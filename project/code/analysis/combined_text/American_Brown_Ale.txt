o
a
good
brown
ale
really
easy
drinking
and
with
enough
complexity
to
warrant
revisiting
this
beer
has
a
dark
brown
color
body
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
smell
has
a
roasty
malt
and
hop
to
it
smell
to
it
the
taste
has
a
maltness
upfront
and
then
a
nice
hop
backbone
the
hop
very
nice
for
a
brown
ale
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
overall
very
tasty
for
a
brown
ale
m
perfectly
bubbly
and
biting
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
a
muddled
hopforward
brown
ale
that
even
with
the
addition
of
extra
hops
still
feels
bland
and
lifeless
feels
and
tastes
like
new
york
waterfront
of
1900s

top
us
brown
ale
the
brownstone
from
sixpoint
was
a
nice
beer
i
tried
at
the
local
tap
house
grill
the
beer
poured
a
clear
brownish
amber
with
12
finger
thick
white
head
that
left
a
nice
lacing
the
smell
was
faint
but
carried
biscuit
and
malt
the
taste
was
a
smooth
well
balanced
brown
that
was
easily
sessionable
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brown
and
worth
a
try
a
thanks
to
the
legendary
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
caramel
taste
is
well
balanced
malts
and
hops
some
caramel
tasty
and
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
and
solid
beer
overall
this
one
could
be
used
to
define
the
american
brown
ale
not
off
the
wall
with
flavor
or
complexity
but
very
well
rounded
and
enjoyable
to
drink
o
tasty
not
overpowering
in
any
way
but
theres
a
nice
balance
of
several
relatively
strong
flavors
very
refreshing
fantastic
appearence
very
good
overall
m
feels
great
in
my
mouth
very
sessionable
does
not
wreck
my
palete
overall
an
awesome
brown
ale
while
an
impressive
looking
pint
brownstone
doesnt
live
up
to
the
promise
of
its
appearance
its
a
good
brown
ale
but
doesnt
really
separate
itself
from
the
pack
ive
had
3
out
of
the
4pack
now
and
one
thing
i
will
say
for
it
is
that
it
went
well
with
sriracha
on
food
a
little
bland
in
the
flavor
arena
but
very
easy
drinking

they
never

that
the

is
nothing
without
the

screams
that
with

nothing
cloying
or
holding
me
back

gravity
did
all
the
work
damn
where
did
the
beer
go
drinkability
is
insane
i
want
a
whole
four
pack
damn
good
balanced
but
hoppier
neo
brown
ale
this
is
really
a
nice
beer
it
has
the
hallmarks
of
a
traditional
brown
ale
with
big
caramel
notes
and
a
faint
nuttiness
this
beer
however
brings
a
big
hop
punch
with
an
intense
citrus
character
and
solid
balanced
bitterness
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
really
interesting
take
on
a
brown
ale
the
hop
flavoring
and
where
it
kicks
in
makes
this
a
surprisingly
refreshing
darker
brew
the
transition
between
the
malts
up
front
and
hops
in
the
back
is
a
bit
weird
and
really
the
only
downside
to
the
flavor
combination
it
was
a
really
smart
move
by
sixpoint
to
release
this
when
they
did
as
the
beer
is
a
great
segue
from
lighter
refreshing
summer
beers
to
the
m√§rzensoktoberfests
and
pumpkin
ales
of
the
fall
o
very
solid
one
of
the
better
sixpoint
offerings
ive
had
hoppedup
dark
beers
tend
to
be
hit
or
miss
and
id
reckon
this
is
an
almost
unqualified
hit
and
needless
to
say
it
works
far
better
than
diesel
did
i
say
almost
because
it
does
lack
a
couple
things
such
as
complexity
but
id
have
no
trouble
revisiting
this
one
again
o
overall
a
beer
that
is
intriquing
with
many
layers
of
complexity
when
savored
and
slowly
explored
yet
just
as
enjoyable
to
drink
in
multiples
just
kicking
back
6
pack
worthy
and
yes
i
couldnt
help
but
hum
mr
brownstone
by
gnr
during
drinking
up
front
the
taste
is
alive
with
sweet
flavorful
malts
caramel
as
it
warms
and
a
low
to
moderate
hop
bitterness
on
the
tail
end
that
gently
goes
to
sleep
as
you
finish
it
off
this
is
the
kind
of
brown
ale
that
i
like
kudos
to
6point
on
this
one
it
has
a
good
brown
malt
flavor
but
it
is
a
bit
short
on
the
flavor
its
soft
and
drinkable
but
nothing
very
exciting
its
a
decent
brown
ale
but
nothing
id
go
crazy
over
i
dont
generally
care
for
brown
ales
without
the
load
of
flavor
that
this
lacks
sixpoint
continues
to
underwhelm
o
very
solid
nothing
earthshattering
but
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
not
to
pour
into
a
glass
and
give
a
full
analysiswriteup
but
to
kick
back
and
sip
as
this
will
be
a
fantastic
session
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
slight
red
hints
with
an
off
white
head
smells
of
earthy
hops
surprising
for
a
brown
ale
tastes
of
dark
malt
and
earthy
hops
nice
combination
carbonation
is
right
for
its
light
body
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
i
would
get
this
again
its
a
pretty
solid
brown
ale
o
i
enjoy
this
beer
but
just
cant
seem
to
get
bored
with
it
for
a
full
four
pack
of
this
one
im
sure
ill
try
it
again
someday
but
it
isnt
one
of
those
i
feel
must
stay
in
the
fridge
at
all
times
taste
has
a
nice
depth
of
flavor
with
a
slightly
roasted
malt
bill
and
some
biscuit
notes
drinks
sweet
but
has
a
slight
bitter
finish
easy
drinking
and
a
silky
smooth
feel
with
depth
of
character
its
a
winner
in
my
opinion
can
i
have
another
one
please
ever
since
the
cosby
show
ive
wanted
to
live
in
a
brownstone
somewhere
call
me
weird
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
honeyladen
biscuit
light
maple
syrup
mild
grass
light
walnut
and
a
hint
of
incredibly
vague
citrus
rind
way
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
stronger
contingent
of
grass
a
slightly
stronger
contingent
of
citrus
and
a
dried
version
of
the
honey
and
syrup
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
little
brown
ale
nothing
overtly
special
but
a
decent
option
for
the
style
overall
this
is
very
nice
fare
and
for
a
comparatively
low
6
abv
has
good
flavor
and
presence
even
over
the
course
of
several
mouthfuls
it
could
have
still
used
a
bit
more
oomph
for
even
more
presence
and
the
sugars
needed
to
be
stronger
to
better
make
themselves
noticed
against
the
hops
and
breads
still
what
is
given
in
here
is
drinkable
and
delicious
poured
from
a
tallboy
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazed
slightly
muddled
amberbrown
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
offwhite
surface
coating
aromas
of
hazelnut
sweetness
with
a
creamy
undertone
the
nose
is
not
overpowering
but
it
is
inviting
flavors
are
very
rich
and
extremely
roasty
wow
the
aromas
lull
you
into
a
false
sense
of
passiveness
and
then
you
get
a
fireroasted
nut
sweetness
and
richness
followed
by
sharp
characteristics
from
both
the
thin
carbonated
body
as
well
as
the
lingering
charcoal
highlights
some
candied
sweet
characteristics
build
slowly
as
you
continue
to
drink
but
the
rich
and
roasty
carry
you
through
the
whole
brew
the
body
is
light
and
remains
able
to
support
the
robust
flavors
slick
clean
finish
with
only
the
slightest
shortlived
linger
of
sweet
solid
brown
overall
not
overly
impressed
but
it
is
above
average
decent
but
not
amazing
if
i
had
to
place
this
somewhere
i
would
call
it
new
castles
bigger
brother
or
a
porter
in
training
o
not
my
favorite
sixpoint
offering
but
still
an
enjoyable
ale
went
quite
nicely
with
cheeseburgers
deep
ruby
brown
color
with
a
onefinger
white
head
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
caramel
sweetness
in
the
aroma
with
noticable
floral
hop
bitterness
flavor
consisted
of
a
roasted
malt
backbone
and
doughy
yeast
medium
bodied
with
a
clean
finish
o
this
is
a
style
we
almost
always
pass
up
glad
we
slowed
down
enough
to
let
this
one
hop
on
board
o
a
fantastic
take
on
a
brown
ale
a
great
brew
ill
be
drinking
more
d
good
flavors
but
a
little
muddled
in
my
opinion
these
guys
have
some
better
brews
out
there
that
i
would
recommend
over
brownstone
however
keep
in
mind
i
really
do
not
like
brown
ales
to
start
with
but
i
always
enjoy
tasting
different
beers
not
only
for
my
personal
reviews
but
it
helps
when
it
comes
to
describing
various
beers
to
our
customers
well
constructed
like
all
six
point
products
ive
enjoyed
this
one
seems
like
a
prototype
and
foundation
for
many
other
varieties
they
brew
overall
a
good
beer
but
definitely
more
hop
forward
than
an
english
brown
and
my
preference
tangy
with
a
light
bitterness
nutty
malt
character
a
drying
and
mildly
hoppy
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
little
bit
of
astringency
and
bittering
hops
light
carbonation
a
fairly
straightforward
brown
ale
thats
a
bit
hoppier
than
the
usual
brownstone
is
great
beer
and
one
i
would
take
down
with
some
bbq
it
seems
like
a
great
match
6
leads
to
all
day
drinking
solid
brownale
without
having
to
use
a
heavy
bill
of
roast
malts
instead
it
relies
on
good
use
of
nutty
and
toasted
malts
which
is
certainly
nice
for
a
change
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
hopped
up
amber
ale
than
a
brown
ale
but
to
each
his
own
the
extra
hops
are
much
welcomed
and
make
this
something
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
again
the
can
is
always
a
plus
in
my
book
as
well
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
out
there
overall
a
bit
bitter
for
a
brown
ale
even
an
american
one
still
quite
drinkable
and
definitely
worth
having
again
average
fingers
worth
of
tan
foam
moderate
dimpling
across
the
surface
disappears
steadily
but
final
retention
near
the
surface
is
very
good
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
hazy
brown
liquid
with
a
strong
orange
influence
almost
looks
like
rusty
water
very
active
carbonation
throughout
the
nose
does
a
good
job
of
creating
an
even
spit
between
sweeter
chocolate
toffee
crunch
cola
bean
notes
and
an
earthier
grassier
hop
presence
almost
metallic
or
minerally
at
times
nothing
here
has
too
much
cutting
punch
to
it
while
also
stays
firm
maybe
could
soak
in
a
bit
more
for
added
length
mediumbodied
comes
on
quickly
with
carbonated
churn
in
the
mouth
which
likely
keeps
it
drying
than
otherwise
might
be
soso
richness
to
the
cocoa
malt
caramel
coffee
bean
flavors
not
a
lot
of
roast
but
there
is
decent
yeastiness
in
a
dry
powder
form
less
earthy
and
minerally
here
about
same
level
of
herbaceousness
with
a
run
up
in
pine
and
grapefruit
pith
no
real
fruit
flavors
curiously
sweeter
colder
than
as
it
warms
extends
the
finish
well
without
sacrificing
freshness
the
bitterness
could
be
ratcheted
back
o
nicely
done
brown
ale
maybe
one
of
the
leading
in
the
style
six
point
is
never
a
let
down
and
a
huge
value
as
far
as
great
beer
in
cans
o
a
far
cry
from
the
draft
version
i
remember
from
the
redhook
brewery
overall
perfectly
balanced
tastes
wonderful
and
is
incredibly
satisfying
this
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
o
an
easy
drinking
brown
ale
brownstone
is
crisp
and
clean
with
great
malt
and
hop
balance
for
an
understated
result
sixpoint
packs
in
delicate
nuances
which
prevail
when
contemplating
its
nature
but
are
comfortable
being
lost
in
its
drinkability
o
good
beer
but
im
not
overly
impressed
with
the
style
to
begin
with
i
thought
it
was
ok
but
i
doubt
ill
buy
another
can
a
bit
raw
but
certainly
not
unfinished
layers
peel
away
with
each
sip
as
it
warms
up
ive
had
this
on
tap
many
times
and
the
can
seems
to
have
held
on
to
all
of
this
greatness
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
american
brewed
browns
poured
into
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
appearance
is
a
moderate
brown
with
reddish
hues
and
a
touch
of
cloudiness
nice
2
finger
head
upon
pour
with
good
retention
the
nose
features
caramel
cream
faint
chocolate
and
earthy
hops
the
nose
suggest
that
the
flavor
is
going
to
be
subtle
with
a
decent
presence
of
both
malt
and
hops
taste
starts
with
some
roasted
malt
character
which
i
barely
picked
up
on
the
nose
some
crusty
bread
comes
in
with
a
touch
of
caramel
character
the
taste
finishes
with
a
hop
note
this
brown
ale
has
a
decent
bit
of
character
and
is
also
unique
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
high
carabonation
overall
worth
a
try
especially
if
brown
ales
are
your
thing
16

fairly
cloudy

dense
khaki
head
with
fantastic

that
reduces
to
a

that
lasts

foamy
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
caramel
biscuit
grass
herbal
grapefruit
pine
chocolate
toast

pretty
nice
and
pleasant
aromas
with
decent

taste
of
caramel

grapefruit
biscuit
pine
grass
orange

chocolate
and
light

on

notes
of

citrus
pine
grass
biscuit
and
light
nuttiness
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
pretty
good
flavor
balance
but
is
very
much
hop
forward
with
hardly
any
noticeable
darker
malts
until
after
the
finish
no
cloying
flavors
or
sweetness
at
all
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
farily
creamy
and
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
almost
zero
warming
noticed
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
could
have
use
more
prominent
chocolate
roasted
flavors
in
my
opinion
but
was
still
nicely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
quite
enjoyable
a
solid
brown
ale
a
bit
hoppier
than
most
goes
down
real
easy
a
winner
o
really
pleasant
brown
and
a
good
one
to
pair
with
dessert
i
did
first
sip
is
pleasingly
refreshing
effervescent
mild
hop
flavor
sweet
crystal
malt
backbone
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
certainly
a
hoppy
take
on
the
style
but
it
works
nicely
i
feel
it
could
use
a
bit
more
body
or
malt
sweetness
but
thats
a
relatively
minor
fault
the
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
pretty
solid
enjoyable
as
are
most
sixpoint
beers
decent
drinkable
nothing
remarkable
though
overall
this
is
a
good
offering
from
sixpoint
but
just
like
all
their
recent
can
releases
i
enjoyed
their
beers
a
lot
more
back
when
everything
was
draft
only
not
enough
malt
to
balance
the
emerging
hoppy
bitterness
which
ruins
the
overall
flavor
profile
for
me
here
o
overall
sixpoint
has
been
a
big
hit
or
miss
brewery
for
me
this
one
falls
more
on
the
hit
side
than
the
miss
side
but
im
not
a
fan
of
this
one
in
the
way
i
was
of
crisp
or
righteous
or
apollo
but
this
is
definitely
up
there
this
is
certainly
a
brewery
to
watch
as
they
are
maturing
and
refining
their
process
their
beers
are
solid
they
had
an
incredible
reputation
when
draft
only
and
they
are
starting
to
come
into
their
own
learning
from
the
canning
process
i
wouldnt
write
off
any
of
their
beers
upon
first
taste
as
they
are
worth
checking
out
each
batch
as
they
are
taking
feedback
and
tweaking
this
is
a
solid
brown
with
some
unique
notes
in
the
flavor
served
from
a
16
oz
can
pours
with
a
massive
light
tan
head
that
has
decent
retention
a
bit
less
lacing
than
i
would
have
expected
initially
beer
itself
is
a
hazy
nearly
opaque
medium
copperorange
aroma
is
pleasant
but
lacking
in
the
overall
toasty
caramel
presence
i
associate
with
this
style
there
is
a
definite
presence
of
assertive
citrusy
hops
aroma
though
which
really
pushes
the
malt
to
there
rear
leaving
it
almost
as
an
afterthought
again
taste
is
pleasant
but
still
lacking
in
the
crucial
roasted
and
caramel
notes
for
the
style
there
is
far
more
hops
presence
here
than
i
care
for
in
a
brown
ale
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
crispness
added
by
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
however
it
drinks
far
more
like
a
pale
ale
than
a
brown
ale
a
rare
semi
disappointment
from
a
brewery
that
is
rapidly
gaining
my
appreciation
odanother
crazy
sixpoint
ale
that
i
am
truly
digging
alcohol
does
come
out
here
and
there
but
thats
my
only
real
critique
of
this
brew
complex
great
looking
and
easydrinking
another
hit
perfect
for
the
beginning
of
autumn
very
nice
give
it
a
go
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
has
some
nice
light
cocoa
and
toffee
malts
as
well
as
a
good
bit
of
grass
and
some
earth
the
flavor
is
very
similar
the
toffee
and
dusty
chocolate
notes
come
through
initially
but
there
is
also
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
for
a
brown
ale
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
grass
flavor
from
the
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
take
on
a
brown
ale
overall
its
straightforward
and
well
done
a
great
session
brew
no
doubt
a
great
beer
from
sixpoint
the
cans
are
usually
hit
or
miss
this
one
is
a
solid
goto
much
like
the
crisp
o
interesting
brown
ale
i
would
say
its
in
between
a
brown
and
an
ipa
but
good
beer
never
the
less
16oz
can
pours
brown
with
some
reddish
hues
when
held
to
a
light
nice
frothy
beige
head
holds
excellent
retention
and
leaves
all
kinds
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
toasted
malt
chocolate
malt
grassy
hops
tastes
are
chocolate
malt
fresh
hops
toasty
grain
unexpected
hint
of
pine
nice
balance
with
a
hoppy
bite
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thinmedium
somewhat
resiny
good
carbonation
this
was
hoppier
than
expected
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
nice
american
brown
ale
check
this
out
if
you
want
a
simple
drinkable
brown
ale
that
you
can
also
take
to
the
beach
or
public
gatherings
where
glass
is
forbidden
o
i
like
this
for
the
most
part
yet
for
a
brown
the
hops
are
a
bit
too
much
in
front
of
the
malts
the
first
quote
is
from
the
poem
letter
to
n
y
by
elizabeth
bishop
the
crack
and
glug
was
from
my
kitchen
i
could
not
invert
the
can
but
the
massive
head
that
formed
anyway
created
a
cascading
action
as
it
fell
away
to
become
liquid
i
had
a
dense
twoplus
fingers
of
lighttan
head
with
great
retention
when
all
was
said
and
done
color
was
a
reddishbrown
with
nequality
clarity
but
not
deep
enough
in
its
shade
to
be
called
mahogany
nose
had
a
real
hop
presence
to
it
very
piney
underlain
by
a
slight
malty
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
hops
really
presented
up
front
followed
by
a
light
chocolaty
sweetness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
dry
mostly
from
the
hops
but
the
extreme
finish
allowed
me
to
experience
the
malt
again
once
more
they
are
not
doing
things
to
style
but
that
suits
me
just
fine
overall
an
easy
drinking
brown
with
some
light
flavors
something
in
my
gut
tells
me
this
on
tap
or
nitro
would
make
it
sing
overall
this
is
one
of
the
more
disappointing
sixpoint
beers
ive
had
i
doubt
ill
finish
the
can
this
brown
ale
is
so
hopforward
that
it
pushes
the
boundaries
of
pale
ale
levels
of
hopping
it
certainly
makes
things
interesting
however
the
cost
of
the
high
hopping
seems
to
be
the
obscuring
of
the
nutty
and
bready
elements
of
a
typical
brown
ale
ymmv
both
smooth
and
crisp
theres
a
good
feel
to
this
mediumbodied
beer
which
has
more
going
for
it
than
most
browns
its
not
thick
by
any
means
but
it
possesses
a
depth
most
in
this
typically
middleoftheroad
style
dont
its
also
a
pretty
dry
feel
but
not
too
abrasive
as
the
malts
sitting
beneath
the
hops
add
their
own
just
enough
sweetness
to
keep
it
from
chalky
and
make
it
great
16oz
tall
boy
with

before

stamped
on
the
bottom
of
the
can
good
amount
of
lacing
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
inch
of
frothy
head
almost
looks
like
a
glass
of
coke
aromas
of
citrus
hops
nuts
pine
earth
and
malts
taste
is
citrus
hops
caramel
malts
earthiness
and
nuts
actually
has
a
bit
of
a
cola
taste
to
it
floral
at
the
end
bubbly
light
mouthfeel
highly
carbonated
overall
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
out
there
sixpoint
does
it
again
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
in
an
evening
the
beer
is
enjoyable
and
pairs
well
with
foods
from
pub
fare
to
upscale
the
flavor
profile
seems
to
have
shifted
just
a
bit
with
a
little
hop
presence
since
this
moved
to
a
year
round
offering
in
cans
notes
a
solid
beer
and
nicely
drinkable
cheers
o
all
around
good
brown
ale
o
sixpoint
does
it
again
making
an
enjoyable
brown
ale
that
possesses
a
sweet
maltiness
with
a
desired
piney
hop
finish
thanks
o
extremely
happy
with
this
drinking
experience
an
incredible
version
of
the
style
just
wish
the
can
was
matte
brown
like
apollo
is
matte
white
instead
of
chrome
ha
overall
nice
smooth
and
flavorfull
more
hoppy
then
most
brown
ales
ive
had
still
its
balanced
well
has
nice
bitterness
along
with
sweetness
great
affordable
price
good
flavor
worth
a
drink
for
sure
o
definitely
an
american
take
on
brown
ales
very
hoppy
especially
towards
the
finish
lots
of
lingering
resinous
bitterness
between
sips
not
as
strong
on
the
toasted
malt
as
most
brown
ales
perhaps
obscured
a
bit
by
the
hoppiness
honestly
its
more
ipa
than
brown
ale
but
i
happen
to
like
hops
so
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
weak
brown
ale
base
with
a
good
hop
profile
sixpoint
definitely
cut
down
on
the
yeast
profile
from
the
last
time
i
had
this
beer
would
love
to
see
more
body
to
this
beer
its
reminicent
of
bear
republicfat
headsstone
tba
which
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
either
this
brown
ale
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
bit
less
sweet
and
more
hops
than
typical
it
has
a
great
fresh
aroma
and
a
lovely
taste
and
aftertaste
it
looks
great
in
a
glass
and
it
seems
to
transport
well
i
dragged
this
one
with
me
to
moline
il
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
great
stuff
o
overall
a
very
nice
brown
ale
ton
of
malts
and
nuts
and
very
easy
to
drink
hope
they
can
this
one
would
like
to
have
it
again
o
not
a
very
complex
beer
but
a
nice
easy
drinker
especially
at
6
the
16
oz
can
is
another
plus
too
definitely
worthy
of
their
newest
yearround
addition
reminiscent
of
dfhs
iba
for
comparisons
sake
sixpoints
brownstone
pours
a
nice
chestnut
brown
about
two
fingers
of
just
off
white
foam
caps
the
beer
displaying
some
nice
head
retention
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
left
around
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
dry
roasty
chocolate
aroma
buttressed
by
a
somewhat
intense
spicyherbal
note
bitter
dark
chocolate
shows
up
in
the
flavor
as
well
but
some
nuttiness
adds
a
bit
of
malt
complexity
that
the
nose
was
lacking
the
bitterness
that
comes
through
next
is
definitely
on
the
restrained
side
the
hop
finish
is
much
more
bold
with
lots
of
herb
and
spice
flavors
showing
up
the
body
is
just
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
for
a
brown
ale
especially
given
that
its
paired
with
a
mildly
assertive
carbonation
i
enjoyed
my
glass
of
brownstone
but
the
slightly
lackluster
malt
presence
makes
it
come
across
as
what
one
might
imagine
a
brown
ipa
would
be
rather
than
a
brown
ale
o
overall
this
beer
just
gets
better
and
better
i
would
recommend
drinking
it
at
about
50
degrees
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
hoppy
it
was
these
made
for
a
really
great
balance
with
those
bittering
malts
the
malts
in
themselves
were
complex
and
dry
but
we
wished
they
were
a
bit
more
potent
in
both
the
nose
and
the
flavoring
this
beer
was
a
nice
complement
to
our
shepherds
pie
and
vinegar
fries
there
are
few
american
brown
ales
that
showcase
the
hop
cone
this
well
with
all
the
flavor
of
malt
but
with
the
dryness
and
hoppy
display
brownstone
sings
the
praises
of
what
the
american
attitude
can
be
in
this
indigenous
adaptation
this
and
dogfish
heads
india
brown
ale
are
in
a
class
all
their
own
the
cask
version
was
the
same
good
but
not
overwhelming
in
any
way
worth
trying
the
nose
is
bready
and
a
bit
hoppy
the
upfront
flavor
is
nutty
like
a
classic
brown
but
thinner
than
a
toptier
version
of
this
style
there
is
also
some
caramel
in
the
flavor
the
roasted
bitterness
on
the
finish
was
quite
nice
o
very
good
brown
ale
challenges
the
style
and
six
point
continues
to
impress
me
o
awesome
brown
ale
i
really
like
brown
ales
like
this
the
ones
that
have
stoutlike
characteristics
but
also
have
a
good
hop
presence
and
sweet
nuttiness
im
a
sixpoint
fan
and
this
one
is
no
exception
it
has
a
little
bit
of
everything
in
it
with
an
interesting
balance
of
malt
hops
and
yeast
a
dark
brown
beer
with
a
small
creamy
head
that
tapers
down
to
a
wisp
on
top
nearly
opaque
nice
sheets
of
creamy
lace
cling
to
the
glass
a
floral
hop
aroma
with
a
backbone
of
toasty
malt
flavor
puts
the
toasted
malts
in
front
but
its
also
nicely
hopped
and
grassy
as
sixpoint
beers
tend
to
be
creamy
mouthfeel
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
medium
long
finish
with
a
solid
blend
of
the
hops
and
malt
as
it
fades
very
well
balanced
between
the
two
definitely
more
hop
forward
that
a
traditional
brown
ale
really
enjoyed
this
another
winner
from
sixpoint
o
solid
brown
ale
like
the
sort
of
hop
character
another
solid
offering
from
sixpoint
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
wonderful
tan
head
on
top
very
nice
robust
look
to
it
almost
a
cedar
hue
to
it
the
aroma
was
a
big
suprise
rich
cocoa
and
hints
of
roasted
malts
touches
of
caramel
as
well
as
a
light
tobacco
touch
to
it
really
huge
brown
ale
here
smooth
mellow
carbonation
rich
creamy
profile
with
each
sip
having
to
be
savored
time
and
time
again
lots
of
rich
caramel
malts
wash
across
the
tongue
with
the
very
first
sip
and
so
it
begins
as
the
smooth
mellow
cocoa
notes
start
to
come
together
and
mixed
with
a
light
earthy
bitter
hoppiness
overall
a
really
nice
brown
alt
the
malt
backbone
was
great
and
the
hops
complimented
it
well
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
is
a
solid
brown
ale
and
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
glasses
of
this
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
another
hit
from
sixpoint
i
recommend
trying
it
had
this
brew
on
tap
at
gingerman
nyc
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
roughly
a
fingers
worth
of
head
great
taste
of
malty
roastiness
in
the
mouth
and
very
smooth
tasting
tasted
like
a
surly
furious
and
bender
put
together
in
a
delicious
pint
of
beer
would
definitely
have
it
again
and
again
another
solid
brew
from
sixpoint
milk
chocolate
brown
in
color
with
a
muddy
appearance
poured
with
a
steady
off
white
head
that
leaaves
a
ladder
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
roasted
malt
toffee
and
spicy
herbal
hop
aromas
a
bit
smokey
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
this
didnt
seem
to
fit
any
specific
style
guideline
but
it
was
like
a
cross
between
an
esb
and
brown
ale
roasted
malt
and
toffee
flavors
up
front
with
spicy
herbal
hops
being
added
through
the
middle
and
to
the
end
roasted
malt
flavors
transition
to
coffee
at
the
finish
which
is
fairly
dry
certainly
have
never
has
anything
quite
like
this
before
d
overall
it
was
a
pretty
tasty
and
interesting
take
on
the
beer
well
worth
a
try
o
another
good
offering
from
sixpoint
perhaps
this
guy
will
make
it
into
the
canning
lines
d
easy
to
drink
but
it
suffers
the
same
fate
as
most
american
brown
ales
its
boring
the
addition
of
hops
might
seem
prudent
on
paper
but
this
implementation
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
pours
a
deep
rich
brown
with
a
small
amout
of
red
tint
the
head
was
at
least
a
thumb
tall
and
a
gorgeous
off
white
color
the
smell
was
very
different
from
the
last
brown
i
had
and
was
malty
with
a
nice
espresso
finish
there
was
also
somethig
very
different
i
could
not
place
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
amazingly
balanced
chocolate
and
espresso
migle
great
with
a
nice
malty
and
barley
or
grainy
flavor
very
well
i
love
how
smoth
this
beer
goes
down
and
how
the
flavors
mix
so
well
this
is
a
great
beer
get
it
whenever
you
can
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
i
could
still
see
through
the
glass
the
nose
was
roasted
malt
with
some
light
chocolate
notes
tastes
is
toasted
and
faint
chocolate
a
malty
sweet
body
but
with
a
good
hop
kick
there
was
a
lot
of
zesty
hops
over
the
malt
that
left
a
dryness
which
complimented
the
toastedroasted
malts
i
wonder
if
its
a
bad
batch
or
tap
that
i
got
it
from
looking
over
the
other
reviews
i
feel
like
i
should
have
loved
this
brew
but
i
dont
see
myself
having
it
again
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
very
smooth
with
very
low
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
slight
dry
finish
overall
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
which
pleasantly
surprised
me
with
the
huge
hop
presence
drink
is
good
light
little
biter
but
a
nice
malty
balance
sessionable
dry
finish
little
sticky
though
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
brown
and
a
great
beer
from
sixpoint
this
is
my
first
sixpoint
beer
and
its
giving
me
something
to
look
out
for
ill
be
trying
any
sixpoints
i
see
on
tap
from
now
on
worth
a
try
if
browns
are
your
thing
cheers
d
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
this
is
right
there
behind
kick
ass
brown

with

lovers
ticket
to

the
taste
matches
with
a
lightmoderate
body
with
some
carbonation
i
did
not
get
bored
drinking
a
liter
of
this
excellent
brown
ale
especially
on
cask
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
it
also
goes
very
well
with
food
particularly
a
burger
very
little
aroma
but
if
i
pulled
hard
i
could
detect
a
bit
of
caramel
and
some
smoky
beef
rather
thin
body
rather
thin
taste
more
caramel
and
some
vanilla
maybe
a
few
raisins
had
a
reasonably
wet
finish
which
i
like
in
this
style
went
well
with
a
terrific
seafood
stew
an
average
brown
ale
not
great
but
not
bad
you
could
do
worse
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
d
very
drinkable
in
fact
i
ordered
another
pint
of
it
d
tasty
and
goes
down
remarkably
easy
this
is
one
to
sit
with
for
an
evening
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
more
complex
brown
ales
i
have
had
i
know
there
is
a
flavor
in
there
i
cannot
put
my
hand
on
the
nuttiness
is
there
to
match
some
other
sweet
flavors
great
brew
wish
i
could
find
this
in
bottles
this
is
an
easily
sessionable
brown
ale
hearty
flavorful
and
relatively
low
in
abv
d
good
and
because
of
low
abv
can
be
consumed
more
often
i
am
not
a
fan
of
brown
ales
as
i
find
most
of
them
warrant
a
fork
knife
to
be
ingested
that
being
said
this
beer
blew
my
mind
appearance
is
standard
for
a
brown
ale
deep
mahogany
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
fair
lacing
the
smell
yielded
notes
of
roasted
malt
coffee
cocoa
powder
toffee
and
piney
hops
the
flavor
was
amazing
first
the
maltysweetness
hits
you
then
the
hop
essence
blends
in
and
then
it
finishes
with
a
roasted
nut
flavor
that
is
not
overpowering
i
even
detected
the
piney
hops
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
in
my
mind
was
the
best
part
this
was
a
mediumbodied
brown
ale
that
felt
adequately
carbonated
easy
on
the
palate
and
very
drinkable
the
only
sessionable
brown
ale
that
ive
ever
come
across
ive
butted
heads
with
some
friends
over
some
of
sixpoints
offerings
but
this
the
bengali
ipa
and
the
apollo
wheat
really
won
me
over
ill
try
any
new
beer
these
guys
concoct
d
i
think
that
6
point
quietly
puts
out
some
solid
beers
i
have
not
had
their
whole
lineup
but
i
have
yet
to
have
a
bummer
beer
from
them
the
brownstone
is
a
good
example
a
real
good
brown
ale
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
everything
ive
ever
had
from
sixpoint
has
been
excellent
if
you
ever
find
yourself
in
nyc
venture
down
to
the
redhook

of

and
pop
into

wont
be

drinkers
its
got
the
hops
sweets
and
roast
balanced
out
to
create
a
wellrounded
brew
d
ive
had
this
a
couple
of
times
now
and
it
never
fails
to
blow
my
mind
its
full
its
rich
its
complex
its
got
everything
and
it
nonetheless
does
not
overwhelm
everything
is
right
about
this
beer

side
an

definitely
on

side
the

certainly
compliments
the
beer
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
find
it
round
and
soft
with
its
carbonation
and
slightly
buttery
in
its
finish
for
all
of
that
this

goes

and
the

was

which
i
love
because
thats
the
way
a

should
be
hearty

drinkable

decent
for
a
brown
ale
d
all
things
considered
not
too
shabby
it
does
lack
compared
to
some
of
the
other
sixpoint
brews
ive
had
moderate
carbonation
with
a
light
to
medium
body
great
example
of
what
one
would
define
as
an
american
brown
being
complex
enough
to
have
a
great
mix
of
both
would
love
to

the
spicy

at

end
give
it
the
festive
holiday
aroma
no
nuts
in
the
nose
but
all
the
malt
of
a
brown
ale
taste
is
very
similar
but
it
has
more
hops
which
seem
floral
to
go
along
with
the
pine
cone
taste
and
it
has
additional
spices
like
cumin
and
cinnamon
which
make
the
flavor
way
more
winter
seasonal
the
toasted
grains
and
malts
are
strong
and
work
well
with
the
hops
and
spices
but
im
not
a
huge
winter

so
i
was
hoping
for
more

should
have
expected
the
spice
rack
in

mouthfeel
is
light

almost
watery
with
a
lighter

a

the

the

into
something
of
a
middling
experience
but
one
that
uplifts
the
usual
brown
ale
and
its
oftenpredictable
genre
not
a
bad
festive
brown
ale
though
not
one
i
would
reach
out
for
a
sixer
of
had
on
draft
in
a
downtown
loop
bar
and
grill
no
discernible
spices
here
though
this
does
hint
at
having
some
orange
peel
in
there
and
candied
fruits
decent
enough
but
i
would
pick
out
many
other
seasonal
winter
warmers
or
brown
ales
over
this
the
scent
is
reminiscent
of
a
nice
madeira
or
possibly
a

some
sort
of
dessert
wine
the
taste
though
not

overall
a
nice
creamy
and
toasty
brown
ale
i
wouldnt
necessarily
buy
this
again
but
it
was
tasty
for
what
it
was
creamy
and
malty
with
slightly
bitter
finish
clearish
ruby
with
a
very
creamy
yellowed
head
that
leaves
sheets
of

but
wellrounded
and
balanced
nutty

earthy

tobacco
and
a

of
cinnamon
creamy
plush
mouthfeel
that
dries
out
a
bit
pretty
damn
solid
all
around
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
it
may
be
a
bit
closer
to
a
belgian
dark
than
an
american
brown
though
great
flavors
and
a
solid
complexity
without
any
apparent
faults
a
very
enjoyable
drink
from
goose
island
and
it
certainly
isnt
christmas
ale
under
another
name
not
quite
as
fullbodied
and
malty
as
last
years
offering
but
delicious
nonetheless
this
wonderful
ale
is
sweet
and
fruity
i
generally
like
the
hoppy
ipas
so
this
is
definitely
not
my
usual
fare
but
i
love
this
ale
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
a
cordial
warm
and
welcoming
the
substantial
alcohol
offsets
the
sweetness
beautifully
on
tap
this
is
a
winter
gem
overall
has
a
sweet
caramel
malt
taste
this
beer
is
very
smooth
with
a
semithick
body
a
very
solid
take
on
a
brown
ale
definitely
a
winter
ale
everyone
should
try
nice
colour
and
taste
decent
smoothness
there
i
submitted
a
review
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
brown
ale
good
toasty
malt
notes
with
some
really
nice
dark
fruit
undertones
other
than
a
cut
of
alcohol
when
cold
and
a
bit
too
much
bitterness
i
found
this
to
be
very
well
done
kind
of
an
odd
one
here
not
really
falling
in
love
but
not
dismissing
this
guy
altogether
either
o
a
solid
holidaytime
brown
ale
with
plenty
of
maltiness
it
is
able
to
keep
the
sweetness
down
to
a
point
but
it
could
definitely
get
a
little
cloying
after
a
couple
might
be
better
in
a
4pack
but
thats
just
my
opinion
worth
a
shot
if
youre
into
browns
a
pleasant
spiced
brown
ale
didnt
like
at
all
not
a
fan

fruit

should
have
read
the
label
better
this
beer
is
slightly
spiced
and
thin
the
head
is

the
color
is
an

the
taste
is
good
spicy
brown

nutmeg
and
some
clove
feel
is
watery
worked
as
part
of
a
chicken
marinade
as
pretty
much
any
brown
ale
does
o
decent
but
underwhelming
for
a
brown

the
taste

a
hoppy

of

my
personal
preference

the

has
a
dark
cocoa
and
slight

taste
with
mild

and
currant
accent
with
slight
earthy
taste
verging
on
woody
with
mild

smoothness
and
toasted
malt
in
the
middle
with
slight
spice
from
the
hops
to
balance
with
gentle
alcohol
as
it
finishes
more
dry
than
sweet
the
taste
is
decent
for
a
strong
brown
with
a
hint
of
yeast
in
the
taste
to
add
complexity
and
balanced
well
with
semitoasty
and
fruity
elements
which
fit
the
style
well
i
could
drink
this
frequentlyvery
enjoyable
american
style
brown
ale
well
gotta
wait
for
the
bus
to
get
here
so
lets
stop
off
at
wb
and
grab
a
pint
or
two
eh
this
one
pours
a
murky
rubysienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
maple
syrup
backed
by
mild
pine
resin
and
mixed
greens
the
taste
turns
the
tables
leading
with
the
pineled
greens
and
backing
up
with
the
maple
syrup
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
brown
really
but
i
for
one
feel
the
overt
hoppiness
hurts
things
in
general
i
wont
have
another
of
these
as
far
as
i
can
see
but
i
also
wont
dissuade
someone
from
having
one
either
overall
really
tasty
and
unique
loads
of
brown
sugar
and
spiced
apples
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
they
seem
to
really
stay
true
to
style
but
just
amped
up
the
abv
its
not
a
mindblower
but
its
cool
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
perfect
christmas
beer
a
lot
in
this
beer
from
the
aromas
to
the
taste
remind
me
of
christmas
overall
it
seems
like
another
tweaking
of
their
past
holiday
beers
but
i
think
they
nailed
it
this
time
great
taste
with
an
even
better
mouthfeel
overall
coming
from
cleveland
ohio
we
have
the
legendary
great
lakes
christmas
ale
which
is
amazing
dont
get
me
wrong
but
its
alittle
on
the
expensive
side
this
holiday
brown
ales
stands
at
a
stout
7
7
abv
with
50
ibus
and
is
less
than
10
bucks
a
six
pack
whaatt
now
the
50
ibus
is
puzzling
to
me
because
i
dont
find
it
that
bitter
others
may
but
that
is
why
there
are
100000000000
beers
in
the
world
right
take
caution
when
drinking
and
driving
especially
this
one
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
i
hope
you
liked
my
review
we
need
this
beer
in
the
90s

make
this
your
staple

ale
pours
a
hazy
reddishmahogany
in
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
some
ringlike
lacing
is
seen
after
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
spice
bit
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
there
is
hints
of
dark
fruits
oak
chips
nuts
and
even
vanilla
pretty
smooth
and
creamy
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
this
brew
is
for
the
cooler
months
as
you
can
tell
by
the
higher
alcohol
content
overall
a
tasty
brew
overall
very
enjoyable
on
sale
in
six
packs
at
our
local
grocery
chains
new
release
great
improved
beer
from
any
other
holiday
offering
i
have
ever
had
from
goose
island
in
the
past
very
enjoyable
flavor
and
balance
throughout
an
absolutely
rich
and
complex
brown
ale
delightful
to
drink
worth
picking
up
a
few
and
sitting
on
them
i
am
going
back
to
the
store
to
pick
up
more
highly
recommended
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
mason
jar
shows
a
wonderful
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
hoppy
with
some
roasted
notes
and
sweetness
the
taste
is
spicy
with
malt
and
hops
present
as
well
as
a
bitterness
that
works
all
the
way
through
the
process
of
sample
mouthfeel
is
light
to
slight
medium
with
everything
working
very
well
with
the
cold
weather
and
holidays
coming
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
around
to
share
with
family
and
friends
if
they
like
a
solid
beer
i
like
goose
island
products
and
this
is
a
winner
the
smell
of
this
can
be
a
bit
off
putting
but
the
taste
is
excellent

on

all
the
warmth
one
would
expect
from
a
winter
warmer
despite
5
years
in
the
bottle
this
is
a
well
made
beer
that
stands
the
test
of
time
the

doesnt
show
at
least
not
at
this
point
overall
this
is
another
very
good
very
tasty
beer
from
goose
island
theres
a
lot
going
on
it
its
flavor
from
the
slightly
sour
cherry
notes
to
the
gingerbread
spices
i
liked
this
very
much
overall
needless
to
say
this
is
over
the
hill
but
it
does
taste
better
than
expected
for
being
7
years
old
theres
still
a
nice
bite
of
holiday
spice
and
some
nutty
maltiness
but
the
thinned
out
body
and
stale
carbonation
really
take
it
down
a
notch
notes
bottled
101211
aged
for
three
years
decent
holiday
beer
that
doesnt
rely
on
spices
to
seem
festive
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
its
a
little
too
onenoted
the
body
is
slightly
on
the
thin
side
it
didnt
wow
me
but
it
was
enjoyable
for
what
it
was

aged

years
deep
caramel

with

great
beer
to

i
recommend
this
beer
if
you
like
a
sweeter
beer
no
real
hoppy
bitterness
to
speak
of
with
a
nice
warming
aftertaste
spot
on
christmas
ale
will
pickup
more
pours
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
3mm
beige
head
that
settles
down
to
just
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
sediment
is
seen
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
aroma
is
like
a
good
seasonal
christmas
winter
brew
with
holiday
spices
brown
sugar
caramel
dark
fruits
and
dark
bread
the
taste
is
close
to
that
with
lots
of
tasty
flavors
mixed
in
for
a
good
balance
good
mix
of
spices
as
you
can
taste
some
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
others
spices
as
well
as
some
toffee
very
nice
and
no
bitter
or
harsh
finish
medium
to
medium
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
just
makes
you
wish
for
cooler
weather
since
it
has
been
in

80s
for
most
of

overall
a
great

christmas

2012

even
though
the
abv
was
not
exceptionally
high
this
offering
appeared
to
age
very
well
the
bottle
calls
this
a
american
brown
ale
but
honestly
it
pours
more
like
a
belgian
spiced
dubble
theres
a
light
low
aroma
of
dried
stone
fruits
raisin
and
dates
with
a
sweet
and
sweetlyspiced
flavor
of
cloves
and
allspice
blended
with
the
raisin
and
dates
i
found
it
a
delicious
and
welcome
surprise
overall
i
have
concluded
that
the
2012
bottle
had
gone
bad
there
was
a
tiny
bit
of
rust
under
the
cap
and
the
beer
displayed
some
very
off
flavors
and
scents
both
fairly
consistent
with
oxidation
as
for
the
2011
it
is
still
a
pretty
good
beer
im
not
sure
this
will
develop
in
the
bottle
for
up
to
5
years
still
this
is
a
fairly
complex
brown
ale
which
is
saying
something
for
most
brown
ales
ratings
are
for
the
2011
had
the
2011
edition
pured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
the
whole
aging
in
the
bottle
thing
when
it
comes
to
beer
and
what
the
science
is
behind
that
i
guess
to
see
the
effects
youd
essentially
by
a
four
pack
and
drink
one
each
year
or
by
the
same
years
4
pack
every
year
for
5
years
or
so
seems
like
a
lot
of
work
anyway
not
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
it
had
a
nice
nutty
flavor
to
it
but
there
was
an
overpowering
soursweetness
to
it
that
i
didnt
love
hazy
brown
color
that
wasnt
super
appetizing
i
prefer
their
sixth
day
around
the
holidays
i
think
o
not
sure
why
i
though
i
should
age
this
didnt
blow
me
away
last
year
wishful
thinking
it
might
improve
significantly
in
a
year
i
suppose
save
your
cellar
space
and
just
drink
this
fresh
notes
quite
impressive
this
is
like
a
ramped
up
version
of
their
brown
ale
with
much
higher
hops
and
some
dark
fruits
it
is
complex
with
multiple
layers
of
flavor
yet
another
great
beer
from
goose
island
overall
first
time
im
having
this
and
goose
island
comes
once
again
delivers
nothing
but
gems
its
a
tad
sweet
for
some
i
think
its
just
right
when
i
catch
the
next
batch
i
will
be
sure
to
grab
them
fresh
salud
o
overall
this
was
great
it
was
an
impulse
buy
without
me
knowing
too
much
about
the
beer
before
i
got
it
though
i
am
a
big
fan
of
goose
island
toured
their
breweries
and
have
had
many
beers
from
them
and
as
such
this
is
ale
is
just
another
number
on
their
great
beers
list
recommended
hands
down
i
think
were
past
the
fresh
stage
but
still
early
on
the
aged
stage
on
this
one
heavy
malts
going
on
mild
spice
seems
very
well
made
but
not
quite
the
best
time
to
approach
this
one
nice
enough
to
drink
i
guess
but
i
will
approach
this
one
fresh
or
heavily
aged
next
time
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
very
little
head
smells
of
chocolate
primarily
with
slight
hoppy
notes
tastes
of
slight
coffee
and
chocolate
with
some
piney
hops
beer
goes
down
smooth
with
its
light
body
good
carbonation
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
the
taste
is
surprisingly
bitter
considering
the
aroma
is
more
sweet
with
creamy
caramel
and
toffee
merging
with
a
moderate
bitter
bite
that
lingers
and
ends
slightly
dry
still
tasty
all
these
months
later
this
is
just
a
peculiar
taste
buttery
and
roasted
grainy
flavor
maybe
the
musty
smell
is
the
tipoff
that
not
all
is
well
distinct
cola
flavor
with
some
earthy
hops
the
carbonation
is
quite
nice
however
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
well
this
is
sort
of
drinkable
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
spoiled
but
the
rest
of
the
bottle
is
going
down
the
sink
taste
is
not
overwhelming
fairly
straight
forward
roasted
malt
aspect
although
the
toffee
flavors
do
add
a
touch
of
complexity
very
soft
carbonation
but
plenty
of
it
nice
and
creamy
serving
type
22
oz
bottle
d
this
was
reminiscent
of
our
special
ale
nice
scent
and
taste
but
nothing
special
the
body
was
only
ok
the
finish
was
smooth
enough
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
seemed
like
it
could
really
improve
with
age
fresh
wasnt
bad
but
fairly
mundane
tasty
stuff
hard
to
put
down
for
long
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
strong
brown
ale
smell
is
first
class
taste
could
be
more
interesting
though
and
more
drawn
together
a
couple
rough
spots
together
it
is
pretty
good
undecided
whether
the
high
abv
works
in
its
favour
or
not
ill
be
interested
to
see
how
subsequent
future
years
stack
up
one
of
the
better
christmas
ales
ive
had
looking
forward
to
next
years
batch
overall
pretty
solid
aba
that
has
aged
well
and
could
be
aged
longer
might
have
to
go
back
to
granite
liquors
in
weymouth
to
buy
a
few
more
definitely
something
different
and
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
learnt
that
this
one
was
a
brown
ale
it
wasnt
as
malty
as
i
was
expecting
and
there
was
more
hops
too
that
and
it
was
sweeter
than
your
usual
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
great
christmas
ale
ill
certainly
hope
for
a
few
more
of
these
before
next
christmas
this
was
the
best
seasonal
in
this
case
a
special
christmas
variety
i
have
ever
had
it
had
a
touch
of
christmas
spices
and
provided
a
very
pleasurable
taste
on
my
pallate
i
had
it
on
tap
and
the
glass
came
with
a
nice
foamy
head
was
served
quite
cold
and
it
required
a
second
glass
to
confirm
the
experience
pours
a
fourfinger
light
tan

that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace

hooksett
nh
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
i
dont
like
it
its
leave
a
nasty
after
taste
in
my
mouth
doesnt
given
look
good
in
a
glass
yes
everybody
loves
it
but
i
dont
i
dont
go
with
the
flow
looks
light
a
light
brown
ale
not
dark
and
it
goes
down
bitter
and
it
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
taste
starts
with
toasted
malt
and
moves
to
licorice
and
fruit
finish
even
has
a
descent
hop
kick
to
it
for
a
brown
i
really
enjoyed
the
different
flavors
of
this
one
bottle
looks
really
classy
bottom
line
at
christmas
time
there
are
some
great
brews
out
there
but
this
isnt
one
of
them
o
i
cant
find
much
about
this
beer
i
really
enjoy
on
a
personal
level
alternatively
there
isnt
much
i
dont
like
from
a
quality
perspective
save
for
the
cheese
on
the
nose
the
undetones
of
fruit
only
seem
welcome
to
me
because
they
add
some
depth
and
uniqueness
to
an
otherwise
earthy
onesided
brown
ale
hops
are
fairly
absent
in
goose
islands
christmas
ale
which
sure
doesnt
invoke
the
christmas
spirit
within
me
this
was
an
interesting
take
on
a
winter
seasonal
the
belgian
qualities
were
undeniable
however
im
not
sure
if
they
were
intentional
it
has
the
characteristics
of
a
christmas
ale
but
maybe
a
bit
too
much
tinkering
with
extra
spices
that
didnt
combine
greatly
glad
this
is
not
an
overly
spiced
holiday
beer
this
us
a
nice
after
dinner
sipper
d
it
is
a
bit
sweet
and
boozy
at
7
3
abv
to
make
a
night
of
it
but
as
an
afterdinner
brew
or
even
one
to
pair
with
a
cigar
its
pretty
complex
versatile
id
reccomend
sipping
on
it
a
bit
closer
to
room
temp
rather
than
treat
it
like
a
winter
quaffing
strong
brown
ale
overall
bought
this
while
back
to
try
i
just
hope
they
still
have
some
of
this
one
in
so
i
can
buy
more
i
had
a
2012
christmas
ale
regarding
the
aroma
the
hops
had
a
dominant
expression
over
the
malt
expected
the
same
happened
in
the
taste
although
the
hop
expression
is
even
more
pronounced
i
noticed
a
caramelized
background
in
the
taste
but
little
of
the
nutty
character
i
would
expect
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
and
i
would
be
pleasured
to
reencounter
it
o
listed
as
a
brown
ale
but
marketed
as
a
christmas
ale
id
prefer
a
bit
more
of
a
spicy
flavor
its
a
complex
flavor
but
a
bit
all
over
the
place
fun
and
festive
one
of
my
favorite
christmas
beers
so
far
the
flavor
is
very
good
with
some
mildly
bitter
hops
up
front
with
hint
of
malt
and
pinelike
element
with
slight
alcohol
with
malt
toastiness
rounding
out
the
simple
ale
this
was
a
very
nice
christmas
ale
in
the
traditional
senseit
seems
like
an
american
brown
with
a
nice
amount
of
hops
very
tasty
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
you
get
a
solid
fingers
worth
of
tan
foam
mostly
miniscule
bubbles
with
an
island
of
larger
ones
at
the
pour
spot
dissipates
a
bit
quicker
than
preferred
the
lacing
is
a
broad
thin
sheet
which
in
turn
clings
very
nicely
the
base
liquid
is
clear
however
there
is
a
huge
amount
of
sediment
floating
about
creating
an
overall
opaque
appearance
red
brick
to
orange
clay
in
color
cant
see
any
bubbles
with
all
that
muck
the
nose
is
rum
cake
to
fruit
cake
baking
spices
sweet
vanilla
and
caramel
surprisingly
boozy
and
alcoholic
has
more
subtly
present
orange
citrus
bread
crust
and
burning
caramelized
brown
sugar
notes
the
fruit
muted
fullbodied
on
the
heavy
side
even
if
generally
creamy
in
texture
just
feels
like
its
running
with
ankle
weights
on
more
dry
than
sweet
the
grittiness
of
the
sediment
an
obvious
factor
in
impeding
flow
the
carbonation
is
mild
but
sufficient
piles
on
the
chocolate
caramel
butterscotch
and
ginger
clove
spice
with
pine
sap
and
orange
citrus
here
the
hops
get
more
assertive
not
that
yeasty
nor
bready
the
fruit
is
kind
of
cherry
to
mixed
berry
the
sort
of
thing
youd
find
in
a
chocolate
and
fruit
dessert
not
as
boozy
as
the
nose
but
you
do
perceive
some
heat
and
imbalance
despite
the
above
its
really
a
pretty
good
brew
three
previous
bottles
consumed
before
this
writeup
were
better
suggesting
earlier
consumption
for
optimal
pleasure
sediment
too
a
concern
owell
balanced
creamy
beer
with
a
nice
varied
flavor
profile
one
of
the
better
christmas
seasonals
that
ive
had
a
change
from
some
of
the
over
spiced
beers
that
come
around
during
the
holidays
goose
islands
christmas
ale
really
hit
the
spot
on
this
cold
december
evening
while
it
seems
that
this
beer
should
be
classified
as
a
winter
warmer
or
perhaps
an
american
red
ale
rather
than
a
brown
ale
it
is
nevertheless
an
impressive
offering
pours
reddish
brown
tons
of
yeast
particles
and
a
foamy
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
foam
atop
the
ale
leaving
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
spicy
cherry
fruity
and
sweet
tastes
have
a
nice
balance
of
spice
cherry
brown
malt
brown
sugar
nice
tartness
different
than
i
remember
from
my
previous
experience
which
actually
prompted
me
to
take
notes
and
review
it
medium
bodied
modest
carbonation
overall
definitely
different
than
i
remember
and
actually
quite
pleasant
im
surprised
that
in
others
reviews
cherry
is
not
mentioned
in
taste
or
aroma
at
7
3
its
warming
and
with
the
spice
makes
a
nice
winter
warmer
o
the
look
at
the
smell
left
more
to
be
desired
but
taste
matters
and
this
one
steps
up
o
i
was
expecting
something
more
like
a
brown
ale
but
this
tastes
more
like
a
winter
warmer
or
a
scottish
ale
its
okay
but
not
something
that
ill
really
seek
out
next
year
great
beer
for
once
a
year
o
this
is
pretty
nice
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
big
cinnamon
and
a
mix
bag
of
spices
in
the
taste
spicy
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
and
it
almost
feels
creamy
a
spice
like
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
cinnamon
spice
in
the
aftertaste
big
spice
and
somewhat
like
eggnog
pleasant
and
enjoyable
o
a
decent
beer
but
not
getting
the
brown
ale
or
the
christmas
part
too
much
in
a
way
they
mistakenly
made
it
better
worth
a
try
but
not
blown
away
beer
has
decent
body
tastes
very
much
like
a
brown
ale
beyond
that
it
doesnt
shine
the
same
as
other
goose
island
brews
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
mahogany
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
malts
spice
some
hops
taste
is
yummy
malts
caramel
a
good
hop
presence
some
spice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
high
quality
beer
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
beer
surprised
me
with
its
complexity
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
will
certainly
be
on
the
lookout
in
years
to
come
o
solid
brew
goose
island
best
parts
of
this
beer
are
probably
the
least
important
factors
taste
is
good
better
than
a
lot
of
christmas
ales
but
this
isnt
the
best
that
said
very
good
beer
o
this
was
unlike
any
other
christmas
ale
ive
had
it
is
definitely
the
worst
as
it
holds
no
flavors
or
characteristics
ive
come
to
expect
out
of
a
christmas
ale
it
was
quite
sour
and
skunky
i
would
not
recommend
or
buy
again
overall
great
brew
there
are
plenty
of
winter
seasonals
to
get
your
hands
on
but
this
one
is
a
goto
for
me
this
is
a
bit
overpriced
for
a
fourpack
in
my
area
but
it
is
well
worth
the
extra
cash
for
a
seasonal
treat
like
this
d
definitely
gets
better
as
it
warms
i
took
it
out
of
the
fridge
and
let
it
sit
for
20
mins
wish
i
had
waited
longer
some
holiday
spice
but
nothing
overwhelming
on
any
front
listed
as
an
american
brown
im
surprised
this
wasnt
fermented
with
a
belgian
yeast
strand
from
all
the
dark
fruitysweet
flavors
and
aromas
i
am
detecting
this
is
a
great
holiday
seasonal
and
worth
picking
up
a
4
pack
this
beer
is
a
reddish
cloudy
brew
it
sports
an
enormous
offwhite
head
with
lots
of
fine
lace
the
aroma
is
of
yeast
and
malt
there
is
a
hint
of
alcohol
but
its
not
distracting
some
spice
and
wood
in
the
smell
but
theyre
distant
and
faint
the
taste
is
flavorful
and
strong
warming
comes
out
here
along
with
some
great
malt
toast
and
bread
flavors
the
beer
is
full
and
flavorful
great
body
and
lingering
malt
finish
nice
brew
o
enjoyed
this
christmas
offering
quite
a
bit
and
id
say
its
right
up
there
with
great
lakes
christmas
ale
on
a
side
note
i
got
to
say
that
doing
beer
reviews
with
this
iphone
is
so
much
more
efficient
kind
of
kicking
myself
for
holding
out
on
this
purchase
oh
well
glad
to
recommend
this
beer
merry
christmas
everyone
o
overall
pretty
good
fruity
with
a
christmas
cheer
of
alcohol
and
fruitiness
found
this
to
be
more
bock
like
then
a
brown
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
brew
but
if
you
took
off
the
christmas
label
it
is
just
a
brown
ale
with
a
bit
more
focus
on
some
bitterness
and
orangelike
zest
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
either
i
prefer
this
over
2011
everything
the
taste
the
nose
the
strength
quaffability
and
the
finish
has
been
notched
up
a
bit
this
is
an
exceptional
christmas
ale
give
this
one
a
try
it
will
be
my
christmas
ale
of
choice
from
now
on
i
am
very
impressed
overall
i
like
the
change
of
pace
from
the
typical
overly
spiced
christmas
ales
out
there
and
the
piney
hops
still
give
it
a
nice
winterholiday
feel
it
certainly
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
a
solid
beer

o
excellent
christmas
ale
great
aromas
and
flavor
m
medium
to
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
well
done
but
not
crazy
about
the
style
probably
wont
get
this
again
o
i
wish
i
had
sat
on
this
a
little
bit
longer
to
see
how
it
developed
overall
i
find
it
to
be
pretty
boring
while
not
bad
by
any
means
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
again
given
the
chance
m
medium
bodied
drinks
easily
and
i
could
go
either
way
with
it
i
had
this
ontap
at
thunder
bay
grille
in
rockford
il
in
december
2012
this
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
scent
is
sweet
with
malts
with
hints
of
nuts
the
taste
is
toasted
filled
with
lots
of
good
spice
flavor
and
nuts
has
a
great
texture
and
flavor
making
it
a
great
allaround
beer
a
very
satisfying
winter
brown
ale
full
bodied
but
not
too
thick
or
syrupy
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
very
enjoyable
flavors
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
this
felt
more
of
a
crossover
style
between
the
typical
winter
warmer
and
brown
ale
which
was
pretty
refreshing
the
spice
was
slightly
muted
but
still
delivered
another
level
of
flavor
to
the
beer
o
i
feel
very
meh
about
this
beer
its
decent
but
theres
nothing
about
it
that
really
stands
out
either
in
terms
of
flavor
or
aroma
and
theres
nothing
about
it
that
says
holiday
or
christmas
its
just
a
decent
brown
ale
a
decent
brown
ale
i
would
recommend
this
for
newcomers
to
craft
beer
this
was
a
very
nice
brown
ale
full
of
rich
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
this
felt
a
lot
stronger
than
the
actual
alcoholic
content
would
imply
because
its
so
complex
and
not
as
easygoing
as
most
other
brown
ales
that
ive
had
this
didnt
rate
as
highly
as
i
would
have
liked
if
youre
tired
of
holiday
beers
that
resemble
wassails
or
are
too
spicy
this
would
be
a
good
alternative
even
if
this
was
deceptively
complex
for
the
implied
style
oi
do
not
enjoy
this
beer
its
like
a
weirdly
aged
spoiled
apa
im
not
sure
what
it
was
set
out
to
be
but
im
guessing
it
failed
theres
really
nothing
else
to
say
the
only
reason
id
ever
suggest
this
to
someone
is
to
see
if
i
got
a
spoiled
bottle
or
something
do
the
breadyspicy
yeast
strain
here
gives
it
some
staying
power
and
makes
it
unique
compared
to
many
other
classic
overspiced
american
christmas
ales
on
the
market
but
by
the
time
i
finish
this
i
wont
be
itching
to
crack
another
one
tonight
o
this
brew
came
highly
acclaimed
and
i
have
to
say
im
a
wee
bit
dissapointed
overall
very
solid
just
didnt
blow
me
away
i
will
definitely
try
again
as
i
actually
have
last
years
version
in
the
basement
o
interesting
flavors
but
a
bit
unbalanced
the
bitterness
tastes
green
throughout
and
does
not
mesh
well
with
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
some
tasty
bread
caramel
notes
are
present
2012
vintage
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
opaque
amber
brown
coloring
with
some
unfiltered
suspensions
throughout
sparse
filmy
white
surface
coating
with
a
slightly
thicker
ring
around
the
glass
aromas
of
nut
sweetness
tangy
caramel
sugary
sweetness
old
world
fruits
and
a
floral
hops
presence
pretty
unique
nose
and
well
blended
as
it
was
hard
to
tease
out
specifics
flavors
are
a
solid
lead
punch
of
old
world
fruits
including
date
and
fig
with
a
subtle
ribbon
of
tart
fruit
sweetness
as
well
as
tangy
caramel
and
rich
hazelnut
very
strong
deep
big
sweet
flavors
on
the
palate
cloying
is
just
cut
short
by
an
overpowered
bitter
hops
profile
but
that
too
is
eventually
overpowered
the
sweet
earthy
tones
begin
to
overrun
your
taste
buds
dark
cherry
and
oak
characteristics
come
into
the
aftertaste
giving
this
a
winelike
feel
at
the
end
of
the
drink
especially
as
you
continue
to
drink
and
characteristics
build
rich
robust
flavors
on
a
midbodied
brew
lead
to
a
rich
slightly
cloying
finish
interesting
big
brew
and
great
for
the
cold
weather
but
this
one
has
a
lot
going
on
o
not
as
dark
as
some
other
winter
styles
this
is
a
nice
switch
up
from
the
standard
big
winter
warmer
pretty
much
a
solid
amber
ale
with
some
christmas
style
spices
would
purchase
again
overall
this
is
the
most
unique
christmas
ale
ive
had
in
2012
it
really
does
taste
like
a
christmas
dessert
the
bottle
says
its
7
2
abv
which
is
in
conflict
with
this
page
perhaps
they
change
the
abv
each
year
but
even
at
7
2
it
goes
down
very
easy
im
honestly
surprised
i
like
this
as
much
as
i
do
i
might
have
to
buy
more
odit
has
a
bunch
of
what
youll
find
in
most
winterchristmas
ales
but
it
also
has
just
as
many
aspects
that
are
unique
it
is
definitely
my
kind
of
holiday
brew
i
love
how
it
sticks
to
its
brown
ale
skeleton
i
like
this
a
lot
i
could
definitely
see
myself
battling
over
whether
to
buy
this
or
sierra
nevada
celebration
the
next
time
i
am
in
the
holiday
spirit
overall
a
nicely
balanced
christmas
beer
a
tad
much
on
the
sweet
and
nutty
side
for
me
overall
it
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
other
than
a
rather
odd
spicy
aftertaste
that
the
brew
leaves
on
the
tongue
all
other
aspects
of
the
beer
are
very
nice
it
is
worth
a
try
o
certainly
an
interesting
take
on
a
brown
ale
the
spices
are
nice
but
it
seems
like
something
is
off
with
them
a
nice
switch
up
from
the
usual
winter
warmer
though
d
very
quaffable
quite
enjoyable
a
very
nice
rather
unheralded
winter
seasonal
from
goose
island
this
one
will
easily
be
in
the
annual
rotation
going
forward
heck
i
may
even
invest
in
another
four
pack
yet
this
year
pours
a
hazy
chestnutbrown
color
a
tan
head
leaves
just
a
trace
of
lacing
the
nose
is
predominantly
malty
some
nuttiness
atop
a
bed
of
caramel
some
slight
spice
notes
maybe
cinnamon
andor
nutmeg
its
faint
which
is
fine
by
me
as
im
not
into
spiced
ales
all
that
much
on
the
palate
this
follows
the
nose
somewhat
closely
rich
and
malty
bitterness
subdued
but
present
enough
to
lend
balance
subtle
spice
notes
that
are
hard
to
describe
but
definitely
take
the
flavor
in
a
different
direction
than
a
pure
american
brown
mouthfeel
features
a
soft
carbonation
akin
to
a
good
stout
and
it
works
well
here
too
all
in
all
this
hits
all
the
right
marks
but
it
just
doesnt
wow
me
o
a
nice
beer
would
like
to
give
it
another
go
in
the
future
overall
the
swampy
peat
taste
possible
brown
malt
and
hops
clash
and
very
little
sweet
malts
make
me
reconsider
a
second
glass
hell
if
you
enjoy
it
though
drink
up
a
pretty
decent
and
flavorful
ale
good
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
nice
body
all
around
highly
drinkable
would
have
it
again
pours
a
slightly
hazy
deep
auburn
color
with
a
huge
khaki
head
that
persists
for
a
while
leaving
minimal
lace
on
the
way
down
the
glass
wonderful
aroma
of
dark
fruits
like
plums
dark
cherries
prunes
and
raisins
lots
of
caramel
and
dark
sugar
aroma
as
well
as
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
citrus
and
spicy
hop
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
lots
of
dark
sugars
and
melanoidins
light
fruit
flavors
mixed
with
a
bit
of
hay
and
im
getting
chestnuts
as
well
light
spicy
citrus
bite
and
a
touch
of
ethanol
keeps
everything
on
balance
medium
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
its
an
interesting
fusion
of
styles
i
find
it
like
a
dopplebock
meets
a
belgian
strong
dark
only
lighter
in
body
and
add
some
hops
o
never
had
this
beer
fresh
and
i
probably
never
will
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
winter
seasonals
ive
had
and
its
probably
because
of
the
age
i
may
let
the
other
6
age
for
another
year
than
this
will
really
turn
out
how
i
want

with

so
of

leafy

lesser

more
of

fairly
nutty
some
drying

bitterness
and
very
light
notes
of
spice
almost
not
worth
mentioning
medium

nothing
amazing
going
on
but
a
decent
drinker
overall
first
year
enjoying
this
and
thats
exactly
what
im
doing

bottled

into
a
13
oz
tulip
confused
as
to
this
being
called
a
brown
ale
seems
more
like
a
old
ale
to
me
pours
a
deep
mahogany
lots
of
floaties
and
a
nice
really
off
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lace
smell
is
carmel
nutmeg
toffee
and
bready
taste
is
much
stronger
very
little
nutmeg
with
loads
of
carmel
and
toffee
and
some
dark
fruit
this
is
going
to
be
a
staple
this
holiday
season
body
is
on
the
larger
side
plenty
of
life
not
dry
and
really
drinkable
this
beer
is
really
special
drinks
much
bigger
than
its
abv
and
it
is
really
more
complex
than
its
size
would
have
expect
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
citrus
zest
and
a
slightly
funky
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
with
each
sip
but
there
is
no
funk
that
comes
across
in
the
flavor
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
seems
to
be
show
some
age
at
this
point
i
enjoy
this
and
will
purchase
more
i
am
going
to
put
2
away
for
a
year
and
try
them
again
next
fall
they
say
they
age
well
for
up
to
5
years
the
malts
are
sugary
sweet
and
candylike
there
is
some
slight
booze
apparent
which
is
disappointing
at
only
7
3
this
is
a
little
too
hoppy
for
the
style
although
i
understand
that
this
is
probably
what
they
were
going
for
this
year
chill
out
with
the
hops
america
not
bad
but
i
expected
more
from
goose
island
overall
this
is
my
very
first
christmas
ale
and
i
am
quite
pleased
with
it
this
is
not
overly
sweet
by
any
means
and
has
a
nice
transition
with
a
dry
and
lightly
bitter
finish
begging
the
next
sip
im
intrigued
by
the
tea
flavor
but
find
it
very
familiar
and
enjoyable
check
this
one
out
i
found
this
at
my
local
walmart
overall
a
christmas
ale
i
look
forward
to
every
year
has
an
interesting
flavor
this
year
which
is
certainly
suitable
for
the
season
bought
a
vintage
bottle
from
2008
while
at
the
brewpub
in
chicago
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
muddy
brown
color
with
a
pretty
good
looking
head
on
top
some
retention
with
a
touch
of
lacing
also
the
smell
of
the
beer
reminded
me
more
of
a
barley
wine
i
never
would
had
said
this
was
a
brown
ale
the
smell
is
sweet
lots
of
caramel
maple
and
very
malty
no
hops
aroma
just
very
soft
and
malty
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
almost
fruity
with
some
spice
and
brown
sugar
this
tastes
nothing
like
a
brown
ale
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
creamy
warming
and
mellow
overall
very
impressive
beer
really
glad
i
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
very
good
beer
all
around
definitely
came
out
way
to
early
with
this
bottled
in
september
but
it
should
pair
rather
well
with
the
winter
months
if
anyone
knows
that
this
is
a
totally
christmas
ale
this
year
please
let
me
know
so
i
can
post
my
review
in
the
appropriate
place
the
bottle
i
have
looks
exactly
like
the
artwork
in
the
picture
for
this
beer
but
is
a
flat
red
color
and
says
2012
on
it
it
also
read
7
3
abv
and
not
6

came
in
a
4
pack
not
a
6
12
ounce
bottle
into

bottled
on

pours
very
cloudy
reddish

color
with
a
nice

finger
fairly
dense
khaki
head
with
nice
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
slight
spotty
lacing
on
the

lingering
notes
of

hidden
with
almost
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
holiday
brown
ale
well
balanced
and
fairly
robust
and
very
smooth
to
drink
very
enjoyable
overallcomments
excellent
this
offering
takes
you
on
a
winter
journey
combining
a
complex
aroma
and
flavor
profile
into
a
fine
well
crafted
very
enjoyable
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
classified
as
an
american
brown
ale
at
6
2
abv
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
beer
there
are
some
nice
notes
on
the
nose
palate
but
overall
it
is
a
bit
watery
and
lacking
something
glad
i
tried
it
but
lots
of
other
things
i
would
rather
drink
during
the
holiday
season
overall
an
enjoyable
easy
drinking
quaff
thats
sure
to
satiate
during
the
chilly
holiday
season
id
like
to
try
this
one
fresh
but
i
gotta
say
this
3
year
old
bottle
appears
to
have
aged
great
overall
more
bitter
than
anticipated
the
spice
character
is
somewhat
boring
for
a
christmas
ale
but
the
hop
character
is
not
satisfying
enough
for
an
american
brown
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
mediumlow
carbonation
beer
foams
beer
up
slightly
on
palate
but
not
completely
resulting
mouthfeel
is
smooth
slightly
creamy
generally
fairly
easy
to
drink
finish
is
expectedly
dry
from
some
residual
malt
sugars
and
hop
usage
slightly
sticky
around
edges
of
mouth
smelling
this
beer
which
i
let
warm
from
fridge
temp
for
a
12
hour
reveals
potent
yeast
sweetness
and
spice
its
not
nearly
as
spicy
as
sugar
plumb
ccb
but
is
definitely
christmasy
and
aromatic
drinking
this
beer
leaves
the
impression
of
having
just
taken
a
large
bite
of
some
bread
pudding
with
the
same
heavy
spiciness
and
yeast
breadiness
found
in
the
nose
its
definitely
an
excellent
winter
beer
but
can
easily
be
enjoyed
in
the
summer
as
i
have
chosen
to
do
the
mouthfeel
is
spectacular
with
a
mediumfull
body
chewy
texture
and
effervescent
spiciness
its
a
highly
drinkable
beer
worth
the
price
and
definitely
worth
trying
an
exceptional
brown
which
is
to
say
a
very
fine
beer
in
a
normally
lackluster
style
recommended
o
this
is
a
great
american
brown
ale
its
one
of
the
very
few
beers
of
this
style
that
successfully
manages
to
integrate
piney
citrusy
american
hop
notes
with
a
classic
englishstyle
bready
malt
base
very
well
done
o
overall
not
as
warming
or
filling
as
id
want
a
winter
ale
to
be
not
as
brown
either
but
a
spicy
and
fun
ale
forgettable
overall
these
seasonals
are
always
interesting
will
pick
one
up
again
next
year
overallthis
is
what
i
would
expect
from
any
beer
that
puts
christmas
on
the
label
spicier
than
a
typical
winter
beer
nice
complexity
i
would
gravitate
towards
this
in
the
dead
of
winter
solid
offering
overall
its
a
average
beer
im
a
huge
fan
of
gi
but
the
yeastybread
character
throws
off
the
other
aspects
of
the
beer
for
me
its
not
that
appealing
2011
made
me
wonder
while
drinking
it
if
it
was
supposed
to
be
some
kind
of
redbrown
hybrid
apparently
not
anyway
its
unimpressive
but
not
bad
overall
its
nice
overall
much
better
or
at
least
more
interesting
than
i
remembered
glad
i
gave
this
another
shot
o
this
isnt
bad
at
all
but
at
124
pack
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
impressed
not
exactly
a
nut
brown
ale
though
it
has
nutty
aspects
not
exactly
a
winter
warmer
though
it
has
a
bit
of
holiday
spices
it
works
though
overall
impression
a
greatly
malted
brown
ale
that
was
pleasant
but
wouldnt
go
to
a
goose
island
christmas
ale
tasting
for
it
they
have
many
other
beers
worth
visiting
time
and
time
again
i
will
stick
to
these
go
for
it
if
you
have
the
chance
but
nothing
big
o
good
brown
ale
that
isnt
as
invasive
as
a
lot
of
holiday
spiced
brews
ive
never
aged
a
american
brown
before
but
i
think
i
might
age
the
other
half
of
these
since
they
encourage
it
seems
like
things
might
get
interesting
after
a
year
or
two
oi
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
the
spices
were
not
there
however
the
malt
was
great
the
unlisted
alcohol
presence
is
detectable
and
this
is
as
strong
of
an
american
brown
ale
as
ive
ever
had
a
tasty
sipper
and
a
very
impressive
brew
now
i
wish
i
had
another
o
such
a
nice
winter
brown
so
glad
its
back
this
yeari
just
wish
now
that
it
would
snow
and
start
acting
like
winter
12oz
bottle
deep
copper
colored
brew
mostly
clear
aromas
of
nutty
malts
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
like
spice
in
the
taste
earthy
with
some
raw
ginger
nutmeg
and
toffee
tea
like
hop
flavor
very
mild
and
herbal
nutty
toasted
malt
flavor
is
the
main
player
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
nice
spiced
brown
ale
very
english
in
style
a
nice
brown
ale
good
flavor
and
nice
feel
o
there
isnt
anything
that
scream
winter
or
christmas
for
this
beer
as
the
spice
was
barely
noticeable
even
as
it
warmed
up
a
good
brown
ale
nonetheless
do
havent
had
this
one
in
a
couple
years
i
dont
remember
it
being
this
hoppy
just
an
nice
easy
drinking
brown
tastes
good
no
inyourface
flavors
value
alert
not
worth
buying
a
4pack
for
1112
a
class
act
especially
for
a
beer
of
this
age
one
is
left
with
the
impression
that
the
hops
have
faded
away
leaving
a
dominance
of
sweet
malt
flavours
sort
of
a
barleywine
lite
the
aroma
is
magnificent
although
the
flavour
is
a
bit
too
sweet
and
syrupy
lovely
mouthfeel
a
decent
christmas
brew
that
trumps
quite
a
few
ive
tried
this
season
o
i
liked
the
beer
but
not
extra
special
this
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
its
malty
mild
and
a
bit
spicy
unfortunately
i
think
its
a
horrible
value
there
are
brown
ales
just
as
malty
and
mild
as
this
one
that
wont
cost
you
as
much
i
liked
it
but
it
did
not
blow
me
away
overall
this
beer
is
exceptionally
tasty
and
unique
with
its
savory
qualities
it
is
not
your
typical
christmas
beer
nor
is
it
your
typical
beer
of
any
type
but
it
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
at
any
time
of
year
o
a
good
christmas
brown
ale
but
not
sure
i
would
go
back
to
this
one
too
often
o
a
very
nice
brown
ale
that
does
well
as
a
winter
warmer
this
is
one
that
ill
come
back
to
overall
a
very
solid
brown
ale
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
very
solid
beer
while
the
consistency
and
carbonation
are
ok
the
fact
that
my
tongue
recoils
when
i
take
a
sip
is
the
leading
component
of
the
feel
of
gi
christmas
ale
just
not
a
good
beer
overall
there
are
plenty
of
other
seasonal
offerings
that
blow
this
out
of
the
water
so
i
wont
lose
sleep
never
giving
this
a
second
look
again
o
overall
a
great
winter
ale
that
celebrates
the
holidays
and
taste
is
really
good
and
glad
to
finally
pop
my
bottle
from
2009
overall
not
bad
expected
a
bit
more
spices
flavor
improved
the
warmer
the
beer
got
recommend
letting
it
sit
out
for
a
bit
before
drinking
taste
has
a
really
nice
creamy
feel
to
it
with
a
vanillanutty
maltyeast
interplay
reminds
me
alot
of
av
winter
solstice
love
that
beer
so
this
one
is
right
up
my
alley
rarely
do
i
find
myself
lamenting
the
split
of
a
22
oz
bomber
but
in
this
case
i
found
the
bottom
of
my
snifter
rather
depressing
delicioso
age
has
been
kind
to
this
one
yes
yes
o
pretty
sweet
and
average
m
light
bodied
easy
drinking
light
carbonation
sweet
finish
o
a
nice
brew
but
too
pricey
to
justify
drinking
alot
of
this
one
o
for
as
much
as
i
have
heard
about
this
i
have
to
say
pretty
disappointed
by
the
bland
nature
of
this
beer
nothing
too
special
here
so
i
am
hoping
that
some
time
in
the
bottle
may
help
although
i
was
disappointed
this
is
a
really
good
beer
still
just
nothing
special
will
definately
get
again
for
more
of
the
novelty
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
good
american
brown
ale
and
so
far
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
goose
island
it
had
a
nice
malt
profile
it
wasnt
overly
spicy
and
it
had
a
nice
amount
of
hops
it
tastes
like
a
mix
of
a
hoppy
american
brown
ale
and
a
winter
warmer
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
i
could
probably
go
for
another
one
but
after
that
i
think
the
sweetness
would
get
to
me
it
also
goes
pretty
well
with
a
meal
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
way
its
look
and
its
complexity
in
the
aroma
and
taste
they
were
a
lot
of
balanced
flavors
going
on
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
the
higher
amount
of
sweetness
and
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
both
would
be
pretty
good
if
they
were
turned
down
a
little
bit
i
would
get
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
good
holiday
ale
it
is
a
little
different
from
your
normal
holiday
winter
warmer
and
i
like
that
i
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
average
holiday
ale
this
was
a
good
attempt
at
a
drinkable
beer
for
the
holidays
and
it
has
a
good
mixture
of
flavors
and
aromas
that
suit
the
season
well
goose
island
manages
to
impress
me
a
little
with
this
beer
o
a
delicious
brew
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
o
not
too
bad
somewhat
thin
for
a
brown
ale
and
decent
flavor
o
a
damn
good
beer
i
have
no
complaints
about
it
whatsoever
but
its
not
a
have
to
have
beer
thanks
to
crass3000
for
this
one
starting
off
my
12
beers
of
christmas
with
this
one
it
pours
a
clear
russetgarnetamber
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
dark
greens
black
pepper
very
light
hard
water
and
light
rye
bread
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
more
black
pepper
some
mandarin
orange
and
a
pinch
of
nutmeg
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
brown
ale
something
easygoing
enough
for
the
beginning
of
the
cold
winter
months
around
here
o
good
stuff
a
nice
brown
ale
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
pairs
with
a
roast
pork
dinner
i
remember
being
able
to
get
this
in
six
packs
years
ago
one
of
those
that
i
cut
my
craft
beer
teeth
on
and
was
very
excited
to
see
this
available
again
after
so
many
years
it
might
have
lost
some
of
its
luster
but
hard
to
tell
regardless
it
is
still
very
enjoyable
and
great
for
the
holidays
o
not
bad
at
all
some
of
the
aromas
dont
quite
mesh
and
it
almost
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
plus
an
overspiced
and
fruity
winter
warmer
but
it
mostly
works
that
strange
sawdust
aromaflavor
overpowers
a
little
bit
as
it
warms
up
hockey
teammate
brought
a
couple
four
packs
of
goose
island
xmas
ale
to
our
recent
game
and
it
was
pretty
tasty
the
beer
poured
a
dark
copper
a
lighter
shade
of
mahogany
perhaps
finger
and
change
of
offwhite
head
having
modest
retention
and
some
lacing
nose
has
toffee
fruity
malts
some
dark
berry
notes
and
some
distinct
milk
chocolate
hint
og
some
spicing
as
well
taste
has
an
interplay
of
rich
toffee
and
carmel
more
milk
and
dark
chocolates
finishes
with
a
bit
more
spice
and
roasty
character
yet
remains
fairly
sweet
throughout
each
sip
low
carbonation
with
a
medium
full
feel
being
fairly
creamy
at
times
good
drinkability
a
nice
brown
ale
with
light
spicing
this
has
aged
moderately
well
id
think
overall
this
is
really
pretty
tasty
lots
of
really
nice
toasty
brown
malt
notes
and
really
nice
englishtype
hop
flavorsaromas
even
if
theyre
way
stronger
than
they
would
be
in
a
traditonal
english
brown
that
being
said
its
11
99
for
a
4pk
would
i
pay
it
again
meh
probably
not
overall
id
probably
give
this
a
b
but
with
the
price
i
gotta
knock
it
down
to
a
b
overall
nice
brown
ale
hints
of
spices
nice
brown
malts
caramel
toffee
molasses
brown
sugar
and
even
a
nice
hop
kick
the
only
issue
is
the
hint
of
tannic
flavor
from
the
hint
of
darker
roast
and
slight
astringent
hop
o
overall
just
a
little
lackluster
for
a
14
dollar
4
pack
o
a
solid
and
enjoyable
brown
ale
that
i
would
go
back
for
again
and
again
supereasy
to
drink
sweet
but
not
overly
so
just
spoton
recommend
not
a
big
beer
that
you
would
think
to
sit
on
but
time
has
been
kind
to
this
one
very
pleasant
flavors
warm
and
well
integrated
very
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
sitting
around
this
beer
tastes
like
christmas
dessert
its
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
really
come
out
as
the
beer
warms
an
american
brown
ale
strutting
around
like
a
winter
warmer
you
have
to
let
this
one
get
to
celler
temp
as
it
becomes
a
real
treat
heres
to
a
long
winter
so
i
can
go
through
all
of
the
seasoanls
i
have
goose
island
was
a
great
way
to
kick
it
off
o
my
1st
goose
beer
was
pretty
much
a
let
down
if
you
like
your
brown
ales
on
the
sweet
side
i
would
suggest
it
but
i
really
like
them
more
roasty
ok
unique
malty
and
dried
fruit
flavor
nice
beer
goose
island
specialty
beers
never
disappoint
edit
and
i
would
never
guess
this
beer
is
only
5
6
abv
seems
a
tad
stronger
a
good
but
not
awesome
christmas
offering
i
could
have
a
few
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
a
nice
tasting
christmas
ale
far
from
a
standard
brown
ale
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
holiday
ale
while
looking
at
it
in
my
glass
i
feel
it
would
be
a
most
welcome
addition
to
a
holiday
turkey
or
ham
for
that
matter
quite
delicious
brown
ale
says
it
will
develop
for
up
to
5
years
will
be
interested
to
see
how
that
goes
a
nice
simple
beer
to
drink
on
a
winter
night
will
probably
enjoy
once
or
twice
a
year
o
a
tasty
beer
for
the
season
happy
holidays
this
is
one
of
the
cleanest
most
welldesigned
christmas
beer
labels
ive
seen
this
season
beautiful
design
o
a
decent
beer
easy
drinkin
but
it
just
fels
like
its
missing
something
o
enjoyable
but
a
bit
simplisticsweet
ive
heard
this
ages
well
and
will
be
curious
to
follow
it
over
time
m
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
even
for
being
a
5
6
beer
i
get
a
little
alcohol
warmth
o
goose
island
doesnt
always
go
with
the
grain
for
their
seasonals
this
christmas
ale
being
one
of
them
a
brown
in
the
dead
of
winter
ok
as
i
like
changing
it
up
this
is
by
no
means
an
amazing
brown
but
its
passable
and
certainly
quaffable
review
2012
bottling
not
as
big
a
fan
seemed
a
little
less
warm
a
little
less
rich
had
a
less
refined
character
and
a
higher
abv
7
4
o
i
feel
like
my
breath
stinks
now
review
is
for
the
2011
bottling
o
meh
kind
of
a
disapointment
maybe
the
brewer
was
shooting
to
high
but
it
didnt
get
there
not
particularly
thick
but
then
again
its
6
abv
so
the
malt
bill
isnt
too
substantial
very
nice
overall
the
4pack
disappeared
quickly
delicious
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
very
pleased
to
see
this
offering
in
2011
goose
island
did
not
produce
this
brew
in
2010
in
a
four
pack
pours
cloudy
brown
with
a
rich
off
white
head
that
laces
to
the
glass
quite
well
aroma
of
bready
malts
hints
of
holiday
spice
a
bit
of
caramel
taste
is
fantastically
smooth
for
the
style
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
with
a
nie
lingering
taste
in
the
back
of
my
gums
towards
the
throat
the
caramel
malt
and
spices
blend
well
together
a
touch
of
quality
hops
are
detected
a
touch
of
ale
yeast
balanced
very
well
and
one
of
my
favorite
christmas
brown
ales
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
interesting
take
on
the
christmas
seasonal
i
dare
say
it
may
be
teabagged
with
cherry
wood
and
its
kinda
cool
that
they
change
the
recipe
up
a
little
every
year
they
also
say
it
ages
well
hmm
cheers
just
picked
up
four
bottles
at
the
store
and
was
frankly
unimpressed
it
looks
and
tastes
like
a
fairly
standard
brown
alesweet
caramel
malt
notes
of
chocolate
just
a
hint
of
spice
some
bitter
pine
hoppiness
on
the
finish
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
on
the
watery
side
which
drags
it
down
overalli
really
want
winter
warmers
to
be
warming
you
know
notes
curious
about
the
marketingbranding
of
this
release
supposedly
it
was
not
going
to
be
bottled
anymore
stake
by
the
macros
in
gi
and
now
it
comes
in
very
limitedexclusive
quantities
and
sure
it
is
nice
but
im
not
sure
it
is
a
brew
that
can
hold
any
type
of
hype
o
a
good
american
style
brown
ale
well
balanced
with
enough
hops
in
there
to
satisfy
cuts
through
the
malt
and
rounds
out
the
flavors
very
well
smooth
caramelly
malt
gives
a
really
nice
base
for
this
one
not
exactly
sure
whywhat
makes
this
a
christmas
seasonal
but
it
is
pretty
tasty
not
sure
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
again
but
for
a
shot
in
the
dark
4pk
purchase
im
not
disappointed
at
all
overall
this
a
good
brown
but
the
spiciness
is
not
countered
enough
by
brown
ale
nuttiness
and
maltiness
the
mouth
feel
needs
a
little
tweaking
in
the
end
i
would
have
it
again
and
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
drinkability
it
is
a
very
solid
holiday
beer
it
offers
both
the
malts
the
season
has
me
craving
and
the
spicy
edge
i
want
from
holiday
releases
without
overemphasizing
either
overall
kind
of
does
remind
me
of
a
spicy
warmer
but
not
really
brown
ale
huh
nice
take
on
one
ill
have
another
no
complaints
whatsoever
poured
a
darker
amber
that
has
a
copperish
twinge
to
it
small
cream
colored
head
that
dispersed
to
a
slight
layer
of
froath
around
the
glass
the
smells
are
not
very
robust
with
hints
of
caramel
roast
nuts
and
malt
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
complexity
the
taste
is
high
maltiness
any
taste
fleets
quickly
leaving
not
much
aftertaste
perhaps
this
one
can
use
a
year
or
two
cellared
to
develop
its
flavors
new
packaging
and
a
higher
abv
6
2
are
some
changes
from
past
releases
o
everything
a
christmas
ale
should
be
i
really
like
browns
and
this
is
a
great
one
no
matter
what
time
of
year
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
would
be
easy
to
tip
back
a
few
of
these
not
sure
how
or
why
this
is
a
christmas
beer
its
just
a
well
crafted
brown
ale
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
ones
ive
had
in
a
while
actually
just
dont
expect
to
be
wowed
it
looked
nice
but
not
really
a
typical
brown
ale
color
i
was
not
picking
up
anything
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
not
bad
just
not
really
anything
it
says
it
can
cellar
for
five
years
interesting
at
abv
6
2
so
three
more
are
waiting
in
the
cellar
for
the
next
few
years
hopefully
it
gets
better
o
well
i
took
a
4
year
hiatus
from
this
brew
and
never
really
appreciated
it
for
what
it
was
at
the
time
now
that
it
has
gone
through
numerous
format
changes
i
couldnt
resist
picking
up
the
4
pack
the
new
label
art
looks
really
nice
and
the
beer
is
quite
tasty
o
i
like
this
on
the
whole
but
there
are
more
exciting
holiday
brews
for
sure
im
interested
to
cellar
a
bottle
or
two
i
suspect
it
would
turn
out
pretty
nicely
if
the
spices
are
given
time
to
mellow
o
a
nice
christmas
ale
that
is
very
different
from
a
lot
of
the
winter
warmers
very
drinkable
o
man
i
dug
this
one
ive
seen
this
one
in
stores
quite
a
bit
whenever
i
go
back
to
the
midwest
but
have
never
taken
the
plunge
until
now
im
glad
i
did
poured
a
dark
copper
a
lighter
shade
of
mahogany
perhaps
finger
and
change
of
offwhite
head
having
modest
retention
and
some
lacing
nose
has
toffee
fruity
malts
some
dark
berry
notes
and
some
distinct
milk
chocolate
hint
og
some
spicing
as
well
taste
has
an
interplay
of
rich
toffee
and
carmel
more
milk
and
dark
chocolates
finishes
with
a
bit
more
spice
and
roasty
character
yet
remains
fairly
sweet
throughout
each
sip
low
carbonation
with
a
medium
full
feel
being
fairly
creamy
at
times
good
drinkability
a
nice
brown
ale
with
light
spicing
this
has
aged
moderately
well
id
think
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
if
your
looking
for
the
perfect
holiday
ale
to
compliment
your
fruit
cake
this
might
be
it
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
perfect
for
the
oncoming
holiday
season
a
zangy
brown
ale
littered
with
spice
mediumbodied
with
average
carbonation
this
was
my
first
vintage
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
im
already
looking
forward
to
seeing
their
2011
version
o
i
love
when
people
say
that
a
beer
has
to
be
over
a
certain
abv
to
age
well
i
call
bs
one
of
the
best
brews
i
ever
had
was
a
6yr
old
sa
2004
chocolate
bock
at
5
5
this
is
a
brew
that
stands
up
fantastic
as
well
this
beer
is
so
well
done
that
i
wish
it
was
an
everyday
brew
ive
had
this
bottle
cellering
since
early
2010
and
just
found
a
great
stash
of
it
last
week
i
think
ill
grab
a
bunch
more
overall
a
really
good
beer
which
surprised
me
as
i
normally
am
not
a
fan
of
brown
ales
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
and
will
definitely
buy
it
in
the
future
taste
enjoyable
more
to
the
flavor
profile
than
the
appearance
or
style
label
would
have
led
on
even
though
brown
caramel
and
toffee
all
over
it
maybe
brown
sugar
pronounced
sweetness
without
being
a
turnoff
highly
carbonated
pulls
out
some
pine
flavor
without
really
having
any
hop
assertiveness
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
i
shall
look
for
it
again
near
christmas
you
may
want
to
do
the
same
o
a
solid
brown
ale
very
light
and
a
decent
after
dinner
drink
overall
relatively
decent
offering
fun
to
try
but
only
once
dvery
rich
although
highly
drinkable
as
well
this
one
held
up
pretty
well
with
some
considerable
aging
despite
its
low
abv
d
very
tasty
and
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
a
bomber
the
perfect
after
dinner
treat
really
nice
stuff
overall
appropriately
christmasy
but
a
damn
good
brew
regardless
of
season
overall
a
generally
pleasant
and
flavorful
christmas
ale
i
would
be
curious
to
compare
this
to
a
bottle
of
2009
christmas
from
last
year
my
guess
is
that
it
has
mellowed
out
since
then
a
nice
beer
for
a
freezing
cold
chicago
night
like
tonight
notwithstanding
the
feel
a
wonderful
festive
beer
beautifully
complex
and
the
flavours
are
just
lovely
and
balanced
i
wish
i
had
more
pours
a
deep
and
clear
brownish
amberorange
a
thick
pillowy
tan
head
sticks
all
over
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
very
good
and
dessertlike
all
kinds
of
tasty
malts
and
a
touch
of
honey
taste
is
rich
and
full
a
roasted
feeling
lasts
the
entire
time
with
an
added
bonus
of
spices
which
also
linger
in
the
finish
its
tight
and
sweet
yet
fulfilling
its
richness
prevents
a
long
session
but
this
beer
does
exactly
what
a
warmer
even
tho
its
not
should
do
satisfy
the
taste
buds
and
stomach
in
a
short
amount
of
time
very
good
served
in
a
tulip
pours
a
moderatelydark
brown
tending
toward
a
dark
caramel
color
singlefinger
white
head
to
begin
quickly
falling
into
a
thin
white
collar
and
a
few
bubbles
around
the
edges
the
nose
brings
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
and
a
mild
darkfruit
presence
somewhat
dry
and
not
too
spicy
not
sure
if
it
ever
was
the
taste
is
nice
and
moderatelysweet
with
a
pronounced
caramel
presence
no
real
spice
but
there
is
a
mild
understated
hop
character
there
medium
body
and
a
fairlydry
finish
drinks
pretty
well
overall
glad
we
got
to
try
this
now
that
i
know
its
not
being
bottled
any
longer
the
beer
pours
a
brownishamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
one
dimensional
i
get
a
lot
of
toffee
notes
but
that
is
it
no
hops
spices
etc
the
flavor
is
much
more
complex
and
a
big
improvement
over
the
aroma
i
get
a
lot
of
caramel
and
toffee
malts
but
there
is
also
a
nice
hop
component
to
the
flavor
i
get
some
grass
and
pine
hops
which
provide
a
nice
bit
of
bitterness
to
balance
out
all
of
the
malt
sweetness
i
also
get
some
cocoa
in
the
flavor
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
spice
but
if
it
is
there
it
is
very
subtle
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
another
good
beer
from
goose
island
this
beers
spent
a
year
on
the
shelf
and
its
hard
to
tell
if
the
age
has
been
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
the
malt
seems
nicely
developed
but
i
wouldve
liked
to
have
experienced
the
fresh
spices
regardless
of
flavor
i
enjoy
the
knowledge
that
my
purchase
of
this
beer
allowed
goose
island
to
donate
some
cash
to
the
chicago
christmas
ship
a
vessel
that
sails
from
michigan
to
chicago
with
a
cargo
of
christmas
trees
to
give
to
disadvantaged
families
good
beer
cool
cause
poured
aggressively
for
a
2finger
head
reduces
to
a
thin
bubbly
film
lacing
is
very
sticky
color
is
cloudy
crimsonbrown
aroma
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
fresh
sweet
amber
malts
taste
has
an
excellent
malt
character
with
caramel
and
light
vanilla
when
the
malt
has
this
complexity
it
tricks
me
into
thinking
about
vanilla
the
last
beer
to
do
that
was
lagunitas
lucky
13
alcohol
is
nonexistent
and
i
could
sip
this
all
night
let
it
warm
up
just
a
little
bit
im
not
sure
what
makes
this
a
christmas
ale
but
i
enjoyed
it
anyway
if
i
knew
this
wasnt
a
spiced
winter
ale
i
would
have
opened
it
much
sooner
but
i
wasnt
about
to
open
a
christmas
ale
in
the
spring
so
it
sat
until
christmas
2010
it
help
up
really
nice
but
id
love
to
try
a
fresh
version
a
fantastic
beer
and
a
wonderful
drop
to
celebrate
christmas
with
the
family
a
year
of
age
on
it
wonderful
im
not
sure
what
its
like
fresh
but
the
integration
and
balance
is
just
right
a
year
on
really
lovely
drinkable
a
little
too
sweet
probably
one
and
done
poured
into
tulip
style
glass
the
best
part
of
this
beer
for
me
was
the
appearance
after
that
it
was
just
plain
boring
ok
smellok
tasteok
mouthfeeljust
ok
was
hoping
for
better
from
goose
island
should
just
call
goose
island
american
boring
brown
ale
maybe
it
is
because
my
wife
is
enjoying
a
three
philosophers
with
our
roasted
chestnuts
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
did
not
meet
my
expectations
at
all
especially
from
such
a
sold
brewery
as
goose
island
maybe
a
fresher
example
with
some
hop
profile
may
have
helped
but
it
is
just
average
compared
to
other
winter
offerings
i
have
had
recently
it
is
still
above
average
and
quite
drinkable
but
leaves
me
wanting
a
little
more
note
2009
vintage
overall
a
good
beer
that
mellowed
nicely
with
some
cellar
time
this
was
from
the
2009
vintage
dated
101909
it
poured
a
smooth
hazelnut
in
color
with
a
two
finger
beige
head
the
smell
is
malty
with
a
smooth
citrusy
aroma
to
it
the
citrus
part
is
interesting
because
its
a
sweet
citrus
scent
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
taste
is
pretty
stellar
for
an
amber
it
has
some
hoppyness
that
makes
your
mouth
water
to
accompany
the
subtle
malt
flavor
being
over
a
year
old
it
drinks
very
very
smoothly
but
still
has
good
crispness
when
it
hits
your
palate
i
really
liked
this
and
i
dont
normally
like
ambers
its
too
bad
goose
island
isnt
brewing
this
one
again
this
year
easy
drinker
definatly
worth
a
try
taste
of
roasted
malts
browned
sugars
some
light
spices
light
vanilla
and
some
nutty
flavors
mixed
with
a
light
caramelized
sugar
presence
overall
pretty
well
put
together
with
a
medium
body
at
first
there
was
a
tongue
stinging
carbonation
level
that
after
45
mins
or
so
calmed
down
to
a
nice
subtle
nice
carb
level

poured
a
copper
brown
color
with
a
bit
over
a
finger
of
a
slightly
brown
head
clung
well
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
it
receded
smelled
of
mostly
roasted
malts
molasses
some
mild
cinnamon
a
small
amount
of
hops
tiny
bit
of
clove
taste
wasnt
what
i
would
expect
for
a
brown
ale
was
a
rich
roasted
malty
tasting
a
little
bitter
at
the
end
but
spices
were
subtle
but
a
nice
element
was
medium
bodied
light
to
medium
carbonation
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
first
holiday
beer
of
the
season
albeit
from
last
season
like
a
goblet
full
of
fresh
goose
blood
it
has
vibrant
color
and
pungent
aroma
tremendous
malt
complexity
slight
oxidation
adds
brilliantly
to
the
bouquet
sweetbread
caramel
shit
it
even
smells
sticky
flavor
is
very
similar
but
has
a
wellbalanced
bitter
to
it
and
finishes
drier
and
thinner
than
i
thought
it
would
its
a
fine
beer
a
fine
beer
drinkability
a
decent
holiday
ale
from
a
good
brewery
basically
a
slightly
dressed
up
brown
ale
i
would
prefer
a
higher
gravityalcohol
version
of
this
beer
taste
is
similar
up
front
it
is
a
jammyspicey
sweet
brown
bread
with
hints
of
rum
fruit
and
wood
followed
by
a
drier
finish
with
leafywoodytoastycitrusyspicey
bitterness
and
toasty
dryness
joining
the
jammy
fruitiness
before
becoming
a
sweet
and
spiceybitter
aftertaste
with
a
lot
of
caramelised
fruit
toast
and
jam
with
light
rumminess
it
is
balanced
complex
rich
but
light
a
faint
warmth
fullbodied
but
very
drinkable
d
the
sweetness
might
make
it
hard
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
but
i
suspect
that
in
the
colder
winter
months
this
one
would
flow
quite
nicely
an
over
all
nice
beer
that
fulfills
a
great
role
as
a
holiday
brew
certainly
not
the
best
cold
weather
drink
it
has
a
subtle
charm
that
grows
on
you
after
a
while
i
think
i
will
enjoy
these

delicious
and
very
drinkable
ive
been
sitting
on
this
for
a
few
months
now
and
it
was
sitting
in
the
beer
store
for
a
few
months
more
than
that
seems
to
age
pretty
well
wish
i
had
a
few
more
bottles
to
sit
on
round
i
would
probably
drink
it
all
the
time
nice
christmas
offering
notes
the
hops
were
a
bit
surprising
to
me
at
first
for
a
brown
alechristmas
beer
but
everything
comes
together
nicely
in
the
finish
i
also
like
that
it
keeps
the
spicing
to
a
mellow
level
which
adds
to
its
drinkability
in
my
opinion
pours
from
the
bottle
into
a
nice
slighty
hazy
pour
topped
off
with
some
good
offwhite
head
pleasant
holiday
aromas
of
lightly
roasted
malt
chestnuts
caramel
and
raisins
flavors
of
dark
fruits
dark
spices
and
bready
malt
a
good
solid
seasonal
effort
a
bit
light
for
a
brown
more
like
a
dark
amber
with
a
god
head
and
lacing
a
bit
of
chill
haze
but
fairly
clear
smell
is
very
malty
with
a
rich
fruitiness
caramel
and
dark
breads
combined
with
figs
apples
and
pears
hops
are
earthy
and
sit
on
top
of
a
light
butterscotch
biscuit
aroma
taste
is
very
american
brown
a
bigger
personality
than
the
british
version
a
strong
caramel
malt
backbone
unfolds
a
bready
layer
with
all
of
the
nose
characteristics
as
well
very
roasty
toasty
mmm
a
nice
carameltoffee
sweetnessthe
finish
shows
off
a
superb
hop
blend
that
opens
with
an
english
earthiness
flowing
into
a
mild
grapefruit
skin
bitterness
that
dries
and
cleans
the
mouth
a
nice
yeasty
breadiness
remains
lightly
feel
is
crisp
and
somewhat
creamy
weight
is
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
a
very
drinkable
winter
ale
that
is
coming
in
handy
on
this
cool
night
d
a
good
beer
that
fits
the
mood
for
the
holiday
season
enjoyable
enough
for
what
it
is
i
could
easily
tip
back
a
few
of
these
bottles
decently
drinkable
overall
a
good
but
not
outstanding
brown
winter
ale
d
ok
but
not
too
flavorful
esp
for
an
xmas
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
tasty
brown
ale
an
under
appreciated
style
with
a
nice
bit
of
umphh
from
the
hops
but
i
dont
see
how
theyd
expect
this
would
age
well
for
5
years
in
the
bottle
the
hops
might
last
a
year
the
malt
maybe
two
and
then
or
really
think
it
represents
christmas
particularly
well
it
certainly
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
grabbed
it
off
the
shelf
not
reading
the
label
until
i
got
home
after
which
i
was
disappointed
enough
to
put
it
off
until
i
stumbled
across
it
today
again
good
beer
but
poorly
marketed
and
priced
should
in

packs
as
a
year
round
brown
this
is
a
pleasant
seasonal
unassuming
but
lacking
the
elegance
i
seek
in
this
style
however
as
a
light
version
of
the
style
it
works
well
with
a
casual

2009
christmas
ale
is
a
clear
dense
redbrown
ale
with
a
huge
lumpy
foamy
off
white
head
that
has
oily
bubbles
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
bready
and
spicy
aroma
it
doesnt
smell
too
sweet
but
theres
plenty
of
malt
there
are
notes
of
pine
resin
and
maybe
juniper
orange
peel
and
nutmeg
its
mediumfull
bodied
and
quite
smooth
it
has
a
dry
finish
leaves
the
mouth
slightly
chalky
it
has
a
well
balanced
flavor
its
resiny
but
there
is
also
a
sweet
flavor
like
prune
or
fig
the
bitterness
is
sufficient
and
casual
this
may
be
a
brown
ale
but
it
has
characteristics
of
both
a
red
ale
and
a
strong
ale
as
i
finish
the
bottle
im
still
trying
to
determine
if
its
spiced
or
not
poured
a
super
hazy
dark
orange
amber
with
virtually
no
head
aroma
is
super
sweet
and
malty
there
is
an
awesome
doughy
readiness
to
the
nose
in
addition
to
lots
o
malt
taste
is
wayyy
to
sweet
lots
of
brown
sugar
presesnt
here
in
fact
it
tastes
like
lagunitas
brown
sugga
except
less
alcohol
presence
not
much
hoppage
is
detectable
here
i
think
its
neccessary
to
balance
the
insane
sweetness
this
christmas
ale
seems
to
be
very
light
on
the
christmas
spices
but
there
are
hints
of
dark
fruit
feel
is
kinda
tingly
and
rough
from
the
carbonation
unfortunately
i
wouldnt
want
to
much
of
this
but
a
sample
but
be
just
fine
not
bad
but
not
great
another
fine
ohoove
contribution
this
holiday
brew
shows
a
dark
brownruby
mahogany
color
with
a
big
greytan
head
and
very
nice
lacing
the
first
sniff
says
nutty
malt
and
subtle
piny
hops
quite
nice
and
not
a
typical
holiday
smell
the
flavor
comes
on
with
a
beautiful
malthop
blend
topped
with
a
nice
brown
sugar
and
allspice
kiss
the
hops
finish
a
little
dry
on
your
tongue
and
there
is
a
walnut
earthy
quality
with
grassy
highlights
quite
drinkable
with
solid
midbody
feel
not
a
classic
holiday
brew
but
a
very
lovely
concoction
that
i
would
enjoy
any
time
of
year
i
found
this
more
drinkable
then
i
expected
i
opened
this
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
another
spice
bomb
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
really
enjoyable
balanced
malty
beer
one
of
the
better
christmas
beers
i
have
had
a
definite
winner
in
my
book
goose
island
claims
you
can
age
it
for
5
years
but
i
like
the
hop
character
it
has
a
few
months
in
and
wouldnt
want
to
age
it
myself
drinkability
though
there
were
no
bad
charcteristics
it
was
delicious
but
the
result
of
everything
put
together
is
just
a
little
too
much
to
drink
more
than
22
ounces
of
it
i
ended
up
drinking
the
entire
22oz
bottle
on
my
own
and
it
was
ok
i
wouldnt
rush
out
to
get
another
but
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
it
was
a
nice
gift
i
received
this
is
a
very
drinkable
american
brown
ale
with
a
nice
dry
hoppy
taste
not
much
alcohol
but
the
flavor
is
huge
and
it
lubricates
the
tongue
for
another
this
is
a
rare
sessionable
christmas
ale
one
i
could
drink
all
night
and
not
get
tired
of
the
malts
and
spices
make
this
seem
like
a
larger
beer
but
it
finishes
well
and
leaves
a
taste
of
raisin
on
my
tongue
this
beer
pours
a
deep
translucent
auburn
with
an
okay
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
fruity
malt
with
apricot
raspberries
and
sweet
cherries
coming
through
the
flavor
is
definitely
not
faithful
to
the
style
but
thats
our
affectation
and
not
the
brewerys
its
relatively
sweet
and
malty
with
lots
of
malt
fruitiness
on
the
palate
this
is
a
good
and
interesting
beer
but
it
lacks
complexity
and
a
real
hook
that
seems
a
bit
contradictory
but
the
beer
is
interesting
as
being
malt
fruit
dominant
but
boring
as
these
flavors
are
easily
appreciated
and
dont
really
go
anywhere
this
is
a
nice
christmas
ale
that
avoids
the
common
holiday
beer
pitfalls
but
it
doesnt
really
have
a
big
enough
backbone
or
enough
soul
to
grab
me
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
ever
feel
the
need
to
buy
again
overall
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
i
think
it
is
a
nice
winter
beer
but
nothing
i
would
go
crazy
for
the
price
is
rather
high
for
the
bomber
as
well
drinkable
but
nothing
amazing
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
good
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
but
not
the
first
xmas
seasonal
that
i
would
choose
d
flavorful
and
fairly
balanced
the
spices
add
a
layer
of
complexity
very
enjoyable
and
a
very
pleasant
surprise
that
breaks
the
mold
for
this
style
christmas
ale
this
leans
more
towards
an
ale
than
some
christmas
beers
out
there
that
over
spice
the
beer
in
an
attempt
to
seem
seasonal
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
and
tasty
4
5
d
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
one
of
the
few
brews
that
impresses
me
without
having
tons
of
flavor
this
is
a
relatively
simple
brew
that
displays
a
good
recipe
and
great
technique
picked
this
brew
up
since
most
of
the
goose
island
brews
i
have
tried
i
have
liked
nice
looking
art
bottled
on
103009
brew
poured
to
a
nice
russet
brown
color
with
a
somewhat
thinnish
head
but
the
retention
was
good
leaving
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
nice
it
does
have
properties
of
a
brown
ale
slight
coffee
with
a
nice
nut
like
aroma
but
also
perhaps
a
slight
spiciness
the
aroma
works
for
me
more
on
the
brown
ale
side
than
spiced
holiday
brew
some
bread
like
aromas
as
well
the
flavor
while
a
little
odd
is
very
good
biscuit
and
a
slight
cocoa
flavor
that
breaks
to
a
mild
hop
spiciness
hop
flavor
lingers
at
the
back
of
the
moth
for
a
bit
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
a
22
in
a
sitting
but
it
is
a
good
brew
and
one
i
would
get
in
the
future
be
interested
to
see
if
the
profile
of
the
brew
changes
year
over
year
when
released
its
that
kind
of
beer
d
a
highly
drinkable
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
and
local
breweries
but
not
quite
what
i
would
expect
of
a
christmas
beer
it
has
a
well
balanced
blend
of
flavors
between
the
sweet
and
roasty
malts
along
with
hints
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
spice
dark
fruits
and
general
holiday
flavorsaromas
but
im
not
getting
that
here
i
feel
like
i
can
get
a
beer
like
this
any
time
of
the
year
and
that
its
nothing
special
for
the
holidays
dan
interesting
brown
much
more
complex
than
its
typical
british
counterparts
ehh
not
too
impressed
with
this
i
would
not
buy
this
again
nothing
stood
out
and
i
kind
of
wish
this
was
not
a
bomber
d
it
is
a
great
christmas
ale
i
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
version
of
great
lakes
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
this
is
terrific
and
highly
recommended
d
a
pretty
average
brown
ale
i
would
say
a
little
dissapointing
for
a
seasonal
release
i
think
d
a
nice
seasonal
offering
overall
spice
flavors
give
this
beer
a
welcome
extra
layer
of
complexity
overall
on
their
goose
island
website
they
call
this
a
brown
ale
but
this
is
the
most
funkiest
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
definitely
a
unique
brew
and
if
you
cross
paths
with
it
i
highly
recommend
you
to
try
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
copper
color
with
1
finger
of
head
that
settles
into
a
ring
smells
of
caramel
malt
with
faint
hints
of
nutmeg
or
allspice
and
a
wisp
of
citrusy
hops
surprisingly
big
malt
flavors
greet
the
pallet
first
along
with
a
thick
sweet
mouthfeel
some
biscutiness
towards
the
end
and
then
a
lingering
finish
that
is
slightly
bitter
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
great
beer
i
first
got
this
at
premier
gormet
and
it
was
great
tasting
brew
i
had
the
other
goose
island
beers
and
was
very
impressed
with
them
too
anyone
want
a
festive
beer
this
should
be
on
your
list
to
me
it
was
a
nice
full
bodied
brew
with
the
classic
holiday
spices
that
you
would
normally
find
in
this
style
not
bad
in
price
either
d
quite
drinkable
prob
my
favorite
holiday
beer
so
far
really
enjoyed
the
moderate
use
of
spices
in
this
one
d
waited
to
open
this
on
christmas
eve
and
i
was
not
disappointed
a
really
good
winter
warmer
good
atmosphere
sppearance
is
pretty
solid
but
standard
for
a
brown
ale
nose
is
full
of
components
very
sweet
and
pleasing
good
balanced
flavor
componets
sweet
and
bitter
and
hoppy
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
its
certainly
a
different
route
from
the
usual
christmas
ale
looking
for
a
hoppy
brown
then
this
is
your
beer
for
christmas
juicy
balanced
and
very
drinkable
fine
christmas
ale
i
like
the
idea
of
a
christmas
goose
but
i
think
ill
be
sticking
to
turkey
this
year
that
being
said
im
happy
to
have
enjoyed
goose
islands
christmas
ale
on
christmas
day
and
by
extension
to
have
contributed
to
a
very
worthwhile
charity
to
which
a
share
of
the
profits
from
this
bottle
will
go
this
beer
has
certainly
brought
me
more
yuletide
cheer
drinkability

a
great
option
for
a
holiday
beer
outside
the
standard
winter
beer
very
tasty
d
a
nice
beer
to
drink
on
a
cold
christmas
eve
in
california
not
my
favorite
winter
warmer
or
brown
ale
but
im
very
glad
to
be
able
to
try
more
of
goose
islands
offerings
poured
from
12oz
bottle
2007
vintage
a
pours
a
nice
brownish
coppery
color
one
and
a
half
finger
tannish
head
that
stays
a
round
for
a
short
bit
before
dying
down
light
lacing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
s
there
is
a
pretty
big
caramel
malt
aroma
to
this
some
lighter
hints
of
darker
fruits
plum
and
fig
also
some
very
light
bitter
hopping
in
maybe
the
very
end
of
this
beer
some
kind
of
spice
in
there
but
very
faint
maybe
cinnamon
or
brown
sugar
t
light
oxidation
with
this
i
must
say
not
much
but
you
can
taste
metallic
hints
in
the
very
back
of
this
big
caramel
malts
in
the
front
with
some
spice
in
the
middle
there
is
a
metallic
hint
from
here
on
out
but
the
light
hopping
on
the
end
cuts
the
taste
and
almost
washes
it
away
m
medium
mouthfeel
carbonation
was
alright
for
the
most
part
spice
and
malts
were
left
on
the
palate
and
in
the
aftertaste
long
after
the
beer
was
gone
not
quite
clean
tasting
but
close
d
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
more
of
maybe
ill
reddish
amber
body
finger
and
a
half
tan
head
slow
dissipation
with
nice
lacing
sweetish
nose
a
bit
more
cocoa
than
dark
chocolate
not
much
spice
to
speak
of
and
there
was
a
bit
of
hop
bite
masked
by
the
fruity
sweetness
a
really
great
tasting
winter
warmer
the
sweetness
is
nicely
balanced
by
subtle
spices
and
hoppiness
nicely
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
the
consensus
was
this
was
one
of
the
stars
of
the
night
and
ill
certainly
be
seeking
out
another
bottle
of
this
very
accessible
worth
bringing
to
a
holiday
party
for
craft
newbies
highly
recommended
eric
poured
a
deep
deep
brown
with
reddish
hues
had
good
carbonation
and
a
small
sirty
white
head
nose
is
dominated
by
caramel
syrup
spice
taste
is
a
warming
roasty
caramel
syrup
and
some
spice
althought
it
was
tasty
i
was
not
to
big
of
a
fan
because
tnothing
made
this
beer
stand
out
good
but
not
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
average
a
solid
offering
but
it
isnt
going
to
blow
anyone
away
it
poured
a
good
looking
dark
brown
with
a
23
finger
foam
head
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
was
biscuity
malt
and
faint
hops
in
the
background
taste
was
okay
not
much
too
it
i
didnt
find
much
that
was
extraordinary
from
it
it
was
refreshing
but
overall
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
to
me
not
worth
the
6
for
the
bomber
pretty
much
a
middle
of
the
road
brown
overall
a
very
good
american
brown
as
its
labeled
here
but
an
excellent
winter
warmer
if
you
ask
me
i
feel
like
this
is
an
honest
wellcrafted
beer
that
just
doesnt
particularly
appeal
to
me
if
you
particularly
like
brown
ales
or
toastedmalt
beers
in
general
you
may
quite
like
this
beer
indeed
drinkability
seems
like
a
very
nice
cross
between
an
american
brown
ale
and
an
english
strong
ale
nice
stuff
d
drinkable
i
think
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
this
is
a
pretty
good
seasonal
brew
hard
to
pin
down
the
spices
used
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
the
label
says
it
can
be
aged
up
to
5
years
but
to
be
honest
it
didnt
seem
as
if
it
would
have
benefited
much
by
letting
this
one
sit
i
did
appreciate
that
this
beer
wasnt
a
coffee
or
hop
bomb
it
was
just
a
nice
understated
brew
to
relax
with
this
winter
season
d
per
the
label
the
recipe
does
change
annually
yet
no
mention
is
made
of
branching
out
beyond
the
stated
american
brown
ale
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
definitely
doesnt
match
the
stated
style
id
recommend
with
the
caveat
that
one
not
read
too
much
good
enough
to
have
again
though
not
one
worth
seeking
out
also
i
cant
imagine
this
brew
cellaring
particularly
well
either
huh
just
plain
huh
sweet
grassy
nose
thats
not
bad
just
not
christmas
for
me
nor
brown
ale
for
that
matter
not
getting
this
as
a
brown
or
winter
ale
hence
not
one
id
buy
again
d
a
solid
holiday
ale
from
a
solid
brewery
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
it
is
a
touch
more
subdued
than
most
other
holiday
ales
can
be
yet
it
works
very
well
i
have
a
couple
more
bottles
in
the
cellar
and
i
hope
that
i
can
resist
them
for
awhile
because
id
love
to
see
how
this
does
with
a
year
or
more
of
age
on
it
i
think
it
will
age
well
along
the
lines
of
anchor
osa
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
whatsoever
aroma
is
very
sweet
dominated
by
caramel
with
cinammon
appleand
molasses
notes
beneath
it
flavor
features
prominent
roasted
malt
and
hop
bitterness
with
a
balance
of
the
molasses
and
caramel
a
longer
finish
d
pretty
good
solid
brew
drinkability
as
i
said
before
this
is
a
subtle
beer
that
will
reward
the
patient
drinker
from
beginning
to
end
i
suppose
you
could
age
it
a
bit
to
meld
the
flavors
but
i
found
the
various
smells
and
tastes
to
be
quite
entertaining
goose
xmas
09
is
fun
to
pour
fun
to
smell
and
a
pretty
good
drink
the
alcohol
comes
off
a
little
hot
for
me
but
otherwise
no
complaints
definitely
worth
a
try
my
overall
opinion
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
ale
with
just
the
right
amount
of
balance
in
taste
mouthfeel
it
is
something
that
both
experienced
beer
advocates
and
newbies
alike
could
sit
down
and
enjoy
together
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
ive
had
this
now
both
on
tap
and
in
a
bottle
i
prefer
the
bottle
version
slightly
better
but
that
just
might
be
a
function
of
mood
d
drinkable
actually
sessionable
but
not
a
huge
fan
good
to
style
i
think
but
not
my
favorite
winter
brew
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
carbonation
this
stands
up
pretty
well
to
local
nutcracker
ale
d
a
remarkably
smooth
beer
although
a
bit
mild
the
perfect
beer
to
sit
back
with
and
enjoy
on
a
cold
winter
evening
mouthfeel
is
a
light
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
quite
drinkable
quaffable
if
you
will
this
drink
is
utterly
growing
on
me
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
and
i
like
it
all
from
the
sweetness
i
would
look
for
in
a
winter
warmer
which
then
lends
itself
to
a
great
hoppypiney
profile
but
finishes
up
strong
with
some
great
spices
but
not
overboard
which
some
do
amazingly
balanced
which
is
exactly
what
i
personally
look
for
in
a
winter
warmer
a
damn
good
beer
from
gi
im
glad
i
snagged
this
when
it
was
available
out
here
in
ca
very
easy
to
drink
ale
one
of
the
lighter
winter
warmers
this
one
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
because
of
the
mild
taste
d
easy
to
get
down
tasty
could
do
more
than
one
of
the
big
bottle
12
oz
bottle
rich
brown
color
very
opaque
with
medium
head
taste
lots
of
caramel
sweetness
with
not
much
else
going
on
putting
this
close
to
malt
bomb
territory
mouthfeel
is
heavy
due
to
the
sweetness
although
it
has
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
a
decent
brew
but
there
are
better
christmas
ales
out
there
christmas
goose
is
a
cloudy
brown
in
color
with
a
respectable
beige
head
that
reduced
to
a
skin
the
aroma
is
citruslike
this
is
where
it
gets
a
little
weird
the
taste
you
know
that
taste
you
get
when
the
dentist
gets
some
novocain
on
your
tongue
thats
what
it
tasted
like
i
know
weird
after
it
warmed
a
little
it
became
malty
sweet
and
a
bit
soapy
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
adequate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
despite
the
odd
taste
i
first
experienced
xmas
goose
is
still
a
pretty
good
beer
d
while
finding
this
beer
relatively
enjoyable
i
am
a
little
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
spices
that
i
think
generally
defines
the
winter
warmer
style
the
bottle
says
to
age
up
to
5
years
and
perhaps
it
will
be
better
then
in
short
i
am
glad
i
have
tried
it
but
really
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
overall
a
really
good
beer
for
a
chilly
night
in
wny
im
not
a
big
christmas
fan
but
this
one
is
light
enough
in
aroma
and
flavor
to
make
it
good
enough
to
drink
and
drink
more
than
one
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
again
but
if
i
had
to
have
a
christmas
beer
id
pick
this
d
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
more
than
a
filler
in
between
some
other
good
beers
this
one
is
skippable
overall
very
drinkable
winter
warmer
if
a
bit
subdued
tis
the
season
shows
a
reddish
copper
with
a
creamy
tan
froth
with
great
lacing
aromas
of
caramel
toffee
subtle
raisin
prune
baking
spice
cinnamon
pecans
waffle
vanilla
easy
brown
sugar
smooth
and
creamy
on
the
palate
with
flavors
of
vanilla
toffee
spices
a
slight
citrus
hop
bitterness
overall
a
great
beer
with
a
soft
and
complex
nose
and
creamy
texture
there
are
better
christmas
beers
but
for
6
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
pours
a
brownish
amber
with
a
large
tan
head
nice
retention
lace
and
sticky
bubbles
aromas
of
brown
sugar
prune
pecan
and
nutmeg
make
for
a
nice
bouquet
tastes
of
brown
sugar
light
roasted
nuts
prune
and
a
peppery
alcohol
bite
the
bottle
says
this
brew
will
evolve
for
five
years
in
the
bottle
which
is
probably
true
but
i
would
rather
have
the
beer
perfectly
drinkable
right
now
if
we
are
being
honest
about
it
the
finish
is
quite
floral
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
semismooth
medium
carbonation
nice
brew
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
creamy
and
rich
the
body
of
beer
is
medium
thick
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
is
a
hearty
winter
warmer
although
i
would
have
like
to
seen
more
spice
and
bit
i
like
how
it
does
what
it
is
suppose
to
do
it
is
yummy
d
the
moderate
alcohol
and
pleasant
flavors
make
this
beer
quite
drinkable
im
not
necessarily
the
biggest
fan
of
winter
warmers
but
this
one
has
a
nice
combination
of
flavors
and
aromas
d
soso
not
really
a
beer
for
me
but
its
fairly
drinkable
tastes
wet
malt
on
the
draw
but
dries
out
in
the
mouth
malt
is
toasted
grains
and
nut
with
chocolate
undertones
smooth
hop
flavor
accompanied
by
mild
grassy
bitter
that
increases
in
the
finish
spicing
is
flat
and
dry
allspice
mostly
with
some
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
spice
comes
on
late
when
the
beer
is
drying
out
im
not
fond
of
the
finish
mild
heartburn
in
my
belly
is
also
unpleasant
clean
alcohol
in
the
mouth
mdheavy
carbonation
and
md
body
time
will
likely
be
a
friend
to
this
beer
i
find
it
disjointed
right
now
enjoy
drinkability
fairly
wellbalanced
and
pretty
refreshing
not
too
heavy
on
spice
but
nothing
stands
out
too
much
either
d
its
easy
enough
to
drink
might
get
bored
alright
age
it
instead
of
drinking
it
now
i
am
not
digging
this
one
too
much
sorry
i
will
buy
another
bottle
probably
but
it
just
seems
pretty
lacking
given
the
price
tag
overall
a
very
good
winter
warmer
nicely
built
body
is
a
little
thin
for
a
winter
beer
but
the
more
delicate
flavors
and
lower
alcohol
present
in
this
beer
make
for
an
appropriate
mouthfeel
an
enjoyable
offering
new
id
like
to
lay
one
down
and
see
how
it
ages
over
a
few
years
overall
great
great
winter
warmer
but
to
me
its
an
amber
malt
pale
extra
special
briess
dark
d
i
like
the
clean
balance
of
this
beer
too
many
in
the
style
are
over
the
top
in
spicing
good
as
a
taster
to
contrast
the
other
great
gi
beers
but
otherwise
not
very
drinkable
to
me
this
beer
was
hoppy
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
the
did
not
seem
to
balance
for
me
they
seemed
to
be
to
separate
tastes
in
the
same
beer
there
was
a
real
creamy
almost
frothy
feel
to
the
beer
i
remember
liking
this
beer
more
last
year
i
guess
things
change
but
it
is
still
quite
drinkable
d
mouthfeel
and
low
abv
make
this
a
good
winter
session
beer
balanced
flavor
also
helps
in
this
category
alcohol
definitely
warms
you
up
after
the
first
couple
the
1st
winter
warmer
ive
had
with
no
warmth
drinkability
i
read
the
label
and
saw
that
the
abv
was
5
6
not
extremely
high
which
adds
to
the
drinkability
im
not
usually
one
for
a
christmas
beer
just
because
that
sort
of
thing
usually
isnt
my
bag
but
i
was
not
disappointed
here
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
and
left
me
understanding
the
saying
never
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
i
wouldnt
make
it
a
session
brew
but
it
was
a
solid
choice
that
left
me
wanting
to
experiment
with
goose
islands
selections
in
the
future
overall
a
fairly
solid
beer
during
the
winter
this
is
a
good
one
to
savor
every
once
in
a
while
fullishmedium
in
body
with
fine
carbonation
the
drink
is
too
hot
and
a
smidge
too
sticky
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
but
make
no
mistake
goose
islands
is
one
fine
winter
warmer
that
really
does
the
job
in
earning
the
designation
thanks
to
dr
brad
for
the
hookup
goose
islands
christmas
release
is
a
good
one
while
i
do
find
it
a
little
inferior
to
some
other
holiday
releases
its
far
from
a
bad
choice
the
nose
could
use
some
work
but
its
satisfying
in
all
other
respects
easily
recommended
have
never
been
impressed
with
this
beer
from
a
bottle
got
to
try
it
on
tap
yesterday
and
it
was
much
improved
from
the
bottle
ive
gotten
no
spicing
just
a
regular
old
brown
ale
on
tap
it
has
a
definite
nose
of
pine
needles
and
juniper
or
elderberries
very
intriguing
overall
it
delivers
a
nice
brown
session
experience
although
the
new
holland
cabin
fever
wins
out
over
this
one
md
very
drinkable
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
to
have
multiple
gi
christmas
ale
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
pretty
good
head
its
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
there
is
some
cherries
in
there
and
a
slight
bit
of
piney
smelling
hops
the
flavor
has
a
really
nice
sweet
caramel
tasting
malt
backbone
with
some
nice
cinnamons
and
other
holiday
spices
it
has
a
really
nice
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
a
holiday
treat
drinkability
is
great
there
is
great
complexity
and
richness
ehre
without
the
usual
overlyspiced
quality
that
some
winter
warmers
can
take
on
one
of
the
better
brews
from
goose
clybourn
cheers
d
this
christmas
ale
has
held
up
well
and
is
very
enjoyable
abv
is
low
and
unnoticeable
if
i
find
more
of
these
in
oh
on
my
next
trip
for
1
19
i
will
buy
them
all
im
learning
that
goose
island
doesnt
so
much
go
for
extreme
flavors
but
hangs
its
hat
on
the
craftsmanship
of
quality
flavors
mouthfeel
is
smooth
a
nice
full
body
but
light
enough
and
with
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
quite
enjoyable
a
clear
red
ale
that
pour
with
a
enough
foam
to
create
a
bit
of
a
rocky
head
just
some
tiny
bits
of
lace
are
left
behind
as
the
head
falls
the
nose
has
a
complex
but
subtle
spiciness
buried
in
a
toastedcaramel
malt
nose
its
a
bit
too
hard
for
me
to
discern
what
spices
are
lurking
there
but
they
come
out
more
in
the
taste
hints
of
allspice
clove
and
maybe
even
cinnamon
english
tasting
read
goldings
fuggless
hops
are
tasted
and
give
the
beer
nice
balance
especially
in
the
finish
this
is
fullbodied
which
i
appreciate
this
time
of
year
a
fairly
hearty
ale
for
the
season
for
sure
but
certainly
on
the
cusp
of
being
sessionable
i
am
a
fan
of
goose
island
beers
and
this
is
a
respectable
offering
but
there
is
something
missing
its
good
beer
but
i
find
myself
not
being
very
interested
in
it
d
very
easy
to
drink
could
easily
be
a
session
so
bottle
says
will
age
for
5
years
huh
not
really
much
in
this
one
its
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
pretty
straight
forward
lets
see
is
this
develops
into
something
anything
d
id
have
to
be
in
the
mood
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
its
sessionable
but
the
spices
would
get
old
pretty
quick
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
with
absolutely
beautiful
color
i
guess
mahogany
best
describes
it
decent
head
very
nice
smell
and
the
taste
is
almost
as
nice
as
the
appearance
the
spice
blend
is
so
balanced
its
hard
to
depict
a
dominant
flavor
nice
mouthfeel
and
excellent
drinkability
i
like
it
the
way
it
is
so
i
doubt
i
cellar
any
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
may
buy
more
although
i
am
anxious
to
try
some
other
holiday
ales
i
was
a
bit
suprised
at
the
10
49
ticket
on
this
beer
but
the
store
i
bought
from
is
usually
higher
than
most
try
it
its
good
a
delicious
complex
beer
at
the
tender
age
of
1
will
purchase
more
of
these
for
the
cellar
will
develop
up
to
five
years
well
im
keeping
a
couple
in
my
cellar
for
at
least
a
year
this
is
a
hearty
ale
by
the
mighty
goose
aroma
is
fairly
straightforward
consisting
some
caramel
and
roasted
malts
with
a
thick
bitter
hoppiness
wonderful
pour
rich
mahogony
with
a
thick
velvety
tan
head
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
strong
carbonation
can
barely
be
seen
through
the
darkness
strong
biting
mouthfeel
real
creamy
and
good
flavor
is
rich
and
complex
roasty
with
almost
a
burnt
quality
countered
by
a
slight
sweetness
dark
cherries
perhaps
a
touch
of
strong
coffee
makes
a
quick
presence
nice
bittering
hops
really
attack
the
senses
this
signifies
what
a
good
winterchristmas
ale
can
and
should
be
nice
to
settle
in
with
a
couple
of
these
when
the
outside
isnt
so
inviting
taste
hops
and
sweet
malts
tastes
alot
like
a
brown
ale
alcohol
is
there
in
the
aftertaste
making
it
live
up
to
the
style
of
winter
warmer
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
really
like
this
kind
and
i
had
one
last
year
that
i
liked
as
well
goose
island
changes
their
recipe
every
year
and
the
past
two
years
that
i
have
had
it
i
have
liked
it
in
different
ways
a
good
flavorful
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
drank
pretty
easy
a
pretty
simple
winter
warmer
that
makes
me
want
to
try
this
fresher
see
what
the
difference
is
still
very
solid
overall
not
bad
at
all
the
winter
warmer
style
in
general
can
be
hit
or
miss
and
i
would
say
that
this
one
was
more
hit
then
miss
for
sure
but
still
it
was
ok
if
you
are
a
fan
this
one
will
do
good
by
you
pours
a
clear
maroonish
copper
color
with
a
big
nice
beige
lasting
head
smell
is
easily
one
of
the
best
for
a
christmas
brew
yet
nice
vibrant
hops
are
apparent
along
with
a
warm
toasty
malt
presence
taste
is
tart
toasty
to
burnt
malt
but
not
roasty
with
a
finish
of
tart
hops
as
well
average
body
and
carbonation
better
than
most
any
ive
had
in
this
style
nice
very
drinkable
beer
this
one
is
easytodrink
christmas
ale
that
gets
better
with
every
sip
only
had
a
few
beers
from
goose
island
now
but
they
are
pretty
solid
brewery
this
beer
was
not
great
but
pretty
darn
good
for
a
winter
warmer
think
this
might
get
better
with
some
age
under
its
belt
too
recommended
as
an
above
average
christmas
ale
overall
a
fine
example
of
a
winter
warmer
quite
dinkable
with
the
right
amount
of
body
and
spicy
edge
this
wasnt
bad
at
times
it
feels
like
a
beefy
brown
ale
but
the
chewy
malts
and
holidays
spices
definitley
give
off
the
warming
feel
of
a
winter
warmer
the
drinkibility
is
good
so
you
could
definitely
throw
a
couple
of
these
back
on
a
cold
winters
night
the
taste
is
pure
sweet
caramel
malt
some
toffee
perhaps
and
maybe
a
hint
of
tropical
fruits
and
a
bit
of
a
hop
bitterness
aftertaste
this
is
mainly
though
a
caramel
malty
beer
very
good
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
from
top
to
bottom
smelled
of
roasted
caramel
malts
and
dark
fruits
taste
was
nutty
and
full
with
a
good
complexity
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
some
tartness
to
it
overall
drinkability
was
good
but
i
remember
this
as
being
a
little
better
in
years
prior
pours
a
nice
deep
redbrownish
mahogany
with
a
big
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
behind
great
lacing
smells
of
biscuits
nuts
and
some
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
full
of
roasted
almost
burnt
malt
with
some
nuttiness
and
a
piney
hop
finish
medium
in
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
its
a
good
brown
ale
but
it
really
doesnt
stand
out
too
much
amongst
the
other
types
of
christmas
offerings
out
there
for
me
to
want
to
seek
it
out
every
year
at
christmastime
it
smells
malty
with
a
hint
of
carmeltoffee
it
tastes
a
lot
like
it
smells
which
is
similar
to
their
nut
brown
ale
it
had
a
longlasting
aftertaste
more
so
than
an
average
beer
i
had
the
opportunity
to
pair
this
with
ribs
as
well
as
prime
rib
and
this
beer
enjoyed
their
company
both
times
all
in
all
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
offering
i
am
putting
some
in
the
cellar
as
suggested
and
well
see
how
this
is
down
the
road
i
really
like
the
color
a
cloudy
brownish
amber
that
almost
appears
twoshadedthe
upper
half
brown
and
the
lower
amber
there
is
a
subtle
spice
smell
ginger
and
some
cinnamon
moderate
fruit
especially
berry
and
a
roasted
finish
that
im
fond
of
its
very
wellbalanced
and
the
carbonation
is
just
right
enhancing
the
smooth
body
quite
well
done
and
again
im
wanting
six
instead
of
one
overall
a
pretty
good
winter
seasonal
brew
especially
for
a
spiced
beer
which
sometimes
happen
to
be
over
spiced
i
could
drink
one
of
two
of
these
at
a
time
and
i
think
it
would
go
very
well
with
a
christmas
or
thanksgiving
dinner
especially
with
ham
and
the
cranberry
sauce
not
sure
if
this
version
is
better
or
if
i
just
appreciate
it
more
spicy
hop
bitterness
is
more
prevalent
tasty
stuff
that
would
probably
age
well
i
would
give
it
more
of
a
3
73
8
right
level
of
creaminess
with
a
crisp
finish
from
the
hops
it
meanders
towards
a
thinness
near
the
end
but
recovers
nicely
either
my
palate
has
changed
or
the
recipe
has
regardless
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
a
few
more
wouldnt
be
unwelcome
d
a
solid
session
ale
highly
drinkable
over
all
good
beer
easy
drinking
i
expect
a
little
more
from
a
christmas
ale
then
a
normal
brown
ale
so
that
was
a
little
let
down
good
beer
to
drink
around
the
holidays
drank
a
bunch
friday
night
will
check
it
out
again
next
year
2007
version
pours
dark
amber
to
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
which
is
large
and
lingering
aroma
is
very
faint
with
hints
of
crystal
malt
and
a
bare
touch
of
hops
flavor
is
crystal
malts
earthy
hops
and
a
nutty
character
that
comes
across
very
nicely
tail
is
roasty
and
sweet
malt
with
another
touch
of
hops
very
balanced
throughout
really
nice
brown
ale
i
hope
to
trade
for
some
more
of
these
before
the
season
is
past
and
i
miss
the
chance
between
this
anchor
and
mad
elf
need
to
hold
me
off
until
late
08
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
dark
tan
head
that
faded
fast
the
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
with
some
fruit
and
hop
notes
the
taste
is
big
and
bold
mixing
the
malt
and
hops
with
other
spices
thrown
in
the
finish
is
fruity
followed
quickly
by
a
strong
hop
flavor
that
lingers
leaving
some
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
which
is
surprising
considering
the
big
flavor
but
the
flavor
is
mixed
quite
well
this
is
a
beer
that
packs
in
some
flavor
for
those
looking
for
a
flavorful
christmas
beer
this
is
a
good
choice
pours
a
great
two
finger
head
that
lasts
almost
all
twelve
ounces
the
color
gets
a
little
browner
the
further
away
the
light
it
is
great
lacing
holds
tight
to
my
honkers
ale
imperial
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
a
malty
bread
aroma
with
a
light
and
effervescent
hoppiness
the
taste
makes
think
of
warm
fires
at
a
cozy
home
bar
with
closefriends
fruity
hints
of
fruit
cake
with
the
toasty
maltiness
smooth
and
mild
on
the
palate
a
great
beer
to
look
forward
to
when
drinkngall
winter
long
with
your
friends
and
family
overall
it
was
a
nice
holiday
brew
it
seemed
fairly
complex
in
its
flavor
and
enjoyable
d
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
holidays
and
probably
the
most
bitter
brown
ale
ive
had
drinkability
being
from
the
chicago
area
this
is
a
beer
i
always
looked
forward
to
at
christmas
time
it
was
simply
a
fantastic
session
beer
and
still
is
aging
really
contributes
little
to
the
beer
but
hasn¬ít
detracted
anything
either
even
after
2
years
4
0
d
actually
did
the
review
on
the
second
beer
of
the
night
so
the
first
one
went
down
exceptionally
smooth
and
pretty
quickly
the
second
one
is
down
to
14
cup
on
my
barilla
jar
and
chances
are
ill
have
one
more
drinkability
is
very
nice
beer
isnt
too
potent
so
a
nice
and
easy
buzz
is
flushing
my
cheeks
drink
it
velvety
smooth
and
creamy
the
moderate
carbonation
cleans
up
the
slightly
syrupy
texture
but
still
allows
it
to
lie
heavy
on
the
palate
and
linger
a
bit
one
of
my
favorite
goose
island
selections
good
beer
for
fans
of
malt
kind
of
a
smaller
version
of
an
old
ale
a
year
of
aging
hasnt
done
too
much
to
this
beer
possibly
accented
the
malt
a
bit
but
this
seems
almost
identical
to
the
previous
year
this
beer
has
a
very
unique
feel
to
it
it
is
very
nutty
but
still
goes
down
smooth
like
any
brown
ale
should
goose
island
never
fails
in
ovffereing
a
beer
that
is
not
hard
to
drink
and
no
matter
how
crafty
it
may
seem
it
still
tastes
great
i
enjoyed
the
light
brown
tone
to
it
not
clear
brown
but
i
wouldnt
say
cloudy
either
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
anytime
especailly
after
a
hefty
meal
id
give
it
another
drink
or
possibly
try
aging
this
beer
but
overall
id
say
its
a
decent
beer
malty
and
nutty
flavors
as
well
i
am
not
sure
what
makes
this
a
christmas
beer
because
i
dont
taste
any
spices
of
other
holiday
flavors
a
decent
brown
ale
altogether
this
is
certianly
a
malty
cool
weather
beer
very
enjoyable
pours
a
nice
brown
with
some
golden
hues
and
a
two
finger
cream
colored
head
with
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
a
touch
of
maple
taste
is
nutty
and
toasted
with
a
little
cocoa
and
caramel
as
well
as
some
slightly
spicy
hops
nice
brown
ale
nothing
spectacular
but
solid
been
a
big
fan
of
different
christmas
ales
the
past
couple
of
years
this
one
purs
beautiful
dark
red
and
nice
creamy
head
lacing
continues
for
awhile
smells
of
warm
malt
tastes
of
roasted
malts
finishes
slightly
bitter
piney
hops
different
from
the
other
chrismas
brews
that
tend
to
have
vanilla
cinnamon
and
ginger
notes
also
noticed
on
the
rear
label
says
flavor
will
continue
to
develop
over
5
years
cool
going
to
celler
4
of
them
their
website
says
this
can
be
aged
for
up
yo
5
years
so
maybe
that
explains
the
hops
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
aroma
and
the
flavors
out
of
tune
it
becomes
a
little
more
balanced
as
it
warms
but
still
not
impressive
this
one
pours
a
red
almost
brownish
color
very
murky
and
dark
with
a
2
thick
creamy
fluffy
off
white
head
smell
is
hoppy
pine
with
a
rich
caramel
malt
taste
is
sweet
malty
flavor
then
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
smooth
and
rich
carbonation
on
this
beer
too
this
was
a
nice
chrismtas
ale
overall
let
this
warm
up
a
bit
for
a
better
aroma
and
taste
good
on
a
cold
night
pours
a
very
dark
amber
copper
color
with
an
off
white
opaque
head
smell
is
complex
with
lots
of
hops
and
malt
fragrance
presence
also
has
a
nice
caramel
scent
with
it
taste
is
equally
intriguing
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
my
favorite
lots
of
malt
taste
with
hops
and
other
spices
all
around
smooth
and
tasty
beer
i
recommend
very
hoppy
flavor
wait
english
brown
goes
with
breadiness
and
a
hint
of
date
im
not
totally
sure
what
makes
this
celebratory
of
xmas
bottle
poured
a
clear
deep
brown
color
ale
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
some
average
retention
and
some
small
lacing
notes
aroma
of
spices
with
a
big
caramel
malt
profile
taste
is
also
dominated
by
a
big
caramel
malt
presence
with
some
sweet
notes
and
a
strange
mixture
of
spices
body
could
have
been
fuller
interesting
but
lacking
something
to
be
truly
great
poured
a
nice
head
that
dissipated
into
a
thin
layer
with
a
great
lacing
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
imperial
nonic
the
color
is
dark
brown
almost
reddish
light
and
easy
to
see
through
a
slightly
spicy
alcohollike
and
hoppy
smell
spices
and
hops
fight
each
other
for
dominance
the
hoppy
taste
is
prevelent
and
the
spicy
flavors
are
in
the
back
ground
its
good
as
an
ipa
but
as
a
christmas
alebrown
ale
it
doesnt
fit
the
description
of
the
style
i
still
enjoy
this
and
will
review
it
as
is
there
is
a
brownlike
sourness
in
the
back
ground
so
its
a
hoppy
brown
ale
thats
pretty
drinkable
goes
down
good
overall
i
would
try
this
again
if
it
were
available
in
singles
and
new
couldnt
do
a
whole
six
pack
when
i
could
just
get
a
ipa
or
pale
ale
i
really
like
this
it
is
malty
as
can
be
for
a
beer
its
size
yet
there
is
plenty
of
hops
to
balance
however
i
keep
wishing
they
made
this
a
little
stronger
something
around
7
or
so
would
make
this
a
killer
strong
malty
ale
i
didnt
pick
up
any
spices
which
their
website
says
they
use
or
any
hints
of
chocolate
or
roast
which
i
expect
in
a
brown
ale
but
so
be
it
on
the
whole
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
better
than
average
holiday
style
ale
at
a
good
price
not
the
best
but
worth
a
try
in
that
its
a
christmas
ale
this
is
comparable
to
a
sled
ride
you
start
out
looking
down
the
hill
and
all
its
splendor
the
initial
ride
starts
nice
and
picks
up
speed
then
you
go
downhill
and
no
where
fast
looking
back
uphill
climb
same
thing
again
without
that
initial
rush
dont
get
me
wrong
its
tasty
and
i
recommend
it
but
it
is
a
steady
decline
from
start
to
finish
a
good
winter
warmer
but
not
in
the
league
of
a
sierra
nevada
celebration
or
a
great
lakes
christmas
ale
that
said
its
still
much
better
than
a
lot
of
cold
weather
beers
and
pairing
it
with
some
good
sharp
cheddar
or
a
cheese
soup
or
a
nice
hot
deli
or
bar
sandwich
would
probably
help
it
a
lot
to
balance
out
the
dead
spots
and
i
would
recommend
as
well
as
drink
it
again
certainly
worthy
of
enjoying
once
a
year
give
it
a
ride
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
ruby
brown
with
a
small
light
tan
head
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
sweet
and
spicy
malts
a
bit
of
hops
taste
is
pretty
nice
again
fruity
malts
lots
of
malt
backbone
chocolate
and
roasted
herbal
hops
spices
pretty
nice
good
body
too
pretty
decent
overall
nothing
special
for
a
winter
ale
though
this
beer
really
grew
on
me
this
was
the
last
beer
in
the
6pack
i
was
completely
turned
off
of
the
first
one
but
now
i
think
i
will
buy
another
6er
next
year
im
looking
forward
to
it
the
sum
is
greater
than
its
parts
d
very
good
winter
warmer
different
than
most
tasted
a
little
like
a
nut
brown
ale
full
bodied
and
mouthfeel
very
masculine
in
nature
good
balance
between
malt
and
hop
very
earthy
and
etheral
dry
however
the
malt
almost
creates
a
mirage
effect
of
sweetness
from
the
dark
burnt
toffee
very
good
and
drinkable
would
like
too
lay
a
few
of
these
down
and
see
what
happens
drinkability
was
very
nice
goes
down
smooth
and
crisp
i
dont
think
putting
a
christmast
logo
and
name
on
a
beer
makes
it
a
winter
warmer
so
im
disappointed
about
that
but
im
not
disappointed
in
the
beer
it
was
very
enjoyable
and
pretty
cheap
see
you
again
next
year
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
well
balanced
and
flavorful
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
cinnamon
and
spices
in
addition
to
the
caramel
in
the
aroma
smoky
malty
flavor
with
a
nice
spicyness
medium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
this
has
all
the
flavor
youre
looking
for
in
a
winter
warmer

is
a
nice
one

kick

and
also
a

in

not
enough
to
detract
from
its
better
qualities
medium

is
a

gis
website
claims
this
beer
is
similar
to
a
brown
ale
but
to
me
it
seems
more
like
a
hopped
up
porter
with
its
roasty
and
chocolate
flavors
a
great
nose
that
previews
the
flavors
that
follow
some
winter
beers
are
so
overpowering
that
i
have
to
switch
to
something
else
after
the
first
one
not
so
with
this
beer
i
could
and
did
have
several
in
one
night
the
brewery
claims
this
beer
can
be
stored
for
up
to
five
years
but
the
relatively
low
abv

suggests
otherwise
tis
the
season
for
christmas
ales
i
was
excited
to
try
goose
islands
christmas
ale
its
been
a
year
or
two
since
i
last
had
it
drank
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
a
101606
packagedon
date
pours
a
lovely
ruby
red
with
a
medium
tan
head
excellent
retention
smells
of
sweet
toasted
malt
bread
caramel
hints
of
citrus
maybe
orange
clove
cinnamon
plus
some
nice
piny
hops
warm
and
spicy
the
taste
surprised
me
as
the
hops
really
come
into
play
the
spices
and
malt
are
present
at
the
beginning
of
the
taste
but
the
hops
bloom
on
the
middle
and
back
of
the
tongue
very
good
mouthfeel
just
right
for
a
winter
warmer
medium
thickness
that
complements
the
flavors
a
highly
drinkable
beer
excellent
example
of
the
style
drinkability
this
is
very
good
and
entirely
sessionable
and
would
be
so

any
time
of
the
year

overly
spiced
beers
goose

christmas
ale
was
rubybrown
in
color
with
good
clarity
the
light

head
was
thick

left
sheets
of

behind
the
aroma
was
full
of
holiday
spices
and
sweet

the
taste
was
dark

toasty
with
some
holiday
spices
and
a
dry
finish
the
body
was
mediumfull
with
just
less
than
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
this
was
a
good
christmas
ale
that
is
not
as
heavy
on
the
spices
as
some
others
i
have
tried

a
nice

the
taste
is
very
nice
of
malts
and
toffee
the
finish
is
kinda
dry
medium

very
drinkable
would
recommed
for
sure
another
great
beer
from
gi
thanks
jhammerly
for
this
one
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
for
a
winter
warmer
easy
to
drink
but
not
impressive
will
not
have
more
of
this
one
note
my
bottle
was
on
the
mixasix
shelf
and
was
left
over
from
last
season
the
goose
island
website
recomends
bottling
this
one
for
up
to
five
years
ill
have
to
pick
up
some
fresh
brews
and
see
how
they
compare
drinkablility
an
extremely
drinkable
seasonal
from
a
fine
brewery
out
of
the
windy
city
reccomended
pretty
good
i
had
a
second
one
of
these
and
id
have
it
again
had
on
draft
at
local
bar
down
town
chicago
pinky
nail
thin
head
with
thin
spider
web
lacing
the
body
was
a
rich
coffee
color
smelled
of
nice
aromatic
hops
chocolate
slightly
toasted
malt
the
flavor
was
nice
really
refreshing
and
drinkable
the
medium
sweet
dark
malt
balanced
very
well
with
mild
hop
bitterness
and
coupled
with
tasty
hints
of
chocolate
the
drinkability
on
this
is
great
especially
on
tap
totally
an
easy
going
tasty
seasonal
beer
i
mean
it¬ís
the
kind
of
no
frills
brew
you
can
drink
and
have
casual
conversation
over
needless
to
say
i
know
what
i¬íll
be
drinking
next
time
i
go
to
the
ex
checker
d
this
beer
has
a
smooth
dry
malt
note
with
a
nice
spicy
hop
finish
but
it
didnt
really
remind
me
of
a
winter
warmer
very
nice
average
beer
drinkability
is
high
here
and
this
6
pack
is
going
down
tonight
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
small
head
and
little
retention
or
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
malty
smell
to
it
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
matches
the
smell
very
malty
has
a
coffee
taste
to
it
toasty
and
not
too
bitter
you
can
definately
taste
the
spices
but
they
arent
overpowering
has
a
heavier
feel
in
the
mouth
and
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
too
special
my
favorite
of
the
style
would
have
to
be
the
great
lakes
christmas
ale
which
i
think
nothing
compares
to
poured

a

a

away
one
of
my

offerings
pours
a

a

the

residual
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
but
mostly
clean
at
5
4
abvi
doubt
this
is
suitable
to
age
for
5
years
nor
that
it
is
bottle
conditioned
as
the
label
states
the
spices
seem
a
bit
too
subdued
and
the
overall
flavor
is
borderline
bland
this
would
be
more
interesting
with
a
greater
malthopspice
depth
and
consequently
achive
a
higher

no
light
passes
through
this
beer
at
all
nice
frothy
head
with
lots
of
lacing
smells
pretty
malty
sweet
flavorful
and
pleasing
to
the
palate
i
dont
know
what
to
compare
the
taste
to
the
mouthfeel
seems
kind
of
thin
for
such
a
robust
beer
not
knowing
a
whole
lot
about
winter
warmers
id
say
this
is
probably
slightly
above
average
this
is
an
easy
enough
to
drink
ale
will
be
interesting
to
see
just
how
the
flavours
continue
to
develop
and
evolve
a
good
session
brew
for
the
holidays
and
a
good
crossover
brew
for
introducing
novices
in
beer
appreciation
to
sarker
and
spicier
offerings
i
cant
wait
untill
january
to
see
this
one
again
im
buying
a
case
a
nice
onefinger
head
stays
firm
some
thick
lacing
hung
around
but
i
was
swirling
alot
very
intense
hop
flavor
with
sweet
malt
being
the
lesser
flavor
on
the
palate
a
nice
froth
sweetened
the
brew
and
released
some
more
malt
flavors
this
is
a
2005
and
is
still
very
complex
there
is
alot
packed
in
there
that
still
needs
to
age
and
mellow
still
a
good
beer
and
could
be
a
wonderful
winter
warmer
if
drunk
when
new
cheers
purchased
in
bottle
in
menomonee
falls
wi
this
beer
poured
an
opaque
dark
tone
it
smelled
of
chocolate
covered
hops
with
a
rather
unpleasant
hint
of
raw
sewage
there
was
definitely
something
odd
in
the
smell
the
taste
was
of
deeply
roasted
maltiness
along
with
a
hoppypiney
flavor
again
chocolate
lacings
the
mouthfeel
overall
was
thin
and
it
left
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
i¬ím
curious
to
try
letting
this
decent
beer
cellar
for
a
bit
next
time
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
is
full
flavored
and
comes
across
as
being
a
lot
bigger
than
it
is
it
is
roasty
a
bit
like
a
porter
but
remains
sweet
like
a
english
brown
ale
this
is
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
would
drink
again
this
is
a
rather
mediocre
beer
i
like
the
flavors
they
have
created
with
the
malt
but
they
railroaded
it
with
hops
i
would
love
to
see
more
focus
on
the
malt
less
hops
and
finish
a
little
less
dry
mouthfeeldrinkability
really
good
mouthfeel
but
the
taste
kills
the
drinkability
points
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
again
i
really
like
this
beer
caught
somewhere
between
a
porter
ipa
and
holiday
ale
its
a
beer
i
could
sip
by
the
fire
on
xmas
eve
till
santa
comes
down
the
chimney
then
id
share
one
with
him
quite
surprised
i
actually
found
this
ontap
in
the
area
but
this
club
is
known
for
having
one
goose
island
draft
at
all
times
the
nose
is
big
time
hops
with
a
hint
of
spices
the
malt
creeps
in
as
well
with
a
caramel
character
that
holds
the
whole
thing
together
this
is
light
enough
to
be
highly
drinkable
but
has
a
bunch
of
flavor
and
can
be
enjoyed
all
night
i
had
a
couple
of
them
ondraft
and
was
really
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
it
thinnish
for
a
winter
offering
but
its
nice
to
have
a
punch
of
hops
in
the
middle
of
the
holiday
season
definitely
worth
a
try
as
a
winter
warmer
it
really
isnt
warming
tasty
sure
as
hell
it
is
the
spice
might
get
to
me
after
a
few
and
since
this
doesnt
warm
it
might
take
a
few
it
almost
seems
like
they
just
threw
in
some
spice
to
an
apa
not
bad
perse
but
there
are
better
wws
out
there
that
fit
the
style
better
imo
i
have
to
say
this
one
impressed
me
sure
it
was
thinner
than
other
warmers
but
it
had
all
of
the
flavor
good
stuff
goose
mouthfeel
is
slightly
bitter
with
a
sugary
malt
that
is
very
light
yum
paired
well
with
sharp
cheddar
and
crackers
cheers
drinkability
nicely
drinkable
this
can
be
considered
a
comfort
beer
in
the
cold
weather
without
being
an
strong
alcohol
or
heavy
bodied
bomb
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
ale
most
likely
wouldnt
drink
this
if
it
wasnt
a

sense
one
will
surely
be

christmas
beer
overall
a
nice
example
of
a
christmas
beer
that
uses
spices
effectively
without
letting
them
get
out
of
control
verdict
not
goose
islands
best
offering
it
has
some
appealing
flavors
but
its
too
thinbodied
to
be
exceptional
aroma
of
dark
caramel
sweet
citrusy
fruit
piney
hops
spruce
essence
and
hints
of
roasted
barley
a
year
in
the
cellar
has
reduced
hop
bitterness
that
would
have
balance
the
caramel
and
biscuit
other
malts
light
body
medium
mouthfeel
finishes
lightly
sweet
this
ale
would
benefit
from
more
body
the
bloodhound
factor
neither
hound
seemed
interested
same
feeling
as
their
master
a
rich
caramel
coffee
slides
into
a
quite
bitter
finish
this
is
clearly
wellmade
beer
but
the
alcohol
makes
itself
a
little
too
wellknown
for
my
tastes
i
will
probably
stow
one
of
these
and
come
back
to
it
in
a
year
a
fine
crack
at
a
winter
warmer
the
back
informs
that
this
one
can
be
laid
down
for
up
to
5
years
and
i
bet
giving
it
a
year
would
really
bring
the
flavors
together
not
too
heavy
real
malty
and
medium
carbonation
but
with
the
warming
alcohol
and
slick
malt
balance
ends
up
as
a
brew
where
1
wouldnt
be
enough
and
6
would
be
the
max
this
one
is
just
ok
not
the
best
goose
island
beer
ive
had
another
good
winter
warmer
for
the
cold
weather
outside
this
is
my
second
beer
from
goose
island
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
their
other
offerings
d
this
beer
isnt
particularly
amazing
but
overall
it
adds
up
to
a
great
beer
the
spice
is
subtle
unlike
many
other
christmas
ales
that
ive
had
and
at
10
99
for
a
12
pack
this
has
quickly
become
my
session
beer
for
the
season
12
ounce
bottle
sampled
just
missed
this
one
on
tap
at
the
blind
tiger
rats
bottled
on
dating
bottled
less
then
a
month
ago
and
label
tells
me
this
will
continue
to
develop
over
5
years
anyway
this
is
a
good
looking
and
good
tasting
winter
brew
dark
honey
almond
in
color
with
a
long
lasting
tan
head
leaves
gobs
of
fine
lacing
nose
is
bready
malts
and
light
spice
malty
smooth
brew
pleasingly
flavorful
and
satisfying
with
notes
of
caramel
oatmeal
cookies
softly
rounded
on
the
tongue
very
nice
christmaswinter
sessioner
nice
solid
brew
deep
malt
backbone
light
hop
bitterness
that
is
just
present
enough
to
keep
you
thirsty
for
more
slender
sand
head
mildly
clingy
caramel
is
the
overriding
aroma
coffee
with
caramel
syrup
makes
up
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
slightly
smoky
orange
peal
finish
this
is
a
concrete
beer
with
a
great
price
it¬ís
really
quite
a
steal
the
mouth
is
creamy
upfront
but
turns
bitter
and
dry
as
the
hops
take
over
very
sessionable
this
beer
reminds
me
of
another
hoppy
winter
seasonal
snca
very
easy
to
drink
if
only
there
was
a
little
higher
abv
12
ounce
bottle
goose
island
christmas
ale
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
close
to
the
color
of
cola
the
one
inch
head
fades
rapidly
nutty
aroma
with
grassy
hops
and
spice
malty
flavor
with
cocoa
and
spices
a
little
astringent
hoppier
than
i
expected
i
enjoy
the
malty
flavor
in
this
beer
and
its
not
over
spiced
like
so
many
other
winter
beers
mouthfeel
is
medium
the
balance
and
the
small
bubble
carbonation
make
this
beer
quite
drinkable
good
version
notes
the
description
of
this
years
batch
claims
that
it
is
based
upon
an
ipa
recipe
while
the
hops
here
are
present
i
think
the
dark
malts
have
overwhelmed
the
hop
flavors
and
aromas
this
is
a
tasty
beer
definately
session
style
better
on
draft
than
in
the
bottle
overall
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
chirstmas
party
if
kegs
were
available
i
could
easily
see
this
being
the
beer
for
the
evening
drinkability
this
a
good
brew
to
sit
a
kick
back
on
a
cold
day
or
night
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
i
could
ask
for
something
a
bit
heavier
for
a
winter
warmer
but
this
is
a
damn
good
drinkable
beer
it
is
a
christmas
flavored
beer
with
the
spirit
of
a
lawnmower
summer
beer
medium
bodied
and
delicious
this
is
one
of
goose
islands
finest
brews
taste
improves
greatly
when
less
cold
chocolate
hints
and
a
touch
of
molasses
ring
through
more
hoppy
finish
very
drinkable
smooth
and
rich
definitely
worth
a
try
a
nice
nose
of
currants
and
raisins
when
poured
the
usual
thin
head
but
that¬ís
not
important
deep
dark
red
with
a
scotchlike
malt
profile
some
smokiness
of
cigar
tobacco
and
old
chair
leather
slight
touch
of
holiday
spiciness
but
not
overdone
like
other
holiday
beers
in
fact
it
may
come
entirely
from
the
yeast
and
hops
a
very
fine
beer
impression
i
think
the
beer
wants
to
be
a
porter
when
it
grows
up
but
still
prefer
it
to
most
brown
ales
that
i
have
tried
not
goose
islands
best
pours
a
very
mahogony
with
some
red
tinting
and
a
thin
whiteish
head
about
the
color
of
cola
maybe
a
little
darker
aroma
of
yeast
bread
sweet
caramel
with
some
citrous
taste
is
pretty
malty
but
balance
by
some
citric
and
almost
lemony
bitterness
starts
off
chocolately
and
roasted
moving
to
caramel
and
some
other
sweetness
a
little
spice
is
perceived
before
moving
into
the
bittering
hops
this
is
a
good
fairly
easy
drinking
winter
brew
even
though
i
am
drinking
this
in
april
chestnut
brown
with
caramel
highlights
where
light

through
a
thick
oneinch
high

head
rises
up
quickly
and
hangs
out
for
a
while
slowly
falling
down
to
a
thin
lacey
cap
that
rises
up
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
smell

and
intense
drawing
me
closer
dark
roasty

brown
sugar
and

just
a
bit
of
bitter
chocolate
full
and
chewy
mouthfeel
ushers
in
a
rich
flavor
of
powdery
cocoa
some
tangy
raisin
caramel
and
toffee
perhaps
a
hint
of
cherry
slightly
hoppy
tingly
finish
dry
and
crisp
a
bit
tannic
interesting
winter
warmer
a
little
lower
abv
than
others
ive
had
but
a
very
enjoyable
beer
easily
one
of
their
best
brews
pretty
drinkable
and
approrpiate
for
a
seasonal
spiced
beer
12oz
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
clear
caramel
color
mine
had
very
little
head
on
it
the
aroma
is
a
little
nutty
and
spicy
as
well
as
having
some
roasted
malts
in
there
the
taste
is
somewhat
roasty
nutty
spicy
with
a
little
hopiness
thrown
in
the
background
a
nice
brew
drinkability
highly
drinkable
worth
repeating
drinkability
and
overall
im
not
a
winter
warmer
fan
and
this
wasnt
bad
at
all
tasty
and
not
too
strong
and
overpowerful
the
spiciness
towards
the
end
really
started
to
bother
me
and
made
me
not
want
to
drink
another
one
that
much
a
simple
solid
brew
note
it
is
much
better
ontap
i
need
to
review
it
drinkability
a
very
well
balanced
and
thought
out
beer
well
made
although
one
would
not
to
imbibe
too
many
at
a
setting
and
od
the
beer
pours
a
deep
garnet
topped
with
a
thick
taupe
head
great
lacing
leaving
rings
all
the
way
down
the
glass
great
clarity
the
aroma
features
rich
cocoa
tinged
caramel
with
a
girth
of
herbal
citric
aromatic
hops
i
was
expecting
spices
but
theres
nothing
aside
from
real
unadulterated
beer
the
first
sip
reveals
a
milder
malt
base
flecked
thoroughly
with
coffee
diminishing
quickly
before
the
hops
a
bittersweet
mocha
flavor
shrinks
into
the
finish
overtaken
by
citric
herbal
hopping
nice
and
hoppy
in
the
finish
the
bitterness
more
than
enough
to
balance
the
malt
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
powdery
dry
cocoa
malt
flavor
yum
id
be
happy
with
a
sixer
of
this
i
wouldnt
last
very
long
i
tell
you
wut
beer
is
good
happy
winter
ale
beering
mouthfeel
has
a
good
body
and
creaminess
a
pleasure
to
consume
i
could
easily
sit
down
to
a
sixer
of
this
on
a
cold
winter
night
just
a
damn
fine
brew
and
a
must
try
from
goose
island
no
noticable
difference
from
the
draft
version
these
bottles
should
age
well
for
a
couple
of
years
this
is
quite
tasty
but
it
seems
a
little
harsh
in
the
finish
i
will
have
to
try
a
couple
more
of
these
especially
since
this
one
started
out
5
to
10
degrees
too
cold
goose
island
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
i
must
admit
im
a
bit
dissapointed
with
this
years
christmas
ale
while
it
is
most
definately
not
a
bad
brew
it
just
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
palate
is
a
wonderful
combination
of
pine
and
malt
with
citrus
and
bitters
that
will
surely
complement
any
holiday
feast
i
have
to
say
im
disappointed
with
this
offering
from
gi
there
are
better
more
warming
beers
of
this
style
out
there
while
not
a
bad
brew
i
wouldnt
buy
again
unless
part
of
a
pub
pack
spice
beer
without
noticeable
spice
in
taste
malty
including
a
degree
of
chocolate
malt
and
chocolate
syrup
nice
brown
appearance
with
lace
good
carbonation
nothing
too
special
and
par
for
this
brewery
thanks
woolfs
at
doug
shoemaker
super
tasting
overall
a
fine
ale
one
which
could
find
a
place
at
my
table
year
round
not
just
at
the
holidays
but
then
what
fun
would
that
be
the
label
says
flavor
will
continue
to
develop
over
five
years
id
better
sttock
up
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
one
finger
of
light
tan
head
there
is
minimal
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
nutty
almost
smells
exactly
like
a
nut
brown
bits
of
caramel
and
toffee
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
more
caramel
and
nut
flavors
coming
through
sweet
at
first
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
a
well
rounded
winter
warmer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
like
i
said
i
dont
care
for
the
heavy
spice
hitters
so
this
is
a
nice
break
from
all
that
final
thought
this
is
a
wonderful
seasonal
by
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
this
country
notes
this
tasted
very
fresh
and
raw
to
me
which
i
guess
it
should
since
the
bottle
states
it
was
born
on
102504
im
interested
to
see
how
the
aging
will
affect
this
finely
crafted
beer
this
holiday
beer
is
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
thin
dark
beige
head
that
dissapeared
pretty
fast
thin
stringy
lacing
the
aroma
is
pleasantly
roasty
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
spice
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
hard
to
categorize
as
it
has
elements
of
a
belgian
and
an
alt
fruit
malt
spice
and
caramel
flavors
are
all
there
the
finish
is
sweet
fruit
with
a
touch
of
hops
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
holidays
on
tap
at
the
wrigleyville
location
definately
my
favorite
winter
warmer
ive
had
to
date
and
ive
sampled
a
few
in
my
day
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
hues
and
just
a
coat
of
head
over
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
was
very
deep
caramel
with
notes
of
coffee
there
was
deep
deep
hop
in
there
damn
it
smells
good
the
flavor
was
great
full
of
huge
flavors
big
well
blended
hop
big
caramel
sweetness
and
hints
of
coffee
i
love
it
the
feel
was
big
and
thick
coating
my
mouth
the
beer
is
overall
very
good
its
easydrinking
and
smooth
goes
down
without
hesitation
just
like
i
want
it
to
be
good
but
not
great
fairly
drinkable
other
than
that
lingering
bitterness
the
color
is
a
nice
brown
with
some
redness
the
head
is
tan
and
thick
but
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
baking
spices
it
tastes
like
it
smells
nice
and
malty
not
bitter
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
this
is
a
very
good
extremely
drinkable
beer
this
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
large
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
small
coffee
smell
and
a
nice
spicy
character
nutmeg
maybe
the
flavor
is
of
roasted
maltscoffee
a
small
amount
of
fruit
and
plenty
of
spices
nice
and
balanced
medium
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability

comments
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
that
i
have
had
this
past
winter
i
may
have
only
had
one
bottle
of
this
great
brew
but
given
the
opportunity
i
would
drink
plenty
of
more
thanks
again
to
chilidog
for
the
great
brew
the
pour
provided
a
ruby
color
with
basically
no
head
a
little
disappointing
smell
was
of
fruit
and
maybe
some
spices
but
i
thought
this
wasnt
supposed
to
be
spiced
taste
was
unintruding
and
quite
simple
but
good
as
well
slightly
sweet
flavors
of
caramel
and
coffee
upfront
grainy
in
the
middle
and
alcohol
tasting
towards
the
end
the
body
was
too
thin
for
my
liking
but
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
not
really
a
christmas
ale
in
the
traditional
sense
but
something
i
would
go
back
to
again
thanks
crjm
drinkability
these
were
a
pleasure
to
drink
very
enjoyable
and
a
nice
surprise
to
find
tucked
away
in
my
storage
well
after
santa
had
retreated
northward
this
goose
pours
a
clear
red
mahogany
with
a
thin
beige
head
that
quickly
fades
into
even
lacing
of
patches
and
sheets
aroma
begins
with
caramel
with
a
spice
background
then
evolves
into
a
prominent
bouquet
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
mouthfeel
has
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mild
spicy
bite
on
the
tongue
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
caramel
malt
with
cinamon
and
nutmeg
in
the
background
as
it
warms
up
there
seems
to
be
an
abundance
of
fresh
green
hops
that
lend
a
citrus
balance
ive
gotten
this
fresh
green
hoppiness
from
other
goose
island
brews
as
well
and
find
it
very
pleasant
well
balanced
overall
and
has
very
good
drinkability
for
a
christmas
seasonal
ale
due
to
the
restrained
use
of
the
spices
this
is
an
average
to
above
average
beer
that
can
now
occupy
considerable
shelf
space
in
my
fridge
because
i
was
able
to
find
it
for
9
99
per
12pack
thats
a
bargain
appearance
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
nice
moccha
colored

not
bad
aroma

with
hints
of
nutmeg
and
other
christmas
spice
deep

toastiness
seems
winter
warming
to
me
hast
the
right

a
nice

presence
rides
a
wave
of
toasted
malts
with
hints
of
spice
and
chocolate
making
for
an
enjoyable
holiday
inspired
ride
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
bodied
ale
with
mellow
carbonation
to
form
an
interesting
mouthfeel
and
nice
smooth
but
syrupy
texture
drinkability
the
piney
earthy
flow
found
in
the
middle
of
the
malt
wave
is
most
impressive
keeps
my
taste
buds
wanting
more
christmas
ale
is
another
solid
offering
from
goose
island
but
ive
had
better
wintertime
brews
ill
have
no
trouble
at
all
waiting
until
next
holdiay
season
to
drink
it
again
this
is
one
of
their
best
offerings
thanks
for
the
late
xmas
present
bighuge
nice
one
it
poured
dark
amber
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
laced
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
smelled
lightly
of
citrusyflowery
hops
the
taste
matched
the
citrusy
flowery
aroma
but
had
a
distinctly
more
bitter
flavor
it
starts
to
finish
with
a
nutty
malt
flavor
but
completely
finishes
with
more
of
the
bitter
hop
tones
a
nice
beer
but
not
one
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
for
some
reason
it
seems
quite
guinnessy
at
times
i
think
that
the
abv
is
a
nice
touch
at
5

this
beer
is
very
sessionable
and
ive
danced
with
that
the
last
three
nights
the
more
you
get
down
you
start
to
get
a
bit
annoyed
by
the
slight
sweetbitterness
character
of
the
beer
but
overall
quite
good
11004really
getting
some
brown
sugar
notes
on
the
nose
and
buds
tasty
downgraded
scores
slightly
after
having
several
more
stil
lvery
good
pours
a
red
brown
color
with
a
medium
sized
head
smells
deeply
of
piney
hops
the
taste
is
not
quite
what
id
expect
for
a
spiced
holiday
beer
theres
very
little
spice
that
i
notice
maybe
a
dash
of
cinammon
or
nutmeg
but
mostly
this
tastes
like
an
average
version
of
an
ipa
because
theres
plenty
of
hops
in
this
beer
id
be
curious
to
taste
this
next
to
the
goose
island
ipa
and
see
if
i
can
notice
a
difference
by
the
time
i
finish
ive
parsed
out
the
taste
a
bit
more
first
comes
a
round
slightly
creamy
and
medicinal
flavor
with
a
hint
of
cherry
quickly
the
carbonation
kicks
in
the
finish
is
bitterly
tangy
smoky
and
again
slightly
medicinal
at
the
end
i
realize
that
a
vaguely
syrupy
apricotplum
flavor
presides
over
most
of
the
taste
this
is
quite
an
impressive
christmas
offering
and
the
second
goose
island
beer
im
desperately
hoping
to
find
in
bottles
found
this
at
a
favorite
eastside
pizzaria
of
all
places
cant
tell
if
this
beer
is
superbly
integrated
or
just
too
muddled
well
settled
brew
with
a
mild
herbal
tea
and
fake
caramel
not
terribly
well
spiced
as
far
as
i
can
tell
derives
a
lot
of
flavor
from
roasted
malts
bready
caramel
chocolate
but
theyre
not
really
distinct
flavors
or
even
significant
impressions
its
more
of
a
stew
of
flavors
finishes
with
a
unique
hop
footprint
and
a
maltdriven
sweetness
the
same
reddishbrown
color
my
friend
johnnyp
describes
so
perfectly
dull
beig
head
bubbles
and
fades
quickly
with
a
slight
hint
of
ruby
along
the
edges
the
aromas
is
a
hodgepodge
of
spices
nutmeg
hints
of
cinnamon
and
musty
earthyness
to
it
tastes
are
along
the
same
lines
but
muddled
dusty
shoe
leather
treated
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
flavors
are
muddled
and
earthy
they
dont
seem
very
crisp
and
none
really
stand
out
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
they
just
tried
to
do
too
much
with
the
flavors
on
this
one
this
poured
into
the
glass
with
a
color
that
resembled
dark
brown
leather
the
head
disappeared
fairly
quickly
as
far
as
smell
goes
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
coming
out
of
a
christmasstyle
ale
there
were
tiny
hints
of
nutmeg
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
coriander
goose
island
is
a
very
good
brewery
but
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
out
of
this
brew
it
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
alone
but
since
i
love
winter
beers
this
one
wasnt
the
best
of
the
season
happy
honkerdays
this
is
a
dark
beverage
with
an
amber
hue
coming
through
the
majority
of
it
it
smells
like
a
bundle
of
stuff
leaving
me
with
a
candylike
scent
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
the
taste
i
like
the
well
blended
in
hops
that
hits
my
tounge
first
its
got
some
sweet
malty
elements
candy
like
and
other
spices
are
involved
id
say
give
this
goose
a
try
ng
piney
with
light
hop
aroma
predominant
rich
malt
smell
too
light
small
carbonation
throughout
though
seems
a
bit
prickly
when
held
in
mouth
for
extended
period
slight
carmel
taste
as
warms
some
have
reported
it
as
watery
though
mine
seemed
to
have
a
pretty
average
mouthfeel
swished
to
the
back
of
the
mouthtongue
a
citrus
hop
taste
peaked
through
until
the
ultimate
swallow
really
a
nice
beer
will
be
buying
the
2003
release
i
would
expect
it
to
be
a
good
beer
to
offer
in
a
group
setting
nice
red
brown
color
beer
smells
spicy
floral
with
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
tastes
very
full
and
delicious
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
to
finish
off
the
flavor
one
of
the
best
winter
brews
i
have
tried
give
goose
island
a
try
if
you
havent
ever
carbonation
is
perfect
for
style
and
the
drinkablity
is
very
good
i
decent
looking

deep

dense

there
as
well

less
impressive
smoky

dry
good
mouthfeel
medium

nothing
exceptional
but
a
decent
brew
drinkabilty
this
beer
has
gotten
smokier
over
the
years
i
remember
it
being
a
lot
more
sweet
maltiness
and
very
little
smokiness
not
one
of
my
favorite
holiday
beers
anymore
but
still
worth
a
try
if
you
can
i
thought
this
beer
was
too
heavy
and
too
filling
not
enough
jollyness
or
christmas
cheer
not
bad
though
good
deep
chestnut
color
accompanied
by
a
very
ample
head
that
features
very
solid
lace
quite
roasted
aromatics
with
some
chocolate
coffee
and
raisin
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
and
nicely
viscous
and
creamy
as
well
in
the
mouth
raosted
caramel
malt
raisin
and
decent
balancing
hop
finishes
with
a
touch
of
burnt
carmel
a
rather
solid
yet
not
awe
inspiring
goose
this
beers
appearance
consisted
of
a
small
sized
creamy
tan
head
with
finesmall
sized
bubbles
that
mostly
diminished
the
body
was
opaque
and
free
of
carbonation
with
a
brown
hue
the
nose
was
mildly
malty
with
caramel
notes
and
the
same
was
true
for
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
thin
and
watery
texture
and
medium
bodied
the
lacing
was
fair
this
beer
poured
a
dark
red
colour
with
a
nice
head
the
aromas
were
very
malty
and
spicy
with
some
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
was
the
same
as
the
aroma
malty
with
some
spices
and
hops
in
the
background
as
well
im
not
sure
what
gi
are
trying
to
go
for
with
this
brew
but
whatever
they
are
attempting
to
do
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
little
holiday
brew
that
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
a
good
drinkability

have
favored

with
that

is

up

dissipates

of
big
hops
maybe
slightly
thin
in
body
another
of
six
or
so
winter
beers
that
will
give
me
plenty
of
variety
for
my
moods
this
holiday
season
pours
a
nearly
clear
amber
with
some
tones
of
red
for
the
season
well
call
them
cranberry
head
is
minimal
but
laces
nicely
crisp
warm
scent
that
hints
of
pie
spices
those
tones
are
less
strong
in
the
taste
than
one
might
expect
but
goose
island
gets
it
right
again
with
a
wellintegrated
brew
smooth
sweet
start
with
a
hoppy
middle
and
warm
finish
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
as
well
a
very
nice
christmas
offering
pours
out
to
a
dark
ruby
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
had
a
slight
yeast
smell
to
it
with
light
fruit
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
slight
plum
taste
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
evening

with

not

i

been
spoiled

o
excellent
brown
ale
that
is
extremely
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
overall
brought
a
4pack
of
cans
home
from
mn
wasnt
a
big
fan
after
the
first
two
cans
last
two
cans
grew
on
me
very
similar
to
bells
best
brown
ale
but
i
do
prefer
that
one
to
this
one
not
too
shabby
though
onice
flavor
and
balance
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
session
beer
overall
a
nice
brown
ale
but
it
was
a
little
too
light
on
the
body
for
me
a
little
more
really
could
have
let
the
darker
tones
showcase
themselves
more
and
add
some
complexity
but
this
is
an
easy
drinker
with
some
really
nice
malty
tones
o
wow
really
good
brown
ale
ive
had
this
before
but
i
enjoyed
it
even
more
this
time
around
definitely
a
must
try
i
cant
wait
for
another
in
the
end
the
beer
has
an
extremely
light
body
the
notes
dont
quite
fire
for
a
substantial
brown
ale
this
is
a
great
beer
i
could
definitely
have
more
when
im
looking
for
a
malt
bomb
that
is
creamy
and
refreshing
perhaps
the
most
traditional
beer
surly
has
brewed
its
definitely
my
favorite
brown
ale
brewed
in
the
country
of
all
the
malt
forward
beers
surly
has
played
around
with
this
is
definitely
their
most
successful
surly
bender
45
odnot
as
aggressive
as
i
was
expecting
but
i
did
enjoy
it
a
bit
overrated
here
in
my
opinion
its
highpoint
would
definitely
be
its
drinkability
bottom
line
always
worth
a
try
since
it
hits
about
10
different
beer
styles
that
said
id
get
a
draft
or
a
single
can
over
a
4pk
unless
youre
really
into
browns
or
surly
and
cant
get
it
easily
in
your
area
overall
a
good
example
of
what
a
brown
ale
could
be
the
dark
bread
notes
with
that
nutty
sweetness
and
coffee
were
a
stand
out
for
me
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
more
body
though
overall
well
put
together
recommend
to
all
brown
ale
lovers
and
haters
yum
seek
it
out
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
one
offwhite
head
smell
is
roasted
malts
carmel
coffee
and
chocolate
not
a
very
strong
nose
taste
is
creamy
roasted
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
slight
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
mid
to
low
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
could
drink
this
one
regularly
not
as
good
as
everything
else
ive
had
from
the
surly
line
up
possibly
their
weakest
entry
however
thats
not
really
a
bad
praise
since
surlys
line
up
is
rather
fantastic
id
say
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
but
recommend
going
straight
to
the
coffee
bender
o
4
755
ive
never
drank
a
perfect
beer
but
coming
from
an
ipa
guy
this
comes
damn
close
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
moderate
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malts
and
biscuit
followed
by
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
great
earthy
aroma
roasted
malt
hits
the
palate
first
followed
up
by
a
sweet
oat
flavor
reminiscent
of
brown
sugar
on
hot
oatmeal
very
smooth
and
complex
oats
give
this
brown
ale
a
thick
rich
mouthfeel
great
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
finishes
dry
and
slightly
bitter
overall
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
is
almost
black
actually
had
a
1finger
tan
head
that
lasted
a
bit
lots
of
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
of
roasted
malt
hits
your
nose
up
front
with
a
slight
coffee
smell
the
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
with
some
sweet
spice
and
very
smooth
went
down
very
easy
overall
it
was
great
and
hense
a
2nd
tasting
16
oz
was
needed
an
outstanding
look
with
dank
dark
coffee
brown
hue
a
stubborn
light
tan
head
and
an
incredible
sheet
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
subtle
but
certainly
delivers
very
pleasant
caramel
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
grass
hops
the
flavor
comes
on
nicely
with
much
more
malt
and
a
smooth
coffee
blend
i
get
some
grass
hop
edges
and
taffy
sweetness
along
the
lines
of
circus
peanuts
but
its
all
quite
tasteful
and
makes
got
a
classic
american
brown
ale
the
body
is
solidly
medium
with
modest
carbonation
and
a
slightly
chalky
feel
solid
stuff
t
a
nice
mix
of
toasted
malt
and
light
roasted
coffee
with
a
nice
trace
of
earthy
hops
lingering
in
the
back
finish
brings
some
brown
sugar
oats
and
hazelnut
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
and
carries
all
the
flavors
really
nicely
a
really
great
brown
maybe
the
best
ive
had
on
the
real
tip
surly
continues
to
impress
me
with
every
single
beer
they
put
out
ipa
awesome
douple
ipa
amazing
imperial
stout
fabulous
helles
lager
exemplary
brown
ale
yup
damn
delicious
i
can
say
that
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
brown
ales
that
ive
had
and
certainly
one
of
the
most
memorable
i
would
definitely
revisit
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
but
ive
gotta
work
on
getting
some
coffee
bender
first
o
somewhere
between
an
american
brown
and
porter
with
a
malt
flavors
and
hops
bitterness
dominating
reviewed
33008
overall
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
but
not
my
preferred
interpretation
an
enjoyable
beer
and
likely
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
brown
ale
in
the
5
percent
range
without
flavor
additives
o
a
refreshing
interesting
beer
well
done
a
top
of
the
line
brown
ale
a
malty
experience
with
a
soft
hop
profile
to
give
it
a
bit
more
character
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
i
expect
that
from
surly
and
from
style
it
shows
character
more
than
lack
of
skill
i
love
tracking
this
down
from
time
to
time
o
great
brown
ale
i
enjoy
coffee
bender
a
touch
more
but
this
is
still
top
notch
o
not
your
typical
brown
ale
almost
drinks
like
a
porter
nice
chocolate
flavors
with
some
good
herbal
hop
notes
to
balance
one
of
the
better
ive
tried
of
the
style
a
really
nice
brown
ale
moving
in
that
more
hoppy
direction
a
real
marker
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
the
pour
is
chocolate
syrup
in
color
but
not
nearly
as
thick
only
a
little
light
comes
through
and
there
is
a
foamy
head
the
color
of
oatmeal
that
rises
up
maybe
three
inches
and
leaves
good
lacing
as
it
drinks
the
nose
is
bitter
cocoa
and
bitter
hops
maybe
with
a
touch
of
pine
to
them
there
is
also
a
slight
smoky
aroma
from
the
roasted
barley
malt
that
gives
this
more
of
a
fall
than
spring
beer
aura
to
me
the
flavor
is
big
lots
happening
for
a
brown
piney
pitchy
sappy
hops
first
which
fade
into
a
bitterness
that
is
more
malt
driven
the
cocoa
element
carries
over
from
the
nose
but
sweetens
up
just
enough
to
counteract
the
bitter
and
the
finish
is
long
and
luxurious
exacerbated
by
the
wonderfully
full
body
creamy
texture
and
soft
carbonation
of
this
beer
to
be
able
to
have
this
and
sixpoints
diesel
in
such
close
succession
was
a
real
treat
even
though
they
call
that
one
a
stout
these
are
probably
the
best
two
american
brown
ales
going
at
the
moment
this
is
sensationally
good
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
nice
combination
of
sweet
hoppiness
with
the
dark
earthy
maltiness
typically
associated
with
porters
and
stouts
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
i
will
be
bringing
some
home
with
me
back
to
wisconsin
4
bender
pours
a
black
color
with
a
nice
large
white
lacing
head
there
was
a
unique
sweet
like
aroma
the
taste
had
mild
malt
flavorings
with
a
strange
candy
like
sweetness
that
followed
full
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
sweet
candy
like
brown
ale
o
really
delicious
brown
ale
i
just
returned
from
a
trip
to
florida
where
i
drank
a
lot
of
fresh
cigar
city
beers
including
their
maduro
brown
ale
at
first
taste
i
prefer
bender
this
only
heightens
my
jealousy
that
surlys
beers
are
largely
unattainable
for
me
o
a
solid
brown
ale
i
am
not
generally
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
its
well
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
thickness
likely
due
to
the
addition
of
oats
carbonation
is
of
mediumlow
intensity
leading
to
a
smooth
fairly
substantial
mouthfeel
with
light
flecks
of
carbonation
felt
across
the
palate
closes
quite
dry
almost
astringent
with
light
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
o
an
accomplished
brown
ale
that
rolls
around
the
tastebuds
and
is
deserving
of
the
high
ranking
it
has
accomplished
seems
to
me
to
be
the
kind
of
thing
youd
find
yourself
drinking
in
an
english
pub
albeit
a
quaff
a
bit
hoppier
and
more
forward
than
a
bitter
o
a
fine
tasty
mild
brown
ale
with
a
good
amount
of
subtle
gentle
flavor
to
it
the
coffee
bender
with
its
massive
infusion
of
big
coffee
flavor
is
better
but
this
is
a
nice
and
easydrinking
base
beer
overall
a
solid
representation
of
a
brown
ale
i
really
like
the
addition
of
the
oats
o
this
beer
really
blew
me
away
it
is
so
creamy
smooth
and
big
on
flavour
i
like
brown
ales
but
its
not
a
go
to
style
for
me
generally
but
this
beer
has
the
best
qualities
of
this
style
big
thanks
to
andrenaline
for
introducing
me
to
this
brewer
by
including
their
beer
in
our
recent
trades
o
this
beer
has
great
complexity
and
interesting
flavors
the
oats
lend
lots
of
smoothness
to
the
mouthfeel
o
very
tasty
brown
ale
nice
sweet
malts
roast
and
bitterness
to
balance
this
beer
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
really
nice
rich
flavors
and
the
added
benefit
of
coming
in
a
can
which
makes
it
a
great
choice
for
tailgating
during
football
season
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
very
nice
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
are
top
notch
on
this
very
good
looking
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
roasted
aroma
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
is
sweet
upfront
a
little
creamy
there
is
a
roasted
nut
flavor
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
too
the
aftertaste
is
moderately
bitter
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
smooth
lightly
carbonated
and
highly
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
really
good
very
nice
brew
o
this
is
another
really
good
offering
from
surly
really
tasty
easy
drinking
this
brewery
has
really
impressed
me
i
wish
i
had
easier
access
to
their
beers
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
glad
to
recommend
pours
a
deep
deep
brown
with
nice
tan
head
oily
and
great
lacing
really
nice
chocolate
aromas
mixed
with
a
bit
of
toffee
and
some
slight
hoppy
aromas
even
a
bit
of
crispness
taste
is
very
nice
bitter
roasted
chocolate
deff
bitter
almost
like
baking
chocolate
hints
of
caramel
aftertaste
again
its
a
little
bitter
but
its
good
and
representative
of
the
style
great
brown
ale
which
shouldnt
be
passed
up
this
will
no
doubt
rank

this
is
an
excellent
brew
o
incredibly
tasty
brown
ale
loads
of
flavour
easy
drinking
and
easily
sessoinable
this
is
indeed
a
top
notch
brown
ale
od
a
nice
brown
noticable
but
not
overpowering
hop
contribution
adds
a
nice
element
a
nice
take
on
the
brown
style
thanks
to
ko
for
bringing
this
one
back
from
mn
dark
brown
in
color
with
amber
hues
and
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
thick
dense
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
that
left
wet
lacings
on
the
glass
dark
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
floral
hop
aromas
with
a
hint
of
coffee
on
the
back
end
oily
feel
up
front
with
assertive
carbonation
through
the
middle
and
a
bit
of
a
the
thin
watery
finish
dark
roasted
and
burnt
malt
flavors
up
front
with
chocolate
flavors
beneath
floral
hop
bitterness
through
the
middle
that
transition
to
toasted
malt
just
before
the
finish
finishes
crisply
with
a
lingering
charred
malt
and
hop
bitterness
a
very
worthy
beer
i
enjoyed
this
on
a
warm
summers
day
i
can
only
imagine
how
good
this
would
be
on
a
cool
winters
night
final
thoughts
surly
has
a
great
lineup
of
beers
as
is
usual
with
all
the
styles
they
make
bender
is
not
your
typical
brown
ale
its
more
hopassertive
and
hits
all
the
right
malt
notes
the
price
is
a
little
steep
but
definitely
one
to
buy
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
to
be
honest
its
a
style
that
seems
to
rarely
wow
at
all
but
this
beer
will
go
down
as
easily
as
any
no
matter
what
season
it
is
o
solid
but
something
seems
to
be
lacking
the
taste
is
there
but
has
a
bit
of
a
stale
finish
a
little
thicker
body
would
do
this
beer
well
too
oa
solid
brown
ale
having
coffee
bender
soon
which
hopefully
with
the
added
coffee
will
be
better
o
this
is
a
very
solid
example
of
a
brown
ale
truly
an
allnight
session
beer
not
my
personal
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
textbook
exemplar
o
very
nicely
balanced
flavor
and
thick
this
is
a
refreshing
brown
ale
that
gets
it
very
right
d
outstanding
brown
ale
taste
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
do
to
its
easy
taste
and
feel
flavors
and
scents
are
good
but
not
overwhelming
and
you
can
really
taste
all
the
ingredients
that
were
put
into
this
beer
fantastic
d
very
if
youve
never
had
it
please
do
osolid
all
around
beer
better
than
most
browns
that
i
have
had
o
perhaps
a
tainted
can
i
know
others
have
raved
about
this
but
for
me
it
just
wasnt
very
special
the
flavors
were
dull
and
the
beer
just
didnt
surprise
me
anywhere
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
sure
i
would
pick
it
over
a
new
castle
nearly
cola
colored
body
with
a
small
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
spotty
lacing
good
bready
maltiness
in
the
nose
grassy
european
hop
note
comes
through
on
the
back
end
tasty
and
smooth
brown
ale
with
a
nice
rich
malt
flavor
lots
of
chewy
smoothness
from
the
oatmeal
and
a
bit
of
a
bitter
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
hints
of
coffee
cocoa
and
subtle
roastiness
retains
a
good
deal
of
drinkability
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
despite
fairly
crisp
carbonation
refreshing
and
very
wellmade
quite
flavorful
for
an
often
bland
style
another
impressive
surly
offering
an
excellent
brown
ale
in
a
can
whats
not
to
like
o
i
didnt
realize
bender
existed
without
coffee
in
it
guess
i
should
have
done
my
research
this
was
the
definition
of
average
and
i
would
recommend
you
skip
it
o
an
iconic
brown
ale
that
deserves
a
spot
in
the
fridge
of
any
roasty
beer
fan
with
a
soft
spot
for
easy
drinking
brews
very
nice
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
one
finger
of
off
white
head
aroma
opens
up
with
some
roasted
malts
which
are
rounded
out
with
some
chocolate
toffee
and
caramel
notes
taste
is
more
of
the
same
and
gains
some
nuttiness
as
the
bitterness
kicks
in
extremely
smooth
and
very
easy
drinking
great
mouthfeel
overall
i
would
definitely
get
this
on
a
regular
basis
if
i
could
i
actually
prefer
this
to
coffee
bender
i
felt
like
i
could
taste
the
beer
more
in
this
one
doverall
this
was
a
good
brown
ale
nothing
exceptional
but
solid
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
but
this
is
def
a
good
base
beer
for
coffee
bender
i
would
recommend
trying
this
first
and
then
move
onto
coffee
bender
and
see
how
much
it
improves
imo
at
least
but
overall
a
nice
beer
o
this
one
was
pretty
damn
good
it
had
a
lot
of
flavor
but
it
remained
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
had
in
quite
awhile
o
a
very
good
brown
ale
great
malt
flavors
with
a
solid
hop
presence
even
though
brown
ales
are
never
my
first
choice
in
a
beer
this
one
was
pretty
decent
there
was
a
good
deal
of
flavors
coming
through
making
this
a
bit
less
boring
than
the
majority
of
ones
ive
come
across
im
pretty
excited
to
try
the
coffee
bender
now
considering
i
absolutely
love
coffee
flavored
beers
o
its
been
said
before
in
previous
reviews
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
the
world
needs
more
brown
ales
that
arent
nutbased
big
creamy
body
works
wonders
for
this
brew
solid
complexity
fresh
ingredients
well
executed
or
in
fewer
words
a
typical
beer
from
surly
o
a
lot
more
complex
than
most
brown
ales
a
regular
offering
for
me
i
cant
believe
it
took
so
long
for
me
to
review
this
o
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
at
all
definitely
one
that
id
order
at
a
bar
any
chance
i
got
if
it
were
sold
in
indiana
at
the
same
time
though
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
trade
for
again
im
curious
to
try
coffee
bender
next
o
pretty
much
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
drinkable
and
smooth
with
decent
flavor
and
nose
overall
is
very
high
never
expected
to
like
a
brown
ale
this
much
ever
again
this
is
so
much
more
interesting
than
an
average
brown
ale
there
is
some
room
for
improvement
but
it
is
a
great
accomplishment
i
would
drink
this
a
lot
if
i
could
get
more
o
brown
ales
are
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
but
i
do
enjoy
a
good
one
this
is
pretty
tasty
think
i
might
enjoy
it
more
in
the
fall
16
ounce

served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
that
you
can
see
through
some
when
held
up
to
a
light
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
that
stays
around
a
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
caramel
malt
vanilla
coffee
nuts
chocolate
and
some
light
hops
it
tastes
like
caramel

nuts
coffee
chocolate
and
some
hops
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
has
moderate
carbonation
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
i
liked
it
its
definitely
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
good
full
bodied
with
a
perfect
carbonation
level
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
its
pretty

glad
to
finally

this
beer
pours
with
a
nice
tight
light
head
that
leaves
very
nice
lacing
and
recedes
to
a
short
bit
of
tight
head
after
a
while
good
retention
aroma
is
light
roasty
a
bit
nutty
and
a
mild
bitter
chocolate
note
taste
is
similar
but
there
is
a
bit
of
a
lightness
and
mild
minerally
flavor
bitter
chocoate
is
also
absent
there
is
also
a
nice
biscuit
malt
flavor
overall
very
nice
beer
mouthfeel
could
use
a
bit
more
body
but
for
a
5
beer
the
lightness
is
not
really
too
much
of
an
issue
overall
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
probably
wouldnt
go
too
much
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
would
always
be
happy
to
see
this
beer
cost
12
for
a
four
pack
of
16
oz
cans
overall
this
was
by
far
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
probably
cracking
my
top
20
which
is
ridiculous
considering
its
a
brown
ale
d
overall
this
one
is
a
standout
as
far
as
brown
ales
go
really
a
treat
i
love
the
complexity
and
dryness
of
the
malt
with
the
subtle
smooth
hop
bitterness
adding
yet
another
layer
if
you
havent
had
this
beer
you
need
to
try
it
dr
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
but
for
my
first
surly
beer
its
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
coffee
is
a
strange
choice
for
a
wouldbe
brown
ale
pours
a
deep
clear
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
a
huge
fluffy
beige
head
sits
on
top
for
a
good
long
time
before
impaling
itself
to
the
sides
of
my
glass
smells
of
caramel
and
chocolate
mostly
with
some
vanilla
a
hint
of
nut
and
a
bit
of
earthy
hop
presence
taste
is
caramel
and
toffee
mostly
hints
of
butter
alcohol
and
a
slightly
earthy
citrus
hop
flavor
seems
a
bit
out
of
place
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
watery
mouthfeel
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
i
would
the
malt
bill
has
a
distinct
english
esb
meets
dark
mild
feel
to
it
while
it
also
seems
heavy
on
the
american
hops
for
a
brown
i
thought
the
flavors
clashed
a
little
bit
for
a
brew
with
oats
in
the
bill
i
would
have
expected
a
much
creamier
feel
than
this
beer
has
very
satisfied
by
this
surly
offering
a
lot
of
good
complexity
and
mouthfeel
for
a
beer
barely
over
5
also
a
decent
amount
of
subtle
hoppiness
for
a
brown
thanks
to
crass3000
for
this
one
a
good
brown
ale
different
with
the
coffee
aspect
and
better
for
it
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
different
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
second
time
having
it
but
im
more
eager
to
try
coffee
bender
maduro
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
here
in
fl
and
like
i
said
this
reminds
me
of
it
but
i
dont
know
if
id
drink
it
as
often
were
i
living
in
mn
pours
a
really
pure
dark
brown
with
a
nice
light
coffee
colored
two
finger
head
average
lacing
and
retention
not
getting
a
whole
lot
from
the
aroma
really
slight
notes
of
vanilla
coco
and
some
hop
oil
nice
subtle
balanced
flavor
semisweet
chocolate
nice
vanilla
notes
and
some
very
muted
nuttiness
toffee
and
caramel
slight
but
definitely
bittering
citrus
and
oily
pine
hops
close
this
one
out
not
a
stand
out
beer
but
very
nice
for
the
style
overall
a
decent
beer
overall
one
worth
trying
in
my
book
but
not
anything
that
knocked
my
socks
off
just
a
good
brown
ale
overall
quality
brown
ale
and
a
perfect
hit
for
style
would
drink
again
and
would
love
to
have
other
products
overall
this
a
very
dinkable
coffee
ale
surly
has
not
disappointed
yet
cant
wait
to
drink
more
from
them
cheers
i
simply
love
this
beer
i
feel
lucky
to
have
it
as
one
of
my
local
staples
ive
savored
it
many
times
and
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
it
its
a
classic
example
of
surlys
take
on
brewing
combining
elements
in
unusual
ways
to
create
unique
stylebending
fantastic
beers
o
this
beer
was
ok
none
of
the
flavors
were
great
none
too
unpleasant
wouldnt
buy
again
thought
it
was
nondescript
overall
this
is
a
fine
brew
that
i
would
buy
if
it
were
available
to
me
i
love
the
cans
love
the
look
love
the
lowish
abv
and
the
flavors
are
great
this
would
be
a
welcome
addition
to
the
pitcher
repertoire
at
my
trivia
pub
o
as
far
as
brown
ales
go
surly
seems
to
have
got
it
right
i
could
do
with
a
little
heavier
body
but
after
a
long
day
of
med
school
this
hits
the
mark
now
to
find
some
hearty
cheddar
to
go
with
this
o
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
by
far
enough
said
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
of
this
style
that
i
have
tasted
i
really
enjoy
this
brown
ale
and
the
fact
that
its
not
another
over
hopped

overall
a
nice
beer
id
return
to
if

is
a
fine
offering
from
surly
in
the
brown
ale
catagory
easy
drinking
tasty
its
got
a
nice
hint
of
hoppiness
to
it
which
i
find
unusual
for
the
style
but
quite
complimentary
id
have
this
one
again
without
hesitation
o
a
nice
brown
ale
very
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
and
i
am
glad
i
have
a
few
more
cans
for
later
o
i
tend
to
be
a
fan
of
brown
ales
and
therefore
pretty
critical
of
them
but
this
is
impressive
the
aroma
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
but
overall
its
got
just
a
touch
of
everything
maltiness
hoppiness
spices
dryness
sweetness
and
carbonation
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
when
are
you
coming
to
jersey
thanks
brian
overall
just
a
sillysmooth
beer
it
is
certainly
a
little
more
radical
than
your
average
brown
with
the
hop
character
and
roasted
quality
but
it
works
incredibly
well
and
im
sure
i
will
finish
this
four
pack
entirely
too
quickly
o
there
are
a
lot
of
brown
ales
out
there
that
have
slowly
turned
me
away
from
the
style
but
i
would
definitely
want
to
have
this
again
nice
flavors
and
very
good
mouthfeel
make
this
very
enjoyable
overall
nothing
that
stands
out
but
what
its
got
is
good
solid
brew
but
it
didnt
stand
out
in
the
evenings
pretty
stellar
tasting
lineup
o
truly
an
awesome
beer
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
had
will
definitely
keep
buying
this
tasty
elixir
this
stuff
is
da
bomb
seek
it
out
if
youre
not
from
mn
d
very
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
gladly
have
another
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
which
surprised
me
because
i
love
the
coffee
bender
not
sure
how
old
this
can
was
ill
have
to
revisit
this
one
in
the
future

very

overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
ive
even
attempted
a
couple
batches
of
a
clone
homebrew
of
this
which
actually
came
pretty
close
btw
perhaps
a
defining
american
brown
ale
highly
recommended
o
i
typically
like
my
browns
more
on
the
nuttier
side
but
this
was
a
pretty
good
can
of
beer
a
decent
brown
ale
however
the
hops
are
not
really
doing
a
lot
for
me
in
their
creeping
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
has
a
nice
creaminess
and
leaves
smooth
coating
on
the
inside
of
your
mouth
not
a
high
level
of
drinkability
but
not
something
that
is
one
and
done
overall
a
great
brown
ale
that
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
cant
wait
to
try
to
coffee
bender
o
well
made
brown
ale
has
a
lot
of
great
flavors
and
is
an
easy
drinker
one
of
surlys
best
o
better
than
coffee
bender
not
as
stale
and
chalky
refreshing
light
yet
a
flavorful
and
well
done
brown
to
be
honest
im
a
sucker
for
all
of
surly
beers
mostly
but
bender
has
to
be
my
favorite
it
pours
with
a
great
head
and
lace
carbonation
is
minimal
but
well
balanced
nice
deep
garnet
darkish
color
it
smells
of
toast
chocolate
malt
coffee
all
at
the
same
time
man
it
is
complex
tastes
what
it
smells
like
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
head
brewer
todd
haughty
is
genius
for
putting
this
together
my
first
surly
beer
i
had
in
their
first
year
of
business
and
it
remains
my
go
to
the
only
thing
better
is
a
moes
bender
or
coffee
bender
my
review
merely
emphasizes
what
they
say
on
the
can
still
a
very
good
beer
and
one
im
glad
i
got
to
take
another
turn
upon
something
i
would
drink
again
but
it
would
not
be
the
first
beer
i
grab
from
the
fridge
o
a
great
brown
ale
right
up
there
with
the
best
it
may
not
have
the
most
complex
flavors
but
its
delicious
and
smooth
such
a
drinkable
brew
i
dont
normally
buy
browns
but
i
think
bender
just
may
change
that
this
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
it
really
adds
a
dimension
to
a
style
that
has
always
seemed
a
little
bit
1d
to
me

this
is
a
serious
session
brew
perfect
for
the
transitional
seasons
on
a
crisp
cold
fall
day
or
warm
spring
day
quite
the
nice
brown
ale
quite
good
a
very
easy
drinking
brown
ale
a
bit
sweet
but
good
enjoy
light
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
somewhat
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
o
a
very
nice
brown
ale
i
like
some
of
the
additional
flavors
used
to
flavor
the
beer
that
others
dont
coffee
and
cocoa
i
dont
get
that
much
in
taste
but
loved
the
nose
overall
pretty
solid
brown
ale
well
made
and
an
easy
drinker
not
the
best
i
have
had
but
certainly
not
the
worst
love
the
coffee
bender
i
will
add
o
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
that
is
pretty
drinkable
smooth
and
clean
o
a
good
brown
ale
but
the
flavors
of
it
didnt
quite
match
up
to
the
beautiful
pour
and
pleasant
smell
and
smooth
mouthfeel
props
to
surly
for
my
least
favorite
of
their
beers
being
good
in
my
eyes
o
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
that
i
have
tasted
one
that
i
will
repetedly
ask
for
whenever
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
i
am
sad
to
see
my
last
can
go
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
it
again
o
this
is
really
not
a
style
i
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
but
this
beer
gives
me
hope
its
very
well
rounded
and
i
see
it
filling
a
niche
that
i
have
ever
been
able
to
find
in
another
beer
in
this
category
great
job
surly
you
continue
to
truly
amaze
me
i
will
try
hard
to
seek
this
one
out
again
cant
wait
to
try
the
coffee
bender
which
sits
patiently
on
deck
o
best
brown
i
have
had
will
seek
out
and
trade
for
with
my
minnesota
peeps
bender
pours
a
brown
so
dark
that
it
borders
on
black
spotty
cherry
highlights
shine
through
when
the
beers
backlit
the
khaki
colored
head
tops
out
at
about
two
fingers
of
foam
head
retention
is
solid
and
theres
a
thick
ring
of
lacing
marking
the
beers
apex
subsequent
lacing
is
a
bit
spotty
the
nose
is
carried
by
sweet
coffee
and
a
touch
of
milk
chocolate
theres
just
a
little
bit
of
lightly
citric
and
fruity
hop
notes
present
as
well
it
could
stand
to
be
a
little
more
potent
as
well
the
flavor
similarly
bases
itself
around
a
sweet
coffee
maltiness
here
though
the
taste
of
roasted
nuts
steps
in
and
supercedes
milk
chocolate
in
terms
of
secondary
sweet
flavors
that
light
pacific
northwest
hoppiness
is
still
there
but
not
as
noticeable
as
in
the
aroma
oats
were
a
wonderful
addition
to
the
beer
im
surprised
i
dont
see
them
utilized
in
more
brown
ales
though
i
suppose
other
breweries
might
just
not
advertise
their
use
whatever
the
case
the
end
result
is
a
body
thats
a
fair
bit
creamier
than
it
feels
like
it
has
a
right
to
be
given
that
its
not
particularly
full
it
stops
short
of
approaching
watery
though
the
carbonation
is
just
a
touch
higher
than
normal
it
cuts
through
the
malt
and
then
theres
just
a
little
bit
more
so
each
sip
has
a
little
bit
of
excitement
to
it
surly
bender
is
one
of
the
better
american
brown
ales
ive
had
and
one
that
would
be
in
my
fridge
regularly
if
surly
was
distributed
here
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
brown
ale
it
gets
better
as
it
warms
this
is
the
only
brown
ale
i
have
ever
had
from
a
can
i
cant
complain
i
think
it
is
balanced
well
could
be
a
bit
more
complex
not
going
to
go
too
deep
into
this
beer
pretty
much
an
oatmeal
stout
with
a
brown
ale
body
there
are
some
really
nice
vanilla
and
even
a
little
bit
of
coffee
coconut
notes
a
very
good
brown
ale
but
probably
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
get
o
its
ok
nothing
wrong
with
it
per
se
my
wifes
cousin
really
wouldnt
steer
us
in
the
wrong
way
he
likes
surly
so
i
knew
i
would
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
o
love
the
smell
but
just
didnt
live
up
to
its
appearance
and
smell
good
flavor
but
not
great
the
beer
pours
a
sightly
hazy
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
caramel
caramel
and
some
toastedlightly
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
chocolate
as
well
as
some
roasted
malt
and
some
light
grassy
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
american
brown
ale
and
one
i
wish
i
had
regular
access
to
o
one
of
my
staples
when
there
is
nothing
exciting
to
try
i
reviewed
from
a
can
but
prefer
from
draught
my
favorite
beer
from
surlys
regular
line
up
pours
a
deep
chestnut
hue
with
a
frothy
beige
head
nice
sweet
and
roasty
nose
with
oak
dried
cherries
and
vanilla
notes
the
flavor
is
robust
with
sweet
malts
and
fruit
followed
by
enough
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
finish
quaffable
with
good
carbonation
a
very
solid
beer
o
a
delicious
brown
ale
i
would
definitely
have
another
one
o
a
great
brown
one
of
my
favorites
o
i
see
why
this
is
considered
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
on
the
market
i
enjoyed
every
stitch
of
my
sesssion
o
good
brown
ale
im
not
an
avid
brown
ale
guy
but
this
one
is
good
and
i
would
like
to
try
the
coffee
bender
overallanother
solid
brown
ale
that
ive
had
in
the
past
few
months
wonderful
beer
thanks
to
sweetwillyrolbar
for
the
kick
ass
trade
the
only
thing
bad
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
they
dont
distribute
to
texas
i
would
without
a
doubt
buy
this
beer
all
the
time
cheers
o
great
beer
easy
to
drink
very
pleasant
taste
and
local
from
mn
excellent
on
tap
close
to
home
it
is
not
overpowering
in
any
way
which
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
it
is
subtly
very
good
pours
a
dark
brown
with
good
clarity
and
thinlight
tan
head
that
is
partially
wellretained
fills
the
nose
with
powdered
cocoa
caramel
and
brewed
coffee
darker
roasted
malts
more
cocoa
coming
through
in
the
flavor
backed
up
by
some
sweeter
caramellike
notes
moderately
bittered
bit
an
herbal
hop
presence
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
poured
this
american
brown
ale
from
a
tall
boy
can
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
clear
brown
color
and
it
produced
a
small
amount
of
head
however
it
did
have
very
good
retention
the
aroma
of
the
beer
consisted
of
roasted
malt
and
floral
hops
the
taste
of
the
ale
was
interesting
there
was
a
base
of
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
the
beer
seemed
to
have
oily
hop
start
which
gave
way
to
a
chocolate
and
then
coffee
finish
the
finish
was
dry
medium
bodied
beer
overall
it
is
an
interesting
spin
on
an
english
brown
ale
which
is
why
it
is
classified
as
an
american
brown
ale
i
would
drink
this
again
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
2
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
nice
rings
and
patches
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
oats
brown
bread
and
citrus
zest
notes
taste
is
of
oats
bread
nuts
and
a
citrus
zest
taste
on
the
finish
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
fades
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
that
makes
for
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
and
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
o
a
nice
beer
but
not
really
anything
over
the
top
awesome
would
make
for
a
really
nice
session
beer
o
very
nice
brown
o
delicious
brew
with
some
great
crafted
individual
flavors
that
work
very
well
together
i
pray
for
the
day
surly
comes
down
to
mo
i
love
all
their
offerings
so
far
pours
an
impenetrable
brown
two
fingers
of
off
white
fluffy
foam
which
mostly
dissipates
within
a
few
minutes
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
smell
is
subdued
at
times
primarily
honey
at
times
vanilla
sweetness
with
a
solid
backbone
of
roasted
and
caramel
malt
and
touch
of
oatmeal
wow
really
nice
complexity
a
lot
going
on
here
taste
is
roasted
malt
a
little
honey
and
smoke
doesnt
quite
have
the
same
complexity
as
the
aroma
but
on
par
with
the
style
no
hops
in
either
the
smell
or
taste
but
there
is
an
ever
so
slight
tinge
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
carbonation
is
good
mediumlight
body
overall
this
is
very
sessionable
with
an
incredible
aroma
and
which
pairs
well
with
food
i
am
happy
to
try
yet
another
surly
brew
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
ale
and
im
hoping
to
try
the
coffee
version
soon
ogood
brown
ale
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
at
once
but
have
had
better
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
another
o
great
brown
ale
smooth
all
the
right
flavors
dare
i
say
better
than
my
local
favorite
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
from
surly
ive
got
a
can
of
coffee
bender
to
drink
at
some
point
and
can
only
imagine
it
is
as
good
if
not
better
looking
forward
to
it
od
i
always
used
to
dismiss
bender
and
go
with
a
coffee
bender
or
furious
but
after
having
several
cans
recently
i
have
really
begun
to
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
an
excellent
showcase
of
roasted
malt
flavor
without
being
very
heavy
the
subtle
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
complement
the
roasted
character
very
well
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
one
really
love
the
concept
and
execution
here
for
an
oatmeal
brown
ale
bender
because
it
bends
the
style
guidelines
for
sure
quite
tasty
and
i
would
definitely
try
again

to
all
day
drinking
nice
dark
brown
color
creamy
brown
head
doesnt

long

of
faint
burnt

is
delightfully
roasty
with
a
nice
bitter
balance
caramel
brown
sugar
graham
cracker
and
a

very
tasty
wish
i
could
drink
these
daily
overall
though
this
is
avery
solid
standard
nut
like
brown
ale
and
would
have
no
problem
grabbing
again
overall
very
nice
beer
its
rich
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
just
a
winner
i
can
people
falling
in
love
with
this
one
recieved
in
a
trade
of
a
broad
assortment
of
surly
brews
i
have
liked
to
loved
all
of
them
up
to
this
one
which
is
difficult
to
finish
maybe
the
brown
ale
doesnt
travel
well
d
very
drinkable
the
sweet
malt
and
nuttiness
are
really
nice
the
flavors
and
balance
are
really
nice
throughout
the
beer
and
the
finish
is
just
spot
on
with
the
amount
of
sweetness
o
i
really
like
the
color
and
the
mouthfeel
a
lot
and
only
could
wish
for
a
tad
bit
stronger
flavor
but
everything
about
it
makes
it
a
great
session
beer
props
to
surly

surly

is
great
to
have
a
few
of
something
when
not
in
the
mood
for
a
pale
ale
hats
of
to
surly
for
this
and
its
brother
coffee
bender
for
what
would
be
the
flagship
for
the
style
if
it
would
get
distributed
elsewhere
besides
minnesota
overall
solid
for
the
style
but
it
is
missing
something
there
is
nothing
bad
or
offensive
about
the
beer
by
any
means
i
am
hoping
the
coffee
will
tie
it
together
o
overall
a
really
tasty
beer
can
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
its
good

is
about
what
it
deserves
poured

sweet
coffee
in

taste
follows
the
nose

with
notes
of
vanilla

hops
pretty
complex
light
carbonation
and
fairly
thick
not
a
bad
brown
at
all
up
there
with
my
favorites
of
this
style
the
taste
is
black
and
bitter
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
raspberry
this
is
a
like
a
liquid
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
mocha
raspberry
flourless
torte
that
leaves
a
lingering
but
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
one
of
the
best
drinking
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
d
a
very
tasty
sessionable

great
flavor
and
extremely
easy
drinking
o
very
easy
drinkability
nice
sessional
bear
that
is
quit
refreshing
smooth
and
well
balanced
o
a
pretty
decent
beer
nothing
spectacular
and
very
porterlike
for
a
brown
ale
but
decent
nonetheless
i
wish
the
nutty
flavors
had
come
through
a
bit
more
instead
of
hiding
behind
the
hops
and
roasted
malts
taste
pretty
lively
for
a
brown
ale
slight
coffee
nowhere
near
the
amount
of
coffee
bender
vanilla
even
a
tingly
amount
of
hops
present
medium

easy
drinking
enough
hides
alcohol
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
renditions
of
a
brown
ale
o
killer
brew
so
much
going
on
in
what
is
commonly
a
simple
style
but
doesnt
ever
go
overboard

is

up

brown
ale
ive
had
much
better
and
ive
had
much
worse
too
hoppy
and
overhyped
in
my
opinion
cigar
city
maduro
brown
is
heads
and
tails
better
in
every
aspect
and
considering
i
can
get
that
locally
i
will
not
be
revisiting
this
beer
overall
a
tasty
brown
ale
that
is
very
smooth
with
a
nice
kick
of
bitterness
in
the
end
o
i
like
the
coffee
bender
better
still
another
good
beer
from
surly
d
ok
not
only
is
this
the
best
american
brown
ale
i
have
ever
had
its
also
absolutely
delicious
on
the
drinkability
level
for
a
craft
beer
the
makeup
is
absolutely
perfect
in
the
drinkability
department
this
will
be
a
beer
i
continually
highlight
when
the
conversation
comes
up
best
beers
ever
no
exageration
i
like
bender
this
much
i
need
more
d
a
good
brown
out
of
a
can
id
take
another
o
very
solid
brew
that
i
could
drink
again
and
again
if
i
were
in
a
malty
mood
thanks
again
for
this
one
chris
o
great
drinkability
great
taste
average
abv
and
it
comes
in
a
can
dope
d
drinkability
is
high
smooth
taste
good
flavor
and
low
alcohol
make
this
quaffable
i
enjoyed
mine
with
lunch
and
a
hockey
game
and
it
went
by
surprisingly
quick
o
top
quality
brown
ale
really
enjoy
the
maltiness
and
the
chocolate
and
coffee
come
through
nicely
wish
i
could
get
this
more
often
overall
a
solid
4
out
of
5
glad
i
have
some
more
of
these
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
smooth
and
creamy
at
times
which
saves
the
beer
from
becoming
a
mess
drinkability
is
where
the
beer
shines
as
for
all
its
shortcomings
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
throw
down
good
beer
even
if
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
definitely
looking
forward
to
coffee
bender
though
very
high
this
is
my
goto
surly
beverage
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
and
you
dont
feel
like
you
need
a
change
of
pace
simply
put
this
one
is
fantastic
the
cpj
d
a
nice
beer
i
will
gladly
drink
again
but
it
wasnt
all
that
overwhelming
i
enjoyed
it
even
with
the
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
that
i
wasnt
expecting
thanks
to
shir0045
nice
aroma
nice
flavor
nice
feel

is
a
brown

could
see
myself
drinking
all
the
livelong
day

very
sessionable
i
could
drink
this
all

also
with
hearty
or
game
influenced

really
great
brown
only
a
few
i
enjoy
more

to
the
twins
d
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
want
to
see
more
of
like
its
brother
coffee
bender
regular
bender
packs
a
punch
of
complex
aromas
flavors
and
really
has
few
flaws
in
the
world
of
brown
ales
bender
and
its
iterations
is
king
in
my
book
show
me
a
better
brown
i
bet
you
cant
55
this
beer
is
exceptionally
drinkable
overall
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
of
one
of
the
most
drinkable
styles
out
there
very
good
brew
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anybody
just
getting
into
craft
beer
as
a
true
beer
geek
i
can
still
appreciate
a
great
brown
ale
d
a
highly
drinkable
brew
from
surly
not
to
mention
the
first
one
ive
gotten
to
try
from
them
wish
we
got
this
stuff
here
in
ohio
thanks
again
josh
edit
i
just
had
a
can
that
was
dated
two
months
older
than
the
first
one
i
had
its
from
october
and
it
is
now
march
and
i
think
i
like
this
even
more
hop
presence
is
definitely
faded
but
it
has
become
a
lot
sweeter
and
malty
at
the
same
time
im
getting
a
somewhat
crisp
baconburnt
toast
bitterness
that
i
really
enjoy
im
not
going
to
edit
my
score
just
thought
it
might
be
something
of
note
to
others
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
into
a
mini
shifter
modest
beige
head
slides
into
a
todor
brown
hazy
body
clear
oily
lacing
lines
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
dominated
by
malty
sweetness
with
brown
sugar
standing
out
some
coffee
notes
and
raisin
taste
follows
suit
with
the
malt
sweetnesscaramel
dominating
followed
by
mild
coffee
overall
quite
tasty
with
great
drinkability
drinkability
there
is
a
good
level
of
complexity
here
that
makes
this
an
exceptionally
drinkable
brown
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
thin
but
about
what
youd
expect
from
a
5
brown
ale
carbonation
is
well
controlled
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
out
there
looks
like
its
time
to
track
down
some
more
d
great
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
and
still
be
happy
edit
interestingly
enough
a
couple
days
after
posting
my
original
review
i
decided
to
drink
another
one
just
from
the
can
it
really
really
opened
up
the
flavors
in
a
very
surprising
manner
this
time
it
featured
a
nice
chocolate
malt
flavor
throughout
now
im
perplexed
d
at
5
1
it
would
be
easy
to
throw
down
a
four
pack
in
an
evening
but
alas
this
is
a
beer
that
has
to
be
savored
maybe
its
just
nostalgia
but
for
me
bender
is
a
treat
enjoyed
sparingly
d
drinkability
is
pretty
good
decent
balance
nice
feel
and
only
just
a
hint
of
booze
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
something
that
id
go
back
to
again
if
it
was
available
in
the
south
a
well
constructed
beer
easy
to
drink
and
very
flavorful
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
really
smooth
brown
ale
that
has
exceptional
characteristics
for
a
brown
ale
this
is
going
to
end
up
ranking
higher
on
my
list
than
a
lot
of
beers
that
i
like
more
but
this
is
the
best
brown
ale
that
ive
ever
had
so
it
deserves
the
high
marks
an
excellent
drinking
beer
that
is
not
palate
tiring
by
any
means
but
is
very
satisfying
verdict
bender
is
a
great
brown
ale
and
easily
rates
as
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
tried
yet
its
bold
complex
and
easily
drinkable
i
just
wish
it
was
available
here
in
texas
as
far
as
drinkablility
is
concerned
if
i
had
a
kegerator
this
is
what
i
would
fill
it
with
drink
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
had
this
is
my
first
surly
bender
and
first
impressions
tell
me
that
this
is
the
best
american
brown
ale
that
i
have
tasted
i
wish
i
could
get
this
regularly
because
it
would
be
a
very
solid
goto
in
almost
all
circumstances
d
decent
drinkability
i
dont
have
any
desire
to
have
another
one
even
if
that
was
an
option
though
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
glass
drinkability
very
very
high
d
hell
yea
ill
go
on
a
bender
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
and
pushes
the
boundaries
of
the
style
without
losing
its
soul
im
glad
a
have
another
to
toss
back
sometime
soon
more
drinkable
than
almost
any
other
brown
ale
ive
had
bender
from
surly
is
up
there
way
way
up
there
i
need
more
d
this
isnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
the
hops
hit
me
huge
here
it
was
very
good
and
went
down
easily
i
could
have
more
than
one
gotta
say
that
i
enjoyed
the
furious
much
better
but
this
was
tasty
too
another
great
beer
from
surly
id
give
anything
for
them
to
distribute
to
georgia
sigh
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
brown
ale
and
probably
one
of
my
favorites
to
date
i
wish
this
was
distributed
to
the
east
coast
very
sessionable
and
another
great
beer
in
the
surly
lineup
d
another
solid
beer
from
surly
i
really
enjoyed
this
take
on
the
brown
ale
more
flavorful
and
balanced
than
most
i
can
see
why
this
has
such
high
reviews
as
it
was
a
treat
to
try
overall
the
most
exciting
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
drinking
the
snappy
hops
really
position
this
malty
rich
and
flavorful
ale
into
the
spotlight
this
ales
got
more
roasted
and
chocolaty
elements
than
a
lot
of
porters
ive
tried
without
being
pushy
or
out
of
character
a
very
creative
rendition
of
a
brown
ale
thats
stays
true
and
respectful
to
the
style
but
snazzes
it
up
with
a
flair
and
attitude
that
only
surly
can
accomplish
great
ale
for
sure
thanks
surly
overall
surly
makes
another
great
beer
very
sessionable
it
dries
out
nicely
and
nutty
recieved
this
as
a
generous
extra
in
a
trade
recently
pours
with
a
cream
colored
foamy
head
black
pour
that
is
somewhat
transparent
aroma
is
hard
to
pick
up
on
but
there
are
hints
of
nutmeg
and
coffee
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
taste
also
hints
to
a
coffee
vanilla
flavor
but
its
not
robust
or
very
forward
its
somewhat
creamy
but
the
mouthfeel
could
actually
be
a
bit
thicker
in
my
opinion
drinkability
is
good
for
this
one
but
its
nothing
i
would
put
on
the
special
shelf
surprisingly
hop
forward
that
adds
some
crisp
bitterness
up
feot
balancing
out
by
the
mellow
chocolate
malt
center
slightly
roasty
with
hints
of
bread
toffee
and
nut
as
well
as
a
slight
lactic
creaminess
the
bitterness
lingers
throughout
into
a
roasty
dry
finish
but
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
d
really
easy
and
enjoyable
i
dont
mind
brown
ales
and
usually
dont
drink
them
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
the
look
and
feel
are
the
best
parts
for
me
but
i
do
enjoy
the
taste
i
really
enjoyed
this
overall
but
while
it
was
a
great
brown
i
dont
think
it
was
my
favorite
brown
i
totally
see
why
its
a
staple
up
north
really
great
local
ive
got
a
coffee
bender
in
the
fridge
that
i
cant
wait
to
try
compare
to
this
one
m
dry
smooth
and
easy
going
i
just
wish
the
end
wasnt
so
bitter
sk√•l
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
this
would
be
a
beer
fridge
staple
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
d
these
are
so
darn
drinkable
i
could
knock
back
a
few
during
a
game
perfect
balance
of
flavor
and
body
poured
from
can
into
a
typical
shaker
glass
poured
a
deep
mahagony
brown
with
creamy
head
that
lingered
for
a
few
sips
aromas
of
brown
sugar
chocolate
and
nuts
full
bodied
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
nicely
carbonated
taste
was
very
nice
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
no
hop
bitterness
only
thing
missing
is
the
coffee
from
their
coffee
bender
well
done
again
surly
thanks
for
dropping
this
one
off
dan
pours
a
deep
rich
mahogany
color
with
a
creamy
beige
head
aromas
of
wood
dark
brown
sugar
nuts
and
molasses
on
the
palate
full
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
with
flavors
of
chocolate
nuts
and
roasted
malt
drinkable
yeah
pretty
dinnkable
o
average
selection
from
surly
obviously
that
is
better
than
most
thanks
a
ton
for
this
one
lazerlobe
poured
into
a
pint
glass
massive
creamy
head
on
this
one
that
sits
on
top
of
a
transparent
cola
colored
body
the
head
shrinks
down
eventually
and
leaves
soapy
lacing
around
the
rim
the
aroma
is
relatively
faint
but
after
sticking
my
nose
in
this
a
couple
times
i
can
smell
nuts
toasty
malts
and
a
bit
of
citrus
orange
zest
mostly
overall
what
i
would
expect
out
of
a
brown
ale
the
taste
is
toasty
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
just
a
bit
of
orange
zest
from
the
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
suffinciantly
light
with
good
carbonation
and
this
one
is
as
drinkable
as
they
get
great
flavors
and
low
abv
make
this
easy
to
enjoy
serving
type
can
the
color
of
this
beer
is
brown
with
an
amber
hue
with
a
slightly
tan
head
the
smell
reminds
me
of
chocolate
the
taste
has
a
rich
malty
chocolate
taste
to
it
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
like
what
you
would
expect
from
a
brown
ale
finishes
with
a
slight
nutty
taste
to
it
overall
now
i
know
why
coffee
bender
is
so
good
d
pretty
drinkable
lighter
than
a
porter
but
has
a
lot
of
similar
flavors
this
is
a
style
that
i
usually
avoid
but
this
beer
is
really
top
notch
i
wish
i
could
get
it
around
here
id
pick
up
quite
a
bit
of
it
i
will
get
more
of
this
any
chance
i
get
big
thanks
to
pullen
for
this
as
an
extra
in
an
inperson
trade
awhile
back
served
from
can
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
redbrown
with
a
one
finger
slight
tan
head
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
a
nutty
note
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
roasted
malt
chocolate
cream
and
a
nutty
note
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brown
ale
had
an
excellent
flavor
with
a
very
nice
aroma
to
go
along
with
it
all
aspects
were
very
well
balanced
and
left
me
begging
for
more
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
this
style
as
i
usually
avoid
them
at
all
costs
very
nice
job
surly
quite
drinkable
this
just
disappeared
a
great
brown
ale
but
i
liked
the
coffee
version
even
better
i
think
cheers
heck
of
a
beer
for
the
style
its
great
and
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
none
of
the
flavors
or
anything
else
hinder
drinkability
there
is
plenty
going
on
in
this
beer
to
hold
your
interest
for
quite
awhile
bender
is
certainly
a
top
tier
brown
ale
everything
about
these
beer
is
on
point
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
bold
yet
smooth
easy
to
drink
but
with
enough
flavor
that
will
allow
you
to
savor
excellent
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
drinking
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
the
nose
felt
somewhat
subdued
but
other
than
that
this
is
aces
d
well
that
beer
went
quick
insanely
easy
to
drink
i
prefer
this
over
the
coffee
version
drinkability
for
me
is
just
ok
i
like
this
beer
but
only
on
an
occasional
basis
mouthfeel
was
slick
due
to
the
oats
i
expect
but
not
a
really
full
mouthfeel
beer
nicely
drinkable
in
that
way
good
solid
beer
this
one
is
very
very
drinkable
so
long
as
you
like
this
flavor
i
dont
think
the
night
would
ever
stop
with
this
smooth
enjoyable
ale
mfd
drinks
like
a
silky
stout
very
smooth
and
sessionable
imho
very
little
evident
carbonation
with
building
heat
the
taste
was
a
little
thinner
than
i
had
expected
already
a
coffee
taste
up
front
and
not
a
good
lingering
mouthfeel
dissapated
pretty
quickly
drinks
nicely
probably
not
as
well
as
the
typical
brown
ale
due
to
the
roast
and
the
hops
but
like
surly
does
they
do
it
big
and
this
one
is
no
exception
its
unique
and
tasty
definitely
worth
having
around
wow
unbelievable
it
is
like
a
coconutalmond
chocolate
bar
sprinkled
with
fresh
ground
coffee
and
shredded
hop
cones
hands
down
the
best
brown
ale
i
have
ever
had
and
might
be
my
favorite
sub6
brew
ever
hops
are
just
perfectly
integrated
and
the
mouthfeel
so
creamy
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
ever
get
sick
of
this
extraordinary
beer
were
i
to
have
unlimited
access
to
it
wonderful
pours
a
hazed
brown
with
nice
cap
of
off
white
head
good
retention
and
some
sticky
lacing
scent
is
light
but
contains
nice
whiffs
of
roasted
nuts
light
carmel
milk
chocolate
and
the
briefest
hint
of
roasted
espresso
taste
is
a
little
more
aggressive
than
scent
dictates
but
still
under
control
a
nice
blend
of
the
above
mentioned
flavors
where
neither
over
powers
the
other
a
nice
floraly
and
bitter
hoppy
finnish
on
this
as
well
what
makes
it
is
the
rediculously
creamy
body
makes
this
unique
and
such
a
great
beer
to
drink
my
only
gripe
here
is
that
its
a
touch
undercarbonated
a
very
unique
brew
from
its
flavor
profile
down
to
its
smoothy
creamy
body
would
love
to
see
what
they
were
capable
if
they
went
all
out
with
this
one
d
balanced
and
simple
sweet
up
front
with
a
dry
hoppy
clean
finish
help
this
beer
finish
smooth
and
go
down
pretty
easy
entered
from
some
notepad
notes
consumed
on
a
bench
in
a
state
park
near
grand
marais
mn
the
feel
of
this
brew
is
quite
smooth
and
excessively
drinkable
medium
in
the
feel
with
an
acceptable
amount
of
carbonation
lots
of
flavors
going
on
in
this
that
reach
outside
the
spectrum
of
the
typical
brown
style
very
well
done
this
is
definitely
a
solid
brew
this
one
was
very
unique
for
the
style
it
seems
like
a
brown
ale
fused
with
an
ipa
its
hoppy
and
roasty
and
robust
good
to
try
at
least
once
hunt
down
one
bottle
to
try
overall
drinkable
flavorful
and
light
must
say
the
coffee
version
is
a
bit
better
notes
very
good
beer
for
the
style
it
fits
right
in
the
paradigm
i
wish
every
night
before
i
go
to
sleep
that
surly
will
expand
in
my
area
thanks
again
kyle
flavor
and
mouthfeel
crisp
clean
roasted
high
carbonation
its
tough
to
really
pick
anything
else
out
of
this
that
really
stands
out
just
your
average
brown
ale
just
quality
small
amount
of
hops
lingers
in
the
back
and
a
decent
drinker
md
this
beer
is
smooth
as
smooth
can
be
silky
medium
body
the
hops
help
this
beer
a
lot
but
in
my
opinion
the
feel
of
the
beer
is
what
makes
it
so
drinkable
its
like
you
are
drinking
velvet
every
sip
is
a
good
as
the
last
wonderful
job
surly
d
d
a
superb
brown
ale
with
everything
in
the
right
place
a
smooth
and
easy
drinker
a
great
beer
for
the
fall
time
drinkability
a
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
not
over
powering
at
5
1
so
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
these
whether
in
a
session
or
not
bender
is
outrageously
drinkable
no
its
not
a
dipa
or
a
ris
or
any
of
the
big
beers
but
it
is
equally
full
of
flavor
and
arguably
just
as
if
not
more
complex
with
beers
like
this
its
not
difficult
to
see
why
surly
dominates
the
twin
cities
nice
smooth
carb
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
clean
finish
this
is
really
nice
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorite
brown
ales
surly
continues
to
impress
with
a
great
lower
abv
beer
wow
would
i
drink
a
ton
of
this
if
it
was
available
d
this
beer
is
delicious
not
as
good
as
coffee
bender
imo
but
pretty
close
d
very
drinkablethough
the
roasted
malts
and
oat
flavors
are
just
a
touch
much
at
the
end
of
the
pint
d
very
easy
to
drink
surly
beers
they
seem
to
make
me
happy
with
their
drinkability
and
low
abv
while
still
making
some
tasty
beers
drinkability
surly
knows
how
to
make
a
crisp
refreshing
brew
no
doubts
about
that
while
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
it
seems
to
want
for
a
little
more
roast
malt
sweetness
that
typifies
the
style
otherwise
quite
drinkable
i
approve
very
dark
deep
brown
color
some
nice
lacing
remains
as
it
goes
down
the
glass
ok
aromasomewhat
nutty
and
malty
some
bitterness
upfront
flavor
wise
somewhat
of
a
grainychocolate
like
flavor
nuttyagain
the
bitterness
dominates
ok
mouthfeel
decent
us
brown
nice
caramelnuttiness
i
was
not
impressed
the
first
go
round
with
this
beermuch
better
this
time
overall
a
nice
example
of
a
brown
ale
medium
bodied
appropriately
carbonated
smooth
plush
texture
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
not
as
good
as
coffee
bender
but
still
tasty
the
body
was
good
for
the
style
full
without
being
heavy
drinkability
was
good
but
the
coffee
is
not
a
pleasant
taste
for
me
overall
a
decent
beer
that
im
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
you
know
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
ive
never
heard
anything
but
positive
reviews
for
surly
but
the
bender
i
pulled
at
the
triple
rock
was
only
slightly
above
the
average
line
impressive
dark
color
obscures
an
unfortunately
mellow
taste
which
makes
for
a
drinkable
but
not
particularly
delicious
brew
surly
has
since
redeemed
themselves
with
a
few
other
beers
but
this
one
didnt
leave
much
of
an
impression
md
excellent
a
great
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
fresh
and
smooth
i
brew
that
i
can
for
sure
have
more
than
one
of
a
brew
that
should
be
tried
and
traded
to
those
that
cant
get
it
like
all
surly
products
another
great
example
of
a
brew
well
done
omar
and
todd
d
surly
is
the
king
of
the
can
obviously
d
i
had
this
beer
after
drinking
a
glass
of
the
surly
furious
i
couldnt
really
tell
if
the
hoppiness
i
was
tasting
was
leftover
finish
of
the
furious
or
if
it
was
part
of
this
beer
as
well
but
that
taste
didnt
work
well
with
me
in
this
beer
hopefully
i
can
review
it
again
if
i
come
accross
it
i
got
this
in
a
trade
from
dmangtr
and
couldnt
be
happier
ive
been
trying
to
get
my
hands
on
this
beer
for
a
couple
of
years
and
it
did
not
disappoint
thanks
daren
slainte
recommended
if
you
like
brown
ales
or
malty
beers
d
surly
does
truly
excellent
stuff
im
told
this
is
pretty
affordable
over
in
minnesota
which
makes
me
pretty
darn
jealous
i
wish
i
could
find
a
brown
ale
of
this
caliber
out
here
d
another
exceptional
surly
brew
coffee
bender
is
certainly
a
step
up
but
this
beer
stands
up
well
on
its
own
very
very
drinkable
thanks
omar
drinkability
is
very
good
d
very
flavorfull
despite
the
low
abv
nothing
too
strong
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
d
another
solid
beer
from
surly
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
the
chance
to
try
as
it
balances
the
sweetness
and
nuttiness
quite
well
d
surly
continues
to
impress
me
today
this
is
a
markedly
fullflavoured
beer
for
5
and
if
i
ever
go
to
mn
im
going
to
buy
this
again
wonderful
beer
d
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
brown
great
taste
and
low
abv
make
drinkability
high
surly
continues
to
impress
with
everything
ive
tried
from
them
d
pretty
damn
good
drinkability
i
had
22oz
no
problem
could
of
easily
had
more
overall
its
a
fantastic
beer
and
a
classic
version
of
the
style
im
looking
forward
to
my
next
visit
to
minnesota
overall
a
great
beer
from
surly
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
all
around
very
fine
american
brown
ale
one
of
the
best
ive
had
wish
i
could
get
it
in
philly
drinkability
well
its
a
shame
this
isnt
readily
available
to
me
as
id
keep
this
stocked
as
often
as
possible
d
nice
smooth
brown
ale
a
little
bit
different
than
im
used
to
but
quite
good
alcohol
is
on
the
low
side
at
5
1
making
this
a
very
easy
drinker
i
enjoy
the
coffee
bender
more
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
on
its
own
d
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
brown
ale
pretty
new
to
surlys
products
but
i
would
have
liked
a
little
less
coffee
taste
since
they
already
have
a
brew
in
coffee
bender
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
but
it
was
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
drinkability
is
good
overall
a
good
session
beer
with
an
interesting
porterlike
flavor
the
feel
is
nice
d
i
like
browns
and
this
isnt
your
typical
brown
well
blended
nice
take
on
the
style
goes
down
easily
not
filling
this
is
definitely
a
sessionable
brew
drinkability
the
numbers
dont
really
show
it
but
i
give
it
a
4
overall
as
i
really
enjoy
the
flavors
and
feel
that
i
would
find
this
to
be
a
pretty
refreshing
beverage
on
a
warm
spring
day
but
not
in
the
dog
days
of
summer
as
it
does
start
to
sit
a
little
heavy
on
the
belly
mouthfeel
is
creamy
from
the
oats
and
drinkability
is
good
i
cant
really
compare
this
beer
to
anything
i
have
had
and
i
love
that
about
it
i
love
pretty
much
any
beer
made
with
oats
as
well
the
creaminess
really
does
it
for
me
i
cant
say
it
was
a
best
beer
i
ever
had
but
i
will
say
that
it
was
very
good
and
interesting
the
combination
of
flavors
works
pretty
well
together
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
i
love
trying
new
things
and
this
one
stands
out
as
different
for
sure
d
when
given
the
option
at
any
point
in
the
year
i
almost
always
take
a
furious
but
i
never
complain
when
im
drinking
this
on
tap
surly
nation
whoop
d
potent
taste
but
with
a
lighter
body
34
is
within
my
range
the
beer
style
was
clarified
by
feloniousmonk
a
long
time
ago
this
one
is
an
oatmeal
brown
porter
d
for
a
beer
this
hoppy
superbly
drinkable
brown
with
a
secret
of
maroon
an
upstanding
creamy
head
smells
a
bit
chocolatey
creamy
and
touch
nutty
i
wish
i
could
pluck
just
which
one
mild
flavor
a
nice
taste
nothing
very
punchy
just
a
really
drinkable
beer
with
a
bit
of
a
roasty
creamy
character
and
a
widening
body
a
pleasant
drink
id
like
to
try
the
coffee
bender
i
think
that
intensity
is
what
is
missing
in
this
one
for
me
d
surly
makes
some
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
of
all
time
and
this
is
really
no
exception
the
body
mouth
and
nice
but
simple
enjoyable
character
make
this
the
definition
of
a
sessionable
beer
seek
it
out
drink
it
its
good
yet
another
winner
from
surly
i
have
a
feeling
this
can
of
bender
had
some
age
on
it
but
i
still
found
it
to
be
quite
enjoyable
hopefully
down
the
road
i
can
pickup
a
fresh
one
to
compare
d
the
brown
ale
style
i
feel
is
one
of
the
most
under
appreciated
styles
in
america
today
but
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
biz
and
love
the
art
on
the
cans
kudos
to
surly
overall
it
is
an
average
semi
watery
easy
drinker
overall
for
a
little
bit
i
was
starting
to
get
bored
of
bender
but
the
ontap
totally
revived
it
for
me
drinkability
is
amazing
amazing
on
this
beer
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
4
5
d
damn
tasty
brown
couldnt
ask
for
much
more
thanks
to
dave
for
this
treat
nice
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
solid
tanned
cap
aromas
are
blocked
by
the
fluffy
foam
but
a
solid
sniff
elicits
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
falls
in
between
the
bracing
brightness
of
an
ipa
and
the
robust
char
of
a
porter
either
way
the
bitterness
is
there
and
it
leaves
a
significant
and
longlasting
aftertaste
i
happen
to
love
it
malt
notes
from
caramel
munchentype
sweetness
mix
with
the
coffee
tone
while
the
hops
bring
forth
tobacco
earthiness
and
a
hint
of
menthol
and
pine
pretty
good
stuff
all
around
and
highly
recommended
if
youre
in
the
area
d
a
great
beer
for
cool
weather
i
could
easly
take
care
of
the
four
right
now
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
take
of
the
american
brown
ale
with
rich
flavors
and
great
balance
thanks
again
chuck
for
supplying
me
with
this
recommended
great
take
on
a
brown
ale
d
its
good
overall
but
as
usual
i
cant
get
passed
the
stupid
grass
flavored
hops
not
appealing
to
me
but
the
beer
as
a
whole
is
well
not
one
of
my
better
reviews
if
anyone
would
like
to
trade
me
for
some
more
in
a
can
i
would
happily
rereview
this
beer
overall
a
fantastic
brown
ale
i
will
have
to
pick
up
as
much
as
i
can
next
time
i
go
to
the
twin
cities
d
i
love
this
beer
and
fortunately
it
is
readily
available
here
totally
sessionable
but
also
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
as
a
single
beer
this
may
be
the
best
american
brown
ale
in
the
market
d
once
again
another
retarded
drinkable
beer
from
surly
i
cant
wait
to
try
another
beer
from
them
they
can
do
no
wrong
when
it
comes
to
brewing
it
looks
like
a
nice
brown
ale
with
low
carbonation
the
maltiness
is
evident
and
it
is
crisp
with
an
even
bitterness
i
have
yet
to
try
the
coffee
bender
in
my
fridge
and
i
am
quite
interested
to
try
it
as
this
beer
has
a
definite
undertone
of
coffee
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
i
can
think
of
a
number
of
foods
i
would
pair
this
with
mouth
medium
co2
some
residual
sweetnessstickiness
nice
and
rich
long
lingering
finish
excellent
american
brown
ale
with
a
mess
of
complexity
swimming
around
in
the
pint

drinkability
for
such
a
rich
medium
to
full
bodied
compled
brew
search
out
this
beer

bodied

easy
drinking
great
beer
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
lingering
ring
of
tan
foam
smells
of
cocoa

coffee
light
toffee
and
a
hint
of

i
can
always
have
in
the
fridge
however
i
still
will
take
a
coffee
bender
over
the
regular
bender
drinkability
at
5
1
abv
this
is
the
ideal
year
round
session
beer
in
minnesota
it
is
also
the
best
brown
ale
whether
english
american
india
or
hybrid
that
i
have
had
drinks
alright
but
a
bit
too
much
coffee
to
make
me
happy
stylewise
liked
this
better
on
tap
or
the
in
your
face
coffee
bender
this
one
blurs
some
style
lines
for
me
but
overall
a
great
beer
cant
wait
to
try
the
coffee
bender
d
this
brew
goes
down
very
easily
one
of
the
most
drinkable
browns
ive
experienced
another
great
brew
from
these
guys
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
high
given
the
low
abv
and
the
tastiness
of
the
malts
overall
this
is
one
fine
beer
just
a
great
example
of
how
malts
can
be
used
if
all
other
surly
offerings
are
as
nice
as
this
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
skal
thanks
to
dansting
for
this
one
16oz
can
served
in
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
clear
brown
with
less
than
a
finger
of
tan
head
nose
is
pretty
subdued
a
little
chocolate
malt
and
some
faint
hops
gets
a
little
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
light
to
medium
bodied
chocolate
malt
and
cocoa
are
the
predominate
flavors
hops
show
up
in
the
dry
finish
also
a
nice
lingering
flavor
of
chocolate
solid
brown
ale
very
drinkable
drink
ability
is
good
pretty
session
able
brown
ale
definitely
at
the
top
of
the
list
with
brooklyn
brown
and
dogfish
india
brown
ale
too
bad
its
not
distributed
in
colorado
would
buy
again
if
available
d
drinkability
is
exceptional
could
drink
these
all
night
thanks
again
to
br3wmeister
for
a
chance
to
try
this
not
as
good
as
the
coffee
bender
but
nice
enough
body
is
light
soft
and
built
on
a
good
swell
of
fine
carbonation
making
this
dangerously
drinkable
this
is
pretty
much
its
own
thing
and
this
thing
is
good
d
great
drinkability
this
beer
never
seems
dull
and
never
overtakes
the
palate
one
of
my
favorites
d
very
sessionable
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
is
a
great
change
of
pace
beer
from
the
heavier
impy
stouts
or
ultra
hoppy
dipas
yet
extremely
satisfying
d
i
could
drink
a
whole
case
100
im
having
a
hard
time
stopping
a
blend
of
apa
american
brown
and
american
porter
with
a
well
balanced
and
very
broad
range
as
a
beer
with
such
a
low
abv
there
is
fruit
apple
from
the
brown
mild
bitter
citrus
from
the
apa
and
some
dark
fruit
and
plum
and
english
style
stale
grape
from
the
american
porter
there
is
chocolate
and
smokiness
bitter
like
coffee
as
in
earthy
but
not
coffee
like
like
the
coffee
bender
a
lot
of
malt
and
quite
a
finish
of
bitterness
that
i
dont
really
remember
in
the
can
the
can
also
seemed
a
tad
sweeter
more
chocolaty
great
in
both
venues
different
but
still
such
a
big
beer
that
different
things
appear
in
different
circumstances
and
batches
for
that
matter
d
pretty
solid
brown
ale
all
in
all
my
first
surly
beer
as
of
date
and
eagerly
open
to
trying
more
in
the
future
with
that
being
said
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
was
my
first
and
last
bender
so
to
speak
d
not
too
heavy
that
you
couldnt
have
just
one
in
a
sitting
but
just
perfect
for
a
late
fall
evening
simply
a
sweet
tasting
delicious
beer
to
be
savored
surly
just
keeps
doing
it
again
and
again
another
solid
brew
in
a
can
just
goes
to
show
that
more
breweries
need
to
start
canning
there
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
this
beer
not
too
shab
would
be
really
interested
to
try
it
on
tap
definitely
try
it
but
dont
count
on
it
being
a
go
to
i
feel
like
my
actual
score
for
this
beer
wont
be
entirely
representative
of
that
stance
not
bad
not
my
fave
an
easy
drinker
but
i
dont
know
that
id
jump
at
the
chance
to
have
another
given
other
options
d
a
good
beer
for
a
style
im
not
crazy
about
can
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
some
coffee
grounds
flavor
of
slightly
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
creamy
smoothness
thankfully
this
is
a
brown
ale
thats
not
dominated
by
super
sweet
malt
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
certainly
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
d
a
very
good
dark
ale
im
a
big
fan
of
this
one
brown
ales
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
pretty
tasty
and
impressive
as
for
drinkability
well
its
a
little
dark
and
rich
but
we
had
a
little
over
a
half
gallon
apiece
with
no
problems
i
would
say
that
qualifies
as
a
good
fallwinter
session
beer
d
very
good
beer
and
enjoyable
to
drink
really
wish
i
could
get
ahold
of
this
in
my
area
this
just
might
be
the
best
american
brown
period
holy
crap
mdmedium
bodied
and
washes
down
clean
with
a
grain
aftertaste
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
ale
great
for
session
drinking
but
coming
from
a
style
that
doesnt
stand
out
good
job
again
surly
which
is
were
it
might
work
d
this
is
a
session
beer
for
sure
it
explodes
with
flavor
but
isnt
heavy
at
all
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
pours
very
very
dark
brown
espresso
brown
into
the
pint
glass
cant
see
through
it
at
all
dark
but
not
real
thick
thin
head
but
retains
nicely
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
average
not
much
nose
a
bit
of
dark
malt
is
all
taste
is
a
whole
new
ballgame
up
front
a
balance
of
sweet
malt
with
dark
malt
then
the
oatmeal
smoothness
begins
to
kick
in
along
with
some
coffeechocolatey
stouteyness
it
almost
is
like
a
stout
that
is
flavorful
without
being
harsh
and
burnt
smooths
out
to
vanilla
and
a
healthy
dose
of
hops
on
the
finish
just
enough
hops
to
be
interesting
without
overwhelming
everything
perfectly
carbonated
super
creamy
flavors
blend
and
linger
on
the
palate
perfectly
sessionable
and
very
drinkable
if
this
were
available
in
ma
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
just
awesome
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
an
extremely
dark
amber
color
which
you
can
only
see
by
holding
to
the
light
from
a
distance
it
looks
black
offwhite
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
with
good
lacing
aroma
is
of
roasted
caramel
chocolate
and
vanilla
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
subtle
amount
of
carbonation
flavors
of
sweet
malt
and
burnt
chocolate
with
a
subtle
hop
and
coffee
aftertaste
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
a
good
beer
that
i
would
like
to
have
at
some
point
in
the
future
overall
thanks
go
out
to
ohlrangers
for
generously
hooking
me
up
with
this
beer
it
is
great
i
love
it
overall
this
isnt
a
beer
that
will
be
rated
as
high
as
and
ris
or
dipa
but
theres
really
not
reason
it
shouldnt
be
d
wonderful
all
the
way
around
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
exceptional
a
wonderful
introduction
to
surly
the
only
problem
with
the
beer
is
that
it
isnt
regularly
available
in
pa
world
class
its
a
sweet
brown
beer
coming
out
of
a
can
its
weird
for
sure
its
good
and
id
have
another
stillwhy
doesnt
it
come
from
a
bottle
in
12oz
servings
anyway
yes
surly
does
it
again
a
supremely
drinkable
beer
and
a
tasty
example
of
a
style
im
normally
not
that
into
serving
suggestion
standard
pint
glass
very
full
bodied
brown
ale
lots
going
on
almost
not
sessionable
though
still
is
id
love
to
have
some
more
worth
noting
that
i
much
preferred
this
to
the
coffee
bender
i
thought
it
had
a
much
better
body
and
overall
complexity
despite
one
less
ingredient
note
to
self
ranked
2
american
brown
ale
behind
only
coffee
bender
when
i
tried
it
pours
nice
dark
crimson
brown
with
good
amount
of
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
smells
sweet
and
malty
with
a
slight
hint
of
honey
taste
is
nice
and
toasty
with
the
malt
and
honey
coming
through
and
a
nice
subtle
toffee
flavor
wonderful
carbonation
and
thickness
all
of
this
and
a
low
abv
make
this
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
long
while
theres
a
reason
this
beer
is
seen
as
one
of
the
best
examples
of
its
style
in
the
world
theres
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
depth
and
complexity
to
its
flavour
profile
and
this
puts
it
head
and
shoulders
above
most
of
its
contemporaries
the
appearance
and
aroma
are
stunning
but
i
do
feel
slightly
let
down
by
the
mouthfeel
which
is
adequate
but
doesnt
match
the
high
standards
of
the
beers
other
components
huge
thanks
to
bryan
bigbry
for
this
can
and
an
assortment
of
other
great
beers
very
quaffable
manages
to
be
thristquenching
and
sating
at
the
same
time
ideal
setting
for
this
beer
hmm
im
thinking
outdoors
a
temperate
fall
afternoon
reuben
sandwich
i
would
summarize
this
as
a
better
fat
tire
d
kind
of
threw
me
off
because
i
thought
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
porter
but
i
kind
of
figured
it
was
a
brown
ale
on
tasting
pretty
good
flavors
the
strong
alcohol
flavor
doesnt
make
this
that
drinkable
though
pours
a
bit
like
a
coke
quite
dark
and
opaque
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
looong
time
great
lacing
smells
pretty
hoppy
for
a
brown
has
that
distinct
brown
ale
bite
very
flavorful
and
complex
on
the
downside
mouthfeel
might
be
a
bit
thin
pouring
a
beer
like
this
out
of
a
can
was
definitely
unexpected
very
drinkable
brown
ale
the
best
ive
had
to
date
d
easy
to
drink
brown
ale
darker
ales
have
somewhat
heartier
flavors
often
and
lighter
dark
ales
sometimes
fall
into
the
trap
of
using
too
much
specialty
grain
for
their
size
bender
does
a
very
good
job
of
providing
a
balanced
brown
ale
this
seems
to
be
a
moderate
brew
for
all
the
hype
of
it
id
like
a
bit
more
roasted
bitterness
to
balance
with
the
hops
but
other
than
that
it
was
decent
drinkability
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
so
my
opinion
might
be
somewhat
biased
despite
being
relatively
low
in
alcohol
something
about
this
beer
made
it
more
of
a
sipper
i
cant
say
id
want
to
have
more
than
one
nor
can
i
say
id
seek
it
out
again
still
glad
i
tried
it
good
job
dudes
at
surly
good
job
i
got
this
in
a
trade
from
wery0001
i
poured
from
a
16
ounce
can
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
white
head
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
has
chocalate
coffee
the
flavor
follows
not
overly
bitter
bender
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
nice
creamy
mouth
feel
bender
is
a
nice
drinking
brown
ale
pours
dark
amber
brown
with
little
head
into
a
tulip
smell
is
very
sweet
nice
medium
malt
base
with
maybe
too
lively
carbonation
little
to
no
hops
but
this
can
is
at
least
a
year
old
overall
a
great
brown
drinkability
quite
drinkable
smooth
and
went
well
with
the
old
chicago
seven
calzone
i
had
i
had
the
25
oz
mug
and
it
went
down
easy
no
roasted
flavors
while
tasting
but
all
the
flavors
balance
very
well
together
dont
get
a
whole
lot
of
in
your
face
oats
or
cocoa
but
again
well
balanced
great
beer
overal
initially
a
crisp
mouthfeel
but
became
creamier
as
you
drank
more
of
it
poured
from
a
16
ounce
can
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
appears
a
mildly
hazy
rich
mahogany
color
with
a
solid
two
fingers
of
creamy
tan
head
thin
lacing
sticks
to
the
inside
of
the
glass
smells
and
tastes
of
nutty
roasted
caramel
malts
cocoa
brown
sugar
molasses
and
mild
coffee
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
creamy
satisfying
mouthfeel
this
is
one
great
brown
ale
a
really
tasty
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
all
day
i
would
buy
this
by
the
case
if
i
could
great
great
beer
drinkability
is
good
took
me
a
while
to
finish
it
could
probably
have
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
but
thats
all
d
so
drinkable
absolutely
delicious
could
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
d
enjoyable
a
good
session
beer
that
is
very
hearty
id
order
a
second
but
wont
buy
in
a
4pack
deep
translucent
hazel
brown
color
with
ruby
flares
against

light
tan

frothy
head
with
low

and
streaky
thin
lacing

is
roasted

bready
nutty
slight
coffee
and
sweet
chocolate
flavor
has
amazing
balance
of
both
sweet
and
bitter
alternating
between
roast
malt
and
nuttiness
versus
a
fresh
hoppy
bitterness
creamy
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
but
strong
bite
from
hops
an
excellent
refreshing
hoppy
brown
bender
was
dark
brown
in
color
it
had
a
nice
rocky
beige
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
was
toasty
malt
some
chocolate
and
a
little
coffee
the
taste
was
dark
malt
with
some
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
coffee
with
a
nice
bitterness
towards
the
dry
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
that
i
have
tried
this
is
easily
the
best
version
of
an
american
brown
ale
ive
had
its
very
complex
yet
insanely
drinkable
i
am
going
to
stock
up
when
i
go
to
mn
received
as
a
generous
extra
from
dbhog
served
in
a
nonic
poured
a
translucent
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
when
backlit

inch
dense
khakicolored

left
behind
delicate
bands
of

as
it
receded
nose
suggests
chocolate
malt
taste
reveals
cocoa
coffee
a
slight
roasty
char
and
a
kiss
of
hops
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
between
light
and
mediumbodied
lightly
effervescent
with
a
creamy
smooth
texture
incredibly
drinkable
brown
ale
sessionable
and
tasty
this
is
a
solid
reminder
that
not
all
beers
have
to
be
extreme
to
be
flavorful
and
satisfying
overall
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
surly
has
done
it
again
another
great
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
browns
ive
had
to
date
darn
glad
i
have
a
few
extra
for
camping
season
the
can
of
beer
pours
a
solid
brown
with
garnet
highlights
modest
head
and
lacing
the
smell
develops
as
the
beer
warms
up
and
reveals
earthy
grains
with
nutty
overtones
taste
is
outstanding
for
a
brown
loads
of
oatey
malts
but
a
great
hop
bite
makes
for
an
exceptionally
crisp
beer
im
no
expert
on
brown
ale
but
this
beer
seems
unusually
clean
and
brisk
in
a
category
rich
in
sweet
and
mellow
quaffers
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
pretty
rich
with
the
hops
clearing
things
out
nicely
without
the
sweet
sticky
residue
some
brown
ales
leave
behindagain
im
no
expert
drinkability
is
outstanding
very
sessionable
im
delighted
to
have
this
one
on
draft
within
stumbling
distance
from
my
home
seems
more
like
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
thin
layer
the
smell
is
malty
with
a
slight
milk
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
espresso
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
bitter
chocolate
creamy
milk
chocolate
and
some
coffee
notes
on
the
finish
there
are
some
dark
fruits
mixed
in
the
sweetness
and
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
this
seems
bigger
than
the
5
drinkability
is
great
no
alcohol
burn
yet
still
a
lot
of
body
i
find
it
very
hard
to
get
that
combination
overall
i
am
truly
impressed
with
surly
and
this
beer
drinkability
not
a
fan
of
brown
ales
and
this
is
middle
of
the
road
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
will
have
no
problem
finishing
this
only
wish
i
could
easily
get
more
coffee
bender
is
next
almost
a
reddish
brown
pour
miniscule
off
white
head
smells
surprisingly
floral
some
pine
with
some
malt
and
molasses
lightmedium
body
with
a
healthy
dose
of
carbonation
flavors
of
malt
molasses
and
brown
sugar
a
surprisingly
strong
coffee
note
to
me
would
be
curious
to
see
how
much
more
the
coffee
bender
has
finishes
real
clean
drinkability
is
not
a
problem
for
this
one
somewhere
between
a
brown
and
a
porter
i
guess
my
friend
did
not
like
this
one
i
thought
it
was
excellent
overall
i
love
bender
it
is
the
best
of
its
style
even
though
it
doesnt
fall
into
a
category
i
highly
recommend
getting
your
hands
on
this
if
you
can
im
surprised
by
the
subtleness
of
this
beer
im
never
impressed
by
brown
ales
because
i
find
the
style
to
be
lackluster
but
this
was
very
enjoyable
d
drinks
okay
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
again
j
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
puffy
tan
head
smells
of
coffee
and
malts
and
chocolate
tastes
a
little
bitter
nice
coffee
and
sweet
flavors
blended
together
in
this
less
than
moderate
carbonation
very
thick
this
is
ok
i
think
i
will
try
something
else
next
time
around
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
this
is
where
the
beer
falls
off
for
me
i
would
like
more
depth
for
a
brown
overall
i
think
the
whole
beer
itself
is
good
with
clean
flavors
but
give
this
is
a
skinny
beer
give
me
some
body
drinkability
perhaps
the
best
of
the
surly
brews
ive
tried
thus
far
tonight
havent
had
darkness
yet
and
i
tried
furious
before
this
is
a
flavorful
lowinalcohol
crisp
and
refreshing
brew
striking
the
right
balance
between
complexity
and
simplicity
give
this
one
a
try
if
i
lived
in
minnesota
itd
likely
be
a
goto
this
one
is
a
medium
dark
brown
with
a
lumpy
yellow
head
smells
mildly
of
chocolate
and
coffee
tastes
very
mildly
of
malt
chocolate
maybe
some
fruit
but
its
such
a
mild
flavor
that
nothing
really
makes
itself
known
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bit
too
thin
for
my
taste
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
but
nothing
too
special
d
very
drinkable
beer
this
can
was
gone
and
im
glad
scoobydank
sent
me
3
more
the
flavors
are
all
balanced
and
its
really
a
nice
session
beer
subtle
roasted
malt
aromawith
a
surprisingly
noticeable
hop
presence
at
least
for
the
style
imo
nice
light
chocolate
and
toffee
flavors
with
a
good
nutty
presence
i
wouldve
expected
a
little
more
out
of
this
one
but
it
is
certainly
sessionable
i
am
definitely
be
interested
in
trying
the
coffee
version
though
d
this
is
an
awesome
brown
ale
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
reminds
me
a
lot
of
terrapin
indian
brown
great
hoppy
characteristics
accent
a
nice
complex
brown
ale
with
a
good
mouthfeel
would
trade
for
this
again
though
it
is
similar
to
the
terrapin
which
is
locally
available
drinkability
is
great
and
abv
is
undetectable
m
d
smooth
lighter
carbonation
a
good
body
to
it
feels
good
tastes
quite
nice
and
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
d
3
5
ok
but
way
over
rated
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
some
bland
off
flavors
not
at
all
representative
of
the
style
havent
been
disappointed
with
any
of
the
surly
offerings
just
yet
no
exception
here
plenty
drinkable
not
too
heavy
but
with
plenty
of
flavor
reminds
me
of
dfh
india
brown
ale
d
usually
have
a
couple
of
these
couldnt
have
too
much
though
as
it
gets
somewhat
heavy
serving
type
can
d
ill
seek
this
one
out
again
and
if
it
were
local
id
have
this
on
hand
all
the
time
great
mouthfeel
really
good
everything
else
i
bet
this
one
would
be
great
with
all
kinds
of
food
too
taste
great
feels
great
and
at
5
1abv
its
one
of
the
lower
alcohol
beers
they
offer
i
can
drink
a
4
pack
in
a
sitting
and
on
a
cold
ass
day
like
today
4f
i
just
might
what
a
great
brew
to
date
i
think
its
my
favorite
this
in
combination
with
summit
oatmeal
stout
i
think
will
get
me
to
adventure
more
into
darker
ales
and
other
brews
bravo
the
beer
is
poured
a
browndark
ruby
colour
with
a
nice
off
white
head
with
okay
retention
but
great
retention
the
nose
of
the
beer
is
chocolaty
and
sweet
which
is
a
great
surprise
when
drinking
this
beer
its
apparent
its
not
a
normal
brown
ale
but
that
makes
it
that
much
better
there
is
a
nice
chocolate
flavour
mixed
with
some
great
sweet
malts
there
is
also
a
bit
of
maybe
hazelnut
in
the
back
as
well
the
flavours
are
complex
for
this
relatively
low
alcohol
beer
to
me
this
is
one
of
the
ultimate
session
beers
i
could
and
would
drink
this
all
night
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
as
well
d
very
drinkable
nice
solid
beer
especially
one
that
is
in
a
can
drinkability
very
good
nice
brown
ale
a
good
canned
beer
that
i
would
buy
if
it
were
local
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
creme
head
nose
is
vegetal
minor
coffee
flavor
is
brightly
coffee
like
i
feel
like
its
unroasted
beans
still
gives
a
full
and
fairly
robust
profile
though
i
like
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
middle
of
the
road
i
remember
the
carbonation
being
abrasive
when
i
had
it
ontap
i
like
this
beer
easily
an
all
night
brew
if
it
were
readily
available
that
is
and
there
goes
350
reviews
time
flies
when
youre
drinking
beer
black
body
with
foam
that
is
the
true
definition
of
creamy
it
leaves
rings
of
in
the
glass
that
are
connected
by
sheets
of
lacing
head
retention
is
good
and
stays
for
the
majority
of
the
glass
toasty
malt
nose
this
beer
showcases
the
malt
very
smooth
with
some
mellow
wood
and
tobacco
up
against
brown
sugar
and
dry
malt
with
a
hint
of
apple
from
the
yeast
an
earthy
hop
presence
is
noticeable
in
the
first
few
sips
and
even
more
later
into
the
session
this
seems
to
be
the
point
of
intrigue
for
me
that
lasting
earthy
bitterness
that
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
but
disappears
shortly
thereafter
very
smooth
and
medium
bodied
not
filling
easy
to
session
without
sacrificing
flavor
nice
stuff
surly
bender
pours
black
with
a
large
creamy
tan
head
the
nose
is
roasty
coffee
and
cocoa
with
some
citrus
hops
in
there
too
there
are
some
really
bold
flavors
in
here
there
is
a
chocolate
roasted
coffee
and
vanilla
there
is
also
some
fruitiness
and
some
nice
bitterness
and
citrus
hops
for
a
brown
ale
very
drinkable
awesome
i
found
no
discernible
difference
from
the
can
with
this
beer
d
okay
but
really
im
done
after
one
d
this
flavor
tires
fast
for
me
basically
this
is
just
tons
of
fun
and
thats
even
more
impressive
in
a
style
that
is
usually
staid
drinkability
is
good
bender
is
a
very
solid
brown
i
wish
it
was
a
widely
available
local
value
as
is
ill
just
have
to
savor
my
one
last
can
and
keep
my
eye
out
for
it
in
my
future
travels
d
this
is
a
brown
ale
but
oh
so
flavorful
thick
and
balanced
a
delicious
beer
and
i
am
shocked
this
is
only
5
10
abv
as
it
is
so
satisfying
for
this
beer
geek
the
idea
of
sessioning
this
beer
is
appealing
indeed
whatever
hype
there
is
for
this
beer
is
definitely
lived
up
to
and
now
i
want
to
try
some
coffee
bender
d
high
great
session
beer
with
the
unique
surly
fresh
taste
awesome
beer
from
an
awesome
brewery
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
enjoyable
while
i
prefer
furious
and
darkness
this
beer
is
no
slouch
and
serves
as
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
really
wish
i
had
more
of
these
i
could
see
this
one
becoming
one
of
my
everyday
beers
in
the
fridge
if
only
it
was
available
here
in
nh
thanks
again
corey
very
drinkable
lots
of
different
flavors
going
on
they
all
swirl
together
and
leave
the
mouth
with
an
interesting
aftermath
overall
solid
brew
sweet
caramel
and
pale
chocolate
malts
hit
the
palate
first
quickly
giving
way
to
a
delectably
bitter
coffee
and
hop
finish
for
a
brown
ale
the
flavor
is
complex
and
transitions
nicely
but
as
ive
noticed
of
other
canned
craft
beers
the
middle
notes
fall
a
bit
flat
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
but
still
good
with
a
mediumlight
body
gentle
carbonation
level
and
a
shortlived
lingering
bitterness
on
the
finish
overall
a
highly
drinkable
brew
but
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
hoppy
brown
ale
terrapin
and
dogfish
heads
india
brown
ales
edge
out
bender
albeit
slightly
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
carbonated
it
has
a
very
nice
texture
to
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
think
ill
have
to
make
an
effort
to
find
it
around
here
very
good
full
flavored
beer
has
a
nice
complex
flavor
recomened
drinkability
heck
yes
what
do
you
expect
its
a
surly
thanks
to
tolann
for
this
one
i
cant
wait
for
the
other
can
of
surly
ive
got
i
owe
you
dry
dock
drinakability
is
off
the
charts
i
got
eight
of
these
in
a
trade
with
ohlrangers
and
i
didnt
review
it
till
the
last
one
because
i
was
enjoying
them
too
much
from
a
16oz
can
this
beer
pours
a
dark
chocolate
brown
that
has
ruby
hues
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
poured
an
ample
beige
head
that
melts
into
just
a
thin
layer
around
the
rim
of
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
the
aroma
is
a
good
nuttiness
up
front
with
hints
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
oatmeal
coming
through
the
taste
is
almonds
and
chocolate
that
turns
into
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
toffee
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
little
over
carbonated
this
is
another
very
drinkable
beer
by
surly
d
big
roasty
and
nutty
with
a
good
hop
kick
lots
of
flavors
going
on
here
and
they
really
come
together
in
the
finish
solid
beer
from
surly
d
this
could
be
a
beer
i
go
to
a
lot
if
it
were
local
to
me
d
full
flavored
but
still
fully
quaffable
what
a
brown
ale
should
be
put
this
on
the
short
list
of
excellent
brown
ales
silky
smooth
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
and
a
perfect
level
of
carbonation
probably
the
easiest
drinking
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
one
can
is
not
enough
i
could
have
this
morning
noon
and
night
just
has
whatever
youre
in
the
mood
for
roast
toasty
sweet
nutty
and
hoppy
i
love
this
beer
and
must
have
more
16oz
can
what
a
solid
brew
out
of
a
can
my
ive
had
the
4
major
surlys
out
of
can
now
and
its
tough
to
decide
a
favorite
they
are
all
pretty
good
this
one
is
dark
and
rich
but
still
focused
you
dont
realize
it
comes
from
a
can
a
major
achievement
coffee
and
great
aroma
really
easy
to
drink
and
like
ive
said
about
other
surley
cans
great
price
and
quality
drinkability
okay
all
preconceived
notions
about
canned
beer
have
been
smashed
this
beer
is
great
i
either
need
to
move
to
minnesota
or
set
up
biweekly
shipments
from
packforever1976
how
about
minnesotans
who
wants
to
be
a
beer
mule
pours
brown
in
color
looks
a
little
thin
on
the
pour
and
has
clearruby
highlights
around
the
edges
smell
is
hops
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
even
more
of
the
hops
there
is
a
good
roasty
quality
and
some
coffee
as
well
the
oatmeal
really
smooths
this
beer
out
this
is
good
just
really
thin
for
my
liking
another
solid
beer
from
surly
but
its
no
furious
taste
is
crisp
and
tingly
slight
hoppiness
at
first
but
the
malt
quickly
takes
over
weird
aftertaste
that
i
cant
quite
place
but
it
doesnt
really
complement
the
beer
not
as
smooth
as
most
oatmeal
browns
this
beer
comes
off
to
me
as
a
cross
between
an
irish
stout
and
newcastle
very
dark
brown
boardering
on
black
nice
head
no
lace
good
retention
aroma
is
mild
with
a
sweet
malt
character
up
front
with
a
small
dose
of
citrus
hops
flavour
is
rather
bland
a
little
roasty
a
little
hoppy
and
kind
of
sweet
very
mild
bitterness
mouthfull
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
carbonation
is
medium
not
bad
by
any
means
big
thanks
to
objectivemonkey
for
bringing
this
to
lawrence
for
me
d
a
great
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
all
night
long
the
can
i
opened
however
didnt
quite
scream
world
class
brew
at
me
pours
to
a
golden
brown
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
somewhat
muted
even
as
it
warms
mostly
a
caramellike
maltiness
and
coffee
undertones
the
taste
does
not
dissapoint
with
the
malt
flavors
of
caramel
and
coffee
meeting
a
perfect
hit
of
hops
as
it
slides
to
a
nice
lingering
finish
this
is
scary
stuff
in
the
drinkability
department
my
tallboy
disappeared
in
no
time
flat
i
could
pound
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
without
a
problem
looking
forward
to
trying
more
surly
brews
all
around
a
very
solid
beer
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
d
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
its
light
enough
that
you
could
have
quite
a
few
will
need
to
find
more
drinkability
yet
another
very
sessionable
beer
from
surly
just
wish
i
could
get
ahold
of
this
more
often
proper
serving
temperature
is
key
with
this
one
ice
cold
and
its
mediocre
but
allow
it
to
warm
to
slightly
below
cellar
temperature
and
its
a
killer
drinker
with
some
substance
d
what
a
great
brown
ale
so
unique
great
flavors
and
definitely
worth
a
try
absolutely
delicious
d
very
smoothe
and
easy
drinking
niceley
balanced
flavors
at
5
1
alcohol
i
could
easily
do
a
session
of
this
beer
notes
one
of
the
best
browns
ive
had
makes
those
newcastle
boys
look
like
a
bunch
of
chumps
thanks
again
wankerweasal
for
the
trade
d
good
session
beer
d
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
taste
really
nice
and
goes
down
smooth
what
does
brown
do
for
you
in
this
case
brown
brown
ale
that
is
is
where
its
at
at
least
for
bender
certainly
some
suds
we
could
see
stocked
in
our
fridge
all
year
long
paired
well
with
teriyaki
beef
over
a
nutty
brown
rice
pours
a
rich
choclaty
brown
from
the
can
with
a
slightly
tan
head
that
melts
into
the
beer
leaving
a
little
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
doesnt
really
smell
too
complex
and
nothing
jump
out
right
away
taste
is
whoah
this
may
be
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
very
rich
and
creamy
just
the
right
balance
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
a
touch
of
the
right
amount
of
hops
makes
this
a
standout
beer
light
mouthfeel
and
extremely
drinkable
making
this
a
must
try
oh
how
i
envy
the
folks
in
minnesota
if
only
for
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
its
a
good
beer
very
solid
but
not
the
best
on
my
personal
list
of
brown
ales
color
is
a
translucent
mohogonymolasses
its
very
smooth
easy
drinking
a
great
session
beer
has
a
real
nice
flavorful
taste
hints
of
nuts
and
caramel
a
hoppy
bitterness
but
not
overwhelming
the
bitterness
develops
moreso
as
it
nears
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
taste
mouthfeel
go
through
stages
as
the
temperature
rises
it
doesnt
have
the
fullbodied
potency
i
had
hoped
expected
not
quite
thick
enough
for
my
personal
liking
nevertheless
its
a
very
enjoyable
brew
looking
forward
to
trying
a
few
others
from
surly
d
surprisingly
drinkable
for
such
a
dark
looking
beer
with
dark
flavors
easily
my
favorite
brown
ale
due
to
the
excellent
use
of
oatmeal
very
drinkable
of
the
two
readily
available
surly
beers
i
would
say
bender
is
more
impressive
black
in
color
with
a
thick
frothy
head
upon
pouring
into
a
pint
glass
prickle
is
present
on
the
side
of
the
glass
but
not
very
active
caramel
malt
nose
smooth
clean
attack
malty
flavor
with
a
growing
caramel
character
towards
the
finish
some
coffee
notes
i
would
say
a
b
on
my
own
flat
scale
compared
to
all
beers
eminently
drinkable
worthy
of
being
sessioned
all
night
long
damn
the

bought
while
on
a
trip
in

roasty

notes
burnt

nice
hop
bitterness
but
not
too
much
quite
tasty
creaminess
from
the
oats
is
nice
medium
to
full
bodied
for
the
style
overall
a
satisfying
spin
on
the
brown
ale
style
very
tasty
with
a
memorable
flavor
and
mouthfeel
poured
from
a
16oz
can
into
a
snifter
hazy
dark
brown
in
color
that
produced
a
tan
colored
head
and
leaving
generous
lacing
in
the
glass
initial
aroma
is
of
dark
chocolate
and
fruity
esters
taste
is
of
fudge
brownies
oatmeal
the
slightest
hop
bitterness
and
dark
fruits
such
as
raisins
and
plums
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
fullbodied
nice
carbonation
an
all
around
excellent
american
brown
ale
surly
has
done
it
again
thanks
for
the
trade
eric
dapeculierdane
like
some
of
surlys
other
beers
this
seems
like
a
unique
take
on
a
couple
of
different
styles
but
it
all
works
out
quite
nicely
in
the
end
i
had
a
bit
of
an
issue
with
the
nose
but
for
the
most
part
this
was
one
extremely
flavorful
and
incredible
drinking
brown
ale
i
nearly
ran
out
of
beer
before
i
could
finish
reviewing
it
was
that
quaffable
very
delicious
brew
from
surly
borderline
dry
stout
as
it
finishes
pretty
dry
with
emphasis
on
the
bitter
malt
flavors
drinkability
wow
this
is
very
tasty
perhaps
my
favorite
brown
ale
and
that
is
saying
a
lot
brown
ales
are
not
typically
a
style
that
i
frequently
reach
for
but
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
huge
nose
decent
flavor
low
abv
smooth
creaminess
makes
for
a
great
tasting
easy
drinking
beer
benders
a
very
unique
and
excellent
brown
ale
clearly
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
for
the
style
its
as
good
as
i
can
imagine
it
being
done
once
again
im
left
feeling
disappointed
that
surlys
distribution
is
so
limited
if
youre
in
minnesota
count
your
blessings
if
youre
not
start
your
search
for
surly
beers
immediately
the
taste
starts
tart
crisp
with
dark
chocolate
cocoa
bitterness
hop
profile
is
suttle
semibitterness
strong
burnt
coffee
roasted
flavor
profile
dominates
this
beer
the
flavor
is
nice
sweer
oats
bitter
nice
beer
strong
roasted
flavors
dominate
this
beer
overall
very
nice
offering
i
could
drink
this
brew
til
the
cows
came
home
its
delicious
not
topo
strong
and
surprisingly
light
fantastic
brew
d
a
good
solid
beer
great
taste
and
highly
sessionable
but
once
again
i
was
expecting
more
in
the
hops
department
so
it
suffers
just
a
little
bit
over
all
in
my
scoring
d
super
easy
drinking
beer
would
love
to
have
this
as
a
local
drinkability
very
impressed
with
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
its
certainly
a
mixture
of
two
distinct
styles
that
offers
the
best
of
both
worlds
for
lovers
of
both
styles
pick
it
up
drinkability
very
enjoyable
thanks
to
wankerweasel
for
the
cans
while
these
are
safe
to
take
to
the
pool
as
is
ill
have
to
bring
a
solo
cup
along
or
something
it
just
wont
be
right
to
keep
this
in
the
can
this
does
blur
style
guidelines
and
is
a
reflection
of
talent
and
craftsmanship
befitting
to
its
name
i
could
easily
drink
this
endlessly
day
and
night
drinkability
very
good
and
very
eccentric
ale
well
balanced
with
lots
of
stuff
going
on
would
have
again
for
sure
perfect
session
beer
imo
benders
superb
blend
of
flavor
tolerable
abv
and
drinkability
elevate
this
beyond
any
of
the
other
beers
in
the
style
that
ive
tried
d
really
good
definitely
a
session
beer
a
very
nice
brown
ale
this
is
my
first
surly
and
im
impressed
i
have
more
in
my
fridge
to
keep
me
waiting
in
anticipation
d
this
is
one
hell
of
a
sessionable
brown
ale
and
i
could
drink
it
all
night
long
extremely
well
balanced
and
easy
going
down
highly
recommended
d
5
this
is
a
great
beer
and
very
sessionable
very
nice
especially
freshly
poured
this
will
be
my
second
brew
from
surly
the
first
being
furious
thanks
to
danielphoran
for
the
four
pack
poured
in
to
a
tulip
glass
an
extremely
dark
color
for
a
brown
ale
very
dark
brown
with
a
tan
medium
sized
head
and
ruby
hues
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nose
has
lots
of
earthy
spice
hops
light
powdered
chocolate
definite
herbal
tea
smell
and
just
a
little
bit
of
coffee
taste
starts
off
on
a
very
earthy
hoppy
note
followed
by
a
nice
round
roasty
coffeetea
edge
and
finally
ending
on
a
bitter
note
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
of
flavor
and
leaves
the
palate
without
much
of
an
aftertaste
it
sort
of
comes
in
hits
you
with
a
ton
of
fllavor
and
then
leaves
as
if
it
were
never
there
usually
i
dont
find
darker
ales
to
fall
within
the
realm
of
session
beers
bit
this
one
might
be
an
exception
a
bit
more
body
on
this
one
and
you
might
be
venturing
in
to
porter
territory
surly
continues
to
impress
me
with
this
offering
if
only
i
lived
in
minnesota
cheers
thanks
for
hooking
it
up
zealot
decanted
from
the
can
into
a
pint
glass
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
sticks
around
smells
like
citrus
hops
with
caramel
malts
and
a
pleasant
nuttiness
underneath
tastes
very
interesting
first
theres
bitter
resiny
hops
then
the
malts
kick
in
with
a
nice
breadiness
and
a
little
caramel
mouthfeel
is
right
in
the
middle
and
smooth
drinkability
is
massively
high
as
this
beer
goes
down
extremely
easy
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
brown
ale
thats
been
hopped
up
to
ipa
levels
totally
into
it
dark
red
brown
with
a
nice
head
of
offwhitebeige
foam
aromas
of
steeped
deep
coffee
nice
roasted
malt
a
bit
of
chocolate
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
some
caramel
candy
taste
is
malty
and
roasty
up
front
with
some
coffee
and
a
tad
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
in
the
malt
profile
hopping
is
light
but
noticeable
and
blends
the
overall
flavour
very
well
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
but
not
thick
drinkability
really
remains
quite
awesome
for
a
brown
ale
one
of
the
best
browns
ive
had
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
as
peter
griffin
says
fricking
sweet
id
sell
my
mother
to
get
another
one
of
these
just
not
on
mothers
day
bender
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
good
light
tan
head
nice
lace
nose
is
very
malty
with
a
touch
of
schwarz
smell
nice
malty
taste
with
good
subtle
coffee
some
grain
ever
so
slight
roastiness
mouthfeel
is
good
a
little
dry
drinkability
is
quite
good
easily
poundable
a
good
brown
ale
but
i
dont
think
it
is
quite
as
spectacular
as
most
feel
it
is
a
solid
brew
defenitely
would
be
a
regular
if
it
was
local
i
would
much
rather
have
access
to
some
furious
though
good
beer
bender
in
the
can
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
on
tap
it
was
not
as
good
i
am
hoping
it
was
just
a
bad
keg
or
line
and
this
is
not
the
way
it
usually
is
but
this
is
all
i
have
to
go
on
got
this
one
in
minnesota
and
took
it
along
for
the
ride
16
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
looking
deep
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
fairly
weak
in
the
lacing
department
i
can
smell
is
across
the
room
tons
of
caramel
malt
spiced
up
with
delicious
funky
hops
lots
of
dried
fruit
aromas
floating
around
flavor
is
excellent
deep
roasted
malt
starts
it
off
interesting
lemony
hops
show
up
later
and
linger
make
sure
to
drink
this
one
warm
otherwise
youre
missing
on
the
real
fun
interesting
roasted
feel
to
the
hops
how
the
two
elements
mix
themselves
together
some
light
fruitiness
in
the
taste
as
well
body
is
full
and
delicious
creamy
and
with
a
perfect
spicy
carbonation
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
doesnt
really
touch
the
furious
in
my
mind
nor
is
it
quite
as
good
as
the
dfh
indian
brown
but
its
a
solid
effort
nonetheless
i
would
say
this
beer
is
almost
porter
like
in
smell
and
taste
im
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
but
this
one
was
darn
good
the
taste
is
somewhere
between
a
brown
ale
and
an
outmeal
stout
hinting
at
chocolate
and
dark
cherry
with
a
bunch
of
hops
thrown
in
to
give
it
a
citrus
overtone
with
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
tt
was
a
nice
surprise
that
i
enjoyed
quite
a
bit
smooth
creamy
and
would
be
an
awesome
go
to
beer
i
loved
this
beer
if
it
were
available
near
me
it
would
always
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
and
belly
a
very
good
brown
pours
a
deep
mahogany
very
little
head
smell
is
very
light
but
reminiscent
of
raisins
hints
of
vanilla
taste
is
nice
and
malty
some
fruity
notes
faint
coffee
or
tobacco
not
much
hops
bitterness
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
bit
drying
on
the
back
end
a
very
good
drinkable
brew
wish
this
was
distributed
in
my
area
id
definitely
pick
up
some
more
d
overall
a
nice
brown
ale
that
i
was
a
bit
surprised
to
find
such
a
strong
orange
taste
in
there
that
balances
against
the
sweeter
malts
i
was
a
bit
surprsied
as
to
how
much
the
orange
hop
flavor
shined
through
but
i
guess
i
shouldnt
have
been
given
surlys
love
of
hops
an
interesting
twist
and
i
will
enjoy
drinking
the
other
4
however
i
wont
really
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
some
more
a
good
deal
though
esp
for
the
price
definitely
a
well
made
beer
maybe
its
just
not
my
style
gotta
get
me
some
furious
d
a
delight
to
drink
4
55
d
great
session
beer
whould
agian
love
to
have
this
beer
in
my
area
but
i
will
definately
atempt
to
make
what
i
have
last
as
long
as
possible
not
making
any
promises
though
as
with
furious
by
the
same
brewer
i
cant
get
into
the
jesus
came
back
as
a
beer
hype
the
brewery
gets
yet
theres
no
denying
they
make
good
stuff
this
one
is
no
exception
bender
is
not
an
outstanding
beer
but
it
is
a
long
long
way
from
bad
well
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
in
their
distribtion
area
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
scent
with
just
enough
crystal
malts
to
add
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
roasted
and
crystal
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
real
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
metallic
edge
it
has
an
excellent
roasted
character
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
near
perfect
carbonation
this
a
very
good
drinking
beer
its
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
great
taste
and
aroma
thanks
again
to
jjayjaye
for
for
hooking
me
up
this
beer
poured
a
lovely
dark
brown
and
immediately
had
a
hint
of
banana
esters
it
was
lightly
nutty
with
some
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
overall
it
was
an
excellent
beer
and
the
best
ive
ever
had
out
of
a
can
i
only
wish
it
had
a
more
widespread
distribution
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
starts
of
malty
chocolate
nuts
toffee
then
the
hops
join
in
bitter
citrus
and
fruits
just
to
mix
it
up
a
little
a
rather
good
brown
up
there
with
my
local
goto
sixpoint
brownstone
cheers
to
mully
for
the
chance
to
try
it
this
would
make
for
an
incredible
session
beer
if
i
had
more
than
one
here
in
california
really
smooth
in
body
and
taste
pours
a
barely
translucent
dark
brown
with
mahogany
hues
and
a
nice
foamy
tan
head
that
resists
fading
it
leaves
good
amounts
of
sticky
lacing
patterns
behind
the
smell
is
really
nice
the
aroma
is
primarily
sweet
malty
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
theres
something
else
there
also
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
not
molasses
but
its
sending
thickness
signals
a
nice
tingle
of
carbonation
full
bodied
mouth
feel
with
pleasant
creamy
texture
that
finishes
with
a
gentle
note
of
hops
full
of
flavor
the
mouth
complements
the
tootsie
roll
chocolate
mixed
with
malt
shop
something
and
malted
milk
ball
whateveritis
an
easy
drinker
and
the
5
1
abv
makes
it
one
of
the
best
sessionable
things
going
on
and
i
bet
its
local
too
also
want
to
thank
pitmonkey
for
the
recent
trade
highly
recommended
d
heavier
in
the
stomach
that
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
several
of
these
in
1
sitting
smooth
enough
tho
that
im
not
going
to
share
my
pub
can
such
a
good
beer
again
from
surly
love
this
stuff
and
will
have
to
get
more
to
replenish
our
stash
cheers
rich
dark
brownblack
pour
with
a
big
lasting
tan
head
smell
is
very
smooth
and
muted
but
a
bit
sourish
as
if
not
quite
fresh
some
roasty
notes
in
there
as
well
nice
mouthfeel
smooth
creamy
and
perfectly
carbonated
flavor
is
nice
for
a
brown
not
intensely
flavorful
but
nice
and
malty
with
some
roastiness
and
oaty
creaminess
good
but
the
smell
killed
it
for
me
and
perhaps
it
just
wasnt
quite
fresh
dare
i
ask
could
this
be
a
great
sessions
beer
too
bad
i
cant
get
it
more
often
fyitheir
beers
arent
filtered
or
pasteurized
so
keep
em
cold
or
they
may
suffer
if
i
didnt
live
in
mn
i
would
have
to
move
here
for
this
beer
i
consider
bender
as
my
go
to
beer
for
any
drinking
occasion
wonderful
appearance
smell
taste
mouthfeel
etc
i
like
brown
ales
in
general
add
the
oatmeal
smoothness
and
light
hoppy
presense
and
this
is
a
great
drinker
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
stretches
the
limits
of
its
category
almost
creating
a
new
one
now
if
i
can
only
find
a
coffee
bender
tapping
overall
this
was
one
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
ever
had
it
was
richly
complex
and
sweet
and
very
full
bodied
very
cream
and
almost
porter
like
in
its
presentation
this
was
just
outstanding
not
only
would
i
not
turn
this
away
if
it
came
my
way
but
i
will
actively
seek
it
out
for
sure
go
get
this
it
really
is
a
winner
i
wish
surly
was
available
in
sc
this
would
be
a
goto
beer
for
me
extremely
tasty
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
highly
recommended
a
nice
touch
on
the
tongue
where
this
one
begins
a
bit
thin
but
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
well
taken
care
of
like
it
leaves
a
skim
around
the
mouth
keeping
the
flavor
going
an
going
i
could
see
haveing
a
few
of
these
but
the
jury
is
still
out
on
if
i
would
drink
it
all
day
or
night
i
love
the
drinkability
of
browns
and
the
hops
kind
of
ruins
that
but
who
knows
matt
thanks
again
ive
been
dying
to
try
surly
beers
and
you
were
the
hookup
lets
do
more
business
taste
layers
of
caramel
vanilla
and
cocoa
play
off
of
a
toasty
bittersweet
foundation
smooth
and
full
on
the
palate
with
a
dry
coffeelike
finish
impressive
complexity
without
compromising
drinkability
drinkability
is
amazingly
high
and
in
the
session
range
this
is
probably
the
most
flavorful
brown
ale
i
have
ever
had
the
oatmeal
cocoa
and
hops
are
all
so
wellbalanced
that
i
wish
i
had
better
access
to
surly
beers
looking
forward
to
more
of
their
beers
very
soon
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
with
the
tan
one
finger
head
that
recedes
fairly
quick
while
leaving
some
nice
lacing
smells
of
chocolate
caramel
roasted
malt
and
a
slight
hint
of
hops
taste
is
amazing
very
well
rounded
and
not
like
another
run
of
the
mill
brown
ale
you
might
expect
drinkability
is
excellent
i
can
easily
session
this
beer
during
disc
golf
tournaments
thank
you
surly
this
is
my
new
favorite
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
surly
goodies
if
theyre
anything
like
the
bender
ill
be
incredibly
impressed
sure
its
a
very
stoutlike
brown
ale
what
else
would
you
expect
from
this
brewery
and
besides
im
in
the
camp
that
says
the
average
brown
ale
could
use
a
kick
in
the
ass
heres
that
kick
in
the
ass
great
brown
ale
i
could
drink
these
all
night
real
easy
drinking
overall
a
little
bit
thicker
and
richer
than
most
brown
ales
i
have
had
nice
spin
on
the
style
and
an
all
around
good
brew
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
on
the
market
it
is
a
shame
it
is
so
hard
for
me
to
come
by
i
really
like
the
chocolate
tones
that
it
has
in
it
very
nice
d
this
is
my
second
surly
product
and
it
didnt
disappoint
d
so
smooth
and
tasty
i
could
drink
this
all
night
d
i
want
a
neverending
supply
of
this
d
very
good
had
this
on
tap
at
the
hopleaf
a
while
ago
i
liked
it
and
it
was
a
slightly
unusual
take
on
a
brown
ale
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
like
furious
did
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
head
that
fades
away
to
athin
cap
that
sticks
around
excellent
lacing
the
aromas
are
spicy
and
malty
up
front
almost
prickly
and
then
slightly
sweeter
and
more
roasty
on
the
finish
there
is
a
slight
sour
graininess
at
the
end
as
well
almost
porterlike
in
its
aromas
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
the
flavors
are
a
little
lighter
than
expected
from
the
nose
light
chocolate
light
roastiness
fresh
cream
and
a
light
grainy
flavor
at
the
end
rye
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
some
light
grainy
tannins
on
the
finish
a
good
effort
if
not
speectacular
goes
down
real
easy
d
so
good
highly
recommended
this
is
a
hopheads
brown
ale
yet
still
has
a
great
smoothness
and
complex
malt
backbone
go
find
some
and
drink
it
thanks
to
pitmonkey
for
the
opportunity
pours
an
impressive
black
that
is
actually
a
deep
amberbrown
when
held
up
to
the
light
an
off
white
12
inch
head
meets
the
top
of
my
imperial
pint
glass
the
nose
seems
kind
of
weak
but
i
do
enjoy
the
presence
of
the
hops
in
there
as
i
do
in
most
beers
maybe
i
have
it
too
cold
but
all
i
can
really
pick
out
is
a
light
presence
of
some
roasted
chocolate
taste
is
much
more
complex
nice
bitterness
up
front
that
transforms
to
a
bitter
chocolate
that
moves
onto
a
subtle
roasted
sweetness
and
silky
all
the
wayh
through
a
very
balanced
and
layered
beer
despite
my
3
5
in
the
smell
category
would
make
one
hell
of
a
session
beer
a
big
thanks
to
faro
for
sending
me
this
brew

served
slightly
chilled
in
an
imperial
pint
glass
from
a
sixteen
ounce
can
poured
out
a
deep
dark
brown
that
had
some
garnet
highlights
almost
two
fingers
of
thinnish
bubbly
tan
head
decent
retention
on
this
one
leaving
some
thin
streaky
lace
on
the
glass
nose
was
a
bit
fruity
hoppy
and
malty
with
an
almost
woody
aroma
tucked
away
nicely
in
the
background
taste
was
quite
malty
with
a
bit
of
plum
in
there
just
a
tiny
bit
of
noticeable
hops
in
the
taste
even
a
bit
of
underlying
coffee
brown
sugary
sweetness
and
a
thick
nuttiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
just
enough
carbonation
very
good
drinkability
very
balanced
in
both
smell
and
taste
smooth
is
the
first
word
that
comes
to
mind
roasted
slightly
sweet
malts
with
a
perfect
balance
of
hops
a
little
watery
on
the
mouthfeel
but
for
the
style
not
bad
a
supremely
drinkable
solid
beer
d
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
not
only
is
it
tasty
but
at
5
you
can
easily
throw
a
few
back
without
worrying
about
passing
out
face
down
on
the
floor
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
oatmeal
yet
kind
of
bland
in
the
taste
sweet
oatmeal
and
somewhat
malty
a
decent
bitterness
in
the
mouthfeel
and
a
sweet
malty
aftertaste
interesting
brown
with
the
oatmeal
presence
smooth
and
a
small
bitterness
i
came
in
expecting
a
brown
ale
but
got
something
a
little
off
center
it
was
tasty
regardless
thank
you
aaron
the
overall
uniqueness
of
this
beer
has
me
very
intrigued
and
wanting
more
this
is
a
session
beer
for
me
was
the
perfect
post
diner
beer
i
love
surly
discovered
it
while
drinking
with
a
friend
back
in
minneapolis
a
shame
i
live
in
ny
now
mouthfeelbitterness
followed
by
a
killer
brown
ale
flavor
the
bitterness
gives
way
to
a
sweet
roasted
malt
flavor
towards
the
finish
a
froth
on
the
palate
intensifies
the
hops
and
releases
some
chocolate
and
espresso
flavors
some
vanilla
flavors
come
through
also
almost
like
an
sweet
indian
brown
ale
very
tasty
and
drinkable
looking
forward
to
more
surly
overall
i
had
this
for
breakfast
and
sht
it
was
good
i
cant
believe
i
was
in
mn
last
year
and
didnt
get
any
of
this
1
of
the
best
canned
beers
ive
had
so
far
thanks
so
much
tayner
they
came
and
went
quickly
this
is
a
top
notch
brown
ale
good
stuff
funky
packaging
more
head
than
body
with
a
strong
pour
deep
ruby
brown
body
hosts
a
thick
foamy
light
tan
head
with
nice
staying
power
nose
is
full
of
spicey
zest
and
yeasty
malt
enters
the
mouth
with
a
nice
mingling
of
hops
and
rich
roasted
oats
slightly
burnt
malt
gives
almost
a
coffee
like
after
taste
hops
have
a
little
bite
on
the
end
of
the
palate
this
is
a
unique
brew
that
i
could
drink
everyday
and
that
would
go
with
a
variety
of
foods
boldly
drinkable
with
a
very
bitter
rich
mouthfeel
deep
dark
brown
in
appearance
with
a
thick
head
aromas
of
coffee
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
hops
taste
of
chocolate
coffee
popcorn
roasted
malts
and
a
small
bit
of
citrus
to
finish
it
off
mouth
fell
is
slick
and
light
drinkability
is
definitely
easy
all
brown
ales
should
taste
this
good
highly
recommended
d
i
know
its
not
the
same
style
but
i
just
want
to
say
guinness
eat
your
heart
out
the
drinkability
of
this
is
everything
guinness
draught
wishes
it
could
be
note
after
drinking
this
beer
i
know
why
it
is
rated
amongst
the
best
for
the
style
drinkability
well
crafted
brew
that
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
hope
this
will
have
wider
availability
in
the
future
the
beer
poured
from
the
can
into
my
sniffer
sported
a
clear
ruby
brown
color
i
really
enjoyed
the
aroma
of
this
beer
it
had
a
sweet
grainy
quality
with
fruity
tones
the
flavor
had
an
upfront
hop
presence
with
toasted
grains
and
a
slight
sour
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
off
because
of
a
lack
of
carbonation
to
be
fair
the
beer
was
on
the
warm
side
and
the
can
had
been
open
for
a
little
while
but
nevertheless
this
is
what
i
tasted
all
together
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beverage
i
like
the
concept
of
canned
micros
not
to
sound
snobby
but
its
been
month
since
ive
had
a
beer
from
a
can
nice
to
see
it
can
be
done
without
compromising
on
flavor
overall
i
have
heard
rave
reviews
about
surly
and
i
can
see
why
the
guys
over
there
can
brew
great
beers
no
doubt
about
it
furious
is
so
big
and
aggressive
and
this
one
left
me
saying
this
is
what
a
brown
should
be
cheers
to
obmonkey
for
sending
a
bevy
of
surly
brews
over
i
will
kill
for
a
growler
of
darkness
im
begging
name
your
price
eh
beer
it
is
drinkable
and
i
could
drink
many
of
these
if
that
was
the
session
beer
of
the
night
but
i
wouldnt
seek
them
out
this
is
my
second
favorite
surly
beer
behind
the
furious
i
am
not
huge
on
brown
ales
which
is
why
i
did
not
rate
this
higher
but
this
is
my
fav
it
is
very
drinkable
and
you
can
definately
taste
the
carmel
the
4
0
for
mouthfeel
is
becaue
it
was
good
but
i
think
it
could
be
fuller
drinkability
i
could
put
back
a
few
of
these
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
its
dark
but
not
to
dark
its
complex
but
not
too
complex
it
would
be
nice
to
have
this
one
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
pours
near
black
with
dark
brown
highlights
thick
creamy
khaki
colored
head
malty
aroma
consists
of
cocoa
and
chocolate
with
hints
of
fruit
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
thats
fairly
smooth
some
carbonation
around
the
edges
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavor
initially
very
smooth
some
burnt
malt
appears
toward
the
middle
and
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
nicely
done
bottom
line
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
that
ive
tried
to
date
highly
recommended
d
not
the
quickest
drinker
but
the
thicker
body
is
the
x
factor
there
you
gotta
try
it
cause
¬ñ
this
is
one
great
canned
beer
meant
for
a
glass
lightweight
shipping
no
light
struck
problems
perfect
size
of
16oz
¬ñ
the
way
of
the
future
i
apologize
for
the
comparison
i
made
above
bender
does
not
deserve
to
have
such
garbage
mentioned
in
its
review
needless
to
say
this
is
clearly
the
best
canned
beer
ive
ever
had
and
its
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ive
had
in
awhile
overall
now
how
am
i
going
to
get
more
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
decent
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
an
evening
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
i
could
certainly
enjoy
throwing
back
a
few
of
them
highly
recommended
and
hopefully
i
will
get
to
try
the
tea
bagged
bourbon
barrel
and
coffee
versions
of
this
on
draft
someday
medium
body
moderately
carbonated
and
a
nice
crisp
slightly
dry
quality
this
is
a
pretty
easy
beer
to
drink
its
good
for
a
taking
a
decent
amount
of
time
with
but
also
for
just
kicking
back
and
having
a
couple
one
of
the
more
drinkable
brown
ales
out
there
this
is
one
that
you
can
drink
all
night
if
you
wish
this
isnt
quite
as
good
as
dfh
indian
brown
though
drinkablity
off
the
charts
i
could
easily
put
down
a
six
pack
of
these
16
ounce
cans
without
thinking
twice
this
may
have
passed
old
chub
as
my
favorite
beer
in
a
can
hell
this
may
have
surpassed
almost
all
dark
beers
i¬íve
had
so
unique
and
absurdly
balanced
really
sucks
i
only
have
one
left
thanks
again
to
mnstorm99
spectacular
beer
drinkability
i
think
i
could
drink
about
60
of
these
in
a
sitting
so
id
say
its
pretty
drinkable
fantastic
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
pint
glass
and
it
looked
perfect
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
foam
the
aroma
was
near
perfect
too
sweetly
malty
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
was
very
nice
complex
in
that
there
were
sweet
malt
flavors
and
bitter
malt
roasted
flavors
both
mixing
together
with
an
aftertaste
similar
to
a
chocolate
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
enough
to
make
this
seem
like
a
meal
very
very
nice
brown
ale
maybe
my
favorite
brown
ale
mouthfeel
is
very
good
almost
silky
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
possibly
the
best
brown
ale
ive
tasted
overalli
wish
more
browns
were
like
tis
one
really
complex
and
malty
liek
a
brown
should
be
bu
with
a
good
dose
of
roasted
barely
and
hops
to
liven
things
up
appears
clear
dark
brown
with
rich
ruby
red
hues
in
the
light
12
inch
of
thick
lasting
tan
head
covers
the
glass
with
great
lacing
smells
of
caramel
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
grassy
hops
taste
is
almost
more
of
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
with
bitter
cocoa
and
caramel
beginnings
coffee
and
a
grassy
hop
finish
medium
in
body
and
very
smooth
with
low
carbonation
my
first
surly
brew
but
definitely
not
my
last
one
of
the
best
canned
beers
ive
ever
had
surprisingly
rich
for
a
brown
ale
brown
ales
are
not
my
style
but
the
hoppiness
really
make
this
more
appealing
to
me
definately
will
continue
to
consume
this
great
beer
in
the
funky
16oz
can
d
the
abv
is
low
enough
that
this
is
easily
a
session
beer
a
nice
drink
from
surly
who
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
recommend
it
to
anyone
i
usually
dont
think
of
a
brown
ale
with
spicy
food
but
i
think
that
this
one
would
accompany
spicy
food
nicely
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
thin
the
drinkability
was
very
good
i
think
it
was
best
when
it
was
really
cold
excellent
brown
ale
and
something
i
will
get
more
of
as
a
hop
lover
this
is
not
a
style
that
normally
gets
my
attention
but
this
one
certainly
did
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
a
bit
powdery
and
tannic
but
satisfying
way
way
way
drinkable
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
many
many
thanks
to
buckeyenation
for
sending
this
one
my
way
overall
a
tasty
and
highly
quaffable
brown
ale
complex
two
best
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
truly
great
beer
for
a
style
that
is
often
overlooked
overall
a
highly
enjoyable
brew
ill
have
to
seek
out
more
offerings
from
this
brewery
i
love
the
16
oz
cans
also
quite
good
16
oz
can
the
beer
is
a
solid
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
settles
out
at
just
a
coating
over
top
clarity
looks
good
and
there
is
almost
no
carbonation
seen
in
the
brew
the
aroma
is
light
roast
with
a
mild
nuttyness
with
caramel
sweetness
throughout
the
flavor
is
more
forceful
than
the
aroma
initial
flavor
is
nuttyness
with
nice
roast
hitting
behind
that
it
then
goes
to
a
caramel
and
nut
again
finishing
with
a
mild
citrus
and
pine
hop
and
bitter
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
minimal
carbonation
this
one
is
tasty
it
brings
a
lot
of
flavor
and
is
a
nice
brown
ale
i
would
have
this
one
again
for
sure
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
dies
pretty
quick
and
leaves
lacing
smells
very
mild
of
toast
malt
and
cocoa
tastes
a
tiny
bit
of
chocolate
notes
roasted
nuts
a
citrusy
rind
and
some
nice
hops
at
the
finish
this
is
very
tasty
and
different
for
a
brown
ale
as
it
finishes
with
some
bitter
hops
feels
crisp
very
smooth
and
lively
in
the
mouth
from
carbonation
very
drinkable
this
is
a
light
delicious
and
different
brew
well
done
surly
the
color
was
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
higlights
against
a
strong
light
it
had
an
large
beige
head
that
slowly
settled
to
a
constant
film
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
roasted
malts
toffee
and
a
little
coffee
for
a
brown
it
has
a
really
good
smell
the
taste
was
awesome
from
the
1st
drink
i
knew
i
had
to
start
trading
for
more
it
starts
with
a
light
hop
bite
then
the
malts
kick
in
with
a
great
slightly
roasted
bitter
finish
had
a
great
balance
this
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
also
would
be
a
great
beer
to
try
on
your
friends
who
are
looking
to
trade
up
in
taste
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
gonna
have
to
find
more
highly
recommend
would
be
heavy
rotation
if
avail
here
im
surprised
to
see
this
is
a
brown
ale
because
i
had
it
on
tap
and
it
looked
and
tasted
like
a
stout
as
such
it¬ís
just
ok

and
lightly
roasted
malts
dominate
some

this
was
a
very
unique
and
intense
brown
ale
few
others
in
its
category
even
come
close
to
displaying
the
complexities
found
in
this
brew
i
only
wish
it
were
available
in
my
part
of
the
country

welcome
and
congrats
to
surly
for
standing
the
test
of
times
of
starting
a
micro
brewery
in
the
mn
metro
a
very
nice
start
im
sure
more
is
to
come
this
is
exactly
how
a
coffee
beer
should
be
if
you
didnt
know
you
would
swear
its
coffee
not
beer
imo
nice
brown
color
very
clear
nice
head
to
this
beer
with
good
head
retention
very
nice
coffee
aroma
followed
by
malt
wish
it
was
easier
to
get
this
in
va
honestly
it
doesnt
taste
like
beer
in
the
slightest
i
feel
like
im
drinking
black
coffee
whipped
up
and
served
cold
i
rarely
say
this
but
i
would
love
to
try
a
ba
version
of
this
i
love
coffee
beers
and
this
is
up
at
the
top
pours
a
light
shade
of
brown
with
a
white
head
aroma
of
fresh
coffee
grounds
and
malts
the
taste
has
big
ground
coffee
flavor
and
light
malts
coffee
all
day
creamy
with
a
delicate
nutty
flavor
underneath
the
coffee
medium
bodies
fair
carbonation
i
love
surly
beers
and
coffee
so
this
was
a
win
very
delicious
smooth
and
rich
coffee
is
dominant
here
but
its
not
over
the
top
either
which
is
a
surprise
from
something
with
coffee
right
in
the
name
tasted
beery
smelt
very
much
like
coffee
overall
a
good
beer
i
look
forward
to
drinking
it
once
again
doesnt
appear
very
big
but
it
packs
a
solid
coffee
punch
big
thanks
to
alexander
for
this
one
unquestionably
the
best
nonba
coffee
beer
ive
ever
had
woah
this
is
great
coffee
flavor
top
notch
brown
ale
this
american
brown
ale
style
brew
pours
a
very
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
some
reddish
highlights
a
good
3finger
foamy
beige
head
is
seen
after
the
pour
a
good
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
sticks
to
the
inside
of
the
mug
the
aroma
is
of
freshly
roasted
coffee
beans
for
the
most
part
you
can
smell
this
across
the
room
even
pretty
much
is
said
for
the
taste
also
if
you
like
black
coffee
then
this
is
for
you
lots
of
flavor
does
finish
slighter
bitter
as
would
be
excepted
but
doesnt
last
long
mediumbodied
and
perfect
carbonation
first
beer
i
had
the
first
time
i
ever
went
to
minnesota
will
never
forget
you
coffee
bender
so
much
coffee
if
you
like
iced
coffee
this
is
for
you
and
i
do
like
iced
coffee
pours
from
the
can
a
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
reduces
quickly
the
aroma
tells
you
quickly
that
its
coffee
coffee
and
more
coffee
so
it
tastes
like
well
coffee
theres
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
medium
mouth
and
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
i
taste
very
little
of
the
bender
base
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
porter
or
thin
coffee
stout
its
good
but
not
what
i
expected
very
good
flavor
some
coffee
beers
taste
like
a
coffee
filter
not
this
one
i
didnt
care
for
this
as
much
as
the
regular
bender
more
bitter
than
a
plain
brown
but
not
from
the
coffee
too
much
roasted
flavor
for
my
palate

it

mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
when
compared
to
the
big
coffee

not
in

me

fine
since
thats
the
ways
its

very
good

my
favorite
nonbarrel
aged
coffee
flavored
beer
got
this
coffee
beer
in
16
oz
cans
as
a
souvenir
while
travelling
in
minnesota
after
having
had
surlys
furious
pours
a
chocolate
brown
with
a
beige
head
aroma
is
fairly
intense
fresh
ground
coffee
with
a
little

nice
and
smooth

chocolate
and

grass
taste
goes
down
easily
calling
for
quaff
after
quaff
no
sipping
here
down
the
hatch
classed
as
a
american
brown
i
think
of
it
more
as
a
coffee
porter
and
even
more
so
as
awesome
nice
job
surly
a
real
unique
coffee
beer
in
comparison
to
the
others
on
the
shelves
these
days
very
easy
drinking
and
an
outstanding
breakfast
beer
especially
if
you
had
a
long
night
pairs
amazing
with
pancakes
and
real
maple
syrup
with
a
side
of
bacon
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
with
a
thinner
slight
off
white
head
atop
full
on
coffee
in
the
nosenot
beerish
at
all
reallyif
your
into
coffee
this
is
it
the
beer
is
good
very
good
but
the
coffee
is
dominant
and
it
maybe
leaves
the
fact
that
its
a
beer
behindbesides
the
coffee
on
the
palate
i
get
some
chocolate
and
mild
caramel
i
have
had
alot
of
coffee
infused
beers
this
cuts
the
cake
as
far
as
coffee
goesis
it
caffeinatedthats
the
question
the
body
was
pretty
nice
just
a
bit
thinner
than
i
prefer
in
a
brown
ale
but
smooth
except
for
some
coffee
bitterness
at
the
back
end
drinkability
will
totally
depend
on
your
view
of
coffee
you
can
figure
out
where
im
at
overall
a
solid
brew
and
one
that
a
lot
of
people
would
love
im
not
one
of
those
people
i
just
didnt
enjoy
the
beer
but
im
thankful
for
the
gift
and
for
the
experience
for
having
tried
it
ymmv
good
coffee
stout
with
a
big
coffee
taste
if
you
want
one
of
the
better
coffee
stouts
grab
some
of
these
coffee
bender
is
unique
enjoyable
and
quite
delectable
if
you
are
in
minnesota
you
really
need
to
try
this
one
had
it
on
tap
at
the
tipsy
cow
this
beer
tasted
just
like
drinking
black
coffee
it
was
good
but
i
like
coffee
stouts
and
porters
more
this
brew
just
smells
like
freshly
brewed
coffee
and
tastes
almost
the
exact
same
way
probably
the
most
coffeeforward
beer
ive
had
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
as
well
this
is
an
absolutely
phenomenal
beer
that
needs
to
be
purchased
if
you
see
it
even
at
the
price
i
got
it
for
lucious
fabulous
amounts
of
coffee
damn
i
just
wish
i
could
get
this
in
michigan
wow
wow
and
wow
o
i
want
to
like
this
a
lot
more
than
i
do
but
the
cold
pressed
coffee
is
a
little
too
upfront
and
pushes
the
beer
out
of
balance
that
characteristic
could
certainly
be
appealing
for
some
drinkers
would
love
to
taste
this
base
brown
ale
with
no
or
more
balanced
coffee
addition
overall3
25
i
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
once
i
get
past
the
initial
reaction
to
the
thin
body
the
flavor
is
coffeeheavy
but
offers
enough
malty
flavors
to
be
multilayered
4
05
o
i
am
impressed
but
not
chomping
at
the
bit
to
get
my
hands
on
more
this
is
definitely
a
cool
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
because
ive
not
had
anything
quite
like
this
o
the
bitterness
is
a
nice
counterpoint
to
the
dark
sweet
molasses
bread
taste
i
will
seek
this
out
whenever
im
in
an
area
surly
is
distributed
good
appearance
much
like
the
regular
bender
deep
dark
brown
but
still
clear
when
held
to
the
light
a
mediumsized
offwhite
head
held
for
a
few
minutes
and
sank
to
a
ringlet
leaving
a
few
dabs
of
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
full
of
coffee
with
lesser
notes
of
caramel
malts
taste
was
pure
straightup
bitter
black
coffee
and
nothing
else
just
blew
me
away
and
made
me
cringe
theres
a
good
way
of
using
coffee
in
a
beer
but
for
me
this
isnt
it
i
pretty
much
hate
coffee
unless
its
in
beer
then
i
actually
like
it
a
lot
but
when
i
do
have
a
coffee
beer
i
want
a
coffee
beer
not
a
cold
can
of
pure
coffee
this
was
bitter
acrid
onedimensional
and
lacking
any
sense
of
balance
i
literally
could
not
drink
this
but
if
you
love
cold
bitter
coffee
get
as
much
of
this
as
you
can
drinkability
this
beer
delivers
if
you
only
have
one
or
two
not
something
you
want
to
hang
out
with
all
night
clean
finish
and
great
on
a
hot
day
slightly
heavy
but
enjoyable
o
good
beer
there
is
something
about
coffee
taste
in
this
beer
that
im
not
100
sold
on
i
love
coffee
and
beer
but
this
combo
results
in
good
not
great
for
me
i
cannot
really
compare
this
beer
to
anything
else
open
you
mind
and
give
it
a
go
i
drank
from
the
can
and
from
a
tulip
side
by
side
can
lends
a
more
creamy
mouthfeel
big
dissipation
on
the
pourtoo
watery
i
find
no
difference
on
ipas
from
can
vs
glass
but
i
preferred
the
can
here
give
it
a
try
be
interested
to
hear
what
other
ppl
think
o
definitely
worth
trying
you
will
not
find
more
realistic
coffee
flavors
in
a
beer
unfortunately
i
think
they
spent
too
much
time
on
extracting
this
flavor
and
not
enough
time
working
on
the
other
components
to
back
it
up
delicious
get
some
overall
one
of
the
best
coffee
beers
ive
had
really
does
a
good
job
getting
actual
coffee
flavor
from
the
beans
rather
than
just
bitterness
and
roastiness
overall
in
case
you
havent
figured
it
out
this
is
a
beer
for
coffee
lovers
or
at
least
coffee
beer
lovers
so
if
thats
not
your
thing
you
should
definitely
stay
away
that
being
said
while
this
is
a
pretty
one
dimensional
beer
which
did
effect
my
scoring
its
done
about
as
well
as
one
could
imagine
if
you
like
coffee
beers
you
need
to
seek
this
out
overall
very
enjoyable
for
a
coffee
lover
but
could
be
a
huge
disappointment
for
someone
looking
for
a
stout
with
coffee
in
the
background
really
was
expecting
more
because
of
the
hype
what
you
get
here
is
a
palatable
coffee
brew
not
a
fan
of
the
base
bender
mainly
because
of
the
lightness
of
it
this
follows
the
same
thread
but
in
this
case
quality
coffee
has
been
added
to
make
it
a
gem
in
its
own
right
if
you
love
a
coffee
brew
then
this
is
one
you
will
like
i
absolutely
am
ashamed
for
not
having
enjoyed
this
beer
as
others
apparently
do
so
i
may
blame
this
review
on
an
off
can
or
something
im
actually
a
casual
fan
of
iced
coffee
but
there
was
something
really
wrong
and
burnt
tasting
about
the
coffee
profile
at
hand
its
ability
to
overpower
the
good
base
beer
didnt
help
the
cause
any
further
however
ill
gladly
revisit
this
if
someone
pushes
for
it
but
this
really
wasnt
for
me
at
all
an
incredibly
satisfying
coffee
infused
beer
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
fact
that
i
am
willing
to
drive
3
hours
to
get
it
should
tell
you
something
if
youre
able
to
get
your
hands
on
this
there
is
no
reason
you
shouldnt
568
ml
can
sampled
pours
a
dark
brown
with
little
head
smells
straightup
like
coffee
the
real
grounds
the
actual
stuff
roasted
just
pure
intense
actual
coffee
no
beer
ingredients
interesting
taste
is
straight
up
iced
coffee
like
a
glass
of
iced
coffee
with
some
ice
cubes
carbonation
roasted
grounds
coffee
beans
light
chocolate
caramel
easy
to
drink
this
is
more
coffee
than
beer
i
am
not
a
coffee
drinker
but
one
doesnt
need
to
be
that
to
enjoy
iced
coffee
i
quite
liked
this
cheap
in
4packs
i
would
buy
this
regularly
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
tastes
really
nice
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
coffee
beer
ive
had
i
dont
drink
coffee
so
this
is
the
only
way
i
get
coffee
and
ill
have
some
of
this
anytime
hard
to
say
much
bad
about
this
beer
enjoy
it
if
you
can
overall
this
is
the
most
coffee
ive
ever
tasted
in
a
beer
thats
a
good
thing
if
you
even
remotely
enjoy
coffee
you
would
love
this
i
know
i
did
o
i
love
this
beer
it
is
a
perfect
change
of
pace
beer
that
is
wellbalanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
ingredients
this
will
not
be
my
last
overall
this
is
possibly
the
best
brown
ale
that
is
brewed
with
coffee
surly
hit
a
homerun
this
this
beer
nuff
said
dont
hesitate
to
buy
this
beer
even
at
15
for
a
4pack
of
tallboys
you
wont
regret
your
purchase
i
promise
o
really
nice
to
go
back
to
this
one
the
one
and
only
other
time
i
had
this
was
a
few
years
ago
when
surly
was
in
the
chicago
area
on
tap
only
i
wonder
what
this
would
be
like
as
a
nitro
tap
just
a
thought
i
really
dig
this
beer
obviously
coffee
forward
doesnt
leave
much
for
the
standard
beer
drinker
im
not
a
brown
ale
kind
o
guy
but
this
brown
oatmeal
coffee
ale
is
tops
also
best
coffee
forward
beer
ive
had
i
absolutely
must
have
another
o
a
very
nice
experience
a
well
crafted
blend
of
coffee
beans
and
ale
it
strongly
resembles
an
iced
black
coffee
with
beer
a
great
combination
this
is
not
an
everyday
beer
but
when
the
time
is
right
this
ale
hits
the
spot
i
find
this
does
wonders
for
hangovers
can
from
trade
and
forget
who
but
thanks
pours
to
my
tulip
brown
with
some
ruby
red
showing
through
in
the
pour
as
it
accumulates
in
the
glass
it
ends
up
very
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
khaki
head
thats
looks
very
creamy
aroma
is
a
giant
smack
of
coffee
beans
maybe
a
hint
of
nutty
brown
ale
in
there
flavor
comes
in
with
surprise
big
coffee
earthy
and
spicy
as
can
be
and
nearly
like
liquid
espresso
beans
there
is
a
light
nutty
and
malt
character
mixed
in
there
but
it
is
certainly
subdued
there
is
a
small
hint
of
bittering
cocoa
powder
as
well
the
mouthfeel
on
this
is
on
the
thin
side
and
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
either
a
bit
more
thickness
to
this
or
more
carbonation
as
is
the
carbonation
is
a
low
medium
to
low
it
makes
it
sort
of
sit
deadened
on
the
tongue
nevertheless
the
coffee
flavor
here
is
massive
and
this
is
rather
enjoyable
o
i
enjoyed
it
and
will
have
it
again
what
i
love
about
coffee
bender
is
its
drinkablity
and
intense
coffee
smells
and
flavors
its
more
coffee
heavy
than
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
yet
it
drinks
real
easy
and
could
work
as
an
all
day
beverage
the
color
is
dark
brown
but
lighter
than
porter
its
got
some
transparency
to
it
and
has
a
fading
inch
of
off
white
head
the
nose
is
all
coffee
earthy
and
bitter
even
a
little
fruity
like
blueberries
but
there
is
very
little
acidity
there
is
also
some
brown
ale
style
chocolate
malt
but
the
coffee
dominates
same
in
the
flavor
its
all
coffee
start
to
finish
just
enough
beer
here
to
give
some
backbone
but
this
is
almost
indistinguishable
from
a
cup
of
coffee
at
least
in
beer
terms
the
cold
pressing
really
helps
the
feel
stay
light
and
refreshing
and
the
caffeine
is
detectable
clean
though
not
long
bitter
in
the
finish
just
sharp
enough
carbonated
well
medium
body
seems
lighter
a
four
pack
of
these
would
be
a
nice
dose
i
think
a
good
beer
to
start
a
big
night
with
as
well
i
have
loved
everything
from
surly
and
i
love
this
too
the
taste
is
of
perhaps
the
most
coffee
tasting
beer
ive
ever
had
unlike
many
other
coffee
beers
which
are
often
stouts
this
is
a
lot
thinner
and
really
just
seems
a
lot
like
an
iced
coffee
i
read
about
how
its
made
and
it
is
apparently
steeped
in
coffee
beans
for
24
hours
it
certainly
shows
if
youre
looking
for
deep
complexity
in
a
coffee
beer
id
say
to
keep
looking
if
you
want
a
beer
thats
really
a
dead
ringer
for
a
cold
coffee
beverage
that
youd
get
at
a
coffee
shop
here
you
are
o
my
first
surly
offering
and
i
think
for
a
coffee
brown
ale
they
did
a
great
job
overall
really
outstanding
beer
as
i
stated
it
is
a
bit
light
on
the
abv
but
this
is
an
excellent
year
round
beer
i
could
imagine
drinking
this
in
the
summer
considering
how
light
refreshing
and
crisp
it
is
odwasnt
super
impressed
with
bender
but
coffee
bender
is
a
beautiful
brew
the
genuine
coffee
flavor
is
impeccable
i
loved
this
beer
bottom
line
buy
if
you
like
coffee
surly
or
experimental
beers
taste
or
buy
a
single
if
youre
unsure
of
any
of
those
things
or
are
just
getting
into
brown
ales
dont
buy
if
you
have
any
problem
with
coffee
oloved
the
coffee
in
this
beer
more
than
any
other
i
can
recall
would
definitely
drink
this
againa
overall
like
drinking
a
fresh
cold
growler
of
coffee
the
nose
reminded
me
a
lot
of
spicy
used
coffee
grounds
bender
was
a
great
fit
for
this
beer
in
that
its
the
perfect
creamy
nutty
base
beer
i
just
wish
more
of
it
would
come
through
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
odd
veggie
smelltaste
that
threw
off
all
the
nice
coffee
complexities
nice
creamy
body
thought
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
heft
overall
a
recommend
ale
for
all
who
enjoy
coffee
in
their
beer
if
this
was
local
to
me
i
can
see
myself
picking
up
a
four
pack
off
and
on
o
i
love
coffee
from
the
first
smell
to
the
last
drink
it
lived
up
to
its
name
a
very
fun
play
on
an
american
brown
ale
it
was
really
one
note
for
me
though
the
smoke
was
a
fun
surprise
but
it
lacked
a
rounded
out
flavor
i
searched
and
searched
for
a
nuttieness
or
balancing
sweet
note
but
came
up
short
the
slight
toffee
taste
was
less
than
redeeming
o
one
of
the
best
all
time
coffee
beers
very
critical
of
coffee
beers
and
this
delivers
big
time
only
down
side
is
that
i
did
not
buy
more
notes
not
a
brew
for
the
ages
but
this
is
quite
nice
one
needs
to
be
in
the
mood
and
liking
the
coffee
edge
and
it
sure
works
for
me
with
so
many
coffee
ales
not
getting
it
right
this
is
quite
notable
yep
surly
coffee
bender
4
55
overall
nice
beer
id
like
the
flavor
to
have
a
bit
more
complexity
to
it
and
the
body
would
be
better
if
it
was
a
bit
thicker
worth
trying
if
youre
a
coffee
lover
pours
nice
dark
brown
with
a
small
white
head
smell
is
coffee
and
coffee
hints
of
hazelnuts
and
vanilla
taste
is
like
the
nose
coffee
very
nice
coffee
flavor
that
doesnt
taste
artificial
medium
body
with
lower
carbonation
that
works
well
with
this
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
flavors
work
great
together
a
must
try
for
coffee
lovers
o
a
classic
example
of
a
well
executed
brown
ale
and
the
coffee
only
makes
it
that
much
better
nice
job
surly
one
of
surlys
best
beers
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
coffee
drinkers
choice
in
beer
its
wonderful
mix
of
coffee
and
ale
give
it
a
very
distinguished
taste
ive
affectionately
named
this
beer
the
minnesota
paper
maker
because
id
often
find
myself
sipping
on
one
while
writing
long
winded
political
science
essays
the
caffeine
gets
your
mind
going
while
the
smooth
5
1
gets
you
loosened
up
just
enough
to
ramble
but
not
enough
to
get
you
surly
clear
brown
pour
with
a
ruby
hue
and
a
one
finger
off
white
head
aroma
is
100
dark
iced
coffee
taste
is
exactly
as
billed
brown
ale
and
coffee
in
the
background
are
aromatic
hops
and
a
touch
of
smoke
bitter
cold
coffee
flavor
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
its
bitter
but
not
astringent
i
would
have
liked
a
touch
more
sweetness
and
mouthfeel
but
that
may
just
be
personal
preference
very
enjoyable
and
very
flavorful
clearly
proves
that
you
dont
need
an
alcohol
bomb
to
have
big
bold
flavors
a
must
for
anyone
who
loves
both
coffee
and
beer
o
a
full
flavored
fresh
smelling
coffee
brown
ale
kept
at
a
nice
abv
to
keep
it
very
drinkable
i
would
gladly
take
this
over
many
of
the
doubleimperialris
coffee
stouts
ive
had
wow
never
had
a
beer
that
had
this
much
coffee
flavor
before
it
is
delicious
i
drink
my
coffee
black
so
this
beer
floats
my
boat
if
you
do
not
like
coffee
steer
clear
of
this
beer
it
is
not
like
fbs
where
you
could
like
the
beer
and
not
coffee
if
you
do
not
like
coffee
i
can
garuntee
you
will
hate
this
beer
with
a
passion
o
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
great
unfortunately
the
flavors
werent
as
complex
i
like
my
coffee
beers
to
be
chocked
full
of
complexities
like
fbs
however
if
you
are
a
coffee
drinker
its
worth
a
try
because
thats
exactly
what
it
tastes
like
i
actually
prefer
regular
bender
a
bit
more
with
it
focusing
more
on
traditional
brown
ale
flavors
o
coffee
coffee
and
more
coffee
sweet
and
intense
without
being
acrid
this
is
the
perfect
accompaniment
to
a
late
brunch
taste
integrates
the
deliciousness
of
the
bender
with
a
strong
coffee
flavor
but
the
coffee
never
seems
bitter
or
overthetop
well
done
indeed
it
is
definitely
a
little
onedimensional
compared
to
bender
but
still
delicious
this
might
just
be
up
there
with
fbs
as
one
of
the
best
breakfast
beers
ever
personally
i
like
the
bender
better
but
i
can
see
where
serious
coffee
lovers
would
find
this
more
to
their
liking
overall
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
had
a
beer
that
has
this
much
coffee
flavor
if
i
tasted
this
blindly
without
knowing
i
was
drinking
a
beer
i
would
not
recognize
it
as
such
i
would
classify
this
as
a
specialty
beer
for
coffee
lovers
maybe
i
will
swap
out
my
morning
coffee
for
this
on
weekday
mornings
working
for
the
man
overall
aroma
nails
it
flavor
doesnt
quite
live
up
tasty
but
not
in
my
top
coffeeflavored
beers
o
it
is
what
it
is
carbonated
black
coffee
with
a
splash
of
beer
its
so
simple
yet
so
unbelievably
satisfying
those
looking
for
a
more
balanced
approach
to
a
coffee
beer
would
be
better
served
by
fbs
or
wakenbake
though
despite
the
wonderful
aroma
and
flavor
this
beer
i
guess
could
benefit
from
being
slightly
bigger
not
like
victory
at
sea
but
in
the
middle
i
could
imagine
this
beer
blowing
my
mind
with
some
bigger
malt
backbone
so
in
that
sense
its
disappointing
slightly
but
at
5
1
abv
i
couldnt
imagine
a
beer
really
doing
coffee
in
a
brown
ale
better
for
its
abv
o
finally
a
coffee
beer
that
actually
tastes
and
smells
like
black
iced
coffee
with
no
frills
or
extra
flavors
very
drinkable
to
boot
not
my
favorite
coffee
beer
thus
far
since
i
like
my
coffee
with
cream
and
sugar
but
man
do
they
nail
that
unadulterated
coffee
flavor
this
beer
has
my
approval
too
i
am
sure
sheryl
likes
this
she
better
man
this
is
good
if
you
like
beer
grab
a
can
if
you
like
coffee
grab
a
can
if
you
like
beer
and
coffee
grab
a
case
its
worth
it
to
the
last
drop
cheers
coffee
craft
beer
drinkers
yummy
o
a
wonderful
beer
that
manages
to
blend
coffee
and
beer
together
in
a
delicious
way
if
youre
a
coffee
drinker
specifically
espresso
drinker
this
beer
will
leave
you
very
happy
highly
recommended
cheers
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
leading
to
a
mouthfeel
of
light
foam
and
general
smoothness
closes
with
medium
dryness
and
astringency
from
coffee
with
little
residual
stickiness
my
tastebuds
hated
my
sense
of
smell
my
nose
was
the
one
that
got
the
most
delicious
coffee
out
of
this
beer
despite
that
this
was
still
a
pretty
good
coffee
brown
ale
id
drink
it
again
if
given
the
opportunity
again
i
know
my
nose
would
love
it
if
i
got
another
can
4
got
some
fresh
cans
of
this
beast
i
cracked
one
in
vegas
in
the
morning
in
my
room
because
there
was
no
coffee
maker
present
damn
this
stuff
is
good
just
like
drinking
straight
up
black
coffee
thin
mouthfeel
which
makes
it
seem
more
like
an
iced
coffee
drink
than
a
beer
which
is
kinda
cool
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
o
4
5
another
great
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
coffee
and
beer
that
settles
into
a
really
complex
aroma
and
flavor
profile
thats
as
smooth
as
some
of
the
best
iced
coffees
i
find
this
beer
really
refreshing
and
i
cannot
think
of
another
coffee
beer
that
fits
this
profile
well
done
as
always
surly
rarely
would
i
reach
for
a
coffee
beer
in
the
warm
summer
heat
but
this
is
oddly
refreshing
so
damn
drinkable
its
silly
perfect
in
warm
or
cold
weather
a
nice
blend
of
coffee
and
a
solid
base
beer
coffee
definitely
shines
but
bender
isnt
lost
in
the
mix
overall
enjoyable
sessionable
and
very
flavourful
thats
the
story
of
the
surly
bender
beers
it
goes
down
easily
is
refreshing
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
i
like
the
bender
better
since
thats
a
beer
where
the
actual
hops
and
malt
are
showcased
while
this
one
is
dominated
by
the
coffee
but
i
dont
mind
today
when
its
86
degrees
outside
in
wisconsin
and
i
want
something
refreshing
this
happens
to
satisfy
that
quota
4
coffee
bender
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
lacing
white
head
the
aroma
is
similar
to
that
of
a
cup
of
coffee
the
taste
has
a
very
strong
profound
coffee
flavor
very
rich
strong
flavor
as
easy
to
drink
as
a
cup
of
coffee
overall
a
very
strong
coffee
beer
o
one
of
my
favorite
coffee
beers
i
dont
really
care
too
much
for
the
regular
bender
but
this
is
a
whole
different
beer
it
smells
like
a
french
press
and
tastes
like
an
iced
coffee
overall
this
might
be
the
ultimate
coffee
beer
if
you
do
not
really
enjoy
a
well
made
cup
of
coffee
then
i
would
strongly
encourage
you
to
not
buy
this
beer
if
you
do
get
it
now
in
the
big
picture
this
almost
doesnt
feel
like
a
beer
so
much
as
it
does
a
mixed
coffee
drink
which
is
why
the
score
while
high
might
not
match
up
to
the
amount
of
gushing
im
doing
here
still
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
experience
which
i
greatly
enjoyed
if
i
could
get
this
locally
i
would
get
it
quite
often
o
this
is
quite
a
beer
i
love
coffee
beers
though
i
have
only
had
coffee
infused
imperial
stouts
up
to
this
point
which
i
prefer
because
there
are
other
elements
balancing
and
enriching
the
coffee
flavor
this
is
just
straight
coffee
would
be
great
in
the
morning
final
thoughts
i
really
feel
this
beer
is
served
well
by
focusing
itself
as
a
brown
and
not
a
porter
or
stout
like
most
coffee
beers
and
i
think
the
slightly
milder
roasting
might
have
something
to
do
with
it
its
just
an
all
around
well
done
beer
but
if
you
dont
like
coffee
youll
want
to
pass
o
the
perfect
before
noon
beer
for
me
and
my
taste
buds
i
try
to
go
to
the
blue
door
pub
every
sunday
to
get
my
fix
after
my
morning
cup
of
coffee
and
the
gym
i
really
appreciate
that
i
can
drink
more
than
one
of
this
beer
as
opposed
to
most
coffee
stouts
this
is
a
brown
ale
and
isnt
as
thick
and
filling
i
may
be
biased
but
i
love
surly
cheers
o
there
is
only
one
coffee
beer
that
tops
this
but
it
is
only
brewed
every
4
years
or
so
if
you
like
beer
and
coffee
this
is
a
big
coffee
beer
that
you
should
try
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
might
as
well
be
black
the
head
was
tan
and
creamy
looking
there
is
a
thin
scattered
lacing
on
the
glass
with
a
pretty
good
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
great
coffee
aroma
with
a
subtle
malt
sweetness
in
there
too
the
taste
follows
the
nose
a
very
nice
coffee
flavor
from
start
to
finish
on
this
beer
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
as
hell
and
has
a
soft
carbonation
to
it
overall
its
a
great
beer
no
surprise
there
because
its
from
surly
this
is
a
killer
brew
well
worth
trying
o
this
works
out
to
be
one
of
those
beers
that
im
technically
impressed
with
but
dont
particularly
enjoy
theyve
packed
an
intense
amount
of
coffee
flavor
into
this
beer
but
it
seems
to
have
lost
any
subtlety
or
balance
it
might
have
had
ultimately
im
not
sure
how
different
this
is
from
taking
a
cup
of
cold
brew
and
adding
a
shot
of
vodka
to
it
o
this
is
a
delicious
relatively
low
abv
beer
the
coffee
aging
adds
a
pronounced
flavor
probably
closer
to
the
actual
flavors
in
coffee
than
most
any
other
beer
i
have
had
there
are
a
few
out
of
place
nuances
to
this
beer
almost
a
staleness
but
i
would
imagine
this
one
is
best
consumed
fresh
my
first
surly
beer
and
i
am
pretty
impressed
drink
this
if
you
can
get
it
drinkability
good
stuff
but
can
i
get
some
beer
with
my
coffee
i
love
coffee
infused
beer
but
this
is
more
coffee
than
beer
i
would
have
liked
more
complexity
o
for
a
light
coffee
beer
i
have
had
no
better
surly
really
hit
the
coffee
character
on
the
head
with
this
brew
the
huge
coffee
aromanotes
really
make
you
wonder
how
much
coffee
they
added
to
this
brew
but
as
long
as
it
tastes
good
and
maintains
its
beer
characteristicabv
i
have
no
problem
with
that
i
really
likes
the
fact
that
the
hops
really
shine
on
the
finish
this
is
a
unique
and
drinkable
brew
that
really
works
could
this
be
pulled
off
by
another
brewery
probably
not
try
it
edit
just
wanted
to
add
that
this
beer
is
10x
better
than
founders
frangelic
mountain
final
thoughts
i
tend
to
like
real
coffee
and
hazelnut
flavors
in
beer
so
i
like
coffee
bender
however
i
dont
see
why
its
a
yearround
offering
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
but
i
wouldnt
take
it
over
the
regular
bender
o
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
especially
with
the
coffee
addition
lending
some
complexity
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
i
wish
it
were
a
big
stronger
abv
and
tastewise
to
give
it
some
real
heft
it
would
probably
be
4
5s
across
the
board
at
that
point
dont
let
me
take
anything
away
from
it
its
still
great
topnotch
drinkability
overall
if
i
could
drink
this
every
day
i
would
this
would
be
one
of
the
beers
id
like
to
keep
on
hand
at
all
times
if
i
could
id
rate
this
very
close
to
founders
breakfast
stout
maybe
slightly
higher
i
love
it
so
much
depth
to
this
i
cant
get
enough
damn
it
i
need
a
surly
local
now
fml
a
coffee
or
a
coffee
bender
in
the
morning
me
being
not
a
big
coffee
drinker
id
take
the
latter
9
out
of
10
times
this
would
actually
make
for
a
legitimate
alternative
to
a
coffee
any
time
of
the
day
this
is
hands
down
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
at
5
1
abv
this
packs
a
punch
in
every
category
the
only
question
im
left
with
is
why
did
i
only
order
a
4
pack
of
this
i
like
regular
bender
way
better
than
this
the
coffee
just
doesnt
work
for
me
it
overpowers
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
the
coffee
could
be
smoother
and
richer
i
know
lots
of
people
really
like
this
beer
but
for
me
its
decent
but
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
bender
plus
coffee
could
be
amazing
but
this
just
isnt
perhaps
my
least
favorite
surly
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
reddish
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
medium
lighttan
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
quite
malty
with
a
hint
of
coffee
as
the
beer
warms
the
coffee
makes
itself
more
know
roasted
coffee
with
some
nuttiness
as
well
taste
is
just
as
it
smells
starts
off
with
a
nutty
maltiness
then
fades
to
roasted
coffee
beans
dark
malt
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
coffee
beer
very
userfriendly
to
those
who
dont
feel
comfortable
jumping
into
a
coffee
porter
or
coffee
stout
quality
beer
surly
compares
to
a
starbucks
iced
coffee
in
a
can
almost
like
one
of
the
starbucks
energy
drinks
a
very
strong
potent
smell
of
coffee
and
beans
but
a
very
weak
beer
its
almost
like
a
light
beer
with
color
additive
overall
i
would
drink
it
again
bc
i
am
a
coffee
fan
but
i
truly
believe
the
coffee
added
makes
it
like
left
over
coffee
from
the
pot
in
the
afternoon
overall
a
much
better
beer
than
fmb
and
perplexing
at
the
same
time
truly
very
much
enjoyed
but
wish
it
was
more
substantial
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
direction
breakfast
stout
should
go
in
flavor
but
what
fbs
makes
up
for
in
body
t
lots
of
coffee
and
a
touch
of
toasted
hazelnut
upfront
some
roasted
malt
in
the
middle
followed
by
some
faint
raisin
skin
a
touch
of
acidity
and
just
a
hint
of
caramel
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
but
i
like
how
the
coffee
works
in
this
o
a
pretty
decent
brown
ale
but
overall
im
not
sure
it
deserves
the
high
rating
it
holds
here
on
ba
perhaps
i
need
to
spend
a
little
more
time
with
this
one
but
i
am
not
in
love
with
it
o
well
done
i
want
another
and
will
buy
again
i
like
it
better
than
regular
bender
not
quite
breakfast
stout
so
im
glad
i
live
in
mi
i
guess
but
thats
comparing
apples
and
oranges
drinkable
and
full
flavored
sort
of
a
session
overall
a
really
nice
and
easy
drinking
coffee
beer
when
i
think
coffee
im
used
to
it
being
in
a
pretty
big
beer
not
the
case
here
and
it
works
great
o
very
enjoyable
great
beer
for
a
wet
coast
fall
day
o
very
good
brown
ale
coffee
works
very
well
with
base
brown
bender
not
overpowering
coffe
just
enough
o
bottom
line
there
is
no
way
i
wont
load
up
on
these
whenever
im
in
minny
for
work
i
love
how
natural
this
tastes
compared
to
many
of
the
artificially
tasting
coffee
brews
ive
had
before
this
is
just
as
advertised
and
i
enjoyed
it
o
different
from
any
other
coffee
ale
ive
had
maybe
its
from
surlys
cold
extraction
process
of
the
coffee
it
just
has
a
naturalorganic
coffee
flavor
not
artificial
or
synthetic
i
would
definately
purchase
more
of
these
if
they
were
sold
in
vegas
either
way
cheers
overall
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
coffeedominated
beers
but
the
coffee
in
here
is
dominant
without
being
too
acidic
it
makes
for
a
very
pleasant
coffee
experience
o
this
was
a
very
flavorful
beer
that
had
a
very
nice
coffee
taste
to
it
if
you
like
coffee
beers
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
the
aroma
was
very
nice
and
the
taste
was
very
good
but
the
finish
was
slightly
too
bitter
very
easy
to
drink
tasty
would
love
to
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
great
beer
glad
surly
made
this
a
brown
instead
of
a
coffee
stout
o
overall
this
was
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
the
coffee
really
jumps
with
this
one
in
the
nose
and
taste
only
complaint
would
be
the
coffee
overpowers
the
brown
ale
aspects
of
the
beer
o
a
pretty
nice
coffee
beer
very
tasty
and
drinkable
if
i
was
a
coffee
drinker
this
would
be
my
beer
of
choice
or
at
least
one
of
the
finalists
surly
seems
to
be
doing
some
pretty
good
things
up
there
in
minnesota
cant
wait
to
get
back
and
watch
the
twins
or
vikings
choke
while
i
drink
some
good
beers
from
surly
summit
and
a
host
of
other
pretty
good
breweries
in
the
area
o
as
an
avid
coffee
drinker
and
lover
of
coffee
coffee
flavored
things
also
guatemalan
coffee
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
find
this
beer
to
be
extremely
enjoyable
the
combination
of
great
flavors
along
with
the
lighter
body
make
this
beer
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
definitely
sessionable
and
one
that
i
would
thoroughly
enjoy
drinking
many
of
in
a
session
not
sure
if
there
is
any
caffeine
in
this
beer
but
it
almost
seems
to
give
a
little
buzz
overall
an
excellent
coffee
beer
dont
drink
it
if
you
dont
like
coffee
overall
a
well
designed
and
executed
homage
to
coffee
with
a
pleasant
kick
of
5
alcohol
o
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
new
favorite
coffee
beers
i
think
the
brown
ale
pairs
well
with
the
coffee
its
a
welcome
change
from
the
more
traditional
stoutcoffee
pairing
o
this
is
the
second
beer
i
have
had
from
surly
and
i
have
definitely
been
impressed
they
did
an
excellent
job
balancing
the
flavors
and
it
tastes
damn
well
close
to
an
iced
coffee
i
need
to
try
their
brown
ale
now
to
see
what
the
base
beer
tastes
like
before
they
added
the
coffee
a
great
buy
feels
like
a
malty
cup
of
coffee
honestly
i
like
it
the
only
thing
you
can
compare
it
to
is
maybe
cubano
espresso
brown
from
cigar
city
matter
of
fact
theyre
pretty
close
and
both
tasty
as
hell
o
i
actually
prefer
coffee
beers
over
actual
coffee
if
its
possible
for
coffee
to
be
understated
it
is
here
there
is
just
enough
to
really
enjoy
but
not
too
much
to
overpower
the
exceptional
quality
brown
ale
if
you
like
this
style
porters
andor
coffee
seek
this
out
maybe
not
earthshattering
but
a
damn
drinkable
beer
wish
it
was
easiercheaper
to
find
good
beer
d
cool
to
have
a
brown
coffee
flavored
brew
certainly
drinkable
more
of
an
early
day
beer
imo
like
i
said
above
could
be
hit
with
even
more
coffee
to
be
the
biggest
flavoraroma
factor
right
now
that
and
chocolate
are
pretty
much
even
this
brew
was
incredibly
drinkable
and
didnt
sit
too
heavy
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
coffee
in
general
but
i
do
dig
on
some
coffee
beers
coffee
bender
had
enough
coffee
to
keep
things
interesting
but
it
wasnt
overbearing
kind
of
weird
and
kind
of
a
disappointment
i
love
surly
and
i
love
coffee
beers
but
this
one
isnt
for
me
a
little
one
note
and
kind
of
tastes
like
cheap
coffee
as
opposed
to
something
gourmet
ill
stick
to
the
regular
bender
oa
must
have
for
coffee
lovers
a
tad
too
much
coffee
for
me
still
a
wonderful
beer
this
makes
for
a
great
ad
tired
of
boring
american
brown
ales
try
surly
coffee
bender
youll
love
it
will
i
you
betcha
o
well
blended
and
balanced
very
nicely
done
one
of
the
better
coffee
beers
ive
sampled
very
aromatic
and
well
balanced
with
an
unexpected
delicacy
as
well
well
worth
hunting
down
d
brewers
did
a
really
good
job
of
combining
coffee
and
brown
ale
perfect
blend
not
too
much
coffee
and
not
too
much
mild
brown
ale
malt
taste
good
stuff
overall
i
am
kind
of
glad
i
didnt
love
this
since
i
shouldnt
get
it
in
the
first
place
could
have
been
the
sculpin
or
120
heightening
my
hops
preception
but
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
overall
o
its
like
a
lighter
version
of
founders
breakfast
stout
its
pretty
one
dimensional
but
works
really
well
as
a
coffee
infused
brown
ale
i
wish
i
had
another
so
that
i
could
have
drank
it
out
of
a
mug
alongside
some
bacon
and
eggs
its
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
its
predictable
in
being
a
brown
ale
with
coffee
yet
its
put
together
with
perfect
harmony
o
definitely
a
good
beer
and
one
you
can
start
your
morning
with
o
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
the
cold
steeped
ground
coffee
works
to
great
effect
the
coffee
flavors
are
not
overpowering
creating
a
brew
thats
really
smooth
from
start
to
finish
terrific
beer
by
surly
the
coffee
really
comes
through
enhancing
an
under
appreciated
style
the
balance
is
held
throughout
as
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
delivers
just
as
the
caramel
and
chocolate
tone
become
too
sweet
would
be
happy
to
crack
another
one
soon
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
has
tons
of
coffee
flavor
but
it
is
thinner
than
most
coffee
flavored
beers
i
like
the
taste
except
for
the
finish
it
is
bitter
and
that
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
overly
impressed
i
prefer
the
coffee
stouts
and
porters
o
a
very
delicious
year
round
coffee
beer
from
surly
it
is
a
nice
balanced
beer
that
brings
a
good
balanced
coffee
flavor
i
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
of
normal
bender
however
im
a
big
fan
of
this
and
will
try
to
seek
anymore
i
could
see
this
as
a
good
beer
to
have
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
dont
think
id
have
it
as
much
with
dessert
as
it
might
be
a
bit
light
to
stand
up
to
some
of
those
richer
flavors
o
a
delicious
coffee
beer
like
rich
strong
iced
coffee
pours
a
pure
brown
with
an
average
size
beige
head
aroma
is
sweet
nutty
and
coffee
filled
the
taste
is
much
more
coffee
oriented
than
anything
else
its
got
a
coffee
and
cream
type
of
thing
with
some
cocoa
and
roastiness
i
guess
the
iced
coffee
cited
in
the
description
is
pretty
accurate
i
would
like
to
try
the
regular
bender
so
i
can
taste
more
of
what
the
coffee
aspect
did
to
this
brew
great
for
coffee
lovers
the
four
loko
of
craft
brews
no
just
a
great
brown
ale
with
coffee
caffeine
added
body
is
mediumthin
and
carbonation
is
lively
crisp
and
dry
refreshing
not
overthetop
in
terms
of
flavor
or
aroma
just
a
wellmade
very
drinkable
brown
ale
with
a
decent
coffee
hit
o
very
drinkable
coffee
infused
brown
ale
i
like
how
the
can
states
your
only
dilemma
will
be
whether
to
finish
your
day
or
start
it
with
a
coffee
bender
overall
i
really
like
this
as
a
coffee
beer
the
aroma
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
taste
in
fact
the
aroma
is
a
little
lacking
when
compared
to
the
taste
but
the
taste
definitely
makes
up
for
that
this
is
one
that
i
could
and
actually
did
have
in
the
morning
on
one
of
my
days
off
awesome
its
never
too
early
to
get
surly
must
try
if
you
like
coffee
beers
big
thanks
to
timmyj21
for
this
in
our
recent
trade
youre
awesome
tim
overall
probably
the
best
brown
ive
ever
had
drinkability
is
superb
flavors
are
outstanding
definitely
a
winner
from
surly
and
i
would
drink
this
daily
if
i
could
i
also
think
it
would
make
one
hell
of
a
beer
bread
o
pretty
nice
coffee
beer
not
my
favorite
but
up
there
wish
there
was
other
flavors
to
compliment
the
coffee
just
too
much
like
a
cold
cup
of
coffee
to
be
my
favorite
o
this
is
more
like
drinking
a
cup
of
coffee
than
a
beer
dont
put
this
down
too
late
at
night
or
you
wont
be
doing
much
sleeping
i
do
wish
there
was
a
little
something
else
the
coffee
wore
on
me
after
a
while
o
although
lacking
in
aroma
this
might
be
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
very
flavorful
o
surly
has
created
one
of
the
best
brews
i
have
ever
experienced
the
iced
coffee
attributes
that
are
cloaked
as
a
brown
ale
is
unyielding
coffee
bender
is
a
brew
that
i
will
always
want
and
enjoy
what
a
brewery
what
a
beer
how
i
wish
how
i
wish
they
were
here
id
be
one
lost
soul
swimming
in
a
bowl
of
coffee
bender
year
after
year
o
nice
beer
overall
expected
a
bit
more
with
bender
as
a
base
very
unique
brown
ale
highly
recommended
another
nice
surly
brew
overall
this
is
my
favorite
coffee
flavor
brews
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
coffee
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
twofinger
light
brown
head
mild
lacing
and
retention
dark
roast
coffee
aroma
hints
of
sweet
cream
and
vanilla
flavor
profile
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
nice
sweet
and
creamy
vanilla
notes
bit
of
nuttiness
with
maybe
a
touch
of
hazelnut
dark
semi
bitter
coffee
beans
and
a
touch
of
hops
balance
this
one
out
nicely
to
close
everything
that
is
right
with
a
sessionable
coffee
beer
really
nice
way
to
vamp
up
this
style
and
one
of
the
better
browns
out
there
doverall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
if
you
like
coffee
beers
you
will
like
this
one
for
sure
i
was
happy
to
catch
a
little
hops
in
there
as
it
made
it
memorable
this
is
something
i
would
stock
up
on
if
i
was
in
mn
for
sure
id
love
to
get
this
one
again
def
pick
some
up
if
you
can
overall
great
coffee
brew
nice
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
really
good
as
much
coffee
beers
are
highly
reccomended
to
coffee
drinkers
cheers
o
this
is
just
a
wonderful
beer
for
coffee
lovers
as
well
as
anyone
who
appreciates
a
very
well
done
infused
beer
coffee
haters
need
not
apply
everyone
else
you
gotta
try
this
one
o
this
is
a
very
nice
coffee
with
a
beer
feeling
does
that
make
sense
this
is
a
nice
maltycoffee
beer
that
is
still
heavy
on
the
beer
character
which
i
like
a
lot
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
satisfying
this
is
really
damn
good
im
a
fan
of
fresh
tasting
coffee
beans
no
stale
ones
please
and
this
delivers
i
love
that
its
a
low
abv
beer
and
that
this
is
a
brown
ale
base
considering
its
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
coffee
bender
is
seriously
making
me
rethink
that
overall
a
good
try
and
a
well
made
beer
but
underwhelming
dark
dark
brown
with
mahogany
highlights
almosttan
head
that
had
pretty
good
retention
and
left
a
little
lace
nose
is
coffee
intertwined
with
toasty
roasty
malty
malt
and
a
kind
of
chocolatecoffee
malted
milkshake
scent
taste
follows
suit
with
a
nice
chocolatecocoa
character
that
is
sweet
but
doesnt
translate
as
anywhere
near
cloying
or
out
of
step
great
harmony
here
also
a
pretty
healthy
hop
character
that
blends
right
in
hops
create
a
bitter
sensation
as
well
that
melds
with
the
bitter
of
the
coffee
perfectly
the
malted
milkshake
thing
comes
through
in
the
middle
very
nicely
medium
body
that
is
soft
and
borders
on
slick
mild
carbonation
abv
is
undetectable
to
me
overall
a
great
twist
on
an
already
very
very
good
beer
quite
a
pleasure
o
a
very
good
beer
well
balanced
thickness
and
chewiness
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
and
compliment
each
other
well
the
coffee
is
not
excessively
dominate
a
great
anytime
beer
i
might
have
one
with
breakfast
what
a
great
coffee
beer
as
the
name
implies
you
expect
coffee
and
thats
what
you
get
lots
of
it
the
most
coffee
coffee
beer
ive
tasted
has
the
coffee
roast
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
its
balanced
well
by
some
mild
sweetness
could
drink
this
with
breakfast
mouthfeel
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
decent
carbonation
level
and
very
smooth
lighter
bodied
than
you
would
expect
especially
since
it
has
such
a
big
coffee
flavor
to
it
bitter
finish
on
the
end
very
good
beer
a
must
for
any
coffee
lover
or
coffee
brown
ale
fan
ive
criticized
some
coffee
beers
in
the
past
for
being
more
like
coffee
than
beer
and
i
must
admit
that
coffee
bender
is
very
close
to
that
line
yet
somehow
i
love
this
beer
i
think
a
major
reason
is
that
i
really
love
the
coffee
that
they
used
a
delicious
way
to
start
my
beer
drinking
morning
cost

99
for
a
four
pack
of
16
oz

little
room
for
improvement
in
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
good
carbonation
level
and
very
smooth
lighter
bodied
than
one
would
expect
especially
since
it
has
such
a
big
coffee
flavor
to
it
nice
bitter

well
very
good

16
ounce
can
canned
on
date
of

served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
an
inch
tan
head
both
the
head
retention
and
lacing
are
good
aroma
is
coffee
roasted
malt
bittersweet
chocolate
and
some
nuts
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
theres
also
a
bit
of
vanilla
noticeable
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
slick
and
is
well
carbonated
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
overall
brew
i
liked
it
a
lot
its
heavy
on
the
coffee
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
and
thats
a
good
thing
for
me
its
certainly
worth
trying
i
know
id
like
to
get
more
of
this
brew
in
the
future
you
could
probably
get
away
with
justifying
drinking
this
with
breakfast
its
so
coffeeforward
i
love
this
beer
this
may
be
my
favorite
out
of
the
surly
beers
maybe
even
my
favorite
coffee
beer
pours
with
a
billowing
tan
khaki
head
and
forms
fine
even
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
their
infusion
process
really
makes
the
beer
body
is
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
aroma
has
dark
nutty
notes
of
coffee
with
hints
of
cream
and
sugar
really
its
like
the
best
iced
coffee
youve
ever
had
with
a
strong
earthy
coffee
nose
flavor
is
excellent
the
most
intense
and
flavorful
coffee
beer
ive
ever
tasted
this
beer
tastes
great
creamed
coffee
chocolate
dense
creamy
vanilla
highlights
within
a
dark
brown
ale
just
tastes
great
mouthfeel
is
creamy
textured
and
im
burping
up
coffee
beans
this
is
an
intense
beer
experience
mouthfeel
is
slightly
acidic
with
coffee
bean
notes
and
goes
down
easy
loving
every
second
of
it
drinkability
is
creamy
texture
is
awesome
and
the
beer
that
ive
dreamt
of
when
it
comes
to
coffee
beers
thanks
again
ryan
aka
schlais
if
you
need
anymore
white
rajah
let
me
know
big
thanks
to
stu
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
beer
this
is
a
pretty
awesome
coffee
beer
definitely
the
best
coffee
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
aroma
smells
like
iced
coffee
with
small
hints
of
chocolate
the
beer
starts
with
a
nice
coffee
burst
and
bitterness
at
the
front
of
the
mouth
followed
by
some
sweet
milk
chocolate
notes
and
more
coffee
at
the
middle
of
the
mouth
the
finish
is
very
smooth
with
a
big
coffee
like
aftertaste
very
drinkable
also
id
rather
have
this
beer
than
my
morning
coffee
every
day
dr
not
really
drinkable
more
of
a
tame
sipper
which
is
inexcusable
at
this
low
an
abv
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
but
its
okay
for
the
style
coffee
beer
fanatics
might
be
the
only
ones
that
will
truly
like
this
give
me
a
black
damnation
ii
mocha
bomb
any
day
of
the
week
but
leave
this
one
be
enjoyed
it
a
bit
more
than
regular
bender
but
still
dont
find
anything
about
it
that
stands
out
balanced
but
not
very
complex
id
like
to
try
it
again
but
wasnt
extremely
impressed
this
time
around
i
like
what
the
coffee
does
with
this
but
i
dont
like
how
it
erases
the
caramel
and
nut
influence
of
standard
bender
decent
well
worth
seeking
out
and
drinking
regularly
but
not
as
good
as
the
base
beer
have
been
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
aroma
smacks
me
in
the
face
with
coffee
it
smells
like
iced
coffee
and
coco
powder
it
is
everything
i
could
hope
for
and
more
from
a
coffee
heavy
beer
flavor
is
a
bit
too
much
like
a
cold
cup
of
coffee
it
is
very
nice
with
of
course
tons
of
coffee
a
bit
of
mocha
very
nice
but
a
bit
too
much
coffee
for
me
here
mouthfeel
could
have
been
a
bit
fuller
a
bit
creamier
mild
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
but
i
am
a
bit
confused
by
it
seems
much
more
coffee
than
beer
but
if
that
is
what
you
are
looking
for
there
is
nothing
better
o
someone
below
me
said
it
best
i
fucking
love
this
beer
very
sessionable
this
is
a
brew
i
could
easily
enjoy
on
a
daily
basis
all
winter
long
surly
truly
did
a
stellar
job
with
this
one
and
i
pray
they
duplicate
it
well
next
year
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
was
a
nice
jolt
of
fresh
coffee
to
the
base
beer
which
made
for
a
nice
enjoyable
treat
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
a
single
fingered
head
formed
atop
this
brownish
red
beer
displaying
good
retention
and
some
lacing
roasted
coffee
notes
dominate
the
smell
taste
follows
the
smell
literally
tastes
like
fresh
coffee
beans
relatively
light
mouthfeel
from
this
dry
brown
ale
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
enjoyable
still
amazes
me
how
potent
the
coffee
flavors
were
i
would
recommend
to
friends
and
will
definitely
drink
again
in
the
future
o
this
was
really
good
very
inviting
and
warming
5
alcohol
and
45
ibus
really
nice
balance
in
flavor
and
quite
sessionable
for
me
so
much
different
and
more
pleasant
for
me
than
bender
coffee
bender
though
delivers
on
that
promise
from
wire
to
wire
from
the
first
rich
coffee
scented
whiff
to
the
ultra
smooth
rich
coffee
taste
that
is
the
closet
actual
beer
ive
had
to
drinking
coffee
it
is
quite
incredible
what
they
managed
to
pull
off
with
this
one
o
this
is
basically
the
regular
bender
with
a
nice
coffee
kick
i
dug
it
overall
easy
drinking
beer
with
good
coffee
flavor
and
sufficient
maltiness
being
both
a
coffee
and
beer
lover
i
like
all
the
flavors
but
always
feel
a
nagging
do
they
need
to
be
together
feeling
about
coffee
beers
in
this
case
it
works
very
well
because
the
rich
distinctive
coffee
really
does
play
off
the
base
beer
o
this
is
almost
exactly
like
drinking
an
iced
coffee
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
tasty
nontheless
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
drinkability
feels
at
first
thin
not
in
a
bad
way
just
not
heavy
and
filling
like
some
beers
the
beer
is
refreshing
because
of
how
well
balanced
it
is
the
coffeeroasted
taste
lingers
and
is
quite
pleasant
the
complexity
deepens
as
the
beer
warms
and
more
caramel
tones
come
through
so
yeah
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
superb
coffee
notes
but
not
overly
coffee
flavored
or
too
bitter
a
session
coffee
beer
so
to
speak
overall
too
thin
and
too
much
coffee
ive
had
this
in
both
a
can
and
on
draft
and
didnt
enjoy
it
either
time
canned
25sep11
a
dark
brown
with
a
transient
finger
or
so
of
off
tan
foam
which
falls
quickly
to
a
scattered
surface
excellent
clarity
and
spotty
lace
2
5
s
smells
like
breakfast
coffee
plain
and
black
with
the
slightest
hint
of
burnt
nuts
maybe
a
little
bit
of
a
cinnamon
tone
3
t
coffee
is
present
but
seems
stale
the
beer
itself
seems
a
bit
stale
with
a
bit
of
soil
and
bitterness
again
a
hint
of
nuts
2
5
m
thin
with
moderate
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
sadly
this
so
far
has
been
the
best
part
3
5
o
not
impressed
with
this
offering
like
the
regular
version
much
better
2

thanks
to
woosterbill
for
the
cans
very
nice
a
bit
of
an
acrid
kind
of
sharp
hoppiness
but
i
liked
it
it
didnt
have
as
much
of
a
coffee
smell
that
i
was
expecting
a
rich
dark
color
and
a
cleaner
yet
rich
taste
a
friend
brought
some
down
from
mn
and
was
a
nice
part
of
the
celebration
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
proper
overall
bender
with
iced
coffee
is
exactly
right
and
the
only
way
to
market
this
beer
what
really
makes
it
great
is
that
the
coffee
never
completely
dominates
it
leaves
just
enough
room
for
the
creamer
hop
and
sweet
malt
character
a
really
fun
and
delicious
beer
o
an
amazingly
fantastic
beer
i
couldnt
write
this
damn
review
quick
enough
to
get
back
to
drinking
it
surly
can
do
no
wrong
i
have
one
more
offering
from
them
a
year
old
smoke
that
im
going
to
have
to
fight
hard
not
to
drink
tonight
surly
kicks
ass
o
probably
the
most
coffee
forward
beer
i
have
had
i
really
like
this
and
found
it
better
than
regular
bender
very
happy
that
i
have
more
cans
definitely
will
seek
out
again
o
one
of
my
least
favorite
surly
beers
i
get
what
they
are
doing
just
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
complexity
if
you
are
looking
for
an
iced
coffee
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
then
this
might
be
the
beer
youve
been
looking
for
o
nice
stuff
coffee
dominates
the
taste
and
is
great
i
like
my
surly
also
dont
try
to
compare
this
to
a
stout
or
porter
because
its
just
not
youre
doing
yourself
a
disservice
with
those
expectations
o
tasty
but
not
overbearing
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
which
isnt
typical
of
a
coffee
beer
cheers
o
never
had
a
brew
that
can
rival
an
actual
cup
of
coffee
i
can
probably
put
this
in
a
coffee
mug
and
drink
it
all
day
at
work
great
brew
would
defintely
have
it
again
and
again
and
again
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
obviously
the
coffee
dominates
as
its
supposed
to
excellent
beer
for
coffee
lovers
but
not
overpowering
for
those
who
like
it
less
light
body
seems
to
be
at
odds
with
the
flavors
sometimes
id
enjoy
it
more
if
the
coffee
was
dialed
back
just
a
bit
to
let
the
brown
ale
characteristics
compliment
it
better
d
this
is
almost
like
drinking
an
iced
coffee
without
some
of
the
bitterness
that
iced
coffees
usually
have
really
fresh
coffee
dominates
everything
about
the
beer
recommended
if
you
like
coffee
otherwise
i
would
stay
away
from
this
one
poured
from
a
can
into
a
wine
glass
i
bought
the
four
pack
this
past
weekend
in
minneapolis
it
pours
a
hazelnut
brown
in
color
pretty
light
in
body
with
a
one
finger
beige
head
that
turns
to
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
very
fresh
coffee
grounds
with
light
chocolate
the
grounds
are
very
pungent
and
bitter
its
not
very
complex
and
is
on
the
verge
of
being
completely
one
dimensional
its
just
so
much
ground
yet
not
much
actual
coffee
the
flavor
too
is
in
your
face
coffee
grounds
with
some
slight
sweet
roasted
malt
and
a
light
bitter
finish
its
ok
and
easy
to
drink
but
its
just
ok
i
just
wish
it
had
more
complexity
it
drinks
light
and
you
can
tell
its
built
for
a
can
the
way
it
poured
and
due
to
how
light
it
is
overall
its
just
an
ok
brown
ale
without
much
complexity
id
say
this
is
the
first
beer
from
surly
im
not
overly
impressed
by
overall
a
good
coffee
beer
i
think
i
prefer
the
regular
bender
to
this
one
though
overall
i
do
love
this
beer
it
perfectly
combines
2
of
my
favorite
styles
brown
ales
and
coffee
stoutscoffee
ales
highly
recommended
just
wish
they
distributed
outside
of
mn
overall
i
love
this
beer
the
fact
its
a
brown
ale
lets
the
coffee
shine
unlike
some
heavy
handed
coffee
stouts
thanks
to
lostcook
for
bringing
this
back
for
me
i
missed
out
on
trying
this
when
i
was
in
mn
never
again
this
is
for
folks
who
like
some
beer
with
their
coffee
this
is
like
nothing
else
i
have
had
a
true
coffee
beer
outstanding
and
well
worth
the
price
and
shipping
o
a
good
coffee
beer
that
really
grew
on
me
i
really
like
how
the
good
brown
ale
characteristics
come
through
and
blend
with
the
coffee
nothing
seems
overpowering
with
this
brew
o
i
like
this
and
my
wife
likes
it
even
better
shed
probably
give
it
one
higher
grade
ive
not
had
a
bad
surly
beer
yet
good
stuff
o
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
bold
ale
that
shows
great
characteristics
of
the
style
alongside
some
nice
coffee
and
espresso
notes
next
time
ill
be
grabbing
a
6er
of
this
stuff
o
big
coffee
flavour
lives
up
to
the
suggestion
on
the
can
that
does
take
away
from
the
brown
ale
aspect
but
that
is
not
an
inconvenience
here
unless
youre
not
a
coffee
fan
o
this
is
the
first
time
trying
this
beer
offering
from
surly
and
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
did
not
disappoint
i
was
expecting
the
coffee
to
overpower
any
brown
ale
beer
taste
but
it
merely
enhanced
a
style
that
i
already
really
love
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
o
an
enjoyable
beer
my
brother
and
i
split
a
4
pack
on
the
night
i
reviewed
this
i
little
spendy
in
my
eyes
for
a
4
pack
equivalent
in
oz
to
a
5
pack
but
good
nonetheless
whos
your
fuckin
daddy
this
shit
is
so
good
seriously
though
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
with
a
nice
cappuccino
like
head
the
nose
is
straight
black
coffee
its
such
a
lovely
scent
the
taste
is
just
outstanding
very
coffee
forward
flavor
with
a
slight
hint
of
cherry
this
is
so
slick
i
love
this
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thing
and
acidic
the
coffee
and
slight
bit
of
cherry
lingers
throughout
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
marvelous
beer
i
wish
i
had
regular
access
to
this
good
shit
d
while
this
one
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
in
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
department
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
thin
body
and
light
carbonation
make
it
go
down
easy
with
a
nice
light
coffeecandy
bar
flavor
whats
not
to
like
right
o
another
win
for
the
surly
boys
i
really
really
like
it
a
to
a
beer
overall
this
is
a
truly
well
done
and
interesting
brew
whether
you
like
the
coffee
flavor
or
not
is
obviously
individual
i
really
liked
it
and
will
being
drinking
this
on
many
a
fallwinter
sunday
morning
skol
surly
cheers
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
this
tan
head
which
persists
smell
is
unmistakeably
coffee
it
actually
smells
more
like
coffee
than
beer
it
was
difficult
to
detect
any
hoppiness
malt
or
any
other
beer
characteristic
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
balanced
than
the
nose
behind
the
coffee
is
a
well
balanced
brown
ale
though
i
wish
i
had
sampled
the
regular
bender
so
that
i
would
have
had
a
base
from
which
to
understand
how
much
of
the
original
shines
through
the
mouthfeel
was
a
touch
thin
overall
it
is
an
interesting
beer
though
a
bit
onedimensional
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
balance
rather
than
the
coffee
taking
such
an
overwhelming
role
this
ended
up
reminding
me
of
some
kind
of
coffeeflavored
soda
not
bad
but
not
particularly
good
do
while
this
beverage
represents
a
remarkable
showcase
for
honest
coffee
qualities
it
is
fairly
mediocre
as
a
brown
ale
its
beer
qualities
remind
of
sierra
nevada
tumbler
a
little
too
dry
to
be
compelling
expect
it
to
lose
some
of
its
coffee
focus
as
it
warms
becoming
more
like
a
beer
but
still
fairly
lacking
in
distinct
qualities
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
less
than
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
for
the
given
level
of
coffee
flavor
overall
a
good
brew
but
the
standard
bender
is
better
in
my
opinion
the
complexity
is
ok
but
not
great
still
worth
having
one
or
two
very
much
a
coffee
beer
its
not
bad
but
a
big
to
heavy
handed
with
the
coffee
for
my
taste
drinkability
solid
4
3
if
i
could
so
im
rounding
up
a
bit
o
very
quality
brew
this
is
one
of
those
that
is
a
treat
to
enjoy
as
it
needs
to
be
shipped
in
from
out
of
state
this
is
the
coffee
beer
if
you
love
both
youll
enjoy
this
o
a
topnotch
brown
ale
with
a
great
coffeeinfused
flavor
drinks
way
too
easily
o
what
a
great
beer
while
the
nose
slightly
disappointed
me
the
taste
and
drinkability
more
than
made
up
for
it
nicely
integrated
flavors
and
no
taste
overpowered
the
other
overall
very
tasty
coffee
flavored
brown
ale
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
surly
makes
awesome
beers
overall
i
gave
it
good
smell
and
taste
scores
as
it
does
deliver
the
coffee
but
for
me
the
lack
of
other
noncoffee
flavors
really
limits
my
enjoyment
of
it
if
i
want
straight
coffee
ill
brew
up
a
batch
needs
more
balance
not
available
here
in
tx
got
from
ummagum
who
got
it
at
the
brewery
during
his
last
mn
trip
rotation
glad
i
tried
it
as
its
been
on
my
list
of
ones
i
really
wanted
to
try
but
one
is
enough
for
me
except
if
i
could
try
ontap
no
it
pretty
much
dominates
the
flavor
some
sweet
caramel
at
first
but
the
nuttiness
of
the
bender
thwarted
by
the
coffee
and
this
coffee
seems
thin
too
bad
some
nuttiness
would
provide
some
more
smoothness
seems
a
bit
hollow
and
not
like
a
brown
ale
much
at
all
still
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
twocanner
for
me
ogreat
mainstay
of
the
surly
line
up
was
really
impressed
with
the
balance
between
coffee
and
brown
ale
o
a
very
very
good
brown
i
find
it
significantly
tastier
than
regular
bender
just
a
bit
more
body
and
it
would
be
tremendous
this
one
was
shared
by
staywhatyouare2
with
beeruser
funkydelic
67couple
others
and
myself
at
a
recent
tasting
graciously
hosted
by
beeruser
served
from
can
into
a
duvel
parra
tulip
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
cream
coffee
and
subtle
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malt
coffee
subtle
caramel
and
cream
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
good
brew
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
quite
some
time
and
finally
got
the
chance
i
was
not
disappointed
at
all
in
this
one
i
dont
even
drink
coffee
and
loved
this
thing
cant
imagine
how
much
more
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
had
i
been
a
coffee
drinker
really
worth
trying
and
the
effort
to
get
your
hands
on
it
nice
job
surly
o
i
personally
really
enjoyed
this
offering
i
could
see
how
the
coffee
could
be
overpowering
if
youre
not
into
it
though
ill
definitely
buy
again
and
id
recomend
this
to
any
heavy
java
drinker
perfect
fall
beer
o
an
above
average
brown
ale
the
coffee
addition
is
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
elegant
flavorful
and
impressive
beers
i
have
had
in
the
5
abv
range
i
can
drink
these
all
night
long
in
any
kind
of
weather
o
a
tasty
brew
thats
almost
more
akin
to
a
carbonated
icedcoffee
than
a
beer
but
thats
still
delicious
in
my
book
received
in
trade
from
gpharris
thanks
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
deep
brown
with
garnet
highlights
when
held
to
light
tightly
bubbled
beige
head
shows
moderate
retention
and
lace
smells
like
freshly
ground
coffee
beans
mostly
i
try
to
find
something
else
in
the
aroma
but
the
coffee
is
overpowering
my
olfactory
system
taste
really
follows
the
aroma
upfront
i
get
bitter
roasted
coffee
midway
through
i
get
a
hint
of
sugary
sweetness
cream
maybe
finish
is
a
long
lingering
acridic
roasted
coffee
did
i
mention
this
tastes
like
coffee
medium
body
and
carbonation
level
acridic
bitter
mouthfeel
i
will
preface
this
by
saying
i
dont
drink
coffee
i
enjoy
some
beer
with
coffee
flavors
or
with
coffee
added
but
this
one
is
to
far
over
the
top
for
me
i
cant
find
the
beer
underneath
the
coffee
one
and
done
on
this
one
basically
this
beer
was
bender
hiding
behind
a
bunch
of
fine
coffee
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
like
bender
with
the
coffee
subtlety
just
a
little
more
accentuated
but
instead
it
was
overwhelming
perhaps
the
most
straight
up
coffee
taste
coffee
with
the
subtleties
of
bender
hiding
deep
behind
the
flavor
not
bad
and
if
you
love
coffee
much
preferable
but
basically
just
bender
with
a
twist
that
isnt
necessarily
praiseworthy
if
i
could
only
choose
one
still
stick
with
classic
bender
o
taste
is
disappointing
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
brew
worth
finding
and
giving
it
a
shot
thanks
for
the
trade
david
o
this
beer
isnt
trying
to
fool
you
its
coffee
all
the
way
good
stuff
o
great
coffee
infused
beer
if
you
want
a
beer
with
just
the
coffee
flavors
and
non
of
the
stout
qualities
many
coffee
infused
beers
have
this
is
the
one
o
the
beer
is
deceptive
in
that
it
has
strong
aromas
and
flavors
of
coffee
beans
for
not
that
full
of
a
body
but
this
also
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
go
down
very
easily
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
although
it
would
probably
to
do
so
in
the
afternoon
or
youll
be
up
all
night
with
a
coffee
buzz
o
very
good
brew
with
delicious
coffee
notes
that
are
not
too
overwhelming
great
overall
and
all
around
great
version
of
bender
that
imo
is
more
enjoyable
o
a
nice
lighter
coffee
beer
stout
like
flavors
without
the
heft
a
really
great
beer
i
like
the
coffee
flavour
here
which
is
the
star
of
the
show
without
being
a
diva
really
nice
pours
a
medium
brown
with
some
lacing
and
a
ring
of
head
tons
of
coffee
hits
in
the
nose
even
after
its
semi
aged
most
coffee
ive
ever
smelled
in
a
beer
before
kind
of
mono
dimensional
in
the
nose
but
i
have
to
say
its
pretty
wild
how
much
flavor
is
packed
in
the
taste
has
some
lactose
and
brown
sugary
notes
but
after
that
its
all
coffee
all
the
way
medium
mouth
with
lots
of
roast
narrative
i
just
dont
understand
why
the
early
seinfeld
episodes
look
so
dated
look
at
what
they
are
wearing
uncle
adam
droned
on
keep
it
together
jonah
keep
it
together
he
told
himself
as
he
clicked
the
rhythms
from
vengaboys
songs
along
his
jaw
line
he
didnt
exactly
mean
to
supplement
all
of
his
caffeine
habits
with
coffee
alcohol
but
such
is
the
way
of
things
jonah
are
you
cold
youre
positively
shaking
aunt
beatrice
exclaimed
grabbing
an
afghan
rug
yeahbut
you
know
who
really
i
mean
always
touching
the
thermostat
who
says
that
seinfeld
you
know
what
i
meanyeahyeah
notevencoldthough
seriously
he
attempted
to
break
his
repartee
into
at
least
dactylic
hexameter
for
his
relatives
to
try
and
understand
jonah
was
a
man
converted
to
the
alcoholic
coffee
beast
and
now
he
was
dropped
as
though
he
should
have
invented
the
rain
coat
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
oh
wait
im
reviewing
a
brown
ale
forgot
that
this
wasnt
a
stout
for
a
second
for
a
brown
ale
expectional
coffee
stout
brewers
take
note
this
is
how
you
do
it
this
is
not
only
a
great
example
of
coffee
in
beer
but
also
how
to
make
an
already
great
beer
greater
still
waiting
on
the
bender
experience
but
i
can
tell
im
in
for
a
treat
this
was
enjoyable
but
in
my
opinion
did
miss
in
some
areas
to
make
this
a
tremendous
beer
needs
more
of
a
kick
an
excellent
brown
ale
the
coffee
is
part
of
the
supporting
cast
and
is
not
the
star
of
the
show
like
some
other
coffee
beers
exceptionally
tasty
and
drinkable
overall
for
me
this
is
a
breakfast
beer
i
think
this
would
go
perfect
with
my
eggs
and
bacon
or
some
biscuits
and
gravy
i
really
like
the
flavor
and
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
soon
overall
i
loved
this
beer
big
coffee
in
this
which
i
love
just
to
damn
bad
i
cant
get
this
all
the
time
if
youenjoy
coffee
in
your
beers
get
ahold
of
some
of
this
for
sure
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
nice
sized
tan
head
tremendous
lacing
throughout
smell
is
big
coffee
complete
with
cream
taste
is
just
like
surly
describes
it
great
iced
coffee
flavor
slight
chocolate
notes
but
mostly
just
that
nice
taste
of
fresh
roasted
iced
coffee
a
tad
bit
dry
like
black
coffee
nice
light
mouthfeel
that
goes
perfect
with
the
taste
im
a
huge
fan
of
coffee
beers
and
only
recently
have
had
low
abv
brown
ales
brewed
with
coffee
and
i
have
to
say
its
a
refreshing
literally
change
from
big
huge
coffee
stouts
at
this
time
of
year
the
big
difference
between
this
one
and
a
lot
of
coffee
beers
is
it
tastes
more
like
brewed
coffee
whereas
others
seem
to
taste
more
like
the
beans
themselves
summer
is
when
i
switch
from
hot
coffee
to
iced
coffee
and
this
is
the
perfect
dark
summer
brew
ive
heard
great
things
about
surly
and
this
first
offering
lived
up
to
expectations
good
but
not
great
got
some
other
surly
beers
to
try
in
the
coming
week
pours
deep
brown
with
a
touch
of
red
and
a
medium
tannish
head
looks
good
smells
straight
up
like
strong
cold
coffee
pretty
substantial
with
only
a
hint
of
malts
or
anything
else
the
taste
is
basically
just
a
carbonated
cup
of
cold
coffee
with
a
slight
bit
of
malt
sweetness
tastes
shockingly
like
coffee
not
really
anything
else
going
on
medium
thin
on
the
body
with
good
carbonation
seems
a
bit
light
for
the
coffee
flavor
this
beer
is
really
interesting
but
the
beer
element
is
lost
its
like
drinking
a
cup
of
cold
coffee
that
has
had
enough
sweetener
added
to
make
it
not
too
bitter
kind
of
tough
to
grade
would
have
again
though
not
a
favorite
cheers
othis
is
a
great
coffee
beer
and
i
feel
its
better
than
the
original
bender
its
a
great
beer
with
an
outstanding
flavor
profile
along
with
great
balance
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beers
right
now
i
could
easily
drink
this
daily
and
wish
i
lived
in
mn
so
i
could
get
it
more
often
pours
an
almost
opaque
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
1
inch
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
smells
of
dark
malts
and
coffee
grounds
fresh
from
a
machine
taste
is
of
carbonated
black
coffee
and
maybe
some
dark
malt
extremely
coffee
forward
with
a
lingering
bitterness
on
the
palate
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
coffee
overpowers
any
other
smells
or
tastes
that
may
be
present
in
this
beer
i
tend
to
love
beers
with
coffee
added
but
this
one
was
just
gross
i
guess
i
could
have
gotten
an
off
can
but
i
tend
to
think
this
beer
is
just
not
for
me
so
take
this
review
as
you
will
canned

is
all
about
the
coffee
taste
roasty
espresso
dark
coffee
flavors
here
a
little
sweetness
from
the
malt
am
i
drinking
coffee
or
beer
here
very
hard
to
tell
only
thing
that
really
sets
them
apart
is
the
carbonation
mouthfeel
nice
silky
smooth
drinkability
if
you
love
coffee
you
will
love
this
if
you
dont
love
coffee
i
cant
see
how
this
could
possibly
be
enjoyable
but
i
love
coffee
so
there
you
go
nice
job
surly
o
very
solid
brown
ale
i
havent
had
the
regular
bender
to
compare
but
im
a
fan
of
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
letting
some
light
in
around
the
edges
cap
of
stiff
creamy
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
scent
is
of
fresh
brewed
black
coffee
on
top
of
a
carmely
sweet
and
nutty
brown
ale
base
taste
is
a
bit
deeper
then
nose
lead
towards
coffee
is
fresher
more
bean
then
brewed
and
mingles
perfectly
with
a
rich
nutty
light
chocolaty
fresh
grain
and
malty
sweet
brown
ale
base
the
hallmark
of
surly
beers
continues
to
be
the
smooth
creamy
body
all
of
their
beers
acheive
and
the
oats
in
this
beer
only
continue
to
contribute
to
that
overall
well
balanced
between
coffee
and
brown
ale
o
overall
this
one
was
a
homerun
for
me
i
think
i
said
it
in
a
past
review
but
ive
been
in
love
with
everything
from
surly
that
ive
tried
this
is
a
very
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
beer
like
my
new
mug
says
its
never
too
early
to
get
surly
i
could
seriously
see
myself
drinking
this
with
breakfast
overall
as
a
lover
of
coffee
beers
this
is
definatly
at
the
top
of
my
list
one
of
the
more
memorable
beers
of
the
night
which
included
almost
the
whole
surly
lineup
including
darkness
four
and
smoke
o
i
really
like
the
beer
and
would
probably
select
it
over
the
original
bender
but
just
barely
they
present
different
features
both
good
but
the
coffee
flavor
is
very
well
done
and
very
enticing
o
decent
not
great
as
i
had
hopes
for
but
it
did
save
face
in
the
end
i
look
forward
to
trying
regular
bender
to
get
a
better
grasp
on
the
base
beer
before
trying
this
again
im
really
digging
this
beer
right
now
its
not
too
thick
to
drink
in
the
summer
should
make
for
a
great
early
morning
camping
beer
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
was
expecting
the
coffee
to
be
a
little
bit
stronger
in
this
one
but
that
wouldve
taken
away
its
insane
drinkability
so
i
cant
complain
surly
needs
to
find
a
way
to
make
their
selves
available
in
socal
they
continue
to
impress
me
and
i
expect
the
impressing
wont
end
any
time
soon
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
much
better
than
anticipated
normally
i
wouldnt
buy
a
canned
beer
this
beer
by
no
means
screams
out
drink
me
im
delicious
like
alot
of
bottle
beers
do
in
fact
my
wife
thought
i
was
drinking
a
root
beer
but
thanks
to
dearthvader
for
the
gift
i
got
to
experience
and
enjoy
this
lovely
canned
beer
extremely
drinkable
call
this
one
founders
breakfast
stout
light
or
fbs
lite
whatever
you
get
the
picture
great
beer
here
coffee
bender
is
a
great
beer
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
or
on
a
colder
fall
evening
great
for
all
occasions
o
so
after
reading
this
is
billed
as
a
brown
ale
im
quite
impressed
as
i
thought
it
was
a
porter
really
nice
beer
after
drinking
both
bender
and
coffee
bender
in
consecutive
nights
both
are
great
examples
of
a
flavorful
and
aromatic
brown
ale
something
that
can
be
hard
to
find
at
times
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
more
surly
offerings
if
when
i
get
the
chance
thanks
to
bstyle
for
leaving
this
pounder
behind
o
very
drinkable
this
was
my
second
beer
from
surly
and
it
was
another
success
in
my
book
i
just
wish
i
could
go
down
the
street
to
my
local
liquor
store
and
pick
up
a
4
pack
of
any
of
their
stuff
especially
abrasive
another
great
job
surly
another
solid
surly
brew
i
think
while
the
original
bender
does
lend
itself
to
some
coffee
flavors
with
the
coffee
additions
here
you
lose
a
lot
of
that
great
mouthfeel
from
the
oats
and
a
sort
of
tart
bitterness
takes
over
would
definitely
have
another
but
would
prefer
to
stick
to
the
original
really
overall
i
prefer
bender
they
are
both
great
brown
ales
however
the
coffee
takes
over
a
lot
of
the
nuances
in
bender
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
def
one
of
my
favorite
coffee
to
date
at
11
504pack
it
might
carry
a
little
heavfty
of
a
price
tag
though
a
lighter
more
drinkable
beer
with
a
great
coffee
profile
i
like
that
it
is
5
abv
and
you
could
easily
pick
up
a
pack
and
drink
a
few
i
am
used
to
very
big
stouts
infused
with
coffee
but
this
breaks
that
trend
for
me
this
was
an
odd
beer
for
me
that
reminded
me
of
a
homebrew
brown
ale
i
added
coffee
to
just
to
see
which
process
for
adding
the
coffee
worked
best
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
but
the
coffee
and
beer
did
not
seem
to
meld
together
you
tasted
the
coffee
and
then
the
brown
ale
as
opposed
to
some
of
the
better
coffee
stouts
where
the
flavors
blend
in
together
and
you
get
a
more
cohesive
flavor
profile
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
were
good
nice
and
dry
and
drinkable
as
well
with
good
body
for
the
style
the
nose
was
coffee
slight
roastinesstoasty
grains
and
no
hop
aroma
overall
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
maybe
then
ill
get
it
o
overall
surly
gets
an
a
for
effort
id
drink
this
again
and
id
recommend
it
to
others
but
im
thinking
theres
a
reason
that
you
dont
see
too
many
coffeeflavored
brown
ales
its
good
but
wont
win
any
awards
love
the
cb
and
always
have
a
few
in
the
fridge
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
not
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
the
coffee
is
not
the
star
in
this
beer
but
rather
a
player
of
many
in
this
brown
ale
great
brown
ale
but
i
feel
like
they
missed
the
mark
with
the
coffee
a
little
bit
o
ive
only
had
2
brews
from
surly
though
both
have
been
utterly
fantastic
glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
hope
i
can
acquire
some
more
sometime
soon
o
love
it
and
the
name
serves
it
well
if
i
were
coming
off
a
bender
this
beer
would
be
ideal
definitely
worth
seeking
out
from
the
mn
bas
although
it
is
a
bit
pricey
this
is
morning
breakfast
beer
right
here
lots
of
great
fresh
brewed
morning
coffee
without
a
giant
big
stout
like
body
superior
win
right
out
of
the
gate
overall
really
just
muddled
if
its
going
to
be
s
coffee
beer
it
might
as
well
go
for
it
the
hops
dont
play
nice
in
my
book
just
missing
a
little
something
overall
again
im
a
sucker
for
this
style
i
love
the
balance
of
this
beer
and
i
really
hope
that
im
able
to
get
some
more
in
the
future
o
very
nice
beer
easy
drinkability
if
you
love
coffee
this
will
hit
the
spot
love
the
coffee
taste
mixed
with
the
sweet
maltiness
very
well
balanced
highly
recommend
trying
this
at
least
once
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
with
a
small
light
tan
head
the
smell
of
this
is
pure
coffee
as
you
might
expect
a
little
bit
of
sweet
notes
but
pretty
much
all
coffee
the
taste
is
really
great
on
this
lots
of
coffee
but
not
as
much
as
the
smell
would
suggest
just
a
great
brown
ale
with
a
compliment
of
coffee
good
carbonation
and
and
a
good
medium
body
overall
a
very
tasty
coffee
brown
that
i
would
drink
all
the
time
if
i
was
in
minnesota
d
very
drinkable
the
added
coffee
flavors
are
really
strong
and
excellent
on
top
of
the
brown
ale
everything
feels
right
in
place
and
mixes
very
well
together
o
it
is
surly
always
worth
trying
and
continual
replenishment
overall
this
beer
improved
on
bender
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
good
coffee
flavors
and
very
drinkable
worth
seeking
out
if
you
enjoy
coffee
infused
beers
poured
from
a
can
into
my
ccb
pint
glass
dark
brown
in
appearance
with
a
paper
thin
head
aroma
is
all
coffee
wow
so
much
coffee
taste
follows
the
nose
coffee
takes
over
and
knocks
out
the
complexity
of
bender
light
carbonation
and
somewhat
thick
coffee
bender
isnt
as
good
as
its
big
brother
the
coffee
takes
away
from
what
makes
bender
so
complex
i
like
coffee
beers
this
one
just
might
be
a
little
too
much
o
i
would
drink
it
again
for
the
price
and
the
alcohol
content
its
a
tasty
beer
to
not
get
blasted
off
of
d
the
coffee
comes
through
with
such
strength
that
it
almost
seems
like
a
novelty
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
a
partial
can
without
getting
sick
of
it
its
exactly
what
the
brewer
had
in
mind
its
just
not
really
my
thing
check
it
out
if
you
cant
seem
to
get
enough
coffee
now
i
really
want
to
try
the
regular
bender
i
also
find
myself
wishing
that
surly
would
commission
this
recipe
for
a
clone
kit
through
northern
brewer
while
i
dont
like
using
kits
anymore
id
likely
buy
a
coffee
bender
clone
kit
in
a
heartbeat
overall
its
unlike
any
brew
ive
had
in
san
diego
im
very
impressed
however
overall
the
beer
is
an
average
sampling
in
my
book
i
would
definitely
try
it
again
recommend
it
to
a
friend
and
could
easily
sip
this
beer
all
day
d
this
is
extremely
drinkable
very
flavorful
very
well
balanced
no
hint
of
alcohol
and
an
appropriate
mouthfeel
make
this
really
easy
to
put
down
id
have
another
one
or
two
if
i
had
any
more
of
this
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
watery
but
the
carbonation
is
spoton
and
the
drinkability
is
absolutely
exceptional
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
just
a
super
solid
coffee
beer
its
not
a
stunner
but
absolutely
a
delicious
solid
brew
highly
recommended
this
is
a
great
low
abv
beer
for
coffee
lovers
unfortunately
i
am
not
a
coffee
lover
hence
the
low
ranking
here
poured
from
fresh
can
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
few
reddish
hues
inch
thick
dense
and
creamy
brown
head
that
dissipates
slowly
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
aroma
has
lots
of
fresh
coffee
up
front
when
this
warms
up
a
bit
some
nice
roasts
caramels
and
toffee
brown
malts
come
out
a
light
chocolate
nuts
and
vanilla
flavor
is
similar
lots
of
fresh
espresso
coffee
with
a
nice
rich
brown
maltiness
caramel
chocolate
roast
vanilla
some
biscuit
and
a
light
earth
finishes
dry
and
lightly
bitter
with
lots
of
coffee
and
a
nice
earthy
roast
lengthy
aftertaste
following
a
medium
somewhat
watery
body
at
times
and
a
moderate
creamy
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
same
as
the
original
bender
but
the
flavors
are
exponentially
better
in
this
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
three
best
coffee
beers
i
have
ever
had
maybe
a
bit
too
tilted
to
the
coffee
side
but
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
especially
for
the
abv
sessionable
definitely
recommended
definitely
if
i
was
given
the
choice
of
this
compared
to
the
original
bender
i
would
take
this
10
times
out
of
10
overall
this
is
one
of
the
finest
and
most
unique
coffee
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
can
safely
say
that
this
is
also
the
only
sessionable
coffee
beer
i
have
ever
seen
and
would
love
to
seek
this
one
out
again
o
a
very
pleasant
supremely
refreshing
sessionable
coffee
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
glad
i
bought
two
4packs
instead
of
one
ill
be
ordering
this
again
very
soon
overall
a
very
solid
ale
that
almost
seems
more
iced
coffee
than
a
beer
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
brew
o
i
wish
i
lived
closer
than
six
hours
to
mn
so
i
could
get
this
beer
more
often
its
absolutely
delicious
and
may
be
one
of
the
best
yearround
beers
anywhere
easily
up
there
with
two
hearted
really
nothing
to
complain
about
with
this
great
offering
from
surly
overall
if
you
like
coffee
you
need
to
try
this
if
you
like
flavored
fake
coffeestay
away
md
very
carbonated
had
an
interesting
iced
coffee
thing
going
on
the
coffee
flavor
did
not
seem
to
be
of
the
highest
quality
but
it
was
still
tasty
nonetheless
pretty
good
beer
easy
to
drink
for
sure
and
i
like
that
its
in
cans
d
i
would
have
another
one
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
on
a
regular
basis
tasted
too
much
like
an
iced
coffee
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
almost
indistinguishable
from
a
typical
coffee
stout
i
pick
up
on
a
slight
nuttiness
in
the
finish
but
thats
about
the
only
brown
ale
characteristic
this
beer
has
you
could
put
it
in
a
lineup
of
coffee
stouts
and
likely
not
be
able
to
pick
it
out
as
a
brown
ale
its
almost
unrecognizable
and
as
a
coffee
stout
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
from
the
pack
somehow
the
addition
of
coffee
seems
to
have
taken
away
a
bit
of
benders
complexity
its
neither
the
best
coffee
beer
or
the
best
brown
but
the
can
is
still
disappearing
down
my
maw
pretty
quickly
o
really
good
light
flavor
of
coffee
that
isnt
overpowering
or
too
potent
tastes
just
like
an
iced
coffee
thanks
again
chris
o
another
solid
beer
by
surly
this
is
average
to
above
average
nothing
here
really
wows
me
but
then
again
there
is
nothing
to
complain
about
either
o
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
this
i
would
be
all
over
it
this
beer
is
super
tasty
it
combines
two
of
my
three
favorite
beverages
in
one
can
and
does
a
fine
job
of
it
the
abv
is
also
low
enough
to
make
this
a
beer
you
could
have
a
few
of
in
a
session
i
would
love
to
take
this
camping
would
be
a
great
way
to
start
the
post
dinner
camp
fire
huddle
mouthfeel
is
the
same
as
bender
slightly
watery
smooth
and
with
creamy
moments
but
with
these
flavors
it
works
so
much
better
drinkability
is
helped
a
great
deal
by
the
balance
on
the
coffee
as
it
isnt
just
raw
beans
with
no
sweetness
added
the
caramel
and
toffee
from
the
nose
mist
be
doing
it
even
if
i
cant
pick
them
out
specifically
on
the
tongue
great
great
beer
and
a
confirmation
of
why
surly
has
the
reputation
it
does
overall
maybe
this
style
just
isnt
up
my
alley
a
tasty
beverage
at
any
rate
definitely
recommended
the
highlight
was
the
overall
smoothness
of
the
beer
its
good
but
as
far
as
coffee
beers
go
not
one
of
the
best
not
much
complexity
the
cpj
if
i
want
a
coffee
beer
i
would
chose
a
coffee
stout
instead
of
this
the
brown
ale
and
coffee
just
seems
like
an
odd
pairing
to
me
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
the
only
beer
from
surly
that
i
have
disliked
thus
far
d
enjoyable
for
its
style
the
coffee
is
slightly
overpowering
but
i
was
still
glad
to
try
a
tallboy
of
it
md
warms
real
well
in
the
glass
creamy
and
rich
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
d
pretty
good
a
little
more
watereddown
than
youd
expect
but
decent
flavors
for
the
lower
alcohol
d
damn
fine
beer
if
i
didnt
have
an
aversion
to
caffeine
i
think
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
compared
to
a
couple
years
ago
i
really
get
the
balance
in
this
beer
d
a
very
nice
blend
of
flavors
with
a
light
body
that
makes
this
beer
quite
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
smooth
and
substantial
in
the
mouth
not
some
some
of
the
thinner
abas
i
have
had
all
around
a
solid
brew
and
my
first
from
surly
quite
drinkable
nice
to
see
a
beer
that
infuses
coffee
without
being
over
the
top
with
alcohol
and
flavor
nicely
done
very
well
balanced
probably
my
favorite
coffee
beer
ive
had
to
date
poured
from
a
16
ounce
can
into
an
efes
tulip
moderate
beige
head
sticks
around
for
a
moment
atop
a
murky
dark
brown
body
sticky
soapy
and
mainly
clear
lacing
lines
the
glass
aroma
includes
malty
sweetness
coffee
caramel
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
taste
is
loaded
with
good
things
happening
coffee
dominates
but
again
notes
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
maybe
praline
really
impressive
d
i
could
do
2
in
a
row
at
max
but
i
will
be
picking
it
up
next
time
i
see
it
the
mouth
feel
is
my
only
slight
complaint
its
just
slightly
more
carbonated
than
i
would
like
and
slightly
on
the
thin
side
but
again
very
small
complaints
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
over
all
pretty
tasty
drinkability
one
of
the
few
times
i
dont
think
coffee
makes
a
beer
better
i
find
it
a
little
bit
overwhelming
especially
in
the
aroma
maybe
it
was
the
type
of
coffee
that
i
just
did
not
connect
with
coffee
bender
pours
out
a
very
dark
shade
of
brown
appearing
mudy
black
with
a
inch
or
so
of
bright
tan
semi
mocha
colored
foam
that
left
some
stickies
this
smells
like
some
dank
ass
coffee
and
tastes
like
it
as
well
a
nice
roast
in
the
middle
finished
by
more
coffee
beans
upon
beans
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
nuts
so
the
base
brown
is
not
completely
lost
butnthis
one
is
all
about
the
coffee
feel
is
very
slick
and
feels
thicker
than
it
is
with
all
that
roast
about
lightish
in
body
with
a
ample
carb
this
is
a
lighter
version
of
breakfast
stout
with
a
lower
abv
making
it
much
more
drinkable
this
one
is
a
winner
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
and
definitely
one
which
will
appeal
to
the
coffee
fans
among
us
this
beer
seems
to
have
a
lot
going
for
it
and
i
would
certainly
seek
out
future
trades
for
more
do
very
drinkable
brown
ale
even
with
the
coffee
flavors
d
i
love
this
beer
another
great
brew
from
surly
not
much
else
to
say
if
you
are
a
fan
of
coffee
beers
this
beer
should
be
on
the
top
of
your
list
i
love
coffee
even
more
so
i
love
beer
was
kinda
nervous
that
i
was
going
to
be
upset
with
such
a
mix
but
knowing
the
surlys
rep
i
figured
id
give
this
coffee
bender
a
crack
i
was
w
o
r
n
g
this
was
a
supurb
balace
of
beer
and
coffee
flavor
not
sure
how
this
works
but
it
was
acully
very
refresing
wich
isnt
the
first
thing
that
come
to
mind
when
i
think
about
coffee
this
could
very
easily
replace
lineys
berry
as
my
new
moring
beer
this
beer
opened
up
a
new
ave
for
me
to
try
diffrent
beers
great
work
and
cheers
to
the
lads
at
surly
another
winner
from
surly
other
brews
might
fulfill
your
coffeemochachocolate
longings
better
but
this
is
one
great
beer
it
is
a
surly
so
i
guess
you
expect
that
overall
a
very
nice
brown
ale
if
you
love
coffee
not
your
typical
brown
ale
by
any
means
very
nice
cheers
beertracker
drinkability
i
like
it
i
would
definitely
have
another
but
i
dont
know
about
more
than
one
more
i
feel
like
id
fill
up
on
this
pretty
quickly
given
the
flavours
and
the
heavier
mouthfeel
d
a
unique
beer
definitely
had
its
brown
ale
characteristics
which
is
a
nice
change
from
typical
coffeeinfused
porters
and
stouts
d
yes
i
would
like
to
go
on
a
bender
with
this
bad
boy
i
enjoyed
its
base
beer
very
much
but
this
one
is
amazing
so
easy
to
drink
but
you
could
spend
hours
on
it
picking
it
to
pieces
one
of
my
new
favs
damm
surly
not
a
bad
beer
yet
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
for
1030
am
on
a
sunday
i
want
more
if
you
like
brown
ales
or
coffee
or
both
you
must
try
this
beer
much
thanks
to
justin
for
this
extra
poured
gently
for
a
1finger
head
reduces
quickly
to
thin
film
and
has
that
familiar
smooth
surly
lacing
color
is
deep
brown
aroma
of
very
fresh
roasted
ground
coffee
beans
and
thats
it
taste
is
exactly
the
same
with
maybe
a
touch
of
chocolate
this
is
certainly
different
from
any
other
coffee
beer
ive
ever
drank
its
like
an
iced
coffee
im
not
sure
anything
else
can
be
said
this
is
a
smooth
session
beer
for
those
that
are
obsessed
with
coffee
like
myself
overall
it
is
a
nice
beer
enjoyable
and
not
overly
aggressive
thanks
jon
and
theres
the
coffee
the
initial
taste
is
still
chocolate
malt
but
the
coffee
bitterness
jumps
in
and
finishes
strong
the
transition
from
dark
malt
to
coffee
bitter
is
smooth
and
well
done
as
a
beer
geek
and
a
coffee
nut
i
could
drink
this
all
day
ive
definitely
had
it
with
my
breakfast
before
its
lighter
than
a
coffee
stout
and
as
a
result
significantly
more
drinkable
d
its
solid
but
not
that
interesting
if
i
were
local
i
can
see
it
being
better
than
my
average
local
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
its
very
easy
to
drink
in
general
didnt
have
any
problem
putting
this
one
away
dthis
was
so
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
couldnt
get
enough
of
it
had
take
it
away
from
my
woman
because
she
wasnt
gonna
volunter
to
give
it
back
after
a
taste
if
you
dig
coffee
search
this
one
out
medium
bodied
with
some
tight
carbonation
up
front
that
smooths
out
midpalate
very
roasty
wiu
a
huge
coffee
bean
presence
but
this
beer
is
never
to
acrid
or
dry
there
is
planety
of
rich
chocolate
maltiness
as
well
as
some
caramel
toffee
and
nut
to
balance
things
out
well
balanced
complex
delicious
and
very
quaffable
recommended
especially
for
breakfast
d
really
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
in
the
morning
with
my
breakfast
its
not
quite
coffee
and
its
not
quite
beer
but
a
nice
mixture
of
the
two
if
youre
a
coffee
drinker
this
is
right
up
your
ally
drinkability
very
high
this
is
a
coffee
lovers
beer
as
the
name
suggests
this
isns
an
espresso
bomb
at
all
rather
the
coffee
is
very
nicely
integrated
with
bender
which
is
a
fabulous
brown
ale
of
its
own
right
thankfully
its
readily
available
to
me
down
the
street
at
my
neighborhood
liquour
store
d
drinkability
is
high
an
incredibly
balanced
coffee
beer
that
brings
a
ton
to
the
table
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
i
could
imagine
tailgating
with
this
all
morning
if
only
i
could
find
it
around
here
d
absolutely
loved
this
one
the
only
beer
i
know
of
rivaling
this
one
in
the
coffee
dept
is
terrapins
wake
n
bake
a
must
try
for
anyone
that
enjoys
coffee
notes
pretty
good
very
intense
coffee
tastes
a
bit
too
carbonated
and
light
in
body
though
the
intense
coffee
flavors
feel
a
bit
out
of
place
without
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
to
back
them
up
this
is
a
beer
that
im
very
glad
i
tried
but
i
wouldnt
jump
through
hoops
to
get
more
of
it
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
a
perfect
way
to
start
a
sunday
morning
d
for
this
style
and
flavor
profile
this
is
about
as
drinkable
as
they
come
i
could
easily
session
this
delicious
coffee
brew
mda
bit
watery
but
counter
balanced
with
the
bitterness
slides
down
the
gullet
quite
easily
but
leaves
a
bit
of
an
unpleasant
overly
bitter
drying
vibe
in
my
mouth
which
fades
to
a
much
more
pleasant
chocolate
bar
feel
pours
incredibly
dark
a
bit
of
head
but
fairly
settled
not
too
carbonated
smells
strongly
of
coffee
and
malt
very
pleasant
on
the
nose
definitely
tastes
like
coffee
coffee
coffee
not
much
else
to
it
the
malt
profile
peaks
through
a
hair
but
the
coffee
overpowers
great
smooth
mouthfeel
but
overall
not
much
of
a
brown
ale
taste
through
the
overly
coffee
flavoured
beer
d
the
acidic
coffee
bitterness
hangs
around
for
awhile
but
i
could
definitely
pound
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
d
very
redrinkable
i
bought
a
4
pack
of
it
and
i
guarantee
it
wont
be
the
last
4
pack
i
buy
of
it
the
first
one
tasted
like
more
one
of
the
best
dark
beers
i
have
ever
had
66th
reveal
is
surly
coffee
bender
wait
really
huh
i
was
expecting
something
i
dont
know
better
this
beer
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
a
good
finger
of
coarse
beige
foam
to
top
it
off
the
aroma
is
damn
fine
for
obvious
reasons
the
main
aroma
is
a
robust
coffee
but
surprisingly
i
was
able
to
detect
a
bit
of
flower
notes
from
the
hops
as
well
as
a
nice
caramel
glaze
and
some
brown
sugar
the
taste
has
the
distinct
notes
of
coffee
in
it
almost
as
the
one
and
only
flavor
the
background
notes
to
the
palate
are
some
aggressive
hop
bitterness
that
i
must
admit
doesnt
really
work
here
however
if
you
can
tell
your
mind
that
this
is
just
an
alcoholic
strong
coffee
not
moonshot
lol
it
actually
goes
down
rather
smoothly
the
body
is
a
lot
thinner
than
i
would
have
imagined
it
being
but
this
beer
is
still
a
damn
fine
drinking
beer
it
was
initially
too
strong
for
me
but
honestly
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
really
am
loving
it
a
really
nice
beer
god
i
wish
we
still
had
surly
down
in
chicago
i
have
to
laugh
at
the
fact
surly
classifies
this
as
a
brown
ale
ive
had
reputable
porters
with
less
balls
than
this
this
is
one
pronounced
and
articulate
coffee
infused
ale
for
sure
not
one
tasty
facet
of
this
brew
tastes
contrived
or
outofbalance
imagine
a
roasty
chocolatey
coffee
inspired
beer
of
your
dreams
and
youve
got
it
right
here
in
spades
d
for
a
coffee
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
very
easy
drinking
beer
definitely
more
than
a
coffee
stout
or
porter
d
this
stuff
has
to
stay
on
my
wants
list
i
could
have
used
a
second
can
d
good
drinkable
beer
gets
a
little
boring
halfway
through
with
the
flavors
to
it
i
would
prefer
a
stout
rather
than
brown
ale
with
coffee
where
there
seems
to
be
more
substance
to
it
still
not
bad
could
drink
more
if
had
some
its
also
low
enough
in
the
abv
to
sip
morning
noon
and
night
and
the
fact
that
its
secretly
still
a
wonderful
brown
ale
under
all
that
coffee
makes
it
uber
drinkable
poured
into
a
shaped
pint
with
a
chestnut
brown
body
and
a
big
foamy
tan
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
and
a
nice
ring
of
foam
in
the
glass
smells
nutty
and
like
ground
roasted
coffee
slightly
bitter
tastes
like
cocoa
and
hazelnut
with
roasted
coffee
slightly
acidicbitter
and
creamy
sweet
feels
viscous
due
to
moderate
carbonation
and
it
has
a
thicker
body
very
nice
drinking
and
very
tasty
glad
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
to
enjoy
smells
like
a
dark
roasted
coffee
and
a
can
of
mixed
nuts
which
pairs
pretty
good
imo
how
does
surly
maintain
the
complexities
of
bender
yet
still
add
all
of
that
rich
coffee
flavor
it
doesnt
matter
to
me
what
does
matter
is
that
this
is
one
tasty
beer
sweet
malts
pecans
and
walnuts
and
of
course
a
big
fat
cup
of
joe
smooth
mouthfeel
maybe
to
thin
for
some
but
its
a
5
beer
so
i
feel
its
supposed
to
be
thin
very
easy
to
drink
i
love
coffee
beers
and
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
d
very
drinkable
easy
to
have
two
or
three
it
is
on
the
thin
side
but
it
is
quite
good
not
as
much
coffee
as
had
hoped
but
very
workable
if
only
it
made
me
younger
and
not
sore
from
football
then
itd
really
be
a
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
browns
out
there
many
browns
are
bland
coffee
bender
has
solved
that
problem
d
drinks
well
for
a
coffee
ale
i
tend
to
find
my
taste
buds
burnt
after
one
but
i
could
easily
have
2
of
these
guys
d
this
goes
down
easy
but
i
have
to
say
i
prefer
regular
bender
coffee
stouts
too
often
taste
like
cheap
gas
station
coffee
i
get
it
you
used
coffee
but
work
on
the
balance
and
the
bean
a
bit
moderate
to
light
body
that
plays
to
a
cold
coffee
feeling
carbonation
is
not
weak
but
not
biting
plenty
of
bitterness
with
no
astringency
crack
glug
time
two
quick
fingers
worth
of
thick
deeptan
head
with
great
retention
and
a
wafting
odor
of
coffee
greeted
me
on
the
pour
color
was
a
deep
rich
brown
with
ruby
highlights
nose
was
a
knockout
it
was
like
walking
into
starbucks
and
taking
a
deep
breath
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
their
coffee
but
it
does
smell
deelish
i
had
some
coffee
earlier
this
am
cowboystyle
warmed
up
in
the
microwave
from
yesterday
and
i
wanted
to
see
how
this
would
measure
up
mouthfeel
was
creamy
with
a
very
roasty
coffee
flavor
up
front
followed
by
a
dark
chocolate
bitterness
behind
wow
iced
coffee
was
never
this
good
finish
was
bitter
i
mean
good
coffee
bitter
but
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
holy
heart
palpitations
batman
i
was
more
jittery
than
a
longtailed
cat
in
a
roomful
of
rocking
chairs
zounds
more
please
sir
fk
joose
or
four
loko
this
is
all
the
caffeine
and
alcohol
youll
need
poured
from
can
into
a
shaker
glass
color
is
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
small
head
that
lingered
for
a
few
sips
aromas
of
roasted
malt
a
little
chocolate
and
lots
of
fresh
coffee
full
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
taste
was
like
drinking
sweetened
iced
coffee
in
a
can
and
with
the
alcohol
content
not
being
all
that
high
i
could
do
two
or
three
of
these
over
the
course
of
an
evening
great
job
surly
thanks
dan
and
megan
for
bringing
this
one
over
last
night
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
color
with
a
smallish
light
tan
head
huge
freshly
ground
espresso
on
the
nose
along
with
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
full
bodied
creamy
and
rich
like
cold
canned
coffee
with
rich
milk
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
and
a
lingering
coffee
finish
very
good
this
is
the
best
brown
ale
by
a
longshot
in
my
book
d
really
nice
i
opened
this
to
drink
during
a
sunday
afternoon
eagles
game
and
it
went
down
very
easily
this
was
my
first
surly
and
definately
wont
be
my
last
d
a
delicious
brew
with
a
sessionable
abv
that
i
could
sip
all
night
darkness
day
notes
if
you
had
to
pick
a
beer
to
be
served
to
you
at
8am
in
a
cold
dark
industrial
park
in
mn
this
is
definitely
in
the
top
5
yum
good
drinkability
but
1
or
2
would
probably
do
the
trick
for
me
in
a
sitting
just
not
as
smooth
and
drinkable
as
original
which
i
like
much
better
omg
this
stuff
is
amazing
poured
in
a
pint
glass
nice
dark
brown
with
a
lovely
tan
head
take
of
whiff
of
this
stuff
amazing
says
coffee
through
and
through
first
sip
is
nice
and
creamy
with
a
great
finish
didnt
take
too
long
to
finish
it
and
open
another
but
before
i
did
i
smelled
the
last
of
the
first
one
in
a
blind
test
i
bet
a
lot
of
people
would
say
it
is
just
coffee

d
maybe
one
depending
on
the
other
choices
absolutely
dynamite
fusion
of
coffee
flavor
and
beer
a
must
try
and
rebuy
d
i
could
have
this
breakfast
lunch
and
dinner
very
easy
to
drink
love
this
beer
iso
more
its
never
too
early
for
surly
drinkability
is
a
really
good
although
seems
a
little
boozy
if
that
can
be
at
5
abv
when
cold
as
it
warms
it
changes
in
a
real
way
just
different
not
worse
or
better
overall
a
very
interesting
drink
drinkability
quite
so
for
this
type
of
brew
a
damn
impressive
brown
ale
for
sure
d
easy
drinking
but
seemed
to
be
lacking
something
enjoyed
the
beer
but
wish
the
coffee
had
a
bigger
presence
finally
i
get
to
try
one
of
surlys
regular
brews
this
one
pours
a
lovely
ruby
brown
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
light
ecru
foam
the
nose
is
dominated
by
a
light
coffee
breeze
while
some
chocolate
toffee
and
maple
syrup
form
a
sturdy
foundation
beneath
the
taste
is
very
similar
though
the
coffee
doesnt
assert
itself
as
much
until
the
finish
instead
it
shares
the
spotlight
with
cocoa
and
maple
syrup
the
latter
two
spiraling
into
the
wings
to
allow
for
the
coffees
final
aria
the
body
is
a
staunch
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
fizzily
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
can
now
understand
how
this
thing
has
such
a
strong
reputation
round
these
parts
poured
this
into
my
pint
glass
its
a
deep
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
with
decent
lacing
i
love
the
smell
of
this
one
it
has
a
nice
nutty
wooden
aroma
with
a
big
coffee
smell
the
coffee
is
really
well
done
it
comes
through
predominantly
but
doesnt
overpower
anything
the
taste
is
a
bi
coffee
flavor
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
nuts
it
finishes
slightly
bitter
it
really
reminds
me
of
an
ice
coffee
with
just
a
bit
of
cream
and
sugar
really
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
slightly
carbonated
with
a
smooth
medium
body
i
really
wish
i
had
this
stuff
local
probably
my
favorite
brown
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
cheers
it
would
be
nice
to
pour
this
from
the
coffee
pot
every
morning
great
beer
my
2nd
favorite
of
surlys
regulars
very
good
beer
here
if
you
like
coffee
andor
brown
ales
try
this
already
overall
a
very
good
coffee
beer
that
isnt
bigoverpowering
like
a
stout
i
somehow
feel
this
was
actually
made
better
by
drinking
it
out
of
my
surly
coffee
mug
maybe
it
is
never
to
early
to
get
surly
my
first
surly
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
another
great
flavors
and
really
drinkable
d
goes
down
easy
i
like
how
subtle
the
coffee
flavor
is
it
really
integrates
well
rather
than
dominating
one
of
the
better
coffee
beers
ive
had
if
this
was
available
near
me
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
this
can
13
brought
back
from
msp
all
surly
beers
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
to
date
drink
fast
and
smooth
this
is
no
exception
by
definition
this
is
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
i
could
definitely
enjoy
a
couple
pints
or
three
of
coffee
bender
without
getting
tired
of
it
this
isnt
a
mind
blowing
beer
by
far
but
its
so
intricate
complex
and
interesting
that
its
going
to
be
on
my
wants
list
permanently
along
with
regular
bender
highly
recommended
o
this
was
a
huge
disappointment
for
me
after
having
such
high
hopes
for
it
its
possible
i
just
got
an
old
can
of
it
so
ill
be
seeking
this
out
again
to
give
it
another
shot
and
ill
come
update
this
if
theres
any
difference
d
good
for
a
coffeeinfused
brown
ale
dryness
and
clean
finish
make
it
a
smooth
beer
suitable
for

the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
long
lingering
aftertate
of
coffee
and
dark
grain
bitterness
is
left
on
the
tongue
that
at
times
comes
across
like
chocolate
but
mostly
coffee
it
also
finishes
with
some
citrus
hop
character
and
a
bit
drying
that
makes
you
want
to
sip
this
brew
more
and
more
overall
a
wonderful
brew
being
a
coffee
lover
i
thought
this
beer
was
fantastic
fantastic
brew
all
around
very
balanced
and
one
i
could
surely
even
drink
for
breakfast
d
like
a
mix
of
brown
ale
and
iced
coffee
all
in
all
an
impressive
brown
ale
from
surly
very
unique
and
wellexecuted
received
as
a
extra
from
speedwayjim
what
a
good
guy
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
smelled
like
a
dunkin
doughnuts
hazelnut
iced
coffee
very
impressive
tastes
the
same
i
am
blown
away
how
an
ale
can
taste
like
an
iced
coffee
the
coffee
beans
are
so
rich
and
vivid
and
yet
the
brown
ale
is
still
dominating
and
skillfully
crafted
ive
only
had
the
furious
and
this
offering
and
would
love
to
try
more
from
surly
d
a
great
brown
ale
made
even
more
dynamic
with
the
addition
of
coffee
into
the
mix
a
great
beer
for
the
fall
time
a
great
beer
would
have
this
in
my
fridge
on
the
regular
if
surly
distributed
to
ca
drinkability
good
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
very
amazing
beer
i
really
liked
the
regular
bender
but
the
coffee
bender
is
a
completely
different
beer
amazing
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
on
hand
its
that
good
d
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
if
only
surly
distributed
to
ga
great
melding
of
coffee
and
beer
and
another
great
example
of
an
exciting
brown
ale
at
5
1
abv
this
ones
very
drinkable
dthis
is
a
really
easy
drinking
coffee
beer
and
one
where
the
coffee
component
doesnt
overwhelm
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
overall
it
is
decent
kinda
gives
you
a
stomach
ache
d
good
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
with
the
mix
of
the
coffee
complementing
the
original
bender
so
well
it
made
this
one
hard
to
put
down
poured
a
16oz
can
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
muddy
brown
with
amber
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
massive
4
inch
brown
cap
leaves
mild
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
surly
really
knows
how
to
make
a
pretty
beer
i
stuck
my
nose
down
in
the
glass
for
the
first
whiff
and
bam
a
full
frontal
attack
to
the
olfactory
by
freshly
ground
roasted
with
love
coffee
beans
and
nothing
with
else
even
as
i
let
it
warm
nothing
else
really
comes
through
its
like
the
coffee
has
completely
drowned
out
the
bender
aspect
the
flavor
is
only
slightly
better
fresh
ground
artisan
coffee
the
best
type
of
coffee
you
can
buy
but
thats
really
all
i
get
hints
of
chocolate
come
through
on
the
tail
buy
really
nothing
else
the
coffee
has
overwhelmed
everything
that
makes
this
beer
great
and
turned
it
into
a
one
dimensional
monster
im
not
saying
its
bad
coffee
bender
tastes
like
great
coffee
like
i
could
drink
it
warm
out
of
a
big
mug
in
the
morning
but
its
really
lost
every
other
aspect
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
creamy
leaving
a
little
coffee
astringency
lingering
on
the
palate
i
really
like
the
beer
its
tasty
but
its
one
dimensional
and
not
as
good
as
bender
is
md
could
easily
replace
a
cup
of
coffee
in
the
morning
nearly
no
carbonation
smooth
feel
down
the
throat
when
i
drank
this
i
couldnt
stop
smiling
simply
one
of
the
most
delicious
and
interesting
beers
ive
ever
had
if
i
lived
closer
id
drink
it
regularly
i
expected
big
things
out
of
this
beer
and
wasnt
even
close
to
being
let
down
long
live

very

boy
i
could
drink
this
all
night
very
drinkable
and
nice
to
see
a
coffee
beer
that
is
not
a
porter
or
stout
damn
good
all
around
md
lightmedium
bodied
with
lower
carbonation
easy
drinking
would
have
liked
a
little
more
in
just
about
every
department
from
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
medium
bodied
but
the
carb
is
a
touch
high
for
me
overall
i
love
this
beer
and
would
drink
a
ton
if
i
had
access
to
it
but
its
not
stunning
to
me
more
like
a
well
rounded
and
unique
beer
that
tastes
really
good
dsmooth
and
thin
more
like
a
strong
ale
some
balance
and
a
light
coffee
notes
overall
a
wonderful
beer
that
you
can
easily
enjoy
from
morning
until
night
taste
is
somewhat
acidic
derivative
of
low
quality
unsweetened
coffee
theres
not
enough
malt
to
balance
out
the
raw
nuttiness
it
needs
to
be
a
little
sweeter
and
more
well
rounded
goes
down
a
little
rough
my
absolute
favorite
thing
about
coffee
bender
is
how
it
showcases
the
coffee
flavors
so
well
by
setting
them
against
something
contrasting
its
like
having
complementary
versus
contrasting
flavors
with
a
meal
in
that
one
isnt
necessarily
better
than
the
other
very
tasty
to
drink
cant
wait
till
i
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
yum
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
recommended
d
first
thing
i
want
to
grab
when
i
wake
up
in
the
morning
light
mouthfeel
and
a
strong
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brown
ale
and
as
an
added
bonus
in
a
can
d
very
good
i
could
drink
it
all
night
long
and
be
happy
d
surly
needs
to
get
distribution
here
in
florida
this
stuff
is
great
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
it
had
some
great
flavors
and
the
coffee
really
enhanced
the
overall
flavor
instead
of
taking
it
over
which
was
great
very
enjoyable
beer
md
another
excellent
brew
from
surly
great
blend
of
malts
and
coffee
well
balanced
for
a
twist
on
the
american
brown
ale
style
a
for
sure
must
try
and
comes
highly
recommended
love
to
start
my
mornings
with
a
cup
of
coffee
bender
but
i
dont
think
i
can
have
just
one
toasted
malt
hits
the
palate
first
with
coffee
not
far
behind
the
coffee
character
obliterates
a
lot
of
the
depth
and
subtlety
that
regular
bender
has
but
the
coffee
character
in
itself
displays
a
lot
of
complexity
its
earthy
roasty
lightly
acidic
one
of
the
most
rounded
and
complex
coffee
profiles
ive
detected
in
a
beer
the
finish
has
equal
amounts
of
toast
roast
toffee
and
coffee
it
finishes
coffeeforward
slightly
bitter
and
decidedly
dry
with
a
coffee
grounds
finish
this
is
stellar
up
to
surlys
usual
high
standards
and
pretty
unique
to
boot
overall
a
very
good
coffee
beer
if
coffee
in
your
beer
is
what
you
want
coffee
coffee
coffee
too
coffee
forward
its
not
my
thing
i
kept
the
score
a
little
higher
on
the
flavor
because
though
it
lacked
the
coffee
i
was
expecting
this
still
was
a
damn
good
brown
better
than
many
id
have
another
and
even
another
but
they
could
bold
it
up
a
bit
more
imo
thanks
again
for
the
opportunity
andy
overall
this
was
a
great
coffeeinfused
american
brown
ale
and
another
fine
offering
from
surly
thanks
again
meagan
and
nate
recommended
d
if
you
like
coffee
this
is
very
drinkable
due
to
its
excellent
flavor
and
low
abv
if
you
are
not
a
coffee
drinker
you
probably
wont
drink
more
than
one
if
i
ever
drank
a
beer
in
the
morning
coffee
bender
would
be
my
choice
some
reddish
notes
on
the
edge
the
head
is
creamy
beige
and
quite
dense
the
aroma
presents
notes
of
coffee
with
some
chocolate
the
coffee
aroma
is
typical
of
coffee
grains
the
chocolate
aroma
is
the
one
of
a
dark
chocolate
the
taste
is
like
crunching
on
coffee
beans
that
are
coated
in
dark
chocolate
the
bitterness
is
what
you
usually
found
in
an
espresso
coffee
it
lingers
in
the
mouth
medium
body
with
carbonation
the
head
sticks
well
to
the
glass
a
very
good
beer
for
everyday
not
too
heavy
for
a
beer
and
quite
sessionable
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
expected
mild
carbonation
not
a
favorite
the
body
and
somewhat
simple
flavor
profile
coupled
with
a
low
abv
make
this
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
nice
light
drinkable
coffee
brew
not
my
favorite
by
surly
but
still
a
very
solid
well
put
together
brew
d
a
great
great
beer
surly
hits
a
gold
again
with
this
brew
drinking
this
beer
sincerely
improves
the
quality
of
my
life
i
can
certainly
get
through
a
few
of
these
in
one
session
the
almost
overwhelming
coffee
aspect
of
this
one
cuts
the
drinkability
down
some
compared
to
many
other
coffee
infused
beers
this
one
seems
a
bit
off
balance
theres
a
bit
too
strong
of
a
division
between
the
beer
and
coffee
in
this
beer
d
this
is
very
much
dominated
by
coffee
and
if
that
is
your
thing
then
this
will
not
disappoint
and
hence
will
go
down
very
easilyalmost
too
easily
a
nice
anytime
beer
an
absolute
revelation
walk
no
run
to
acquire
such
a
masterpiece
pours
a
brown
with
ruby
highlights
clear
enough
to
see
through
off
white
bubbly
head
the
smell
i
recognize
initially
is
that
fresh
brewed
cold
coffee
smell
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
similar
yet
slightly
different
roasted
note
coming
from
the
malts
as
the
beer
wears
on
the
chocolate
becomes
more
apparent
in
the
nose
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
nice
chocolatey
sweetness
but
finishes
roasty
bitter
the
taste
of
actual
coffee
is
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
the
brew
is
on
the
thinner
side
maybe
evening
having
a
watery
aspect
despite
its
robust
flavor
overall
this
takes
the
cake
for
coffee
influenced
beer
styles
besides
dfh
india
brown
ale
its
up
there
as
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
tasted
kudos
to
surly
for
an
awesome
brew

d
if
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thicker
this
would
be
pretty
close
to
a
perfect
brown
the
way
it
stands
its
still
very
good
and
i
could
go
through
a
number
of
these
with
no
problem
man
do
i
love
surly
brews
mouthfeeldrinkability
well
carbonated
and
its
got
a
nice
body
to
it
its
very
smooth
and
very
soothing
i
could
sip
on
this
all
night
i
was
really
anticipating
this
one
and
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
i
could
drink
this
one
for
days
if
it
was
more
readily
available
in
my
area
this
would
turn
into
my
session
beer
like
i
said
its
like
a
stout
light
all
the
taste
half
the
alcohol
dont
know
the
algorithm
for
ratings
but
this
should
be
getting
an
a
from
me
d
quite
the
unique
one
here
drinks
more
like
an
alcoholic
coffee
energy
drink
than
anything
else
i
am
a
huge
coffeehead
so
i
find
this
rather
enjoyable
just
missing
the
wellroundedness
of
classic
coffee
beer
flavors
d
this
beer
is
like
eating
chocolate
covered
espresso
beans
and
the
hops
let
you
know
that
there
is
a
great
beer
base
underneath
delicious
i
have
to
be
honest
i
was
not
sure
how
i
would
feel
about
this
beer
i
have
been
a
surly
fan
for
a
while
now
and
still
was
somewhat
reluctant
well
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
that
they
know
exactly
what
they
are
doing
mediumfull
body
plush
carbonation
this
beer
like
everything
else
ive
tried
from
surly
thus
far
is
an
absolute
joy
to
drink
cant
wait
to
try
furious
next
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
a
fairly
nice
feel
as
it
roles
across
the
palate
not
too
carbonated
the
flavor
has
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
is
quickly
taken
over
by
the
flavor
of
coffee
bitter
as
the
beer
exits
this
has
some
nice
flavor
the
amazing
thing
about
it
is
that
it
has
a
strong
truly
coffeelike
flavor
but
it
does
not
become
overwhelmingmaking
this
a
drinkable
brew
cardboard
box
lovers
may
love
this
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
coffee
beers
i
have
had
and
is
a
nice
change
from
the
typical
coffee
stout
coffee
bender
is
a
bit
lighter
than
most
coffee
beers
you
typically
come
across
but
still
packs
a
lot
of
coffee
flavor
i
wish
this
was
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
on
the
east
coast
definitely
worth
grabbing
a
four
pack
of
or
more
all
in
all
this
one
is
good
if
youre
a
coffee
drinker
as
i
am
then
you
will
love
this
brew
its
one
of
the
only
beers
i
can
picture
having
during
breakfast
haha
very
much
like
drinking
a
coffee
tasty
d
this
beer
i
would
get
into
trouble
drinking
all
the
time
i
had
no
problem
drinking
all
of
it
in
a
quick
fashion
i
will
be
looking
to
get
more
of
this
as
soon
as
i
can
coffee
drinkers
and
coffee
beer
fans
should
do
all
they
can
to
try
this
out
d
i
definitely
would
like
access
to
this
more
often
too
bad
it
is
only
available
in
minnesota
would
like
to
try
more
of
surlys
beer
d
fantastic
coffee
beer
this
one
really
just
tastes
like
a
cup
of
coffee
and
is
just
so
easy
to
drink
especially
with
the
lower
abv
pours
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
straight
coffee
with
nothing
else
coming
through
the
flavor
is
coffee
with
some
roasted
malts
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
at
the
end
either
from
the
coffee
or
from
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
one
of
the
best
most
interesting
brown
ales
i
have
tried
drinkability
nice
fairly
easy
to
drink
coffee
ale
but
i
prefer
the
complexity
of
the
standard
bender
also
not
quite
in
the
same
league
as
founders
breakfast
stout
and
bells
java
stout
but
very
good
nonetheless
it
pours
a
semi
transparent
brown
cola
color
with
minimal
tan
head
the
smell
is
just
smooth
black
coffee
not
ra
lot
of
roastiness
and
no
detectable
bitterness
like
an
ice
coffee
made
from
a
french
press
really
pleasing
and
inviting
the
taste
is
just
the
same
i
think
ive
had
french
press
ice
coffee
that
tastes
just
like
this
there
is
very
little
beer
character
in
here
which
i
think
is
what
the
brewer
has
intended
i
havent
had
the
base
beer
but
now
im
wishing
i
picked
up
some
so
i
could
compare
the
absence
of
bitterness
and
high
roastiness
is
what
makes
this
beer
unique
and
one
of
my
favorite
coffee
flavored
beers
i
could
put
this
in
the
office
coffee
pot
and
i
doubt
no
one
would
be
the
wiser
although
the
day
would
be
more
interesting
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
but
that
is
my
only
complaint
im
sad
i
only
picked
up
a
4pack
of
this
from
my
mn
trip
d
the
can
really
doesnt
like
about
this
one
it
really
tastes
just
like
an
iced
coffee
i
liked
the
creamy
coffee
taste
it
gave
off
and
the
smell
is
one
of
straight
coffee
definitely
look
forward
to
getting
more
of
this
stuff
roasted
iced
coffee
and
bender
mix
balance
leans
towards
the
coffee
becomes
more
balanced
as
it
progresses
im
thinking
that
this
could
have
replaced
one
of
my
weekend
morning
coffees
certainly
one
for
coffee
and
of
course
beerlovers
to
try
d
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
damn
the
beer
gods
for
teasing
me
with
this
truly
though
this
is
a
great
beer
not
filling
beyond
tasty
if
it
were
distributed
to
me
it
would
most
definitely
be
my
go
to
beer
d
honestly
i
could
drink
this
with
breakfast
lunch
andor
dinner
this
is
refreshing
iced
coffee
beer
if
you
like
coffee
and
beer
this
is
your
session
beer
d
this
beer
tastes
good
and
goes
down
smoothly
if
i
were
tailgating
i
would
start
the
morning
off
with
this
one
the
abv
is
high
so
it
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
too
bad
you
can
only
get
this
in
minnesota
another
good
beer
from
surly
d
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
with
a
great
coffee
taste
im
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
one
dvery
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
with
a
big
bold
flavour
slightly
over
sessionable
i
still
could
make
one
out
of
it
if
this
was
in
my
area
i
would
always
have
it
on
hand
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
the
coffeeflavored
beer
segment
this
is
an
excellent
darker
but
milder
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
an
entire
evening
d
if
you
like
coffee
amazing
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
unfortunately
i
didnt
really
get
to
experience
it
warm
up
a
lot
because
it
went
down
so
fast
a
really
good
beer
i
wish
we
had
surly
in
michigan
i
would
always
keep
some
in
my
disc
golf
bag
solid
black
body
with
a
one
finger
khaki
head
solid
lacing
initially
nose
is
a
chocolate
milk
shake
from
two
feet
away
or
hot
coco
i
want
to
warm
this
up
dramatically
taste
isnt
as
bitter
coffee
as
i
was
thinking
from
advertisement
more
of
a
bitter
sweet
chocolate
almost
a
metallic
sting
in
the
taste
too
bitters
come
out
more
in
the
finish
too
this
is
one
brew
that
could
probably
easily
work
with
more
alcohol
in
it
the
flavors
are
interesting
and
strong
enough
to
conceal
more
than
is
in
it
i
dont
think
ive
ever
said
that
about
a
beer
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
mouth
is
probably
a
bit
too
bubbly
or
fizzy
for
me
but
over
all
a
sold
coffee
brown
ale
almost
completely
solid
lacing
to
the
end
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
brew
didnt
wash
over
d
high
drinkability
i
would
be
happy
to
sub
out
my
morning
coffee
for
this
overall
an
excellent
example
of
coffee
flavors
and
aroma
adding
to
the
complexity
of
the
beer
the
bitterness
coming
off
the
coffee
marries
well
with
the
hop
and
roasted
barley
qualities
in
this
beer
i
feel
like
im
saying
it
all
the
time
lately
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
it
moves
toward
watery
in
the
end
but
i
suppose
this
leads
to
a
crisp
and
clean
finish
this
is
damn
good
much
better
than
i
remember
it
last
time
i
had
it
a
nice
touch
of
sweetness
really
rounds
this
out
if
you
like
coffee
you
will
love
this
purchased
from
blue
max
liquors
in
burnsville
mn
pours
a
black
body
with
ruby
red
corners
and
a
big
pillowy
tan
head
aroma
is
mostly
coffee
beans
and
also
some
chocolate
and
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
flavor
is
tinny
grainy
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
good
coffee
flavor
and
bitterness
from
the
coffee
which
also
intermingles
with
the
hop
bitterness
the
relatively
low
alcohol
content
is
a
nice
touch
since
this
is
so
tastey
that
i
had
to
grab
a
second
one
d
superb
a
sort
of
cousin
to
peak
organic
espresso
amber
sometimes
its
nice
to
have
a
coffee
beer
without
roasted
malt
and
a
huge
body
definitely
worth
a
try
as
it
warmed
up
i
got
a
better
taste
of
the
brown
ale
and
the
malt
really
started
to
balance
out
the
coffee
and
enhance
the
smell
this
is
nearly
sessionable
at
around
5
d
very
highly
drinkable
this
is
one
of
those
standby
goto
beers
that
i
feel
like
i
want
to
be
able
to
have
at
all
times
great
light
body
good
character
and
super
tasty
i
enjoy
trying
nonstout
coffee
beers
and
i
like
the
base
beer
bender
so
i
have
high
hopes
for
this
appearance
wise
everything
is
as
expected
looking
similar
to
bender
dark
browns
relatively
clear
frothy
mocha
head
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
also
very
nice
a
strong
malty
nutty
base
with
what
smells
like
fresh
coffee
beans
not
overly
sweet
but
not
bitter
either
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
is
where
i
miss
the
original
bender
or
some
of
the
bigger
coffee
stout
beers
not
to
say
this
isnt
well
made
or
enjoyable
but
i
feel
like
its
splitting
the
difference
between
the
two
without
hitting
the
peaks
of
flavor
or
mouthfeel
from
bender
or
something
like
breakfast
stout
unlike
the
stouts
the
body
is
less
chewy
and
full
but
still
a
robust
mediumfull
the
most
disappointing
part
of
the
beer
is
the
finish
which
has
a
nutty
dry
bender
like
flavor
but
is
overall
rather
thin
and
has
a
watery
character
the
body
has
a
nice
fresh
brewed
coffee
characteristic
with
mild
malt
and
nutty
background
but
not
much
sweetness
or
roasted
flavors
overall
a
very
drinkable
enjoyable
coffee
beer
but
i
dont
feel
like
the
coffee
adds
that
much
to
the
original
base
beer
nor
does
it
satisfy
me
if
im
looking
for
an
intense
coffee
infused
beer
fix
great
beer
overall
and
yet
another
star
in
surlys
lineup
drinkability
keep
em
coming
this
is
a
delicious
delicious
brew
and
i
am
pleased
to
have
picked
up
a
4pack
this
is
one
tasty
and
sessionable
coffee
brown
from
surly
reviewed
on
12162009
023550
the
beer
is
lighttomedium
bodied
crisp
and
well
carbonated
the
low
abv
makes
this
something
i
could
multiple
cans
of
over
a
long
day
the
can
claims
the
beer
is
as
refreshing
as
an
iced
coffee
and
they
arent
far
off
another
good
beer
from
surly
d
a
great
coffee
beer
despite
its
lack
of
depth
one
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
again
coffee
is
the
dominant
flavor
here
overall
smooth
and
medium
bodied
beer
a
lot
of
sweetness
in
this
beer
kind
of
tastes
like
a
coffee
beer
interesting
second
taste
there
is
a
slight
roasty
aftertaste
with
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
the
sweetness
and
coffee
add
a
lot
to
the
connectivity
of
this
beer
and
normally
im
not
a
big
coffee
beer
guy
but
this
was
great
drinkability
high
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
though
we
are
entering
a
season
in
michigan
where
i
prefer
my
coffee
piping
hot
it
is
wonderful
to
enjoy
a
coffee
beverage
from
the
warm
comforts
of
my
home
goes
down
remarkably
easy
it
will
take
some
will
power
to
hold
on
to
the
rest
of
my
stash
for
very
long
thank
you
to
mothman
for
providing
this
wonderful
opportunity
d
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
coffee
bender
and
from
everything
ive
had
from
the
surly
brewing
company
thus
far
this
brew
along
with
the
furious
puts
surly
in
my
top
5
favorite
breweries
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
friend
any
day
ive
gained
much
respect
for
surly
after
trying
furious
cynicale
bender
darkness
and
coffee
bender
they
are
not
mindless
hoppackers
but
can
brew
a
well
rounded
beer
that
is
worth
the
hype
o
this
is
my
new
favorite
everyday
beer
light
enough
to
drink
solo
on
a
hot
day
like
an
iced
coffee
but
a
flavor
profile
that
goes
great
with
a
dog
or
a
burger
and
still
manages
to
satisfy
on
a
cold
december
night
in
minnesota
a
really
good
coffee
infused
brown
ale
something
i
would
recommend
and
wish
i
could
get
more
of
drinkability
a
fine
session
beer
at
the
top
of
the
list
for
an
american
brown
thanks
to
mpls
and
skydoc
for
setting
me
up
with
some
of
these
gems
at
dld09
more
is
better
an
ok
beer
but
not
a
complicated
one
an
ok
sample
but
not
a
mainstay
beer
d
overall
great
easy
smooth
drink
abv
is
low
so
no
issues
there
cant
wait
to
have
the
others
that
i
got
the
beer
felt
quite
nice
with
low
carbonation
and
could
easily
be
drunk
quite
regularly
i
really
love
that
there
is
a
coffee
beer
that
is
so
drinkable
and
sessionable
so
often
coffee
is
added
to
beers
that
are
already
huge
stouts
and
that
makes
them
by
default
oneanddone
or
bottles
to
share
with
friends
thats
what
makes
this
brown
ale
so
nice
now
i
just
need
to
trade
for
more
the
taste
is
a
bit
less
complex
than
the
smell
here
coffee
takes
an
unambiguous
lead
the
sugar
and
bread
flavors
that
were
promised
by
the
smell
are
there
but
they
play
a
background
role
tasting
blind
id
be
hardpressed
to
differentiate
this
from
an
above
average
coffee
stout
except
perhaps
for
the
lighter
mouthfeel
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
coffee
flavors
in
beer
and
its
presence
here
is
appreciated
the
problem
is
that
none
of
the
other
flavors
that
make
a
brown
ale
are
allowed
to
shine
this
is
a
tough
one
for
me
i
love
the
flavors
but
they
dont
belong
in
this
setting
im
rating
this
one
to
style
but
if
you
love
coffee
as
i
do
bump
it
up
a
notch
or
two
pored
very
dark
brown
with
thin
beige
ring
with
little
head
it
did
have
some
nice
sticky
lacing
smell
was
all
coffee
and
some
vanilla
some
burnt
malts
the
taste
was
coffee
first
strong
coffee
it
overwhelmed
the
bender
with
roasted
somewhat
bitter
taste
the
malts
and
the
hops
could
not
be
detected
overall
i
did
not
enjoy
this
one
like
say
peruvian
morning
it
was
not
balanced
between
malt
hops
and
coffee
ill
stick
to
plain
bender
for
my
brown
ale
fix
again
surly
comes
through
with
another
great
beer
and
quickly
becoming
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
brewery
d
its
not
hard
to
drink
but
its
just
not
particularly
pleasant
either
not
going
to
do
much
of
this
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
lasting
but
because
of
its
blandness
its
not
very
drinkable
not
because
its
filing
but
because
its
just
bland
d
and
overall
impression
i
am
a
coffee
lover
so
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
one
tasty
brew
i
think
i
like
ccbs
espresso
maduro
a
little
better
but
if
i
had
access
to
this
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
skal
d
great
coffeeinfused
beer
with
a
lot
of
earthy
hop
character
im
glad
to
have
finally
reviewed
this
one
thanks
kramer
d
a
great
coffee
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
expresses
what
coffee
beers
should
taste
like
the
best
part
of
waking
up
is
surly
in
my
cup
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
small
lingering
brown
head
smelled
of
coffee
roastiness
mocha
and
light
vanilla
tasted
of
coffee
roastiness
and
light
cocoa
with
a
lingering
coffee
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
finish
good
complex
brew
deep
brown
body
topped
by
a
thick
tan
head
head
throws
a
lot
of
nice
lace
aroma
has
a
strong
fresh
ground
coffee
note
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
vanilla
flavor
is
also
very
strong
on
the
coffee
like
a
nice
mild
roast
supported
by
caramel
malts
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
tends
to
support
the
whole
coffee
vibe
drinkability
is
good
i
would
want
another
someday
but
not
immediately
following
a
very
enjoyable
coffee
beer
might
wake
up
with
one
of
these
tomorrow
an
interesting
and
craveable
brew
if
you
enjoyed
this
give
furthermores
coffee
beer
a
try
which
this
reminded
me
of
this
dark
brown
brew
foams
up
big
with
a
tan
head
looks
nice
the
aroma
is
wondeeful
rich
malt
with
sharp
espresso
scent
the
coffee
flavor
is
integrated
perfectly
in
this
highly
drinkable
brew
i
love
that
the
coffee
flavor
comes
in
a
session
beer
since
you
can
watto
keep
drinking
this
stuff
very
well
done
i
want
to
call
this
brew
complex
but
it
really
is
straight
forward
and
to
the
point
this
is
definitely
something
every
beer
drinker
must
try
you
will
not
regret
it
thanks
again
drizzam
final
thoughts
yes
this
is
much
more
beer
than
coffee
unlike
most
of
the
other
coffee
beers
and
its
blended
really
well
with
the
roasted
malts
coffee
and
good
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
pretty
bitter
and
tastes
great
cant
wait
to
have
another
sip
pours
a
very
deep
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
good
sized
tan
bubbly
head
the
smell
on
this
beer
is
coffee
there
are
some
other
things
going
on
as
well
but
mainly
coffee
taste
is
like
the
smell
coffee
hops
are
present
as
well
as
a
cocoa
flavor
goes
down
smooth
and
viscous
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
could
probably
drink
a
billion
of
these
although
i
am
also
a
coffee
lover
if
you
like
coffee
you
will
love
this
beer
if
not
you
wont
simple
as
that
poured
a
deep
brown
with
great
caronation
and
big
tannish
head
nose
is
big
coffee
beans
and
very
yummy
taste
is
a
good
it
has
one
of
the
best
tasting
coffee
flavors
i
have
experienced
it
tastes
like
fresh
natural
coffee
beans
more
so
than
any
beer
i
have
had
very
smooth
not
over
the
top
also
has
some
oats
and
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
thinner
but
the
fresh
coffee
roams
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
for
an
american
brown
and
really
light
for
an
american
coffee
beer
light
carbonation
fits
just
right
in
this
beer
id
love
to
try
this
one
again
shouts
to
ineedabeerhere
for
the
can
d
good
drinkability
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
session
beer
the
caffiene
gets
to
me
after
one
can
kinda
fun
actually
great
beer
drinkability
this
beer
has
some
outstanding
drinkability
its
refreshing
smooth
not
overly
heavy
and
most
importantly
very
tasty
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
bad
boy
its
a
shame
this
is
my
only
can
overall
probably
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
had
very
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
highly
recommended
for
a
session
beer
dark
chocolate
molasses
brown

great

up

notes
finish
is
coffee
bitter
with
lingering
caramel
mediumbodied
with
a
slightly
oily
feel
delicious
d
a
very
nice
if
not
unique
brew
that
anyone
who
enjoys
a
little
coffee
in
their
beer
should
take
a
chance
on
there
is
a
reason
why
coffee
bender
and
its
kid
brother
bender
rock
the
top
of
the
american
brown
ale
charts
they
are
that
good
this
is
one
of
the
best
coffee
beers
ive
had
and
equal
kudos
go
to
surly
and
the
roaster
the
result
is
a
coffeefocused
beer
that
is
harmonized
with
the
beans
it
is
juiced
with
d
the
coffee
is
a
bit
overwhelming
for
too
many
but
the
can
my
wife
and
i
shared
was
gone
rather
quickly
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
the
nose
is
just
out
of
this
world
on
the
whole
i
think
i
like
the
original
bender
better
but
this
would
be
a
wonderful
change
of
pace
to
mix
it
up
every
now
and
then
if
the
sweet
malts
came
out
a
bit
more
i
think
it
would
be
truly
superb
still
a
great
beer
thanks
again
to
dansting
for
this
one
16oz
can
served
in
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
nice
aroma
of
coffee
and
cocoa
coffee
flavor
was
restrained
and
not
over
the
top
like
a
lot
of
coffee
beers
the
coffee
didnt
add
to
the
bitterness
which
i
find
distracting
decent
amount
of
hop
bitterness
chocolate
malt
dry
finish
from
hops
as
well
as
lingering
malt
one
of
the
better
coffee
beers
imo
who
would
win
a
bender
or
a
certain
coach
ditka
what
if
the
benders
name
was
coffee
bender
very
high
on
the
drinkability
for
me
i
have
been
trying
to
decide
whether
its
a
beer
best
in
summer
or
winter
months
early
in
the
morning
or
at
night
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
can
do
the
job
almost
anytime
i
desire
a
good
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
coffee
beers
peche
mortel
and
valdez
are
two
of
favorites
just
didnt
think
this
one
quite
lived
up
to
it
its
halla
good
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
heavy
smell
of
coffee
here
reminds
me
of
a
few
of
the
local
midnight
sun
coffee
brews
msbc
brewtality
has
sort
of
ruined
me
for
other
coffee
beers
but
this
one
pours
up
nicely
tastes
of
strong
dark
black
coffee
i
dont
get
much
of
a
heavy
beer
taste
the
alcohol
is
very
underlying
for
me
and
it
smacks
more
of
an
iced
coffee
drink
without
any
kind
of
cream
or
milk
goes
down
very
smooth
and
as
one
who
really
likes
coffee
beers
and
big
brews
this
one
is
a
good
addition
to
my
regular
quaff
list
ill
be
trying
this
one
again
for
sure
drinkability
its
good
and
i
will
definitely
have
another
but
not
for
session
drinking
due
to
its
strong
flavors
its
a
delicious
oneanddone
brew
another
creative
and
interesting
brew
from
the
excellent
brewmasters
at
surly
medium
bodied
silky
smooth
and
ultimately
refreshing
a
solid
coffeeinfused
beer
and
a
stellar
brown
overall
only
downside
is
the
price
and
the
way
furthermore
oscura
hits
the
same
spot
its
a
bit
easier
on
the
wallet
to
throw
down
for
the
local
wisco
brew
but
i
would
still
trade
up
for
this
any
day
really
easy
to
drink
refreshing
but
coffee
dominates
i
am
not
a
coffee
drinker
but
this
is
actually
pretty
good
i
could
even
do
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
overall
they
went
too
far
with
the
coffee
cheers
drinkability
while
the
beer
is
certainly
enjoyable
i
cant
help
but
believe
that
the
coffee
overwhelms
some
of
the
more
interesting
aspects
of
bender
a
top
tier
beer
from
a
top
tier
brewery
always
jump
at
the
chance
to
have
one
of
these
the
weak
body
certainly
wouldnt
keep
me
from
drinking
this
one
alot
damn
i
wish
surly
had
better
distribution
nicely
drinkable
oveall
for
me
the
coffee
is
just
too
much
i
cant
taste
much
else
past
it
my
prefence
would
be
more
subtle
coffee
aromasflavors
that
better
blend
wthe
brown
ale
but
just
mho
overall
if
i
could
only
have
beer
in
cans
i
could
survive
off
this
and
ten
fidy
a
truly
excellent
beer
pity
i
dont
have
regular
access
to
it
can
courtesy
photomike
pours
a
clear
ruby
brownish
copper
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
not
exactly
a
brown
brown
ale
aroma
is
straight
up
coffee
grounds
i
wish
i
could
say
more
but
thats
pretty
much
it
flavor
is
iced
coffee
with
half
and
half
slightly
green
coffee
beans
with
light
acidity
and
moderate
astringency
body
and
mouthfeel
are
otherwise
fine
and
if
you
like
coffee
beer
this
is
pretty
much
the
definition
of
it
for
all
its
merits
the
acrid
finish
really
turns
me
off
what
is
otherwise
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
becomes
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
finish
and
while
i
give
it
largely
positive
scores
for
the
rest
of
its
character
i
cant
help
wishing
i
just
had
a
glass
of
regular
ole
bender
here
instead
a
very
interesting
brown
ale
indeed
nice
to
see
that
there
are
now
more
and
more
good
beers
available
on
can
thanks
jctribe25
flat
out
great
beer
not
quite
on
par
with
fbs
but
damn
close
drinkable
you
betcha
this
cupajoe
is
easily
in
the
upper
echelon
of
coffee
beers
central
waters
coffee
stout
founders
breakfast
stout
and
bells
java
stout
are
its
only
peers
pert
near
sessionable
which
few
coffee
beers
can
claim
ng
coffee
stout
overall
this
was
an
excellent
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
first
surly
and
i
now
understand
why
people
love
them
so
much
not
quite
a
peche
or
a
kbs
but
dang
this
is
pretty
good
i
would
very
much
recommend
everyone
try
this
beer
especially
if
you
are
a
regular
coffee
drinker
like
myself
thanks
to
dyan
for
tossing
this
my
way
poured
from
a
16
ounce
can
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
chestnut
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
creamy
ecru
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
of
medium
roasted
grains
caramel
mocha
coffee
toasted
bread
pleasantly
bitter
earthy
and
fruity
hops
great
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
nice
mouthfeel
for
the
style
with
light
to
medium
carbonation
a
wonderfully
sessionable
brown
ale
thanks
again
dyan
this
is
the
first
craft
beer
that
i
have
had
from
a
can
and
i
was
interested
in
how
that
might
alter
or
affect
the
taste
as
far
as
i
can
tell
there
is
no
difference
from
bottled
beer
this
is
a
decent
offering
but
not
something
that
i
would
get
again
jeff
sent
me
various
stuff
from
surly
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
out
the
other
stuff
i
am
sure
they
will
be
solid
beers
just
like
this
one
was
d
quite
drinkable
despite
being
a
very
dark
coffee
beer
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
from
surly
this
beer
has
pre
set
high
expectations
as
i
had
sampled
it
from
a
growler
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
loved
it
pours
to
the
darkest
blackish
brown
body
head
is
a
biscuit
like
tan
tone
and
considerably
rocky
standing
at
nearly
three
fingers
tons
of
wavy
lace
is
left
as
it
very
slowly
fades
coffee
is
immediately
evidant
on
the
nose
like
cold
but
fresh
coffee
i
love
the
nose
on
this
one
coffee
comes
first
and
quick
with
the
initial
sip
but
quickly
yields
a
bitter
dryness
as
it
slides
back
malt
profile
is
mineral
based
and
adds
a
slight
sweet
feel
for
just
the
right
amount
of
balance
refreshing
yet
bold
and
truely
enjoyable
all
around
mouthfeel
is
so
attractive
and
really
beckons
the
next
sip
true
drinkability
that
is
hard
to
beat
di
could
drink
this
all
morning
all
afternoon
and
all
night
so
easy
going
down
and
so
drinkable
very
easy
to
drink
the
coffee
makes
this
brew
seem
so
dark
to
look
at
but
its
certainly
nice
to
realize
that
it
isnt
too
heavy
or
overly
filling
upon
drinking
maybe
thats
why
they
went
with
a
brown
ale
rather
than
a
stout
for
this
coffee
beer
but
whatever
their
reasons
were
kudos
to
them
for
making
this
delicious
concoction
very
good
overall
and
very
easy
to
drink
excellent
flavor
and
a
healthy
5

abv
means
you
can
have
more
than
one
in
a
night
looking
forward
to
more
of
these
pours
like
an
iced
coffee
clear
with
a
big
foamy
light
tan
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
belgian
lacing
behind
the
smell
on
the
timid
side
but
classic
lightly
roasted
malt
and
caramel
topped
off
with
coffee
i
really
appreciate
the
big
mouth
feel
on
this
one
it
works
really
well
with
the
malt
and
coffee
flavors
its
very
smooth
and
creamy
finishes
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
light
coffee
note
that
lingers
nicely
i
also
appreciate
that
the
roasted
character
isnt
over
done
its
been
a
while
since
i
sampled
bender
but
i
think
that
i
prefer
this
one
over
the
original
at
5
1
abv
i
recommend
that
you
fill
your
coffee
station
at
work
with
this
stuff
if
you
can
get
it
hell
of
a
drinker
had
a
lot
of
fun
considering
it
many
thanks
to
maximum12
for
this
opportunity
d
the
roasty
bitterness
takes
this
down
a
notch
for
me
but
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
that
seems
to
be
exactly
what
surly
was
going
for
with
this
coffee
flavored
beer
easy
to
drink
and
no
alcohol
picked
up
in
the
flavor
d
pretty
high
id
like
to
try
the
regular
bender
if
not
get
more
of
this
the
most
enjoyable
coffee
beer
ive
had
i
could
drink
these
for
breakfast
draft
pours
brown
with
a
small
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
light
coffee
grounds
flavor
is
sweet
initially
with
a
coffee
ground
finish
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
stronger
malt
backbone
to
balance
out
the
bitter
coffee
but
perhaps
that
is
expected
when
using
a
brown
ale
as
the
base
instead
of
a
porter
or
stout
which
i
am
more
used
to
anyway
it
was
very
good
for
a
brown
ale
d
very
easy
drinking
the
coffee
flavor
is
a
bit
direct
after
a
full
can
reducing
the
drinkability
for
me
not
filling
nor
overly
abusive
in
terms
of
abv
the
drinkability
is
very
good
considering
coffee
is
such
a
strong
flavor
this
beer
would
be
appropriate
in
many
circumstances
whether
sessioned
on
a
cold
minnesota
winter
night
or
even
at
a
cook
out
d
good
stuff
here
mouthfeel
and
taste
keeps
this
one
going
surly
is
the
real
deal
cheers
danother
rock
solid
brew
from
surly
and
one
that
i
would
surely
drink
a
lot
of
if
it
was
available

thanks
again
for
this
surly
brew
poured
into
my
hangar
24
pint
glass
tonight
color
was
a
dark
brown
34
inch
off
white
creamy
head
that
lasts
a
few
minutes
minimal
lacing
aroma
consists
of
coffee
beans
mild
vanilla
roasted
nuts
sweet
malts
caramel
and
grains
flavor
starts
off
with
a
dry
coffee
taste
nutty
in
the
middle
with
some
sweetness
lingering
right
afterwards
stays
the
same
as
it
warms
but
gets
easier
to
drink
like
how
the
coffee
dries
out
this
great
brown
ale
dry
slightly
chewy
and
malty
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
taste
lingers
moderate
carbonation
could
drink
a
few
cans
of
this
no
problem
smooth
and
light
for
what
it
is
coffee
is
not
overpowering
hit
the
spot
tonight
would
like
to
drink
again
recommended
drinkaility
give
me
a
cup
of
coffee
one
cup
and
im
done
well
made
coffee
inspired
beers
seem
to
defy
any
sensible
reasoning
given
my
stand
on
coffee
as
i
find
them
very
damn
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
coffee
brews
to
quaff
nuff
said
d
this
is
a
damned
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
easily
kill
3
of
these
if
i
was
in
a
coffee
mood
but
i
would
have
to
want
coffee
this
is
straight
up
a
good
iced
coffee
type
flavor
and
it
mirrors
an
iced
coffee
almost
perfectly
like
i
said
on
the
flavor
not
exactly
the
most
dynamic
of
beers
but
it
all
works
greatly
together
and
creates
an
amazing
beer
flavor
is
spot
on
and
very
enjoyable
i
could
easily
drink
this
at
any
time
of
day
morning
noon
or
night
fantastic
thanks
andy
d
extremely
easy
drinking
i
might
be
able
to
have
this
one
for
breakfast
instead
of
the
morning
coffee
alcohol
is
not
detectible
if
you
like
coffee
you
could
have
this
one
all
day
long
drinkability
while
brown
ales
really
generally
arent
my
favorite
this
one
was
very
very
good
the
coffee
worked
with
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
spectacularly
i
could
easily
put
down
a
few
of
these
and
would
definitely
pick
it
up
against
if
it
was
more
accessible
to
me
or
accessible
at
all
very
dark
brown
to
black
in
color
some
light
passes
through
to
create
brown
spots
thick
frothy
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
as
the
head
settles
down
the
head
has
a
tannish
color
to
it
nice
coffee
nose
that
is
like
sniffing
coffee
beans
i
call
it
good
but
cant
be
exceptional
because
its
more
coffee
than
beer
it
seems
like
nitpicking
gentle
malt
attack
and
coffee
notes
throughout
a
little
smoky
at
the
finish
due
to
the
presence
of
the
coffee
very
much
reminiscent
of
a
dunkin
donuts
iced
coffee
flavor
to
this
beer
i
havent
had
dunkin
donuts
in
a
while
since
they
arent
prevalent
in
the
twin
cities
but
its
how
i
remember
it
some
mild
bitters
on
the
surface
of
the
flavor
the
coffee
tones
are
gently
interwoven
into
the
beer
but
they
are
definitely
the
dominant
flavor
coffee
in
the
title
is
right
it
seems
this
should
do
well
locally
when
you
consider
all
of
the
coffee
shops
maybe
they
should
ship
some
to
seattle
for
sale
too
different
and
worth
a
drink
i
can
see
some
purists
turning
their
noses
up
at
it
however
d
a
very
good
solid
brew
that
is
really
easy
to
drink
d
still
quite
drinkable
and
tasty
i
just
drank
my
first
bender
about
30
minutes
ago
and
adding
coffee
to
it
certainly
works
well
the
impressive
thing
is
that
they
pack
so
much
flavor
into
a
lower
abv
lighter
bodied
brown
ale
this
beer
isnt
as
drinkable
as
some
because
the
high
level
of
bitterness
i
would
not
want
more
than
two
of
these
large
cans
in
a
sitting
i
did
enjoy
the
beer
and
would
love
more
in
the
future
great
brew
d
its
alright
but
not
a
knockout
like
some
of
the
surly
brews
cheers

a
dark
brown
with
a
silky
tan
head
excellent
lacing
nose
has
coffee
chocolate
roasted
nuts
and
bready
malts
taste
has
more
rosted
malts
and
sweet
coffee
beans
up
front
followed
by
cocao
molasses
a
hint
of
hops
and
earthy
cocoa
with
bitter
espresso
through
the
finish
nice
creamy
body
is
well
carbonated
good
to
see
another
quality
beer
in
a
can
looks
just
like
regular
bender
except
just
a
bit
lighter
thin
head
that
has
decent
retention
some
nice
lacing
smells
a
whole
lot
better
though
instead
of
just
some
sweet
malt
lots
of
awesome
coffee
smell
tastes
just
like
an
iced
coffee
strong
coffee
flavor
without
being
overbearing
also
helps
to
balance
out
the
hops
perfectly
carbonated
lingering
on
the
palate
great
mouthfeel
and
an
amazingly
drinkable
beer
as
it
warms
like
bender
but
better
a
great
beer
taste
is
akin
to
having
your
cup
of
coffee
in
the
morning
bitter
roasting
coffee
a
slight
sweet
smoothness
in
the
body
just
the
hint
of
roasting
malts
again
more
folgers
coffee
than
premium
but
still
amazingly
tasty
a
faint
herbaceous
hop
quality
in
the
finish
that
leaves
a
slightly
dry
finish
smooth
mouthfeel
amazing
drinkability
at
such
a
low
abv
this
is
a
coffee
lovers
session
beer
and
i
wish
it
was
available
a
little
easier
really
nice
if
coffee
bender
was
available
in
new
jersey
i
would
buy
it
frequently
do
you
hear
me
surly
this
is
an
eyeopening
brew
in
more
ways
than
one
a
winner
highly
recommended
d
quite
drinkable
would
love
to
drink
this
with
a
slice
of
good
cheesecake
excellent
job
drinks
pretty
easy
for
all
the
flavor
this
is
throwing
out
not
a
huge
coffee
beer
fan
but
i
love
this
believe
this
is
the
bench
mark
for
coffee
brews
another
winner
from
surly
drinkability
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
another
solid
offering
from
surly
a
nice
concept
but
its
not
for
me
the
stale
coffee
was
not
a
desirable
characteristic
in
my
opinion
this
is
my
birthday
review
yeah
me
yeah
beer
to
me
your
average
brown
isnt
the
easiest
drinking
thing
in
the
world
but
this
is
not
average
by
any
means
very
solid
a
little
brighter
than
usual
for
style
from
the
nice
tangy
hop
bite
im
very
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
although
im
not
sure
if
it
should
be
considered
a
true
american
brown
it
really
seems
more
like
coffee
with
alcohol
than
beer
but
still
delicious
drinkability
definitely
would
drink
this
beer
again
coffee
and
beer
great
combination
overall
a
different
take
on
the
style
that
does
work
im
not
a
huge
brown
ale
guy
but
i
enjoyed
this
can
the
mocha
notes
in
this
seemed
a
limited
more
muted
than
when
i
had
previously
had
this
from
a
growler
allowing
more
of
the
brown
ale
qualaties
to
come
out
never
the
less
this
is
still
a
great
coffee
fix
complete
with
an
awesome
feel
and
super
easy
drinkibility
glad
this
one
is
in
cans
now
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
truly
a
treat
if
this
wasnt
as
expensive
as
it
is
normally
when
its
not
on
special
i
would
order
it
more
often
top
notch
brew
kudos
surly
again
got
this
brew
as
an
extra
with
a
trade
from
skinnyguy
it
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
foamy
off
white
head
it
smells
exactly
like
a
pot
of
coffee
but
with
sweet
undertones
in
the
aroma
i
dont
really
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
i
cant
tell
if
im
impressed
with
it
or
not
very
strong
coffee
flavors
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
that
i
detected
in
the
nose
i
really
cant
explain
the
taste
of
this
too
well
if
i
had
to
take
a
stab
at
it
i
would
say
that
its
like
a
newcastle
with
a
cup
of
coffee
poured
in
it
buty
obviously
with
more
flavor
than
a
newcastle
overall
not
a
bad
brew
and
im
glad
that
i
got
to
try
it
i
always
look
forward
to
trying
new
beers
especially
ones
that
im
unable
to
obtain
in
massachusetts
d
i
wish
i
could
drink
one
of
these
in
the
morning
to
get
my
coffee
fix
screw
starbucks
i
want
coffee
bender
drinkability
its
not
bad
but
the
mouthfeel
really
let
me
down
a
bit
and
i
was
hoping
for
a
stronger
coffee
presence
in
the
mouth
and
not
just
the
nose
id
definitely
drink
it
again
but
im
not
sure
id
really
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
to
get
ahold
of
a
can
d
low
abv
delicious
flavor
cant
really
fault
this
one
except
for
the
strangeness
in
the
thin
mouthfeel
accompanied
by
the
coffee
flavor
really
interesting
take
on
a
brown
ale
with
great
results
by
the
time
i
finished
it
i
had
to
go
back
and
bump
up
this
review
on
the
appearance
i
actually
had
a
couple
maybe
a
dozen
very
small
coffee
grounds
in
the
bottom
of
my
glass
at
the
end
thats
just
awesome
drinkability
moderate
for
the
style
as
the
hops
knock
it
somewhat
offbalance
id
definitely
love
to
drink
this
for
breakfast
on
a
day
i
didnt
have
to
be
at
work
poured
this
bad
chicken
into
my
1845
pils
pint
coffee
bean
hued
plum
color
with
raging
little
bubbles
everywhere
thick
rich
head
with
wonderful
retention
and
thin
lacing
smells
like
a
bag
of
fresh
ground
coffee
beans
with
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
i
wish
the
coffee
shop
would
serve
this
to
me
blended
with
ice
on
the
way
to
work
coffee
up
front
then
a
bitter
touch
of
raw
beans
followed
up
by
an
nice
vanilla
malty
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
and
watery
but
the
taste
pays
dividends
5
this
is
my
new
early
morning
fishing
beer
it
says
coffee
on
the
can
so
it
must
be
good
for
you
d
easy
and
smooth
this
is
the
ultimate
coffee
lovers
beer
i
cant
decide
if
i
should
drink
it
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
or
for
breakfast
i
can
easily
drink
more
than
one
and
would
recommend
it
to
many
so
is
it
better
than
bender
well
maybe
a
little
despite
this
being
an
incredibly
tasty
beer
i
cant
ignore
the
fact
that
bender
is
too
i
think
the
coffee
flavor
gives
it
a
slight
edge
for
me
i
find
it
a
little
more
drinkable
as
a
result
but
theres
not
a
real
material
difference
theyre
both
spectacular
beers
but
i
believe
coffee
fans
will
find
just
enough
to
give
this
one
a
slight
edge
just
like
i
do
thanks
brad
this
is
excellent
stuff
i
feel
like
coffee
beers
work
better
when
a
big
creamy
stout
is
used
as
the
base
southern
tiers
jahva
remains
my
personal
standardbearer
even
though
this
isnt
my
favorite
surly
beer
its
still
a
quality
quaff
and
a
fairly
unusual
one
long
may
they
brew
and
can
thanks
to
mnwags
for
the
opportunity
16oz
can
courtesy
of
sonicdescent
interesting
beer
i
should
preface
this
by
saying
i
usually
like
about
15
beers
i
try
with
coffee
added
call
me
a
purist
anyway
pours
a
robust
brown
color
edges
of
ruby
not
unlike
the
regular
bender
but
i
think
its
a
little
lighter
if
that
makes
any
sense
at
all
and
not
as
nice
of
a
head
nose
is
all
coffee
really
great
clear
coffee
bean
aroma
unfortunately
thats
pretty
much
all
im
getting
besides
a
muted
cry
from
the
roasted
malt
trying
to
be
heard
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
just
find
it
a
bit
onedimensional
if
you
like
coffee
beers
this
will
surely
do
the
trick
i
really
like
the
coffee
flavor
im
getting
here
but
i
just
wish
there
was
more
to
go
along
with
it
in
this
case
i
had
the
regular
bender
the
other
night
and
thought
it
was
actually
more
full
and
more
complex
than
this
spiffed
up
version
mouthfeel
came
across
as
a
bit
thin
and
watery
i
dont
know
why
all
in
all
this
is
a
fine
beer
it
just
might
not
be
my
thing
ive
loved
everything
else
ive
tried
from
these
guys
so
this
beer
was
definitely
worth
the
try
especially
if
coffee
is
your
bag
shared
a
can
of
this
courtesy
of
grant
thanks
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
brownishblack
with
little
head
but
nice
color
nice
big
coffee
aroma
quite
fresh
smelling
and
earthy
and
a
little
vinous
more
lively
coffee
makes
an
early
appearance
in
the
taste
slightly
sweetened
very
balanced
and
this
is
coffee
black
done
well
very
smooth
and
only
slightly
sweet
very
nice
and
very
full
flavored
for
the
very
reasonable
abv
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sugary
with
a
bitter
coffee
ground
sting
being
felt
along
the
palate
during
the
finish
overall
a
stretch
for
the
style
most
beers
with
this
much
coffee
in
them
are
sturdier
brews
for
surly
to
add
this
much
coffee
to
a
style
as
easygoing
as
a
brown
ale
really
brings
the
coffee
all
the
way
to
the
front
go
get
some
oh
and
yeah
i
love
the
16ounce
can
i
want
more
beer
in
this
format
guess
what
it
smells
like
coffee
probably
no
surprise
there
but
it
also
has
a
nice
sweet
aroma
a
well
the
flavor
mimics
the
nose
with
a
light
bitter
finish
comparing
it
to
other
coffee
brews
i
have
experienced
this
is
a
lot
more
like
a
ice
coffee
flavor
and
feel
in
my
mouth
i
like
it
i
could
easily
see
myself
kicking
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
and
feel
quite
refreshed
if
you
are
into
ice
coffees
you
got
to
give
this
a
try
the
beer
smells
exactly
like
a
cold
coffee
with
a
slight
bit
of
chocolate
the
beer
is
poured
dark
brown
with
a
off
white
fluffy
head
when
drinking
this
beer
you
get
a
nice
hit
of
coffee
but
sweet
chocolate
and
hoppy
flavours
come
through
the
beer
is
so
tasty
the
balance
after
the
coffee
flavours
are
quite
flavourful
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
quite
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
what
i
love
about
this
beer
is
that
by
the
end
of
the
beer
you
dont
taste
as
much
coffee
but
the
hops
and
the
chocolate
sweetness
from
regular
bender
come
through
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
they
say
its
a
brown
ale
but
it
looks
black
nice
tan
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
almost
all
dark
roasted
blend
it
is
almost
like
i
am
smelling
an
iced
coffee
the
taste
is
much
the
same
has
a
great
refreshing
coffee
flavor
plus
a
ton
more
roasted
malts
goes
down
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
is
as
drinkable
as
a
cup
of
joe
drinkability
is
great
the
hop
bitterness
is
a
bit
more
than
i
like
in
a
brown
ale
which
is
probably
the
only
thing
holding
it
back
from
5s
in
taste
and
drinkability
but
thats
a
minor
quibble
bender
is
very
good
coffee
bender
is
superb
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
here
and
there
a
khaki
colored
two
finger
head
rests
atop
the
brew
with
very
little
webbing
clinging
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
coffee
with
a
good
dose
of
cream
and
sugar
roasted
malts
toffee
caramel
and
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
just
a
great
beer
to
stick
your
nose
into
more
bold
coffee
flavors
on
the
tongue
with
a
sweet
malty
backbone
midway
some
hops
and
vanilla
emerge
with
espresso
as
well
aftertaste
is
pretty
nutty
with
a
touch
of
cocoa
powder
light
body
with
a
soft
but
bitter
feel
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
smoother
but
the
light
body
definitely
is
a
plus
the
drinkability
suffers
only
slightly
from
the
sweetness
but
this
is
still
a
killer
coffee
brew
you
rock
todd
thanks
again
for
throwing
this
one
in
as
an
extra
d
this
was
a
very
good
well
crafted
beer
as
my
first
official
surly
review
i
must
admit
that
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
their
beers
d
this
is
very
flavorful
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
i
personally
felt
the
acidity
and
raw
coffee
flavor
was
a
little
too
much
to
handle
but
im
sure
coffee
lovers
will
get
their
fix
on
this
one
d
like
all
surly
beers
highly
sessionable
with
the
5
1
abv
i
could
put
these
back
all
night
very
enjoyable
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
is
i
every
turn
into
a
raging
alcoholic
and
need
to
start
my
morning
off
right
this
is
definitely
the
beer
i
would
go
to
d
drinks
like
iced
coffee
i
like
it
this
one
is
all
coffee
which
is
fine
with
me
yum
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
tan
head
over
the
cloudy
reddish
brown
brew
head
falls
gradually
with
heavy
and
leggy
lacing
aroma
is
rich
coffee
and
ample
sweetness
taste
follows
the
nose
more
acrid
from
the
coffee
closes
with
evident
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
reasonably
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
as
well
nice
one
overall
awesome
beer
try
it
and
savor
it
it
is
truly
unique
i
love
that
this
beer
doesnt
play
it
safe
its
not
going
for
a
hint
of
coffee
to
bring
out
highlights
in
the
beer
no
sir
weve
got
a
distinct
coffeeness
here
but
it
works
its
really
something
different
but
youve
got
to
commend
the
brewery
for
giving
something
like
this
a
shot
when
you
take
risks
like
that
everyone
once
in
a
while
it
works
out
this
is
an
example
of
it
working
out
this
is
coffee
beer
this
is
my
first
coffee
brown
ale
and
color
me
impressed
tasty
tasty
this
is
an
incredible
beer
period
beer
may
come
from
a
can
but
you
must
absolutely
drink
it
in
a
glass
d
as
stated
above
we
did
beer
floats
this
made
the
experience
more
fun
and
added
a
unique
dimension
as
the
coffee
up
front
was
followed
by
rich
sweet
cream
on
its
own
i
would
be
hesitant
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
d
id
love
to
try
one
of
these
for
breakfast
i
must
say
this
coffeeflavored
beer
is
excellent
its
really
nothing
like
the
original
bender
but
that
is
fine
this
packs
alot
of
flavor
into
a
really
sessionable
brew
highly
recommended
flavor
begins
with
a
creamy
almost
milklike
espresso
note
that
quickly
gives
way
to
dark
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
hints
of
vanilla
fig
and
pine
thrown
in
the
mix
and
the
aftertaste
is
laden
with
a
potent
hop
coffee
bitterness
body
is
a
tad
thin
but
well
carbonated
and
finishes
with
a
slight
dryness
all
in
all
an
exceptional
beer
that
bends
the
style
guidelines
but
tastes
so
good
it
can
afford
to
im
not
huge
on
coffee
but
when
i
have
it
id
rather
have
iced
which
makes
this
a
wonderful
choice
this
may
be
the
best
part
of
waking
up
if
only
it
were
acceptable
to
drink
in
the
morning
at
work
from
a
coffee
mug
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thin
for
a
beer
that
seems
to
be
a
porter
or
stout
refreshing
to
drink
and
very
nicly
done
poured
a
deep
and
dark
amber
color
almost
brown
with
a
an
averaged
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
coffee
roasty
pine
earthydiirt
and
nuts
tastes
of
coffee
roasty
vanilla
and
caramel
light
lacing
left
on
the
glass
this
brew
pours
up
a
dark
brown
color
with
crimson
edges
and
a
big
frothy
tan
head
the
nose
is
straight
coffee
big
malts
not
much
else
but
damn
it
smells
good
the
taste
is
coffee
bitterness
nice
malts
light
to
medium
body
medium
carbo
a
very
nice
brew
but
i
wish
that
it
could
have
had
a
little
bit
more
of
a
chewy
malt
characteristic
that
i
so
love
in
brown
ales
overall
a
coffee
bomb
dont
think
i
will
trade
for
this
one
again
but
i
was
glad
i
tried
it
aroma
of
lots
of
coffee
dark
malts
and
the
faintest
hop
aroma
a
very
nicely
smelling
coffee
beer
flavor
was
full
of
coffee
beans
some
chocolate
and
a
got
that
nice
malt
brown
ale
flavor
i
really
like
how
smooth
this
beer
is
its
very
creamy
and
very
drinkable
this
is
an
awesome
coffee
beer
too
bad
i
only
have
one
can
and
its
impossible
to
get
here
in
ny
overall
amazing
and
easy
to
drink
i
definitely
want
more
surly
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
as
it
is
allaround
amazing
if
you
like
coffee
beers
you
will
most
likely
find
this
appealing
if
you
are
looking
for
bender
with
subtle
coffee
notes
you
will
be
disappointed
as
this
is
a
coffee
bomb
this
is
a
great
drinking
very
rich
and
complex
beer
at
only
5
10
most
beers
with
this
much
flavor
also
have
a
super
high
abv
leaving
you
pretty
numb
i
love
it
i
need
more
low
abv
coffeee
brown
ales
slightly
more
head
than
the
standard
bender
and
somewhat
darker
the
coffee
flavor
is
strong
but
the
malt
base
still
comes
through
a
bit
expected
carbonation
not
much
for
hops
i
like
this
a
lot
im
glad
they
made
it
a
standard
offering
i
acquired
this
through
a
trade
with
wery0001
i
poured
from
a
16
ounce
can
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
fuzzy
white
head
it
has
great
aroma
it
is
sweet
dark
roasted
coffee
the
flavor
follows
it
has
great
balance
a
great
combination
of
beer
and
coffee
the
beer
has
medium
body
and
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
better
than
my
normal
cup
of
morning
joe
drinkability
as
touted
on
the
can
this
is
an
iced
coffee
for
adults
smooth
and
immensely
drinkable
it
is
also
very
flavorful
another
hit
from
surly
i
hope
they
eventually
expand
their
distribution
but
will
give
them
time
to
do
it
right
d
great
breakfast
beer
coffee
flavor
pairs
well
with
what
is
a
very
wellbalanced
drinkable
american
brown
ale
wish
i
had
a
sixer
of
this
note
to
self
1
american
brown
ale
when
i
tried
it
d
nice
and
light
you
forget
your
a
drinking
an
alcoholic
beverage
after
a
few
drinks
very
little
to
no
lingering
aftertaste
very
easy
going
beer
drink
it
till
you
cant
sleep
surly
does
not
make
a
bad
product
ok
so
another
good
offering
from
surly
but
definately
not
my
favorite
appearance
is
good
nice
deep
brown
color
lots
of
life
to
it
smell
and
taste
are
quite
similar
unfortunately
im
not
a
huge
coffee
fan
and
that
kind
of
overpowers
the
rest
of
what
is
going
on
some
malt
and
rather
sweet
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
medium
in
body
drinkability
is
good
but
again
coffee
is
not
really
my
thing
so
a
bit
much
for
me
i
dont
like
this
quite
as
much
as
regular
bender
as
the
coffee
masks
the
hoppiness
that
i
really
like
and
gets
a
bit
tiring
after
a
pint
or
two
its
still
a
nice
lighter
coffee
brew
pours
a
slightly
murky
dark
reddish
orange
light
brown
hues
very
thick
tan
head
forms
drops
a
ton
of
lace
chunks
on
the
glass
slowly
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
good
retention
looks
nice
smell
is
yummy
caramel
toast
floral
and
grapefruit
hops
nice
and
earthy
light
coffee
roast
fruit
pineapple
biscuity
malt
coffee
plays
real
nice
with
the
normal
bender
taste
is
just
as
nice
caramel
and
biscuit
dry
toasty
malts
light
chocolate
coffee
grapefruit
and
pineapple
although
not
as
pronounced
as
the
aroma
earthy
light
bit
of
sour
fruit
more
coffee
roast
nicely
balanced
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
smooth
and
drinkable
still
think
i
prefer
the
regular
bender
but
the
coffee
gives
this
a
pretty
cool
dimension
just
enough
to
make
it
interesting
really
nice
stuff
thanks
scotty
future
outlook
sigh
i
love
all
3
of
the
surly
brews
that
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
try
but
i
cannot
purchase
surly
here
in
ohio
so
ill
enjoy
the
few
i
have
left
and
then
start
wondering
when
and
from
where
my
next
fix
will
arrive
d
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
its
just
a
matter
of
how
much
coffee
taste
the
drinker
can
stand
personally
2
in
a
sitting
is
enough
for
me
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
i
honestly
didnt
know
that
coffee
bender
would
be
this
good
then
again
with
bender
as
a
base
beer
it
would
pretty
hard
to
go
wrong
no
matter
what
was
added
within
reason
the
original
is
still
the
best
but
damn
this
is
outstanding
ale
d
im
enjoying
this
though
i
prefer
the
noncoffee
version
more
ultimately
i
believe
bender
from
futurama
would
truly
be
proud
to
share
a
name
with
such
a
fantastic
beer
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
just
a
really
great
coffee
beer
not
the
best
i
have
had
but
a
damn
fine
beer
i
would
be
putting
away
cans
of
this
on
the
regular
if
it
were
available
near
me
again
thanks
go
out
to
pepsican
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
pours
a
translucent
brown
in
color
with
a
good
inch
of
head
forming
on
the
pour
to
be
honest
it
looks
a
bit
thin
smell
is
subtle
but
well
done
coffee
taste
is
good
a
near
perfect
balance
between
brown
ale
and
coffee
the
coffee
doesnt
dominate
the
underlying
beer
and
is
a
complimentary
flavor
to
the
overall
offering
very
well
done
easy
and
very
smooth
drinking
for
a
coffee
flavored
beer
another
great
one
from
surly
overall
amazing
beer
great
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
and
lightmedium
bodied
not
as
drinkable
as
bender
though
the
taste
wears
you
down
a
bit
thanks
just
the
same
to
joe
for
including
it
as
an
extra
im
always
looking
to
try
a
new
beer
poured
into
my
surly
glass
a
very
nice
dark

nice

very
nice

pours
a

the

and
mocha
the
flavor
is
esspreso
bean
dominating
toasty
malts
with
a
sharp
grassyherbal
hop
off
the
back
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
and
crisp
finishing
dryish
in
my
opinion
its
not
as
rich
and
complex
as
the
original
bender
but
on
the
other
hand
the
original
bender
isnt
made
with
coffee
either
iced
espresso
plus
alcohol
equals
satisfaction
the
coffee
is
very
pronounced
in
a
good
way
i
didnt
expect
to
like
it
this
much
its
very
dark
and
has
a
healthy
amount
of
foam
when
you
pour
it
but
it
goes
away
quickly
md
medium
bodied
and
nice
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
tasting
beer
and
im
glad
i
have
a
six
pack
sitting
in
my
fridge
courtesy
of
dbhog
served
in
my
sa
sensory
pint
poured
a
deep
brown
that
appears
maroon
when
backlit
frothy
one
inch
head
slowly
receded
leaving
behind
thick
bands
of
lacing
robust
roasted
coffee
nose
incredible
aroma
with
no
charred
characteristics
taste
follows
nose
but
also
detected
a
nutty
quality
in
the
mix
with
a
touch
of
char
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
creamy
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
mild
carbonation
incredibly
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
what
an
amazing
session
brew
i
am
quickly
becoming
a
surly
fan
d
quite
drinkable
from
a
abv
standpoint
and
overall
feel
i
love
coffee
but
more
beer
here
would
be
nice
one
or
two
of
these
would
be
my
limit
d
would
tire
d
extremely
drinkable
i
am
sad
i
shared
this
with
my
friends
since
i
cant
get
it
up
here
as
the
beer
warms
up
it
starts
taking
on
a
less
bitter
more
sweet
flavor
the
feel
is
still
thick
and
almost
chewy
but
very
refreshing
this
beer
couples
well
with
a
lot
of
desserts
i
make
and
also
stands
alone
as
a
fine
testament
of
alcoholic
beverages
to
sum
it
up
in
one
word
yum
d
a
very
good
and
very
drinkable
brew
if
there
is
any
knock
against
it
this
one
is
not
as
complex
as
most
surly
offerings
still
a
very
fine
beer
from
an
excellent
brewery
seek
it
out
coats
your
tongue
like
a
frappe
good
ass
beer
i
think
i
can
taste
the
cigarettes
and
early
winter
morning
chill
when
drinking
this
beer
excellent
brew
wow
i
had
to
come
back
in
and
amend
my
review
this
beer
really
hits
me
in
two
distinct
ways
i
feel
like
i
just
pounded
a
triple
shot
espresso
of
dark
italian
roast
and
like
i
mainlined
some
180
proof
feel
great
all
to
the
head
very
clean
feels
very
nice
overall
a
very
nice
beer
from
surly
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
im
not
sure
i
would
buy
this
one
regularly
but
its
a
nice
novelty
dlower
abv
makes
this
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
it
would
be
a
tough
call
between
my
morning
coffee
or
a
coffee
bender
on
the
weekends
drinkability
is
awesome
ill
be
picking
this
up
again
highly
recommended
16oz
can
thanks
to
vwcraig
dark
brown
red
tints
smells
like
a
handful
of
roasted
beans
the
flavor
nails
the
coffee
aspect
and
reminds
me
of
a
truly
enjoyable
morning
cup
as
opposed
to
a
lot
of
the
other
coffee
beers
that
taste
more
like
old
grounds
than
fresh
coffee
i
dont
usually
like
coffee
beers
but
this
one
is
an
exception
i
like
the
interplay
between
coffee
and
maltiness
but
i
think
it
could
be
better
im
guessing
that
mixing
coffee
and
beer
is
just
difficult
to
get
perfect
but
given
surlys
dedication
to
making
great
beer
im
sure
they
will
keep
improving
big
ol
kudos
to
jjanega08
for
the
4
pack
if
only
i
could
keep
my
s
o
from
drinking
the
rest
drinkability
at
5
1
this
is
one
very
sessionable
brew
flavorful
rich
aromatic
and
smooth
while
still
being
assertive
a
definite
recommendation
especially
if
you
like
coffee
which
just
so
happens
to
be
true
for
me
dark
ruby
body
fluffy
brown
head
has
great
retention
lacing
is
quite
full
nice
mix
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
on
the
nose
coffee
is
the
domineering
aroma
as
it
should
be
the
flavor
is
very
nicely
integrated
i
love
the
bender
and
even
though
this
has
a
heavy
coffee
influence
on
the
buds
the
bender
traits
are
still
perceptible
almost
like
a
coffee
milkshake
nice
creamy
body
and
light
carbonation
quite
drinkable
a
good
beer
breakfast
or
desert
i
can
only
think
of
2
coffee
beers
that
ive
liked
better
bells
java
stout
and
central
waters
coffee
stout
another
winner
in
a
can
from
surly
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
with
some
good
coffee
character
thanks
jason
for
passing
along
my
way
i
appreciate
your
generous
trades
quite
drinkable
although
not
recommended
for
those
who
arent
into
coffee
perhaps
too
bold
and
complex
to
be
a
true
session
beer
but
i
could
easily
see
knocking
a
few
pints
of
this
back
at
a
sitting
im
thinking
this
would
be
a
perfect
brew
in
front
of
a
fire
after
a
long
day
im
happy
they
are
canning
this
one
and
will
be
drinking
this
again
very
soon
highly
recommended
for
fans
of
coffee
i
will
purchase
this
again
but
i
will
purchase
much
more
furious
to
just
keep
on
hand
this
beer
pours
nearly
opaque
deep
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
into
nice
rings
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
coffee
beans
with
nutty
caramel
malt
beneath
the
taste
is
a
little
maltier
than
the
aroma
but
there
is
still
a
ton
of
coffee
there
is
all
the
malty
depth
of
regular
bender
but
it
seems
more
accentuated
by
the
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
have
a
feeling
that
i
will
be
drinking
this
beer
a
lot
this
falls
under
the
novelty
coffee
uppercase
beer
lowercase
category
not
that
i
dont
like
this
a
lot
but
id
like
to
have
a
coffee
beer
that
is
more
beer
and
less
coffee
pours
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
ruby
highlights
a
nice
fluffy
tan
head
and
good
lacing
down
the
surly
coffee
mug
nice
bitter
coffee
aroma
some
good
hop
smells
coming
in
at
the
end
all
mixed
with
some
light
chocolate
very
nice
coffee
flavor
here
silky
smooth
roasty
malts
and
a
light
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
is
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
as
it
is
but
the
coffee
brings
it
to
another
level
ive
had
it
on
tap
before
darkness
day
and
i
think
i
prefered
the
tap
version
its
seemed
a
little
creamier
and
more
silky
than
from
the
can
but
its
still
delicious
nonetheless
very
nice
surly
youve
done
it
again
the
tap
has
a
bit
more
creamyness
and
smoothness
to
it
from
what
i
remember
time
to
experiment
and
find
out
where
i
might
find
any
real
differences
hv
poured
very
dark
brown
with
minimal
head
strong
smell
of
coffee
taste
is
wonderful
strong
coffee
taste
with
roasted
malts
perfect
carbonation
is
very
light
from
look
expected
a
little
more
thickness
to
it
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
a
couple
of
these
very
smooth
wonderful
coffee
flavor
but
it
seems
unbalanced
in
this
relatively
light
body
other
coffee
beers
have
more
substance
to
them
does
not
look
as
nice
as
regular
bender
as
a
head
never
really
forms
and
there
is
minimal
lacing
left
on
the
glass
coffee
dominants
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
do
not
get
anything
to
even
come
close
to
balance
or
compliment
the
coffee
i
just
feel
coffee
compliments
bigger
beers
than
a
brown
ale
from
a
can
poured
into
a
smaller
tasting
glass
and
shared
with
others
appearance
is
a
murky
amber
brown
with
a
tan
head
decent
lacing
aroma
smells
awesome
of
freshly
ground
highquality
coffee
and
some
citrus
hops
in
the
background
taste
was
a
little
disappointing
compared
to
the
aroma
first
off
was
the
thin
mouthfeel
which
surprised
me
considering
the
lineup
of
big
beers
that
surly
makes
the
flavors
were
rather
thin
too
and
was
dominated
by
the
coffee
with
little
malt
or
hop
flavor
to
balance
things
out
too
much
carbonation
in
this
beer
probably
allowed
the
mouthfeel
to
seem
a
little
thin
ill
try
it
again
but
ive
had
much
better
coffee
beers
than
this
dark
black
head
fades
rather
quick
aroma
is
very
pleasant
like
a
good
black
coffee
with
a
noticable
back
im
pretty
impressed
with
that
aspect
taste
is
good
the
original
bender
is
still
apparent
but
its
accented
with
the
wonderful
coffee
flavors
and
either
more
chocolate
or
the
chocolate
flavor
is
also
created
with
the
addition
of
the
coffee
im
getting
a
kick
out
of
these
surly
brews
worth
a
taste
for
sure
d
pretty
damn
drinkable
considering
how
much
coffee
i
drink
low
abv
and
plenty
of
coffee
smoothness
to
keep
enjoying
yeah
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
i
wish
it
came
in
6
paks
this
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
likes
coffee
and
likes
beer
costs
about
12
for
a
4
pack
3
a
beer
aint
so
bad
if
you
consider
that
last
week
the
only
place
to
find
this
was
at
the
bar
its
awesome
to
have
another
surly
brew
in
cans
i
have
never
had
this
beer
on
tap
so
it
was
new
to
me
i
was
a
little
surprised
that
it
wasnt
more
coffeelike
good
stuff
though
i
think
i
may
like
regular
bender
a
little
more
as
the
original
seems
to
be
a
little
sweeter
than
this
one
d
usually
i
dont
find
coffee
beers
that
drinkable
but
this
one
is
very
easy
drinking
this
is
surprising
giving
how
much
coffee
is
actually
present
this
was
a
great
coffee
beer
one
of
my
favorites
lighter
then
others
in
feel
but
the
freshness
of
the
brewed
coffee
flavor
was
soo
spot
on
i
am
very
happy
to
have
a
good
supply
of
this
one
d
very
high
screams
session
i
was
leery
of
trying
this
beer
because
i
am
a
huge
surly
fan
and
because
of
the
hype
did
not
want
a
let
down
no
worries
it
was
a
great
experience
the
smell
of
coffee
is
much
more
prominent
that
i
expected
the
chocolate
flavors
really
come
thru
as
well
very
good
drinkability
not
sure
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
but
i
would
maybe
alternate
between
a
coffee
bender
and
furious
cheers
d
pretty
damn
drinkable
considering
how
much
coffee
i
drink
low
abv
and
plenty
of
coffee
smoothness
to
keep
enjoying
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
and
a
great
release
from
surly
i
am
very
happy
this
is
now
in
cans
and
i
will
do
my
part
to
make
sure
it
pays
off
for
omar
and
every
one
else
at
surly
very
nice
pick
me
up
after
a
very
long
day
at
work
maybe
ill
have
on
for
breakfast
overall
this
in
my
humble
opinion
is
a
worldclass
coffee
beer
and
thats
what
you
can
expect
from
surly
worldclass
beers
when
i
first
had
this
beer
it
seemed
a
bit
more
coffee
forward
but
now
out
of
the
can
it
seems
a
lot
more
balanced
i
used
to
tell
my
pals
that
enjoy
good
beer
to
try
this
brew
even
if
they
didnt
like
coffee
well
now
that
rings
more
true
than
ever
this
is
the
perfect
balance
between
beer
and
coffee
and
i
am
practically
giddy
that
i
have
three
more
cans
in
my
fridge
obtain
this
however
you
can
mouthfeel
is
great
for
a
brown
ale
but
this
isnt
a
brown
ale
it
is
a
little
thin
for
a
porter
but
this
isnt
a
porter
oh
i
am
confused
this
is
way
too
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
see
the
caffeine
and
alchohol
fighting
out
which
should
win
d
extremely
drinkable
will
definitely
have
this
gem
again
dmy
only
regret
with
this
beer
is
that
i
had
it
after
having
several
other
beers
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
as
my
first
of
the
night
oh
and
get
a
growlerhint
hint
very
good
beer
and
as
always
im
impressed
with
surly

1
d
coffee
bender
is
crazy
drinkable
i
probably
wouldnt
be
able
to
put
down
more
than
a
couple
pints
at
a
time
but
those
pints
would
go
down
very
smooth
another
winner
from
todd
and
surly
surly
knows
how
to
do
it
and
theyve
done
it
again
this
is
fantastic
beer
and
i
would
get
myself
a
ton
of
this
if
i
lived
nearby
i
had
two
pints
on
tap
and
felt
like
moving
on
but
my
sister
gave
me
a
4
pack
of
regular
bender
and
ive
been
leaving
a
cup
or
so
of
coffee
in
my
press
each
morning
to
stir
in
with
my
beers
that
night
one
to
go
das
the
mug
stated
its
never
to
early
to
get
surly
i
could
easily
see
myself
enjoying
this
brew
with
breakfast
dont
know
if
thats
good
or
bad
i
thought
it
was
tasty
maybe
not
overly
complicated
but
enjoyably
different
had
it
out
of
the
can
about
six
months
later
proves
to
be
a
bit
more
of
an
american
porter
style
to
the
porter
part
of
the
beer
chocolatey
with
a
nice
coffee
coming
to
realize
that
this
is
a
fantastic
midwest
opportunity
the
more
i
have
it
the
more
i
like
it
so
maybe
its
better
than
i
think
read
some
other
reviews
im
flailing
here
i
have
always
enjoyed
surly
products
and
was
excited
to
enjoy
this
one
while
at
flossmoor
station
this
beer
pours
like
and
looks
like
missippi
muddy
water
while
a
dark
beer
it
doesnt
have
the
presence
of
an
oilcolored
stout
the
smell
is
about
average
and
brings
a
nice
aeroma
of
coffe
and
malt
to
the
nose
as
for
drinking
it
is
quite
tasty
without
an
overbearing
taste
of
coffee
because
of
some
of
these
charactoristics
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
and
several
can
be
enjoyed
in
the
same
sitting
without
doing
too
much
damage
pours
a
muddy
murky
brown
looks
almost
creamy
a
good
frothy
head
forms
and
holds
pretty
good
for
so
much
froth
good
lacing
tons
of
coffee
maybe
a
bit
of
toffee
or
cocoa
in
the
back
but
mostly
just
big
time
coffee
taste
reminds
me
of
a
great
iced
coffee
with
an
adult
twist
very
nice
raw
flavors
deeply
roasted
coffee
with
a
nice
harsh
touch
sweetness
balances
things
out
a
bit
body
is
actually
only
medium
and
has
a
great
creaminess
drinks
every
good
and
went
great
with
my
brunch
ontap
at
barley
johns
the
aroma
is
coffeeih
good
looks
black
with
lots
of
white
head
better
tasting
than
town
halls
coffee
stout
average
mouthfeel
appropriate
carbonation
just
too
coffee
what
is
it
about
these
local
coffee
beersi
just
couldnt
take
more
than
a
couple
sips
overated
on
tap
pours
a
deep
brown
with
half
a
finger
of
mocha
head
nose
huge
waft
of
coffee
rinds
very
fresh
and
medium
roast
some
chocolate
just
beautiful
taste
fresh
coffee
in
forefront
with
nuts
caramel
and
light
milk
chocolate
freaking
delicious
mouthfell
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
on
the
low
side
to
made
it
go
down
like
melted
butter
hops
show
up
in
the
finish
to
help
clean
away
the
strong
coffee
flavour
and
make
you
go
back
for
more
today
was
my
first
dance
with
coffee
bender
and
hopefully
i
see
this
one
around
more
often
bender
is
very
unique
and
enjoyable
brown
ale
all
by
itself
the
addition
of
coffee
just
adds
to
the
depth
of
the
original
drinkability
this
is
by
far
my
new
favorite
brew
and
probably
favorite
of
all
time
i
think
it
edged
out
the
abyss
and
alaskan
smoked
porter
i
drove
all
the
way
to
minneapolis
to
drink
as
much
darkness
as
possible
and
ended
up
have
two
glasses
of
it
and
probably
ten
glasses
of
this
obviously
i
love
my
coffee
i
also
loves
me
a
good
brown
ale
well
bender
coffee
amazing
seek
this
out
for
a
coffee
beer
this
stuff
is
very
drinkable
you
kind
of
have
to
like
coffee
to
really
enjoy
this
one
to
its
full
extent
as
its
bursting
with
it
d
decently
good
drinkability
though
the
big
coffee
flavors
make
this
one
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
all
night
definitely
worth
a
try
though
drinkability
is
great
coffee
and
beer
i
love
it
surly
hits
another
home
run
here
as
with
some
of
the
other
nuts
on
this
site
i
also
had
this
wonerful
concoction
at
about
800
am
at
darkness
day
when
they
set
out
a
keg
for
all
to
have
a
verry
classy
move
if
i
do
say
so
my
self
anyways
on
to
the
reveiw
most
delicious
with
the
smell
of
fresh
coffee
just
the
kick
i
was
looking
for
the
flavor
of
a
nice
french
press
cup
of
good
coffee
not
to
be
comfused
with
the
crap
i
drink
all
day
at
work
an
exceptionaly
smooth
feel
and
man
oh
man
could
i
drink
this
all
day
long
but
the
keg
was
dry
soon
after
no
appearance
decription
as
i
drank
mine
out
of
a
20
oz
dite
coke
bottle
i
found
in
the
back
seat
of
my
car
md
very
smooth
to
drink
but
im
not
very
sure
how
much
of
this
i
could
drink
as
im
not
much
of
a
coffee
drinker
to
start
with
its
good
to
have
on
occasion
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
session
this
goes
down
like
water
even
at
8
am
thanks
for
turning
my
cute
little
drinking
problem
into
fullblown
alcoholism
surly
for
coffee
lovers
a
very
nice
treat
indeed
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
crisp
and
smooth
this
is
really
an
easy
drinking
coffee
brew
and
very
damn
enjoyable
if
you
ask
me
i
would
have
like
to
have
ordered
another
but
i
had
to
run
one
of
my
favorite
surly
offerings
from
fests
and
im
glad
to
see
it
on
tap
in
my
area
d
i
could
have
this
all
day
long
which
was
unexpected
from
a
coffeestyle
beer
absolutely
another
great
beer
from
surly
big
coffee
flavor
high
quality
freshly
ground
acidic
fruitiness
long
lingering
bitterdry
finish
nutty
almond
flavor
lightly
malty
the
coffee
really
dominates
but
its
balanced
enough
to
drink
quite
a
bit
easy
going
with
light
carbonation
this
is
a
unique
and
flavorful
coffee
beer
not
too
underoverdone
just
right
nice
coffee
flavors
really
meld
with
the
brown
ale
characteristics
and
subdue
the
hop
somewhat
until
the
very
finish
hints
of
milk
chocolate
burnt
malts
dark
breads
roasty
caramel
tones
with
a
good
amount
of
light
coffee
showing
in
the
middle
that
leads
into
a
piney
earthy
hop
finish
not
overly
complex
with
a
mouthfeel
that
shows
spicey
carbonation
very
good
and
easy
drinking
but
something
has
got
me
d
yet
again
another
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
and
all
night
if
you
put
this
under
my
nose
with
a
blindfold
one
i
would
never
ever
mistake
this
for
a
beer
i
dont
really
see
how
that
description
fits
into
the
drinkablility
factor
but
thinking
about
it
makes
me
want
another
one
of
these
beers
so
bad
it
makes
my
brain
hurt
just
thinking
about
it
ive
noted
this
before
but
i
like
flavored
beers
more
with
brown
ales
than
porters
i
like
the
blending
better
and
the
drinkability
this
is
a
good
drinking
experience
d
another
tasty
brew
from
surly
one
id
want
to
find
again
perhaps
at
the
source
i
found
it
good
but
not
as
outstanding
as
many
previous
reviewers
coffee
flavor
grew
a
little
heavy
and
bitter
but
i
am
a
fan
of
dark
roasts
and
drink
my
coffee
black
so
i
was
still
pleased
not
the
type
of
beer
youd
want
to
have
every
day
but
certainly
a
nice
addition
to
the
lineup
im
glad
surly
finally
made
an
appearance
in
oregon
after
drinking
a
can
of
furious
last
week
this
beer
more
then
any
other
was
something
i
was
looking
forward
to
at
the
obf
all
the
more
reason
it
was
the
disappointment
of
the
festival
maybe
it
just
didnt
travel
well
from
minn
to
portland
oh
well
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
map
room
in
chicago
previously
ive
had
the
standard
bender
from
a
can
several
times
thanks
to
my
brother
in
minneapolis
but
its
been
a
while
and
i
cant
compare
it
easily
with
this
coffeeinfused
version
anyway
the
coffee
style
is
really
good
the
beer
is
very
dark
almost
black
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
foam
the
aroma
is
coffee
and
chocolate
a
little
sweet
malt
also
very
appetizing
and
the
taste
is
just
as
good
lots
of
coffee
a
solid
malt
base
and
a
little
chocolate
sweetness
as
well
maybe
my
imagination
ive
liked
just
about
every
coffee
beer
ive
tried
and
surly
does
it
well
dthis
is
a
wonderful
coffee
beer
a
light
bodied
brew
wtih
gobs
of
coffee
i
love
it
glad
i
had
this
beer
i
would
not
drink
it
all
night
long
but
it
was
a
great
way
to
start
the
night
d
this
left
a
wonderful
high
quality
coffee
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
so
sessionable
i
could
start
with
this
one
in
the
morning
and
drink
it
all
day
had
this
at
the
tasting
last
night
at
common
roots
cafe
this
was
my
first
coffee
infused
beer
and
it
was
quite
enjoyable
the
appearance
was
a
little
muddy
but
attractive
im
curious
to
know
if
its
difficult
for
the
coffee
to
completely
meld
with
the
beer
the
smell
was
of
what
else
coffee
a
nice
dark
rich
coffee
it
was
the
taste
that
really
got
me
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
and
hops
seemed
to
compliment
encourage
and
smooth
each
other
other
as
if
they
were
always
meant
to
be
together
nice
creaminess
and
very
drinkable
especially
during
the
extreme
cold
were
having
now
its
not
something
that
i
would
want
to
have
at
any
time
but
it
is
very
good
poured
out
black
with
a
nice
head
that
retained
well
smell
was
of
old
coffee
maybe
a
little
cream
to
the
nose
as
well
wasnt
good
taste
was
full
of
old
and
not
enjoyable
coffee
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
levels
drinkability
is
not
good
i
didnt
even
finish
my
first
glass
of
it
surly
makes
good
beer
but
this
was
disappointing
give
me
the
regular
bender
roast
beef
chocolate
maybe
some
game
a
superb
coffee
beer
in
all
aspects
really
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
i
find
myself
anxiously
awaiting
them
to
canbottle
this
upon
first
taste
i
realized
this
was
the
perfect
beer
to
this
even
10am
sitting
around
with
a
bunch
of
folk
whove
been
up
for
hours
coffee
rich
and
glorious
roasted
coffee
paired
with
that
beautiful
brew
bender
sweet
toffee
chocolate
all
those
fine
qualities
plus
the
added
dimension
make
this
one
special
brew
the
body
and
carbonation
are
the
same
as
normal
bender
very
creamy
smooth
three
cheers
to
the
surly
crew
for
one
fine
beverage
d
defiantly
a
nice
drinkable
coffee
beer
this
beer
is
very
nicely
balanced
making
it
more
enjoyable
than
standard
coffee
beers
in
my
opinion
probably
the
only
chance
ill
get
at
this
beauty
glad
to
have
been
given
the
opportunity
overall
i
really
liked
the
beer
but
its
certainly
not
an
everyday
beer
tip
of
the
cap
to
coffee
tea
limited
who
apparently
provide
the
coffee
for
the
cb
im
sure
you
will
benefit
from
this
partnership
the
drinkability
was
very
good
this
is
one
fine
easy
drrinking
coffee
brew
prosit
mk
d
very
easy
and
simple
to
drink
not
hard
at
all
as
some
coffee
beers
can
be
d
this
is
the
second
best
coffee
beer
ive
had
next
to
the
legendary
speedway
stout
but
the
speedway
didnt
focus
on
the
coffee
like
this
one
does
tremendous
this
is
so
much
better
than
the
standard
bender
its
ridiculous
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
the
privilege
of
drinking
the
friends
who
shared
the
growler
with
were
also
very
impressed
and
the
beer
went
faster
than
i
thought
for
such
a
flavorful
beer
it
was
extremely
drinkable
in
fact
i
wish
i
was
drinking
it
right
now
a
big
caffeinated
thanks
to
my
sis
for
procuring
a
growler
of
this
for
me
at
xmas
it
would
be
nice
to
pour
this
from
the
coffee
pot
every
morning
great
beer
this
beer
has
a
remarkable
scent
it
smells
like
starbucks
coffee
i
think
that
it
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
and
that
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
smell
and
taste
are
absolutely
wonderful
and
i
could
drink
this
all
night
just
tried
the
canned
version
and
this
is
beer
is
more
balanced
but
hardly
less
tasty
you
can
still
taste
the
malts
and
hops
here
delicious
same
dark
brown
as
regular
bender
identical
until
the
nose
massive
rich
fresh
brewed
coffee
it¬ís
rare
that
a
coffee
beer
smell
this
fresh
and
deep
i
could
smell
this
beer
all
day
perfect
taste
is
much
more
like
the
standard
bender
at
first
but
with
a
little
more
warmth
the
coffee
really
stands
out
and
is
great
with
the
roasted
and
hoppy
flavors
of
the
bender
great
rare
yet
worth
seeking
out
keep
em
coming
surly
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
alright
so
the
regular
bender
by
surly
is
one
outstanding
beer
its
tough
to
put
your
finger
on
just
what
it
is
porter
or
brown
ale
but
there
is
belgian
malts
and
its
quite
hoppy
as
feloniousmonk
the
first
reviewer
of
this
beer
said
benders
more
subtle
qualities
definitely
get
wiped
out
by
this
coffee
infused
treat
but
who
cares
this
beer
is
awesome
if
you
didnt
tell
them
some
people
might
not
even
know
there
was
booze
in
this
right
when
you
handed
it
to
them
it
is
dark
rich
and
bitter
just
like
espresso
when
we
finally
got
to
try
this
at
the
blue
nile
we
just
sat
around
smelling
this
beer
for
probably
5
minutes
or
so
before
we
even
tasted
it
it
was
almost
like
putting
your
nose
into
a
bag
of
fresh
ground
coffee
delicious
the
taste
was
rich
and
bitter
like
espresso
but
oh
wait
the
edge
gets
taken
off
because
its
actually
a
beer
a
deep
creamy
beer
at
that
perfect
combination
thank
you
surly
this
would
be
a
tough
one
to
have
more
than
two
beers
of
it¬ís
just
too
rich
and
dark
but
the
two
you
do
are
damn
good
medium
to
full
body
long
coffeetinged
finish
unflinchingly
flavorful
and
still
an
easy
treat
to
drink
down
this
has
met
with
near
unanimous
praise
among
those
ive
witness
enjoy
it
and
i
can
only
hope
its
attempted
again
and
again
so
that
more
may
discover
this
jolt
of
joy
for
java
freaks
and
beer
geeks
alike
flavorful
for
sure
but
too
much
going
on
all
at
once
never
resolves
better
the
second
time
i
tried
coffee
nose
taste
is
initially
coffee
then
vanilla
then
chocolate
on
the
finish
tends
to
blur
a
bit
though
didnt
get
to
spend
as
much
time
drinking
this
as
id
have
liked
to
as
i
had
to
leave
on
tap
at
lp
binnys
but
this
was
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
and
definitely
something
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
a
coffee
drinker
surly
continues
to
impress
overall
initially
it
was
hard
to
find
exactly
how
to
differentiate
cacao
bender
from
coffee
bender
from
the
aroma
alone
it
smells
like
walking
to
a
starbucks
straight
up
to
say
otherwise
would
be
a
stretch
of
the
truth
with
warmth
the
bittered
cacao
does
begin
to
seep
through
the
cracks
of
that
coffee
wall
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
much
more
amped
up
you
get
so
much
of
that
coffee
and
its
raw
and
black
as
ever
up
front
but
the
kicker
is
that
this
is
bolstered
by
equally
as
raw
dark
and
bittering
dark
chocolate
with
each
sip
it
dries
you
out
a
touch
more
and
clamps
down
just
a
little
bit
harder
with
that
chalky
bittering
puck
ultimately
the
cacao
doesnt
seem
any
more
robust
than
the
coffee
but
together
and
coming
fresh
off
the
tap
it
is
pure
enjoyment
overall
a
fabulous
brew
what
a
beautiful
beer
less
coffee
intense
than
the
coffee
bender
but
still
plenty
of
it
there
both
in
nose
and
taste
also
a
whole
lot
of
cocoa
and
vanilla
a
cool
mix
extremely
aromatic
in
this
brown
ale
that
already
exhibits
properties
of
all
three
of
these
ingredients
in
its
base
form
short
fizzy
cream
head
here
medium
brown
full
bodied
beer
coffee
first
on
the
nose
but
the
aromatic
vanilla
is
close
in
tow
the
cacao
is
way
more
present
in
the
taste
bitter
buttery
earthy
all
in
the
finish
over
a
nice
dark
chocolate
malt
base
its
a
fantastically
well
built
beer
with
great
carbonation
and
a
cleanness
for
how
dark
and
flavorful
it
is
one
of
the
best
from
surly
and
probably
honestly
my
favorite
of
the
three
versions
i
have
had
coffee
blends
so
well
with
the
vanilla
where
as
in
the
coffee
bender
its
almost
too
much
just
iced
coffee
basically
this
does
a
good
job
of
being
beer
first
i
love
it
wish
we
got
it
all
the
time
here
just
a
taste
nice
roasted
coffee
grounds
chocolate
a
hint
of
vanilla
overall
a
magnificent
beer
one
of
the
best
of
2014
overall
a
really
nicely
made
beers
with
enjoyable
and
well
combined
flavors
sadly
surly
does
not
distribute
to
my
home
state
of
pennsylvania
or
id
be
all
over
this
one
every
week
come
to
think
of
it
maybe
its
a
good
thing
they
dont
ooverall
great
beer
had
to
order
another
o
a
great
addition
to
a
great
brown
ale
this
is
a
terrific
beer
and
exactly
how
breweries
should
use
chocolate
this
is
a
great
balance
of
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
chocolate
nice
and
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thin
but
long
lasting
cocoa
colored
head
the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
at
first
like
a
milk
chocolate
bar
but
some
dark
cocoa
and
roasted
malt
notes
come
in
stronger
as
it
warms
initially
it
tasted
sweet
but
in
the
back
of
the
palate
it
becomes
slightly
bitter
and
roasty
it
is
silky
smooth
in
body
with
moderately
low
carbonation
really
a
top
quality
beer
definitely
worth
seeking
out
all
in
all
so
impressed
the
girl
i
was
with
was
impressed
enough
to
order
her
own
despite
the
fact
this
beer
was
the
only
beer
not
on
happy
hour
special
very
interesting
take
on
coffee
bender
i
think
if
they
decreased
the
coffee
contribution
and
let
the
other
adjuncts
shine
even
more
they
would
have
an
even
bigger
hit
on
their
hands
benders
never
been
my
favorite
of
the
surly
beers
so
what
surly
has
done
with
this
take
on
it
is
remarkable
chocolate
takes
the
lead
in
fact
this
has
more
of
a
chocolate
presence
than
most
chocolate
forward
beers
a
woody
grainy
sensation
follows
but
it
wasnt
aged
on
wood
well
its
in
there
anyway
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
slammer
damn
good
brown
ale
o
a
fantastic
beer
roast
flavors
are
mellowed
e
g
not
burnt
and
blend
well
with
the
cocoa
wished
it
was
always
available
and
i
lived
in
minneapolis
anyways
go
to
the
taproom
whenever
this
is
on
if
you
like
bender
or
coffee
bender
this
takes
it
to
the
next
level
first
time
trying
this
one
on
tap
at
the
brewery
had
moes
many
times
and
all
except
the
last
time
in
which
it
was
syrupy
and
cloying
it
was
a
superb
beer
that
managed
to
be
so
flavorful
at
such
a
low
abv
anyway
this
similar
version
to
moe
without
the
wood
aging
is
also
a
fantastic
beer
tons
of
flavor
yet
not
filling
and
easy
to
drink
multiples
of
rich
cocoa
powder
flavor
on
top
of
the
already
solid
coffee
taste
and
the
rich
roasted
malt
backbone
of
bender
with
a
fair
amount
of
vanilla
to
top
it
off
this
is
so
tasty
the
mouthfeel
on
this
version
is
lighter
than
moes
but
still
has
a
rich
silky
mouthfeel
upfront
that
quickly
dissipates
inviting
that
next
drink
similar
to
moes
i
would
love
to
see
surly
make
more
of
either
one
of
these
beers
just
takes
coffee
bender
to
the
next
level
what
a
beer
that
is
so
flavorful
yet
very
drinkable
o
delicious
and
better
than
their
normal
bender
what
a
great
twist
on
bender
ended
up
ordering
a
second
really
tasty
stuff
overall
a
pretty
good
chocolate
beer
has
the
big
cocoa
taste
you
would
get
from
a
big
chocolate
stout
with
a
smaller
body
and
lower
abv
a
good
session
chocolate

it
sure
would
be
nice
to
see
them
can
this

that
it

do
me
any
good

is

that
is
accented
by

theres
a

flavor
reveals
more
floral

with

the
finish
is
resiny
and
fairly
bitter
notes
of

counter
light
chocolate
initially
theres
a
bit
of
an
offputting
perfumey
character
in
the
aftertaste
not
quite
the
brew
i
remember
too
bitter
and
perfumey
flavor
for
my
liking
the
aftertaste
of
medicinalharsh
bittering
hops
kills
it
for
me
the
body
holds
medium
with
a
nice
crispness
a
good
bite
but
clean
as
well
it
starts
off
with
smoothness
and
gives
it
over
to
the
bite
without
losing
it
some
leafy
dryness
is
felt
from
middle
to
end
but
it
holds
a
good
median
pouts
a
dark
reddishbrown
in
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
some
lacing
was
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
strong
roasted
malts
the
taste
was
well
very
bitter
with
a
harsh
strong
hoppy
aftertaste
which
lingered
for
way
to
long
tried
it
again
a
few
minutes
later
and
wasnt
any
better
at
all
after
two
more
sips
i
had
had
enough
as
it
was
way
to
hoppy
of
a
harsh
bitter
aftertaste
for
me
and
poured
the
rest
out
overall
decently
balanced
fairly
quaffable
and
enjoyable
without
being
amazing
another
brownroastedblack
treatment
of
an
ipa
enough
all
fucking
ready
the
brown
alestout
essences
just
dont
mesh
all
that
well
with
the
saucy
zippy
nature
of
a
wellwrought
hoppy
pale
ale
or
maybe
this
offering
just
approached
this
from
the
diametrically
opposite
angle
o
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
hoppy
bitter
tasty
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz

glass

a
dark

with

with

tastes
of

with
a
slight
maltiness
beer
is
lightmedium
bodied
and
good
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
a
brew
that
i
did
not
really
enjoy
all
that
much
the
flavors
and
the
nose
never
really
melded
to
well
with
transitions
that
were
somewhat
abrupt
and
disjunct
i
will
likely
not
come
back
to
this
any
time
soon
overall
candidate
for
a
rereview
i
wish
id
noticed
the
freshness
date
before
plucking
it
off
the
shelf
as
is
its
already
a
solid
brew
id
love
to
try
it
fresh
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
i
havent
had
much
in
the
way
of
iba
styled
beers
but
this
would
be
a
good
example
id
take
it
complex
with
that
toasted
nut
and
piney
floral
hop
flavors
but
drinks
easily
excellent
brew
good
stuff

o
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
that
there
are
too
many
clashing
flavors
here
still
its
a
decent
beer
overall
i
just
do
not
like
my
darker
beers
with
this
much
hop
profile
while
is
is
clean
crisp
and
relatively
easy
to
drink
i
just
dont
enjoy
drinking
it
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
especially
for
being
as
old
as
it
is
i
will
need
to
pick
up
a
fresher
version
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
doesnt
quite
jive
well
in
my
opinion
i
think
the
flavors
are
all
there
id
just
add
more
malts
and
raise
the
abv
a
bit
this
is
only
just
above
average
the
nitro
tap
helped
out
the
drinkability
but
the
flavor
isnt
for
me
the
toasty
notes
were
overpowering
i
would
prefer
a
more
up
front
nutty
malty
quality
versus
the
toasted
malts
poured
on
nitrotap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
has
a
great
cascade
of
golden
brown
layers
the
beer
settles
into
a
light
amberbrown
coloring
with
a
dense
low
profile
cream
colored
head
aromas
of
roasty
and
nutty
sweet
characters
with
an
overlay
of
resiny
bright
hops
interesting
dynamic
flavors
are
very
eclectic
and
you
initially
feel
like
they
should
clash
but
they
end
up
blending
very
well
roasty
nutty
and
toffee
sweet
backbone
support
a
bitter
and
floral
hops
profile
that
defiantly
pokes
through
the
strongly
sweet
palate
to
be
represented
this
dichotomy
gives
an
interesting
and
unique
balance
to
the
palate
very
tasty
great
frothy
thick
cling
along
the
glass
as
you
go
the
aftertaste
leans
more
towards
the
sweet
characteristics
of
nut
and
toffee
with
a
creamy
smooth
clean
finish
had
on
tap
at
old
chicago
pretty
good
for
the
style
i
like
even
though
it
is
higher
in
alcohol
it
doesnt
have
that
sickly
sweet
taste
some
of
the
higher
alcohol
brews
have
good
blance
between
caramel
malts
and
hops
i
enjoyed
this
one
would
recommend
it
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
given
its
lightbodied
nature
especially
when
its
on
a
nitrotap
o
its
alright
but
not
sure
how
the
lemon
and
nutty
flavors
contast
its
definitely
a
different
spin
on
a
nut
brown
ale
not
sure
if
would
drink
again
this
was
just
ok
the
aroma
presented
a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
malt
but
the
taste
relayed
a
bit
much
on
the
hops
in
my
opinion
with
a
raw
and
pity
finish
that
didnt
leave
a
favorable
impression
on
me
and
really
took
me
out
of
this
at
times
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
this
up
again
tastetoasted
malt
caramel
citrus
hops
burnt
toast
finish
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
little
brown
o
its
a
decent
beer
but
too
one
note
for
me
to
be
too
interested
in
for
a
regular
beer
i
like
the
stuff
theyre
making
at
boulder
brewery
happy
to
see
this
6pk
sell
for
under
7
bucks
overall
a
mixed
bag
for
me
here
im
starting
to
really
appreciate
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
too
strong
the
6
88
abv
makes
itself
known
not
a
good
session
beer
and
the
overload
of
hops
makes
me
not
want
to
drink
this
again
but
having
said
all
of
that
this
is
a
wellmade
beer
reviewed
on
01152011

overall
impression
seems
to
have
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
tastes
like
an
american
amber
with
elements
of
a
sweet
american
brown
kind
of
a
muddled
mess
avoid
o
great
beer
perfect
cold
weather
beer
for
a
hop
head
a
true
india
brown
ale
reminds
me
of
a
black
ipa
but
not
as
roasted
awesome
value
will
look
for
this
in
the
future
hopefully
fresher
for
more
hops
an
excellent
beer
in
appearance
smell
and
taste
will
have
to
pick
up
more
highly
recommend
conclusion
tasty
and
well
done
i
would
call
this
a
hoppy
amber
or
even
a
black

and
it
leaves
behind
a
thick
sheet
of
lace
all
down
the
glass
this
is
the
most
lace
i
have
ever
seen
a
beer
leave
behind
it
is
just
a
really
great
tasting
creamy
beer
if
you
see
this
try
it
out
but
this
beer
held
up
for
being
an
indian
brown
ale
the
hops
held
their
bitterness
on
the
palate
although
they
were
minimal
in
the
aroma
im
glad
they
made
this
one

more

this

things

no

is

favorite
in

category
if
you
appreciate
the

it
wont
disappoint
something
tastes
like
vanilla
extract
towards
the
end
a
tad
too
sweet
and
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
now
that
im
done
nitpicking
have
to
say
this
is
a
great
beer
i
think
most
beer
lovers
of
any
style
could
appreciate
this
one
you
could
drink
this
year
round
at
14
for
a
six
pack
its
pretty
steep
but
ill
definately
be
buying
this
again
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beers

hazelnuts
where
other
than
that
its
just
an
okay
brown
ale

is

has

what
ever
jeez
drink
this
beer
at
the
end
of
a
long
night
if
you
want
to
barf
weird
wet
dog
smell
more
like
hazelnut
after
it
warmed

color
with
light
body
this
was
just
ok
for
me
smooth
finish
goes
surprisingly
well
with
most
foods
it
was
very
delicious
recommended
for
sure
i
am
a
fan
of
brown
ale
so
i
approached
this
with
a
raised
eyebrow
the
pour
was
a
good
sign
nice
tan
head
not
overly
carbonated
so
far
so
good
this
is
a
great
smelling
beer
if
you
like
hazelnut
the
taste
is
very
nice
reminiscent
of
hazelnut
flavoured
coffee
which
so
popular
in
the
early
1990s
this
is
a
good
beer
for
sure
but
im
not
sure
if
it
is
any
better
than
other
traditional
browns
like
moose
drool
it
has
a
very
good
aroma
look
amber
typical
for
a
brown
ale
but
nice
hues
smell
terrific
roasted
hazelnut
such
a
warm
aroma
i
love
it
taste
very
good
light
not
bitter
very
malty
nice
hazelnut
flavor
goes
with
aroma
real
good
stuff
here
feel
good
a
tiny
bit
watery
some
warmth
not
extremely
carbonated
fairly
refreshing
for
a
brown
ale
try
it
for
sure
very
smooth
delicious
beer
im
constantly
surprised
by
the
mellow
aftertaste
many
beers
of
similar
color
have
bitter
finishes
this
one
is
much
more
polished
one
of
the
best
aromas
you
will
experience
in
a
beer
really
nutty
and
a
great
relaxing
beer
pours
a
hazy
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
a
good
12
finger
foamy
head
that
finally
settles
down
to
a
2mm
or
so
layer
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
that
leaves
some
small
circle
spots
that
stick
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
hazelnuts
with
some
brown
sugar
bit
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
the
hazelnuts
and
malts
are
right
up
front
with
the
sip
followed
by
some
light
caramel
malts
lots
of
flavor
and
goes
down
easy

very

lots

great

cant

enough

after

will
be
drinking
again
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
brews
have
been
to
portland
twice
for
vacation
and
visited
the
brewery
many
many
times
was
lucky
enough
to
catch
a
garage
sale
there
where
they
were
selling
kegs
and
boxes
of
the
22oz
bottles
of
various
rogue
ales
for
great
discounts
i
picked
up
3
cases
of
the
22oz
hazelnut
brown
nectar
while
there
and
was
set
for
beer
outside
of
bars
all
vacation
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
in
to
craft
beer
and
my
love
for
brown
and
nutty
ales
this
beer
is
outstanding
very
smooth
and
detect
no
alcohol
a
tasty
treat
the
taste
is
superb
my
alltime
favorite
rogue
very
nice
smell
of
hazelnuts
but
too
much
carbonization
what
often
bothers
me
with
rogue
ales
some
artificial
flavors
on
the
nose
but
overall
a
tasty
brew
for
a
cold
december
evening
overall
i
say
this
was
a
decent
american
brown
ale
i
might
have
this
again
not
the
biggest
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
different
very
smooth
taste
nice
thick
khaki
head
and
feels
great
on
the
tongue
the
hazelnut
aroma
is
intoxicating
but
the
overall
taste
and
finish
of
this
beer
lacks
like
i
said
overall
good
just
nothing
amazing
o
excellent
beer
thoroughly
infused
in
hazelnut
but
not
too
sugary
or
roasted
a
robust
and
complex
balance
of
flavors
ive
heard
so
many
things
about
this
beer
all
positive
all
completely
spot
on
amazing
brown
ale
absolutely
nutty
hazelnut
in
full
effect
great
everyone
loves
it
amazing
mmm
hazelnuts
that
is
what
this
beer
is
all
about
if
you
like
hazelnuts
you
should
like
this
expert
craftsmanship
by
rogue
follows
in
the
beer
overall
buy
it
o
a
very
good
brown
ale
that
has
great
flavors
and
complexity
this
drinks
very
easily
as
well
if
you
like
brown
ales
this
one
is
sure
to
be
a
winner
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
which
is
saying
something
considering
im
not
all
that
fond
of
brown
ales
toasted
hazelnut
with
notes
of
bittersweet
chocolate
incredibly
smooth
incredibly
tasty
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
brown
ale
i
mean
you
want
be
blown
away
by
it
but
you
will
be
satisfied
and
with
the
hazelnut
finish
it
lets
it
stand
a
little
taller
than
other
browns
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
a
different
take
on
the
brown
ale
which
was
quite
pleasant
and
quaffable
i
would
purchase
again
though
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
beer
reminds
me
of
syrupy
flat
coke
thin
mouth
feel
and
weak
flavors
minimal
hazelnut
pours
an
amzing
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
decent
head
and
lacing
not
a
lot
aroma
is
not
exceptionally
strong
but
the
nuttiness
and
male
sweetness
comes
across
quite
well
and
subtlely
taste
has
a
bit
of
bitter
kick
to
it
but
balances
pretty
well
with
the
roasted
malts
and
nuts
good
brown
ale
that
is
drinkable
and
not
overpowering
o
very
good
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
the
down
falls
of
this
beer
is
that
the
mouth
feel
is
very
watery
definitely
try
this
one

was

the

was

i
was

drinking
beers
that
are
a

more

maybe
im
just
not

dont
know
i
would
drink
it
again
i
just
wouldnt
be
in
any
hurry
to
do
so
an
imperial
xmas
version
of
this
would
be
rocking
some
spices
and
higher
abv
rogue
are
you
listening
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
yardhouse
last
night
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
strong
nutty
taste
to
it
it
had
a
fruit
taste
to
it
although
its
hard
to
identify
what
it
is
i
have
to
say
i
like
it
very
much
i
have
had
a
couple
of
rogue
beers
with
mixed
luck
but
i
would
say
this
is
second
best
to
the
chocolate
stout
at
6
2abv
i
would
say
its
a
semifunctional
beer
give
it
a
try
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brewsweet
but
with
a
very
mild
hop
character
appropriate
for
a
brown
that
said
i
feel
like
i
could
probably
grab
any
decent
brown
add
a
little
hazelnut
extract
which
as
they
state
on
the
bottle
is
how
they
get
the
hazelnut
flavor
and
end
up
with
basically
exactly
this
o
3
75
there
is
no
sense
of
alcohol
i
would
guess
5
5
abv
this
is
a
sweet
and
mellow
bodied
beer
it
has
a
unique
flavor
profile
the
flavor
is
robust
and
caramelized
i
really
liked
it
smooth
light
with
a
nutty
sweet
taste
nice
smooth
beer
tastes
well
refreshing
i
would
feel
pretty
good
about
giving
this
to
my
friends
at
a
party
its
not
the
best
beer
but
will
holds
its
ground
i
will
have
this
again
clear
mahogany
pour
with
a
one
finger
beige
head
with
decent
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
earthy
and
nutty
with
hints
of
caramel
brown
sugar
hazelnut
and
subtle
cocoa
the
taste
is
toasty
and
nutty
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
caramel
hazelnut
coffee
burnt
toast
vanilla
tea
and
subtle
cocoa
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
slightly
elevated
carbonation
but
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
overall
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
and
worth
revisiting
havent
had
this
one
in
over
five
years
so
its
as
good
a
time
as
any
to
return
beer
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
tan
head
nice
nutty
aroma
with
hints
of
coffee
sweet
flavor
on
the
palette
but
not
too
sweet
nutty
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
smooth
and
unobtrusive
mouth
feel
an
outstanding
beer
in
an
under
appreciated
style
would
definitely
recommend
anytime
but
especially
as
a
lighter
desert
style
beer
o
an
excellent
brown
ale
lots
of
nuts
and
chocolate
would
highly
recommend
it
overall
awesome
brown
ale
will
be
enjoying
this
one
again
in
the
near
future
overall
its
probably
my
favorite
rogue
beer
and
is
drink
it
again
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
the
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
very
thick
head
the
smell
is
great
with
sweet
notes
from
the
malt
paired
with
the
earthy
tones
from
the
hazelnuts
the
taste
is
great
with
such
a
delicious
combination
of
sweetness
and
heavy
nuttiness
it
works
well
as
both
a
desert
beer
as
well
as
something
to
drink
with
spicy
food
the
mouthfeel
is
just
the
right
thickness
for
me
has
a
big
body
but
is
not
syrupy
love
this
one
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
and
great
lacing
aroma
is
hazelnut
and
chocolate
taste
is
a
basically
the
same
as
the
aroma
great
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definitely
buy
again
overallvery
good
beer
thats
perfect
for
those
with
a
sweet
tooth
when
it
comes
to
beers
personally
this
is
too
sweet
for
me
to
frequently
have
but
it
certainly
will
be
a
top
choice
for
a
dessert
beer
in
the
future
not
a
bad
drop
but
expected
more
from
a
rogue
beer
after
tasting
their
chocolate
stout
will
definitely
be
buying
more
of
their
beers
just
not
this
one
if
you
like
hazelnut
coffe
or
happen
to
like
hazelnuts
in
general
this
is
your
beer
it
has
a
very
clean
looking
appearance
medium
brown
color
with
a
sweet
and
flavorful
head
it
is
very
nutty
the
hazelnut
flavor
doesnt
start
or
finish
the
beer
it
is
the
beer
a
very
sweet
beer
if
that
s
not
your
thing
look
elsewhere
not
bitter
at
any
point
smooth
nutty
sweet
throughout
this
is
an
amazing
beer
could
have
one
with
your
oatmeal
or
your
pork
chops
delicious
dark
amber
in
appearance
with
a
short
lived
head
nose
of
cooked
sugar
rc
cola
dark
fruit
like
figs
and
dates
nutty
flavors
apparent
with
roasted
character
and
caramel
notes
up
front
hop
flavor
is
muted
and
mild
with
a
very
clean
bitterness
showing
up
at
the
end
thin
bodied
and
mildly
carbonated
i
swear
to
god
i
like
christmas
cookies
with
this
better
than
egg
nog
o
a
nice
brown
ale
but
perhaps
not
worth
the
trouble
of
seeking
it
out
at
a
specialty
store
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
from
the
first
swallow
overall
a
brilliant
beer
full
of
chocolatehazelnut
goodness
pure
deliciousness
pours
a
nice
brown
with
a
thick
head
i
for
the
life
of
me
cant
detect
any
hazelnut
smell
at
all
although
the
taste
is
good
for
a
brown
ale
i
cant
detect
any
hazelnut
taste
or
flavor
at
all
although
its
highly
rated
here
im
not
sure
why
the
big
letdown
for
me
is
the
lack
of
any
hazelnut
rjt
d
a
nice
and
toasty
brown
with
good
balance
and
some
subtle
flavor
additions
i
particularly
appreciate
the
restrained
approach
here
this
may
in
fact
be
one
of
rogues
better
offerings
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
rogue
some
folk
seem
to
really
dig
this
beer
too
sweet
imo
pours
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
smells
of
hazelnut
malt
hop
and
light
cocoa
tasting
the
beer
the
first
thing
that
strikes
me
is
the
hazelnut
and
malt
it
finishes
with
a
hop
and
malt
taste
with
a
good
mouth
feel
a
really
good
brown
ale
and
i
would
buy
again
probably
my
second
favorite
brown
ale
the
hazelnut
favor
is
very
prominent
both
in
the
smell
and
on
the
pallet
it
might
be
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
some
people
but
its
a
great
brown
a
nice
honey
flavor
can
also
be
detected
as
always
let
it
warm
up
a
little
from
ice
cold
and
itll
really
blossom
in
flavor
and
smell
love
the
mouthfeel
also
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
and
a
flavor
that
doesnt
stay
forever
in
your
mouth
o
at
first
sip
this
one
was
surprisingly
plain
but
as
it
warmed
up
the
flavour
came
out
and
i
quite
enjoyed
it
i
dont
know
that
i
will
pick
another
up
in
a
bottle
but
i
would
like
to
give
it
a
try
on
tap
one
day
oa
great
brew
from
oregon
it
is
simple
yet
tasty
and
goes
down
easily
remarks
not
bad
but
not
that
impressive
either
best
finish
best
brown
ale
i
have
had
it
on
tap
and
bottle
rogue
just
makes
great
beers
the
finish
on
this
beer
and
aroma
stick
with
you
some
brown
ales
can
be
quite
bland
not
the
case
here
smooth
beer
i
could
buy
a
keg
of
this
daily
drinker
the
nut
flavor
is
just
right
mouthfeel
is
light
slightly
gritty
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
12oz
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
aggressively
about
11
5
head
that
didnt
especially
retain
lacing
there
but
on
the
minimal
side
that
might
just
be
my
opinion
based
on
how
hoppy
the
beers
i
have
been
drinking
recently
are
dark
brown
this
ale
is
not
translucent
in
the
slightest
didnt
get
much
on
the
smell
however
the
taste
i
remembered
being
not
quite
as
delicious
as
this
the
last
time
i
tried
it
the
hazelnut
is
coming
through
really
nicely
and
for
not
having
enjoyed
a
beer
this
dark
in
a
while
i
am
pretty
happy
with
this
one
malty
sweetness
with
the
hazelnut
flavor
is
just
divine
and
its
backed
by
a
nice
hop
presence
carbonation
was
meh
no
freshness
date
on
this
bottle
probably
the
only
drawback
to
rogue
a
great
ale
can
see
why
it
is
so
popular
lovely
brown
ale
with
a
malty
and
nutty
profile
and
not
shy
in
flavors
hazelnut
notes
are
light
and
it
does
not
seem
artificial
i
had
preferred
the
john
john
version
though
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
definitely
recommend
trying
it
if
you
havent
smell
is
incredible
like
honey
nut
cheerios
on
steroids
tastes
almost
as
good
as
the
smell
an
impressive
brown
ale
the
taste
was
extremely
pleasant
a
later
of
sweet
coffeehazelnutvanilla
with
a
touch
of
caramel
none
of
which
were
overpowering
however
for
a
brown
ale
the
body
was
a
bit
thin
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
feel
and
drinkability
while
the
aroma
and
flavoring
were
both
nicely
inclusive
rich
in
depth
and
agreeable
what
really
stood
out
was
how
quickly
it
disappeared
from
our
glasses
all
of
the
notes
you
would
expect
to
be
there
are
easily
found
with
sweet
and
sour
brown
malts
chocolate
roast
and
rich
hazelnut
extract
these
are
found
repeatedly
across
the
spectrums
of
both
aroma
and
taste
and
are
consistent
throughout
the
tasting
then
the
slurp
hits
you
it
is
velour
popping
like
cotton
pulling
each
sip
further
down
into
bubbly
ease
and
happiness
this
helps
to
make
up
for
slightly
lesser
explosiveness
in
the
aforementioned
arenas
keeping
it
flowing
and
extremely
drinkable
this
is
a
great
easy
beer
for
the
style
and
one
weve
really
enjoyed
this
is
a
very
distinctive
brown
ale
and
will
appeal
to
anyone
who
likes
sweeter
beers
the
deep
ruby
brown
brew
carried
hints
of
a
buttery
nuttiness
on
the
nose
that
followed
into
the
flavor
this
was
a
simple
full
flavored
beer
that
melted
on
the
palate
rather
than
attack
it
rogue
created
a
rich
and
rewarding
brown
ale
that
mixed
perfectly
with
the
toasted
buttery
hazelnut
flavors
there
is
nothing
huge
or
complicated
about
it
but
it
is
a
smooth
and
wonderful
concoction
that
earns
the
right
to
be
call
itself
a
nectar
hops
are
relatively
low
well
basically
nonexistent
actually
thats
fine
though
as
i
dont
think
theyd
add
much
here
the
body
doesnt
quite
match
the
flavors
id
like
things
to
be
a
bit
thicker
but
maybe
im
asking
for
too
much
from
a
6
2
abv
brown
ale
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
very
good
one
either
even
minus
the
oxidation
the
flavors
werent
working
for
me
the
way
they
seem
to
be
for
others
wouldve
liked
a
touch
more
hazelnut
and
a
bit
more
sweetness
id
like
to
try
it
again
unoxidized
but
i
wont
be
rushing
to
get
another
overall
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
from
this
one
it
had
a
good
idea
but
i
am
not
the
biggest
rogue
fan
turns
out
its
pretty
decent
wish
there
was
more
roasty
malts
and
less
coffee
overall
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
brown
ale
here
from
rogue
a
lot
of
their
stuff
seems
to
be
hit
or
miss
but
this
is
one
worth
trying
overall
a
nice
quaff
that
utilizes
molasses
bready
and
hazelnut
flavors
to
deliver
a
very
drinkable
and
delicious
drink
an
interesting
beer
to
pair
with
food
because
of
nuttysweetbready
flavors
taste
wise
though
it
starts
out
sweet
nutty
with
a
taste
of
honey
but
turns
bitter
more
like
an
esb
than
i
would
care
to
have
with
such
a
malty
start
there
is
a
little
puckering
of
the
tongue
at
this
for
mouthfeel
but
overall
it
doesnt
suit
my
tastes
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
love
the
look
smell
and
taste
would
definitely
buydrink
again

under
the
specialty

category
i
really
enjoyed
the
color
the
brown
ale
style
and
the
compliment
of
the
hazelnut
flavor
this
would
be
the
first
i
tried
with
the
hazelnut
flavor
and
had
mixed
opinion
at
first
but
after
trying
i
would
highly
recommend
and
definitely
keep
my
eyeout
to
try
again
this
is
a
great
beer
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
as
a
winter
seasonal
i
would
highly
recommend
and
buy
again

tastes
of

that
much
is
nailed
tastes
has
addl
sweet
malt
character
very
nutty
with
even
bitterness
feels
about
light
to
medium
overall
an
excellent
spice
or
whatever
kind
of
beer
you
classify
this
great
tasting
and
well
balanced
all
around
d
outside
of
the
initial
appearance
this
beer
has
it
all
it
is
full
flavored
and
very
well
balanced
with
the
hazelnut
flavor
at
just
the
right
amount
the
alcohol
is
essentially
nonexistent
and
is
so
sleek
on
the
palate
i
will
most
definitely
purchase
this
again
and
highly
recommend
this
beer
rouge
has
put
their
spin
on
the
brown
ale
style
and
more
than
hit
a
home
run
with
this
overall
im
starting
to
think
i
must
not
like
brown
ales
in
general
i
tasted
the
same
gross
green
taste
in
bbc
nut
brown
ale
newcastle
is
very
average
and
i
cant
remember
having
any
others
t
first
strikes
me
with
balanced
malt
and
the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
with
just
a
hint
of
earth
nice
woody
after
taste
mid
palate
there
is
nice
dark
fruit
fig
or
plum
after
my
first
couple
of
sips
i
thought
it
might
be
too
much
for
a
bomber
but
it
surprisingly
drinks
very
smoothly
this
was
a
fun
beer
to
run
into
so
earthy
and
malty
i
keep
looking
for
hazelnut
however
even
without
it
this
is
a
killer
beer
very
impressive
o
good
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
am
really
disappointed
with
this
one
i
love
me
some
hazelnuts
aka
filberts
and
browns
are
a
favorite
style
but
i
know
rogue
is
a
crap
shoot
when
i
bought
it
been
drinking
their
stuff
for
10
years
or
more
i
had
voodoo
maple
bacon
again
last
week
so
good
and
ive
got
a
bomber
of
voodoo
chocolate
peanut
butter
banana
chilling
for
a
couple
of
weeks
from
now
the
shakespeare
festiveale
chocolate
double
choc
stouts
dead
guy
and
glen
were
great
too
the
american
amber
xs
imp
porter
were
very
far
from
the
rest
are
middling
offerings
but
with
such
high
ratings
from
over
2000
people
i
expected
better
from
this
one
ive
two
more
bottles
sitting
in
the
fridge
if
they
prove
better
ill
gladly
amend
this
review
like
always
but
if
your
still
looking
at
this
in
sept
2013
or
beyond
they
were
just
as
bad
o
nutty
and
sweet
flavors
are
perfectly
bold
given
the
light
body
and
drinkability
fantastic
balance
of
flavor
and
feel
overall
a
great
beer
one
of
my
go
to
overall
very
good
beer
light
and
sweet
and
something
id
enjoy
having
two
or
three
of
id
consider
keeping
this
is
the
fridge
for
regular
rotation
o
not
bad
but
sort
of
a
one
note
song
lacks
the
depth
a
brown
should
have
good
brown
with
an
odd
overpowering
scent
easy
to
drink
otherwise
with
a
nutty
hazelnut
sweetness
throughout
o
a
very
nice
brown
ale
the
hazelnut
isnt
overpowering
cloying
or
sweet
it
fits
well
with
the
style
and
is
a
seamless
blend
im
not
a
big
brown
ale
person
and
the
feels
and
tastes
of
the
style
are
not
my
typical
preference
that
said
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
appealed
in
all
areas
a
fan
of
the
style
would
no
doubt
enjoy
this
beer
tremendously
overall
an
excellent
beer
rich
flavour
nice
look
smell
that
lives
up
to
its
name
i
may
just
have
to
buy
another
bottle
despite
the
price
well
done
rogue
well
done
o
a
pretty
solid
offering
from
rogue
and
a
staple
brown
ale
that
is
easily
accessible
and
priced
reasonably
this
is
a
good
beer
for
someone
who
has
gotten
past
gateway
craft
and
wants
some
of
the
typical
examples
of
american
styles
o
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
for
a
while
being
a
big
fan
of
brown
ales
and
malty
beverages
this
was
delicious
a
decent
flavored
nut
brown
beer
but
nothing
i
want
to
revisit
again
really
o
good
beer
overall
should
get
one
more
22
ounce
bottle
into
signature
pint
glass
no
bottle
dating
pours
slightly
hazy
deep
reddish
copper
color
with
a
12
finger
fairly
dense
cream
colored
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
light
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
aromas
of
big
caramel
hazelnut
chocolate
toffee
brown
sugar
toast
brown
bread
light
floral
and
toasted
earthiness
damn
nice
aromas
with
great
balance
and
complexity
of
the
malt
notes
with
the
big
hazelnut
presence
taste
of
big
caramel
toast
toffee
chocolate
brown
sugar
hazelnut
brown
bread
light
floral
and
toasted
earthiness
no
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
lingering
notes
of
caramel
chocolate
toast
toffee
brown
sugar
hazelnut
and
brown
bread
on
the
finish
for
a
short
bit
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
flavors
with
only
a
moderate
amount
of
hazelnut
not
nearly
as
robust
in
flavor
as
i
expected
from
the
aromas
and
no
cloying
sweetness
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
lightly
slick
mouthfeel
that
was
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
flavored
brown
ale
good
balance
and
complexity
of
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
may
have
been
an
old
bottle
but
there
is
no
way
to
know
for
sure
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
this
is
well
crafted
and
tastes
of
smooth
hazelnut
with
sufficient
malt
will
buy
again
i
will
be
having
this
one
again
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
nice
medium
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
aroma
showed
a
hint
of
hazelnut
and
sweetness
the
taste
was
the
awesome
surprise
as
a
huge
blast
of
true
hazelnut
comes
through
and
then
mellows
on
the
taste
bud
into
a
nice
full
brown
ale
creamy
and
nutty
with
mild
sweetness
for
the
mouthfeel
overall
an
awesome
brew
i
would
grab
this
again
anytime
o
nice
flavored
brown
ale
one
of
my
favorites
from
rogue
unique
ale
but
not
overdone
like
some
that
the
produce
it
has
a
nice
finish
and
great
carbonation
one
of
my
first
rogue
beers
and
quite
good
for
a
brown
ale
i
wish
more
had
this
distinct
character
served
in
a
standard
shaker
at
the
saucer
pours
a
deep
pretty
brown
color
with
some
ruby
hues
and
limited
light
penetration
it
lacks
any
head
to
speak
of
and
leaves
no
lacing
to
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
good
strong
sweet
malt
with
some
woody
earthy
hops
undertones
it
has
a
strong
smell
of
toasted
cereal
and
just
a
hint
of
that
hazelnut
the
flavor
is
just
too
much
hazelnut
to
me
the
hops
do
a
good
job
of
cutting
down
the
double
whammy
of
malty
sweetness
and
the
hazelnut
which
in
this
case
tastes
almost
like
starbucks
hazelnut
syrup
has
been
added
finishes
dry
with
a
pretty
good
palate
feel
i
hesitated
to
review
this
beer
due
to
my
growing
distaste
for
hazelnut
purely
because
im
sick
of
all
the
flavored
syrups
at
coffee
bars
therefore
i
really
tried
to
review
this
one
with
the
style
in
mind
first
of
all
and
my
palate
second
of
all
which
is
what
i
try
to
do
no
matter
what
i
even
when
back
for
a
second
round
just
to
finalize
my
thoughts
i
really
think
that
overall
the
hazelnut
was
just
too
much
and
overwhelmed
the
natural
malt
goodness
of
a
good
brown
anyhow
great
beer
and
deservedly
regarded
as
a
classic
hazelnut
brown
nectar
nicely
melds
hazelnut
and
brown
ale
flavors
its
a
bit
pricey
for
a
bomber
but
once
you
crack
it
open
its
hard
to
stop
drinking
until
the
bottles
empty
o
overall
the
beer
smelled
good
before
tasting
but
after
tasting
the
cloying
hazelnut
flavor
became
overbearing
about
four
sips
in
by
13
of
the
way
through
i
found
the
unrelenting
concentrated
nut
flavor
to
be
somewhat
nauseating
sink
poured
the
rest
was
expecting
a
lot
more
given
the
hype
really
seemed
to
lack
subtlety
in
favor
of
hey
we
put
nuts
in
this
beer
would
consider
giving
it
another
go
but
not
anytime
soon
and
not
over
7
a
bomber
great
beer
for
what
it
is
fruity
character
and
over
the
top
diacetyl
are
a
little
overwhelming
but
well
represented
malt
and
nut
character
not
cloying
a
guilty
pleasure
brew
overall
this
brew
gets
a
majority
of
my
recommendations
for
the
in
between
drinkers
o
a
slow
sipper
due
to
the
sweetness
would
make
a
good
dessert
beer
but
definitely
couldnt
do
more
than
12ounces
solid
hazelnut
brown
ale
overall
i
dont
know
what
the
fuss
is
about
this
beer
this
does
a
major
nothing
for
me
i
like
brown
ale
but
even
the
crappy
browm
ales
has
more
taste
then
this
and
it
sticks
in
the
back
of
your
thoart
so
i
dont
see
why
this
isa
good
beer
what
a
disappiont
here
o
not
particularly
likable
aside
from
the
aroma
im
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
of
these
and
wouldnt
buy
it
again
having
said
that
its
a
good
choice
for
hazelnut
lovers
because
lets
face
it
the
flavor
is
nothing
but
that
if
this
and
frangelic
mountain
brown
have
taught
me
anything
its
that
hazelnut
beers
give
off
great
aromatic
qualities
and
not
so
great
flavor
profiles
get
some
its
good
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
seems
to
lightly
coat
the
back
half
of
the
tongue
and
makes
you
salivate
waiting
for
the
next
sip
being
a
hazelnut
lover
i
tried
to
ignore
all
the
reviews
slamming
this
beers
artificial
hazelnut
flavoring
i
really
wanted
to
enjoy
it
i
did
anyway
i
thought
it
was
a
good
beer
a
nice
dark
amber
with
the
slight
feel
of
a
porter
and
a
hefty
hint
of
hazelnut
artificial
or
not
i
will
drink
it
again
rogue
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
selection
was
not
for
me
o
a
good
beer
to
have
on
hand
especially
if
you
love
the
taste
of
hazelnut
a
solid
brew
a
very
solidly
crafted
hazelnut
brew
pick
one
up
of
you
like
nutty
beers
if
not
you
probably
wont
enjoy
this
one

very

a
generous

smell
is
a
blend
of
carmel
brown
sugar
roasted
malts
and
nuts
very
inviting
taste
follows
the
nose
and
adds
a
level
of
complexity
that
makes
this
beer
special
the
carmel
notes
on
the
front
give
way
to
a
nutty
coffee
roasted
malts
flavor
that
is
spot
on
a
nice
hop
finish
and
this
one
is
tough
to
set
down
feel
is
spot
on
as
well
creamy
silky
on
the
tongue
and
the
perfect
level
of
carbonation
overall
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
brown
i
have
had
great
combination
of
malts
nuts
carmel
sugar
and
hops
so
easy
to
drink
very
sessionable
and
a
great
effort
from
rogue

dryer

very
good
hazelnut
notes
pairing
well
with
the
very
light
chocolate
not
particularly
bold
in
the
flavor
but
not
completely
watered
down
finish
lingers
in
a
way
that
i
dont
like
a
bit
of
a
stale
aftertaste
overall
a
decent
brown
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
maybe
nice
medium
mouth
feel
with
a
smooth
soft
carbonation
o
the
natural
hazelnut
is
really
what
makes
this
beer
great
well
rounded
brew
o
an
extremely
balanced
and
complex
beer
a
great
blend
of
malt
sweetness
and
nuttiness
a
delicious
dessert
beer
one
of
my
favorite
takes
on
an
american
brown
ale
overall
i
really
good
beer
that
i
would
like
to
have
on
hand
for
whenever
the
mood
strikes
its
not
something
that
id
want
to
drink
all
night
long
but
a
its
a
nice
tasty
change
of
pace
beer
o
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
id
seek
out
im
not
a
huge
hazelnut
fan
in
general
though
i
got
this
beer
in
a
raffle
probably
wouldnt
have
picked
it
out
from
a
store
its
a
lovely
experience
and
one
of
which
i
think
i
would
never
tire
a
very
predominantly
nutty
brown
ale
the
unique
roasted
nut
note
is
pretty
much
the
star
here
reducing
everything
else
to
faint
hints
the
flavor
is
to
my
liking
but
i
found
it
just
a
tad
too
dominant
i
wouldve
love
some
more
balance
here
nevertheless
a
good
solid
brew
its
a
good
substitute
for
coffee
beers
sipping
one
away
amongst
intelligent
conversation
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
tastes
exactly
as
advertised
rogue
is
one
of
the
best
brewers
in
the
nation
for
a
reason
this
beer
is
just
another
example
bravo
overall
this
was
a
wonderful
beer
one
id
recommend
and
would
seek
out
again

and
enjoyable
brew
ayemcshane
on
twitter
overall
its
what
i
expected
when
i
purchased
it
which
is
an
accomplishment
in
that
sense
it
tastes
good
has
a
decent
abv
and
can
be
had
in
more
than
one
at
a
time
slight
flavoring
bitterness
in
the
end
taste
but
it
is
minimal
22oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
really
nutty
with
some
caramel
malts
hazelnut
and
hints
of
coffee
the
flavor
is
earthy
and
nutty
almost
has
a
bit
of
a
caramel
popcorn
taste
to
it
hazelnut
is
more
present
at
the
end
coffee
finish
creamy
mouthfeel
pretty
nice
twist
on
the
style
overall
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
out
there
o
not
the
bold
brown
that
i
anticipated
but
thats
just
fine
this
was
unique
nicely
executed
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
an
extremely
enjoyable
beer
and
one
that
would
be
great
with
dessert
its
great
that
it
is
not
too
sweet
with
the
presence
of
the
chocolate
and
hazelnut
one
i
need
to
have
more
often
wow
let
me
repeat
that
wow
i
have
just
found
the
same
experience
that
i
had
when
i
first
bit
into
a
piece
of
toast
with
nutella
on
it
for
a
fan
of
the
hazelnut
this
is
the
equivalent
of
a
finding
dark
brown
gold
in
a
little
12
oz
bottle
if
you
like
a
beer
with
a
distinguished
nut
taste
look
no
further
you
will
not
find
a
better
beer
did
i
mention
this
beer
is
good
my
taste
buds
liked
hazelnut
brown
from
sam
adams
so
i
decided
to
try
this
one
out
and
i
couldnt
be
happier
with
that
choice
suddenly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
pint
in
a
session
but
good
lord
this
is
fantastic
for
desserty
beer
fans
this
is
jam
packed
with
hazelnut
good
change
of
pace
in
the
world
of
brown
ales
bought
a
bottle
of
this
from
m
r
liquors
in
manchester
ct
poured
into
a
baird
pint
glass
mysterious
cloudy
brown
hue
a
playful
hazelnut
and
maple
syrup
nose
hints
at
the
powerful
hazelnut
and
hop
flavor
in
the
brew
silky
smooth
caramel
aftertaste
with
a
bit
of
bitter
toffee
as
well
this
is
an
amazing
fallwinter
brew
that
matches
with
the
changing
leaves
outside
making
me
reminisce
on
the
whole
experience
as
far
as
brown
ales
go
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
not
being
overly
hazelnutdriven
and
definitely
sticking
to
its
category
definitely
a
recommendation
sessionable
not
overdone
subtle
and
tasty
a
nice
match
for
an
aged
hunk
of
gouda
o
great
mouthfeel
and
some
really
good
flavors
but
also
some
offflavors
the
aroma
on
this
beer
was
pretty
foul
too
if
you
have
ever
spilled
beer
on
the
carpet
and
waited
too
long
to
clean
it
up
that
aroma
comes
through
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
kind
of
stale
stinky
beer
character
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
but
it
is
only
memorable
because
of
the
hazelnut
flavor
and
the
hazelnuts
are
not
even
very
aggressive
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
but
i
certainly
do
not
feel
an
urge
to
go
out
and
buy
bombers
o
good
brown
ale
with
complex
flavors
but
a
little
too
light
bodied
i
enjoyed
trying
this
beer
but
it
is
not
something
that
i
would
drink
frequently
overall
a
very
good
brown
and
one
worth
buying
again
drinkability
is
very
high
for
the
entirety
of
this
16
oz
pint
but
i
dont
think
i
could
solely
session
this
all
night
as
the
sweetness
would
overwhelm
me
eventually
otherwise
absolutely
delicious
overall
this
is
a
gem
moving
up
my
list
of
favorites
it
is
a
tad
thin
and
unassuming
but
is
so
damn
flavorful
and
satisfying
that
it
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
give
me
another
barkeep
if
you
love
hazelnut
like
i
do
you

poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
an
interesting
dark
redorange
amber
with
a
moderate
head
and
lacing
strong
hazelnut
and
malt
start
and
middle
with
some
astringent
hopping
and
dry
finish
a
bit
more
sweetness
wouldnt
hurt
but
still
a
pleasant
nutty
brown
ale
nice
when
rogue
nails
it
they
really
nail
it
this
is
a
totally
unique
totally
fantastic
beer
the
hazelnut
smell
is
strong
but
the
flavor
is
wellbalanced
and
light
in
a
good
way
as
such
its
an
all
weather
beer
that
stands
alone
one
of
our
local
pubs
has
a
constantly
rotating
tap
but
this
one
has
stayed
on
as
long
as
ive
been
going
there
its
a
flavorful
beer
but
because
its
not
overwhelmingly
bold
its
a
great
beer
to
pass
off
to
your
friends
especially
those
who
often
reach
for
a
newcastle
o
maybe
its
just
my
palate
because
this
beer
got
really
good
reviews
and
i
do
really
enjoy
the
aroma
and
flavor
but
i
just
think
this
beer
would
be
great
if
it
were
bold
allaround
i
wish
it
had
all
of
the
nose
taste
and
mouthfeel
except
intensified
a
lot
that
said
brown
ales
and
stouts
are
kind
of
mah
thang
i
recently
had
dfh
palo
santo
indian
brown
which
are
both
humongous
browns
in
body
flavor
aroma
and
booze
i
would
almost
call
palo
santo
a
stoutso
i
might
just
still
be
in
a
different
element
but
yeah
this
just
needs
some
thickening
overall
i
dont
get
all
of
the
hatred
for
rogue
too
pricey
yes
but
this
is
just
another
awesome
selection
and
it
held
up
to
my
expectations
im
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
sixer
for
12
but
the
single
for
2
79
was
exceptional
o
this
is
a
worldclass
nut
brown
ale
not
to
be
missed
by
any
beer
aficionado
this
is
an
easydrinking
beer
ill
be
recommending
to
others
this
might
actually
be
comparable
to
ccb
maduro
very
translucent
brown
body
it
smells
dry
and
full
of
hazelnut
slightly
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
just
right
for
a
brown
light
and
sweet
slightly
dry
but
only
enough
to
even
things
out
light
hazelnut
flavor
which
hides
the
sweet
base
finishes
nutty
and
sweet
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
many
of
these
are
boring
and
simple
but
this
one
is
smooth
highly
drinkable
and
complex
one
of
rogues
best
quality
from
rogue
i
knew
they
could
do
it
overall
this
is
a
fine
brown
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
name
if
you
want
a
balance
of
flavors
along
with
sweet
bitter
dry
malt
hops
and
a
warm
alcohol
feeling
in
your
belly
this
brew
is
for
you
cheers
originally
reviewed
10042011
overall
i
was
dreading
drinking
this
beer
its
not
worth
dreading
its
a
rogue
product
and
that
means
what
you
want
it
to
mean
its
tasty
but
not
memorable
o
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
right
up
there
with
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
if
you
enjoy
brown
ales
this
is
a
must
try
o
yuck
i
feel
mollycoddled
by
the
overbearing
hazelnut
but
if
you
like
warming
christmassy
flavours
this
is
for
you
very
sickly
o
rogue
have
well
and
truly
captured
hazelnut
in
a
bottle
here
if
you
really
like
your
hazelnuts
this
could
be
your
go
to
beer
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
chestnut
brown
in
color
with
a
one
finger
creamy
off
white
head
the
nose
is
somewhat
sweet
and
malt
with
a
touch
of
nuttiness
almost
in
a
syrup
type
of
manner
the
flavors
are
a
big
improvement
its
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
toffee
and
light
butterscotch
with
a
lot
of
hazelnut
the
hazelnut
even
flows
into
the
after
taste
and
doesnt
leave
for
a
couple
minutes
it
has
great
great
flavor
for
the
style
it
drinks
light
and
sweet
with
a
subtly
dry
finish
this
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
you
can
find
in
my
opinion
this
beer
may
be
an
acquired
taste
but
if
you
like
coffee
or
nutty
flavors
this
beer
is
for
you
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
standout
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
i
would
juts
like
a
bit
more
fullness
in
the
flavor
worth
a
try
a
nice
variation
on
a
brown
ale
nice
little
brown
ale
good
thing
because
i
was
almost
at
the
point
of
downandout
on
rogue
beer
happy
to
have
this
little
puppy
in
my
pint
glass
4
0
o
an
amazing
beer
very
well
balanced
and
very
nice
as
a
desset
beer
o
ive
only
had
a
couple
of
straight
brown
ales
but
this
is
the
best
yet
im
happy
that
its
not
overly
sweet
like
some
browns
good
stuff
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
the
hazelnuts
are
a
very
welcome
addition
to
the
mix
id
have
another
o
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
to
savor
not
very
complex
but
an
interesting
and
well
made
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
pours
a
see
through
light
brown
mm
color
with
a
lacey
off
white
head
and
an
absolute
ton
of
carbonation
rising
in
the
glass
looks
like
soda
smell
is
amazing
nutty
and
sweet
notes
of
vanilla
roasty
english
malt
and
an
earthy
sort
of
hop
vibe
flavor
is
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
liking
its
sugary
in
the
mouthfeel
too
the
hazelnut
flavor
is
great
though
and
it
adds
a
great
element
to
the
beer
feel
could
be
improved
a
little
less
carbonation
and
a
little
more
body
and
this
would
be
world
class
because
its
got
everything
else
overall
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
but
stil
room
for
improvement
excellent
with
gourmet
pizza
o
this
beer
looked
and
smelled
good
but
seemed
a
bit
lacking
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
for
a
brown
ale
it
just
didnt
seem
like
there
was
enough
malt
the
flavors
didnt
shine
through
right
away
and
it
just
felt
watery
still
a
tasty
beer
but
ive
had
better
brown
ales
cheers
lampertland
o
quite
a
delicious
and
wonderfully
drinkable
brown
ale
hazelnut
is
a
wonderful
addition
and
is
well
balanced
with
the
rest
of
the
malt
i
just
kept
getting
this
strange
taste
as
it
went
down
but
i
only
have
one
12
oz
bottle
so
i
cant
really
further
investigate
with
another
but
it
still
very
tasty
hard
to
rate
from
here
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
there
is
a
nice
complexity
to
the
taste
and
smell
of
the
beer
including
the
inclusion
of
the
hazelnut
definitely
a
beer
i
would
get
again
overall
im
not
really
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
if
youre
crazy
about
hazelnut
maybe
this
is
your
desert
island
beer
for
me
though
theres
just
not
much
here
to
latch
onto
i
almost
feel
like
i
got
a
bad
bottle
because
this
is
just
disappointing
and
meh
its
not
bad
i
was
just
hoping
for
more
overall
it
was
an
alright
brew
the
flavors
werent
the
greatest
as
some
seemed
a
little
bit
artificial
and
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
did
not
seem
to
meld
very
well
doa
overall
as
solid
as
a
brown
ale
that
you
can
find
a
bit
sweet
but
also
very
tasty
would
pair
nicely
with
most
desserts
o
amazing
smell
good
flavor
but
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
a
regular
very
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
only
moderate
so
you
could
easily
sip
this
all
night
another
standout
from
rogue
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
favors
malt
bombs
or
doesnt
care
for
brown
ales
like
me
overall
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
browns
even
throughout
easy
drinking
i
find
most
browns
to
be
overly
sweet
isnt
the
case
with
this
one
let
it
sit
the
warmer
this
beer
gets
the
better
fresh
out
of
the
fridge
the
smell
and
taste
leave
much
to
be
desired
as
it
warms
malty
notes
of
honey
and
hazelnut
move
to
the
forefront
however
not
quite
to
the
strength
id
desire
i
enjoyed
mine
in
a
tulip
glass
not
sure
id
purchase
it
again
but
worth
the
few
dollars
i
spent
at
my
local
trader
joes
overall
not
a
bad
brew
tastes
a
bit
like
coffee
not
very
interesting
to
think
about
though
color
is
dark
brown
the
tan
head
is
well
developed
at
first
but
fades
quickly
while
the
scent
is
a
bit
muted
hazelnut
is
definitely
noticeable
the
taste
is
very
nutty
hazelnut
is
prominent
with
a
slight
sweet
and
roasty
malt
flavor
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
the
weak
point
of
this
beer
its
quite
thin
and
watery
i
can
see
the
strong
nut
flavor
of
this
beer
pairing
well
with
desert
i
will
definitely
be
stocking
this
one
in
the
fridge
regularly
now
that
it
is
not
relegated
to
bombers
hey
rogue
how
about
some
fourpacks
of
the
double
chocolate
stout
please
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
first
had
this
brew
from
a
bottle
so
i
jumped
at
the
chance
to
try
it
on
tap
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
pours
an
ambercaramel
coloring
with
a
low
profile
filmy
small
bubbled
head
that
clings
to
the
edge
of
the
surface
the
nose
is
just
as
amazing
as
i
remember
it
being
in
the
bottle
with
a
creamy
buttery
blend
of
rich
hazelnut
caramel
and
an
overall
roasted
quality
flavors
are
a
light
smooth
blend
of
nutella
and
a
biscuity
backbone
it
almost
tastes
like
caramel
popcorn
soaked
in
a
hazelnut
blended
coffee
super
smooth
flavors
that
remain
light
and
the
crisp
body
make
this
a
ridiculously
easy
drinker
the
aftertaste
is
nutty
and
sweet
with
a
sugary
kiss
at
the
very
end
the
finish
is
subtly
sweet
with
a
sugary
and
rich
hazelnut
linger
that
entices
the
palate
to
continue
drinking
this
is
a
tremendous
beer
and
one
of
the
better
browns
ive
ever
had
very
enjoyable
and
so
easy
to
drink
overall
i
really
like
this
one
its
a
great
standalone
drink
with
the
flavors
it
has
and
its
mellow
enough
to
go
well
with
food
or
dessert
it
may
not
be
the
best
brown
ale
ill
ever
have
but
its
one
i
could
drink
anytime
highly
recommended
to
try
o
i
like
this
beer
but
its
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
brown
ales
i
have
had
like
bells
best
brown
i
think
this
beer
needs
to
be
a
bit
bigger
in
feel
and
along
with
that
a
more
intense
flavor
it
just
felt
a
little
watered
down
to
me
this
was
a
great
beer
enjoyable
to
lok
at
in
the
glass
and
taste
all
the
way
through
good
beer
to
share
with
other
looking
for
a
unique
nutty
brown
ale
plenty
of
smiles
everytime
it
was
tasted
and
shared
highly
recommended
as
a
sit
down
and
enjoy
beer
just
hit
the
top
of
my
brown
ales
list
d
i
was
expecting
something
more
given
the
current
ratings
its
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
like
the
nut
flavor
quite
a
bit
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
a
this
review
was
from
the
bottle
version
but
if
i
get
it
on
tap
again
this
will
be
redone
and
likely
will
increase
a
fine
occasional
beer
and
one
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
though
not
what
i
seek
in
a
brown
ale
o
very
good
brown
ale
with
a
lot
of
flavor
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
you
want
hazelnut
this
is
your
beer
great
tasting
that
finishes
clear
but
the
aroma
is
with
you
throughout
d
my
first
rogue
beer
and
this
thing
did
not
disappoint
it
was
just
an
assault
of
unrelenting
malty
goodness
ill
admit
brown
ales
are
far
from
my
preferred
style
but
this
exceeded
all
expectations
and
then
some
a
truly
great
beer
from
rogue
and
one
ill
be
having
many
more
times
this
is
really
really
good
i
scoffed
at
the
high
price
of
the
sixpack
at
first
but
it
may
be
worth
it
o
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
rogue
though
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
this
is
my
favorite
brown
ales
for
easy
to
drink
with
big
hazelnut
nice
job
overall
i
would
gladly
have
it
again
reminds
me
of
the
bohemia
chocolate
stout
but
only
because
i
had
this
one
first
but
better
in
every
way
leaves
you
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
wanting
another
one
which
is
possible
thanks
to
its
abv
and
flavor
o
tasty
take
on
a
brown
combined
a
nutty
caramel
sweetness
with
refreshing
complimentary
bitter
a
nice
dessert
pick
would
buy
again
at
the
right
price
overall
its
a
really
nice
beer
to
drink
its
a
bit
expensive
at
8
bucks
but
its
worth
it
give
it
a
try
overall
this
was
tasty
but
not
what
id
call
worldclass
much
like
most
rogue
beers
its
just
a
little
to
light
and
mild
for
its
only
good
the
hazelnut
addition
adds
a
excellent
flavor
and
is
enough
to
set
it
apart
from
the
rest
maybe
a
little
more
malt
and
hop
woudl
be
nice
cause
this
beer
still
is
6
2
so
its
not
like
its
a
light
45
so
a
little
more
kick
would
work
well
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
cream
head
that
stands
2
fingers
tall
in
my
duvel
tulip
head
recedes
to
a
film
with
a
ring
around
the
edge
of
my
glass
as
i
drink
it
leaves
some
rings
of
lacing
in
my
glass
smell
is
of
bread
toffee
hazlenut
not
particularly
roasty
smelling
but
smooth
and
malty
without
being
too
sweet
in
the
taste
i
get
the
hazlenut
flavors
and
then
a
clean
pop
of
caramel
the
end
of
the
taste
has
a
slightly
deeper
darker
malt
profile
maybe
a
tough
of
chocolate
in
there
only
a
touch
of
roasted
flavor
comes
out
body
is
on
the
thicker
side
just
right
for
a
brown
ale
and
the
carbonation
is
not
too
agressive
making
this
a
very
smooth
beer
i
really
loved
this
i
think
it
has
become
my
favorite
brown
ale
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
dark
mahogany
colored
body
with
a
very
little
tan
head
that
quickly
dissapears
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
nutty
and
malty
the
is
of
hazelunt
up
front
with
some
roasted
malt
a
little
bit
of
hop
come
through
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
has
a
great
mouth
feel
well
balanced
overall
this
is
a
really
good
brown
ale
the
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
not
bad
i
was
excited
to
see
this
in
six
packs
but
lets
be
honest
here
im
still
going
to
pass
o
i
love
the
nose
of
this
beer
the
taste
runs
a
course
from
sweet
to
malty
i
like
how
this
is
not
overpowered
by
the
hazelnut
there
is
plenty
of
it
there
but
other
flavors
balance
it
out
o
a
decent
beer
that
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
i
need
to
revisit
overall
a
great
twist
on
the
american
brown
ale
with
a
flavor
punch
without
being
too
sweet
a
dark
brown
apperance
with
a
thick
creamy
head
a
slight
hazelnut
and
hop
smell
taste
was
mild
and
balance
with
slight
nutty
flavor
the
texture
in
the
mouth
was
smooth
and
creamy
overall
this
was
a
easy
drinking
beer
and
could
be
consumed
in
large
volume
o
good
brown
ale
nuttiest
one
ive
had
definitely
try
it
if
youre
a
fan
of
nuts
especially
hazelnut
4
2
3
4
4
must
try
if
you
like
hazelnut
very
solid
brown
ale
o
this
is
excellent
i
like
rogue
a
lot
i
wouldnt
say
this
beats
their
chocolate
stout
in
my
opinion
but
this
is
a
very
solid
and
tasty
beer
amazing
quality
and
its
been
a
wonderful
experience
to
try
this
for
the
first
time
i
will
buy
this
again
and
i
will
be
recommending
this
beer
with
pleasure
o
a
solid
brown
ale
deff
will
be
buying
this
again
worth
a
try
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
prefer
my
brown
ales
to
taste
more
like
a
chocolate
milkshake
as
opposed
to
nutty
that
being
said
this
is
really
quite
pleasant
im
not
certain
i
can
say
ive
had
anything
quite
like
it
overall
an
awesome
beer
but
with
a
better
texture
could
be
an
amazing
beer
o
not
a
big
hazelnut
fan
so
i
wont
do
this
again
but
it
is
worth
seeking
out
especially
if
you
have
a
live
for
hazelnut
coffee
o
a
very
nice
brown
ale
with
tons
of
hazelnut
flavor
a
very
well
done
brown
ale
the
hazelnut
definitely
came
through
as
advertised
which
i
appreciated
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
now
that
its
offered
in
6
packs
make
me
a
very
happy
person
it
is
a
bit
of
a
one
dimensional
beer
its
definitely
hazelnutcentric
but
that
one
focus
is
done
well
and
is
of
a
flavor
that
i
love
overall
a
nice
flavoured
brown
ale
from
rogue
the
flavours
balance
quite
nicely
and
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
brown
ale
o
a
fantastic
ale
would
highly
recommend
very
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
this
on
tap
will
seek
it
out
in
bottles
as
well
from
now
on
this
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
color
with
a
creamy
brownish
head
nicely
carbonated
a
good
looking
beer
this
has
a
sweet
caramel
smell
nothing
that
knocks
me
out
but
nothing
off
putting
either
the
smell
actually
gets
better
as
the
head
settles
in
a
word
this
tastes
nutty
its
just
a
hair
on
the
bitter
side
im
not
a
huge
fan
but
ive
had
worse
this
is
obviously
a
personal
preference
so
im
not
going
to
dock
it
too
much
it
has
a
nice
feel
to
it
almost
a
little
creamy
the
texture
and
the
abv
lead
to
a
highly
drinkable
beer
i
couldnt
again
the
style
isnt
just
for
me
but
i
think
everyone
should
at
least
give
this
a
shot
s
22
oz
bottle
drink
not
my
favorite
offering
from
rogue
but
they
do
advertise
the
hazelnut
and
i
appreciate
that
they
actually
delivered
on
that
promise
probably
wont
come
back
to
this
one
but
oh
well
the
beer
is
brown
with
an
inch
or
so
of
head
smells
of
hazelnut
nuts
malt
vanilla
sugar
pretty
sweet
so
one
pint
is
plenty
nice
flavor
im
a
huge
fan
of
hazelnuts
hazelnut
flavor
and
this
beer
delivers
well
balanced
and
tasty
although
a
bit
sweet
still
a
solid
effort
and
im
a
sucker
for
hazelnuts
i
enjoy
having
this
every
now
and
again
o
wellbalance
not
overly
sweet
and
quite
pleasant
o
overall
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
i
liked
the
taste
a
little
more
than
the
nose
due
to
more
vanillacream
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
whole
bomber
would
have
it
again
o
i
love
brown
ales
and
was
eager
to
try
this
but
overall
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
a
misfire
from
rogue
lack
of
carbonation
off
flavor
combinations
and
too
much
hazelnut
and
not
much
else
left
me
scratching
my
head
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
give
me
a
breckenridge
mighty
brown
or
a
dfh
indian
brown
ale
anyday
overall
a
knockout
o
a
pretty
decent
brew
not
really
what
id
go
for
normally
but
as
of
yet
i
havent
drank
a
rogue
beer
that
i
havent
liked
its
worth
a
juniorcollege
try
o
really
nice
the
hazelnut
flavor
really
does
a
good
job
in
the
brown
ale
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
if
it
was
in
12oz
bottles
would
pick
it
up
more
regularly
m
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
but
im
a
big
stout
man
velvety
texture
is
quite
nice
though
i
had
high
expectations
so
this
was
definitely
a
disappointment
not
too
heavy
drinkable
medium
body
and
not
overwhelming
on
the
hazelnut
overall
an
excellent
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
very
complete
and
steady
from
first
taste
to
last
overall
this
is
a
great
brown
and
very
much
on
its
own
as
far
as
the
style
i
cant
think
of
any
other
beer
to
compare
it
too
food
pairing
cheeseburger
or
bbq
pulled
pork
sandwich
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
vigorous
pour
gives
a
nice
thick
off
white
to
tan
colored
head
the
color
is
brown
but
on
the
lighter
side
of
brown
the
smell
is
sweet
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
toffee
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
basic
brown
ale
character
low
to
no
hops
semi
sweet
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
sam
smith
and
dfh
the
beer
sits
light
on
your
tongue
not
heavy
or
overbearing
by
any
stretch
overall
quite
a
pleasant
experience
one
of
the
better
examples
of
a
flavored
beer
for
sure
if
youre
a
brown
ale
type
and
have
a
thing
for
hazelut
in
other
beverage
arenas
you
cant
pass
this
one
up
o
very
nice
beer
certainly
i
will
have
it
again
this
one
is
pretty
strange
at
first
pour
it
looks
amazing
deep
reddish
amber
small
head
tight
bubbles
great
carbonation
nose
gets
a
little
weird
biscuity
malty
and
hazelnut
which
doesnt
seem
to
quite
fit
taste
is
very
malty
syrupy
sweet
with
hazelnut
overtones
sweetness
lingers
overall
a
nice
effort
pretty
much
as
expected
overall
really
a
solid
brew
from
rogue
i
can
see
why
this
one
is
so
highly
rated
very
interesting
aroma
and
flavors
going
on
with
high
drinkability
add
up
to
a
great
option
in
the
brown
ale
arena
o
quite
impressive
brown
ales
arent
generally
my
goto
beer
but
ill
most
definitely
be
tracking
this
one
down
in
the
near
future
outstanding
overall
smooth
robust
a
sitting
by
the
fire
sipper
ive
never
had
a
taste
like
this
before
the
hazelnut
really
makes
it
pop
i
see
why
its
so
recommended
would
love
to
try
on
tap
very
focused
flavors
here
delicate
yet
refined
good
texture
and
very
enjoyable
on
any
occasion
this
is
a
very
exceptional
brown
ale
very
well
done
it
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
light
welcoming
aroma
i
didnt
get
anything
resembling
a
hazelnut
on
the
nose
although
im
not
sure
id
get
much
of
a
hazelnut
aroma
from
an
actual
hazelnut
either
this
beer
taste
great
it
has
a
sweetness
to
it
without
being
overly
malty
or
syrupy
and
a
finish
that
i
would
describe
as
hazelnuts
on
parade
not
your
typical
brown
ale
but
oh
so
good
o
this
is
a
good
beer
great
flavors
and
balance
o
a
very
good
brown
ale
it
has
the
characteristics
needed
of
a
brown
ale
to
make
a
person
know
what
style
it
is
while
also
going
a
different
direction
with
the
unique
hazelnut
nectar
giving
it
the
tools
to
be
seperate
from
others
its
just
a
good
home
brew
style
recipe
that
gets
the
credit
it
deserves
like
a
mad
scientist
taking
a
classic
style
and
turning
it
into
his
own
world
class
piece
of
art
overall
i
am
in
awe
how
delicious
this
brew
taste
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
raisinets
everyone
at
the
table
4
loved
itits
creamy
seet
hazelnut
and
a
great
malt
it
is
not
too
heavy
or
too
light
love
it
love
rogue
cheers
oreally
nice
beer
for
dessert
notes
ontap
at
sanctuary
quite
sweet
and
lots
of
hazelnut
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
and
it
makes
for
a
nice
dessert
or
just
kind
of
a
sweet
nightcap
o
love
it
i
think
its
seriously
a
great
beer
o
im
surprised
i
liked
this
one
so
much
but
then
again
the
rogue
brewery
do
conjure
up
such
magnificent
brews
love
it
overall
a
great
brown
that
i
wish
i
had
tried
sooner
even
though
i
can
get
a
local
six
pack
for
almost
the
same
price
as
a
22
oz
bottle
of
this
ill
surely
pick
it
up
again
overall
not
a
bad
brown
but
much
more
potential
i
feel
like
hazelnut
is
the
perfect
nut
for
this
style
and
it
wasnt
showcased
enough
still
i
wont
turn
this
down
if
offered
and
i
might
buy
it
again
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
great
rendition
of
a
brown
ale
not
my
favorite
but
tasty
and
not
too
filling
rogue
has
done
it
again
what
a
unique
fantastic
brew
and
extra
points
for
adding
an
ingredients
list
why
dont
all
beers
do
this
the
look
is
pretty
basic
brown
and
decent
head
where
this
beer
shines
is
in
the
excellent
malt
base
and
perfect
pairing
of
hazelnut
nothing
extremely
complex
and
brilliant
because
it
lets
the
balanced
hazelnut
taste
be
the
star
beer
candy
overall
its
easy
to
agree
with
all
of
the
awards
and
accolades
this
beer
has
earned
its
an
extremely
wellcrafted
beer
that
hits
the
promised
mark
hazelnut
nectar
and
avoids
all
pitfalls
such
as
being
overly
sweet
overpoweringly
nutty
and
so
on
its
a
pleasantly
complex
beer
with
all
the
comforting
qualities
of
a
brown
as
well
as
being
unique
without
being
strange
and
refreshing
in
its
way
not
blown
away
by
this
one
but
still
very
easy
too
drink
if
you
like
hazelnut
this
ones
for
you
this
beer
is
really
good
and
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
great
malt
base
sweet
and
with
nice
dark
fruit
presence
the
hazelnut
works
really
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
delicious
o
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
and
is
definitely
my
go
to
when
im
in
the
mood
for
this
style
only
ranked
9
wtf
this
is
one
solid
beer
even
without
the
hazelnut
the
mouthfeel
density
taste
and
smell
are
all
spot
on
with
what
you
expect
from
an
american
brown
ale
then
the
twinge
of
hazelnut
mixes
with
the
toasted
malts
giving
a
medley
of
balance
and
flavor
upon
hearing
the
term
nectar
one
would
think
this
would
be
a
sweet
or
heavy
beer
its
not
o
what
better
to
accompany
a
sunday
brunch
than
some
hazelnut
brown
nectar
pancakes
breakfast
scrambler
hazelnut
brown
nectar
win
so
with
everything
ive
babbled
on
about
go
out
and
try
it
for
yourself
and
write
your
own
review
i
drank
the
whole
bomber
watching
football
great
sipping
beer
with
junk
food
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
brown
ale
with
a
lot
of
flavor
rogue
surely
nailed
the
style
with
this
beer
if
im
going
to
drink
a
rogue
beer
over
6
abv
my
preference
would
still
be
dead
guy
ale
o
very
unique
within
the
style
sweeter
and
more
distinguished
than
any
other
nut
brown
ale
ive
had
which
admittedly
isnt
all
that
many
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
and
id
recommend
you
give
it
a
try
overall
this
is
a
something
id
want
as
a
session
beer
and
openly
proclaimed
such
but
it
needs
to
be
about
2
lower
in
abv
for
that
to
happen
i
wonder
how
much
was
missed
out
on
from
the
draft
pour
it
was
excellent
in
flavor
and
feel
definitely
a
beer
id
go
back
for
probably
the
best
american
brown
ale
ive
had
overall
excellent
beer
overall
the
hazelnut
really
adds
a
nice
character
to
the
brown
ale
style
id
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
overall
great
beer
to
start
my
night
wellpleased
with
an
outstanding
beer
from
rogue
cant
speak
for
the
bottle
but
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
on
tap
its
a
mustdo
d
different
for
a
brown
considering
the
lack
of
roasted
malt
but
still
very
delicious
brew
its
light
drinking
body
makes
it
very
quaffable
unique
and
enjoyable
overall
o
good
brown
ale
but
i
was
expecting
more
thanks
the
advertising
behind
the
beer
i
would
try
it
again
but
its
not
my
favorite
perfectly
medium
body
and
flavor
a
substantial
presence
but
still
very
drinkable
just
a
bit
too
fizzy
to
be
great
i
could
drink
this
all
november
o
this
is
a
brilliant
example
of
an
american
brown
ale
sweettasting
lots
of
personality
wellbalanced
everything
you
want
initially
i
will
admit
that
i
was
hesitant
to
try
a
brew
with
hazelnut
flavorsi
kept
imagining
the
overlysyruped
coffees
at
the
local
java
jointbut
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
be
dead
wrong
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
wonderfully
complex
brew
with
many
layers
and
nuances
to
explore
overall
an
amazing
twist
on
a
brown
ale
you
could
down
more
than
a
few
of
these
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
o
i
really
like
this
brown
ale
the
hazelnut
is
nice
and
subtle
not
offputting
at
all
it
sets
this
one
apart
from
other
brown
ales
one
of
my
new
favorites
o
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
i
have
not
tried
to
many
rogues
beers
but
saw
this
in
a
local
six
pack
shop
and
decided
to
take
it
for
a
whirl
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
i
think
it
adds
lots
of
character
to
the
beer
it
is
not
too
sweet
like
other
beers
i
have
encountered
it
is
also
not
too
bitter
i
would
reccommend
this
beer
to
anyone
if
they
do
not
know
much
about
beers
or
are
looking
for
something
new
to
try
i
had
mine
after
dinner
and
it
felt
like
a
very
pleasant
dessert
o
what
rogue
advertises
they
do
ill
give
them
that
they
dont
sell
this
as
a
porter
a
stout
or
even
an
imperial
ale
its
a
brown
ale
or
a
nectar
as
the
bottle
puts
it
while
this
may
not
be
the
thickest
most
jawdropping
beer
youd
ever
have
they
do
work
the
flavors
out
really
well
its
a
very
pleasant
drinking
experience
especially
as
a
accompaniment
to
food
if
you
need
something
sugary
enough
to
satisfy
your
sweet
tooth
during
a
meal
but
light
enough
to
be
refreshing
this
beers
for
you
it
was
not
particularly
complex
but
good
and
balanced
it
wasnt
as
full
bodied
as
the
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
and
id
say
probably
one
notch
below
the
samuel
smith
overall
o
well
done
beer
not
much
of
a
rogue
fan
but
this
is
good
stuff
i
recall
having
this
several
years
ago
and
really
digging
it
but
didnt
think
that
memory
would
serve
consistent
right
on
o
theres
a
reason
this
is
top
rated
if
you
have
access
to
it
youd
be
doing
yourself
a
disservice
by
not
grabbing
several
bottles
very
nice
tasting
beer
highly
drinkable
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
the
hazelnut
was
definitely
the
main
focus
in
nose
and
taste
but
did
not
overwhelm
the
senses
what
a
great
change
of
pace
from
the
typical
brown
ale
i
would
be
willing
to
trade
my
next
cup
of
specialty
coffee
for
this
any
time
o
thoroughly
enjoyable
albeit
not
fantastic
glad
i
tried
it
once
and
i
would
go
back
to
again
if
i
needed
something
nutty
this
one
was
a
treat
poured
darkish
brown
with
a
fair
bit
of
tan
head
smelled
nutty
with
malts
and
caramel
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
the
caramel
hazelnuts
and
malts
definitely
shine
but
there
is
some
hop
character
present
although
very
subtle
the
flavor
is
very
complex
but
not
overtly
so
a
delight
to
enjoy
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
and
it
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
delicious
and
flavorful
brown
ale
the
hazelnut
really
adds
a
lot
i
had
never
thought
about
that
as
a
potential
flavor
in
beer
before
but
it
works
great
otherwise
its
just
a
generally
above
average
brown
ale
decent
strength
makes
it
not
quite
sessionable
but
not
overpowering
either
the
hazelnut
takes
this
from
just
good
to
unique
though
and
thats
the
reason
to
try
it
and
the
reason
i
would
come
back
again
wish
it
didnt
feel
so
thin
though
overall
a
good
beer
would
be
greatly
improved
with
a
bigger
body
still
definitely
a
nice
one
o
if
this
beer
was
thicker
it
may
have
added
to
the
flavor
profile
but
i
believe
the
consistency
peels
the
flavors
apart
cheers
overall
a
good
beer
much
better
than
any
brown
ale
ive
had
before
i
a
tremendously
delicious
brown
aleperhaps
my
favorite
within
the
style
a
lot
of
varying
relatively
complex
flavors
come
together
for
an
extraordinarily
drinkable
and
highly
delicious
beer
i
cant
help
but
gulp
this
overall
very
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
delicious
mo
pretty
drinkable
well
balanced
lightly
carbonated
flavorful
really
this
is
a
great
craft
product
this
beer
was
my
first
favorite
and
is
still
a
goto
for
me
perfect
when
you
want
a
robust
rich
brown
ale
thats
not
too
complex
m
thintomedium
body
with
good
carbonation
slightly
watery
but
with
a
sweet
syrupy
finish
nice
carbonation
sting
gives
way
to
hazelnut
followed
by
a
faint
honey
flavor
finishes
dry
woody
and
nutty
plumb
is
detected
as
it
warms
a
very
solid
tasty
brown
ale
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
rich
brown
color
the
head
was
a
light
tan
color
with
some
light
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
big
with
hazelnut
kind
of
impressed
actually
i
didnt
expect
its
aroma
to
be
so
prominent
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
sweet
at
first
and
then
finished
with
a
nice
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
bad
really
it
was
decent
for
the
style
overall
its
an
interesting
brew
and
worth
trying
for
sure
o
i
really
do
like
this
beer
its
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
there
are
no
dominant
tastes
everything
is
well
balanced
i
would
drink
again
a
nice
flavorful
light
feeling
beer
this
was
a
good
brown
ale
and
very
true
to
its
style
but
i
was
honestly
hoping
for
more
of
a
novelty
beer
a
candybar
in
a
bottle
the
brewer
went
for
balance
here
but
i
think
it
would
have
been
interesting
to
go
for
richness
instead
i
dont
think
the
hazelnut
flavors
complement
the
hops
very
well
but
they
do
complement
the
malt
combining
hazelnut
with
a
sweeter
richer
beer
that
has
more
residual
malt
would
be
interesting
still
this
was
a
very
nice
brown
ale
and
should
be
enjoyed
by
anyone
who
likes
this
style
let
me
start
off
saying
that
is
by
far
the
best
brown
i
have
had
hands
down
poured
out
very
brown
almost
like
a
wood
stain
of
some
kind
little
head
that
tried
to
hold
on
till
the
end
but
left
some
lacing
right
off
the
smell
sucked
me
in
it
was
very
sweet
nutty
chocolate
coffee
and
some
malt
you
can
definitively
tell
there
is
hazelnut
in
there
the
first
sip
was
astonishing
sweet
but
not
too
much
lots
of
hazelnut
with
some
chocolate
and
coffee
the
thing
that
made
this
beer
stand
out
is
that
it
was
paired
with
a
final
bitterness
that
didnt
cover
up
the
sweetness
but
rather
complimented
it
just
enough
so
you
knew
you
werent
drinking
an
iced
mocha
morning
shit
but
a
beer
i
wouldnt
go
as
far
to
say
it
was
a
dessert
beer
but
it
definitively
is
a
treat
would
i
buy
this
again
not
sure
i
would
try
it
in
the
bottle
even
though
i
have
much
love
for
taps
would
i
recommend
it
yes
due
to
its
oddness
and
creativity
overy
happy
with
this
beer
different
from
any
other
porter
i
have
had
not
to
sweet
not
to
bitter
just
right
o
overall
its
a
good
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
it
drinks
a
lot
like
a
mellow
much
weaker
coffee
stout
so
if
you
want
something
not
as
powerful
this
is
your
drink
it
was
a
great
decision
for
rogue
to
distribute
this
beer
nationwide
it
is
the
best
brown
that
i
have
had
and
i
continue
to
enjoy
this
flavor
o
this
is
one
fine
brown
ale
and
definitely
worth
checking
out
its
everything
it
says
it
will
be
overall
quite
good
better
than
i
would
have
expected
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
way
to
cap
off
the
night
hazel
nut
wow
it
def
has
that
aroma
and
taste
in
this
beer
and
thats
about
all
you
really
taste
i
wish
the
hazelnut
wasnt
so
watered
down
dont
get
me
wrong
the
hazelnut
is
def
prominent
in
this
beer
the
taste
is
pretty
nutty
its
not
bad
actually
the
nut
is
starting
to
come
more
out
since
the
beer
is
warming
up
im
really
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
o
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
because
the
hazelnut
taste
gets
old
not
executed
as
well
as
i
feel
it
could
have
been
becvause
i
think
the
idea
is
great
but
too
sweet
and
extracty
for
me
i
love
nut
brown
ales
and
hazelnut
seems
like
a
perferct
addition
or
showcase
but
please
tone
down
the
extract
to
let
the
other
flavors
shine
more
i
think
it
would
really
help
the
beer
out
poured
a
dark
tea
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
settled
to
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
toasty
malts
in
the
aroma
and
not
much
else
slightly
nutty
taste
its
a
brown
ale
malts
and
malts
some
caramel
a
bit
of
nuttiness
brown
sugar
and
some
coffee
bitterness
not
really
hazelnut
though
medium
body
somewhat
drinkable
but
pretty
bland
i
thought
after
this
beer
warmed
more
it
got
smoother
to
drink
and
the
carbonation
was
much
less
offensive
the
flavors
also
came
out
more
but
only
by
a
little
bit
the
taste
got
better
but
now
its
just
closer
to
a
4
than
to
a
3
but
still
a
solid
3
5
atmosphere
is
great
rich
brown
body
a
really
thick
frothy
head
and
very
persistent
lacing
nose
is
a
great
combination
of
very
softly
done
nut
and
fruit
it
kinda
makes
me
think
of
freshly
baked
banana
bread
flavor
is
bittersweet
malt
and
subtle
sweet
notes
with
a
thick
robust
body
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
wow
i
was
not
expecting
this
beer
to
be
this
good
this
is
fantastic
this
is
almost
like
drinking
dairy
creamer
its
so
good
overall
a
finely
crafted
beer
good
drinkability
on
top
of
great
flavor
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
rich
sweet
chocolately
beers
my
wife
swears
by
this
beer
and
while
i
wouldnt
kill
for
it
the
way
she
would
i
would
definitely
injure
for
it
huge
hazelnut
flavor
announces
itself
through
the
nose
the
strong
flavor
sticks
with
you
via
aftertaste
but
in
this
case
thats
a
good
thing
more
of
a
desert
beer
than
an
everyday
drink
but
its
a
damn
good
one
o
every
time
this
beer
blows
me
away
its
so
drinkable
and
every
drink
is
enjoyable
nice
light
sweetness
mixed
with
earthy
nuttiness
highly
recommended
o
this
was
a
nice
surprise
ill
definitely
pick
this
up
again
perhaps
to
pair
with
a
dessert
poured
a
nice
rich
clear
medium
to
dark
brown
with
an
average
sized
light
brown
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
leaving
just
a
little
residue
hanging
around
allowing
for
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
a
nutty
caramel
malt
and
a
doughy
yeast
with
a
nice
note
of
hazelnut
brown
sugar
and
a
ever
so
light
touch
of
coffee
it
tasted
lightly
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
and
coffee
in
the
beginning
then
it
matured
into
a
very
maltynutty
flavor
with
the
hazelnut
being
the
most
pronounced
at
the
finish
although
the
flavor
could
of
lasted
a
little
longer
on
the
taste
buds
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
creamy
yet
slightly
watery
in
texture
as
alot
of
brown
ales
can
be
with
the
carbonation
being
ever
so
perfectly
soft
overall
a
very
nice
malty
nut
brown
ale
this
happens
to
be
my
favorite
style
and
this
brew
fits
it
very
well
indeed
i
hate
to
say
this
again
but
rogue
stop
charging
these
prices
for
your
beer
or
at
least
stop
bottling
everything
in
bombers
at
7
bucks
a
bottle
i
cant
see
any
reason
to
ever
come
back
to
this
beer
unless
on
tap
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
and
certainly
worth
trying
but
the
price
truly
hurts
it
good
but
not
great
and
not
worth
the
money
o
this
beer
becomes
light
as
air
to
drink
and
is
excellent
in
the
winter
and
probably
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
as
well
an
interesting
beer
and
a
good
use
of
hazelnut
flavour
the
nut
character
is
a
bit
much
for
some
but
i
think
it
works
taste
is
very
sweet
right
away
interesting
i
get
the
nectar
label
its
very
sweet
not
in
a
cloying
barley
way
but
almost
in
a
juice
or
dessert
way
the
hazelnut
is
obvious
but
subtle
and
adds
a
nice
accent
to
a
solid
brown
ale
overall
pretty
good
a
tasty
treat
highly
recommended
overall
i
just
keep
liking
this
more
and
more
with
every
sip
sooo
good
a
memorable
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
o
well
put
together
and
the
hazelnut
isnt
as
prevalent
as
i
had
feared
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
with
the
right
abv
and
ibu
i
wish
it
came
in
smaller
bottles
as
its
biggest
down
side
is
the
6
99
for
a
bomber
that
said
go
grab
one
and
see
for
yourself
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
small
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
to
dry
nuttiness
and
a
sweet
malt
in
the
taste
stickysweet
nuttiness
and
a
sweet
malt
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
sweet
nuttiness
in
the
aftertaste
sticky
sweet
that
can
be
a
bit
much
when
it
gets
warmer
but
mostly
enjoyable
o
the
hazelnut
flavor
is
great
definitely
gonna
pick
this
one
up
again
overall
for
the
price
not
the
best
value
6
for
22oz
but
a
good
beverage
worth
trying
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
its
not
too
thick
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
topnotch
as
well
this
is
actually
a
beer
that
im
glad
is
in
largeformat
bottles
because
drinking
all
of
it
isnt
an
issue
at
all
a
seriously
great
brown
ale
that
i
highly
recommend
o
a
good
brown
with
the
hazelnut
well
added
good
to
see
a
flavor
addition
contribute
positively
to
the
beer
a
lot
of
people
criticize
pacman
yeast
on
these
forums
but
i
think
it
worked
well
here
tasty
throughout
a
nice
medium
brown
color
with
ample
tan
head
chocolate
and
hazelnut
aroma
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
perhaps
some
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
all
hazelnut
with
some
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
caramel
i
didnt
really
get
much
hops
in
there
other
than
a
pleasant
bitterness
that
helped
to
balance
the
intense
hazelnut
medium
body
but
a
bit
thin
mouthfeel
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
like
hazelnut
but
i
thought
this
had
just
a
bit
too
much
rogue
hazelnut
brown
nectar
is
a
clear
redbrown
ale
with
a
yellowish
white
head
that
vanishes
quickly
it
has
a
nutty
aroma
thats
a
touch
sweet
its
light
and
lively
on
the
tongue
it
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
chalky
and
numb
it
has
lots
of
hazelnut
flavor
not
sweet
nor
dry
there
is
just
enough
bitterness
to
make
it
drinkable
theres
a
huge
hazelnut
aftertaste
it
really
delivers
the
hazelnut
but
its
quite
a
stretch
to
call
it
a
nectar
this
is
ok
but
mildly
disappointing
by
rogue
standards
o
a
great
brown
truly
hard
to
match
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
draft
overall
definitely
a
solid
brew
in
terms
of
a
hazelnut
brown
nectar

5444this
was
a
pretty
decent
brown
ale
easy
to
go
down
tasty
and
a
good
one
to
start
the
night
with
not
sure
about
food
pairings
but
this
was
a
good
first
pint
recommended
to
all
coffee
lovers
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
d
awesome
a
little
sweet
for
my
palate
but
definately
drinkable
tasty
well
balanced
and
nothing
too
bold
very
deep
brown
in
color
with
dark
red
hues
phenomenal
rocky
brown
head
excellent
retention
sticks
around
for
a
long
time
good
amount
of
lacing
as
well
not
too
much
but
a
noticeable
amount
very
aromatic
nose
extremely
nutty
and
toasty
sweet
caramel
and
natural
grains
notes
make
an
appearance
brown
sugar
also
comes
to
mind
taste
is
caramel
coffee
like
with
some
nutty
undertones
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
middle
but
sweetens
up
a
bit
with
and
almond
like
alcohol
taste
in
the
finish
very
good
mouth
feel
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
velvet
finish
hell
this
is
one
awesome
brown
ale
drinkability
is
10
out
of
10
very
aromatic
and
tasty
this
beer
opens
up
with
a
maltyness
which
turns
into
a
sweet
then
nutty
flavor
its
more
of
a
sweet
caramelish
flavor
than
nutty
it
has
a
certain
crispness
to
it
from
the
dry
finish
its
an
interesting
flavor
not
as
nutty
as
i
was
expecting
but
still
very
good
the
carbonation
is
pretty
sharp
but
this
beer
is
still
very
drinkable
and
easy
to
put
down
sweet
beers
are
right
up
my
alley
so
i
was
looking
forward
to
indulging
in
this
beer
unfortunately
it
was
quite
a
disappointment
in
almost
every
single
way
the
taste
is
far
too
mild
to
be
truly
enjoyable
and
its
just
way
too
thin
makes
for
easy
enough
drinking
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
this
brew
any
time
soon
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
14
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
nutty
and
mimics
the
actual
taste
of
the
beer
tastes
of
light
coffee
up
front
but
sweet
caramel
and
almond
on
the
back
end
it
is
tough
to
stop
at
just
one
of
these
and
got
my
normally
non
adventurous
travelmates
addicted
as
well
sampled
at
the
portland
airport
mouthfeel
lacks
in
depth
as
its
noticeably
light
as
well
thin
feel
with
a
small
carbonated
presence
though
its
very
easily
drinkable
overall
just
wished
it
was
a
bit
more
substantially
bigger
in
flavor
this
is
a
damn
fine
brew
a
fantastic
brown
ale
this
is
some
serious
sessionable
stuff
here
my
wife
stole
half
my
brew
brew
is
great
in
every
aspect
another
top
shelf
brew
from
rogue
drink
ability
i
could
drink
this
all
night
not
filling
delicious
tasting
no
booze
taste
at
all
i
wish
i
bought
another
one
so
i
could
drink
some
more
now
in
conclusion
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
definitely
see
myself
trying
this
again
on
a
day
where
i
crave
sweets
i
would
not
recommend
this
for
anyone
who
enjoys
fuller
bodied
beers
or
hoppy
beers
for
that
matter
d
overall
it
was
decent
but
not
for
5
5022oz
bottle
if
im
paying
that
much
for
a
beer
i
expect
it
to
be
something
that
i
can
sip
slowly
and
enjoy
i
was
unimpressed
o
the
hazelnut
in
this
beer
is
incredible
the
toasted
character
is
warm
and
soothing
with
soft
edges
that
are
noticeably
absent
of
burnt
notes
d
just
too
sweet
for
me
i
dont
think
ill
have
this
one
again
drinkability
3
out
of
5
with
some
smoked
barbeque
or
some
german
chocolate
cake
this
would
be
awesome
in
the
absence
of
complimentary
cuisine
however
its
a
bit
too
strong
to
drink
more
than
one
22oz
bottle
even
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
it
it
was
a
good
experience
and
not
a
bad
drink
by
any
means
but
barring
a
drastic
influx
of
pork
and
cake
into
my
diet
i
wont
be
picking
up
another
it
would
be
great
to
split
with
a
friend
or
two
after
dinner
d
amazing
brown
ale
this
is
my
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
and
i
could
definitely
have
more
than
a
few
of
these
delightful
brews
d
great
drinkability
id
definitely
have
a
bomber
along
with
desert
any
day
d
a
really
good
brew
i
expected
the
sweetness
however
i
wasnt
ready
for
the
bitter
finish
great
balance
and
a
good
brew
this
would
probably
be
a
musttry
if
youre
crazy
for
brown
ales
otherwise
youre
not
missing
much
if
you
pass
this
beer
pours
an
aber
color
with
an
off
white
head
like
a
light
tan
color
the
aroma
of
this
beer
smells
of
rich
in
malt
there
is
also
a
hint
of
nutty
aroma
the
taste
is
strong
with
nutty
sweetness
to
it
classic
brown
ale
taste
to
it
there
is
a
hazlenut
sweetness
to
it
although
you
can
tell
its
extract
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
is
a
drinkable
beer
picked
this
up
very
exciting
to
try
another
rogue
beer
it
pours
a
very
nice
dark
reddish
color
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
that
was
very
creamy
about
2
fingers
the
nose
is
very
very
nutty
with
some
malt
the
only
thing
i
get
in
the
taste
is
a
bunch
of
nuttieness
maybe
a
slight
bit
of
malt
the
nuts
overpowers
the
taste
way
too
much
it
is
also
way
too
sweet
it
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
but
not
a
great
bit
of
drinability
just
because
its
way
too
sweet
im
a
big
fan
of
rogue
but
this
is
the
only
beer
by
them
ive
had
that
i
would
not
recommend
drinking
way
too
sweet
not
very
complex
i
was
disappointed
to
be
honest
as
a
side
note
i
tried
mixing
this
with
the
chocolate
stout
on
the
advice
of
a
local
rogue
rep
and
it
was
awesome
has
a
amberbrown
appearance
with
a
decent
tan
head
you
can
definitely
smell
the
hazelnut
and
it
carries
through
into
the
taste
smooth
and
malty
with
little
bitterness
it
was
easy
going
down
and
not
overly
carbonated
altough
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
and
would
order
again
not
sure
i
would
have
again
on
its
own
but
perhaps
paired
with
the
appropriate
cheese
or
something
it
would
be
worth
revisiting
drinks
like
one
of
the
better
browns
out
there
its
smooth
balanced
and
dammit
i
loves
me
some
hazelnuts
d
very
unique
flavor
i
think
rogue
probably
accomplished
what
they
wanted
to
do
with
this
beer
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
too
sweet
and
while
the
flavor
was
good
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
multiples
or
going
back
for
this
one
again
very
complex
for
a
brown
ale
yet
very
drinkable
truly
one
of
my
favorite
notes
i
love
a
good
brown
ale
and
this
one
just
shot
toward
the
top
of
my
list
the
malt
and
hazelnut
appears
and
finish
together
it
is
smooth
throughout
very
well
put
together
the
crystal
malts
and
the
hazelnut
are
lite
but
are
wonderful
this
is
perhaps
the
best
example
of
how
use
of
ingredients
outside
the
4
can
make
a
wonderful
beer
d
a
little
more
sweet
and
a
little
less
sour
woulda
done
it
for
me
lacked
the
malty
richness
i
expected
it
looked
brown
tasted
like
nectar
would
to
bees
consider
we
are
human
very
smooth
i
could
drink
this
for
a
substitute
of
juice
for
breakfast
any
day
the
only
complaint
is
the
bottle
should
be
bigger
or
come
in
six
pack
of
cans
cause
i
could
shotgun
about
6
of
these
bastards
d
very
smooth
and
drinkable
brown
ale
i
love
hazelnuts
so
this
beer
really
hit
the
spot
for
me
pouring
dark
brown
with
a
thin
brown
head
that
recedes
to
a
ring
rather
quick
this
is
decent
the
nose
is
just
a
little
disappointing
caramel
and
some
brown
sugar
are
noticeable
but
what
jumps
right
out
are
soggy
corn
flakes
unsweetened
initially
the
hazelnut
is
really
strong
but
it
gently
fades
bringing
a
some
of
balance
the
palate
opens
lightly
sweet
with
caramel
brown
sugar
and
quite
a
bit
of
hazelnut
flavor
again
i
get
a
strange
soggy
cereal
flavor
rather
offputting
mildly
sweet
on
the
finish
this
is
mediumlight
in
body
and
has
moderate
carbonation
i
dont
know
if
this
bottle
is
off
but
this
isnt
all
that
enjoyable
i
can
see
why
some
would
really
enjoy
this
but
it
just
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
d
ok
the
good
part
i
can
slam
this
very
drinkable
and
tasty
at
the
same
time
not
the
best
depiction
of
the
style
but
still
very
good
im
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
however
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
offers
a
unique
complexity
not
often
found
in
the
style
i
was
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
because
i
had
not
tried
this
beer
before
today
the
character
of
this
beer
is
for
what
other
brown
ale
brewers
should
strive
to
meet
so
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
its
great
and
its
different
i
really
think
they
pulled
off
the
whole
hazelnut
thing
which
i
was
very
skeptical
about
at
first
since
i
dont
really
like
hazelnut
coffee
or
anything
like
that
this
beer
is
an
exception
though
it
is
just
delicious
good
job
rogue
just
dont
trick
me
again
drinkability
i
gave
lowmarks
for
the
residual
slight
aftertaste
a
quaffer
not
a
sipper
pours
a
nice
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
as
it
recedes
just
a
little
bit
of
haze
to
the
body
of
they
with
some
red
hues
coming
through
the
aroma
is
unreal
on
this
brown
ale
big
time
hazelnut
aroma
like
fresh
toasted
hazelnuts
a
bit
of
honey
and
brown
sugar
on
the
nose
also
pretty
much
the
best
smelling
beer
ever
the
flavor
drops
off
for
me
a
bit
as
its
extremely
dry
and
get
a
hint
of
astringent
flavors
really
nutty
and
malty
with
very
little
hops
also
a
bit
thin
for
me
nice
lingering
sweet
flavors
of
roasted
hazelnuts
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
for
me
and
this
really
would
be
better
if
it
was
creamier
or
had
nitro
drinkability
is
good
and
this
beer
is
delicious
worth
the
4
99
a
bomber
and
would
really
open
up
with
some
roasted
pork
or
a
steak
sandwich
worth
a
try
but
only
once
despite
my
harsh
feelings
towards
hazelnuts
i
liked
this
carbonation
is
a
little
high
its
unlike
anything
ive
had
before
to
be
honest
the
hazlenut
is
as
pronounced
here
as
youll
find
it
anywhere
and
this
is
about
as
sweet
of
a
brown
ale
youll
find
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
believe
this
was
my
first
craft
brew
years
ago
brown
in
color
with
an
intense
hazenut
smell
big
nutty
flavor
smooth
malty
finish
if
you
love
hazenuts
you
will
love
this
brew
the
beer
brings
to
the
table
exactly
what
it
describes
one
of
my
first
brown
ales
and
one
that
i
still
visit
quite
often
notes
judging
from
the
high
reviews
this
beer
has
gotten
i
am
guessing
i
got
an
old
bottle
does
anyone
know
when
this
beer
is
brewed
so
i
can
get
a
fresh
bottle
a
unique
and
very
enjoyable
brew
i
really
like
hazelnut
and
the
flavor
definitely
makes
this
brew
stand
out
d
big
fan
wellbalanced
just
the
right
amount
of
hazelnut
had
it
with
homemade
chocolate
ice
cream
and
it
was
like
drinking
nutella
cheers
brown
nectar
is
one
of
those
beers
i
get
excited
about
no
matter
how
many
times
ive
had
it
and
whether
its
coming
to
me
from
a
bottle
or
ontap
every
time
i
have
this
beer
its
like
a
pickmeup
my
mood
goes
from
whatever
to
great
in
a
matter
of
sips
strong
hazelnut
flavor
from
a
rich
translucent
brown
body
with
medium
carbonation
and
foamy
head
i
highly
recommend
drinking
brown
nectar
in
a
bathtub
or
in
the
hot
sun
highly
refreshing
crisp
sweet
nutty
taste
from
my
experience
this
seems
to
be
the
case
with
rogue
they
dont
make
any
crazy
zany
beers
of
experimental
styles
or
in
the
hazy
realm
of
deep
palate
tasting
notes
rogue
makes
goodass
beers
in
whatever
department
they
chose
they
may
not
be
the
craziest
or
the
finest
but
dammit
theyre
the
beerest
coining
that
phrase
btw
nice
and
creamy
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
very
drinkable
so
long
as
you
want
a
nice
sweet
brew
certainly
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
around
very
drinkable
not
too
sweet
not
too
thin
or
thick
very
rich
flavored
not
your
traditional
brown
ale
but
its
something
you
wont
find
from
other
nut
browns
very
solid
beer
from
rogue
this
might
be
one
of
my
favorite
accessible
brown
ales
of
all
time
with
each
and
every
sip
i
just
crave
more
until
the
bottle
is
finished
great
value
and
great
taste
for
sure
cheers
i
dont
like
most
brown
ales
because
they
typically
have
a
sticky
starchy
sweetness
but
thankfully
this
isnt
like
that
its
more
crisp
d
very
good
brown
ale
with
a
dominant
nutty
character
and
sweet
flavor
accented
with
a
mild
hop
punch
good
stuff
d
a
nice
take
on
the
style
the
hazelnut
aspect
brings
is
a
welcome
addition
to
a
brown
ale
it
is
tasty
but
a
bomber
seems
to
be
a
bit
much
at
least
tonight
hazelnut
brown
nectar
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
almost
no
head
it
smelt
of
pure
liquified
hazelnut
the
taste
was
rather
similar
very
strong
hazlenut
flavor
was
expecting
a
much
stronger
ale
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
very
unquie
a
one
of
a
kind
overall
a
pretty
good
never
had
anything
like
it
worth
a
try
d
superb
drinkability
order
one
to
accompany
your
last
course
or
to
replace
your
last
course
this
might
be
one
of
my
favorite
accessible
brown
ales
of
all
time
with
each
and
every
sip
i
just
crave
more
until
the
bottle
is
finished
great
value
and
great
taste
for
sure
mfd
medium
to
fullbodied
a
good
tasty
drink
but
1
glass
was
enough
a
little
too
sweet
to
have
a
ton
of
but
a
good
brown
ale
i
might
like
this
better
in
colder
weather
or
with
dessert
very
easy
drinker
maybe
a
little
heavy
for
warm
weather
dperfect
brown
ale
could
drink
well
into
the
night
the
beer
is
very
clean
and
fresh
and
obviously
brewed
with
expertise
the
finish
is
exceptionally
quenching
with
soft
nuts
again
and
chewy
malts
there
are
no
traces
of
alcohol
or
off
flavors
here
and
overall
you
are
left
with
a
satisfying
nut
brown
which
is
excellent
on
its
own
or
with
meaty
dinner
dishes
i
actually
love
this
beer
in
the
summer
in
the
sun
it
is
great
with
a
picnic
filled
with
hearty
sandwiches
dark
breads
cheeses
and
fruit
d
this
is
overwhelmingly
drinkable
if
they
werent
as
costly
as
they
are
id
be
downing
these
more
often
go
easy
on
this
one
its
6
2
abv
in
a
very
big
bottle
good
for
a
dinner
party
especially
if
your
dinner
consists
of
beef
mdleaves
a
full
feeling
sweetness
in
your
mouth
that
just
leaves
you
wanting
more
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
unfortunately
so
did
my
wife
and
she
drank
the
majority
of
it
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
a
great
brew
which
people
should
be
paying
more
attention
to
overall
i
find
rogue
can
be
a
little
hit
or
miss
but
i
really
like
this
beer
definitely
one
of
my
new
favorite
brown
ales
definitely
glad
i
picked
one
up
taste
smooth
medium
body
with
loads
of
sweet
nutty
flavors
i
was
given
a
bottle
of
morimoto
hazelnut
signature
ale
at
a
dinner
club
but
we
didnt
get
to
it
so
i
ended
up
having
it
myself
this
brown
ale
has
a
luscious
brown
color
and
fine
carbonation
the
smell
is
toasty
like
a
freshly
baked
loaf
of
dark
rustic
bread
the
roast
malt
flavor
melded
well
with
caramel
and
biscuity
malt
in
providing
a
full
flavored
and
bodied
beer
hazelnut
was
apparent
in
the
aftertaste
and
helped
to
make
a
well
rounded
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
i
can
envision
myself
drinking
these
during
the
cold
winters
i
am
snowed
in
when
i
saw
this
bottle
with
chef
morimoto
on
it
and
knowing
my
wife
loves
hazelnut
i
figured
id
pick
it
up
to
try
poured
from
a
22oz
into
three
glasses
that
are
probably
better
suited
for
pilsners
a
nice
one
and
a
half
finger
foamy
head
erupted
on
top
of
a
nice
burnt
amber
red
highlighted
body
my
nhose
picked
up
vanilla
oak
and
malt
there
was
very
little
hazelnuttiness
about
this
beer
until
i
tasted
it
strong
hazelnut
in
the
back
with
not
much
else
going
on
i
feel
the
smell
was
more
complex
than
the
actual
taste
of
the
beer
it
was
mediumbodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
that
warming
alcohol
sensation
in
the
back
its
a
kind
of
nice
beer
but
not
my
thing
not
something
id
get
hooked
on
d
very
drinakble
beer
evn
though
it
was
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
went
really
well
pair
with
some
crumb
cake
dthis
is
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
very
refreshing
for
a
nutty
brown
ale
impressive
taste
is
hazelnut
up
front
then
joined
by
some
sweetish
toasty
maltiness
and
light
earthy
bitterness
to
balance
its
balanced
neither
too
bitter
nor
too
sweet
pretty
drinkable
and
the
character
is
as
said
clean
and
firm
however
the
hazelnut
definitely
dominates
and
too
much
in
my
opinion
rendering
it
rather
onedimensional
so
i
doubt
ill
actually
buy
it
again
hazelnut
to
me
can
be
good
in
beer
if
it
is
a
slight
additional
element
adding
to
complexity
of
a
beer
that
does
not
overall
taste
like
hazelnut
this
is
alright
as
a
change
of
pace
but
the
bomber
was
too
much
for
me
it
just
got
too
sweet
and
fake
tasting
would
absolutly
love
to
try
on
draft
22
oz
poured
into
an
arrogant
bastard
pint
33
ibus
this
brew
pours
a
deep
and
definite
brown
with
a
small
layer
of
head
the
aroma
is
magnificent
dark
malts
caramel
brown
sugar
and
roasted
nuts
the
taste
is
even
better
loads
of
brown
sugar
toffee
maltiness
caramel
and
yes
delicious
hazelnut
what
a
delicious
dessert
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
has
an
almost
ash
like
backward
flavor
it
carbonation
in
the
mouth
is
minimal
but
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
no
aftertaste
all
and
all
its
an
average
uninteresting
beer
do
your
like
hazelnut
iced
coffee
you
will
like
this
beer
then
had
it
on
tap
at
the
b
brown
smooth
rich
and
creamy
these
unique
beers
really
blow
my
mind
its
really
showing
off
in
a
good
way
and
i
love
it
to
brew
a
beer
that
tastes
like
an
iced
coffee
is
pretty
cool
skillz
so
bold
and
tasty
for
what
the
brewer
is
trying
to
accomplish
i
really
cant
imagine
better
results
i
still
have
yet
to
have
a
rogue
beer
i
did
not
enjoy
d
at
first
i
thought
i
dont
really
think
i
like
this
one
the
aroma
was
far
to
sweet
and
it
didnt
bring
enough
nutty
flavor
to
cut
through
the
malt
the
longer
it
sat
though
the
more
i
was
able
to
discern
the
rest
of
the
flavors
this
beer
has
to
offer
i
would
love
to
see
this
in
stout
form
with
darker
malts
it
would
be
like
ferrero
rocher
in
a
glass
d
its
medium
sweet
and
not
over
carbonated
i
would
call
this
a
great
evening
beer
but
not
quite
a
session
beer
unless
you
are
really
into
browns
a
little
sweet
for
that
perhaps
d
great
i
wont
have
any
problem
putting
away
this
bomber
best
brown
ive
had
i
think
not
my
favorite
style
at
all
though
now
i
want
to
try
more
but
id
definitely
drink
this
again
when
the
mood
strikes
nutty
and
malty
but
not
overly
thickening
thinner
than
the
appearance
kinda
tastes
like
it
has
oats
even
though
the
ingredients
say
no
such
thing
chocolate
nuts
very
slight
chocolate
a
real
malt
bomb
without
being
thick
not
for
hopheads
always
pricey
when
it
comes
to
these
guys
this
is
an
extremely
quaffable
beer
and
a
nice
option
for
a
bigger
while
not
big
beer
that
allows
you
to
down
a
few
nicely
done
this
one
is
now
in
my
rotation
in
fridge
soo
good
kicking
my
self
for
not
trying
it
sooner
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
i
would
get
this
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
something
darker
and
flavorful
but
doesnt
really
classify
as
a
big
beer
for
me
in
that
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
still
be
ok
with
it
very
solid
the
aroma
is
definitely
my
favorite
aspect
solid
brown
ale
overall
pours
a
brownamber
color
with
a
1
finger
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
great
a
strong
hazelnut
rush
and
a
hint
of
coco
the
beer
follows
the
aroma
rich
hazelnut
malt
is
the
showcase
in
this
beer
there
are
also
secondary
chocolate
caramel
and
vanilla
malts
present
great
rich
and
creamy
malts
throughout
light
hops
show
near
the
finish
but
it
finishes
sweet
as
the
malts
take
over
again
great
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
good
drinkability
very
good
beer
extremely
drinkable
brown
ale
d
a
very
nice
offering
from
rogue
not
really
suitable
for
the
humid
and
sweltering
day
that
i
drank
it
on
but
it
would
be
a
great
fall
beer
d
very
smooth
beer
because
of
the
low
carbonation
is
is
easily
drinkable
the
only
problem
is
how
sweet
it
is
making
it
slightly
less
drinkable
but
that
isnt
too
much
of
a
detriment
could
still
easily
have
a
few
bottles
in
a
sitting
d
pretty
drinkable
i
could
enjoy
a
few
bottles
very
nice
take
on
the
nut
brown
ale
with
the
inclusion
of
hazelnut
extract
this
is
one
awesome
beer
very
drinkable
similar
to
newcastle
brown
and
robert
the
bruce
i
love
this
beer
very
good
hazel
nut
taste
and
very
smoooth
one
of
my
favorites
dont
let
the
funky
label
keep
you
from
buying
this
beer
it
is
awesome
label
does
say
it
won
an
award
for
best
brown
ale
world
champion
and
i
believe
it
a
rating
ill
have
it
again
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
its
a
dark
redish
color
with
tan
lace
very
creamy
while
drinking
i
notice
a
nutty
particular
hazelnut
taste
with
a
very
malty
smell
not
too
much
carbonation
very
sweet
perfect
compliment
for
a
dessert
would
definitely
drink
it
again
and
again
final
notes
this
beer
just
isnt
really
doing
it
for
me
for
some
reason
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
again
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
either
if
youre
into
hazelnut
flavored
stuff
youll
probably
like
this
beer
if
not
my
favorite
style
a
very
nice
example
i
like
what
the
hazelnut
brings
to
the
table
a
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
which
is
what
i
prefer
this
is
probably
one
of
my
top
beers
and
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
every
night
great
job
rogue
brewery
and
because
of
this
smell
you
really
expect
the
beer
to
have
a
really
sweet
taste
but
it
doesnt
however
it
does
have
a
slight
sweet
taste
drinkability
very
drinkable
medium
body
but
very
smooth
w
just
a
touch
of
astringency
in
finish
mild
to
moderate
carbonation
gives
tingle
lift
and
creaminess
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
a
little
skeptical
about
this
beer
firstly
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
hazelnut
and
secondly
i
thought
the
beer
was
going
to
be
to
sweet
since
a
friend
of
mine
offered
it
to
me
how
could
i
refuse
free
beer
pouring
it
into
a
tulip
glass
a
reddish
brown
color
appearance
to
fill
the
glass
putting
the
glass
to
my
nose
the
aroma
was
very
nutty
i
took
my
first
sip
and
before
i
knew
it
it
was
also
my
last
sip
because
i
drank
it
all
in
one
swig
it
was
that
good
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
because
of
my
previous
misconceptions
about
this
brew
this
beer
will
be
a
mainstay
in
my
frig
for
a
while
fo
me
this
would
work
as
a
dessert
beer
or
night
cap
but
otherwise
the
flavor
is
a
bit
too
much
dark
brown
pour
with
a
foamy
2finger
offwhite
head
lots
of
toast
and
nuttiness
in
the
aroma
there
is
definitely
a
distinct
note
of
hazelnuts
and
some
floral
clover
and
honey
sweetness
along
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
hay
the
hops
add
just
a
touch
of
spice
and
pepper
to
the
nose
the
flavor
again
has
lots
of
hazelnut
character
with
hints
of
toast
cocoa
straw
clover
honey
wild
flowers
and
caramel
the
body
is
a
bit
thinnish
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
but
drinks
very
nicely
this
is
a
great
offering
one
of
my
favorites
from
rogue
nicely
complex
it
keeps
you
coming
back
for
more
without
growing
too
sweet
or
heavy
the
hazelnut
flavor
can
sometimes
tread
close
to
artificial
not
too
filling
but
still
outstanding

that
the

flavor
of
this

are
perfect
not

to

found
this
to
be
ok
but
thats
just
a
sneak
peak
at
the
taste
wow
does
this
count
as
dessert
i
first
noticed
some
espressofumes
and
cream
and
a
very
light
touch
of
diacetyl
big
notes
of
vanilla
which
is
to
be
expected
from
a
rogue
brew
in
good
condition
fresh
you
can
taste
the
hazelnut
or
as
oregonians
call
em
tiny
bubble
head
like
hazelnut
obviously

hazelnut
brown
nectar
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
it
pours
to
produce
a
light
tan
head
with
a
cloudy
and
dark
brown
body
thin
lacing
lasts
a
good
while
gives
off
a
slight
chocolaty
aroma
and
tastes
chocolaty
but
with
a
vivid
hazelnut
sweetness
drinkability
pretty
damn
good
in
moderation
im
enjoying
a
22oz
bottle
now
but
no
way
i
could
handle
any
more
than
that
terrific
desert
beer
or
delicious
when
following
a
brutal
bitter
dark
brown
brew
with
a
head
that
did
not
last
long
smells
of
hazelnut
coffee
this
was
bought
to
see
if
this
would
surpass
my
nutty
love
for
the
coffeehouse
porter
by
the
berkshire
brewing
company
it
did
not
it
is
not
bad
but
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
bite
body
to
make
me
happy
still
it
is
a
jolly
good
brew
by
rogue
will
have
again
hazy
brown
strong
hazelnut
flavor
that
following
their
chocolate
would
be
a
great
dessert
this
also
like
many
of
rogues
other
offerings
has
a
noticeably
accentuated
taste
flavor
and
experience
tasting
it
on
tap
as
compared
to
the
bottle
while
rogue
in
the
bottle
is
usually
very
good
tap
just
makes
the
beers
sing
poured
out
a
chocolate
brown
failry
clear
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
the
nose
was
sweet
full
of
hazelnut
creamy
with
some
mild
spicing
the
taste
was
a
little
watered
down
for
me
nice
hazelnut
flavor
kind
of
sweet
but
not
enough
body
or
malt
backing
this
guy
up
instead
of
being
a
nuance
the
hazelnut
was
the
main
attraction
here
a
decent
effort
but
this
needs
to
be
bigger
the
hazelnut
is
a
bit
too
cloying
for
me
have
another
definitely
the
best
nut
brown
ale
ive
tasted
hands
down
if
you
love
hazelnut
coffee
you
will
love
this
actually
if
you
love
good
beer
you
will
love
this
brown
ale
a
nice
dark
color
to
it
which
is
blood
red
when
you
hold
it
up
to
light
smell
is
of
hazelnut
and
malt
still
cant
believe
how
good
this
was
i
dont
want
to
say
too
much
you
just
need
to
go
out
and
try
it
my
ratings
say
it
all
excellent
brew
great
drinkability
my
only
regret
is
i
bought
only
one
of
these
i
will
be
stocking
up
like
many
of
rogues
offerings
this
beer
is
unique
and
enjoyable
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
i
return
to
regularly
very
drinkable
i
got
this
brew
at
tanks
taproom
in
tampa
fl
it
poured
a
deep
brown
with
two
fingers
of
a
light
brown
head
the
retention
was
medium
to
fast
and
produced
little
if
any
lacing
the
smell
was
a
very
sweet
hoppy
smell
the
taste
was
pretty
malty
almost
giving
the
drinker
a
woody
sense
as
in
trees
not
the
other
thing
this
brew
went
down
very
smooth
and
was
a
good
purchase
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
right
on
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
finished
off
the
rest
of
the
22
oz
immediately
left
me
wanting
another
i
had
this
beer
last
night
at
redbones
ive
always
wanted
to
try
it
so
to
see
it
on
tap
was
rather
nice
since
it
was
dark
in
the
room
it
was
hard
to
judge
the
color
but
the
heading
was
pretty
nice
looking
in
the
smell
was
plenty
of
chocolate
honey
and
sweet
sugar
taste
woah
this
one
was
really
sweet
to
the
point
of
being
a
bit
too
sweet
having
said
that
the
nectar
side
of
the
beer
gave
it
a
nice
presence
mouthfeel
was
about
medium
i
would
say
one
was
more
then
enough
for
me
for
no
other
reason
but
that
it
was
just
too
sweet
for
my
palate
maybe
ill
pick
up
a
bomber
of
it
to
see
if
there
are
any
significant
differences
cheers
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a

tint

is
thin
and
dissipates
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
roasted
malt
and
hazelnut
is
present
in
the
scent
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
bready
smell
from
the
malt
taste
is
bready
and
roasted
full
bodied
and
not
very
carbonated
easy
to
drink
drinkability
definately
though
this
is
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
all
night
as
it
is
fairly
heavy
but
i
could
definately
sit
down
and
easily
finish
a
six
pack
drinkability
this
is
rich
hearty
and
excellent
and
its
very
sessionable
drinkability

please

more

if

the
addition
of
hazelnut
nectar
is
well
placed
in
this
brew
mouthfell
is
a
little
winey
maybe
due
to
sugars
added
to
maintain
the

tastes
of
chocolate
and
hazelnut
flavored
coffee
without
cream
medium
finish
id
like
a
touch
more
depth
but
its
darn
tasty
stuff
a
bit
too
bubbly
at
first
but
a
smooth
finish
very
easy
to
drink
d
the
heavy
mouthfeel
and
abundance
of
sweet
flavors
keep
this
from
being
a
session
beer
as
many
browns
are
but
thats
not
really
a
complaint
this
is
a
very
nice
desserttype
beer
great
to
have
occasionally
note
the
quality
control
on
this
beer
much
like
the
roque
red
leaves
something
to
desired
try
it
if
you
dont
like
it
wait
a
few
weeks
and
then
get
another
bottle
from
a
different
store
ala
cuisine
oh
and
the
guy
on
the
bottle
looks
just
like
my
brother
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
it
smells
like
nuts
roasted
malt
and
some
caramel
it
tastes
mostly
like
chocolate
and
hazelnuts
and
theres
also
some
caramel
and
malt
taste
with
a
small
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
a
little
bit
creamy
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
too
i
wouldnt
have
many
problems
drinking
2
or
3
bombers
of
this
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
then
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
bad
beer
from
rogue
drinkability
very
luxurious
and
tasty
yet
complex
and
easy
to
drink
this
may
be
my
favorite
rogue
brew
yet
the
hazelnut
comes
through
strongly
in
the
taste
and
smell
especially
in
a
fresh
batch
like
this
roasted
malt
caramel
undertones
subdued
hoppiness
very
dry
stuff
especially
in
the
finish
its
on
the
lighter
side
of
mediumbodied
with
pretty
light
carbonation
very
smooth
and
refreshing
this
stuff
is
infinitely
drinkable
a
nice
drinking
refreshing
beer
a
750ml
bottle
purchased
from
a
small
packie
was
a
little
dusty
so
it
age
may
be
why
it
turned
out
to
be
a
disappointment
inital
pour
was
impressive
nice
clear
caramel
brown
color
good
head
and
excellent
aroma
distinct
hazelnut
odor
along
with
caramel
and
sweet
malt
aromas
my
expectations
were
dashed
once
i
tasted
it
though
initally
sweet
the
beer
lacks
any
aftertaste
as
well
as
any
hazelnut
or
any
kind
of
nutty
undertone
the
head
quickly
dissipated
and
it
ended
up
tasting
very
flat
again
it
may
be
caused
by
an
old
bottle
worth
trying
again
but
dont
get
your
hopes
up
another
from
the
pdq
market
pours
a
attractive
dark
brown
smells
lightly
like
sweet
malt
tastes
quite
nicely
of
sweet
malt
some
nutty
bitterness
and
some
toasty
malts
a
bit
like
some
porters
ive
had
in
the
past
overallits
different
from
other
brown
ales
ive
had
and
probably
what
a
brown
ale
is
supposed
to
be
like
i
like
it
and
recommend
it
a
great
beer
that
i
will
definitely
purchase
again
note
to
self
ranked
the
9
american
brown
ale
need
to
have
it
again
pours
to
a
dark
brown
color
with
ruby
tint
and
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
lingers
for
most
of
the
glass
and
leads
to
good
lacing
nice
sweet
malty
aroma
of
roasted
nuts
and
hints
of
chocolate
flavor
is
more
of
the
malty
sweet
roastednut
flavor
some
alcohol
blended
in
nicely
at
midglass
all
which
contributed
to
a
good
long
finish
i¬ím
normally
not
a
fan
of
brown
ales
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
drink
at
cellar
temperature
for
best
flavor
its
cloyingly
sweet
but
not
unpleasantly
so
certainly
not
something
to
pull
out
of
the
fridge
during
the
ballgame
an
event
beer
companys
coming
lets
get
a
bottle
or
two
of
hazelnut
brown
nectar
for
dessert
d
this
is
alright
no
my
cup
of
tea
the
hazelnut
is
a
bit
sweet
to
me
so
i
cant
imagine
drinking
much
of
this
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
though
a
little
sticky
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
however
so
ill
take
my
time
finishing
this
one
off
ill
definitely
buy
again
but
i
doubt
ill
ever
have
two
backtoback
cant
drink
this
again
nothing
there
to
hang
my
hat
on
from
rogue
hmm
maybe
this
was
a
bad
bottle
d
awesome
drink
it
as
much
as
you
can
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
syrupy
and
full
but
also
wellcarbonated
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
assuming
that
you
really
like
hazelnut
if
you
dont
well
then
one
glass
will
probably
be
your
limit
wavz
overall
a
nice
brown
ale
this
1
is
a
perfect
dinner
beer
d
umm
wow
this
is
fantastic
the
flavor
is
very
complex
each
sip
brings
out
a
different
aspect
nutty
roasty
sweet
bitter
this
is
the
first
brown
ale
ive
had
that
brought
all
my
tastebuds
to
life
just
looking
at
the
beer
makes
it
looklike
itll
be
too
heavy
to
drink
damn
those
tv
commercials
but
my
god
did
rogue
surprise
me
i
have
to
get
another
one
of
these
beers
its
just
a
shame
the
smallest
packaging
for
hazelnut
is
22oz
and
not
6packs
anyway
way
to
go
rogue
sensational
brew
slainte
the
mouth
is
light
to
medium
a
little
bright
on
the
front
dry
semidry
and
nutty
on
the
finish
its
drinkable
but
after
sampling
it
both
ontap
and
in
the
bottle
i
doubt
i
will
give
it
another
taste
i
think
it
was
better
overall
in
the
bottlebetter
carbonation
and
complexity
but
it
failed
to
knock
my
socks
off
in
either
format
i
would
suggest
looking
elsewhere
in
the
rogue
catalogue
overall
nicely
balanced
and
not
too
sweet
poured
a
very
deep
dark
brown
with
a
medium
sized
head
aroams
is
of
musch
malts
some
nuttyhazelnut
smell
mildly
roasty
the
taste
is
mainly
of
roasty
maltiness
with
a
bit
of
nutty
hazelnut
flavor
in
there
bit
of
creamyness
to
the
texture
the
hop
bitterness
works
its
way
in
there
though
a
very
quaffable
brew
indeed
nice
american
brown
ale
this
is
a
great
brew
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
at
one
sitting
the
guys
at
rogue
have
it
going
on
d
another
great
rogue
product
and
a
great
brown
ale
definitely
the
best
brown
ale
from
any
country
that
ive
had
to
date
the
flavors
are
very
complex
with
an
excellent
nutty
character
to
the
beer
a
superbly
smooth
and
wonderfully
carbonated
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
a
definite
repeatpleaser
a
must
have
once
or
twice
or
three
times
you
get
the
point
what
a
treat
rogue
definitely
hits
off
a
balance
of
flavor
with
this
one
bouncing
a
number
of
matching
notes
off
the
malty
side
of
this
brew
a
22
oz
bomber
is
a
great
way
to
cap
off
the
night
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
have
been
rather
shy
of
rogues
beers
that
arent
stouts
because
they
are
often
imo
undrinkably
bitter
and
linger
like
you
ate
a
piece
of
chalk
this
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
and
actually
lets
the
malt
take
a
shot
at
the
lead
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
again
so
there
you
have
it
dhopefully
i
just
had
a
bad
bottle
the
metallic
taste
and
smell
was
pretty
overwhelming
i
can
see
this
being
a
good
regular
beer
to
have
on
a
average
night
goes
down
quite
easy
i
have
been
a
sucker
for
hazelnut
beers
after
falling
in
love
with
rogues
hazelnut
ale
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
mostly
sweet
like
artificial
sweetener
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
light
and
doesn¬ít
really
take
shape
til
about
34
of
the
way
through
it
has
kind
of
a
syruplike
consistency
but
that
sweet
hazelnut
taste
adds
such
a
wonderful
kiss
to
the
brown
taste
it
is
basically
nonexistent
for
the
majority
of
the
mouthfeel
but
after
the
beer
goes
down
the
aftertaste
is
totally
dominated
by
it
quite
a
special
beer
note
since
i
reviewed
this
beer
i
have
been
drinking
one
of
these
almost
everynight
its
damn
addictive
and
damn
good
i
had
to
jack
up
some
of
my
points
because
of
that
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
body
comes
off
as
a
bit
heavy
sometimes
but
this
is
a
very
tasty
very
good
beer
thank
you
rogue
for
coming
the
gcbf
flavors
are
similar
to
smell
with
a
very
slight
hazelnut
finish
it
is
remarkably
smooth
fitting
for
an
iron
chef
i
enjoyed
drinking
the
beer
and
it
was
unique
for
the
style
if
not
for
the
hazelnut
than
for
the
smoothness
not
too
bad
the
smell
is
really
the
highlight
here
d
refreshing
22
oz
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
looks
amazing
very
dark
brown
in
appearance
with
a
nice
fluffy
brown
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
sweet
coffee
and
also
some
yeasty
bread
with
a
bit
of
sweet
honey
taste
is
amazing
it
honestly
to
me
taste
like
a
weaker
imperial
stout
very
similar
in
taste
just
not
with
that
alcohol
bite
i
can
taste
coffee
roasted
nuts
bread
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
there
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
this
fine
offering
from
rogue
and
i
believe
i
just
found
my
new
favorite
from
the
brewers
on
the
bay
simply
amazing
d
very
drinkable
this
is
an
awesome
brew
from
rogue
highly
recommended
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
color
ale
with
a
foamy
dark
head
with
average
retention
aroma
is
nutty
from
the
hazelnut
flavour
and
malty
with
some
roastiness
taste
is
quite
enjoyable
with
the
hazelnut
easily
identifiable
and
roasted
malt
balancing
everything
else
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
very
good
session
beer
it
is
drinkable
but
seems
to
lack
direction
had
it
been
maltier
or
hoppier
or
even
had
a
more
pronounced
hazelnut
signature
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
one
more
this
was
the
first
and
only
time
i
have
been
underwhelmed
by
a
rogue
product
overall
a
great
beer
overall
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
recommended
a
touch
rich
for
me
to
drink
all
night
but
easy
going
down
nonetheless
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
striding
the
line
between
sipper
from
the
sweetness
rather
than
abv
and
a
session
beer
i¬íd
drink
it
again
but
wouldn¬ít
choose
it
over
other
rogue
brews
i¬íve
had
another
winner
from
rogue
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
hides
its
abv
well
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
was
over
6
after
tasting
it
cheers2beers
i
was
impressed
by
the
appearance
of
this
beer
as
it
poured
darker
than
i
expected
with
a
dark
brown
body
that
was
a
little
ruby
when
held
to
light
light
nose
left
me
unsure
what
to
expect
out
of
the
taste
beyond
the
expected
nuttiness
the
tase
was
very
malted
with
nut
taste
predominant
and
fruity
nuances
enough
hops
to
balance
the
smoky
nutty
early
tastes
all
in
all
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
visit
again
cant
sing
too
many
praises
about
rogue
that
havent
already
been
sung
tasty
tasty
tasty
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
a
definite
improvement
on
the
typical
brown
ale
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
cream
colored
persistent
head
it
definitely
smells
nutty
you
can
also
smell
caramel
and
malt
the
taste
is
sweeter
than
most
beers
and
the
nut
flavor
is
pronounced
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
smooth
i
would
consider
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
nut
browns
which
i
am
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
dessert
anyone
drinkability
the
complex
and
friendly
taste
make
this
beer
incredibly
quaffable
i
hope
to
try
it
on
tap
soon
best
brown
ale
thus
far
definitely
a
divine
nectar
a
really
wonderful
brew
with
a
unique
flavour
profile
trust
rogue
to
put
out
a
world
class
specimen
that
doesnt
quite
fit
the
style
profile
exactly
but
projects
excellence
nonetheless
this
would
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
if
it
was
available
here
pours
a
dark
brown
maple
color
with
a
tan
head
smells
sweet
with
syrup
and
hazelnut
not
too
much
else
except
sweet
notes
taste
is
similar
a
light
body
good
carbonation
a
very
sweet
nut
brown
with
some
malty
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
has
a
good
balance
of
taste
carbonation
and
smell
a
well
rounded
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
would
recommend
this
to
all
especiall
nut
brown
lovers
this
is
a
good
beer
enjoy
poured
out
of
its
22oz
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
with
mahogany
hues
when
held
up
to
the
light
pour
produces
a
light
tan
head
that
quickly
turns
into
a
thin
lace
on
top
this
is
a
deliciously
smelling
brew
nose
is
nutty
with
sweet
roasted
malt
with
a
little
cocoa
as
well
taste
begins
sweet
with
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
that
finishes
with
a
dry
nuttiness
and
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
clean
the
palate
mouthfeel
i
feel
is
a
little
to
light
for
a
brown
overall
this
is
another
good
offering
from
rogue
i
feel
dirty
drinkability
if
you
are
a
brown
ale
fan
should
be
quite
good
taste
a
proper
extention
of
the
smell
chocolate
coffee
nuts
currants
malty
and
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
since
i
was
drinking
it
for
dessert
may
be
too
sweet
for
dinner
cheers
this
beer
came
to
the
table
as
a
black
beer
with
no
head
the
smell
was
nutty
with
a
strong
hazelnut
scent
the
taste
was
similar
with
a
good
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
moderate
and
smooth
of
the
nut
brown
beers
this
is
probably
the
best
ive
had
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
beer
may
change
my
mind
now
if
they
could
just
sell
this
stuff
in
12
oz
at
cheaper
prices
medium
bodied
i
won¬ít
get
this
one
again
but
because
of
the
hazelnuts
¬ñ
did
i
mention
i
the
hazelnuts
nauseate
me
this
was
a
pretty
onesided
beer
not
much
going
on
with
the
hops
at
all
a
nice
offering
from
rogue
although
their
bombers
continue
to
be
a
bit
overpriced
dark
reddish
copper
with
a
mediumsmall
pillowy
light
tan
slowly
diminishing
head
like
the
bottle
says
there¬ís
lots
of
nuts
in
the
nose
moderately
sweetsmelling
and
malty
with
aromas
of
chocolate
juicy
hops
a
little
spice
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
sweet
and
all
about
the
hazelnut
supporting
cast
of
bready
malts
light
cherry
and
wood
it
has
a
medium
body
very
smooth
texture
and
soft
carbonation
this
is
an
impressive
easydrinker
and
interesting
little
twist
on
the
style
certainly
worth
trying
aftertaste
slightly
hazelnut
extract
but
the
hops
makes
for
a
pleasant
drying
that
makes
you
want
for
another
sip
d
most
beers
that
try
to
have
a
nutty
flavor
just
never
pull
it
off
this
is
one
of
the
few
that
does
it
has
a
nice
complex
malty
flavor
that
is
still
a
fullbodied
session
beer
it
is
almost
a
desert
with
the
slight
sweetness
big
creaminess
and
nice
nuttiness
all
it
is
missing
is
a
big
alcohol
taste
and
you
have
desert
in
a
glass
pours
a
lovely
deep
reddishbrown
with
a
tall
and
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
rich
and
nutty
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
some
roasted
malts
rounding
it
out
wonderfully
warm
and
inviting
taste
is
malty
up
front
with
lots
of
lightly
roasted
chocolate
and
spices
being
overtaken
by
the
nuttiness
that
builds
a
finish
that
goes
on
and
on
a
touch
of
hoppiness
livens
up
this
nicely
complex
ale
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
thicker
but
is
well
carbonated
and
warming
and
drinkability
is
very
good
though
the
richness
and
complexity
makes
one
want
to
slow
down
and
appreciate
it
fully
just
a
great
beer
certainly
my
favourite
brown
ale
to
date
about
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
i¬íve
had
it
built
up
and
it
did
not
disappoint
cheers
this
one
displays
a
dark
brown
body
with
ruby
highlights
showing
through
all
over
the
place
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
quite
sweet
with
extracted
vanilla
and
a
lot
of
nuttiness
coming
through
tasting
this
the
first
thing
to
leap
out
is
some
pinprick
carbonation
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
along
with
a
typical
nut
brown
sourness
at
the
back
of
the
palate
then
a
smooth
hazelnut
vanilla
and
sugar
sweetness
comes
through
the
finish
is
on
the
smokey
side
and
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
silky
and
smooth
overall
this
beer
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
but
its
still
quite
good
and
would
make
quite
a
good
dessert
beer
id
imagine
wow
this
is
sweet
this
dark
brown
beer
with
the
slight
reddish
tint
and
decent
tan
head
has
a
smell
that
only
hints
at
the
toasty
carameltoffee
liquid
candy
goodness
that
is
rogues
hazelnut
brown
nectar
smooth
malts
and
nuttiness
anyone
would
be
hard
pressed
to
beat
drinkable
quite
if
you
like
your
tongue
to
dance
from
the
sweetness
rogue
i
pump
my
fist
in
your
honor
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
want
one
as
a
nightcap
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
dessert
beer
also
might
be
good
to
break
in
a
nonba
with
a
very
good
beer
my
third
beer
from
rogue
and
after
the
mocha
porter
and
the
chocolate
stout
i
am
looking
forward
to
this
sweeter
and
less
roasty
offering
650ml
tasted
at
cellar
temperature
poured
out
wow
quite
dark
for
a
brown
a
nice
solidlooking
deep
tawny
chestnut
held
to
light
it
shows
some
nice
nearruby
light
purple
hues
the
head
is
oatmealcoloured
and
left
full
but
fast
moving
lace
a
definite
beauty
of
a
brown
ale
to
look
at
the
first
aroma
mmmm
butterscotch
and
creamy
hazelnut
sweet
and
big
on
the
caramel
malts
almost
like
coffee
flavouring
vanilla
and
hazel
the
prominent
notes
here
are
the
toffee
butterscotch
and
caramel
and
its
really
quite
delicious
to
smell
better
than
the
chocolate
stout
and
mocha
porter
for
me
it
really
reminds
me
of
a
flavoured
coffee
because
it
does
have
a
milky
almost
buttery
profile
as
well
the
malting
is
strong
and
balanced
and
the
hops
are
really
hard
to
find
behind
all
the
sweetness
other
sweet
notes
candy
apple
chocolate
raisins
prunes
some
rummy
sugariness
and
even
a
little
spicy
phenol
a
real
pleasure
to
inhale
taste
rummy
sweetness
and
butterscotch
on
the
tongue
right
away
a
bit
mild
but
sweet
in
the
middle
and
leaving
with
yes
hazelnut
and
more
coffee
flavour
than
the
nose
suggested
light
chocolate
and
a
less
fullflavour
than
the
aroma
might
have
led
me
to
believe
but
this
is
still
extremely
tasty
a
lovely
aftertaste
that
lingers
full
with
nuttiness
and
caramel
vanilla
and
cinnamon
bread
very
creamy
with
coffeeflavouring
a
brown
sugar
flavour
here
too
that
almost
reminds
me
of
some
belgian
dubbels
a
ton
of
toffeecandy
sweetness
awesome
the
mouthfeel
is
the
only
nitpicking
territory
i
found
it
a
little
weak
and
watery
at
the
finishit
could
use
just
a
tad
more
body
because
the
lack
of
it
adds
a
hardwater
flavour
the
beer
could
do
without
low
carbonation
i
could
drink
these
all
night
and
give
me
this
over
their
chocolate
stout
anyday
solid
dark
brown
in
colour
with
medium
carbonation
but
poor
head
retention
strong
malty
aromas
along
with
the
typical
rogue
pacman
yeasty
touch
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
initial
flavors
of
munich
malts
and
a
bit
of
soft
fruit
give
way
to
the
more
drying
chocolate
malt
and
nut
flavors
i
think
it¬ís
more
sesame
than
hazelnut
but
the
nut
element
is
definitely
there
there¬ís
a
bit
of
a
sour
twang
not
from
infection
on
the
finish
that
i
didn¬ít
really
like
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
am
impressed
i
expected
to
like
this
but
it
has
surpassed
all
expectations
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
i
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
to
enjoy
so
sweet
a
friend
of
mine
recommended
it
to
me
a
while
back
and
i
bought
one
i
liked
it
then
well
he
passed
away
a
few
months
ago
so
i
always
think
of
him
when
i
see
this
one
and
his
words
when
he
described
it
soo
tasty
very
enjoyable
beer
though
drinkability
is
for
me
not
enough
to
go
out
and
buy
more
but
enough
to
wait
until
i
feel
the
need
or
craving
again
and
the
opportunity
arrises
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
with
a
creamy
touch
this
is
a
nearing
perfect
balance
between
sweet
and
spicy
bitterness
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
treat
sadly
the
beer
was
departing
my
glass
to
fast
i
wish
i
had
purchased
a
few
more
of
these
goodies
dark
brown
with
a
red
hue
to
it
has
a
almost
tan
colored
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
smell
as
expected
is
very
nutty
hazelnut
and
i
thought
maybe
even
a
cocoa
smell
to
it
taste
is
definately
full
of
hazelnut
and
i
notice
the
cocoa
more
in
the
taste
than
the
smell
with
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
finish
light
in
body
and
highly
carbonated
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
can
see
myself
having
again
this
beer
tastes
amazing
it
starts
off
with
a
very
light
roasted
bitterness
that
splashes
right
into
a
deep
nutty
flavor
before
going
to
molasses
flavors
that
can
even
have
some
chocolate
tones
creamyass
mouthfeel
nectar
indeed
pours
a
very
pretty
brown
with
supple
but
swiftly
receding
head
it
smells
nutty
the
taste
starts
with
chocolate
malt
and
finishes
with
a
kick
of
hazlenut
it
is
not
syrupy
but
the
hazlenut
finish
is
a
bit
dominant
for
my
liking
d
this
beer
leaves
me
not
wanting
another
one
i
dont
think
i
could
suggest
this
to
a
friend
at
all
served
cool
in
an
imperial
pint
has
a
big
brown
head
to
begin
with
that
fades
quickly
kind
of
expected
from
a
brown
ale
very
deep
brown
in
color
with
very
little
lacing
hazelnut
is
the
overwhelming
aroma
here
the
flavor
is
absolutley
amazing
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
malts
are
all
present
to
begin
with
and
then
you
are
hit
with
an
amazing
wave
of
hazelnut
very
thick
and
rich
in
the
mouth
incredibly
drinkable
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
although
you
could
drink
this
all
night
this
beer
definitely
deserves
the
number
one
spot
for
brown
ales
definitely
a
must
have
brown
ale
for
anyone
i
was
slightly
dissapointed
overall
bitterness
and
clouds
the
nuttiness
and
i
feel
like
there
are
better
versions
of
brown
ale
out
there
for
similar
prices
in
a
pinch
id
reach
for
this
one
again
rubycopper
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
toffee
elements
candysweet
kind
of
reminds
me
of
saranac
caramel
porter
on
the
palate
sweet
caramel
candy
flavors
appear
first
followed
by
a
nutty
roasty
malt
element
a
firm
bitterness
prevails
from
midpalate
through
the
finish
with
the
aftertaste
being
highlighted
by
a
hazelnut
element
that
heretofore
had
manifested
itself
to
varying
degrees
throughout
the
palate
im
quite
impressed
by
how
the
caramel
and
hazelnut
flavors
work
in
concert
with
the
pleasingly
firm
bitter
and
astringent
elements
bravo
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
but
i
feel
that
if
it
had
a
thicker
body
i
would
appreciate
it
more
no
knock
on
rogue
though
as
this
is
a
topnotch
session
beer
the
6
2
is
completely
unnoticable
beer
poured
a
deep
mahoganybrown
with
little
head
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
with
a
hint
of
nuts
taste
is
heavy
on
sweet
maltiness
but
is
offset
nicely
by
a
subtle
dry
hop
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
outstanding
very
full
for
the
style
and
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
nice
and
lively
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
a
top
three
beer
for
this
months
beer
club
meeting
very
dark
with
a
crimson
tinge
looks
about
as
i
would
think
a
hazlenut
flavored
ale
should
sweet
nutty
odor
tastes
like
a
milkshake
chocolatey
and
nutty
hazlenut
is
very
tame
overall
very
sweet
which
i
didnt
actually
think
was
a
good
thing
with
a
hazlenut
finish
a
bit
thin
for
the
milkshakelike
taste
too
sweet
for
drinking
a
lot
of
this
reminded
me
a
lot
of
rogues
chocostout
both
are
sweeter
than
id
like
dark
brown
dark
copper
in
color
with
a
half
inch
beige
head
rich
nutty
smell
with
notes
of
malt
and
barley
wonderful
taste
good
carbonation
and
well
balanced
beer
with
a
disticnt
nutty
finish
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
drinking
a
good
standard
for
a
brown
ale
would
love
to
consume
a
few
if
i
found
it
on
tap
drinkability
drink
up
bitches
i
received
a
nice
pour
with
a
short
off
white
head
the
beer
appeared
to
be
lightly
carbonated
the
beers
color
apeared
an
incredibly
deep
clear
brown
big
malts
with
overtones
of
the
name
hits
it
hazelnut
rides
through
the
nose
the
beer
itself
tasted
sweet
perpetually
teetering
near
the
edge
of
being
overly
so
but
never
becomes
too
sweet
for
my
taste
the
beer
is
big
on
the
slightly
roasted
malt
flavors
along
with
the
nutty
flavors
the
low
level
of
carbonation
aids
in
giving
it
a
rich
full
mouthfeel
too
a
slight
nice
bit
of
bitterness
comes
at
the
very
end
as
the
beer
roles
of
the
mouth
this
is
like
a
nice
dessert
in
a
glass
its
a
drinkable
beer
even
with
its
sweetness
another
winner
from
rogue
drinkability
¬ñ
rogue
made
a
simple
style
into
a
¬ìbig
beer
¬î
great
flavor
high
drinkabilty
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
thick
head
from
a
brown
22
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
nutty
and
even
smells
a
bit
sweet
i
really
like
the
taste
of
this
one
hazelnut
is
definitely
prominent
and
makes
for
a
nice
addition
to
this
brown
ale
this
is
one
i
revisit
from
time
to
time
and
im
never
disappointed
drinkability
excellent
and
unique
very
easy
to
drink
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
too
sweet
and
fake
to
be
drinkable
feels
like
i
am
drinking
some
sweet
ass
coffee
yuck
i
wasn¬ít
sure
what
to
think
when
buying
this
beer
cause
amber
nut
browns
are
one
of
my
least
liked
styles
i¬ím
really
glad
i
did
as
a
result
of
not
being
to
fond
of
the
style
i
though
this
was
a
great
beer
the
deep
amber
color
is
complemented
by
a
milky
thick
body
of
tiny
bubbles
i¬íve
never
had
an
amber
be
so
complex
it
has
a
strong
caramel
taste
and
i
get
hints
of
smoked
bacon
this
would
be
great
with
a
ham
the
nose
has
a
strong
sent
of
brown
sugar
the
finish
leaves
a
great
sticky
smoky
brown
sugar
taste
in
your
mouth
mouth
feel
is
very
impressive
it
feels
a
lot
lighter
then
it
looks
making
it
go
down
maybe
a
little
too
quick
this
is
the
master
of
nutbrowns
sampled
at
brick
store
pub
with
the
atlanta
b
a
crew
hops
and
added
flavour
are
browns
needed
if
i
am
going
to
have
this
it
might
as
well
be
ontap
colourbrown
i
can
see
it
appealing
to
some
people
and
transitioning
from
coolers
a
bit
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
palate
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
by
this
brew
pours
out
to
a
medium
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
of
foam
no
lace
aromas
of
nuts
light
malts
vanilla
taste
wasnt
all
that
great
for
me
some
nuttiness
was
overturned
on
the
palate
with
an
array
of
flavors
vanilla
bean
herbs
caramel
touches
of
leather
too
much
going
on
and
not
enough
standing
out
mouthfeel
was
typical
for
a
brown
ale
rather
calm
with
some
syrupy
element
about
itself
fair
drinkability
worth
a
try
ive
had
this
more
than
a
few
times
recently
on
both
draft
and
from
bottle
this
beer
is
fabulous
what
a
funky
appearance
very
dirty
looking
brown
with
smoky
attributes
throughout
this
is
one
fine
and
easy
drinking
brew
tastes
of
what
else
but
hazlenut
toffee
caramel
nice
malty
sweetness
good
beer
to
get
your
domestic
drinking
friends
to
try
not
sure
how
you
couldnt
like
this
one
ive
revised
this
review
after
my
second
bottle
months
later
because
that
second
bottle
seemed
much
rounder
and
fuller
than
the
first
no
real
complaints
and
im
glad
i
gave
it
second
chance
drinkability
will
have
more
again
in
near
future
mmm
donuts
this
beer
is
really
great
i
would
look
at
it
as
a
desert
beer
a
very
different
beer
for
me
and
excellently
made
i
could
go
for
this
and
a
big
piece
of
tiramisu
or
coffee
cake
delicious
drinnkability
not
sure
that
i
could
do
more
than
a
bomber
of
this
leaves
you
feeling
kinda
full
somehow
like
a
piece
of
cheesecake
d
i
really
like
this
beer
unfortunately
a
22oz
bomber
goes
for
5
50
so
i
wont
be
buying
this
too
often
no
abv
listed
but
it
doesnt
seem
too
high
or
at
least
i
cant
taste
it
this
beer
would
be
perfect
with
a
nice
steak
fantastic
smooth
light
and
creamy
i
dont
care
for
brown
ales
but
ill
have
this
again
overall
this
one
definitely
does
the
style
justice
and
in
my
opinion
is
worth
a
taste
if
youve
never
had
it
the
bottle
recommends
serving
with
beef
or
pork
but
i
think
this
would
make
a
much
better
dessert
beer
ideally
with
a
huge
slice
of
chocolate
cake
i
like
rogue
well
enough
but
this
beer
is
just
too
fake
please
please
dont
add
anything
to
your
beers
especially
not
syrup
it
kills
the
carbonation
and
makes
this
taste
totally
unlike
beer
mouthfeel
a
little
rich
but
nothing
to
overpower
the
palate
very
nutty
but
a
veryy
good
nutty
22
ounce
bottle
hazlenut
brown
nectar
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
delicious
aroma
of
toffee
chocolate
and
nuts
rich
malty
flavor
this
beer
is
sweet
but
it
never
comes
close
to
being
cloying
the
sweet
chocolate
flavor
gives
way
to
a
toasted
malt
flavor
in
the
middle
this
is
accompanied
by
hazlenuts
very
slight
fruity
flavors
the
finish
is
a
little
hoppy
but
overall
this
is
mainly
about
the
malt
medium
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
ill
admit
ive
not
always
been
the
biggest
nut
beer
fan
but
this
one
changes
my
perspective
the
hazelnut
is
a
wonderful
acompaniment
to
everything
else
this
beer
has
to
offer
and
it
delivers
a
blended
distinguished
flavor
for
your
trouble
while
it
could
almost
be
seen
as
a
varietal
beer
i
think
it
could
be
enjoyed
any
time
as
drinkable
as
any
beer
of
its
type
im
not
going
to
say
i
will
become
the
biggest
nut
beer
fan
out
there
but
i
will
certainly
be
willing
to
visit
the
realm
more
often
and
thats
because
of
this
fine
example
drinkability
i
could
sip
this
all
night
i
chose
it
as
my
postfinals
celebration
beer
and
what
a
good
choice
i
just
wish
i
had
more
d
one
has
to
be
a
fan
of
roasted
nut
and
coffee
flavors
to
enjoy
this
beer
the
essence
of
these
two
foods
dominate
its
makeup
that
being
said
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
that
while
not
proper
for
a
session
would
be
enjoyable
throughout
the
day
with
its
rich
aromas
and
moderately
complex
taste
profile
poured
into
my
pilsner
glass
pours
a
caramel
brown
color
and
leaves
a
tan
head
that
did
not
stick
around
for
too
long
smells
of
nuts
caramel
and
malt
nice
taste
of
hazelnut
and
brown
sugar
nice
mouth
feel
with
good
carbonation
i
love
this
beer
it
puts
newcastle
to
shame
i
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
its
delicious
it
pours
a
dark
amber
brownish
color
hue
with
a
decent
head
that
hold
fairly
well
but
does
not
lace
very
well
it
smells
wonderfully
nutty
and
sweet
it
almost
smells
like
hazelnut
coffee
it
tastes
a
hint
of
peanutbutter
but
roasted
hazelnut
malts
dominate
the
overall
flavor
it
holds
decently
in
ones
mouth
but
it
could
be
a
little
more
forceful
overall
it
another
great
brew
from
rogue
overall
easy
to
drink
but
could
use
a
bit
mroe
bitterness
to
fill
in
for
some
sweetness
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
a
thin
wispy
head
crowns
the
top
i
can
smell
this
beer
with
out
even
holding
it
to
my
nose
not
suprisingly
it
smells
of
hazlenut
but
it
smells
oh
so
good
my
tongue
is
pleased
with
the
flavors
of
hazlenut
coffee
toffe
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
nice
sweet
malty
finish
that
stays
with
you
for
awhile
feels
very
crisp
fresh
thick
and
syrupy
in
the
mouth
hazlenut
is
so
drinkable
my
macro
swill
drinking
friends
crave
this
this
is
the
one
craft
beer
that
they
like
brewed
with
hazelnut
extract
this
deep
ruddy
ale
is
a
welcome
diversion
from
straightforward
malt¬ín¬íhops
beers
trivia
fact
oregon
grows
98
of
america¬ís
hazelnuts
a
uniquely
flavored
brown
ale
a
true
rogue
in
consistency
and
novelty
a
great
brew
a
great
beer
but
certainly
one
i
only
crave
once
or
twice
a
year
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
and
are
tired
of
boring
brown
ales
give
this
a
shot
notes
i
feel
like
a
broken
record
with
rogue
mouthfeel
is
off
the
charts
once
again
ive
yet
to
come
across
a
beer
that
wasnt
near
perfect
from
this
company
good
thing
that
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
is
in
a
different
category
or
they
would
have
a
run
for
their
money
the
two
best
browns
in
my
opinion
in
my
humble
opinion
when
compared
to
other
rogue
beers
this
one
is
a
miss
although
i
love
the
creativity
hazelnut
flavors
and
aromas
make
this
beer
palatable
its
just
that
it
could
be
so
much
better
taste
is
also
very
malty
more
toastyness
with
a
bare
hint
of
chocolate
sweet
but
not
overly
so
hazlenutty
obviously
but
i
also
got
a
vanilla
extract
thing
going
on
in
there
pretty
easy
to
drink
though
im
not
sure
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
interesting
a
nice
dessert
type
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
brown
ales
but
for
the
style
this
one
very
good
another
winner
from
rogue
overall
after
drinking
this
beer
so
far
ive
come
to
the
undeniable
conclusion
that
rogue
is
the
greatest
brewery
in
the
usa
this
beer
is
a
masterpiece
of
taste
and
i
greatly
recommend
everyone
go
out
and
buy
it
i
surely
drank
too
much
of
this
one
i
wouldnt
drink
it
all
night
but
splitting
a
bomber
for
a
dessert
would
work
fine
not
sure
about
matching
it
with
chocolate
22
oz
bottle
excellent
with
marzipan
poured
from
a
bomber
bottle
into
my
new
24
oz
mug
nice
pour
head
rises
quickly
up
to
a
couple
fingers
high
seems
smallish
in
comparison
to
being
poured
into
a
12
oz
mug
dark
brown
in
color
with
nice
deep
red
edging
in
the
light
a
very
nice
beer
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
faint
a
bit
nutty
but
not
what
i
had
expected
sweet
with
more
hop
presence
than
i
had
expected
this
one
tastes
very
good
sweet
and
creamy
up
front
with
a
lot
of
malt
the
nuttiness
shows
up
in
the
middle
toasty
a
nice
hop
balance
in
the
finish
with
a
little
more
of
that
creaminess
sneaking
in
very
nice
and
full
taste
the
creaminess
that
i
speak
of
billows
over
into
the
mouthfeel
if
not
a
little
on
the
watery
side
this
beer
is
quite
full
good
cabonation
gives
a
little
bit
of
bite
i
really
liked
this
one
probably
not
my
favorite
from
rogues
but
a
nice
drinker
none
the
less
try
it
you
will
like
it
rogue
is
super
consistent
and
you
can
add
this
to
their
list
of
impressive
beers
this
is
a
hell
of
a
dessert
brew
mdn
great
taste
beer
i
often
look
at
brown
ales
as
sort
of
a
novelty
not
sure
why
this
beer
is
a
reminder
of
how
good
they
can
be
review
was
a
bit
short
becasue
i
lost
the
first
review
in
transisition
smell
is
sweet
with
hazelnut
and
some
doughy
malt
taste
is
malt
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
hazelnut
very
sweet
but
not
excessively
so
mouthfeel
is
decenta
little
thicker
than
average
with
light
carbonation
since
i
like
sweetmalty
beers
i
could
drink
this
for
a
while
especially
with
a
little
something
to
munch
on
just
in
case
its
a
real
bummer
that
theres
no
head
retention
or
lacing
this
beer
taste
good
and
i
wish
it
looked
good
too
im
not
sure
its
a
bad
bottle
since
the
taste
is
good
so
im
confused
given
other
peoples
reviews
had
this
ontap
at
brewgrass
and
bought
another
bottle
today
this
is
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
had
the
first
thing
you
notice
when
you
have
a
drink
is
the
flavor
of
the
hazelnut
it
also
has
a
kinda
caramel
taste
to
it
it
is
a
deep
brown
color
with
minimal
head
i
thought
enough
of
this
beer
that
it
is
the
first
one
i
sampled
at
brewgrass
that
i
went
out
and
bought
rogue
brews
some
mighty
fine
beers
ill
certainly
buy
this
one
again
the
rogue
hazelnut
brown
had
very
dark
body
and
little
to
no
head
the
aroma
was
very
impressive
with
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
nutty
hints
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
very
smooth
and
it
had
a
wonderful
sweetness
characterized
by
chocolate
toffee
caramel
and
nuttiness
it
finished
excellently
with
a
sweet
smoothness
i
rarely
find
in
browns
i
highly
recommend
this
to
people
like
myself
who
are
constantly
unimpressed
with
browns
very
tasty
and
complex
this
one
im
not
a
nutbrown
fan
but
maybe
i
am
now
this
had
a
good
medium
body
and
could
possibly
pass
as
a
porter
subtley
complex
if
that
makes
sense
i
will
definitely
serve
this
on
the
holidays
and
keep
a
bottle
in
my
refrig
this
is
a
very
complex
yet
wellbalanced
american
take
on
the
brown
ale
i
wasn¬ít
sure
what
i
would
think
about
the
hazelnut
character
as
i¬ím
not
a
fan
of
hazelnut
coffees
but
it
complements
the
other
flavors
well
and
does
not
seem
out
of
place
here
serious
props
to
the
fellas
at
rogue
for
this
one
overall
excellent
american
brown
i
didnt
think
id
have
much
better
than
the
india
brown
by
dfh
the
other
night
but
i
think
i
have
aroma
is
better
here
and
taste
and
balance
is
the
slightest
little
bit
better
as
well
two
thumbs
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
small
with
head
that
recedes
within
seconds
the
aroma
huge
chocolate
nuts
more
chocolate
the
taste
is
chocolaty
too
with
roasted
flavors
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
overall
this
beer
seems
like
a
cross
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
porter
whatever
it
may
be
it
is
damn
good
drinkability
the
was
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
in
fact
i
stopped
by
a
local
shop
to
pick
up
several
of
the
20oz
bottles
on
my
way
home
a
5
30
price
per
bottle
is
a
bit
of
a
kickback
but
only
slightly
others
have
said
this
would
be
a
good
dessertbeer
and
i
agree
however
it
worked
well
in
a
chips
and
salsa
sitting
around
a
table
talking
format
as
well
was
a
good
pairing
with
the
queso
dip
actually
a
real
dark
reddish
brown
colorvery
nicebut
the
head
is
smallish
this
has
a
real
nuttyhazelnutand
chocolate
aroma
i
dont
have
a
great
nosebut
this
is
very
strong
this
tastes
great
a
real
strong
nuttycreamy
chocolate
flavor
this
is
delicious
this
has
a
lightmedium
feel
for
a
brown
alevery
drinkable
another
awesome
beer
from
rogue
pours
a
thick
dark
brown
color
with
a
dense
tancolored
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
a
soapy
density
i
smell
roasted
malts
along
with
toasted
bread
and
smokedburnt
nuts
the
taste
is
incredible
a
blast
of
coffee
nuts
brown
sugar
and
sweet
malts
rich
and
complex
and
yet
not
intimidating
the
finish
is
bittersweet
with
a
hint
of
semisweet
cocoa
an
excellent
beer
that
can
be
had
over
and
over
again
with
ease
after
dancing
around
this
beer
for
some
time
i
finally
got
arround
to
trying
it
smells
like
a
really
good
nut
brown
ale
lots
of
barley
malt
almonds
hazlenut
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
with
a
fermented
sour
to
the
nose
looks
almost
opaque
and
dark
brown
lightly
headed
with
a
tan
lace
tastes
like
a
big
flavored
brown
ale
with
ameretto
mixed
in
flavors
of
hazlenut
cocoa
barley
malt
and
caramel
remain
strong
into
the
finish
the
beer
wears
a
bit
grainy
and
astringent
but
not
to
deterring
levels
finishes
a
bit
thinner
than
the
initial
sip
could
be
a
bit
creamier
stillgood
beer
can
you
tell
that
its
one
of
my
favs
22
ounce
bottle
no
freshness
dating
the
only
reason
i
dont
give
the
drinkability
a
5
0
is
because
its
a
bit
sweet
as
a
desert
beer
should
be
but
really
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
beer
and
the
abv
isnt
so
high
to
make
that
a
problem
a
must
try
in
my
book
had
this
rogue
variation
on
tap
i
think
it
might
be
the
same
recipe
as
the
morimoto
but
it
definitely
has
a
different
flavor
profile
on
tap
i
like
the
bottle
version
but
this
stuff
is
really
good
on
tap
dark
brown
hazelnut
color
nice
creamy
tan
head
moderate
lacing
aroma
is
coffee
with
hazelnut
and
more
nuttyness
flavor
leans
on
the
sweet
side
with
caramel
and
toffee
malts
nutty
base
lots
of
roasted
hazelnut
flavor
in
here
creamy
a
bit
of
coffee
in
here
finish
is
somewhat
dry
but
lingers
mouthfeel
is
excellent
the
flavors
transition
and
work
with
each
other
quite
well
theres
a
nice
all
around
thickness
to
this
beer
better
on
tap
than
bottle
imo
taste
was
some
chococalte
hazelnut
caramel
with
a
sweet
malty
finish
color
me
crazy
but
this
reminds
me
somewhat
of
a
dopplebock
when
it
gets
a
litte
warmer
this
one
goes
down
very
smooth
with
only
a
touch
of
bitterness
the
aroma
got
my
attention
but
the
taste
which
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
keeps
me
contemplating
the
overtones
each
time
i
taste
this
deep
mahogany
brew
the
initial
frothy
head
didnt
stay
as
long
as
id
like
and
lacing
was
marginal
after
inital
pouring
of
the
brew
i
would
have
expected
this
beer
to
be
really
sweet
and
not
very
drinkable
however
there
is
a
nice
hop
balance
at
the
finish
not
too
heavy
in
alcohol
so
i
was
able
to
open
another
bomber
to
share
with
the
wife
as
the
evening
chill
set
in
tonight
a
very
interesting
offering
indeed
good
amount
of
hazelnut
flavor
and
more
detectable
in
the
after
taste
good
smooth
beer
that
is
great
for
a
after
dinner
drink
overall
a
very
nice
sweetened
brown
ale
to
drink
as
a
dessert
or
at
the
end
of
the
night
definitely
a
highly
drinkable
beer
worth
your
this
is
easily
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
the
taste
is
truly
delicious
malty
bitter
chocolate
goodness
with
hazelnut
undertones
that
are
most
easily
detected
after
the
postsip
exhale
the
rich
smooth
feel
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
very
good
beer
overall
a
solid
rogue
offering
and
a
great
after
dinner
beer
may
be
too
malty
sweet
for
consumption
anytime
but
after
dinner
makes
for
a
nice
desert
beer
though
and
i
enjoyed
the
infused
hazelnutin
taste
and
aroma
deep
brown
caramel
around
the
edges
good
very
fine
lacing
does
smell
faintly
of
hazelnut
more
like
chocolate
thoughkind
of
like
cake
icing
taste
is
too
malty
upfront
but
has
a
nice
roasted
nutty
finish
too
much
unbalanced
sweetness
not
as
good
as
i
had
remembered
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
where
this
one
lacks
in
nose
it
makes
up
for
in
flavor
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
drinkability
i
couldnt
finish
the
glass
didnt
want
to
finish
the
glass
and
my
wife
didnt
finish
hers
id
say
that
out
of
the
22
ounces
in
that
bomber
we
drank
maybe
8
combined
and
it
was
8
too
many
i
seriously
dont
know
how
people
can
drink
this
its
painful
taste
is
malty
no
real
noticable
hops
here
a
bit
bitter
on
the
finish
the
head
dissapears
fairly
quickly
with
minimal
lacing
a
medium
bodied
beer
but
very
tasty
the
taste
of
the
nuts
really
explodes
in
your
mouth
a
good
desert
beer
if
i
can
find
this
brew
again
i
will
buy
some
more
for
sure
thanks
jason
and
jenifer
an
interesting
beer
but
a
bit
too
much
in
the
hazelnut
category
for
me
i
might
sound
crazy
but
i
could
see
this
going
very
well
with
waffles
or
french
toast
very
sweet
and
fullflavored
yet
perhaps
a
bit
much
id
probably
have
to
switch
it
up
after
a
glass
or
two
still
you
have
to
respect
rogue
for
not
creating
your
typical
brown
ale
the
tastes
blend
together
amazingly
i
also
dont
think
the
beer
is
too
sweet
at
all
though
it
is
very
sweet
this
would
be
great
with
desserts
in
fact
great
as
a
dessert
this
beer
is
now
one
of
my
favorites
poured
a
crystalline
dark
brown
with
a
thick
frothy
head
that
held
laced
well
the
nose
smells
of
caramel
candy
perhaps
sweet
chocolate
the
nose
feels
weird
too
as
you
can
tell
its
fizzing
away
tons
of
malts
perhaps
a
bit
overly
matled
a
bit
roasty
pleasantly
smooth
though
the
carbonation
was
good
and
it
already
had
a
thick
feel
to
it
reminds
me
of
some
cold
coffee
concoction
you
might
get
a
big
bucks
pours
a
rich
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
smell
is
wonderfully
rice
and
full
of
hazelnuts
notes
of
caramel
and
chocolate
are
noticed
too
taste
is
great
every
bit
as
good
as
the
morimoto
was
maybe
a
bit
richer
almost
like
drinking
a
less
chocolate
laden
nutella
very
rich
and
a
bit
sweet
makes
a
wonderful
after
dinner
drink
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
drinkability
is
good
but
perhaps
a
bit
rich
for
every
day
consumption
might
even
go
well
with
a
roasted
pork
or
game
dish
if
it
featured
nuts
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
orange
tint
a
2
finger
head
and
very
good
lace
a
nice
rich
malty
smell
but
not
a
heavy
roasted
smelllike
a
porter
or
stout
maple
and
nut
aromas
are
abundant
a
slightly
roasted
malt
dominates
with
flavor
with
strong
maple
and
nut
flavors
a
slight
coffelike
bitterness
hits
in
the
aftertaste
slightly
buttery
with
medium
carbonation
and
good
drinkability
a
nice
session
beer
medium
brown
color
with
mild
orange
highlights
the
beer
was
topped
by
a
decent
tan
colored
head
that
receded
quickly
back
into
the
beer
the
nose
has
a
lot
of
caramel
malt
with
a
finish
of
toffee
the
taste
is
more
sweet
than
i
expected
over
the
top
on
caramel
it
comes
close
to
chocolate
there
is
a
little
fruit
on
the
finish
in
the
form
of
pears
and
apples
this
beer
is
well
rounded
why
can¬ít
all
brown
ales
be
like
this
smooth
very
rich
mouth
feel
extremely
high
drinakbility
wow
gas
n
go
if
there
is
a
better
brown
out
there
id
be
curious
to
try
it
that
being
said
this
is
a
good
brown
but
on
dimensional
and
cloying
i
wont
try
this
again
but
it
was
cool
to
try
forgetable
but
not
regreatable
and
edible
this
is
definitely
a
dessert
beer
albeit
a
good
one
definitely
worth
a
try
cheers
dn
nothing
special
here
ill
give
this
beer
another
go
in
a
few
months
the
wilhelm
smell
is
just
creeping
me
out
shame
to
say
but
the
rest
of
the
bottle
in
the
fridge
has
a
date
with
the
sink
appearance
is
a
deep
burnt
sienna
with
ruby
trim
beige
foam
and
lace
aroma
screams
malt
along
with
a
scent
of
mixed
nuts
and
plums
initial
taste
has
sweet
roasted
malt
hazelnuts
blending
into
leafy
hops
and
burnt
chocolate
there
is
an
understated
hint
of
dark
fruits
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
perfect
with
something
sweet
deep
opaque
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
faded
fast
lacing
slid
back
down
glass
into
the
brew
roasty
malt
smell
that
was
sort
of
singular
but
faint
roasted
hazlenut
taste
with
sweet
malt
and
some
chocolate
notes
very
rich
bitter
hops
tail
wrapped
around
sweetness
in
the
finish
smooth
yet
substantial
mouthfeel
wellbalanced
but
i
would
drink
it
more
as
a
treat
than
as
a
session
beer
would
be
good
paired
with
sweet
foods
i
bet
very
very
enjoyable
im
sorry
i
waited
so
long
to
give
this
one
a
try
this
is
my
favorite
rouge
offering
that
ive
had
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
picked
up
from
rileys
here
in
madison
one
bottle
left
so
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
looks
beautiful
out
of
the
bottle
a
deep
roasty
brown
with
a
big
tan
head
with
some
staying
power
smell
is
very
subtle
roasted
malt
with
some
nuttiness
taste
was
subtle
as
well
with
roasted
coffee
and
sweet
malt
flavors
with
a
nice
hazelnut
finish
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
velvety
definitely
a
good
session
beer
could
have
drank
it
all
night
was
a
little
more
subtle
than
i
was
expecting
but
overall
a
tasty
brew
a
great
dessert
beer
very
dark
brown
nearly
opaque
with
cherry
highlights
thick
foamy
tan
head
it
smells
of
wood
and
alcohol
with
a
vague
sweetness
upon
tasting
you
get
a
blast
of
sweetness
perhaps
dark
chocolate
then
theres
a
nutty
taste
which
is
quickly
drown
by
alcohol
taste
fades
into
a
grassy
finish
very
drinkable
in
taste
but
the
alcohol
content
was
too
much
for
me
to
drink
too
much
of
it
not
much
head
thats
yellowbrown
beer
is
dark
brown
nose
gives
hints
of
the
mentioned
hazelnut
but
is
mostly
sour
carramelicchoclate
some
hops
and
litle
roasty
taste
is
very
dry
and
sour
roasty
portlike
hazelnut
liquor
with
dry
andlightbitter
aftertaste
good
brew
but
mouthfeel
misses
fullness
body
of
malts
that
darkbeers
normally
have
easy
drinkable
nice
solid
beer
to
have
once
in
a
while
though
it
may
be
a
little
hard
to
pair
with
things
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
often
buy
at
my
local
for
some
reason
its
the
only
rogue
they
sell
pours
a
deep
amber
the
nose
is
very
fruity
this
beer
tells
me
to
relax
nice
and
malty
i
have
tis
beer
close
to
me
when
i
need
it
good
brew
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
hue
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
dissapates
quickly
aroma
is
hazelnut
milk
chocolate
and
toffee
very
appealing
nose
taste
is
very
malty
flavors
of
hazelnut
milk
chocolate
caramel
and
a
light
hint
of
hops
bitterness
finish
is
slightly
sweet
and
nutty
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
moderately
carbonated
a
huge
brown
ale
from
rogue
highly
drinkable
but
complex
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
with
some
nice
texas
barbecue
or
chocolate
cake
i¬ím
almost
ashamed
that
i
didn¬ít
have
any
of
either
on
hand
when
i
had
this
it
turned
out
to
be
rather
drinkable
though
i
didn¬ít
have
any
problem
getting
through
the
bomber
pours
a
porterlike
darkbrown
from
the
bottle
a
few
fingers
of
nice
tan
foam
and
relatively
good
head
retention
as
well
smells
quite
sweet
and
malty
with
nice
smoky
and
nutty
undertones
the
flavor
doesnt
really
live
up
to
the
aroma
unfortunately
starts
off
well
enough
malty
nutty
smoky
and
strangely
refreshing
as
the
beer
warms
however
it
develops
a
sticky
sweetness
that
begins
to
overpower
the
palate
the
hops
are
essentially
missinginaction
so
theres
not
much
here
to
balance
the
sugars
sticky
and
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
so
long
as
you
like
hazelnut
overall
a
great
beer
i
would
love
to
have
this
in
my
fridge
all
the
time
i¬íd
return
to
the
hazlenut
its
certainly
a
unique
brown
ale
pours
a
nice
reddishbrown
producing
a
nice
foamy
head
very
distinct
teriyaki
smell
and
taste
just
a
hint
of
hazelnut
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
no
bite
but
it
is
still
a
little
thin
for
my
tastes
good
spicyness
a
little
coffeeesque
like
most
brown
ales
and
stouts
ill
drink
this
again
sometime
it
might
be
better
if
its
a
little
colder
served
out
of
a
22
oz
bomber
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
thin
tan
head
smells
greathazelnet
toffee
caramel
and
honeyvery
sweet
smelling
taste
is
very
sweet
hazelnuts
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
very
creamy
and
smooth
the
sweetness
never
gets
too
cloying
so
i
think
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
interesting
beer
appears
a
nice
dark
brown
some
light
coming
through
with
a
substantial
head
smell
is
great
nice
and
nutty
hazlenutty
that
is
with
nice
creamy
chocoloate
and
coffee
accents
though
not
overwhelming
taste
is
much
the
same
this
is
almost
a
bit
too
tasty
for
a
beer
if
that
makes
sense
the
taste
is
of
course
great
dont
get
me
wrong
but
its
almost
like
im
drinking
a
cappucino
a
little
too
much
artificial
flavoring
if
you
ask
me
i
like
my
beer
a
little
more
beerish
with
more
emphasis
on
the
malts
and
hops
however
theres
a
great
smooth
mouthfeel
to
this
if
they
reduced
the
cappucino
flavor
a
bit
this
would
be
a
classic
beer
although
as
of
now
its
a
bit
wimpy
due
to
the
flavoring
taste
is
semi
sweet
malt
at
first
a
wave
of
bitter
nutty
hop
feel
comes
into
play
then
a
sweet
hazelnut
finish
there
is
smoothness
in
the
flavor
that
is
pleasant
to
the
taste
buds
not
too
sweet
or
bitter
and
very
flavorful
a
great
example
of
a
brown
ale
from
the
bottle
poured
a
mahagony
with
a
nice
tan
head
witch
some
nice
lacing
aromawhat
else
but
hazelnut
honey
brown
sugar
malts
a
nice
nuttyness
plums
and
raisins
flavor
unfortunately
they
were
weak
but
did
get
some
hazelnut
honey
and
just
a
touch
of
coffee
tastes
of
rich
caramel
malt
nutty
lots
of
hazelnut
almost
overwhelming
at
times
milk
chocolate
sweetness
velvet
smooth
but
just
a
touch
thin
take
the
hazelnut
out
and
its
a
top
notch
brown
ale
with
the
hazelnut
in
it
can
be
a
bit
too
much
and
offputting
not
bad
but
not
a
favorite
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
tan
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
dark
reddish
brown
brew
frothy
head
lasts
well
and
laces
well
aroma
is
creamy
malty
and
a
bit
nutty
taste
is
sweet
husky
brown
malts
with
a
hazelnut
finish
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
enjoyable
brew
this
beer
pours
an
auburn
dark
red
color
the
head
is
tan
and
fades
rather
quickly
like
the
name
would
suggest
it
smells
of
hazelnuts
it
also
has
a
slightly
malty
smell
there
are
faint
scents
of
cinnamon
it
tastes
very
sweet
the
hazelnut
flavor
is
apparent
it
has
a
lightly
toasted
maly
flavor
there
is
also
a
slight
chocolate
taste
to
it
this
beer
is
creamy
and
smooth
it
is
carbonated
just
right
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
it
is
a
very
good
beer
as
with
the
morimoto
hazelnut
signature
ale
this
beer
might
not
make
the
best
session
beer
due
to
the
very
sweet
flavor
if
you
can
find
this
beer
it
is
definately
worth
your
time
and
money
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
that
yielded
no
head
or
lacing
clear
dark
brown
in
color
hazelnut
and
some
dark
malt
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
nose
hazelnut
and
the
prickley
carbonation
were
the
first
two
things
i
noticed
in
the
first
sip
i
think
the
hazelnut
was
a
little
bit
overdone
because
it
was
in
the
forefront
with
the
maltiness
carbonation
and
hops
battling
to
show
up
relatively
moderate
in
body
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
overall
not
that
impressed
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
i
will
spend
another
5
00
for
another
bottle
body
is
a
ruby
red
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
some
clumps
of
lace
were
left
as
the
head
stayed
afloat
aroma
was
simple
but
appetizing
caramel
malt
and
a
fairly
strong
nuttiness
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
flavors
of
caramel
and
the
nuttiness
combine
for
the
majority
of
the
flavor
some
notes
of
toastiness
ends
on
a
bitter
nutty
note
a
bit
light
in
the
mouth
this
is
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
complements
the
taste
very
well
drinkability
is
good
with
the
only
knock
being
the
sweetness
would
be
a
bit
much
after
a
few
a
nice
tasty
and
easy
drinking
treat
smooth
and
creamy
medium
to
thick
bodied
with
fairly
big
carbonation
goes
down
nicely
and
rather
drinkable
sexy
good
stuff
nonetheless
what
a
ridiculously
drinkable
brew
pours
dark
dark
ruby
from
a
22oz
bomber
smell
is
unreal
hazelnuts
cinnamon
maybe
a
little
creme
brulee
taste
is
smooth
satisfying
creamy
definite
hazelnut
notes
with
some
subtle
spicing
and
a
slightly
chocolatey
creaminess
very
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
you
can
definitely
swirl
this
one
around
a
bit
to
get
all
the
relevant
flavors
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
brown
ale
and
dessert
beer
categories
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
again
drinkability
is
great
for
this
style
and
can
be
a
session
beer
for
some
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
color
with
a
few
brown
highlights
nice
head
and
head
retention
about
a
12
inch
head
that
settles
down
to
14
inch
when
you
swirl
it
in
your
glass
it
clings
to
the
glass
and
gently
falls
down
the
side
aroma
and
taste
go
well
together
with
some
nutty
flavor
and
aroma
as
expected
i
dont
like
hazelnut
coffee
but
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
good
but
not
exceptional
very
clean
and
balanced
toward
the
malts
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
rich
chocolate
color
with
a
great
tan
head
with
thick
lace
the
taste
was
sweet
at
first
with
a
huge
thunderclap
of
malts
that
followed
only
a
little
twist
of
hops
then
a
lingeing
sweet
and
oily
hazelnut
aftertaste
easily
one
of
the
most
creative
beers
ive
ever
had
that
was
actualy
drinkable
it
is
pretty
rich
though
almost
desertish
drinkability
highly
drinkable
not
cloying
the
hazelnut
extract
flavors
melds
nicely
with
the
natural
beer
flavors
i¬íd
definitely
have
another
if
there
was
one
around
very
drinkable
and
yet
another
good
beer
from
rogue
a
solid
beer
from
a
quality
brewery
all
in
all
a
very
tasty
brew
and
one
ill
certainly
be
seeking
out
again
my
biggest
fear
was
that
this
would
be
a
novelty
beer
oh
look
we
put
nuts
in
our
nut
brown
ale
but
those
fears
turned
out
to
be
unfounded
the
hazelnut
extract
was
a
good
compliment
to
the
brown
ale
and
was
in
appropriate
proportions
so
as
not
to
be
overwhelming
or
distracting
this
rates
as
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
tried
hands
down
pours
a
deep
brown
colour
with
a
creamy
brown
head
wonderful
aroma
of
hazelnut
toasted
notes
chocolate
and
grain
smells
like
hazelnut
chocolate
by
far
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
the
hazelnut
flavour
is
insane
shots
of
hazelnut
flavouring
rich
nutty
balanced
by
a
good
bitterness
wonderful
easy
drinking
brown
ale
enjoyed
by
all
of
my
friends
such
complexity
such
balance
this
beer
is
truly
one
of
the
kings
of
its
style
the
beer
pours
to
a
nutty
brown
color
imagine
that
with
a
slight
red
haze
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
could
have
been
better
but
it
was
enough
to
keep
my
beer
fresh
from
the
stale
air
without
being
too
much
the
smell
is
also
quite
bland
compared
to
the
explosion
of
sweet
caramelized
malty
goodness
paired
with
hints
of
hazelnut
chocolate
coffee
and
hops
bitterness
i
am
hard
pressed
to
think
of
a
tastier
brew
especially
after
having
polished
off
a
few
bombers
of
this
at
my
friends
house
just
a
moment
ago
i
would
recommend
this
to
anybody
regardless
of
their
preferred
style
drinkability
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
not
overly
sweet
or
strong
but
suited
for
drinking
with
sweets
it
paired
really
well
with
a
slice
of
chocolate
pecan
pie
this
beer
departs
the
bomber
a
rich
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
calls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
very
nutty
some
roasted
and
a
slight
chocolate
character
the
flavor
follows
suit
very
well
full
flavored
chocolate
covered
nuts
more
flavor
than
i
remember
in
any
brown
ales
ive
had
recently
the
feel
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
moderate
to
thick
on
the
feel
nice
nice
beer
thank
you
rogue
for
making
this
one
available
i
think
that
this
beer
could
easily
become
a
standard
for
every
season
not
too
thick
or
thin
dark
or
light
just
balanced
really
well
with
a
vey
nice
flavor
bravo
totally
refreshing
and
full
flavored
cant
think
of
many
things
that
i
would
like
to
relax
with
more
than
this
bring
on
the
next
one
one
of
my
favorites
from
rogue
and
definately
drinkable
now
to
only
find
it
on
tap
somewhere
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
rogue
series
surprised
its
not
a
seasonal
perfect
for
the
holiday
months
drinkability
better
than
average
brown
ale
imo
would
definitely
try
again
almost
like
a
stoutbrown
ale
mixture
another
screamer
from
rogue
overall
impression
i
enjoy
the
smell
a
bit
more
than
the
taste
the
nut
flavor
is
a
bit
artificial
tasting
but
not
horribly
so
i
think
i¬íd
like
the
unflavored
version
of
this
brown
ale
to
me
it¬ís
very
close
to
the
other
rogue
hazelnut
a
touch
sweet
for
a
session
and
the
bomber
is
probably
best
split
with
friends
as
a
dessert
definitely
a
good
session
beer
another
of
the
dark
rich
beers
had
during
the
daypours
a
deep
brown
with
some
amber
highlights
thr
out
a
nice
creamy
looking
head
that
leaves
a
light
amount
of
lacebig
rich
aromas
some
sweet
cream
and
vanilla
with
only
a
light
hazelnut
note
taste
up
is
of
dark
roast
coffee
going
into
a
light
mocha
flavor
with
that
hazelnut
flavor
coming
thry
late
and
even
more
as
it
warmed
a
rich
flavorful
brown
ale
somewhat
sweet
but
not
cloying
a
good
dessert
beer
i
would
think
on
tap
dark
brown
cloudy
liquid
with
a
very
thin
offwhite
head
small
amounts
of
lace
on
the

pac
man

is

definitely
more
toward
a

beer
mouthfeel
medium

slightly
stickey
at

even
carbonation
no
complaints
from
this
compadre
drinkability
damn
near
excellent
in
my
opinion
just
so
worth
the
price
five
bucks
for
a
bomber
im
loving
it
a
deep
brown
pour
with
a
huge
tan
head
semi
sweet
nose
a
little
nuttiness
and
some
chocolatey
notes
the
taste
was
of
dry
cocoa
light
chocolate
and
a
semibitter
and
hazelnut
finish
a
mostly
light
bodied
beer
with
a
smooth
creaminess
in
the
mouthfeel
the
finish
lingered
nice
and
long
and
had
a
good
combo
of
malty
hop
and
nut
a
very
good
brown
ale
very
good
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
wish
we
could
get
kegs
of
this
more
often
this
beer
is
a
pleasant
surprise
im
a
rogue
fan
but
i
wasnt
expecting
much
after
being
disappointed
by
morimoto
hazelnut
the
secret
i
believe
is
that
this
beer
is
first
and
foremost
a
quality
brown
ale
and
the
hazelnut
flavor
is
complimentary
in
the
best
possible
way
i
should
never
have
doubted
for
my
penance
ill
purchase
a
few
more
bombers
as
soon
as
possible
this
is
a
tasty
beer
for
after
dinner
while
not
nearly
as
filling
as
many
beers
i
would
call
dessert
beers
this
is
definitely
too
sweet
to
be
a
session
beer
chocolate
only
because
its
rich
and
thick
a
couple
of
these
bottles
would
probably
be
the
most
i
could
put
down
and
a
hops
character
to
balance
it
all
into
a
supremely
drinkable
brown
ale

but
they
were
way
overpowered
by
the
nuttiness
it
was
very
smooth
and
full
of
flavor
and
they
certainly
achieved
the
desired
result
of
hazlenut
but
it
was
too
simple
for
me
more
malt
and
less
hazlenut
might
have
made
this
a
more
balanced
beer
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
one
of
my
top
choices
this
is
alright
as
a
change
of
pace
but
the
bomber
was
too
much
for
me
it
just
got
too
sweet
and
fake
tasting
notes
a
full
flavoured
brown
ale
with
the
nice
addition
of
hazelnut
extract
this
is
my
kind
of
dessert
beer
give
me
a
square
of
tiramisu
or
molten
chocolate
cake
and
id
be
in
beer
heaven
the
nectar
pours
a
deep
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
unfortunately
the
head
fades
pretty
quickly
leaving
only
faint
traces
of
lace
on
the
glass
rich
aroma
of
hazelnut
with
coffee
and
chocolate
faint
spicy
hops
also
detectable
when
you
look
for
them
amazing
taste
rich
hazelnut
chocolate
caramel
malts
with
just
a
bit
of
hops
for
zest
rich
and
creamy
brew
yet
another
winner
from
rogue
ill
have
to
try
this
one
with
breakfast
some
time
eat
drink
and
be
merry
i
first
tried
this
on
tap
and
greatly
enjoyed
it
the
bottled
version
less
exciting
soda
poplike
effervescence
head
fizzed
then
fizzled
like
most
sodas
reminiscent
of
root
beer
or
cream
soda
especially
in
mouthfeel
some
nice
caramel
malt
flavors
accented
by
the
hazelnut
with
hints
of
coffee
cream
and
chocolate
but
in
all
honesty
thats
about
it
little
in
the
way
of
hops
which
is
good
for
this
brew
but
theres
just
not
a
lot
going
on
here
still
pretty
tasty
but
sadly
flat
in
my
glass
like
a
soda
that
sat
out
too
long
i
bet
you
could
use
this
beer
in
some
interesting
recipes
man
everything
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
the
brew
was
beautiful
with
a
deep
brown
colour
and
heavy
brownish
head
the
scent
was
of
sweet
caramel
and
a
shade
of
coffee
hazelnut
perhaps
a
rich
nutty
and
caramel
flavor
swirls
around
in
a
velvety
coat
the
only
drawback
is
that
its
richness
nut
flavors
and
nearlyheavy
body
make
it
one
to
savor
in
moderation
and
as
an
everyday
thirstquencher
regardless
another
great
brew
form
rogue
they
always
do
you
right
this
beer
poured
out
a
nice
very
dark
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
that
did
subside
with
some
lace
nice
faint
malt
smell
to
it
slight
hazelnut
smell
to
it
some
coffee
aroma
to
it
the
flavor
is
what
hits
you
because
of
the
hazelnut
you
would
have
to
put
this
not
only
as
a
brown
ale
but
a
spice
beer
the
hazelnut
taste
was
very
good
and
quite
pronounced
it
was
so
heavy
with
that
taste
you
wonder
if
that
adds
to
the
body
to
it
as
well
as
the
mouthfeel
good
flavor
but
the
strong
hazelnut
and
carmel
aspects
to
this
might
throw
some
worth
checking
out
this
dark
brown
ale
is
very
different
that
one
expects
from
rogue
in
a
couple
respects
rogue
makes
a
lot
of
great
brews
but
generally
they
are
hopped
to
high
heaven
this
beer
has
a
gentle
bitterness
and
distinct
caramel
nut
malty
flavor
which
is
introduced
strongly
by
the
aroma
nice
medium
body
and
sweet
aftertaste
great
desert
beer
for
everyone
yoohoo
flavored
beer
pours
a
thick
greenishbrown
head
deep
reddishbrown
color
chocolate
flavored
and
thick
milky
mouthfeel
from
the
crystal
and
chocolate
malts
hazelnut
flavor
comes
through
at
the
end
and
is
not
artificial
tasting
this
must
be
one
awesome
beer
on
tap
someday
i
will
get
out
to
portland
to
sample
this
from
the
source
pours
a
nice
brown
with
a
tan
head
and
a
nice
lace
sweet
chocolate
slight
hazelnut
coffee
caramel
malt
and
some
subtle
hops
dominate
the
nose
chocolate
and
caramel
roasted
malts
are
the
first
to
hit
the
tongue
some
nice
slighty
spicy
hops
are
just
enough
to
balance
the
finish
has
a
great
hazelnut
character
to
it
very
smooth
and
creamy
and
extremely
drinkable
yet
another
great
brew
from
rogue
they
just
cant
seem
to
make
any
bad
beers
this
is
an
excellent
beer
rich
coffeeish
flavors
with
the
nice
hazelnut
hints
make
it
one
of
the
best
dessert
beers
ive
ever
had
this
beer
also
has
less
hop
presence
than
the
typical
rogue
brew
but
i
dont
think
a
lot
of
hops
would
match
the
rest
of
the
flavor
in
this
beer
smooth
dark
amber
full
bodied
brew
malty
roasted
nose
sweet
malts
particularly
chocolate
comprise
the
backbone
nutty
with
a
good
dose
of
bittering
hops
riding
a
fine
line
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
porter
rogue
does
it
again
with
a
quality
beer
this
stuff
really
is
nectar
on
draught
its
even
better
with
a
more
pronounced
hazelnut
character
wow
the
deepbrown
color
with
its
smooth
tan
head
make
you
want
to
drink
this
beer
then
the
hazelnut
and
chocolate
aromas
hit
the
nose
and
only
the
strong
of
heart
can
resist
tasting
the
beer
is
truly
a
religous
experience
hazlenut
chocolate
coffee
brown
ale
paradise
the
only
negative
is
that
the
beer
body
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
otherwise
find
it
and
treat
yourself
to
one
of
the
very
best
buy
two
one
to
savour
the
other
to
quaff
quickly
as
your
senses
will
beg
it
one
of
the
best
uses
of
flavor
ever
brewed
a
staple
of
mine
in
college
yeah
i
went
to
school
what
of
it
but
serious
now
what
a
nice
beer
i
think
i
once
drank
four
22s
if
i
didnt
i
wanted
to
er
should
have
harder
to
find
down
here
in
socal
but
i
found
two
places
that
sell
it
menaing
im
twice
asa
lucky
as
you
a
surprisingly
delicious
brew
that
you
and
everyone
you
know
will
love
go
get
it
o
a
well
done
brown
ale
clear
brown
color
lots
of
malt
smell
great
malt
taste
earthy
kind
of
nutty
right
amount
of
hops
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
o
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
of
all
time
i
love
this
beer
poured
into
a
voodoo
bell
tulip
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
retained
as
a
thick
collar
and
laced
the
glass
aroma
of
chocolate
malts
and
caramel
some
dark
fruit
notes
going
on
as
well
this
beer
can
be
a
bit
inconsistent
ive
found
this
particular
bottle
i
think
may
have
been
off
there
was
the
typical
characteristics
of
a
brown
ale
here
dark
malts
somewhat
roasty
caramel
sweetness
but
also
an
underlying
fruity
taste
that
was
sort
of
in
the
acetaldehyde
cidery
range
not
really
sure
what
was
going
on
here
and
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
this
beer
so
i
cant
really
compare
it
to
past
tastings
medium
body
pretty
smooth
but
again
a
bit
messy
off
inconsistent
worth
a
try
but
definitely
not
one
of
voodoos
best
o
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
brew
that
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
a
brown
which
combines
a
creamy
body
with
some
good
flavors
without
being
overly
robust
surprizingly
good
with
desent
flavor
the
taste
is
very
good
with
malty
toasted
taste
with
sufficiently
toffeelike
and
caramel
sweetness
with
light
coffeecocoa
and
hint
of
dried
fruit
in
the
light
woody
realm
with
mild
roast
in
the
finish
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
brown
plenty
of
malt
and
a
nice
amount
of
alcohol
very
easy
to
quaff
d
a
good
drinking
strong
brown
ale
goodgreat
aroma
good
flavor
the
astringency
is
almost
too
strong
as
i
wouldnt
hate
for
a
little
softer
malt
profile
to
keep
things
biscuit
and
a
bit
rounder
not
bad
nontheless
pours
a
darker
brown
with
a
full
head
that
disappates
to
mostly
a
rim
around
the
glass
clean
filtered
aroma
is
darker
malts
brown
sugar
and
maple
syrup
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
good
quality
brew
good
balance
not
too
thick
for
the
beginning
of
spring
but
not
too
thin
to
give
some
heartiness
to
it
good
flavor
and
drinkability
nice
balance
in
the
coffee
and
hop
elements
would
definitely
have
again
more
good
stuff
from
voodoo
go
get
it
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
one
to
try
if
the
chance
arises
as
it
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
and
just
the
right
amount
of
booziness
to
give
it
a
nice
warming
feel
but
yet
maintain
great
drinkability
o
this
quickly
became
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
this
isnt
a
style
i
typically
enjoy
but
this
beer
really
impresses
me
in
all
factors
i
wish
voodoo
had
wider
distribution
this
should
be
coveted
by
all
this
is
certainly
a
superior
brown
ale
that
should
give
other
brewers
something
to
shoot
for
the
nuttiness
with
just
enough
richness
and
a
good
dose
of
hops
is
totally
drinkable
from
food
and
friends
in
philadelphia
in
the
12
oz
bottle
pappy
says
so
o
a
great
brown
ale
one
i
would
definitely
drink
again
and
a
again
pours
a
dark
brown
medium
sized
dense
persistent
offwhite
head
mild
malty
smell
a
little
chocolate
and
some
sweetness
in
the
nose
taste
is
mostly
toasted
malt
some
chocolate
notes
again
fairly
low
sweetness
just
a
little
herbal
hop
flavor
some
bitterness
throughout
from
the
hops
and
maybe
some
roasted
malt
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
but
not
too
heavy
extremely
drinkable
pretty
good
stuff
overall
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brown
ale
that
would
make
a
good
accompaniment
to
food
particularly
a
burger
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
good
representation
of
the
style
would
pair
very
nicely
with
a
beef
stew
and
some
sharp
cheddar
cheese
overall
i
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
and
so
happy
i
did
you
cant
find
these
in
boston
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
palo
santo
marron
but
about
2
steps
down
which
to
me
is
a
good
thing
i
love
palo
santo
but
if
i
saw
this
stuff
around
i
would
probably
pick
it
over
it
really
a
great
offering
and
my
first
voodoo
beer
good
job
guys
will
be
looking
for
more
in
the
future
22
ounce
bottle
into
snifter
no
bottle
date
i
got
a
gusher
pours
crystal
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
dense
23
fingers
of
light
tan
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
fairly
thick
lacing
cap
that
lasts
forever
some
nice
lacing
clings
around
the
glass
as
well
aromas
of
roasted
malt
caramel
bread
apple
skin
light
dark
fruit
chocolate
and
some
molasses
i
think
it
is
safe
to
say
my
bottle
might
be
a
bit
infected
the
apple
skin
aroma
just
throws
everything
off
taste
quite
a
bit
better
big
caramel
toasted
malt
biscuit
chocolate
bitter
coffee
molasses
nuttiness
and
spiciness
fair
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
caramel
chocolate
molasses
bread
nuttiness
and
spices
nice
balance
of
flavor
and
bitterness
a
bit
of
a
metallic
flavor
is
present
as
well
medium
bodied
with
big
full
carbonation
with
a
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
with
big
prickly
carbonation
overall
for
probably
being
infected
this
is
an
ok
brown
ale
i
will
definitely
give
it
another
shot
sometime
the
bomber
is
only
6
bucks
m
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
o
this
is
a
wellcrafted
brown
ale
that
pulls
you
in
and
makes
you
want
more
i
find
it
to
be
very
well
balanced
and
flavorful
if
you
like
a
americanstyle
brown
ale
this
one
is
for
you
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
othis
one
left
me
a
bit
flat
i
was
expecting
more
in
the
taste
department
pretty
lackluster
brew
that
will
not
find
a
space
in
my
cellar
o
maybe
a
little
bit
too
roasty
for
me
but
not
too
shabby
o
a
great
example
of
a
style
that
is
often
mailed
in
this
isnt
your
daddys
brown
ale
this
is
a
complex
enjoyable
wellcrafted
brew
that
will
hang
in
there
with
a
porter
or
ipa
any
day
great
job
overall
a
fantastic
brown
ale
end
of
story
o
a
most
enjoyable
brown
ale
o
a
little
too
much
bitterness
and
coffee
flavor
for
my
taste
i
prefer
more
nutty
brown
ales
but
overall
this
wasnt
bad
the
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
wow
im
guessing
a
bad
bottle
based
on
the
other
reviews
first
things
first
pours
deep
brown
with
a
head
that
explodes
smell
is
all
bitter
coffee
and
metallic
not
good
and
the
taste
follows
very
bitter
and
ends
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
totally
over
carbonated
and
just
not
good
cant
really
pull
a
whole
lot
of
positive
out
of
this
one
but
im
guessing
it
is
just
a
bad
bottle
maybe
i
will
try
again
and
hope
for
a
better
bottle
a
solid
brown
ale
coffee
flavors
and
brown
malt
are
the
the
highlights
here
bigger
and
better
than
your
average
brown
if
your
ever
have
the
chance
to
try
this
i
definatly
suggest
you
do
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
coffee
going
on
in
it
the
beer
is
a
deep
brown
color
as
it
should
be
the
beer
didnt
have
much
of
a
nut
flavor
to
it
because
the
coffee
strongly
over
powers
it
the
sweetness
that
a
brown
ale
has
is
also
muted
for
the
same
reason
this
beer
is
now
on
the
bitter
side
like
cold
black
coffee
o
certainly
the
maltiest
and
also
most
bitter
brown
that
ive
ever
had
lots
of
characteristics
that
remind
me
of
stouts
and
strong
dark
ales
a
very
tasty
brew
pours
an
amber
brown
with
yeast
floating
around
very
little
head
or
carbonation
muted
aroma
of
coffee
and
cola
the
taste
is
of
caramel
and
malt
there
is
almost
no
bitterness
or
after
taste
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
have
it
again
i
look
forward
to
tasting
other
offerings
from
voodoo
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
weird
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
decent
amount
of
it
its
just
really
different
voodoo
has
crafted
a
historic
ale
at
a
weight
for
contemporary
palates
it
lumps
all
the
habitual
hoppiness
and
monster
maltiness
now
so
in
vogue
and
rallies
it
into
the
framework
of
an
old
timey
classic
and
in
doing
so
without
compromising
the
styles
traditionally
agreeable
quaffable
nature
it
serves
as
a
resounding
example
of
the
craftsmanship
and
intuition
of
this
brewery
and
the
american
craft
scene
in
general
d
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
a
bad
bottle
or
not
as
i
have
not
seen
anything
posted
anywhere
voodoo
makes
very
tasty
brews
this
one
is
a
miss
for
me
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
higher
than
expected
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
a
bit
prickly
on
the
tongue
i
could
not
finish
the
glass
and
dont
think
i
would
risk
trying
another
one
if
i
had
to
pay
for
it
this
just
doesnt
taste
much
at
all
like
the
wynonas
big
brown
i
had
before
that
inspired
me
to
recently
pick
up
this
bottle
to
review
the
sample
i
had
before
had
much
more
residual
sweetness
and
a
much
brighter
hop
character
to
it
perhaps
this
is
just
an
old
bottle
who
knows
there
is
no
way
to
tell
how
fresh
it
is
since
there
is
no
date
code
however
the
excess
carbonation
and
off
character
to
this
brew
makes
me
suspect
something
might
be
off
with
this
bottle
i
dont
know
if
it
provides
any
benefit
since
there
is
no
bottledate
code
but
this
particular
bottle
had
a
gold
cap
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
set
this
beer
apart
the
flavors
are
very
well
presented
but
come
clean
in
the
mouth
nothing
off
balance
good
carbontation
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
tough
to
tell
it
clocks
in
at
7
abv
i
have
only
had
two
voodoo
beers
so
far
and
they
were
both
pretty
solid
hopefully
i
will
get
my
hands
on
a
big
black
voodoo
daddy
that
is
if
the
bar
still
has
it
on
the
menu
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
really
is
a
superb
example
of
a
brown
ale
for
an
extremely
reasonable
price
packed
with
numerous
flavors
and
tastes
it
is
one
to
be
enjoyed
during
a
nice
chilly
day
or
even
a
warmer
one
because
it
is
so
dynamic
because
it
is
so
delicious
i
could
pound
this
but
it
shouldnt
be
just
because
it
so
amazing
voodoo
is
a
great
brewery
that
i
have
yet
to
have
a
bad
offering
from
wynonas
big
brown
ale
is
a
bold
brown
ale
that
is
rich
and
full
flavored
thumbsup
voodoo
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
more
than
adequate
carbonation
too
much
carbonation
sparkles
like
champagne
thats
the
big
bummer
here
if
the
carb
was
dialed
down
and
the
sparkle
subsided
wed
be
looking
at
one
of
my
favorite
new
brown
ales
as
is
id
give
another
vintage
a
shot
the
next
time
im
out
in
pa
another
pretty
impressive
tasting
beer
from
voodoo
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
however
due
to
carbonation
level
may
lead
to
a
full
gassy
feeling
that
would
not
lend
itself
to
being
sessionable
if
not
for
that
this
would
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
a
nice
big
brown
ale
that
could
be
a
staple
for
me
excellent
beer
overall
it
is
a
decent
brown
a
bit
roasted
but
i
like
the
chocolate
and
cocoa
decent
drinkability
fairly
solid
brown
in
general
cheers
i
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
has
a
deep
brown
pour
with
wayway
too
much
head
the
head
does
sticks
around
for
a
while
the
nose
is
full
of
sweet
roasted
malt
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
roasted
malt
really
shines
the
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
and
is
very
drinkable
a
very
good
brown
ale
imo
it
drinks
more
like
an
irish
stout
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
dark
brown
with
a
one
inch
head
i
had
a
ton
of
flakes
floating
in
the
beer
but
didnt
stop
me
from
drinking
smelled
just
like
brown
ale
should
roast
malts
with
chocolate
and
toffee
hints
it
was
not
overly
carbonated
and
did
not
feel
too
thin
like
some
brown
ales
i
have
had
in
the
past
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
night
a
good
beer
one
that
will
be
on
my
drink
when
possible
list
d
well
not
the
best
brown
ale
i
ever
had
but
still
highly
drinkable
pretty
nice
brown
ale
overall
this
brew
was
very
disappointing
due
to
what
i
obviously
already
pointed
out
i
will
have
to
revisit
a
fresh
2010
bottle
of
this
brew
but
for
now
i
am
very
underwhelmed
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
bit
of
warmth
going
down
but
pretty
drinkable
drinkability
is
great
nice
balance
big
and
tasty
a
nice
brown
ale
very
tasty
beer
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
looks
black
until
held
up
to
the
light
there
is
a
thin
mocha
head
that
is
gone
in
a
flash
the
smell
is
mostly
roasted
malts
with
chocolate
and
a
little
bitterness
from
something
maybe
some
hops
the
taste
is
more
roasted
malts
with
chocolate
and
coffee
a
little
sweet
with
little
to
know
hops
present
this
tastes
like
an
american
stout
but
the
mouthfeel
and
body
are
a
little
thin
which
bring
it
back
within
the
brown
ale
style
drinkability
is
low
for
a
brown
ale
but
still
rather
tasty
pour
into
victory
pint
glass
dark
brown
almost
black
color
american
hops
burnt
choclate
nose
followed
by
thin
body
you
can
really
taste
the
american
hops
and
burnt
chochlate
slight
etoh
overall
solid
brown
ale
would
drink
again
proably
my
second
favorite
hoppy
brown
but
prefer
brooklyn
brown
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
maple
syrup
and
chocolate
with
a
roasted
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
of
a
sweet
malt
and
roasted
malt
backbone
in
the
middle
there
is
a
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
with
a
small
hop
bite
the
hops
seem
to
be
earthy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
smooth
with
almost
no
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
slightly
above
average
the
hop
bite
in
the
middle
ditracted
from
the
nice
malty
notes
you
would
go
back
for
a
second
or
third
but
i
cant
see
you
drinking
a
six
pack
of
these
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
the
drinkability
could
be
better
if
it
wasnt
so
overly
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
again
d
drinkability
is
high
in
this
one
really
smooth
easy
to
drink
brown
ale
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
a
good
offering
from
a
great
brewery
d
i
automatically
compare
big
browns
to
dfhs
indian
brown
this
is
very
good
but
it
doesnt
quite
measure
up
never
again
wow
and
to
think
this
brewery
is
only
30
min
from
my
house
this
is
a
class
brewery
and
this
is
a
big
american
brown
ale
malty
hint
of
creamy
chocolate
and
nutty
med
body
and
a
nice
finish
maybe
a
splash
of
hop
on
that
finish
the
rest
of
the
beer
from
this
brewery
is
also
pretty
good
but
those
i
had
on
tap
wynonas
was
from
a
bottle
upick6
in
erie
pa
has
these
regularly
on
tap
and
in
bottles
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
thinner
khaki
colored
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
dominated
by
delicious
dark
roasted
malts
slight
earthy
nutty
and
smokey
notes
some
faint
carmel
sweetness
is
in
the
back
end
smells
bolder
than
you
average
brown
ale
bordering
on
porter
territory
taste
follows
the
scent
once
again
bolder
and
more
assertive
than
a
typical
brown
ale
but
not
as
aggressive
as
the
smell
dictates
dark
roasted
malts
roasted
nuts
earthy
slight
hints
of
carmley
sweetness
abvs
hidden
well
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
another
very
good
brew
from
voodoo
almost
infringes
on
english
porter
territory
with
its
bolder
brown
ale
profile
d
an
excellent
brown
ale
im
a
sucker
for
beers
named
after
the
songs
of
my
youth
this
may
be
the
only
one
and
i
wasnt
dissappointed
a
wonderful
introduction
to
voodoo
brewing
if
the
rest
of
their
creations
are
this
good
i
cant
wait
to
try
them
dsolid
rich
and
full
flavoured
i
loved
matts
big
brown
beaver
and
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
d
matts
got
himself
a
big
brown
ale
and
he
shows
it
off
to
all
of
his
friends
pours
a
great
deep
brown
with
fantastic
head
and
nice
lacing
excellent
deep
scent
very
dark
and
malty
a
wonderful
entdraught
with
fantastic
deep
malt
flavors
earthy
and
dark
with
a
slight
hint
of
nuttiness
goes
down
thick
and
great
with
no
hint
of
its
high
for
a
brown
ale
abv
fantastic
thank
god
for
the
big
pour
on
tap
in
the
burgh
i
didnt
even
know
they
kegged
their
beers
but
bocktown
is
pouring
wynonas
big
brown
ale
and
pilzilla
right
now
this
one
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
hue
with
some
ruby
highlights
peaking
through
dark
cola
like
head
reflects
well
through
the
somewhat
dimmed
lights
of
bocktown
aroma
has
the
dark
semi
sweet
cocoa
and
coffee
blend
with
a
nut
bread
edge
to
it
herbal
hops
reach
out
and
grab
your
senses
as
well
a
touch
of
anise
black
licorice
grabs
ahold
as
well
flavor
carries
it
out
nicely
with
complex
black
roasted
malts
and
chewy
brown
ale
notes
mild
coffee
with
herabl
rolling
hops
and
again
more
of
the
black
licorice
kick
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
tight
even
carbnoation
this
is
much
better
than
the
carbonation
issues
theyve
had
in
some
of
their
bottled
offerings
drinkability
is
all
around
excellent
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
tasted
in
the
past
few
years
of
getting
deeper
into
beer
d
really
great
big
brown
beer
i
feel
like
it
could
use
a
touch
more
sweetness
to
fully
achieve
greatness
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
wynonas
big
brown
ale
is
a
pretty
good
novel
brown
ale
it
could
use
a
couple
of
tweaks
i
dont
say
this
often
but
i
think
less
hops
might
really
improve
it
that
aspect
of
it
just
doesnt
gel
extremely
well
with
its
malty
base
and
seems
to
mask
some
of
its
other
flavors
too
much
carbonation
could
also
use
a
tweak
its
excessive
as
it
is
all
in
all
i
like
the
concept
and
the
overall
result
is
a
success
the
execution
isnt
perfect
but
it
does
the
job
as
a
side
note
any
primus
fan
will
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
i
am
on
both
counts
thanks
josh
on
tap
at
capones
this
one
just
did
not
do
it
for
me
the
color
was
a
dark
off
brown
that
was
somewhat
clear
with
a
good
tan
head
light
lacing
with
a
burnt
roasted
malt
smell
there
is
a
nice
hop
aroma
but
i
could
not
get
the
burned
malt
out
of
my
nose
surprisingly
i
tasted
coffee
hints
this
beer
seemed
tilted
unbalanced
the
hops
and
malt
did
not
blend
well
in
the
mouth
it
seemed
to
bubbly
for
this
style
otherwise
it
was
ok
i
had
a
4
oz
sample
and
that
was
enough
for
me
i
wish
i
dug
this
beer
as
much
as
i
dig
primus
later
recommended
i
love
me
some
voodoo
brewing
ontap
at
the
farmhouse
in
emmaus
pa
oh
man
this
is
a
brown
ale
for
brown
ale
lover
big
rich
and
just
drinkable
enough
to
get
you
in
trouble
were
talking
milk
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
also
with
a
balance
of
bread
roast
that
reminded
my
of
dark
toast
and
crust
surprisingly
smooth
really
watch
out
for
this
beer
so
i
reduced
the
beer
to
about
13
its
original
volume
on
high
heatwatch
out
for
boil
overs
added
fresh
black
pepper
and
buckwheat
honey
little
dijon
and
fresh
tarragon
marinated
for
at
least
4
hours
31
veal
breastpork
butt
cut
up
small
then
ground
it
mixed
in
carmelized
onions
and
apples
and
adjusted
seasoning
to
taste
my
secret
recipe
ill
only
share
here
cheers
wynona
is
brown
and
dark
and
has
a
thick
like
look
to
it
a
nice
dark
tan
colored
cap
sat
on
top
of
the
liquid
for
a
while
as
it
warmed
up
minimal
lace
once
again
off
the
tap
smells
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
candy
and
a
dose
of
hops
which
are
not
drowned
out
by
the
darker
scents
taste
like
a
big
bold
brown
with
a
good
amount
of
flavoring
hops
getting
some
nuts
and
grain
as
well
plus
some
chocolate
and
even
less
coffee
from
the
roasted
malt
bill
the
body
is
even
bolder
than
i
expected
for
a
typical
brown
ale
so
there
is
no
problems
there
i
had
a
small
sample
of
this
and
i
could
of
went
for
more
easy
delicious
off
the
tap
notes
one
heck
of
a
big
brown
ale
looking
forward
to
my
remaining
two
voodoo
beers
and
then
to
seek
out
the
two
that
i
do
not
have
big
black
voodoo
daddy
and
black
magick
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wonderful
caramel
and
roasted
malt
scent
as
well
as
some
hop
aroma
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
decent
i
like
the
concept
here
a
big
malty
beer
with
a
shit
ton
of
hops
to
boot
but
its
a
bit
scattered
and
unbalanced
its
a
very
bitter
brown
with
excellent
malt
character
i
almost
wish
it
wasnt
so
hoppy
anyway
its
bold
and
in
your
face
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
too
much
co2
i
cant
say
les
claypool
and
the
boys
wouldnt
like
this
beer
but
its
like
their
music
some
love
it
but
most
cant
stand
it
im
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
course
i
had
to
blip
big
brown
beaver
by
primus
wynonas
pretty
drinkable
i
like
this
one
a
solid
beer
trade
via
jwc215
good
complex
beer
drinkability
as
you
can
tell
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
like
dry
roasted
ales
and
this
one
was
all
about
the
roasted
flavors
sometimes
this
beer
did
get
a
little
too
nutty
if
you
like
your
brown
ales
heavy
on
the
roasted
nuts
and
slightly
sour
from
all
the
roasted
flavors
then
youll
definitely
like
this
beer
hell
this
beer
was
worth
the
money
just
by
writing
that
the
label
shows
a
woman
riding
a
big
brown
beaver
youll
get
chuckles
when
you
tell
people
that
had
again
in
2010
fest
and
it
was
a
lot
better
an
attack
of
hops
and
then
sweetness
overwhelms
very
good
to
drink
so
far
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
its
easy
to
make
a
malty
beer
but
this
is
an
example
of
a
well
crafted
deftly
blended
maltbomb
with
a
distinct
complexity
the
hops
bring
in
just
enough
to
let
you
know
that
balance
isnt
utterly
abandoned
just
biased
its
rocking
a
beat
of
alcohol
but
it
still
goes
down
smooth
and
clean
finding
this
in
front
of
me
will
always
bring
a
knowing
grin
to
my
face
hv
drinkability
nice
flavorful
beer
that
several
pints
can
be
consumed
in
a
session
i
enjoyed
two
bombers
in
one
evening
with
interest
level
high
at
the
start
and
the
end
a
big
thumbs
up
to
this
big
brown
ale
super
high
carbonation
off
the
pour
there
was
a
31
ratio
of
foam
to
beer
initially
the
beer
was
quite
dark
with
a
mahogany
hue
and
the
overly
generous
cap
was
fluffy
and
tan
clumpy
sticky
lacing
with
great
head
retention
lots
of
maltiness
in
the
aroma
caramel
with
a
little
bit
of
dark
grains
mild
chocolate
more
burnt
than
roast
with
just
a
hint
of
smoke
hops
stayed
in
the
background
but
were
definitely
present
solid
bitterness
both
from
hops
and
a
little
from
the
dark
grain
malty
without
being
overly
sweet
but
with
plenty
of
caramel
and
toffee
throughout
sour
cherry
became
a
bit
overpowering
towards
the
end
as
it
warmed
some
bitter
chocolate
seemed
a
little
unfocused
with
the
flavours
not
completely
in
sync
lingering
cherry
and
burnt
malt
light
smoke
carbonation
was
way
too
high
slight
dry
astringency
from
the
dark
grains
the
body
felt
lighter
than
it
should
due
to
the
carbonation
certainly
an
odd
beer
although
the
aroma
was
very
promising
the
flavour
didnt
hold
together
that
well
and
the
overcarbonation
was
a
problem
for
the
overall
texture
and
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
that
is
on
the
roastier
darker
side
of
the
style
spectrum
with
a
nice
nutty
character
mixing
in
and
a
nice
amount
of
balance
had
the
second
half
with
some
roast
beef
worked
nicely
with
the
charred
edges
and
mediumrare
juiciness
of
the
meat
pours
a
very
nice
dark
brown
color
very
nice
carbonation
very
nice
thick
creamy
onefinger
tannish
head
which
leaves
some
nice

the
taste
is
malty
slightly
bitter
roasty
with
nice
notes
of
toffeecaramel
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
thanks
joe
d
pretty
good
a
nice
dark
roasted
brown
that
packs
a
big
but
smooth
dark
roasted
bitterness
worthy
i
am
a
sucker
for
a
big
flavorful
brown
ale
and
this
one
does
the
trick
big
time
drinkabilitynotes
this
beer
needs
some
qa
done
at
the
brewery
way
overcarbonated
the
carbonation
really
does
the
beer
a
disservice
because
i
think
there
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
somewhere
in
my
glass
it
has
some
nice
qualities
chocalte
roasted
dark
malt
citrusy
hops
but
the
carbonation
issue
almost
ruins
it
you
really
need
to
let
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
as
well
to
really
get
a
good
feel
for
it
worth
a
try
i
dont
know
would
like
to
try
it
again
if
voodoo
gets
a
handle
on
carbonation
drinkability
if
it
werent
for
the
overcarbonation
this
would
be
a
fine
drinker
we
got
a
gusher
here
pours
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
hue
and
a
massive
tan
head
nose
is
muted
flavor
is
very
hearty
lots
of
malty
goodness
and
some
roasted
aspects
in
there
as
well
feel
is
nice
drinkable
yes
the
overcarbonation
definitely
is
a
killjoy
as
it
takes
a
long
time
to
get
this
thing
to
settle
where
you
can
take
a
sip
of
it
nice
and
robust
though
murky
dark
almost
black
brown
appearance
huge
head
that
forces
you
to
pour
this
one
over
5
minutes
or
so
once
its
in
the
glass
the
head
sustains
nicely
and
forms
crater
like
mounds
and
lumps
smell
of
faint
chocolate
and
somehow
a
chalky
note
mild
citrus
hop
notes
but
very
faint
taste
is
what
it
is
malty
little
bit
of
chocolate
chalky
off
taste
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
that
may
be
caused
by
the
huge
carbonation
level
and
the
airy
feel
that
gives
i
see
potential
in
these
beers
but
they
arent
quite
there
yet
yeah
this
one
tastes
a
heck
of
a
lot
like
the
pilzilla
golly
must
be
the
yeast
or
some
other
funkiness
in
the
brewery
only
the
pilzilla
is
a
lager
isnt
it
whatever
let
me
try
another
one
or
two
from
the
brewery
before
deciding
if
they
all
have
that
same
flavor
to
them
still
pretty
unbalanced
fizzy
way
too
much
chocolate
like
its
like
well
its
like
homebrew
the
first
time
brewing
a
recipe
before
you
tweak
it
that
chocolate
would
surely
mellow
with
age
but
im
not
keeping
this
one
around
long
enough
for
anything
like
that
to
happen
drinkability
extremely
enjoyable
i
recommend
everyone
give
it
a
try
some
will
moan
about
the
cost
but
given
how
big
this
beer
is
i
felt
it
was
well
worth
it
additionally
drinking
the
beer
slowly
allows
the
beer
to
warm
which
only
improves
the
ability
to
enjoy
its
complexity
4
5
overall
aside
from
some
serious
over
carbonation
this
was
a
definite
sipper
another
good
beer
from
voodoo
bottom
line
not
sure
if
i
just
got
an
overly
carbonated
bottle
or
if
all
are
like
this
but
after
allowing
to
sit
it
was
a
very
tasty
brew
d
pretty
good
definitely
a
big
brown
ale
though
when
voodoo
by
rusted
root
came
on
sirius
i
knew
it
was
time
to
get
down
with
the
brown
glad
i
did
d
a
nice
brown
ale
with
an
assertive
roasty
character
nice
drinkability
i
dont
know
what
the
abv
is
on
this
but
it
doesnt
drink
like
a
beer
over
6
i
really
like
this
beercould
drink
all
night
if
available
this
one
was
just
average
for
me
if
it
were
local
i
would
not
be
picking
this
up
as
a
6er
selection
awesome
brown
ale
definitely
the
smoothest
brown
i
have
ever
tasted
overall
i
generally
find
brown
ales
pretty
boring
but
the
flavors
here
caught
my
attention
thats
about
as
good
as
it
gets
with
this
style
this
is
a
refreshing
medium
body
medium
to
medium
low
carbonation
session
beer
nutty
earthy
taste
maybe
some
caramel
in
there
too
dark
brown
color
creamy
white
head
ok
beer
one
of
my
least
favorites
from
ale
asylum
i
have
fond
memories
of
madison
that
doesnt
have
any
bearing
here
im
just
sayin
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
surprisingly
swampy
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightlysandy
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
lightlytoasted
wheat
bread
honey
oats
a
sprinkle
of
dirt
and
a
vague
notion
of
even
vaguer
fruits
wafting
in
the
breeze
somehow
as
though
they
were
spirits
of
their
former
earthly
selves
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
that
odd
fruit
sensation
remaining
but
even
more
ephemeral
like
the
memory
of
the
above
description
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
decent
little
brown
ale
nothing
to
write
home
about
and
unfortunately
with
things
like
moose
drool
and
sam
smith
out
there
probably
nothing
im
likely
to
see
again
though
i
wouldnt
shun
it
if
handed
to
me
somewhere
overall
decent
overly
sweet
brown
ale
that
doesnt
bring
a
lot
else
other
than
sweetness
to
the
table
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
ever
tried
from
this
brewery
and
im
already
a
fan
this
was
a
really
good
nut
brown
ale
o
good
nut
brown
ale
here
nothing
exceptional
but
definitely
drinkable
it
hits
the
style
on
the
head
a
rich
malty
smooth
that
is
sweet
but
balanced
caramelish
nutty
slightly
chocolaty
with
a
smooth
texture
i
had
a
second
bottle
with
leftovers
from
thanksgiving
and
it
went
well
with
the
freerange
turkey
and
the
gravy
o
id
like
more
from
the
body
of
this
beer
for
some
reason
and
i
think
the
taste
could
be
a
little
bolder
i
was
not
mad
about
the
madtown
nutbrown
definitely
di
not
rank
in
my
top
ten
for
brown
ales
the
beer
pour
a
nice
brownish
amber
with
ok
head
that
did
not
lace
the
scent
carried
earthy
and
malt
aromas
but
nothing
out
of
control
the
taste
was
more
like
a
watered
caramel
coffee
the
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
it
was
just
ok
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
tasty
brown
ale
worth
a
try
and
well
worth
picking
up
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
o
nutrich
and
earthy
the
dry
toasted
notes
seem
to
overwhelm
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
for
a
significant
balance
shift
to
the
nutty
side
madtown
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
standards
its
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
when
it
comes
to
brown
ales
the
sweetness
hides
providing
minimal
balance
and
its
dryness
becomes
cloying
this
is
a
nice
balance
of
floral
hops
mediumlow
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
a
slightly
roasted
malt
its
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
but
a
great
allaround
brew
nice
brown
easy
drinking
id
buy
it
again
this
poured
out
as
an
orange
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
retention
was
decent
the
lacing
was
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
lightly
roasted
and
sweet
smelling
plenty
of
malt
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
malty
as
well
with
a
decent
roasted
flavor
as
well
not
bitter
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
nicely
carbonated
and
smooth
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
worth
checking
out
oa
plain
brown
ale
tastes
more
like
an
english
version
not
much
character
here
but
drinkable
o
brown
ales
dont
get
a
whole
lot
of
love
but
this
is
a
good
one
its
quite
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
glad
to
recommend
this
brew
overall
although
brown
ales
should
be
malty
this
one
misses
the
mark
entirely
to
me
it
is
too
sweet
and
because
of
it
i
missed
the
subtle
malty
nuances
that
a
traditional
english
brown
has
overall
smells
like
its
going
to
taste
better
not
awful
but
not
worth
looking
for
new
glarus
is
not
making
fat
squriell
this
year
but
that
is
ok
because
we
have
this
good
stuff
o
overall
a
really
good
brown
ale
i
liked
their
porter
a
twinge
better
but
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
lot
of
nuts
and
malts
to
it
worth
checking
out
m
good
carbonation
bite
malt
toasty
and
a
fair
aftertaste
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
the
best
compliment
i
can
give
it
is
that
in
no
occasion
would
i
not
want
to
be
drinking
one
if
you
can
find
it
its
even
better
on
tap
and
unfairly
good
when
dispensed
at
the
brewery
o
great
beer
with
rich
malt
character
not
a
must
have
for
the
style
but
bashes
a
newcastle
over
the
head
and
buries
it
pours
a
solid
translucent
brown
with
subtle
amber
hues
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
and
light
retention
nutty
malt
aroma
accompanied
by
a
fair
amount
of
hops
citrus
and
grapefruit
in
faint
amounts
with
that
typical
and
characteristic
ale
asylum
aroma
hard
to
explain
exactly
what
that
is
other
than
a
gingery
hop
smell
sweet
caramel
up
front
cocoa
nutty
malts
grapefruit
and
white
grape
in
the
faintest
amount
slight
tartness
to
it
medium
body
the
finish
is
a
bit
off
but
still
very
drinkable
and
still
very
good
this
wasnt
anything
revolutionary
but
was
wellbalanced
and
an
easy
drinker
simple
and
enjoyable
brown
ales
are
mostly
not
an
exciting
category
and
this
one
ontap
at
the
brewery
is
no
exception
it
was
however
beter
than
average
for
the
style
because
of
its
rich
malt
and
creamy
mouthfeel
too
sweet
light
brown
colour
with
creamy
head
it
looks
like
its
on
nitro
which
it
is
not
poured
from
a
stubby
brown
bottle
with
some
kind
of
date
code
that
is
smeared
off
of
the
bottle
a
good
looking
beer
for
sure
clear
chestnut
brown
with
a
few
floaties
that
lead
me
to
think
this
one
could
be
a
tad
past
its
prime
and
a
massive
khaki
head
that
settles
slowly
to
soft
peaks
roasted
almonds
and
barley
in
the
aroma
nice
roasty
and
malty
flavors
with
pecanlike
nuttiness
and
plenty
of
rich
malt
that
is
well
balanced
with
mild
floral
hoppiness
medium
lean
bodied
and
creamy
with
smooth
carbonation
a
tasty
brew
overall
very
good
for
the
style
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
pairs
together
the
carmel
and
nut
flavors
very
well
it
doesnt
leave
too
much
of
a
lingering
flavor
but
that
helps
with
the
overall
drinkability
because
of
how
smooth
it
feels
as
it
is
going
down
the
sweetness
is
also
not
overly
demanding
and
thus
it
goes
on
the
top
of
the
list
0nice
option
when
wanting
more
than
one
but
you
want
the
experience
of
a
darker
beer
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
and
one
that
any
of
you
brown
ale
fans
out
there
should
give
a
try
this
madison
brewery
has
a
knack
for
brewing
some
quality
brew
do
slight
lack
of
taste
makes
for
mad
drinkability
this
one
was
kind
of
all
over
the
place
as
far
as
my
individual
ratings
went
on
the
plus
side
mad
town
nut
brown
looks
great
and
goods
down
either
whereas
the
aroma
aspect
and
taste
leaves
some
to
be
desired
would
recommend
to
brownsession
ale
fans
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
tan
head
the
smell
was
weak
but
had
some
maltyness
the
taste
was
malty
no
nut
flavor
as
the
name
implies
and
a
bit
light
for
a
brown
ale
there
could
have
been
more
flavor
but
easy
to
drink
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
beer
either
perfect
for
those
times
when
i
want
something
thats
just
easy
to
drink
without
the
complexities
of
the
belgians
ris
that
i
normally
drink
a
good
representation
of
the
style
one
ill
buy
again
this
american
brown
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
scent
of
hops
it
has
a
slight
hops
taste
as
well
but
a
more
overpowering
nutty
flavor
that
reminded
me
of
pecans
for
being
a
more
flavorful
beer
it
drank
rather
smooth
definetly
a
must
try
overall
despite
my
general
preference
for
scottishstyle
ales
this
brown
has
seen
more
glass
time
than
the
lake
louie
warped
speed
scotch
i
bought
at
the
same
time
its
inspiring
me
along
with
new
glarus
fat
squirrel
to
brew
a
brown
next
a
really
nice
example
of
a
brown
ale
no

great

also
perhaps
some

and

drinkable
i
dunno
i
dont
think
id
go
back
to
this
one
but
id
do
it
before
a
lot
of
others
simple
average
it
didnt
really
make
the
greatest
head
not
the
most
aromatic
beer
smells
like
it
tastes
kind
of
caramel
in
taste
color
and
smell
its
really
a
pretty
good
beer
and
is
something
that
i
think
that
i
could
make
nice
mouthfeel
and
its
nice
to
drink
not
stunning
but
certainly
not
bad
its
something
good
to
drink

a

thin
creme
head
flavor
is
kind
of
slightly
sweet
with
nut
tones
and
wood
tones
as
well
slight
tangy
edge
but
it
doesnt
overshadow
the
slightly
sweet
nutty
tone
that
is
there
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
quite
easy
to
drink
bump
up
the
nuts
and
bring
down
the
tangy
just
a
wee
bit
and
i
am
happier
drinkability
is
solid
very
fresh
and
satisfying
nut
brown
with
a
very
drinkable
aura
the
brew
works
on
all
levels
drinkable
well
proportioned
nicely
concentrated
and
delicious
another
great
brew
from

asylum
cheers
overall
a
good
easily
drinkable
brown
ale
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
minimal
head
the
smell
is
malty
with
a
nutty
coffee
tone
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
coffee
and
chocolate
very
malty
and
rich
it
has
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
low
so
it
goes
down
really
smooth
i
will
be
picking
up
a
sixer
of
this
next
time
out
this
beer
is
essentially
everything
i
want
in

nutbrown

nutty
check

check

check
poured
a
deep
amber
color
and
smelled
somewhat
like
an
nutty
amber
im
from
milwaukee
and
have
been
loving
everything
out
of
the
ale
asylum
of
madison
its
great
to
see
some
brewerys
outside
of
new
glarus
make
a
good
name
for
themselves
in
wisconsin
were
known
for
our
watered
down
sht
beers
but
brewerys
like
this
will
definitely
help
to
change
that
d
a
well
brewed
nut
brown
id
have
another
had
this
on
on
tap
at
the
brewery
when
poured
it
looks
like
nothing
special
but
the
taste
offers
a
lot
for
a
saturated
beer
style
nice
and
hoppy
at
first
sip
but
the
malts
really
come
through
at
the
back
end
very
strong
flavor
for
a
brown
ale
while
still
being
mellow
easy
to
drink
but
gets
filling
after
a
while
nice
beer
to
have
sitting
around
in
the
winter
pours
a
cloudy
honeyamber
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
smells
just
like
the
name
a
nice
malty
scent
with
some
nuttiness
and
some
hops
in
the
background
first
taste
reveals
a
wonderfully
light
but
flavorful
malt
with
some
roasted
almonds
and
a
very
mild
banana
flavor
in
the
background
followed
by
a
milder
hop
note
and
a
fairly
clean
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
somewhat
lighterbodied
this
brew
is
surprisingly
refreshing
and
very
much
fits
ale
asylums
solid
fullmalt
style
a
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
while
out
on
the
town
in
madison
i
thiink
the
first
time
i
tried
this
beer
on
tap
i
was
a
little
offput
byt
he
strong
hop
flavors
well
give
this
one
a
little
time
in
the
bottle
and
when
the
hop
oils
mellow
out
look
out
this
is
one
of
the
only
lighter
abv
beers
i
can
say
gets
better
with
age
not
being
the
biggest
fan
of
nutbrowns
this
is
the
one
i
buy
when
im
in
the
mood
for
one
and
its
local
which
is
great
d
a
great
nut
brown
ale
i
wish
i
had
more
this
beer
pours
a
semiclear
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
rather
slowly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
milk
chocolate
caramel
and
a
firm
nuttiness
the
taste
is
nuttier
and
has
more
caramel
than
the
aroma
and
only
had
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
ale
i
could
happily
drink
this
again
notes
from
72307
overall
a
nice
brown
ale
in
retrospect
taste
reminds
me
of
fat
tire
not
bad
while
the
aroma
and
flavors
were
pretty
tight
for
the
style
i
wish
that
they
could
have
been
a
bit
more
assertive
and
the
overall
feel
could
had
been
just
a
touch
beefier
to
help
support
them
better
this
was
my
first
beer
from
ale
asylum
and
i
look
forward
to
better
selections
from
them
down
the
road
pours
a
chestnut
brown
with
unfiltered
particles
floating
in
suspension
of
the
beers
body
nose
consists
of
sweet
malt
breadiness
like
a
baked
pie
crust
and
brown
sugar
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
soft
taste
consists
of
caramel
and
malt
that
baked
pie
crust
aroma
is
featured
again
here
in
the
flavor
not
much
else
is
going
on
here
overall
this
was
a
huge
let
down
aroma
just
like
the
taste
is
pleasant
but
not
complex
malts
mostly
caramel
in
a
light
to
medium
bodied
brew
decent
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
here
its
not
a
terrible
stab
at
a
brown
ale
but
there
are
things
here
that
dont
quite
mesh
its
easily
the
weakest
link
in
ale
asylums
bottled
line
id
vote
to
bench
this
and
put
big
slick
stout
in
mass
production
or
sticky
mcdoogle
or
really
anything
else
poured
on
tap
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
had
a
nice
acorn
color
with
about
a
34
inch
white
head
once
settled
there
was
a
nice
cap
with
good
lacing
down
the
sides
there
was
a
mild
bitter
smell
with
a
backbone
of
nutty
tones
nothing
was
overly
noticeable
with
the
smell
of
this
brew
and
that
followed
suit
with
the
taste
this
was
a
thin
beer
with
mild
carbonation
and
only
a
slight
nutty
flavor
some
hints
of
roasted
malts
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
a
forgettable
beer
not
great
but
ok
with
the
prices
there
were
better
choices
to
make
in
the
aa
lineup
dthe
least
satisfying
collection
from
this
brewery
ive
yet
had
the
overall
taste
is
enjoyable
and
its
fairly
smooth
but
the
lightness
doesnt
do
justice
to
the
flavors
and
the
ale
has
no
equilibrium
d
pretty
good
but
not
all
that
great
drinkable
this
was
somehat
underwhelming
pours
a
mostly
clear
ruby
brown
but
with
no
head
to
speak
of
toffee
roasted
nuts
caramel
and
rum
in
the
nose
suprisingly
thin
malts
in
the
taste
almost
no
residual
sugars
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
mostly
astringent
like
cold
tea
minimal
carbonation
perhaps
this
one
was
a
bit
past
its
prime
even
though
i
purchased
it
a
few
months
ago
and
its
been
in
the
fridge
ever
since
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
from
the
fast
moving
carbonation
its
somewhere
between
light
and
medium
bodied
making
it
easy
to
drink
overall
its
an
easy
drinking
brown
that
just
seems
to
be
a
little
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
to
me
nothing
really
grabs
me
in
and
makes
me
want
to
come
back
to
this
one
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
lacing
is
decent
all
the
way
through
mild
aroma
of
creamy
carmel
with
just
a
hint
of
aroma
hops
taste
is
very
good
creamy
and
carmel
dominate
the
flavors
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
excellent
smooth
creamy
feel
and
very
well
carbonated
i
will
definately
be
drinking
this
one
again
this
beer
pured
a
nice
red
color
with
a
tan
head
aroma
was
a
bit
of
light
caramel
but
was
not
overly
odoriferous
flavor
was
a
bit
light
and
a
bit
of
toffee
and
caramel
body
was
light
and
there
was
not
a
tremendous
amount
of
mouthfeel
not
bad
and
recommended
but
far
from
spectacular
man
this
is
a
good
beer
poured
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
and
some
lace
hazy
brown
color
very
nutty
characteristics
absolutely
a
session
beer
malty
and
light
hop
not
too
sweet
great
mouthfeel
quite
satisfying
finish
is
a
bit
dry
at
first
then
slightly
sweet
nice
white
head
with
tight
bubbles
that
lasted
for
awhile
looks
ok
in
the
glass
with
a
mud
brown
color
but
for
me
the
smell
isnt
all
that
pleasant
some
solid
malt
but
the
spiceness
of
the
hop
doesnt
compliment
for
me
overly
sweet
malt
has
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
not
a
lot
of
additional
depth
to
it
though
the
aftertaset
isnt
bad
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
though
reading
some
of
the
reviews
online
i
seem
to
be
in
the
minority
on
this
one
oh
well
i
would
pass
it
buy
for
every
other
ale
asylum
beer
ive
tried
smoothness
reigns
here
and
flavor
is
in
abundance
moderate
carbonation
medium
bodied
and
the
sweetness
is
tempered
with
light
hops
at
each
sip
grapenuts
comes
to
mind
so
there
must
be
a
good
amount
of
barley
in
this
theres
a
nutty
sweetness
with
a
sour
apple
tang
that
im
guessing
is
from
the
yeast
tastes
good
but
it
feels
muddled
and
could
use
more
definition
one
pint
was
enough
doesnt
seem
much
like
a
session
ale
ive
heard
good
things
about
ale
asylum
i
wish
i
could
have
made
it
to
the
brewpub
on
my
most
recent
trip
to
madison
but
i
was
able
to
locate
a
few
bottles
to
ease
the
disappointment
if
madtown
nut
brown
is
representative
im
even
more
excited
about
drinking
the
rest
of
their
offerings
than
i
was
previously
this
is
good
beer
overall
like
all
the
beers
at
the
ale
asylum
get
it
a
good
beer
maybe
could
be
jacked
up
a
little
sweetness
may
hinder
its
drinkability
a
bit
but
its
quite
welcoming
and
accessible
nicely
done
had
a
nice
tight
foamy
head
that
laced
graciously
down
the
glass
as
it
was
consumed
had
quite
a
bit
of
hop
character
for
nut
brown
it
almost
seemed
as
i
was
tasting
a
dark
pale
ale
it
did
not
have
the
malt
to
backup
the
hops
besides
that
it
was
a
delicious
beer
to
the
last
drop
much
prefer
their
porter
or
stout
very
flavorful
i
found
the
nuttiness
drowned
out
by
the
creamy
butter
and
caramel
im
just
not
sure
about
the
flavors
melding
together
well
or
being
top
notch
individually
to
begin
with
this
is
also
their
first
attempt
at
bottling
so
i
will
definitely
try
it
on
tap
next
time
drinkability
ok
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
drinkability
good
drinkability
great
session
brown
but
one
that
has
plenty
of
flavor
fullbodied
with
a
great
balance
of
nuts
fruits
and
chocolate
simply
awesome
dthis
beer
is
a
work
of
art
must
nut
brown
ales
are
very
bad
and
the
malts
taste
watered
down
and
stale
but
this
beer
has
fresh
flavors
with
an
actual
dry
nutty
note
good
complexity
but
very
easy
to
drink
was
expecting
a
lighter
thinner
brew
turns
out
it
was
quite
thick
and
the
taste
was
approaching
an
russian
imperial
stout
while
not
a
bad
beer
i
felt
it
would
have
been
more
apt
under
the
russian
imperial
stout
style
ah
yes
the
brew
hid
the
alcohol
well
and
tasted
better
as
it
warmed
cocoa
and
coffee
on
the
nose
mixed
with
roast
malts
with
a
good
balance
between
the
added
aromas
and
the
malt
driven
aromas
pours
brilliant
deep
dark
brown
under
a
2
persistent
rocky
foam
cap
that
produces
fine
lace
the
palate
closely
follows
the
nose
with
malt
derived
coffee
and
cocoa
flavors
well
balanced
with
the
added
coffee
and
cocoa
nibs
all
pulled
together
in
the
finish
with
a
bitter
hop
accent
supplementing
bitter
notes
from
the
roast
malts
and
the
added
flavors
there
is
a
fine
ribbon
of
sweetness
throughout
which
recedes
during
the
finish
with
a
grainy
coffee
cocoa
dryness
and
hop
bitterness
medium
full
body
and
medium
carbonation
muddy
brown
with
ruby
edges
sweet
and
nutty
nose
the
flavor
profile
is
unfortunately
infiltrated
by
a
funny
floral
taste
on
the
finish
that
does
not
quite
mix
with
everything
else
interesting
beer
a
brown
ale
that
plays
like
a
porter
or
a
stout
great
beer
i
loved
the
coffee
back
taste
it
was
just
enough
feel
again
feels
and
drinks
more
like
a
porterstout
that
what
i
am
used
to
as
a
brown
ale
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
with
the
addition
of
coffee
and
chocolate
i
might
have
guessed
this
was
a
porter
good
solid
beer
but
not
great
one
of
my
favorite
browns
along
with
rogues
hazelnut
good
coffee
flavor
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
m
medium
bodied
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
finishes
medium
dry
overall
board
meeting
is
a
really
solid
brown
ale
however
i
think
a
lowering
of
the
level
of
carbonation
and
a
little
less
bitterness
would
be
a
big
improvement
3
75
overall
i
doubt
that
anybody
would
pick
this
as
a
brown
ale
in
a
blind
tasting
but
whatever
style
you
want
to
call
it
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
the
genius
here
is
instead
of
using
a
lot
or
any
roasted
malts
they
brewed
an
imperial
brown
ale
and
kept
it
fairly
dry
and
quaffable
but
used
the
cacao
nibs
and
coffee
to
give
it
the
flavor
of
a
robust
porter
or
stout
you
would
think
an
8
5
dark
beer
would
be
a
sipper
but
i
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
o
recommended
for
coffee
lovers
solid
brown
ale
im
used
to
these
types
of
flavors
in
porters
and
stouts
but
not
in
brown
ales
until
now
im
glad
port
brewing
has
ventured
out
and
taken
my
taste
buds
where
they
havent
been
yet
aftertaste
is
bitter
coffee
with
a
hoppy
edge
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
ibis
market
in
mission
hills
o
this
is
a
nice
full
flavored
brown
ale
with
good
flavors
and
decent
complexity
it
hits
all
the
right
notes
and
has
solid
balance
on
tap
at
cannery
row
brewing
in
monterey
i
had
no
idea
this
was
8
5
but
it
was
immediately
clear
this
was
a
delicious
brown
ale
the
body
is
relatively
light
for
the
weight
i
figured
this
wasnt
more
than
6
or
6
5
isnt
of
a
brown
ales
usual
slow
rolling
notes
this
beer
had
pointed
notes
of
cocoa
and
coffee
dark
toasted
bread
a
couple
touches
of
dark
berries
and
then
more
coffee
easiest
one
of
the
biggest
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
i
want
more
o
good
brown
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
one
o
this
beer
does
a
great
job
of
featuring
its
additions
and
is
quite
tasty
as
such
that
being
said
i
feel
it
could
use
a
bit
more
hopalt
support
for
balance
as
the
additions
are
almost
all
i
taste
that
would
take
it
from
very
good
to
great
overall
a
very
well
made
beer
i
enjoyed
it
very
solid
ale
warms
nicely
whether
stout
or
brown
ale
this
is

agree
it
goes
quite
well
with
a
brisk
fall
day
what
a

be

great
autumn
brown

overall
this
is
a

beer
it
is
not
too
roasted
and
is
not
overly
sweet
either
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
brown
ale
style
but
i
enjoyed
having
something
different
sn
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
they
never

overall
classic
sn
body
might
like
it
a

heavier
for
the
brown

still
one
of
the
better
ones
that
i
have
tried
despite
the
fact
that
my
case
was
a
little
bit
old
glad
than
sn
brought
this
one
back
overall
this
is
pretty
nice
brown
ale
i
cannot
complain
here
as
for
as
brown
ales
are
concerned
the
only
flaw
if
any
is
the
bitterness
is
a
little
out
of
place
stylistically
but
this
a
fine
beer
from
sierra

pours
out
a
clear

with
a
thin

from
the
us
i
was
pissed
when
i
heard
they
were
discontinuing
tumbler
back
in

a
rep
told
me
they
were
going
to
bring
it
back
in
the
fall
pack
same
coffee
chocolate

smoky

notes
that
i
love
in

reminds

of
some

but
with
a

im
imagining
this
is
what
a
sweet
and
mildly
chocolately
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
would
resemble
and
it
does
have
an
earthy
flavour
of
what
i
imagine
autumn
leaves
to
taste
like
in
a
good
way
while
i
havent
been
enamoured
with
brown
ales
in
general
i
think
it
is
often
the
burntsugar
taste
that
puts
me
off
this
is
one
of
the
most
palatable
ive
had
reviewed
26
october
2014
overall
i
really
enjoy
brown
ales
but
am
not
a
fan
of
smokey
flavors
i
cant
really
criticize
the
beer
but
it
not
to
my
particular
tastes
due
to
the
smoke
i
would
probably
rate
it
much
higher
without
the
smoked
malts
great
brown
color
gives
off
a
chocolatey
cardboard
aroma
the
scent
is
a
touch
chalky
toasted
and
nutty
the
flavor
is
dry
chocolate
malt
smoky
shoe
leather
toasted
nutty
and
a
bit
of
graham
cracker
overall
not
the
best
brown
but
still
tasty
enough
tastes
much
better
than
i
remember
mmm
bitter
and
chocolatey
with
a
touch
of
tobacco
almost
like
a
porter
but
lighter
of
course
somewhat
dry
and
spicy
not
sweet
like
you
would
expect
well
rounded
and
super
drinkable
now
i
wish
they
would
bring
this
back
in
six
packs
o
just
a
typical
brown
ale
nothing
special
but
still
good
give
it
a
try

poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
two
fingers
of
beige
head
that
settled
to
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
and
stayed
to
the
end
the
aroma
is
sweet
roasty
malt
caramel
and
just
a
slight
hint
of
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
dark
roasted
malt
with
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
for
such
a
dark
beer
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
to
add
a
nice
feel
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
one
i
may
have
to
look
into
more
often
o
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
after
missing
out
last
season
but
its
more
americanized
than
id
hoped
though
im
not
surprised
it
misses
the
lighter
toasted
notes
and
buttery
goodness
of
the
english
brown
ale
but
it
is
very
nice
in
the
vein
of
the
black
ipa
loaded
with
hops
that
are
tamed
considerably
by
the
darker
malt
o
i
really
enjoy
this
one
its
really
perfect
for
the
transition
from
summer
to
fall
great
for
those
warm
days
cool
nights
o
3

a
fall
staple
im
glad
they
figured
out
a
way
to
keep
this
on
the
shelves
in
the
fall
even
if
its
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
090512
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
although
touted
as
an
ale
i
find
this
leaning
more
to
the
porter
side
as
im
not
a
pronounced
hops
fan
id
prefer
a
bit
more
subtlety
flavor
galore
but
just
not
to
my
taste
i
really
enjoyed
this
brown
balanced
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
well
made
beer
people
its
not
too
sweet
not
to
bitter
not
to
thin
but
not
super
thick
in
the
mouthfeel
department
it
really
is
one
of
the
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
had
for
sure
enjoying
a
2013
vintage
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
an
enormous
frothy
head
nothing
says
autumn
like
a
tumbler
everything
a
fall
seasonal
should
be
super
malty
with
toasted
nut
flavors
well
done
sierra
nevada
what
a
complex
brew
possibly
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
paired
it
with
some
aged
gouda
and
they
matched
perfectly
get
some
medium
brown
with
some
clarity
in
addition
to
the
off
white
head
soft
smoke
note
upfront
chocolate
white
bread
mixed
nuts
and
brown
sugar
with
a
hint
of
smoke
a
bit
of
nuttiness
almost
like
a
chocolate
covered
nut
of
nondescript
origin
toward
the
end
very
smooth
a
bit
creamy
and
has
a
medium
dry
finish
medium
body
delicious
autumn
ale
i
love
that
is
has
a
lot
of
flavor
but
a
low
abv
im
not
a
cigar
person
but
if
you
were
looking
for
something
lighter
to
enjoy
with
your
smoke
this
could
be
it
i
could
see
this
with
meaty
stew
or
for
a
different
route
some
spicy
jambalaya
the
spice
would
round
out
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
nicely
nice
brown
ale
with
good
flavor
and
aroma
worth
a
try
and
easy
to
enjoy
beyond
that
nothing
exceptional
this
was
the
first
brown
ale
i
fell
in
love
with
ive
had
better
brown
ales
since
but
this
is
still
a
good
very
drinkable
beer
safety
drink
when
in
a
nyc
bar
during
the
fall
o
a
solid
interpretation
of
a
classic
and
often
ignored
style
o
enjoyable
with
the
cooler
fall
weather
that
just
moved
in
nutty
bready
toasted
chocolate
and
caramel
lots
of
lace
rings
easy
drinking
good
value
o
a
good
brown
ale
overall
not
terribly
complex
but
quite
enjoyable
overall
just
soooo
good
wish
it
were
around
all
the
time
i
realize
brown
ales
arent
a
favorite
here
but
this
is
a
superbly
balanced
extremely
drinkable
low
abv
beer
i
think
its
straight
up
outstanding
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
a
great
accompaniment
with
food
overall
i
can
see
why
people
miss
this
beer
but
i
wasnt
expecting
to
love
this
one
easily
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
with
amazing
balance
and
flavor
literally
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
id
like
in
a
beer
definitely
a
must
try
for
the
fall
beer
list
i
go
to
sierra
nevada
when
i
want
a
beer
done
right
sn
brews
staples
this
is
a
staple
brown
ale
smooth
sweet
smokey
and
nutty
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
toffee
great
brown
ale
great
beer
altogether
this
beer
is
just
smooth
creamy
and
easydrinking
but
with
great
flavors
great
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
good
3finger
offwhite
head
good
carbonation
with
some
sediment
left
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
hazel
nut
and
brown
sugar
very
nice
the
taste
is
close
to
the
aroma
but
not
as
strong
but
pretty
good
overall
with
all
the
flavors
mentioned
above
coming
through
lots
of
the
hazelnut
nut
flavor
in
the
mix
a
slight
dry
smoke
finish
but
still
good
pours
clear
dark
brown
with
1
inch
off
white
head
smells
awesome
aromas
of
malts
and
nuttiness
hazelnut
aroma
pronounced
and
rich
also
some
brown
sugar
on
the
nose
medium
high
carbonation
taste
is
very
nutty
not
hazelnut
or
sweet
but
more
like
dry
roasted
nuts
was
hoping
for
more
sweet
malty
flavor
in
the
taste
slightly
smokey
aftertaste
as
it
warms
o
this
was
a
beer
well
beyond
its
standard
drink
by
period
which
actually
speaks
well
of
it
because
it
held
up
surprisingly
well
when
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
i
knew
i
had
to
try
it
because
it
was
something
i
might
never
see
again
im
glad
i
did
because
it
was
an
impressive
brew
even
with
the
age
on
it
hope
it
comes
around
again
frighteningly
easy
to
drink
very
smooth
throughout
and
with
a
crisp
bitter
finish
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
and
again
sierra
nevada
doesnt
disappoint
whilst
not
the
very
best
from
the
brewery
that
ive
tried
this
one
is
certainly
a
good
one
o
not
a
bad
ale
by
any
means
interesting
flavors
are
present
but
it
lacks
the
smoothness
that
i
associate
with
an
above
average
brown
ale
i
would
drink
it
again
but
wont
seek
it
out
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
hadnt
been
retired
i
would
definitely
get
it
again
oh
well
o
pretty
good
brown
ale
its
discontinued
now
so
ill
probably
never
drink
it
again
but
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
o
its
a
shame
sn
didnt
see
it
fit
to
brew
this
after
this
year
this
has
been
a
staple
autumn
brown
ale
i
know
everyone
has
been
all
geared
up
on
hops
in
more
recent
times
im
one
of
those
people
but
theres
great
beers
in
other
styles
like
this
one
that
suffer
due
to
demand
of
other
product
maybe
one
day
it
will
return
for
now
so
long
old
friend
anyway
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
find
this
dont
miss
a
chance
to
try
it
cheers
o
not
my
beer
to
go
to

crying

this
is
a
nice
roasted
brew
for
those
cool
fall
nights
there
are
some
more
robust
and
flavorful
brown
ales
out
there
but
this
is
very
drinkable
and
worth
a
try

it

lingers
slight

with
just
the

this
is
one
of
sns
not

brews
and
should
be
well
received
by

a
great

its
a

ive
had
better
brown
ales
but
this
isnt
the
worst
brown
ale
out
there
especially
at
the
typical
sierra
nevada
price
point
this
feels
kind
of
snpa
without
the
hops
i
would
definitely
take
surly
bender
or
dfh
indian
brown
over
this
any
day
overall
a
refreshing
and
tasty
brew
balancing
on
the
edge
of
a
delicate
hop
malt
balance
not
my
favorite
but
quite
nice
nonetheless
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
and
liked
it
very
much
i
found
it
balanced
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
tastie
im
looking
forward
to
my
next
one
o
i
figured
i
better
review
this
one
before
it
goes
into
retirement
it
is
one
fo
the
more
flavorful
beers
i
have
come
across
at
this
low
an
abv
rich
aroma
and
flavor
full
of
nutty
caramel
malts
just
a
hint
of
hops
perfect
for
a
crisp
fall
evening
i
like
to
grab
this
at
least
a
few
times
each
year
so
it
will
definitely
be
missed
o
a
good
dinner
drink
not
really
a
sipper
not
as
much
malt
evident
as
i
like
in
my
browns
not
quite
getting
why
so
many
seem
to
be
upset
that
this
one
is
in
its
last
offering
its
just
not
as
special
as
other
sns
i
have
tried
however
it
is
above
average
for
a
mainstream
craft
brown
awesome
brown
ale
from
sierra
nevada
not
sure
if
this
is
my
favorite
offering
from
sn
but
if
its
not
its
very
close
the
smokey
deep
brown
flavor
is
great
for
fall
colder
weather
or
maybe
after
dinner
theres
a
sweetness
to
it
thats
outrageously
smooth
flows
right
down
the
back
of
your
throat
o
gonna
be
sad
to
see
this
gone
and
replaced
by
flipside
next
year
it
isnt
my
favorite
brown
ale
but
by
golly
it
hits
the
spot
ill
have
to
buy
another
sixer
before
its
gone
i
now
remember
having
two
that
night
even
though
i
had
an
important
meeting
early
the
next
day
since
they
were
so
good
even
after
cellering
for
a
year
this
remains
my
favorite
brown
ale
ive
yet
to
try
the
body
is
so
well
balanced
and
complex
yet
completely
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
for
incredible
drinkability
yet
has
enough
character
to
hold
ones
interest
and
complement
the
complex
flavor
profile
tumber
claims
to
be
the
ultimate
autumn
beer
and
id
have
to
agree
i
feel
fortunate
to
have
this
beer
associated
with
one
of
the
defining
moments
in
my
life
3
cheers
to
you
sierra
nevada
for
continuing
to
offer
the
world
your
pioneering
artisanal
skills
and
offering
a
different
expression
of
your
hoppygoodness
prowess
and
again
thank
you
for
a
refreshing
interpretation
of
a
fall
season
drinker
o
on
the
bottle
it
says
perfect
for
an
autumn
afternoon
and
i
couldnt
agree
more
the
style
itself
isnt
the
most
complex
but
i
really
enjoy
brown
ales
anyway
this
one
plays
a
little
more
to
the
roastychocolaty
qualities
than
the
malt
sweetness
but
it
works
so
well
overall
solid
beer
it
isnt
amazing
if
you
like
brown
ales
you
should
give
this
a
try
if
not
you
arent
missing
much
but
you
still
might
want
to
give
it
a
try
a
good
representation
of
the
style
the
packaging
gets
me
every
time
its
just
so
beautiful
it
does
a
number
on
my
brain
gets
me
psyched
for
the
chilliness
and
autumn
nights
i
still
cant
fully
put
to
words
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
its
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
theres
an
overall
aesthetic
that
is
immensely
appealing
it
affects
me
to
me
brown
ales
are
one
of
the
fine
signatures
of
fall
this
one
is
good
and
kind
of
skunky
smelling
it
has
a
bronzeish
brown
color
this
one
reminded
me
of
a
brown
ale
from
bear
republic
a
dark
brown
ale
is
always
a
better
brown
ale
as
far
as
taste
but
this
one
is
different
than
a
lot
of
brown
ales
ive
tried
sierra
nevada
is
usually
a
little
hoppy
for
my
taste
but
this
one
goes
down
real
nice
and
should
be
everyones
goto
beer
for
the
fall
season
but
watch
out
it
tastes
totally
different
out
of
the
tap
at
a
bar
this
is
a
very
hoppy
brew
with
a
good
amount
of
toasty
malt
this
is
a
really
flavorful
beer
at
its
abv
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
beginners
as
its
has
a
good
assertive
hop
profile
but
also
that
malt
to
back
it
up
this
is
a
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
very
smooth
and
flavorful
great
for
a
cool
autumn
evening
overall
easy
drinking
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
weakness
is
disappointing
as
the
aroma
was
very
nice
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
coming
through
in
this
beer
not
bad
but
not
great
just
not
a
lot
of
flavor
or
complexity
coming
through
at
all
there
are
a
lot
of
better
browns
out
there
overall
as
my
friend
said
when
he
first
had
this
beer
this
tastes
exactly
how
brown
should
taste
this
is
an
excellent
offering
from
a
brewing
company
that
tends
to
be
hit
or
miss
for
me
i
definitely
will
be
picking
this
up
in
the
falls
to
come
o
i
have
to
buy
a
sixer
of
this
every
season
as
it
signals
fall
is
approaching
and
the
100
degree
texas
days
are
numbered
im
not
a
fan
of
brown
ales
as
they
are
usually
very
lacking
in
flavor
to
me
this
is
one
exception
its
still
not
mind
blowing
but
i
find
it
to
be
a
good
example
of
what
the
style
should
be
i
can
definetly
enjoy
a
sixer
of
this
but
only
one
a
year
always
enjoy
this
as
it
remimds
me
of
fall
aka
hunting
season
typically
the
first
beer
i
drink
on
opening
day
as
a
fall
tradition
roasted
malts
and
great
aroma
sets
the
mood
just
right
for
opening
day
out
in
the
woods
looking
for
a
trophy
buck
to
put
on
my
wall
and
share
with
my
family
this
is
very
good
its
one
of
my
lesserliked
sn
brews
but
still
always
worth
getting
i
look
forward
to
having
it
again
as
it
gets
colder
i
will
get
it
again
im
amending
this
brew
mainly
for
score
i
obtained
three
bottles
of
this
excellent
beer
as
part
of
a
seasonal
12
pack
sadly
the
only
way
to
obtain
it
now
this
brew
is
nutty
a
little
buttery
rich
and
has
great
balance
one
of
the
best
browns
out
there
overall
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
bad
beer
from
sierra
nevada
and
this
is
no
exception
this
is
a
really
good
brown
ale
and
one
of
my
go
to
beers
during
the
fall
months
overall
finally
tried
this
very
fresh
and
im
glad
i
did
a
great
fall
seasonal
and
for
me
a
better
fall
beer
than
many
oktoberfests
definitely
a
must
try
overall
quite
a
nice
brown
ale
i
love
seeing
this
come
out
every
year
its
kind
of
become
my
kickoff
beer
for
fall
football
season
and
the
holidays
for
me
poured
into
a
tall
goblet
nice
head
dark
brown
ale
that
has
a
reddish
tinge
when
held
to
light
aroma
is
nutty
coffee
light
caramel
molasses
taste
is
very
malty
with
the
aforementioned
aromas
present
in
the
flavor
nicely
balanced
by
hops
appropriately
carbonated
and
well
structured
and
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
into
this
5
5
abv
brew
as
i
said
i
welcome
its
arrival
each
year
with
the
autumn
seasonals
and
recommend
one
of
the
more
refreshing
hoppier
browns
ive
had
most
are
bready
and
heavy
nice
balance
and
lingering
flavor
earthy
aroma
and
some
brown
sugar
but
not
overly
sweet
and
very
drinkable
nice
transition
beer
from
pale
ale
to
porter
two
of
my
alltime
favorites
a
slightly
above
average
beer
was
alright
but
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
this
is
a
great
beer
to
transition
from
summer
to
autumn
as
its
fairly
light
for
the
style
it
smells
of
roasted
malt
brown
sugar
and
nuts
the
taste
is
sweet
a
bit
too
sweet
i
feel
but
there
are
some
nice
flavors
here
specifically
brown
sugar
bread
and
nut
i
couldnt
taste
the
hops
but
im
sure
theyre
there
somewhere
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
satisfying
and
for
as
sweet
as
this
is
its
not
sticky
overall
i
like
this
but
it
would
work
better
as
maybe
a
dessert
beer
say
with
some
pumpkin
pie
as
it
is
its
a
little
too
sweet
but
otherwise
quite
tasty
o
nothing
spectacular
but
well
above
average
for
the
style
it
does
remind
me
of
an
autumn
afternoon
so
bonus
points
there
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
i
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
the
verdict
good
beer
nothing
great
or
earthshattering
just
another
good
solid
brew
from
sierra
nevada
im
still
waiting
for
this
winters
celebration
ale
though
this
tastes
like
autumn
absolutely
perfect
for
the
season
and
one
of
the
best
browns
ive
had
in
a
long
time
o
for
a
nut
brown
almost
dead
on
maybe
a
little
bitter
in
the
middle
and
lacking
nose
all
in
all
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
makes
me
look
forward
to
fall
dear
sierra
nevada
make
it
year
round
overall
not
much
left
to
say
but
ill
reiterate
that
even
for
a
autumn
beer
it
still
has
a
place
in
the
terrible
heat
of
july
ill
probably
find
myself
getting
it
a
couple
of
more
times
this
season
d
not
bad
another
respectable
performance
from
sierra
nevada
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
a
marvelous
beer
in
an
underrated
and
usually
poorly
done
style
sierra
nevada
presents
a
beer
with
soft
roasted
flavors
while
still
conveying
just
a
pinch
more
of
the
sweet
maltiness
of
midcolored
beers
compared
to
the
often
more
bitter
and
overtly
roasty
porters
and
stouts
a
really
excellent
beer
and
one
thats
great
on
those
cool
crisp
fall
nights
where
you
arent
looking
for
a
huge
imperial
stout
nightcap
but
dont
want
something
light
would
recommend
prost
lampertland
good
flavor
but
the
carbonation
like
most
sierra
nevada
beers
is
a
little
harsh
i
prefer
a
more
smooth
carbonation
poured
to
a
nice
clear
dark
amber
with
slight
head
smell
was
not
overly
hoppy
and
seemed
to
have
a
little
lingering
yeast
smell
thats
all
overall
a
good
quality
american
brown
ale
note
sure
id
want
to
pay
this
much
all
the
time
though
id
like
to
stop
getting
ripped
off
in
australia
so
we
can
actually
enjoy
this
sort
of
stuff
at
a
reasonable
price
ive
had
the
tumbler
before
i
guess
i
just
never
rated
it
the
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
with
creamy
slightly
offwhite
head
which
is
leaving
a
nice
lace
the
smell
has
some
rich
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
nyut
meg
the
taste
has
good
breadybiscuity
foundation
with
bitter
hops
to
balance
the
mouthfeel
was
a
medium
to
light
brown
ale
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
strong
and
detracting
from
teh
taste
overall
its
a
decent
beer
i
cant
believe
ive
passed
this
up
every
year
for
so
long
one
of
the
best
all
around
brown
ales
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
o
overall
it
was
good
but
sierra
nevada
is
far
better
at
making
ipas
and
they
should
invest
their
time
in
that
o
im
not
a
big
brown
ale
drinker
as
the
style
often
leaves
me
feeling
kinda
meh
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
ale
it
was
quaffed
quickly
and
with
gusto
it
had
a
brisker
crisper
lighter
feel
than
other
brown
ales
i
ve
had
and
i
liked
it
perhaps
the
things
most
people
look
for
in
a
brown
were
missing
hence
its
middling
reviews
but
for
me
it
may
have
been
these
very
factors
that
elevated
it
above
others
for
me
in
particular
absolutely
worth
a
try
as
sierra
nevada
has
firmly
established
themselves
as
a
reliable
brewer
of
great
craft
ales
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
nutty
some
hops
taste
is
malts
nuts
some
hops
a
bit
of
caramel
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
a
more
flavorful
brown
ale
but
within
the
style
guidelines
which
seem
to
consist
of
do
no
harm
a
very
gently
malty
experience
from
the
22
oz
bottle
great
taste
and
color
a
worth
while
try
for
sure
i
found
this
at
kroger
of
all
places
in
the
make
your
own
6
pack
section
a
must
add
to
that
6
pack
this
is
a
shinning
example
of
an
autum
beer
overall
not
a
bad
brown
ale
at
all
yet
i
dont
think
i
could
session
more
than
one
quite
a
good
staple
for
this
above
average
company
o
decent
brown
ale
smells
better
than
it
tastes
a
mildly
hoppy
and
plain
brown
ale
not
as
much
toastiness
and
nuttiness
as
im
used
to
o
another
great
sierra
nevada
brew
its
not
super
heavy
or
robust
but
it
is
a
perfect
option
for
throwing
back
a
few
while
watching
a
football
game
on
a
fall
day
onot
the
best
brown
ale
not
bad
but
seems
lacking
when
compared
to
other
commerical
examples
that
have
more
intense
flavors
overall
a
tasty
brew
being
rather
crisp
for
a
brown
beer
without
being
overly
sweet
and
yet
still
maintaining
some
nice
roasty
and
cocoa
flavor
overall
an
excellent
brown
ale
like
autumn
in
a
bottle
cant
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
get
around
to
trying
it
o
has
everything
a
great
fall
beer
should
perfect
brew
for
kicking
back
after
a
day
of
raking
leaves
or
sipping
by
a
backyard
firepit
tastes
like
fall
o
just
a
solid
american
brown
by
sn
not
going
to
standout
among
the
craft
varieties
of
the
style
but
uts
accessibility
and
quality
make
this
a
nice
goto
beer
in
the
fall
overall
solid
brown
ale
from
sierra
nevada
nothing
special
but
pretty
good
overall
very
drinkable
enjoyable
brew
not
overly
aromatic
or
flavorful
but
nice
and
refreshing
perfect
for
easy
drinking
there
are
better
browns
out
there
pours
a
beautiful
rich
caramel
color
with
a
nice
head
the
head
takes
a
bit
to
dissipate
and
leaves
nice
lacing
rich
malty
flavors
dominate
some
nice
light
hopping
balances
the
considerable
sweetness
of
the
malt
a
feelgood
brew
for
when
the
weather
starts
to
turn
colder
personal
rate
3
5
sierra
nevada
never
fails
to
impress
me
and
this
is
certainly
no
exception
a
very
solid
brown
ale
with
a
great
nutty
flavor
that
does
nothing
but
hit
the
mark
at
5
5
abv
this
beer
is
drinkable
as
can
be
chalk
this
one
up
as
a
victory
some
soapy
and
off
flavors
on
the
finish
from
time
to
time
on
certain
bottles
ive
noticed
such
as
a
soapiness
or
too
much
noticeable
alcohol
could
be
quality
of
the
brewing
process
diminishing
since
i
remember
it
being
much
better
last
year
but
still
a
very
good
fall
beer
o
good
brown
ale
the
depth
of
this
brewery
continues
to
amaze
me
while
they
are
best
known
for
their
fresh
hoppy
profiles
tumbler
provides
are
maltier
one
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
to
balance
its
a
smooth
foamy
brown
biscuity
malts
are
in
the
foreground
with
a
trace
of
nuts
a
wonderful
autumn
seasonal
an
easy
drinking
brown
that
could
also
act
as
a
transition
beer
for
those
just
starting
to
explore
outside
of
newcastle
this
easy
going
brew
would
be
a
great
beer
to
share
with
friends
who
shy
away
from
crazy
beers
that
might
scare
them
away
this
is
similar
to
but
much
better
than
newcastle
in
that
regard
a
beer
that
i
often
recommend
to
people
who
want
to
try
something
better
than
light
lager
crap
overall
this
one
is
a
readily
available
seasonal
brown
ale
at
a
good
price
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
and
this
one
is
available
i
will
not
hesitate
to
pick
it
up
o
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
it
has
a
flavor
that
makes
me
think
of
the
fall
and
went
really
well
on
a
chilly
fall
afternoon
just
before
thanksgiving
i
think
this
could
be
a
decent
fall
session
beer
and
i
would
think
a
nice
tailgating
beer
not
sure
why
its
considered
a
seasonal
but
i
dont
mind
it
good
enough
to
be
enjoyed
yearround
o
a
solid
brown
a
perfectly
balanced
session
brown
but
i
still
want
a
bit
more
malt
depth
they
could
cram
more
malt
flavor
in
there
and
still
keep
the
abv
or
even
lower
it
this
beer
was
better
ontap
back
in
october
at
the
bear
slightly
muted
flavors
suggest
oxidation
which
is
pretty
likely
given
that
this
was
bottled
over
four
months
ago
nevertheless
a
solid
and
drinkable
offering
3
5
o
nice
little
beer
above
average
overall
a
nice
offering
from
sierra
nevada
loving
this
beer
for
autumn
o
this
is
a
good
brown
fitting
for
crisp
autumn
nights
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
immensely
it
will
definitely
be
a
goto
beer
for
the
autumn
season
for
me
final
thoughts
i
picked
this
one
up
as
part
of
a
make
your
own
six
pack
and
im
not
disappointed
i
would
however
be
disappointed
if
i
had
purchased
an
entire
sixer
of
tumbler
its
a
little
on
the
watery
side
and
not
quite
as
robust
as
i
like
my
abas
to
be
its
ideal
for
someone
who
is
new
to
craft
beer
and
fears
dark
beers
i
suppose
would
i
drink
it
again
its
unlikely
m
thin
body
with
overzealous
carbonation
clean
dry
finish
presentation
packaged
in
a
short
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
o
the
freshly
roasted
and
smoked
malt
gives
this
a
nice
seasonal
twist
i
particularly
like
that
this
isnt
all
that
sweet
as
some
browns
can
be
overallperfect
autumn
seasonal
every
time
i
sipped
it
i
looked
outside
and
saw
a
crisp
cool
fall
evening
with
multicolored
leaves
surrounding
the
area
drinking
this
beer
brought
intense
feelings
of
nostalgia
i
eventually
stepped
out
onto
my
patio
and
i
could
smell
wood
burning
stoves
filling
the
autumn
air
great
beer
and
very
sessionable
throw
back
a
couple
i
think
this
beer
should
be
available
throughout
the
winter
too
it
is
not
just
a
great
brew
to
sip
while
watching
th
leaves
change
it
is
a
great
brew
to
sip
on
a
cold
winters
eve
watching
the
snow
fall
if
snow
will
ever
fall
in
the
mountain
west
i
think
global
warming
is
upon
us
my
friends
the
beer
is
copper
to
auburn
in
color
with
a
quarter
inh
of
thick
foamy
beige
head
the
aroma
offers
caramels
malt
squash
light
spice
maybe
a
hint
of
cinnamon
andor
nutmeg
the
flavor
is
ok
with
some
lightly
toasted
brown
bread
notes
mild
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
was
ok
this
beer
pours
a
nice
mahogany
color
not
quite
opaque
with
a
one
inch
head
that
lingers
and
excellent
lacing
smell
is
molasses
honey
coffee
and
charcoal
mouthfeel
is
about
perfect
for
this
style
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
can
sierra
nevada
produce
a
bad
beer
ive
yet
to
have
one
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
colored
head
that
laces
down
the
glass
a
nice
sweet
and
roasted
malt
aroma
sweet
malt
up
front
with
bit
of
hop
and
then
the
toasted
malt
flavor
kicks
in
and
gives
it
a
little
depth
it
finishes
sweet
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
a
lingering
roasted
flavor
the
beer
is
light
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
brown
ale
just
enough
roasted
flavor
and
bitterness
to
counter
the
sweetness
o
an
excellent
beer
crisp
and
suitable
for
fall
will
go
for
this
one
again
one
of
my
favorites
from
sierra
nevada
o
for
a
fall
seasonal
this
is
a
really
pleasant
clean
session
beer
which
i
can
see
myself
drinking
more
then
just
a
few
the
quality
is
great
on
this
brew
and
the
price
can
not
be
beat
hats
off
the
sn
for
so
many
great
enjoyable
brews
and
another
great
fall
seasonal
cheers
o
a
decent
brown
ale
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
bland
and
onedimensional
most
likely
not
a
rebuy
overall
4
0
a
satisfying
beer
that
would
be
excellent
as
a
session
beer
great
on
its
own
but
would
go
well
with
food
and
crudites
thats
right
i
typed
crudites
regardless
this
is
one
of
the
few
mego
micro
seasonals
that
is
worth
picking
up
every
time
it
comes
out
overall
an
enjoyable
rendition
of
a
style
thats
never
been
a
personal
favorite
definitely
a
nice
complement
to
falling
leaves
dropping
temps
and
sunday
afternoon
football
pours
a
nice
medium
brown
with
some
white
head
and
little
bit
of
lacing
aroma
has
a
very
slight
hop
bitterness
but
very
balanced
compared
to
some
other
sierra
nevada
offerings
many
of
the
toasted
to
mid
roasted
malts
starts
to
come
out
in
the
aroma
but
only
after
a
few
hefty
sniffs
taste
has
hints
of
biscuit
caramel
then
to
a
lighter
chocolate
feel
is
nice
and
crisp
with
a
nice
balance
that
would
taste
great
on
a
colder
night
toasty
malt
taste
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
very
tasty
beer
hits
a
very
great
balance
without
being
overly
malty
or
hoppy
o
this
is
what
fall
tastes
like
this
is
now
my
official
fall
go
to
beer
its
extremely
drinkable
and
and
just
the
right
roasty
flavor
and
in
the
mist
of
all
the
esbs
and
pumpkin
beers
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
style
for
the
season
go
out
and
get
a
12
pk
this
stuff
is
fall
in
a
bottle
overall
very
good
fall
seasonal
from
sierra
nevada
will
buy
more
o
a
fantastic
fall
treat
that
is
bready
bittersweet
roasty
and
nutty
i
would
prefer
a
thicker
mouthfeel
but
overall
i
have
no
real
complaints
i
like
the
fact
that
it
isnt
overly
boozy
and
not
burnt
another
delicious
offering
from
sn
o
this
was
a
very
pleasing
high
quality
beer
nothing
is
wild
or
extreme
in
this
one
and
it
is
not
meant
to
be
wild
or
extreme
this
is
a
high
quality
and
baseline
beer
to
use
when
thinking
about
wild
and
extreme
beers
this
beer
has
a
pleasing
balance
of
the
various
flavors
of
dark
roasted
barley
which
results
in
a
satisfying
balance
of
malted
sweetness
and
toasted
grain
chocolate
and
coffee
bitterness
o
love
having
another
good
brown
ale
available
at
a
decent
price
even
if
it
is
only
in
the
fall
i
think
the
brown
ale
style
is
a
little
looked
over
and
im
happy
to
see
a
major
producer
make
one
that
will
appeal
even
to
the
hop
heads
good
work
sierra
o
while
there
are
other
brown
ales
that
i
enjoy
more
this
ones
an
easy
drinker
and
quite
nice
i
expect
nothing
less
from
sierra
nevada
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
rich
chestnut
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
clinging
offwhite
color
aromas
of
campfire
hazelnut
coffee
and
roasted
nut
smells
very
autumn
camping
right
off
the
bat
flavors
are
rich
and
malty
but
balance
is
maintained
by
the
light
carbonated
body
heavily
roasted
with
a
hint
of
the
campfire
charcoal
the
nutty
blend
is
sweet
and
slightly
dark
at
the
same
time
overall
this
comes
off
slightly
bitter
from
all
the
roasting
and
firey
characteristics
but
the
deep
rich
sweetness
balances
very
smoothly
rich
roasty
aftertaste
with
a
slight
smokey
linger
transitioning
into
the
clean
smooth
finish
overall
quality
ingredients
combined
with
flawless
execution
the
trademarks
of
sierra
nevada
it
is
a
little
light
for
my
tastes
but
there
is
still
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
it
i
am
not
sure
i
would
grab
this
again
but
that
is
only
because
i
prefer
a
little
more
punch
from
my
beers
this
time
of
year
overall
a
great
brown
ale
and
a
great
fall
seasonal
definitely
love
the
smokiness
in
it
its
subtle
so
it
doesnt
dominate
but
its
always
there
definitely
a
beer
ill
be
having
again
and
again
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
beautiful
thick
cream
colored
head
scents
of
roasted
malts
caramel
nut
and
a
hint
of
apple
taste
is
of
slightly
bitter
roasted
malt
sourdough
and
it
has
a
beautiful
nutty
aftertaste
i
think
the
smooth
aftertaste
that
is
reminiscent
of
walnuts
and
peanuts
is
the
most
redeeming
aspect
of
this
brew
relatively
thick
mouthfeel
for
a
brown
ale
overall
pleasant
this
beer
definitely
smells
like
fall
though
the
taste
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
the
beer
pours
a
pretty
amber
brown
like
light
grade
maple
syrup
the
head
is
big
fluffy
and
smooth
with
a
nice
light
tan
coloring
and
it
lasts
for
a
little
while
at
a
fingers
width
leaving
sticky
lacing
splotches
behind
the
beer
smells
strongly
of
nutty
roasted
malts
hints
of
roasting
bread
earthy
hops
and
bready
yeast
can
also
be
found
in
the
nose
there
is
also
a
phenomenal
whiff
of
decaying
leaves
which
reminds
me
so
heavily
of
fall
and
my
childhood
that
it
sends
shivers
of
nostalgia
through
me
the
beer
tastes
nicely
sweet
and
nutty
with
nice
roasted
notes
and
hints
of
nut
bread
and
earthy
hops
and
leaves
this
beer
tastes
of
the
fall
it
is
cool
and
crisp
yet
warming
and
sweet
slight
candied
notes
reminiscent
of
maple
syrup
are
also
present
on
the
tongue
the
beer
opens
with
nutty
sweet
malt
and
then
transitions
into
roasted
bread
before
the
taste
closes
down
into
a
roasted
nut
aftertaste
with
slight
coffee
hints
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
prickly
with
the
carbonation
but
the
beer
is
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
with
a
nice
light
chewiness
to
it
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
seasonal
brew
and
a
wonderful
autumn
brown
that
stylistically
echoes
the
season
in
taste
and
smell
another
great
offering
from
sierra
nevada
and
definitely
worthy
of
a
taste
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
with
decent
mix
of
bitter
sweet
and
roasted
flavors
surprisingly
hop
forward
with
some
dry
bitterness
that
lingers
throughout
slightly
overpowering
the
malt
notes
grassy
and
resinous
with
a
floral
pine
presence
thats
countered
by
lightly
smoked
malt
toffee
caramel
and
hazelnut
theres
a
decent
amount
of
sweetness
and
interesting
malt
flavors
but
the
hop
presence
is
too
aggressive
for
the
style
still
its
an
enjoyable
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
a
really
nice
brown
ale
i
wasnt
convinced
after
the
aroma
but
the
taste
is
great
i
love
the
unique
touch
of
chocolate
smoke
and
citrus
and
pine
hops
the
creamy
mouthfeel
is
also
a
plus
sierra
nevada
is
right
this
is
perfect
for
an
autumn
afternoon
raisin
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
slight
chill
haze
poured
with
a
short
beige
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
sweet
lightly
roasted
malt
aromas
with
floral
notes
and
a
hint
of
nuts
dense
rich
carbonation
provides
a
chewy
fuller
body
feel
roasted
malt
flavor
up
front
with
hints
of
roasted
coffee
in
the
background
tangy
floral
hop
bite
in
the
middle
that
accentuates
the
coffee
notes
toward
the
end
finishes
clean
and
dry
with
a
light
lingering
coffeelike
bitterness
roastier
hoppier
and
less
sweet
than
the
typical
brown
ale
sierra
nevada
comes
through
once
again
poured
a
half
inch
head
which
dissapated
to
a
ring
nice
lacing
the
nose
was
of
roasted
malts
dark
fruits
which
made
its
presence
as
it
warmed
toe
tongue
is
roasty
malty
with
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
backbone
overall
a
decent
brew
which
ive
had
on
several
ocassions
very
enjoyable
poured
from
bottle
into
snifter
i
sampled
this
beer
along
with
two
other
similar
choices
shock
top
pumpkin
wheat
and
dundee
oktoberfest
and
it
seemed
wholly
average
it
was
dark
brown
in
color
and
tasted
earthy
it
matched
my
average
expectations
i
didnt
expect
much
and
i
didnt
get
much
for
an
autumn
night
or
a
walk
out
candy
huntin
with
the
kiddos
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
a
sip
every
house
or
so
should
do
keep
it
comin
o
a
very
good
american
brown
ale
at
a
very
reasonable
price
a
nice
segue
into
the
winter
beers
to
follow
from
sn
o
a
decent
brown
ale
but
missing
on
a
few
fronts
in
terms
of
being
appropriate
for
the
style
as
well
as
having
a
spark
this
would
be
good
during
the
football
game
but
not
necessarily
for
provking
a
discussion
creates
a
frothy
two
finger
head
on
the
pour
quite
airy
and
thus
dissolves
down
swiftly
deep
tan
in
color
the
lacing
appears
sticky
at
first
but
only
a
few
streaks
persist
very
clear
brown
hued
liquid
with
a
metallic
orange
tint
some
yellowing
around
the
edges
the
bubbles
are
so
tiny
at
first
you
hardly
see
how
many
there
are
while
the
nose
has
a
crisp
mocha
to
cocoa
toast
to
it
along
with
coffee
notes
behind
that
is
sweeter
caramel
nougat
glazed
nuts
and
honey
gains
stiffness
from
surprisingly
strong
lemon
zest
cut
grass
and
dried
flowers
not
much
fruit
more
of
a
slugger
than
a
glider
in
the
mouth
its
mediumbodied
with
a
good
deal
of
fizzy
carbonation
to
assist
in
relieving
its
weight
more
of
the
nuts
roasted
coffee
cocoa
and
general
toastiness
here
with
more
pumpernickel
to
sourdough
bread
notes
the
roast
tends
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
allowing
for
some
toffee
and
butterscotch
the
hops
have
a
bitter
oiliness
to
them
which
is
actually
for
the
better
as
they
create
a
herbal
pucker
at
the
end
and
continue
the
drying
sensations
so
the
mouth
feel
is
not
overly
creamy
wellbalanced
and
sessionable
its
lack
of
decisive
direction
may
be
offputting
to
some
should
prove
a
versatile
food
beer
decent
brew
dont
drink
it
really
cold
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
probably
not
this
year
o
yet
another
great
offering
by
sn
to
me
a
lot
more
unique
and
diverse
than
the
usual
octoberfests
most
breweries
put
out
a
great
option
on
a
cool
fall
night
for
sure
it
feels
slightly
nutty
and
roasty
but
still
light
nothing
lingers
except
the
hint
of
toasted
malt
conclusion
this
is
an
awesome
seasonal
flaws
i
cant
find
anything
major
great
flavor
and
aroma
plenty
well
done
o
this
was
a
great
beer
and
will
become
a
staple
in
my
fall
seasonals
o
not
my
favorite
beer
because
it
leaves
my
mouth
too
dry
it
is
smooth
and
very
wellbalanced
the
brew
poured
with
a
thick
two
finger
tan
head
that
dissipated
pretty
slowly
it
left
a
lot
of
pretty
lacing
on
the
glass
the
body
poured
a
beautiful
deep
brown
with
lots
of
active
visible
carbonation
the
nose
had
a
lot
of
nuttiness
on
itim
going
with
hazelnuts
maybe
even
a
hint
of
maple
although
im
a
total
hop
head
this
smells
like
fall
to
me
on
first
sip
im
impressed
with
how
good
of
a
brown
ale
this
was
it
had
the
nuttiness
that
was
apparent
in
the
nose
coupled
with
sweet
malt
and
then
a
minor
hint
of
bitterness
all
the
flavors
work
together
in
concert
the
body
was
on
the
thinner
side
with
moderate
carbonation
making
it
an
easy
beer
to
throw
down
after
raking
leaves
or
some
other
appropriate
fall
activity
the
finish
was
quick
with
some
bitterness
to
it
albeit
mild
to
me
this
is
a
great
session
beer
for
the
fall
and
i
could
see
drinking
it
while
sitting
by
a
firepit
this
will
definitely
be
a
seasonal
goto
brew
medium
plus
body
with
a
sharp
up
front
effervescence
slight
warming
this
is
like
newcastle
brown
with
a
bit
more
hops
aftertaste
is
a
nutcardboardtoast
blend
with
an
light
medicinal
note
probably
best
described
as
toasted
nut
i
thought
the
appearance
of
this
beer
was
awesome
hard
to
beat
the
flavors
blended
well
for
the
most
part
but
i
thought
there
was
a
bit
too
much
toastiness
to
it
and
it
was
a
bit
dry
beyond
my
preferences
well
integrated
hops
character
malty
malt
bill
roasted
malts
dry
chocolate
a
brown
ale
thats
up
my
alley
a
number
of
american
brown
ales
are
overroasted
for
my
tastes
not
to
mention
overhopped
this
is
well
balanced
while
still
tipped
to
the
american
side
herbal
hops
aroma
comes
through
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
remarkably
smooth
good
beer
oh
and
last
whiff
aroma
note
from
the
wife
lemon
citrusy
amazing
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
flavoring
there
was
a
certain
depth
to
the
malts
that
really
helped
to
lock
in
and
keep
your
interest
the
lightness
of
feel
helped
this
fact
the
nose
however
is
where
we
lost
points
as
it
presented
quite
generically
and
was
rather
uneventful
throughout
the
sitting
overall
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
very
drinkable
and
perfect
for
a
crisp
fall
day
o
this
beer
is
a
little
drier
and
bitterer
than
your
average
brown
ale
which
i
do
appreciate
fairly
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
but
nothing
special
dont
know
if
i
will
be
buying
this
again
though
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
clear
dark
honey
brown
with
a
tall
creamy
tan
head
that
nearly
overflows
there
are
a
lot
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
in
this
beer
the
head
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
it
dissipates
which
occurs
very
slowly
the
aroma
is
nutty
with
some
roasted
barley
malt
the
nutty
and
roasted
malt
flavors
really
come
through
well
in
the
taste
its
mildly
sweet
and
bready
i
can
detect
some
chocolate
as
well
there
are
some
hops
on
the
back
end
that
are
earthy
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
smells
and
tastes
about
the
same
i
get
some
maple
syrup
toasted
hazelnuts
almonds
chestnuts
toasted
bready
malt
and
an
initial
earthy
grassy
hopping
combo
that
ducks
out
of
the
way
of
the
midsip
only
to
rise
up
anew
in
the
finish
pretty
good
if
perhaps
just
10
too
sweet
for
my
balance
preferences

tumbler
was
a
pretty
standard
brown
ale
overall
its
appearance
was
darkish
brown
with
a
slight
tan
head
its
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
its
smell
was
overall
a
solid
maltiness
but
nothing
super
strong
the
taste
was
much
like
the
nose
just
pretty
average
i
was
hoping
for
something
with
a
little
spice
but
maybe
thatll
have
to
wait
for
he
winter
warmer
overall
one
of
my
favorite
fall
seasons
not
an
oktoberfest
or
a
pumpkin
but
still
fits
in
well
great
transition
from
the
light
summer
beers
to
the
darker
winter
ones
o
great
fall
seasonal
great
flavors
and
body
o
nice
to
see
a
fall
seasonal
that
isnt
pumpkin
or
marzen
honestly
this
should
replace
marzens
as
the
fall
style
malty
enough
for
harvest
style
food
and
football
but
not
quite
as
dark
as
the
blizzardfreezing
water
style
brews
robust
portersstoutswinter
warmers
one
of
sn
best
non
hoppy
beers
overall
drinkability
if
sierra
nevada
amped
everything
up
here
this
would
be
great
as
is
it
is
a
good
beer
excellent
brown
ale
one
of
my
autumn
favorites
by
far
i
will
definitely
be
looking
to
get
this
again
when
the
amber
leaves
are
falling
off
the
trees
and
we
are
enjoying
a
little
evening
campfire
i
encourage
you
to
do
the
same
recommended
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
so
good
that
i
just
kept
going
back
to
it
for
a
whiff
inevitably
that
leads
to
high
expectations
for
all
other
aspects
of
the
beer
it
delivers
nice
smooth
flavor
profile
with
a
rounded
tone
to
it
a
lot
of
brown
ales
i
try
tend
to
be
too
fruity
and
vibrant
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
its
even
i
like
this
one
its
rare
that
this
style
does
it
for
me
but
this
beer
delivers
a
pleasure
to
drink
least
favorite
beer
from
sn
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
esp
for
those
who
like
malty
beers
and
to
introduce
to
your
bigbeerco
friends
as
this
one
is
easy
to
take
and
really
delicious
m
medium
bodied
fizzier
than
i
expected
dry
bitter
finish
o
i
love
autumn
beers
and
i
love
sierra
nevada
and
this
one
really
hits
the
spot
for
me
i
can
see
myself
pounding
a
lot
of
these
this
fall
i
bought
a
12pack
of
this
on
a
whim
and
was
disappointed
not
a
fan
o
not
one
of
sns
better
offerings
having
said
that
its
an
immensely
drinkable
brown
ale
that
one
could
find
themselves
drinking
34
of
in
a
sitting
at
least
its
well
priced
in
typical
sn
fashion
average
but
worth
a
try
once
overall
a
good
brew
review
from
102010
notes
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
amber
with
a
moderate
light
tan
head
aroma
of
light
malt
and
hops
a
pleasant
malty
flavor
with
light
toasted
malts
and
caramel
i
thought
i
caught
the
cinder
flavor
similar
to
cinder
cone
in
there
at
one
point
a
nice
low
abv
brown
ale
overall
a
really
nice
brown
bold
and
assertive
a
little
more
hop
than
your
average
brown
but
i
welcome
it
decent
but
not
outstanding
caramel
and
a
touch
of
toffee
hit
the
palate
and
lend
some
sweetness
to
the
proceedings
it
has
a
subtle
roastiness
but
that
aspect
is
restrained
hopping
is
also
reigned
in
though
there
is
still
a
pleasant
level
of
florality
in
the
dryish
finish
though
not
a
complex
bier
in
any
way
tumbler
goes
down
easily
and
could
make
a
good
session
bier
prosit

the
verdict
not
bad
but
not
at
all
great
probably
the
least
impressive
of
the
beers
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
however
ill
definitely
be
trying
it
again
in
the
autumn
as
fresh
i
can
get
it
overall
well
made
beer
not
a
massive
flavour
not
too
sweet
not
too
bitter
could
go
a
few
and
i
dont
normally
say
that
for
sn
pours
a
grocery
bag
brown
with
a
small
khaki
head
fresh
grainy
aroma
like
walking
into
a
brewhouse
some
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
in
there
too
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
thin
body
and
not
enough
robustness
to
interest
me
a
meek
sweetish
bready
beer
with
a
breath
of
smoke
and
a
vanishing
astringent
finish
good
if
consumed
quickly
one
can
enjoy
a
second
round
tumbler
makes
for
a
fine
everyday
beer
very
smooth
and
drinkable
mouthfeel
reliable
and
highly
satisfying
offering
that
doesnt
grate
in
any
way
whatsoever
nice
to
see
a
sessionable
brew
whose
character
isnt
predominantly
derived
from
hops
o
fantastic
brown
ale
i
love
the
chocolate
tons
without
the
coffee
harshness
its
subtle
balanced
and
delicious
plus
it
has
the
signature
creamy
head
that
all
sierras
bottle
conditioned
beers
have
absolutely
love
it
o
one
of
my
favorites
such
a
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
those
fall
leaf
pickup
days
this
is
an
enjoyable
pretty
standard
american
brown
ale
another
good
brew
from
sierra
nevada
the
only
downside
to
this
offering
is
that
it
is
a
seasonal
and
not
offered
year
round
this
is
my
favorite
brown
ale
hands
down
and
is
my
go
to
beer
when
it
is
available
from
the
smell
to
the
taste
to
the
reasonable
price
it
is
gonna
be
hard
to
beat
tumbler
in
any
aspect
highly
recommended
conclusion
this
was
better
a
bit
fresher
i
wish
i
woulda
gotten
around
to
reviewing
it
then
picked
this
up
for
5
99
so
that
they
could
bring
in
celebration
the
regular
price
is
7
99
at
that
price
id
rate
this
about
an
84
or
so
a
solid
b
id
pick
up
once
or
twice
a
season
o
man
this
was
nice
surprisingly
enough
it
was
made
by
sierra
nevada
low
on
what
makes
americanhops
american
far
from
what
sierra
utsually
puts
on
the
market
all
up
fairly
innocuous
well
balanced
and
tasty
but
coulf
be
richer
for
mine
although
this
would
probably
put
it
into
the
porter
category
overall
not
bad
i
thought
it
was
a
great
autumn
beer
a
mild
mouthfeel
with
a
small
spark
of
carbonation
and
medium
body
this
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beverage
but
not
something
thats
amazing
good
on
a
fall
day
and
not
very
offensive
to
beer
novices
but
a
touch
dull
in
the
long
run
worth
a
try
but
probably
one
i
wont
buy
again
overall
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
really
rave
about
in
my
opinion
very
drinkable
but
also
pretty
mild
flavors
o
i
like
some
of
sierra
nevadas
other
offerrings
better
but
this
isnt
bad
by
any
means
its
a
nice
fall
beer
and
i
will
drink
it
again
overall
drinkability
sessionable
not
much
of
a
tasting
beer
near
boring
but
not
quite
d
a
little
blander
than
i
had
expected
especially
after
that
first
whiff
but
a
solid
brown
ale
the
kinds
of
beer
i
look
forward
to
when
the
leaves
begin
to
fall
o
overall
a
favorite
brown
ale
of
mine
id
buy
it
year
round
if
offered
and
ill
be
sure
to
pick
it
up
every
autumn
overall
a
most
satisfying
brown
ale
side
note
awesome
with
some
sweet
potato
fries
and
horseradish
mayo
im
not
a
huge
brown
fan
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
and
i
try
to
keep
style
in
mind
when
rating
overall
this
is
a
nice
latefallearlywinter
beer
when
im
not
quite
in
the
mood
for
a
heavier
stoutporter
or
anything
too
spiced
a
good
showing
by
sierra
nevada
its
hard
to
make
a
distinguished
brown
ale
this
one
may
be
it
has
a
toastedbiscuit
character
that
seperates
it
from
other
brown
ales
just
enough
for
you
to
notice
but
not
too
much
to
block
its
drinkability
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
liked
this
a
more
hoppy
brown
ale
for
a
fall
season
not
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
that
time
of
year
but
still
a
well
crafted
beer
food
pairing
this
would
be
really
good
with
some
hearty
beef
stew
and
a
hunk
of
beer
bread
on
a
brisk
autumn
afternoon
on
the
patio
overall
a
brown
ale
that
had
a
lot
of
flavor
and
an
almost
perfect
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
having
turned
on
to
the
recent
trend
of
hoppy
browns
this
one
shows
how
good
the
other
side
can
be
without
completely
leaving
hops
out
of
course
drink
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
with
some
nice
balance
and
good
roastiness
behind
it
a
little
lacking
in
pop
but
had
a
bit
thin
feel
which
brought
it
down
a
little
for
me
overall
it
seems
like
this
is
an
english
brown
ale
plenty
of
malt
not
big
on
hop
bitterness
another
well
done
sierra
nevada
brew
overall
a
pretty
solid
brown
ale
the
hoppiest
of
any
of
the
few
browns
ive
had
ooverall
this
is
a
good
fall
seasonal
smooth
drinking
and
comforting
on
those
cold
fall
nights
mouthfeel
light
bodied
smooth
texture
o
for
a
brown
ale
this
makes
a
statement
more
hops
then
most
and
stronger
then
some
but
easy
drinking
due
to
the
crisp
light
feel
that
many
brown
ales
impart
i
really
like
this
beer
and
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
more
of
it
this
fall
very
wellsuited
to
the
season
this
is
one
of
the
tastier
brown
ales
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
kudos
to
sn
everything
about
it
is
solid
and
its
so
smooth
and
balanced
will
definitely
be
drinking
more
of
this
o
a
solid
choice
a
good
malt
profile
would
recommend
to
those
who
like
a
moderate
hoppy
presence
in
a
brown
garnet
brown
in
color
with
striking
ruby
hues
in
the
light
pour
produces
a
creamy
and
fluffy
head
almost
looks
like
it
was
poured
from
a
nitro
tap
but
there
is
no
lacing
to
be
found
hints
of
peaty
smoke
earthy
hops
and
yeast
along
with
light
fruity
esters
overall
well
balanced
and
flavorful
but
the
complexity
falls
short
as
the
smokey
notes
take
over
the
beer
creamy
and
thin
and
smooth
on
the
palate
decent
brown
ale
but
not
topnotch
opretty
enjoyable
for
my
first
brown
ale
im
not
sure
what
other
people
see
in
this
beer
browns
are
definitely
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
didnt
have
much
redeeming
qualities
a
rare
miss
from
sierra
nevada
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
but
too
rough
around
the
edges
not
in
my
top
10
for
the
style
o
its
fine
like
the
high
amount
of
hops
dislike
the
high
amount
of
carbination
p
s
had
one
tonight
with
roasted
chickenfingerling
potato
and
gravey
the
flavors
of
the
beer
really
came
into
play
while
drank
with
the
roast
dinner
reveiw
was
based
on
a
clean
palate
liked
it
better
than
i
thought
i
would
very
nice
blend
easy
drinking
will
have
some
every
fall
from
now
on
lively
carbonation
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
very
easy
drinking
not
a
big
flavored
beer
by
any
means
just
a
pleasant
and
refreshing
brown
ale
toasty
caramel
malt
and
very
mild
smoke
were
the
predominant
characteristics
for
me
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
through
this
a
quite
enjoyable
brown
ale
and
enjoyed
sipping
my
way
through
both
the
first
and
the
second
one
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
beer
is
a
good
solid
brown
that
well
made
quite
good
even
if
not
among
the
best
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
an
evening
of
dinner
and
conversation
with
friends
this
a
fantastic
fall
beer
and
the
price
is
fantastic
i
will
definitely
buy
more
of
this
beer
nice
and
easy
to
drink
sierra
nevada
got
it
right
again
pretty
good
beer
overall
smooth
and
roasty
rules
the
day
a
really
good
brown
ale
i
am
glad
i
had
picked
it
up
picked
this
up
at
the
mondial
bier
fest
in
strasbourg
france
clear
mahogany
pour
with
one
finger
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
very
nutty
toasty
malty
nose
with
hints
of
caramel
and
just
a
touch
of
coffee
and
metal
roasty
malts
dominate
the
taste
along
with
an
earthy
nuttiness
with
hints
of
chocolate
toffee
caramel
and
just
a
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
metal
very
nice
balance
between
the
bitter
hops
and
sweet
malt
too
many
times
these
types
of
beers
are
sickly
sweet
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
dry
stoutlike
finish
another
great
beer
from
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
breweries
d
on
the
hoppy
side
but
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
brown
ale
ofantastic
beer
perfect
for
the
fall
isnt
too
big
that
you
cant
have
a
few
but
still
lots
of
flavor
so
that
it
remains
delicious
each
glass
well
crafted
o
good
for
the
style
and
good
to
me
d
good
beer
easy
to
drink
i
really
thought
that
this
was
a
good
beer
brewers
could
have
done
more
though
to
separate
themselves
from
the
usual
brown
nut
ale
taste
o
tasty
but
not
particularly
memorable
overall
a
very
good
nut
brown
ale
the
hops
and
roasted
malt
are
in
perfect
balance
very
drinkable
a
very
nice
and
sessionable
brown
ale
great
fall
beer
a
nice
subtle
sierra
nevada
offering
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
that
i
have
ever
had
look
forward
to
drinking
this
one
every
year
great
flavor
great
smell
i
absolutely
love
a
brown
ale
that
i
can
practically
chew
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
bit
strange
not
as
mellow
as
i
would
expect
pours
a
very
nice
dark
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
very
nice
onefinger
plus
tan
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
sweet
malty
with
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
with
some
very
nice
caramel
notes
medium
body
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
american
brown
ale
oa
bit
astringent
on
the
roast
to
be
my
favorite
brown
but
very
nice
in
colder
weather
o
a
classic
fall
beer
that
never
disappoints
the
flavors
are
clean
and
both
warming
and
refreshing
for
that
fall
transitional
period
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
great
taste
perfect
representation
of
fall
loved
it
edit
made
black
and
tans
sort
of
with
smutty
robust
porters
they
didnt
have
the
classic
bnt
look
but
they
tasted
great
appearance
is
a
dark
translucent
brown
head
is
off
white
small
good
lacing
smells
of
roasted
coffee
and
malts
tiny
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
earthiness
taste
is
coffee
caramel
bread
malty
and
finishes
with
some
crisp
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
yet
gives
some
bite
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
autumn
browns
it
feels
and
looks
like
fall
o
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
an
autumn
brown
ale
but
this
was
really
good
perfect
in
a
mug
and
when
its
cold
outside
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
not
the
best
brown
ive
had
and
certainly
not
the
best
beer
from
this
brewery
o
pretty
good
beer
not
as
good
as
other
browns
but
this
holds
its
own
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
will
probably
pick
up
a
six
pack
next
time
im
at
the
store
o
pretty
good
offering
good
take
on
a
non
marzen
or
pumpkin
fall
beer
o
very
good
beer
its
definitely
falllike
i
wish
it
had
a
touch
more
spice
of
sorts
but
thats
all
pours
a
cherry
chestnut
brown
almost
cola
looking
with
a
1
finger
head
and
minimal
visible
carbonation
slight
coffeetoffee
notes
on
the
nose
sweet
malts
almost
an
extract
type
scent
thrown
in
as
well
sweet
malts
fill
the
palate
slight
nuts
and
toffee
swirl
around
and
hint
of
bittering
from
the
hops
light
on
the
body
easy
to
drink
sweet
and
bitter
overall
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
brown
ale
with
alot
of
character
def
worth
trying
out
o
just
a
nice
clean
tasting
brown
not
overhopped
like
some
american
browns
not
overly
malted
as
well
nice
sessionable
beer
odnot
on
par
with
a
celebration
ale
as
a
seasonal
but
i
think
i
like
it
better
than
their
summer
and
spring
seasonal
solid
good
for
autumn
of
course
served
ice
cold
on
tap
poured
a
glorious
ruddy
amber
topped
with
a
finger
of
thick
white
foam
not
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
as
it
warms
the
flavor
comes
through
but
the
aroma
stays
muted
it
has
a
pleasing
sweet
malt
flavor
very
agreeable
nice
carbonation
great
finish
just
an
allaround
enjoyable
beer
for
me
to
praise
a
brown
ale
it
better
be
good
overall
i
was
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
really
liked
it
at
first
but
by
the
finish
i
didnt
find
it
as
charming
as
i
first
thought
or
as
others
described
not
a
bad
beer
though
but
nothing
special
for
a
brown
ale
overall
another
great
offering
in
the
form
of
a
brown
ale
from
the
sierra
nevada
lineup
i
found
a
new
addition
to
my
autumn
selection
i
took
a
gamble
committing
to
a
16th
keg
without
trying
it
first
but
sierra
nevada
hasnt
failed
me
yet
if
you
like
brown
ales
give
it
a
try
o
a
good
fall
beer
that
has
great
characteristics
that
all
go
together
no
flavor
overpowers
the
others
and
the
medley
of
tastes
flow
into
each
other
well
o
excellent
brown
ale
very
smooth
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
overall
solid
american
brown
ale
great
for
fall
drinking
well
balanced
both
flavor
and
aroma
improve
as
it
warms
up
o
quite
yummy
autumn
ale
malty
goodness
overall
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
definitely
worth
trying
though
there
are
definitely
better
brown
ales
out
there
pours
a
rich
mahogany
color
with
a
sticky
foam
like
head
nice
lacing
and
malt
nose
the
flavor
is
predominantly
coffee
malt
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
excellent
with
finely
crafted
carbonation
this
is
a
terrific
fall
seasonal
without
the
sweetness
that
most
breweries
pump
out
this
time
of
year
more
true
to
the
english
style
browns
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
liked
sierra
to
do
here
but
overall
exceeded
my
expectations
will
definitely
be
picking
up
some
bottles
ogood
for
rainy
fall
days
and
the
cooling
transition
from
summer
to
fall
the
light
body
keeps
it
from
needing
a
coldweather
complement
but
its
strong
roast
and
mild
bitterness
kill
the
chill
o
another
solid
offering
from
sn
i
love
this
brewery
8
99
6er
great
value
here
overall
an
excellent
fall
seasonal
perfect
for
cooler
autumn
weather
really
delivers
in
the
rich
dark
roasted
malt
department
overall
this
beer
is
both
somewhat
light
and
drinkable
yet
layered
and
flavorful
although
there
is
a
varied
flavor
profile
however
each
characteristic
is
a
bit
thin
making
this
somehow
not
as
satisfying
as
it
could
be
overall
its
a
good
beer
i
was
hoping
to
find
something
that
tasted
a
bit
warmer
for
a
brown
ale
the
toastyness
of
the
beer
was
good
but
for
a
brown
ale
this
seemed
a
tad
more
on
the
hoppy
side
o
decent
its
balanced
but
as
a
result
nothing
really
stands
out
to
me
wish
for
more
caramel
brown
sugar
and
almond
notes
in
a
brown
ale
hence
the
grade
i
preferred
this
more
last
year
though
im
sure
its
the
same
recipe
and
my
palate
has
changed
o
this
is
a
really
good
brown
to
which
i
plan
on
returning
really
could
be
more
than
a
seasonal
o
excellent
enh
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
less
carbonation
than
youd
expect
from
the
pour
and
pretty
smooth
overall
a
great
fall
beer
great
for
watching
football
and
relaxing
will
probably
be
picking
up
a
case
of
this
in
the
near
future
o
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
very
sessionable
notes
i
guess
it
was
time
to
try
it
but
did
not
feel
inclined
to
get
into
the
sixer
i
confess
that
im
rarely
enticed
by
an
american
brown
ale
grabbing
the
single
revealed
a
pleasing
and
quality
quaff
one
could
have
it
again
socially
without
much
fanfare
color
is
dark
brown
with
maroon
highlights
when
held
to
light
the
generous
tan
head
is
long
lasting
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
roasted
malts
are
noted
in
the
smell
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
primarily
roasted
malt
caramelly
and
nutty
with
some
herbal
hop
taste
in
the
finish
nicely
balanced
and
a
beer
fitting
for
autumn
a
decent
workhorse
brown
ale
from
sierra
nevada
it
lacks
a
bit
of
a
hop
kick
to
really
make
it
work
though
ooverall
a
really
solid
brown
ale
i
could
absolutley
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
this
is
a
moderately
dark
reddishbrown
ale
transparent
with
a
fizzy
shortlived
head
the
aroma
is
very
inviting
malt
and
nut
earthy
and
slightly
smokey
a
little
toast
and
a
fleeting
touch
of
fruit
some
slight
hop
scents
as
well
the
taste
is
moderate
in
its
intensity
with
a
maltcentric
bend
fairly
low
in
carbonation
and
a
little
lighter
in
body
than
i
would
have
preferred
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
is
a
fairly
good
and
drinkable
beer
but
not
exceptional
or
really
remarkable
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
color
is
deep
deep
mahogany
like
a
dark
ruby
red
head
is
a
oneinch
thick
fluffy
creamy
pillow
of
froth
the
head
dissipates
to
an
even
film
of
bubbles
across
the
top
pretty
decent
sticky
lacing
this
beer
tastes
solid
a
more
richly
flavored
brown
ale
toffee
caramel
and
roasty
malts
are
present
mouthfeel
is
slightly
carbonated
but
really
nice
this
beer
doesnt
feel
watered
down
overall
this
is
a
fine
autumn
beer
its
easily
sessionable
its
along
the
same
lines
as
a
breckenridge
autumn
ale
for
comparison
great
for
a
chilly
evening
id
recommend
trying
this
one
if
you
like
autumn
ales
a
perfectly
clear
amberish
brown
with
a
huge
head
and
chunky
lacing
smell
is
sweet
with
faint
molasses
and
brown
bread
hops
are
evident
with
an
earthy
body
and
mildly
sharp
edge
taste
is
exceptional
rich
malty
body
with
a
clean
earthed
hops
finish
english
style
mineral
undertone
firms
up
the
dryness
while
leaving
a
lovely
toasted
brown
bread
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
butter
and
sweet
mild
molasses
feel
is
crisp
and
lightly
creamy
with
a
lovely
suppleness
to
the
light
medium
weight
this
is
super
drinkable
and
goes
with
pizza
as
well
as
traditional
hearty
fall
fare
a
great
american
brown
stock
up
on
tis
one
o
this
is
a
great
fall
beer
it
is
really
drinkable
and
has
a
wellbalanced
and
subtle
flavor
profile
i
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
single
session
and
be
very
happy
o
a
good
fall
seaonal
brew
the
balance
was
good
and
the
biterness
lingers
on
the
tongue
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
but
i
did
drink
it
pretty
quickly
so
i
must
have
liked
it
o
a
very
solid
brown
ale
and
certainly
a
surprising
treat
wish
i
had
brought
a
bottle
back
with
me
from
my
visit
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
am
just
not
all
the
in
to
brown
ales
o
this
beer
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
and
a
perfect
autumn
beer
it
is
tasty
rich
and
wonderfully
satisfying
o
pretty
good
ale
its
a
nice
change
from
the
watered
down
oktoberfest
fall
selection
worth
a
try
for
sure
o
i
like
this
beer
and
have
had
it
many
times
i
think
this
is
an
extremely
accessible
craft
beer
if
youre
trying
to
get
someone
to
step
outside
their
bmc
comfort
zone
and
discover
what
real
flavor
is
this
could
be
an
excellent
first
step
that
being
said
this
is
also
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
the
more
sophisticated
drinker
put
it
this
way
if
you
love
beer
but
not
everyone
you
know
is
as
enthusiastic
as
you
are
this
is
what
you
should
bring
to
thanksgiving
everyone
will
love
it
including
you
its
not
perfect
but
its
got
something
for
everyone
recommended
too
much
carbonation
it
was
ok
but
not
something
that
ill
be
rushing
out
to
have
again
o
sierra
nevada
makes
some
simple
yet
remarkable
beers
this
one
however
is
just
simple
it
has
good
flavor
sure
but
its
lacking
in
a
few
key
areas
a
pleasant
drink
but
nothing
more
very
good
complexity
but
not
overly
done
overall
a
nice
fall
brown
ale
the
aroma
was
no
where
near
what
i
experienced
for
taste
definitely
the
biggest
difference
ive
experienced
there
nice
autumn
session
beer
and
definiely
a
good
alternative
to
the
flooded
octoberfest
market
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
american
brown
ale
everything
about
this
beer
was
pretty
good
with
nothing
seeming
off
or
out
of
place
about
it
and
the
drinkability
was
really
good
it
just
had
the
right
combination
of
flavor
and
smoothness
that
made
them
go
down
quicker
then
expected
a
six
pack
during
a
nice
fall
bonfire
would
for
sure
hit
the
spot
what
i
like
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
looked
exactly
how
i
would
want
a
brown
ale
to
look
and
the
nice
flavor
was
also
very
noteworthy
if
i
had
to
choose
something
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
it
would
have
to
be
the
aroma
it
was
good
but
the
sweet
dark
fruits
seems
a
little
weird
but
that
really
wasnt
a
big
deal
at
all
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
theres
a
good
chance
i
will
be
getting
another
twelve
pack
before
it
disappears
for
the
year
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
and
if
brown
ales
are
your
thing
then
they
dont
get
much
more
drinkable
then
this
this
beer
makes
my
top
three
brown
ale
list
but
i
still
think
indian
brown
is
my
favorite
this
was
another
good
beer
from
sierra
nevada
every
style
i
try
from
them
always
seem
like
a
good
drinkable
representation
of
the
style
and
this
beer
is
no
different
thanks
for
sending
your
quality
brews
to
michigan
sierra
nevada
o
good
solid
brown
ale
you
dont
get
any
shit
beers
from
these
guys
perfect
for
the
season
pours
a
mahogany
brown
color
ruby
red
when
held
up
to
the
setting
sun
big
creamy
tan
head
that
only
reduces
slightly
as
it
sits
has
a
fantastic
rich
roasted
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
booze
coming
through
as
it
warms
i
think
its
lighter
body
is
a
double
edged
sword
it
doesnt
all
the
way
stand
up
to
the
chilly
wind
outside
because
its
light
in
my
belly
but
at
the
same
time
i
could
put
a
6pack
of
these
away
no
problem
delicious
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
coca
cola
colored
beer
it
poured
a
nice
fluffy
tan
head
that
had
a
great
malty
smell
to
it
the
beer
was
smooth
with
a
slight
caramel
taste
this
is
a
really
great
tasting
beer
and
i
will
certainly
buy
again
tumbler
pours
a
lovely
brown
color
with
a
pillowy
tan
head
the
smell
is
faint
with
notes
of
caramel
the
taste
is
toasty
with
nice
notes
of
caramel
and
grain
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
to
the
point
of
being
silky
there
is
a
nice
roasted
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
o
pretty
tasty
brown
ale
has
a
nice
fruit
component
that
most
do
not
have
and
is
very
easy
drinking
not
my
favorite
brown
but
better
than
most
update
i
sampled
the
2014
version
in
the
fall
variety
pack
and
thought
it
was
slightly
less
hearty
and
rich
than
previous
versions
im
not
sure
if
this
is
due
to
a
slight
change
in
the
recipe
or
a
cloudy
memory
on
my
part
nevertheless
i
thought
it
was
relevant
to
mention
it
as
an
addendum
drinkability
the
taste
makes
up
for
everything
the
smell
lacks
it
is
very
bold
and
aggressive
i
am
really
impressed
and
eager
to
have
another
d
aside
from
the
slightly
more
bitter
taste
than
i
would
like
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
enjoyable
one
of
my
favorite
browns
pick
this
up
every
fall
if
you
can
pours
with
moderate
turbidity
as
a
deep
copper
brown
gives
way
to
a
thick
three
finger
almond
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
wonderful
lacing
plastered
all
over
the
walls
of
the
glass
toasty
almonds
and
caramel
on
the
nose
very
faint
hop
aromas
simple
but
delightful
the
flavor
is
malty
and
nutty
toasted
almonds
again
toffee
caramel
cocoa
and
milk
chocolate
linger
in
the
shadows
very
nice
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
balanced
velvety
and
slightly
sweet
very
sessionable
this
beer
is
not
complex
just
an
excellent
example
of
what
a
brown
should
be
sometimes
its
nice
to
drink
something
simple
and
just
plain
good
as
much
as
i
really
like
most
from
sierra
nevada
this
was
not
one
of
them
for
me
do
classic
sierra
nevada
easy
to
find
cheap
and
worth
a
try
cheers
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
fall
at
an
affordable
price
not
sure
ill
buy
it
again
this
year
but
ill
probably
look
for
it
again
next
year
o
great
drinkability
nice
autumnfall
beer
sierra
nevada
rarely
disappoints
othis
is
good
real
good
i
remember
having
this
a
long
time
ago
and
feeling
indifferent
about
it
but
this
time
it
just
hit
the
spot
this
so
easy
to
drink
im
very
proud
of
my
self
for
going
with
the
6pack
although
id
love
to
know
what
sierra
nevada
could
come
up
with
for
a
pumpkin
beer
or
oktoberfest
but
i
appreciate
the
originality
with
this
one
good
job
sn
dark
but
not
opaque
chestnut
brown
with
a
nice
nutty
smell
small
offwhite
head
with
a
surprising
amount
of
lacing
caramel
toasted
nuts
some
coffee
some
pine
hops
and
a
drying
character
on
the
back
of
the
tonguealmost
too
drying
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
especially
with
the
right
food
pairing
d
a
very
solid
very
respectable
brown
ale
all
the
parts
work
together
to
create
a
wonderful
harmony
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
an
excellent
fall
seasonal
offering
o
very
enjoyable
to
look
at
and
taste
will
definitely
have
more
a
good
stab
at
the
style
and
worth
trying
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
but
definitely
give
it
a
shot
if
you
see
it
smells
of
three
heavy
hitters
coffee
cocoa
and
caramel
bounces
off
the
tongue
reminiscent
of
the
smell
cocoa
dark
burnt
malts
smoothly
glides
with
a
medium
body
just
a
hint
of
sweet
marshmallow
reminds
one
its
autumn
again
overall
a
solid
seasonal
one
that
makes
me
very
excited
for
the
colder
seasons
as
those
are
just
as
good
here
in
co
as
are
the
warm
ones
very
good
give
it
a
go
overall
what
a
nicely
balanced
and
complex
brown
ale
complex
with
all
of
the
flavors
playing
equal
parts
not
overly
sweet
at
all
very
thirst
quenching
enjoying
my
first
one
during
monday
night
football
you
should
too
highly
recommend
and
a
very
good
representative
of
the
style
overall
impression
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
i
would
categorize
this
one
as
an
english
brown
but
no
worries
sierra
nevada
is
known
for
their
hops
and
strength
this
one
i
just
had
to
try
probably
wont
be
going
back
to
it
but
wouldnt
pursaude
anyone
to
not
to
try
it
o
this
one
is
pretty
good
picked
it
up
with
a
mix
a
six
and
its
pretty
good
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
not
too
filling
mild
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
autumn
beer
very
easy
to
throw
back
a
few
o
yet
another
exceptional
beer
from
our
good
friends
at
sierra
nevada
now
i
want
a
celebration
ale
overall
an
incredible
brown
ale
find
some
and
drink
it
o
maybe
i
got
an
old
one
it
was
picked
up
as
a
single
its
worth
trying
overall
nice
brown
ale
poured
a
3
beige
head
clear
dark
burnt
umber
brown
body
smells
very
mildly
of
malt
and
even
after
warmed
not
much
smell
taste
is
also
very
mild
mainly
malt
and
with
some
imagination
the
slightest
hint
of
cocoa
butter
but
all
in
all
mild
not
hoppy
although
a
decent
drinkable
beer
i
just
dont
find
anything
too
remarkable
about
it
poured
from
the
classic
stubby
sn
bottle
mahogany
brown
color
with
copper
highlights
thick
head
of
with
a
nice
lacing
faint
aroma
of
toasted
malt
with
hints
of
coffee
and
smoke
flavors
of
toasted
medium
dark
malts
caramel
and
brown
sugar
mild
bitterness
firm
mouthfeel
full
and
creamy
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
what
a
great
beer
for
a
fall
football
tailgating
weekend
go
tigers
o
for
a
seasonal
brown
ale
this
is
quite
tasty
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
many
autumn
offerings
and
this
is
certainly
abovepar
that
being
said
when
judged
independent
of
its
season
this
beer
is
nothing
too
special
poured
a
nice
rich
brown
color
with
a
good
taupe
head
that
hangs
around
for
awhile
nice
aromas
of
roasted
nuts
good
milk
chocolate
and
maybe
a
little
lightly
roasted
malt
somewhat
dry
on
the
palate
with
some
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
a
late
bitterness
pretty
solid
really
a
let
down
on
tap
a
perfect
beer
to
kick
off
fall
especially
when
you
tire
of
festbieroctoberfest
offerings
color
is
deep
clear
reddishbrown
with
a
tan
thick
head
on
top
that
sticks
around
foamy
rich
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
nutty
flavors
mild
malt
balanced
by
mellow
hops
and
some
raisin
flavored
sweetness
good
body
not
an
overly
thick
mouthfeel
but
this
is
a
rich
beer
overall
the
alcohol
kicks
a
bit
but
this
is
cool
weather
warmer
and
it
fills
that
role
perfectly
quite
drinkable
for
a
heavier
style
beer
recommended
highly
overall
drinkability
very
drinkable
gone
in
almost
no
time
at
all
a
nice
balanced
brown
ale
with
strong
hop
and
malt
flavors
a
very
nice
fall
offering
and
i
could
easily
have
another
one
i
like
the
combination
of
malt
and
hops
with
this
one
well
balanced
and
the
two
compliment
each
other
well
soft
and
creamy
pleasant
nose
and
its
beer
whats
not
to
like
overall
im
going
to
have
to
get
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
its
a
good
beer
for
the
fall
so
they
didnt
even
miss
on
the
name
in
the
end
a
very
satisfying
brew
i
give
a
schlitz
for
tumbler
notes
beautiful
looking
very
tasty
beer
a
nice
brown
ale
and
a
real
marker
into
the
world
of
cooler
weather
and
darker
beers
nice
a
keeper
compared
to
long
trails
harvest
ale
my
other
favorite
brown
ale
this
is
the
true
winner
a
fall
classic
well
done
sierra
nevada
overall
good
beer
very
drinkable
not
to
bitter
and
not
too
sweet
good
balanced
beer
i
like
this
beer
and
would
definitely
buy
this
again
another
sierra
nevada
quality
beer
overallsierra
nevada
just
does
it
right
impressive
on
so
many
levels
every
beer
they
put
out
is
solid
while
other
breweries
are
brewing
beers
w
bacon
quadrupal
ipas
stouts
aged
in
tequilla
sierra
nevada
is
just
making
quality
beer
after
quality
beer
well
done
o
a
nice
aba
and
seasonal
brew
overall
i
would
say
this
is
probably
the
barometer
for
an
american
brown
terrific
malt
backbone
and
just
a
kiss
of
hops
in
there
to
differentiate
it
from
its
english
counterpart
will
definitely
be
getting
more
of
this
before
the
season
is
over
aside
from
the
hemisphere
beers
that
sn
does
this
is
right
up
there
with
my
favorites
o
dissapointing
i
really
wanted
another
cheap
goto
brown
this
failed
to
much
hop
bitterness
for
my
brown
tastes
o
way
too
watery
this
beer
was
kind
of
a
mess
did
not
blend
together
well
drinkable
sure
a
disappointment
from
sierra
nevada
though
definitely
solid
brown
ale
that
id
like
to
try
from
the
tap
o
a
nice
rich
sweet
beer
the
overall
impression
is
not
one
of
cloying
sweetness
but
actually
balance
with
the
the
hops
and
the
dry
finish
another
solid
offering
from
sierra
nevada
it
came
in
a
brown
bottle
it
gave
a
two
finger
rootbeer
like
head
the
color
is
dark
brown
with
inviting
red
highlights
i
could
see
almost
nothing
through
the
mug
there
was
some
transluscence
but
the
beer
borders
on
the
opaque
the
head
maintained
for
a
few
minutes
more
then
half
its
initial
thickness
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
bubling
apparent
it
smells
hoppy
and
yeasty
to
me
the
malty
sweetness
is
quite
evident
without
beeing
overpowering
the
thickness
is
moderate
there
is
light
to
moderate
short
bunchylined
lacing
there
is
a
nutty
chocalatey
taste
after
becoming
acclimatized
to
more
hoppy
beers
i
can
tell
the
hops
are
there
but
the
bitterness
is
more
ballanced
it
seems
well
buit
there
is
a
pleasant
stickiness
left
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
i
could
drink
another
and
would
if
i
could
right
now
im
not
used
to
drinking
brown
ales
so
this
is
sort
of
an
introduction
for
me
this
stuff
is
great
very
drinkable
and
an
excellent
example
of
a
warming
fall
beer
nose
of
malt
and
co2
flavor
is
malty
with
slight
hop
bitterness
twinge
the
big
selling
point
for
this
beer
has
to
be
the
toasty
brown
flavor
it
brings
forward
without
adding
a
heavy
finish
good
gateway
beer
for
your
non
beer
drinker
friends
and
nice
for
kicking
back
a
few
pints
certainly
not
an
incredible
piece
of
beer
artistry
though
good
offering
from
sierra
nevada
o
very
drinkable
smooth
great
tasting
brown
ale
perfect
mix
of
malt
and
sweetness
i
liked
this
one
a
bit
more
than
a
overall
a
fantastic
fall
seasonal
for
a
standard
beer
category
sierra
nevada
does
a
great
job
staying
within
guidelines
while
not
compromising
on
flavor
definitely
find
this
beer
if
you
like
more
maltforward
brown
ales
smooth
drinkable
and
relaxed
great
for
autumn
afternoons
and
evenings
overall
another
successful
beer
from
sn
really
enjoyed
it
cheers
could
easily
have
a
few
good
example
of
the
style
o
great
fall
offering
from
sierra
finish
makes
it
a
solid
beer
this
brew
pours
out
a
mediumdark
color
thats
not
quite
as
dark
as
most
browns
and
it
has
a
nice
head
on
it
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
it
has
a
pleasant
malty
smell
thats
got
light
chocolate
and
nutty
tones
to
it
its
not
a
heavy
brown
ale
tumbler
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
a
thick
and
malty
beverage
thats
very
breadlike
without
a
whole
lot
of
bite
its
a
great
beer
for
the
fall
season
overall
not
my
favorite
style
by
far
but
another
winner
from
sn
a
great
beer
o
i
really
enjoy
this
its
a
perfect
addition
to
the
sn
seasonal
release
schedule
i
personally
dont
like
pumpkin
or
oktoberfest
beers
so
this
fits
the
bill
as
a
great
replacement
for
fall
dr
its
cheap
but
forgettable
leave
this
for
committed
fans
of
the
style
im
unimpressed
o
fantastic
brown
ale
one
of
my
favorite
fall
seasonals
12
oz

dark
amber
with
an
offwhite
long
lasting
thick

through
as
the
beer
warms
up

smooth

toasted
malt
herbal
spicy
hops
and
dark
fruit
fill
the
mouth
the
finish
is
long
hoppy
and
dry
tasty
session
brew
overall
this
is
a
great
aba
and
i
would
purchase
it
again
overall
not
too
bad
for
a
brown
ale
has
a
deep
bronze
color
with
a
beige
head
dissipates
at
moderate
speed
leaving
excellent
lacing
the
nose
consists
primarily
of
nuts
some
caramel
and
leather
the
taste
is
very
nutty
and
toasty
some
wood
leather
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
fruity
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
hearty
without
being
sticky
or
chewy
a
solid
brown
ale
especially
enjoyable
in
fall
or
winter
dark
brown
but
translucent
small
amount
of
big
bubbly
head
roasted
malt
some
copper
bitterness
slightly
earthynutty
somewhat
of
an
earthy

more
of

bready

for
the
flavor
with
a
earthy
nut
finish
crisp
but
also
roasted
and
earthy
bitter
for
the
finish
malts
dominate
but
sierra
busts
out
some
hop
flavors
for
this
one
overall
a
very
good
fallwinter
brew
that
i
would
seek
out
again
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
sometime
a
decent
simple
incredibly
easy
drinking
brown
ale
i
prefer
sierra
nevadas
previously
brewed
now
retired
brown
ale
very
good
brown
ale
and
i
dont
usually
care
for
the
style
pours
a
dark
chocolaty
brown
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
retains
as
a
thin
layer
smells
of
dark
roasted
malts
nutty
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
resiny
hops
kind
of
reminds
me
of
autumn
nice
helping
of
roast
in
the
taste
dark
malts
very
obvious
chocolate
notes
toffee
pine
no
one
flavor
comes
out
too
strong
very
wellbalanced
and
not
strong
or
heavy
at
all
about
middleofthe
road
mediumbodied
and
pleasantly
drinkable
o
overall
an
excellent
brown
ale
and
an
excellent
offering
from
sn
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brown
quite
tasty
overall
for
some
reason
i
liked
last
years
batch
more
i
was
excited
to
see
this
on
the
shelf
again
but
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
memories
this
was
my
fall
beer
last
year
might
need
something
else
this
year
o
this
is
an
amazing
brown
ale
to
this
point
then
best
i
have
had
every
year
it
is
among
the
top
of
my
list
to
look
fo
on
the
shelves
as
far
as
seasonals
it
makes
me
think
of
a
late
september
or
early
october
day
thats
still
warm
but
damp
and
rainy
this
beer
and
a
movie
are
perfecte
for
that
day
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
kind
of
gritty
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
a
very
good
version
of
an
american
brown
ale
from
sierra
nevada
robust
complex
and
very
well
balanced
pours
out
a
dark
brown
hue
with
a
whitehead
that
leaves
some
really
good
lacing
and
retention
the
smell
is
chocolate
and
some
roasted
malts
the
taste
consists
of
chocolate
maple
a
hint
of
hops
and
some
sweet
malts
that
make
this
a
really
good
tasting
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
easy
drinking
a
must
try
brown
ale
o
a
solid
beer
not
especially
unique
but
one
that
ill
be
having
again
theres
a
definite
seasonal
quality
to
the
beer
that
i
cant
quite
pin
down
but
its
something
to
look
forward
to
in
the
early
fall
overall
i
was
very
impressed
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
o
its
a
great
brown
ale
nice
to
have
as
a
seasonal
beer
but
its
still
no
bells
best
brown
but
im
not
complaining
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
and
a
perfect
beer
for
watching
football
in
the
fall
pours
a
nice
medium
dark
brown
w
very
little
cocoa
head
very
little
carbonation
and
below
average
lacing
nose
is
that
of
yeast
malt
some
hops
yeast
and
smoke
taste
is
very
thin
and
dry
from
what
i
was
expecting
im
wondering
if
the
tap
line
was
clean
because
this
beer
really
disappointed
me
based
on
the
glowing
reviews
ive
read
mouthfeel
is
dry
w
a
little
hop
bitemalt
smoothness
overall
i
wouldnt
look
for
this
again
i
might
pick
up
a
bottle
at
some
point
and
will
adjust
my
review
accordingly
if
needed
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
hints
of
orange
nothing
really
stands
out
in
the
taste
there
are
some
hints
of
nuts
some
roast
and
some
caramel
but
its
full
earthy
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
perfect
for
a
day
of
watching
football
very
nice
autumn
ale
here
o
a
first
rate
brown
ale
that
is
simple
but
quite
enjoyable
this
beer
exudes
autumn
in
a
good
way
the
roasted
characters
balance
the
sweetness
very
well
bottle
pours
a
solid
brown
color
into
a
pint
glass
smell
is
a
slight
sweet
brown
sugar
and
possibly
some
hazelnut
taste
is
a
very
light
brown
sugar
and
some
slight
roasted
malts
with
very
little
in
terms
of
hops
or
bitterness
this
is
very
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
fall
seasonal
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
lingering
taste
of
mint
throughout
has
me
not
enjoying
it
too
much
and
i
wouldnt
mind
just
a
little
more
hops
or
alcohol
in
the
mix
overall
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
ale
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
tried
perfect
beer
to
kick
of
the
cool
weather
i
will
be
frequenting
this
one
for
sure
overall
has
some
interesting
qualities
especially
the
malts
but
i
find
the
balance
off
and
it
isnt
entirely
drinkable
unless
you
specific
like
a
coarser
heavier
malt
brown
ale
after
the
pour
this
one
is
a
great
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
nice
and
thick
light
khaki
head
great
ruby
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
just
a
touch
shy
of
clear
the
smell
is
of
beautiful
roasty
malts
nice
caramels
and
a
bit
of
toffee
with
a
touch
of
west
coast
hop
and
some
light
yeasty
ester
the
taste
reminds
you
that
this
is
an
american
brown
without
overdoing
it
sure
there
are
some
west
coast
citrus
and
pine
hops
in
there
but
the
focus
remains
the
malt
and
the
balance
lies
a
touch
to
the
malt
side
granted
this
beer
has
way
more
hop
than
an
english
leaning
brown
ale
but
there
it
is
clear
its
a
brown
ale
the
mouthfeel
too
is
pretty
good
a
moderate
body
and
and
medium
levels
of
carbonation
with
a
finish
that
is
slightly
drying
with
a
lingering
roast
malt
character
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
brown
ale
the
low
alcohol
and
great
taste
make
it
good
for
a
session
ive
always
been
a
big
brown
ale
fan
and
i
look
forward
to
this
one
every
autumn
o
yeah
this
is
a
good
beer
sierra
nevada
always
does
a
good
job
pours
a
nice
2
finger
head
with
a
lace
that
clings
to
the
glass
dark
mocha
brown
in
appearance
smells
of
sweet
malt
molasseswith
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
tastes
of
sweet
toasted
malt
yeast
and
oats
touch
of
hop
bitterness
near
the
end
this
is
the
only
brown
ale
besides
dogfish
that
i
have
had
that
i
like
while
not
quite
up
to
the
level
of
df
it
is
probably
a
better
representation
of
the
style
i
find
most
brown
ales
to
be
too
sweet
but
this
one
gets
it
right
sweet
but
not
overly
so
o
good
beer
not
my
fav
but
good
a
really
simple
and
clean
offering
from
sn
the
tumbler
is
a
great
example
of
what
it
takes
to
be
a
solid
example
of
the
brown
ale
style
pronounced
but
simple
nuttiness
great
light
body
and
super
sessionable
worth
picking
up
a
sixer
for
sure
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
would
be
approachable
to
folks
who
dont
normally
drink
craft
beer
sierra
nevada
rarely
misses
and
tumbler
is
no
exception
a
smooth
malty
brown
ale
with
some
nice
nuanced
malt
flavors
but
i
with
it
had
a
bit
more
to
offermaybe
some
hop
character
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
easy
drinking
and
nice
for
this
time
of
year
overall
a
tasty
wellbalanced
beer
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
solid
beer
sierra
nevadas
second
best
seasonal
second
only
to
my
beloved
celebration
ale
o
bought
this
to
kick
off
the
football
season
as
well
as
the
autumn
weather
exactly
what
i
was
looking
in
a
fall
seasonal
flavorful
with
a
thick
body
yet
the
ability
to
drink
multiple
in
a
sitting
very
nice
packaging
too
fits
the
brew
perfectly
o
brown
ale
is
far
from
being
one
of
my
favourite
beer
styles
but
ive
come
to
look
forward
to
tumbler
season
its
just
a
little
high
on
the
abv
to
be
considered
a
true
session
beer
but
i
wouldnt

this
all

by
sweet
caramel
in
the
middle
and
mildly
bitter
hops
at
the
finish
aftertaste
is
both
smoky
and
bitter
flavor
like
the
aroma
is
a
bit
subdued
mouthfeel
mediumbodied
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
tingles
a
little
on
the
tongue
drinkability
good
drinkability
you
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
without
any
trouble
overall
solid
beer
overall
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
very
solid
choice
for
a
crisp
autumn
day
overall
tumbler
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
available
as
a
seasonal
the
flavor
profile
could
be
bolder
and
less
carbonation
would
sure
help
the
mouth
feel
of
this
one
o
uncomplicated
and
straightforward
a
good
beer
for
a
fall
weekend
after
raking
the
leaves
or
during
the
big
game
pretty
sure
ill
be
buying
this
again
before
the
season
is
over
i
ordered
this
on
recommendation
from
staff
not
bad
at
all
very
malty
typical
brown
ale
style
in
my
opinion
not
too
boozy
for
me
dark
in
color
i
dont
drink
brown
ales
too
often
but
i
think
this
is
a
great
style
almost
similar
to
stouts
or
porters
i
would
think
overall
id
order
this
again
overall
full
flavored
refreshing
smooth
drinkable
autumn
brew
that
is
perfect
for
the
crisp
bite
of
fall
weather
and
football
season
o
a
bottled
brown
ale
by
sierra
nevada
unfortunately
i
want
to
like
this
beer
much
more
than
i
actually
do
o
a
good
brown
not
overly
complex
in
the
taste
department
but
worthy
of
sampling
o
a
simple
yet
delicious
american
brown
that
does
the
style
justice
you
can
always
count
on
sn
for
that
pours
a
clear
dark
iced
tea
color
with
a
1
inch
puffy
light
brown
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
nice
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
slight
caramel
and
some
spices
taste
is
of
toasted
bread
burnt
caramel
and
a
spicy
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
bitter
spice
taste
that
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
after
each
sip
the
carbonation
level
on
this
one
is
good
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
that
is
very
appropriate
for
a
fall
beer
the
toasty
malt
smells
and
flavors
remind
me
very
much
of
the
season
after
being
impressd
by
ovila
on
tap
and
a
huge
fan
of
british
browns
i
figured
id
try
some
other
sn
this
beer
looks
good
nice
head
with
lacing
the
smell
is
toast
caramel
and
almost
a
cross
between
a
german
dunkel
and
a
nut
brown
the
taste
is
not
bad
and
the
hop
used
are
an
interesting
twist
on
the
style
i
guess
that
is
the
explaination
for
an
american
brown
ale
american
hops
seemed
a
bit
over
carbonated
the
beer
kind
of
explodes
in
your
mouth
i
prefer
more
mellow
carbonation
for
the
style
i
like
the
way
this
beer
looks
big
fluffy
head
tan
colored
and
it
leaves
attractive
looking
lace
behind
the
beer
itself
is
a
warm
reddish
brown
color
and
clear
letting
light
pass
through
casually
aroma
is
wholesomely
malty
and
comforting
kind
of
like
freshly
baked
pumpkin
bread
minus
the
pumpkin
it
is
also
a
little
bit
buttery
with
decomposing
leaves
and
apple
cider
nice
mix
of
scents
taste
is
malty
and
a
little
darker
than
the
scent
more
leafiness
some
dank
bitter
hops
with
both
nuttiness
and
woodiness
this
beer
is
fitting
of
its
name
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
to
mellow
carbonation
somewhat
slick
texture
with
an
added
grittiness
overall
a
solid
brown
ale
fitting
of
the
fall
season
also
rather
sessionable
making
the
12
pack
a
good
choice
o
a
not
disappointing
beer
but
not
as
outright
satisfying
as
some
of
sns
other
offerings
i
think
it
would
be
a
much
nicer
ale
if
it
were
bottleconditioned
andor
offered
on
nitro
tumbler
autumn
brown
ale
is
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
cola
colored
brew
when
held
to
the
light
youll
notice
the
body
is
mostly
dormant
i
just
saw
a
lone
carbonation
bubble
rise
up
topping
the
beer
is
a
large
pillowy
tan
colored
head
with
a
lot
of
lace
left
in
its
wake
the
nose
has
a
lot
going
one
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
a
bit
of
smoke
some
spice
and
cinnamon
maybe
a
touch
of
coffee
and
some
nut
tones
as
well
the
taste
is
kinda
like
your
classic
nut
brown
ale
but
they
did
a
great
job
moving
it
beyond
that
starts
with
a
toasted
caramel
malt
front
a
bit
of
chocolate
fairly
bitter
from
the
hop
some
well
blended
spices
a
touch
of
cinnamon
nutty
a
bit
of
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
just
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
medium
bodied
and
fairly
sharp
on
the
tongue
this
is
an
awesome
little
brown
ale
from
one
of
the
best
craft
breweries
in
the
us
nice
head
and
malty
taste
this
beer
is
perfect
for
all
year
long
to
me
but
i
can
see
an
all
fall
drinking
beer
great
beer
to
watch
football
this
is
not
your
normal
brown
ale
i
will
be
buying
more
before
the
end
of
fall
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
a
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
more
of
roasted
malts
than
i
expected
a
little
coffee
a
little
brown
sugar
feel
is
medium
taste
is
pretty
good
i
get
some
brown
sugar
caramel
roasted
nuts
with
a
bitter
roasted
malt
hop
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
fine
brown
ale
i
actually
got
it
expecting
it
would
be
sweeter
and
i
could
give
it
to
friends
when
they
come
over
i
dont
see
them
liking
it
though
so
ill
just
have
to
drink
the
whole
thing
its
good
so
that
shouldnt
be
a
problem
another
fine
beer
from
a
brewery
which
seldom
disappoints
sn
did
it
again
another
affordable
beer
with
a
lot
of
good
flavor
that
could
prove
to
be
a
gateway
for
folks
just
getting
into
trying
craft
brews
final
thoughts
a
really
great
brew
for
fall
its
a
pretty
perfect
standby
for
the
season
i
very
much
enjoyed
and
will
be
returning
to
this
one
o
i
used
to
love
brown
ales
with
experiencing
other
styles
this
has
pushed
the
brown
a
bit
further
back
on
my
list
however
im
talking
english
browns
this
is
an
american
brown
and
when
it
comes
to
aba
i
havent
much
experience
this
is
a
good
tasting
brew
but
imo
needs
to
have
a
little
more
of
the
killer
flavors
it
has
more
flavor
and
itd
have
been
an
a
brew
to
me
o
if
this
were
year
round
it
would
definitely
replace
the
newcastle
in
the
fridge
a
great
nutbrown
with
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
to
it
a
solid
brown
ale
had
this
on
tap
on
city
tap
house
served
to
me
with
no
head
in
a
standard
pint
glass
but
i
could
easily
imagine
you
get
some
sort
of
tan
foamy
head
appears
brown
in
color
with
reddish
amber
highlights
very
malt
forward
in
aroma
taste
light
roast
notes
in
aroma
somewhat
nutty
in
taste
with
flashes
of
caramel
light
cocoa
maybe
a
little
vanilla
some
chocolate
light
in
mouthfeel
with
nice
even
bitterness
better
as
it
warms
please
dont
drink
cold
as
it
was
served
to
me
a
very
solid
beer
overall
this
another
exceptional
offering
by
sierra
nevada
and
if
it
became
a
regular
offering
id
consider
making
it
my
goto
brown
ale
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
the
roasted
malts
are
balanced
nicely
by
the
sweetness
and
slight
bitterness
the
beer
has
a
nice
complexity
which
makes
it
a
good
choice
for
the
fall
season
mahogany
brown
colored
with
burnished
copper
highlights
thick
head
of
tightly
bubbled
foam
that
lingers
long
low
ara
of
toasted
malt
hints
of
coffee
and
smoke
flavors
of
toasted
medium
dark
malts
caramel
and
oak
bark
some
brown
sugar
dried
leaves
and
leather
mild
bitterness
firm
mouthfeel
full
and
creamy
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
very
good
fall
beer
watch
the
leaves
fall
and
enjoy
o
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
and
it
is
certainly
worthy
of
a
six
pack
pickup
for
the
upcoming
football
season
this
was
a
topnotch
brown
i
would
have
expected
nothing
less
from
such
a
phenomenal
brewery
like
sierra
nevada
overall
not
my
favority
brown
ale
for
fall
but
its
still
a
decent
beer
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
sierra
neveda
since
they
usually
are
top
notch
for
me
o
another
good
brew
from
the
cats
at
sierra
nevada
great
session
beer
in
my
opinion
i
could
drink
them
year
round
i
am
looking
to
buy
the
property
that
is
pictured
on
the
label
props
to
gator
breath
down
in
fiji
for
bringing
this
offering
to
the
table
at
a
nice
price
o
a
tasty
brown
ale
too
bad
its
only
around
for
a
short
time
could
drink
it
year
round
pairs
well
with
sharp
cheddar
on
a
ritz
cracker
o
a
very
good
brown
ale
looks
outstanding
in
the
glass
a
touch
too
much
malt
for
my
taste
almost
like
a
roasted
maibock
o
really
loved
the
taste
of
this
brew
drinks
light
but
with
deep
flavor
i
can
see
where
this
would
be
a
phenomenal
brew
on
a
crisp
fall
night
i
looked
forward
to
those
nights
now
because
of
this
brew
on
tap
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
over
an
inch
of
frothy
tan
head
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
nutty
malty
and
sweet
hints
of
caramel
and
maybe
a
tiny
bit
of
coffee
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
sweet
malty
and
nutty
somewhat
of
a
hazelnut
taste
to
it
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
solid
autumn
beer
overall
worth
grabbing
in
the
autumn
months
for
sure
overall
very
nice
flavor
one
of
the
better
browns
i
have
had
its
flavorful
not
bitter
and
less
watered
down
than
many
browns
out
there
a
great
brown
ale
that
i
would
love
all
year
round
much
less
hop
than
youd
think
from
a
sierra
but
they
are
still
there
more
than
in
most
a
very
good
brown
indeed
and
an
excellent
early
autumn
beer
which
will
be
right
around
the
celebration
release
right
overall
this
is
a
great
autumn
brown
heavy
with
grain
flavors
and
perfect
to
celebrate
the
coming
of
fall
only
the
slight
overbitterness
of
the
hops
mars
what
is
otherwise
a
fantastic
brew
o
a
nice
autumn
session
beer
i
could
see
myself
throwing
back
a
few
of
these
during
a
fall
bonfire
however
its
85
degrees
out
why
do
seasonals
keep
coming
out
earlier
and
earlier
still
a
solid
offering
at
a
great
price
d
its
a
nice
easy
drinker
definitely
the
flavour
strength
and
profile
just
isnt
prominent
enough
for
me
sessionable
but
just
not
interesting
enough
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
brown
color
with
a
decent
looking
head
on
to
the
lacing
was
minimal
and
the
head
faded
kind
face
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
roasted
and
a
little
nutty
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
pretty
good
its
got
a
little
bit
of
autumn
spice
to
it
with
the
roasted
nuts
and
malts
there
isnt
a
lot
of
hops
in
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
is
almost
medium
bodied
overall
its
not
a
bad
brown
ale
its
worth
trying
if
you
like
this
brewery
or
this
style
a
brown
to
amber
color
with
a
light
beige
colored
head
a
half
inch
high
settled
on
the
glass
malt
is
the
strength
of
the
aroma
with
cracked
grain
and
touch
caramel
along
with
a
sugary
syrup
scent
a
hearty
malt
flavor
with
a
dark
bread
and
cracked
flavors
in
there
as
well
it
finishes
with
a
mild
grassy
bitterness
that
counters
the
sweetness
a
watery
thin
feel
at
the
front
of
each
taste
then
it
grow
to
become
more
of
medium
bodied
feel
that
lasts
till
the
end
it
finishes
with
a
light
dryness
on
the
back
of
the
palate
this
beer
is
a
classic
american
brown
ale
with
the
malt
being
the
back
bone
and
the
most
prevalent
characteristic
found
in
the
aroma
and
taste
it
stays
the
line
in
the
style
very
very
drinkable
d
classy
beer
one
of
sierra
nevadas
better
offerings
for
me
personally
very
enjoyable
o
a
solid
brown
ale
great
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
rich
without
being
weighty
or
thick
i
have
tried
alot
of
the
sierra
nevadas
the
ipa
is
awesome
so
i
thought
i
would
give
the
tumbler
a
try
and
it
had
a
nice
amber
color
close
to
an
amber
marzen
nice
foam
just
threw
it
in
a
pint
glass
was
pretty
good
would
defiantly
buy
it
again
d
t
roasted
malts
with
a
touch
of
nuttiness
and
maybe
a
dash
of
maple
a
slight
hoppiness
rounds
things
out
this
is
a
good
brown
it
just
doesnt
really
have
anything
to
it
that
really
makes
it
stand
out
chocolate
brown
with
a
tightbubbled
dirty
white
head
very
subtle
roast
lends
a
hint
of
cocoa
powder
smoke
to
the
predominately
carameltoffee
laced
malt
bill
hops
are
fairly
assertive
for
the
style
with
a
great
earthywoodsy
quality
that
is
definitely
reminiscent
of
fall
i
wanted
a
little
more
out
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
from
the
king
of
american
craft
brewing
but
it
still
satisfies
enough
to
warrant
a
sixer
or
two
each
year
not
too
excited
from
this
beer
you
win
some
you
lose
some
this
didnt
really
leave
a
particular
impression
either
way
on
me
but
it
was
not
bad
the
aroma
was
very
sweet
lots
of
hints
of
caramel
and
especially
maple
syrup
coming
through
on
this
one
the
aroma
though
was
thin
in
depth
as
once
you
got
past
this
maple
like
aroma
there
was
not
much
else
to
be
found
maybe
some
slight
roasted
grains
and
a
touch
of
nut
like
aroma
but
that
was
about
it
still
not
half
bad
the
flavor
followed
along
the
aroma
very
closely
and
honestly
reminded
me
of
another
brew
the
tommyknocker
maple
brown
in
that
level
of
sweetness
tons
of
maple
sugar
here
and
alot
of
nutty
flavors
as
well
some
nice
roasted
malt
notes
as
well
in
here
a
slightly
grassy
and
earthy
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
but
everything
was
completely
dominated
by
the
maple
syrup
like
sweetness
a
bit
too
over
the
top
for
me
to
be
honest
the
feel
was
very
carbonated
with
a
load
of
bubbles
racing
through
giving
it
a
very
soda
like
feel
nice
to
see
coming
out
of
the
can
for
sure
light
in
testure
without
much
of
a
follow
through
it
came
in
ok
for
me
nothing
really
special
but
nowhere
near
flat
in
anyway
nor
did
it
really
feel
very
thin
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
quite
high
here
at
5
5
i
could
have
quite
a
few
overall
i
was
pretty
impressed
b
this
brew
ccb
maduro
is
the
gold
standard
in
the
style
but
this
one
isnt
far
behind
skal
pours
a
medium
chestnut
brown
with
a
singlefinger
offwhite
head
that
stays
around
for
a
bit
before
falling
and
leaving
some
spotty
lacing
behind
the
nose
has
some
slight
nutty
character
along
with
a
bit
of
slightlyroasted
malt
as
a
backbone
slightly
dry
with
a
bit
of
earth
the
flavor
falls
along
the
same
lines
theres
nothing
too
exceptional
about
this
one
i
would
say
that
its
a
bit
hoppy
though
not
along
the
india
brown
ale
lineits
got
more
of
an
earthy
kick
to
the
finish
that
im
enjoying
body
is
medium
with
average
carbonation
overall
a
solid
brew
but
not
quite
the
level
i
expect
from
sierra
nevada
a
nice
brown
ale
the
earthiness
may
get
old
after
a
couple
and
just
not
interesting
enough
to
want
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
but
a
nice
fall
beer
overall
i
thought
it
was
an
excellent
brown
ale
the
bitterness
balanced
out
the
sweet
malt
really
well
taste
is
mild
but
thick
and
chewy
hints
of
slightly
roasted
malts
and
a
gentle
hoppy
followthrough
very
delicious
and
will
be
a
repeat
purchase
next
year
d
very
drinkable
american
brown
ale
if
your
tongue
has
an
affinity
towards
bitterness
but
want
to
get
away
from
ipas
and
travel
further
down
the
maltspectrum
this
is
a
beer
for
you
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
ever
had
as
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
category
had
on
tap
at
a
bar
in
arlington
as
well
as
from
a
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
light
brown
with
large
camel
colored
head
aroma
is
light
nut
little
lacing
and
thin
soft
body
taste
is
dark
toasty
malt
medium
lightly
roasted
nut
a
hint
of
smoke
and
finishes
with
some
hops
good
for
an
english
brown
ale
style
beer
d
it
tastes
like
a
pale
ale
with
a
few
fall
flavors
thrown
in
dvery
sessionable
a
sold
fall
beer
d
this
beer
is
low
in
the
abv
department
making
it
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
all
night
the
flavor
just
brings
it
all
full
circle
i
would
recommend
this
to
everyone
who
doesnt
know
if
they
really
like
browns
as
this
will
change
their
minds
d
on
a
fall
night
this
might
be
better
off
than
an
octoberfest
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
drink
plenty
more
over
the
years
crystal
clear
brown
at
the
pour
with
a
big
white
head
slight
roast
and
pale
malt
aroma
flavor
is
well
balanced
but
i
am
not
crazy
about
it
at
all
malt
flavor
is
muted
and
none
of
the
malt
character
stands
out
there
is
a
bracing
bitterness
that
is
balanced
but
not
flavorful
an
ok
beer
but
not
up
there
with
the
best
of
american
brown
ales
d
leave
it
to
sn
to
make
such
a
sessionable
brown
ale
i
could
easily
drink
a
sixer
of
this
on
a
nice
fall
day
d
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
sierra
nevada
i
forget
what
their
fall
seasonal
was
before
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
this
one
when
it
comes
around
again
it
had
a
nice
malt
and
caramel
flavor
along
with
a
nice
finish
but
other
than
that
its
pretty
one
dimensional
light
brown
head
of
thick
foamy
bubbles
that
leave
a
very
clingy
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
beer
is
a
nice
dark
brown
matching
a
26
on
the
srm
beer
color
scale
very
transparent
even
though
it
is
quite
dark
with
good
light
i
can
read
through
it
smell
of
chestnuts
cinnamon
wheat
apples
and
malt
tastes
of
golden
wheat
toffee
citrus
and
barley
malt
goodly
amount
of
body
in
this
one
as
i
swish
it
around
in
my
mouth
too
bad
it
is
seasonal
but
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
the
next
taste
come
the
almost
end
of
2011
this
was
a
rich
dark
brown
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
was
brownish
in
color
as
well
the
scent
had
lots
of
roasted
malt
with
caramel
and
a
hint
of
citrus
to
it
which
got
me
excited
all
of
this
was
in
the
taste
this
was
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
when
this
beer
was
poured
it
was
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
2
white
head
to
it
the
after
a
little
bit
of
time
left
some
nice
sticky
lace
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
the
taste
is
very
nice
had
a
nice
balance
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
very
smooth
and
is
very
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
on
the
back
porch
during
autumn
while
grilling
great
job
on
this
one
d
a
very
easy
drinking
brown
ale
very
true
to
the
style
with
a
nice
amount
of
smokiness
i
think
this
beer
would
be
absolutely
perfect
with
a
great
smokey
barbeque
not
too
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
browns
ive
had
d
an
ideal
autumn
beer
would
enjoy
tasting
this
again
pours
a
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
barely
enough
to
cover
the
top
smells
of
roasted
malts
slight
hint
of
chocolate
and
caramel
hops
also
coming
through
taste
is
very
smooth
good
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
initially
with
a
sweet
chocolate
taste
on
the
back
end
nothing
to
complain
about
on
the
mouth
feel
either
drinkable
beer
not
the
greatest
but
very
good
this
one
is
alright
but
i
know
sierra
nevada
can
and
does
do
better
this
was
interesting
the
flavors
of
roast
earth
and
sweetness
all
had
a
fall
flair
to
them
but
i
just
dont
know
if
the
overall
package
here
really
ended
up
coming
together
for
me
perhaps
this
is
one
that
works
on
you
over
the
course
of
a
few
bottles
id
be
willing
to
investigate
this
again
come
next
fall
my
girlfriend
gave
me
a
sip
of
this
a
few
months
ago
and
i
immediately
fell
in
love
with
it
within
a
few
weeks
it
was
already
gone
from
shelves
though
and
i
thought
id
missed
my
opportunity
till
i
spied
it
on
a
recent
supermarket
visit
and
swept
it
up
this
beer
paris
well
with
all
kinds
of
hearty
food
and
stands
well
on
its
own
definitely
going
to
become
a
fall
staple
for
me
tumbler
pours
a
perfect
dark
brown
smellign
of
roasted
malt
and
nutty
goodness
first
sip
is
a
mix
of
hops
and
chocolate
caramel
deliciousness
nice
malt
backbone
and
easy
going
down
nice
drinkable
brown
ale
for
session
drinking
certainly
worth
your
money
and
time
to
enjoy
understated
to
a
fault
this
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
amber
hues
the
head
is
a
massive
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
some
faint
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
lighter
it
is
almost
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
ligher
side
of
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
quite
lacking
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
again
d
the
drinkability
is
awesome
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
ale
it
is
smooth
and
goes
down
very
easy
it
is
quite
refreshing
and
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
give
it
a
try
this
west
coast
beauty
has
the
right
goods
deep
mahogany
brown
though
perhaps
a
bit
clean
looking
for
a
proper
brown
ale
this
is
a
brew
that
has
copious
malting
and
just
a
hint
of
hopping
ah
but
what
beautiful
hopping
it
is
it
is
a
slightly
warming
brew
that
will
not
overwhelm
you
with
alpha
acids
well
balanced
with
a
nice
roasted
chicory
flavor
and
a
slightly
sweet
marshmallow
aftertaste
this
is
a
welcome
addition
to
the
sierra
family
and
one
i
would
like
to
see
more
ofter
produced
by
other
talented
brewers
great
effort
d
good
brew
12oz
355ml
bottle
from
ryans
party
store
in
port
huron
michigan
pours
dark
brown
with
a
faint
ruby
tinge
one
finger
of
bubbly
beige
foam
and
sheets
of
lace
on
the
nonic
glass
smell
is
nutty
bready
and
doughy
malts
earthy
and
floral
hops
touch
of
cream
and
some
tree
bark
flavour
is
light
chocolate
grainy
and
roasted
malts
slight
sweetness
biscuit
brown
sugar
and
a
balancing
hop
bitterness
with
fruity
and
grassy
undertones
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
crisp
spiciness
upfront
brief
flash
of
astringency
quick
and
toasty
finish
with
very
little
aftertaste
the
palate
thins
out
significantly
as
the
beer
warms
and
the
nose
is
pretty
restrained
but
aside
from
these
flaws
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
that
ive
tried
12
oz
single
from
fred
meyer
s
salem
poured
unfortunatlly
with
a
huge
billowing
head
tan
in
colour
can
make
out
the
clear
brown
ale
underneath
aroma
i
found
lacking
mostly
bready
cereal
and
some
weak
chocolate
taste
is
mellow
semisweet
and
welcoming
coffee
and
milk
chocolate
with
some
hazelnuts
thrown
in
nice
nice
smooth
palate
makes
this
a
drinkable
enough
brown
ale
though
not
exceptional
in
any
way
brown
ale
by
definition
is
rather
tame
and
typically
not
my
favourite
style
however
sierra
nevada
does
it
justice
with
their
version
fairly
hoppy
but
not
so
much
as
to
push
the
boundaries
of
the
style
i
like
the
super
clean
character
it
brings
the
malts
into
focus
cant
really
complain
about
anything
here
about
as
good
as
a
brown
ale
gets
not
my
first
choice
at
the
store
or
a
bar
but
i
sure
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
this
is
definitely
interesting
to
see
coming
from
sierra
nevada
not
their
characteristic
hoppy
ipa
or
pa
im
still
a
little
back
and
forth
on
whether
or
not
i
like
this
beer
there
is
something
about
the
aftertaste
that
i
just
cant
place
that
leaves
a
funny
slickness
off
flavor
never
a
disappointment
with
sierra
nevada
a
very
good
beer
d
though
the
overall
feel
was
ordinary
the
smooth
texture
and
great
taste
make
this
an
easy
and
enjoyable
drinker
in
all
honesty
the
brown
ale
has
never
been
a
favorite
style
if
i
had
a
go
to
brand
it
would
be
newcastle
brown
still
this
one
is
done
reasonably
well
a
fine
brown
ale
and
a
terrific
autumnly
ale
more
octoberfestish
than
the
ales
labels
as
such
have
one
or
more
in
front
of
a
fire
on
a
cool
evening
recommended
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
decent
representation
of
the
style
and
a
beer
i
would
serve
for
a
tailgate
session
this
is
one
of
better
browns
that
come
to
mind
for
sure
sierra
nevada
rarely
goes
wrong
such
a
pleasant
beer
for
a
pleasant
afternoon
happy
thanksgiving
ba
this
is
a
super
drinkable
and
sessionable
brown
ale
and
a
great
addition
to
the
sn
seasonal
lineup
this
one
is
still
drinking
wonderfully
even
into
the
winter
months
this
brew
pours
a
reddish
brown
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
some
subtle
lacingthe
smell
is
very
roasty
with
hints
of
roasted
maltstoffee
and
some
earthy
hops
toothe
mouthfeel
is
a
little
under
medium
bodied
which
really
suits
it
and
has
tastes
of
roasted
maltstoffeemolasses
and
is
finished
off
with
a
earthy
hop
bitterness
which
is
quite
bitteroverall
im
not
suprised
its
a
decent
drop
that
is
very
drinkable
from
this
fine
brewery
and
to
be
honest
could
quite
easily
drink
more
than
two
of
these
if
it
was
a
regular
to
our
shores
overall
an
unusual
brown
ale
the
weird
medicinal
thing
is
throwing
me
off
not
my
favorite
ok
session
style
brown
ale
nothing
i
would
run
out
to
buy
drink
an
interesting
beer
but
not
something
id
have
again
fans
of
smoky
beers
might
enjoy
this
one
quite
a
bit
ive
had
tumbler
several
times
this
fall
i
think
i
was
enjoying
this
more
a
month
or
two
ago
i
am
over
the
fall
varieties
of
beer
its
weird
how
you
look
forward
to
different
types
of
beer
when
just
a
couple
of
them
can
satisfy
your
craving
for
an
entire
year
dont
get
me
wrong
this
beer
is
really
good
its
very
dark
brown
and
pours
with
a
great
head
on
top
that
lasts
i
like
that
it
is
nutty
but
not
overly
sweet
or
brown
sugary
it
reminded
me
of
newcastle
but
even
better
ill
be
ready
to
tackle
another
six
pack
of
this
come
next
fall
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
smooth
and
semidry
out
of
a
squat
bomber
bottle
this
beer
was
a
rich
autumnal
brown
color
with
some
bronze
highlights
that
appeared
when
held
up
to
light
the
one
finger
of
khaki
colored
head
retained
itself
fairly
well
leaving
streaks
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
toasted
malt
some
bread
and
biscuit
notes
and
a
little
chocolate
malt
as
well
the
flavors
were
very
similar
with
more
of
an
emphasis
on
the
roasted
malt
and
the
addition
of
enough
hops
to
make
the
finish
quite
dry
but
clean
a
little
sweet
malt
lingered
on
my
palate
after
the
last
gulp
but
in
a
pleasant
way
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
good
as
well
very
drinkable
american
brown
pours
nice
dark
amber
with
thin
white
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
sometimes
brown
ales
are
a
bit
too
sweet
and
cloying
this
one
seems
to
have
found
the
right
balance
for
me
has
a
nice
brown
sugar
molasses
on
the
nose
and
palate
very
fresh
the
balance
here
is
the
hops
definetely
more
than
in
a
traditional
brown
ale
this
beer
has
a
fullness
without
being
too
heavy
or
overbearing
overall
a
very
nice
brew
perfect
for
fall
d
goes
down
easy
leaving
you
wanting
more
the
nose
is
a
sweet
malty
blend
of
toasted
nuts
and
vanilla
the
flavor
is
sweet
a
solid
blend
of
slightly
toasted
malt
brown
sugar
and
a
finish
of
subtle
hops
the
feel
is
about
medium
thickness
but
that
hops
at
the
end
really
helps
crispen
each
sip
preparing
for
the
next
in
a
very
nice
way
that
makes
this
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
d
a
decent
fall
seasonal
brew
atmosphere
is
really
solid
here
really
nice
appearance
manifests
in
a
deep
dark
body
and
full
thick
head
complete
with
some
very
substantial
lacing
nose
is
a
great
balance
of
malt
hops
and
a
nice
nutty
or
woody
tone
flavor
follows
suit
rich
and
malt
but
with
a
nice
hop
note
all
wrapped
up
in
a
nutty
woody
bittersweet
package
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
d
the
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
perfect
fall
offering
thats
quite
sessionable
drain
pour
ive
had
quite
a
few
tumblers
throughout
this
season
and
i
must
say
that
it
is
yet
another
superbly
crafted
beer
from
sierra
nevada
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
not
very
stong
medium
bodied
with
a
rich
and
creamy
consistency
this
beer
was
nice
to
try
but
not
a
personal
favorite
brown
ale
d
not
sure
that
i
would
choose
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
is
a
good
beer
d
not
very
drinkable
to
me
it
has
great
flavor
but
the
bitterness
takes
away
from
the
finish
half
way
through
overall
not
a
terrible
american
brown
ale
but
not
one
to
write
home
about
couldve
gone
with
more
hop
aroma
and
flavor
and
less
roastiness
d
a
beer
perfectly
suited
for
that
chilly
october
night
warm
and
malt
forward
with
an
earthy
bitterness
in
every
bottle
that
is
case
worthy
to
share
outdoors
along
the
fire
pit
with
friends
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
julian
dated
september
8
2010
into
my
zatec
fluted
glass
glorious
3
fingers
of
tan
head
deep
dark
brown
body
smells
of
toasted
nuts
floral
and
piney
hops
maybe
a
little
bit
of
dark
chocolate
maybe
not
nutty
flavor
dry
bitter
hops
on
the
finish
a
touch
of
cocoa
comes
through
as
the
last
flavor
very
light
bodied
mouth
drying
exceptionally
drinkable
great
sessionable
brown
because
of
all
the
contrasting
flavors
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
but
it
was
very
interesting
and
fun
to
enjoy
once
d
good
but
left
me
wanting
unsatisfied
d
very
drinkable
its
pretty
wellbalanced
and
the
alcohol
is
moderate
this
beer
pours
out
of
the
bottle
a
dark
amber
with
ruby
highlights
topped
off
with
a
thick
frothy
faintly
tancolored
head
the
head
foams
up
into
a
large
cloud
but
soon
dissipates
leaving
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
it
goes
the
nose
is
fairly
faint
with
a
subtle
malt
flavor
coming
through
and
just
a
little
hop
crispness
which
only
seems
to
emphasize
the
malts
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
very
closely
the
main
flavor
is
a
smooth
well
balanced
malt
character
with
just
the
right
hop
crispness
to
emphasize
those
malts
without
being
too
noticeable
on
its
own
this
beer
has
quite
a
good
mouth
feel
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
and
it
goes
down
quite
smoothly
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
a
few
of
any
time
from
fall
through
early
spring
sierra
nevada
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
its
taste
is
really
reminiscent
of
a
crisp
fall
day
tumbler
autumn
brown
ale
doesnt
seriously
challenge
the
best
american
browns
but
its
another
solid
effort
from
one
of
this
countrys
finest
and
most
consistently
good
craft
breweries
what
better
way
to
watch
the
autumn
leaves
tumble
down
outside
my
front
window
than
with
a
bottle
of
wellbrewed
brown
ale
i
really
hope
sn
keeps
brewing
this
one
every
year
as
it
is
simply
amazing
i
realize
a
few
hop
fanatics
out
there
may
miss
their
fall
ipa
but
to
me
this
is
much
more
interesting
and
a
truly
memorable
classic
rather
than
just
a
beer
to
tie
me
over
until
celebration
arrives
notes
this
was
my
first
beer
from
sierra
nevada
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
after
tasting
such
a
great
beer
a
terrific
beer
even
if
you
are
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
good
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
a
good
choice
if
nothing
else
is
around
dr
this
beer
is
so
mild
and
mellow
that
you
could
drink
a
bunch
nothing
impressive
about
it
just
easy
to
drink
moderately
carbonated
and
medium
in
body
this
brew
is
crisp
enough
to
be
refreshing
but
complex
enough
to
keep
this
from
being
boring
drinkability
most
definitely
drinkable
aside
from
the
fact
that
i
wished
it
was
a
bit
stronger
and
pronounced
in
flavor
it
was
definitely
pleasant
to
drink
i
plan
to
buy
this
again
d
really
a
nice
moderate
beer
from
sn
nice
and
well
rounded
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
would
make
a
great
grill
out
beer
nice
change
of
pace
brew
from
sn
pours
a
dark
copperbrown
head
is
about
an
inch
of
creamy
foam
that
settles
to
a
nice
cap
smell
wasnt
all
that
greatnot
too
distinguished
taste
is
quite
nice
malt
dominates
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
touch
of
hop
bitterness
i
do
wish
it
had
a
tad
more
body
it
is
a
bit
thin
overall
a
pleasant
take
on
a
classic
english
style
ale
glad
to
have
tried
it
pours
a
darker
copper
color
with
a
thin
cap
of
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
a
lot
of
nutty
toasted
malt
in
the
aroma
but
also
some
sweeter
molasses
notes
mixing
in
the
taste
follows
suit
of
the
aroma
lots
of
toasted
malt
nuttiness
with
some
piney
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
more
nuttiness
on
the
lingering
slightly
astringent
finish
body
is
medium
and
creamy
and
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
tasty
brown
ale
dpretty
decent
offering
for
the
style
although
not
a
personal
favorite
i
definitely
prefer
a
brown
ale
with
less
roasted
and
hop
characteristics
d
easy
to
drink
quality
ingredients
good
for
the
style
although
i
like
more
aggressive
flavors
in
my
brews
im
not
real
big
on
nut
browns
but
thisone
worked
good
job
on
tembler
first
offering
from
sierra
nevada
that
ive
tried
and
would
like
to
try
more
poured
into
my
standard
pilsner
not
the
correct
glassware
but
oh
well
lovely
rubybrown
color
with
a
one
inch
head
and
long
lasting
fluff
lacing
as
well
nice
smell
was
sweet
malt
as
was
the
flavor
strangely
i
got
almost
nothing
on
the
flavor
with
a
nice
sweet
aftertaste
malt
70hops
30
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
drinkability
was
great
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
or
an
introduction
to
craft
for
someone
you
wouldnt
want
to
blow
away
with
a
west
coast
ipa
first
taste
is
rich
creamy
chocolatey
malts
with
enough
hops
to
keep
the
tongue
interested
then
pain
ensues
for
me
recommended
doverall
that
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
balance
is
even
enough
to
make
the
a
session
beer
with
enough
flavor
to
enjoy
d
its
a
little
bit
blah
easy
to
drink
a
little
watery
notes
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
hoppier
than
its
english
counterparts
but
great
nonetheless
a
simple
beer
that
offers
a
most
excellent
drinking
experience
great
for
fledgling
beer
drinkers
and
more
experienced
bas
alike
d
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
brown
ale
that
is
very
pleasing
to
the
palate
d
easy
drinking
abv
is
in
line
the
carbonation
is
probably
the
only
downside
not
always
a
great
texture
and
can
be
filling
flavors
are
certainly
appropriate
for
colder
weathers
overall
good
beer
a
highly
drinkable
version
of
the
style
good
unique
hopmalt
balance
in
the
flavor
profile
this
keg
wont
last
me
long
a
nice
easy
drinkable
brown
a
pretty
clean
taste
with
no
objectionable
aftertaste
theres
a
touch
of
maple
or
some
other
sweetness
maybe
my
mind
is
stuck
on
the
label
but
it
reminds
me
of
october
pumpkins
falling
leaves
and
halloween
drinkability
is
lower
because
i
just
cant
get
over
that
odd
aroma
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
finger
and
a
half
creamy
tan
head
a
desent
amount
of
lacing
aromas
of
carmel
malts
and
coffee
on
the
palate
toasted
barley
chocolate
and
dry
white
bread
with
a
hint
of
metal
finish
good
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
all
in
all
id
give
it
two
thumbs
up
the
smell
has
is
almost
spot
on
with
taste
but
the
toasty
roasty
and
nutty
malts
are
overshadowed
a
bit
by
the
bitter
middle
all
the
way
to
aftertaste
still
good
and
very
sessionable
i
already
bought
another
twelver
of
this
beer
and
i
will
do
it
again
as
long
as
its
available
d
very
drinkable
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
transparent
nut
brown
with
a
mammoth
tan
head
that
leaves
tons
of
soapy
lace
the
aroma
is
nutty
and
grainy
with
toasted
malts
hints
of
caramel
and
just
a
bit
of
citrus
in
the
finish
the
flavor
is
full
of
toasted
malts
and
grains
the
pallet
is
coated
with
a
nutty
flavor
the
taste
is
also
very
earthy
i
would
imagine
dried
leaves
to
be
an
ingredient
in
this
the
mouthfeel
seems
kind
of
thick
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
lower
than
i
would
prefer
on
this
one
overall
this
one
is
acceptable
and
easy
enough
to
drink
poured
up
nice
and
dark
in
the
tumbler
but
with
less
than
a
halfinch
of
head
the
head
looked
lazy
as
if
forced
there
for
effect
a
young
caramelycharcoaly
smell
made
a
good
second
impression
rich
chocolaty
taste
burst
through
immediately
but
fizzled
out
thinly
very
quickly
half
way
through
the
glass
it
thinned
out
some
more
leaving
me
enjoying
a
beverage
that
just
as
easily
could
have
been
something
other
than
beer
very
light
carbonation
overall
decent
experience
and
i
had
another
but
i
saw
no
reason
to
continue
would
drink
it
again
but
no
reason
to
seek
it
out
poured
a
nice
clear
ruby
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
this
had
a
musty
earthy
moldy
kinda
scent
to
it
taste
is
dominated
by
these
flavors
and
lots
of
roasted
malt
overall
while
pleasant
i
found
this
to
be
kind
of
bland
i
didnt
taste
that
much
in
the
hops
department
i
know
the
ibus
were
supposedly
at
35
feel
is
kinda
light
and
drying
decent
easydrinking
but
not
too
memorable
especially
when
compared
to
sierra
nevadas
many
other
excellent
offerings
pours
a
translucent
nut
brown
hints
to
some
orangered
around
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
finger
or
so
of
white
head
fades
to
a
thin
layer
and
bubbles
leaves
some
moderate
lace
nose
is
fairly
tame
light
notes
of
nuttiness
and
molasses
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
in
the
same
boat
light
notes
of
chocolate
nuttiness
and
a
prominent
malt
medium
carbonation
and
a
relatively
light
body
quite
good
drinkability
and
surely
sessionable
not
sure
if
id
go
out
and
pick
up
a
whole
bunch
of
this
though
a
bit
tame
unexciting
and
restrained
altogether
this
beer
drinks
very
easily
i
could
work
my
way
through
most
of
a
six
pack
easily
it
is
unlike
other
beers
from
sierra
nevada
but
still
worth
your
attnetion
d
this
was
not
bitter
or
sweet
surprisingly
dull
for
sierra
nevada
the
body
wasnt
great
either
but
at
least
it
was
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
least
interesting
or
enjoyable
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
seemed
more
like
a
marzen
and
i
guess
they
didnt
want
to
call
it
their
octoberfest
since
everyone
has
one
these
days
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
does
so
much
right
i
could
not
find
anything
to
complain
about
really
well
crafted
and
i
would
for
sure
look
for
this
guy
again
its
a
really
good
beer
very
tasty
and
really
well
balanced
its
different
enough
to
give
some
oomph
to
a
beer
line
up
though
lovely
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
up
front
with
a
return
of
a
nutty
cocoa
flavor
pleasant
feel
and
finish
without
the
paparazzi
the
girl
next
door
this
an
interesting
very
drinkable
american
brown
ale
earlier
today
i
enjoyed
an
english
brewed
brown
ale
both
were
excellent
examples
the
english
being
rather
earthy
exotic
with
lots
of
subtle
flavors
the
american
being
cleanvibrant
and
straight
forward
very
drinkable
and
tasty
brown
a
great
sessionable
beer
drinkability
is
large
with
more
flavor
than
the
avg
aba
but
low
alcohol
level
this
is
a
winner
and
an
awesome
value
too
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
nice
dark
brown
cola
color
with
a
1
finger
light
brown
head
with
moderate
carbonation
the
aroma
was
of
burnt
caramel
sweet
malts
and
a
mild
hop
balance
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
sweet
brown
sugar
taste
but
settles
with
a
finish
of
slight
bitter
hops
i
have
had
a
few
and
the
more
i
try
this
brew
the
more
the
subtle
flavors
become
complex
this
is
really
well
made
and
balanced
brew
good
carbonation
good
flavor
and
good
balance
makes
this
worth
a
try
for
sure

and
some
mild

medium
bodied
with
a
moderate

and

finish
solid
and
appropriate
for
the
season
drinkability
even
for
a
brewery
i
like
as
much
as
s
n
this
is
one
of
their
best
offerings
nothing
too
complex
but
very
very
tasty
very
clean
i
could
easily
do
a
six
drinkability
a
great
session
beer
for
fallwinter
this
sixer
was
gone
in
a
flash
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
brown
ale
that
is
simple
but
not
boring
in
that
respect
very
well
crafted
and
balanced
a
beer
i
would
always
welcome
drinkability
is
good
favorable
tasty
treat
with
nothing
to
complain
about
not
a
big
brown
ale
fan
but
this
one
is
quite
enjoyable
pours
a
dark
brownamber
with
a
foamy
white

pretty
good
lacing
and
head
retention
aroma
of
roasted
nuts
coco
and
some

strong

basically
follows

almonds
starts
the
flavor
off
hint
of
roasted
chocolate
follows
as
a
bit
of
sweetness
shine
through
in
the
malt
pretty
hoppy
for
the
style
as
the
beer
finishes
with
a
good
rush
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
different
but
nice
flavor
medium
bodied
above
average
carbonation
d
good
abv
and
very
good
flavors
very
drinkable
brew
good
fall
beer
with
it
is
getting
a
little
cooler
outside
i
think
it
is
the
toasted
roasted
part
worth
looking
for
this
is
a
good
fall
beer
and
another
good
one
from
sierra
nevada
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
thats
going
great
with
the
cooler
nights
that
are
happening
it
has
a
good
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
its
worth
picking
up
a
six
pack
to
give
it
a
try
drinkability
glad
i
picked
up
this
single
im
not
the
biggest
brown
ale
fan
but
this
is
most
certainly
a
great
autumn
beer
easily
quaffable
and
enjoyable
on
this
cool
autumn
night
taste
is
strong
toasted
barley
faintly
caramelly
and
clean
clear
bread
crust
a
leafypepperyfaintly
woody
hop
bitterness
just
dominates
the
light
sweetness
especially
in
the
finish
and
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
if
warmer
it
has
a
more
wineyjuicy
and
zestylively
character
and
the
bitterness
is
less
sharp
if
drunk
too
cold
the
bitterness
is
a
little
too
sharp
it
is
not
very
complex
but
it
is
solid
and
wellrounded
the
flavours
clean
firm
clear
and
it
is
pretty
well
balanced

is
solid
and
firm
as
noted

lively
if
warmer
mouthfeeldrinkability
just
a
hair
under
medium
bodied
with
pretty
nice
carbonation
a
bit
light
for
my
taste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
that
i
would
buy
again
in
the
future
d
i
would
order
a
second
and
probably
buy
next
year
again
a
pretty
good
brown
but
not
stellar
a
great
fall
beer
very
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
pretty
simple
but
with
plenty
of
flavor
a
nice
drinkable
fall
beer
d
not
bad
not
preferred
by
any
means
either
d
great
flavor
not
syrupy
or
overly
caramely
or
sweet
i
prefer
hops
but
if
im
going
to
go
malt
then
this
is
very
drinkable
brew
overall
one
of
the
better
browns
ive
had
in
a
while
its
a
bit
subdued
and
watery
though
the
carbonation
is
pretty
low
in
this
beer
which
lends
to
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
velvety
smooth
tumbler
definitely
highlights
the
increasingly
rare
malt
flavors
that
can
be
found
in
beers
but
sn
doesnt
forget
their
hopcentric
roots
and
have
created
arguably
one
of
the
more
balanced
browns
ive
tasted
sn
can
cross
brown
ale
off
their
list
of
perfected
beer
styles
drinkability
i
could
find
myself
drinking
this
all
day

overpowered
sierra
nevada
tumbler
pours
with
about
2
fingers
of
fluffy
just
off
white
dense
head
which
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
beer
has
a
distinctly
nutty
smell
with
a
roasted
malt
smell
and
a
bit
of
sweet
or
caramel
smell
under
that
it
has
a
lot
of
nutty
flavor
as
well
along
with
a
little
bit
of
coffee
and
a
little
bit
but
not
much
bitterness
it
has
lively
carbonation
with
a
good
bite
but
maybe
a
bit
light
on
the
mouthfeel
for
me
very
drinkable
good
cheap
early
fall
beer
not
a
bad
brown
ale
from
sierra
nevada
this
fits
nicely
in
with
the
porter
and
pale
ale
though
i
really
wish
they
would
get
rid
of
or
revamp
the
stout
this
definitely
hits
the
spot
when
i
have
a
hankering
for
a
nicely
malt
focused
brown
ale
though
there
is
a
touch
of
hop
character
here
as
well
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
sierra
nevada
can
they
do
anything
wrong
12
ozs
in
a
chimay
glass
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
nose
was
pretty
exciting
of
course
the
honey
and
the
toasty
malts
but
i
encountered
some
smokiness
as
well
as
some
spice
clove
to
be
exact
i
picked
this
up
for
my
brotherinlaws
bday
we
paired
it
with
some
oxtail
and
potatoes
excellent
pairing
i
was
surprised
at
the
drinkability
had
like
3
or
4
no
problem
definitley
pick
this
up
for
dinner
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
offering
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
quite
easy
drinking
but
a
bit
unbalanced
with
the
favoring
of
the
hops
running
wild
regardless
no
problems
finishing
the
glass
pours
a
nice
clear
teabrown
looks
a
lot
better
than
most
brown
ales
imo
a
thin
wispy
tan
head
leaves
lace
around
the
glass
smell
is
a
little
muted
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
mineral
funk
taste
is
better
though
a
mellow
toasty
malt
turns
nutty
and
blends
ohsowell
with
a
tart
hoppy
background
very
nice
fell
is
nicely
carbonated
and
very
smooth
but
dry
at
the
same
time
drinkability
is
good
a
fine
brown
ale
by
sn
db
another
solid
inexpensive
beer
by
sierra
nevada
lots
of
great
malt
flavors
exist
here
in
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
can
think
of
definitely
worth
getting
a
sixer
of
great
interpretation
of
the
brown
ale
style
sierra
nevada
is
always
a
winner
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
autumn
brown
ale
highly
drinkable
in
that
i
could
have
an
entire
6
pack
at
any
given
time
a
wonderful
introduction
to
sierra
nevada
notes
for
a
2
50
bomber
this
is
well
worth
it
definitely
a
good
beer
beer
pours
a
ruby
redbrown
color
with
a
nice
head
a
bit
soapy
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
scents
of
toasted
hazelnuts
walnuts
etc
shine
through
medium
body
with
a
roasty
toasty
good
flavor
nutty
palate
some
coffee
and
sweetness
but
not
overly
and
a
good
shot
of
hops
balance
the
maltiness
out
pretty
easy
drinker
here
but
what
else
is
new
sierra
nevada
is
always
a
great
starter
beer
for
the
novice
in
all
styles
d
tumbler
drinks
really
easy
the
moderate
alcohol
makes
this
easily
sessionable
and
quite
enjoyable
overall
quite
pleasing
a
nice
brown
ale
i
very
much
like
the
floralchocolate
combo
this
isnt
my
favorite
brown
ale
by
far
but
i
would
drink
it
again
d
very
drinkable
the
flavor
is
bold
but
not
too
bold
i
could
easily
put
away
6
of
these
in
a
session
picked
up
a
single
to
try
this
one
from
sierra
nevada
i
dont
usually
go
for
brown
ales
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
in
that
it
looked
like
a
typical
brown
but
had
more
of
a
smoked
porter
flavormore
muted
than
a
straight
smoked
porter
but
more
than
the
usual
brown
toast
flavors
interesting
to
try
d
nice
this
is
yet
again
a
tasty
offering
from
sierra
nevada
this
is
worth
trying
i
would
drink
this
again
d
super
drinkable
very
high
drinkability
this
is
the
epitome
of
an
autumn
beverage
not
bad
at
all
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
the
flavor
isnt
powerful
but
is
plentiful
good
and
smooth
delicious
beer
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
this
could
be
my
fall
go
to
beer
im
not
saying
its
the
perfect
brown
but
its
just
the
way
i
like
my
brown
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
hint
of
toffee
and
some
nutty
flavors
hop
bitterness
is
more
to
balance
the
beer
than
to
add
to
the
complexity
medium
bodied
unlike
other
browns
ales
sierra
nevada
tumbler
has
that
crisp
hoppy
flavor
sn
is
famous
for
upfront
the
hops
are
assertive
but
dont
interfere
with
enjoyment
of
the
malts
as
you
swallow
your
tongue
gets
the
chance
to
start
tasting
the
lightly
roasted
malt
and
caramel
sweetness
it
tastes
faintly
chocolately
with
just
a
bit
of
nuttiness
that
combines
well
with
the
grapefruit
hop
flavor
this
can
be
a
complex
beer
if
you
want
to
drink
it
slowly
and
pick
it
apart
but
its
also
well
balanced
and
easy
to
enjoy
without
thinking
too
hard
not
impressed
completely
lackluster
the
hop
is
really
bleh
drinkability
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
since
it
lacks
any
overpowering
flavors
the
brew
seems
to
be
intended
for
crisp
fall
evenings
excellent
for
this
time
of
year
i
saw
this
strolling
through
the
supermarket
isle
and
how
i
like
the
good
things
i
jump
in
it
2010
edition
premiere
year
last
sixer
they
had
left
on
the
shelf
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
yields
a
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
pours
into
a
trusty
ale
receptacle
to
a
dark
root
beer
colour
with
a
foamy
multisized
bubble
head
taste
first
preceded
by
a
notable
mouthfeel
carbonated
and
with
substantial
density
the
taste
then
kicks
in
with
a
very
roasted
and
smoky
maltiness
the
smoke
is
as
fresh
as
if
you
are
standing
next
to
a
bonfire
after
the
malt
belt
there
is
a
noble
bitterness
that
is
more
chaulky
and
dry
than
bitter
the
bitterness
then
increases
and
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
a
good
brew
with
flavor
belt
with
a
relatively
clean
finish
on
the
end
this
as
all
of
snb
brews
is
unique
in
itself
and
highly
drinkable
i
see
new
beer
from
snb
i
jump
in
it
without
hesitation
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
the
american
brown
ale
however
this
is
pretty
tasty
its
extremely
well
balanced
i
find
many
to
be
far
too
sweet
this
has
a
very
good
balance
of
sweetness
while
still
having
a
light
hop
bitterness
to
it
a
bit
of
toffee
and
grains
its
good
mouthfeel
is
phenomenal
rich
and
creamy
its
quite
thick
and
chewy
without
going
over
the
top
nice
autumn
beer
the
body
was
very
nice
smooth
full
wellrounded
and
easy
drinkability
was
also
good
the
beer
went
down
easily
overall
a
decent
beer
if
nothing
special
the
biggest
surprise
was
that
sn
restrained
themselves
from
making
yet
another
hop
bomb
like
most
of
their
brews
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
not
heavy
at
all
dont
let
the
color
fool
you
this
one
will
pair
fine
with
eating
6
lbs
of
food
at
thanksgiving
had
this
on
tap
at
il
vicino
in
santa
fe
as
their
house
beers
were
unavailable
due
to
reconstruction
of
their
brewery
turns
out
this
beer
is
spot
on
for
a
fall
seasonal
and
very
food
friendly
lovely
dark
brown
colour
with
highlights
and
a
caramel
nose
with
hops
in
the
mix
this
is
a
big
brown
ale
with
a
rounded
mouthfeel
and
a
long
finish
sn
should
just
keep
this
in
their
lineup
as
a
brown
ale
year
round
ive
found
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
one
since
its
release
in
august
tumbler
pours
into
a
glass
a
brownish
auburn
color
with
an
off
white
layer
of
head
which
has
pretty
good
retention
and
light
lacing
it
has
a
very
nice
aroma
with
all
of
the
roasted
malts
making
themselves
known
along
with
some
cocoa
and
nutty
scents
evident
as
well
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
the
roasted
malt
qualities
come
through
upfront
with
slightly
bitterchocolate
notes
which
are
followed
by
a
smooth
and
caramel
finish
this
is
a
really
well
balanced
brew
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
at
the
end
and
i
find
it
to
be
delightfully
drinkable
it
leaves
a
lingering
creaminess
on
the
tongue
that
begs
for
another
glassful
maybe
i
should
buy
a
case
of
this
one
not
surprised
that
sierra
nevada
has
another
winner
on
their
hands
here
perfect
for
the
kind
of
weather
the
label
suggests
all
in
all
i
would
and
will
continue
to
purchase
tumbler
autumn
brown
ale
as
long
as
it
is
in
stores
was
enthusiastic
about
this
newer
beer
as
i
am
both
a
fan
of
the
brewery
and
the
style
it
really
wasnt
my
favorite
interpretation
of
the
style
but
was
still
enjoyable
and
a
good
beer
for
a
crisp
fall
night
with
some
playoff
baseball
and
chili
since
kellerweis
came
out
ive
been
looking
forward
to
anything
new
from
sierra
nevada
this
doesnt
disappoint
im
reminded
of
surly
bender
and
ithaca
nut
brown
for
the
tasty
drinkability
the
aroma
is
a
bit
like
a
light
coffee
roast
with
toffee
and
cherries
theres
a
mix
of
roasted
grains
cocoa
smoke
nutty
malts
and
a
touch
of
caramel
candy
in
the
flavor
the
finish
has
mild
citrus
rind
taste
with
a
clean
bitterness
that
matches
nicely
with
roasted
grains
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
end
for
the
style
and
i
like
that
its
sessionable
when
so
many
brown
ales
are
heavy
and
filling
toasty
malt
aroma
with
chocolate
full
toasted
to
roasted
malt
flavor
with
hop
bitterness
in
finish
to
balance
medium
to
full
bodied
but
a
creamy
texture
makes
this
drinkable
i
prefer
this
style
over
octoberfest
the
flavor
was
much
hoppier
than
expected
as
well
but
given
the
fact
that
this
is
from
sn
thats
not
all
that
surprising
light
caramel
notes
finish
was
faintly
bitter
and
earthy
the
mouth
was
moderately
full
good
carbonation
easily
drinkable
pint
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
final
thoughts
two
thumbs
up
would
certainly
buy
another
6
pack
of
this
is
i
can
find
it
very
nice
fallwinter
beer
cheers
to
sierra
nevada
definitely
one
of
the
best
in
their
lineup
the
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
with
some
toffee
notes
but
it
is
fairly
faint
and
certainly
less
than
i
would
like
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
notes
of
toffee
caramel
chocolate
and
some
earthy
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
great
switch
up
for
sn
they
just
broadened
their
range
a
solid
brown
for
sure
its
odd
that
the
milky
qualities
would
be
those
that
carried
across
the
whole
beer
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
has
the
weight
of
milk
tempered
by
a
mild
astringency
that
peaks
in
the
middle
of
a
draught
and
fades
out
at
the
end
to
let
sweetness
and
nuts
handle
the
finish
feels
good
to
drink
and
i
had
no
trouble
putting
this
one
away
ive
always
been
partial
to
brown
ales
and
i
may
make
a
habit
of
this
one
overall
this
beer
didnt
disappoint
i
thought
it
would
be
much
hoppier
but
sierra
nevada
did
their
best
to
stay
true
to
the
style
and
created
what
i
consider
a
gem
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
and
hope
to
enjoy
it
again
in
the
near
future
dark
mahogany
appearance
tan
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
roasted
malt
aroma
earthy
with
a
touch
of
hop
character
tastes
of
more
roasted
malt
slight
caramel
and
a
lingering
smoke
flavor
a
great
brown
ale
superb
maltiness
a
great
one
for
just
about
any
meal
tumbler
i
like
the
name
is
a
light
brown
color
resembling
a
brown
ale
that
was
simple
enough
on
top
a
tan
head
arose
than
diminished
into
some
sparse
bubbles
a
bit
of
stickage
to
the
sides
smell
is
toasted
malts
nuts
toasted
qualities
and
not
alot
of
hopping
just
some
earthiness
in
the
back
taste
is
a
light
brown
pretty
simple
toast
and
the
like
with
nuts
and
some
small
sugar
sweetness
not
all
that
large
caramel
feel
is
thin
and
approaching
watery
but
not
quite
there
carb
is
on
the
low
side
not
very
lively
on
the
mouth
im
not
a
brown
ale
type
of
guy
but
this
remains
drinkable
i
could
have
two
or
so
a
simple
style
from
a
brewery
who
knows
how
to
nail
down
a
style
a
good
one
to
give
to
somebody
new
to
craft
beer
notes
disappointing
showing
for
sam
adams
the
balance
on
this
beer
was
all
out
of
wack
i
was
surprised
i
hadnt
seen
this
beer
before
i
had
a
sixteen
ounce
draft
of
this
at
rattle
n
hum
who
were
featuring
this
brewer
during
new
york
craft
beer
week
im
not
a
big
fan
of
brown
ales
and
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
either
a
little
more
carbonated
than
i
expected
and
a
little
light
on
flavor
and
aroma
if
you
like
brown
ales
i
think
youll
like
this
one
but
im
the
wrong
person
to
ask
d
really
tasty
and
wildly
sessionable
a
fine
followup
to
new
seasonals
from
sierra
nevada
kellerweis
torpedo
now
this
plus
a
bounty
of
excellent
30th
anniversary
beers
im
noticing
whats
going
on
down
in
chico
and
i
like
it
a
lot
already
have
polished
off
a
couple
sixpacks
in
the
last
month
and
guarantee
more
will
meet
the
same
fate
recommended
a
pretty
typical
brown
ale
quite
enjoyable
within
its
context
i
would
have
again
while
this
wasnt
heaveable
it
was
hardly
good
took
a
little
work
getting
it
all
down
and
i
only
started
off
with
a
halfpint
id
consider
trying
this
again
but
only
on
tap
at
happy
hour
i
didnt
know
about
this
one
till
i
saw
it
on
sale
at
the
local
riteaid
for
13
99
a
twelve
pack
i
love
their
pale
ale
it
was
my
first
craft
brew
that
i
ever
had
so
i
thought
id
give
this
one
a
whirl
brownish
amber
with
a
soapy
whitish
head
leaves
some
decent
lacing
smells
of
burnt
caramel
and
toast
lots
of
roasted
malts
caramel
and
a
good
deal
of
hops
on
the
taste
it
has
that
sierra
nevada
taste
good
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
good
sessionable
bear
ill
definately
look
for
this
one
next
fall
d
fits
nicely
in
the
sierra
nevada
family
of
brews
has
qualities
that
are
similar
to
their
torpedo
pale
ale
a
great
seasonal
release
and
great
addition
to
the
brown
ales
available
in
ca
nice
mid
bodied
mouthfeel
goes
down
nicely
but
at
5
5
thats
about
what
i
would
expect
so
glad
to
see
a
nice
low
abv
beer
thats
tasty
without
being
hoppy
enough
to
melt
you
teethnot
that
there
anything
wrong
with
hop
bombs
this
is
the
best
brown
ale
i
have
had
and
one
of
the
best
beers
period
kudos
to
you
sierra
nevada
the
beer
is
rich
medium
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
the
smell
is
toasted
bread
and
the
taste
is
also
predominantly
toasted
grain
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
and
the
finish
is
a
nice
balance
of
crisp
and
dry
for
me
this
is
another
instance
of
sierra
nevada
taking
a
style
of
beer
and
doing
it
noticeably
better
than
the
standard
among
notyetsuperserious
beer
aficionados
newcastle
is
the
standard
brown
ale
tumbler
is
clearly
better
than
newcastle
grabbed
a
sixer
of
these
cause
sierra
nevada
rarely
goes
wrong
this
was
a
solid
brown
lots
of
standard
caramel
maltiness
with
a
fruity
hop
presence
as
well
nuts
and
slight
earthiness
a
touch
of
roastiness
but
not
a
stoutknockoff
body
is
medium
light
with
fairly
high
carbonation
highly
drinkable
could
be
a
session
brew
one
id
grab
again
a
good
example
of
the
style
5
50
only
on
the
bottle
its
there
but
youll
hardly
feel
it
as
one
of
these
gets
popped
open
and
enjoyed
during
the
changing
of
the
leaves
i
cant
say
not
to
try
this
but
if
there
are
a
lot
of
fall
and
octoberfest
beers
available
where
this
is
found
then
you
might
want
to
see
what
else
is
out
there
this
can
only
be
recommended
for
the
diehard
sn
fan
a
goodlooking
medium
brown
brew
with
a
frothy
light
tan
head
and
good
carbonation
aroma
is
light
an
nutty
flavor
is
deep
and
malty
probably
more
so
than
i
expected
well
done
a
very
fine
quality
brown
ale
i
have
had
better
and
i
have
had
worse
but
this
is
fairly
drinkable
with
a
light
fizzy
finish
cool
label
great
autumn
vibe
drink
well
my
friends
mouthfeel
was
great
for
a
brown
ale
very
solid
but
not
heavy
excellent
highly
drinkable
fall
beer
d
not
a
bad
session
ale
had
i
gone
into
this
looking
for
a
hop
bomb
of
a
brown
id
love
it
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
malty
beverage
ill
have
to
revisit
this
when
im
in
the
mood
for
an
ipa
an
excellent
brown
ale
and
an
awesome
fall
seasonal
sierra
nevada
never
fails
to
impress
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
but
dont
judge
a
beer
by
its
cover
i
might
be
somewhat
uneducated
regarding
brown
ales
but
this
ale
has
the
taste
of
burnt
bacon
with
a
pungent
aroma
i
have
always
been
very
impressed
with
sn
but
this
comes
up
short
still
a
brewery
that
others
should
aspire
to
reach
but
i
will
stick
with
pale
ale
and
torpedo
until
the
celebration
ale
comes
out
edit
26
bottles
in
the
sixer
had
this
happen
the
rest
were
the
same
as
above
without
the
poop
smell
solid
brown
ale
from
sn
just
nutty
enough
to
give
you
a
real
sense
that
fall
is
in
the
air
but
not
overwhelming
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
wheteher
during
the
afternoon
bbq
or
a
quiet
cool
fall
evening
of
relaxing
great
offering
but
would
any
less
be
expected
from
sn
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
a
surprisingly
more
stoutlike
character
than
a
typical
brown
drinkability
this
brew
definitely
gets
me
ready
for
autumn
i
really
like
this
beer
very
solid
im
not
one
to
sit
and
drink
beer
after
beer
during
the
evening
but
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
be
quite
satisfied
from
sierra
nevada
a
bit
more
flavor
was
anticipated
but
this
was
a
good
one
nonetheless
drinkability
sessionable
at
5
5
not
boosy
would
order
again
under
limited
options
not
a
bad
beer
however
easily
forgotten
im
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
this
one
but
if
offered
ill
definitely
drink
it
notes
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
well
made
american
brown
ale
and
a
good
autumn
release
i
can
see
this
beer
pairing
well
with
some
of
the
hardier
fall
seasonal
foods
d
id
rather
a
brown
with
more
malt
and
less
hop
but
this
one
is
not
offensive
i
could
session
this
one
easily
if
given
the
opportunity
very
solid
and
tasty
a
good
effort
here
drinkability
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
cool
autumn
day
watching
the
leaves
very
nice
fall
brew
d
i
need
to
give
this
another
try
d
great
brew
one
of
my
new
favorite
browns
fits
perfect
with
the
season
d
a
great
drinking
brown
ale
that
is
perfect
for
the
fall
well
done
sierra
nevada
the
aroma
is
nice
and
smooth
with
light
roasted
malt
and
brown
sugar
flavor
is
smooth
as
well
with
a
nice
round
nutty
and
malty
flavor
carbonation
is
low
and
mouthfeel
is
on
the
dry
side
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
sierra
nevada
batting
average
999
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
other
brown
ales
that
i
would
choose
first
overall
a
superb
brew
an
all
around
nice
brown
ale
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
result
is
a
very
drinkable
american
brown
ale
good
job
good
drinkability
nice
session
beer
d
after
reading
all
the
reviews
of
this
thing
i
was
not
too
anxious
to
try
it
however
i
must
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
and
tasty
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
d
overall
sierra
nevada
tumbler
is
just
about
everything
i
am
looking
for
in
a
fall
seasonal
not
too
light
not
too
heavy
and
a
good
dose
of
malt
recommended
nutty
malts
with
equal
citus
flavor
gives
it
a
unique
taste
for
this
style
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
could
down
several
in
a
sitting
a
dense
massive
tan
head
tops
the
brown
brew
streaks
of
crimson
pierce
where
the
light
hits
retention
is
excellent
and
thick
sheets
of
slightly
broken
lace
are
left
when
all
is
done
smells
nutty
with
a
big
malty
sweetness
in
the
background
has
a
good
mix
of
hops
and
malts
on
the
palate
but
the
hops
outweigh
in
the
end
very
faint
notes
of
pine
spice
and
dried
dark
fruits
exist
pretty
dry
for
a
brown
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
this
definitely
an
sn
brown
the
distinctive
hop
presence
proves
it
notes
i
tend
to
prefer
more
maltforward
brown
ales
but
i
have
to
admit
that
although
its
hoppy
this
beer
is
well
balanced
i
would
recommend
it
to
fans
of
brooklyn
brown
avery
new
world
porter
or
even
cascadian
dark
ales
i
probably
wont
buy
another
6pack
but
i
might
get
a
pint
sometime
depending
on
the
available
selection
moreys
bottom
line
a
bit
more
tame
and
watered
down
than
i
expected
from
such
a
bold
brewery
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
that
being
said
if
youre
into
brown
ales
its
worth
a
shot
tumbler
is
an
interesting
release
from
sierra
nevada
its
probably
one
of
their
more
straight
forward
releases
much
like
glissade
while
it
isnt
a
bad
brown
ale
its
hardly
a
stand
out
i
like
the
flavor
but
nothing
about
it
really
stands
out
having
said
that
theres
nothing
overtly
bad
about
it
either
ultimately
it
needs
a
little
something
to
spice
it
up
perhaps
more
hops
would
do
the
trick
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
another
nice
release
from
sierra
nevada
definitely
worth
a
try
something
of
a
northern
english
brown
though
im
left
wanting
more
flavor
more
of
an
indian
summer
ale
than
a
more
substantive
offering
for
the
arrival
of
fall
rather
a
poor
value
too
i
paid
10
for
the
sixer
taste
is
nice
caramel
malts
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
the
sweetness
fairly
medium
body
beer
is
decently
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
d
very
drinkable
a
solid
choice
for
a
session
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
clean
brown
ale
with
not
too
much
sweetness
not
too
much
smoke
lots
of
balance
and
lots
of
malt
tumbler
delivers
it
wasnt
really
to
my
tastes
but
it
wasnt
bad
either
impression
sierra
nevada
another
fine
beer
from
the
original
and
still
best
innovator
get
this
drink
this
im
not
much
a
brown
ale
person
this
is
one
of
the
nicer
ones
ive
come
across
for
my
tastes
recommended
really
impressed
overall
i
wont
have
a
newky
for
a
long
time
thats
for
sure
d
lots
of
flavor
great
balance
interesting
profile
for
a
brown
ale
and
a
reasonable
abv
id
grab
more
but
its
all
sold
out
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
until
next
year
the
feel
is
pretty
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
is
well
balanced
with
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
a
fantastic
fall
beer
this
may
be
my
favorite
brown
ale
d
fairly
disappointed
with
this
offering
as
i
had
high
hopes
for
it
the
nasty
metallic
taste
was
thoroughly
offputting
and
ruined
the
rest
of
the
drink
ill
drink
the
rest
of
the
6pack
but
only
after
my
palates
already
destroyed
d
a
great
sunsetevening
beer
especially
as
the
sun
sets
earlier
each
day
in
my
opinion
a
bit
too
thin
and
airy
to
be
a
bedtime
hour
beer
on
chilly
nights
but
all
in
all
a
solid
product
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
lacks
some
character
and
complexity
i
could
have
a
couple
because
it
is
fairly
smooth
but
nothing
id
load
up
on
either
still
this
is
probably
pretty
good
with
end
of
the
year
bbq
fare
blackened
meat
comfort
foods
etc
probably
great
with
a
hot
sandwich
pastrami
etc
and
because
of
this
it
get
a
bump
to
3
5
i
could
do
a
couple
of
these
a
really
nice
autumn
beer
for
sure
doesnt
seem
like
a
brown
ale
to
me
not
that
it
really
matters
worth
a
shot
if
youre
looking
for
a
fall
brew
i
feel
this
beer
is
right
on
style
while
not
the
top
of
the
heap
brown
ale
wise
its
damn
good
and
the
price
was
right
tumbler
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
overall
dogfish
head
probably
has
the
best
fall
seasonal
in
punkin
that
ive
had
so
far
still
this
is
pretty
good
and
its
pretty
drinkable
d
a
smooth
very
tasty
and
easy
beer
to
drink
this
is
slowly
becoming
my
go
to
fall
beer
highly
recommended
a
tasty
brew
but
nothing
too
complex
it
does
stand
out
amongst
the
autumn
seasonal
releases
as
being
something
pleasantly
different
drinkability
this
is
a
really
good
brown
ale
got
this
sixer
for
6
99
and
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
and
tried
it
not
to
fond
of
this
beer
actually
overall
but
i
give
it
credit
for
what
its
worth
drinkability
for
a
brown
ale
its
characteristics
stand
out
more
than
expected
the
slight
bitter
spiciness
combined
with
a
clean
finish
give
it
a
slight
edge
bring
on
fall
sausages
and
football
solid
brown
ale
that
pours
a
coopery
amber
color
1
finger
of
white
head
with
a
limited
bit
of
lacing
hanging
around
the
glass
nice
caramel
malt
flavor
with
a
finish
that
kind
of
sits
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
has
a
bit
of
alcohol
that
i
was
not
expecting
from
a
brown
at
5
5
but
all
in
all
a
solid
beer
its
not
a
mindblowing
beer
but
its
pleasant
theres
something
that
just
seems
comforting
about
it
maybe
its
the
pastoral
picture
and
autumn
colors
on
the
six
pack
i
dunno
but
it
works
for
me
toasted
grains
and
a
little
tannic
bitterness
up
front
caramel
and
cookie
dough
malts
midpalate
light
sweetness
and
some
woodiness
flinty
smokiness
near
the
finish
joined
by
some
woody
herbal
hop
bitterness
lingering
caramel
moderate
body
with
a
lively
feel
wouldnt
mind
it
being
a
bit
creamier
appearance
is
a
dark
hazy
brown
with
a
half
inch
head
that
dissipates
slowly
and
steadily
it
smells
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
sweetness
you
can
immediately
taste
the
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
sweetness
i
almost
wanna
say
there
is
a
slight
cocoa
hint
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
nothing
extraordinary
it
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
carbonation
on
the
light
side
drinkability
is
quite
high
goes
down
easy
and
is
perfectly
balanced
i
know
it
says
so
on
the
label
but
i
could
definitely
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
chilly
fall
day
sierra
nevada
has
never
let
me
down
try
one
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
with
a
very
nice
head
and
huge
curtains
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
earthy
and
physical
with
a
high
note
of
chocolately
malt
the
flavor
is
chocolately
and
slightly
smokey
all
malt
here
there
is
dark
caramel
and
cherry
like
sitting
around
a
warm
fire
with
a
pipe
of
rich
tobacco
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
solid
pours
dark
brown
boardering
on
black
mostly
opaque
with
just
the
faintest
hint
of
red
when
held
to
the
light
modest
half
inch
of
light
brown
head
looks
very
much
like
a
porter
or
stout
very
nice
clean
dry
toasted
malt
smell
the
taste
is
also
clean
and
malty
a
touch
of
nutty
sweetness
with
a
little
bit
of
a
smokey
note
finishes
with
a
very
modest
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
im
convinced
that
it
is
imposible
for
seirra
nevada
to
make
a
bad
beer
this
didnt
blow
my
mind
to
say
the
least
but
it
is
still
a
pretty
tasty
offering
good
flavor
drinks
easy
and
captures
the
season
well
not
a
masterpiece
but
good
drinks
really
easy
i
will
have
to
look
at
my
review
see
how
this
compares
to
the
old
harvest
brown
or
whatever
it
was
called
but
at
first
blush
id
say
i
like
this
better
seems
to
have
deeper
malt
backbone
just
looked
im
wrong
still
a
keeper
imo
overall
a
solid
rendition
of
the
style
id
want
something
with
a
little
more
brown
sugar
on
the
aftertaste
but
sierra
nevada
has
done
well
here
i
am
a
big
fan
of
sierra
nevada
and
this
one
didnt
disappoint
a
good
brown
ale
is
perfect
for
autumn
so
i
think
they
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
not
only
is
this
beer
perfect
for
the
season
its
also
a
great
brown
ale
in
general
it
isnt
as
heavy
as
a
dfh
indian
brown
ale
or
palo
santo
marron
or
a
samuel
smith
nut
brown
ale
and
also
isnt
as
high
in
alcohol
content
which
makes
it
very
drinkable
yet
maintaining
all
of
that
great
maltiness
that
we
love
about
brown
ales
this
is
a
great
beer
to
kick
back
on
a
patio
or
deck
and
watch
the
leaves
come
down
a
moderate
head
dissipates
almost
completely
producing
the
aroma
of
roasted
malts
followed
by
hops
the
beer
nicely
balances
flavors
of
roasted
malts
faint
and
slightly
sweet
chocolate
and
a
healthy
dose
of
hops
the
beer
is
light
on
the
palate
and
is
overall
a
highly
drinkable
session
beer
great
for
fall
tailgating
or
any
coolweather
festivities
overall
this
is
a
very
good
balanced
brown
ale
that
is
quite
hoppier
than
most
other
browns
that
i
have
tried
rogue
hazelnut
brown
nectar
remains
1
for
me
but
this
is
still
very
good
and
worth
seeking
out
this
fall
pours
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
foamy
two
finger
offwhite
head
fades
to
a
quarter
inch
leaving
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
smell
toasty
nutty
brown
sugar
yeasty
bread
hops
are
green
and
earthy
but
quite
faint
taste
toasty
nutty
really
mild
roast
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
a
sizable
earthy
hopping
hops
and
yeast
flavors
come
together
in
a
somewhat
tangy
mildly
bitter
finish
feel
is
a
bit
thin
a
fairly
laid
back
brown
ale
not
my
preference
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
bottled
82610
not
that
familiar
with
the
american
brown
ale
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
sierra
nevada
porter
which
ill
have
to
try
again
soon
to
contrast
my
suspicion
is
there
is
a
similar
roasted
malt
in
both
has
a
nice
head
which
dissipates
not
much
lacing
good
dark
amber
coloration
nicely
carbonated
with
a
hoppy
then
smooth
finish
i
like
this
beer
more
with
each
sip
overall
another
solid
effort
from
sn
thanks
drinkable
but
a
little
more
bitter
coffee
and
chocolate
like
for
the
style
i
think
it
is
a
lot
like
a
watery
porter
rather
than
a
brown
i
make
it
an
ordinary
fall
seasonal
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wonderful
dry
roasted
malt
scent
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
and
a
moderate
hop
nose
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
bitter
hop
bite
up
front
with
plenty
of
roasted
malt
flavor
to
balance
it
goes
down
smooth
and
dry
with
a
bit
of
caramel
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
hop
character
is
exceptional
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
its
damn
near
a
perfect
american
brown
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
looks
like
the
autumn
brown
ale
it
is
think
fall
maple
leafs
and
you
get
the
color
a
nice
head
lacing
sits
a
top
the
brown
nectar
the
nose
is
bouquet
of
malty
spiciness
chocolate
hazelnut
ect
ect
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
above
average
i
think
the
real
thing
that
sets
this
beer
apart
is
the
wonderful
balance
the
drinkablility
of
this
beer
is
exceptional
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
the
brown
ale
but
this
is
an
exception
drinkability
a
smooth
pleasant
easily
drinkable
brown
ale
for
the
record
ive
purchased
two
6packs
to
date
and
anticipate
a
third
one
this
week
dnot
a
session
beer
but
i
could
see
consuming
quite
a
bit
of
this
during
the
fall
season
if
we
had
a
fall
season
in
this
god
forsaken
state
of
arizona
but
i
imagine
it
looks
like
the
cute
little
picture
on
the
bottle
other
comments
pretty
exemplary
brown
ale
just
not
my
favorite
kind
of
beer
great
session
brown
ale
this
beer
does
not
have
the
most
flavor
but
is
a
nice
malty
brown
ale
without
being
overly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
lacking
enough
carbonation
it
has
that
sn
house
flavor
that
there
beers
have
there
is
no
doubt
it
is
a
sn
beer
i
would
prefer
dfh
indian
brown
ale
to
this
for
a
brown
with
more
flavor
but
this
beer
is
pretty
good
d
if
im
gonna
go
for
a
fall
beer
im
gonna
want
something
with
a
little
more
flavor
this
is
a
little
light
for
my
tastes
one
finger
offwhitealmost
light
tan
head
quick
dissipation
with
a
substantial
layer
of
head
retained
on
top
of
amber
brown
clear
body
numerous
trails
of
carbonation
rising
from
bottom
of
glass
pretty
complex
malty
nose
roast
a
bit
fruity
and
a
wee
bit
of
smoke
taste
mirrors
the
nose
with
added
attributes
of
grassy
and
floral
hops
not
much
bitterness
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
pretty
good
effervescence
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
i
do
recognize
its
smoothness
and
high
drinkability
a
finely
crafted
beer
for
an
cool
autumn
evening
drinkability
good
the
thin
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
when
looking
at
the
brews
appearance
it
is
an
easy
drinking
very
sessionable
brown
that
will
not
offend
at
all
good
brew
though
great
seasonable
offering
will
look
forward
to
purchasing
every
fall
a
cant
miss
brown
ale
as
i
get
into
my
second
trial
this
seems
a
good
fit
for
autumn
and
its
just
big
enough
to
help
with
the
nip
in
the
air
i
expected
a
bigger
hop
profile
especially
considering
its
a
sn
beer
but
this
will
do
just
fine
this
brew
pours
brilliantly
clear
medium
brown
with
rubycopper
highlights
and
a
clingy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
mediumhigh
malt
nutty
and
sweet
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
just
a
bit
of
roast
the
flavor
is
moderately
malty
and
a
bit
sweet
quite
nutty
and
some
biscuit
flavor
the
swallow
brings
a
balancing
hop
bitterness
accented
by
a
slightly
dry
finish
the
carbonation
and
body
are
both
medium
overall
a
flavorful
malty
beer
with
a
pleasantly
dry
finish
and
very
drinkable
priced
very
reasonably
at
about
7
for
6
pours
a
clear
brown
with
everlasting
offwhite
head
malty
aroma
of
hops
slight
mint
cocoa
some
ash
and
sweets
cocoa
sweetness
leads
to
hop
backbone
malty
toffee
slight
spice
cinnamon
dry
subtle
choco
notes
come
through
at
the
finish
medium
bodied
brew
with
medium
carb
that
tickles
the
palate
another
classic
offering
from
nevad
a
fall
sessionable
beer
that
i
will
be
grabbing
more
than
once
drinkability
is
relatively
high
the
beer
is
sessionable
and
the
flavor
profile
is
appealing
enough
to
consume
with
ease
yet
not
require
much
thinking
from
the
drinker
seems
like
a
solid
beer
to
me
d
although
the
carbonation
can
get
annoying
with
too
many
of
these
its
still
very
refreshing
and
pleasing
to
drink
and
i
could
definitely
have
1
or
2
more
goes
pretty
well
with
food
and
is
great
to
just
have
around
if
youre
looking
to
relax
not
too
expensive
either
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
to
but
if
this
is
representative
of
brown
ale
as
a
style
i
will
try
many
more
in
the
future
as
i
love
the
malt
and
the
sweetness
dark
brown
smells
like
a
porter
and
when
it
warms
a
bit
it
starts
to
have
some
coffee
smells
the
taste
has
the
same
as
the
smell
except
with
a
nice
earthy
bite
from
the
hops
at
the
end
its
a
pretty
standard
brown
ale
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
do
like
it
for
the
style
especially
because
of
the
nice
hop
bite
in
the
back
only
downfall
is
that
the
body
is
just
a
little
bit
watery
but
not
enough
at
all
to
take
away
from
the
quality
of
this
fine
californian
beer
other
than
that
i
liked
this
one
d
its
easily
drinkable
with
no
offensive
flavors
but
it
just
falls
short
in
the
flavor
department
a
bit
watery
overall
which
was
really
unexpected
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
34
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
nut
hint
of
earthy
malt
hops
hint
of
roasted
malt
slight
oatmeal
and
slight
yeast
fits
the
style
of
an
american
brown
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
dry
hops
nuts
sweet
malt
and
hint
of
yeast
overall
great
aroma
and
appearance
but
lacking
in
body
dit
goes
down
easy
but
really
does
not
offer
much
brown
ales
are
one
of
my
favourite
styles
when
the
weather
gets
cold
but
this
really
falls
flat
a
disappointment
from
a
great
brewery
d
high
for
such
a
dark
style
this
is
clearly
sessionable
d
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
for
what
it
is
not
quite
sessionable
for
me
but
a
nice
fall
drinker
for
sure
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
hop
bite
to
support
a
mellow
roasted
coffee
malt
flavor
but
it
is
a
bit
watery
in
the
taste
as
the
beer
opens
up
a
bit
the
finish
of
full
hops
is
nice
drinkability
its
a
decent
tasting
fall
beer
and
i
could
stare
longingly
into
its
label
all
day
long
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
this
on
a
blustery
fall
day
no
problem
overall
this
is
a
great
american
brown
ale
probably
the
second
best
i
have
had
next
to
rogues
hazelnut
brown
nectar
but
it
is
still
an
american
brown
ale
not
a
whole
lot
to
get
excited
about
here
but
a
nice
easy
drinking
fall
beer
nonetheless
notes
a
nice
brown
ale
from
sn
at
first
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
i
knew
it
would
be
decently
hoppy
but
i
wasnt
sure
how
it
would
compare
to
other
hoppy
brown
ales
it
ends
up
being
along
the
lines
of
dfh
india
brown
hoppy
but
with
a
lot
of
roastiness
too
appearance
is
a
deep
clear
mahogany
with
a
foamy
tan
head
head
recedes
slowly
leaving
some
nice
lacing
aroma
is
malty
chocolaty
and
toasty
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
nice
and
unexpected
hop
bit
that
pops
up
in
the
middle
the
roasty
malty
character
up
front
was
as
good
as
expected
and
the
hops
really
set
this
apart
from
your
run
of
the
mill
brown
ale
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
about
what
you
would
expect
for
the
style
drikability
is
pretty
high
with
this
one
too
bought
this
on
a
whim
at
the
last
minute
and
am
real
glad
i
did
i
give
this
a
low
score
on
drinkability
which
probably
drops
the
grade
half
a
letter
i
dont
want
to
drink
much
of
this
i
dont
know
that
ill
drink
this
again
which
is
upsetting
because
i
wanted
to
love
this
beer
this
is
not
a
lets
knock
back
a
case
of
these
amber
its
more
of
a
sit
and
sip
amber
a
great
tasting
beer
thats
perfect
for
when
you
want
something
flavorful
without
all
the
abv
i
really
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
theres
something
about
it
that
fills
you
up
and
doesnt
leave
you
wanting
a
whole
lot
more
d
good
brew
i
think
that
this
could
be
a
great
session
choice
for
an
alternative
to
the
autumn
regulars
very
toasted
texture
throughout
with
the
right
carbonation
its
consistent
and
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
tasty
this
beer
pours
a
nice
medium
brown
that
looks
fairly
dark
in
a
sufficiently
thick
glass
the
head
is
beige
and
creamy
and
readily
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mild
pineyfloral
hops
mixed
with
nutty
caramel
malt
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
with
some
gentle
hop
bitterness
and
more
touches
of
chocolatey
malt
than
i
got
from
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
for
the
abv
tumbler
hits
the
notes
that
im
looking
for
in
a
brown
stout
its
easydrinking
with
a
nutty
malt
flavor
and
not
too
much
hops
that
said
id
prefer
even
less
hop
flavorbitterness
and
more
nuttiness
relative
to
caramel
and
im
not
really
sure
that
id
order
a
second
glass
i
like
the
sweetness
but
its
probably
a
bit
much
for
some
good
beer
but
perhaps
a
little
forgettable
tumbler
welcome
to
the
sn
seasonals
a
servicable
beer
that
fills
the
gap
in
sns
portfolio
of
beers
finely
the
beer
is
smooth
good
mediumfull
body
with
a
creamy
feel
from
a
carbonation
level
the
only
real
complaint
is
that
yeast
spice
on
the
finish
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
in
a
brown
ale
to
me
it
is
almost
a
bit
too
harsh
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
one
that
i
would
remember
da
good
american
brown
ale
but
not
quite
robust
enough
pours
chestnut
brown
with
a
tall
puffy
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
thin
cap
but
not
much
lacing
classic
brown
ale
aromas
with
bready
malt
a
touch
of
toast
and
some
pine
from
the
hops
there
is
a
noticeable
grainy
sourness
as
well
sort
of
like
a
milk
stout
the
taste
is
similar
a
bit
softer
than
the
nose
would
suggest
and
the
hops
are
a
bit
more
restrained
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
creamy
and
overall
id
say
this
is
pretty
solid
not
rich
and
deep
like
some
of
the
better
browns
but
everything
is
in
the
right
place
and
it
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
d
darn
good
brew
tasty
smooth
and
easy
drinking
d
a
solid
to
fantastic
brown
ale
smooth
and
with
a
great
profile
to
boot
another
winner
from
sierra
nevada
and
perfect
for
the
fall
season
great
drinkability
my
fridge
will
be
seeing
alot
of
this
in
the
coming
years
d
this
beer
is
mostly
uninteresting
but
it
does
not
offend
the
palate
as
it
is
now
this
beer
is
easy
to
pair
with
food
but
a
richer
malt
presence
would
enhance
it
further
drinkability
a
good
brown
ale
and
a
very
good
beer
for
the
fall
this
isnt
a
favorite
of
mine
but
ill
definitely
be
looking
forward
to
this
one
when
its
out
again
next
fall
not
my
cup
of
tea
its
ok
but
nothing
im
interested
in
drinking
again
there
are
great
brewing
companies
that
cater
to
hop
heads
stone
lagunitas
and
then
others
that
can
do
that
but
will
still
brew
to
style
when
appropriate
great
lakes
goose
island
founders
this
beer
and
its
brewing
company
sits
uncomfortably
in
the
middle
not
really
knowing
what
to
do
imo
pours
dark
brown
nearly
opaque
nice
finger
worth
head
lacing
is
sufficient
maybe
its
my
congestion
but
aroma
seemed
weak
mouthfeel
is
decent
caramel
and
nutty
malt
notes
a
bit
of
citrus
hops
in
the
finish
errhhm
should
get
this
for
thanksgiving
me
thinks
might
go
real
nice
with
some
turkey
and
potatoes
and
a
pecan
pie
definitely
nutty
i
dig
this
one
maybe
not
a
goto
brown
ale
but
its
well
rounded
and
enjoyable
d
high
this
one
could
be
a
fall
favorite
around
here
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brownish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
small
roast
and
earthiness
in
the
taste
earthiness
and
a
nice
fresh
hop
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
roasty
earth
aftertaste
somewhere
between
brown
ale
and
oktoberfest
with
a
nice
hop
pours
medium
brown
with
a
touch
of
dark
amber
in
there
good
clarity
and
offwhite
head
that
was
generous
on
initial
pour
nose
is
faint
and
im
using
a
great
nosing
glass
too
palate
offers
a
dessert
like
flavor
overall
with
nuts
and
sweet
brown
baking
spices
with
a
gentle
caramel
in
there
too
light
bodied
easy
drinking
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
th
mouthfeel
and
body
have
an
unexpected
extra
carbonation
and
effervescence
i
would
like
a
little
more
solid
rich
malty
body
in
an
brownautumn
ale
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
large
head
the
smell
seemed
alittle
off
a
slight
metal
smell
the
taste
was
a
bit
heavy
full
of
flavor
and
had
some
sortta
nut
flavor
full
flavor
but
not
too
hard
to
drink
overall
a
very
enjoayble
beer
espically
for
the
fall
definitley
an
american
brown
ale
with
the
noticeable
yet
restrained
hop
profile
everything
is
balanced
and
quite
delicious
yummy
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
finishes
dry
has
a
very
earthy
feel
to
it
a
decent
beer
although
not
spectacular
brown
ales
are
typically
i
boring
style
thats
not
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
a
good
attempt
from
sn
but
ultimately
falls
short
of
making
me
want
to
drink
another
i
have
a
mixed
relationship
with
brown
ales
i
like
the
style
but
so
often
i
find
that
theyre
too
sweet
or
if
not
too
sweet
just
plain
watery
this
new
thing
from
sn
is
redeeming
however
i
cant
comment
much
on
the
color
because
i
drank
it
from
a
red
plastic
cup
but
the
head
was
a
pleasant
tan
with
many
loose
bubbles
the
aroma
was
akin
to
a
british
ale
with
oranges
and
something
that
came
close
to
those
giant
sweetarts
you
ate
as
a
kid
not
the
tiny
ones
in
the
shiny
bags
but
the
big
fat
ones
you
got
at
halloween
the
body
isnt
very
thin
thankfully
and
the
taste
is
neither
sweet
or
overly
toasted
although
theres
a
decent
flavor
of
roastiness
that
fits
with
the
theme
of
the
beer
its
nice
and
dry
at
the
end
too
without
being
hamhandedly
bitter
its
not
a
big
commitment
and
you
can
drink
more
than
one
without
too
much
wobble
and
it
goes
quite
well
with
birthday
cake
and
ice
cream
overall
a
superior
brown
ale
perfect
autumn
brew
drinkability
a
wonderful
beer
for
this
time
of
year
drinkability
on
these
babies
is
high
the
flavor
is
mild
enough
to
enjoy
over
and
over
its
not
very
filling
for
how
heavy
it
is
im
not
a
brown
ale
guy
but
ill
return
to
this
one
each
autumn
d
awesome
for
autumn
overall
others
have
noted
they
wished
more
hops
were
present
because
this
is
sn
after
all
dont
agree
with
that
at
all
this
in
my
mind
is
closer
to
a
english
brown
ale
than
american
good
indeed
this
is
a
tasty
american
brown
ale
complex
and
richly
flavored
yet
nicely
balanced
and
crisp
drinkability
a
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
brown
ale
this
is
a
style
that
i
find
difficult
to
get
excited
about
but
sierra
nevada
has
managed
to
create
and
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
one
here
notes
this
one
is
a
good
example
for
me
of
sierra
nevada
putting
their
magic
spin
on
a
typical
english
brown
ale
think
of
an
newcastle
brown
ale
with
more
flavor
nice
smooth
brown
ale
not
too
hoppy
and
plenty
of
flavor
much
smoother
on
the
mixed
gas
this
is
the
third
sierra
nevada
to
impress
me
after
not
liking
the
pale
ale
this
is
a
great
beer
to
add
to
sierras
growning
brand
across
the
u
s
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
more
d
a
nice
brown
ale
lots
of
toasted
malts
in
the
smell
and
taste
i
feel
like
this
would
be
a
great
one
to
drink
in
the
fall
as
intended
would
drink
again
good
solid
stuff
in
every
respect
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
finally
found
some
of
this
seasonal
really
looked
forward
to
sierras
take
on
a
rather
bland
ale
style
poured
great
nice
foamy
tan
colored
head
it
dies
but
leaves
a
creamy
lace
not
much
for
aroma
kind
of
light
roasted
malt
or
bread
odor
texture
reminds
me
of
a
lager
taste
is
almost
hazel
nut
like
very
mellow
roast
nothing
too
strong
here
a
better
brown
for
sure
recommended
d
this
seems
like
a
great
beer
for
autumn
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
but
one
i
would
certainly
get
again
drinkability
sierra
nevada
is
a
very
dependable
and
usually
pretty
easy
to
find
brand
that
counts
for
a
lot
the
tumbler
bottle
however
looks
a
little
like
a
thomas
kinkade
painting
that
counts
for
less
all
in
all
it
certainly
isnt
bad
it
probably
wont
knock
anybody
over
but
brown
ales
rarely
do
i
have
to
say
at
first
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
make
of
tumbler
as
i
am
used
to
more
assertive
sn
brews
also
due
to
the
fact
i
havent
been
drinking
browns
in
quite
some
time
i
may
have
forgotten
how
to
appreciate
them
tumbler
is
a
very
drinkable
and
good
beer
and
brings
back
the
appreciation
i
once
had
for
this
often
overlooked
style
a
very
satisfying
autumn
beer
definitely
reminiscent
of
the
fall
season
d
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
ale
it
actually
tasted
like
autumn
didnt
know
what
to
expect
at
purchase
but
sierra
nevada
really
perfected
this
seasonal
this
is
stays
amazingly
true
to
the
brewerys
style
why
also
staying
true
to
season
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
many
more
of
these
while
theyre
here
maybe
even
storing
some
d
a
near
sessionstyle
english
brown
made
distinctly
american
with
the
addition
of
dry
and
bittering
westcoast
hops
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
sweetness
and
body
to
welcome
cooler
months
with
enough
hop
resin
to
make
it
a
seasonlong
addition
suitable
even
for
these
waning
days
of
summer
overall
another
solid
offering
from
sierra
nevada
would
buy
again
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
the
chocolate
is
quite
different
and
pleasant
perfect
session
for
an
autumn
day
this
could
hang
out
with
long
trails
harvest
all
day
jay
all
in
all
a
solid
fall
brew
from
sn
very
well
balanced
between
malts
and
hops
make
this
a
great
sixer
to
sit
by
a
fall
bonfire
after
the
first
one
i
reviewed
i
lit
up
a
nice
maduro
and
felt
the
beer
complimented
the
cigar
quite
nicely
24oz
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
bottled
on
july
8th
pours
a
deep
brown
not
opaque
exhibits
good
carbonation
two
inches
of
lumpy
head
forms
and
quickly
dissipates
fair
amount
of
lacing
nutty
roasted
malt
on
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
notes
medium
bodied
and
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
the
mouthfeel
nice
and
easy
definitely
sessionable
sweeter
on
the
palate
the
roasted
nutty
flavors
come
across
after
those
of
semisweet
chocolate
this
is
the
best
brown
ale
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
drinkability
if
youre
sitting
around
with
your
buds
drinking
from
sixes
or
twelves
its
definitely
a
good
beer
to
consider
if
youre
looking
to
take
your
time
to
enjoy
something
after
a
long
hard
day
of
work
pour
something
else
into
your
glass
pretty
dark
brown
appearance
some
bubbles
remain
clung
to
the
glass
a
14
inch
below
surface
of
the
ale
smells
malty
and
toasted
with
a
pinch
of
hops
the
taste
is
much
less
malty
than
the
smell
and
slightly
more
hops
a
good
blend
has
a
spicy
feel
to
it
that
good
be
cleaned
up
a
little
a
good
beer
could
drink
a
six
pack
cheers
d
a
good
fall
beer
not
a
stand
out
by
any
means
but
a
welcome
addition
to
the
sierra
nevada
lineup
d
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
slight
chill
of
the
autumn
evening
i
call
this
one
a
winner
12
ounce
stubby
bottle
say
what
you
want
about
sierra
nevada
but
its
nice
to
see
the
company
not
rest
on
their
laurels
in
terms
of
the
seasonals
and
other
offerings
this
is
the
first
time
i
can
recall
them
taking
a
swing
at
a
brown
ale
pours
a
deep
brown
with
dark
ruby
undertones
that
comes
out
a
little
bit
lighter
than
the
color
of
coca
cola
large
bubbly
head
that
goes
at
least
a
half
inch
if
not
a
little
bit
higher
moderate
lacing
aroma
is
all
roasted
malt
almost
bordering
on
smokey
theres
some
dark
chocolate
fudge
notes
as
well
smells
like
a
smoked
chocolate
chip
cookie
light
and
creamy
mouthfeel
almost
like
a
cream
stout
beer
is
fairly
assertive
bitterness
levels
are
relatively
high
for
the
style
taste
is
almost
all
roasted
and
toasted
malt
kind
of
has
a
sourdough
toast
or
toasted
english
muffin
type
of
taste
to
it
theres
no
real
hop
character
save
maybe
some
light
orange
hops
in
the
finish
which
play
well
off
the
chocolate
flavors
throughout
the
body
of
the
beer
solidly
constructed
almost
like
drinking
a
porter
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
and
it
will
be
a
great
autumn
drink
if
and
when
it
finally
cools
down
outside
dvery
very
drinkable
im
so
glad
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
d
a
great
session
beer
and
great
for
just
sitting
out
on
the
porch
enjoying
one
take
your
pick
you
cant
go
wrong
here
a
decent
brew
for
those
who
like
brown
ales
personally
i
dont
care
that
much
for
brown
ales
so
i
probably
didnt
appreciate
it
as
much
as
a
brown
ale
connoisseur
would
after
several
minutes
there
is
still
a
tiny
head
and
great
lacing
like
most
selections
from
sierra
nevada
this
is
easy
to
drink
it
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
and
while
theyre
strong
theyre
not
obnoxious
or
overbearing
alcohol
is
moderate
making
this
very
drinkable
pours
a
clear
dark
maplebrown
color
with
a
medium
amount
of
head
the
smell
on
this
beer
is
kinda
nutty
and
malty
im
picking
up
very
faint
hops
but
nothing
much
a
little
wood
as
well
along
with
very
little
chocolate
there
is
nothing
bland
about
the
taste
this
beer
has
im
having
a
hard
time
pinpointing
certain
flavors
im
getting
but
this
just
isnt
watered
down
at
all
im
getting
some
chocolate
notes
some
nuttiness
a
little
roastiness
and
a
bit
of
sweet
malts
my
palate
is
not
very
advanced
on
brown
ales
so
im
not
really
sure
what
these
flavors
are
that
im
picking
up
all
i
know
is
that
it
tastes
pretty
damn
good
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
and
the
drinkability
is
not
bad
all
in
all
this
is
one
of
those
rare
brews
that
definitely
seems
to
be
as
it
claims
this
claims
to
be
an
autumn
brew
and
when
i
take
a
sip
it
reminds
me
so
so
much
of
the
taste
of
autumn
if
that
had
a
taste
good
to
try
at
least
once
if
you
like
the
autumn
brews
this
looks
almost
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
but
in
the
glass
it
appears
a
dark
mahogany
both
aroma
and
taste
are
100
roasty
but
not
in
a
coffee
or
smoky
way
and
there
is
a
nice
earthy
sweetness
the
hops
have
enough
of
a
presence
to
distinguish
this
brown
ale
from
the
more
maltforward
octoberfests
of
the
season
that
added
balance
kicks
up
the
drinkability
for
me
sierra
nevada
has
nailed
it
again
the
beer
produces
a
creamy
head
and
has
a
beautiful
deep
brown
almost
cloudy
color
theres
a
very
nice
coffeemochachocolate
aroma
the
taste
reminds
me
of
the
old
pilgrim
nutbrown
which
was
on
of
my
favorites
many
years
ago
theres
great
nuttiness
with
just
enough
bite
of
hops
on
the
finish
you
can
even
have
a
few
of
these
without
feeling
heavy
or
full
a
great
beer
for
the
fall
season
first
time
seeing
this
brew
i
thouroghly
enjoy
sierra
nevadas
brews
this
one
poured
a
cloudy
iced
tea
color
the
nose
was
dominated
buy
fresh
brewed
coffee
and
a
little
cocoa
power
the
taste
was
refreshing
of
roasted
malts
and
mocha
coffee
like
highlights
with
a
fine
balance
of
hops
and
some
walnut
a
perfect
autumn
brew
to
enjoy
with
a
nice
turkey
dinner
and
a
roaring
fire
except
not
in
florida
where
we
probably
wont
need
a
fire
pours
a
mostly
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
1
finger
beige
head
smell
is
roasted
malts
and
toffee
with
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
roasted
toffeemalts
some
spice
hops
are
present
mouth
feel
is
medium
this
is
a
autumn
brown
ale
with
earth
notes
sn
makes
great
brews
this
is
no
exception
is
the
best
brown
no
it
is
not
but
its
drinkable
affordable
and
just
plain
good
this
a
a
great
beer
for
the
fall
season
sn
has
the
best
labels
too
it
would
be
great
to
be
in
a
nice
stone
cabin
on
a
stream
in
autumn
drinking
this
beer
overall
a
splendid
west
coast
rendition
of
a
deeply
traditional
english
brown
ale
the
hops
give
this
an
added
dimension
of
brilliance
without
corrupting
the
tradition
of
the
style
i
adore
the
leather
flavor
a
bit
of
tabacco
flavor
creeps
out
as
this
ale
is
starting
to
warm
towards
room
temp
im
very
pleased
with
the
complexity
of
this
ale
great
job
sierra
nevada
ad
thank
you
eric
a
decent
session
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
was
worried
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
find
a
single
bottle
of
this
guy
call
me
a
commitaphobe
but
i
dont
wanna
commit
to
a
sixer
or
more
if
im
undecided
on
the
brew
itself
as
in
this
situation
luckily
the
fine
folks
at
the
ck
had
my
back
on
this
one
it
pours
a
clear
russet
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
brown
sugar
nutmeg
light
maple
syrup
and
a
slight
tinge
of
flowers
the
taste
holds
notes
of
nutmeg
walnuts
flowers
and
some
light
maple
syrup
simple
but
effective
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nearly
dry
finish
overall
a
tasty
straightforward
brown
a
nice
bit
o
autumnal
goodness
d
well
this
is
not
my
favorite
sn
beer
kind
of
hurt
not
worth
another
taste
the
beer
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
with
cherry
highlights
when
backlit
a
light
tan
head
forms
somewhere
between
two
and
three
fingers
in
height
and
holds
its
ground
for
a
minute
before
fading
away
lacing
is
decent
but
nothing
spectacular
nose
is
more
caramelbiscuit
than
more
roasted
aromas
like
chocolate
or
coffee
and
theres
a
bit
of
hop
aroma
at
the
end
one
of
the
nobles
if
i
had
to
guess
not
sure
which
though
taste
profile
is
an
exact
duplicate
for
tumbler
heavy
on
the
caramel
and
light
on
the
roast
for
a
brown
ale
at
least
with
a
little
floral
hop
flourish
and
no
real
bitterness
to
speak
of
at
first
i
was
bothered
by
a
certain
perceived
thinness
of
body
with
tumbler
but
im
mostly
past
it
and
realize
that
its
appropriate
for
a
relatively
restrained
brew
carbonation
is
nice
and
low
spot
on
for
the
type
of
brew
sn
was
shooting
for
as
one
might
expect
for
such
a
traditional
and
well
executed
brown
ale
tumbler
is
very
drinkable
in
the
time
it
took
me
to
type
this
review
up
my
glass
is
almost
empty
a
great
new
offering
from
sierra
nevada
and
one
ill
definitely
come
back
to
this
fall
poured
out
a
medium
dark
amber
brew
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
has
moderate
carbonation
smells
like
it
has
a
nice
malty
backbone
taste
is
of
a
dry
beer
mildly
smoky
no
noticeable
hops
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
what
is
present
i
like
very
mild
session
beer
not
a
big
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
very
tolerable
cheers
d
great
way
to
transition
from
sweet
summer
ales
to
autumn
beers
this
would
be
great
on
tap
as
well
d
a
great
fallwinter
brown
ale
session
worthy
but
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
i
could
drink
this
again
d
a
very
enjoyable
easydrinking
brown
ale
from
sierra
nevada
wellrounded
and
refined
as
youd
expect
from
this
brewery
it
manages
to
be
both
sweeter
and
hoppier
than
many
american
brown
ale
its
down
to
80
here
today
in
dc
which
seems
positively
autumnal
after
july
and
august
and
this
is
a
welcome
fall
seasonal
for
2010
rjt
d
really
nice
brown
ale
lots
of
nice
nutty
and
smokey
flavors
but
still
balanced
to
be
easily
sessionable
d
right
in
the
middle
of
light
and
medium
in
body
so
naturally
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
imo
it
lacks
a
more
robust
chocolatecoffeehazelnut
flavor
that
ive
come
to
expect
in
most
browns
good
beer
overall
d
i
really
enjoyed
the
feel
of
this
beer
it
offers
a
smooth
almost
creamy
texture
while
still
being
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
which
makes
it
extremely
quaffable
to
me
i
could
sit
and
enjoy
45
pints
of
this
brew
very
good
with
a
decent
price
ill
definitely
buy
this
one
again
very
tasty
and
i
recommend
it
cheers
its
not
world
class

its
another
solid
beer

overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
brown
ale
the
aroma
threw
me
off
a
little
but
once
i
got
to
the
taste
i
enjoyed
it
more
and
those
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
started
to
show
up
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
pretty
crisp
slightly
prickly
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
especially
in
the
fall
time
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
was
pretty
nice
and
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
just
a
little
unbalanced
with
the
yeast
being
too
dominant
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
would
recommend
trying
it
if
you
like
brown
ales
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
wasnt
the
most
impressive
brown
ale
ive
had
but
it
was
still
nice
and
in
the
end
i
enjoyed
it
its
not
a
favorite
of
the
style
and
i
would
say
its
right
on
the
same
level
as
their
finest
kind
ipa
nice
job
guys
this
was
a
nice
brown
ale
keep
it
up
the
best
thing
about
it
was
the
smell
thought
the
taste
was
thin
and
average
wouldnt
buy
it
but
would
drink
it
for
free
overall
not
bad
for
the
style
but
lacks
body
complexity
and
flavor
i
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
see
myself
getting
again
this
is
my
second
time
trying
it
and
i
like
it
even
better
than
before
argh
why
do
i
keep
getting
this
got
the
variety
pack
and
this
one
again
ive
had
it
50
times
and
always
forget
how
unforgettable
it
is

i
like

probably
have
another
one
in
2
weeks
and
be
annoyed

this
is

its

beer
not

just
ok
i
did
expect
a

it
just

lacked

the
high
abv
doesnt
justify
a
stellar
review
however
love
the
name
a
really
enjoyable
and
finelycrafted
beer
i
mean
its
fine
its
not
something
for
which
youre
going

regret
paying

its

the
taste

seems

mineraley

wellbalanced
with
notes
of
caramel
not

sweet
though
great

makes
it
very
smooth

always
happy

see
it

the

render

silly
one

my
favorites
always
like
the
complex

not
much
to

one
of
my
favorite
beers
of

i
was
a
weekly
drinker
of
this
at
the
alamo
drafthouse
in

until
they
stopped
carrying
it
i
really
miss
it

to

this

it
is

than
it

i
wont

i
wouldnt

one

overall
a

the

altogether
a
terrific
beer
lots

have
with

they
go

great
the
beer
pours
a
nice
light
brown
with
a
soft
white
head
and
smells
of
toasted
bread
and
caramel
upon
tasting
the
beer
the
taste
is
mostly
in
line
with
the
smell
with
some
earthiness
and
chocolate
mixed
in
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth

creamy
with

overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
nice
flavors
and
drinkablility
but
the
star
of
this
beer
is
the
texture
which
is
outstanding
o
my
recollection
of
this
beer
from
previous
tastings
is
that
it
had
more
depth
of
flavor
and
less
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
american

the

mix
with

to
make
a

with

an
easy

everyday
kind
of
beer
overall
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
a
no
brainer
and
a
staple
type
beer
o
a
delicious
brown
ale
so
surprised
ive
not
rated
this
before
o
a
brown
ale
that
actually
has
some
depth
to
it
easy
drinking
while
also
being
interesting
to
the
last
sip
a
very
basic
yet
well
crafted
brown
ale
i
had
this
up
against
indian
brown
which
clearly
won
it
also
lost
against
avery
ellies
brown
but
by
a
hair
a
dogs
hair
even
o
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
with
a
very
enjoyable
flavor
o
a
really
good
brew
one
of
my
favorite
smuttynose
offerings
it
would
also
pair
nicely
with
a
variety
of
hearty
foods
i
will
revisit
this
ale
again
o
a
really
impressive
brown
ale
just
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
buy
with
regularity
the
pour
itself
was
a
reddish
brown
very
deep
the
taste
was
bready
with
hints
of
fruit
and
whisky
very
pleasant
and
smooth
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
ale
but
this
wasnt
the
brown
ale
could
save
the
night
it
just
boring
lackluster
its
browm
thats
about
it
nothing
outstanding
to
keep
you
coming
back
go
look
for
a
brown
ale
that
packs
a
punch
was
hoping
this
bee
was
good
but
sadly
its
diapponts
i
know
it
me
but
i
dont
like
it
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
enjoyable
on
cold
nights
with
nothing
out
of
balance
but
also
nothing
that
stands
out
as
exceptional
overall
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
are
just
tasty
and
it
is
really
kind
of
hard
to
define
why
i
like
the
grapefruit
hopping
in
a
brown
ale
as
it
just
works
well
would
love
to
try
a
fresher
version
so
i
will
have
to
pick
some
up
the
next
time
da
boss
and
i
are
back
east
overall
the
beer
was
sweeter
than
expected
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
im
a
fan
of
brown
ales
and
this
is
a
very
good
one
overall
definatly
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
had
but
still
not
a
huge
fan
of
browns
personally
definitely
one
of
the
superior
brown
ales
ive
had
this
is
much
more
complex
than
your
average
beer
of
this
style
the
hops
are
pretty
well
pronounced
the
beer
starts
off
pretty
mild
gradually
bringing
in
sweetness
from
the
darker
specialty
grains
then
the
herbal
smooth
bitterness
of
the
hops
rounds
everything
out
i
did
not
found
it
that
hoppy
maybe
a
notch
more
than
a
traditional
english
brown
ale
overall
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
with
great
sweetness
without
being
to
bitter
o
very
fine
brown
ale
good
for
sipping
or
as
a
dinner
accompaniment
despite
being
cited
for
having
american
hops
levels
probably
still
not
hopped
up
enough
for
many
but
certainly
a
tasty
and
satisfying
brew
for
traditionalists
who
dont
mind
a
little
extra
hop
bite
this
is
a
pretty
phenomenal
brown
ale
great
grainy
flavor
the
malts
are
toasted
to
nearperfection
sweet
notes
of
caramel
and
toffee
come
out
in
the
aftertaste
i
would
try
to
explain
what
the
hops
taste
like
but
i
had
a
rather
difficult
time
identifying
any
at
all
that
said
it
is
indeed
a
balanced
brew
and
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
had
o
other
than
the
lackluster
aroma
this
is
a
really
good
brown
ale
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
ive
had
better
but
this
is
still
pretty
good
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
to

thin
tan
head
that
quickly

some
lacing
remained
but
not
much
the
taste
and
the
smell
were
very
similar
both
were
of
toasted
malts
nuts
and
caramel
sweetness
modest
carbonation
and
a
medium

a

brown
ale
from
another
local
brewery
overall
a
beer
thats
clearly
had
better
days
but
it
degrades
pretty
well
id
say
definitely
one
that
can
be
enjoyed
well
after
the
hops
have
faded
would
love
to
try
this
one
fresh
someday
o
overall
im
quite
pleased
with
this
beer
and
would
definitely
buy
again
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
o
another
great
one
from
smutty
love
it
would
love
a
case
of
this
drinkabilty
this
is
one
that
ill
definitely
come
back
to
again
and
again
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
love
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
beer
and
cooking
with
it
again
try
this
beer
it
is
totally
worth
it
its
price
is
excellent
and
you
really
cant
beat
it
o
very
solid
brown
ale
i
liked
the
complexity
of
flavors
to
this
one
and
will
definitely
get
it
again
this
one
is
a
nice
solid
brown
ale
nothing
earth
shattering
it
had
very
little
smell
and
the
head
was
white
lacy
and
short
lived
the
mouth
feel
was
the
strong
point
and
was
has
more
body
than
newcastle
there
is
a
snappy
cut
off
due
to
the
higher
alcohol
content
i
would
buy
this
again
similar
in
both
namesake
and
flavor
to
averys
brown
ale
out
of
boulder
this
is
a
delicious
brew
from
smuttynose
it
pours
light
for
a
brown
almost
more
of
an
amber
color
with
less
than
an
inch
of
tan
lace
head
strong
aromas
of
drip
coffee
above
sweeter
amber
malts
make
this
an
enticing
pour
before
any
flavors
come
in
i
notice
body
lots
of
heft
for
a
beer
on
the
lighter
side
color
wise
sweet
malts
spent
coffee
grounds
and
a
pronounced
nutty
finish
this
is
as
complex
yet
mellow
and
drinkable
as
they
come
a
beer
lovers
brown
ale
id
say
carbonation
is
just
enough
alcohol
content
is
warming
but
not
tasted
and
there
is
a
certain
smoothness
not
only
to
the
beer
itself
but
to
the
buzz
it
generates
after
a
few
pints
i
strongly
recommend
this
to
the
lover
of
fine
browns
real
good
this
is
a
good
tasting
brown
ale
but
i
cant
rank
it
up
there
as
a
world
class
beer
like
the
brothers
did
o
a
very
balanced
and
flavorful
beer
not
as
dark
or
thick
as
some
brown
ales
out
there
but
still
solid
and
a
fine
beer
to
drink
any
time
or
year
this
is
my
first
review
but
this
ale
drove
me
to
this
site
to
leave
comments
on
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
recent
memory
i
like
that
deweys
they
have
rotating
taps
and
you
are
able
to
check
them
out
on
line
before
venturing
out
so
there
is
a
pretty
decent
chance
of
getting
what
is
actually
stated
on
their
web
site
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
portsmouth
brewery
in
portsmouth
nh
it
has
a
pleasant
odor
and
great
rich
brown
color
but
it
has
a
smooth
nutty
hoppy
taste
that
really
sets
this
apart
from
the
other
beers
that
were
also
on
tap
even
though
there
were
twelve
other
beers
to
choose
from
i
got
another
old
brown
dog
o
this
beer
is
the
line
the
line
between
good
and
great
brown
ales
everything
is
in
order
from
the
earthy
nutty
palate
to
the
soft
pleasing
mouthfeel
that
makes
this
beer
best
closer
to
room
temperature
but
theres
no
chances
taken
here
and
thats
ok
it
seems
that
this
dog
is
meant
to
be
a
traditional
brew
and
in
that
sense
it
succeeds
id
just
be
surprised
if
i
ever
got
the
urge
to
pick
it
up
again
absolutely
a
winner
here
overall
as
a
brown
ale
one
of
the
better
options
available
goes
down
smooth
and
is
not
to
heavy
or
syrupy
still
can
taste
some
of
the
hops
behind
all
of
the
malts
has
a
really
pleasant
ending
and
after
taste
that
is
appealing
usually
i
have
to
take
a
sip
of
water
after
brown
ales
and
porters
because
of
the
overwhelming
taste
of
sweet
syrup
this
is
a
well
balanced
brown
ale
o
one
of
the
first
smuttys
ive
had
and
an
instant
favorite
from
the
new
hampshire
outfit
they
made
this
big
enough
to
pack
the
flavors
we
love
from
a
true
american
brown
without
going
crazy
with
some
exotic
style
this
is
down
to
earth
and
enjoyable
just
a
great
year
round
offering
that
you
know
what
youre
getting
simple
and
classy
pours
copper
brown
with
light
haze
and
a
stubborn
full
head
of
foam
lace
coats
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
toasted
malt
toffee
nutty
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
has
some
herbal
hops
in
back
lightly
fruity
that
give
a
touch
of
earth
taste
is
rich
malt
and
lightly
sweet
velvety
smooth
and
buttery
biscuit
with
subtle
herbal
dark
fruits
hops
show
up
mid
palate
with
some
bitter
fade
quickly
and
the
malt
opens
up
with
some
roast
and
coffee
theres
a
malt
dryness
and
a
slight
alcohol
dryness
thats
stately
yet
devil
may
care
aftertaste
is
lightly
sweet
and
bready
this
is
a
very
original
brown
ale
with
a
rousing
and
robust
malt
character
fantastic
overall
a
tasty
and
slight
complex
brown
ale
good
first
try
from
smuttynose
will
definitely
be
going
back
for
more
overall
a
tasty
wellmade
brew
with
no
detectable
defects
if
it
were
me
brewing
it
i
would
to
kick
in
some
more
chocolate
malt
to
up
the
flavor
and
darken
the
color
definitely
for
those
who
favor
malt
over
hops
i
favor
both
depending
on
the
occasion
one
could
drink
too
many
of
these
as
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
beer
with
6
7
abv
this
was
a
draft
which
had
a
feeble
head
although
i
was
at
a
restaurant
at
laguardia
airport
so
who
knows
how
clean
the
glass
was
the
color
was
a
nice
dark
copper
carmel
nose
with
a
nice
nutty
flavor
the
lingering
after
taste
was
very
strong
alcohol
o
its
pretty
solid
i
kind
of
feel
like
saying
its
not
you
its
me
due
to
the
fact
that
its
well
made
and
well
balanced
but
not
my
thing
brown
ale
fans
will
really
like
it
overall
recommended
i
would
rate
it
a
4
5
on
the
unique
qualities
for
a
brown
ale
tasty
brew
o
overall
a
nice
steady
drinkable
brown
ale
think
a
malty
earthy
nutty
type
of
experience
and
that
is
what
this
beer
is
all
about
pretty
good
overall
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
beats
averys
ellies
why
always
the
wet
dog
this
is
one
nice
chocolate
brown
wet
new
hampshire
dog
on
the
beach
let
it
warm
i
love
the
taste
but
it
leaves
me
begging
as
the
sweet
maltiness
teases
but
never
quite
satisfies
hint
of
caramel
hint
of
burnt
malt
theres
a
lot
of
amber
or
irish
red
qualities
very
nice
for
the
price
id
love
to
see
a
double
malted
version
to
truly
satisfy
a
teasingly
good
ale
overall
a
very
average
ale
pours
brown
with
cocoa
hues
and
a
solid
sheet
of
fine
tan
foam
smells
nice
and
bready
with
some
herbal
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
graham
with
just
a
touch
of
tea
flavor
is
malt
nuts
toasted
bread
burnt
coffee
really
light
some
solid
bits
of
leather
medium
on
full
bodied
with
light
carb
and
a
wet
finish
decent
for
the
style
not
available
in
my
area
so
id
rather
drink
averys
ellies
instead
just
another
brown
ale
but
its
quite
drinkable
as
long
as
you
down

this
is
not
just
an
american
brown
ale
its
more
like
an
american
scottish
ale
its
all
about
malt
it
probably
wont
appeal
to
a
lot
of
drinkers
but
its
one
of
the
better
american
brown
ales
ive
had
my
hats
off
to
a
brewer
who
is
not
afraid
to
leave
the
hops
alone
and
let
the

remember
when
the
simpsons
was
good
remember
the
episode
where
moe
sells
homer
red
tick
beer
theres
a
gag
where
the
brewer
tastes
the
beer
and
proclaims
needs
more
dog
im
referring
to
this
episode
which
apparently
aired
in
1997
ouch
because
i
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
beer
other
than
i
find
the
name
amusing
its
a
solid
brown
ale
its
not
surly
bender
but
what
is
excellent
example
of
the
style
that
light
chocolate
character
is
a
welcome
treat
though
not
as
hoppy
as
some
which
i
actually
prefer
in
this
type
of
brew
overall
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
beer
really
drinkable
with
a
nice
flavor
i
could
definitely
drink
more
than
one
the
only
con
for
me
was
it
was
slightly
more
carbonated
than
i
generally
prefer
in
a
beer
but
that
certainly
wouldnt
stop
me
from
having
another
the
malts
really
come
through
with
this
brown
ale
rich
fairly
sweet
and
inviting
with
just
the
right
touch
of
hop
bitterness
to
balance
things
out
one
gets
a
small
sense
of
the
alcohol
presence
but
it
stays
pretty
well
hidden
in
the
background
so
yeah
if
youre
looking
for
a
topnotch
maltcentric
brown
ale
find
one
of
these
brews
and
enjoy
o
i
enjoyed
the
hops
on
this
one
as
it
added
another
demension
but
the
malt
profile
seemed
simple
that
could
be
what
they
were
going
for
but
it
didnt
quite
click
for
me
still
worth
trying
though
this
is
very
simple
and
that
is
not
always
a
bad
thing
it
just
does
not
do
it
for
me
i
think
the
lingering
metallic
character
and
thin
mouth
are
the
biggest
detractors
though
still
enjoyable
the
beer
pours
a
dark
and
candied
brown
with
the
slightest
hint
of
ambering
notes
like
maple
syrup
a
lovely
light
tan
head
of
tightly
packed
and
smooth
bubbles
forms
over
the
top
of
the
beer
and
stands
at
about
a
fingerswidth
lacing
from
the
head
is
like
thin
and
slightly
slippery
curtains
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
leaving
cob
webs
of
foam
in
its
wake
the
beers
body
is
dark
but
relatively
clean
with
a
very
light
haze
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
a
nutty
roast
similar
to
lighter
porters
that
i
have
smelt
hazelnut
coffee
comes
to
mind
though
there
is
a
very
faint
bitter
kiss
to
the
nose
suggesting
hops
and
some
semisweet
chocolate
notes
the
beer
tastes
lightly
roasty
and
nutty
with
some
lovely
light
complexities
playing
on
the
tongue
the
beer
begins
with
light
sweet
caramel
malts
before
opening
into
very
light
roasted
flavors
which
eventually
introduce
nutty
and
chocolate
flavors
that
smooth
through
the
finish
alongside
the
returning
caramel
malts
the
aftertaste
is
of
sweet
malt
coffee
almost
like
bittersweet
chocolate
as
i
sip
it
more
i
notice
a
certain
bitter
quality
building
in
my
mouth
though
it
has
no
discernible
flavoring
to
it
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
of
body
with
a
nice
chewiness
to
it
the
mouth
is
left
a
little
roasted
dry
on
the
tongue
but
with
a
good
sheen
of
saliva
sitting
over
the
tongue
to
dampen
it
down
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
brown
ale
im
actually
really
digging
this
beer
right
now
it
doesnt
blow
you
away
in
any
category
but
has
an
allaround
balanced
flavoring
that
is
excellent
to
sip
on
this
beer
is
a
great
fall
beer
i
imagine
and
is
surely
excellent
for
sipping
on
as
you
watch
the
world
blow
by
this
beer
is
the
next
step
up
from
sessionable
a
good
beer
from
smuttynose
for
sure
overall
fantastic
beer
great
session
beer
balanced
malt
and
hops
clean
nose
overall
at
one
time
this
would
have
been
the
bees
knees
but
like
that
saying
those
times
have
passed
a
nice
brown
ale
but
more
like
your
fathers
brown
if
your
father
was
a
craft
beer
drinker
o
tasty
stuff
this
gets
much
better
as
it
warms
too
paired
with
a
hearty
pork
chop
meal
and
i
was
diggin
it
ive
had
this
beer
both
on
draft
and
from
the
bottle
while
draft
is
obviously
the
superior
drinking
method
the
bottle
is
every
bit
as
tasty
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
youre
missing
out
this
beer
pours
up
a
deep
copperlight
mahogany
with
about
a
two
finger
head
some
retention
and
some
lacing
although
minimal
in
both
cases
the
nose
is
quite
nice
i
cant
quite
pick
out
all
the
aromas
but
it
is
pleasant
and
appealing
taste
is
very
well
balanced
lucious
and
sweet
upfront
seamlessly
giving
way
to
a
mild
hoppiness
on
the
finish
it
is
a
mild
flavor
yet
a
full
flavor
as
well
nothing
is
quite
in
your
face
but
it
is
loaded
with
understated
flavor
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
a
small
aftertaste
that
is
similar
to
dark
chocolate
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
of
these
maybe
next
trip
a
lot
lighter
in
flavor
than
i
remember
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
if
your
looking
for
ambers
with
some
serious
taste
and
quality
then
this
is
your
beer
if
you
get
the
chance
try
it
its
worth
it
smuttynose
i
friggin
hate
you
you
make
in
impossible
to
pick
your
best
beer
this
beer
has
an
incredible
pour
the
color
has
a
great
copper
glow
in
the
low
level
bar
light
the
fragrance
is
good
and
the
flavor
is
a
incredible
while
most
beers
that
are
amazing
on
the
first
beer
and
you
cant
see
drinking
more
this
is
not
the
case
with
old
brown
dog
it
is
a
staple
of
the
darker
beer
diet
overall
the
nice
flavors
drinkability
and
good
smooth
transitions
of
the
brew
make
for
a
great
one
to
go
out
and
try
and
try
again
o
enjoyable
beer
probably
would
not
have
more
than
two
in
one
setting
but
would
defintely
order
it
again
i
like
this
brown
ale
the
appearance
is
a
ruddy
brown
which
pours
a
quarter
inch
head
the
nose
is
of
sweet
malty
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
dark
fruit
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
overall
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
overall
drinkability
would
make
a
good
session
o
much
better
as
it
warms
this
is
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
a
fresher
bottle
would
be
even
better
pretty
decent
when
on
draft
o
very
mild
and
restrained
but
in
a
good
way
the
true
strength
of
this
brew
is
very
well
hidden
and
leaves
the
flavor
in
its
invisible
wake
a
very
good
brown
o
for
a
beer
which
label
doesnt
present
it
as
much
this
beer
is
really
good
lots
of
malt
and
roast
flavors
that
are
complimented
by
sweet
tooth
ingredients
would
seek
this
out
again
o
i
really
liked
this
brown
ale
i
think
my
favorite
one
to
date
pours
a
dark
muddy
copper
with
a
finger
of
beige
head
the
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
sticks
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
leaving
a
healthy
dose
of
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
bready
for
sure
definite
malt
forward
flavor
with
a
bitter
and
semidry
finish
not
fancy
but
still
one
of
the
best
browns
around
o
this
might
be
an
interesting
beer

i
dont
get
it
again
smutty
does
this
one
well
they
dont
overdo
it
which
i
think
is
crucial
while
many
breweries
try
to
one
up
one
another
and
become
more
extreme
beers
like
this
become
more
and
more
appreciated
the
appearance
and
the
nose
werent
all
that
i
was
expecting
but
the
flavor
is
solid
the
flavor
is
full
enjoyable
and
to
style
its
worth
trying
nothing
bad
going
on
here
but
i
dont
think
ill
ever
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
poured
from
a
12

bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
small
brownish
colored
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
smells
of
darkly
roasted
malt
and
slight
coffee
notes
very
nice
tastes
of
slight
coffee
notes
but
primarily
of
darkly
roasted
grain
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
goes
down
real
smooth
for
a
medium
bodied
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
ogood
drinking
brown
ale
with
nice
malt
character
and
flavor
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
were
the
quality
malts
and
the
drying
finish
to
the
feel
these
malts
showed
depth
and
solid
flavoring
but
they
become
a
bit
mild
and
redundant
by
the
end
of
the
glass
we
wished
the
nose
was
more
robust
showcasing
more
of
those
great
malts
everything
else
about
this
beer
is
pretty
average
but
it
makes
for
a
tasty
wellbalanced
treat
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
new
standard
to
hold
other
brown
ales
to
for
me
o
if
youre
into
brown
ale
malty
goodness
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
a
good
beer
regardless
but
especially
good
if
you
like
brown
ales
smells
and
tastes
good
and
has
a
solid
mouthfeel
as
with
the
other
smuttynose
beers
that
ive
had
theres
nothing
spectacular
or
particularly
different
about
this
beer
but
its
just
an
allaround
good
beer
id
look
for
this
one
again
overall
i
enjoy
this
more
now
than
i
remember
first
sampling
in
the
bottle
maybe
that
bottle
wasnt
fresh
or
handled
poorly
nothing
stellar
or
monumental
but
just
a
really
drinkable
solid
brown
ale
not
my
favorite
but
good
nontheless
and
quite
acceptable
to
find
on
draft
at
a
random
bar
in
nyc
overall
this
is
good
for
the
style
and
good
for
me
o
overall
another
winner
from
smutty
really
easy
drinker
and
one
of
the
better
browns
ive
had
very
accessible
id
have
this
again
and
again
and
again
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
deep
auburnbrown
color
that
is
crisp
and
clean
looking
a
low
profile
filmy
white
head
sits
atop
the
brew
the
beer
has
a
light
nose
of
nut
and
caramel
the
flavor
profile
is
a
blending
of
roasted
and
rich
sweetness
with
a
toffeenut
backbone
and
a
very
light
hopping
at
the
end
smooth
clean
finish
with
a
lightly
sweet
and
roasted
aftertaste
this
is
a
tasty
staple
beer
that
you
cant
go
wrong
having
on
hand
in
your
fridge
o
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brown
i
feel
the
style
is
the
only
thing
limiting
this
beer
from
near
perfection
cheers
to
my
favorite
smuttynose
brew
this
was
an
interesting
brown
ale
the
complexity
wasnt
quite
there
but
overall
the
palate
seemed
pleasing
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
offered
up
o
i
like
this
brown
ale
it
is
a
definite
easy
drinker
as
i
could
easily
put
away
a
few
of
these
o
flavorful
brown
ale
has
some
hints
of
that
coffeechocolate
flavor
thats
seen
in
stouts
but
is
somelight
lighter
with
a
distinctive
bitterness
again
very
tasty
can
definitely
down
a
few
of
these
o
another
very
good
beer
from
smuttynose
it
isnt
as
flavorful
as
some
brown
ales
but
the
taste
is
balanced
and
complex
it
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
probably
have
several
without
getting
sick
of
it
i
will
probably
get
this
beer
again
o
an
enjoyable
brown
ale
quite
different
than
a
stout
or
porter
of
the
same
strength
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
combination
of
fruit
and
bitterness
good
stuff
creamy
and
drinkable
and
if
you
like
this
kind
of
beer
than
you
would
probally
think
it
was
great
feels
mildly
carbonated
powdery
and
dry
to
the
palate

well

tasty
overall
a
solid

ale
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
brown

i
find
this
one
is
ok

a
deep

a
huge
off

never

don
henley
said
dont
look
back
you
can
never
look
back
i
remember
really
enjoying
this
beer
but
today
i
fell
like
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
decent
beer
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
anymore
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
flavors
are
thin
on
the
palate
minimal
malt
mildly
bitter
roast
finish
finish
is
nice
id
have
again
nice
standby
beer
but
rather
unremarkable
definitely
hoppier
and
fruitier
than
your
average
brown
ale
but
its
well
integrated
here
the
availability
and
price
in
this
area
definitely
make
it
one
of
the
gotos
for
the
style
notes
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
i
dont
think
its
style
suits
it
very
good
with
great
flavor
and
good
mouthfeel
but
just
a
bit
off
for
the
style
i
would
try
it
again
but
there
are
other
smuttynose
offerings
i
would
go
for
beforehand
o
a
good
beer
a
bit
stronger
than
your
average
english
brown
ale
yet
not
as
hoppy
as
some
american
offerings
smell
is
sweet
and
a
bit
caramellic
sweet
taste
with
not
much
depth
drinkable
but
not
more
than
that
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
a
little
bit
heavier
than
i
would
prefer
on
the
feel
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
i
usually
only
end
up
with
this
one
from
the
variety
pack
but
i
always
enjoy
it
12
ounce
bottle
the
stamp
on
the
bottle
is
smudged
but
it
says
its
best
before
some
time
in
february
2012
bought
it
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
pack
at
a
local
kroger
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
enough
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
the
brew
smells
like
bready
and
caramel
malt
nuts
bittersweet
chocolate
and
toffee
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
flavors
noticeable
cherries
raisins
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
coating
with
good
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brown
ale
id
buy
this
again
in
the
future
i
liked
it
i
feel
like
if
some
of
this
were
tuned
or
even
pulled
out
some
of
those
flavors
this
could
be
a
very
good
brown
until
then
it
is
average
at
best
o
a
good
brown
ale
but
far
from
the
best
ive
had
and
just
not
fitting
of
the
world
class
rating
that
the
bros
gave
it
id
certainly
buy
it
again
if
i
was
looking
for
a
brown
ale
and
it
was
all
that
was
available
but
i
dont
think
it
would
ever
be
my
first
choice
d
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
tried
so
far
the
robust
chocolate
caramel
flavors
really
makes
this
beer
shine
cool
d
this
is
a
really
good
moderately
roasty
brown
that
i
would
love
to
have
a
few
more
of
o
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
one
is
about
average
in
every
way
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
well
crafted
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
ale
ill
buy
this
again
its
tasty
its
refreshing
its
a
nutty
toasted
ripe
fruit
brown
ale
o
nice
brown
ale
with
a
an
equally
good
taste
and
mouthfeel
wouldnt
hesitate
to
purchase
a
six
went
well
on
a
chilly
november
night
but
i
could
see
this
working
year
round
found
this
poor
little
doggy
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
a
few
days
after
his
bestby
month
hope
hes
still
a
good
boy
pours
a
redbrown
color
with
a
modest
head
that
quickly
shrinks
to
a
cap
aroma
is
roasty
maltiness
with
some
cocoa
powder
underneath
standard
but
solid
the
taste
is
a
nice
toasted
malt
with
earthy
aspects
theres
a
bit
of
hop
on
the
finish
a
dry
brown
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
wellcarbonated
and
mediumbodied
and
the
drinkability
is
about
what
youd
expect
for
the
abv
overall
a
good
brown
ale
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
attractive
rich
brown
pour
with
1
finger
of
off
white
head
minimal
lacing
that
vanishes
quickly
smell
is
of
carmel
and
nuts
perhaps
a
note
of
maltsbread
grain
mild
on
the
nose
taste
is
quite
smooth
with
only
a
minimal
hops
bite
on
the
end
some
bitterness
but
more
on
the
malty
end
of
the
spectrum
taste
follows
the
nose
with
carmel
and
a
nuttyearthy
tone
feel
is
a
good
mix
of
carbonation
and
silk
a
little
dry
but
not
watery
overall
a
pretty
solid
brown
but
nothing
outstanding
could
use
a
boost
on
the
flavor
with
more
richcomplex
notes
pretty
straight
forward
brown
will
drink
another
without
a
doubt
pretty
tasty
if
youre
like
me
and
you
almost
instinctually
seek
out
the
pale
ales
and
ipas
this
would
be
a
nice
breath
of
fresh
air
a
reminder
of
what
a
simple
good
malty
brown
ale
tastes
like
if
nothing
else
itll
help
you
appreciate
your
alpha
acids
and
ibus
when
you
return
to
the
bitter
side
this
beer
is
completely
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
know
ill
buy
it
again
o
a
nice
roasty
brown
ale
not
dark
enough
to
be
a
porter
but
more
hop
presence
than
an
english
brown
if
you
like
brown
ales
this
is
a
very
good
representation
very
tasty
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
didnt
stick
around
smells
malty
with
some
englishy
hops
tastes
of
semi
sweet
malt
and
ends
a
bit
dryer
than
i
prefer
pretty
solid
but
not
my
1
as
it
used
to
be
id
recommend
it
pretty
highly
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
overall
this
was
a
solid
if
not
a
little
light
brown
ale
its
not
meant
to
be
overpowering
and
comes
across
as
a
very
drinkable
but
darker
and
sweeter
session
ale
m
not
too
much
carbonation
which
makes
the
initial
mouthfeel
quite
nice
and
smooth
tingles
only
slightly
which
is
what
i
look
for
in
a
brown
ale
once
the
old
brown
dog
ale
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
can
become
a
bit
sharp
and
bitter
overall
a
great
looking
and
smelling
brew
but
it
falls
short
of
fulfilling
ones
initial
expectations
given
the
high
reviews
it
is
entirely
plausible
this
was
a
randomly
bad
bottle
and
an
isolated
occurrence
i
would
be
happy
to
give
this
one
another
try
slight
bitter
hp
bite
and
brown
bread
flavor
not
sweet
not
sour
well
balanced
this
is
a
beer
you
could
drink
by
the
half
gallon
this
is
the
best
brown
ale
that
i
have
tried
so
far
just
an
easy
drinking
ale
that
is
just
perfect
for
the
fall
a
brown
color
when
poured
and
a
hint
of
both
caramel
and
chocolate
going
to
be
a
staple
for
me
from
here
on
out
look
forward
to
trying
it
on
draft
i
tried
this
beer
at
a
local
familypub
pizza
restaurant
it
was
from
tap
however
i
think
the
carbonation
level
was
a
little
low
the
beer
had
a
nice
caramel
color
to
it
the
overall
texture
and
taste
was
decent
but
lacked
depth
generally
good
tasting
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
o
a
good
brown
ale
from
smuttynose
very
easy
to
drink
it
was
just
a
bit
to
sweet
for
my
taste
needed
a
bit
more
body
to
it
to
hold
it
all
up
glad
i
tried
it
looking
forward
to
really
old
dog
with
a
year
on
it
o
very
enjoyable
easy
drinker
nothing
fancy
just
good
beer
oa
solid
high
b
beer
id
almost
say
this
in
combination
with
gis
ipa
is
what
im
looking
for
when
i
want
an
everyday
beer
that
is
a
b
overall
an
aboveaverage
american
brown
from
a
continually
impressing
brewery
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
o
overall
a
well
above
brown
ale
super
easy
to
drink
and
felt
like
i
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
would
definitely
have
again
if
i
was
looking
for
a
brown
ale
pretty
good
brown
overall
was
hoping
for
more
flavor
but
its
still
really
nice
imo
not
as
good
as
the
samuel
smith
nut
brown
but
fairly
close
give
this
one
a
try
this
is
the
way
a
brown
ale
should
be
outstanding
flaovr
moreys
bottom
line
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
a
nice
changeofpace
fall
beer
ive
been
sipping
on
oktoberfest
and
pumpkin
ales
d
i
had
more
than
one
and
would
have
it
again
o
havent
had
brown
ale
in
awhile
i
might
need
to
go
on
a
brown
ale
binge
lol
great
balance
of
flavors
nothing
else
to
say
probably
my
favorite
english
style
brown
ale
this
is
a
very
fluid
liquidy
brew
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
disguised
so
dont
just
sit
there
enjoying
one
after
the
other
and
thinking
to
yourself
man
these
are
tasty
suckers
i
can
drink
these
all
day
long
overall
this
is
a
quality
brown
ale
lots
of
flavor
in
this
i
would
recommend
if
you
are
into
the
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
really
my
favorite
brown
ale
it
seems
well
puttogether
but
the
flavor
profile
just
doesnt
float
my
boat
overall
balanced
with
great
flavor
but
a
bit
of
a
rough
edge
this
could
make
a
worldclass
lager
same
flavor
but
smoother
o
great
brown
ale
one
of
my
new
favorites
o
very
good
example
of
what
a
brown
should
be
no
surprises
just
a
very
well
put
together
beer
this
would
be
a
great
everyday
brown
ale
especially
with
barbecue
while
not
as
complex
and
robust
as
i
had
expected
smuttynose
is
as
reliable
and
loveable
as
the
dog
who
obediently
sits
on
the
brews
label
good
stuff
pair
it
with
smokier
bbq
fare
as
this
brew
tends
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
make
mine
a
smutty
o
tasty
brown
ale
with
more
hop
flavor
than
most
brown
ales
enjoyable
would
drink
again
overall
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
its
heavy
on
the
malts
but
they
bring
a
variety
of
flavors
that
i
really
like
quite
good
im
looking
forward
to
trying
a
fresher
bottle
o
solid
brown
ale
with
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
than
most
of
the
other
brown
ales
ive
tried
not
one
of
my
favorites
o
old
brown
dog
is
certainly
a
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
with
its
characteristically
a
big
beer
in
a
small
bottle
offering
ample
complexities
yet
defined
with
a
fine
sense
of
control
a
great
filler
for
any
fridge
o
overall
a
fine
brown
ale
but
not
something
i
will
drink
regularly
overall
a
pretty
solid
brown
ale
here
and
enjoyable
very
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
only
becoming
evident
as
the
mouth
dries
between
sipsgulps
o
a
nice
brown
ale
from
smutty
final
thoughts
its
a
very
good
beer
and
pretty
good
textbook
style
o
a
good
brown
ale
go
fetch
one
and
take
it
for
a
walk
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
nice
caramel
and
toasted
malt
flavors
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
that
ive
tasted
old
brown
dog
mans
best
friend
my
1st
try
from
smuttynose
and
i
havent
been
back
to
anything
by
the
company
from
notes
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
very
little
smell
wise
save
for
a
mild
soury
malt
smell
no
abv
printed
on
bottle
that
poured
a
rich
caramel
color
wno
head
but
lil
bubbles
hoppy
malty
and
a
lil
typical
but
not
smooth
goin
down
kinda
had
to
choke
her
down
before
i
split
the
rest
wthe
sink
drain
ill
have
to
try
a
different
style
from
this
brewery
but
this
was
a
turn
off
that
will
keep
other
breweries
ahead
of
the
smut
on
my
to
tryget
list
brown
ales
have
never
been
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
one
really
nails
it
ive
never
had
a
tastier
brown
ale
besides
dogfish
heads
iba
but
thats
not
really
a
brown
ale
because
of
it
being
a
hybrid
beer
so
on
its
own
this
is
my
favorite
brown
ale
to
date
the
kiss
of
hops
on
the
beginning
and
after
taste
balances
this
beer
out
so
well
the
doesnt
takes
away
from
the
malts
at
all
and
the
dry
finish
really
compliments
the
cocoa
like
chocolate
malts
the
earthy
herbal
aftertaste
also
really
gives
this
beer
an
excellent
score
in
the
taste
department
i
got
this
in
the
smuttynose
variety
sampler
12
pack
and
its
definitely
worth
buying
overall
a
solid
straightforward
brown
ale
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
but
nothing
to
geek
out
about
a
soothing
beer
if
that
makes
sense
and
screams
for
fall
weather
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
during
football
season
assuming
they
will
figure
their
shit
out
feels
very
sessionable
though
the
abvs
will
eventually
catch
up
to
you
a
pretty
nice
beer
but
seems
a
bit
light
on
flavor
for
a
brown
ale
certainly
enjoyable
and
for
the
abv
drinkable
as
all
hell
o
solid
beer
from
smuttynose
not
too
complex
but
very
strightforward
and
enjoyable
overall
a
brown
ale
with
character
mellow
and
consistent
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
good
sessionable
brown
and
it
paired
well
with
my
steak
o
nice
easy
drinking
brown
that
tastes
a
bit
like
a
stout
but
looks
like
a
brown
outstanding
beer
overall
o
pretty
good
not
awesome
not
bad
drinkable
for
sure
decent
pours
a
clear
amber

12

and
decent
lacing
smells
of
slight
nut
hops
sweet
malt
slight
earthy
malt
hint
of
roasted

and
hint
of
floral

fits
the
style
of
an
american
brown
ale
mouth
feel
is

clean
with

of

overall
not

but
it
got
to
me
after
a
while
and
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
cheers
overallvery
impressed
my
first
smuttynose
in
a
while
only
thing
i
wish
was
a
little
lower
abv
to
make
more
sessionable
flavor
was
great
awesome
brown
ale
edit
best
before
date
is
september
2011
so
i
guess
its
fresh
overall
a
style
i
havent
had
many
of
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
thus
far
high
on
flavor
while
balanced
enough
to
enjoy
during
the
summer
months
just
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
out
there
o
a
delightful
and
versatile
beer
paired
well
with
a
sharp
but
sweet
wisconsin
cows
milk
cheddar
summer
breeze
i
would
like
to
have
this
around
all
yearround
amber
brown
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
sticky
webs
of
lace
and
great
retention
the
smell
is
malty
with
chocolate
hints
of
coffee
and
tons
of
caramel
sweet
caramel
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
taste
great
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
touches
of
roasted
notes
some
nutty
qualities
balance
this
brown
ale
to
a
well
rounded
and
easy
to
drink
beverage
lightmedium
body
is
smooth
and
tasty
nice
beer
not
one
of
my
faves
but
very
good
overall
a
great
brown
ale
very
highly
drinkable
and
a
great
mixture
of
flavors
smell
was
a
bit
weak
but
standard
for
a
brown
ale
good
beer
cheers
overall
seriously
great
rich
and
sweet
but
far
from
cloying
this
beer
was
one
of
my
introductions
to
craft
beer
years
ago
i
revisited
it
recently
and
could
not
stop
thinking
about
it
so
damn
good
fairly
full
in
body
the
effervescence
is
crisp
upfront
but
drops
quickly
a
touch
of
warming
late
this
brew
is
really
quite
good
hoppy
enough
for
hopheads
without
being
overkill
for
the
malties
like
me
may
i
have
another
please
drinkability
overall
not
bad
but
not
a
favorite
pours
a
hazy
brown
to
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
caramel
and
a
coffee
roast
in
the
taste
faint
caramel
and
a
nice
dry
coffee
presence
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
sticky
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
nice
mix
of
caramle
and
coffee
a
nice
body
and
easy
to
drink
d
very
drinkable
the
malt
flavor
is
very
rich
and
sweet
but
never
gets
too
sweet
the
other
flavors
do
a
great
job
of
balancing
out
the
flavors
butterscotch
with
a
hint
of
piney
hops
to
balance
out
finishes
with
caramel
and
malt
a
solid
beer
and
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
out
there
this
is
the
beer
that
first
drew
me
into
craft
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
i
would
prefer
there
to
be
a
little
more
nuttiness
in
the
flavor
to
balance
out
the
malts
and
the
bitter
presence
of
the
hops
some
additional
carbonation
would
benefit
this
beer
as
well
overall
a
medium
to
light
bodied
beer
which
is
decent
and
drinkable
o
a
mellow
drinkable
brown
ale
with
a
focus
on
sweet
malt
flavor
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
no
head
at
all
zilch
just
a
thin
ring
around
the
edge
this
looks
like
a
tappour
i
give
it
a
swirl
to
get
some
of
the
aromas
started
sweet
syrup
pie
crust
chocolate
malt
in
the
nose
good
firm
body
decent
carbonation
backing
it
up
smooth
on
the
edges
sweet
malts
wow
this
is
all
malt
and
i
like
it
bitterness
is
absent
caramel
corn
graham
cracker
bread
and
just
the
slightest
of
alcohol
noted
i
dig
it
brown
ales
arent
usually
my
goto
beer
but
this
is
a
good
one
that
i
will
surely
have
again
cheers
o
really
like
this
one
a
perfect
job
of
crafting
what
a
brown
should
be
this
moves
into
my
top
2
list
for
american
browns
will
buy
this
often
d
the
brown
ale
to
which
all
others
should
be
judged
i
can
have
this
any
time
anywhere
delicious
d
this
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
for
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
brown
ales
smuttynose
hit
this
style
on
the
head
i
can
and
will
drink
many
more
of
these
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
and
i
feel
lucky
to
have
it
as
a
fantastically
priced
local
big
bold
toasted
malt
toffee
flavor
balanced
with
a
small
amount
of
hops
with
a
full
luscious
creamy
mouthfeel
you
dont
always
need
to
be
extreme
to
make
a
great
tasting
beer
so
i
am
in
new
hampshire
for
the
great
bay
half
marathon
its
the
night
before
a
race
and
why
not
drink
some
ok
alot
of
the
local
beer
the
old
brown
dog
from
smuttynose
is
good
this
beer
has
was
a
heavy
copperlight
brown
in
color
with
thin
white
head
and
great
lace
the
smell
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
beer
had
some
sweetness
and
roast
flavors
that
were
goos
in
taste
the
smell
funnels
into
the
taste
of
this
beer
the
light
abv
leads
to
this
beer
being
a
session
certainly
worth
a
taste
feels
great
and
over
all
this
is
probably
my
favorite
am
brown
no
joke
overall
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
not
something
that
ill
be
going
back
to
anytime
soon
but
its
a
decent
offering
from
smuttynose
thats
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
wow
very
nice
brown
ale
here
like
an
authentic
newcastle
nothing
that
will
blow
your
socks
off
like
dfh
palo
santo
or
vastly
different
like
dfh
indian
brown
but
a
benchmark
for
the
style
nonetheless
o
interesting
take
on
a
brown
ale
relatively
high
abv
makes
this
more
of
a
sipping
beer
chocolatespicedried
fruit
profile
makes
me
think
this
could
be
passed
off
as
a
belgiumstyle
dubbel
and
id
pair
it
with
food
with
this
in
mind
worth
future
purchases
cheers
overall
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
that
had
a
nice
bold
bitter
sweet
coffee
flavor
with
a
nice
hoppiness
at
the
end
drinkability
while
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
i
could
have
used
a
little
bit
less
of
the
dark
fruit
sweetness
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
nutty
flavor
along
with
the
malt
bottle
dates
on
label
not
punched
but
year
choices
are
11
and
12
so
ill
believe
its
fresh
pours
with
a
copperish
brown
body
and
a
decent
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
film
with
light
lacing
smells
sweet
and
sightly
boozy
with
a
bit
of
earthy
must
to
it
the
taste
is
straight
up
malt
with
a
bit
of
booze
in
the
aftertaste
really
pleasant
body
with
appropriate
carbonation
i
can
see
drinking
more
of
these
in
the
future
d
decent
probaby
could
only
have
a
few
at
a
time
but
still
a
great
beer
overall
a
pretty
standard
but
good
brown
ale
worth
a
try
super
easy
to
drink
just
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
d
i
couldnt
kill
a
6
pack
but
would
recommended
it
to
a
friend
any
day
d
session
yes
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
smooth
nice
moderate
body
in
this
brew
with
matching
carbonation
drinkability
is
great
a
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
d
very
drinkable
take
on
the
style
if
im
every
wanting
a
nice
brown
ale
chances
are
im
going
to
be
going
back
this
offering
from
smuttynose
i
wish
i
had
been
the
one
to
order
it
in
fact
i
only
tasted
my
friends
that
was
saturday
on
monday
we
went
to
buy
supplies
for
a
clone
of
it
i
didnt
notice
the
smellneither
good
nor
badso
im
going
to
dryhop
it
just
a
little
with
willamette
d
not
a
session
beer
but
drinkable
a
solid
beer
all
around
definitely
let
it
warm
up
some
before
drinking
for
better
results
d
very
average
i
was
expecting
much
more
from
this
one
i
think
that
ill
be
saving
it
to
share
with
the
inlaws
dthis
beer
isnt
bad
but
its
pretty
one
note
and
a
little
too
bitter
for
an
english
brown
pours
a
pretty
light
reddish
brown
for
the
style
not
much
head
quickly
goes
away
nice
nutty

also
some
chocolate
toffee

really
smooth

good

d
an
all
around
easy
to

simple

i
found
myself
thoroughly
enjoying

would
gladly
have
another

very

reviewed

the
drink
is
good
for
a
brown
being
that
it
is
actually
tasty
and
worth
drinking
very
easy
to
drink
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
very
good
brown
ale
it
was
perhaps
a
little
bolder
in
flavor
than
most
brown
ales
theres
a
picture
of
a
dog
on
the
label
presumably
named
olive
who
stares
at
you
sheepishly
as
you
drink
it
i
received
this
same
effect
from
after
consuming
a
few
too
many
barleywines
one
night
but
it
turns
out
that
this
time
the
dog
on
the
label
was
real
definitely
worth
a
look
not
smuttynoses
finest
but
definitely
an
above
average
brew
pours
a
perfect
teabrown
faintly
orange
and
murky
a
tannish
head
rings
quickly
but
stays
on
the
glass
im
picking
up
a
bit
of
detritus
as
well
as
a
hot
alcoholic
aroma
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
decent
hopped
bitterness
then
blends
into
some
sweet
and
very
slightly
sour
roastedtoasted
malts
decently
cocoalike
nicely
complex
in
all
the
finish
is
smooth
and
bitter
actively
carbonated
more
leaf
litter
for
the
aftertaste
but
that
seems
to
be
a
constant
among
the
smuttys
that
ive
tried
and
its
not
a
bad
thing
also
the
alcohol
being
about
at
its
max
for
the
styles
their
beers
can
sneak
up
on
you
a
good
drinking
english
brown
that
tastes
a
lot
better
than
its
first
impression
d
very
drinkable
good
taste
not
too
heavy
and
no
unwanted
aftertastes
quality
beverage
im
not
a
big
brown
ale
guy
but
this
ones
pretty
good
d
all
around
a
nice
beverage
especially
if
you
favor
malts
the
taste
combines
the
medium
roasted
flavors
and
hardshell
nuts
hopping
adds
a
little
leathery
earthen
bitterness
to
offset
the
malts
this
is
a
pretty
staright
forward
sweet
somewhat
syrupy
palated
beer
theres
balance
but
it
stays
well
within
style
a
nice
nh
session
brown
ale
for
your
consideration
drinkability
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
great
malting
easy
drinking
if
i
wasnt
such
a
beer
whore
id
put
this
one
in
regular
rotation
in
the
fridge
really
quite
satisfying
not
down
and
out
just
brown
drinkability
of
this
ale
is
very
high
considering
the
delicious
taste
and
wellbalanced
nature
decent
lacing
along
the
insides
of
the
glass
a
solid
offering
from
smuttynose
definitely
worth
a
try
enjoyable
but
not
remarkable
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
i
could
drink
this
regularly
but
only
at
a
certain
price
point
d
i
like
that
its
a
different
take
on
a
brown
but
not
a
lot
going
on
dm
very
slight
carbonation
smooth
drinking
great
complexity
leaves
a
lingering
maltiness
on
the
pallet
great
representation
of
the
style
d
no
problem
with
the
one
could
probably
have
another
a
great
everyday
brown
ale
a
very
solid
beer
that
went
well
with
the
burger
i
had
while
drinking
this
beer
i
had
higher
expectations
the
first
time
i
tried
old
brown
dog
second
time
around
wasnt
too
impressive
i
love
the
brown
ale
style
and
i
cant
put
this
at
the
top
although
its
not
horrible
theres
just
too
many
better
examples
of
the
style
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
overall
i
have
been
happy
with
pretty
much
everything
i
have
had
from
smuttynose
and
they
distribute
in
illinois
now
drink
a
fairly
decent
brew
that
might
work
out
well
for
a
session
i
was
surprised
and
the
amount
of
metallic
taste
but
it
was
still
decent
cheers
this
had
a
big
old
head
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
had
a
light
brown
color
with
no
lacing
around
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
i
smelled
some
caramel
maltiness
in
there
the
taste
is
also
malty
pretty
smooth
and
thick
the
alcohol
is
a
little
present
here
but
that
is
fine
with
me
overall
a
good
brown
ale
not
my
favorite
from
smuttynose
but
as
i
like
all
of
their
beer
thats
ok
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
with
a
good
dinner
id
like
to
have
this
again
this
is
from
a
sampler
pack
and
both
bottles
had
similar
flavor
just
a
bit
underwhelming
frankly
puts
a
warm
feeling
on
your
tongue
nice
beer
to
have
during
the
winter
time
if
you
dont
like
really
heavy
porters
or
stouts
its
not
bad
but
the
flavors
are
a
bit
strange
and
on
the
unusual
side
really
having
a
hard
time
with
this
one
not
completely
sure
what
to
make
of
it
an
interesting
take
on
the
english
brown
ale
style
flavorful
but
this
is
certainly
an
american
version
as
the
earthy
hops
come
on
a
little
too
aggressive
eclipsing
some
of
the
subtle
fruit
qualities
normally
present
in
an
english
brown
ale
d
highly
drinkable
being
less
dry
and
nutty
than
many
english
browns
this
ale
is
smooth
from
start
to
finish
with
loads
of
flavor
and
could
be
enjoyed
casually
had
this
on
tap
at
local
44
always
loved
this
one
finally
got
to
have
it
on
tap
showed
a
reddish
brown
with
frothy
white
head
and
decent
lacing
smell
sweet
malty
some
caramel
sweetness
balanced
by
some
bitterness
taste
bready
malts
up
front
some
dry
nuttyness
and
sweet
caramel
or
raisin
like
notes
balanced
by
some
dry
hops
loved
it
amazing
brown
ale
must
try
reddish
brown
with
garnet
hues
and
very
small
had
which
dissipated
quickly
smells
surprisingly
hoppy
for
an
english
brown
also
plenty
of
alcohol
and
toasted
malt
in
the
nose
begins
with
some
initial
hop
bitterness
and
is
quickly
follow
by
some
malty
sweetness
and
is
rounded
off
by
astringent
and
smoke
toasted
grains
which
also
impart
some
bitterness
overall
tastes
a
lot
darker
than
it
looks
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
interrupted
by
the
occasional
prickly
jolt
of
carbonation
the
hop
presence
was
certainly
a
surprises
an
easy
drinking
complex
brown
ale
in
what
is
otherwise
a
somewhat
imo
dull
style
well
worth
a
try
drinkability
after
just
drinking
a
boffo
brown
this
beer
is
a
much
sweeter
lighter
brown
while
the
boffo
is
almost
a
porter
this
beer
i
could
even
drink
in
hot
weather
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
was
strong
and
well
balanced
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
d
the
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
very
easy
i
think
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
i
could
drink
these
all
day
perfect
beer
for
the
current
weather
do
for
having
previously
not
cared
a
whole
lot
for
browns
i
found
myself
enjoying
this
one
immensely
could
and
would
drink
a
few
of
these
if
i
was
able
to
get
them
on
a
regular
basis
my
first
smuttynose
this
was
a
9
99
6pack
at
stop
and
shop
i
passed
over
it
several
times
but
i
will
be
going
back
to
it
it
is
very
close
to
sam
smiths
brown
ale
d
smooth
feel
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
definitely
have
plenty
of
these
in
one
sitting
pours
dark
cloudy
amber
burnt
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
nose
is
caramel
malt
earthy
hops
taste
is
sweet
toasted
caramel
malt
with
earhty
hops
palate
is
med
body
good
carbonation
smooth
creamy
texture
finish
is
sweet
malty
caramel
with
good
eathy
hops
for
balance
followed
by
some
nice
toasted
nutty
aftertaste
overall
a
very
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
brew
d
its
not
bad
per
se
but
ultimately
this
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
the
sweetness
becomes
cloying
by
halfway
through
the
glass
one
and
done
d
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
true
to
style
its
a
little
strong
to
session
but
having
a
couple
definitely
wouldnt
be
a
bad
time
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
english
brown
ale
check
this
one
out
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
it
had
some
nice
flavors
to
it
overall
and
went
down
pretty
easy
the
alcohol
showing
through
hurts
it
a
little
but
not
too
bad
pretty
solid
beer
overall
d
this
was
a
good
brown
ale
but
nothing
too
special
smell
and
taste
were
ok
and
it
had
nice
body
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
doesnt
rank
in
the
top
tier
of
brown
ales
for
me
12
oz
bottle
from
a
variety
pack
pours
hazy
amber
with
a
large
long
lasting
offwhite
head
aroma
of
bready
malt
and
some
fruit
medium
body
medium
carbonation
bready
malt
spicy
earthy
hops
and
some
dark
fruit
fill
the
mouth
long
dry
bitter
finish
not
bad
but
this
beer
reminds
me
more
of
an
amber
than
brown
very
solid
beer
for
sure
and
one
i
would
have
no
issue
in
going
back
to
again
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hops
taste
is
also
hops
a
front
a
bit
of
malts
and
grains
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
d
a
perfectly
good
ale
all
around
nicely
textured
and
flavored
it
certainly
doesnt
disappoint
i
would
have
liked
just
a
bit
more
complexity
in
the
taste
though
reddishbrown
in
color
the
head
fades
quickly
smells
sweet
with
some
caramel
malts
chocolate
and
some
roasted
characters
the
flavor
is
big
with
roasted
note
malts
touch
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
good
beer
if
you
like
malts
youll
love
this
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
notched
at
january
2011
pours
a
dark
hazel
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
some
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malts
bread
and
a
sweet
caramel
maybe
flavors
of
roasted
malts
and
a
hard
to
pinpoint
sweetness
slightly
bready
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
was
part
of
a
smuttynose
mix
12
pack
pretty
smooth
and
tasty
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
a
light
tan
head
nose
brings
toast
caramel
light
roast
hops
and
a
bit
of
earth
taste
is
slightly
toasted
bread
as
well
as
caramel
toffee
a
small
amount
of
dark
fruits
and
some
sweetness
good
mouthfeel
and
body
carry
the
flavors
drinks
quite
well
and
is
a
nice
american
take
on
the
style
pours
a
reddishbrown
slightly
cloudy
has
a
fizzy
onefinger
head
high
level
of
carbonation
seemed
odd
for
a
brown
ale
but
the
aroma
is
very
malty
as
expected
like
a
porter
almost
slight
hop
taste
a
bit
of
alchohol
taste
but
slight
roasted
caramel
malts
but
not
too
sweet
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
would
probably
be
even
better
ontap
at
a
bar
seems
like
a
decent
choice
with
food
or
just
by
itself
an
impressive
brown
ale
i
personally
prefer
turbodog
but
this
is
much
better
than
a
blander
choice
like
newcastle
for
a
smuttynose
beer
this
is
pretty
good
i
usually
have
not
been
impressed
with
that
brewery
before
it
has
a
nice
reddish
color
that
appears
to
be
a
bit
cloudy
the
taste
is
better
than
i
would
have
thought
this
is
deffinetly
not
a
cheaply
made
beer
i
can
pick
up
the
hop
flavor
which
is
not
over
done
for
this
style
of
beer
i
wish
there
was
a
little
less
malt
flavor
to
the
beer
it
almost
has
a
malt
liquor
flavor
while
i
would
not
run
out
and
buy
a
case
of
this
if
offered
another
i
would
drink
it
gladly
everything
about
this
beer
i
found
to
be
average
with
exception
to
the
smell
i
find
the
smell
of
this
beer
to
be
very
nice
after
tasting
this
i
think
i
will
give
a
few
other
smuttynose
beers
a
second
chance
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
smooth
not
too
thick
pretty
drinkable
even
though
i
usually
go
for
beers
that
showcase
hops
over
nutty
malt
smuttynose
makes
quality
beers
db
a
pretty
good
mix
of
brown
ale
flavors
but
the
spice
and
bitter
cocoa
presence
sort
take
away
from
it
it
throws
off
the
balance
a
bit
and
masks
some
of
the
nicer
malt
flavors
a
pretty
solid
beer
nonetheless
overall
very
solid
effort
by
smuttynose
definitely
give
it
a
go
if
you
get
a
chance
typical
of
a
brown
ale
the
beer
pours
with
little
foam
however
unlike
many
other
brown
ales
it
does
have
good
carbonation
the
taste
is
dominated
by
a
malt
with
a
caramel
taste
and
a
subtle
finish
of
hops
despite
not
having
a
taste
for
browns
this
one
takes
a
different
approach
and
produces
successful
results
a
murky
dark
brown
body
with
fleeting
bubbly
white
head
aroma
of
chocolate
notes
earth
hops
slight
roast
and
some
vague
gingerbread
flavors
of
chocolate
cocoa
krispies
slight
roast
earth
mild
spice
a
bite
of
a
sugar
cookie
medium
bodied
and
finishes
clean
with
only
a
slight
sugary
aftertaste
this
would
be
a
good
choice
for
the
fall
but
like
i
said
before
theres
not
enough
here
to
make
it
stand
out
from
the
other
brown
ales
out
there
its
a
bit
bolder
and
given
how
many
brown
ales
side
right
down
like
newcastle
thats
probably
a
good
thing
certainly
worth
a
shot
as
the
fall
approaches
this
brew
drinks
like
an
old
friend
solid
and
flavorful
without
overwhelming
you
on
any
front
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
all
around
well
crafted
beverage
a
good
english
brown
ale
just
disappointed
in
the
appearance
notes
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
well
crafted
brown
ale
with
nice
complexity
drinks
good
anytime
of
year
but
i
enjoy
this
most
right
when
the
summer
comes
to
end
begining
of
fall
a
simple
yet
exceptional
brown
ale
gotta
love
that
dog
on
the
label
too
gotta
love
the
label
of
this
brew
nutty
smells
and
a
real
taste
for
your
buck
this
is
an
inexpensive
but
honest
brown
ale
that
does
not
succumb
to
too
much
chocolatey
taste
or
weakness
and
it
pretty
much
tops
out
at
6
7
abv
making
it
a
go
to
winner
d
very
good
its
a
solid
brown
ale
with
an
abv
coming
in
6
7
hard
to
beat
d
a
great
and
complex
brown
ale
youll
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
with
18
inch
head
that
disappeared
quickly
the
aroma
is
caramel
with
hints
of
earth
plums
the
flavor
begins
with
toffee
followed
by
vanilla
bourbon
barrel
notes
balanced
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
an
increasing
warming
feeling
as
it
warms
very
pleasant
old
brown
dog
ale
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
session
beer
it
matched
well
with
extra
sharp
cheddar
chunks
recommended
good
to
see
this
guy
back
on
the
shelves
yesterday
it
pours
a
clear
garnetbrown
topped
by
nearly
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
the
nose
is
kinda
faint
with
notes
of
light
brown
sugar
dark
wheat
light
roasted
malts
light
maple
syrup
and
a
touch
of
greens
sliding
up
the
nose
eventually
the
taste
is
also
subdued
but
the
walnut
rye
bread
biscuit
brown
sugar
maple
syrup
and
greenery
notes
come
through
nicely
in
a
rather
pleasant
blend
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
a
very
tasty
and
very
highly
drinkable
brown
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
found
out
here
on
the
east
coast
alot
of
times
i
like
beersbut
they
are
expensive
and
i
dont
like
paying
for
them
i
dont
mind
paying
for
this
beer
because
i
feel
its
worth
the
money
drinkability
this
is
an
overall
terrific
brown
ale
that
features
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
character
and
a
beautiful
floral
hop
profile
to
satisfy
everybodys
needs
at
6
7
its
not
overwhelming
at
all
and
goes
down
with
little
hassle
the
only
gripe
i
can
find
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watered
down
which
isnt
a
big
deal
considering
the
fruity
finish
of
this
beer
really
compliments
the
malt
making
it
very
refreshing
overall
i
will
definetley
have
this
one
again
on
a
cool
autumn
night
for
a
brown
ale
at
6
7
abv
this
is
very
drinkable
if
not
quaffable
the
zesty
carbonation
and
balanced
flavor
keep
this
one
interesting
another
winner
from
this
brewery
pours
a
clean
and
clear
dulled
brown
color
minimal
cap
of
off
white
head
slight
lacing
scent
is
light
and
mixes
hints
of
roasted
nuts
carmel
malts
and
earthy
hops
taste
brings
more
of
what
the
scent
dictates
none
of
the
flavors
are
particularly
bold
but
they
work
together
nicely
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
slightly
overly
carbonated
for
the
style
a
decent
offering
but
lacks
the
umph
of
other
beers
in
the
style
f
finishes
still
pretty
sweet
with
lingering
malts
lots
of
brown
sugar
and
molases
little
stickiness
some
nutty
flavors
and
little
creamy
porter
like
nice
long
finish
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
dcrisp
and
smooth
nice
taste
which
does
not
linger
could
see
myself
with
more
than
one
of
these
unfortunately
i
only
bought
one
d
i
have
no
problem
enjoying
this
pint
and
well
ill
have
another
a
on
tap
selection
at
portsmouth
brewery
novare
res
in
portland
maine
for
those
just
discovering
the
style
seek
out
the
sumuttynose
old
brown
dog
ale
and
be
pleasantly
surprised
very
drinkable
a
good
fall
session
ale
drinkability
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
definitely
worth
a
try
i
would
like
to
have
this
one
again
pretty
standard
brown
ale
nothing
remarkable
but
still
a
drinkable
beer
i
am
beginning
to
question
the
quality
of
smuttynose
as
every
beer
i
have
had
from
them
is
average
or
below
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
brown
ales
this
is
also
jefes
favorite
beer
this
is
a
very
sessionable
great
tasting
brew
i
could
easily
go
through
a
ton
of
this
stuff
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
had
very
good
stuff
d
ohmigod
this
is
what
brown
ale
should
be
a
slightly
thin
finish
superbly
drinkable
and
flavor
of
the
most
complex
variety
notes
quite
a
solid
beer
and
a
great
session
beer
as
well
cheers
one
of
my
favorite
fall
back
beers
when
all
the
fancy
overwrought
beers
start
to
wear
you
out
get
a
pint
of
this
and
see
how
great
a
simple
malty
beer
can
be
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
light
and
tasty
without
overpowering
the
palate
a
good
way
to
start
off
the
night
overall
a
solid
beer
would
drink
again
but
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
needs
more
mouthfeel
and
richer
dark
malt
flavor
style
says
it
is
an
english
brown
but
it
seems
more
like
an
american
brown
fairly
bitter
and
little
to
no
fruit
characteristics
the
old
brown
dog
ale
pours
a
copperbrown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
up
top
and
not
much
lacing
smell
is
somewhat
sweet
with
sugar
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
some
raisins
are
also
present
taste
is
some
caramel
some
malts
some
sweetness
and
a
slightly
alcoholic
finish
pretty
good
tasting
beer
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
drinkability
is
solid
would
love
to
keep
this
in
my
fridge
if
it
were
available
to
me
excellent
mouthfeel
for
the
style
a
bit
higher
in
abv
than
youll
find
in
a
typical
english
brown
but
this
is
jampacked
with
flavor
while
maintaining
a
traditional
bent
i
could
enjoy
these
all
night
long
good
initiation
to
a
brown
ale
for
those
developing
their
palate
a
few
points
above
what
most
chain
brewpubs
might
offer
tastes
a
little
different
each
time
sometimes
its
wonderful
sometimes
its
an
effort
to
finish
12oz
bottle
pours
golden
brown
with
some
haziness
full
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
doughy
with
some
wet
leather
notes
medium
sweetness
with
some
sour
edges
medium
body
mouth
feel
on
the
thin
side
soft
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
goes
better
with
bready
foods
that
offset
the
sour
finish
the
medium
level
of
carbonation
and
low
to
medium
body
worked
well
but
the
tongue
drying
and
salty
quality
of
this
brew
was
a
little
off
putting
overall
a
little
less
hop
character
would
have
made
this
beer
more
drinkable
and
enjoyable
drinkability
great
easy
beer
to
have
after
a
long
day
at
work
one
of
my
favorite
browns
due
to
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
most
browns
ive
encountered
are
harsh
like
macrobrews
and
i
dont
usually
enjoy
them
smuttynose
is
usually
pretty
good
about
the
drinkability
of
all
their
beers
so
i
trusted
them
with
this
brew
d
very
drinkable
for
a
near
7
brown
ale
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
in
a
while
pours
a
clear
redbrown
with
thin
cream
colored
head
spotty
lace
smell
toasty
nutty
fruity
toffee
taste
vaguely
fruity
toasty
hazelnut
earthy
hopping
and
some
oat
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
and
fairly
dry
and
a
bit
minerally
as
befits
the
style
pretty
good
though
not
something
that
ill
likely
pick
to
make
mine
a
smutty
with
again
well
done
smuttynose
youve
largely
been
ignored
by
my
wallet
in
the
past
but
i
think
im
going
to
make
up
for
that
moving
forward
alcohol
is
a
little
high
for
the
style
but
the
beer
compensates
well
a
solid
b
nothing
fancy
here
but
happily
drinkable
d
it
is
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
moderate
hops
but
to
me
this
is
just
an
average
beer
its
not
easy
nor
hard
to
drink
d
such
a
clean
and
refreshing
beer
simple
and
tasty
but
with
enough
complexity
to
make
me
want
more
than
one
with
the
reasonable
abv
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
one
or
two
with
dinner
or
while
hanging
out
watching
the
game
another
beer
from
smuttynose
that
i
really
enjoyed
drinkability
a
combination
of
the
balance
and
the
mouth
feel
make
this
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
the
sort
of
beer
i
would
love
to
drink
a
few
of
in
an
evening
although
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
for
a
session
beer
definitely
fits
nicely
in
the
english
brown
ale
category
although
i
would
like
a
more
pronounced
aroma
otherwise
another
great
beer
from
smuttynose
drinkability
was
excellent
i
would
session
this
even
though
its
a
touch
over
session
strength
a
nice
brown
ale
and
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
evening
all
in
all
as
i
would
suppose
a
beer
like
this
should
be
judged
on
how
many
you
might
want
to
drink
well
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
couple
so
there
you
have
it
a
fine
enough
beer
even
if
it
doesnt
change
me
for
the
better
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
beer
and
will
probably
go
back
for
a
6pack
to
keep
in
the
fridge
theres
nothing
harsh
about
this
beer
its
one
that
i
feel
i
could
use
to
turn
noninteresting
beer
drinkers
on
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
had
this
on
tap
at
the
portsmouth
brewery
so
i
know
it
was
fresh
solid
brown
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
color
small
amount
of
foam
good
malty
flavor
has
almost
a
nuttycoffee
flavor
to
it
as
well
true
to
the
style
the
thing
about
most
brown
ales
i
have
had
is
it
is
tough
to
have
a
very
distinctive
flavor
with
a
brown
ale
but
you
can
tell
when
it
is
a
quality
brew
and
this
definitely
was
smuttynose
has
never
disappointed
me
thus
far
and
this
was
no
different
solid
brown
ale
old
brown
dog
was
the
first
offering
from
smuttynose
that
i
have
tried
and
i
was
satisfied
with
the
results
this
is
a
very
good
beer
easily
the
best
english
brown
ale
i
have
had
to
date
old
brown
dog
ale
is
another
solid
beer
from
smuttynose
quite
enjoyable
indeed
while
this
isnt
a
style
i
drink
on
a
regular
basis
this
would
be
a
uppertier
contender
when
the
mood
strikes
me
d
good
for
what
it
is
but
pretty
boozey
for
a
beer
that
doesnt
have
a
very
substantial
mouthfeel
imo
the
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
even
considering
this
is
a
style
that
tends
to
be
very
drinkable
this
one
stands
above
most
i
can
definitely
see
myself
picking
up
a
case
of
this
potential
goto
porter
this
fallwinter
d
in
the
day
of
bigone
off
rare
beersi
find
myself
gravitating
towards
more
sessionable
beers
or
maybe
i
am
just
gearing
up
for
summer
to
find
beers
that
i
can
drink
more
than
1
or
2
of
in
a
sitting
or
maybe
i
prefer
the
prices
of
the
more
session
type
beers
anyways
if
you
like
nutty
brown
ales
you
should
enjoy
this
if
youre
looking
for
something
totally
unique
and
off
the
charts
move
on
theres
nothing
to
see
here
feeldrink
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
nice
if
you
enjoy
it
i
didnt
buy
this
nor
would
i
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
good
d
i
could
drink
several
of
these
though
i
am
not
sure
i
would
like
to
as
i
think
you
could
find
a
better
brown
to
substitute
this
ones
quite
drinkablethough
that
alcohol
kick
deceives
one
into
thinking
its
got
a
higher
abv
than
it
does
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
a
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
to
me
this
is
a
typical
nut
brown
ale
nothing
really
standouts
as
something
special
again
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
not
memorable
pours
a
hazy
copper
like
color
with
about
an
inch
of
fluffy
head
with
a
bit
of
a
yellow
tint
to
it
lite
lacing
on
the
glass
some
carbonation
but
not
a
lot
very
hoppy
and
malty
flavor
this
beer
has
lots
of
flavor
but
nothing
i
can
really
single
out
very
enjoyable
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
overall
a
decent
brown
of
the
english
varietypretty
true
to
the
style
although
a
bit
thinbodied
for
my
tastes
three
bottles
of
this
come
as
part
of
the
variety
pack
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
brown
color
with
a
large
white
head
good
amount
of
lacing
smell
was
earthy
and
just
a
hint
smoky
taste
was
very
enjoyable
lots
of
malt
flavor
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
would
have
loved
to
have
seen
just
a
bit
more
body
in
this
beer
drinkability
is
high
considering
this
is
a
6
7
beer
which
is
well
hidden
a
great
local
example
of
a
sessionable
brown
ale
d
solid
brown
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
a
good
representation
i
would
recommend
it
d
a
nice
straightforward
brown
ale
very
sessionable
i
feel
though
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
or
cloying
fullness
it
is
looking
like
a
very
good
brown
session
ale
and
this
taste
only
helps
the
drinkability
although
not
a
light
beer
any
alcoholic
trace
is
mitigated
by
a
fantastically
powerful
taste
had
this
on
cask
at
my
favorite
local
pub
dark
drown
in
color
almost
zero
lacing
in
my
tulip
smells
of
cinnamon
and
dried
fruits
tastes
of
dried
fruits
not
that
hoppy
or
malty
but
rather
complex
easily
drinkable
i
could
put
around
4
of
these
down
slighty
carbonated
at
the
perfect
cask
temp
pours
a
very
hazy
almost
muddy
dark
bronze
with
warm
red
edges
a
small
head
that
settles
to
a
collar
very
distinct
cocoa
powder
aroma
with
toasted
and
woodsy
notes
taste
is
sweeter
than
the
nose
would
suggest
in
a
pleasant
way
with
strong
toffee
and
chocolate
notes
blending
nicely
with
a
roasted
nut
element
and
an
light
earthy
bitterness
individually
these
flavors
have
depth
together
they
have
harmony
overall
this
beer
is
a
symphony
in
a
bottle
im
in
awe
of
its
taste
d
fantastic
brew
as
of
this
review
its
definitely
my
favorite
in
its
style
very
sessionable
regardless
of
the
time
of
year
part
of
a
variety
pack
purchased
feb
22nd
in
case
youre
looking
for
it
didnt
overwhelm
me
but
it
was
quite
tasty
and
ive
always
found
brown
ales
a
great
beer
for
any
and
all
occasions
this
is
rock
solid
and
a
beer
i
wish
made
it
to
colorado
medium
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
feel
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
fairly
simple
and
enjoyable
beer
happy
presidents
day

5
d
plenty
good
here
id
love
to
have
another
if
i
ever
get
to
have
this
again
ill
hopefully
get
a
better
looking
batch
clear
clean
amber
brown

with
golden
brown

tightbubbled

nose
of

of

flavors
up

slightly
nutty

and
fruit
notes
take
over
midpalate
mildly

with
hints
of

even
a

toasted
roasted
bitterness
in
the
finish
with
chocolate
accents
mediumbodied
with
a
somewhat
sticky
feel
not
bad
pretty
standard
brown
ale
nothing
remarkable
but
still
a
drinkable
beer
i
am
beginning
to
question
the
quality
of
smuttynose
as
every
beer
i
have
had
from
them
is
average
or
below
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
brown
ales
drinkability
overall
this
is
very
balanced
and
quite
refreshing
would
pair
well
with
roast
or
burgers
or
some
sweet
dessert
d
yummy
but
not
extraordinary
example
of
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
smuttynose
can
do
no
wrong
goes
down
easy
tasty
but
not
exceptional
its
a
rubymahogany
brown
color
with
a
slight
haziness
light
tan
head
didnt
last
too
long
theres
a
roasted
nuttiness
in
the
smell
along
with
caramel
and
slight
chocolate
this
sounds
weird
but
i
also
got
a
peppered
beef
jerky
scent
as
well
nutty
taste
as
well
along
with
bitter
chocolate
theres
the
slightest
hint
of
citrus
at
the
very
end
this
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
but
i
dont
go
out
searching
for
brown
ales
as
a
side
note
i
drank
one
of
these
straight
from
the
bottle
and
actually
thought
it
tasted
better
a
little
bolder
ymmv
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
nice
malty
smell
caramel
taste
is
also
malty
toasty
and
caramelly
significant
hop
presence
herbal
earthy
and
somewhat
citrusy
very
nice
full
bodied
mouthfeel
the
flavors
work
together
very
well
in
this
slight
alcohol
warmth
quite
drinkable
an
interesting
and
very
good
brown
ale
bb
burger
at
the
grill
and
this
beer
just
got
better
as
it
warms
but
they
drink
so
easy
they
never
really
last
after
taking
a
second
look
at
this
one
im
hooked
drink
id
have
to
say
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
if
you
like
it
i
didnt
care
for
it
much
but
it
did
go
down
easy
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
dated
may
2010
sampled
on
january
14
2010
it
pours
a
rich
brown
color
with
thin
to
little
head
but
excellent
clarity
the
aroma
is
a
bit
off
putting
yeah
there
is
a
nuttiness
with
a
dose
of
hops
and
malts
but
it
also
has
this
kind
of
sweaty
aroma
not
the
best
aroma
i
have
smelled
but
the
taste
rescues
it
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
nuttiness
and
a
fresh
hoppiness
in
the
background
except
for
the
aroma
in
this
particular
bottle
i
found
it
to
be
a
nice
beer
and
one
that
i
often
have
i
am
sure
glad
i
did
the
color
was
beautiful
and
brown
the
head
was
rather
white
for
a
brown
ale
while
it
lasted
lacing
was
half
decent
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
an
english
ale
and
was
very
inviting
nuts
light
chocolate
bread
and
caramel
that
tops
this
old
dog
off
i
will
be
picking
more
of
this
one
up
soon
truly
a
great
example
of
a
classic
brown
ale
from
the
us
smooth
tasting
light
in
the
belly
and
on
the
pallet
i
could
really
put
quite
a
few
more
of
these
down
if
i
had
more
than
one
over
all
the
beer
is
very
true
to
the
style
it
gets
the
job
done
and
quality
is
not
compromised
i
give
it
high
marks
for
doing
everything
it
was
supposed
to
and
not
pissing
on
my
taste
buds
good
dog
pours
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
nutty
with
some
english
malts
as
well
the
flavor
is
that
of
a
traditional
english
brown
ale
with
some
biscuit
and
caramel
malt
as
well
as
some
toasted
nuts
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
solid
medium
body
with
crisp
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
want
more
conclusion
im
honestly
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
its
kind
of
got
the
dry
nutty
character
of
a
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
with
the
fruity
esters
of
a
newcastle
with
stronger
minerally
notes
and
a
pretty
stout
dry
hoppiness
on
the
finish
im
not
really
sure
if
that
all
comes
together
to
make
a
good
beer
its
interesting
and
a
different
take
on
the
style
for
sure
but
its
only
moderately
successful
imo
a
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
english
brown
theres
nothing
too
intense
anywhere
here
and
its
not
offensive
in
any
way
abv
is
high
for
sessioning
great
beer
walking
the
line
between
usuk
brown
ale
and
highlighting
the
best
aspects
of
both
this
is
a
great
example
of
balance
this
shows
a
solid
dark
tea
colored
brew
with
a
decent
tan
head
and
an
excellent
uniform
blanket
of
lacing
the
aroma
brings
light
caramel
molasses
with
crisp
wheat
nuances
the
flavor
brings
velvetty
malt
toffee
with
very
light
carbonation
theres
a
polite
citrus
bitterness
with
wheaty
character
throughout
it
has
a
distinct
raspberry
hint
and
a
bit
of
raisin
it
is
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
good
for
most
any
occasion
ive
been
looking
for
a
great
introduction
to
the
brown
ale
style
and
i
havent
really
find
my
beer
yet
this
a
relatively
simple
brown
ale
with
a
toasted
malt
profile
that
is
not
intense
as
some
stouts
easy
to
drink
but
not
mind
blowing
cant
wait
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
or
on
tap
recommend
trying
this
or
any
of
smuttys
beers

12
oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
rather
sugary
the
flavor
is
very
similar
with
lots
of
sweet
malt
and
nothing
much
else
yep
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
the
initial
taste
was
alright
but
the
after
taste
wasnt
very
good
the
beer
just
seemed
to
end
and
i
was
left
with
this
boring
taste
in
my
mouth
if
the
initial
taste
followed
all
the
way

been

satisfied
with
this
random
purchase

of

with
light
notes

quite
enjoyable
taste
is
a
nice
enough
mix
between
some
deep
rich
caramel
malt
with
cereal
and
a
light
subtle
touch
of

hops
are
not
very
apparent
which
might
be
a
good
thing
considering
the
nice
malt

i
like
this
beer
i
think
sometimes
this

can
be
a

a

a

too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
this
is
a
simple
but
delicious
brew
that
is
very
forward
with
the
chocolate
malt
and
is
wellworth
a
try
and
with
all
those

available
on

it
probably
would

and
inoffensive
it
would
be
easy
to
put
back
several
of
these
beers
some
evening
another
winner
from
smuttynose
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
session
beer
for
lovers
of
the
style
overall
impression
wellbalanced
and
tasty
brown
ale
d
this
was
an
okay
beer
for
me
i
enjoyed
the
the
aroma
and
the
finish
of
this
beer
it
really
gets
better
as
it
warms
a
solid
beer
to
try

with
a

foamy

diminishes
fairly

to
a
film
that
sticks
around
for
quite
a

nice
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
roasted
malts
chocolate
nuts
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
except
less
sweet
than
the
nose
suggests
and
theres
anearthy
bitterness
on
the
finish
along
with
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruit
theres
a
little
bit
of
a
musty
cardboard
taste
coming
in
late
that
i
dont
care
for
but
its
mild
and
easy
to
ignore
the
nutty
character
seems
to
build
after
several
sips
it
has
a
medium
body
moderately
dry
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
nothing
really
impressed
me
but
its
a
solid
offering
d
its
pretty
mellow
with
some
good
unexpected
flavors
nonetheless
its
missing
something
i
prefer
american
brown
ales
and
i
think
some
stronger
hops
would
help
but
its
still
fine
this
is
a
very
rich
and
flavorful
beer
with
very
nice
balance
although
its
a
little
more
towards
the
malty
side
a
very
easy
drinking
great
all
around
beer
a
good
beer
that
reminds
me
of
a
heavy
marzen

brown
but
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
ones
i
have
had
to
date
of
this
style
i
also
appreciatte
the

a
bit
higher
than
most
browns
ale
d
pretty
drinkable
english
brown
ales
arent
exactly
my
favorite
style
in
the
world
but
this
is
quite
a
good
example
of
the
style
definitely
worlds
better
than
newcastle
so
for
appearance
is
pretty
good
my
first
pour
was
nice
and
slow
and
the
head
was
just
over
one
finger
the
color
was
a
solid
straight
brown
and
little
haze
the
smell
wasnt
overwhelming
but
it
was
a
typical
brown
ale
aroma
the
taste
had
some
nutty
smoky
taste
but
it
was
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
i
like
it
d
very
drinkable
a
nice
old
brown
ale
here
certainly
drinkable
and
would
be
nice
to
have
on
hand
all
the
time
pours
a
beautiful
dark
redbrown
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
is
retained
for
quite
a
while
smells
mostly
of
malt
with
a
little
carameltoffee
hints
has
a
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
and
is
rather
sweet
with
a
clean
finish
taste
is
predominantly
of
toasty
malts
with
little
hoppiness
very
drinkable
delicious
ale
if
a
little
lacking
in
complexity
easily
a
sessionable
beer
and
especially
for
you
big
malt
fans
out
there
a
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
brown
ale
definitely
worth
returning
to
a
well
executed
english
northern
brown
style
with
an
american
brown
strength
im
beginning
to
think
smuttynose
would
become
a
staple
for
me
if
i
lived
in
their
area
of
distribution

poured
into
dimpled
mug
poured
a
dark
amber
to
brown
color
with
a
half
finger
head
that
quickly
diminished
toasty
aroma
lets
you
know
that
you
will
be
experiencing
a
nice
hoppy
bite
and
there
is
no
disappointment
drinks
very
thin
with
a
nice
dry
hop
bite
to
finish
d
very
sessionable
english
brown
ale
this
beer
poured
a
nice
clear
ruby
tinged
brown
with
no
real
head
to
speak
of
a
small
film
sits
on
top
of
this
beer
with
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
of
caramel
and
toffee
malts
and
a
hint
of
hazelnut
taste
is
starts
with
some
sweet
brown
sugar
lending
in
to
the
caramel
malts
mixed
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
toffee
malts
in
the
finish
lighter
body
high
carbonation
goes
does
easily
clean
feel
with
a
dry
finish
to
it
some
what
sweet
aftertaste
to
it
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
that
i
could
sit
with
for
a
bit
but
the
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
may
get
to
me
after
a
bit
decent
enough
brew
not
big
not
exciting
not
complex
not
deadly
points
but
the
thinness
unexciting
taste
leave
me
dry
on
this
one
but
a
brown
thats
palatable
easy
to
drink
really
great
fall
beer
even
though
i
am
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
this
is
a
really
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
notes
this
and
the
star
island
single
from
the
same
mix
pack
certainly
impressed
me
not
much
of
a
head
a
little
bit
of
lace
and
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
amber
showing
against
the
light
faint
aroma
of
malt
with
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
pleasant
but
not
wowinducing
taste
is
also
pleasant
but
maybe
a
little
too
much
grain
showing
through
the
malty
flavors
were
there
but
just
didnt
come
through
for
me
i
would
have
like
some
more
depth
and
character
felt
decent
enough
but
loses
a
point
just
because
it
didnt
seem
to
reach
every
point
on
my
palate
its
quaffable
and
has
a
pleasant
flavor
but
i
really
wanted
this
beer
to
be
more
than
it
was
definitely
something
i
could
down
as
a
session
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
very
malty
but
still
extremely
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
amberbrown
color
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
it
is
very
airy
and
lacks
any
sort
of
complexity
the
taste
is
fuller
than
the
aroma
but
still
not
as
burly
as
one
would
expect
from
a
brown
ale
there
is
some
nice
toffee
and
hints
of
dark
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
beer
could
stand
to
gain
a
lot
but
it
isnt
though
i
guess
i
could
drink
it
again
but
there
are
so
many
quality
brown
ales
out
there
that
i
cant
see
myself
making
it
back
to
this
beer
anytime
soon
d
high
for
a
brown
ale
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
from
smuttynose
overall
a
well
crafted
brown
ale
or
any
ale
for
that
matter
has
a
nice
complexity
and
would
definitely
buy
again
drinkability
i
would
say
its
quite
drinkable
its
thick
and
it
may
compliment
something
semisalty
like
honey
roasted
nuts
or
like
caramel
popcorn
its
very
sweet
not
overwhelmingly
but
sweet
and
malty
nonetheless
an
occasional
beer
t
has
a
strong
flavor
to
it
quite
malty
cant
drink
a
lot
of
it
because
it
is
pretty
heavy
but
definitely
a
solid
brew
d
a
spectacular
brown
ale
and
an
incredible
value
this
is
a
great
food
beer
nothing
like
a
wellmade
brown
ale
like
this
to
pair
with
a
juicy
burger
at
the
pub
also
this
is
an
awesome
beer
to
pair
with
a
spicy
beef
brisket
sandwich
a
remarkably
wellmade
beer
in
its
own
right
youll
be
happy
you
paid
so
little
for
a
beer
like
this
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
brown
ales
i
have
tried
very
enjoyable
overall
a
delightful
brown
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
long
long
time
completely
sessionable
by
many
and
really
helps
you
refine
your
respect
and
admiration
for
brews
that
have
subtlty
like
this
the
mouthfeel
in
this
beer
isnt
what
i
expectedsomewhat
watery
howeverthis
really
adds
to
the
drinkability
this
beer
goes
down
like
nothingnot
like
its
a
bad
thing
though
just
easy
to
drinkand
enjoyable
d
moderate
a
solid
brown
ale
flavorful
and
drinkable
would
buy
again
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
brown
ale
personally
i
think
ellies
from
avery
is
just
a
scoche
better
but
this
will
do
just
fine
the
bottle
i
had
was
notched
august
09
so
i
didnt
get
the
freshest
example
of
this
offering
but
it
was
still
stellar
smuttynose
does
good
work
and
i
look
forward
to
tasting
more
of
their
styles
slightly
watered
down
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
amount
of
bitter
hops
up
front
that
are
quickly
balanced
by
a
chocolatecaramel
malt
presence
the
body
is
way
too
thin
in
this
beer
and
i
found
the
flavor
kind
of
boring
i
think
ill
stick
with
the
bigger
version
really
old
brown
dog
drinkability
relatively
high
a
nice
tasting
beer
with
solid
flavors
that
isnt
too
big
the
price
was
nice
too
about
a
buck
sixty
for
a
bottle
other
this
may
be
my
favorite
brown
ale
paired
it
with
some
locally
smoked
cheddar
yesterday
it
was
an
amazing
combo
o
would
buy
again
for
food
pairing
mainly
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
nice
beer
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
complex
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
of
a
let
down
im
not
very
knowledgeable
when
it
comes
to
brown
ales
but
i
figured
id
pick
this
one
up
as
im
trying
to
learn
a
bit
more
about
the
style
imho
this
beer
is
just
as
good
if
not
a
bit
better
and
more
complex
than
the
famous
samuel
smith
brown
ale
sweet
and
malty
nutty
and
pleasantly
bitter
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
noticeable
warming
alcohol
particularly
as
it
comes
to
room
temperature
despite
of
its
relatively
pedestrian
abv
an
excellent
nocompromise
everyday
beer
particularly
when
you
feel
like
taking
a
break
from
the
hopbombs
that
we
all
seem
to
enjoy
so
often
another
great
offering
from
smuttynose
this
brown
ale
pours
a
cloudy
dark
mahogany
color
with
thin
cream
colored
head
roasted
malts
caramel
and
some
coffee
notes
dominate
the
scent
of
the
beer
the
taste
is
very
nutty
and
sweet
with
just
enough
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
this
has
a
very
smooth
almost
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
slight
to
moderate
carbonation
making
this
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
right
now
highly
recommended
with
red
meat
or
as
a
desert
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
in
to
a
pint
glass
lively
head
but
minimal
lacing
smelled
of
roasted
malt
taste
was
mild
and
good
with
earthy
and
roasty
flavors
with
just
enough
hops
that
it
balances
beautifully
mouthfeel
is
average
nothing
remarkable
drinkability
is
excellent
mild
but
great
flavor
not
too
potent
int
he
abv
went
great
with
grilled
ribs
slathered
with
bbq
sauce
d
goes
down
very
easy
the
malt
flavor
hangs
around
great
brew
i
have
nothing
to
complain
about
i
could
easily
kick
these
back
all
night
wish
we
had
distribution
so
i
was
very
surprised
by
the
high
score
of
this
beer
i
must
say
my
taste
buds
may
be
off
its
summer
ive
been
drinking
a
keg
of
brooklyn
summer
ale
ill
have
to
come
back
to
this
beer
and
try
again
in
a
week
or
two
part
of
the
smuttynose
mixed
12
pack
pours
a
nice
redwood
color
good
to
head
it
not
much
for
lacing
on
the
glass
though
nice
nutty
smell
to
it
taste
has
a
nice
initial
mouthfeel
to
it
a
bit
on
the
light
bodied
side
but
very
smooth
and
drinkable
nice
balance
in
this
one
not
too
much
hops
by
any
means
nice
and
drinkable
a
bit
of
a
warming
alcohol
kick
to
it
surprising
for
the
low
abv
of
this
beer
an
above
average
brown
ale
pretty
good
beer
to
quaff
down
in
the
mixed
pack
but
still
loving
their
ipa
this
beer
is
almost
blood
red
with
a
touch
of
brown
theres
a
tiny
bit
of
light
brown
head
that
disipated
quickly
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
chocolate
malt
the
flavor
is
very
smooth
and
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
tones
with
a
slight
hop
tartness
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
it
simply
glides
down
the
throat
this
was
a
very
good
brown
ale
i
would
put
in
my
top
3
favorite
brown
ales
ive
ever
tried
d
good
as
a
smooth
drinker
this
would
be
something
that
could
be
had
more
than
once
d
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
english
brown
but
the
style
doesnt
lend
itself
to
the
bold
flavors
that
smuttynose
is
famous
for
but
its
smooth
flavor
and
high
drinkability
will
appeal
to
both
bas
and
beer
newbies
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
and
two
finger
beige
head
the
smell
is
candysweet
lightly
toasted
malt
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
caramel
sweet
malt
that
gives
way
to
a
slight
burst
of
hops
that
compliments
it
very
well
and
a
bit
of
smokiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
marries
taste
with
good
drinkability
a
great
example
of
the
style
one
of
my
favorite
smuttys
this
is
a
wonderful
brown
ale
very
representative
of
what
a
brwon
ale
should
be
get
my
hands
on
it
serving
type
bottle
purchased
from
canals
pours
a
translucent
coffee
color
with
a
cotton
candy
head
sexy
lacing
excellent
spicy
scent
punctuated
with
tartness
and
bacon
amazing
biscuity
palate
maybe
a
little
cilantro
and
plum
creamy
mouthfeel
and
long
finish
d
this
was
a
very
good
representation
of
a
brown
ale
and
left
me
wanting
more
thank
goodness
i
bought
the
variety
12
pack
because
i
think
there
are
2
more
flavor
is
great
round
and
full
this
is
a
damn
malty
brown
ale
that
has
layers
of
toffee
syrup
and
caramel
rich
malt
character
with
a
slight
bit
of
roast
as
well
very
mild
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
fine
behind
the
scenes
carbonation
despite
the
richness
of
this
ale
drinkability
is
quite
high
a
great
interpretation
of
the
brown
ale
style
i
like
it
overall
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
brew
glad
i
got
more
than
one
in
the
trade
d
a
very
good
brown
ale
i
think
they
did
an
awesome
job
brewing
this
beer
i
will
try
this
beer
again
overall
a
really
good
brown
ale
with
nice
malt
flavor
d
good
one
to
drink
a
couple
pints
of
at
the
local
bar
its
nothing
special
but
is
usually
pretty
good
i
really
enjoyed
everything
about
this
beer
not
too
over
the
top
great
taste
and
mouth
feel
and
highly
drinkable
i
could
enjoy
just
one
or
a
few
pours
a
brownish
amber
color
as
you
would
expect
it
has
a
malty
dry
taste
with
a
sweet
smell
carbonation
is
just
right
to
complete
the
experience
ontap
at
the
old
dominion
brewpub
this
one
was
a
really
nice
surprise
a
nice
brown
brew
with
your
standard
good
brown
flavors
big
earthy
malt
flavors
caramel
and
some
cookies
then
mixed
nicely
with
lightly
spiced
fruity
hops
a
nice
medium
sized
beer
that
id
get
again
drinkability
is
red
flag
warning
take
care
now
exceptionally
good
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
well
balanced
overall
d
brown
ales
are
some
of
my
favorites
to
drink
with
pizza
this
one
would
be
a
first
to
grab
for
pizza
night
if
it
were
readily
accessible
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
an
iced
teaish
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
light
beige
head
that
settles
into
a
thick
collar
active
carbonation
a
rich
aroma
of
malt
caramel
bread
and
toffee
arises
during
the
pour
and
hangs
in
the
air
beautiful
1st
sip
brings
all
the
caramel
bread
and
toffee
to
the
tastebuds
with
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
thrown
in
theres
a
nice
hit
of
hops
on
the
aftertaste
which
gives
balance
to
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
medium
smoothness
and
its
as
sessionable
as
it
is
tasty
ive
heard
a
lot
about
smuttynose
beers
and
wondered
if
they
were
the
real
deal
or
just
hype
believe
me
theyre
the
real
deal
smuttynose
old
brown
dog
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
mostly
malty
a
touch
of
cocoa
is
noticeable
but
there
is
a
surprising
amount
of
hops
for
the
style
that
are
noticeable
as
well
the
flavor
also
has
a
touch
of
cocoa
lots
of
nutty
flavor
and
a
nice
amount
of
hops
a
really
enjoyable
brown
ale
im
glad
we
finally
have
it
here
in
florida
as
it
was
a
go
to
beer
when
i
lived
up
north
excellent
session
beer
poured
into
the
center
of
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
has
a
reddishbrown
color
and
a
good
sized
head
of
offwhite
bubbles
the
head
dies
down
to
a
thin
coating
leaving
a
coating
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
there
isnt
much
aroma
to
this
beer
jsut
a
hint
of
something
toasted
there
are
some
hops
and
bittnerness
to
the
taste
but
nothing
overpowering
i
can
also
detect
toasted
molasses
the
best
way
to
describe
it
is
that
it
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
who
says
you
cant
use
the
term
youre
defining
in
the
definition
it
has
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
lighttomedium
body
im
not
generally
a
fan
of
browns
but
i
like
this
beer
real
nice
english
brown
ale
appearance
of
this
beer
is
a
nice
amber
brown
color
and
very
clear
the
smell
is
a
mild
roast
aroma
the
taste
is
a
wonderful
malty
roasted
sweetness
with
no
real
hop
notes
the
mothfeel
is
thin
to
medium
its
the
kind
of
brown
ale
to
sit
and
drink
a
pitcher
of
with
a
nice
large
pizza
and
some
friends
d
very
drinkable
mild
brown
ale
a
nice
solid
brown
ale
i
drank
it
too
cold
great
brown
and
i
just
dont
like
them
tastes
a
lot
hoppier
than
expected
if
the
india
brown
ales
are
ipa
meets
brown
ale
this
is
amber
ale
meets
brown
ale
its
hoppier
and
lighter
than
a
brown
ale
its
delicious
but
off
putting
maybe
because
i
was
expecting
a
nutty
malty
brown
ale
and
thats
not
what
i
got
its
good
and
i
will
probally
drink
it
again
from
time
to
time
but
still
its
offputting
drinkability
sipping
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
and
savored
ill
be
having
more
of
this
beer
but
probably
not
more
than
one
or
two
an
evening
poured
from
a
bottle
in
to
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
brown
amber
color
the
brown
is
the
main
color
which
is
supported
by
amber
tones
and
swirls
threw
the
beer
forms
a
pretty
good
head
with
an
off
white
color
to
it
the
aroma
is
very
nice
and
refreashing
with
dark
fruits
and
caramel
malts
pushing
threw
the
flavors
where
great
and
i
feel
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
dried
fruits
caramel
and
toffee
power
this
brew
the
carbonation
fits
perfect
with
the
brew
and
helps
force
flavors
threw
out
the
pallet
the
brew
is
well
balanced
and
can
be
easily
had
in
a
session
3
take
away
most
of
the
diacetyl
and
fruitiness
add
some
coffee
astringents
and
youve
got
a
sam
smith
clone
perhaps
to
style
but
not
my
thing
would
prefer
more
texture
and
a
chewy
sweetness
would
be
nice
lastly
havent
yet
looked
at
the
abv
but
a
pitty
if
above
5
as
that
would
defeat
the
purpose
if
you
are
searching
for
loyalty
unconditional
love
and
companionship
in
a
beer
then
its
likely
old
brown
dog
ale
is
the
best
candidate
for
the
job
it
is
a
tasty
sessionable
consistent
and
well
crafted
ale
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
rank
amongst
the
best
in
show
for
its
style
if
only
smuttynose
would
throw
me
a
bone
and
distribute
it
a
little
further
i
didnt
love
the
smell
but
i
know
im
not
a
big
malt
smell
person
its
an
amber
brown
with
a
thin
bubbly
lacing
very
malty
aroma
and
taste
grains
roasted
nuts
maybe
a
smidge
of
chocolate
that
ends
with
a
caramel
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
like
it
should
be
with
so
much
malt
creamy
and
not
a
dry
beer
at
all
better
review
than
i
expected
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
the
beer
stop
for
around
1
75
poured
into
my
shaker
glass
and
appears
a
clear
medium
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
quickly
fading
light
tan
head
smells
and
tastes
of
roasted
grains
tree
nuts
hints
of
hazelnut
toasty
bread
sweet
malts
and
the
slightest
touch
of
cocoa
a
notch
above
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
a
pleasantly
drinkable
english
brown
pours
a
medium
brown
with
some
amber
hues
a
small
head
and
average
lacing
the
smell
is
roasted
malts
with
some
mild
nutty
hints
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
but
more
prominent
with
roasted
malts
and
nutty
flavors
also
some
musky
earthy
flavors
are
present
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
from
the
malt
backbone
but
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beverage
i
tend
to
like
the
the
more
hoppy
american
brown
ales
but
i
truly
enjoy
this
offering
from
smutty
definitely
an
easy
drinker
not
too
complex
mild
but
great
flavor
profile
another
great
one
from
smuttynose
overall
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
that
leans
more
toward
the
toasted
end
of
the
spectrum
as
opposed
to
the
buttery
end
which
im
a
fan
of
certainly
worth
a
shot
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
easy
to
keep
drinking
if
you
are
so
inclined
it
poured
a
nice
big
head
almost
too
big
seeing
as
it
was
trying
to
jump
out
of
the
glass
mostly
my
fault
i
took
care
of
that
with
a
giant
slurp
now
that
it
has
settled
down
a
bit
its
a
nice
dark
amber
its
light
and
smooth
as
any
brown
ale
should
be
with
a
nice
dry
hoppy
finish
smelled
sweet
and
hoppy
its
quite
like
any
brown
ale
that
i
would
like
to
have
very
mild
and
is
kind
of
an
anytime
kind
of
beer
d
super
drinkable
brown
ale
great
flavors
keep
coming
and
wanting
you
to
throw
back
more
of
this
beers
goodness
mild
enough
to
get
a
few
down
without
difficulty
would
expect
this
to
be
awesome
on
tap
yumm
pretty
much
everything
a
brown
should
be
tasty
and
ver
drinkable
i
havent
had
browns
in
a
while
so
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
its
wonderful
to
have
smuttynose
available
here
as
there
ipa
is
one
of
the
better
of
its
style
ive
had
and
old
brown
dog
does
not
dissapoint
final
thoughts
this
beer
seems
to
be
one
of
their
staples
and
its
for
obvious
reasons
i
really
disliked
smuttynoses
pumpkin
seasonal
and
didnt
give
them
a
fair
chance
to
prove
themselves
since
i
bought
the
mix
pack
i
have
been
enjoying
them
more
and
more
great
brown
ale
one
of
my
new
favorites
try
wychwood
hobgoblin
for
a
fuller
bodied
english
brown
drinkability
quite
drinkable
very
pleasurable
session
beer
mdmouthfeel
was
a
little
astringent
from
alcohol
whose
presence
dont
belong
here
but
not
watery
as
american
brewers
of
browns
are
sometimes
are
guilty
of
drinkability
is
perfective
heard
a
lot
of
complaints
that
this
style
is
boring
but
smuttys
take
seems
more
dynamic
than
most
not
sure
boring
and
simplicity
are
synonomous
but
whatever
anyway
i
like
it
all
together
not
bad
this
is
my
first
english
brown
and
while
not
unpleasant
to
drink
i
found
somewhat
hohum
this
may
be
more
indicative
of
the
style
than
an
indictment
of
this
specific
beer
d
quite
drinkable
with
a
very
nice
caramel
flavor
this
doesnt
stand
out
for
its
complexity
but
as
a
brown
ale
it
really
shouldnt
the
malt
dominates
but
never
becomes
cloying
and
the
hops
balance
the
beer
without
getting
in
the
way
d
ive
been
away
from
brown
ales
far
too
long
this
is
superbly
drinkable
in
all
honestly
it
probably
falls
by
the
wayside
of
many
other
sessionable
beers
but
the
nuance
of
this
rather
tame
beer
are
incredible
and
it
would
be
an
easy
choice
for
sessioning
a
beer
i
hope
to
revisit
d
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
brown
ale
that
is
tasty
and
is
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
recommended
overall
a
decent
beer
fairly
typical
brown
reliable
or
boring
you
be
the
judge
d
very
nice
very
smooth
very
easy
drinking
brown
ale
omg
this
is
a
brown
ale
wow
this
one
is
really
worth
trading
for
reassurance
that
all
american
takes
on
european
styles
are
not
overhopped
and
overly
boozy
this
has
the
comfortable
feel
of
a
good
uk
ale
with
just
enough
bite
at
the
end
to
add
some
distinctive
character
nice
shiny
amber
color
with
a
decent
fluffy
head
marvelously
malty
nose
which
anticipates
a
mildly
toasted
lightly
smoky
taste
plenty
of
malt
of
course
but
not
too
much
and
theres
just
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
taste
a
tiny
bit
tart
affordable
and
definitely
one
to
keep
on
hand
not
unlike
fullers
1845
bit
lower
in
abv
but
shares
many
of
the
same
malty
characteristics
poured
this
beer
into
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
copper
color
with
medium
head
there
is
some
lacing
somewhat
biscuit
like
aroma
drier
malt
flavor
with
some
nice
bittering
hops
medium
to
full
mouth
feel
that
sit
niceley
right
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
nice
balnce
for
an
american
brown
pours
a
very
nice
deep
brown
with
some
good
initial
head
and
some
very
nice
lacing
nice
scent
very
sweet
and
malty
though
not
as
deep
as
i
like
in
my
browns
good
taste
nice
and
nearbalanced
with
a
good
lean
towards
the
sweet
malty
side
again
though
not
as
deep
and
thick
as
i
like
but
good
goes
down
very
very
smoothly
though
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
session
brew
and
definitely
goes
down
as
an
above
average
example
of
the
brown
ale
style
d
this
is
a
heavy
beer
i
found
it
to
be
very
filling
and
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
beer
that
you
would
drink
in
the
colder
seasons
perhaps
with
a
hearty
meal
such
as
beef
stew
or
chili
i
could
drink
this
all
night
i
am
beginning
to
feel
like
smuttynose
wants
to
invoke
all
day
drinking
all
of
their
products
are
dangerously
drinkable
especially
as
they
warm
up
very
impressive
brewery
served
a
dark
crisp
amber
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
that
left
very
spotty
lacing
aroma
was
brown
malts
and
slight
cocoa
the
taste
was
nutty
brown
malts
and
some
pine
hops
in
the
finish
with
a
slight
bitterness
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
slight
carbonation
a
little
heavy
for
the
style
and
abv
this
is
a
good
beer
for
when
the
mood
hits
for
a
brown
ale
d
very
solid
brown
ale
that
has
a
good
amount
of
drinkability
to
it
this
beer
goes
down
easy
is
smooth
as
hell
and
tastes
really
good
its
overall
solid
in
all
categories
and
goes
over
very
well
it
might
be
a
bit
on
the
simple
side
but
i
like
that
from
a
brown
ale
overall
i
think
this
works
well
and
is
quite
enjoyable
this
one
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
cloudy
almost
opaque
mahogany
brown
malty
aroma
has
hints
of
spices
and
molasses
rich
flavor
is
mainly
malty
and
has
tones
of
cloves
and
molasses
as
well
as
a
hint
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
silkysmooth
texture
leaves
a
tasty
and
pleasant
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
that
represents
the
english
version
with
a
slight
new
england
twist
appearance
is
a
cloudy
amberred
with
a
shortlived
head
having
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
rather
mild
but
mostly
grainy
with
a
slight
malt
sweetness
present
taste
begins
with
the
sweetness
from
the
malts
and
is
followed
by
bitterness
of
the
hops
finish
is
dry
and
grainy
too
much
so
for
my
taste
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
smooth
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
one
could
easily
have
several
of
these
but
overall
is
a
bit
too
simple
for
me
to
desire
more
than
one
the
hops
brought
into
effect
make
this
an
original
take
on
a
classic
style
whereas
most
brown
ales
seem
to
be
a
little
too
sweet
and
overbearingly
malty
this
one
takes
an
opposit
direction
and
sometimes
seems
to
light
my
critique
is
i
would
ask
for
a
little
more
maltyroastednutty
deepness
otherwise
nice
refreshing
and
an
enjoyable
brew
a
nice
well
balanced
beer
nice
and
tasty
d
the
hops
overpower
the
malt
backbone
a
little
bit
to
the
point
where
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
too
many
of
them
dr
very
good
i
could
do
more
of
these
tasty
this
would
be
killer
with
some
fish
and
chips
i
initially
tried
this
beer
because
there
was
a
cool
dog
on
the
label
but
it
has
since
become
an
standby
the
beer
pours
a
rich
brown
with
almost
no
head
smell
is
toasty
with
caramel
with
maybe
a
faint
orange
the
taste
is
a
a
toasted
chocolate
with
a
warming
bite
from
the
alcohol
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
a
safe
bet
from
my
local
brewery
d
this
is
a
tasty
little
number
ive
been
really
impressed
with
everything
smuttynose
has
offered
me
so
far
and
intend
on
continuing
drinking
their
offerings
daltough
somewhat
sweet
ther
dryness
helps
make
this
one
sessionable
overall
highly
sessionable
beer
not
a
bad
crossover
either
i
will
absolutely
reach
for
this
when
im
craving
some
welldone
malts
this
is
a
nice
little
treat
from
smuttynose
it
really
exemplifies
the
style
by
showing
nuance
and
complexity
without
reaching
past
the
parameters
that
define
brown
ales
a
really
pleasant
drink
from
start
to
finish
fresh
malt
taste
with
pinpoint
hop
bitterness
this
could
easily
be
a
got
to
brown
ale
for
me
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
light
brown
almost
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
colalooking
head
the
smell
is
malt
forward
with
subtle
hints
of
floral
hops
the
maltiness
is
a
combination
of
sweet
crystal
coffee
and
slightly
toasted
biscuity
malt
the
smell
is
a
good
representation
of
the
taste
strong
malty
backbone
with
the
toasted
malt
and
light
coffee
flavor
dominating
with
a
solid
hop
augmentation
to
make
for
a
smooth
tasting
easy
drinking
beer
there
is
also
a
slight
alcohol
presence
that
adds
to
the
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
is
a
little
thin
and
has
a
slight
mouth
burning
sensation
overall
a
drinkable
beer
nothing
too
outstanding
but
not
a
bad
beer
either
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
thin
but
thats
really
not
a
big
deal
considering
the
flavor
and
high
level
of
drinkability
overall
another
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
i
recently
had
a
newcastle
brown
ale
this
is
clearly
a
superior
brew
d
i
can
do
about
2
of
these
before
i
need
to
raise
the
flag
easy
drinker
though
a
touch
strong
for
a
session
beer
you
can
easily
wind
up
doing
just
that
d
this
one
goes
down
very
easily
ive
been
impressed
with
most
of
the
smuttynose
offerings
ive
tried
so
far
and
this
one
is
no
different
a
solid
brown
ale
a
good
old
brown
dog
is
hard
to
come
by
but
when
youve
got
one
youll
know
it
this
is
a
good
one
whos
a
good
boy
whos
a
good
boy
you
are
arent
you
yes
you
are
yes
you
are
ok
thats
just
getting
creepy
now
but
this
is
a
good
brown
and
i
could
session
this
anytime
almost
two
finger
offwhite
cream
colored
head
slow
to
dissolve
with
good
lacing
amber
red
to
brown
in
color
you
get
some
orange
around
the
rims
soft
gauzy
opacity
the
nose
brings
you
caramel
butterscotch
maple
syrup
and
fig
to
raisin
fruit
without
ever
feeling
sweet
quiet
enough
nostril
presence
that
the
flowers
grains
oats
and
roasted
chestnuts
waft
through
swiftly
nothing
falls
out
of
place
intelligently
arrayed
in
the
mouth
its
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
strongest
during
entry
as
this
recedes
the
butterscotch
toffee
fig
date
flavors
come
forward
evenkeeled
yeast
dough
notes
more
coffee
than
chocolate
although
neither
major
smooth
with
a
creamy
fluidity
neither
fast
nor
slow
to
move
forward
d
pretty
drinkable
but
i
think
one
at
a
time
is
about
the
limit
as
it
is
really
quite
full
tasting
and
feeling
for
the
style
making
it
on
the
edge
of
getting
cloying
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
na
zdravje
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
and
goes
does
extremely
smooth
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
pints
very
easily
and
enjoy
doing
so
the
sweetness
is
not
overdone
in
my
opinion
a
nice
little
dry
finish
balances
it
out
a
very
good
brown
ale
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
definitely
solid
and
not
lacking
in
any
department
drinkability
is
exceptional
good
beer
but
did
not
succeed
in
keeping
my
attention
throughout
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
good
brew

overall
good
intensity
on
flavors
but
not
so
overpowering
that
it
would
keep
you
from
having
more
than
one
delicious
and
one
for
the
22
oz
as
youll
open
a
second
12
oz
anyway
served
into
a
smuttynose
pint
glass
i
just
figured
it
would
feel
more
at
home
after
a
warm
up
for
about
fifteen
minutes
out
of
the
fridge
poured
mahogany
with
a
sparing
offwhite
head
that
died
to
a
splotchy
covering
quickly
a
bit
hazed
from
what
appeared
to
be
some
sediment
that
came
out
at
the
end
of
the
pour
a
nice
toasty
nut
aroma
jumps
out
at
me
with
some
light
roast
and
sweet
fig
slightly
vinous
malt
flavors
to
start
with
some
chocolate
and
toast
caramel
and
a
bit
of
roast
in
the
finish
maybe
a
touch
of
spicy
hop
mixed
in
there
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
with
a
soft
carbonation
drinks
pretty
easy
with
some
good
darker
malt
flavors
and
a
nice
balanced
english
feel
this
bottle
was
passed
its
prime
by
a
bit
the
aroma
showed
up
the
flavors
i
have
tasted
this
in
better
shape
and
know
that
it
is
a
very
good
beer
it
just
didnt
show
its
best
tonight
nice
brown
ale
here
pours
with
a
ginger
aroma
and
a
rich
brown
appearance
tastes
a
bit
ginger
roasted
caramel
toffee
this
is
a
very
very
good
effort
but
there
are
some
better
brown
ales
out
there
although
i
may
be
a
bit
partial
considering
that
i
own
a
chocolate
labrador
retriever
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
wasnt
exactly
the
best
brown
ale
that
ive
had
would
take
a
ng
fat
squirrel
or
gi
nut
brown
over
it
any
day
d
easy
on
the
palate
while
still
being
tasty
hv
a
tasty
satisfying
brown
from
smuttynose
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
just
didnt
impress
me
that
much
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
not
much
carbonation
very
drinkable
but
a
touch
sweet
i
continue
to
be
impressed
with
smutty
this
one
was
a
touch
on
the
earthy
and
hoppy
side
of
things
for
what
i
was
in
the
mood
for
but
it
was
an
impressive
brew
beautiful
with
an
outstanding
aroma
and
perfect
mouthfeel
a
hint
more
of
the
caramel
sweetness
and
vanilla
aroma
on
the
palette
and
this
one
would
be
near
perfect
still
an
outstanding
brew
and
definitely
worth
trying
a
very
good
brown
from
this
side
of
the
pond
if
you
like
browns
this
beer
will
not
dissapoint
a
good
well
rounded
english
brown
ale
recommended
would
drink
again
extremely
drinkable
and
sessionable
one
of
the
most
pleasant
offerings
ive
come
across
recently
i
should
try
more
of
these
and
to
think
the
only
reason
i
picked
it
up
is
cause
my
4year
old
riding
in
the
shopping
cart
thought
the
picture
of
the
dog
was
cool
d
this
is
hugely
drinkable
and
spanks
most
other
english
browns
my
guess
is
that
it
would
be
superbly
sessionable
never
tried
one
before
this
single
i
am
going
out
to
buy
a
few
sixes
of
this
to
keep
on
hand
smuttynose
beers
have
just
recently
arrived
in
the
triangle
region
of
north
carolina
i
picked
up
a
bomber
of
their
brown
ale
on
a
whim
this
one
pours
a
dark
nutty
brown
with
a
shortlived
tan
head
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malts
caramel
and
a
distinct
nuttiness
waft
up
from
the
brew
with
each
intense
sniff
the
flavor
is
superb
it
contains
elements
of
roasted
malts
intense
nutty
flavors
a
mild
sugary
sweetness
just
a
trace
of
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
finish
and
a
lingering
malty
aftertaste
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
ever
come
across
period
so
many
tend
to
focus
on
the
darker
dry
style
this
one
is
sweeter
and
has
a
stronger
brown
essence
simply
delicious
nothing
wrong
with
this
brew
but
id
much
rather
have
a
sam
smith
before
this
this
is
just
a
little
bit
better
than
newcastle
a
true
pleasure
to
drink
pours
a
soapy
head
that
disappated
quickly
smells
of
tarty
plums
and
fruity
esthers
smell
is
nice
taste
a
bit
overdone
really
tart
flavours
come
through
with
nice
bitterness
at
the
end
to
round
out
dont
know
if
the
bottle
was
too
young
or
what
but
i
was
not
overly
impressed
with
this
one
i
will
try
it
again
without
hesitation
but
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
either
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
very
pleasant
color
of
brown
it
has
a
medium
sized
white
head
and
the
beer
itself
is
some
what
transparent
to
light
the
smell
is
of
sweet
barley
the
beer
has
a
bready
goodness
to
it
not
overly
sweet
a
light
bodied
beer
that
is
well
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
fairly
clean
in
the
finish
a
bit
dry
as
well
browns
are
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
this
one
was
okay
its
a
good
session
beer
but
i
would
prefer
something
else
good
for
a
brown
smuttynose
never
fails
me
they
continually
release
flavorful
drinkable
beers
its
a
very
consistent
excellent
brewery
this
is
a
solid
allaround
brown
ale
definitely
one
to
pick
up
if
you
run
across
it
the
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
and
fills
the
mouth
without
attacking
it
a
very
pleasant
quaff
a
tad
strong
to
drink
more
than
a
few
but
those
few
will
go
down
oh
so
easily
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
example
of
an
brown
ale
especially
by
an
american
brewery
a
well
made
drinkable
beer
smooth
creamy
and
a
little
sweet
bu
dry
at
the
finis
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
with
a
creamy
three
finger
head
smells
of
thick
rich
malts
with
hints
of
darker
roasted
malts
wow
delicious
in
the
mouth
layers
of
malt
with
crisp
roasted
flavors
of
particular
intrigue
malts
are
balanced
nicely
with
a
snap
of
hop
bitterness
overall
a
really
nice
and
distinctly
american
brown
ale
i
fear
some
of
the
poorer
reviews
are
due
to
less
than
fresh
samples
out
of
a
smuttynose
sampler
pack
that
my
dad
bought
pours
dark
brown
with
a
little
whitish
head
and
intermittent
lacing
smells
malty
nondescript
taste
is
a
sweet
maltiness
slightly
interrupted
by
a
rush
of
carbonation
some
vague
chocolate
hint
of
a
grassy
hop
in
the
background
medium
bodied
not
bad
but
not
particularly
memorable
this
beer
poured
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
didnt
bother
to
stick
around
the
aroma
was
malty
and
somewhat
sour
the
taste
was
malty
and
very
typical
brown
ale
like
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
sour
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
to
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
overall
this
is
an
average
brown
ale
for
some
reason
it
doesnt
seem
that
this
beer
came
together
flavors
just
didnt
meld
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brown
that
i
will
return
to
this
was
just
soso
ive
heard
good
things
about
smuttynose
but
this
was
not
all
that
memorable
worth
a
shot
and
id
have
another
just
ended
up
being
a
bit
murkytasting
for
my
taste
nothing
really
stood
out

this
one
pours
a
fairly
clear

color
there
was
a
bit
of

dropped
away
rather
quickly
there
is
a
nice
nose

a

to
me
not

going

but
nothing
really
seemed
to
shine
either
every
drink
made
me
want
one
more
a
great
combination
of

flavors
gave
off
a
caramel

nutty
taste
very
smooth
texture
and
very
easy
to
drink
no
stand
out
hops
or

which
was
a
big
plus
just
a
very
solid
beer
that
had
it
right
a

would
be
perfect

it

just
about

plenty

is
pretty
good
would
be
a
bit
higher
if
the
sweetness
were
toned
down
d
unfortunately
since
the
smuttynose
porter
is
so
good
most
will
pass
this

by
for

more
acclaimed
big
brother
however
this
is
a
very
good
beer
in
its
own
right
d
a
fantastically
sessionable
brown
ale
that
hits
all
the
right
marks
and
manages
to
be
an
immensly
satisfying
beer
while
following
a
simple
and
tidy
course
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
small
foamy
head
on
a
dark
amber
body
smelled
floral
very
sweet
and
very
caramelly
taste
was
exactly
the
same
with
medium
hoppiness
coffee
flavor
poked
through
as
it
warmed
came
across
as
kinda
flat
admittedly
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
really
didnt
find
anything
overly
exciting
about
it
pours
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
nice
tan
head
with
some
staying
power
and
a
nice
bit
of
lacing
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
with
a
good
compliment
of
a
spicey
hoppy
flavor
with
sweet
malty
notes
it
is
however
a
little
too
sweet
and
sugary
its
a
decent
beer
though
and
i
wouldnt
pass
one
up
if
offered
khaki
colored
head
dissipated
quickly
barely
retains
a
tiny
ring
that
laces
surprisingly
well
for
as
lacking
as
it
is
clear
cherry
wood
color
soft
sweet
malt
aroma
augmented
by
a
fresh
leather
hint
with
very
very
subtle
hops
undertones
beneath
more
depth
in
the
flavors
than
the
aroma
suggests
roastedtoasted
grains
toffee
and
caramel
notes
nicely
balanced
moderate
to
high
carbonation
with
a
good
but
not
great
mouthfeel
the
hops
finish
is
pronounced
and
pleasantly
cutting
a
very
good
brown
ale
drinkability
this
one
is
very
drinkable
because
it
tastes
so
damned
good
its
a
bit
heavy
which
keeps
it
from
being
perfect
but
wow
im
impressed
a
great
brown
ale
i
had
this
on
cask
this
evening
once
and
for
all
it
pours
a
browninsh
amber
with
a
slight
white
head
the
smell
is
of
nuts
and
malts
the
flavor
is
very
nice
with
a
nice
nutty
flavor
this
cask
was
dry
hopped
so
you
get
a
nice
hop
flavor
as
well
there
is
also
alof
of
nice
malt
flavors
to
fill
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
cask
well
done
the
feel
is
gritty
and
chewy
but
also
creamy
and
milky
leaves
a
milky
film
a
nice
gritty
brown
ale
full
of
flavors
though
they
are
a
tad
on
the
roughharsh
side
still
not
bad
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
all
in
all
pours
translucent
brown
with
a
medium
head
and
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
fairly
strong
solidly
dark
malt
the
flavor
is
pleasant
and
slightly
sweet
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
base
a
little
smoke
a
little
wood
there
is
a
pleasing
astringency
on
the
finish
that
clings
ever
so
slightly
to
the
tongue
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brown
ale
as
comfortable
dependable
and
mellow
as
an
old
brown
dog
d
decent
brew
with
moderate
alcohol
not
interesting
enough
for
me
to
session
though
itd
be
a
candidate
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
a
classic
example
of
truetostyle
american
craft
beer
even
though
its
an
english
brown
ale
its
well
done
with
surprising
subtleties

tasting
it
doesnt
bombard
the
taste
buds
and
the
taste
doesnt
linger
too
long
not
bad
pours
with
a
tight
freshlooking
head
atop
a
body
of
light
molasses
brown
wonderful
aroma
redolent
of
bread
crust
rich
caramel
malts
and
some
light
earthy
hops
just
a
touch
not
offputting
of
bandaid
on
the
palate
surprisingly
thick
on
the
tongue
with
light
carbonation
the
first
impression
is
of
sweet
malts
followed
by
a
crusty
baked
note
and
a
parting
note
of
herbal
bitterness
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
english
brown
ale
although
i
would
have
appreciated
a
bit
less
alcohol
and
a
bit
more
sessionability
still
very
well
done
d
drinks
alright
but
there
are
better
browns
d
i
regret
buying
only
one
serve
it
with
grilled
food
and
rich
sauces
or
by
itself
for
a
dessert
no
matter
just
make
sure
you
try
this
beer
some
time
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
very
rich
and
full
tasting
tons
of
roasty
caramelly
malt
but
not
overly
sweet
where
you
can
only
handle
one
or
two
carbonation
seemed
little
high
for
the
style
but
worked
for
me
a
solid
dark
brown
ale
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
bit
brighter
since
it
was
a
tad
lighter
and
i
could
see
though
the
glass
a
tad
more
carapils
for
better
head
retention
would
have
been
nice
also
but
this
beer
is
definitely
tasty
in
a
good
way
i
dont
know
about
the
english
brown
ale
classification
i
would
more
consider
it
an
american
brown
ale
because
i
detected
a
nice
hop
bite
a
nice
version
of
the
style
though
as
others
have
said
it
is
a
bit
thin
bodywise
love
the

slight
roasted

this
is
a
damn
good
brown
ale
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
a
very
solid
drinking
brown
ale
perhaps
one
of
the
best
ive
had
succeeds
huge
in
the
taste
department
where
other
iconic
english
browns
newcastle
tend
to
be
a
bit
lighthearted
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
tan
creamy
head
with
good
retention
and
solid
lacing
aromas
of
roasted
malt
caramel
and
dark
fruit
the
up
front
taste
is
of
hops
which
get
taken
over
by
molasses
and
roasted
malt
then
finish
bitter
with
a
sweet
malty
aftertaste
the
alternating
flavors
or
bitter
sweet
are
wonderfully
balanced
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
medium

and
light
to

this

great

medium

good

for
its
uniqueness
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
surprised
me
a
bit
d
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
carbonation
withstanding
worth
rereviewing
pours
a
rich
auburn
brown
with
a
bubbly
light
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
froth
pleasantly
crisp
the
flavor
is
molasses
and
coffee
not
too
sweet
not
too
bitter
it
seems
wellbalanced
and
crisp
a
very
friendly
drinkable
beer
i
think
it
might
be
nice
with
grilled
meats
or
barbecue
d
thanks
to
drdogbeer
for
this
one
this
is
quite
refreshing
and
nicely
balanced
d
a
nice
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
makes
this
beer
pretty
drinkable
good
beer
overall
definitely
worth
a
session
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
a
slight
coolness
of
alchohol
noted
as
well
too
good
this
is
a
beer
that
could
get
me
in
trouble
i
had
4
in
1
5
hours
had
to
switch
it
up
d
it
was
an
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
beer
it
had
a
great
malt
base
decent
mouth
feel
and
modest
abv
making
it
a
good
candidate
for
a
long
session
another
great
offering
from
smutty
always
a
safe
bet
and
a
staple
in
my
fridge
a
great
session
beer
perfect
to
pair
with
a
variety
of
foods
or
to
enjoy
on
its
own
pours
a
dark
amber
medium
brown
color
with
plentiful
offwhite
head
aromas
are
full
of
toffee
chocolate
dark
caramel
very
tootsieroll
like
no
hop
notes
detected
flavorwise
much
the
same
a
robust
bready
and
chocolaty
mouthfilling
flavor
dominates
carbonation
is
medium
low
and
the
finish
is
malt
heavy
but
not
very
sweet
very
little
in
the
way
of
fruit
esters
which
is
more
indicative
of
an
english
style
and
abv
puts
it
out
of
style
as
well
however
it
isnt
hopped
to
american
standards
so
it
doesnt
really
fit
either
style
though
it
is
a
delicious
brown
and
a
very
easy
drinker
my
next
one
was
this
pours
a
deep
copper
brown
color
w
a
thin
offwhite
head
which
lasts
a
while
leaving
a
moderate
lacing
in
my
glass
a
light
smell
mostly
dark
caramel
malts
and
fruits
w
a
faint
alcoholic
note
in
the
finish
a
dry
tart
and
nutty
flavor
w
a
mild
hop
bite
and
some
faint
raisondate
undertones
a
bit
of
floral
hop
flavor
in
there
as
well
drinks
a
bit
thicker
than
your
avg
eng
brown
co2s
right
just
a
little
too
full
bodied
to
make
it
a
4
a
quite
drinkable
brew
an
excellent
session
beer
ill
def
have
this
one
again
poured
a
leathercouch
brown
into
my
mug
with
decent
carbonation
and
minimal
head
a
good
malty
smell
with
something
like
bread
and
other
malts
nothing
specific
coming
out
on
top
of
hops
with
very
minor
citric
notes
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
coffee
roasted
and
toffee
malts
all
seemingly
coming
out
caramel
andor
honey
in
there
too
to
round
out
the
mediumslightly
heavy
body
goes
down
smooth
with
a
semisweet
finish
as
the
hops
appear
to
add
a
little
fruitinessapples
or
cherries
and
on
the
backbite
for
slight
dryness
this
is
a
quality
beer
and
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
find
it
a
bar
buy
a
round
and
if
youre
lucky
to
find
a
sixpack
buy
it
and
split
with
buddies
a
deep
amber
and
chestnut
color
with
a
quater
inch
high
head
that
is
beige
in
color
a
strong
nutty
fragrance
with
malty
sweetness
with
the
scent
of
cherries
at
the
end
the
malty
sweetness
rolls
across
the
palate
with
caramel
and
nutty
flavors
and
finishing
with
a
mild
bitterness
of
grass
at
the
end
a
medium
bodied
at
the
front
it
gains
a
more
hefty
feel
as
it
rolls
across
the
palate
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
the
strong
flavor
and
aroma
makes
me
want
to
get
out
the
grill
and
through
a
steak
on
because
this
would
be
great
with
a
steak
poured
into
miniheffe
glass
at
08
long
island
craft
brew
festival
earth
brown
and
thick
and
foamy

at
the

disapated
into

partial
cap

mild
hops
and
sweet
caramel
character
david
yarrington
the
master
brewer
told
me
that
it
was
too
cold
that
day
due
to
being
inside
a
hockey
arenacooler
rather
than
at
a
bar
but
it
still
was
mighty
fine
and
was
5
2abv
not
5
7
a
single
malt
base
with
malty
backfinish
and
again
mild
hops
excellent
mixture
will
grab
for
this
one
without
a
second
thought
the
next
time
dark
red
amber
appearance
with
eventual
good
lacing
their
were
slight
malts
smelled
but
nothing
too
noticeable
the
taste
had
a
better
sense
with
the
malt
taste
and
offered
a
good
spicy
kick
to
it
weak
body
but
it
was
still
a
little
smooth
to
drink
overall
it
was
just
decent
md
my
favorite
brown
ale
has
been
dogfish
heads
indian
brown
but
that
is
a
bit
more
bulkier
in
taste
body
and
alcohol
the
old
brown
dog
on
the
other
hand
is
a
very
drinkablesession
type
beer
with
a
great
flavor
d
highly
drinkable
would
make
a
great
session
beer
imo
for
the
price
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
better
brown
ale
the
taste
is
nice
and
rich
and
at
5
7
its
not
your
typical
low
alcohol
session
brown
ale
its
got
a
lot
of
malt
taste
with
a
hoppy
tanginess
that
comes
through
at
the
finish
a
solid
brown
ale
and
another
great
yearround
release
from
smutty
d
not
bad
but
not
an
all
time
favorite
a
solid
offering
that
im
happy
i
tried
but
not
sure
i
would
seek
out
again
taste
is
predominately
roasted
malt
with
a
decent
chocolate
presence
some
nuttiness
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
for
a
brown
ale
which
is
something
that
is
often
lacking
notes
i
have
tried
a
few
brown
ales
and
my
love
with
beer
began
with
a
trip
to
the
brooklyn
brewery
in
which
i
tried
their
brooklyn
brown
ale
and
as
they
say
the
rest
is
history
a
pretty
solid
drinkable
brown
ale
definately
on
the
upper
end
of
the
americanmade
english
browns
could
definitely
see
this
one
making
a
return
to
the
fridge
rotation
drinkability
very
good
beer
in
the
style
american
brown
ale
not
bad
for
a
brown
ale
more
of
a
mid
fee
butl
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
body
for
style
overall
though
i
am
impressed
with
a
easy
drinking
beer
to
drink
night
after
night
d
the
beer
had
great
drinkability
from
start
to
finish
and
enjoyable
in
multiples
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
sufficient
carbonation
drinkability
is
still
hampered
for
me
by
the
amount
of
darker
malt
flavor
in
this
oneits
all
very
good
and
i
highly
recommend
especially
if
you
like
darker
malts
but
i
couldnt
have
two
or
more
of
these
in
a
row
good
stuff
from
smuttynose
worth
a
shot
this
is
one
good
session
brew
or
for
a
tasty
treat
dark
brown
body
with
brown
threefinger
head
befitting
a
rootbeer
head
settles
quickly
slightly
opaque
light
fruity
esthers
with
a
malt
balance
that
is
pleasant
slightly
effervescent
palate
that
tucks
into
the
tongue
with
a
medium
body
a
nice
compliment
to
a
meal
or
fine
as
a
standalone
always
looking
for
a
solid
brown
ale
i
believe
smuttynose
to
have
crafted
this
nicely
with
a
combination
of
mellowness
and
substance
to
be
honest
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
beer
i
knew
not
to
expect
sam
smiths
nut
brown
ale
maybe
the
finest
example
of
this
style
but
i
thought
it
would
at
least
be
as
good
as
new
castle
it
was
drinkable
enough
and
although
it
could
be
a
good
session
beer
id
rather
drink
new
castle
not
too
impressed
and
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
what
happened
this
is
a
pretty
fresh
bottle
best
by
date
is
listed
as
a
whole
6
months
from
now
so
i
doubt
its
a
bad
batch
m
d
smooth
drink
rather
slick
and
finishing
quite
clean
just
shy
of
what
i
might
session
but
then
again
perhaps
not
an
enjoyable
drink
and
im
going
to
follow
this
one
up
with
another
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
an
off
white
short
head
that
laces
the
glass
very
nicely
it
has
an
aroma
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
and
a
hint
of
nut
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
very
good
with
the
roasted
malt
base
balanced
out
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
followed
up
with
a
sweet
nutty
flavoring
that
makes
this
beer
very
nice
it
has
a
good
crisp
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkability
is
good
as
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
d
very
good
if
a
bit
smoky
i
will
be
having
at
least
two
when
i
go
back
for
bingo
night
decent
beer
that
i
would
have
again
but
nothing
i
would
search
out
d
good
example
of
the
brown
ale

and
very
sessionable

good

i
had

it

even
if
my
homebrewed
brown
ale
did
beat
it
side
by
side
drinkability
not
the
most
diverse
beer
out
there
but
did
however
have
session
written
all
over
it
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
these
that
is
one
that
wasnt
expired
for
at
least
5
months
that
was
my
fault
i
forgot
i
had
it
smuttynose
old
brown
dog
ale
is
overall
an
excellent
beer
the
rich
brown
apperance
and
the
light
head
make
for
a
nice
look
the
appearance
really
shows
its
full
bodied
flavor
the
smell
is
rich
and
dark
with
hints
of
nutchocolate
and
carmel
the
taste
is
slightly
on
the
bitter
side
but
highly
rich
and
full
the
mouthful
is
crisp
for
the
richness
of
a
beer
with
very
little

is
not
even
a
question

stage
the

moderate

i
wouldnt
call
it
a
smooth
brown
ale
as
it
has
an
initial
malty
bitterness
but
it
finishes
fairly
neutral
a
good
brown
ale
definitely
worth
a
try

extra
hoppy
brown
ale
nicely
balanced
between
sweetness

as
much
head

i
expected
solid

hoppy

and
tasted
mainly
of
piney
hops
nothing
special

pleasant
enough

i
shouldnt
expect
too
much
from

watermark
that
i
had
last
drank
from
flavor
was
fairly
two
dimensional
with
some
caramel
and
mildest
hazelnut
finished
slightly
sweet
with
a
medium
body
an
easy
conversation
beer
give
these
guys
props
for
not
going
crazy
with
the
hops
and
not
being
to
sweet
with
the
malts
this
beer
would
go
well
with
grilled
red
meat
pours
a
cola
brown
solid
inch
tan
head
that
slowly
settles
to
a
thin
cover
mild
carbonation
the
aroma
is
full
rich
sweet
and
smooth
along
with
the
flavor
rich
sugary
malts
up
front
with
a
very
well
balanced
hop
finish
perfect
english
brown
ale
malty
and
rich
with
a
subtle
yet
apparent
aroma
hop
added
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
a
great
brown
ale
imo
overall
one
of
the
better
browns
ive
had
and
another
excellent
brew
from
sn
im
not
sure
if
my
bottle
was
a
fluke
or
if
its
normally
carbonated
like
this
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
but
its
still
a
nice
tasting
beer
certainly
worth
drinking
if
you
like
the
style
drinkability
great
session
beer
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
creamy
beige
head
that
reduces
fairly
quickly
but
leaves
a
nice
lacing
behind
pleasant
smells
of
caramel
and
it
seems
perhaps
candied
dates
and
figs
the
taste
is
a
knockout
sweet
toasty
malts
again
reminiscent
of
candied
dark
fruits
and
toffee
hints
of
alcohol
and
a
nice
little
hoppy
twinge
in
the
finish
satisfying
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
i
could
certainly
drink
this
all
night
an
outstanding
brown
ale
one
i
feel
lucky
to
be
able
to
find
regularly
living
in
new
england
you
have
to
down
this
one
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
though
theres
really
no
point
in
drinking
it
straight
from
the
icebox
d
easy
to
drink
almost
too
easy
which
i
think
is
a
reflection
of
its
thin
light
body
pleasant
but
rather
simple
just
had
this
at
the
publick
house
in
boston
last
night
was
definitely
and
above
average
beer
i
ordered
a
burger
and
asked
the
waiter
for
a
good
compliment
he
advised
a
brown
ale
and
i
tried
this
one
it
was
very
smooth
but
did
not
have
a
terribly
strong
taste
very
drinkable
but
not
a
lot
of
punch
to
this
brown
ale
btwif
you
like
grotten
brown
try
old
dog
or
if
you
like
old
dog
give
grotten
brown
a
shot
the
drinkability
was
very
good
this
beer
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
it
had
a
nice
amber
color
when
pouring
into
a
pint
glass
but
little
head
it
had
a
nice
nutty
and
faint
chocolate
smell
it
had
decent
mouth
feel
but
the
after
taste
was
not
great
was
it
worth
the
8
50
for
the
six
pack
not
really
but
it
was
worth
a
try
this
is
an
extremely
flavorful
and
wellbalanced
brown
ale
the
sweet
nutty
flavor
is
complimented
by
a
subdued
hop
profile
and
a
nice
dry
dark
chocolate
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
creamy
not
too
carbonated
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
at
that
perfect
beer
to
kick
back
and
relax
with
smuttynose
old
brown
dog
is
an
easy
to
drink
mellow
brown
ale
with
a
lime
citrus
hop
thats
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
many
have
found
a
fondness
for
it
after
the
very
first
bottle
they
try
a
mellow
chocolate
malt
and
a
fig
fruitiness
round
out
the
flavor
and
aroma
profile
the
carbonation
has
a
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
and
is
great
right
out
of
the
bottle
pairs
excellently
with
anything
roasted
as
the
caramelized
flavors
match
while
the
carbonation
and
lime
citrus
clear
the
palate
for
the
next
bite
a
dessert
match
would
be
chocolate
pecan
pie
also
a
great
beer
to
session
with
and
stick
to
for
the
length
of
any
party
bbq
boat
trip
camping
trip
etc
etc
etc
very
consistent
whether
sampled
ontap
bottled
or
growler
a
nh
classic
pours
a
chestnut
brown
with
an
okay
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
the
smellis
malty
dry
and
maybe
just
a
little
nutty
the
same
dry
malt
is
present
in
the
taste
as
is
the
nuttiness
there
is
also
a
touch
of
caramel
and
raisins
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
taste
but
nicely
restrained
smooth
mouthfeel
dry
rather
than
creamy
nice
mellow
brown
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
pours
a
nice
looking
amberbrown
color
with
a
fat
twofinger
faintly
offwhite
head
that
forms
at
the
top
of
the
glass
and
lingers
for
a
while
gives
some
good
lace
as
well
as
it
recedes
the
aroma
is
a
classic
brown
ale
smell
nutty
with
some
smooth
malt
character
and
distant
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
this
aroma
is
subtle
but
really
nice
the
taste
follows
suit
serving
up
some
subtle
nut
and
coffee
flavors
with
a
slightly
fruity
cherries
and
raspberries
background
mouthfeel
is
layered
but
smooth
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
an
exceedingly
drinkable
beer
i
am
so
glad
that
there
are
some
fine
american
craft
breweries
out
there
doing
styles
like
this
very
well
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
and
both
fans
and
skeptics
of
the
style
should
give
this
one
a
try
this
would
go
great
in
a
rich
autumnal
beef
stew
and
would
make
an
excellent
beerburger
as
well
mouthfeel
drinkability
notes
smooth
and
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
moderately
carbonated
it¬ís
an
easy
drinker
and
a
solid
offering
by
smuttynose
if
i
was
a
bigger
fan
of
brown
ales
i¬íd
likely
have
this
on
hand
regularly
this
one
pours
a
very
nice
ruby
tinged
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
off
white
head
which
dissipates
slowly
and
leaves
some
lace
the
smell
is
rich
and
malty
with
a
touch
of
caramel
butterscotch
nuts
and
dates
the
taste
is
a
full
malt
profile
ranging
from
some
buttery
light
malts
to
caramels
to
a
touch
of
roasted
dark
malt
things
stay
sweet
but
are
balanced
by
a
sharp
bitter
finish
provided
by
the
hops
whose
flavor
is
very
subdued
a
fair
bit
of
alcohol
comes
through
as
well
the
mouthfeel
in
nice
great
full
body
with
a
pleasant
finish
that
is
not
too
dry
or
too
sweet
drinkability
is
good
maybe
not
my
favorite
english
brown
ale
but
still
a
top
notch
american
made
example
of
the
style
smells
of
all
those
delicious
brown
malt
flavors
candy
sugar
chestnut
cocoa
yum
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
a
tiny
bit
of
fruity
ester
and
bitter
hop
keeping
it
from
being
a
dubbel
a
little
too
boozy
for
the
abv
i
feel
that
with
all
of
that
malt
it
should
be
better
hidden
i
guess
thats
whats
keeping
me
from
saying
that
this
is
my
favorite
brown
ale
ever
oh
well
it
ranks
up
there
if
only
it
were
a
little
more
drinkable
pours
a
nice
slightly
cloudy
dark
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
tiny
fizzy
offwhite
head
some
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
toasty
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
a
nice
toasted
malty
flavor
with
a
good
dose
of
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
little
brown
ale
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
out
i
bought
a
sixpack
of
this
one
because
it
sells
very
well
in
my
store
i
work
at
a
local
grocer
it
pours
a
tad
darker
than
i
would
expect
from
a
brown
ale
though
my
only
real
basis
is
from
new
castle
like
other
brown
ales
it
has
a
slight
nuttiness
to
it
that
is
welcomed
by
the
taste
buds
of
the
multiple
beers
ive
tried
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
ive
had
except
for
maybe
boddingtons
pub
ale
which
if
im
not
mistaken
is
supposed
to
be
quaffable
for
anyone
looking
for
a
nice
ale
this
smuttynose
is
a
great
choice
ive
even
recommended
it
to
a
few
customers
d
nice
to
drink
a
likable
sipping
brown
ale
i
enjoyed
how
the
mouthfeel
developed
and
definitely
liked
the
lasting
toasty
bitterness
a
good
one
that
id
like
to
have
again
thanks
john
this
is
a
great
beer
to
session
dark
chesnut
brown
with
off
white
head
this
beer
did
not
have
much
of
a
nose
but
what
was
there
was
a
nice
smell
of
malt
the
taste
followed
up
the
nose
lots
of
malts
with
a
crisp
clean
dry
finish
spot
on
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
and
the
drinkablity
as
with
all
good
ales
in
this
style
is
exceptional
an
easy
drinker
that
i
will
have
again
nice
nice
nice
really
nice
example
of
a
good
brown
pours
a
sweet
amber
brown
with
an
off
white
head
good
lacing
smells
sweet
and
slightly
like
someone
previously
mentioned
dried
fruit
very
smooth
taste
slight
citrus
notes
really
well
balanced
everything
i
look
for
in
a
brown
and
from
new
hampshire
great
beer
i
could
drink
a
billion
of
these
possibly
in
one
sitting
i
like
this
offering
from
smut
its
refreshing
and
not
overly
sweet
the
hops
are
floraly
and
inviting
in
the
taste
one
good
brown
mediumbodied
and
sweet
very
well
balanced
a
solid
brown
12oz
bottle
pours
a
light
brown
almost
a
cloudy
dark
gold
when
held
up
to
light
no
carbonation
evident
medium
malty
aroma
the
flavour
profile
feels
pretty
typical
for
the
style
with
the
focus
on
middleoftheroad
malts
and
not
really
that
much
else
i
think
i
should
give
up
on
sampling
brown
ales
because
i
seem
to
feel
the
same
way
every
time
and
rarely
has
anything
stepped
up
to
be
distinctive
just
a
nice
beer
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
just
a
good
beer
its
very
well
balanced
and
was
damn
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
the
various
complimentary
relationships
weighs
and
measures
in
it
would
pair
well
with
a
simple
red
meat
any
bar
food
cheese
but
nothing
too
strong
ahh
a
cheeseburger
fries
would
be
killer
we
need
beers
like
this
to
just
have
and
to
drink
and
enjoy
and
enjoy
more
than
one
certainly
a
worthy
beer
of
anyone
who
enjoys
a
well
crafted
albeit
simple
brew
check
it
out
a
very
nice
high
quality
refreshing
english
brown
drinkability
from
the
aroma
to
the
taste
i
would
say
this
beer
is
drinkable
for
the
style
it
represents
pours
a
darkish
brown
amber
with
some
ruby
hues
when
held
to
the
light
minimal
head
but
whats
there
leaves
a
touch
of
beige
lacing
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
pleasant
malt
aroma
is
just
a
tad
sweet
smelling
with
a
bit
of
caramel
but
mostly
roasted
malts
and
a
nutty
scent
malts
take
the
stage
on
the
tongue
as
well
again
roasted
malts
and
some
nutty
flavor
with
a
nice
hop
balance
on
the
back
end
this
is
a
crisp
mediumbodied
and
tasty
brown
ale
that
makes
a
great
session
beer
drinkable
brew
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
smooth
extremely
drinkable
a
near
perfect
session
brew
dont
drink
and
review
purchased
recently
as
a
mix
pack
in
northport
pours
a
dark
clear
brown
with
a
moderate
heads
that
sticks
around
smells
a
bit
musty
and
malty
not
too
strong
tastes
nice
a
good
nutty
malt
caramel
flavor
with
a
hint
of
grass
liek
hops
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
fuzzy
but
overall
pretty
good
especially
for
a
brown
ale
usually
i
find
this
style
a
bit
lacking
but
this
one
is
really
good
for
a
smuttynose
this
one
is
not
up
to
par
the
smell
is
musty
a
little
tinny
it
did
remind
me
a
little
of
a
wet
dog
not
too
good
the
color
is
dark
rich
amber
clear
with
not
much
head
okay
on
the
carbonation
front
the
taste
hmmm
decent
mix
between
hops
and
malts
on
the
dry
side
a
medium
balance
and
texture
the
taste
has
some
fruity
complexity
there
are
difficult
to
discern
flavors
in
this
beer
maybe
a
little
on
the
coffeechocolate
side
of
the
taste
spectrum
but
i
remain
unimpressed
its
okay
but
not
worth
returning
to
and
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
coming
from
smuttynose
which
has
made
some
excellent
beers
in
the
past
this
beer
could
be
lucky
lady

smuttynose
has
positioned
itself
as
my
favorite
new
england
brewery
old
brown
dog
continues
to
solidify
that
reputation
in
my
mind
obd
is
a
wonderful
brown
ale
it
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
hint
of
red
similar
to
the
label
background
behind
the
dog
with
a
nice
modest
but
persistent
head
the
smell
is
malt
all
the
way
with
toasty
slightly
molasses
notes
the
taste
is
of
sweet
slightly
molasses
but
not
overly
so
taste
buds
respond
happily
to
each
sip
and
each
sip
leaves
me
thirsty
for
the
next
good
even
body
with
good
level
of
carbonation
allows
this
beer
to
coat
my
mouth
and
leave
a
hint
of
malty
sweetness
lingering
in
my
mouth
oelergud
drinkability
this
beer
confused
me
i
got
an
initial
taste
and
smell
of
something
nice
but
the
head
died
and
the
aroma
went
with
it
the
flavor
seems
dominated
by
the
dry
sensation
its
a
good
beer
one
ill
likely
try
again
just
to
compare
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
very
filling
good
representation
of
style
its
a
very
ordinary
beer
but
its
a
good
beer
to
pound
d
a
very
drinkable
brown
nice
malt
easy
to
quaff
recommended
pours
a
light
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
it
smelled
malty
it
tasted
malty
sweet
but
was
dry
in
the
finish
it
was
smooth
on
the
tongue
not
too
carbonated
this
would
be
a
decent
session
beer
not
as
good
though
as
some
other
smuttynose
beers
overall
impression
very
nice
very
drinkable
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
great
session
beer
da
delicious
example
of
what
brown
ale
was
intended
to
taste
like
this
beer
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
has
balance
and
subtlety
and
is
eminently
drinkable

an

sweet
jesus
is
this
awesome
hoppy
flowery
aroma
and
taste
with
a
sweet
chocolate
malt
flavor
that
kind
of
snuck
up
on
my
after
about
6
or
8
sips
this
was
almost
sensory
overload
as
it
was
great
to
smell
and
drink
it
i
could
drink
this
all
winter
right
in
front
of
a
fire
the
5
9
abv
helped
my
wife
seemed
to
like
it
too
unfortunately
this
is
a
new
hampshirebased
brewery
so
its
probably
only
available
in
the
northeast
i
found
this
in
an
lcbo
near
toronto
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
one
brown
ale
i
would
never
turn
down
pretty
sure
my
sniffer
is
working
fine
today
so
im
kind
of
amazed
by
the
lack
of
character
in
the
aroma
otherwise
this
is
real
solid
this
one
poured
a
dark
ruby
brown
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
mild
lace
clinging
down
the
pint
smells

and
very
enjoyable
smuttynose
always
delivers
good
quality
brews
and
this
one
meets
quality
in
my
book
i
hope
to
visit
the
brewery
this
summer
i
was
thinking
this
had
be
super
on
tap
before
i
visited
the
ba
and
the
alstrom
bros
review
gave
me
a
little
feedback
on
that
thought
d
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
craved
a
brown
ale
but
i
may
have
just
introduced
myself
to
one
that
i
could
crave
its
different
its
nicely
sweet
but
not
overpowering
its
hopped
but
more
for
aroma
than
gratuitous
bitterness
its
easy
to
drink
but
not
because
its
a
watereddown
beer
to
lead
your
beer
lineup
in
sales
i
can
and
will
have
another
poured
a
deep
dark
redbrown
decent
head
which
dissipated
quickly
minimal
lacing
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
with
noticeable
alcohol
taste
is
same
as
smell
with
a
decently
dry
finish
my
major
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
the
alcohol
was
clearly
present
throughoput
despite
a
relatively
low
this
is
my
first
smutty
nose
and
overall
im
not
impressed
i
will
try
their
other
beers
though
a
solid
beer
good
to
keep
in
the
fridge
as
an
everyday
drink
it
is
a
redbrown
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
a
sweet
caramel
aroma
taste
too
was
caramel
with
a
malty
base
very
enjoyable
and
dependable
good
offering
from
smutty
try
it
sometime
overall
a
tasty
beer
i
wouldnt
call
this
special
like
sns
porter
overall
not
a
bad
beer
not
one
i
would
seek
again
all
in
all
i
would
say
that
this
is
most
definitely
the
best
brown
ale
on
the
marker
too
bad
its
so
damned
hard
to
get
ahold
of
the
last
two
kegs
that
i
purchased
for
my
homebar
was
obd
ale
its
a
real
crowd
pleaser
brown
ale
is
typically
a
middle
of
the
road
style
that
satisfies
both
newbies
and
jadedbeergeeks
smuttynose
kicks
it
up
a
notch
with
extra
hoppiness
that
little
extra
bite
is
a
nice
touch
that
keeps
the
beer
from
tasting
bland
and
boring
after
a
few
pints
its
a
nice
looking
orangish
brown
color
with
great
head
retention
i
buy
the
16th
logs
and
they
go
fast
drinkabilityoverall
a
nice
little
english
brown
with
solid
style
characteristics
and
great
drinkability
potential
another
great
brew
from
a
great
brewery
if
you
havent
tried
it
yet
do
yourself
a
favor
and
find
some
i
had
this
on
draft
out
of
a
keg
at
my
girlfriends
family
thanksgiving
in
maine
good
stuff
better
out
of
the
keg
but
bottle
is
still
pretty
tasty
nice
going
john
buy
it
and
enjoy
a
nice
session
ale
for
a
holiday
party
d
this
beer
has
good
complexity
and
depth
with
a
nice
supporting
flavor
of
hops
this
beer
has
restored
my
faith
in
brown
ales
it
really
shows
how
a
great
drinkable
mild
ale
should
taste
murky
brownishred
body
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
smells
hoppy
with
some
malt
taste
is
equally
malty
sweet
and
hoppy
malt
may
even
overpower
the
hop
somewhat
but
is
generally
pretty
wellballanced
tasty
medium
bodied
tasty
solid
ale
im
impressed
and
would
definitely
get
this
one
again
pours
a
light
mahogony
color
with
a
slightly
off
white
large
head
the
head
fades
slowly
down
to
a
covering
of
the
glass
light
amount
of
lacing
this
beer
has
a
nice
nose
malty
and
a
touch
of
spiciness
the
taste
is
great
primarily
malty
with
a
nice
light
hops
finish
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
somewhat
sweeter
brooklyn
monster
ale
but
without
the
alcohol
blast
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
and
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
beer
i
would
look
forward
to
having
again
would
make
a
great
session
beer
for
a
group
that
thinks
beer
should
have
a
taste
quite
good
imo
smuttynose
is
capable
of
a
lot
more
than
this
thats
right
decent
beer
i
would
expect
more
from
one
of
the
premiere
breweries
on
the
east
coast
d
good
nutty
flavor
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
is
not
bad
would
try
this
again
this
beer
pours
a
nice
rich
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
and
very
little
lacing
it
has
very
little
smell
just
a
hit
of
a
sweet
malt
smell
it
has
a
chocolaty
malt
flavor
that
clears
away
way
too
fast
the
beer
has
a
smooth
crisp
texture
and
clears
away
fast
in
all
this
beer
is
way
too
week
in
flavor
and
a
little
to
thin
it
has
a
good
taste
but
there
just
isn¬ít
enough
of
it
it¬ís
a
great
beer
if
you
don¬ít
like
the
taste
of
beer
but
who
wants
that
musings
not
a
huge
fan
of
browns
but
this
one
is
pretty
tight
and
right
on
target
very
drinkable
classic
styled
brown
ale
as
such
also
very
sessionable
would
also
serve
as
a
great
introduction
to
brews
made
with
the
darker
roasted
malts
glad
to
have
tried
this
brew
and
will
likely
drink
this
one
again
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
typical
english
style
session
beer
good
for
long
autumn
nights
with
friends
you
know

with

notes
there
is
a

hazelnutchocolate
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
definitely
the
strongest
aspect
a
very
reserved
and
wellcrafted
nuttiness
melds
with
chocolatey
malts
and
a

the

the

just
about

ive
had
this
on
tap
before
and
its
a
little
more
flavorful
but
one
could
do

worse
than
grab
a
sixer
of
this

smuttynose
comes
through
with
a
solid
enjoyable
beer
that
seems
to
nail
the
style
its
aiming
for
its
got
the
earthy
nuttiness
youd
expect
and
while
the
aroma
is
a
bit
sparse
the
flavor
makes
up
for
that
its
very
drinkable
with
an
aftertaste
thats
a
joy
it
seems
these
folks
just
cant
manage
to
do
very
much
wrong
good
dog
notes
nothing
fancy
just
sturdy
and
tasty
like
a
good
brown
ale
should
be
overall
its
a
wellmade
wellbalanced
and
highly
drinkable
ale
which
of
course
is
what
a
brown
ale
should
be
nicely
done
a
nice
deep
brown
with
some
reddish
hints
and
a
pleasing
tan
head
but
only
after
vigorous
pouring
nose
has
that
brown
ale
sourness
but
complimented
by
some
nice
grapelike
malt
aromas
and
some
earthy
nutty
seedy
stuff
in
the
background
pretty
well
balanced
first
taste
almost
hard
to
get
a
read
as
all
of
the
above
mentioned
flavors
take
their
turns
vying
for
dominance
actually
makes
it
fairly
interesting
malts
became
more
pronounced
in
the
aftertaste
followed
by
the
hops
both
were
fairly
strong
in
their
own
right
a
nice
creamy
mouth
feel
as
well
definitely
not
a
killer
alcoholwise
and
i
feel
as
if
though
strong
in
taste
it
doesn¬ít
blow
your
taste
buds
i
could
have
more
all
in
all
definitely
more
hops
than
i
expected
bordering
on
weak
ipa
levels
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
the
hound
on
the
label
is
quite
handsome
as
well
pours
a
smooth
brown
ale
with
no
head
and
little
retention
scent
of
roasted
nuts
caramel
and
chocolate
through
out
feelin
ready
to
bite
down
on
a
nice
piece
of
bbq
chicken
with
this
oh
ya
this
is
it
the
roasted
caramel
flavours
compliment
the
bbq
flavour
of
the
chicken
a
true
brown
ale
with
the
perfect
amount
of
everything
from
abv
to
roasted
malts
next
to
brooklyn
this
is
my
fav
thank
you
mr
brown
dog
drinkability
is
good
but
could
be
better
the
sum
of
its
parts
are
better
then
the
whole
mk
medium
bodied
with
a
roasted
nut
flavor
accompanied
by
a
sweet
malty
presence
finishes
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
grassy
easy
to
drink
though
not
exceptional
worth
trying
though
not
a
go
to
beer
a
classy
classic
brown
ale
all
the
way
pours
an
amber
with
a
decent
two
finger
tinted
off
white
head
smells
like
and
english
brown
but
with
some
american
hops
leaning
toward
american
but
near
balanced
in
aroma
taste
is
multilayered
starts
like
a
hoppy
amber
ale
then
morphs
into
a
bit
of
nutty
brown
flavor
and
then
leaves
a
husky
ghost
note
of
dark
or
roasted
malt
as
it
fades
its
balanced
but
still
leans
toward
hops
and
the
type
of
hop
used
is
a
little
dominant
making
it
taste
like
a
strong
amber
over
the
browner
nuttier
subtleties
mouthfeel
is
on
par
and
medium
bodied
balanced
and
lively
invites
drinking
im
torn
if
this
is
too
hoppy
to
imagine
friends
drinking
it
or
not
its
a
good
drinker
id
just
rather
something
else
rich
brown
that
is
slightly
opaque
has
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
is
initially
about
a
¬î
but
almost
completely
disappears
by
the
end
smell
is
slightly
of
caramel
but
roasted
malts
seem
to
dominate
taste
is
mainly
of
sweet
malts
and
some
roasted
malts
it
is
fairly
simple
but
certainly
not
in
a
bad
way
some
carbonation
overall
very
smooth
and
lightbodied
this
is
not
a
complex
brew
by
any
means
but
that
characteristic
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
good
session
beer
especially
if
you¬íre
a
fan
of
the
style
d
lack
of
complexity
and
mouthfeel
along
with
a
taste
that
would
remain
non
offensive
through
a
six
pack
or
two
make
this
a
great
beer
to
drink
have
one
have
a
case
it
will
last
well
worth
the
try
if
you
like
the
style
drinkability
one
of
the
better
english
browns
ive
had
domestic
or
import
a
solid
brew
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
one
that
could
also
probably
be
paired
nicely
with
some
good
meal
combinations
but
still
its
very
good
on
its
own
a
pretty
great
brown
ale
very
tasty
and
satisfying
mouthfeel
is
slightly
slick
very
yummy
all
kinds
of
flavor
to
be
had
here
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
more
of
these
if
i
had
em
definite
session
material
here
great
after
a
long
days
work
taste
the
smell
color
and
pour
built
me
up
for
a
let
down
with
flavor
it
was
a
good
beer
that
did
not
live
up
to
the
tremendous
smell
i
could
taste
the
alcohol
it
seemed
raw
it
was
good
for
an
occasional
beer
but
would
get
old
with
more
than
two
a
crystal
clear
light
brown
with
slight
copper
color
moderate
head
with
lacing
until
the
end

was
very
mild

it
higher

i
try

i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
brown

a
wonderful

the
nose

you
take
your

provides
for

a
brown

should
be
not
sure
what
all
the
hype
is
about
as
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
average
poured
into
a
standard
pint
as
a
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
sizeable
tannish
head
and
decent
lacing
nose
is
quite
nutty
and
the
malt
foundation
is
predominant
leaving
a
rather
sweet
disposition
that
carries
over
into
the
taste

nutty
and
malty
sweetness
this
beer
is
light
medium
bodied
and
a
good
brown
ale
over
all
brown
ale
isnt
among
my
favorite
styles
but
this
one
is
really
very
drinkable
and
id
not
require
a
twisted
arm
to
drink
it
again
overall
a
good
beer
with
some
character
d
very
nice
for
a
darker
session
beer
that
nutty
aftertaste
is
inviting
me
for
another
sip
every
time
poured
a
crystal
clear
mahoganybrown
color
with
moderate
white
head
that
quickly
fell
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
extraordinary
with
strong
notes
of
roasted
malt
combined
with
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
is
somewhat
on
the
sweet
side
and
a
nice
maltiness
balanced
with
a
good
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
great
combination
finished
slightly
dry
but
with
a
taste
that
rapidly
dissapates
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
a
rich
dark
amber
brown
color
starts
this
classic
brew
off
and
notes
of
caramel
coffee
and
toasted
nuts
showcase
its
aromatics
this
beer
has
some
toffee
characteristics
to
it
as
well
along
with
a
slightly
smoky
and
very
very
long
finish
tried
it
on
tap
for
the
first
time
recently
always
purchased
it
in
bottles
before
much
betterdifferent
on
tap
old
brown
dogs
theyre
plain
ciderfaerie
and
thats
kinda
what
i
thought
of
this
brew
fairly
plain
but
nice
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
effervescent
as
one
would
expec
this
is
a
drinkable
brown
that
might
make
a
decent
session
brew
especially
in
the
spring
months
this
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
and
leaves
a
thin
lace
that
quickly
disappates
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
wonderful
of
cocoa
powder
molasses
lemon
and
some
earth
tones
as
i
taste
this
beer
all
the
previous
flavors
come
out
i
can
really
taste
the
chocolate
on
the
fore
front
as
well
as
some
hop
kick
rounded
out
with
some
sweetness
from
the
molasses
then
finished
with
a
orange
rind
bitterness
this
is
a
good
beer
from
smuttynose
one
i
will
def
come
back
to
poured
from
bottle
with
june
drink
by
date
the
color
is
a
reddish
brown
with
nice
clarity
topped
off
by
a
tan
1
inch
head
the
lacing
is
thick
and
nice
at
first
as
the
head
sticks
around
i
found
the
aroma
to
be
hoppy
with
hints
of
caramel
and
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
hoppy
for
a
brown
ale
with
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
different
than
other
browns
i
have
tried
the
taste
is
pretty
bold
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
it
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
looking
like
some
ice
tea
with
a
little
too
much
mix
the
one
inch
head
quickly
fades
away
leaving
next
to
nothing
with
no
lacing
on
the
glass
when
i
sip
it
a
slight
bitterness
is
the
first
thing
to
hit
me
followed
by
some
nuts
and
some
slight
malts
a
very
nice
medium
bodied
mouth
feel
with
good
drinkability
drinkability
a
very
easy
drinker
that
wont
offend
too
many
palates
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
would
make
a
great
session
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
night
another
fine
beer
from
smuttynose
worth
seeking
out
d
i
only
bought
one
bottle
of
this
and
i
definately
need
to
have
another
to
be
100
sure
on
how
much
i
could
drink
this
if
you
really
dig
this
it
would
be
a
great
session
beer
however
im
not
thrilled
with
it
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
head
that
doesnt
stay
for
that
long
smells
of
roasty
malts
with
a
mild
hop
sprinkle
tastes
deliciously
robust
with
a
coffeelike
malt
profile
a
little
thin
in
the
end
though
smooth
mouthfeel
some
carbonation
a
good
beer
to
relax
with
i
could
drink
these
all
night
not
sure
if
it
is
becuase
of
the
excellent
mouthfeel
or
what
but
this
is
deffinately
a
beer
that
is
brewed
with
high
quality
and
care
wouldnt
know
it
was
5
7
if
i
had
to
guess
the
abv
puts
it
at
the
upper
limits
of
a
session
beer
but
it
would
do
fine
if
you
don¬ít
mind
a
little
extra
booze
a
solid
brown
ale
this
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
fine
two
finger
head
a
nice
look
fellowed
by
a
nice
earthy
smell
not
too
hoppy
for
an
alebut
with
just
enough
spices
this
has
a
nice
flavorbut
for
this
genre
its
a
little
lighter
than
others
the
mouthfeel
is
lightalmost
watery
aftertastebut
still
not
bad
this
isnt
the
best
english
brown
ale
ive
ever
hadbut
its
not
the
worst
either
i
would
have
another
one
a
bit
too
carbonated
in
my
opinion
but
overall
tasty
and
drinkable
wish
i
had
more
of
thisit
could
be
a
great
food
beer
dark
brown
in
color
suprisingly
creamy
offwhite
head
with
loosly
sticky
lacing
light
odor
clean
toasty
lighly
nutty
taste
is
sweet
malty
upfront
with
a
minimal
hoppy
finish
heavier
than
expected
with
noticable
carbonation
certainly
a
solid
english
brown
ale
and
another
good
beer
from
smuttynose
worth
a
try
drinkability
i
find
this
beer
pretty
mediocre
for
smuttynose
it
was
the
only
one
from
the
variety
pack
that
didnt
impress
me
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
though
it
goes
down
easily
weak
flavor
enables
you
to
keep
drinking
it
would
go
well
with
lots
of
foods
poultry
dishes
come
to
mind
especially
since
food
would
cleanse
the
film
off
your
mouth
with
this
unpleasant
mouthfeel
i
dont
really
want
another
i
suppose
it
is
a
decent
brown
a
little
bitter
with
a
foul
mouthfeel
but
decent
it
just
doesnt
impress
me
in
anyway
what
a
solid
brown
ale
this
offering
from
smuttynose
usually
slips
under
my
radar
i
have
to
make
an
effort
to
buy
this
beer
more
often
its
probably
versatile
in
terms
of
pairing
it
up
with
different
foods
as
well
hands
down
one
of
the
smoothest
5
7
abv
beers
i
have
ever
had
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
but
as
an
english
style
brown
ale
its
might
be
out
of
style
at
5
7
abv
this
would
be
fun
to
drink
for
a
few
hours
overall
a
well
represented
brown
ale
not
my
favorite
style
due
to
the
low
hops
but
its
still
a
very
respectable
brew
and
i
definitely
recommend
it
to
fans
of
the
taste
thanks
to
realitydeviant
for
sending
me
a
few
bottles
of
this
this
was
a
good
brew
indeed
overallthe
best
brown
ale
ive
had
to
date
wonderful
malt
flavors
decent
alcohol
content
and
a
smoothness
to
it
that
adds
greater
enjoyment
pick
this
one
up
now
if
your
at
all
a
fan
of
brown
ales
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
small
head
lively
carbonation
and
a
little
bit
light
in
body
for
a
brown
ale
the
aroma
was
dull
and
i
couldnt
really
pick
much
up
from
it
the
taste
had
a
slight
nuttiness
to
it
with
some
caramel
mixed
in
very
smooth
beer
nothing
really
excited
me
too
much
about
this
beer
but
it
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
very
drinkable
and
not
too
sweet
a
good
kix
breakfast
kids
love
to
eat
ths
brew
pours
a
light
hazy
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
to
ring
the
beer
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
darker
color
the
nose
is
slight
nutty
and
roasty
tones
slight
caramel
and
slight
brownsugar
sweetness
the
flavor
is
nice
starts
as
a
nutty
and
roasty
and
moves
more
towards
a
burnt
caramel
roastyness
almost
slightly
coffee
but
not
i
think
that
the
flavor
is
very
good
fairly
well
right
where
i
want
to
see
a
brown
ale
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
very
solid
beer
goes
down
easy
very
quenching
easy
drinking
good
show
poured
a
cloudy
orange
brown
in
color
minimal
head
and
no
lacing
very
little
carbonation
the
beer
seams
to
have
no
life
slight
nutty
smell
and
taste
very
minimal
bitterness
very
smooth
finish
and
taste
i
kind
of
conflicted
on
this
beer
it
taste
much
better
than
it
looks
pours
brown
as
describedhint
of
ruby
at
the
bottom
part
of
glass
no
head
to
speak
of
and
a
moderate
amount
of
thin
lace
just
a
nice
hearty
malt
and
hops
balance
on
the
nose
cedar
elements
too
some
slight
sourness
but
nothing
to
detract
from
the
enjoyment
tastes
a
little
similar
to
the
robust
porter
in
the
background
but
i
love
the
robust
porter
so
thats
a
good
thing
all
the
nose
elements
are
equally
apparent
on
the
palate
as
they
are
scentwise
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
cleana
touch
dry
but
very
pleasant
drinkableoh
yes
these
are
too
drinkable
at
5
7
actually
thats
not
too
bad
for
a
very
nice
brown
ale
very
nice
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
poured
with
a
nice
head
that
faded
fairly
quickly
but
left
a
nice
lace
in
the
glass
cant
get
too
much
smell
but
it
may
be
a
little
cold
so
ill
need
to
wait
for
it
to
warm
a
little
hint
of
roasted
malts
in
the
nose
really
nice
example
of
a
brown
ale
dark
amber
in
color
the
roasted
malts
come
in
the
beginning
of
the
sip
and
the
hops
carry
the
beer
through
nicely
to
the
finish
not
overwhelming
in
the
hops
department
just
enough
to
balance
the
beer
this
balance
coupled
with
the
creamy
mouthfeel
make
for
excellent
drinkability
an
english
brown
i
would
recommend
and
will
remember
the
next
time
i
am
in
the
mood
for
one
a
fine
example
of
the
style
i
could
drink
these
all
night
nice
job
smuttynose
another
excellent
choice
from
jah
noth
had
4
5
years
later
on
tap
at
the
smuttynose
brewpub
and
not
so
much
roast
came
through
above
average
mouthfeel
lacey
and
fresh
beer
looked
like
the
color
of
an
acorn
with
very
little
to
no
head
decent
lacing
and
good
carbonation
smelled
like
roasted
grain
and
a
slight
hops
aroma
the
taste
was
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
at
end
and
hoppy
aftertaste
it
got
better
the
more
i
drank
great
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
i
believe
this
beer
would
continue
to
go
down
smooth
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
session
ale
and
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
appreciates
a
good
brown
old
brown
dog
marks
its
territory
as
a
more
hoppy
less
roasty
brown
ale
and
guards
it
with
a
menacing
growl
i
havent
run
across
a
beer
of
this
style
that
presents
itself
in
quite
the
same
way
so
points
for
originality
must
be
accorded
as
well
as
points
for
quality
if
you
love
hoppy
browns
unleash
this
pooch
and
let
him
run
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
found
this
on
tap
at
austins
ale
house
in
queens
dark
brown
body
with
a
thick
smooth
tan
head
smell
is
toasted
malt
with
very
light
coffee
notes
taste
is
sweet
malt
grainy
flavor
very
very
light
coffee
flavor
i
dont
like
too
much
coffee
taste
in
my
brown
ales
this
ale
was
perfect
in
that
respect
some
fruit
flavor
in
the
end
maybe
light
carbonation
and
so
smooth
drinkability
is
almost
an
amazing
5
this
brew
went
down
so
easy
and
i
wanted
another
bad
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
not
sure
why
it
hasnt
gotten
higher
marks
here
on
ba
nice
russet
brown
appearance
with
amber
streaking
good
sized
tan
head
airy
creamy
nice
whiffs
of
toffee
chocolate
and
butter
brickle
theres
nice
mild
toffee
like
malt
presence
and
some
dry
cocoa
to
accent
it
just
the
slightest
bit
of
a
sourness
and
some
earthy
hop
accents
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
lightmedium
bodied
decent
little
session
brew
here
very
easy
to
drink
and
one
i
will
look
for
again
i
thought
this
reminded
of
leffes
brown
a
bit
although
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
one
pours
reddish
brown
there
is
little
head
despite
my
beset
pouring
efforts
the
aroma
is
caramel
and
toffee
tastes
slightly
nutty
with
a
caramel
flavor
and
a
hint
of
coffee
sweeter
than
i
expected
in
a
good
way
finishes
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
medium
body
highly
drinkable
an
allaround
good
brown
ale
dark
mahogany
color
with
excellent
clarity
light
head
and
light
lacing
malty
aroma
figs
caramel
and
roasted
grains
dominate
similar
flavor
profile
slightly
sourastringent
nutty
malts
with
a
crisp
lightly
hoppy
finish
big
bubbles
of
carbonation
lend
a
weird
mouthfeel
i
think
this
bottle
is
old
cuz
this
beer
has
definately
tasted
better
overall
drinkable
yet
laeves
something
to
be
desired
this
poured
out
with
about
a
quarter
inch
tan
head
over
a
caramel
colored
body
the
head
falls
quick
leaving
just
a
light
coating
of
bubbles
and
no
lace
to
be
found
aroma
was
filled
with
sweet
caramel
malt
with
undertones
of
a
roasted
maltiness
the
taste
follows
suite
with
sweet
caramel
being
dominant
and
a
light
nuttiness
added
to
the
mix
the
flavor
ends
on
a
slightly
bitter
note
body
is
medium
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
to
it
this
is
definitely
a
beer
one
could
put
away
a
few
of
easily
its
easy
drinking
and
fairly
tasty
and
not
too
powerful
this
definitely
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
old
brown
dog
pours
a
a
deep

with
a

the
aroma
has
notes
of

caramel
some
spicy

and
some
sweet

taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
some

more

a
slight

tinge
and
a
dry
finish
lightly

medium

very
british
in
this
sense
very
drinkable
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
session
beers
the
hops
are
subdued
to
the
malt
but
provided
good
balance
this
beer
is
tasty
and
id
like
to
drink
a
few
more
beer
is
good
happy
beering
drinkability
i
really
like
this
ale
even
though
it
bursts
past
the
stylistic
restraints
that
most
brown
ales
stay
within
good
gets
this
brewery
has
an
impressive
record
this
brown
ale
doesnt
appear
to
be
so
brown
its
definately
a
little
light
for
the
style
but
hey
thats
ok
im
all
for
innovation
nice
head
smells
nutty
and
roasty
taste
is
great
nice
and
complex
for
a
brown
ale
there
is
this
taste
in
several
of
the
smuttynose
beers
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
if
you
have
any
insight
beermail
me
but
my
best
explanation
is
a
nonhop
piney
woodsyness
with
some
raisons
or
something
very
interesting
and
also
seems
to
be
only
in
smuttynose
beers
perhaps
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
for
a
brown
ale
but
very
easy
to
drink
not
your
standard
brown
ale
and
thats
a
good
thing
very
drinkable
smooth
strong
ale
nice
mahogany
rubyamber
color
clear
with
not
too
much
of
the
frothy
khaki
head
it
cleared
pretty
quick
and
left
only
a
thin
ring
great
scents
of
warm
butterscotch
toffee
and
caramel
malts
alot
of
carb
going
on
a
bit
much
for
me
it
foams
up
in
the
mouth
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
tastes
of
black
licorish
more
like
the
black
goodnplenty
candies
roasted
malty
flavors
good
flavor
with
a
nice
and
dry
finish
and
dry
mouthfeel
it
leaves
just
enough
flavor
on
your
tongue
and
just
a
bit
of
the
anise
flavor
easy
drinker
smooth
and
medium
bodied
just
goes
down
very
nice
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
brew
i
found
this
to
be
a
rather
uninspired
beer
right
from
the
start
for
starters
its
amber
in
color
defintely
not
brown
and
the
head
is
thin
and
spotty
at
best
the
aroma
was
slightly
roasty
but
mostly
malty
sweet
and
a
bit
sickly
at
that
the
taste
is
inoffensive
but
unexciting
as
well
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
roastiness
and
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
but
without
any
real
depth
or
character
thinnish
in
the
mouth
and
sweet
in
the
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
would
go
back
to
by
any
means
pint
at
cah
innsbrook
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
a
session
beer
imo
nothing
great
but
nothing
average
about
this
one
either
this
is
really
a
fantastic
session
beer
simple
malty
smooth
and
very
balanced
i
think
i¬íll
have
another
one
this
brown
ale
pours
a
rather
nice
dark
amber
color
there
is
a
moderate
foamy
head
which
lasts
for
a
bit
the
smell
is
rather
nondescript
the
taste
starts
out
pleasant
enough
a
fine
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
hops
but
there
is
a
disgusting
metallic
residue
on
the
tongue
i
can
not
recommend
this
ale
with
so
many
others
out
there
to
be
enjoyed
im
just
not
a
fan
of
american
brown
ales
i
find
them
boring
and
without
many
redeeming
qualities
this
one
like
most
others
is
very
similar
to
the
modern
petes
wicked
ale
and
theres
just
not
much
going
on
here
i
think
it
could
be
a
decent
session
beer
especially
if
the
alternatives
were
macros
this
brown
ale
poirs
a
deep
but
dull
beer
bottle
brown
how
appropriate
and
there
is
very
little
by
way
of
appreciable
head
the
aroma
is
of
nutty
almond
malts
with
slight
tartness
lurking
somewhere
in
the
background
the
taste
is
pretty
much
in
concord
with
the
way
this
ale
smells
the
tartness
is
a
touch
more
evident
but
the
brew
is
dominated
by
the
smoky
malts
the
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
supported
by
light
carbonation
and
the
finish
is
almost
sweet
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
disappearted
deep
amber
red
in
color
smells
great
taste
was
a
little
too
light
for
me
as
a
standalone
beer
however
i
really
started
enjoying
it
after
i
paired
it
with
my
black
angus
steak
off
the
grill
its
a
nice
beer
to
have
throughout
the
meal
a
good
representation
of
a
brown
ale
good
to
have
on
hand
but
just
not
my
perfect
beer
poured
into
an
imperial

is
a
reddish
amber
hue
and
has
a
heavy
malty
aroma
with
undertones
of
hops
maybe
a
bit
of
smoke
and
that
slight
underlying
alcohol
essence
taste
is
well
balanced
with
malt
and
hops
but
the
malt
is
victorious
with
more
pronounced
flavors
like
the
slight
coffee
and
smoke
mouthfeel
excellent
drinkability
not
a
problem
keeps
you
wanting

the

a
very
nice

overall
this
is
a
case
where
a
brew
looks
as
good
as
it
tastes
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
creamy
tannish
head
that
lingers
aroma
of
rich
malt
and
grains
almost
reminds
me
of
walking
through
the
grainery
in
my
old
home
town
this
is
all
about
the
best
use
of
grain
to
produce
a
great
tasting
smooth
drinking
brown
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
unfortunately
i
just
drank
the
last
bottle
and
the
stores
are
close
theres
always
tommorrow
surpassed
some
of
my
old
favorites
in
choice
worth
a
try
by
all
means
an
interesting
beer
to
drink
very
enjoyable
reminds
me
of
dead
guy
ale
by
rogue
worth
a
try
pours
a
medium
brown
with
amber
highlights
thru
out
not
much
head
but
that
wasnt
expected
or
hoped
for
aroma
was
chocolat
and
more
chocolate
with
an
underlying
nuttiness
to
itvery
appetizing
taste
is
to
me
of
malted
chocolate
balls
with
a
fruitiness
in
the
finish
a
true
to
form
brown
ale
appetizing
and
very
easy
to
drinkwell
done
this
beer
was
tough
to
pour
without
creating
a
lot
of
head
the
color
is
that
of
stained
wood
and
there
is
a
little
lace
around
the
glass
the
beer
tastes
like
the
smell
of
woodstain
unfortunately
its
not
bad
but
comes
off
as
tasting
a
bit
acidic
the
beer
was
bottled
recently
but
i
think
it
may
be
better
to
either
drink
off
the
tap
or
let
it
age
a
while
it
still
tastes
kind
of
green
to
me
a
thin
tan
head
graces
this
cola
colored
ale
perhaps
a
bit
more
amber
tinted
than
a
true
cola
a
malty
bread
biscuit
aroma
reminded
me
of
buttered
toast
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
chewy
thick
but
not
heavy
it
felt
good
on
the
palate
with
just
a
tingle
of
carbonation
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
and
very
clean
somewhat
meaty
with
a
toasted
flavor
and
peppery
aftertaste
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
smutty
offering
pours
a
clear
brown
color
with
an
1
inch
head
the
head
did
not
last
to
long
and
no
lacing
developed
the
aroma
was
mild
as
some
malt
and
caramel
tones
were
evident
the
flavor
was
nice
as
malt
caramel
and
a
tiny
hint
of
chocolate
were
touched
with
some
light
roastiness
very
little
bitterness
carbonation
level
was
somewhat
weak
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
this
was
on
the
lighter
side
of
a
medium
bodied
brew
nicely
drinkable
as
the
flavors
keep
this
interesting
overall
i
must
say
that
i
like
the
brew
very
sweet
and
that
is
what
would
be
its
downfall
for
a
brew
that
i
could
have
a
lot
of
in
one
setting
it
is
a
very
nice
offering
from
smuttynose

one
of
the
better
brown
ales
in
my
opinion
beats
brooklyn
brown
the
taste
is
unsweetened
cocoa
followed
by
a
balancing
hop
bite
this
bite
lasts
through
the
swallow

to
high
carbonation
the

012904
pours
out
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
malty
and
very
sweet
the
taste
is
actually
more
complex
than
i
expected
hints
of
malt
chocolate
raisins
and
also
a
touch
of
coffee
the
ending
seems
to
add
a
bit
of
hops
but
not
much
i
love
this
beer
on
tap
the
bottle
seems
to
have
something
a
bit
more
tart
to
it
not
sure
where
that
is
coming
from
a
solid
offering
from
smuttynose
tastes
quite
nutty
and
buttery
with
some
hints
of
a
slighlty
darker
malt
in
the
middle
the
problem
is
it
finishes
very
soapy
i
cant
explain
but
is
has
a
bit
of
detergent
mouthfeel
to
it
body
is
good
and
its
drinkable
but
the
ending
is
rather
unfinished
and
bizzare
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
like
a
great
little
ale
which
my
wife
absolutely
adores
recommended
poured
a
nutty
brown
without
much
head
and
a
lace
that
didnt
stick
the
deep
chocolate
and
nutty
roasted
aromas
carried
through
in
the
sweet
malt
which
managed
to
not
be
cloying
the
roasted
flavors
stuck
through
in
the
finish
this
seems
like
a
nice
fireplace
session
beer
taste
the
taste
was
very
malty
with
a
sweet
chocolate
overtone
the
carbonation
was
very
nice
adding
some
crispness
to
the
drink
there
was
a
little
hops
in
the
tail
end
adding
a
bitter
sharp
bite
but
this
mellowed
out
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
mellow
but
not
flat
or
boring
this
was
a
little
heavy
for
my
taste
and
the
alcohol
seemed
a
little
too
prevalent
for
knocking
back
more
than
a
few
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
what
smuttynose
has
to
offer
but
this
one
was
way
below
par
the
appearance
was
very
good
a
very
brown
color
with
a
good
head
and
very
pretty
lace
the
smell
was
of
a
cold
medicine
to
me
i
also
had
the
same
feeling
when
i
tasted
it
i
didnt
have
a
cold
but
when
i
do
this
is
what
ill
drink
im
sorry
but
this
was
bellow
par
for
te
great
smuttynose
brewery
bought
a
six
pack
for
6
99
wanted
to
try
out
more
smuttynose
i
enjoyed
their
porter
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
poured
a
dark
cloudy
brown
with
a
tan
head
nothing
too
unusal
from
other
brown
ales
smelled
a
little
nutty
first
sip
i
was
pleased
much
what
i
expected
hoppier
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
no
complaints
there
i
love
hops
all
in
all
money
well
spent
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
too
often
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
all
the
time
i
bought
a
6pack
of
old
brown
dog
ale
and
ill
drink
them
all
but
the
taste
isnt
very
pleasant
so
itll
take
me
a
week
or
2
to
finish
man
what
a
bummer
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
and
im
really
trying
but
the
stale
chocolate
taste
isnt
enjoyable
hopefully
weizenheimer
is
better
nice
auburn
color
with
yeast
haze
good
carbonation
and
acceptable
retention
smells
of
nutty
toasted
malt
toffee
and
a
good
dose
of
american
hops
as
it
warms
the
esters
and
fruitiness
of
the
hops
emerge
taste
leans
towards
the
sweet
side
but
is
pretty
balanced
good
caramel
toffee
and
slight
chocolate
flavors

a

the
nuttiness

sweetness
of
the

almost
overpowering

very

a

very

no

not
bad
would
get
again
not
a
style
i
normally
choose
so
thanks
for
the
nice
surprise
pat
olive
the
dog
has
a
subtle
scent
but
that
took
me
a
few
trys
to
even
notice
at
first
taste
its
almost
creamy
with
a
smoky
aftertaste
with
a
smooth
hop
finish
although
i
usually
go
for
the
bitters
this
is
a
fine
drink
and
i
will
certainly
be
trying
their
other
brews
definately
good
with
dinner
not
too
overbearing
on
the
ole
tongue
definately
a
good
starter
for
converts
a
unique
brown
rich
malt
character
with
chocolate
coffee
flavours
give
way
to
sublte
bitterness
and
an
orangey
hop
finish
damn
good
brown
ale
if
you
like
malty
brews
this
is
a
good
one
to
seek
out
nice
a
very
good
brown
ale
pours
out
to
a
very
dark
amber
almost
ruby
color
in
the
glass
the
aroma
is
somewhat
sweet
smelling
taste
is
extremely
malty
yet
balanced
the
malt
shines
and
really
gives
this
brown
some
teeth
but
is
finished
by
a
nice
slight
hop
bite
at
the
end
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
brown
ales
are
underrated
drinkability
could
have
a
few
lots
of
roast
and
chocolate
in
this
fairly
hearty
brown
ale
i
always
head
for
this
one
as
soon
as
the
weather
starts
to
turn
cool
the
flavor
is
nice
and
smooth
and
a
wonderful
compliment
to
stews
and
cassaroles
hey
i
review
wine
as
well
so
im
trained
to
foodpair
the
malt
is
noticable
but
not
overdone
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
but
its
flavor
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
very
dark
brown
cola
color
an
effervescent
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
hoppy
aroma
with
some
caramel
malts
coming
through
as
well
the
caramel
malt
flavors
dominate
but
without
the
caramel
flavor
some
hops
wave
hello
pretty
decent

from
smuttynose
cool
seal
logo
and
a
nice
brown
dog
named
olive
on
the
bottle
smooth
with
a
pretty
rich
medium
body
there
is
a
lot
of
sweetness
to
this
beer
but
definitely
not
to
the
point
of
cloying
it
is
balanced
well
with
some
darker
malts
and
flavors
of
chocolate
and
caramel
it
is
very
drinkable
and
it
was
great
with
some
wings
and
pulled
pork
this
dog
is
a
malt
lovers
delight
its
body
is
almost
brown
more
rubyamber
than
brown
i
could
get
nothing
resembling
a
head
atop
this
glass
despite
an
aggressive
pour
the
smell
is
very
malty
and
sweet
and
the
same
flavor
follows
has
a
huge
malt
profile
hazlenuts
caramel
and
toffee
are
all
thrown
in
the
mix
making
this
a
sweet
and
complex
brew
maybe
a
bit
more
balance
in
the
hops
to
balance
out
the
maltiness
all
in
all
one
of
the
nicer
browns
i
have
had
very
drinkable
would
do
well
after
dinner
as
it
is
rather
a
sweet

i
am
enjoying
it

its
own
however

is
slick

decent
beer
but
not

wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
more
malt
then
anything
else
some
hoppy

at
the
end

nothing

carbonation
taste
starts
malty
and
moves
to
a

sweet
caramel
with
very
subtle
hops
finishes
sweet
and
slightly
buttery
not
a
bad
brown
ale
not
to
complex
pretty
drinkable
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
provides
good
lacing
the
smell
is
of
rich
chocolate
crystal
and
roasted
malts
a
true
brown
ale
the
taste
is
smooth
and
balanced
the
complexity
of
this
brew
is
what
i
like
the
most
about
it
it
signifies
what
a
brown
ale
should
be
amberbrown
in
color
good
malty
aroma
a
complex
balance
of
specialty
malts
and
a
smooth
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
low
to
medium
which
makes
this
a
nice
sessions

ill
definitely
enjoy
the
rest
of
these
overall
good
but
not
spectacular
taste
is
a
bit
muted
but
i
could
drink
plenty
of
them
karl
f
i
found
it
to
be
similar
to
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
but
not
as
complex
other
reviewers
have
noted
more
malty
sweetness
but
i
didnt
notice
any
assuming
the
beer
didnt
get
skunked
perhaps
it
will
mellow
out
in
the
cellar
if
the
brewing
date
was
indeed
march
2003
it
may
need
to
sit
awhile
good

hop

with
hints
of
toasted

and

abv
is
easily
hidden
and
kind
of
high
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
one
could
underestimate
one
of
the
nicer
brown
ales
out
there
i
was
pleased
to
note
the
lack
of
a
sour
aftertaste
which
i
sometimes
notice
with
other
brown
ales
this
ale
poured
a
reddish
amber
brown
with
very
very
thin
white
foam
and
almost
no
carbonation
evident
there
smell
was
modest
sweet
malt
the
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
bisuit
and
nutty
flavors
there
was
low
but
noticeable
hop
character
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
very
low
carbonation
but
with
a
fairly
thin
body
the
drinkability
was
good
but
the
body
was
on
the
thin
side
for
this
brown
ale
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
due
to
its
drinkability
its
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
i
was
a
little
disappointed
to
see
the
head
disappear
so
quickly
after
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
glass
even
the
lace
slides
back
down
into
the
beer
in
short
order
the
malty
and
nutty
aroma
is
pleasant
and
not
overpowering
the
mouth
feel
seems
a
bit
thin
however
this
allows
each
sip
to
go
down
easy
the
taste
begins
malty
and
is
followed
by
flavors
of
caramel
and
nuts
i
find
a
very
slight
bitter
flavor
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
the
beer
spills
from
the
bottle
a
somewhat
hazy
mahogany
color
with
the
head
mountainous
and
the
consistency
that
of
whipped
cream
the
color
a
nice
light
tan
and
the
lace
a
smothering
sheet
nutty
sweet
a
touch
of
yeast
and
the
hop
flowers
present
clean
fresh
and
quite
sniffable
sweet
malt
at
the
start
top
middling
in
its
mouth
feel
the
carbonation
mild
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
the
aftertaste
droughty
and
long
lasting
and
a
nice
quaffable
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
light
creamy
tan
head
that
does
not
stick
around
a
fine
bubble
lace
is
left
behind
after
the
first
sip
a
copper
nose
and
taste
hits
the
palate
on
the
first
to
the
last
sip
chocolate
and
carmel
malt
hints
are
present
along
with
earthy
flavors
this
is
a
nice
brew
but
the
best
brown
ale
that
i
have
had
pours
a
truly
beautiful
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
transient
head
that
just
coats
the
top
of
the
glass
malty
sweet
caramel
aromas
filter
into
the
nasal
passages
flavor
continues
the
malty
procession
with
a
toasted
malt
flavor
dominating
mouthfeel
is
defninitely
creamy
that
floats
over
the
palate
finishes
with
just
a
trace
of
hoppiness
to
balance
nicely
interesting
although
a
brown
ale
this
definitely
pushes
towards
the
range
of
winter
warmersstrong
ales
dark
brown
with
reds
blending
in
a
slight
head
malty
with
a
strong
caramel
malt
flavour
that
is
lightly
balanced
by
a
few
hops
a
little
alcohol
kick
and
warmth
is
inherent
i
liked
it
found
at
jungle
jims
in
fairlfield
pours
a
dark
amber
with
very
little
head
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
a
little
fruit
flavor
consists
of
malt
nuts
and
caramel
and
tasted
better
as
i
let
it
warm
overall
not
fantastic

i
admittedly
dont
drink
enough
of
smuttynoses
beers
considering
their
easy
availability
here
in
boston
they
dont
disappoint
this
is
a
wonderfull
brown
that
is
quite
drinkable
if
you
want
a
fine
example
of
an
american
style
brown
look
no
further
however
i
am
unsure
as
to
its
drinkability
in
session
btw
they
added
0
2
more
just
for
that
extra
pleasure
the
dog
on
the
label
alone
made
me
buy
this
beer
very
dark
beer
mahobany
beer
with
a
deep
robust
taste
not
as
deep
as
the
robust
porter
the
carbonation
is
light
adding
to
the
drinkability
the
nutty
taste
and
the
hops
can
be
tasted
on
even
the
smallest
sip

usually
like

this

medium

in

i
cant

to
get
my

on
more
of
these
right
up

of

the
ones
i

recent

vacation
doublebock

up
for
this
one
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
an
orange
tint
with
a
thin
tan
lace
on
the
nose
the
aromas
of
malt
caramel
and
fruity
undertones
are
evident
on
the
palate
there
is
a
caramel
malt
sweetness
dark
fruity
notes
toffee
perhaps
slight
graininess
and
a
touch
of
brown

bready
the
mouthfeel

emmm
i
love
this
old
brown
dog
good
brew
all
in
all
pretty
good
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
was
probably
inevitably
a
tad
let
down
very
sweet
malts
caramel
brown
sugar
maple
syrup
hints
it
not
only
looks
brown
but
tastes
brown
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
perhaps
the
grassy
hints
could
be
embellished
into
a
stronger
flavor
to
balance
the
sugary
malts
nice
mouthfeel
but
ultimately
too
syrupy
am
very
envious
of
those
who
have
tried
it
on
cask
id
imagine
this
would
be
a
real
winner
in
that
format
a
nice
brown
ale
it
poursa
nice
and
bark
brown
with
a
respectable
head
the
aroma
was
a
bit
nutty
and
somewhat
sweet
the
first
sip
is
about
what
you
would
expect
from
the
aroma
relatively
easy
to
drink
all
in
all
nothing
to
write
to
momma
about
semi
clear
amberish
brown
with
a
bubbly
lace
that
fades
slowly
rich
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
butterscotch
and
ripe
dates
big
toasted
maltiness
with
an
underlying
fruitiness
and
buttery
flavours
tad
estery
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
hops
are
vague
a
only
aim
to
balance
with
virtually
no
flavour
finishes
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
toasted
grain
all
over
a
great
brown
ale
to
have
around
all
the
time
this
one
is
a
keeper
real
deep
but
not
hazy
dark
brown
color
head
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
aroma
of
dark

with
just
the

nice
maltaccentuated
example
of
style
a
little
flattercarbonationwise
than
most
which
i
thought
took
away
from
the
beer
lots
of
malt
for
sure
with
a
sugary
fruity
caramel
flavor
that
was
quite
good
at
first
but
toward
the
end
is
a
little
too
sweet
i
thought
this
brown
ale
was
one
of
the
tastiest
most
complex
renditions
ive
tried
i
wasnt
impressed
notes
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
use
of
malt
all
the
flavours
have
been
pulled
from
the
grain
creating
a
very
full
complete
and
complex
brew
by
far
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
produced
in
the
us
overall
the
uniquness
of
this
beer
was
worth
the
try
the
combination
of
earthy
notes
with
hops
made
it
fairly
interesting
good
beer
for
night
out
by
the
fire
in
spring
taste
and
smell
has
a
woodsy
note
smuttynose
never
disappoints
as
described
a
hoppy
brown
overall
enjoying
this
one
very
much
maybe
i
am
just
in
the
mood
for
a
hoppy
brown
ale
or
maybe
its
just
plain
tasty
serving
type
bottle
o
i
wanted
to
like
it
but
just
too
many
off
characteristics
to
be
good
a
misfire
while
not
especially
complex
this
remains
a
lively
flavorful
brown
ale
with
a
little
something
for
everyone
another
intriguing
dark
offering
from
smuttynose
almost
too
many
flavors
hit
the
tongue
at
once
like
alot
of
smuttynose
beers
like
brown
ales
and
hoppy
beers
just
not
together
very
filling
was
so
looking
fwd
to
this
one
sadly
not
my
flavor
overall
a
crushing
delicious
hoppy
brown
ale
good
stuff
dad
loves
this
beer
dad
says
this
is
actually
an
underrated
black
ipa
blast
of
hops
on
the
nose
blast
of
hops
on
the
palate
juicy
and
delicious
mmmmm
good
dad
highly
recommends
this
and
also
says
that
anyone
who
doesnt
like
it
probably
could
use
a
spanking
o
like
the
dirt
bikes
and
mud
racers
on
the
bottle
art
this
may
not
be
the
most
manicured
pretty
ale
however
as
a
hop
booze
and
chocolate
malt
monster
it
succeeds
wildly
the
flavors
are
intense
and
everevolving
making
for
a
engaging
tasting
and
at
14
for
a
12pack
an
awesome
deal
for
an
imperial
brew
beer
type
be
damned
without
the
sweet
label
i
would
have
pegged
this
for
a
stone
bastardvariant
not
a
bad
thing
in
the
least
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
medium
bodied
brown
ale
very
smooth
overall
as
someone
who
is
not
usually
into
brown
ales
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
it
seems
to
fit
the
description
well
a
hoppy
brown
ale
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
caramel
malts
id
put
this
behind
dogifishs
indian
brown
ale
as
my
second
favorite
brown
ale
to
date
smuttynose
makes
some
of
the
best
beers
for
the
price
in
my
area
at
9
99
a
six
pack
and
around
30
for
a
case
this
particular
one
is

abv
huge
bang
for
your
buck
o
i
like
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
a
black
ipa
and
a
strong
ale
like
a
stone
arrogant
bastard
it
is
not
at
all
like
a
typical
brown
ale
its
too
hoppy
and
too
strong
for
that
style
but
whatever
you
call
it
its
good
o
bold
flavor
dry
lightly
chalky
with
a
dry
woodys
citrus
hopping
so
hoppy
its
like
a
brown
ipa
awesome
and
big
o
complex
aromas
and
flavor
very
nicely
done
delivers
as
advertised
a
hoppy
brown
ale
i
prefer
brown
ales
to
be
less
hoppy
overall
it
does
a
mighty
fine
job
at
being
a
hopped
up
brown
pours
brown
with
lasting
tan
foam
decent
lacing
aroma
is
dominated
by
heavy
pine
very
nice
taste
is
initially
wonderful
nice
hopmalt
balance
but
finish
is
a
bit
dry
and
tart
had
this
almost
dirt
like
flavor
ive
had
many
hopped
up
browns
before
and
this
is
easily
one
of
the
worst
ive
had
i
love
hops
but
had
almost
no
characteristic
of
a
brown
ale
excellent
choice
for
winter
and
spring
huge
hoppy
brown
perfect
balance
get
it
while
you
can
o
enjoyable
with
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
though
rather
than
a
hoppy
brown
ale
it
seems
more
like
a
hybrid
of
a
brown
ale
and
a
black
ipa
slightly
hoppier
and
bittern
than
i
might
have
preferred
but
still
a
decent
one
worth
trying
overall
a
bit
harsh
on
the
bitterness
front
but
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
that
has
brings
complexity
to
the
palate
really
liked
this
id
consider
it
more
of
a
brown
ipa
with
how
hoppy
it
is
but
who
cares
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
my
favorite
brewery

faint

malt
pine
light

herbal

strong

finish
more
of
a
black
ipa
than
a
brown
ale
pretty
good
brew
it
could
use
a
tad
bit
more
roasted
malt
for
what
they
are
going
for
a
must
try
they
call
it
a
brown
ipa
hey
why
not
its
not
your
typical
brown
ale
and
it
turned
out
fantastic
refreshing
yet
deeper
flavors
then
just
hops
or
sugary
malts
this
one
surprised
me
worth
having
again
exactly
as
advertised
a
hoppy
brown
good
beer
for
a
campfire
overall
this
was
much
better
than
i
expected
and
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
again
if
they
keep
this
in
regular
production
a
hoppy
brown
ale
they
nailed
it
so
it
gets
a
high
score
for
a
brown
ale
malty
and
sweetens
up
when
warming
up
odd
brown
ipa
beer
i
really
enjoyed
o
this
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
in
my
opinion
i
would
not
mind
having
this
one
regularly
my
pour
quickly
resulted
in
just
under
two
fingers
of
dense
lightbrown
head
with
decent
retention
nice
sticky
lacing
appeared
fairly
quickly
as
it
fell
color
was
a
deepbrown
with
cola
highlights
srm
22
27
and
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
prevalent
malt
sweetness
despite
the
label
calling
it
a
hoppy
brown
ale
i
got
notes
of
milk
chocolate
light
smoke
and
some
mild
grassiness
mouthfeel
was
rather
full
and
creamy
the
taste
was
much
more
bitter
than
the
nose
had
led
me
to
expect
it
had
an
overkilned
roastiness
to
it
that
seemed
to
bring
its
bitterness
to
the
forefront
i
do
not
know
how
i
feel
about
this
as
i
like
my
coffee
hot
black
and
bitter
like
some
of
my
women
in
my
beer
though
i
feel
like
there
is
such
a
thing
as
too
much
bitterness
and
this
was
pressing
that
limit
finish
continued
to
have
an
unbalanced
burnt
bitterness
that
was
just
more
than
i
could
get
behind
frankly
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
blackcascadian
ipa
and
i
do
not
like
them
for
the
same
burnt
smoky
reason
hmm
what
shall
i
review
next
not
a
session
beer
i
give
it
a
3
75
on
taste
not
because
it
fit
the
style
so
much
but
because
it
is
interesting
and
i
appreciate
that
this
one
is
good
to
enjoy
just
one
of
then
switch
to
something
different
perhaps
friendlier
this
case
will
last
a
while
but
at
over
8
and
with
the
hop
flavor
such
as
it
is
thatll
probably
be
okay
more
like
an
arrogant
bastard
type
asa
than
a
typical
american
brown
or
even
a
brown
ipa
not
what
i
had
in
mind
when
i
was
shopping
for
a
sessionable
sunny
saturday
grilling
chillin
beer
wish
they
had
put
the
abc
on
the
packaging
somewhere
i
dont
see
it
on
either
the
bottles
or
packaging
sorry
if
i
missed
it
i
ended
up
dumping
these
in
the
communal
cooler
for
more
sturdier
drinkers
than
myself
would
drink
again
for
sure
but
dont
expect
a
run
of
the
mill
simple
basic
brown
ale
tried
at
bottle
share
at
todays
swamp
head
release
pours
murky
brownish
orange
with
no
head
aroma
of
caramel
burnt
toffee
bitter
pine
hops
flavor
follows
similarly
with
notes
of
caramel
and
toffee
burnt
sugar
earthy
hops
with
bitterness
on
the
finish
more
hoppy
american
barleywine
than
brown
ale
really
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
low
carbonation
overall
a
decent
brew
but
maybe
a
bit
harsh
overall
enjoyed
this
one
the
floaties
eventually
settled
to
the
bottom
and
i
supped
the
last
quarter
quite
carefully
would
seek
it
out
again
hopefully
floatiefree
nice
creamy
enjoyable
beer
o
the
balance
of
this
beer
seemed
to
be
somewhat
off
and
has
too
much
bitterness
and
not
enough
malty
flavors
i
wish
that
it
had
more
nutty
flavors
so
it
would
have
tasted
like
an
imperial
brown
ale
if
there
was
such
a
style
o
i
like
this
style
brown
ale
is
usually
that
once
in
a
while
but
usually
disappointed
experience
hoppy
brown
ales
are
ranking
up
there
with
some
of
my
favorite
beers
this
is
no
exception
this
very
american
twist
on
what
i
would
usually
consider
a
lackluster
style
is
really
enjoyable
and
seems
fitting
for
the
mud
season
up
in
maine
once
the
ground
thaws
at
least
overall
this
is
a
dry
hopped
beer
with
a
pretty
harsh
bitterness
that
after
a
few
sips
i
found
it
kind
of
too
much
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
balanced
and
aged
might
do
it
some
good
it
is
a
deep
brown
in
the
glass
with
plenty
of
head
nice
and
foamy
the
aroma
is
sweet
the
taste
similarly
is
sweet
and
robust
the
malt
taste
is
roasty
and
also
sticks
with
you
this
is
an
exceptional
brown
highly
recommended
o
this
beer
is
good
but
not
quite
outstanding
too
much
going
on
and
the
lingering
bitter
taste
moves
it
out
of
the
outstanding
range
that
being
said
phase
1
yeast
and
phase
2
nuttiness
are
very
very
good
i
would
revisit
this
beer
with
some
pretzels
present
to
buffer
the
bitter
even
mouthfeel
moderate
fullness
pours
a
deep
cloudy
brown
with
a
great
big
tan
head
seriously
well
over
two
fingers
and
this
thing
has
great
retention
to
boot
worth
noting
are
the
wee
floaters
at
the
bottom
i
wish
brewers
would
tell
me
when
their
beers
are
bottle
conditioned
the
smell
though
is
great
it
has
a
rich
nutty
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
the
hops
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
little
more
hops
and
some
light
bready
notes
as
well
there
is
a
nice
thickness
to
it
and
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
great
melding
of
a
traditional
brown
with
american
craft
brewing
styles
very
smooth
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
near
medium
body
i
prefer
it
super
chilled
good
beer
in
a
weak
style
this
is
what
every
beer
called
a
brown
ipa
should
taste
like
cheers
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
has
simple
yet
tasty
flavors
that
work
well
together
the
alcohol
is
masked
way
to
well
drinks
like
a
5
beer
so
be
careful
a
nice
hoppy
brown
ale
that
sounds
contradictory
but
it
worked
very
well
would
drink
this
anytime
the
beer
is
just
a
big
mean
beast
of
a
brown
ale
a
definite
exception
in
the
style
it
is
so
deliciously
complex
and
big
my
beer
guru
brought
this
one
over
to
share
very
good
looking
beer
that
had
a
good
smell
taste
is
not
what
i
would
want
bitter
and
smokey
overwhelms
the
beer
however
it
had
an
outstanding
texture
that
i
would
say
was
perfect
abv
gives
bonus
points
overall
its
a
nice
fun
take
on
a
brown
but
id
probably
like
to
have
some
malt
with
this
in
a
way
it
seems
a
bit
of
a
clash
and
not
as
complimentary
but
still
a
very
good
beer
all
around
saw
this
initiatially
in
ba
magazine
and
their
review
was
spot
on
great
aroma
without
a
hint
of
the
abv
of
8
4
cloudy
brown
aoorearance
with
a
nice
toffee
smell
mouthfeel
was
again
spot
onvery
much
in
the
comfort
beer
style
meaning
a
great
beer
to
relax
with
and
i
think
it
drinks
very
close
to
a
more
complex
stout
will
buy
more
cheers
o
a
great
hoppy
brown
ale
and
for
me
that
is
really
saying
something
since
i
normally
dislike
hoppier
brown
ales
durty
is
really
easy
to
drink
despite
its
complexity
and
strength
i
definitely
recommend
it
highly
o
this
combination
worked
well
for
me
i
was
afraid
that
the
hops
would
overpower
they
are
certainly
noticeable
but
so
is
the
sweet
malty
notes
of
the
brown
ale
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
an
often
bland
category
of
beer
kind
of
a
fogged
brown
on
this
one
this
is
a
rich
brown
ale
that
wasnt
as
hopped
as
i
was
anticipating
i
suppose
the
bold
claim
of
hoppy
on
the
name
of
the
beer
boosted
my
expectations
good
earth
tone
nice
spiced
edges
this
is
an
appropriate
use
of
hops
on
a
beer
that
people
would
think
shouldnt
be
using
it
too
much
i
like
it
i
really
wasnt
digging
this
one
the
malt
bill
is
too
roasted
and
scorched
bitter
grapefruit
is
all
that
jumps
out
for
the
hops
however
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
enjoyable
durty
beer
deep
mahogany
brown
body
with
a
big
tan
head
forming
thick
as
herbaceous
and
hoppy
as
some
black
ipas
fine
speckled
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
gives
off
a
semi
sweet
roasted
malt
character
with
hints
of
herbaceous
hops
citrus
pith
with
the
dark
roasted
malt
character
rustic
brown
ale
heavy
hops
dank
bitterness
on
the
palate
rush
of
herbaceous
bitterness
with
a
begrudging
kick
of
alcohol
on
the
palate
in
the
backend
i
had
no
clue
it
was
as
high
in
alcohol
as
it
is
hop
particles
are
floating
in
the
bottom
of
my
glass
visually
its
appealing
and
it
must
add
a
good
bit
of
flavor
textures
are
dark
resinous
slightly
stick
with
a
healthy
amount
of
hops
and
natural
carbonation
flowing
forth
so
smoothly
overall
im
happy
to
be
impressed
by
smuttynose
recent
finest
kind
ipas
have
been
slacking
with
this
beer
its
really
easy
to
enjoy
smuttynose
again
honestly
this
beer
is
delicious
i
had
to
get
over
the
fact
that
its
not
a
brown
ale
or
even
a
black
ipa
to
fully
enjoy
what
this
beer
is
and
what
is
should
have
been
intended
to
be
a
whole
hearted
true
blooded
perfect
example
of
an
american
stout
pours
a
deep
chocolate
with
a
bright
white
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
muddied
with
dark
fruits
and
molasses
hiding
the
candy
orange
notes
the
bitter
finish
is
where
we
really
get
down
to
it
it
starts
all
candy
smooth
citrus
and
rolls
into
easy
malt
before
waves
of
grapefruit
bitterness
crash
in
on
the
finish
my
favorite
from
smuttynose
beautiful
hoppy
brown
ale
or
should
i
say
brown
ipa
i
was
caught
in
surprise
by
its
potent
flavors
the
flavors
of
dark
fruit
and
roasted
grain
presence
wtih
mild
grapefruit
from
the
hops
is
fresh
and
brings
a
bit
of
yeast
with
which
has
a
dark
cherrylike
tinge
light
coffee
flavor
with
some
ruby
red
type
grapefruit
with
sweet
toasted
malt
as
it
finishes
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
imperial
brown
very
drinkable
considering
the
abv
the
malt
is
balanced
well
with
lots
of
hop
flavor
this
is
a
very
solid
brown
ale
its
pretty
unique
for
the
style
it
feels
like
a
hybrid
nice
brew
really
stoked
on
this
beer
right
now
probably
my
favorite
brown
ale
in
a
long
time
and
i
will
score
it
appropriately
the
hops
are
big
enough
to
make
you
notice
but
arent
over
the
top
like
most
similar
brews
these
days
this
beer
strikes
a
balance
i
dont
find
often
and
hopefully
more
people
appreciate
it
like
i
do
oh
yea
insanely
smooth
for
8
4
i
really
hope
smutty
keeps
this
one
around
o
nice
unique
bigger
abv
ale
excellently
crafted
overall
a
tasty
hop
driven
brown
ale
overall
nice
hoppy
brown
ale
this
style
has
evolved
quite
a
bit
over
the
years
this
one
is
delicious
o
i
dont
really
like
the
hop
character
in
this
one
i
think
its
a
bit
too
much
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brown
but
i
was
really
hoping
for
some
hops
that
was
advertised
on
the
label
would
like
to
try
it
on
draft
but
i
will
not
seek
this
out
in
bottles
again
o
okay
so
this
is
a
combination
of
greatness
it
has
the
smuttynose
factor
the
big
brown
ale
factor
the
ipa
factor
then
blend
it
all
together
and
you
have
an
ale
that
may
indeed
have
a
sort
of
cheesy
label
but
an
ale
packed
with
so
much
class
within
its
almost
worth
calling
everyone
you
know
just
to
tell
them
just
how
damn
good
durty
really
is
or
you
could
keep
it
to
yourself
and
drink
them
all
up
smuttynose
need
to
add
this
to
the
yearly
release
list
bc
it
sure
is
an
instant
classic
packed
plum
full
of
flavor
and
brilliance
geez
is
this
thing
good
or
what
o
yum
hoppy
brownsporters
can
be
pretty
hitormiss
but
this
one
works
very
effectively
its
all
about
the
integration
of
flavors
nothing
here
really
clashes
that
and
its
superbly
easy
to
drink
lets
just
say
im
pretty
glad
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
the
flavor
has
a
definitive
toasted
malt
flavor
up
front
the
hop
bitterness
is
muted
but
still
very
present
in
all
a
good
balance
the
body
is
typical
as
is
the
carbonation
level
some
alcohol
warmth
overall
a
balanced
easytodrink
brown
ale
albeit
a
more
bitter
americanized
version
what
a
treat
to
find
this
on
tap
big
on
flavours
and
delivers
pure
class
probably
my
least
favorite
smuttynose
to
date
i
just
could
not
get
past
the
burnt
and
overwhelmingly
piney
flavor
maybe
its
the
fact
that
my
expectation
was
very
low
as
the
combination
of
high
hoppiness
and
a
brown
ale
does
not
work
for
me
but
this
is
really
really
good

drinkable

its

more

caliber
nice
job
smuttynose
lets
face
it
they
know
how
to
do
brown
ales
o
smuttynoses
hoppy
offerings
never
thrill
me
for
some
reason
this
one
is
no
exception
though
i
do
applaud
the
effort
and
it
wins
points
for
its
strength
which
doesnt
detract
from
its
drinkability
i
guess
i
just
appreciate
the
citrusy
hops
more
since
every
ipa
ive
had
from
smuttynose
has
been
certainly
more
in
the
earthy
vein
yet
of
course
this
only
makes
me
want
to
revisit
finest
kind
and
big
a
to
reinforce
my
thought
process
stay
tuned
for
the
edit
of
this
review
o
very
nice
beer
and
a
different
take
on
the
style
very
enjoyable
seasonal
overall
an
excellent
beer
from
smuttynose
taste

dark
malts
then
orange
lemon
and
pineapple
hops
with
a
malty
and
bready
finish
roasty
and
slightly
citrusy
aftertaste

wow
thats
good

a

character
and
some

and
some
acidity
that
stimulates
the

prickle
on

tongue
between
quaffs
i
have
to
say
that
im
surprised
at
how
much
i
like
this
beer
perhaps
a
little
too
medicinal
at
the
finish
but
really
top
notch
another
reason
why
smuttynose
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
a
hoppy
brown
as
advertised
a
really
exceptional
quality
brew
remains
very
tasty
to
the
end
one
of
the
best
values
in
all
of

deep
dark
murky
muddy
brown
in
the
glass
the
head
is
quite
thick
and
frothy
to
start
light
khaki
in
color
with
a
ton
of
stuff
sticking
to
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
roasty
chocolaty
and
pretty
typical
for
a
darker
brown
ale
along
with
the
solid
malt
profile
there
is
also
a
good
deal
of
piney
and
earthy
hop
the
taste
is
actually
led
by
the
hops
in
this
one
with
a
both
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
hitting
out
front
after
the
hops
the
malts
are
there
again
mainly
roasted
and
black
which
give
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
while
there
are
perhaps
less
of
the
caramels
and
other
lighter
malts
that
are
more
typical
for
a
brown
ale
the
body
is
heavy
and
somewhat
chewy
this
is
combined
with
an
incredibly
bitter
dry
finish
that
really
coats
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
pleasing
offering
a
novel
blend
of
a
brown
ale
and
ipa
which
happens
to
take
the
best
characteristics
of
both
overall
a
great
brown
ale
amazing
its
this
big
i
get
no
booziness
just
a
full
bodied
and
full
flavored
brown
ale
really
well
done
this
beer
drinks
like
a
brown
with
all
the
roast
and
smoothness
you
would
expect
the
hops
are
an
addition
and
not
the
focus
but
contribute
to
the
drink
by
adding
a
bit
of
pizazz
to
the
toasty
flavors
and
not
by
stripping
the
beer
of
its
identity
as
a
brown
ale
a
classic
brown
ale
with
a
bit
of
cheerful
hops
to
carry
it
off
with
a
decidedly
sunny
disposition
overall
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
beers
that
has
come
from
smuttynose
in
recent
years
nice
brown
malts
nice
sweet
characters
nice
balance
between
malts
and
booze
and
lots
of
nice
hops
that
do
get
a
little
overbearing
through
not
messing
around
this
brown
ale
is
down
and
durty
showing
influences
of
traditional
northern
british
browns
but
with
a
distinct
american
twist
i
just
needed
the
hop
influence
to
trend
earlier
giving
me
more
bright
citrus
aromas
and
a
more
hopbalanced
middle
palate
but
the
ale
finishes
confident
a
good
effort
but
falls
short
a
little
bit
too
bitter
overly
bitter
for
my
liking
good
fruity
hop
character
which
truly
dominates
the
malt
backbone

an
inch
of
head
medium
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
hot
chocolate
mix
nuts
coffee
and
light
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
more
of
that
hot
chocolate
mix
along
with
some
citrus
and
pine
nuts
bread
roasted
malts
and
earth
lots
of
different
flavors
here
bitter
at
the
finish
with
more
hot
cocoa
and
piney
hops
floral
hints
somewhat
of
a
heavy
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
carbonation
surprisingly
not
too
much
of
an
alcohol
presence
overall
great
offering
from
smuttynose
that
ill
be
buying
again
overall
the
first
hoppy
brown
i
have
had
and
it
wont
be
the
last
love
the
combo
very
tasty
and
it
helps
that
its
a
seasonal
the
taste
has
this
quick
sweetness
at
the
start
but
it
takes
about
a
second
for
it
to
be
overtaken
by
the
earthy
hop
character
that
is
lingering
out
back
the
grass
is
more
noticeable
in
the
taste
than
in
the
scent
but
it
still
has
the
nutty
characters
overall
something
i
would
love
to
have
again
very
sessionable
with
an
8
percent
abv
while
i
have
had
some
indian
brown
ales
before
this
is
my
favorite
to
date
the
balance
and
structure
are
impeccable
flavor
wise
its
nothing
new
but
the
greatness
is
in
the
sum
of
the
parts
o
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
ill
be
honest
im
not
a
fan
of
finest
kind
but
this
is
something
i
see
myself
getting
regularly
very
dark
and
earthy
overall
very
nice
very
interesting
beer
somewhere
between
a
black
ipa
a
sweet
stout
and
a
brown
ale
but
excellent
nonetheless
overall
this
is
a
really
well
made
brown
ale
smuttynose
is
completely
underrated
in
my
opinion
try
this
beer
if
you
find
it
overall
i
loved
this
as
a
short
batch
and
i
love
it
as
a
six
pack
thanks
smuttynose
for
making
this
seasonal
super
smooth
over
the
tongue
and
ends
with
a
lingering
malthopped
up
finish
nice
stuff
go
get
some
overall
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
satisfies
my
craving
for
hops
and
gives
me
the
roastiness
i
like
in
malts
will
be
getting
this
one
again
a
quick
taste
of
sweet
malt
quickly
gives
way
to
piney
hops
then
the
mouth
is
hopping
with
the
spicy
floral
and
citrus
hops
it
comes
back
around
to
a
sweet
bread
flavor
then
finishes
dry
with
oak
and
earthy
notes
as
it
warms
the
complexities
come
together
with
more
of
a
harmony
this
is
really
nicely
done
blah
blah
blah
buy
this
beer
and
check
it
out
far
from
run
of
the
mill
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
hoppy
brown
ale

drink

a
long

awhile
overall
this
is

all
of
the
flavors
work
well
together
and
are
strong
but
the
beer
drinks
lightly
in
rereading
my
review
im
not
sure
i
really
expressed
how
good
this
beer
is
might
be
my
new
favorite
for
the
style
i
decided
to
give
smuttynose
a
chance
in
my
mixnmatch
six
pack
looking
forward
to
trying
the
others
flavorwise
it
has
a
lovely
base
of
lightly
sweet
choco
it
leans
a
bit
towards
some
mocha
action
here
too
before
getting
all
hoppy
on
you
the
hops
are
somewhat
citrusy
with
some
pine
and
rind
action
going
on
i
really
like
the
balance
here
too
between
the
choco
and
the
citrus
both
aspects
linger
nicely
i
foresee
a
few
more
6packs
of
this
in
my
fridge
in
the
future

not

i

i

want
to
like
it
more

is
very

i
now
know
why
this
is

i

medium

dry
a

meh
i
dont
know
sort
of
disjointed
and
harsh
for
my
tastes
o
a
good
showing
and
a
great
beer
it
was
like
a
brown
ipa
a
very
nice
surprise
from
a
great
brewer
they
are
moving
to
a
new
facility
soon
down
the
road
i
hope
they
stay
true
to
their
roots
o
durty
is
just
a
great
beer
all
around
with
all
the
rage
surrounding
black
ipas
right
now
its
a
wonder
that
nobody
has
much
cared
to
explore
this
brown
ipa
category
i
think
these
tend
to
work
a
little
better
without
the
dueling
bitterness
and
astringency
of
hops
and
roasted
malts
it
makes
for
a
much
smoother
easier
drinking
experience
and
you
still
get
some
of
the
more
robust
malt
flavors
from
what
ive
been
told
smuttynose
intends
to
6
pack
this
and
roll
it
into
their
seasonal
lineup
i
think
thatll
prove
to
be
a
good
decision
picked
up
a
bottle
831
of
960
at
the
smuttynose
brewery
poured
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
dark
rubytinged
brown
coloring
with
a
tall
frothy
clingy
light
tan
head
that
starts
a
solid
inch
and
a
half
and
slowly
settles
into
a
quarter
inch
with
very
good
retention
the
film
clings
all
over
the
glass
aromas
are
very
hop
forward
with
a
pine
resin
richness
and
a
rich
backbone
that
blends
caramel
and
nut
sweetness
flavors
are
roasty
and
sweet
on
the
forward
tongue
with
a
robust
blend
of
nut
and
toffee
tangy
and
resiny
bitter
hops
presence
quickly
follows
with
peppery
spices
and
a
touch
of
smoke
great
lacing
all
over
the
glass
as
you
drink
and
the
beer
remains
light
and
smooth
in
mouth
the
aftertaste
is
rich
roasty
and
slightly
bitter
the
beer
is
a
pretty
decent
blend
of
an
american
brown
and
an
ipa
which
comes
off
very
interesting
and
very
drinkable
despite
the
slightly
elevated
abv
slick
light
slightly
dry
finish
with
a
subtle
sweet
linger
tasty
brew
very
enjoyable
nice
hop
profile
for
sure
but
this
is
definitely
a
dipa
with
some
minor
darker
ale
qualities
kinda
wish
there
was
more
malty
brown
qualities
but
its
good
enough
to
not
be
able
to
complain
too
much
about
it
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
and
tastes
very
similar
to
thearoma
very
hop
forward
with
resinous
hop
bitterness
dominating
the
flavor
dry
and
floral
with
grassy
hop
and
sticky
pine
needle
flavor
lingering
over
a
slightly
roasted
malt
backbone
into
adry
finish
hop
profile
is
kind
of
one
dimensional
and
the
malts
are
impossible
to
pick
up
until
it
warms
up
considerably
after
a
while
there
is
subtle
toffee
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
sweetness
along
with
burnt
toast
and
coffee
bean
this
beer
is
certainly
tasty
but
i
expected
more
from
the
brewery
that
produces
one
of
my
favorite
browns
old
brown
dog
verdict
a
very
enjoyable
hoppy
brown
ale
from
smuttynose
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
at
8
5
the
hops
are
well
integrated
with
the
richer
grainy
malt
flavors
of
the
brown
ale
definitely
worth
seeking
out
for
any
hop
head
this
is
full
bodied
with
sharp
carbonation
this
is
unique
and
tasty
great
beer
the
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
leaves
a
bit
of
a
filmy
taste
on
the
finish
overall
this
one
is
great
really
hope
this
gets
brewed
again
in
some
form
or
incarnation
pours
the
lightest
brown
or
ruby
in
the
right
light
creamy
one
finger
off
white
head
aroma
is
of
pungent
hops
with
a
caramel
sweetness
as
a
backbone
taste
is
an
intense
hoppy
bomb
but
not
overly
bitter
and
very
well
balanced
plenty
of
piney
floral
and
citrusy
hops
contending
to
be
noticed
here
everything
comes
together
to
create
an
exceptional
ipa
the
brown
ale
elements
of
the
beer
provide
a
great
malt
backbone
to
balance
the
hops
without
becoming
overly
sweet
creamy
creamy
mouthfeel
reminded
me
a
ton
of
surly
furious
which
is
a
good
thing
one
of
smuttys
homeruns
if
you
ask
me
delicious
treat
for
the
hop
craver
looking
for
a
winner
in
a
different
style
than
fill
the
shelves
highly
recommended

i
hope
they
brew
this
again
probably
my
favorite
smutty

incredibly
tasty

make
this
again
because
it
is
a
treat

a
solid
dark

with
faint

highlights
when
held
to
light
and
a
huge
fluffy
tan
head
that
persists
forever
before
sticking
lace
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
i
could
smell
the
pine
and
earthy
hops
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
of
the
bottle
pine
earth
resin
and
a
hint
of
garlic
and
citrus
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
nose
on
this
one
theres
supposed
to
be
some
malt
here
but
my
nose
cant
find
it
the
flavor
holds
a
bit
of
toffee
and
caramel
up
front
but
theres
enough
pine
and
resin
to
make
that
a
bit
hard
to
find
this
finish
actually
has
a
long
lingering
caramel
or
toffee
and
a
chocolate
and
ash
flavor
to
it
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
resinous
almost
sweet
mouthfeel
to
it
this
is
a
great
brew
im
glad
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
a
bottle
of
this
now
to
find
some
on
tap
the
beer
pours
a
surprisingly
clean
mahogany
brown
with
a
nice
finger
width
head
that
lasts
awhile
and
gives
a
sanddune
white
color
lacing
is
long
and
medium
in
size
sticking
nicely
to
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
beer
sits
in
the
glass
rather
dark
almost
black
with
nice
carbonation
moving
through
it
on
the
nose
this
beer
smells
like
heaven
big
fat
juicy
hops
mango
passion
fruit
ruby
red
grapefruit
and
a
light
caramel
sitting
below
everything
and
hinting
at
the
malts
in
this
beer
this
is
a
superb
smell
for
anything
with
hops
though
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
becomes
more
present
and
spicy
in
the
smell
on
the
taste
there
is
some
big
grapefruit
and
alcohol
with
light
caramel
and
nuts
dancing
on
the
sides
of
the
flavor
the
beer
opens
with
bitter
grapefruit
which
builds
into
spicy
alcohol
and
grapefruit
as
it
moves
towards
the
finish
light
roast
caramel
and
very
light
nuttiness
come
through
in
the
taste
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
pithy
grapefruit
with
a
light
caramel
tingle
on
the
mouth
this
beer
feels
light
and
fluffy
and
slightly
chewy
sitting
at
the
upper
end
of
a
light
body
and
lower
end
of
medium
and
leaving
the
mouth
with
a
light
sticky
layer
of
bitters
and
caramel
overall
this
beer
is
tasty
i
would
love
to
knock
back
a
six
pack
of
this
on
a
late
summer
night
or
fall
night
the
smell
is
definitely
the
most
heavenly
part
of
this
beer
hinting
far
more
at
a
double
ipa
and
actually
reminding
me
of
wookey
jack
by
firestone
walker
this
is
a
great
beer
that
really
shouldnt
be
around
for
long
due
to
its
small
batch
but
if
you
see
it
snatch
it
up
also
if
smuttynose
is
reading
this
review
please
throw
this
in
6packs
and
put
it
alongside
finest
kind
at
the
grocery
store
so
i
can
by
sixers
of
it
regularly
yes
i
realize
its
8
but
its
tasty
and
if
you
have
to
then
lower
the
percentage
and
still
put
it
in
a
sixpack
thanks
drink
this
stuff
pours
a
very
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
malts
and
burnt
brown
sugar
bit
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
there
is
a
hint
of
maple
and
cocoa
also
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
mediumbodied
though
a

a
tasty
brown
ale
very
big
toasted
barleymalt
in
the
nose
and
taste
a
hint
of

cocoa
its
allright

this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
nut
brown
nice
flavors
of
malt
mixed
well
with
the
maple
syrup
flavors
toasty
great
beer
especially
on
tap
in
a
pinball
bar
in
idaho
springs
colorado
the
better
of
the
beers
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
but
still
just
above
average
mud
brown
in
color
thin
tasting
not
very
strong
in
flavor
this
is
tommyknockers
most
popular
beer
and
its
pretty
good
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
browns
but
the
maple
flavor
gives
it
a
nice
balance
great
to
have
in
their
sampler
pack
so
you
can
try
a
bunch
of
different
styles
a
decent
enough
ale
the
maple
sugar
makes
its
appearance
after
a
few
lingering
sips
and
makes
for
a
nice
touch
flavorwise
the
body
seems
a
bit
weak
at
times
and
the
aroma
very
lowkey
yet
the
malty
flavors
ultimately
prevail
good
nut
brown
color
with
thin
light
tan
collar
decent
lacing
aroma
is
maple
sweetness
and
a
nuttycaramel
aroma
as
well
taste
is
also
nutty
caramel
with
the
maple
taking
a
big
presence
thin
body
for
a
brown
and
low
carbonation
needs
a
better
malt
backbone
and
maybe
some
more
hops
both
up
front
and
at
the
end
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
amber
color
and
poured
a
nice
tan
head
i
was
afraid
of
this
one
after
tasting
their
imperial
nut
brown
which
i
did
not
like
this
i
must
say
is
much
better
in
my
opinion
and
actually
you
can
taste
the
beer
and
not
the
high
abv
of
the
imperial
the
beer
had
a
nice
maple
taste
and
was
really
good
i
will
buy
this
one
again
respect
to
idaho
springs
for
this
mountain
town
brown
it
does
the
job
of
being
flavorful
and
drinkable
give
this
to
a
newcastle
brown
ale
lover
this
is
a
clear
chestnut
brown
beer
the
head
is
fizzy
and
a
bit
thin
nice
malty
nutty
scent
i
didnt
get
much
maple
in
the
aroma
but
there
is
a
pleasant
toast
smell
a
bit
more
maple
comes
out
in
the
flavor
semi
sweet
and
malty
medium
in
body
this
is
a
better
than
average
enjoyable
brew
pours
out
to
a
thin
buff
head
that
makes
an
honest
attempt
to
lace
the
glass
clear
brown
color
aroma
is
maple
with
a
hint
of
nuts
and
malt
flavor
is
nutty
malty
and
slightly
sweet
with
a
crisp
finish
light
mouthfeel
not
syrupy
at
all
overall
good
quaff
this
is
a
wonderful
session
beer
that
you
could
gulp
over
and
over
again
the
maple
sweetness
blends
beautifully
with
the
nutty
flavor
and
is
wonderfully
drinkable
pairs
great
with
breakfast
food
or
after
a
day
of
skiing
or
snowshoeing
or
around
a
campfire
o
this
beer
will
go
great
with
breakfast
buy
a
couple
for
next
weekends
bacon
and
eggs
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
light
bubbly
head
slight
lacing
nose
is
malty
and
sweet
malt
grains
sweetened
with
what
seems
like
a
little
too
much
maple
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
o
solid
brown
ale
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
maple
overall
this
is
actually
probably
decent
for
the
style
but
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
so
im
a
bad
judge
true
to
style
good
head
that
dissipates
quickly
bubbles
look
uniform
but
lay
a
nice
brussels
lace
the
maple
is
subdued
not
artificial
tasting
subtle
has
kind
of
an
earthy
meaty
aroma
and
mouthful
i
wasnt
expecting
but
like
a
bit
sweet
as
expected
but
not
heavy
tastes
more
complex
as
it
warms
very
easy
drinking
i
think
ill
have
another
overall
decent
but
there
are
other
browns
that
id
prefer
over
this
overall
a
good
session
beer
for
those
who
like
their
brown
ales
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
this
is
the
beer
i
would
take
camping
and
have
several
by
an
open
fire
o
i
cannot
say
that
this
is
a
special
beer
but
is
enjoyable
brown
beers
have
never
been
a
favorite
but
this
one
stands
out
in
that
respect
overall
methinks
tommyknocker
took
things
a
bit
too
far
with
this
one
a
smaller
dose
of
maple
could
have
made
this
interesting
enough
and
more
hops
and
less
chocolate
may
have
helped
to
highlight
the
star
flavor
by
adding
more
juxtaposition
a
fuller
mouthfeel
was
definitely
called
for
in
my
opinion
especially
considering
the
style
guidelines
surrounding
this
beer
good
aroma
with
a
decent
head
sweet
maple
notes
on
the
nose
with
a
slight
malt
scent
the
flavor
was
sweet
but
not
too
much
but
the
malt
and
hops
were
almost
hidden
a
little
bit
of
a
nutty
flavor
from
the
malt
along
with
the
maple
flavor
a
good
nut
ale
the
mouth
feel
was
light
and
the
beer
itself
didnt
weigh
me
down
like
some
nut
ales
do
is
a
good
summer
nut
ale
not
bad
i
was
hoping
for
something
with
a
little
more
punch
and
creativity
from
the
sound
of
it
and
this
was
very
subdued
but
its
pretty
good
overall
and
definitely
better
than
the
low
average
score
im
seeing
on
here
i
think
personally
surprised
by
this
beer
to
be
honest
its
not
fantastic
but
its
a
solid
beer
from
a
brewery
i
hadnt
heard
of
before
buying
the
bottle
its
a
slightly
above
average
nut
brown
ale
with
some
characteristics
of
maple
syrup
if
thats
your
bag
definitely
try
it
out
and
considering
im
having
this
beer
a
month
past
its
drinkby
date
it
could
only
at
least
be
slightly
better
fresh
at
a
measly
20
ibus
this
could
be
a
great
beer
for
somebody
that
doesnt
like
to
drink
anything
other
than
bud
light
because
they
think
it
all
just
tastes
bitter
what
awonderful
tasting
beer
looks
great
in
the
glass
a
slight
taste
of
maple
but
what
a
great
tasteing
beer
a
great
brown
ale
find
it
drink
not
hoppy
so
happy
about
that
wonderful
enjoy
a
smooth
taste
goes
down
easy
this
is
a
sexy
looking
beer
a
beer
that
puts
a
smile
on
your
face
o
really
this
isnt
bad
but
its
infinitely
forgettable
revisiting
some
tommyknocker
brownness
now
that
theyve
apparently
infiltrated
the
chicagoland
market
this
one
pours
a
clear
sunrise
garnet
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
glowing
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
caramel
light
cashew
a
hallmark
of
tommyknocker
it
seems
and
a
pinch
of
chocolate
powder
things
are
restrained
as
though
they
dont
really
wanna
be
here
but
their
parents
made
them
its
characterbuilding
of
course
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
maple
syrup
some
vague
and
mild
fruit
tones
pervading
the
background
and
an
even
vaguer
sense
of
mixed
greens
throughout
this
would
usually
be
a
decent
enough
combination
but
here
the
flavors
dont
meld
well
they
bicker
and
argue
over
whos
gonna
kill
who
with
nothing
ever
getting
done
in
the
end
much
less
anything
truly
tasty
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wetly
fluid
feel
overall
an
okay
brown
but
the
flavors
just
dont
work
together
and
things
run
a
bit
too
thinly
for
their
own
good
the
tk
maple
nut
brown
ale
is
a
decent
brown
ale
and
i
would
recommend
it
the
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
that
did
not
leave
much
lacing
the
scent
carried
sweet
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
maple
the
taste
was
a
very
nicely
balance
ale
that
was
not
overly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
brown
ale
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
im
not
a
big
fan
not
what
i
was
expecting
o
the
taste
redeems
it
to
a
certain
degree
but
a
good
beer
has
more
than
one
element
the
mouthfeel
almost
messes
up
the
taste
because
if
how
thin
it
is
if
they
could
just
beer
this
thing
up
from
4
5
and
add
a
little
oomph
to
the
body
do
something
for
the
aroma
this
thing
would
be
awesome
cheers
this
was
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
the
maple
was
not
overpowering
which
helped
me
enjoy
it
more
overall
drinkability
a
very
tasty
beer
and
very
sessionable
to
boot
i
could
easily
have
another
by
itself
but
i
find
with
food
the
beer
really
works
ive
had
it
with
burgers
and
it
was
fantastic
and
with
pulled
pork
bbq
it
works
well
again
not
a
perfect
combination
with
the
bbq
but
still
good
definitely
glad
i
got
the
6
pack
of
this
when
i
saw
it
a
bit
disappointing
in
the
aroma
dept
but
still
quite
good
overall
overall
ive
never
had
another
ale
like
this
one
its
great
overall
not
extremely
intriguing
but
not
dull
either
and
still
very
goodtasting
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
dark
rich
brown
body
with
a
small
beige
head
that
doesnt
stay
up
to
long
the
smell
is
rich
of
maple
notes
and
brown
sugar
and
roaste
malt
the
taste
is
rich
of
toasty
malt
with
a
nice
flavor
of
maple
syrup
not
a
lot
of
spice
though
the
mouth
feel
is
really
smooth
and
doesnt
leave
a
after
taste
overall
this
is
a
really
good
bronw
ale
overall
no
more
or
less
than
youd
expect
from
the
name
maple
is
evident
and
adds
a
bit
of
complexity
to
an
otherwise
pretty
standard
brown
ale
o
really
pretty
tasty
i
would
not
turn
this
one
down
in
fact
i
think
its
my
favorite
tommyknocker
brew
to
date
glad
to
recommend
this
beer
o
a
good
rendition
on
a
nut
brown
ale
o
an
alright
brown
ale
the
maple
is
not
very
pronounced
if
at
all
id
drink
another
one
but
not
a
brew
id
keep
coming
back
to
overall
as
a
brown
ale
its
kind
of
a
bland
looking
ale
with
a
watered
down
mouthfeel
but
honestly
this
is
the
best
tasting
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
nutty
syrupy
it
is
perfect
in
that
aspect
definitely
100
what
the
name
of
the
beer
suggested
when
it
comes
down
to
it
i
feel
that
the
biggest
aspect
is
taste
and
smell
and
it
does
win
you
over
in
that
sense
nice
mostly
sweet
but
very
drinkable
not
exciting
but
it
does
the
trick
o
its
a
surprising
beer
its
a
brown
ale
but
it
has
very
light
flavors
it
has
a
nice
sweetness
that
is
subtle
but
you
know
its
there
not
a
lot
of
backbone
to
this
beer
very
drinkable
at
4
5
abv
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
pretty
good
easy
drinking
and
at
4
5
abv
have
another
decent
brown
but
not
in
my
top
5
maple
flavor
comes
through
in
the
sweet
malt
has
nutty
earth
brown
ale
middle
finishes
dry
with
an
herbal
punch
that
leads
towards
phenol
as
it
warms
a
decent
brown
ale
but
nothing
special
pours
out
a
brown
color
with
reddish
fringes
and
a
brief
single
finger
head
no
lacing
the
nose
is
lightly
toasted
bread
and
nuts
but
doesnt
exhibit
as
strong
an
aroma
of
maple
syrup
as
i
had
hoped
for
however
the
flavor
does
indeed
start
out
with
a
light
amount
of
the
maple
syrup
sweetness
that
was
not
detected
on
the
nose
and
progresses
through
stages
of
murky
nutty
and
toasted
malt
but
overall
the
flavors
are
illdefined
and
not
quite
as
well
amplified
as
the
imperial
version
of
this
brew
is
body
is
on
the
thinner
side
of
medium
and
carbonation
is
just
a
tad
sluggish
for
my
tastes
overall
you
can
really
tell
that
this
is
better
passed
up
for
the
much
better
imperial
version
of
the
same
thing
its
the
same
idea
amplified
up
to
levels
that
actually
work
well
d
light
and
easy
nice
maple
syrupnut
brown
all
combination
would
recommend
to
other
who
like
really
sweet
stuff
brew
pours
a
clear
mahogany
under
a
fairly
persistent
head
a
sweet
and
crisp
aroma
of
toasted
biscuity
malt
yields
notes
of
milk
sweetness
light
cocoa
maple
and
roasted
nut
letting
this
warm
to
a
cool
temperature
from
the
fridge
before
drinking
truly
accentuates
the
flavors
and
mouth
feel
that
id
hoped
for
in
what
the
bottle
proclaims
i
think
ill
give
this
another
go
with
a
loaded
bacon
cheese
burger
do
the
maple
syrup
appears
to
have
been
added
after
fermentation
such
is
the
only
explanation
for
this
beers
monotone
sweetness
this
flavor
quality
surprises
the
palate
upon
first
encounter
and
quickly
becomes
repetitive
and
uninteresting
it
is
a
clumsy
beer
that
would
probably
be
better
off
without
the
sugar
adjuct
there
are
hints
of
real
brown
ale
scattered
about
but
unfortunately
they
are
scattered
widely
pretty
good
would
work
fine
to
wash
down
or
help
maranaide
some
bbq
overall
disappointing
compare
this
to
peak
organics
the
maple
collaboration
and
youd
think
that
its
probably
what
would
come
out
if
they
bottled
the
water
they
use
to
wash
the
mash
tuns
well
its
maybe
not
as
bad
as
all
that
but
certainly
not
very
impressive
i
wont
drink
this
again
o
the
use
of
maple
syrup
as
an
ingredient
is
quite
interesting
because
it
was
done
in
a
subtle
way
and
doesnt
prominently
stand
out
in
the
smell
or
taste
overall
this
is
a
great
nut
brown
ale
easily
drinkable
and
some
good
maple
flavors
the
only
glaring
flaw
is
the
tart
bitterness
that
comes
at
the
end
of
the
taste
either
from
the
hops
or
from
the
fermented
syrup
itself
which
ive
seen
with
other
beers
including
my
homebrew
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
best
by
422012
pours
slightly
hazy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
good
12
finger
dense
off
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
caramel
toasted
malt
biscuit
light
chocolate
roasted
nut
and
maple
syrup
some
decent
aromas
that
are
on
the
weak
side
taste
of
toasted
malt
caramel
maple
roasted
nut
and
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
a
surprising
lack
of
flavor
here
but
it
isnt
offensive
really
dry
finish
but
some
lingering
notes
of
caramel
and
maple
for
a
few
seconds
lightmedium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
as
expected
with
no
alcohol
noticed
at
all
as
expected
for
4
5
some
good
flavor
balance
for
what
is
present
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
offensive
by
any
means
but
it
really
is
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
i
wanted
it
to
be
much
more
robust
than
what
was
offered
overall
an
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
beer
this
beers
ok
quaffable
and
sessionable
o
eh
its
an
ok
beer
ive
certainly
had
better
beers
in
this
style
its
almost
good
but
its
overly
sweet
and
the
palate
is
all
over
the
place
with
bittersweet
malts
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
anyone
except
maybe
those
who
are
just
starting
to
explore
craft
beers
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
one
for
free
go
for
it
but
dont
pay
a
premium
for
it
if
you
see
it
somewhere
the
beer
feels
fine
and
does
not
really
have
off
flavors
it
just
needs
flavors
anything
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
if
they
could
manage
that
it
really
is
like
drinking
a
peanut
brittle
with
a
maple
glaze
take
that
as
you
will
medium
bodied
with
excessive
carbonation
this
beer
may
seem
a
bit
light
for
some
the
body
is
quite
refreshing
and
never
becomes
sticky
this
may
be
seen
as
a
hindrance
to
some
as
the
flavors
dont
really
have
a
chance
to
cling
to
the
palate
the
carbonation
is
almost
explosive
as
this
beer
is
held
in
the
mouth
which
certainly
helps
the
drinkability
but
definitely
gets
in
the
way
of
the
flavors
taste
is
light
soft
sweet
toasted
malt
the
flavor
is
very
mild
like
a
brown
ale
should
be
there
is
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
and
i
dont
get
any
maple
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
thintofirm
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
if
you
dont
like
this
mild
style
steer
clear
if
you
do
you
might
want
to
pick
up
a
single
of
this
and
try
it
overall
i
love
this
brown
ale
the
low
avb
is
awesome
and
this
beer
doesnt
overdo
it
like
some
other
brewers
the
maple
is
just
enough
to
get
the
point
across
a
good
representation
for
the
style
overall
i
am
sure
there
are
those
out
there
who
appreciate
this
kind
of
taste
and
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
necessarily
but
the
maple
was
just
too
over
the
top
for
me
way
too
sweet
i
had
to
drainpour
about
the
last
third
i
just
couldnt
stomach
it
anymore
i
really
like
tommyknocker
beers
but
this
one
was
just
a
little
much
overall
not
a
bad
buy
for
a
giveaway
or
for
those
days
you
dont
feel
like
drinking
a
lot
more
of
like
a
light
bock
beer
to
me
little
sweet
slightly
bitter
but
yet
easy
to
drink
music
opeth
blackwater
park
this
is
an
alright
brown
ale
the
maple
syrup
is
in
every
aspect
of
this
beer
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
dominated
by
the
syrupy
qualities
when
its
all
said
and
done
i
probably
wont
have
this
one
again
d
an
interesting
concept
but
a
disappointment
very
much
a
onenote
brew
and
even
that
was
not
well
done
o
a
nice
brown
ale
i
have
had
some
bad
brown
ales
and
this
wasnt
too
bad
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
overall
i
was
let
down
not
terrible
but
not
good
o
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
will
not
have
another
overall
im
not
crazy
about
it
but
i
have
to
say
that
it
lives
up
to
the
name
on
the
label
maple
and
nuts
the
taste
was
about
the
same
as
any
pretty
good
brown
ale
really
sweet
sugary
taste
mixed
with
a
pretty
decent
amount
of
hops
i
also
tasted
the
maple
syrup
in
it
this
went
surprisingly
well
in
this
and
i
am
always
glad
when
i
can
actually
taste
a
unique
flavor
like
this
that
the
bottle
basically
promises
most
dont
live
up
to
these
promises
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
i
have
definitely
had
better
but
that
does
not
take
anything
away
from
this
one
and
i
commend
them
on
actually
being
able
to
taste
the
maple
flavor
they
promise
this
beer
is
great
to
have
one
every
now
and
then
but
not
have
an
entire
six
pack
unless
you
are
giving
it
out
to
friends
ya
know
what
i
liked
this
one
a
very
unconventional
nut
brown
pours
a
somewhat
couldy
brown
color
with
an
average
head
smells
like
maple
but
is
it
real
maple
or
aunt
jemimas
smells
almost
too
sweet
to
be
real
maple
but
the
label
says
it
is
taste
is
a
bit
malty
and
caramel
with
a
maple
sugar
essence
on
the
back
end
cant
complain
its
drinkable
and
enticing
with
a
medium
body
the
sweetness
keeps
it
from
being
too
sessionable
but
its
a
nice
fall
beer
overall
its
soso
nice
for
a
mixed
sixer
but
i
wouldnt
but
a
whole
six
pack
of
it
sampled
from
a
bottle

mahogany
in
color
with
a
light
haze
at
first
but
clarified
once
it
warmed
a
bit
pretty
good
clarity
for
a
brown
ale
poured
with
an
aggressive
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipated
leaving
wisps
and
a
foam
ring
around
the
glass
bready
and
nutty
malt
aromas
with
hints
of
sweet
molasses
molasses
aroma
intensifies
as
the
beer
warms
up
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
a
bit
watery
with
aggressive
tangy
carbonation
earthy
malt
flavor
is
dominant
throughout
with
occasional
hints
of
nuts
and
an
underlying
sweetness
that
lingers
at
the
finish
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
go
very
well
with
spicy
foods
generally
this
brown
ale
was
pretty
simple
and
unmemorable
m
soft
smooth
and
nicely
carbonated
slightly
dry
but
very
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
no
frills
tasty
american
brown
ale
gives
the
consumer
every
expectation
one
would
expect
from
a
brown
ale
with
out
anything
offensive
i
enjoyed
this
ale
but
not
sure
if
it
would
be
a
regular
for
me
overall
drinkability
pretty
decent
no
off
characters
very
drinkable
o
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
tad
too
sweet
and
a
little
too
carboanted
ok
but
ive
had
much
better
brown
ales
o
enjoyable
especially
if
you
like
maple
certainly
sessionable
and
could
easily
be
an
easydrinking
fallback
for
a
hot
day
notes
this
one
is
solidly
hearty
cheers
o
overall
a
bit
sweet
for
my
liking
less
like
a
beer
and
more
like
a
dessert
made
with
holiday
liquor
honey
chocolate
sweetness
is
a
bit
overkill
probably
best
in
moderation
68oz
servings
as
dessert
and
not
so
well
as
a
stand
alone
drink
much
less
a
brown
ale
good
overall
tasty
good
brown
underneath
that
makes
it
a
standard
but
with
a
little
maple
kick
o
i
have
to
admit
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
low
abv
pleasant
taste
and
smell
not
a
bad
brown
ale
o
ive
had
this
before
but
this
bottle
seems
much
better
than
i
remember
this
is
certainly
an
above
average
beer
from
tommyknocker
easy
recommendation
for
people
like
me
who
love
both
beer
and
maple
syrup
o
i
was
looking
for
something
a
little
sweeter
or
flavorful
but
this
is
just
a
really
nice
easydrinking
ale
paired
nicely
with
pizza
i
havent
had
this
one
in
a
hot
minute
now
the
new
packaging
caught
my
eye
and
i
figured
id
give
it
a
whirl
again
it
is
nice
shouldve
done
it
sooner
the
brew
pours
a
lustrous
chestnutmahogany
hue
and
is
topped
with
a
pillowy
cap
of
reddishtan
froth
it
is
a
rich
and
good
looking
brew
the
nose
is
mellow
mostly
offering
sweet
roast
barley
notes
and
a
bit
of
mapley
aroma
the
flavor
is
just
a
bit
sweet
and
the
maple
is
light
but
present
it
covers
the
same
territory
as
the
nose
in
fact
this
tastes
a
bit
like
an
extremely
delicious
wort
hops
are
present
but
very
light
adding
perhaps
a
tinge
of
sweet
floral
notes
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
uk
ale
yeast
fruitiness
as
well
the
brew
also
sports
a
nice
creamy
silky
body
and
it
is
pretty
much
a
winner
allaround
o
i
like
the
idea
but
its
essentially
an
average
beer
for
me
overall
a
decent
table
beer
nothing
much
to
discuss
though
overall
a
very
pleasant
brown
ale
would
make
a
good
dessert
beer
my
wife
and
i
agree
this
is
more
of
a
fall
taste
for
sipping
around
the
fire
o
good
beer
worth
trying
overall
if
you
like
sweet
then
this
might
be
for
you
its
not
that
it
was
a
bad
beer
just
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
overall
i
liked
it
before
and
i
still
do
for
what
it
is
a
simple
maple
nut
brown
ale
it
delivers
glad
i
have
3
more
o
tommyknockers
maple
nut
brown
ale
is
a
pretty
reasonable
stab
at
an
obnoxious
idea
i
cant
say
ill
be
having
this
again
but
for
what
it
is
it
aint
half
bad
worth
the
tick
nothing
more
smoothe
on
the
tongue
with
a
very
clean
finish
lightly
carbonated
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
even
if
you
dont
normally
drink
darker
beers
i
would
at
least
try
this
as
the
maple
cleanness
to
it
makes
it
feel
less
heavy
and
dark
than
it
might
otherwise
if
however
you
are
more
like
me
and
prefer
your
beers
the
consistency
of
motor
oil
this
can
be
a
nice
refreshing
afternoon
brew
that
can
strike
a
balance
between
the
extremes
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
some
light
maple
that
mingles
nicely
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
a
touch
sweet
but
it
doesnt
detract
anything
from
the
beer
o
a
solid
brown
ale
adhering
to
this
styles
typical
characteristics
i
was
hoping
to
get
a
taste
of
maple
syrup
maybe
next
time
its
still
a
goodenjoyable
brown
ale
worth
trying
at
least
once
overall
it
was
ok
pretty
close
to
maple
syrup
i
was
hoping
for
but
could
be
closer
with
all
the
seemingly
tasty
malt
additions
to
this
recipe
something
somehow
is
lost
on
the
palate
the
beer
looks
wonderful
longlasting
head
from
carapils
though
i
suspected
wheat
and
smatters
of
lace
over
a
clear
redbrown
liquid
really
not
much
aroma
to
write
home
about
even
after
1015
minutes
sitting
there
i
only
got
a
supertiny
bit
of
lighttoasted
nut
and
definite
maple
notes
and
those
elements
only
barely
intensified
in
the
flavor
wouldnt
quite
call
this
watereddown
but
both
the
degree
of
maltmaple
flavors
and
depth
of
body
were
on
the
threshold
between
lightmoderate
overall
this
beer
aint
bad
but
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
in
taste
overall
slightly
above
average
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
but
i
would
like
to
try
another
maple
beer
if
there
exists
one
being
new
to
brown
ales
i
had
an
open
mind
this
didnt
disappoint
at
all
i
purchased
a
6
pack
sampler
and
chose
this
as
my
first
so
far
so
good
poured
nicely
into
a
short
pilsner
glass
had
nice
aroma
but
not
overwhelming
nice
lacing
but
disappeared
quickly
this
was
a
really
smooth
feel
going
down
nice
malty
caramel
and
slight
coffee
taste
was
a
little
sweet
in
the
beginning
but
seemed
to
get
more
sweet
as
i
continued
didnt
really
get
to
a
point
of
maple
syrup
though
overall
i
think
this
was
a
nice
brown
ale
experience
bear
in
mind
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
too
as
ive
only
started
breaking
into
the
browns
but
i
was
not
disappointed
so
far
im
all
about
the
brown
ales
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
certainly
original
and
definitely
hands
over
maple
syrup
as
promised
but
not
something
i
could
ever
foresee
being
in
the
mood
for
i
enjoy
the
flavors
with
some
mild
nuttytoasted
malt
flavor
and
maple
taste
is
there
peripherally
giving
a
nice
accent
with
slight
sweet
but
not
cloying
presence
i
light
the
light
dry
character
here
since
you
expect
maple
brown
as
a
beer
to
come
off
sweeter
the
taste
is
good
until
it
finishes
w
the
sweet
maple
earthy
goodness
in
the
end
i
find
the
overall
drinkability
of
this
to
be
good
but
tried
to
be
fair
according
to
the
style
which
may
not
be
accurate
according
to
what
i
got
out
of
this
a
nice
gentle
brown
more
in
the
english
style
with
complimentary
maple
that
doesnt
go
too
far
too
sweet
just
a
simple
brown
that
hits
the
spot
overall
i
think
that
is
definitely
a
unique
and
probably
suited
best
for
the
winter
or
for
someone
who
likes
really
sweet
beers
i
think
this
beer
accompanied
with
a
breakfast
stout
would
make
a
swell
meal
this
is
quite
sweet
this
could
be
a
dessert
breakfast
beer
it
kind
of
tastes
like
liquid
french
toast
not
bad
at
all
maple
syrup
has
definitely
made
its
presence
know
and
it
works
well
ordered
a
bottle
this
past
weekend
while
at
the
new
5
napkin
burger
in
the
pru
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
caramel
colored
body
moderate
head
retention
smell
was
malty
and
just
a
hint
of
woodiness
flavor
left
a
lot
of
questions
while
it
was
not
offensive
there
was
nothing
to
it
if
the
beer
is
brewed
with
maple
then
id
expect
something
along
that
line
nothing
really
stood
out
except
for
the
maltiness
you
get
in
most
brown
ales
overall
it
was
a
let
down
and
not
worth
the
marked
up
price
i
paid
at
this
restaurant
overall
this
was
an
average
brown
ale
when
i
saw
the
name
of
this
beer
i
expected
some
good
maple
syrup
flavor
but
that
wasnt
the
case
it
didnt
show
up
at
all
in
the
flavor
the
base
of
this
beer
was
good
expect
for
being
a
little
watery
if
this
was
just
labeled
as
a
nut
brown
it
would
score
higher
but
with
maple
in
its
name
it
just
didnt
live
up
to
it
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
needs
to
have
more
maple
syrup
added
to
it
and
a
little
thicker
bodied
i
thought
i
was
going
to
enjoy
this
beer
but
that
didnt
happen
got
a
single
as
a
gift
tried
it
first
since
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
brown
ales
look
and
smell
are
pretty
underwhelming
but
the
taste
is
all
right
i
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
a
6er
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
one
of
my
favorites
from
tommyknocker
it
has
a
super
roasted
feel
that
im
sure
any
coffee
lover
would
enjoy
as
i
said
a
flaw
at
least
for
me
was
that
the
crisp
carbonated
feelthat
of
which
winter
warmers
have
slowly
turn
to
a
heavier
bodied
syrup
like
taste
i
understand
this
is
a
maple
beer
but
take
my
word
and
enjoy
this
one
as
fresh
as
possible
stay
thirsty
my
friends
smelled
sweet
not
too
hoppy
very
smooth
almost
thought
it
was
a
lager
reddish
brown
looked
like
a
amber
lager
had
a
hint
taste
of
maple
very
easy
to
drink
but
wasnt
overall
impressed
not
something
id
look
for
but
would
drink
if
i
went
somewhere
and
they
had
it
there
are
better
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
solid
overall
maple
nut
brown
is
a
very
good
beer
it
has
an
excellent
nose
taste
that
excite
the
senses
the
appearance
mouthfeel
could
be
improved
a
bit
but
for
the
most
part
a
nicely
done
brown
ale
would
highly
recommend
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
there
are
several
others
in
the
style
that
are
better
this
is
still
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
thin
yet
clingy
i
wouldnt
rush
back
drinkability
is
good
beer
is
pretty
sessionable
flavors
arent
anything
extraordinary
and
maple
wasnt
as
present
as
id
like
not
something
id
keep
in
my
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
but
a
good
local
beer
this
is
a
decent
beer
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
definitely
enjoy
again
m
the
mouthfeel
again
is
the
only
offputting
aspect
but
the
maple
syrup
lingering
is
certainly
noteworthy
and
makes
this
one
stick
out
d
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
get
this
again
very
boring
flavor
and
kind
of
bland
if
it
werent
for
the
fact
i
dont
care
what
im
drinking
right
now
i
would
pour
it
down
the
drain
d
i
could
drink
a
sixpack
in
one
sitting
only
thing
i
would
be
wary
of
is
the
sweetness
of
the
drink
tommyknocker
maple
nut
brown
ale
was
mahogany
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
short
beige
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
sweet
malts
with
some
maple
syrup
the
taste
was
sweet
malt
a
bit
toasty
light
maple
syrup
flavor
and
a
little
nutty
it
finished
semidry
and
maplemalty
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
medium
body
and
mediumlight
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
worth
a
try
overall
a
nice
sessionable
brown
ale
nothing
spectacular
but
wellmade
solid
b
it
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
slight
red
no
big
smells
in
the
nose
of
this
beer
a
little
brown
sugar
and
maple
syrup
now
maybe
i
am
biased
from
everything
else
i
drank
on
this
day
but
i
was
very
disappointed
with
the
taste
it
tasted
of
a
thin
nut
brown
ale
and
a
little
bit
of
maple
it
honestly
was
not
drinkable
for
me
at
this
point
in
the
night
it
ended
up
being
a
drain
pour
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
beer
it
was
just
to
thin
and
unbalanced
i
think
i
would
of
enjoyed
it
a
little
more
if
it
was
all
i
drank
on
that
day
dwell
it
at
least
goes
down
easily
its
by
no
means
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
seems
to
be
quite
filling
its
definitely
not
a
brown
ale
ill
ever
be
getting
again
i
almost
didnt
think
this
was
beer
until
i
signed
onto
here
and
saw
that
alcohol
was
indeed
present
in
this
its
barely
discernible
and
i
could
easily
have
had
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
wont
win
any
awards
but
sometimes
its
nice
to
just
be
able
to
crack
a
beer
open
and
not
have
to
think
to
deeply
as
i
work
my
way
down
the
bottle
this
is
one
of
those
beers
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
offerings
from
tommyknocker
are
now
for
sale
here
d
a
great
drinkable
brown
ale
wish
this
would
replace
newcastle
as
the
go
to
brown
on
the
tap
handles
at
local
bars
has
a
great
finish
and
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
great
beer
to
sip
on
in
the
middle
of
a
cool
winter
day
makes
me
kind
of
want
a
pancake
though
d
with
a
light
flavor
profile
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
the
beer
was
easily
drinkable
but
i
fear
i
cant
say
it
was
more
than
just
that
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
cracked
the
bottle
i
was
expecting
flavor
to
be
much
fuller
but
i
give
the
beer
props
for
being
remarkably
easy
to
down
very
easy
to
drink
the
sweetness
rather
restrained
and
pleasant
but
lacking
in
body
and
overall
robustness
a
nice
offering
that
could
easily
reach
the
next
level
with
a
few
tweaks
poured
into
a
pint
glass
body
looks
to
have
a
brown
body
but
is
more
of
a
dark
copper
color
when
held
to
the
light
has
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
that
fades
pretty
quick
pretty
much
just
maple
and
brown
sugar
in
the
nose
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
but
i
am
picking
more
hints
of
the
maple
as
the
beer
warms
also
some
roasted
malts
decent
level
of
carbonation
but
really
thin
in
the
mouth
d
not
the
most
intiguing
aesthetically
but
quite
delicious
this
is
a
very
unique
brown
ale
i
love
the
flavors
and
aromas
with
a
few
changes
this
could
be
one
of
the
best
browns
out
there
the
flavors
are
enough
to
enjoy
this
beer
recommended
dr
not
bad
at
this
price
range
but
better
beers
can
be
had
in
this
style
da
good
brown
ale
goes
down
pretty
smooth
and
is
something
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
d
not
impressed
its
better
then
drinking
miller
lite
but
i
wouldnt
try
anything
else
from
this
brewery
drinkability
is
pretty
low
considering
that
i
drainpoured
about
half
of
each
bottle
its
just
too
onedimensional
and
thin
to
really
devote
much
time
to
this
was
an
interesting
brew
i
appreciate
the
unique
effort
put
in
for
the
style
but
thought
it
missed
for
the
most
part
overall
it
seemed
too
much
like
it
was
trying
to
be
both
a
faithful
brown
but
also
something
light
and
drinkable
its
worth
a
try
and
i
can
see
how
it
might
be
appealing
to
some
but
i
probably
wont
get
this
again
if
you
like
maple
syrup
youll
probably
like
this
if
you
dont
like
maple
syrup
dont
bother
i
love
a
good
brown
w
a
twist
so
i
wasnt
disappointed
but
if
you
read
the
label
on
this
beer
and
end
up
hating
this
beer
maybe
you
should
check
your
reading
skills
i
was
told
about
tommyknocker
from
an
individual
tha
wanted
to
have
it
kept
in
my
bar
needless
to
say
i
had
to
try
it
out
first
i
got
it
in
a
bottle
and
it
was
made
in
july
of
this
year
it
does
taste
a
little
flat
but
it
is
still
pretty
tasty
the
coor
when
you
pour
is
medium
brown
in
color
almost
sandy
the
smell
is
sweet
and
desirable
the
taste
is
more
a
fruity
taste
than
maple
the
nutty
flavor
really
stands
out
to
me
this
beer
is
pretty
damn
goodand
easy
to
drink
almost
too
easy
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
it
is
brown
in
color
with
dark
amber
highlights
the
aroma
is
definitely
maple
it
has
underlying
nutty
earthy
smells
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
maple
syrup
with
some
roasted
caramel
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
i
really
like
this
beer
but
it
i
dont
drink
more
than
a
couple
due
to
the
sweetness
dm
great
carbonation
and
crisp
while
being
very
drinkable
i
would
go
as
far
as
to
say
this
is
versatile
enough
to
be
a
breakfast
beer
good
price
8
50
for
six
longnecks
d
the
flatness
and
lack
of
carbonation
make
this
one
hard
to
drink
at
warmer
temperatures
however
i
do
think
the
flavour
is
quite
good
this
was
a
decent
brown
ale
the
taste
and
scent
didnt
exactly
jump
out
at
you
not
an
easy
drinker
i
found
it
difficult
to
finish
2
of
these
d
one
is
enough
for
me
for
now
but
i
really
like
the
maple
taste
so
id
try
this
one
again
first
off
if
you
dont
like
the
taste
of
maple
syrup
then
this
beer
is
just
not
for
you
if
you
do
in
fact
like
maple
syrup
then
drink
up
my
friends
this
beer
is
a
very
smooth
drink
and
i
found
that
i
finished
a
six
pack
before
i
even
got
comfortable
in
my
bar
stool
wonderful
maple
syrup
aroma
and
just
the
right
amount
of
syrup
added
to
still
taste
like
a
beer
one
of
my
personal
favorites
a
must
drink
for
maple
syrup
fans
everywhere
i
also
find
that
you
may
need
to
swirl
the
bottle
for
the
best
taste
as
the
syrup
tends
to
settle
at
the
bottom
a
delight
from
the
tommyknocker
collection
the
maple
flavor
in
this
is
excellent
nicely
done
must
try
if
you
like
maple
syrup
this
taste
exactly
like
pure
organic
maple
syrup
appears
a
dark
amber
brown
hue
with
a
thin
khaki
tan
head
forming
with
minimal
speckled
lacing
aroma
deep
sweet
fruit
and
maple
syrup
notes
theres
not
much
brown
ale
characteristic
in
the
smell
of
this
brew
fuckin
disgusting
maple
syrup
cloyingly
sweet
flavor
with
nothing
else
going
on
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
come
across
on
the
planet
it
makes
my
gag
reflux
kick
with
instant
acid
reflux
this
beer
is
terrible
thn
bodied
artificial
carbonation
these
people
should
throwin
the
towel
and
be
forced
to
chug
canadian
breakfast
stout
bombers
rom
founders
as
far
as
being
drinkable
thats
an
absolute
no
drain
pour
is
the
only
justable
end
to
this
beer
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
are
you
fuckin
kidding
me
d
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
maple
nut
browns
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
excellent
offering
and
highly
recommended
to
anyone
looking
for
a
sweet
tasty
maple
based
beer
that
wont
overload
the
taste
buds
there
is
too
much
flavor
for
a
macro
drinker
and
just
bad
for
everyone
else
i
find
maple
a
bit
off
in
many
beers
but
they
normally
have
other
things
there
and
it
can
work
darn
well
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
it
went
down
a
treat
and
i
thionk
i
will
actively
seek
this
out
again
cheers
taste
imported
more
sweetness
but
not
to
a
large
or
disagreeable
level
smoothness
contributed
to
by
the
maple
im
sure
quite
enjoyable
even
to
a
hophead
exceeded
expectations
for
sure
mouthfeel
became
smoother
as
it
went
on
dark
reddish
orange
colour
slightly
hazy
little
head
doesnt
look
particularly
impressive
smell
is
lightly
roasted
malts
and
maple
syrup
taste
is
sweet
malts
and
definite
syrup
sweet
but
not
offensively
so
in
my
opinion
this
is
actually
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
lighter
and
flavourful
at
the
same
time
pleasantly
carbonated
a
decent
offering
from
a
brewery
i
generally
dont
care
for
i
reviewed
the
bigger
imperial
brother
of
this
ale
some
time
back
and
found
it
lackluster
it
seems
the
bigger
brew
loses
some
of
maple
sweetness
in
favor
of
alcohol
drinkability
definitely
has
drinkability
this
beer
not
only
tastes
good
but
goes
down
easy
as
well
beer
is
mildly
disappointing
price
point
on
this
beer
demands
for
me
at
least
that
their
beers
have
a
bigger
wow
factor
overall
this
is
a
present
beer
to
drink
complex
yet
subtle
i
would
love
to
revisit
this
one
as
my
pallet
matures
still
i
havent
met
a
brown
ale
that
can
surpass
samuel
smiths
nut
brown
ale
but
none
the
less
this
is
a
worthy
brew
d
good
to
take
with
yellow
cheese
and
salads
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
very
unique
flavor
the
nutty
chocolate
malt
flavor
was
very
strong
and
was
good
i
would
have
another
but
only
once
in
a
while
the
sweet
parade
continues
on
the
palate
as
maple
syrup
honey
and
chocolate
lead
the
way
with
nothing
to
impede
their
path
no
hops
no
yeast
no
alcohol
cloying
probably
drinkable
yes
depending
on
you
mood
i
much
prefer
the
imperial
version
but
this
one
is
plenty
interesting
in
its
own
right
try
it
when
the
sweet
tooth
needs
some
satisfaction
overall
it
went
down
ok
and
it
was
fairly
enjoyable
from
a
novelty
standpoint
ive
had
far
worse
browns
and
would
have
this
again
this
beer
is
a
tad
light
with
not
a
lot
of
body
there
is
a
strong
maple
flavor
and
that
toffee
keeps
coming
through
the
brown
malts
are
not
assertive
so
it
is
a
fairly
weak
beer
with
some
nutty
flavors
underneath
a
touch
of
spice
a
bit
drying
in
the
finish
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
the
beer
is
okay
its
enjoyable
its
light
but
it
isnt
brilliant
pours
a
thick
bodied
dark
opaque
brown
looks
kind
of
like
maple
syrup
thats
what
they
call
foreshadowing
smells
like
mrs
butterworths
there
are
some
other
nutty
malty
smells
bubbling
up
in
the
background
but
stickysweet
atificial
maple
syrup
taste
and
smell
overwhelms
everything
else
i
couldnt
swallow
the
first
sip
some
sweet
mapley
nutty
flavors
are
expected
in
a
nut
brown
ale
but
not
like
this
its
so
disgustingly
sweet
and
artificial
im
not
even
sure
if
im
drinking
beer
i
swear
it
is
brewed
with
high
fructose
corn
syrup
i
managed
to
get
down
about
half
the
bottle
but
no
more
the
thick
sweet
body
makes
this
undrinkable
avoid
d
could
kick
back
with
a
few
of
these
nothing
outstanding
but
fair
from
paltry
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
probably
not
even
my
fourth
choice
depending
on
circumstances
drinkability
session
beer
yes
my
kinda
of
session
beer
no
d
a
very
easy
drink
and
a
good
session
brew
overall
a
good
nut
brown
this
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
in
color
and
has
a
nutty
scent
beer
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
great
maply
syrup
flavor
mouthfeel
is
average
i
gave
this
a
3
5
on
the
drinkability
because
of
its
sweetness
and
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
pair
with
a
food
but
is
a
great
beer
all
by
its
self
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
drinkability
drinkability
is
pretty
good
d
good
i
finished
this
in
about
5
minutes
wouldnt
buy
it
though
3
5
truly
an
average
beer
poured
with
no
head
was
brown
and
slightly
hazy
mild
maple
taste
on
top
of
a
normal
nut
brown
flavor
even
as
the
beer
warmed
up
the
flavors
remained
truly
average
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
when
you
want
to
feel
absolutely
mediocre
all
and
all
not
bad
dark
mahogany
brown
bodied
very
small
tan
head
takes
off
quickly
very
rich
malt
scent
caramels
and
maple
with
hints
of
chocolate
nut
brown
flavors
dominate
the
taste
the
maple
is
blended
in
pretty
well
and
only
becomes
apparent
as
it
goes
down
im
not
a
major
brown
ale
guy
but
this
ones
pretty
tasty
pretty
wet
mouth
not
a
bad
beer
drinkability
not
bad
suprised
proably
woudnlt
buy
since
sweet
browns
are
not
my
thing
but
decent
note
when
this
beer
is
really
fresh
the
maple
notes
are
much
stronger
and
i
find
the
beer
to
be
less
sweet
too
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
to
try
it
in
idaho
springs
i
recommend
it
id
say
its
actually
quite
a
bit
better
but
i
havent
had
a
bottled
version
that
effectively
duplicates
that
its
still
no
world
beater
but
it
is
pretty
tasty
thanks
to
jdostal
for
the
sample
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
hazy
brownamber
color
with
a
1
finger
milk
chocolate
head
that
settled
into
a
slight
cap
with
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
nutty
goodness
some
light
chocolate
and
maybe
some
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
roasted
malts
and
nice
nutty
flavor
there
is
also
a
great
hop
balance
to
this
brew
i
am
not
getting
the
sweet
maple
taste
that
is
advertised
but
this
is
still
a
very
good
brew
d
not
terribly
complex
but
not
bad
d
though
never
really
a
fan
of
nut
browns
this
one
got
a
slight
bonus
for
the
uniqueness
of
the
cracker
jack
taste
actually
took
me
back
a
bit
outside
of
that
its
pretty
average
all
around
good
full
mouthfeel
to
go
with
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
down
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
down
several
pints
pretty
nice
d
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
maybe
a
tad
sweet
for
my
liking
but
the
low
abv
certainly
makes
it
sessionable
if
you
dont
mind
a
sweet
malty
brew
it
went
down
pretty
quickly
as
i
reviewed
it
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
nutty
for
me
i
appreciate
the
interesting
combination
of
flavors
but
this
isnt
something
ill
likely
try
again
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
nuts
and
maple
taste
is
good
nuts
maple
a
tad
sweet
very
flavorful
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
worth
checking
out
a
solid
beer
overall
overall
a
new
favourite
d
this
one
is
decent
for
having
a
few
of
but
the
bitterness
seems
to
be
a
bit
off
balance
it
is
not
hugely
noticeable
though
d
amazing
if
you
like
nuts
not
really
a
beer
i
would
look
forward
too
trying
again
d
very
easy
drinking
although
its
feels
a
little
thin
and
isnt
the
most
complex
beer
a
pretty
solid
everyday
beer
though
medium
body
well
carbonated
this
has
a
real
smooth
mouthfeel
definitely
drinkable
at
4
5
theres
nothing
spectacular
about
this
beer
but
its
pleasing
in
all
aspects
i
could
put
back
a
sixer
of
these
on
an
evening
browns
are
a
nice
and
easy
to
drink
beer
year
round
and
this
fits
the
bill
the
maple
adds
a
bit
of
character
to
it
nicely
done
value
bought
individually
for
2
a
pop
next
time
ill
go
with
the
six
pack
poured
dark
brown
into
an
american
pint
glass
with
less
than
a
finger
of
tan
head
and
spotty
lacing
the
smell
was
dominated
by
nuttiness
along
with
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
not
much
of
a
hint
of
maple
in
the
smell
not
much
of
maple
syrup
flavor
in
the
taste
either
which
was
a
nice
blend
of
nuts
chocolate
and
maltiness
but
finishing
on
a
supersweet
note
however
maple
syrup
texture
certainly
surfaced
in
the
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
a
nice
sipping
beer
maybe
with
dessert
but
not
a
session
brew
for
me
all
in
all
a
good
job
pours
an
ambercopper
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
into
nothing
little
lacing
nose
is
sweet
with
malt
maple
nut
slightly
toasty
taste
is
very
sweet
maple
nut
toasty
reminds
me
a
bit
of
sweet
tea
actually
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
seems
a
bit
thinner
than
it
should
be
but
silky
smooth
quite
drinkable
overall
a
very
sweet
brew
with
no
bitterness
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
see
no
reason
to
not
be
able
to
drink
these
all
evening
if
you
dig
scotch
ales
this
is
in
the
same
ballpark
just
on
the
mild
side
overall
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
a
nut
brown
with
the
sweet
maple
adding
a
different
element
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
whos
looking
for
a
nut
brown
thats
slightly
less
nutty
drinkability
this
one
is
a
favorite
of
mine
and
a
guilty
pleasure
beer
i
love
how
the
maple
just
pops
it
is
sweet
but
still
has
the
nut
brown
taste
i
could
session
this
one
overall
this
beer
wasnt
horrible
but
imho
its
an
average
beer
its
a
pretty
medium
brown
beer
with
a
small
amount
of
tan
head
low
carbonation
the
aroma
is
slightly
nutty
with
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
bit
nutty
at
first
then
the
maple
kicks
in
after
a
few
seconds
the
maple
is
not
overpowering
its
very
nice
the
finish
is
very
smooth
the
body
was
about
perfect
for
a
brown
this
is
definitely
a
repeat
buy
there
was
really
no
body
whatsoever
underpowered
in
every
way
however
there
was
plenty
of
bitecarbonation
ruling
out
what
i
thought
could
be
a
tainted
beer
but
part
of
me
just
thinks
this
one
was
supposed
to
be
a
little
better
than
this
this
is
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
it
has
the
characteristics
of
a
good
nut
brown
but
maybe
tries
to
go
too
far
by
adding
the
maple
syrup
it
tastes
too
much
like
syrup
and
not
enough
of
the
brown
malty
flavor
comes
through
lightmedium
bodied
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
havnt
too
many
eyeopening
nut
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
interesting
i
love
the
maple
syrup
they
add
and
the
fact
that
its
not
overwhelming
or
too
faint
kinda
expensive
but
i
liked
this
one
d
just
cant
do
it
this
may
end
up
in
the
drain
it
is
a
good
solid
tasting
beer
but
even
on
a
cool
spring
night
you
wouldnt
probably
drink
more
than
2
of
these
the
flavor
of
maple
and
caramel
is
nice
at
first
but
you
get
tired
of
it
by
the
end
of
the
glass
and
are
looking
for
something
a
bit
different
this
one
depends
on
the
individuals
tolerance
for
sweetness
but
is
pretty
good
youll
find
nut
browns
with
better
balance
etc
but
this
one
deserves
a
chance
as
well
my
wife
just
brought
me
this
beer
in
a
pint
glass
theres
no
head
at
all
but
perhaps
i
should
blame
her
for
that
she
was
nice
enough
to
buy
it
at
kroger
for
me
when
i
asked
her
to
get
me
something
other
than
miller
lite
other
than
the
lack
of
head
its
dark
ruby
brown
and
hard
to
see
through
smells
sweet
and
malty
like
maple
syrup
and
plums
tastes
much
the
same
way
it
smells
malty
maple
sweet
and
no
bitterness
im
used
to
ales
having
some
hoppy
charachteristics
but
there
are
none
with
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
heavier
than
water
with
little
carbonation
a
little
creamy
maybe
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
too
many
of
these
in
any
quantity
ok
beer
nothing
great
d
my
goal
is
to
finish
just
this
first
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brownish
amber
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
toffee
and
is
rather
simple
the
taste
is
a
lot
more
prominent
than
the
aroma
there
is
a
nice
balance
between
the
maple
flavor
and
the
malty
toffee
and
caramel
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
for
the
style
and
the
texture
is
watery
overall
this
beer
is
very
odd
in
that
is
has
some
aspects
that
are
very
good
and
others
that
are
very
poor
i
wish
it
had
some
maple
in
the
nose
and
fuller
body
as
is
though
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
it
again
d
although
the
taste
is
not
the
best
these
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
medium
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
light
tan
foam
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
and
tastes
of
light
roasted
grains
brown
sugar
nuts
such
as
pecans
and
hazelnuts
maple
syrup
a
hint
of
bitter
coffee
and
chocolate
malt
this
brown
ale
is
medium
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
decent
stuff
i
have
5
more
to
drink
and
i
know
ill
get
through
it
but
this
beer
tastes
too
much
like
maple
for
me
to
buy
a
6pk
of
again
if
i
want
this
much
maple
syrup
ill
call
aunt
jamima
or
go
to
ihop
its
just
that
strong
a
maple
taste
ymmv
a
bit
more
drinkable
as
it
warms
but
not
much
a
thin
brew
without
much
character
quite
disappointing
taste
is
a
very
weak
brown
ale
with
slight
carbonation
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
at
all
tommyknocker
beers
just
dont
do
it
for
me
ive
yet
to
be
even
mildly
impressed
with
one
ill
just
chalk
it
up
to
not
being
for
me
this
was
the
last
beer
i
had
from
the
tommyknocker
variety
sixer
three
of
the
six
were
great
beers
glad
to
have
tried
these
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
some
lighter
amber
hues
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
strongly
of
roasted
malt
up
front
even
strong
hints
of
coffee
and
some
slight
cream
sweetness
fits
the
style
of
an
american
brown
ale
mouth
feel
is
really
smooth
and
slightly
chewy
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
very
sweet
first
then
the
roasted
malts
come
through
then
some
coffee
notes
and
some
sweet
malt
decent
hop
background
and
it
finishes
with
a
blend
of
flavors
that
is
really
pleasing
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
full
of
flavors
and
really
easy
to
drink
cant
understand
why
its
rated
so
low
pours
a
dark
brown
caramely
colored
body
with
a
creamy
nearlywhite
head
lasting
very
malty
aroma
some
dust
some
dark
sugar
maple
id
say
dusty
watery
taste
some
maple
a
little
nuttiness
weak
almost
headache
inducing
d
sweet
and
tasty
easy
to
drink
i
havent
had
this
beer
in
sometime
and
i
dont
know
why
i
stopped
getting
it
very
good
d
light
and
sweet
without
diminishing
in
drinkability
overall
impression
a
mostly
forgettable
american
brown
very
middle
of
the
road
nothing
exciting
but
not
terrible
overall
it
seems
i
might
have
a
higher
opinion
of
this
brew
than
most
i
went
into
this
expecting
to
be
inundated
with
maple
but
its
really
quite
subtle
i
recommend
giving
it
a
try
overall
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
a
great
session
beer
but
i
would
rather
have
something
more
complex
or
hoppy
clear
dark
brown
body
in
certain
angles
it
looks
like
a
dark
amber
pours
a
nice
off
white
head
smells
like
a
malt
lovers
dream
very
rich
and
sweet
smelling
not
much
for
hop
aroma
though
wow
taste
is
very
very
ballanced
the
front
is
sweet
and
malty
toasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
maple
sugar
i
think
i
can
taste
more
maple
in
the
after
taste
as
well
little
to
no
hops
are
detectable
making
this
beer
extremely
smooth
and
balances
dangerously
good
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
refreshing
this
could
actually
get
the
job
done
on
a
hot
day
and
drinkability
is
very
good
due
to
a
lack
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
all
that
sugary
flavor
up
front
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
had
this
at
the
super
bowl
party
and
thought
it
was
pretty
interesting
poured
a
dark
chestnut
with
just
a
little
tan
head
aromas
were
very
subdued
i
was
expecting
a
maple
blast
but
the
taste
was
great
a
big
nuttiness
right
up
front
the
maple
became
more
evident
on
the
palate
as
the
beer
warmed
but
was
always
more
noticeable
on
the
finish
medium
body
was
fine
not
a
session
beer
by
my
standard
but
a
fun
beer
to
try
nikki
try
this
beer
if
you
like
a
full
bodied
somewhat
sweet
but
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
was
excellent
i
kept
thinking
to
myself
this
beer
isnt
even
that
good
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
had
polished
off
the
bottle
without
knowing
it
that
light
flavor
contributes
to
the
huge
drinkability
ill
definitely
pick
up
some
more
bottles
of
this
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
mapleflavored
good
drinkability
d
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
probably
not
a
great
session
beer
in
my
opinion
but
not
a
bad
beer
overall
a
lot
better
than
i
expected
maple
syrup
is
a
nice
addition
to
a
traditional
brown
ale
pretty
decent
for
a
tommyknocker
brew
worth
having
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
not
the
sryupy
maple
infused
beer
i
was
hoping
for
d
i
could
drink
a
few
d
a
little
mild
on
the
flavor
but
not
mild
enough
to
put
me
off
a
second
one
drinkability
is
not
very
high
in
my
book
as
the
flavor
is
on
the
mellow
side
and
not
satisfying
enough
to
go
back
for
more
appearance
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
hues
absent
of
a
head
the
smell
is
malty
nutty
a
hint
of
yeast
absent
of
hops
but
a
note
of
maple
the
taste
is
thin
watery
no
body
the
maple
flavor
come
out
in
the
finish
would
be
a
great
beer
if
it
had
more
of
a
malt
backbone
d
very
drinkable
if
i
had
to
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
however
prefer
more
flavorable
beers
d
this
beer
struck
me
as
sort
of
a
onetrick
pony
the
maple
theme
is
pushed
to
the
extent
that
it
overwhelms
anything
else
that
night
be
going
on
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
im
anxious
to
revisit
overall
an
ok
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
if
had
limited
options
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
more
d
a
decent
brew
but
there
are
better
tommyknocker
beers
and
much
better
more
interesting
brown
ales
out
there
drinkability
although
it
is
too
sweet
for
my
tastebuds
and
lacks
any
balancing
complexity
it
is
not
unpleasant
to
drink
and
should
appeal
to
those
who
may
like
a
sweet
malty
and
slightly
offkilter
brew
oy
this
is
a
sorry
excuse
for
a
brown
ale
actually
this
is
a
sorry
beer
period
i
look
at
my
numbers
and
i
feel
im
being
a
tad
generous
to
the
rating
but
ill
leave
them
be
redeeming
qualities
are
in
very
short
supply
real
quick
slight
maple
aroma
nothing
else
good
initial
pour
soon
becomes
flat
and
thin
mouthfeel
is
awkward
and
light
flavor
is
so
freaking
weak
and
bland
overall
a
major
bummer
back
in
97
i
took
my
first
road
trip
out
west
we
drove
through
idaho
springs
and
boy
am
i
glad
we
didnt
stop
if
this
is
what
passes
for
beer
in
that
little
mountain
town
later
gnomes
drinkability
very
drinkable
would
enjoy
it
again
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
not
a
big
beer
but
good
when
out
or
with
a
meal
if
youre
looking
for
a
great
brown
ale
try
the
rogue
hazelnut
brown
nectar
itll
knock
your
socks
off
wheres
the
maple
just
a
standard
brown
ale
here
nothing
too
spectacular
about
it
the
label
says
theres
a
maple
taste
as
does
the
name
but
i
cant
taste
it
one
bit
at
least
that
would
have
made
this
one
unique
i
would
drink
this
again
if
handed
to
me
but
if
i
had
a
choice
in
a
beer
store
for
a
six
pack
this
one
wouldnt
be
very
high
drinkability
decent
malt
profile
and
the
addition
of
maple
syrup
does
its
best
to
try
and
spruce
up
the
standard
brown
ale
a
beer
many
find
outright
boring
a
decent
brownish
color
with
reddish
tints
and
a
onefinger
head
that
died
quickly
but
left
some
lace
has
a
faint
malt
smell
with
some
roasted
malts
and
maybe
a
hint
of
coffeenut
light
to
medium
bodied
and
a
tad
syrupy
has
a
semislick
malt
feel
to
it
there
are
some
noticeable
sweet
malts
in
here
and
faint
hop
presence
but
this
is
pretty
much
a
generic
brown
ale
that
isnt
worth
pursuing
this
was
a
decent
american
brown
ale
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
although
it
has
an
interesting
flavor
and
is
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
another
tommyknocker
that
fails
to
impress
looks
good
but
quickly
takes
a
nose
dive
cheap
sweet
corn
syrupy
maple
syrup
flavor
just
doesnt
win
me
over
sorry
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
session
beer
rather
lack
luster
brown
ale
poured
quickly
from
the
bottle
and
i
had
to
wonder
for
a
second
if
this
beer
was
completely
flat
smell
vaguely
like
maple
syrup
which
i
was
expecting
from
the
name
of
the
beer
if
not
on
the
label
i
dont
know
if
i
would
have
been
able
to
pick
it
out
tastes
like
a
really
watered
down
brown
ale
with
not
much
aftertaste
over
all
a
very
dissappointing
ale
as
i
have
been
looking
for
a
new
brown
ale
to
have
with
cooler
weather
coming
no
syrup
in
the
feel
though
which
is
on
the
watery
side
of
mediumbodied
and
somewhat
juicy
otherwise
nicely
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
note
pronounced
twanginess
in
a
brown
ale
isnt
standard
this
may
have
been
a
defective
keg
will
taste
and
score
if
seen
again
elsewhere
i
was
a
tad
disappointed
here
the
bland
mouthfeel
and
flavor
were
what
killed
me
combined
with
the
decided
maple
punch
i
was
thirsting
for
again
there
may
have
been
factors
at
play
here
which
turned
the
beer
but
nevertheless
one
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
for
someone
like
me
this
beer
isnt
bad
at
all
however
from
an
objective
standpoint
there
is
way
too
much
maple
syrup
in
this
beer
and
not
enough
malts
to
balance
its
pedestrian
at
best
i
could
have
a
couple
because
i
like
maple
syrup
but
im
sure
it
would
get
old
after
a
little
while
while
i
dont
doubt
the
pure
maple
syrup
on
the
label
the
taste
is
more
of
molasses
thick
and
sugary
with
the
malty
backbone
of
the
nut
brown
for
me
very
cloying
and
overlysweet
that
builds
the
maple
doesnt
blend
well
with
the
base
beer
either
with
a
light
watery
mouthfeel
sounds
good
on
the
surface
but
not
much
to
dig
down
into
drinkability
i
remembered
this
one
being
better
in
the
past
perhaps
this
trail
mix
6pack
had
been
sitting
for
a
while
but
nothing
has
been
stellar
for
sure
purchased
as
part
of

local
grocer
small

on
a
dark
amber

gone

light

matched
with
maple
taste
is
about
the
same

a
coffeecaramel
finish
low
fizz
not
bad
but
not
great
pretty
good
brew
nothing
earth
shattering
though
d
easy
to
put
these
down
but
it
could
get
quite
dull
after
3
or
4
this
is
for
coors
light
drinkers
looking
to
try
another
form
watered
down
alcohol
m
d
carbonation
was
very
mild
smooth
and
easy
drinking
ale
but
i
found
this
to
be
very
average
nothing
special
about
this
to
distinguish
it
from
other
browns
this
is
the
fourth
or
fifth
beer
ive
sampled
from
this
brewer
and
i
ve
been
mostly
unimpressed
pours
a
three
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
clear
mahogany
color
good
carbonation

thin

taste
matches
the
smell
with
just
some
faint
nutty
flavors
overall
very
bland
mouth
is
thin
and
gives
a
powdered
malt
homebrew
impression
this
one
starts
out
looking
ok
but
goes
downhill
from
there
nothing
to
make
me
come
back
and
try
this
one
again
to
sweet
for
meneeds
more
balancing
to
it
i
wont
be
buying
this
beer
again
overall
this
isnt
a
beer
that
i
can
see
myself
buying
again
d
a
very
filling
and
enjoyable
beer
nothing
special
but
definately
worth
trying
dark
brown
pour
with
a
pale
creamy
head
weak
but
fresh
smell
taste
is
unique
to
be
sure
lots
of
nuttiness
a
hint
of
maple
and
i
think
i
tasted
barbecue
sauce
mouthfeel
is
decent
if
not
a
bit
too
carbonated
drinkability
also
a
little
better
than
average
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
poor
tan
head
the
nose
has
some
mild
malts
and
is
quite
light
the
taste
is
marginally
improved
with
a
faint
nuttiness
and
bitter
hop
presence
really
not
too
much
going
on
here
light
body
and
heavy
carbonation
very
mild
even
for
a
brown
d
pretty
drinkable
for
an
english
brown
ale
wow
very
watery
the
dullest
most
boring
beer
in
the
history
of
ales
at
least
theres
no
aftertaste
hell
at
least
theres
no
aftertaste
but
u
need
taste
to
get
an
aftertaste
one
of
the
shadiest
brown
ales
around
more
disappointing
than
constipation
d
my
complaints
dont
really
detract
from
the
drinkability
here
you
could
put
away
23
and
it
would
probably
go
great
with
a
glazed
chicken
or
pork
dish
among
other
foods
light
in
body
low
carbonation
and
incredibly
smooth
goes
down
very
easily
a
real
session
beer
that
has
just
enough
to
keep
you
interested
not
a
bad
choice
for
gameday
the
taste
is
slightly
nutty
very
sweet
and
caramellike
on
top
of
this
there
are
bits
of
maple
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
with
a
little
touch
of
hops
in
the
finish
theres
moderate
carbonation
a
plain
body
kind
of
watery
there
are
no
major
turn
offs
here
good
taste
this
a
good
session
beer
if
nothing
else
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
from
its
light
sweet
flavor
but
i
didnt
really
care
too
much
for
its
visual
aspects
and
the
fizziness
really
was
a
drawback
making
it
just
average
when
all
considered
d
this
is
a
really
nice
brown
ale
with
a
unique
twist
its
slightly
sweeter
and
less
dry
than
most
browns
but
its
a
nice
mellow
sipper
that
could
be
a
great
autumn
session
brew
this
poured
a
hazy
medium
brown
with
a
little
tan
head
it
smelled
almost
exactly
like
hard
apple
cider
with
a
bit
of
hops
it
tasted
mostly
like
apple
cider
with
some
citrus
hops
added
in
but
there
was
no
noticeable
maple
or
nut
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
good
clean
drink
but
not
at
all
what
i
expected
nice
deep
dark
brown
color
one
finger
head
with
minimal
lacing
not
a
whole
lot
of
action
in
the
way
of
carbonation
resulting
in
a
flat
mouth
feel
taste
is
okay
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
maple
but
overall
unimpressive
so
far
the
pick
axe
ale
is
my
favorite
for
tommyknocker
nutty
brownish
amber
type
thing
with
a
thin
slightly
darker
than
offwhite
head
aromas
of
slightly
roasty
malt
macadamia
nuts
and
maple
the
flavor
was
pretty
bland
a
little
nutty
roasty
malt
with
a
very
elusive
maple
character
kinda
slippery
on
the
tongue
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
i
would
rename
this
one
college
town
brown
this
was
a
wierd
beer
often
times
the
scent
is
a
large
indicator
of
taste
this
was
not
one
of
those
times
the
appearance
was
pretty
bland
same
color
as
maple
syrup
but
not
quite
as
thick
smell
is
sweet
like
candy
taste
is
rather
dry
i
dont
get
it
drinkable
beer
but
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
medium
body
with
some
airiness
for
being
such
a
flatseeming
beer
really
about
what
anybody
i
think
should
expect
from
a
maple
nut
brown
ale
poured
a
dark
brown
to
dark
copper
color
there
is
little
to
no
head
i
was
kinda
excited
about
this
beer
and
so
far
so
good
the
aroma
is
sweet
scent
of
roaster
nuts
as
well
as
chocolate
very
sweet
and
very
malty
as
expected
the
flavor
didnt
give
me
what
i
was
looking
for
maybe
thats
my
fault
too
little
of
everything
i
expected
powerful
malts
roasted
nuts
and
nice
chocolate
taste
i
got
a
little
roasted
malts
and
a
little
hint
of
others
the
finish
is
plain
and
boring
d
this
was
my
first
from
tommyknocker
it
was
good
but
nothing
too
impressive
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
butthead
and
pick
axe
taste
was
nutty
and
sweet
very
light
hop
bitterness
not
really
much
going
on
with
this
beer
pretty
plain
dark
yet
transluscent
maroon
colored
pour
with
a
light
beige
head
oddly
sweet
maple
smell
with
a
light
sour
vinegar
smell
not
good
taste
is
basically
nutty
light
smooth
and
boring
i
bought
3
other
beers
from
this
brewery
and
i
hope
this
isnt
their
best
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
and
was
drawn
in
from
the
bottle
but
it
really
wasnt
good
didnt
finish
and
wouldnt
get
again
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
pretty
solid
nut
brown
with
some
good
flavor
and
sweetness
to
it
overall
decent
nothing
special
though
i
liked
it
enough
but
there
are
much
better
brown
ales
to
be
had
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
like
the
one
i
had
but
this
beer
is
just
not
a
wow
beer
would
i
buy
another
maybe
i
probably
would
try
this
on
tap
but
a
whole
six
pack
im
not
so
sure
imo
this
beer
is
a
novelty
if
i
want
a
brown
ale
i¬íll
drink
moose
drool
if
i
want
a
maple
brown
something
i
am
going
straight
for
the
tk
imperial
nut
brown
while
this
standard
version
is
good
it
isn¬ít
special
enough
or
frankly
rich
enough
for
me
to
want
to
drink
again
would
i
turn
down
a
free
pint
no
would
i
buy
one
maybe
will
i
seek
this
out
no
purchased
in
omaha
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
deep
brown
with
a
slight
amber
hue
and
a
thin
creamy
offwhite
cap
the
smell
is
underwhelming
maple
syrup
not
really
apparent
but
it
is
malty
sweet
a
bit
nutty
and
slightly
roasted
the
taste
is
much
the
same
tastes
like
a
nut
brown
ale
starts
with
a
malty
nutty
presence
and
finishes
with
an
off
taste
that
isnt
very
enjoyable
there
is
also
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
had
expected
maybe
a
mediumlight
body
with
a
decent
carbonation
a
drinkable
beer
but
this
one
falls
short
of
my
expectations
overall
i
liked
the
beer
but
it
was
more
of
a
drinking
beer
as
opposed
to
a
tasting
beer
if
that
makes
any
sense
d
good
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
oelergud
d
seemed
a
little
too
sweet
but
thats
prolly
just
my
taste
in
beer
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
overall
i
thought
this
would
be
nice
as
i
am
a
fan
of
the
brown
ale
and
sweetness
has
never
seemed
to
bother
me
however
they
were
just
used
in
the
wrong
proportions
here
way
overboard
on
the
sweetness
it
just
really
became
kind
of
messy
i
will
not
be
pursuing
this
one
again
d
overall
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
out
all
the
time
but
it
was
good
for
a
pint
and
id
have
some
again
i
didnt
really
care
for
tks
brews
when
i
was
in
idaho
springs
and
as
i
work
my
way
through
this
6er
im
already
being
reminded
of
why
watery
soapy
wierd
offflavors
this
one
should
be
passed
upon
ugh
a
bland
and
mild
english
brown
whose
flavor
seems
to
have
no
direction
not
worth
sampling
overall
a
good
drinkable
brown
ale
it
isnt
as
flavorful
as
some
on
the
market
but
its
a
great
beer
on
an
early
fall
night
when
youre
looking
at
drinking
more
than
one
id
drink
it
again
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
bottling
info
on
back
label
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
deep
brownish
amber
color
it
had
a
good
head
that
settled
to
a
thin
coating
with
some
lacing
the
aroma
was
toasted
malt
with
maple
overtones
the
taste
was
good
malty
backbone
with
a
sweet
finish
unlike
the
honey
flavored
beers
this
maple
one
gets
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
with
being
too
cloying
ive
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
its
a
little
better
on
tap
but
still
good
in
the
bottle
overall
its
a
good
but
not
great
beer
and
i
enjoy
it
as
a
good
changeup
session
beer
glad
to
see
them
back
in
texas
after
leaving
due
to
distributor
issues
3

or
t
y
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
aromas
that
consist
of
maple
syrup
and
brown
sugar
in
the
taste
sweet
and
a
dry
maple
syrup
flavor
a
smooth
dry
mouthfeel
with
a
sweet
sticky
maple
syrup
aftertaste
sweet
and
dry
in
all
the
right
places
easy
to
drink
and
better
as
it
warms
up
poured
a
dark
and
slightly
hazy
brown
with
a
big
head
that
faded
fairly
quickly
leaving
some
descent
lacing
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
wow
not
for
me
take
this
one
with
a
grain
of
salt
maybe
it
went
bad
it
is
4
months
past
due
the
mouth
on
this
one
isnt
sweet
at
all
instead
its
a
biting
sharp
astringent
sting
in
other
words
its
a
pour
i
would
have
thought
that
would
have
shown
in
the
nose
this
beer
started
off
better
then
it
ended
everything
to
the
eye
looked
good
dark
brown
color
like
the
color
of
wood
the
smell
was
not
bad
it
had
a
sweet
honey
smell
and
kind
of
a
caramel
burnt
sugar
smell
it
tastes
very
malty
and
thick
like
molasses
its
not
to
bad
up
front
but
the
sugar
just
becomes
to
much
after
a
few
drinks
i
might
have
to
check
my
self
for
diabetes
after
this
the
maple
and
nut
brown
flavors
are
all
there
but
they
taste
too
sweet
and
artificial
to
me
not
a
huge
fan
but
it
might
be
a
good
beginner
beer
tried
this
ontap
at
bodega
in
columbus
ohio
poured
reddish
maple
syrup
color
with
a
thin
white
head
not
a
lot
of
retention
smells
and
tastes
were
a
little
weak
but
appropriate
for
a
brown
ale
nuts
maple
syrup
bit
of
lightly
toasted
grained
not
much
of
a
finish
a
little
watery
on
the
mouthfeel
overall
an
easily
drinkable
session
beer
not
a
whole
lot
of
astonishing
character
but
pleasant
to
drink
nonetheless
this
was
a
strange
brew
that
oddly
enough
reminded
me
of
grape
soda
drinkability
pretty
good
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
occasional
drinking
but
nothing
spectacular
the
look
is
the
best
part
of
this
beernice
long
lasting
head
with
good
lace
the
color
is
a
slightly
murky
light
brown
notched

best
by
4
months
after
aroma
is
sweetmalty
with
interesting
smoky
notes
fairly
sweet
malt
up
front
with
a
mild
hint
of
maple
carrying
through
to
a
restrained
hoppy
finish
the
somewhat
syrupy
mouthfeel
actually
goes
well
with
the
flavor
and
style
not
a
bad
brown
ale
the
smokiness
and
maple
make
it
pretty
interesting
however
a
bit
too
sweet
to
want
to
drink
too
many
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
sour
disappointing
okay
beer
i
can¬ít
decide
whether
i
really
taste
the
maple
or
am
just
imagining
it
the
nutty
malt
and
caramelhoney
sweetness
could
resemble
maple
either
way
to
my
taste
it¬ís
an
okay
beer
at
best
not
bad
overall
the
best
of
the
mixed
sixer
i
have
had
this
is
the
fourth
so
this
one
is
worthy
of
consumption
give
it
a
shot
d
fair
this
would
be
a
good
sessioner
for
the
late
fall
months
maybe
ill
come
back
then
and
give
it
another
try
not
my
favorite
style
but
generally
wellcrafted
wheres
the
maple
though
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
brownish
color
with
fluffy
head
that
does
leave
a
ring
while
drinking
smell
is
of
fig
and
some
bitterness
as
well
also
some
sweet
honey
nectar
in
there
taste
is
pretty
sour
for
my
liking
not
much
carbonation
just
sourness
it
taste
like
some
lemon
squeezed
into
a
beer
its
actually
tangy
and
tarty
not
what
i
was
expecting
this
was
my
first
beer
from
tommyknocker
it
was
a
bit
unusual
worth
a
shot
eric
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
balance
is
ok
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
too
much
but
i
would
prefer
the
sour
component
to
be
more
subtle
decent
drinkability
as
you
could
easily
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
brought
this
one
home
about
a
year
ago
serving
it
room
temperature
now
light
tan
head
that
quicly
yields
to
a
light
broken
cover
with
almost
no
lace
brown
color
with
some
copper
red
highlights
nose
is
of
bread
maple
nuts
caramel
and
malt
taste
is
the
same
but
less
so
body
is
a
yawner
when
ive
had
this
before
it
was
a
lot
better
so
maybe
its
the
age
the
mouth
could
use
a
bit
of
bulkingup
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
i¬ím
always
surprised
more
brewers
don¬ít
experiment
with
maple
syrup
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
point
maple
from
stevens
point
brewery
that
was
out
in
the
mid
1990s
style
of
beer
founds
this
while
in
chicago
for
the
day
pours
a
dark
brown
color
and
is
opaque
has
a
nice
head
that
things
out
a
little
smells
nutty
and
slightly
sweet
seems
a
little
resiny
too
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
moderately
carbonated
its
a
little
dry
and
tastes
a
little
like
bourbon
but
a
little
watery
malts
are
moderate
but
the
hops
are
light
this
was
a
decent
and
i
probably
pick
this
up
again
if
i
find
it
it
is
hard
to
tell
what
this
beer
looks
like
what
with
i
was
drinking
it
out
of
a
brown
bottle
however
it
does
have
an
interesting
smell
more
like
maple
syrup
than
beer
fortunately
the
maple
flavor
does
not
overwhelm
the
ale
taste
in
fact
there
is
just
a
whisper
of
maple
the
ale
flavor
is
strong
and
without
bitterness
and
it
feels
very
smooth
not
outstanding
but
very
drinkable
wow
tommyknocker
seems
to
believe
in
order
to
make
beer
you
have
to
add
more
sugar
than
hops
it
tasted
way
too
sweet
from
start
to
finish
had
no
bitterness
smelled
very
mapley
had
very
fine
carbonation
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
which
was
good
poured
dark
brown
almost
opaque
which
was
good
but
the
important
part
taste
fell
way
short
drinkability
great
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
i
could
find
my
self
enjoying
a
few
of
these
in
the
pub
the
pour
into
my
fullers
nonic
raises
a
forgettable
head
even
after
a
hard
pour
at
the
end
its
less
than
a
half
finger
light
tan
and
falls
exceedingly
quickly
the
body
though
is
a
beautiful
transparent
deep
garnet
the
nose
has
a
discernible
sweetness
that
might
be
maple
but
it
could
be
simply
because
of
the
label
theres
a
slight
bit
of
nuttiness
and
breadiness
but
the
aroma
is
on
the
whole
far
too
light
the
first
thing
i
notice
in
the
taste
is
a
definite
light
maple
taste
with
nuttiness
and
sweet
toasted
malt
flavors
theres
a
great
malt
aftertaste
too
they
definitely
didnt
use
much
maple
but
this
could
be
a
very
nice
session
beer
with
enough
comfortable
flavor
to
be
interesting
but
not
too
much
to
hinder
quaffing
the
mouth
is
light
perhaps
a
bit
much
but
the
carbonation
is
spoton
present
but
not
too
tingly
id
buy
this
again
and
would
also
love
to
have
it
by
the
pitcher
at
a
pub
well
upon
first
drink
i
thought
hell
this
aint
that
bad
but
on
the
second
drink
i
wonder
why
i
bought
this
brew
on
draught
overly
maple
syrupy
thick
palate
coating
and
very
cloying
sweetness
slight
nut
flavors
but
everything
is
just
overpowered
by
the
maple
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
almost
no
head
that
quickly
dissolved
into
a
collar
aroma
was
very
malty
with
undertones
of
maple
and
brown
sugar
initial
was
somewhat
strong
on
the
maple
syrup
it
was
more
under
toned
in
the
aftertaste
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
by
far
but
brown
ales
are
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
for
a
brown
ale
this
is
drinkable
pours
a
hazy
chestnut
color
with
some
golden
hues
and
a
very
nice
cream
colored
head
with
decent
retention
aroma
is
of
toasted
and
nutty
malt
while
the
bottle
states
maple
syrup
is
added
it
is
barely
noticeable
if
at
all
taste
is
a
of
toasted
malt
and
perhaps
a
faint
maple
finish
taste
is
also
slightly
metallic
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
would
prefer
but
not
bad
drinkability
is
ok
i
dont
really
care
for
another
though

a
medium
to
dark
brown
with
a
nice
two
finger
tan
head
that
holds
well
and
a
good
lacing
to
the
finish
faint
smells
of
maple
and
nuts
and
toasted
malt
really
liked
the
added
maple
syrup
but
thought
it
was
a
little
weak
but
a
very
nice
combination
with
the
nut
and
toasted
malt
flaver
mouthfeel
very
smooth
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
cant
wait
to
get
more
i
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
great
beer
store
in
boulder
while
heading
back
home
from
the
gabf
in
september
the
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
thick
body
with
long
streams
of
carbonation
running
quickly
from
the
bottom
to
form
a
nice
foamy
head
with
thick
bubbles
the
aroma
of
this
one
was
sweet
probably
from
the
maple
syrupness
to
this
one
nutting
the
taste
was
not
overly
complex
and
not
as
mapley
or
nutty
as
the
name
would
suggest
there
were
notes
of
maple
and
some
nutty
tones
but
overall
this
was
a
fairly
light
beer
although
i
am
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
drinkability
not
as
drinkable
as
you
would
want
in
a
brown
ale
too
sweet
and
sugary
for
that
the
taste
as
noted
above
was
overly
tarty
and
light
springy
on
the
palate
light
carbonation
as
well
the
chocolate
and
maple
notes
as
indicated
on
the
bottle
have
all
but
been
lost
due
to
time
on
the
shelf
id
give
this
beer
another
try
but
ill
definately
look
to
see
how
old
the
beer
is
pours
a
slightly
murky
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
displays
a
nice
toasted
maltiness
with
some
caramel
and
a
sweet
maple
nutty
smell
the
taste
is
very
smooth
bodied
with
a
nutty
toasted
maltiness
and
some
caramel
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
overall
despite
not
being
the
most
complex
brew
around
it
is
a
highly
drinkable
brown
ale
that
is
very
solid
i
didnt
find
this
extremely
drinkable
for
a
beer
it
reminded
me
of
a
muted
and
watery
woodchuck
cider
nothing
really
negative
just
not
very
quenching
drinkability
i
enjoy
sweet
beers
but
this
one
pushes
me
too
much
past
the
limit
i
had
this
brewers
imperial
maple
nut
brown
ale
some
time
back
i
absolutely
loved
it
my
hunch
was
that
this
would
be
similar
but
with
lower
alcohol
and
less
intense
flavor
this
proved
to
be
the
case
but
the
heavy
sweetness
was
something
i
hadnt
counted
on
probably
wont
try
again
tastes
very
much
like
smells
big
kick
of
very
sweet
syrup
at
the
start
followed
up
quickly
by
a
lingering
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
pretty
good
even
if
its
nothing
special
d
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
taste
so
much
so
not
extremely
drinkable
the
drinkability
suffers
from
the
excess
sweetness
mk
d¬ónot
bad
but
a
little
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
thanks
to
buckeyenation
for
this
one
yum
if
you
love
sweet
maple
syrup
youll
love
this
beer
it
had
a
smooth
maple
goodness
that
wasnt
too
rich
its
smell
reminded
me
of
when
i
used
to
sit
under
maple
trees
when
i
lived
in
chicago
even
its
milk
chocolate
brown
color
made
me
want
to
have
this
beer
with
a
warm
short
stack
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
minimal
14
beige
head
above
the
slightly
cloudy
red
brew
head
is
quickly
down
to
a
swirly
layer
of
teensy
bubbles
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
deeply
of
grains
which
i
like
taste
continues
the
maltiness
from
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
light
fruitiness
buried
in
there
and
a
slight
chalky
close
mouthfeel
is
smooth
almost
casklike
and
drinkability
is
good
as
well
a
pleasant
surprise
here
yum
cola
colored
wtih
a
medium
off
white
head
the
smell
is
malty
and
nutty
with
a
hint
of
vegetables
corn
carrots
not
good
the
vegetable
smell
blew
off
and
returned
a
few
times
in
the
couple
bottles
i
had
fortunately
it
was
virtually
undetectable
in
the
taste
it
had
a
decent
malty
backbone
with
some
sugary
tastes
too
and
a
nice
nutty
brown
ale
flavor
with
a
small
amount
of
detectable
maple
mouthfeel
was
different
it
had
body
but
also
a
thin
or
watery
charecter
to
it
as
well
it
had
syrupy
aspects
to
it
but
also
chewy
and
ligher
aspects
as
well
i
assume
this
is
the
reuslt
of
brewing
with
sypup
overall
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
we
cant
forget
the
funky
smell
but
mostly
it
was
drinkable
and
enjoyable
poured
a
clear
deep
reddishbrown
color
with
modest
creamy
slightly
offwhite
head
modest
lacing
smell
is
a
pleasant
mixture
of
roasted
malt
with
a
distinct
maple
syup
background
the
maple
syrup
really
comes
through
in
the
taste
and
is
suprisingly
enjoyable
reminds
me
a
scottish
ale
nice
full
creamy
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
but
would
never
try
to
session
yikes
this
beer
kind
of
tastes
like
a
mess
reminds
me
of
the
often
dreaded
caramel
porter
saranac
makes
seasonally
its
just
to
damn
sweet
the
bottom
line
it
looks
nice
enough
and
doesnt
smell
too
bad
but
i
just
cant
drink
this
one
and
i
can
usually
at
least
finish
a
bottle
of
anything
decent
call
it
a
maple
ale
maybe
i
couldnt
find
any
brown
overall
i
think
its
a
decent
brown
ale
the
sweetness
makes
it
a
little
different
from
the
crowd
pours
a
hazy
red
color
with
a
thick
head
of
large
bubbles
aroma
is
woody
lots
of
toasted
grain
possibly
a
lot
of
biscuit
malt
taste
is
odd¬Ö
almost
a
tart
flavor
nothing
like
expected
the
only
other
time
i
have
had
this
flavor
is
in
a
homebrew
batch
with
over
stressed
wheat
yeast
and
caramunich
malt
i
would
think
anyone
expecting
any
maple
flavor
would
be
very
disappointed
with
this
one
not
even
close
to
a
nut
brown
imo
not
a
drain
pour
but
style
wise
this
bottle
was
way
off
second
bottle
was
more
of
the
same
nothing
even
remotely
like
maple
syrup
or
a
nut
brown
ale
infection
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
drink
again
just
wish
it
had
a
touch
more
flavor
and
mouthfeel
d
this
one
is
enjoyable
a
nice
sweet
refresher
the
maple
syrup
sweetness
can
become
a
little
cloying
but
still
a
decent
beer
unusual
but
not
overly
complex
worth
a
try
taste
is
pretty
one
sided
with
the
main
flavors
being
some
malty
nuttiness
and
faint
maple
sugar
flavor
very
smooth
and
easy
on
the
mouthfeel
making
this
one
a
great
session
brew
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
bodycomplexity
to
it
before
being
labeled
great
mouthfeel
was
more
of
a
weak
porter
than
a
brown
ale
the
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
was
present
very
mild
almost
earthy
hops
not
much
sweetness
which
was
a
good
thing
in
my
book
a
good
froth
elicited
some
sweeter
malt
flavors
nothing
spectacular
but
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
do
2
on
draft
anytime
this
one
is
officially
my
least
favorite
brown
ale
of
all
time
at
least
that
was
my
opinion
at
first
sip
maybe
somthing
was
up
with
it
but
it
tasted
like
sour
skittles
were
added
to
the
flavor
nothing
else
worth
noting
could
barely
finish
it
tried
it
out
at
flying
saucer
charlotte
d
very
sweet
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
it
ok
for
what
it
is
maple
is
a
bit
artificial
flavored
not
full
and
rich
like
good
maple
syrup
i
like
the
way
that
tommyknocker
brewery
colors
outside
the
lines
they
add
lemongrass
to
jack
whacker
an
american
pale
wheat
and
they
add
maple
syrup
to
this
american
brown
bottom
line
maple
nut
brown
ale
is
good
beer
that
could
be
great
beer
by
adding
more
of
what
makes
it
good
beer
in
the
first
place
tommyknocker
maple
nut
brown
ale
pours
a
medium
brown
with
ruby
around
the
edges
the
aroma
is
maltynutty
taste
is
pretty
good
malt
dominates
and
there
is
a
nice
nut
taste
you
can
taste
the
maple
in
the
finish
which
is
on
the
sweet
side
i
like
this
its
quite
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
i
have
to
admit
i
approached
this
beer
with
some
hestitation
ive
had
a
couple
of
mapleflavored
beers
that
were
more
like
hungry
jack
pancake
syrup
than
beer
the
maple
in
this
beer
however
was
very
well
integrated
in
the
flavor
profile
a
midweight
brown
ale
with
pleasant
roasted
malt
flavor
the
maple
notes
melded
with
chocolate
malt
and
a
nutty
flavor
quite
nice
for
a
specialty
beer
all
in
all
i
would
say
that
it
is
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
but
may
be
a
better
dessert
beer
than
a
session
beer
dark
red
fairly
pleasant
aroma
with
notes
of
butter
toffee
caramel
coffee
beans
dark
fruits
and
maple
this
is
pretty
tasty
and
well
balanced
my
only
gripe
is
that
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
notes
of
dark
berries
toasted
munich
and
caramel
malts
along
with
slight
chocolate
and
coffee
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
just
slightly
less
than
medium
bodied
this
is
a
fairly
one
dimensional
beer
you
could
certainly
do
alot
worse
than
this
beer
i
wouldnt
be
upset
if
i
could
not
buy
this
beer
again
last
swigs
i
had
a
few
tommyknockers
in
the
past
few
weeks
and
i
dig
em
interesting
quality
brews
that
are
drinkable
and
tasty
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
brown
ale
they
are
better
browns
out
there
but
this
one
isnt
bad
well
the
maple
is
hard
to
pick
up
in
this
brew
it
is
a
deep
brown
color
the
smell
is
somewhat
like
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
semisweet
the
taste
is
more
like
caramel
to
me
than
maple
syrup
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
there
is
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
end
overall
a
drinkable
brew
that
i
could
try
again
never
knowing
what
you
get
from
tommyknocker
sometimes
wonderful
but
sometimes
lackluster
this
brown
ale
shows
a
lot
of
promise
starts
with
a
creamy
nutty
chocolateey
malty
flavor
and
develops
into
a
lightly
tart
sweet
thinning
body
in
the
finish
the
maple
syrup
adds
a
lot
of
sweetness
tartness
nuttiness
and
accentuates
the
chocolate
malts
never
thick
but
remains
creamy
and
finishes
a
little
lighter
than
expected
leaves
a
little
residual
sugar
on
the
toung
and
a
hint
of
twangy
fermentedness
not
overly
complex
yet
pleasant
and
nice
i
look
forward
to
having
another
the
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
thick
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
caramel
malt
scent
along
with
some
maple
notes
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
sweet
burnt
toffee
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
with
some
nutty
notes
and
finishes
dry
and
a
bit
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
brown
ale
it
has
a
wonderful
malt
flavor
and
aroma
a
fine
sessions
brew
darker
brown
color
transparent
with
a
flat
14
inch
head
simple
drips
and
marks
for
lace
you
can
get
a
bit
of
maple
syrup
from
the
aroma
a
bit
of
strange
sharp
grape
mouthfeel
is
shy
of
medium
carbonation
is
fairly
restrained
starts
out
with
the
maple
flavors
a
sense
of
cashews
practically
all
sweet
malt
in
the
impression
slightly
tangy
and
distracting
in
the
middle
with
a
finish
thats
kind
of
chalky
and
a
little
on
the
thin
side
not
overly
sweet
or
really
cloying
but
not
that
exciting
or
satisfying
either
syrup
shows
up
again
in
the
aftertaste
d
a
beer
i
will
eventually
try
again
especially
if
i
could
find
it
on
tap
a
good
beer
to
cap
off
your
night
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
are
looking
for
something
different
and
you
like
sweet
beers
a
notable
brew
i
decided
to
check
this
out
at
tylers
in
durham
was
a
pretty
dark
brown
as
a
brown
should
be
but
had
almost
no
head
appeared
kind
of
watery
aroma
was
very
meak
with
some
roasted
malts
maybe
the
taste
is
what
stuck
out
the
most
with
the
same
general
first
impression
as
a
watery
porter
rather
smoky
chocolaty
sweet
and
roasted
but
had
that
little
kick
of
maple
syrup
andor
brown
sugar
that
lingered
i
did
find
it
pretty
pleasant
but
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
night
no
carbonation
and
the
sweetness
was
pretty
powerful
overall
a
good
try
and
a
unique
beer
no
matter
what
anyone
says
not
sure
where
the
maple
is
in
this
more
caramel
than
anything
else
in
the
smell
and
taste
some
roasted
malt
and
yeast
in
the
finish
not
much
in
hops
department
smooth
and
drinks
easy
aroma
is
sharp
and
almost
cheese
like
redbrown
with
a
small
fading
head
basic
brown
ale
with
a
bit
of
woody
maple
sweetness
not
bad
not
good
actually
it
leans
a
little
toward
bad
just
in
that
it
kinda
sits
there
not
doing
anything
flavor
wise
except
being
mildly
sweet
and
if
you
only
have
one
trick
sweet
isnt
the
one
to
have
this
offering
poured
with
a
finely
beaded
head
and
released
an
intriguing
smell
nut
maple
and
malted
sweetness
the
body
is
brownish
amber
full
preparing
me
for
what
i
expect
is
an
onslaught
of
maple
syrup
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
full
bodied
wow
to
my
surprise
its
more
of
a
nutty
flavor
than
anything
and
is
certainly
at
the
forefront
the
maple
appropriately
dangles
in
the
background
and
actually
acts
as
a
nice
compliment
a
little
bit
of
a
toasted
bread
feel
it
finishes
with
a
little
nutty
grittiness
and
some
paler
maple
notes
while
not
the
greatest
in
the
world
it
surpassed
my
low
expectations
a
dark
brown
ale
with
with
a
nice
carmel
head
decent
lacing
as
i
tore
through
the
beer
which
alludes
to
the
drinkability
the
obvious
maple
smell
and
hints
of
carmel
sweet
and
a
smokey
wood
ester
the
taste
was
smooth
but
a
flat
in
carbonation
this
was
confirmed
by
the
last
of
the
growler
we
consumed
later
that
night
overall
an
above
average
brew
with
potential
i
remember
it
being
much
better
which
affects
my
personal
scoring
that
damn
russian
judge
in
my
head
this
brew
is
much
more
of
a
thin
porter
than
nut
brown
ale
had
an
awesome
head
with
great
retention
some
of
the
best
retention
ive
seen
in
a
while
actually
other
than
that
it
was
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
mapley
and
would
have
a
stronger
taste
associated
with
nut
brown
ales
but
this
was
kind
of
wimpy
the
maple
was
a
very
small
footnote
in
the
taste
something
you
had
to
concentrate
to
taste
oh
well
ive
said
it
before
so
ill
say
it
again
nothing
ventured
nothing
gained
12
oz
with
an
overdue
freshness
date
pours
a
very
dark
chestnut
with
blood
redcrimson
highlights
and
a
1
finger
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
leave
any
lace
smells
sweet
with
vinous
malts
and
maybe
some
chocolate
and
nuts
taste
follows
with
the
addition
of
molasses
caramel
some
woodiness
maple
and
a
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
average
at
best
this
brown
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
to
dark
copper
color
there
is
little
to
no
head
i
was
kinda
excited
about
this
beer
and
so
far
so
good
the
aroma
is
sweet
scent
of
roaster
nuts
as
well
as
chocolate
very
sweet
and
very
malty
as
expected
the
flavor
didnt
give
me
what
i
was
looking
for
maybe
thats
my
fault
too
little
of
everything
i
expected
powerful
malts
roasted
nuts
and
nice
chocolate
taste
i
got
a
little
roasted
malts
and
a
little
hint
of
others
the
finish
is
plain
and
boring
2
seconds
after
my
first
sip
my
mouth
forgot
what
it
had
tasted
all
in
all
a
decent
but
somewhat
plain
brown
ale
i
think
these
tommyknocker
elves
would
be
somewhat
disappointed
drinkability
this
was
not
very
balanced
effort
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
it
tasted
better
so
maybe
just
a
bad
bottle
drinkability
is
decent
different
and
sweet
seems
pretty
balanced
to
me
bottle
purchased
by
my
wife
at
a
local
store
and
consumed
a
couple
evenings
later
drink
within
4
months
of
01june05
pours
a
halffinger
light
tan
head
over
a
cloudy
brown
liquid
perhaps
some
red
in
there
too
smells
potently
maple
with
some
carameltoffee
tastes
woody
maple
with
biscuity
malt
undertones
and
a
buttery
sweet
finish
hints
of
chocolate
rise
late
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
refresher
of
the
woody
maple
pretty
simple
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
slick
moderate
carbonation
nice
to
try
but
not
one
ill
likely
return
to
as
a
regular
beer
could
be
useful
in
cooking
or
served
withafter
a
chocolatey
desert
body
is
light
medium
with
kind
of
a
watery
thin
mouthfeel
drinkable
but
not
desirable
yawn
appearance
is
pretty
standard
copper
color
ivory
foam
and
lace
aroma
has
some
roasted
grains
and
cashews
initial
taste
contains
toasty
malt
and
something
akin
to
caramel
and
toffee
not
a
great
example
of
a
nut
brown
¬ñ
there
are
better
ones
out
there
drinkability
thin
body
good
carbonation
and
sweet
maple
make
this
a
refreshing
brew
for
a
hot
sticky
wisconsin
summer
evening
i
think
i
might
give
it
another
try
after
i
make
my
rounds
through
some
other
recommended
brown
ales
there
was
just
something
about
that
maple
sweetness
that
i
really
enjoyed
a
solid
offering
from
tommyknocker
very
dark
brown
color
clear
with
alomst
no
head
smell
is
nutty
sweet
with
maple
presence
which
carriers
over
to
the
taste
which
also
has
a
nice
hop
finish
and
slight
chocolate
presence
mouthfeel
is
not
very
well
carbonated
pretty
good
brown
ale
but
there
are
betters
out
there
see
bells
best
brown
drinkability
the
only
bad
thing
was
the
carrot
smell
however
theres
not
a
lot
that
sets
this
beer
apart
only
the
maple
flavor
which
isnt
nearly
enough
to
overcome
its
almost
complete
lack
of
other
flavors
picked
this
up
in
bergen
park
about
15
minutes
from
where
its
brewed
in
idaho
springs
pours
a
mediumdark
brown
with
very
little
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smell
has
notes
of
maple
no
surprise
here
slightly
fruity
mediumlow
carbonation
taste
is
quite
good
definite
maple
here
as
well
plus
a
very
faint
charcoal
taste
on
the
finish
sweet
overall
with
a
finish
that
could
be
slightly
dryer
but
still
very
refreshing
leaves
a
faint
taste
of
pecan
on
the
tongue
after
youve
finished
overall
a
very
different
interesting
beer

this
is
a
solid
nut
brown
ale
i
was
a
little
leary
because
of
the
maple
aspect
and
figured
it
would
taste
the
way
flavored
coffee
does
to
my
surprise
it
didnt
the
appearance
was
a
nice
translucent
brown
with
a
meager
head
the
aroma
was
malty
with
aa
hint
of
maple
as
was
the
flavor
it
tasted
like
it
had
been
burtonized
possibly
which
i
really
think
truly
gives
it
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
i
appreciate
in
an
english
brown
ale
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
it
even
the
maple
was
quite
pleasant
at
the
level
it
was
at
brown
ales
are
pretty
low
on
my
personal
style
preference
this
beer
is
drinkable
clean
and
not
lacking
in
flavor
it
is
not
complex
or
robust
i
could
count
the
number
of
mild
brown
ales
ive
been
impressed
with
on
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
this
one
is
thin
bodied
and
lacking
substance
and
character
nothing
bad
about
this
one
but
it
could
be
improved
considerably
with
more
roasted
malt
and
a
hops
presence
on
tap
at
bostons
pours
a
deep
brown
slightly
cloudy
liquid
with
a
thin
white
head
head
retention
and
lace
were
not
very
good
grainy
and
sweet
smelling
with
syrup
slight
flavor
of
roasted
malt
combined
with
a
sweet
hint
of
maple
slightly
cloying
but
not
unbearable
not
much
hop
bitterness
or
flavor
lower
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
brown
ale
not
outstanding
but
a
good
version
the
slight
maple
flavor
is
pretty
nice
smooth
creamy
and
delicious
if
a
tad
uncomplex
for
my
taste
buds
a
great
dessert
beer
thats
a
step
ahead
of
newcastle
this
is
very
dark
for
a
brown
ale
it
had
a
small
white
head
that
disappeared
quick
it
does
smell
good
way
better
than
the
beer
tastes
the
maple
aroma
with
the
malts
they
use
is
quite
pleasing
the
taste
is
a
bit
watery
and
the
maple
syrup
overpowers
the
beer
in
a
bad
way
and
when
you
mix
in
the
fact
that
tommyknocker
brews
have
such
a
thin
body
the
beer
becomes
almost
undrinkable
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
brewer
but
so
far
i
am
unimpressed
this
was
the
first
of
the
tommyknocker
beers
that
i
actually
enjoyed
drinking
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
dies
off
and
leaves
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
maple
smell
along
with
a
malty
backing
and
a
small
bit
of
hops
the
flavor
is
very
clean
with
a
bit
of
roasted
and
maple
its
not
great
but
its
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
this
company
this
is
a
chore
to
drink
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
only
hints
of
reddish
light
coming
through
to
show
that
its
not
black
there
is
no
head
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
somewhat
weak
but
is
roasted
with
chocolate
the
flavor
is
a
little
weak
for
me
there
is
chocolate
and
some
of
the
maple
sweetness
coming
through
with
the
slightest
hint
of
hop
at
the
finish
id
prefer
more
flavor
andof
a
hop
finish
that
this
brings
the
beer
is
lighter
in
my
mouth
that
i
would
expect
as
well
its
only
moderately
thick
it
just
seems
a
bit
lacking
this
would
be
an
easy
beer
to
put
a
few
away
but
i
would
go
for
other
browns
with
more
flavor
over
this
one
not
bad
but
not
great
would
drink
again
but
would
not
seek
out
after
trying
once
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
rich
offwhite
to
tan
head
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
and
toasted
nuts
also
touches
of
maple
syrup
taste
is
mellow
yet
flavorful
with
some
toasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
hopsbitterness
quite
sweet
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
would
be
good
poured
over
some
ice
cream
this
beer
even
though
bland
was
very
refreshing
and
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
still
it
left
alot
to
be
desired
deep
amber
hue
with
a
thinring
head
that
will
vanish
but
maintain
some
patchy
lacing
throughout
initial
appearance
is
clumpy
a
sweet
and
nutty
perhaps
maple
syrup
detected
on
the
nose
up
front
a
defining
maple
syrup
sweetness
is
thrashing
on
the
palate
medium
bodied
perhaps
some
caramel
notes
some
malt
backbone
an
overwhelming
sourness
throughout
a
smooth
residual
free
palate
yet
the
overpowering
sweetsour
twanginess
is
too
much
to
make
this
drinkable
not
bad
but
for
the
style
a
bit
out
of
line
the
maple
nut
brown
poured
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
it
had
a
smallish
head
with
tiny
bubbles
that
quickly
dissipated
to
a
thin
film
it
had
a
subtle
malty
nutty
nose
with
some
maple
thrown
in
it
has
a
nice
full
bodied
malty
maple
taste
maybe
a
tad
too
sweet
though
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
like
to
order
all
the
time
a
deep
chestnut
body
rests
beneath
a
thin
veil
of
white
foam
that
dissipates
readily
and
leaves
no
more
than
a
smattering
of
tiny
spotted
lace
but
the
aroma
is
more
impressive
than
the
appearance
with
a
nutty
toasted
graininess
and
sweetish
maple
syrup
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
restrained
allowing
the
sweetness
to
come
through
maple
syrup
definitely
contributes
to
the
flavor
at
least
in
its
sweetness
but
the
main
component
is
the
very
nice
nutty
toasty
caramelish
and
slightly
chocolatey
malt
base
beneath
hops
are
downplayed
and
leave
just
a
subliminal
bitterness
and
no
flavor
whatsoever
it
finishes
as
might
be
expected
with
some
residual
malt
and
a
clearer
note
of
maple
syrup
than
is
evident
prior
surprisingly
however
its
not
cloying
its
interesting
somewhat
complex
and
drinkable
although
i
think
it
needs
to
be
reserved
as
a
specialty
beer
because
beyond
one
serving
the
sugars
do
tend
to
start
to
build
on
the
palate
still
very
nice
indeed
the
apperance
of
this
was
okay
it
was
nice
and
brownish
red
with
a
little
head
it
smelled
of
caramel
and
sweet
malt
it
tasted
a
little
off
kind
of
like
a
stale
malt
sweetness
it
was
okay
i
couldnt
drink
many
of
these
in
one
setting
a
little
dissapointed
deep
dark
brown
color
offwhite
thin
head
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
moderate
smells
of
maple
syrup
and
hazelnut
toasted
malts
break
through
too
overall
very
inviting
smell
taste
was
marked
by
a
highly
charged
carbonation
lots
of
bubbles
to
start
seemed
to
keep
the
flavors
in
check
some
maple
syrup
and
chocolate
hints
of
hazelnut
the
label
made
me
think
it
would
be
more
maple
syrup
and
more
nutty
toasted
malts
finish
up
an
slightly
better
than
average
brown
ale
drinkable
yes
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
not
as
full
bodied
and
flavorful
as
the
brooklyn
brown
ale
i
had
recently
not
in
the
same
class
as
the
rogue
hazelnut
brown
nectar
transparent
brown
on
the
pour
with
a
modest
frothy
head
that
is
a
light
tan
color
the
lace
adequate
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
maple
syrup
sweet
fresh
and
inviting
nicely
malted
and
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
top
is
rather
thin
finish
mellow
on
the
carbonation
hops
adequate
and
the
sweetness
carries
to
the
slightly
dry
aftertaste
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
big
hit
with
me
tommyknockers
had
a
brewpub
here
but
closed
down
and
mores
the
pity
as
i
found
some
of
their
beers
quite
enjoyable
especially
on
tap
maple
flavors
come
thru
as
it
rises
to
cellar
temp
close
but
no
cigars
this
one
has
potential
if
it
had
a
bit
more
body
this
brew
pours
a
small
head
of
light
brown
bubbles
and
a
semitransparent
brown
body
it
has
a
very
nice
semi
strong
malt
aroma
and
fizzy
smoky
harsh
taste
that
is
a
little
weak
very
nutty
with
only
a
fair
lacing
strange
taste
in
this
not
really
to
my
liking
overall
impression
if
you
arent
a
big
dark
beer
fan
this
is
probably
a
good
introduction
to
heavier
beers
might
be
a
good
beer
to
start
to
educate
your
coors
light
drinking
friends
pours

with
an
offwhite

aroma
consists
of
caramel
malt
maple

grain
mouthfeel
is
thinnish
and
somewhat
watered
down
maple
flavor
is
quite
noticable
in
taste
and
adds
a
definite
sweetness
to
the
beer
toasted
malt
and
hints
of
nut
add
more
dimension
finish
is
somewhat
husky
and
a
bit
dry
at
times
not
bad
overall
but
after
a
couple
the
sweetness
becomes
too
much
not
a
great
session
beer
this
brown
ale
poured
a
creamy
medium
tan
head
with
smallmedium
bubbles
there
was
some
carbonation
observed
with
this
ale
there
was
very
little
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
body
was
brown
in
color
i
thought
the
taste
was
a
little
tart
and
bitey
which
i
did
not
care
for
at
all
i
could
not
acquire
a
good
taste
for
this
brew
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
shows
very
good
retention
and
leaves
a
thick
sheeting
on
the
glass
from
a
distance
the
maple
syrup
aroma
is
evident
upon
taking
a
deep
whiff
the
maple
syrup
note
is
more
of
a
light
brown
sugar
note
atop
a
hint
of
malt
not
much
of
a
hop
prescence
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
a
bit
funky
and
seems
like
two
beersbeverages
in
one
sort
of
a
jekyll
and
hyde
of
beers
theres
a
nice
brown
ale
wanting
to
come
out
but
a
friggin
wine
cooler
keeps
pushing
him
back
in
the
maple
notes
seem
artificial
and
overlayed
atop
a
nice
nut
brown
ale
theres
almost
a
tartness
on
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
hop
bittering
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
nothing
special
the
drinakbility
is
a
little
poor
becuase
i
know
theres
a
good
beer
under
here
but
it
seems
like
they
tried
to
do
too
much
with
the
flavor
good
idea
bad
result
newcastle
meets

almost
a
citrussour
the
date
was
good
so
maybe
i
was
expecting
something
more
perhaps
ill
give
it
another
try
someday
dissipates
oh
so
quickly
smell
is
the
best
thing
about
the
beer
it
has
a
sweet
2001
a
nice
brown
ale
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
draft
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
very
nice
use
of
maple
syrup
well
done
recommended
meticulously
crafted
with
pure
maple
syrup
and
the
highest
quality
chocolate
and
crystal
malts
with
its
big
malty
and
complex
character
it
is
a
strapping
bolder
version
of
their
wildly
popular
maple
nut
brown
overall
i
have
to
say
i
really
think
theyve
nailed
what
you
would
expect
from
an
imperial
nut
brown
ale
with
maple
syrup
the
finish
may
seem
a
bit
astringent
but
i
personally
dont
mind
this
as
the
front
and
center
are
bold
and
fruity
with
plenty
of
nuttiness
and
semisweet
roastiness
interesting
and
potent
give
this
one
a
try
o
this
surely
doesnt
drink
like
a
9
beer
the
maple
works
well
with
the
nuttiness
of
the
malt
easy
drinking
beer
that
will
definitely
catch
up
with
you
overall
good

ruby
brown
in

with
good
light
tan

good
lacing
and
a
thick

aroma
is
dark
molasses
nutty
and
earthy
taste
follows
pretty
much
identically
mild
hop
bitterness
in
this
one
mediumlight
body
and
medium
carbonation
definitely
my
favorite
of
the
three
beers
i
had
at
the
brewery
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
a
medium
bodied
with
great
taste
profile
that
carries
well
onto
the
palate
and
beyond
pours
a
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
small
tan
head
lots
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
maple
syrup
and
grassy
hops
actually
brewed
with
maple
syrup
nice
aroma
the
taste
was
actually
very
smooth
with
that
high
alcohol
content
unlike
other
9
brews
smooth
rich
flavor
that
was
pretty
tasty
with
no
harsh
aftertaste
lots
of
flavours
lots
of
alcohol
but
not
as
sweet
as
expected
an
ok
after
dinner
ale
mouthfeel
syrupy
but
not
too
much
so
light
carbonation
i
bit
too
big
for
me
i
think
nut
browns
shouldnt
be
imperial
ive
always
said
overall
a
nice
beer
but
more
of
a
sipping
beer
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
o
good
experience
and
good
winter
brew
but
i
probably
could
only
drink
1
5
servings
because
its
just
too
bitter
def
worth
a
try
cause
at
least
youll
be
feeling
good
so
apparently
tommyknocker
and
their
new
labels
have
entered
the
chicagoland
market
okay
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
russetgarnet
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
ashen
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
rich
caramel
sweet
coffee
imagine
sniffing
the
air
at
the
mall
right
at
the
edge
of
the
food
court
where
theres

with

a

what
could
have
been
a
solid

by
the
smell

allowed
itself

overall
nice
im
a
sucker
for
good
brown
and
this
is
bit
unusual
in
a
good
way
a
little
water
body
the
nose
is
extraordinary
o
excellent
imperial
nut
brown
ale
love
the
maple
syrup
medium
bodied
and
surprisingly
hop
forward
for
the
style
some
dry
bitterness
complimented
by
a
complex
malt
bill
and
maple
sweetness
a
bit
more
roast
than
expected
but
nit
overly
dry
or
acrid
with
hints
of
coffee
and
toast
this
is
cut
by
the
maple
sweetness
as
well
as
some
subtle
spice
caramel
toffee
and
hazelnut
decently
balanced
and
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
but
theres
an
odd
lingering
aftertaste
that
hurts
drinkability
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
i
would
go
for
this
one
again
ok
a
brown
ale
maybe
my
first
on
a
trade
i
slipped
this
in
to
my
tumbler
so
nothing
on
the
head
and
i
dont
care
either
and
looks
dark
like
a
stale
cola
or
neglected
coffee
or
warm
prune
juice
or
an
oil
change
smells
like
this
will
be
a
malt
bomb
too
as
it
should
be
taste
is
malty
and
dry
and
slightly
bitter
with
ripe
fruit
and
prune
and
late
cherries
but
im
not
detecting
the
maple
seems
a
wasted
carbohydrate
to
add
to
the
vat
it
all
turned
to
booze
and
i
know
what
im
talking
about
having
had
my
maple
trees
tapped
and
im
semiaddicted
to
the
stuff
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
any
maple
here
but
id
be
walloped
too
if
there
were
any
thinking
that
beer
might
be
the
surest
way
to
kill
the
subtle
flavor
in
maple
and
nuts
dont
detect
them
either
for
nine
percent
booze
doesnt
seems
that
alcohol
forward
malty
not
being
my
thing
and
bitter
more
than
anything
is
what
im
after
i
can
say
this
was
a
serviceable
beer
only
and
not
really
the
beer
for
memeaning
the
style
more
than
the
brewery
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
mahogany
with
a
hint
of
red
it
pours
up
with
a
full
two
finger
head
and
leaves
delicate
spiderweb
type
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
subtle
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
taste
is
very
sweet
as
expected
with
a
lot
of
malt
character
but
the
alcohol
is
just
too
overpowering
on
the
finish
a
little
more
hops
and
less
alcohol
and
it
would
be
awesome
overall
drinkability
i
think
the
normal
version
of
this
beer
is
the
superior
one
its
far
more
flavorful
and
aromatic
and
to
boot
its
a
lot
more
sessionable
this
one
is
good
and
is
a
great
slow
sipper
with
the
malt
bomb
it
is
but
it
doesnt
wow
me
like
its
less
boozy
cousin
so
drinkability
is
one
and
done
dont
get
me
wrong
though
flavor
is
great
and
right
up
my
alley
but
somehow
the
overall
package
especially
the
appearance
was
underwhelming
compared
to
the
other
still
worth
a
try
and
glad
i
got
it
i
just
will
probably
reach
for
normal
strength
when
offered
o
a
really
good
american
brown
ale
like
their
maple
nut
brown
on
steroids
o
i
had
this
after
having
tried
founders
frangelic
mountain
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
id
say
it
is
easily
on
par
and
lacks
some
of
the
more
artificialseeming
flavors
of
the
fmb
this
was
good
and
enjoyable
beer
was
surprised
by
the
thinner
feel
but
good
flavors
and
drinkability
add
a
huge
plus
a
good
high
abv
brown
that
is
reasonably
priced
certainly
worth
picking
up
again

flavors
are
pretty
good
but
they
arent
as
robust
or
balanced
as
i
was
hoping
hardly
any
maple
flavor
in
the
taste
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
feels
a
bit
thin
for
a
9
beer
but
it
is
good
enough
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
light
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
imperial
brown
ale
some
nice
flavors
with
decent
balance
and
quite
smooth
to
drink
for
the
alcohol
level
not
super
drinkable
this
was
my
only
beer
of
the
night
drinks
bigger
than
the
abv
not
a
big
fan
overall
surprisingly
nondescript
flavors
are
pleasant
and
well
done
but
are
overpowered
by
the
alcohol
id
also
like
a
bit
more
body
as
it
is
it
comes
off
like
light
syrup
that
being
said
i
havent
had
another
beer
quite
like
it
tommyknocker
has
the
maple
ale
thing
pretty
well
figured
out
and
it
sets
them
apart
i
might
give
it
a
go
again
if
i
decide
to
whip
up
a
batch
of
beerfortified
pancakes
i
recommend
checking
this
one
out
it
is
a
good
one
quite
drinkable
especially
for
a
beer
of
this
size
certainly
check
it
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
the
nonimperial
version
or
maple
syrup
in
general
in
fact
just
check
it
out
anyway
and
appreciate
the
work
gone
into
crafting
this
brew
o
the
alcohol
is
hidden
extremely
well
but
the
maple
turns
this
into
a
wholly
different
beer
than
i
think
they
were
trying
for
light
carbonation
overall
its
a
sweet
and
sticky
sipper
revised
july
2013
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
is
the
appearance
in
a
glass
is
has
a
decent
head
and
laces
teh
glass
nicely
it
looks
like
it
woudl
taste
better
than
it
does
i
anticipated
it
being
a
little
heavier
and
creamier
the
malt
is
just
right
though
i
think
i
would
prefer
if
it
was
a
bit
creamier
it
has
a
slight
bitter
hint
despite
it
being
a
malty
brown
that
makes
for
a
nice
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
what
you
would
expect
from
an
imperial
ale
overall
this
is
a
very
good
imperial
brown
i
havent
had
many
imperial
browns
and
would
order
this
again
at
the
taproom
pours
a
dark
somewhat
transparent
colabrown
with
a
very
thick
and
rather
persistent
light
tan
head
strong
malty
aroma
has
an
overtone
of
molasses
and
a
hint
of
maple
syrup
malty
flavor
has
a
sweet
syrupy
overtone
and
woody
nutty
and
caramel
notes
it
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
very
little
hop
bitterness
but
still
pleasing
and
tasty
firm
smooth
texture
has
just
a
little
fizz
but
you
feel
it
going
down
the
pipes
overall
a
worthy
brew
a
good
beer
that
i
was
surprised
got
such
low
ratings
maybe
im
biased
because
i
love
maple
syrup
a
nice
sweetness
that
is
complemented
by
the
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
and
nuttiness
overall
this
is
excellent
it
goes
down
too
smooth
for
9
8
i
mean
seriously
be
careful
with
this
one
i
have
been
caught
in
its
snares
excellent
beer
i
recommend
one
for
dessert
this
big
complex
and
malty
offering
weighs
in
at
hefty
9
abv
and
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
borderline
black
with
a
quickly
disappearing
beige
head
that
leaves
a
light
ring
around
the
the
glass
aromas
of
coffee
nuts
roasted
malt
and
some
slight
alcohol
notes
create
a
rich
bouquet
chocolate
and
nuttiness
are
featured
quite
heavily
on
the
pallet
with
a
slight
alcohol
twinge
in
the
finish
a
medium
body
is
met
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
definitely
a
big
beer
with
much
more
subtleties
then
the
maple
nut
brown
beer
is
sweet
medium
bodied
bitter
finish
mild
roast
overall
a
nice
little
beer
id
have
it
again
although
i
wasnt
blown
away
o
good
brown
ale
sweetness
isnt
as
cloying
as
i
thought
it
would
be
worth
a
try
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
as
much
as
the
brewers
standard
maple
nut
brown
ale
which
is
a
nice
beer
the
other
beer
is
easydrinking
and
has
a
nice
mild
malty
sweetness
not
an
alcohol
sweetness
for
me
this
one
is
boozy
and
syrupy
and
kind
of
gross
however
dont
let
me
detain
you
i
encourage
you
to
crack
one
open
and
try
it
yourself
this
is
an
enjoyable
sweet
mapley
sipper
overall
i
like
this
a
lot
edit
this
does
really
well
with
some
age
on
it
the
maple
aspect
really
develops
the
alcohol
mellows
and
the
whole
thing
just
gets
better
integrated
very
tasty
now
the
maple
is
a
clever
touch
but
they
couldve
dialed
back
on
it
or
let
the
hops
speak
a
little
more
imo
sure
the
latter
wouldve
taken
it
in
less
traditional
brown
ale
territory
but
youre
already
brewing
a
9
brown
ale
so
id
say
convention
already
went
out
the
window
as
it
is
good
but
not
great
overall
a
decent
beer
but
one
i
will
probably
not
buy
again
the
sweetness
was
nice
but
the
aftertaste
put
me
off
o
a
nice
effort
here
i
liked
the
maple
syrup
ill
probably
just
stick
to
my
old
standards
as
far
as
brown
ales
are
concerned
but
this
imperial
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
worth
a
try
d
drinkability
is
very
high
excellent
nut
brown
the
best
ive
had
in
this
style
good
flavors
but
honestly
nothing
that
new
or
spectacular
overall
its
been
a
good
long
while
since
i
last
tried
inba
about
6
six
years
by
my
guess
i
fully
recall
not
digging
it
then
and
im
just
not
really
digging
it
now
poured
a
dark
brown
color
moderately
hazy
with
a
decent
cap
of
offwhite
head
that
left
a
bit
of
lacing
woody
aroma
nutty
and
a
little
soapy
some
booze
taste
of
roasted
malts
nuts
a
little
much
on
the
boozy
side
with
just
a
hint
of
maple
sweetness
and
brown
sugar
a
bit
on
the
harsh
side
and
somewhat
watery
might
have
been
better
if
well
it
wasnt
a
brown
ale
medium
mouthfeel
and
overall
just
a
bit
lacking
in
flavor
due
to
the
general
blandness
i
usually
experience
with
brown
ales
and
with
the
alcohol
thinning
it
out
too
much
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
again
this
isnt
really
a
looker
a
deep
brown
with
a
tiny
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
for
long
the
aroma
is
pretty
good
though
a
nice
roasty
alcoholic
malt
smell
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
the
taste
is
pretty
good
a
nice
roasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
which
leads
into
a
strong
finish
with
alcohol
and
nuts
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
solid
if
unexceptional
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
from
tommyknocker
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
nut
brown
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
tastes
more
like
an
ris
than
anything
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
like
any
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
i
know
im
harping
on
it
but
the
alcohol
is
masking
what
could
be
a
much
better
brew
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
american
brown
ale
this
beer
can
definitely
hang
with
the
other
higher
alcohol
brown
ales
like
palo
santo
marron
this
beer
was
much
better
then
their
maple
nut
brown
ale
the
imperial
version
did
a
great
job
at
making
all
the
flavors
from
the
original
more
robust
and
tastier
the
maple
syrup
actually
stuck
out
in
this
beer
as
opposed
to
not
being
able
to
find
it
in
the
base
beer
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
i
liked
how
the
maple
syrup
flavor
showed
up
and
all
the
other
flavors
made
for
a
pretty
complex
beer
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
wasnt
bad
it
was
just
very
sweet
and
not
nearly
as
complex
as
the
flavor
this
beer
had
awesome
drinkability
there
was
a
little
alcohol
warmth
but
it
was
pretty
low
and
not
that
noticeable
i
could
probably
drink
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
which
is
pretty
good
for
a
beer
over
9
i
will
for
sure
be
going
back
to
the
store
to
buy
some
more
for
1
79
this
beer
is
a
steal
with
the
combination
of
smoothness
flavor
and
price
this
may
be
my
go
to
imperial
brown
ale
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
if
you
are
starting
to
get
bored
with
all
the
average
american
brown
ales
give
this
one
a
try
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
with
the
original
beer
so
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
the
imperial
version
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
how
well
it
turned
out
so
far
this
has
been
my
favorite
beer
from
tommyknocker
and
i
would
say
its
right
up
there
with
palo
santo
marron
as
my
favorite
imperial
brown
ale
good
job
tommyknocker
you
guys
really
surprised
me
with
this
one
keep
up
the
good
work
overall
this
is
the
first
maple
beer
that
ive
actually
enjoyed
it
seems
like
such
a
good
pairing
but
there
area
lot
of
bad
executions
of
the
idea
overall
i
honestly
didnt
know
what
to
expect
for
an
imperial
brown
ale
this
was
a
style
that
always
struck
me
as
a
lowalcohol
drinkable
sessiontype
beer
this
is
definitely
more
of
a
sipper
but
they
still
managed
to
catch
a
noticeable
nutty
flavor
amid
the
booze
and
maple
pours
a
deep
chocolatecolored
brown
with
very
little
head
the
smell
of
bread
nuts
and
a
slight
whiff
alcohol
is
present
the
most
noticeable
taste
is
the
maple
syrup
but
there
is
a
strong
malt
profile
here
as
well
alcohol
is
hidden
rather
well
in
this
one
but
you
get
a
slight
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
as
the
beer
warms
this
is
a
solid
effort
from
tommyknocker
that
quickly
ranks
among
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
that
i
have
tasted
in
some
time
i
really
like
the
viscosity
and
carbonation
level
in
this
beer
its
got
a
substantial
thickness
to
it
but
its
not
completely
flat
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
smell
is
nice
maple
syrup
caramel
malts
nutty
this
smells
very
rich
and
sweet
with
little
hops
to
back
to
balance
it
out
i
expect
a
malt
bomb
feel
is
thick
and
somewhat
syrupy
very
nice
the
taste
is
a
little
lacking
while
everything
else
is
so
great
first
the
abv
isnt
well
hidden
at
all
i
get
plenty
of
alcohol
taste
on
the
finish
more
than
anything
else
this
isnt
quite
the
malt
bomb
i
expected
although
it
has
plenty
of
malts
i
get
some
maple
and
caramel
perhaps
a
little
toffee
its
good
except
for
the
very
dominating
alcohol
after
flavor
lessens
its
appeal
its
still
good
but
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
so
much
better
from
the
pour
and
feel
it
is
something
ill
buy
again
when
im
in
the
wee
heavy
type
of
mood
the
smell
was
rich
and
sweet
predominant
aroma
was
a
caramel
with
a
touch
of
an
earthy
malt
a
light
feeling
was
released
by
this
so
you
really
did
not
think
you
were
going
into
anything
too
terribly
heavy
as
it
warmed
you
could
pick
up
a
roasted
or
burnt
smell
coming
though
as
well
as
a
touch
of
a
hop
note
rounding
out
the
back
caramel
that
you
caught
right
up
front
along
with
a
burnt
or
roasted
wood
flavor
almost
had
a
touch
of
oaked
flavor
in
it
some
hoppiness
in
the
finish
but
nothing
distracting
from
the
primary
notes
a
good
solid
brown
ale
flavor
as
best
as
i
can
describe
it
finish
was
a
little
nutty
and
dry
overall
drinkability
decent
beer
rating
it
in
style
its
pretty
good
but
i
havent
had
many
the
beer
is
straight
brown
with
a
thin
filmy
light
brown
head
that
left
lacing
smell
is
a
bomb
of
caramel
nuts
and
maple
with
some
earthiness
it
tastes
the
exact
same
as
it
smells
but
it
also
has
an
alcohol
bite
and
an
earthy
bitterness
the
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
with
low
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
my
first
imperial
nut
brown
and
i
thought
it
was
very
good
i
would
like
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
mf
full
bodied
and
syrupy
a
little
difficult
for
a
summers
day
but
has
great
potential
for
a
winter
warmer
o
the
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
well
sweet
roasty
and
earthy
tastes
dominate
the
palette
with
a
decent
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
nice
sipper
but
not
really
sure
if
i
would
revisit
this
again
in
the
future
the
aroma
has
a
notable
amount
of
maple
along
with
some
toffee
the
taste
is
even
better
lots
of
maple
and
some
extra
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
prominent
but
not
overbearing
very
enjoyable
its
quite
smooth
and
i
teared
up
a
bit
when
it
was
finished
meh
not
bad
nothing
special
after
being
spoiled
by
cigar
citys
and
surlys
browns
this
just
doesnt
compare
thanks
to
taturbo
for
the
tommyknocker
tick
o
great
nut
heat
cuts
back
a
minuet
bit
on
the
overall
drinkability
but
the
alcohol
is
high
for
what
all
else
it
has
backing
it
up
having
about
4x
the
carbonation
would
definitely
help
bring
this
beer
to
life
as
it
is
chocolate
and
caramel
taste
was
quite
similar
to
smell
cinnamon
mostly
medium
roasted
caramel
malts
with
strong
alcohol
taste
is
rounded

if
your

cocoa

that
leaves
a

maple
finish
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
with
a

this
is
a

im
glad
this

is
simply
one
of
the

brews
ive
ever
sampled
i
plan
to
get
another
six

and
put
a

on
it

but
appropriate
the
alcohol
is
not
highly
prominent
which
is
a
bit
overdone
with
the
big
flavors
going
on
here
it
could
benefit
from
more
carbonation
overall
some
chocolate
taste
is
pretty
decent
more
chocolate
comes
through
and
you
can
taste
a
hint
of
the
maple
syrup
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
i
got
no
hint
of
the
hops
roasty
with
some

not

the
brown
ale
on

thats
the
style
roasty
mostly
of
alcohol
and
prunes
this
one
was
fairly
tasty
not
quite
on
the
level
of
the
other
imperial
brown
ive
had
but
short
of
heavy
overall
and
some

the
taste

its
no

than
any

5444take
a
regular
nut
brown
and
up
the
yeast
and
here
you
go
a
noble
and
more
or
less
successful
experiment
but
for
what
it
purports
to
be
an
imperial
brown
ale
and
creamy
smooth
the
first
sip
set
off
a
lightbulb
in
my
brain
wavz
overall
the
imperial
part
of
the
brown
ale
is
nothing
too
exciting
lots
of
malts
a
little
off
balanced
easy
enough
to
drink
especially
after
it
gets
to
room
temperature
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
nice
imperial
brown
froma
brewery
i
have
never
tried
before
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
and
i
would
be
inclined
to
try
some
others
by
this
brewery
also
while
watching
the
boxing
marathon
on
espn
classic
and
having
the
manic
street
preachers
on
the
hifi
thought
it
was
time
to
enjoy
a
brew
a
22oz
bottle
wrapped
in
gold
foil
around
the
cap
neck
large
scroll
label
which
has
a
nice
singe
on
the
side
the
back
label
tells
me
that
the
tommyknockers
were
mischievous
elves
who
slipped
into
the
minning
camp
of
cornish
miners
maple
syrup
wonder
if
it
is
the
good
stuff
the
syrup
you
get
when
you
go
up
north
to
nh
vt
to
hit
the
ski
slopes
just
like
good
beer
nothing
beats
real
maple
syrup
there
is
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
remove
the
foil
wrap
to
find
a
bearded
miner
on
the
cap
with
a
hard
hat
a
mug
of
tommyknocker
imperial
nut
brown
no
doubt
in
his
left
and
a
pickaxe
in
his
right
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
dark
brown
clear
liquid
with
a
nice
head
i
smell
the
syrup
and
some
sugar
too
where
are
my
waffles
the
head
did
not
last
long
my
first
taste
was
very
smooth
maple
flavor
and
some
cocoa
it
is
tasty
and
at
9

abv
you
dont
feel
the
heat
on
my
cheeks
9
well
not
right
away
anyway
i
did
enjoy
this
while
riddick
bowe
vs
evander
holyfield
iii
i
would
try
it
again
a
pleasant
brew
my
first
nut
brown
ever
will
not
be
my
last
the
appearance
of
this
brew
is
what
i
think
a
brown
ale
should
look
like
i
rarely
give
a
5
but
this
is
deserving
deep
brown
with
a
fair
tan
head
and
lacing
a
plenty
the
smell
is
caramel
and
slightly
metallic
fair
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
of
smoke
oak
maple
syrup
and
a
myriad
of
other
flavers
combined
good
the
higher
abv
is
not
evident
immediently
but
shows
a
little
as
the
ears
warm
and
turn
red
mouthfeel
is
good
considering
the
abv
a
good
drinkable
beer
that
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
imperial
brown
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
this
is
my
first
time
having
an
offering
from
the
tommyknocker
brewery
and
it
was
a
treat
if
you
like

minimal
spotty

emits
rich

full

with
a
fine

not
as
rich
and
hefty
as

would
expect
from
the
nose
pleasing
notes
of
dark
fruit
cocoa
toffee
roasted
malts
and
molasses
with
a
faint
hop
and
alcohol
presence
to
tame
the
sweetness
unfortunately
seems
to
have
a
slight
weird
midpalate
watery
thiness
that
detracts
from
the
enjoyment
overall
very
reminiscent
of
an
englishstyle

me

it¬ís
a

deal
and
certainly

another
visit
or
two
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
first
imperial
nut
brown
ale
that
i
have
tasted
a
good
beer
for
the
money
and
the
mouth
this
is
a
sweet
tasty
malty
brew
that
hides
its
nearly
10
alcohol
very
well
its
quite
drinkable
and
tasty
but
i
thought
the
maple
flavor
was
a
bit
subdued
im
typically
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
fine
brew
that
cannot
be
beat
for
the
price
i
highly
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
very
dark
brown
and
crimson
when
held
to
the
light
tanyellow
colored
head
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
layer
of
small
bubbles
sweet
malty
nose
with
notes
of
bold
fruits
and
raspberry
aromas
are
echoed
in
the
flavor
with
maple
syrup
as
a
prominent
point
of
sweetness
starting
off
is
a
more
sweet
tart
wave
with
flashes
of
carbonation
on
the
perimeters
earthy
roasted
nuts
are
heavier
at
the
end
of
the
gulp
and
follows
strong
into
the
finish
you
are
aware
of
the
alcohol
but
doesn¬ít
get
in
the
way
of
its
finer
flavors
as
it
warms
notes
of
vanilla
banana
and
smoke
appear
full
body
and
a
syrupy
thick
mouthfeel
with
a
touch
of
cream
hear
and
there
d
an
interesting
take
on
a
traditional
style
the
amped
up
sweetness
is
nice
without
overpowering
the
nutty
base
overall
impression
a
nut
brown
with
a
huge
alcohol
warming
hence
imperial
for
sure
a
winter
beer
the
alcohol
dominates
the
rest
of
the
flavoring
malt
and
hop
flavors
a
great
example
of
an
imperial
brown
and
doesnt
stray
from
the
brown
ale
category
drinkability
while
the
alcohol
may
keep
me
from
drinking
too
many
of
these
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
d
this
style
wasnt
one
of
my
favorites
a
first
but
it
has
started
to
grow
on
me
and
this
is
the
best
that
ive
had
in
this
style
this
beer
is
tasty
has
a
damn
good
kick
to
it
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
with
9
80
abv
its
slightly
filling
but
i
can
still
drink
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
this
beer
and
enjoy
every
sip
of
it
i
know
imperial
gets
thrown
around
rather
loosely
and
ive
never
seen
it
used
for
a
nut
brown
before
but
this
beer
certainly
seems
worthy
of
the
term
very
rich
but
still
slightly
thin
bodied
but
i
really
dug
the
10
buried
behind
the
smooth
malty
body
of
this
frosty
slid
down
as
easy
as
a
45
brew
¬ñ
which
makes
it
kinda
dangerous
i
lost
interest
in
this
halfway
through
my
glass
seems
too
artificial
for
it
to
really
come
together
as
a
satisfying
beer
its
not
awful
but
i
cant
recommend
it
meh
i
usually
like
nut
browns
so
styles
not
the
problem
this
imperial
brown
ale
is
random
and
under
developed
it
has
the
abv
of
a
big
beer
but
every
aspect
of
it
is
scattered
around
most
of
the
components
and
flavors
are
there
but
they
dont
come
together
in
a
good
pleasing
way
a
beery
maple
syrup
color
leaves
a
22oz

into
my
imperial

great
syrupy

highlight
with
a
very
deep
brown
molasses
middle
a
nice
subtle
sweet
maple
aroma
mixed
with
some
cocoa
butter
and
vanilla
bring
out
interesting
notes
in
this
beer
the
start
is
a
mdeium
roast
with
some
mapley
sweetness
sfter
awhile
i
noticed
some
brown
sugar
and
molasses
and
toffee
notes
good
night
cap
beer
on
a
cold
fall
evening
drinkability
i
am
impressed
by
this
brew
a
very
interesting
new
style
they
created
if
one
is
worried
by
the
name
that
is
may
be
too
sweet
dont
its
not
at
all
sweet
yes
but
balanced
very
well
and
the
alcohol
is
virtually
completly
masked
if
you
like
impy
stouts
give
this
neat
brown
brew
a
try
from
the
bottle
poured
a
nice
mahogany
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
aroma
toast
dark
cherries
plums
red
grapes
roasted
malts
some
smoke
as
it
warmes
alcohol
and
nice
sweetness
comes
out
flavor
the
malts
and
hops
come
out
nicely
followed
by
cherries
maple
syrup
with
a
good
hit
of
alcohol
easy
drinking
beer
will
get
more
of
this
the
drinkability
falls
of
some
but
not
bad
a
big
bottle
but
i
could
have
more
the
price
ir
right
mk
d
limit
to
a
couple
the
hops
sharpen
it
in
the
finale
to
the
point
that
goes
beyond
its
malty
side
nevertheless
a
strong
nut
brown
ale
that
surprises
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
intense
of
alcohol
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
roasted
nut
feel
that
lingers
along
the
palate
nice
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
accompanied
by
a
pungently
sweet
syrup
aspect
that
is
followed
by
a
surprisingly
bitter
hoppiness
a
very
mild
nutty
character
is
barely
detectable
behind
the
other
bolder
components
the
high
alcohol
is
completely
masked
which
would
make
this
dangerous
if
i
wanted
to
continue
drinking
more
than
one
bottle
of
this
but
it
is
too
sweet
for
me
to
want
to
pursue
that
option
overall
flavors
are
a
little
subdued
more
robust
flavor
would
be
appreciated
an
unusual
take
on
a
stout
overall
pretty
bland
would
steer
clear
of
in
the
future
i
just
had
one
bottled
in
november
04
it
had
a
brown
dark
orange
color
and
a
nice
small
head
it
smelled
of
maple
sweetness
with
some
malty
roasted
notes
this
had
quite
complex
flavors
of
maple
chocolate
and
a
nuts
the
sweetness
and
roastiness
of
the
flavor
and
aftertaste
blended
wonderfully
together
as
it
warmed
as
i
neared
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
also
started
to
get
a
nice
warm
feeling
and
then
remembered
its
almost
10
abv
poured
a
dark
brown
body
with
red
coming
through
around
the
edges
had
light
tan
lead
that
left
little
to
no
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
greatly
consisted
of
caramel
and
chocolates
from
the
roasted
malts
it
had
a
big
hit
of
maple
sugar
present
in
both
also
not
a
bad
taste
or
aroma
the
drink
was
relatively
thin
for
a
beer
that
calls
itself
an
imperial
there
was
alcohol
present
but
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
over
whelming
it
wasnt
bad
i
would
get
this
again
but
not
often
i
must
say
i
was
truly
let
down
with
this
one
it
poured
a
quite
cloudy
dark
brownishred
colour
with
a
huge
foamy
khaki
coloured
head
the
smell
was
amazingly
sweet
with
a
powferul
alcohol
punch
the
taste
more
of
the
smell
quite
honestly
with
a
rediculous
amount
of
sugar
and
alcohol
theres
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
maple
syrup
is
involved
in
the
brewing
process
of
this
one
enormously
sweet
and
enormously
alcoholic
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
one
especially
in
such
a
large
serving
this
needs
to
be
an
112oz
bottle
certainly
not
a
22ozer
very
rough
and
quite
strong
i
have
had
brews
11
12
even
15abv
that
were
easier
to
drink
than
this
im
sure
this
has
its
fans
but
i
didnt
care
for
it
thanks
d
very
drinkable
for
a
big
imperial
brown
i
wouldnt
recommend
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
i
will
definitely
look
for
this
one
again
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
an
imperial
nut
brown
ale
and
with
the
brewerys
prominent
notice
that
maple
syrup
was
used
in
the
brew
i
was
braced
for
something
over
the
top
with
sweetness
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
judicious
use
of
the
maple
flavor
in
the
beer
just
enought
to
provide
an
interesting
dimension
but
not
enough
to
overpower
or
even
steal
the
spotlight
nicely
moderated
roasted
malt
flavor
and
the
alcohol
flavor
was
subdued
unusually
drinkable
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
tall
weizen
glass
pours
out
a
dark
rubytinted
brown
with
almost
no
head
despite
a
vigorous
pour
very
sweet
nose
with
rich
toffee
notes
good
malt
flavor
but
not
too
sweet
continuing
the
toffeecaramel
note
with
modest
nutty
flavor
moderate
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
at
the
end
a
faint
greenapple
fruitiness
mixed
with
pleasant
maple
syrup
flavor
become
apparent
surprisingly
light
and
drinkable
for
a
9
8
beer
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
an
overdone
version
of
their
maple
brown
but
its
very
wellbalanced
and
quite
drinkable
and
by
the
bottom
of
the
glass
rather
warming
as
well
a
pleasant
surprise
here
for
certain
very
pleasant
to
taste
and
dangerously
drinkable
drinkability
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
impressive
brew
and
a
style
that
im
glad
they
took
a
chance
on
without
the
thickness
and
insane
complexity
of
an
imperial
stout
this
is
much
more
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
though
i
want
to
savor
it
i
end
up
drinking
it
a
bit
too
fast
and
can
be
a
bit
deadlier
since
the
alcohol
is
still
present
as
much
as
an
imperial
stout
also
im
really
glad
i
tried
this
and
will
hopefully
be
having
some
more
by
tommyknocker
when
i
can
get
my
hands
on
some
wonderful
brew
this
beer
poured
a
dark
red
color
almost
brown
with
a
half
inch
head
that
dissipated
slowly
aroma
was
very
malty
and
caramelly
with
a
few
hints
of
chocolate
in
the
nose
taste
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
maple
syrup
and
chocolate
covered
cherries
as
the
beer
warmed
i
could
taste
some
alcohol
and
winey
flavors
mouthfeel
was
fairly
smooth
and
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
drinkability
was
pretty
high
i
would
have
never
known
this
beer
was
over
9
abv
if
i
hadnt
seen
it
on
this
site
the
abv
is
not
listed
on
the
bottle
and
the
brewerys
website
is
no
longer
available
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
money
i
paid
3
49
for
a
22oz
bomber
this
is
just
a
nutbrown
on
steroids
really
quite
nice
but
not
all
that
tommyknocker
nut
brown
ale
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
small
head
from
a
brown
twenty
two
ounce
bottle
smell
is
dominated
by
malt
tastes
okay
for
a
nut
brown
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
brew
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
worth
a
try
its
not
terribly
complex
but
it
is
definitely
more
drinkable
than
it
probably
should
be
given
the
alcohol
dark
brown
the
deep
aroma
showcases
hints
of
maple
honey
fruits
deep
malts
caramel
and
roasted
malts
i¬íll
have
to
be
honest
and
say
that
i
do
enjoy
the
flavor
it¬ís
fairly
thin
but
it
does
have
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
notes
of
honey
and
caramel
dark
fruits
butter
toffee
maple
and
toasted
malts
tasty
meduim
to
full
bodied
alcohol
is
warming
and
leaves
that
familiar
burning
in
the
throat
no
carbonation
sticky
and
sweet
a
good
beer
overall
this
poured
with
a
thin
wispy
lightbrown
head
the
color
was
a
slightly
cloudy
deep
brown
the
nose
was
very
malty
and
sweet
especially
from
the
maple
syrup
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bordering
on
creamy
it
had
a
great
sweetness
on
the
tongue
and
the
finish
really
lingered
with
the
maple
syrup
aftertaste
my
only
concern
is
that
this
beer
would
be
more
suited
for
dessert
or
a
cold
evening
by
the
fireplace
22
oz
best
within
4
months
of
112105
notched
on
the
label
it
pours
a
deep
almost
blood
red
that
is
hard
to
see
through
and
its
topped
with
a
small
khaki
head
it
has
a
big
aroma
of
chocolate
and
vinous
malts
with
additions
of
toasted
malt
and
grassyperfumy
hops
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
a
good
dose
of
hops
that
contribute
a
mild
to
medium
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thick
and
tingly
at
the
beginning
but
soon
becomes
full
and
coating
probably
the
best
ive
tried
by
the
brewery
and
it
seems
like
how
an
imperial
brown
ale
might
taste
i
actually
just
today
found
another
imperial
brown
ale
by
legend
so
ill
have
something
to
compare
it
against
drinkability
is
not
good
wouldnt
have
again
too
much
alcohol
noticed
why
lots
of
brews
can
hide
or
blend
9
8
or
more
well
enough
beer
is
good
happy
um
brown
beering
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
a
nice
warm
maple
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
victory
malts
its
sweet
and
a
bit
dry
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
warm
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
slow
yet
smooth
its
sweet
with
maple
syrup
notes
and
crystal
malts
it
has
a
nutty
feel
and
seems
a
bit
dry
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
its
rich
and
full
flavored
with
loads
of
malts
and
a
warming
finish
hooray
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
but
a
bit
watery
the
9
8
warms
the
throat
and
back
of
the
tongue
quite
pleasing
a
fine
afterdinner
beer
for
a
cold
day
id
pick
this
one
up
again
i
like
strong
beer

this
is

fairly
sweet

obvious
also
some

minimal

not
my
favorite
type

this
would
be
nice
for
after
dinner
sipping
or
with
a
nutty
desert
not
really
sure
what
to
expect
from
a
lackluster
brewery
with
an
imperial

brown
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
descent
tan
head
that
retains
well
for
a
nearly
10
brew
the
aroma
comes
out
swinging
with

some
almond
and

notes
in
the
background
along
with
some
fruits
cherry
raspberry

slight

even
for
just
a
plain
brown
ale
with
light
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
good
for
the
abv
an
interesting
beer
but
the
finish
was
a
bit
watery
and
the
flavor
didnt
really
deliver
like
i
hoped
but
drinkable
and
tasty
nonetheless

fulfilling
an
aftertaste
of
a
freshly

roll
and
the
smile
of
enjoying
it
this
is
incredible
stuff
probably
wouldnt
search
this
one
out
again
i
was
drawn
to
the
imperial
on
the
label
but
a
decent
quaff
also
one
is
probably
enough
in
a
session
drinkability
if
i
see
this
again
ill
try
it
within
4
months
i
enjoyed
this
beer
if
you
prefer
the
maltier
sweeter
side
of
beer
this
onell
do
you
proper
fairly
light
bodied
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
ill
buy
again
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
doesnt
last
it
did
have
some
beautiful
spiderweb
lacing
though
smell
was
sweet
with
some
nuttiness
the
maple
syrup
that
was
mentioned
on
the
bottle
did
make
it
in
the
smell
but
only
faintly
this
is
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
the
taste
is
dominated
by
sweet
malts
there
is
some
nice
nutty
and
syrupy
taste
to
balance
it
out
my
favorite
part
is
the
warm
alcohol
finish
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
as
tommyknocker
hides
it
well
but
there
is
just
enough
to
give
it
a
very
nice
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
as
the
drinkability
this
certainly
isnt
a
session
brew
because
of
the
sweetness
and
9
8
but
it
is
very
drinkable
one
of
the
most
drinkable
high
abv
beers
iv
had
had
the
bottled
version
of
this
beer
in
a
beer
tasting
event
it
pours
a
nutty
brown
murky
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
but
little
head
that
quickly
disappears
it
a
neat
beer
with
an
unusual
flavor
and
feel
it
has
a
smooth
maple
flavor
that
has
a
zestyness
to
it
due
to
the
carbonation
it¬ís
unusual
and
drinkable
but
a
little
sweet
to
drink
all
the
time
i
would
try
other
beers
from
this
brewery
to
see
if
they
are
as
intriguing
drinkable
enough
i
had
previous
bottles
that
tasted
better
but
maybe
buds
were
altered
from
drinking
other
beers
prior
on
those
occasions
somewhere
between
this
imperial
nut
brown
and
their
regular
brown
is
a
very
good
beer
say
something
between
6
57
5
abv
very
interesting
i
cant
say
id
ever
heard
of
a
brown
ale
being
imperialized
before
im
not
exactly
sure
this
is
the
kind
of
style
that
should
be
imperialized
decent
definitely
drinkable
but
im
not
sure
id
want
another
glad
i
got
to
try
it
quite
drinkable
and
unexpectedly
good
especially
that
i
picked
this
beer
up
for
less
than
2
body
is
huge
thick
chewy
and
sticky
making
me
want
to
lick
my
chops
after
every
sip
i
truly
savor
every
drop
of
this
delicious
and
rather
underrated
ale
yes
this
ale
crosses
many
boundaries
at
times
it
reminds
you
of
a
porter
or
stout
then
barleywine
then
old
ale
in
the
end
you
are
assured
this
is
an
imperial
nut
brown
ale
a
new
animal
yes
and
a
damn
tastey
one
at
that
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
light
brown
head
above
the
clear
burgundy
brown
brew
head
fades
but
some
still
hangs
around
with
lacing
present
and
accounted
for
aroma
is
dark
fruits
alcohol
with
some
grains
lying
underneath
taste
is
upfront
with
heavy
sweetness
the
maple
syrup
i
assume
then
kicking
in
with
the
kind
of
tart
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
and
thats
about
it
and
grains
seem
to
have
lost
the
shouting
match
here
mouthfeel
is
just
too
everything
for
me
and
drinkability
is
reasonably
limited
due
to
the
loudness
of
it
all
i
keep
trying
but
im
thinking
i
certainly
dont
get
these
imperial
browns
they
seem
to
lose
everything
i
like
in
a
brown
this
way
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
would
order
again
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
porterish
with
some
amber
highlights
and
a
short
khaki
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
is
strong
on
the
caramel
sugars
some
spiceyness
and
alcohol
taste
is
similar
to
the
maple
nut
brown
heavy
on
the
maple
light
on
the
nut
but
this
time
also
heavy
on
the
alcohol
which
warms
to
the
point
of
a
hearburnlike
effect
whooo
this
stuff
catches
up
to
you
especially
in
bomber
proportions
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
not
as
thin
as
other
tommyknocker
brews
tend
to
be
overall
a
pretty
good
dark
imperial
brown
here
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
but
enough
to
keep
you
interested
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
but
beware
that
9
8
it
is
fine
fine
fine
maybe
a
bit
one
sided
but
a
strong
hit
wow
a
nut
brown
with
some
serious
body
and
kick
a
heavy
and
viscous
dark
brownblack
pour
with
a
light
brown
head
that
stubbornly
remained
deep
roasted
malt
with
chocolate
undertones
and
a
mellow
souring
pronounced
throughout
tastes
richly
of
molassas
roasted
grain
and
chocolate
little
in
the
way
of
alcohol
flavor
but
warm
throughout
hop
detection
in
the
bittering
flavor
and
dryness
fermented
sour
notes
added
to
complexity
without
detracting
finishes
nutty
and
chocolatey
sweet
with
slight
dryness
worth
a
try
for
nut
brown
and
porter
fans
glad
i
tried
it
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
again
this
imperial
smelled
robust
with
a
definite
chocolaty
nose
poured
very
dark
brown
more
like
a
robust
porter
or
stout
rather
than
a
brown
ale
with
not
much
of
a
head
unless
poured
from
a
height
the
head
lasted
several
minutes
and
produced
some
good
lacing
on
the
glass
first
taste
revealed
a
heavier
alcohol
content
but
not
overpowering
not
much
carbonation
and
tasted
malty
somewhat
chocolaty
with
a
rather
flat
finish
as
the
beer
warmed
the
beer
seemed
to
become
even
milder
and
smoother
although
i
wouldn¬ít
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
more
i
would
definitely
not
turn
another
one
down
if
offered
rather
easy
to
drink
with
very
little
hint
of
the
hidden
alcoholic
strength
at
first
except
some
fuminess
near
room
temperature
after
a
while
a
good
deal
of
warming
in
the
belly
if
i
was
asked
to
sum
it
all
up
i
would
chalk
this
up
as
an
interesting
but
slightly
flawed
experiment
deep
brown
color
with
mahogany
highlights
it
was
topped
with
a
decent
sized
tan
head
it
has
a
very
sweet
aroma
with
caramel
toffee
and
dates
there
is
just
a
touch
o
orange
citrus
in
the
nose
the
taste
has
the
same
sweetness
up
front
toffeecaramel
with
a
chocolaty
character
delivered
by
the
roast
malt
it
finishes
with
the
citrus
orange
delivered
by
the
hops
and
a
mild
alcohol
warming
the
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
and
rich
the
drinakbility
is
hurt
by
the
intense
sweetness
but
this
is
still
an
good
beer
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
brown
with
some
floating
particles
has
a
small
light
brown
head
that
doesnt
last
long
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
chocolate
and
caramel
aromas
chocolate
coffee
nutty
brown
sugar
and
maple
flavors
full
bodied
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
finishes
on
the
sweet
side
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
as
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
after
tasting
tommyknockers
ornery
amber
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
bomber
i
couldnt
resist
buying
it
though
since
i
was
curious
about
an
imperial
nut
brown
made
with
maple
syrup
and
since
the
price
was
right
imperial
nut
brown
ale
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
i
heartily
recommend
to
lovers
of
all
things
imperial
and
lovers
of
good
beer
in
general
drinkability
overall
less
pleasurable
than
the
regular
version
the
extra
bite
was
a
little
offensive
and
detracted
from
the
already
lessthanoutstanding
original
only
exceeds
its
predecessor
in
appearance
dark
brown
maroon
color
almost
light
impenetrable
but
shows
a
very
dark
maple
syrup
color
head
is
very
small
just
a
ring
around
the
glass
with
an
offwhite
island
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
smell
is
sweet
and
full
with
alcohol
and
brown
sugar
this
is
very
much
like
a
great
winter
warmer
maybe
even
a
dopple
bock
even
though
it
is
june
taste
is
extremely
malty
and
full
lots
of
sweetness
rich
and
delicous
for
2
50
a
bomber
this
stuff
is
a
steal
very
good
unique
and
a
welcome
surprise
from
a
brewery
that
just
entered
the
twin
cities
market
my
first
imperial
nut
brown
and
i
like
the
style
22
oz
capped
and
wrapped
with
gold
foil
hmm
heres
an
interesting
style
not
one
ive
ever
really
seen
for
that
matter
pours
a
dark
brown
minimal
head
smell
is
sweet
malty
taste
isnt
quite
as
complex
as
i
expected
for
the
elegant
packaging
and
the
fact
that
its
a
10th
anniversary
beer
chocolate
maple
syrup
caramel
and
some
vanilla
along
with
a
nutty
flavor
are
present
tons
of
alcohol
is
there
as
well
quite
unbalanced
somewhat
warming
though
so
itd
probably
be
better
on
a
winters
day
its
not
a
horrible
beer
but
not
as
interesting
as
i
expected
at
4
49
a
bomber
its
not
a
bargain
nor
a
ripoff
as
someone
said
its
a
take
it
or
leave
it
beer
i
could
live
without
another
one
of
these
not
horrible
but
nothing
special
about
it
take
it
or
leave
it
type
of
beer
deep
crimson
tone
slight
bubbly
light
brown
head
lacing
is
moderate
aroma
is
sweet
nutty
and
toasty
chocolate
and
caramel
are
also
present
really
quite
a
pleasant
nose
with
no
overriding
characteristic
when
i
read
that
this
was
a
jacked
up
version
of
their
normal
maple
nut
brown
ale
i
feared
this
was
going
to
be
too
sweet
but
thats
not
the
case
its
sweet
but
not
cloying
the
maple
is
noticeable
as
is
chocolate
alcohol
lets
itself
be
heard
as
well
theres
a
little
heat
to
this
one
nuttiness
and
lightly
kilned
malts
meld
nicely
together
its
good
not
great
in
this
particular
beer
i
could
do
without
the
jacke
up
etoh
level
but
thats
just
my
preference
all
in
all
its
pretty
decent
im
not
sure
if
this
is
infused
with
any
extracts
but
this
becomes
cloying
at
times
pretty
good
and
tasty
on
the
whole
but
on
the
other
hand
not
so
nutty
and
there
arent
many
undertones
or
complexities
that
i
was
expecting
from
a
beer
which
celebrates
10
years
imperial
nut
brown
ale
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
wont
fit
into
a
clearly
defined
catagory
the
aroma
of
this
one
reminds
me
of
redhots
cinnamon
candy
with
some
added
features
of
course
there
was
a
distinct
peppery
flavor
in
the
middle
of
this
overall
id
put
this
somewhere
between
a
double
ipa
and
a
barleywine
stylewyse
this
ones
worth
a
shot
pours
out
of
the
22oz
bottle
a
deeply
ruby
hued
colour
with
a
cream
to
beige
coloured
head
about
a
quarter
inch
thick
thick
and
tight
lots
of
solvent
choco
and
caramel
aromas
somewhat
subdued
but
rather
inviting
this
is
a
pretty
flavourful
beer
lots
of
thick
chewy
maltiness
with
a
definite
sweetness
attributed
to
the
use
of
maple
syrup
chocolate
caramel
vanilla
and
nutty
notes
mingle
quite
nicely
with
an
alcohol
spice
that
warms
the
belly
there
is
a
big
full
mouthfeel
with
every
sip
i
bet
this
would
go
well
with
some
chocolate
chip
pancakes
or
maybe
serve
as
the
syrup
for
those
cakes
nevertheless
this
is
a
big
ole
winter
warmer
type
concoction
that
is
a
hearty
enough
brew
to
warm
ones
soul
on
the
coldest
of
any
winter
night
not
overly
complex
just
big
and
sweet
and
hearty
a
nice
easy
sipping
brew
for
being
so
big
this
is
a
big
oafish
simple
being
but
a
fairly
tasty
one
the
best
tommyknocker
brew
ive
had
so
far
a
very
nice
imperial
nut
brown
i
would
buy
this
one
again
pours
a
dark
maple
syrup
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
rather
small
half
a
finger
of
sandy
brown
head

is
made
up
of
sweet
licorice
malts
singed
brown
sugar
a
vaguely
spicy
hop
smell
and
a
little
alcohol
taste
starts
with
sweetish
malts
notes
of
marshmallow
tobacco
leaf
stewed
fruit
and
cola
are
detectable
bitterness
comes
late
basically
right
at
the
finish
unfortunately
the
light
roasted
bitterness
falls
a
little
short
and
the
result
leans
toward
a
cloying
finish
not
bad
but
could
use
a
little
more
balance
mediumfull
body
with
ample
carbonation
i
like
this
more
than
any
other
tommyknocker
beer
ive
had
22

some

reviewed
from
a
22oz
bottle
sampled
on
1805
with
a
bottled
on
date
of
110904
appears
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
and
a
small

aroma
is
malt
with
sweetness
and
a
chocolate
a
big

as
well
as
a
touch
of
maple
flavor
is
quite
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
and
chocolate
there
are
nut
flavors
in
there
as
well
but
this
is
a
bit
too
sweet
overall
a
little
less
sweet
would
have
gone
a
long
way
with
this
medium
body
with
a
creamy
feel
to
it
only
the
sweetness
brings
down
the
drinkability
on
this
otherwise
it
would
really
be
a
much
better
beer
the
beer
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
color
with
off

frothy
head
of
1
cm
foaming
up
and
fading
gradually
to
a
robust

remains
throughout

aroma
is
caramel
maple

and
alomonds
some
lite
grassy
hops
also
make
an
appearance
first
sip
reveals
gentle
rolling
carbonation
and
a
smooth

with
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
texture
flavor
is

and
general
sweetness
with
toffee
maple

brown
sugar
all
mixing
for
an
overall
sweet
experience
the
finish
is
very
maplely
and
also
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
the
is
a
nice
brew
but
gets
a
little
sweet
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
contrary
to
some
other
reviews
i
barely
find
any
presence
of
the
alcohol
flavor
wise
or
on
the
nose
very
drinkable
for
a
bigger
beer
much
better
than
the
maple

good
session
ale
despite
the
abv
a
nice
surprise
from
a
normally
belowaverage
brewer
22oz
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
but
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
from
the
maple
syrup
and
has
a
lot
of
alcohol
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
character
from
the
maple
syrup
but
the
alcohol
really
hurts
the
flavor
here
very
thick
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
ok
but
suffers
from
the
unmasked
alcohol
thanks
to
clvand0
for
sharing
this
with
me
the
beer
pours
a
very
deep
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
very
lightly
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
slightly
brown
sugar
and
maple
sweet
with
a
blas
of
alcohol
as
well
the
flavor
is
nice
with
good
toasted
nutty
tones
alongside
sweet
maple
and
brown
sugar
though
there
is
an
intial
alcohol
that
detracts
a
little
from
the
flavor
the
beer
is
very
thick
and
slightly
syrupy
a
very
enjoyable
drink
if
it
werent
for
the
fairly
big
alcohol
hit
in
the
flavor
this
would
be
very
good
though
it
is
still
not
bad
this
imperial
nut
brown
is
both
¬ìbigger
bolder¬î
as
advertised
but
in
my
opinion
it
could
use
some
tweaking
here
and
there
do
i
think
that
a
new
style
definition
is
required
i¬ím
not
sure
i
can
answer
that
at
this
time
it
depends
on
how
many
other
brewers
want
to
take
this
¬ìimperial¬î
craze
to
supplementary
styles
other
than
the
stout
or
i
p
a
we¬íre
generally
accustomed
to
delicious
brown
ale
made
with
hemp
has
an
earth
taste
that
was
enjoyed
very
much
very
smooth
very
different
from
anything
i
had
before
the
color
looked
like
a
standard
brown
ale
and
there
wasnt
a
really
distinct
smell
from
what
i
could
gather
taste
wasnt
bad
but
isnt
something
i
would
crave
a
lot
good
beer
to
mix
it
up
with
but
not
something
i
would
consistently
buy
worth
buying
if
you
want
to
try
something
unique
for
the
most
part
im
generally
disappointed
with
american
brown
ales
no
exception
here
either
i
really
hate
the
taste
of
hemp
or
this
is
just
a
bad
beer
bitter
with
a
poor
mix
of
hops
and
malt

overall
3

this
brown
has
hop
presence
theres
no
denying
that
its
a
good
beer
overall
i
dont
think
im
swayed
enough
to
buy
a
six
pack
but
it
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
would
have
it
again
if
offered
3
035
if
nothing
else
a
good
fat
tire
alternative
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
woody
hops
with
raisinlike
taste
from
the
malt
and
yeast
mixing
with
a
strange
herbal
element
that
comes
of
as
nutty
and
slightly
earthy
with
subtle
figlike
aspect
which
is
more
like
dark
toffee
but
not
that
sweet
the
flavor
has
a
mild
yeast
taste
i
cant
place
or
perhaps
it
is
the
hemp
overall
i
like
this
but
would
probably
not
get
this
again
there
are
many
brown
ales
i
prefer
to
this
in
the
same
abv
range
o
2012
bottle
probably
past
prime
revisited
with
fresh
bottle
in
nov
2014
rating
upgraded
overall
i
really
enjoyed
all
of
the
malts
and
chocolate
notes
on
this
tasty
but
not
really
a
bold
brown
ale
partially
due
to
expectations

a

offering
o
okay
works
well
to
describe
this
one
nothing
is
offensive
or
particularly
good
so
i
didnt
mind
drinking
it
but
also
wasnt
particularly
enthused
o
its
drinkable
in
its
mildness
but
could
use
a
flavor
boost
there
is
something
like
a
dry
chocolate
or
rather
carob
flavor
some
odd
sweetness
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
this
seems
well
made
but
the
taste
gets
a
little
tiresome
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
either
the
crispness
of
a
more
refreshing
beer
or
the
roasted
malt
of
the
better
browns
from
the
12

overall
nicely

i
cannot
say
that
the
hemp
changes
it
too
much
maybe
i
just
dont
know
what
im
looking
for
but
it
certainly
does
not
take
anything
away
from
it
o
i
have
no
idea
what
hemp
actually
tastes
like
but
it
didnt
add
much
flavor
or
aroma
to
this
brew
not
a
bad
brown
ale
but
nothing
rememberable
decent
malt
complexity
but
lacking
a
bit
in
hops
for
the
style
the
fruity
notes
were
a
bit
offputting
not
a
big
cola
fan
either
theres
a
bit
too
much
spritz
but
otherwise
the
medium
body
holds
together

recall
having
a

and
wondering
the
similar
thoughthemp
doesnt
seem
to
alter
much
overall
a
pleasant
easydrinking
brew
that
has
little
in

it
is
a
brown
after
all
and
yet
its
promise
to
be

doesnt
quite
pan
out

for

point
about
right
the
aftertaste
is
not
particularly
outstanding
so
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
o
a
solid
brown

but
nothing
exciting
still
for
the

its
fairly
welldone
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
grab
a
couple
more
if
im
ever
in
the
mood
overall
not
my
type
of
flavours
found
in
a
beer
but
it
still
tastes
well
crafted
and
interesting
it
has
a
touch
too
many
earthy
notes
for
me
but
still
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
yet
still
can
see
a
bit
of
light
coming
through
this
beer
some
head
at
pour
disappates
to
almost
nothing
with
no

aroma
reveals
some
earthy

grass
no
pun
intended
and
dirt
on
the
good
side
flavor
is
mild
and
not
as
interesting
with
a
mostly
consistent
flavor
from
front
to
back
relatively
light
the
metallic
and
vegetable
taste
did
not
work
for
me
this
ale
brewed
with
hemp
isnt
to
bad
sort
of
tastes
like
a
slightly
washed
out
newcastle
or
something
along
those
lines
i
dont
know
what
the
purpose
of
adding
hemp
but
what
the
heck
give
it
a
try
odnot
a
fan
of
this
one
at
all
d
not
bad
it
is
pretty
standard
brown
ale
with
a
decent
malt
presence
and
a
pronounced
nutty
character
presumably
from
the
hemp
overall
i
wish
that
there
were
more
hemp
in
this
if
this
had
been
billed
as
a
garden
variety
brown
ale
i
think
i
mightve
like
it
a
little
more
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
its
worth
a
try
o
very
drinkable
but
certainly
not
very
exciting
and
if
youre
looking
for
something
that
comes
even
a
little
bit
close
to
tasting
like
marijuana
steer
clear
of
this
one
poured
out
as
an
average
looking
brown
color
good
clarity
and
a
white
fizzy
head
the
retention
was
minimal
as
well
as
the
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
some
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
coffee
and
an
herbal
note
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
lightly
roasted
its
got
a
subtle
chocolate
flavor
as
well
as
a
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
light
decent
carbonation
with
a
soft
creamy
finish
to
it
overall
its
not
a
bad
brown
ale
its
not
the
best
but
its
still
worth
trying
this
beer
is
a

i
am
not

what

to
taste

this
just
tastes

very
drinkable
nice

mix

not
as
thick
as
it
initially

not
a

brews
just
because
a

of
them
seem
to
be
too
meaty
after
one
beer
the
sound
of

doesnt
sound
too
appetizing
but
humboldt
brown
is
actually
very
light
the
top
note
still
has
that
classic
brown
ale
flavor

it
dissipates
into
a
very
smooth

an
equally

roasted

and

a

slight

slightly
fruity
taste
with
an
abrupt
finish
with
slight
hops
a
light
earthy
interesting
flavor
in
the
background
but
it
stays
far
enough
away
to
not
catch
my
interest
kind
of
boring
really
adequate
overall
its
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
unless
my
options
were
severely
limited
the
beer
is
amber
quite
dark
and
on
top
of
it
a
good
beige
foamy
head
dense
and
sticky
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
hops
piny
some
caramel
malts
too
i
notice
also
some
roasted
malts
good
the
taste
i
get
some
nuts
hazelnuts
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
refreshing
and
very
sessionable
this
one
i
would
buy
quite
often
for
day
to
day
drinking
a
good
beer
overall
not
boring
just
not
interesting
enough
to
write
home
about
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
theres
nothing
overly
special
about
the
taste
overall
im
pleased
with
this
beer
the
thick
creamy
taste
is
backed
up
with
roasted
malt
and
nutty
flavor
i
didnt
notice
many
hoppy
characteristics
but
this
is
a
brown
ale
so
im
looking
for
more
of
a
malty
flavor
o
not
sure
the
malt
hops
and
adjuncts
really
worked
together
on
this
o
fairly
average
for
the
style
o
i
honestly
avoided
this
beer
for
quite
a
while
because
i
didnt
want
to
drink
a
glass
of
marijuana
this
was
pretty
good
though
great
taste
all
the
way
thru
the
beer
just
what
a
brown
should
be
nutty
quality
o
a
decent
beer
one
ill
probably
not
revisit
but
would
certainly
drink
if
it
was
handed
to
me
pretty
average
brown
ale
wheres
the
hemp
pours
a
slightly
heady
clear
brown
color
that
smells
like
a
light
chocolate
malt
and
some
agricultural
produce
earthy
and
mild
tastes
like
a
basic
brown
ale
with
a
bit
of
organic
matter
not
composty
per
se
but
not
hempy
either
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
only
moderately
carbonated
not
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
brews
this
one
didnt
amaze
me
o
this
brew
is
pretty
uninspiring
and
has
some
weird
things
going
on
too
many
other
good
browns
out
there
dark
brown
pour
with
a
lighter
brown
head
to
it
sticky
lace
was
left
all
the
way
down
the
glass
nice
roasted
aroma
in
the
nose
malts
mostly
prevalent
along
with
some
light
cocoa
notes
a
little
something
extra
at
the
end
that
makes
you
wonder
what
the
taste
will
be
like
at
first
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
roasted
malts
slight
cocoa
and
coffee
flavors
mix
well
together
earthy
taste
to
it
with
a
bit
of
spice
dotted
here
and
there
the
spice
comes
out
a
little
more
at
the
end
with
a
decent
hop
bitterness
not
sure
what
the
spice
is
but
meshed
well
with
the
other
flavors
to
create
an
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
and
would
have
another
if
the
opportunity
arose
not
a
bad
american
brown
starts
slow
but
comes
around
not
the
strongest
brew
ive
had
from
these
guys
servicable
absolutely
a
masterpiece
nope
pours
deep
coppery
brown
with
a
mediocre
head
the
aroma
is
slight
and
woody
the
flavor
is
thin
with
a
woody
brown
sugar
flavor
that
fades
away
essentially
to
nothing
the
finish
is
watery
with
a
faint
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
watery
the
taste
is
malty
and
bready
with
a
small
hop
bite
in
the
middle
caramel
malts
give
it
a
balanced
sweetness
up
front
while
the
breadiness
comes
through
in
the
back
end
mostly
giving
it
a
full
body
almost
too
full
for
the
style
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
probably
from
the
hemp
adds
a
bit
of
character
to
a
sort
of
bland
brown
ale
somewhat
creamy
in
the
feel
in
the
back
but
tingly
on
the
top
of
the
tongue
definitely
leaves
and
unwanted
and
lingering
mouthfeel
that
actually
makes
the
experience
much
less
enjoyable
it
seems
to
be
the
main
problem
with
a
decent
beer
definitely
docking
points
in
my
book
overall
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
worth
a
try
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
a
latticework
of
lace
lines
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
slight
cocoa
and
coffee
aromas
and
a
nutty
quality
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
roasted
nuts
cocoa
powder
and
slight
coffee
beans
a
nice
roasty
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
some
nice
roasty
and
earthy
flavors
i
tried
this
a
while
ago
in
the
bottle
and
didnt
care
for
it
too
much
but
on
tap
this
is
most
excellent
overall
a
refreshing
brown
both
in
taste
and
in
being
a
different
player
in
a
tried
and
true
field
again
this
beer
really
is
close
to
style
with
all
of
the
elements
of
a
solid
brown
beer
however
the
tweaks
on
the
formula
a
noticeable
hop
profile
part
of
which
perhaps
coming
from
the
hemp
and
altered
body
in
taste
and
feel
are
worth
a
go
really
enjoyed
this
one
standard
brown
ale
flavors
dominatelot
of

light
carbonationwith
a
bit
of
what
i
am
guessing
is
a
hemp
aftertaste
not
entirely
sure
as
its
not
hoppy
but
theres
definitely
a
distinct
flavor
that
comes
across
in
the
finish
drinkable
enjoyed
it
as
a
shared
bottle
but
otherwise
just
there
no
complaints
nor
cause
for
celebration
the
hemp
must
add
a
certain
complexity
to
the
herbal
and
maybe
even
spicelike
effect
enjoyable
brown
overall
a
good
beer
if
someone
really
enjoys
hemp
beer
this
is
one
i
would
say
give
it
a
try
overall
nice
little
brown
ale
i
truly
think
that
is
one
style
that
it
is
hard
to
make
good
but
this
one
is
pretty
close
overall
impression
how
can
you
pass
up
a
tap
handle
that
has
a
marijuana
leaf
on
the
front
of
it
had
to
have
i
did
feel
that
it
not
only
didnt
have
enough
body
behind
it
it
also
was
weak
and
could
have
used
more
ingredients
sweet
malty
and
had
good
tastes
but
lacked
some
im
not
dissing
this
brew
by
any
means
but
just
simply
wouldnt
go
back
to
it
o
decent
brown
ale
glad
i
tried
it
may
have
to
drink
one
on
a
cooler
night
humboldt
brown
pours
out
a
clear
brownishorange
hue
with
a
light
head
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
deeply
earthy
and
exceptionally
unique
true
to
the
american
brown
ale
style
this
is
a
richly
malty
beer
you
get
a
nice
blend
of
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
that
play
nicely
with
the
toasty
quality
that
the
hemp
seeds
add
to
the
beer
on
the
swallow
you
get
a
snap
of
hops
that
lingers
throughout
the
drink
overall
this
is
a
sturdy
brown
ale
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
slightly
red
brown
that
was
slightly
translucent
a
one
finger
bubbly
head
appeared
that
didnt
cling
and
only
lasted
for
a
few
moments
aroma
was
a

acidic
with
definite
hints
of
a
milk
chocolate
and
a

of

bread
taste
was

with

felt
ok
in

tingled
the
tongue
a
bit
much
for
my
liking
coated
well
but
just
felt
a
little
thin
at
time
with
just
a
tad
of
carbonation
could
be
felt
overall
a
reasonable
brown
fairly
solid
middle
of
the
road
3

d
if
they
upped
the
mash
temp
of
this
by
a
good
4
or
5
degrees
this
could
be
a
very
good
beer
nose
and
taste
are
both
pretty
good
i
just
want
more
of
it
dry
and
husky
grain
toasty
and
mellow
pretty
easy
going
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lighter
body
residual
dry

pretty
smooth
and
not
bitter
lingering
toasted
malts
in
the
aftertaste
dry
but
fairly
pleasant
whatever
hemp
seed
is
in
here
it
doesnt
lend
much
some
woodyearthy
flavors
perhaps
but
it
would
be
hard
to
pick
out
and
isolate
from
the
dominant
malt
flavors
overall
not
too
bad
a
fairly
simple
but
decent
brown
ale
simplicity
is
underrated
o
overall
true
to
brown
ale
style
i
hadnt
realised
this
was
a
brown
ale
from
passing
it
by
on
the
shelf
at
albertsons
however
it
was
on
sale
and
a
closer
look
revealed
it
was
infact
a
brown
ale
and
not
the
pale
ale
one
might
think
of
with
a
green
cardboard
cutout
so
since
i
usually
like
browns
i
decided
to
try
it
out
looked
pretty
thin
not
a
lot
of
head
on
the
beer
slight
hempness
smell
though
not
like
the
weed
smell
you
get
from
some
green
bottles
more
of
a
foresty
smell
flavor
was
not
good
and
not
bad
just
rather
lacking
made
me
wonder
why
they
called
it
a
brown
ale
this
one
does
go
down
pretty
easily
but
thats
about
it
not
much
flavor
to
speak
of
and
hardly
a
brown
ale
overall
i
wont
be
getting
this
beer
again
it
simply
isnt
a
pleasurable
experience
will
i
drink
it
again
yes
because
there
are
still
four
left
in
the
six
pack
was
it
worth
the
money
at
12
not
a
chance
pleasant
enoughtheres
light
cocoa
malt
flavor
some
balancing
bitterness
relatively
mild
flavored
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
the
carbonation
average
the
aftertaste
is
more
bitter
than
the
taste
i
dont
quite
know
where
the
hemp
came
into
play
in
this
one
it
just
seems
like
a
subpar
nut
brown
ale
to
me
overall
pretty
tasty
decent
brown
ale
a
nice
brown
ale
with
a
good
balance
of
rich
flavors
unique
flavors
from
what
must
be
the
hemp
worth
trying
for
anyone
overall
a
good
session
beer
that
would
not
sound
any
taste
alarms
to
the
presence
of
hemp
it
would
seem
almost
watery
body
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
session
although
some
flavor
makes
up
for
the
lack
of
body
overall
not
bad
nothing
special
some
weird
bitter
and
mineral
flavors
i
think
from
the
hemp
could
have
been
a
bit
maltier
decent
bit
of
briny
minerality
this
is
an
underrated
beer
and
i
hope
to
see
more
hemp
ales
maybe
combined
with
different
styles
such
as
a
pale
ale
or
india
pale
ale
so
the
hemp
flavors
stand
out
more
i
understand
why
they
chose
a
brown
ale
to
showcase
the
hemp
seeds
because
the
nutty
grassy
flavor
they
seem
to
give
off
blend
in
perfectly
with
the
roasted
chocolate
caramel
malts
highly
recommended
fairly
easy
drinking
brown
ale
overall
enjoyable
with
flavorful
caramel
malt
being
the
highlight
but
not
outstanding
pours
clear
dark
amber
color
134
inch
head
of
an

color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
hops
sweet
malt
slight
citrus
hops
hint
of
toffee
slight
roasted
malt
and
hint
of
pine
fits
the
style
of
an
american
brown
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
hops
hint
of
alcohol
slight
toffee
and
a
hint
of
spice
overall
good
aroma
and
body
the
body
is
subtle
but
the
blend
and
complexity
make
it
a
good
beer
o
a
gimmick
maybe
but
its
reasonably
good
session
drinking
none
the
less
i
like
how
incredibly
different
nectars
humboldt
brown
is
and
that
it
all
kind
of
comes
together
is
this
something
ill
reach
for
often
no
but
ill
certainly
recommend
others
give
it
a
shot
o
very
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
brown
ale
will
for
sure
get
some
more
to
keep
around
o
overall
a
good
brown
ale
slightly
above
average
would
have
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
ale
yet
wouldnt
seek
out
overall
this
is
a
great
tasting
brown
ale
to
be
drinking
would
have
again
no
problem
good
stuff
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
overall
pleasant
tasty
unexceptional
take
home
scale
id
leave
this
one
on
the
shelf
o
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
easy
drinking
and
tasty
d
overall
a
nice
brown
but
i
really
find
a
pine
hop
flavor
not
too
much
hemp
but
i
expect
this
just
adds
to
overall
texture
d
meh
this
was
mediocre
at
best
nothing
in
here
really
separates
this
from
the
other
examples
of
this
style
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
and
im
glad
i
opted
for
the
single
and
not
a
full
sixer
dont
bother
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
worthy
of
a
try
drinkability
finally
tried
it
but
could
honestly
take
it
or
leave
it
really
nothing
too
special
with
the
base
plus
the
hemp
addition
was
a
weakness
rather
than
an
asset
not
a
bad
beer
here
it
has
some
things
going
on
poured
into
a
tumbler
pint
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
head
that
reaches
the
top
or
the
glass
and
dissipates
fairly
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
dark
malts
and
hops
present
in
the
nose
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
a
hempy
flavor
not
too
strong
and
a
tinge
of
metal
with
a
nice
roasty
aftertaste
id
say
the
beer
has
moderate
body
and
is
a
good
example
of
a
brown
ale
i
like
this
beer
i
dont
know
what
the
hemp
really
adds
to
it
but
if
nothing
else
it
makes
for
some
nice
conversation
very
light
and
drinkable
with
some
nice
twists
on
the
usual
brown
ale
formula
doesnt
come
across
as
excessively
hempy
but
its
presence
is
definitely
notable
and
makes
for
a
nice
brew
d
its
a
light
feeling
beer
but
the
taste
wouldnt
bring
me
back
for
another
two
fingers
of
nicely
frothy
deep
tan
foam
mostly
larger
bubbles
yet
has
decent
retention
more
sheets
of
lacing
than
streaks
you
can
see
it
slowly
slide
uniformly
downwards
light
gauziness
deepens
the
otherwise
clear

but
not
flavor
the
carbonation
is
not
that
big
but
arguably
higher
than
needed
given
the
lightness
of
the
flavors
smooth
texture
and
easy
to
quaff
but
wheres
the
beef
drinkability
is
good
especially
because
of
the
low
abv
d
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
again
just
like
i
wouldnt
drink
the
hemp
ale
again
it
just
isnt
the
same
as
the
real
thing
pours
a
crystal
clear
brown
color
with
a
small
tight
khaki
colored
head
the
aroma
is
of
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
an
herbal
spice
has
a
bit
of
a
multigrain
bread
aroma
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
brown
sugar
sweetness
which
is
quickly
cut
off
by
a
ropey
herbal
note
and
lemony
twang
has
a
bunch
of
tea
like
flavors
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
pleny
of
fizzy
carbonation
sweet
to
start
but
finishes
slightly
tart
too
much
of
a
lemony
tea
characteristic
to
this
brew
for
a
brown
ale
the
malt
profile
is
soso
and
the
brew
is
a
touch
over
carbonated
it
does
drink
quite
easy
rich
ruby
red
color
with
a
oneinch
white
frothy

dissipates
fairly
quickly
tastes
like

beer
almost

creamy
and
fizzy
mouthfeel
more
like
a
sweet
soft
drink
than
an
ale
overall
pleasant
and
distinct
not
bad
for
a
gimmick
beer
worth
trying
once
no
reason
to
try
again
pours
a
fairlydark

a
light

the
nose
is
a
bit
of
light
brown
malt
with
some
brown

and
a

the
taste
is
mostly
malt
that
is
slightly
bready
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
pretty
good
feel
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
special
d
im
not
a
big
brown
ale
fan
and
im
thinking
that
this
is
just
another
brown
in
my
book
which
it
is
but
i
still
like
it
so
i
hope
this
company
makes
it
to
philly
soon
what
are
you
guysgals
waiting
for
d
the
look
threw
me
off
on
this
but
the
drink
is
good
i
would
never
buy
this
again
im
glad
i
was
able
to
pick
up
a
single
bottle
of
it
for
1
30
so
okay
i
did
pick
this
up
because
the
ale
brewed
with
hemp
seemed
like
a
cool
novelty
something
to
check
out
at
least
once
and
i
like
it
but
all
ill
do
is
once
because
other
than
the
earthy
herbal
qualities
on
the
tongue
which
are
pretty
enjoyable
despite
their
lack
of
staying
power
the
plant
doesnt
really
differentiate
this
very
much
from
other
everyday
browns
mixed
feelings
for
sure
this
is
what
i
would
hope
for
from
a
beer
like
this
a
solid
base
beer
flavor
and
a
smack
of
hemp
worth
trying
if
youre
into
trying
new
things
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
i
still
wouldnt
categorize
this
as
a
session
beer
i
remembered
in
california
backcountry
last
year
and
trying
this
for
the
first
time
the
vibe
of
the
region
seemed
to
be
perfectly
reflected
in
this
beer
it
wont
win
any
awards
but
it
has
nothing
to
hide
and
is
pretty
easygoing
like
the
other
nectar
ales
that
ive
tried
this
shows
what
a
nicely
crafted
brew
is
capable
of
and
is
worth
a
go
once
because
there
isnt
anything
out
there
quite
like
this
and
the
leaving
falls
church
uberbender
continues
to
proclaim
its
greatness
this
conspirator
pours
a
clear
ruby
brown
topped
by
a
finger
of
shortlived
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
brown
sugar
very
light
sugarfree
maple
syrup
graham
crackers
and
a
touch
of
flowers
the
taste
is
similar
though
the
brown
sugar
doesnt
stick
and
water
pervades
everything
else
the
proceedings
are
too
fluid
to
allow
the
buds
to
really
savor
anything
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
an
okay
brown
at
best
too
light
and
watery
to
really
maintain
anything
drinkability
an
average
brown
ale
at
best
the
hemp
helps
make
the
beer
super
dry
while
present
towards
the
end
this
really
does
not
distinguish
itself
i
will
pass
in
the
future
taste

a
little
flat

some
sour

a

based
beer
residual
which
was
a

style
by

the
hemp
was
no
doubt
a
marketing
gimmick
which
truly
lends
little
if
any
to
the
overall
factor
of
the
drink
like
mentioned
earlier
a
marketing
gimmick
that
will
ensure
that
if
you
brought
a
sixpack
over
to
a
party
will
no
doubt
gather
the
interest
of
all
the
pot
heads
willing
to
help
you
drink

evidently
dont
know
the

the

what

i
cant
comment
on
how
much
of
a
hemp
character
this
beer
exhibits
balanced
drinkable
sessionable
and
quite
pleasant
brown
id
like
to
try
this
one
as
the

for
a

of
the
moderate

and
earthy

nice
new

overall
an

on
the
brown

some
research
reveals
that
hemp
has
only
about
0

compared
to
marijuanas

so
no

its

i
would

to
have
this

i
like
that
this
beer
was
not
too
sweet
and
that
the
bitterness
lingered
not
in
excess
but
enough
to
keep
me
drinking
it
it
has
this
lagerlike
clean
flavor
making
it
less
interesting
perhaps
but
at
the
same
time
almost
sessionable
worth
a
try
drinkability
this
isnt
the
most
exciting
ale
out
there
but
it
showcases
the
hemp
seed
well
and
is
nicely
balanced
im
sure
ill
be
buying
this
again
overall
a
decent
brown

nothing

not

brew
over
this
one
full
and
rich
mouthfeel
nice
and
creamy
tasty
and
drinkable
thanks
to
barleywinefiend
for
sharing
drinkability
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
the
lady
kept
giving
us
free
pitchers
overall
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
that
certainly
has
nothing
disagreeable
about
it
but
im
not
sure
i
would
order
this
again
had
this
about
a
week
ago
after
work
poured
a
reddish
brown
color
with
little
pearl
head
that
left
a
small
amount
of
lacing
smelled
of
malt
and
fruity
yeast
tasted
of
deep
malts
and
fruit
smooth
but
a
bit
fizzy
could
drink
if
it
was
the
only
option
but
probably
wont
reach
for
this
one
at
the
store
again
i
wouldt
session
this
beer
almost
to
rich
of
a
flavor
after
two
or
three
the
hemp
ale
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
foam
head
or
lacing
the
smell
was
of
spice
and
malt
the
taste
was
pretty
well
balanced
as
far
as
it
being
a
malt
all
the
way
beer
with
a
slight
tinge
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
it
was
lightly
carbonated
and
you
felt
a
little
on
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
a
pretty
middle
of
the
road
brew
something
tells
me
this
beer
does
better
than
it
would
do
otherwise
because
of
its
name
and
its
gimmick
theres
certainly
no
noticeable
impact
from
its
supposed
adjuncts
and
while
its
not
an
unpleasant
brew
to
drink
its
certainly
quite
dull
tastes
like
it
smells
in
that
there
just
isnt
a
whole
lot
going
on
finishes
with
a
bit
of
chili
powderred
pepper
nonetheless
to
call
this
an
herbedspiced
beer
seems
a
bit
of
a
stretch
there
is
no
hemp
in
here
and
hop
presence
is
minimal
spice
consists
of
a
subtle
pepper
heat
thin
in
body
and
offering
moderate
drinkability
a
bit
sweet
and
viscous
with
little
carbonation
i
was
surprised
by
the
dark
redamber
color
nice
offwhitetan
head
initial
taste
reminds
me
of
a
brown
ale
and
malty
then
the
carbonation
comes
in
which
helps
but
finishes
poor
for
me
sour
carmel
lingering
a
bit
too
long
tastes
fine
at
first
then
leaves
me
disappointed
only
because
i
really
enjoy
humboldt
brewing
companys
other
brews
so
much
drinkability
pretty
good
interesting
to
try
it
at
least
once
but
i
could
think
of
many
other
beers
in
the
same
class
with
higher
drinkability
decent
beer
im
probably
drawn
to
it
more
by
the
name
than
anything
else
sweet
taste
followed
by
some
hops
but
pretty
thin
this
tastes
like
a
macro
brewed
version
of
a
beer
that
desperately
wants
to
be
micro
brewed
overall
just
decent
nothing
special
its
what
an
amber
light
might
taste
like

drinkability
hemp
ale
was
better
than
i
expected
though
id
never
know
it
was
brewed
with
something
distinct
unless
it
was
spelled
out
the
hemp
failed
to
deliver
something
unique
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
but
it
does
make
for
good
drinking
its
a
wellbalanced
beer
i
think
ill
burn
a
little
nag
for
the
hell
of
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
not

glad
i
got
to

good
for
a
one
time
review
but
nothing
great
tap
clocktower
in
mammoth
pours
murky
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
dank
malty
aroma
with
the
noticeable
vegetablehemp
aroma
same
goes
for
the
taste
big
caramel
malt
flavors
mixed
with
peppery
hops
the
strawvegetablehemp
flavor
is
throughout
but
doesnt
really
add
anything
in
a
positive
way
to
conclude
an
enjoyable
beer
that
will
surprise
you
if
you
expect
anything
related
to
the
name
a
smooth
crisp
drink
with
a
bit
of
an
afterbite
good
in
moderation
overall
better
then
a
macro
but
not
much
more
then
that
d
honestly
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
would
have
this
beer
again
but
not
something
i
would
break
my
neck
to
find
overalldecent
the
taste
is
almost
porterlike
in
a
way
dark
toasted
bread
with
leaves
a
little
chocolate
light
hoppyherbal
bitterness
and
hint
of
grain
its
smooth
and
mellow
but
blurred
very
soft
and
subdued
and
halfway
through
becomes
tiresome
i
could
see
how
someone
might
like
it
but
its
not
really
my
type
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
novelty
item
to
say
the
least
the
flavor
tends
to
get
old
after
a
while
draught
at
woodstocks
iv
dark
brown
with
a
medium
beige
head
that
laces
the
glass
roasty
and
toasty
aroma
with
some
herbal
quality
the
flavor
is
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
porter
with
some
chocolate
roasted
bitterness
showing
but
remaining
pretty
smooth
the
hemp
is
subtle
as
has
been
every
example
ive
had
but
it
adds
a
nice
dimension
and
makes
for
an
interesting
and
drinkable
darker
ale
medium
to
lighter
body
and
lighter
carbonation
drinkability
is
not
so
high
due
to
the
flavor
profile
but
certainly
glad
i
got
to
try
it
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
head
i
detect
a
whiff
of
hops
and
a
little
spice
taste
is
unique
reminds
me
of
dr
pepper
malt
and
hops
are
in
balanceneither
are
significant
i
get
more
spices
than
hops
and
malt
finishes
with
a
little
roast
not
sure
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
i
think
the
hemp
gives
the
mouthfeel
a
certain
amount
of
oiliness
drinkabiity
is
high
interesting
but
nevertheless
a
novelty
offers
very
little
as
a
beer
ill
pass
in
the
future
anyone
want
the
rest
of
my
sixpack
tonight
typical
brown
ale
with
garnet
hints
and
a
frothy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
average
malt
nose
not
picking
up
too
much
else
dark
fruit
taste
was
average
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
hemp
ale
in
taste
or
mouthfeel
sticky
icky
thiner
body
and
average
taste
nice
very
sublte
nuttiness
not
much
else
maybe
something
for
someone
new
to
craft
beet
to
try
great
label
interesting
ingredient
hemp
but
i
didnt
get
much
of
it
d
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
with
a
meal
or
on
a
hot
oakland
night
d
would
make
a
great
session
beer
dark
pour
that
looks
basically
black
with
head
that
didnt
hang
around
for
long
at
all
smell
was
a
different
sort
of
dark
ripe
sweet
fruit
and
roasted
maltish
taste
was
more
nutty
and
kind
of
like
a
nut
brown
ale
and
has
slightly
low
carbonation
making
it
a
touch
watery
since
its
body
was
on
the
thinner
side
as
well
this
wasnt
bad
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
i
thought
final
note
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
novelty
beer
but
the
novelty
quickly
wore
off
i
think
this
the
hemp
infused
beer
i
have
hadpoured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
mix
of
deep
brown
and
amber
a
thinner
wispy
white
head
atop
very
light
aromas
i
pick
up
a
little
spice
and
brown
sugar
but
really
not
much
going
onflavors
are
malt
tilted
no
doubt
and
quite
mild
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
roasted
nuts
with
a
lingering
earthy
finish
with
a
cola
quality
as
well
not
much
complexity
to
the
beer
and
very
faint
hops
glad
i
tried
it
but
to
me
its
just
a
standard
brown
ale
with
a
touch
of
herb
if
i
could
get
more
i
certainly
would
this
seems
like
a
hype
or
shock
beer
marketing
wise
but
regardless
its
a
very
good
beer
ill
look
for
others
from
this
brewery
great
brew
if
you
see
one
especially
ontap
go
ahead
and
give
it
a
try
you
just
might
like
it
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
stuff
has
nice
abv
and
thickness
to
it
it
produced
a
nice
foamy
deeptan
head
over
an
unexpectedly
dark
beer
the
color
was
a
colabrown
with
ruby
highlights
and
nequality
clarity
the
nose
was
sweet
and
malty
with
a
slight
nuttiness
almost
caramelized
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
becoming
readily
apparent
on
the
palate
the
finish
had
more
that
nutty
roasty
even
smoky
quality
that
i
had
noted
on
the
nose
i
wonder
how
it
would
go
with
hempzels
from
lancaster
co
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
bit
sweet
for
my
hophead
taste
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
certainly
has
an
interesting
ingredient
but
i
cant
really
see
this
being
added
to
beer
on
its
flavor
merits
alone

a

i
could

it
actually
looks

substantial

has
an
unique
floral
hoppy
smell
that
translates
right
into
the
herbal
fairly
aggressive
hop
character
that
finishes
with
light
spiced
fruit
an
ale
with
a
very
nice
semi
substantial

when
paired
with

much

average
drinkabliltiy
a
fairly
easy

its
vaguely
interesting
once
im
thankful
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
buy
a
single
bottle
a
bit
like
a
brown
ale
nothing
special
overall
not
as
dry
as
id
like
out
of
a
hoppier
beer
but
then
again
this
reflects
its
growth
under
of
the
early
american
micro
brown
ale
stylings
with
a
ton
of
crystal
malts
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
mahogany
with
a
tannish
head
that
dissipated
rather
quicly
not
sure
what
im
smelling
roasted
hemp
seeds
definitely
a
roasted
aroma
taste
of
roasted
malt
reminds
me
of
a
black
beer
but
watered
down
mouthfeel
is
thin
which
could
make
this
fairly
drinkable
but
the
actual
taste
leaves
nothing
for
me
nice
to
try
but
i
probably
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
in
the
future
just
a
minor
step
above
a
macro
imho
mouthfeel
is
spicy
and
carbonated
a
very
drinkable
ale
nice
and
fun
on
a
warm
spring
day
d
ok
beer
i
guess
d
even
with
all
the
flavors
they
blend
together
well
and
make
this
quite
drinkable
im
a
big
fan
of
spiced
beers
and
have
always
defended
chile
spruce
and
other
herb
beers
in
the
face

theyre
made

theyre

overall
a
well

o
a
very
unique
beer
that
seems
to
be
the
collision
of
several
styles
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
on
the
level
of
the
phrase
jack
of
all
trades
but
master
of
none
there
are
some
complex
intriguing
things
going
on
here
but
it
doesnt
all
come
together
if
youve
ever
been
to
an
improv
comedy
show
you
understand
the
irony
of
this
beers
name
d
lot
of
this
to
blanket
the
palate
in
a
750ml
bottle
pleasant
drinking
imperial
brown
ale
would
be
great
with
dessert
like
chocolate
mousse
this
beer
was
just
terrible
the
color
was
real
nice
but
that
is
about
it
it
was
way
over
carbonated
and
tasted
sour
like
spoiled
lunch
meat
mixed
with
brett
pretty
sure
this
was
a
bottle
that
was
infected
or
something
i
hope
this
was
not
the
intended
carbonation
aroma
and
taste
every
other
beer
ive
had
from
cigar
city
has
been
outstanding
not
this
one
small
to
medium
foam
head
dark
brown
color
and
rye
and
toasted
smell
quite
hoppy
with
a
very
present
rye
taste
subtle
rich
caramel
taste
has
a
nice
bitter
finish
hard
to
rate
because
its
such
a
unique
beer
with
quite
a
few
flavors
at
once
not
too
many
similar
beers
to
compare
it
to
a
very

though

o
c
a
very
fine
closer
for

good
for
brooding
the

a

inch
of

include
malt
light
fruit
a
touch
of
roast
breads

nice
flavor
well
balanced

i
like
the
flavor
a
little
better
than
the
aroma
lightly
sweet
throughout
subtle
chocolate
tones
and
a
pleasant
bready
character
a
solid
brew
from
cigar
city
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
this
beer
theres
simply
too
much
going
on
here
without
adding
complexity
or
being
all
that
tasty
fail
o
i
wont
seek
for
this
again
its
definitely
unique
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
for
sure
overall
an
amazing
brew
tons
of
really
complex
flavors
mighty
tasty
recommended
right
off
the
bat
without
knowing
anything
about
this
beer
i
smelled
oatmeal
it
was
real
rich
ok
starting
from
the
top
the
beer
was
a
very
dark
shoe
polish
brown
with
some
bubbles
on
the
top
not
much
lace
none
at
all
actually
smell
is
oatmeal
as
stated
above
it
is
rich
with
some
caramel
and
rye
alt
backing
with
some
earthy
hop
aroma
maybe
some
cocco
with
warming
rich
malt
profile
throughout
without
overkill
taste
is
pretty
nice
i
get
a
lot
of
flavor
not
knowing
the
age
of
the
keg
i
have
to
say
it
is
at
least
drinking
well
tastes
include
some
nut
flavor
with
oatmeal
rye
malt
flavor
some
dark
fruit
appeal
mild
hop
intrusion
and
some
baked
bread
it
comes
together
nicely
although
browns
are
not
my
thing
florida
seems
to
pump
out
some
nice
big
versions
of
them
heres
to
hoping
more
sees
its
way
up
to
philly
on
a
more
annual
basis
besides
the
maduro
dull
brown
pour
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
holds
strong
despite
its
9abv
it
looks
thick
and
stagnant
with
its
dense
body
and
heavy
sediment
the
nose
is
a
weak
jumbling
of
favors
that
are
rather
hard
to
decipher
there
is
a
definite
booziness
and
spice
but
its
not
pronounced
however
the
taste
is
an
intense
chocolate
milkiness
with
a
nice
complimentary
spiciness
from
the
rye
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
with
great
balance
between
the
intense
flavors
its
definitely
a
big
beer
that
id
expect
from
ccb
but
its
quite
drinkable
at
the
same
time
very
tasty
and
would
probably
be
great

taste
is
much
the

with
a

of
bitterness
on
the

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of

with
a
crisp

overall
this
is
a
pretty

nothing

here

there

even
the

was
a
bit
one
note
serving
type
16
ounces
can
if
i
were
to
sum
this
beer
up
i
would
probably
call
it
an
imperial

its
extremely
well
balanced
and
just
overall
very
enjoyable
without
being
overly
complex
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
tan

of
lightly
toasted

taste
begins
with
a
hint
of

then
some

and
finishing
with
a

finish
mouth
feel
is
pretty
good
overall
a
solid

a

very
english
cant

overall
i
really
like
what
this
beer
has
going
for
it
in
how
unusual
it
is
its
definitely
an
odd
mixture
of
a
pilsener
and
a
piney
stout
in
the
form
of
a
brown
ale
my
complaint
would
be
that
there
is
no
one
thing
that
really
stands
out
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
brown
but
still
has
a
nice
body
to
it
pours
nice
good

nice
flavor

on
this
one
consistent
and

i
like
it
always
refreshing

done

not

i
would
keep
a

pack
in
the
fridge
toasted
malt
and
caramel
a
tad
syrupy
o
brown
ales
typically
bore
me
but
over
ale
grabbed
my
taste
buds
and
had
me
wanting
more
very
sessionable
and
still
complex
i
didnt
expect
a
hoppy
brown
ale
but
thats
what
i
got
the
hop
profile
is
similar
to
daisy
cutter
and
gossamer
but
the
hopmalt
bill
is
more
balanced
and
roasty
nice
overall
its
not
bad
but
neither
is
it
great
its
aggressive
hop
component
is
not
really
backed
up
leaving
it
slightly
out
of
balance
but
more
importantly
it
disappoints
in
that
it
lacks
in
complexity
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
very
fluffy
looking
tan
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
is
decent
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
lightly
toasted
sort
of
sweet
and
has
some
fresh
grain
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
similar
to
the
nose
the
sweetness
fades
into
the
toasted
finish
with
a
subtle
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lighter
bodied
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
brew

good

i
had
no

crushing
a
couple
of
cans
of
this
nice
beer
o
good
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
for
me
would
certainly
buy
it
again
if
i
came
across
it
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
a
style
that
im
not
that
fond
of
this
would
be
a
wonderful
match
with
much
of
american
cuisine
a
dark
brown
color
with
golden
edges
and
a
very
strong
single
finger
head
thats
off
white
and
leaves
very
healthy
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
solid
caramel
malt
with
a
mellow
grass
hop
a
bit
of
brown
bread
and
molasses
not
bad
the
flavor
presents
a
straight
ahead
charcoal
brown
bread
with
evergreen
grass
hop
highlights
theres
a
subtle
touch
of
milk
chocolate
and
muted
sour
dough
this
stuff
is
medium
bodied
but
its
very
effervescent
with
tiny
bubble
carbonation
for
a
full
foamy
feel
that
finishes
just
a
tad
dry
very
decent
brown
ale
o
overall
a
solid
brown
ale
easy
drinking
with
classic
flavors
that
are
melded
together
nicely
o
good
brown
with
nice
flavors
and
aromas
o
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
extraordinary
many
newer
american
brown
ales
are
far
to
hop
heavy
while
there
are
good
examples
of
hoppy
brown
ales
out
there
this
one
is
more
malt
focused
its
strongest
characteristic
is
the
balance
between
malt
and
hops
its
a
pretty
standard
brown
ale
and
user
friendly
coming
from
half
acre
but
nothing
spectacular
o
very
enjoyable
a
nice
and
somewhatunique
flavor
that
is
nice
when
you
want
a
lighter
brown
ale
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
which
has
some
interestig
malt
flavor
which
i
would
describe
mainly
as
biscuit
however
there
is
a
subtle
spice
and
pine
ting
from
the
hops
which
adds
some
depth
the
yeast
is
mainly
clean
but
adds
a
little
bit
of
dried
fruit
to
the
mix
with
nice
sweetness
from
the
malt
keeping
it
focused
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
good
american
brown
ale
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
very
solid
and
a
great
balance
is
achieved
which
makes
for
a
drinkable
somewhat
stronger
ale
the
crack
glug
initially
netted
me
better
than
two
fingers
worth
of
thick
mochatan
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deepcopperlightbrown
with
nequality
clarity
nose
marked
it
as
most
definitely
being
a
brown
ale
it
had
a
very
brown
sugary
malt
sweetness
to
it
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
it
was
not
as
sweet
in
the
mouth
as
the
nose
had
suggested
instead
it
had
a
minty
hops
quality
accompanying
the
chocolate
and
biscuit
malt
flavor
adding
up
to
the
liquid
equivalent
of
a
girl
scout
thin
mint
cookie
yum
finish
was
very
minty
and
not
at
all
what
i
had
thought
that
it
would
be
also
great
sticky
lacing
throughout
o
really
nice

beer
can
get
super
fresh

for
2
a
can
convenient
and
nice
perfect
for
every
occasion
just
enough
hops
to
satisfy
hop
heads
as
any
half
acre
fan
is
and
just
enough
balance
to
satisfy
everyone
else
half
acre
over
ale
pours
a
deep
chestnut
brown
with
some
orange
highlights
when
held
to
light
three
fingers
or
so
of
cream
colored
foam
rise
up
to
top
the
beer
head
retention
is
fairly
good
most
of
it
fades
away
over
five
or
so
minutes
but
the
last
bits
of
foam
stick
around
for
a
long
time
lacing
is
left
in
a
nice
webbed
pattern
the
nose
is
solid
if
unspectacular
lots
of
lightly
toasted
nuts
and
crisp
biscuits
the
flavor
leads
off
with
those
same
two
malty
notes
next
comes
a
lighty
firm
bit
of
bitterness
yup
definitely
an
american
take
on
a
brown
ale
along
with
some
earthy
and
light
grapefruit
hoppy
notes
the
slightly
dry
chocolate
that
comes
in
for
the
close
is
what
takes
this
beer
to
the
next
level
the
body
is
just
a
little
light
for
the
style
which
in
turn
helps
the
carbonation
come
off
as
a
little
more
active
than
it
probably
needs
to
while
its
not
quite
perfect
half
acre
over
ales
still
a
pretty
darn
enjoyable
american
brown

im
always
happy
to
drink
a
new
brown
ale
this
one
seems
to
be
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
though
pours
a
transparent
but
lightly
clouded
brown
decent
cap
of
offwhite
froth
little
retention
scent
leads
with
roasted
nuts
and
rustic
bread
moderate
hope
profile
brings
citrus
light
sweetness
taste
brings
components
of
scent
together
the
malt
backbone
is
nutty
and
bready
could
use
a
bit
more
heft
juicy
hops
give
the
beer
some
edge
medium
bodied
moderately
dry
decent
brown
ale
all
around
good
flavor
but
malt
bill
could
have
been
upped
slightly
overall
an
interesting
brown
ale
nothing
special
but
very
solid
overall
a
decent
brew
just
too
bready
for
my
taste
maybe
if
it
was
less
bready
and
more
hoppy
or
citrus
cheers
overall
its
pretty
good
not
spectacular
but
easily
drinkable
overall
a
nice
session
ale
plenty
of
complexity
to
keep
things
interesting
a
winner
tastes
not
quite
as
good
as
a
smells
starts
with
nutty
bread
dough
moves
into
sugared
chestnuts
blended
with
citrusy
hops
and
then
it
gets
a
tiny
bit
weird
with
big
nodes
of
boiled
veggies
like
im
drinking
old
school
rolling
rock
the
veggies
linger
surprisingly
pleasantly
but
they
override
most
of
the
nice
sweet
barley
that
probably
would
do
a
better
job
of
balancing
out
the
beer
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
decent
example
of
the
style
not
something
i
am
likely
to
seek
out
again
trying
the
half
acre
over
ale
tonight
and
it
is
tasty
tasty
the
appearance
is
great
a
deep
rich
brownish
clear
amber
with
off
white
head
that
is
lacing
the
smell
includes
molassis
malts
and
hints
of
roast
and
perhaps
noble
hops
the
taste
is
a
slightly
nutty
and
molassis
sweetness
which
is
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
in
boday
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
a
nice
hoppy
brown
ale
what
i
like
about
it
is
the
hops
dont
dominate
the
malt
they
add
a
nice
bite
to
it
the
only
thing
i
would
change
is
the
lingering
bitterness
on
the
end
but
i
think
i
can
deal
with
it
overall
a
nice
drinkable
beer
that
could
be
enjoyed
on
a
warm
summer
day
or
cold
winter
night
do
this
robust
ale
from
the
half
acre
stable
bears
little
relation
to
their
daisy
cutter
pale
ale
relatively
challenging
on
the
palate
but
only
compared
to
that
other
beers
universal
approachability
the
smell
resembles
some
other
american
brown
ales
such
as
sierra
nevadas
tumbler
but
is
more
satisfying
it
almost
begs
for
other
strong
and
savory
flavors
to
complement
making
it
foodfriendly
but
likely
to
induce
some
palate
fatigue
when
taken
by
itself

is

finishes
like
a
really
mild

a
very
decent
little

here
mildly

up

nice
finish
not
too
dry
a
well
connected
a
decent
little
beer
nothing
too
special
but
definitely
solid
i
enjoyed
this
i
like
the
hoppier
style
of
brown
and
i
especially
liked
its
not
just
a
brown
ale
hopped
up
with
a
bunch
of
west
coast
citrus
hops
its
hoppy
but
in
a
more
nontraditional
way
appearance
is
a
translucent
mahogany
with
a
healthy
head
upon
pour
aroma
is
that
of
grassy
floral
hops
with
a
caramel
backing
taste
is
malty
with
notes
of
grassy
hops
mouthful
is
sweet
with
a
medium
resinous
body
leaves
an
almost
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
a
good
canned
beer
would
be
good
in
the
heat
thanks
again
gcurlow
cheers
d
probably
the
best
brown
ale
beer
ive
ever
had
compliments
dark
fruits
would
go
great
with
a
meal
nice
and
light
body
but
full
of
character
overall
a
damn
fine
take
on
the
style
its
not
quite
surly
bender
but
its
got
to
be
cheaper
and
that
goes
a
long
way
super
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
can
of
deliciously
crafted
malts
wellbalanced
and
well
worth
seeking
out
o
in
case
it
wasnt
obvious
im
wholly
uninspired
by
this
beer
while
it
is
by
no
means
bad
i
wouldnt
necessarily
recommend
it
to
anybody
either
definitely
not
the
best
half
acre
has
to
offer
o
drinkable
but
it
didnt
really
blow
me
away
a
decent
beer
o
overall
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
very
easy
to
drink
and
some
standard
toasted
malts
and
nuts
would
give
it
another
shot
this
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
brown
ale
its
deceivingly
light
at
first
but
quite
flavorful
in
the
end
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
o
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
brown
good
strong
character
but
still
holding
on
to
a
light
drinkablity
o
a
unique
and
tasty
take
on
the
style
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
a
refreshing
spike
of
carbonation
overall
very
nice
bitter
to
sip
with
a
meal
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
character
to
balance
out
the
malt
bill
o
this
was
quite
good
the
can
provided
little
description
of
the
ale
within
but
it
was
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
drink
this
is
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
i
have
only
had
surly
out
of
the
can
and
this
is
right
up
there
as
well
cant
recall
having
any
other
brown
ales
in
the
can
besides
surly
bender
which
i
dont
like
very
much
so
this
one
is
setting
a
gold
standard
of
sorts
very
good
depth
of
flavor
while
maintaining
drinkability
roasty
and
nutty
without
being
excessively
dry
or
ashy
tight
carbonation
if
i
lived
in
the
greater
chicago
area
this
would
be
a
goto
fall
beer
for
me
i
wish
it
had
a
touch
more
body
but
the
drinkability
would
then
suffer
the
beer
has
midweight
heft
that
seems
to
work
well
with
the
flavors
this
is
an
easy
drinking
tasty
brown
well
done
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
fairly
good
session
beer
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
brown
ale
smooth
and
well
balanced
and
i
would
be
happy
to
have
another
toasted
malts
and
herbal
hops
up
front
sweetish
caramel
and
toffee
malts
fill
in
herbal
slightly
grassy
hop
bitterness
along
with
some
nuttiness
some
milk
chocolate
and
earthy
tobacco
near
the
finish
lingering
sweet
caramel
malt
and
slightly
roasty
bitterness
mediumbodied
with
a
slightly
creamy
feel
pretty
tasty
d
this
batch
seems
to
be
more
true
to
the
esb
roots
of
this
beer
as
i
found
it
more
bitter
and
dry
than
a
typical
american
brown
ale
and
without
the
occasionally
cloying
chocolate
sweetness
found
in
that
style
not
as
sessionfriendly
as
half
acres
other
yearround
offerings
but
a
nice
beer
for
those
not
really
into
hops
god
forbid
id
prefer
meat
wave
but
this
is
still
pretty
solid
o
at
first
it
seemed
like
i
was
in
for
a
treat
but
the
bitterness
which
isnt
too
in
your
face
mind
you
spoiled
this
one
for
me
a
bit
then
i
got
over
it
and
it
was
a
decent
brown
ale
nothing
crazy
but
not
bad
o
i
really
enjoy
drinking
this
brown
ale
but
in
the
flavor
profile
specifically
the
nose
im
not
getting
much
enjoyed
this
one
but
not
something
id
seek
again
pours
a
clean
amberish
to
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
gingerbread
like
malt
some
small
hop
presence
in
there
too
in
the
taste
small
orange
citrus
mostly
a
lighter
roast
of
grain
and
some
gingerbread
like
malt
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
grapefruity
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
at
first
i
was
like
eh
but
it
grew
on
me
nice
mellow
hops
quite
enjoyable
poured
a
dark
brown
with
red
undertones
and
a
nice
tan
head
the
nose
is
characterized
by
earthy
malts
with
a
little
bit
oftea
its
weak
overall
the
taste
is
malt
heavy
a
little
bit
of
smoke
a
little
bit
of
nutty
character
some
lemoncitrus
hops
its
actually
a
surprisingly
complex
taste
but
im
not
sure
how
well
it
all
fits
together
mouthfeel
slightly
watery
and
so
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
would
stick
with
the
other
half
acre
offerings
this
pours
medium
brown
with
red
peeking
through
held
up
to
a
light
a
one
finger
cream
head
that
dissipates
and
only
a
hint
of
lace
on
the
nose
there
is
a
mix
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
with
a
good
dash
of
earthy
hops
the
piney
hop
presence
is
more
like
dead
pine
needles
in
the
fall
rather
than
resiny
pine
in
the
mouth
there
is
a
good
balance
between
the
earthy
hops
but
perhaps
the
malts
stick
a
bit
too
far
forward
and
get
a
little
too
sticky
to
me
the
body
is
medium
carbonation
perfect
for
the
style
and
the
finish
is
nicely
medium
length
with
the
good
balance
lingering
overall
this
isnt
my
favorite
brown
ale
and
certainly
not
my
favorite
from
half
acre
but
if
this
is
as
bad
as
it
gets
for
them
then
theyve
got
a
great
brewery
d
a
good
bitter
brown
i
like
this
overall
a
very
good
sessionable
beer
nothing
aggressive
overall
2
5
not
much
to
it
and
pretty
watery
surprisingly
6
as
it
tastes
moe
like
4
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
to
high
prickly
carbonation
o
worth
the
buy
ive
enjoyed
pretty
much
whatever
ive
had
from
half
acre
and
was
happy
to
stumble
across
this
one
i
know
this
might
be
crazy
to
say
but
i
think
i
enjoy
it
even
more
than
daisy
cutter
deal
with
it
d
really
solid
and
refreshing
beer
that
i
am
truly
enjoying
overall
it
is
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
definitely
hoppier
then
most
but
it
worked
well
for
it
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
beer
wit
ha
lot
of
flavor
another
very
solid
beer
form
half
acre
overall
pretty
good
easy
to
drink
half
acre
continues
to
impress
drinkability
good
would
definitely
recommend
and
drink
again
o
for
a
brown
i
can
genuinely
say
i
liked
this
one
did
i
love
it
no
but
id
certainly
drink
it
again
if
offered
half
acres
over
ale
is
a
good
everyday
drinking
beer
its
not
overly
complex
its
simply
a
nice
can
of
suds
a
good
representation
of
a
fresh
brown
ale
nicely
done
by
half
acre
good
beer
from
a
very
good
brewer
and
by
dangerous
i
mean
i
could
drink
pint
after
pint
after
pint
d
really
good
stuff
easy
as
hell
to
drink
thin
yet
flavorful
pale
brown
malts
glide
across
the
top
of
the
palate
and
add
notes
of
sweetbread
and
caramel
a
tinge
of
piny
hops
english
yeast
and
light
booze
esters
ride
out
into
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
for
the
style
with
a
crisp
carbonation
level
and
mediumlight
body
drinks
easily
and
doesnt
dry
out
the
tongue
too
much
over
ale
a
sessionable
drinkable
brown
ale
in
a
can
no
frills
no
shenanigans
just
tasty
beer
suggestion
be
sure
to
buy
two
packs
as
the
first
will
disappear
rather
quickly
d
this
is
a
well
balanced
brown
ale
with
lots
of
character
this
is
yet
another
example
of
half
acre
putting
their
own
spin
on
a
classic
style
not
mind
blowing
by
any
means
but
certainly
worth
a
try
or
a
session
conclusion
it
was
good
nothing
aggressive
for
the
most
part
it
was
a
tad
above
average
for
a
brown
ale
this
had
a
rounded
flavor
that
was
enjoyable
malt
forward
flavors
again
earthy
and
bready
with
some
apple
from
the
yeast
some
light
toast
and
bitter
tobacco
residual
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
fairly
light
bready
and
crisp
like
autumn
leaves
easygoing
carbonation
that
lends
a
bit
of
bite
a
fine
local
session
ale
i
was
actually
pretty
impressed
and
can
definitely
recommend
another
few
rounds
the
mouthfeel
is
way
to
watery
thin
for
my
tastes
it
would
be
a
good
staple
beer
that
i
would
keep
in
stock
if
it
just
had
a
little
more
body
and
some
more
carbonation
to
keep
it
lively
it
still
is
greatly
drinkable
though
and
even
though
and
i
had
no
problem
killing
a
growler
by
myself
over
a
few
hours
time
a
big
fan
of
daisy
cutter
pale
ale
d
very
drinkable
the
second
bottle
was
better
as
my
tastebuds
adjusted
but
it
was
a
nice
drinkable
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
just
purchased
a
half
barrel
from
the
brewery
this
fine
evening
for
my
kegarator
this
stuff
is
dangerously
drinkable
just
finished
my
first
pint
and
heading
back
for
number
2
in
quick
order
very
solid
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
the
alcohol
is
not
terribly
noticeable
and
im
suspecting
that
it
will
sneak
up
on
me
in
quick
order
if
im
not
careful
although
i
intended
to
pick
up
a
half
barrel
of
daisy
cutter
i
dont
regret
this
for
a
second
very
tasty
and
worth
the
drive
from
the
south
suburbs
up
to
half
acre
for
a
fresh
keg
dated
11132010
of
over
ale
just
in
time
for
thanksgiving
and
believe
me
when
i
say
im
thankful
the
last
of
the
three
growlers
from
our
half
acre
tour
trip
it
pours
a
clear
dark
sunset
amber
topped
by
finger
of
thick
creamy
foam
the
nose
comprises
pine
grapefruit
grass
and
some
light
biscuit
the
taste
holds
notes
of
green
tea
melon
cucumber
grasses
and
very
light
biscuit
the
hoppier
notes
seem
to
strangely
overpower
the
very
meek
malts
for
me
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
feel
that
migrates
from
fluid
to
dry
overall
an
okay
brew
but
a
bit
unbalanced
and
grassy
for
my
tastes
ive
had
this
before
at
the
brewery
and
loved
it
so
i
figured
now
was
a
good
time
to
review
it
this
pours
a
nice
rosewood
color
with
a
good
pillow
head
on
the
top
that
is
well
retained
with
beautiful
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
both
of
nice
fresh
hop
and
some
caramel
malts
there
are
some
roasty
and
nutty
smells
in
the
background
as
well
the
flavors
are
a
nice
balance
of
malts
and
hops
the
hop
flavors
are
akin
to
some
nice
orange
zest
there
are
bitter
flavors
but
they
are
in
the
background
of
the
nice
roasted
caramel
and
butterscotch
flavors
this
beer
is
very
well
carbonated
and
aside
from
bitter
notes
which
are
appropriate
it
was
a
very
smooth
beer
this
was
really
easy
to
drink
it
pairs
well
with
most
foods
and
is
a
definite
recommendation
from
me
draft
pours
a
reddish
copper
color
with
a
1
finger
off
white
head
slight
roasted

very
simple

forward
and
clean

slighlty

slight

a

not

for

at
the
brewery
this
is
a
winner
ddelicious
moving
on
to
a
2nd
very
drinkable
right
now
d
pretty
damn
enjoyable
make
sure
to
let
this
get
around
cellar
temp
before
pouring
it
really
opens
up
when
it
warms
drinkability
i
could
kick
back
2
or
3
of
these
within
a
reasonable
time
and
be
a
happy
camper
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
kudos
go
out
to
half
acre
brewing
and
jeff
overall
this
is
an
above
average
brown
ale
not
sure
how
its
an
esb
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
do
a
lot
of
just
a
touch
sweet
to
session
most
likely
deasy
drinking
nice
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
im
guessing
my
previous
review
of
this
was
possibly
from
an
old
bottle
i
will
try
another
bottle
and
edit
my
other
review
accordingly
if
need
be
d
over
ale
is
an
easy
drinkin
brew
from
an
upandcoming
brewery
one
that
i
like
very
much
and
is
also
a
block
from
my
house
im
truly
enjoying
this
very
sessionable
at
6
this
beer
is
also
an
excellent
match
for
the
spicy
lasagna
the
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
extension
of
the
creamy
mozzarella
ricotta
and
goat
cheese
in
the
meal
while
the
caramel
and
toasty
flavors
do
a
good
job
of
balancing
out
the
spice
in
the
hot
italian
sausage
the
mintyspicy
hops
although
mild
also
kick
up
the
spice
while
the
malt
works
to
balance
it
out
its
a
wonderful
little
tugowar
going
on
overall
this
is
a
tasty
brew
a
bit
more
than
expected
out
of
an
esb
but
tasty
nonetheless
a
great
beer
for
when
you
are
feeling
like
you
want
a
little
more
than
your
typical
lawnmower
beer
can
offer
but
you
dont
want
to
be
overwhelmed
this
is
a
nice
rich
complex
malty
brew
with
an
excellent
complimentary
hop
balance
it
offers
a
lot
of
complexity
but
is
ridiculously
drinkable
and
makes
one
heck
of
a
good
session
brew
one
of
my
local
favorites
i
had
this
on
tap
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
this
again
fresh
from
a
bottle
this
is
a
a
beer
ill
buy
from
time
to
time
to
support
local
beer
i
wish
habc
would
bottle
some
other
things
instead
of
this
but
its
a
nice
malty
beer
i
will
continue
to
pick
it
up
until
they
start
putting
a
few
other
things
out
there
d
its
no
suprise
why
this
sixer
disappeared
so
quickly
a
very
tasty
beer
d
very
drinkable
flavors
are
a
bit
muted
but
i
like
the
bitter
finish
d
easy
drinking
neither
too
complex
nor
too
simple
poured
with
a
full
head
that
went
flat
quickly
a
nice
dark
brown
color
promising
warmth
which
i
need
right
now
the
smell
was
all
biscuit
for
me
and
this
came
through
in
the
taste
too
the
biscuit
taste
was
balanced
by
some
spice
on
the
end
that
evened
things
out
and
made
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
on
a
cold
day
the
mouthfeel
similar
to
a
lot
of
english
bitters
left
my
mouth
dry
so
i
drank
more
pours
a
reddish
medium
brownish
ckear
ambe
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
to
start
no
bubbling
though
the
smell
has
slightly
sweet
caramel
and
bready
toasted
malts
while
the
hops
adda
little
orange
spice
to
each
sniff
the
taste
is
equally
balanced
with
great
touch
of
sweetness
malts
and
full
of
bread
and
biscuits
then
the
hops
bitter
and
spice
things
up
to
even
out
the
malts
a
little
super
session
ale
right
here
a
little
grainy
and
bubbly
on
the
palate
just
a
nice
english
style
esb
d
moderately
drinkable
flavors
are
not
overwhelming
no
palette
fatigue
abv
is
not
stated
unknown
hard
to
judge
but
a
esb
shouldnt
knock
my
socks
off
this
one
hasnt
so
far
half
acre
over
ale
poured
brownred
with
nice
lacing
and
good
sized
white
head
smell
was
super
citrusy
hops
taste
was
of
dark
berries
hints
of
sweetness
good
sweetness
hints
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
ok
drinkability
was
good
this
was
a
good
beer
very
interesting
flavors
good
hops
and
nice
sweetness
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
great
deal
and
will
buy
this
beer
again
d
a
solid
esb
but
not
a
great
one
a
nice
fresh
offering
for
the
locals
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
but
a
bit
thin
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
of
this
d
it
just
didnt
deliver
like
i
think
it
could
the
malt
profile
was
a
bit
weak
and
at
times
it
had
a
slight
watery
taste
to
it
the
hop
profile
got
the
better
of
the
malt
generally
though
a
nice
brew
id
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
you
could
definitely
down
a
few
of
these
id
like
to
try
it
ontap
im
quite
impressed
with
this
beer
its
solid
well
built
and
damn
tasty
half
acre
is
a
welcome
addition
to
the
chicago
beer
scene
and
i
plan
on
drinking
plenty
more
of
these
la
chaim
d
this
is
a
session
brew
of
the
first
order
d
a
solid
session
beer
on
the
maltier
side
of
esbs
d
i
think
the
beer
should
be
in
the
low
a
level
while
its
a
great
beer
it
lacks
ultimately
unique
qualities
that
many
other
micros
maintain
i
like
this
beer
alot
and
will
continue
to
purchase
it
very
good
i
like
this
one
better
than
the
half
acre
lager
the
flagship
brew
this
one
on
tap
is
hoppier
than
the
bottle
version
to
me
same
as
the
lager
go
figure
i
love
hops
believe
me
but
both
half
acre
brews
for
my
personal
taste
could
be
not
less
hoppy
but
more
malty
for
balance
still
good
though
this
is
a
fine
brew
by
a
new
chicago
brewery
and
i
wish
them
much
success
drinkability
a
very
sessionable
brew
but
for
the
price
there
are
plenty
with
stronger
flavors
a
fairly
robust
beer
that
is
simple
in
tastethe
varieties
of
barley
overpower
the
hops
flavor
which
is
nice
but
makes
me
only
want
to
drink
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
i
didnt
detect
any
fruitiness
and
the
smell
was
on
par
with
the
tastethe
essence
of
simplicity
unfettered
by
all
the
extra
additions
that
abound
in
so
many
craft
beers
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
medium
lasting
beige
head
smell
is
kind
of
fruity
and
malty
with
a
nuttiness
too
mild
but
nice
taste
is
biscuity
dusty
and
fruity
with
a
bit
of
nutty
flavor
as
well
balanced
and
what
id
expect
flavorwise
in
the
style
and
very
drinkable
medium
bodied
and
good
carbonation
i
thought
it
was
pretty
nice
and
a
very
drinkable
sessionable
beer
this
is
a
real
treat
anymore
it
seems
that
brewers
like
to
add
to
many
american
hops
to
bitter
their
browns
but
this
one
is
wellbalanced
between
malty
goodness
with
just
enough
hops
to
really
make
it
a
winner
in
my
book
i
love
it
i
hope
i
can
locate
a
place
to
buy
it
on
tap
at
tilted
kilt
not
terrible
but
i
wouldnt
order
it
again
average
brown
ale
bready
and
nutty
pretty
surprised
this
own
gold
at
gabf
not
bad
really
but
very
average
brown
ale
overall
leans
heavily
on
malt
which
gives
off
a
strong
sour
bread
taste
some
hints
of
gingerbread
and
nuts
i
prefer
my
browns
to
be
a
bit
fuller
and
bolder
gabf
gold
medal
winner
i
have
friends
that
dont
like
dark
beers
they
taste
sweet
josie
and
love
it
o
there
are
a
lot
of
poor
brown
ales
out
there
these
days
but
this
is
an
overall
nice
one
balanced
and
drinkable
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
no
obvious
flaws
smooth
full
bodied
but
not
over
the
top
a
big
thanks
to
the
creator
of

this

some
hops
bready
a
bit
of
caramel
very
smooth

and
overall
a
solid
and
enjoyable
beer
dark
mahogany
body
with
an
inch
of
beige
head
fruity
dark
malt
candy
molasses
similar
flavor
medium
to
light
body
decent
smells
like
a
porter
with
deep
toasted
bread
the
flavor
follows
this
smell
accurately
the
body
is
middle
of
the
road
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
outstanding
brown
im
not
a
huge
brown
fan
but
this
one
might
be
changing
that
i
feel
like
a
lot
of
browns
are
humdrum
and
this
one
is
interesting
and
delicious
good
roasty
malty
brown
ale
not
overly
bitter
and
well
balanced
aroma
is
nutty
and
toasted
with
hints
of
chocolate
roasty
malt
and
floral
hops
flavor
reveals
a
roasted
malt
backbone
which
is
accented
by
toasted
nuts
burnt
breadcrust
and
lightly
sweet
chocolate
the
finish
is
lightly
bitter
great
malt
complexity
im
marrying
this
brown
love
it
mov
along
nothing
great
great
dark
and
bitter
taste
hate
that
its
only
available
in
cans
now
luckily
can
still
get
out
on
tap
at
a
few
locations

flavors
are

sweet

with
that
bittersweet
mocha
coffee
flavor
right
behind
in
the
backbone
creamy
highlights
help
blend
everything
together
and
with
the
subtle

this

lingering

this
is
a
solid
easy
drinking
beer
o
definitely
a
great
idea
it
just
needs
more
character
and
body
if
i
find
after
opening
another
bottle
that
this
one
was
faulty
ill
rereview
almost
perfect
hops
are
correct
for
this
ale
beautiful
color
always
consistent
an
excellent
one
beer
beer
to
drink
does
not
loose
its
attractiveness
after
tasting
other
beers
one
you
will
always
come
back
to
again
love
its
aroma
strong
enough
to
have
some
bite
when
1st
tasting
every
time
yet
keeps
delivering
for
each
one
alcohol
content
is
enough
for
you
to
know
youre
drinking
this
beer
at
half
a
bottle
does
not
loose
its
flavor
as
temperature
changes
great
to
grill
with
its
that
ive
got
this
beer
youve
got
to
try
when
entertaining
very
impressive
and
simple
not
too
much
going
on
like
some
beers
im
sure
all
beer
lovers
will
enjoy
this
one
for
its
drinkable
attitude
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
15
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
slight
hop
yeast
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
fits
the
style
of
an
american
brown
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
hint
of
yeast
hops
and
hint
of
alcohol
overall
weak
appearance
but
average
aroma
feel
and
body
poured
a
dark
brown
body
with
one
finger
head
on
top
of
a
hearty
aroma
of
roasted
malts
some
bread
to
them
caramel
and
a
good
amount
of
chocolate
unfortunately
the
beer
itself
does
not
deliver
like
the
aroma
medium
bodied
a
little
sticky
i
get
some
minor
sweetness
from
caramel
and
chocolate
but
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
any
balance
as
the
roasted
malts
dominant
and
the
beer
is
mostly
dry
with
a
drying
finish
and
there
really
isnt
much
more
to
say
because
this
is
not
a
real
flavorful
beer
either
not
going
to
say
its
watery
though
overall
a
good
example
of
brown
ale
refreshing
and
has
just
enough
body
to
it
to
be
a
good
drinking
beer
o
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
nothing
overpowers
anything
else
its
just
a
well
rounded
beer
overall
3
5
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
i
would
imagine
that
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
would
be
great
with
food
and
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
that
said
brown
ales
are
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
and
that
notwithstanding
i
would
nonetheless
recommend
this
beer
to
lovers
of
brown
ales
whoever
you
are
what
i
like
best
about
this
is
that
it
gives
aromas
flavors
and
the
sweetness
of
a
darker
beer
with
an
abv
thats
kicked
up
just
a
bit
but
still
light
enough
that
you
can
enjoy
a
couple
of
them
over
dinner
the
feel
was
rather
thin
not
necessarily
watery
but
easy
enough
the
body
was
very
fizzy
but
the
feel
avoided
any
negatives
from
the
carbonation
o
on
the
whole
this
is
a
likeable
but
not
exceptional
brown
ale
nonetheless
a
drinkable
beer
carbonation
is
moderate
and
makes
for
a
creamy
feel
off
a
light
crispness
it
develops
the
feel
of
an
english
brown
to
a
point
with
a
sort
of
metallic
aspect
and
a
little
bit
of
chalkiness
into
the
finish
its
nice
to
see
a
sturdy
body
in
a
style
that
sometimes
neglects
it
overall
easy
drinking
dark
side
of
malty
brown
ale
i
poured
this
nice
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
very
black
indeed
the
beer
pored
a
fair
head
with
a
tan
coloring
to
it
the
smell
was
of
roasted
coffee
and
nuts
head
ended
up
going
away
pretty
fast
the
good
news
though
is
that
the
beer
was
very
smooth
and
very
nice
tasting
i
would
certainly
buy
this
beer
again
o
overall
no
flavors
stand
out
too
strongly
to
me
but
im
a
beginner
at
this
mainly
i
think
it
is
just
a
nicely
balanced
brown
ale
with
no
one
flavor
grabbing
you
or
distracting
you
a
great
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
and
i
believe
thats
how
a
brown
ale
should
be
nothing
too
fancy
just
a
good
rounded
beer
o
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
wish
more
places
in
charlotte
had
this
on
tap
fans
of
brown
ale
should
give
this
a
try
o
definitely
worth
a
try
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
would
buy
this
regularly
if
it
were
a
local
i
used
to
be
a
regular
brooklyn
brown
ale
fan
but
have
found
it
to
be
a
little
lighter
than
i
prefer
a
brown
ale
now
o
the
flavors
of
this
beer
are
light
and
would
pair
well
with
lots
of
different
styles
of
food
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
though
this
would
not
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
lightly
revised
upon
tasting
on
tap
in
june
2013
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
definitely
top
5
in
my
brown
beers
highly
recommended
o
a
enjoyable
dark
beer
a
bit
richer
flavor
than
i
was
anticipating
from
the
bottles
well
balanced
description
o
a
very
solid
brown
ale
no
problems
with
it
at
all
not
overly
complex
or
crazy
but
very
solid
a
really
solid
brown
ale
when
i
think
of
a
good
brown
ale
these
are
the
flavors
and
aromas
i
think
of
o
sweet
josie
offering
a
smooth
voluptuous
body
and
excellent
taste
is
one
seductive
brown
ale
through
and
through
roast
notes
push
this
beer
towards
porter
borders
while
its
round
sweetness
and
drinkability
offers
a
nice
balance
id
kill
for
a
few
of
these
on
a
cool
fall
day
very
solid
brown
ale
sweet
but
not
cloying
id
like
to
try
this
fresh
palo
santo
this
beer
is
not
it
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
though
and
one
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
again
this
is
a
good
pub
beer
to
be
enjoyed
with
a
burger
or
on
the
deck
with
pals
overall
pretty
good
brown
ale
too
high
octane
for
a
session
beer
but
i
could
certainly
enjoy
a
few
of
these
overall
its
pretty
good
quite
a
light
beer
really
none
of
the
aspects
are
overwhelming
at
all
but
theres
a
nice
mixture
of
characteristics
and
delicate
flavours
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
half
finger
head
with
some
lacing
dissipated
within
a
few
minutes
very
nice
color
a
deep
brown
slightly
ruby
smelled
of
roasted
nuts
but
only
minimally
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
medium
body
with
a
bold
mouthfeel
definite
taste
of
chocolate
malts
with
a
bit
of
nuts
and
hint
of
coffee
hops
are
noticeable
as
well
as
the
alcohol
a
bittersweet
brown
overall
very
nice
american
brown
o
a
decent
brown
a
little
sweet
for
the
style
hence
the
name
sweet
josie
this
was
pretty
good
but
i
had
higher
hopes
for
a
brown
ale
its
got
a
lot
of
good
malt
caramel
flavor
and
a
decent
laced
foam
head
the
6
1
abv
is
nice
too
its
just
missing
that
it
factor
but
overall
i
did
enjoy
it
and
thought
it
was
good
from
my
home
tap
this
one
looks
gorgeous
in
the
glass
with
a
warm
reddish
deepbutstilltranslucent
medium
brown
color
and
capped
by
a
thick
foamy
tan
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
after
every
sip
the
aroma
is
likewise
thoroughly
enticing
with
a
dry
bittersweet
chocolate
character
and
a
bit
of
minerality
the
flavor
is
similarly
only
slightly
sweet
with
a
slight
bready
sweetness
creeping
into
the
mostly
dry
roasty
chocolaty
profile
the
flavor
is
also
a
bit
grainy
and
astringent
however
especially
in
the
aftertaste
which
detracts
from
the
nice
balance
of
flavors
the
light
body
and
light
carbonation
helps
it
all
go
down
smoothly
though
overall
this
one
doesnt
slide
too
far
to
either
the
sweet
or
the
bitter
sides
of
the
spectrum
making
it
an
easytodrink
yet
flavorful
brown
ale
strong
malty
aroma
has
notes
of
yeast
cinnamon
and
caramel
and
just
a
hint
of
molasses
it
pours
a
somewhat
transparent
warm
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
and
finebubbled
tan
head
flavor
does
not
quite
live
up
to
the
aroma
having
malty
caramel
and
cinnamon
notes
but
a
bit
of
a
metallic
tang
and
a
bitter
undertone
that
is
not
hoppy
texture
has
average
body
and
only
a
little
fizz
well
maybe
this
bottle
came
from
a
notsohot
batch
a
decent
ale
nonetheless
give
it
a
try
overall
a
well
put
together
brown
ale
that
is
not
too
sweet
and
has
decent
bitterness
glad
i
was
able
to
try
overall
a
fantastic
brown
ale
that
had
just
the
right
amount
of
bitter
sweetness
and
a
surprising
hoppiness
at
the
end
o
i
enjoyed
this
brown
ale
there
were
notes
of
chocolate
and
toffee
and
even
softer
notes
of
nuts
the
body
was
never
too
sweet
or
heavy
so
you
could
have
more
than
just
one
mouthfeel
is
decent
in
this
one
nothing
special
but
there
is
a
nice
pinch
of
hops
and
a
light
carbonation
that
i
keep
thinking
should
be
bigger
smooth
and
slick
with
a
malt
finish
that
seems
to
cover
your
teeth
long
after
its
gone
a
tasty
beverage
with
more
flavor
then
i
was
expecting
good
for
those
who
like
the
dark
beers
and
well
worth
checking
out
id
buy
again
in
a
minute
the
cpj
o
a
pleasant
surprise
to
find
in
the
snackdrink
area
in
the
lobby
of
the
courtyard
marriott
just
a
short
distance
from
the
raleighdurham
airport
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
would
definitely
have
another
o
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
that
is
worth
trying
the
earthiness
is
pretty
dominant
making
it
a
bit
unique
but
not
tailored
for
my
tastes
this
is
a
wonderful
brown
ale
definitely
worth
getting
a
keg
of
also
a
good
judge
of
a
beer
in
my
opinion
is
how
the
guys
oogle
over
it
and
choose
it
over
everything
else
in
the
fridge
it
is
that
kind
of
beer
and
even
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
brown
i
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
it
i
also
just
like
lone
rider
even
though
this
and
shotgun
betty
are
really
their
two
best
at
the
moment
still
if
you
are
in
the
raleigh
or
durham
nc
area
and
have
to
visit
a
tavern
go
to
big
boss
big
bosss
ales
especially
the
stuff
like
the
wooden
monkey
they
made
these
for
a
while
then
stopped
why
and
sneak
attack
a
short
run
are
awesome
even
though
they
dont
have
them
on
tap
at
the
tavern
anyway
i
digress
sweet
josie
is
a
must
buy
and
get
a
keg
drinkability
is
solid
as
is
this
brew
a
nice
punch
flavor
but
smooth
and
balanced
overall
this
beer
was
okay
but
i
probably
wouldnt
have
it
again
any
time
soon
unless
there
wasnt
much
selection
mediumfull
body
with
a
good
efdervescence
ever
so
lightly
warming
a
very
good
beer
overall
a
fairly
average
brown
ale
easy
to
drink
and
fits
the
style
fine
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
light
lacing
of
head
nose
offers
caramel
and
nutty
malts
taste
is
caramel
then
nutty
then
coffee
yeah
i
think
thats
what
that
was
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
smooth
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
lonerider
continues
to
impress
o
this
is
a
good
brew
from
the
south
that
can
always
be
enjoyed
i
would
take
more
anytime
when
i
think
of
brown
ales
i
really
dont
think
of
complexity
and
when
i
find
one
that
is
seriously
complex
its
a
shock
and
unfortunately
raises
the
bar
for
the
style
ive
had
some
brown
ales
that
have
completely
blown
me
away
before
much
like
dogfish
heads
indian
brown
ale
but
its
nothing
typical
for
the
style
sweet
josie
was
a
very
solid
example
of
a
base
line
traditional
american
brown
not
bad
overall
a
really
good
solid
brown
ale
that
these
guys
make
lonerider
hit
a
homerun
here
my
friends
a
beer
for
all
seasons
sweet
josie
is
sexy
built
and
fun
to
be
with
o
overall
one
of
the
better
regular
brown
ales
out
there
im
admittedly
not
the
biggest
brown
ale
fan
and
find
many
of
them
to
be
plain
but
this
one
is
full
of
flavor
and
quite
nice
o
good
but
a
bit
too
sweet
i
love
the
man
with
no
name
picture
on
the
crown
okay
got
this
on
tap
at
icehouse
nice
color
brown
fitting
nice
head
and
good
lacing
the
smell
was
okay
probably
the
only
lacking
characteristic
the
taste
was
pretty
good
nice
layering
and
super
subtle
nothing
overpowering
anywhere
nice
blend
the
mouthfeel
was
the
same
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
really
a
pretty
good
brown
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
nice
extra
to
throw
in
thanks
dsc
i
believe
have
tried
this
beer
on
tap
at
a
few
different
locations
including
a
brewery
tour
beautiful
brown
color
with
a
great
chocolate
caramel
smell
very
smooth
mouthfeel
with
exeptional
sweet
taste
this
is
a
very
exceptional
well
balanced
brown
ale
i
look
forward
to
lonerider
expanding
their
beer
portfolio
awesome
beers
guys
drink
this
was
a
nice
extra
and
i
am
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
if
i
am
ever
in
nc
i
will
have
to
visit
this
brewery
on
tap
at
sticks
and
sones
in
greensboro
poured
from
the
tap
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
deep
roasted
chesnut
brown
with
some
ruby
tingea
12
finger
beige
colored
head
atop
aromas
were
a
little
light
with
chocolate
malts
mainly
sticking
out
with
light
roastiness
as
well
well
rounded
on
the
palate
with
sweetish
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
brown
sugarfirm
graininess
and
light
earth
in
the
finish
to
keep
it
balanced
a
pretty
rich
tasting
brownone
of
the
better
browns
i
have
had
in
a
while
i
gotta
say
had
this
in
the
bottle
at
a
friends
house
hes
a
big
lonerider
fan
which
i
am
still
trying
to
understand
maybe
he
met
a
girl
there
or
a
girl
works
there
that
he
likes
who
knows
anyway
it
had
a
nice
deep
brown
appearance
no
real
head
to
speak
of
lots
of
brown
sugar
in
the
smell
i
will
say
that
the
smell
matches
the
flavor
okay
body
with
a
little
carbonation
i
hear
this
beer
won
a
gold
not
sure
if
it
was
this
one
or
not
my
friend
has
a
tendency
to
talk
up
lonerider
but
it
was
an
okay
brown
i
may
have
to
disagree
with
him
a
bit
and
give
it
a
better
than
average
ranking
overall
an
average
brown
ale
nothing
offensive
and
easy
drinking
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
fairly
decent
ale
good
flavors
enjoyable
experience
not
stellar
but
a
good
execution
clear
deep
brown
color
with
a
thin
creamy
offwhite
head
nutty
caramel
malt
and
chocolate
aroma
hint
of
maple
and
brown
sugar
sweet
cocoa
and
caramel
malty
flavor
with
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
pretty
well
balanced
though
not
as
smooth
as
id
like
medium
bodied
fine
carbonation
and
a
bit
drying
a
well
made
standard
brown
ale
d
a
decent
brew
and
it
would
be
worth
a
purchase
no
doubt
i
am
leary
of
the
chocolate
and
coffee
not
complementing
each
other
in
flavor
rather
than
nose
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
textured
head
lots
of
sticky
lacing
lines
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
it
empties
interesting
aroma
toasted
malts
mixed
nuts
and
a
hint
of
pine
trees
wow
this
is
good
think
caramel
biscuits
with
some
bite
im
pretty
sure
its
the
hops
that
is
giving
it
the
bite
but
i
cant
quite
place
the
flavor
its
kind
of
an
earthy
spicy
hop
this
is
really
good
and
my
review
doesnt
give
it
justice
good
crisp
mouthfeel
and
very
quaffable
im
very
impressed
with
the
2
beers
ive
had
from
lonerider
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
d
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
almost
refreshing
although
its
not
the
most
flavorful
still
good
d
this
was
a
drinkable
brown
but
not
as
good
for
me
as
smuttynoses
old
brown
dog
or
brooklyn
brown
d
the
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
would
be
a
good
accompaniment
with
food
because
the
flavors
in
the
taste
arent
very
strong
draft
at
tap
city
raleigh
overall
it
was
pretty
damn
solid
and
an
easy
to
drink
brown
ale
on
a
hot
day
on
tap
at
the
hideout
with
an
overall
light
feel
i
hope
lonerider
keeps
the
new
beers
comingatsprings0
great
brown
ale
du
claw
puts
out
some
very
delicious
brews
rich
flavor
with
a
sweet
aroma
o

i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
just
a
mass
of
different
candy
flavors
maybe
this
isnt
for
everyone
but
i
really
like
it
at
5
8
i
didnt
expect
a
massive
body
so
i
wasnt
surprised
it
was
a
little
thin
o
a
nice
afterdinner
beer
almost
dessert
quality
it
still
has
a
connection
to
its
brown
ale
base
but
the
coconut
and
cocoa
flavors
take
it
in
a
new
enjoyable
direction
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
its
a
thin
bodied
beer
a
bit
watered
down
but
it
has
a
great
flavor
and
aroma
i
would
recommend
it
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
coconut
and
the
chocolate
adds
a
nice
finishing
touch
o
the
flavors
of
coconut
vanilla
and
chocolate
overwhelm
the
flavors
of
the
base
beer
which
is
unfortunate
i
wish
they
were
more
complementary
rather
than
dominating
additionally
the
coconut
flavor
is
slightly
artificial
not
sure
i
would
grab
this
one
again
lots
of
coconut
chcocolate
caramel
and
vanilla
f
high
carbonation
is
nice
especially
given
the
heavy
flavors
overall
a
very
interesting
and
quite
good
beer
i
like
the
earthy
aromas
and
flavors
id
certainly
get
it
again
only
my
second
duclaw
beer
i
have
tried
pours
a
russet
brown
with
a
creamy
textured
light
beige
head
atop
that
leaves
an
almost
full
ring
of
lace
as
it
settles
into
a
frothy
mass
toasted
coconut
stands
out
in
the
nose
along
with
mild
milk
chocolate
although
not
a
fan
of
coconut
its
pleasant
on
the
palate
and
goes
well
with
the
chocolate
notes
again
not
a
fan
of
coconut
so
much
but
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
very
tasty
beer
seems
like
there
is
a
coffee
taste
as
well
to
me
look
is
quite
lackluster
in
the
glass
with
minimal
head
and
body
color
that
is
kinda
brownpurplish
has
a
very
nice
vanilla
and
slight
coconut
sweet
smell
taste
is
that
of
a
very
typical
brown
ale
though
nothing
really
noteworthy
here
and
a
quite
bitter
finish
as
well
along
with
some
burnt
roasty
notes
body
and
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
overall
this
is
just
a
very
pedestrian
brown
ale
and
not
the
most
enjoyable
good
but
nothing
really
making
me
want
to
revisit
as
i
am
not
a
fan
of
coconut
please
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
feel
like
i
am
drinking
tropicana
suntan
lotion
and
would
prefer
not
to
well
it
certainly
is
an
interesting
little
freak
you
pick
up
some
coconut
in
the
smell
along
with
what
seems
like
chocolate
the
vanilla
is
faint
the
flavor
is
interesting
reminds
me
of
the
old
sno
ball
cake
by
hostess
which
i
was
not
a
fan
of
there
is
also
an
off
taste
on
the
finish
that
does
not
seem
like
a
bitter
overall
interesting
but
not
very
good

a
beer
that
taste
like
an
almond
joy
wow
its
a
hit
a
spot
a
diffrent
spot
then
the
other
beers
you
drink
but
if
you
enjoy
brown
ales
you
will
like
it
a
diffrent
taste
with
each
sip
overall
really
interesting
right
up
front
great
coconut
toasted
coconut
and
caramelfudge
flavors
balanced
and
drinkable
additionally
i
think
this
would
make
a
great
dessert
beer
and
it
would
probably
make
for
some
great
unusual
and
unexpected
food
pairings
for
straightforward
drinkability
however
the
coconut
ultimately
becomes
the
main
component
overshadowing
the
base
malts
and
its
not
really
compelling
enough
to
want
a
second
within
any
given
session
othis
was
the
last
one
in
my
six
pack
and
it
was
a
good
try
worth
purchasing
more
than
one
of
poured
into
tumbler
medium
brown
color
like
a
darker
iced
tea
smell
is
toasty
malt
with
caramel
sugar
and
coconut
taste
is
light
mouthfeel
but
not
watery
he
first
sip
was
good
but
got
to
be
sickening
i
drank
the
first
but
left
the
rest
alone
for
months
before
dumping
them
o
an
alright
beer
overall
but
a
bit
watery
and
fake
tasting
without
much
going
on
i
like
chocolate
and
coconut
but
this
just
tastes
like
a
mediocre
beer
with
a
shot
or
two
of
coconut
syrup
enjoyably
flavored
beer
but
perhaps
a
bit
strong
flavor
not
abv
or
feel
for
some
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cola
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
chocolate
some
coconut
taste
is
like
a
mounds
bar
yummy
and
tasty
some
alcohol
is
present
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
unique
beer
worth
seeking
out
mouthfeel
is
good
and
overall
a
good
beer
just
plain
horrible
by
far
the
best
thing
ive
ever
had
from
them
really
really
well
executed
love
the
combination
of
coconut
chocolate
and
caramel
this
one
is
like
drinking
a
beer
version
of
almond
joy
i
could
have
several
of
these
on
draft
at
duclaw
in
bowie
md
the
beer
is
chestnut
brown
with
some
russet
highlights
and
a
half
inch
of
soapy
tan
head
aromas
of
brown
bread
coconut
chocolate
chewy
caramel
candies
brown
sugar
toffee
coconut
and
toffee
are
the
dominant
flavors
followed
by
notes
of
chocolate
malt
caramel
a
dessert
type
beer
though
not
overly
sweet
bready
and
medium
bodied
a
fun
and
interesting
beer
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
overall
but
the
feel
and
bitterness
at
the
end
of
the
taste
actually
took
away
from
what
i
was
expecting
in
this
one
just
alight
o
overall
a
sweetly
caramelized
malting
similar
to
a
scotch
ale
a
sweet
brown
ale
that
may
be
a
bit
much
in
multiples
but
is
interesting
for
a
take
im
usually
a
pretty
big
fan
of
the
bottled
duclaw
beers
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
for
me
overall
this
is
another
interesting
beer
from
duclaw
brewed
with
roasted
malt
chocolate
coconut
and
caramel
how
they
worked
together
was
pretty
impressive
this
is
another
winner
from
this
brewer
from
baltimoremd
and
definitely
a
good
craft
gateway
beer
merely
delicious
with
the
added
ingredients
overall
this
is
a
winner
what
a
great
experimental
brew
i
had
my
doubts
with
this
since
most
beers
they
make
are
rather
lackluster
but
this
may
be
the
best
beer
i
had
from
them
to
date
i
have
never
experienced
such
robust
coconut
flavor
in
a
beer
so
if
thats
your
thing
buy
this
now
the
taste
has
a
good
amount
of
freshly
roasted
coconut
with
a
supporting
taste
of
cocoacaramel
and
malt
with
a
more
toasted
but
not
bready
flavor
overall
this
is
a
nice
brown
if
you
enjoy
coconut
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
dominated
by
the
adjuncts
which
is
fine
if
that
is
how
you
roll
i
would
prefer
those
flavors
simply
compliment
the
base
beer
instead
of
overwhelming
it
i
wont
order
this
again
overall
this
beer
is
the
sum
of
its
parts
a
lot
of
average
to
above
average
parts
make
it
a
pretty
good
beer
a
bit
gimmicky
but
enjoyable
and
tasty
a
12oz
glass
is
enough
though
a
pint
may
also
be
enjoyable
as
im
sure
this
beer
is
different
as
it
warms
overall
this
brewery
is
definitely
hit
or
miss
with
me
and
this
one
was
a
hit
loved
the
chocolate
stout
feel
and
loved
the
little
bit
of
coconut
that
came
through
with
all
of
the
chocolate
a
pretty
good
offering
you
should
check
it
out
drink
between
4550
degrees
dont
drink
too
cold
or
it
will
mute
a
lot
of
the
flavor
o
probably
not
something
i
would
look
for
again
but
i
did
like
this
easy
drinking
and
pretty
damn
close
to
a
girl
scout
cookie
o
decent
i
suspect
this
will
become
somewhat
popular
due
to
the
name
advertising
and
marketing
behind
it
just
like
with
sweet
baby
jesus
im
steadily
going
through
their
stuff
so
that
i
can
give
them
a
fair
shot
me
livingbeing
from
md
and
all
o
sweet
baby
jesus
fans
will
love
this
and
should
buytrade
for
this
immediately
to
me
its
a
bit
too
chemicaltasting
to
be
a
great
beer
but
dat
aroma
oh
dat
aroma
all
in
all
it
isnt
bad
at
all
certainly
not
a
stinker
like
old
flame
or
serum
was
d
a
unique
marriage
of
beer
and
desert
the
aroma
is
dynamite
but
the
overall
flavor
profile
struggles
a
tiny
bit
this
one
gets
an
a
for
effort
very
nice
brown
more
characteristic
of
a
porter
but
delicious
nonetheless
deep
and
complex
brown
ale
rich
chocolate
hits
you
on
first
taste
as
well
as
in
he
nose
a
slight
citrus
hop
punch
comes
through
on
the
back
end
medium
bodied
and
well
balanced
not
easy
to
find
a
better
brown
ale
sampler
in
hf
line
second
sample
tasted
after
edward
lots
of
dark
chocolate
on
the
nose
not
really
a
lover
of
brown
but
this
was
very
drinkable
i
found
that
after
in
warmed
up
a
bit
the
cacao
aroma
and
flavors
really
came
out
and
for
me
it
was
much
better
o
initially
was
thrown
off
by
more
bitterness
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
mellowed
out
into
a
nice
sweetness
the
roasty
chocolatey
flavors
give
it
a
bit
of
a
porter
feel
smooth
all
around
with
a
balance
struck
between
malts
and
hops
that
provides
both
equally
luscious
grains
with
not
roast
but
some
chocolate
mixes
well
with
citrus
and
earthy
hops
quite
dark
in
colour
crisp
hoppiness
in
aroma
and
a
fantaatic
brown
ales
are
a
bit
odd
sometimes
they
can
be
stellar
but
often
they
are
a
bit
dull
i
feel
like
this
could
actually
be
hoppier
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
very
tasty
with
a
solid
malt
profile
would
drink
again
its
a
damn
good
brown
ale
hopped
in
good
measure
and
definitely
an
american
take
on
the
style
just
happiness
my
peeps
cheers
all
second
brown
ale
of
the
evening
after
a
long
period
of
avoiding
the
style
first
one
was
phil
from
marshall
wharf
this
was
better
but
not
by
much
both
were
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
extremely
drinkable
reminded
me
a
bit
of
tootsie
rolls
light
with
nice
carmely
chocolaty
notes
intense
nose
of
hazelnut
these
are
back
in
mouth
and
give
a
strong
bitter
taste
quickly
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
and
hops
take
their
place
bitterness
is
strong
and
dry
and
chocolate
taste
remains
pours
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
aroma
is
unusually
pronounced
for
a
brown
ale
with
tons
of
chocolate
supported
by
roasty
grains
dark
coffee
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
mostly
roasted
chocolate
semidark
grains
on
the
front
end
with
a
nice
hop
balance
towards
the
finish
i
may
be
getting
hints
of
oatmeal
in
the
finish
as
well
the
grains
are
so
predominant
that
some
can
be
picked
out
brown
malt
dehusked
black
medium
roast
crystal
maybe
some
toasted
oatmeal
and
each
one
presents
itself
without
muddling
the
others
i
used
to
think
hf
was
all
about
the
ipas
but
george
makes
me
realize
that
shaun
hills
dark
beers
should
be
as
highly
regarded
as
any
of
his
other
creations
if
you
like
this
you
will
like
everett
and
vice
versa
oone
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
come
across
lots
to
talk
about
with
this
one
i
love
getting
to
try
a
brown
ale
with
some
pop
to
it
very
well
made
overall
the
most
enjoyable
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
notes
bottled
4914
at
hf
and
consumed
on
the
suggested
drink
by
date
of
41714
poured
into
a
hf
2l
growler
o
overall
hill
does
it
again
as
someone
who
does
not
tend
to
like
many
browns
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
is
it
blowing
me
away
no
but
is
it
a
true
brown
ale
that
has
very
solid
characteristics
absolutely
i
would
go
as
far
as
to
say
its
the
best
brown
ale
i
have
had
yet
to
date
dark
brown
pour
with
head
gradually
reducing
to
fine
lacing
roasty
malts
coffee
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
flavors
are
a
bit
watered
down
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
oily
with
smooth
creamy
active
carbonation
quaffable
im
keeping
this
short
because
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
but
not
great
o
not
sure
where
the
soapy
note
came
from
possibly
the
tap
line
or
the
glass
otherwise
not
as
tasty
as
everett
but
with
more
substance
this
is
truly
a
brown
ale
probably
the
best
brown
ale
ill
ever
taste
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
is
a
brown
ale
based
off
the
description
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
a
hop
forward
version
but
its
very
true
to
style
nutty
malt
dominated
the
flavor
and
the
hops
round
everything
out
hazy
brown
in
appearance
with
cascading
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
about
a
finger
of
fluffy
white
head
when
poured
and
the
mouth
feel
with
the
amount
of
carb
in
this
beer
really
helped
to
push
the
flavor
smelled
like
every
other
brown
ale
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
based
off
of
all
the
brown
ales
ive
had
this
was
by
far
the
best
tasting
o
simple
but
simply
perfectly
done
it
doesnt
excite
me
but
it
nails
the
style
down
nicely
overall
its
a
very
good
brown
ale
the
style
is
nothing
super
special
or
variable
and
this
is
no
exception
no
need
to
take
a
trip
to
the
moon
to
get
this
beer
but
if
it
happens
to
be
available
when
you
want
a
brown
ale
then
its
definitely
a
good
one
to
drink
pour
is
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
nose
is
heavily
roasted
malt
with
notes
of
roasted
coffee
hint
of
vanilla
dark
chalky
malts
taste
is
a
touch
less
roasty
more
malt
richness
with
some
fudge
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
fairly
clean
and
no
sugars
left
over
rich
body
not
heavy
nice
carb
great
feel
had
this
on
tap
at
blackback
pub
was
just
ok
compared
to
the
other
hf
brews
great
still
was
an
hard
to
judge
this
coming
off
such
great
brews
besides
its
super
fresh
and
classic
great
body
nothing
jumped
out
to
me
ironically
had
i
had
this
amongst
othernon
hf
brews
it
would
of
probably
been
mind
blowing
o
smell
and
taste
were
a
little
underwhelming
but
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
tried
it
because
i
was
at
the
brewery
and
the
opportunity
presented
itself
the
beer
is
mahogany
with
a
small
bubbly
beige
head
the
aroma
offers
dank
hops
and
brown
bread
rolled
together
as
one
caramel
malt
sweet
chewy
candies
the
flavor
follows
suit
well
balanced
and
flavorful
with
caramel
and
toffee
tones
highly
drinkable
a
solid
example
of
the
style

decadent

nice
showcase
of
malts
with

some

is
on
the
lgiht
side
very
well
executed
brown
ale
and
as
good
as
it
can
be
for
me
i
do
prefer

decadent
but
drinkable
one
of
the
finest
beers
i
have
ever
had
worth
searching
high
and
low
for
i
enjoyed
the
nutty
sweetness
but
could
do
without
bitterness
a
very
rich
and
satisfying
brown
ale
though
not
like
one
that
ive
ever
tasted
before
definitely
worth
a
try
quite
interesting
and
unique
im
actually
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
in
general
however
i
have
a
strong
preference
towards
robust
browns
that
are
less
roasty
with
a
bigger
malt
presence
george
delivers
on
all
fronts
here
its
sweet
and
not
too
bitter
with
a
light
feel
that
is
at
the
same
time
full
and
very
smooth
this
is
certainly
a
top
tier
brown
o
a
nice
brown
ale
with
good
flavor
good
balance
on

the
prohibition

pours
a

almost
black
color

inch
of
frothy
head

on

malts

earth

taste
is
of
malts
upfront
with
earth
and
brown
sugar
nutty
with
a
slight
citrus
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
a
really
good
brown
ale
worth
having
again
overall
quality
beer
as
always
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
an
excellent
brown
medium
body
well
carbonated
chewy
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
a
wellexecuted
hopped
up
brown
ale
yes
please
o
a
solid
brown
ale
the
hops
mesh
well
with
the
base
flavors
allowing
it
to
still
be
drinkable
while
still
having
lots
of
flavor
great
to
revisit
this
one
after
a
few
years
o
very
all
around
well
balanced
brown
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
you
really
cant
go
wrong
here
ultimately
this
is
a
luscious
beer
with
a
very
vague
style
bale
slapped
on
it
which
doesnt
do
it
justice
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
head
head
persists
nicely
and
some
lacing
present
aroma
is
dark
malts
but
nice
flavor
is
great
with
chocolate
upfront
along
with
a
good
mix
of
malts
on
the
back
it
has
a
peppery
spice
sweet
yet
somewhat
dry
a
really
nicely
balanced
beer
o
overall
not
my
favorite
hf
beer
and
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
good
brown
ale
easy
to
drink
and
lots
of
roasted
and
toasted
nuts
would
have
it
again
and
would
be
a
great
brown
ale
for
people
getting
into
craft
beers
but
wouldnt
strain
myself
to
seek
it
out
like
i
would
most
of
their
other
beers
owow
a
great
well
rounded
brown
ale
great
flavors
and
it
has
the
tad
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
make
it
a
great
beer
o
at
first
i
was
unimpressed
as
the
beer
warms
it
develops
more
character
in
the
nose
flavor
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
or
stand
out
above
the
rest
of
the
beers
of
this
style
but
thats
one
of
the
issues
with
populardelicious
breweries
like
hf
expectations
are
always
high
going
in
so
when
one
doesnt
meet
the
high
standards
it
disappoints
i
am
trying
to
be
as
objective
as
possible
and
put
all
assumptions
aside
great
beer
overall
probably
the
first
brown
ale
ive
ever
enjoyed
pours
a
clear
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
roasted
nuts
and
some
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
nice
nutty
finish
and
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
black
color
with
a
decent
sized
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
a
healthy
shot
of
earthy
citrus
and
pine
to
provide
some
balance
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
sweet
caramel
bread
and
chocolate
maltiness

flavor
light
hop
bitterness
provides
nice
balance
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
grainy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
damn
fine
brown
ale
right
here
its
tough
to
get
a
great
brown
ale
because
the
style
is
a
bit
on
the
boring
side
but
this
is
an
exceptional
example
george
is
easily
the
most
underrated
hf
brew
arguably
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
and
i
want
more
o
this
was
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
and
definitely
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
for
a
hf
beer
it
wasnt
anything
spectacular
it
definitely
had
a
nice
roasted
malt
and
slight
coffee
presence
with
a
high
drinkability
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
i
would
recommend
trying
it
but
not
going
out
of
your
way
to
get
it
medium
bodied
with
an
odd
medicinal
feel
and
weird
combination
of
sweet
and
roasted
malt
spice
and
citrusy
hops
hints
of
licorice
anise
sweet
chocolate
and
vinous
dark
fruit
finished
slightly
bitter
with
citrusy
hops
and
a
lingering
unpleasant
aftertaste
overall
a
superior
brown
ale
outstanding
george
is
brown
like
the
style
would
suggest
hes
acually
veering
towards
black
with
a
silky
liquid
look
a
nice
puff
of
tannishbrown
foam
up
top
leaving
some
smell
is
rich
with
a
nice
toasted
malt
base
and
there
is
a
blast
of
fresh
hops
some
sweet
scents
with
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
smoke
bread
with
warming
this
is
quite
full
of
flavor
normal
browns
dont
get
this
involved

of
roastytoasty
malt
with
a
hit
of
citrus
hops
surrounded
by
some
nuts
smoke
brown
sugar
and
some
earthy
flavors
i
like
the
body
on
this
its
richer
and
fuller
than
most
browns
nicely
carbed
not
dead
in
any
way
with
a
full
aftertaste
that
does
not
linger
to
long
a
nice
drinkable
brown
ale
that
is
good
for
two
glasses
or
so
not
boring
this
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
im
going
to
look
for
more
of
their
beers
a
tasty
brown
ale
that
improves
in
flavor
as
it
warms

the
taste

isnt
too
out
of
place
for
the
style
in
general
better
than
many
brown
ales
ive
had
medium
body
a
bit
chalky
but
still
decent
overall
hf
never
stops
proving
they
are
a
superb
brewing
co
and
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
get
it
if
you
see
it
do
not
hesitate
pours
a
dark
but
not
opaqure
dark
brown
shade
with
a
thin
head
the
nose
is
just
absent
maybe
my
sniffer
is
operating
under
less
than
full
capacity
but
i
dong
get
anything
at
all
very
muted
nose
indeed
i
dont
know
what
it
is
im
tasting
but
im
not
digging
it
at
all
very
roasty
with
some
dark
fruit
going
on
figs
plub
cherries
a
bit
smoky
yeah
not
my
bag
the
mouthfeel
is
the
bright
point
here
smooth
highly
carbed
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
overally
this
is
a
rare
miss
for
hf
where
im
concerned
i
just
didnt
think
this
came
together
very
well
one
of
the
most
interesting
brown
ales
that
i
have
had
the
chance
to
try
and
i
am
very
glad
that
i
did
hill
farmstead
hits
a
delicate
balance
of
an
overbittered
brown
ale
that
didnt
just
turn
into
a
dark
ipa
and
their
ability
to
infuse
the
citrus
with
the
coffee
and
raisin
bread
character
of
the
beer
is
nothing
short
of
masterful
o
of
the
few
abas
that
ive
had
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
george
is
easily
the
best
something
about
that
hop
schedule
puts
it
in
another
league
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
quite
nice
although
not
as
lively
as
some
other
examples
of
the
style
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
style
so
usually
overlooked
not
too
chocolatey
or
too
much
in
the
direction
of
a
porter
george
is
a
solid
brown
ale
and
is
right
up
there
with
russian
river
if
a
bit
more
aggressive
o
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
described
as
a
hoppy
brown
but
its
even
a
larger
dose
of
columbus
then
i
was
expecting
hey
i
like
hoppy
beers
but
i
like
my
brown
ales
to
have
more
of
a
malty
sweetness
and
less
hopfocused
d
the
combination
of
brown
ale
and
columbus
hops
just
doesnt
work
for
me
and
this
is
by
far
the
least
enjoyable
beer
ive
had
from
hill
farmstead
the
flavor
profile
is
exactly
what
youd
expect
from
the
description
but
the
concept
seems
problematic
oh
well
even
mozart
wrote
the
occasional
bad
piece
perhaps
this
beer
would
pair
nicely
with
the
flute
harp
concerto
k
299
this
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
light
making
its
way
through
there
is
a
nice
light
tan
head
on
topmtha
fades
rather
slowly
the
smell
is
earthy
floral
hops
up
front
with
a
nice
roasted
and
sweet
malt
finish
the
flavor
is
pretty
similar
to
the
smell
with
there
being
a
bit
more
than
expected
hop
profile
the
malts
come
about
a
bit
more
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
shaun
said
the
next
batch
has
had
the
hops
toned
down
a
bit
cant
wait
to
try
it
o
so
far
this
is
my
least
favourite
hill
farmstead
to
date
that
being
said
this
is
still
a
great
brown
ale
just
perhaps
i
hold
hill
farmstead
to
such
a
high
bar
that
this
just
falls
short
for
me
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with

a
massive
frothy

earthy

and
light
coffee
strong
roast
malt
flavor
in
the
body
with
brown
sugar
and
cocoa
but
the
sweetness
is
well
balanced
by
pine
and
grassy
hops
dry
and
bitter
finish
with
a
silky
light
medium
body
and
soft
carbonation
a
brown
ale
is
a
brown
ale
is
a
brown
ale
generally
but
i
enjoyed
this
compared
to
most
and
thought
the
mild
bitterness
of
the
hops
added
a
unique
turn
to
this
overall
nice
hoppier
than
expected
tasty
though
brown
ales
are
not
among
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
clearly
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
one
i
enjoy
really
happy
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
marc
thanks
for
sending
this
along
overall
im
happy
i
was
able
to
try
this
beer
especially
given
its
limited
status
at
this
point
im
not
generally
a
huge
fan
of
this
genre
brown
bitters
o
solid
brown
ale
comes
with
a
bitter
blast
that
is
a
bit
counter
to
the
seemingly
great
brown
ale
beneath
if
you
are
a
fan
of
bitterness
you
will
probably
love
this
one
is
this
a
typical
brown
ale
no
it
is
rather
an
extrapolation
of
the
style
i
must
admit
myself
suspicious
of
the
term
double
applied
to
a
brown
ale
but
this
certainly
justifies
the
term
it
remains
brown
alelike
and
does
not
spread
into
the
real

what
you
want
this
is
a
very
tasty
brown

it
pours
nicely
with
a
frothy
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
i
didnt
get
much
aroma
from
it
a
bit
of
burnt
sugar
and
faint
hops
however
when
this
beer
hits
your
taste
buds
it
comes
into
its
own
there
is
plenty
of
chocolate
and
dark
roast
coffee
with
a
lovely
hop
finish
carbonation
is
minimal
which
lends
an
extra
level
of
quaffability
to
this

ill
be

good

first
clown

beer
ive
tried
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
no
more
no
less
bomber
poured
into
a
mason
jar
mug
a
dark
reddish
cloudy
root
beer
brown
with
a
light
ring
of
beige

rimming
the
glass
i
dont
mind
the
label
either

of
dark

herbs
and

cherry
brittle

instant
coffee
crystals
with
whitener
and
faint
floral
hops
ive
seen
better
looking
beers
but
the
aroma
is
solid
i
dig
the
notion
of
a
double
brown
and
this
does
deliver
some
rich
nutty
malts
roughly
congruent
with
the
nose
plus
some
light
molasses
raisin
malted
milk
candy
and
a
wee
bit
of
drupe
fruit
perhaps
rather
sweet
up
front
but
gets
bitter
during
the
tail
end
albeit
not
harshly
so
floral
hops
combine
with
dark
malts
to
yield
a
tobaccolike
vibe
sweet
pipe
tobacco
as
opposed
to
cigar
sturdy
mediumheavy
body
with
more
carbonation
than
expected
but
this
does
not
detract
finish
is
bitter
chocolate
plus
lightly
resinous
hops
which
oddly
enough
works
quite
well
i
am
an
inveterate
clown
shoes
imbiber
and
this
is
an
essential
part
of
the
canon
hits
most
or
all
of
the
different
dark
malt
notes
without
going
overboard
on
the
roasted
elements
like
a
stout
might
and
has
a
more
hefty
body
and
flavor
than
do
lesser
brown
ales
o
nice
brown
ale
well
carbonated
but
not
ridiculously
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
great
head
and
impressive
look
smell
is
to
me
the
weakest
aspect
of
this
beer
smells
of
caramel
hops
and
light
floral
notes
the
taste
is
quite
nutty
and
warming
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
overall
a
very
solid
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
pretty
solid
beer
with
good
flavors
and
plenty
of
hops
to
balance
things
out
i
might
pick
up
another
bottle
and
see
how
it
does
after
six
months
o
not
the
best
by
clown
shoes
it
could
be
the
style
as
i
have
not
had
it
in
a
long
while
i
was
disappointed
american
brown
ale
why
the
hell
not
truth
in
advertising
is
not
said
nations
strong
suit
way
more
amber
than
brown
and
with
a
few
smoky
and
hoppy
notions
more
aligned
with
the
nascent
black
ale
denomination
im
at
a
virtual
loss
as
to
whether
this
one
comes
anywhere
near
the
ballpark
talk
like
a
native
they
wont
know
of
the
purported
style
ok
on
to
my
actual
baggagefree
impression
ummm
tastes
good
to
me
more
people
need
to
make
good
brown
ales
in
my
opinion
i
thought
brown
angel
was
great
the
first
beer
from
clown
shoes
i
bought
was
this
for
nothing
other
than
the
artwork
on
the
bottle
but
i
became
a
big
fan
the
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
head
which
sticks
a
bit
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
sweet
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
walnuts
coming
through
the
taste
was
more
subtle
with
roasted
malt
and
barley
coming
through
with
a
nice
clean
finish
the
only
thing
im
not
a
giant
fan
of
is
its
a
little
thin
but
easily
overlooked
i
love
this
beer
because
its
the
beer
that
got
me
into
clown
shoes
as
a
whole
it
tends
towards
the
sweeter
side
but
its
really
good
rjt
strong
flavours
that
open
up
nicely
an
enjoyable
beer
to
have
now
and
then
overall
this
is
a
rich
tasting
brown
ale
it
has
the
flavor
of
a
good
stout
with
the
body
of
an
ale
in
a
blind
tasting
it
could
pass
for
a
medium
bodied
stout
this
is
a
very
successful
beer
and
what
exactly
is
a
double
brown
ale
a
dubble
extra
hops
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
very
nice
example
of
a
hoppy
brown
ale
it
had
pretty
much
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
shorts
good
humans
which
is
a
good
thing
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
not
too
filing
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
bomber
to
myself
and
if
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
this
style
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
bottles
without
getting
tired
of
it
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
beer
was
the
balance
it
was
pretty
much
prefect
and
no
aspect
was
too
overpowering
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
nutty
flavor
didnt
come
through
a
little
more
but
it
wasnt
that
big
of
a
deal
but
i
think
it
would
make
it
a
slightly
better
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
wouldnt
be
something
i
buy
a
lot
of
but
having
a
bottle
in
the
fridge
for
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
hoppy
brown
ale
would
be
a
good
thing
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
doesnt
mind
their
brown
ales
on
the
hoppier
side
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
was
just
what
i
wanted
it
to
be
and
i
thought
it
was
pretty
enjoyable
good
job

as
i
poured
the

the

would
benefit
from
a
touch

slightly
slick
with

well
deserving

from
the
boat

of

these
guys
threw
into
this
brew
overall
i
wanted
it
to
love
it
since
the
label
is

but
its
just
okay
for
me
this

takes
a
fairly

and

into

worthwhile
not
the
first
time
ive
had
this
and
not
the

it

with
some
piney
citrus
hops
toasted
and
balanced
brown
ale
here
medium
bodied
brew
with
an
even
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
brown
o
i
had
high
hopes
but
the
thin
body
does
it
in
for
me
this
beer
has
a
lightmedium
body
probably
due
to
seemingly
heavy
carbonation
it
finishes
with
just
a
little
film
left
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
given
that
my
favorite
styles
are
dipa
american
black
barleywine
and
imperial
stout
its
possible
that
i
am
underrating
this
beer
due
to
purely
personal
preferences
however
it
also
seemed
to
be
significantly
overcarbonated
resulting
in
a
suboptimal
mouthfeel
a
rather
good
brown
ale
the
alcohol
heat
becomes
increasingly
more
noticeable
after
a
few
sips
and
somewhat
distracts
from
the
malt
and
hop
character
but
by
and
large
it
lives
up
to
its
double
styling
with
big
bold
flavors
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
thick
beige
head
that
dissipates
very
slowly
there
are
lots
of
visible
streaming
bubbles
that
can
be
seen
on
the
side
of
the
glass
lots
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
there
are
aromas
of
brown
malt
toffee
nuts
chocolate
and
some
floral
hops
hit
the
nose
the
flavors
do
follow
the
nose
theres
some
mild
toffee
sweetness
with
some
nuttiness
and
roastiness
from
the
malts
i
get
some
faint
chocolate
notes
and
plenty
of
back
end
bitterness
from
the
hops
there
are
also
some
citrus
notes
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
strong
carbonation
the
hops
and
malt
roastiness
remain
in
the
aftertaste
for
a
little
while
this
is
a
good
beer

the
aforementioned
triumvirate
of
dark
chocolatecoffeetoffee
hits
you
in
sequential
order
each
of
them
permeated
by
a
sweet
caramel
tinge
that
many
others
have
noted
the
nuttiness
found
in
the
aroma
is
present
throughout
the
entire
brew
and
it
reminds
me
of
a
pecan
at
times
in
the
way
it
complements
the
overall
creaminess
of
the
beer
as
the
beer
warms
a
spicy
hop
presence
becomes
increasingly
notable
much
like
the
tramp
stamp
ale
body
is
actually
pretty
light
and
theres
little
to
no
carbonation
to
offer
a
bite
on
the
tongue
finishes
incredibly
smooth
with
a
slightly
wet
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
all
night
this
one
is
a
pleasant
quaff
but
nothing
to
overwhelm
anyone
the
labels
are
pretty
cool
though
gotta
love
the
name
at
least
o
very
balanced
and
complex
flavors
are
on
the
bold
side
and
leave
me
contemplating
each
sip
an
extremely
well
done
brown
ale
i
recommend
this
one
o
very
good
brown
ale
might
be
my
favorite
esp
for
a
category
that
i
typically
find
dull
great
fall
beer
on
a

with
the
chocolate

chestnut
brown

with
slight

sporadic

on

i
get
light
roast
some
brown

and
a
little
sourness
flavor
is
malt
centric
with

blend
of
flavors
again
i
perceive
a
little
sourness
acidity
which
is
not

maybe
a

note
nice
brown

not

i
like
or
out

but
its
really
good
nice
brew
for
sure
clown
shoes
new
to
minnesota
grabbed
a
bottle
today
after
reading
the
label
and
thinking
it
sounded
pretty
good
hoppy
brown
ale
why
not
its
brown
so
far
so
good
smells
really
nice
very
fruity
and
hay
like
almost
reminds
me
of
a
well
hopped
pilsener
oddly
enough
slight
brown
aroma
as
well
toasty
and
roasty
a
bit
of
cold
press
coffee
there
hops
at
the
vanguard
citrus
floral
and
grassy
well
defined
fruit
contribution
seems
to
come
from
the
yeast
subtle
applepear
esters
the
brown
is
mellow
faintly
roasty
shit
ive
had
black
ipa
that
was
roastier
than
this
beer
there
is
a
caramel
character
in
there
thats
adds
a
nice
layer
to
the
hops
transitions
into
a
wonderful
bitter
estery
finish
great
body
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
just
perfect
this
is
one
hoppy
brown
ale
and
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
not
the
first
clown
shoes
beer
ive
enjoyed
and
im
sure
not
my
last
from
the
bomber
into
the
pint
glass
this
is
an
opaque
dark
brown
colored
ale
with
a
giant
mound
of
root
beer
float
tan
head
and
plenty
of
lace
remnants
the
aroma
is
a
very
tasteful
chocolate
malt
and
fruit
nougat
with
a
minty
herbal
accent
add
a
touch
of
pine
skunk
and
you
have
a
classy
nose
hit
the
flavor
follows
with
a
neat
marriage
of
sweet
chocolate
malt
and
funky
cabbagepine
hop
bite
really
interesting
and
tasty
with
a
creamy
feel
medium
bodied
with
subtle
carbonation
the
hops
are
very
classy
here
not
smashmouth
at
all
sort
of
swampyveggie
but
a
definite
key
to
this
wonderful
flavor
smooth
flavorful
and
different
very
nice
o
very
nice
brown
ale
bit
more
bitterness
then
i
expected
but
it
worked
well
with
the
dark
roasted
malts
clown

keeps
kicking
out

brews
and
this
is
no
exception
22
ounce
bottle
bottled
711
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
half
inch
tan
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
little
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
it
smells
like
toasted
malt
brown
sugar
toffee
nuts
and
some
citrus
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
nuts
toasted

brown
sugar
and
some
floral
and
citrusy
hops
theres
a
slight
bitter
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
with
there
being
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
i
think
its
a
decent
enough
brew
a
buddy
of
mine
picked
this
up
for
me
on
a
not
so
recent
trip
out
of
town
so
it
was
nice
to
try
it
hopefully
next
time
ill
have
a
fresher
bottle
good
but
i
did
this
beer
no
service
by
sitting
on
it
for
a
year
this
is
a
very
dark
brown
beer
with
hints
a
red
hues
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
is
fairly
thin
roughly
one
and
a
half
fingers
thick
and
wanes
considerably
into
a
layer
of
bubbles
and
lacing
medium
carbonation
and
a
slight
haze
fill
the
inner
body
of
this
beer
coffee
dark
chocolate
roasted
coffee
bean
fig
and
raisins
all
fill
your
nostrils
as
you
breathe
in
the
sweet
aromas
emanating
from
the
nectar
of
the
gods
the
mouth
feel
is
rather
light
and
dull
but
the
carbonation
is
very
present
the
flavor
is
mild
overall
sweet
bitter
when
it
hits
the
sides
of
your
mouth
and
it
fills
your
tongue
with
roasted
coffee
bean
mildly
roasted
malts
very
mild
hops
the
aftertaste
lingers
long
after
you
swallow
its
a
bit
harsh
and
slightly
bitter
and
is
dominated
by
roasted
malts
brown
sugar
and
mild
hops
i
think
i
just
found
my
new
favorite
brown
ale
22oz

lots
of

earth
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
mostly
of
caramel
malts
with
floral
hops
at
the
end
maybe
some
hints
of
chocolate
silky
mouthfeel
tastes
a

boozier

i

this

it

and
great

the

character
is
spot
on
with
just
enough
hop
character
for
balance
i
wish
this
came
in
six
packs
i
would
buy
them
for
sure
o
there
is
barely
a
single
thing
i
can
say
that
is
bad
on
this
this
is
an
exceptionally
well
done
beer
i
know
im
biased
towards
browns
but
is
this
really
this
good
by
the
end
of
the
22oz
i
was
ready
to
change
it
up
but
i
think
simply
the
notion
that
i
was
able
to
drink
22oz
of
any
brown
ale
kind
of
speaks
for
itself
as
i
fall
into
the
typical
kinda
meh
on
the
brown
ale
style
these
days
pours
a
murky
brown
with
an
explosively
large
khaki
head
that
eventually
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
and
nutty
aromas
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
a
medium
amount
of
bitterness
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
very
high
level
of
carbonation
that
is
just
too
much
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
as
it
stands
and
i
think
there
may
be
a
slight
infection
issue
with
the
huge
head
and
extreme
carbonation
that
this
particular
bottle
has
overall
not
bad
not
great
cant
help
but
compare
to
dfh
indian
brown
which
is
a
go
to
brown
for
me
odan
amped
up
brown
ale
several
flavor
components
i
am
starting
to
appreciate
brown
ales
more
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
browns
i
have
come
across
plenty
of
flavor
but
still
fairly
light
in
body
for
a
rather
high
abv
brew
clown
shoes
is
very
consistent
with
their
offerings
o
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
the
flavors
are
just
way
off
and
the
higher
alcohol
level
doesnt
really
help
this
brew
out
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
pours
out
a
medium
brown
beer
huge
ass
head
i
didnt
pour
too
hard
to
induce
it
either
smells
very
nice
has
major
porter
scents
to
it
coffeeroasted
scent
tastes
rather
like
a
porter
also
not
that
i
care
its
good
semi
sweet
malty
hoppy
an
ok
beer
as
i
get
closer
to
finishing
the
bottle
im
beginning
to
find
it
a
bit
average
overall
this
is
a
very
subpar
brown
ale
over
carbonated
and
no
real
malt
presence
i
will
never
have
this
one
again
overall
as
expected
it
was
a
hoppy
brown
odisappointing
lacks
balance
and
not
true
to
the
style
does
get
better
as
it
warms
decent
enough
drop
but
not
particularly
complex
or
full
and
tending
a
little
towards
unbalanced
ive
certainly
had
better
american
browns
but
this
one
does
the
job
if
unimaginatively
o
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
that
will
appeal
more
to
coffee
drinkers
because
that
is
what
the
flavor
is
more
geared
towards
nice
price
point
and
easy
to
drink
o
pretty
good
for
a
brown
ale
but
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
i
like
the
added
hoppiness
to
the
traditional
brown
ale
flavor
palette
i
could
and
would
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
strong
taste
and
is
rather
drinkable
overall
a
fantastic
and
wellconceived
beer
o
a
good
brown
very
complex
but
didnt
blow
me
away
pours
a
brown
copper
hue
which
leaves
a
three
finger
crater
head
and
creamy
lacingthe
smell
is
dark
fruitmolassesbrown
sugar
and
burnt
toffeethe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
has
tastes
of
brown
sugarraisinsmolassescoffeefigs
and
the
finish
is
a
tad
bitter
very
simialar
to
the
finish
of
a
coffee
and
overall
i
like
my
brown
ales
and
even
though
its
not
over
the
top
all
the
ingredients
work
and
i
would
drink
again
overall
pretty
interesting
brew
to
sample
and
pleasing
to
the
taste
tastes
like
thin
muddy
water
not
at
all
appealing
virtually
no
carbonation
left
after
the
explosive
head
formation
i
have
enjoyed
most
of
clown
shoes
offerings
and
was
disappointed
in
this
offering
i
can
only
assume
that
this
bottle
is
off
and
not
a
true
representation
nevertheless
its
all
ive
got
to
go
on
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
find
on
tap
at
a
barrestaurant
as
its
hop
bitterness
and
medium
malt
flavors
balance
well
with
almost
any
traditional
american
midscale
restaurant
food
i
have
avoided
this
beer
in
the
past
as
i
typically
do
not
enjoy
hoppy
brown
or
black
ales
but
this
wasnt
too
bad
probably
because
i
find
hops
are
mutedfall
off
in
kegbar
beer
and
because
it
paired
well
with
the
dinner
not
bad
worth
a
go
over
the
traditional
rubbish
most
restaurants
have
available
o
an
interesting
mix
between
a
brown
ale
and
stout
a
little
bitter
for
me
but
overall
quite
nice
goes
down
quite
easily
nothing
springs
to
mind
save
brown
sugar
and
jackie
brown
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
sweet
sienna
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
mocha
foam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
brown
sugar
nailed
it
light
coffee
light
cocoa
light
tobacco
a
touch
of
grass
and
a
kiss
of
cashew
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
coffee
is
a
bit
more
powerful
the
cocoa
is
darker
and
the
grass
has
morphed
into
some
earthy
cilantrolike
greens
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
creamy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
brown
something
i
could
easily
see
reaching
for
again
cheers
o
good
brown
ale
definitely
on
the
hoppy
side
of
the
spectrum
some
decent
bitterness
and
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
either
solid
example
of
the
style
i
do
love
the
coffee
its
very
robust
and
not
subtle
at
all
but
as
a
coffee
fan
its
a
good
thing
drinkability
is
a
tad
low
due
to
this
but
having
a
glass
was
awesome
o
i
am
a
lover
of
the
darker
ladies
so
when
one
recommend
this
to
me
i
had
to
try
she
was
spot
on
name
says
it
all
my
lady
friend
is
now
my
brown
angel
overall
very
good
more
hop
character
than
a
lot
of
brown
ales
which
i
like
d
hats
off
to
clown
shoes
for
producing
beers
that
have
yet
to
disappoint
and
are
very
creative
the
artwork
aint
too
bad
either
try
one
out
its
certainly
worth
the
pricetag
it
has
a
crisp
finish
with
a
little
more
carbonation
than
i
like
aftertaste
is
on
the
bitter
side
with
a
211
bottling
date
id
say
the
finishing
hops
columbus
and
amarillo
are
gone
even
still
its
pretty
simply
constructed
though
it
is
very
creamy
unimpressed
but
prepared
to
give
a
mulligan
for
this
one
o
on
the
whole
this
is
a
well
made
drinkable
beer
mo
more
chocolatecoffee
notes
come
out
while
warming
up
balancing
the
hops
nothing
mindblowing
though
pretty
good
brown
ale
here
woody
aroma
has
hints
of
caramel
and
pear
it
pours
a
dark
chocolaty
brown
that
lets
daylight
in
only
at
the
very
edges
the
sample
i
got
fizzed
like
crazy
so
be
careful
light
tan
head
is
quite
thick
finebubbled
and
persistent
crisp
flavor
has
caramel
malty
and
woody
notes
plus
hints
of
fruit
and
yeast
firmbodied
texture
has
a
lively
fizz
that
leaves
a
satisfying
and
tasty
finish
this
is
a
safe
bet
for
browns
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
pretty
good
this
frankly
wasnt
really
what
i
was
expecting
its
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
even
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
which
it
is
not
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
but
would
certainly
drink
it
if
i
happened
to
have
it
around
check
it
out
if
you
really
want
to
but
no
need
to
go
out
of
your
way
this
beer
is
a
murky

a
good

for

overall

nice

overall
a
very

beer
fits
the
american

a

hoppier
definitely
try
this

you
like
browns
and
a

with

nicely
smooth
and
rich

malty
up

on

maybe
a
little
too
much
hops
for
me
i
would
like
the
nice
cocoatoffee
malts
to
be
more
forward
they
seem
to
compliment
the
yeast
notes
well
i
like
it
well
enough
why
cant
they
make
this
shit
in
sixpacks
thats
a
shame
paying
6
bucks
for
a

of
this
makes
it
unlikely
to
buy
this

any
regularity

a

as

really

lacey

bitter
finish
in
a
word
nutty
brown
very
drinkable
hops
and
malting
is
so
balanced
better
than
its
rating
in
the
sense
that
i
would
serve
this
regular
to
people
if
available
down
the
street
great
for
the
style
d
browns
arent
my
favorite
but
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
medium
bodied
with
a
blast
of
dry
earthy
hops
which
are
slightly
dry
and
bitter
but
not
overpowering
the
floral
hop
flavor
lingers
over
the
sweet
notes
into
a
subtle
dry
finish
underneath
there
is
a
prominent
silky
malt
character
with
lots
of
chocolate
flavor
slightly
roasted
with
caramel
toffee
toast
and
nut
pretty
complex
and
decently
balanced
the
hops
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
so
that
the
malt
character
can
shine
but
other
than
that
its
pretty
good
o
i
like
a
good
hoppy
brown
ale
more
than
most
but
this
one
doesnt
do
it
for
me
and
the
flavor
really
doesnt
justify
the
abv
maybe
i
should
try
a
fresher
bottle
but
at
the
bomber
price
i
probably
wont
o
impressive
brown
ale
that
has
a
chocolatey
taste
i
like
the
dominant
sweetness
that
makes
this
feel
like
a
dessert
beer
this
is
one
angel
that
you
want
at
arms
reach
at
all
times
with
some
warming
and
with
some
effort
you
can
extract
the
nicer
qualities
of
the
malt
nutty
roasty
and
live
with
the
rest
but
its
still
pretty
onedimensional
and
not
all
that
impressive
sure
looks
good
though
solid
allaround
brew
my
first
double
brown
i
could
get
used
to
these
o
just
not
a
great
brown
in
my
opinion
too
much
burnt
woodfig
smell
and
taste
not
smooth
with
the
7
not
very
flavorful
or
full
a
bit
hoppy
and
alcohol
tasting
probably
my
last
brown
angel
o
tasty
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
overall
a
nice
beer
no
flaws
but
a
bit
too
neutral
over
all
for
my
tastes
o
i
hope
that
this
beer
isnt
supposed
to
taste
like
this
because
it
was
just
awful
medium
almost
full
body
with
a
restrained
effervescence
that
presents
mostly
on
the
front
half
of
the
tongue
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
just
a
touch
of
coating
on
the
tongue
and
palate
the
merest
hint
of
warming
at
the
back
of
the
throat
this
is
a
really
good
beer
id
like
to
try
others
from
this
brewer
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
for
the
double
brown
ale
label
i
was
defintely
expecting
more
than
this
its
not
bad
i
just
had
higher
expectations
and
really
wanted
a
sweeter
beer
and
i
usually
dont
want
sweet
the
only
reason
im
finishing
it
is
because
i
strained
my
neck
working
out
and
want
to
fall
asleep
quickly
anyway
i
would
recommend
this
to
few
but
to
some
overall
it
is
a
very
flavorfull
and
drinkable
brown
ale
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
but
it
lacks
some
of
the
subtleties
that
would
push
it
into
the
upper
echelon
of
the
style
mediumlow
carbonation
keeps
the
brown
angel
very
smooth
throughout
and
the
sweetness
makes
it
a
bit
syrupy
poured
from
a
22
to
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
brown
with
thick
tan
creamy
head
aroma
is
nutty
and
sweet
with
a
roasty
nutty
chocolate
flavor
not
generally
a
fan
of
brown
ales
this
is
very
creamy
smooth
and
an
easy
drink
taste
is
smoky
somewhat
burnt
nutty
malty
flavor
that
is
very
smooth
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
tried
to
date
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
well
made
beer
overall
i
personally
like
that
the
balance
is
biased
toward
the
malt
the
contribution
from
the
dark
malts
is
a
bit
strong
and
maybe
just
increasing
the
carbonation
would
change
that
impression
i
am
going
to
hold
out
by
saying
that
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
american
brown
ale
and
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
where
the
carbonation
would
be
a
bit
more
controlled
otherwise
i
would
recommend
that
you
give
this
one
a
shot
anyway
this
brew
pours
a
muddy
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
thick
rocky
head
that
quickly
drops
to
a
persistent
cap
lacing
is
good
the
aroma
is
a
bit
muted
and
pretty
generically
malty
and
roasty
the
taste
is
of
a
big
balanced
brown
ale
a
nice
slightly
nutty
maltiness
runs
the
show
but
is
followed
up
by
a
significant
hop
presence
this
too
gets
mellowed
out
by
a
pretty
strong
roastiness
which
rides
all
the
way
into
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
its
got
a
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
body
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
a
nice
brown
ale
with
a
significant
american
influence
from
the
hops
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
a
little
chewy
and
dry
on
the
palate
drinks
pretty
well
although
i
thought
the
nose
was
slightly
muted
still
a
decent
brown
ale
though
a
pretty
solid
beer
for
what
it
is
a
brown
ale
nothing
to
get
excited
about
or
write
home
about
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
brown
ale
this
is
for
sure
a
step
up
from
newcastle
overall
an
adequate
brown
ale
but
not
one
i
would
really
ever
go
for
again

it
meaning
its
not

its
just
right
overall
this
is
a
really
good
brown
that
tastes
more
like
a
stout
swear
i
tasted
coffee
in
this
one
overall
this
is
a
complex
and
heavy
beer
but
as
a
fan
of
belgian
quadruples
it
is
certainly
something
i
can
handle
not
for
beer
neophytes
of
course
i
applaud
the

foam
that
lasts

on
the

it
has
a
chocolate

aroma
with
a
good
dose
of
citrus

and
perfume
its
pretty
full
bodied
super
silky

smooth
the
finish
is
soft

delicate
it

the
mouth
feeling
almost
a
little
tingly
like
after
eating
a

it
has
a
nice
full
wellblended
wellbalanced
flavor
its
very
chocolatey
with
some
dark
roast
coffee
the
hops
provide
just
enough
bitterness
to
zip
the
taste
up
and
keep
me
coming
back
for
another
sip
it
tastes
a
little
wooden
but
not
resiny
theres
a
hint
of
lemon
peel
there
seems
to
be
a

wow
i
dont
know
if
ive
ever
had
a
brown
ale
like
this
before
this
is
straightup
delicious
i
cant
put
this
beer
down
and
when
its
empty
im
going
to
cry
o
overall
this
is
a
really
really
nice
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
not
a
typical
brown
ale
but
pushes
the
limits
of
style
guidelines
and
ended
up
really
nice
a
brown
ale
dialed
all
the
way
up
to
11
check
cant
rate
it
as
a
traditional
example
though
check
it
out
anyway
this
beer
pours
nutty
brown
with
about
a
half
inch
of
off
white
head
which
recedes
leaving
a
thin
layer
there
is
lots
of
very
nice

very
pretty
beer
the
aroma
is
nutty
and
mildly
roasty
pretty
nice
there
is
also
a
mild
floral
hop
aroma
there
is
a
bit
of
coco
and
roast
that
comes
through
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
very
nice
pleasant
roast
nutty
flavor
a

of

comes
along

it

very
nice

one
dimensional

very
little

complexity
at
first
as

theres
some
vague
coffee
and
burly
dense
malt
flavors
pinned
under
a
numbing
layer
of
bitter
pine
sap
specialty
malt
and
an
overload
of
bittering
hops
it
comes
across
as
coarse
and
heavy
handed
medium
to
full
bodied
ample
carbonation
a
bit
too
rough
to
want
another
nice
brown
ale
here
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
good
balance
worthy
ooverall
im
a
tad
disappointed
ive
been
dying
to
try
this
beer
and
didnt
really
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
its
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
it
wasnt
a
double
brown
ale
and
didnt
deliver
the
layer
upon
layer
of
malt
the
bottle
talks
about
way
too
hopped
out
for
me
but
i
guess
a
lot
of
people
like
that
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brown
ale
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
o
this
is
a
relatively
unique
brown
ale
with
some
nice
qualities
but
it
falls
short
of
great
in
my
opinion
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
thanks
to
michael
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
o
nice
flavors
well
balanced
alcohol
and
a
wonderful
head
make
this
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
try
it
does
feel
a
bit
watery
and
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
of
a
bigger
body
deep
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
wonderful
tan
head
on
top
very
nice
robust
look
to
it
almost
a
cedar
hue
to
it
the
aroma
was
a
big
suprise
rich
cocoa
and
hints
of
roasted
malts
touches
of
caramel
as
well
as
a
light
tobacco
touch
to
it
really
huge
brown
ale
here
smooth
mellow
carbonation
rich
creamy
profile
with
each
sip
having
to
be
savored
time
and
time
again
lots
of
rich
caramel
malts
wash
across
the
tongue
with
the
very
first
sip
and
so
it
begins
as
the
smooth
mellow
cocoa
notes
start
to
come
together
and
mixed
with
a
light
earthy
bitter
hoppiness
solid
beer
im
borderline
offended
by
the
controversy
of
late
its
a
sexy
brownskinned
woman
with
angel
wings
and
clown
shoes
how
is
that
offensive
this
is
just
beer
get
real
i
will
definitly
add
this
to
my
beer
repitroire
d
nicely
balanced
and
tasty
nice
use
of
malt
in
a
good
brown
ale
nothing
really
jumps
out
because
balance
is
the
key
here
o
this
beer
has
some
nice
northwest
coast
hops
up
front
with
a
good
brown
ale
in
there
and
some
nice
british
hop
character
in
the
finish
the
cpj
light
body
over
carbonated
not
great
on
flavor
there
are
better
american
browns
out
there

d
definitely
a
big
of
a
strange
brew
not
necessarily
bad
but
id
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
that
worty
taste
for
me
to
want
to
drink
that
i
usually
get
my
fill
of
that
however
from
sampling
homebrew
at
various
stages
in
the
process
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
my
second
try
from
this
brewery
and
i
havent
disliked
anything
they
do
i
love
brown
ales
and
this
one
just
goes
a
bit
bigger
than
most
would
definitely
purchase
again
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
for
the
style
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
easy
drinking
and
good
tasting
beer
the
hoppiness
mixed
better
than
i
expected
with
the
big
malty
brown
ale
flavors
pretty
solid
beer
overall
o
the
beer
came
across
like
a
screeching
bitter
bomb
with
little
roasted
malt
or
other
flavors
felt
unbalanced
and
over
hopped
i
cant
say
i
will
reach
for
another
overall
good
stab
at
and
american
brown
ale
would
maybe
seek
this
one
out
every
so
often
but
not
something
im
crazy
over
had
no
problem
finishing
the
bomber
myself
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
i
like
this
beer
and
would
recommend
trying
it
overall
this
beer
is
quite
fantastic
the
complex
flavors
and
smells
are
blended
together
wonderfully
and
i
will
definitely
be
keeping
this
beer
in
mind
this
summer
its
an
enjoyable
take
on
a
brown
the
hops
add
a
nice
edge
to
style
without
compromising
the
standard

for
a
22oz
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
o
my
first
clown
shoes
brew
and
im
pretty
impressed
i
will
be
telling
people
to
try
this
one
because
its
not
your
average
lackluster
brown
ale
that
you
will
typically
find
in
the
market
o
nothing
fantastic
here
but
definately
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
thus
far
i
bet
this
would
go
well
with
some
nice
grilled
ribs
and
creamy
coleslaw
or
just
a
nice
fat
bacon
cheeseburger
with
grilled
potatos
it
gets
much
better
as
it
warm
up
and
comes
alive
a
damn
fine
beer
prost
overall
im
going
to
score
the
overall
lower
than
any
of
the
component
scores
because
the
whole
seems
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
a
nice
hop
forward
brown
the
problem
is
that
its
not
really
hoppy
enough
or
maybe
just
not
hopped
in
the
right
way
to
be
an
india
brown
ale
and
too
hoppy
to
be
an
excellent
brown
ale

not
my
fav
brow
ale
mouthfeel
is
on

with
slightly
below

carbonation
a
smooth
watery
feel
and
a
bitter
grainy
finish
that
has
too
many
earthy
notes
to
make
this
tasty
it
was

not

was

looking
for

coffee
nutty
fairly

a

but
overall
a
decent
brew
mouthfeel
light
and
very
drinkable
overall
the
focus
on
the
malt
complexity
could
be
balanced
and
even
improved
upon
with
some
hop
or
other
flavor
additions
the

aroma
is
light
but
still
distracting
a
good
beer
when
all
is
said
and
done
but
not
one
id
go
back
to
pours
a
very
dark
brown
and
really
close
to
being

black
a
thin
beige
head

along
with
sheets

very

very
easy

a
good

hops
are
low

on

show
up
as

undercurrent
on

tastes
like
english
hopping
to
me
i
am
getting
ample
caramel
malts
on
the
palate
which
is
sweet
mellow
and
very
smooth
think
less
nutty
and
more
black

with
sweetened
condensed
milk
dark

raisins
and
vanilla
peek
out
from
time
to
time
any
citrus
from
the

hops
is
well
masked
i
am
getting
just
a
touch
of
burnt
toast
and
singed
grain
late
brown
spices
very
cool
little
of
the
more
aggressive
hopping
one
can
expect
from
american
browns
but
this
is
not
really
a
complaint
low
to
moderate
carbonation
and
the
body
has
some
heft
without
being
thick
or
sticky
the
finish
is
rather
dry
and
roasted
although
the
complex
malt
bill
lingers
through
to
the
end
and
i
do
think
thats
a
hint
of
gooseberry
right
there
theres
the
hops
quite
a
solid
brown
ale
that
offers
some
interesting
twists
and
turns
this
brewery
has
yet
to
let
me
down
perhaps
it
speaks
to
a
portion
of
my
roots
o
the
bottle
wasnt
at
100
but
most
of
what
one
would
need
to
know
came
through
allaround
standard
east
coast
american
brown
hits
all
the
right
spots
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
still
a
decent
beer
overall
o

pleasantly
surprised
with
this
wondered
if
it
would
be

than
i
prefer
well
balanced
and

notes

abv
however
the
bottle
says
5

this
i
would
purchase
again
taste
more
roasty
and
nutty
hint
of
citrusy
hops
follows
and
this
one
drinks
very
smooth
without
too
much
cloying
sweetness
as
can
be
the
case
with
some
brown
ales
smooth
and
easy
drinking
a
noncraft
beer
friend
accompanying
me
had
the
same
beer
and
he
also
enjoyed
it
no
problems
here
with
this
solid
and
faithful
nut
brown
ale
i
was
slightly
anxious
to
get
started
so
my
pour
was
nearly
inverted
which
does
not
work
well
when
dealing
with
a
bottle
once
things
slowed
down
a
great
pseudocascade
took
place
resulting
in
two
fingers
of
dense
lightbrown
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deepbrown
with
garnet
highlights
srm
27
34
and
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
of
chocolate
coffee
tobacco
and
caramel
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
was
not
as
sweet
as
i
had
girded
myself
for
based
on
the
nose
it
tasted
more
like
cocoa
than
outright
chocolate
and
the
tobacco
taste
helped
to
also
reduce
some
of
the
inherent
sweetness
of
the
style
finish
was
semisweet
and
left
me
with
an
unusual
dried
tobacco
flavor
in
my
mouth
not
bad
but
just
not
really
my
bag
the
flavor
is
an
improvement
because
the
flavor
is
dryer
than
the
smell
indicates
strong
crystal
and
caramel
malts
the
swallow
features
a
very
good
hop
presence
more
than
most
brown
ales
the
body
is
also
above
average
kickass
nut
brown
among
my
favorites
for
the
price
this
is
excellent
1
79
a
bottle
but
you
cant
help
but
see
that
this
needs
a
bit
more
umph
to
make
it
excel
the
bitterness
is
more
pronounced
than
in
most
examples
of
the
style
good
malt
character
metallic
aroma
was
slightly
offputting
in
true
americanized
fashion
the
drier
toastier
and
hoppier
influence
makes
the
style
beg
for
food
anything
from
barbecue
to
cheeseburgers
to
stews
its
simply
an
allpourpose
ale
this
brown
ale
is
unbalanced
and
cant
decide
if
it
wants
to
be
sweet
or
roasty
and
both
qualities
get
muddled
neither
complimenting
the
other
this
offering
is
one
that
can
easily
be
skipped
overall
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
very
drinkable
but
not
crazy
about
this
it
really
lacks
flavor
in
my
opinion
ive
had
a
few
other
nut
brown
ales
that
are
way
better
then
this
you
need
to
check
out
rogues
hazlenut
brown
nectar
same
style
but
drink
them
side
by
side
you
will
see
what
i
mean
o
my
first
bier
from
this
brewer
very
good
i
look
forward
to
having
more
very
taste
nut
brown
ale
you
have
to
try
it
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
fair
head
and
some
decent
lacing
pecans
chocolate
and
fresh
tea
bready
earthy
texture
bittered
with
some
dark
chocolate
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
the
flavors
became
bolder
when
this
beer
warmed
this
is
an
offering
that
should
be
enjoyed
at
or
near
room
temperature
excellent
easy
drinking
beer
overall
not
bad
typical
nut
brown
style
with
a
nice
hop
touch
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
but
nothing
spectacular
o
ok
beer
i
like
the
roasty
filling
quality
but
not
the
beer
altogether
this
is
a
nice
rich
full
flavored
brown
ale
that
is
easily
drinkable
it
has
all
of
the
right
notes
for
a
brown
ale
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
checking
especially
if
brown
ales
are
your
favorite
style
not
a
fan
overall
if
ease
of
drinking
is
a
category
its
a
5
nice
and
easy
smooth
very
nice
taste
is
not
especially
great
but
very
easy
to
drink
o
overall
good
nut
browns
are
are
not
usually
my
favorites
but
this
one
at
least
stood
out
a
little
overall
a
tasty
beer
that
is
very
sessionable
but
not
the
ultimate
example
you
can
get
in
the
brown
ale
category
a
tasty
brew
i
recommend
for
those
seeking
an
easy
drinking
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
and
a
good
smooth
finish
brown
in
color
with
red
highlights
and
a
thin
head
dark
but
mostly
clear
the
smell
is
muted
malt
bread
a
touch
of
hops
but
not
very
intense
some
roasted
sensations
the
flavor
however
is
great
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
some
toasty
notes
backed
by
a
mild
bitterness
full
and
enveloping
mouthfeel
great
drink
ability
i
actually
like
the
chocolate
nutty
flavor
of
this
brew
sweet
it
has
a
small
bite
of
a
hop
finish
yet
in
the
end
feels
lacking
overall
somewhat
its
nothing
complex
but
i
like
what
basics
are
in
here
dryness
in
my
mouth
after
sipping
this
of
beers
i
know
that
are
brown
it
made
me
wish
i
were
drinking
a
celebrator
instead
the
fact
something
in
the
ingredients
of
this
decent
brown
ale
even
reminded
me
of
a
great
doppelbock
tells
me
i
liked
this
beer
more
than
i
expected
to
poured
from
a
355ml
bottle
pours
a
nice
cola
brown
colour
there
are
light
aromas
of
chocolate
and
smoke
on
the
nose
not
very
bold
or
pronounced
there
are
flavours
of
chocolate
and
toffee
with
a
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
this
is
definitely
a
session
beer
something
that
goes
down
easy
and
wont
fatigue
the
palate
over
the
course
of
an
evening
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
a
good
brew
fits
the
style
rather
nicely
the
malts
were
the
definite
star
of
the
show
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
the
flavor
profile
was
really
good
not
bad
just
an
average
brown
ale
o
this
beer
is
quite
chocolaty
compared
to
other
nut
brown
ales
it
is
also
rather
easy
to
drink
this
was
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
a
nutty
toasty
aroma
and
appearance
with
a
malty
thick
taste
and
mouthfeel
the
appearance
was
deep
dark
brown
with
minimal
head
but
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
and
relaxing
i
will
definitely
purchase
this
beer
again
soon
it
was
one
of
the
best
ive
had
ever
and
i
am
looking
for
more
beer
crafted
by
the
shmaltz
brewing
co
drinks
smooth
and
clean
and
is
apleasure
to
drink
though
it
drinks
lean
and
thin
a
decent
beer
not
amazing
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
promise
but
could
hold
it
together
better
still
a
pretty
good
session
ale
that
i
wouldnt
necessarily
buy
again
but
wouldnt
turn
down
either
just
wasnt
really
digging
the
taste
i
dont
think
id
have
this
again
o
richly
flavored
brown
ale
with
nice
nutty
flavors
o
solid
beer
but
definitely
not
in
the
top
half
of
brown
ales
i
have
had
in
my
life
smooth
and
rich
for
the
style
with
ample
sweetness
and
a
sharp
tannic
hop
bite
at
the
end
a
well
thought
out
recipe
on
this
one
as
the
flow
is
terrific
with
the
yeast
malt
profile
and
notable
hop
presence
all
play
nicely
together
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
its
only
fitting
i
be
drinking
this
stuff
here
at
jons
if
only
he
were
here
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
very
dark
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
cola
very
light
nuts
and
a
vague
sense
of
toastedroasted
malts
things
sorta
resemble
old
coke
thats
been
left
out
by
a
basket
of
peanuts
something
like
that
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
walnut
light
dried
maple
syrup
mild
toffee
and
light
toasted
biscuit
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
watery
feel
overall
a
weak
little
brown
ale
one
that
just
doesnt
step
up
enough
for
me
a
very
dark
brown
ale
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
it
had
an
initial
aroma
of
sweet
malts
hops
fresh
baked
brown
bread
taste
was
lighter
than
i
expected
great
balance
between
the
malts
hops
and
carbonation
flavors
of
caramel
chocolate
coffee
and
toasty
malts
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
but
there
are
better
nut
browns
available
locally
for
me
o
a
great
brew
can
almost
pass
as
a
porter
not
only
is
it
full
of
nutty
goodness
cocoa
nibs
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
make
a
strong
appearance
smell
and
taste
are
one
in
the
same
if
it
wasnt
for
the
somewhat
watery
flavor
and
metal
after
taste
it
would
have
gotten
a
better
score

is
a

a

on

its

for
an

i
just

in

brown

not
bad
worth
a
go
overall
the
taste
is
fairly
nice
roasty
lightly
nutty
and
bitter
but
the
other
characteristics
mainly
the
mouthfeel
take
away
a
bit
overall
not
too
bad
but
nothing
spectacular
either
poured
this
american
brown
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
dark
brown
color
produced
an
average
tan
head
poor
retention
and
left
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
toasted
malt
and
some
mild
nuttiness
medium
in
body
the
foundation
of
this
ale
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
roasted
nuts
overall
this
is
an
average
brown
ale
better
then
most
not
as
good
as
some
decent
session
beer
its
worth
a
try
might
make
a
tasty
enough
brown
ale
the
inherent
nuttiness
showing
some
commendable
staying
power
the
flavour
does
not
let
up
to
the
not
so
bitter
end
not
a
smack
in
ones
keister
but
at
least
worthy
of
seeking
out
more
methinks
poured
a
3
beige
head
with
good
lifespan
the
body
in
masstone
is
really
quite
dark
a
burnt
umber
brown
held
to
the
light
it
reveals
a
clear
mahogany
probably
the
darkest
nut
brown
ale
ive
seen
it
smells
mildly
of
malt
cocoa
and
coffee
the
taste
is
very
mild
even
milder
than
the
smell
and
its
kind
of
like
and
ultralight
porter
medium
long
finish
a
nice
enough
brown
ale
o
a
decent
brown
ale
glad
i
tried
it
id
rather
have
more
malts
than
hops
on
the
finish
this
is
one
smooth
beer
it
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
not
much
head
and
no
lacing
the
smell
is
very
subtle
but
i
mainly
pick
up
nuts
mouthfeel
is
rather
average
the
taste
is
smooth
i
really
dont
get
a
lot
of
overly
sweet
notes
and
the
finish
is
a
little
bit
of
coffee
id
drink
this
again
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
outstanding
brown
ale
i
wish
it
was
just
a
little
bit
maltier
but
still
one
to
seek
out
if
you
enjoy
this
style
o
its
a
solid
tasty
brown
ale
no
real
wow
factor
anywhere
but
worth
a
try
as
usual
with
shmaltz
overall
a
little
too
sweet
and
sugary
for
my
tastes
but
then
again
most
browns
are
decent
but
forgettable
in
the
land
of
average
browns
overall
its
a
bit
dull
but
not
bad
its
light
obviously
designed
not
to
overwhelm
the
palate
it
succeeds
there
at
least
but
there
are
much
better
beers
that
do
the
same
thing
a
decent
brew
a
bit
more
roasted
than
some
other
brown
ales
ive
tasted
but
it
doesnt
disappoint
pours
out
a
very
deep
brown
for
the
style
at
least
with
a
finger
of
fluffy
head
the
aroma
is
malty
nutty
and
a
bit
watery
smelling
the
taste
is
much
better
providing
a
nice
rounded
roasty
maltiness
along
with
a
nice
nut
flavor
bitter
and
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
mediumbodied
and
the
drinkability
is
good
another
solid
brew
from
shmaltz
im
really
finding
that
a
lot
of
their
smaller
beers
are
really
overlooked
the
coney
island
line
has
some
real
stunners
in
it
as
well
as
long
as
you
can
find
them
fresh
pours
a
clear
but
super
dark
brown
with
a
12
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
and
some
nutty
aromas
not
too
much
going
on
in
the
smell
department
unfortunately
taste
is
of
toasted
and
almost
burnt
malt
toasted
nuts
and
slight
caramel
flavors
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
with
some
nice
toasty
and
roasty
flavors
another
solid
brew
from
a
novelty
brewery
that
appears
to
be
notsonovelty
after
all
dark
brown
beer
ruby
red
at
the
edges
when
held
up
to
light
some
lacing
on
the
way
down
but
not
that
much
head
after
my
pour
smell
is
pretty
faint
smells
like
malts
and
mollases
tastes
slightly
sweet
like
maple
syrup
nutty
no
hops
to
speak
of
a
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finish
and
slightly
chalky
residue
on
the
tongue
a
belowaverage
beer
not
hard
to
drink
but
not
exceptional
in
any
way
and
im
not
a
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
im
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
ive
always
liked
brown
ales
and
im
a
sucker
for
nut
brown
ales
molasses
and
dark
fruit
medium
bodied
with
rich
slightly
hazy
cola
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
overall
although
i
stated
i
am
not
much
of
a
fan
of
amber
or
brown
beers
this
is
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beers
flavor
balance
and
complexity
overall
a
very
solid
brew
i
think
it
is
a
bit
underrated
this
brown
ale
is
fantastic
its
a
very
malt
forward
beer
but
it
has
a
smooth
hop
aftertaste
anchor
steam
dark
much
more
bitter
than
the
beer
anchor
is
famous
for
darker
color
but
same
weight
and
mouthfeel
wow
quite
different
from
other
brown
ales
ive
had
and
very
enjoyable
single
hopping
with
citra
really
helps
to
set
this
beer
apart
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
large
tan
head
aroma
is
malt
forward
sweet
chocolate
and
some
citrus
fruit
which
prepped
me
for
big
things
on
the
palate
toasty
nutty
and
chocolate
tastes
are
there
typical
things
i
expect
from
this
style
but
enhanced
with
the
citrus
fruit
characteristics
of
those
hops
has
a
bit
of
a
zest
or
tang
and
some
slight
bitterness
is
noticeable
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
maintains
everything
one
wants
from
a
good
brown
but
that
fruit
character
helps
to
make
it
unique
among
its
peers
overall
a
pleasant
sipping
beer
for
an
autumn
evening
soft
and
flavorful
nothing
surprising
just
a
clean
pleasant
taste
above
average
creamy
soft
carbonation
medium
body
very
drinkable
overall
this
a
good
very
good
brown
ale
nice
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
brown
sugar
nicely
blended
with
some
pronounced
slightly
bitter
but
not
outofbalance
hoppy
bitterness
i
like
it
this
is
malt
perfection
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
brown
alerich
malty
balanced
with
hop
bitterness
that
cuts
down
on
the
sweetness
but
is
not
the
main
presence
dont
even
consider
newcastle
this
is
the
way
to
go
i
wont
even
pair
it
with
food
because
it
is
so
good
i
wouldnt
want
any
other
flavors
to
interfere
with
it
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
with
a
nice
sweet
roasted
flavor
quite
enjoyable
color
is
garnet
brown
clear

yeasty
with

enough
to
hold
up

pretty
juicy

overall
a

would

overall
im
not
a
huge

this
was
one

ive
had
it
paired
really
well
with
my
teriyaki
pork

sauteed
greensstuffed

medium

with

very

has
a

aftertaste
well
worth

i
am
very
disappointed
by
this
beer
as
i
am
a
big
fan
of
anchor
brewing
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
overall
not
particularly
memorable
but
pleasant
enough
very
drinkable
and
pretty
satisfying
but
not
quite
filling
not
sure
if
id
rush
to
buy
as
a
six
pack
but
is
a
welcome
componant
of
an
anchor
multi
pack
7
99
a
sixer
overall
a
very
good
brown
ale
an
aged
fruity
flavor
and
lighter
notes
of
toffee
and
chocolate
comes
with
a
dark
brown
color
and
a
very
small
tandirty
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
along
with
some
maltiness
there
is
also
some
chocolate
which
is
very
gentle
but
without
the
roasted
aroma
often
accompanying
it
taste
is
bitter
roasted
and
bitter
although
not
so
much
so
in
the
finish
the
bitter
aftertaste
stays
with
you
for
a
long
time
all
in
all
a
nice
brew
not
strong
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
standard
but
decent
brown
ale
worth
a
try
i
believe
this
is
only
available
at
one
store
in
my
town
of
around
3000
people
in
the
backwater
of
butte
montana
this
particular
fine
food
and
beverage
emporium
charged
about
10
dollars
for
a
six
pack
which
is
probably
too
much
considering
browns
of
similar
quality
can
be
had
for
about
25
percent
less
this
beer
is
simply
one
with
a
sparser
distribution
and
appeals
to
those
few
of
us
who
crave
variety
in
other
words
i
wish
we
had
more
variety
and
more
competition
though
it
is
getting
better
this
one
is
nuanced
but
not
too
ornate
for
a
brew
youd
have
regularly
almost
too
sweet
but
the
different
facets
make
up
for
this
solid
the
feel
is
very
easy
with
a
slight
watery
taste
love
to
see
a
more
full
robust
feel
as
i
think
it
would
lend
to
a
fuller
taste
o
very
drinkable
beer
but
seems
to
miss
the
mark
as
a
brown
ale
im
a
big
fan
and
this
is
the
first
ive
seen
this
beer
in
ne
florida
a
bit
of
a
letdown
and
not
my
favorite
from
anchor
a
brown
ale
made
with
citra
hops
why
yes
please
what
a
joyous
experiment
pours
dark
brown
with
ample
mocha
foam
much
like
a
porter
aroma
is
a
juxtaposition
of
strong
citrustropical
fruit
and
dark
malts
amazing
complexity
in
the
form
of
citrus
orange
blood
orange
lime
mango
passion
fruit
papaya
peach
and
brown
bread
almond
nougat
chocolate
coffee
and
brown
sugar
from
the
malts
some
body
and
residual
sweetness
coupled
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
from
the
hops
really
quite
an
aggressive
brown
ale
that
captures
the
malt
aspects
of
the
style
but
obviously
experimental
in
the
hopping
i
like
it
but
maybe
not
every
day
this
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
beige
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
the
taste
is
very
sweet
from
malts
and
burnt
sugars
also
in
the
mix
are
molasses
caramel
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
this
is
surprisingly
very
good
yet
a
complex
brown
ale
ok
though
nothing
special
to
be
fair
ive
never
been
particularly
enamoured
of
brown
ales
this
one
looks
nice
with
a
lovely
colour
when
held
to
the
light
however
the
aroma
and
flavour
while
malty
are
quite
bland
and
plagued
by
an
undesirable
harshness
body
is
par
for
the
course
it
meets
expectations
though
the
taste
could
be
cleaner
and
fresher
worth
trying
but
no
need
to
seek
it
out
overall
even
if
this
is
almost
two
years
old
this
is
still
a
good
beer
i
think
the
roasted
malt
flavors
would
be
more
rominent
in
a
fresher
beer
but
this
is
an
interesting
flavor
either
way
with
the
brown
ale
flavors
as
well
as
the
hops
bitterness
o
solid
nice
aroma
and
taste
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
o
i
kind
of
like
the
idea
of
this
beer
put
citra
hops
in
a
brown
ale
and
see
what
happens
the
problem
is
that
it
doesnt
quite
work
the
hops
fight
and
ultimately
overpower
the
malt
flavors
here
and
this
is
difficult
to
miss
as
this
beer
is
so
light
slick
and
heavily
carbonated
probably
one
of
the
most
turbulent
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
i
kind
of
think
this
one
should
be
treated
as
a
unique
experimental
brew
and
rated
as
such
in
the
end
i
do
not
find
brekles
brown
to
be
bad
at
all
but
i
do
not
find
it
to
be
all
that
appealing
either
i
kind
of
dont
know
precisely
how
i
feel
about
it
i
suppose
i
can
say
that
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
its
worth
trying
once
though
i
doubt
this
is
the
kind
of
brown
ale
fans
of
the
style
will
reach
for
on
a
regular
basis
o
a
pretty
nice
brown
ale
with
too
much
burnt
malt
character
for
this
to
get
a
higher
score
overall
a
pretty
complex
and
easy
drinking
brown
ale
o
a
nice
smooth
drinking
brown
ale
the
6
pack
i
bought
went
quickly
this
is
decent
quaff
from
one
of
the
west
coasts
pioneer
craft
brewers
and
one
of
americas
greatest
breweries
not
a
bad
beer
this
one
this
one
is
pretty
standard
fair
with
quite
a
lot
of
fruits
and
sweetness
with
a
nice
mix
of
malts
at
the
start
the
mouthfeel
and
the
soft
carbonation
of
this
one
made
it
a
clean
easy
one
to
drink
although
that
being
this
one
isnt
anything
special
well
if
brekle
likes
it
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
dark
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
caramel
nearing
burnt
light
roasted
malts
and
a
light
kiss
of
what
seems
like
orange
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
orange
more
present
and
powerful
doing
battle
with
the
eventoastier
caramel
leading
to
a
confused
clash
of
flavors
that
doesnt
sit
all
that
well
on
the
tongue
theres
a
sense
of
cedar
in
the
background
as
well
mucking
things
up
even
further
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slickish
feel
overall
the
hopping
of
this
brown
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
unfortunately
o
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
considering
the
style
but
man
i
loved
it
its
like
the
lovechild
from
a
doppelbock
impregnating
an
aba
o
a
very
drinkable
6
brown
ale
not
the
most
robust
one
out
there
but
still
tasty
and
different
dont
know
if
id
seek
it
out
will
probably
stick
with
anchor
steam
still
good
though
o
enjoyable
beer
goes
good
with
the
holidays
overall
this
is
a
little
more
hoppier
version
of
a
brown
not
a
bad
interpretation
of
the
style
and
would
do
again
if
available
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
browncopper
color
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
the
brew
smells
like
caramel
malt
nuts
apples
and
dark
fruit
it
tastes
like
caramel
malt
nuts
citrusy
hops
grapefruit
apples
dark
fruit
and
some
molasses
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
its
certainly
worth
a
try
and
i
know
id
buy
this
again
this
is
a
malt
centric
beer
there
is
mostly
malt
in
the
nose
and
taste
very
bready
it
reminds
me
of
when
my
dad
used
to
brew
beer
and
i
would
eat
the
malt
carmelly
sweetness
it
has
a
decent
finish
with
some
slight
bitterness
very
roasted
flavoring
pours
a
beautiful
brown
copper
color
though
o
definitely
a
treat
for
those
who
are
connoisseurs
of
brown
ales
such
as
myself
wish
id
taken
a
crack
at
another
ill
just
keep
an

that
light
chocolate
aroma
and
flavor
that
i
typically
associate
with
a
brown
ale
im
thinking
one
and
done
here
an
easy
drinking
and
approachable
take
on
the
style
very
bready
with
some
deep
sweetness
lost
a
little
as
it
warmed
and
just
never
really
let
up
with
the
malt
sweetness
sourcing
purchased
at
specs
in
texas
in
march
of
2013
for
7
99sixpack
notes
its
rather
unique
with
its
hop
forwardness
there
is
some
sweetness
from
the
malts
but
its
still
a
drinkable
beer
cheers
the
beer
poured
a
wonderful
dark
cordovan
with
a
tan
head
that
had
orangish
highlights
the
aroma
was
a
bit
medicinal
with
some
hints
of
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
rich
and
malty
with
hints
of
dark
fruits
the
feel
is
light
and
just
on
the
dry
side
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
a
good
malty
brew
quite
a
treat
with
all
the
hops
out
there
to
get
something
that
is
just
a
strait
beer
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
brekles
brown
and
will
definitely
be
working
it
into
my
regular
rotation
ive
been
digging
pretty
much
everything
ive
tried
from
anchor
recently
and
this
was
no
exception
i
think
its
about
time
to
book
me
a
brewery
tour
o
good
drinkability
refreshing
anchor
quality
not
the
best
brown
ale
ever
but
a
sturdy
serviceable
example
comes
out
of
the
bottle
thick
tried
agitating
it
to
get
some
head
but
none
formed
next
comes
a
strong
sickly
sweet
candy
smell
sure
enough
cloying
malty
sweetness
hits
me
hard
it
feels
as
syrupy
as
it
looked
coming
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
my
3rd
time
drinking
this
and
once
was
as
a
blind
test
at
my
home
brewers
meeting
all
three
times
wound
up
with
the
same
thoughts
about
cloying
syrup
i
am
sad
bc
i
generally
have
great
respect
for
anchors
beers
o
pretty
likable
i
must
say
id
reckon
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
move
up
to
two
and
it
would
become
pretty
cloying
still
a
solid
example
of
a
style
i
dont
really
care
for
overall
a
bold
and
flavourful
brown
ale
that
can
please
many
palates
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
enjoy
i
have
to
credit
anchor
for
having
the
coolest
labels
fortunately
the
beer
is
good
as
well
nice
chestnut
brown
color
mild
caramel
sweet
aroma
toasted
pecans
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
flavor
mild
hazel
nuts
and
pecans
brown
sugar
and
caramel
perhaps
a
tad
sweet
but
i
like
it
just
enough
hop
bite
from
the
citra
in
there
decent
mouthfeelbetween
the
lingering
nutty
sweetness
and
hop
bite
it
all
falls
into
place
have
not
had
a
regular
decent
brown
this
well
done
in
ages
anchor
keeps
it
simple
nice
o
not
the
idea
of
a
brown
i
had
in
mind
others
may
have
a
different
experience
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
rich
rubyhighlighted
brown
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
ring
of
white
head
on
the
surface
aromas
of
a
malt
bomb
with
a
dark
sweetness
leaning
towards
brown
sugar
and
hazelnut
with
a
some
dark
fruit
sweet
highlights
of
fig
and
date
flavors
are
rich
and
malty
on
a
light
crisp
body
the
effervescence
keeps
all
of
the
nutty
sweet
and
candy
flavors
from
being
overpowering
or
cloying
on
the
palate
very
tangy
sweet
aftertaste
with
a
woody
and
nutty
blend
that
is
carried
off
the
tongue
and
out
of
the
mouth
rapidly
by
the
smooth
thin
body
and
carbonation
clean
slick
finish
with
only
a
slightly
sweet
linger
very
solid
easy
drinking
brew
tasty
brew
that
is
on
the
bolder
and
tastier
end
of
the
style
a
little
sweet
but
has
a
bit
of
counteraction
from
the
hops
nice
creamy
body
with
kick
of
citrus
its
like
a
marriage
of
a
brown
ale
and
an
ipa
enjoyable
the
malt
and
yeast
character
are
classic
anchor
which
i
love
very
enjoyable
and
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beerthe
flavor
stands
out
from
other
browns
that
ive
hadits
a
candied
flavor
with
tons
of
sugar
and
dark
fruit
sweetnessthe
citrus
hops
snuck
up
on
me
after
a
couple
sips
then
lasted
the
longest
on
my
palettevery
unique
in
many
waysits
worth
trying
and
i
do
plan
on
buying
another
to
cellar
but
its
not
something
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
sittingmaybe
ill
get
one
now
and
try
it
in
a
year
or
two
to
see
what
happensthe
alcohol
is
high
and
im
sure
the
sugars
will
only
sweeten3

overall
a
good
brown
ale
a
little
roasted
that
reminds
me
of
a
porter
i
only
had
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
the
alcohol
was
spoton
and
didnt
detract
from
the
easygoing
nature
of
this
beer
while
it
wasnt
on
the
level
of
anchors
other
offerings
that
ive
had
this
was
a
decent
brown
ale
that
was
a
slightly
offbeat
take
on
a
style
that
tends
to
be
pretty
conservative
certainly
worth
a
go
for
anyone
hooked
on
anchors
hops
and
fullness
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
its
flavor
just
grates
on
my
palate
a
little
bit
i
like
the
creamy
fruity
sweet
aroma
and
those
components
of
the
flavor
but
theres
also
a
sharpness
that
detracts
a
little
bit
for
me
i
could
see
myself
having
this
again
in
a
pinch
but
its
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
a
surprisingly
odd
flavored
brown
ale
that
doesnt
conform
to
style
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
the
one
brew
from
anchor
that
i
have
not
really
enjoyed
flavors
just
dont
seem
to
go
together
at
all
a
bit
of
a
letdown
for
me
from
a
normally
solid
brewer
just
my
opinion
the
beer
pours
a
stately
brown
color
with
a
few
centimeters
of
creamy
foam
above
the
aroma
is
of
deeply
roasted
malt
caramel
and
a
component
of
dark
bread
this
browness
continues
on
the
palate
with
nutty
malt
and
a
slight
tinge
of
fruity
sweetness
coated
in
brown
sugar
an
earthy
bitterness
rises
toward
the
end
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
anchor
makes
good
quality
beers
and
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
a
decent
brown
ale
from
anchor
brewing
interesting
use
of
citra
hops
here
the
brekles
brown
from
anchor
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
at
least
in
my
opinion
the
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
brown
with
creamy
offwhite
head
that
is
leaving
a
lace
the
smell
is
bready
with
hints
of
malt
and
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
malt
that
gives
a
breadbiscuit
flare
which
is
quickly
balance
by
finishing
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
o
an
enjoyable
brew
these
smell
is
awesome
and
i
thought
i
was
going
to
love
it
but
the
citrus
and
acidic
after
taste
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
how
rich
the
smell
was
i
was
hoping
for
an
equally
rich
and
creamy
mouthfeel
to
no
aval
a
good
session
and
i
wouldnt
mind
sitting
at
a
pub
somewhere
and
drinking
a
couple
of
these
a
very
nicely
done
brown
ale
with
sufficient
hopping
to
place
it
solidly
in
the
american
brown
ale
category
chestnut

with
a

malt

and
the
finish
hints
at

sweetness
and
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
that
same
brown
sugar
sweetness
almost
onenoted
unfortunately
this
beer
is
malty
sweet
with
a
thin
bodythe
light
body
saves
it
from
being
overly
cloying
brewed
with
nelson
sauvin
hops
although
i
really
couldnt
tell
o
i
really
like
this
beer
the
hoppy
fruitiness
goes
very
well
with
the
malts
a
very
distinct
beer
and
a
nice
take
on
the
style
why
doesnt
anchor
get
more
love
recommended
for
anyone
looking
for
something
a
little
different
o
im
not
100
sure
i
got
a
fresh
brew
as
it
kinda
tastes
a
bit
skunked
but
going
on
this
beer
its
not
what
you
would
look
for
in
a
brown
ale
will
try
again
to
be
sure
in
the
future
o
a
good
brown
ale
but
im
not
sure
the
citra
hops
were
the
best
choice
for
this
style
unique
for
the
style
and
worth
a
try
on
tap
at
the
cannery
row

the

that
at

i
will
be
hitting
again
in

overall
4
0
i
like
the
simplicity
of
this
beer
no
adjuncts
and
one
hop
variety
used
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
ok
at
best
but
not
the
best
out
of
anchor
and
definitely
not
something
id
purchase
again
o
this
is
a
killer
brown
ale
the
use
of
only
citra
hops
and
allmalt
really
showcases
the
great
craftsmanship
and
experience
of
anchor
this
is
a
great
beer
for
any
time
of
the
year
and
worthy
of
a
regular
purchase
well
done
anchor
an
easy
beer
to
plow
through
even
if
you
dont
like
it
goes
down
smooth
a
far
cry
from
anchors
best
products
but
a
worthwhile
try
o
a
hop
heavy
brown
with
clashing
charachteristics
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
cohesion
the
combination
of
flavors
are
somewhat
confused
and
lack
harmony
which
is
the
hallmark
of
a
great
brew
i
love
that
this
brew
takes
a
chance
with
the
citra
hop
notes
but
overall
needs
a
bit
more
work
to
attain
greatness
not
really
what
i
would
consider
a
brown
ale
but
not
a
bad
beer
pours
a
reddish
amber
good
amount
of
head
that
lasted
several
minutes
considerable
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
somewhat
of
malty
sourdough
with
citrus
tones
initial
taste
was
fairly
bitter
for
a
brown
ale
very
hoppy
but
this
quickly
gave
way
to
a
malty
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
lingers
on
the
palate
looks
better
than
it
tastes
i
wanted
a
good
brown
ale
and
i
didnt
get
it
with
this
one
i
would
have
probably
liked
it
more
if
it
was
more
like
i
was
expecting
and
in
the
mood
for
o
totally
great
brown
id
buy
6
and
order
another
thanks
anchor
o
this
beer
is
both
special
and
limited
becuase
of
how
simple
it
is
if
you
like
a
malty
brown
ale
this
is
a
pretty
solid
choice
but
thats
really
all
it
has
to
offer
it
has
a
predominantly
smell
of
aromatic
hops
and
it
has
a
sweet
biscuit
taste
from
malt
with
dark
fruits
and
some
nuts
all
under
a
smoked
base
and
plenty
of
hops
another
interesting
brew
from
anchor
worth
it
a
try
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
and
a
solid
brew
from
anchor
overall
the
citra
hops
really
makes
anchors
brekle
stand
out
in
its
class
not
the
most
sophisticated
or
even
balanced
brown
ale
yet
it
still
is
remarkably
drinkable
and
not
too
heavy
on
the
palate
although
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
look
for
it
again
perhaps
one
day
when
i
feel
like
reminding
myself
of
this
ale
i
might
pick
another
one
up
overall
a
lighterbodied
brown
without
much
character
aside
from
the
great
use
of
citra
hops
but
still
a
fun
one
to
try
oa
poor
beer
i
am
disappointed
in
this
one
was
expecting
a
lot
better
from
anchor
this
is
an
incredibly
hoppy
brown
ale
the
hops
come
through
first
followed
by
a
typical
brown
ale
maltiness
its
sweet
and
citrusy
which
is
a
bit
odd
for
the
style
its
complex
and
highly
drinkable
and
ultimately
enjoyable
if
not
a
bit
strange
and
unique
its
worth
a
try
o
no
beer
have
i
tried
in
the
last
year
has
generated
more
back
and
forth
activity
than
this
one
for
me
but
due
to
its
low
drinkability
ill
just
say
drink
with
an
open
mind
o
not
a
fan
and
an
anchor
disappointment
high
c
pours
a
nice
cinnamon
brown
with
some
etched
surface
foam
that
is
oat
colored
smells
of
toasted
oats
some
malt
syrup
smacks
cereal
and
bit
of
cardboard
smells
sweet
flavor
is
toasted
and
sweet
oats
some
cola
some
bakin
soda
flavors
the
body
on
this
is
surprisingly
empty
with
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
im
not
impressed
ewith
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
really
really
good
brown
fairly
bold
good
balance
despite
the
citrus
hop
character
being
hidden
at
colder
temp
im
not
big
on
browns
but
id
definitely
buy
this
one
again
several
times
over
overall
this
just
once
again
proves
i
do
not
like
the
flavor
profile
of
dark
malt
and
hops
dark
beers
should
be
malty
light
ones
should
be
hoppy
there
is
nothing
that
can
change
my
taste
preference
on
that
so
take
this
for
what
its
worth
sweet
malt
nose
under
an
unimpressive
pour
albeit
nice
brown
color
taste
is
classically
roasty
nutty
sweets
malts
although
not
a
bit
tacky
or
cloying
but
balanced
with
plenty
of
citra
hop
zing
for
great
drinkability
i
like
it
as
an
ipa
drinker
who
dislikes
sticky
sweet
beers
great
for
a
brown
afficionado
on
a
summer
day
when
quaffability
is
desired
in
my
estimation
o
the
sweetness
feels
way
out
of
balance
even
with
an
aggressive
lemon
acidity
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
brown
ale
for
me
there
isnt
any
real
deviation
from
what
you
initially
get
it
stays
fairly
consistent
and
smooth
though
a
bit
heavy
on
the
malty
sweet
side
i
can
appreciate
this
one
a
well
done
brew
that
isnt
really
trying
to
be
too
much
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
smooth
almost
crisp
with
a
medium
body
mild
carbonation
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
decent
enough
beer
and
an
average
brown
ale
but
not
a
beer
id
be
in
a
rush
to
buy
again
feels
medium
bodied
and
well
balanced
feel
45
nothing
takes
over
as
thankfully
this
isnt
overhopped
which
tends
to
be
the
prevailing
characteristic
amongst
american
brown
ales
overall
45
the
rest
a
unique
brown
thats
well
worth
a
taste
the
aroma
and
initial
taste
was
very
atypical
but
then
the
finish
brings
it
back
to
a
more
typical
brown
ale
chipotle
anything
o
a
little
more
than
just
average
for
the
style
never
really
been
a
fan
of
anchor
steam
but
trying
the
nut
brown
ales
today
and
gave
it
a
shot
the
others
i
had
today
were
superior
to
this
one
but
it
doesnt
taste
too
bad
when
all
else
fails
i
always
go
back
to
anchor
just
simple
solid
and
delicious
carbonated
more
like
a
porter
its
fitting
though
o
rich
without
being
heavy
well
balanced
easy
drinking
this
is
an
easily
sessionable
brown
ale
o
this
is
a
solid
likeable
easy
to
drink
beer
one
the
better
brown
ales
this
is
what
a
brown
ale
should
be
not
hugely
complex
but
flavorful
and
somewhat
sessionable
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
at
6
abv
even
as
the
ale
warms
it
maintains
its
refreshing
character
considering
the
three
digit
temperatures
today
i
considered
drinking
a
wheat
beer
i
am
glad
i
chose
this
one
instead
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
meium
brown
with
amber
hue
a
thinner
but
well
formed
off
white
head
atop
aromas
were
fruity
with
bitter
chocolatemolassesearthyand
lightly
roasted
nuttinessalot
going
on
for
a
brown
ale
a
little
sharp
in
the
feel
if
it
smooths
out
its
really
top
notch
flavors
are
mildly
sweet
upfront
with
some
brown
sugar
and
fruity
tonesa
big
drying
earthiness
really
takes
over
into
a
nice
finish
i
really
like
the
flavor
profile
of
this
brownits
american
to
the
hilt
with
its
big
earthy
hopped
up
finish
tweak
the
body
and
this
is
really
top
notch
o
id
do
it
again
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
was
quite
good
the
malts
worked
well
with
the
citrus
hops
to
develop
a
balanced
flavor
its
not
something
i
will
frequent
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
this
is
probably
my
favorite
brown
ale
so
far
o
i
quite
like
this
beer
and
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
in
the
future
it
has
a
great
blend
of
rich
flavor
creamy
yet
easy
to
drink
body
in
any
environment
and
i
think
its
a
unique
take
on
the
brown
ale
style
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
chocolate
brown
with
a
tall
light
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
beer
smells
of
dark
roasted
barley
malt
caramel
and
chocolate
it
smells
like
a
traditional
brown
ale
the
beer
is
sweet
and
malty
there
are
flavors
of
chocolate
and
some
hops
to
balance
the
malty
sweetness
theres
a
mild
citrus
tang
as
well
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
adequate
carbonation
the
beer
is
creamy
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
the
beer
has
some
phenomenal
flavors
and
complexities
that
sing
the
praises
of
the
adopted
brown
ales
supreme
dryness
higher
bitterness
and
pronounced
citrus
flavors
seem
just
a
start
pours
a
cola
looking
brown
with
a
34
thumbs
width
mocha
head
a
sweat
earthy
aroma
of
brown
sugar
and
cherries
alongside
a
little
soapy
grass
flavor
is
very
interesting
for
a
brown
with
the
inclusion
of
the
cherries
alongside
brown
sugar
grass
and
closing
out
with
a
touch
of
roastiness
a
kinda
thin
active
mouthfeel
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
but
not
necessarily
the
most
memorable
or
best
brown
ale
id
happily
drink
this
again
but
definitely
glad
i
found
this
as
a
single
rather
than
having
had
to
buy
a
full
sixer
of
it
overall
a
very
citrusy
example
of
the
style
the
hops
sort
of
clash
with
the
bitterness
of
the
roast
malt
though
a
little
more
malt
complexity
in
the
flavor
would
improve
the
experience
the
taste
is
pretty
decent
with
some
light
tangy
fruit
from
the
yeast
adding
to
the
slight
tealike
elements
from
the
hops
which
have
some
spice
and
pine
notes
also
the
malt
is
very
good
at
keeping
a
solid
foundation
and
is
nice
with
some
caramel
and
toasted
tinges
with
subtle
alcohol
in
the
background
my
takeaway
on
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
anchor
one
of
the
nations
elder
statesmen
of
craft
brewersdefinitely
worth
having
again
brown
murky
mahogany
red
body
with
a
big
thicket
of
deep
tan
head
forming
thick
large
bubbles
flowing
up
from
the
depths
of
this
dark
brown
libation
i
smell
a
beautiful
expressive
hop
profile
with
more
citrus
and
earthiness
than
anything
else
complemented
by
candied
malts
with
mild
layers
of
roast
caramel
and
nuttiness
very
faint
tartness
arises
within
the
glass
as
well
this
is
a
balanced
single
hopped
single
malt
brown
ale
super
drinkable
effortless
really
pronounced
nutty
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
with
caramelized
maltiness
very
good
depth
in
the
malt
department
with
an
earthy
herbal
hop
note
that
lasts
in
cohesion
with
malts
throughout
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
velvet
silky
smooth
on
the
palate
graces
my
palate
with
ample
carbonation
even
flowing
slick
full
malt
profile
sticks
to
the
sides
of
palate
with
a
lingering
herbal
dry
finish
really
perfect
balance
with
little
to
no
alcohol
peaking
through
on
the
palate
overall
impressive
brown
quite
possibly
my
favorite
ive
tried
in
a
very
long
time
some
people
are
scared
of
this
style
since
its
hard
to
nail
but
anchor
did
just
that
out
of
the
park
fuckin
homerun
brown
ale
with
a
bite
good
beer
o
well
nothing
surprised
me
about
this
beer
i
liked
the
smell
and
the
flavor
profile
but
i
did
feel
that
the
cloying
cocoa
and
brown
sugar
combo
was
a
bit
too
much
for
me
i
think
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
crisper
as
well
overall
id
definitely
drink
it
again
but
i
prefer
other
brown
ales
like
moose
drool
for
example
lively
in
the
mouth
but
not
as
much
as
the
appearance
led
me
to
believe
solid
brown
ale
no
fuss
balanced
and
very
approachable
a
very
nice
englishamerican
hybrid
brown
ale
pours
a
thin
light
chocolate
brown
with
a
similarly
thin
off
white
head
comprised
of
large
bubbles
smells
almost
tart
from
the
yeast
but
tempered
by
some
sweeter
english
malts
and
some
fairly
aggressive
american
hopping
which
is
exactly
what
you
get
in
the
flavor
love
the
malt
complexity
in
here
its
sweet
and
bitter
and
roasty
at
the
same
time
hops
really
only
come
out
on
the
back
end
feel
is
pretty
good
a
little
thin
for
an
american
brown
but
its
a
very
very
sessionable
beer
and
well
made
like
all
anchor
brews
i
will
buy
this
again
overall
the
smell
is
disappointing
but
everything
else
is
fantastic
a
satisfying
beer
done
the
true
anchor
way
geez
almost
great
served
a
bit
cold
with
very
nice
large
tan
foamy
frothy
thick
creamy
head
that
slowly
settles
and
plenty
of
lace
color
is
a
pretty
clear
mahoganey
with
many
tiny
bubble
trails
aroma
is
banana
up
front
then
malt
roast
toffee
fruit
flavors
like
nose
and
is
fruity
up
front
too
then
theres
the
classic
brown
ale
flavors
oddly
sweetness
is
muted
at
first
and
comes
in
later
finishing
along
with
the
bitter
and
tang
body
and
carbonation
are
good
finish
is
like
flavor
ending
to
a
not
altogether
pleasant
bittersweet
slow
taper
taste
is
sweet
and
mild
with
a
slight
roastiness
and
a
tinge
of
citrus
hops
submerged
in
the
finish
a
solid
and
enjoyable
brown
ale
overall
a
solid
brown
ale
o
good
tasting
not
heavy
satisfying
my
wife
liked
it
too
this
is
a
pretty
nice
job
by
anchor
to
come
up
with
traditional
brown
ale
with
just
the
right
amount
of
flavor
and
touch
of
hops
yet
still
suitable
to
the
style
mildly
crisp
and
somewhat
smooth
the
feel
is
above
average
without
being
completely
compelling
the
body
is
medium
enough
to
support
everything
without
being
heavy
with
a
light
carbonation
rjt
o
im
pretty
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
looks
smells
and
feels
great
but
is
definitely
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
not
to
say
its
bad
by
any
stretch
but
compared
to
the
other
brews
im
not
overly
impressed
ill
do
this
again
with
my
second
bottle
soon
if
nothing
changes
ill
call
this
a
decent
beer
that
id
be
happy
to
drink
if
you
served
it
to
me
but
which
i
would
bypass
buying
myself
in
favor
of
more
interesting
options
d
i
enjoyed
this
brown
a
lot
well
made
brew
from
a
brewery
that
doesnt
have
an
overwhelming
portfolio
cool
brown
with
a
cool
story
worth
grabbing
if
you
can
find
it
pours
dark
translucent
burgundy
in
color
with
an
ample
caramelcolored
head
aroma
smells
of
fresh
grapefruit
and
caramel
quite
nice
the
flavor
matches
the
smell
but
i
fear
the
citra
hops
may
be
overbearing
the
caramel
malt
is
still
there
but
its
well
overshadowed
by
the
citric
flavors
id
normally
prefer
these
hops
to
most
if
they
werent
so
dominant
but
the
balance
just
isnt
there
im
also
tasting
a
slight
metallic
twinge
on
the
finish
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
brown
ale
maybe
worth
trying
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
but
not
a
brew
id
seek
out
for
pure
enjoyment
super
toasty
and
medium
roasty
bread
crust
full
on
malt
through
and
through
chalky
powdery
palate
dry
but
easy
to
drink
fairly
low
in
carbonation
but
very
quenching
some
nice
hopping
up
front
before
the
heavy
caramel
and
mocha
flavors
more
or
less
takeover
relatively
balanced
in
finish
and
overall
very
easy
to
put
down
a
slightly
sour
brown
ale
with
some
character

slightly
hazy
reddish

color
with
a

12

khaki
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a

that
lasts
some
slight
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
caramel
biscuit
molasses
toasted
malt
herbal

there
is

and

with
a
nice
and
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
no

noticed
at
all
very
smooth
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
fairly
nice
and
enjoyable
brown
ale
nice
malt
backbone
as
i
like
in
brown
ales
and
very
smooth
to
drink
o
im
amazed
how
much
i
like
this
beer
would
buy
again
lightmid
body
ample
carbonation
drinks
easy
maybe
just
a
tad
watery
would
get
again
a
decent
beer
the
mineral
character
was
a
bit
much
for
my
liking
overall
normally
this
goes
for
10
a
six
pack
purchased
this
on
sale
for
8
50
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
that
i
enjoyed
and
would
readily
purchase
it
again
for
8
50
but
10
is
a
bit
steep
to
make
this
a
reagular
purchase
the
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
has
a
mix
of
toffee
and
some
pine
from
the
hops
the
flavor
has
quite
a
bit
of
pine
and
resin
from
the
hops
as
well
as
some
light
bread
and
toffee
there
is
also
some
cream
in
the
flavor
but
what
really
stands
out
is
the
hop
character
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
good
not
must
have
a
little
pricey
at
9
for
a
sixer
have
i
ever
seen
a
sixer
of
this
before
i
think
today
might
be
the
first
time
at
trader
joes
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
middle
of
road
brown
ale
that
sure
was
unique
but
i
found
that
malts
seemed
to
clash
with
the
hops
this
beer
didnt
have
that
good
of
drinkability
i
drank
one
and
wouldnt
want
to
drink
another
too
sweet
and
the
flavor
doesnt
do
it
for
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
way
it
looked
the
color
and
head
were
on
point
if
this
beer
drank
as
good
as
it
looked
it
would
be
pretty
good
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
taste
i
didnt
care
for
them
that
much
and
i
thought
they
could
have
had
much
more
balance
to
them
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
since
i
didnt
enjoy
it
and
i
dont
recommend
it
there
are
tons
of
better
browns
on
the
market
for
the
same
price
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
it
for
sure
didnt
live
up
to
them
i
thought
that
the
malts
were
just
way
too
sweet
and
not
that
flavorful
and
the
hops
didnt
work
well
with
this
beer
i
am
going
steer
clear
of
this
beer
from
now
on
but
i
am
still
down
to
try
more
of
their
beers
but
this
one
didnt
to
it
for
me
better
luck
next
time

with

pungent

with

a

finish
aftertaste
is
mostly
about
the
malt
and
nuts
here
with
some
very
mild
earth
and
dryness
throughout
overall
a
nice
brown
but
a
little
boozy
when
warmer
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
i
think
my
beer
tastes
depends
on
my
mood
this
was
way
to
hoppy
for
a
brown
and
fiished
with
a
strong
after
taste
i
didnt
really
enjoy
drinking
it
finished
it
pretty
fast
to
get
to
the
next
beer
of
the
night
if
you
like
hops
go
for
it
overall
a
very
nice
take
on
a
brown
ale
more
hoppy
than
you
would
expect
from
a
brown
but
still
well
balanced
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
not
the
best
but
solid
nonetheless
overall
ba
d
citra
in
a
brown
ale
im
there
its
a
perfect
combination
supreme
drinkability
here
no
heat
tastes
great
the
price
is
very
right
please
check
this
out
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
brown
beer
i
would
probably
only
put
it
second
to
the
smuttynose
brown
dog
my
favorite
brown
a
more
than
solid
american
brown
the
citra
hops
are
a
great
contrast
to
the
silky
caramelly
nutty
malt
light
fruit
from
the
yeast
finishes
it
off
nicely
again
the
subtle
tropical
and
resiny
hop
notes
let
you
know
this
beer
is
allamerican
craft
beer
one
of
the
better
and
more
surprising
beers
ive
had
lately
and
its
nice
to
see
anchor
step
up
and
do
something
new
pours
perfect
brown
with
a
nice
oatmeal
colored
head
however
i
was
expecting
a
old
brown
ale
malty
taste
but
a
subtler
mild
malt
flavor
citra
hops
for
a
brown
ale
huh
maybe
not
my
first
choice
but
cheers
for
a
good
try
balance
is
good
though
but
oddly
theres
some
detectable
alcohol
as
well
lots
of
toffee
and
roasted
malt
a
big
robust
and
malty
for
such
a
smaller
beer
which
makes
sensesince
it
says
all
malt
single
hop
hops
manages
to
balance
the
beer
though
making
it
not
overly
sweet
caramel
tootsie
roll
like
after
taste
good
but
not
something
i
can
drink
more
than
one
of
unfortunately
a
malt
masterpiece
that
just
needs
something
more
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
at
all
and
decently
interesting
to
think
about
while
tasting
o
i
think
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
anchor
it
has
many
levels
and
is
nice
i
would
suggest
it
for
a
person
who
loves
hops
and
has
been
turned
off
by
the
maltyness
of
other
browns
o
cant
think
of
a
tastier
american
brown
right
off
the
bat
glad
i
purchased
this
one
as
a
typically
do
not
lean
towards
brown
ales
overall
starts
off
like
a
fun
twist
on
the
traditional
brown
ale
but
the
taste
just
isnt
there
a
disappointment
to
me
o
this
beer
has
excellent
drinkability
and
can
be
considered
sessionable
because
it
isnt
very
filling
the
palate
though
is
a
little
disappointing
quite
thin
theres
flavors
of
toasted
bread
caramel
and
a
little
toffee
but
theres
also
a
little
bit
of
a
grainy
cereallike
character
that
i
dont
care
for
this
does
ease
up
though
as
you
keep
drinking
it
while
the
hops
arent
noticeable
up
front
there
is
a
prominent
hoppy
bitterness
especially
on
the
finish
dry
grainy
bitterness
is
also
present
mildly
husky
and
astringent
there
is
however
some
citrus
mildly
juicy
to
ease
things
up
a
bit
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
decent
on
the
palate
ultimately
though
this
beer
isnt
terribly
enjoyable
what
is
it
with
this
brewer
and
me
things
start
off
so
well
in
each
instance
but
quickly
go
to
shit
the
offflavours
always
an
acute
surprise
here
we
have
a
nice
hoppy
brown
ale
which
turns
unpleasantly
into
a
phenolic
mess
all
too
soon
sigh

and
flavorful
with
interesting
and
wellbalanced
flavors
that
change
from
the
time
this
hits
the
tongue
until
the
lingering
aftertaste
slowly
fades
away
im
not
upset
i
have
a
6er
of
this
stuff
to
drink
well
concealed
booze
might
slow
down
the
process
but
im
not
very
scared
o
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
the
style
doesnt
lead
to
much
complexity
but
i
could
drink
multiple
bottles
of
this
and
not
get
bored
a
rubyish
brown
beer
very
clear
and
deep
the
head
was
thin
but
its
appearance
is
enticing
the
smell
is
a
nice
balance
of
roasted
malt
with
a
background
of
hops
orange
rind
and
flowers
the
taste
is
really
good
balance
with
a
smooth
malt
sweetness
roasted
malt
but
not
burnt
or
overly
done
firm
bitterness
in
the
finish
fruity
and
fresh
medium
in
body
and
very
smooth
this
is
a
drinkable
brown
ale
messy
and
all
over
the
place
not
a
fan
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
effervescence
smooth
for
a
brown
with
a
nice
malty
alcohol
aftertaste
slightly
warming
especially
at
the
top
of
the
throat
a
nice
brew
i
really
dig
anchor
beers
but
my
issue
with
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
its
just
too
thin
for
my
liking
i
expected
more
nevertheless
this
is
still
a
quaffable
brown
ale
this
seems
more
english
styled
to
me
that
or
i
have
an
old
bottle
not
a
bad
brown
ale
but
not
upper
crust
by
any
means
o
solid
malty
flavor
and
layers
of
complexity
with
a
boozy
sweetness
a
big
drinking
brown
o
i
think
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
there
isnt
anything
that
blows
me
away
but
still
a
nice
easy
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
brown
that
is
a
bit
different
than
many
out
there
however
it
was
really
nothing
to
write
home
about
if
i
am
looking
for
a
cheap
and
widely
available
brown
i
will
still
seek
out
some
sn
tumbler
or
some
local
offering
not
really
very
good
o
not
a
terrible
beer
it
has
some
nice
roasted
notes
but
it
has
an
over
powering
boozy
finish
that
hinders
its
drinkability
i
love
anchor
porter
and
steam
but
this
is
an
average
offering
3
5
d
strange
but
tasty
beer
that
has
a
damn
good
mouthfeel
o
this
beer
has
a
big
fizz
that
scrubs
away
a
lot
of
the
flavor
and
the
malt
is
already
a
bit
faint
with
some
odd
notes
to
it
the
hops
are
a
bit
overpowering
and
heavy
on
the
bitter
side
with
an
odd
citrus
note
to
them
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
of
balance
to
it
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
smooth
beer
and
lots
of
malt
flavor
wish
they
brewed
this
one
more
o
brekles
brown
is
a
decent
american
brown
ale
i
find
it
a
little
too
bitter
but
this
qould
easily
fit
the
needs
of
anybody
who
likes
browns
or
lightbodied
american
porters
as
well
could
be
a
bit
sweeter
and
a
little
less
bitter
in
my
opinion
o
a
very
malty
brown
ale
that
has
a
big
flavor
it
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
which
some
may
not
like
odnot
a
fan
of
this
beer
two
separate
parts
of
the
taste
the
odd
initial
flavor
and
the
metallic
flavor
are
unappealing
to
me
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
of
this
i
was
exceedingly
surprised
by
how
good
this
beer
is
its
unique
and
doesnt
taste
like
any
other
beer
i
can
recall
dark
and
brown
ales
are
rarely
my
favorites
but
this
is
one
really
really
good
beer
wow
overall
drinkability
an
interesting
brown
ale
strikes
me
as
a
beer
to
go
with
food
rather
than
drink
by
itself
as
i
enjoyed
it
more
when
i
was
drinking
it
with
my
meal
refried
bean
and
rice
burritos
but
that
is
not
to
say
i
didnt
enjoy
it
when
i
finished
it
off
after
the
meal
it
grew
on
me
quite
a
bit
by
the
end
of
the
glass
which
tells
me
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
as
i
wanted
another
one
when
the
glass
was
empty
does
have
a
bit
of
a
window
though
of
temperature
for
drinking
though
too
warm
and
the
roasted
malt
flavor
gets
a
bit
acrid
too
cold
and
its
too
bitter
so
just
right
and
indeed
its
just
right
i
think
a
good
addition
to
the
anchor
family
of
beers
o
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
picking
it
apart
the
flavor
is
unconventional
but
enjoyable
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
again
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
a
strange
sensation
that
beer
feels
warmer
than
it
is
once
in
your
mouth
hard
to
explain
this
and
ive
only
experienced
this
a
few
times
not
sure
what
causes
this
theres
a
slight
tingle
from
the
alcohol
but
no
heat
o
off
the
wall
according
to
style
use
to
english
hops
which
give
a
mild
characteristic
compared
to
an
intense
citrus
taste
more
accustom
to
pale
ales
i
love
the
change
up
and
definitely
an
eye
opener
to
anchor
steam
being
not
too
familiar
with
their
product
offering
a
decent
american
brown
ale
but
i
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
with
cascades
hops
instead
of
the
citra
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brownish
red
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
small
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
toffee
and
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
of
caramel
and
bright
citric
hops
it
has
a
less
depth
than
the
aroma
but
is
still
quite
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
a
few
days
ago
we
were
lucky
enough
to
bring
you
a
little
bit
of
anchor
brewing
companys
history
through
their
flagship
brew
anchor
steam
today
we
will
let
anchor
bring
out
some
more
of
their
history
with
an
eye
on
the
future

brekles
brown
ale
is
named
after
a
german
immigrant
gottlieb
brekle
who
opened
a
brewery
in
san
francisco
that
would
25
years
later
be
named
anchor
brewing
in
tribute
to
brekle
this
brew
features
a
classic
allmalt
single
hop
recipe
old
that
makes
use
of
a
new
hop
variety
citra
new
brekles
brown
pours
a
reddishbrown
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
good
deal
of
lacing
slightly
sweet
malt
rushes
into
the
nose
with
dark
fruit
caramel
brown
sugar
and
trace
hop
notes
lingering
sweet
malt
is
again
in
the
foreground
this
time
well
balanced
by
the
new
hop
hints
of
coffee
and
caramel
come
through
on
a
sweet
and
lasting
finish
the
brew
features
a
creamy
light
to
medium
body
with
good
deal
of
carbonation
nothing
too
fancy
here
just
an
honest
to
style
brown
ale
from
a
brewery
that
seems
to
be
able
to
brew
nothing
but
good
beers
o
this
one
disappointed
me
i
must
say
citra
hopping
did
not
show
up
in
the
end
and
there
is
a
surprising
amount
of
negative
alcohol
flavor
for
a
beer
listed
at
only
6
most
likely
a
repeat
buy
im
a
sucker
for
really
well
made
beer
where
the
ingredients
shine
and
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
i
can
honestly
say
this
is
the
single
best
beer
ive
every
had
from
anchor
brewing
its
smooth
yet
flavorful
refreshing
yet
satisfying
im
legitimately
impressed
this
is
a
brew
that
well
definitely
be
adding
to
our
selection
as
soon
as
our
distributors
make
it
available
to
us
if
youve
never
tried
the
brekles
brown
id
suggest
stopping
in
for
a
try
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
sometimes
feels
a
little
watery
but
its
clean
with
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
that
offsets
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
unique
taste
is
bitter
citrus
and
pine
up
front
followed
by
a
good
sting
of
carbonation
which
gives
way
to
a
slick
malt
backbone
it
finishes
dry
with
coffee
and
caramel
notes
a
very
good
and
interesting
ale
but
it
tastes
a
little
watery
in
spots
this
brew
pours
a
deep
brown
with
red
highlights
head
is
fairly
small
aroma
is
good
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
big
caramel
aroma
here
the
taste
is
very
good
this
is
quite
the
interesting
brown
ale
it
might
seem
like
its
going
to
be
a
cloying
sugar
bomb
when
it
first
hits
your
tongue
with
huge
amounts
of
caramel
and
sweet
malts
hitting
the
tongue
however
theres
a
fairly
substantial
amount
of
hoppiness
for
the
style
that
is
that
comes
in
the
finish
along
with
a
touch
of
roastiness
that
really
helps
to
balance
things
out
the
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
substantial
and
wellcarbed
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
yet
another
winner
from
anchor
i
find
anchor
are
really
one
of
the
most
underrated
breweries
they
really
dont
do
anything
extreme
but
ive
never
had
anything
less
than
a
great
beer
from
them

recommendation
check
it
out
if
youre
keeping
up
with
the
series
otherwise
feel
free
to
pass
on
it
taste
starts
with
a
faint
cinnamon
flavor
and
ends
with
a
hoppy
non
floral
bitterness
kind
of
what
to
expect
from
an
imperial
brown
i
like
the
creamy
smooth
mouth
feel
and
there
is
a
nice
toasty
malt
flavor
this
is
better
than
a
lot
of
brown
ales
but
if
you
dont
like
the
style
you
may
not
like
this
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
than
if
expect
and
there
is
a
fairly
high
level
of
carbonation
that
seems
to
accentuate
the
bitterness
overall
im
let
down
after
being
sucked
in
by
the
aroma
o
one
of
the
more
interesting
brown
ales
that
i
have
tried
recently
this
is
a
style
that
has
definitely
fallen
out
of
favor
and
innovation
by
brewers
in
recent
years
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
brown
with
nice
malty
smoky
flavors
but
surprisingly
not
strong
flavors
from
bells
somewhat
average
compared
to
a
few
others
the
abv
of

is
barely
noticeable
ok
but
will
not
seek
again
m
moderate
to
high
carb
for
style
o
overall
a
decent
beer
the
aroma
is
a
bit
on
the
funky
side
but
the
flavor
makes
up
for
it
overall
this
is
a
boozier
standard
brown
ale
probably
the
least
interesting
of
this

overall
this
is
a

american
strong

bold
yet
very
drinkable
brown
ale
i
find
it
to
be
the
best
of
the
series
so
far
flavor
follows
the
same
path
the
aroma
led
sweet
and
smooth
reminds
me
more
of
a
dopplebock
than
a
brown
ale
o
toss
up
between
whether
jupiter
or
mars
is
the
best

beer
so
far
jupiter
is
very
smooth

unassuming
bringing
a

brew
cheers

is
immediately
sweet
with
tons
of
toffee
and
caramelized
malt
there
is
a
richness
to
this
brew
that
carries
the
sweetness
to
a
complex
balance
this
is
unmistakably
on
the
sweeter
end
of
brown
ales
but
is
very
nice
wonderfully
drinkable
and
maybe
my
favorite
of
the
series
so
far
serving
type
bottle
o
i
am
not
a
huge
brown
beer
guy
but
this
one
is
awesome
i
will
buy
it
again
bells
does
it
again
overall
nothing
extraordinary
but
a
decent
brown
ale
nose
lacks
presents
but
the
flavor
makes
up
for
it
flavor
is
mildly
sweet
biscuity
nutty
and
woody
mouth
feel
is
perfect
it
sure
drinks
easy
for
the
8
but
the
flavors
are
light
and
a
tad
boring
it
could
really
use
some
extra
malt
presence
o
its
a
really
drinkable
brown
ale
straight
forward
if
not
amped
up
more
a
bold
sipper
than
a
session
ale
a
nice
nightcap
beer
id
definitely
pay
for
this
beer
again

served
in
a
nonic
pint

the
beer
pours
a
hazy
chestnut
brown
color
with
about
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
that
stayed
around
a
long
time
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
chocolate
toffee
roasted
malt
and
some
light
floral
hops
i
think
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
dark
breadiness
and
herbal
bitterness
noticeable
too
theres
more
bitterness
than
i
expected
but
thats
not
a
complaint
mouthfeelbody

a

underrated
in
my
opinion
venus
and
mercury
were
terrible
this
is
a
nice
come
back
for
the
series
it
is
decent
the
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
is
good
there
is
just
nothing
about
this
beer
that
gets
me
excited
ok
i
think
ill
give
this
series
another
try
not
what
i
quite
expected
overall
i
am
reminded
why
i
am
generally
leery
of
brown
ales
with
the
significant
variations
in
hop
prevalence
that
range
from
sweet
dessert
beer
to
dark
ipa
while
i
was
able
to
finish
this
bottle
i
will
assuredly
not
repeat
this
one
much
like
the
carsons
brewing
brown
cow
the
description
of
which
spoke
volumes
about
its
seven
types
of
malt
while
including
a
throwaway
line
regarding
supporting
hops
this
is
hopforward
enough
to
not
be
for
me
it
just
doesnt
do
so
to
the
point
of
drain
pouring
flavor
is
on
the
sweet
side
accented
by
high
alcohol
esters
and
muted
malt
fruitiness
the
toasted
character
is
to
the
point
of
being
overdone
and
when
combined
with
the
earthy
hop
character
it
robs
the
palate
of
flavor
at
the
harsh
finish
overall
this
isnt
too
interesting
but
it
is
what
it
is
this
is
your
traditional
brown
ale
just
amped
up
for
as
hard
as
it
is
to
get
its
kind
of
a
let
down
if
anything
id
say
its
a
slightly
below
average
brown
ale
not

and
very
smooth
to
drink
for
the
abv
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
o
confused
identity
is
what
this
beer
is
all
about
when
i
first
started
on
it
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
brown
ale
then
once
it
climbed
a
few
degrees
in
temperature
it
tasted
pretty
much
a
winter
warmer
kinda
beer
lots
of
spice
this
group
of
planet
beers
has
not
been
one
of
my
must
have
i
keep
looking
for
one
to
be
great
but
has
of
this
date
no
luck
nicely
done
imperial
brown
ale
as
others
have
said
this
tastes
like
an
ampd
up
best
brown
not
sure
what
this
planet
series
is
going
for
anymore
definitely
ought
to
be
more
liked
than
both
mercury
and
certainly
venus
mars
is
still
the
best
in
the
series
in
my
opinion
but
jupiter
is
a
good
brown
ale
im
disappointed
that
i
had
to
drive
around
as
much
as
i
did
to
make
sure
i
got
a
bottle
actually
wound
up
with
two
but
i
told
myself
id
make
sure
i
got
to
try
every
beer
from
the
series
o
pretty
average
as
far
as
brown
ales
go
good
bitterness
decent
malt
backbone
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
despite
the
higher
abv
i
would
go
with
bells
best
brown
over
this
10
times
out
of
10
its
ok
but
not
too
impressed
maybe
because
i
consider
bells
best
brown
par
for
the
course
mediumfull
on
the
palate
the
beer
works
hard
to
retain
its
creamy
taste
and
texture
but
the
abundance
of
alcohol
and
woodsy
hop
bite
give
a
sprucey
finish
aftertaste
of
pepper
wood
and
coffee
grounds
remain
and
gives
the
ale
a
surprising
drinkability
not
sure
why
this
isnt
getting
rated
well
an
exceptional
brown
ale
this
beer
had
a
lot
of
potential
but
i
think
it
was
all
ruined
by
the
metallic
aspects
which
tainted
the
whole
beer
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
actually
think
this
would
be
pretty
good
in
bourbon
barrels
kinda
just
tastes
like
a
sweeter
version
of
best
brown
i
enjoy
the
light
chocolate
on
the
finish
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
fingernail
of
beige
head
brussels
lacing
aroma
is
of
hazelnuts
and
amber
malt
the
flavor
is
strongly
comprised
of
hazelnuts
and
amber
malt
there
might
be
some
piney
hops
but
they
are
overwhelmed
by
the
hazelnut
and
amber
malt
intensity
the
mouth
is
very
dry
and
crisp
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
its
too
malt
forward
more
like
an
east
coast
ipa
the
nose
is
nice
and
has
a
nice
nutty
finish
heres
to
21
years
of
delicious
beers
and
to
21
more
this
beer
ironically
was
a
21st
birthday
gift
brown
ales
have
never
been
a
favorite
smell
of
coco
choclate
coffee
and
rich
dark
fruits
decent
mouthfeel
the
hops
are
subtle
but
do
complement
the
malts
overall
fair
beer
no
real
standout
flavors
and
seemed
a
little
bland
mostly
nut
burnt
caramel
and
a
faint
coffee
and
even
a
little
tobacco
good
hop
malt
balance
but
overall
pretty
flat
needed
one
of
the
flavors
to
stanc
out
more
this
one
defies
categorization

a
very
nice
imperial
brown
ale
it
seems
american
craft
brewers
have
all
but
solidified
the
massive
brown
ale
and
made
it
their
own
yet
keeping
in
tact
the
roots
of
what
a
brown
ale
is
all
about
this
is
a

offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
just

a
very
good
brown
ale
o
a
very
good
brown
ale
all
the
flavors
are
there
from
the
earthy
roasted
malts
to
the
nuttiness
however
there
are
some
well
masked
subtleties
to
it
like
the
bit
of
chocolate
and
black
coffee
on
the
back
end
exceptional
beer
to
look
at
with
some
good
flavor
some
people
would
love
this
i
am
not
a
coffee
drinker
im
getting
a
nasty
bitter
black
coffee
bite
that
i
dont
care
for
there
are
a
lot
of
interesting
different
flavors
here
but
its
not
my
cup
of
coffee
this
is
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
12
oz
bottle
nose
of
caramel
and
yeast
taste
of
mild
chocolate
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
a
little
nutty
finish
the
hops
provide
a
lowkey
bitterness
to
nicely
offset
the
sugary
sweetness
smooth
with
good
carbonation
and
balance
not
earth
shattering
but
tasty
and
drinkable
an
exemplary
brown
ale
smooth
finish
but
not
lacking
in
flavor
pours
clear
brown
coffee
and
something
bright
maybe
lemon
on
the
nose
chicory
nutty
malts
and
an
earthy
finish
this
is
a
goto
brown
o
ellies
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
meow
beer
o
overall
a
delicious
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
brew
if
there
were
a
bit
better
head
retention
it
would
have
scored
even
higher
nevertheless
ellie
would
be
proud
indeed
very
good
balanced
beer
one
downside
is
the
head
retention
the
tan
head
disappears
quickly
the
ale
makes
up
for
it
with
a
taste
that
lingers
long
after
the
mouth
feel
disappears
bringing
once
forward
nut
flavors
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
semi
spicy
hops
with
nice
dark
floral
tones
that
really
compliment
the
medium
malt
tastes
could
have
a
fuller
body
for
a
brown
ale
but
seems
like
the
mouth
feel
of
many
american
brown
ales
traditional
english
browns
are
deeper
on
the
malt
but
this
one
still
carries
through
a
lot
of
the
flavors
you
come
to
expect
from
an
old
school
brown
but
with
stronger
emphasis
on
the
raisen
tones
throughout
both
in
the
aroma
and
taste
avery
has
generally
been
a
disappointment
for
me
so
this
was
nice
surprise
nice
malty
flavor
that
had
me
licking
my
lips
between
drinks
this
is
a
good
thing
for
me
sweet
on
the
finish
that
almost
seemed
like
candy
low
on
the
bitter
which
is
also
good
for
me
lacks
a
lot
of
complexity
or
character
overall
i
felt
is
was
outstanding
beer
that
was
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
hopefully
one
i
will
have
again
not
the
best
brown
but
very
nice
i
love
this
beer
the
six

i
got
recently

little

though
bright
malty

poured

i
could
stand
to
drink
a
few
more
if
only
the
flavor
matched
the
strength
of
its

lot
going
on
but
if
you
like
sweet
chocolate
and
creamvanilla
a
very
good
and
drinkable
brown
ale
worth
checking
out
for
sure
yay
dogs
yay
beer
not
unlike
english
brown
ale
but
somehow
more
subtle
while
still
having
more
flavor
an
awesome
beer
will
be
buying
again
and
thank
you
again
avery
this
brown
ale
appears
to
have
roots
in
within
a
traditional
maltforward
type
of
ale
the
malt
sugars
are
the
key
rich
slightly
charred
in
flavor
and
aftertaste
and
with
the
hops
providing
a
lowkey
bitterness
to
nicely
complement
the
sugary
sweetness
robust
and
delicious
o
good
brown
ale
i
would
only
change
the
hops
in
this
they
have
a
more
of
a
part
in
this
beer
than
is
really
needed
and
kinda
outshine
some
of
the
more
savory
if
you
will
aspects
of
a
brown
ale
still
a
solid
one
though
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
has
a
bit
brighter
malt
flavor
than
the
typical
brown
ale
the
hops
are
not
overpowering
more
like
an
english
brown
the
hops
seem
to
be
of
a
domestic
variety
which
adds
to
its
complexity
and
uniqueness
ill
have
another
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
quarter
inch
thick
khaki
colored
head
light
brussels
lacing
aroma
of
dark
maltcarameland
toffee
are
very
enticing
i
get
coffeedark
malt
and
chocolate
in
the
flavor
this
is
smooth
and
creamy
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
theres
a
light
smoked
malt
note
in
the
aftertaste
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
and
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
in
here
this
is
definitely
on
the
sweeter
end
of
the
spectrum
overall
not
my
favorite
avery
brew
nor
brown
ale
but
a
decent
option
overall
excellent
offering
in
the
style
just
an
absolutely
forgotten
gem
in
the
style
overall
very
nice
and
gently
nuanced
with
flavors
that
meld
together
well
easy

drink

this

everything
i
like
in

would
have
again

getting
some

too
but
its
very
faint
i
purchased
just
one
can
next
time
ill
get
a
sixer
of
this
really
enjoyable
o
solid
american
brown
ale
not
cloying
very
pleasant
on
a
chilly
evening
i
much
prefer
upslope
brown
to
ellies
probably
wont
have
again
o
about
as
solid
as
they
come
for
brown
ales
o
rating
this
was
difficult
because
it
was
excellent
but
not
my
idea
of
either
a
malty
english
or
hoppy
american
brown
this
ought
to
be
labelled
ellies
porter
or
even
ellies
stout
have
a
bottle
of
their
new
world
stout
which
i
am
now
anxious
to
compare
to
this
oi
have
used
this
beer
for
years
in
my
bbq
sauce
i
put
it
on
my
ribs
and
other
pork
because
it
has
the
flavors
and
taste
i
seek
for
that
purpose
to
drink
this
beer
on
a
cold
winter
day
would
be
nice
but
it
goes
well
with
bbq
also
o
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
but
its
up
there
only
df
head
iba
surpasses
this
to
date
in
my
book
o
nice
straight
forward
example
of
the
style
though
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
very
easily
drinkable
you
could
probably
session
this
beer
with
no
problem
deep
dark
ruby
reds
and
chocolate
browns
with
an
off
white
persistent
creamy
head
nose
is
very
light
baking
chocolate
and
cooked
sugar
easy
drinking
with
sweet
cocoa
and
light
morning
coffee
up
front
delicate
hop
finish
coasts
with
a
lightly
caramel
flavor
in
the
finish
thin
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
seems
very
mild
suprisingly
nuanced
and
balanced
not
at
all
assertive
or
bold
a
very
easy
drinking
session
brown
that
just
replaced
moose
drool
as
my
new
favorite
aba
also
superior
to
rogue
hazelnut
brown
nectar
the
best
american
brown
that
im
aware
of
this
is
a
killer
brown
ale
not
like
any
other
drinks
like
a
brown
should
very
drinkable
and
palatable
highly
recommended
should
be
considered
a
must
try
overall
its
a
brown
ale
and
if
you
like
brown
ales
youll
probably
like
it
im
just
not
so
crazy
about
it
o
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
nothing
revolutionary
or
mind
blowing
here
its
a
brown
ale
after
all
but
a
really
well
crafted
beer
all
around
and
a
great
everyday
kind
of
beer
outstanding
o
this
is
a
tasty
brown
ale
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
the
malty
flavors
are
great
overall
good
to
very
good
i
do
prefer
a
stronger
brown
ale
but
for
the
style
i
think
this
has
been
very
well
done
leave
it
to
avery
to
brew
such
a
fine
dark
ale
not
my
everyday
brew
but
i
probably
will
add
a
six
pack
in
to
my
rotation
of
beer
purchases
from
time
to
time
if
you
love
traditional
british
brown
ales
you
must
try
this
excellent
brew
it
is
tops
someday
i
will
visit
the
brewery
a
plainly
drinkable
and
little
more
brown
ale
the
expected
yankee
hops
and
oldworld
biscuity
character
both
conspicuously
absent
theres
enough
going
on
to
recommend
this
however
but
it
comes
off
as
a
bit
weak
when
put
up
against
this
brewers
more
heady
offerings
overall
i
really
really
like
this
brown
ale
i
love
the
roastiness
and
the
maltiness
of
this
beer
as
well
as
the
slight
creaminess
ellies
brown
ale
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
that
ive
had
and
ill
certainly
be
getting
more
of
it
o
very
tasty
brown
ale
lots
of
flavor
which
is
what
a
lot
of
browns
lack
o
slightly
lacking
on
flavor
but
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
that
has
some
good
qualities
i
bet
an
imperial
version
of
this
beer
would
be
killer
poured
a
deep
clear
brown
with
creamy
tan
head
the
head
has
great
retention
and
leaves
sticky
lacing
here
and
there
the
aroma
is
mild
mostly
darker
roasted
malt
and
a
little
earthy
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
more
robust
with
nice
nutty
flavors
and
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
background
there
is
also
a
little
earthiness
to
the
whole
affair
it
has
a
nice
weight
to
the
body
and
a
smooth
silky
feeling
a
solid
brown
ale
a
pretty
good
brown
o
eh
just
another
brown
ale
in
fairness
this
really
isnt
my
style
basically
it
does
everything
decently
without
doing
anything
impressively
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
id
say
ellies
is
the
best
brown
ive
had
and
id
also
say
that
those
who
like
the
traditional
brown
ale
style
will
really
dig
this
one
cheers
overall
great
craft
can
for
sure
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
but
this
one
is
tasty
odi
wanted
more
from
this
but
i
did
enjoy
my
pint
i
thought
it
had
more
potential
in
it
though
pours
a
deep
dark
reddishbrown
that
is
close
to
black
very
small
tan
head
but
left
good
lacing
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
of
nutty
grains
and
chocolate
very
pleasing
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
the
same
and
very
pleasant
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
perfect
carbonation
really
liked
this
brew
and
the
first
i
had
from
this
brewery
super
smooth
and
a
treat
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
a
truly
under
appreciated
style
and
beer
this
one
nails
it
overall
good
price
point
available
in
a
can
or
bottle
good
balance
between
sweet
and
dry
roasted
malts
o
i
do
like
the
avery
brown
but
i
personally
feel
its
a
touch
under
done
and
the
brewer
is
leaning
more
toward
a
session
brown
instead
of
fulfilling
its
class
with
more
of
the
great
flavors
it
has
overall
avery
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
ellies
brown
has
some
incredible
traits
that
the
feel
doesnt
live
up
to
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
these
but
really
this
could
be
the
best
brown
ale
in
the
world
given
a
few
upgrades
tasty
beer
well
balanced
between
drinkability
and
complexity
as
would
be
expected
from
avery
this
is
a
well
made
and
well
balanced
brew
i
would
say
it
is
much
less
harsh
than
many
american
style
brews
overall
i
like
it
it
may
haves
some
weaknesses
but
it
is
what
it
is
a
good
brown
ale
yes
i
taste
the
vanilla
but
so
yes
t
looks
great
in
the
the
glass
someone
said
they
could
drink
drink
this
every
night
well
i
canr
this
beer
brings
nothing
to
me
yeah
i
know
it
me
but
i
cant
like
somethig
just
because
you
do
enjoy
this
beer
i
wish
i
could
overall
a
very
nice
brown
ale
poured
this
american
brown
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
dark
brown
color
produced
a
huge
tan
head
lacing
and
retention
was
excellent
the
aroma
consisted
of
toasted
malt
and
carmel
medium
bodied
there
was
a
foundation
of
roasted
malted
grain
sweet
caramel
and
nuts
semi
dry
finish
overall
this
is
an
awesome
american
brown
ale
it
may
be
my
new
standard
bearer
awesome
aroma
and
flavor
profile
overall
decent
sessionable
brown
ale
theres
enough
flavor
going
on
that
i
would
give
it
a
recommendation
but
its
not
something
thats
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
deep
dark
brown
mud
with
coffee
with
cream
head
cookie
aroma
with
chocolate
chips
earth
and
brown
sugar
tastes
of
cookie
chocolate
chips
brown
sugar
earth
some
vague
herbal
notes
and
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
where
theres
trouble
a
bit
light
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
a
nice
brown
ale
o
my
husband
really
likes
this
beer
he
refers
to
it
as
his
easy
everyday
drinking
beer
i
however
think
its
just
ok
it
is
an
easy
drinker
but
it
is
slighty
disappointing
i
would
like
to
see
more
depth
to
the
beer
overall
i
would
drink
it
again
but
its
just
ok
good
toasted
malt
character
a
touch
of
hops
but
definitely
malt
focused
as
it
should
be
no
off
flavors
o
very
solid
beer
that
has
some
complexity
while
maintaining
that
easyy
to
drink
feel
o
very
nice
good
balance
between
sweet
light
roasted
malts
and
some
nice
nutty
complexities
as
well
o
tasty
brew
that
i
could
drink
for
hours
didnt
blow
me
away
with
flavors
or
complexity
but
still
a
solid
beer
brown
with
fleeting
loose
light
tan
foam
and
evident
carb
with
large
bubbles
smells
of
coffee
cocoa
some
soil
and
leather
some
bits
of
tea
and
metal
flavor
is
biscuity
chocolate
coffee
nuts
roasty
malts
much
better
flavor
than
the
nose
which
is
bland
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carb
and
a
wet
finish
with
long
aftertaste
much
nicer
than
i
had
expected
o
impressive
flavorful
robust
malt
profile
delicately
balanced
by
light
hops
great
drinkability
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
nice
head
developed
tan
in
color
lasted
with
good
lacing
appearance
was
dark
caramel
brown
with
an
aroma
of
malty
sweetness
taste
was
nutty
and
malty
with
a
slight
caramel
chocolate
finish
mouthfeel
was
full
and
creamy
with
a
dry
slightly
caramel
aftertaste
a
really
great
brown
ale
overall
a
very
clean
finish
to
a
tasty
and
nutty
brown
i
really
liked
this
one
it
left
a
great
aftertaste
wasnt
bitter
but
had
some
great
qualities
such
as
the
earthy
roasted
nuttiness
i
could
do
several
of
these
in
succession
i
prefer
averys
ipa
othere
is
nothing
special
about
this
brew
but
it
is
a
solid
drinkable
example
of
the
style
the
chocolate
smell
and
flavor
are
a
little
simple
as
is
the
mouthfeel
but
on
a
relaxing
fall
evening
that
calls
for
a
few
beers
you
could
do
far
worse
than
putting
down
a
few
of
these
o
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
easy
to
drink
im
getting
this
again
o
while
it
might
not
do
anything
amazing
it
is
still
quite
a
well
brewed
example
of
a
brown
ale
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
in
a
bottle
and
a
can
as
far
as
i
can
remember
and
know
its
good
the
beer
is
a
moderate
brown
good
hue
but
not
too
dark
quarter
inch
head
a
lot
of
lacing
particularly
from
a
brown
light
ale
on
the
nose
delicious
light
chocolate
flavor
small
hints
of
brown
sugar
really
good
sessionable
brown
ales
in
fact
one
of
the
best
i
can
remember
i
rather
liked
this
one
a
lot
of
brown
ales
look
good
to
me
but
disappoint
once
you
actually
taste
them
but
this
one
delivers
on
the
flavor
d
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
brown
ale
perhaps
a
touch
darker
than
most
malt
focused
with
little
in
the
way
of
hop
character
but
a
balanced
finish
overall
the
complexity
is
nice
for
the
style
and
its
not
too
bland
this
is
beer
review
number
1000
for
me
thus
completing
the
smithj4
jazbo
challenge
1000
unique
beers
in
one
year
enjoyed
this
beer
with
metter98
my
wife
ellie
and
my
brown
dog
tsuki
thanks
to
my
wife
ellie
for
supporting
me
in
this
challenge
which
i
completed
in
9
months
and
4
days
just
before
the
birth
of
my
frist
child
daughter
also
important
that
i
got
to
have
it
in
a
can
since
that
is
my
favorite
serving
type
the
body
was
the
typical
smooth
even
and
full
you
look
for
drinkability
was
very
good
the
beer
goes
down
easily
and
having
multiples
would
be
easy
overall
a
nice
take
on
the
style
nothing
about
this
beer
is
really
notable
but
there
are
also
no
real
flaws
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
brown
ale
you
could
certainly
do
a
lot
worse
than
having
one
of
these
plus
i
love
labs
so
any
beer
with
one
on
the
label
will
be
showing
up
in
my
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
diamonds
are
forever
o
i
really
do
like
a
quantity
of
beers
from
avery
namely
their
top
shelf
ipas
this
is
a
solid
brown
that
i
continue
to
revisit
could
be
a
bit
more
rounded
but
a
good
showing
overall
overall
a
decent
brown
but
nothing
tootoo
extraordinary
worth
a
try
if
you
have
never
had
it
quality
stuf
o
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
that
has
a
bouns
of
some
hop
aroma
and
flavor
very
nice
i
would
buy
this
agin
dark
brown
almost
black
in
the
glass
with
a
healthy
head
and
good
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
some
chocolate
malts
hops
are
mild
and
offset
by
the
malt
this
beer
is
almost
a
dessert
with
carmelized
brown
sugar
flavor
can
fall
a
little
flat
on
the
tongue
but
overall
well
done
medium
bodied
with
a
light
to
medium
effervescence
aftertaste
is
a
bit
ashy
with
malt
wood
and
peat
lingering
a
good
brew
overall
id
give
it
a
3
5
overall
this
is
a
very
strong
example
of
the
style
it
is
also
a
great
example
of
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
served
at
the
proper
temperature
when
cold
a
lot
of
the
flavors
are
masked
but
as
it
approaches
50
degrees
or
so
a
lot
more
comes
out
overall
its
pretty
good
whats
the
difference
between
this
and
a
stout
they
seem
so
similar
a
great
brown
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
category
i
would
most
certainly
buy
this
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
clear
dark
brown
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
theres
just
enough
light
passing
through
to
make
out
some
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
there
are
aromas
of
dark
roasted
barley
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
it
also
smells
a
little
nutty
with
the
taste
i
pick
up
the
roasted
malt
very
strongly
with
some
accompanying
sweetness
i
also
detect
the
chocolate
coffee
and
nutty
flavors
i
found
in
the
aroma
the
body
is
medium
with
plentiful
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
is
a
brown
ale
i
would
recommend
o
ellies
brown
ale
is
a
really
good
brown
ale
that
i
am
glad
i
revisited
inspiring
me
to
try
a
homebrewed
brown
ale
overy
good
brown
ale
porterstout
like
in
flavor
very
sessionable
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
slightly
high
carbonation
super
drinkable
and
tasty
i
was
impressed
sometimes
you
need
a
nice
brown
ale
to
remind
you
how
good
this
basic
and
mostly
unheralded
style
can
be
a
lot
more
subtle
and
artful
than
most
of
averys
overthetop
offerings
in
my
book
o
a
nice
malty
brown
but
pretty
simple
for
an
avery
brew
o
a
great
brown
ale
a
solid
core
beer
in
averys
lineup
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
one
back
in
march
it
was
a
pleasure
to
have
once
again
ill
come
back
to
this
one
quite
often
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
tulip
glass
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
large
tan
head
which
leaves
a
lacing
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
bread
malts
a
little
nutty
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
okay
its
not
very
strong
you
get
some
caramel
and
bread
malts
with
a
very
mild
hop
bite
oncask
at
the
avery
taproom
in
boulder
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
brown
ales
so
when
i
saw
this
on
offer
in
cask
form
it
was
easy
to
pass
by
some
of
the
more
exotic
taproom
offerings
wellmade
easydrinking
and
perfectly
balanced
cocoa
roasted
nuttiness
toffee
anise
and
caramel
backed
by
an
earthy
hop
element
seriously
smooth
with
a
gentle
carbonation
thoroughly
enjoyable
o
nothing
fancy
here
just
a
well
built
brown
ale
that
goes
down
easy
overall
b
brown
ales
are
not
usually
my
favorite
but
this
is
a
good
one
drinks
like
a
meal
drink
it
too
fast
and
you
might
miss
out
on
some
nice
flavor
notes
this
is
one
to
take
down
slowly
and
enjoy
o
very
tasty
brown
ale
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
come
across
ill
buy
it
again
and
i
would
recommend
to
friends
good
brown
ale
can
definitely
taste
the
darker
malts
didnt
have
much
head
but
was
adequately
carbonated
also
had
in
a
can
and
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
there
was
too
much
carbonation
in
the
can
and
but
couldnt
realize
the
full
taste
until
it
warmed
up
a
bit
which
of
course
is
more
drinkers
error
would
drink
again
but
would
drink
out
of
the
bottle
or
glass
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
a
nice
flavor
and
affordable
price
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
cans
from
gbx
as
a
flyer
had
never
tried
this
before
and
always
looking
from
new
browns
got
home
and
poured
into
a
snifter
beautiful
mahogany
and
medium
brown
with
a
generous
head
and
good
lacing
and
spotting
smell
was
a
surprise
carmel
and
nuts
took
over
the
aroma
and
it
was
a
nice
blend
of
the
two
perhaps
some
brown
sugar
on
the
end
as
well
taste
was
what
really
caught
my
attention
very
smooth
blend
of
malts
and
hops
like
the
carmel
mixing
with
the
hops
to
give
a
little
complexity
to
this
brew
feel
was
a
little
heavy
carbonation
but
not
over
the
top
more
toward
the
thick
end
for
me
overall
a
very
nice
surprise
sessionable
brown
with
tons
of
flavor
and
a
great
blend
avery
got
this
right
and
its
growing
on
me
a
very
solid
brown
that
will
find
its
way
into
regular
rotation
big
finish
on
this
beer
rich
chocolate
and
caramel
nuttiness
throughout
the
beer
delivers
a
punch
of
well
blended
rich
flavors
in
one
quick
sip
big
full
body
despite
the
heavy
carbonation
the
beer
holds
up
lingering
nutty
and
tannic
finish
with
drying
bitter
cocoa
flavors
hop
presence
kicks
in
just
in
time
to
separate
the
start
of
the
brew
from
the
finish
complex
with
a
certain
layered
depth
yet
extremely
concise
at
the
same
time
big
flavor
for
such
a
small
brew
pours
a
very
silky
creamy
dark
bron
color
with
a
nice
head
right
at
the
first
smell
you
can
smell
lots
of
vanilla
roasted
barley
almost
a
porter
like
aroma
but
more
fruity
it
has
a
nice
medium
body
creamy
body
with
touch
of
roastiness
and
molasses
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
after
taste
overall
its
a
very
nice
brown
ale
definetly

gonna
buy
some

for

this
is
a
very
smooth
flavorful
beer
that
has
great
balance
and
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
overall
this
is
just
a
really
well
crafted
brown
ale
it
goes
down
really
smooth
at
5
5
abv
and
makes
a
good

great
complexity

profile
ellies
brown
ale
brew
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
light
tan
head
that
provides
some
decent
lace
throughout
sweet
malt
aromas
dominate
with
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
very
noticeable
the
sweet
maltiness
in
the
nose
is
also
present
in
the
flavor
with
the
pallet
being
able
to
pick
up
some
brown
sugar
light
vanilla
and
some
nuttiness
in
addition
to
stronger
chocolate
and
caramel
favors
lighter
amounts
of
carbonation
help
make
this
medium
bodied
ale
smooth
and
creamy
a
great
colorado
example
of
a
classic
served
ontap
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
light
clear
chestnut
highlighted
brown
coloring
with
a
foamy
frothy
light
tan
head
good
head
retention
with
a
solid
cling
while
you
drink
aromas
are
light
coffee
cream
and
nutty
highlights
with
a
toffee
sweetness
throughout
flavors
are
smooth
and
super
easy
to
drink
with
a
nutty
creamy
backbone
that
is
similar
to
peanut
butter
with
some
fruity
sweet
highlights
roasted
characteristics
bring
the
beer
back
down
to
a
close
leading
to
a
slightly
sweet
nutty
aftertaste
the
finish
is
kept
light
and
somewhat
crisp
by
the
carbonation
levels
but
still
manages
to
give
off
a
slight
filmy
linger
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
o
seems
to
meet
the
standard
for
a
great
brown
o
pretty
good
brown
ale
d
while
its
not
excellent
this
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
because
the
flavors
are
smooth
and
relatively
subtle
as
the
bottle
suggests
this
one
is
quaffable
indeed
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
received
in
a
beer
of
the
month
sixpack
from
vintage
cellar
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
darker
head
of
about
2
fingers
dissipates
slowly
light
malty
smell
roasted
nutty
taste
but
not
really
strong
nice
chocolatey
malt
taste
appears
later
as
drinking
it
down
carbonation
is
fine
and
it
goes
down
smooth
but
has
a
little
bit
of
an
aftertaste
but
it
is
not
really
unpleasant
overall
an
ok
beer
a
slightly
above
average
brown
ale
o
a
miraculously
complex
brown
ale
that
somehow
keeps
a
low
abv
the
flavors
all
work
nicely
together
id
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
ale
that
delivers
all
the
goods
easy
simple
and
quite
tasty
a
perfect
session
ale
on
a
cold
january
night
o
very
nice
for
a
brown
ale
almost
comparable
to
fat
squirrel
which
is
one
of
my
favorites
review
2200
been
revisiting
a
few
of
my
earlycareer
brews
and
ive
looked
forward
to
this
one
remembering
it
as
one
of
the
better
browns
of
those
days
lets
see
if
it
still
holds
such
a
rank
it
pours
a
clear
rubysienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
wan
ecru
foam
the
nose
is
a
blast
of
caramel
with
maybe
tiny
corpuscles
of
mild
cocoa
and
lightly
toasted
biscuit
floating
in
the
deep
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
some
roast
does
indeed
make
it
through
at
times
even
if
only
at
tebowlevel
consistency
theres
some
light
butteredbiscuit
and
dark
greens
notes
in
there
as
well
but
they
also
constitute
tiny
minorities
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
brown
nothing
overtly
special
but
something
eminently
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
this
beer
is
quite
nice
i
suggest
you
serve
this
beer
at
or
above
cellar
temp
as
this
is
where
the
beer
really
starts
to
shine
first
uo
tnight
is
lab
tested
ellies
brown
ale
from
avery

beer
poured
a
deep
clear
brown
amber
with
offwhtie
head
that
lacing
nicely
the
smell
carries
carmal
malt
the
taste
has
a
sweet
malt
start
followed
by
roasty
slight
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is

carbonation
overall
it
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
mf
light
to
moderate
body
with
flavors
that
dont
last
too
long
on
the
palate
i
dig
it
i
like
the
logo
and
while
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
a
brown
i
would
totally
order
this
one
again
especially
when
its
cold
outside
o
one
of
the
more
outstanding
browns
ive
had
the
only
ones
i
can
think
of
off
the
top
of
my
head
that
i
would
take
over
this
would
be
smutty
old
brown
dog
and
abita
turbodog
what
is
it
with
all
these
dogs

lightmedium
in

with
abundant

smooth
drinking
overall
its
a
good
brown
ale
that
borders
very
good
but
doesnt
go
the
extra
mile
to
differentiate
itself
overall
a
nice
and
simple
brown
ale
i
have
had
this
in
a
can
plenty
of
times
and
happy
to
have
it
on
draft
o
very
solid
brown
ale
smell
is
ridiculously
good
balanced
flavors
and
tasty
cant
go
wrong
with
this
brew
well
done
o
top
notch
brown
ale
loved
it
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
pretty
damn
good
american
brown
ale
it
had
a
pretty
nice
malt
profile
to
it
and
the
extra
nuttiness
in
this
beer
was
pretty
good
it
was
so
nutty
that
i
think
it
should
be
called
ellies
nut
brown
ale
this
beer
had
very
good
drinkability
for
an
american
brown
ale
it
went
down
really
smooth
had
a
good
mouthfeel
and
it
had
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
wanting
to
drink
it
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
the
malt
profile
was
dead
on
for
an
american
brown
ale
and
i
really
like
the
extra
nuttiness
in
this
beer
and
the
mouthfeel
was
right
where
it
should
be
there
wasnt
really
anything
i
didnt
like
about
this
beer
no
complaints
here
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
the
extra
nuttiness
makes
this
a
good
beer
for
late
fall
or
early
winter
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
brown
ales
and
if
you
like
them
nutty
then
you
will
really
like
this
beer
so
far
i
have
been
pretty
impressed
with
the
beers
that
avery
puts
in
cans
they
have
all
been
pretty
exceptional
for
their
style
i
am
having
a
fun
time
checking
out
averys
beers
i
just
picked
up
a
bottle
of
their
quad
so
i
hope
it
is
just
as
impressive
as
this
beer
is
great
job
avery
keep
it
up
good
to
see
this
in
cans
but
the
beer
iself
is
not
interesting
enough
to
make
me
revisit
this
often
o
a
good
brown
ale
that
doesnt
get
boring
o
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
great
fallwinter
brew
and
it
looks
great
in
a
pint
glass
too
the
malty
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
really
helps
the
beer
as
good
a
brown
as
ive
had
anywhere
pours
a
translucent
dark
copper
color
with
a
gorgeous
head
lacing
the
glass
every
sip
smells
malty
and
robust
but
not
that
english
newcastle
type
of
way
its
a
more
textured
laid
back
malt
profile
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
molasses
in
the
finish
body
is
just
a
bit
thin
for
me
here
my
only
critique
of
an
excellent
beer
carbonation
is
perfect
and
the
finish
is
great
slow
and
a
little
smokey
even
resonant
and
memorable
this
is
a
well
made
beer
perfect
with
a
grilled
duck
breast
and
cabbage
o
i
tend
to
like
a
hop
finish
that
few
brown
ales
provide
ellies
brown
delivers
a
flavorful
experience
with
drinkability
that
makes
you
go
back
for
more
avery
likes
to
push
the
hop
envelope
i
find
hoppy
brews
best
enjoyed
from
the
tap
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
a
nice
malty
alternative
to
typical
canned
swill
the
mouth
feel
is
also
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
but
it
is
still
decent
enough
as
is
thats
what
this
beer
is
decent
enough
as
is
its
a
little
frustrating
that
avery
looks
like
they
about
did
something
really
special
avery
rarely
dissapoints
and
this
is
one
more
tasty
style
to
come
from
them
give
this
is
a
newcastle
drinker
it
should
chnage
the
way
they
look
at
the
style
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
i
would
drink
it
again
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
minimal
and
the
retention
didnt
really
do
too
much
either
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
light
roasted
nut
aroma
with
some
sweet
malts
in
there
as
well
the
flavors
of
the
beer
was
roasted
some
light
flavors
of
some
coffee
and
nuts
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
watery
and
dry
overall
this
brew
wasnt
terrible
but
i
just
wasnt
too
thrilled
about
it
3
0
d
this
would
be
a
pretty
good
beer
if
the
mash
temp
was
a
good
bit
higher
the
mouthfeel
is
weak
and
brings
down
the
whole
experience
to
average
o
nice
beer
good
complexity
and
a
solid
example
of
the
style
worth
seeking
out
o
a
decent
little
brown
refreshing
with
some
great
roasted
malts
its
simple
but
still
quite
solid
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
puffy
1
inch
light
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
thin
broken
rings
of
foamy
lace
stick
to
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
chocolate
vanilla
and
roasted
nuts
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
roasted
nuts
cocoa
powder
and
some
vanilla
flavors
a
nice
roasty
flavor
lingers
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
bubbly
but
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
with
some
very
nice
aromas
and
flavors
i
usually
dont
like
brown
ales
too
much
but
this
one
is
great
a
very
nice
drinking
brown
ale
very
smooth
and
flavorful
well
worth
getting
if
you
like
brown
ales
d
extremely
well
built
and
drinkable
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
many
widely
available
examples
better
than
this
one
overall
a
little
but
it
taste
good
i
like
this
ale
all
around
plus
i
love
dogs
and
like
the
story
behind
its
name
cheers
very
dark
brown
w
red
highlights
one
finger
beige
head
that
stuck
only
slightly
to
the
glass
smell
is
all
chocolate
with
some
english
hops
i
guessed
goldings
but
the
their
website
states
bullion
cascade
and
fuggles
taste
is
roasty
chocolate
with
a
nice
amount
of
sweetness
that
ends
semi
dry
carb
is
mild
giving
it
a
creamy
quality
at
this
time
id
say
its
probably
my
second
favorite
american
brown
if
you
enjoy
browns
at
all
you
should
definitely
put

overall
this
is
really
great

a
straightforward
american
brown

i
would
like
to
drink
67
of
these
at
a
sitting
o
great
brown
ale
smooth
and
recommended
good
value
would
drink
again
ive
never
been
the
biggest
fan
of
american
browns
having
generally
found
that
the
hops
overwhelm
the
malt
not
here
in
fact
i
would
suggest
that
ellies
brown
ale
is
closer
to
the
northern
english
style
all
the
better
for
it
in
my
opinion
a
truly
lovely
beer
dont
drink
and
review
very
nice
a
smooth
slightly
burned
malty
smell

easily

and
a
great

able

in
my
opinion
i
will
buy
again
and
i
would
reccomend
this
beer
poured
a
rusty
brown
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
that
left
some
beautiful
thick
lacing
aroma
was
nutty
and
sweet
with
caramel
and
chocolate
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
nutty
sweet
caramelloy
and
a
mild
earthiness
from
a
light
hoppage
mediumbodied
smooth
and
quite
good
not
sure
if
id
repeat
but
its
certainly
a
complex
and
interesting
beer
12
ounce
can
no
dating
but
it
cant
be
too
old
pours
slightly
cloudy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
dense
2
finger
off
white
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
fairly
thick
lacing
cap
a
small
bit
of
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
as
you
drink
as
well
aromas
of
caramel
roasted
malt
chocolate
nutmeg
and
molasses
very
nice
aromas
but
a
little
muted
taste
of
huge
caramel
chocolate
roasted
malt
nutmeg
vanilla
molasses
and
a
bit
of
citrus
small
amount
of
bitterness
present
on
the
finish
that
lingers
with
caramel
chocolate
and
light
citrus
flavor
medium
carbonation
and
body
very
nice
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
maximum
drinkability
no
alcohol
in
the
taste
or
finish
as
expected
overall
this
is
definitely
an
outstanding
brown
ale
tons
of
flavor
complexity
and
smooth
drinkability
o
i
really
like
this
brown
ale
of
all
the
ones
ive
tried
this
has
definitely
been
one
of
the
best
looking
refreshing
nutty
and
coffeelike
one
of
my
new
favorites
comes
out
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
nice
thick
coffee
colored
head
recedes
slowly
to
a
ring
with
good
lacing
nose
is
coffee
chocolate
and
nuts
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
coffee
chocolate
and
nuts
bit
of
a
hop
bite
thats
not
overwhelming
but
noticeable
it
comes
on
slowly
and
mildly
but
lingers
well
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
this
is
one
fine
brown
ale
o
this
is
what
a
nonhoppy
brown
ale
should
taste
like
i
do
wish
i
know
how
fresh
this
was
though
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
would
try
again
roof
carbonation
rolls
easily
and
it
goes
down
smoothe
i
got
it
because
it
was
one
of
the
few
at
the
local
marketplace
that
i
hadnt
tried
that
looked
like
it
might
be
up
my
alley
and
indeed
it
was
i
like
this
brew
though
ive
had
better
i
would
absolutely
buy
it
again
if
the
mood
struck
but
it
wouldnt
be
the
first
one
i
would
grab
for
in
a
hurry
a
well
crafted
beer
and
one
well
worth
at
least
checking
out
its
similar
to
an
amber
but
better
not
bad
but
not
great
and
its
brown
this
brew
pours
a
deep
chestnut
brown
crested
with
a
finger
of
head
that
sticks
around
for
quite
some
time
the
aroma
is
nice
theres
a
full
roasty
nutty
maltiness
to
this
theres
also
caramel
cocoa
and
coffee
in
here
a
robust
aroma
the
taste
is
a
robust
caramel
maltiness
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
roasted
nuts
not
quite
as
alluring
as
the
nose
lets
on
but
still
quite
good
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
got
a
body
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
is
fairly
briskly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
about
average
for
style
overall
a
great
brown
ale
a
solid
choice
pours
dark
brown
with
little
to
no
head
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
molasses
tastes
much
the
same
very
smooth
and
pretty
tasty
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
there
are
better
brown
ales
out
there
t
medium
body
sweet
notes
a
very
nice
toast
flavour
malty
flavour
too
dry
finish
and
some
hop
aftertaste
a
very
nice
brew
in
the
brown
ale
line
this
brew
poured
up
a
dark
mahoganycolored
body
sporting
an
amazingly
thick
cream
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
combine
to
make
a
mediumbodied
very
smooth
creamy
malty
sweet
brown
ale
with
subtle
hints
of
robust
coffee
with
a
finish
thats
only
lightly
hoppy
and
not
bitter
tones
overall
i
like
it
but
its
quite
different
from
the
regular
brown
ales
i
have
had
this
a
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
ranks
up
there
with
dfh
india
brown
ale
and
bells
best
though
bells
is
more
of
a
traditional
brown
pours
from
the
can
with
a
deep
nearly
opaque
chestnut
brown
and
a
billowy
beige
head
that
laces
nicely
against
the
walls
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
light
and
clean
with
some
dry
nuttiness
a
hint
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
a
minerallike
character
the
flavor
is
slightly
more
substantial
but
still
not
dense
with
a
pleasant
combination
of
light
caramel
candied
cashews
and
a
bit
of
mossy
hops
and
smoldering
firewood
to
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
that
does
help
this
one
go
down
even
easier
overall
this
isnt
the
boldest
or
most
flavorful
american
brown
but
it
is
an
easydrinking
selection
that
isnt
going
to
turn
anyone
off
glad
to
find
this
one
in
cans
my
preferred
serving
method
at
home
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
cap
of
light
brown
foam
good
chocolatey
nose
with
hints
of
coffee
and
roasted
nuts
on
the
palate
rich
and
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
with
roasted
malt
caramel
and
milk
chocolate
garnetrubyrusset
add
that
to
the
data
bank
with
nequality
clarity
and
cola
highlights
beautiful
the
nose
was
immediately
rich
with
vanilla
notes
and
leaning
in
i
also
got
milk
chocolate
and
an
almond
nuttiness
was
i
drinking
a
beer
or
having
a
dessert
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
on
the
upper
end
approaching
creaminess
lots
of
flavors
going
on
in
the
mouth
but
you
had
better
like
sweets
i
got
got
milk
chocolate
almonds
or
pecans
and
even
a
light
smokiness
fantastic
finish
was
somewhat
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
taste
but
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
it
stylistically
i
would
definitely
put
some
in
my
cooler
for
the
malty
beer
set
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
a
little
plain
tasting
in
my
opinion
however
its
not
bland
at
all
i
just
dont
pick
up
anything
super
special
about
it
still
tastes
good
just
not
interesting
rich
transparent
brown
color
with
a
medium
sized
frothy
off

head
sweet
brown
ale
malt
characteristics
in
the
nose
some
tame
leafy
hops
as
well
lightmedium
in
body
the
beer
is
creamy
while
still
remaining
crisp
and
refreshing
an
awesome
brown
ale
excellent
must
try
overall
a
pretty
decent
version
of
a
brown
ale
on
the
sweeter
side
but
has
enough
balance
to
make
it
a
pretty
good
brew
this
was
a
very
nice
take
on
an
american
brown
ale
from
avery
with
the
type
of
full
flavored
profile
that
seems
to
be
sorely
missing
from
this
style
lately
i
really
dug
this
one
and
im
really
glad
that
they
have
this
available
in
cans
now
i
love
these
little
cool
12oz
cans
and
also
when
someone
loves
their
dogs
as
much
as
i
do
especially
when
i
see
they
named
their
brew
after
her
cos
firstly
it
shows
passion
and
honestly
if
i
had
my
own
brewery
id
do
exactly
the
same
and
it
pours
a
deep
mahogany
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
nice
two
finger
head
and
clingy
lacing
here
and
therethe
smell
is
sweet
bready
maltsdark
plumsbrown
sugara
touch
of
vanilla
and
a
very
subtle
light
fruity
hoppinessit
has
a
lightmedium
bodied
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
has
tastes
of
vanillalight
chocolatebrown
sugarhazelnuts
and
is
finished
with
just
a
touch
of
subtle
light
fruity
hops
that
really
evens
out
the
tailend
of
this
drop
to
make
it
a
very
sessionable
aba
and
i
will
buy
again
without
doubt
appearance
is
a
brown
color
with
a
good
sized
offwhite
head
to
it
its
smell
is
faint
overall
but
has
some
fruit
along
with
some
malt
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
on
the
lighter
side
for
the
most
part
well
balanced
mf
is
medium
ok
carbonation
ellies
is
a
pretty
nice
brown
ale
not
sure
where
i
stand
on
this
beer
enjoyed
but
not
savoured
drunkability
great
smell
and
good
taste
parts
of
the
palate
are
very
complex
but
others
are
rathar
lifeless
mineral
water
not
my
favorite
brown
but
it
rates
in
the
top
ten
for
sure
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
mmmm
this
is
a
good
beer
but
what
exactly
is
the
difference
in
a
porter
and
a
brown
ale
cause
this
honestly
tastes
more
like
an
american
style
porter
than
a
brown
ale
overall
a
beer
i
will
look
for
again
enough
flavors
to
keep
you
guessing
and
enough
heft
to
make
you
appreciate
the
flavors
to
bad
the
aroma
is
lacking
the
brewery
makes
several
beers
on
my
want
list
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
a
little
more
stark
more
porter
like
but
its
definitely
a
brown
ale
a
thin
one
at
that
there
is
a
bitterness
too
detracting
from
the
overall
experience
in
my
opinion
i
taste
nuts
dried
fruit
thats
about
it
dark
redbrown
beer
with
about
a
finger
of
bubbly
head
that
dissolves
pretty
slowly
plenty
of
lacing
as
the
glass
is
emptied
roasty
caramel
and
chocolate
aromas
with
some
slight
citrus
and
coffee
tart
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
seem
to
be
the
dominant
flavors
with
some
fruit
and
spices
on
the
back
end
great
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
nice
fullbodied
ale
but
goes
down
easily
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
drinking
experience
yeah
thats
a
very
enjoyable
sweet
yet
sessionable
beer
im
a
fan
o
one
of
the
better
browns
ive
tasted
quite
drinkable
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
as
a
session
beer
3
5
overall
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
not
as
thick
as
i
really
like
but
definitely
a
brew
worthy
of
trying
in
the
brown
ale
category
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
it
is
not
overpowering
but
it
is
a
very
nice
aroma
and
exactly
what
i
expect
in
this
style
of
beer
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
lot
of
milk
chocolate
with
a
little
toasted
malt
and
caramel
malt
there
is
a
little
bit
of
pecan
or
hazelnut
flavor
and
quite
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
sweet
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
easy
to
drink
very
nice
brown
ale
caramel
and
molasses
seem
to
be
in
the
mouthfeel
bitterness
wanes
as
more
of
the
sweet
and
smooth
side
finally
come
out
a
little
more
complex
than
your
average
brown
ale
i
figured
i
would
give
this
one
a
straight
up
pour
since
i
usually
tilt
the
glass
and
go
for
a
smaller
head
then
read
about
them
in
the
other
reviews
ended
up
with
a
good
2
finger
or
so
head
tan
in
color
on
the
very
dark
brown
beer
the
head
was
slow
to
dissipate
and
the
lacing
stuck
around
for
a
while
smells
nice
and
thick
with
a
caramel
hint
and
what
i
would
call
more
cocoa
than
chocolate
it
has
a
deep
malty
taste
and
the
cocoa
really
stays
with
you
throughout
with
the
beer
almost
clinging
to
the
sides
of
your
mouth
not
bad
but
a
little
strong
with
the
cocoa
ive
had
other
brown
ales
that
i
would
prefer
over
this
though
it
isnt
one
i
would
push
away
call
it
an
average
brown
ale
from
my
standpoint
excellent
showing
for
the
style
very
nice
brown
ale
overall
i
like
it
this
is
a
great
beer
in
my
top
2
american
browns
will
flip
between
this
and
smuttys
dog
sampled
from
a
can
with
no
freshness
date
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
started
with
a
fluffy
light
beige
head
that
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
and
a
few
wet
lacings
on
the
glass
sweet
molasses
and
nutty
aromas
are
prominent
with
hints
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
floral
hops
medium
bodied
with
pleasnant
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
sweet
caramel
malt
and
nutty
flavors
in
the
beginning
with
nice
floral
hoppy
flavors
through
the
middle
and
a
clean
finish
pleaant
floral
hoppy
character
seems
to
creep
back
in
after
the
finish
not
your
tyical
brown
ale
lots
of
flavor
and
aroma
complexity
mouthfeel
goes
from
creamy
to
sour
really
fast
smooth
carbonation
lets
the
malts
shine
but
a
bitterness
that
reminds
me
of
burnt
coffee
is
present
still
a
great
beer
and
one
thats
easy
to
drink
and
vey
satisfying
o
a
good
brown
ale
thats
well
worth
a
try
not
the
best
brown
ive
ever
had
but
very
well
done
ill
return
to
this
one
if
i
run
across
it
again
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
promises
lots
of
malt
and
delivers
too
much
this
beer
was
cloyingly
sweet
for
me
needed
a
bit
more
balance
for
a
brown
ale
not
too
much
body
to
it
pretty
thin
for
an
ale
as
well
malt
is
not
overpowering
at
all
but
somehow
the
sugar
is
im
sure
there
are
some
nuts
in
there
as
well
but
all
i
tasted
is
sweet
overall
a
definite
winner
and
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
easy
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
taste
is
excellent
firm
and
deep
character
with
nuttychocolate
toasty
bread
lightly
sweet
caramelized
barley
yup
front
then
more
balanced
and
drier
finish
with
light
woodypepperyearthy
bitterness
feel
is
nice
full
lightly
creamy
overall
this
is
excellent
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
red
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
quickly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malt
caramel
dark
chocolate
and
subtle
wheat
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
wasnt
too
bad
of
a
brown
ale
the
bitterness
and
sweetness
in
this
one
were
quite
well
balanced
with
that
this
was
not
the
best
brown
ive
had
but
still
pretty
good
for
me
if
the
roastiness
was
toned
down
a
little
bit
to
allow
some
of
the
other
elements
to
shine
through
this
one
would
have
been
much
better
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
though
o
very
solid
brown
ale
probably
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
so
far
could
easily
sit
back
and
drink
a
few
of
these
liked
how
it
was
a
bit
lighter
than
most
browns
but
didnt
lose
anything
in
terms
of
flavor
overall
a
great
brown
ale
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
roasted
sweet
notes
and
the
light
bitter
crispness
great
sipper
and
something
good
to
have
on
standby
in
the
fridge
if
you
like
brown
ales
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
good
straight
forward
brown
ale
nothing
over
complicated
just
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
this
beer
reminds
me
of
fall
but
could
also
be
enjoyed
in
the
winter
and
on
into
spring
on
the
beer
takehome
scale
i
would
grab
a
case
and
keep
this
one
as
one
of
the
staples
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
backlit
and
a
fine
mocha
head
that
leaves
rings
of
crusty
lace
on
the
glass
coffee
chocolate
and
nice
floral
hops
make
for
a
tasty
smelling
beer
cocoa
powder
and
java
with
some
nice
fruity
hoppiness
to
balance
nicely
medium
bodied
with
slightly
stinging
carbonation
easy
drinking
and
delicious
a
really
good
brown
ale
overall
a
nice
bold
tasting
brown
ale
typical
of
the
style
smooth
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
i
am
hooked
from
the
first
taste
of
avery
brewing
ellies
brown
ale
a
gorgeous
light
mahogany
color
with
a
sticky
light
tan
head
very
nutty
and
roasted
but
not
much
smoke
or
charring
the
finish
is
dry
woody
and
earthy
lots
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
maybe
even
some
brown
sugar
in
there
an
average
5
5
abv
but
thats
fine
because
this
is
one
youll
want
to
drink
all
night
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
brew
i
could
easily
put
away
a
sixer
of
these
id
like
to
try
from
the
bottle
to
see
if
it
improves
carbonation
and
erases
that
tart
aftertaste
in
all
another
good
american
beer
ill
put
it
on
my
grocery
list
next
time
in
the
states
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
that
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
wow
this
was
extremely
good
im
wondering
if
it
was
a
good
idea
to
switch
to
goose
island
and
312
or
should
i
have
stayed
on
this
beer
to
see
if
it
really
was
drinkable
i
say
it
was
enjoyed
without
a
struggle
at
all
try
it
drinkability
this
beer
would
make
a
good
session
beer
for
watching
a
football
game
or
for
a
longlasting
game
of
cards
but
otherwise
is
not
particularly
distinguished
in
any
way
its
easy
to
drink
repeatedly
over
the
course
of
a
night
and
has
decent
value
all
in
all
id
buy
and
drink
it
again
pours
a
brownish
with
some
nice
red
tint
a
good
amount
of
white
head
lots
of
lacing
and
an
okay
look
smells
sweet
and
malty
fairly
nondescript
overall
not
very
impressive
the
taste
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
not
very
tasty
but
not
bad
in
any
way
highly
carbonated
sweet
and
a
bit
bitter
from
the
roast
pretty
drinkable
but
overall
not
very
impressive
dvery
drinkable
done
with
my
taste
in
no
time
nothing
barnburning
but
a
decent
ale
all
around
highly
drinkable
and
wellbrewed
cocoa
and
toasted
biscuits
lots
of
chocolate
notes
and
hints
of
coffee
and
earthy
ashy
notes
the
color
is
the
same
as
chocolate
milk
and
there
is
a
muddy
dirty
consistency
quite
chewy
and
thick
brown
ale
easy
to
drink
this
but
a
bit
on
the
thick
side
for
its
style
a
little
chalky
and
heavy
nice
complex
flavor
and
armoa

another
craft
brewery

producing
some
of
their
year
round
products
in
cans
ellies
brown
pours
out
a
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
large
creamy
white
head
coffee
and
caramel
come
to
mind
upon
smelling
followed
by
some
herbal
tea
characters
and
a
hint
of
smoke
more
of
the
same
from
the
flavors
with
the
mouthfeel
being
medium
and
creamy
drinkability
is
superb
as
it
is
loaded
with
complexities
yet
still
easy
and
approachable
this
brown
has
session
ale
written
all
over
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
and
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
it
goes
down
easily
and
is
something
that
is
definitely
enjoyable
drinkability
very
good
beer
it
seems
like
it
is
almost
a
chocolate
stout
masquerading
as
a
brown
ale
could
probably
have
this
multiple
times
in
one
night
this
is
a
fantastic
brown
aleenormous
aroma
great
flavor
silky
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
sit
around
and
drink
these
all
night
not
too
shabby
the
pils
was
better
but
this
one
is
not
bad
either
a
little
bit
better
balance
of
the
malt
and
hops
would
be
welcome
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brownish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
in
the
taste
just
like
the
aroma
chocolate
and
roasty
malt
with
a
small
hop
presence
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
roast
of
chocolate
more
a
porter
than
a
brown
light
body
but
ok
flavors
are
pretty
simple
but
very
appealing
light
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
grains
with
a
lightmedium
bitter
end
palate
and
finish
simple
but
appealing
and
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
at
first
i
did
not
enjoy
the
bitter
roastiness
but
it
has
grown
on
me
it
balances
the
sweetness
and
leaves
me
craving
the
next
sip
notes
a
solid
brown
ale
nothing
like
the
classic
brown
but
definitely
preferred
to
it
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
definitely
would
although
my
wife
would
probably
drink
it
before
i
did
she
loves
brown
ales
and
she
loves
dogs
taste
is
roasted
malt
primarily
but
a
slight
bit
of
sweetness
and
a
tinge
of
hops
i
get
a
bit
of
chocolate
but
its
not
really
predominant
at
all
overall
its
just
a
medium
bodied
standard
brown
ale
that
makes
for
an
enjoyable
drink
pours
a
murky
light
brown
with
thin
spots
of
offwhite
head
little
retention
and
lacing
scent
brings
lightly
sweet
malt
and
roasted
nuts
some
earthyness
and
well
and
a
somewhat
defined
hop
charachter
stronger
than
most
in
style
taste
is
nutty
and
lightly
sweet
as
the
scent
would
dictate
earthy
hop
qualities
and
some
breadyness
as
well
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
its
only
major
knock
decent
level
of
lower
carbonation
somewhat
dry
a
decent

undone
by
its

that
dissipates
to
a

the
nose

chocolalte
the

drinkability
is

this
is
a
good
one
to

ona
regular
basis
overall
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
even
with
a
low
abv
it
still
has
rich
flavors
that
make
this
a
very
drinkable
d
i
find
this
to
be
an
under
appreciated
beer
in
a
style
that
usually
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
easy
to
finish
and
im
happy
that
i
decided
to
go
with
the
whole
sixer
instead
of
a
single
this
is
a
much
darker
brown
ale
than
id
expected
it

was

shine
this

is

and

drinkability
a
nice
brown
ale
that
is
refreshingly
tasty
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
ive
had
much
better
from
avery
its
a
little
thin
for
a
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
and
not
quite
tasty
enough
being
and
english
style
i
suppose
its
supposed
to
be
a
little
mild
though
but
i
think
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
a
decent
murky
brown
color
little
head
smell
is
a
tad
hoppy
for
a
brown
ale
and
has
hints
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
but
nothing
really
unusual
or
particularly
intriguing
taste
is
much
the
same
light
and
hoppy
and
not
as
malty
and
roasty
as
your
traditional
brown
ale
almost
like
a
simple
apa
with
some
toasted
malt
thrown
in
not
really
a
brown
ale
like
i
said
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
which
i
usually
like
but
in
this
beer
something
was
lacking
drinkable
beer
though
not
bad
dont
get
me
wrong
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more

almost
what
i

is

of
grains
and
comes
with
a

at

a

i
like
the

in

so
well
stick

are

i
didnt

to

the

reached
about

collapsed

was

i

there
was

i
couldn¬ít
find
any
the
nose
is

fatty
for
me
i
like
my
brown

to
be
sharper
the
nose
is

it
is

just
not

it
makes
me
want
to
take
a
sip
i¬ím
just
not

i
love
brown

and
this
one
is

the
palate
is
malty
with
depth
that
fits
the
style

malts
very
weak
hints
of

flashes
of
toasted

the
sweetness
plays

nicer
than
the

indicated
flashes

heat
are
oddly
enjoyable
if
not
misplaced
it
acts
nicely
towards
some

spicy
hops

the

i
don¬ít
want
to
say
this
beer
falls
apart
because
it
doesn¬ít
it
just
fades
a

dry
astringent
aftertaste
overall
the
palate
is
good
it
is

enough
for
me
to
consider
drinking
this
again
i¬íve
had
better
so
what¬Ö
it
is
good
at
the
moment
around

in

the
carbonation
is

low

workable
and
the
mouthfeel

i¬íd
drink
this

this

still

this
is
a

brew
it
is
quite
smooth
and
creamy
with
just
a
bit
of
astringency
in
the
finish
if
the
astringency
was
taken
care
of
this
would
be

through

but
with
the
acidness
that
you

coats

tongue

you
relly

this
at

gotta
wonder
if
im
drinking
the

beer
my
first

was

too

hopped
for
the
style
the
beer
looked
good
with

good

thats
just
about
right
for
an

brown

overall
very
well
done
and
enjoyable
i
cant
really
complain
about
this
one
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
like
the
sweetness
and
it
fits
to
be
a
winter
beer
i
would
give
this
another
try
pours
with
a
small
white

a
deep
copper

the
subtle
malt
taste
combines
well
with
the
sugar
and
wheat
giving
it
a
good
caramel
flavor
just
as
the
label
describes
cant
wait
until
next
christmas
season
to
get
my
hands
on
this
one
again
a
good
summer
beer
but
each
time
you
drink
it
it
becomes
more
ordinary
was
not
impressed
with
any
particular
aspect
of
this
beer
pales
in
comparison
to
other
seasonals
more
of
an
attempt
to
market
it
as
a
seasonal
as
opposed
to
being
one
soninlaw
spotted
a
twelve
of
this
for
birthday
party
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
twisting
off
the
top
i
get
a
waft
of
some
caramel
and
a
zesty
hint
of
spice
pours
to
a
nice
light
root
beer
color
with
a
tan
head
that
recedes
to
a
quarter
inch
then
holds
on
the
taste
this
brew
is
slightly
roasted
caramelly
flavor
with
a
tad
bit
of
bitters
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
not
outstanding
it
kind
of
has
a
funky
twang
in
the
aftertaste
that
is
niether
sweet
or
bitter
this
brew
is
drinkable
and
inoffensive
but
a
long
way
from
what
i
expect
in
a
brown
ale
sad
to
say
for
bmc
the
apple
never
falls
far
from
the
tree
as
they
cant
seem
to
go

please

theres

mom
i
dont
see
myself
picking
this
one
up
ever
again
it
should
work
just
fine
for
poker
swill
tonight
but
thats
the
extent
of
my
plans
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
amberbrown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
sweetness
taste
is
malty
sugar
a
bit
of
nuttiness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
and
decent
beer
this
poured
a
nice
coppery
orange
the
nose
was
malty
along
with
a
brown
sugar
syrupy
smell
no
hops
to
be
found
the
taste
however
was
very
thin
i
was
expecting
some
of
that
malty
sweetness
to
come
through
but
it
ended
very
quickly
i
thought
the
mouth
feel
was
a
bit
too
bubbly
almost
soft
drink
fizz
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
it
was
however
average
i
also
tasted
the
winter
abbey
ale
at
the
same
time
and
they
tasted
like
the
same
beer
had
a
hard
time
deciphering
any
difference
so
they
review
near
identical
this
was
purchased
in
an
oklahoma
grocery
store
so
it
had
to
be
a
4
0
abv
3
2
abw
version
would
like
to
try
it
at
a
full
5
6
abv
it
would
probably
have
more
warmth
and
character
or
then
again
it
might
be
worse
seeing
that
others
have
said
it
reminds
them
of
malt
liquor
a
little
nutty
flavor
saves
this
from
obscurity
but
its
not
something
id
try
again
still
its
acceptable
for
an
american
brown
ale
just
dont
believe
it
has
anything
to
do
with
an
abbey
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
emigration
market
in
salt
lake
o
not
bad
but
nothing
special
here
slightly
too
sweet
for
me
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
interesting
enough
to
get
again
nice
beer
for
christmas
eve
eve
overall
solid
middle
of
the
road
beer
it
was
simply
ok
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
but
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
tastes
like
brown
sugar
in
the
body
along
with
medium
roasted
malts
sweet
and
malty
what
a
great
winter
beer
i
really
love
the
look
and
taste
of
this
more
common
beer
wasnt
expecting
munch
blue
moon
is
a
beer
i
have
enjoyed
among
friends
not
a
go
to
beer
a
little
sweeter
than
regular
blue
moon
overall
not
quite
worth
the
8
50
but
not
a
terrible
brew
either
try
it
if
you
want
overall
wasnt
bad
but
wasnt
extrordinarily
good
either
it
was
simply
ok
if
i
were
to
be
offered
this
at
a
party
or
on
tap
id
take
it
maybe
but
i
wouldnt
regularly
seek
it
out
i
will
say
this
though
if
it
were
more
fine
tuned
it
could
be
a
little
more
than
ok
the
belgian
candy
sugar
takes
over
the
flavor
profile
in
short
it
tastes
like
sugar
overall
pretty
tasty
definitely
has
the
brown
ale
idea
would
like
it
better
at
a
lower
price
point
revisiting
the
beer
picked
up
a
case
on
sale
for
14
99
and
at
the
price
its
real
deal
a
nice
brown
ale
with
sweet
caramel
notes
has
a
best
before
date
of
515
and
it
will
gone
way
before
that
i
was
anxious
to
get
started
with
this
one
so
i
employed
a
heavy
hand
in
terms
of
the
pour
resulting
in
a
pretty
pseudocascade
this
settled
into
just
over
two
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
good
retention
copper
was
exactly
the
word
for
the
color
on
this
one
srm
17

the
clarity
was
buttonbright
and
i
was
getting
excited
to
try
it
nose
had
a
light
caramel
quality
which
was
disappointing
since
i
expected
more
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
flavor
was
definitely
caramel
but
still
kind
of
muted
given
their
verbiage
on
the
label
likewise
i
agreed
with
their
calling
the
finish
toffee
in
fact
i
would
say
that
the
overall
flavor
was
more
toffee
than
caramel
anyway
call
the
finish
semisweet
as
it
was
not
outright
sweet
and
just
about
as
much
as
this
hophead
can
tolerate
once
again
tis
would
be
much
more
apropriate
during
the
colder
months
but
cest
la
guerre
c
overall
this
is
not
what
i
expected
original
blue
moon
was
great
this
however
is
not
a
great
brew
its
simply
ok
the
sugar
content
takes
away
from
the
smell
and
taste
o
not
what
i
expected
from
anything
with
the
name
belgian
on
the
label
an
ok
beer
but
closer
to
a
michelob
amber
bock
than
anything
i
have
ever
had
labeled
belgian
overall
a
sweeter
but
still
rather
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
brew
overall
i
didnt
want
to
like
this
but
it
has
a
great
warming
taste
that
goes
perfectly
with
snowy
days
the
hops
and
sweetness
are
wellbalanced
good
if
you
are
only
having
one
i
brought
it
to
a
super
bowl
party
and
everyone
loved
it
blue
moon
really
brings
the
taste
in
their
fall
and
winter
offerings
overall
not
bad
just
boring
pours
a
dark
mahogany
in
color
with
a
1finger
of
a
offwhite
head
that
settled
down
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
and
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
the
semisweet
caramel
malts
coming
through
at
first
with
a
perfect
balance
of
a
hint
of
wheat
and
brown
sugar
as
well
perfect
carbonation
and
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
another
great
seasonal
from
the
blue
moon
folks
this
is
understated
and
overfiltered
for
the
style
but
not
bad
i
wasnt
really
expecting
a
superpremium
abbey
ale
clone
for
6
99
a
six
pack
anyhow
o
decent
but
too
mild
very
light
flavored
compared
to
the
abita
amber
sampled
after
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
much
going
on
besides
a
malty
sweetness
always
being
a
sucker
for
seasonals
from
blue
moon
i
thought
i
would
give
this
one
a
whirl
a
nice
amber
color
not
to
much
on
the
head
and
no
lacing
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
after
taste
that
reminds
me
more
of
apples
then
of
toffee
a
nice
solid
beer
if
offered
to
me
but
i
probbly
wouldnt
want
a
whole
case
of
it
didnt
pour
this
one
i
drank
ti
straight
from
the
bottle
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
caramel
and
spices
the
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
of
malts
caramel
brown
sugar
and
winter
spices
the
overall
mouth
feel
was
pleasant
although
was
a
little
more
carbonated
than
i
would
have
likedexpected
o
what
a
let
down
i
dont
mind
the
bmcs
trying
to
make
good
beers
but
id
rather
they
didnt
flood
the
market
with
such
subpar
offerings
this
is
basically
dirt
with
a
pretty
dress
put
on
it
this
comes
across
as
a
sort
of
belgian
dubbel
light
it
has
the
malt
and
candi
sugar
it
has
some
of
the
aroma
but
falls
short
in
appearance
flavor
complexity
and
body
a
decent
effort
i
had
tried
this
beer
last
new
years
eve
when
it
was
called
winter
abbey
ale
and
the
mouthfeel
and
smoothness
of
it
is
what
got
me
into
blue
moon
they
recently
changed
the
name
and
the
flavor
is
more
strong
and
rich
than
i
remember
i
could
taste
more
of
the
alcohol
and
carbonation
than
the
maltiness
thin
and
wellcarbonated
with
a
swift
kick
of
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
not
big
but
it
hardly
needs
to
be
any
bigger
than
what
it
actually
is
in
the
percentage
trifling
worse
than
the
farmhouse
red
ale
for
sure
blue
moons
mountain
abbey
ale
formerly
winter
abbey
ale
is
surprisingly
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
i
had
this
beer
two
years
ago
when
it
went
by
winter
but
now
that
they
changed
it
call
it
mountain
im
left
a
tiny
bit
disappointed
the
appearance
is
good
very
strong
and
dark
caramel
color
the
smell
is
truly
superb
you
can
sense
the
hints
of
toffee
and
roasted
malts
you
can
even
taste
them
distantly
but
theres
way
to
much
carbonation
taking
away
from
what
would
otherwise
be
a
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
its
good
but
nothing
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
a
while
ago
overall
i
prefer
this
one
over
the
blue
moon
gingerbread
ale
the
flavor
has
a
malt
presence
up
front
but
generally
clean
yeast
flavor
with
a
slight
woody
cinnamonlike
taste
with
gentle
herbal
note
w
moderate
caramel
in
the
malt
rounding
out
the
taste
overall
this
is
an
okay
take
on
the
style
not
exceptional
but
okay
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
ale
medium
brown
pour
with
an
open
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
no
lacing
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
traces
of
caramel
and
nut
a
bit
of
cracker
taste
follows
this
recipe
light
biscuit
caramel
and
a
hint
if
nuttiness
light
body
in
its
entirety
the
light
body
and
rather
nondescript
flavor
give
this
a
watery
quality
i
dont
know
what
part
if
this
is
abbey
its
drinkable
but
not
something
id
ever
seek
out
o
while
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
wont
have
any
trouble
finishing
the
six
pack
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
on
a
side
note
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
they
departed
from
their
usual
winter
abby
ale
dubble
which
i
always
felt
was
a
nice
light
version
of
an
abby
aleand
instead
went
to
this
brown
ale
as
their
current
2013
winter
style
lol
it
really
tastes
exactly
like
peanut
butter
and
jelly
and
toasted
bread
amazing
and
perfectly
crafted
so
good
very
impressive
effort
here
just
tried
a
bit
at
ebf15
but
clearly
a
legit
take
on
pbj
ale
sounded
off
to
me
at
first
but
its
actually
very
well
done
would
absolutely
seek
this
out
if
it
were
ever
available
in
maine
ebf
sample
have
wanted
to
try
this
beer
for
ages
finally
pours
a
clear
light
brownish
color
smells
of
peanut
butter
and
jelly
it
truly
does
simple
brown
malt
bill
sort
of
adds
backing
to
the
peanut
butter
and
sweetness
of
the
jelly
flavor
the
flavor
starts
off
with
some
malty
sweetness
and
then
it
turns
into
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich
liquified
in
my
mouth
finishes
with
a
really
neat
peanutty
finish
lighter
bodied
this
beer
is
wacky
how
do
they
do
this
without
using
all
this
artificial
flavoring
or
do
they
use
a
lot
of
artificial
flavoring
who
knows
and
sometimes
who
cares
not
a
fan
of
the
sour
taste
to
this
beer
had
this
on
tap
at
huna
day
not
sure
if
something
was
off
or
it
was
just
me
having
had
other
top
beers
but
this
was
disappointing
chewy
savory
entrance
with
a
sweet
jelly
finish
are
you
kidding
me
from
32
oz
growler
smelled
and
tasted
infected
ridiculous
beer
amazing
like
liquid
pbj
very
light
in
body
and
an
easy
drinking
beer
its
fun
but
not
a
great
beer
i
appreciated
the
experience
though
i
am
a
major
peanut
butter
freak
every
morning
for
breakfast
and
was
all
over
this
when
i
saw
it
has
more
of
the
jelly
than
the
peanut
butter
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
like
the
creaminess
of
it
but
the
body
could
have
been
fuller
to
better
showcase
the
flavors
interesting
mesh
but
once
again
lack
of
peanut
butter
makes
a
brew
less
than
what
it
is
advertised
as
o
overall
this
beer
blew
me
away
absurd
here
i
really
wanted
to
not
like
the
taste
after
smelling
how
good
it
was
just
because
this
beer
isnt
exactly
easy
to
get
but
my
goodness
the
base
is
basically
lost
a
brown
ale
so
one
really
cant
base
if
off
of
that
goodness
was
this
awesome
and
it
was
over
2
weeks
old
such
an
interesting
beer
ive
had
several
things
from
funky
buddha
and
im
looking
forward
to
my
first
sip
of
no
crusts
i
have
heard
fantastic
things
about
it
i
had
the
bonita
applebum
for
the
first
time
yesterday
and
i
was
blown
away
by
that
and
people
were
saying
its
great
but
its
no
no
crusts
o
a
very
odd
beer
and
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
much
better
than
the
shorts
take
on
it
as
everyone
ive
had
by
them
as
they
had
a
faint
plastic
note
to
them
pretty
well
executed
but
the
small
pour
i
had
was
enough
for
me
thanks
todd
o
good
beer
that
tastes
just
as
advertised
imagine
someone
spreading
grape
jelly
on
top
of
a
nutter
butter
and
you
get
this
beer
it
is
good
but
just
like
the
kuhnhenn
breakfast
beers
about
a
glass
of
this
is
enough
overall
id
drink
this
till
i
die
pours
a
murky
dark
honey
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
peanut
butter
jelly
and
bread
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
peanut
and
jelly
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
toasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
spot
on
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich
aroma
that
doesnt
exactly
translate
the
same
to
the
taste
never
tasted
a
beer
like
this
at
all
mind
blowing
overall
this
is
a
fine
american
brown
ale
with
delicious
flavors
and
a
distinct
aroma
that
cannot
be
matched
o
i
wouldnt
say
this
was
my
favorite
beer
ive
had
or
something
that
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
definitely
one
of
the
more
unique
and
enjoyable
ones
ive
experienced
i
think
the
execution
on
this
was
superb
and
they
nailed
the
peanut
butter
and
jelly
smelltaste
right
to
the
tee
the
best
comparison
i
could
make
with
this
is
with
jelly
belly
jelly
beans
it
amazing
how
they
can
make
it
taste
so
much
like
the
real
thing
i
wouldnt
say
this
beer
is
for
everyone
but
i
definitely
recommend
checking
it
out
especially
if
you
are
looking
for
a
unique
interesting
beer
or
you
just
like
pbj
sandwiches
on
tap
at
churchkey
served
in
a
mini
snifter
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
short
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
carries
some
peanut
butter
and
jelly
surprise
surprise
the
peanut
butter
component
takes
over
with
just
a
bit
of
berry
in
the
background
flavor
has
mild
fruit
and
more
peanut
a
bit
onedimensional
and
not
my
favorite
dimension
at
that
medium
body
with
a
semidry
finish
just
okay
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
balance
of
toasted
peanut
sweet
slightly
tart
jelly
and
fresh
bread
roasted
with
lots
of
peanut
flavor
up
front
along
with
slightly
smoked
malt
undertones
more
peanut
than
peanut
butter
but
it
still
replicates
the
flavor
pretty
well
this
is
followed
by
fresh
baked
bread
including
crust
and
a
really
prominent
sweet
tart
jam
presence
in
the
finish
the
jelly
portion
of
the
beer
is
really
overpowering
after
a
few
ounces
and
provides
a
lingering
unpleasant
aftertaste
the
subtle
roasted
malt
notes
were
the
only
element
that
made
it
taste
like
a
brown
ale
other
than
that
it
tastes
more
like
a
good
alcoholic
dessert
drink
than
a
beer
decent
but
nowhere
near
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
experimental
beers
peanuts
with
minimal
salt
compose
the
flavor
grape
jelly
is
an
afterthought
serving
as
an
accent
to
everything
else
going
on
here
quite
interesting
unique
and
enjoyable
cant
drink
more
than
a
few
oz
of
this
but
its
a
great
experience
in
a
glass
particularly
if
you
home
brew
the
beer
is
russet
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
head
the
aroma
is
shocking
and
hilarious
i
would
literally
think
one
was
holding
a
pbj
sandwich
under
my
nose
if
this
were
a
blind
test
very
impressive
the
flavor
follows
suit
i
wish
i
could
go
more
in
depth
but
this
is
a
straightforward
brew
it
smells
and
tastes
like
a
pbj
beer
light
to
medium
bodied
not
something
i
would
drink
in
quantity
but
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
if
you
have
the
opportunity
the
feel
is
slick
and
decent
in
body
overall
this
beer
is
good
in
small
doses
but
there
is
no
way
i
could
have
drank
more
than
the
taster
of
6oz
or
so
that
i
got
o
not
quite
the
stunner
i
was
expecting
theres
nothing
directly
wrong
with
the
nose
or
flavors
here
yet
this
isnt
as
expressive
as
i
would
have
liked
a
decent
gimmick
beer
no
more
beer
tastes
like
peanuts
salt
and
dirt
nope
not
loving
it
i
get
it
but
not
every
concept
makes
for
a
good
beer
too
much
peanut
too
much
salt
too
much
of
everything
there
is
already
a
shorts
brewing
company
out
there
making
horrible
beers
give
up
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
little
watery
with
low
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
cool
and
interesting
beer
it
tasted
exactly
like
peanuts
to
me
which
wasnt
bad
but
maybe
a
little
odd
it
was
nice
to
try
once
but
not
something
id
want
to
drink
often
an
interesting
beer
no
doubt
but
i
just
didnt
really
find
myself
digging
it
still
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
smell
on
this
beer
is
absolutely
phenomenal
as
pretty
much
everyone
has
said
it
smells
exactly
like
a
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich
in
an
incredible
way
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
impressive
and
i
wish
there
was
more
jelly
going
on
the
peanut
really
takes
over
the
flavor
and
mixes
nicely
with
the
bready
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
beer
earns
an
a
for
creativity
its
not
a
beer
id
want
to
drink
a
ton
of
but
a
4
oz
pour
was
perfect
honestly
if
it
had
more
grape
in
the
flavor
this
beer
might
be
amazing
instead
it
was
an
impressively
successful
experiment
dark
coppertinted
brown
full
fluffy
khaki
bubbles
decent
retention
as
advertised
leads
with
a
combination
of
fresh
roasted
and
ground
nuts
creamy
peanut
butter
notes
of
dark
berries
solid
but
not
as
in
force
as
the
nuttyness
with
a
bready
malt
backbone
taste
brings
a
more
balanced
combination
of
nuts
and
fruit
bready
malts
still
present
with
some
moderate
toast
charachter
medium
bodied
creamy
another
fantastic
foodcentric
brew
from
these
guys
no
crusts
looks
semi
black
but
is
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
small
amount
of
off
white
foam
on
top
leaving
small
splotches
here
and
there
a
brown
ale
indeed
smell
is
peanut
butter
and
jelly
a
lot
of
nuts
in
the
scent
with
some
jam
backing
small
hint
of
roast
with
malt
backing
taste
is
all
nuts
with
some
jellyjam
not
your
typical
brown
ale
but
the
base
is
not
totally
lost
feel
is
pretty
light
with
some
bubbles
but
not
super
carbed
up
i
could
go
for
a
pint
of
this
and
enjoy
every
drop
not
your
typical
flavor
from
a
simple
style
but
whats
advertised
is
delivered
so
i
deem
this
a
success
o
if
youre
looking
for
a
pbj
beer
this
will
do
it
for
you
its
a
nice
novelty
but
im
not
sure
i
could
really
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
oan
interesting
brown
ale
with
novel
flavors
but
wish
it
had
a
little
more
body
my
only
comparison
to
a
pbj
beer
is
from
spring
house
brewing
company
and
theyre
both
awesome
incarnations
of
the
classic
childhood
sandwich
an
absolute
must
try
if
you
get
the
chance
thanks
for
sending
the
awesome
beers
to
philly
guys
this
was
definitely
my
least
favorite
of
funky
buddhas
brews
still
good
but
my
least
favorite
o
a
nice
beer
but
out
of
the
four
offered
i
had
this
number
three
of
the
four
and
that
is
only
because
i
am
not
a
hop
person
so
the
ginger
ipa
ranks
fourth
by
default
a
great
event
today
thanks
matt
and
the
gang
frm
fb
please
come
back
again
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
thin
white
ring
oh
my
goodness
straightup
pbj
this
is
sick
earthy
peanuts
roasted
malt
baked
bread
and
grape
jelly
you
can
make
out
every
distinct
aromas
in
this
beer
wonkaesque
taste
is
similarly
impressive
and
once
again
you
can
taste
each
individual
component
somehow
roasted
peanuts
sweet
grape
jelly
toasted
bread
insane
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
sticky
with
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
handsdown
the
highlight
of
the
day
amazing
doesnt
even
begin
to
describe
it
i
want
more
overall
really
enjoyed
the
way
this
comes
together
in
the
finish
balancing
out
both
the
peanut
butter
and
jelly
elements
as
unusual
a
beer
as
you
will
find
medium
body
well
carbonated
a
little
sticky
on
the
tongue
this
was
another
whoa
are
they
serious
moments
for
me
at
the
funky
buddha
table
during
the
fest
such
an
awesome
beer
experience
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
every
day
but
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
that
tastes
like
peanut
butter
and
jelly
this
would
be
my
go
to
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
cool
beer
a
bit
of
a
gimmick
beer
but
it
works
well
and
was
one
of
the
cooler
beers
i
had
at
ebf
nose
really
smells
exactly
like
a
pb
sandwich
and
its
easy
to
drink
would
love
to
have
it
again
overall
very
nice
nice
jammy
preserve
mixed
berry
grape
thing
nice
bready
notes
nice
peanutbutter
although
i
wish
that
was
a
bit
more
on
top
of
a
great
base
beer
which
is
still
preserved
so
well
done
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
really
nice
looking
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
loaded
with
peanuts
butter
aromas
and
some
minimal
grains
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
just
out
of
this
world
really
i
cant
stress
the
fact
that
this
beer
tastes
like
a
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich
its
got
the
bread
its
the
pbj
to
the
fullest
level
it
possibly
can
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
overall
this
beer
is
just
great
its
something
that
you
need
to
experience
for
yourself
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
and
i
hope
that
one
day
ill
get
to
visit
fbl
to
have
more
o
amazing
never
had
another
brew
like
it
overall
the
beer
tastes
great
but
the
smell
is
out
of
this
world
a
really
interesting
beer
that
id
like
to
try
again
o
had
big
expectations
here
and
this
lived
up
to
the
hype
retained
a
beer
taste
but
still
had
a
great
pbj
taste
very
nice
offering
from
the
guys
at
the
buddha
this
is
what
i
imagine
shorts
was
aiming
for
when
they
brewed
pbj
if
they
could
ever
release
a
batch
that
wasnt
infected
maybe
i
could
confirm
that
on
tap
at
funky
buddha
this
beer
is
great
i
never
like
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwiches
and
still
do
not
like
them
however
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
like
them
lot
of
peanuts
and
jelly
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
just
how
wish
a
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwich
should
taste
like
keep
up
the
solid
work
funky
buddha
overall
the
flavor
is
good
but
the
aroma
is
unreal
i
couldnt
take
my
nose
out
of
the
glass
great
stuff
ogreat
beer
would
love
to
get
some
more
bottles
dark
brown
pour
just
menacing
looking
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
just
towered
over
the
top
of
the
glass
fading
slowly
it
left
behind
tons
of
side
glass
lacing
and
a
huge
amount
of
spider
like
webs
aroma
was
sweet
and
spicy
at
the
same
time
notes
of
rye
brown
sugar
molasses
like
touches
and
hints
of
coffee
are
all
coming
through
very
clearly
each
sip
now
seem
to
get
a
bit
more
complex
then
the
one
before
it
really
very
well
done
here
rich
chocolate
notes
blending
well
now
with
huge
malts
and
a
touch
of
rye
that
are
just
fantastic
light
suagry
finish
with
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
back
just
enough
to
push
it
over
the
edge
for
me
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
had
no
issues
at
all
with
polishing
this
one
off
o
really
interesting
and
not
at
all
bad
3
5
d
good
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
is
far
too
light
and
the
taste
is
lacking
power
overall
the
beer
i
am
drinking
is
just
not
that
good
i
would
love
to
try
a
keg
at
the
source
though
overy
good
nice
representation
of
the
name
overall
i
can
see
what
they
were
going
for
i
personally
didnt
like
it
too
much
but
i
applaud
them
for
their
creativity
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
and
see
what
all
the
hype
is
about
for
what
its
worth
i
thought
this
absolutely
crushed
shorts
uber
goober
the
incorporation
of
fruit
into
this
beer
is
masterful
and
though
this
could
have
easily
veered
off
into
novelty
territory
it
is
harmoniously
balanced
ryan
you
are
a
gentleman
and
just
as
important
an
alchemist
disappointing
given
how
amazing
maple
bacon
was
but
then
again
not
everything
can
be
a
hit
i
wanted
this
to
be
good
i
really
did
but
it
wasnt
it
was
easily
the
worst
beer
at
the
share
hopefully
the
other
funky
buddha
beers
are
worth
a
damn
not
that
i
would
trade
for
any
of
them
even
though
this
bottle
was
bad
i
am
rating
the
beer
as
i
had
it
if
i
get
another
in
the
future
i
will
rerate
it
so
for
now
this
is
one
awful
beer
served
in
a
chimay
glass
filled
to
the
brim
so
no
head
aroma
of
roasted
peanuts
is
prevalent
as
well
at
the
front
of
the
taste
when
you
swallow
it
switches
to
grape
jelly
pretty
unbelievable
actually
and
the
reason
behind
giving
it
a
5
for
taste
bc
it
does
what
it
says
the
flavors
are
so
right
on
mouthfeel
is
average
with
light
carbonation
this
is
a
fun
one
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
on
a
regular
basis
bc
i
want
a
beer
not
a
sweet
liquid
snack
o
smells
like
peanut
butter
and
tastes
like
jelly
good
for
what
it
is
but
its
still
a
gimmick
i
know
this
brewery
is
getting
a
lot
of
hype
right
now
i
hope
the
hype
carries
them
to
expansion
because
i
want
to
try
more
of
their
beer
this
beer
is
good
enough
to
be
a
fridge
staple
for
me
not
i
would
gladly
buy
this
again
but
i
would
make
a
serious
effort
not
to
be
without
it
this
in
my
fridge
on
tap
at
the
funky
buddha
murky
reddish
brown
pour
with
a
small
white
head
i
thought
the
mbcp
nose
was
incredible
but
the
no
crust
is
down
right
insane
total
freakin
chunky
roasted
peanut
butter
with
undercurrents
of
dried
berries
the
taste
is
so
cool
massive
peanut
butter
flavors
offset
by
mixed
berry
jam
apricots
and
blackberries
kudos
to
kevin
ryan
and
the
rest
of
the
buddha
crew
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
i
dont
know
but
from
their
other
offerings
i
have
tried
and
rated
this
was
a
huge
letdown
o
very
enjoyable
destroys
the
shorts
version
of
pbj
like
i
said
i
prefer
a
liquid
lunch
so
no
crust
works
for
me
a
musttry
if
youre
into
unique
beers
not
something
to
have
over
and
over
again
though
massive
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
beeruser
this
one
as
a
part
of
my
birthday
weekend
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
redbrown
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
peanut
butter
jelly
and
bread
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
peanut
butter
jelly
bread
and
subtle
fruit
it
had
a
mild
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
if
i
am
honest
this
thing
really
did
taste
and
smell
like
a
pbj
sandwich
almost
scary
how
close
it
was
the
peanut
butter
flavor
sticks
to
your
palate
well
after
you
sip
is
taken
almost
like
it
is
stuck
to
the
roof
of
your
mouth
no
a
lot
bad
can
be
said
about
this
beer
in
any
way
shape
or
form
really
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
d
its
a
gimmicky
but
an
excellent
one
much
better
than
shorts
pbj
or
uber
goober
im
curious
to
see
how
this
will
age
as
i
can
imagine
the
intense
peanut
aroma
fading
quickly
i
was
sad
about
how
fast
we
finished
the
bottle
and
wish
that
i
had
bottle
of
my
own
hopefully
funky
buddha
will
make
more
down
the
road
o
for
what
this
is
a
pbj
beer
its
fantastic
i
imagine
this
is
hard
to
pull
off
and
they
hit
a
winning
combination
unique
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
particularly
if
you
are
into
trying
unusual
beers
thanks
to
casey
or
this
bottle
nice
dark
brown
with
light
lacing
the
smell
is
as
described
peanut
butter
and
jelly
peanuts
is
stronger
than
the
jelly
which
is
more
hidden
taste
is
roasty
buttery
with
a
light
tropical
jelly
taste
lighter
mouthfeel
than
would
have
expected
but
still
good
overall
the
beer
delivers
as
expected
for
a
specialty
beer
would
gladly
drink
this
again
and
recommend
for
those
who
seek
the
unique
styles
thanks
to
casey
for
this
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
brown
decent
tan
head
the
nose
is
all
roasted
peanuts
salty
really
great
authentic
peanuts
the
jelly
is
hidden
dont
get
much
but
there
is
a
sweet
fruity
note
smells
great
the
first
is
all
roasted
salty
peanuts
its
awesome
after
that
the
taste
dies
down
a
bit
becomes
a
touch
watery
and
dead
on
the
finish
a
touch
of
alcohol
really
crushable
the
best
pbj
and
beer
ive
had
destroys
shorts
version
for
this
type
of
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
ones
out
there
this
beer
is
perfectly
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
all
in
all
this
is
a
treat
no
problems
polishing
off
the
bomber
and
i
would
drink
again
if
the
opportunity
arises
i
dont
feel
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
it
is
definitely
a
nice
treat
for
a
change
i
will
take
this
beer
over
a
pbj
sandwich
any
day
the
buddha
definitely
nailed
this
beer
spot
on
o
it
has
been
awhile
since
i
tasted
a
beer
that
floored
me
just
on
one
sip
alone
the
creativity
in
this
beer
is
amazing
and
i
wish
everyone
could
taste
this
just
once
nice
job
funky
buddha
overall
im
supremely
impressed
with
this
beer
as
a
homebrewer
ive
just
found
my
next
challenge
great
job
guys
deep
brown
body
with
mahogany
edges
and
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
quickly
turned
to
lace
the
aroma
exudes
peanut
butter
and
bready
sweetness
reminds
me
of
the
pbj
sandwiches
i
lived
off
of
in
middle
school
flavor
delivers
a
bold
peanut
butter
note
with
a
fruity
strawberrylike
finish
plenty
of
residual
peanut
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
but
the
flash
of
fruit
comes
through
nicely
sweet
underlying
toasted
grain
and
maybe
some
subtle
caramel
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
juicy
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
absolutely
spot
on
in
flavor
pbj
in
a
bottle
simple
and
not
as
cloying
as
i
thought
it
might
be
amazed
at
how
well
put
together
this
is
funky
buddha
does
it
again
i
missed
this
the
first
time
it
was
served
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
so
i
was
excited
to
have
a
second
opportunity
to
try
it
first
let
me
say
that
if
i
had
been
blindfolded
i
would
not
be
able
to
tell
this
beer
from
a
pbj
sandwich
based
on
smell
it
was
that
spoton
for
a
brown
ale
named
no
crusts

ill
write
a
little
more
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
beyond
belief
10
years
ago
of
what
i
thought
a
beer
could
be
go
to
a
store
that
has
the
machine
that
grinds
peanut
butter
in
front
of
you
and
stick
your
nose
as
close
as
you
can
to
it

friend
of
mine
told
me
that
there
was
a
beer
that
tasted
just
like
peanut
butter
and
jelly
part
of
me
thought
that
it
would
be
terrible
i
will
say
that
there
isnt
a
single
thing
i
would
change
about
this
beer

55545this
beer
is
just
redonkulous
people
were
telling
me
that
it
was
exactly
like
a
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwhich
d
o
nothing
remarkable
the
best
part
are
the
smells
when
drinking
everything
else
is
simply
average
i
didnt
get
the
pecan
nut
flavors
that
i
was
expecting
which
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
was
a
nervous
excited
to
try
this
knowing
i
dont
love
pecan
flavored
things
but
that
this
couldnt
possibly
taste
like
only
pecans
and
i
was
relieved
to
see
that
it
didnt
theres
enough
of
a
hint
to
know
its
a
strange
brew
of
sorts
but
plenty
of
your
typical
beer
ingredients
to
remind
you
this
is
just
a
fun
experiment
that
youd
want
to
drink
again

why
is
it
that
every
beer
brewed
with
nuts
taste
so
artificial
just
south
of
okay
kinda
thin
and
watery
and
green
tasting
this
year
lazy
magnolia
southern
pecan
is
way
tastier
i
would
not
seek
this
one
out
and
purchase
again
would
drink
again
if
available
though
just
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
there
are
better
options
mouthfee
is
thin
and
overall
a
ok
beer
lacking
flavor
and
body
pours
a
very
appetizing
amber
color
with
a
cream
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
earthy
with
almost
a
bit
of
salt
on
the
end
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
subdued
with
some
malt
and
hop
flavor
coming
through
but
not
nearly
as
much
pecan
as
i
expected
it
was
nice
but
i
just
wanted
more
earthy
nut
flavors
to
make
this
beer
really
stand
out
copper
bready
nose
and
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
the
addition
of
some
nutty
notes
not
getting
a
distinct
pecan
flavor
however
looks
like
a
bitter
tastes
like
a
brown
pours
a
brilliant
clear
orange
with
a
thin
layer
of
white
head
that
lingers
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
smell
has
a
nice
presence
of
pecans
im
actually
surprised
at
how
well
the
essence
of
pecans
are
contained
in
the
aroma
not
much
else
comes
through
on
the
nose
the
taste
unfortunately
does
not
feature
the
nice
nutty
nose
the
nose
has
instead
i
get
a
bland
and
fizzy
flavorless
liquid
almost
adjunct
lager
flavorless
this
is
disappointing
as
the
nose
is
quite
promising
up
front
i
get
watered
down
malt
this
is
followed
by
a
tinge
of
nuttiness
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
no
hops
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fizzy
overall
this
is
a
let
down
this
beer
surprised
me
i
was
fearing
itd
be
some
overlyflavored
concoction
kinda
like
many
flavored
coffees
it
wasnt
as
another
reviewer
noted
i
didnt
detect
much
if
any
nuttiness
in
it
but
it
poured
in
a
manner
my
unsophisticated
self
doesnt
have
words
for
a
fantastic
solidcloudy
color
i
dont
know
what
to
call
decent
ale
flavor
not
too
overboard
but
not
washed
out
like
some
seem
definitely
drinkable
and
refreshing
maybe
it
benefits
from
my
very
low
expectations
for
it
but
i
liked
it
well
enough
to
rate
it
higher
than
most
wont
seek
it
out
but
would
chose
it
over
some
other
stuff
if
given
choices
this
beer
is
not
spectacular
its
kind
of
a
one
note
wonder
i
dont
really
get
a
lot
of
the
pecan
in
there
i
detected
maybe
some
nuttiness
to
it
but
it
was
thick
and
sweet
and
that
is
about
all
you
get
its
a
nice
looking
beer
has
a
good
aroma
of
caramel
the
slightest
amount
of
nuttiness
i
assume
that
is
the
pecans
it
had
a
lot
of
head
that
really
never
tamed
down
i
was
interested
in
trying
this
one
i
have
seen
it
for
years
but
its
not
one
i
would
drink
regularly
its
too
sweet
for
my
taste
if
you
like
your
beers
to
taste
like
a
stuckeys
pecan
roll
then
go
for
it
o
easy
to
drink
and
definitely
a
beer
than
reminds
me
of
fall
it
is
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
of
what
i
would
prefer
slightly
fuller
body
and
just
a
touch
more
pecan
flavor
but
i
can
see
it
having
wider
appeal
because
of
that
not
bad
but
just
not
too
exciting
little
to
no
pecan
flavor
when
tasting
disappointing
a
brown
ale
the
doesnt
taste
like
a
brown
ale
or
look
like
a
brown
ale
i
wanted
this
to
be
wonderful
but
its
just
plain
nothing
to
write
home
about
very
light
weight
for
a
harvest
ale
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
great
aroma
but
not
as
good
in
flavor
good
malt
presence
but
a
bit
too
much
hops
bitterness
for
me
to
really
like
worth
a
try
once
though
for
malt
fans
and
im
sure
that
hop
heads
will
like
this
beer
overall
excellent
and
delicious
oa
bad
beer
i
wonder
why
i
keep
buying
abita
opretty
drinkable
brew
but
overall
flavor
is
a
bit
flat
overall
this
is
simply
the
best
abita
beer
ive
had
id
almost
given
up
on
them
but
i
like
this
one
a
lot
good
for
late
november
overall
an
enjoyable
and
simple
beer
it
was
in
the
single
area
and
i
gave
it
a
whirl
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
what
a
pecan
flavored
brown
ale
should
taste
like
the
smell
and
taste
is
of
smoky
roasted
walnuts
with
a
nice
malty
backbone
its
not
overly
sweet
but
is
well
balanced
and
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
nice
clean
finish
overall
a
great
fall
beer
option
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
this
is
by
far
the
best
fall
seasonal
beer
that
ive
ever
had
its
a
cross
between
a
nut
brown
ale
and
an
oktober
fest
when
i
first
saw
it
in
the
store
i
wasnt
sure
that
it
would
be
good
brewed
with
pecans
but
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
i
just
hope
that
start
to
make
it
year
round
tastefeel
quite
a
lot
like
the
smell
i
read
some
things
about
this
beer
before
having
it
and
its
what
i
expected
almost
exactly
the
pecan
and
caramel
is
there
from
beginning
to
end
and
thats
it
theres
no
other
dimension
of
flavor
theres
not
much
of
a
bitterness
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
its
very
very
onenote
carbonation
is
quite
high
and
the
feel
is
pretty
low
i
dont
love
it
but
this
is
actually
a
very
solid
sessionable
brew
if
youre
looking
for
something
to
send
your
taste
buds
on
a
ride
this
may
not
be
it
but
its
still
a
decent
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
the
pecans
showed
up
nicely
and
they
worked
well
with
the
malt
base
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
a
couple
of
these
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
its
name
it
was
it
was
just
as
advertised
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeeel
i
thought
it
was
a
little
thin
and
watery
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
as
a
nice
fall
time
beer
and
it
was
priced
nicely
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
nutty
beers
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
think
its
one
of
the
better
abita
beers
that
i
have
tried
so
far
this
is
a
pretty
nice
fall
time
beer
good
job
guys
o
overall
i
feel
that
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
i
will
be
looking
for
this
beer
again
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
is
that
it
has
a
light
nutty
flavor
without
being
artificial
tasting
or
over
the
top
like
pecan
pie
it
really
does
taste
like
a
pecan
bread
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
perfect
beer
but
it
is
outstanding
a
respectable
brown
just
not
one
id
buy
again
much
like
most
abita
products
overall
the
body
and
flavors
are
a
bit
weak
which
takes
the
brew
down
a
step
or
two
but
it
does
have
decent
but
very
light
flavor
with
some
nuttiness
an
alright
brew
but
nothing
special
with
notes
of
caramel
and
pecans
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
as
i
drink
it
i
imagine
the
pecans
being
added
in
the
brewing
process
as
i
taste
them
this
is
a
great
beer
that
will
have
your
mouth
wanting
another
abita
has
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
beer
and
i
wish
they
sold
it
here
in
wilson
nc
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
but
it
also
did
not
exceed
my
expectations
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
clean
finish
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
and
would
have
liked
to
try
it
on
tap
overall
i
would
recommend
it
to
others
wanting
something
different
but
abita
does
have
better
options
based
on
the
aroma
i
thought
this
one
was
gonna
turn
out
better
but
the
flavor
was
just
so
vapid
and
mindnumbingly
underwhelming
the
sad
thing
is
the
flavors
wereare
actually
pretty
decent
but
they
unfortunately
become
an
afterthought
to
the
watereddown
nature
of
this
american
brown
ale
started

fairly
hazy

color
with

colored

with

retention
that

to
a
small

for

a

on
flavor
but
very
pleasant
with
no
cloying

after
the

medium
carbonation

with
a
slightly
creamy
and
very
smooth
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
amber
ale
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
this
is
an
average
beer
fell
kinda
short
in
the
mouthfeel
though
poured
this
american
brown
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
brownred
color
the
pour
produced
a
small
tan
head
retention
was
poor
and
produced
only
a
light
amount
of
lace
the
aroma
consisted
of
roasted
malts
and
caramel
light
in
body
there
was
a
foundation
of
roasted
malt
and
nuttiness
overall
this
is
very
average
one
of
abita
better
tasting
brews
o
readily
recommended
as
a
budget
nut
ale
excellent
with
guacamole
and
should
be
great
with
cheese
this
beer
pours
up
a
gorgeous
beautiful
crystal
clear
copper
with
one
finger
of
off
white
head
not
much
retention
and
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
fairly
strong
but
one
dmensional
i
mostly
detect
notes
of
pine
taste
is
an
initial
small
amount
of
sweet
malt
follwed
by
a
bigger
amount
of
pecan
flavor
mouthfeel
is
average
with
a
mild
but
not
unpleasant
aftertaste
pass
on
this
one
unless
it
is
free
overall
slightly
dissapointed
by
this
one
been
looking
for
it
for
a
while
not
bad
just
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
light
bodied
with
below
average
carbonation
simply
not
a
good
beer
i
will
avoid
this
in
the
future
o
a
decent
seasonal
sweet
and
malty
but
i
found
myself
looking
for
more
pecans
they
were
there
but
just
a
trace
overall
a
disappointment
it
intrigued
me
enough
to
buy
it
with
hopes
of
a
nutty
andor
sweet
ping
to
it
neither
was
there
a
good
beer
for
summer
maybe
easy
drinking
but
not
much
to
it
overall
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
assertive
brew
but
with
abita
i
should
have
known
better
the
flavor
thats
there
isnt
half
bad
but
it
feels
like
half
a
flavor
wont
buy
again
there
are
plenty
of
better
browns
with
more
to
offer
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
i
like
this
beer
not
too
many
brewers
use
straight
up
nuts
that
i
am
aware
of
and
this
beer
features
the
pecan
pretty
well
the
pours
is
that
of
an
english
brown
ale
caramel
brown
not
too
dark
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
an
inch
or
so
tall
the
nose
is
real
woody
not
like
oak
but
like
a
two
by
four
really
some
sweeter
malts
with
a
good
toast
on
them
as
well
as
a
touch
of
sweetness
also
add
to
the
aroma
flavor
matches
well
with
the
smell
its
really
dense
and
woody
tasting
with
the
nuts
obviously
contributing
more
meat
than
sweet
here
a
little
sugary
in
the
finish
but
hardly
offensive
the
mouthfeel
works
bigger
body
but
it
remains
pretty
easy
drinking
with
its
vibrant
carbonation
and
smooth
finish
i
put
a
6er
of
these
down
pretty
quick
and
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
is
up
for
something
a
little
different
o
kind
of
reminds
me
of
turbodog
light
easy
to
drink
but
not
enjoyable
unless
in
a
party
setting
where
the
flavor
of
the
drink
takes
a
backseat
to
the
social
aspect
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
large
white
head
color
really
reminds
me
of
roasted
pecans
and
fall
aroma
is
fairly
mild
theres
a
slight
nutty
and
malty
sweetness
to
it
as
well
as
a
slight
earthy
note
taste
was
pretty
mild
as
well
earthy
with
a
little
roasted
character
i
think
maybe
i
get
a
little
nutty
pecan
flavor
maybe
im
just
imagining
it
fairly
highly
carbonated
and
a
medium
body
its
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
beer
mouthfeel
is
rather
oily
it
feels
like
my
mouth
is
being
coated
in
oil
with
every
sip
not
very
pleasant
overall
i
was
really
disappointed
with
this
beer
it
looked
so
promising
from
the
poor
but
it
just
went
downhill
from
there
nothing
spectacular
about
this
one
and
the
oily
characteristics
just
dont
work
for
me
i
wont
be
having
this
beer
again
i
decided
to
try
this
because
i
like
turbodog
and
southern
pecan
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
all
around
this
beer
is
pretty
mild
in
the
nose
i
get
a
slight
hint
of
a
sweet
caramel
flavor
and
a
hint
of
the
nuts
in
the
flavor
i
think
it
is
basically
a
less
complex
and
milder
form
of
turbodog
though
similar
but
i
get
a
little
more
from
the
nut
flavor
it
also
pours
a
lot
lighter
color
light
brown
than
most
brown
ales
especially
english
brown
ales
like
turbodog
but
is
very
drinkable
this
beer
still
has
a
lot
of
flavor
though
and
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
would
say
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
not
a
whole
lot
to
this
beer
the
scent
of
pecan
is
there
and
there
are
flashes
of
it
in
the
taste
but
that
really
is
about
all
the
beer
does
look
nice
however
pouring
a
golden
orange
with
a
nice
head
but
as
far
as
the
other
components
i
was
disappointing
it
really
is
too
bad
because
the
pecan
flavor
itself
does
taste
nice
and
fresh
but
it
needs
to
be
paired
with
something
to
make
this
beer
shine
whether
it
be
cinnamon
chocolate
or
roasted
malts
anything
would
have
really
enhanced
the
flavoring
but
this
was
not
the
case
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
the
beer
appears
to
be
wellcarbonated
the
head
retains
very
well
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
the
pecan
aroma
comes
through
in
the
smell
adding
a
complementary
subtle
nuttiness
to
the
sweet
and
bready
malts
theres
an
earthy
aroma
present
as
well
which
is
a
product
of
the
willamette
hops
the
flavor
is
of
nutty
pecan
with
the
roasted
malts
up
front
theres
some
mild
sweetness
in
there
from
the
caramel
malt
and
some
back
end
hop
bitterness
the
hops
bring
some
of
those
earthy
flavors
i
picked
up
in
the
nose
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
strong
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
with
high
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
beer
this
beer
is
a
honeyamber
colored
clear
liquid
the
head
is
modest
but
leaves
an
enticing
lace
its
aroma
is
enticing
nutty
sweet
slightly
malty
a
little
toasted
bread
some
caramel
and
honey
the
flavor
is
balanced
but
not
really
dovetailed
with
the
smell
a
little
oily
some
pale
and
toasted
malt
taste
not
really
sweet
but
no
serious
bitterness
either
nut
flavor
is
present
especially
in
the
hindtaste
medium
trending
light
in
body
it
could
be
more
full
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
still
i
imagine
that
this
is
a
difficult
beer
to
craft
and
it
is
nonetheless
very
well
done
rjt
o
could
have
been
nuttier
and
more
complex
but
this
was
overall
very
tasty
and
drinkable
and
i
think
it
would
pair
well
with
a
bunch
of
foods
and
baked
goods
that
i
like
smoked
meats
maple
foods
pancakesbreakfast
foods
shoofly
pie
not
a
bad
breakfast
beer
o
i
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
from
this
beer
given
the
average
scores
but
i
am
a
fan
of
brewing
brown
ales
with
nuts
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
however
abita
really
needed
to
step
up
the
malt
bill
and
nut
profile
on
this
beer
i
will
have
great
nut
brown
someday
but
not
this
day
o
a
very
good
sessionable
pecan
ale
this
beer
gets
a
bad
rap
for
some
reason
i
cannot
identify
id
drink
it
by
the
liter
in
fact
i
think
i
will
overall
pretty
good
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
like
a
little
more
pecan
flavor
other
than
just
a
nutty
taste
i
think
with
a
little
tweaking
this
would
be
a
great
beer
overall
this
was
good
and
worth
a
try
wouldnt
get
just
for
pecan
flavor
but
good
for
what
it
is
overall
3
0
just
ok
nothing
spectacular
i
honestly
did
not
taste
anything
that
reminded
me
of
pecans
i
think
that
if
the
brewmasters
at
abita
tinkered
with
this
one
a
bit
say
by
letting
it
age
in
bourbon
barrels
or
some
such
they
would
really
have
a
winner
on
their
hands
as
it
is
this
brew
is
not
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
o
a
disappointment
lacking
in
flavor
and
complexity
should
be
so
much
more
this
is
a
smooth
sessionable
beer
with
a
decent
flavor
profile
its
nutty
and
malty
without
being
too
much
its
worth
a
try
the
brew
poured
with
a
half
a
finger
of
white
head
on
a
clear
mahogany
body
with
moderate
visible
carbonation
the
nose
has
definite
notes
of
pecan
nuttiness
with
a
hint
of
almost
maple
sweetness
it
smelled
really
good
the
taste
was
not
quite
as
good
as
the
nose
the
taste
had
a
lot
of
the
nuttiness
that
was
apparent
in
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
the
body
was
a
little
watery
and
there
was
very
low
carbonation
on
the
taste
the
finish
was
quick
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
honestly
this
is
my
least
favorite
abita
beer
so
far
it
was
a
little
too
watery
and
boring
for
me
i
wouldnt
have
this
one
again
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
toasted
nuts
and
some
slight
caramel
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
but
there
are
more
burnt
flavors
than
toasted
flavors
there
is
a
mild
burnt
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
with
a
promising
nose
but
a
somewhat
disappointing
flavor
o
darn
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
out
but
it
just
was
unbelievably
lackadaisical
i
could
see
this
being
a
keystone
beer
if
they
went
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
actually
did
to
the
beer
what
the
label
says
i
had
no
idea
pecans
were
a
major
thing
in
louisiana
shows
what
i
know
about
american
agriculture
these
days
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
auburn
topped
by
a
finger
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
biscuit
light
honey
light
toffee
and
a
vague
sense
of
nuttiness
i
cant
say
with
any
certainty
that
im
smelling
pecans
but
its
definitely
some
sort
of
nut
anyway
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugarcinnamon
unfortunately
everything
is
now
watereddown
slightly
blander
than
before
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
little
beer
nothing
special
but
something
i
could
see
drinking
again
overall
it
has
a
nice
odor
but
taste
is
really
just
average
o
i
was
exited
to
try
a
pecan
beer
but
this
was
not
well
executed
overall
id
say
for
me
this
is
a
one
time
buy
im
glad
i
got
to
experience
it
since
it
is
quite
different
but
it
isnt
giving
me
that
wow
sense
that
i
get
with
other
beers
that
try
different
things
o
overall
this
one
misses
not
solid
enough
on
the
pure
beer
side
of
things
and
the
pecan
doesnt
really
add
much
for
interesting
character
doesnt
really
match
the
text
on
the
label
overall
i
seem
to
remember
enjoying
this
beer
more
in
the
past
but
this
is
not
a
total
letdown
by
any
means
o
pregame
warm
up
beer
overall
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
to
me
the
mouthfeel
resembles
a
fermented
cider
the
color
is
beautiful
however
and
the
smell
reminds
me
of
fall
this
was
interesting
to
try
but
i
wont
be
having
it
again
obetter
then
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
pecans
but
it
compliments
the
beer
quite
nice
would
have
like
the
malt
to
be
more
of
a
player
in
the
flavor
all
in
all
a
good
beer
session
beer
though
o
after
taking
a
whiff
i
thought
this
would
be
a
great
beer
after
i
drank
it
i
was
left
a
little
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
flavor
i
think
it
could
be
a
great
beer
with
some
bigger
flavor
pours
out
a
light
amberorange
color
with
minimal
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
few
white
lingering
bubbles
nutty
aroma
with
lots
of
caramel
hay
and
oats
seem
to
scream
out
at
me
taste
is
nutty
with
burnt
pecan
and
pecan
shell
bitterness
slight
malt
and
caramel
sweetness
that
is
barely
noticeable
some
citrus
notes
make
their
way
out
towards
the
finish
very
mild
hop
presence
throughout
the
sip
mouthfeel
is
light
but
refreshing
and
smooth
with
average
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
too
complex
but
an
interesting
addition
with
the
pecans
that
made
for
an
enjoyable
brew
m
not
huge
fan
of
pecans
in
general
but
i
had
to
try
it
in
general
it
was
solid
but
unexciting
no
real
noticeable
flavors
the
pecan
was
there
and
not
overwhelming
which
is
always
a
plus
in
flavored
beers
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
woulndt
get
it
again
abita
always
has
good
beers
but
this
was
not
their
best
i
have
to
give
it
up
to
abita
this
is
a
very
surprisingly
good
beer
when
the
bottle
is
opened
you
immediately
smell
the
pecans
and
thats
a
good
thing
the
beer
pours
a
brownish
color
with
minimal
head
and
lace
just
the
right
amount
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
a
nice
aftertaste
on
your
pallette
the
strength
of
this
beer
is
definitely
the
uniqueness
and
goes
down
as
more
than
a
novelty
beer
this
is
a
worthy
beer
by
any
means
overall
i
do
like
this
one
it
does
lack
refinement
here
and
there
but
it
does
its
purpose
the
touted
real
pecan
flavor
really
does
come
through
minimal
hopping
and
a
seemingly
bland
amber
malt
profile
do
provide
a
good
backdrop
for
flavor
a
good
seasonal
i
noticed
that
many
reviewers
reported
a
cloudy
pour
with
little
pecan
flavor
i
wonder
if
it
is
a
matter
of
freshness
picture
a
pecan
oktoberfest
and
youve
got
it
needs
some
backing
flavors
like
maybe
pecan
pie
spices
o
this
was
just
okay
i
think
it
would
be
better
with
some
pielike
spices
overall
not
particularly
bad
but
does
through
as
being
light
and
not
particularly
tasty
really
not
a
very
good
beer
too
bad
because
their
purple
haze
rocks
o
this
is
my
favorite
offering
from
abita
that
i
have
had
really
drinkable
beer
that
is
great
for
the
fall
one
of
the
sweetest
and
most
sugary
beers
i
have
ever
had
notes
this
my
first
offering
from
abita
i
thought
the
beer
would
be
good
which
it
was
its
not
bad
but
decently
drinkable
cheers
overall
a
balanced
brew
which
is
very
subtle
i
smelled
a
lot
of
pecan
but
it
didnt
transfer
over
to
the
taste
still
a
good
brew
to
drink
and
enjoy
cheers
o
a
good
different
brew
for
sure
would
definitely
drink
more
o
ive
had
this
before
and
dont
recall
liking
it
this
much
ill
have
to
pick
up
more
as
i
bought
this
as
a
single
but
it
would
be
a
great
beer
to
sip
a
couple
watching
football
on
a
crisp
fall
saturday
o
a
great
fall
sessionish
beer
for
the
price
its
great
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
choose
if
you
like
nutty
beers
or
just
want
something
tasty
to
sip
on
while
sitting
on
the
porch
on
a
fall
day
or
after
a
hot
day
in
the
sun
even
would
go
great
with
some
pecan
crusted
fish
and
rice
o
this
was
kind
of
a
let
down
yet
it
is
very
easy
drinking
and
very
sessionable
flavors
are
extremely
light
and
watery
but
what
is
there
is
very
pleasant
tasting
o
i
like
the
pecan
harvest
but
its
not
without
its
flaws
it
doesnt
have
a
particularly
strong
smell
and
the
mouthfeel
is
off
its
a
too
thin
which
is
disappointing
because
i
would
love
the
pecan
and
caramel
flavors
of
this
beer
to
linger
i
would
drink
again
but
it
doesnt
live
up
to
its
potential
not
bad
but
also
didnt
blow
me
away
smooth
and
easy
drinking
fall
brew
a
bit
to
light
though
id
buy
it
again
pair
this
with
turtle
dessert
or
possibly
a
pot
roast
with
mashed
potatoes
and
turnips
and
i
could
see
this
shining
a
bit
more
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clean
seethrough
brown
hue
with
a
thin
wispy
head
the
smell
is
pretty
nondescript
was
hoping
for
a
nutty
introduction
to
the
first
sip
alas
none
to
be
had
the
taste
too
fails
to
deliver
on
any
distinguishable
pecan
flavor
its
a
little
sweet
with
some
some
caramel
and
vanilla
noteswith
a
decent
helping
of
maltiness
this
is
a
nice
light
refreshing
beer
i
gotta
say
that
it
goes
down
real
easy
the
mouthfeel
is
real
thin
and
leaves
very
little
behind
except
a
tinge
of
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
dont
know
if
its
something
id
crave
or
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
again
more
a
product
of
constantly
wanting
to
try
new
things
but
if
it
was
offered
id
certainly
drink
it
without
a
fuss
mouthfeel
was
middling
and
slightly
under
carbonated
in
my
opinion
as
i
said
a
fairly
solid
brown
ale
but
there
are
better
varieties
available
you
could
probably
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
row
and
really
enjoy
yourself
that
said
none
of
them
is
gonna
blow
you
away
and
you
wont
hurry
out
to
get
this
again
still
ive
been
parceling
out
this
sixer
over
the
last
week
and
have
enjoyed
each
one
overall
not
impressed
no
roast
no
chocolate
not
an
american
brown
o
interesting
beer
flavorful
drinkable
and
balanced
ive
only
had
a
couple
beers
from
abita
but
theyve
all
been
pretty
good
and
the
pecan
harvest
ale
is
right
in
there
the
color
of
this
beer
is
a
nice
golden
brown
with
a
slight
cloudiness
the
smell
is
caramel
with
a
little
earthiness
and
malt
the
taste
is
caramel
bitterness
with
earthy
and
nut
flavors
there
is
a
woodiness
here
that
makes
for
an
interesting
brew
over
all
this
is
a
pretty
unique
little
beer
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
when
i
bought
this
and
it
surprised
me
i
kinda
thought
it
was
gonna
be
sweet
more
like
pecan
pie
but
it
has
a
more
earthy
nutty
taste
and
it
works
that
way
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
it
have
a
great
body
and
feel
when
you
drink
it
id
have
to
say
that
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
it
will
make
many
people
happy
but
not
for
me
aramel
color
brown
with
just
enough
light
getting
through
to
give
it
a
sort
of
off
reddish
tint
the
smallish
tan
head
quickly
faded
and
left
behind
only
traces
of
itself
the
aroma
itself
was
lightly
smoked
almost
full
of
roasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
flavor
was
light
bodied
but
nicely
roasted
with
a
touch
of
a
bittering
finish
and
a
flavor
full
of
earthy
grain
like
tones
a
nice
subtle
bread
like
base
was
quaintly
masked
underneath
overall
this
was
a
decent
brown
ale
it
was
nothing
spectacular
but
i
do
not
think
it
was
designed
to
be
but
rather
it
was
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
o
not
bad
but
not
great
either
middle
of
the
class
worth
a
shot
for
sure
would
have
loved
a
bit
nuttier
taste
to
it
this
one
pours
a
bright
and
vibrant
cloudy
amber
in
color
with
a
light
white
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aromas
are
very
malty
slightly
sweet
with
a
light
and
oily
nutty
essence
still
for
a
pecan
ale
it
isnt
very
nutty
it
tastes
of
sweet
malts
perhaps
some
brown
sugar
or
cinnamon
oily
pecans
and
has
a
light
and
bitter
finish
while
drinking
you
actually
eventually
get
more
of
a
pecan
pie
type
aftertaste
which
is
interesting
its
solid
the
beer
drinks
pretty
light
and
leaves
some
nice
flavors
behind
its
a
very
sessionable
beer
and
is
interesting
enough
to
drink
a
couple
of
them
in
a
sitting
solid
beer
but
at
least
different
for
a
amberbrown
ale
whichever
this
one
is
considered
o
i
would
call
this
a
nut
brown
tasting
amber
ale
but
not
a
brown
ale
amber
in
color
and
mouthfeel
pours
a
copper
burnt
orange
color
with
a
filmy
off
white
head
the
smell
is
mainly
toasted
pecan
with
some
roasted
malt
aroma
as
well
there
is
also
some
butter
and
caramel
in
there
it
tastes
a
little
lighter
than
the
aroma
i
tastes
some
buttered
pecan
and
toasted
malt
its
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
finish
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
i
thought
the
addition
of
pecan
went
really
well
overall
blah
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
body
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
very
enticing
aromas
of
candied
pecans
and
toasted
malts
are
extremely
inviting
flavors
are
also
good
but
lack
the
depth
necessary
to
score
a
4
in
my
book
toasted
malts
dominate
the
front
and
midpalate
with
hints
of
pecan
coming
through
but
not
as
prominently
as
on
the
nose
the
finish
is
a
bit
hollow
with
nothing
interesting
either
developing
or
lingering
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
one
that
id
happily
recommend
to
friends
willing
to
try
new
things
but
not
to
serious
beer
geeks
o
not
bad
had
hoped
for
more
of
the
pecan
presence
o
back
to
the
drawing
board
with
this
one
good
pecan
beers
can
be
done
but
this
isnt
a
good
example
at
all
very
light
hops
and
malts
typical
of
a
standard
ale
think
of
a
slightly
more
flavorful
version
of
a
bud
abita
however
has
infused
this
brew
with
the
natural
oils
that
come
from
pecans
and
this
extra
layer
gives
the
beer
a
nice
very
subtle
nutty
flavor
its
by
no
means
overpowering
in
fact
if
you
didnt
know
the
pecan
layer
was
there
you
probably
wouldnt
be
able
to
pick
it
out
but
it
does
add
an
allure
that
the
ale
would
otherwise
lack
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
toffee
and
bread
malt
i
get
a
little
bit
of
nuttyness
in
the
aroma
but
there
is
nothing
that
screams
pecans
the
flavor
features
some
light
pecan
notes
as
well
as
some
toffee
malt
the
beer
is
fairly
dry
overall
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
its
an
excuse
me
subtle
brew
but
flavorful
none
the
less
and
well
done
i
would
buy
again
when
i
was
in
a
similar
midsummer
refreshing
mood
lkike
i
am
today
its
an
enjoyable
amber
colored
ale
with
substantial
notes
of
pecans
in
the
nose
and
throughout
the
taste
the
hearty
pecan
presence
is
balanced
by
caramel
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
at
an
abv
of
only
5
its
quite
easy
to
drink
and
recommended
to
anyone
looking
for
a
flavorful
session
beer
this
poured
out
as
a
very
light
brown
color
it
had
a
thin
white
head
on
it
that
didnt
last
very
long
there
wasnt
much
lacing
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
faint
nutty
aroma
with
some
caramel
malts
backing
it
up
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
rather
bland
i
cant
seem
to
get
much
of
the
nut
flavors
from
this
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
only
decent
thing
about
this
beer
overall
not
impressed
really
i
expected
more
for
some
reason
o
okay
version
of
a
nut
brown
ale
not
a
huge
fan
and
will
probably
not
return
nice
attempt
but
i
still
am
yet
to
find
a
nut
brown
ale
that
impresses
mouthfeel
is
almost
waterlike
nothing
like
a
beer
should
be
pours
an
iced
tea
orangebrown
color
virtually
no
head
the
smell
is
straightforward
sweet
malty
with
a
touch
of
nut
initially
strikes
the
palate
as
very
malty
and
sweet
with
a
moderate
mouthfeel
mediumhigh
carbonation
but
a
disappointingly
thin
body
theres
a
simple
sugary
sweetness
throughout
resembling
honey
at
times
a
subtle
herbal
taste
lends
a
bit
of
complexity
on
the
front
end
but
the
beer
shines
when
the
nutty
pecan
character
develops
toward
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
in
the
aftertaste
overall
the
beer
could
use
more
complexity
but
delivers
on
the
pecan
beer
concept
well
enough
surprisingly
refreshing
too
drinks
less
than
average
drinkable
but
not
something
id
seek
out
d
this
beer
was
drinkable
but
not
enjoyable
a
good
malt
bomb
i
suppose
but
only
if
you
like
the
sweet
caramel
malts
just
rushing
at
you
i
would
like
to
see
more
pecans
or
nutty
flavor
to
this
beer
and
i
think
it
would
work
out
nice
a
overall
drain
pour
if
i
hadnt
have
split
it
with
a
friend
d
one
and
done
very
light
for
a
brown
ale
and
little
to
no
nut
flavor
this
one
challenged
my
taste
buds
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
dimpled
mug
poured
a
pretty
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
it
seems
to
have
pretty
low
carbonation
it
smells
wonderfulvery
nutty
and
a
little
fruity
it
feels
mediumbodied
and
its
flavor
is
just
as
wonderful
at
the
smell
you
can
really
taste
the
pecan
and
it
finishes
very
smoothly
this
brew
really
offers
an
enjoyable
experienceill
definitely
buy
this
one
again
and
i
highly
recommend
other
to
try
it
average
alcohol
and
no
offensive
flavors
not
a
great
beer
not
a
bad
beer
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
because
the
flavor
isnt
interesting
enough
to
hold
my
attention
i
dont
think
this
beer
should
be
categorized
as
a
brown
ale
though
due
to
the
color
and
lack
of
any
roasted
smells
o
flavors
i
had
to
rate
this
beer
on
what
i
though
about
it
overall
not
within
a
style
guideline
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
very
appetizing
copperygolden
amber
with
a
decent
pale
tan
head
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
a
definite
nutty
undertone
must
be
the
pecan
flavor
is
mainly
malty
with
a
nutty
undertone
and
just
a
hint
of
molasses
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
quite
tingly
leaving
behind
a
decent
and
persistent
fizz
thanks
nic
for
bringing
a
bottle
of
this
one
over
that
night
poured
a
medium
orange
color
with
a
smallish
cap
of
offwhite
foam
aromas
of
pecans
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
powder
light
to
medium
bodied
the
palate
follows
the
nose
with
bready
malt
caramel
and
pecans
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
overly
nutty
as
the
name
leads
one
to
think
nicely
balanced
but
nothing
that
stands
out
this
is
a
beer
you
wouldnt
turn
down
but
i
wont
be
buying
anymore
drinkability
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
not
bad
the
smell
was
a
bit
disturbing
to
me
the
taste
was
predominantly
bland
i
doubt
i
pick
this
up
again
i
went
in
thinking
this
brew
was
going
to
one
thing
but
it
turns
out
to
be
another
m
light
bodied
imperceptible
abv
good
co2
pleasant
drinkability
m
light
body
with
a
very
slight
chew
lightly
carbonated
this
is
a
decent
brew
a
very
unique
beer
that
im
glad
to
have
tried
but
not
something
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
again
unless
im
in
the
mood
for
pecans
in
beer
form
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
this
was
the
first
beer
i
have
had
brewed
with
nuts
dm
crisp
light
and
flavorful
with
a
good
carbonation
poured
a
goldish
brown
body
with
decent
head
that
died
quick
a
minor
hoppy
aroma
with
minor
sweet
malts
but
not
as
malty
as
expected
has
a
bit
of
yeasty
sweetness
but
is
more
or
less
bland
and
dry
and
there
is
minor
hopping
taste
on
the
backend
just
a
vanillatype
beer
for
the
masses
that
i
tried
and
i
can
live
wo
trying
it
again
on
a
side
note
bm
me
if
you
have
an
abita
beer
you
thinkll
blow
my
socks
off
please
d
if
you
like
the
pecan
flavor
this
one
will
be
very
easy
to
drink
for
you
d
great
at
5
abv
could
easily
have
a
few
good
thing
i
have
the
rest
of
a
sixer
in
the
fridge
its
a
solid
brew
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
brown
as
i
definitely
like
mine
a
bit
heavier
id
still
get
it
again
though
probably
d
goes
down
easy
sessionable
for
certain
simple
nice
easy
drinking
flavor
and
nothing
inhibits
that
upon
pouring
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
brown
color
and
is
topped
with
a
good
offwhite
colored
head
that
turns
to
a
light
lacing
throughout
drinking
it
on
the
nose
you
get
a
nice
clean
nutty
pecan
aroma
that
also
come
through
in
the
taste
as
well
as
the
nuttiness
of
the
pecan
you
get
yeasts
and
crisp
acid
that
would
stand
up
well
to
some
down
home
creole
or
cajun
cookin
and
would
probably
lend
its
self
very
well
to
anything
made
with
a
blackasnight
creole
roux
and
a
dash
of
spice
like
a
flavorful
gumbo
or
etouffee
this
brew
is
perfectly
balanced
enough
sweet
enough
bitter
with
just
the
right
about
of
nuttiness
and
great
carbonation
boasting
a
medium
body
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
whole
few
six
packs
of
these
when
they
come
out
next
year
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
i
found
it
to
be
quite
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
the
pecans
seem
to
add
a
nice
toasted
and
nutty
quality
without
the
need
of
darker
malts
that
would
also
add
roasted
and
chocolate
notes
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
and
a
nice
fall
offering
a
decent
light
bodied
easy
drinking
nut
brown
ale
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
i
prefer
heartier
nut
browns
like
goose
island
mild
winter
o
good
beer
probably
best
for
a
warm
fall
day
not
one
that
will
warm
you
on
those
colder
fall
days
as
the
leaves
are
falling
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
orange
color
its
slightly
off
brown
almost
a
honey
color
there
was
no
head
at
all
just
a
small
foamy
tan
ring
around
the
outside
of
my
pint
glass
the
nose
is
almost
nonexistent
as
well
only
some
bready
and
malty
notes
tickled
my
senses
it
taste
thin
and
the
only
pecan
i
get
is
the
scratchy
feeling
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
the
finish
is
dry
and
light
it
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
simple
yet
affective
its
not
bad
there
just
isnt
enough
to
it
hey
many
people
say
they
like
nuts
or
nutty
but
dont
bother
to
get
too
specific
about
it
and
plenty
of
beers
are
nutty
but
in
this
case
you
really
do
get
a
roasted
pecan
flavor
pretty
cool
poured
a
2
head
rich
brown
color
uh
pecan
brown
tastes
of
pecans
pralines
coffee
malt
and
it
really
had
a
pretty
lengthy
finish
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
even
the
lady
of
the
house
who
seldom
eats
nuts
thought
this
was
a
tasty
beer
drinkability
its
okay
went
allright
with
a
meal
meatloaf
but
not
well
with
that
meal
i
think
i
could
drink
it
alone
but
i
lost
interest
after
awhile
i
prefer
brown
ales
with
a
bit
more
malt
forward
flavors
an
okay
beer
drinks
ok
nothing
offputting
but
very
tame
in
all
aspects
producing
a
very
forgettable
beer
with
little
nut
and
little
brown
ale
characteristics
overall
nothing
to
blow
your
socks
off
here
subtle
interesting
flavor
with
the
pecans
easy
drinking
and
pleasant
would
make
a
fine
session
beer
would
drink
again
but
not
in
my
gottahaveit
arsenal
d
not
a
mindnumbingly
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
a
good
one
either
pours
a
clear
copper
color
54
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
earthy
malt
hint
of
hops
hint
of
grain
and
some
nutty
aroma
fits
the
style
of
an
american
brown
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
earthy
malt
hint
of
hop
hint
of
nut
and
a
hint
of
pale
malt
overall
good
blend
and
appearance
not
outstanding
but
better
than
its
current
rating
drinkability
i
went
into
this
tasting
with
some
skepticism
due
to
being
such
a
fan
of
southern
pecan
but
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
id
like
to
taste
them
both
back
to
back
sometime
to
make
a
fairer
comparison
complex
enough
in
its
taste
and
a
pretty
goodtasting
brew
ive
had
many
nut
brown
ales
with
nuttier
flavors
than
this
beer
which
actually
uses
pecans
pecan
nut
oil
lent
more
of
a
bittnerness
than
nut
flavor
more
akin
to
the
tannic
flavor
of
the
shell
overall
thin
and
uninterestng
which
is
too
bad
as
the
beer
sounds
great
in
theory
thin
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
just
not
a
lot
of
flavor
overall
a
fun
beer
if
you
dig
nuts
though
they
arent
too
overwhelming
would
definitely
be
a
boring
beer
without
the
nuts
smells
good
but
a
bit
thin
for
an
american
brown
ale
average
drinkability
though
i
am
happy
i
only
got
one
its
worth
a
try
but
a
whole
6er
might
be
tough
to
take
on
solid
two
fingers
of
cream
white
foam
good
density
mainly
microbubbles
with
a
few
just
small
bubbles
here
and
there
rentention
is
above
average
thin
lacing
at
best
light
amber
to
copper
orange
in
color
good
consistency
throughout
until
some
more
yellow
at
the
edges
transparent
no
meaningfully
visible
bubbles
the
nose
offers
a
coating
of
molasses
glaze
to
the
base
of
roasted
pecans
nothing
very
pushy
or
dominating
here
not
bready
more
like
scones
or
hard
biscuits
more
pepper
spice
than
and
flowers
or
other
softer
element
maybe
caramel
its
a
tossup
but
overall
probably
more
malty
than
hoppy
mediumbodied
sets
itself
in
the
mouth
firmly
carbonation
has
strength
but
rarely
exercises
it
sweeter
in
the
mouth
was
upfront
caramel
toffee
maple
syrup
notes
maybe
even
orange
peel
the
pecan
component
is
middling
never
absent
but
no
star
of
the
show
either
less
general
roastiness
than
expected
oil
stream
water
grass
than
something
like
banana
and
bubblegum
little
by
way
of
apricot
peach
fruit
no
glaring
defects
nor
anything
to
piss
you
off
just
not
much
going
down
d
this
beer
sounded
good
but
its
just
ok
generally
its
pretty
bland
with
only
subtle
hints
of
pecan
i
think
the
brewer
missed
the
mark
with
this
one
would
not
get
again
didnt
care
for
the
mouth
feel
would
have
liked
a
nutty
taste
overall
disappointing
drinkability
was
pretty
good
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
definitely
mostly
pecan
if
we
had
it
here
i
might
possibly
buy
it
again
d
very
drinkable
almost
like
a
newcastle
but
it
actually
has
flavor
pours
a
moderately
dark
chestnut
brown
on
in
this
instance
i
suppose
pecan
is
more
apt
nose
is
slight
caramel
and
doughy
malt
along
with
a
slight
hint
of
pecan
although
not
too
much
pecan
comes
through
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
comes
through
decently
enough
just
not
a
particularly
great
flavor
and
not
much
backing
it
up
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
would
have
expected
much
more
body
from
a
brown
ale
drinkability
is
fairly
poor
as
the
novelty
wears
off
after
a
few
ounces
drinkability
this
is
an
interesting
beer
pecans
could
definitely
lend
some
real
unique
flavors
to
beer
and
this
one
proves
that
however
this
relies
too
much
on
the
pecans
and
there
really
isnt
much
more
than
that
interesting
yes
however
depth
really
lacks
in
this
brew
drinkability
of
all
of
the
falls
beers
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
one
the
beer
had
a
watery
texture
in
my
mouth
and
the
flavors
were
not
in
balance
with
the
nose
it
instead
left
a
dry
bitterness
and
with
the
almost
no
hop
characters
present
in
the
nose
i
was
a
little
lost
at
this
finding
while
it
did
have
a
light
mouthfeel
and
i
am
used
to
drinking
hoppy
dry
beers
this
beer
would
have
had
an
easy
drinkabilty
yet
with
its
unbalanced
flavors
i
had
very
little
desire
to
do
so
d
the
yummy
sounding
title
of
this
brew
may
be
tantalizing
but
the
realization
of
that
idea
presented
here
is
not
good
this
ale
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
an
off
white
moderate
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
the
aromas
of
malt
and
nuts
are
pronounced
but
not
in
your
face
the
flavor
begins
with
nice
biscuity
and
slighly
yeasty
malt
flavors
which
give
way
to
the
distinct
but
not
overpowering
flavor
of
pecans
this
is
a
very
light
and
highly
drinkable
beer
that
delivers
exactly
what
it
promises
a
great
choice
for
a
change
of
pace
in
the
fall
or
winter
too
thin
and
watery
though
a
says
barkey
which
i
have
noticed
with
slightly
underripe
pecans
but
might
just
be
suggestion
i
really
didnt
like
this
beer
which
is
unusual
for
me
though
i
like
the
abita
beers
but
this
one
was
too
bitter
and
had
nothing
in
the
way
of
interesting
flavors
to
redeem
itself
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
and
i
wouldnt
drink
it
if
it
were
free
not
one
of
their
better
efforts
purple
haze
and
strawberry
harvest
are
both
must
better
beer
overall
an
ok
beer
thats
worth
a
try
just
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
d
pretty
good
a
bit
bland
but
if
you
can
get
past
that
then
its
ok
3
5
d
pretty
good
stuff
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
its
a
nice
easygoing
brew
thats
a
little
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
to
really
have
session
potential
worth
a
try
for
the
novelty
of
a
pecan
infused
brew
and
as
a
good
brew
from
the
craft
brewdeficient
southern
states
d
i
cant
say
i
was
let
down
because
ive
never
been
impressed
by
abita
but
this
started
out
with
some
promise
and
then
crashed
and
burned
forget
this
one
you
can
pack
these
away
pretty
quickly
not
a
bad
effort
at
all
even
if
my
bottle
isnt
superfresh
overall
its
a
little
bit
too
light
on
everything
its
pleasant
enough
and
whats
there
is
decent
but
i
really
want
more
more
character
and
more
flavor
drinkability
if
youre
a
home
brewer
this
taste
like
a
nut
brown
ales
wort
a
one
and
done
for
me
i
recommend
this
to
one
who
wants
to
try
what
a
carbonated
wort
taste
like
with
little
abv
d
a
pretty
good
brown
the
pecan
flavor
is
a
little
over
the
top
but
not
to
bad
makes
it
a
little
different
than
most
browns
ive
had
hey
it
is
an
abita
so
you
know
it
is
going
to
be
pretty
good
and
this
is
not
bad
not
overly
complex
but
is
smooth
sweet
and
nutty
give
it
a
try
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
and
i
do
but
i
am
not
excited
about
it
would
i
buy
it
again
maybe
but
i
probably
will
not
remember
anything
about
it
in
a
few
weeks
other
than
its
mediocrity
d
an
ok
brew
and
a
literal
nut
brown
ale
its
seriously
whetting
my
appetite
perhaps
the
high
point
of
this
experience
along
with
the
aroma
but
without
the
pecans
this
baby
would
be
very
substandard
a
good
beer
for
beginners
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
dark
amber
with
a
bubbly
head
that
hangs
around
laces
somewhat
i
am
reviewing
the
beer
i
am
currently
drinking
but
i
had
this
a
year
ago
and
really
loved
it
that
beer
was
full
of
pecan
sweetness
it
was
very
enjoyable
i
went
back
to
the
store
for
more
and
they
were
sold
out
i
eagerly
picked
it
up
again
this
year
and
frankly
there
is
nothing
special
about
it
bad
pecan
harvest
slightest
of
hints
of
a
nutty
aroma
but
taste
is
kinda
flat
not
bad
tasting
but
not
what
i
had
last
year
verdict
rather
straightforward
but
tasty
enough
pecan
harvest
ale
is
solid
little
beer
perhaps
not
as
unique
as
the
others
in
the
series
but
still
worth
a
try
for
nutty
brews
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
pecans
a
tad
sweet
taste
is
good
malts
hops
pecans
its
all
there
and
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
tasty
brew
d
i
see
no
reason
to
drink
or
buy
this
beer
again
it
wasnt
bad
just
uninteresting
and
not
really
worth
spending
any
more
time
money
or
sobriety
on
blipped
pecan
pie
by
golden
smog
overall
a
worthy
session
but
not
impressive
enough
to
seek
out
again
nothing
really
stands
out
kind
of
weak
and
muddy
d
the
biscuit
malt
seems
to
dominate
with
the
only
real
pecan
is
on
the
outside
of
the
bottle
its
an
ok
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
had
hopes
of
an
even
better
taste
from
my
first
pecan
ale
d
an
interesting
beer
the
unusual
sweetness
to
it
makes
me
reluctant
to
try
again
d
quite
drinkable
recent
abita
offerings
have
been
quite
solid
it
poured
a
light
amber
with
a
shitload
of
head
that
i
thought
would
overflow
my
perfect
pour
glass
the
aroma
was
very
light
with
a
bit
of
nut
to
it
the
taste
is
very
light
slightly
smoky
if
the
pecan
is
there
i
couldnt
find
it
it
left
my
mouth
a
little
dry
afterwards
to
the
point
of
being
annoying
no
me
gusta
the
flavor
really
lack
any
depth
and
never
makes
it
to
the
next
level
an
average
brew
this
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
and
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
fits
the
season
nicely
and
surely
a
good
addition
to
any
thanksgiving
day
table
12oz

at
nola

alto
poured
into
a
clear
plastic
cup
which
is
all
they
had
think
they
expected
me
to
drink
from
the
bottle
which
if
i
did
i
might
have
had
to
commit
ritual
suicide
afterwards
since
i
would
have
disgraced
myself
and
my
entire
family
by
doing
so
id
call
this
more
of
an
amber
ale
than
a
brown
ale
if
anything
pours
a
mostly
clear
amber
color
with
a
creamy
onefinger
white
head
aroma
is
caramel
malt

and
spice
flavor
is
somewhat
mild
but
pleasant
with
caramel
malt
pecans
bread
and
some
earthy
hop
bitterness
mediumlight
body
with
a
fairly
smooth
palate
and
soft
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
not
too
exciting
but
pretty
good
overall
d
easy
drinking
abv
somewhat
filling
driven
by
the
hefty
carbonation
flavors
are
light
not
overwhelming
overall
i
dont
find
this
beer
to
be
a
great
session
beer
pours
cloudy
amber
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
lasts
and
laces
aroma
is
something
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
smells
nutty
but
also
some
sort
of
funky
smell
underneath
mouthfeel
is
a
letdown
very
thin
was
expecting
something
richer
from
what
i
guess
woudl
really
be
a
nut
brown
flavor
is
dry
but
there
is
an
unsweetened
candied
pecan
flavor
to
it
not
bad
but
not
sure
that
it
was
great
either
interesting
but
im
not
sure
that
it
all
works
together
as
well
as
i
had
expected
this
is
not
one
abitas
best
brews
but
it
is
well
balanced
and
sessionable
as
a
seasonal
offering
for
something
different
the
tastes
flavors
seem
fresh
and
authentic
notes
unfortunately
it
is
quite
forgettable
abita
maybe
does
not
feel
like
a
topnotch
brewery
for
most
but
they
sure
can
do
better
than
this
however
this
one
is
not
a
brew
that
does
them
any
favors
go
lazy
magnolia
pecan
drinkability
the
pecan
flavor
is
obvious
but
not
cloying
the
overall
beer
is
not
too
impressive
but
isnt
offputting
in
any
way
it
could
be
one
of
the
best
abita
beers
ive
had
d
pretty
good
5
abv
a
fairly
average
brown
ale
with
a
little
bit
of
a
twist
with
real
louisiana
pecans
i
actually
would
have
liked
a
little
more
pecan
flavor
nothing
ill
be
rushing
back
for
other
than
that
the
beer
pours
a
clearish
cloudy
orange
with
a
thick
retentive
head
and
some
sweet
light
brown
sugar
light
hops
and
an
oily
sesame
taste
balance
is
a
bit
off
with
the
backbone
and
nut
flavors
battling
it
out
for
supremacy
decent
drinkability
but
nothing
special
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
expected
d
abita
makes
a
great
product
and
this
one
is
no
exception
try
with
good
cheeses
roux
soups
game
duck
or
thanksgiving
dinner
the
taste
is
a
bit
overly
processed
there
is
a
nutty
taste
to
the
beer
it
is
slightly
watery
there
are
some
odd
notes
on
the
backend
in
the
mid
section
the
beer
is
a
bit
too
clean
some
dryish
notes
with
some
mediocre
tasting
ale
highlights
i
guess
im
tasting
some
pecan
but
it
really
isnt
defined
that
well
this
beer
i
can
do
without
another
the
mouthfeel
is
adequate
not
much
aftertaste
a
bit
watery
not
a
keeper
simple
pleasant
but
not
extraordinary
beer
12oz
brown
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
slightly
hazy
reddish
gold
with
a
thin
whitehead
nice
aroma
this
is
where
you
get
the
most
pecan
character
light
to
medium
bodied
plenty
of
caramel
malt
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
beer
good
idea
to
use
a
seasonal
local
ingredient
d
a
great
ale
to
relax
to
and
enjoy
theres
nothing
too
offensive
or
challenging
about
this
flavor
glad
i
gave
this
a
try
and
ill
be
sure
to
grab
more
a
pretty
good
beginning
leads
to
some
disappoinment
at
the
end
oh
well
this
is
pretty
decent
enough
as
it
is
so
not
an
everyday
beer
for
sure
but
a
nice
beer
and
one
that
i
think
in
that
one
instance
will
shine
overall
impression
better
than
i
expected
this
was
drinkable
with
some
interesting
flavors
the
mouth
is
silky
smooth
and
creamy
it
could
stand
a
bit
more
of
a
carbonation
kick
but
its
decent
this
is
a
very
buttery
beer
tastes
of
buttered
bread
and
some
mild
pecan
flavor
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
bit
more
nutty
finishes
bready
and
a
little
drying
this
wasnt
really
what
i
expected
but
it
was
decent
nonetheless
md
smooth
light
medium
body
that
i
could
see
a
lot
of
abita
fans
really
digging
and
drinking
quite
a
bit
of
for
me
one
or
two
and
im
done
d
i
would
say
this
one
is
a
keeper
the
higher
than
expected
alcohol
content
encourages
me
to
enjoy
one
per
session
but
this
is
one
that
i
will
keep
in
my
rotation
of
fall
seasonal
beers
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it
go
for
it
its
worth
it
if
i
drank
this
without
knowing
it
i
dont
think
i
would
figure
out
its
supposed
to
be
a
pecan
ale
the
funky
zest
and
aftertaste
mar
this
one
a
bit
as
well
theres
a
sturdy
malt
back
but
id
never
get
this
one
as
a
specialty
ale
a
clear
amber
color
pour
with
a
two
finger
white
head
medium
carbonation
a
good
amount
of
jagged
lacing
left
aroma
of
light
sweet
malts
yeast
brown
sugar
and
a
faint
note
of
nuts
flavor
is
quite
subtle
nutty
as
promised
some
light
hops
and
more
brown
sugar
no
single
flavor
stands
out
quite
balanced
but
not
as
malty
as
i
had
hoped
thin
body
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
with
an
almost
dry
finish
leaving
a
light
hint
of
roasted
pecans
drinkable
but
not
sessionable
for
me
a
good
brew
but
nothing
special
pours
a
hazy
reddish
orange
with
a
medium
tan
head
not
very
brown
in
color
at
all
smell
is
of
pecans
that
went
bad
taste
is
a
bit
better
tart
malts
up
front
thin
middle
with
a
hint
of
pecan
in
the
finish
also
an
unusual
bitterness
that
does
not
seem
to
be
coming
from
hops
finish
is
also
very
dry
mouthfeel
is
average
average
carbonation
levels
as
well
drinkability
is
not
the
best
this
beer
is
ok
but
the
pecans
give
it
a
wierd
taste
that
i
dont
like
too
much
i
do
not
like
eating
pecans
as
it
is
so
that
might
be
part
of
it
if
you
are
a
pecan
lover
you
might
like
this
beer
otherwise
its
just
ok
dvery
drinabkle
love
the
sweet
nutty
flavor
could
be
contructed
a
bit
better
poured
from
a
stubby
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
medium
chestnut
color
with
about
a
finger
of
light
ecru
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
dominated
by
none
other
than
nuts
pecans
to
be
more
accurate
notes
of
toasted
bread
and
caramel
are
also
present
as
well
as
a
touch
of
earthy
bitter
hops
about
medium
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
for
the
style
a
simple
but
tasty
nutty
brown
ale
interesting
you
can
really
taste
the
pecan
hell
you
can
even
smell
it
but
does
it
fit
in
with
the
beer
im
not
sure
but
i
kind
of
like
it
its
weird
but
good
it
replicates
a
caramelcoated
pecan
it
doesnt
really
interfere
with
the
beer
its
just
an
oddtwist
but
is
an
oddtwist
enough
im
thinking
to
myself
right
now
out
at
the
bar
would
i
have
one
of
these
maybe
and
if
i
did
would
i
have
two
probably
not
but
id
definitely
have
one
at
home
two
in
a
row
probably
not
on
the
other
hand
and
ive
said
this
about
many
beers
before
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
have
with
thanksgiving
dinner
or
something
else
along
those
lines
and
although
its
not
particularly
rich
or
sweet
its
actually
really
well
balanced
with
just
the
pecan
nuttiness
added
into
the
mix
i
think
this
would
make
a
great
beer
to
relax
with
on
a
spring
summer
or
fall
evening
on
the
back
porch
as
the
sun
goes
down
and
the
stars
come
out
interesting
charming
worth
trying
overal
a
decent
drinker
though
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
nothing
impressive
overalla
quality
beer
that
had
a
flavor
that
just
wasnt
to
my
liking
sometimes
it
is
that
simple
darkpumpkin
orange
with
a
solid
finger
of
creamy
light
tan
head
that
leaaves
decent
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
roasted
pecan
nuttiness
and
biscuit
malt
tastes
nutty
and
unique
with
a
good
roasted
malt
backbone
and
lots
of
pecan
smooth
and
slightly
pecan
oily
on
the
palate
with
smooth
carbonation
a
real
suprise
that
tastes
better
that
i
thought
it
would
also
not
really
close
to
a
traditional
brown
ale
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
standard
12
inch
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
fine
ring
fed
by
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
smells
of
an
oily
nutty
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
amount
of
oil
that
slides
around
the
tongue
carbonation
picks
up
a
bit
once
inside
bittering
hops
balancing
things
out
well
finishes
with
an
afterthought
of
nuttiness
quite
a
solid
little
beer
seems
to
be
somewhat
sessionable
worth
checking
out
if
its
available
d
a
decent
beer
but
the
hope
for
pecan
taste
left
me
wanting
this
is
just
a
soso
brown
ale
from
abita
drinkability
is
just
average
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
i
believe
the
first
ive
had
with
real
nuts
good
job
abita
this
brew
pours
up
a
murky
copper
color
with
a
nice
big
frothy
off
white
head
the
nose
is
subtle
sweet
malts
pecans
mild
fall
spices
earth
i
taste
sweet
pale
malts
subtle
crisp
hops
mild
spices
a
very
crisp
and
clean
beer
this
would
make
a
solid
session
brew
i
dig
it
this
one
was
decent
certainly
not
offensive
but
it
just
lacked
any
real
character
i
could
see
this
pecan
idea
being
pretty
good
but
in
order
for
that
to
happen
it
needs
a
better
base
beer
dextremely
drinkable
goes
down
easy
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
and
texture
pours
a
good
sized
head
white
but
very
quickly
diminishing
amber
orange
colored
fizzy
body
very
fizzy
soda
smelling
aroma
syrupy
maltiness
along
with
some
nuttiness
maybe
pecans
too
very
grainy
aroma
grainy
malty
pecan
taste
very
carbonated
a
little
dusty
has
that
unique
abita
taste
to
it
maybe
its
the
water
i
like
the
pecan
but
not
the
abita
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
light
but
fizzy
carbonation
tiny
bit
watery
drinkability
i
like
it
especially
as
a
seasonal
fall
ale
it
has
an
interesting
taste
i
could
easily
session
this
this
is
a
good
beer
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
pecans
and
southern
pecan
is
unavailable
this
will
more
than
satisfy
o
a
drinkable
beer
the
extreme
pecanness
could
detract
from
the
overall
drinkability
of
it
after
about
2
beers
but
if
youre
really
into
the
pecan
flavor
you
will
dig
this
i
really
thought
i
remembered
this
being
better
last
year
not
by
much
but
still
very
refreshing
initially
but
halfway
through
it
just
seemed
forced
the
appearance
was
really
good
its
almost
like
it
enticed
me
to
drink
but
when
i
did
i
almost
wished
i
hadnt
the
appearance
and
the
pecan
name
made
me
get
my
hopes
up
but
smelling
and
tasting
left
much
to
be
desired
worth
trying
but
nothing
i
would
actively
seek
out
again
decent
overall
has
a
bit
of
a
watery
diluted
feel
but
a
good
taste
pretty
mediocre
atmosphere
does
have
good
drinkability
though
since
its
only
out
for
a
short
while
worth
picking
up
a
sixer
solid
quaff
maybe
the
pecans
add
to
the
nice
smoothness
of
this
beer
or
maybe
the
word
pecans
just
helps
sell
this
one
either
way
its
worth
a
shot
if
youre
into
trying
new
things
pours
medium
translucent
brown
with
a
tall
foamy
head
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
but
otherwise
just
a
swirl
after
the
first
few
minutes
nose
is
a
little
nutty
and
sweet
but
not
as
pecany
as
i
was
expecting
taste
is
a
little
bitter
up
front
with
some
pecan
flavors
not
as
deep
pecany
or
buttery
as
i
would
have
expected
it
was
a
bit
thin
overall
its
a
very
runofthemill
beer
the
pecan
harvest
name
gave
me
really
high
hopes
for
a
nutty
flavor
and
really
raw
feel
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
tad
uninspired
edit
2009
i
would
like
to
add
that
this
beer
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
after
a
couple
of
pale
ales
or
ipas
i
notice
the
pecan
taste
is
a
bit
stronger
making
the
beer
a
bit
fuller
still
a
good
beer
to
buy
from
abita
when
you
have
the
chance
nice
beer
though
all
aspects
are
muted
and
light
very
easily
quaffable
though
i
could
drink
many
d
this
was
a
good
example
of
a
brown
ale
and
as
a
southerner
that
loves
pecans
i
was
excited
that
a
company
decided
to
blend
the
two
however
i
would
have
like
the
pecan
to
shine
more
in
this
beer
as
rogues
hazelnut
does
for
them
the
aroma
is
mostly
malty
earthy
only
a
slight
sign
of
pecans
or
nuts
the
appearance
is
very
attractive
a
nice
reddishbrown
clear
carbonation
bubbles
decent
offwhite
head
lacing
on
glass
the
flavor
is
definitely
pecan
nutty
some
sweet
malts
honey
molasses
come
through
the
finish
has
a
slight
hop
bite
starting
as
the
beer
heads
for
the
back
of
the
throat
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
thick
nice
enjoyable
beer
but
not
a
great
brown
ale
by
any
means
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
flawwise
but
i
cant
see
drinking
more
than
this
bottle
that
was
given
to
me
it
would
however
be
a
great
addition
to
all
kinds
of
dishes
from
barbecue
to
desserts
as
a
reductionglaze
overall
as
nut
ales
go
this
ones
quite
good
just
enough
nut
character
without
going
overboard
i
would
look
for
this
again
drinkable
brew
d
light
body
enhances
drinkability
no
doubt
but
the
flatness
of
the
flavor
profile
limits
the
overall
enjoyment
of
this
beer
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
the
only
pecan
ale
besides
southern
pecan
ill
stick
with
southern
pecanit
has
more
body
and
flavor
still
this
is
worth
seeking
out
for
anyone
eager
to
try
a
pecan
ale
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
nice
nutty
character
it
also
has
a
complimentary
bisquity
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
bisquity
flavor
with
a
bit
od
crystal
malt
sweetness
it
goes
dow
easy
and
finishes
thin
with
a
subtle
nittiness
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
its
too
thin
in
the
finish
and
it
has
some
metallic
off
flavors
notes
from
3608
the
aroma
does
have
some
pecans
but
it
seems
somewhat
strange
not
bad
but
odd
in
a
paper
kind
of
way
there
is
some
malt
though
the
appearance
is
orange
and
the
head
thin
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
bitter
nutty
finish
the
palate
is
thin
its
a
nice
try
but
not
great
drinkability
this
one
is
interesting
sort
of
a
novelty
but
not
much
more
sort
of
like
a
watereddown
pecan
pie
but
its
really
not
one
id
see
myself
returning
to
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
better
than
average
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
the
sweetness
at
the
start
is
short
lived
followed
by
a
prolonged
bitterness
from
the
hops
there
is
a
slight
nuttiness
throughout
d
this
is
a
nice
light
sessionable
brew
the
taste
falls
a
bit
short
of
expectations
given
the
phenomenal
smell
i
would
not
turn
one
of
these
down
however
12
ounce
bottle
best
before
2112009
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
orangecopper
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
lacing
and
head
retention
are
boht
average
aroma
is
sweet
and
caramel
malt
pecans
and
some
toffee
and
butterscotch
the
aroma
is
also
a
bit
light
unfortunately
the
taste
is
lighter
than
the
aroma
is
what
i
can
taste
isnt
bad
because
its
similar
to
the
aroma
but
its
just
not
strong
at
all
it
also
has
a
slight
bitter
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
smooth
but
a
bit
thin
and
watery
with
decent
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
for
the
price
7
79
a
sixer
i
wouldnt
pick
this
up
again
as
its
not
a
good
value
for
the
price
but
if
you
find
a
single
bottle
of
this
anywhere
its
worth
a
try
very
fresh
tasting
and
highly
drinkable
i
bought
two
six
packs
and
am
liking
my
decision
more
with
each
one
of
these
i
drink
and
im
not
really
an
amber
ale
fan
i
would
buy
this
again
fo
sho
well
done
abita
d
looks
and
smells
great
but
slightly
dissappointing
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
departments
respectable
and
original
but
not
remarkable
drinkability
pretty
high
the
carbonation
makes
it
go
down
smoothly
and
the
alcohol
doesnt
bite
at
all
drinkability
is
very
good
it
went
very
well
with
dinner
mock
tender
steaks
and
potatoes
like
the
few
other
brews
from
abita
ive
tried
this
is
a
lighter
style
than
might
be
expected
from
a
fall
harvest
release
but
it
seems
very
suited
to
southern
climes
and
foods
goes
great
with
grilled
burgers
easy
to
drink
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
thin
creme
head
nose
is
like
peanut
butter
flavor
is
a
bit
tangy
but
carries
a
full
enough
amount
of
pecan
to
be
noticed
no
great
complexity
but
its
nice
smooth
liquid
feel
carbonation
is
mid
range
nice
to
drink
its
smooth
enough
and
a
pretty
drinkable
nut
brown
i
bet
this
would
be
nice
on
cask
poured
a
pretty
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
it
seems
to
have
pretty
low
carbonation
it
smells
wonderfulvery
nutty
and
a
little
fruity
it
feels
mediumbodied
and
its
flavor
is
just
as
wonderful
at
the
smell
you
can
really
taste
the
pecan
and
it
finishes
very
smoothly
this
brew
really
offers
an
enjoyable
experienceill
definitely
buy
this
one
again
and
i
highly
recommend
other
to
try
it
very
drinkable
but
not
as
breathtaking
as
i
was
hoping
being
from
the
south
pecans
have
long
played
a
role
in
my
diet
my
home
is
on
an
old
pecan
plantation
and
i
have
pecan
trees
in
my
backyard
sadly
they
just
dont
seem
to
play
much
of
a
role
in
this
ale
overall
had
to
try
it
im
in
the
south
and
pecan
seasonal
beer
i
mean
come
on
its
pretty
good
definitely
worth
trying
for
the
originality
of
it
d
id
share
this
at
a
seasonal
gathering
without
feeling
like
its
out
of
place
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
brew
especially
after
some
of
abitas
other
great
beers
however
this
beer
was
a
huge
disappointment
and
i
knew
it
the
minute
i
saw
how
lightly
coppered
the
pour
was
the
head
was
nice
but
disappeared
quickly
i
didnt
notice
even
one
hint
of
pecan
smell
or
taste
throughout
this
creation
the
mouthful
is
extremly
light
and
crisp
but
leaves
you
hoping
for
more
you
could
very
easily
drink
alot
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
not
a
complete
failure
for
abita
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
products
abita
pecan
ale
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
nice
malty
aroma
i
cant
really
smell
any
pecan
though
there
is
a
medium
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
quite
malty
with
a
bit
of
nutty
flavor
which
i
couldnt
really
attribute
to
pecan
but
its
pretty
good
in
any
case
there
really
arent
any
hops
that
are
noticeable
but
thats
appropriate
in
a
brown
ale
definitely
decent
worth
a
try
mouthfeeldrinkability
fairly
thin
mouthfeel
but
pretty
refreshing
going
down
i
think
this
could
make
a
great
entry
level
beer
for
your
bud
light
friends
i
always
buy
a
few
of
these
when
they
come
around
every
year
this
is
a
pretty
boring
beer
i
assume
its
labeled
a
brown
ale
because
of
the
pecans
its
really
not
more
like
an
amber
ale
with
pecans
nice
nutty
aroma
but
not
much
to
it
at
all
its
not
bad
its
just
pretty
mediocre
no
thanks
t
m
d
light
subtle
maltiness
with
a
dash
of
bitterness
on
the
tongue
a
little
nuttiness
going
on
a
sweet
edge
a
little
tinny
in
some
ways
thin
light
and
inoffensive
an
easy
drinker
without
totally
giving
up
flavour
kinda
numbing
great
to
drink
back
without
thinking
about
it
too
much
lightbodied
and
refreshing
with
a
spritz
of
carbonation
not
something
id
want
to
drink
all
the
time
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
not
a
heavyhitter
but
nice
just
the
same
try
it
with
a
big
bowl
of
sausage
jambalaya
the
sweet
will
compliment
the
spice
d
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
nothing
special
this
beer
poured
a
very
light
reddish
brown
that
was
highly
translucent
the
scent
was
actually
very
pleasing
for
such
a
light
looking
beer
it
was
rather
sweet
with
a
certain
nuttiness
the
flavor
was
very
light
but
caramel
malt
was
clearly
present
this
beer
certainly
didnt
prove
to
be
very
complex
but
it
certainly
is
a
very
drinkable
brown
you
could
almost
think
of
it
as
a
light
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
considering
i
usually
dont
care
for
abita
this
could
make
for
a
decent
session
brown
overall
a
pretty
refreshing
brown
ale
mouthfeel
is
pretty
average
slightly
carbonated
a
bit
watery
but
not
bad
overall
a
mediocre
brew
that
probably
wasnt
worth
the
price
very
average
pecan
ale
no
brown
not
even
i
dont
quite
know
what
abita
was
going
for
here
but
to
tout
about
using
real
pecans
in
the
brewing
ive
had
plenty
of
beers
with
more
nutty
flavor
than
this
and
they
didnt
use
nuts
in
the
brewing
great
overall
beer
poured
a
clear
brown
color
with
thin
white
head
smelled
of
nuts
tastes
of
nuts
good
malts
caramel
and
there
is
a
smokey
flavor
too
there
was
never
a
bad
moment
in
the
aftertaste
it
kept
me
wanting
more
goes
down
smooth
i
had
3
and
that
was
probably
a
good
number
not
sure
if
i
wanted
another
i
would
glady
buy
this
again
i
recommend
it
for
any
beer
drinker
appears
clear
dark
copper
brown
hue
with
a
large
bright
off
white
head
leaves
behind

intricate
lacing
as
it

aroma

a
nice
peacan
roastiness
about

through
as

very
nice
balanced

a
reserved
nutty
character
ala
the
pecan
additions
moderate
sweetness
with
caramel
malts
surrounding
the
roasted
pecan

ample
bitterness
this
is
a
nice
fall
beer
that
i
will
be
willing
to
drink
again
and
again
motuhfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
range
a
bit
of
residual
sweetness
adss
some
extra
texture
to
it
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
solid
easy
to
drain
nicely
doen
additive
pecans
were
very
natural
with
earthiness
proving
there
was
no
extract
to
creat
a
cloying
mess
nice
brew
drinkability
very
good
nice
and
light
albeit
a
tad
sweet
alongside
its
light
mouthfeel
the
crisp
and
refreshing
if
unfortunately
somewhat
watery
nature
of
this
ale
does
make
it
eminently
drinkable
drinkability
not
the
greatest
beer
ever
but
good
and
worth
a
try
not
bad
although
certainly
not
your
typical
american
brown
ale
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
and
very
carbonated
makes
it
easy
to
drink
and
appropriate
in
character
for
the
hot
humid
days
in
the
south
i
can
see
how
this
would
be
a
popular
brew
in
that
part
of
the
country
for
me
i
think
either
more
pecans
or
less
carbonation
even
would
make
this
a
better
beer
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
pours
pale
copper
into
my
glass
the
beer
settles
in
as
filtered
pale
copper
with
a
big
fuzzy
head
at
first
before
slowing
receeding
the
aroma
is
pleasant
toffeeish
and
nutty
the
pecans
are
worked
nicely
in
the
nose
in
fact
the
pecans
are
worked
nicely
in
the
taste
as
well
its
light
enough
for
the
subtropical
weather
from
where
it
hails
but
flavorful
enough
to
keep
you
interested
toffee
and
nuts
prevail
on
the
palate
with
a
hoppy
note
lingering
on
in
the
aftertaste
certainly
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
brown
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
off
white
foam
head
leaving
behind
speckled
lacing
throughout
the
glass
not
much
to
smell
but
picked
up
slight
hints
of
malt
and
nuts
the
taste
was
decent
with
definite
nutty
flavors
coming
through
although
the
malt
was
more
predominant
no
pecans
to
speak
of
but
similar
to
a
nut
brown
ale
good
carbonation
finishing
crisp
an
fairly
clean
not
a
bad
beer
similar
to
a
nut
brown
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
worth
trying
once
low
carbonation
a
bit
syrupy
which
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
in
my
opinion
otherwise
quite
tasty
something
a
little
different
and
worth
trying
once
d
a
decent
nut
brown
ale
but
probably
only
average
as
far
as
brown
ales
go
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
had
an
orange
honey
color
with
an
inch
of
head
that
quickly
diminished
to
what
cant
really
be
called
a
sheenemilio
estevez
as
hard
as
i
tried
to
smell
pecans
they
were
not
there
and
neither
was
anything
else
for
that
matter
tasted
crisp
and
light
with
a
minor
nutty
finish
i
expected
more
pecan
but
they
were
not
there
its
an
ok
beer
i
suppose
but
not
what
i
had
hoped
for
easy
to
drink
but
dont
get
this
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
flavorful
pecan
experience
d
a
little
lack
luster
compared
to
what
the
smell
suggested
not
bad
but
would
definately
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
semi
transluscent
amber
pour
with
a
short
lived
off
white
head
smell
is
light
caramelly
malt
with
at
times
slight
hints
of
pecans
not
very
noticeable
but
i
think
i
smelled
pecan
pie
at
times
taste
is
pretty
much
a
simple
malty
amber
with
mild
bitterness
and
no
real
hop
flavor
to
speak
of
notes
of
pecan
in
some
sips
but
faint
a
touch
boring
but
not
bad
a
very
solid
offering
from
abita
thanks
to
barefootbrewer
for
the
sample
i
think
im
not
sure
if
thats
wrong
let
me
know
give
it
a
shot
just
dont
expect
too
much
and
you
will
be
fairly
happy
solid
brew
i
believe
the
pecans
should
be
noticeable
but
in
the
background
as
this
one
presents
you
dont
want
a
pecan
husk
in
a
glass
to
drink
pours
a
nice
semicloudy
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
creamy
tannish
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
the
nose

tangy

some

the
taste
is

and

medium

drinkable
not
too
bad
but
would
not
buy
if
it
was
in
my
area
but
glad
to
have
try
it
notes
a
decent
to
below
average
brew
d
interesting
but
as
far
as
pecan
nut
browns
go
i
think
lazy
magnolias
southern
pecan
has
it
beat
an
interesting
beer
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
nothing
special
d
not
terrible
but
i
certainly
wont
get
this
again
especially
with
a
great
local
brewerymt
carmel
that
makes
a
nice
nut
brown
d
i
wasnt
impressed
but
it
is
worth
a
shot
to
see
what
the
abita
brewery
can
do
made
with
real
louisana
pecans
props
for
trying
something
unique
and
different
but
the
aroma
and
lackluster
flavor
falls
short
here
pours
a
clear
goldenorange
color
with
a
light
off
white
head
there
is
some
muskiness
on
the
nose
with
light
pecans
and
fresh
bread
flavor
is
light
malt
with
an
earthy
bittering
hop
bite
perhaps
a
tad
bit
to
much
with
a
touch
of
nuttiness
and
citrus
on
the
fade
flavor
is
moderate
at
best
the
pecans
really
do
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
or
give
it
some
character
mouthful
is
very
light
and
watery
drinkability
is
moderate
at
best
and
wouldn¬ít
recommend
it
if
not
just
for
the
sake
of
saying
you
had
a
pecan
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
decent
representation
of
style
it¬ís
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
certainly
would
be
the
first
that
i
would
choose
even
within
the
style
overall
creamy
smooth
and
tasty
a
tad
subdued
on
flavor
but
easily
drinkable
likeable
unusual
taste
and
more
of
a
bitter
hoppy
vibe
the
pecan
oil
infusion
is
subtle
but
distinctive
and
abitas
beers
are
usually
pretty
classy
and
unique
this
is
no
exception
there
are
tastier
specialtynovelty
beers
out
there
but
i
still
give
pecan
harvest
high
marks
for
creativity
pours
out
a
still
maple
syrup
with
a
thin
head
smells
of
toasty
malts
with
faint
fruity
esters
and
nuts
theres
a
hint
of
manure
in
the
nose
flavor
is
of
toast
faint
fruit
just
a
hint
of
nuts
probably
some
kind
of
placebo
from
knowing
that
there
are
pecans
in
this
and
a
dose
of
graininess
really
the
only
thing
remotely
pecan
about
this
is
the
ending
astringency
much
like
after
eating
a
pecan
that
still
has
some
of
the
lessedible
parts
attached
to
the
nut
body
is
solid
oily
and
has
stinging
bubbles
pretty
disappointed
in
this
one
and
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
pecan
character
d
well
that
was
a
let
down
i
was
really
hoping
this
was
going
to
be
full
and
flavorful
instead
its
watery
and
boring
shucks
presentation
packaged
in
a
short
twelveounce
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
let
this
brew
warm
up
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
it
just
a
little
underwhelming
i
was
hoping
for
more
nuts
i
would
still
buy
this
at
least
a
few
times
a
year
if
i
had
access
to
it
cheers
dave
and
thanks
again
d
not
bad
but
a
little
bland
would
like
something
a
bit
more
bold
nut
notes
come
through
but
barely
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
whatever
abita
intended
the
pecans
to
do
they
need
to
boost
it
a
lot
to
get
it
across
better
which
makes
the
beer
a
little
less
drinkable
than
it
could
be
tone
down
the
bubbbles
ramp
up
the
flavor
and
add
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
wed
be
in

on
it
for
my
taste

red

thin

with
weak

nutty
somewhat
also

gross
old

alcohol
notes
not
much

in
the
attack
some
bitterness
and
caramel
pecan
rises
briefly
along
with
a
reasonable
maltiness
in
the
middle
but
that
fades
to
a
memory
and
all
im
left
with
is
an
ethanol
tang
like
i
just
took
a
big
old
swig
of
colt
45
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
oily
it
occurs
to
me
as
i
drink
this
that
abita
needs
to
take
advantage
of
their
brewpub
when
they
get
the
urge
to
brew
a
beer
with
pecans
or
some
other
crazy
thing
brewpub
patrons
love
to
get
something
odd
and
off
the
wall
even
if
it
doesnt
taste
very
good
but
apparantly
they
decided
they
would
bottle
some
of
the
brewpub
beers
bad
move
this
beer
is
a
muddled
loser
of
a
drink
poured
into
a
pint
mug
this
beer
is
an
orangeamber
color
with
the
slightest
of
heads
its
a
bit
hazy
also
nose
is
malty
with
a
pleasant
nuttiness
tastes
quite
a
bit
similar
to
the
abita
amber
with
a
slightly
toasty
nutty
malt
not
identifiably
pecan
to
my
taste
buds
enough
bitterness
to
offset
any
sweetness
and
dry
out
the
finish
a
bit
and
a
lightly
fruity
yeast
character
nice
wellcarbonated
but
creamy
texture
drinkability
could
be
better
kudos
to
them
for
actually
using
nuts
instead
of
an
artificial
flavoring
but
im
not
enough
of
a
fan
to
recommend
it
a
good
effort
but
needs
retooling
in
my
book
its
almost
llike
they
started
with
the
nuts
and
tried
to
build
a
beer
around
it
instead
of
the
other
way
around
back
to
the
drawing
board
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
different
for
sure
and
that
is
great
for
the
beer
world
nice
job
slightly
watery
although
the
carbonation
is
not
overdone
overall
a
highly
drinkable
if
uninteresting
offering
from
abita
a
neat
idea
though
drinkability
comes
across
as
a
true
harvest
fall
ale
would
drink
again
d
not
something
that
is
extremely
drinkable
for
me
it
is
more
of
a
novelty
and
an
experiment
gone
wrong
not
sweet
like
a
pecan
pie
just
kind
of
off
in
flavor
and
feel
the
smell
and
taste
remind
me
of
musty
foot
odor
if
i
had
to
pick
something
to
compare
it
to
wet
basement
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
did
like
it
much
better
than
the
amber
that
abita
puts
out
i
could
not
really
taste
the
pecan
taste
but
it
did
have
a
nut
taste
to
it
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
as
before
the
amber
was
okay
it
was
a
last
resort
type
beer
overall
this
did
make
me
want
to
try
the
other
beers
that
abita
puts
out
stay
away
from
this
one
don¬ít
drink
and
review
when
poured
out
this
beer
was
dark
brown
in
color
the
head
was
weak
probably
due
to
the
high
amount
of
oils
in
this
beer
the
aroma
was
very
nutty
which
tended
to
mask
any
trace
of
malt
or
hop
aroma
if
present
the
taste
is
initially
nutty
but
quickly
fades
the
beer
itself
felt
very
limp
on
the
tougue
suggesting
a
light
body
which
probably
explains
the
dry
finish
and
overall
flavor
a
beer
is
always
supposed
to
have
you
want
to
drink
more
and
i
just
did
not
have
that
with
this
brew
really
nice
treat
pours
a
goldenorange
and
quite
surprisingly
cloudy
alomst
like
a
wheat
very
nice
smell
of
whatta
you
think
nuts
tastes
much
like
a
handful
of
pecans
with
a
nice
smooth
ale
added
to
the
mix
very
smooth
tasty
and
highly
recommended
especially
for
the
time
of
year
this
is
a
oneshot
treat
brewed
just
once
so
id
say
give
it
a
try
i
dont
think
youll
be
disappointed
nice
one
abita
cheers
and
saaaalute
my
ba
friends
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
brown
ale
overall
i
think
the
complexity
of
the
beer
makes
it
worth
a
try
although
i
probably
would
not
go
beyond
that
with
all
that
being
said
ill
say
that
i
still
think
this
is
a
pretty
quaffable
beer
the
thin
body
makes
it
go
down
pretty
easy
and
that
pecan
taste
is
pretty
good
if
your
into
the
nutty
tasting
browns
thing
i
personally
think
that
you
could
do
worse
during
this
fall
drinking
season
this
beer
poured
with
a
translucent
copper
brown
body
and
a
two
inch
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lace
the
smell
is
faint
with
toasted
malts
a
slight
roastedness
and
hints
of
nuttiness
the
flavor
is
a
combination
of
caramel
malts
and
toastyness
with
hints
of
nuts
that
are
presumable
from
the
pecans
overall
i
find
this
flavor
more
enjoyable
than
the
average
brown
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
with
sharp
carbonation
but
a
decent
body
it
is
a
nice
brown
certainly
drinkable
but
it
would
seem
as
if
my
taste
buds
lend
me
more
towards
the
hoppy
and
nutty
browns
d
the
back
label
raves
about
this
beer
being
wonderful
pairedup
with
both
red
meats
and
seafood
and
with
nuts
too
seeing
as
we
have
three
more
bottles
well
give
it
a
try
paired
with
food
next
time
as
is
its
a
mildly
interesting
though
ultimately
underwhelming
brew
worth
a
try
d
very
drinkable
but
would
you
want
to
worth
a
try
d
a
good
beer
glad
i
tried
it
certainly
something
new
but
at
8
69
a
sixpack
its
a
little
pricey
probably
wont
go
back
to
it
unless
i
can
find
a
single
taste
is
a
not
very
sweet
malt
a
nuttiness
that
almost
gives
it
a
bitter
flavor
and
a
slight
caramelmolassas
taste
pretty
aggressive
carbonation
and
a
full
mouthfeel
it
was
actually
called
abita
pecan
harvest
ale
it
poured
with
about
1
5
fingers
of
a
foamy
tawny
head
with
decent
retention
throughout
the
nose
was
maltysweet
with
a
caramellike
quality
to
it
the
color
was
a
lovely
deepamber
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
good
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
a
definite
nuttybitter
characteristic
i
was
glad
that
i
did
a
the
label
directed
and
cracked
one
open
scored
a
bottle
of
this
while
in
mass
poured
a
nice
reddishamber
color
aroma
was
strong
and
malty
but
i
could
not
detect
any
hint
of
pecan
despite
the
labels
claims
when
i
tasted
this
ale
though
it
started
out
nutty
and
finished
with
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
sometimes
smell
is
not
enough
regardless
this
ale
is
definitely
drinkable
and
i
look
forward
to
sampling
other
beers
from
abita
this
is
interesting
stuff
to
say
the
least
literally
a
nut
brown
ale
not
bad
an
ale
brewed
with
louisiana
pecans
sounds
interesting
12oz
twistoff
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
colored
amber
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
great
deal
of
lacing
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dry
and
nutty
with
some
toasted
malts
the
smell
is
perfect
for
a
nice
autumn
day
the
taste
starts
out
smooth
and
malty
and
finishes
with
a
dry
and
nutty
finish
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
abita
beers
that
i
have
tried
mk
a
pecan
harvest
ale
something
different
to
trypoured
a
beautiful
rich
amberbrown
with
a
tight
formed
well
sustained
12
white
head
very
nice
to
look
at
very
muted
aromas
a
little
of
the
nuttiness
imparted
from
the
pecans
and
a
touch
of
caramel
not
much
hop
presence
to
be
hadmild
but
nice
flavors
a
little
nutty
and
on
the
drier
side
with
some
biscuit
qualities
a
bit
of
residual
earthiness
in
the
finish
nothing
remarkable
about
this
beer
but
its
food
friendly
and
has
a
little
flavor
dthis
is
a
tasty
drink
better
than
the
fallfest
mouth
feel
is
sort
of
creamy
not
too
thin
and
not
too
heavy
pretty
much
appropriate
for
an
american
brown
not
giving
itself
into
becoming
sticky
and
cloying
like
you
might
expect
from
something
that
reminds
you
of
praline
candy
beer
is
a
nice
amber
color
slightly
off
white
head
no
trace
of
lace
again
drinkability
altogether
dull
and
dreary
ive
gotten
stronger
nuttier
flavors
from
nonnut
beers
even
as
i
finish
drinking
this
beer
the
thumb
points
down
when
i
think
about
a
pecan
harvest
ale
i
think
of
a
maltly
nutty
rich
favor
to
mix
with
my
turkey
dinner
im
still
looking
for
the
malty
flavor
this
beer
starts
beautifully
with
a
pour
that
bring
a
nice
head
to
light
the
head
fades
much
too
quickly
to
become
a
shadow
of
itself
the
nose
is
nondescript
the
body
is
light
to
go
with
a
beer
charterized
by
a
the
right
look
of
a
fall
leaves
in
tones
of
orangereddish
colors
the
flavors
are
only
soso
lacking
the
warmth
i
expected
and
the
mouth
feel
is
that
of
an
over
carbonated
finish
with
a
slight
hop
aftertaste
lets
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
a
lightbodied
refreshing
brew
that
achieves
its
goal
of
a
pecan
brew
remarkably
well
fresh
pecans
with
a
bittersweet
backing
unique
nice
to
see
a
wellbeer
made
with
local
character
d
this
is
a
decent
beer
its
as
i
scored
it
completely
average
drinkable
absolutely
this
would
likely
make
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
a
nice
offering
from
the
usually
tame
abita
beers
we
are
used
to
drinking
this
was
a
simple
pleasure
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
get
some
of
this
drinkability
ok
but
worth
a
try
just
due
to
its
unusual
nature
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
d
extremely
drinkable
and
not
surprisingly
wonderful
with
a
handful
of
salty
peanuts
and
hazelnuts
would
have
even
been
better
if
pecans
were
available

a

still

mouthfeel

and
kind

goes
down
easily
an
interesting
brew
but
ultimately
doesnt
really
grab
me
worth
a
try
on
a
single
though
and
a
cool
concept
as
i
always
like
to
see
something
different
mouthfeeldrinkability
crisp
and
alive
becoming
smoother
and
foamy
as
my
glass
reluctantly
empties
this
is
an
unbelievably
rewarding
tasting
as
i
have
just
discovered
possibly
the
greatest
session
beer
currently
available
in
the
u
s
today
this
drinks
so
effortlessly
and
its
got
everything
a
great
social
beer
should
probably
a
low
abv
a
soft
round
flavor
profile
and
exquisite
balance
with
a
dry
finish
i
love
this
beer
poured
with
an
attractive
copper
color
that
didn¬ít
have
much
head
and
did
not
retain
it
for
very
long
aroma
is
not
very
strong
but
earthy
with
faint
nuttiness
to
it
did
not
leave
much
lacing
on
glass
taste
is
also
earthy
with
slight
pecan
flavor
mouthfeel
was
good
and
despite
average
flavor
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
d
very
high
and
i
really
like
this
one
a
lot
could
become
a
go
to
fall

me

the

is
quite
light

is
very
pleasant
and
is
just
enough
to
differentiate
it
from
other
browns
hop
balance
keeps
it
nice
and
refreshing
thanks
ding
for
the
opportunity
this
one
is
not
bad
overall
the
pecan
notes
that
are
in
the
mix
make
for
a
nice
twist
on
the
style
and
even
there
this
one
seems
to
fall
a
bit
in
between
the
brown
ale
and
amber
ale
styles
although
it
certainly
leans
more
toward
the
former
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
easy
to
drink
a
solid
beer

going
to
blow
you

raleigh
i
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
to
a
50
degree
tumbler
the
color
was
kinda
orange
with
a
fine
bubbly
head
that
decayed
pretty
fast
the
looked
slightly
cloudy
to
me
and
i
thought
the
smell
was
terrible
and
cant
quite
describe
it
other
than
it
stunk
the
beer
had
a
slighly
nutty
taste
but
not
overbearing
i
thought
the
beer
was
actually
pretty
good
and
would
like
to
try
one
on
tap
pours
a
clean
orangeish
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
aromas
that
start
sweet
and
a
dry
nuttiness
in
the
taste
sweet
brown
sugar
and
it
tastes
a
bit
nutty
a
sweet
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
nutty
aftertaste
tastes
more
like
a
brown
ale
yet
a
bit
too
sweet
but
ok
pours
amber
with
small
white
head
which
disapates
quickly
flavor
is
a
mix
of
pale
and
amber
ale
notes
with
mild
malt
a
little
toffee
and
a
nutty
toasted
biscuit
center
real
pecans
give
it
a
nice
nutty
sweet
finish
very
well
balanced
the
light
hopping
compliments
the
smooth
malt
taste
perfectly
a
great
autumn
beer
this
beer
isnt
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
with
tons
of
malt
or
a
huge
amount
of
flavor
from
the
pecans
but
it
is
a
very
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
offering
from
abita
the
mouth
is
pleasantly
thickish
easy
enough
drinker
this
would
be
an
easy
beer
to
pair
with
cheese
crackers
and
of
course
nuts
you¬íd
be
nuts
not
to
try
this
one
out
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
certainly
a
fine
alternative
to
all
the
oktoberfests
on
the
shelves
right
now
although
admittedly
im
a
sucker
for
oktoberfest
beers
i
like
to
see
a
quality
brewery
like
abita
venturing
out
into
the
lesser
known
styles
this
is
a
fine
addition
to
their
annual
repertoire
in
my
opinion
cheers
a
different
beer
and
completely
different
than
what
i
envisioned
not
sure
if
its
a
good
or
bad
thing
either
way
its
an
easy
drinking
ale
thin
mid
palate
leads
into
a
flavorful
finish
pecan
shows
nicely
on
the
finish
and
is
very
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
dried
berries
arent
to
be
found
as
the
nose
suggested
but
there
is
a
tine
bit
of
praline
nearly
bone
dry
with
what
id
suspect
to
be
less
than
1
rs
an
easy
drinker
that
impressed
more
than
i
though
it
would
as
is
this
is
a
run
of
mill
ale
with
some
very
interesting
pecan
undertones
but
i
think
it
could
be
much
more
a
rather
straightforward
brown
with
less
pecan
nuttiness
than
i
had
hoped
for
regardless
its
a
drinkable
brew
that
would
be
a
sessionable
choice
for
a
fall
seasonable
worth
a
look
especially
as
an
alternative
for
the
tsunami
of
pumpkin
beers
that
are
flooding
the
shelves
recommended¬Ö
as
far
as
browns
go
its
pretty
good
no
real
pecan
feel
or
flavor
in
this
one
maybe
i
was
expecting
too
much
i
think
the
six
i
purchased
will
quench
my
thirst
of
this
one
but
i
dont
think
i
will
revisit
this
one
after
that
this
beer
poured
a
burnt
orangebrown
color
with
a
thick
head
¬ñ
tight
bubbles
it
had
an
initially
sweet
smell
with
a
bouquet
of
nuts
in
the
background
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
with
the
nut
flavor
apparent
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
also
the
carbonation
is
quite
noticeable
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
it
leaves
no
doubt
it
is
an
abita
i
grew
up
in
the
area
and
there
is
just
something
in
their
beer
that
is
common
to
them
all
¬ñ
you
know
it
is
theirs
drinkability
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
it
was
way
too
close
to
their
abita
amber
though
so
i
wasnt
impressed
that
much
they
should
have
down
a
pumpkin
beer
instead
if
it
was
anything
like
the
strawberry
harvest
it
would
have
rocked
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
a
little
too
light
on
the
palate
for
my
taste
just
feels
like
tonic
water
on
the
flat
side
leaves
a
slick
feeling
on
the
tongue
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
however
ill
probably
not
be
buying
this
one
again
it
doesnt
stand
out
nothing
special
about
it
sure
id
drink
one
but
i
dont
think
that
id
pay
for
a
pint
of
this
a
new
find
in
the
central
kentucky
region
although
catagoried
as
a
pecan
ale
brown
ale
the
lable
calls
this
brew
the
pecan
harvest
and
is
probably
more
accurately
placed
in
the
fruit
vegitable
catagory
the
beer
opens
with
medium
intensity
amber
ale
notes
with
perhaps
a
more
pronounced
emphasis
on
rich
nutty
character
and
a
hint
of
butter
pecan
the
look
is
a
bright
golden
copper
color
that
lands
on
the
brown
side
of
balance
tastes
also
very
amber
aleish
with
the
same
mild
hint
of
buttery
nuts
lightly
hopped
and
moderately
malted
the
beer
lacks
to
standout
with
any
distinguishable
qualities
feels
a
touch
light
on
the
palate
leaving
way
for
a
mild
astingency
to
come
through
may
come
from
nut
flavor
additions
light
diacityl
on
the
toung
with
a
light
buttery
note
finishes
with
an
increasing
bitter
bite
and
a
medium
sweet
feel
not
bad
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
pecan
flavor
and
character
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
it
has
a
nice
flavor
but
is
not
adventuresome
as
i
would
want
in
a
limited
beer
it
just
tastes
too
much
like
their
others
and
frankly
boring
worth
trying
though
its
just
ok
wouldnt
get
it
again
if
it
was
offered
to
me
at
a
friends
house
id
accept
if
there
wasnt
any
others
available
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
but
nothing
special
either
there
is
something
off
about
the
taste
that
i
dont
particularly
like
really
didnt
care
for
the
tobacco
notes
i
got
in
this
sweet
chocolate
aroma
nice
level
of
carbonation
this
has
a
sweet
chocolate
undertone
the
flavor
gives
way
to
a
nice
bread
like
finish
molasses
and
nut
flavors
never
really
cared
for
many
browns
at
all
this
is
good
good
flavor
good
substance
good
brown
goes
down
easily
best
brown
ale
i
have
ever
had
give
it
a
go
poured
a
dark
dark
brown
with
little
head
that
doesnt
last
long
and
leaves
no
lacing
smells
of
some
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
has
the
taste
of
some
sort
of
nut
hazelnut
possibly
but
goes
to
more
of
a
dark
chocolate
taste
as
you
drink
feel
is
nice
and
warm
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
decent
beer
nice
and
malty
drinkable
brown
ale
o
3
50
this
beer
had
a
pleasant
flavor
initially
but
somehow
it
faded
as
i
kept
going
losing
some
punch
that
in
addition
to
the
thin
mouthfeel
hurt
the
overall
scoring
a
bit
it
is
still
a
decent
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
am
not
seeking
it
out
either
spicy
and
hoppy
this
brown
ale
really
warmed
you
up
as
the
label
would
suggest
nice
dark
chocolate
and
fig
qualities
almost
christmasy
very
unique
in
its
flavor
balance
it
was
a
very
pretty
rich
amber
color
as
well
pretty
standard
brown
ale
nothing
spectacular
to
me
this
is
an
average
american
brown
ale
the
taste
hits
all
the
right
flavors
there
is
milk
chocolate
cocoa
and
light
tree
bark
the
taste
is
somewhere
between
bitter
and
sweet
as
neither
sensation
really
dominates
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
either
a
complex
and
sturdy
brown
ale
o
solid
strong
brown
ale
overall
this
is
a
very
very
good
brown
ale
great
roasty
nutty
flavors
balanced
beautifully
by
some
brown
sugarlike
sweetness
definitely
recommended
a
bit
nutty
tasting
and
slightly
sweet
i
dont
really
get
much
of
a
chocolate
flavor
despite
this
beer
being
brewed
with
chocolate
the
mouth
feel
is
surprising
light
overall
just
ok
if
there
is
snow
outside
your
home
then
relaxing
and
drinking
this
beer
makes
total
sense
to
this
guy
awesome
just
how
a
brown
ale
should
be
pours
a
very
deep
chocolate
brown
with
nice
head
that
quickly
diminishes
lacing
is
minimal
aroma
is
strong
of
malts
and
light
in
chocolate
taste
is
sweet
malty
with
touches
of
light
hops
and
roasted
coffee
mouthfeel
is
nice
cool
slightly
thick
going
down
overall
a
nicely
balanced
brown
ale
at
just
the
right
strength
and
feel
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
roastiness
to
the
flavors
really
nice
winter
beer
and
i
would
likely
grab
this
one
again
o
very
enjoyable
i
would
have
liked
the
hops
to
be
more
present
in
aroma
flavor
and
bitterness
very
tasty
beer
was
pleasantly
surprised
after
seeing
it
only
has
a
good
rating
nice
full
bodied
ale
chocolatey
light
roast
and
a
fairly
bitter
finish
on
the
sweet
side
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
coffee
character
theres
just
a
touch
of
acrid
notes
i
gotta
say
they
got
the
toastiness
of
this
brew
to
match
up
nicely
with
the
name
and
label
i
really
do
like
the
malts
here
but
something
spicy
and
fruity
from
the
yeast
clashes
just
a
bit
on
my
palate
chocolate
and
smoke
do
good
deeds
though
impressive
looks
too
overall
pretty
nice
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
brown
ale
another
good
brew
from
these
guys
this
is
better
than
expected
i
drank
an
imperial
stout
before
this
and
it
holds
up
in
the
flavor
department
dark
brown
in
color
with
minimal
light
penetrating
it
a
fingernail
of
beige
head
covers
the
majority
of
the
top
aroma
is
very
sweet
dark
malt
to
the
point
of
being
cloying
the
taste
is
overwhelmingly
sweet
dark
malt
with
a
lightsmoky
note
the
mouth
is
thick
and
oily
not
a
typical
brown
ale
by
any
stretch
of
imagination
a
solid
if
unspectacular
brown
ale
thick
chewy
roasted
and
sweet
more
of
a
oatmeal
stout
in
my
book
enjoyable
something
i
could
see
myself
drinking
slowly
sitting
next
to
a
warm
fireplace
overall
a
pretty
nice
toasty
brown
ale
good
roasty
malt
flavors
with
a
smooth
creamy
body
overall
a
very
flavorful
brown
ale
no
complaints

all

this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
available
its
more
of
a
winter
brown
with
the
roasted
notes
but
it
can
be
enjoyed
in
the
summer
too
i
would
drink
it
on
hot
days
but
warm
nights
by
the
fire
are
perfect
this
by
far
is
my
favorite
has
a
smooth
taste
and
easy
to
drink
i
tried
this
in
holland
mi
and
have
been
buying
this
one
ever
since
my
only
complaint
is
i
get
to
full
on
them
to
fast
if
you
want
a
great
beer
buy
this
one
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
keep
returning
to
it
o
a
good
winter
beer
for
warming
up
after
too
long
in
the
elements
goes
down
pretty
smooth
but
the
hotness
from
the
alcohol
can
fatigue
the

partial

brown
is
the

that

see
looking
for
this
one
in
the

does
this

not

i
love
brown
ales
and
this
one
is
very
nice
it
would
be
good
with
a
western
burger
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
it
doesnt
have
anything
that
separates
it
from
the
crowd
but
it
is
brewed
to
style
and
is
easily
drinkable
if
youre
looking
for
an
unoffensive
solid
brown
ale
then
this
is
it
if
youre
looking
for
something
more
you
should
look
elsewhere
im
glad
i
tried
it
once
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
overall

makes

brew
the
label
is
befitting
its
proper
setting
for
consumption
i
am
not
a
fan
of
raisins
per
se
but
i
can
be
persuaded
by
the
roasted
atmosphere
of
this
profile
this
is
the
only
bottle
i
purchasedi
built
my
own
winter
six
at
shopritebut
i
would
revisit
this
at
a
later
date
overall
a
rather
tasty
and
moderately
sweet
brown
ale
with
a
smooth
feel
and
a
good
drinkability
quite
a
nice
one
to
try
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brown
ale
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tried
in
a
whilethe
creamy
malt
flavor
isnt
exotic
by
any
means
but
works
so
well
hereits
not
overly
hoppy
or
bitter
just
balanced
superblythe
phrase
drinkable
doesnt
do
this
ale
justice
i
could
easily
drink
3
or
4
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
be
very
happythere
is
no
sign
of
the
6

abv
in
the
flavor
im
expecting
this
to
sneak
up
on
meabsolutely
nothing
missing
from
this
brew
i
couldnt
recommend
it
morego
get
a
six
pack
and
youll
thank
me
later55
big
thanks
goes
out
to
mississipping
and
staywhatyouare2s
dad
for
sharing
this
one
at
a
recent
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
redbrown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
nutty
toasted
malt
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
powdered
chocolate
milk
chocolate
and
nutty
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
had
never
heard
of
this
brew
before
until
i
saw
it
this
night
so
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
at
all
what
i
found
actually
wasnt
too
bad
for
the
style
a
lot
of
the
right
components
were
present
but
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
with
the
chocolate
aspect
going
on
in
the
flavor
to
stand
out
in
the
style
if
that
was
toned
back
slightly
it
could
have
been
a
pretty
good
brew
worth
your
time
trying
if
you
get
the
opportunity
to
do
so
i
think
this
could
be
a
session
beer
even
at
6
as
long
as
it
is
a
short
session
well
done
not
a
big
beer
at
all
though
hardy
enough
with
a
great
toasted
warm
malt
flavor
to
make
it
perfect
to
put
several
back
during
the
winter
months
a
very
under
rated
brewery
that
makes
another
solid
beer
something
i
would
recommend
fans
of
brown
ales
this
one
should
work
for
you
o
pretty
good
yet
different
for
its
style
i
prefer
bit
more
nuttycaramel
and
a
little
less
earthysmokeyness
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
say
an
ellies
brown
ale
overall
a
very
drinkable
yet
average
version
of
a
brown
ale
nothing
bad
about
it
but
not
as
good
as
i
usually
expect
from
new
holland
but
for
the
price
it
was
worth
it
and
a
good
brown
ale
to
pair
with
some
food
or
for
a
lazy
evening
solid
brown
ale
fairly
dry
throughout
overall
a
solid
soundly
malty
brown
ale
for
the
colder
months
o
id
buy
this
again
its
a
standard
of
what
a
brown
should
taste
like
c
smooth
slightly
drying
with
a
mild
warming
from
the
alcohol
bloom
medium
plus
body
with
light
gentle
effervescence
this
is
better
than
newcastle
for
certain
and
i
like
some
newk
that
being
said
this
is
a
nice
beer
just
not
something
id
like
to
have
everyday
o
overall
not
a
bad
brew
although
the
flavors
could
have
been
more
pronounced
id
have
again
o
overall
its
a
stand
up
brown
ale
it
wasnt
anything
totally
out
of
the
ordinary
but
its
pretty
damn
good
wouldnt
mind
having
another
but
i
only
had
one
o
brown
ale
closer
to
a
porter
which
works
for
me
good
news
it
doesnt
taste
like
cola
i
get
lightly
burnt
caramel
molases
and
nice
robust
malt
flavors
moderately
carbonated
and
a
medium
body
it
is
easy
to
drink
i
just
wish
it
was
a
better
experience
overall
pretty
good
brown
ale
here
sure
to
compliment
a
cold
winter
day
very
nicely
o
overall
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
but
definitely
a
good
beer
and
one
that
i
could
easily
drink
again
first
beer
by
new
holland
and
im
impressed
im
enjoying
this
quite
a
bit
and
i
really
dont
care
much
for
brown
ales
it
hides
a
bit
of
malty
alcohol
well
under
the
hops
not
too
sweet
it
might
be
nice
to
have
a
bunch
of
these
some
time
they
are
very
drinkable
and
i
would
buy
it
again
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
medium
sized
head
nice

low

well
rounded
balanced

throughout
great
medium
to
fullbodied
and
and
well
carbonated

overall
quite
pleasant
i
think
this
is
a
nice
wintery
brown
ale
usually
i
prefer
a
more
bitter
american
brown
but
i
like
this
still
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
brown
ale
would
be
a
good
cold
weather
beer
overall
a
touch
watery
overall
which
is
often
the
downfall
of
many
in
this
genre
not
very
memorable
or
unique
in
any
way
this
may
be
my
first
go
around
with
new
holland
i
enjoyed
this
and
will
look
for
other
offerings
from
new
holland
i
wish
there
were
a
bit
more
body
with
this
one
but
overall
pretty
good
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
no
head
or
lacing
its
aroma
is
nutty
with
caramel
and
spice
and
a
hint
of
toast
the
flavor
leads
with
mild
coffee
and
molasses
followed
by
cinnamon
coke
and
anise
notes
with
a
mild
hop
kick
as
it
warms
very
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
new

cabin
fever
brown
ale
is
a
good
brew
recommended
this
brown
pours
black
with
red
tints
all
around
a
modest
one
finger
head
not
a
strong
scent
but
it
matches
the
taste
rather
well
the
taste
of
this
brew
has
some
chocolate
notes
and
earthy
notes
caramel
flavor
and
feel
also
its
a
very
silky
felling
beer
and
a
relatively
easy
drinker
nothing
too
special
here
to
be
honest
but
worth
a
try
o
nice
offering
but
could
be
more
robust
good
for
a
couple
o
a
pretty
enjoyable
brown
ale
that
drinks
nicely
definitely
nice
to
see
something
a
little
different
for
a
winter
seasonal
this
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
good
flavors
just
lacks
the
mouthfeel
and
body
to
make
it
stand
out
good
o
overall
an
ok
flavor
it
seems
to
fit
the
parameters
of
requirements
per
style
but
just
didnt
seem
all
that
exciting
to
drink
a
bit
bigger
then
an
ideal
session
brown
but
not
quite
as
robust
as
a
big
brown
unlikely
revist
with
so
many
better
examples
available
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
cabin
fever
is
the
quintessential
winter
brown
i
am
fortunate
enough
to
get
it
at
the
brewery
however
in
a
bottle
is
pretty
close
to
the
tap
it
has
a
fantastic
malty
flavor
and
aroma
and
finishes
cleanly
with
a
great
malt
aftertaste
if
you
are
forced
to
drink
one
brown
ale
the
rest
of
your
life
this
would
be
a
fantastic
choice
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
might
not
adhere
to
a
specific
style
well
but
is
a
nice
in
between
of
a
more
roasty
porter
and
a
sweeter
brown
o
solid
but
a
bit
thin
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
dark
in
color
with
a
slight
tint
of
red
the
immediate
nose
of
the
beer
was
that
of
dark
dried
fruit
and
raisin
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
pretty
accurately
described
on
the
bottle
in
itself
that
is
somewhat
unusual
the
raisin
and
rye
flavors
are
very
evident
and
the
raisin
flavor
is
quite
tolerable
i
was
concerned
that
the
flavors
would
bring
a
grainy
sensation
but
this
was
not
the
case
the
flavors
changed
in
the
aftertaste
to
a
molasses
and
slightly
nutty
flavor
as
a
brown
ale
it
is
smooth
with
certain
mild
hints
of
sourness
i
heard
some
negative
and
positive
things
about
this
beer
so
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
o
i
dont
know
if
the
keg
was
almost
gone
but
this
beer
wasnt
even
close
to
how
good
it
was
in
a
bottle
the
aromas
dont
set
you
up
for
how
complex
this
brew
is
it
starts
off
almost
like
a
chocolate
bock
but
then
the
roasted
and
smoked
malt
sneak
in
with
a
touch
of
dark
caramel
the
liberal
use
of
rye
adds
nice
texture
and
flavor
the
hops
round
out
the
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
strong
earthiness
and
the
lacing
is
like
a
coat
of
snow
on
top
of
a
cabin
deep
in
the
woods
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
and
solid
american
brown
ale
this
brown
ale
had
much
more
roast
then
most
brown
ales
which
made
it
more
fitting
for
its
winter
release
but
i
feel
like
some
additional
hops
in
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
would
help
make
this
beer
more
balanced
and
less
one
note
this
beer
has
good
drinkability
i
could
drink
two
or
three
of
these
in
a
sitting
it
went
down
smooth
and
had
enough
flavor
to
hold
my
attention
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
taste
this
beer
looked
real
nice
and
the
flavor
stuck
out
from
most
brown
ales
due
to
its
heavy
roast
which
i
liked
and
i
thought
was
fitting
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
lack
of
hops
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
it
needed
about
twice
as
much
hops
in
both
to
stand
up
to
all
those
roasty
malts
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
roasty
brown
ale
for
the
winter
season
i
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
its
not
the
most
complex
brown
ale
but
the
roast
lends
a
nice
flavor
that
makes
it
stick
out
a
little
i
was
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
and
i
think
it
is
a
pretty
fitting
american
brown
ale
for
those
cold
michigan
winter
nights
new
holland
comes
through
with
another
solid
beer
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
m
medium
body
with
a
creamy
texture
sweet
to
bitter
with
a
dry
finish
nice
characters
nice
brown
with
good
character
another
michigan
beer
lets
see
how
this
american
brown
weighs
in
with
my
favorites
pours
a
very
nice
velvet
texture
with
a
brown
ruby
highlighted
huee
with
a
big
khaki
tan
head
forming
thick
fine
speckled
lacing
scattered
sporadically
aroma
has
a
nice
fruity
roasted
malt
character
going
on
slightly
nutty
with
some
hints
of
dark
chocolate
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
both
the
nose
and
the
palate
flavor
is
a
bit
astringent
with
alcohol
and
dark
roasted
malts
bring
out
a
hint
of
raisin
and
mild
dark
chocolate
notes
finishes
dry
with
some
herbal
hop
finish
maybe
a
hint
of
pine
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
with
a
fittingly
dry
finish
not
overly
sweet
enough
hops
and
alcohol
to
balance
out
the
malt
sweetness
overall
maybe
one
of
the
better
beers
out
of
their
seasonals
up
in
new
holland
im
typically
not
crazy
about
their
beers
but
this
isnt
half
bad
overall
impression
expected
more
from
this
beer
but
its
a
hit
or
miss
from
new
holland
i
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
their
mad
hatter
series
black
rye
double
etc
but
a
very
good
brown
ale
here
would
not
steer
anyone
from
this
one
but
i
will
be
venturing
out
and
enjoying
many
more
brown
ales
to
come
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
there
are
lots
of
flavors
and
i
really
enjoy
the
smoothness
of
it
as
well
it
pretty
to
look
at
but
for
me
lacked
in
the
aroma
department
i
would
buy
this
again
i
ended
up
liking
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
after
the
look
and
smell
the
sweetness
ends
just
before
becoming
cloying
with
the
roasty
notes
and
hops
providing
a
good
balance
o
this
has
good
drinkability
the
flavor
is
really
nice
and
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
nie
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
recommend
trying
this
one
out
i
would
buy
it
again
o
overall
its
a
bit
better
than
average
i
felt
that
the
smell
was
lacking
and
ive
had
a
lot
of
other
brown
ales
american
or
not
that
have
more
flavor
it
still
tastes
very
good
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
as
my
go
to
for
brown
ales
growler
fill
from
gbx
dark
mahogany
rich
brown
color
with
a
small
1
finger
off
whitetan
head
spotty
lacing
at
best
very
small
on
the
nose
with
some
carmel
notes
and
a
little
nutty
was
wanting
a
bigger
hit
with
the
aroma
taste
was
similar
to
the
nose
but
this
is
where
it
came
up
a
little
short
does
not
have
that
complex
brown
malty
nutty
taste
i
like
in
a
aba
it
does
go
down
smooth
for
6
abv
but
a
little
weak
on
the
taste
feel
is
okay
for
a
brown
a
bit
of
cream
and
some
carbonation
with
a
very
small
sting
of
hops
on
the
tongue
overall
not
a
bad
brown
but
not
spectacular
like
how
smooth
it
is
and
the
limited
hops
profile
was
wanting
a
bigger
taste
and
more
complexity
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
just
okay
for
an
aba
overall
its
not
a
really
complex
beer
but
it
is
rich
worth
trying
d
excellent
winter
beer
very
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
a
cold
winters
night
well
worth
seeking
out
overall
i
like
this
one
its
a
decent
brown
that
as
the
name
says
hits
the
target
of
being
a
wintery
beer
the
roast
notes
are
prevalent
but
not
overpowering
and
the
spicing
steers
away
from
the
warmer
category
as
well
as
the
sugary
sweetness
of
a
baked
good
more
of
a
sweetened
bread
than
a
gingerbread
man
as
far
as
the
season
goes
so
so
not
fantastic
and
certainly
not
the
best
from
new
holland
but
not
totally
disappointing
either
hurt
mostly
by
its
bland
taste
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
at
it
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
in
the
future
either
o
this
is
very
boring
i
wish
id
bought
a
newcastle
instead
and
yes
i
mean
that
this
beer
brings
nothing
to
the
table
and
will
be
forgotten
o
not
bad
basically
a
higher
alcohol
brown
ale
for
the
winter
season
appearance
was
descent
nose
and
taste
were
a
bit
mild
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
creamy
with
a
subtle
carbonation
cabin
fever
is
a
simple
easy
drinking
brew
that
you
can
stick
with
all
night
its
nothing
to
slouch
at
but
there
are
better
browns
out
there
well
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
overall
a
good
beer
not
one
i
will
revisit
often
but
enjoyable
overall
i
am
not
sure
exactly
what
to
make
of
this
beer
it
has
a
few
nice
flavors
but
with
each
sip
i
like
it
a
little
bit
less
off
flavor
o
a
nicely
balanced
brew
shows
some
dryness
on
the
finish
which
i
always
like
overall
a
smooth
decadent
beer
that
is
perfect
for
a
cold
night
overall
pretty
much
as
expected
for
a
brown
ale
that
has
an
elevated
alcohol
content
however
the
finishing
hops
dont
mesh
with
the
malts
and
the
medicinal
aftertaste
is
a
major
issue
decent
a
very
full
bodied
and
flavorful
brwon
ale
i
would
definitely
buy
again
not
a
favorite
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
o
pretty
good
but
not
great
in
any
regard
i
remember
not
liking
this
the
first
time
i
tried
it
but
its
growing
on
me
still
i
can
think
of
a
half
dozen
other
examples
of
the
style
i
would
pick
over
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
color
the
head
is
absolutely
none
existent
the
aroma
is
of
molasses
nougat
and
toffee
the
taste
is
of
dull
caramel
with
some
not
so
pleasant
astringency
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
almost
no
carbonation
and
a
oily
texture
overall
this
is
a
disappointing
beer
a
very
good
drinking
experience
with
a
deep
nutty
and
malty
flavor
and
a
great
frothy
mouthfeel
like
many
new
holland
beers
it
starts
out
muted
and
then
delivers
more
action
the
farther
in
you
get
typical
new
holland
gravity
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
porter
not
entirely
sure
new
holland
hit
the
mark
in
making
a
brown
ale
no
matter
a
really
good
beer
and
since
some
of
the
nh
beers
ive
had
of
late
have
been
a
bit
blase
a
good
turn
for
nh
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
bland
this
really
isnt
very
good
there
was
no
head
to
speak
of
little
to
no
carbonation
a
sour
taste
and
thin
watery
feeling
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
it
had
some
nice
looking
red
highlights
in
there
the
head
was
tan
and
had
a
pretty
good
retention
to
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
spiciness
to
it
along
with
a
soft
roasted
aroma
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
like
brown
sugar
upfront
that
fades
into
a
spicy
aftertaste
with
some
nutty
fruit
flavors
mixed
in
the
mouthfeel
was
moderate
nothing
too
heavy
or
too
light
there
was
a
good
carbonation
to
the
beer
as
well
overall
i
find
this
beer
to
be
pretty
good
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
pours
a
very
dark
mahogoney
with
a
fairly
slight
head
smells
rich
and
chocolatey
with
some
nice
raisiny
notes
and
malt
without
being
overly
sweet
tastes
even
a
bit
better
deeply
satisfying
with
notes
of
bitter
chocolate
toasty
malt
and
a
nice
bitter
almost
tannic
finish
fairly
full
in
the
mouth
but
both
creamy
and
snappy
i
wasnt
expecting
all
that
much
a
delicious
surprise
the
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
has
held
up
well
for
being
two
years
old
and
only
6
0
ish
abv
i
bet
it
is
cleaner
fresh
but
still
enjoy
this
aged
version
too
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
like
a
porter
offblack
with
a
tan
collar
and
light
carbonation
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
light
roast
coffee
and
milk
chocolate
sweet
caramel
licorice
and
a
dash
of
aged
malt
wellintegrated
and
refined
but
its
downhill
from
here
tastes
roasty
lactic
and
acidic
with
coffee
and
a
bit
of
hops
the
roast
and
the
acid
clash
quite
offensively
and
it
ends
bitter
thin
body
moderate
carbonation
and
short
finish
this
is
very
hard
to
drink
it
looked
and
smelled
so
good
but
it
ended
up
in
the
drain
i
would
love
to
try
a
proper
one
o
overall
this
was
a
pretty
bad
beer
far
too
acidic
and
no
real
brown
ale
flavors
to
it
drinks
real
nice
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
with
a
hearty
wellbalanced
meal
turkey
with
gravy
dark
green
vegetable
perhaps
sweet
potato
and
a
big
hunk
of
crusty
bread
this
is
a
rich
and
heavy
brown
beer
that
is
well
labeled
the
snowed
in
cabin
on
the
label
really
fits
this
beer
it
has
a
rich
and
heavy
character
and
strong
caramel
flavor
that
fits
nice
on
a
cold
evening
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
certainly
wouldnt
pick
it
up
in
the
summer
the
color
is
a
dynamic
mahogany
with
a
half
finger
head
and
a
creamy
finish
the
smell
is
sweet
and
the
sweetness
carries
through
in
the
rich
flavor
feels
great
on
the
pallet
and
drinks
very
smooth
poured
vigorously
to
form
a
tall
tan
head
that
lingered
for
awhile
till
subsiding
to
cover
a
mahogany
brew
some
lacing
grains
caramel
and
touch
of
rye
spiciness
in
the
aroma
initial
light
smoke
followed
by
caramelraisin
sweetness
and
roasted
grain
flavor
finishes
with
a
slightly
acidic
blended
bitterness
and
a
short
duration
of
dryness
medium
body
nice
texture
soft
carbonation
create
a
pleasant
experience
drinkability
im
sorry
but
between
the
smell
and
taste
unbalanced
strong
in
alcohol
and
malts
but
not
hops
i
would
have
to
rate
this
low
now
im
no
hophead
and
i
prefer
maltier
beers
but
something
about
this
one
is
just
off
after
a
while
youll
wonder
if
theres
ever
an
end
to
the
sweetness
the
aftertaste
that
lingers
just
reminds
me
of
how
disappointing
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
is
it
makes
me
not
want
to
have
any
more
i
will
probably
pass
on
this
one
if
i
see
it
again
too
bad
because
i
really
like
brown
ales
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
roast
and
some
faint
spices
in
the
taste
spices
cinnamon
stands
out
and
a
small
roast
a
spice
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
spice
and
malt
in
the
aftertaste
just
a
mellow
brown
ale
with
some
spices
drinks
okay
a
bit
too
sweet
with
some
aspects
not
quite
meshing
particularly
well
not
bad
not
great
kind
of
forgettable
but
not
one
id
turn
down
either
from
winter
brew
tasting
notes
2010
this
brown
ale
poured
an
almost
black
colour
with
a
big
creamy
tan
coloured
head
to
the
nose
there
are
scents
of
molassass
ripe
fruit
coffee
and
roasty
caramel
first
swig
was
full
flavoured
with
a
slightly
burnt
sweet
malt
flavour
nutty
molassass
and
slightly
sweet
finish
was
roasty
with
sweet
roasted
malt
flavours
lasting
but
something
was
lacking
from
this
brown
ale
the
flavor
isnt
quite
complete
in
my
opinion
but
the
beer
is
still
pretty
good
the
flavor
isnt
very
complex
and
all
other
aspects
are
relatively
average
worth
a
look
but
i
doubt
there
will
be
many
repeat
buyers
d
this
was
not
an
impressive
beer
none
of
the
scent
or
flavor
elements
were
very
good
the
body
was
ok
but
drinkability
suffered
from
my
lack
of
general
interest
in
finishing
the
beer
there
are
much
better
brown
ales
and
winter
seasonals
out
there
not
recommended
medium
bodied
and
not
very
robust
or
roasty
with
sweet
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
rye
and
toffee
sweeter
than
expected
with
dark
fruit
notes
notably
raisin
plum
and
grape
pass
medium
body
with
a
great
creamy
feel
lower
carbonation
pretty
easy
to
drink
although
i
think
the
spicy
and
earthyness
detracts
a
bit
for
me
dark
brown
wamber
highlights
beige
one
finger
head
smells
of
caramel
with
some
dried
fruit
a
little
scared
of
the
metalic
smell
sweet
up
front
with
some
dryness
in
the
finish
glad
to
see
no
metalic
taste
what
so
ever
tastes
of
dryfruit
coffee
tofee
and
chocolate
roasty
malts
with
a
mild
smoke
not
unlike
some
porters
carbonation
is
adaquate
surprisingly
light
to
med
body
after
a
bad
experience
w
new
hollands
ichabod
the
brewery
has
redeemed
themselves
with
this
one
in
my
opinion
i
could
see
this
easily
being
the
brown
that
i
compare
all
other
browns
to
2
5
d
ill
pass
on
this
if
i
ever
see
it
again
plenty
of
problems
without
a
lot
done
right
a
nice
example
of
the
style
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
unless
it
was
on
cask
i
bet
this
would
taste
fantastic
on
cask
despite
this
being
a
bit
of
a
hohum
brown
it
is
very
drinkable
and
i
felt
it
was
quite
solid
while
i
can
understand
some
wanting
something
more
robust
or
not
enjoying
the
buttery
aspect
of
the
beer
to
me
it
was
a
well
made
offering
d
i
dont
find
anything
objectionable
about
this
beer
but
nor
do
i
find
anything
special
about
it
it
doesnt
sate
my
thirst
for
beer
it
just
leaves
me
wanting
a
good
brown
ale
or
stout
or
porter
or
really
anything
to
round
out
the
flavor
black
body
with
red
edges
with
very
little
offwhite
head
sweet
aroma
of
chocolate
cream
slight
roast
butter
notes
chocolate
roast
diacetyl
some
cola
and
slight
gingerbread
medium
carbonation
and
body
a
sweet
brew
with
some
roast
characteristics
d
pretty
damn
tasty
and
probably
the
first
brown
ale
i
have
truly
enjoyed
to
my
palate
it
is
like
a
stout
lite
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
a
solid
as
expected
body
to
this
brew
somewhere
past
medium
but
not
quite
as
thick
as
a
stout
crosses
over
into
the
realms
of
a
porter
the
maltstohops
ratio
with
the
malts
as
the
victor
renders
this
a
highly
drinkable
option
and
for
sure
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
while
my
wife
imbibes
hot
cocoa
in
a
cabin
in
the
woods
surrounded
by
the
stark
cold
of
winter
cheers
this
beer
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
with
a
very
small
amount
of
off
white
head
the
smell
is
quite
good
consisting
of
lightly
roasted
malt
primarily
with
a
nice
breadiness
as
well
the
taste
is
also
of
roasted
malts
and
light
bread
flavors
but
with
a
very
faint
citrus
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
not
too
light
for
the
style
this
quite
a
drinkable
beverage
especially
in
the
winter
season
overall
i
find
this
quite
an
enjoyable
drink
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
ale
i
definitely
give
two
schlitz
about
cabin
fever
drinkability
yes
i
can
sit
by
the
fire
all
night
in
my
cabin
sipping
these
it
is
not
a
remarkable
beer
but
is
a
very
fine
example
of
a
brown
ale
d
well
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
some
said
a
definite
sipper
but
kind
of
a
weird
offering
from
new
holland
if
i
were
this
company
i
would
add
spices
and
call
it
a
winter
warmer
than
an
old
ale
brown
ale
solid
beer
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
but
this
is
not
one
ill
turn
down
if
offered
it
again
drinkability
drinkable
with
a
smile
poured
into
a
standard
pint
a
medium
to
dark
brown
with
a
weel
defined
half
finger
head
that
held
wellaromas
i
picked
up
were
some
light
brown
sugar
and
a
tinge
of
roast
flavors
started
out
with
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
brown
sugar
but
a
sour
note
came
out
of
nowhere
and
hijacked
the
palatereally
an
unpleasant
finish
to
a
nice
start
i
always
hope
to
really
like
beer
from
the
breweries
i
came
to
enjoy
as
a
craft
beer
novicemost
of
wich
are
from
michiganbut
this
just
wasnt
that
great
cabin
fever
ale
is
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
however
it
is
a
solid
offering
from
new
holland
sure
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
the
style
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
lingering
toasted
character
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasing
brown
ale
a
brown
ale
for
your
holiday
seasonal
a
gutsy
move
by
a
brewer
competing
against
a
sea
of
hoppedup
spicedup
roastedup
warmers
and
strong
ales
overall
a
worthy
contender
nice
roasted
malt
with
big
flavor
but
not
beyond
the
style
hops
stand
out
enough
to
qualify
for
listing
in
the
americanized
incarnation
of
the
brown
ale
overall
a
nicely
substantial
example
of
the
style
the
brown
ale
poured
to
an
almost
black
color
with
a
fullscale
creamy
tan
head
there
are
scents
of
roasted
malts
molasses
ripe
fruit
coffee
and
caramel
first
drink
was
full
flavored
with
a
slightly
burnt
sweet
malt
flavor
it
is
nutty
and
slightly
sweet
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
fresh
mouthfeel
was
very
big
especially
for
a
brown
ale
if
i
were
to
have
this
blindfolded
i
might
even
think
this
was
a
porter
huge
brown
ale
that
would
definately
be
classified
as
a
sipper
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
could
easily
down
it
or
just
sip
on
it
seems
to
be
a
versatile
beer
when
it
comes
to
how
you
drink
it
a
few
reviewers
said
they
could
taste
the
alcohol
in
it
and
gave
drinkability
a
lower
grade
than
i
did
since
i
couldnt
taste
the
alcohol
very
well
i
know
it
is
there
since
it
is
6
0
abv
according
to
the
bottle
i
did
say
the
taste
was
balanced
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
and
you
can
easily
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
drinkability
noticeable
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
limits
its
drinkability
somewhat
definitely
a
sipper
its
not
a
bad
effort
just
seems
to
be
missing
too
many
pieces
for
a
really
good
brown
ale
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
brown
ale
d
drinkability
was
good
not
really
what
i
would
expect
from
a
brown
ale
though
very
warming
pours
a
moderate
caramelbrown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
and
not
really
any
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
nice
with
a
good
dose
of
chocolate
malt
as
well
as
some

flavor
is
a
bit
toasty
with
some
caramel
and
bread
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
very
slight
roast
character
drinks
pretty
well
a
nice
fall
sipper
a
very
good
beer
to
drink
in
front
of
the
fire
or
the
tv
or
the
computer
or
d
this
was
a
ok
beer
that
seemed
like
i
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
to
drink
nice
try
for
new
holland
but
a
miss
in
the
books
for
the
time
that
i
tried
it
nothing
really
bad
about
it
but
the
aroma
was
muted
and
the
flavor
was
so
so
at
best
cheers
from
new
jersey
definitely
a
nice
winter
warmer
and
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
a
bonfire
and
a
cigar
on
a
cold
night
md
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
buit
one
dimensional
and
that
is
the
roasted

this
was
the
the

cant
really
find
any

with
the

nice

a

more

than
expected
d
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
new

ive
tried
will
definitely
have
another
one
soon
d
very
drinkable
d
i
would
say
the
drinkability
is
there
but
more
than
two
of
these
and
it
might
start
getting
too
sweet
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
the
flavors
work
well
together
pours
a
deep
rich
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored

that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
is

jockeys
for

with
a
sweetness
of

at
first
glance
the
beer
looks
very
porter
like
not
at
all
what
youd
expect
from
brown
ale
taste
is
rather
nutty
and
earthy
like
perhaps
chewing
on
a
hickory
branch
but
also
ha
s
a
sweet
sugar
taste
that
blends
in
nicely
and
smoothes
the
earthiness
lingering
taste
of
a
bit
of
floral
from
the
hops
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
and
a
general
sweetness
not
expected
from
brown
ale
finishes
nice
and
crisp
not
at
all
like
what
you
would
expect
from
such
a
high
abv
a
pleasure
very
much
d
with
an
abv
of
6
5
this
is
sort
of
like
an
imperial
brown
if
there
is
such
a
thing
and
as
such
its
got
some
great
things
going
for
it
this
is
a
bit
too
sugarysyrupy
imo
and
would
benefit
from
maybe
a
little
less
chocolateandsugar
notes
the
finish
and
lingering
notes
however
are
excellent
and
despite
a
notsodrinkable
sugaryness
this
is
still
a
great
beer
thanks
to

overall
simple
clean
nothing
complex
d
pretty
well
done
too
many
brown
ales
are
onedimensional
so
i
always
love
finding
takes
that
add
some
depth
to
the
style
this
one
has
some
nice
complexity
while
still
retaining
the
high
level
of
drinkability
that
a
brown
should
have
a
nice
malty

with
mild
roast
and
light

new
holland
has
yet
another
nice
offering
here
d
high
but
filling
a
brown
ale
that
explodes
with
flavor
this
beer
is
not
to
be
missed
a
perfect
winter
beer
pretty
good
drinkability
not
as
complex
as
i
would
like
but
would
buy
again
d
very
enjoyable
alcohol
is
a
bit
strong
for
anything
more
than
a
small
quantity
d
an
interesting
offering
from
new
holland
seems
a
bit
like
a
barleywine
blended
with
a
lighter
brown
ale
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
hot
for
something
i
would
expect
to
be
very
subdued
not
something
i
would
be
prone
to
pick
up
again
but
fun
to
try
opening
the
bottle
released
a
yeasty
aroma
the
beer
poured
very
nicely
with
a
moderate
foamy
head
the
beer
is
a
deep
red
color
with
very
little
cloudiness
even
after
pouring
the
aroma
remains
a
bit
yeasty
but
this
aroma
had
a
minimal
impact
on
the
taste
the
malt
flavor
is
strongest
accented
by
mild
hops
just
about
right
for
a
brown
ale
the
malt
is
a
bit
chocolatey
overall
the
taste
is
on
the
bitter
side
the
feel
in
the
mouth
is
quite
bubbly
deep
mahogany
body
topped
by
a
laterising
parchment
colored
head
the
head
didnt
form
until
well
after
the
bottle
was
emptied
it
then
quickly
fades
to
little
more
than
a
few
scattered
large
bubbles
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
aroma
is
almost
all
malt
heavy
on
the
molasses
and
brown
sugar
a
touch
of
fresh
bread
in
there
a
swell
just
a
hint
at
herbal
hop
aromas
intermingled
with
all
the
sweetness
flavor
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
blackstrap
molasses
caramelized
sugars
a
touch
of
anise
the
bitterness
is
almost
disguised
as
carbonation
almost
like
carbonic
acid
rather
than
hop
bitterness
but
in
the
age
of
the
overthetop
ipa
which
i
love
this
is
a
great
break
from
what
has
become
the
norm
to
some
of
us
each
successive
sip
reveal
more
layers
of
malt
and
sugar
tastes
like
a
really
hearty
beer
a
little
more
body
would
have
been
great
but
at
cellar
temps
it
may
have
gotten
cloying
if
it
had
more
presence
in
the
body
drinkability
is
very
good
if
you
like
malt
a
very
nice
offering
notes
really
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
beer
from
new
holland
and
they
show
again
a
great
understanding
of
yet
another
beer
style
bravo
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
to
quaff
beer
but
is
not
refreshing
as
some
other
brown
ales
worth
picking
this
up
for
a
cold
winter
day
d
tasty
beer
not
filling
very
smooth
and
goes
down
dangerously
easy
this
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
that
ive
had
d
slightly
warming
nice
for
a
cold
winter
night
o
its
a
brown
ale
for
sure
but
its
a
complete
miss
for
me
drinkability
is
ok
given
that
its
not
too
filling
but
i
wouldnt
ever
seek
it
out
again
i
dont
see
how
this
really
qualifies
as
a
winter
warmer
the
first
real
disappointment
from
new
holland
for
me
but
hey
we
cant
all
be
perfect
right
mouthfeel
is
creamy
drinkability
is
high
i
dont
taste
much
alcohol
and
it
tastes
pretty
good
kind
of
like
a
stout
meeting
a
winter
warmer
im
enjoying
this
one
alot
maybe
its
the
fact
that
its
20
out
and
snowing
but
this
is
making
my
night
a
warming
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
with
some
christmas
deserts
and
a
warm
fire
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
or
exception
here
but
a
solid
brew
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
thin
but
solid
tanbrown
head
the
nose
is
very
apparent
and
is
a
mix
of
caramel
chocolate
burnt
sugar
and
maybe
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
similar
but
has
more
black
patent
in
it
than
i
had
anticipated
the
taste
is
slightly
acrid
as
a
result
burnt
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
and
molasses
are
present
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
thin
but
slightly
viscous
carbonation
and
a
dry
alcoholwarming
finish
overall
a
drinkable
beer
definitely
excellent
for
a
cold
winters
night
rich
malty
and
tasty
with
no
alcohol
bite
to
be
found
man
was
this
a
good
brew
on
tap
i
look
forward
to
another
pull
of
this
bad
boy
cabin
fever
is
brown
in
color
with
red
high
lights
a
half
inch
tan
head
doesnt
last
long
it
has
a
very
sweet
malty
aroma
and
oddly
i
get
alcohol
too
even
though
it
is
only
6
25
abv
the
taste
is
very
sweet
chocolate
covered
caramels
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
but
oily
with
adequate
carbonation
i
found
fever
a
little
rich
to
be
highly
drinkable
but
the
abv
was
certainly
low
enough
it
was
almost
too
sweet
but
i
really
enjoyed
cabin
fever
and
definitely
plan
on
picking
up
a
few
more
a
shame
that
it
doesnt
appear
to
be
a
good
candidate
for
cellaring
drinkability
is
ok
just
for
the
fact
the
beer
was
just
too
damn
sweet
d
i
dont
know
how
much
of
this
stuff
i
would
want
to
drink
in
quantity
but
i
am
somewhat
enjoying
the
one
i
have
in
front
of
me
now
i
have
friends
that
i
am
sure
would
love
it
i
can
think
of
so
many
other
brown
ales
i
would
much
rather
have
this
was
a
major
disappointment
and
almost
a
drainpour
its
going
to
be
some
time
before
i
give
this
seasonal
another
chance

overall
if
they
toned

upside

love
the

to

thus

in

experiences
with
their
beers
particularly
their

it
came
through
in
this
one
as
well
has

it

chocolate
mild
coffee
and
a
tart
dark
fruit
prune
black
cherry
presence
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
carmel
and
earth
interesting
dark
fruit
prsesence
in
the
rear
prunes
dark
cherry
slightly
tart
finnish
good
medium

chewey
and
earthy
good
brown
ale
with
just
enough
to
diferentiaite
itself
the
finish
also
had
a
pungent
sourness
from
the
cherry
and
blackberry
scents
that
drowned
everything
else
out
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
if
this
was
the
way
it
was
intended
to
be
let
me
first
say
that
i
applaud
new
holland
for
taking
a
normal
brown
ale
base
and
aspiring
to
create
a
cherry
porter
but
at
least
forewarn
me
dont
drink
and
review
this
isnt
my
favorite
brown
ale
but
it
is
a
good
one
d
skip
this
one
and
seek
out
new
hollands
mad
hatter
or
poet
if
you
want
a
better
idea
of
what
this
brewery
is
capable
of
glad
i
went
with
the
single
first
for
sure
final
thought
it
may
have
been
a
bad
bottle
but
this
beer
has
the
right
ingredients
but
lacked
the
consistency
of
a
good
quality
brew
d
let
me
start
by
saying
that
i
like
this
beer
it
is
one
of
the
fullest
flavored
brown
ales
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
new
holland
scores
big
with
this
winter
seasonal
had
this
beer
with
dinner
stuffed
pepper
soup
it
poured
a
beautiful
rich
brownred
with
a
slight
foamy
light
tan
head
that
lasted
about
a
minute
smell
was
reminiscent
of
a
dry
red
wine
some
strong
fruity
esters
plum
and
raisin
come
to
mind
chocolate
undertones
it
is
quite
sweet
in
front
but
the
sweetness
fades
quickly
and
dries
in
the
mouthagain
much
like
a
cabernet
sauvignon
the
back
end
is
diacetyl
and
fairly
bitter
oddly
enough
i
had
some
fresh
parmesan
cheese
with
dinner
and
when
paired
with
the
cheese
the
beer
was
quite
nice
i
think
this
is
a
wine
the
drink
is
lightmedium
in
body
lightly
carbonated
totally
inoffensive
and
mellow
came
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
dark
copper
body
and
a
twofinger
white
head
that
was
foamy
but
quickly
left
a
dryer
roasted
malt
smell
with
some
sweet
malts
like
butterscotch
and
caramel
that
make
an
appearance
but
are
minor
not
really
a
significant
hop
presence
is
a
mediumboded
beer
that
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
this
one
just
didnt
grab
me
had
some
sweet
and
roasted
malts
mix
it
up
on
the
tongue
a
little
slick
but
nothing
amazing
finishes
clean
with
a
hint
of
dryness
and
thats
about
it
not
a
bland
beer
but
just
a
runofthemill
brown
to
be
honest
kind
of
shocked
new
holland
put
out
a
weak
beer
their
weak
is
still
miles
ahead
of
a
lot
of
other
breweries
but
if
you
really
want
a
brown
ale
and
theres
nothing
else
on
the
menu
then
go
for
this
i
have
no
idea
whats
going
on
with
this
stuff
way
too
much
buttery
diacetyl
yuck
really
an
interesting
brown
ale
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
overall
this
is
right
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
browns
theres
nothing
that
really
sticks
out
as
above
average
though
in
the
same
vein
nothing
sticks
out
as
less
than
average
worth
a
shot
if
youre
into
browns
very
dark
brown
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
malts
and
chocolate
taste
is
chocolate
and
smoky
malts
a
decent
beer
that
would
go
well
with
a
bbq
due
to
its
smoky
flavor
overall
pretty
good
and
something
that
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
d
too
sweet
to
be
really
drinkable
a
good
beer
none
the
less
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
deep
chocolate
brown
clear
with
a
thin
head
quickly
fading
smelled
nutty
slightly
burnt
this
carried
over
into
the
taste
of
burnt
nuts
and
burnt
sugar
flavors
thin
and
riding
an
over
abundance
of
carbonation
left
only
a
faint
aftertaste
of
malt
drinkable
and
appropriate
for
a
cold
michigan
weekend
afternoon
new
holland
is
a
better
brewery
than
cabin
fever
brown
ale
would
suggest
im
not
sure
what
went
astray
with
this
offering
diacetyl
most
likely
but
i
would
much
rather
stock
the
cabin
with
something
more
substantial
and
more
tasty
this
is
disappointing
beer
especially
considering
the
source
brown
ales
have
been
my
least
favorite
of
all
styles
but
this
could
be
the
first
one
i
actually
can
say
that
i
enjoyed
enough
to
get
a
six
of
aw
heck
maybe
a
case
drinkability
depends
on
your
constitution
lots
of
flavor
how
much
can
you
endure
drinkability
for
diacetyl
lovers
only
this
beer
just
has
a
lot
of
flaws
im
having
this
bottle
sidebyside
with
newcastle
brown
so
this
should
be
a
lot
of
fun
this
pours
a
much
darker
brown
than
newcastle
with
a
medium
tan
head
smells
of
darkened
toast
and
rosted
malts
very
nice
far
more
complex
taste
than
newcastle
this
beer
is
very
interesting
a
strong
roasted
bitterness
and
almost
sourness
or
tanginess
that
is
very
intriguing
bitter
coffee
finish
the
watery
body
is
its
biggest
flaw
but
this
is
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
enjoyable
aroma
had
vanilla
and
light
touch
of
butterscotch
color
is
deep
i
mean
deep
dark
brown
head
retention
was
reasonable
but
died
quickly
it
was
very
light
tan
and
thin
laced
texture
was
thick
and
hefty
like
taffy
id
further
say
the
quafibility
for
me
is
in
limited
doses
this
beer
is
great
for
the
vanilla
porter
and
sweet
stout
fans
out
there
has
just
enough
all
spice
to
remind
that
its
a
winter
beer
you
can
tell
its
the
same
guys
who
brew
red
tulip
and
dragons
milk
a
little
in
love
with
the
malts
boys
a
suitable
dark
winter
for
those
who
dont
enjoy
the
typical
winter
beers
its
fair
to
middlin
in
my
humble
opinion
as
are
most
new
hollands
too
sweet
and
overly
malty
with
no
counter
balance
of
dry
tones
that
gives
good
to
great
beers
their
complexity
cabin
fevers
an
okay
beer
but
it
is
a
little
disappointing
the
strong
carameltoffee
aspect
of
it
is
just
a
little
too
much
for
me
it
really
hinders
the
nose
theres
a
number
of
superior
brown
ales
that
are
much
more
desireable
its
worth
a
try
but
needs
some
work
drinkability
not
a
brew
that
i
would
actively
seek
out
or
even
reach
for
if
i
saw
it
on
the
table
many
more
winter
seasonals
that
appeal
to
my
palate
this
has
a
week
feel
of
alcohol
to
it
and
id
swear
it
would
make
a
good
session
had
i
not
seen
the
6
25
abv
i
dont
really
feel
any
toffee
in
this
like
some
others
do
but
instead
i
look
at
this
as
a
less
sticky
and
caramellike
version
of
newcastle
it
can
warm
ya
up
on
a
night
like
this
but
its
by
no
means
a
winter
warmer
instead
its
a
mellow
afterdinner
beer
perfect
for
those
who
just
want
to
mellow
out
and
not
think
about
what
theyre
drinking
a
quietly
solid
offering
from
new
holland
pousrs
mix
of
dark
garnet
and
brown
with
a
pretty
quick
head
and
some
small
sluggish
sporadic
bubbling
nutty
and
toffee
filled
aroma
with
just
a
bit
of
bitter
roasted
malt
very
nutty
and
full
of
toffee
wuth
maybe
a
splash
of
suagared
and
creamed
coffee
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
no
discernable
detection
of
hops
velvety
super
sweet
palate
wintery
sweet
yes
but
not
all
that
sessionable
although
the
flavors
are
good
and
they
dont
linger
too
long
i
really
enjoyed
this
brown
ale
from
new
holland
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
great
mouthfeel
almost
full
bodied
and
thick
and
chewy
and
slick
perfect
carbonation
perhaps
a
little
fruity
and
slightly
sweet
but
a
really
good
beer
i
am
usually
not
a
brown
fan
english
anyway
but
these
american
browns
are
starting
to
grow
on
me
my
first
beer
from
new
holland
was
also
my
first
brown
ale
in
quite
some
time
im
glad
i
got
both
those
things
tonight
and
will
probably
look
for
more
of
both
despite
being
underwhelmed
by
this
one
d
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
that
i
have
had
in
some
time
great
sweetness
and
nutty
flavors
dark
ruby
brown
body
just
a
skimming
of
brown
cream
on
the
surface
lace
is
minimal
aroma
is
thick
and
sweet
caramel
and
fudge
and
toffee
and
nougat
all
balled
into
one
taste
is
pretty
sticky
sweet
big
toffee
and
a
little
butterscotch
also
caramel
and
some
wet
cardboard
lingering
semblance
of
cloying
viscous
mouthfeel
with
cough
syrup
feel
to
it
it
turned
out
better
by
the
end
of
it
than
with
my
first
sip
but
still
very
average
eric
d
unusual
tasting
beer
not
too
heavy
not
bad
not
my
favorite
from
new
holland
but
a
well
crafted
beer
nonetheless
just
not
my
favorite
genre
i
would
say
this
is
one
is
average
it
is
tasty
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
but
the
flavors
didnt
feel
entirely
cohesive
impressive
effort
for
a
brown
ale
almost
a
session
beer
but
it
would
be
hard
to
only
have
one
nice
going
big
disappointment
the
worst
ive
had
from
new
holland
i
wont
ever
grab
this
again
avoid
d
this
is
a
likable
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
warming
quality
when
you
drink
it
a
good
beer
for
the
season
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
slightly
creamy
robust
flavors
one
of
my
favorite
new
holland
offerings
dits
a
drinkabile
beer
enjoyable
down
to
the
last
sip
but
nothing
that
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
as
far
as
american
browns
go
ill
probably
spend
my
money
on
a
different
brand
in
the
future
an
excellent
and
complex
blend
of
flavors
and
textures
but
the
viscous
chewy
mouthfeel
sometimes
slightly
cloying
sweetness
and
notsowellhidden
alcohol
presence
hinder
drinkability
despite
this
ales
downfall
as
a
session
beer
it
is
certainly
a
nice
rich
filler
for
a
cold
winters
night
an
intriguing
brown
ale
for
sure
from
the
pour
you
would
swear
you
were
looking
at
a
glass
of
coke
the
color
is
strikingly
similar
and
the
head
dissipates
to
a
colalike
set
of
bubbles
i
get
a
lot
of
butterscotch
on
the
nose
of
this
one
intermingled
with
some
slight
metallic
notes
and
definitely
some
brown
sugarmolasses
id
say
the
body
is
mediumheavy
and
the
carbonation
is
plentiful
perhaps
a
little
too
much
i
usually
think
of
brown
ales
as
having
a
smooth
mouth
feel
this
one
is
a
little
rough
given
the
amount
of
carbonation
the
flavor
is
quite
interesting
a
lot
more
complexity
than
your
average
english
brown
i
get
raisins
figs
molasses
toffee
plus
some
herbal
notes
that
mingle
together
pretty
dynamically
id
be
interested
to
know
what
yeasts
they
are
using
here
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
recent
trip
i
made
to
the
ommegang
brewery
in
ny
where
i
tasted
a
couple
beers
made
with
wild
yeasts
there
are
definitely
some
wild
estery
notes
in
this
brew
not
quite
sure
where
this
one
fits
categorically
but
its
an
interesting
beer
to
try
maybe
not
one
of
my
favs
but
certainly
worth
sampling
give
it
a
shot
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
clean
dark
malt
flavors
to
it
but
it
is
a
bit
thin
and
taste
a
bit
like
a
porter
that
was
diluted
with
water
the
tartness
was
a
bit
bold
for
the
rest
of
the
malt
flavors
and
it
would
be
nice
to
taste
some
other
flavors
besides
the
mineral
watery
notes
clean
looking
cola
color
that
is
to
say
not
demonstrating
those
sticky
bubbles
on
the
side
of
the
glass
that
most
colas
are
guilty
of
that
and
the
one
and
a
half
finger
head
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
apart
from
its
caramel
color
its
aroma
is
even
more
apparant
almost
butterscotchy
in
aroma
and
mixed
with
a
prety
decent
amout
of
grapefruity
hops
not
like
any
brown
ale
ive
ever
encountered
this
one
is
american
through
and
through
rich
roasted
caramel
malt
dominate
the
opening
and
everything
keeps
getting
sweeter
from
there
hops
seem
to
fall
of
a
little
bit
from
the
nose
beer
closes
overly
sweet
and
grainy
almost
cloying
would
be
almost
unbearable
if
not
for
the
soda
like
carbonation
that
keeps
the
beer
bubbling
just
above
the
tongue
not
something
id
really
want
to
reach
for
again
reminds
me
a
bit
of
atwaters
beers
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
the
rest
in
teh
12
pack
seemed
okay
just
a
bit
dissapointed
here
nothing
particularly
sensational
glad
i
only
got
two
to
sample
in
its
second
year
as
nhbcs
winter
seasonal
cabin
fever
is
a
strong
choice
among
many
winter
varieties
cabin
fever
is
preceded
by
ichabod
in
the
fall
zoomer
in
the
summer
and
red
tulip
in
the
spring
all
of
which
available
at
the
beverage
company
in
traverse
city
cabin
fever
is
rich
and
complex
just
what
a
winter
beer
should
be
so
before
you
reach
for
that
ordinary
and
ubiquitous
new
castle
brown
ale
too
not
sure
i
like
it
and
as
afore
mentioned
it
has
a
bit
of
a
warming
character
it
goes
down
real
easy
faint
vanilla
but
this
brown
ale
didnt
blow
my
socks
off
nice
color
but
clear
chestnut
brown
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
a
light
tan
head
makes
a
brief
appearance
smells
of
chocolate
waft
towards
my
nostrils
a
milksugar
sweetness

and

in

overall
an
excellent
brown

that
uses
hazelnut
as
well
as
any
beer
ive
had
should
be
available
yearround
in
six
packs
well
done
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
actually
very
pleasantly
surprised
drink
it
fresh
though
i
forgot
about
one
for
a
few
months
and
the
mineral
like
flavors
take
over
taste
is
toasty
caramellyearhty
up
front
with
hazel
soon
joining
the
hazelnut
is
firm
but
not
overpowering
its
pretty
balanced
and
his
toastybittersweet
finish
and
aftertaste
i
was
caught
completely
caught
off
guard
with
this
one
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
easy
to
drink
tasty
so
long
as
you
enjoy
hazelnut
and
a
super
smooth
body
make
this
a
fantastic
i
found
this
in
a
sampler
and
have
not
seen
it
in
its
own
sixer
which
is
a
bit
disappointing
this
deserves
a
slot
on
the
shelf
all
to
itself
at
this
point
i
should
probably
mention
the
enjoy
by
date
on
the
botte
is
january
im
reviewing
in
febuary
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
this
and
see
hw
much
better
it
will
be
brewery
fresh
what
i
really
liked
about
the
taste
was
its
subtle
bitterness
and
allout
hazelnut
character
relatively
sweet
and
mild
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
sam
adams
usually
does
it
right
wow
i
left
the
hazel
brown
for
the
last
beer
to
try
out
of
a
seasonal
pack
and
boy
am
i
glad
i
did
this
is
by
far
the
best
brew
from
sam
adams
to
date
that
i
have
tried
gorgeous
dark
caramel
color
with
hints
of
red
and
brown
the
smell
and
taste
matched
perfectly
a
distinct
odor
of
hazelnut
a
distant
taste
of
cedar
or
something
woodsy
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
making
it
go
down
faster
than
it
should
overall
it
was
more
than
outstanding
ill
have
to
go
out
and
order
a
specific
six
pack
of
this
stuff
to
enjoy
during
the
holidays
this
beer
was
one
of
the
better
offerings
in
the
sam
adams
harvest
collection
variety
pack
the
hazelnut
flavor
was
quite
pleasant
and
transformed
a
fairly
ordinary
brown
ale
into
something
interesting
and
enjoyable
at
least
the
alcohol
was
on
the
light
side
and
had
i
not
given
half
of
this
pack
away
i
probably
would
have
popped
open
the
other
in
my
sitting
the
aroma
was
the
best
aspect
of
this
but
the
sweetness
was
fleeting
and
this
beer
could
have
used
more
body
and
had
more
bite
to
it
on
a
quiet
fall
day
like
this
it
did
the
trick
and
was
worth
having
once
to
round
out
the
other
offerings
in
the
fall
pack
overall
nice
moderately
dark
malty
brew
i
thought
from
the
aroma
that
this
beer
would
be
much
richer
still
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
overall
it
something
different
from
the
average
brown
ale
the
body
isnt
thin
but
thinnish
on
the
smaller
end
of
medium
its
got
slightly
more
than
a
modicum
of
crispness
and
smoothness
overall
i
can
see
others
enjoying
this
beer
however
it
is
just
not
for
me
as
i
do
not
care
for
toffee
flavor
still
was
about
to
drink
without
a
problem

to

beer

when

i
believe
the
guests
would
appreciate
it
as
well
overall
i
think
it
is
an

offering
that
i
would
drink
again
but
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
summary
pretty
good
decent
pick
out
of
the
sam
adams
harvest
collection
had
with
bbq
chicken
beans
and
corn
a
very
mild
beer
with
a
fleeting
hazelnut
flavor
some
caramel
and
toffee
touch
of
bitterness
to
balance
lingering
sweetness
medium
body
that
thins
out
on
the
back
end
overall
pretty
lackluster
and
boring
but
its
nothing
offensive
i
think
its
time
for
sam
to
cut
back
on
the
amount
of
variety
in
their
variety
packs
and
stick
to
4
solid
styles
that
they
brew
overall
a
tasty
brew
very
unusual
and
pleasant
for
a
mass
producer
a
risk
taking
and
original
experience
some
might
find
the
hazel
nut
artificial
but
i
didnt
find
it
any
more
so
than
either
coffee
syrup
or
hazelnut
spreads
definitely
liked
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
with
a
twist
i
probably
wouldnt
get
a
sixpack
of
it
but
as
part
of
the
mixer
its
fine
solid
and
different
i
might
pick
up
more
of
these
the
verdict
good
beer
this
normally
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
its
a
good
smooth
beer
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
very
well
balanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hazelnut
o
mediocre
beer
starts
bad
finishes
just
ok
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
from
sam
adams
this
is
the
best
ive
had
from
them
in
awhile
possibly
ever
its
very
unique
and
is
hitting
on
all
cylinders
highly
recommended

i
enjoyed

it

was
not

i
did
enjoy
the
nutty
smell
and
taste
it
had
though

though
the
mouthfeel
mainly
the
carbonation
detracts
from

the

is
also
a

at
times
seems
artificial

is
an

it
has
a

o
the
taste
on
this
beer
definitely
would
benefit
being
paired
with
the
right
foods
not
really
a
stand
alone
beer
in
my
opinion
a
bit
tougher
to
just
drink
by
itself
could
easily
fit
in
with
the
right
dessert
pairing
sweeter
taste
with
a
strong
deep
roast
of
hazelnuts
a
bit
sweet
thin
bodied
and
high
in
the
carbonation
short
aftertaste
relatively
nondescript
overall
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
one
lots
of
good
autumn
flavors
coming
through
dark
amber
color
with
moderate
head
and
mild
carbonation
strong
toasted
caramel
toffee
malt
notes
with
a
heavy
hazelnut
aroma
very
savory
aroma
toasted
caramel
and
chocolate
taste
with
a
heavy
heavy
nuttiness
that
gives
way
to
a
little
bitterness
at
the
end
of
the
sip
not
well
balanced
or
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
are
good
but
its
a
special
situation
type
of
beer
its
nutty
to
the
max
and
the
nuttiness
overshadows
the
entire
rest
of
the
beer
would
have
gone
great
in
a
winter
pack
instead
of
an
autumn
pack
low
c
overall
solid
brown
ale
i
love
the
taste
of
the
cocoa
although
i
wish
there
was
more
hazelnut
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
current
fall
pack
flavor
is
similar
distinct
hazelnut
taste
mellow
toasted
grains
and
light
yeast
character
pretty
clean
and
simple
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
a
little
thin
bodied
and
flaccid
though
thankfully
not
sweet
or
artificial
cant
say
its
something
id
get
again
but
it
was
alright
highly
clear
reddish
brown
small
off
white
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
and
caramel
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
definite
nutty
roasted
up
front
malt
profile
caramel
sweetness
rounds
it
off
on
the
end
the
mouthfeel
however
is
not
so
good
very
thin
and
watery
very
low
carbonation
the
flavor
was
fine
but
the
mouthfeel
kind
of
ruined
what
could
have
been
a
great
beer
overall
a
good
brown
ale
and
a
good
fall
seasonal
beer
o
i
dont
think
ill
ever
really
love
a
hazelnut
beer
this
one
though
is
decent
its
mild
and
simplistic
but
also
easy
to
drink
and
not
annoyingly
artificial
i
think
this
one
is
just
right
being
only
2
beers
in
a
fall
12
pack
o
not
very
impressed
with
this
beer
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
the
best
aspects
of
this
beer
however
the
taste
is
not
at
all
what
i
would
expect
of
a
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
hazelnut
creamed
coffee
you
might
enjoy
this
beer
as
a
dessert
after
your
meal
however
i
do
not
enjoy
coffee
very
much
myself
which
might
be
why
i
gave
this
a
low
rating
o
surprisingly
good
i
thought
this
was
nearly
top
notch
and
an
improvement
from
a
standard
brown
ale
not
artificial
tasting
not
cloying
flavors
of
hazelnuts
and
chocolate
meld
very
nicely
with
the
toasted
malty
nuttiness
of
a
brown
ale
o
overall
i
couldnt
really
taste
much
hazelnut
too
it
thought
i
could
smell
it
it
was
still
a
pretty
good
beer
though
great
for
when
fall
comes
calling
id
recommend
this
smc
overall
a
nice
nutty
ale
its
ok
for
a
fall
seasonal
but
im
not
super
impressed
overall
a
tasty
brew
why
its
like
a
hazelnut
nectar
with
the
nigh
unmistakable
sa
house
yeast
character
offered
as
part
of
the
autumn
twelve
pack
it
features
a
great
smell
with
abundant
roasted
malt
maple
nut
and
toffee
notes
and
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
but
not
quite
as
strong
its
fairly
sweet
but
doesnt
get
too
far
away
from
itself
with
some
bitterness
coming
in
there
to
even
things
out
mouthfeel
is
good
with
medium
thickness
moderate
carbonation
and
just
a
little
stickiness
in
there
its
not
as
intricate
or
tasty
as
it
could
have
been
but
its
a
solid
addition
to
the
mix
pack
the
smell
is
fantastic
and
it
makes
everything
else
worthwhile
atmosphere
is
pretty
strong
dark
hue
foamy
head
and
some
persistent
albeit
light
lacing
nose
is
a
great
combination
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
truly
hypnotic
peaty
and
malty
with
some
unsweetened
dark
chocolate
notes
ultimately
a
little
shallow
but
still
well
done
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
one
complaint
is
the
feel
with
the
rich
creamy
tones
in
scent
and
taste
i
have
an
expectation
of
a
similar
feel
but
instead
get
a
loose
carbonated
tone
very
interesting
experience
from
as
but
taste
rules
out
here
not
a
huge
sa
fan
bought
the
mixed
twelve
pack
on
a
whim
this
was
the
highlight
of
the
pack
the
nuttiness
was
just
right
and
blended
with
the
other
flavors
perfectly
the
octoberfest
was
ok
as
was
the
ipa
but
this
one
was
just
right
would
buy
a
sixer
of
this
for
sure
solid
brew
thinking
as
i
finish
this
has
anyone
tried
eating
it
with
chocolate
bars
or
chocolate
cream
pie
just
an
idea
i
have
not
because
i
thought
of
it
too
late
o
very
smooth
and
tasty
beer
easy
to
drink
and
has
enough
flavor
to
drink
several
at
once
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
broadly
similar
to
rogues
hazelnut
brown
nectar
if
this
were
offered
in
sixpacks
id
probably
pick
it
up
every
once
in
a
while
and
it
would
be
a
solid
value
alternative
to
the
aforementioned
rogue
offering
as
it
stands
its
a
worthy
addition
to
the
fall
seasonal
pack
2nd
up
off
of
the
fall
mixer
from
sam
adams
not
a
big
brown
fan
but
i
enjoyed
this
must
be
the
hazlenuts
of
which
i
ironically
hate
in
any
liquid
form
very
subtle
smell
and
flavor
of
the
hazlenuts
balanced
well
with
the
roasted
malts
tasted
a
lil
chocolate
as
well
though
the
coffee
tastes
as
advertised
eludes
me
hits
all
the
right
notes
and
i
look
forward
to
it
getting
a
little
more
cooler
so
i
can
enjoy
a
few
note
of
these
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
this
beer
is
really
sweet
and
even
though
it
hits
the
spot
right
now
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
with
that
being
said
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
beer
is
beautiful
it
pours
a
clear
deep
mahogany
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
a
thick
retention
ring
remains
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
nuts
and
biscuit
taste
is
very
malt
forward
with
some
toffee
and
caramel
finish
is
slightly
coffee
but
is
overpowered
by
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
unremarkable
pretty
nice
beer
not
great
but
not
bad
either

o
i
like
this
beer
and
it
works
well
in
the
cooling
monthsi
just
wish
the
flavors
were
more
natural
and
came
together
a
bit
better
overall
a
good
brew
would
have
to
be
in
a
mood
to
drink
it
and
probably
wouldnt
get
it
in
a
6
pack
but
good
none
the
less
o
a
little
nutty
for
my
taste
but
not
bad
hazel
brown
pours
out
a
reddishbrown
with
a
large
head
that
quickly
drops
the
aroma
is
very
nice
theres
a
great
roasted
hazelnut
aroma
over
some
malts
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
the
taste
offers
out
a
very
nice
realistic
hazelnut
flavor
without
becoming
overly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
its
a
nice
tasting
hazelnut
beer
but
seems
to
be
missing
something
compared
to
my
favourite
rogues
hazelnut
brown
nectar
still
very
good
though
the
mouth
is
decent
but
i
would
like
a
bit
more
substance
easy
drinking
beer
that
fits
in
nicely
with
my
fall
and
winter
beer
rotation
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
late
berghoff
winter
hazelnut
beer
damn
i
wish
they
still
made
that
one
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
with
sweet
cocoa
notes
trailing
off
slightly
bitter
a
light
to
medium
body
and
light
to
average
carbonation
what
this
lacks
in
mouthfeel
it
makes
up
for
with
its
flavor
overall
i
thought
this
was
very
good
real
nutty
and
easy
to
drink
a
fine
example
of
this
style
that
was
very
smooth
and
hopefully
not
a
onetime
brew
overall
its
a
nice
brown
ale
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
toffee
and
some
hazelnut
character
the
flavor
is
very
similar
there
is
a
good
amount
of
sweet
chocolate
and
toasted
nuts
as
well
as
a
hint
of
toffee
and
caramel
the
beer
is
very
sweet
and
has
no
real
hop
character
to
it
i
also
get
a
light
hint
of
mint
but
that
may
be
my
imagination
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
very
nice
beer
besides
the
added
spices
theres
really
nothing
to
unique
about
this
brew
its
just
imo
exactly
what
a
brown
ale
should
be
like
most
breweries
make
their
brown
ales
too
watered
down
including
sam
smith
for
my
taste
and
i
always
feel
like
if
they
would
just
add
more
malts
it
would
be
the
brown
ale
im
looking
for
sam
adams
did
just
that
creating
a
cream
nutty
malt
bomb
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
almost
drank
more
like
a
porter
or
stout
not
really
my
type
of
beer
did
not
care
for
this
one
at
all
although
i
can
see
how
other
would
enjoy
this
brew
easy
drinking
little
brown
ale
the
hazelnut
is
a
very
nice
addition
o
im
really
digging
the
hazelnut
flavor
and
smell
in
this
brew
the
beer
is
all
around
inviting
to
me
and
pretty
drinkable
with
almost
anything
id
definitely
pick
up
a
6pack
of
this
brew
in
the
future
cheers
o
this
ones
a
success
for
sa
imo
its
flavorful
enough
to
satisfy
while
still
keeping
it
light
enough
to
session
a
solid
beer
good
nutty
flavors
without
going
overboard
hard
to
tell
if
the
flavors
come
from
authentic
ingredients
or
not
but
still
kudos
to
sam
adams
o
the
taste
is
fantastic
a
bit
like
a
marzen
with
frangelico
added
other
qualities
are
lacking
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
similar
to
the
chocolate
ale
and
coffee
ale
i
was
impressed
nutty
malty
and
quite
tasty
brown
ale
lots
of
carramel
on
the
tongue
and
well
into
the
finish
malts
carry
the
weight
nice
rounded
mouthfeel
enjoyable
aba
nutella
in
a
bottle
it
isnt
but
its
still
pretty
good
my
hazelnut
brown
beer
vote
still
goes
rogue
though
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
shock
at
first
being
sweeter
and
simpler
than
the
dry
almost
spice
induced
aroma
might
portend
in
the
end
i
get
used
to
it
as
the
hazelnut
returns
to
offer
a
lingering
finish
after
a
somewhat
simple
start
overall
this
beer
offers
an
odd
mouthfeel
initially
though
this
does
balance
with
some
warming
in
the
glass
a
good
sipper
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
in
the
long
run
nice
aroma
of
hazlenut
and
caramel
pours
a
nice
ruddy
brown
with
large
beige
head
taste
is
crisp
again
notes
of
hazelnut
and
caramel
slight
touch
of
toffee
and
a
hint
of
hops
pleasant
on
the
tounge
overall
others
disagree
with
me
but
im
just
not
crazy
about
it
not
bad
just
not
something
i
would
buy
again
to
treat
myself
to
o
ill
skip
this
entry
in
the
snack
box
in
the
future
o
really
good
brown
offering
from
sam
adams
overall
a
surprisingly
good
hazelnut
brown
bettered
by
the
worldclass
rogue
hazelnut
but
closer
in
overall
quality
than
i
expected
even
from
this
highly
reliable
brewery
improves
with
warming
tastespicy
malt
toasted
hazelnutcaramel
hazelnut
not
overdone
nice
flavor
but
a
bit
thinbodied
flavor
fades
upon
warming
a
bit
taste
is
of
hazelnut
caramel
a
touch
of
sweetness
with
spice
and
hops
in
the
background
not
bad
at
all
moutfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
with
good
drinkability
overall
it
is
pretty
good
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
overall
quite
good
the
nuttiness
might
be
a
bit
over
the
top
but
i
thought
this
was
a
sweet
and
malty
treat
o
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
that
ive
seen
that
is
relatively
light
but
has
robust
flavor
id
like
this
as
a
6er
o
i
am
not
a
huge
ran
of
big
nutty
beers
and
this
is
not
an
exception
the
sweet
vanilla
is
a
big
change
of
taste
that
occurs
to
quickly
good
things
inside
just
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
like
to
see
o
well
sam
delivered
the
hazel
brown
for
sure
straight
forward
from
what
you
would
expect
by
the
label
loads
of
thick
hazelnut
aroma
and
flavor
accompanied
by
caramel
and
toffee
malts
create
a
rich
brew
to
enjoy
with
dessert
not
something
i
would
regularly
drink
and
probably
wont
purchase
again
i
do
have
to
give
it
props
for
delivering
what
it
advertises
if
you
like
hazelnut
you
will
love
this
cheers

hazel
brown
is
a
very
clear
deep
reddish
brown
ale
topped
with
a
dense
off
white
foam
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
caramel
toffee
and
hazelnut
are
in
the
first
sniff
there
is
some
roastiness
and
maybe
some
grass
soft
dry
and
medium
bodied
it
leaves
the
tongue
a
little
chalky
this
is
bursting
with
hazelnut
its
not
huge
or
overpowering
the
flavors
all
melt
very
well
theres
just
enough
bitterness
to
avoid
seeming
sweet
at
all
this
is
so
smooth
and
easy
it
could
be
a
session
ale
any
time
overall
my
clear
favorite
out
of
this
years
fall
mixer
very
solid
beer
probably
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
well
worth
a
try
served
from
bottle
into
a
shaker
poured
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
nutty
milk
chocolate
and
slight
roasted
malt
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
milk
chocolate
nutty
and
earth
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
got
this
one
in
a
variety
pack
for
fall
and
was
kind
of
interested
in
trying
it
based
on
some
of
the
reviews
i
saw
on
here
however
this
one
really
didnt
fit
in
with
my
palate
overly
great
it
was
decent
so
dont
get
me
wrong
there
however
there
really
wasnt
a
huge
amount
of
stuff
going
on
in
this
one
to
keep
me
interested
i
did
like
the
notes
of
milk
chocolate
but
that
was
about
it
worth
trying
for
the
curious
overall
a
pretty
nice
version
of
a
brown
ale
the
hazelnuts
add
a
nice
kick
and
the
sweetness
is
kept
well
in
balance
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
dense
ivory
cap
that
settles
to
a
1inch
cap
nice
aromas
of
toasted
hazelnuts
caramel
and
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
quite
similar
to
the
nose
nice
englishstyle
brown
ale
base
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
toffee
and
malt
with
more
rich
hazelnut
very
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
fairly
crisp
with
a
medium
body
and
ample
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
addition
to
the
fall
lineup
but
i
do
sorta
miss
last
years
rauchbier
this
is
a
decent
attempt
at
a
hazelnut
brown
ale
but
i
think
its
a
bit
too
strong
on
that
nutty
flavor
its
a
big
mouthful
of
hazelnut
thats
out
of
balance
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
i
found
it
hard
to
finish
as
much
i
wanted
to
enjoy
it
the
aroma
is
nice
like
a
cup
of
hazelnut
coffee
a
decent
try
no
harm
in
trying
it
in
the
seasonal
pack
but
ill
keep
turning
to
rogue
for
my
hazelnut
fix
overall
great
beer
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
get
a
lot
for
your
money
it
isnt
strong
or
an
imperial
that
ok
what
matters
is
is
that
it
is
quality
rare
you
a
product
this
good
and
this
easy
to
find
especially
for
the
price
salud
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
smell
is
mostly
hazelnut
and
maybe
a
little
chocolate
taste
is
initially
very
sweet
with
some
strong
hazelnut
flavor
after
that
next
is
some
toffee
and
then
some
light
espresso
the
finish
is
slightly
nutty
and
earthy
mouthfeel
is
average
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
i
hope
they
keep
it
and
have
it
again
next
year
pours
a
clear
dark

54
inch

color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
strong
sweet
malt
nuts
hint
of
roasted
malt
hint
of
hop
and
slight
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
brown

mouth
feel

smooth

clean

strong
sweet
malt
slight
wheat
hint
of
hops
nuts
and
a
hint
of
pale
malt
overall
good
appearance
feel
and
aroma
the
biggest
flaw
is
that
the
wheat
metallic
flavor
is
slightly
offputting
overall
very
easy
drinking
and
quite
tasty
a
pleasant
drinking
brown
ale
standard
brown
ale
with
a
medium
body
and
a
touch
too
much
carbonation
the
hazelnuts
add
complexity
and
a
touch
of
smoothness
there
are
some
late
breaking
hops
to
reckon
with
as
well
more
complex
than
most
browns
for
a
nice
change
of
pace
worth
a
try
this
offering
is
a
bit
thin
but
there
certainly
has
a
tasty
side
to
it
in
spite
of
the
thinness
bought
as
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
brown
ales
can
be
found
all
over
but
the
hazelnut
in
this
one
gives
it
a
nice
touch
smells
a
bit
nutty
with
a
roasted
aroma
taste
is
medium
bodied
some
nice
roastiness
and
the
hazelnuts
really
come
through
along
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
toffee
nice
balance
and
finish
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
a
usually
boring
style
o
not
quite
in
hazelnut
nectars
neighborhood
but
really
pretty
tasty
stuff
i
could
see
myself
buying
a
sixer
of
this
glad
to
recommend
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
sporting
a
solid
filmy
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
with
butter
toffee
and
milk
chocolate
lots
of
caramel
as
well
taste
is
spicy
and
slightly
bitter
earthy
hops
and
more
butter
and
toffee
some
chocolate
in
the
background
it
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
dry
finish
this
is
a
nice
beer
from
samuel
adams
id
drink
it
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
seems
so
fake
its
hard
to
get
past
it
ive
found
that
many
nutbased
browns
end
up
tasting
like
a
paper
bag
after
a
pretty
short
time
so
making
this
seasonalonly
bypasses
that
problem
o
even
though
it
didnt
have
as
much
hazelnut
as
i
was
expecting
after
the
aroma
this
is
still
a
really
good
brown
ale
it
smells
fantastic
and
is
very
tasty
and
drinkable
im
glad
sam
adams
added
this
one
to
the
fall
lineup
ogreat
tasting
beer
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
sam
adams
look
forward
to
having
this
beer
again
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
good
sized
and
very
persistent
head
smell
is
mostly
grassy
hops
maybe
a
touch
of
hazel
nuts
if
you
know
to
look
for
them
pleasant
caramel
and
toffee
brown
ale
taste
hazel
nuts
are
again
very
much
in
the
background
but
do
add
a
pleasant
touch
of
complexity
and
a
little
roundness
to
the
taste
that
is
noticeable
in
the
late
middle
to
finish
pretty
well
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
pretty
drinkable
and
overall
a
good
brown
ale
with
a
minor
twist

comkajiisbeerreviews
o
hazelnut
is
a
good
addition
to
a
brown
ale
but
it
would
seem
that
to
really
get
the
hazelnut
flavor
more
would
have
to
be
used
overall
not
a
bad
brew
though
i
wouldnt
six
it
single
finger
head
on
deep
amber
body
nuts
caramel
chocolate
malts
and
breads
flavors
of
chocolate
hazelnut
chestnut
caramel
and
bready
malts
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
really
drinkable
but
a
little
too
sweet
better
than
i
was
expecting
from
sam
adams
for
one
of
their
side
bar
beers
o
another
sam
adams
easy
drinker
a
great
fall
beer
to
sit
out
on
the
porch
and
relax
with
on
a
cool
day
rjt
this
beer
has
a
nice
reddish
brown
body
with
a
small
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
nice
aroma
of
nuttiness
and
as
it
warms
up
the
chocolate
aroma
comes
through
the
taste
has
a
nice
nutty
sweetness
to
it
with
some
malt
goodness
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
mouth
feel
is
good
and
overall
a
good
brown
ale
had
this
again
was
cloyingly
sweet
very
artificial
tasting
did
not
enjoy
a
descent
brown
ale
an
actual
brown
colored
beer
would
help
though
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
but
def
has
the
capacity
to
become
too
sweet
i
believe
especially
after
it
gets
closer
to
room
temperature
or
if
you
have
too
many
o
a
solid
nutty
brown
ale
that
is
very
approachable
o
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
standard
nutty
brown
ale
which
i
love
with
just
a
hint
of
sweet
hazelnut
character
what
i
got
was
an
overpowering
syrupy
brew
which
masked
any
other
positive
flavor
profiles
that
may
be
lurking
underneath
o
drinkable
i
guess
but
not
enjoyable
i
actually
dumped
mine
about
23
of
the
way
through
it
the
only
beer
i
can
compare
this
to
is
frangelic
mountain
brown
and
really
theres
just
no
comparison
if
you
like
diacetyl
this
is
your
beer
i
wish
this
beer
was
a
little
less
sweet
and
more
balanced
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
o
very
enjoyable
possibly
my
favorite
in
the
variety
pack
if
it
were
sold
on
its
own
i
think
id
buy
it
o
overall
an
unwelcome
addition
to
the
variety
pack
i
got
to
hand
it
to
sam
adams
for
always
trying
new
ideas
but
it
also
seems
like
their
variety
packs
are
always
saddled
down
with
a
horrible
style
or
two
i
have
to
admit
i
dont
like
hazelnut
at
all
and
on
second
tasting
i
dont
think
it
is
too
terrible
considering
the
strength
of
that
flavor
but
wished
they
could
have
included
something
else
a
little
different
the
smoked
beer
etc
o
a
delicious
american
brown
ale
id
definitely
have
another
m
medium
bodied
semisweet
finish
nuttiness
lingers
on
and
carbonation
is
good
o
a
surprisingly
good
beer
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
quite
enjoyed
it
the
hazelnut
is
subtle
which
is
nice
i
just
wish
it
were
a
bit
creamier
and
with
the
same
depth
of
flavor
as
aroma
it
pours
a
gentle
dark
brown
and
leaves
the
same
color
body
a
half
inch
white
foamy
head
appears
and
lasts
for
a
good
minute
some
foamy
rings
are
left
in
the
lace
the
smell
has
nuts
malts
and
light
toffee
the
taste
has
the
previously
mentioned
flavors
with
some
light
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
about
a
medium
with
nothing
harsh
on
the
tongue
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
wont
have
a
problem
drinking
the
rest
its
a
taste
beer
overall
impressive
brew
from
sam
good
balance
and
flavor
and
smell
would
love
to
have
this
on
tap
o
again
pleasantly
surprised
one
of
the
better
browns
ive
had
some
people
say
the
brewer
patriot
has
gotten
cocky
with
their
seasonals
and
if
thats
true
this
may
have
brought
them
back
from
there
and
if
you
love
hazelnut
dive
right
in
this
is
a
good
beer
that
could
be
a
very
good
beer
if
every
sip
tasted
like
the
first
one
this
would
be
a
standout
sam
adams
beer
instead
its
just
a
slightly
above
average
offering
a
great
addition
to
the
harvest
collection
highly
drinkable
i
sometimes
get
annoyed
with
bbcs
constant
production
of
seasonal
seemingly
halfassed
beer
releases
but
this
is
pretty
good
not
great
but
i
would
drink
this
again
if
jonesing
for
some
hazelnut
odi
love
all
things
hazelnut
still
waiting
for
a
beer
that
i
can
describe
as
nutella
beer
this
was
kinda
close
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
sam
smiths
nut
brown
ale
which
i
had
very
recently
this
was
also
kinda
like
a
milder
version
of
founders
frangelic
mountain
brown
anyway
i
liked
this
one
of
sam
adams
better
recent
variety
brews
overall
a
great
addition
to
the
sam
adams
lineup
a
faithful
interpretation
of
the
brown
ale
with
a
great
hazelnut
flavor
a
perfect
fall
seasonal
heres
hoping
that
they
keep
this
one
around
overall
impression
a
drinkable
novelty
i
wouldnt
want
it
all
the
time
but
perfect
for
the
time
of
year
and
it
lives
up
to
the
label
worth
a
try
o
not
a
bad
beer
i
really
wouldnt
recommend
it
or
recommend
against
it
newer
beer
drinkers
may
have
a
better
appreciation
for
this
pretty
decent
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
from
the
seasonal
packs
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
nice
mix

flavors
really
nice

glad
i
got
to
try
this
and
im
excited
theres
still
one
more

would
definitely
buy
more

really
enjoying
this
as
i
hope
for
cooler

dryer

medium
bodied
bubbly
a
little
more
heft
would
do
some
good
all
in
all
impressed
with
the
taste
of
this
beer
when
i
had
the
first
beer
that
was
in
the
mix
pack
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
and
the
hazelnut
extract
came
off
a
little
cheap
but
now
with
this
second
beer
im
appreciating
the
beer
more
the
sweetness
of
the
hazelnut
and
rich
roasted
malts
blend
in
really
well
together
and
the
noble
hops
really
come
through
at
the
end
with
the
spicy
bitterness
ill
definitely
be
glad
to
have
it
again
in
another
mix
pack
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
wont
have
a
problem
drinking
the
rest
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
pours
clear
toffee
brown
with
a
threefinger
length
eggshell
colored
head
the
head
retreats
at
a
moderate
pace
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
and
a
cap
of
head
is
left
atop
the
beer
i
can
pick
up
aromas
of
caramel
malt
and
hazelnut
it
is
not
a
strong
aroma
the
flavors
of
hazelnut
and
caramel
malt
hit
the
mouth
right
at
the
start
its
mildly
sweet
and
very
nutty
the
nutty
character
from
the
hazelnut
remains
in
the
aftertaste
i
also
pick
up
some
hops
on
the
back
end
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
drinkability
this
is
an
ok
beer
with
hitormiss
qualities
for
some
reason
is
it
relatively
flat
in
the
glass
i
spilled
a
little
from
my
glass
and
i
wont
consider
it
alcohol
abuse
i
would
prefer
to
steer
clear
of
this
in
the
future
a
pretty
average
beer
for
the
style
there
is
nothing
here
that
leaves
a
lasting
impression
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
overall
average
not
a
favorite
overall
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
it
has
an
interesting
taste
that
makes
it
worth
picking
up
to
try
at
least
once
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
just
could
use
some
more
character
fits
well
in
the
mix
pack
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
o
very
solid
brown
ale
overall
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
sam
adams
that
i
have
had
o
very
very
tasty
probably
my
favorite
out
of
the
mix
pack
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brown
ale
with
just
a
hint
of
hazelnut
this
is
pretty
good
and
enjoyable
though
its
not
groundbreaking
i
cant
think
of
another
brown
ale
that
is
really
leaps
and
bounds
ahead
of
it
certainly
worth
having
o
good
fall
beer
o
ive
always
had
a
problem
with
sa
but
im
starting
to
respect
them
more
in
recent
times
this
is
definitely
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
by
them
followed
by
norse
legend
which
is
also
very
solid
and
i
would
love
to
see
six
packs
or
bombers
of
this
but
thats
probably
not
going
to
happen
the
one
gripe
i
have
with
sa
is
that
i
hate
buying
their
variety
packs
just
to
get
two
beers
of
a
style
i
want
to
try
fucking
take
out
the
boston
lager
and
the
other
year
round
and
keep
it
to
the
seasonal
varieties
so
what
goes
with
hazel
brown
i
recommend
a
dose
of
bachs
music
taste
is
big
on
the
roasted
malt
front
the
hazelnut
is
still
well
represented
yet
not
as
big
as
it
was
on
the
nose
toffee
bit
of
a
burnt
malt
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
body
is
thin
but
a
fairly
assertive
carbonation
distracts
from
it
final
thoughts
finally
a
samuel
adams
beer
i
want
to
buy
more
of
even
through
its
faults
this
brown
ale
rings
true
to
its
name
and
gives
you
huge
hazelnut
flavor
itd
probably
even
be
sessionable
under
the
right
conditions
i
went
into
drinking
this
with
medium
expectations
but
it
flew
right
past
those
upon
the
first
sip
if
they
started
with
a
slightly
higher
o
g
then
this
might
be
a
favorite
forget
everything
you
thought
you
knew
about
nut
brown
ales
wow
its
nice
to
be
back
in
the
united
states
from
a
beer
standpoint
after
a
couple
months
of
drinking
pale
lagers
and
boring
yellow
water
finallz
ive
got
a
nice
creative
dark
brew
here
this
baby
pours
maple
syrup
color
equal
parts
brown
and
auburn
red
in
the
light
a
one
inch
white
head
rests
on
top
the
smell
is
fantastic
nutty
and
sweet
notes
of
vanilla
and
almond
and
hazelnut
are
all
there
flavor
features
the
hazelnut
in
a
really
nice
way
there
are
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
notes
but
they
are
complementary
not
overbearing
the
vanilla
is
also
there
in
the
finish
which
has
a
lovely
roast
malt
flavor
feel
is
decent
could
stand
a
little
more
body
i
think
but
the
carbonation
is
good
this
might
be
a
little
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
its
a
very
flavorful
brew
that
is
perfect
for
the
chilly
nights
that
are
on
the
way
o
i
found
this
to
be
lacking
in
depth
and
overly
simple
with
the
hazelnut
flavor
seeming
very
artificial
and
addedin
versus
something
that
was
a
product
of
the
brewing
process
not
quite
as
deep
or
sweet
as
it
needs
to
be
and
the
hazelnut
winds
up
being
a
little
astringent
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
weakest

sa
autumn
craft
pack
by
far
this
beer
pours
as
you
would
expect
dark
hazy
brown
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
and
red
around
the
edges
this
beer
is
very
earthy
there
is
a
lot
of
nutty
flavors
and
a
slight
spicyness
from
the
hops
there
is
also
a
nice
bit
of
chocolate
and
cocoa
some
coffee
and
toffee

a

this
beer
is
appropriately
sized

still
pleasant
a
good
brown
hazel
brown
is
sold
this
year
as
part
of
the
harvest
sampler
pack
it
is
a
good
tasting
brown
ale
that
will
appeal
most
to
those
who
like
the
taste
of
hazelnuts
but
there
is
much
about
this
beer
to
enjoy
by
everyone
the
nutty
flavor
pleasant
finish
and
good
balance
make
it
a
good
craft
beer
for
most
any
occasion
this
brew
is
dark
brown
but
allows
a
reddish
light
through
the
head
is
a
dark
tan

it
quickly
fades
the
aroma
is

chocolate

toasted

bread
and
a

lots
of
roasted

aromas
not
much
of

too
almostwatery
overall
eh
one
of
the
more
disappointing
craft
browns
ive
had
whats
with
the
sourness
best
by
date
was
still
well
within
range
so
its
somewhat
baffling
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
starting
to
build
a
lot
of
respect
for
brooklyn
brewery
kind
of
a
dark
maroon
color
with
a
big
frothy
off
white
head
has
a
dark
malty
smell
with
trace
amount
of
hops
taste
has
hints
of
chocolate
and
roastiness
with
a
tad
bit
of
sweetness
overall
pretty
good
beer
feel
pretty
smooth
with
a
medium
body
o
this
needs
a
bit
of
sweetness
or
a
bit
of
hop
complexity
to
step
it
up
a
notch
perfectly
drinkable
if
simple
now
but
it
seems
like
its
a
good
base
upon
which
so
much
could
be
added
oi
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
great
with
food
as
well
as
without
very
versatile
one
of
my
more
favorite
browns
upslope
is
good
too
im
a
bit
confused
by
the
bros
rating
here
i
think
this
is
a
solidly
good
beer
mid

brooklyn
puts
their
nuts
in
your
mouth
this
is
an
all
around
good
beer
i
visited
the
brewery
and
was
amazed
by
the
dedication
to
the
specific
styles
of
beer
the
have
embraced
the
beer
itself
is
worth
the
effort
excellent
classic
brown
ale
taste
was
an
ok
beer
not
much
of
a
brown
ale
fan
love
it
classic
brooklyn
one
of
the
staples
overall
for
me
this
is
a
welcome
antidote
to
the
almost
relentless
hoppiness
of
most
current
american
beers
the
hopheads
will
no
doubt
hate
it
but
for
those
who
prefer
things
a
bit
maltier
ie
people
like
me
this
isnt
bad
at
all
not
sure
id
want
to
have
a
session
on
it
at
nearly
6
abv
but
its
not
something
id
actively
turn
down
either
not
bad
but
dont
stand
in
line
for
a
slug
great
brown
ale
with
lots
of
toasted
flavors
almost
like
a
porter
but
as
smooth
as
other
browns
overall
pretty
average
brown
ale
on
a
cold
evening
id
rather
have
their
winter
ale
o
a
perfectly
fine
american
brown
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
bolder
in
aroma
and
flavor
but
quite
sessionable
and
easy
to
drink
decent
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
3
43
like
the
beer
a
lot
dark
brown
color
when
poured
very
smooth
and
clean
while
drinking
it
not
heavy
by
any
means
clear
light
brown
color
medium
offwhite
head
aroma
of
malt
caramel
and
grain
bready
and
caramel
taste
with
pleasant
hoppy
and
dry
finish
overall
this
is
more
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
brown
ale
in
fact
this
is
nearly
a
porter
very
much
like
turbodog
but
less
sweet
and
having
that
brooklyn
ale
yeast
they
seem
to
have
a
house
style
interesting
that
this
has
a
little
wheat
in
the
grain
bill
o
solid
beer
not
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
but
still
good
poured
this
into
a
glass
it
has
a
mahogany
color
body
with
thin
head
the
aroma
has
roasty
malt
and
a
little
hop
coming
from
it
the
taste
has
a
roasty
chocolaty
up
front
and
a
little
hop
towards
the
back
the
malt
is
more
dominant
than
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
overall
a
good
beer
this
is
a
sessionable
if
not
quite
remarkable
offering
chez
woodys
kitchen
is
much
like
the
alley
at
the
beginning
of
each
episode
of
king
of
the
hill
nothing
happens
until
the
can
is
cracked
the
bottle
cap
is
popped
the
keg
is
tapped
and
pouring
etc
the
bottle
is
like
my
old
lady
at
this
point
sweating
in
anticipation
of
my
touch
and
ready
to
pop
boom
the
rush
of
liquid
into
my
glass
was
fascinating
creating
a
big
rolling
pseudocascade
as
i
watched
like
most
males
i
am
a
very
visual
learner
and
i
was
transfixed
by
the
creation
of
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
lighttan
head
with
great
retention
i
held
it
up
to
the
naural
light
of
the
day
to
behold
and
i
was
not
disappointed
i
fully
agree
with
mahogany
semidry
and
eminently
drinkable
i
do
not
often
drink

more

54if
you
like
malt
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
the
color
is
a
rich
brown
with
a
deep
tan
head
it
doesnt
have
much
of
a
nose
but
it
has
a
nice
mix
of
malty
sweetness
and
soft
hop
flavor
it
is
a
friendly
and
unassertive
beer
that
you
can
drink

a

the
taste
is
brown

that
doesnt
allow
the
sweet
to

away

mouth
the
beer
is
a
bit
flabby
with
sweet
hoppy
sticky
malt
flavors
as
well
as
roasted
undertones
never
quite
getting
cleaned
up
flavors
are
generous
with
fruity
notes
followed
by
caramel
toasty
malt
and
tangy
hop
a
rather
complex
brown
that
with
a
bit
more
zip
would
be
quite
tasty
brooklyn
brown
was
served
from
a
12oz
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
rich
mahogany
color
and
was
adorned
by
an
ample
tan
head
that
left
nice
lacing
the
nose
was
mildy
sharp
with
raisinycocoa
coffeeish
maltiness
on
the
palate
a
sharp
lightly
roasty
tasty
coffee
malt
profile
released
a
zingy
toffeelike
edge
in
the
transtition
to
a
nicely
astringent
roastybittered
finish
that
left
lingering
sweet
coffee
flavors
the
body
was
a
bit
light
though
smooth
and
the
vigorous
carbonation
lent
a
good
energy
to
the
middle
flavors
brooklyn
brown
is
a
tasty
brew
that
i
would
enjoy
again
i
havent
tried
very
many
brown
ales
beyond
newcastle
and
dogfish
head
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
taste
and
could
be
a
little
more
balanced
but
an
awesome
one
to
bring
out
on
friends
who
dont
like
dark
beers
another
strong
offering
from
the
brooklyn
brewery
bender
factor
this
poor
example
was
on
sale
recently
for
2
50
pint
at
my
local
watering
hole
i
wonder
why
never
again
nice
amberrootbery
medium
dark
and
clear
not
much
head
tiny
bit
of
white
rint
around
the
edge
with
a
dusting
in
the
center
mainly
malty
scents
lightly
dark
tastes
of
roasted
malts
darkened
toast
bit
of
merlot
medhighly
carbinated
almost
sodalike
just
a
step
below
maybe
or
as
if
you
let
your
soda
sit
for
a
bit
carb
is
just
a
tad
high
feeling
on
this
for
me
easy
drinker
though
not
too
heavy
at
all
and
the
flavors
are
very
nice
and
not
too
intense
just
very
good
and
highly
drinkable
i
dont
care
for
brown
ales
as
a
general
rule
but
this
was
definitely
worth
the
purchase
it
may
be
good
as
a
transition
beer
for
beginners
nice
brown
color
with
a
slightly
foamy
head
smell
was
pleasant
a
slight
roasty
overtone
taste
was
smooth
maybe
even
a
little
nutty
well
balanced
and
quite
pleasant
this
would
be
a
great
brew
for
a
kegbased
function
or
as
a
session
choice
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
out
there
pours
a
copper
to
brown
color
with
a
beige
head
some
caramelly
malt
aromas
nutty
and
inviting
hops
are
reasonably
fair
in
this
beer
working
to
balance
out
the
sweet
and
roasty
malt
aromas
nutty
and
smooth
with
some
residual
sugars
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
dead
wet
leaves
and
other
earthy
notes
come
to
mind
reasonably
thin
tasting
and
pleasantly
drinkable
probably
on
of
the
better
brown
ales
from
the
u
s
this
poured
an
attractive
dark
and
burgundy
brown
color
clear
with
glowing
cherrymahogany
highlights
shining
through
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
creamy
tan
head
topped
the
beer
off
the
aroma
is
rich
and
dark
with
caramel
chocolate
and
roasted
grains
there¬ís
a
slight
alcohol
spiciness
and
a
sweet
roasted
oats
bran
note
warming
and
inviting
the
taste
is
sharp
and
rich
with
bittersweet
chocolates
and
full
of
roasted
notes
light
to
medium
in
body
the
finish
is
clean
complex
and
satisfying
this
still
remains
the
quintessential
american
brown
ale
final
thought
not
too
shabby
a
heavier
tasting
brown
ale
that
works
overall
a
very
decent
brown
ale
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
brooklyn
brewery
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
yet
very
accessible
as
well
recommended
this
is
my
least
favorite
style
but
truly
this
is
acrid
horrible
stuff
this
qualifies
as
downthesink
material
stay
away
this
brew
looks
rich
poured
a
deep
mahogany
a
bit
darker
than
the
other
browns
ive
tried
finger
thick
cream
colored
head
that
lasted
a
few
minutes
rich
nuttyraisin
scent
dark
fruit
reminsent
of
a
few
doppelbocks
ive
had
which
got
me
to
thinking
if
the
two
werent
that
different
stylistically
of
course
this
an
ale
and
the
other
is
a
lager
mouthfeel
was
sufficiently
carbonated
slightly
syrupy
seemed
to
fit
the
style
taste
was
quite
complex
way
more
flavorful
than
i
expected
initial
raisin
note
turns
crisp
as
alcohol
warms
then
ends
with
a
bitter
hop
presence
very
drinkable
this
one
ended
up
being
a
real
treat
this
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
brownmahogany
with
a
small
tan
head
the
smell
is
not
that
strong
but
i
can
pick
up
a
toasted
nuts
coffee
scent
if
i
try
real
hard
the
taste
is
great
hints
of
coffee
and
dark
cocoa
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
the
drinkability
is
outstanding
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink

flavor
but
the
thinness
doesnt
detract
from
the
enjoyability
of
this
great
brown
ale
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
good
but
not
great
almost
thin
palate
with
sweetness
on
the
finish
on
the
palate
it
is
very
dry
i
gather
this
is
the
result
of
some
virulent
hyperactive
yeast
strain
that
wants
to
leave
not
a
trace
of
sugar
in
the
broth
this
is
vanguard
indoor
beer
for
intellectuals
lingual
pressure
and
warmth
elicit
a
sliver
of
citrus
peel
sweetness
but
it
never
comes
close
to
rewarding
the
punishment
of
the
powdered
bonelike
dry
hop
tannins
overall
a
nice
drinakable
brown
ale
it
reminded
me
of
a
cross
between
a
new
belgium
abbey
and
a
porter
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
that
went
well
with
my
dinner
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
will
buy
this
one
again
good
brown
ale
i
could
pound
a
few
this
is
one
i
can
drink
all
night
and
have
starts
a
bit
thin
despite
the
obvious
malt
flavors
and
the
mild
roasted
presence
builds
character
as
its
story
develops
across
the
palate
almost
american
pale
ale
like
in
its
acidic
piney
hop
finish
roasted
bitterness
and
toffee
notes
compliment
this
is
originality
to
be
sure
obviously
this
beers
been
around
for
a
while
but
i
cant
see
how
this
wasnt
a
trendsetter
when
it
was
first
released
its
not
going
to
knock
any
big
belgians
off
the
top
of
my
alltime
faves
list
but
this
is
immensely
quaffable
and
surprisingly
interesting
hazel
color
with
reddish
hues
and
a
decent
foamy
head
smells
of
earthy
tones
and
a
overall
nutty
character
very
smooth
tastes
of
roasted
malts
backed
up
with
a
bite
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
to
round
out
this
beer
and
it
finishes
with
a
mellow
nut
fell
and
again
earthy
malts
this
goes
down
fairly
easy
and
is
a
pretty
well
done
brown
ale
but
maybe
at
bit
dry
in
the
aftertaste
beef
notes
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
i
was
into
when
i
started
drinking
better
brews
i
still
like
it
and
have
a
bit
of
a
soft
spot
for
it
but
its
not
like
i
remember
it
poured
a
beautiful
cream
colored
head
that
fine
and
froathy
and
left
a
coat
can¬ít
call
it
lace
without
holes
can
ya
deep
dark
brown
in
color
almost
black
towards
the
top
of
the
pint
glass
with
a
slight
cola
glow
rich
coco
aromas
with
a
caramel
malt
backdrop
coco
flavors
up
front
followed
closely
by
a
mild
coffee
bitterness
and
finishing
a
with
a
bit
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
mild
nothing
at
first
and
then
towards
the
end
its
kind
of
cloying
coating
your
tongue
with
flavor
as
the
beer
disappears
doesn¬ít
seem
to
be
as
hoppy
as
the
bottles
but
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
pours
out
to
a
dark
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
sized
light
brown
head
aroma
is
that
of
malt
it
smells
fresh
the
taste
is
excellent
with
malt
exploding
in
the
mouth
not
as
hoppy
as
some
other
brown
ales
bells
best
brown
comes
to
mind
but
the
malt
sweetness
really
shines
through
this
is
a
very
easytodrink
beer
and
a
definite
credit
to
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
is
rich
in
roasted
and
crystal
malts
it
has
an
intense
chocolate
smell
as
well
the
taste
is
good
it
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
great
brown
flavor
created
through
the
use
of
multiple
crystal
malts
it
also
has
a
decent
hop
taste
that
peeks
through
the
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
awesome
brown
ale
with
real
malt
character
a
great
sessions
ale
a
very
nice
refreshing
brown
ale
that
is
a
great
example
of
the
american
style
oelergud
drinkability
a
good
beer
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
but
definitely
worthy
of
attention
bitter
but
not
too
earthy
and
very
drinkable
medium
feel
smooth
and
pleasant
a
good
not
toosimple
not
toocomplicated
session
beer
the
taste
is
average
which
for
another
brewery
is
ok
but
not
brooklyn
they
have
set
the
bar
quite
high
with
other
offerings
and
this
doesnt
measure
up
it
has
a
nice
little
blend
of
toasted
and
caramel
malt
but
then
it
just
does
nothing
no
character
to
me
outside
of
that
first
wave
of
malt
im
bummed
at
least
they
have
about
six
other
beers
i
love
the
bottle
pours
a
lovely
color
brown
like
a
chocolate
labrador
retriever
into
the
pint
glass
nice
foamy
head
that
stays
the
whole
pint
the
nose
is
adequate
but
the
tatse
of
nuts
like
a
mary
jane
candy
linger
well
after
the
first
mouthful
and
makes
me
want
to
guzzle
another
i
choose
to
drink
slowly
and
the
aroma
and
flavors
improve
as
the
beer
warms
when
the
glass
is
empty
i
am
looking
forward
to
hitting
the
fridge
for
the
next
bottle
i
could
easily
poich
off
the
whole
six
but
work
tomorrow
prevents
it
well
ill
wait
until
tomorrow
to
finish
them
off
an
excellent
brown
ale
probably
my
favorite
american
interpretation
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
into
my
16
oz
brooklyn
brewery
pint
glass
decent
sized
head
settles
down
leaving
a
small
layer
of
foam
on
top
which
leaves
some
nice
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
and
aroma
of
chocolate
and
slight
coffee
solid
roasty
malt
background
balanced
nicely
with
a
good
hop
finish
this
mediumbodied
beer
is
very
drinkable
this
was
brooklyns
first
holiday
beer
back
in
the
late
80s
and
was
soon
added
as
the
second
beer
in
their
lineup
thanks
to
36lblovechild
for
this
one
this
beer
poured
a
mahogany
brown
color
that
when
held
to
the
light
it
showed
hues
of
ruby
it
was
crystal
clear
and
well
carbonated
the
head
that
was
produced
was
a
mix
of
light
tan
and
beige
colors
fairly
thick
dense
and
fluffy
at
first
pour
then
fell
to
just
a
ring
on
the
edges
that
seemed
to
be
fairly
thick
as
well
the
lace
that
was
produced
was
a
sheety
consistency
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
started
off
with
a
plumberry
fruit
like
aroma
mixed
in
with
a
sweet
malt
then
it
dried
out
and
scents
of
ash
cocoa
powder
and
some
roasted
coffee
became
noticeable
it
finished
with
a
hint
of
grain
on
the
end
the
flavors
that
i
tasted
began
with
roasted
malt
with
tads
of
sweetness
in
the
middle
it
waived
with
some
dry
ash
and
sweet
fruit
close
to
the
finish
cocoa
powder
light
hops
and
coffee
and
it
finished
with
a
barky
leafy
grain
taste
hard
to
explain
as
it
warmed
the
finish
became
a
mix
of
the
3
the
after
taste
was
of
roasted
malt
and
light
hops
the
body
was
on
the
medium
side
this
is
a
clean
crisp
complex
and
at
times
dry
beer
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
became
more
pronounced
and
complex
they
melded
together
well
and
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
on
draught
at
winking
lizard
w
a
logo
glass
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
thin
and
slow
lacing
the
aroma
is
roasty
and
malty
medium
body
with
a
nice
smooth
malt
and
caramel
flavor
there
is
a
mildy
nutty
aftertaste
with
a
bit
of
hops
thrown
in
all
in
all
this
is
a
smooth
and
drinkable
brown
poured
with
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
good
thick
light
tannish
head
chocolate
malty
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
very
well
balanced
with
a
thick
chewy
mouthfeel
has
a
little
biscuity
taste
too
it
the
body
isnt
overly
thick
or
heavy
though
just
the
right
balance
to
keep
this
a
very
refreshing
brown
the
hops
are
very
well
balanced
with
the
malt
gotta
say
that
this
might
be
the
best
brown
ale
ive
tasted
so
far
medium
brown
color
foamy
biege
head
nice
looking
beer
in
the
glass
toasted
carmel
malt
smell
taste
is
much
the
same
very
good
toasted
malt
up
from
then
toffee
kinda
like
hard
candy
attention
grabbing
hop
bite
for
the
middle
drinks
then
fades
wierd
but
good
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
beer
a
solid
tasty
brew
one
i
look
forward
to
having
again
soon
but
for
now
im
out
again
this
is
a
beer
that
i
like
to
keep
in
the
fridge
for
any
ol¬í
time
it
has
a
good
head
about
three
quarters
of
an
inch
with
decent
staying
power
a
thick
somewhat
sticky
lace
eventually
forms
on
the
surface
and
also
lingers
for
quite
a
while
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
brown
and
has
a
medium
body
with
not
too
much
carbonation
the
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
and
chocolate
hops
are
in
the
aroma
also
but
are
much
more
restrained
there
is
a
smooth
malty
start
in
which
the
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
from
the
aroma
are
quickly
noticeable
on
the
pallet
some
roastiness
is
also
noticeable
towards
the
end
again
hops
are
fairly
subdued
but
noticeable
in
the
finish
yet
the
malt
base
is
still
strong
with
a
smooth
end
the
lingering
aftertaste
is
of
both
hops
and
roasted
malt
notes
at
times
the
end
seems
smoother
while
at
others
it
seems
have
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
bite
a
very
well
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
flavor
this
brown
ale
is
quite
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
most
however
its
nicely
balanced
and
tasty
an
above
average
brown
ale
that
carries
the
trademark
look
and
feel
of
the
brown
ale
style
lovely
brown
body
with
a
creamy
but
small
head
the
aroma
is
light
but
thoroughly
malty
and
the
flavor
is
mild
and
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
the
feel
tends
to
be
a
bit
thin
and
watery
overall
this
is
a
solid
if
not
great
beer
very
nice
chocolate
appearance
with
nice
bubbly
head
smell
was
balance
between
malt
and
hop
aromas
taste
had
hints
of
coffee
with
a
light
watery
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
odd
starting
medium
and
ending
somewhat
light
and
watery
not
bad
on
a
drinkability
scale
a
hint
of
a
stout
here
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
slight
head
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
chocolatey
taste
is
of
caramel
and
molassass
up
from
with
a
hoppy
finish
definately
an
american
brown
ale
the
mouthfeel
i
feel
is
a
little
overcarbonated
for
the
style
there
is
also
some
warming
alcohol
in
the
mouthfeel
which
i
feel
makes
it
seem
a
bit
strong
for
the
style
although

2
is
hardly
strong
it
seems
so
for
this
particular
beer
notes
a
good
alternative
to
the
newcastles
of
the
world
and
would
make
a
beautiful
bridge
beer
for
that
potential
ba
we
all
know
its
a
brown
ale
for
crying
out
loud
theres
nothing
too
impressive
or
oppressive
abouth
this
beer
its
light
brown
color
and
medium
body
is
full
of
malts
in
the
first
few
sips
but
it
quickly
fades
as
the
beer
warms
and
the
flavor
seems
to
subside
and
become
one
brown
mass
low
abv
leads
to
a
good
session
beer
as
it
almost
runs
the
gamut
of
being
a
mild
ale
much
like
the
british
ales
this
beer
was
a
dark
brownish
color
with
a
moderate
tan
head
it
had
a
bitter
taste
to
it
and
had
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolete
in
it
the
head
disappears
rather
quickly
and
leaves
some
lace
on
the
glass
this
beer
was
ok
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
soon
it
just
seemed
very
different
then
what
i
am
used
to
in
brown
ales
not
very
sweet
very
hoppy
as
it
warmed
up
the
hops
dominated
even
more
and
i
liked
it
less
not
horrible
though
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
to
me
had
the
exact
mouthfeel
for
the
style
thin
in
the
british
session
ale
tradition
thus
its
excessively
drinkable
as
adherence
to
the
style
should
dictate
great
on
tap
in
nyc
good
in
bottles
a
good
beer
to
always
have
around
and
excellent
for
wooing
the
ignorant
into
beerdom
this
is
my
standard
for
the
style
i
got
this
with
a
sampler
case
so
i
could
try
a
couple
styles
for
the
forst
time
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
with
a
nice
12
inch
head
first
taste
the
rich
maltiness
nutty
coffee
flavor
enough
hops
to
balance
without
being
overbearing
very
drinkable
any
time
of
year
for
me
on
my
list
of
must
stock
beers
clear
ruddy
deep
chestnut
in
hue
thick
persistent
dense
tan

the
aroma
is
predominantly
of
dry
bakers
chocolate
and
stately
toffee
along
with
faintly
floral
hops
tame
biscuit
and
burnt
bread
upfront
in
flavor
ensued
by
mellow
cocoa
and
an
herbal
tinge
of
hops
salty
lightly
mineral
notes
mid
palate
along
with
hints
of
whole
wheat
cracker
mild
hop
bitterness
light
crisp
with
well
calculated
attenuation
and
residual
dextrins
finishes
mostly
clean
and
dry
with
fleeting
hints
of
molasses
and
savory
biscuit
a
no
frills
drinkable
brown
with
enough
character
to
keep
the
palate
interested
tasty
but
mostly
unremarkable
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
in
that
it
is
thick
enough
of
the
slight
richness
drinkability
is
good
its
nice
and
easy
and
not
too
rich
dark
brown
color
with
a
reddish
tint
the
head
goes
away
quickly
but
provides
decent
lacing
smells
very
nutty
and
complex
wonderful
aroma
tastes
clean
a
little
light
but
very
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
all
night
beers
made
by
brooklyn
brewery
best
by
july
2002
about
a
year
ago
so
i
will
take
this
into
account
just
i
will
not
pour
this
beer
out
must
sample
and
see
how
it
holds
up
appears
a
very
deep
amber
ruby
brown
with
a
cream
toffe
head
very
nice
looking
full
three
finger
sized
head
that
as
it
dwindles
leaves
even
pattern
of
trickled
lace
aroma
consists
of
pine
cone
like
hops
and
a
slightly
burnt
malt
character
the
two
aromas
blend
fairly
well
to
form
an
overall
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
is
a
bit
worn
by
the
age
but
i
can
still
detect
a
slightly
vinous
grap
character
blended
with
a
mild
chocolatecoffe
tone
and
the
hop
bitterness
works
well
together
overall
one
very
nice
session
beer
that
i
will
try
again
due
to
the
age
of
this
one

thanks
stegmakk
for
the
sample
a
deep

the

portly

spumescent

a
winsome
light
beige

color
and
a
thick
sticky
sheet
of
lace
to
conceal
the
glass
the
nose
is
sweet
malt
crisp
and
slightly
floral
a
real
treat
for
the
old
schnozzle
with
a
rich
malt
start
that
is
somewhat
sweet
and
the
top
fair
to
middling
in
feel
finish
has
a
perky
acidic
bite
the
hops
pounce
on
your
palate
like
the
brooklyn
dodgers
did
the
yankees
quite
dry
aftertaste
and
a
real
sweetheart
of
a
beer
and
a
real
keeper
in
my
book
one
of
the
first
things
that
struck
me
about
this
brown
ale
was
that
it
looked
almost
predominantly
red
rather
than
brown
the
actual
combination
of
these
two
colors
makes
for
a
rather
impressive
appearance
along
with
the
small
but
consistent
head
a
sweet
alcoholic
odor
mixed
with
a
subtle
roasted
fragrance
the
same
sweetness
coupled
with
a
caramel
or
toffee
flavor
comprised
this
ales
particularly
complex
taste
bitter
hints
were
also
present
along
with
a
bit
of
a
yeasty
or
grainy
taste
towards
the
end
this
ale
could
have
been
fuller
however
especially
to
complement
the
more
complex
taste
nothing
beyond
average
in
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
unfortunately
overall
the
brooklyn
brown
ale
had
a
good
sweet
somewhat
roasted
taste
that
allows
for
a
continuously
pleasurable
drinking
expereince
the
beer
tastes
good
and
will
not
disappoint
fans
of
a
darker
ale
this
brew
has
a
wonderful
flavor
sweet
maltiness
precedes
mellow
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
i
could
and
would
drink
this
all
night
great
aftertaste
as
well
as
others
have
mentioned
possibly
my
favorite
brown
ale
however
this
does
not
surprise
me
as
i
have
only
had
one
other
brown
ale
on
tap
newcastle
eh
right
brooklyns
effort
is
applauded
this
is
a
smooth
malty
flavorful
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
pours
a
medium
brown
with
ruby
hints
to
it
medium
white
head
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
doughy
chocolate
some
nuttiness
showing
through
and
a
very
minimal
hop
note
towards
the
end
flavor
is
mainly
chocolate
some
caramel
mildly
hoppy
finish
fairly
thin
in
the
mouth
feels
smooth
due
to
light
carbonation
a
thing
of
beauty
in
the
glass
liquid
mahogany
a
little
more
hoppedup
than
the
english
variety
of
brown
ale
but
still
retained
a
fairly
mineral
crispness
i
think
brown
ales
in
general
get
shortchanged
because
they
strive
for
a
certain
balance
rather
than
grabbing
attention
with
excess
or
novelty
this
is
a
wellcrafted
brown
with
good
drinkability
i
would
happily
drink
more
poured
a
dark
ambercopper
with
a
little
hazy
color
a
thick
white
head
that
is
gone
within
seconds
a
sweet
malt
aroma
is
giving
off
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
sweet
malts
a
slight
hint
of
hops
and
some
caramel
a
bit
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
a
smooth
taste
with
an
easy
going
drinkability
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
about
this
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
pours
a
real
dark
orange
gives
off
a
decent
off
white
head
doesn¬ít
leave
much
of
a
lace
aroma
was
a
bit
nutty
but
mostly
malt
somewhat
sweet
taste
was
the
nose
a
nutty
malt
flavor
a
bit
dry
and
bitter
at
the
finish
nothing
to
crazy
but
over
all
an
ok
beer
this
cask
conditioned
ale
poured
a
clear
dark
chocolate
brown
color
with
good
creamy
light
tan
foam
the
smell
was
modest
and
was
mostly
floral
hops
the
taste
was
initially
floral
hops
but
then
chocolate
malt
and
sweet
caramel
malt
flavors
poked
through
there
was
a
bit
of
floral
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
clean
with
a
slight
chocolate
aftertaste
this
was
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
from
cask
a
tasty
brown
ale
with
nice
maltiness
and
a
very
good
hop
load
pours
a
cherrywood
in
color
tan
creamy
lace
nose
is
spicy
hoppy
leathery
tobacco
medium
bodied
for
the
most
part
but
at
times
it
feels
a
little
thin
soft
caramel
malt
backbone
but
the
hops
are
what
really
stand
out
same
as
the
nose
spicy
leafy
leathery
very
nice
hop
flavor
finishes
on
a
dry
note
a
very
good
brown
ale
that
leans
more
hoppy
than
malty
a
wellpresented
chocolate
brown
brew
with
an
offwhite
head
that
stays
very
well
and
leaves
lots
of
lace
im
glad
i
poured
this
perfectly
its
the
only
bottle
ive
got
and
its
not
available
in
my
area
i
was
only
able
to
get
this
thanks
to
francisweizen
anyway
on
to
the
aroma
certainly
smells
like
a
wellhopped
beer
im
getting
hints
of
earthy
and
leafy
hops
chocolate
malt
makes
itself
known
quickly
combining
very
well
with
the
hops
a
bit
of
grainy
malt
character
is
detectable
under
all
of
this
as
for
the
flavors
it
looks
like
weve
got
a
winner
in
this
department
too
hops
are
really
leafy
throughout
hitting
their
peak
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
chocolate
malt
is
the
major
player
on
the
sweetness
side
making
itself
known
best
at
the
front
and
back
rindlike
hop
bitterness
balances
things
out
crisp
dry
finish
nice
medium
body
but
flavorful
not
much
complexity
but
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
that
will
satisfy
your
palate
well
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
id
definitely
get
this
again
a
good
product
not
overwhelming
in
any
sensegood
or
bad
but
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
any
time
i
brought
a
sixpack
over
to
2
different
friends
houses
people
who
dont
understand
good
beer
and
they
were
both
against
trying
it
preferring
their
amstels
or
buds
but
they
were
both
like
wow
when
they
tried
the
brooklyn
brown
it
will
not
turn
off
those
who
normally
drink
tasteless
from
beers
from
the
big
breweries
for
fellow
beer
advocates
dont
look
for
this
beer
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
will
satisfy
and
quench
your
beer
desire
this
is
very
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
as
others
have
said
it
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
many
different
people
have
selected
this
beer
from
the
store
i
work
in
and
i
figured
that
it
was
just
a
trendy
thing
since
not
too
many
people
actually
pick
good
ones
but
i
am
glad
i
finally
got
it
a
friend
said
you
havent
had
this
give
it
a
whirl
so
i
did
you
gotta
have
this
one
and
nice
hop
character
for
a
brown
well
done
for
an
american
brown
lower
alcohol
brew
easy
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
francisweizen
for
the
bottle
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
seems
a
lot
more
assertive
than
most
other
browns
ive
tried
vey
dark
amberruby
in
color
with
almost
no
head
at
all
aroma
is
dominated
by
rich
caramel
malt
with
a
nuttiness
than
becomes
more
assertive
as
the
beer
warms
the
flavor
is
quite
terrific
starts
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
develops
some
chocolatey
notes
midpalate
then
gives
way
to
a
satisfyingly
bitter
hop
finish
just
when
you
think
its
over
a
surprisingly
roasty
aftertaste
kicks
in
lending
an
extra
dryness
to
the
finish
and
leaving
you
yearning
for
another
sip
mediumfull
in
body
this
was
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
from
ba
to
swilldrinker
its
also
a
good
bargain
at
56
per
sixpack
just
one
of
the
best
beers
you
can
ever
get
at
that
price
drinkability
slight
alcohol
taste
but
drinks
very
easy
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
all
night
nice
color
very
little
headnice
chocolaty
aroma
nice
maltycocolate
flavors
with
earthy
undertones
just
like
a
good
brown
should
be

didnt
thin
out
towards
the
end
like
alot
of

ales
do
really
enjoyed
will
have
againhopefully
soon
f
coper
brown
beer
that
poured
with
a
minimal
head
looks
like
it
may
have
been
off
white
in
color
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
nutty
inviting
you
to
take
a
drink
the
atse
exhbits
a
strong
citrus
hope
note
then
the
malt
somewhat
dry
background
as
the
beer
warms
chocolate
notes
are
evident
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
enjoyable
the
hoppiness
adds
to
the
drinkability
and
creates
an
original
brown
offering
for
brooklyn
that
represents
the
style
but
duplicates
nothing
ive
had
before
nice
beer
that
i
will
buy
again

this
has
a
good
thick
taste
malts
some
hops
to
balance
and
an
appropriate
nutty
flavour
its
less
nutty
but
tastier
than
newcastle
a
good
beer
entirely
deserving
of
its
rating
ive
had
better
but
its
easier
to
find
worse
than
better
so
this
is
a
recommendation

the
one
that
i
use
to
introduce
most
people
to
the
style

the
frothy
light
tan
head
holds
fairly
well
and
drops
to
a

full
loaded
with
rich
bready
maltiness
and
spicy
floral
hops
the
body
is

with
a
gentle
carbonation
that
makes
it
lightly
creamy
in

the
flavor
displays
a
gently

lightly
toasty
and
toffeelike
malt

well
backed
by

its
unfortunate

better
versions
of
this
this
is
also

the
nose
as
well
there
are
some
nice
tastes
present
like
chocolate
malt
cocoa
and
hop
bitterness
i
have
come
across
few
brown
ales
that
make
me
stop
and
take
note
and
this
isnt
one
of
them
its
an
o
k
beer
from
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
pours
a
nice
amberbrown
with
a
creamy
head
and
a
nice
clinging
lace
smells
of
light
chocolate
caramel
and
some
malt
sweet
malt
taste
with
some
caramel
and
some
faint
bittersweet
chocolate
light
earthy
hops
provide
a
nice
bittering
compliment
to
the
sweetness
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
and
very
drinkable
i
really
like
this
beer
a
great
session
brew
also
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
body
that
it
is
light
enough
for
the
summer
and
heavy
enough
for
the
winter
i
dont
know
if
it
is
the
hops
or
what
put
basically
for
me
this
beer
is
just
too
bitter
it
smashed
me
over
the
head
with
bitterness
no
balance
and
not
the
usual
good
bitter
taste
that
i
find
in
so
many
other
brews
i
could
be
talking
out
my
ass
here
but
i
think
they
used
too
much
roasted
malt
which
imparts
a
rather
bitter
taste
to
begin
with
then
made
the
all
too
common
american
mirco
brewer
mistake
of
way
to
much
hop
bitterness
its
over
the
top
and
in
my
opinion
it
is
too
much
definitely
not
what
i
expected
i
think
it
could
be
more
balanced
not
my
style
just
had
this
on
draft
much
more
flavorful
than
the
nowtoneddown
petes
wicked
good
balance
of
maltiness
hops
very
full
taste
very
mellow
great
malt
flavor
has
enough
hops
to
keep
it
interesting
notes
a
nice
modern
day
american
brown
ale
on
the
dry
side
but
packed
with
a
fullness
of
flavours
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
off
white
head
that
lingers
appears
reddish
brown
aroma
is
light
but
very
pleasant
of
toasted
coconut
taste
of
vanilla
and
light
toasted
coconut
with
light
body
caramel
notes
emerge
as
it
warms
fantastic
concept
but
i
wish
there
was
more
body
or
sweetness
to
enhance
the
coconut
flavor
a
very
weakly
flavored
brown
ale
the
coconut
is
totally
undetectable
in
this
batch
it
is
at
best
unoffensive
overall
i
was
happily
surprised
by
this
i
am
not
a
huge
kona
fan
but
this
completely
made
me
turn
back
for
another
go
around
well
done
beer
two
things
i
really
loved
about
this
beer
the
price
and
the
taste
the
price
was
right
since
this
is
a
big
brewer
and
supply
is
ample
not
a
lot
of
other
beers
i
would
take
to
a
party
for
this
price
and
feel
like
im
taking
this
quality
the
taste
is
exactly
what
its
advertised
to
be
nutty
brown
ale
with
a
bunch
of
coconut
in
there
i
love
it
when
a
beer
gives
you
exactly
what
youre
expecting
not
saying
i
dont
enjoy
a
complex
brew
but
when
drinking
in
the
yard
with
friends
you
dont
need
to
go
crazy
on
in
depth
flavors
and
explanations
if
youre
a
fan
of
brown
ales
and
coconut
separately
than
combine
them
and
enjoy
a
tasty
beverage
just
drink
it
picked
this
one
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
at
ye
ole
outstanding
looking
beer
with
a
very
interesting
smell
not
the
normal
brown
smell
very
interesting
same
with
the
taste
you
definitely
notice
the
coconut
which
adds
some
uniqueness
to
the
flavor
that
i
really
like
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
and
would
certainly
be
wiling
to
buy
in
the
future
overall
a
great
beer
in
my
opinion
i
really
like
the
maltiness
of
this
beer
and
the
coconut
taste
is
wonderful
i
would
like
more
of
the
coconut
taste
to
come
out
but
still
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
a
brown
ale
that
looks
good
on
paper
but
pretty
much
fails
to
live
up
to
the
hype
the
malt
and
hop
marriage
doesnt
quite
gel
and
seems
to
have
a
slightly
offflavor
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
feel
lacks
depth
and
feels
watered
down
sure
you
get
some
deep
roasted
grain
flavors
with
some
chocolate
and
cocoa
notes
and
there
is
a
noticeable
though
not
overbearing
coconut
element
to
the
flavors
but
things
just
dont
seem
to
mesh
well
not
bad
but
hardly
a
strong
representative
of
a
good
brown
ale
o
overall
a
nice
addition
of
toasted
coconut
with
a
sweet
malt
body
makes
this
a
drinkable
brown
ale
that
was
well
balanced
and
worthy
of
multiples
overall
pretty
good
even
though
i
dont
like
coconut
o
they
could
have
gone
overboard
with
the
coconut
and
luckily
they
only
did
a
little
its
definitely
the
predominant
note
but
its
fresh
and
real
and
rounded
with
some
classic
malty
porter
notes
im
bringing
some
next
time
i
go
to
the
beach
poured
this
into
my
snifter
because
my
pint
glass
was
no
where
to
be
found
overall
nicely
crafted
brew
and
certainly
a
unique
offering
worthy
trying
o
im
a
big
coconut
fan
but
this
really
wasnt
what
i
was
hoping
for
the
coconut
never
quite
tasted
like
coconut
and
every
aspect
being
graded
was
weaker
than
i
prefer
i
dont
want
to
dis
kona
fire
rock
pale
ale
is
one
of
my
gotos
but
this
one
just
didnt
measure
up
for
me
if
you
like
brown
beer
and
are
a
fan
of
coconut
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
just
tried
it
for
the
first
time
reasonable
price
5
on
tap
the
coconut
aroma
lets
your
taste
buds
know
whats
coming
good
bite
and
flavor
smooth
on
the
palate
best
brown
ive
tried
yet
poured
into
a
glass
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
red
glow
the
coconut
is
obvious
on
the
nose
dominates
the
aroma
however
it
is
much
harder
to
actually
taste
as
far
as
ales
go
there
is
not
much
that
sets
this
one
apart
that
being
said
this
is
still
a
very
drinkable
drink
that
grows
on
you
nice
caramel
brown
color
thick
head
that
leaves
nice
traces
on
the
top
as
well
as
the
glass
its
a
bitey
brown
and
what
got
me
to
try
this
in
the
first
place
did
not
disappoint
thats
the
toasted
coconut
the
subtile
aftertaste
of
the
coconut
is
amazing
as
well
as
the
other
flavors
that
pop
up
such
as
macadamia
and
almond
i
can
only
dream
and
assume
how
well
this
beer
will
go
with
some
pineapple
and
glazed
ham
aloha
i
have
tried
every
american
brown
ale
and
specialty
brown
ales
available
in
my
area
and
even
the
rouge
hazelnut
or
dogfish
heads
brown
ale
does
not
touch
this
one
in
my
opinion
it
just
smells
amazing
and
tastes
so
good
in
summer
or
winter
i
buy
cases
of
it
when
it
comes
out
and
never
want
to
drink
the
last
ones
would
love
to
try
on
tap
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
bottled
on
1252013
pours
crystal
clear
ruby
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
dense
light
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
with
some
light
streaming
carbonation
aromas
of
big
caramel
chocolate
coconut
toffee
toast
brown
bread
brown
sugar
vanilla
light
nuttiness
herbal
floral
and
toasted
earthiness
damn
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
and
complexity
of
darkbready

and
coconut
notes
with
good
strength
taste
of
big

of

chocolate
coconut
toffee
toast
brown
bread
brown
sugar
vanilla
herbal
and
toasted
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
very
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
darkbready
malt
coconut
and
light
earthy
hop
flavors
with
nice
robustness
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
moderately
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
brown
ale
all
around
good
balance
complexity
and
robustness
of
darkbready
malt
and
coconut
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
drinkable
but
unlikely
something
i
will
revisit
in
hawaii
overall
a
nice
brown
ale
the
coconut
brings
this
up
a
few
notches
and
add
a
good
flavor
to
the
beer
o
a
wellmade
quaffable
brew
depth
in
flavor
and
body
is
unfortunately
held
back
the
one
time
ive
had
this
on
tap
the
flavors
were
more
bold
and
the
feel
smooth
and
more
fulfilling
so
i
suppose
the
carbonation
in
this
particular
bottle
hurt
it
overall
koko
brown
is
an
averageatbest
brown
ale
if
you
like
coconut
this
would
be
a
nice
choice
especially
on
a
very
hot
day
as
it
isnt
at
all
heavy
and
it
would
be
easy
to
have
a
few
im
not
sure
id
buy
it
again
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
say
no
to
a
bottle
or
a
pint
3
55
overall
just
because
i
could
see
this
being
a
solid
choice
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
wish
the
coconut
stood
out
a
little
more
and
had
more
sweetness
seems
more
of
a
general
roasted
nut
taste
to
me
a
rare
specialty
beer
that
works
brown
drinkers
coconut
fans
and
someone
looking
for
a
dark
that
doesnt
have
the
same
old
profile
will
find
something
to
enjoy
here
o
great
beer
im
a
fan
o
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
so
many
murican
brown
ales
go
the
balanced
route
yet
arent
really
that
delicate
or
sophisticated
to
compensate
for
its
less
exciting
flavor
profile
but
this
is
brown
ale
is
a
hitormiss
style
with
me
this
isnt
an
emphatic
hit
but
damnit
its
a
hit
nonetheless
overall
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
not
too
bad
but
also
far
from
great
or
inspiring
something
is
missing
here
i
really
really
want
to
like
these
kona
beers
but
something
just
keeps
holding
me
back
of
all
the
konas
i
have
had
this
one
is
by
far
the
best
the
koko
brown
has
a
rich
brown
color
with
a
frothy
head
that
has
staying
power
the
scent
and
taste
is
definitely
strong
in
the
roasted
area
and
distant
with
regards
to
coconut
almost
a
good
blend
the
mouthfeel
is
bold
and
thick
complementing
the
full
ale
flavor
however
overall
i
had
to
be
honest
with
myself
and
grade
them
almost
outstanding
close
but
just
no
cigar
this
is
pretty
much
what
i
like
in
a
brown
ale
relatively
sweet
but
with
some
nutty
bitterness
to
balance
with
just
a
little
complexity
but
overall
rather
simple
i
seldom
see
this
where
i
live
although
the
other
flavors
of
kona
are
generally
available
i
picked
this
up
in
a
three
bears
alaska
store
for
about
7
50
a
sixer
cheap
amber
color
no
head
has
a
sweet
vanilla
and
coconut
aroma
and
flavor
body
is
a
bit
on
the
sickly
sweet
side
but
the
carbonation
cuts
that
away
in
the
finish
has
a
creamy
mediumbody
feel
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
another
one
of
my
favorite
beers
beautiful
mahogany
color
nice
aroma
velvety
mouth
feel
and
a
finish
that
leaves
me
ready
for
another
one
the
coconut
flavors
really
come
out
after
warming
up
a
bit
overall
a
really
great
balance
between
hops
and
malts
and
a
unique
and
tasty
combination
of
flavors
bottle
poured
in
a
pint
glass
smell
is
pleasant
enough
a
little
malty
sweetness
and
some
toasted
notes
no
discernable
coconut
however
mouthfeel
comes
up
short
very
thin
feeling
makes
me
go
back
for
another
sip
but
has
me
looking
for
something
more
taste
is
nice
sweet
malt
is
back
again
along
with
the
toast
after
really
trying
i
get
the
coconut
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
at
all
a
decent
brown
ale
but
nothing
special
and
if
i
didnt
say
coconut
i
probably
would
never
have
known
deep
mahogany
brown
in
color
a
quarter
inch
of
of
white
foam
rests
on
top
brussels
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
coconut
and
caramelized
malt
theres
definitely
a
sweetness
that
dominates
the
mouth
is
a
bit
carbonated
and
warm
theres
bit
of
a
cloying
aspect
between
the
caramelized
malt
and
the
intense
sweetness
from
the
coconut
the
taste
is
an
intense
dark
maltiness
that
is
quickly
overwhelmed
by
the
sweet
coconut
points
for
nice
coconut
flavor
a
few
moments
latter
i
sniffed
the
glass
and
swiftly
took
my
first
full
sip
wham
i
was
hit
by
the
coconut
the
more
i
drank
the
more
the
coconut
overpowered
it
was
so
good
out
of
the
bottle
i
really
wanted
to
like
the
glass
i
couldnt
finish
maybe
ill
give
it
another
try
but
keep
it
in
the
bottle
possibly
im
overwhelmed
by
the
coconut
aroma
and
i
liked
the
first
sip
out
of
the
bottle
because
my
nose
wasnt
in
the
glass
o
tasty
brew
i
love
coconut
in
brews
it
adds
a
smoothness
and
cuts
the
bitterness
in
dark
ales
and
leaves
you
with
a
creaminess
great
drinkability
not
overdone
but
well
done
overall
a
pleasantly
balanced
beer
i
was
afraid
that
the
coconut
flavor
would
either
be
nonexistent
or
over
powering
it
was
neither
you
get
a
pleasant
hint
of
coconut
that
blends
nicely
with
the
overall
nuttiness
of
the
beer
its
especially
nice
to
drink
during
the
winter
dreaming
of
warmer
tropical
days
i
have
tried
every
american
brown
ale
and
specialty
brown
ales
available
in

and
even
the

or

pours
a
medium
mahogany
brown
with

thin
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
to
patchy
foam
and
a
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
of
coconut
caramel
malt
slightly
nutty
flavor
is
biscuit
malt
sweet
coconut
nuts
with
a
light
grassy
hop
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
a
light
bodied
brown
ale
with
a
well
balanced
but
assertive
coconut
flavor
which
has
a
slightly
artificial
taste
a
pleasant
fun
to
drink
ale
that
definitely
leaves
a
tropical
feeling
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
browns
but
the
allure
of
coconut
on
a
cold
snowy
night
was
too
much
so
i
grabbed
a
single
and
gave
it
a
shot
sleek
deep
chestnut
appearance
with
about
half
inch
of
head
which
receded
relatively
quickly
with
minimal
spotty
lacing
aroma
was
all
of
the
coconut
i
was
looking
for
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
smooth
with
the
moderate
carbonation
and
the
taste
was
a
pleasant
blend
of
brown
ale
nuttiness
coconut
sweetness
and
a
lightly
bitter
finish
overall
i
would
say
its
a
pretty
tasty
beer
was
a
great
way
to
fill
a
craving
but
not
necessarily
something
i
would
run
out
and
buy
otherwise
i
cant
believe
i
havent
rated
this
beer
yet
the
best
brown
ale
i
have
ever
tried
and
followed
closely
by
bells
best
brown
ale
the
2
are
so
similar
other
than
the
koko
brown
has
coconut
flavor
take
everything
i
said
in
my
review
of
best
brown
and
add
the
coconut
and
its
so
undiscribable
overallcomments
a
very
good
brown
ale
that
is
very
drinkable
with
a
tasty
flavor
profile
that
is
worth
a
try
i
would
def
drink
again
but
wouldnt
seek
out
and
buy
this
classified
as
an
american
brown
ale

o
unexpectedly
good
the
coconut
is
the
most
pronounced
of
any
coconut
infused
beer
ive
had
and
it
works
well
in
a
brown
ale
will
have
again
this
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
slight
beige
head
there
isnt
much
to
the
aroma
but
a
slight
scent
of
coconut
the
flavor
is
dark
complex
and
full
of
coconut
this
is
pretty
unique
and
the
best
part
is
it
tastes
good
too
a
well
made
brew
from
that
far
southwest
state
wow
am
i
torn
on
this
one
not
much
of
a
beer
but
man
does
it
taste
like
all
the
best
parts
of
coconut
lush
and
tropical
if
all
they
did
was
add
toasted
coconut
to
the
secondary
then
i
need
to
double
down
for
my
next
coconut
porter
sessionable
onedimensional
gimmicky
and
darn
tasty
o
ive
had
a
lot
of
this
beer
one
of
the
things
i
like
about
it
is
that
its
a
unique
flavor
with
the
coconut
without
being
over
bearing
kona
does
a
nice
job
of
adding
unique
ingredients
without
making
it
taste
gimmicky
i
love
this
beer
overall
i
happen
to
like
coconut
and
mounds
are
one
of
my
favorite
candies
not
that
i
am
a
big
candy
eater
so
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
prefer
it
if
it
were
a
coconut
porter
but
it
is
what
it
is
decent
brown
ale
but
lacks
in
hops
for
an
american
style
coconut
was
a
nice
complement
let
me
close
out
by
saying
i
generally
hate
the
taste
of
coconut
besides
when
its
in
coconut
shrimp
and
those
girl
scout
cookies
with
coconut
in
them
that
being
said
i
liked
this
beer
and
even
though
it
was
odd
for
a
brown
ale
the
coconut
seemed
to
work
in
the
brew
this
is
a
one
trick
pony
and
has
a
very
basic
flavor
yet
somehow
the
coconut
and
vanilla
made
this
enjoyable
to
me
not
all
that
impressive
a
bit
clear
from
the
pour
led
to
a
watery
feel
that
ruined
this
the
verdict
different
its
pretty
good
and
the
coconut
isnt
too
heavy
but
im
not
sure
if
im
drinking
a
beer
eating
a
mounds
bar
or
swallowing
a
red
rock
cola
i
actually
had
my
first
koko
brown
when
my
wife
and
i
were
on
vacation
in
waikiki
so
i
had
to
make
it
one
of
my
first
kegs
kona
had
just
started
to
distribute
to
ohio
a
nice
production
from
the
island
poured
into
a
pint
glass
at
first
i
thought
it
was
a
dark
brown
but
it
has
more
red
tints
in
the
light
great
smell
of
vanilla
and
coconut
and
not
overbearing
the
taste
really
brought
out
more
of
a
toasted
coconut
and
reminded
me
of
an
unsweetened
macaroon
i
mean
that
as
a
good
thing
too
it
didnt
have
the
sticky
aftertaste
i
was
expecting
and
that
was
refreshing
id
gladly
have
another
one
overall
im
fairly
impressed
by
this
beer
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
but
a
solid
change
up
from
the
types
of
beers
that
tend
to
be
so
popular
these
days
surprisingly
refreshing
for
a
brown
ale
my
pour
was
creating
a
good
bit
of
head
so
i
backed
off
to
allow
it
to
settle
a
little
before
proceeding
i
started
with
close
to
two
fingers
of
foamy
lighttan
head
but
the
intense
carbonation
caused
it
to
bubble
and
burp
its
way
out
of
existence
truth
in
advertising
strikes
again
it
was
indeed
a
mahoganybrown
with
neplus
quality
clarity
enabling
me
to
see
through
walls
the
neighbors
need
to
let
the
dog
out
apparently
nose
was
rich
with
caramel
and
coconut
and
i
was
reminded
of
a
peanuts
strip
in
which
linus
or
lucy
had
a
box
of
chocolates
and
inadvertently
chose
a
coconut
and
then
made
a
face
i
remember
thinking
that
i
liked
coconut
as
a
kid
and
especially
my
grandmothers
pound
cake
with
coconut
frosting
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
initially
rich
with
coconut
but
then
the
caramel
and
chocolate
of
the
malt
began
to
kick
in
and
it
was
like
liquid
candy
finish
was
decidedly
sweet
and
you
had
best
like
coconut
going
into
it
because
that
was
the
lingering
flavor
i
can
promise
you
that
this
type
of
thing
is
not
usually
my
bag
but
as
an
occasional
step
away
from
intense
hops
i
liked
it
you
have
to
decide
for
yourself
as
to
whether
it
would
be
to
your
taste
i
was
really
not
expecting
to
like
this
beer
at
all
but
man
homerun
the
toasted
coconut
flavors
and
the
toasted
brown
malt
go
together
like
peanut
butter
and
chocolate
a
perfect
match
a
great
session
beer
but
could
also
go
really
well
with
dessert
id
vote
for
chocolate
ice
cream
on
a
warm
day
d
not
so
bad
but
the
natural
flavor
added
never
works
for
me
strangely
refreshing
however
if
youre
thirsty
and
unoffensive
overall
a
wellmade
brew
but
i
would
have
liked
more
coconut
character
the
toasting
seemed
to
have
diminished
the
coconut
flavor
and
the
tropical
fruit
aromaflavor
masked
it
as
well
i
poured
this
nice
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
mahogany
color
and
poured
a
really
pretty
nice
tan
head
the
smell
was
yummy
tasty
and
complex
the
taste
was
yummylishious
with
coconut
mounds
bar
type
thing
going
on
a
really
interesting
beer
i
will
buy
this
again
foe
sure
a
really
good
beer
the
beer
pours
a
mahogany
brown
with
a
head
of
medium
sized
soap
bubbles
on
top
that
bubble
and
fizzle
into
a
scrim
over
the
beer
the
beers
body
is
clean
and
clear
though
dark
from
the
malts
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
chocolaty
almost
to
a
syrupy
level
there
is
a
nice
gentle
roast
that
reminds
the
nose
of
coffee
caramel
and
just
a
light
hint
of
coconut
nuttiness
but
chocolate
seems
to
be
the
big
player
in
the
nose
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
and
slightly
savory
with
a
lot
of
syntheticlike
flavors
coming
through
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
light
chocolate
and
moves
into
a
slight
coconut
flavor
that
gives
slightly
plasticy
flavors
these
flavors
crescendo
into
a
short
finish
of
mediocre
chocolate
caramel
plasticcoconut
and
slight
biscuity
malts
the
aftertaste
is
light
and
slightly
roasty
with
hints
of
chocolate
to
me
the
flavors
suggest
a
watereddown
english
brown
ale
with
very
slight
hints
of
coconut
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
light
side
of
medium
in
body
with
a
weak
carbonation
that
simply
peppers
the
tongue
and
then
washes
away
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
dry
with
a
touch
of
wet
saliva
overall
i
am
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
i
want
more
coconut
flavor
and
i
want
a
thicker
beer
the
flavors
are
not
disgusting
but
just
come
off
as
meh
overall
a
great
try
for
me
as
im
not
gonna
get
to
the
islands
any
time
soon
to
get
one
on
draft
d
somewhat
unique
and
lighter
on
the
coconut
than
i
was
expecting
still
still
tasty
and
sessionable
a
little
gimmicky
but
still
pretty
fun
to
drink
toasted
malt
a
little
nutty
toffee
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
fill
in
nutty
toasted
coconut
flavor
develops
and
gets
pretty
strong
toward
the
finish
hints
of
vanilla
and
licorice
lingering
coconut
and
toffee
sweetness
in
the
finish
medium
to
moderate
body
with
a
somewhat
slick
feel
not
bad
but
not
one
i
would
want
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
eh
not
the
best
brown
ale
out
there
i
appreciate
the
creativity
but
this
one
was
a
flop
in
my
opinion
eric
overall
kona
recently
showed
up
in
mn
so
i
picked
up
a
single
of
this
the
coconut
flavor
does
come
through
but
theres
an
artificial
vanilla
flavor
that
just
takes
over
too
much
of
the
palate
having
a
little
more
roast
or
coffee
base
with
the
coconut
could
be
very
good
just
missed
the
mark
here
taste
was
excellent
the
coconut
was
subtle
which
is
good
because
it
could
easily
overpower
a
brew
nice
and
smooth
to
drink
if
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
great
beer
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
repurchasing
glad
to
see
it
finally
available
here
id
been
wanting
to
try
this
o
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
a
good
commercial
coconut
brown
ale
and
this
was
not
it
lots
of
artificial
flavors
and
more
like
a
soda
pop
than
a
beer
made
it
a
bit
hard
to
finish
the
bottle
o
this
was
basically
toasted
coconut
butter
in
a
glass
if
thats
your
thing
knock
yourself
out
im
not
a
vegan
so
i
only
sample
the
stuff
from
time
to
time
after
about
eight
of
the
twelve
ounces
poured
from
this
bottle
have
been
consumed
i
finally
got
it
it
smells
like
whiskey
jack
daniels
and
brown
sugar
this
is
not
a
note
that
i
have
before
experienced
in
a
brown
ale
but
it
works
in
this
one
whiskey
and
toasted
kokonut
make
this
a
unique
brewand
unlike
many
sweet
ales
it
tastes
as
if
it
is
stronger
rather
than
weaker
than
the
actual
alcohol
content
it
tastes
like
hard
alcoholwhiskeybut
instead
its
only
wait
it
does
not
say
what
percent
on
the
bottle
beeradvocate
says
its
5
5
but
the
spot
on
the
bottle
where
the
abv
was
listed
on
other
kona
brews
is
just
empty
space
on
the
koko
brown
label
i
guess
i
should
be
ready
if
i
start
feeling
hammered
since
it
did
taste
just
like
jd
a
solid
brown
ale
with
an
island
twist
great
toasty
flavor
o
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
its
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
and
has
sort
of
a
strange
syrupy
feel
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
get
it
separately
or
on
tap
yum
desert
beer
overall
greater
i
am
going
to
have
again
while
i
think
it
might
have
slightly
too
much
bite
its
a
wellrounded
mouthfeel
with
a
good
creaminess
and
ample
carbonation
is
a
body
hefty
enough
to
hold
it
together
without
being
too
thick
or
heavy
medium
body
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
copper
color
topped
with
a
small
but
sticky
and
lush
looking
head
ample
lacing
rich
coconut
enveloping
aromas
of
toasted
malt
hazelnut
and
a
wee
bit
of
chocolate
the
toasted
coconut
of
course
continues
into
the
flavor
nutty
caramel
mild
cocoa
maple
and
vanilla
pretty
good
crisp
drinkable
not
too
sweet
not
too
clean
i
think
id
actually
bring
some
along
to
the
beach
if
it
was
available
in
the
summer
months
at
first
sip
i
was
like
whoa
thats
pretty
good
a
light
to
medium
body
not
overwhelming
in
flavor
mostly
coconut
maple
hazelnut
and
toffeecoffee
but
light
it
sits
fairly
flat
but
when
you
take
a
nice
sip
it
opens
up
and
is
very
creamy
and
burst
in
your
mouth
and
fully
opens
up
washes
down
clean
and
refreshing
and
leaves
your
mouth
wet
and
ready
for
more
not
overly
swee
or
filling
and
is
very
drinkable
ill
have
another
kona
just
recently
started
distributing
to
ohio
so
im
confused
why
wed
get
bottles
born
in
november
2012
im
assuming
this
isnt
the
freshest
but
its
still
solid
the
potential
is
there
to
be
something
unique
for
the
style
id
like
to
try
this
fresher
because
im
assuming
the
coconut
would
be
more
prevelant
this
could
be
awesome
when
fresh
dark
like
a
porter
coconut
brown
sugar
toasted
malt
stay
thirsty
my
friends
o
this
is
a
unique
brew
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
coconut
but
it
works
i
never
had
a
beer
with
coconut
in
it
before
but
then
again
before
i
started
drinking
craft
beers
i
never
would
have
thought
adding
chocolate
to
a
beer
was
a
good
idea
either
i
enjoyed
this
one
probably
because
they
didnt
over
do
it
gonna
try
another
one
next
time
i
have
coconut
shrimp
and
see
how
it
pairs
with
that
overall
this
was
good
enjoyed
the
coconut
very
much
perhaps
the
coconut
flavor
is
a
little
too
strong
for
me
ill
leave
it
it
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
it
has
an
off
white
head
with
nice
lacing
and
decent
retention
the
aroma
is
filled
with
toasted
coconut
and
hints
of
caramel
the
coconut
transfers
over
the
the
taste
very
well
but
its
not
overpowering
like
i
feared
it
would
be
instead
it
collaborates
with
malt
and
bitter
cocoa
for
a
very
nice
very
well
rounded
taste
the
finish
is
very
mild
with
a
kiss
of
bitterness
its
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
very
drinkable
found
this
an
enjoyable
brown
with
decent
flavor
i
could
see
me
buying
this
again
taste
is
very
coconutty
with
more
of
the
chocolate
hint
featuring
alongside
very
enjoyable
theres
also
a
slight
hint
of
hops
late
in
the
finish
bringing
this
around
full
circle
i
dig
this
brew
and
will
be
revisiting
the
toasted
coconut
gives
this
brown
ale
a
nice
flare
the
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
with
very
thin
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
smell
includes
spice
and
a
touch
of
cocnut
the
taste
definitely
has
toasted
coconut
which
also
provides
a
bit
of
roastyness
in
addition
there
is
definitely
some
breadbiscuit
flavor
and
also
decent
balancing
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
good
brown
with
an
interesting
kick
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
a
clear
medium
brown
color
with
a
small
cap
of
offwhite
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
ringlet
sweet
malt
aroma
toasted
coconut
brown
sugar
the
taste
was
pretty
sugary
caramel
malts
coconut
candy
maybe
a
bit
of
milk
chocolate
not
as
good
as
it
may
sound
it
was
pretty
artificialtasting
lightmedium
body
not
entirely
bad
and
definitely
worth
a
try
but
not
something
id
ever
get
again
overall
an
average
brown
ale
that
doesnt
really
bring
much
to
the
table
in
terms
of
coconut
i
dont
really
go
for
brown
ales
to
begin
with
so
this
didnt
wow
me
average
at
best
light
bodied
wit
average
carbonation
and
a
toasted
bread
and
coconut
aftertaste
a
nice
effort
from
kona
overall
there
may
be
some
biased
here
but
i
visited
kona
brew
co
on
my
honeymoon
great
beers
i
especially
like
this
one
overall
a
pretty
decent
brown
ale
very
coconut
forward
and
on
the
sweeter
side
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
if
you
like
coconut
in
a
brown
ale
this
is
where
you
go
if
you
dont
stay
the
hell
away
overall
ill
be
honest
this
beer
was
decent
enough
to
plow
through
a
six
pack
in
90
minutes
a
hair
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
much
less
so
than
some
other
brown
ales
ive
attempted
tastetoasted
coconut
toasted
malt
a
nice
little
bite
in
the
finish
seems
to
balance
everything
out
a
bit
thinbodied
but
nice
flavor
and
balance
sessionable
good
with
a
burger
or
bbq
wings
this
beer
can
be
bought
in
keg
form
which
is
distributed
by
anheuserbusch
can
only
be
bought
in
bottle
form
seasonal
i
love
the
roasted
coconut
taste
and
i
love
coconut
the
toasted
mahogany
flavor
comes
out
not
the
avg
brown
ale
it
delivered
what
the
beer
is
advertising
just
not
enough
going
on
to
warrant
a
good
score
just
slightly
above
average
if
the
chocolate
flavor
in
this
brew
was
sweeter
i
think
it
would
taste
kinda
like
an
almond
joy
othis
might
not
be
for
everyone
but
it
is
for
me
a
top
notch
flavored
brown
ale
i
would
love
to
have
this
and
tyranenas
rockys
revenge
bourbon
barrel
aged
brown
on
hand
at
all
times
for
my
brown
ales
in
my
dream
bar
o
decent
beer
if
you
like
coconut
its
definitely
not
an
outstanding
beer
and
theres
not
much
to
back
up
the
coconut
but
its
a
nice
change
and
its
well
balanced
sounds
like
the
name
of
a
bad
blaxploitation
flick
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
rubycopper
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandy
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
lightlytoasted
coconut
and
very
little
else
if
anything
though
a
hint
of
wet
grass
may
or
may
not
find
its
way
through
at
some
points
despite
this
not
being
the
strongest
of
smells
in
the
world
it
does
get
to
be
a
bit
much
at
times
the
taste
adds
in
a
bit
of
caramely
toffee
but
this
is
still
mostly
drowned
out
by
the
coconut
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slickish
feel
overall
this
beer
seems
to
deliver
on
one
of
its
promises
it
certainly
has
some
coconut
in
it
beyond
that
though
not
much
else
is
going
on
its
a
sad
excuse
for
a
brown
ale
with
nearly
none
of
the
characteristics
of
the
style
and
its
one
note
song
gets
to
be
tiresome
after
a
relatively
short
while
this
looks
and
feels
like
a
great
brown
ale
but
the
overly
aggressive
coconut
ruins
it
toffee
with
a
hint
of
coconut
plus
a
little
chocolate
powder
toasted
and
roasted
malt
flavors
of
biscuits
and
pumpernickel
bread
crust
mouthfeel
is
a
little
syrupy
but
smooth
and
easy
the
rest
of
the
way
easy
to
drink
and
you
can
taste
just
enough
coconut
which
is
a
big
plus
for
me
mouth
feel
light
to
slightly

bodied

i
include
this
with
each
bottlecan
review
because
i
feel
that
for
the
average
consumer
to
even
approach
an
unknown
beer
its
the
packaging
that
entices
rather
than
the
actual

product

brewers
notes
and
ease
of

reuse
an
interesting
idea
with
some
good
flavour
combinations
but
the
execution
is
flawed
it
smells
pretty
good
even
if
some
of
the
flavours
seem
artificial
added
perhaps
the
taste
is
lacking
some
nice
malt
and
coconut
flavours
up
front
but
these
vanish
like
shadows
in
the
light
leaving
a
faint
lingering
sweetness
no
depth
the
body
is
poor
watery
and
insubstantial
when
the
flavour
demands
a
thick
smooth
unctuousness
its
drinkable
enough
but
could
use
improvement
worth
trying
o
a
soso
appearance
and
a
lackluster
aroma
diminish
expectations
but
the
flavor
really
makes
up
for
the
initial
shortcomings
this
really
has
a
great
coconut
and
nutty
flavor
making
this
a
veritable
liquid
candy
bar
glad
to
find
this
random
bottle
kicking
around
a
seldom
visited
store
today
not
the
freshest
but
this
is
holding
up
nicely
glad
i
was
able
to
find
this
o
tasty
i
would
have
another
but
probably
not
buy
6
decent
didnt
really
taste
like
a
brown
ale
but
was
still
very
enjoyable
o
a
refreshing
beer
especially
when
sampled
in
hawaii
it
lacks
the
malty
character
expected
in
a
brown
ale
but
is
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
two

o
a
dry
than
average
version
of
an
american
brown
with
a
light
touch
of
coconut
the
base
brown
style
is
better
than
average
with
some
great
toasty
malt
aromas
of
chocolate
and
caramel
that
is
complimented
with
the
addition
of
toasted
coconut
o
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
coconut
beer
but
i
was
left
with
a
little
disappointment
a
little
too
sweet
and
overly
toasted
i
prefer
the
other
coconut
flavored
beer
from
hawaii
maui
not
being
a
big
fan
of
either
brown
ales
in
general
or
coconut
as
a
flavour
i
saved
his
one
for
a
thirsty
night
after
a
hot
day
dark
brown
colour
with
slightly
sweet
aroma
not
as
sweet
malt
as
many
other
browns
i
have
tried
the
result
a
pretty
drinkable
brown
ale
toasty
with
some
complexity
a
bit
assertive
carbonation
sweetish
with
a
tad
of
bitterness
the
appearance
of
a
label
can
get
my
attention
and
this
one
did
poured
into
a
glass
it
had
a
shortlived
head
the
color
is
brown
and
appears
attractive
i
never
was
into
coconut
and
the
taste
is
without
a
doubt
dominated
by
coconut
so
i
didnt
go
much
farther
than
a
few
tastes
5
00
o
i
fucking
love
this
beer
never
let
it
go
stay
in
my
life
forever
but
not
like
married
like
one
of
serveral
girlfriends
that
i
can
call
upon
antime
overall
a
nice
twist
on
the
brown
ale
by
kona
brewing
i
would
have
preferred
more
coconut
in
the
beer
but
otherwise
it
has
some
nice
warm
flavours
mouthfeel
this
appear
to
pour
on
the
thin
side
and
my
palate
agrees
with
the
pour
rather
thin
and
weak
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
bottled
on
april
03
2012
this
pours
a
clear
light
brown
color
with
a
short
lived
off
white
head
the
smells
are
of
coconut
nuts
other
malts
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
pretty
sweet
and
not
too
bad
lots
of
sweet
coconut
it
overpower
everything
else
a
different
twist
on
a
american
brown
ale
definitely
worth
a
try
in
my
opinion
i
have
been
having
some
brews
from
kona
lately
and
for
the
most
part
they
do
a
good
job
which
holds
true
here
as
well
o
this
beer
is
very
interesting
and
i
think
that
the
addition
of
the
toasted
sweetened
coconut
makes
this
example
of
american
brown
ale
a
little
different
a
little
too
sweet
too
be
sessionable
but
definitely
drinkable
o
very
drinkable
great
coconut
flavor
without
overpowering
the
brew
i
really
liked
the
smell
but
the
coconut
just
overpowered
everything
in
the
taste
too
bad
about
a
third
to
half
the
coconut
would
make
this
a
really
winner
and
let
the
rest
of
the
ale
show
through
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
think
the
malt
backbone
is
balanced
and
a
nice
complimentary
coconut
note
kinda
average
in
the
glass
clear
cola
brown
with
a
two
finger
soapy
head
mild
malt
and
toasted
bread
notes
in
the
nose
again
a
bready
sweetness
with
chocolate
and
coconut
flavors
on
the
tongue
clean
finish
with
a
mild
bitterness
some
notes
of
charcoal
light
crisp
feel
with
a
bit
of
weight
to
it
a
nice
drinkable
beer
but
just
that
the
thought
of
coconut
in
a
beer
was
very
enticing
but
overall
pretty
disappointing
effort
wont
buy
again
o
i
wish
the
coconut
was
stronger
in
this
beer
as
its
advertised
up
in
front
on
the
package
however
its
a
nice
change
up
to
the
standard
light
summer
ales
i
normally
drink
would
buy
again
amazingly
savory
and
deliciously
smooth
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
take
shorter
sips
in
order
to
let
the
beer
last
longer
in
the
glass
but
then
theres
the
greedy
part
that
wants
to
devour
it
all
way
too
quickly
with
only
12
ounces
in
my
glass
i
have
quite
a
quandary
o
its
a
bit
of
a
novelty
with
the
chocolate
and
coconut
flavors
but
if
those
are
your
things
you
should
try
it
not
an
everyday
beer
but
a
good
one
nonetheless
bottle
home
i
bought
this
on
a
whim
it
sounded
interesting
the
beer
looks
like
a
brown
should
the
aroma
was
wonderful
like
chocolate
milk
and
coconut
toasted
coconut
is
front
and
center
in
the
flavor
theres
also
a
nice
hazelnutty
chocolate
caramel
malty
and
light
toffee
flavor
a
touch
watery
but
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
somewhat
onedimensional
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
caramel
and
a
small
citrus
note
in
the
tastecocoa
powder
and
a
small
caramel
roast
a
small
bite
and
a
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
orange
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
big
cocoa
in
taste
lots
of
orange
citrus
but
just
above
average
d
honestly
i
hate
coconut
if
that
is
your
thing
it
could
be
enjoyable
even
then
i
find
it
slightly
watery
not
my
favorite
but
not
a
bad
brew
o
while
this
beer
does
have
some
bumpy
spots
its
still
a
drinkable
brew
o
aromas
and
flavors
are
mild
but
too
discrete
to
my
taste
though
its
an
unusual
and
pleasant
beer
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
very
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
o
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
definitely
plays
to
the
coconut
side
of
the
beer
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
dark
brown
color
body
with
a
little
head
that
lays
down
quickly
the
smell
has
some
vanilla
notes
and
some
coconut
hints
to
it
the
taste
is
down
right
awesome
i
get
that
toasted
coconut
flavor
up
front
and
then
the
richness
of
the
brown
ale
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
it
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
overall
a
darn
good
beer
o
what
a
find
i
grabbed
a
sixer
to
share
with
my
pops
and
he
now
proclaims
this
his
favorite
beer
of
alltime
me
it
may
not
be
my
goat
but
its
worlds
better
then
i
was
expecting
you
can
bet
your
ass
that
ill
be
reaching
for
this
one
anytime
i
wanna
split
a
beer
with
my
dad
my
thumbs
are
certainly
up
for
what
is
konas
finest
bottled
brew
to
date
overalli
will
not
drink
this
beer
again
i
love
coconut
but
not
in
my
beer
the
idea
surrounding
coconut
in
beer
sounds
interesting
but
when
it
comes
down
to
drinking
it
ill
take
another
brown
beer
instead
nice
try
pours
a
dark
lightly
hazed
and
reddish
tinted
brown
minimal
cap
of
off
white
head
scent
leads
with
toasted
coconut
hints
of
vanilla
and
toasted
crusty
bread
mellows
into
notes
of
toasted
nuts
and
grain
light
brown
sugar
and
caramel
taste
of
toasted
coconut
is
quite
intense
in
the
first
sip
brings
more
vanilla
rounds
into
a
full
toasted
bread
profile
with
light
brown
sugar
notes
medium
bodied
slightly
low
in
carbonation
lacing
heft
found
in
the
style
im
torn
with
this
beer
the
idea
is
better
than
the
execution
i
love
coconut
and
this
beer
has
more
of
it
than
many
similar
beers
but
a
few
short
commings
a
nice
enough
brown
ale
though
one
duly
overshadowed
by
the
guest
coconut
fruitiness
but
as
a
firsttime
visitor
to
this
tropical
locale
that
seems
aok
to
me
though
i
would
be
limited
to
a
couple
as
the
balance
does
suffer
somewhat
overall
interesting
i
wonder
if
the
toasted
coconut
might
go
better
with
a
lager
though
taken
on
its
own
its
fine
enough
just
dont
expect
anything
too
special
and
its
a
decent
brown
ale
from
kona
brewing
if
youre
looking
for
a
brown
ale
thats
promising
an
extra
bit
of
flavor
compare
this
to
rogues
hazelnut
brown
ale
and
youll
see
why
im
kinda
disappointed
here
o
coconut
lovers
indulge
just
not
for
me
overall
i
loved
the
coconut
flavor
but
it
really
needs
more
to
back
it
up
just
about
what
i
expected
o
not
ba
but
i
dont
think
i
would
try
to
encourage
homebrewers
to
put
coconut
in
the
mix
it
is
definitly
worth
a
try
though
its
tasty
and
fun
but
im
unlikely
to
want
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
overall
blech
so
artificial
tasting
lots
of
syrups
and
extract
flavors
bad
flavorings
sticky
sweet
and
syrupy
no
hops
barely
drinkable
seems
like
something
a
macro
would
brew
claiming
to
be
micro
o
a
pretty
decent
beer
with
some
interesting
flavors
this
would
probably
go
great
with
some
roasted
meat
or
chocolate
desserts
the
alcohol
was
spoton
too
as
it
was
present
but
not
distracting
while
this
isnt
as
good
as
sam
smiths
or
newcastle
there
was
nothing
sticky
or
burnt
about
this
beer
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
one
in
the
dead
of
winter
or
on
a
nice
summer
night
and
i
plan
on
having
one
of
these
with
some
frozen
thin
mints
that
ive
had
in
storage
for
a
while
kona
has
a
subtly
nice
offering
here
thats
sure
to
please
nearly
everyone
a
light
brown
color
on
the
first
pour
into
a
steinlager
glass
the
smell
of
light
coconuts
off
the
glass
first
taste
is
a
distinct
coconut
flavor
with
a
brown
ale
backend
a
light
toasted
coconut
mouthfeel
settles
on
the
tongue
overall
a
good
interesting
beer
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
lighter
version
of
a
coconut
porter
from
maui
brewing
think
ill
have
another
kona
koko
brown
pour
is
dark
burgundy
with
tight
tan
head
nose
is
nice
caramel
malt
with
the
toasted
coconut
blended
in
well
some
vanilla
and
fudge
notes
toasted
marshmellow
behind
create
a
nice
balance
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
light
on
the
coconut
with
the
nice
fudge
and
vanilla
a
hint
watery
in
the
finish
but
well
blended
malts
and
sweetness
lighter
body
higher
carb
probably
is
what
detracts
from
the
finish
but
smooth
and
soft
on
the
palate
edit
seems
this
is
a
winter
release
so
i
assume
march
19th
was
a
best
by
date
still
not
a
bad
expired
beer
a
pretty
good
brew
here
to
have
a
few
the
only
problem
is
the
flavors
can
start
to
overwhelm
after
a
while
my
wife
likened
it
to
sun
tan
lotion
good
to
try
not
great
to
session
the
beer
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
chocolate
and
toffee
notes
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
big
american
brown
ale
the
flavor
is
more
complex
there
chocolate
and
toffee
are
still
present
but
the
toasted
coconuts
also
really
come
through
and
add
to
the
overall
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
nice
o
could
have
been
worse
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
for
sure
not
enough
chocolate
aroma
or
flavor
to
be
a
decent
brown
ale
with
or
without
coconut
prost
it
is
a
nice
beer
the
coconut
flavors
make
it
different
i
think
it
is
worth
checking
out
but
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
overall
i
like
coconut
and
this
one
is
a
nice
specialty
beer
i
understand
the
necessity
for
some
bitterness
here
but
to
me
it
needs
to
be
a
little
less
sharp
or
perhaps
a
different
type
of
hops
i
like
the
uniqueness
and
would
pick
up
another
six
pack
but
there
are
others
i
would
get
first
o
decent
but
not
something
id
want
to
drink
a
ton
of
i
think
without
the
coconut
this
beer
would
have
nothing
to
offer
tried
on
draft
at
kbc
at
the
honolulu
airport
a
very
nice
light
brown
pour
with
a
generous
2
finger
white
head
decent
spotting
and
lacing
throughout
smell
is
toasted
coconut
nuts
and
some
fruits
taste
follows
the
nose
but
thankfully
its
not
a
coconut
bomb
it
actually
accents
the
beer
nicely
and
im
not
a
huge
coconut
fan
definately
a
unique
spin
on
the
style
and
i
enjoyed
the
effort
this
has
been
my
favorite
offering
from
kona
fruits
and
nuts
blend
into
the
taste
well
pretty
complex
which
was
a
surprise
feel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
like
my
brown
with
a
bit
more
body
but
its
adequate
overall
a
good
effort
with
a
unique
spin
on
the
style
more
of
a
sessionable
brown
it
works
for
me
and
will
try
out
of
the
bottle
back
home
an
interesting
beer
and
expected
from
a
hawaiian
brewer
you
need
to
like
coconut
to
like
this
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
coconut
fan
but
the
beer
works
o
after
i
tasted
this
for
the
1st
time
i
must
say
that
it
wasnt
horrible
but
certainly
nothing
i
would
ever
purchase
again
not
at
all
a
good
session
brew
by
any
means
im
placing
the
other
five
beers
on
the
bottom
shelf
of
my
fridge
incase
im
out
of
beer
and
thats
all
there
is
the
only
other
option
is
to
pour
them
down
the
sink
and
feed
the
fish
do
this
beer
lacks
balance
i
like
coconut
but
not
like
this
its
not
horrible
but
theres
nothing
about
this
that
would
make
me
want
to
revisit
it
i
could
finish
it
if
i
wanted
to
but
i
dont
need
the
calories
so
down
the
drain
it
goes
mouthfeel
is
creamy
semi
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
end
with
a
thin
finish
o
this
is
an
excellent
easilydrinkable
springsummer
beer
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
brown
ale
and
very
easy
to
chug
through
a
few
of
these
o
coconut
surely
a
gimmick
right
wellactually
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
although
definitely
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
a
sixer
of
who
knew
coconut
and
beer
would
make
a
drinkable
combo
this
one
should
get
props
for
originality
as
the
coconut
makes
it
pretty
unique
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
with
a
great
aroma
and
flavor
while
the
body
is
a
little
weak
it
definitely
should
not
keep
anyone
from
trying
this
one
an
amiable
oddity
and
a
deal
at
3
39
for
the
22
oz
bottle
seems
to
be
a
wife
pleaser
so
who
am
i
to
judge
o
simple
but
pleasing
you
come
for
the
coconut
and
well
you
stay
for
the
coconut
there
isnt
too
much
else
going
on
the
base
beer
is
a
little
bland
an
easy
drink
for
a
breezy
summer
night
part
of
me
wants
to
test
this
out
as
a
mixer
but
i
think
it
would
be
easily
overwhelmed
o
overall
i
like
a
good
brown
ale
and
this
one
has
a
nice
little
twist
with
the
coconut
the
coconut
is
not
a
distraction
like
i
was
worried
about
it
is
very
well
placed
in
the
brew
definitely
let
this
one
warm
up
to
get
the
full
coconut
experience
b
i
actually
think
the
caramel
tastes
are
stronger
than
the
coconut
that
said
there
is
a
nice
mellow
coconut
after
taste
o
this
beer
would
be
great
without
the
coconut
flavoring
just
as
a
brown
ale
with
wonderfully
abundant
coconut
notes
in
the
nose
and
a
touch
of
coconut
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
taken
to
the
next
level
of
craft
beers
i
will
say
i
am
a
fan
of
all
of
kona
brewings
offerings
that
being
said
id
never
had
the
koko
brown
until
now
i
poured
it
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
small
off
whitetan
head
with
a
nice
dark
copper
color
first
sip
was
a
nice
carmel
and
coffee
note
with
slight
hops
on
the
finish
the
glass
laces
nicely
and
its
quite
refreshing
great
drinkable
beer
not
thick
or
heavy
but
a
good
drinkin
beer
this
wasnt
too
bad
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
lighter
for
the
palate
you
really
have
to
let
this
warm
up
a
bit
too
really
get
those
coconut
flavors
to
show
and
even
then
it
seemed
a
bit
overdone
at
times
but
i
was
glad
to
at
least
find
some
other
hop
and
malt
flavors
here
to
keep
this
mildly
interesting
its
certainly
very
drinkable
for
what
it
is
overall
not
so
much
good
but
interesting
the
finished
is
a
little
watery
but
this
one
has
a
lot
of
coconut
flavor
definitely
worth
giving
it
a
try
if
nothing
more
than
for
its
uniqueness
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
lackluster
with
better
aroma
and
mouthfeel
this
would
be
a
very
solid
coconut
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
toasted
malts
some
coconut
taste
is
coconut
up
front
some
toasted
malts
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
unique
beer
worth
checking
out
o
the
addition
of
coconuts
to
this
beer
definitely
makes
the
smell
and
taste
very
unique
it
is
also
rather
easy
to
drink
although
i
wouldnt
call
it
sessionable
given
the
sweetness
drink
up
othis
is
a
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
get
a
lot
of
this
and
always
enjoy
it
the
coconut
isnt
too
pronounced
but
it
is
noticeable
and
appreciated
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
out
there
overall
a
bit
cloying
and
singular
in
nature
though
a
small
glass
with
dessert
might
fit
the
bill
a
better
balance
aka
less
coconut
and
or
more
dark
malts
would
kick
this
up
a
notch
for
sure
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
clear
brown
color
with
a
nice
looking
off
white
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
some
really
nice
notes
of
coconut
and
vanilla
the
beer
smell
sweet
for
the
most
part
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
very
nice
in
my
opinion
i
like
the
smoothness
of
the
coconut
how
it
comes
into
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
creamy
side
and
yet
light
and
dry
overall
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
beer
i
actually
want
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
to
have
on
hand
for
a
little
very
good
stuff
in
my
opinion
here
overall
a
pleasantly
flavored
brew
although
a
bit
thin
o
while
only
slightly
sweet
and
actually
turning
a
bit
bitter
in
the
finish
this
beer
still
seems
best
suited
for
use
as
a
desert
beer
or
i
imagine
as
refreshment
on
a
hot
day
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
could
be
better
balanced
especially
visavis
its
signature
ingredient
coconut
i
also
tried
this
beer
paired
with
a
chocolate
dessert
in
that
environment
this
beer
shines
when
compared
to
sampling
it
alone
i
highly
recommend
having
this
beer
in
that
context
overall
i
like
it
but
it
also
doesnt
resemble
any
other
brown
ale
ive
had
i
can
see
how
typical
brown
ale
flavors
play
off
and
are
enhanced
by
the
coconut
i
think
the
brewers
could
cut
back
on
the
sweetness
though
one
of
the
few
brown
ales
i
actually
enjoyed
update
now
ive
had
one
out
of
the
bottle
and
its
not
the
same
its
still
pleasant
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
on
tap
the
flavors
were
so
much
fuller
and
richer
leaving
the
scoring
as
the
draught
scoring
o
enjoyed
this
one
and
after
looking
forward
to
koko
brown
in
ny
i
wasnt
disappointed
for
any
fans
of
coconut
it
is
a
must
try
and
really
worth
checking
out
just
for
the
nice
take
on
the
style
interesting
stuff
and
i
am
glad
to
have
gotten
a
chance
to
have
tried
it
while
on
vacation
in
the
west
coast
makes
me
wish
that
more
than
only
a
few
different
coconut
beers
existed
the
gimmick
seems
like
a
pretty
solid
idea
to
me
if
it
were
to
be
done
in
a
drier
manner
than
this
beer
presented
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
needs
some
body
an
interesting
beer
perhaps
a
bit
gimmicky
tough
to
have
more
than
one
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
at
all
but
at
the
taste
not
terribly
interesting
nuff
said
on
this
half
a
glass
and
i
was
finished
with
this
one
maybe
a
bad
bottle
o
i
love
coconut
and
the
smells
given
from
this
beer
satisfy
the
nose
but
i
had
to
work
to
find
it
in
the
flavors
this
would
make
a
nice
late
spring
early
summer
beer
a
bit
lighter
and
thinner
than
i
had
expected
maybe
its
because
i
warmed
up
with
a
few
magic
hat
9s
but
i
found
this
beer
surprisingly
good
good
spring
pick
and
id
definitely
buy
it
again
to
share
i
have
no
idea
why
i
bought
a
beer
called
koko
from
hawaii
and
didnt
think
that
it
might
have
coconut
in
it
i
cant
stand
coconut
this
beer
is
significantly
coconutty
the
base
beer
is
sugary
like
dimestore
chocolate
wafers
if
you
grew
up
on
those
wafers
which
came
in
diabetic
vanilla
radioactive
pink
and
kona
brewing
company
chocolate
flavors
you
can
take
a
trip
down
memory
lane
with
this
beer
i
couldnt
finish
half
the
bottle
myself
d
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
of
the
finish
and
aftertaste
arent
excellent
but
the
smell
is
fantastic
and
it
drinks
pretty
well
brown
in
color
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
the
coconut
certainly
comes
through
on
the
aroma
nice
and
nutty
as
well
theres
also
a
hint
of
vanilla
to
it
quite
sweet
with
plenty
of
toffee
and
caramel
too
lots
and
lots
of
coconut
flavor
with
the
toast
nuts
and
sweet
malt
taking
a
bit
of
a
back
seat
on
this
one
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
toastroast
malt
flavors
to
prevent
it
from
being
cloying
i
would
have
another
if
offered
taste
maybe
the
coconut
is
the
lactose
like
aspect
in
the
mouthfeel
a
pretty
smooth
beer
consistent
throughout
some
additional
sweetness
grows
out
of
the
lactoseishness
its
decent
but
at
the
same
time
conventional
like
most
brown
ales
aim
to
be
id
like
to
see
a
thicker
version
of
this
not
necessarily
higher
alcohol
but
bigger
more
coconut
vanilla
but
stick
with
the
brown
malt
d
not
bad
it
is
clearly
a
well
made
brown
ale
at
heart
the
coconut
definitely
has
an
effect
though
i
cant
decide
if
it
helps
or
hurts
in
the
end
what
a
great
beer
a
little
bit
of
aftertaste
but
it
goes
down
smoothed
this
is
mr
beach
beer
sitting
on
the
beach
drinking
this
would
be
heaven
i
use
to
drink
brown
ales
but
never
found
one
that
hitthe
spot
but
oh
baby
does
this
hit
the
spot
so
find
your
beach
and
drink
overall
i
was
pretty
impressed
i
didnt
expect
for
the
flavors
to
come
across
as
well
as
they
did
and
the
vanilla
was
definitely
a
nice
surprise
i
think
they
definitely
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
going
for
a
toasted
coconut
kind
of
thing
i
heart
coconut
so
this
brew
is
right
up
my
alley
goes
well
with
bbq
chicken
pizza
im
almost
ashamed
to
admit
it
but
this
beer
tastes
great
pours
an
innocous
looking
brown
ale
color
and
has
the
same
smell
as
a
basic
american
brown
ale
with
that
roasty
malty
sweetness
and
body
but
this
has
a
hint
of
fresh
coconut
in
the
nose
not
milky
and
sweet
and
artificial
but
islandic
and
raw
flavor
is
pronounced
coconut
up
front
like
drinking
the
water
from
one
in
a
tree
in
south
india
or
like
a
mounds
bar
touch
of
cocoa
in
there
too
this
feels
more
drinkable
than
it
should
its
not
deserty
at
all
and
is
lighter
than
it
looks
in
feel
overall
one
of
konas
best
beers
that
i
have
had
very
unique
and
very
memorable
definitely
buy
this
if
you
like
coconuts
d
pretty
unique
brown
here
flavor
is
distinctively
coconut
filled
as
well
as
loads
of
vanilla
notes
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
could
drink
however
one
is
just
fine
with
me
o
although
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
it
had
the
typical
brown
ale
taste
and
smell
but
the
sweet
coconut
flavor
mixed
in
well
and
was
not
too
over
powering
would
definitely
drink
again
appearance
is
brown
with
12
finger
of
white
head
itsnose
most
certainly
contains
coconut
along
with
malts
and
sugar
koko
brown
tastes
of
nuts
a
good
amount
of
coconut
and
more
malts
it
is
a
flavor
that
is
not
too
overpowering
in
any
aspect
and
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
crisp
finish
a
good
beer
which
is
worth
picking
up
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
brown
ale
medium
effervescence
a
touch
of
dryness
in
the
quite
watery
finish
a
solid
if
only
middle
of
the
pack
brown
theyve
done
better
but
could
do
far
worse
overall
indeed
it
is
a
brown
ale
flavored
with
coconut
if
any
part
of
that
statement
gives
you
pause
then
this
isnt
for
you
a
fun
beer
if
you
dont
like
coconut
dont
try
it
mo
the
mouthfeel
is
not
too
heavy
more
of
a
medium
light
body
the
sweetness
in
it
is
light
making
it
drinkable
and
easygoing
not
a
terribly
complex
beer
the
coconut
is
so
predominant
that
it
makes
this
just
a
simple
beer
that
you
can
easily
drink
without
much
thought
overall
this
is
a
great
spring
beer
it
just
might
be
my
favorite
kona
offering
this
and
pipeline
are
neck
and
neck
why
kona
doesnt
offer
both
these
beers
yearround
is
beyond
me
because
they
are
by
far
konas
best
two
beers
the
flavor
profile
is
equally
subtle
its
a
soft
brown
ale
dominated
by
roasted
nearly
burnt
malts
with
just
a
small
influence
of
coconut
and
nut
flavors
i
let
the
brew
come
closer
to
room
temperature
to
see
if
i
get
a
little
more
but
im
unfortunately
disappointed
actually
as
the
koko
brown
comes
up
to
temperature
its
becoming
somewhat
less
drinkable
sorry
but
im
not
excited
about
this
one
overall
ehhh
not
a
fan
tastes
like
a
bland
brown
ale
with
lots
of
non
beer
flavors
added
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
drinkability
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
definitely
has
a
lot
of
coconut
this
is
a
tasty
hit
of
a
beer
and
one
i
am
sure
to
buy
again
its
taste
is
its
best
trait
and
it
is
very
balanced
and
good
i
was
expecting
a
mediocre
brown
like
so
many
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
light
sweet
coconut
flavors
and
the
perfect
use
of
hops
in
this
beer
go
try
it
overall
not
bad
i
cannot
see
sessioning
this
probably
2
would
be
my
limit
but
for
a
gimmick
brew
they
did
this
right
no
real
overkill
interesting
burps
o
not
a
bad
little
flavored
brown
ale
reviewed

not
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
which
is
a
good
thing
in
this
case
because
the
coconut
along
with
the
malts
gives
off
plenty
of
sweet
impressions
id
say
the
coconut
is
just
as
apparent
in
this
as
the
maui
coconut
porter
i
think
i
actually
like
this
one
more
not
to
mention
it
is
a
dollar
cheaper
and
you
get
50
more
very
easy
to
drink
nice
and
smooth
i
wouldnt
mind
a
silkier
richer
mouthfeel
but
other
than
that
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
foresee
a
few
more
sixpack
purchases
in
my
future
o
i
think
it
is
worth
trying
if
you
have
never
had
a
coconut
beer
but
this
type
of
beer
is
not
my
style
o
overall
an
easy
drinker
and
people
who
like
coconut
most
likely
would
enjoy
it
id
say
its
worth
trying
but
not
seeking
out
cheers
o
interesting
aroma
and
acceptable
flavor
the
mouthfeel
should
be
heavier
though
to
match
the
toasted
sweet
coconut
and
smoke
on
the
other
hand
this
is
a
brewery
in
hawaii
i
doubt
a
heavy
beer
would
go
well
there
typical
mouthfeel
about
like
a
newcastle
o
i
like
its
its
not
great
but
i
like
it
id
recommend
it
nothing
to
really
flip
over
but
its
tasty
and
well
done
prost
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
beer
and
was
a
little
to
shallow
for
my
taste
it
is
very
drinkable
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
pours
a
fairly
clear
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
aroma
is
sweet
malts
grains
and
coconut
the
taste
is
a
nice
mix
of
coconut
and
sweet
malts
the
malts
really
start
to
take
over
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
and
the
drinkabilty
is
good
overall
a
solid
brown
ale
with
just
a
bit
of
a
twist
overall
a
wonderful
beer
for
someone
who
loves
coconut
quite
an
interesting
take
on
a
brown
ale
aloha
koko
brown
o
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
love
all
things
coconut
i
think
its
a
fairly
average
brown
but
the
coconut
is
my
cup
of
tea
if
you
are
not
a
coconut
fan
its
not
for
you
i
will
take
it
anyday

tasty
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
nuts
and
some
coconut
aromas
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
nuts
slight
vanilla
and
toasted
coconut
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
with
a
crisp
carbonation
level
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
that
the
coconut
works
with
but
i
have
had
better
coconut
beers
before
this
was
my
last
beer
on
my
vacation
i
was
sad
to
be
heading
back
to
missouri
my
wife
and
i
had
these
at
the
kona
grill
in
the
honolulu
airport
overall
interesting
with
lots
of
coconut
but
its
too
onedimensional
and
way
too
sweet
doverall
i
was
quite
pleased
with
this
it
felt
thin
at
times
but
over
all
i
thought
all
the
flavors
came
out
nicely
and
was
balanced
well
not
the
greatest
brown
ale
but
pretty
tasty
i
could
see
myself
getting
it
again
if
i
sw
it
around
town
lighter
and
easy
to
drink
coconut
in
beer
where
else
would
we
expect
this
but
from
a
hawaiian
brewer
subtle
extreme
beer
as
well
quickforming
head
drops
down
almost
as
quickly
to
a
thin
lacing
brown
and
clear
a
bit
of
coconut
and
dark
chocolate
a
bit
of
a
candy
bar
nose
here
body
stands
a
little
thin
and
coconut
flavor
is
quite
prevalent
maltiness
does
not
really
come
forwarda
quick
smattering
of
toasted
and
very
faint
roasted
malt
balancing
hoppiness
does
just
that
coconut
flavor
fades
quick
and
a
drink
of
toasted
graininess
is
all
thats
left
not
much
to
this
brown
ale
other
than
the
element
of
coconut
which
perhaps
saves
this
beer
from
being
entirely
pedestrian
the
difference
between
this
and
maui
coconut
porter
is
that
the
latter
integrates
the
beer
part
well
with
the
coconut
with
the
former
the
coconut
dominates
if
youre
looking
a
sweet
brown
ale
then
this
is
your
beach
if
you
hate
coconut
then
you
better
think
twice
ive
boughten
this
one
a
few
times
and
usually
enjoy
it
ive
given
it
to
some
friends
who
typically
all
enjoyed
it
except
for
those
who
did
not
like
coconut
it
is
very
sweet
and
crisp
with
the
coconut
i
do
not
recomend
drinking
a
whole
bunch
of
these
but
the
first
one
is
great
but
the
sweetness
can
become
too
much
after
drinking
more
then
a
couple
great
for
a
celebration
something
new
and
sweet
final
notes
a
rather
interesting
experiment
by
kona
but
it
paid
off
this
brown
ale
is
both
interesting
and
unique
and
tastes
great
the
coconut
adds
a
little
something
special
i
think
and
would
serve
to
make
it
a
great
semisweet
beer
to
pair
with
some
dessert
i
dig
it
i
can
see
how
anyone
not
a
fan
of
sweet
would
find
this
immediately
cloying
and
too
much
to
handle
i
think
that
while
the
novel
ingredient
is
quite
artificial
it
works
for
this
style
if
you
are
into
the
novel
ingredient
or
sweeter
beers
this
is
well
worth
seeking
out
t
overallan
ok
beer
would
get
it
again
but
no
need
to
seek
it
out
if
you
cant
get
it
poured
into
a
pint
glass
malty
brown
beer
small
head
dies
down
to
nothing
aroma
of
vanilla
caramel
and
just
sweet
overall
had
a
pleasing
taste
of
nutty
malts
and
a
rich
sweet
coconut
milk
flavor
that
was
very
strong
suggestions
of
brown
sugar
and
toasted
coconut
almost
cloying
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
overall
a
well
brewed
beer
a
great
looking
chestnut
brown
with
a
beige
foamy
head
the
scent
of
toasted
coconut
really
comes
through
and
there
is
a
slight
boozyness
in
the
background
there
is
alot
of
cocnut
here
maybe
more
than
i
would
like
its
a
bit
sweet
but
there
is
enough
other
stuff
going
on
to
keep
you
interested
it
has
a
light
body
and
retained
a
fair
amount
of
chunky
lacing
this
is
a
good
picnic
beer
or
a
beer
for
those
that
dont
like
beer
an
interesting
brew
and
one
that
should
be
tried
especially
for
desert
with
maybe
some
fried
bananas
and
vanilla
ice
cream
o
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
since
samuel
adams
noble
pils
this
has
become
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
reminds
me
a
bit
of
quilters
irish
death
if
you
see
this
one
definitely
give
it
a
try
ok
got
duped
by
the
bottle
guys
tricked
me
into
buying
a
sixer
beacuse
from
what
i
thought
i
was
getting
a
nice
brown
ale
with
a
hint
of
coconut
wafting
in
from
the
hawaii
shores
not
so
much
way
to
much
coconut
on
this
completely
overpowers
the
beer
but
then
again
that
is
good
because
as
the
coconut
fades
the
cardboardy
beer
comes
through
i
was
hoping
for
something
else
oh
well
this
will
get
a
ton
of
sales
from
soccermoms
in
the
midwest
that
just
got
back
from
a
family
hawaiian
trip
however
so
they
get
the
last
laugh
give
it
a
try
you
will
enjoy
i
had
a
seven
ounce
pour
of
this
as
a
part
of
a
sampler
at
pour
24
in
las
vegas
new
york
new
york
hotel
overall
this
beer
was
way
too
coconuty
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
and
i
couldnt
get
past
it
to
the
beer
the
color
was
nice
and
as
a
brown
should
be
but
everything
else
was
coconut
im
not
a
big
fan
of
any
fruit
flavor
in
my
beer
so
i
had
trouble
reviewing
it
for
anything
else
pours
a
clear
browncopper
with
a
large
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
coconut
oilsuntan
lotion
and
ocean
my
first
few
whiffs
took
me
to
the
beach
in
hawaii
the
taste
is
all
toasted
coconut
a
lovely
little
coconut
beer
as
a
diversion
not
sure
id
want
more
than
one
or
two
huge
dirty
brown
head
explodes
out
of
the
glass
pretty
dark
beer
here
beautiful
dark
amberorange
color
great
head
retention
and
nice
lacing
being
left
already
strong
smells
like
somoan
cookies
cookielike
malt
bill
creamy
and
sweet
coconut
some
coffe
a
seriously
sweet
smelling
beer
almost
a
bit
too
much
on
the
sugary
side
still
nice
combo
with
the
brown
ale
and
coconut
taste
is
less
sweet
mercifully
basically
its
a
worthy
brown
ale
with
a
slab
of
coconut
on
it
unique
tastes
definite
hops
note
in
there
lots
of
mellow
toasted
maltiness
some
hazelnut
flavors
in
there
too
brown
ale
can
be
a
really
underutilized
style
of
beer
hats
off
to
kona
for
stepping
up
and
doing
something
a
little
different
flavors
do
seem
to
fade
rather
quickly
leaving
a
watery
kind
of
finish
with
a
nuttymetal
lingering
feel
is
pretty
soso
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
to
this
beer
than
what
it
has
a
more
robust
body
would
make
this
beer
really
stand
out
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
i
really
like
the
flavors
in
this
beer
especially
the
coconut
hint
good
beer
overall
all
in
all
im
kind
of
surprised
by
this
one
im
a
big
coconut
fan
and
i
like
the
taste
of
coconut
juicewater
a
lot
which
this
brew
reminds
me
of
the
toasted
notes
are
significant
in
that
it
doesnt
just
taste
like
mediocre
coconut
flavoring
that
being
said
the
underlying
brown
ale
is
relatively
flacid
and
lackluster
although
when
on
sale
for
6
a
six
pack
i
could
see
myself
picking
this
one
up
again
d
yum
different
but
i
could
session
it
overall
surprising
and
extremely
unique
definitely
worth
trying
maybe
only
worth
trying
again
if
you
really
like
a
sweet
nutty
beer
o
i
think
kona
really
achieved
what
they
were
going
for
with
this
one
the
coconut
flavor
and
aroma
are
both
quite
bold
but
dont
completely
overpower
the
beer
tasty
stuff
picked
this
one
up
for
my
wife
a
month
or
so
ago
at
merchant
of
vino
in
tamarac
square
in
denver
got
tired
of
waiting
for
her
to
drink
it
so
i
opened
it
up
tonight
poured
a
medium
to
dark
brown
with
a
nice
little
white
head
aromas
of
toasted
coconut
nuts
and
milk
chocolate
almost
like
an
alomond
joy
at
times
medium
bodied
with
more
almond
joylike
flavors
milk
chocolate
and
shredded
coconut
surprisingly
pretty
good
an
interesting
beer
especially
when
compared
to
the
maui
brewing
companys
coconut
porter
first
with
appearance
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
here
brown
little
darker
in
color
creamy
but
thinner
head
not
the
greatest
retention
but
thats
no
deal
breaker
to
me
has
a
very
strong
coconut
and
vanilla
cream
smell
to
it
i
know
this
sounds
weird
but
the
smell
is
almost
like
a
flavored
coffee
creamer
i
have
mixed
thoughts
on
the
taste
i
preferred
it
better
cooler
than
warm
when
it
was
cooler
it
had
more
of
a
malty
brown
ale
taste
with
some
subtle
coconut
the
warmer
it
got
it
quickly
became
a
very
sweet
coconut
creamy
mess
i
thought
it
was
a
little
too
much
warmer
mouthfeel
i
found
to
be
a
little
watery
even
for
a
brown
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
not
terrible
glad
i
tried
it
but
dont
know
if
id
necessarily
seek
this
out
again
overall
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
enjoyed
the
novelty
its
not
a
big
beer
like
mauis
coconut
porter
but
i
dont
think
its
really
trying
to
be
its
a
decent
enough
session
beer
and
if
you
like
toasted
coconut
im
willing
to
bet
you
crack
another
one
open
as
that
coconut
finish
lingers
well
after
your
last
sip
but
its
not
stellar
overall
all
together
try
it
you
might
like
it
but
if
you
want
a
brown
ale
look
elsewhere
surprisingly
crispy
taste
for
a
brown
ale
coconut
is
apparent
along
with
malty
goodness
a
very
refreshing
beer
nothing
spectacular
pleasant
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
not
terrible
d
not
bad
the
flavor
is
exotic
but
it
feels
less
substantive
than
i
would
want
id
have
again
if
offered
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
thankfully
i
bought
this
beer
as
a
single
certainly
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
it
lacks
the
complexity
id
like
to
see
from
the
style
coconut
adds
a
decent
touch
something
makes
me
think
itd
taste
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
were
i
relaxing
on
a
beach
in
maui
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
dry
actually
and
i
like
dont
like
sweet
beers
drinkability
is
pretty
high
but
overall
preference
for
this
beer
is
low
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
but
i
still
look
forward
to
pipeline
season
again
verdict
worth
the
price
and
thats
to
say
its
cheap
overall
i
really
was
surprised
by
this
one
i
originally
bought
this
six
pack
to
have
one
and
send
the
rest
out
as
extras
i
might
end
up
sending
one
maybe
two
out
the
rest
is
for
me
and
my
tasting
friend
joss
one
of
the
sweeter
brown
ales
ive
had
but
its
not
a
massive
bashyouoverthehead
sweetness
which
makes
it
more
drinkable
than
some
not
a
standard
brown
ale
but
it
will
do
especially
when
being
sold
for
2
per
pint
pours
a
very
translucent
brown
with
thin
head
nose
is
light
with
some
brown
sugary
baked
goods
palate
offers
the
expected
toasted
coconut
thin
watery
body
and
some
brown
sugar
notes
too
easily
drinkable
with
the
watery
aspect
could
use
more
body
for
sure
toasted
coconut
flavors
are
nice
though
overall
a
new
twist
on
a
brown
ale
for
me
and
very
hawaii
i
did
like
it
and
would
not
turn
down
another
drink
i
liked
it
was
different
but
not
over
done
had
good
character
and
was
pretty
balanced
probably
wont
have
again
unless
i
am
in
kona
drinkability
great
interesting
taste
but
a
little
too
strange
and
adulterated
to
be
a
session
beer
seems
like
it
would
be
a
good
mood
beer
or
for
an
esoteric
food
pairing
where
the
food
is
chosen
first
and
the
beer
has
to
fit
the
palate
presents
more
of
the
same
toasted
malt
coconut
and
brown
sugar
in
equal
portions
its
fairly
thin
simplistic
and
sweet
theres
some
slightly
astringent
graininess
in
the
finish
along
with
more
brown
sugar
sweetness
a
clean
and
fairly
drinkable
beer
but
not
particularly
good

the

overall
a

funny
thing
with
the
toasted

this
reminded
me
of
lees
macaroon
bars
back
in
scotland
as
a
kid
d
good
beer
surprised
by
this
offering
from
kona
glad
they
took
an
apparently
unique
approach
to
an
up
and
coming
category
coconut
of
beer
i
like
it
d
probably
wont
try
this
one
again
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
i
dont
really
like
fruity
beers
but
since
this
one
is
a
nice
brown
ale
ill
let
it
slide
appearance
has
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
off
white
minimal
head
and
lace
smell
has
a
dominant
sweet
roasted
coconut
aroma
with
some
grain
in
the
back
taste
again
of
sweet
roasted
coconut
grain
with
a
good
hop
balance
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
my
first
brown
ale
with
coconut
is
very
enjoyable
drinkability
is
lacking
a
little
this
is
a
very
solid
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
im
not
sure
that
im
reaching
for
another
one
in
the
same
sitting
maybe
if
i
had
a
fireplace
by
my
side
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
works
well
in
summer
months
as
i
drink
this
in
march
i
will
note
that
i
need
to
try
this
in
the
summer
as
it
definetely
will
fill
the
void
of
a
dark
ale
that
holds
up
well
to
drink
in
summer
heat
i
reccommend
this
beer
it
is
a
drinkable
brown
ale
but
the
coconut
does
nothing
for
the
brew
its
drinkable
but
there
are
much
better
brown
ales
available
im
a
big
coconut
fan
so
this
brew
was
high
on
my
totry
list
it
was
tasty
and
easydrinking
with
a
nice
coconut
character
that
wasnt
too
sweet
but
overall
the
experience
was
a
little
onedimensional
mauis
coconut
porter
will
remain
my
goto
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
light
amount
of
carbonation
d
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
its
a
unique
twist
on
the
typical
brown
ale
with
the
addition
of
the
coconut
if
youre
looking
for
a
typical
brown
look
elsewhere
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
new
and
unique
give
this
a
shot
id
definitely
buy
this
again
koko
brown
is
an
excellent
nut
brown
ale
with
a
creamy
coconut
finish
i
have
had
it
both
on
tap
and
out
of
the
bottle
and
it
is
much
better
on
draft
for
how
sweet
the
finish
is
i
found
it
to
be
a
rather
sessionable
beer
like
the
new
addition
to
the
aloha
series
d
an
interesting
beer
i
think
the
coconut
works
well
here
im
dropping
the
drinkability
down
a
bit
because
its
so
unique
not
really
something
id
want
more
than
one
of
at
once
but
its
well
worth
a
try
unless
youre
angelica
pickles
as
someone
who
will
eat
an
entire
coconut
raw
in
minutes
milk
included
perhaps
i
set
the
standard
too
high
from
what
i
remember
though
pipeline
porter
doesnt
bash
you
over
the
head
with
aggrandized
coffee
flavor
which
is
entirely
the
problem
here
ease
off
on
the
sweetness
let
the
malts
take
center
stage
and
retune
the
coconut
and
wed
have
a
desirable
brown
ale
as
of
now
its
a
no
go
sorry
this
is
ok

d
apart
from
the
undercarbonation
noted
above
i
love
the
coconut
taste
as
i
do
in
most
coconut
beers
and
coconut
in
general
wouldnt
be
too
hard
to
sling
back
a
6er
crystal
maple
toffee
head
roasted
slightly
doughy
effervescent
hoppy
brown
for
sure
but
nice
medium
to
medium
full
body
with
medium
carbonation
a
nice
example
of
the
style
overall
not
just
specific
to
american
browns
i
would
argue
that
despite
being
a
west
coast
brew
it
really
borders
on
the
english
style
if
you
swapped
out
the
nuttiness
for
sweet
sugar
but
no
real
hop
presence
i
could
detect
overall
a
good
combination
of
rough
coffee
and
smooth
chocolate
with
some
sharp
molasses
and
brown
sugar
the
only
thing
holding
this
brew
back
for
me
by
far
is
the
price
of
au13
a
bottle
a
bit
steep
the
flavor
is
rich
and
interesting
it
mixes
the
tastes
of
caramel
coffee
and
nuts
in
a
very
smooth
drink
with
a
wonderful
aftertaste
the
alcohol
content
is
also
pleasantly
high
cant
recommend
this
one
at
all
overall
very
solid
brown
ale
very
tasty
nicely
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
id
be
very
happy
to
have
this
beer
again
poured
this
brew
from
a
22oz
bomber
its
a
dark
ale
with
a
quickly
dissipating
tan
head
in
the
light
this
shit
is
a
beautiful
dark
red
really
amazing
color
excited
carbonation
pretty
nice
aroma
too
quite
sweet
and
malty
molasses
the
hops
are
definitely
coming
through
as
well
its
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
some
alcohol
but
its
hard
to
really
describe
the
flavor
because
its
kinda
nondescript
but
pleasant
when
this
first
hit
my
palate
it
came
across
as
quite
bitter
but
i
adjusted
to
it
after
two
or
three
sips
and
it
becomes
quite
drinkable
im
a
hop
head
this
isnt
a
hoppy
beer
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
its
a
great
brown
ale
t
the
taste
is
not
like
the
smell
in
a
good
way
though
the
taste
is
unsweetened
chocolate
and
burnt
molasses
the
hops
presence
is
not
overwhelming
it
is
full
bodied
and
creamy
overall
i
like
this
while
i
was
into
the
belgians
for
a
while
i
really
think
my
favorite
style
is
a
nut
brown
or
just
brown
as
classified
ale
this
is
really
standard
for
a
brown
ale
but
is
still
darned
good
which
makes
it
so
good
little
bit
o
brown
sugar
some
nuts
maybe
but
just
a
really
tasty
drinking
brew
overall
very
nice
some
of
the
malts
and
brownsugarmolasess
could
be
more
pronounced
from
one
another
also
not
sure
how
fresh
this
is
not
sure
id
get
it
again
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
poured
to
a
very
dark
brown
with
little
head
smell
was
a
mild
malt
with
a
not
a
lot
of
hops
showing
once
again
it
was
the
malt
that
generated
the
flavor
hops
were
not
a
major
player
mouthfeel
was
ok
thru
the
finish
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
would
not
buy
again
prost
lampertland
overall
this
one
seems
under
flavored
and
watery
but
i
guess
its
fine
for
the
style
low
abv
but
still
barely
tastes
like
alcohol
is
even
in
this
one
drinkable
and
better
than
most
in
the
genre
d
nicely
done
this
isnt
an
india
brown
ale
by
any
means
but
it
is
a
bit
hoppier
and
better
balanced
than
most
sweeter
brown
ales
nothing
over
the
top
going
on
here
but
it
is
flavorful
and
quite
drinkable
o
its
put
together
well
and
no
real
flaws
but
nothing
exciting
either
on
cask
at
rattle
n
hum
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
over
an
inch
of
frothy
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
boozey
with
some
brown
sugar
and
caramel
tastes
malty
with
a
nice
alcohol
presence
which
is
surprising
since
the
abv
isnt
all
that
high
some
sweet
brown
sugar
creamy
mouthfeel
works
well
on
cask
overall
nothing
special
but
a
good
brown
ale
c
ive
already
firmly
established
that
bear
republic
handle
hops
well
but
how
will
they
fair
on
a
maltier
style
very
well
actually
tribute
ale
pours
brown
yeah
a
brown
pour
for
this
brown
ale
the
aroma
is
rather
straightforward
offering
a
slightly
nutty
robust
maltiness
the
taste
follows
but
with
some
hops
not
as
susceptible
on
the
nose
offer
a
deep
earthy
resiny
character
that
compliments
the
malts
very
well
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
gently
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
great
overall
bear
republic
do
a
great
fairly
traditional
brown
ale
if
there
was
ever
a
beer
brewed
to
my
passing
away
if
it
a
quarter
of
the
worth
of
this
amazing
ale
i
will
rest
easy
poured
from
a
650ml
bomber
bottle
poured
a
light
brown
with
red
tints
lots
of
enticing
chocolate
caramel
toffee
and
vanilla
notes
on
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
round
and
balanced
the
palate
offers
flavours
of
strong
dark
fruit
coffee
toasted
marshmallow
with
a
good
bitter
backing
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
brown
ale
really
glad
i
got
to
try
it
some
nice
nuts
in
the
smell
and
chocolate
in
the
taste
with
caramel
throughout
and
easy
to
drink
would
definitely
order
it
again
overall
one
of
the
better
browns
ive
had
recommended
o
a
very
solid
brown
ale
it
has
great
flavor
and
nice
complexity
pretty
happy
i
picked
this
one
up
and
it
was
priced
very
well
for
a
bomber
atmosphere
is
really
good
appearance
characterized
by
dark
body
nice
carbonation
and
a
frothy
top
lots
of
sticky
lacing
nose
is
simple
but
well
done
flavor
is
pungent
and
woody
with
a
medium
hop
and
some
sweet
and
bitter
components
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
an
okay
brown
ale
is
missing
some
of
the
complexity
of
the
world
class
brown
ales
but
still
a
good
drinker
o
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
brown
ale
malty
sweet
and
pretty
straightforward
would
drink
again
overall
this
was
a
pretty
successful
tribute
ale
nothing
too
revolutionary
and
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
my
tastes
as
a
brown
ale
as
i
lean
more
toward
the
english
style
but
i
would
revisit
again
considering
the
decent
price
point
o
overall
a
polished
brown
with
a
big
flavor
that
was
silky
smooth
and
easy
to
down
flavor
flowed
nicely
together
enjoyable
drinkability
and
worthy
a
try
pours
nice
dark
brown
color
good
quality
head
and
decent
lacing
when
poured
in
a
glass
smell
has
brown
sugar
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
great
with
strong
malt
and
nutty
notes
coming
through
overall
a
quality
beer
that
would
probably
be
even
better
in
season
fall
to
winter
o
an
easy
drinking
beer
as
is
typical
for
style
but
richer
and
slightly
darker
in
flavor
than
average
easily
recommended
although
perhaps
a
little
closer
to
an
average
brown
ale
than
i
expected
from
this
outstanding
brewer
do
not
serve
very
cold

i
could

quite
a

of
these
given
the
price

this
should
be
on
everyones
must
try
list
o
was
not
expecting
the
hop

pass
o
decent
drinkable
beer
but
not
something
id
recommend
or
regularly
purchase
if
you
get
it
try
to
find
it
on
tap
do
a
really
great
american
brown
this
a
tasty
beer
it
has
good
flavor
its
drinkable
its
balanced
its
a
great
concept
beer
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
offer
tribute
i
will
inevitably
be
getting
another
bomber
unfortunately
the
taste
is
part
american
brown
part
oxidisedsweet
tasting
dark
malts
also
quite
watery
and
a
leaves
a
bit
of
a
coca
cola
twang
on
in

mouth
drinkable
not
quite
what
im
looking
for
from
an
american
brown
ale
but
definitely
drinkable
by
the
end
of
the
bomber
i
think
itll
have
grown
on
me
a
bit
average
us
brown
ale
which
dips
its
lid
to
the
english
plenty
of
nut
which
works
the
booze
or
alcohol
heat
doesnt
help
but
still
a
decent
brown
ale
that
is
pb
the
sweeter

use

medium

nothing
that
really
sticks
out
for
me
a
bit
to
earthy
i
love
my
american
brown
ales
so
hopefully
this
lives
up
to
it
and
it

many
hoppy

tonight
i
finally
got
a
solid

forward
beer
with
great
nutty

and
a
slight

good
stuff
overall
simply
put
one
hell

a
worthy

served
a

o
i
liked
this
but
couldnt
have
it
all
the
time
i
think
bear
republic
really
knew
what
they
were
doing
here
however
i
think
i
prefer
a
straight
ahead
brown
ale
different
strokes
i
guess
overall
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
tried
cooks
well
with
red
beans
and
rice
and
tastes
great
on
the
side
ill
definitely
be
trying
more
of
this
one
just
right
for
fall
o
very
well
done
brown
ale
but
not
my
favorite
decent
flavors
but
kind
of
light
definitely
worth
a
try
and
comes
highly
recommended

color
with
a
wonderful

very
nice

it
the
aroma

a

lots

across
the
tongue
with
the
very
first
sip
and
so
it
begins
as
the
smooth

start
to
come
together
and
mixed
with
a
light
earthy
bitter
hoppines
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation

darker
than
most
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style

there

am
getting
the

on

tongue
after
each
sip
there
is
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
crisp
and
slightly
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
but
nothing
too
special
on
this
one
o
good
brown
ale
not
over
the
top
but
definitely
crafty
brew
might
need
a
little
more
alcohol
kick
or
bitter
hops
to
bring
it
to
an
imperialdouble
status
but
a
great
drinker
for
a
brown
ale
fan
personally
i
would
like
it
a
little
more
sweeter
on
the
brown
sugar
side
of
things
overall
the
beer
has
a
fantastic
balance
and
although
it
is
sweet
is
highly
drinkable
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
that
ive
ever
had
and
id
buy
it
again
for
sure
worth
seeking
out
o
soliddecent
and
good
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easily
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
and
would
consider
it
to
be
sessionable
the
flavor
mirrors
the
smelllots
of
cocoa
there
is
a
light
hop
presence
in
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
is
short
but
resembles
a
semisweet
chocolate
the
body
is
rich
and
the
carbonation
is
low
this
is
a
good
chocolatey
brown
ale
mildly
sweet
but
quickly
turns
dry
behind
the
roasty
malts
and
piney
hops
body
is
a
bit
too
thin
slightly
high
on
the
carbonation
front
good
drinkability
and
an
excellent
value
at
5bomber
a
straight
forward
simple
american
brown
good
flavour
and
nicely
balanced
overall
drinkability
more
expensive
than
iced

prost
o
this
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
recently
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
a
perfect
representation
of
the
style
only
the
second
bear

beer
ive
ever
had
i
think
and
both
have
been
very
good
this
is
a
must
find
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
stuff
o
bear

have
come
up
with
a
very
nice
brown
ale

with
a
roasted
malt
taste
that
is
not
too
sweet
then
a
slight
sourness
followed
by
warm
alcohal
and
molasses
flavours
this
fades
to
a
nice
roasted
semi
dry
finish
that
lingers
maybe
too
rich
for
more
than
a
couple
bombers
but
at
over
6
thats
about
right
delicious
if
this
is
your
tribute
pete
its
aa
good
one
i
wish
i
could
find
this
beer
again
i
will
be
finishing
the
bomber
by
myself
with
no
problems
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
roasted
malts
with
the
hops
peeking
through
briefly
late
with
a
citrus
and
pine
finish
to
me
this
is
a
dry
malt
backbone
rather
than
sweet
or
the
hops
could
be
balancing
more
than
i
thought
texture
is
a
bit
thin
although
the
balance
is
nice
i
feel
it
maybe
simplifies
things
a
bit
this
is
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
not
really
memorable
a
delicious
brown
ale
dominated
by
roasted
malt
character
bready
flavor
characteristics
and
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
a
lovely
beverage
this
is
interesting
its
a
decent
brown
ale
and
i
bet
its
great
on
tap
but
the
kiwi
fruit
tang
has
me
worried
and
throws
this
brew
offkilter
despite
the
similarity
in
nose
i
would
choose
bells
best
brown
over
this
overall
its
drinkable
but
its
missing
somethingmaybe
its
depth
or
maybe
its
fullness
of
palate
overall
its
good
but
i
was
hoping
for
great
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
solid
nice
to
see
a
delicious
brown
ale
very
good
beer
not
sure
when
it
comes
out
think
its
seasonal
as
i
only
see
it
every
now
and
then
get
it
verdict
pretty
decent
beer
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
but
well
done
and
good
value
pours
a
black
with
an
off
white
head
the
head
is
frothy
and
lasting
laces
well
on
the
glass
the
aromas
are
faint
but
i
get
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
molasses
has
a
good
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
flavor
is
nice
with
a
good
mix
of
sweet
malts
and
lightly
hopped
has
a
watery
texture
and
a
medium
body
a
good
hearty
finish
with
a
good
aftertaste
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
beer
very
good
and
full
of
flavor
d
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
in
a
long
time
its
very
drinkable
and
i
really
like
the
fact
that
its
not
over
carbonated
this
is
a
beer
i
could
kick
back
and
have
a
few
of
for
sure
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
go
check
it
out
cheers
wow
what
a
sessionable
brown
ale
all
the
flavors
i
expect
are
there
but
not
so
much
to
make
me
sick
of
it
the
perfect
hybrid
of
a
drinkable
pub
beer
and
a
sippernight
cap
at
home
beer
as
a
person
who
doesnt
normally
like
brown
ales
or
hoppy
beers
i
can
say
that
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
despite
my
biases
im
glad
i
bought
this
beer
and
i
doubt
they
will
but
i
hope
they
keep
making
it
color
is
a
very
pretty
brown
quite
fizzy
head
that
dissapates
quickly
aroma
is
breadymalty
with
a
nice
hoppy
back
end
flavor
is
ok
not
great
again
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
drinkability
is
also
a
little
questionable
as
i
felt
the
alcohol
very
quickly
and
almost
couldnt
finish
the
beer
d
a
good
sweet
brown
by
bear
republic
give
it
a
try
pours
dark
brown
with
a
tall
tan
head
the
smell
is
wet
tree
bark
molasses
sweet
curry
spice
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
vinuous
tang
moving
into
coppery
elements
some
meaty
notes
a
little
citrus
twinge
and
finally
a
clenching
tannic
finish
its
quite
thick
though
not
syrupy
moderately
carbonated
and
fills
and
coats
the
mouth
quite
well
easy
to
drink
not
a
sipper
but
given
this
abv
not
a
gulper
either
closer
to
a
yorkshire
brown
than
most
other
american
browns
ive
had
very
nice
d
highly
drinkable
makes
me
wish
i
had
more
then
one
this
is
a
brown
thats
made
to
last
and
one
that
you
wont
get
tired
of
drinking
halfway
through
two
finger
light
brown
head
mediumslow
dissipation
with
good
lacing
clear
dark
brown
body
lots
of
visible
carbonation
rising
to
top
of
glass
nose
is
pretty
complex
nutty
some
roast
with
chocolate
up
front
and
grassy
hops
on
the
back
end
taste
is
fairly
chocolaty
with
other
malt
aspects
pushed
into
background
though
the
brown
sugar
and
molasses
notes
became
more
prominent
as
the
beer
warmed
mediumfull
mouthfeel
noticeable
but
not
aggressive
effervescence
drinkability
is
good
nice
autumn
quaffer
abv
not
noticeable
one
of
the
better
abas
ive
had
da
very
serviceable
american
brown
ale
but
not
excellence
achieved
by
many
of
bear
republics
other
beers
a
dark
tan
head
dense
with
fine
bubbles
tops
out
huge
over
the
dark
reddishbrown
brew
the
bubbles
pop
slowly
to
and
fro
making
for
a
nice
little
wait
before
the
froth
fades
leaving
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
behind
smells
sublimely
sweet
and
slightly
nutty
tastes
of
sweet
malts
mixed
with
bitter
dark
chocolates
the
big
carbonation
gives
it
an
airy
but
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
which
makes
for
some
very
smooth
drinking
great
balance
and
great
taste
make
for
a
great
brown
here
probably
not
for
a
couple
of
months
one
of
the
best
american
brown
ales
ive
had
bear
republic
delivers
again
with
one
of
their
lesser
known
beers
fairly
drinkable
and
certainly
a
better
example
of
the
style
than
other
ones
that
ive
had
good
drinkability
especially
for
fans
of
malty
beers
a
solid
brown
ale
thats
worth
trying
and
im
not
huge
in
the
brown
ale
world
yet
i
find
most
brown
ales
on
the
boring
side
but
this
one
was
one
of
the
better
browns
that
ive
had
and
well
above
average
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
solid
american
brown
a
style
that
is
way
underrepresented
especially
on
the
west
coast
cheers
to
pete
d
one
of
the
best
malty
brown
ales
around
avoids
the
sourness
of
some
and
brings
dense
flavor
of
the
sweet
and
delicious
kind
the
full
flavor
is
reflected
in
the
mouthfeel
its
fullbodied
but
seriously
extremely
smooth
to
drink
creamy
sweet
savory
and
just
extreme
mellow
qualities
in
this
beer
have
combined
for
a
great
brown
ale
if
youre
the
new
castle
is
too
sweet
for
me
type
then
give
this
one
a
shot
you
wont
regret
it
done
of
the
better
browns
that
i
have
tried
lately
but
in
fairness
not
a
style
that
i
buy
much
kudos
to
bear
for
not
killing
this
with
hops
but
i
havent
met
a
bear
republic
beer
that
wasnt
top
notch
buy
again
sure
pete
brown
tribute
ale
was
a
good
not
a
great
beer
not
that
there
are
that
many
great
brown
ales
it
was
quite
drinkable
and
i
liked
it
but
it
was
not
memorable
far
from
the
malty
brew
i
was
expecting
but
well
crafted
in
its
own
right
good
balance
and
drinkability
i
do
believe
that
i
could
put
away
a
few
of
these
but
this
is
indeed
darker
on
the
brown
spectrum
the
carbonation
is
just
right
it
seems
and
serves
the
style
drinkability
very
complex
and
tasty
id
love
to
try
this
beer
again
bear
republic
tribute
ale
is
a
very
clear
very
lively
deep
crimson
brown
berr
with
a
huge
lumpy
beige
head
wowza
it
has
a
green
hoppy
aroma
like
grass
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
with
a
slightly
gritty
finish
its
pretty
bitter
and
green
tasting
it
tastes
like
a
home
brew
there
is
a
slight
note
of
chocolate
but
no
sweetness
is
detected
this
is
almost
like
an
india
brown
ale
two
fingers
of
camel
tan
colored
loose
foam
which
possesses
enough
larger
bubbles
to
speed
up
the
dissolve
slight
dimpling
a
decent
amount
of
stickiness
creates
more
lacing
than
usually
found
in
the
category
reddish
brown
color
opaque
with
more
clarity
at
the
rims
as
well
as
an
orange
cast
the
nose
much
more
demure
than
expected
caramel
milk
chocolate
black
raisins
and
cherries
brazil
nuts
indistinct
roast
to
it
same
could
be
said
for
the
mixed
citrus
nuances
little
here
bespeaks
a
strong
hops
presence
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
churns
and
fluffs
things
up
malt
carob
milk
chocolate
powder
caramel
and
molasses
all
there
but
truthfully
its
not
overly
sweet
lower
levels
of
raisin
black
grape
cherry
apricot
fruit
and
the
orange
to
lemon
citrus
drops
off
a
notch
as
well
maybe
its
an
after
effect
of
the
carbonation
but
you
get
a
suggestion
of
mineral
water
the
nuttiness
holds
off
but
shows
nicely
through
the
finish
not
bad
at
all
but
no
aces
hidden
up
its
sleeves
d
very
nice
to
drink
very
palatable
this
one
gets
an
overall
noms
from
me
notes
a
fitting
tribute
to
pete
brown
denjoyable
and
goes
nice
with
smoky
flavors
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
consider
having
it
again
but
im
not
sure
id
count
it
among
my
favorites
brew
pours
to
a
nice
brown
color
with
some
ruby
like
highlights
the
head
is
big
light
tan
with
pretty
good
retention
and
what
is
there
has
left
great
amount
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
whole
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
caramel
maybe
molasses
and
chocolate
nutty
aroma
comes
through
as
well
hop
presence
is
minimal
at
least
compared
to
the
malt
profile
big
and
malty
lots
of
caramel
and
chocolate
come
through
roasted
malt
flavor
is
negligible
hops
come
out
more
here
at
the
tail
end
plays
well
with
the
carbonation
as
it
gives
a
slight
tingle
to
the
tongue
and
adds
a
slight
bite
has
a
nice
feel
as
it
washes
across
the
mouth
creamy
like
feel
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
and
what
i
think
is
a
great
brown
ale
one
of
my
favorite
styles
ill
look
for
this
one
again
not
sure
why
it
took
so
long
for
me
to
pick
it
up
a
really
enjoyable
and
good
brown
ale
nothing
special
just
nicely
done
d
its
quite
nice
but
halfway
through
the
pint
it
got
a
bit
boring
its
solid
quite
flavorful
but
i
wasnt
clamoring
for
a
second
dits
got
a
nice
sweet
malt
taste
some
aspects
of
balance
that
are
pretty
well
done
straight
forward
and
to
the
point
mouthfeel
was
too
thin
for
me
and
it
seemed
to
have
a
little
too
much
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
more
than
adequate
brown
ale
but
definitely
not
the
star
of
the
category
split
a
1
pt
6
oz
bottle
with
my
wife
who
didnt
like
it
and
ended
up
giving
me
her
half
the
beer
was
too
full
it
pours
dark
with
just
a
tint
of
red
coloring
nice
little
head
with
lacing
that
lasts
throughout
looks
good
theres
a
lot
there
in
the
smell
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
its
got
the
earthy
smell
of
a
brown
and
im
catching
a
hint
of
something
sweet
maybe
thats
the
brown
sugar
talked
about
on
the
bottle
this
has
a
smoky
front
end
on
the
taste
its
almost
like
a
porter
theres
a
nice
sweet
aftertaste
that
lingers
this
beer
doesnt
have
much
punch
when
it
hits
your
mouth
which
was
a
disappointment
the
drinkability
on
this
is
pretty
high
all
things
considered
ive
found
this
style
to
be
pretty
drinkable
in
the
past
and
then
have
it
sneak
up
on
me
be
careful
with
this
one
high
drinkability
not
real
high
abv
its
smooth
and
pretty
drinkable
poured
dark
brown
with
a
very
small
light
brown
head
nice
thin
sheets
of
lace
are
offered
the
foam
is
frothy
and
creamy
light
brown
sugar
and
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
along
with
a
milky
creamy
sweet
character
light
molasses
brown
sugary
crusted
sweet
bread
milky
chocolate
mild
vanilla
notes
and
cocoa
nibs
in
the
finish
nice
bubbly
and
wet
mouthfeel
even
thought
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
nothing
amazing
just
a
good
brown
ale
definitely
worth
a
try
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
those
looking
to
try
something
different
and
to
my
buddies
that
are
brown
fans
i
would
highly
recommend
they
at
least
try
it
excellent
autumn
brown
looks
just
like
a
coca
cola
in
pour
with
a
tighter
head
very
little
lace
nose
is
toasty
lot
of
molasses
and
a
gentle
smoke
and
yeasty
bread
palate
of
toffee
and
mollasses
smokey
mild
sour
chestnut
and
clove
quality
pumpkin
pie
malt
and
mild
bitter
finish
pumpernickel
a
tad
leathery
great
for
thanksgiving
season
fantastic
brown
ale
with
chocolate
and
roast
on
top
of
a
solid
malt
backbone
restrained
hops
provide
a
soft
bitterness
without
much
flavor
or
aroma
alcahol
on
the
mid
6s
makes
for
a
firm
beer
but
still
very
drinkable
loved
this
with
grilled
steak
reminded
me
of
a
bigger
moose
drool
highly
deliciously
drinkable
nicely
balanced
while
showcasing
maltiness
that
doesnt
become
too
sweet
or
overroasted
a
great
rendition
of
an
american
brown
another
winner
from
this
great
brewery
high
on
alcohol
for
a
brown
but
it
is
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
solid
mahogany
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
froth
nice
lacing
on
the
nose
are
aromas
of
caramel
chocolate
brown
sugar
toffee
subtle
raisins
roasted
nuts
a
touch
of
smoke
and
roasted
malts
tastes
a
little
sweet
with
great
carbonation
and
all
of
the
characteristics
from
the
nose
overall
a
solid
beer
that
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
huge
fan
of
bear
republic
and
this
is
probably
their
weakest
beer
in
their
lineup
definetly
not
a
bad
beer
but
lacking
compared
to
their
other
efforts
worth
a
shot
especially
if
you
are
a
brown
ale
fan
just
dont
expect
the
best
of
the
best
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
clear
burgundy
color
and
formed
a
huge
light
tan
foamy
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
slowly
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
the
flavor
was
of
malt
coffee
anise
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
body
was
medium
light
and
the
finish
was
slightly
sweet
a
very
nice
brown
ale
drinkability
very
easily
one
the
the
best
porterstouts
that
ive
tasted
goes
down
very
smooth
notes
bdbs
d
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
nice
flavor
profile
and
easy
to
drink
this
brewery
has
done
it
again
excellent
beer
worth
seeking
out
sweet
nutty
and
chocolate
flavors
with
a
well
balanced
and
steady
carbonation
a
light
hop
bitterness
on
the
close
with
a
long
subtle
finish
with
a
hint
of
peppery
spice
the
beer
does
tire
a
bit
as
the
carbonation
lessens
so
refresh
the
pour
regularly

a
deep
chestnut

hops
are
present
but
not
overbearing
allowing
the

to
keep
its

balance
seems
good
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
with
moderate
carbonation
finishes
mainly
sweet
but
somewhat
bitter
more
roasty
than
anything
there
is
also
an
odd
nutty
character
in
the
finish
overall
not
a
bad
brown
ale
and
fits
the
style
well
this
is
what
american
brown

are
supposed
to
be

is
sweet
without
being
cloying
toasted
malt
is
noted
as
well
the
body
is
a
little
thin
but
combined
with
nice
carbonation
gives
a
nice
soft
texture
nice
easy
drinking
brown
a
change
of
pace
from
high
hopped
beers
but
still
does
it
without
being
overlysweet
mouthfeel
seemed
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
maybe
even
somewhat
watery
but
was
also
very
smooth
not
too
heavy
and
no
real
alcohol
presence
make
this
very
drinkable
not
sure
why
but
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
from
this
one
maybe
because
ive
always
thought
of
bear
republic
only
for
their
hoppy
beers
but
they
continue
to
impress
with
this
one
bottle

ruby

with
a

head
no

cocoa
powder
aroma
with
some
bread

and
a

hop
note
flavor
is
dark
and
bready
with
pumpernickel
wheat
bread
crust
and
an
even
roasted
note
than
leads
into
a
moderate
bitterness
semi
dry
finish
and
smooth
overall
pretty
good
brown
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
keep
em
comin
as
for
drinkability
i
will
say
there
is
not
that
much
not
offensive
but
also
not
inviting
i
will
not
willingly
be
back
to
try
this
one
again
d
easy
drinking
a
very
solid
and
respectable
brown
ale
more
sweetness
was
expected
on
the
palette
and
would
have
been
appreciated
final
thoughts
substantial
and
pleasing
in
all
designs
and
methods
but
really
doesnt
transcend
the
brown
ale
style
still
one
of
the
best
sweet
brown
ales
you
can
get
d
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
browns
but
i
figured
id
give
this
one
a
try
given
that
its
a
bear
republic
this
is
a
solidly
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
a
22oz
bomber
bottle
purchased
at
the
beer
stop
for
4
50
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
and
appears
a
clear
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
creamy
tan
lingering
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
floral
hops
hazelnuts
bittersweet
chocolate
mocha
brown
sugar
mildly
roasted
coffee
caramel
a
lot
going
on
here
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
with
ample
carbonation
glad
to
have
easy
access
to
this
check
it
out
if
you
can
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
is
a
richtasting
beer
that
is
not
too
filling
english
browns
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
very
difficult
to
find
with
any
kind
of
freshness
on
our
side
of
the
pond
but
this
is
a
good
one
that
i
will
be
seeking
out
again
if
possible
d
very
drinkable
great
stuff
here
d
very
easy
to
drink
excellent
for
a
stronger
session
beer
this
poured
a
very
dark
brown
but
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
looked
more
like
a
very
deep
red
i
expected
this
beer
to
be
much
heavier
than
it
was
based
on
that
appearance
but
found
it
to
be
much
more
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
the
wife
and
i
both
enjoyed
this
one
d
ok
not
my
favorite
brown
but
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
if
someone
else
bought
them
the
aroma
is
incredible
on
this
beer
but
unfortunately
it
is
far
and
away
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
boost
the
crystal
malt
to
give
it
some
body
and
sweetness
to
round
things
out
the
flavours
are
great
but
i
feel
like
i
have
to
strain
myself
to
taste
anything
another
solid
brew
from
a
great
brewery
i
have
never
been
disappointed
with
any
of
their
brews
pours
a
reddish
brown
colored
body
with
a
foamy
offwhite
colored
head
has
a
nuttiness
to
the
smell
and
coffee
aroma
a
very
watery
palate
has
a
nice
coffee
taste
there
is
some
nuttiness
here
too
a
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
enjoy
dark
reddened
brown
color
small
creamy
offwhite
head
leaves
some
thin
sheets
on
the
glass
rich
malty
aroma
immediately
brings
to
mind
the
soft
smell
of
a
fresh
vanilla
bean
sweet
chocolate
cookie
dough
flowers
and
some
fruity
yeast
tasty
mochalike
flavor
with
brown
sugar
and
hops
creamy
and
nutty
the
hops
begin
to
stand
out
a
bit
more
as
it
warms
smooth
and
medium
bodied
very
good
brown
ale
maybe
more
of
an
americanenglish
hybrid
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
that
glows
reddish
at
the
edges
under
a
lamp
light
with
a
big
frumpy
tan
head
with
excellent
retention
smells
of
sweet
toffee
and
dark
fruits
taste
is
very
rich
and
satisfying
molasses
sweetness
with
a
good
amount
of
toasty
malts
backed
by
earthy
hops
a
long
bittersweet
toffeish
finish
medium
to
fullbodied
iminently
drinkable
not
the
most
complex
english
brown
on
the
market
but
very
delicious
the
nose
really
got
my
expectations
up
but
the
taste
was
just
ok
still
good
good
drinkability
opinion
well
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
am
definitely
going
to
finish
my
glass
so
it
doesnt
suck
by
any
means
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
balance
i
like
sweet
beers
bock
is
my
favorite
style
but
this
beer
doesnt
really
play
well
on
my
palate
it
has
some
flavor
in
the
beginning
with
the
fresh
hops
and
sugary
sweetness
but
then
fades
to
mouthfeel
pretty
quickly
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
beer
out
again
if
i
want
an
american
brown
ale
i
will
stick
with
others
md
light
bodied
and
a
little
thin
on
the
feel
a
very
good
beer
though
and
easily
drinkable
md
nice
mouthfeel
smooth
full
bodied
decent
drinkability
a
little
lackluster
at
times
but
its
good
this
beer
poured
an
attractive
reddishbrown
color
with
a
generous
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
the
aroma
was
of
chocolate
caramel
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
was
a
combination
of
all
of
these
with
a
coffee
flavor
that
also
came
through
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
proper
carbonation
drinkability
was
high
i
liked
this
and
will
have
again
pete
has
a
big
foamy
lasting
head
on
top
of
a
clear
deep
dark
russet
body
aroma
is
full
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
along
with
an
earthy
smell
flavor
is
mostly
sweet
chocolate
but
overall
very
light
finishes
slightly
bitter
with
an
aftertaste
of
sour
cherries
and
iron
alcohol
is
noticable
but
not
overpowering
ok
but
not
anything
i
would
buy
again
the
drink
is
mediumbodied
and
nicely
carbonated
with
superb
quaffability
an
excellent
brown
ale
from
a
brewer
that
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
d
could
go
for
2
or
3
pints
3

dvery
solid
beergood
smell
and
taste
i
would
purchase
this
again
and
again
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
it
would
make
a
good
dessert
beer
worth
trying
sometime
a
good
drinker
recommended
clear
dark
amber
with
a
medium
tan
head
nutty
toasted
malt
aroma
blended
with
caramel
and
cream
more
hoppy
than
expected
for
a
brown
ale
lots
of
caramel
cocoa
with
some
licorice
and
brown
sugar
its
good
but
i
wanted
more
from
these
guys
especially
for
a
tribute
ale
dark
leather
brown
color
hues
of
orange
glow
at
the
bottom
of
my
mug
smells
like
a
brown
pie
crust
a
bit
of
pine
of
tropical
notes
mild
hop
aroma
toast
taste
more
pie
crust
and
toast
flavors
a
pinch
of
toffee
solid
presence
of
juicy
fruity
hops
with
a
burnt
astringent
flavor
in
the
back
a
hoppy
brown
ale
i
like
thats
usually
not
for
me
but
this
did
the
trick
d
easy
enough
to
drink
reminds
me
of
a
porter
odrinkable
despite
residual
sugar
more
like
a
stout
in
flavor
to
me
but
not
out
of
style
for
me
the
b
r
yeast
profile
dominates
and
overwhelms
all
their
beers
i
enjoy
them
less
because
of
it
i
cant
describe
what
it
is
but
it
is
unmistakable
that
being
said
i
still
drink
alot
of
their
beer
so
it
cant
be
bad
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
and
medium
drinkability
due
to
the
hopalcoholroast
bite
pretty
clear
brown
pour
whitish
head
aromas
of
some
roast
malt
nut
piney
hops
tastes
roast
malts
with
light
molassestofee
something
a
bit
metallic
maybe
more
hops
than
i
would
prefer
in
a
brown
ale
lively
mouthfeel
very
clean
finishing
overall
pretty
good
another
good
brew
from
bear
republic
id
like
to
compare
this
back
to
back
with
lost
coasts
downtown
brown
and
see
which
i
like
better
bear
republic
did
a
nice
job
with
this
english
brown
every
sip
was
better
than
the
last
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
can
remember
tasting
definitely
give
this
one
a
shot
if
you
see
it
laying
around
the
taste
also
has
caramelly
whole
wheat
nuts
light
sweetness
and
balancing
bitterness
its
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
tasty
and
drinkable
a
solid
beer
yet
not
really
exciting
or
overly
interesting
this
poured
an
opaque
mahogany
with
a
bit
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
alcohol
and
roasted
barley
with
wild
wheat
and
sweet
lemon
hops
it
tasted
like
burnt
barley
and
sweet
molasses
malt
with
rusty
copper
hops
and
a
bit
of
coffee
and
licorice
it
was
fairly
thick
with
moderate
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
licorice
aftertaste
overall
this
was
almost
like
an
imperial
porter
it
had
a
very
interesting
flavor
that
was
clean
and
drinkable
it
was
fairly
enjoyable
but
it
was
missing
something
special
to
really
captivate
me
d
good
for
a
mile
but
flavor
could
improve
with
less
hops
and
earthiness
solid
dark
brown
chestnut
hue
that
revealed
hazy
yeasty
suspended
particles
under
sunlight
this
was
also
the
last
pour
of
the
bottle
gentle
but
persistent
small
bubble
carbonation
produced
a
steady
thin
tan
head
that
coated
the
surface
throughout
the
tasting
decent
lacing
and
it
sure
looked
promising
the
smell
was
an
understated
sweet
molasses
ginger
cookies
a
faint
hint
of
cinammon
the
first
impression
on
tasting
was
of
a
very
nicely
balanced
malt
with
a
hint
of
mincemeat
pie
filling
muted
tartness
but
not
fruity
the
texture
was
silky
and
smooth
with
a
lingering
bitter
finish
there
was
a
nice
balance
here
with
flavour
that
didnt
overpower
gently
sweet
but
nicely
balanced
malt
and
bitterness
it
came
across
as
very
drinkable
although
a
little
gassy
and
it
really
hid
the
alcohol
well
overall
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
thanks
to
biegaman
for
sharing
d
this
is
a
nice
brown

an
a

kinda
brown
ale
d
smooth
and
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
standard
pint
calm
easy
pour
produces
a
onefinger
creamy
brownwhite
head
atop
a
dark
reddish
brown
body
the
aroma
yields
dark
chocolate
mainly
with
some
caramel
and
earthy
grassy
hops
the
taste
brings
out
some
pf
those
hop
characters
in
the
finish
along
with
roasted
malts
this
definitely
could
use
more
body
but
it
is
a
smooth
drinker
nice
offering
from
bear
republic
brown
ales
are
definitely
an
underrated
style
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
balance
seems
ok
but
overall
i
find
this
one
indistinct
and
a
bit
tasteless
based
on
that
cant
say
ill
seek
it
out
again
pours
a
ruby
brown
color
with
a
nice
soapy
tan
head
that
left
a
sheet
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma

some
light

is
of
a

the
feel
has

with
tingely
carbonation
smooth

a

chewy
finishes
with
a
roasty
bitterness
a
very
nice
example
of
a
brown
ale
not
as
hoppy
as
some
american
versions
but
has
the
smooth
malty
presence
that
i
expect
d
definitely
easy
to
drink
especially
for
the
alcohol
percentage
would
be
a
good
session
beer
not
much
into
american
brown
ale
much
but
this
is
bear
republic
so
why
not
poured
a
decent
head
with
some
pacthy
lacing
the
smell
of
brown
sugar
and
wet
bark
was
nice
the
taste
had
alot
going
on
some
mocha
and
brown
sugar
with
a
dark
woodsy
funk
that
balanced
out
the
sweet
malt
driven
beer
just
a
hint
of
hops
also
came
on
at
the
finish
to
give
this
brew
some
kick
pours
brown
in
color
with
a
nice
half
inch
of
head
smell
is
fairly
hoppy
for
a
brown
no
problems
with
that
fairly
big
on
the
mouthfeel
as
well
plenty
of
the
brown
malts
and
sugars
to
make
this
good
but
then
hits
you
with
some
more
hops
easy
drinking
and
very
tasty
good
beer
d
this
is
one
that
i
wish
that
i
had
a
lot
more
of
but
sometimes
you
have
to
settle
for
a
taste
if
you
need
to
move
on
for
the
night
drinkability
is
a
for
sure
one
of
those
beers
that
can
just
as
easily
sipped
as
gulped
by
the
pint
i
definitely
savored
this
22
ounce
offering
more
so
than
when
i
drank
the
growler
around
a
camp
fire
earlier
in
the
summer
i
like
the
fact
that
a
brown
ale
from
bear
republic
adds
some
diversity
to
their
lineup
i
love
all
of
the
racer
brews
hop
rod
red
rocket
and
xpa
but
their
styles
all
border
each
other
for
me
the
black
bear
and
this
brew
hold
their
own
and
are
unique
in
their
styles
silky
and
very
drinkable
brown
ale
nice
roast
chocolate
aroma
some
nice
flavours
too
but
in
truth
doesnt
wow
me
abv
is
hidden
nicely
drinkable
and
respectable
but
nothing
that
special
where
are
you
gonna
run
905
greg
packer
unknown
d
this
was
a
lot
better
on
tap
fine
for
the
style
but
as
with
so
many
brown
ales
flavor
and
body
are
lacking
my
pour
resulted
in
a
fingers
worth
of
thick
mochatan
head
with
good
retention
the
nose
was
very
chocolaty
like
cocoa
powder
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
very
little
light
penetration
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
creamy
with
a
definite
chocolate
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
had
a
smokiness
to
accompany
the
chocoalte
this
was
a
darned
good
brown
and
that
is
high
praise
from
one
who
usually
disdains
the
style
after
a
small
sample
it
would
have
been
easy
to
pass
this
beer
up
for
something
more
exotically
flavored
but
i
decided
to
stick
with
it
for
the
full
pint
im
glad
i
did
the
beer
remained
simple
and
pure
but
grew
on
me
more
and
more
after
each
sip
delicately
balanced
between
chocolate
barley
malt
nutiness
and
with
a
touch
of
lactose
soft
coffee
sumatra
lingered
in
the
back
notes
and
gave
some
complexity
but
never
commanding
attention
the
beer
is
agressively
hopped
and
take
on
the
grassiness
and
herbal
notes
of
english
hops
medium
bodied
lightly
carbonated
and
as
easy
to
drink
as
chocolate
milk
mild
alcohols
never
become
an
issue
the
look
of
the
beer
certainly
fits
the
bill
with
its
solid
dark
brown
hue
light
haze
and
froathy
head
formation
retention
would
buy
again
but
not
a
super
deal
at
4
88
a
bomber
its
initially
rather
sweet
but
the
crisp
mitigation
is
timely
and
well
crafted
lending
a
pleasing
balance
that
works
along
with
a
mellow
abv
to
derive
a
drinkable
nature
too
many
tribute
beers
leave
you
wondering
why
the
honoree
didnt
deserve
a
better
beer
as
an
honor
this
one
makes
it
clear
that
mr
brown
must
have
been
a
worthy
recipient
of
the
kudos
implied
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
from
someone
and
sadly
i
cant
remember
who
since
it
has
been
a
while
pours
a
beautiful
brown
with
a
solid
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
darker
than
most
browns
smells
rich
roasty
and
creamy
taste
is
similar
but
with
a
coppery
finish
as
well
as
some
cocoa
notes
quite
rich
and
roasty
mouthfeel
is
fairly
robust
and
quite
creamy
delicious
and
deeply
flavored
whgich
keeps
you
interested
but
also
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
d
have
to
say
this
is
a
super
easy
beer
to
drink
listed
on
the
tap
as
7
it
was
a
bit
bigger
than
i
expected
it
to
be
but
the
smoothness
and
the
taste
allowed
me
to
get
this
one
down
really
fast
if
i
didnt
have
a
30
min
drive
home
i
woulda
had
a
2nd
half
liter
easily
a
tasty
brown
ale
appearance
dark

good
clarity

off

sweet
crystal
malts
taste
real
mix
here
first
off
fizzy
metallic
mouthfeel
which
i
wasnt
expecting
that
thins
out
quickly
some
chocolate
flavours
and
hops
on
the
finish
medium
roast
coffee
and
molasses
as
well
flavours
blend
together
better
after
half
a
glass
not
a
bad
brown
ale
d
this
isnt
as
heavy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
initially
so
i
could
probably
drink
the
entire
pint
i
split
it
with
a
friend
though
so
i
only
got
half
but
i
still
enjoyed
and
would
drink
another
another
good
bear
republic
beer
seems
to
be
something
of
a
trend
dark
brown
color
with
lots
of
nice
ruby
highlights
on
the
edges
smells
sweet
theres
some
coffee
notes
in
there
too
nice
malty
taste
some
sweet
molasses
and
some
burnt
coffee
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
is
damn
tasty
creamy
mediumbodied
this
is
a
solid
beer
bear
republic
is
just
amazing
oelergud
d
good
alone
or
with
a
hearty
meal
drinkability
is
good
solid
and
interesting
malt
presence
good
balance
quite
enjoyable
overall
a
nice
rounded
smooth
beer
it
was
thin
and
gave
a
slight
hoppiness
that
didnt
last
long
in
the
mouth
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
though
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
i
found
this
quite
an
enjoyable
brew
poured
on
tap
at
the
hop
devil
grill
in
the
east
village
of
manhattan
at
the
moment
they
have
at
least
6
beers
on
tap
from
bear
republic
although
this
was
the
only
one
i
tried
i
do
love
a
good
brown
ale
and
i
found
this
one
to
be
among
the
best
ever
i
used
to
love
sierra
nevadas
offering
but
i
think
this
one
does
it
one
better
due
to
its
mouth
feel
and
overall
balance
i
like
that
it
has
extra
body
something
lacking
in
other
brown
ales
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
definitely
recommended
pretty
easy
to
quaff
with
the
mouthfeel
but
the
diverse
profile
wants
me
to
slow
a
bit
its
nice
to
just
enjoy
the
malty
qualities
of
a
good
brown
ale
by
sipping
and
swirling
i
cant
think
of
a
brown
ale
ive
tried
that
beats
this
one
nice
job
bear
republic
peter
brown
would
surely
have
been
proud
of
the
work
youve
done
in
his
honor
drinkability
is
good
a
bit
high
on
abv
for
a
session
beer
but
tastes
like
a
good
session
beer
22
oz
bottle
poured
into
2
pint
glasses
clear
mahogany
color
with
2
fingers
of
light
tan
colored
head
that
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
aroma
is
nutty
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
bread
taste
is
somewhat
subdued
again
nutty
and
malty
somewhat
chewy
a
bit
lacking
in
the
hops
but
i
guess
that
comes
with
the
style
ive
really
been
digging
the
west
coast
hop
bombs
every
since
my
trip
to
portland
or
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
somewhat
reduces
drinkability
on
this
one
i
think
sometimes
the
nuttiness
of
the
browns
are
a
turnoff
and
this
avoids
that
sure
its
plenty
of
chewy
malt
in
the
backbone
but
it
has
a
sweetness
that
is
welcome
pours
an
almost
opaque
deep
brown
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
brown
malts
cocoa
and
subtle
caramel
the
taste
is
a
mild
blend
of
cocoa
brown
malts
and
some
slight
nut
flavor
the
beer
is
light
and
smooth
with
hidden
alcohol
while
not
nearly
as
impressive
as
the
other
brews
ive
had
from
bear
republic
this
one
is
still
enjoyable
an
all
around
good
brew
that
is
up
to
the
caliber
of
bear
republic
this
is
on
the
heavier
side
of
a
brown
ale
but
still
very
good
and
worth
getting
a
bomber
drinkability
isnt
really
there
for
me
its
to
heavy
and
sweet
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
too
much
sugarmolassas
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
as
up
front
drinks
alright
but
the
dryness
does
slow
me
down
i
expected
a
little
more
from
this
one
from
bear
republic
this
one
may
be
on
the
heavy
end
of
a
brown
ale
but
it
is
definitely
a
great
beer
light
poter
heavy
brown
ale
whatever
its
a
highly
drinkable
beer
thats
hard
to
put
down
recommended
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
perhaps
a
bit
strong
to
be
sessionable
it
remonds
me
more
of
a
porter
or
stout
than
a
brown
ale
not
the
easy
drinking
brown
some
might
expect
but
it
smells
and
tastes
good
and
is
certainly
drinkable
enough
dark
brown
pour
with
a
lightish
tan
head
that
didnt
last
smell
is
of
slight
roasty
malt
a
bit
nutty
perhaps
and
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
taste
is
rather
ordinary
light
roast
malt
typical
of
browns
with
a
just
a
hint
of
brown
sugary
bitter
sweetness
too
still
flavor
is
on
the
light
and
mellow
side
mouthfeel
is
moderate
not
too
thin
but
not
substantial
either
alcohol
is
barely
perceptable
if
at
all
very
drinkable
but
not
too
incredibly
unique
or
interesting
worth
a
try
if
you
like
browns
i
suppose
this
beer
has
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
it
is
a
little
small
but
it
is
there
the
body
is
mahogany
with
some
ruby
highlights
a
good
roasted
malt
smell
along
with
some
molasses
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
kind
of
subdued
compared
to
the
smell
there
is
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
then
some
bready
malt
with
hint
of
grassy
hops
it
ends
surprisingly
dry
maybe
not
that
surprising
since
there
is
very
active
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
dry
finish
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
and
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
d
at
this
point
im
probably
just
rating
the
drinkability
of
these
brown
ales
lower
than
they
deserved
because
im
not
very
enthusiastic
about
the
style
regardless
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
recently
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
just
not
remarkable
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
very
drinkable
not
terribly
complex
but
well
balanced
would
be
downright
sessionable
if
it
dropped
a
point
or
two
of
abv
not
hoppy
enough
by
far
to
show
off
as
an
example
of
the
american
brown
style
but
definitely
a
bit
nontraditional
as
an
english
brown
it
took
gold
at
gabf
in
the
brown
porter
category
its
definitely
worth
a
taste
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brown
ale
but
it
was
definitely
bordering
on
a
porter
me
thinks
it
reminded
me
of
deschutes
black
butte
porter
except
a
tinsy
bit
more
rich
and
nutty
the
color
was
dark
brown
and
the
head
was
vanilla
and
rather
full
the
taste
definitely
highlighted
some
caramel
with
the
nuttiness
in
the
background
and
hops
were
subtle
the
aroma
was
a
one
dimensional
sensations
of
caramelly
malt
but
the
taste
branched
out
a
bit
i
didnt
notice
that
the
abv
was
over
6
and
it
definitely
drank
like
it
was
lower
i
would
easily
go
back
for
this
if
i
could
get
it
on
tap
d
very
drinkable
easily
sessionable
a
nice
straightforward
brown
although
not
a
lot
of
complexity
and
not
all
that
interesting
as
i
keep
drinking
it
i
notch
up
the
taste
from
3
5
to
4
0
its
a
good
transition
beer
between
an
ipa
and
a
belgian
d
a
nice
suprise
as
i
really
dont
expect
much
out
of
this
category
ive
had
a
lot
of
mediocre
ones
but
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
alesmith
as
the
best
in
california
i
love
bear
republic
for
many
reasons
every
offering
ive
had
has
been
solid
hit
the
marks
and
shown
some
imagination
prices
are
reasonable
im
not
a
huge
brown
fan
but
this
is
one
id
seek
out
when
the
mood
strikes
d
a
tasty
brown
full
of
flavor
potent
but
not
a
beer
to
take
lightly
since
is
is
not
a
session
brown
but
certainly
fits
the
american
brown
category
well
one
of
the
most
drinkable
american
brown
ales
that
ive
ever
had
bear
republic
cant
miss
i
guess
pours
out
like
a
dark
maple
syrup
with
a
thin
head
of
bubbles
of
various
sizes
leave
some
spotty
lace
the
first
thing
noted
in
the
nose
is
the
earthy
and
woody
as
in
the
forest
not
the
material
hops
with
a
backing
of
honey
and
brown
sugar
their
estery
house
yeast
character
is
pretty
subdued
in
this
one
but
allows
for
some
fruitiness
to
pair
up
with
the
other
smells
these
esters
however
come
out
a
bit
more
in
the
flavor
along
with
some
dusty
cocoa
and
a
backing
of
the
hops
malt
flavor
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
hops
do
what
they
can
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
light
chalky
and
dusty
decent
brown
all
around
i
wasnt
expecting
or
hoping
for
some
hop
bomb
but
i
expected
a
little
more
from
this
brewery
id
call
this
one
a
crowd
pleaser
with
its
smooth
molasses
and
chocolate
flavor
really
smooth
is
the
word
to
describe
the
overall
experience
here
the
beer
has
a
mixture
of
sweet
dark
sugar
tastes
that
melt
into
the
cocoa
flavor
without
being
overly
sweet
from
malt
or
overbalanced
by
hops
a
little
heavy
for
the
style
but
a
great
all
around
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
might
be
inclined
to
purchase
it
again
if
i
were
conducting
an
assorted
brown
ale
tasting
but
its
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
by
any
means
still
i
think
bear
republic
has
done
a
nice
job
here
and
at
6
3
abv
its
a
solid
session
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
a
kick
i
think
this
would
go
just
as
well
with
a
bacon
burger
as
it
would
with
a
mexican
dish
of
chicken
mole
falls
off
a
little
on
the
flavor
very
straigtforward
lacking
depth
sweet
malty
character
milk
chocolate
in
character
thin
mouthfeel
with
some
bittering
hop
on
the
finish
some
nutty
dried
fruit
again
a
decent
beer
but
just
nothing
to
set
it
apart
this
was
a
really
good
brown
ale
while
they
are
not
my
favorite
style
i
can
say
that
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
another
victory
for
bear
republic
solid
not
thick
mouthfeel
leaves
a
little
astringent
character
in
the
back
of
the
throat
but
otherwise
is
a
genuinely
pleasant
drinking
experience
very
decent
beer
though
in
a
bears
lineup
of
big
very
flavorful
beers
it
doesnt
especially
stand
out
overall
impression
brown
isn¬ít
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
was
easy
drinking
if
you
like
browns
it¬ís
one
not
to
be
missed
d
tailgated
with
this
today
and
was
happy
that
i
brought
multiple
bottles
for
the
8
hour
party
to
drink
and
share
with
others
that
put
down
bud
lights
and
tried
a
bigger
beer
this
helped
get
a
few
converts
over
from
the
dark
side
d
smooth
and
easydrinking
brown
ale
that
falls
in
the
session
range
i
could
easily
drink
several
pints
in
one
setting
this
is
a
surprisingly
complex
and
wellbalanced
brown
ale
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
would
definitely
order
this
up
again
in
the
future
worth
trying
once
to
say
you
did
this
looked
and
smelled
fantastic
medium
to
dark
brown
pour
with
a
khaki
coloured
foamy
head
that
became
craggy
and
chunky
as
it
slowy
died
down
smell
was
huge
cereals
and
grains
and
was
rather
nice
taste
though
was
very
forgetable
it
wasnt
that
it
was
bad
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
just
that
there
was
a
sour
taste
here
that
i
didnt
care
for
not
a
sour
taste
that
would
lead
me
to
believe
the
beer
had
gone
bad
this
tasted
like
it
was
supposed
to
be
here
perhaps
it
is
just
me
nevertheless
i
didnt
really
care
for
the
taste
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
for
me
as
always
though
glad
i
got
to
try
it
d
complex
easy
to
drink
absolutely
delicious
awesome
american
brown
highly
recommended
overall
a
flavorful
brown
ale
very
good
drinkability
d
another
winner
for
me
from
bear
republic
grabbed
this
beer
as
an
afterthought
and
did
not
reget
the
call
i
keep
waiting
for
the
clunker
from
them
but
they
continue
to
amaze
get
any
thing
you
can
from
this
great
brewery
bottle
poured
a
clear
brown
color
with
a
thick
lightbrown
head
some
lacing
sweet
aroma
of
brown
sugar
malt
and
caramel
excellent
mouthfeel
flavor
is
coffee
like
with
roasted
malts
and
a
faint
brown
sugar
taste
to
it
a
good
beer
but
not
at
the
same
level
as
other
bear
republic
brews
dark
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
this
beer
makes
a
statement
with
a
big
malty
body
with
caramel
notes
smooth
finish
with
a
pronounced
malty
backbone
a
nice
food
friendly
beer
that
maintains
a
good
balance
it
should
be
noted
that
the
largest
chunk
of
brown
sediment
fell
out
of
the
bottle
very
strange
drinkability
is
subpar
because
of
the
sharp
acidic
flavors
i
hope
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
this
brew
was
certainly
not
up
to
bear
republic
standards
this
is
not
a
bomb
of
a
brew
light
notes
of
stoutesque
flavors
and
essence
reward
the
mouth
and
nose
not
a
blockbuster
brown
ale
but
nevertheless
a
good
ol¬í
american
brown
ale
warm
multifaceted
and
complex
through
warming
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
the
feel
is
thick
and
chewy
its
like
a
porter
but
milky
instead
of
dry
oh
and
it
remains
in
the
mouth
long
after
its
really
thick
sweet
and
balanced
tons
of
flavors
to
choose
from
coffee
caramel
milk
malt
take
your
pick
ill
just
have
to
keep
it
to
one
at
a
time
please
pours
a
nice
clean
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
very
nice
twofinger
plus
creamy
tan
head
lots
of
sticky
lacing
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
roasted
toffee
coffee
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
nice
touch
of
roasted
malts
some
toffee
coffee
and
caramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
brown
ale
another
tasty
brew
from
br
highly
recommended
still
wondering
if
bear
republic
makes
a
bad
beer
if
they
do
i
have
yet
to
have
tried
it
good
mouthfeel
for
an
english
brown
and
a
very
drinkable
beer
recommended
solid
brown
ale
nothing
spectacular
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
for
a
change
of
pace
every
once
in
awhile
this
is
my
kind
of
brown
ale
big
creamy
flavors
at
an
abv
that
could
easily
handle
a
session
ive
sampled
all
bear
republics
readily
available
beers
and
every
one
is
either
close
or
at
the
top
of
their
respective
styles
high
quality
brown
here
two
thumbs
down
drinkability
i
was
impressed
by
this
one
my
idea
of
what
a
session
beer
should
be
not
massively
complex
but
with
some
definite
discernable
pleasant
and
balanced
flavors
very
nice
offering
bear
republic
can
do
no
wrong
im
convinced
highly
recommended
into
a
nonic
pours
a
dark
brown
with
slight
ruby
hues
a
nice
creamy
plump
head
of
offwhite
color
and
nice
lacing
pretty
nice
nose
lots
of
malts
and
chocolate
brown
sugar
is
apparent
maybe
some
faint
molasses
lots
of
stuff
pretty
good
the
taste
i
cant
quite
appreciate
its
just
too
damn
sweet
as
per
the
label
description
lots
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
some
chocolates
and
nuts
playing
in
the
background
but
its
just
too
sweet
and
there
is
some
lactose
that
makes
it
really
difficult
to
drink
the
mouth
is
decent
otherwise
but
man
it
was
almost
difficult
finishing
this
one
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
this
brewer
but
this
one
just
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
drinkability
a
light
and
easy
beer
the
mouthfeel
threw
me
off
good
balanced
flavors
went
well
with
my
chicken
panini
the
taste
is
pleasant
enough
though
maybe
not
my
favorite
style
so
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
those
who
like
brown
ales
i
prefer
it
warmer
than
the
recommended
temperature
as
it
allows
for
the
more
pleasant
complex
smells
and
tastes
to
come
forward
ive
got
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
browns
that
ive
had
recently
well
made
and
deliciously
malty
this
is
a
fitting
tribute
to
anyone
its
not
the
best
brown
out
there
but
it
is
a
damn
fine
one
id
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
and
it
is
worth
seeking
out
this
would
also
make
a
damn
fine
session
beer
looks
appropriately
brown
with
a
large
creamcolored
head
caramel
and
butterscotch
come
through
strongly
in
the
taste
and
smell
with
a
slight
roastiness
and
mild
hop
presence
somewhat
overcarbonated
for
the
style
and
perhaps
a
bit
thinner
than
id
like
but
overall
very
drinkable
and
nice
good
but
not
great
somewhat
pricey
for
the
overall
quality
found
this
hiding
in
a
small
store
locally
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
rich
brown
with
red
highlights
and
fat
tan
head
and
good
lacing
big
nose
of
roasted
malts
and
citrus
hops
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
pleasant
slightly
bitter
finish
well
balanced
and
well
crafted
brown
ale
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
wish
was
more
readily
available
definitely
recommended
a
balanced
and
very
drinkable
brown
ale
pleasurable
but
lacking
in
distinctiveness
drinkability
nice
strikes
me
more
as
a
wannabe
stout
or
baltic
porter
but
id
certainly
drink
another
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brownishblack
color
dense
with
only
a
slight
reddishedged
hue
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
a
whitish
tan
presenting
beautiful
lace
you
can
tell
just
by
looking
that
his
is
a
fullbodied
and
hefty
beer
the
aroma
is
pleasant
a
serious
molasses
and
malt
nose
mixed
with
brown
sugar
burnt
honey
and
bitter
chocolate
the
taste
is
sweet
and
a
little
chalky
there¬ís
raisins
smoke
and
lots
of
highlyroasted
malts
that
come
out
in
the
taste
very
full
bodied
with
an
almost
syrupy
like
mouthfeel
this
is
one
serious
brew
i¬íd
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
one
of
these
drinkability
this
is
probably
the
best
brown
ive
had
as
far
as
balls
and
complexity
without
going
over
the
top
and
making
it
more
toward
an
imperial
or
anything
like
that
i
sure
wouldnt
mind
having
a
beer
like
this
named
after
me
and
at
around
5
a
bomber
its
certainly
worth
a
shot
especially
for
the
fall
season
right
now
which
i
suppose
is
almost
ending
in
richmond
overall
very
drinkable
but
could
be
an
excellent
beer
with
an
inprovement
in
mf
notes
the
nose
and
flavors
of
this
beer
were
very
good
to
excellent
and
other
than
that
wayactive
carbonation
it
was
a
nicelooking
beer
but
that
carbonation
really
killed
the
mouthfeel
and
imo
detracted
from
the
beer
this
is
one
beer
that
i
think
could
really
benefit
greatly
from
being
served
on
cask
but
from
the
bottle
its
still
a
solid
offering
and
a
tasty
brown
ale
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
will
buy
it
again
not
an
everyday
beer
surprisingly
substantial
a
better
candidate
for
cold
weather
drinking
than
i
thought
it
would
be
after
my
last
two
bear
republics
i
was
hoping
for
another
something
special
sadly
let
down
here
flavors
lean
on
the
sweet
side
but
nothings
really
there
to
me
mouthfeel
just
feels
thinner
than
id
hope
nutty
flavors
seem
to
be
the
most
prevalent
other
than
that
the
sweetness
almost
seems
nondescript
the
finish
is
what
really
killed
this
beer
for
me
kind
of
a
sour
acid
yeast
flavor
reminded
me
of
some
alesmith
beers
i
had
a
year
ago
i
dont
know
if
this
is
the
result
of
me
buying
an
older
beer
wheres
the
dating
or
the
yeast
strain
just
gone
funky
for
this
batch
maybe
ill
try
again
hopefully
i
can
sample
this
on
tap
somewhere
mouthfeel
is
thin
ok
but
not
great
drinkability
is
good
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
i
dont
really
want
to
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
nuttier
brown
ales
so
this
didnt
do
much
for
me
an
unusual
brown
ale
and
not
a
bad
one
at
all
my
first
beer
from
bear
republic
and
i
was
sufficiently
intrigued
by
this
to
try
others
as
they
become
available
sparkling
deep
garnet
short
quick
to
fade
tan
head
of
small
bubbles
subsequent
vigorous
pours
did
manage
to
generate
a
bit
larger
head
but
it
did
not
last
too
long
plentiful
carbonation
streams
float
towards
the
surface
aromas
of
deeply
roasted
brown
sugar
and
caramel
pair
with
a
molasses
sweetness
which
has
just
a
faint
note
of
burnt
wood
the
aromas
translate
directly
into
the
flavors
the
roasty
caramel
sweetness
is
present
initially
and
complimented
by
an
ample
malt
body
with
a
full
molasses
flavor
there
are
just
enough
piney
hops
in
the
finish
to
keep
this
from
becoming
cloying
and
there
is
also
some
dryness
from
the
roasted
malt
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
arrives
as
the
temperature
increases
mediumfull
body
with
a
firm
mouthfeel
and
fine
carbonation
there
is
a
dry
smoothness
about
this
no
problems
drinking
and
enjoying
this
one
d
ive
heard
people
bag
on
this
beer
i
thought
it
quite
good
a
good
english
brown
ale
is
the
most
under
rated
style
imo
very
smooth
in
mouthfeel
this
brew
has
a
nice
milk
stout
flavor
to
it
coffee
overtones
coupled
with
sweet
cream
nicely
cut
through
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
well
balanced
and
nicely
masking
the
6
3
abv
a
good
beer
but
not
what
i
would
call
a
brown
more
like
a
stout
nice
price
too
at

59
for
the
bomber
poured
a
very
ddep
brown
color
with
prominent
tannish
head
smell
is
excellent
with
a
strong
roasted
nut
aspect
mixed
with
rich
darl
mollasses
and
coffee
taste
delivers
every
promise
of
the
smell
with
very
rich
roasted
notes
and
a
strong
coffee
flavor
finished
rich
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
sensational
refreshing
fullness
truly
an
excellent
beer
pours
a
dense
dark
brown
topped
with
a
mountain
of
khaki
head
opaque
with
the
yeast
pour
great
head
retention
keeping
forever
the
foam
lacing
on
the
glass
in
large
blobs
big
sweetish
aroma
roasty
caramelly
malt
with
syrupy
molasses
and
nutty
overtones
hazelnut
and
walnut
the
flavor
opens
with
sweetish
dark
brown
toffee
and
gooey
molasses
creamy
on
the
palate
thicker
than
your
average
brown
ale
this
brew
gathers
quite
a
bit
of
character
at
room
temperature
nutty
and
fruity
lots
of
complexity
reminding
me
of
a
chocolate
and
walnet
cookie
with
the
little
bit
of
doughy
yeast
presence
bittersweet
roastiness
into
the
finish
a
bit
of
floral
hops
ending
off
balanced
and
fairly
fry
nice
sessionable
stuff
a
surprise
from
these
folks
light
on
the
hops
tasty
a
bomber
goes
down
rapidly
drinkability
pleasant
enough
to
drink
but
a
few
flaws
keep
me
from
enjoying
it
more
poured
a
lovely
opaque
brown
with
subtle
hues
of
black
and
amber
and
a
thick
flowing
offwhite
colored
head
leaving
behind
rings
of
lacing
aromas
of
grains
roasted
sugar
and
burnt
toast
seemed
to
come
to
mind
the
taste
was
just
incredible
with
a
dominating
malt
flavor
that
had
hints
of
mint
pine
and
caramel
in
addition
there
was
a
pronounced
smoked
flavor
that
underlined
the
other
flavors
sweet
and
malty
with
added
textures
and
bite
but
a
bit
too
breadlike
in
the
finish
excellent
drinkability
to
me
this
tasted
more
like
a
well
designed
porter
or
stout
which
i
really
like
rather
than
an
eb
ale
drinkability
one
of
the
most
drinkable
brown
ales
i
have
had
worth
seeking
this
one
out
this
brew
pours
a
cola
brown
with
a
nice
head
that
has
sustained
nicely
nose
is
malty
a
bit
nutty
and
has
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
very
good
just
a
right
amount
of
sweetness
to
start
a
bit
chocolatety
malty
and
nutty
and
finishes
with
a
dry
hop
complex
yet
subtle
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
nice
for
the
style
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
brew
that
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
another
nice
brew
from
the
folks
at
bear
republic
tribute¬ís
taste
touches
upon
cinnamon
stick
or
allspice
the
mix
of
robust
malts
with
a
hint
of
spice
is
compelling
brown
ale
is
a
fickle
style
that
can
taste
like
shoe
leather
if
not
executed
with
some
agility
tribute
is
a
fine
tribute
to
a
departed
friend
and
a
hearty
beer
style
overall
this
is
the
first
bear
republic
beer
ive
had
that
only
seemed
okay
its
not
a
bad
brown
ale
but
its
not
as
exciting
as
their
pale
ales
or
stout
and
the
thin
mouthfeel
really
got
in
the
way
of
things
for
me
more
boring
than
anything
not
one
ill
buy
again
uf
i
find
this
quite
enjoyable
not
a
true
big
beer
but
a
very
flavorful
brown
ale
sweet
without
being
sticky
nice
brew
would
drink
gladly
again
dark
maroon
body
the
head
is
moderate
then
fades
to
a
think
layer
of
tan
head
this
one
smell
very
chocolatey
like
frosting
maybe
a
hint
of
hazelnut
thrown
in
there
also
sweet
and
brown
sugary
in
the
nose
smells
very
good
taste
is
rich
and
sweet
slightly
nutty
but
this
beer
really
sufferes
from
its
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
a
good
brown
ale
except
for
the
wateryaspect
i
dont
know
pete
brown
or
anything
about
the
circumstances
of
this
tribute
beer
but
i
raise
my
glass
to
his
inspiring
this
truly
fine
beer
just
outstanding
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
had
pours
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
large
light
tan
head
aroma
of
roasted
nuts
sweet
malt
caramel
and
some
dark
fruitiness
this
beer
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
no
outstanding
flavours
just
a
blend
of
noncommital
flavours
none
to
define
this
beer
some
spiciness
malt
sweetness
and
slight
hop
flavour
medium
bodied
ok
drinkability
ive
had
better
from
bear
republic
the
initial
flavor
is
great
however
the
lingering
metallic
grapefruit
orange
and
resin
flavors
may
limit
a
session
tasty
and
mild
brew
here
super
drinkable
the
only
flaw
if
you
can
call
it
that
is
that
this
is
very
basic
no
real
subtle
flavors
or
scents
to
discover
it
is
super
drinkable
got
to
wonder
about
the
style
seems
to
be
really
a
good
porter
than
an
english
brown
ale
clear
with
nice
red
wine
highlights
not
much
foam
left
at
the
time
of
review
some
lacing
aroma
leads
off
with
a
mild
cocoa
note
and
follows
through
with
a
nutty
beeriness
mild
overall
aroma
taste
is
crisp
and
somewhat
fruity
with
a
distinct
wood
profile
backing
it
up
some
worn
leather
flavors
slightly
metallic
crisp
hoppiness
hides
any
of
the
chocolatenut
flavors
here
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
green
for
me
but
emerges
extremely
drinkable
for
the
6
why
does
the
label
call
this
beer
strong
is
6
strong
nowadays
anyway
a
tribute
beer
consumed
as
a
tribute
to
an
old
friend
cant
really
complain
about
that
i
would
have
no
problem
adding
this
to
a
shortlist
of
session
browns
body
is
a
touch
thin
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
almost
opaque
which
is
interesting
for
a
brown
nice
tall
tan
head
that
impressively
sticks
around
for
the
entire
glass
with
good
lacing
to
boot
aroma
is
delicious
nutmeg
cinnamon
nuts
toffee
and
roasted

taste
isnt
quite
as
tantalizing
but
still
quite
good
roasted
toffee
malts
holiday
spices
nuts
with
an
iced

aftertaste
like
newcastle
a
little
strange
but
i
enjoy
the
iced

aftertaste
adds
a
level
of
refreshingness
on
a
hot
august
night
i
always
love
a
good
brown
to
quench
the
thirst
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinnish
but
that
also
adds
to
the
drinkability
even
at

not
enough

sorry
to
say
not
much
of
a
tribute
im
suprised
since
everything
i
have
had
from
bear
has
kicked
ass
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
rather
thick
tan
head
the
smell
is
a
very
nice
mix
of
brown
sugar
caramel
and
a
hint
of
nut
expecting
good
things
i
was
disappointed
in
the
taste
it
seemed
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
never
lived
up
to
the
promise
of
the
inviting
aroma
although
it
seemed
on
the
verge
of
exploding
with
flavor
it
wound
up
retaining
a
somewhat
flavorless
dryness
based
on
past
experience
with
br
i
expected
great
thing
but
was
a
bit
disappointed
this
is
the
first
time
ive
rated

petes
brown
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
25
brown
ales
that
ive
had
to
date
bear
republic
does
not
disappoint
while
it
doesnt
rise
to
the
stratospheric
heights
of
their
hoppy
beer
this
tribute
to
pete
brown
is
a
fine
tribute
indeed
effort
by
bear
republic
very
thin
porter
or
dry
stout
fining
head
with
a
half
crescent
in
it
dark
brown
with
just
a
touch
of
ruby
to
hue
very
sweet
nose
like
raspberries
dipped
in
caramel
or
like
duncan
hines
brownie
mix
gargle
of
peanut
butter
cup
on
tongue
with
a
whisper
of
burnt
character
in
its
tailing
seems
almost
closer
to
a
rauchbier
nice
malt
foundation
this
is
a
palatable
offering
though
a
little
offkilter
for
a
brown
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
wonderful
crystal
and
roasted
malt
scent
that
is
almost
perfect
for
the
style
it
also
has
a
nice
floral
hop
aroma
that
balances
it
well
the
taste
is
perfect
it
has
a
creamy
and
sweet
crystal
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
earthy
with
a
hop
flavor
that
is
present
but
secondary
to
the
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fking
great
beer
i
love
the
taste
more
than
anything
it
has
so
much
going
on
the
hops
malts
etc
this
is
my
new
favorite
brown
ale
on
tap
at
bones
very
dark
brown
when
served
with
a
low
head
aromawise
there
is
some
intrigue
from
roatsed
cocoa
nubs
and
then
some
vegetal
notes
take
over
medium
in
body
the
flavor
is
all
about
being
roasty
it
starts
with
some
initial
grainyness
then
theres
some
vegetal
notes
and
then
the
roasted
flavor
takes
over
i
dont
think
ive
ever
used
this
word
in
a
beer
review
before
but
this
was
a
weird
beer
not
awful
just
may
have
been
in
weird
shape
everywhere
else
this
is
a
great
drinking
brew
the
mouthfeel
kicks
ass
on
par
with
the
rest
of
the
bear
republic
brews
ive
had
to
date
both
light
enough
and
heavy
enough
ya
know
drinkability
for
me
not
at
all
if
it
were
up
to
my
girlfriend
this
beer
would
get
a
4
so
i
guess
brown
ales
lovers
should
give
it
a
go
it
is

not
a
bad

o
this

version
blew
the

version
i
had
at
the

out
of
the
water
i
got
a
celeryparsley
green
flavor
in
that
not
here
from
the
bottle
just
nutty
bittersweet
malty
loveliness
just
about
everything
one
could
want
and
what
should
be
in
an
american
brown
ale
nice
work
flossy
had
on
tap
at
monks
good
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
some
toffee
and
nut
character
as
well
very
enticing
the
taste
offered
more
of
the
same
plus
an
almost
salty
flavor
that
at
first
seemed
out
of
place
the
saltlike
flavor
mellowed
and
there
was
just
a
tasty
and
well
malted
brown
ale
this
one
hits
right
where
i
like
brown
ales
smooth
creamy
almost
a
bit
chewy
with
a
dry
finish
really
solid
beer
super
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
wasnt
the
best
pour
so
i
cant
really
say
much
about
it
pretty
darn
roasty
sweet
and
malty
in
both
the
nose
and
flavor
slightly
woody
and
chocolaty
easy
drinking
and
tons
of
flavor
big
fan
of
this
o
now
this
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
ever
had
it
may
be
the
best
so
flavorful
and
rich
and
the
mouthfeel
is
as
good
as
it
gets
though
not
as
hopforward
as
dogfish
heads
india
brown
ale
iba
but
not
as
englishy
as
avery
ellies
brown
ale
the
beer
is
crying
out
for
a
pairing
of
savory
meat
loaf
with
redeye
gravy
do
yourself
a
favor
o
pretty
impressed
bet
it
would
be
better
on
draft
love
the
rich
dark
molasses
flavors
that
really
come
out
as
this
one
warmed
up
overall
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
brown
ale
some
small
tweets
with
maltyness
could
really
make
this
beer
great
this
is
top
notch
in
the
style
real
robust
nose
and
taste
with
an
incredible
mouthfeel
that
makes
this
one
drink
bigger
than
it
really
is
i
can
see
why
this
beer
is
the
winningest
offering
from
flossmoor
m
medium
bodied
but
on
the
lighter
side
o
a
very
nice
beer
with
great
smoothness
and
not
harsh
to
taste
after
taste
and
is
not
heavy
at
all
o
i
like
this
beer
better
from
a
growler
than
on
tap
or
from
a
bomber
the
carbonic
bite
dies
down
and
allows
the
malt
to
come
forward
and
showcase
the
complexity
of
the
beer
overall

great

overall
i
have
to

that
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
brown
ales
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
falling
somewhere
between
a
brown
and
a
porter
in
my
opinion
a
top
notch
beer
that
demonstrates
that
a
high
abv
is
not
necessary
to
impart
flavor
o
i
thought
the
smell
and
flavor
would
redeem
the
beer
but
the
mouthful
is
weak
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
one
o
nice
brown
ale
well
balanced
flavors
compliment
each
other
minimal
bitterness
quite
drinkable
wouldnt
mind
a
couple
glasses
of
this
o
this
is
only
the
second
brew
ive
had
by
flossmoor
station
and
it
wont
be
the
last
great
stuff
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
vibrant
dark
tan
head
smells
of
malt
sweetness
molasses
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
great
a
smooth
sweetness
with
a
nice
hop
balance
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
tried
thanks
bashiba
for
the
recemadation
i
will
have
to
pick
up
more
of
these
and
others
fro
flossmor

a
really
nice

22
ounce
bottle
for
6
49
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
pretty
much
as
soon
as
i
poured
the
beer
into
the
glass
it
started
bubbling
up
like
crazy
and
it
took
a
while
for
the
head
to
settle
down
enough
for
me
to
pour
a
somewhat
full
glass
aroma
is
nice
and
malty
it
smells
like
molasses
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
some
coffee
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
a
nutty
flavor
also
i
think
the
roasty
coffee
flavor
comes
out
stronger
in
the
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
but
has
way
too
much
carbonation
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
bad
bottle
or
not
but
at
least
the
taste
wasnt
affected
other
than
the
high
carbonation
i
think
its
a
good
brew
id
try
this
again
in
the
future
o
this
is
a
seriously
hefty
brown
ale
i
like
it
but
i
dont
love
it
something
is
missing
and
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
this
pours
a
deep
cola
brown
color
with
a
very
fast
fading
ebony
head
that
doesnt
leave
much
retention
pretty
thick
looking
brown
ale
smells
of
sweet
malts
hazlenut
as
well
as
some
espresso
and
chocolate
taste
is
very
smooth
nice
creamy
texture
with
more
chocolate
on
the
palate
nice
sweet
malt
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
not
much
carbonation
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brown
ale
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
enlivened
by
carbonation
but
overall
slipperyoily
with
a
drying
alcohol
finish
best
american
brown
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
a
little
dry
and
chalky
nicely
light
overall
this
is
quite
good
this
is
a
very
porterlike
brown
ale
and
one
i
would
love
to
have
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
so
readily
available
for
me
that
ive
always
taken
it
for
granted
and
passed
on
it
it
so
happened
it
was
on
sale
and
i
had
gift
cards
to
burn
so
it
made
perfect
sense
ill
definitely
be
buying
this
again
do
while
brown
ales
are
not
especially
popular
as
a
style
this
gem
could
make
a
believer
out
of
anyone
not
deathly
allergic
to
sweeter
beers
the
flavors
are
dynamic
yet
traditional
starting
like
dessert
but
finishing
in
respectable
english
style
it
is
comfort
beer
able
to
scratch
the
dark
beer
itch
with
ease
not
at
all
limited
by
its
style
another
beer
where
the
smell
promises
things
the
taste
doesnt
deliver
pretty
good
but
the
flavor
is
rather
simple
and
onedimensional
o
drinkable
but
kind
of
heavy
for
a
6
nothing
wrong
with
that
since
thats
how
a
decent
brown
should
feel
id
do
it
again
didnt
even
know
this
existed
before
it
was
shared
with
me
this
is
a
dark
dark
brown
beer
with
a
large
compact
very
dense
head
over
an
inch
thick
poured
into
an
english
pint
glass
the
nose
provides
a
nice
rich
caramel
aroma
with
a
dash
of
roastiness
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
flavor
offers
plenty
of
black
patent
cocoa
flavor
moderately
roasted
with
dark
chocolate
notes
hop
bitterness
is
moderate
but
increases
throughout
to
dry
out
the
finish
substantially
lightly
fruity
yeast
character
body
is
perhaps
a
tad
thin
but
otherwise
a
solid
offering
a
bit
light
in
the
mouthfeel
but
very
easy
to
enjoy
no
notice
of
alcohol
at
all
excellent
offering
i
like
this
beer
probably
the
best
year
round
offering
from
flossmoor
hands
down
i
would
drink
again
without
a
complaint
let
me
start
by
saying
this
is
a
very
good
beer
however
i
dont
know
where
the
brown
label
is
it
seems
more
a
porter
or
stout
enough
with
semantics
the
beer
dark
almost
black
with
a
frothy
brown
head
the
smell
is
chalky
dark
chocolate
good
the
taste
is
bitter
chocolate
with
a
hickory
smokiness
good
beer
for
a
porter
its
just
not
a
sweet
brown
which
is
what
i
wanted
pullman
porter
sounds
better
anyway
right
the
reveal
pullman
brown
ale
awesome
a
solid
american
version
of
an
english
brown
and
a
want
as
this
is
from
my
book
project
o
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brown
ale
really
a
great
sessionable
brew
cheers
o
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
loads
of
flavor
and
very
drinkable
o
for
some
reason
ive
always
steered
clear
of
this
beer
instead
choosing
to
focus
on
flossmoors
ipas
but
that
was
a
mistake
this
is
probably
as
good
as
youre
going
to
find
for
the
style
very
impressive
o
wow
this
is
a
really
good
beer
highly
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
o
a
really
great
brown
ale
i
like
the
bitter
chocolates
and
coffee
and
the
molasses
really
comes
through
to
make
it
a
great
lounging
around
on
a
cold
night
or
morning
beer
overall
a
very
interesting
and
flavorful
brown
ale
the
intense
charred
dark
grain
grain
presents
a
porterlike
character
however
the
finish
is
sweet
and
woody
like
a
brown
ale
easily
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
ever
had
great
beer
a
friend
of
mine
who
runs
a
liquor
store
got
this
in
fresh
a
few
weeks
ago
unfortunately
compared
to
some
barrelaged
brews
ive
run
into
lately
this
one
is
eversoslightly
deficient
compared
to
other
molassescoffee
influenced
brews
ive
tried
in
the
past
however
this
one
stands
out
like
a
champion
the
color
dark
the
head
not
so
thick
but
nice
lacing
the
smell
rich
the
taste
malty
sweet
upfront
slightly
bitter
carmel
after
mouthfeel
luxuriant
overall
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
very
drinkable
and
not
overthetop
abv
or
ibus
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
replete
with
some
interesting
dynamics
overall
this
beer
is
a
large
disappointment
flavors
are
just
not
balanced
and
the
lingering
odd
aftertaste
it
quite
horrendous
it
gets
worse
as
it
warms
as
well
overall
i
want
to
put
vanilla
ice
cream
in
it
and
make
it
into
a
float
really
wonderful
as
a
dessert
feels
like
a
good
fall
or
winter
beer
mouthfeel
is
more
sticky
and
thick
than
your
average
brown
ale
and
it
might
be
too
much
for
some
but
i
happen
to
enjoy
it
the
molasses
is
very
imposing
in
terms
of
taste
and
mouthfeel
and
it
can
get
a
bit
much
drinkability
is
harmed
a
great
deal
by
the
metal
and
uneven
alcohol
strengthmolasses
this
beer
could
be
so
much
better
that
its
disappointing
to
point
out
its
shortcomings
i
feel
bad
giving
this
such
a
low
score
since
i
can
see
how
good
it
could
be
but
i
couldnt
get
through
too
much
of
this
beer
thanks
to
awyeh
for
jumping
in
to
finish
the
job
o
overall
a
good
beer
the
metallic
flavor
hurts
it
a
bit
and
i
try
to
review
both
to
style
and
a
c
average
which
makes
things
worse
for
pullman
brown
ale
but
if
youre
reading
this
review
and
considering
buying
it
maybe
youll
be
more
sympathetic
regarding
the
metal
flavor
try
if
you
can
to
me
the
best
of
the
dark
beer
ive
had
at
the
flossmoor
station
a
pretty
solid
choice
from
the
menu
for
sure
d
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
brown
ale
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
would
love
to
have
again
drinkable
stuff
beer
is
a
little
thin
surprisingly
and
has
this
kind
of
late
lingering
bitterness
from
the
roast
it
is
not
unpleasant
the
lead
off
here
is
the
sweetness
giving
way
to
a
vacant
midpalate
and
some
nice
bitterness
coffee
roast
at
the
end
of
palate
it
tastes
good
but
i
think
a
lot
more
could
have
been
done
ot
connect
the
palate
throughout
d
very
drinkable
brew
nice
malty
brew
with
a
good
blend
of
molasses
caramel
and
coffee
i
recommend
this
brew
and
will
have
it
again
my
first
beer
of
the
day
first
ever
from
the
station
and
the
beginning
of
my
kapowski
day
adventure
in
flossmoor
slick
burnt
sienna
roars
into
the
glass
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
recalling
the
steam
at
trainstops
of
yore
the
air
abounds
with
light
maple
syrup
cedar
brown
sugar
and
a
soft
breeze
of
roasted
malts
maybe
its
this
air
maybe
its
the
beer
running
into
my
mouth
its
hard
to
tell
sometimes
but
i
can
distinctly
taste
brown
sugar
roasted
malts
light
maple
syrup
light
molasses
and
a
brief
fling
with
oak
okay
i
figured
it
out
it
was
the
beer
which
went
down
nicely
thanks
to
a
medium
body
and
a
light
moderate
carbonation
while
i
watched
the
fighting
sioux
get
taken
down
by
the
gophers
on
ice
i
didnt
want
to
put
this
one
down
things
are
boding
well
for
this
day
at
the
brewpub

d
this
was
more
of
a
porter
to
me
a
good
porter
but
undercarbonated
overall
a
good
brown
ale
with
lots
of
malt
charachter
and
chewyness
pours
a
moderatelydeep
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
mild
lacing
and
pretty
good
retention
the
nose
brings
some
light
cocoa
and
molasses
plus
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
toasted
bread
the
taste
is
some
roast
and
bread
plus
a
bit
of
chocolate
fairly
plain
but
backed
up
by
a
nice
body
a
good
brown
that
id
have
another
of
this
beer
was
pitch
black
with
a
small
light
brown
head
and
nice
enough
lacing
the
nose
is
very
chocolatey
and
the
taste
has
a
great
complexityi
got
notes
of
chocolate
of
woodsy
toasted
nuts
of
molasses
maybe
a
little
bit
of
coffee
with
a
very
hoppy
and
somewhat
bitter
end
the
two
people
i
allowed
to
take
sips
both
immediately
proclaimed
it
too
bitter
but
i
thought
it
was
a
great
beera
very
complex
delightfully
drinkable
american
brown
pretty
solid
overall
i
just
think
it
would
be
more
enjoyable
if
the
taste
could
mimic
the
excellence
of
the
aroma
all
in
all
it
seems
to
be
pushing
hoppy
porterstout
territory
but
no
matter
d
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
a
memorable
experience
ive
still
got
to
give
a
thanks
to
ryan
for
bringing
this
one
back
from
chicago
with
me
in
mind
d
overall
i
feel
like
this
beer
was
a
little
bit
more
like
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
with
that
being
said
it
is
very
balanced
interesting
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
not
sure
where
this
beer
should
be
classified
but
it
is
a
first
rate
beer
whatever
style
you
want
to
call
it
if
your
looking
for
the
usual
nutty
brown
ale
i
wouldnt
choose
this
beer
but
if
you
want
a
mix
between
stout
and
brown
ale
this
is
your
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
moderate
to
slightly
below
average
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
great
flavors
to
it
and
was
also
pretty
balanced
and
complex
at
the
same
time
it
almost
seemed
like
they
mixed
a
stout
and
brown
ale
and
managed
to
show
some
of
the
nice
characteristics
of
both
tasty
enough
and
certainly
substantial
for
a
brown
ale
id
like
to
see
where
this
one
would
go
in
a
bourbon
barrel
pours
a
black
color
15
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
hops
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
slight
oatmeal
and
slight
yeast
fits
the
style
of
an
american
brown
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malt
hint
of
coffee
alcohol
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
slight
wood
overall
good
aroma
body
and
blend
a
very
nice
brown
ale
that
borders
on
being
a
porter
big
and
ballsy
for
a
brown
worth
a
try
in
my
book
a
really
nice
brown
ale
with
lots
of
coffee
great
beer
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
sometime
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
slight
offwhite
tan
head
smells
are
coffee
nutty
and
some
caramel
tastes
are
malt
roasted
nuts
some
sweetness
with
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
good
beer
poured
a
viscous
deep
brown
bordering
on
black
colour
opaque
in
the
body
with
a
tinge
of
red
around
the
edges
head
was
creamy
and
frothy
and
tan
in
colour
minimal
lacing
but
the
retention
on
this
was
phenomenal
kept
a
solid
half
finger
of
head
on
this
throughout
just
gorgeous
aroma
is
nice
too
bouquet
of
milk
chocolate
caramel
molasses
sweet
and
rich
malts
taste
starts
with
the
rich
warm
malt
base
striking
the
tongue
initially
then
coating
the
tongue
with
a
fairly
simple
and
delicious
combination
of
molasses
caramel
toffee
and
a
touch
of
coffee
mouthfeel
is
full
low
carbonation
and
a
smooth
creamy
finish
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
of
each
sip
but
the
ibus
on
this
are
only
low
30s
from
what
i
can
recall
from
the
bottle
excellent
beer
drinkability
is
brought
down
a
notch
by
the
fullness
i
experienced
drinking
this
beer
22oz
may
be
a
bit
much
for
myself
but
to
each
his
own
4
5
d
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
browns
ive
had
pours
an
opaque
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
lots
of
lacing
smell
has
this
roasted
nuttiness
to
go
with
sweet
molasses
brown
sugar
and
a
faint
hint
of
chocolate
this
is
incredibly
complex
for
a
brown
ale
it
is
very
sweet
but
also
has
a
great
nutty
flavour
that
you
would
expect
with
a
brown
ale
very
creamy
mouthfeel
at
6
abv
they
packed
in
a
ton
of
flavour
into
this
if
i
lived
in
chicago
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
often
drinkability
way
more
depth
of
flavor
than
you
are
likely
to
find
in
any
other
brown
ale
with
6
abv
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
im
going
to
find
a
brown
ale
ill
like
more
than
this
outstanding
d
drinkability
is
really
high
for
me
the
flavors
are
bold
and
delicious
this
is
my
kind
of
big
brown
ale
3
54444
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
great
for
the
style
drinkable
d
this
went
great
with
my
burrito
or
pizza
enough
flavor
to
go
well
with
a
heartier
meal
as
well
light
enough
that
it
would
be
a
great
session
beer
i
picked
up
3
bottles
to
take
home
with
me
and
regretting
i
didnt
have
room
for
more
nice
low
abv
huge
complexity
and
great
flavor
make
this
quite
easy
to
drink
this
blew
my
expectations
away
d
easy
to
drink
could
actually
session
this
surprisingly
get
down
like
buck
rodgers
great
drinkabilitywell
balanced
and
very
flavorful
seems
to
have
more
of
the
characteristics
of
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
flossmoor
has
put
out
a
pretty
solid
lineup
but
i
think
i
will
pass
on
picking
up
this
one
again
unless
it
is
super
cheap
its
already
reasonably
affordable
so
no
complaints
there
i
think
ill
stick
to
their
ipas
and
just
ogle
my
last
bottle
of
wooden
hell
overall
i
debated
as
to
whether
i
should
review
it
or
not
but
ive
seen
a
few
reviews
describing
similar
experiences
so
i
figure
its
good
for
people
to
see
both
sides
of
the
coin
still
i
do
want
to
try
it
again
maybe
on
tap
itll
be
better
the
bottle
is
killer
though
pours
a
dark
brown
what
are
the
chances
with
small
head
which
leaves
little
lace
wow
this
beer
smells
good
molasses
brown
sugar
and
lots
of
other
deliciousness
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
very
enjoyable
i
wish
this
beer
was
a
little
thicker
in
the
mouthfeel
more
malt
perhaps
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
as
we
wind
down
the
past
decade
and
one
i
look
forward
to
having
again
cheers
damn
is
all
i
can
say
not
usually
much
of
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
just
excellent
browns
are
among
my
favorite
styles
but
this
isnt
one
that
id
recommend
the
taste
reminded
me
more
of
a
porter
the
flavor
was
bitter
and
astringent
and
it
had
little
fullness
of
flavor
this
was
a
bad
combination
of
a
harsh
scent
and
a
medicinal
taste
overall
possibly
my
new
favorite
brown
ale
i
really
liked
this
one
and
probably
could
have
polished
off
another
bomber
after
the
first
if
i
had
another
try
it
if
you
can
d
damn
good
a
real
fine
brown
ale
for
all
intents
and
purposes
i
cant
bring
myself
to
accept
this
as
a
brown
ale
its
just
too
roasty
and
substantial
regardless
of
its
6
to
be
quite
honest
nothing
about
it
is
brownalelike
to
be
honest
im
not
sure
i
buy
the
6
as
mentioned
above
i
think
i
detect
a
little
heat
and
then
theres
the
less
tangible
buzz
test
it
feels
like
more
than
6
d
really
tasty
stuff
here
with
more
flavor
than
your
average
brown
ale
pullman
has
a
lot
going
on
including
plenty
of
bittersweet
character
and
a
nice
chocolate
presence
as
well
tastes
alright
way
too
foamy
and
tough
to
drink
thanks
jon
for
bringing
this
one
back
a
malty
brown
not
too
sweet
with
some
chocolate
and
cocunt
nice
foamy
head
above
average
mouthfeel
somewhat
complex
hits
the
style
toasty
nutty
the
mollasses
and
appropriate
carbonation
fresh
enough
but
very
little
sense
of
the
hops
with
more
malt
pullman
brown
ale
would
be
one
of
the
best
american
brown
ales
to
have
ever
entered
my
glass
as
is
its
pretty
damn
delicious
and
just
does
earn
the
higher
flavor
score
i
do
believe
that
this
is
my
favorite
flossmoor
station
beer
to
date
great
job

nice

medium

very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
american
brown
ales
ive
had
to
date
great
brew
no
outstanding
brew
i
really
could
not
find
any
flaws
this
is
one
that
i
will
brag
to
my
friends
about
tomorrow
d
the
low
abv
makes
this
pretty
easy
going
but
the
fierce
bitter
roastiness
and
high
carbonation
are
turning
me
off
perhaps
this
bottle
is
too
old
still
has
matt
van
wyck
on
the
labelalthough
that
doesnt
mean
a
ton
as
god
knows
how
many
bottles
were
premade
before
he
left
but
theres
a
huge
disconnect
between
the
smell
and
the
tastefeel
ill
still
finish
this
bomber
but
i
may
have
to
try
this
ontap
to
make
sure
that
this
is
what
flossmoor
intended
overall
this
was
damn
good
i
was
actually
more
then
impressed
here
dare
i
say
nearly
blown
away
by
how
solid
this
one
was
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
grabbing
for
this
one
again
in
fact
i
am
looking
forward
to
it
d
just
about
as
good
as
i
remember
though
perhaps
ive
been
spoiled
recently
by
some
of
flossmoors
more
daring
beers
however
this
beer
still
stands
the
test
of
time
a
unique
american
brown
with
loads
of
complexity
and
a
wonderful
taste
and
feel
to
boot
flossmoor
is
easily
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
really
good
got
to
be
tough
to
do
a
molasses
brown
got
this
bottle
at
sams
in
chicago
a
few
months
ago
poured
with
a
medium
tan
head
and
a
little
lace
color
is
an
opaque
dark
brown
aroma
is
very
interesting
a
brown
with
molasses
strange
but
they
made
it
work
also
some
chocolate
nuts
toffee
cocoa
dark
fruits
and
something
else
i
cant
place
flavs
the
same
pat
says
it
reminds
him
of
his
grandmas
molasses
cookies
nice
finish
good
body
and
carbonation
superb
beer
picked
up
a
couple
of
bottles
for
the
flight
home
will
be
happy
to
have
them
over
the
next
month
or
so
now
am
very
sad
that
we
missed
the
ipa
tapping
by
a
single
day
d
this
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
like
i
said
earlier
i
rate
on
style
not
personal
style
if
i
was
into
this
i
would
gladly
make
another
trip
to
the
growler
for
a
refill
glad
i
split
this
with
someone
who
likes
their
browns
hv
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
just
the
right
level
of
carbonation
this
makes
it
a
thoroughly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
and
one
that
i
shall
return
to
time
and
time
again
dark
brown
almost
black
but
still
lets
a
little
light
through
theres
a
nice
12cm
head
tan
colored
sitting
on
top
it
leaves
a
little
lacing
and
remains
as
a
nice
ring
throughout
a
little
darker
than
expected
but
overall
about
average
looking
the
smell
is
of
sweet
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
cola
there
is
also
a
smell
of
earthy
slightly
herbal
hops
there
are
notes
of
roasted
malts
as
well
coffee
etc
the
molasses
isnt
present
in
the
nose
much
the
smell
overall
is
very
rich
and
interesting
with
all
of
the
usual
suspects
present
the
taste
is
really
nice
upfront
there
is
quite
a
taste
of
bittersweet
chocolate
theres
a
nice
sweet
and
bready
malt
presence
paired
with
a
beautiful
earthy
hop
presence
also
a
a
floral
hint
in
the
finish
theres
a
slight
taste
of
tobacco
and
a
nice
lingering
taste
of
molasses
in
the
finish
the
flavor
of
coffee
and
cola
comes
and
goes
in
different
stages
everything
is
in
there
in
quite
a
nice
balance
and
is
really
enjoyable
and
rich
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
ale
fullbodied
and
sweet
im
not
big
on
dryness
is
darker
beers
the
carbonation
was
pleasant
about
lowmedium
which
provides
a
prickle
with
no
sting
i
really
enjoyed
the
drink
but
maybe
12
would
be
enough
for
me
the
flavors
are
all
really
enjoyable
and
though
the
house
beers
dont
get
the
hype
the
ipa
gets
the
most
attention
here
this
is
one
worth
visiting
at
a
future
date
ill
have
to
try
this
again
but
at
this
point
i
am
not
impressed
while
the
carbonation
eventually
comes
on
it
almost
starts
flat
on
my
tongue
other
than
that
its
undeniably
drinkable
and
one
ill
be
sure
to
revisit
im
pleasantly
surprised
with
my
first
flossmoor
sample
it
drinks
closer
to
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
imho
pours
a
dark
drown
with
a
fizzy
mocha
head
nose
has
lots
of
roasty
malts
nutty
grains
chocolate
coffee
and
molasses
taste
is
also
quite
malty
but
well
balanced
by
the
bitter
molasses
and
cocao
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
nice
example
of
the
style
this
was
a
darker
brown
style
it
was
nearly
black
with
a
brown
head
the
smell
was
of
a
small
hop
aroma
perhaps
an
english
hop
but
also
you
could
detect
a
distinctive
roasted
character
in
the
aroma
the
roast
character
did
dominate
the
taste
too
but
there
was
a
definite
cideryness
that
would
be
most
likely
caused
by
the
molasses
the
cidery
character
was
not
unpleasant
but
perhaps
a
tiny
bit
unusual
finished
roasty
it
seemed
definitely
blackpatent
for
the
malt
this
is
a
good
beer
it
really
pushes
the
envelope
of
the
style
and
broadens
the
drinkers
perspectives
d
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
the
finish
was
not
enjoyable
i
had
a
better
thought
out
review
that
my
browser
ate
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
very
light
carbonation
silky
wow
another
staple
flossmoor
beer
that
took
me
a
little
by
surprise
i
love
the
roasted
nature
of
this
as
it
gave
the
profile
a
level
of
flavor
that
im
not
used
to
in
brown
ales
being
almost
porterish
at
times
full
flavored
and
hugely
drinkable
bottles
of
this
would
probably
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
get
it
locally
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
12
finger
of
tan
head
good
retention
and
some
lacing
smells
of
caramel
toffee
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
citrus
tastes
of
chalk
chocolate
malts
caramel
toffee
roasted
malts
and
coffee
with
a
bitter
citrus
peel
finish
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
a
little
minerally
and
chalky
but
overall
pretty
good
seems
almost
more
porterlike
than
a
brown
ale
another
nice
brew
from
flossmoor
station
quite
enjoyable
well
this
is
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
ever
tasted
flossmoor
continues
to
impress
and
this
is
no
exception
fantastic
brew
contrary
to
most
bas
who
shy
away
from
giving
perfect
scores
to
the
beers
they
review
here
this
offering
from
flossmoor
station
is
perfection
in
a
bottle
i
have
shied
away
from
flossmoor
station
only
because
22
ounce
bombers
are
harder
to
put
away
drink
solo
than
a
12
ounce
brew
but
i
was
in
good
company
on
easter
weekend
in
chicagoland
brother
in
law
and
nephew
both
former
macro
drinkers
now
craft
beer
enthusiasts
who
i
gladly
converted
so
when
my
brother
in
law
pulled
this
beauty
from
his
fridge
to
present
to
me
as
a
gift
i
said
lets
split
it
three
ways
and
wow
what
a
magical
experience
that
was
we
sipped
smelled
let
sit
then
smelled
sipped
and
did
that
over
and
over
again
the
taste
of
dark
unsweetened
coffee
like
espresso
hit
our
palates
a
silky
smoothie
pure
decadence
are
just
some
words
to
describe
the
onehour
of
beer
bliss
i
can
see
why
my
nephew
dreams
about
this
beer
it
is
heavenly
i
have
a
bottle
in
my
beer
fridge
but
will
wait
for
the
perfect
occasion
to
enjoy
the
flavor
caught
me
off
guard
and
i
had
to
keep
checking
the
label
to
make
sure
this
wasnt
listed
as
an
old
timey
porter
chocolate
ample
amounts
of
roasty
coffee
brown
sugar
chocolate
ash
a
touch
of
sourness
similar
to
coffee
and
a
plethora
of
floral
hops
on
the
finish
which
linger
into
the
aftertaste
to
mix
with
coffee
the
medium
body
leans
on
full
but
is
in
no
way
sweet
or
sticky
its
very
smooth
and
creamy
yet
a
nice
balance
is
made
from
ash
and
roasty
bitterness
theres
something
very
familiar
and
comforting
in
this
brew

served

in
a
12oz
glass
about
7
miles
from
the
brewery
very
dark
for
the
style
with
a
rich
chocalatey
aroma
creamy
thick
tan
head
a
heavy
beer
with
an
initial
sweetness
that
gives
way
to
lingering
bitterness
leaves
an
equally
strong
maltiness
with
flavors
of
smoke
and
coffee
pretty
big
for
a
brown
ale
ive
definately
tasted
porters
that
were
not
as
dark
and
heavy
pours
with
a
small
tight
brown
head
dark
opaque
brown
color
aroma
is
milk
chocolatey
slightly
smoky
starts
with
sweet
chocolate
mocha
flavors
becoming
roasty
and
somewhat
coffeeish
seems
a
bit
darker
and
roastier
than
expected
for
a
brown
ale
hint
of
burnt
bitter
molasses
in
the
finish
medium
body
alcohol
is
quite
moderate
and
sweetness
is
pleasant
not
cloying
i
am
typically
not
a
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
was
delicious
d
could
drink
this
one
over
and
over
again
works
as
a
one
timer
or
a
bit
of
a
session
a
great
american
brown
ale
drinkability
is
good
a
smooth
and
robust
brew
that
is
more
of
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
there
is
a
dark
malt
complexity
here
that
is
quite
nice
making
this
one
of
the
better
brews
from
flossmoor
cheers
drinkability
good
d
tires
me
easily
d
this
is
more
of
a
sipping
beer
maybe
one
or
two
and
not
something
i
would
drink
a
case
of
during
a
ballgame
interesting
brew
from
flossmoor
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
enjoyable
complex
body
pours
to
a
blackest
brown
that
it
can
be
hosts
a
thick
creamy
inch
and
a
half
head
that
is
dark
tan
in
color
with
excellent
retention
nose
has
an
almost
burning
invigoration
of
roasted
malt
smokey
alchol
and
paint
tons
of
rich
toasty
malt
enter
the
mouth
with
a
very
creamy
filling
feel
an
even
biscuit
like
sweetness
is
whole
and
pleasant
on
the
tongue
in
the
middle
of
the
sweetness
is
a
dose
of
molasses
that
keeps
the
mouthfeel
quite
thick
this
beer
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
tremendous
beer
and
hopefully
can
get
plenty
more
my
next
trip
to
chicago
thanks
again
joe
bottom
line
heres
a
nice
american
style
brown
ale
thats
plenty
tasty
has
a
good
mouthfeel
is
easy
drinking
and
looks
good
in
the
glass
a
solid
example
of
the
style
there
arent
many
brown
ales
i
particularly
enjoy
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
its
not
extraordinary
but
for
a
brown
ale
its
damn
good
the
dirnkability
is
fine
if
a
toast
brown
is
you
thing
give
it
a
try
prosit
mk
drinkability
fantastic
session
beer
alone
or
with
a
hearty
meal
had
this
brew
on
tap
at
flossmoor
pours
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
smell
is
nutty
and
coffee
like
and
taste
is
chalky
nutty
and
lightly
of
coffee
bit
thin
body
and
flavorwise
but
otherwise
a
good
drinkable
brown
ale
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
however
pours
a
very
rich
molasses
brown
with
a
tan
head
hat
is
fleeting
at
best
the
aroma
is
a
bronwnie
sweet
cream
with
som
bitter
burnt
malts
and
a
touch
of
rye
like
hops
the
taste
has
sweet
and
bitter
malts
the
molasses
mingles
very
well
ith
such
a
deep
roasted
to
burnt
malt
bill
with
good
hop
balancing
makes
me
thnk
of
sweet
mocha
brownies
with
adash
of
grapefruit
rinds
jumping
aroun
adding
a
spicey
note
to
the
mix
a
dark
sweet
mix
with
lots
of
chocolates
and
coffee
flavors
moving
around
your
palate
taste
like
its
almost
a
sipping
beer
but
lower
in
abv
tasted
on
43008
d
pretty
awesome
beer
drinkability
is
fantastic
super
smooth
drinks
more
like
a
hoppy
porter
as
mentioned
in
a
prior
review
reminded
me
of
surly
bender
in
some
ways
glad
to
have
this
available
in
my
area
recommended
poured
from
a
silk
screened
bomber
i
got
at
flossmoor
station
a
few
weeks
ago
pours
an
opaque
deep
brown
with
cola
colored
edges
the
dark
tan
head
slowly
dissipates
into
a
mocha
tinged
ring
around
the
glass
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
a
deep
inhalation
brings
coffe
a
little
chocolate
and
the
molasses
to
the
front
a
taste
and
you
know
why
the
smell
of
molasses
stands
out
the
taste
does
as
well
but
not
in
a
bad
way
the
bitter
chocolate
compliments
the
sweet
molasses
to
make
for
a
complex
yet
enjoyable
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
what
gets
me
im
not
a
fan
of
the
bitter
aftertaste
its
not
overwhelming
but
its
there
know
what
i
mean
pretty
drinkable
share
with
a
friend
d
incredible
ive
found
my
new
locally
made
go
to
brown
ale
6
means
this
is
sessionable
as
well
very
dark
brown
with
almost
no
head
scent
of
molasses
with
brown
sugar
coffee
and
a
bit
of
almond
initial
taste
of
almonds
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
and
molasses
brown
sugar
and
roasted
coffee
beans
round
this
one
out
mouthfeel
is
clean
a
little
thick
with
a
soft
bite
very
nice
very
drinkable
goes
down
nice
and
easy
drinkability
well
this
thing
turned
out
to
be
pretty
tasty
im
not
the
most
experienced
brown
drinker
on
earth
but
i
definitely
like
this
brew
its
nicely
balanced
and
really
drinkable
flossmoor
really
has
something
here
great
brew
and
i
cant
wait
to
visit
the
brewpub
a
good
winter
beer
freshly
tapped
at
my
house
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
brew
fills
the
glass
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
settles
to
a
small
head
over
top
with
a
mild
carbonation
in
there
this
brew
is
nice
and
dark
but
light
comes
through
at
the
top
around
the
lip
the
aroma
is
roast
with
a
solid
brown
sugar
toasted
nut
and
chocolate
the
smells
are
moderate
in
force
but
well
blended
and
nice
for
the
style
the
flavor
hits
first
with
a
solid
roast
that
moves
to
a
nice
nutty
quality
quickly
transitioning
to
milk
chocolate
and
finishing
with
a
moderate
pine
hop
that
gives
a
light
impression
of
coffee
and
a
mild
to
moderate
bite
on
the
finish
this
one
hits
all
the
notes
i
want
in
a
brown
it
has
a
robust
flavor
with
a
mild
nose
and
awesome
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
nice
mild
carbonation
of
fine
bubbles
it
has
a
nice
velvety
smoothness
that
really
works
well
drinkability
on
this
one
is
outstanding
though
the
flavors
are
big
it
is
easily
a
session
beer
and
will
not
be
on
my
kegerator
very
long
i
really
like
the
lingering
hop
flavor
on
the
finish
this
one
is
damn
good
very
dry
and
again
full
of
dark
bready
flavors
over
cooked
caramel
somewhat
burnt
brown
sugar
cane
sugar
bordering
on
mollasses
dark
fruits
chestnuts
dried
berries
and
a
freak
show
of
other
happenings
nicely
complex
with
a
nice
bittering
hop
adding
depth
and
balance
murky
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
thin
burntorange
head
and
very
respectable
lacing
natural
hazelnut
and
roasted
almond
scents
mingle
with
heady
cocoa
and
soft
floral
hop
aromas
very
enticing
deep
chocolate
flavors
spiked
with
roasted
hazelnuts
and
a
lovely
soft
yet
bitter
dark
coffee
taste
floral
and
eversoslightly
spicy
hop
notes
appear
here
and
there
more
cocoa
flavors
as
it
warms
with
an
almost
cinnamonlike
character
peeking
through
very
reminiscent
of
nutinfused
lightly
sweetened
mexican
hot
chocolate
its
rather
close
to
a
dark
mild
ale
in
my
estimation
but
its
nutty
character
definitely
marks
it
as
a
brown
mediumlight
body
with
a
soft
chewiness
to
the
mouthfeel
super
drinkable
if
ever
in
the
chicago
southland
area
it
is
certainly
worth
your
while
to
seek
out
flossmoor
station
to
pick
up
a
growler
of
this
stuff
its
always
on
tap
and
its
a
ridiculously
drinkable
session
brown
in
fact
id
say
it
defines
the
last
four
words
of
that
sentence
if
you
can
find
it
get
it
overall
impression
the
flavor
of
this
beer
was
a
little
strong
for
me
however
for
its
style
i
do
think
it
is
a
good
product
i
dont
know
if
this
would
be
a
good
one
for
having
with
heavy
food
but
it
was
good
nonetheless
d
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
more
of
an
american
brown
ale
or
a
porter
it
has
nice
big
hops
that
would
make
me
think
that
it
is
a
aba
but
the
awards
on
the
wall
are
for
best
porter
it
is
a
nice
beer
but
im
not
sure
why
it
had
an
alcohol
warmth
to
it
maybe
it
was
served
to
young
and
needed
time
to
age
this
was
dark
enough
brown
to
pass
for
a
porter
in
my
book
nice
nuttiness
but
also
has
a
little
chocolate
and
roast
that
really
makes
the
whole
thing
qualify
as
a
good
porter
instead
of
a
great
brown
ale
but
who
cares
it
was
tasty
and
as
long
as
its
tasty
i
dont
care
if
its
pushing
stylistic
guidelines
i
dont
review
by
style
guidelines
anyway
well
after
sampling
everythig
flossmoor
currently
had
on
tap
this
is
the
beer
that
went
home
in
a
growler
with
me
and
a
friend
good
englishstyle
hop
bitterness
and
complex
shades
of
coffee
nutmeg
maybe
even
hazelnuts
and
prunes
its
just
a
different
taste
with
each
sip
the
glass
im
having
out
of
the
growler
right
now
has
a
burnt
coffee
taste
to
it
chocolate
malts
apparent
a
roasty
malt
smell
on
top
of
a
hop
aroma
and
a
warming
alcohol
presence
this
one
is
a
winner
this
brew
pours
a
medium
head
of
light
brown
colored
fine
to
medium
sized
bubbles
that
were
mostly
lasting
and
left
a
fair
lacing
the
body
was
an
opaque
brown
color
it
had
a
coffee
malt
aroma
and
a
nutty
mild
coffee
flavor
another
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
the
fine
folks
at
flossmoor
station
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
head
that
disapates
rather
quickly
light
to
medium
carbonation
very
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
mollasses
pleasant
hop
taste
to
balance
the
malts
very
smooth

the
beer
pours
a
dark
garnet
to
almost
brown
color
with
a
light
chocolate
semicreamy
head
that
is
modest
in
size
the
residual
lace
a
fine
sheet
to
coat
the
glass
roasted
grains
and
light
hop
aromas
dominate
the
nose

is
slightly
sweet

is
middling
in

feel
the
finish
pleasantly
hopped
pleasingly
acidic
malt
dry
long
lasting
aftertaste
my
bottle
says
that
it
was
bottled
and
brewed
by
riverside
brewery
at
least
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
the
previous
riverside
beers
i¬íve
sampled
were
totally
without
merit
and
don¬ít
really
need
mentioning
this
beer
runs
along
the
lines
of
a
robust
porter
in
my
book
delicious
and
makes
you
want
to
have
more
than
one
closer
to
black
than
brown
in
colorcomplex
aroma
lets
you
know
this
is
a
big
beermolasses
oats
come
through
on
the
tastesurprisingly
smooth
mouthfeel2
or
3
pints
is
the
max
this
beer
is
brewed
and
bottled
exclusively
for
flossmoor
ill
by
riverside
ca
for
distribution
to
mjs
american
brewpub
club
i
wonder
if
this
beer
even
closely
resembles
whats
offered
at
the
prewpub
cheers
to
dogfish
on
making
me
a
so
very
happy
customer
with
this
wonderful
brown
ale
another
fantastically
unique
beer
from
dogfish
head
like
namaste
or
aprihop
indian
brown
ale
makes
a
strong
case
for
dfhs
other
beers
that
arent
really
as
well
known
as
their
60
or
90minute
ipas
at
least
not
in
wi
like
the
aforementioned
other
beers
indian
brown
ale
is
a
superior
and
unique
take
compared
to
the
standard
for
its
category
too
hoppy
to
be
a
true
brown
ale
but
too
malty
to
be
even
an
englishstyle
ipa
the
hops
take
the
edge
off
of
the
big
coffee
and
caramel
flavors
and
this
beer
feels
light
for
its
style
i
dont
drink
brown
ales
often
but
this
will
be
my
goto
from
now
on
the
beer
as
is
advertised
a
very
tasty
beer
almost
as
dark
as
a
porter
and
similar
in
taste
to
one
but
sweeter
and
with
some
hoppiness
very
full
flavor
and
very
smooth
i
dont
really
like
brown
ales
too
much
and
this
one
wasnt
great
either
this
is
the
dfh
offering
that
i
like
the
least
so
far
exceptional
in
the
wrong
direction
good
but
not
dogfish
best
this
is
a
great
brown
a
lot
of
very
heavy
roasted
malts
along
with
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
very
rich
and
nicely
balanced
brown
deserves
its
reputation
as
one
of
the
best
browns
out
there
overall
love
it
i
need
more
in
my
life
potentially
a
cellar
candidate
love
the
crisp
hops
in
this
rich
brown
ale
while
i
feel
like
it
combined
ipa
and
brown
ale
well
in
aroma
the
taste
did
not
live
up
to
my
expectations
smell
was
caramel
floral
piney
roasty
and
of
alcohol
body
was
a
bit
lacking
a
little
too
carbonated
taste
was
hoppy
cedar
and
bitter
malt
flavors
with
almost
but
not
quite
too
much
alcohol
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
coffee
colored
head
that
laces
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
heavy
flavors
such
as
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
scents
the
taste
was
nice
as
well
with
those
heavy
notes
being
well
paired
with
some
nuttiness
as
well
as
some
light
pine
from
the
hops
well
balanced
and
a
very
delicious
brown
ale
exceptional
and
unique
in
a
class
by
itself
dont
pass
this
one
by
enough
said
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
the
beer
was
interesting
the
alcohol
is
very
present
in
this
beer
this
isnt
for
me
i
liked
every
thing
about
this
too
sour
reminds
me
of
bells
oarsman
is
this
beer
supposed
to
be
sour
bottled
on
112114
was
delicious
with
a
steak
ideal
temperature
3749
degrees
sweet
malty
beverage
dogfish
does
not
disappoint
o
really
enjoyable
beer
in
a
style
i
am
not
generally
fond
of
with
a
name
like
indian
brown
ale
and
the
mention
of
wellhopped
on
the
front
i
expected
more
hops
but
im
actually
glad
there
was
less
theres
a
good
ratio
of
ibussg
here
o
one
of
the
best
browns
ive
ever
had
dogfish
hit
a
home
run
with
this
brown
ale
solid
malt
flavor
with
good
balance
of
hops
brown
ales
dont
stack
up
against
ipa
but
a
great
beer
i
enjoy
it
for
a
good
change
of
pace
this
is
the
best
bottled
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
balance
between
malted
and
hopped
flavors
is
excellent
and
i
am
always
excited
to
taste
the
full
dogfish
head
experience
1500
miles
from
their
brewery
excellent
overall
beer
must
try
for
anyone
as
far
as
brown
ales
go
this
is
fantastic
a
brown
ale
that
is
firing
on
all
cylinders
for
sure
beautiful
color
aroma
taste
and
feel
a
real
treat
i
wouldnt
have
believed
it
myself
till
i
tried
it
might
be
better
than
bells
best
brown
in
my
book
heaven
in
a
glass
creme
brule
meets
hops
heavenly
not
terribly
heavy
rich
variety
of
flavors
one
of
my
favorite
beers
when
its
on
tap
at
the
local
pub
this
beer
doesnt
get
the
love
it
deserves
its
amazing
if
you
havent
had
it
you
need
to
pours
dark
but
somewhat
clear
with
a
small
creamy
head
mild
brown
sugar
smell
with
a
malt
background
burnt
coffee
taste
with
brown
sugar
background
nice
mouthfeel
mild
carbonation
with
a
nice
finish
very
interesting
blend
of
three
beers
one
of
the
best
browns
out
there
o
i
am
not
crazy
about
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
top
notch
the
hops
and
the
burnt
sugar
set
this
apart
from
the
pack
of
boring
masses
in
this
style
well
done
dogfish
head
dfhs
indian
brown
ale
is
anything
but
boring
its
an
excellent
balance
of
malty
goodness
a
little
sweetness
and
caramel
and
just
the
right
amount
of
pizazz
from
the
hops
its
a
great
beer
for
drinking
with
a
meal
but
has
plenty
enough
character
to
stand
on
its
own
overall
jesus
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
strong
beautifully
balanced
flavors
of
malt
sweet
and
hops
wrapped
up
in
a
smooth
quaff
delicious
another
awesome
beer
from
dogfish
head
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
cant
say
it
blew
my
mind
rich
really
tasty
with
a
bit
of
extra
hop
a
bit
complex
but
quite
quaffable
and
still
no
real
wow
factor
pours
dark
with
a
light
head
not
much
carbonation
light
lacing
o
a
well
put
together
brown
hybrid
still
looking
for
that
brown
ale
that
will
stop
me
from
reminiscing
about
the
original
petes
wicked
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
subtle
red
tinge
almost
no
head
what
there
is
is
very
fine
lightly
carbonated
heavier
body
smells
of
sweet
and
dark
malt
leads
with
brown
sugar
malt
balanced
caramel
sweetness
and
a
fair
amount
of
hoppy
bitterness
lingering
finish
of
coffee
and
subtle
smoke
small
amount
of
alc
bite
on
some
finishes
an
interesting
while
not
outlandish
brown
not
bad
at
all
im
nota
huge
brown
fan
but
if
ill
order
one
itll
be
this
exceptional
coffee
notes
perfect
cold
night
brew
pours
the
darkest
brown
this
smells
of
carmelized
goodness
so
malty
and
smooth
with
rich
flavors
of
roast
and
molasses
not
usually
a
fan
of
dogfish
brews
but
this
is
one
of
the
finest
ales
in
a
class
of
its
own
overall
stellar
on
all
counts
i
bought
this
because
i
was
worried
the
60
minute
ipa
would
be
too
hoppy
for
my
friends
and
figured
this
would
be
more
balanced
i
was
right
and
won
big
on
the
gamble
everyone
loved
it
get
yourself
some
unique
blended
concept
im
partial
to
very
hoppy
beers
although
this
isnt
too
hoppy
its
a
good
slightly
hoppy
option
for
darker
fall
or
winter
season
beers
this
is
a
awesome
brown
ale
not
easy
to
find
in
pa
but
very
complex
fruit
coffee
and
very
malty
try
this
one
ive
said
it
before
and
ill
say
it
again
hops
have
no
place
in
a
brown
ale
decent
but
the
title
is
misleading
o
for
me
personally
this
is
the
best
beer
in
dogfish
heads
core
lineup
serious
drinkability
here
all
the
flavors
at
work
play
very
nicely
and
the
body
and
texture
put
it
over
the
top
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
was
on
tap
at
the
warf
pub
in
edgartown
ma
in
2012
and
it
blew
me
away
have
had
it
many
times
since
in
the
bottle
i
consider
this
to
be
the
benchmark
for
brown
ale
perfect
deep
brown
color
and
sustained
creamy
head
rich
malty
nutty
my
fav
for
fall
and
winter
sipping
no
more
sam
smith
great
brown
overall
one
of
dfhs
signature
that
aint
gonna
work
bro
beers
that
somehow
does
super
tasty
hybrid
of
a
brown
ale
and
an
ipa
i
paired
this
with
potato
chowder
and
a
sausage
and
it
was
the
perfect
winter
lunch
my
favorite
dfh
brew
id
say
glass
pint
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
that
for
me
unlike
most
reviews
here
did
not
retain
for
so
long
nevertheless
a
thin
ring
of
lace
persisted
throughout
the
drink
the
aroma
was
malty
and
also
reminded
me
mainly
of
coffee
there
was
also
elements
of
alcohol
i
also
detected
a
citric
aroma
that
reminded
me
of
orange
peel
the
taste
was
very
interesting
in
that
it
featured
many
sweet
malt
coffee
chocolate
caramel
and
sugary
tastes
yet
it
was
balanced
by
a
slight
hop
finish
that
left
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
finish
also
had
boozy
overtones
and
reminded
me
of
scotch
or
bourbon
ales
the
feel
was
creamy
and
full
bodied
with
slightly
low
carbonation
overall
i
was
impressed
by
this
brew
another
winner
from
dogfish
poured
into
a
snifter
dark
brown
pour
with
a
short
lived
khaki
head
sweet
caramelized
sugar
and
malt
atoms
sweet
chocolate
and
malt
nutty
and
earthy
medium
mouth
with
nice
carbonation
4050
came
back
to
this
one
after
awhile
and
it
was
just
as
good
as
i
remembered
short
version
roast
and
malty
sweetness
are
in
perfect
balance
and
finished
nicely
with
assertive
but
not
overwhelming
hop
goodness
to
say
that
this
is
a
wellbalanced
but
flavorful
brew
does
not
do
it
justice
what
i
really
mean
to
say
is
that
this
brew
manages
to
keep
three
intense
flavors
in
perfect
balance
in
one
brew
making
for
a
topnotch
experience
another
excellent
beer
from
dogfish
head
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
plenty
of
hops
with
some
citrus
as
well
which
was
unexpected
but
very
nice
a
great
beer
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
if
you
dont
like
coffee

brown

but
the
american
adaptation
is
true

really
kicks
this

this
is
like
no
other
brown
i
have
ever
had
to
me
this
tastes
like
an
ipa
that
a
brown
ale
fell
into
very
earthy
and
floral
flavor
with
the
roasted
malt
mixed
in
there
as
well
as
some
coffee
mouthfeel
was
very
carbonated
and
active
personally
and
i
especially
like
the
tartness
on
the
back
end
i
avoided
getting
this
beer
for
a
while
because
something
else
always
caught
my
attention

appearance

deep
brown
with

the

quickly
fades
away
to
a

the
smell
is
out

reminds

of
some
nice
creamy
milk
chocolate
with
rich
caramel
notes
there
are
hints
of
rich
fruit
and
char
to
go
along
with

the
taste
is
most
akin
to
a
nice
mocha
sweet
coffee
and
chocolate
there
is
a
nice
brown
sugar
and
char
flavor
that
goes
along
with
what
might
be
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
which
are
rather
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
a

watery

found
the
beer
fairly

i
was
really
excited
about
this
beer
d
i
love
to
drink
hoppy
brown
ales
like
this
d
very
good
brew
interesting
to
the
point
of
being
unique
perhaps
nice
balance
and
flavors
that
match
my
palate
my
wifes
too
she
loved
it
as
much
as
i
did
when
we
tried
it
in
dc
err
i
tried
and
she
downed
two
pints
recommended
d
delcious
complex
and
well
hidden
abvs
outstanding
one
of
the
best
dogfish
beers
and
one
of
my
personal
favorites
would
love
a
case
of
this
to
drink
regularly
d
this
is
a
brown
ale
on
steroids
and
i
like
it
on
tap
seems
to
pour
and
sit
darker
than
from
bottle
deep
dark
pour
sits
like
a
porter
aroma
is
quite
light
some
dark
malt
and
hop
but
too
light
and
not
nearly
as
aromatic
as
the
bottle
taste
is
sort
of
black
coffeelike
which
is
interesting
because
i
never
noticed
that
too
much
from
the
bottle
all
the
key
flavors
are
certainly
present
with
same
complexity
as
bottlebrown
scotch
ale
ipa
very
deep
and
rich
mouth
is
full
and
a
bit
thick
very
tasty
very
good
all
around
though
it
could
be
tough
to
drink
a
bunch
this
is
a
big
tasty
brown
ale
lots
going
on
here
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
this
again
a
deep
brown
nearly
black
color
the
head
isnt
huge
but
its
certainly
there
the
aroma
and
flavor
both
have
a
roasted
nuttiness
and
almost
fruitiness
to
it
theres
almost
a
cooked
brown
sugar
lingering
flavor
that
is
a
little
bitter
its
pretty
complex
but
the
mouth
feel
is
surprisingly
light
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
too
seems
pretty
similar
to
a
porter
and
im
really
enjoying
it
d
a
great
brown
ale
more
potent
than
most
but
definitely
up
there
in
my
favs
of
the
style
however
i
remember
this
to
contain
more
hop
presence
could
it
be
that
the
age
on
it
diminished
it
nonetheless
it
is
balanced
with
good
attributes
a
perfect
fall
beer
in
my
opinion
will
review
it
again
when
i
find
a
fresher
one
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
bottled
on
021009
sampled
on
august
11
2009
it
has
a
handsome
dark
brown
pour
with
about
a
quarter
inch
beige
head
that
dissolves
the
lacing
sticks
well
to
the
side
of
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
a
fabulous
nutty
and
malty
mixture
with
no
immediate
sense
of
the
7
2
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
medium
the
taste
is
sweet
and
nutty
with
little
along
the
lines
of
hops
as
advertised
but
this
is
a
fine
brown
ale
overall
this
beer
is
a
nice
nutty
sweet
porterish
brown
but
not
unique
enough
to
stand
out
in
its
class
12oz
blind
tasting
poured
brown
with
reddish
hues
when
held
to
the
light
a
foamy
beige
head
held
great
retention
and
left
some
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
as
it
dissipated
it
left
a
thin
layer
of
foam
atop
the
ale
aromas
were
of
bakers
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
tastes
were
of
milk
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
molasses
leaving
a
slightly
bitter
finish
although
it
still
finishes
sweet
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
i
enjoyed
this
offering
much
more
than
previous
times
so
maybe
the
blind
tasting
offered
a
fair
playing
field
this
beer
is
a
homerun
i
will
always
love
and
drink
this
beer
try
some
pours
a
deep
brown
color
its
got
the
characteristic
brown
ale
flavor
with
some
caramel
and
a
big
dry
hop
punch
i
like
brown
ales
and
i
like
hops
but
the
flavors
seemed
unintegrated
to
me
i
would
have
preferred
they
blend
more
not
my
favorite
dogfish
head
brew
though
it
was
refreshing
served
cold
on
a
hot
day
cheers
this
beer
is
like
a
porter
and
maybe
even
a
stout
this
would
make
an
outstanding
after
dinner
drink
enjoyable
to
drink
and
maybe
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
dfh
not
as
drinkable
as
other
browns
ive
had
but
definitely
tasty
526
had
this
again
and
really
liked
it
maybe
better
the
roasty
aroma
was
great
i
will
be
changing
my
numbers
notes
had
this
beer
along
with
a
chocolate
and
pralines
torte
absolutely
exquisite
pairing
im
not
sure
how
sessionable
this
is
call
me
a
lightweight
but
i
was
starting
to
feel
a
buzz
after
just
one
of
these
md
the
flavour
is
not
that
different
from
a
porter
ale
if
you
ask
me
but
the
body
is
much
lighter
and
focused
on
nutty
malts
like
a
brown
ale
truly
the
finishing
touch
is
slightly
more
sourlactic
than
my
palate
prefers
though
id
rate
it
higher
if
the
carbonation
was
softer
and
the
hoppiness
could
somehow
outshine
the
present
balance
for
the
flavour
profile
but
all
in
all
this
ale
is
not
bad
at
all
t
i
loved
this
beer
slight
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
with
a
slight
little
hopiness
that
is
just
noticeable
enough
nicely
complex
flavors
i
just
couldnt
stop
drinking
it
and
couldve
easily
spent
the
entire
night
there
having
this
cask
conditioned
ale
overall
another
hit
for
me
from
dfh
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
to
date
bottle
from
my
friend
chris
a

murky
brown

thick
and
foamy
mocha

some

a
bit
of
hoisin
leafy
greens
and
fresh
bitter

perhaps
a
bit
sweet
for
me
to
have
any
more
than
one
thanks
chris
i
actually
reduced
some
of
the
ratings
from
the
all5s
i
originally
gave
it
to
really
score
it
like
i
would
today
however
this
beer
still
rates
as
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
d
a
fine
brew
here
from
dfh
probably
one
of
my
favorites
from
them
id
have
a
good
night
with
a
few
of
these
a
great
brew
indeed
a
very
balanced
very
drinkable
brew
from
dfh
one
of
the
best
from
dfh
stellar
indeed
d
in
spite
of
the
abv
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
good
good
stuff
here
drinkability
i
could
see
myself
drinking
3
maybe
even
4
of
these
bad
boys
in
a
session
the
brew
keeps
changing
in
the
glass
it
gets
more
complex
and
interesting
as
you
let
it
sit
which
becomes
an
increasingly
difficult
feat
to
accomplish
what
an
excellent
beer
i
had
never
tried
this
before
and
am
blown
away
how
good
it
is
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
style
i
typically
reach
for
but
this
is
a
winner
general
overall
i
am
an
ipa
fan
yet
not
always
a
lover
of
brown
ales
yet
this
very
nicely
combines
the
two
one
damn
fine
beer
and
at
7
2
it
is
truly
top
shelf
so
full
tasting
so
deep
in
flavour
fantastic
d
i
cant
say
id
be
too
eager
to
pick
up
another
one
drinks
down
ok
but
better
than
average
what
a
great
discovery
i
have
considered
buying
this
for
some
time
but
thought
indian
brown
ale
sounded
like
an
overly
hoped
brown
ale
and
didnt
grab
me
completely
the
appearance
is
a
dark
dark
brown
when
held
up
to
the
light
its
the
color
of
an
old
penny
the
two
finger
head
was
tan
and
reduced
to
half
in
a
few
minutes
the
nose
was
coffee
caramel
raisin
brown
sugar
the
taste
was
the
same
with
a
bit
of
booziness
in
a
good
way
there
is
a
hint
of
lactose
too
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
smooth
extremely
drinkable
wow
what
a
tasty
beer
maybe
my
favorite
brown
ale
dogfish
head
scores
again
wish
i
had
access
to
this
all
the
time
could
drink
plenty
12oz
bottle
poured
a
super
dark
brown
body
with
a
thin
off
white
head
with
decent
lacing
smells

bready
spices
taste
was
very
spicy
slight
alcohol
burn
dark
fruits
nutty
and
coffee
in

finish
medium
to
full
fizzy
bodied
this
was
a
pretty
hot
beer
for
7
2
d
excellent
a
complex
and
robust
brew
but
still
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
these
till
i
went
blind
well
worth
a
try
let
me
first
say
that
im
a
big
beer
lover
and
i
have
long
been
searching
for
a
session
beer
at
7
2
its
a
bit
much
perhaps
but
its
so
drinkable
i
want
to
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
along
with
a
chocolate
yeti
or
something
truly
big
thats
good
drinking
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
bought
a
case
of
any
beers
but
i
did
for
this
one
to
me
it
has
a
near
perfect
combination
of
flavors
the
malts
and
hops
just
blend
so
perfectly
well
have
you
ever
walked
into
a
brewery
and
smelled
it
and
realized
you
wanted
a
beer
that
tastes
like
that
smell
well
here
it
is
excellent
brew
sam
excellent
overall
very
solid
brown
ale
with
a
nice
hoppy
bent
this
is
an
amazing
and
unique
beer
one
of
my
favorite
american
craft
beers
a
masterpiece
drinkability
great
sipping
beer
almost
too
much
flavor
for
multiple
beers
this
is
a
brown
ale
on
crack
the
feel
is
milky
but
thick
a
little
ashy
but
fits
perfectly
for
style
its
so
dry
and
rich
that
repeats
are
a
must
drinkability
good
but
would
be
better
by
a
roaring
fire
or
after
having
raked
leaves
on
a
crisp
day
notes
and
comments
nice
balance
the
beer
exhibits
characteristics
of
each
of
the
three
beer
styles
that
inspired
it
american
brown
scottish
ale
and
india
pale
ale
d
a
great
tasting
complex
beer
so
its
certainly
enjoyable
to
drink
the
high
abv
prevets
it
from
being
a
great
session
beer
overall
indian
brown
is
an
excellent
beer
okay
as
a
drink
on
its
own
its
not
bad
but
i
have
a
hard
time
calling
this
a
brown
ale
its
much
more
porterlike
and
is
not
at
all
sessionable
very
rich
this
would
make
a
nice
dessert
beer
paired
with
chocolate
or
tobacco
for
that
matter
but
i
dont
find
it
particularly
enjoyable
theres
something
in
the
middle
palate
of
this
beer
that
just
doesnt
work
for
me
a
sort
of
medicinal
soury
sort
of
taste
and
the
alcohol
is
not
well
hidden
either
this
is
the
third
time
ive
had
this
beer
different
batches
too
and
it
just
doesnt
suit
me
unfortunately
i
find
that
sort
of
sad
and
suprising
because
i
love
most
of
dfhs
beers
well
at
least
they
have
plenty
of
other
flavors
for
me
to
drink
it
took
me
a
really
long
time
to
finish
the
first
one
then
i
took
a
break
involving
an
ipa
and
a
sandwich
with
corned
beef
in
it
i
came
back
to
this
fellow
after
the
break
to
give
it
another
try
and
could
barely
finish
the
second
one
this
is
not
a
session
beer
this
is
a
full
body
experience
an
odyssey
of
a
beer
fraught
with
taste
and
peril
edit
note
this
has
got
to
be
my
favorite
dfh
brew
from
the
time
i
had
it
on
tap
to
me
having
it
in
the
bottle
has
solidified
this
notion
it
is
nicely
hopped
and
really
cleans
up
the
flavors
to
make
this
such
a
sessionable
beer
a
brew
that
should
be
tried
by
every
craft
beer
lover
alike
absoloutley
a
home
run
side
note
best
brown
ive
ever
had
taste
is
just
great
starts
as
a
little
bit
of
an
oily
crusty
blend
and
gives
way
to
a
great
oaken
flavor
that
just
warms
you
up
if
its
cold
out
there
heavy
on
the
grains
and
the
hops
are
beautifully
balanced
against
an
exquisite
malt
brew
with
a
lot
of
nutty
flavors
mixed
in
with
some
chocolate
themes
thumbs
up
and
high
fives
to
sam
and
the
guys
at
dfh
for
making
whats
essentially
the
year
round
version
of
their
chicory
stout
d
for
its
abv
this
beer
drinks
rather
easily
its
sweetness
isnt
excessive
and
is
cleaned
up
by
the
hops
making
a
good
anytime
beer
if
only
these
were
available
in
this
state
and
a
little
fresher
d
very
drinkable
i
only
wish
it
was
a
little
lower
in
abv
cause
its
so
good
you
dont
wanna
put
it
down
i
think
this
is
probably
going
to
be
a
beer
i
have
in
the
fridge
all
the
time
if
you
have
the
chance
to
try
this
you
wont
be
disapointed
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
nice
creamy
brown
head
that
laces
well
smells
of
chocolate
smoke
malt
molasses
tree
fruits
taste
is
malty
and
nutty
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
as
well
overall
im
not
impressed
with
the
taste
too
much
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
drinkability
is
just
above
average
with
the
complexity
of
flavor
in
this
beer
you
should
sit
down
and
drink
it
slowly
and
you
may
want
to
have
more
than
one
just
so
you
can
go
back
to
when
it
was
first
poured
and
relive
every
moment
of
that
initial
glass
drinkability
at
7
2
abv
this
american
brown
might
be
on
the
high
edge
of
the
sessionable
beers
but
the
smoothness
and
variety
of
flavors
definitely
make
me
want
to
sample
a
few
of
these
christened
my
new
sam
adams
turbulator
pint
glass
with
this
excellent
brew
pours
a
dark
brownnear
black
color
with
a
small
foamy
tan
head
the
smell
is
pretty
amazing
deep
dark
sweet
roasted
chocolate
with
hints
of
toffee
it
really
is
more
like
a
porterstout
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
also
sweet
a
little
bitter
with
a
nice
coffee
aftertaste
its
bitterness
coupled
with
a
potent
7
20
abv
makes
it
perhaps
a
difficult
beer
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
but
it
really
is
a
beautiful
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
slowly
overall
i
could
drink
this
every
day
this
is
a
brown
ale
that
transitions
well
to
summer
heat
with
a
strong
hop
presence
but
without
the
acrid
taste
of
many
ipas
the
day
i
first
had
this
beer
the
outside
temp
was
hovering
around
90f
and
it
was
brilliant
but
i
can
see
it
carrying
over
well
into
the
cooler
months
with
its
heavierthanaverage
for
a
brown
body
and
slightly
smoked
character
i
would
recommend
this
especially
to
people
hesitant
to
try
extremely
hoppy
beers
pours
a
mediumthick
dark
brown
like
a
lighter
stout
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
or
lacing
smells
pretty
hoppy
at
first
so
i
think
uh
oh
but
then
i
get
a
whiff
of
a
sweet
brown
sugar
and
all
is
well
taste
is
just
like
a
hoppy
but
well
balanced
brown
maybe
a
little
less
burnt
malt
and
a
little
more
caramelized
instead
got
a
bit
of
a
sweet
kick
buried
in
there
but
all
of
the
sweet
is
balanced
out
by
some
healthy
hopping
maybe
a
little
low
in
carbonation
but
not
that
big
of
an
issue
after
a
bit
is
pretty
easy
drinking
definitely
a
different
beer
and
one
worth
checking
out
d
i
wouldnt
say
that
its
sessionable
just
cause
of
the
high
abv
thats
just
my
opinion
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
its
just
that
brown
ales
dont
happen
to
be
my
favorite
little
too
roasty
for
my
taste
i
do
appreciate
this
beer
though
d
awesome
beer
of
this
style
a
very
tasty
drinkable
brown
ale
d
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
highly
recommended
it
doesnt
get
overly
sweet
as
you
continue
to
drink
as
other
brown
ales
d
very
good
beer
has
a
nice
balance
and
goes
down
really
easy
i
like
the
hops
in
this
which
is
different
for
a
standard
brown
ale
but
very
welcome
great
beer
i
really
like
this
beer
to
my
tastes
it
is
a
symphony
of
contradictions
that
works
very
well
as
a
whole
probably
too
expensive
to
buy
all
the
time
but
its
so
damn
smooth
that
i
may
make
it
a
regular
almost
everyone
will
find
something
to
like
if
not
love
about
this
beer
two
thumbs
up
d
great
brown
ale
its
still
one
of
my
favorites
great
tasting
beer
drinks
very
well
it
my
go
to
bbq
beer
seem
to
always
drink
a
few
of
these
when
i
am
grilling
or
just
entertaining
outside
comment
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
just
not
what
i
think
a
brown
ale
is
id
say
it
is
a
great
porter
the
appearence
was
spectacular
i
actually
took
pictures
afterwards
it
left
microtiny
bubblesall
thick
and
creamy
looking
that
left
rings
after
every
gulp
i
took
i
have
never
seen
this
before
the
taste
didnt
leave
that
grittiness
i
talked
about
it
was
much
smoothera
more
roasted
flavoring
as
well
the
smell
dumbed
down
a
little
bit
not
much
came
through
mouth
and
drinkability
stayed
the
same
i
have
found
a
new
favorite
from
dogfish
head
wonderfully
quaffable
if
slightly
intoxicating
at
7
2
absolutely
a
goto
beer
one
of
my
standards
edit
by
the
way
honey
roasted
peanuts
with
this
beer
oh
yeah
medium
body
smooth
with
acidic
note
later
one
moderate
carbonation
is
lightly
prickly
upfront
with
moments
of
creaminess
rereviewed
on
12302013
nice
carbonation
and
despite
the
higher
abv
a
nice
sipper
dexcellent
i
could
sit
and
drink
these
all
night
i
have
give
full
disclosure
this
is
and
always
will
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
d
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
myself
in
fact
its
time
for
another
one
d
i
would
not
mind
one
or
two
of
these
per
sitting
but
thatd
be
about
it
its
a
heavy
one
its
a
great
complementary
dinner
beer
i
can
imagine
myself
grilling
up
gourmet
hamburgers
and
serving
this
one
with
it
d
not
exactly
my
glass
of
beer
but
i
can
see
how
it
can
be
enjoyable
had
on
tap
at
local
44
in
philly
poured
a
thick
dark
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
barely
faded
smell
was
malty
and
toasty
with
some
sweetness
taste
was
intense
and
full
creamy
toffee
and
chocolate
coffee
and
toasty
incredible
balance
and
warming
alcohol
incredibly
smooth
i
could
have
these
all
night
phenomenal
brown
ale
this
is
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
i
wish
i
had
more
than
just
the
one
thanks
krista
i
love
you
baby
allaround
this
one
is
extremely
tough
to
pinpoint
stylistically
a
hoppedup
brown
the
nuttiness
suggests
it
but
perhaps
a
coneinfused
doppelbock
fits
the
bill
its
tough
to
say
but
either
way
this
is
one
worldclass
brew
even
if
or
perhaps
because
it
defies
worldly
standards
im
not
sure
why
ive
taken
so
long
to
make
my
way
to
this
beer
i
love
a
good
brown
ale
and
a
hoppy
brown
ale
is
even
better
i
certainly
wont
make
the
mistake
of
passing
by
this
again
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
dark
chestnut
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
dense
creamy
ecru
foam
notes
from
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
of
milk
chocolate
coated
caramels
brown
sugar
a
touch
of
fresh
roasted
bitter
coffee
molasses
figs
and
sweet
malts
maybe
a
notch
above
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
d
a
bit
too
harsh
to
be
considered
overly
drinkable
maybe
the
cellar
would
do
this
one
good
highly
recommended
d
drinks
well
i
will
get
again
d
very
nice
beer
perhaps
my
favorite
of
the
yearround
sixpack
offerings
d
a
really
good
offering
from
dfh
worthy
of
a
try
to
change
up
the
pace
a
bit
overall
impression
great
beer
with
big
complex
flavors
and
aroma
this
is
fun
beer
to
drink
taste
and
enjoy
as
it
doesnt
match
any
particular
style
i
am
in
wonder
to
where
the
hops
were
hid
for
a
50
ibu
beer
i
would
expect
the
hops
to
be
more
prominent
its
fun
to
try
and
define
yet
is
doesnt
match
any
style
it
takes
the
best
characteristic
from
different
beers
and
combines
into
a
great
beer
d
i
loved
sipping
this
beer
it
was
really
tasty
and
would
go
well
with
a
sticky
bun
or
other
dessert
i
gave
this
particular
brew
a
5
for
drinkability
i
know
what
youre
thinking
its
a
7
2
beer
whenever
this
beer
is
around
i
seem
to
blissfully
forget
about
this
fact
so
then
yes
is
has
great
drinkability
if
you
dont
mind
getting
very
drunk
all
in
all
the
aromatic
malt
and
the
generous
hopping
create
a
unique
and
lifting
taste
d
nice
brew
that
was
lacking
some
in
the
hops
department
but
still
very
drinkable
ill
probably
keep
trying
but
dogfish
head
keeps
letting
me
down
d
i
couldnt
drink
more
then
a
few
both
because
of
the
abv
and
the
strong
flavor
the
smoke
doesnt
make
it
really
drinkable
but
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
for
what
it
is
the
taste
is
complicated
and
has
a
slightly
smokey
aftertaste
a
thoroughly
pleasant
beer
to
drink
disturbingly
high
alcohol
content
for
how
easily
the
beer
drinks
this
and
90
minute
are
probable
the
only
dogfish
head
beers
ive
had
that
i
would
drink
every
day
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
unlike
any
i
have
had
before
the
balance
of
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
is
great
definitely
an
interesting
combination
of
styles
worth
trying
rich
toasted
malts
with
a
hit
of
hop
waft
up
from
the
brew
deep
toasted
malt
flavors
flow
through
the
entire
drink
from
start
to
finish
the
alcohol
burn
appears
at
the
front
end
but
gets
washed
away
the
flavor
hangs
around
far
after
your
last
sip
the
carbonation
is
lively
in
the
mouth
as
you
drink
this
full
bodied
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
the
desire
for
more
d
good
drinkability
for
a
7
2
abv
d
thick
and
hearty
good
to
sip
on
pretty
heavy
for
an
brown
ale
but
it
fits
the
style
one
that
dogfish
created
and
calls
a
cross
between
an
ipa
scotch
ale
and
brown
ale
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
the
price
is
high
but
it
is
worth
it
this
is
my
first
dogfish
brew
i
am
now
interested
in
trying
more
this
brown
ale
pours
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
coffee
head
it
looks
like
a
stout
or
porter
the
smell
is
of
coffee
and
caramel
and
malt
and
hops
really
great
smell
the
taste
is
the
same
it
coats
the
tongue
in
brown
sugar
and
malt
and
coffee
is
this
a
coffee
stout
or
a
brown
ale
the
taste
is
great
its
coffeemalt
forward
with
a
nice
hop
finish
this
is
one
great
brown
ale
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
a
scottish
ale
mixed
with
a
light
stout
its
dark
and
delicious
d
great
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
i
think
dfh
brews
are
typically
overrated
this
one
is
possibly
the
worst
iver
personally
had
ive
only
ever
had
2
of
their
beers
i
liked
and
those
were
only
moderately
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
caramel
brown
with
a
2
finger
whit
head
it
has
lots
of
stayi9ng
power
and
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
dark
malty
goodness
lots
of
dark
coffee
notes
the
flavor
profile
is
sweet
coffee
notes
and
cocoa
nibs
the
brew
has
a
pleasant
bitternes
in
the
finish
it
is
medium
bodied
and
it
feels
a
bit
fuller
due
to
a
creamy
mouthfeel
simply
a
wonderful
brown
ale
md
smooth
and
silky
the
drinkability
is
goodyet
another
massproduced
but
still
unique
beverage
from
dfh
brewery
its
beers
like
thishardly
mentioned
even
in
discussions
specifically
about
dfh
that
solidify
in
my
mind
that
this
brewery
really
is
on
top
of
this
game
though
i
wont
follow
this
one
with
another
of
its
kind
id
like
to
keep
this
one
around
so
as
to
always
be
able
to
enjoy
it
best
drunk
in
twos
as
a
meal
and
a
nibble
of
dark
chocolate
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
nicely
balanced
and
one
ill
probably
revisit
again
for
how
this
beer
is
its
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
this
is
my
first
high
abv
browny
and
its
dope
d
wonderful
brown
ale
almost
a
mixture
of
an
ipa
and
a
brown
ale
but
not
overly
hopped
with
a
smooth
malty
coffee
taste
of
a
brown
ale
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
high
to
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
and
its
hard
to
notice
notes
i
dont
know
what
i
should
review
this
as
its
hardly
a
brown
its
as
much
a
brown
as
it
is
a
porter
a
strong
ale
an
ipa
a
scotch
ale
i
guess
it
looks
brown
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
smooth
as
velvet
creamy
with
a
medium
body
carbonation
is
light
in
this
one
overall
this
is
one
tasty
little
brew
the
abv
is
a
little
high
for
what
i
would
consider
a
session
brew
complex
and
yummy
this
is
one
i
will
be
recommending
to
my
friends
poured
into
pint
glass
dark
brown
with
a
nice
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
nice
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
sweetness
theres
also
a
strong
note
of
alcohol
but
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
other
scents
the
taste
is
fantastic
for
a
brown
in
fact
i
thought
i
was
having
a
porter
which
it
would
be
a
nice
porter
but
its
a
fantastic
brown
the
mouthfeel
is
has
the
same
hint
of
alcohol
that
the
scent
gave
off
which
does
take
a
little
away
from
the
experience
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
brown
ale
the
drinkability
was
good
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
more
than
two
at
a
time
d
because
of
its
experimental
nature
and
flavors
its
drinkability
is
affected
the
blend
of
styles
makes
it
a
once
and
a
while
beer
but
certainly
a
good
one
you
shouldnt
miss
notes
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
bottled
on
102008
a
very
nice
session
beer
and
one
that
i
would
seek
again
the
drinkability
is
wonderful
the
7
2
is
well
hidden
and
this
one
goes
down
smoothly
an
interesting
beer
from
an
interesting
brewery
pretty
solid
stuff
the
color
is
a
deep
dark
brown
that
leaves
a
pillowy
brown
head
and
some
very
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
brown
sugar
and
molasses
with
some
malt
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
more
malt
with
a
nice
range
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
molasses
nut
and
toasty
sugars
that
arent
too
sweet
hops
add
some
herbal
flavors
along
with
a
nice
balancing
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
thick
with
a
medium
to
full
body
the
finish
is
thick
with
toasted
malt
and
molasses
lingering
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
pretty
good
hampered
a
little
by
the
thickness
and
the
headiness
plus
a
fairly
high
abv
a
very
nice
complex
and
flavorful
brew
well
worth
trying
poured
into
a
normal
pint
glass
this
beer
produced
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
espresso
colored
head
the
smell
is
hops
sugar
and
malts
the
bottle
that
i
was
trying
was
from
0808
and
you
could
tell
that
the
hops
had
faded
regardless
the
malt
presence
was
very
nice
and
made
this
beer
very
good
i
would
recommend
anyone
try
this
beer
as
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
indian
brown
ales
although
good
sometimes
browns
can
get
boring
well
this
beer
says
hoof
to
that
big
time
if
youre
about
to
give
up
on
browns
dont
and
give
this
a
try
darker
brown
with
a
fluffy
head
fruity
malt
laced
aroma
and
whiffs
of
robustness
popping
from
the
depths
strong
full
bodied
taste
a
bitterness
coming
from
the
darker
roasted
elements
with
caramel
tones
which
are
somewhat
drowned
out
by
the
dark
roast
almost
like
a
stout
but
not
a
think
or
bitter
but
tending
in
that
direction
perfect
for
the
true
beer
lover
and
can
go
with
almost
any
occasion
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
inch
of
head
beautiful
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
red
i
love
the
smell
coffee
chocolate
earthy
smells
i
was
hesitant
to
taste
for
fear
of
disappointment
but
was
far
from
disappointed
it
has
a
nice
coffee
taste
with
some
chocolate
very
smooth
i
am
impressed
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
selection
pours
a
lightish
brown
colored
body
very
clear
looking
with
a
foamy
offwhite
colored
head
creamy
lasting
grapefruity
nutty
aroma
grapefruity
dusty
somewhat
nutty
aroma
nutty
taste
some

somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
okay
while
i
probably
wouldnt
call
agree
with
its
categorization
i
have
no
idea
what
to
call
it
dogfish
head
indian
brown
is
a
big
rich
complex
brown
ale
i
love
barley
and
this
brew
puts
it
out
there
in
a
strong
and
complex
way
other
prominent
flavors
give
it
an
interesting
profile
and
every
facet
of
it
seems
to
be
well
crafted
this
is
a
beer
i
will
certainly
purchase
regularly
and
drink
at
their
pub
drinkability
is
high
a
great
brew
best
brown
ale
ive
had
drinkability
is
excellent
a
well
put
together
beer
than
seems
very
out
of
the
ordinary
to
me
but
something
that
i
seem
to
always
expect
with
dfh
beers
i
find
dfh
to
be
hit
or
miss
and
this
regular
offering
is
a
huge
hit
just
terrific
wow
if
you
think
most
brown
ales
are
boring
you
need
to
try
this
one
its
hoppy
than
most
browns
but
not
overdone
and
i
like
the
decision
to
not
use
citrus
hops
the
libertygolding
combo
works
very
well
almost
black
brew
with
dark
cream
head
it
has
a
nice
aroma
of
roast
brown
sugar
hops
hint
of
alcohol
some
earthy
cocoa
undertones
the
balance
jumps
out
at
ya
hops
and
malt
flawlessly
opposite
like
yin
and
yang
roast
real
brown
sugar
no
synthetics
here
hops
toward
the
finish
to
swipe
the
malt
out
of
the
mouth
and
get
you
ready
for
your
next
swig
light
grape
notes
and
subtle
cocoa
great
lightmedium
body
with
a
slick
finish
high
drinkability
holds
hands
with
pretty
high
abv
while
skipping
through
any
season
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
this
is
a
very
toasty
brew
very
prominent
toasted
characteristics
are
the
focus
of
this
brew
im
not
quite
a
brown
a
brown
ale
guy
but
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
this
style
deep
brown
color
with
a
great
foamy
head
lacing
down
the
sides
stayed
around
for
a
while
mouthfeel
was
damn
near
perfect
strong
aftertaste
that
would
probably
go
good
with
toasted
marshmallows
this
poured
into
my
pint
glass
darker
than
most
brown
ales
ive
sampled
also
slight
red
hues
were
noticeable
the
smell
was
of
malty
caramel
i
didnt
really
get
the
chocolate
taste
that
ive
read
in
other
reviews
i
found
the
alcohol
to
be
conpletely
hidden
i
did
get
the
coffee
hints
and
the
silky
smooth
swallow
ill
be
seeing
more
of
this
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
was
stale
or
what
but
i
found
it
just
didnt
have
any
pop
as
far
as
flavor
considering
the
reviews
not
bad
but
not
particularly
noteworthy
for
me
didnt
really
increase
flavors
as
it
warmed
up
either
im
not
normally
overly
fond
of
hoppy
browns
but
dfh
indian
brown
has
the
balance
down
on
this
one
one
bottle
with
dinner
was
not
enough
for
me
and
i
currently
feel
stupid
for
not
buying
more
tasty
as
the
beer
warmed
the
alcohol
was
more
prevalent
but
never
overpowering
drinkability
a
delicious
beer
and
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
this
one
is
great
with
hamburgers
and
for
after
the
meal
as
well
d
id
disappointed
that
i
never
tapped
into
this
one
before
the
complexity
is
remarkable
a
nice
scotch
ale
screw
the
brown
ale
appelation
single
from
trader
joes
newport
news
va
dated

overall
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
body
and
some
carbonation
the
finish
is
light
and
lingers
for
a
moment
this
beer
encompasses
a
whole
range
of
flavor
in
a
nice
uniform
flavors
this
american
brown
ale
is
rather
refreshing
and
there
is
a
nice
hop
notes
in
the
brew
it
is
a
well
rounded
beer
that
can
grab
your
attention
i
enjoyed
this
brew
it
is
well
made
thank
you
for
this
beer
d
great
little
twist
on
a
classic
style
i
would
say
this
ranks
up
with
the
greatest
of
session
beers
but
no
matter
what
you
mouth
says
this
guy
is
above
7
if
you
havnt
had
yet
youre
missing
out
overall
a
good
brown
this
is
what
newcastle
wants
to
be
when
it
grows
up
d
not
sessionable
but
i
would
go
for
a
few
as
the
taste
is
impressive
one
of
my
favorite
dfh
offerings
i
could
drink
this
year
round
and
have
i
dont
go
for
american
brown
ales
often
as
most
offerings
are
butchered
but
this
one
stands
above
them
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
medium
bodied
seems
more
like
a
combination
of
a
dry
porter
and
a
brown
than
anything
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
take
on
the
style
nice
and
thick
smooth
and
silky
in
the
mouth
quite
satisfying
in
taste
i
picked
up
nutty
toasty
and
bitter
malt
somewhat
syrupy
in
the
finish
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
has
resparked
my
interest
d
i
kept
taking
sips
of
this
in
rapid
succession
to
taste
the
complexity
dfh
has
done
a
great
job
with
this
beer
and
i
would
drink
a
few
more
if
i
had
them
overall
as
with
everything
i
have
ever
had
from
dfh
this
beer
was
great
i
would
drink
it
again
and
again
overall
this
beer
is
delicious
itll
drive
the
malt
fans
crazy
like
me
but
the
name
indian
brown
ale
might
confuse
some
people
thinking
its
a
brown
ipa
or
something
i
think
its
definitely
more
brown
ale
than
indian
brown
ale
but
i
dont
really
care
what
they
call
it
its
delicious
d
quite
drinkable
hides
its
7
2
abv
quite
well
the
complex
flavors
play
well
together
with
nothing
dominating
its
on
a
bit
of
the
extreme
end
of
the
american
brown
ale
but
within
the
style
d
ok
id
probably
drink
two
or
three
of
these
it
is
a
tasty
beer
lots
of
interesting
things
going
on
ive
really
enjoyed
it
i
can
see
the
comparison
of
a
brown
ale
and
an
ipa
i
dont
quite
get
the
scottish
ale
though
id
recommend
it
to
anybody
that
likes
ipas
though
good
drinkability
lots
of
sweetness
but
that
makes
it
light
and
refreshing
which
is
good
for
drinking
multiples
over
all
a
good
beer
and
always
dfhs
higher
abv
d
oh
yeah
its
a
nice
range
in
abv
and
it
is
cold
outside
for
several
more
months
side
from
the
fact
that
the
tangyness
may
start
to
overstay
its
welcome
in
the
back
of
your
throat
after
a
few
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
while
still
delivering
a
pleasant
warming
feeling
all
in
all
a
really
nice
beer
that
i
wish
were
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
a
highly
recommended
beer
for
dinner
or
afterwards
always
something
good
from
sam
the
madman
of
milton
delaware
d
very
drinkable
from
a
flavor
perspective
but
the
abv
and
richness
keeps
it
from
being
a
true
session
ale
very
nice
beer
that
ill
be
having
again
soon
indian
brown
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
from
dogfish
pours
an
earthy
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
has
sweet
candy
malts
and
piney
hops
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
great
balance
body
matches
style
perfectly
a
good
drinker
from
our
friend
sam
at
dfh
liberty
and
goldings
hops
d
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
you
get
all
sorts
of
flavors
its
a
part
on
your
palate
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
a
very
deep
dark
mahogony
with
notes
of
ruby
a
nice
crowning
eggshell
colored
head
nice
aroma
of
hops
chocolate
and
coffee
the
first
sip
confirms
the
coffee
and
nice
creamy
rich
chocolatey
malt
its
a
sweet
combo
that
really
works
well
with
the
hops
this
is
the
only
brown
with
any
real
hop
flavor
that
i
have
had
to
date
this
beer
has
a
thickness
not
normally
associated
with
a
brown
that
isnt
a
nutbrown
that
thickness
however
does
not
stop
this
from
being
a
very
easy
drinking
brown
over
all
very
drinkable
highly
flavorful
beer
great
balance
of
malts
hops
and
smoky
coffee
flavors
my
favorite
brown
ale
d
certainly
would
enjoy
one
but
more
than
that
would
probably
destroy
my
palate
a
bit
more
balance
between
the
bitter
and
sweet
would
help
here
deep
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
fine
mocha
collar
of
foam
that
leaves
fine
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
the
caramelized
brown
sugar
on
the
label
and
nice
roasty
malts
coffee
mint
and
a
nice
herbal
hop
aroma
blend
nicely
tastes
hoppier
and
more
intense
than
most
brown
ales
nice
sweet
roasty
malt
with
a
floral
hop
flavor
that
follows
finishes
with
a
good
coffeechicory
mild
bitterness
medium
silky
mouthfeel
with
fine
crisp
carbonation
one
of
my
faves
never
disappoints
a
gem
another
great
beer
from
the
boys
in
dover
well
worth
the
wait
d
very
interesting
blend
of
styles
here
the
result
of
which
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
abv
highly
recommended
d
crowned
my
new
favorite
brown
ale
this
beer
is
great
i
cant
wait
for
the
day
dfh
is
distributed
in
la
had
this
through
my
work
beer
exchange
definitely
a
strong
beer
thats
not
very
sessionable
it
had
a
bit
of
a
scotch
ale
feel
to
it
it
reminded
me
of
a
cross
between
newcastle
and
mcewans
scotch
ale
nice
sweet
start
with
a
smooth
malty
finish
great
winter
beer
d
so
the
seemingly
simple
rich
brown
sugary
qualities
of
the
brown
ale
have
been
very
well
fused
with
the
bite
of
a
more
hoppy
brew
i
like
this
very
much
and
even
though
this
is
a
dense
beer
i
confess
being
able
to
put
away
a
fare
few
quite
easily
on
a
cool
winter
day
d
really
drinkable
boozy
finish
great
for
a
colder
day
very
dark
brown
in
color
but
not
black
an
orange
tinge
at
the
rims
underscores
the
clarity
of
the
liquid
average
to
thin
depth
of
head
yet
leaves
a
full
attractive
lacing
behind
brown
sugar
toffee
black
raisin
plum
licorice
chocolate
in
the
nose
obviously
more
malts
than
hops
fat
enough
to
settle
in
fully
and
stay
until
closing
time
fullbodied
all
roasty
and
toasty
with
sweet
malt
segueing
into
dark
chocolate
powder
coffee
brown
sugar
offers
golden
and
black
raisins
figs
and
dates
more
than
any
fresh
fruit
flavors
however
not
saccharine
carbonation
and
hops
ride
in
just
in
time
to
lead
into
a
cleaner
finish
than
expected
arguably
trying
to
do
too
much
still
tasty
enough
12oz
bottle
purchased
at
the
local
hannaford
pours
a
translucent
dark
brown
body
with
a
thin
film
of
light
tan
head
aroma
consists
equally
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
and
citrussy
hops
tastes
like
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
good
portion
of
citrussy
hops
to
balance
it
out
better
than
many
browns
no
alcohol
flavor
but
a
hint
of
viscosity
and
warming
along
with
moderate
carbonation
somewhat
of
a
sipper
though
goes
down
easier
than
some
beers
with
this
abv
and
flavor
wow
this
is
a
lot
better
than
i
remember
it
being
a
new
favorite
american
brown
poured
into
bubble
pint
glass
poured
with
almost
no
head
what
head
there
was
had
very
good
retention
below
average
lacing
for
a
brew
this
type
a
rich
deep
mahogany
that
allows
just
a
little
light
to
poke
through
a
very
sweet
aroma
greets
you
immediately
not
just
the
usual
malt
sweetness
that
would
be
expected
but
a
sugary
blast
that
caught
me
offguard
the
flavor
was
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
led
me
to
expect
very
nice
roasty
flavors
although
the
slight
coffee
flavor
put
me
off
a
little
the
flavors
stick
to
the
tongue
but
fade
before
becoming
annoying
thus
letting
you
be
ready
for
the
next
sip
the
body
is
a
little
thin
a
fuller
more
wellrounded
mouthfeel
would
be
welcome
very
drinkable
although
a
bit
much
for
a
session
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
poured
a
deep
lifeless
brown
from
the
bottle
with
just
barely
enough
coffeecolored
head
to
cover
the
surface
of
the
beer
i
found
the
smell
to
be
this
brews
low
pointthe
slightly
malty
nutty
brown
ale
aromas
accompanied
by
a
strange
mustiness
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
however
especially
as
the
beer
warmed
was
everything
ive
been
seeking
in
a
brown
ale
again
the
typical
brown
ale
flavors
of
malt
and
nuttiness
were
upfront
while
a
solid
hoppiness
came
through
alongside
a
little
brown
sugar
in
the
backend
to
create
a
delicious
balance
immediately
following
was
this
beers
other
high
point
its
silkysmooth
mouthfeel
at
last
a
brown
ale
that
doesnt
finish
disappointingly
thin
given
the
balance
and
great
mouthfeel
drinkability
was
quite
good
overall
this
is
a
tremendous
take
on
the
style
deep
brown
with
a
big
dose
of
carbonation
creating
a
large
tan
head
aroma
of
caramel
cofee
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
hops
rich
candy
sugar
and
molases
dominate
the
palate
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
probably
an
excellent
example
of
a
style
of
which
i
am
just
not
a
big
fan
very
rich
sweet
and
filling
no
amount
of
hops
can
make
it
through
the
sugary
body
this
could
probably
be
matched
very
with
with
certain
specific
foods
but
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
consider
drinking
with
much
frequency
this
is
always
a
hit
with
me
complex
yet
drinkable
dark
yet
light
enough
to
have
a
couple
of
them
pours
a
rich
brown
with
a
thin
cappuccinolike
head
that
lingers
and
laces
throughout
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
hint
of
coffee
i
taste
a
lot
of
coffee
in
this
and
blind
tasted
it
might
be
guessed
to
contain
a
bit
of
coffee
burnt
sugar
and
lightly
roasted
malt
interesting
for
a
brown
ale
because
it
is
not
overly
roasted
and
the
added
sugars
for
the
higher
alcohol
stand
out
a
bit
more
the
hops
here
are
more
character
hops
rather
than
up
front
type
d
its
a
little
strong
and
boozy
but
still
quite
refreshing
my
best
brown
to
date
very
solid
beer
i
look
forward
to
more
of
this
dark
brown
colored
beer
with
a
rich
creamy
head
with
good
staying
power
aroma
is
coffee
taste
is
coffeesugar
and
dark
fruit
very
creamy
and
smooth
alcohol
is
well
hidden
although
i
doubt
i
could
drink
more
than
three
at
a
sitting
overall
very
good
highly
recommended
and
i
will
purchase
again
becoming
a
standby
in
my
collection
of
beverages
this
is
the
indian
brown
ale
to
beat
all
drinks
like
a
fine
wine
dont
have
too
many
due
to
the
high
abv
but
heytry
to
resist
i
would
call
this
my
goto
beverage
especially
in
the
winter
months
when
were
staring
at
the
thermometer
at
20
degrees
really
takes
off
the
edge
superb
and
highly
recommened
just
get
some
youll
see
drinkability
drinks
much
easier
than
the
7
2
would
suggest
the
tiniest
bite
from
the
hops
totally
adds
to
the
character
of
this
brew
this
is
one
of
my
favored
brown
ales
its
not
as
sweet
as
some
of
the
others
i
have
tried
picked
up
a
single
bottle
of
this
pours
a
dark
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
huge
light
tan
head
that
stays
around
for
a
long
while
leaving
behind
some
nice
lacing
aroma
has
a
nice
mixture
of
hoppiness
and
some
brown
sugar
mixed
with
some
sweet
toasty
malts
flavor
is
very
lovely
mix
of
coffee
and
bitter
hops
coffee
is
the
most
prominent
flavor
light
chocolate
in
the
middle
and
a
nice
bitter
hoppiness
at
the
finish
very
nicely
balanced
medium
bodied
average
carbonation
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
roasted
coffee
flavor
mixed
with
the
bright
hops
is
a
nice
twist
on
the
style
the
feel
was
smoothcreamy
with
medium
carbonation
and
really
good
balance
this
beer
is
really
a
good
choice
to
buy
as
a
sixer
you
really
do
not
feel
the
abv
at
all
d
feels
like
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
but
i
know
i
shouldnt
highly
recommended
for
brown
ale
lovers
wellcrafted
d
a
nice
creamy
beer
but
fills
you
up
this
is
one
to
have
with
dinner
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
get
a
sixer
of
and
to
drink
throught
the
weekend
this
beer
is
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
because
of
the
hop
content
and
the
carmalized
brown
sugar
that
makes
it
vey
unique
its
vey
sweet
in
the
aroma
but
very
hoppy
in
the
flavor
with
strong
notes
of
molasses
and
chocolate
a
little
boozy
though
a
very
good
unique
brown
ale
indeed
d
i
thought
this
was
fantastic
sadly
i
only
have
a
single
bottle
d
a
decent
brown
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
it
had
tons
of
malt
and
caramel
on
the
flavor
with
a
good
hop
kick
the
aroma
is
loaded
with
hops
and
malt
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
cold
day
and
with
food
the
color
is
a
dark
rich
brown
nice
head
with
great
lacing
enjoy
this
one
by
the
fire
mouthfeel
was
a
little
sweet
but
very
enjoyable
taste
is
bittersweet
chocolate
caramel
apples
coffee
and
roasted
nuts
leaves
the
mouth
dry
and
bitter
also
ends
a
little
sour
too
i
think
it
takes
a
lot
to
make
a
very
flavorful
beer
be
good
all
around
and
this
beer
does
it
for
me
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
always
loved
the
flavor
of
brown
ales
but
found
them
a
little
boring
and
too
little
co2
action
going
on
dfh
fixes
that
by
hopping
it
up
and
making
it
more
carbonated
making
for
a
delicious
beer
i
drank
the
whole
glass
in
under
5
minutes
not
even
on
purpose
it
just
tastes
too
good
to
savor
i
cant
wait
to
drink
the
other
5
three
thumbs
up
one
of
the
best
american
browns
out
there
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
beer
again
d
this
is
the
best
brown
ale
ive
tasted
its
big
balanced
and
very
appealing
ill
definitely
seek
this
out
again
in
the
future
d
i
wasnt
that
impressed
with
this
right
out
of
the
gate
but
it
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
the
end
result
for
me
was
an
very
nice
experience
definitely
worth
a
revisit
down
the
road
d
pretty
heavy
and
robust
somewhat
complex
but
still
goes
down
really
easy
smells
sweet
sugary
strong
chocolate
toasted
coffee
brown
sugar
malt
taste
with
a
background

extremely
complex
ale
here
lots
of
taste
well
balanced
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
brown
ales
because
they
tend
to
be
watery
but
this
was
actually
pretty
thick
this
is
what
all
other
brown
ales
should
aspire
to
dark
brown
opaque
beer
little
light
getting
through
with
a
good
inch
of
light
tan
head
that
lasts
and
leave
lots
of
lace
smells
sweet
like
molasses
and
chocolate
and
a
little
coffee
a
sweet
malty
start
with
a
litle
bit
of
hop
and
cholocolate
bitterness
towards
the
finish
this
is
a
big
brown
weighing
in
at
7
20
but
the
alcohol
ishidden
well
this
is
my
favorite
brown
to
date
fullbodied
and
creamy
for
the
style
but
that
only
adds
to
my
pleasure
d
not
a
beer
for
everyone
if
you
like
imperial
stouts
you
will
love
this
one
it
is
a
heavier
beer
so
not
one
for
mass
consumption
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had

beer
is

another

beer
from
dfh
definitely
worth
a
try
they
blur
the
lines

with

thats

i
like
it
and
the
high

is
nice
that

however
does
not
stop
this
from
being
a
very
easy
drinking
brown
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
creamy
off
white
head
not
much
head
retention
the
smell
is
of
caramel

the

taste
is
of

chocolate
sweetness
which
are
then
offset
by
hops

the
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
and
goes
down

this
is
a
great
beer

sit
down

for
an
evening
pleasantly
surprising
beer
that
is
more
mellow
than
the
average

great

d
wonderful
one

the
best

if
not
the

thanks
to
curtdoggyo
for
the
tasting
sponsorship
from
our
homebrew
session
drinkability
do
you
like
robust
and
delicous
brown
ales
that
are
full
flavored
if
you
do
this
is
a
beer
for
you
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
in
the
brown
ale
category
and
overall
i
really
think
this
is
the
unsung
hero
of
the
dogfish
line
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
darn
near
black
in
color
with
ruby
hints
at
the
edges
and
maybe
a
finger
of
khaki
colored
head
when
held
to
the
light
this
beer
is
quite
clear
and
a
dark
reddishbrown
looks
great
but
too
dark
for
the
style
aroma
is
quiet
nice
malty
and
sweet
at
first
it
seems
to
be
fairly
roasty
but
this
soon
gives
way
to
more
chocolate
and
caramel
aromas
with
a
touch
of
fruityness
and
maybe
just
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
very
good
i
again
find
some
roasted
notes
that
seem
out
of
place
in
a
brown
ale
more
chocolate
and
caramel
as
well
as
a
bit
of
toast
medium
hop
bitterness
and
a
pleasant
hop
flavor
not
american
hops
as
one
would
expect
here
but
more
of
a
nobleesque
hop
flavor
the
bottle
states
that
liberty
and
goldings
hops
are
an
ingredient
and
if
i
recall
correctly
liberty
is
a
us
grown
hallertau
derivative
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
relatively
dry
finish
with
some
mere
indications

the
respectable
7
2
abv
drinkability
is
excellent
this
beer
seemed
to
be
more
of
a
porter
at
times
but
was
immensely
enjoyable
if
i
rated
strictly
to
style
it
wouldnt
have
fared
quite
as
well
but
given
dfhs
penchant
for
innovation
i
drank
this
with
an
open
mind
the
abv
is
too
high
to
be
a
session
beer
but
i
think
this
makes
a
pretty
good
everyday
drinker
this
is
a
full
flavored
full
bodied
great
tasting
beer
takes
the
brown
ale
to
a
new
level
easy
and
quite
fun
to
drink
this
is
pretty
close
to
br
tribute
brown
as
my
favorite
brown
ales
of
all
time
it
is
thick
and
packs
a
bit
of
a
punch
which
takes
away
a
little
from
its
drinkability
but
for
me
i
could
easily
find
room
for
one
more
this
is
a
must
have
drinkability
very
low
for
dogfish
standards
overall
an
interesting
beer
a
bit
to
hoppy
for
me
to
really
get
into
it
though
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
but
i
would
definitely
have
again
d
kind
of
porterish
dark
tasting
with
good
toast
and
some
acidity
but
with
a
strong
bitter
finish
drinkability
is
great
for

apv
this
brew
is
smooth
and
mellow
on
the
palate
without
coming
off

or
overly
heavy
on
the
palate
a
wonderfully
warming
brown
ale
with
malt
depth
and
hop
bitterness
cheers
o
sam
meets
my
needs
grab
it
i
gotta
say
that
i
expected
more
hops
from
this
one
judging
by
the
description
but
its
still
pretty
impressive
for
a
7
2
the
malt
flavors
are
the
strong
side
here
almost
covering
up
the
hops
altogether
in
summary
its
like
a
chuck
norris
roundhouse
kick
to
the
face
carbonation
is
on
the
light
side
but
its
so
dark
i
dont
know
that
id
want
to
drink
more
than
1
im
not
a
huge
coffee
fan
enjoyable
but
i
dont
think
ill
drink
two
in
a
row
well
at
this
age
it
is
still
pretty
damn
good
wish
i
had
a
fresh
one
to
compare
but
i
havent
seen
it
around
in
ages
its
been
almost
a
year
since
i
had
this
stuff
and
i
remember
it
being
sweeter
but
who
knows
since
my
palate
wasnt
really
well
trained
and
i
was
still
drinking
directly
from
the
bottle
a
decent
brown
ale
and
very
unique
dogfish
head
does
some
nice
things
this
is
one
of
them
though
it
is
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
though
this
is
something
i
would
recommend
if
you
want
something
different
taste
full
mouth
feel
is
smooth
almost
creamy
sweet
slight
alcohol
taste
with
roasted
caramel
flavors
balanced
nicely
by
hops
for
the
perfect
bitterness
this
is
a
big
complex
bier
that
i
cant
wait
to
drink
again
d
a
great
brown
ale
i
couldnt
decide
if
i
wanted
to
drink
a
brown
or
an
ipa
this
one
gave
me
both
very
easy
to
drink
several
recommended
this
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
quickly
disappears
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
chocolate
and
malts
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
chocolate
and
malts
the
higher
alcohol
content
is
well
hidden
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
body
and
a
little
syrupy
drinkability
is
hindered
a
bit
by
the
higher
abv
and
syrupy
taste
overall
an
exellent
beer
that
i
will
purchase
again
d
good
for
year
round
consumption
and
would
be
tasty
with
grilled
ribs
burgers
or
on
its
own
taste
the
beer
tasted
of
coffee
toffee
and
chocolate
the
hops
werent
as
strong
as
i
was
expecting
from
a
beer
with
india
in
the
name
of
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
bold
taste
and
rich
mouthfeel
the
abv
is
the
only
limiting
factor
a
nice
brown
ale
or
imperial
porter
d
the
bitterness
drops
the
drinkability
of
this
one
for
me
dark
cloudy
brown
color
pours
a
thick
tan
head
smells
of
crazy
malts
tastes
like
coffee
lots
of
coffee
huge
caramel
flavor
and
a
nice
blend
of
malts
brings
it
together
it
finishes
with
a
small
hop
spice
but
is
smoothed
out
and
doesnt
do
any
harm
a
nice
thick
smooth
brown
ale
that
goes
down
easy
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
try
it
d
decent
enough
but
not
quite
what
im
looking
for
a
quality
brew
for
sure
but
the
sweetness
is
overrun
by
roasted
malt
and
the
hops
dont
mesh
as
well
with
the
brown
ale
flavors
as
i
would
prefer
a
good
beer
nonetheless
d
way
easy
to
get
drunk
i
can
drink
these
without
food
and
be
pleased
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
and
refreshing
in
a
way
drinkability
is
is
good
however
lots
of
big
flavors
and
relatively
high
alc
content
make
this
less
than
suitable
for
a
session
always
a
staple
the
indian
brown
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
light
brown
head
that
retains
well
smells
of
sweet
roastiness
coffee
caramel
grassy
hops
earthiness
taste
follows
suit
with
more
roasty
flavors
coffee
molasses
balanced
out
with
grassy
hops
and
good
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
earthy
beer
mouthfeel
has
a
good
body
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
moderately
dry
yet
crisp
finish
highly
drinkable
but
will
kick
your
ass
if
you
dont
watch
out
very
good
beer
i
wanted
to
have
this
side
by
side
with
terrapins
iba
but
it
wasnt
available
at
that
bar
drinkability
suffers
a
little
from
the
bittersweet
taste
i
could
drink
1
or
2
easily
but
more
than
that
and
i
start
to
get
afraid
of
a
stomach
ache
just
like
eating
too
much
candy
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
pretty
interesting
combo
of
several
styles
of
brew
not
a
great
session
beer
in
my
mind
due
to
its
very
dark
and
chewy
character
i
do
like
this
beer
a
lot
just
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
overall
a
really
solid
beer
from
dfh
i
find
most
of
their
beers
to
be
overhyped
but
this
one
lives
up
to
it
highly
recommend
could
see
getting
this
even
once
in
awhile
as
a
good
changeup
or
on
tap
if
i
can
find
it
notes
i
am
suprised
based
on
the
title
of
the
beer
alone
i
thought
that
it
would
either
be
a
moderate
brown
ale
or
possibly
even
have
a
hoppy
taste
it
really
just
tastes
like
a
porter
or
stout
a
good
porter
or
stout
though
d

a

high
in

and
heavy
mouthfeel
7282005
something
ive
been
thinking
about
trying
for
a
while
finally
bought
a
sixer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
moderate
tan
head
and
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
smoky
malty
nutty
but
nothing
too
exciting
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
slightly
sweet
with
a
roasted
malt
flavor
and
some
coffee
very
little
bitterness
im
not
really
sure
why
they
call
it
india
and
advertise
it
as
hoppy
because
i
really
didnt
taste
a
whole
lot
of
hops
still
its
a
solid
beer
and
they
hide
the
7
2
abv
quite
well
truly
a
great
beer
strong
flavor
profile
if
the
alcohol
was
lower
would
be
great
to
session
also
not
as
heavy
as
i
mightve
imagined
and
alcohol
taste
is
mostly
well
hidden
but
i
think
there
was
a
bit
too
much
going
on
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
yum
a
great
aroma
of
caramelyhinted
malt
pervades
as
i
pour
this
woodstain
colored
ale
not
much
head
but
its
fades
to
a
nice
ring
that
clings
to
the
glass
little
lacing
very
very
tasty
for
7

alc
chocolate
coffee
like
a
stout
balanced
hops
and
malt
delicate
carbonation
mediumheavy
body
and
a
smooth
finish
all
make
this
a
quaffable
brew
a
great
brew
for
novices
and
sybarites
alike
share
this
with
you
friends
tell
em
kevlar
told
you
to
this
beer
pours
a
sturdy
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
a
firm
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
molasses
brown
sugar
and
hints
of
chocolate
the
taste
has
the
malty
goodness
of
the
aroma
with
the
addition
of
the
green
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
too
hoppy
of
a
brown
ale
for
my
liking
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
however
and
i
could
drink
it
again
i
will
certainly
be
getting
this
again
and
again
overall
this
is
a
very
flavorful
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone
dogfish
head
indian
brown
ale
is
my
idea
of
a
quality
brew
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
dogfish
head
beer
this
beer
features
a
solid
balance
of
roasted
malt
and
full
flavored
hops
with
serious
coffee
and
dark
fruit
tones
this
went
down
smooth
and
surprisingly
refreshing
d
this
is
my
first
time
with
this
particular
beer
but
it
reminds
me
why
i
picked
brown
ale
for
my
first
home
brewing
recipe
its
like
looking
at
an
old
photo
album
with
you
grandparents
when
all
the
photos
have
turned
with
sepia
every
page
is
some
exciting
story
you
didnt
know
existed
until
you
heard
them
this
brown
ale
is
a
return
to
a
simpler
time
but
finding
that
something
you
thought
you
knew
complete
had
a
whole
nother
side
you
could
have
even
contemplated
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
one
that
i
will
probably
revisit
quite
different
from
the
nut
brown
ale
style
and
far
more
interesting
than
those
typically
the
hefty
malt
is
needed
to
keep
the
hops
from
getting
out
of
hand
this
is
hardly
sessionable
i
would
top
out
at
two
the
alcohol
plays
a
role
in
this
but
i
felt
it
more
than
tasted
it
the
brown
sugar
starts
to
get
cloying
after
a
while
too
still
an
impressive
beer
worth
trying
at
least
once
and
probably
more
a
very
strong
effort
by
dfh
still
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
can
readily
see
how
this
beer
can
be
the
hop
heads
brown
ale
md
full
bodied
and
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
drinking
not
sure
if
this
really
falls
into
the
realm
of
brown
ale
but
whatever
it
is
it
is
damn
tasty
d
this
is
a
damn
smooth
brown
ale
this
beer
has
a
great
chocolate
coloring
slightly
fizzy
as
well
the
smell
is
full
of
a
malty
molasses
air
the
color
is
representative
of
the
slightly
mocha
taste
there
is
also
a
hint
of
nutmeg
great
light
feel
on
the
tongue
surprising
for
such
a
dark
brew
good
drinkability
and
it
packs
a
pretty
decent
alcohol
punch
the
taste
is
very
close
to
a
scotch
ale
while
still
staying
near
the
brown
ale
label
no
matter
what
you
call
it
damn
it
tastes
good
if
i
were
drinking
this
in
a
dark
tavern
i
would
have
thought
it
superb
the
flavor
is
very
nice
with
a
bit
of
smokiness
on
the
palate
and
a
rather
bold
finish
but
without
being
too
heavy
it
drinks
a
bit
like
a
scottish
brown
ale
the
nose
is
a
bit
weak
but
has
a
subtle
maltiness
but
sitting
in
the
sunlight
the
color
is
a
bit
dull
it
is
too
dark
to
show
off
its
effervescent
carbonation
and
there
is
practically
no
head
overall
a
good
solid
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
a
bit
out
of
the
ordinary
poured
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
the
aroma
was
coffee
with
a
hint
of
malts
the
taste
was
odd
bitter
like
a
cup
of
cold
coffee
after
a
couple
tastes
i
kept
thinking
of
burnt
sugar
it
wasnt
a
turnoff
but
i
didnt
really
enjoy
the
flavor
it
has
good
texture
it
is
on
the
heavy
side
but
if
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
i
could
see
drinking
a
six
pack
with
no
problem
pours
a
dark
blackish
brown
with
hues
of
amber
on
the
edges
standard
14
off
white
head
that
settles
to
a
fine
layer
within
a
minute
smells
of
rich
malty
carmelly
hoppy
goodness
thats
the
easiest
way
for
me
to
put
it
nice
roasted
caramel
malts
greet
the
tongue
upon
swallowing
the
taste
transitions
to
an
earthy
piney
hoppiness
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
silky
mouth
feel
the
burntness
of
the
grains
mingles
well
with
the
tingling
of
the
hops
a
very
well
structured
beer
i
approve
pours
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
edges
no
head
on
the
pour
only
a
slight
froth
around
the
perimeter
of
the
glass
smell
is
dark
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
piney
hops
wow
there
is
a
lot
more
coffee
in
this
brown
than
i
was
ever
expecting
caught
me
off
guard
this
is
a
very
good
brown
ale
full
and
roasty
on
the
mouthfeel
theres
just
a
bit
of
a
harsh
roasted
coffee
aftertaste
other
than
that
this
is
a
winner
this
is
very
drinkable
not
extremely
special
but
tasty
nonetheless
browns
are
usually
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
usually
the
problem
is
that
the
malt
profile
is
off
for
one
and
then
its
also
usually
not
balanced
in
the
least
well
dogfish
have
gone
and
made
a
strong
supremely
drinkable
brown
thats
almost
perfectly
balanced
kudos
good
one
very
much
overly
malty
with
more
coffee
flavor
and
aroma
then
i
wanted
i
was
hoping
for
more
but
got
average
this
brew
get
way
better
as
it
warms
up
d
a
good
attempt
but
really
didnt
care
to
much
for
this
on
a
personal
level
a
moderately
good
drink
none
the
less
but
combining
the
two
only
diminished
and
muddled
a
potentially
good
brown
this
would
be
a
nice
one
to
have
on
hand
for
the
full
flavor
of
a
stout
but
in
a
little
smoother
more
drinkable
brew
this
is
a
great
beer
dogfish
head
continues
to
impress
its
on
the
heavy
side
and
has
a
higher
alcohol
content
which
brings
down
its
drinkability
its
pretty
well
rounded
looks
great
smells
amazing
and
the
taste
matches
the
aroma
would
definitely
get
again
very
drinkable
and
wellbalanced
could
be
a
little
drier
would
benefit
from
additional
hop
character
or
dropping
the
i
from
iba
good
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
medium
on
the
palate
lower
levels
of
carbonation
definitely
a
drying
sensation
in
the
finsih
this
is
a
beer
that
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
more
than
three
of
in
a
single
sitting
great
beer
however
well
i
guess
i
could
easily
relax
and
drink
more
than
three
of
these
in
a
sitting
that
is
considering
that
im
not
trying
to
get
drunk
and
am
enjoying
them
over
a
prolonged
amount
of
time
this
is
one
im
sure
ill
see
myself
buying
again
but
first
more
beer
to
explore
really
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
definitely
recommended
serving
type
bottle
in
my
opinion
this
beer
tastes
the
way
newcastle
should
taste
everything
you
could
want
in
a
solid
brown
alearoma
mouthfilling
fllavor
and
great
drinkability
make
for
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
i
think
this
could
be
a
contender
for
a
place
in
valhala
d
d
is
for
dangerous
at
7
its
a
bit
strong
and
its
masked
so
well
its
rediculous
i
could
drink
these
all
night
notes
got
this
one
from
dyan
thanks
this
is
a
beer
ive
been
wanting
to
try
for
quite
some
time
im
happy
to
say
that
it
exceeded
my
expectations
mfd
mediumfull
bodied
ale
not
as
good
as
id
hoped
it
would
be
but
its
worth
checking
out
overall
a
great
and
incredible
beer
with
great
flavor
great
balance
and
great
finish
just
fantastic
mouthfeel
is
full
robust
drinkability
suffers
from
the
wet
towel
aftertaste
im
a
big
fan
of
dogfish
but
this
ones
just
ok
d
indian
brown
ale
is
a
rich
powerful
and
enjoyable
brown
ale
its
remarkably
complex
and
bold
flavored
coupled
with
the
impressively
smooth
mouthfeel
make
for
a
wonderful
drinkable
experience
the
only
two
things
limiting
drinkability
for
this
beer
are
the
higher
than
average
abv
and
the
full
body
definitely
not
a
quaffer
but
one
to
be
savored
d
abv
is
a
little
high
but
it
tastes
really
good
this
makes
me
like
to
drink
it
good
smooth
mouthfeel
and
pretty
nice
body
in
this
brownie
i
like
it
a
lot
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
looking
to
venture
out
but
this
is
really
a
god
example
of
the
style
d
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
an
excellent
wellrounded
taste
which
was
complimented
very
nicely
by
the
mouthfeel
definitely
a
nice
brown
ale
overall
and
recommended
a
go
if
the
chance
arises
very
good
beer
i
think
this
can
be
a
rather
confusing
beer
as
dogfish
is
definitely
trying
to
bring
together
the
best
of
two
worlds
that
being
an
ipa
and
nut
brown
ale
by
default
you
may
be
tempted
to
judge
it
against
other
brown
ales
because
of
the
color
and
head
when
you
pour
it
but
since
that
wasnt
the
brewerys
intention
thatd
be
a
bit
foolish
my
instinct
is
that
the
beer
itself
is
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
for
a
brown
ale
but
for
intents
and
purposes
they
did
a
fine
job
of
bringing
that
aspect
of
the
ipa
together
well
with
complexity
of
the
malts
of
a
brown
ale
the
hops
arent
overwhelming
by
any
stretch
and
you
get
a
healthy
dose
of
almost
coffee
like
maltness
in
the
aftertaste
a
good
beer
but
definitely
not
one
that
id
try
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
in
one
sitting
probably
would
go
really
well
with
a
huge
chunk
of
chocolate
cake
too
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
creamy
tan
head
interesting
mix
of
aromas
with
caramel
sugar
roasted
malt
cherry
and
grapefruit
up
front
flavors
of
chocolate
malt
leads
to
grapefruit
hops
then
a
little
smoke
with
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
and
a
sweet
malt
aftertaste
medium
body
medium
carbonation
leaves
a
creamy
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
ale
there
is
a
lot
of
different
flavors
and
aromas
going
on
in
this
beer
and
they
work
very
well
with
each
other
to
create
a
unique
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
complex
brown
ale
with
a
lot
going
on
in
the
glass
very
delicious

indian
brown
ale
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
more
of
it
and
as
it
warmed
up
i
kept
thinking
of
it
as
just
a
brown
ale
but
as
an
iba
then
i
think
that
denotes
this
beer
will
be
considerably
bigger
and
hoppiernot
your
trypical
session
brownand
its
certainly
every
bit
of
that
its
fairly
robust
so
id
say
drinkability
is
low
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
two
in
an
evening
an
excellent
beer
go
get
some
a
dark
brown
color
with
hints
of
red
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
beige
to
light
caramel
colored
head
forms
about
an
inch
on
top
the
robust
scent
of
caramel
and
chocolate
a
very
strong
the
aroma
ends
with
light
grassy
citrus
fragrance
the
malt
is
strong
with
the
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
it
finishes
with
a
grassy
and
mild
grapefruit
flavor
at
the
end
a
slick
to
light
oily
feel
at
the
front
becoming
more
hearty
and
chewy
as
it
reaches
the
back
it
has
mild
dry
finish
this
is
a
strong
brown
ale
almost
porter
like
in
color
and
aroma
the
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
and
scents
make
this
a
very
versatile
beer
it
would
great
with
anything
grilled
or
even
with
a
chocolate
desert
this
is
a
very
nice
complex
beer
and
damn
good
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
received
a
dark
syrup
brown
body
with
a
solid
onefinger
head
that
slowly
receeded
some
grassy
hops
mixed
with
sweet
and
roasted
malts
plus
some
caramel
and
honey
although
that
is
a
stretch
a
mix
of
hops
with
a
drying
sensation
and
caramel
and
other
sweet
malts
plus
some
sweetness
derived
from
something
like
bubblegum
or
cotton
candy
a
smooth
and
creamy
mediumbodied
beer
this
alternates
from
being
a
sweet
ale
with
other
malts
like
chocolate
and
bread
to
a
drying
stout
with
a
tad
bit
of
coffee
malt
throw
in
some
fruit
and
you
have
a
great
tasting
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
all
in
all
this
was
outstanding
i
wish
i
hadnt
waited
so
long
to
try
it
not
at
all
what
i
had
expected
in
a
good
way
d
a
pleasing
and
wellhopped
version
of
one
of
my

abv
is
at
the
higher
end
of
the
scale
for
a
brown
ale
the
bitter
finish
and
heavier
body
give
this
brown
ale
complexities
found
in
ipas
and
stouts
since
its
not
as
bitter
as
most
ipas
and
not
as
thick
as
most
stouts
this
beer
is
certainly
drinkable
for
me
this
is
another
outstanding
effort
from
the
folks
in
milton
de
this
beer
is
suppper
drinkable
a
smooth
and
luscious
mouthfeel
combined
with
good
flavor
make
it
an
essential
brown
ale
i
poured
it
from
a
12oz
bottle
from
central
market
i
took
a
big
drag
looking
for
an
aroma
not
much
hops
which
i
guess
is
expected
from
a
hopped
brown
the
flavor
is
pretty
dope
a
bit
of
hop
bite
with
a
sweet
malt
finish
a
tad
roasted
flavor
not
as
much
as
i
would
like
in
a
brown
a
must
try
for
sure
if
anything
i
regard
this
as
slightly
less
drinkable
just
because
i
realize
now
that
its
a
fairly
strong
beer
both
alcohol
and
flavorwise
either
way
if
i
were
to
walk
into
a
random
bar
and
see
this
id
be
excited
that
they
had
it
on
tap
i
was
very
satisfied
with
this
beer
and
will
definately
drink
more
of
it
in
the
future
cheers
d
great
brown
ale
but
i
have
had
better
worth
drinking
overall
a
great
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
very
flavorful
and
rich
in
dark
malts
if
that
is
your
style
though
i
would
not
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
dogfish
beers
had
a
halfhalf
at
brewpub
with
their
punkin
that
was
nice
d
very
very
good
beer
i
almost
drank
the
whole
thing
before
i
could
finish
the
review
extremely
tasty
with
many
many
elements
i
really
recommend
this
if
you
like
brown
ales
again
excellent
d
goes
down
with
the
best
of
em
i
kept
going
back
gulp
after
gulp
to
discover
new
flavors
and
before
i
knew
it
the
glass
was
nearly
empty
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ive
tried
plenty
of
beers
that
are
ranked
higher
on
this
site
that
are
simply
blown
away
by
this
baby
md
nice
heavy
full
mouthfeel
matches
perfectly
with
the
flavors
at
hand
the
carbonation
is
light
and
tight
making
for
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
texture
im
not
a
huge
brown
ale
guy
but
this
really
was
good
pretty
tasty
but
again
a
bit
outside
the
style
i
was
expecting
but
i
wont
hold
it
against
this
beer
but
i
might
hold
on
to
the
beer
a
delicious
variation
possibly
my
favorite
brown
ale
thanks
dfh
d
pretty
easy
drinking
for
such
a
full
bodied
beer
hv
mouthfeel
has
a
wonderful
dry
creaminess
to
it
sharp
feeling
carbonation
at
first
but
you
grow
accustomed
d
looked
at
this
beer
several
times
on
the
shelf
and
never
grabbed
it
now
im
pissed
i
never
have
excellent
balance
and
taste
definately
going
to
pick
more
up
tomorrow
tastes
sweet
malty
and
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sweet
brown
sugar
taste
that
really
stays
with
your
taste
buds
i
also
get
the
same
taste
that
i
get
from
a
cup
of
very
dark
coffee
that
has
sugar
collected
at
the
bottom
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
a
unique
style
that
i
think
works
very
well
pours
dark
coffee
black
with
rubyd
edges
fluffed
one
finger
head
forms
then
surrenders
to
a
single
ring
around
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
malty
syrup
biscuits
and
plum
taste
is
nice
big
sweet
malty
chocolate
grains
raisin
maple
a
bit
milky
and
coffee
with
a
floral
grape
finish
very
good
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
a
bit
soapy
all
and
all
very
good
but
a
bit
strong
in
the
abv
for
a
brown
ale
bottle
poured
a
deep
brown
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
nutty
caramel
malt
with
some
dry
hops
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
toffee
and
caramel
malt
which
are
well
balance
by
some
dry
light
bitter
hops
good
body
with
some
good
carbonation
very
well
done
for
a
session
ale
that
can
still
retain
some
character
d
its
got
enough
punch
both
in
flavour
and
abv
that
id
likely
only
do
a
couple
at
a
time
though
its
certainly
a
tasty
brew
that
i
will
enjoy
thoroughly
for
those
couple
quite
nicely
done
and
id
pick
up
more
without
hesitation
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
a
fantastic
creation
emptied
into
a
goblet
producing
about
a
finger
of
head
that
quickly
fades
away
to
a
small
film
just
covering
surface
not
much
lacing
present
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
sweet
coffee
smell
to
it
it
hits
you
with
big
roasted
malts
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
taste
from
the
brown
ales
that
im
used
to
drinking
this
is
quite
extreme
tasting
almost
like
a
stout
didnt
notice
lots
of
carbonation
from
looking
at
it
but
it
felt
like
there
was
plenty
while
in
the
mouth
this
is
one
from
dogfish
head
that
i
can
afford
to
drink
more
regularly
and
will
more
lively
and
bright
than
first
expected
with
bright
carbonation
and
a
slight
twang
in
the
finish
mild
buttery
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
dryness
medium
bodied
and
decently
creamy
especially
once
warmed
up
a
bit
throughout
with
a
lingering
roasty
bitterness
a
well
rounded
and
extremely
flavorful
brown
ale
one
of
the
poundforpound
best
examples
of
the
style
out
there
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
and
probably
will
d
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
from
dfh
and
restores
my
faith
in
them
after
raison
detre
and
golden
era
i
didnt
see
what
all
the
hoopla
was
about
regarding
this
brewery
but
this
beer
changes
that
this
is
one
delicious
beer
that
i
would
definitely
pick
up
whenever
i
saw
it
and
would
have
at
any
time
it
has
so
much
flavor
and
hides
its
alcohol
so
well
that
this
would
be
one
dangerous
brew
that
could
sneak
up
on
you
good
job
to
dfh
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
subtle
red
hues
in
the
light
the
head
is
tight
yet
thin
and
presents
itself
a
pale
choclate
color
a
vigorous
swirl
of
the
large
snifter
brings
the
head
to
life
for
a
brief
moment
and
then
it
settles
down
again
into
a
thin
layer
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
the
nose
is
rich
and
inviting
with
dominant
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
notes
intermingling
with
a
slightly
sweet
caramel
character
aromatic
and
floral
hop
notes
balance
the
richness
of
this
beer
making
for
a
very
complex
array
of
aromas
in
the
nose
the
palate
is
also
dominated
by
dark
semisweet
chocolate
espresso
and
a
very
subdued
dark
caramel
malt
sweetness
that
balances
the
beer
well
against
the
bittering
chocolate
notes
and
the
mildly
acidic
hop
profile
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
a
terrific
butterscotchlike
characteristic
that
makes
this
beer
all
the
more
interesting
to
me
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
rich
and
never
cloying
adequate
but
not
aggressively
carbonated
this
beer
is
a
study
in
the
balance
of
sweet
and
dry
flavors
without
leaning
too
heavily
on
either
in
my
opinion
at
7
2
abv
you
might
expect
the
alcohol
to
assert
itself
but
really
never
does
except
for
the
finish
which
is
pleasantly
warm
and
smooth
without
being
boozy
otherwise
the
finish
is
quite
dry
with
lingering
notes
of
espresso
in
the
mouth
a
very
very
complex
brown
ale
in
every
regard
once
again
dogfish
head
had
managed
to
take
what
i
typically
think
of
as
a
rather
mundane
beer
style
and
kick
it
up
several
notches
this
is
not
your
fathers
brown
ale
incredibly
rich
complex
and
challenging
id
be
hard
pressed
to
think
of
a
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
that
i
enjoyed
nearly
as
much
im
a
fan
possibly
too
high
in
alcohol
to
be
considered
a
sessionable
beer
but
i
could
drink
this
one
often
and
be
thrilled
about
it
dogfish
head
changing
one
mans
opinion
of
brown
ale
one
beer
at
a
time
ill
need
more
than
one
sixpack
of
this
one
terrific
another
offcentered
offering
from
dogfish
head
that
didnt
disappoint
its
smooth
and
tasty
a
big
nutty
toasty
brown
ale
with
a
strong
profile
its
very
well
balanced
and
very
complex
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
cheers
d
very
drinkable
brown
ale
with
many
unique
qualites
which
while
they
arent
my
favorite
do
show
why
so
many
bas
love
this
brown
ale
it
is
a
very
big
brown
ale
but
bigger
isnt
always
better
i
liked
this
beer
but
would
like
it
more
if
it
was
a
little
more
easygoing
and
less
like
a
porter
the
strong
hops
component
though
is
a
plus
this
beer
poured
a
really
dark
brown
much
darker
than
i
thought
as
it
was
almost
near
a
porter
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
brown
ales
in
the
past
but
the
ones
i
had
were
leaning
more
towards
the
clear
brown
side
i
didnt
take
great
notes
on
this
beer
but
what
i
do
remember
was
how
caramel
and
nutty
it
was
just
a
perfect
combination
of
flavors
bringing
all
that
richness
of
a
porter
but
leaving
out
the
roastiness
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
fuller
that
i
thought
it
would
be
if
it
were
just
a
tad
lighter
i
would
have
given
it
a
4
5
or
so
because
i
would
prefer
less
full
of
a
mouthfeel
for
a
brown
ale
with
just
a
touch
more
carbonation
in
it
but
this
is
splitting
hairs
with
this
beer
fantastic
easy
drinking
yet
7
2
beer
overall
with
a
great
rich
flavor
d
this
is
probably
the
best
american
brown
ale
that
ive
ever
had
brown
ales
have
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
but
this
one
is
a
definite
hit
very
unique
flavor
for
a
brown
not
particularly
nutty
and
not
porterlike
this
and
surly
bender
are
my
favorite
brown
ales
so
far
good
job
dogfishead
really
nice
brown
its
got
a
big
strong
body
but
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
great
balance
of
hopmalt
i
have
had
this
in
bottle
many
times
and
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
draft
brings
a
whole
other
dimension
to
it
probably
the
best
brown
ale
hands
down
i
enjoyed
this
dogfish
head
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
east
coast
breweries
d
great
beer
substantial
but
not
so
much
that
i
couldnt
have
a
few
d
this
one
grew
on
me
the
longer
i
drank
it
it
truely
is
a
beer
that
makes
less
of
a
first
impresssion
adn
more
of
a
lasting
one
this
will
make
a
great
cooler
beer
for
camping
trips
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
when
ive
had
it
in
the
bottle
so
i
decided
to
try
it
on
tap
at
the
dogfish
head
alehouse
gotta
say
it
was
quite
disappointing
the
appearance
was
nice
good
dark
brown
with
light
brown
foam
nose
is
lots
of
coffee
malt
but
the
chocolate
flavors
that
come
through
so
well
in
the
bottle
are
incredibly
muted
taste
is
similar
tons
of
roasted
malt
but
the
chocolate
and
fruitiness
seem
to
have
disappeared
basically
this
one
seems
like
a
stout
and
i
would
not
have
been
able
to
guess
that
this
was
the
same
beer
as
ive
had
in
the
bottle
so
many
times
not
bad
just
not
great
im
not
that
big
on
brown
ales
but
ill
try
to
be
objective
here
thick
creamy
head
that
yields
to
a
little
pale
surface
fizz
with
some
loose
lacing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
opaque
dark
brown
a
bit
like
a
porter
darker
than
say
a
newcastle
smells
like
well
a
brown
alevery
straightforwardbut
sweeter
more
biscuity
much
richer
than
the
aforementioned
newcastlebrown
sugar
molasseslike
fairly
chewy
mouthfeel
bitter
afterburn
not
so
sure
i
am
too
inclined
for
a
second
one
in
one
sitting
pretty
good
if
you
like
brown
ales
i
suppose
but
imo
there
are
more
appealing
beers
out
there
tastes
full
malty
and
the
aftertaste
is
very
strong
of
the
brown
sugar
this
is
the
beer
i
would
love
to
have
with
a
nice
big
dinner
its
7
2
but
is
still
fairly
drinkable
it
would
compliment
a
lot
of
meals
very
nicely
its
smooth
and
hearty
at
the
same
time
i
highly
recommend
it
although
i
am
a
little
biased
for
dfh
brews
with
a
nice
dollop
of
hersheys
syrup
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
alcoholic
bite
this
tasty
little
number
would
make
for
a
nice
aperitif
or
a
meal
all
its
own
for
that
matter
highly
recommended
d
this
one
is
great
in
that
it
works
well
as
both
a
slow
sipper
and
an
ordinairy
session
beer
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
leaves
one
in
the
mood
to
have
another
though
the
slightly
above
average
abv
can
sneak
up
on
you
after
a
few
if
you
are
not
careful
this
is
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
session
beers
and
a
must
have
in
my
refrigerator
dark
syrup
colored
beer
with
a
thin
head
on
top
smells
like
smoky
coffee
the
taste
begins
sweet
like
brown
sugar
with
a
slightly
smoky
taste
following
the
mouthfeel
is
a
pleasant
level
of
carbonation
not
too
thick
not
to
thick
perfect
for
after
dinner
it
has
a
decent
level
of
alcohol
so
i
wouldnt
drink
more
then
one
of
these
if
i
had
to
go
out
after
drinking
it
at
any
rate
what
i
can
say
is
that
the
beer
was
very
fresh
and
the
flavors
were
very
clean
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
were
good
but
i
did
not
care
for
the
taste
drinkability
is
solid
another
very
good
beer
from
dogfish
head
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
very
tasty
d
very
different
take
on
a
brown
ale
at
least
in
my
experience
very
tasty
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
see
this
brew
grab
it
definitely
one
of
the
best
browns
i
have
ever
had
the
extra
hops
really
make
a
good
brown
ale
great
d
another
winner
from
dfh
overall
a
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
d
no
hint
of
the
abv
while
drinking
this
is
in
that
weird
territory
between
treat
and
sessioner
it
drinks
easy
enough
to
session
but
is
was
too
strong
again
very
dogfish
this
may
have
become
my
favorite
beer
after
just
one
a
very
intensecoffe
like
brew
from
dogfish
the
extreme
toffelike
caffeine
flavored
flavor
smacks
you
in
the
mouth
grabs
you
by
your
tongue
and
doesnt
let
go
impressive
jetblack
hue
cowers
under
a
frothy
foamy
tan
head
smell
is
all
roasted
malts
coffee
and
darklatte
taste
strongly
complements
the
aroma
a
very
very
itense
cocoa
roasted
malts
darkchocolate
deep
caramel
slight
vanilla
flavor
that
really
hits
home
one
of
the
top
brews
from
dogfish
the
7
2
abv
is
not
noticed
at
all
just
a
thick
creamy
and
rich
cocoaespresso
flavor
that
parades
around
the
mouth
boasting
a
good
mouthfeel
and
decent
drinkability
despite
the
thick
rich
taste
that
dominates
the
taste
buds
good
flavorful
stuff
very
stout
or
porter
like
and
definitely
recommended
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
brown
similar
to
the
color
of
cola
with
no
light
penetration
onefinger
tan
head
decent
retention
and
ample
rings
of
sticky
concentric
lacing
scent
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
taste
yielded
a
much
more
pronounced
roasted
malt
flavor
as
well
as
a
hint
of
coffee
and
a
touch
of
hops
very
effervescent
fullbodied
mouthfeel
not
too
watery
and
not
too
chewy
with
a
subdued
combination
of
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
end
a
really
nice
american
brown
ale
with
a
pleasant
hoppy
presence
d
its
got
a
lot
of
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
chocolate
stout
at
times
solid
brew
but
nothing
id
run
back
to
in
summation
a
delicious
and
complex
beer
very
good
a
bit
pricey
at
the
store
where
i
bought
it
9
49sixer
but
worth
the
effort
notes
they
say
its
a
cross
between
a
scotch
ale
an
ipa
and
a
brown
ale
and
as
complex
as
it
is
theyre
about
right
its
different
than
most
brown
ales
out
there
thats
for
sure
the
flavors
blend
great
and
are
nice
and
balanced
easy
to
drink
mainly
because
its
so
darned
delicious
as
of
right
now
its
my
favorite
from
dogfish
head
and
one
of
my
favorites
period
a
very
good
example
of
brown
ale
very
much
drinkable
on
a
nonsession
basis
a
good
warming
feel
from
the
alcohol
content
and
a
great
winter
time
beer
to
pair
with
cheese
and
crackers
while
relaxing
overall
from
the
smell
to
the
balance
to
the
batchtobatch
consistency
a
great
example
of
what
a
craft
beer
should
be
flavorful
intriguing
yet
with
an
ability
to
appeal
to
more
than
just
hop
heads
big
beer
fans
and
other
craft
brew
fanatics
i
think
this
along
with
the
90
minute
are
dogfish¬ís
best
contributions
to
trying
to
broaden
taste
profiles
of
noncraft
beer
drinkers
dark

overall
it
is

and
well
done
like
most
of
their
beers

this
beer

a

there¬ís

than
a
few
of
these
and
it¬ís
certainly
not
unpleasant
a
feeling
of
contentness
resonates
through
out
me
let
this
beer
blossom
as
it
warms
put
me
in
a
recliner
by
the
fire
after
a
days
worth
of
skiing
and
i
might
be
right
next
door
to
heaven
d
extremely
sessionable
other
definition
of
craft
beer
flavorful
and
eyeopening
delicious
smell
is
of
caramel
with
chocolate
notes
taste
is
of
roasted
hops
chocolate
slight
coffee
tones
and
somewhat
sweet
has
a
really
great
finish
bubbles
are
small
but
tickle
the
mouth
all
in
all
a
really
fine
brew
although
its
not
my
favorite
it
is
still
an
excellent
beer
enjoyed
his
dogfish
brew
at
the
world
of
beer
in
westchase
in
tampa
fl
where
they
had
it
on
draft
served
in
a
dogfish
small
pint
glass
it
was
dark
in
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
smelled
of
molasses
and
coffee
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
as
a
matter
of
fact
after
i
tried
it
it
is
all
i
drank
the
rest
of
the
evening
i
found
it
to
have
a
very
complex
taste
hints
of
chocolate
raisins
and
typical
brown
ale
flavors
all
around
a
great
beer
a
great
beer
that
i
would
definitely
recommend
and
try
again
if
i
have
the
opportunity
drinkability
¬ñ
very
good
dogfish
makes
some
good
stuff
but
pricey
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
this
is
good
d
very
unique
and
complex
brown
ale
with
a
nice
balance
of
roasted
malts
caramel
sugars
and
bitter
hops
all
the
flavors
come
through
here
what
a
treat
edit
i
had
to
revisit
this
one
as
i
didnt
do
it
justice
the
first
time
having
had
it
again
fresh
this
is
the
best
dfh
brew
ive
ever
had
and
without
a
doubt
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
its
like
a
cross
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
porter
very
smoky
and
rich
and
delicious
the
hops
fit
perfectly
here
a
masterpiece
that
i
had
right
under
my
nose
this
whole
time
and
never
knew
it
pours
a
clear
but
pretty
dark
brown
nice
sized
tan
head
nose
is
evenly
roasted
flavor
is
smooth
and
robust
but
not
overpowering
seems
like
i
get
a
very
small
touch
of
alcohol
on
there
feel
is
smooth
decent
level
of
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
good
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
deep
and
appropriately
thick
definitely
worth
trying
drinkability
this
is
definitely
the
best
brew
i¬íve
had
by
dogfish
head
maybe
tied
with
90
minute
it¬ís
there
¬ìextreme¬î
interpretation
of
a
brown
ale
and
this
one
works
really
solid
tasty
brew
thanks
derick
d
great
beer
again
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
from
dfh
the
indian
brown
is
brown
in
color
but
a
very
dark
one
it
lets
a
little
bit
of
light
through
but
ive
seen
stouts
lighter
than
this
decent
one
inch
head
that
faded
moderately
fast
earthy
and
nutty
along
with
coffee
and
hops
in
the
aroma
theres
a
roasty
malt
and
chocolate
flavors
at
first
taste
a
good
bodied
creamy
feeling
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
back
of
the
throat
with
a
hops
and
alcohol
kick
in
the
finish
to
warm
you
up
it
does
the
trick
right
on
these
wintry
days
final
note
almost
perfect
all
in
all
a
very
nice
beer
if
youre
fond
of
the
richness
of
a
porter
as
i
am
but
prefer
the
taste
and
the
liveliness
of
an
ipa
this
beer
makes
for
a
nice
compromise
while
being
entirely
its
own
creature
hop
flavors
couldnt
be
anticipated
given
the
beers
bouquet
their
calm
and
earthy
but
bitterness
is
pronounced
dry
with
more
good
roast
and
and
a
touch
of
booze
i
really
like
this
as
it
is
a
really
well
crafted
beer
d
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
autum
day
in
november
a
nice
well
balanced
beer
and
id
grab
it
again
if
it
were
only
a
bit
cheaper
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
brown
ale
though
pours
great
with
a
nice
head
taste
has
a
hint
of
carmel
and
is
longlasting
a
little
dry
has
a
nice
dark
brown
look
with
a
perfect
creamy
head
fairly
smooth
but
has
some
bubbly
feel
and
also
a
slight
sweetness
in
the
beginning
strong
smelling
and
overall
nice
full
beer
perfect
for
a
nice
dinner
especially
chicken
theres
lots
of
carbonation
that
first
hits
the
tongue
and
its
malty
full
of
flavor
the
hops
are
almost
subdued
it
tastes
like
a
mixture
of
roasted
malt
with
citric
hops
and
you
dont
have
to
look
for
either
great
brew
better
than
most
brown
ales
poured
into
a
pint
glass
my
first
reaction
was
to
the
aroma
i
didnt
even
have
to
have
it
close
to
my
nose
smell
it
aroma
of
brown
sugar
caramel
and
bread
the
appearance
was
pretty
dark
for
a
brown
ale
more
the
color
of
a
porter
mouthfeel
was
more
fizzy
then
i
expected
in
a
brown
ale
but
in
a
good
way
very
full
bodied
at
a
little
more
then
7
abv
it
was
very
drinkable
and
i
couldnt
taste
an
obvious
alcahol
sting
definately
could
drink
this
all
evening
my
second
favorite
offering
from
dogfish
head
first
being
the
chicory
stout
this
beer
is
a
blend
of
a
scotch
ale
and
a
brown
ale
never
released
by
dogfish
head
and
the
90
minute
ipa
i
was
informed
of
this
at
a
dogfish
head
tasteing
on
long
island
at
the
kitchen
a
bistro
its
definately
interesting
d
this
is
an
excellent
offering
from
dfh
i
really
enjoy
dark
beers
that
are
hoppy
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
complex
brown
ale
with
sweetness
hops
and
malts
that
all
come
together
perfectly
very
drinkable
indeed
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
dfh
d
not
sure
i
would
want
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
a
nice
way
to
relax
and
wrap
up
the
day
drinkability
well
crafted
brew
excellent
and
complex
taste
drinkability
honestly
im
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
usually
find
the
roasted
flavors
overwhelm
but
this
was
not
the
case
here
this
beer
was
amazing
the
balance
was
incredible
and
as
the
name
says
it
was
like
an
ipabrown
ale
mixture
an
incredibely
creative
brew
and
one
that
is
always
welcome
in
my
minifridge
officially
a
dfh
fan
and
very
excited
for
more
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
slight
tan
head
it
smells
a
little
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
the
taste
starts
off
pleasantly
sweet
with
brown
sugar
caramel
and
chocolate
and
finishes
with
a
layer
of
hops
that
is
a
little
piney
and
spicy
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
and
i
would
consider
this
beer
to
fairly
drinkable
even
though
i
couldnt
imagine
having
more
than
a
couple
d
for
7
2
abv
the
beer
went
down
easy
though
it
is
not
beer
that
one
can
just
drink
in
a
quick
sit
down
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
sitting
down
chilling
and
shooting
the
old
times
drinkability
at
7
2
abv
probably
not
the
greatest
session
beer
but
man
does
it
go
down
smooth
i
could
easily
down
several
of
these
and
probably
will
as
the
oppurtunity
presents
itself
a
very
interesting
and
delicious
brown
with
stoutlike
qualities
as
my
wife
says
awesome
my
tigers
are
1
for
the
first
time
in
47
years
and
theyre
playing
oklahoma
for
the
big
12
championship
in
6
hours
so
this
will
likely
be
the
first
of
many
reviews
today
this
brew
was
a
great
start
had
this
on
tap
at
the
moan
and
dove
the
drink
had
a
very
dark
appearance
with
a
medium
head
aromas
of
caramel
small
amounts
of
chocolate
and
little
malt
lifted
from
this
beverage
beautifully
the
taste
was
great
a
creamy
sweet
drink
in
general
this
ale
had
a
lowmedium
body
which
made
it
thick
but
lighttasting
in
texture
overall
this
was
a
delicious
brown
ale
from
dogfish
head
edit
had
another
bottle
of
this
8110
in
az
still
as
good
as
i
remember
it
my
cousin
raved
as
well
d
decent
tasting
but
for
a
brown
it¬ís
definitely
extremely
hop
forward
and
that
coupled
with
the
thickness
lowers
the
drinkability
in
my
book
this
beer
poured
a
nice
brown
color
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
fluffy
off
white
head
the
smell
was
very
sweet
with
hints
of
hop
the
taste
was
also
of
malty
sweetness
with
an
iron
taste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
heavy
with
low
carbonation
overall
drinkability
was
ok
the
iron
taste
im
not
too
fond
of
this
comes
real
close
to
a
porter
in
feel
and
flavor
whatever
you
call
it
its
really
good
superbly
balanced
on
all
fronts
if
im
going
to
go
with
a
brown
ale
id
probably
make
it
this
one
over
the
multitudes
of
hohum
browns
out
there
best
american
brown
ever
could
be
recommended
nice
to
see
some
attention
to
a
style
that
is
often
overlooked
not
the
best
beer
around
but
a
good
one
overall
drinkability
this
is
very
enjoyable
but
not
a
session
beer
i
can
see
pairing
this
with
a
big
hearty
beef
stew
or
maybe
a
spicy
rack
of
ribs
d
great
beer
to
kickoff
those
crisp
fall
days

definetly

i
think
i
want
to
brew
something
kind
of
like
this
not
a
bad
beer
but
dfh
makes
better
the
complexity
and
alcohol
of
the
brew
could
exhaust
the
drinker
after
a
few
i
would
go
to
something
lighter
d
overall
a
difficult
beer
for
me
to
decide
on
a
bit
harsh
at
first
almost
like
old
coffee
but
it
improved
nicely
with
some
time
in
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
or
maybe
that
was
the
alcohol
content
not
something
that
i
will
probably
buy
again
but
i
cant
say
im
completely
opposed
to
having
another
my
experience
with
this
beer
seems
very
different
to
me
from
that
of
other
reviewers
so
i
might
find
myself
compelled
to
try
it
again
a
great
beer
all
the
way
around

does
it
again
mouthfeel
is
full
bordering
on
creamy
allinall
its
a
typical
lets
see
if
this
works
approach
by
the
boys
from
milton
its
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
but
when
trying
to
fit
it
into
the
brown
ale
category
it
fails
somewhat
perhaps
its
just
overambition
hell
ill
take
that
over
the
alternative
any
day
d
a
fine
brown
ale
w
candy
sugar
and
rich
maltiness
w
a
nice
touch
of
alcohol
int
the
flavor
a
nice
hop
accent
adds
a
bit
of
spice
i
consider
this
to
be
a
nice
brown
but
not
highly
drinkable
w
the
noticeable

caramelized
sugar
flavors
of
roasted
coffee
and
roasted
malt
are
most
prominent
the
body
and
carbonation
give
this
beer
a
very
light
feel
despite
its
darker
bold
flavors
equally
enjoyable
paired
with
a
juicy
burger
a
bit
of
chocolate
for

as
a
standalone
beer

case
to
keep
on

found
two

dark

a

throughout
aromas
of
spicy
hops
stand
behind
a
very
sweet
malty
touch
of
carmel
taste
is
first
and
foremost
of
the
brown
sugar
i
know
it
says
it
on
the
bottle
which
is
tough
to
get
past
not
a
flavor
i
am
very
fond
of
there
is
a
tinge
of
the
hops
but
this
beer
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
i
enjoyed
the
aroma
so
i
will
definately
be
cellering
a
couple
of
bottles
to
see
how
it
does
i
remember
this
beer
being
better
when
i
sampled
it
a
year
and
a
half
ago
now
it
seems
somehow
offbalance
like
theres
nothing
in
it
but
dark
malt
and
hops
its
not
as
sweet
as
i
remember
and
the
taste
is
just
a
constant
battle
between
roasted
charred
astringency
and
dry
hop
bitterness
reminded
me
of
porter
thats
missing
some
ingredients
maybe
this
batch
was
just
too
young
final
thoughts
i
can
appreciate
what
the
brewer
was
trying
to
achieve
however
although
the
brew
is
unique
it
is
not
great
to
me
its
not
session
beer
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
poured
an
attractive
brown
color
with
slight
offwhite
head
that
begs
to
be
drank
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
chocolate
with
a
maltiness
to
it
taste
was
also
of
caramel
and
chocolate
with
exceptional
hop
balance
lacing
was
good
mouthfeel
was
very
pleasant
this
was
a
really
nice
brown
ale
what
is
there
not
to
like
good
drinkability
alcohol
was
mostly
masked
some
heat
was
detected
from
the
alcohol
overall
wow
excellent
very
well
made
and
thought
out
brew
dogfish
head
has
impressed
me
once
again
im
glad
so
many
of
their
brews
are
available
in
my
area
now
if
i
could
just
get
my
hands
on
that
elusive
120
minute
pale
ale
please
note
i
would
have
given
this
beer
a
higher
score
but
i
don¬ít
really
care
for
coffee
pours
a
amber
brown
with
a
tan
head
leaving
some
nice
lacing
with
each
sip
smells
of
burnt
malts
and
some
hints
of
hops
the
taste
is
both
hoppy
and
of
sweet
roasted
malts
well
balanced
with
some
caramel
for
good
measure
some
where
between
a
session
beer
and
a
sipper
for
drinkablity
the
drinkability
of
this
decreases
a
little
because
the
hops
stand
out
a
little
to
much
and
the
7
2
adv
is
also
noticeable
otherwise
this
is
a
solid
beer
dogfish
head
iba
pours
a
deep
red
brown
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
richy
malty
caramel
and
chocolatey
roasted
malts
with
some
fruity
esters
and
hoppy
bitterness
the
flavor
is
crisp
hops
competing
with
sweet
and
dark
malts
smooth
and
delicious
this
is
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
im
definitely
not
putting
down
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
black
mahogany
tremendous
head
smell
and
taste
offer
espresso
dark
chocolate
and
a
surprising
degree
of
hoppishness
just
a
little
metallic
mouthfeel
is
creamy
at
first
ends
a
little
sticky
this
was
a
great
find
and
will
serve
as
a
yearround
replacement
for
averys
new
world
porter
drinkability
high
drinkability
smooth
and
tasty
decent
abv
not
much
carbonation
could
easily
have
several
of
these
in
a
night
good
brown
ale
okay
so
there
i
was
standing
in
the
beer
alse
staring
at
this
brew
with
a
split
decission
in
my
mind
i
hate
ipas
but
i
do
love
a
good
brown
ale
so
i
thought
to
myself
its
an
ale
how
so
bad
could
it
be
so
i
bought
it
so
heres
the
rating
on
first
glance
it
looked
great
but
that
inch
of
foam
in
my
glass
dissapered
pretty
quickly
but
it
did
leave
a
lacing
on
my
glass
the
smell
to
me
was
great
with
a
taste
of
coffee
and
hops
yet
again
to
me
the
taste
was
similar
to
a
stout
but
less
harsh
and
alittle
hoppy
but
not
too
strong
and
smooth
in
my
mouth
it
was
very
smooth
not
much
carbonation
and
easy
going
the
abv
in
this
brew
is
higher
than
most
beers
but
its
still
very
drinkable
so
i
would
recomend
this
with
a
good
meaty
meal
like
a
steak
or
something
of
that
nature
drinkability
high
drinkability
smooth
and
tasty
decent
abv
not
much
carbonation
could
easily
have
several
of
these
in
a
night
good
brown
ale
pours
an
opaque
darkness
with
a
full
finger
loose
tan
head
that
resists
fading
visible
surface
pools
of
effervescence
and
a
sheet
of
lacing
thats
along
the
full
length
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
really
rich
a
creamy
smoked
roast
malt
and
sweet
chocolate
aroma
mediumfull
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
yet
adequately
carbonated
with
a
nice
hop
tingle
the
flavor
is
quite
good
but
its
not
a
big
full
flavor
like
empire
downtown
brown
the
nose
is
bigger
than
the
flavor
im
enjoying
that
the
roasted
characteristic
is
in
the
zone
meaning
that
its
not
not
burnt
or
overwhelming
this
is
a
really
nice
drinker
im
surprised
that
its
weighing
in
at
7
2
abv
a
cross
between
a
scotch
ale
an
i
p
a
and
an
american
brown
this
beer
is
wellhopped
and
malty
at
the
same
time
super
deep
brown
color
with
a
nice
size
tan
head
rich
caramel
start
with
a
toasted
malt
and
slight
coffee
taste
rich
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
hint
of
some
darker
fruits
goes
down
smooth
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
in
the
aftertaste
d
while
not
as
high
for
me
as
with
the
60
minute
ipa
which
is
very
surprising
since
i
love
american
brown
ales
and
their
ilk
the
extra
alohol
hurts
drinkability
its
more
of
a
sipper
though
not
so
strong
that
it
isnt
refreshing
and
enoyable
great
beer
excellent
flavors
the
beer
had
good
medium
body
and
carbonation
it
felt
good
on
the
palet
and
was
fairly
drinkable
another
good
quality
beer
poured
into
an
imp
pint
dark
brown
with
orangered
tinges
nice
inch
of
mocha
colored
head
that
settled
down
into
a
thick
lumpy
blanket
molasses
dominates
the
nose
for
me
with
caramel
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
the
heat
that
is
to
come
taste
sweet
molasses
and
chocolate
up
front
followed
by
a
not
so
subtle
hop
profile
and
warming
heat
from
the
fairly
high
abv
definitely
leaves
the
mouth
something
to
think
about
for
a
while
after
its
gone
smooth
and
silky
contrasted
by
abrasiveness
of
the
hops
and
alcholic
heat
ill
never
sit
and
drink
a
6
of
this
beer
but
the
3
that
i
had
were
nice
for
the
first
cool
night
of
the
late
summerearly
fall
d
for
the
abv
i
found
this
to
be
a
surprisingly
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
beverage
this
is
not
normally
my
style
but
i
am
impressed
a
great
beer
tastewise
for
this
style
i
would
rank
it
behind
only
sam
smith¬ís
nut
brown
a
great
beer
im
a
sucker
for
most
things
dogfish
head
and
their
mad
scientist
brown
ale
is
no
exception
the
wholeleaf
hop
flavor
may
deter
some
but
for
ipa
fans
dabbling
in
american
browns
youll
feel
right
at
home
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
one
is
enough
i
think
more
than
one
might
be
too
sweet
for
me
but
in
terms
of
weight
and
bitterness
its
fine
just
a
little
unbalanced
poured
into
a
tulip
pint
glass
was
a
nice
brown
color
very
dark
mostly
light
blocking
had
a
nice
thick
foamy
milky
head
the
head
had
a
layer
the
whole
pint
with
traces
left
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
smelled
of
fresh
wheat
bread
with
hints
of
apricot
tasted
slightly
sweet
layers
of
brown
wheat
felt
good
in
the
mouth
slightly
tingly
on
the
tongue
coated
the
mouth
well
pleasant
to
drink
went
down
very
smoothly
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
hint
of
amber
color
little
head
is
present
smells
absolutely
fantastic
suggary
caramel
scent
is
great
has
also
a
slight
piney
hopness
to
it
im
a
big
fan
of
malty
beers
so
im
looking
forward
to
tasting
it
and
im
not
dissapointed
has
a
phenomenal
taste
to
it
just
great
lots
of
malty
warm
goodness
mouthfeel
is
good
my
ownly
complaint
is
that
it
could
use
a
little
more
body
but
thats
just
trying
to
be
nitpicky
as
allways
dfh
does
not
dissapoint
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
feel
that
i
should
have
purchased
this
gem
in
the
autumn
to
winter
months
nevertheless
i
dig
this
offering
first
time
i
tried
something
besides
the
dfh
ipas
60
90
120
min
another
solid
offering
from
de
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
carbonation
just
right
drinkability
is
high
despite
the
alcohol
content
which
is
wellmasked
anyway
exceeded
expectations
the
perfect
summer
dark
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
higher
abv
beers
simply
due
to
their
drinkability
but
this
one
was
amazing
and
well
deserved
of
the
high
rating
deep
rich
brown
color
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
nose
and
a
rich
smooth
mouthfeel
taste
is
rich
brown
malt
with
just
enough
hops
and
a
bit
of
astringent
alcohol
taste
to
keep
you
wanting
more
a
perfect
blend
of
bitterness
and
fruitiness
balanced
with
the
roasted
malts
phenomenal
and
so
fresh
since
its
brewed
so
close
recommended
by
my
friend
ian
at
i
m
wine
good
suggestion
served
to
me
a
very
dark
brown
resembling
a
stout
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
that
remained
and
laced
throughout
smells
of
sweet
malt
toasted
nuts
and
a
breath
of
fresh
hops
starts
off
tasting
of
some
toasted
malt
some
coffee
and
a
beautiful
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
some
carbonation
and
a
tasty
bite
from
the
hops
that
lingers
on
the
toungue
for
a
stout
this
is
good
for
a
brown
ale
this
is
fantastic
very
smooth
and
filling
if
it
were
winter
right
now
this
would
be
a
pint
of
3
liquid
crack
a
must
try
on
tap
my
only
experience
drinkability
is
pretty
good
worth
trying
but
id
grab
something
else
for
the
next
round
this
might
be
their
tweaked
rendition
of
tony
simmons
recipe
for
poor
richards
ale
created
for
the
brewers
association
to
commemorate
ben
franklins
300th
birthday
given
the
hot
alcohol
bite
and
dull
finish
id
have
placed
dfh
indian
brown
in
the
old
ale
category
instead
of
american
brown
feels
a
little
heavy
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
drinks
like
id
expect
a
winter
warmer
to
upfront
and
pushy
sedating
and
full
a
well
balanced
hybrid
of
brown
ale
and
stout
from
dfh
pours
a
rich
reddish
brown
with
purple
hues
when
held
up
to
light
and
is
accompanied
by
a
twofinger
tan
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
with
coffee
notes
followed
by
alcohol
the
taste
reminds
me
of
molasses
not
as
hoppy
as
id
expected
but
i
dont
feel
that
its
lacking
either
again
coffee
taste
in
the
finish
medium
body
with
a
crisp
finish
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
that
i
would
have
again
dark
but
clear
redtinged
brown
color
topped
with
a
fingers
worth
of
fine
and
reasonably
persistent
light
brown
head
the
smell
is
denser
and
more
complex
than
is
typical
for
the
style
part
of
that
is
the
hops
but
even
the
chocolaty
roasted
malt
base
invokes
a
porter
or
even
a
stout
more
than
a
brown
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
the
taste
as
well
which
is
malty
per
the
nose
and
sweet
sugars
and
dark
fruit
up
front
before
parting
for
the
hops
the
alcohol
is
evident
but
by
no
means
overwhelming
smooth
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
gets
dryer
in
the
finish
a
really
interesting
brown
ale
a
great
beer
d
im
not
one
that
goes
for
coffee
or
dark
chocolate
flavors
but
i
know
now
what
to
expect
from
a
quality
organic
brown
ale
its
complex
and
aromatic
and
it
reminds
me
of
sitting
by
the
fire
with
a
pretty
girl
in
the
dead
of
winter
right
now
in
the
heat
of
summer
not
so
much
despite
my
prejudices
i
cant
seem
to
put
the
glass
down
finally
splurged
on
a
bottle
at
bruisn
when
i
was
there
today
okay
at
2
bucks
not
really
splurged
but
got
one
none
the
less
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
lots
of
lace
left
over
on
the
sides
smell
was
lots
of
hops
pine
with
some
sweetness
mixed
in
a
touch
of
some
earthy
grassy
flavors
as
well
the
taste
was
great
good
malt
back
that
was
hoped
to
all
hell
very
fresh
taste
and
a
sstrong
biting
finish
alot
of
similarity
to
the
terrapin
brown
great
smooth
feel
lots
of
carbonation
made
it
go
down
smooth
with
a
nice
dry
finish
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
it
was
really
just
that
good
a
very
quality
session
beer
for
sure
just
a
treat
to
drink
and
i
will
definatly
be
looking
forward
to
the
next
time
i
am
around
grabbing
some
of
this
to
bring
home
smooth
with
good
complexity
pulled
from
a
medium
sized
body
the
indian
brown
is
more
drinkable
than
a
stout
or
porter
with
many
flavors
matched
at
7
2
it
gives
up
little
in
size
as
well
big
ass
ale
and
very
tasty
indian
brown
looks
pretty
nice
in
the
glass
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
with
at
ton
of
ruby
highlights
with
a
tight
head
comprised
of
tiny
bubbles
the
smell
is
caramel
malts
brown
sugar
alcohol
oak
and
vanilla
with
a
touch
of
grassy
hoppiness
the
taste
starts
out
all
dark
sweet
malts
and
sugars
you
can
pick
up
everything
from
lighter
caramels
to
roasted
chocolates
in
there
the
alcohol
is
also
fairly
noticeable
especially
at
warmer
temps
but
stays
under
the
control
of
malts
a
touch
of
oily
grassy
hops
adds
just
enough
bitterness
to
make
the
finish
really
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
yet
so
smooth
and
very
satisfying
drinkability
is
good
too
considering
your
mood
dont
grab
one
of
these
if
your
looking
for
a
classic
brown
ale
indian
brown
definitely
falls
close
to
the
line
between
brown
ale
and
porter
but
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
this
is
one
serious
beer
d
pretty
good
a
solid
brown
ale
however
not
exceptional
d
this
is
my
first
american
brown
although
ive
had
many
english
versions
of
the
brown
ale
i
definitely
see
the
difference
now
where
the
english
browns
are
malty
sweet
mild
and
easydrinking
session
brews
this
american
version
is
a
nutty
toasty
relatively
highly
hopped
slap
in
the
mouth
i
like
it
but
one
is
enough
for
now
what
can
i
add
to
the
previous
600
reviews
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
surprise
in
that
it
is
clearly
a
porter
and
borderline
imperial
russian
stout
a
nut
brown
ale
this
one
is
not
one
delicious
whiff
and
you
know
where
this
one
is
headed
the
beer
is
reasonably
carbonated
full
bodied
thick
with
a
decent
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
taste
is
chocolate
burnt
caramel
and
a
bit
of
coffeeish
flavor
as
well
its
the
burnt
almost
charcoal
flavors
that
are
most
characteristic
im
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
i
need
this
one
like
i
need
a
hole
in
the
head
if
i
only
knew
i
would
have
saved
it
for
a
chilly
january
instead
the
malts
hops
and
burnt
flavors
are
all
dancing
about
and
are
well
balanced
in
that
they
all
equally
hit
you
over
the
head
there
is
nothing
subtle
about
this
beer
this
is
a
very
good
beer
not
a
nut
brown
and
definitely
not
a
summer
beer
save
it
for
the
winter
months
and
it
will
be
even
more
greatly
appreciated
the
abv
is
high
but
the
alcohol
flavors
are
subdued
and
this
is
appreciated
lchaim
i
like
this
beer
its
drinkable
no
flavors
really
stand
out
to
me
i
dont
have
any
experience
with
this
style
never
heard
of
it
before
its
a
good
beer
for
a
warm
summer
evening
its
dark
and
rich
but
refreshing
shockingly
smooth
especially
considering
the
abv
and
bewitchingly
complex
i
could
drink
this
every
day
d
i
am
usually
impressed
with
dfh
and
this
is
no
exception
another
great
example
of
a
style
breaker
i
have
come
to
realize
that
dogfish
head
doesnt
go
half
way
on
any
beer
as
my
boss
says
me
vida
es
a
todo
madre
the
same
for
everything
they
brew
they
call
this
beer
an
american
brown
ale
but
you
could
almost
put
this
in
the
imperial
stout
catagory
looks
great
almost
black
smells
potent
but
inviting
taste
is
is
like
wang
dang
sweet
p
well
you
know
actually
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
dogfish
head
needs
to
tone
it
down
everything
is
tooo
over
the
top
7

abv
why
i
say
this
as
90
min
might
be
my
atf
good
beer
if
you
are
drinking
one
beer
can
dfh
save
me
from
a
world
of
boring
brown
ales
12oz
single
bottle
pours
a
dark
ruby
without
much
head
but
lots
of
little
bubbles
light
aroma
of
malt
not
off
to
a
great
start
yet
ah
but
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
heavy
on
the
malts
and
a
lot
of
flavour
overall
im
getting
some
roasted
coffee
flavours
in
a
blind
taste
test
im
sure
i
would
have
mistaken
this
for
a
porter
this
beer
is
tasty
complex
and
drinkable
i
wish
that
dfh
would
take
a
couple
notes
from
this
beer
and
apply
it
to
some
of
their
other
offerings
pours
a
deep
rich
dark
brown
with
a
nasty
brownishwhite
foam
on
top
a
good
thing
mind
you
shines
a
bright
orange
at
the
sides
when
held
up
to
the
light
leaves
some
lace
too
but
not
much
the
aroma
is
subdued
here
im
not
sure
what
im
missing
but
i
cant
seem
to
detect
much
of
any
one
thing
some
malt
some
coffee
some
bitter
chocolate
some
molasses
but
not
much
any
of
them
nice
but
not
terribly
convincing
the
taste
is
where
everything
begins
to
come
together
in
my
opinion
rich
roasty
coffee
flavors
mixed
with
hoppy
bitterness
sweet
vanilla
bakers
chocolate
and
woody
spices
very
complex
a
bit
too
big
for
its
own
britches
to
be
honest
because
its
so
damn
ambitious
but
its
tasty
nonetheless
just
like
a
cross
between
a
scotch
ale
an
ipa
and
an
american
brown
ale
should
be
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
at
7
2
abv
id
hardly
call
this
a
session
beer
but
its
still
a
solidly
drinkable
brown
might
go
best
with
some
chocolates
by
the
fire
in
the
winter
with
a
loved
one
by
your
side
then
again
im
sippin
on
this
puppy
in
the
middle
of
june
and
still
enjoying
it
give
it
a
try
aic
d
reasonable
but
storng
so
be
cautious
overall
a
very
nice
beer
leaves
a
bit
of
a
burnt
bitter
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
but
still
quite
drinkable
me
like
very
nice
american
brown
ale
thick
rich
quite
good
lots
of
crisp
floral
goodness
and
deep
sweet
malt
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
abales
very
tasty
very
enjoyable
alcohol
isnt
really
noticeable
but
you
can
feel
it
pretty
quickly
so
id
handle
this
one
with
care
7

alcohol
by
volume
outstanding
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
and
very
interesting
brew
its
quite
complex
and
is
definately
worth
a
try
d
this
is
a
great
beer
from
dfh
i
remember
having
it
in
the
past
but
not
really
understanding
it
now
i
can
appreicate
the
charm
of
this
beer
smell
is
lightly
burnt
cereals
and
sort
of
a
combination
of
floral
and
earthy
hops
seems
well
balanced
taste
is
sweet
malts
up
front
followed
by
the
hoppy
profiles
through
to
the
finish
there
is
also
a
detectable
note
of
alcohol
in
this
as
well
i
find
this
rather
odd
since
this
is
only
72
but
it
is
there
weak
but
there
all
the
same
the
body
is
full
as
should
be
some
sweeter
notes
rather
limits
the
mouthfeel
that
could
use
more
chocolate
notes
but
balances
well
good
carbonation
for
style
overall
a
very
nice
drinking
brown
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
perhaps
its
just
not
for
me
i
really
respect
what
theyre
doing
and
they
did
a
good
job
i
enjoy
the
flavor
but
its
too
much
of
a
mix
between
a
great
dark
beer
and
a
refreshing
ipa
and
it
leaves
my
mouth
confused
highly
recommend
everyone
try
this
overall
a
very
good
offering
from
dfh
definitely
my
favorite
after
the
90minute
ipa
i
agree
with
others
that
say
it
seems
more
like
a
stout
than
an
ipa
in
my
opinion
it
seems
like
a
breakfast
stout
and
its
very
misplaced
for
a
warm
evening
like
tonight
but
thats
my
doing
and
its
definitely
nice
to
relax
with
i
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
to
a
50
degree
tumbler
the
beer
was
a
pretty
dark
mohogany
color
with
a
tan
thivck
big
head
the
beer
had
decent
lacing
also
a
hoppy
smell
foole
me
because
the
beer
i
thought
was
well
hop
balanced
i
dont
want
a
hop
bomb
in
a
brown
ale
and
it
was
not
toasted
nuttyness
aftertaste
was
good
i
will
buy
again
d
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
that
i
have
sampled
quite
complex
for
the
style
i
love
the
hopped
up
effect
in
this
brew
recommended
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
beer
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
much
like
the
smell
of
a
dry
stout
there
is
some
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
coffee
and
hops
in
the
nose
the
taste
start
out
with
a
nice
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
then
the
hops
quickly
hit
you
for
a
nice
lingering
hoppy
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
that
will
surely
make
a
repeat
apperance
in
my
fridge
recommended
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
noticed
the
alcohol
more
than
i
wanted
to
but
then
again
it
is
7
2
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
decent
amount
of
foam
that
leaves
some
lacing
aroma
is
highly
complex
reminds
me
of
raisins
for
for
some
reason
not
even
the
raison
detre
with
some
other
fruit
flavors
and
a
slighty
malty
backbone
with
hints
of
alcohol
taste
is
simple
and
straightforward
with
the
same
fruity
flavors
i
do
however
taste
a
dullness
in
the
background
that
kind
of
ruins
the
overall
finish
what
i
mean
is
that
it
goes
down
good
but
i
dont
like
the
aftertaste
starts
out
promising
but
unless
the
bottle
itself
has
been
sitting
for
too
long
doesnt
quite
impress
me
as
much
as
id
hope
i
must
try
beer
yuuum
on
tap
at
durty
nellies
appears
very
deep
dark
brown
with
little
head
aromas
reminded
me
of
a
porter
taste
is
the
highlight
rich
coffee
chocolate
and
malt
with
a
nicely
balanced
hoppiness
very
mouthfilling
feel
my
friend
ordered
this
serval
times
a
testament
to
drinkability
purchased
a
bottle
of
this
at
beers
of
the
world
in
rochester
ny
i
think
drank
it
sitting
out
on
my
deck
on
the
nicest
day
weve
had
this
spring
20c
a
solid
brown
ale
with
a
good
dose
of
american
hoppyness
that
made
it
very
refreshing
on
such
a
warm
day
very
drinkable
although
a
little
high
on
the
abv
not
apparent
from
flavour
carbonation
was
just
right
aroma
a
little
on
the
weak
side
but
could
have
been
the
environment
would
go
great
with
some
mildly
spiced
grilled
chicken
or
steaks
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
two
finger
tan
head
that
holds
for
a
while
then
settles
to
just
cover
the
beer
with
some
nice
sticky
lace
to
the
finish
aromas
of
coffee
and
caramel
are
there
but
not
very
strong
taste
is
what
makes
this
beer
rich
strong
coffee
flavor
not
bitter
just
strong
mixed
with
dark
caramel
and
brown
sugar
and
some
warmth
from
the
alcohol
make
for
a
great
taste
mouthfeel
light
and
smooth
with
good
carbonation
so
far
the
best
brown
ale
i
have
had
edit
just
tasted
again
from
same
sixer
six
months
later
holds
up
very
well
this
review
is
still
quite
descriptive
of
the
beer
even
after
sitting
in
the
sc
heat
here
courtesy
of
matthews
poor
handling
d
very
drinkable
heavy
and
somewhat
filling
but
very
enjoyable
would
complement
a
chocolate
dessert
well
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
too
filling
good
kick
as
most
dfh
beer
have
good
representation
of
style
while
being
a
bit
different
in
keeping
with
the
dfh
hallmark
it¬ís
a
good
beer
to
stick
with
for
an
evening
looks
nice
but
there
isnt
much
lacing
or
head
the
smell
comes
and
goes
sometimes
theres
rich
chocolate
and
roasted
grains
other
times
its
just
mellow
sweetness
its
not
too
thick
and
its
alright
but
the
flavor
is
a
little
too
mixed
theres
a
harsh
bitterness
and
not
much
from
the
hops
worth
a
try
though
served
slightly
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
poured
a
dark
copper
brown
color
about
one
good
finger
of
thin
offwhite
head
formed
and
quickly
dissapeared
not
much
in
the
way
of
lace
smell
somewhat
thick
nutty
caramel
aromas
nice
smokey
notes
in
the
background
a
rather
pleasant
nose
on
this
one
taste
smokey
roastytoasty
tones
up
front
sweet
caramel
nut
flavor
moderate
carbonation
no
alcohol
present
somewhat
of
a
full
thick
flavor
to
it
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
the
beer
poured
a
crisp
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
slowly
diminished
the
aroma
was
of
chocolate
and
brown
malts
uniquely
balanced
with
citrus
hops
the
taste
leans
a
little
heavy
toward
the
hops
but
a
good
chocolate
malt
backbone
provides
a
truly
unique
taste
the
beer
is
light
bodied
for
one
at
7
2
alcohol
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
easily
my
favorite
brown
ale
d
great
i
will
enjoy
this
more
in
the
future
surprised
to
find
this
one
on
tap
and
it
exceeded
expectations
drinkability
this
beer
is
deceptive
this
makes
you
think
you
want
to
session
it
it
tastes
great
goes
down
easy
however
this
ale
is
far
more
substantial
than
you
think
it
is
you
can
become
pretty
full
if
you
try
to
pound
these
also
the
7
2
abv
is
up
there
for
a
brown
ale
itll
catch
up
with
you
in
a
hurry
not
really
a
session
beer
pours
out
a
dark
leathery
cherrywood
with
a
creamy
khaki
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
and
leaves
spiderweb
lace
in
the
nose
there
is
chocolate
some
roasted
barley
and
a
wonderful
underlying
presence
of
the
goldings
flavor
errs
more
towards
robust
porter
territory
and
im
fine
with
that
good
bit
of
chocolate
with
a
punch
of
roast
hops
dont
add
much
bitterness
to
this
which
i
think
any
bitterness
perceived
in
this
would
partly
come
from
the
roasted
malt
rather
the
hops
give
this
an
earthy
and
herbal
flavor
in
the
finish
finish
is
somewhat
drying
but
there
is
still
some
residual
sweetness
there
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
the
tiny
bubbles
get
a
little
annoying
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
and
the
high
abv
doesnt
make
this
an
ideal
session
i
really
love
that
this
is
an
americanbrewed
brownporterwhatever
that
doesnt
get
all
muddled
up
with
citric
hops
nice
earthy
hops
accompany
the
earthy
malts
well
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
made
beer
in
dfhs
lineup
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
lot
of
personality
to
it
this
is
a
mighty
brown
ale
if
i
could
name
it
i
would
call
it
an
imperial
brown
ale
the
stronger
alcohol
and
hop
presence
makes
this
a
truly
unique
brew
not
typical
of
the
style
but
very
flavorful
and
rather
complex
definitely
recomended
the
taste
start
off
with
roasted
grains
then
a
huge
blast
of
hops
drives
a
hop
spike
righ
thru
the
mid
palate
then
the
smooth
coffee
taste
balances
this
surprising
dry
beer
most
of
dogfish
head
beers
tend
to
be
on
the
sweet
side
the
mouthfeel
is
med
lt
the
drinkabilty
is
very
above
average
with
its
huge
hop
surprise
and
tasty
coffee
flavor
ill
be
back
for
more
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
forming
a
12
inch
head
leaving
light
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
malts
a
sweet
nutty
flavor
along
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
maybe
some
caramel
flavor
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
maybe
a
little
thicker
than
expected
but
smooth
overall
this
is
a
great
brown
ale
however
i
have
to
say
for
the
price
i
have
tasted
other
brown
ales
that
match
this
and
can
be
had
for
cheaper
definitely
worth
a
try
an
experimental
brew
that
is
certainly
worth
trying
and
they
do
combine
ipa
with
brown
ale
there
is
something
about
it
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
that
holds
me
back
from
liking
it
even
more
poured
roughly
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
big
fluffy
tan
head
that
retains
very
well
leaving
sticky
lacing
around
the
top
of
the
glass
the
beer
is
a
very
saturated
hue
of
brown
and
if
you
hold
it
up
to
light
you
can
see
the
moderate
carbonation
the
smell
is
rich
roasted
malts
that
almost
have
a
coffee
twist
transitioning
into
a
brief
pineappleish
whiff
of
hops
the
flavor
is
extremely
complex
its
like
someone
took
a
really
caramelroasted
malt
brown
ale
like
rogue
and
mixed
with
about
5
of
an
american
strong
ale
like
oaked
arrogant
bastard
to
come
up
with
this
really
cool
brew
it
doesnt
have
any
hop
bite
but
you
can
certainly
taste
them
the
aftertaste
is
also
pleasant
with
a
fresh
ground
coffee
feel
i
like
it
a
lot
a
very
nice
brown
ale
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
smells
of
yeast
and
old
wood
very
well
balanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
tastes
of
roasted
malt
brown
sugar
and
molasses
a
small
blast
of
hops
at
the
end
great
a
delicious
brew
time
to
go
back
and
buy
more
quite
smooth
and
relatively
creamy
not
particularly
filling
i
find
i
want
another
appropriate
carbonation
on
the
light
side
overall
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
a
sixer
this
wont
last
long
after
having
imbibed
this
brands
ipa
90
had
to
give
this
ale
a
shot
i
was
not
disappointed
its
very
dark
amber
appearance
initially
made
me
think
i
was
going
to
experience
a
porterlike
taste
but
it
was
in
fact
a
hefty
brown
ale
true
to
its
moniker
the
olfactory
senses
were
enamored
by
the
subtle
yet
powerful
odor
of
a
medium
gravity
alcohol
aura
it
hit
the
taste
buds
with
alternating
tones
of
java
and
chocolate
with
a
faint
taste
of
brown
sugar
that
cleansed
the
palate
it
did
not
cling
to
the
mouth
but
went
down
clean
and
easy
its
drinkability
quotient
is
high
because
while
it
is
filling
it
leaves
the
beer
aficionado
wanting
just
one
more
not
too
heavy
just
right
goes
well
with
minestrone
and
a
veggie
sandwich
pours
a
clear
rubybrown
with
a
nice
sticky
foam
head
smell
is
an
interesting
combination
of
brownsugar
sweetness
and
hops
tastes
much
as
the
name
suggests
a
nice
darkroasted
sweetness
reminiscent
of
a
brown
ale
backed
with
an
interesting
hop
punch
on
the
back
end
the
sweetness
reminds
me
of
the
brown
sugar
listed
as
an
ingredient
and
combined
with
the
roasted
malt
conjures
images
of
sweetened
coffee
the
hops
provide
a
nice
bittering
and
act
almost
as
a
palate
cleanser
here
overall
i
think
they
did
an
interesting
job
of
combining
the
flavors
and
achieve
a
very
nice
balance
this
will
be
a
regular
in
the
rotation
drinkability
if
you
are
looking
for
big
ibus
and
hop
aroma
in
a
brown
this
is
your
beer
one
could
easily
kick
back
several
with
little
trouble
but
why
when
you
could
enjoy
something
else
the
rich
opaque
chocolaty
color
demands
at
least
a
taste
aroma
is
hoppy
and
gets
the
lips
smacking
taste
is
rich
dark
and
hoppy
however
i
did
taste
this
over
some
hops
which
doubtless
changed
the
taste
still
i
did
get
hints
of
nuttiness
and
i
dont
believe
the
unusual
circumstances
affected
the
tempting
color
definitely
worth
trying
overall
a
solid
brown
with
a
huge
roasted
flavor
profile
a
notch
above
but
lets
not
get
too
carried
away
worth
a
try
d
this
one
is
an
easydrinking
beer
with
a
bit
of
complexity
for
the
tastebuds
making
it
something
id
go
back
to
if
i
needed
to
switch
it
up
after
a
regular
old
brown
ale
bottom
line
this
is
a
top
notch
example
of
the
style
that
is
a
must
try
taste
is
rich
with
roasted
malt
flavors
mixed
with
hints
of
acrid
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
nut
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
crisp
with
a
good
aftertaste
the
coffee
flavor
lasts
the
longest
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
from
dogfish
for
a
brown
ale
it
does
its
job
exceedingly
well
ill
be
having
this
again
soon
d
overall
a
good
beer
for
after
dinner
or
lunch
another
solid
brew
from
dfh
overall
a
good
example
of
an
american
brown
ale
and
another
good
brew
from
dfh
pours
with
a
finely
textured
12
head
that
subsides
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
aroma
of
dark
toasted
malt
very
clean
very
dark
in
color
with
brownish
hues
around
the
edges
huge
toasty
malt
flavor
is
perfectly
balanced
by
the
hoppiness
hops
are
present
but
not
over
the
top
perfect
for
this
brew
caramel
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
flavors
weave
in
and
out
on
the
palate
very
nicely
crafted
brew
from
dfh
i
like
this
one
a
lot
is
this
your
typical
american
brown
ale
no
way
more
like
an
imperial
brown
if
there
were
such
a
style
what
make
this
beer
a
standout
is
its
drinkability
it¬ís
a
big
brown
with
lots
of
roasted
malt
flavor
that
lingers
on
the
palate
long
after
it¬ís
gone
drinkability
is
great
very
well
balanced
almost
no
alcohol
coming
through
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
pours
a
quite
dark
brown
with
a
relatively
thin
head
but
very
good
lacing
one
of
the
darker
brown
ales
and
with
ruby
highlights
the
smell
is
dry
and
hoppy
with
an
underlying
aroma
of
brown
bread
the
taste
is
really
quite
remarkable
big
and
bold
for
a
brown
ale
with
an
unusually
strong
hop
presence
for
the
style
and
warming
spicy
flavors
it
has
the
same
underlying
dense
brown
bread
background
with
spicy
hop
notes
overlaying
there
is
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
not
raisiny
more
a
bready
sweetness
with
some
malt
notes
really
nice
body
robust
and
full
bodied
but
not
overly
heavy
really
probably
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
i
would
think
this
beer
would
be
a
great
session
beer
but
with
a
7
2abv
one
might
be
limited
to
how
much
time
one
was
partying
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
this
a
very
lively
brown
ale
and
it
has
feeling
to
it
not
watery
one
bit
and
the
carbonation
is
pleasant
another
great
ale
from
dfh
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
very
little
head
smells
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
slight
fizzy
mouthfeel
tastes
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
very
nice
smooth
quite
good
but
the
drinkability
is
a
bit
lower
than
i
might
like
due
to
the
molassesy
taste
pours
dark
ruby
with
a
finger
of
tan
foam
that
quickly
subsides
to
film
and
lace
in
the
nose
the
beer
is
a
deft
mix
of
pinelike
hops
caramel
malt
and
sweet
brown
sugar
alcohol
fruitiness
lingers
in
the
background

beer
no

which
could
be
bad
news
because
brewery
said
they
started
dating
all
bottle
two
years

this
beer
pours
very

has
a

the
taste
is
like
it
smells
along
with
roasted
coffee
i
cant
help
notice
the
alcohol
presence
the
beer
seem
lifelessflat
but
it
could
be
due
to
a
very
old
six
pack
i
really
like
brown
ales
but
this
type
of
brown
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
hope
to
find
this
beer
again
because
im
sure
i
purchase
an
outdated
6pack
which
explains
my
much
lower

great
flavors
going

it
doesnt

to
me
its

how
about

i
will
have
to

could
be
a

of

we

here
is
a
really
great
beer
that
i
have
avoided
for
a

just

i
dont
like
badly
executed
versions
of
the

a
super
drinkable
beer
that
you
must
try
even
if
you
dont
normally
care
that
much
for
brown
ales
the
only
thing
that
excludes
this
from
being
a
session
ale
is
the
alcohol
hit
it
provides
this
is
the
only
brown

the

it

carbonation
is
lively
on

for
a

but
more
than

for
the

this
brew
suggests
at
moments
complexities
of
flavor
beyond

nothing
straight
ahead
or
booring
about
this
delicious
brew
alcohol
is
noticable
but
well
hidden
and
serves
only
to
add
another
layer
to
the
complexity
of
other
flavors
i
treat
this
beer
as
special
and
like
to
drink
it
infrequently
to
preserve
the
gratification
factor

it
wouldnt

very
much
like
a

it
has
definitely
earned
some
of
my
respect
for
what
id
previously
considered
an
overrated
brewery
big
dark
sweet
great
winter
brew
o
tasty

i
love
the
unique

the

is

one
of
my
favorite

offerings
from
any
brewery
available
to
me
not
as
pungent
or
acrid
as
beers
of
this
style
and

usually
are
has
the
same
malty
flavor
youd
get
from
a
milder

which
i
appreciate
damn
fine
brew
ive
recently
begun
to
step
back
back
a
bit
from
the
big
stoutporter
beers
that
beat
you
about
the
head
and
neck
regardless
of
how
much
i
love
them
see
my
review
of
averys
mephistopheles
for
where
i
stand
nevertheless
this
brew
is
up
there
on
my
charts
thick
big
and
black
it
is
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
keep
your
smartass
racistphallic
interpretations
to
yourself
this
is
quite
a
departure
from
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
the
guys
at
dogfish
for
sure
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
thinking
of
a
brute
of
a
beer
on
a
cold
winter
night
not
recommended
for
the

types
that
would
be
offended
by
a
maltheavy

just

dfh
for
this

is

sipper
to

during

i
will

pick
this
up
again
i
never
knew

a

could
be

now
a
bright

vibrant
kick
in
the
nutty

wonderful

flavors
come

nicely
caramel

butterscotch
give

a

slight

doesnt

first
drain

not

of
this
poured
from
a
062012
bottle
never
had
a
fresh
bottle
a
very
nice
beer
from
dogfish
head
once
again
this
one
had
an
enjoyable
taste
to
it
and
went
down
a
lot
easier
than
i
had
imagined
going
in
the
nose
could
have
been
a
little
more
pronounced
with
some
notes
proving
a
little
difficult
to
detect
but
once
given
some
time
to
open
up
things
started
to
be
a
little
more
noticeable
the
alcohol
was
fairly
well
hidden
with
only
small
amount
coming
through
and
the
sweetness
in
the
taste
was
very
nice
a
great
beer
overall
and
definitely
one
that
id
like
to
try
again
hopefully
i
can
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
somehow
this
is
my
god
damned
go
to
beer
my
regular
its
delicious
and
different
its
for
people
who
think
stone
brewing
makes
weak
tasting
beers
propers
to
dogfish
head
this
beer
is
the
pinnacle
of
brown
ales
period
drank
one
and
it
was
delicious
put
the
other
three
in
the
cellar
to
enjoy
over
the
years
the
fact
that
this
particular
bottle
was
aged
for
six
months
gave
this
dogfish
holy
tree
beer
a
full
masterful
taste
of
caramel
and
smooth
flavor
i
will
have
this
one
ranked
in
top
3
in
the
dogfish
line
this
is
dfh
at
its
finest
had
the
good
fortune
of
picking
up
three
bottles
of
the
first
batch
ever
released
21108
this
is
definitely
a
fantastic
beer
to
age
ive
never
had
a
12
beer
taste
so
smooth
hints
of
toffee
caramel
and
chocolate
all
imparted
by
the
palo
santo
wood
its
such
a
dark
beer
you
forget
its
a
brown
ale
and
not
a
stout
a
ton
of
respect
for
dfh
it
cost
them
140000
to
make
the
vessel
made
from
palo
santo
wood
yet
this
is
the
only
beer
thats
made
in
that
vessel
and
its
nowhere
close
to
being
their
top
selling
beer
bottled
date
81312
age
has
made
this
beer
more
complex
fantastic
beer
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
firstly
i
was
a
big
fan
of
the
palo
santo
wood
it
basically
took
oak
taste
and
removed
some
of
the
aspects
of
that
taste
which
i
didnt
like
thus
making
an
even
better
wood
taste
i
love
the
dark
opaque
appearance
something
that
most
brown
ales
lack
the
feel
of
this
beer
in
my
mouth
was
incredible
as
well
so
smooth
and
creamy
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
almost
definitely
recommended
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
in
the
future
overall
really
good
one
of
my
favorites
for
an
everyday
available
dogfish
this
is
amazing
super
dark
and
tons
of
flavor
brown
ale
whatever
drinks
more
like
a
stout
to
me
but
they
could
call
this
american
brown
dishwater
for
all
i
care
simply
one
of
the
best
new
to
me
beers
ive
tried
in
a
long
time
would
love
to
age
a
few
if
i
can
exercise
the
patience
one
of
my
all
time
favoritesi
remarks
this
is
a
great
beer
ill
definitely
have
it
again
and
again
overall
i
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
this
beer
earlier
because
it
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorites
from
dfh
it
surprises
and
delights
me
every
time
i
come
across
this
treat
being
unique
is
great
but
to
be
this
different
yet
still
so
well
put
together
is
exceptional
it
is
not
every
day
that
a
yearround
offering
from
any
brewery
deserves
a
5
in
any
category
but
palo
santo
most
certainly
does
it
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
this
was
a
stunning
beer
and
a
glaring
reminder
to
me
as
to
why
i
enjoy
craft
beer
not
only
was
it
super
unique
it
was
very
well
crafted
what
else
should
i
expect
from
dogfish
head
ill
be
snagging
a
bottle
of
this
next
time
i
see
it
so
i
can
try
it
again
it
is
definitely
something
oneofakind
and
special
as
with
many
brews
from
dogfish
head
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
with
a
unique
after
tasted
that
is
highly
impacted
almost
dominated
by
the
high
alcohol
content
12
it
has
an
array
of
flavors
and
the
after
taste
comes
across
as
almost
tart
certainly
more
than
most
brown
ales
from
the
look
of
the
beer
as
you
pour
it
you
expect
a
very
full
mouth
feel
as
the
beer
appears
very
dark
and
thick
but
surprisingly
it
has
a
rather
light
to
moderate
mouth
feel
i
personally
really
like
one
bottle
but
would
not
enjoy
drinking
multiples
at
one
sitting
one
of
my
favorite
go
to
beers
probably
my
favorite
brown
great
glass
snifter
notes
totally
worth
trying
have
an
average
brown
ale
before
you
try
this
one
so
you
can
appreciate
how
special
it
is
a
total
winner
a
little
too
strong
for
me
couldnt
even
finish
it
o
this
one
has
incredible
depth
the
wood
casks
really
impart
a
lot
to
this
one
it
should
be
considered
an
imperial
brown
ale
as
well
strong
and
heavy
i
was
not
a
fan
what
stands
out
most
for
me
is
the
taste
and
feel
of
this
brew
at
the
end
and
how
it
lingers
in
my
mouth
need
to
pick
up
a
new
bottle
to
compare
not
what
i
was
expecting
complex
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
the
wood
is
very
present
with
toasty
nutty
malt
notes
a
little
alcohol
burn
and
some
vanilla
sweetness
very
light
body
and
drinkable
for
12
i
think
the
wood
gives
it
a
drier
finish
for
a
beer
this
big
strong
but
fantastic
pour
in
your
favorite
vessel
and
enjoy
note
this
is
best
fresh
as
the
vanilla
and
other
woody
characteristics
from
the
paraguayan
palo
santo
fermentation
tanks
is
noticeably
faded
after
6
months
see
bottle
date
on
the
neck
of
the
bottle
and
the
beer
becomes
unbalanced
and
overly
sweet
not
recommended
for
cellaring
despite
the
high
abv
and
wine
like
characteristics
unless
you
want
this
to
become
a
barley
wine
after
maybe
2
years
or
so
id
drink
fresh
myself
fantastic
maybe
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
its
a
shame
ive
past
this
by
so
many
times
thinking
i
wouldnt
enjoy
it
very
stupid
great
sipper
gets
much
deeper
as
it
warms
an
interesting
american
brown
ale
excellent
look
with
fine
head
not
much
aroma
perhaps
its
weakest
point
smooth
feel
and
smooth
taste
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
caramel
which
i
admit
i
am
partial
too
one
excellent
winter
warmer
with
a
good
book
salted
pretzel
and
warm
blue
cheese
dip
having
on
tap
at
the
malted
barley
right
now
super
dark
in
appearance
coffee
brown
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
smells
like
it
tastes
chocolate
slightly
tootsie
rollish
black
licorice
fruity
and
nutty
unless
you
like
a
good
buzz
dont
drink
more
than
3
great
beer
bottled
on
72114
served
at
55
degrees
poured
almost
completely
black
into
a
tulip
with
about
an
inch
of
creamy
khaki
head
that
dissipates
nice
and
slow
to
a
thick
film
smell
is
underwhelming
but
i
pick
up
fig
raisin
malty
sweetness
and
alcohol
medium
thick
and
creamy
mouth
feel
with
flavors
that
blend
so
well
its
difficult
to
single
out
any
one
in
particular
it
tastes
like
the
philharmonic
orchestra
sounds
definitely
hides
the
12
abv
well
but
to
me
this
seems
like
more
of
an
imperial
stout
someone
likened
this
beer
to
oskar
blues
ten
fidy
but
this
would
be
like
the
caramel
raisin
brother
to
the
chocolate
charred
coffee
that
is
the
ten
fidy
overall
this
excellent
beer
has
claimed
a
spot
in
my
top
5
cold
weather
beers
tastes
like
the
phantom
menace
of
deliciosity
black
viscous
and
boozy
with
a
brown
head
nominally
a
brown
ale
its
highly
reminiscent
of
ten
fidy
only
even
more
potent
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
very
malty
with
enough
sweetness
to
satisfy
my
wife
but
still
sufficiently
bitter
for
me
definite
vanilla
taste
dark
and
thick
a
very
rich
brown
ale
at
12
abv
one
ten
ounce
pour
is
enough
for
one
night
it
is
truly
a
unique
beer
and
the
wood
is
a
flavor
of
its
own
vanilla
and
barrely
boozy
flavors
follow
the
abv
will
get
you
on
this
one
if
i
drink
one
of
these
other
beers
become
not
as
necessary
its
worth
tasting
the
difference
slightly
cold
to
warm
holiday
dark
fruits
are
there
and
very
nice
i
havent
aged
this
one
and
i
wonder
how
it
would
do
dog
fish
heads
palo
santo
marron
is
outstanding
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
so
many
favors
this
brown
ale
has
an
earthy
taste
that
must
come
from
the
wooden
containers
it
is
aged
in
the
vanilla
comes
through
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
no
bitterness
and
even
though
it
has
a
high
abv
12
it
doesnt
taste
like
im
drinking
pure
alcohol
if
you
have
never
tasted
this
beer
take
my
word
for
it
its
worth
a
little
extra
this
is
an
excellent
beer
although
it
strikes
me
as
a
precurser
to
todays
spiced
stouts
than
a
brown
ale
really
really
excellent
brew
very
good
tasting
beer
with
strong
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
and
vanilla
it
has
a
pleasantl
alcohol
burn
finish
itll
make
you
smile
coming
in
at
a
whopping
12
abv
very
bold
taste
doesnt
give
me
the
feel
of
brown
ale
its
more
along
the
lines
of
barley
wine
the
flavor
is
so
intense
you
can
pick
out
some
vanila
and
coffee
flavors
it
will
knock
you
on
your
arrs
if
youre
not
carefull
gave
me
a
headache
i
think
its
the
wood
very
creamy
mouth
feel
almost
like
syrup
low
carbonation
great
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
evening
or
special
occasion
not
a
session
beer
just
a
slow
sipper
my
favorite
to
date
tastes
similar
to
a
delicious
stout
like
jo
oil
of
aphrodite
its
too
bad
this
beer
has
gone
unnoticed
for
so
long
great
winter
brew
taste
at
first
i
was
distracted
by
the
mouth
feel
being
very
thick
and
then
by
the
alcohol
as
it
warmed
up
i
got
notes
of
a
very
sweet
vanilla
and
caramel
after
tones
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
big
two
finger
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
is
nice
with
dark
fruit
vanilla
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
lots
of
booze
the
taste
is
also
lots
of
dark
fruit
vanilla
followed
by
dark
chocolate
and
some
coffee
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
masked
up
front
but
really
stands
out
in
the
back
end
along
with
some
nice
oaky
type
flavors
very
complex
but
nicely
balanced
with
no
one
flavor
overpowering
the
others
the
beer
has
a
mediumthick
mouthfeel
just
enough
to
linger
on
the
palate
nicely
overall
this
is
an
excellently
made
beer
very
complex
but
nicely
balanced
palo
santo
pours
a
black
color
with
a
nice
long
lasting
and
lacing
tan
head
there
is
a
strong
okay
aroma
with
whiskey
like
notes
the
taste
is
very
big
and
creamy
big
sharp
malt
backbone
good
hints
of
of
the
palo
wood
vanilla
and
a
whiskey
like
after
finish
good
strong
flavors
nice
body
overall
fantastic
nice
i
didnt
expect
this
had
it
on
tap
at
grill
next
door
in
haverhill
ma
a
personal
favorite
and
the
beer
that
sold
me
on
dogfish
head
o
a
big
bruiser
of
a
brown
ale
o
pretty
good
its
a
real
heavy
brown
id
say
it
is
somewhere
in
between
a
belgian
dubbel
clone
and
a
brown
ale
that
is
woody
really
nice
thick
brown
creamy
head
super
dark
nearly
black
the
aroma
is
super
complex
burnt
smokey
roasted
malts
some
sweetness
can
certainly
taste
the
uniqueness
of
the
wood
that
is
used
lots
of
smoked
malt
mild
bitrerness
really
fantastic
overall
couldnt
wait
to
try
this
one
and
my
high
expectations
were
blown
out
of
the
trub
gives
the
best
of
any
big
beer
a
of
any
type
a
run
for
its
money
without
succumbing
to
that
you
either
love
it
or
hate
it
description
most
beers
of
this
size
and
complexity
call
forth
just
a
tiny
touch
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
otherwise
its
superb
910
it
tastes
like
a
stout
poured
into
a
snifter
color
is
dark
black
with
almost
no
head
very
boozy
smell
kind
of
like
a
woody
whiskey
smell
most
alcohol
ive
ever
smelt
in
a
beer
oddly
and
delightfully
the
taste
isnt
boozy
at
all
nice
warm
taste
of
sweet
fruits
like
plum
raisin
and
caramel
too
would
have
given
it
a
10
for
taste
if
it
was
a
little
more
carbonated
but
i
understand
high
abv
beers
have
less
nice
warm
mouth
feel
makes
you
smile
when
you
sip
it
would
be
a
great
sit
in
front
of
the
fireplace
on
a
cold
day
kind
of
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
do
taste
the
vanilla
and
wood
quite
unique
could
see
drinking
it
to
cap
off
a
particularly
long
or
challenging
day
but
its
just
way
too
boozy
tasting
for
me
to
drink
casually
the
thought
of
having
two
in
a
row
makes
my
stomach
churn
smooth
subtle
caramel
flavors
with
smokey
wood
backbone
overall
a
tremendous
and
unique
beer
i
think
mine
is
fresh
and
it
expect
age
will
bring
out
softer
vanilla
flavors
and
tame
the
spicypeppery
flavors
and
hide
the
alcohol
better
packs
a
punch
thats
for
sure
really
smooth
going
down
which
is
suprising
for
12
im
a
fan
but
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
this
one
could
change
my
mind
really
tasty
i
think
ill
have
another
o
doesnt
know
whether
it
not
it
it
wants
to
be
a
brown
ale
or
an
imperial
but
either
way
its
delicious
o
tried
this
beer
a
few
months
ago
and
it
had
some
balance
issues
held
on
to
this
bottle
for
about
five
months
and
it
has
paid
off
handsomely
tons
of
flavor
imparted
by
the
wood
with
great
offsetting
bitterness
every
place
it
touches
the
tongue
gives
a
different
bit
of
flavor
an
excellent
beer
as
with
many
high
abv
beers
a
preferred
this
warmer
once
it
warmed
it
really
opened
up
and
presented
a
load
of
complexity
o
good
easy
drinking
scary
eh
overall
a
good
beer
i
feel
like
the
booze
will
mellow
with
some
aging
so
i
do
plan
on
aging
a
bottle
for
a
little
waiting
to
see
what
happens

its

tastes
and
its
the
end
of
the
night
but
its
very
good
overall
complex

flavorfull
also
unique
in
style
o
very
big
beer
i
have
enjoyed
world
wide
stout
and
120
but
this
one
is
too
big
for
me
the
alcohol
festers
in
the
back
of
your
throat
and
causes
an
overwhelming
burn
and
bitterness
not
for
me

i
had
trouble
finishing
a
bottle
picked
up
a
four
pack
of
this
for
my
birthday
poured
black
with
a
slim
mocha
head
into
a
chimay
goblet
and
looks
completely
frigging
awesome
nose
is
dark
fruit
supermalt
and
boozy
the
bottle
indicates
there
should
be
some
vanilla
and
caramel
notes
i
get
the
caramel
not
picking
up
on
the
vanilla
but
definitely
some
dank
wood
flavor
is
like
liquefied
raisin
and
boy
is
this
thick
so
good
and
the
vanilla
really
comes
through
in
the
flavor
maybe
as
its
warming
as
does
the
wood
giving
it
real
winelike
character
the
mouthfeel
as
i
said
is
thick
alcohol
level
is
up
there
with
a
wine
and
gives
a
similarly
tonguenumbing
sensation
and
low
carbonation
overall
completely
badass
now
going
to
chase
this
with
something
a
bit
lighter
i
honestly
cant
see
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
two
tops
awesome
awesome
beer
oa
bit
too
sweet
for
me
and
it
seems
to
be
more
a
stout
than
a
brown
ale
this
beer
could
benefit
from
a
more
roasty
malt
or
some
kind
of
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweetness
a
plus
for
this
beer
is
that
at
12
abv
there
is
a
low
alcohol
presence
which
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
sipper
76100
this
is
a
really
complex
beer
drinks
like
a
stout
for
sure
and
a
lot
is
going
on
in
these
12oz
the
12
abv
is
there
but
as
the
multiple
flavors
within
decide
to
take
turns
upstaging
each
other
the
burn
quickly
subdues
i
had
one
of
these
2
yrs
ago
when
i
got
the
4
ok
and
thought
it
was
overly
boozy
the
age
really
did
this
one
good
and
glad
i
have
another
left
to
enjoy
again
dfh
hit
the
mark
with
this
one
o
for
as
heavy
of
a
beer
as
this
is
the
finish
is
smooth
and
it
is
enjoyable
to
continue
sipping
i
could
see
having
two
or
three
bottles
of
this
back
to
back
no
problem
providing
i
wasnt
leaving
the
house
for
a
while
from
my
tasting
notes
it
pours
black
as
used
motor
oil
and
looks
and
tastes
like
an
imperial
stout
the
wood
aging
gives
it
a
bitter
but
complex
taste
that
hides
the
alcohol
well
it
had
a
thick
and
heavy
mouthfeel
that
lets
you
know
you
are
drinking
something
substantial
while
many
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
introduced
themselves
as
it
warmed
not
something
i
could
drink
all
the
time
but
a
dynamic
and
powerful
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
overall
somewhat
similar
to
bitches
brew
with
no
raisin
or
chocolate
very
tasty
wonderful
complex
heavy
sweet
sticky
winter
beer
had
this
beer
a
few
times
and
decided
to
do
full
review
beautiful
looking
beer
that
has
a
great
smell
the
smell
has
me
salivating
malty
and
rich
the
beer
is
not
quite
as
tasty
as
it
smells
which
is
perfect
but
is
outstanding
also
thick
and
smooth
bonus
points
for
the
abv
which
is
12
but
not
at
all
boozy
outstanding
beer
that
will
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
easily
one
of
the
most
interesting
experiences
on
the
palate
but
i
just
dont
like
it
fantastic
one
of
my
favorite
dfh
beers
pick
this
up
asap
and
try
it
o
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
there
is
nothing
really
to
compare
it
to
o
a
great
beer
i
dont
know
why
its
not
listed
as
a
stout
but
it
most
definitely
is
overall
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
dogfish
head
stays
true
to
there
out
of
the
box
brewing
and
created
another
wonderful
offering
for
anyone
looking
to
try
something
unique
go
grab
one
soon
its
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
snow
day
cheers
first
sip
is
glorious
definitely
taste
like
it
was
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
though
i
know
it
hasnt
you
also
get
hints
of
vanilla
as
well
mouthful
is
silky
smooth
it
strikes
a
perfect
balance
of
sweetness
and
and
roasty
bitterness
no
alcohol
burn
can
be
detected
as
this
beer
has
turned
almost
into
a
fine
liquor
with
age
again
completely
different
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
age
on
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
kbs
sans
the
coffee
overtone
shocked
the
hell
out
of
me
that
this
beer
got
this
good
with
the
age
on
it
this
has
turned
into
a
top
10
beer
all
time
for
me
just
wow
i
couldnt
stand
this
beer
normally
i
love
a
strong
dogfish
ipa
but
this
is
just
too
much
alcohol
which
is
overbearing
some
how
i
need
to
make
my
way
through
the
last
two
bottles
bought
some
blue
cheesecrackers
to
have
something
equally
as
sharp
to
be
able
to
offset
the
taste
a
bit
tasted
to
me
more
like
a
a
whiskey
or
something
i
will
say
that
its
big
but
i
cant
remember
having
a
imperial
porter
or
stout
with
the
depth
that
it
has
the
opal
color
and
rich
brown
lacy
head
make
an
excellent
presentation
on
the
front
end
you
experience
strong
wood
flavors
with
notes
of
licorice
and
prunes
then
you
go
through
a
warm
alcohol
mouth
feel
finishing
with
a
carmellike
chocolatecoffee
surge
from
what
seems
to
be
a
good
amount
the
darker
crystal
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
hoppiness
is
moderate
but
some
drinkers
could
confuse
the
complex
malt
profile
for
hop
bitterness
its
an
extremely
well
crafted
sipper
if
there
is
a
down
side
it
would
only
be
the
burn
from
a
12
abv
and
waiting
for
that
to
clear
to
experience
the
depth
and
complexity
worth
the
wait
thanks
for
a
unique
experience
sam
o
a
complex
brown
an
elegant
blend
of
oak
aged
sweetness
and
caramel
hops
delicious
classic
strong
wood
aroma
accompanied
by
oak
chips
alcohol
and
molasses
blackish
purple
appearance
with
a
fine
tan
foam
rim
intense
flavors
of
balanced
burnt
caramel
molasses
sweet
burnt
sugar
oak
maple
cinnamon
dates
figs
and
cherries
overall
this
is
incredible
simply
amazing
stuff
f
very
smooth
o
everything
i
could
have
expected
really
a
unique
brew
looks
so
much
like
a
good
stout
but
then
ends
up
being
more
saying
a
beer
is
perfect
is
saying
there
is
no
better
beer
anywhere
but
this
is
the
best
ive
ever
had
its
thick
and
chocolaty
with
a
bite
after
the
swallow
the
bite
is
almost
spicy
at
first
but
ultimately
confounded
my
taste
buds
the
12
abv
wastes
no
time
and
puts
me
into
a
nice
state
of
mind
that
after
all
is
what
beer
is
supposed
to
do
or
4
25
i
dont
know
if
i
would
call
this
an
american
brown
ale
it
definitely
has
a
more
double
like
quality
to
it
nice
beer
drink
it
slowly
overall
i
pulled
the
last
two
of
the
shelf
checked
the
dates
out
of
curiosity
and
said
why
not
glad
i
did
ill
have
to
try
it
fresh
some
day
to
see
if
its
the
same
but
almost
a
year
later
this
beer
held
up
quite
nicely
and
offered
a
fairly
unique
experience
when
it
comes
to
brown
ales
a
lot
of
things
that
are
aged
in
wood
barrels
have
just
a
hint
of
wood
this
thing
was
covered
in
it
it
was
a
great
beer
o
ive
always
found
this
to
be
a
very
big
beer
more
so
than
a
lot
of
other
1015ers
than
ive
had
the
alcohol
is
more
than
present
but
still
not
offputting
very
much
a
sipper
though
o
great
beer
not
really
a
normal
representative
of
the
style
but
representative
of
the
dogfish
head
creativity
cant
say
i
adored
it
but
it
is
a
very
solid
and
dry
good
thing
offering
on
its
own
merit
dfhs
reputation
for
sweetness
was
substantially
contradicted
been
wanting
to
try
this
and
glad
i
finally
did
certainly
a
brown
to
be
reckoned
with
this
is
a
big
brew
that
dfh
tackled
rather
uniquely
an
imperial
brown
for
beer
lovers
that
like
high
gravity
well
done
i
plan
on
aging
a
bottle
of
this
years
batch
o
do
yourself
a
favor
pick
up
a
fourpack
and
let
it
sit
for
a
year
wow
this
beer
really
shines
with
age
just
let
this
one
sit
dont
even
bother
with
it
fresh
the
cons
about
this
beer
is
that
its
around
12
to
14
dollars
for
a
4
pack
but
it
is
worth
it
by
being
so
good
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
stout
drinkers
barbeque
lovers
and
cold
nights
in
front
of
the
fireplace
o
a
solid
if
not
spectacular
brown
very
good
overall
could
have
been
a
big
hit
but
the
alcohol
is
simply
too
hot
i
think
it
would
be
better
with
the
alcohol
covered
up
a
bit
more
definitely
let
this
beer
warm
up
for
the
best
experience
o
excellent
beer
for
sure
very
drinkable
would
be
easy
to
put
away
a
few
of
these
which
at
12
might
be
selfcritiquing
later
well
worth
having
also
it
was
15
bucks
for
a
4
pack
next
time
i
want
to
share
a
brew
with
bill
gates
ill
bring
him
this
interesting
brew
very
complex
but
would
prefer
a
little
less
of
the
perfumey
and
floral
notes
good
dark
fruit
character
and
not
an
overpowering
roast
character
fairly
balanced
considering
amazing
to
get
two
different
beers
in
smell
and
taste
completely
masks
the
12
percent
great
beer
aged
or
not
o
took
a
chance
after
spotting
this
in
the
back
of
the
shelf
but
figured
this
type
of
brew
might
be
well
served
by
sitting
and
mellowing
for
a
while
im
a
fan
of
dfh
in
general
and
this
did
not
disappoint
one
of
the
most
drinkable
12
beers
ive
ever
had
o
very
unique
complex
beer
if
you
want
a
different
take
on
a
brown
ale
this
is
highly
recommended
i
cant
say
what
this
beer
tastes
like
fresh
but
i
imagine
its
a
bit
hot
this
which
a
year
and
a
half
of
age
on
in
is
really
really
good
there
really
isnt
much
to
compare
it
so
stylewise
but
this
drinks
more
like
an
imperial
stout
than
a
brown
ale
hopefully
i
can
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
this
though
because
its
really
good
dang
thats
all
i
know
to
say
definitely
not
a
regular
drinker
but
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
cornerstone
beers
for
both
dogfish
head
and
the
american
craft
scene
o
this
is
an
amazing
beer
that
has
improved
tremendously
with
age
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
fresh
but
will
have
to
keep
cellaring
them
away
to
achieve
this
wonderful
level
of
taste
great
job
dfh
o
if
you
can
find
this
beer
buy
it
dont
worry
about
the
cost
because
you
would
be
missing
something
truly
great
overall
the
appearance
of
this
creature
is
the
best
part
its
out
of
balance
from
that
point
forward
even
though
there
are
some
interesting
elements
the
expectation
for
more
is
what
lowers
my
overall
rating
despite
some
nice
components
ogreat
beer
it
was
very
satisfying
and
rich
i
highly
recommend
share
with
a
friend
because
the
alcohol
will
hit
pretty
hard
this
a
beer
that
continues
to
develop
in
the
glass
and
in
the
drink
its
smooth
and
yet
it
enlivens
the
palate
and
the
senses
it
grows
on
you
and
you
like
it
more
and
more
as
you
drink
the
flavors
are
deep
and
perfected
the
malt
in
this
is
superlative
it
flows
smoothly
as
the
flavors
become
unbounded
and
always
near
at
hand
worth
keeping
in
inventory
for
your
next
cigar
o
wow
what
a
surprise
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
have
no
doubt
this
will
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
youve
never
had
this
before
go
out
and
buy
some
now
for
the
price
availability
and
quality
you
have
no
reason
not
to
mmedium
to
thick
body
with
an
oily
feel
has
an
average
carbonation
with
a
long
finish
overall
i
would
characterize
this
beer
as
a
stout
it
feels
like
a
stout
and
it
tastes
like
a
stout
except
its
much
sweeter
it
looks
smells
feels
and
tastes
like
a
stout
this
is
by
far
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
i
did
not
write
this
while
drinking
overall
probably
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
obviously
dfh
tweaks
it
in
a
major
way
by
doubling
or
more
the
abv
level
from
a
traditional
american
brown
and
introducing
the
palo
santo
wood
but
it
still
has
enough
of
the
recognizable
brown
characteristics
o
a
gift
from
the
east
coast
friend
try
this
for
a
fresh
complex
take
on
the
venerable
brown
ale
o
a
strong
and
complex
sweet
dark
beer
would
make
a
very
pleasant
dessert
beer
reminds
me
of
a
russian
imperial
stout
like
old
rasputin
overall
awesome
brew
an
excellent
dessert
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
put
away
a
4
pack
in
one
sitting
i
feel
like
this
would
almost
be
better
off
as
a
bomber
or
750
regardless
this
is
a
smooth
sweet
beer
with
a
moderately
complex
and
very
nice
flavor
profile
hard
to
compare
it
to
beers
of
the
style
because
its
really
nothing
like
any
other
brown
ale
ive
had
but
great
all
around
overall
by
far
my
favorite
done
by
dfh
and
i
love
alot
of
the
work
they
do
this
is
just
brilliantly
done
from
beginning
to
end
and
at
12
i
have
no
idea
how
they
made
the
alcohol
completely
undetectable
must
get
for
anyone
overallcomments
i
thought
this
was
tremendously
good
another
great
original
concept
from
dfh
that
didnt
disappoint
a
big
beer
with
great
flavor
classified
as
an
american
brown
ale
12
abv
consumed
4172013
overall
what
a
cool
unique
beer
you
certainly
get
a
tiny
bit
of
the
hop
characteristics
of
a
brown
ale
but
with
a
much
thicker
mouthfeel
and
a
lovely
vanilla
tone
that
lasts
for
ages
this
is
a
seriously
great
beer
o
great
beer
than
i
really
enjoyed
ill
have
to
get
a
hold
of
more
some
day
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
some
of
this
up
because
it
is
very
tasty
thanks
to
deadonhisfeet
for
sending
to
me
o
the
12
abv
doesnt
bite
you
or
scare
you
off
its
tasty
its
well
disguised
for
how
high
it
is
but
ever
present
caught
me
off
guard
when
i
read
brown
ale
as
it
drinks
more
like
an
imperial
brown
or
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
overall
this
beer
is
awesome
definitely
not
sessionable
and
best
enjoyed
savored
over
a
decent
period
of
time
beastly
in
the
most
literal
of
senses
4
55
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
this
one
is
a
sipper
at
12
but
its
quite
easy
to
suck
right
down
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
4
pack
of
the
stuff
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
its
pricey
but
if
one
has
the
patience
to
age
this
beeri
really
like
it
overall
this
is
fantastic
just
over
a
year
on
it
and
tasting
good
as
ever
i
think
this
is
perfect
with
about
a
year
on
it
need
to
grab
some
more
to
age
for
next
year
o
a
home
run
of
a
beer
would
recommend
to
anybody
and
will
definitely
be
buying
more
myself
o
very
tasty
and
smooth
the
wood
is
quite
subtle
on
this
beer
and
not
overpowering
which
complements
the
other
flavors
nicely
o
not
really
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
im
digging
this
one
i
was
going
to
write
that
it
was
a
sipper
especially
with
the
high
abv
but
the
glass
is
already
halfempty
not
a
beer
that
i
would
go
back
to
often
but
it
is
solid
recommended
to
try
and
expand
what
you
think
a
brown
ale
can
be
i
believe
i
may
have
a
new
favorite
brown
notes
overall
a
very
complex
sweet
and
malty
beverage
enjoyable
sipper
aperitif
or
after
dinner
desert
beer
tasty
o
delicious
beer
i
had
this
years
ago
and
loved
it
i
still
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
not
something
youd
pick
up
every
day
but
its
damn
delicious
in
fact
i
might
grab
a
few
more
bottles
and
throw
them
in
the
cellar
for
a
few
years
because
why
not
buy
a
4
pack
drink
1
and
cellar
the
rest
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
definition
of
a
complex
american
style
barley
wine
very
unique
o
very
pleasant
to
sip
on
nice
appearance
and
a
good
bit
of
flavor
this
is
a
brew
id
certainly
return
to
and
its
quite
satisfying
as
brown
ales
go
really
dark
for
a
brown
ale
leaning
to
a
coffee
black
color
with
some
coffee
aroma
also
comes
out
of
the
bottle
beautifully
thick
and
viscous
with
a
very
thin
head
but
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
overall
definitively
some
taste
caramel
and
vanilla
the
bourbony
taste
of
alcohol
also
comes
out
strong
for
being
a
rich
beer
this
was
incredibly
smooth
it
pours
a
smooth
dark
brown
with
a
small
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
there
are
smells
of
wood
toffee
caramel
and
malt
the
taste
follows
with
a
rich
mouthfeel
yet
it
does
not
coat
the
mouth
many
flavors
present
themselves
but
in
such
a
well
balanced
manner
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
tried
and
is
a
testament
to
the
talent
of
the
dogfish
head
brewery
oreally
really
nice
beer
definitely
alot
going
on
thinking
about
picking
up
another
bottle
to
age
overall
one
of
my
favorite
dfh
brews
i
could
have
sworn
this
was
an
ris
a
solid
curve
ball
that
i
will
have
to
look
out
for
again
soon
a
winner
from
dogfish
head
one
of
the
strongest
browns
ive
ever
had
and
of
the
most
outthere
browns
as
well
definitely
one
to
grab
next
time
i
see
it
and
to
think
i
let
it
sit
on
the
shelf
for
so
long
overall
a
bit
over
the
hill
at
this
point
the
boozy
notes
have
mellowed
and
transformed
nicely
but
there
were
not
enough
residual
sugars
to
allow
this
guy
to
make
it
through
the
long
haul
id
guess
this
peaks
around
12
years
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
dogfish
head
currently
i
am
into
extremely
full
bodied
hefty
beers
and
this
definitely
fits
very
nicely

o
i
dont
love
this
beer
there
are
things
i
really
like
about
it
but
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
offputting
i
think
im
a
little
disappointed
because
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
im
putting
two
bottles
in
the
cellar
maybe
itll
improve
with
age
o
its
complex
and
a
very
tasty
sippin
brown
ale
i
cant
say
ive
ever
had
one
like
it
it
seems
to
be
more
like
an
imperial
stout
to
me
great
beer
overall
though
o
a
heavy
dark
beer
that
is
enjoyed
best
sipped
on
well
balanced
brown
ale
on
the
heavy
side
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
any
darkstout
beer
lovers
boozy
but
what
can
you
expect
with
12
abv
not
for
the
feint
of
heart
delicious
oa
great
ale
for
sipping
and
savoring
good
flavor
and
balance
o
a
beautiful
barrell
aged
beer
nice
havent
had
this
one
in
a
long
time
and
dont
know
why
very
underwhelmed
by
this
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
looks
like
an
imperial
stout
and
very
promising
the
aroma
is
that
of
a
spicy
coffee
porter
nice
but
no
complexity
and
barrel
character
the
taste
is
very
similar
kind
of
syrupy
chocolate
in
this
pretty
bitter
but
with
a
coffee
molasses
sweetness
feels
very
this
for
a
12abv
beer
amazingly
well
hidden
in
every
way
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
a
decent
one
that
left
me
wanting
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
do
a
challenging
strong
ale
this
beer
stands
out
because
it
is
an
extremely
highgravity
example
of
its
style
in
fact
it
forfeits
most
distinctive
brown
ale
qualities
instead
coming
across
as
interchangeably
baltic
porterimperial
russian
stout
it
is
not
an
especially
delicious
version
of
either
due
to
cloying
alcohol
and
acidity
that
diminishes
its
smoothness
smooth
taste
of
roasted
coffee
and
raisins
alcohol
after
taste
on
the
finish
medium
to
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
the
wood
imparts
an
unique
taste
which
is
quite
good
would
be
a
great
after
dinner
savor
it
by
the
fireplace
type
of
beer
flavors
of
dark
roasted
malts
dark
chcolate
bakers
chcoclate
subtle
espresso
cinnamon
and
rosemary
overall
very
satisfying
and
smooth
given
the
big

12
ounce
bottle

signature

bottled
on

almost

spotty

overall
this
is
an
excellent
imperial

very
nice

and
balance
of
flavors
and
quite
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
purchased
at
bevmo
gorgeous
to
look
at
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
looks
and
smells
much
like
an
imperial
stout
after
tasting
i
dont
think
id
call
this
a
brown
ale
imperial
all
the
way
in
my
opinion
smells
of
vanilla
touch
of
booze
taste
is
creamy
and
smooth
a
little
woody
definitely
barrel
aged
delicious
body
is
heavenly
lightly
carbonated
but
a
heavy
full
mouthfeel
booze
is
amazingly
hidden
for
12
abv
noticeable
still
but
well
masked
love
this
recommend
for
sure
simply
put
too
sweet
the
sweetness
many
times
overpowers
the
delicious
and
light
flavors
i
have
come
to
love
from
dogfish
head
o
i
have
passes
this
beer
for
a
long
time
not
realizing
how
great
it
was
i
hope
the
fresh
lives
up
to
the
vintage
but
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
i
seem
to
get
a
bit
of
coffee
typical
right
but
this
beer
has
really
aged
well
not
knowing
what
a
fresh
one
taste
like
gets
better
as
it
warms
and
is
everything
i
want
out
of
this
style
overall
drinks
much
closer
to
a
barleywine
than
it
does
a
brown
does
nothing
to
hide
its
boozy
nature
good
but
for
the
price
there
are
comparable
brews
id
rather
purchase
overall
i
am
liking
this
beer
with
some
age
its
not
perfect
but
there
are
some
good
things
going
on
appearance
was
great
a
great
dark
maroonishbrown
with
a
small
head
i
found
the
carbonation
to
be
just
a
bit
light
and
i
found
it
to
have
a
cloyingly
metallic
aftertaste
based
upon
the
6pack
i
bought
i
cannot
recommend
this
i
usually
really
like
dogfish
head
but
this
one
missed
the
mark
for
me
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
i
had
it
at
about
60
degrees
and
it
seemed
about
right
lots
of
flavors
that
i
enjoy
wellbalanced
welldone
gonna
have
to
add
this
to
the
haveagain
list
o
great
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
kudos
dfh
kudos
a
league
of
its
own
if
you
will
a
good
flavorful
big
ale
fruity
elements
add
a
uniqueness
and
a
balance
to
the
more
savory
sweetness
of
the
base
malts
hides
its
strength
well
enough
but
still
a
sipper
another
winner
from
dfh
o
a
top
notch
beer
but
i
was
expecting
the
wood
to
add
something
a
little
more
exotic
i
dont
really
know
if
i
notice
the
difference
between
this
and
just
typical
oak
but
perhaps
if
i
had
them
side
by
side
i
would
a
solid
brew
though
perhaps
my
expectations
were
a
little
too
high
pours
a
very
very
dark
brown
half
a
finger
of
dark
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
like
figs
or
raisins
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
has
a
smooth
woodvanilla
flavor
with
dark
fruit
and
a
warm
boozey
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
heavy
because
of
the
sweetmalty
nature
of
the
beer
the
heavy
mouthfeel
makes
it
seem
just
a
bit
syrupy
overall
a
very
impressive
beer
from
dfh
has
been
a
few
years
since
i
first
had
it
and
i
certainly
appreciate
it
more
now
a
well
deserved
beer
of
fame
a
really
good
ale
at
12
it
is
almost
too
easy
to
drink
o
overall
not
good
at
all
i
doubt
id
have
it
again
hard
pour
yields
no
head
but
at
a
hefty
12
i
wouldnt
expect
much
anyhow
you
defintiely
get
a
woodsy
vibe
in
the
aroma
im
not
sure
the
beer
needs
to
be
so
strong
but
it
is
rather
tasty
that
aging
process
really
gives
it
a
unique
character
its
sweet
but
balanced
and
you
feel
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
middle
thats
rather
nice
not
an
anytime
beer
but
one
to
try
obviously
poured
this
american
brown
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
midnight
black
color
produced
a
deep
tan
color
head
great
retention
and
left
an
outstanding
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
american
brown
ale
was
pleasing
full
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
malt
full
bodied
like
most
dogfish
offerings
this
american
brown
ale
was
heavy
on
roasted
malted
grain
that
super
malty
foundation
set
the
tone
for
the
rest
of
the
session
perfectly
balanced
there
are
not
alot
of
complex
flavors
in
this
brew
and
that
is
just
fine
with
me
its
everything
a
craft
american
brown
ale
should
be
heavy
on
the
malt
super
smooth
full
bodied
well
balanced
there
are
some
suggestions
of
caramel
and
vanilla
but
they
are
faint
i
cant
say
that
i
can
honestly
detect
the
palo
santo
wood
either
from
the
aroma
or
the
taste
but
i
also
wouldnt
know
the
aroma
or
its
flavor
if
it
were
right
in
front
of
my
face
in
this
case
i
will
just
chalk
up
the
san
palo
experience
to
this
this
is
a
damn
good
american
brown
ale
if
south
american
san
palo
wood
refines
this
beers
character
then
so
be
it
if
it
doesnt
it
is
at
least
a
great
story
and
exemplifies
all
that
dogfish
head
craft
brewing
is
about
off
centered
ales
for
off
centered
people
prost
o
wow
had
high
expectations
but
this
truly
floored
me
wonderful
a
medium
to
full
bodied
mouth
feel
with
a
soft
carbonation
is
this
the
best
brown
ale
in
america
if
not
its
close
huge
head
that
flowers
into
an
billowing
light
brown
cascade
of
foam
lots
of
lace
and
sticky
bits
it
fades
into
a
dark
brown
liquid
that
is
not
shy
about
the
alcohol
and
integrates
it
well
hefty
malt
body
massages
the
nose
with
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
as
well
cherries
and
oaken
vanilla
taste
is
thick
and
lush
a
bar
of
mocha
that
features
oaken
notes
of
cherry
and
vanilla
smooth
and
malty
with
a
sophisticated
bittering
that
gives
an
light
and
velvety
feel
with
a
big
og
that
drinks
superbly
superb
overall
luscious
thick
and
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
and
should
not
be
confused
with
other
brown
ales
american
english
or
otherwise
perhaps
this
is
really
a
porter
the
combination
of
malt
fermentation
and
hops
makes
for
a
very
good
beer
that
must
be
tried
to
be
understood
it
is
hard
to
know
where
one
component
ends
and
another
begins
the
mark
of
a
wellbalanced
beer
i
would
suggest
sharing
or
recapping
the
bottle
since
youll
want
to
sip
this
one
slowly
o
for
a
brown
ale
awesome
as
a
beer
overall
equally
awesome
and
impressive
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
was
black
in
color
with
no
light
visible
through
the
liquid
aroma
was
heavily
of
malty
with
chocolate
earthy
notes
taste
was
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
sweet
and
spicy
mouthfeel
was
full
bodied
like
a
stout
reminded
me
of
some
sweeter
english
stouts
aftertaste
was
sweet
and
lingering
seemed
to
leave
a
tingling
sensation
good
stuff
i
like
this
and
definitely
recommended
i
think
we
saved
this
beer
too
long
this
was
a
2008
bottle
despite
the
abv
the
beer
was
totally
skunked
last
year
this
was
still
a
great
beer
did
not
continue
to
age
well
very
disappointing
i
wish
we
had
reviewed
this
earlier
because
this
was
truly
a
great
beer
o
i
really
like
this
beer
its
extremely
flavorful
well
balanced
and
full
of
alcohol
i
will
definitely
be
buying
it
again
o
honestly
the
immense
sweetness
reminds
me
of
gi
bcs
but
unlike
bcs
it
is
not
as
well
balanced
and
it
lacks
the
bourbon
aspect
the
heat
is
felt
as
it
warms
the
lips
and
the
stomach
its
a
great
brew
the
palo
santo
wood
is
an
interesting
twist
but
i
honestly
dont
if
its
appealing
or
not
the
beer
just
glides
down
the
gullet
it
is
thick
and
oily
and
all
around
smooth
the
mild
carbonation
lends
itself
wonderfully
to
the
feel
it
lingers
on
the
palette
and
dries
it
out
leaving
a
nice
woody
aftertaste
o
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
and
one
i
always
look
forward
to
revisiting
o
this
is
an
interesting
brown
from
dfh
the
first
bottle
i
opened
took
some
getting
used
to
but
the
next
was
a
excellent
experience
for
me
most
of
dfh
is
a
bit
overrated
but
this
is
a
brew
that
is
done
very
well
i
think
this
will
be
fantastic
after
it
sits
awhile
in
the
cellar
which
ill
review
again
in
terms
of
american
brown
ale
this
is
one
of
the
best
and
has
a
bit
of
everything
for
the
snob
who
appreciates
complexity
and
a
unique
high
abv
brew
i
still
prefer
the
indian
brown
ale
personally
but
this
is
another
excellent
brown
from
dogfish
instant
must
have
nice
brownred
color
funky
little
beige
head
very
roasty
without
the
overly
burnt
notes
dark
cherryplumwoodsy
aroma
maybe
a
touch
of
vanilla
carried
through
in
the
taste
with
maybe
even
a
pleasant
hint
of
prune
and
other
dark
fruits
thought
it
quite
earthy
creamy
a
bit
thick
and
sticky
not
highly
carbonated
smokyoakywoods
flavor
great
drinking
beer
exceptionally
smooth
nice
sweetness
flavors
very
well
melded
and
balanced
the
abv
does
sneak
up
i
didnt
find
it
obvious
that
this
is
a
12
beer
o
this
is
a
great
beer
and
it
is
available
yearround
this
beer
is
a
style
onto
itself
it
has
the
sweetness
of
a
barleywine
combined
with
the
complexity
of
black
ale
the
malt
sweetness
and
the
vanilla
come
very
close
to
becoming
cloying
but
just
in
time
the
toasted
grain
wood
a
smooth
booziness
and
a
few
hints
of
dark
dried
fruit
join
in
to
add
balance
and
complexity
fans
of
sweeter
beers
should
put
this
n
their
must
try
list
dfh
really
nailed
it
with
this
one
o
an
awesome
beer
that
i
think
all
craft
beer
fans
should
try
in
their
lives
great
to
sip
on
a
nice
chilly
night
i
want
more
o
this
beer
is
incredible
theres
so
much
going
on
flavorwise
yet
its
so
easy
to
drink
and
the
high
abv
is
almost
nonexistent
no
doubt
this
is
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
i
would
say
this
is
probabley
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
dfh
delicious
overall
this
is
a
complex
sweet
woody
treat
more
complex
than
i
remember
it
being
but
i
need
to
try
a
fresh
one
the
spicy
wood
character
is
interesting
no
hops
noticeable
but
could
be
beneath
the
wood
and
spicy
not
too
sweet
nicely
done
makes
we
want
to
put
a
few
more
away
for
even
longer
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
in
my
life
just
enjoyed
it
again
what
a
nice
beer
very
deep
brown
bordering
on
black
with
a
great
reddish
brown
color
to
it
fair
retention
throughout
aroma
is
warm
with
hazelnut
chestnut
and
vanilla
a
faint
amount
of
caramel
comes
through
i
would
say
the
predominant
flavors
are
nutty
vanilla
like
some
smoke
and
bitter
chocolate
and
honey
alcohol
is
present
for
sure
especially
on
the
finish
full
bodied
to
match
the
full
flavor
but
finishes
well
and
is
nicely
attenuated
again
there
is
alcohol
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dogfish
head
beers
if
not
favorite
its
a
great
sipper
and
an
interesting
take
on
a
brown
ale
overall
dam
that
storm
bc
this
would
be
a
great
side
by
side
tasting
experience
psm
is
an
intriguing
brew
to
begin
with
i
believe
this
settled
down
nicely
ill
enjoy
it
a
memorable
storm
brew
o
yes
so
much
yes
i
dont
know
whats
going
on
with
this
ridiculous
wooden
barrel
that
is
larger
than
any
created
since
the
prohibition
i
dont
know
what
palo
santo
wood
actually
tastes
like
but
if
im
ever
on
vacation
and
a
tree
gets
pointed
out
to
me
ill
be
sure
to
take
a
nibble
but
i
do
know
a
glorious
beer
when
i
drink
one
and
ladies
and
gentleman
you
want
to
know
is
this
good
beer
well
in
response
to
your
question
i
have
a
question
myself
is
the
space
pope
reptilian
o
im
excited
to
age
my
remaining
bottles
but
in
the
meantime
im
pretty
disillusioned
im
actually
kind
of
surprised
that
this
is
a
regular
offering
from
dfh
o
definitely
an
extreme
example
of
the
style
could
be
confused
with
an
imperial
stout
offcentered
as
claims
dfhs
moto
excellent
drinkability
for
12abv
with
a
rare
complexity
of
aromas
and
flavors
i
just
love
this
brew
55
o
this
is
flat
out
original
big
alcohol
heavy
and
a
super
smooth
drink
this
beer
is
one
of
the
many
reasons
to
love
craft
beer
its
100
original
and
fantastic
not
what
id
want
to
drink
every
night
by
any
stretch
but
the
perfect
sip
for
a
cold
and
rainy
pacific
nw
evening
pours
an
opaque
super
dark
brown
almost
black
really
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
caramel
vanilla
slight
soy
sauce
wood
and
alcohol
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
and
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
has
some
nice
flavors
and
aromas
but
its
quite
strong
and
definitely
something
you
have
to
take
your
time
with
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
not
my
favorite
aba
but
it
packs
a
punch
and
tastes
really
good
dfh
has
better
offerings
but
at
a
whopping
12
this
can
work
up
a
nice
buzz
bottled
022211
poured
into
a
stone
irs
snifter
my
dogfish
glass
was
dirty
pours
basically
pitch
black
with
almost
no
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
nose
is
super
woody
with
notes
of
vanilla
figs
chocolate
heavy
roasted
malts
slight
booze
and
something
sticky
like
molasses
and
burnt
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
soooo
damn
smooth
i
havent
had
a
palo
santo
in
a
while
but
i
dont
remember
them
drinking
like
this
amazing
what
20
months
will
do
there
are
some
fruity
notes
right
up
front
like
dates
figs
and
maybe
some
plum
there
are
heavy
tones
of
wood
it
has
notes
of
burnt
sugar
dark
chocolate
raisins
booze
molasses
some
dark
cherries
and
vanilla
all
wrapped
up
with
a
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
finish
the
carbonation
is
really
low
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
surprisingly
light
for
this
beer
a
couple
of
years
took
an
already
amazing
beer
and
made
it
even
better
now
i
need
to
find
another
4
pack
and
put
them
away
for
even
longer
great
dessert
overall
an
incredibly
solid
brew
here
liked
it
very
much
d
why
havent
i
had
this
one
before
im
a
big
fan
more
brown
ales
should
be
like
this
o
nicely
ages
after
15
months
id
think
these
continue
to
age
nicely
and
i
will
continue
to
cellar
a
few
the
12
really
starts
to
show
about
23
of
the
way
through
the
beer
it
doesnt
kill
the
beer
but
makes
it
a
slow
sipper
complex
and
big
with
a
great
roasty
brown
ale
almost
strong
belgian
feel
d
not
easily
chugged
but
easy
to
drink
for
12
abv
for
sure
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
another
great
beer
from
dogfish
overall
dogfish
was
my
gateway
to
craft
beer
so
i
bought
up
everything
i
could
get
my
hands
on
this
happened
to
be
one
of
their
only
beers
i
didnt
particularly
like
so
after
drinking
3
bottles
i
stashed
the
last
one
away
until
now
i
remember
specifically
not
liking
the
flavor
the
wood
gave
to
the
beer
but
now
its
fairly
subdued
with
four
years
on
it
it
resembles
more
of
a
barley
wine
or
old
ale
than
a
brown
ale
unfortunately
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
dark
fruit
flavors
in
my
beers
so
it
wasnt
really
for
me
although
im
sure
many
others
would
really
enjoy
it
overall
super
solid
brown
ale
if
it
put
into
that
category
this
beer
is
definitely
in
a
league
of
its
own
many
have
been
enjoyed
in
the
past
and
more
in
the
future
overall
excellent
beer
if
you
like
an
aged
beer
drink
it
slow
though
i
cant
imagine
anyone
wanting
to
take
big
gulps
bought
a
single
of
this
already
bought
another
pack
overall
pretty
boozy
but
it
is
nice
and
warming
and
has
some
wonderful
flavors
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
a
brown
ale
eh
call
it
what
you
will
but
this
is
thicker
richer
roastier
and
more
complex
than
a
lot
of
stouts
out
there
im
a
dogfish
head
skeptic
but
this
is
some
mighty
fine
work
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
will
definately
buy
drink
this
again
and
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
ages
i
must
say
this
is
a
very
interesting
tasting
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
the
same
tastes
that
other
barrel
aged
beers
have
but
this
one
has
its
own
little
twist
it
is
so
much
like
a
wine
in
taste
and
smell
but
it
does
still
keep
its
beer
profile
just
a
very
interesting
twist
on
a
beer
and
something
i
think
you
should
seek
out
and
try
for
yourself
overall
a
great
offering
from
dogfish
filling
well
rounded
delicious
big
ass
like
an
ris
heard
that
before
im
sure
brown
still
prevails
brown
sugar
and
root
beer
candy
bigass
malts
black
malts
licorice
chalky
malt
whoppers
dark
fruits
big
wood
slightly
tart
and
a
hint
of
metal
creamy
hearty
oatmealy
booze
is
hidden
well
good
thing
its
a
tad
filling
because
this
thing
at
12
could
get
out
of
hand
o
the
alcohol
lets
you
know
its
there
but
you
still
might
not
think
its
12
abv
overall
a
very
very
nice
beer
i
liked
it
more
than
i
anticipated
dogfish
really
is
one
of
the
most
consistent
breweries
in
the
us
definitely
the
best
i
have
tasted
from
dfh
so
far
in
my
opinion
o
another
impressive
beer
that
i
hope
to
age
in
the
future
to
see
how
the
complexity
deals
with
time
all
factors
accounted
for
this
beer
is
brilliant
this
is
a
very
heavy
beer
and
within
a
few
sips
you
start
feeling
it
a
wonderful
sweet
treat
but
you
have
pace
yourself
not
to
drink
it
too
fast
since
its
so
sweet
and
delicious
final
thoughts
i
was
really
lucky
to
get
my
hands
on
this
one
as
we
dont
get
dfh
in
mn
the
signature
glass
was
also
well
worth
the
purchase
for
enjoying
this
brew
highly
recommend
this
one
drinkability
a
super
sipper
great
fresh
or
aged
this
is
a
dfh
winner
overall
this
is
the
best
brown
i
have
ever
tasted
it
just
seems
to
have
more
well
brownness
to
it
than
any
other
brown
ive
had
although
i
havent
tasted
too
many
aged
browns
certainly
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
overall
fresh
its
harsh
but
tasty
a
year
might
really
help
this
beer
in
typical
dogfish
head
fashion
its
aggressive
a
little
bit
messy
and
hot
it
works
just
glad
i
only
purchased
a
single
and
didnt
pony
up
the
dough
for
the
full
4pack
o
well
not
at
all
what
i
anticipated
im
trying
to
review
it
as
a
brown
ale
not
just
a
beer
and
ive
never
had
a
brown
ale
this
dark
and
dense
id
say
its
a
good
beer
but
a
little
bit
heavier
than
id
expected
i
might
have
scored
it
differently
higher
if
it
were
a
double
stout
or
even
a
black
ale
hides
the
12
abv
pretty
damn
well
this
is
a
huge
malty
monster
of
a
brown
ale
the
palo
santo
wood
is
apparent
and
tastes
like
cedar
covered
in
fresh
saw
dust

a

a
complex
and
very
interesting
brown
ale
o
ive
heard
of
porters
that
think
theyre
stouts
but
a
brown
ale
that
thinks
its
an
imperial
stout
in
its
current
state
its
pretty
enjoyable
but
still
too
young
and
hot
this
could
become
great
with
a
year
of
age
and
its
readily
availablecheapish
enough
for
what
it
is
154
pack
isnt
chump
change
to
make
picking
up
a
4
pack
to
age
a
worthy
endeavor
o
so
what
if
the
srm
is
off
the
scale
for
a
brown
ale
dfh
consistenly
pushes
the
envelope
and
this
is
a
great
example
so
many
ways
this
could
go
wrong
but
it
doesnt
a
good
one
to
offer
to
nonbeer
lovers
as
an
example
of
what
great
beer
can
taste
like
mouthfeel
is
all
right
full
body
mild
soft
carbonation
long
semisweet
finish
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
very
expensive
and
i
may
not
get
it
again
but
it
is
worth
trying
this
is
not
your
fathers
brown
ale
this
is
something
else
altogether
in
a
very
very
good
way
update
i
tried
a
second
bottle
the
day
after
and
this
time
noted
some
additional
nuttiness
its
possibly
that
i
missed
it
because
of
the
lower
temperature
i
had
it
at
the
first
time
this
is
just
an
awesome
complex
beer
i
think
im
going
to
age
the
other
two
and
see
how
they
taste
several
months
from
now
o
love
this
beer
for
me
this
resembles
a
stout
more
than
a
porter
i
suppose
it
shares
elements
of
both
looking
forward
to
obtaining
more
for
aging
o
im
not
huge
on
dfh
but
this
is
great
my
only
problem
with
it
is
the
price
i
cant
see
myself
buying
this
again
soon
for
that
reason
alone
if
it
were
cheaper
it
would
be
a
staple
for
me
very
nice
woody
brown
ale
pours
a
thick
obviously
opaque
brown
with
very
little
head
the
smell
is
that
of
home
depot
or
a
cedar
tree
very
woody
i
like
that
but
ill
admit
its
a
bit
excessive
but
thats
just
the
smell
the
taste
is
fantastic
the
wood
is
present
in
appropriate
amounts
to
add
some
serious
complexity
to
what
is
otherwise
normal
boring
unfiltered
brown
ale
the
unfiltered
brown
backbone
of
this
is
not
something
im
generally
a
fan
of
i
feel
like
the
thick
oiliness
of
the
lack
of
filtering
can
actually
hurt
the
flavour
of
a
brown
ale
sometimes
by
making
it
too
thick
and
masking
flavours
that
can
present
themselves
in
a
thinner
concoction
however
this
particular
ale
is
fantastic
it
takes
that
thick
brown
malty
ale
with
all
the
stuff
a
beer
can
have
crammed
into
it
and
it
adds
a
nice
woody
texture
to
make
it
a
very
interesting
beer
sadly
the
unfiltered
yeast
covers
up
a
lot
of
the
alcoholic
bite
that
should
be
present
in
a
12
beer
but
most
people
reading
this
will
probably
like
that
its
still
got
enough
bite
to
keep
me
interested
but
it
is
very
disguised
so
be
prepared
to
be
hit
hard
the
complexity
here
is
not
as
amazing
as
a
good
quad
or
a
samichlaus
but
its
not
far
off
i
will
continue
to
be
enticed
by
anything
aged
in
wood
such
beers
have
yet
to
disappoint
me
this
is
pretty
much
a
stout
with
dark
brown
almost
black
pour
and
a
light
brown
half
finger
head
aroma
of
roasted
grain
dirt
and
some
light
chocolate
notes
taste
is
bitter
chocolate
with
serious
booze
on
the
back
end
warming
going
down
and
nicely
integrated
a
strong
sipper
but
very
nice
with
roast
light
wood
and
chocolate
full
bodied
medium
carbonation
and
crazy
strong
for
a
brown
ale
a
pretty
awesome
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thumbs
width
mocha
head
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
stout
very
noticeable
alcohol
in
the
aroma
roasted
malt
chocolate
wood
and
some
burnt
sugar
quite
a
bit
of
heat
to
this
one
that
flows
into
some
nice
sweetness
of
vanilla
theres
some
woodiness
and
some
sugared
breadiness
not
much
activity
a
nice
fuller
body
overall
there
was
clearly
no
effort
made
at
hiding
the
alcohol
making
this
a
definite
sipper
to
slowly
enjoy
throughout
the
night
lots
of
great
flavors
alongside
the
alcohol
though
making
this
beer
a
definite
winner
o
dogfish
head
is
just
so
damn
unique
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
including
a
bottle
that
was
about
3
years
old
i
think
i
prefer
it
fresh
so
much
is
happening
and
the
aroma
is
just
perfect
and
so
enticing
world
class
example
of
breaking
the
mold
in
the
beer
world
one
awesome
brew
probably
my
favorite
from
dfh
this
is
like
an
amped
up
version
of
palo
with
more
robust
vanilla
notes
and
the
addition
of
roast
coffee
to
the
mix
highly
enjoyable
fusion
of
new
flavors
overall
really
good
brew
this
is
the
first
imperial
brown
ive
tried
so
i
was
hesitant
to
give
this
a
5
but
with
every
sip
i
was
reassured
a
sipper
for
sure
pretty
cool
to
read
about
what
sam
did
in
order
to
get
this
out
to
us
efforts
alone
make
this
worth
while
pretty
good
but
the
taste
really
brings
it
down
the
alcohol
really
dominates
and
i
feel
the
more
subtle
flavors
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
spectacular
i
had
this
in
the
summer
i
have
to
get
more
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
curl
up
in
front
of
a
fire
on
christmas
o
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
you
would
be
better
off
sipping
it
you
can
more
greatly
appreciate
the
subtly
of
the
flavors
and
the
high
abv
will
really
sneak
up
on
you
otherwise
there
is
some
light
alcohol
hints
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
you
might
expect
from
this
strong
a
beer
not
sessionable
reel
ahead
6
months
later
i
finally
got
up
the
nerve
to
pull
another
one
of
these
out
of
my
storage
closet
shazam
what
a
wonderful
smell
mouthfeel
and
aftertaste
molasses
scent
black
licorice
flavor
and
the
aftertaste
is
difficult
to
describe
perhaps
because
i
constantly
want
to
try
another
sip
chewy
comes
to
mind
but
not
quite
accurate
because
its
not
thick
incredible
flavors
and
i
love
the
mouthfeel
foamy
rich
and
chocolatey
overall
the
booze
are
well
hidden
this
one
is
actually
well
balanced
i
think
the
wood
cleans
this
one
up
and
smooths
it
up
ps
i
love
you
overall
im
very
impressed
with
this
and
this
is
definitely
the
best
brown
ale
i
have
ever
tried
o
really
nice
beer
would
drink
again
in
a
heartbeat
o
i
was
expecting
a
good
beer
and
it
still
surprised
me
how
good
this
one
is
its
got
a
lot
of
nice
flavors
that
will
probably
improve
with
age
an
impressive
beer
and
my
new
favorite
dogfish
o
its
an
ok
blend
kind
of
port
wineish
interesting
and
solid
but
not
my
style
overall
rather
interesting
certainly
worth
a
try
poured
into
a
10
oz
snifter
glass
pours
s
deep
dark
brown
with
a
huge

the
smell

roasted
malts

notes
of
the
wood
barrels
and
vanilla
taste
is
strong
roasted
malts
mild
wood
notes
and
a
nicely
balanced
hop
spice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
overall
a
decent
beer
but
far
from
dfhs
best
o
this
beer
pushes
the
limits
of
a
brown
ale
i
should
know
better
with
dogfish
head
but
is
definitely
tasty
kudos
to
dogfish
head
for
barrelaging
a
beer
other
than
a
stout
or
a
sour
you
know
its
different
as
soon
as
you
pour
it
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
due
to
the
presence
of
alcohol
throughout
i
bought
another
bottle
for
my
friend
who
loves
brown
ales
and
i
have
a
feeling
ill
have
to
give
him
a
headsup
before
he
cracks
this
one
open
this
seems
like
a
nice
introduction
to
barrelaged
beers
for
him
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
for
a
12
abv
beer
although
it
smelled
a
little
bitter
it
tasted
great
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
a
big
surprise
d
very
drinkable
different
and
excellent
take
on
a
big
brown
ale
i
like
the
smoke
and
wood
flavors
in
the
beer
with
the
complexity
of
the
rest
of
the
flavors
overall
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
quite
the
sipper
its
good
but
its
a
bit
too
boozy
and
quite
expensive
definately
worth
a
shot
but
ill
stick
to
dfhs
indian
brown
ale
o
slow
drinker
some
nice
things
about
it
but
too
sweet
and
not
balanced
enough
worth
having
here
and
there
but
not
all
that
often
i
actually
had
this
beer
a
couple
years
ago
but
didnt
have
the
same
appreciation
for
these
types
of
offerings
at
the
time
i
can
definitely
say
this
will
now
be
another
addition
to
my
beer
cellar
original
reviewed
on
07192010
o
this
beer
still
has
quite
a
bit
of
heat
after
being
laid
down
over
two
years
burnt
sugars
are
really
pronounced
the
palo
santo
wood
may
have
faded
some
very
interesting
beer
from
dfh
drinkability
quite
nice
an
i
wasnt
really
feeling
or
expecting
the
12
which
they
balance
quite
well
kudos
dogfish
head
this
is
a
good
beer
and
probably
my
favorite
from
dogfish
head
i
dont
always
like
their
experiments
but
this
palo
santo
wood
was
a
good
move
it
tastes
more
like
a
porter
or
stout
than
a
brown
ale
and
its
like
your
typical
barrelaged
offeringsbut
only
kind
of
pretty
solid
beer
that
is
expensive
but
fun
to
drink
rich
deep
mocha
head
with
elegant
lacing
dark
cocoa
appearance
a
bit
weak
in
the
nose
but
very
pleasant
hints
of
caramel
and
wood
satinlike
mouthfeel
with
a
mild
coffee
finish
an
ever
so
subtle
booziness
that
is
common
with
dh
overall
another
outstanding
beer
from
dogfish
head
taste
is
awesome
which
is
why
i
bought
it
honestly
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
the
earthy
coffee
thick
bold
flavor
is
worth
every
penny
will
finish
updating
later
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
a
little
gritty
somewhere
between
stout
and
brown
ale
overall
this
is
a
surprising
and
good
beer
they
go
to
the
extent
to
explain
that
they
are
very
excited
about
this
beer
and
its
woody
housing
and
that
that
are
bearers
of
such
wood
its
all
very
exciting
we
have
wood
now
you
do
too
always
a
classy
presentation
all
in
all
a
very
delicious
beer
definitely
one
to
look
out
for
o
a
robust
imperial
american
brown
clocking
in
at
12
abv
leave
it
to
dfh
to
corral
the
chaos
a
deep
sipper
this
would
go
really
well
with
a
blackened
angus
burger
topped
with
stilton
a
flourless
chocolate
torte
or
a
smoky
selection
from
the
humidor
this
versatile
oakaged
beauty
is
bets
suited
to
be
sipped
and
analyzed
on
its
own
though
o
def
a
very
enjoyable
beer
bit
on
the
heavy
side
so
its
more
of
a
beer
id
drink
after
a
meal
or
with
a
good
dessert
while
relaxing
would
def
drink
again
and
def
like
to
try
it
on
tap
dfh
boys
impress
me
yet
again
o
reminds
me
more
of
an
imperial
stout
but
who
cares
about
names
this
is
an
amazingly
robust
and
complex
ale
worth
every
penny
especially
at
12abv
if
you
like
a
complex
sipper
of
a
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
check
this
one
out
overall
not
my
favorite
dogfish
brew
but
not
bad
you
have
to
understand
what
they
try
to
do
and
go
with
it
off
centered
ales
for
off
centered
people
worth
a
try
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
o
nothing
too
special
had
this
beer
a
few
times
but
the
taste
and
alcohol
presence
doesnt
excite
my
palate
i
probably
wont
try
this
again
unless
its
aged
at
least
a
few
years
overall
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
dfh
offering
looking
forward
to
the
second
one
i
have
aging
in
a
few
months
to
a
year
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
almost
jet
black
with
a
tall
light
fluffy
brown
head
aromas
are
subtle
with
caramel
and
vanilla
highlights
and
some
woody
characteristics
flavors
are
booze
forward
with
a
hard
roasted
backbone
to
balance
and
a
blast
of
vanilla
and
oak
throughout
the
palate
heavy
hitter
for
a
brown
but
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
the
aftertaste
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
light
with
a
touch
of
booze
and
some
nutty
sweetness
clean
slick
finish
that
has
a
touch
of
drying
from
the
increased
abv
easy
enough
to
drink
that
you
could
get
into
some
trouble
overall
a
damn
good
beer
rich
and
delicious
but
i
like
the
bottled
version
so
much
better
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
dark
beige
two
and
half
finger
head
the
smell
of
wood
light
roasted
malt
and
subtle
dark
fruitiness
are
present
fig
and
plum
with
a
bit
of
wood
on
the
nose
transitioning
to
toasty
malt
and
boozy
slightly
sweet
syrup
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
finish
is
dry
with
malt
and
warm
booze
exceptional
mouthfeel
gentle
but
abundant
carbonation
which
blankets
the
inside
of
the
mouth
very
fullbodied
really
an
extremely
original
and
very
enjoyable
brew
overall
impression
while
the
drinkability
of
this
one
is
poor
able
to
enjoy
over
a
long
period
of
time
and
really
get
all
the
characteristics
within
wish
there
was
more
of
a
burnt
flavor
and
more
hops
included
very
strong
and
tough
to
finish
would
definitely
like
to
age
a
bottle
of
this
update
on
32113
had
another
bottle
from
the
same
4pack
bottled
on
date
of
2212
drinking
over
1year
later
smells
more
cherrylike
a
tad
sour
with
notes
of
wood
oil
brown
sugar
molasses
and
pine
tar
has
some
solventy
alcohol
roast
char
seems
evident
tastes
like
a
full
vinous
dark
mother
of
a
brew
competes
with
any
ris
still
tastes
good
developing
interesting
complexities
but
i
wish
i
had
aged
this
one
for
at
least
2
more
years
my
opinion
hasnt
changed
much
with
the
palo
santo
marron
but
theres
no
doubt
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
especially
since
its
classified
as
a
brown
ale
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
that
i
think
the
booze
intrudes
on
it
a
bit
too
much
still
its
delicious
and
a
beer
id
recommend
everyone
try
at
least
once
a
wonderful
beer
quite
intense
and
a
slow
sipper
my
favorite
from
dogfish
12oz
bottle
pours
dark
chestnut
with
an
oily
but
creamy
tan
head
that
holds
good
retention
given
the
massive
abv
and
leaves
some
chunky
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
oaky
with
vanilla
caramel
brown
sugar
molasses
and
a
nose
full
of
booze
tastes
are
boozy
up
front
and
tremendously
sweet
with
complex
notes
of
burnt
brown
sugar
caramel
oak
palo
santo
wood
but
it
resembles
oak
vanilla
and
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
boozy
enough
to
leave
a
peppery
prickle
on
the
tongue
overall
this
has
always
been
a
favorite
of
mine
always
love
going
back
to
it
every
once
in
awhile
it
is
a
sipper
and
can
be
cloyingly
sweet
at
times
but
still
very
enjoyable
i
aged
this
beer
for
2
5
years
and
it
was
awesomeso
my
rating
for
the
2
5
year
aged
brew
is
4
5
this
truly
was
good
with
a
ton
of
aging
otherwise
its
a
decent
brew
o
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
offering
from
dfh
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
a
top
notch
combo
of
sweet
woody
fruity
and
chocolatey
i
cant
think
of
another
beer
with
this
abv
that
goes
down
quite
as
smooth
as
this
it
is
a
bit
pricey
but
i
suppose
that
is
the
cost
for
such
a
unique
barrel
aged
brew
bonus
points
for
the
groundbreaking
vessels
they
made
to
age
this
brew
i
dont
give
dfh
as
much
credit
as
they
deserve
but
they
continue
to
impress
me
with
great
beers
when
i
am
looking
for
a
delicious
smooth
sipping
beer
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
palo
santo
marron
i
highly
recommend
it
o
i
was
extremely
impressed
by
this
brew
straddles
the
line
between
an
imperial
stout
and
a
strong
brown
with
the
wood
and
alcohol
integrated
very
well
alcohol
is
extremely
wellhidden
for
12
and
when
it
comes
out
its
for
the
better
best
dfh
beer
ive
had
o
a
big
and
delicious
beer
complexity
is
outstanding
in
this
beer
and
it
is
really
quite
a
challenge
to
nail
down
exactly
what
is
going
on
i
think
i
couldnt
even
do
it
o
a
very
innovative
and
tasty
beer
not
something
i
can
drink
more
than
1
of
in
a
session
can
i
even
finish
this
one
but
very
interesting
and
something
everybody
should
try
at
least
once
this
beer
is
off
the
charts
and
by
far
the
best
new
beer
ive
had
in
the
past
many
months
almost
a
dessert
beer
this
smooth
and
creamy
beer
doesnt
give
away
its
high
alcohol
content
via
flavour
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
caramelmalty
character
o
a
great
strong
beer
very
enjoyable
to
drink
nice
strong
flavors
and
a
unique
head
othis
is
balanced
very
well
with
the
the
alcohol
in
it
very
nice
mix
for
a
brown
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
delicious
wouldnt
mind
having
this
regularly
im
rarely
disappointed
with
dogfish
head
and
this
beer
falls
nicely
into
their
current
lineup
of
great
beers
o
an
amazing
ale
very
unique
with
its
woody
flavor
really
wish
this
was
available
here
in
wisconsin
would
definitely
drink
again
overall
great
beer
even
though
its
not
really
a
brown
ale
close
to
a
porter
or
thin
stout
overall
this
is
an
amazing
heavy
beer
dont
choose
this
before
going
out
because
you
might
just
want
to
stay
in
o
bold
flavor
strong

with
hints
of

remember

it

for

no

a
great
beer
to
sit
and
sip
on
throughout
the
evening
o
definitely
coming
back
for
more
here
o
i
get
this
one
at
the
brew
pub
in
rehoboth
all
the
time
because
its
one
of
my
favorites
this
beer
is
so
flavorful
it
gives
me
wood
chips
deep
down
in
my
soul
received
in
a
grade
with
slvrmon82
reviewed
from
notes
pours
a
very
deep
brown
almost
black
color
body
is
the
beer
is
very
thick
as
i
cant
see
much
through
it
head
is
tan
stands
34in
tall
after
a
fairly
aggressive
pour
retention
isnt
great
but
that
is
to
be
expected
smell
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
vanilla
roasted
malts
taste
is
relatively
comples
from
the
malts
i
get
a
nice
smooth
sweetness
i
also
get
some
dark
fruit
vanilla
woody
flavors
i
can
taste
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
but
wouldnt
have
guessed
that
this
was
12
body
is
thick
with
subtle
carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
pretty
drinkable
considering
how
big
it
is
really
a
great
beer
to
share
with
a
friend
o
typical
dfh
beer
they
stress
the
uniquie
crazy
palo
santo
wood
but
it
really
only
adds
a
nice
complexity
to
a
wellcrafted
balanced
beer
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
present
for
me
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
feel
like
i
drank
this
beer
a
little
green
and
it
will
only
improve
with
age
final
thought
12
abv
nice
3
price
and
may
i
please
have
more
low
smooth
carbonation
with
roasted
malt
and
peat
aftertaste
the
depth
of
flavor
on
this
is
admirable
overall
an
awesome
brew
looks
great
smells
great
tastes
great
would
definitely
drink
again
and
would
enjoy
trying
some
with
a
little
more
age
i
would
gladly
have
this
again
i
declare
delish
b
nice
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
its
one
of
my
favorites
from
dfh
as
said
above
it
looks
and
drinks
more
like
an
imerial
stout
very
surprising
that
its
labeled
as
a
brown
ale
o
i
like
this
beer
but
was
somewhat
disappointed
that
the
unique
wood
that
it
is
aged
with
doesnt
come
through
as
much
as
i
was
expecting
it
tastes
similar
to
imperial
stouts
that
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
very
fine
brown
ale
or
perhaps
more
appropriately
akin
to
a
rich
stout
good
job
dogfish
overall
you
need
this
beer
in
your
life
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
but
demonstrates
overall
excellence
i
could
probably
just
smell
it
for
an
hour
i
need
to
get
some
of
this
wood
that
its
aged
on
temp
49f
but
is
definitely
excellent
regardless
o
such
a
great
sweet
and
woody
beer
delicious
stuff
very
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
o
good
beer
but
booozy
tasting
but
for
12
what
do
you
expect
pretty
good
tasting
wood
taste
added
to
it
makes
it
unique
caramel
come
forth
not
so
much
vanilla
maybe
a
hint
overall
a
great
brown
ale
a
bit
thick
which
i
like
but
excellent
all
the
same
its
a
bit
expensive
but
i
would
buy
it
again
wellcrafted
complex
beer
this
is
one
that
everyone
should
try
o
lots
of
flavors
coming
in
here
with
not
one
being
a
total
front
runner
this
is
a
great
brew
that
im
definitely
going
to
seek
out
again
overall
great
beer
interesting
to
see
how
it
ages
poured
into
a
20
oz
tulip
aggressively
pours
the
darkest
brown
ever
with
a
huge
3
inch
head
that
slowly
settles
into
a
nice
eighth
of
inch
of
thick
foam
with
very
attractive
minimal
amount
of
lace
smell
is
pungent
vanilla
burnt
brown
sugar
prunes
molasses
and
booze
taste
is
not
as
powerful
as
smell
huge
vanilla
wood
and
alcohol
are
most
dominant
body
is
massive
like
no
brown
ale
i
have
ever
had
good
amount
of
carbonation
for
large
abv
not
overly
dry
and
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
this
is
a
beast
but
very
unique
and
really
a
special
beer
dont
let
the
first
sniff
scare
you
off
because
not
nearly
as
scary
as
the
first
impression
a
fairly
good
and
pretty
strong
beer
my
only
beef
with
it
is
the
cost
but
i
dont
regret
paying
for
it
since
theres
enough
alcohol
to
keep
you
happy
for
a
while
overall
not
what
i
thought
it
would
be
if
i
had
not
seen
the
bottle
i
would
have
not
known
the
level
of
abv
by
taste
dangerously
wellcovered
by
lots
of
great
flavors
and
depth
appearance
is
lacking
but
taste
is
what
matters
and
this
brews
got
it
pretty
much
everything
i
want
in
brown
ale
overall
i
wasnt
sure
how
this
would
be
going
into
it
due
to
the
abv
however
there
is
so
much
flavor
that
comes
through
and
many
different
layers
the
wood
flavor
combined
with
the
sweet
caramel
and
the
bittersweet
chocolate
are
a
great
balance
highly
recommend
this
overall
this
really
impressed
me
very
good
beer
notes
medium
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
solid
sipping
beer
surprisingly
ive
never
reviewed
this
beer
fresh
well
ill
try
to
fix
that
someday
soon
o
very
interesting
beer
definitely
not
an
all
occasions
beer
this
is
meant
to
be
drunk
slowly
and
to
be
savored
i
like
it
its
not
exactly
what
i
thought
it
would
taste
like
when
it
said
made
with
brown
ale
base
but
it
was
tasty
and
powerful
thanks
to
donnie
bb
on
the
trade
pours
a
gooey
thick
vicious
black
into
my
chalice
darkest
brown
ale
on
earth
very
small
head
with
minor
lacing
smell
is
not
the
most
prominent
feature
of
this
ale
but
the
taste
is
great
nice
and
woody
and
malty
flavor
with
sweetness
like
maple
or
honey
smoothing
the
throat
very
nice
mouthfeel
very
thick
like
eating
a
meal
overall
a
great
version
of
brown
ale
but
dont
try
to
session
this
two
beers
is
like
polishing
off
a
bottle
of
wine
on
your
own
cheers
this
is
solid
for
its
class
overall
i
cant
believe
ive
gone
this
long
without
picking
this
beer
up
i
will
definitely
be
getting
some
more
to
throw
in
the
closet
to
see
how
it
continues
to
do
with
some
time
on
it
due
to
the
high
abv
i
feel
that
it
has
to
be
a
little
bit
lower
but
this
beer
is
like
a
meal
unto
itself
a
fine
desert
beer
that
would
probably
good
paired
with
a
rich
chocolate
cake
or
maybe
even
some
vanilla
ice
cream
to
offset
it
amazing
smooth
ale
and
the
last
of
my
stash
since
dfh
stopped
distributing
here
i
guess
ill
have
to
hunt
some
down
on
the
next
road
trip
as
its
definitely
one
i
want
in
my
cellar
o
a
very
interesting
beer
very
complex
and
one
that
merits
discussion
by
beer
lovers
and
advocates
over
its
consumption
a
good
beer
but
certainly
not
one
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
a
really
interesting
beer
definitely
one
of
a
kind
picked
up
a
4
pack
and
will
cellar
the
others
to
see
how
this
develops
overall
i
liked
it
a
lot
complex
and
bold
yet
easy
to
drink
serving
style
ontap
at
dogfish
head
alehouse
fairfax
of
course
at
12
this
is
not
a
session
beer
one
is
good
for
a
sitting
this
beer
is
fantastic
and
definitely
worth
a
slow
sip
to
end
and
evening
o
im
not
exactly
blown
away
by
the
taste
but
everything
works
great
it
gets
better
as
it
goes
along
the
uniqueness
of
the
wood
comes
into
play
over
time
dogfish
head
never
disappoints
theyve
set
the
bar
really
high
with
other
brews
so
its
hard
to
give
this
a
5
or
4
5
overall
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
overall
drinkability
absolutely
delicious
well
balanced
yet
bold
as
hell
o
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
i
would
like
to
try
more
of
it
it
was
one
of
the
most
complex
brown
ales
i
have
experienced
i
would
really
like
to
see
what
age
does
to
this
overall
i
thought
this
was
another
good
take
on
the
american
brown
style
from
dogfish
head
indian
brown
is
a
better
beer
in
my
opinion
but
there
are
not
a
lot
of
12
brown
ales
out
there
its
definitely
a
compliment
that
sam
can
brew
a
big
tasty
beer
in
a
category
that
normally
sees
more
mild
releases
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
to
make
my
first
review
i
debated
going
small
and
doing
a
gateway
beer
for
those
readers
who
havent
had
the
experience
that
i
have
but
then
i
said
screw
it
go
big
or
go
home
this
isnt
a
beer
for
beginners
so
if
you
arent
sure
about
it
then
id
avoid
it
o
this
is
simply
a
drink
that
i
needed
to
be
warned
that
it
should
be
drank
at
completely
room
temperature
i
have
no
problem
enjoying
a
drink
at
room
temperature
but
please
throw
it
on
the
label
after
many
hours
it
finally
became
decent
to
me
different
but
nice
nonetheless
d
good
drinkability
seems
to
me
more
stoutlike
than
brown
ale
definitely
could
not
have
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
good
offering
from
dfh
ill
let
the
other
bottle
age
another
year
or
two
and
see
if
it
mellows
a
bit
this
beer
fresh
would
be
interesting
as
well
m
fairly
still
for
a
beer
thick
viscous
incredible
dense
not
a
beer
for
anything
other
than
savoring
this
is
my
first
sampling
of
dogfish
head
and
i
am
not
at
all
disappointed
worth
the
hype
worth
paying
35
cents
an
ounce
retail
o
honestly
ive
never
really
understood
the
obsession
with
dogfish
head
most
of
their
beers
are
mediocre
at
best
but
this
is
the
one
beer
of
theirs
that
i
get
excited
about
its
very
unique
bringing
qualities
of
a
sweeter
imperial
stout
and
stuffing
them
into
a
brown
ales
body
and
then
aging
it
on
a
unique
wood
that
gives
it
a
great
flavor
dogfish
head
ill
never
be
a
devotee
but
i
sure
will
keep
buying
this
beer
o
a
wonderful
beer
probably
wont
buy
this
as
a
four
pack
again
though
one
goes
a
long
long
way
o
a
pretty
fantastic
brew
definitely
not
drinking
more
than
one
bottle
a
night
at
12
though
seems
a
bit
hot
when
its
fresh
but
at
about
a
year
and
a
half
old
it
has
mellowed
out
just
fine
more
beer
should
be
aged
on
palo
santo
wood
highly
recommended
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
which
goes
through
a
multitude
of
flavors
while
not
failing
on
any
of
them
lightening
on
the
sweetness
would
improve
this
but
not
much
another
great
dfh
to
add
to
the
list
a
20
12oz
bottle
from
2008
poured
into
a
huge
snifter
almost
no
head
on
a
melted
chocolate
velvety
sludgy
soil
colored
liquid
from
the
heavens
smells
of
booze
right
away
vanilla
and
some
kind
of
sappy
wood
one
of
the
most
alluring
aromatic
impressions
ive
ever
come
across
in
any
beer
taste
is
magnificent
strong
definitely
wood
aged
not
sweet
as
i
thought
it
might
be
earthy
possibly
raisins
or
even
dried
black
currants
in
a
nonfruity
way
so
many
subtleties
here
need
more
of
these
to
disect
it
better
wow
awesome
mouthfeel
perfect
after
a
big
meal
as
a
slow
sipper
warming
up
to
room
temperature
is
a
must
for
this
baby
i
wonder
if
the
vintage
makes
much
difference
here
only
one
ive
ever
had
but
wow
is
this
good
big
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
and
almost
caustic
if
held
in
the
mouth
for
awhile
12
all
the
way
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
this
one
overall
i
truly
love
this
beer
but
drinking
too
many
in
a
row
will
definitely
cloud
your
judgement
dfh
has
done
a
incredible
job
with
this
beer
maybe
its
lust
or
love
doesnt
matter
you
will
find
a
winner
with
palo
santo
marron
cheers
o
i
think
i
need
to
age
a
case
and
it
might
become
an
amazing
beer
o
this
is
truly
a
treat
for
a
beer
i
tried
my
hardest
to
take
tiny
sips
while
reviewing
so
i
didnt
drink
it
all
right
away
only
half
remains
though
and
im
feeling
the
kick
that
this
beer
delivers
already
if
you
are
up
for
a
12oz
glass
of
wine
in
terms
of
abv
disguised
as
a
beer
look
no
further
i
like
all
the
flavors
of
this
beer
individually
but
as
a
whole
i
dont
think
they
really
meld
together
the
wood
aging
is
also
way
too
strong
im
not
a
fan
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dogfish
head
beers
not
only
is
it
pretty
widely
available
but
it
is
one
of
the
best
they
brew
this
is
the
kind
of
innovation
you
would
expect
from
them
but
nothing
over
the
top
like
other
things
they
have
done
that
being
said
i
had
no
idea
how
to
review
this
one
it
deserves
a
category
all
of
its
own
definitely
not
a
brown
ale
great
brew
o
exceedingly
rich
and
delicious
absolutely
a
sipper
its
bold
and
beautiful
one
of
dfhs
brews
that
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
for
me
o
very
pleasant
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
dragons
milk
from
new
holland
definitely
the
most
unique
brown
ale
ive
had
to
date
96
o
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
think
it
was
worth
the
price
i
paid
for
if
im
just
enjoying
the
flavor
in
terms
of
abv
its
not
a
bad
deal
though
overall
very
complex
its
wine
nose
is
followed
by
a
very
sharp
biting
first
sip
that
manages
to
evolve
to
creamy
when
held
on
the
palate
fairly
well
done
while
it
is
the
most
complex
dogfish
head
beer
ive
tasted
the
balance
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
the
nose
and
taste
are
very
alcoholforward
and
leave
little
room
for
the
bitterness
and
softer
cream
oak
and
smoke
that
should
be
at
the
heart
in
this
beer
o
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
around
in
my
opinion
from
beginning
to
end
i
have
been
impressed
by
this
one
this
is
very
enjoyable
overall
would
i
buy
this
again
absolutely
im
gonna
have
to
buy
a
few
four
packs
and
age
them
im
sure
this
beer
develops
beautifully
over
the
years
overall
this
is
the
greatest
brown
ale
that
i
have
ever
tasted
period
i
think
that
it
is
extremely
well
put
together
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
gd
expensive
but
definitely
money
well
spent
cant
wait
to
age
the
rest
of
my
four
pack
and
see
how
it
matures
well
done
dogfish
head
well
done
starts
slow
clap
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
price
though
o
this
beer
is
just
amazing
it
is
really
expensive
but
well
worth
the
money
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
o
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
dfh
brews
amazingly
unique
and
really
really
enjoyable
ive
been
a
fan
of
palo
santo
marron
ever
since
i
had
it
on
tap
in
portland
in
2008
its
easily
my
favorite
dfh
beer
i
reviewed
a
bottle
in
2009
but
at
the
time
i
didnt
feel
i
did
it
justice
so
i
scrapped
it
when
i
came
across
a
growler
i
figured
i
might
as
well
get
in
a
proper
tick
o
glad
i
tried
this
nice
stuff
thats
got
some
nice
complex
flavors
id
like
to
cellar
a
few
and
see
hoe
the
age
real
nice
o
overall
a
good
beer
but
very
strong
lots
of
alcohol
especially
in
the
taste
not
my
favorite
dfh
heer
but
not
bad
at
all
and
id
be
interested
to
see
how
this
one
ages
over
time
would
give
it
another
shot
do
drinkability
is
high
i
think
this
has
held
up
pretty
well
both
in
the
way
it
developed
in
the
bottle
and
my
expectations
and
memory
of
it
its
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
remember
im
not
sure
if
it
was
like
that
the
first
time
i
had
it
or
if
the
two
years
of
age
brought
it
out
a
bit
still
insanely
drinkable
for
12
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
but
if
anything
its
the
sweetness
that
would
be
the
limiting
factor
for
this
beer
d
drinkability
sippability
would
be
a
better
way
to
rate
this
it
has
so
much
going
on
but
its
all
incredibly
tasty
a
truly
worldclass
beer
even
more
so
when
on
tap
holy
lord
this
is
one
complex
beer
everything
is
kind
of
mingling
around
and
its
kind
of
like
a
ground
war
sip
this
thing
and
enjoy
each
flavor
but
dont
let
it
get
too
warm
the
solvent
alcohol
flavor
will
start
to
dominate
o
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
it
really
is
i
wasnt
quite
expecting
it
but
the
wood
aging
makes
a
huge
difference
its
right
up
there
with
world
wide
stout
and
raison
dextra
as
my
favorite
dfh
beers
plus
for
some
reason
this
has
given
me
more
motivation
to
homebrew
than
ive
ever
had
i
guess
its
just
because
ive
seen
the
brewing
process
for
this
beer
and
tasted
how
awesome
the
result
was
great
beer
great
backstage
videos
and
now
great
inspirationdogfish
head
you
rock
o
other
than
the
rather
harsh
finish
this
is
a
good
beer
although
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
brown
ale
i
enjoyed
it
fairly
well
but
dont
think
it
was
worth
what
i
payed
for
it
o
one
of
my
favorites
its
so
great
and
so
strong
for
a
brown
ale
stick
a
very
thick
chewy
beer
its
a
bit
too
sweet
and
malty
for
me
but
its
an
interesting
brew
definitely
couldnt
have
more
than
1
not
bad
though
o
a
very
enjoyable
dark
heavy
angry
brew
great
complexity
taste
and
smell
are
really
nice
overall
a
great
one
from
dfh
and
i
can
see
why
it
is
ranked
so
highly
overall
a
nice
complex
and
heavy
brown
ale
the
smell
is
very
refreshing
the
taste
is
thick
and
complex
a
great
sipping
brew
cheers
o
this
one
is
a
keeper
a
special
occasion
beer
a
great
cellar
dwellar
had
a
twoyear
old
one
a
few
weeks
ago
that
blew
my
mind
a
great
gift
unique
and
artfully
done
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
a
different
flavor
from
the
palo
santo
wood
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
very
drinkable
for
a
strong
beer
o
i
dont
know
how
this
beer
isnt
considered
a
stout
dogfish
heads
barrel
aged
beers
are
always
winners
this
is
delicious
noticeably
potent
but
well
balanced
and
smooth
this
drinks
more
like
an
imperial
stout
than
an
american
brown
ale
but
that
aside
its
worth
trying
wonderful
beer
a
sipper
and
something
special
you
want
to
linger
and
enjoy
this
i
like
the
fact
that
they
made
this
much
more
accessible
and
put
it
in
a
12
oz
bottle
id
love
to
have
this
again
and
it
was
only
about
6
worth
every
penny
o
overall
a
very
tasty
brown
ale
a
bit
pricey
but
enjoyable
nontheless
will
have
this
again
this
is
a
real
categorybuster
i
found
this
differentiated
from
other
brown
ales
and
superior
to
most
of
them
at
the
price
it
will
be
a
while
before
i
try
it
again
but
really
its
worth
it
silly
me
why
do
i
care
about
to
style
o
would
of
sworn
this
was
a
stout
until
i
read
the
side
of
the
bottle
and
was
educated
very
smooth
for
12
reallly
wish
dfh
was
readily
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
everything
about
it
is
near
flawless
the
only
issue
i
have
with
it
is
being
labeled
a
brown
ale
i
dont
think
it
follows
the
style
it
is
more
similar
to
a
full
bodied
barrel
aged
imperial
stout
o
very
good
but
for
the
price
and
high
abv
probably
wont
buy
it
again
but
damn
packing
a
buzz
this
is
obviously
not
a
traditional
brown
ale
along
the
lines
of
samuel
smith
but
it
is
very
unique
flavorful
and
worth
the
high
price
once
in
a
while
i
see
myself
picking
it
up
once
a
year
overall
the
fact
that
this
isnt
overly
sweet
really
surprised
me
i
thought
it
was
complex
and
very
interesting
the
year
of
aging
was
good
for
this
beer
but
it
is
still
a
bit
hot
bottled
on
date
041911
odi
have
been
putting
this
off
due
to
the
fact
that
i
a
do
not
like
much
from
dogfish
head
besides
60
minute
ipa
and
b
its
about
16
dollars
for
a
fourpack
of
this
when
i
saw
it
on
tap
i
knew
i
needed
to
try
it
out
cool
beer
not
the
right
time
of
year
and
a
bit
too
alcohol
ridden
for
my
taste
most
dogfish
brews
leave
me
tongue
awkwardly
too
dried
up
from
the
booze
this
one
is
no
different
good
but
not
exceptional
in
my
worthless
opinion
cheers
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
coffee
color
head
smells
of
olives
espresso
wood
and
alcohol
tastes
of
chocolate
coffee
alcohol
dates
soy
sauce
molasses
tobacco
light
carbonation
on
this
and
a
very
thick
mouth
feel
from
the
high
abv
if
there
was
like
a
9
abv
style
of
this
i
think
you
would
be
able
to
taste
more
of
the
flavors
this
stuff
is
strong
out
of
the
bottle
comes
a
very
dark
murky
brown
that
once
in
the
glass
looks
more
like
an
opaque
black
very
little
tanbrown
head
developed
and
what
did
appear
dissipated
back
to
a
ring
of
bubbles
very
quickly
smells
of
light
woods
cedar
pine
alcohol
dark
fruits
cane
sugar
caramel
and
faint
vanilla
tastes
of
the
aforementioned
woods
caramel
vanilla
sugar
date
plum
and
a
touch
of
grape
not
any
kind
of
sour
grape
just
a
faint
red
grape
flavor
its
balanced
quite
well
with
only
a
subtle
alcohol
presence
in
the
very
end
mouthfeel
is
great
with
the
carbonation
cutting
through
the
otherwise
viscous
fluid
i
was
surprised
to
notice
the
carbonation
after
watching
such
little
head
development
in
the
beginning
overall
a
delicious
brew
that
i
regret
not
having
more
regular
access
to
o
excellent
sipper
but
never
gets
bogged
down
drinkability
is
good
always
a
treat
easy
to
forget
that
its
12
o
as
a
special
occasion
beer
there
are
few
of
its
equal
drinking
palo
santo
marron
is
like
tasting
the
air
after
waking
up
in
a
mossy
glade
with
the
thinning
fog
revealing
the
rainstained
trunks
of
oak
trees
d
this
one
is
a
whopper
it
is
so
strong
i
would
not
have
another
for
a
while
if
ever
a
fun
experience
but
not
the
greatest
and
certainly
not
for
most
overall
this
beer
is
nothing
about
this
beer
is
ordinary
i
picked
this
beer
up
in
a
mix
your
own
six
pack
i
did
not
look
much
at
the
label
i
didnt
know
until
after
drinking
that
it
was
a
brown
ale
and
12
abv
you
would
never
know
that
it
is
12
it
is
hidden
real
well
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
ever
tried
and
without
knowing
overall
this
is
not
your
average
brown
ale
like
most
dfh
beers
it
is
in
its
own
category
but
very
good
i
would
buy
this
again
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
stark
woodiness
not
only
did
the
nose
explode
with
notes
of
a
unique
woody
character
but
the
taste
correspondingly
lived
up
to
the
noses
name
what
we
were
presented
with
was
an
epic
brown
ale
which
looked
smelled
and
tasted
more
the
part
of
a
fatty
stout
this
being
said
this
was
a
great
beer
but
it
seemed
a
little
out
of
proportion
for
the
style
again
this
doesnt
really
matter
except
for
classifications
sake
but
this
was
quite
a
surprising
beer
and
a
robust
one
at
that
m
bold
and
dark
the
brown
ale
is
easily
one
of
the
most
complex
woodaged
beers
ive
had
glad
it
was
on
tap
when
we
arrived
i
gave
it
a
pour
comes
out
as
a
really
thick
dark
brown
color
with
a
thinner
light
brown
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
full
of
wood
that
this
beer
is
aged
on
the
aroma
is
also
kind
of
sweet
smelling
and
rich
with
brown
sugar
i
think
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
big
its
got
some
of
the
biggest
flavors
ive
ever
had
from
a
brown
ale
there
is
the
wood
flavors
some
dark
fruits
and
a
touch
of
coffee
in
there
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
decent
carbonation
and
oily
overall
this
beer
is
really
nice
if
you
like
strong
ales
this
one
is
impressive
d
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
brown
ale
or
even
a
strong
brown
more
of
an
american
strong
or
something
else
entirely
once
i
get
past
this
the
fact
that
this
is
a
nonstyled
brew
its
delicious
sipper
great
dessert
beer
with
great
complexity
o
a
very
good
beer
with
great
wood
flavor
from
a
wood
not
often
used
in
the
brewing
world
the
flavors
work
nicely
and
makes
for
a
nice
sipper
o
this
is
probably
around
the
15th
bottle
i
have
had
but
i
decided
to
review
it
tonight
palo
santo
is
a
great
beer
much
more
complex
and
stronger
than
anything
in
the
traditional
brown
ale
category
it
almost
deserves
a
category
of
its
own
must
try
if
you
find
it
o
goes
down
easily
very
tasty
not
overly
filling
ridiculously
well
hidden
kick
crazy
representation
of
style
yea
big
big
big
fan
of
this
beer
the
oak
and
wood
notes
are
solid
and
just
are
amazing
in
my
opinion
the
12
is
so
ridiculously
well
hidden
yea
wow
if
you
dont
love
this
oaky
goodness
you
need
to
check
yourself
full
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
this
beer
coats
your
mouth
well
but
is
a
little
sticky
the
carbonation
is
not
extremely
noticeable
but
is
just
enough
to
help
make
this
beer
drinkable
for
a
brown
ale
this
beer
is
thick
but
for
a
dark
beer
it
is
smooth
o
i
was
expecting
a
brown
ale
with
unique
character
when
i
took
my
first
taste
i
had
to
double
check
the
abv
i
didnt
realize
originally
that
it
was
12
i
would
say
this
is
too
strong
to
be
classified
as
a
brown
ale
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
sipping
it
not
bad
booze
takes
the
cake
on
this
one
for
me
a
definite
sipper
other
than
that
it
was
very
unique
with
its
wodd
flavors
would
try
again
im
quite
astounded
by
this
beer
both
for
its
audacity
and
craftsmanship
as
well
as
the
melange
of
flavors
that
is
at
once
beer
and
cognac
and
always
complex
and
imaginative
some
may
find
this
brew
overly
sweet
or
sugary
but
to
say
so
takes
away
from
the
many
layers
of
sugars
in
itself
quite
amazing
as
well
as
the
coffees
and
grapefruit
bitters
that
lie
just
underneath
five
stars
the
tangy
wood
flavor
is
well
developed
curiously
also
some
iron
and
spice
as
well
textured
held
up
well
with
age
while
it
did
improve
its
still
not
outstanding
also
american
brown
ale
really
maybe
american
strong
ale
is
a
better
fit
for
this
brew
virtually
no
head
to
speak
of
resulted
in
a
thin
circle
of
head
in
center
of
glass
dark
brown
opaque
body
no
visible
carbonation
the
wood
aroma
is
somewhat
balanced
by
caramel
malts
with
little
hop
odors
and
a
overpowering
booziness
taste
is
overwhelming
boozy
not
any
balance
at
all
pretty
full
mouthfeel
with
little
effervescence
significant
alcohol
heat
i
didnt
like
this
at
all
and
wont
have
any
in
the
future
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
ive
had
the
entire
year
perhaps
the
issue
is
the
imperial
brown
category
not
a
big
fan
of
this
lacking
in
balance
and
nuance
evidently
im
not
an
off
center
person
avoid
this
was
good
but
as
i
remember
from
before
i
started
formally
writing
up
reviews
on
ba
this
woodaging
doesnt
impart
the
flavors
ive
been
typically
enjoying
id
like
a
little
less
of
a
burnt
boozy
taste
and
thats
what
is
memorable
concerning
this
beer
o
every
once
in
awhile
its
nice
to
splurge
on
a
nice
4pack
of
palo
plus
it
ages
amazingly
a
must
try
if
youve
never
very
unique
nice
work
dfh
overall
really
tasty
beer
i
paired
this
with
some
barbecued
st
louis
ribs
and
it
was
great
the
alcohol
was
nowhere
near
as
pronounced
a
id
thought
it
would
be
that
proved
to
be
a
little
dangerous
and
after
one
glass
that
was
enough
for
me
o
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
night
cap
so
much
going
on
i
do
not
see
myself
getting
tired
of
opening
one
of
these
you
can
taste
the
higher
abv
slightly
during
consumption
but
it
definitely
can
sneak
up
on
you
afterwards
2
of
these
and
time
to
go
to
bed
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
hue
with
very
average
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
quarter
finger
head
and
no
lacingthe
smell
is
oakbrown
sugarmaple
syrup
and
boiled
candythe
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
creamy
and
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
with
hints
of
brown
sugarmaple
syrupjarrah
honeya
tinge
of
wood
and
is
finished
sweet
with
a
sticky
date
pudding
finish
and
overall
even
though
the
high
12
abv
is
very
well
hidden
this
brew
is
way
to
sweet
for
the
anyday
brew
and
is
definately
more
of
a
nightcap
brew
suited
to
sticky
sweet
deserts
cheers
o
fantastically
balanced
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
couple
more
to
cellar
for
a
few
years
ill
buy
another
one
for
sure
o
this
is
my
favorite
dogfish
head
brew
on
the
pricey
side
but
definitely
one
i
pick
from
time
to
time
this
is
a
tremendous
ale
and
it
is
a
privilege
to
drink
it
was
an
expensive
case
at
85
but
considering
what
you
get
it
is
actually
a
bargain
ales
of
this
power
and
complexity
are
rare
even
in
this
golden
age
of
the
craft
brewer
this
cannot
be
considered
a
session
ale
but
that
being
said
i
find
it
quite
easy
to
drink
three
of
these
over
the
course
of
1
to
2
hours
overall
probably
one
of
the
top
3
beers
ive
ever
had
has
the
initial
appearance
of
imperial
stout
the
aroma
is
fantastic
with
the
aged
wood
really
standing
out
along
with
hints
of
vanilla
the
taste
picks
up
right
where
the
aroma
leaves
off
with
the
warm
malty
flavor
with
a
high
alcohol
kick
at
12
youve
gotta
be
careful
with
this
one
as
it
can
be
very
easy
to
have
one
too
many
by
far
the
best
beer
in
the
dogfish
portfolio
what
a
surprising
beer
this
was
i
bought
this
on
the
dfh
name
alone
as
im
a
big
fan
but
hadnt
previous
tried
this
its
a
dark
beer
given
the
time
of
year
but
i
had
to
give
it
a
whirl
i
freely
admit
this
will
be
infinitely
more
enjoyable
when
the
weather
cools
down
it
wasnt
until
i
drank
my
first
two
that
i
realized
this
was
a
12
beer
while
it
has
a
nice
strong
profile
to
it
the
alcohol
content
is
marginally
noticeable
be
careful
with
these
lol
wonderful
woodyvanillabourbon
profile
interested
in
aging
some
of
this
o
great
beer
even
better
with
a
couple
years
on
it
oanother
great
beer
from
dogfish
head
can
wait
to
have
again
o
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
complex
and
has
a
lot
of
character
easy
to
have
one
too
many
i
would
buy
this
again
but
in
small
quantities
for
the
record
i
would
consider
this
an
imperial
brown
ale
if
anything
when
i
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
black
body
with
a
1
tan
head
which
lays
down
slowly
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
woody
and
roasted
malts
comes
through
when
i
tasted
the
beer
my
first
taste
was
smokey
roasted
malts
then
some
sweetness
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
beer
has
a
thick
mouth
feel
to
me
overall
this
beer
is
not
for
me
a
little
thick
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
o
good
beer
will
probably
improve
with
age
o
this
is
a
very
good
widely
available
brew
and
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
dfh
of
course
its
got
high
abv
but
they
masked
it
well
the
berry
and
wood
flavor
blend
so
well
in
this
i
highly
recommend
this
and
would
certainly
have
again
o
i
didnt
expect
such
a
widely
available
beer
that
only
gets
peripheral
attention
to
have
so
much
unique
character
and
be
so
bold
i
really
liked
this
and
have
3
more
from
my
four
pack
laid
down
and
aging
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
aging
will
do
to
this
and
cant
wait
to
revisit
it
absolutely
worth
picking
up
as
im
sure
its
somewhere
around
you
few
so
widely
available
beers
near
as
good
as
this
o
this
beer
needs
more
time
but
man
its
not
drinking
so
bad
right
now
i
remember
trying
this
quite
fresh
before
and
it
was
a
hot
mess
this
is
much
better
and
progressing
at
an
impressive
rate
right
now
its
hard
for
me
to
assess
what
the
potential
cap
of
this
beer
could
be
and
at
12
abv
it
could
be
quite
a
while
the
complexity
of
the
palo
wood
is
going
to
take
this
to
new
and
exciting
places
i
anticipate
that
mellowing
the
alcohol
with
the
wood
will
take
this
to
incredible
heights
this
is
certainly
a
beer
to
revisit
every
6
months
or
so
what
a
joy
it
is
to
be
able
to
get
this
in
4
packs
id
give
each
bottle
6
months
more
than
the
last
overall
a
very
good
sipping
beer
seriously
its
12
but
not
your
stock
session
brown
ale
i
am
going
to
age
some
and
see
if
the
heat
mellows
as
well
as
some
of
the
sweetness
o
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
the
year
and
a
half
has
done
this
one
well
i
have
some
fresher
bottles
so
it
will
be
nice
to
see
the
change
an
interesting
beer
with
an
interesting
story
there
are
strong
flavors
in
this
beer
but
i
cant
get
over
the
taste
of
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
warming
as
it
goes
down
im
glad
ive
tried
this
beer
but
will
probably
reach
for
something
else
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
ale
i
would
be
very
interested
in
trying
this
out
of
the
tap
however
o
enjoyed
this
as
it
warned
lots
of
barrel
aged
syout
qualities
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
o
overall
this
beer
has
taken
a
year
of
aging
very
well
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
not
really
your
typical
brown
but
a
true
stand
out
in
the
style
so
worth
the
15
00
for
the
4
pack
if
you
want
something
that
is
hard
to
put
your
finger
on
in
a
good
way
pick
this
up
o
i
am
not
a
fan
of
big
boozy
beers
and
this
beer
was
pretty
boozy
and
left
a
good
amount
of
burn
this
beer
had
some
good
flavor
but
just
a
little
too
boozy
for
me
to
buy
this
one
again
i
think
i
would
have
liked
this
beer
a
lot
more
if
the
booze
was
turned
down
some
i
agree
with
beergut4life
i
bought
it
in
a
store
where
you
can
make
your
own
6
packs
and
on
the
wall
of
bottles
i
saw
this
beer
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
saw
on
the
description
that
it
was
a
brown
ale
but
even
though
ive
had
some
of
the
other
dfh
brews
the
12
abv
made
me
just
grab
1
bottle
i
was
prsently
surprised
that
it
was
syrupy
almost
like
a
porter
sorry
i
bought
just
one
pricey
at
about
13
for
a
4
pack
will
definitely
pick
up
some
more
good
long
finish
the
abv
had
a
delayed
reaction
on
me
not
something
youre
going
to
sit
back
knock
off
afew
while
watching
the
game
not
quite
what
i
expected
for
the
style
but
very
interesting
and
complex
a
nice
compliment
to
grilled
steak
o
definitely
not
what
i
expected
from
a
brown
its
almost
stout
like
in
look
and
flavor
nevertheless
it
is
delicious
and
ill
be
saving
some
to
review
in
a
few
years
smooth
well
balanced
and
brilliantly
complex
a
fantastic
beer
this
is
a
well
crafted
complicated
sipping
beer
that
is
great
with
a
cigar
or
for
a
night
cap
this
pours
a
black
color
i
did
an
aggressive
pour
it
ended
up
with
a
pretty
brown
head
it
leaves
a
nice
lacing
and
thick
legs
the
smell
is
roasted
malts
there
are
some
sweet
scents
vanilla
caramel
a
the
booziness
is
present
also
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
and
creamy
its
wonderful
one
of
the
most
smooth
and
creamy
beers
ive
ever
had
the
taste
is
great
also
caramel
and
roasted
malts
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
some
alcohol
burn
on
the
way
down
overall
this
is
one
thick
creamy
tasty
boozy
beer
very
good
stuff
one
of
my
favorites
and
its
beers
like
this
which
cause
me
to
continue
to
search
out
new
brews
drinkability
smooth
but
honestly
if
you
dont
enjoy
a
red
wine
you
may
not
be
so
keen
on
this
brew
at
12
alcohol
more
comparable
to
wine
than
beer
there
is
a
relaxing
buzz
good
for
a
mellow
afternoonevening
o
such
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
beer
its
expensive
but
worth
it
if
you
love
bold
thick
dark
malty
ales
also
its
worth
mentioning
that
i
got
this
from
beersofeurope
co
uk
a
few
weeks
before
dogfish
head
announced
they
would
be
stopping
exports
so
im
quite
lucky
i
have
had
a
chance
at
trying
this
plus
i
have
one
more
left
which
will
be
saved
for
a
cold
winters
evening
dogfish
head
are
truly
a
credit
to
the
us
craft
brewing
industry
this
brew
was
darker
than
i
expected
pouring
from
bottle
to
pint
the
wood
notes
were
strong
but
also
vanilla
notes
stood
out
adding
a
dessertlike
feel
to
the
beer
there
was
a
bit
of
punchy
finish
with
the
higher
abv
but
i
found
the
beer
to
be
refreshing
for
the
summah
times
in
me
although
i
have
a
feeling
i
would
love
one
or
a
few
in
the
snow
i
think
we
need
a
new
category
for
this
beer
how
about
we
call
it
an
imperial
brown
ale
the
flavor
of
this
beer
reminded
me
a
lot
of
bourbon
county
stout
even
with
the
faint
booziness
its
hard
to
believe
this
beer
is
12
alcohol
according
to
the
label
this
beer
should
be
aged
to
allow
the
flavors
to
round
out
a
bit
i
concur
i
think
ill
go
back
to
the
store
tomorrow
and
buy
a
few
more
bottles
so
i
can
age
them
overall
very
well
done
the
unique
character
of
the
wood
enhances
the
basics
in
a
unique
and
complex
way
abv
is
high
and
what
you
would
expect
from
a
barrel
aged
beermalt
beverage
heavy
bodied
and
wholesome
very
pleasant
to
drink
only
reservation
would
be
a
bit
more
carbonation
could
be
desired
just
to
enhance
the
mouthfeel
and
liven
up
the
appearance
o
its
a
big
beer
complex
as
it
warms
up
the
beer
definitely
begins
to
taste
better
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
but
its
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
i
am
really
pleased
with
this
brew
wood
taste
is
surprising
but
in
a
great
way
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
four
of
these
to
put
a
little
age
on
them
and
see
what
happens
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
theres
some
heat
on
the
tongue
but
its
fairly
far
from
the
taste
buds
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
nearly
no
light
getting
through
the
head
is
dark
tan
to
light
brown
in
color
and
it
recedes
fairly
quickly
the
smell
is
slightly
roasty
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
an
interesting
woody
aroma
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
smell
the
different
woody
aroma
is
p
front
in
the
flavor
with
the
finish
being
slightly
burnt
and
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lower
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
not
ad
but
would
not
buy
it
often
o
easily
one
of
the
best
year
round
dogfish
head
brews
this
brewery
never
seizes
to
amaze
me
what
an
exquisite
beer
overall
i
love
this
beer
its
a
complex
sipper
that
always
wakes
up
my
palate
brown
ale
is
deceiving
but
you
have
to
call
it
something
this
would
be
in
my
top
five
desert
island
beers
i
never
get
tired
of
it
i
do
suggest
seeking
it
out
if
the
flavors
described
are
your
thing
however
this
beer
is
worthless
greeen
aged
two
years
it
should
be
impeccable
o
very
complex
and
interesting
beer
overall
definitely
one
to
sit
and
enjoy
particularly
since
the
12
abv
wouldnt
really
work
as
a
session
smoothvelvety
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
more
similar
to
a
porter
in
body
than
a
brown
ale
serving
type
bottle
a
creamy
flavor
but
a
but
on
the
bitter
side
and
a
bit
hard
to
swallow
down
due
to
the
alcohol
content
and
its
carry
through

the
flavor

thin
ring
of
light
brown
head
aroma
is
boozey
raisins
dark
fruits
and
earth
notes
hints
of
chocolate
and
burnt
coffee
flavor
is
a
boozey
mix
of
some
coffee
raisins
and
earthiness
vanilla
as
well
the
finish
is
a
mix
of
alcohol
along
with
the
vanilla
and
caramel
flavors
that
come
from
the
wood
barrels
the
high
abv
and
the
overall
boozey
flavor
to
this
one
hurt
its
drinkability
but
all
things
considered
you
can
still
drink
it
at
a
decent
pace
this
beer
has
similar
flavors
and
qualities
to
it
that
some
of
the
other
high
octane
dfh
beers
have
like
wws
olde
school
etc
overall
its
a
solid
beer
and
a
nice
twist
on
the
style
worth
buying
overall
very
tasty
and
interesting
brew
another
good
one
from
these
guys
an
aggressive
pour
yields
only
a
halffinger
creamy
mocha
head
the
beer
is
a
dark
opaque
chestnut
brown
wonderful
aroma
full
of
vanilla
hints
of
warming
alcohol
sweet
toffee
and
dark
fruitsmuch
like
a
stout
but
heavier
on
the
dark
fruit
and
a
lighter
roasted
character
this
sure
comes
as
a
shock
to
my
ipaladen
palatelayers
upon
layers
of
malty
goodness
roastednutty
malt
is
much
more
apparent
in
the
taste
with
some
chocolate

well
lots

sweetness
the
wood
aging
seems
to
be
doing
great
things
warm
finish
with
the
alcohol
helping
to
dry
it
out
aftertaste
is
highly
reminiscent
of
a
nice
rum
fullbodied
low
carbonation
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
deserves
to
be
slowly
sipped
and
treated
with
respect
i
just
tried
this
for
the
first
time
at
new
local
hot
spot

at

on

beakeresque
wine
glass
this
yields
the
darkest
brown
color
crosses
into
black
and
sits
under
a
light
cap
of
tan
foam
the
nose
carries
a
solid
aroma
of
deep
dark
roasted
sweet
caramel
malt
fresh
brewed
espresso
vanilla
cream
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
from
start
to
finish
is
a
crisp
and
complex
malty
one
with
well
pronounced
and
pleasant
notes
of
dark
roasted
cocoa
caramel
and
what
i
suspect
to
be
the
holy
tree
wood
accent
of
the
palo
santo
this
has
dogfish
head
written
all
over
it
with
its
deceivingly
hidden
abv
and
friendly
finish
id
love
to
pick
up
a
four
pack
or
two
and
immediately
start
aging
these
guys
rum
hits
the
mouth
followed
by
plumb
and
raisin
and
then
a
chocolate
coating
finishes
dry
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
weird
but
delightful
it
has
an
overall
earthy
character
that
ties
it
together
an
excellent
brown
ale
royal
and
over
the
top
but
damn
good
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
this
beer
and
it
far
exceeded
my
memory
and
expectations
get
this
beer
if
you
have
the
opportunity
0
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
beer
the
flavors
taste
great
the
vanilla
and
molasses
are
nicely
complemented
by
the
smoke
oak
and
alcohol
the
oak
and
alchol
flavors
become
more
intense
as
the
beer
sits
so
if
thats
what
you
are
into
id
recommend
that
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
certainly
be
having
a
few
more
in
the
near
future
o
wow
dogfish
head
is
my
favorite
brewery
but
as
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
their
psm
i
am
surprised
and
impressed
the
flavor
gets
better
as
i
drink
it
it
smells
great
this
beer
is
just
awesome
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
but
i
most
likely
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
per
evening
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thinner
side
of
fullbodied
and
has
the
right
level
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
for
such
a
huge
beer
this
is
a
sipper
that
reveals
complexities
as
it
warms
but
surely
isnt
hard
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
i
know
dogfish
calls
this
a
brown
ale
but
id
easily
call
this
an
imperial
stout
it
looks
like
a
stout
smells
like
a
stout
and
tastes
like
a
stout
this
beer
keeps
getting
better
this
review
is
of
a
bottle
ive
had
since
march
2009
if
only
the
smell
were
a
little
more
interesting
and
it
were
slightly
less
sweet
the
sweetness
comment
applies
to
pretty
much
every
dogfish
head
beer
though
i
think
i
will
have
my
ladt
two
bottles
each
year
for
the
next
two
years
and
then
buy
four
more
o
i
think
you
have
to
be
careful
drinking
this
because
it
is
12
abv
but
you
dont
taste
the
alcohol
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
i
found
it
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
complex
taste
with
so
many
flavors
that
come
out
while
drinking
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
i
dont
know
how
often
i
would
drink
it
probably
more
in
the
winter
time
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
an
imperial
stout
overall
a
suprisingly
easy
drinking
brew
good
interestin
flavors
nearing
a
an
aged
rum
with
caramelvanillaester
notes
a
little
knock
on
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
as
this
is
a
touch
cloying
on
the
finish
and
very
dark
for
a
brown
bottle
dated
10
13
10a
overall
this
is
not
a
horrible
beer
but
definitely
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
the
bite
may
be
too
much
for
me
amazing
and
well
worth
tasting
if
you
want
to
try
a
new
kind
of
wood
flavor
which
is
rareunusual
overall
a
very
good
brew
above
average
for
the
style
and
impressive
taste
considering
the
high
volume
of
alcohol
i
could
easily
make
this
a
weekend
sipper
one
or
two
bottles
ought
to
do
the
trick
three
if
i
didnt
have
to
get
up
in
the
morning
full
bodied
and
thick
one
beer
is
plenty
with
this
one
o
tasty
beer
the
wood
helps
make
the
beer
poured
into
a
dfh
signature
glass
this
brew
pours
a
near
black
and
produces
only
a
slight
tan
head
it
is
a
big
and
bold
imperial
brown
ale
that
can
hang
with
some
imperial
stouts
wonderful
aromas
of
plums
and
raisins
and
black
cherries
the
sweet
fruits
smell
delicious
the
carbonation
is
low
and
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
thick
flavors
of
blackberry
and
burnt
cherry
are
immediate
along
with
dark
fruits
and
chocolate
and
hints
of
expresso
and
malt
dark
and
sweet
fruits
go
back
and
forth
and
lay
down
the
flavor
profile
this
brew
is
amazingly
complex
with
a
slight
licorice
and
bitter
black
coffee
finish
the
alcohol
presence
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
this
brew
is
deliciousof
my
absolute
favorites
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
puts
a
very
dry
feeling
onto
the
palate
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
smoke
stick
to
the
palate
overall
what
a
fantastic
slow
sipper
this
will
age
so
well
im
a
little
weary
of
dogfish
head
in
that
i
would
like
to
enjoy
everything
they
make
but
some
of
their
brews
just
dont
impress
me
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
their
beers
that
ive
had
so
far
o
glad
to
have
finally
tasted
this
one
have
passed
it
over
for
far
too
long
if
i
had
two
sheesh
sneaky
potent
stuff
will
have
again
yummy
overall
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
too
often
but
its
a
nice
one
to
have
around
quite
drinkable
yet
complex
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
on
bottom
of
the
bottle
is
3110
b2
1750
im
assuming
that
this
was
bottled
3110
and
batchbarrel
2
consumed
the
bottle
on
51911
anyways
it
was
excellent
and
i
highly
recommend
it
o
this
beer
an
intrigues
me
like
a
lays
potato
chip
i
cant
have
just
1
it
says
12
but
tastes
more
like
67
definitely
a
creeper
other
beers
have
come
and
gone
but
this
beer
has
a
permanent
residence
in
my
fridge
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
you
cannot
sit
down
and
drink
one
its
like
an
entire
night
of
drinking
in
a
bottle
incredibly
interesting
and
wild
an
experience
that
is
worth
having
an
absolute
must
for
anyone
who
enjoys
adventurous
ales
do
yourself
a
favor
and
savor
one
a
good
brew
one
of
the
better
ones
from
dfh
abv
is
pretty
wellhidden
and
i
like
the
uniqueness
of
these
barrels
a
definite
winner
overall
i
had
one
of
these
when
it
was
fresh
and
a
little
bit
of
age
surely
does
this
one
justice
the
alcohol
eased
up
a
bit
and
the
flavors
have
melded
together
very
nicely
a
better
beer
at
6
months
and
a
great
beer
in
general
it
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
gorgeous
light
brown
head
it
smells
rich
of
vanilla
and
something
dark
and
fruity
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lace
and
legs
when
swirled
the
smell
also
greatly
increases
the
taste
is
sweet
and
smooth
with
the
vanilla
chocolate
and
what
tastes
like
liquorice
mix
then
leave
you
with
a
nice
bitter
ending
the
mouthfeel
is
super
smooth
though
somewhat
oily
havent
had
this
one
fresh
but
aged
6
months
is
very
very
good
cheers
o
wonderful
delicious
beer
taking
a
brown
ale
to
this
height
without
falling
apart
or
exhibiting
flaws
is
a
real
accomplishment
well
done
o
i
have
been
enjoying
this
brew
for
a
while
now
and
it
continues
to
grow
on
me
every
time
i
love
it
and
it
has
earned
a
permanent
residence
in
my
beer
fridge
i
do
wish
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
less
but
other
than
that
i
love
lamp
as
it
warms
it
improves
dramatically
drinkability
hard
to
determine
just
did
not
like
this
beer
at
all
poured
a
thick
dark
sludgy
black
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipated
smells
like
wood
and
alcohol
you
cant
really
get
a
sense
of
the
malts
or
hops
in
my
opinion
and
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
beer
especially
for
the
style
tasted
like
i
was
licking
a
piece
of
freshly
cut
wood
not
cool
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
unpleasant
dfh
has
much
much
better
offerings
pours
a
stoutlike
coffee
brown
with
a
thin
cap
of
foam
which
dissipates
pretty
quickly
lacing
is
minimal
nose
is
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
a
strong
candied
banana
and
marshmallow
which
recedes
to
the
secondary
as
it
warms
transitioning
closer
to
the
usual
coffee
chocolate
roasted
malt
plus
some
fruitiness
taste
is
similar
with
now
some
caramel
and
some
astringent
oakey
dryness
other
than
this
the
oak
is
not
at
all
evident
a
nice
mediumfull
body
with
a
fitting
high
carbonation
with
some
but
not
a
ton
of
heat
overall
im
a
little
ambivalent
this
was
interesting
and
unexpected
but
im
not
sure
i
would
reach
for
another
o
brilliant
insert
standing
ovation
this
is
one
of
dfhs
finest
and
being
that
its
a
year
round
brew
i
cant
wait
for
it
to
show
up
on
shelves
near
me
again
soon
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
there
are
certainly
some
very
strong
flavors
that
i
could
imagine
being
perceived
in
many
ways
but
it
worked
for
me
though
did
become
slightly
overwhelming
by
the
end
i
love
all
the
earthy
notes
that
come
from
the
wood
and
for
all
of
the
flavors
it
was
extremely
well
balanced
o
i
have
loved
this
beer
since
it
came
out
and
am
so
glad
that
it
is
in
the
regular
lineup
such
a
great
concept
for
a
beer
and
one
that
actually
comes
all
the
way
out
in
the
beer
itself
overall
just
a
superbly
well
crafted
and
well
balanced
beer
it
falls
into
the
category
of
a
must
try
beer
in
my
opinion
drinkability
great
comfort
beer
nice
warming
feeling
goes
with
this
beer
would
be
great
on
a
cold
night
have
to
get
some
for
the
winter
goes
awesome
with
a
scoop
of
vanilla
bean
ice
cream
theres
something
evil
about
this
beer
in
that
you
dont
know
quite
what
youre
about
to
get
until
you
pour
it
into
your
glass
and
you
see
the
devil
it
was
thick
brownblack
like
10w30
oil
with
a
head
that
once
you
got
it
out
was
a
cap
the
smell
was
powerful
good
something
from
a
wonderful
beer
dream
forget
the
fizzy
lager
smell
you
associate
with
beer
and
take
a
giant
whiff
of
this
potent
mamma
roasted
malt
and
alcohol
were
present
along
with
what
seemed
like
dark
fruits
the
flavor
was
also
roasty
with
a
warming
alcohol
and
finished
with
a
long
lingering
burnt
sugar
very
thick
in
the
mouth
and
down
the
gullet
not
something
youd
want
to
or
be
able
to
have
a
6er
of
anytime
overall
id
say
aside
from
the
thick
feel
this
beer
is
something
to
save
when
you
have
no
heavy
machinery
to
operate
anytime
soon
a
very
good
experience
this
one
is
a
very
thick
and
heavy
with
soft
carbonation
not
bad
here
i
think
there
are
other
browns
i
would
pick
over
it
but
a
unique
beer
worth
trying
poured
a
dark
opaque
brown
with
very
little
head
sweet
malts
in
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
hoppiness
coming
through
more
malts
in
the
taste
with
some
nuttiness
and
caramel
with
a
tinge
of
dark
fruits
evident
in
the
background
medium
mouthfeel
and
fairly
drinkable
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ale
and
this
one
wasnt
too
memorable
o
a
solid
beer
with
a
lot
of
complex
spicy
and
roasty
flavors
aging
it
on
the
wood
gave
it
some
really
nice
characteristics
i
like
what
they
were
trying
to
do
they
just
went
a
bit
overboard
then
again
that
might
be
precisely
what
they
were
trying
to
do
its
a
decent
sipper
anyway
this
was
a
powerful
beer
giving
me
an
instant
headache
from
all
the
smoke
and
spice
but
in
a
good
way
like
some
holiday
porters
do
yknow
it
had
sweetness
to
it
but
also
a
spiced
bitterness
that
worked
to
really
cover
up
the
12
factor
i
really
couldnt
tell
it
was
that
high
of
an
abv
i
had
it
on
tap
a
few
weeks
later
at
howie
sons
and
it
tasted
pretty
much
the
same
as
it
did
in
the
bottle
the
color
is
beautiful
with
little
head
and
it
is
fairly
viscous
but
somehow
that
didnt
bother
me
because
it
had
enough
spice
to
brighten
it
up
this
does
not
taste
like
a
brown
ale
per
se
if
anything
it
should
be
called
a
black
ale
it
pours
thick
and
dark
with
very
little
head
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
it
has
heavy
chocolate
and
fig
overtones
with
a
slight
hop
finish
i
have
never
tasted
anything
like
it
it
is
not
too
sweet
and
not
all
too
dry
there
is
a
strong
alcohol
presence
but
not
in
the
least
bit
over
powering
unlike
the
strong
bastard
american
ales
of
which
i
am
not
a
big
fan
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
it
pours
very
dark
and
thick
into
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
strong
liquorice
and
leaves
a
mocha
foam
that
dissipates
quickly
the
first
taste
has
some
sweetness
and
dark
fruit
but
it
mellows
out
and
finished
slightly
dry
with
a
nice
roastiness
the
alcohol
is
hidden
by
lots
of
flavor
but
this
is
a
big
beer
interesting
and
well
balanced
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
and
unique
brew
really
different
from
your
typical
american
brown
ale
i
never
see
one
this
strong
from
my
experience
it
seems
like
dogfish
head
has
a
thing
for
making
unique
and
extreme
brown
ales
you
usually
dont
see
much
creativity
with
this
style
to
me
it
seems
like
shorts
and
dogfish
head
are
leading
the
way
in
making
unique
browns
i
like
it
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
pretty
good
and
complex
the
palo
santo
wood
imparted
some
nice
flavors
that
i
liked
and
i
thought
they
worked
very
well
with
this
beer
for
being
12
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
they
did
a
great
job
at
toning
down
the
booze
and
making
this
seem
much
lighter
then
it
really
is
i
would
buy
a
four
pack
of
this
too
keep
in
the
fridge
if
you
like
browns
but
want
something
bigger
and
unique
give
this
a
try
you
might
be
surprised
this
was
another
great
beer
from
dogfish
head
you
guys
keep
on
impressing
me
overall
id
say
this
is
my
favorite
beer
out
of
dogfish
head
i
love
their
90
minute
but
this
is
just
so
unique
and
different
this
beer
has
serious
wood
flavor
not
to
mention
a
very
high
alcohol
level
i
am
an
avid
dh
indian
brown
ale
drinker
so
i
had
to
try
this
but
prefer
the
original
would
definetly
order
again
though
since
i
dont
find
often
at
bars
plus
with
twice
the
alcohol
it
could
save
some
cash
overall
this
is
great
one
of
my
favorite
from
dogfish
head
and
a
wonderful
unique
beer
allaround
overall
i
am
impressed
this
is
certainly
another
to
buy
again
i
openly
admit
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
brewery
but
this
one
changes
my
mind
a
little
go
get
it
i
think
baton
burton
is
dogfishs
best
beer
but
this
is
a
very
close
second
these
guys
made
me
a
beer
lover
and
this
is
proof
i
was
right
to
follow
their
ways
o
great
beer
seems
a
bit
more
like
a
porter
or
stout
to
me
but
still
a
great
beer
at
12
though
this
one
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
but
less
bitter
it
has
a
sweetness
i
wouldnt
have
expected
from
how
dark
this
beer
is
it
does
have
a
big
of
an
alcohol
burn
to
it
and
the
high
abv
makes
this
one
a
sipper
but
a
really
nice
beer
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
it
this
is
a
really
really
delicious
beer
rich
dark
malts
wood
a
bit

its

my
glass
is
empty
as
with
some
of
my
other
favorite
brown
ales
and
poured
out
the
last
inch
or
so
of
my
glass

the

side
of

alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
comes
up
a
few
seconds
as
a
warming
sensation
in
the
throat
definately
a
good
brew
that
confused
me
i
was
expecting
a
sweet
brown
with
maybe
some
wood
notes
another
innovative
dogfish
head
brew
that
keep
me
coming
back
overall
this
beer
is
great
tons
of
flavor
this
is
a
new
favorite
of
mine
i
will
definitely
be
getting
more
to
cellar
pretty
drinkable
and
a
fine
taste
to
it
i
highly
recommend
you
really
have
to
like
syrup
and
wood
to
get
into
this
for
me
the
dogfish
indian
brown
ale
is
a
much
better
beer
and
a
better
value
as
well
but
im
a
cheap
prick
so
dont
listen
to
me
find
out
for
yourself
having
been
to
paraguay
a
couple
times
i
just
had
to
seek
this
one
out
poured
out
as
black
as
night
with
a
moderate
head
aroma
was
sweet
like
caramel
taste
was
wonderful
thick
malty
full
bodied
with
moderate
sweetness
the
alcohol
was
fully
integrated
this
beer
can
get
you
into
trouble
really
should
be
sipped
but
goes
down
so
easy
a
wonderful
find
this
is
a
very
nice
brown
ale
was
bottled
in
july
so
had
half
a
year
or
so
to
age
which
is
good
for
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
w
great
head
and
lacing
has
a
woody
scent
due
to
the
barrels
its
aged
in
lots
of
molasses
and
a
touch
of
roasty
expresso
dash
of
chocolate
is
present
it
has
a
nutty
flavor
w
some
vanilla
tones
very
creamy
the
alcohol
is
present
so
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
great
beer
from
dfh
side
notes
its
aged
in
wood
but
i
dont
have
wood
after
drinking
this
its
good
but
not
an
amazing
beer
that
others
make
it
out
to
seem
pours
a
very
dark
opaque
brown
almost
like
a
stout
light
carbonation
and
no
head
though
i
did
start
pouring
on
the
side
one
sniff
and
you
can
tell
that
there
are
some
crazy
notes
added
by
the
palo
santo
i
smell
brown
sugar
maybe
some
gingerbread
caramel
and
also
some
earthy
notes
also
get
a
whiff
of
alcohol
taste
is
very
complex
lots
of
brown
sugarmolasses
with
wonderful
earthy
tones
and
some
toffee
caramel
notes
really
cant
perceive
much
bitterness
you
get
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
as
well
as
a
very
pleasant
slightly
roasty
and
woody
aftertaste
i
would
say
this
beer
is
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
a
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
and
quite
sticky
sweet
finish
definitely
one
to
savor
not
my
usual
cup
of
tea
but
a
well
made
and
intriguing
beer
pretty
drinkable
especially
if
you
consider
the
strength
but
it
is
still
a
big
beer
and
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
one
at
any
given
time
interesting
pretty
good
but
im
not
sure
if
its
worthy
of
the
high
price
however
its
intriguing
enough
that
i
think
it
would
be
great
with
a
number
of
years
on
it
so
ill
probably
pick
some
more
up
to
cellar
d
it
came
in
a
4
pack
and
that
would
take
a
lot
to
handle
man
this
is
only
my
second
beer
from
dogfish
because
they
just
recently
started
distributing
to
sc
and
their
beers
are
mostly
by
the
coast
but
they
did
it
right
again
the
labels
correct
i
now
have
wood
d
still
very
much
a
sipper
worth
the
14
for
a
4
pack
but
not
something
that
i
intend
to
always
have
around
d
one
hell
of
a
brown
ale
flavors
pack
a
punch
especially
as
this
beer
warms
would
be
a

one
to
lay
down

viscous
and
sublime
the
rich
liquid
is
gently
nudged
with
a
rolling
easy
carbonation
that
creates
a

almost
silky
texture
this
beer
is
so
huge
so
packed
with
ingredients
and
flavor
that
it
must
be
respected
and
enjoyed
properly
i
am
basking
in
the
joy
of
each
sip
and
cannot
wait
to
sample
this
again
with
capicola
and
fennel
ahh
the
joys
of
being
a
foodie
and
beer
lover
just
would
like
to
say
that
brown
ales
arent
one
of
my
favorite
types
but
dogfish
nailed
this
one
at
12
alcohol
you
cant
go
wrong
alot
of
flavor
mostly
that
classic
dogfish
malty
bite
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
pretty
common
among
craft
beer
stores
so
buy
one
next
time
your
out
definitely
worth
it

a

earthy
finish
amazingly
smooth
considering
the
abv
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
low
carbonation
considering
how
strong
it
is
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
you
can
barely
taste
any
alcohol
and
that
is
quite
a
feat
for
a
beer
over
12
percent

this
beer
pours
out
a
syrupy
pitch
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
smell
is
of
sweet
plums
raisin
and
some
smokey
alcohol
taste
is
of
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
and
finishes
with
a
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
bitterness
with
some
of
the
smokey
woody
alcohol
to
boot
its
thick
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
slightly
oily
feel
though
this
beer
is
super
strong
and
heavy
its
a
great
sipper
and
worth
a
try
expected
a
lot
from
the
label
and
the
price
and
it
delivered
pours
a
rich
very
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
thin
brownish
whitish

aroma

chocolate

cherry

the
ac
came
in
midway
well
hidden
for
12
in
taste
but
not
the
buzz
overall
another
tasty
treat
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewerys
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
for
the
style
but
still
good
overall
this
is
a
very
hefty
brown
which
makes
it
seem
a
bit
stoutish
its
a
drinkable
beer
but
the
high
abv
slows
things
down
a
bit
d
except
for
the
abv
it
is
extremely
drinkable
a
taste
sensation
for
sure
pours
very
dark
for
even
for
a
brown
ale
almost
completely
black
produces
a
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
smell
is
of
strong
malt
and
sweet
caramel
makes
the
mouth
water
just
a
little
bit
taste
is
smooth
and
somewhat
sweet
with
it
seems
just
a
hint
of
smokiness
mouthfeel
is
easy
and
a
little
bubbly
alcohol
is
not
very
present
in
either
scent
or
taste
which
is
nice
at
12
abv
very
tasty
brew
and
good
for
these
cold
winter
nights
in
sd
drinkability
is
good
as
far
as
taste
but
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
these
all
night
nonetheless
good
for
something
different
definitely
worth
the
money
i
find
myself
on
the
boat
with
the
overall
dogfish
is
a
hit
or
miss
brewery
but
when
they
do
hit
a
home
run
it
is
a
great
one
and
this
is
a
great
brew
d
0
12
abv
is
hidden
exceptionally
well
perhaps
the
best
example
of
hiding
a
high
alcohol
content
that
ive
ever
seen
tasted
a
bigger
and
more
interesting
example
of
a
imo
boring
style
brown
ale
ive
recently
read
a
lot
of
posts
online
about
dogfish
head
being
an
overrated
brewery
i
guess
when
you
make
beer
this
good
its
inevitable
that
youll
be
called
overrated
given
the
high
likelihood
that
youll
be
widely
praised
d
about
average
for
a
12
while
hidden
better
than
many
similar
gravity
beers
the
addition
of
strong
dark
flavors
keeps
this
from
being
remotely
sessionable
cheers
d
the
large
presence
of
alcohol
takes
away
from
this
being
more
drinkable
but
it
is
a
very
nice
sipper
opinion
this
is
an
excellent
and
well
crafted
beer
i
like
the
depth
of
flavor
and
regardless
of
how
he
got
it
sam
has
a
winner
with
this
one
a
wood
aged
american
brown
ale
is
a
good
description
for
this
beer
but
it
has
the
typical
superhoppy
american
character
to
the
side
to
let
the
malt
and
the
wood
accents
shine
through
i
think
that
is
a
good
thing
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
it
is
an
adventure
for
the
palate
any
way
you
look
at
it
shazzam
whoaaaa
nelly
bell
stupendous
beer
not
exactly
a
brown
ale
as
friend
euel
says
its
brown
and
its
an
ale
ok
nuff
said
on
that
but
it
pours
with
a
small
tan
head
and
some
lace
color
is
an
opaque
dark
almost
black
brown
aroma
is
very
rich
and
earthy
fecund
licorice
old
leather
and
bittersweet
flavors
the
same
but
more
full
and
luxurient
kim
jong
il
would
love
this
beer
hail
feerless
leader
body
is
velvety
smooth
and
enticing
almost
too
rich
not
a
session
beer
atlantic
monthly
had
a
great
article
on
brewmaster
d
this
beer
is
definitely
a
slow
sipper
it
would
be
much
more
drinkable
with
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
pours
a
nice
brown
without
much
head
and
some
fizziness
apparent
in
the
body
smell
is
basically
all
booze
and
maybe
a
hint
of
piny
hops
if
anything
taste
is
initially
very
rich
and
roasty
but
the
booze
overwhelms
the
entire
brew
eventually
it
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
with
a
few
shots
of
vodka
mixed
in
its
very
hard
to
drink
this
beer
d
surprisingly
well
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
probably
would
only
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
as
im
sure
the
12
alcohol
would
catch
up
to
you
although
i
didnt
really
notice
it
with
one
bottle
live
oak
market
wow
is
all
i
can
say
about
this
one
have
been
reading
about
it
for
a
few
years
and
wanted
no
needed
to
taste
it
it
was
everything
i
wished
it
could
be
good
abv
good
ibu
taste
was
thick
with
a
bourbon
hint
to
it
the
high
abv
made
for
that
so
very
smooth
and
has
a
few
similarities
to
the
life
and
limb
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
deep
brown
almost
black
in
color
with
a
dark
tan
head
that
disapates
quickly
little
to
no
lacing
but
the
beer
seems
to
cling
to
the
glass
a
great
combination
of
sweet
with
bitter
flavors
were
ever
changing
as
beer
warmed
up
what
a
unique
and
delicious
beer
at
such
a
high
alcohol
level
this
beer
could
be
deadly
if
i
could
afford
to
buy
it
in
bulk
a
sippn
beer
if
ever
there
was
one
d
truly
decadent
beer
makes
for
a
sweet
unique
treat
very
drinkable
for
a
12
abv
brew
alcohol
is
essentially
masked
and
the
interesting
depth
of
flavour
holds
the
attention
of
my
palate
was
glad
to
find
this
one
certainly
recommend
it
and
will
enjoy
drinking
it
again
someday
d
this
beer
is
delicious
but
definitely
a
once
a
night
beer
also
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
other
three
bottles
i
have
from
the
same
batch
i
think
ill
space
them
out
about
34
months
and
see
how
they
age
o
much
better
with
a
little
bit
of
age
on
it
opposed
to
fresh
i
know
my
palate
has
changed
a
lot
since
i
first
had
this
beer
a
year
and
a
half
ago
but
i
remember
it
being
a
bit
rough
not
the
greatest
imperial
brown
out
there
but
i
think
this
will
get
even
better
with
even
more
age
on
it
the
longer
you
can
wait
to
open
this
the
better
scores
adjusted
to
this
review
d
dont
know
how
to
feel
about
this
one
without
a
doubt
its
well
crafted
and
i
can
always
appreciate
coloring
outside
the
lines
the
woody
resinous
spicy
sweetness
gets
to
me
in
a
strange
way
and
im
on
the
fence
that
divides
like
and
dislike
id
turn
down
another
but
im
glad
that
i
tried
one
d
for
me
usually
barrel
aged
beer
i
can
enjoy
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
but
i
think
i
could
drink
this
all
night
a
very
different
but
quality
beer
though
very
sweet
and
a
heavyhitter
as
far
as
abv
is
concerned
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
brew
and
cant
help
wondering
what
sorts
of
roasted
meats
would
pair
best
with
it
overall
impressions
really
a
lot
going
on
here
more
than
i
can
pick
out
it
is
similar
to
other
barrel
aged
beers
but
very
different
as
well
a
very
good
beer
for
sitting
in
front
of
a
fireplace
at
the
end
of
an
evening
or
enjoying
after
dinner
with
a
cigar
would
have
served
it
in
an
oversized
wine
glass
and
likely
will
for
the
next
time
high
alcohol
for
style
4
36
2
if
it
actually
belongs
in
this
style
drinkability
without
a
doubt
the
most
sessionable
beer
i
can
find
above
10
fairly
affordable
too
i
would
probably
have
rated
it
higher
overall
without
the
whole
spit
thing
which
i
must
admit
is
a
huge
turnoff
d
big
burn
of
alcohol
here
its
also
quite
rich
and
hard
to
drink
fast
but
thats
a
good
thing
palo
santo
is
big
and
rich
with
a
burning
finish
this
is
a
very
slow
hour
plus
long
sipper
ill
probably
stash
my
other
bottles
for
5
years
and
see
how
it
does
overall
its
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
creamy
hoppy
and
packs
a
punch
palo
santo
ranks
as
one
of
my
favorite
dogfish
brews
though
i
wouldnt
quaff
it
often
d
very
complex
taste
that
is
perfect
for
a
cold
fall
or
winter
evening
by
the
fire
but
the
alcohol
will
catch
up
to
you
so
be
careful
my
beer
has
been
cold
aged
for
a
year
but
still
tasted
very
smooth
i
would
imagine
that
the
fresh
version
of
this
beer
would
have
more
of
a
bite
to
it
d
two
or
three
of
these
would
make
most
if
not
all
people
call
it
quits
id
venture
to
say
that
after
two
of
these
bad
boys
id
be
good
to
go
a
sipper
that
is
not
meant
to
be
quaffed
quickly
drinkability
perhaps
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
had
and
just
as
great
as
i
would
expect
from
dogfish
head
however
the
12
does
take
effect
fast
and
is
in
the
taste
so
in
terms
of
drinkability
1
in
a
night
and
id
be
done
palo
santo
marron
i
thought
wouldnt
be
too
drinkable
because
of
its
high
abv
but
it
is
the
exact
opposite
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
as
it
warms
and
the
flavors
smooth
out
into
the
alcohol
this
bottle
was
less
than
a
year
old
so
i
fully
intend
to
buy
some
more
of
these
to
set
aside
as
i
can
only
imagine
it
getting
better
with
time
highly
recomended
drinkability
a
sipper
very
nice
and
will
have
again
overall
will
buy
again
i
understand
the
hype
and
the
praise
now
and
damn
is
it
ever
right
on
12
oz
bottle
to
pint
glass
pours
dark
brown
but
by
no
means
opaque
with
a
healthy
tan
head
that
fully
dissipates
over
the
course
of
a
couple
minutes
brown
sugar
raisins
molasses
and
fruity
peppery
alcohol
make
up
the
aroma
flavor
is
burnt
raisins
maple
syrup
sugar
alcohol
dark
fruits
and
some
chocolate
rather
sweet
the
booze
is
obviously
noticeable
but
actually
not
that
distracting
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
thick
drinkability
is
above
average
drinkability
for
the
high
alcohol
i
thought
this
beer
was
easy
to
drink
and
i
enjoyed
the
complexity
of
flavors
and
aroma
i
thought
the
palo
santo
wood
added
a
depth
of
flavor
that
was
very
intriguing
this
was
the
first
extreme
beer
i
ever
really
had
and
coming
back
to
it
over
a
year
later
this
thing
still
blows
me
away
easily
one
of
dfhs
best
brews
ive
ever
had
its
for
sure
on
my
top
10
beers
list
this
is
an
incredibly
dark
beer
essentially
black
the
head
is
deep
tan
the
beer
had
a
rich
complex
and
slightly
woody
aroma
some
prune
raisins
molasses
and
vanilla
are
also
in
there
little
hop
smell
and
a
decent
curtain
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
exceptional
very
intense
and
full
in
flavor
behind
some
alcohol
warmth
theres
a
very
earthy
malt
taste
the
warming
is
intense
although
the
beer
doesnt
really
get
hot
fruits
come
out
more
in
the
flavor
the
beer
has
a
decent
amount
of
residual
sweetness
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
full
in
body
actually
quite
heavy
drinking
this
beer
is
a
very
enjoyable
experience
drinkability
for
high
abv
this
beer
early
on
has
an
almost
unnoticeable
booze
taste
to
it
becoming
very
dangerous
for
someone
such
as
myself
however
as
i
said
earlier
as
it
warms
the
booze
overpowers
the
other
flavors
for
this
reason
its
a
sipper
for
sure
but
almost
a
quick
sipper
so
to
speak
also
a
little
pricey
but
for
dfh
its
worth
it
very
nice
pour
with
a
super
complex
nose
figs
vanilla
ripe
raisins
heavy
molasses
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
complex
to
say
the
least
with
dark
jammy
fruits
vanilla
bean
chocolate
smothered
raspberries
blackstrap
molasses
and
caramelized
brown
sugar
you
can
pull
different
flavors
every
time
you
take
a
sip
the
finest
imperial
brown
ive
tasted
a
sipper
with
incredible
mouthfeel
heavy
yet
still
bubblythe
finish
is
like
the
energizer
bunny
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
perfect
for
an
evening
drink
this
one
should
definitely
be
sought
out
if
you
like
brown
ales
with
some
punch
you
will
like
this
o
try
it
very
interesting
and
unique
will
definitely
purchase
again
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
brown
head
sweet
aroma
with
roasted
malty
smell
definitely
a
boozy
sweet
alcohol
aroma
that
carries
over
slightly
to
the
taste
also
a
lot
of
sweet
dark
fruits
and
chocolatey
bitterness
this
is
kind
of
a
big
beer
but
pretty
drinkable
i
thought
d
this
is
a
big
beer
and
it
is
tasty
but
it
does
fill
you
up
pretty
quick
and
packs
a
punch
dark
dark
dark
beer
decent
head
for
such
high
alcohol
the
carbonation
is
minimal
in
the
taste
though
smell
is
caramelesque
deep
thick
flavor
almost
stoutlike
but
a
lot
sweeter
not
sure
if
i
can
taste
the
palo
santo
but
i
do
sense
some
oak
like
flavor
reminescent
of
a
bourbon
barrel
or
the
like
the
after
taste
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
leaves
a
nice
rich
slightly
woodysmokey
flavor
that
lingers
nicely
the
alcohol
does
come
through
a
bit
but
its
not
overwhelming
smell
is
strong
with
alcohol
and
roasted
malts
didnt
taste
as
boozy
as
it
smelled
very
complex
taste
i
enjoyed
the
one
glass
of
this
beer
i
had
the
wood
added
some
very
interesting
flavors
to
this
dark
brown
oily
almost
black
with
good
initial
carbonation
that
settles
down
to
a
lazy
bubble
trail
looks
more
like
a
stout
really
smells
sweet
like
brandy
and
wood
taste
wallops
you
up
front
with
dark
roast
then
smooths
to
a
smoky
woody
taste
and
sweetness
that
is
really
nice
finishes
dry
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
lightly
carbonated
drinkability
is
good
but
the
whack
of
alcohol
makes
this
a
sipper
i
think
ill
go
see
how
this
holds
up
to
a
spicy
pepperoni
pizza
now
d
for
dessert
perhaps
limit
to
one
bottle
cheers
d
a
sipping
beer
to
be
savored
very
enjoyable
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
a
tan
head
rises
to
over
two
fingers
the
tan
foam
recedes
to
a
ring
and
stays
throughout
some
lace
is
left
behind
a
surprisingly
reserved
aroma
sweet
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
boozy
alcohol
all
the
good
stuff
is
there
i
just
wish
the
aroma
was
bigger
i
have
to
stick
my
nose
in
the
snifter
and
and
take
a
deep
breath
to
get
anything
the
flavor
is
huge
however
a
rich
malty
flavor
chocolate
vanilla
creamy
espresso
and
some
rum
like
alcohol
a
full
body
that
is
low
on
the
carbonation
very
rich
creamy
and
velvety
smooth
the
alcohol
shows
but
it
is
a
great
beer
to
sip
a
great
beer
ill
be
buying
this
again
taste
is
as
complex
as
the
smell
any
hint
of
booze
noticed
in
the
aroma
is
absent
on
the
palate
lots
of
complex
malt
flavors
slightly
roasted
caramel
vanilla
burnt
sugar
a
bit
of
spiciness
bittersweet
cocoa
some
fruit
kind
of
berry
like
and
there
is
also
a
very
faint
scotchlike
peat
smokiness
about
as
perfect
of
a
mouthfeel
as
you
will
find
it
is
full
bodied
and
creamy
with
a
perfect
carbonation
level
a
very
complex
and
interesting
beer
a
high
price
tag
will
keep
me
from
purchasing
this
a
lot
but
i
will
pick
it
up
again
at
some
point
verdict
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
they
certainly
didnt
go
unfulfilled
palo
santo
marron
is
a
big
bad
brew
with
plenty
of
complexity
and
personality
coming
from
the
wood
and
booze
a
twelve
percent
brown
ale
aged
on
exotic
paraguayan
wood
is
the
kind
of
madness
weve
come
to
expect
and
the
result
is
just
as
good
too
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
ages
in
the
cellar
this
beer
reminded
me
more
of
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
personally
i
think
this
was
a
good
beer
but
i
probably
would
not
have
again
upon
sipping
flavors
of
rye
bread
dark
fruit
and
shelled
nuts
are
most
evident
about
a
quarter
into
the
glass
i
figured
out
that
what
palo
santo
most
reminds
me
of
is
a
belgian
dubbel
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
almost
like
syrup
or
cream
on
the
tongue
alcohol
leaves
the
mouth
tingling
but
its
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
taste
much
to
my
surprise
while
it
does
sip
like
a
bigger
beer
i
found
it
extremely
drinkable
nicely
done
dfh
the
pour
into
my
pint
glass
revealed
a
very
dark
beer
with
tan
head
as
i
took
a
whiff
of
the
beer
i
noticed
a
port
like
smell
which
lead
me
to
expect
a
very
sweet
wine
like
taste
the
first
taste
that
i
took
i
got
the
initial
kick
in
the
teeth
that
a
12
beer
gives
but
after
the
initial
alcoholic
burn
gave
way
i
started
to
taste
a
depth
of
flavor
vanilla
woody
slight
roastedness
it
aint
yer
average
beer
especially
as
the
temperature
of
the
beer
warms
do
the
flavors
really
start
to
come
out
and
the
initial
burn
of
the
12
starts
to
mellow
greatly
34
thru
the
pint
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
really
popping
and
theres
such
an
earthiness
to
it
which
really
masks
the
potency
hardly
any
semblence
of
a
high
octane
beer
here
its
a
very
full
bodied
beer
with
layers
of
flavor
profiles
the
mouthfeel
is
obviously
on
the
full
bodied
side
but
isnt
like
syrup
this
leads
to
the
drinkability
of
this
bad
boy
despite
its
high
percentage
of
alcohol
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
as
it
warms
in
temperature
the
balanced
complex
flavors
and
undaunting
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
worthy
to
frequent
consumption
however
moderation
should
be
taken
into
account
a
good
beer
and
a
very
nice
surprise
for
a
beer
which
on
paper
seems
very
eclectic
drinkability
excellent
will
buy
more
d
definitely
high
on
the
alcohol
content
but
given
the
way
it
tastes
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
more
than
9
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
that
i
would
like
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
its
richness
and
price
make
it
more
of
a
special
occasion
beer
d
drinks
like
a
fine
wine
at
12
0abv
youll
feel
the
dark
vinous
nature
and
warmth
this
has
to
offer
as
well
a
deep
layering
and
complexity
warm
this
up
in
a
chalice
for
best
results
a
slow
sipper
that
will
have
you
excited
with
every
sip
until
the
last
when
you
realize
that
you
are
out
d
wow
this
is
a
good
freakin
beer
i
can
imagine
enjoying
this
brew
with
some
highend
chocolate
or
some
smoked
gouda
or
havarti
cheese
maybe
a
nice
aged
cheddar
this
is
very
likely
to
become
a
fallwinter
staple
at
the
jhoban19
household
drinkablityoverall
i
could
really
get
used
to
having
this
often
i
love
the
smell
so
much
that
i
dont
want
to
finish
this
glass
off
im
smelling
it
more
than
my
girlfriend
smells
her
hair
after
she
showers
with
a
new
shampoo
this
is
my
last
one
but
i
will
definitely
be
picking
it
up
again
if
i
see
it
all
and
all
a
great
beer
i
highly
reccomend
it
in
dogfish
head
glasses
the
wood
itself
lets
it
to
making
the
12
beer
more
smooth
just
as
in
a
12
year
old
scotch
is
more
smooth
d
very
enjoyable
im
glad
i
bought
a
4
pack
due
to
its
heavy
feel
and
alcohol
content
though
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
1
at
a
time
picked
this
one
up
at
cbx
had
to
get
a
growler
of
it
dfh
has
finally
arrived
in
chucktown
for
a
beer
thats
12
theres
hardly
any
trace
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
that
has
all
the
makings
of
a
dangerous
beer
if
your
not
careful
i
do
like
the
taste
though
had
a
kind
of
a
molassesmuttysmokey
malt
taste
going
on
the
smell
revealed
the
alcohol
a
bit
more
and
also
had
a
nice

it

not

this

got
to

another

dfh
pushing
the

and
another

i
really
wish
id
bought
two
this
was
from

i
could
see
what
a

would

you

here
this
might
pair

with

again
all

the
flavor
is
equally

lots
of

such
as

and
caramel
with
a
complex
sweetness
that
lingers
and
plenty
of

the

the

funk

this

the
presence
and
mouthfeel
of
it

there
after

it
didnt
detract
from
the

at

limited
my

a

i
would
probably
split
this

with

a
very

that
is
well

definitely

but
if
booziness
is
not
your
thing
it
may
turn
you
off
no
matter
what
though
it
is
unquestionably
impressive
kudos
to
dfh
for
this
tasty
number
it
was
nice
to
drink
a
beer
of
this
style
which
didnt
taste
like
i
was
drinking
a
cup
of
coffee
laced
with
alcohol
as
so
many
others
do
i
cant
say
this
is
a
beer
id
care
to
have
more
than
one
of
in
one
sitting
but
it
was
enjoyable
and
one
which
in
the
right
situation
id
have
again
md
soft
and
light
nice
sipper
but
watch
out
they
can
hurt
you
i
picked
up
a
growler
of
this
beer
on
my
way
out
liked
it
alot
this
beer
had
its
ups
and
downs
i
liked
the
smell
and
taste
perhaps
the
2
most
important
parts
but
wasnt
huge
on
the
rest
pours
dark
with
thinner
mocha
head
good
retention
no
lacing
smell
was
strong
on
vanilla
alcohol
toasted
and
dark
caramel
this
was
one
of
the
woodiest
beers
ive
ever
had
the
whole
woodoak
flavor
really
comes
through
in
the
taste
also
notice
the
vanilla
caramel
burnt
grain
and
dry
malt
a
very
warming
alcohol
burn
as
it
goes
down
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
velvety
texture
and
plesant
aftertaste
overall
a
good
beer
but
the
abv
was
just
too
high
and
the
alcohol
came
through
quite
dramatically
on
this
beer
d
this
may
be
classified
as
a
brown
ale
by
dfh
but
it
has
no
business
being
called
a
brown
ale
its
more
like
a
strong
ale
but
can
come
across
in
some
ways
like
a
ris
i
loved
having
the
opportunity
of
trying
it
it
is
definitely
a
great
beer
but
its
too
sweet
and
tangy
and
heavy
in
alcohol
for
my
personal
taste
at
12abv
the
beer
is
in
the
drivers
seat
not
the
poor
fool
who
is
sipping
it
you
have
to
give
it
a
try
its
one
of
those
beers
that
makes
you
reevaluate
what
beers
are
and
can
be
dfh
may
be
surrounded
by
ridiculous
hype
but
drinking
a
brew
like
this
reminds
me
that
their
brand
reputation
is
built
on
some
real
beer
making
prowess
and
pioneering
spirit
d
so
very
drinkable
but
such
a
high
alcohol
content
i
may
need
a
taxi
after
a
few
of
these
d
pretty
good
nice
beer
im
really
happy
i
got
to
try
it
and
i
will
be
seeking
it
out
again
soon
great
beer
d
this
beer
is
very
unique
and
extremely
complex
it
is
very
enjoyable
but
the
12
abv
is
easily
the
limiting
factor
not
so
much
in
an
overbearing
taste
but
in
the
compromised
ability
for
me
to
continue
standing
drinkability
12
really
did
not
notice
or
taste
it
at
all
i
tried
a
12
ounce
bottle
of
palo
santo
marron
brewed
by
dogfish
head
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
an
overwhelming
aroma
of
wood
enticed
my
flavor
sensors
the
appearance
was
the
same
as
any
aged
brown
ale
but
the
aroma
was
absolutely
incredible
the
paraguayan
palo
santo
wood
truly
made
for
a
unique
holy
experience
this
is
yet
another
great
beer
from
the
definition
of
american
breweries
dogfish
head
the
initial
almost
over
barring
flavor
of
burnt
sweet
wood
hits
the
tip
of
your
tongue
then
as
the
alcohol
starts
to
tingle
a
wonderful
caramel
and
vanilla
flavor
comes
out
this
beer
would
work
perfectly
with
a
nice
steak
drinkability
well
one
was
definitely
enough
but
this
isnt
the
type
of
beer
youd
want
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
anyway
great
sipping
beer
and
one
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
would
make
a
great
substitute
for
when
im
craving
a
stout
anytime
glad
i
had
this
very
nice
dark
brown
deep
in
color
scent
was
sweet
to
the
nose
hints
of
vinilla
and
sweet
malts
taste
was
powerful
reminded
me
of
a
after
dinner
beer
very
sweet
and
smooth
no
more
than
one
flavors
start
to
be
over
powering
one
thing
that
stand
out
was
a
nice
head
for
a
bit
to
good
lacing
on
my
glass
cheers
d
definitely
dont
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
due
to
the
abv
its
a
bit
hot
but
not
as
bad
as
youd
expect
with
the
12
i
loved
the
story
about
sam
caglione
building
a
giant
barrel
out
of
this
exotic
and
aromatic
wood
seek
and
consume
bring
wws
and
60
minute
to
ca
please
cheers
d
could
be
dangerous
i
think
this
aged
well
and
rounded
some
of
the
edges
this
becomes
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
two
more
sips
the
warmth
accentuates
the
beauty
of
the
flavor
the
darker
winelike
notes
expand
the
fruitiness
and
vanilla
morph
into
a
danker
representation
one
more
sip
i
close
my
eyes
the
flavor
becomes
even
more
robust
and
seductive
it
is
like
an
acid
trip
for
my
tongue
and
nose
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
even
though
its
something
id
really
only
want
every
few
months
drink
is
decent
at
12
i
really
couldnt
see
to
many
drinking
more
than
the
four
recommended
this
beer
pours
very
dark
near
stout
territory
with
a
small
tan
head
a
little
lacing
and
low
carbonation
the
smell
is
big
of
chocolate
covered
raisans
and
orange
zest
the
tast
is
big
and
bold
which
i
come
to
expect
from
dfh
some
chocolate
notes
definately
getting
a
little
raisan
flavor
as
well
as
caramel
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
this
beer
could
use
some
more
time
to
age
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
a
low
carbonation
level
and
for
12
this
is
ver
drinkable
this
is
one
i
can
spend
almost
an
hour
enjoying
which
i
routinely
do
at
their
pub
there
is
nothing
better
than
spending
an
hour
watching
a
game
and
nursing
a
glass
of
this
stuff
best
sipping
beer
of
all
the
dfh
in
my
opinion
except
maybe
the
world
wide
stout
this
beer
is
so
good
and
so
expensive
it
is
going
to
be
my
ruin
d
although
this
is
good
drinkability
is
low
much
like
other
dfh
beers
the
alcohol
is
very
high
for
the
style
this
makes
it
a
slow
sipper
overall
impression
interesting
example
of
what
wood
flavor
can
impart
to
beer
this
beer
has
an
interesting
story
behind
it
and
plenty
of
flavor
to
back
it
up
feel
was
big
and
thick
very
coating
took
my
time
with
it
drinkability
was
good
for
what
it
is
i
wouldnt
want
another
right
away
but
i
will
get
it
again
surprisingly
drinkable
even
given
the
high
alcohol
i
have
7
more
so
curious
to
see
how
they
are
over
time
this
is
what
makes
me
want
to
be
a
brewer
d
the
hugeness
of
this
brew
and
its
insane
abv
make
it
a
definite
sipper
but
its
amazing
complexity
of
rich
flavor
and
aroma
accompanied
by
warming
alcohol
make
every
swig
different
and
interesting
this
beer
pours
so
dark
that
light
cannot
penetrate
it
i
literally
took
a
flashlight
to
the
glass
to
see
if
the
lght
could
me
give
a
glimpse
of
the
beers
true
color
it
is
an
extremely
dark
brownred
almost
no
head
at
all
what
did
form
was
very
thin
and
dark
pours
thick
smell
is
pleasant
i
detect
an
undestated
smokey
malt
scent
although
not
overwhleming
i
expected
more
woody
aromas
especially
considering
the
hype
around
the
wood
tanks
i
read
so
much
about
taste
to
this
drinker
was
very
similar
to
a
porter
earthy
malty
but
you
defnitely
get
some
wood
flavoring
and
a
subtle
spice
on
the
tongue
and
throat
mouthfeel
was
suprising
very
complex
almost
oily
with
light
spice
sort
of
coats
the
mouth
and
hangs
around
the
taste
lingers
a
long
while
drinkability
is
not
high
at
least
not
for
this
beer
guy
while
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
i
found
it
very
tough
to
drink
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
its
got
a
strong
personality
a
good
beer
very
well
crafted
but
not
my
personal
favorite
style
this
beer
is
simply
amazing
its
is
almost
totally
opaque
which
for
a
brown
ale
is
a
little
suprising
and
has
little
head
the
nose
is
somewhat
subdued
there
is
a
strong
woody
note
there
which
is
interesting
but
not
overly
evocative
the
real
strength
here
is
in
the
taste
this
beer
is
big
oily
dark
and
woody
to
the
extreme
i
have
never
had
another
beer
that
covers
the
mouth
in
the
way
that
this
one
does
it
literally
seems
to
coat
your
palate
for
a
good
few
minutes
an
exceptional
beer
one
of
the
tastiest
i
have
ever
had
well
worth
the
price
and
a
definite
rebuy
whoa
this
is
a
sipper
of
the
highest
order
each
sip
demands
your
attention
as
you
work
through
the
flavors
and
the
alcohol
this
is
not
a
complaint
and
the
beer
is
quite
a
good
one
and
quite
unique
but
more
than
one
edit
ok
maybe
2
of
these
would
have
to
be
quite
the
night
like
most
beginning
beer
drinkers
i
was
first
drawn
to
dogfish
head
because
of
the
big
bold
flavors
and
their
reputation
for
offcenteredness
i
still
think
theyre
a
great
company
but
over
the
years
i
kind
of
got
sick
of
the
90min
the
120
and
wws
and
all
their
zany
ingredients
in
general
i
guess
i
was
feeling
antiextreme
and
i
just
wanted
a
wellcrafter
beer
with
4
ingredients
a
friend
recently
suggested
this
beer
to
me
again
and
its
renewed
my
interest
pours
a
thicklooking
opaque
brown
with
head
of
small
bubbles
this
beer
has
so
much
character
initially
sweet
and
malty
with
brown
sugar
and
licorice
notes
not
much
bitterness
to
this
beer
at
all
but
its
rounded
out
by
a
very
bold
and
robust
woodsyness
imparted
from
the
palo
santo
barrels
built
specifically
to
make
this
beer
this
is
the
main
attraction
here
carmel
nutty
and
almost
a
bit
smoky
lush
and
smooth
on
the
palate
a
really
interesting
beer
that
i
tend
to
drink
towards
the
end
of
the
night
quite
relaxing
also
its
worth
checking
out
the
video
about
this
beer
if
you
can
find
it
online
pretty
cool
cheers
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
with
this
abv
im
not
having
more
than
one
an
evening
this
beer
should
be
in
a
style
category
by
itself
drinkability
i
realize
the
palo
santo
wood
is
the
feature
of
this
brew
unfortunately
its
not
my
thing
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
wont
be
revisiting
it
love
this
beer
steep
price
but
have
you
ever
tried
to
build
a
barrel
out
of
palo
santo
wood
pricy
endevour
right
there
first
impressions
are
huge
and
this
beer
looks
gorgeous
shine
a
flashlight
on
the
other
end
of
the
glass
and
id
bet
that
you
wouldnt
get
any
light
on
the
other
side
it
pours
and
looks
like
a
great
stout
with
a
dark
tan
head
that
stays
around
the
smell
is
slightly
tinged
with
alcohol
but
thats
to
be
expected
from
a
12percenter
other
scents
i
get
include
sweetness
almost
like
an
orange
and
vanilla
when
i
taste
this
its
very
reminiscent
of
a
very
strong
sweet
stout
the
sweetness
compliments
the
alcohol
very
well
drinkability
is
slightly
low
due
to
the
thickness
and
high
alcohol
but
this
obviously
was
never
intended
to
be
a
session
brew
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
among
the
best
ive
had
from
dogfish
drinkability
for
a
brown
ale
its
very
bold
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavors
i
like
the
flavor
but
its
strength
keeps
it
to
one
or
two
before
moving
on
to
something
a
bit
lighter
definitely
a
good
choice
to
have
with
some
pub
food
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
loved
it
so
much
more
than
the
second
time
maybe
i
was
just
so
caught
up
in
the
story
of
the
beer
i
swore
i
could
taste
the
wood
which
was
much
less
apparent
this
time
still
liked
just
not
in
love
boy
250
characters
is
a
lot
pretty
bold
flavors
from
this
beer
which
i
like
definitely
could
only
drink
one
or
two
at
a
time
though
but
at
this
high
abv
thats
prolly
all
i
would
need
overall
an
excellent
brew
for
casual
sipping
its
thick
yet
smooth
dark
yet
mild
something
yet
well
something
else
just
try
it
dangit
had
this
on
tap
at
the
rotten
apple
in
grafton
this
is
really
dark
for
a
so
called
brown
ale
it
had
a
rich
smell
and
appearance
but
it
was
much
sweeter
than
i
like
it
would
have
gone
well
with
food
as
it
was
almost
winelike
a
good
beer
just
not
my
style
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass
beer
is
darker
than
i
was
expecting
from
a
brown
ale
there
is
a
good
bitterness
balance
but
no
hops
are
evident
the
bourbonesk
flavor
produced
from
the
wood
is
apparent
the
finale
is
a
big
hit
of
alcohol
that
really
wakes
you
up
and
reminds
you
that
youre
drinking
a
12
abv
beer
the
ethanol
tends
to
linger
as
well
as
the
dark
malty
flavors
but
in
a
much
more
subdued
role
than
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
what
you
might
expect
from
a
beer
this
big
full
bodied
with
a
creamy

lapsed
in
my
ratings
overall
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
i
know
the
last
one
is
always
the
best
but
this
is
no
joke
pick
it
up
quick
im
booking
my
delaware
beach
house
for
the
summer
now
mouthfeel
is
smooth
heavy
body
low
carbonation
sticky
no
ignoring
the
three
finger
head
when
poured
compresses
steadily
but
the
froth
can
be
spooned
out
by
hand
before
gone
completely
black
in
color
hard
to
find
any
variance
in
hue

drips
black
golden
raisins
dates
rum
cake
panseared
molasses
very
boozy
malted
milk
balls
sticks
like
glue
to
your
nostril
pores
some
notes
of
sharper
green
apple
thick
enough
texturally
that
you
enjoy
it
more
just
getting
steamrolled
than
trying
to
pick
this
apart
from
that
fullbodied
as
in
the
nose
you
feel
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
but
no
burn
nor
bite
all
about
roasted

plum
fruit
alternate

sweetness
carbonation
is
sneaky
strong
anything
which
can
stir
this
brew
has
muscles
a
touch
of
orange
or
grapefruit
at
the
end
reminds
you
that
hops
must
be
a
component
of
the
finished
product
cant
say
i
could
put
down
more
than
one
bottle
at
a
time
the
beer
equivalent
of
vintage
port
highly
reccomend
may
need
some
time
in
the
cellar
to
calm
things
down
cheers
overall
the
beer
is
super
rich
dark
brown
ale
the
beer
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
and
warming
the
finish
is
bitter
with
a
full
finish
i
can
taste
the
hops
in
the
beer
but
the
malt
is
a
bit
more
powerful
the
alcohol
is
very
strong
but
mellowed
out
in
the
beer
the
beer
is
very
flavorful
very
well
made
and
deserving
to
any
beer
enthusiast
this
beer
was
bottled
on
102308
i
guess
it
is
the
third
or
forth
batch
through
the
tanks
it
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
dark
tan
head
that
quickly
disappeared
the
smell
is
a
little
boozy
with
sweet
brown
sugar
dominating
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
taste
really
hides
the
alcohol
brown
sugar
then
quickly
followed
by
a
slightly
bitter
piney
flavor
the
bitterness
hangs
around
more
than
the
sweetness
i
like
the
way
the
taste
keeps
going
even
after
it
is
swallowed
normally
this
is
a
bad
thing
but
here
it
is
very
good
a
very
good
beer
the
smell
was
muted
the
taste
was
awesome
mouth
and
drinkability
very
good
i
tried
it
when
it
first
came
out
and
there
was
more
sweetness
now
it
is
on
the
bitter
side
drinkability
a
flavour
intense
experiencehides
the
alcohol
very
well
though
drinkable
i
drank
it
good
drinkability
albeit
the
12
00
abv
this
beer
left
me
baffled
i
dont
know
if
i
had
a
brown
ale
or
a
ris
smokey
malt
dominates
the
front
end
of
this
bottle
with
chocolate
and
alcohol
to
follow
in
between
there
is
some
almost
tart
flavor
i
cant
identify
but
i
like
it
has
a
great
mouthfeel
that
is
complex
but
yields
to
the
alcohol
this
is
one
of
the
few
really
interesting
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
ill
keep
a
few
in
the
basement
to
see
how
they
do
over
time
too
expensive
came
out
much
darker
than
i
expected
black
in
glass
with
zero
clarity
tan
creamy
head
not
much
lace
smell
is
acidic
in
a
good
way
dark
coffee
and
some
fruit
with
some
woodyness
showing
as
it
warms
taste
is
bitter
chocolate
up
front
with
some
smoother
cocoa
notes
to
follow
some
earthyness
as
it
goes
to
the
back
of
the
throat
and
it
finishes
slightly
bitter
alcohol
is
well
hidden
im
guessing
that
it
shows
in
the
some
of
the
dark
fruityness
it
does
have
a
warming
feeling
as
you
drink
it
down
a
real
sipper
with
one
being
enough
for
a
night
well
worth
a
try
and
id
have
to
say
that
overall
its
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
from
dogfish
d
i
wish
i
was
more
familiar
with
palo
santo
wood
so
i
would
be
better
at
detecting
any
noticeable
flavors
nice
brown
ale
with
a
wonderful
taste
and
aroma
a
bit
high
on
the
alcohol
but
it
isnt
too
noticeable
d
this
beer
is
great
while
i
dont
get
the
brown
ale
classification
i
cant
take
that
away
from
this
great
beer
tastes
of
vanilla
and
caramel
remind
wallowing
in
my
mouth
finishes
very
well
and
is
quite
a
drinkable
brew
that
i
know
this
guy
will
continue
to
still
enjoy
wow
the
mouthfeel
of
this
one
is
superb
very
thick
smooth
and
sticky
coats
the
mouth
very
nice
d
oh
i
would
most
definitely
order
another
one
of
these
without
the
least
bit
of
armtwisting
notes
my
first
perfect
score
a
5
0
all
around
and
easily
my
favorite
dfh
beer
thick
rich
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
definite
viscous
feel
to
it
full
bodied
carbonation
is
spot
on
one
aspect
i
think
completes
this
brew
alcohol
is
warming
but
definitely
not
anything
crazy
a
fantastic
dessert
sipper
its
incredibly
complex
and
enjoyable
overall
an
ok
beer
from
an
overrated
brewery
while
i
appreciate
their
creativity
i
find
their
beers
usually
arent
for
me
heard
really
good
things
about
this
one
so
gave
them
another
shot
dont
recommend
unless
you
can
borrow
one
from
a
buddy
one
and
done
d
wow
this
is
some
beer
dfh
really
knows
how
to
make
a
beer
that
is
completely
different
and
this
one
is
a
raving
success
each
swallow
is
another
adventure
for
your
palate
great
stuff
the
only
thing
that
would
keep
me
from
having
too
many
would
be
getting
very
hammered
im
going
to
cellar
some
of
these
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
will
grow
with
age
this
is
a
very
nice
sipper
on
a
cold
day
not
a
beer
to
entertain
several
of
in
one
sitting
but
a
perfect
nite
cap
sweet
like
a
sherry
with
a
good
balance
of
flavor
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
hefty
tag
i
paid
124
pack
but
ive
seen
as
high
as
184
pack
that
notwithstanding
worth
seeking
out
and
enjoying
this
is
not
what
many
would
consider
your
typical
brown
ale
but
then
few
things
from
dfh
are
ever
typical
and
my
taste
buds
dont
seem
to
mind
the
information
on
the
lable
and
the
abv
should
dispell
the
notion
this
one
would
be
normal
i
love
brown
ales
this
is
much
more
like
a
stout
a
good
effort
but
not
my
favorite
form
dfh
a
syrupy
backbone
with
an
intense
amount
of
malt
flavors
dark
fruit
mixed
in
there
too
perhaps
prunes
or
raisins
with
light
chocolate
a
complex
beer
for
sure
with
some
alcohol
heat
a
tad
unbalanced
but
interesting
nevertheless
my
expectations
where
met
d
amust
have
for
any
extreme
beer
fan
though
the
gravity
is
high
the
alcohol
doesnt
interfere
with
the
deliciousness
of
this
brew
d
tasty
goes
down
dangerously
easily
not
too
filling
very
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
while
leaning
toward
being
a
stout
this
is
a
nice
highpowered
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
to
summarize
this
beer
probably
has
a
very
devoted
cult
following
but
other
than
that
minority
this
is
a
onetimer
or
at
best
a
once
in
a
while
when
the
mood
is
right
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
thin
tannish
head
smell
is
of
vanilla
and
some
slight
alcohol
can
be
sensed
very
unusual
taste
bit
very
good
taste
as
well
some
brown
sugar
and
more
vanilla
slight
alcohol
taste
can
be
tasted
but
it
is
quickly
subdued
by
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
nice
mouthfeel
to
it
and
good
finish
you
can
really
feel
it
warming
you
up
as
its
about
3
x
the
strength
of
the
average
beer
ive
been
dying
to
try
this
beer
and
a
long
day
of
shoveling
seemed
to
be
a
good
opportunity
to
enjoy
one
a
great
sipper
beer
that
is
an
enjoyable
12
oz
experience
a
little
pricey
tho

a

poured

reddish

almost

with
a
thin

redtan
head
that
disippated
to
a
thin
film
and
left
little

strong
aromas
of
sweet
malts
chocolate
and

complex
flavor
profile
featured
chocolate
and
dark

mostly
cherry
and
included
licorice
caramel
and
a
distinctive
fresh
wood
sensation
as
expected
medium
body
minimal
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
malt
aftertaste
very
little
in
terms
of
hops
bitterness
but
its
there
if
you
look
for
it
alcohol
is
evident
and
warming
the
palo
santo
wood
is
a
very
interesting
addition
and
makes
this
a
very
special
treat
definitely
on
my
top
5
enjoyed
ontap
at
tailgaters
in
orlando
pours
a
dark
gown
color
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
oak
very
nice
aroma
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
the
taste
like
the
aroma
is
very
malty
with
some
woodlike
notes
and
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
this
is
another
awesome
beer
from
dfh
that
is
recommended
d
while
i
will
praise
palo
santo
marron
for
being
another
unique
offering
from
dfh
it
is
almost
undrinkable
alcohol
aside
the
wood
is
just
too
much
judging
from
the
nose
there
are
other
things
going
on
in
this
brew
but
once
it
hits
the
tastebuds
the
wood
overpowers
most
anything
else
not
exactly
fit
to
style
this
is
still
an
interesting
beer
im
not
entirely
sure
one
could
call
this
a
brown
ale
but
it
definitely
tries
to
redefine
the
boundaries
of
the
style
its
a
sipping
brown
not
a
standard
easydrinking
brown
the
complexities
brought
on
by
barrelaging
are
enjoyable
with
this
brew
and
best
savored
slowly
thumbs
up
to
dfh
on
this
one
truth
be
told
i
did
not
care
for
this
during
the
first
bottling
but
i
have
grown
to
it
and
love
palo
santo
this
is
even
better
on
tap
and
i
will
never
pass
up
an
opportunity
to
try
it
that
way
great
innovation
by
dfh
once
again
im
glad
this
is
a
seasonal
now
the
palo
santo
marron
is
a
grand
experiment
in
the
microbrew
world
fortunately
the
resulting
beer
is
quite
tasty
indeed
and
definitely
not
like
any
other
beer
the
perfumey
aromas
of
the
wood
leap
out
of
the
glass
and
the
vanillacoffeetoffeecaramel
notes
weave
nicely
into
the
richness
of
the
strong
brown
ale
the
one
point
i
would
state
against
it
is
that
there
was
a
whiff
of
something
solventlike
nailpolish
remover
that
was
a
bit
offputting
this
is
a
fresh
new
avenue
for
brewing
just
because
a
particular
wood
isnt
traditionally
used
for
making
barrels
doesnt
mean
it
wouldnt
give
a
good
flavor
to
beer
the
body
is
big
and
sweet
sure
its
big
but
there
is
a
linger
sweetness
that
just
lingers
into
the
finish
carbonation
is
a
bit
light
which
might
help
the
balance
out
i
suppose
this
is
an
ager
but
really
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
and
why
a
us
brown
big
sweet
medicinal
woody
im
a
little
put
off
by
the
sweet
medicinal
flavor
in
this
beer
thats
my
main
thought
but
i
probably
had
too
high
of
hopes
for
this
one
palo
santo
marron
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
the
unique
woody
flavor
suffers
from
its
sweetness
for
my
palate
there
is
some
dryness
from
the
wood
but
the
mouthfeel
is
still
fairly
cloying
for
me
the
flavor
is
complex
and
there
are
some
good
notes
in
there
its
just
all
a
bit
too
much
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
forward
for
the
sweet
syrupy
feel
i
enjoy
the
beer
but
at
the
price
i
probably
wont
buy
one
again
soon
overall
another
great
off
centered
ale
that
seems
to
have
no
real
style
but
is
in
its
own
category
of
greatness
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
loves
beer
drinkability
while
the
flavors
seem
to
mellow
with
time
the
bitter
taste
seems
to
move
forward
on
the
palate
while
there
is
a
complexity
to
enjoy
the
beer
dominates
and
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
having
two
in
one
sitting
this
is
a
fantastic
unusual
and
unique
style
20
for
a
four
pack
is
pricey
but
you
would
pay
10
a
bottle
in
the
restaurant
or
bar
a
very
interesting
beer
we
have
here
very
dark
in
color
almost
black
but
not
impenetrable
medium
creamy
tan
head
rises
and
falls
to
a
ring
wow
big
nose
on
this
one
woody
and
soaked
in
vanilla
in
a
complimenting
fashion
not
overwhelming
by
any
means
caramel
chocolate
nice
coffee
presence
that
becomes
more
apparent
as
you
drink
sweet
and
lightly
tart
fruit
cherry
being
most
apparent
and
possibly
even
raspberry
very
tasty
here
surprisingly
low
level
of
heat
for
such
a
monster
of
a
beer
wide
range
of
flavors
and
well
balanced
nothing
is
distracting
or
in
your
face
woody
character
becomes
a
bit
more
apparent
imparting
a
slight
dryness
to
the
beer
personally
im
enjoying
it
a
moderate
sweetness
compliments
with
vanilla
caramel
and
coffee
most
apparent
fruit
here
still
also
damn
this
is
great
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
but
again
has
a
dryness
to
it
thanks
to
the
wood
a
little
tingle
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
i
easily
finished
a
single
12
oz
serving
might
consider
two
intriguing
beer
as
are
many
that
dfh
tends
to
put
out
thankfully
this
one
works
well
might
be
time
to
pick
up
a
4pack
and
set
a
few
aside
recommended
drinkability
very
good
considering
the
12
goes
down
easy
with
a
good
pinch
in
the
aftertaste
but
really
if
you
read
and
remember
one
thing
about
what
ive
said
in
this
review
just
remember
i
should
try
this
if
ive
seen
it
and
never
had
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
beers
body
is
full
and
creamy
the
alcohol
is
present
and
announces
itself
with
authority
i
love
the
experimental
beers
dogfishhead
makes
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
experience
thanks
i
want
to
get
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
to
cellar
for
a
good
length
of
time
to
see
how
this
changes
i
imagine
that
it
will
become
extremely
tasty
it
took
me
awhile
to
warm
up
to
this
one
the
pour
offered
very
little
head
which
quickly
dissipated
the
aroma
was
that
of
almost
a
dry
wine
with
a
hint
of
a
woody
and
fruity
smell
after
about
three
or
four
sips
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
did
enjoy
its
drinkability
but
wouldnt
rush
back
to
have
another
all
in
all
enjoyable
but
not
worth
the
hype
well
its
drinkable
but
by
no
means
a
session
beer
one
or
two
is
enough
nice
dessert
beer
great
to
share
drinkability
yes
indeed
cheers
beertracker
if
i
had
the
patience
this
would
have
been
aged
this
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
reddish
tints
and
a
single
finger
of
tan
head
that
disappears
readily
the
smell
is
prunes
dates
and
an
intense
wood
essence
that
i
admit
i
cannot
identify
beyond
the
description
on
the
label
the
taste
is
floral
hops
heavy
black
fruit
caramel
vanilla
and
an
acrid
woodiness
again
hard
to
describe
the
carbonation
is
quite
low
and
the
finish
carries
on
the
heavy
woody
sweetness
the
body
is
very
thick
and
viscous
with
obvious
alcohol
warming
it
sticks
to
the
palate
making
this
a
slow
if
exotically
tasty
tipple
this
bottle
was
about
4
months
old
stoutdark
small
brown
head
smells
very
sweet
some
black
cherry
fruitness
and
the
palo
santo
woodiness
taste
teeters
on
the
rim
of
an
imperial
stout
nothing
like
any
other
brown
ale
ive
had
sweetness
is
thankfully
much
subdued
by
the
hop
bitterness
but
still
finishes
nicely
sweet
the
beer
ends
very
dry
with
the
pleasant
taste
of
the
wood
pretty
chewy
mouthfeel
but
not
as
thick
as
bells
expedition
for
example
medium
carbonation
i
used
this
beer
as
chaser
for
some
speyside
scotch
i
dont
think
there
could
have
been
a
better
pairing
one
of
dfhs
best
i
am
very
happy
they
have
a
lot
invested
in
the
regular
production
of
this
beer
i
will
buy
it
frequently
and
serve
it
to
others
with
confidence
it
is
very
very
strong
i
could
not
emagine
having
more
than
one
it
was
nice
to
try
a
creative
beer
such
as
this
i
would
likely
not
buy
this
one
again
not
that
it
is
bad
just
not
for
me
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
finer
woodaged
beers
that
ive
had
i
cant
help
but
wonder
what
other
beers
could
gain
from
some
time
against
this
type
of
wood
the
simplicity
of
the
beer
and
complete
extravagance
of
production
make
this
an
excellent
buy
and
one
to
remember
taste
reminds
me
of
an
is
ris
from
the
get
go
guess
thats
the
abv
talking
as
this
is
an
extreme
brown
ale
not
as
sweet
or
chocolatey
as
an
ris
however
instead
offering
more
subtle
flavors
of
raisin
and
dried
cherry
with
complex
malt
undertones
this
might
be
interesting
with
some
belgian
yeast
thrown
into
the
mix
hint
hint
smooth
feel
and
drinks
easier
than
most
beers
of
this
weight
yet
there
are
few
beers
of
this
weight
pours
deep
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
some
lacing
on
the
surface
aroma
has
notes
of
chocolate
and
wood
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
very
rich
and
chocolaty
sweet
but
not
too
much
so
again
there
is
a
definite
wood
note
obviously
from
the
aging
some
nice
earthy
herbal
hops
in
the
finish
along
with
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
tasty
well
balanced
smooth
and
very
very
good
full
bodied
very
drinkable
for
the
strength
a
unique
and
excellent
beer
wow
a
lot
of
heat
and
sugary
syrup
in
this
one
one
to
be
reevaluated
in
the
future
after
it
gains
some
age
date
consumed
24
july
2008
d
this
is
sipper
for
sure
bc
of
the
high
abv
it
is
mighty
tasty
my
ears
are
strangely
warm
tm
very
smooth
thick
body
with
strong
carbonation
strong
alcohol
presence
but
lacks
burn
just
a
warming
presence
as
you
finish
the
bottle
flavor
isnt
overly
complex
but
very
rich
strong
alcohol
presence
and
body
has
prominent
flavors
from
the
wood
light
dark
fruit
flavors
providing
a
little
bitterness
some
vanilla
and
light
roasted
malt
when
you
let
it
warm
up
and
sit
in
the
mouth
a
stronger
nuttiness
and
almost
spicy
hot
peppery
flavor
starts
to
come
through
very
nicely
balanced
and
alcohol
is
certainly
present
at
12
but
not
overwhelming
comparing
this
to
traditional
brown
ales
is
kind
of
pointless
another
interesting
unique
beer
from
dfh
but
not
one
im
motivated
to
seek
out
at
this
price
frequently
d
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
its
not
too
bad
at
all
dont
see
myself
having
more
than
a
few
in
a
night
but
nonetheless
its
damn
good
d
not
really
sessionable
but
i
wanted
more
after
finishing
it
pours
an
extremely
dark
black
brown
colored
body
tan
colored
head
somewhat
lasting
alcoholy
aroma
dark
fruit
like
plum
and
raisin
very
strong
aroma
coffee
aroma
too
wood
and
toffee
sweet
spiciness
coffee
taste
with
a
strong
roasted
coffee
aftertaste
a
little
alcohol
wood
and
roasted
flavor
some
chocolately
sweetness
seriously
viscous
pour
with
a
think
dark
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
delicious
smell
of
alcohol
alcohol
soaked
dates
or
figs
and
molasses
dark
malty
think
mouth
feel
yet
a
clean
finish
with
touch
of
alcohol
molasses
and
chocolate
malt
flavors
with
a
touch
of
the
alcohol
soaked
dates
or
figs
this
is
an
amazing
beer
it
seems
described
best
as
similar
to
a
russian
imperial
stout
but
without
any
of
the
bitterness
or
sharpness
whatever
that
4500
on
the
janka
scale
palo
santo
wood
did
to
this
beer
it
was
well
done
i
look
forward
to
what
those
giant
beer
barrels
help
produce
next
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
its
very
drinkable
considering
the
12
percent
alcohol
level
i
bet
this
could
sneak
up
on
you
though
well
worth
trying
though
a
little
expensive
for
regular
drinking
my
wife
even
commented
on
the
smell
being
like
that
stuff
i
used
to
drink
from
those
blue
bottles
and
hey
i
liked
sipping
the
satb
this
tastes
more
like
a
beer
thoughand
a
tasty
beer
it
is
better
warmer
than
colder
nice
flavor
complexity
good
stuff
here
taste
is
delicious
pretty
intense
and
full
bodied
lots
of
sweet
malt
and
molasses
some
roastiness
and
dark
fruit
on
the
aftertaste
heavy
yet
slippery
mouthfeel
if
anything
its
slightly
too
sodalike
in
the
carbonation
but
that
doesnt
take
much
at
all
away
from
the
overall
flavor
strong
at
12
but
pretty
wellhidden
and
smooth
i
think
the
palo
santo
wood
aging
has
something
to
do
with
the
smoothness
of
this
brew
but
as
for
woody
flavors
im
not
detecting
a
whole
lot
theres
some
spiciness
though
this
beer
is
really
an
imperial
brown
ale
which
makes
it
pretty
darn
close
to
an
imperial
stout
though
i
guess
not
as
roasty
or
bitter
all
in
all
a
great
dogfish
brew
d
outstanding
this
may
be
next
on
my
home
draft
list
for
the
abv
and
the
intensity
this
brew
is
exremely
drinkable
this
is
the
best
from
dfh
that
i
have
had
to
date
another
great
beer
from
dog
fish
head
i
look
forward
to
what
they
come
out
with
next
less
than
a
finger
of
head
when
poured
into
a
duchesse
goblet
tan
foam
that
recedes
slowly
and
leaves
a
ring
lactic
aroma
with
some
banana
ester
from
the
yeast
and
slightly
roasty
reminds
me
of
a
bells
stout
rich
creamy
feel
earthy
roast
and
lactic
taste
not
getting
much
of
the
advertised
woodaging
abv
is
well
disguised
similar
to
bells
kalamazoo
stout
or
double
cream
good
but
not
worth
paying
a
premium
for
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
so
you
have
to
take
this
one
pretty
slow
in
addition
to
the
vanilla
i
would
think
that
the
wood
imparts
a
subtle
smokiness
that
really
helps
to
round
out
the
flavors
holding
it
all
together
through
the
drink
and
then
following
for
a
number
of
minutes
probably
the
best
brown
ive
ever
had
though
not
my
favorite
style
overall
id
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
this
beer
and
it
certainly
did
not
let
me
down
be
sure
to
give
this
one
a
shot
drinkability
is
good
as
i
will
buy
again
bad
as
wouldnt
have
too
many
at
once
defiantly
worth
hunting
some
down
to
try
though
quite
a
complex
beer
to
be
as
thick
as
it
is
its
quite
drinkable
still
complex
is
the
best
way
to
describe
this
one
well
worth
a
try
d
very
good
12
percent
kind
of
tough
to
justify
another
one
but
almost
have
to
most
definitely
an
extreme
brown
ale
much
more
a
stout
than
a
brown
ale
notes
of
molasses
wood
caramel
apple
and
a
bit
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
on
the
finish
a
fine
winter
beer
poured
black
and
oily
from
the
bottle
thin
head
finely
carbonated
abundant
flavors
with
plenty
of
sweet
that
is
nicely
balanced
by
the
hot
bitter
finish
a
very
nice
beer
but
one
is
enough
i
doubt
that
ill
give
very
many
5s
especially
to
domestics
but
i
wish
there
was
a
higher
score
available
for
this
of
course
we
all
know
about
the
specialized
wooden
tanks
that
are
used
in
the
brewing
process
certainly
much
logistics
in
the
process
but
worth
it
while
i
would
never
consider
this
to
be
a
daily
session
beer
way
too
much
complexity
it
is
one
i
would
break
out
for
special
occasions
one
is
plenty
of
these
and
i
doubt
i
would
buy
it
again
but
it
is
a
complex
interesting
beer
with
a
good
story
a
dark
mahogany
pour
with
a
tight
tan
head
lacing
and
retention
struggle
to
survive
the
high
abv
rich
smell
of
raisins
malts
cherries
and
rum
as
the
beer
begins
to
warm
caramel
chocolate
rum
and
raisins
come
alive
in
the
flavor
tastes
very
similar
to
a
ris
but
is
lighter
and
more
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
creamy
and
smooth
for
a
12
abv
this
feels
very
tame
a
masterpiece
from
dfh
could
be
their
best
last
quater
of
the
brew
was
a

great
beer
i
will
enjoy
this
again
regardless
of
the
high
price
5
id
love
to
age
some
wow
as
i
continue
to
drink
it
im
impressed
by
its
substantial
body
but
its
got
no
hard
malt
bite
to
it
just
a
big
soft
body
okay
that
sounds
funny
this
is
an
exceptional
brew
the
complexities
are
amazing
and
only
increase
as
the
beer
warms
i
think
the
last
sip
is
the
best
in
the
bottle
it
makes
me
want
to
open
another
immediately
but
at
12
i
might
wait
a
couple
minutes
whoa
so
strong
and
tasty
but
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
would
love
to
sip
on
more
of
these
poured
black
wsome
dark
brown
when
held
to
the
light
into
a
dfh
goblet
clear
minimal
light
brown
head
nose
was
raisins
molasses
cocoa
roasted
nuts
and
aged
rum
taste
follows
suit
with
big
malt
sweetness
dominating
minimal
hop
presence
yet
somehow
manages
not
to
be
too
cloying
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
hugely
thick
and
viscous
very
lightly
carbonated
smooth
lingering
finish
this
would
make
a
fine
pairing
with
a
big
meaty
cigar
definitely
a
sipper
a
bit
much
boozy
alcohol
and
slick
for
me
the
taste
resembles
a
local
porter
that
i
enjoy
with
some
coffee
aftertaste
and
plenty
of
awesome
a
larger
pull
from
my
glass
punishes
me
with
a
little
bit
of
an
alcohol
taste
but
im
not
complaining
id
definitely
recommend
it
to
a
dark
beer
lover
are
you
gonna
finish
yours
solid
brown
pour
just
a
tiny
bit
of
brown
head
rose
up
not
much
in
the
nose
of
this
one
after
it
warmed
a
little
slight
roasted
caramelnutwhisky
barrel
pretty
malty
but
not
too
much
so
roasted
slightly
sweet
nuttiness
going
down
warmed
me
up
but
the
alcohol
was
not
apparent
at
all
pretty
darn
good
im
cellaring
2
of
the
bottles
curious
to
see
what
happens
finally
found
this
beer
at
the
local
liquor
store
snatched
it
up
quickly
and
made
my
exit
been
looking
for
this
for
a
while
the
pour
holy
crap
this
stuff
is
darker
than
i
first
thought
pours
like
motor
oil
as
the
aroma
fills
the
room
dark
solid
black
with
a
thin
head
one
of
the
darkest
brown
heads
ive
yet
seen
on
a
beer
leaves
a
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
that
dissipates
over
time
first
smell
so
many
different
notes
that
i
have
to
take
multiple
sniffs
aroma
is
of
roasted
coffee
vanilla
beans
ginger
lots
of
wood
nuts
with
a
scent
like
this
i
cant
wait
to
taste
it
first
sip
very
malty
a
bit
sour
lots
of
brown
ale
taste
and
some
toastiness
of
a
porter
in
there
as
well
sweet
notes
and
a
lot
of
spicy
ground
pepper
feel
on
the
finish
that
leaves
the
mouth
a
bit
tingly
this
is
a
fantastic
experience
going
in
depth
with
the
flavors
lots
of
sweet
ginger
toasted
woody
malt
roasted
coffee
chocolate
some
hop
bitterness
there
as
well
as
i
get
acquainted
with
this
beer
fruit
notes
plum
raisin
other
dark
fruits
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
there
is
so
much
to
talk
about
this
is
by
far
the
most
complex
beer
ive
ever
had
the
kicker
for
me
is
the
spicy
finish
along
with
the
severe
alcohol
warming
effect
without
any
semblence
of
an
alcohol
bite
whatsoever
even
at
13
abv
this
is
a
superb
perfectly
made
beer
i
have
yet
to
try
one
better
and
it
will
probably
be
some
time
until
i
will
this
beer
is
as
close
to
perfect
as
ive
ever
tasted
i
cant
gush
enough
about
this
beer
as
a
dark
beer
fan
this
one
was
right
up
my
alley
dark
hue
like
a
stout
flavors
similar
to
a
coffeehouse
porter
but
more
mysterious
every
sip
was
a
new
adventure
in
taste
the
12
abv
put
me
to
sleep
but
i
had
sweet
dreams
like
visions
of
sugar
plums
dancing
in
my
head
pours
a
dark
blackcola
brown
with
a
creamy
head
it
was
almost
like
a
blend
of
a
brown
ale
and
an
imperial
stout
the
aroma
was
of
coffee
slight
chocolate
a
woody
earthiness
and
very
strong
alcohol
the
more
i
drink
dfh
beers
the
more
i
realize
i
have
a
problem
with
them
when
they
go
above
9
abv
to
me
and
the
other
person
i
split
the
4
pack
with
the
booze
was
not
hidden
very
well
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
thick
drinkability
for
me
was
low
d
sessionability
at
12
abv
is
questionable
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
when
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
2007
extreme
beer
fest
my
girlfriend
and
i
both
felt
this
beer
won
the
night
in
the
bottle
and
mass
produced
though
it
seems
to
have
fallen
a
bit
very
tasty
but
definitely
a
one
bottle
sipper
poured
into
a
conical
pint
nearly
black
appearance
with
a
faint
brownish
head
which
dissipated
quickly
but
not
completely
smells
of
malt
and
earth
alcohol
comes
through
even
at
cooler
temperature
nearly
overwhelms
once
its
warmed
taste
is
big
on
sweet
malt
followed
by
wood
and
stone
fruit
mouthfeel
is
amazing
rich
and
silky
if
this
beer
was
at
7
or
8
abv
it
could
be
a
favorite
but
the
high
alcohol
does
take
away
from
overall
drinkability
this
one
is
strong
malty
and
high
alcohol
its
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
isnt
meant
to
be
sessioned
overall
i
found
it
very
enjoyable
the
palo
santo
gave
the
beer
a
woodiness
that
was
distinct
from
other
barrel
aged
beers
that
ive
had
before
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
give
it
a
try
ill
probably
pick
up
a
couple
more
bottles
to
see
how
this
one
does
in
the
cellar
this
was
very
complex
and
tasty
it
might
benefit
ffrom
12
months
in
the
cellar
the
head
disappeared
very
quickly
leaving
no
head
almost
instantly
the
smell
is
coffee
caramel
chocolate
slight
wood
and
alcohol
the
flavor
was
very
heavy
coffee
upfront
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
finishing
with
light
smoke
and
oak
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
out
being
to
gummy
with
the
high
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
drinkability
in
my
mind
is
maybe
one
snifter
at
a
session
this
brew
pours
up
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
chocolate
colored
head
that
disappeared
in
a
matter
of
seconds
the
nose
is
big
malts
subtle
chocolate
spices
some
alcohol
spice
wood
wow
a
very
different
beer
i
taste
earth
wood
lots
of
spice
malts
very
dry
full
bodied
medium
to
heavy
spritzy
carbo
not
a
bad
beer
just
different
drinkability
is
very
high
this
tasted
great
and
went
down
very
smooth
this
beer
arrived
at
my
table
with
a
thin
brown
collar
and
a
skim
of
fine
bubbles
coating
the
top
it
was
very
dark
brown
with
faint
edges
and
put
a
lot
of
fine
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
quite
fruity
lots
of
fig
and
prune
with
a
bit
of
red
wine
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
toffee
plus
a
bit
of
vanilla
sturdy
bitterness
yet
still
balanced
towards
sweetness
with
lots
of
dried
fruit
and
toffee
throughout
quite
rich
overall
nicely
integrated
wood
and
tannin
character
it
finished
with
dark
chocolate
and
alcohol
full
bodied
a
bit
heavy
with
lowish
carbonation
and
mild
warmth
very
smooth
with
fine
bubbles
giving
it
a
pleasant
texture
pretty
tasty
stuff
and
id
have
never
guess
the
abv
based
solely
on
the
beer
in
my
glass
knowing
dfh
this
shouldnt
have
been
a
surprise
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
overt
booziness
and
lack
of
nuance
this
was
painful
for
me
to
finish
even
a
12
oz
bottle
by
the
last
12
it
was
really
burning
me
up
i
could
feel
it
from
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
the
bottom
of
my
belly
im
sure
tomorrow
morning
will
be
real
fun
maybe
ill
get
one
or
two
for
long
term
cellar
just
to
see
if
it
softens
up
enough
after
23
years
but
im
unimpressed
enough
that
im
in
no
hurry
to
do
so
tap
obriens
pours
black
with
red
highlights
no
head
aroma
of
chocolate
vanilla
wood
and
earth
flat
mouthfeel
more
wood
and
earth
in
the
flavor
but
a
very
nice
malt
backbone
carob
and
some
smoke
make
this
very
pleasant
definitely
a
sipper
12
and
its
fairly
easy
to
drink
so
be
careful
a
great
twist
on
the
american
brown
ale
style
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
overall
pretty
interesting
and
unique
but
drifts
almost
into
the
realm
of
imperial
stouts
not
as
unique
as
i
was
expecting
and
is
pretty
off
style
for
an
american
brown
ale
although
that
is
to
be
expected
from
dfh
many
of
these
ratings
started
off
lower
but
as
i
picked
apart
the
aspects
of
this
beer
i
realized
that
i
could
not
in
good
conscience
rate
some
of
them
less
than
perfect
this
beer
surprised
and
amazed
me
very
much
i
highly
recommend
it
to
everyone
get
your
hands
on
this
crazy
thing
this
is
simply
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
ever
consumed
im
honestly
still
not
sure
if
i
think
it
is
really
good
or
merely
above
average
i
am
going
to
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
for
now
simply
because
it
is
so
unique
and
i
think
must
be
tried
by
beer
lovers
it
give
a
new
meaning
to
beer
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
want
to
invest
in
a
whole
4pack
on
an
often
basis
cheers
to
dogfish
for
a
truly
mindbending
beer
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
this
beer
stands
up
pretty
well
id
go
for
it
again
drinkability
low
at
first
but
it
improved
as
the
beer
warmed
up
this
was
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
turkey
and
stuffing
and
most
definitely
a
sipping
beer
overall
really
unlike
anything
else
i
gave
it
a
half
point
for
originality
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
seeing
what
a
couple
of
years
in
the
cellar
will
do
for
it
can
only
drink
one
of
these
bad
boys
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
poured
a
rich
motor
oil
black
with
a
moderate
brown
head
and
thick
gluey
lacing
big
nose
of
ripe
fruit
oak
alcohol
and
raisins
very
rich
and
creamy
mouthfeel
flavor
is
very
rich
is
well
with
molasses
vanilla
added
to
what
was
in
the
nose
dry
finish
very
drinkable
simply
fantastic
stuff
glad
i
have
three
more
great
twist
on
this
brew
by
dfh
very
enjoyable
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
great
example
of
wood
ageing
a
must
try
overall
a
dud
as
far
as
beers
go
if
i
wanted
something
that
can
only
be
described
as
wine
syrup
i
wouldnt
look
for
it
in
a
beer
not
sure
what
the
brewer
was
trying
to
do
with
this
one

overall
a
very
interesting
very
very
different
beer
that
i
enjoy
quite
a
bit
just
not
right
now
this
would
be
great
in
the
dead
of
winter
not
june
im
going
to
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
to
hold
onto
for
a
few
years
i
think
this
would
age
pretty
nicely
well
worth
picking
up
and
trying
for
the
price
for
as
thick
as
it
looks
its
has
a
nice
body
a
creamy
fluff
in
the
mouth
the
alcohol
content
in
this
a
very
deceiving
because
the
brew
has
such
a
mellow
taste
slow
roasted
coffee
with
a
hearty
amount
of
vanilla
and
a
dash
of
maple
syrup
a
kiss
of
hops
in
the
finish
and
a
nice
warming
in
the
chest
as
it
goes
down
theres
quite
a
few
levels
of
complexities
from
start
to
finish
so
the
high
end
booze
content
is
hardly
noticed
but
watch
out
cuz
it
will
sneak
up
behind
ya
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
falls
to
nothing
fairly
quickly

is
kind
of

im
amazed
its
a

and
this
was
bottled
on

2
months

amazing
i
got
this
as
single
for
3
49
in
downtown
princeton
nj
where
things
are
overpriced
to
begin
with
a
real
bargain
im
surprised
dfh
doesnt
put
the
exclamation

on
this
one

a

with

from

the

intense

complex
i
get

caramel

alcohol
and
more
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thick
at
first
the
flavor
strikes
me
as
fruity
hints
of
vanilla

licorice
wood
caramel
and
alcohol
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
but
its
there
and
i
can
feel
the
warming
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
bigger
beers
d
very
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
am
surprised
that
they
labeled
this
as
a
malt
beverage
it
is
a
pleasant
youd
never
think
this
was
a
brown
ale
there
is
some
brown
in
the
appearance
but
only
as
dark
brown
highlights
looks
more
like
a
double
stou
of
sorts
good
dark
brown
head
after
the
pour
but
it
quickly
recedes
the
aroma
is
a
striking
banana
vanilla
marshmellow
with
wood
undertones
mix
wow
thetaste
starts
with
brownies
mixed
with
marshmellows
and
rice
krispie
treats
the
some
hops
mix
wth
a
little
coffee
and
bananas
with
a
big
dollop
of
vanilla
cream
wit
some
very
exotic
woody
undertones
the
palate
is
a
complex
yet
silky
smooth
with
a
well
integrated
and
balanced
alcohol
content
the
kind
of
sipping
beer
you
sip
and
think
to
yourself
what
and
awesomely
unique
beer
d
easy
to
drink
i
have
to
try
and
drink
it
slow
as
the
high
abv
can
come
back
and
get
ya
really
a
great
beer
and
has
to
be
my
favorite
dfh
brew
thus
far
went
down
way
too
quick
for
that
abv
though
whew
overall
a
nice
new
entry
from
dogfish
head
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
it
often
even
if
it
was
available
here
in
texas
this
was
my
only
bottle
but
im
interested
to
read
reviews
of
this
with
some
age
on
it
i
feel
like
im
reviewing
two
different
beers
given
my
impression
of
this
fresh
im
only
willing
to
raise
my
marks
to
average
a
definite
candidate
for
cellaring
way
way
too
hot
for
the
moment
imo
it
poured
brownblack
murky
with
a
tan
head
good
lacing
smell
is
woody
and
caramelly
taste
is
roasty
bitter
and
brown
also
some
moderate
alcohol
presence
but
i
had
no
idea
it
was
12
when
i
had
it
the
body
was
both
good
and
bad
so
i
gave
it
a
3
the
body
was
real
thick
and
oily
but
it
was
very
smooth
and
consistent
drinkable
as
a
nice
sipping
drink
for
sure
but
not
any
faster
than
45
minutes
for
the
8
oz
pour
that
i
had
its
a
good
beer
and
while
perhaps
unique
in
creation
this
is
not
so
offcentered
tasting
that
said
i
enjoyed
it
make
no
mistake
and
i
hope
to
see
similarly
creative
projects
from
them
in
the
future
d
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
love
dogfish
and
this
is
yet
another
great
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
dogfish
always
redefines
my
definition
of
what
a
style
could
possibly
be
and
they
have
acoomplished
again
a
brown
ale
could
be
anything
from
a
samuel
smith
brown
to
this
sam
calagione
never
fails
to
do
something
different
id
say
try
it
im
glad
i
did
a
single
i
wont
be
buying
a
4
pack
too
pricey
a
beautiful
dark
beer
with
a
really
deep
tan
head
that
fades
to
lace
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
a
really
complex
mix
of
malt
and
wood
the
vanilla
is
quite
aparent
but
theres
a
lot
more
going
on
there
as
with
the
smell
the
taste
doesnt
dissapoint
malty
malty
wood
i
like
it
a
lot
the
chocolate
malt
provides
a
bit
of
dryness
in
the
mouthfeel
thats
really
nice
in
a
beer
that
has
a
potential
to
be
overwhelmingly
sweet
once
again
i
dont
think
i
would
have
a
problem
drinking
my
limit
of
this
beer
which
would
probably
be
about
three
d
interesting
beer
here
that
i
am
enjoying
being
able
to
try
but
i
dont
think
this
flavor
profile
is
really
my
favorite
out
there
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
any
time
soon
but
it
was
fun
to
try
as
it
definitely
is
an
offcentered
ale
complaints
hmm
as
noted
this
is
more
of
a
one
sitting
beer
youre
there
to
respect
it
and
pick
apart
its
offerings
its
a
bit
tart
if
were
getting
picky
wellcrafted
without
a
doubt
its
an
unreplicated
offering
and
as
such
has
added
to
the
beer
world
mahagony
coloring
tastes
kind
of
nutty
but
sweet
also
smoky
very
complicated
also
has
a
bit
of
a
berry
taste
initially
also
has
a
very
malty
taste
to
it
has
a
banana
tasting
finish
to
it
for
such
a
high
abv
it
makses
the
alcohol
well
feels
sudsy
on
the
tongue
as
strong
as
this
beer
is
it
is
really
really
drinkable
poured
opaque
black
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
lattecolored
head
that
rose
and
frothed
with
the
pour
but
soon
dissipated
smell
is
dark
roast
coffee
and
wood
with
some
sharp
alcohol
should
mellow
out
with
aging
taste
is
marvelously
complex
vanillas
and
caramels
out
front
with
good
bitter
roastiness
and
slight
alcohol
burn
this
is
like
the
dogfish
indian
brown
ale
gone
to
college
it
lost
some
of
that
hoppiness
and
gained
a
whole
lot
more
depth
mouthfeel
is
great
silky
smooth
and
full
none
of
the
thinness
that
similarly
alcoholic
beers
have
drinkability
suffers
from
the
12
though
but
one
of
these
after
a
barbeque
dinner
while
everyone
is
sitting
around
swatting
bugs
as
the
sun
goes
down
sounds
alright
to
me
overall
this
is
one
complex
beer
with
many
different
flavors
coming
together
for
an
incredible
experience
d
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
for
sampling
this
i
dont
typically
drink
a
lot
of
beers
in
the
10
range
unless
im
over
at
my
friends
house
but
this
one
is
definitely
one
i
could
enjoy
as
an
after
dinner
drink
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
had
from
dfh
this
is
tied
with
the
rochy
10
and
the
westy
12
as
my
favorite
beer
ever
an
absolutely
timeless
creation
by
the
always
forward
thinking
dogfish
head
brewery
dark
brown
almost
black
out
of
the
bottle
not
unlike
coffee
looked
thick
when
pouring
but
wasnt
really
thick
to
drink
had
a
cream
colored
head
about
1
cm
high
smelled
like
coffee
and
cedar
chips
tastes
of
coffee
again
molasses
prune
juice
and
cognac
were
detected
i
also
thought
i
tasted
a
hint
of
soy
sauce
the
light
kind
very
creamy
texture
and
smooth
going
down
the
carbonation
seemed
to
be
just
right
and
lasted
the
whole
glass
not
much
in
terms
of
a
wood
taste
but
it
seemed
to
have
a
woody
dryness
to
it
that
coincided
with
a
little
bitterness
the
alcohol
was
detectable
but
just
right
i
shared
a
sip
with
some
japanese
friends
who
described
it
as
tasting
like
boiled
konbu
which
is
a
thick
darkgreen
seaweed
used
for
making
soup
bases
and
sauces
this
is
definitely
a
sipping
beer
that
i
think
would
be
nice
on
a
chilly
night
beside
an
open
fire
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
14
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
a
warm
crystal
and
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
nice
vanilla
aroma
laid
over
a
mild
woodiness
the
taste
is
just
as
good
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
is
rich
and
complex
its
dry
and
roasted
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
a
sweet
crystal
malt
finish
the
wood
mellows
the
12
abv
and
adds
another
layer
of
compleity
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
one
tastey
beer
im
glad
dogfish
is
back
making
extreme
beers
rewarding
beer
i
imagine
it
would

just
shy
of
being
dry
carbonation

it
is
really
an
extreme
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
dfh
has
in

next
i
would
like
to
see
some
more

i
dont
really
get
what
everybody
sees
in
this
one
along
with

well
remeinds
me
more
of
a
stout
than
anything
else

a
lot
of
love
went
into
this
beer
even
though
i
thought
the
dvd
was
great
and
enhanced
my
whole
experience
not
to
mention
dfh
gets
an
additional
thumbs
up
for
using
the
books
for
the
open
and
close
tune
limited
lacing
and
wood
taste
is
equally
rich
and
complex
very
smooth
velvety
mouth
feel
almost
like
a
combination
of
a
quad
and
a
ris
hiodes
the
alcohol
very
well
finish
lacks
bitterness
thats
about
the
only
complaing
i
have
about

very
enjoyable
the
12
is
quite
well
hidden
within
this
fine
beer
the
palo
santo
wood
really
brings
a
little
some
extra
to
the
beer
with
a
butterscotchcolored
head
the
wood
aromas
leap
out
of
the
glass
initial
taste
impressions
are
suggestions
of
caramel
licorice
d
this
beer
gets
big
points
on
creativity
but
it
if
wasnt
for
all
the
hype
and
dvd
i
would
have
assumed
it
was
just
a
brown
ale
with
a
bit
of
an
off
flavor
it
is
still
a
nice
sipping
brown
ale
but
i
dont
think
it
was
worth
the
deforestation
of
a
region
in
south
america
im
only
kidding
but
it
did
cross
my
mind
poured
into
a
snifter

vanilla
and
caramel
tastes
up
front
not
quite
the
flavor
i
expected
from
a
brown
ale
which
sets
this
one
from
the
rest
it
almost
starts
like
an
oak
aged
imperial
stout
some
bourbon
as
well
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
great
carbonation
level
very
complex
palate
extremely
smooth
for
12
very
nice
drinkability
and
its
a
sleeper
absolute
greatness
which
is
expected
when
drinking
dfh
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
but
not
what
you
would
expect
for
a
12
beer
the
wood
used
here
gives
it
a
nice
flavor
good
effect
medium
body
with
a
fair
enough
amount
of
carbonation
very
nice
this
is
a
great
beer
good
job
by
the
guys
at
dfh
i
might
have
to
get
more
of
this
mediumfull
in
body
thinner
than
expected
but
in
a
good
way
incredibly
smooth
and
creamy
but
not
thick
syrupy
or
cloying
awesome
beer
a
sipper
that
drinks
way
too
easily
excellent
try
if
you
can

poured
a
blackish
brown
color
it
looks
black
but
when
pouring
the
stream
from
the
bottle
to
glass
was
more
on
the
brown
color
with
a
mocha
colored
head
smell
is
mixture
of
the
malt
carmel
yeast
and
the
wood

taste
is

carmel
dark

mouthfeel
is
great
with
a
fullbody
syrup
mouthfeel
without
being
to

this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
for
12
with
great
full
flavor
great
job
dogfish
head
d
wow
am
i
glad
i
bought
2
packs
of
this
definitely
a
beer
i
will
enjoy
over
the
coming
months
and
one
id
like
to
cellar
i
dont
actually
have
a
cellar
for
next
winter
seriously
this
is
excellent
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
it
watch
the
dvd
and
enjoy
one
of
these
one
of
the
best
dfh
ive
had
in
a
long
time
for
sure
great
work
dfh
totally
worth
the
price
drinkability
is
surprisingly
very
good
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
and
interesting
beer
that
is
actually
very
easy
to
sip
certainly
a
beer
that
is
worth
trying
poured
a
very
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
mocha
head
that
left
an
even
thinner
ring
and
some
spotted
lacing
smells
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
sweet
malts
and
a
little
vanilla
tasted
of
coffee
with
some
earthy
wood
tones
and
a
slight
bitterness
and
tart
bite
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thick
but
flowed
down
silky
and
smooth
overall
this
one
is
something
to
come
back
to
on
a
regular
basis
and
i
wouldnt
mind
putting
some
down
to
see
how
they
age
d
very
interesting
the
woody
flavor
becomes
more
prominent
as
it
warms
drinkability
this
stuff
is
great
very
rich
in
flavor
definately
not
a
session
brew
but
i
could
sip
my
way
through
a
few
on
a
relaxing
evening
with
good
friends
i
highly
recommend
this
one
drink
it
now
and
lay
one
down
for
a
couple
years
i
also
like
the
idea
of
releasing
a
dvd
with
the
beer
havent
had
a
chance
to
watch
it
yet
but
its
a
great
idea
and
will
hopefully
provide
some
insight
into
the
idea
behind
the
beer
and
working
with
the
wood
fermentors
definitely
worth
tracking
down
i
know
they
have
a
few
at
the
local
andersons
store
in
lima
pours
an
inviting
dark
black
color
with
a
deep
brown
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
aroma
of
coffee
chocolate
and
nuts
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
some
woody
notes
and
dark
fruits
fullbodied
and
smooth
goes
down
well
a
bit
of
tingle
from
the
invisible
carbonation
no
noticeable
alcohol
in
the
taste
or
aroma
which
is
a
big
plus
this
was
a
real
joy
to
drink
highly
recommended
everything
about
this
one
is
unique
the
wood
gives
sweet
characteristics
that
complement
the
roastiness
of
the
malts
well
in
the
nose
as
well
as
the
taste
this
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
a
great
beer
but
i
probably
wont
drink
it
that
often
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
4
pack
good
stuff
here
wish
i
could
afford
to
drink
a
case
of
these
and
wish
i
could
handle
more
than
two
because
of
the
abv
a
very
interesting
brew
for
sure
would
like
to
age
a
couple
and
see
what
happens
overall
sweet
creamy
and
smooth
i
could
drink
several
of
these
d
this
beer
seems
very
complex
and
full
of
flavors
none
of
which
i
really
liked
its
quite
different
from
any
other
beer
ive
had
not
sure
id
drink
it
again
for
anyone
who
lkes
a
very
earthy
beer
with
a
prevalent
woody
character
you
may
love
it
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
if
you
have
the
means
i
highly
recommend
one
ferris
bueller
deep
very
dark
bown
in
color
somewhat
foamy
head
woody
sweet
smelling
aroma
strong
malty
flavor
with
a
deep
and
earthy
flavor
to
it
there
is
a
slight
spicey
flavor
i
cannot
pinpoint
but
i
have
tasted
it
before
the
lingering
sweetnesswoody
flavor
is
great
no
visible
trace
of
any
alcohol
very
full
and
smooth
body
simply
an
amazing
beer
i
was
so
impressed
when
i
first
had
this
at
the
brewpub
when
it
was
a
one
off
to
me
the
best
beer
dfh
has
doneperiod
got
mine
at
the
firehouse
liquors
that
dude
has
some
good
ones
and
he
is
selling
4
packs
for
16
99
and
singles
for
4
95
i
bought
two
so
i
could
try
one
and
cellar
one
for
at
least
a
year
to
see
how
they
differ
maybe
longer
supposedly
it
says
you
can
age
this
one
for
up
to
8
years
i
am
not
so
sure
about
that
but
with
the
dark
malts
and
the
12
abv
i
suppose
it
is
possible
and
maybe
worth
a
shot
mouth
feel
is
quite
pleasant
bubbles
are
light
and
body
is
filling
without
being
over
bearing
really
good
finish
id
never
suspect
12
abv
d
reasonably
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
beer
though
the
flavors
are
quite
heavy
and
i
certainly
do
not
feel
like
opening
another
bottle
tonight
it
is
quite
complex
and
well
worth
trying
one
of
dogfish
heads
more
successful
experiments
eric
md
full
bodied
carbonation
is
about
medium
on
the
tongue
slightly
creamy
and
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
except
for
slight
warming
drinkability
is
good
alcohol
is
concealed
well
overall
a
good
beer
not
blown
away
by
it
kind
of
hard
for
me
to
pick
out
in
definite
wood
character
maybe
with
some
cellaring
it
will
come
out
more
pours

and

bourbony
roasty
twang
vanilla
is
soft
and
subtle
but
is
stronger
when
agitated
nice
vanilla
sweetness
rolls
over
the
tongue
in
the
taste
and
mixes
with
the
cola
like
sweetness
a
bourbony
warmth
of
alcohol
comes
on
in
the
finish
and
blends
nicely
with
a
woody
dryness
mouthfeel
is
on
the
full
side
thick
and
malty
slightly
prickly
carbonation
and
a
good
bite
of
alcohol
and
dryness
at
the
back
of
the
throat
in
the
finish
a
very
good
beer
definitely
look
forward
to
a
couple
of
years
on
this
one
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
massive
woody
taste
i
almost
drain
poured
it
but
finished
it
anyway
no
way
i
want
another
one
ill
be
looking
to
trade
the
3
i
have
left
its
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
it
goes
down
smoothly
a
very
interesting
beer
d
obviously
the
wood
aging
is
a
bit
overboard
for
me
how
bout
some
subtlety
i
could
suck
this
one
down
in
minutes
i
am
trying
to
restrain
myself
since
i
have
to
drive
somewhere
after
this
one
beer
i
need
to
seek
out
more
of
these
this
is
my
favorite
dfh
beer
to
date
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
good
creamy
rich
and
thick
mouthfeel
dominate
this
beer
with
a
decent
drinkability
that
only
took
a
slight
hit
due
to
the
very
hefty
12
abv
which
was
very
well
masked
behind
a
rich
conglomeration
of
sweet
unique
flavors
very
good
stuff
another
winner
from
dogfish
definitely
recommended
once
again
dogfish
head
has
created
a
beer
that
wine
lovers
would
turn
their
heads
towards
i
would
love
to
cellar
this
beer
for
a
year
just
to
see
what
happens
i
could
just
sense
that
the
woody
notes
of
the
beer
would
creep
even
closer
to
the
top
jonathan
passow
ive
never
had
a
4pack
to
come
wiht
a
cd
before
i
thought
i
was
getting
a
deal
with
left
hand
6packs
with
the
free
sticker
our
homebrew
club
recently
brewed
an
imperial
brown
and
aged
it
in
a
four
roses
bourbon
barrel
for
the
08
nhc
interesting
to
compare
the
differences
this
beer
surely
qualifies
for
a
double
brown
without
loosing
any
balance
falling
into
porter
or
stout
territory
a
nice
chocolaty
nutty
flavor
with
a
hearty
helping
of
malt
sweetness
and
berrylike
esters
good
hopping
rates
give
the
beer
a
grassy
piney
flavor
while
offsetting
the
heavy
sweetness
the
wood
gives
a
wellroundness
to
the
flavors
but
dont
give
a
whole
lot
of
wood
flavor
or
astringency
quite
delicate
in
its
balance
despite
a
dominant
alcohol
ethanoltaste
and
slightly
harsh
textures
but
does
thin
the
weighted
brew
a
bit
surprised
to
see
a
fizzy
head
formation
that
didnt
last
any
time
at
all
nor
did
the
carbination
strange
for
dfh
the
four
pack
came
with
a
dvd
glued
to
the
side
i
almost
didnt
see
it
d
it
doesnt
get
much
more
drinkable
for
a
12
brew
if
i
had
much
more
id
have
another
but
i
want
to
save
and
savor
these
i
cant
wait
to
age
these
that
sounds
dumb
i
will
get
more
to
drink
now
as
well
last
summer
i
made
a
pilgrimage
ot
rehoboth
beach
i
need
to
find
another
excuse
to
do
that
so
i
can
taste
some
of
this
on
tap
wonderful
d
this
is
a
nice
strong
brown
ale
i
am
not
sure
i
could
have
it
all
the
time
but
it
is
tasty
palo
santo
marron
has
just
been
released
in
bottles
as
well
as
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
in
rehoboth
it
is
served
in
the
8
oz
snifter
and
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
little
amber
quality
the
smell
is
very
earthy
and
very
sweet
with
some
chocolate
notes
and
the
dark
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
very
good
but
unusual
you
can
definitely
taste
the
wood
in
the
beer
it
is
described
as
an
epic
brown
ale
and
it
does
just
that
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
and
a
little
creamy
the
drinkability
hurts
a
little
due
to
the
weight
and
size
of
this
beer
dogfish
keeps
it
coming
with
the
craft
beer
and
i
am
always
blown
away
by
their
creativity
this
one
was
hard
to
find
only
10
cases
came
to
athens
had
this
beer
at
trappeze
pub
the
appearance
was
impressive
for
a
12
abv
it
had
a
decent
size
head
with
some
patchy
lacing
the
nose
had
rich
woodsy
smell
with
dark
fruity
undertones
the
taste
was
really
smooth
for
being
so
high
in
alcoholwhich
gave
the
brew
a
sherry
like
quality
caramelized
apples
and
light
notes
of
sherrywood
and
spice
really
add
to
the
complexity
the
mouthfeel
was
solid
but
not
extremely
silky
for
being
oak
aged
the
drinkabilty
is
great
for
a
night
cap
this
one
will
sneak
up
on
ya
d
get
out
your
finest
glass
serve
slightly
warm
and
call
it
a
nightcap
thats
what
im
doing
right
now
this
beer
is
wonderful
certainly
one
of
the
more
interesting
brews
i
have
ever
been
able
to
sample
the
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
give
way
to
flavors
of
dark
sweet
chocolate
malts
especially
on
the
front
vanilla
light
sweet
dried
fruit
strong
coffee
and
a
mild
smokiness
i
imagine
was
imparted
by
the
palo
santo
barrels
theres
a
heck
of
a
lot
going
on
here
and
the
best
way
to
experience
it
is
through
a
nottoocold
tasting
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
became
even
more
intense
and
the
balance
shifted
slightly
i
wish
it
werent
quite
so
carbonated
but
thats
a
pet
peeve
i
have
with
too
many
ales
to
complain
too
bitterly
which
is
fine
with
me
but
may
make
this
one
harder
to
down
for
some
im
glad
i
scarfed
up
the
last
few
4packs
i
could
find
around
here
in
south
jersey
i
found
a
bonus
on
the
4pack
itself
was
a
dvd
where
the
folks
at
dfh
explain
what
went
ito
the
making
of
this
brew
d
very
good
the
alcohol
presence
was
virtually
nonexistant
making
this
one
quite
drinkable
i
have
to
disagree
in
calling
this
a
brown
ale
first
of
all
the
beer
poured
a
thick
black
color
with
a
thin
dark
head
into
a
12oz
pilsner
glass
the
smell
was
of
caramel
currants
roasted
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
appearance
and
smell
were
more
in
line
with
a
stout
an
imperial
stout
i
guess
due
to
the
12
abv
the
initial
taste
was
of
sweet
caramel
malt
thick
and
viscous
transitioning
into
a
very
fullbodied
toasted
malt
and
alcohol
finish
very
stoutish
very
smooth
and
balanced
for
a
12
abv
brew
possibly
the
smoothest
high
alcohol
beer
ive
ever
had
i
cant
honestly
say
i
could
pick
out
the
contribution
the
palo
santo
wood
made
to
the
beer
but
this
is
a
great
brew
nonetheless
even
if
the
style
categorization
seems
to
be
wrong
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
bodied
and
extremely
smooth
carbonation
is
excellent
it
is
strong
at
12
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
but
its
extremely
drinkable
definitely
not
hard
to
put
away
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
very
unique
i
would
strongly
suggest
picking
it
up
while
you
have
the
chance
this
is
an
intensely
special
beer
and
one
should
take
the
time
to
enjoy
it
like
most
dogfish
head
brews
its
expensive
but
worth
a
try
next
time
i
have
one
it
will
be
at
cellar
temp
i
hope
this
will
bring
out
more
of
the
subtle
flavors
12
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
21108
served
in
a
dogfish
head
snifter
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
a
half
inch
brown
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
ok
the
aroma
is
great
and
very
unique
i
assume
the
stronger
part
of
the
aroma
since
its
something
thats
not
familiar
to
me
is
from
the
palo
santo
wood
i
can
also
smell
some
vanilla
toffee
and
cream
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
just
all
over
the
place
with
each
sip
it
seems
like
i
can
taste
something
different
i
can
taste
wood
chocolate
toffee
vanilla
roasted
malt
molasses
coffee
dark
fruit
and
little
bit
of
booze
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
creamy
coating
and
a
little
bit
slick
drinkability
is
pretty
good
too
its
smooth
and
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
beer
thats
12
abv
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
but
its
very
enjoyable
this
is
one
of
the
better
and
most
unique
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
i
definitely
recommend
this
get
some
if
you
can
music
enjoyed
whilst
sampling
hes
back
by
the
mighty
mighty
bosstones
age
has
softened
and
smoothed
this
beer
bringing
out
the
deep
fragrant
wood
earthy
spicy
and
mildly
tannic
the
base
beer
has
held
up
pretty
well
too
with
just
a
touch
of
oxidation
unfortunately
mildly
papery
some
buckwheat
honey
the
palate
opens
with
caramel
and
cocoa
before
segueing
into
burnt
toffee
buckwheat
honey
earth
and
spice
really
really

this
is
a
good
beer
a
damn
good
beer
in
fact
mouth
coating
with
maybe
the
longest
finish
ive
had
in
a
brew
it
just
sticks
with
you
and
stays
and
stays
and
stays
and
well
you
get
the
picture
very
rich
and
creamy
tastes
nearly
like
it
smells
with
very
litte
in
way
of
the
wood
used
not
sure
how
much
of
the
wood
could
really
infuse
the
beer
anyway
being
a
10000
gallon
barrel
gooey
brown
sugar
with
rummy
raisins
roasted
almost
burnt
malts
date
black
fig
plums
and
nutty
berry
like
middle
a
damn
good
beer
however
this
one
is
so
big
and
rich
it
could
take
quite
awhile
to
drink
one
let
alone
more
with
age
in
the
bottle
i
see
that
changing
d
not
so
drinkable
1
maybe
2
beers
a
sitting
i
drank
it
by
itself
thought
maybe
if
paired
with
food
if
maybe
the
taste
and
drinkability
would
increase
its
pretty
drinkable
and
would
be
far
better
if
it
didnt
have
the
odd
mouthfeel
d
i
sampled
the
first
batch
at
the
rehoboth
beach
brewpub
in
the
fall
of
06
i
remember
tasting
a
lot
of
wood
vanilla
and
booze
it
wasnt
bad
then
but
whatever
changes
they
made
are
a
huge
improvement
i
love
dfh
for
their
willingness
to
experiment
it
doesnt
always
work
but
this
is
certainly
a
success
the
beer
poured
a
brownish
black
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
the
nose
of
the
beer
was
a
soothing
toasted
malty
aroma
there
was
also
a
touch
of
coco
in
the
nose
the
beer
had
a
full
body
and
the
taste
gives
you
more
of
the
strong
malty
backbone
which
is
very
pleasing
with
the
abv
at
about
14
this
is
a
ver
strong
beer
but
mike
did
a
great
job
of
melding
the
taste
profile
with
the
high
abv
it
does
not
at
all
overpower
the
last
although
i
didnt
get
much
of
a
woody
taste
from
the
rare
wood
that
it
was
aged
on
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
beer
and
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
come
across
this
at
a
dfh
event
get
yourself
some
i
had
the
pleasure
of
stopping
into
the
rehoboth
bar
and
finding
this
gem
on
tap
deep
reddish
brown
in
color
and
peppery
to
the
taste
the
gm
was
on
scene
and
showed
me
a
sample
of
the
paolo
santo
wood
that
they
age
the
beer
with
odd
looking
south
american
hardwood
with
a
blue
tint
that
gave
the
beer
the
peppery
taste
i
mentioned
the
taste
was
excellent
and
drinkability
was
good
enough
to
drink
2
or
3
of
them
at
12
abv
you
may
not
want
to
drink
more
than
that
those
small
snifters
pack
a
wallop
limited
edition
beer
not
available
for
carry
out
so
stop
into
the
bar
while
it
lasts
a
little
too
heavy
and
sweet
for
me
perhaps
a
smaller
glass
would
have
been
better
finished
with
a
sharp
alcohol
bite
lost
some
drinkability
due
to
the
bite
but
it
was
still
very
tasty
think
it
would
be
perfect
for
aging
if
bottled
doesnt
seem
like
any
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
overall
this
is
another
different
unique
creation
from
dfh
the
abv
snuck
up
on
me
and
that
made
it
a
3
5
instead
of
a
4
0
you
dont
smell
or
taste
the
alcohol
but
you
feel
it
this
was
a
good
one
so
hurry
up
and
get
some
before
its
gone

maybe
im
just
not

into

every

i
have
this

i
like
it
a

less
super
bubbly
and
large

dark
brown
color
very
malty
very
very
roasty
almost
a
burnt
ashtray
kind
of
finish
has
a
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
it
is
pretty
drinkable
but
not
totally
impressive
absolutely
delicious
drinks
like
soft
chocolate
definitely
good
for
a
round
or
two
very
smooth
and
easy
drinker
not
much
hop
to
this
brown
but
good
malty

flavor
great
mouth
feel
and
never
to
much
carbonation
out
of
the
bottles
keg
of
moose
drool
drank
a
very
decent
brown
ale
i
really
miss
this
stuff
from
my
days
out
in
big
sky
country
a
tasty
english
brown
would
definitely
recommend
it
slight
smokiness
that
really
makes
it
shine
very
weak
pour
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
decently
sweet
malty
aroma
flavor
has
a
respectable
balance
between
toasty
malts
and
hoppy
bitterness
ultra
dark
brown
beer
with
a
nice
tan
head
large
bubbled
the
smell
is
malty
some
roasty
notes
and
no
real
fruit
taste
has
a
melanoid
flavor
lots
of
converted
sugars
and
roasty
flavors
some
malt
bitter
balance
but
the
hops
ar
not
a
real
factor
in
the
taste
full
in
body
mall
idly
good
similar
flavours
sweet
bready
malt
some
light
toasty
characters
o
a
decent
but
not
exceptional
beer
tastes
good
drinks
well
just
not
the
most
robust
or
nuanced
brown
ive
enjoyed
great
taste
right
up
there
with
black
butte
porter
not
too
heavy
good
for
multiple
draws
o
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
not
a
very
complexed
beer
however
i
havent
had
many
good
browns
smooth
brown
ale
the
way
a
brown
ale
should
be
easy
drinking
beer
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
but
a
very
nice
finish
very
disappointed
with
the
smell
did
not
really
engage
the
senses
root

an

intro

to
have
if
you
plan
on

ive
enjoyed
moose

in
several
incarnations
in
several
settings
from
yellowstone
to
whitefish
to
my
basement
this
sampling
is
out
of
a
can
6
for
a
sixer
picked
up
on
our
way
home
from
montana
moose
drool
pours
nicely
a
burst
of
tawny
head
that
gradually
disappears
it
is
a
rich
ruby
color
i
think
i
am
color
blind
after
all
the
nose
is
chocolate
and
caramel
the
taste
full
of
chocolate
and
happiness
this
beer
is
creamy
smooth
and
generally
delicious
i
was
mauled
by
a
moose
but
at
the
last
minute
he
drooled
into
my
mouth
i
was
fine
with
it
from
then
on
this
is
ok
kinda
plain
shiner
bock
is
a
notch
or
two
above
this
too
bad
i
love
big
skys
ipa
winter
beer
wonderful
smooth
homey
underated
beer
was
a
pleasure
to
try
overall
this
is
a
straightforward
and
drinkable
brown
ale
albeit
lacking
in
nuance
and
complexity
im
hardly
a
brown
ale
connoisseur
though
so
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
dark
brown
smells
malty
with
roasted
nut
coffee
taste
maybe
a
little
chocolate
not
as
rich
as
a
stout
though
very
tasty
not
bad
but
not
my
thing
so
good
i
havent
had
this
in
years
but
i
remember
it
being
a
fantastic
experience
16

the

house
in

this
brew
is
very
much
like
a
number
of
english
brews
im
familiar
with
it
seems
pretty
true
to
style
in
that
sense
it
makes
for
a
good
beer
but
certainly
one
of
subtleties

toasted
nutty
malt
with
caramel
and
light
floral
hops
form
the
aroma
theres
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
an
almost
smoky
character
flavor
is
herbal
smoky
nutty
with
a
hint
of
fruity
specialty
malt
character
and
cola
the
finish
is
dry
and
a
touch
bitter
a
fairly
even
heel
brew
without
any
standout
characteristics
the
smoky
notes
are
unexpected
m
pretty
soft
would
say
creamy
except
its
a
little
too
thin
starts
with
a
malty
nose
with
more
lightly
roasted
grains
than
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
pours
brilliant
chestnut
brown
with
a
1
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thick
film
the
palate
starts
between
caramel
and
chocolate
over
light
roasted
nuts
moving
more
to
chocolate
then
a
hint
of
coffee
before
finishing
with
a
lingering
nutty
chocolate
finish
very
creamy
with
very
fine
soft
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
everything
is
very
nicely
balanced
with
out
a
trace
of
harshness
there
are
just
enough
hops
on
the
finish
to
balance
the
malty
sweetness
of
the
beer
t
promise
of
the
nose
seems
underserved
in
taste
which
is
fairly
onenote
and
can
be
summed
up
as
all
nuts
not
chocolatecovered
malt
balls
just
nuts
its
like
they
squeezed
nuts
to
a
max
you
taste
walnut
yadi
yadi
yada
and
you
get
the
earthiness
of
the
shell
and
the
bitterness
of
a
walnut
that
has
been
juiced
some
dark
german
black
bread
quality
adds
to
the
earthiness
and
gives
the
body
some
stability
nary
any
sweetness

would
actually

if
you
cant
tell
already
this
beer
is
making
me
glow
with
enthusiasm
theres
not
much
more
to
say
other
than
if
you
havent
tried
this
glorious
brew
yet
you
need
to
asap
unless
you
hate
black
licorice
or
brown
ales
all
together
then
you
may
not
like
it
send
it
to
me
o
eh
a
decent
brown
ale
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
done
o
good
brown
ale
but
mostly
its
the
name
and
label
i
like
feels
like
some
hunting
or
canoe
trip
beer
reminiscent
of
the
great
outdoors
somewhere
northern
us
or
canada
got
this
one
in
kalamazoo
mi
final
thoughts
all
offflavors
aside
this
is
just
an
okay
beer
at
best
i
brewed
a
clone
of
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
and
even
that
was
better
than
this
is
and
it
takes
a
lot
for
my
homebrews
to
impress
me
not
labeling
a
date
as
either
bottled
on
or
enjoy
by
is
a
cardinal
sin
in
my
book
although
due
to
the
lack
of
malt
flavor
i
suspect
it
wouldnt
make
a
difference
how
fresh
this
beer
is
however
as
always
i
would
give
this
beer
another
chance
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
if
the
head
brewer
handed
me
a
pint
brown
ale
that
is
towards
the
drinkable
side
and
reminds
me
of
english
style
browns
with
the
body
and
toffee
nutty
flavor
overall
very
well
balanced
brown
ale
with
great
malt
flavor
and
interesting
hop
presence
very
drinkable
and
worth
repurchasing
for
sure
also
perfect
when
paired

pretty
good
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
light
brown
head
smells
predominately
of
caramel
chocolate
and
malt
those
follow
to
taste
along
with
a
bit
of
plum
and
raisin
just
a
little
hops
bitterness
medium
light
mouth
with
some
carbonation
a
nice
beer
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
fairly
unremarkable
overall
not
the
greatest
brown
out
there
just
ok
flavor
rich
caramel
dark
chocolate
cocoa
some
hops
in
the
middle
and
finish
leaves
a
lingering
bite
very
dark
in
color
but
not
overwhelmingly
dark
in
taste
little
to
no
head
when
poured
warm
roasted
malt
aroma
strong
barley
flavor
with
very
little
hop
bitterness
very
smooth
as
is
expected
with
a
brown

aftertaste
continues
with
the
roasted

feel
great
afterdinner
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
and
a
frothy
chocolate
head
that

fast
smell
is
malty
chocolate
sweet
and
a
hint
of
smoke
big
malt
flavor
comes
through
and
stays
throughout
the
sip
a
nice
smoky
aftertaste
that
lingers
with
different
sweet
notes
hitting
throughout
a
almost
heavy
mouthfeel
mostly
smooth
lots
of
carbonation
overall
a
nice
beer
almost
stout
like
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
combination
of
flavors
make
this
a
quality
beer
worth
checking
out
very
dark
beer
with
about
a
once
inch
head
when
poured
into
a
glass
this
is
a
great
heavy
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
in
many
places
across
the
united
states
it
doesnt
have
the
typical
dark
beer
taste
that
you
would
expect
the
only
thing
is
that
it
is
hard
to
find
poured
a
nice
rich
brown
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
it
looks
quite
nice
and
inviting
scents
of
bready
malt
caramel
brown
sugar
and
slight
alcohol
a
very
sweet
aroma
for
a
brown
ale
high
in
the
sugary
aromas
but
still
with
a
nice
hit
of
bready
malt
the
alcohol
was
surprising
but
overall
not
a
bad
aroma
profile
flavor
begins
with
caramel
toffee
and
brown
sugar
flavors
that
carry
throughout
in
the
middle
undertones
of
nuttiness
and
toasted
malt
appear
which
are
nice
but
not
as
apparent
as
they
should
be
in
a
brown
ale
the
finish
is
sweet
but
with
a
more
overt
presence
of
the
nutty
and
toasted
flavors
as
well
aftertaste
is
nutty
and
toasted
malt
a
very
sweet
flavor
profile
for
a
brown
ale
quite
malty
but
not
as
bready
nutty
and
toasty
as
i
like
still
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
stick
with
moderate
carbonation
its
a
good
feel
that
compliments
the
malty
nature
of
the
flavor
profile
quite
well
pretty
good
overall
this
is
a
good
american
brown
ale
its
got
a
nice
bready
malty
nose
and
a
sweet
malty
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
that
works
in
the
flavors
favor
i
just
wish
there
was
a
touch
more
toasted
malt
and
nutlike
flavors
but
otherwise
its
a
solid
brown
delightfully
malty
and
delicious
have
enjoyed
it
on
tap
and
from
the
can
of
course
the
tap
is
better
but
the
can
is
available
in
my
home
clean
and
crisp
tasting
pours
nicely
into
glass
serves
well
enjoy
saying
that
i
am
drinking
moose
drool
but
more
importantly
i
enjoy
the
taste
chocolate
and
nuts
in
the
flavor
are
really
good
the
mouth
is
a
little
thin
but
not
as
badly
as
some
failed
brown
ales
this
was
a
refreshing
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
definitely
grab
in
the
future
definitely
close
to
a
brown
ale
but
could
almost
be
something
else
while
the
color
is
very
dark
it
has
some
amber
hues
to
it
very
malty
yet
still
noticeably
hoppy
the
chocolate
and
malty
notes
are
very
obvious
but
seem
to
be
distracted
by
the
willamette
hops
which
cause
a
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
the
smell
is
very
malty
but
again
dispersed
by
the
hops
which
are
not
expected
by
a
brown
ale
pretty
good
brown
ale
the
chocolate
and
nuts
keep
coming
back
sweet
and
a
hop
bitter
finish
overall
a
little
watery
but
considering
this
could
be
a
session
beer
thats
ok
good
not
great
ill
drink
again
hopefully
someone
else
will
be
buying
httpyoutu
beoz0hssyly70
its
an
outstanding
beer
very
delicious
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
much
better
brown
ales
watered
down
and
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
how
great
of
a
nose
this
beer
has
this
ale
is
a
beautiful
dark
caramel
brown
but
the
head
doesnt
last
very
long
after
pouring
and
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
creamier
the
taste
is
lovely
light
on
the
hops
and
spices
but
a
robust
ale
flavor
the
smell
suffers
as
it
lacks
hops
and
spices
to
be
very
aromatic
but
if
one
suffers
over
another
the
taste
better
be
there
for
me
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
hearty
and
leaves
a
crispness
on
the
tongue
not
at
all
bitter
to
my
tastebuds
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
with
about
a
1finger
beige
head
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
perfect
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
dark
malts
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
cocoa
the
taste
is
actually
even
better
than
the
aroma
which
was
a
nutty
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
very
pleasant
and
goes
down
easy
no
bitter
finish
for
this
one
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
o
fantastic
brown
ale
its
nicely
balanced
and
has
some
bitterness
that
adds
to
the
flavor
along
with
the
sweet
characteristics
that
the
beer
has
a
little
filling
but
great
nonetheless
pours
out
really
dark
brownblack
in
the
light
has
a
nice
twofinger
beige
head
with
good
retention
and
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
lots
of
malty
sweetness
with
caramel
dark
malts
from
the
nose
with
really
no
hop
presence
that
i
can
find
in
the
nose
this
smells
quite
unbalanced
but
not
bad
taste
is
fairly
sweet
and
i
can
get
everything
i
could
smell
from
the
nose
but
there
is
really
no
hop
presence
that
i
find
at
all
to
balance
anything
out
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
the
style
imho
mouthfeel
is
decently
thick
for
the
style
or
even
more
so
than
i
expected
but
i
like
a
thicker
beer
overall
this
beer
just
seems
really
unbalanced
for
the
style
its
possible
this
is
an
older
bottle
and
the
hops
have
faded
but
no
date
means
no
way
to
tell
brewers
date
your
beers
please
just
not
the
greatest
beer
for
the
money
overall
an
easy
to
drink
smooth
well
balanced
brown
ale
nothing
mindblowing
but
seems
true
to
style
and
well
done
a
sentimental
favorite
its
one
of
the
first
micros
i
had
and
enjoyed
over
10
years
ago
give
it
a
shot
if
you
like
the
style
o
not
bad
not
good
just
a
shade
below
or
at
average
i
would
say
worth
the
try
overall
fairly
tasty
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
not
terrible
either
overall
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
overall
moose
drool
is
a
very
very
enjoyable
brown
ale
and
one
that
ill
certainly
be
on
the
lookout
for
again
ohaving
attended
college
in
missoula
more
than
ten
years
ago
i
have
had
the
good
fortune
of
drinking
many
moose
drool
but
this
review
was
first
drool
in
a
year
or
two
i
know
my
palate
has
changed
since
college
but
i
recall
the
brew
being
heavier
and
more
flavorful
than
it
was
this
evening
i
could
have
used
a
little
more
malt
body
and
some
hops
to
add
character
pretty
entrylevel
stuff
here
a
simple
but
thoroughly
enjoyable
brown
ale
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
session
from
my
tasting
notes
it
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
that
looked
like
a
cola
the
initial
taste
was
a
big
malty
chocolate
flavor
with
a
full
mouthfeel
that
was
truly
satisfying
as
it
warmed
it
had
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
end
that
kept
it
from
becoming
too
sweet
but
the
malty
chocolatiness
kept
coming
through
the
moose
drool
was
a
wonderful
brown
ale
i
will
gladly
drink
again
o
i
had
seen
this
around
but
had
avoided
buying
it
because
of
the
name
im
very
glad
i
tried
this
a
good
sweet
brown
ale
with
a
surprising
amount
of
complexity
while
still
being
easy
drinking
i
am
all
for
people
having
their
own
likes
and
tastes
but
this
stuff
is
disgusting
seriously
look
at
the
name
very
bitter
chemical
like
taste
i
know
some
will
call
it
deep
complex
rich
flavors
but
it
is
really
gross
i
would
sooner
have
a
pint
of
just
about
anything
except
old
rasputin
then
moose
drool
again
it
is
what
the
name
implies
o
nice
malt
forward
brown
ale
with
light
hop
presence
nutty
and
flavorful
o
this
was
probably
the
first
craft
beer
i
tried
that
turned
me
onto
craft
beer
exclusivly
a
flavorful
malt
forward
brown
ale
that
doesnt
get
boring
and
can
be
drank
in
quantity
cheers
some
reviewers
will
take
off
points
because
this
beer
has
little
unique
qualities
to
make
it
stand
out
in
my
beer
book
unique
experience
is
not
the
trump
card
a
drink
that
makes
me
smile
and
say
this
is
what
beer
is
supposed
to
be
wins
the
game
every
day
o
meh
there
just
isnt
anything
memorable
about
it
o
good
but
different
from
what
id
expected
thats
on
me
though
not
the
brew
its
an
american
not
an
english
brown
ale
and
this
style
is
very
new
to
me
it
has
some
stoutlike
notes
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
which
isnt
good
or
bad
just
what
it
is
overall
hits
most
of
the
notes
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
i
liked
it
good
roasted
malt
taste
coming
from
this
brown
ale
big
nutty
and
herbal
notes
up
front
followed
by
a
slightly
chewy
malt
middle
finishes
semi
dry
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
this
a
solid
brown
ale
with
big
flavors
to
keep
you
coming
back
odecent
brown
ale
easy
drinking
really
nicely
done
the
beer
comes
up
against
the
malt
being
almost
too
sweet
but
doesnt
go
over
the
edge
as
the
bitterness
holds
everything
in
balance
easy
to
pick
this
one
up
for
another
sip
o
great
taste
but
lighter
than
expected
overall
one
of
my
favorite
browns
sweet
without
being
cloying
and
very
refreshing
great
example
of
the
style
tasty
and
well
made
rich
and
creamy
chocolate
coffee
caramel
and
orange
peel
well
balanced
all
over
it
the
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
with
some
mild
carbonation
goes
down
easily
and
satisfyingly
completed
by
the
funny
name
and
label
delicious
its
a
keeper
for
me
the
verdict
good
stuff
brown
ales
arent
my
favorite
style
but
theres
not
much
to
complain
about
in
this
montana
beer
with
the
very
creative
name
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
goes
down
smooth
d
brown
ales
are
not
my
favorite
but
this
one
is
pretty
well
made
o
excellent
brown
ale
body
was
fine
for
the
flavours
and
alcohol
level
i
enjoyed
it
even
in
a
plastic
cup
overall
a
tasty
and
well
crafted
brown
ale
like
best
on
tap
smooth
and
strong
taste
not
many
brown
ales
with
this
distinct
taste
great
during
the
winter
watching
hockey
great
aftertaste
i
would
like
more
bite
to
it
but
usually
brown
ales
dont
so
still
never
disappointed
with
this
brewski
rjt
o
turns
out
this
isnt
just
a
beer
with
a
ridiculous
name
its
a
balanced
wellmade
brown
ale
with
a
ridiculous
name
in
fact
its
one
of
the
most
traditional
american
browns
ive
come
across
with
a
grainy
nofrills
taste
and
a
mouthfeel
thats
just
creamy
enough
i
cant
believe
how
surprised
i
am
at
how
much
i
like
this
beeri
guess
either
the
sortof
gimmicky
label
or
its
wide
availability
gave
me
the
impression
that
it
wouldnt
that
good
no
hard
feelings
big
sky
im
impressed
o
was
very
unfamiliar
with
big
sky
brewing
before
this
so
this
was
a
good
find
for
me
excited
to
try
some
more
of
their
stuff
on
tap
at
selmas
chicago
pizza
deep
mahogoney
almost
black
creamy
head
that
stands
up
well
after
the
first
few
pulls
and
laces
nicely
down
the
glass
ibu
of
30
is
goldilocks
for
me
not
too
bitter
but
has
enough
to
make
it
interesting
and
stand
io
tl
food
really
good
session
beer
overall
this
promised
more
than
it
delivers
i
like
the
aroma
and
i
like
how
it
looks
but
when
it
comes
down
to
it
its
a
little
bit
distracted
and
rather
pedestrian
it
would
be
fine
to
drink
without
thinking
about
it
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
up
on
its
own
under
scrutiny
ive
been
drinking
this
for
a
long
time
and
had
to
get
past
the
name
because
i
honestly
dont
find
it
all
that
appealing
or
evocative
good
thing
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
for
the
style
and
is
also
pretty
cheap
hop
heads
wont
like
it
but
i
think
the
underplayed
hop
profile
fits
the
style
better
its
just
as
good
on
tap
this
beer
is
a
great
goto
beer
flavorful
enough
for
the
darkerroasty
beer
fan
but
not
too
strong
for
the
lighter
beer
drinker
this
is
simply
a
perfect
beer
kudos
to
big
sky
brewing
company
o
this
is
a
real
solid
brown
ale
overall
i
like
how
big
sky
choose
to
name
their
brown
ale
moose
drool
call
me
a
sucker
but
i
find
the
naming
convention
an
example
of
simple
creativity
the
beer
itself
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
enough
flavor
to
be
enjoyed
yet
light
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
at
a
time
while
it
looks
great
and
it
is
well
balanced
it
could
use
some
more
oomph
body
definately
wont
be
buying
anymore
of
this
o
great
overall
balanced
brown
and
the
alcohol
is
more
present
than
i
remember
from
the
last
time
i
enjoyed
this
ale
cheers
o
darn
good
regional
beer
maybe
a
bit
biased
since
its
in
one
of
my
favorite
styles
o
brown
ales
are
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
a
very
well
done
and
enjoyable
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
the
moose
drool
brown
ale
is
an
indispensable
safety
item
and
can
be
found
at
most
grocery
stores
it
can
be
identified
by
its
dark
and
deep
ruby
color
that
has
a
steadfast
foam
head
the
smell
gentle
reminiscent
of
young
barley
on
a
springs
morning
the
brew
tastes
much
better
than
drool
in
reality
with
subtle
coffee
hoppy
and
barley
flavors
that
balance
the
palate
nicely
i
definite
must
for
moose
huntin
o
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
for
sure
give
this
one
a
shot
if
you
have
not
overall
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
quite
tasty
overall
drinkability
a
tasty
beer
that
could
use
a
bit
more
balance
and
body
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
coded
bottle
date
this
pour
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
large
tan
head
which
has
okay
retention
and
doesnt
leave
a
lacing
the
smells
are
of
a
little
nutty
toffee
caramel
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
okay
a
little
caramel
and
toffee
and
perhaps
coffee
but
something
is
missing
overall
i
thought
i
remember
this
beer
being
much
bigger
it
has
good
flavor
but
no
sustain
i
would
have
more
of
these
because
they
are
so
light
it
could
be
my
new
brown
ale
session
beer
if
i
was
looking
for
one
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
brown
ale
my
absolute
favorite
aba
the
clarity
is
absolutely
impressive
with
a
deep
amber
reds
and
browns
copper
when
held
to
the
light
the
aroma
is
of
raisins
dark
toasty
malts
some
baking
chocolate
taste
is
complex
and
appealing
sweet
coffee
unsweetened
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
no
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thin
side
of
medium
carbonation
is
light
more
so
than
a
newcastle
but
only
slightly
one
of
the
best
abas
around
typical
brown
ale
im
not
a
fan
of
brown
ale
otherwise
this
would
be
an
above
average
beer
taste
has
depth
to
it
with
a
caramel
taste
and
a
chocolate
malt
finish
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
had
would
not
stock
my
fridge
with
it
because
of
my
own
taste
in
beers
but
good
to
have
some
around
for
company
that
does
overall
gotta
love
the
moosie
this
is
the
beer
that
started
me
on
crafts
best
enjoyed
around
the
campfire
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
buy
it
again
overall
i
liked
the
slight
nutty
character
and
roasted
coffee
character
in
the
beer
the
most
i
didnt
have
any
problems
with
the
beer
did
not
get
much
aroma
very
roasted
as
it
was
a
pretty
sweet
beverage
was
expecting
more
of
a
nutty
or
coffe
flavor
taste
but
got
more
of
a
soda
pop
feel
to
it
but
overall
nothing
i
can
complain
too
much
about
still
trying
and
learning
more
and
more
about
beers
but
it
was
a
solid
test
o
its
a
nice
drinkable
brew
to
say
the
least
i
thoroughly
enjoy
brews
with
more
complexity
but
overall
this
one
is
acceptable
o
i
love
this
beer
not
only
for
its
flavor
and
overall
characteristics
but
also
for
the
memories
it
conjures
i
prefer
it
from
the
can
and
out
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
as
opposed
to
in
from
a
bottle
on
a
random
saturday
night
i
saw
someone
compare
it
to
newcastle
but
in
my
opinion
they
arent
even
close
this
would
make
a
great
dessert
beer
overall
pretty
good
beer
not
the
best
but
definitely
worth
trying
simple
solid
and
good
thanks
to
flax
for
this
one
o
pleasantly
surprised
grabbed
this
to
complete
my
6
pack
variety
pack
and
would
get
it
again
very
drinkable
a
solid
take
on
a
brown
ale
about
what
id
expect
from
a
porter
but
it
didnt
wow
me
pours
a
dark
brown
in
the
glass
but
still
somewhat
opaque
not
the
biggest
head
but
some
remnants
will
linger
smell
is
average
smell
is
malty
but
not
really
distinct
taste
is
very
good
body
yet
still
light
at
the
same
time
vanilla
and
chocolate
notes
a
beer
ive
looked
forward
to
tracking
down
again
after
first
trying
a
few
years
ago
o
pretty
good
beer
a
solid
brown
ale
gaining
popularity
and
for
good
reason
newcastle
is
the
standard
brown
ale
in
most
american
bars
i
can
only
imagine
its
presence
in
england
but
ive
started
to
see
moose
drool
at
least
offered
as
a
second
option
at
larger
bars
or
replace
newcastle
altogether
its
a
much
better
beer
medium
body
thats
almost
creamy
and
a
nice
nutty
profile
to
it
make
it
a
much
richer
option
for
the
same
price
its
not
a
mindblowing
brown
but
its
good
not
quite
sure
why
ive
passed
on
trying
this
beer
up
to
this
point
this
one
has
a
nice
nutty
tone
to
it
the
body
is
a
bit
thick
so
there
isnt
a
lot
of
room
to
deliver
flavor
character
its
consistent
though
and
i
can
dig
it
wont
be
a
particularly
memorable
brew
though
o
a
highly
drinkable
brown
ale
and
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
ever
had
the
flavors
are
strong
and
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
very
dark
brown
colour
with
nice
lace
smells
with
ginger
cloves
and
molasses
the
smell
seemed
to
blossom
as
it
warmed
in
the
glass
very
enjoyable
taste
is
rich
toasty
malts
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
warmth
to
it
and
a
smooth
finish
it
is
a
medium
mouth
feel
which
is
perfect
for
this
style
overall
its
a
very
enjoyable
flavourful
beer
like
i
said
we
couldnt
get
this
beer
in
indiana
and
it
is
readily
available
here
in
arizona
good
thing
because
this
is
is
a
tasty
beer
i
have
been
getting
into
darker
more
malty
beers
lately
i
still
prefer
an
ipa
but
nothing
beats
a
dark
chocolaty
malty
brew
the
label
might
not
be
very
appetizing
but
the
beer
sure
is
bottoms
up
o
definitely
a
solid
brown
ale
if
you
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
you
should
give
this
a
try
glad
to
recommend
pours
a
clear
super
dark
crimson
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
vanilla
bean
and
some
nutty
aromas
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
toasted
nuts
and
vanilla
bean
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
but
its
a
bit
thin
body
wise
overall
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
with
some
nice
flavors
but
i
just
wish
the
body
was
beefed
up
a
bit
overall
this
is
an
amazingly
good
dark
brown
ale
o
not
an
outstanding
brown
ale
but
a
solid
offering
worthy
of
a
regular
pint
at
the
pub
or
a
6
pack
now
and
again
12oz
bottle
pours
an
almost
black
dark
brown
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
chocolatey
and
earthy
taste
is
alot
like
the
smell
chocolate
and
earthiness
with
maybe
hints
of
citrus
hops
caramel
orange
maybe
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
considering
the
style
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
its
to
be
expected
hints
of
coffee
at
the
end
this
would
be
a
great
autumn
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
had
highly
recommended
very
sessionable
smooth
milky
and
delicious
rate
beer
to
style
people
this
is
a
top
notch
brown
overall
for
an
american
brown
ale
this
is
slightly
above
average
this
would
be
good
on
a
nice
fall
night
as
the
beer
opened
up
the
citrus
flavor
definitely
made
itself
known
which
made
the
beer
above
average
for
me
enjoyable
enough
the
brown
ale
doesnt
do
anything
to
provide
a
thumbprint
or
signature
than
makes
it
distinguishable
from
a
lot
of
other
well
made
but
timid
brown
ales
unfortunately
is
kinda
forgettable
o
very
solid
mass
produced
brown
ale
big
sky
has
the
recipe
down
and
they
shouldnt
change
it
could
drink
a
few
in
one
sitting
overall
its
nice
aba
not
many
can
brew
this
and
give
it
a
balanced
taste
but
moose
drool
is
decent
to
say
the
least
great
session
beer
that
i
could
put
away
all
night
like
everything
ive
had
from
big
sky
this
epitomises
prudent
brewing
nothing
grates
or
feels
overdone
as
far
as
brown
ales
go
this
is
pretty
good
what
it
does
it
does
well
nicely
balanced
ale
that
seems
to
get
it
pretty
right
enjoyable
and
worth
drinking
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
dark
amber
body
is
crystal
clear
and
has
some
mild
carbonation
the
amber
body
is
topped
off
with
a
nice
thick
off
white
head
thats
fluffy
and
creamy
and
sticks
around
for
a
while
i
picked
up
some
hints
of
malts
light
hops
caramel
and
citrus
fruits
its
sharp
when
it
first
hits
your
tongue
but
is
very
smooth
and
slightly
tart
when
it
hits
the
sides
of
your
mouth
i
can
taste
some
orange
zest
mild
hops
and
wheat
along
with
slight
grapefruit
aftertaste
thats
slightly
bitter
theres
some
good
lacing
going
on
too
overall
a
fairly
bland
brown
nothing
offensive
in
the
scent
or
flavor
but
theres
not
a
whole
lot
of
that
to
begin
with
its
smooth
and
drinkable
and
thats
about
it
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
not
filling
but
could
use
a
stronger
taste
and
smell
although
i
picked
this
up
in
yellowstone
last
summer
it
can
actually
be
purchased
at
our
local
grocery
here
in
new
mexico
this
is
an
excellent
brown
ale
all
around
with
enough
hops
to
back
up
the
delicious
chocolate
malt
notes
simple
and
satisfying
this
i
would
certainly
pick
this
up
again
as
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
i
could
easily
see
myself
knocking
a
few
of
these
back
in
a
single
session
this
dark
fellow
really
brings
a
nice
cream
colored
foamy
head
to
the
party
just
a
bit
of
lacing
remains
with
the
fizzy
film
that
cant
hide
a
nearly
opaque
brown
ale
nice
bit
sweet
maltiness
on
the
nose
that
compliments
the
taste
of
sweet
yet
bitter
roasted
malts
the
hop
presence
only
peeks
in
with
the
bitterness
and
perhaps
a
shot
of
earthiness
finish
is
largely
absent
of
much
aftertaste
as
the
only
real
lingering
impression
is
similar
to
toasted
marshmallow
very
easy
drinking
and
uncomplicated
this
is
o
really
good
brown
ale
which
it
was
distributed
around
here
pretty
average
brown
ale
here
pours
a
semitransparent
weak
coffee
color
with
a
minimal
cream
head
smells
like
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
even
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
flavor
is
sweet
and
roasty
but
lacking
much
of
the
complexity
that
i
have
come
to
appreciate
in
this
style
feel
is
a
bit
watered
down
and
the
sweetness
hangs
around
in
the
mouth
long
after
the
swallow
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
sessionable
but
standard
basically
smooth
slightly
sweet
and
insanely
drinkable
o
a
must
try
if
you
like
heavy
beers
you
will
like
this
one
with
a
name
like
moose
drool
whats
not
to
like
d
this
is
a
very
nice
high
quality
american
brown
ale
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
lots
of
good
things
going
on
in
all
facets
highly
sessionable
and
impressively
quaffable
if
i
had
access
to
this
on
a
regular
basis
this
would
be
a
solid
goto
standby
in
my
beer
fridge
on
a
rather
regular
basis
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
rich
enough
in
character
mellow
enough
in
its
drinkability
to
lend
itself
easily
to
knocking
back
several
in
a
sitting
they
have
crazy
sayingsdont
get
caught
chained
up
on
all
fours
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
foam
tastes
great
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
please
come
to
georgia
as
soon
as
possible
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
good
american
brown
ale
it
had
all
the
flavors
that
you
would
expect
from
a
good
brown
ale
and
the
nuttyness
added
some
balance
to
all
those
malts
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
since
the
flavor
held
my
attention
and
it
goes
down
really
smooth
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
flavor
they
were
both
spot
on
for
a
brown
ale
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
prickly
carbonation
and
the
lackluster
head
if
those
were
tweaked
this
would
be
a
great
beer
i
could
see
buying
this
again
when
looking
for
a
good
brown
ale
and
i
would
like
to
try
ordering
this
with
a
meal
if
brown
ales
are
your
thing
then
this
beer
is
for
sure
worth
a
try
this
was
another
good
beer
from
big
sky
they
are
really
showing
me
that
they
are
one
solid
brewery
and
i
am
interested
to
try
more
stuff
from
then
i
wonder
what
some
of
their
bigger
beers
are
like
good
job
guys
this
is
one
proper
american
brown
ale
o
cant
get
this
be
me
and
was
glad
to
seek
it
out
one
of
the
better
browns
you
can
find
at
a
good
craft
bar
o
the
smell
if
a
bit
odd
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
winning
i
look
forward
to
having
one
of
these
again
soon
overall
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
well
easy
to
session
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
theres
nothing
bitter
about
it
and
it
reminds
me
of
a
porter

9
rating
for
me
o
not
my
favorite

but
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
too
overpwoered

a
sweet
and
toasty
nose
of
malts
greets
you
before
notes
of
chocolate
coco
and
light
amounts

noticeable
a
strong
malty

out

followed
by

that
provides
good

hints
of
chocolate
syrup
toffee
nuts
and
a
little
spice
play
together
nicely
in
a
medium
body
with
very
little
carbonation
a
pretty
good
american
attempt
and
an
english
brown
ale
overall
not
my
favorite
beer
ever
but
its
pretty
good
if
you
like
brown
ales
give
it
a
try
not
all
that
enthused
i
guess
but
everyone
has
their
kind
of
thing
they
want
and
enjoy
this
is
a
nice
brew
the
chocolaty
cocoa
flavor
is
nice
and
well
balanced

brown

colour
with
no
head
big
malt
flavours
of
chocolate
and
roasted
grain
with
a
hint
of

spicy
and
herabl
hops
provide
a
balancing
bitterness
and
counterpoint
to
the
malt
but
not
a
lot
of
hops
flavour
finished
drier
than
one
would
expect
a
nice
pint

brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
leaves
very
minor
lacing
light
hop
aroma
with
a
slight
toasted

body
continues
similarly
not
a
bad
beer
and
likely
a
great
eyeopener
for
newbies
just
nothing
great
here
very
drinkable
just
not
a
beer
i
would
reach
for
when
given
other
better
micro
options
ooverall
i
would
recommend
this
brown
ale
over
many
others
including
newcastle
which
isnt
a
bad
beer
either
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
if
brown
ales
are
your
thing
then
this
is
a
good
choice
o
good
stuff
eashy
to
drink
but
complex
enough
to
keep
you
thinking
i
think
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
and
i
wish
i
could
find
it
here
in
pa
maybe
i
can
but
i
have
never
seen
it
thanks
again
to
tballz420
overall
i
think
this
is
a
solid
brown
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
start
out
someone
interested
in
trying
craft
beer
it
is
just
like
a
light
porter
and
this
could
lead
someone
towards
much
bigger
and
greater
brews
note
try
making
a
beer
batter
with
this
beer
it
is
fantastic
food
pairing
sweet
and
salty
candied
nuts
almonds
cashews
pecans
overall
very
smooth
and
pleasant
rather
bold

very
drinkable
back
in
2009
at
a
dark
diner
in
montana
remember
it
a
bit
hopsy
i
dont
have
much
of
a
nose
for
phenol
like
things
it
was
not
thin
it
had
some
substance
adequate

i
was
attracted
to

yes
i
would
try
it
again
i
prefer
dark
beerale
cheers
moose
drool
pours
a
dark
shade
of
brown
thin
head
lingers
its
definitely
similar
to
other
brown
ales
ive
had
good
flavor
not
too
overwhelming
i
would
recommend
this
beer
if
you
like
other
brown
ales
i
would
drink
this
one
again
good
brown
ale
tasty
dr
very
drinkable
for
a
brown
ale
but
it
betrays
the
style
id
try
it
on
draught
but
its
largely
unremarkable
its
decently
priced
for
what
it
is
as
an
import
o
fairly
decent
session
beer
a
beer
that
could
have
a
few
of
the
beer
is
kind
of
light
and
could
use
more
flavor
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
beer
would
be
great
on
a
lazy
summer
evening
or
fall
day
the
body
seems
slightly
light
at
first
but
is
noticeably
heavy
during
the
swallow
the
carbonation
is
only
slightly
fizzy
when
the
beer
is
held
in
the
mouth
but
really
pops
during
the
swallow
this
combination
between
the
body
and
carbonation
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
while
not
adversely
affecting
the
flavor
o
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
beer
with
much
flavor
and
aromas
to
be
enjoyed
over
and
over
again
overall
drinkability
enjoyable
as
a

complex
and
delicious
but
i
felt
those
roasted
notes
came
through
overbearingly
in
the
taste
it
bordered
on
a
burnt
flavor
which
i
found
less
than
ideal
wasnt
too
heavy
so
points
for
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
pretty
solid
brown
ale
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
exciting
but
this
style
rarely
is
moutfeel
was
medium
creamy
with
only
a
little
carbonation
does
not
linger
long
palate
isnt
wrecked
at
all
by
this
one
very
yummy
brown
ale
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
i
like
this
beer
its
simple
enough
to
drink
with
ease
but
the
flavor
profile
is
complex
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
boring
this
is
a
good
beer
for
cool
not
cold
weather
i
can
see
where
this
is
a
cult
beer
in
montana
fits
in
a
lot
of
situations
overall
i
really
love
this
beer
it
is
everything
i
expect
out
of
a
brown
ale
wish
i
could
get
it
in
ohio
overall
its
what
im
looking
for
in
a
brown
ale
aroma
is
nutty
caramel
and
almost
earthy
maple
brown
color
with
thin
dissipating
head
taste
is
extremely
nutty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
as
well
as
malty
maples
palate
is
medium
bodied
slightly
creamy
soft
carbonation
fills
the
mouth
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
browns
12
ounce
can
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
an
inch
and
a
half
tan
head
head
retention
is
decent
and
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
toffee
chocolate
nuts
and
some
caramelbready
malt
the
brew
tastes
like
coffee
chocolate
bready
and
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
nuts
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
velvety
with
good
carbonation
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
not
bad
for
8
99
a
6pack
its
a
solid
overall
brew
out
of
the
five
big
sky
beers
i
purchased
during
my
trip
to
oklahoma
i
saved
this
for
last
after
all
i
only
knew
about
the
brewery
because
of
this
beers
ridiculous
name
unfortunately
some
of
that
creativity
may
have
been
better
utilized
for
the
actual
beer
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
but
i
wont
be
trading
for
it
o
a
nice
above
average
brown
ale
there
are
better
options
around
for
complexity
and
depth
of
flavour
but
id
happily
drink
another
one
of
these
in
the
near
future
and
gotta
love
those
big
sky
brewing
labels
o
o
very
good
brown
ale
and
especially
good
for
cooler
fall
nights
overall
an
awesome
brown
ale
that
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
and
a
smooth
drinking
beer
overall
if
you
like
brown
ale
this
one
is
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
but
it
is
an
improvement
over
something
like
a
newcastle
i
really
wish
i
could
say
more
there
is
a
bit
more
complexity
to
this
but
my
mouth
cant
read
this
brown
ale
worth
anything
o
i
liked
this
beer
you
know
its
nothing
super
special
but
its
like
a
said
relaxing
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brown
definitly
very
drinkable
besides
the
taste
this
beer
is
fine
too
bad
that
taste
is
central
to
a
good
beer
it
was
not
undrinkable
by
any
means
but
it
tasted
like
a
watered
down
brown
ale
maybe
grab
some
for
an
athletic
drinking
event
since
it
goes
down
easy
overall
not
a
bad
brown
ale
sweet
and
nutty
is
how
i
would
describe
it
in
both
taste
and
aroma
nicely
balanced
not
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
but
a
solid
choice
none
the
less
o
this
was
a
little
sweeter
than
most
brown
ales
that
ive
had
before
and
im
not
complaining
i
would
rather
have
my
brown
ale
finish
sweet
rather
than
dry
lots
of
nutiness
with
layers
of
roasted
and
sweet
malt
flavors
surprised
this
is
not
rated
higher
really
overall
just
too
weak
too
hard
to
really
pick
any
good
flavors
out
the
sixpack
will
definatly
be
an
easy
kill
but
not
something
i
would
ever
buy
kind
of
a
lackluster
style
imo
but
even
so
there
are
many
better
examples
out
there
at
the
same
price
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
brown
ale
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
this
again
pours
a
clear
ruby
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
creamy
head
and
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is
sweet
maltsearthy
hops
and
toffeethe
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
lacks
for
my
liking
with
tastes
of
caramelsweet
toffee
maltsripe
plums
and
finished
with
a
mix
of
brown
sugar
and
earthy
herbal
hops
and
overall
i
was
expecting
more
cheers
moose
drool
poured
an
almsot
blacked
color
with
very
little
head
the
smell
was
very
weak
but
a
bit
of
a
smokey
order
can
be
picked
up
the
taste
was
lite
but
had
a
little
bit
of
a
smokey
flavor
a
malty
note
can
be
picked
up
the
flavor
was
a
bit
too
weak
and
watery
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
can
be
enjoyed
but
it
does
have
a
weak
flavor
overal
a
solid
brown
ale
i
would
enjoy
again
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
ive
had
a
few
brown
ales
in
my
day
and
this
one
is
among
the
best
would
certainly
recomend
it
pours
brown
with
reddish
orange
hues
and
a
rocky
sand
colored
head
smells
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
kind
of
like
burnt
chocolate
and
treacle
with
a
hint
of
coffee
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
low
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
with
a
nice
roasted
flavor
d
not
bad
pretty
good
for
a
american
brown
ale
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
friends
and
other
beer
drinkers
solid
roasted
and
nut
malt
profile
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
receded
quite
a
bit
and
left
some
patchy
lacing
behind
aroma
of
toasted
biscuits
and
cocoa
bready
taste
toasty
some
cocoa
bitterness
mild
sensation
of
earthy
hops
lightmedium
body
moderately
carbonated
and
fairly
drinkable
though
id
say
one
glasssample
is
quite
enough
my
impression
is
that
this
is
a
nice
characterful
yet
still
casual
brown
ale
definitely
above
average
i
get
the
feeling
its
true
character
is
more
accurately
revealed
bottled
though
still
ontap
its
a
pretty
good
choice
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
coming
through
with
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
caramel
taste
is
also
malty
caramel
a
bit
of
nuts
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
pours
a
rich
brown
color
with
an
off
white
cap
aromas
of
caramel
toffee
biscuit
and
alittle
floral
in
the
taste
nutty
maltyness
caramel
chocolate
brown
sugar
and
enough
hop
bitterness
to
keep
the
malt
sweetness
in
check
medium
bodied
brew
ample
carbonation
and
pleasant
all
around
a
solid
malty
brew
worthy
of
sessioning
o
i
found
this
beer
tasty
enough
and
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
o
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
i
love
that
they
come
in
a
can
for
when
i
go
fishing
i
like
the
thickness
in
the
beer
o
a
very
good
brown
ale
for
the
price
poured
from
the
can
into
my
geordie
schooner
brown
color
reminiscent
of
a
drooling
moose
one
finger
head
dissipated
into
a
light
tan
ring
toasty
aroma
mostly
malt
toasty
roasted
flavor
once
again
heavy
on
the
malt
mouthfeel
was
easy
drinking
although
the
carbonation
went
away
pretty
quickly
as
the
brew
warmed
tried
this
one
in
oregon
only
because
people
always
ask
for
it
on
the
east
coast
it
was
a
descent
brown
soft
and
malty
had
an
ok
grainy
crispiness
finish
was
fairly
weak
ovrall
it
was
just
an
ok
average
brown
beer
for
a
little
more
flaverful
summer
style
overall
impression
although
there
are
some
bolder
american
browns
this
one
is
classic
and
a
trail
blazer
it
has
a
nice
malt
profile
but
a
little
underhopped
by
todays
american
brown
standards
still
worth
trying
as
for
the
overall
quality
i
think
ti
was
a
decent
beer
and
not
something
that
will
turn
people
off
i
dont
know
if
any
of
you
wanted
brown
ales
to
have
a
bit
more
roasted
characteristic
in
the
flavor
profile
greatly
balanced
on
the
malty
side
but
full
of
rich
character
and
hop
balance
very
easy
to
drink
with
rich
flavors
throughout
awesome
beer
from
several
other
occasions
i
believe
moose
drool
can
be
better
so
id
say
its
average
on
drinkability
even
though
i
didnt
care
for
this
particular
bottle
and
if
i
have
it
again
and
have
a
better
bottle
ill
revise
my
other
rankings
o
certainly
not
a
great
beer
but
a
pretty
solid
brown
ale
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
pretty
enjoyable
took
a
chance
on
this
one
and
was
glad
i
did
pours
very
dark
smells
smokey
and
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
spice
it
tastes
pretty
much
how
it
smells
it
has
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
the
chocolate
malty
and
caramel
flavors
really
come
though
with
a
little
bite
from
the
hops
in
there
as
well
the
finish
is
chocolate
remnants
and
malts
not
much
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
which
is
fine
with
me
very
good
colder
weather
or
holiday
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
brown
to
seek
out
when
on
an
adventure
to
the
west
i
would
buy
again
if
given
the
opportunity
this
ones
fast
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
goto
brown
ales
sporting
a
thin
creamy
head
1
to
1
5
finger
in
thickness
and
a
deep
brown
mahogany
color
body
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
scented
with
notes
of
honey
and
warm
butter
this
is
one
fine
smooth
drinking
beer
huge
fan
moose
drool
pours
out
clear
and
rubymahogany
brown
with
a
nice
head
that
gives
way
to
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
but
is
predominately
sweet
toasty
malts
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
despite
its
deeper
coloring
isnt
overpowering
with
its
taste
profile
the
initial
flavor
is
of
toasted
grains
with
a
dry
cocoa
taste
on
the
finish
there
are
some
bittering
hops
there
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
but
the
bitterness
doesnt
linger
this
is
an
extremely
balanced
and
clean
finishing
beer
overall
a
tasty
brown
ale
brown
ales
are
about
my
favorite
beer
style
so
i
might
hold
them
to
a
higher
standard
and
this
one
is
a
little
better
than
average
but
thats
about
it
d
a
very
good
drinking
beer
session
good
for
food
bbq
bar
food
meat
nice
all
around
not
outstanding
but
sessionable
to
a
degree
o
wow
a
very
delicious
and
satisfying
brown
ale
not
a
style
i
frequent
but
this
is
great
stuff
glad
ive
got
one
more
stowed
away
in
the
fridge
dont
know
when
ill
get
it
again
i
really
liked
this
one
and
may
not
be
rating
it
high
enough
overall
i
would
make
this
my
session
beer
if
i
could
get
it
anywhere
close
to
home
my
neighbor
bought
me
two
cans
on
a
flight
back
from
alaska
and
i
am
much
appreciative
o
a
very
easydrinking
pleasant
brown
ale
does
not
have
the
complexity
of
a
worldclass
beer
but
this
is
a
nice
brew
will
definitely
buy
again
pours
an
opaque
chocolaty
brown
with
a
thick
fairly
persistent
pale
tan
head
strong
malty
aroma
has
tones
of
yeast
toffee
and
caramel
lively
flavor
is
yeasty
and
malty
with
a
toffee
undertone
and
even
a
smoky
hint
texture
is
quite
fizzy
leaving
behind
a
strong
and
persistent
tingle
im
glad
i
found
this
one
poured
this
american
brown
ale
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
beer
poured
a
dark
walnut
color
very
nice
clarity
it
produced
a
nice
thick
tan
head
average
head
retention
the
aroma
was
very
nutty
and
smelled
of
fresh
baked
bread
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
there
is
a
taste
of
deeply
roasted
malt
nuts
and
fresh
baked
bread
overall
i
think
this
is
an
average
american
brown
i
dont
know
what
all
of
the
fuss
is
about
moose
drool
is
the
1st
tgif
beer
of
the
night
the
drool
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
the
appearance
is
good
the
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
creamy
offwhite
head
the
smell
included
malt
and
caramel
the
taste
was
good
would
like
a
bit
more
body
the
definite
maltbread
taste
was
tinges
of
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
good
and
this
is
a
good
session
beer
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
with
a
heavier
roasted
character
than
expected
toasty
and
slightly
burnt
tasting
with
hints
of
deep
roasted
nutiness
caramel
toffee
andtoast
slight
sweetness
underneath
dry
finish
very
versatile
brown
ale
i
would
drink
this
year
round
but
crave
it
in
hot
weather
o
this
is
better
than
i
expected
its
a
very
smooth
sweet
brown
ale
flavor
could
be
a
little
more
pronounced
but
this
is
very
drinkable
and
i
could
easily
put
down
a
6pk
i
expected
so
much
more
out
of
this
beer
rather
disappointed
the
color
is
a
dark
nut
brown
that
is
almost
opaque
but
shows
ruby
highlights
when
held
into
the
light
the
nose
is
malt
forward
and
has
a
strong
hazelnut
presence
the
taste
is
malty
and
very
nutty
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
carbonation
tasty
brown
that
is
super
drinkable
and
readily
available
pours
a
brownish
purple
with
a
huge
bright
white
head
the
aroma
is
woody
and
malty
with
toasted
nut
dark
caramel
and
rye
bread
the
aroma
is
smoky
with
molassas
and
dark
rye
toast
and
a
surprisingly
sweet
hop
sting
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
with
a
long
woody
bitterness
finishing
it
out
drinkable
and
easy
o
a
good
beer
that
makes
me
want
to
try
more
of
big
skys
styles
unfortunately
this
has
been
the
only
one
ive
found
where
i
live
so
far
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
likes
a
sweeter
beer
with
thickness
hell
id
reccomend
it
to
anyone
actually
o
very
impressed
with
this
beer
wish
i
had
a
case
of
it
laying
around
had
this
on
tap
at
my
local
pub
im
a
fan
of
brown
ales
and
who
doesnt
love
a
moose
well
sadly
that
was
the
end
of
my
enjoyment
with
this
ale
it
was
black
in
color
and
had
a
plesent
smell
but
the
taste
was
far
too
nutty
for
me
every
gulp
made
me
regret
asking
for
it
but
as
a
lover
of
beer
i
had
to
finish
it
i
still
love
brown
ales
but
moose
drool
was
not
for
me
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
if
you
are
a
fan
of
brown
ales
then
this
is
a
must
try
its
very
affordable
and
a
pleasure
every
time
i
buy
it
its
sweet
smooth
dark
and
extremely
enjoyable
great
as
a
dessert
beer
the
only
drawback
is
i
would
not
recomend
drinking
a
whole
bunch
of
them
the
first
one
or
two
are
great
then
the
taste
gets
kind
of
old
it
would
be
like
eating
a
ton
of
ice
cream
its
good
tasting
but
i
dont
think
i
want
to
eat
the
whole
tub
o
this
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
i
will
continue
to
crush
moose
drool
by
the
six
pack
on
hot
summer
days
and
in
the
shower
though
it
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
its
a
great
intro
brown
that
does
the
trick
id
drink
it
again
wont
set
out
to
acquire
it
but
if
presented
to
me
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
not
bad
i
wasnt
too
impressed
upon
first
pour
however
this
beer
did
come
around
and
produce
a
good
mix
of
malts
with
just
enough
bitterness
it
does
fit
the
wide
scope
of
an
american
brown
ale
o
a
decent
brown
ale
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
id
prefer
over
this
one
mouthfeel
is
smooth
crisp
a
bit
fizzy
and
moderately
dry
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brown
ale
that
worked
well
on
a
rainy
night
do
drinkability
is
huge
although
there
are
better
brown
ale
options
available
at
most
places
would
recommend
to
someone
trying
to
get
into
the
style
drool
pours
a
dark
rubytinged
brownish
amber
with
a
gigantic
long
lasting
creamy
tan
head
my
first
thoughts
when
smelling
the
beer
is
of
dark
chocolate
almost
like
bittersweet
chocolate
chocolate
gives
way
to
some
hints
of
raisin
and
plum
taste
is
surprisingly
fruity
chased
by
delicious
notes
of
toffee
malt
sweetness
chocolate
from
the
nose
fails
to
really
stand
out
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
light
hop
bitterness
finishes
medium
body
and
decent
carbonation
maybe
a
little
bit
on
the
high
side
over
all
this
is
a
pretty
solid
example
of
the
amber
style
and
at
5
3
abv
its
also
pretty
close
to
being
sessionable
this
beer
poured
very
nice
with
a
decent
head
and
brown
color
that
was
releiving
since
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
of
this
beer
given
the
name
it
was
a
malty
smell
that
hit
me
first
then
some
tin
the
flavor
was
very
good
malty
and
slightly
sweet
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
it
was
a
bit
thin
and
watery
for
such
a
nice
appearing
and
tasting
beer
but
not
too
shabby
overall
a
good
beer
to
have
if
youre
ever
throwing
them
back
in
billings
with
the
locals
overall
an
absolutely
incredible
brown
i
could
see
myself
putting
away
a
sixer
while
either
grilling
in
july
or
sitting
in
front
of
a
fire
during
brutal
winter
months
affordable
and
easy
to
find
this
is
definitely
a
must
have
this
is
good
stuff
moose
drool
is
a
well
respected
brown
ale
and
it
deserves
the
reputation
it
is
a
solidly
made
and
very
drinkable
american
version
of
the
style
this
is
my
second
time
trying
it
and
i
think
it
will
certainly
be
considered
the
next
time
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
classic
brown
not
ground
breaking
by
any
means
but
quite
tasty
overall
solid
for
a
brown
nothing
special
but
definitely
not
one
i
would
avoid
in
the
future
if
i
get
the
chance
to
pick
it
up
moderate
abv
clocking
in
at
just
over
5
certainly
helps
it
out
also
not
overwhelming
to
the
palate
and
it
doesnt
sit
heavy
at
all
much
like
the
smell
just
plain
ol
good
a
very
clean
tasting
and
solid
brown
ale
i
love
the
name
as
well
my
new
favorite
brown
ale
i
think
though
that
the
can
cant
be
beat
overall
my
first
experience
with
big
sky
brewing
this
is
a
pretty
good
introduction
opinion
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
and
think
that
it
may
be
my
favorite
in
this
style
i
knew
that
i
always
really
enjoyed
it
when
i
was
in
montana
now
that
i
can
sit
down
and
review
it
it
solidifies
that
i
will
be
drinking
this
beer
regularly
this
was
a
good
beer
but
without
and
dryness
at
the
end
it
felt
very
unbalanced
i
probably
wouldnt
come
back
for
more
overall
not
bad
but
not
super
impressed
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
super
exciting
pretty
average
very
easy
drinking
o
pretty
enjoyable
brown
ale
definitely
worth
drinking
again
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
something
id
write
home
about
maybe
a
good
gateway
for
my
friends
a
wonderful
brown
ale
im
not
a
big
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
is
almost
as
robust
as
a
porter
very
rich
and
nuanced
it
reminds
me
of
goose
island
mild
winter
and
it
just
as
good
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
very
easy
drinking
will
likely
become
a
new
favorite
as
its
readily
available
and
decently
priced
highly
recommended
o
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
this
beer
anytime
soon
i
tried
it
a
few
years
back
though
i
dont
remember
much
of
how
it
went
to
be
honest
and
if
i
remember
correctly
the
only
reason
i
bought
it
in
the
first
place
was
because
i
liked
the
name
a
friend
brought
a
six
pack
over
a
couple
nights
ago
and
so
i
gave
it
another
go
above
is
what
i
think
now
md
slightly
thicker
than
medium
mouthfeel
slightly
creamy
but
smooth
and
enjoyable
very
drinkable
sneaky
thick
and
filling
but
a
solid
brew
i
know
that
this
beer
had
some
good
reviews
but
when
it
comes
to
an
american
brown
ale
i
think
ill
stick
with
shorts
bells
new
holland
and
even
leinies
im
not
always
in
the
mood
for
brown
ales
but
when
i
am
moose
drool
is
often
where
i
go
nice
sweet
hazelnut
nose
bit
of
vanilla
in
there
too
taste
is
malty
and
nutty
slight
bitterness
comes
at
the
end
with
some
acidity
at
the
finish
i
like
how
this
is
not
too
sweet
its
dry
and
balanced
the
mouthfeel
was
fairly
thin
which
makes
this
ale
pretty
easy
drinking
as
well
just
nice
and
solid
and
easy
to
drink
i
love
the
label
on
the
bottle
now
that
i
would
rate
a
5
m
d
easily
drinkable
not
overly
sweet
decent
nutty
and
earthy
aftertaste
decent
overall
there
were
also
some
roasty
chocolate
flavors
for
good
measure
as
well
it
finished
dry
and
made
me
want
another
sip
but
with
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
in
my
opinion
i
can
see
why
this
is
considered
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
a
less
hop
forward
version
of
the
style
according
to
the
bjcp
ontap
at
peoples
wasnt
really
impressed
by
any
aspect
of
this
beer
kind
of
surprised
people
had
this
on
tap
considering
their
other
decent
selections
yes
it
is
in
fact
a
brown
ale
but
not
a
very
good
one
ill
skip
this
in
the
future
to
check
out
some
of
their
other
tap
selections
great
name
average
beer
disappointment
the
cpj
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
nothing
uber
complex
or
too
simple
nice
flavor
profile
and
low
abv
could
make
this
a
really
nice
six
pack
to
take
down
thanks
to
websherpa
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
the
taste
brings
the
malts
just
as
it
smells
with
some
nutty
notes
and
smokey
sweetness
like
toffee
and
perhaps
a
tad
of
brown
sugar
i
drank
this
with
some
mooses
tooth
santas
little
helper
pizza
yum
an
enjoyable
drinkable
brown
its
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
id
put
away
a
glass
or
two
if
it
was
put
in
front
of
me
horrible
name
though
good
beer
review
from
my
notes
drinkability
its
a
great
session
beer
on
a
warm
summer
night
or
a
welcome
treat
to
end
a
perfect
powder
day
at
the
local
hill
i
love
this
beer
nothing
world
class
but
its
a
standard
here
for
a
reason
d
overall
an
enjoyable
brown
i
would
definitely
drink
this
it
does
have
a
slightly
odd
character
though
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
amount
of
tan
head
with
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
with
roasted
malt
and
some
alcohol
the
taste
begins
very
malty
with
hints
of
roasted
malts
but
still
fairly
generic
the
taste
ends
with
some
rough
alcohol
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
not
too
overcarbonated
or
anything
overall
an
ok
brown
ale
d
a
delicious
brown
ale
i
would
definitely
drink
another
one
the
beer
has
a
brilliant
presentation
in
color
and
aroma
the
color
is
an
amber
brown
and
smells
a
bit
of
fired
wood
and
chocolate
the
beer
does
not
however
live
up
to
expectations
it
is
rather
dry
and
light
and
has
an
excess
of
carbonation
the
head
was
also
excessive
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
recommend
sampling
before
buying
a
12
or
6
pack
as
this
beer
is
definitely
not
for
everyone
final
thought
the
soapy
flavor
and
smell
make
this
beer
awesome
everything
else
makes
this
beer
not
awesome
poured
into
my
newcastle
geordie
schooner
glass
light
beige
head
quickly
fades
atop
a
ridiculously
crystal
clear
brown
ale
hints
of
red
glow
through
in
the
color
smells
nutty
with
some
dark
fruit
caramel
and
sweetness
as
well
taste
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
light
chocolate
caramel
and
almost
like
sweet
molasses
up
front
flavors
of
roasted
and
black
malts
work
their
way
into
the
palate
as
the
taste
evolves
accompanied
by
a
nice
hop
bitterness
to
battle
the
sweetness
i
like
a
little
heavier
of
a
mouthfeel
than
this
offers
but
the
lighter
feel
is
not
surprising
considering
the
crystal
appearance
while
im
sitting
here
enjoying
this
beer
inside
during
the
winter
i
can
just
as
easily
imagine
this
being
equally
as
refreshing
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
the
slightly
sweet
nutty
personality
of
this
brown
ale
would
be
appealing
enough
on
its
own
but
is
confused
somewhat
by
the
detectable
acidity
in
both
taste
and
smell
still
it
is
able
to
survive
its
missteps
enough
to
be
regarded
as
one
of
american
brewings
modern
classics
d
not
as
high
as
some
d
goes
down
smooth
and
satisfying
a
nice
lightly
robust
beer
for
those
times
when
you
want
something
substantial
but
you
may
want
a
few
very
nice
drinkabilityi
only
bought
one
of
these
but
really
liked
it
and
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
cheers
d
pretty
good
nothing
overly
special
but
a
tasty
sessionable
that
is
worth
trying
served
in
goblet
at
refrigerator
temperature
received
as
a
gift
apparently
it
is
not
easy
to
find
in
this
area
detroit
pours
with
a
thin
light
head
which
fades
quickly
to
a
slight
lacing
aroma
is
as
expected
for
a
brown
ale
with
a
moderate
to
strong
carbonation
no
off
flavors
are
present
flavor
is
primarily
of
roasted
malt
with
subtle
hop
balance
this
is
quite
a
pleasant
brew
for
a
bottle
with
such
a
silly
name
it
is
definitely
recommended
its
real
light
on
the
palate
but
im
sure
i
could
sit
down
and
put
back
a
few
of
these
at
the
bar
drinkability
the
transition
between
flavors
was
fairly
smooth
but
i
just
was
not
blown
away
by
the
flavor
overall
too
much
cocoa
i
think
the
body
is
closer
to
full
then
moderate
carbonation
is
light
and
enhances
the
mouthfeel
overall
a
pretty
nice
malty
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
moose
drool
is
a
moderately
complex
yet
very
drinkable
dark
ale
too
metallic
to
be
pleasant
which
it
just
might
be
without
the
high
level
of
metal
drinkability
is
key
this
one
gets
my
vote
for
a
good
american
brown
ale
definitely
2
for
2
with
big
sky
brewing
no
complaints
here
d

i
could
wish
for
more

the
best
but
its
tolerable

strightforward
way

i
would
definitely
have
this
again
and
wish
i
had
another

overall
this

really
epitomizes
an
average
brown

not
a

quite
a
bit
that
could
be
improved
d
very
drinkable

understand
why
this

of

this

the

was
a

sweet
but
also
very

only
pitfall
is
that
this
beer
is
quite
thin
for
a
brown
ale
would
love
to
see
a
bit
more

for
this

a
smooth

an
oily

body

thin

watery

is
like
a

brown

could
use
a
little
more
body
and
aromatic
malt
to
give
it
a
little
more
flavor
good
training
beer
if
youre
trying
to
work
up
to
the
more
flavorful
stuff
d
very
drinkable
especially
for
a
heavier
beer
this
one
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
but
tastes
expand
still
a
solid
choice
for
a
brown
ale
though
far
from
the
best
out
there
drink
ok
brown
ale
not
my
favorite
have
had
many
more
much
better
browns
worth
a
try
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
the
beer
pours
a
brownish
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
complex
for
a
brown
ale
i
get
some
chocolate
caramel
toffee
hazelnut
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
toffee
chocolate
toasted
malt
and
some
earthy
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
easy
drinking
flavorful
brown
ale
definitely
one
to
try
if
you
get
a
chance
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
finger
off
white
head
with
an
aggressive
pour
there
is
a
slight
amount
of
lacing
as
a
very
thin
cap
settles
this
brew
has
a
sweet
molasses
and
brown
sugar
smell
with
slight
chocolate
and
burnt
malts
a
little
thin
tasting
with
moderate
carbonation
there
is
almost
a
sourness
to
this
but
notes
of
chocolate
and
burnt
malts
are
present
nothing
to
speak
of
for
hop
presence
really
this
is
just
a
plane
old
brown
ale
did
say
this
is
an
all
around
good
beer
minus
the
head
and
dms
the
mouthfeel
could
have
been
a
little
more
firm
but
at
the
same
time
this
beer
is
only
5

oh
well
cheers
big
sky
finally
gettin
down
to
reviewin
this
here
brew
it
pours
a
lovely
clear
ruby
mahogany
topped
by
barely
a
finger
of
light
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
light
chocolate
light
toffee
and
graham
crackers
the
taste
doesnt
deviate
from
the
smell
with
some
extra
wheat
and
a
touch
of
very
light
raisins
and
figs
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
widelyavailable
browns
ive
ever
had
its
pretty
tasty
and
exceedingly
drinkable
not
to
mention
uberaffordable
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
introductory
craft
beer
drink
smooth
and
very
sessionable
on
a
cold
night
d
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
in
the
northern
english
style
d
great
beer
to
relax
with
well
worth
a
try
d
complex
interested
and
yet
still
super
drinkable
this
is
my
favorite
brown
ale
to
date
or
at
least
that
i
can
recall
i
found
a
clone
recipe
and
will
attempt
to
brew
this
on
a
10
gallon
ag
system
this
weekend
the
aftertaste
is
full
of
hops
bitterness
and
the
body
is
medium
its
sort
of
clean
and
crisp
but
i
have
had
crisper
and
cleaner
in
this
style
its
easy
to
drink
and
with
what
i
consider
a
low
abv
many
could
be
enjoyed
in
one
sitting
this
was
a
fine
brown
ale
smooth
nutty
and
balanced
i
ordered
a
second
when
poured
this
beer
i
was
really
loved
how
it
looked
perfect
color
for
a
brown
and
great
head
with
some
lacing
really
nice
the
smell
dropped
off
a
bit
being
dominated
by
a
biscuit
smell
with
bit
of
roastiness
under
it
nice
but
nothing
special
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
with
a
bit
of
coffee
nutiness
and
a
bit
of
caramel
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
bitterness
in
the
back
of
my
mouth
good
light
mouthfeel
with
lively
carbonation
which
complements
the
lighter
flavor
profile
definitely
do
not
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
couldnt
be
a
better
beer
considering
the
nasty
name
d
very
good
drinkability
the
flavors
arent
overpowering
enough
to
keep
you
from
having
many
of
these
glad
i
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
it
is
most
defiantly
super
drinkable
it
is
perfect
for
winter
or
anything
to
do
with
being
outside
when
it
isnt
the
warmest
out
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
mahogany
brown
with
little
head
on
it
that
fades
to
a
little
lace
on
the
surface
the
smell
is
very
caramel
in
nature
lots
of
cocoa
bit
of
orange
in
the
back
it
all
seems
rather
faint
but
its
not
all
that
bad
the
taste
is
quite
cocoay
has
the
slightest
of
bitter
bites
on
the
backend
there
is
still
a
wateriness
that
is
part
of
this
beer
that
i
really
think
dilutes
the
flavor
and
makes
its
taste
rather
mellow
in
nature
it
drinks
really
really
nice
a
good
beer
especially
for
the
price
moderate
carbonation
with
a
light
creamy
mouthfeel
solid
malt
backbone
with
mild
flavors
of
nutty
toffee
and
caramel
just
a
slight
hint
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
no
knockout
flavors
but
very
refreshing
and
easydrinking

the

a

and
a

easy
enough
to
drink
but
there
are
some
major
problems
with
this
bottle
the
body
is
too
light
it
tastes
longaged
and
while
it
is
true
that
this
bottle
is
several
months
old
there
should
still
be
no
papery
flavors
at
its
age
i
will
rereview
if
i
receive
a
better
bottle
d
nothing
too
strong
to
keep
you
from
having
many
many
of
these
on
an
autumn
day
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
some
sweetness
up
front
but
the
first
impression
is
a
mild
bitterness
at
the
back
due
to
roasted
malt
not
a
lot
of
aftertaste
but
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
overall
its
ok
the
sweetness
plays
well
with
the
bitterness
its
a
decent
beer
easy
drinking
with
good
flavor
sessionable
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
must
be
had
from
the
tap
dont
waist
your
time
or
money
buying
it
from
the
bottle
please
dont
review
it

days
hiking

i
recommend
while
eating
a
grizzly

in
roscoe
montana
moose
drool
is
one
of
the
best
year
round
beers
in
the
world
enjoy
it
you
know
its
not
anything
particularly
special
but
yet
its
a
real
nice
brown
toastermm
sent
a
sixer
ill
be
enjoying
this
one
a
couple
bottles
at
a
time
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
nose
brings
through
a
good
amount
of
roasted
brown
malt
paired
with
caramel
and
a
nice
nutty
scent
the
taste
swirls
between
roast
and
sweet
caramel
along
with
faint
hints
of
chocolate
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
nice
brown
ale
and
quite
tasty
overall
if
big
sky
starts
distributing
further
east
this
would
be
a
really
nice
fall
camping
beer
especially
now
that
its
available
in
cans
mouthfeel
not
bad
a
little
thick
and
heavy
but
not
too
hard
to
drink
nothing
about
this
beer
is
especially
good
yet
its
a
decent
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
as
i
said
its
very
autumnal
its
round
maltiness
made
a
good
reprieve
from
some
of
the
hoppier
beers
i
consumed
at
saturdays
football
game
so
i
certainly
found
it
drinkable
in
that
context
tonight
its
still
pretty
quaffable
so
i
give
it
good
marks
in
this
category
another
canned
beer
so
i
was
looking
forward
to
giving
it
a
try
poured
into
the
glass
a
nice
medium
brown
color
with
a
pretty
decent
amount
of
tan
foam
aromas
of
nuts
medium
chocolate
and
lightly
roasted
malt
somewhat
thin
on
the
palate
with
more
roasted
nuts
milk
chocolate
and
a
little
caramel
d
very
drinkable
moose
drool
is
an
excellent
example
of
how
a
beer
can
have
low
abv
yet
pack
a
tremendous
amount
of
flavor
and
still
have
a
substantial
mouthfeel
well
done
i
look
forward
to
try
more
of
big
skys
offerings
crisp
and
bright
but
certainly
stands
on
its
own
two
feet
as
a
brown
ale
rather
light
to
medium
bodied
for
the
style
however
finishes
semidry
and
somewhat
effervescent
a
decidedly
solid
and
drinkable
brew
drinkability
is
ok
roastiness
hurts
it
a
bit
but
definitely
can
drink
a
few
moose

a
deep
brown
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
lingers
the
aroma
is
sweet
nutty

with
some
nice
chocolatey
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
perfectly
balanced

malt
with
earthy
hops
the
finish
is
dry
with
lingering
toasted
malt
and
herbal
hops
d
eh
i
guess
its
drinkable
but
it
just
tastes
bad
so
i
dont
want
to
taste
is
fairly
simple
but
fullbodied
and
wellrounded
with
slightly
sweetsour
earthy
nutty
and
caramelly
sweetness
with
a
faint
hint
of
chocolate
it
has
very
little
bitterness
to
balance
the
light
sweetsour
character
the
feel
is
pretty
full
almost
silky
a
there
is
a
medium
layer
of
compact
head
over
the
surface
of
the
beer

little
spotty

the
beer
drops

drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
easy
to
drink
unoffensive
beer
that
i
can
see
appealing
to
a
massive
amount
of
drinkers
had
this
on
my
fatherinlaws
recommendation
certainly
a
solid
respectable
american
brown
hits
all
the
marks
with
a
fairly
light
chocolatemalt
flavor
with
some
fruitiness
to
it
and
a
mild
but
nice
aroma
of

highly
sessionable

not
particularly
interesting
bottle
pours
a
nice
mahogany
brown
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
head
nice
aroma
of
chocolate
sweet
malts
and
slight
hops
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
nice
balance
of
sweet
darker
malt
and
hops
light
mouthfeel
not
a
huge
brown
ale
drinker
but
this
one
really
surprised
me
as
being
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
it
had
a
balanced
dryness
that
created
an
interesting
balance
to
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
this
balance
gives
it
great
drinkability
overall
a
pretty
standard
but
good
brown
ale
worth
a
try
while
i
dont
always
enjoy
browns
this
is
a
pretty
decent
example
of
the
style
and
could
easily
accompany
a
cool
autumn
evening
i
have
had
this
beer
on
tap
before
but
never
reviewed
this
i
wasnt
ever
too
impressed
with
this
beer
on
tap
or
trout
slayer
on
tap
but
trout
is
a
wheat
beer
so
it
was
kinda
bland
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
it
out
of
the
bottle
and
i
more
impressed
by
the
beer
still
an
easy
drinking
brown
but
it
doesnt
taste
as
watered
down
as
it
did
on
tap
much
better
flavors
appear
this
beer
is
better
bottle
conditioned
i
guess
recommended
i
think
i
will
try
to
make
a
home
brew
recipe
of
this
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
and
enjoy
all
year
round
not
just
during
the
fall
and
winter
months
when
darker
beers
tend
to
be
more
popular
drinks
easy
but
a
touch
more
body
would
help
better
than
draft
but
about
the
same
as
the
bottled
version
if
memory
serves
me
atmosphere
is
very
nice
really
solid
appearance
and
a
nice
full
robust
nose
flavor
has
some
really
nice
components
very
full
flavored
nice
combo
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
quaff
this
is
my
200th
review
on
ba
which
im
more
than
pleased
to
announce
thanks
a
million
to
anyone
who
actually
reads
these
or
anyone
who
has
had
to
put
up
with
the
social
awkwardness
of
me
reviewing
these
with
them
in
bars
the
flavor
is
nutty
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
no
hoppiness
at
all
the
color
is
a
nice
deep
amber
with
a
sweet
nutty
smell
on
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
a
little
watery
so
its
very
drinkable
you
can
drink
these
all
night
long
without
getting
to
full
this
is
one
of
montanas
best
in
my
opinion
an
average
brown
ale
nothing
special
got
in
a
sampler
pack
so
id
get
it
then
but
thats
it
an
enjoyable
brown
ale
big
like
moose
good
enough
to
make
me
salivate
a
bit
i
suppose
but
not
quite
droolworthy
medium
bodied
lots
of
flavor
and
complexity
im
glad
i
gave
this
beer
another
shot
final
notes
a
great
session
beer
or
to
drink
against
a
hearty
meal
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
no
hops
very
smooth
good
amount
of
sweetness
maybe
molasses
to
this
gets
watered
down
on
the
back
9
deevolving
devo
into
another
brown
ale
out
there
price
could
be
better
could
use
more
carbonation
my
thing
is
this
every
beer
they
make
is
better
than
this
d
this
is
a
solid
beer
a
well
made
brown
not
my
favorite
but
never
one
i
would
turn
down
d
pretty
good
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
in
while
who
knew
montana
would
make
a
good
beer
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
fairly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
good
brown
ale
but
wish
the
malts
maintained
their
presence
through
to
the
finish
here
they
kind
of
fade
out
into
the
aftertaste
moose
drool
is
in
every
store
where
i
live
and
often
finds
its
way
into
my
fridge
during
the
summer
they
go
back
easy
and
are
well
suited
to
standing
at
the
barbeque
m
light
carbonation
mixed
well
with
the
beers
flavor
mostly
smooth
and
malty
drinkability
is
fairly
high
the
flavor
profile
is
pleasing
and
the
beer
is
quite
sessionable
i
think
i
like
it
best
on
draft
though
drinkability
is
good
ill
certainly
buy
another
sixer
of
this
stuff
at
its
affordable
overall
rates
pretty
good
and
leaves
me
wanting
a
second
beer
which
is
good
because
ive
got
five
of
them
left
pour
this
into
a
pint
glass
got
a
thin
head
with
not
much
retention
color
was
a
dark
brown
as
expected
got
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
aroma
at
first
which
was
a
little
pleasant
surprise
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
mediocre
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
thought
it
was
a
little
watery
personally
and
didnt
taste
those
hops
i
smelled
earlier
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
mild
with
little
carbonation
it
wen
down
smooth
but
didnt
have
much
taste
so
i
would
not
drink
again
d
very
very
drinkable
i
could
go
for
a
six
pack
on
a
day
off
which
says
enough
i
really
enjoyed
this
brown
the
appearance
was
inviting
and
taste
was
very
well
balanced
with
a
nice
citric
hop
edge
id
definitely
buy
this
one
again
and
id
recommend
it
cheers
drinkability
is
high
because
of
the
light
body
after
a
few
sips
the
hops
took
over
and
the
malt
fell
more
and
more
to
the
background
for
a
brown
ale
that
isnt
what
im
looking
for
a
decent
beer
nonetheless
fairly
easy
to
drink
dthis
is
a
tasty
brew
especially
with
the
low
abv
very
drinkable
with
a
great
balance
and
strong
hop
presence
d
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
a
good
brown
ale
can
be
lots
of
nuances
swirl
around
to
create
an
interesting
but
incredibly
drinkable
beer
that
can
easily
be
sessionable
d
not
particularly
flavorful
so
i
really
would
not
want
to
drink
this
one
again
super
drinkable
definitely
a
great
session
brown
ale
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
type
this
is
one
that
i
will
definitely
try
again
as
well
as
recommend
to
people
who
like
something
like
new
castle
chuggable
drinkability
refreshing
and
a
little
tangy
in
the
finish
this
beer
was
my
introduction
to
the
style
so
i
definitely
have
a
soft
spot
for
it
first
drink
of
moose
drool
all
i
thought
i
had
was
a
bottle
of
pure
sugar
it
is
very
sweet
a
light
flavor
of
coffee
nuts
and
weebit
of
dark
fruits
very
light
alcohol
bites
the
tongue
in
the
aftertaste
fairly
drinkable
beer
and
at
only
5
abv
its
easy
to
drink
two
or
three
not
my
favorite
but
still
a
good
brew
to
have
around
d
very
good
its
certainly
sessionable
d
with
good
flavor
and
a
nice
body
this
one
goes
down
nicely
a
plus
that
it
now
comes
in
a
can
meaning
it
now
makes
for
a
good
tailgatingcamping
beer
really
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drinkgood
roasted
and
sweet
flavors
while
light
enough
to
have
a
few
mouthfeel
is
fine
nice
carbonation
and
light
body
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
im
not
much
for
brown
ales
the
appearance
was
very
inviting
big
tan
head
with
dark
brown
colored
liquid
spicy
aroma
with
coffee
chicory
and
cocoa
really
complex
and
good
the
taste
wasnt
quite
all
that
the
nose
promised
but
was
still
good
mouthfeel
was
fine
but
if
a
bit
creamier
it
would
have
elevated
this
brew
substantially
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
really
did
like
it
and
can
see
why
this
is
such
a
big
seller
in
mt
overall
moose
drool
is
quite
the
solid
brown
that
maintains
all
the
right
elements
i
have
no
idea
why
this
is
a
b
from
both
the
alstrom
brothers
and
from
ba
reviewers
in
general
highly
drinkable
good
session
brew
a
classic
american
brown
that
falls
right
in
the
middle
of
the
style
id
like
to
see
more
browns
like
this
available
faint
aroma
has
hints
of
cocoa
and
maybe
citrus
if
i
strain
moderately
tall
froathy
tan
colored
head
fades
slowly
to
a
film
dark
brown
colored
beer
has
ruby
hues
this
brown
ale
leans
a
little
more
to
the
malty
side
with
moderatley
strong
cocoa
and
bready
malt
flavors
faint
floral
hops
pop
in
towards
the
end
the
finish
is
barely
bitter
with
a
light
astringency
and
a
pinch
of
lactic
tang
moderatley
carbonated
with
a
medium
light
body
besides
the
faintly
sour
finish
id
say
the
beer
falls
somewhere
between
descent
and
good
would
i
buy
more
of
it
this
would
definitely
be
my
go
to
brown
ale
in
a
can
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
wouldnt
mind
having
a
sixpack
in
the
fridge
from
time
to
time
big
blast
of
chewy
sweet
malts
moderate
hop
bittering
to
balance
the
finish
has
a
distinctive
char
from
black
malts
and
a
bready
after
taste
nice
ale
dont
know
if
id
class
it
as
a
brown
ale
more
like
a
sweet
geordie
porter
but
very
drinkable
a
pretty
tasty
brown
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
if
a
moose
was
really
drooling
this
you
could
park
me
under
that
mooses
mouth
all
night
in
reailty
i
would
rate
this
as
a
strong
candidate
for
a
solid
brown
ale
but
i
was
let
down
just
a
little
bit
there
are
better
browns
out
there
to
be
sure
but
this
is
a
quality
example
of
the
style
again
it
was
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
and
probably
the
best
of
the
bunch
its
fighting
with
the
ipa
for
tops
but
i
expected
just
a
little
bit
more
out
of
this
one
being
that
montana
has
cold
cold
winters
i
was
figuring
on
a
more
imperial
level
out
of
this
one
but
im
not
complaining
it
was
darn
tasty
and
recommended
to
my
beer
brethren
a
good
brown
from
a
cold
place
surprised
decent
sized
tan
head
over
a
clear
reddish
brown
body
head
retention
is
pretty
nice
sweetness
is
well
balanced
by
the
hops
fruity
and
somewhat
tart
up
front
but
finishes
with
an
earthy
bready
quality
d
i
remember
having
this
some
8
years
ago
on
a
road
trip
out
west
and
thinking
it
was
pretty
solid
at
the
time
its
kind
of
a
no
frills
american
brown
a
catchy
name
good
marketing
and
being
new
to
michigan
probably
help
with
sales
its
a
nice
option
in
a
can
though
with
more
and
more
micros
offering
cans
its
not
as
big
a
deal
id
say
it
would
go
well
as
a
fishingbeachtailgate
sort
of
beer
when
you
want
a
canned
beer
thats
a
little
more
substantial
than
the
old
standbys
this
is
a
fantastic
brown
ale
it
offers
rich
flavor
without
being
overly
sweet
as
some
tend
to
be
due
to
excessive
chocolate
flavors
added
it
is
very
smooth
as
well
availability
is
my
only
complaint
it
is
sold
over
most
of
the
northern
midwest
and
in
some
of
the
southwest
however
this
is
mostly
bottles
i
spent
two
summers
in
bozeman
mt
and
this
became
my
favorite
drink
out
there
it
goes
perfect
with
some
pizza
for
dinner
fly
fishing
or
just
floating
down
the
madison
id
also
recommend
going
to
a
hot
springs
that
allows
you
to
bring
bottles
and
enjoy
one
during
a
soak
alas
i
am
back
on
the
east
coast
again
and
outside
their
distribution
range
d
this
is
pretty
average
when
it
comes
to
brown
ales
prolly
wouldnt
try
it
again
but
glad
i
got
to
try
it
dthis
beer
was
one
of
my
gateways
into
craft
beerdom
and
its
smooth
flavors
and
ease
of
drinking
spurned
by
a
lighter
body
and
clean
finish
are
certainly
evidence
of
why
that
is
easy
drinking
nice
solid
session
brew
that
could
easily
see
rotation
at
my
house
another
well
crafted
beer
in
a
can
one
of
the
few
brown
ales
that
i
actually
enjoyed
i
can
definitely
drink
these
like
nothing
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
not
too
shabby
the
chocolate
and
coffee
tastes
are
pleasant
enough
although
a
bit
overbearing
making
it
a
good
but
one
dimensional
brown
ale
this
beer
started
out
looking
good
poured
into
a
glass
a
1
inch
head
was
formed
leaving
nice
lacing
about
the
glass
the
smell
was
mild
but
present
including
a
sweet
aroma
of
nuts
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
not
nearly
as
impressive
as
the
look
however
as
the
nutty
aroma
was
replaced
by
a
more
burnt
taste
and
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
had
considerable
carbonation
i
probably
should
have
just
finished
this
beer
while
it
was
cold
but
i
let
it
warm
a
bit
and
that
was
my
mistake
i
then
found
this
beer
to
reveal
more
of
a
tobacco
taste
and
that
was
it
for
me
i
finished
about
half
of
this
beer
and
had
to
stop
to
some
this
review
may
sound
unfair
of
this
beer
but
i
havent
had
to
pour
a
half
a
beer
down
the
drain
voluntarily
in
a
long
long
time
in
the
end
i
found
the
name
of
this
beer
quite
fitting
thank
goodness
i
only
bought
one
to
try
it
out
and
i
hope
the
big
sky
ipa
i
bought
at
the
same
time
saves
my
opinion
of
this
brewer
d
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
not
an
allstar
beer
but
it
makes
for
easy
drinking
d
not
a
terribly
interesting
version
of
the
style
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
inoffensively
d
this
one
goes
down
easy
but
does
so
with
very
little
flavor
or
character
nothing
too
exciting
here
perhaps
a
good
gateway
craft
brew
d
a
nice
find
and
an
aboveaverage
brown
ale
that
is
well
done
more
body
and
this
would
be
a
real
winner
notes
a
nice
local
offering
that
shows
the
diversity
of
craft
beer
production
in
the
us
glad
to
find
it
on
my
travels
around
this
region
id
like
to
try
this
again
fresh
and
on
tap
d
moderate
drinkability
a
bit
filling
is
a
downside
due
to
its
fairly
potent
carbonation
abv
is
manageable
flavors
are
not
overwhelming
a
session
beer
to
a
point
big
sky
is
somewhat
of
a
novelty
as
one
of
the
few
montana
brewery
products
available
any
distance
from
montana
a
very
easy
drinking
brown
color
was
nut
brown
but
a
little
light
for
my
taste
aroma
had
soft
nutty
caramel
notes
as
it
warmed
up
a
little
chocolate
peeked
through
nice
mouthfeel
and
a
very
text
book
brown
ale
good
nut
and
cocoa
flavors
went
very
well
with
my
burger
a
good
overall
experience
color
is
a
dark
caramel
color
allowing
some
light
through
about
one
finger
think
cream
colored
head
that
sticks
and
leaves
very
nice
lacing
throughout
the
drink
smell
is
of
dark
malts
sweet
and
appealing
taste
is
nutty
with
flavors
of
dark
fruits
earthy
and
a
smooth
malty
finish
medium
body
a
very
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
2
of
them
with
my
burger
and
fresh
cut
potato
chips
beautiful
d
drinkability
was
decent
definitely
good
for
23
with
some
bright
moments
but
was
a
bit
sweet
overall
drinks
more
like
a
standard
fruity
ale
rather
a
brown
but
all
goes
down
the
same
d
highly
drinkable
big
sky
continues
to
absolutely
impress
overall
this
seems
to
be
a
good
representation
of
the
style
it
is
an
open
ended
style
so
i
find
it
unfair
to
compare
this
to
some
other
that
have
a
more
extensive
inventory
on
their
ingredients
list
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
roasty
fruity
brown
ale
then
this
is
your
best
bet
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
and
is
under
rated
because
of
the
idea
of
extreme
beer
in
america
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
yrd
house
scottsdale
very
dark
brown
a
little
head
it
was
promising
it
had
some
stouty
qualities
with
licorice
and
chocolate
malts
but
it
was
too
sweet
and
not
so
drinkable
average
mouthfeel
its
popular
as
a
beer
and
maybe
a
root
beer
substitute
had
nearly
3
years
later
and
getting
licorice
with
a
bit
of
astringent
finish
i
had
heard
so
much
about
this
beer
from
friends
who
were
traveling
in
the
big
sky
area
anyway
light
and
pleasant
malt
aroma
with
a
slight
hop
background
that
strengthens
the
longer
it
sits
brown
in
color
and
full
head
that
lingers
not
a
strong
flavor
but
the
hops
are
there
in
taste
but
not
a
dry
finish
thin
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
kinda
like
the
name
suggests
although
i
love
the
name
once
served
in
a
tumbler
glass
look
opaque
black
color
and
red
hues
thin
foamy
head
brown
and
very
bright
acceptable
lacing
smell
roasted
malt
with
chocolate
and
prune
taste
roasted
malt
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
lightly
spicy
hops
mouthfeel
subtly
dry
high
bitterness
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
drinkability
just
good
taken
on
25
january
2010
day
when
salvador
caba√±as
was
attacked
come
on
chavagol
you
still
have
many
goals
to
score
and
tournaments
to
win
moderate
to
heavy
body
solid
brown
ale
drinkability
is
good
its
hard
to
find
a
decent
brown
ale
they
are
far
and
few
and
this
one
really
hits
the
spot
for
a
brew
thats
tastes
good
and
is
easy
to
enjoy
2
0
d
the
taste
is
all
but
gone
by
the
time
i
got
the
to
bottom
of
the
glass
d
not
the
most
flavorful
brown
ale
not
particularly
thick
but
also
not
exactly
refreshing
this
brew
doesnt
do
any
one
thing
great
but
rather
delves
into
all
aspects
of
the
beer
realm
it
is
somewhat
the
jackofalltrades
of
the
beer
world
i
cant
quite
see
what
all
of
the
hype
is
about
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
hits
the
spot
on
a
cold
winter
night
in
all
a
good
beer
and
ill
brink
more
good
brown
also
good
to
cook
with
nice
look
good
slightly
tan
head
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
for
fear
of
becoming
a
chocoholic
crispy
brown
appearance
sweet
brown
bready
malt
in
the
nose
and
candied
nuts
a
sugar
crusted
loaf
of
sweet
bread
mild
chocolate
and
toffee
notes
are
present
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
crisp
mostly
dry
and
malty
in
the
finish
i
will
say
it
barely
earned
the
above
score
another
decent
offering
from
big
sky
dark
brown
copper
color
with
a
creamy
dense
head
and
surprisingly
sticky
lace
smells
straight
up
brown
ale
slight
coffee
caramel
taste
is
heavily
roasted
slightly
burnt
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
a
touch
flat
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
burnt
roast
not
one
for
me
really
theres
an
acidic
aftertaste
thats
staying
with
me
i
wont
stay
with
it
really
d
the
light
mouthfeel
does
lend
to
a
nice
sessionable
ale
nicely
drinkable
probably
not
something
i
would
have
again
but
mainly
just
because
of
style
preference
average
fairly
easy
drinking
brown
ale
not
bad
very
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
ok
retention
smells
of
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
matlyness
flavor
is
good
very
small
hints
of
caramel
flavor
some
hopyyness
but
seems
a
bit
weak
and
has
an
almost
watery
mouth
feel
it
is
fairly
drinkable
but
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
disappointing
this
was
quite
drinkable
and
pleasant
on
the
simple
side
but
id
have
it
again
d
definitely
a
beer
you
could
drink
all
night
long
no
to
cloying
or
filling
drink
ability
was
good
very
sessionable
beer
solid
brown
ale
cant
really
stand
up
to
dfh
indian
brown
ale
my
favorite
in
this
style
but
it
was
worth
a
try
d
the
odd
vegetable
smell
and
flavor
are
a
bit
distracting
and
definitely
limit
the
drinkability
of
this
one
alcohol
is
low
making
this
sessionable
strength
had
this
one
last
about
15
years
ago
was
a
favorite
then
but
i
think
my
tastes
have
definitely
changed
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
again
and
see
how
my
palate
has
progressed
over
the
years
pours
with
a
nice
rich
brown
hue
decent
head
and
lace
flavors
of
toffee
banana
roasted
hazelnuts
and
caramel
yum
finishes
rather
crisp
with
good
grip
balanced
tannins
and
a
nice
nutty
aftertaste
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
i
have
tried
lately
just
taste
next
to
newcastle
if
you
dont
believe
this
is
a
nice
beer
its
nothing
fancy
or
all
that
impressive
but
it
was
nice
to
drink
its
something
that
i
wouldnt
pass
up
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
the
flavor
could
have
been
more
impressive
drinkabilityive
had
plenty
of
these
on
many
occasions
and
will
probably
do
so
in
the
future
due
to
price
and
availability
a
pretty
good
sessionable
brown
ale
brown
color
with
a
frothy
head
i
have
had
this
in
a
bottle
but
recently
found
it
in
a
can
and
decided
to
review
it
again
it
was
about
where
i
remembered
it
with
the
novelty
of
having
come
in
a
can
to
actually
get
me
to
buy
another
six
pack
its
not
bad
but
not
one
that
i
keep
stocked
at
home
nice
malt
structure
in
the
nose
with
some
touches
of
grain
and
hops
some
sweetness
about
the
nose
nice
thick
mouthfeel
is
like
a
mild
syrup
the
attack
is
mostly
sweet
malt
flavors
but
there
is
a
strong
presence
of
grain
some
sweetness
manages
to
cover
the
flavor
and
leave
me
describing
it
as
sweet
it
seems
like
some
of
the
punch
is
missing
from
this
beer
as
it
just
doesnt
have
the
zip
or
it
factor
to
be
rated
any
higher
d
all
in
all
id
say
its
okay
not
good
not
terrible
i
think
there
is
room
to
improve
this
one
to
be
pretty
darn
good
id
like
a
more
interesting
and
potent
aroma
to
accompany
a
more
interesting
and
potent
flavor
i
just
seemed
to
lack
something
well
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
would
be
an
understatement
i
was
quite
a
bit
disappointed
it
tasted
fine
and
had
decent
flavor
but
had
a
good
feel
though
but
just
didnt
sit
that
well
and
not
very
drinkable
whatsoever
i
am
rating
this
beer
low
a
typical
brown
ale
thats
not
overly
sweet
or
overly
bitter
but
perfectly
balanced
its
pretty
ordinary
but
sometimes
you
need
a
regular
beer
d
great
for
the
style
although
i
usually
only
get
it
about
once
a
year
usually
late
autumn
as
a
transition
from
fall
to
winter
beers
its
always
satisfying
i
can
see
why
this
is
one
of
my
dads
all
time
favorite
beers
although
in
recent
years
hes
leaned
more
towards
the
decent
yet
overrated
mac
and
jacks
amber
taste
is
just
mildly
sweet
with
a
toasty
and
hoppy
bitter
finish
not
as
much
depth
as
the
nose
indicates
and
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
but
it
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
quite
drinkable
i
can
see
why
this
is
big
skys
most
popular
a
solid
brown
ale
to
be
had
here
very
drinkable
without
a
doubt
its
a
good
pick
when
it
comes
to
brown
ales
bartender
told
me
it
is
also
available
in
cans
anyone
know
if
this
is
true
and
if
so
where
it
can
be
found
in
chicago
d
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
very
simple
tasty
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
the
first
one
went
down
very
easy
nothing
groundbreaking
here
but
this
is
just
a
solid
brown
ale
with
quality
flavors
and
a
good
sessionable
feel
about
it
portability
in
cans
is
a
plus
i
have
had
better
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
very
good
choice
for
the
style
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
example
this
was
a
decent
brew
yet
lacked
a
few
things
which
kept
it
from
being
a
good
beer
almost
seemed
like
a
work
in
progress
d
the
low
abv
on
this
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
the
flavor
is
pleasant
if
not
exciting
overall
a
good
social
beer
to
share
with
friends
drinkability
a
very
sessionable
and
smooth
brown
ale
this
beer
is
not
too
light
not
too
heavy
it
strikes
me
as
a
perfect
camping
beer
i
will
look
for
this
again
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
a
bit
partial
to
this
beer
as
it
is
brewed
so
close
to
home
and
is
a
staple
of
me
and
my
brothers
camp
out
diet
nuf
said
d
filling
12
beers
with
a
nice
piece
of
poultry
would
be
perfect
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
deasy
to
drink
heavy
sweet
nutty
flavor
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
not
surprising
a
brown
ale
by
definition
should
go
down
smooth
and
easy
mouthfeel
is
balanced
a
little
dry
on
the
palate
but
overall
good
drinkability
had
this
at
burger
jones
in
uptown
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
some
crimson
edges
nice
12
head
the
smell
is
nutty
earthy
with
toffee
and
caramel
smells
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
and
hops
with
a
nutty
caramel
backbone
this
one
is
very
drinkable
and
a
good
brown
d
great
near
perfect
for
sessionability
d
this
a
nice
take
on
a
classic
style
however
its
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
to
consider
it
a
session
beer
very
nicely
crafted
and
well
worth
a
try
i
am
impressed
with
this
beer
it
is
surprising
dark
for
the
style
a
deep
almond
color
the
taste
is
very
rich
and
full
without
being
full
bodied
and
maintaining
a
good
drinkability
i
was
blown
away
by
the
complex
and
smooth
nutty
roasted
flavor
it
is
almost
like
an
oatmeal
stout
in
terms
of
flavor
and
complexity
hops
provide
a
mild
bitterness
that
keep
it
balanced
what
a
great
beer
i
even
like
the
name
definitely
worth
trying
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
red
almost
looks
a
bit
purplish
in
the
light
very
thick
tan
head
forms
slowly
fizzes
down
to
a
medium
ring
around
the
glass
a
couple
streaks
of
lace
stick
smell
is
nice
very
sweet
and
malty
caramel
quite
nutty
some
raisin
dark
fruit
light
chocolate
almond
pits
almost
a
bit
port
like
but
that
could
be
the
age
smells
nice
taste
is
nice
dry
and
biscuity
caramel
malts
nuts
raisin
dark
fruit
a
little
bit
toasty
a
touch
of
chocolate
milk
touch
of
roast
right
in
the
finish
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
not
up
there
with
the
big
boys
but
i
would
certainly
drink
this
if
regularly
available
thanks
eric
nice
big
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
chewyness
and
even
a
bit
of
coffee
quite
good
worth
seeking
out
mouthfeel
had
up
front
zip
with
a
smooth
finish
medium
to
light
body
happy
to
see
this
appear
in
cans
pours
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
large
light
tan
head
that
has
high
retention
though
it
does
dissipate
eventually
good
amount
of
lacing
too
good
looking
beer
smells
of
some
sweet
malts
slightly
nutty
a
bit
of
roast
thrown
in
there
doesnt
taste
like
a
traditional
brown
there
is
the
malt
but
there
is
some
roast
and
some
hop
bitterness
that
makes
for
a
crisp
finish
less
malt
complexity
than
i
expected
but
good
tasting
crisp
nice
session
beer
no
doubt
medium
bodied
with
lovely
medium
carbonation
that
hits
the
spot
slightly
silky
feel
very
drinkable
for
a
brown
again
great
candidate
for
a
session
beer
and
good
to
have
this
in
cans
surprisingly
refreshing
since
it
well
avoids
cloying
good
stuff
certainly
not
what
i
expected
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
the
appearance
was
a
copperish
color
i
wasnt
getting
much
aroma
from
this
just
some
roasted
malt
however
the
falvors
were
quite
big
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
balanced
out
by
a
mellow
hopiness
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
certainly
have
it
again
o
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
big
beer
i
can
see
drinking
a
couple
of
these
it
was
enjoyable
d
an
interesting
beer
with
an
even
more
interesting
name
a
good
departure
from
your
run
of
the
mill
browns
or
ambers
drinkability
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
and
sampled
often
when
i
lived
back
in
w
montana
good
body
excellent
taste
excellent
smell
fits
well
with
my
philosophy
that
if
you
can
see
through
it
it
aint
beer
nice
slightly
smokey
flavor
but
not
an
annoying
aftertaste
regarding
the
smokey
flavor
my
true
montana
story
playing
cards
at
a
friends
house
whose
inlaws
were
staunch
baptists
a
preacher
and
death
on
alcohol
in
any
form
to
avoid
offending
them
we
slipped
drool
into
coke
cans
so
we
could
surrupticiously
imbibe
by
the
way
my
friend
was
known
to
chew
upon
occasion
while
our
attention
was
focused
away
his
dad
picked
up
the
coke
can
and
took
a
drink
we
both
saw
but
had
no
opportunity
to
intervene
his
expression
was
priceless
he
recovered
and
realized
what
he
was
drinking
before
spewing
it
out
but
we
almost
died
trying
to
suppress
our
laughter
this
is
light
bodied
dry
with
some
sweetness
to
it
the
carbonation
is
just
right
this
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
bit
watery
but
decent
mouthfeel
d
a
very
nice
brown
ale
one
of
the
better
if
not
the
best
big
sky
beers
ive
tried
easy
to
put
back
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
as
the
roasted
flavor
is
pleasant
but
not
sickening
drinkability
for
the
most
part
an
excellent
beer
and
sometimes
one
of
the
few
good
beers
available
if
youre
stuck
in
unenlightened
portions
of
the
west
d
very
easy
to
drink
like
12
oz
of
caramel
colored
goodness
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
moose
drool
is
a
deep
amber
almost
brown
color
with
a
tanbrown
head
which
moves
as
a
solid
mass
in
the
glass
the
nose
is
primarily
malt
forward
caramel
and
mild
chocolate
notes
come
to
the
forefront
a
touch
of
smokiness
and
a
faint
whiff
of
hops
the
flavor
is
also
malty
but
the
burnt
acrid
taste
comes
through
a
little
more
strongly
a
bit
of
caramel
and
burnt
toast
hops
to
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
watery
side
and
the
carbonation
is
subdued
but
slightly
creamy
overall
a
drinkable
beer
decent
brown
ale
probably
better
than
actual
moose
drool
i
hope
but
nothing
outstanding
basically
this
wasnt
good
in
the
bottle
and
still
isnt
good
in
the
can
moose
drool
lends
itself
to
be
very
drinkable
a
delicious
yet
nottooheavy
brown
ale
that
provides
a
wealth
of
flavor
at
a
reasonable
abv
d
quite
drinkable
yet
i
always
get
swayed
into
buying
something
that
stands
out
more
this
beer
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
two
finger
of
tan
bubbly
head
that
leaves
wispy
lacing
nose
is
of
grains
and
toasted
malts
slight
toffee
and
caramel
taste
is
of
grains
and
malts
up
front
middle
is
filled
out
with
a
nice
deep
caramel
and
chocolate
base
and
a
bit
of
a
smokiness
to
the
taste
faint
but
there
medium
body
medium
carbonation
feels
somewhat
thin
but
crisp
this
is
easily
a
nice
sessionable
ale
the
smooth
body
was
also
typical
for
the
style
as
was
the
drinkability
these
go
down
smoothly
and
easily
its
been
a
few
years
since
ive
had
a
moose
drool
it
tends
to
get
lost
in
the
crowd
of
great
beers
in
the
pnw
and
im
very
glad
that
ive
revisited
it
worth
trying
and
a
solid
goto
brew
dthis
is
just
a
great
brown
ale
i
could
have
this
over
and
over
again
full
of
flavor
beachshore
oh
yeah
i
would
be
the
envy
of
all
around
me
opening
a
montana
beer
at
the
jersey
shore
bump
ten
fidy
yet
again
not
great
but
really
not
bad
had
this
in
las
vegas
and
knew
nothing
about
it
i
knew
the
brewery
but
not
the
beer
i
dont
like
brown
ales
a
lot
but
this
one
is
good
good
carbonation
not
too
much
malt
alcohol
or
thickness
one
to
try
if
youre
compelled
to
have
a
brown
ale
o
overall
is
pretty
good
drink
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
wanted
more
of
a
very
good
beer
to
have
3
4
or
even
more
of
it
just
doesnt
have
the
complexity
i
hoped
to
see
d
i
always
used
to
buy
this
beer
shortly
after
i
got
into
craft
beer
and
nothing
better
was
available
i
always
enjoyed
it
but
now
having
it
years
later
and
many
tasty
brown
ales
later
it
is
not
as
good
as
i
remember
but
still
a
solid
brown
a
nice
mild
smoky
brown
ale
of
a
deep
deep
amber
with
a
poor
head
and
not
much
lace
but
a
good
density
none
the
less
nose
of
malt
and
apples
pie
and
palate
of
that
but
with
a
nice
smoke
to
it
very
mild
mild
sweet
bitter
finish
but
not
much
of
a
track
of
fruit
other
than
the
apple
pretty
damn
good
either
way
though
ive
had
this
one
from
bottles
and
cans
and
i
must
say
this
is
one
i
definitley
notice
a
difference
in
maybe
the
bottles
i
continue
to
get
are
somewhat
old
but
i
think
the
cans
just
have
a
much
more
in
your
face
full
flavor
regardless
this
is
a
great
beer
for
just
drinking
edit
like
others
have
mentioned
i
am
tasting
a
little
difference
between
the
bottle
and
canned
offerings
the
canned
one
has
a
little
bit
more
of
a
yeasty
flavor
to
it
that
ive
also
gotten
in
the
ska
canned
esb
its
not
better
or
worse
just
slightly
different
it
could
just
be
a
slightly
different
process
needed
to
can
something
in
general
i
prefer
this
on
tap
then
bottles
then
cans
however
the
cans
are
oh
so
convenient
could
have
been
better
balanced
in
my
opinion
i
think
i
would
rather
drink
a
newcastle
over
moose
drool
my
first
big
sky
offering
thanks
to
tedpeer
hopefully
i
can
try
some
other
big
sky
beers
in
the
future
had
this
one
a
while
back
but
took
notes
poured
a
burgundybrown
color
with
light
tan
head
that
faded
quickly
and
left
very
little
lacing
smelled
of
malts
raisins
and
toffee
tasted
of
big
malts
and
fruit
felt
smooth
and
well
carbed
but
just
took
a
lot
for
me
to
finish
it
drinkability
high
this
is
an
almost
elite
brown
ale
good
for
the
price
and
quality
d
very
drinkable
could
easily
be
my
session
beer
d
very
good
brown
ale
with
a
high
drinkability
if
not
for
the
slight
medicinal
off
taste
this
might
have
stood
a
chance
of
becoming
a
staple
in
my
fridge
as
is
i
certainly
wont
turn
one
down
as
they
go
down
smooth
and
easy
carbonation
is
perfect
it
has
the
right
weight
and
has
a
smooth
texture
however
there
are
times
where
it
seems
lacking
perhaps
watery
a
decent
brown
that
doesnt
go
away
too
quickly
d
great
brown
ales
might
not
get
much
better
than
this
its
a
great
beer
from
a
somewhat
boring
style
d
very
easy
to
drink
12oz
bottle
poured
into
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
cola
brown
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
with
great
retention
faded
to
a
thin
bubbly
film
great
lacing
smells
caramel
nutty
a
little
funky
taste
nutty
hazelnut
medium
body
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
nut
brown
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
good
one
im
surprised
that
the
canned
version
seems
different
from
the
other
serving
types
of
this
beer
it
doesnt
make
any
sense
i
say
avoid
the
can
and
stick
with
bottles
and
draft
smells
rich
nutty
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
should
woody
clean
coffee
favors
are
very
clear
and
strong
creamy
mouthfeel
not
very
thick
the
favor
lingers
for
a
short
while
suble
caramel
favors
this
is
my
second
tasting
of
of
moose
drool
seems
to
get
better
the
more
i
try
it
drinkability
really
quite
high
for
something
called
moose
drool
im
actually
pretty
impressed
its
refined
and
subtle
nothing
big
or
bold
but
its
solid
flavorful
and
drinkable
overall
not
a
bad
offering
has
enough
flavor
to
make
a
decent
session
beer
d
this
is
average
for
a
mild
the
flavors
should
meld
together
but
they
just
didnt
it
was
a
bit
complex
and
would
advise
to
reduce
the
ingredients
used
in
the
grain
bill
poured
like
a
brown
ale
very
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
if
held
to
the
light
nose
of
toasted
hazelnut
and
vanilla
tastes
of
hazelnut
vanilla
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
of
hops
feels
light
in
the
mouth
with
a
little
tickle
of
carbonation
drinkable
but
not
a
session
beer
all
in
all
its
an
average
brown
ale
that
is
worth
a
try
happily
the
beer
became
a
worthy
brown
of
average
drinkability
dark
brown
with
a
modest
off
white
head
fair
amount
of
lacings
aroma
is
nutty
roasted
malts
taste
is
nuts
bread
cocoa
and
good
support
from
some
mildly
bitter
hops
slightly
dry
and
astringent
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
for
an
english
brown
but
normal
for
the
us
tongue
this
is
an
average
ale
in
many
ways
but
with
no
bad
character
and
the
5
1
abv
you
could
drink
this
all
night
first
time
i
have
seen
this
in
a
can
tastes
fine
i
do
give
it
higher
marks
on
drinkability
because
of
the
lower
5
1
abv
that
this
beer
has
i
do
have
to
commend
big
sky
on
making
beers
with
lower
abv
than
most
nice
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
an
average
beer
on
a
hot
summer
night
and
not
have
to
worry
about
getting
canned
after
drinking
a
few
of
them
d
we
did
a
blind
tasting
of
7
browns
and
this
beer
was
the
worst
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
down
the
glass
the
head
pretty
quickly
get
reduced
to
a
thin
layer
but
stays
around
for
a
while
the
smell
is
pretty
good
smells
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
a
little
nutty
and
bready
taste
is
good
kind
of
nutty
and
bready
like
the
smell
i
also
think
there
is
a
hint
of
some
chocolate
in
there
pretty
good
overall
i
like
it
ive
been
interested
in
trying
this
one
for
a
while
so
im
glad
i
did
i
like
it
ill
get
again
sometime
its
really
drinkable
and
pretty
good
conclusion
simple
perhaps
a
bit
overly
but
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
brown
ale
this
is
quite
a
bit
better
than
many
american
brown
or
amber
ales
i
had
this
with
some
dry
figs
and
it
was
pretty
good
this
would
be
a
nice
quaffer
of
a
pub
ale
light
and
creamy
mouthfeel
but
on
the
thin
side
with
an
astringent
feel
coming
in
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
easy
to
drink
flavorful
but
doesnt
command
my
attention
and
as
such
would
be
a
good
session
beer
another
solid
entry
from
big
sky
d
easy
session
beer
i
can
and
have
drank
this
stuff
all
night
long
many
times
tasty
beer
and
definitely
one
that
i
try
and
keep
on
hand
light
body
but
hard
to
fault
this
as
a
drinker
picked
up
a
sixer
should
be
well
through
it
by
the
end
of
the
night
drinkability
is
good
for
a
full
flavored
beer
of
only
5
1abv
i
spent
about
two
months
in
montana
drinking
this
i
really
enjoyed
it
then
three
years
ago
now
and
enjoy
it
now
i
was
surprised
and
pleased
to
see
this
in
the
liquor
stores
in
tulsa
ok
recommended
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
nothing
really
special
just
a
nice
drinkable
and
well
balanced
beer
easy
to
enjoy
and
nice
to
have
in
the
fridge
this
is
a
good
american
brown
not
to
be
mistaken
for
an
english
brown
in
any
way
shape
or
form
drink
this
one
next
to
a
newcastle
to
see
what
i
mean
its
bitter
roasty
and
chocolate
but
never
ventures
into
porter
territory
thats
hard
to
pull
off
yet
big
sky
does
it
well
glad
this
made
it
to
kansas
m
tasted
watery
at
the
get
go
but
the
finish
offered
a
subtle
brown
sugar
hint
and
toasty
malt
drinkability
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
an
englishstyle
brown
ale
but
there
is
something
about
it
that
keeps
me
from
really
wanting
another
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
didnt
feel
right
in
the
mouth
but
the
flavor
was
fairly
rich
pours
a
dirty
coke
a
cola
color
with
a
large
bubbly
tan
head
lots
of
visible
carbonation
looks
like
soda
pop
smells
sweet
light
malt
in
there
somewhere
some
very
faint
nutty
notes
as
well
tastes
sweet
right
away
followed
by
some
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
bitter
chocolate
very
balanced
mouthfeel
is
bleak
kind
of
watery
and
not
enough
carbonation
drinkability
is
great
and
now
i
can
get
it
in
cans
bonus
d
it
wore
on
me
the
aftertaste
was
a
bit
sweet
for
me
to
consider
this
as
having
good
drinkability
short
thin
flavors
go
to
short
weak
finish
but
with
a
bit
of
burnt
toast
back
palate
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
just
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
thanks
to
my
friend
alejandro
ysquierdo
pours
clear
ruddy
amber
color
with
a
lighter
amber
along
the
edges
an
inch
an
a
half
head

up

sweet

then
hops
come
through
a
muted
toffee
flavor
is
present
along
with
a
slight

flavor
overall
really
sweet
for
my
taste
but
the
blend
of
flavors
besides
that
is
pretty
good
a
really
drinkable
ale
that
is
more
refreshing
than
filling
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
typical
for
brown
ales
i
always
expect
a
fuller
beer
based
on
the
smell
leaves
me
with
the
same
aftertaste
i
get
after
finishing
a
dark
chocolate
tongue
coated
a
good
sessionable
drinker
notes
bbcsd0903danielle
mouthfeel
is
a
little
weak
for
my
liking
a
bit
too
watery
oh
well
flavor
is
nice
and
chocolatey
mouth
is
full
of
warm
breadiness
as
well
finishes
on
the
sweet
side
not
bad
id
drink
this
again
for
sure
drinkability
is
high
i
downed
this
fairly
quickly
with
ease
recommend
this
one
looks
and
smells
great
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
probably
a
tad
less
impressive
still
a
decent
brown
ale
overall
impression
a
solid
beer
the
toastedroasted
malts
are
not
my
thing
d
this
is
a
really
well
made
brown
ale
with
tons
of
the
smoky
oldcabin
in
the
woods
notes
that
i
love
the
balance
of
nuts
and
fruit
reminds
me
of
one
of
my
favorite
combos
peanuts
and
raisins
ill
be
back
for
more
of
this
one
allaround
good
brown
malty
and
sweet
taste
and
smell
appropriately
balanced
with
hops
without
hops
flavor
or
aroma
to
speak
of
smell
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
and
almost
stale
cardboardy
even
though
the
bottle
is
fresh
according
to
bottle
date
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
after
a
bike
ride
on
the
beach
good
drinking
and
well
worth
the
price
but
not
the
best
brown
i
have
had
edit
i
tried
another
bottle
of
this
and
i
got
the
same
flavor
i
am
officially
done
with
this
beer
i
suppose
i
may
have
gotten
2
bad
bottles
but
quality
control
is
just
as
important
as
the
product
itself
and
something
is
wrong
here
dagain
just
happy
to
be
able
to
get
big
sky
here
now
and
will
be
a
regualar
in
my
fridge
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
very
sessionable
english
brown
from
big
sky
and
refreshing
enough
to
enjoy
in
the
summer
months
mouth
is
medium
and
not
viscous
smooth
with
a
lingering
but
pleasant
aftertaste
this
beer
drinks
very
easy
and
is
really
enjoyable
it
might
be
the
best
brown
ale
10
that
i
have
had
jewbelation
12
would
be
the
only
exception
d
a
nice
enjoyable
brown
ale
low
abv
makes
having
more
than
one
nice
and
easy
heres
an
extra
tasty
brown
ale
ive
had
several
of
these
over
the
years
i
really
like
moose
drool
i
bought
this
six
pack
at
a
local
grocery
store
i
paid
7ish
at
ridleys
which
is
an
associated
grocery
member
in
blackfoot
idaho
so
moose
drool
is
a
dark
pouring
brown
ale
very
nice
brew
with
plenty
of
pop
this
one
like
all
the
others
that
ive
had
in
the
past
pours
with
a
nice
head
more
that
youd
probably
expect
but
it
goes
to
a
mere
lacing
relatively
quickly
within
10
or
15
minutes
moose
drool
tastes
a
bit
more
boozy
than
a
5
1
but
the
mouth
feel
is
great
and
not
too
lite
this
is
a
really
nice
and
nutty
brew
a
brew
to
savor
cheers
dmedium
carbonation
and
not
too
filling
like
i
said
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
i
could
drink
plenty
of
these
this
is
a
decent
brown
that
is
very
filling
oddly
acidic
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
but
no
more
this
beer
poured
a
blackbody
with
a
hint
of
amber
hidden
in
the
light
the
head
seemed
to
be
of
good
size
but
the
bubbles
appeared
rather
large
for
my
taste
it
sets
off
a
smell
of
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
i
found
what
i
smelt
is
exactly
what
i
tasted
in
this
beer
a
good
molasseschocolatecoffeealcohol
the
mouthfeel
seemed
a
little
heavy
on
the
carberation
but
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer

i
like
brown
ale
but
im
not
a

fan
of
moose
drool
its
not
terrible
and
its
my
favorite
of
the
three
big
sky
beers
ive
tried
so
far
maybe
im
spoiled
by
how
good
newcastle
brown
ale
is
so
that
any
other
brown
ale
fails
in
comparison
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
id
drink
it
if
one
was
put
in
front
of
me
its
not
quite
like
sitting
under
a
moose
and
monkeychugging
warm
twiggy
marshwater
and
in
some
ways
thats
dissapointing
but
what
it
is
is
a
good
solid
brown
ale
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
i
tend
to
refrain
from
more
than
one
brown
because
theyre
too
sweet
this
one
is
not
it
could
defnitely
be
sessioned
give
it
a
try
via
colts9016
overallsolid
drinkable
brown
ale
i
can
see
why
this
has
become
a
favorite
its
by
no
means
knock
your
socks
off
fantastic
but
its
a
fine
beer
and
i
give
credit
where
its
due
very
smooth
and
balanced
with
a
few
sweet
notes
here
and
there

thanks
eric
it
is
medium
bodied
not
very
carbonated
and
has
decent
drinkability
i
could
certainly
see
people
enjoying
putting
quite
a
few
of
these
back
not
the
best
brown
ale
out
there
but
certainly
not
the
worst
and
def
worth
giving
a
try

a
dark

a

feeling

and

sessionable
a
nice
beerfun
to
try
quite
a
sweet
aftertaste
left
on
your
tongue
i
remember
a
few
years
ago
my
dad
was
traveling
through
montana
and
he
called
me
to
tell
me
about
this
funny
named
beer
moose
drool
he
couldnt
bring
it
back
and
id
pretty
much
forgotten
about
it
until
my
wife
surprised
me
with
a
package
of
states
i
was
missing
and
lo
and
behold
theres
a
bottle
of
moose
drool
i
had
this
at
dinner
which
was
a
nice
salad
with
spicy
jalepeno
cheese
and
chicken
a
great
looking
caramel
earthy
hopped
brown
ale
worked
perfectly
for
me
a
nice
session
brown
ale
poured
the
color
of
cola
with
a
one
inch
tan
head
that
dissipated
to
nothing
fairly
quickly
nice
looking
brown
ale
otherwise
weak
aroma
was
nothing
special
maybe
detected
a
little
malt
taste
was
good
though
nice
balance
with
a
little
taste
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
a
hint
of
coffee
on
the
finish
no
noticeable
taste
of
alcohol
or
warming
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
beer
pours
dark
dark
brown
mouthfeel
is
watery
taste
is
pretty
good
though
slight
bitter
hops
not
too
much
though
little
raisiny
quick
finish
not
getting
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
but
it
does
have
a
nice
nut
finish
i
had
higher
hopes
but
overall
its
drinkable
just
not
one
i
would
seek
out
by
any
means
overall
not
a
bad
brown
ale
worth
a
try
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
boring
and
average
like
single
malt
scotch
this
is
one
drink
that
is
individualized
not
universal
some
will
love
it
above
all
others
wont
i
think
this
may
have
been
an
older
or
just
bad
batch
there
is
no
date
anywhere
on
the
packaging
d
full
flavor
but
not
filling
moderate
abv
make
it
fairly
drinkable
as
the
sips
continued
the
maltiness
gained
favor
with
my
buds
of
taste
the
beer
had
a
very
good
feel
in
the
mouth
and
the
maltiness
was
not
accompanied
by
the
slug
of
bitterness
like
that
of
a
stout
or
heavily
hopped
porter
the
beer
was
quite
pleasant
to
the
taste
and
a
nice
deviation
off
the
path
of
most
other
ales
ive
had
subtle
sweetness
finally
manifested
as
i
got
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
was
really
quite
nice
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
is
very
dark
clear
appearance
with
a
nice
head
smell
is
enticing
and
very
appealing
but
i
can
not
say
exactly
what
it
smells
like
i
mean
i
can
not
smell
any
grapefruit
bannana
chocolate
caramel
or
floral
or
pine
but
that
is
what
i
like
about
the
smell
it
smells
like
moose
drool
more
importantly
is
the
taste
is
excellant
it
is
like
a
battle
between
the
sweet
malt
at
first
which
gives
way
to
the
slight
bitterness
aftertaste
then
goes
back
to
sweet
then
again
to
bitter
aftertaste
i
like
this
beer
more
than
newcastle
brown
or
sam
adams
brown
this
is
my
new
favorite
brown
ale
you
gotta
love
the
beer
if
not
the
label

d
not
a
big
fan
has
a
big
malty
presence
and
soft
sweet
side
still
it
is
worthy
of
getting
a
hold
of
and
chugging
one
down
no
complaints
in
drinkability
but
nothing
great
either
a
solid
beer
that
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
d
yummy
and
not
filling
and
not
too
expensive
i
love
this
stuff
md
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
a
nice
session
brew
that
i
wish
i
had
more
access
to
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
with
much
carbonation
and
a
lightly
oily
finish
a
very
drinkable
highly
available
brown
ale
notes
from
063004
i
also
rather
enjoy
the
thought
of
drinking
moose
drool
the
novelty
of
it
puts
a
smile
on
my
face
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
not
great
the
finish
is
clean
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
good
overall
a
very
nice
and
sessionable
brown
ale
i
think
this
one
falls
short
of
the
mark
i
dont
like
the
subdued
nose
and
taste
it
also
feels
a
little
like
you
drank
dust
after
its
all
said
and
done
not
a
bad
brew
but
also
not
great
drinkability
is
pretty
high
a
satisfyingly
robust
american
brown
thats
not
to
big
a
very
well
done
example
of
the
style
d
good
session
beer
great
with
a
home
style
chicken
pot
pie
medium
body
with
lower
carbonation
a
very
easy
drinking
session
beer
not
a
bad
brown
ale
definitely
has
a
bit
of
complexity
in
the
somewhat
light
taste
but
nothing
i
will
probably
think
to
purchase
in
the
future
i
had
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
and
i
must
say
i
was
definitely
not
disappointed
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
silky
i
could
session
this
one
appearance
has
a
dark
brown
amber
with
a
thin
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
coffee
with
a
smokiness
to
it
taste
seems
slightly
watered
down
having
a
light
smoke
flavor
thats
nutty
with
the
coffee
and
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
going
down
slick
with
good
carbonation
i
really
like
big
sky
their
beers
seem
to
have
a
little
more
character
than
the
typical
american
microbrew
edit
kgotchers
review
which
i
read
after
i
reviewed
this
beer
seems
to
echo
my
thoughts
exactly
nice
review
kgotcher
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
evening
long
with
its
relatively
low
abv
of
5
1
and
perfect
mix
of
sweetness
and
slight
hoppiness
great
brown
ale
for
the
summertime
not
too
filling
at
all
great
brew
all
around
it
was
definitely
worth
the
shipping
cost
i
have
found
big
sky
beers
to
be
on
the
malty
side
which
i
really
like
this
is
no
dissapointment
although
there
is
a
nice
hop
bite
at
the
end
moose
drool
brown
ale
was
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
tan
head
with
decent
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
sweet
toasty
malt
the
taste
was
roasted
malt
with
some
cocoa
and
some
bitterness
towards
the
dry
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
overall
its
a
good
beer
that
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
d
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
better
than
expected
not
life
changing
not
even
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
not
offensive
and
a
solid
intro
to
craft
beer
for
many
of
those
macro
drinkers
looking
for
something
more
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
one
of
the
better
browns
ive
had
recently
medium
body
smooth
creamy
feel
i
like
this
browns
drinkability
for
sure
i
had
a
second
and
would
have
had
another
had
my
group
not
decided
to
move
on
d
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
i
could
go
for
more
than
one
of
these
anytime
a
really
good
beer
that
i
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
check
this
one
out
if
you
get
the
chance
would
gladly
have
again
i
personally
prefer
a
little
more
hop
bite
but
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
im
not
a
big
brown
ale
fan
and
i
guess
this
one
tells
me
why
just
not
alot
here
to
float
my
boat
medium
body
medium
effervescence
slightly
crisp
and
tingly
a
decent
beer
but
a
little
hoppy
for
a
brown
ale
not
a
bad
beer
overall
glad
i
tried
it
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
again
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
brew
good
session
beer
should
the
mood
stir
me
hyped
by
one
store
beer
geek
given
an
seinfeld
soso
shrug
by
another
im
leaning
toward
the
second
forgettable
drinkability
this
could
make
a
decent
session
beer
it
goes
great
with
most
meats
and
food
in
general
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
love
having
it
onhand
my
preference
is
to
have
it
on
its
own
or
with
a
snack
food

the
aroma
is

giving
off
notes
light
chocolate
and
pumpernickel

the
taste
starts
with
a
dark
toasted
malt
then
to
a
light

the
finish
feels
a
bit
chunky
with
a

never
disappears
and
leaves
some
thin

on
my

smells
of

some

flavor
is
mot
quite
as

is

some

i
like
this
beer
with
food
i
love
the
name
and
it
really
kind
of
tells
you
what
its
all
about
my
thought
on
real
moose
drool
is
that
its
thick
and
heavy
this
is
much
like
the
beer
its
fairly
good
but
a
little
to
heavy
for
my
pallet
my
wife
and
i
1st
tried
this
in
a
great
place
which
slips
my
mind
in
fiddletown
ca
more
of
a
novelty
beer
for
me
smooth
dry
nutty
taste
got
some

that
makes
it
really
enjoyable

just
let
it
sit
in

for

seconds
before
you
swallow
it
pretty
dark
for
a
brown
ale
lacks
the
caramel
sweetness
of
your

brown
ale
almost
a

very

highly
recommend
this
one
d
i
was
on
vacation
at
glacier
national
park
5
years
ago
when
i
was
first
getting
into
craft
beer
i
had
several
of
these
at
the
lodge
during
my
visit
and
i
loved
it
after
all
these
years
i
still
think
this
is
pretty
damn
tasty
thanks
to
johngalt1
for
the
trip
down
memory
lane
d
very
easy
drinking
beer
im
more
of
a
red
fan
but
this
brown
actually
ahs
a
somewhat
creamy
feel
to
it
not
much
carbonation
or
aroma
but
the
flavor
has
a
bit
of
a
kick
at
first
which
mellows
out
in
the
middle
then
has
a
heavymedium
after
feel
another
reason
for
me
to
stop
in
at
fareway
overall
recommend
trying
this
beer
very
enjoyable
for
a
couple
but
not
a

for

this
was
a
surprise
i
found
in
tucson
arizona
it
was
a
very
dark
brew
with
a
great
head
it
was
it
served
in
a
pint
glass
i
was
surprised
of
how
thin
the
body
was
when
this
beer
was
served
to
me
it
was
not
very
cold
i
wonder
how
this
affected
the
characteristics
of
the
body
im
pleasantly
surprised
this
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
or
something
id
be
happy
to
find
in
one
of
those
middling
bars
with
nothing
great
on
tap
and
then
i
get
to
say
moose

will
drink
again
if

the
mouthfeel

ligther

it
is

crafted
this
is
a
must
if
you
prefer
a
nutty
considering
its
modest
abv

and
not
enough
carbonation
the
whole
thing
tasted
just
a
bit
flat
it
was
ok
to
drink
creamy
mouthfeel
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
nothing
big
the
taste
is
wonderfully
malty
but
good
fainter
notes
of
chocolate
and
toffee
some
sweetness
to
the
nose
lightly
sweet
notes
of
chocolate
and
some
caramel
not
enough
hops
to
be
noticeable
which
is
a
plus
for
me
in
regards
to
this
style
tastes
of
caramel
but
not
exactly
something
i
will
be
trying

have
this

em
now
its
more
like
what
was
i
thinking
this
last
one
was
sitting
in
my
fridge
waiting
for
me
to
review
it
perhaps
it
went
bad
dark
brown
in
color
with
plenty
of
light
seeping
through
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
moderate
amount
of
minute
sediment
is
suspended
within
the
body
a
fingernail
of
off
white
to
light
beige
foam
covers
the
vast
majority
of
the
top
light
brussels
lacing
aroma
is
of
chocolate
hazelnut
and
dark
malt
the
flavor
is
muted
than
the
nose
would
indicate
it
is
mostly
dark
malt
and
hazelnut
i
do
detect
a
hint
of
the
sweet
bourbon
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouth
is
dry
and
sticky
12
oz
stubby
poured
into

mostly
clear
brown

a

some

a

of
patchy
lace
barrel
notes
of

and
vanilla
roasty

caramel
malts
a
touch
of
chocolate
taste
is
bready

these
sweet

bitter
components

finish
o
its
alright
a

different
than
the
other
stuff
on
the
market
but
really
nothing
exceptional
murky
brown
with
a
nice
foamy
head
nice
nutty
malt
smell
with
just
a
hint
of
the
barrel
smell
taste
is
normal
malty
nutty
with
a
hop
finish
i
catch
on
to
the
vanilla
which
blends
well
with
the
bourbon
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
i
like
this
combination
this
company
keeps
surprising
me
the
finish
is
extremely
smooth
do
i
detect
cinnamon
this
is
better
than
its
ratings
people
should
know
that
according
to
the
label
only
a
portion
of
this
beer
was
actually
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
then
blended
in
so
its
intentionally
subtle
and
i
for
one
like
and
respect
that
approach
to
this
its
got
all
the
vanilla
and
bourbon
character
you
could
want
in
the
finish
but
it
doesnt
dominate
the
whole
experience
it
lets
all
the
chocolate
malt
and
a
hint
of
coconut
come
out
lighter
in
color
than
expected
it
is
indeed
a
brown
not
anything
darker
and
the
roast
profile
is
moderate
at
best
i
like
its
lightness
though
and
think
it
shows
another
side
of
the
bourbon
barrel
thing
which
is
the
complimentary
flavors
of
the
spirit
and
the
chocolate
malt
its
so
often
lost
to
the
oak
itself
or
the
heavy
roast
or
the
alcohol
content
and
i
think
this
beer
does
a
nice
job
with
all
elements
together
a
little
more
body
would
be
alright
by
my
but
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
the
finish
is
appropriately
long
and
mellow
its
a
little
something
different
and
i
like
that
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
not
what
i
expected
but
i
like
it
not
really
brown
this
pours
a
more
auburn
like
color
the
nose
is
a
light
divide
between
barrel
and
brown
i
catch
some
barley
malt
chocolate
malt
creamy
coconut
vanilla
and

batter
the
flavor

the
feel

it

good
coconut
is
prominent
with
chocolate
malts

still
there

head
nice
lacing
smell
is
a
muted
caramel
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
just
the
slightest
bourbon
taste
is
very
scottish
ale
like
not
much
bourbon
at
all
which
i
like
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
smooth
with
subtle
flavors
that
make
it
immensely
drinkable
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
there
is
an
earthy
malt
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
bourbon
not
bad
but
nothing
special
either
its
worth
trying
decent
to
good
trying
the
rockys
revenge
from
tyranena
brew
co
the
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
brownish
amber
with
thin
slightly
offwhite
head
that
is
not
leaving
much
of
a
lace
dealing
with
congestion
right
now
so
the
scent
for
me
is
faint
certainly
the
presence
of
biscuitbread
the
taste
carries
maple
syrup
touches
of
oak
and
bourbon
the
mouthfeel
is
full
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
easy
going
beer
c
this
marks
another
beer
from
tyranena
that
i
enjoy
im
not
normally
a
brown
ale
fan
but
this
had
flavor
aplenty
if
they
made
an
imperial
version
of
this
with
810
abv
as
a
winter
warmer
or
christmas
beer
it
would
be
off
the
hook
overall
nice
drinkable
brown
ale
but
nothing
too
special
o
with
such
a
mild
abv
for
a
barrel
aged
brew
at
least
partially
the
main
knock
here
is
that
it
is
not
terribly
complex
sort
of
a
twonote
of
malt
and
barrel
the
barrel
is
out
front
in
the
nose
the
malt
in
the
taste
this
was
a
goto
brew
for
me
for
several
years
and
i
still
come
back
though
ive
found
other
browns
that
satisfy
and
offer
greater
depth
mouthfeel
this
tends
to
be
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
compared
to
others
i
have
had
but
still
a
good
version
of
a
brown
ale
o
pretty
good
but
nothing
incredible
seemed
fairly
well
executed
but
i
think
the
style
just
isnt
a
great
fit
for
a
bourbon
barrel
i
would
drink
it
again
final
thoughts
yet
another
interesting
beer
from
a
brewery
im
just
beginning
to
discover
tyranena
never
ceases
to
intrigue
with
their
offerings
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
ontap
o
a
subtle
bourbon
beer
and
one
thats
perfect
for
enjoying
a
couple
of
pints
ofwhich
is
different
for
a
bourbonforward
beer
the
flavors
complement
each
other
nicelynice
beer
there
are
some
really
great
things
going
on
here
but
theres
also
just
too
much
of
a
metallic
presence
coming
in
and
out
to
allow
this
to
reach
its
full
potential
if
the
metallic
aspect
were
gone
this
would
get
a
score
bump
of
a
full
point
rockys
revenge
pours
a
brownish
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
their
is
a
oaky
aroma
with
a
nice
malty
backbone
and
hints
of
coffee
the
taste
has
a
nice
malty
backbone
with
hints
of
oak
and
coffee
nice
full
flavors
just
a
weak
carbonation
overall
a
nice
flavorful
brown
ale
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
pretty
decent
american
brown
ale
if
not
overwhelming
bourbon
notes
are
mild
very
mild
if
i
didnt
read
it
on
the
bottle
i
might
attribute
the
flavors
to
something
else
a
slightly
fuller
body
and
turning
the
dial
up
on
the
bourbon
a
click
or
two
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
glad
to
have
picked
this
up
on
a
recent
trip
to
the
midwest
poured
into
tulip
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
starts
off
a
bit
awkward
and
then
the
barrel
presence
comes
into
play
which
is
nice
however
this
brew
doesnt
seem
to
come
all
the
way
around
and
form
a
cohesive
package
i
am
not
that
impressed
with
this
but
it
isnt
a
terrible
brew
by
any
regards
o
nothing
special
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
despite
some
acidic
and
astringent
flavors
the
beer
could
have
benefitted
from
a
fuller
body
and
a
greater
balance
definitely
hoping
for
some
more
bourbon
from
a
bourbon
beer
overall
this
is
a
nice
bba
porter
sweet
malty
and
not
too
overwhelming
on
the
bourbon
honestly
pretty
sessionable
beer
overall
pretty
much
as
described
as
standard
brown
ale
with
bourbon
which
elevates
the
good
but
not
great
base
beer
nice
to
see
bourbon
used
for
a
lower
alcohol
beer
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
ba
brown
ale
the
bourbon
comes
through
but
doesnt
dominate
it
and
give
the
taste
a
lot
of
vanilla
and
sweetness
lots
of
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
huge
disappointment
the
bourbon
flavor
completely
overwhelms
the
beer
i
would
suggest
a
bolder
brown
ale
base
to
this
beer
i
have
to
give
them
props
i
love
a
good
brown
ale
and
bourbon
could
definitely
jive
with
the
style
i
just
dont
know
if
there
is
a
brown
up
to
the
task
nice
o
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
bourbon
barrelaged
beers
and
was
looking
for
a
little
more
bourbon
here
the
color
and
the
scent
made
me
optimistic
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
left
me
feeling
as
flat
as
this
ale
tyranena
brewing
rockys
revenge
45
o
an
interesting
effort
no
bourbon
character
despite
the
advertisement
very
vanilla
but
not
a
complex
flavor
mediocre
effort
overall
ohad
at
a
tailgate
and
i
finally
found
it
to
do
a
formal
review
a
solid
brew
nothing
amazing
but
i
just
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
o
not
impressed
not
bad
but
probably
would
not
drink
again
besides
the
poor
carbonation
and
muddled
flavors
it
was
not
bad
pours
almost
cola
brown
with
burnt
orange
highlights
and
a
modest
offwhite
head
that
soon
recedes
leaving
a
thin
layer
of
froth
on
the
surface
aroma
smells
mildly
of
brown
sugar
and
milk
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
alcoholic
heat
the
flavor
is
a
blend
of
both
caramel
and
roasted
malt
with
a
solid
hop
presence
and
a
noticeable
oaky
bourbon
accent
the
sweetness
is
most
present
up
front
before
being
subdued
by
the
hops
the
bourbon
presents
most
prominently
in
the
finish
some
black
coffee
can
be
detected
as
well
this
beer
has
a
number
of
elements
working
for
it
as
far
as
the
taste
is
concerned
but
the
downside
is
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
cohesiveness
as
each
aspect
appears
to
assert
itself
in
sequence
as
opposed
to
in
a
balanced
blend
the
carbonation
may
be
a
shade
too
prickly
as
well
dont
get
me
wrong
as
this
is
still
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
but
it
lacks
some
polish
that
could
elevate
it
to
the
next
level
rockys
revenge
poured
a
murky
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
with
about
a
1
5
finger
head
it
smelled
of
sweet
malt
with
a
little
vanilla
the
taste
was
just
like
it
smelled
malty
sweet
with
vanilla
notes
not
much
bourbon
taste
though
there
was
some
alcohol
heat
but
not
much
i
was
expecting
more
barrel
flavor
but
was
let
down
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
could
have
been
much
more
overall
bottom
line
is
that
it
is
a
very
blase
beer
with
not
a
lot
going
on
would
i
rather
have
it
then
a
miller
lite
yes
but
would
i
rather
have
it
then
a

overall
a
nice

brown
ale
40
barrel
aged
mixed
back
to
the
original
base
it
is
easy
drinking
and
lower
abv
but
always
tasty
great
beer
to
drink
drink
in
the
fall
months
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
i
had
on
my
recent
trip
out
west
i
love
the
complexity
and
there
is
a
bit
of
a
taste
of
coconut
that
really
makes
this
stand
apart
this
one
reminds
me
almost
of
a
good
candy
bar
mixed
with
beermay
not
sound
good
but
is
fantastic
this
would
be
a
regular
staple
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
get
it
here
fantastic
beer
rockys
revenge
is
a
refreshing
surprise
brown
ales
are
far
from
my
go
to
style
but
i
like
to
drink
them
from
time
to
time
this
one
seemed
interesting
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
im
glad
i
did
i
think
the
portionaged
is
key
with
this
one
the
barrel
adds
depth
and
integrated
layers
o
an
alright
beer
overall
tbough
nothing
apecial
its
a
bit
too
simplistic
and
undercarbonated
o
the
bourbon
level
reached
with
the
partial
blend
was
good
but
i
didnt
really
like
the
beer
itself
too
much
sort
of
a
flat
brown
tm
the
flavor
has
a
more
mild
bourbon
level
than
the
nose
would
indicate
dry
caramel
malt
and
nuts
get
joined
up
with
the
gentle
bourbon
tones
and
some
milk
chocolate
tones
with
the
finish
allowing
the
nutty
tones
to
dance
on
the
palate
nearly
solo
long
after
the
bourbon
has
faded
out
body
is
somewhat
thinner
and
spritzier
than
expected
carbonation
is
slightly
sluggish
for
the
flavors
appearance
is
brown
with
close
to
finger
of
auburn
head
it
has
a
smell
of
malts
toffee
and
bourbon
taking
a
sip
of
this
and
i
taste
vanilla
bourbon
chocolate
some
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
dry
finish
to
it
some
of
the
sweetness
lingers
too
a
more
interesting
brown
ale
than
most
others
in
my
opinion
and
one
that
is
certainly
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
good
creamy
but
still
light
enough
to
drink
easy
id
be
happy
to
work
through
several
bottles
d
very
good
beer
i
like
the
whole
brown
nut
bourbon
barrel
aged
concept
could
use
a
little
more
bourbon
taste
different
and
while
the
barrel
aging
adds
a
nice
dynamic
to
a
style
that
can
be
hit
or
miss
for
me
but
still
not
the
best
brown
ive
had
overall
ive
been
a
huge
fan
of
tyranena
ever
since
i
tried
their
painted
pumpkin
ladies
ale
last
year
and
decided
to
stop
in
lake
mills
as
i
moved
to
chicago
this
past
weekend
i
was
very
impressed
by
rockys
revenge
and
even
bought
a
6
pack
there
just
so
i
could
take
it
with
me
i
love
tyranenas
beers
and
i
look
forward
to
even
more
of
their
offerings
in
the
future
the
feel
was
pretty
good
medium
body
and
carbonation
somewhat
smooth
and
creamy
but
i
cant
say
it
was
particularly
enjoyable
or
tasty
or
that
id
seek
this
one
out
again
o
im
rating
this
a
bit
high
just
because
i
really
like
the
idea
of
a
beer
that
gets
some
good
bourbon
oak
tannins
in
at
a
moderate
abv
and
in
a
12oz
format
to
boot
these
give
the
beer
a
pretty
damn
good
drinkability

get

with
this
perhaps
its
slightly

it
wasnt
offensive
but
something
just
didnt
sit
right
for
the
style
the
carbonation
was
a
little

heavy
for
a
ba
brown

id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
at
some
point
d
not
so
high
on
alcohol
but
would
not
consider
it
a
session
beer
as
it
settles
in
the
stomach
and
the
complexity
of
flavors
good
price
for
its
value
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
for
brown
ale
lovers
d
oddly
drinkable
most
bourbon
beers
arent
blended
as
well
as
this
not
overpowering
not
off
the
radar
compliments
the
beer
nicely
not
filling
goes
down
easy
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
with
a
different
take
on
a
brown
ale
a
bit
light
for
a
brown
ale
and
the
bourbon
character
doesnt
seem
to
fit
in
all
that
much
not
that
i
didnt
enjoy
it
drinkabilitythis
was
definitely
a
tasty
beer
im
kind
of
a
sucker
for
bba
brews
although
this
was
only
partially
bbad
keeping
the
vanilla
like
tones
or
anything
else
extremely
sweet
to
be
extracted
into
the
brew
this
was
most
likely
a
good
thing
because
it
would
of
probably
overwhelmed

definitely

trying
this

will
most

find
its

thirsty
tonight
or
this
beer
aged
somewhat
well
been
sitting
about
three
months
for
me
and
its
tasting
a
lot
better
than
the
first
day
i
cracked
it
i
think
it
says
something
positive
about
the
beer
that
i
had
a
gi
bcs
last
week
and
this
still
seems
like
it
has
a
full
bourbon
character
after
that
probably
ranks
up
there
with
ellies
brown
ale
as
one
of
the
few
brown
ales
id
order
at
a
bar
or
think
about
buying
packs
of
somewhat
regularly
excepting
of
course
the
imperial
brown
goose
which
is
on
another
level
this
is
a
good
choice
with
a
variety
of
meals
especially
at
kumas
where
they
have
had
bottles
lately
this
has
stoked
my
interest
in
tyranena
again
after
i
found
the
last
couple
of
their
brews
to
be
misses
d
this
was
a
nice
drink
and
i
will
compare
the
taste
and
mouth
to
my
old
time
favorite
guinness
draft
minus
the
foam
i
did
like
it
and
will
buy
it
again
d
while
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
i
wish
this
beer
would
have
pushed
a
little
bit
more
of
the
envelope
here
and
more
along
with
what
i
expected
d
unique
beer
and
more
complex
than
i
was
expecting
from
a
twist
off
drinkable
but
i
could
not
drink
more
than
one
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
fuller
than
medium
with
lots
of
soft
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
right
up
there
with
surly
bender
in
terms
of
american
brown
ales
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
low
carbonation
works
well
with
the
beers
body
and
flavors
this
was
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
and
it
left
my
glass
far
too
fast
i
wish
i
had
a
bunch
more
drinkability
is
excellent
the
brown
is
well
balanced
and
balanced
well
against
the
barrel
this
is
no
heavy
handed
inyourface
bourbon
barrel
more
mellow
and
definitely
at
a
complimentary
level
look
away
for
a
moment
and
you
may
start
to
lose
it
but
its
definitely
there
filling
out
the
edges
and
adding
a
nice
depth
good
stuff
drinkability
is
high
for
me
with
this
beer
it
isnt
massive
yet
has
plenty
to
keep
your
interest
through
multiple
pints
damn
i
miss
being
able
to
drink
this
one
regularly
also
i
really
think
this
beer
belongs
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
abas
i
enjoyed
this
i
think
that
the
fact
that
some
of
the
bourbon
aged
beer
was
mixed
in
with
fresh
really
helped
get
the
flavors
across
without
overdoing
it
this
was
a
pleasant
one
to
sip
at
i
really
should
have
grapped
a
six
pack
of
this
instead
of
just
a
single
d
this
stuff
is
infinitely
drinkable
the
barrel
aging
is
just
right
imparting
a
nice
twist
to
this
ale
two
three
four
in
a
night
wouldnt
be
a
problem
its
nice
to
have
access
to
a
barrel
aged
beer
that
isnt
over
the
top
and
sky
high
in
abv
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
body
could
use
a
bit
more
beef
but
the
bourbon
barrel
worked
great
especially
with
the
low
abv
i
think
i
might
have
another
frothy
and
heavy
very
drinkable
not
quite
a
winter
warmer
and
a
bit
high
for
a
sessionable
beer
i
could
have
several
of
these
and
be
very
happy
poured
into
my
conical
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
rubytinted
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
on
top
little
carbonation
present
smells
of
oak
bread
and
whisps
of
vanilla
the
mouth
is
creamy
and
smooth
this
is
a
very
pleasant
sipper
the
vanilla
notes
are
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
big
toffee
caramel
and
vanilla
sweetness
finishes
lightly
bitter
not
boozy
at
all
which
is
nice
i
like
the
addition
of
the
bourbon
notes
to
this
style
its
a
sweeter
take
but
its
good
good
job
tyranena
recommend
d
im
not
sure
what
was
wrong
with
the
first
bottle
i
had
it
was
significantly
less
carbonated
and
apparently
the
proper
temperature
suppressed
many
of
the
subtle
flavors
but
the
second
bottle
is
a
winner
great
beer
medium
brown
body
very
clear
topped
by
a
sand
colored
head
the
head
shows
good
retention
and
clings
nicely
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
is
mostly
caramelized
brown
sugar
molasses
and
malt
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
mint
flavor
is
amazingly
smooth
with
a
surprising
amount
of
vanillainflected
bourbon
coming
through
herbal
bitterness
cleans
away
any
residual
sweetness
on
the
finish
more
and
more
malt
sweetness
that
again
follows
the
caramelized
nearly
burnt
sugar
notes
form
the
aroma
becomes
more
evident
with
subsequent
sips
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
a
slightly
heavier
body
would
enhance
the
experience
this
has
the
components
of
a
big
beer
in
a
slightly
smaller
format
drinkability
is
ok
a
nice
somewhat
unique
brown
ale
thanks
to
tim
at
heritage
liquors
for
the
recommendation
well
bourbony
but
mostly
oaky
plenty
of
vanilla
for
sure
i
think
the
risk
run
by
whiskeyoaking
a
brown
ale
as
opposed
to
a
porter
or
stout
is
that
the
brew
may
not
hold
up
to
the
process
the
bottle
says
that
a
portion
of
the
batch
is
aged
so
the
brewers
have
acknowledged
as
much
but
the
oaking
dominates
the
beverage
a
brown
ale
does
shine
through
i
can
honestly
say
this
is
my
favorite
beer
at
the
moment
this
is
a
wisconsin
beer
that
i
have
never
seen
in
ohio
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
hand
all
the
time
unfortunately
that
is
not
possible
i
strongly
suggest
picking
this
up
given
the
opportunity
if
you
do
not
like
it
i
will
buy
it
off
you
and
if
you
feel
the
desire
please
beer
mail
me
this
in
exchange
for
great
lakes
or
something
d
gets
too
sour
for
me
but
starts
out
really
nice
i
like
the
subtlety
of
the
bourbon
on
this
but
its
almost
to
the
point
that
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
bourbon
beer
very
smooth
and
velvety
feel
to
the
beer
perfect
carbonation
this
was
one
solid
broubon
brown
i
havent
had
a
bourbonized
brown
but
this
was
certainly
a
wonderful
beer
i
havent
made
up
my
mind
if
i
want
more
bourbon
in
the
nose
but
the
way
this
one
is
it
tastes
and
smells
great
thanks
nate
d
not
too
heavy
of
a
bourbon
style
beer
seems
a
little
too
subtle
wished
it
was
a
little
stronger
enjoyable
beer
would
gladly
drink
another
nice
brew
easy
drinking
decent
d
a
straightforward
but
enjoyable
brown
ale
that
has
a
delicate
creaminess
to
it
that
is
rather
nice
really
sweet
though
more
dessert
like
in
my
opinion
good
stuff
d
very
drinkable
would
go
nicely
with
some
foods
a
good
compromise
also
for
those
who
do
and
dont
like
sweet
beers
i
think
d
i
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
if
i
really
wanted
to
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
enjoy
bourbon
beers
so
this
would
be
a
nice
session
as
it
isnt
that
big
however
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
bourbon
in
it
d
definitely
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
come
across
i
wish
i
had
a
sixpack
at
my
disposal
ill
need
to
go
get
more
this
would
be
a
fantastic
fall
warmer
on
a
cool
crisp
night
with
the
leaves
rustling
in
the
trees
yeah
i
really
need
a
sixpack
pours
a
perfectly
clear
amber
with
a
brown
hue
on
there
head
is
tan
flavor
is
interesting
kind
of
a
tangy
earthy
and
sour
edge
on
there
inky
a
bit
too
get
a
slight
burn
from
boozy
tones
a
nutty
edge
seems
to
be
peeking
from
around
the
corner
feel
has
nipping
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
thick
enough
interesting
to
drink
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
be
meshing
all
that
well
as
there
are
some
unusual
things
going
on
here
but
its
not
undrinkable
interesting
enough
to
try
once
i
guess
drinkability
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
but
its
hard
to
say
that
this
brew
doesnt
go
down
pretty
easy
its
very
drinkable
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
potency
either
way
worth
trying
and
a
tasty
brew
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
plain
ol
brown
a
very
good
brown
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
of
when
the
weather
cools
but
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
is
plenty
pours
a
dark
translucent
brown
color
with
a
shallow
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
with
little
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
is
sweet
chocomalty
with
a
nice
hint
of
caramelbourbon
the
visible
effervescence
winds
down
quickly
the
mouth
feel
has
a
light
body
that
is
complimented
nicely
by
the
same
rich
caramel
malt
and
bourbon
in
the
nose
the
sweet
taste
lingers
nicely
and
finishes
on
the
smoky
side
a
real
nice
drinker
many
thanks
to
maximum12
for
this
opportunity
a
brown
ale
with
very
little
head
rockys
revenge
is
a
sweet
malty
beer
that
packs
a
pleasant
bourbon
barrel
twist
while
my
score
isnt
too
high
this
is
a
really
nice
example
of
two
styles
that
i
normally
dislike
small
bourbon
barrelaged
beer
in
normal
styles
and
brown
ales
my
main
criticism
of
the
beer
is
only
that
its
all
a
bit
mild
which
is
definitely
unexpected
the
brown
ale
is
fairly
nutty
and
spicy
it
has
a
big
sweet
malty
backbone
i
wouldnt
want
one
every
night
but
its
good
stuff
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
has
been
done
with
a
light
touch
within
its
specifications
on
paper
im
not
sure
that
i
would
change
anything
it
just
doesnt
amount
to
enough
for
a
higher
score
d
pretty
good
based
on
the
apperance
and
smell
i
figured
i
woulda
hated
this
one
but
the
taste
is
phenomonal
easy
drinker
that
is
not
too
complex
yet
still
has
a
very
good
flavor
d
pretty
good
the
bourbon
isnt
overpowering
and
its
a
pretty
easydrinking
beer
pours
is
amber
with
a
off
amber
yellow
head
an
odor
of
caramel
sweet
vanilla
and
molasses
not
particularly
sweet
but
a
very
broad
and
one
dimensional
vanilla
flavor
a
nice
vanilla
none
the
less
surprisingly
consistent
for
the
alcohol
content
bottle
states
a
portion
of
the
beer
is
aged
in
bourbon
cask
the
malt
mellowed
out
the
heat
of
the
bourbon
well
a
well
balenced
brew
that
doesnt
forward
a
complex
palate
for
whiskey
lovers
this
beer
is
simple
but
quite
enjoyable
subtle
nice
and
a
bright
autumn
style
not
particularly
sour
at
this
one
either
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
sparse
lacing
and
ok
bubbling
the
aroma
is
a
lovely
toastedmedium
roasted
malt
combine
this
with
a
littl
would
and
some
bourbony
vanilla
simple
mild
roasted
malts
start
the
flavor
off
right
the
faint
bpurbon
and
wood
add
a
smooth
yet
soewhat
grainy
palate
flavorful
subtle
and
quite
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
as
the
flavor
is
nice
but
that
little
bit
of
bourbon
flavor
and
bite
might
keep
someone
from
downing
a
ton
of
this
only
a
slight
deduction
there
d
i
could
session
this
with
no
difficulty
this
beer
isnt
very
strong
by
the
standards
of
most
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
ive
seen
and
i
think
that
the
beer
would
be
better
if
it
had
a
little
more
to
go
with
the
whiskey
so
much
boozy
flavor
i
can
almost
feel
my
face
getting
red
even
though
its
only
listed
at
6
not
available
anywhere
near
me
so
buying
more
isnt
an
option
very
glad
i
got
to
try
it
d
easy
to
finish
and
its
nice
to
try
a
beer
aged
in
bourbon
thats
sessionable
something
ill
definitely
work
into
the
rotation
every
so
often
i
dig
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
regularly
if
i
had
access
to
it
i
guess
it
will
have
to
wait
for
trips
to
wi
lucky
sconnies
the
appearance
of
thsi
was
pretty
dark
but
not
completely
dark
taste
has
a
definite
bourbon
flavor
but
was
not
overpowering
drinkability
is
good
probably
my
favorite
year
round
tyranena
it
is
a
little
light
bodied
which
makes
it
easier
to
drink
than
some
other
sweeter
browns
not
too
much
sticky
aftertaste
on
the
tongue
drinkability
didnt
really
detect
any
bourbon
barrel
character
as
promised
this
one
falls
short
in
a
lot
of
areas
not
much
to
excite
here
overall
a
solid
brown
ale
not
too
heavy
on
the
bourbon
if
its
going
to
be
advertised
as
a
bourbon
brown
ale
then
that
aspect
might
need
to
be
stepped
up
a
little
but
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brown
nothing
spectacular
but
good
beer
d
a
good
brown
ale
with
some
nice
flavorings
this
beer
poured
a
translucent
brown
with
a
thin
1
inch
head
the
head
died
quickly
and
left
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
bourbon
is
prevalent
as
is
caramel
i
found
the
taste
matched
the
smell
this
beer
was
very
thin
for
me
and
i
didnt
enjoy
that
aspect
of
it
overall
this
beer
is
a
great
session
beer
and
nothing
more
upfront
sweet
malty
caramel
taste
bourbon
comes
out
but
is
followedpaired
with
wood
smoke
smooth
and
drinkable
hops
at
the
end
light
almost
fizzy
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
pretty
good
carbonation
an
easy
drinking
beer
overall
a
very
nice
brown
ale
but
i
didnt
think
the
beer
lived
up
to
the
bourbon
ageing
advertisement
on
carrier
would
purchase
again
if
given
the
opportunity
bottle
poured
a
deep
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
great
lacing
aroma
is
dominated
by
vanilla
and
bourbon
with
some
light
alcohol
ester
also
discernable
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
vanilla
and
some
bourbon
medium
body
with
ok
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
was
discernable
probably
one
of
the
most
complex
and
satisfying
brown
ale
i
ever
had
if
you
can
truly
categorise
this
beer
as
such
flavour
mouthfeel
drinkability
a
little
caramel
sweetness
round
in
the
mouth
enough
bitterness
to
carry
it
well
done
this
is
easily
the
most
drinkable
bourbonaged
beer
ive
ever
had
maybe
too
much
so
since
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
it
i
was
left
wanting
more
bourbon
flavors
and
a
bigger
beer
with
that
caveat
its
a
very
tasty
beer
and
at
least
in
wisconsin
a
readily
available
one
definatly
a
very
good
brown
and
i
think
this
one
is
spot
on
for
the
style
i
will
definatly
keep
some
of
this
around
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
the
sitting
especially
during
the
winter
d
this
is
with
the
exception
of
the
devil
over
a
barrel
in
my
opinion
tyranenas
best
beer
in
the
lineup
its
got
some
nice
balance
of
malt
and
the
bourbon
flavor
even
at
6
this
can
be
sessionable
needless
to
say
will
have
again
very
good
beer
this
is
my
first
review
after
a
long
pause
and
i
am
not
disappointed
that
ive
chosen
rockys
revenge
good
not
great
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
your
typical
brown
easy
drinker
pity
about
the
smell
a
nice
brown
otherwise
very
nice
and
drinkable
and
for
a
buck
sixty
nine
a
single
you
cant
beat
it
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
unimpressive
tasty
but
the
bourbon
character
is
quite
subdued
and
the
base
beer
is
a
bit
weak
pours
a
dark
woody
brown
with
a
silky
head
some
lacing
the
nose
has
bourbon
roasted
malts
oak
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
quite
impressive
for
a
brown
ale
the
taste
is
a
bit
lighter
mostly
the
same
components
juts
a
little
less
impressive
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
a
very
nice
ale
indeed
the
bourbon
really
compiments
this
well
this
feels
really
good
in
the
mouth
starts
out
thin
but
really
thickens
up
on
the
tongue
after
the
first
gulp
really
nice
subtle
carbonation
i
gotta
say
i
really
like
this
and
could
certainly
drain
a
few
d
good
drinkability
a
little
bit
underwhelming
but
enjoyable
can
you
say
smooth
overall
a
very
good
brown
ale
one
of
the
better
ive
tried
in
the
category
a
good
brown
ale
but
no
significant
contribution
from
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
md
a
little
thin
and
very
dry
feel
a
good
brown
ale
but
not
a
spectacular
beer
like
so
many
of
the
other
tyranena
beers
i
have
had
drinkability
a
bourbon
beer
that
is
not
over
the
top
nicely
balanced
pours
a
clear
nut
brown
with
a
23
tan
head
aroma
is
slightly
metallic
but
sweet
malt
some
toastyroasty
oak
and
a
hint
of
bourbon
sweetness
taste
is
straight
up
brown
ale
some
moderate
bitterness
but
the
oak
gives
it
a
deeper
rounder
drier
finish
than
others
in
its
class
this
one
is
subtle
but
very
solid
and
probably
the
most
drinkable
barrel
aged
beer
ive
had
d
there
is
something
about
barrelaged
beer
that
gets
me
every
time
i
love
that
oak
flavoraroma
it
makes
me
think
as
i
am
sure
others
do
as
well
that
the
finished
product
is
somehow
more
refined
than
other
beers
now
i
know
that
is
just
bullshit
but
one
could
say
that
the
bourbon
is
imparting
the
beer
with
some
of
its
mystical
qualities
with
that
said
i
enjoyed
my
sixpack
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
minimal
off
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
very
long
but
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
way
down
aroma
is
a
bit
vinous
maybe
im
picking
up
a
bit
of
the
barrel
i
smell
some
caramel
and
a
little
roast
deep
in
the
back
taste
is
an
oakey
boozy
malty
affair
finishes
with
a
bit
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
finished
dry
medium
to
thin
in
body
certainly
an
interesting
brew
although
i
think
my
bottle
may
be
a
bit
old
id
love
to
revisit
this
one
fresh
because
i
think
it
may
be
fantastic
d
a
very
tasty
brew
thats
highly
drinkable
drinkability
this
one
was
interesting
but
not
that
impressive
overall
without
the
bourbon
i
think
it
might
have
been
a
rather
bland
substandard
brown
ale
and
the
bourbon
only
did
so
much
for
it
pours
dark
dark
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
to
a
ring
fairly
quickly
leaving
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
with
a
ton
of
dark
fruits
raisins
and
grapes
and
molasses
on
top
of
malt
base
the
bourbon
is
definitely
present
as
well
in
the
nose
the
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
nose
for
me
and
tastes
a
little
bit
like
a
grape
soda
mixed
with
tea
with
the
huge
sweetness
of
the
dark
fruits
the
first
taste
is
is
of
sweet
malts
and
nuts
up
front
before
giving
way
to
the
fruity
sweetness
and
a
slight
bourbon
burn
through
the
finish
the
finish
is
creamy
and
very
carbonated
which
just
coats
the
mouth
this
is
a
good
american
brown
though
the
sweetness
was
a
tad
overwhelming
for
me
still
very
good
picked
up
a
single
of
this
beer
and
was
not
disappointed
nice
mix
of
flavors
without
too
much
of
the
bourbon
coming
through
ill
have
to
try
some
more
of
this
sometime
brown
ales
arent
particularly
my
favorite
but
theres
something
addicting
about
the
midsip
transition
between
solid
brown
ale
and
bourbon
mellowness
that
i
love
in
this
one
i
could
probably
put
down
a
few
of
these
before
i
realized
it
overall
i
have
to
admit
this
was
not
bad
at
all
i
was
really
impressed
that
the
bourbon
tones
were
not
overblown
but
were
in
fact
nicely
put
together
as
more
of
an
accent
to
a
already
solid
beer
really
a
very
well
done
brown
ale
that
i
would
be
happy
to
try
any
day
dvery
enjoyable
i
tried
this
on
tap
today
before
picking
up
some
bottles
for
some
reason
i
prefer
the
bottled
version
brown
in
color
with
light
wispy
head
and
above
average
prickle
smooth
malty
nose
smooth
sweet
attack
nice
flavor
with
sweet
tones
tempered
by
a
roasted
flavor
and
mild
hop
like
character
at
the
finish
with
actual
hops
presentation
as
the
finish
turns
to
aftertaste
it
leaves
you
wishing
there
was
more
taste
in
the
sip
excellent
by
my
count
no
real
bourbon
notes
but
i
really
like
bourbon
and
would
welcome
it
so
its
possibly
understated
to
me
incredibly
complex
beer
in
a
great
way
it
is
on
a
short
list
of
my
favorite
beers
i
have
tried
in
the
past
few
years
this
one
surprised
me
the
vanilla
and
smoke
undertones
were
excellent
i
like
while
not
a
preferred
style
its
certainly
worth
a
try
pours
maroon
to
brownish
with
a
malty
browl
ale
like
toasty
caramel
and
vanilla
malt
taste
is
somewhat
mild
however
and
while
good
i
got
no
indication
of
bourbon
but
some
tart
bitter
brown
ale
like
malt
some
bittering
hops
playing
a
part
in
the
taste
to
balance
drinkable
but
not
one
of
tyranenas
better
brews
palate
is
great
with
brown
sugar
dark
honey
caramel
and
vanilla
bourbon
presence
is
mild
and
is
noticeable
mid
palate
the
finish
is
dry
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
with
some
light
brown
sugar
the
lower
level
of
carbonation
works
for
the
beer
but
the
finish
is
a
little
watery
before
the
presence
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
is
felt
43
54
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
wish
the
body
had
more
umph
and
carried
the
beer
a
little
more
versus
the
heavier
bourbon
notes
food
notes
pairs
well
with
a
halfdozen
delaware
bluepoints
notes
thanks
to
mully
for
yet
another
great
extra
poured
this
into
my
duvel
tulip
an
aggressive
pour
leads
to
a
light
brown
head
for
a
nice
amber
brown
beer
it
leaves
little
lacing
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
the
bourbon
the
taste
is
really
nice
for
a
brown
ale
i
get
plenty
of
roasted
malts
and
a
great
accent
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
above
average
and
its
a
nice
and
drinkable
beer
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
brown
head
which
does
leave
some
nice
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
nice
little
touch
of
bourbon
for
a
6
abv
brew
with
some
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
big
malt
flavor
bourbon
very
nice
with
some
caramel
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
was
a
treat
to
drink
very
nicely
done
love
the
brews
from
tyranena
ovr
i
actually
like
some
tyranena
beers
especially
some
of
their
brewers
gone
wild
series
but
this
int
one
of
their
best
it
just
seems
like
a
relatively
weak
beer
what
cannot
stand
up
to
againg
i
could
only
fins
this
as
a
12
pack
so
ill
keep
trying
it
and
see
how
it
ages
they
got
their
revenge
allright
on
my
tastebuds

pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
dense
creamy
off
white
head
the
aroma
isnt
as
strong
as
id
like
at
all
it
featured
a
touch
of
bourbon
but
was
pretty
faint
overall
the
flavor
is
a
great
blend
of
bourbon
and
beer
though
the
flavor
of
the
bourbon
comes
through
very
nicely
but
isnt
overpowering
at
all
there
is
a
good
amount
of
maltiness
and
a
touch
of
nuttiness
from
the
brown
ale
the
bourbon
adds
a
bunch
to
the
mouthfeel
giving
a
sharper
edge
than
a
brown
ale
normally
would
pretty
good
drinkability
all
around
served
in
a
twist
off
bottle
bought
in
madison
wi
pours
with
a
nice
head
which
reduces
down
to
a
light
lacing
looks
light
for
a
brown
ale
pick
up
some
malts
and
slight
hop
smell
taste
is
the
same
but
has
a
heavier
hop
presence
and
a
little
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
light
could
drink
alot
of
these
definitely
a
good
beer
and
interpretation
of
an
american
brown
ale
overall
very
drinkable
i
like
the
bourbon
sneaking
up
in
the
back
of
my
throat
the
more
the
beer
disappears
id
put
this
one
in
the
category
of
one
of
my
favorite
browns
which
puts
it
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
beerwise
for
me
drinkability
great
drinkability
thanks
to
the
lower
abv
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
ddecent
tasting
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
a
lower
abv
make
this
easily
sessionable
and
highly
drinkable
overall
an
enjoyable
and
approachable
barrelaged
beer
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
pours
very
dark
amber
with
small
head
smelled
was
light
chocolatecaramel
may
have
been
the
bourbon
too
light
to
really
say
for
sure
taste
was
typical
brown
ale
medium
bitterness
with
sweetness
at
the
end
felt
slightly
fizzy
pretty
good
for
an
amber
not
usually
my
favorite
style
rockys
revenge
is
a
damn
solid
brown
i
didnt
pick
up
on
much
bourbon
but
its
still
a
damn
good
brown
d
this
is
a
fun
session
ale
i
would
want
quite
a
few
more
wish
i
could
get
it
here
this
is
the
3rd
time
ive
had
this
brew
1st
was
when
i
visited
madison
in
july
of
05
my
notes
say
about
the
same
thing
but
i
liked
it
more
this
time
around
really
a
pretty
good
beer
nice
complexity
reminds
me
of
a
west
coast
brown
id
recommend
this
beer
d
this
is
a
very
good
american
brown
i
really
like
the
nuttymalty
flavor
well
tastes
like
carbonated
tea
as
well
only
traces
of
bourbon
noticeable
with
some
nutty
character
and
fine
malts
lacking
in
complexity
but
the
good
carbonation
and
tea
flavors
help
out
drink
ability
somewhat
drinkability
pretty
decent
beer
another
good
outing
by
tyranena
overall
pretty
good
its
not
a
big
beer
you
might
get
from
a
local
brewpub
or
brewery
where
the
entire
brew
was
aged
in
a
bourbon
barrel
and
there
is
gangbusters
of
bourbon
flavor
that
said
it
is
a
quite
drinkable
beer
not
a
session
ale
but
close
with
some
hints
of
bourbon
on
top
of
a
decent
brown
ale
a
fair
amount
of
complexity
if
you
look
for
it
but
the
biggest
player
is
still
the
brown
ale
malts
with
the
bourbon
notes
right
behind
it
drinkability
one
of
the
best
beers
from
a
fantastic
local
brewery
this
stuff
needs
to
be
drunk
by
the
growlerful
typically
fun
marketing
this
was
interesting
brown
ale
i
did
not
get
the
fuller
body
i
was
expecting
but
sweetness
and
slight
slight
syrup
were
present
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
all
the
barrell
aged
beers
but
this
one
is
worth
trying
the
feel
is
creamy
and
smooth
a
nice
warm
buttery
sip
there
isnt
too
much
carbonation
but
theres
a
lot
of
buzz
in
your
mouth
hard
to
describe
sort
of
tangy
in
a
way
i
really
like
this
beer
its
taste
is
great
feels
wonderful
in
your
mouth
and
doesnt
have
much
of
an
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
it
leaves
me
comfortably
warm
and
reaching
for
another
great
stuff
ale
edit
2011
tasting
noticeable
caramel
sweeter
less
dry
than
i
noted
earlier
but
still
nicely
balanced
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
a
good
warmer
on
cold
fall
or
winter
night
without
having
a
lot
of
boubon
aged
brown
ales
i
always
thought
this
would
be
a
very
good
idea
this
beer
is
a
good
example
of
why
the
beer
looks
well
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
mixed
in
and
a
slight
haze
low
levels
of
carbon
dioxide
release
a
dainty
foamstand
that
did
last
the
duration
and
laced
well
up
front
the
aromas
give
a
solid
chocolate
malt
scent
with
some
emphasis
on
sweetness
in
the
range
of
caramel
vanilla
and
a
little
lactose
tastes
give
much
the
same
with
a
higher
emhasis
on
the
vanilla
notes
a
mild
wood
flavor
eminatats
through
the
sweetness
and
balances
well
with
the
timid
hops
and
toasted
grains
any
boubon
flavors
remain
light
and
come
through
late
in
the
finish
aftertaste
the
body
feels
a
bit
heavy
due
to
lighter
co2
but
offers
a
velvety
milky
texture
a
really
good
beer
on
the
verge
of
being
great
thanks

d
a
solidly
drinkable
brown
ale
with
a
nice
bourbon
note
d
overall
a
very
simple
beer
nice
and
tasty
drinkability
is
decent
due
to
the
complexity
of
flavors
and
aroma
present
this
is
a
unique
brew
that
will
take
any
palate
for
a
ride
cheers
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
large
thick
and
light
tan
in
color
the
aroma
is
of
oak
bourbon
chocolate
malt
and
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
more
pronounced
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
nice
velvety
texture
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
the
bourbon
flavor
is
not
as
overpowering
as
it
has
been
in
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
i
have
had
and
i
think
that
adds
to
its
drinkablity
ps
had
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
a
week
ago
and
it
maintained
much
more
of
the
booze
flavor
which
was
abrasive
due
to
the
limpness
of
the
brown
ale
but
was
preferable
over
this
bottled
version
that
said
this
might
not
be
the
best
beer
to
be
bourbon
aging
the
bourbon
dominated
the
aroma
and
flavor
yet
wasnt
that
strong
sure
there
was
a
little
vanilla
and
oak
in
there
too
but
this
beer
was
surprisingly
lowflavor
thats
not
to
say
it
isnt
tasty
or
highly
drinkable
because
it
is
it
just
has
a
lot
of
potential
in
my
mind
that
it
doesnt
live
up
to
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
wellbalanced
and
interesting
but
for
some
reason
it
just
doesnt
hold
my
attention
that
much
that
said
its
perfectly
drinkable
and
i
wish
i
had
more
than
just
one
bottle
and
its
very
versatile
with
cheese
try
it
with
sheeps
milk
manchego
aged
emmental
and
aged
gouda
i
like
anything
bourbon
barrel
aged
so
i
like
this
beer
with
that
said
this
is
a
nice
example
of
what
barrelaging
can
do
but
not
particularly
exciting
pours
a
nice
deep
brown
thats
revealed
to
be
red
when
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
good
head
with
good
staying
power
nicely
caramelmalty
and
some
nice
bourbon
notes
with
some
buttery
notes
near
the
finish
lingering
bourbon
aftertaste
is
pleasant
pretty
good
could
boost
bourbon
character
and
it
would
be
better
i
enjoyed
it
but
probably
wouldnt
rush
back
to
it
good
beer
this
one
poured
the
color
of
a
watered
down
cola
with
a
nice
pillowy
head
and
nice
lacing
head
retention
was
very
good
a
nice
subtle
sweet
aroma
with
maybe
a
hint
of
citrus
light
carbonation
medium
body
nice
balance
in
the
taste
with
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
than
malt
sweetness
didnt
really
taste
the
alcohol
but
could
feel
the
warmth
going
down
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
i
would
dig
this
anywhere
anytime

and
2
row

and
a
taste
of
northern

hops
not
bad
but
not
great
overall
and
appealing
beer
that
should
be
enjoyed
by
all
pours
out
a
chestnut
brown
woody
smell
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
must
be
the
vanilla
being
picked
up
from
the
bourbon
carbonation
is
appropriate
for
the
style
quite
a
nuttyfruity
taste
with
low
hop
levels
i
thought
the
bourbon
was
quite
well
done
definitely
a
bourbon
twang
on
the
finish
but
certainely
not
in
your
face
its
an
enjoyable
brown
ale
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
but
wouldnt
be
first
choice
if
i
ran
into
it
again
d
few
bourbon
beers
are
as
drinkable
as
this
one
the
soft
bourbon
buttery
notes
are
very
enjoyable
single
from
star
liquor
in
madison
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
on
tap
to
compare
bottle
vs
tap
while
a
good
beer
it
did
not
integrate
the
heavy
presence
of
bourbon
into
the
brown
ale
as
well
as
i
had
hoped
bottle
thanks
to
the
generous
jpm30
rich
brown
colour
but
unique
to
get
it
that
way
white
head
that
lasts
a
while
bourbon
aroma
and
bold
bourbon
taste
we
canadians
are
not
normally
into
bourbon
but
a
good
effort
at
it
sourish
byproduct
well
malted
drinkability
is
ok
it
was
bottled
conditioned
or
at
least
had
sediment
in
the
bottom
medium
brown
color
aroma
of
ripe
fruit
esters
toasted
mellow
aroma
this
was
followed
by
a
rich
malt
flavor
a
bit
roastytoasty
medium
bodied
nicely
balaced
by
the
bourbon
flavor
just
missing
the
vanilla
wood
notes
that
would
have
really
launched
this
beer
but
perhaps
the
present
balace
is
more
important
d¬óvery
good
i¬íd
have
another
but
it¬ís
pretty
boozy
in
the
flavor
so
one
more
would
do
it
for
me
drinkability
not
being
a
big
bourbon
drinker
i
have
to
admit
this
beer
was
more
of
a
sipper
for
me
took
awhile
to
finish
i
liked
the
flavor
very
interesting
but
not
an
everyday
drinker
d
very
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
has
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
and
is
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
a
very
nice
looking
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
and
it
smells
good
too
with
some
creamy
chocolate
and
kentucky
bourbon
and
oak
odors
and
it
tastes
fine
too
its
as
it
should
be
nothing
amazing
a
regular
brown
with
the
advertized
bourbon
and
oak
flavors
hints
of
vanilla
a
bit
of
strange
hoppiness
some
burnt
flavors
a
bit
thin
its
not
one
i
would
buy
probably
but
its
pretty
good
and
im
actually
pretty
glad
that
tyranena
is
making
this
as
one
of
their
regular
offerings
mouthfeel
is
a
little
creamy
medium
body
bourbon
flavor
is
very
nice
but
clean
water
dominates
this
brew
has
good
direction
and
a
good
goal
but
overall
i
wish
they
pushed
the
flavor
a
little
farther
im
not
a
bourbon
drinker
but
i
like
the
effect
the
aging
has
done
in
this
brew
decent
brown
ale
poured
this
amber
colored
ale
down
the
center
of
the
glass
and
got
very
little
head
at
all
and
what
tannish
foam
was
there
disappeared
quickly
in
a
strong
light
the
color
is
more
gold
than
amber
very
light
looking
as
is
the
mouthfeel
watery
but
a
little
something
there
with
the
distinct
bourbon
taste
in
the
beer
it
has
the
nutty
malty
flavor
of
a
brown
but
not
a
lot
there
slightly
astringent
and
maybe
a
little
diacetyl
butteriness
not
bad
and
the
taste
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
not
crazy
about
the
smellbourbon
in
an
old
sockbit
staleish
but
againnot
excessively
bad
in
any
wayjust
not
good
or
great
i
wish
i
had
traded
a
few
more
of
this
six
pack
for
other
beers
slainte
d
this
beer
was
unbalanced
and
could
have
been
much
better
certainly
not
bad
though
i
the
body
is
light
to
mid
feel
but
a
little
wispy
with
a
watery
finish
the
flavor
is
good
and
unique
i
will
have
to
take
revenge
and
trade
for
this
again
very
interesting
beer
it
pours
a
nice
brown
amber
with
a
nice
head
it
smells
of
jim
beam
primarily
with
brown
ale
grain
notes
the
taste
is
of
root
beer
cherry
candy
caramel
molasses
butterscotch
and
cola
very
complex
sort
of
hard
to
get
used
to
but
it
gets
better
as
you
drink
it
mouthfeel
is
good
and
velvety
drinkability
is
good
like
i
said
gets
easier
the
more
you
drink
it
great
idea
unusual
to
find
experiments
like
this
bottled
in
six
packs
this
poured
with
a
thin
lighttan
head
that
very
quickly
reduced
to
wispiness
color
was
a
clear
deepbrown
with
ruby
highlights
the
nose
was
maltysweet
with
undercurrents
of
bourbon
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
on
the
tongue
i
could
definitely
sense
the
bourbon
in
the
mouth
but
the
finish
was
unmistakably
bourbon
i
liked
the
taste
despite
not
being
a
distilled
spirits
drinker
i
would
drink
this
again
but
it
would
not
be
my
first
choice
warming
the
bourbon
presence
began
to
give
off
vanilla
notes
in
the
nose
and
then
became
even
more
evident
in
the
mouth
update

finishing
off
a
6
pack
this
is
a
nice
drinking
beer
the
bourbon
is
balanced
nicely
with
a
consistent
presence
that
is
not
too
much
or
overpowering
overall
an
interesting
brew
i
would
imagine
that
this
would
appeal
to
a
bourbon
drinker
d
this
beer
has
good
depth
nice
oaky
flavors
and
some
good
sweetness
also
uf
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
lots
of
fast
moving
carbonation
smooths
it
out
on
the
way
down
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
just
falls
off
a
bit
on
the
flavor
profile
for
me
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
personally
overall
a
unique
brown
ale
that
steps
outside
the
norm
a
bit
pours
dark
brown
and
clear
with
reddish
hues
in
the
light
initial
smells
are
sweet
vanilla
with
caramel
malts
a
peppery
alcohol
taste
is
up
front
with
some
wheat
bread
and
light
vanilla
flavors
as
well
fairly
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
little
tingle
from
the
alcohol
in
the
taste
fairly
drinkable
brown
bottle
from
bodega
in
la
crosse
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
good
lacing
throughout
aroma
of
bourbon
malt
and
nuts
medium
body
with
an
earthy
texture
and
the
bourbon
aging
is
apparent
throughout
malty
nutty
flavors
as
well
the
finish
is
nutty
also
with
a
light
alcohol
burn
left
behind
good
all
around
dark
brown
clear
body
head
rises
and
fades
befoe
i
take
a
sip
leaving
moderate
lacing
light
roasted
malt
and
some
bourbon
scents
are
evident
somewhat
woody
the
taste
is
very
interesting
the
bourbon
aging
is
obvious
something
that
is
usually
only
seen
in
larger
beers
and
different
styles
i
like
it
the
malt
plays
pretty
much
an
equal
role
as
the
bourbon
flavoring
giving
some
very
nice
beradiness
in
the
background
it
is
a
unique
beer
and
i
think
the
sum
of
its
parts
exceeds
the
individual
compontents
well
above
average
aroma
was
mostly
just
a
sweet
malty
affair
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
and
the
barest
whiff
of
wood
and
bourbon
light
brownred
in
color
with
a
thin
white
film
of
a
head
fore
is
low
intensity
sweet
malts
light
nuttiness
and
little
else
the
finish
is
all
watery
bourbon
and
wood
not
much
in
the
way
of
range
but
not
bad
tasting
and
i
usually
don¬ít
like
bourbon
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
i
would
say
drinkability
quite
good
higher
than
most
bourbon
beers
overall
first
of
all
id
like
to
thank
mlh1227
for
the
try
here
however
this
is
not
my
thing
im
not
overly
attracted
to
bourbon
flavors
the
coconut
was
a
hinderance
to
me
as
well
a
nice
try
as
i
always
enjoy
trying
something
new
but
i
cant
give
my
recommendation
tough
to
swallow
this
beer
pours
a
thick
ambergarnet
color
with
smallish
tan
head
but
good
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
pungent
and
delicious
like
a
cross
between
a
nut
brown
and
a
weeheavy
a
brilliant
mix
in
my
opinion
caramel
malts
bourbon
vapors
a
nutty
bite
some
floral
hoppiness
a
lovely
bouquet
mouthfeel
is
typical
of
an
american
brown
a
little
thin
but
substantial
enough
drinkable
to
no
end
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
without
a
doubt
another
solid
offering
from
tyranena
which
puts
out
some
surprisingly
good
stuff
interesting
enjoyable
and
not
overdone
with
bourbonbarrel
character
drinkability
its
pretty
good
and
different
than
your
typical
brown
but
not
that
good
a
very
solid
brown
ale
this
one
pours
out
to
a
dark
brown
in
the
glass
with
an
averagesized
head
the
aroma
is
of
a
light
malt
with
baking
bread
dough
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
taste
is
straightforward
brown
ale
with
roasted
malt
goodness
shining
through
this
one
isnt
a
chewy
brown
but
very
drinkable
this
could
be
a
session
brown
and
i
can
seen
the
fine
folks
of
wisconsin
doing
just
that
with
this
one
thanks
to
fantome
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
one
comments
¬ñ
thanks
to
buckeyenation
for
laying
this
one
on
me
only
my
second
brew
from
tyranena
i
am
impressed
so
far
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
light
tan
head
over
the
mostly
clear
reddish
brown
brew
frothy
head
hangs
around
nicely
and
lacing
is
very
nice
aroma
is
lightly
of
grains
but
more
or
less
too
sedate
for
me
here
taste
is
upfront
with
brown
malts
moving
into
some
fruitiness
and
a
bourbon
flavor
at
the
close
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
im
not
a
real
big
fan
of
the
extreme
browns
which
this
one
seems
to
almost
aspire
to
but
its
an
enjoyable
and
interesting
brew
for
sure
thanks
jeffboo
dark
copper
color
with
a
fizzy
head
the
aroma
is
malty
but
unremarkable
the
flavor
is
sweet
at
first
then
there
is
a
little
oak
flavor
but
not
many
bourbon
characteristics
aggresive
carbonation
is
a
little
annoying
on
the
tongue
pretty
good
drinkability
this
isnt
bad
but
here
are
a
ton
of
beers
similar
to
this
but
better
so
why
bother
chestnut
colored
liquid
capped
with
an
oatmeal
colored
lid
of
sea
foam
the
head
grips
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
slides
down
leaving
a
uniform
ring
around
the
inside
the
smell
is
very
faint
do
i
smell
bourbon
or
am
i
imagining
it
im
picking
up
some
sweet
malt
some
brown
sugar
and
molasses
but
i
have
to
try
hard
a
creamy
mouthfeel
leads
to
a
thinflavored
wash
of
syrupy
flavor
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
and
definite
bourbon
overtones
although
i
think
the
bourbon
detracts
it
doesnt
mesh
well
with
the
other
elements
and
leaves
a
sharp
and
bitter
aftertaste
with
a
metallic
linger
thanks
to
buckeyenation
for
sharing
but
as
i
glance
at
the
review
below
he
appears
as
enthralled
as
i
rockys
revenge
bourbon
brown
is
a
disappointment
but
thats
only
because
my
hopes
were
sky
high
its
still
good
beer
even
if
the
pint
of
bourbon
barrel
porter
that
i
had
at
my
local
rock
bottom
last
month
is
its
clear
superior
im
not
sorry
that
i
bought
a
sixer
but
no
tears
will
be
shed
once
ive
finished
the
last
one
interesting
but
not
overly
interesting
as
far
as
bourbon
aged
beers
go
this
could
have
used
more
malt
backbone
but
i
did
like
the
subtle
bourbon
flavor
perhaps
a
bit
too
subtle
but
the
levels
worked
for
this
brown
ale
just
enough
to
seep
into
the
palate
and
let
you
know
it¬ís
there
ive
had
this
a
few
times
and
it
just
gets
worse
and
worse
to
me
now
it
really
reminds
me
of
jack
and
coke
really
fake
sweet
and
really
really
whiskey
strong
the
recent
bottles
need
some
barrel
control
or
something
like
that
drinkability
has
to
rate
high
a
lower
weight
tasty
brown
ale
not
a
lot
of
brown
ales
better
than
this
one
except
the
full
blend
good
beer
a
good
beer
to
savor
drinkability
is
very
solid
sort
of
onedimensional
and
i
would
rather
see
the
whole
beer
barrelaged
rather
than
just
a
blend
but
its
a
very
pleasing
brown
ale
superb
cheers
mate
thanks
for
the
splash
of
bourbon
cokes
much
thanks
to
cokes
for
the
bottle
ive
tried
the
nonblended
version
and
its
a
bourbon
bomb
tasty
as
hell
but
more
of
a
spectacle
than
a
constant
drinker
this
one
shows
the
restraint
it
needs
to
fall
into
heavy
rotation
one
of
tyranenas
best
glad
to
hear
that
this
will
be
a
staple
in
their
lineup
and
not
just
a
seasonal
offering
miles
ahead
of
their
other
brown
ale
and
it
seems
that
the
key
here
is
only
parially
aging
this
in
bourbon
barrels
rather
than
doing
the
whole
thing
well
maintained
flavors
a
real
winner
this
is
a
bourbon
lovers
delight
although
hardly
a
substitute
for
a
good
bourbon
it
makes
a
delicious
beer
the
bourbon
flavor
is
prominent
upfront
in
addition
to
oak
in
which
the
brown
ale
aged
vanilla
and
caramel
emerge
in
the
midtones
just
a
touch
of
tabacco
toward
the
back
dry
oak
flavor
returns
this
finishes
with
a
burnt
brown
sugar
taste
this
is
a
very
nice
black
ale
malty
with
a
hint
of
tangy
hoppiness
along
with
a
taste
of
black
licorice
excellent
i
like
it
and
would
pick
up
another
sixer
its
a
wisconsin
brewery
i
like
to
support
local
brews
i
have
had
this
my
garage
for
over
a
year
i
loved
it
and
would
grab
it
again
if
given
the
chance
rescued
from
the
1
bin
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
into
a
pint
glass
not
a
huge
head
and
it
leaves
quickly
smells
of
malt
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
those
all
come
through
in
the
taste
but
with
more
of
a
roasted
flavor
medium
mouth
with
some
oil
i
really
like
this
and
would
revisit
it
regularly
smc
overall
a
very
drinkable
good
beer
pours
nicely
good
head
taste
as
a
sweet
with
complimenting
bitter
notes
pairs
well
with
asian
foods
dark
color
is
definitely
apparent
price
is
optimal
initial
taste
has
hints
of
spices
and
chocolate
with
slight
hints
of
caramel
dont
be
put
off
by
the
low
price
this
ale
is
done
right
its
not
the
finest
in
the
world
but
it
tastes
really
good
its
not
like
coming
home
to
a
warm
horny
loving
mate
but
its
a
good
kisser
like
your
lover
it
may
not
be
around
for
long
so
get
it
while
you
can
this
is
a
pretty
good
dark
roasted
malty
brown
ale
o
its
not
bad
but
there
just
isnt
much
to
report
here
acceptable
but
uninteresting
descent
beer
very
drinkable
nice
alternative
to
the
normally
heavy
dark
beers
decent
brew
they
deep
roasted
the
malt
until
it
got
that
burnt
edge
to
it
but
didnt
go
overboard
not
sure
how
many
i
could
have
but
decent
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
certainly
black
the
beer
had
a
fair
head
and
good
lacing
the
beer
smelled
pretty
much
like
a
guinness
with
its
taste
being
chewy
and
very
coffyish
with
a
bit
of
a
burnt
or
roasted
hit
not
burnt
in
a
bad
way
i
would
certainly
purchase
this
beer
again
pleasant
and
light
like
a
mild
or
a
mix
of
milk
stout
and
black
lager
colaish
with
a
touch
of
dark
caramel
and
a
little
chocolate
nougat
its
nice
but
nothing
more
than
that
possibly
a
good
partner
for
spicy
szechuan
thai
or
indian
food
very
malt
forward
with
good
roast
toasted
malt
and
chocolate
character
but
the
metallic
flavor
is
offputting
i
tried
the
2012
black
ale
as
soon
as
it
came
out
at
my
favorite
local
bar
it
had
a
smell
of
roasted
hops
that
was
very
pleasing
the
texture
of
the
beer
was
ok
while
the
taste
was
very
good
it
actually
reminded
me
of
a
stout
in
someways
due
to
its
color
aroma
and
the
taste
i
would
get
this
beer
again
as
long
as
they
continue
to
make
it
poured
into
pint
glass
appears
a
dark
cola
brown
with
no
head
whatsoever
the
nose
has
some
roasted
barley
notes
of
caramel
some
artificial
sweetener
and
tootsie
roll
chocolate
character
the
taste
has
a
heavy
bitter
roast
sweet
caramel
minimal
hops
something
is
odd
here
this
tastes
thin
and
artificial
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
fizzy
overall
this
one
needs
to
be
passed
on
overall
a
tasty
and
clean
brown
ale
this
isnt
too
bad
a
bit
more
pronounced
flavors
of
caramel
than
i
remember
not
a
bad
combination
of
sweet
and
toasted
allinall
a
really
nice
black
ale
plenty
of
soothing
malt
sweetness
abounds
not
overpowering
at
all
wellmade
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
great
brown
ale
its
nutty
and
very
malty
well
balanced
i
recommend
this
beer
it
pours
a
lovely
black
with
a
nice
head
that
dissipates
quickly
it
has
a
sweet
dark
smell
that
also
has
some
spices
the
taste
is
very
pleasing
and
the
beer
has
a
great
body
that
does
not
disappoint
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
is
a
nice
full
flavored
brown
ale
its
nutty
and
very
malty
with
a
very
balanced
hop
character
i
recommend
this
beer
to
all
fans
of
the
style
enjoyed

vanilla
roasted
caramel
and
ground
coffee
are
coming
in
on
my
palate
with
regards
to
the
smokiness
in
the
flavor
this
may
be
the
only
time
ive
been
able
to
appreciate
it
because
of
how
well
balanced
it
is
with
the
other
flavors
at
play
here
o
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
boasting
loads
of
flavour
in
an
unsuspecting
way
for
a
brown
ale
this
will
certainly
please
any
fan
of
the
style
o
not
a
very
memorable
brew
seemed
rather
typical
or
ordinary
dont
think
they
were
going
for
this
overall
a
good
surprise
candy
like
finish
nice
beer
it
looks
decent
in
the
glass
though
and
it
has
a
characteristic
for
the
style
if
mild
taste
and
aftertaste
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
but
it
was
worth
a
try
i
think
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
o
a
decent
little
beer
and
actually
a
nice
summer
beerlight
and
refreshing
and
in
a
can
which
is
nice
one
of
my
favorites
from
stevens
point
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling

kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
this
beer
pours
black

theres
a
thin

no

the
aroma
is
toast

and
a
hint
of

maple
and

shows
as
it

the
flavor
is
bread
crust
nuts
and
a
hint
of

with

candies
coming
through
as
it

you
have
really
creative
ideas
when
it
comes
to
marketing
your
products
but
your
actual
beers
come
off
as
disappointing
because
theres
little
to
no
flavor
at
all
im
pointing
this
out
in
particular
because
this
wouldve
been
an
absolutely
phenomenal
brown
ale
had
there
been
more
flavor
but
right
now
it
just
comes
off
as
a
good
idea
for
a
brown
ale
executed
poorly
overall
this
beer
is
smooth
enough
for
consecutive
drinking
yet
flavorful
enough
to
hold
your
interest
its
what
id
call
a
yummy
beer
though
i
drank
this
without
food
or
smoke
i
would
imagine
it
would
be
quite
good
with
a
steak
and
baked
potato
or
some
dryrub
barbeque
like
ribs
or
brisket
2012
is
good
enough
that
i
would
drink
it
again
and
good
enough
that
i
would
recommend
it
to
a
friend
especially
those
who
enjoy
nationally
distributed
brown
ales
like
newcastle
or

black
ale
is
pretty
smooth
drinking
and
very
mild
i
recently
had
a
few
pints
of
this
at
a
local
downtown
cigar
bar
they
didnt
have
any
stouts
on
tap
so
i
opted
for
this
at
their
only
darker
option
something
i
would
hope
would
hold
up
to
the
mild
cigar
i
was
having
it
didnt
pretty
decent
job
not
bad
but
not
clear
exactly
what
style
was
the
target
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
black
as
night
not
a
bit
of
color
in
this
one
the
head
is
a
chocolate
nice
solid
lacing
theres
just
a
slight
malt
scent
its
subtle
tempting
i
like
that
in
women
and
in
the
smell
of
my
malts
this
has
a
little
bit
of
a
chocolate
flavor
to
it
nice
smoky
wooden
taste
kicks
in
the
back
almost
porter
like
but
doesnt
quite
have
the
right
texture
to
it
this
is
a
perfect
winter
sipping
beer
23
of
these
is
probably
enough
it
might
be
the
best
thing
points
ever
done
expected
from
american
brown
ales
in
a
bolder
hop
presence
of
citrus
pine
andor
grass
but
those
lack
whereas
the
fairly
neutral
yeast
character
and
moderate
malt
dryness
come
through
nicely
if
not
timid
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
if
now
underwhelming
oeasy
to
drink
and
well
balanced
had
this
beer
on
tap
pretty
tasty
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
dark
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
tolerable
pours
a
pretty
decent
head
roasty
coffee
notes
with
a
clean
finish
it
was
good
enough
to
purchase
a
sixer
not
as
good
as
some
dark
beers
but
better
than
others
o
nice
beer
overall
not
overly
impressed
with
anything
but
this
is
a
good
beer
nice
overall
balance
of
flavors
cool
label
i
probably
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
though
also
they
say
the
beer
is
themed
on
the
mayan
calander
yet
an
aztec
calender
adorns
the
label
nice
sharp
carbonation
gives
this
black
ale
a
crisp
and
refreshing
feel
medium
bodies
and
flavorful
not
a
favorite
but
i
would
recommend
and
i
will
definitely
drink
this
one
again
o
very
pleasant
flavorful
beer
o
nice
beer
easy
drinker
nothing
dynamic
but
not
a
bad
offering
from
the
brewery
d
clean
and
refreshing
black
ale
taste
i
really
liked
this
had
great
roasted
malt
characteristics
and
the
flavor
stayed
consistent
sip
after
sip
low
abv
high
complexity
indeed
just
an
okay
beer
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
october
29
2011
the
pour
is
a
rich
black
with
a
thin
head
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
completely
blocked
from
light
like
a
stout
might
be
the
sweet
maltiness
kicks
in
on
the
nose
right
off
with
a
slight
cherry
cough
drop
mixture
the
overall
body
is
medium
but
there
is
also
a
kind
of
sticky
heavier
quality
to
it
the
taste
is
full
of
sweetness
and
molasses
it
is
a
likeable
beer
that
works
well
in
its
own
way
tastes
mild
with
some
lightly
roasted
malts
coming
through
i
get
a
little
burnt
cocoa
too
this
one
seems
simple
and
uncomplex
still
definitely
sessionworthy
despite
being
a
mite
thin
i
was
expecting
a
cascadian
ale
black
ipa
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
anyway
o
more
subtle
than
bold
this
is
a
wellcrafted
beer
worthy
of
attentive
consumption

black
ale
pours
a
black
stout
like
color
with
a
very
small
white
head
the
smell
was
malty
and
nutty
the
taste
was
full
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
nutty
flavor
very
typical
to
a
brown
ale
good
full
taste
no
watery
flavor
that
some
brown
ales
might
have
good
carbonation
overall
this
beer
delevers
on
the
most
important
factor
taste
different
for
a
brown
ale
in
other
catagories
but
a
good
beer
points
beers
seem
to
have
improved
a
lot
over
the
last
decade
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
one
tan
head
bubbles
up
nicely
on
the
pour
over
nearly
black
ale
as
advertised
a
very
light
mouthfeel
is
the
weak
point
of
the
beer
watery
base
has
a
light
roast
malt
but
not
overly
complex
or
interesting
more
coffee
than
roast

description
overall
a
serviceable
beer
for
the
night
and
a
standard
beer
for
stevens
point
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
black
brew
with
a
thin
head
showing
minor
traces
of
lacing
the
smell
is
of
a
rich
dark
roasted
malt
i
am
tasting
sweet
coffee
and
a
bit
of
pleasant
nut
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
pleasing
with
no
dryness
this
is
an
enjoyable
session
beer
that
i
would
happily
drink
again
would
i
buy
more
of
it
possibly
although
im
not
within
their
distribution
range
this
is
a
nice
beer
nothing
too
fancy
but
solid
if
you
like
dark
beers
with
a
lot
of
flavor
but
not
too
heavy
this
is
a
good
one
all
that
said
its
still
a
nice
refreshing
dark
alternative
on
a
hot
summer
night
thank
you
sir
but
you
can
keep
the
other
the
beer
is
light
in
body
lighter
than
it
looks
like
it
would
be
overall
a
good
alternative
to
the
lighter
summer
beers
dark
effective
with
portents
of
the
end
of
the
world
from
the
mayan
calendar
drink
up
the
end
is
near
overall
not
a
bad
beer
has
some
redeeming
qualities
but
not
something
i
would
probably
drink
to
much
of
im
naturally
drawn
to
dark
beers
stouts
and
schwarzbiers
and
the
like
so
i
figured
id
give
this
black
ale
a
try
it
was
more
of
a
dark
brown
ale
than
anything
i
thought
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
cola
brown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
mildly
roasty
aroma
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
bread
toasted
malts
in
the
taste
pumpernickel
and
hints
of
coffee
and
sugar
overall
pretty
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
really
a
bit
watered
down
just
barely
mediumbodied
and
hmm
probably
not
something
id
get
again
o
its
a
decent
beer
not
bad
but
also
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
wanted
to
try
it
i
did
i
can
say
i
gave
it
a
shot
and
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
do
very
nice
flavor
profile
for
something
so
low
in
abv
would
be
a
nice
one
around
a
campfire
on
a
cool
summer
night
but
again
twist
offs
in
craft
too
weird
rjt
o
sweet
malty
and
dark
but
wasnt
convinced
it
is
a
black
ale
the
mouth
is
adequate
with
sharp
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
black
beer
glad
to
see
it
added
to
points
lineup
its
ok
i
guess
if
you
like
burnt
malt
flavors
but
i
would
have
preferred
more
flavors
than
that
didnt
care
for
it
that
much
overall
this
was
an
ok
brew
i
really
dont
know
what
style
this
beer
fits
in
the
label
says
its
a
black
ale
ba
says
its
a
american
brown
ale
to
me
it
feels
like
a
combination
of
the
two
this
is
a
hard
beer
to
classify
but
in
the
end
it
went
down
smooth
and
easy
and
it
had
no
offensive
flavors
to
it
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
not
bad
for
my
first
stevens
point
brew
i
would
be
willing
to
see
what
else
they
got
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
brew
and
a
nice
warm
day
kind
of
brew
wonderful
beer
brownish
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
dissapates
quickly
smells
of
roasted
malts
tastes
of
malts
and
chocolate
mouthful
says
it
all
with
the
tastes
goes
down
smooth
and
tastes
of
an
excellent
black
ale
drinkablity
is
very
high
one
would
want
a
decent
six
pack
to
drink
with
his
buddies
o
a
decently
taste
black
ale
for
the
price
picked
it
up
just
because
the
name
was
impressive
but
its
just
a
bit
above
average
overall
glad
i
picked
this
single
up
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
full
flavors
might
consider
a
six
pack
but
would
love
more
cocoa
or
coffee
good
beer
call
it
brown
or
black
this
comes
across
as
a
light
porter
tasty
and
drinkable
from
a
brewer
ive
thought
of
as
on
par
with
saranac
for
being
merely
passable
dumb
name
for
a
beer
though
drinkability
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
a
decent
offering
from
a
brewery
whose
beers
i
have
found
to
be
just
adequate
id
buy
this
again
at
the
price
i
purchased
this
6pack
for
5

this
beer
officially

of
all
time
tasteblack
patent
malt
milk
chocolate
coffee
with
cream
supersmooth
and
creamy
very
nice

more
porterlike
than

very
tasty
and
drinkable
a
great
match
with
a
juicy
cheeseburger
or
spicy
tacos1
d
decent
drinkability
though
shallow
on
depth
and
substance
an
end
of
the
world
drink
hardly
better
then
most
of
their
offerings
dthe
slight
sweetness
and
lightness
makes
this
a
beer
one
could
drink
several
bottles
of
without
a
problem
the
body
is
light
but
brings
out
the
most
of
the
roasted
malts
along
with
caramel
and
hints
of
dark
fruits
there
isnt
a
lot
to
the
mouthfeel
but
its
pleasant
and
the
malts
are
too
cloying
ya
know
this
is
a
reasonable
flavorful
beer
nicely
hopped
over
a
mild
roast
body
id
drink
this
again
probably
try
to
find
a
way
to
flatten
it
some
additional
overall
it
could
be
a
pickup
for
a
six
pack
but
not
a
long
running
session
beer
best
beer
for
under
3
a
good
middle
of
the
road
beer
no
matter
what
its
called
average
brew
another
decent
point
offering
it
came
in
a
glass
from
tap
as
a
very
dark
beer
with
a
nice
head
and
a
very
appealing
look
it
had
a
very
nice
sweet
smell
and
had
great
substance
it
hit
the
mouth
with
a
nice
sweet
bite
and
went
down
very
nicely
the
depth
of
flavor
wasnt
as
deep
as
expected
and
was
the
only
thing
missing
from
this
beer
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
i
hope
to
drink
it
again
a
catchy
idea
from
point
but
point
should
have
just
brewed
a
stout
instead
of
a
stoutish
brown
ale
good
drinkability
but
the
d
train
lost
interest
half
way
through
figured
id
taste
the
apocalypse
before
it
tasted
me
though
i
didnt
expect
this
to
be
a
brown
ale
especially
considering
the
name
but
oh
well
it
pours
a
lightly
hazed
burnt
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
maple
syrup
light
cinnamon
and
light
molasses
if
it
werent
so
light
itd
be
more
enjoyable
the
taste
makes
these
elements
even
lighter
adding
a
touch
of
cola
to
the
proceedings
in
the
process
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thick
watery
feel
overall
a
decent
brew
nothing
special
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
either
for
a
normal
brown
though
its
not
too
bad
drinkability
this
is
a
soso
black
ale
that
wants
to
really
be
a
schwarzbier
easy
to
drink
but
it
grows
tiring
quickly
this
beer
says
black
ale
on
the
bottle
but
it
sure
as
hell
pours
a
brown
color
i
now
know
from
looking
at
this
site
its
a
brown
ale
but
honestly
youd
think
a
black
ale
should
be
a
schwartzbier
i
feel
lied
to
the
smell
has
a
lot
of
maple
syrup
going
on
in
it
perhaps
its
blending
with
some
toffee
notes
as
well
the
taste
is
more
along
the
lines
of
toffee
due
to
the
flavor
being
on
the
nutty
side
however
the
flavor
in
general
is
rather
weak
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
watery
to
the
point
that
its
hard
to
tell
this
is
actually
a
beer
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
good
there
is
nothing
offputting
enough
to
send
people
away
from
this
beer
but
overall
its
not
nearly
close
to
being
a
favorite
ill
pass
on
this
armageddon
ale
on
to
the
next
person
maybe
theyll
enjoy
it
more
than
i
pours
a
translucent
dirty
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
and
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
and
nutty
toffee
the
taste
upfront
is
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
and
nuts
faint
smokey
roasted
grain
notes
combine
with
an
astringent
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
flavor
doesnt
hold
together
very
well
its
watery
and
bland
with
just
a
slight
smokey
bitter
aftertaste
thin
watery
mouthfeel
as
well
not
awful
tasting
beer
but
not
good
either
my
buddy
got
me
a
six
pack
of
this
because
im
always
joking
about
the
comet
thats
coming
in
two
years
cool
concept
but
mediocre
brown
ale
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
caramel
and
a
hint
of
flowers
it
is
a
rather
strong
aroma
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
very
faint
there
is
some
light
caramel
but
not
much
else
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
with
a
watery
texture
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bland
beer
that
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
again
too
bad
the
taste
did
not
measure
up
the
flavor
was
not
unpleasant
but
weak
and
onedimensional
and
the
mouthfeel
rather
watery
not
bad
but
nothing
to
seek
out
okay
brown
ales
are
not
really
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
just
okay
whether
it
is
a
brown
ale
or
if
stevens
point
is
trying
to
be
creative
with
a
black
ale
style
it
really
does
not
wow
me
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
that
becomes
black
in
the
glass
with
one
finger
of
brown
head
with
good
retention
this
is
a
brown
ale
there
is
no
single
predominant
aroma
but
rather
a
three
way
tie
between
roastiness
walnuts
and
dark
chocolate
an
intriguing
nose
the
flavor
features
a
complex
interplay
of
the
aforementioned
elements
with
a
sweet
roastiness
lingering
on
the
finish
body
is
bit
lighter
than
i
would
like
but
overall
this
is
a
fascinating
brown
ale
that
would
probably
be
better
described
as
a
brownstout
hybrid
droomysternov
01
better
than
i
was
expecting
not
too
shabby
it
has
good
flavor
and
is
also
very
easy
going
down
it
can
be
very
slightly
watery
but
it
still
has
plenty
of
flavor
d
the
unpleasant
astringent
bitter
flavor
makes
this
beer
pretty
undrinkable
i
regret
that
i
have
5
more
from
the
six
pack
to
work
through
because
i
dont
think
that
i
would
drink
another
if
someone
offered
it
for
free
thin
mouthfeel
like
a
premium
american
lager
well
carbonated
overall
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
from
this
but
im
fairly
unimpressed
taste
smooth
carbonation
with
sweet
chocolate
and
some
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
in
the
finish
notes
reminds
me
of
a
schwarzbier
more
than
a
brown
ale
good
amount
of
chocolate
and
some
roasted
flavors
along
with
a
fair
amount
of
earthynutty
hops
didnt
wow
me
but
it
was
pretty
refreshing
and
an
easy
fairly
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
tan
head
smell
is
almost
entirely
dominated
by
roasted
malts
with
tiny
hop
notes
sneaking
in
here
and
there
definitely
more
toward
a
schwarzbier
in
the
nose
and
taste
profiles
taste
is
similar
with
roasted
malt
being
about
the
only
flavor
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
body
is
almost
entirely
lacking
drinkability
is
average
nothing
to
make
me
want
the
next
sip
d
something
about
it
seems
just
a
little
off
and
im
definitely
unsure
of
the
correlation
between
the
beer
and
the
2012
name
based
on
the
mayan
calendar
besides
the
inspiration
word
listed
on
the
bottle
i
do
however
remember
it
being
released
around
the
same
time
as
the
movie
under
the
same
name
marketing
ploy
for
sales
the
beer
is
average
this
stevens
point
offerings
name
was
inspired
by
the
mayan
longcount
calendar
that
suggests
that
the
world
will
end
on
december
21
2012
if
thats
true
then
you
can
be
sure
i
will
be
spending
my
final
days
drinking
something
more
worthy
of
the
apocalypse
than
2012
black
ale
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
15
inch
head
of
an
pale
tan
color
decent
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
grain
pale
malt
hops
and
a
hint
of
wheat
fits
the
style
of
an
american
brown
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
roasted
malt
slight
hop
pale
malt
slight
yeast
and
a
hint
of
citrus
ovearll
a
decent
brown
good
body
and
blend
saw
this
one
while
on
vacation
down
in
nashville
at
one
time
i
had
tried
every
beer
point
made
but
i
hadnt
seen
this
one
before
so
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
2012
is
black
in
the
glass
with
just
hints
of
rubybrown
at
its
edges
the
head
is
dense
and
creamy
mocha
in
color
and
leaves
nice
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
of
dark
chocolate
toasty
notes
a
bit
earthy
and
woody
the
flavor
has
similar
characteristics
nutty
roasty
chocolaty
and
earthy
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
creamy
carbonation
is
rather
docile
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
honestly
better
than
i
expected
theyre
better
than
bmc
beer
but
not
usually
impressive
this
one
is
probably
the
best
ive
had
by
them
yet
hell
of
a
deal
at
5
99
a
six
too
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
and
enjoy
all
year
round
not
just
during
the
fall
and
winter
months
when
darker
beers
tend
to
be
more
popular
i
tried
this
beer
at
the
magic
city
brewfest
then
stevens
point
2012
black
was
all
most
black
could
not
tell
about
the
head
because
it
was
on
a
2
oz
sample
it
smells
sweet
roasty
nutty
it
taste
sweet
nutty
and
ends
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
about
average
for
the
schwarzbier
style
not
bad
for
stevens
point
i
picked
up
a
single
at
princeton
liquors
the
near
black
beer
looked
more
like
a
schwarzbier
than
a
brown
ale
and
tasted
like
a
stronger
and
better
crafted
version
of
yuengling
porter
it
had
the
fruity
dark
chocolate
flavor
of
a
classic
baltic
porter
but
then
had
a
noticeably
thin
body
that
gave
away
the
quasicraft
origins
the
flavor
dropped
off
pretty
quickly
but
what
was
there
was
quite
pleasant
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
small
dark
tan
head
i
have
seen
porters
and
stouts
lighter
in
color
that
this
smell
is
a
hint
of
coffee
beans
and
dried
fruit
taste
is
dry
cocoa
powder
up
front
with
a
tart
malt
middle
and
an
earthy
grassy
finish
mouthfeel
is
average
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
rather
light
bodied
for
5
4
percent
alcohol
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
with
so
many
better
similar
beers
i
doubt
i
will
be
buying
this
again
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
red
highlights
and
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
with
some
chocolate
and
earthy
hops
notes
the
flavor
is
toffee
and
earthy
hops
with
not
too
much
else
going
on
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
a
very
exciting
beer
but
nothing
too
offensive
either
easy
to
drink
and
fairly
light
bodied
like
a
schwarzbier
hints
of
roast
malt
and
coffee
flaccid
and
husky
with
slight
diacetyl
not
particularly
complex
but
its
not
bad
could
drink
12
easily
overall
it
drinkability
is
about
average
the
aftertaste
does
not
leave
you
wanting
more
but
the
beer
is
worth
a
try
and
it
is
nice
to
see
this
long
time
brewery
pushing
its
limits
and
trying
new
styles
black
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading

aroma
is
very
faint
chocolate
taste
is
nuts
and
chocolate
malts
taste
is
kind
of
weak
and
watery
slightly
above
average
i
guess
i
would
recommend
to
try
at
least
once
im
5050
on
whether
i
would
purchase
again
this
ale
pours
black
with
a
moderate
but
quickly
diminishing
tan
head

a
little
lace
the
aroma

mild

found
in
the
swallow
d
i
could
see
drinking
a
six
pack
of
this
quite
easily
its
not
the
best
dark
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
decent
enough
and
would
do
well
for
someone
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
but
not
in
the
mood
for
the
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
crisp
and
full
of
flavor
just
a
little
thin
drinkability
easily
drinkable
and
approachable
and
fairly
reminiscent
of
the
schwarzbier
style
while
i
havent
had
a
slew
of
beers
from
stevens
point
brewery
this
has
been
one
of
the
better
ones
d
cant
see
this
as
a
session
beer
it
sits
a
little
heavy
in
the
stomach
overall
im
less
than
impressed
point
makes
some
decent
beers
usually
how
ever
this
one
missed
the
mark
for
me
this
was
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
point
and
worth
a
try
d
this
is
a
very
fine
dark
ale
it
really
seems
more
like
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
but
it
was
quite
good
either
way
pours
a
slightly
viscous
dark
brown
from
the
bottle
and
about
a
12
of
tan
head
arises
and
quickly
fades
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
in
the
flavor
i
get
quite
a
bit
of
roasty
coffee
and
slight
chocolatetoffee
notes
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
and
smooth
a
very
easydrinking
ale
i
like
overall
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
i
didnt
have
high
expectations
not
something
i
would
buy
again
just
didnt
have
it
going
on
not
to
drinkable
imo
aroma
is
malty
with
a
subtle
undertone
of
molasses
and
a
whisper
of
yeast
it
pours
a
nice
opaque
sable
with
a
fairly
thick
and
fluffy
beige
head
flavor
is
malty
and
a
little
sweet
having
a
hint
of
molasses
but
not
too
strong
texture
is
a
little
on
the
watery
side
and
just
a
little
fizzy
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
is
like
a
combination
of
light
and
dark
beers
with
reasonable
components
of
each
making
it
pleasant
refreshing
and
worth
a
trial
if
you
can
get
it
drinks
pretty
easy
not
on
point
for
the
style
but
close
enough
far
better
than
most
offerings
from
these
guys
i
look
as
this
a
pretty
solid
release
from
these
guys
worthy
of
future
purchases
when
hankering
for
some
coffee
licorice
flavor
especially
for
the
price
this
brew
was
a
deep
dark
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
nice
light
brown
2
finger
head
the
aroma
was
strong
of
roasted
malts
deep
chocolate
mild
coffee
and
some
subtle
nuttiness
the
taste
was
right
on
track
with
the
aroma
strong
roasted
malt
presence
with
coffee
and
chocolate
tones
there
was
a
wonderful
hop
balance
to
this
brew
and
the
thick
and
creamy
head
went
well
with
the
moderate
carbonation
this
was
a
tasty
treat
after
a
5
mile
run
very
surprised
with
this
brew
and
am
happy
to
have
it
brewed
in
my
backyard
this
beer
isnt
going
to
change
the
world
but
it
will
make
stevens
point
brewery
a
bit
more
diverse
i
think
this
beer
was
created
for
the
purpose
of
giving
us
point
beer
faithful
a
nice
sessionable
dark
ale
i
appreciate
what
point
is
doing
here
and
i
will
definitely
support
their
efforts
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
carbonation
kills
it
partly
toastynutty
aroma
taste
but
overall
a
strange
taste
complexion
just
doesnt
work
well
the
sharpness
of
the
carbonation
does
not
help
looks
nice
though
the
beer
does
not
taste
good
this
beer
would
have
received
a
higher
review
had
been
in
the
correct
category
as
per
a
brewery
rep
it
is
an
amber
ale
o
i
like
it
more
flavor
than
a
yards
brawler
with
more
flavor
impressive
for
a
3
5
brew
rating
to
style
yields
good
marks
for
this
brew
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
malty
bready
nutty
taste
is
the
same
lots
of
bready
malts
nutty
light
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
dark
brown
to
mohaghony
in
color
with
a
fingernail
of
off
white
head
light
brussels
lacing
aroma
is
comprised
of
dark
malt
and
isnt
very
strong
i
taste
dark
malt
with
a
slight
note
of
spice
similar
to
that
of
rye
im
thinking
that
is
the
flaked
maize
the
mouth
is
creamy
with
that
slight
spice
note
at
the
back
of
the
palate
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
slight
off
white
head
aroma
is
bready
nutty
and
roasty
giving
off
some
mild
chocolate
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
very
mild
grassiness
in
the
finish
a
creamy
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
not
a
fan
of
this
one
at
all
but
not
a
bad
beer
from
a
more
objective
perspective
to
me
this
beer
was
a
roastier
version
of
an
alt
while
also
reminding
me
way
too
much
of
new
belgiums
fat
tire
light
sessionable
brown
ale
with
a
malty
and
yeasty
flavor
finished
with
spicy
noble
hops
o
recommended
for
fans
of
brown
and
amber
ales
less
malty
but
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
fat
tire
o
man
this
is
a
great
sessionable
beer
lots
of
flavor
but
easy
to
drink
no
burn
and
pairs
well
with
most
foods
would
keep
this
around
all
thetime
if
it
were
available
rjt
overall
a
pretty
nice
easy
drinking
beer
there
is
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
but
enough
to
keep
a
very
light
beer
interesting
o
really
solid
brown
ale
i
am
shocked
the
the
amount
of
flavor
when
it
is
only
3
5
abv
really
packs
a
big
flavor
punch
for
low
abv
the
feel
was
also
deeply
influenced
by
the
high
carbonation
airy
and
expansive
the
bubbling
caused
a
small
bit
of
sharpness
in
the
throat
great
beer
year
round
recently
tipped
2
back
with
a
porterhouse
steak
phenomenal
the
way
the
perros
paired
with
the
porterhouse
definitely
worth
a
try
with
or
without
the
steak
this
yazoo
brew
will
always
do
seriously
though
this
beer
is
pretty
good
you
need
to
try
it
if
your
able
to
do
so
o
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
dont
overlook
it
because
its
not
an
imperial
this
or
a
tripel
that
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
everyone
should
try
o
i
really
like
this
beer
enjoyable
year
around
highly
recommend
this
beer
o
its
a
pretty
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
enough
to
keep
me
around
even
if
it
did
i
would
need
to
let
it
decarbonate
to
let
the
flavors
bloom
more
a
medium
brown
in
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
aromas
of
light
milk
chocolate
taste
is
quite
sweet
caramel
and
some
toasty
bread
a
hint
of
hops
to
balance
mouthfeel
is
amazingly
rich
overall
this
beer
is
remarkably
flavorful
for
a
mere
3
5
abv
i
would
certainly
get
this
again
after
seeing
some
of
the
higher
ratings
i
was
expecting
more
worthy
for
sure
but
for
me
that
is
as
high
as
i
see
this
one
o
this
one
surprised
me
the
look
just
had
me
a
bit
cautious
but
for
a
3
5
brown
this
is
very
drinkable
and
could
work
on
a
hot
or
a
cool
day
good
work
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
brown
in
color
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
beige
lacing
around
my
glass
it
gives
off
aromas
of
light
chocolate
malts
caramel
and
toffee
it
finishes
with
light
bitterness
you
can
definitely
tell
its
munich
dark
malt
all
are
very
light
and
well
integrated
it
tastes
of
light
chocolate
malt
and
again
is
very
heavy
on
the
munich
malts
it
it
lightly
bitter
and
subtly
sweet
it
tastes
like
a
less
nutty
altbairisch
it
drinks
very
light
and
is
as
refreshing
as
a
brown
ale
can
be
for
a
smaller
beer
it
has
solid
flavor
and
is
a
solid
choice
a
nice
malty
treat
that
you
could
enjoy
over
conversation
with
some
friends
had
on
tap
at
buscuit
and
blues
natchez
mo
pours
a
light
amber
brown
with
thick
foamy
head
into
mug
some
roasted
malts
and
slight
coffee
aromas
taste
is
crisp
lightly
roasted
malts
with
subtle
coffee
and
chocolate
some
bready
malt
finish
its
easy
drinker
especially
under
4abv
its
a
good
brew
not
amazing
but
the
best
onlycraft
brew
on
tap
here
but
i
did
get
a
second
this
has
a
bit
too
much
coffee
flavor
for
my
personal
taste
but
its
easy
to
drink
with
a
great
mouthfeel
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
of
them
quite
a
few
more
and
some
limes
poured
from
the
bottle
this
ale
was
a
thin
brown
color
with
an
half
inch
head
any
head
quickly
disappeared
to
leave
trace
patterns
of
foam
on
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
particularly
bold
for
a
brown
ale
as
the
malt
was
an
attention
grabber
the
taste
was
watery
up
front
before
growing
progressively
maltier
notes
of
chocolate
and
corn
were
hidden
among
the
malt
selections
in
the
aftertaste
a
mild
citrus
hop
note
is
detectable
among
the
malts
because
this
ale
is
a
little
thicker
than
most
brown
ales
the
aftertaste
is
allowed
to
linger
a
little
longer
than
usual
overall
this
is
an
above
average
brown
ale
o
like
i
stated
before
this
wont
please
everyone
but
i
tip
my
hat
to
yazoo
for
making
a
dos
equisstyle
brew
that
is
at
least
twice
as
good
as
the
aforementioned
brewski
it
was
okay
not
my
particular
favorite
and
not
on
par
with
some
of
the
other
brews
from
yazoo
o
a
flavorful
brown
ale
that
is
very
drinkable
overall
very
interesting
beer
in
its
concept
i
just
wish
it
could
dome
out
a
little
more
in
the
taste
appearance
looks
much
like
iced
tea
dark
brown
and
transparent
around
the
edges
with
a
small
quickfading
head
malt
and
floral
scents
are
weak
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
bready
and
a
bit
herbal
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
not
bad
but
not
great
either
o
overall
a
nice
session
beer
and
a
nice
brown
ale
i
liked
this
one
much
more
then
their
pale
ale
the
nose
and
taste
are
a
nice
mix
of
nuts
roasted
malts
and
caramel
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
with
the
smooth
body
and
very
low
abv
worth
checking
out
and
would
have
it
again
o
little
thin
for
my
liking
but
it
has
a
nice
easy
drinking
flavor
could
absolutely
have
a
few
of
these
sitting
around
good
not
great
but
well
worth
a
buy
palate
is
bubbly
and
dry
but
super
sessionable
wish
they
had
this
on
tap
by
me
in
il
othis
is
okay
really
doesnt
seem
like
a
brown
ale
i
would
not
mind
trying
this
again
to
see
of
the
tartness
was
a
bad
or
out
dated
bottle
maybe
10
months
old
is
too
old
overall
a
solid
session
beer
this
is
a
real
thirst
quenching
beer
its
mild
and
enjoyable
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
be
happy
however
the
flavor
isnt
strong
enough
to
be
a
really
good
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
on
a
trip
to
nashville
how
can
you
not
get
some
yazoo
this
poured
a
serious
dark
auburn
light
white
foam
head
that
had
mostly
faded
by
the
time
it
got
to
me
the
aroma
was
a
nice
combo
of
sweet
malt
and
a
touch
of
roast
with
some
corn
in
there
too
but
it
works
the
taste
was
super
sweet
but
had
almost
a
faint
smokiness
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
was
akin
to
boston
lager
and
overall
thats
the
beer
it
most
reminded
me
of
though
it
was
a
half
step
above
overall
good
and
clearly
a
brewery
that
nashville
is
proud
of
and
from
what
ive
tasted
it
seems
appropriate
p
great
affinity
for
texmex
and
bbq
d
a
definite
session
beer
very
nice
from
the
bottle
but
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
light
roast
and
more
caramel
tones
i
get
a
little
coffee
too
finishes
with
a
slightly
acidic
citrus
hop
zest
somehow
this
one
seems
a
little
offbalance
i
get
too
much
sweet
and
tartness
not
one
id
pursue
again
overall
impression
this
is
one
of
my
first
drain
pours
of
the
fall
for
some
reason
there
was
such
a
great
aroma
but
nothing
in
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
like
water
with
a
bit
of
sugar
and
hop
added
may
need
to
try
this
again
to
see
if
the
bottled
date
was
too
long
ago
o
a
nice
yazoo
offering
and
one
of
their
staples
nice
out
of
the
bottle
but
better
on
tap
overall
impression
not
too
shabby
to
its
credit
dos
perros
does
open
up
well
and
the
carbonation
is
tamed
some
worth
a
shot
id
drink
it
from
time
to
time
if
yazoo
were
in
ohio
ok
at
best
okay
not
really
pretty
mediocre
as
there
are
some
odd
notes
that
just
dont
do
it
for
me
here
really
a
interesting
beer
and
it
drinks
bigger
than
its
supposed
3
5
abv
overall
this
is
a
frequent
goto
for
me
i
highly
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
if
youre
in
tennessee
or
northmid
alabama
the
mouthfeel
of
dos
perros
is
both
smooth
and
crisp
and
just
like
the
taste
there
is
no
syrupy
or
processed
mouthfeel
that
is
left
because
of
the
good
malt
nature
of
the
beer
the
offering
is
rather
crisp
in
nature
and
all
told
is
a
nice
balance
of
complexity
in
terms
of
drinkability
the
dos
perros
could
be
a
very
nice
session
beer
as
the
abv
is
a
low
3
5
and
when
coupled
with
the
smoothness
and
crisp
nature
of
the
beer
you
are
left
with
a
good
tasting
beer
that
is
sure
to
not
let
you
down
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
pepsi
brown
in
color
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
beige
lacing
around
my
glass
it
gives
off
aromas
of
light
chocolate
malts
caramel
and
toffee
it
finishes
with
light
bitterness
you
can
definitely
tell
its
munich
dark
malt
all
are
very
light
and
well
integrated
it
tastes
of
light
chocolate
malt
and
again
is
very
heavy
on
the
munich
malts
it
it
lightly
bitter
and
subtly
sweet
it
tastes
like
a
less
nutty
altbairisch
it
drinks
very
light
and
is
as
refreshing
as
a
brown
ale
can
be
for
a
smaller
beer
it
has
solid
flavor
and
is
a
solid
choice
overall
impression
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
and
it
was
definitely
different
the
aroma
left
evidence
of
a
flavorful
beer
but
the
abv
indicated
that
it
was
a
session
beer
it
was
very
drinkable
and
it
had
a
little
more
flavor
than
most
session
beers
however
i
felt
that
the
light
flavors
were
a
bit
of
a
tease
and
it
felt
a
bit
watered
down
in
the
follow
through
im
not
opposed
to
light
session
beers
but
the
lighter
flavors
left
me
wanting
something
a
bit
more
bold
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
smallish
tightly
bubbled
khaki
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
on
top
smells
of
caramel
brown
bread
applesauce
brown
sugar
theres
more
in
the
nose
than
i
was
expecting
taste
is
light
and
sweet
malts
with
a
hint
of
tart
and
astringency
watered
down
brown
sugar
water
with
hints
of
fruit
and
bread
kind
sums
up
this
experience
thinnish
body
medium
to
high
level
of
carbonation
watery
prickly
mouthfeel
this
smelled
a
whole
lot
better
than
it
tasted
average
beer
at
best
got
this
in
a
trade
it
pours
a
nice
dark
cola
brown
with
a
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
malty
aroma
has
a
fruity
undertone
and
a
hint
of
caramel
and
is
very
inviting
mouthfilling
flavor
is
this
beers
strongest
point
rich
and
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
brown
sugar
and
apple
and
just
a
whisper
of
banana
texture
is
smooth
but
lacking
in
fizz
overall
this
is
a
truly
worthy
ale
if
ever
you
are
in
nashville
look
for
this
one
and
its
siblings
a
lovely
session
brown
from
yazoo
id
never
guess
the
abv
was
so
low
from
the
taste
but
really
appreciate
that
i
can
have
a
decent
beer
without
worrying
about
a
buzz
the
flavor
is
a
simple
and
balanced
bready
and
nutty
caramel
sort
of
a
like
a
cleaned
up
newcastle
theres
a
pleasant
little
kick
of
toffee
and
the
end
and
the
beer
finished
slightly
sweet
without
the
lime
dos
perros
is
very
drinkable
a
good
option
for
filling
your
growler
and
a
great
place
to
start
sampling
yazoos
lineup
of
standard
styles
before
moving
on
to
some
of
their
more
adventurous
varieties
from
the
sampler
flight
at
the
brewery
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
that
has
descent
retention
and
soapy
lace
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
malt
a
touch
of
roast
coffee
notes
and
light
earthy
hops
in
the
back
the
taste
follows
with
some
dark
fruit
hidden
under
chocolat
and
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
spicy
earthy
hops
a
bit
watery
but
it
is
a
low
gravity
beer
lots
of
flavor
for
such
a
light
bodied
but
dark
beer
easy
to
drink
a
staple
beer
for
anyone
living
in
middle
tennessee
dos
perros
is
a
good
beer
which
presented
with
very
little
head
often
this
beer
is
sered
too
cold
as
it
was
last
night
at
the
palm
restaurant
in
downtown
nashville
order
it
and
let
it
sit
a
little
and
as
it
warms
is
choclate
notes
are
more
evident
and
it
tastes
better
an
area
this
beer
could
be
better
is
mouthfeel
a
little
too
much
carbonation
at
times
try
it
if
you
get
a
chance
one
of
my
favorite
yazoo
beers
dvery
drinkable
taste
was
gone
in
no
time
very
respectable
that
i
didnt
expect
pours
an
orangish
brown
with
a
bit
of
white
head
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
sweet
and
roasty
lots
of
malts
on
the
nose
and
a
nice
roasted
smell
tastes
pretty
sweet
and
malty
there
is
a
nice
roast
across
it
that
blends
well
with
the
malt
profile
a
bit
sharp
on
the
tongue
due
to
high
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
but
at
3
5
percent
i
would
hope
so
traders
note
many
thanks
to
curtismcarthur
for
the
fresh
bottle
very
easy
to
drink
very
light
overall
with
a
clean
finish
sessionable
good
wouldnt
turn
it
down
wouldnt
buy
an
entire
6
pack
of
it
either
paying
homage
to
the
mexicanvienna
beers
enough
head
to
get
by
clear
reddish
brown
color
smells
of
german
dark
bread
subtle
floral
hops
and
cocoa
powder
this
ale
has
some
body
for
a
smaller
beer
but
still
leans
toward
the
dry
side
milklike
sweetness
form
the
maize
adds
some
depth
to
the
clean
toasty
maltiness
light
peck
of
hop
spice
and
floral
bitterness
level
this
beer
out
of
course
we
have
to
use
session
beer
somewhere
in
this
reviewa
damn
good
one
at
that
carbonation
is
medium
with
a
medium
light
body
the
lighter
body
really
adds
to
the
drinkability
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
several
times
and
just
wish
some
of
the
coffee
noted
wouild
transfer
to
the
taste
d
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
its
nothing
special
at
all
and
i
can
respect
that
as
just
a
easy
drinking
brown
ale
abv
is
low
that
you
can
make
this
a
nice
session
beer
not
bad
from
a
company
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
in
the
future
after
drinking
this
beer
id
like
to
try
more
of
yazoos
beers
especially
their
irish
stout
and
apa
drinkability
is
high
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
a
very
good
representative
of
the
style
either
the
taste
is
ok
sweet
darkened
caramel
flavor
that
seems
to
be
a
little
washed
out
by
the
watery
body
and
light
carbonation
the
finish
is
ok
but
leaves
me
wondering
where
the
beer
went
beer
is
thin
and
has
an
odd
late
bitterness
aftertaste
that
tastes
like
wheat
and
roasted
grains
there
is
little
in
the
forward
palate
and
its
not
a
very
desirable
beer
this
is
my
favorite
regular
offering
from
yazoo
im
eating
3
meat
spicy
spaghetti
and
this
beer
is
going
down
great
a
great
big
food
beer
i
love
yazoo
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
beer
that
i
havent
liked
from
them
not
too
too
bad
but
nothing
really
to
write
home
about
the
appearance
is
light
and
transparent
with
a
brownish
color
and
thin
off
white
foam
head
the
aroma
is
somewhat
nutty
and
malty
but
nothing
too
big
sticks
out
has
good
carbonation
the
flavors
were
very
distinguishable
overall
im
impressed
nice
surprise
at
the
flying
saucer
in
memphis
tn
poured
a
cloudy
chestnut
brown
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
head
and
good
retention
smelled
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
certainly
revealed
a
nice
malty
carameltoffee
balance
dissolving
to
a
modestly
sweet
finish
thinner
than
it
looks
with
modest
carbonation
but
definitely
sessionable
drinkability
fantastic
agreeably
flavorful
easy
on
the
alcohol
beautifully
balanced
tasty
and
moreish
underrated
gem
from
yazoo
in
my
homer
opinion
dark
copperybrown
in
color
smells
richly
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
taste
is
milk
chocolate
light
hops
and
considerable
roasted
malt
mediumbodied
good
drinkability
quite
tasty
d
easy
to
drink
not
too
light
bitter
aftertaste
that
dissapates
quickly
d
fantastic
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
taste
is
really
enjoyable
but
not
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
sweet
chocolate
malt
is
a
definite
highlight
here
but
there
is
just
a
hint
too
much
hoppiness
in
this
one
for
my
liking
but
not
enough
to
tip
the
scales
too
far
overall
this
beer
has
a
nice
sugaryness
to
it
medium
body
very
smooth
and
a
pretty
good
drink
just
doesnt
finish
as
nice
a
little
bitter
overall
i
loved
this
beer
i
havent
had
much
form
yazoo
but
this
is
one
beer
that
has
me
loving
the
brewery
so
far
i
found
this
be
an
exceptional
brown
ale
my
favorite
of
the
type
i
would
venture
to
say
at
this
point
in
my
life
actually
everyone
must
try
this
beer
now
this
a
different
take
on
an
american
brown
aleand
i
kinda
like
it
poured
a
deep
tawny
brown
with
a
thinner
white
head
atopdeep
roast
in
the
nosealong
with
some
brown
sugar
and
a
mineral
scent
flavors
are
roasted
with
some
bitter
chocolate
nut
and
earth
round
out
a
soft
finish
that
the
flaked
maize
had
a
hand
in
i
am
guessing
hmm
i
had
low
expectationsbut
i
gotta
say
it
has
a
uniquness
thats
pretty
good
clear
reddish
brown
in
color
with
steady
carbonation
and
medium
head
that
slowly
fizzes
to
a
ring
leaving
spots
of
lacing
down
the
glass
really
like
the
smell
toasted
malts
chocolate
toffee
lightly
sweet
and
bready
even
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
the
taste
is
less
explosive
than
the
nose
still
a
nice
toasted
flavor
with
bread
not
as
much
chocolate
and
a
tad
more
sweetness
to

out
of
nashville
i
should
the
good
lord
willing
have
no
trouble
clearing
through
the
remainder
of
the
sixpack
now
for
the
bad
news
its
so
overly
priced
i
cannot
see
how
they
can
sell
it
there
are
better
beers
for
a
much
more
affordable
price
a
good
but
average
brown
from
the
folks
at
yazoo
pours
dark
brown
with
an
redish
tint
and
very
little
head
what
there
is
is
a
thin
swirl
that
eventually
disappears
completely
smells
earthy
a
bit
roasty
and
a
touch
of
piney
hops
the
taste
is
sweeter
and
exhibits
some
cookie
like
malt
and
a
touch
of
adjunct
sweetness
with
some
fruity
flavors
up
front
as
well
it
drys
out
a
bit
toward
the
end
and
becomes
roastier
and
earthier
pretty
light
overall
but
nicely
flavorful
for
the
low
abv
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
although
its
a
bit
club
soda
like
in
body
right
at
the
beginning
a
nice
session
option
easy
drinker
and
one
that
brown
ale
fans
should
give
a
try
if
you
can
find
some
check
it
out
pours
a
nice
light
brown
clear
with
reddishruby
highlights
a
white
head
sits
on
top
kind
of
thick
at
least
2cms
which
stays
around
leaving
nice
lacing
and
sending
a
nice
stream
of
bubbles
through
the
beer
looks
good
very
good
it
smells
like
sweet
caramel
a
bit
like
cola
with
some
light
hints
of
milk
chocolate
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
which
is
kind
of
normal
but
out
of
the
ordinary
as
far
as
american
styles
go
and
i
can
also
smell
a
bit
of
yeast
mixing
with
the
malts
to
make
a
very
bready
kind
of
smell
something
smells
almost
raw
like
unfermented
wort
the
taste
delivers
mostly
on
the
cola
nots
like
a
less
sharply
carbonated
cocacola
theres
also
a
hint
of
creaminess
a
tiny
bit
of
spice
from
the
hops
i
suppose
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
it
actually
tastes
a
bit
like
root
beer
as
well
with
very
low
bitterness
no
leafiness
just
a
hint
of
earthiness
is
all
actually
i
would
like
just
a
little
more
no
bitterness
not
much
with
dry
hops
but
just
a
little
earthiness
or
maybe
some
herbal
flavors
to
balance
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
almost
not
complex
enough
but
still
very
nice
the
body
is
kind
of
medium
maybe
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
knowing
the
abv
that
isnt
surprising
the
carbonation
is
mild
as
well
no
sting
just
a
tiny
sharp
presence
on
the
tongue
there
are
a
few
thing
that
could
add
some
body
and
complexity
without
losing
the
character
of
the
beer
maybe
replacing
some
of
the
lighter
malt
with
some
roasted
malts
maybe
adding
a
little
bit
more
hops
towards
the
end
of
the
boil
but
still
its
better
than
the
average
brown
ale
by
all
means
this
is
actually
a
perfect
sort
of
session
brown
ale
i
would
probably
go
to
it
if
i
wanted
to
drink
one
thing
for
quite
a
while
its
very
pleasant
sort
of
inoffensive
and
you
could
definitely
do
worse
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
this
is
a
beer
you
should
take
a
shot
at
if
you
can
d
this
ale
was
quite
different
in
bottle
than
it
was
on
tap
previous
review
i
still
liked
it
though
and
consider
it
to
be
extremely
drinkable
and
sessionable
d
pretty
good
easy
drinking
drinkability
a
highly
sessionable
beer
with
lots
of
great
malty
flavor
nicely
attenuated
a
good
brew
poured
a
standard
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
nose
has
a
malty
aroma
and
tad
but
hoppy
but
no
nuts
or
anything
like
you
would
expect
from
a
brown
taste
is
a
little
weak
for
a
brown
not
much
going
on
and
this
could
be
due
to
a
low
abv
but
still
good
well
balanced
with
the
hops
and
malts
easy
to
drink
while
on
a
recent
visit
to
nashville
i
picked
up
a
6er
of
this
at
a
local
gas
station
for
a
very
reasonable
price
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
nice
deep
yet
clear
brown
color
with
a
thin
effervescent
brown
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
smell
is
malt
dominant
with
lightly
toasted
notes
chocolate
and
caramel
the
taste
reflects
the
same
maltiness
carefully
balanced
with
a
light
citrus
hopping
still
slightly
sweet
but
not
sickeningly
so
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
chewy
carbonation
and
goes
down
very
smooth
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
im
glad
i
picked
this
sixer
up
sad
i
didnt
visit
the
brewery
while
i
was
there
malt
and
toasty
aromas
hops
aroma
is
present
but
not
overpowering
dark
malt
character
is
robust
light
tan
head
and
nice
dark
brown
color
medium
malt
flavors
with
some
hop
bitterness
but
its
very
light
had
a
good
aftertast
that
was
malty
sweet
but
didnt
linger
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
ive
had
this
in
bottle
and
on
tap
at
the
brewery
wow
i
will
admit
my
beer
drinking
brethren
that
i
have
strayed
from
the
path
ive
been
enjoying
wine
quite
a
bit
lately
im
not
sure
if
it
was
a
skunked
bass
or
that
milwaukees
best
ice
that
gave
me
the
desire
for
a
change
of
scenery
but
this
one
sure
brought
me
back
had
it
at
rose
peppers
in
nashville
on
tap
came
in
a
pitcher
great
head
when
poured
into
my
frosty
mug
and
great
color
somewhere
between
a
stout
and
a
nut
brown
in
color
head
is
a
nice
creamy
off
white
with
streaks
of
brown
the
aroma
is
where
this
one
got
me
im
not
one
for
that
charred
over
the
top
roasted
malt
that
ive
have
found
in
some
beers
of
this
style
this
one
was
sweet
and
malty
with
just
enough
roasted
character
and
citruslike
hops
to
balance
it
out
and
the
flavor
was
spot
on
this
is
my
first
yazoo
and
damn
am
i
happy
to
be
so
close
to
nashville
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
not
my
favorite
not
one
ill
seek
again
but
i
will
be
trying
their
other
offerings
another
yazoo
beer
in
a
recent
beer
trade
with
fsvan
pours
wonderfully
into
my
sam
adams
sensory
glass
i
love
to
smell
beers
and
this
one
has
a
distinctive
smell
maybe
chocolate
or
coffee
but
theres
definitely
something
here
for
the
nose
to
enjoy
this
might
be
even
better
than
yazoos
hefe
which
i
reviewed
previously
if
possible
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
even
better
than
the
smell
not
thin
like
a
lot
of
brown
ales
sweetwater
in
particular
i
really
like
this
sampling
of
yazoo
dos
perros
and
would
definitely
look
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
in
the
near
future
nice
dark
color
hinted
at
what
was
to
come
distinct
chocolate
aroma
i
enjoyed
the
slight
creaminess
of
this
one
could
taste
a
chocolate
or
even
hints
of
coffee
as
it
finished
nice
full
flavored
yet
not
overly
sweet
which
i
like
overall
very
balanced
and
drinkable
and
exceptionally
clean
quite
a
wellcrafted
and
rather
distinctive
brown
d
not
a
bad
drinkability
this
is
probably
an
underrated
beer
but
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
to
support
another
fairly
local
southern
brewery
a
nice
but
not
spectacular
brown
ale
pours
a
somewhat
dark
brown
colored
body
with
an
offwhite
head
an
aroma
of
nuttiness
lagerness
pilsnerlike
chocolaty
smelling
somewhat
creamy
but
mostly
watery

my

to
me
from

chocolate

almost
no

some

is
present
but
not
overwhelming
with
a

and
a

bitterness
just
balances
the
sweetness
no
real
hop
character
just
a
little

in
the
background
body
is
light
for
a
5
5
beer
clean
dry
finish
with
a
slight
lingering
bit
of
malt
decent
brown
color
a
little
light
though
a
bit
of
initial
head
and
almost
no
lacing
very
sweet
scent
a
bit
of
malt
and
a
little
cocoa
and
maybe
rice
adjunct
flavor
hints
of
rice
or
corn
with
the
usual
barley
although
the
taste
is
fine
if
very
sweet
from
this
some
hints
of
a
deep
flavor
in
there
if
they
could
pull
it
out
goes
down
fine
actually
fairly
smooth
very
good
beer
ive
had
it
both
draft
and
from
a
bottle
i
live
in
ind
and
its
not
available
where
i
live
but
my
son
brings
it
home
from
nashville
on
the
holidays
i
have
yet
to
get
a
bad
reaction
from
anyone
that
ive
provided
the
beer
too
excellent
session
beer
light
and
refreshing
ps
the
side
label
goes
to
some
lengths
to
describe
how
many
mexican
beer
styles
descend
from
old
austrian
styles
citing
the
late
1800s
austrian
rule
over
mexico
a
fact
i
did
not
know
quite
frankly
for
such
influence
i
bring
this
point
up
because
the
american
brown
ale
designation
seems
incorrect
not
sure
where
these
two
dogs
should
lie
but
brown
ale
this
is
a
dark
brown
beer
with
a
decent
head
and
a
mildly
malty
aroma
it
is
nice
and
refreshing
with
a
well
carbonated
but
light
mouthfeel
the
malt
is
slightly
toasted
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
that
settles
into
a
subtle
hoppiness
not
a
bad
beer
for
an
afternoon
break
solid
example
of
the
style
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
red
an
interesting
take
on
an
austrianmexican
hybrid
style
beer
a
guinnessesque
aroma
the
taste
has
bits
of
coffee
and
chocolate
latter
is
more
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
again
always
a
pleasure
to
support
the
local
brewery
d
lets
seeits
got
a
light
body
subtle
flavor
and
low
abv
this
is
definitely
a
sessionable
brown
ale
maybe
not
the
best
choice
if
youre
looking
for
an
absolute
flavor
bomb
but
thats
not
what
its
trying
to
be
i
prefer
to
session
with
hoppier
beers
but
ill
definitely
be
bringing
some
of
this
to
my
brownale
obsessed
father
dark
newcastle
brown
with
a
small
white
head
aromas
of
dark
malt
bread
a
bit
of
coffeechocolate
and
some
faint
hops
taste
follows
suit
and
is
non
confrontational
with
a
nice
caramel
breadlike
maltiness
and
subtle
hopping
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
drinkaiblity
is
nice
as
well
a
perfect
bottle
to
chug
on
a
hot
nashville
afternoon
drinkability
is
ok
i
would
order
a
few
of
these
at
a
bar
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
from
this
one
considering
the
writing
on
the
label
said
it
was
a
mexican
style
to
me
it
was
a
good
nut
brown
rather
drinkable
its
pretty
good
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
to
drink
pours
an
amber
that
borders
on
brown
i
taste
strong
carmel
and
toffie
malts
and
a
light
hop
presance
that
kickes
in
in
the
very
last
moment
their
is
also
a
sour
presance
in
the
middle
of
this
beer
all
the
flavors
work
well
with
outher
this
is
an
avrage
beer
that
i
would
drink
agan
if
it
crossed
my
path
this
is
worth
a
shot
thanks
jed
d
very
drinkable
and
a
decent
albeit
nondescript
offering
the
flavor
matched
the
aroma
well
something
i
like
to
see
with
brown
ales
notes
of
sweet
molasses
and
caramelized
bread
hit
first
while
a
slight
chocolateroasted
nuttiness
finished
off
the
taste
mouthfeel
was
a
little
lighter
bodied
than
i
would
have
liked
with
a
slightly
lower
than
expected
carbonation
level
still
this
was
an
excellent
brown
ale
and
one
ill
surely
be
looking
to
try
again
this
was
a
good
beer
it
is
nicely
balanced
achieves
a
good
blend
of
malt
and
hops
give
this
beer
a
try
d
pretty
drinkable
i
would
have
had
another
pint
but
i
had
to
sample
some
more
of
what
the
j
clyde
had
to
offer
very
nice
and
makes
me
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
yazoo
md
medium
bodied
and
very
crisp
carbonation
easy
drinking
beer
d
very
good
drinkability
refreshing
and
flavorful
this
was
the
third
of
three
yazoo
beers
that
hollyann
brought
back
from
nashville
and
i
liked
every
one
of
them
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
that
should
be
served
in
my
humble
opinion
more
like
a
british
beer
slightly
below
room
temp
for
best
results
a
nice
tasty
that
i
will
have
again
the
next
visit
to
tn
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
carbonation
was
mild
pretty
drinkable
especially
since
browns
are
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
i
do
know
that
the
owner
is
slowly
trying
to
get
yazoo
beers
distributed
to
a
wider
area
as
long
as
it
is
presented
well
enough
d
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
one
too
much
o
it
is
a
very
solid
beer
another
good
choice
from
yazoo
with
plenty
of
flavor
to
make
it
worth
a
try
this
is
a
nicely
made
beer
with
balanced
hops
and
malt
it
was
not
quite
up
to
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
would
definitely
not
turn
down
another
mouthfeel
redeems
it
some
its
got
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
chewyness
to
it
but
a
little
thin
overall
not
my
favorite
brew
ever
too
sweet
and
not
enough
dimension
in
the
flavor
department
but
i
can
see
it
going
well
with
certain
food
styles
not
a
bad
beer
d
decent
session
beer
id
be
curious
to
try
it
with
a
spicy
mexican
dish
excellent
session
beer
here
not
too
strong
but
very
tasty
and
easy
going
down
the
label
doesnt
mention
a
style
but
does
claim
its
roots
in
austrianinspired
mexican
beers
despite
being
fermented
as
an
ale
this
is
a
european
amber
lager
by
recipe
not
an
american
brown
its
got
the
color
of
a
maerzen
with
greater
bitterness
and
hop
aroma
of
a
vienna
style
this
arrived
with
a
notbig
head
but
a
really
thick
one
with
a
beautiful
mochabrown
color
and
evidencing
lots
of
co2
bubbles
the
color
was
a
deep
colacolored
amber
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
was
light
tending
towards
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
light
malty
sweetness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
very
smoooth
with
the
same
malty
sweetness
that
i
noted
on
the
tongue
continuing
to
linger
i
would
mark
this
one
down
as
a
session
beer
notes
my
wife
loves
all
the
beers
from
this
brewery
enjoyed
at
buffalo
billiards
downtown
nashville
the
beer
stood
out
immediately
at
an
american
brown
ale
without
knowing
the
style
the
beer
opens
with
a
mostlymalty
but
slightlytoasty
aroma
with
slight
hints
of
chocolate
lactose
and
a
crisp
hop
character
the
flavors
are
subtle
and
light
but
take
on
more
chocolate
than
toast
or
milk
sweetness
but
rests
on
a
firm
sweet
malt
base
the
hops
are
also
light
sometimes
undecernable
between
english
and
american
varieties
yet
citrus
bittering
prevails
in
the
finish
the
beer
has
a
moderately
light
body
but
does
show
nice
creaminess
and
does
not
waiver
a

semifast
aromas
of
a
sweet
malty
caramel
and
chocolate
were
pleasantly
found
in
this
bad
boy
and
in
the
quaff
although
i
will
say
the
flavor
needed
a
bit
more
staying
power
for
this
to
make
up

the

this
is

very

reminded
me
strongly
of

beer
drinkability
beyond
the
simple
flavor
profile
i
found
this
to
be
quite
easy
to
drink
definite
session
beer
but
the
flavors
are
a
bit
thin
to
make
this
an
all
night
beer
a
decent
beer
basically
slightly
above
average
its
your
call
as
to
whether
to
try
it
i
could
have
used
two
or
three
instead
of
a
full
sixer
its
drinkable
but
not
recommended
by
me
anyway
if
i
ever
get
the
opportunity
ill
give
it
another
chance
probably
in
bottle
form
not
a
good
showing
this
time
around
d
this
is
by
far
the
best
mexican
style
beer
i
have
had
that
was
brewed
in
tennessee
it
had
a
decent
pairing
with
the
tacos
the
sweetness
balanced
the
spiciness
of
the
taco
i
generally
like
bolder
beers
but
this
has
good
potential
for
a
session
beer
d
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
beer
that
wellworth
sticking
with
for
an
evening
and
is
the
type
of
beer
that
can
either
be
a
good
sipper
or
a
good
pounder
yazoos
dos

pours
a
very
dark
brown
body
beneath
a
short
head
of
creamy
tan
foam
the
head
retention
is
average
but
it
leaves
some
nice
splashes
and
spots
of
lace
about
the
glass
a
whiff
of
cocoa
greets
you
in
the
nose
giving
you
a
hint
of
whats
to
come
its
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
very
fine
moderate
carbonation
that
gives
a
delicate
bristle
to
the
tongue
in
the
flavor
it
displays
a
touch
of
soft
milk
chocolate
supple
dried
fruit
a
flicker
of
juicy
berries
and
a
touch
of
malty
toastiness
its
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
are
limited
to
allow
the
maltiness
and
yeasty
fruitiness
to
shine
yet
its
superbly
balanced
by
a
delicate
acidity
that
couples
with
the
yeasty
fruitiness
to
give
the
impression
that
its
more
fruity
than
it
is
it
finishes
mostly
dry
with
a
pinch
of
cocoa
some
lingering
apricotlike
fruitiness
and
the
suggestion
of
some
leafy
and
grassy
hops
i
found
it
charming
interesting
enjoyable
and
really
easy
to
drink
highly
recommended
this
is
pretty
easy
drinking
if
you
happen
to
be
in
the
mood
for
a
sweeter

a
try

the
smell
is
clean
and
crisp
with
some

and
corn
the
taste
is
slightly
grainy
up

with
some

mixing
in

there
is
a
slight

of

decent
brown
ale
here
worth
picking
up
to
try
once
my
first
beer
from
tennessee
the
brewery
was
shooting
for
a
vienna
amber
similar
to
dos
equis
hence
the
play
on
the
name
while
im
in
general
a
fan
of
this
newer
brewery
this
particular
beer
falls
short
pours
surprising
dark
more
like
a
schwarzbier
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
grainy
and
the
bottle
notes
the
use
of
flaked
corn
which
is
perhaps
influencing
my
perception
but
i
seem
to
get
a
bit
too
much
corn
adjunct
in
the
flavor
dos
equis
is
certainly
not
the
best
of
its
style
but
i
have
to
say
id
choose
it
over
yazoos
try
in
the
brewerys
defense
they
havent
been
bottling
all
that
long
and
i
havent
tried
this
on
tap
yet
d
pretty
high
this
is
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
but
its
still
something
id
drink
every
now
and
again
a
solid
beer
allaround
i
like
the
subtle
spiciness
and
smooth
dextrin
body
it
is
unoffensive
with
a
good
mouthfeel
drinkability
a
refreshing
and
slightly
different
flavor
profile
dark
beer
light
yazoo
has
just
installed
a
bottling
line
in
the
last
month
the
dos
perros
has
a
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
disappointingly
vanishing
head
rich
sweet
malt
dominates
the
nose
and
the
flavor
with
nuances
of
hop
bitterness
for
balance
finish
is
very
smooth
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
could
drink
alot
of
this
very
nicely
done
brown
ale
had
this
on
tap
in
nashville
pours
a
standard
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
malty
aroma
but
low
on
the
nutlike
aroma
some
spices
in
there
the
flavor
is
a
little
weak
for
a
brown
but
still
good
well
balanced
with
the
hops
and
malts
easy
to
drink
but
it
could
use
a
little
something
extra
stopped
in
nashville
one
evening
and
ordered
a
bohanan
vanilla
creama
local
brew
bartender
said
the
brewery
was
taking
a
break
but
to
try
a
yazoo
as
a
local
option
nothing
other
than
the
appearance
reminded
me
of
a
classic
brown
alegood
balance
of
hops
and
malts
no
nuttiness
of
hints
of
caramel
or
chocolate
almost
like
a
heavier
newcastle
okay
choice
this
was
a
decent
beer
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
again
but
worth
trying
once
hoppy
a
decent
brown
fits
the
bill
for
a
brown
ale
but
not
a
standout
was
not
a
fan
i
didnt
like
the
hop
selection
in
this
beer
really
just
a
weak
mess
more
dry
than
hoppy
overly
thin
boring
borderline
off
festive
taste
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
craft
beer
glass
it
had
a
hazy
brown
color
that
was
clear
on
the
bottom
half
that
had
a
very
small
head
that
didnt
leave
lacing
it
smells
of
pine
and
hops
with
a
light
nuttiness
there
was
a
slightly
sweet
nutty
taste
up
front
with
sharp
pine
taking
over
in
the
middle
before
ending
with
a
slightly
bitter
hop
flavor
it
was
certainly
a
hoppy
brown
ale
as
advertised
but
it
was
slightly
unbalanced
and
couldve
used
more
nuttiness
to
balance
out
the
hops
mediumlight
body
with
moderate
carbonation
it
had
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
despite
the
bitter
hops
aftertaste
overall
it
is
a
well
hopped
brown
ale
that
left
room
for
improvement
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
didnt
like
it
enough
to
buy
it
again
ten
years
ago
i
considered
magic
hat
a
quality
craft
beer
brewer
today
i
consider
their
brews
light
weight
and
boring
i
do
think
that
some
of
their
stouts
and
porters
are
ok
and
some
of
their
limited
edition
brews
worth
tasting
this
brown
ale
is
ok
but
nothing
more
i
would
drink
again
if
another
bottle
was
offered
again
but
wouldnt
buy
really
empty
taste
imo
felt
heavily
carbonated
with
not
much
flavor
to
accompany
it
unlikely
ill
try
it
again

good

not
on

an

this
stuff

the

comprises
dry
maple
syrup
mild
caramel
mixed
greens
a
hint
of
pine
and
a
twinge
of
vague
nuttiness
the
taste
leads
with
some
meek
caramel
and
biscuit
then
goes
into
a
wave
of
greens
grass
and
mild
pine
and
then
ends
with
a
soft
touch
of
walnut
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
this
one
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
the
greens
overpower
most
of
the
malts
and
those
greens
dont
have
that
much
character
in
and
of
themselves
pass
a
very
nice
product
a
good
brown
ale
with
a
nice
balance
of
malts
and
a
bit
of
hop
bite
i
do
not
like
magic
hat
9
but
this
and
their
heart
of
darkness
are
fine
products
much
above
average
not
too
bad
for
a
mixed
case
it
almost
accomplishes
its
name
but
def
on
the
malty
caramelly
side
would
have
liked
a
little
more
hops
or
a
hoppy
bite
on
the
end
but
it
remained
on
the
sweet
easy
drinking
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
hoppy
browns
available
overall
well
its
not
too
bad
at
least
just
not
very
good
as
the
hops
and
malts
have
no
chance
at
balance
the
malts
would
have
been
nice
had
the
hops
not
just
smashed
it
like
a
bug
on
a
windshield
the
hops
are
fairly
boring
as
well
generic
boring
ipa
like
hops
if
they
were
in
a
nice
balance
the
choice
of
hops
might
have
been
a
bit
more
tolerable
o
an
interesting
choice
of
hops
earthy
and
grassy
for
a
hoppy
brown
ale
enjoyable
but
not
sure
that
i
would
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
o
a
nice
brown
ale
but
the
finish
is
too
hoppy
for
the
beer
happy
i
tried
it
but
dont
see
myself
buying
this
again
overall
a
solid
brown
ale
that
is
good
for
the
winter
would
have
it
again
overall
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
can
get
better
the
rest
not
a
bad
beer
i
dont
usually
care
for
magic
hat
much
but
this
isnt
too
bad
a
nice
twist
on
a
brown
ale
typical
magic
hat
kinda
offering
not
terrible
but
nothing
to
get
overly
excited
about
meh
sort
of
sums
it
up
just
generally
weak
not
much
color
not
much
aroma
and
not
much
flavor
nice
caramel
spice
aroma
when
poured
into
glass
finish
slightly
but
not
overly
bitter
good
balance
did
not
find
this
appealing
o
not
bad
but
not
good
i
would
say
a
tick
above
average
but
could
be
better
its
decent
a
little
bitter
but
ok
not
outstanding
but
competent
enough
o
2
50
lackluster
taste
across
the
palate
and
the
nose
just
nothing
exciting
or
noteworthy
i
wouldnt
drink
this
one
again
not
bad
just
not
good
either
overall
eh
its
okay
the
hoppy
finish
keeps
this
brew
from
being
a
terribly
bland
drink
got
a
heck
of
a
deal
at
costco
so
theres
no
room
to
complain
ill
gladly
drink
the
rest
and
move
on
from
there
its
an
alright
beer
nothing
crazy
good
there
is
some
malty
taste
and
some
hoppiness

cheaper
and
in
a
bottle
not
bad
looks
darker
than
it
tastes
nice
winter
warmer
could
drink
a
bunch
of
them
on
a
cold
day
watching
football
or
hockey
the
taste
has
a
good
malt
body
with
toasted
caramel
flavor
mixed
with
woody
and
light
citrus
hop
taste
and
slight
dark
toastiness
in
the
malt
as
it
warms
with
hint
of
spice
and
alcohol
in
the
taste
as
it
finishes
an
okay
brown
ale
more
or
less
but
not
exactly
inspired
a
run
of
the
mill
american
style
brown
brown
ale
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
but
little
head
no
noticible
hop
aroma
for
a
beer
that
advertises
as
a
hoppy
beer
taste
damk
bitterness
but
no
citrus
notes
some
staleness
light
mouthfeel
overall
a
little
disappointing
im
glad
hoppy
brown
ales
are
making
a
comeback
they
are
the
perfect
fall
beer
and
this
one
tastes
pretty
good
its
a
little
generic
on
the
hop
front
but
the
balance
between
the
chocolate
malt
and
the
bittering
is
well
done
and
there
is
a
definite
warming
quality
to
a
couple
of
these
one
thing
i
might
change
is
the
body
its
real
thin
i
think
for
the
season
and
the
style
and
even
light
for
the
bold
flavor
profile
of
the
beer
its
also
a
bit
under
carbonated
which
never
happens
with
magic
hat
but
is
not
nice
in
this
particular
beer
a
get
a
neat
toasted
coconut
flavor
to
the
grain
and
then
the
hops
it
almost
has
a
tropical
element
to
it
that
way
this
is
a
style
i
want
to
see
more
of
but
a
beer
thats
unique
but
far
from
perfect
a
few
tweaks
for
next
year
and
this
one
will
be
money
i
think
the
abv
is
right
on
too
for
the
style
and
the

would

this

again
incredible
beer
that

available
nearly
everywhere
has
a
hop
presence
like
a
torpedo
well
maybe
not
that
much
but
with
the
addition
of
a
roasted
flavor
i
think
they
work
really
well
together

a

i
get
a
light
scent
of
chocolate
malt
when
i
really
struggle
to
detect
it
the
dark
malt
with
chocolate
notes
presents
itself
more
boldly
in
the
flavor
theres
also
the
twist
of
having
some
grapefruit
like
hoppiness
in
the
mix
im
not
sure
this
flavor
pairing
is
working
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
o
this
is
basically
a
brown
apa
like
many
of
its
big
brother
black
ipa
relatives
has
hops
that
dont
mesh
as
well
with
the
malts
as
can
be
hoped
initially
served
at
about
40f
this
did
improve
becoming
more
maltforward
with
some
warming
it
claims
hoppy
and
it
is
about
the
same
as
most
american
brown
ales
i
would
say
more
than
than
traditional
english
that
being
said
it
does
have
a
firm
malt
backing
as
a
whole
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
particularly
special
but
it
is
a
solid
enjoyable
american
brown
ale
overall
the
variety
pack
made
it
worth
it
for
a
beer
i
could
try
without
investing
in
it
albeit
drinkable
this
is
nothing
i
will
look
for
again
too
hoppy
for
my
tastes
mostly
overpowering
the
brown
in
this
hoppy
brown
ale
o
a
nice
malty
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
hoppiness
to
keep
things
interesting
easy
to
drink
with
the
alcohol
providing
just
enough
warmth
for
those
colder
days
solid
very
well
balanced
hopiness
with
the
brown
ale
flavors
this
beer
has
something
for
ipa
and
ale
lovers
alike
leaves
you
with
a
nice
warming
sensation
with
every
sip
im
on
my
4th
6
pack
and
cant
get
enough
dont
generally
drink
magic
hat
but
theyve
really
got
a
hit
here
the
taste
has
a
decent
enough
nutty
malty
start
and
a
decent
enough
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
its
drinkable
but
it
is
nothing
special
overall
ill
give
a
4
for
snow
roller
magic
hat
brewing
company
great
brown
ale
smooth
without
a
bad
aftertaste
a
must
try
overall
excellent
very
quaffable
will
be
buying
again
if
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
here
very
easy
drinking
among
the
best
american
browns
ive
had
14
ibu
this
is
a
very
classic
american
ale
with
flavor
body
and
taste
i
really
like
this
in
the
winter
because
of
its
darker
flavor
components
but
it
is
still
smooth
and
light
enough
to
have
a
couple
the
flavor
is
really
well
balanced
and
nothing
is
overpowering
in
this
beer
this
beer
has
a
hearty
malt
flavor
and
exactly
as
the
label
states
brown
a
medium
brown
color
there
is
a
hint
of
chocolate
flavor
with
minimal
presence
of
hops
a
hint
of
light
roast
coffee
and
a
mild
bitterness
in
aroma
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
also
not
the
worst
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brown
ale
smooth
malty
goodness
o
very
good
example
of
a
brown
ale
well
suited
for
a
late
fall
bon
fire
one
of
my
favorite
shorts
brews
the
way
that
some
people
talk
about
shorts
brewing
youd
think
that
getting
your
hands
on
a
bottle
would
warrant
running
through
the
street
naked
in
celebration
but
in
my
experience
their
beers
arent
that
good
and
the
readily
available
stuff
is
rather
pedestrian
nonetheless
all
the
ones
ive
tried
have
been
wellmade
and
true
to
style
and
worth
buying
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
the
prickle
of
the
crispness
on
the
tongue
prevents
it
from
being
as
smooth
as
it
could
be
otherwise
theres
pretty
good
depth
in
the
feel
i
feel
this
brown
flirts
as
the
beginning
of
a
good
porter
a
splendid
brown
to
say
the
least
beer
was
drank
out
of
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
cloudy
appearance
but
the
beer
tastes
great
if
you
like
browns
please
dont
hesitate
to
try
has
a
coffee
like
undertone
but
definitely
not
to
strong
i
like
beers
that
finish
light
this
time
of
year
and
this
beer
delivers
could
also
be
enjoyed
as
a
cold
weather
favorite
o
while
this
is
dramatically
different
from
my
favorite
browns
dfh
indian
brown
and
smutty
old
brown
dog
which
tend
toward
the
hoppy
side
i
really
really
like
this
beer
it
has
a
unique
flavor
profile
that
suggest
bourbon
barrel
aging
to
me
i
know
it
wasnt
if
it
was
im
sure
theyd
pump
that
up
but
i
do
wonder
if
they
threw
in
some
barrel
chips
or
otherwise
infused
some
bourbon
flavoring
that
would
explain
the
slight
sourness
and
the
whiff
of
boozy
brown
liquor
i
caught
in
the
aroma
just
a
theory
in
any
event
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
o
a
brown
ale
quite
suitable
for
warmer
weather
due
to
its
light
qualities
yet
with
a
solid
flavor
enjoyable
to
the
last
sip
wish
now
i
had
bought
more
than
one
would
even
be
nice
as
a
light
breakfast
stout
in
summer
actually
drunk
at
breakfast
or
brunch
time
if
one
were
so
inclined
overall
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
overall
a
highly
drinkable
brown
ale
probably
in
my
top
3
for
the
style
i
could
drink
this
all
day
overall
the
most
enjoyable
thing
about
this
brew
was
its
flavoring
the
look
started
things
off
nicely
giving
good
color
and
a
nice
head
the
aroma
is
where
we
lost
points
as
it
lacked
general
robustness
and
let
the
malts
fall
too
far
to
the
back
in
their
inherent
aromatic
contributions
to
contrast
the
taste
showed
every
side
of
the
grain
with
bitterness
bready
sweetness
caramels
roast
and
earthiness
giving
a
little
something
different
at
each
turn
and
with
each
sip
the
drying
roast
on
the
feel
was
the
icing
on
the
cake
helping
to
keep
that
nice
flavoring
flowing
excellent
brown
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
ill
definitely
have
again
curious
to
see
if
the
sourness
in
the
aroma
is
characteristic
of
this
beer
meh
not
brilliant
although
the
aroma
gives
the
impression
that
it
could
have
been
there
are
some
nice
malty
hints
that
suggest
a
decent
brown
ale
lurks
underneath
the
acidic
offnotes
not
sure
what
happened
here
the
sourness
is
quite
clean
almost
like
yoghurt
bacteria
perhaps
or
maybe
its
just
age
without
a
bbbottledon
date
its
impossible
to
tell
oh
well
i
review
it
as
i
find
it
though
ill
rereview
if
i
get
a
fresh
one
someday
disappointing
taste
awesome
beer
the
taste
has
a
wallop
of
malts
but
also
consists
of
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
in
there
as
well
the
finish
has
a
dash
of
spice
and
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
but
its
just
about
perfectly
balanced
against
the
sweetness
the
feel
may
be
the
beers
highlight
very
smooth
but
not
too
thick
or
cloying
and
satisfying
this
may
just
be
my
favorite
drink
anytime
fall
seasonal
and
my
favorite
normal
beer
from
shorts
overall
o
a
good
brown
ale
but
nothing
that
really
blew
me
away
enjoyable
overall
malt
heavy
flavor
toffee
on
the
nose
but
once
its
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
becomes
less
refined
a
more
lightly
burnt
caramel
swallow
while
mentioning
those
flavors
however
the
beer
is
arguably
more
drinkable
and
a
bit
more
clean
than
the
standard
brown
the
sweetness
which
is
prominent
is
not
overpowering
and
while
my
personal
taste
favors
a
stronger
hop
presence
especially
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
a
favorable
version
of
a
malt
heavy
brew
overall
and
particularly
if
youre
a
fan
of
browns
try
this
beer
as
always
life
is
shorts
all
these
beers
ive
had
by
shorts
keep
advertising
all
the
wide
variety
of
ingredients
they
are
putting
in
each
beer
the
label
on
this
one
reads
a
classic
american
brown
ale
theres
nothing
wrong
with
sticking
to
the
traditional
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
making
it
better
through
your
skill
and
know
how
o
a
solid
easy
drinking
brown
if
you
are
in
the
distribution
area
i
recommend
grabbing
a
six
pack
for
a
full
flavored
session
beer
medium
in
body
but
watered
down
not
much
carbonation
which
leads
me
to
think
that
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
oh
well
thats
why
breweries
need
to
put
some
dating
info
on
the
bottle
so
it
goes
o
one
track
mind
brown
ale
doesnt
mess
around
really
tasty
do
this
ale
is
a
mediocre
effort
from
a
brewery
that
is
known
for
putting
quirky
and
unique
twists
on
traditional
beer
styles
although
the
texture
is
unconvincing
in
general
it
is
the
early
acidity
that
holds
this
beer
back
from
being
a
better
example
of
its
style
not
the
most
exciting
of
styles
but
this
was
an
above
average
brown
ale
for
sure
a
great
nuttiness
and
toffee
taste
medium
bodied
with
nice
dark
brown
color
this
been
finished
clean
and
smooth
and
was
more
tasty
than
most
for
the
pretty
generic
style
wont
knock
your
pants
off
but
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
local
brown
ale
that
is
not
too
pricey
and
is
easy
going
and
is
great
for
fall

poured
into
a

the
ale
was
dark
with
a
a
certain
degree
of
cloudiness
in
the
brown
coloring
it
had
only
a
slight
head
that
disappeared
quickly
in
the
aroma
the
ale
was
tart
and
perhaps
even
vinegary
it
was
not
the
most
enticing
aroma
the
first
sip
was
a
dry
chocolatey
taste
with
notes
of
prune
and
a
delightful
hint
of
chocolate
covered
cherries
the
tartness
largely
overshadows
the
sweet
notes
which
is
appropriate
for
the
style
in
the
big
picture
it
combines
to
demonstrate
elements
of
a
sour
ale
the
aftertaste
was
dry
which
continued
the
initial
impression
the
ale
left
a
nice
dark
chocolate
coating
on
the
tonuge
allowed
to
linger
by
the
modest
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
deep
rich
mahogany
that
falls
just
short
of
opaque
the
beer
has
little
scent
but
what
there
is
smells
a
bit
nutty
theres
plenty
of
flavor
though
with
the
nuttyness
being
the
least
of
it
surprisingly
sweet
for
a
brown
it
tastes
almost
like
a
lightly
sweetened
mocha
latte
not
bad
overall
i
quite
like
this
brown
ales
are
typically
one
of
the
more
plain
styles
and
while
this
one
didnt
venture
out
and
do
anything
crazy
to
the
style
it
nearly
nailed
all
the
texbook
characteristics
of
a
classic
american
brown
ale
aroma
is
more
subtle
than
id
choose
with
only
a
hint
of
the
roasted
chocolate
malts
that
are
so
well
presented
in
the
taste
caramelized
malts
and
nuttiness
are
well
balanced
with
a
delightfully
spicy
and
lingering
finish
m
medium
bodied
creamy
with
good
carbonation
o
overall
a
average
beer
there
wasnt
a
lot
going
on
in
it
i
just
basically
had
it
in
a
mixed
six
pack
so
it
was
worth
a
try
not
something
i
would
seek
out
o
this
is
solid
as
a
beer
comes
one
of
shorts
best
selections
among
many
and
i
will
keep
this
in
my
regular
year
round
repertoire
a
classic
american
brown
overall
decent
brown
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
repeatable
this
is
a
nice
brown
ale
well
suited
to
michigans
cooler
temperatures
its
a
good
session
beer
with
an
agreeable
price
to
value
ratio
it
has
an
interesting
malthops
balance
though
it
seemed
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
thought
it
would
it
would
make
a
nice
beer
for
sitting
around
and
watching
a
football
game
with
friends
always
a
good
thing
o
light
bodied
too
highly
carbonated
lacking
complexity
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
cocoa
flavor
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
body
is
relatively
thin
with
an
above

carbonation
theres
a
brief
sourness
in
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
is
brief
overall
not
a
bad
brown
ale
at
all
i
got
very
mild
flavors
and
hops
so
i
assume
my
bottle
might
have
been
over
a
month
old
but
it
was
still
very
tasty
and
drinkable
being
malt
forward
tasty
stuff
guys
o
a
different
brown
that
im
not
fond
enough
of
to
seek
out
again
an
above

beer
i
probably
wont
have
again

a
very
drinkable
beer
and
would
have
it
again
overall
a
fair
brown
ale
perhaps
a
bit
weak
on
taste
and
mouthfeel
but
decent
enough
to
drink
again
d
id
certainly
have
this
one
again
complex
nice
flavors
and
its
drinkable
to
boot
overall
its
probably
a
little
old
dated
11711
not
something
i
would
otherwise
revisit
overall
i
think
i
am
2
for
15
with
shorts
bottles
due
to
refermentation
issues
there
are
no
such
issues
here
but
this
beer
really
does
not
do
much
to
impress
me
either
12
ounce

pours
crystal
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
fairly
dense
2
finger
light
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
fairly
thick
lacing
cap
some
bits
of
lacing
cling
to
the
side
of
the
glass
as
well
aromas
of
caramel
toasted
malts
bread
brown
sugar
nuttiness
and
a
good
amount
of
spicy

fairly
nice

light
chocolate
bread
nuttiness
light
coffee
and

decent
amount
of

on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of

caramel
and
spicy
hops
on
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
that
drinks
smoothly
no
alcohol
noticed
at
all
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
bitterness
overall
a
very
nice
and
tasty
brown
ale
that
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
o
not
really
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
easily
drinkable
but
with
an
odd
flavor
profile
certainly
extends
the
range
of
the
style
the
beer
tastes
fresh
enough
so
i
dont
think
its
an
old
batch
i
might
try
another
of
their
beers
in
a
mixed
six
pack
but
this
beer
doesnt
make
me
want
to
run
out
and
get
more
a
pretty
good
standard
brown
ale
pours
a
cocoa
colored
semitranparent
with
a
one
inch
cream
colored
head
smells
a
bit
like
a
cup
of
coffee
with
some
good
roasted
characteristics
and
a
sturdy
malt
vibe
tastes
a
little
nutty
almonds
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
right
on
medium
nothing
makes
this
beer
stand
out
to
me
but
it
is
well
balanced
and
drinkable
will
look
into
some
more
shorts
brews
o
its
a
solid
brown
ale
bellaire
brown
is
probably
the
most
simple
straight
forward
beer
ive
had
from
shorts
brewing
company
thats
not
a
bad
thing
it
actually
works
pretty
well
for
a
brown
ale
it
isnt
quite
as
malty
as
you
might
think
it
actually
features
a
nice
interplay
of
malt
and
earthy
hops
i
like
it
it
would
benefit
from
a
little
more
body
and
perhaps
a
stronger
nose
good
stuff
though
recommended
overalli
am
pretty
disappointed
i
have
had
a
couple
of
other
shorts
beers
and
loved
them
brown
ales
arent
my
favorite
style
but
i
do
enjoy
them
and
this
isnt
a
great
example
not
sure
if
the
sourness
is
intentional
or
not
if
so
i
will
give
them
credit
for
trying
something
different
but
it
doesnt
float
my
boat
o
trying
to
review
by
style
even
though
i
am
definitely
not
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
better
browns
ive
had
but
not
one
that
will
make
me
purchase
again
o
shorts
bellaire
brown
is
literally
one
funky
brew
either
theyre
intentionally
brewing
one
offthewall
brown
ale
or
this
is
slightly
infected
either
way
this
wasnt
my
cup
of
tea
and
was
quite
happy
to
have
shared
the
rest
of
these
with
unknowing
friends
12oz
bottle
from
a
mixed
sixer
dark
brown
color
good
head
smells
like
a
malty
brown
nice
the
flavor
is
like
an
english
brown
ale
and
even
has
this
odd
touch
of
vinegar
that
i
always
detect
in
good
english
style
brown
ales
maybe
its
just
me
overall
i
liked
it
and
felt
like
it
was
true
to
style
but
what
do
i
know
overall
a
really
nice
brown
ale
this
is
a
style
that
is
perfect
for
the
season
and
really
doesnt
get
enough
attention
from
american
brewers
nicely
done
shorts
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
nonbeer
lover
to
try
it
does
have
a
bit
of
hops
but
the
interesting
sweet
and
malty
flavor
of
chestnuts
might
be
appealing
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
have
to
give
shorts
credit
for
juicing
up
the
flavor
overall
a
good
beer
all
around
d
pretty
solid
brown
ale
more
sweet
and
cookieish
than
other
examples
i
have
had
of
this
style
but
it
worked
well
i
could
see
myself
having
multiples
at
a
bar
if
it
were
available
notes
quite
the
tasty
american
brown
ale
one
of
the
more
unique
ones
cheers
very
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
the
cooler
temps
that
michigan
offers
this
is
a
great
american
brown
ale
and
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
found
out
there
delicious
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
other
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
o
shorts
just
needs
to
get
their
act
together
o
all
in
all
this
beer
kind
of
blows
this
one
is
ok
but
nothing
worth
buying
again
dont
bother
with
this
brew
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
not
a
good
beer
rethink
this
one
shorts
othis
was
an
ok
representation
of
the
style
but
it
wasnt
my
favorite
it
felt
a
little
too
watery
in
the
mouth
for
me
i
think
i
would
have
preferred
a
more
balanced
and
fuller
beer
o
overall
the
lingering
taste
is
good
and
prolonged
the
body
is
great
for
style
this
is
a
solid
shorts
offering
with
a
great
hit
at
a
classic
style
not
going
over
the
top
with
the
unique
additions
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
balancenof
sweet
and
roasted
malts
toasty
with
hints
of
caramel
hazelnut
and
toffee
complimented
by
some
zesty
spice
notes
especially
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
the
hops
provide
a
nice
dry
bitterness
that
balances
out
the
sweeter
notes
and
linger
into
a
dry
finish
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
pretty
quaffable
o
good
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
but
it
just
blends
in
with
a
lot
of
the
other
browns
ive
had
nothing
overly
special
about
it
a
decent
beer
thats
good
but
nothing
other
than
the
sourness
really
stands
out
about
it
overall
pretty
good
for
the
style
but
strangely
not
drawn
to
it
compared
to
other
makers
of
this
style
can
drink
no
problem
no
complaints
for
one
of
the
few
times
in
reviewing
brew
i
find
the
mouthfeel
really
detracts
from
the
overall
enjoyment
of
this
beer
very
unique
version
of
the
style
glad
i
found
a
bottle
and
was
able
to
experience
this
taste
starts
with
biscuity
maltiness
tannins
and
some
fruit
in
the
middle
with
a
lightly
biting
hoppy
close
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
drinkability
is
alright
as
well
not
all
i
was
hoping
but
not
a
bad
brew
overall
a
plain
example
of
a
brown
which
i
find
a
bit
surprising
coming
from
shorts
overall
a
great
brown
dont
drink
browns
too
much
but
if
i
had
access
to
this
i
would
buy
it
often
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
a
mild
flavor
of
sweetness
up
front
some
ashy
bitterness
at
the
back
and
some
plain
mild
tobacco
in
the
middle
it
is
decent
but
not
great
id
have
it
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
decent
sessioner
brown
ales
always
work
as
the
base
of
a
marinade
that
the
best
i
can
say
about
this
one
i
wasnt
impressed
by
the
smell
but
the
taste
was
actually
very
nice
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
o
one
of
the
most
unique
brews
ive
ever
had
i
would
love
to
have
this
brew
around
all
the
time
i
wonder
what
would
happen
with
age
brew
is
off
style
but
great
nevertheless
a
great
brew
in
a
great
trade
overall
pretty
good
beer
not
over
priced
pretty
cool
bottle
and
cap
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
worth
a
try
overall
a
solid
sessionable
brown
ale
nothing
too
over
the
top
but
one
to
sit
with
i
would
pick
this
up
again
but
there
are
several
other
shorts
beers
i
would
grab
ahead
of
this
one
o
great
example
of
a
brown
ale
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
recently
if
i
got
more
of
this
as
extras
i
wouldnt
be
upset
and
if
they
had
this
at
my
local
shop
i
would
have
this
on
had
for
guest
that
usually
drink
newcastle
7
110
if
brown
ales
were
little
children
in
a
swimming
pool
this
one
would
bob
at
the
comfy
safe
shallow
end
afraid
to
move
for
fear
of
of
i
dont
have
any
idea
it
just
seemed
like
a
good
metaphor
for
this
beer
its
nice
and
safe
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
not
too
smelly
not
too
tasty
not
too
much
of
anything
yet
it
still
manages
to
be
pleasant
to
drink
it
has
the
round
nongrapefruity
citrus
zing
of
a
good
uk
ale
which
i
find
appealing
but
it
doesnt
have
much
else
brown
ales
need
not
be
as
dense
as
a
stout
or
a
porter
but
they
ought
to
have
more
umph
than
this
thanks
duffextracold
a
good
beer
to
wash
down
a
long
mountain
bike
ride
thanks
to
funkyaudio
for
the
extra
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
clear
deep
mahogany
that
wears
the
thinnest
head
that
brown
ale
remains
rather
subtle
on
the
nose
deploying
its
creamy
nuttiness
and
soft
roast
whispers
over
a
caramel
and
thinned
out
molasses
foundation
warming
up
it
opens
up
a
bit
and
develops
a
mineral
fruitiness
possibly
from
its
hops
but
while
slightly
flowery
those
feel
quite
tired
and
tamed
down
the
beer
did
taste
a
little
syrupy
definitely
picking
up
roasted
malts
caramel
and
brown
sugar
throughout
medium
bodied
and
light
carbonation
which
was
a
little
disappointing
yet
this
was
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
mini
hop
snap
on
the
finish
glad
i
only
picked
up
a
single
of
this
beer
and
not
a
6
pack
o
i
am
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
though
this
is
the
one
i
normally
grab
when
i
am
in
the
mood
has
plenty
of
tasty
qualities
and
if
it
is
fresh
it
is
hard
to
beat
it
is
nice
on
a
cold
day
or
after
a
coffee
o
a
shorts
beer
that
wasnt
that
sour
hooray
actually
ive
grown
to
dig
some
of
their
sour
weirdness
however
this
one
was
played
straight
down
the
middle
and
i
appreciate
it
for
that
this
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
two
finger
cream
head
that
leaves
traces
of
lace
on
the
nose
there
are
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
toffee
sweetness
and
maybe
just
a
pleasing
little
bit
of
husky
grain
in
the
mouth
there
stand
slightly
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
notes
with
the
roasted
malt
fading
a
bit
further
in
the
mix
im
not
getting
much
in
the
way
of
bitterness
anywhere
here
which
combines
with
a
medium
thin
body
to
provide
very
little
in
the
way
of
a
finish
for
me
thats
really
the
only
knock
on
this
beer
this
is
something
that
people
who
dont
know
they
like
beer
might
like
but
has
plenty
going
on
for
people
who
do
like
beer
big
thanks
to
my
sister
for
getting
a
mixed
6
with
this
and
a
bunch
of
other
great
stuff
in
it
not
a
bad
ale
but
mediocre
overall
shorts
can
do
and
has
done
much
better
decent
but
a
too
thin
and
light
for
me
considering
the
style
the
beer
is
more
thin
than
medium
bodied
has
a
sweet
underneath
slightly
floral
overlaid
by
a
bittering
leafy
hop
some
acidic
notes
a
touch
of
soury
cherry
this
is
a
brown
ale
thats
barely
hanging
in
there
and
is
more
typical
of
other
styles
im
not
sold
on
this
beer
its
a
decent
beer
but
it
is
just
not
a
creamy
roasted
chocolatey
and
nutty
type
brown
that
im
interested
in
the
acidic
notes
the
cherry
tartness
the
leafy
hop
just
make
this
an
odd
ball
for
the
style
its
not
bad
but
not
what
i
had
my
mouth
set
for
either
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
brown
ale
and
one
of
my
favorites
to
date
dfh
indian
brown
still
takes
1
for
me
but
i
would
put
this
solidly
in
the
2nd
tier
along
with
rogue
john
john
hazelnut
and
sweetwater
sweet
georgia
brown
highly
recommended
o
solid
3
5
across
the
board
nice
brown
ale
better
than
average
but
nothing
crazy
enjoyed
the
taste
but
not
one
id
seek
out
when
looking
for
a
brown
ale
kind
of
plain
a
bit
boring
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
smooth
with
a
nice
medium
body
there
is
a
nice
drinkable
feel
that
goes
down
easy
o
im
kind
of
on
the
fence
with
browns
but
i
liked
this
one
good
beer
o
a
good
brown
ale
i
like
the
use
of
malts
in
this
beer
seems
to
drink
easier
than
most
browns
while
maintaining
that
rich
overall
flavor
medium
bodied
higher
carbonation
a
bit
dry
on
the
tongue
drinks
smooth
and
easy
solid
flavor
although
nothing
too
unusual
especially
for
shorts
the
cpj
drink
is
decent
bit
of
a
sweet
almost
sticky
finish
but
not
too
bad
sessionable
essentially
smooth
and
malty
nothing
overbearing
balanced
well
and
im
surprised
to
hear
myself
say
this
in
my
head
that
it
could
maybe
even
use
a
bit
more
american
hops
very
drinkable
and
clean
solid
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
nice
malty
flavors
to
it
and
was
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
it
had
more
cocoa
and
chocolate
to
it
than
most
brown
ales
and
the
fruity
tart
notes
seemed
odd
in
the
aroma
for
the
style
but
it
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
overall
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
something
it
was
kinda
weird
tasting
at
first
but
nice
when
it
warmed
up
i
am
a
fan
of
brown
ales
and
this
one
even
warmer
wasnt
great
overall
bellaire
brown
is
a
nice
quaffable
brown
ale
that
has
some
good
things
going
for
it
but
falls
a
bit
short
for
my
taste
the
aroma
is
pretty
nice
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
boring
and
lacks
that
nice
nutty
character
that
i
love
in
brown
ales
this
is
still
a
quality
beer
though
and
if
you
are
ever
at
shorts
pub
in
the
city
that
is
this
beer
takes
its
name
from
you
may
want
to
have
a
pint
the
beer
starts
off
fine
pouring
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
pretty
good
offwhite
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
dark
fruits
along
with
a
bit
of
an
acetic
character
in
the
background
the
taste
is
just
downright
awful
this
is
essentially
vinegar
at
this
point
and
really
disgusting
not
much
else
to
say
about
it
the
mouthfeel
is
puckering
and
sour
burning
my
throat
drain
pour
to
the
max
i
enjoyed
this
beer
for
its
smooth
crisp
and
flavorful
qualities
and
high
drinkability
for
an
american
brown
ale
this
beer
has
some
unique
elements
to
it
further
this
one
seems
like
a
worthy
candidate
for
a
session
beer
i
will
buy
this
again
thats
the
long
and
shorts
of
it
all
pass
md
a
nice
smooth
feeling
beer
that
is
on
the
thin
and
watery
side
another
reviewer
said
that
is
to
be
expected
from
shorts
beer
and
i
will
agree
that
most
are
thin
and
watery
but
that
also
makes
it
a
nice
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brown
ale
if
i
did
not
get
the
quote
or
remark
from
the
other
reviewer
exactly
than
sorry
about
that
until
next
time
enjoy
your
favorite
shorts
beer
this
quickly
became
my
brown
ale
of
choice
i
could
and
have
drank
this
all
night
very
easy
to
drink
with
no
trace
of
alcohol
just
a
pleasant
but
nothing
special
brown
ale
dpretty
easy
going
and
interesting
drink
all
around
a
roasty
and
nutty
taste
dominates
this
brew
they
say
this
is
a
classic
american
brown
ale
but
i
think
its
the
next
step
up
to
what
brown
ales
are
going
in
the
craft
scene
ive
never
been
able
to
drink
alot
of
any
brown
ale
due
to
the
sweetness
of
most
but
this
i
could
probably
make
an
exception
for
not
bad
drinkability
a
pretty
decent
brown
ale
though
i
dont
care
for
the
nutskin
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
reviewed
on
6292010
on
tap
at
shorts
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
super
sweet
malt
and
raisins
flavor
of
very
sweet
malt
almost
juicelike
due
to
the
sweetness
with
a
thin
palate
it
was
a
pretty
disappointing
brown
ale
d
yes
this
is
quite
enjoyable
nicely
made
simple
and
tasty
went
perfect
with
the
5
course
italian
dinner
i
had
it
with
and
as
it
warmed
it
just
got
sweeter
and
better
something
that
is
a
little
different
then
a
traditional
brown
but
is
a
winner
in
my
book
overall
this
is
a
pretty
well
done
brew
different
then
most
browns
but
shorts
is
a
different
kind
of
brewery
so
i
never
expect
the
norm
from
them
there
is
for
sure
room
in
my
fridge
for
this
beer
bellaire
brown
has
an
oily
mouthfeel
im
not
a
big
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
a
better
one
would
be
great
in
late
october
or
winter
time
pours
a
light
translucent
brown
color
with
a
small
1finger
light
tan
head
that
left
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
smells
slightly
nutty
with
notes
of
caramel
sweetness
and
some
citrus
the
taste
is
that
of
roasted
malts
some
sour
notes
sweetness
citrus
and
a
little
hint
of
chocolate
at
the
finish
there
was
no
hop
flavor
which
seems
odd
to
me
since
the
last
brown
ale
i
had
from
shorts
was
quite
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
this
beer
goes
down
pretty
smooth
and
is
pretty
creamy
its
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
and
it
has
nice
carbonation
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
theres
not
much
that
really
stands
out
in
this
beer
but
i
still
think
its
nice
d
overall
a
bit
scattered
in
all
areas
this
leaves
me
wondering
where
this
one
was
when
it
was
fresh
still
drinkable
drinkability
interesting
taste
of
peanut
butter
here
but
all
in
all
nothing
special
wont
revisit
again
based
not
only
on
its
overall
mediocrity
but
also
its
lack
of
availability
big
thanks
to
enelson
for
including
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
awhile
back
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
to
tan
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
chocolate
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
was
of
slightly
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
caramel
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
and
smooth
borwn
ale
for
sure
had
a
very
nice
flavor
with
a
decent
aroma
the
aroma
could
have
used
a
little
work
though
in
my
opinion
to
make
it
stand
out
as
more
of
a
brown
ale
however
this
is
a
must
try
for
any
brown
ale
fan
out
there
flavor
mirrors
the
aroma
closely
but
adds
a
medicinalshoe
polish
note
to
the
finish
reminiscent
of
a
good
english
ale
hops
are
again
veggielike
and
the
malts
are
where
they
should
be
with
toasted
chocolate
and
caramel
solid
mouthfeel
to
the
medium
body
slick
creamy
and
nicely
carbonated
with
a
hop
bite
on
the
dry
finish
overall
i
found
bellaire
to
be
a
playitsafe
brown
ale
that
still
manages
to
get
the
job
done
worth
seeking
out
at
least
once
d
very
high
id
order
a
second
and
definitely
buy
six
a
good
goto
winter
beer
thanks
nate
all
in
all
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
decent
and
fairly
drinkable
not
near
as
good
as
the
sn
tumbler
or
other
brown
ales
out
there
and
definitely
not
one
of
shorts
best
offerings
doubt
i
would
purchase
again
but
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
this
either
fairly
average
very
drinkable
at
5
2abv
overall
this
one
smelled
like
it
would
be
amazing
with
a
very
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
but
the
flavor
profile
didnt
quite
pull
through
still
its
a
very
nice
beer
thats
worth
a
shot
d
a
nice
loweralcohol
brew
with
enough
brown
ale
flavors
to
keep
me
content

the
taste
is

pretty
sweet
up

with
some

nabbed
one
o
these
out
o
my
buddys

during
our
fantasy
football
draft
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
ruby
brown
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
cocoa
toffee
caramel
light
coriander
and
some
seemingly
random
miscellaneous
florals
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
with
notes
of
cocoa
powder
toffee
brown
sugar
sugarfree
maple
syrup
and
a
more
decisive
orange
zest
leaning
toward
mandarinstyle
light
syrup
of
course
the

is
a
heavy
light
with
a
light
moderate

and
a
smooth

maybe
a

away
from
being
really
good
medium
brown
color
that
is
slightly
translucent
two
fingers
of
head
that
had
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thin
cap
just
a
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
good
aroma
of
chocolate
nuts
and
caramel
there
is
a
little
acidity
lingering
in
the
background
but
it
is
barely
percepatable
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
but
does
not
pack
the
same
power
it
is
nutty
with
some
caramel
the
chocolate
seems
to
have
disappeared
again
there
is
a
little
acidity
bitterness
is
very
low
and
hops
are
not
detectable
this
could
be
an
english
brown
with
what
i
can
taste
the
body
feels
a
little
thin
but
carbonation
keeps
things
positive
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
guess
that
was
the
brewers
objective
i
would
like
a
little
more
flavor
and
body
but
otherwise
a
good
brown
drinkability
rich
and
roasty
with
good
balance
and
phenomenal
mouthfeel
this
may
give
flossmoors
pullman
brown
a
run
for
my
favorite
brown
ale
in
any
case
this
is
a
brown
ale
that
cannot
be
missed
notes
not
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
but
is
worth
trying
ill
probably
drink
it
again
but
there
is
nothing
that
separates
it
from
the
pack
and
makes
it
great
overall
i
did
not
enjoy
this
brew
very
much
and
i
like
brown
ales
sorry
but
ill
pass
next
time
a
pretty
drinkable
brown
ale
overall
i
could
easily
kick
back
a
few
d
more
lightly
hopped
than
some
american
brown
ales
ive
had
but
wonderful
toasted
malt
character
throughout
another
impressive
brew
from
shorts
goes
down
ok
a
bit
subdued
all
around
but
without
much
enticing
subtleties
to
keep
me
looking
forward
to
the
next
sip
not
great
overall
not
the
best
brown
i
have
had
it
seems
to
have
an
off
flavor
to
it
somewhat
drinkable
pours
a
rich
warm
dark
brown
with
an
average
light
tan
head
strong
malty
aroma
has
an
overtone
of
molasses
and
is
somewhat
sweet
lipsmacking
flavor
is
malty
with
a
strong
molasses
component
and
sweet
without
being
cloying
texture
is
smooth
and
lightly
fizzy
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
example
of
a
brown
ale
something
i
wish
i
could
buy
more
consistently
in
my
area
shorts
rarely
disappoints
and
this
is
no
exception
d
this
goes
down
ridiculously
easy
nice
flavoring
nice
kick
well
balanced
this
is
most
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
this
beer
is
sweet
but
drinkable
i
wouldnt
put
this
on
my
top
ten
session
beers
though
d
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
and
probably
will
very
soon
id
recommend
this
to
someone
who
loves
fat
tire
and
wants
a
beer
with
more
body
and
a
richer
malt
character
received
as
an
extra
my
first
shorts
beer
pours
a
nice
nutty
brown
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
offwhite
head
aromas
of
dark
fruit
chestnuts
and
maybe
gingerbread
on
the
palate
this
one
is
nice
and
malty
with
brown
sugar
cocoa
powder
and
milk
chocolate
a
nice
introduction
to
an
interesting
brewery
average
sessionability
d
a
well
thought
out
brown
beer
quite
tasty
granted
bitter
dark
beers
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
really
let
me
down
considering
the
reputation
that
shorts
has
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
rest
of
their
lineup
soon
easy
to
drink
with
some
nice
roasted
flavor
but
the
flavor
is
really
lacking
at
times
too
not
a
bad
brown
ale
but
nothing
spectacular
either
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
this
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
very
sessionable
brown
ale
d
pretty
solid
beer
really
like
what
is
going
in
with
the
sweet
and
toastiness
of
the
malt
bill
on
this
beer
well
balanced
in
the
hop
department
but
malty
enough
to
keep
from
drying
you
out
but
hoppy
enough
to
keep
things
from
getting
too
slick
and
sloppy
all
right
as
a
session
beer
or
something
to
drink
with
a
game
of
8ball
im
stripes
ok
this
is
pretty
good
i
wish
i
had
gotten
to
it
sooner
the
beer
pours
a
mediumhazy
brown
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
and
toffee
almost
smells
like
an
english
brown
ale
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
nutty
caramel
and
toffee
with
some
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
thinmedium
mouthfeel
and
lowmedium
carbonation
d
i
buy
this
semiregulary
and
it
is
my
favorite
american
brown
ale
for
sure
definitely
easy
to
drink
at
5
2
and
i
think
if
you
can
try
this
you
should
d
highly
drinkable
a
welldone
brown
ale
d
pretty
low
cant
say
that
id
try
this
again
drinkability
i
really
cant
get
past
the
flavors
and
their
unpleasantness
like
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
review
i
would
gladly
give
it
a
shot
again
and
edit
this
if
it
comes
out
better
body
is
just
shy
of
medium
with
ample
carbonation
solid
beer
and
my
first
from
shorts
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
great
malty
depth
and
complexity
the
light
hopping
works
well
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
with
its
nice
flavor
and
smooth
mouthfeel
and
finish
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
a
brown
ale
i
am
pleased
that
i
decided
to
pick
this
beer
up
to
try
poured
very
dark
caramel
brown
could
not
see
through
my
glass
slightly
hazy
look
sweet
malty
smell
and
taste
just
a
little
hops
bitterness
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
considering
its
sweetness
lack
of
carbonation
makes
it
finish
a
little
thick
note
tasting
notes
from
8309
clear
medium
chestnut
a
bit
on
the
reddish
side
with
a
one
inch
cap
of
dark
beige
foam
smells
great
malty
and
toasted
with
some
mild
chocolate
and
roast
notes
biscuity
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
but
that
works
here
with
such
a
rich
aroma
moderate
bitterness
with
a
distinct
orange
sweetness
from
the
hops
malt
character
was
basically
the
same
as
the
aroma
and
contributed
significant
malt
sweetness
in
addition
to
the
toasted
chocolate
and
slight
roasted
flavours
it
finished
a
bit
nutty
with
a
balanced
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
nice
texture
quite
tasty
and
a
solid
brown
ale
overall
a
nice
brown
if
fairly
mild
flavorwise
probably
the
leastimpressive
shorts
offering
ive
had
which
is
saying
something
about
the
rest
of
their
brews
another
fun
find
from
the
ohoove
cellars
this
one
is
a
very
dark
brown
brew
with
a
fair
light
tan
head
and
fair
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
evergreen
malt
decent
and
pretty
full
the
taste
brings
mildly
bitter
coffee
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
sweetness
all
in
a
swampy
bath
of
tingly
but
somewhat
watery
brew
i
do
get
a
touch
of
citrus
hop
that
confuses
into
the
coffee
its
plenty
drinkable
and
a
decent
option
for
the
style
but
a
bit
thin
and
not
particularly
memorable
solid
beer
all
around
and
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
in
the
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
for
an
easydrinker
a
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
fulfilling
in
taste
and
readily
available
a
very
nice
beer
d
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
not
my
favorite
style
but
well
worth
it
drinkability
it
didnt
take
me
long
to
finish
the
12oz
so
it
is
rather
drinkable
and
i
guess
thats
what
shorts
intended
still
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
1
at
a
sitting
a
little
more
grabbing
power
in
the
flavours
would
sovle
that
after
california
michigan
is
my
second
favorite
state
when
it
comes
to
craft
beer
shorts
may
not
be
bells
or
founders
but
theyre
pretty
good
in
their
own
right
bellaire
browns
label
reads
a
classic
american
brown
ale
i
couldnt
agree
more
d
a
great
example
of
the
brown
worth
a
try
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
and
formed
a
light
tan
foamy
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
malts
chocolate
and
bourbon
the
flavor
was
of
malt
coffee
caramel
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
body
was
medium
light
and
the
finish
slight
astringent
and
bitter
d
a
pleasure
to
drink
good
balance
flavorful
sessionworthy
strength
nice
surprise
as
an
extra
thanks
seb
a
solid
choice
and
among
the
better
american
browns
ive
tried
md
really
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
it
is
a
brown
ale
so
not
too
strong
but
not
as
weak
as
other
browns
such
as
newcastle
this
is
my
favorite
brown
ale
nice
color
fairly
clear
though
a
bit
of
yeast
falls
in
at
the
finish
its
kind
of
a
reddish
brown
not
like
a
brown
on
the
blacker
side
with
a
kind
of
thin
head
about
a
cm
or
so
and
it
looks
pretty
loose
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
smells
pretty
good
like
some
burnt
caramellized
sugars
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
background
and
a
very
nice
clean
sweetness
in
the
beer
nice
and
grainy
i
think
this
fits
the
bill
of
a
nice
brown
ale
nothing
excessive
everything
in
nice
balance
the
taste
has
all
the
things
from
the
smell
with
a
tiny
bit
of
sweet
coffee
thrown
in
there
too
starts
on
a
nice
little
roasty
toasty
note
comes
in
a
bit
grainy
like
raw
grainy
then
it
gets
a
bit
sweet
with
the
nice
burnt
sugars
and
a
bit
of
bread
too
all
of
the
flavors
kind
of
blend
in
nicely
in
the
end
with
some
good
cleanness
i
like
the
taste
but
its
not
a
standout
one
of
the
beers
you
could
drink
often
but
i
doubt
if
i
would
crave
it
the
body
is
kind
of
thin
i
think
with
a
burst
of
carbonation
at
the
start
and
it
disappears
quickly
its
quite
alright
but
nothing
too
great
the
drinkability
is
probably
the
best
part
nice
and
interesting
not
a
heavy
hitter
nice
balance
and
despite
the
lighter
body
is
satisfying
and
enjoyable
i
would
reach
for
another
if
i
didnt
have
something
else
to
drink
it
pours
out
a
deep
rich
beerbottlebrown
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
tan
head
smells
great
chocolate
carmel
toffee
roasted
malt
i
detect
all
of
these
with
the
nose
tastes
just
as
it
smells
but
with
a
buttery
note
and
a
creamy
almost
milky
texture
light
carbonation
and
no
unwanted
aftertaste
to
speak
of
slightly
heavy
but
an
easy
drinker
good
beer
drinkability
good
very
nice
mouthfeel
to
it
a
most
definite
easy
drinker
d
satisfying
well
brewed
but
not
awesome
its
that
brown
ale
thing
again
that
never
thrills
me
a
very
good
dark
brown
ale
almost
tastes
like
a
black
ale
to
me
nothing
to
flashy
but
for
sure
gets
the
job
done
would
definitely
take
it
over
a
newcastle
and
it
is
a
dollar
cheaper
and
has
more
alcohol
content
which
makes
it
a
little
more
hearty
not
amazingly
good
but
pretty
good
overall
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
brown
ale
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
three
beers
from
shorts
that
my
dad
brought
back
from
a
fishing
trip
up
in
michigan
and
each
one
is
quite
remarkable
looks
like
a
brewery
trip
is
in
order
d
this
is
a
really
drinkable
session
beer
that
has
great
malt
flavor
and
depth
to
it
i
would
love
to
try
his
on
cask
but
it
already
has
great
qualities
in
the
bottle
deep
mahoghany
tone
with
billowing
foam
and
some
random
spotty
lacing
toasty
malt
and
nutty
aroma
rich
and
smooth
verging
on
porter
but
not
as
roasty
very
sessionable
mild
wood
and
nutty
flavor
with
a
low
level
residual
bitterness
the
silky
smooth
body
feels
like
it
has
a
lactose
element
there
that
lends
fullness
finishes
dry
and
toasty
the
yeast
adds
a
touch
of
dried
fruit
to
the
nutty
toasted
malt
flavors
that
dominate
again
very
sessionable
with
a
distinct
fullness
for
a
brown
ale
definitely
tasty
another
winner
by
shorts
this
on
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
in
fact
i
will
make
sure
to
stock
up
on
this
for
football
season
a
great
session
beer
and
with
fall
approaching
a
brown
ale
like
this
will
be
a
great
one
to
keep
around
d
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
an
aba
bring
shorts
to
il

d
fantastic
session
beer
wish
i
had
picked
up
a
6
pack
instead
of
just
one
cant
wait
to
see
this
local
poured
a
dark
and
oily
as
a
stout
smelled
like
a
stout
tasted
like
coffee
like
a
stout
it
was
pretty
good
but
it
was
by
far
the
darkest
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
i
was
expecting
something
lighter
and
nuttier
but
maybe
i
just
dont
know
what
im
talking
about
not
what
i
expected
at
all
but
tasty
nonetheless
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
and
one
that
i
often
recommend
to
people
who
enjoy
malty
beers
expectional
brown
ale
with
a
complex
malt
arangement
without
the
heaviness
toasted
nose
of
apples
smokey
some
earth
dark
fruit
palate
is
a
wonderful
malt
character
with
sweet
caramel
and
smokey
malt
blend
without
make
acidic
conflict
good
amount
of
black
currant
mild
porter
fruit
earth
but
bright
if
possible
alcohol
is
not
detectable
pepper
dry
finish
with
a
great
body
simple
but
hits
all
the
bases
exactly
without
any
fuss
silky
smooth
beer
just
flows
down
nicely
just
a
nice
mellow
sippin
beer
my
favorite
of
shorts
offerings
d
as
far
as
basic
brown
ales
go
its
pretty
good
and
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
however
this
particular
offering
isnt
going
to
replace
bells
best
brown
at
the
top
of
my
list
anytime
soon
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
that
ive
had
in
a
while
nice
balance
between
the
american
hops
roast
and
sweetness
and
the
feel
and
drinkibility
of
this
was
great
i
need
to
bring
back
sixers
instead
of
singles
next
time
im
up
in
michigan
d
pretty
tasty
one
i
would
choose
to
session
with
if
i
did
not
have
maduro
brown
in
my
back
yard
that
being
said
a
wonderful
core
beer
from
shorts
poured
a
translucent
reddish
brown
with
decent
head
retention
the
aroma
was
sweet
tangy
chocolate
malt
almost
exclusively
like
a
bag
of
semisweet
chocolate
morsels
taste
chocolate
a
small
bit
of
espresso
some
lactose
but
mostly
chocolate
i
love
it
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
although
a
bit
one
dimensional
the
mouthfeel
is
gorgeous
thick
and
luxurious
this
is
a
lot
like
a
chocolate
milkshake
very
fine
carbonation
silky
did
i
say
thick
not
the
most
interesting
brown
ale
in
the
world
but
very
tasty
and
incredibly
solid
enjoy
without
reservation
blipped
legend
of
pat
brown
by
the
vandals
poured
a
very
nice
dark
brown
with
a
light
brown
creamy
head
the
color
is
so
dark
it
almost
appears
murky
but
upon
closer
inspection
is
actually
sparkling
clear
the
belgian
lace
is
well
formed
and
attractive
rich
malty
notes
with
hints
of
toasted
cereal
chocolate
and
nuts
smoky
restrained
yet
balanced
hops
layered
flavors
lighter
body
than
the
color
suggests
highly
refreshing
rather
moreish
a
decent
drink
but
perhaps
a
little
too
run
of
the
mill
to
be
a
repeat
purchase
talk
about
flavor
initial
sip
is
a
big
bold
mouthful
of
malty
goodness
lots
of
toasted
malt
flavor
more
brown
bread
and
coffee
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
flavorful
brown
ales
ive
had
so
much
packed
into
each
sip
wow
as
it
warms
the
flavor
just
improves
even
more
i
am
really
really
impressed
by
this
beer
brown
ales
tend
to
be
a
style
that
really
doesnt
blow
me
away
since
most
times
they
taste
relatively
similar
not
this
its
on
a
different
level
a
very
easy
going
brown
ale
that
is
not
too
light
and
not
too
strong
low
abv
makes
this
one
easy
beer
to
drink
the
bottom
line
if
youre
a
brown
ale
fan
then
this
should
be
on
your
try
list
shorts
has
put
together
a
smooth
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
that
will
likely
please
fans
of
the
style
d
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
again
just
a
good
all
around
beer
to
drink
when
im
not
in
the
mood
for
the
hop
bombs
just
overall
a
mighty
fine
beer
chestnutbrown
ale
with
a
deep
red
hue
in
the
right
light
carbonation
seems
a
bit
off
not
much
head
is
created
with
the
pour
the
aroma
is
outstanding
though
with
lots
of
complexity
roasted
coffee
might
be
the
predominant
smell
but
underneath
that
theres
hazelnut
and
a
musty
woody
character
the
taste
is
quite
complex
too
with
vanilla
oak
nuts
caramel
theres
all
sorts
of
stuff
going
on
here
everything
except
hops
overall
a
very
complex
ale
that
is
malt
forward
without
being
too
sweet
the
maltiness
is
offset
by
a
dry
finish
although
this
isnt
as
good
as
the
last
glass
i
had
on
tap
at
the
brewery
its
still
a
good
beer
and
im
enjoying
it
quite
a
bit
pours
a
lightly
hazed
dark
reddish
brown
some
orange
highlighting
thin
off
white
head
forms
quickly
settles
down
to
a
decently
sized
collar
few
spots
of
lace
stick
to
the
glass
smell
is
nice
chocolate
milk
very
nice
toastiness
biscuits
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
oats
lots
of
nuttiness
maybe
a
hint
of
dark
fruitraisin
but
mostly
very
clean
and
malty
taste
is
similar
very
nutty
caramel
toast
biscuits
raisins
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
very
bready
really
quite
earthy
nice
chocolate
malt
finish
very
dry
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
leaves
something
to
be
desired
but
is
pretty
drinkable
and
tasty
stuff
a
pretty
nice
brown
ale
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
must
say
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
smell
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
tastes
absolutely
great
caramel
and
chocolate
coming
right
through
with
a
tad
smokey
finish
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
could
drink
this
for
forever

light
to
medium
translucent

very
sweet
and
refreshing
with
only
slightest
hint
of
hops
for
balance
very
clean
and
refreshing
and
a
great
summer
beer
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
and
probably
my
favorite
sampling
from
shorts
so
far
overall
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
i
have
ever
had
and
i
have
no
issue
with
that
at
all
this
is
a
must
get
and
something
i
will
keep
as
a
staple
in
my
fridge

definitely
a
solid
solid
beer

is
probably
the
best
american
brown
ale
that
ive
had
since
surly

just
doesnt
have
that
extra
ummpfff
that
bender
does
but

a

nice
example
of
a
brown
ale
with
no
frills
amazingly
drinkable
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
or
second
favorite
brown

such
an

and
a
solid
beer
very
good
stuff
12oz
bottle
bought
in
detroit
this
week
the
beer
is
dark
translucent
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
tan
finecelled
wet
foam
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
maybe
just
a
little
fruit
or
esters
very
inviting
and
the
taste
is
much
much
richer
than
i
expected
a
sweet
malt
bomb
with
a
long
lasting
ester
flavor
thicker
than
your
normal
brown
ale
this
hits
the
spot
in
a
way
i
didnt
expect
may
be
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
completely
worth
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
sturdy
malt
profile
good
carbonation
helps
it
flow
down
easily
a
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
brown
ale
overall
i
would
enjoy
a
sixer
of
this
over
the
course
of
a
weekend
for
sure
another
solid
beer
from
shorts
overall
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
and
well
worth
a
try
great
beer
i
was
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
this
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
nice
creamy
offwhite
head
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
brown
sugar
tastes
follows
the
smell
with
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
has
full
body
and
is
nice
and
smooth
high
drinkability
and
a
great
session
beer
overall
a
fine
offering
from
shorts
another
good
impression
from
the
bottles
coming
out
of
elk
rapids
hv
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
refreshing
allinall
id
say
this
is
one
of
the
top
brown
ales
that
ive
had
im
usually
not
seeking
out
this
style
but
i
could
make
room
for
this
every
so
often
as
its
a
tasty
brew
id
put
this
up
there
with
surly
bender
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
from
shorts
d
nice
flavor
well
hidden
alcohol
low
carbonation
a
very
sessionable
brown
ale
i
just
happen
to
prefer
the
hoppiness
of
bender
best
beer
ive
had
from
shorts
loved
it
d
i
would
not
be
able
to
drink
a
ton
of
these
in
a
sitting
as
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
however
for
those
that
do
enjoy
a
good
brown
ale
i
am
sure
that
it
would
be
an
instant
classic
d
an
enjoyable
brown
it
doesnt
have
any
of
those
annoying
flavors
that
i
often
seem
to
find
in
this
style
i
will
be
getting
this
again
notes
this
beer
has
and
will
continue
to
convert
the
uneducated
masses
flat
out
well
made
beer
shorts
does
it
again
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
is
terrific
perfectly
balanced
and
enjoyable
thank
you
shorts
for
bottling
your
terrific
beers
d
this
is
remarkably
enjoyable
one
of
the
better
browns
ive
had
good
dose
of
toasted
grains
and
spicy
hops
up
front
cookie
dough
and
caramel
sweetness
follow
earthy
licorice
and
spicy
hop
bitterness
into
the
finish
doughy
malts
linger
pretty
damn
good
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
levels
a
very
nice
sessionable
american
brown
ale
oh
and
congratulations
to
the
shorts
gang
for
getting
bottles
out
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
of
this
notes
great
brown
this
is
now
my
third
and
final
shorts
brew
for
now
and
honestly
my
favorite
just
a
delicious
dark
beer
this
is
one
of
my
classic
favorites
from
joe
rich
malty
american
brown
style
with
a
bit
of
a
larger
body
than
you
might
expect
great
hop
bite
with
a
wonderful
balance
poured
a
nice
dark
malty
body
beautiful
head
and
a
nice
lacing
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
could
enjoy
any
time
if
you
havent
had
the
chance
search
out
this
or
any
of
the
shorts
beers
and
try
them
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
that
initially
put
me
off
as
i
usually
do
not
like
darker
beers
however
this
beer
was
amazingly
easy
to
drink
and
appreciate
i
rate
this
as
the
best
brown
available
it
has
subtle
hops
and
almost
a
faint
nut
quality
my
mother
in
law
who
is
not
a
beer
drinker
loves
this
also
i
will
still
go
for
the
pale
ales
but
this
is
in
the
rotation
a
nutty
entrance
leads
to
flavors
of
sweet
toffee
caramel
malt
brown
sugar
maple
syrup
and
floral
flavors
a
hop
backbone
balances
nicely
o
another
solid
beer
from
shorts
the
booziness
is
a
tad
strong
and
this
could
good
be
great
with
some
aging
nice
deep
brown
color
wow
a
lot
boozier
than
i
was
expecting
falls
pretty
flat
once
you
get
past
the
booziness
the
pecans
syrup
are
there
but
very
subtle
honestly
if
it
didnt
day
they
were
in
there
i
probably
wouldnt
have
picked
them
out
id
like
to
pick
up
another
cellar
for
a
bit
then
revisit
it
tasty
beer
smells
like
syrup
and
pecans
a
touch
boozy
right
now
less
boozy
when
first
poured
will
sit
on
a
few
bottles
and
retaste
in
a
few
months
3
495
well
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
pouring
this
on
my
pancakes
overall
another
very
nice
offering
from
shorts
i
wouldnt
mind
some
aging
to
dissipate
some
of
the
alcohol
and
may
add
to
the
mouthful
but
all
in
all
a
solid
beer
allow
it
to
get
halfway
to
room
temperature
before
sampling
color
of
black
coffee
w
3
finger
mocha
head
smell
of
malts
and
roasted
nuts
nuts
and
malts
in
the
taste
as
well
as
carmel
notes
that
get
stronger
as
you
go
and
an
oak
flavor
that
lingers
pleasantly
surprising
thick
beer
pretty
solid
and
quite
unique
glad
i
picked
up
a
sixer
o
a
decent
brown
ale
with
pecan
and
maple
characteristics
amply
expressed
o
pretty
good
but
kinda
hoping
for
more
maple
flavor
the
pecan
and
maple
do
indeed
add
to
this
beer
but
in
a
fairly
subtle
way
the
flavor
profile
is
deep
and
rich
and
includes
a
barrel
aged
quality
even
though
its
not
a
ba
beer
the
high
gravity
is
evident
but
the
alcoholic
burn
is
minimal
the
flavor
components
usually
found
in
a
porter
are
downplayed
ill
definitely
look
for
this
one
again
cheers
a
speciality
double
brown
ale
indeed
this
was
a
good
brew
in
complexity
and
experimentation
i
wish
the
maple
syrup
and
pecans
were
pulled
out
more
however
this
is
a
balanced
brown
ale
that
offers
a
bit
of
dry
and
sweet
perfect
for
the
colder
months

delicious
little

in

a
slightly
heavy
ale
which
i
was
expecting
but
a
little
more
than
expected
i
suppose
what
compensates
for
the
heaviness
is
the
slight
sweetness
the
maple
syrup
brings
to
the
mix
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
friends
and
partake

more

maple

present
missing
that
strong
pecan
flavor
though
will
age
the
remaining
bottles
o
this
is
one
flavorful
brown
ale
it
gives
me
a
nice
warming
sensation
on
a
chilly
fall
day
it
is
perfect
for
todays
weather
o
quite
enjoyable
excellent
blend
of
flavors
that
complement
each
other
well
this
has
become
my
favorite
shorts
offering
which
says
a
lot
not
too
sweet
not
too
carbonated
and
not
too
complex
they
really
hit
a
home
run
with
this
one
highly
recommended
overall
first
offering
from
shorts
and
i
guess
i
would
say
it
is
just
ok
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
despite
its
fairly
high
abv
but
just
too
sweet
and
a
bit
off
balance
i
like
the
uniqueness
of
the
nut
flavor
with
the
sweetness
overall
a
nice
woodsy
brown
ale
where
i
wish
the
maple
was
a
bit
more
pronounced
not
a
bad
beer
but
probably
a
victim
of
shorts
overall
quality
i
do
not
think
the
flavors
burst
here
as
much
as
they
do
with
other
shorts
beers
i
would
get
this
again
but
there
are
others
in
the
brand
i
would
go
to
first
highly
recommended
a
great
drinker
even
at
9
5
lots
of
unique
aromas
and
flavors
thanks
abanton
for
spreading
the
shorts
wealth
woodmasters
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
i
just
find
it
to
be
a
bit
too
sweet
wanted
more
of
a
maple
flavor
and
a
little
less
of
the
maple
sweetness
and
the
alcohol
comes
through
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
this
pours
a
ruddy
dark
caramel
brown
color
with
very
light
thin
foam
theres
a
light
aroma
defined
by
some
sweet
maple
notes
and
a
touch
of
mild
caramel
malt
the
flavor
has
a
pronounced
bitterness
that
is
appealing
contrast
to
malt
sweetness
along
with
some
maple
notes
theres
some
pecan
on
the
finish
but
it
doesnt
draw
undue
attention
to
itself
i
get
some
heat
but
its
on
the
mellow
side
that
said
i
felt
the
abv
before
i
noticed
it
i
enjoy
boozy
olde
ales
and
this
one
aged
a
year
is
definitely
one
of
my
favs
i
enjoy
it
fresh
as
well
but
the
year
makes
it
a
much
more
complex
beer
considering
the
high
bar
set
by
most
shorts
beers
this
was
a
disappointment
a
few
months
or
more
of
ageing
though
might
smooth
out
the
flavors
and
improve
it
pretty
tasty
beer
unfortunately
i
think
the
alcoholic
body
masks
some
of
the
flavors
a
bit
and
if
that
were
toned
down
a
little
this
beer
would
be
pretty
damn
good
overall
this
beer
was
below
average
to
me
by
shorts
standards
i
dont
see
myself
buying
it
again
anytime
soon
but
it
may
be
worth
trying
for
the
odd
experience
it
embodies
alone
m
the
maple
syrup
and
pecan
are
a
good
combination
nutty
and
sweet
spicy
brown
sugar
and
raisins
add
to
the
wall
of
flavor
damned
this
one
held
up
well
o
not
that
great
as
the
sourness
dominates
the
malty
backbone
helps
but
not
enough
to
make
it
great
overall
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
than
what
this
was
a
brown
ale
brewed
with
maple
syrup
and
toasted
pecans
should
be
a
pretty
robust
beer
not
what
i
imagined
but
not
not
horrible
either
if
i
did
not
read
the
label
i
would
not
have
noticed
or
been
looking
for
maple
and
pecan
flavors
o
i
did
not
like
this
beer
all
that
much
it
seems
to
be
a
bit
too
sweet
and
nutty
with
a
massive
amount
of
carbonation

super
hoppy
balance
from
cellared
beer
twin
of
previous
review
still
4
5
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
ive
had
much
better
from
shorts
my
anticipation
going
into
it
was
that
i
it
would
be
much
sweeter
however
the
herbal
woody
taste
although
not
bad
really
surprised
me
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
but
was
glad
i
tried
it
o
i
love
all
of
the
flavors
presented
i
just
dont
have
much
of
a
sweet
tooth
this
is
just
too
rich
for
me
like
the
beer
equivalent
of
pecan
pie
or
somesuch
certainly
worth
a
turn
of
the
head
though
delicious
doesnt
over
do
it
on
the
maple
its
understated
but
present
throughout
nice
winter
beer
overall
i
was
kind
of
excited
to
try
this
then
reviews
of
bozzyness
let
me
down
a
bit
finally
the
confirm
that
it
taste
boozy
really
sucks
so
far
my
least
favorite
shorts
beer
i
guess
to
do
an
imperial
brown
ale
with
this
high
abv
then
avoid
boozy
flavors
is
impossible
hrmmm
an
interesting
beer
this
would
be
a
great
beer
if
it
were
not
for
the
boozy
fusel
alcohols
with
limit
its
drinkability
and
if
it
were
a
touch
less
sweet
and
lower
alcohol
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
quite
bold
and
shows
hints
of
the
character
and
ingredients
displayed
on
the
bottle
however
the
description
sounds
better
than
this
brew
tastes
i
think
if
the
alcohol
was
toned
down
there
could
be
more
focus
on
the
flavoring
without
it
getting
caught
up
in
all
the
alcohol
character
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
an
above
average
beer
and
a
pretty
good
american
brown
ale
that
was
quite
unique
for
its
style
and
it
fit
the
winter
months
nicely
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
i
could
go
for
another
one
but
after
that
i
think
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
percentage
would
start
to
get
to
me
but
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
with
not
too
much
alcohol
showing
up
for
9
5
beer
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
aroma
they
were
both
just
about
as
good
as
it
gets
i
could
smell
this
beer
all
day
thats
how
good
the
aroma
was
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
how
the
body
felt
a
little
thin
and
watery
and
how
the
taste
wasnt
as
robust
and
complex
as
the
aroma
i
will
for
sure
buy
this
again
if
it
is
released
next
year
i
am
glad
i
went
back
and
got
a
six
pack
this
beer
is
worth
giving
a
try
if
your
are
a
fan
of
nutty
brown
ales
this
one
stands
out
instead
of
blending
into
the
crowd
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
like
the
complexity
that
the
maple
syrup
and
pecans
added
it
was
just
enough
to
make
for
a
good
flavor
and
great
aroma
without
feeling
overdone
shorts
really
did
a
good
job
on
this
beer
it
seems
like
they
have
a
special
gift
for
knowing
exactly
what
added
ingredients
work
best
with
what
styles
to
make
for
a
truly
unique
and
memorable
beer
and
to
me
thats
what
shorts
does
best
they
make
memorable
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
great
job
guys
mouthfeel
taste
the
alcohol
but
its
balanced
medium
body
and
carbonation
d
and
o
nice
beer
the
nose
is
really
the
showcase
after
that
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
a
really
nice
brown
ale
i
wouldnt
put
that
up
there
with
the
good
humans
from
shorts
but
close
both
imperial
browns
but
on
their
own
different
side
of
the
spectrum
o
this
beer
is
nothing
special
i
has
high
hopes
based
on
the
label
description
but
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
considering
its
from
shorts
id
like
to
try
this
beer
again
in
the
future
but
not
from
a
bottle
o
another
adventurous
shorts
idea
this
one
worked
the
nuttiness
is
perfectly
balanced
with
our
beloved
traditional
ingredients
and
the
maple
syrup
sweetens
it
well
hiding
the
alcohol
and
bringing
in
flavors
reminiscent
of
the
smell
of
a
candy
shop
the
richness
strength
and
oiliness
make
it
a
sipper
but
this
is
good
because
the
complex
aftertaste
is
as
enjoyable
as
any
i
can
remember
pure
pecan
and
maple
indeed
woody
dark
brown
color
translucent
with
a
half
a
finger
head
with
small
bubbles
smells
of
nuts
chocolate
maple
syrup
and
malt
taste
is
nutty
chocolatey
slightly
coffee
and
i
get
very
little
maple
syrup
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavy
side
and
is
carbonated
lightly
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
will
seek
this
out
every
year
a
great
winter
warmer
if
you
were
never
able
to
get
cashew
mountain
brown
this
one
ranks
right
up
there
with
it
in
my
opinion
i
would
love
to
see
this
one
barrelaged
o
while
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
smell
its
a
pretty
interesting
brown
ale
its
sweetness
and
abv
certainly
doesnt
make
it
a
session
beer
for
me
but
i
dont
mind
it
overall
a
great
brown
ale
with
a
little
kick
a
true
winter
warmer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
encourage
you
to
give
it
a
try
overall
way
too
much
alcohol
i
would
have
liked
the
more
complex
flavors
to
have
room
to
shine
oh
well
mouthfeel
full
bodied
a
little
cloying
minor
carbonation
got
an
old
english
barleywine
like
feel
but
the
cloying
has
a
bit
of
wood
residue
likeness
which
im
not
digging
overall
i
really
dig
this
brew
it
was
a
little
tarty
at
first
but
its
really
growing
on
me
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
fresh
and
see
how
well
the
flavors
have
changed
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
brown
ale
lots
of
spices
are
evident
on
the
first
pass
through
and
this
is
more
or
less
to
be
expected
nice
notes
of
cinnamon
spiced
apple
and
pear
and
a
touch
of
nutmeg
there
was
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
mixed
in
with
caramel
and
a
roasted
nice
like
smell
coming
off
it
as
it
warmed
deep
underling
grain
and
malt
base
was
apparent
as
well
very
sweet
and
entirely
malt
driven
this
was
not
terrible
just
underwhelming
good
bit
of
spice
added
in
and
a
nice
bitter
hop
driven
finish
o
dear
shorts
learn
how
to
bottle
a
fucking
brown
ale
without
it
going
sour
o
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
am
not
sure
how
much
i
like
or
dislike
this
beer
in
this
moment
the
bitterness
is
weird
to
me
but
the
after
flavor
is
chocolaty
and
nutty
and
nice
d
drinkability
is
high
a
noticeable
pecan
flavor
mixed
with
maple
syrup
is
a
recipe
for
success
while
not
an
everyday
drinker
for
sure
this
would
be
great
in
the
dead
of
winter
much
like
the
label
depicts
but
i
also
didnt
mind
drinking
this
one
in
june
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
short
stubby
offwhite
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
galaxy
swirl
on
top
the
nose
brings
some
light
cherries
and
molasses
along
with
some
brown
sugar
and
sweetened
malt
also
a
bit
nutty
the
flavor
has
a
decent
amount
of
maple
and
brown
sugar
plus
some
light
nutty
character
mild
toffee
and
caramel
plus
a
bit
of
light
cherry
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
quite
chewy
nothing
too
great
about
this
though
not
bad
either
overall
ehhh
its
ok
overall
pretty
good
creamy
and
a
bit
syrupy
though
which
seems
weird
but
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
interesting
malts
good
fruits
nuts
maple
syrupy
and
all
those
flavors
add
a
weird
light
sour
tart
flavor
a
bit
boozy
but
designed
for
that
i
think
a
big
beer
d
too
hot
for
me
to
have
another
or
even
want
to
finish
12
oz
i
wont
buy
again
overall
this
beer
is
like
crystal
meth
might
be
fun
to
try
once
but
certainly
bot
something
i
will
be
looking
for
in
the
future
but
hey
whatever
this
is
simply
an
excellent
beer
that
pushes
boundaries
in
every
direction
a
showcase
of
shorts
at
its
best
shorts
beers
are
always
worth
a
try
sometimes
i
find
a
unique
and
amazing
beer
sometime
not
so
much
woodmaster
was
one
i
opened
with
great
anticipation
im
a
huge
fan
of
michigan
flavors
cherries
blueberries
maple
syrup
and
this
beer
boasts
maple
syrup
in
the
description
ive
had
a
lot
of
maple
syrup
beers
that
frankly
should
have
left
the
maple
syrup
out
of
their
name
shorts
typically
can
nail
the
flavors
they
boast
in
their
beer
but
like
many
other
maple
syrup
beers
woodmaster
fell
short
its
a
good
brown
ale
but
nothing
exceptional
tastes
like
many
other
craft
brew
brown
ales
that
use
dark
brown
sugar
or
molasses
but
lacks
distinct
maple
syrup
flavor
beware
of
any
of
shorts
beers
in
a
bottle
fuller
medium
body
sticky
and
creamy
decent
carbonation
pretty
nice
flavor
i
like
the
integration
of
syrup
and
nuts
to
the
brown
ale
although
it
didnt
seem
to
completely
mesh
together
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
nice
rings
of
lace
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
hearty
bread
roasted
nuts
and
maple
there
is
also
a
funky
gym
socks
smell
that
ruins
everything
i
think
this
bottle
may
be
infected
taste
confirms
the
infection
this
is
a
sour
beer
on
first
sip
but
i
can
taste
the
malty
bread
flavor
roasted
nuts
and
slight
maple
syrup
the
infection
issue
is
awful
when
combined
with
these
flavors
carbonation
level
is
average
overall
i
bet
this
is
a
really
good
beer
when
its
normal
but
this
was
definitely
infected
not
sure
what
went
wrong
here
bottle
was
maybe
old
the
beer
flat
out
sucks
id
like
to
say
i
would
try
it
again
but
if
it
never
crosses
my
lips
im
fine
with
that
outcome
too
for
sure
an
avoid
at
all
costs
o
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
it
definitely
leaves
a
bunch
of
the
typical
brown
ale
considerations
behind
in
favor
of
the
experimentation
with
the
maple
flavorings
good
but
not
great
o
seems
a
bit
odd
and
disjointed
in
the
end
interesting
but
not
what
i
would
call
pleasant
i
have
to
wonder
whats
intentional
here
and
whats
not
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
beer
theres
much
better
in
the
style
so
not
amazing
but
decent
not
worth
hunting
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
think
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
id
like
to
try
it
again
because
i
think
it
has
potential
gfunk
drinkable
nah
not
really

d
i
like
me
some
brown
ales
and
this
is
a
good
one
all
the
best
qualities
of
a
brown
and
some
interesting
additives
to
keep
it
fresh
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
for
a
9
5
and
a
medium
to
light
carbonation
which
seems
about
right
for
the
style
overall
a
very
good
brown
ale
overall
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
the
best
buy
something
i
have
drank
since
and
will
drink
again
the
cpj
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
and
slightly
slick
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkabilty
was
pretty
good
actually
things
came
together
pretty
well
in
it
i
liked
both
the
nutty
pecans
and
the
sweeter
syrup
in
it
pretty
cool
and
good
beer
overall
overall

d
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
another
one
right
afterwords
but
im
convinced
ill
revisit
some
day
another
interesting
but
solid
brew
from
shorts
pours
a
pretty
maroonish
brown
a
bit
of
head
and
highly
carbonated
it
really
looks
pretty
darn
good
smells
malty
and
sweet
there
is
a
hint
of
something
bitter
on
the
nose
that
is
a
bit
off
but
overall
smells
like
a
decent
brown
ale
taste
however
is
a
different
store
something
is
seriously
off
here
i
cant
tell
if
its
intensional
or
not
sharp
bitterness
on
the
tongue
some
serious
maltiness
that
would
be
good
if
not
for
the
off
flavours
the
beer
is
thick
and
creamy
almost
and
tastes
pretty
good
but
its
seriously
got
osmething
funky
going
on
that
isnt
very
good
i
think
shorts
missed
on
this
one
the
booziness
and
availability
might
make
this
rank
a
little
lower
but
its
such
a
solid
beer
and
will
get
again
if
i
have
the
opportunity
well
the
woodmaster
certainly
isnt
sessionable
but
it
is
a
beer
that
i
enjoy
greatly
the
two
imperial
browns
that
i
have
had
from
shorts
this
and
good
humans
have
both
been
standouts
and
i
am
impressed
with
how
different
the
two
taste
while
still
remaining
pretty
similar
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
am
surprised
by
how
good
it
is
every
time
that
i
drink
it
up
for
review
is
a
750ml
bottle
of
the
woodmaster
from
shorts
brewing
company
poured
into
a
snifter
at
cellar
temp
pours
mahogany
tan
head
notes
of
pecans
strawberry
fruit
malts
oak
and
booze
nice
creamy
body
very
nice
could
use
more
time
to
mellow
out
thanks
to
hurfer
for
the
extra
poured
from
12oz
bottle
no
date
into
snifter
glass
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
with
hints
of
amber
around
the
edges
and
a
small
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
linger
long
and
leaves
only
a
swirl
along
the
top
with
no
lacing
the
maple
syrup
is
abundantly
evident
in
the
aroma
which
is
very
sweet
overall
with
caramel
and
toffee
coming
through
as
well
there
are
hints
of
both
the
nuts
and
some
booze
which
stings
the
nose
slightly
i
think
i
would
describe
the
taste
as
a
slightly
more
abrasive
version
of
the
nose
its
got
the
maple
syrup
which
sticks
to
the
palate
along
with
the
alcohol
which
makes
its
presence
felt
in
the
finish
especially
the
overall
character
is
slightly
toasty
with
the
pecans
showing
up
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
no
surprisingly
syrupy
and
get
almost
cloying
with
the
big
maple
syrup
presence
the
body
is
pretty
heavy
because
of
that
and
the
carbonation
is
pretty
light
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
imperial
series
and
the
sweetness
is
enough
to
limit
the
drinkability
as
i
respect
the
originality
of
this
style
it
just
isnt
my
style
thick
and
coating
almost
oily
feeling
mouthfeel
matches
the
flavors
well
a
beast
of
a
beer
and
delicious
well
done
very
drinkable
and
has
a
great
mouthfeel
it
is
like
drinking
waffles
with
nuts
and
godiva
on
them
amazing
unique
brew
and
the
best
thing
shorts
has
ever
done
in
my
opinion
such
a
beautiful
beer
mouthfeel
almost
is
pretty
viscous
nice
for
a
beer
like
this
i
just
wish
this
beast
tasted
as
good
as
it
smelled
d
a
bit
boozy
and
sweet
so
it
makes
for
a
sipper
i
imagine
this
will
age
pretty
well
drinkability
as
with
all
of
shorts
beers
i
have
honestly
never
been
able
to
taste
the
alcohol
this
for
being
so
high
in
abv
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
i
can
see
why
kevin
has
spoke
about
this
beer
in
the
past
well
done
shorts
d
due
to
the
high
gravity
of
this
beer
for
a
brown
ale
it
is
not
easy
drinking
overall
i
just
cant
get
by
the
overwhelming
bourbon
and
alcohol
flavors
they
are
really
overwhelming
and
overpower
all
the
other
flavors
every
bit
of
the
9
4
abv
is
present
drinkability
12oz
was
plenty
the
sweetness
of
the
maple
syrup
definitely
make
this
a
slow
drinker
but
is
very
tasty
thankfully
the
nut
and
malt
notes
do
help
cut
a
bit
of
the
sweetness
the
high
abv
is
totally
hidden
i
must
say
that
at
nearly
10
this
is
very
drinkable
a
solid
offering
at
an
interesting
recipe
overall
a
perfect
cold
weather
companion
while
enjoying
a
real
wood
fire
crackling
in
the
fireplace
the
snow
is
flying
outside
as
i
type
on
my
macbook
and
with
this
beer
sitting
on
the
end
table
im
doing
just
fine
glad
i
bought
more
than
one
or
id
be
completely
bummed
bittersweet
and
creamy
yummy
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
quite
sweet
and
as
such
serves
as
more
of
a
one
and
done
selection
or
dessert
beer
or
night
cap
well
worth
a
try
a
perfect
winter
selection
to
enjoy
whilst
bundled
up
in
flannel
in
front
of
a
nice
fire
a
great
version
of
a
nut
brown
of
imperial
status
d
its
a
great
cold
weather
drinker
with
the
warm
alcohol
and
flavors
of
fallwinter
nuts
and
maple
syrup
it
took
a
lot
of
will
power
to
let
it
warm
a
bit
for
a
full
experience
something
id
buy
again
glad
i
took
the
suggestion
from
the
beer
guy
at
peters
imports
ddefinite
sipper
pretty
rich
in
taste
woodmaster
is
mediumbodied
and
feels
creamy
pretty
good
for
a
brown
ale
not
too
spicy
good
balance
and
decent
drinkability
the
abv
may
be
up
there
like
a
lot
of
shorts
brew
and
not
listed
like
all
shorts
cool
artwork
on
the
label
so
far
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
tried
from
shorts
this
is
highly
recommended
and
a
beer
this
good
makes
me
proud
that
people
who
are
local
to
me
made
this
great
brew
having
heard
that
this
is
a
limited
release
i
strongly
suggest
you
try
this
one
before
it
runs
out
d
one
is
enough
for
me
ill
keep
a
6
pack
for
a
time
to
see
how
this
ages
to
my
mind
this
beer
seems
outstanding
in
many
respects
from
its
bold
and
synergistic
flavors
lovely
aroma
and
color
to
its
high
abv
this
beer
has
a
lot
to
offer
i
imagine
this
would
be
a
nice
drink
to
share
with
those
who
may
have
yet
to
develop
a
palate
for
craft
brews
as
this
showcases
quite
nicely
flavors
that
most
folks
may
already
know
and
appreciate
and
on
cold
winter
nights
sitting
around
a
nice
fire
with
friends
or
a
loved
one
this
would
be
a
winner
for
certain
imo
maybe
even
as
compliment
to
pancakes
bacon
and
eggs
for
breakfast
for
those
vacation
days
i
also
find
the
whimsical
artwork
on
the
bottle
brings
yet
another
dimension
of
enjoyment
to
the
beverage
in
shorts
a
brilliant
beer
this
might
not
be
as
drinkable
as
a
standard
brown
ale
but
it
is
much
more
drinkable
than
many
other
beers
of
its
size
and
malt
character
when
i
smelled
this
and
got
all
that
malt
in
my
nose
i
figured
it
would
be
a
sipper
but
the
nuttiness
on
the
end
helps
it
go
down
faster
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
i
like
that
i
can
taste
everything
that
was
put
into
this
ale
and
would
be
pleased
if
it
worked
its
way
into
a
regular
winter
bottling
rotation
d
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
great
it
has
a
good
balance
to
it
as
a
deep
flavor
profile
this
is
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
and
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
enjoy
it
i
cant
wait
until
my
next
trip
the
shorts
brewpub
reviewed
on
6292010
on
tap
at
shorts
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
with
barely
any
head
aroma
of
sweet
nutty
malt
flavor
of
maple
but
not
so
much
maple
sugar
nutty
pecan
also
a
strange
saltiness
mushrooms
not
overly
sugary
or
malty
as
i
was
expecting
still
it
didnt
quite
sit
right
with
me
an
interesting
beer
to
try
but
id
suggest
a
small
sample
another
dangerously
drinkable
beer
from
shorts
a
hefty
beer
which
will
really
sneak
up
on
you
a
couple
pints
would
probably
be
my
limit
but
i
would
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
those
pints
excellent
beer
and
a
privilege
to
drink
growler
picked
up
at
the
pub
dark
brown
with
tan
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
nutty
taste
is
very
sweet
maple
syrup
up
front
fading
into
roasted
pecans
the
mix
of
the
two
makes
you
think
of
a
great
pancake
breakfast
for
9
5
abv
this
has
excellent
drinkabilty
interesting
and
worth
trying
d
an
interesting
beer
and
fun
to
try
best
in
small
quantities
how
is
a
beer
of
9
5
abv
so
damn
drinkable
its
scary
in
a
way
as
this
is
a
sipper
so
make
sure
you
have
a
friend
or
two
to
share
the
bottle
with
or
not
the
maple
syrup
does
add
a
good
amount
of
depth
as
well
as
the
pecans
even
though
they
stay
a
little
vague
vite
estreme
della
birra
semihazy
dark
amber
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
collar
toasted
pecans
leap
out
of
the
glass
slightly
overwhelming
the
toasted
malt
foundation
maple
syrup
is
noticeable
on
a
lesser
level
lending
only
a
touch
of
sweetness
toasted
pecans
and
maple
follow
through
on
the
palate
though
its
not
especially
sweet
flavors
of
toast
and
roasted
malt
are
stronger
midpalate
along
with
moderate
bitterness
this
is
enjoyable
but
i
find
myself
wishing
it
were
less
attenuated
to
balance
the
slightly
chalky
and
astringent
character
of
the
nuts
the
finish
is
dry
and
lightly
bitter
with
a
lingering
nutty
aftertaste
pretty
good
a
different
yeast
something
with
more
of
an
english
ale
character
would
have
made
this
more
enjoyable
beer
is
sweet
and
has
a
liquor
like
quality
to
it
a
rather
strong
liquor
like
quality
bourbon
almost
i
guess
the
point
of
this
beer
is
to
taste
like
bourbon
congratulations
you
did
it
you
really
did
drinkability
is
fine
mouthfeel
is
fine
i
guess
its
an
ok
beer
but
not
a
repeat
for
me
quite
sweet
but
probably
the
most
maple
ive
had
in
a
beer
the
nuts
are
quite
subdued
at
this
point
as
well
and
a
mild
tartness
seems
to
be
developing
d
damn
we
loved
this
beer
so
rich
and
earthy
hopefully
this
becomes
easier
to
find
in
the
future
d
it
wasnt
awful
but
i
didnt
care
much
for
it
one
of
the
weaker
shorts
beers
i
have
had
though
i
love
and
commend
their
experimental
side
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
neat
depth
another
interesting
brew
from
a
fine
brewery
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
smooth
going
down
this
is
nice
stuff
thanks
randy
rich
and
tasty
unique
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
think
the
age
has
changed
the
beer
quite
a
bit
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
fresh
hint
hint
shorts
the
smell
comes
very
close
to
meeting
expectations
a
very
nice
toasted
pecan
scent
matches
well
with
the
maple
syrup
used
both
of
which
carry
over
well
into
the
taste
and
are
met
with
a
light
sweet
chocolate
flavor
unfortunately
some
of
the
bitterness
of
a
pour
or
aged
brown
ale
is
showing
in
the
aftertaste
all
in
all
another
great
offering
from
shorts
well
done
men
d
good
unique
which
is
a
trend
in
the
shorts
imperial
series
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
falls
a
little
short
on
this
as
well
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
overall
i
think
this
had
a
little
too
much
age
on
it
all
of
the
flavors
had
mellowed
and
i
dont
beleive
this
is
what
joe
intended
this
beer
to
taste
like
would
have
really
liked
to
try
it
fresh
and
compare
but
i
am
reviewing
this
bottle
so
i
am
not
impressed
skal
pours
brown
in
color
a
little
translucency
around
the
edges
smell
is
some
light
dark
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
roasted
malts
theres
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
good
beer
theres
even
more
alcohol
showing
up
in
the
nose
once
this
gets
a
chance
to
warm
up
another
absolutely
incredible
beer
from
shorts
wonderful
beer
from
a
wonderful
brewery
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
imperial
series
pretty
high
bar
and
the
sweetness
is
enough
to
limit
the
drinkability
overall
its
a
tasty
brown
and
definitely
better
than
most
just
not
quite
as
good
as
most
of
the
other
shorts
beers
ive
had
medium
body
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
this
was
wonderful
brew
and
a
gem
in
a
great
series
of
beers
from
shorts
the
last
of
the
imperial
series
for
me
and
it
just
leaves
me
wanting
more
so
give
me
more
joe
drinkability
overall
this
brew
isnt
bad
it
just
has
two
things
about
it
that
i
dont
necessarily
appreciate
in
a
beer
the
metallic
grape
thing
and
the
cloying
aspect
big
turn
offs
for
this
guy
i
do
appreciate
what
joe
was
going
for
in
this
beer
though
and
i
wonder
if
more
of
the
nuttiness
would
have
showed
fresh
either
way
thanks
for
the
opportunity
derek
taste
starts
with
semisweet
cookie
dough
malt
with
a
woody
edge
graham
cracker
mixes
with
light
fruit
notes
subtle
vinegar
and
tart
cherries
flemish
red
or
oud
bruin
throughout
woody
nutty
pecans
with
maple
syrup
and
a
faint
smokiness
in
the
finish
lingering
vinegar
and
cherry
pits
mediumbodied
with
a
smooth
feel
i
didnt
expect
this
to
be
so
flemish
reminds
me
of
goudenband
great
feel
but
its
a
tough
beer
to
drink
and
drink
great
for
sharing
and
another
from
the
creative
mind
of
joe
short
another
unique
delicious
beer
from
shorts
i
cant
get
enough
of
their
beer
the
maple
syrup
and
pecans
in
this
beer
really
set
it
apart
from
other
nut
browns
not
to
mention
the
big
abv
thanks
again
for
the
treat
derek
thanks
hoppymeal
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
rich
mahogany
with
a
fluffy
two
finger
tan
colored
head
that
slowly
dies
down
lots
of
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
of
the
glass
a
nice
wall
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
sides
very
interesting
aroma
of
sausage
young
maple
syrup
and
toasted
pecans
caramel
malt
and
cane
sugars
dominate
the
nose
as
well
smokey
wood
scents
here
and
there
too
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
but
has
an
interesting
spicelike
sting
to
it
along
with
brown
sugar
and
molasses
aftertaste
has
a
toasted
nut
flavor
with
a
weak
pancake
sweetness
that
dries
the
mouth
just
not
digging
the
flavor
to
be
honest
probably
because
its
nothing
like
ive
ever
had
before
mouthfeel
is
warm
and
medium
bodied
with
a
constant
carbonation
drinkability
suffers
because
of
the
over
the
top
sweetness
bottle
should
definitely
be
shared
i
could
see
people
that
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
really
dislike
this
beer
as
for
me
im
just
about
in
the
middle
congratulations
to
shorts
for
being
pioneers
in
the
extreme
beer
movement
thanks
again
derek
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
try
this
truly
unqiue
beer
ultra
malty
smooth
and
medium
bodied
overall
theres
a
twinge
of
alcohol
under
the
maple
goodness
which
slows
you
down
some
but
its
not
distracting
very
creative
and
highly
recommended
drinkability
is
aided
by
great
taste
and
abv
feel
appropriately
carbonated
hard
for
me
to
get
over
the
taste
pours
the
color
and
thickness
or
thin
of
black
plain
coffe
head
dissipates
quick
smells
hoppy
tastes
hoppy
for
a
brown
ale
but
i
think
it
was
supposed
to
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
overall
a
welldone
version
of
a
hoppy
brown
ale
overall
solid
if
not
really
interesting
one
of
the
best
brews
from
shorts
i
really
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
brown
ales
potent
this
one
has
grown
on
me
surprisingly
bitter
for
only
19
ibu
im
a
hop
head
so
i
love
this
dry
hopped
take
on
a
brown
ale
my
new
favorite
brown
ale
dark
brown
pour
ruby
red
where
the
light
passes
through
on
the
edges
with
a
thin
soapy
head
aroma
of
brown
sugar
chocolate
and
even
a
little
bourbon
tastes
like
brown
bread
with
raisins
very
light
coffee
roast
bitterness
warm
fairly
boozy
finish
pretty
good
for
a
brown
ale
but
brown
ales
arent
really
the
greatest
to
begin
with
12
ounce
bottle
into
tulip
glass
bottled
on
10222013
pours
slightly
hazy
ruby
brown
color
with
a
12
finger
dense
light
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
around
the

lemon

caramel

brown

with
moderate

with
good

and
zero
cloying

after
the

medium

and
mediumfull

with
a
moderately
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
imperial
brown
ale
all
around
good
balance
complexity
and
robustness
of
darkroast
malt
and
moderate
hop
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
decent
beer
nothing
bad
nothing
great
would
drink
again
bu
wouldnt
seek
out
this
is
an
odd
beer
which
i
suppose
shouldnt
surprise
me
from
shorts
its
like
they
throw
all
kinds
of
stuff
in
a
blender
to
see
if
it
works
and
if
it
doesnt
work
they
throw
some
other
stuff
in
a
blender
occasionally
they
get
hits
but
often
they
get
oddballs
like
this
one
ya
feel
me
my
peeps
ogood
dry
hopped
brown
ale
could
use
more
complexity
overall
i
like
the
hint
of
sweetness
and
i
wish
there
was
more
of
it
i
dont
like
the
hops
and
roasty
malt
combination
outside
of
stouts
also
a
little
bit
weak
on
flavor
for
so
strong
of
alcohol
o
this
is
a
phenomenal
brown
that
may
become
a
sixpack
purchase
for
me
in
the
future
outstanding
well
done
thank
you
shorts
stay
tuned
for
more
reviews
yet
to
come
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
color
of
slightly
dark
chocolate
perfect
mouthfeel
not
highly
carbonated
but
by
no
mean
thin
or
flat
this
is
hoppier
than
most
browns
ive
had
but
its
not
overdone
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
the
hops
and
a
mild
combo
of
brown
sugar
and
caramel
i
saw
the
ratings
here
and
didnt
have
high
expectations
but
this
definitely
surpasses
them
o
nothing
too
special
here
basically
its
just
a
decent
easy
drinking
brown
ale
the
does
a
good
job
of
belying
its
alcohol
content
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
id
gladly
kill
this
six
pack
with
minimal
effort
o
this
is
a
really
impressive
double
brown
ale
it
is
a
must
try
overall
pretty
decent
im
not
sure
when
shorts
comes
to
boston
but
i
always
catch
them
months
later
with
a
few
straggling
singles
in
a
liquor
store
i
haunt
too
infrequently
as
of
late
so
when
i
see
it
i
grab
it
not
a
typical
brown
and
pretty
decent
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
sure
isnt
anything
exciting
glad
i
tried
it
once
but
i
wont
seek
another
out
quintessentially
forgettable
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
good
humans
is
a
deep
amberbrown
color
with
a
very
thin
cream
colored
head
nose
is
surprisingly
malt
forward
with
hops
being
barely
discernible
malt
nose
includes
chocolate
caramel
roasted
coffee
and
toasted
bread
hops
come
through
much
more
in
the
flavor
but
are
still
only
to
balance
the
strong
malty
backbone
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
with
a
velvety
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
could
be
a
little
stronger
on
the
hops
but
definitely
solid
overall
a
nice
aba
from
a
brewery
that
comes
to
boston
a
few
months
of
the
year
yeah
im
happy
with
this
one
too
thanks
to
drewshal9
for
the
trade
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
had
recalled
earlier
tastes
of
this
beer
having
a
pronounced
hop
component
when
i
first
tasted
this
particular
good
humans
i
got
a
ton
of
chocolate
and
hop
significant
hops
as
i
mentioned
earlier
once
i
finished
a
third
of
the
beer
the
hops
made
their
presence
known
this
is
one
on
the
more
enjoyable
beers
that
i
have
had
from
shorts
o
an
interesting
variation
on
a
brown
ale
but
not
necessarily
something
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
again
overall
not
bad
im
surprised
by
this
one
the
shorts
normal
beers
dont
seem
to
do
anything
special
and
are
usually
fairly
lackluster
and
i
wasnt
expecting
a
dry
hopped
brown
ale
to
do
anything
nice
but
this
is
well
balanced
not
too
bitter
nice
profile
of
both
hops
and
malts
that
seem
to
somehow
play
off
each
other
since
i
think
they
picked
the
hops
and
malts
well
o
this
beer
is
hot
and
boozy
in
my
opinion
i
usually
feel
brown
ales
are
easy
drinking
and
smooth
as
this
one
seems
to
be
but
its
just
slightly
on
the
boozy
side
not
one
to
gravitate
to
but
one
i
liked
at
one
point
for
some
reason
this
bottle
is
not
doing
it
for
me
better
luck
next
time
cheers
12oz
bottle
deep
amber
with
a
frothy
light
mocha
head
this
retains
with
a
creamy
richness
leaving
sticky
swathes
of
lacing
behind
the
aroma
smells
leafy
with
green
citrus
cocoa
and
roast
all
mixing
together
to
give
the
nose
a
fresh
ripe
twang
the
taste
is
fresh
ripe
citrus
with
a
firm
bitterness
at
its
core
tropical
and
herbal
notes
hang
on
the
edges
while
a
malty
backbone
of
cocoa
sweetness
and
roast
flavor
that
leave
a
touch
of
char
lingering
in
the
finish
along
with
some
leftover
green
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
firm
creaminess
that
spreads
out
this
is
pretty
easy
going
in
the
mouth
overall
with
just
a
touch
of
warmth
to
the
proceedings
this
was
a
more
than
serviceable
take
on
the
hoppy
brown
ale
style
with
a
good
bit
more
going
on
with
it
than
i
expected
the
really
easy
drinkability
for
8
helped
as
well
glad
i
picked
a
bottle
up
the
mix
of
hops
and
brown
ale
malts
works
for
me
but
the
malt
flavors
actually
are
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
a
good
hazelnutty
leathery
and
caramel
cocoa
feel
to
them
good
stuff
o
i
love
unique
beers
and
this
didnt
disappoint
i
dont
really
like
brown
ales
but
i
dig
anything
that
highlights
hops
this
is
a
beer
that
is
great
to
try
but
i
cant
see
buying
a
6
pack
great
beer
very
unique
enjoyable
thanks
shorts
this
is
a
dry
hopped
double
brown
ale
which
to
me
means
a
lot
of
different
things
in
one
bottle
its
complex
and
enjoyable
but
its
hard
to
get
a
grip
on
everything
going
on
in
each
sip
maybe
thats
a
good
thing
well
done
shorts
a
unique
as
hell
brown
ale
really
tastes
like
it
was
blended
with
an
ipa
and
it
has
a
flavor
im
not
sure
ill
find
in
another
brown
ale
good
humans
has
an
aroma
that
id
like
to
forget
im
not
sure
why
im
smelling
what
i
am
but
at
least
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
shine
the
beer
has
got
an
unusual
name
and
label
but
it
has
a
flavor
that
any
beer
geek
ought
to
try
unique
thats
what
best
describes
good
humans
very
smooth
for
8
with
lots
of
flavor
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
has
a
slight
bitterness
upfront
with
a
light
touch
of
the
straw
and
grassy
hop
notes
but
its
balanced
by
a
gentle
malty
sweetness
along
with
a
hint
of
maple
its
an
interesting
beer
that
stakes
out
a
different
style
and
makes
it
work
in
the
process
a
great
winter
seasonal
sipper
regardless
of
when
its
available
strange
brew
as
are
many
coming
off
of
shorts
line
but
this
one
hits
the
mark
pretty
well
is
it
an
ipa
is
it
a
brown
ale
why
cant
it
be
both
i
didnt
know
how
a
doublebrown
dry
hopped
beer
would
be
but
the
caramel
flavors
from
the
malt
mix
and
the
jungle
flavors
from
the
hops
play
nicely
together
this
is
a
big
but
very
drinkable
beer
i
loved
it
but
there
were
a
few
issues
that
kept
it
from
greatness
o
pretty
tasty
brown
ale
more
hazelnut
nuttiness
than
most
others
but
still
has
nice
flavors
and
bitterness
i
really
do
like
the
nose
on
this
one
really
nice
hop
influence
going
on
overall
the
hops
really
do
stick
with
the
beer
on
this
one
providing
a
constant
influence
that
clearly
speaks
of
dry
hops
a
different
take
on
brown
ales
that
works
out
pretty
nicely
m
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
decrease
appearance
and
mouthfeel
and
increased
taste
and
overall
this
beer
pours
a
lighter
bodied
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
slight
off
white
lacing
it
smells
of
slightly
smoked
malts
and
raisins
its
definitely
on
the
malty
side
the
flavors
are
dry
and
hoppy
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
im
glad
the
hops
are
present
here
since
they
were
absent
in
the
nose
the
flavor
builds
with
time
as
well
it
drinks
light
in
body
with
a
nice
after
taste
overall
this
is
a
solid
brown
im
glad
i
could
try
it
ooverall
im
pleased
with
this
offering
from
shorts
i
really
thought
they
did
a
good
job
with
this
brown
ale
really
goes
well
with
the
season
decent
beer
worth
a
try
overall
nothing
really
bad
to
say
about
this
except
maybe
could
use
more
roasty
or
nutty
flavors
kind
of
drinks
more
like
a
mildly
hoppy
amber
ale
if
you
ask
me
nugget
nectar
like
poured
out
a
nice
dark
carmel
color
pretty
typical
for
browns
loved
the
dry
hoppped
flavors
good
cure
for
boring
browns
the
smells
doesnt
give
you
a
whole
lot
but
it
does
have
a
good
carmel
smell
with
just
a
bit
of
flower
in
there
from
the
hops
very
sweet
smell
probably
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
ever
had
didnt
expect
it
given
the
smell
very
smooth
given
the
high
alcohol
content
o
higher
than
i
expected
tasty
and
quenching
a
very
solid
and
respectable
session
brown
with
hopitude
had
this
one
after
a
few
while
downtown
in
ann
arbor
pours
dark
cloudy
brown
with
not
much
head
smells
of
booze
roasted
grain
piney
hops
some
sweet
molasses
taste
is
pretty
harsh
and
i
am
not
sure
what
they
were
going
for
here
heavy
burnt
booze
flavor
some
bitter
but
not
balancing
molasses
roast
mouthfeel
is
a
lot
of
booze
a
little
syrup
with
low
carbonation
this
one
was
just
unpleasant
for
me
not
a
fan
sharp
tingly
hop
bite
resinous
and
piney
chocolate
and
toasted
nut
flavor
follows
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
very
enjoyable
reminds
me
of
ellies
brown
maybe
a
little
hoppier
definitely
hoppier
in
the
nose
alcohol
had
a
kick
on
the
palate
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
but
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
hoppy
brown
ales
o
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
dont
know
if
its
been
sitting
for
too
long
or
if
this
is
how
its
supposed
to
taste
i
have
had
a
lot
of
bad
luck
with
shorts
beers
in
the
past
so
im
not
surprised
that
this
is
yet
another
flunker
o
its
a
bit
sweeter
than
bellaire
brown
which
i
honestly
like
but
i
dont
know
how
it
holds
up
against
some
other
michigan
browns
not
bad
though
o
wonderful
american
brown
ale
rich
yet
extremely
drinkable
its
a
great
fallwinter
brew
higher
abv
is
deceptively
wellhidden
it
went
really
well
with
the
considerable
snow
we
received
over
the
weekend
i
certainly
wish
i
could
get
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
hopefully
they
will
up
their
distro
to
oh
someday
soon
overall
this
is
a
fairly
decent
brown
ale
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
i
still
tried
to
rate
accordingly
the
ugly
lifeless
appearance
and
thin
mouth
feel
knocked
it
down
more
than
anything
really
overall
it
infected
and
really
give
this
beer
a
fair
shot
i
drain
poured
this
beer
and
i
dont
do
that
very
often
overall
this
is
quite
an
interesting
beer
and
despite
the
fact
that
it
a
hoppy
darker
style
ale
i
enjoyed
it
the
hops
really
come
through
and
make
you
forget
that
youre
drinking
a
brown
ale
for
a
second
but
the
maltiness
is
there
to
help
the
balance
throughout
and
create
quite
a
pleasant
flavor
profile
not
something
i
need
to
revisit
anytime
soon
but
pleasant
enough
overall
really
well
made
beer
great
earth
and
sweet
combo
of
flavors
ive
had
other
kinds
of
brews
that
aim
to
combine
the
two
in
the
past
at
best
they
come
out
like
this
brew
at
worst
they
taste
like
dirt
overall
this
was
a
good
brown
ale
but
not
so
much
what
i
was
looking
for
its
surprisingly
normal
for
a
shorts
beer
and
while
its
well
crafted
it
seems
like
its
aimed
more
towards
making
everybody
happy
somewhat
fitting
for
a
beer
named
good
humans
o
the
dry
hopping
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
brown
ale
base
wouldnt
mind
seeing
more
hoppy
brown
ales
d
a
big
robust
very
tasty
and
very
easy
pleasant
drinking
beer
it
would
be
super
easy
to
over
do
it
with
this
one
it
has
a
ton
going
on
but
is
just
so
drinkable
and
well
crafted
that
the
glass
swiftly
empties
as
you
attempt
to
contemplate
fresh
bottle
from
champagnes
cellar
this
tastes
a
lot
more
hoppy
than
19
ibu
more
or
less
neutral
aroma

white

o
review
to
style
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
very
drinkable
even
with
the
elevated
abv
the
dry
hopping
goes
nicely
with
a
fairly
well
rounded
brown
ale
o
a
very
good
double
brown
ale
while
its
nothing
spectacular
its
certainly
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
with
plenty
of
drinkability
another
good
shorts
beer
where
i
could
sit
back
and
have
multiples
without
getting
sick
of
the
taste
o
a
fantastic
brew
from
shorts
here
wish
i
could
get
this
all
the
time
in
colorado
i
am
liking
brown
ales
more
and
more
i
really
do
think
its
an
underrated
style
and
can
be
done
in
many
different
varieties
i
like
the
fact
that
this
is
a
double
brown
ale
and
that
its
dryhopped
id
like
to
see
more
breweries
stretching
the
boundaries
of
the
classic
styles
thanks
flandersned
for
the
opportunity
o
this
looked
like
it
would
be
a
total
try
it
once
and
never
think
about
it
again
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
d
easy
drinking
bigger
hop
presence
was
a
nice
addition
to
a
rather
standard
brown
try
it
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
brought
something
different
to
the
style
that
in
my
opinion
improved
upon
it
nice
work
shorts
o
very
interesting
it
is
a
nice
hoppy
sour
ale
very
well
done
beer
but
reading
other
reviews
it
appears
that
shorts
quality
control
continues
to
be
an
issue
with
this
beer
as
well
very
unique
brewery
but
very
disappointing
and
unprofessional
considering
that
scale
and
scope
of
their
infection
issues
o
d
i
couldnt
get
through
my
glass
and
had
to
pour
it
it
just
wasnt
enjoyable
im
almost
positive
this
was
a
bad
bottle
fortunately
there
seems
to
be
more
positive
reviews
here
than
neutralnegative
o
oddly
ive
been
more
impressed
with
the
regular
beers
from
shorts
than
their
oddball
dessert
beers
this
is
a
prime
example
get
this
fresh
and
enjoy
only
shorts
hitandmiss
qc
make
me
reluctant
to
give
this
a
stronger
recommendation
o
if
id
be
guaranteed
a
good
bottle
each
time
id
pick
it
up
again
i
know
that
theyve
had
a
run
of
issues
with
beers
going
sour
or
infected
at
times
not
sure
either
way
worth
a
pick
up
though
taste
is
not
what
i
expected
from
the
smell
first
it
is
sweet
and
malty
but
that
is
followed
by
a
lot
of
fruit
cherries
and
plums
and
it
finishes
a
little
tart
only
a
touch
of
bitterness
no
real
hop
character
although
it
is
a
winter
seasonal
and
im
drinking
it
on
april
2
so
the
dryhopped
character
may
have
faded
a
bit
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
to
a
brownish
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
roasted
malt
with
small
notes
of
fruit
and
nuts
in
the
taste
a
sweet
roast
and
complimented
with
a
nice
sweet
fruitiness
and
balanced
back
down
with
a
dry
nuttiness
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
fruit
and
nut
aftertaste
nice
malt
and
the
fruitiness
is
really
nice
this
is
a
mediumbodied
ale
with
adequate
carbonation
to
add
life
without
being
spritzy
theres
a
bit
of
warmth
and
the
hops
add
a
dryness
to
the
body
to
result
in
a
body
thats
overall
semidry
each
sip
goes
pleasantly
creamy
and
a
nice
complexity
lingers
in
the
finish
o
almost
a
souped
up
gueze
ive
read
lots
on
here
and
other
places
about
how
shorts
beer
have
tons
of
quality
issues
constant
bottle
infections
blah
blah
blah
etc
etc
etc
im
not
sure
to
believe
these
charges
or
to
just
believe
that
the
brewers
at
shorts
are
just
weirdos
either
way
this
wasnt
entirely
a
disaster
and
was
by
far
the
most
unusual
brown
ale
ive
ever
tasted
o
this
had
the
possibilities
of
an
incidental
oud
bruin
but
fell
short
either
way
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
based
on
the
high
probability
of
infection
o
honestly
this
beer
isnt
awful
i
just
find
it
lightly
offensive
between
the
overthetop
hop
profile
thats
not
balanced
very
well
also
im
not
sure
if
the
date
is
a
production
or
best
before
although
the
hops
havent
faded
it
seems
but
there
seems
to
be
some
sort
of
bug
in
it
lastly
the
label
calls
it
a
double
but
theres
no
alcohol
anywhere
then
again
shorts
excels
at
covering
up
alcohol
levels
d
high
very
smooth
goes
down
quick
overall
not
my
style
at
all
but
this
is
a
great
take
on
a
brown
im
enjoying
this
beer
and
happy
i
have
another
in
the
fridge
regret
not
having
it
uberfresh
so
i
could
enjoy
the
dry
hops
but
still
very
pleasant
cheers
probably
the
weak
spot
in
the
shorts
lineup
for
me
its
good
but
ive
come
to
expect
more
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
was
below
average
for
me
the
hoppiness
was
nice
but
that
sugary
sweet
tart
fruity
flavor
hurt
the
beer
overall
for
me
it
just
didnt
seem
to
fit
the
beer
style
at
all
as
i
said
it
seems
like
a
flavor
i
get
out
of
a
lot
of
shorts
beers
not
a
terrible
beer
overall
but
not
a
great
one
either
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
unique
and
good
brown
ale
i
like
this
one
a
little
more
then
bellaire
brown
it
had
all
the
great
brown
ale
flavors
i
love
but
with
a
citrus
hop
twist
that
you
dont
get
with
many
brown
ales
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
feel
could
replace
bellaire
brown
as
a
year
round
serving
good
unique
brew
shorts
just
when
i
think
i
know
just
about
everything
about
a
style
you
guys
put
out
something
crazy
like
this
and
make
me
eat
my
words
touche
thanks
to
hurfer
for
the
extra
poured
from
12oz
bottle
no
date
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
a
reddish
brown
deeper
copper
with
decent
haze
a
decent
sized
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
that
laces
a
bit
aromas
are
brown
malts
and
nut
toffee
and
tobbacco
some
vanilla
faint
cocoa
soapy
grapefruit
hops
and
floral
come
in
with
a
bit
of
rind
and
grass
toasty
bread
and
caramel
mixes
with
a
good
hopping
initial
is
well
hopped
up
front
bitter
and
floral
with
a
touch
of
soap
moves
into
caramel
and
toffee
biscuits
and
toasty
bread
tobbacco
brown
malts
earthy
hops
mix
with
grapefruit
and
tougher
florals
on
the
backend
providing
a
nice
contrast
from
sticky
sweet
malts
and
stronger
hops
with
good
acidics
medium
bodied
a
firm
bitterness
counters
the
sweeter
malts
of
cocoa
and
caramel
finish
is
nutty
floral
and
pine
with
mellow
sweetness
having
final
say
on
the
tounge
and
bitterness
going
down
the
throat
tasty
a
nice
beer
overall
and
im
probably
not
quite
giving
it
enough
credit
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
a
strong
brown
ale
for
the
style
and
an
interesting
beer
from
a
small
local
brewery
drinkablity
like
most
of
these
shorts
beers
12oz
is
plenty
this
beer
was
just
okay
for
me
i
was
really
excited
because
it
was
a
style
i
had
never
seen
before
and
i
love
me
some
hops
it
tasted
like
a
beer
a
friend
made
using
cheap
equipment
you
know
the
kind
you
can
taste
the
potential
but
the
way
it
was
brewed
leaves
it
lacking
not
bad
by
any
means
just
not
something
id
look
for
really
hard
swifty
donated
this
to
me
its
tasty
and
a
style
ive
never
had
strong
hop
significance
to
a
brown
ale
its
pretty
tasty
i
mixed
a
porter
and
an
ipa
before
and
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
that
beer
its
darker
in
color
reminiscent
of
a
traditional
brown
ale
the
smell
is
a
little
hoppy
but
does
have
a
strong
malt
presence
the
taste
is
good
with
caramel
oak
and
finishing
with
a
nice
bitterness
balancing
it
out
definitely
a
nice
idea
its
pretty
tasty
with
a
nice
aftertaste
its
exactly
what
you
would
think
with
a
dry
hopped
brown
ale
and
tastes
like
a
mix
of
an
ipa
and
a
brown
ale
and
if
you
like
either
of
those
styles
of
beers
you
will
like
this
one
too
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
odd
sour
flavors
not
at
all
what
i
expect
in
a
brown
ale
drinkability
has
a
very
unique
flavor
profile
but
inconsistencies
that
bring
out
the
flaws
in
the
beer
or
maybe
intentional
qualities
drinkability
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
im
not
sure
if
i
got
an
old
bottle
or
what
but
the
fruity
flavor
really
turned
me
off
i
find
these
humans
to
be
very
drinkable
they
are
a
great
combination
of
a
nutty
malty
brown
ale
and
a
hoppy
citrusy
pale
ale
this
is
a
tasty
treat
that
i
will
enjoy
much
over
the
years
d
its
a
good
beer
but
id
only
have
one
on
account
of
the
aforementioned
stickiness
i
experienced
upon
finishing
to
my
mind
an
excellent
brew
its
a
wonderful
marriage
of
ipa
and
brown
ale
elements
which
i
enjoy
immensely
this
pairing
really
seems
like
a
great
beer
for
hopheads
and
lovers
of
brown
ales
alike
as
it
offers
a
nice
palate
of
both
worlds
i
recently
gave
one
of
these
to
a
good
friend
who
usually
tends
towards
macro
pilsners
and
he
loved
it
i
look
forward
buying
another
6pack
before
its
next
brewing
d
not
quite
sure
how
much
id
seek
this
one
out
again
im
guessing
this
is
infected
as
the
flavor
is
immediately
artificially
sweet
like
orange
and
strawberry
starburst
and
finishes
with
an
astringent
sourness
under
that
mess
there
is
some
nutty
malt
flavors
but
still
no
hops
the
more
i
drink
the
less
sure
im
that
this
is
infected
but
regardless
im
not
enjoying
this
and
will
pour
out
the
rest
of
the
glass
oh
well
md
almost
like
drinking
sour
candy
i
received
a
bm
from
gnemesis
who
traded
this
my
way
saying
it
might
be
infected
after
reading
some
other
recent
reviews
seems
like
maybe
a
bad
batch
hit
shelves
they
dont
seem
to
jive
with
all
the
other
reviews
if
i
get
another
chance
to
taste
this
have
another
bottle
but
it
is
likely
the
same
batch
i
will
adjust
my
review
accordingly
drinkability
i
was
expecting
a
dryhopped
brown
ale
and
i
got
mild
dark
fruit
and
much
hop
presence
maybe
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
based
on
the
other
reviews
but
there
was
almost
no
hop
presence
the
mouth
is
light
and
carbonated
well
this
helps
in
drinkability
quite
the
flavors
are
different
from
standard
browns
ive
had
the
citrus
aspect
carries
over
here
as
well
with
flavors
of
lemon
orange
and
mild
bitterness
from
the
hops
the
usual
brown
characteristics
are
fleeting
if
not
absent
some
mild
malty
sweetness
on
the
back
end
this
was
a
different
take
i
guess
the
more
i
have
from
these
guys
the
more
i
learn
that
they
like
to
push
the
envelope
a
bit
on
the
styles
and
ingredients
id
have
it
again
i
guess
but
not
when
im
looking
for
a
brown
ale
d
despite
all
the
weird
stuff
about
this
beer
from
the
outofplace
hops
to
the
empty
mouthfeel
to
the
funky
sweetness
i
think
it
is
pretty
drinkable
its
odd
but
its
not
offensive
mouthfeel
was
a
little
bigger
than
i
prefer
especially
for
a
brown
but
because
of
the
nice
balance
you
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
or
two
dvery
drinkable
frankly
dear
i
dont
give
a
schlitz

good
humans

with

a

with
some

smells
sweet
and
resinous
roasted

some

some

hazelnut
finish
no

medium

and
medium

good
drinkability
for
for
a
double
brown
would
be
interesting
to
find
out
what
the
abv
is
a
really
odd
brown
ale
and
yet
another
shorts
brew
with
a
tartsourness
makes
me
wonder
if
this
is
really
what
they
are
intending
i
know
they
had
some
infections
issues
but
across
different
brews
still
the
experimentations
maybe
starting
to
hinder
at
this
point
d
goes
down
very
smooth
nice
drinkability
drinks
pretty
good
id
certainly
have
it
again
d
this
beer
is
drinkable
not
a
problem
the
abv
i
would
suggest
is
higher
making
it
kind
of
a
deadly
combo
with
the
drinkability
i
dont
think
shorts
really
makes
a
beer
that
is
great
in
the
carbonation
department
which
i
expect
from
them
this
alone
makes
it
drop
half
a
point
in
this
category
d
okay
but
i
wouldnt
order
again
or
buy
six
tasty
but
only
one
for
me
altogether
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
great
by
any
means
pours
into
a
brownish
red
colored
body
with
a
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
and
some
of
the
best
lacing
i
have
seen
on
a
beer
the
carbonation
is
also
good
on
this
one
the
smell
is
a
nice
fruity
smell
along
with
some
hops
pine
toffee
some
citrus
too
love
the
smell
of
this
beer
the
taste
is
of
pine
coffee
chocolate
folloed
by
some
hops
and
citrus
it
is
not
too
strong
in
any
tastes
and
is
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
smooth
medium
body
feel
and
this
is
so
good
and
smooth
that
how
could
it
not
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinks
very
well
variety
of
flavors
are
crafted
together
well
another
good
one
from
shorts
d
high
i
would
drink
this
a
lot
if
i
had
it
in
my
local
stores
one
of
the
better
am
brown
ales
out
there
im
loving
the
hop
bite
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
tasty
i
could
drink
multiple
of
these
in
one
sitting
though
the
richness
might
fill
me
up
after
a
bit
the
verdict
good
humans
good
overall
shorts
brewing
always
offers
delectible
liquid
libations
for
all
to
me
this
brew
hangs
in
the
middle
its
not
bad
at
all
but
just
lacks
some
punch
its
very
easy
drinking
being
a
michigan
resident
i
feel
obligated
to
try
the
shorts
offerings
i
honestly
have
not
been
all
that
impressed
except
for
their
ipa
overall
this
beer
smells
like
a
pale
ale
looks
like
a
brown
and
has
bitter
and
roasted
flavors
very
smooth
and
creamy
perfect
amount
of
hops
that
are
countered
nicely
easily
drinkable
i
hope
the
abv
isnt
too
high
poured
a
nice
medium
brown
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
left
good
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
it
smells
surprisingly
hoppy
also
there
are
notes
of
lemon
zest
a
little
roastiness
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
great
there
is
a
nice
earthy
hop
bite
right
up
front
there
is
also
some
roastiness
that
is
cut
by
some
malty
sweetness
there
is
also
some
alcohol
notes
that
come
in
at
the
finish
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
good
on
this
it
has
a
good
medium
body
with
nice
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
on
this
i
could
drink
these
quite
often
this
beer
was
a
definite
surprise
i
have
never
had
a
brown
ale
like
this
before
and
i
hope
to
find
more
brown
ales
like
this
if
anyone
knows
any
please
recommend
some
to
me
anyways
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
good
job
shorts

pours
a
nice

nice
white

a

is
really
nice
with
some
sweet

roasted
brown
malts
along
with
some
nice
piney

really
love
the
concept
as
this
seems
to
be
done
differently
than
the
typical
hoppy
brown
the
taste
scales
back
a
bit
with
some
slight
bitterness
roast

bitterness
drinks
quite
well
and
im
glad
that
put
this
into
bottles
overall
would
take
this
any
day
over
an
arrogant
bastard
or
other
strong
ale
just
really
really
well
done
had
it
again
about
a
year
later
and
have
to
say
that
its
a
brown
ale
jam
packed
with
all
the
possible
qualities
great
thing
is
that
it
evolves
into
something
with
each
sip
with
food
a
unique
earthy
fruit
blend
pine
resin
chocolate
bittle
blood
orange
with
a
dry
ender
this
is
the
prefect
time
to
have
it
somewhat
of
a
hop
unique
beer
somewhat
of
a
malt
unique
beer
too
and
i
like
that
may
be
a
tad
sweet
for
some
but
its
suit
well
for
the
finish
bottle
pours
a
fairly
carbonated
light
brown
color
with
a
slighlty
tan
head
notty
fruity
hoppy
notes
abound
in
the
nose
nice
medium
mouthfeel
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
not
super
awesome
but
a
nice
twist
on
a
brown
ale
with
the
addition
of
the
added
hops
good
lace
as
i
poured
this
brew
into
my
nonick
pint
glass
out
came
a
cloudy
brown
ale
with
a
slight
bit
of
an
orange
glow
in
the
light
there
was
a
nice
white
full
head
on
top
with
great
retention
as
i
tipped
the
glass
upon
dipping
my
nose
into
the
glass
there
was
an
overwhelming
hop
aroma
beautifully
hoppy
theres
a
tinge
of
malt
backing
but
the
majority
of
the
scent
is
a
nice
cirtusy
floral
hop
goodness
the
brew
has
an
uncommon
yet
delightful
flavor
to
it
you
can
taste
the
brown
ale
you
can
taste
the
hops
but
theres
a
quality
citrus
balance
in
between
it
all
it
tastes
more
like
a
wellbalanced
ipa
than
it
does
a
brown
ale
however
the
amount
of
malt
and
slight
bit
of
roastiness
i
taste
within
makes
it
switch
back
and
forth
on
my
palate
the
citrusfruit
undertone
mellows
out
all
the
flavors
and
brings
it
back
to
earth
i
really
enjoying
this
brews
flavor
after
each
sip
was
a
fruity
sensation
that
almost
had
the
essence
of
a
lime
zest
little
heat
afterthefact
as
well
i
mean
it
is
a
double
afterall
overall
a
really
nice
new
take
on
a
brown
ale
worth
a
shot
for
sure
poured
a
nice
clear
mahogany
brown
with
a
short
lived
beige
head
theres
an
awesome
chocolate
aroma
here
nearly
like
a
hersheys
milk
chocolate
thing
going
on
subtle
raisins
and
caramel
in
the
background
but
surely
a
chocolatefronted
beer
flavor
bursts
of
chocolate
raisins
and
a
hint
of
toffee
in
the
finish
very
mild
bitterness
if
at
all
noticeable
smooth
and
mildly
carbonated
a
lovely
drinker
for
sure
overall
a
rather
average
beer
maybe
a
touch
different
for
the
style
but
not
out
of
bounds
or
anything
drinkable
the
beer
pours
a
clear
brownishred
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
chocolate
mint
caramel
malt
and
some
piney
hops
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
chocolate
with
some
pine
you
also
get
caramel
not
too
terribly
complex
but
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
brown
ale
with
some
nice
hopping
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
dthis
is
very
tasty
it
is
a
little
hot
in
the
back
but
has
a
nice
balance
of
both
malts
and
hops
it
is
actually
more
hohp
forward
but
it
is
quite
tasty
unique
and
different
but
it
works
carbonation
is
lowmoderate
fairly
smooth
on
the
palate
with
a
touch
of
residual
sweetness
and
some
heaviness
in
the
end
interesting
concept
of
a
dry
hopped
double
brown
but
there
are
a
few
conflicting
flavors
at
the
beginning
after
half
of
the
bottle
the
finish
gets
a
little
rough
and
more
alcoholic
wasnt
that
impressed
by
this
one
d
good
drinkability
goes
down
easy
and
the
flavor
is
nice
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
the
variation
shorts
has
put
on
this
style
definitely
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
lasting
foamy
off
white
head
leavins
some
lagged
lacing
medium
carbonation
aroma
is
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
caramel
walnuts
and
brown
sugar
flavor
is
nutty
with
spicy
citrus
and
piny
hops
a
little
smoky
toffee
and
brown
sugar
nice
bitterness
level
very
hop
forward
for
a
brown
full
body
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
nutty
earthy
finish
seems
to
get
quite
sweet
if
you
let
it
get
to
room
temp
very
drinkable
another
quality
and
intresting
product
from
shorts
d
very
drinkable
a
good
balance
between
zest
bitter
and
sweetness
would
definitely
buy
again
and
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
of
the
shorts
limited
releases
if
theres
one
thing
you
can
say
about
shorts
brewing
its
that
theyre
trailblazers
good
humans
is
further
proof
of
that
i
dont
think
ive
encountered
a
brown
ale
quite
like
this
one
it
has
a
deep
flavor
profile
that
seems
to
feature
a
little
bit
of
everything
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
has
a
good
flavor
but
doesnt
quite
strike
me
as
great
nonetheless
its
very
interesting
and
worth
your
attention
thanks
derek
i
really
enjoyed
the
bottle
drinkability
i
like
this
but
not
enough
to
sit
back
and
drink
a
six
pack
of
it
very
interesting
beer
and
i
would
like
to
have
it
at
least
one
more
time
and
share
it
with
my
brother
in
law
i
feel
he
would
appreciate
it
smells
like
some
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
of
citric
bite
up
front
toasted
nuts
as
it
warmed
with
a
little
grainy
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
is
very
unusual
whats
the
abv
what
is
going
on
here
weird
fullness
to
the
mouthfeel
without
being
too
heavy
and
not
your
typical
brown
ale
by
any
means
firm
bitterness
and
some
grassy
hop
flavor
with
a
moderate
fruitiness
but
its
all
in
a
very
odd
balance
with
the
caramel
malt
and
grainyness
it
somehow
works
though
pleasant
enough
and
pretty
drinkable
i
would
guess
its
7
5
or
so
overall
a
solid
beer
what
doesnt
shorts
do
right
overall
this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
beer
from
shorts
and
i
commend
them
for
doing
a
great
job
fusing
an
ipa
with
an
american
brown
though
the
split
is
probably
about
7525
with
the
ipa
ahead
it
definitely
works
very
well
d
good
pretty
solid
unique
take
on
the
style
43
54
544
the
palate
opens
with
plenty
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
but
this
definitely
isnt
syrupy
these
flavors
are
well
complemented
but
the
aroma
hops
with
some
sweet
citrus
present
hop
bitterness
appears
towards
the
finish
with
a
mildly
grassy
offflavor
almost
vegetal
the
sweetness
of
the
finish
almost
tastes
artificial
like
theres
some
spledaequal
present
as
it
warms
up
theres
a
fruity
yeast
character
present
which
doesnt
really
work
well
here
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
mediumhigh
level
of
carbonation
this
is
solid
stuff
i
did
like
drinking
this
drinkability
is
great
i
really
liked
the
belaire
but
love
the
extra
depth
and
character
that
the
hops
lend
this
one
over
the
belaire
that
one
was
delicious
but
this
one
just
has
a
little
more
pop
to
it
great
balance
super
tasty
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
pretty
thick
low
carbonation
some
warmth
but
goes
down
smooth
a
pretty
nice
beer
thanks
russ
d
im
sure
the
abv
isnt
below
6
this
is
pretty
drinkable
though
it
is
pretty
sweet
i
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
1
at
a
time
d
its
difficult
to
criticize
shorts
this
is
no
exception
i
like
the
syrupy
hoppiness
and
how
it
gradually
builds
up
its
strength
very
hop
forward
especially
for
the
style
with
lot
of
dry
bitter
pine
notes
as
well
as
a
very
prominent
sweet
citrus
presence
hints
of
orange
and
lemon
peel
along
with
some
grapefruit
and
mango
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
creamy
texture
mid
palate
the
hops
are
prominent
and
linger
throughout
but
are
nicely
balanced
by
a
slightly
toasty
caramel
malt
backbone
hints
of
toffee
and
hazelnut
as
well
as
some
biscuit
these
notes
are
noticeable
underneath
but
this
beer
is
truly
dominated
by
the
dry
bitter
and
sweet
citrus
hop
notes
this
beer
is
truly
unique
and
a
welcome
twist
to
the
style
very
complex
and
flavorful
with
a
very
dry
finish
notes
i
wrote
shorts
brewing
inquiring
about
the
abv
and
have
yet
to
receive
a
response
d
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
and
the
description
was
enough
to
intrigue
me
the
hops
really
come
through
and
make
you
forget
that
youre
drinking
a
brown
ale
for
a
second
overall
a
great
beer
that
was
truly
original
d
really
like
it
good
drinker
overall
decent
i
guess
but
nothing
too
amazing
drinkability
above
average
this
is
an
outstanding
brown
ale
especially
if
you
like
a
hefty
hop
presence
to
mix
things
up
a
bit
highly
recommended
this
strikes
me
as
an
interesting
experiment
but
not
one
ill
return
to
good
on
shorts
for
trying
new
things
d
really
interesting
brew
here
sweet
and
toasty
good
humans
offers
a
unique
twist
on
a
brown
ale
by
incorporating
quite
a
bit
of
citrusy
hop
character
yum
got
this
one
thanks
to
telix
pours
a
nice
light
golden
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
fizzles
to
lacing
the
smell
is
decent
some
lightly
roasted
malts
a
faint
whiff
of
hops
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
lightly
roasted
malts
providing
subtle
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
hops
providing
a
little
bite
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
medium
body
and
good
drinkability
overall
this
a
solid
beer
with
some
nice
complexity
and
excellent
flavors
i
could
see
enjoying
quite
a
few
of
these
i
havent
had
anything
like
this
before
and
id
go
for
another
i
like
it
this
seems
perfect
for
fallwinter
weather
d
yet
another
unique
yet
tasty
brew
from
shorts
certainly
a
different
take
on
a
brown
ale
with
the
addition
of
dry
hopping
not
the
best
out
there
but
i
respect
shorts
for
thinking
outside
the
box
trippy
label
the
beer
poured
a
bright
clear
chestnut
with
a
thin
beigetan
cap
of
fine
bubbles
a
bit
of
sticky
lace
decent
head
retention
big
citrus
aroma
lots
of
grapefruit
with
some
caramel
and
earthy
malt
in
the
background
sort
of
surprising
but
nice
bold
hop
flavour
juicy
citrus
grapefruit
moderate
to
high
bitterness
with
enough
malt
sweetness
caramel
faint
nuts
and
chocolate
to
provide
some
balance
it
finished
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
lingering
combination
of
malts
and
bitterness
the
body
was
lighter
than
expected
not
thin
exactly
but
headed
in
that
direction
carbonation
was
mediumlow
and
the
texture
was
malty
with
a
bit
of
dryness
once
the
sweetness
dissipated
an
interesting
beer
plenty
of
flavour
and
quite
tasty
pours
a
pretty
clear
rustic
amber
brown
with
a
two
finger
light
khaki
colored
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
bits
of
lacing
here
and
there
but
not
much
aroma
is
one
of
a
kind
roasted
coffee
citrus
hops
and
bready
malts
i
like
the
smell
but
it
could
be
bolder
taste
begins
with
toffee
and
caramel
sweetness
midway
a
good
combination
of
earthy
and
tropical
hop
flavors
emerge
chocolatey
brown
ale
characteristics
linger
in
the
aftertaste
with
just
a
splash
of
cara
cara
oranges
the
taste
is
a
wonderful
and
totally
unexpected
blend
of
brown
ale
and
hoppy
pale
ale
medium
body
with
a
steady
carbonation
and
a
slight
tingle
that
remains
on
the
tongue
another
solid
and
unique
brew
from
shorts
i
could
definitely
put
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
down
the
bottom
line
is
that
i
like
different
characteristics
when
they
mesh
together
stouts
are
maltheavy
and
lightly
hopped
ipas
are
hopheavy
and
have
small
malt
character
shorts
attempted
to
bring
the
two
most
notable
parts
of
beer
together
by
producing
a
maltheavy
ipa
and
pretty
much
succeeded
i
could
tip
a
few
of
these
back
because
its
delightful
but
whats
its
abv
its
goal
i
usually
look
this
stuff
up
on
the
internet
before
reviewing
so
i
know
exactly
what
the
intent
of
a
beer
is
shorts
if
you
brew
it
again
lets
call
it
a
dryhopped
dark
amber
ale
that
would
have
been
perfect
this
is
now
one
of
my
favorite
brown
ales
and
i
prefer
it
to
surly
bender
great
job
shorts
starts
off
with
toasted
grains
soapy
sweetness
and
subtle
hop
bitterness
cola
and
caramel
sweetness
increase
along
with
herbal
resinous
hoppiness
slightly
earthy
tobacco
and
chocolate
flavors
near
the
finish
fruity
alcohol
contributes
some
warming
grainy
herbal
bitterness
in
the
finish
mediumfull
body
with
a
somewhat
sticky
feel
not
bad
but
a
tad
rough
around
the
edges
and
not
as
cohesive
as
it
could
be
cheers
d
if
you
are
into
this
style
i
can
imagine
wanting
to
have
a
few
its
clearly
the
best
of
the
shorts
limited
releases
that
ive
had
which
isnt
saying
much
but
its
pretty
good
i
wish
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smelled
d
this
has
got
to
be
at
least
eight
or
nine
percent
abv
but
it
goes
down
smooth
anyway
clean
and
delicious
overall
an
awesome
beer
that
will
only
get
better
with
time
in
the
cellar
d
the
flavors
in
this
one
are
not
too
heavy
and
lend
themselves
well
to
drinking
the
combination
of
the
dry
hopped
aroma
and
the
sweetness
of
the
brown
ale
make
a
great
combination
the
sample
came
from
the
first
bottle
run
put
out
by
shorts
their
appearance
on
shelves
cam
with
little
warning
and
even
less
information
the
majority
of
what
is
known
comes
from
the
bottle
itself
the
drinkability
may
be
able
to
be
scored
more
accurately
if
the
abv
was
available
with
that
being
said
i
am
impressed
by
this
brew
very
enjoyable
and
provides
a
pleasant
warming
feeling
as
it
goes
down
which
is
welcome
this
time
of
year
drinks
smooth
and
easy
making
it
one
i
would
consider
drinking
a
couple
in
a
sitting
once
again
hats
off
to
joe
and
the
gang
for
producing
such
a
fine
product
very
good
american
brown
and
its
not
too
far
behind
surly
bender
in
my
book
one
of
the
best
of
the
new
shorts
bottle
releases
overall
an
ale
that
fell
flat
for
me
since
there
arent
many
representatives
of
this
style
i
cant
really
compare
it
to
a
certain
forerunner
ill
definitely
try
more
dbl
brown
ales
as
i
come
across
them
but
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
in
the
future
glad
i
tried
it
though
d
a
very
unique
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
a
bit
sweet
and
warm
for
my
tastes
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
as
well
i
wish
this
would
be
a
regular
offering
this
is
much
stronger
and
more
bitter
than
the
typical
brown
ale
still
this
is
pretty
refreshing
and
interesting
o
one
of
the
more
flavorful
brown
ales
that
ive
had
in
a
while
sweet
malty
nutty
as
a
brown
ale
should
be
had
on
draft
well
balanced
great
taste
it
is
a
very
average
brown
ale
it
tastes
like
beer
but
is
nothing
special
overall
excellent
brew
first
time
drinking
this
and
it
wont
be
the
last
overall
a
mediocre
brown
ale
could
use
more
complexity
and
balance
as
far
as
the
malt
goes
soso
best
head
ive
had
on
an
american
brown
ale
perfect
hopping
in
popping
the
cap
i
released
a
bunch
of
gas
and
even
the
bottle
gave
off
a
hissing
noise
i
had
a
feeling
as
to
what
this
might
mean
but
i
began
a
heavyhanded
pour
anyway
it
was
not
long
before
the
glass
began
filling
with
foam
and
i
had
to
back
off
in
order
to
allow
it
to
settle
i
am
going
to
be
frank
here
and
say
that
due
to
its
overcarbonation
i
was
irritated
and
impatient
neither
of
which
are
conducive
to
a
positive
review
it
finally
settled
into
two
fingers
of
dense
soapy
lighttan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
brown
to

just

the

i
wonder
if
perhaps
this

was
past

i

enjoy
by

since
i
cant

duckrabbit
in
my
state
it
may
be
a

before
i
try
this
one
again

ill
definitely
give
it
a
go
with
a

thats
known
to
be

was

a

didnt

i
look

to
another

overall
i
thought
it
was
a
disappointing
offering
from
dr
as
i
absolutely
love
the
amber
an
milk
stout
overall
an
exquisite
brown
ale
with
tons
of
flavor
tasting
so
good
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
tough
one
to
grade
d
this
is
enjoyable
but
a
bit
hamstrung
by
how
bitter
it
is
the
bitterness
isnt
bad
but
it
overshadows
the
maltiness
of
a
beer
style
thats
supposed
to
feature
it
fairly
prominently
a
solid
if
unbalanced
brown
ale
md
lively
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
with
a
good
balance
of
flavors
the
nose
doesnt
do
this
beer
justice
i
really
dig
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
and
would
be
happy
to
have
a
few
in
an
evening
but
could
see
the
flavor
getting
old
if
you
were
to
drink
a
few
d
decent
drinkability
as
it
goes
down
easily
and
theres
nothing
hampering
that
but
there
isnt
enough
going
onwhats
going
on
isnt
enjoyable
enough
to
keep
me
wanting
more
55th
i
probably
need
to
revisit
this
beer
sometime
if
i
can
land
it
again
its
rather
intriguing
i
just
cant
give
a
wholly
formal
review
cheers
i
had
this
a
village
whisky
home
of
the
best
burger
in
the
world
but
i
digress
duck
rabbit
was
proudly
poured
in
my
pint
with
a
nice
brown
and
off
white
head
that
had
nice
lacing
it
has
a
decent
nose
full
of
chocolate
caramel
nuts
etc
some
sweetness
up
front
but
finished
ok
not
great
the
hops
were
there
but
not
much
of
presence
as
i
expected
i
really
want
to
love
duckrabbit
cuz
when
they
are
on
they
are
great
but
the
quality
control
issues
really
need
to
be
dealt
with
but
this
has
been
going
on
for
a
few
years
so
well
just
see
d
this
was
just
an
average
brown
ale
all
the
characteristics
were
there
the
nut
flavor
was
just
a
little
too
pronounced
for
me
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pour
brings
a
brown
colored
beer
with
a
bit
of
amber
in
there
off
white
head
that
starts
out
with
two
fingers
slowly
recedes
not
too
much
lacing
the
nose
is
some
caramel
toffee
bread
and
nuts
the
taste
is
mostly
some
slight
bread
with
a
bit
of
caramel
dressing
good
feel
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
drinks
fairly
well
but
is
a
bit
ordinary
d
this
has
a
nice
flavor
but
the
hypercarbonation
keeps
it
from
being
very
good
d
goes
down
alright
the
bitter
chocolate
and
citrus
could
be
blended
a
bit
better
not
too
filling
decent
kick
ok
representation
of
style
id
opt
for
other
brown
ales
but
wouldnt
turn
this
one
away
overall
this
is
a
nice
american
brown
ale
i
would
recommend
trying
this
one
out
if
you
havent
yet
another
solid
offering
from
duckrabbit
d
this
wasnt
the
first
brown
ale
ive
had
but
its
the
first
that
made
me
want
to
try
more
brown
ales
wish
i
could
get
this
back
home
d
a
very
drinkable
brown
that
has
a
different
to
me
and
my
american
palate
leafy
green
hop
note
which
i
find
adorable
d
this
did
not
taste
as
smoothi
as
other
brown
ales
the
more
i
drink
duck
rabbit
the
more
i
want
to
make
the
trip
out
to
farmville
the
taste
is
bigger
than
expected
from
the
smell
with
a
complex
malty
base
that
stands
out
pretty
well
bread
crust
and
a
very
slight
candy
chocolate
caramel
toffee
flavor
are
swirling
around
as
well
there
is
a
bitter
hop
edge
underneath
all
this
the
mouth
feel
is
thick
enough
to
give
this
beer
a
full
body
as
well
overall
a
good
beer
and
certainly
better
than
expected
for
some
reason
lots
of
carbonation
with
this
one
out
of
the
bottle
however
i
managed
to
contain
everything
in
the
glass
once
things
settled
down
a
bit
this
dark
amberbrown
brew
has
a
nice
light
hoppy
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
this
one
has
a
fruitybittering
hop
presence
on
the
first
sip
the
finish
is
wonderfully
roasty
almost
a
bit
of
chocolate
too
that
lingers
for
a
long
time
next
sip
is
then
sweet
on
the
top
side
bitter
in
the
middle
and
roasty
again
this
is
one
rather
complex
but
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brown
ale
thanks
to
glid02
for
this
one
its
a
good
beer
but
it
needs
to
have
the
carbonation
issue
worked
out
a
bit
and
it
would
be
much
better
i
might
have
to
rerate
this
at
a
later
time
d
based
on
the
taste
i
am
not
sure
id
seek
this
out
again
some
stellar
drinking
here
impressive
flavor
profiles
from
the
malt
and
hops
yet
still
very
sessionable
duckrabbit
raise
the
benchmark
a
few
notches
in
the
american
brown
ale
style
with
this
one
poured
a
dark
brown
body
with
massive
head
on
top
of
a
light
but
solid
malt
smell
dark
chocolate
roasted
bread
hints
of
coffee
toffee
also
some
bitter
hops
in
background
the
taste
is
similiar
to
aroma
as
a
smooth
medium
body
and
slight
creaminess
passes
over
the
tongue
leaving
both
a
residual
sweetness
from
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
and
there
is
a
dry
edge
that
is
bready
some
minor
sweet
and
citric
hops
in
backbite
lend
themselves
to
the
crisp
finish
good
balance
although
i
prefer
browns
w
a
lil
less
hoppiness
and
more
sweetness
cheers
clear
reddishbrown
in
color
with
a
full
frothy
head
smells
good
with
a
strong
roasted
grain
character
and
some
chocolate
and
toffee
taste
is
unique
and
delicious
toffee
and
roasted
malts
are
balanced
nicely
with
floral
and
grassy
hop
flavors
finish
is
a
little
dry
i
certainly
could
put
down
a
couple
of
these
a
nice
approach
to
the
style
and
a
good
allaround
ale
very
drinkable
poured
into
a

pint
glass
big
bulky
beige
head
1
12
inches
nice
amber
brown
with
beautiful
marble
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
thin
head
remains
throughout
no
matter
how
long
it
sitsvery
nice
it
has
the
inviting
smell
of
a
box
of
fine
belgium
chocolates
a
slightly
bitter
taste
with
a
mixture
of
sweet
gourmet
mocha
coffee
much
more
character
and
spunkiness
than
your
typical
brown
ale
and
a
bit
heavier
too
i
must
say
that
this
is
my
favorite
local
brewery
and
99
of
the
time
they
can
do
no
wrong
but
also
it
is
a
bit
high
priced
you
should
not
have
to
take
out
a
loan
to
buy
a
six
pack
i
only
live
right
down
the
road
that
should
at
least
eliminate
some
shipping
cost
am
i
right
the
beer
pours
a
rusty
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
backlit
the
toffee
head
is
absolutely
massive
and
rocky
retention
and
lacing
are
both
out
of
this
world
probably
the
best
looking
brown
ale
ive
ever
seen
despite
that
the
nose
is
a
little
weak
and
especially
the
promised
hoppiness
suffers
the
flavor
is
much
better
caramel
and
biscuity
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
roasted
chocolate
grapefruit
from
the
amarillo
is
a
wonderful
touch
on
the
back
end
and
a
brief
spicy
flourish
from
the
saaz
closes
things
out
nicely
i
had
worries
about
the
carbonation
given
the
mountainous
amount
of
head
that
foamed
up
from
my
pour
but
it
was
surprisingly
restrained
the
body
was
just
a
little
bit
thin
though
duck
rabbit
nailed
almost
everything
about
this
beer
i
can
only
hope
they
expand
their
distribution
more
to
the
northeast
d
the
palate
is
skewed
too
much
towards
the
hop
bitterness
for
the
style
which
becomes
an
overwhelming
factor
halfway
through
the
bottle
the
drinkability
suffers
accordingly
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
tried
looking
at
other
reviews
to
see
if
others
had
the
same
experience
with
this
beer
that
i
did
and
what
i
conclude
is
that
a
majority
of
tasters
also
tasted
the
same
acidity
that
i
taste
so
this
is
likely
not
a
contamination
or
defect
but
just
how
the
beer
is
also
because
the
beer
didnt
gush
or
smell
sour
i
dont
think
its
spoiled
just
not
good
drinkability
actually
very
surprising
and
tastey
that
puts
up
a
nice
little
fire
but
doesnt
put
out
the
warmth
did
satisfy
for
an
ale
nicely
drinkable
though
not
the
greatest
brown
out
there
distinctive
but
never
overthetop
i
can
imagine
it
perfectly
complementing
barbecue
ribs
with
hash
and
rice
d
that
taste
that
im
not
liking
its
really
getting
to
me
and
making
me
not
want
to
drink
anymore
but
i
will
because
im
a
trooper
id
be
willing
to
try
this
again
to
see
if
this
bottle
was
an
anomaly
but
that
almost
metallic
bitterness
ugh
i
have
yet
to
have
a
duck
rabbit
beer
that
i
didnt
like
and
this
one
is
no
exception
i
have
to
admit
that
i
expected
this
one
to
be
a
little
more
malty
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
drinkability
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
would
be
a
great
session
beer
in
the
shoulder
months
the
subtle
hop
presence
balances
the
crafty
use
of
malts
i
am
a
fan
d
this
is
a
nice
easydrinking
beer
even
for
warmer
days
it
is
not
overpowering
and
i
could
easily
have
another
good
drinkable
brown
ale
caseworthy
to
say
the
least
if
you
see
it
grab
it
good
sht
drinkability
a
very
nice
sessionable
brown
here
unoffensive
and
easy
going
this
is
a
unique
flavored
brown
ale
and
a
good
change
of
pace
i
find
this
to
be
complex
and
drinkable
and
hits
a
nice
balance
in
the
flavor
department
to
make
this
very
sessionable
i
am
very
surprised
by
its
bitterness
it
works
excellent
good
stuff
d
there
is
a
weird
blend
of
citrus
earthy
hops
and
roasted
malts
the
chocolate
and
lemon
are
odd
with
a
tartness
that
is
almost
lactic
but
a
bit
more
charred
malt
this
beer
is
a
bit
like
eating
dessert
after
brushing
your
teeth
the
flavors
really
fight
against
each
other
d
a
little
bitter
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
there
are
many
brown
ales
i
find
more
drinkable
overall
an
odd
beer
the
style
is
more
like
an
old
english
porter
i
guess
as
it
warmed
up
it
got
a
little
interesting
and
grew
on
me
but
along
with
the
other
stuff
ive
had
from
duck
rabbit
in
the
past
month
i
probably
wont
seek
anything
else
out
from
them
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
slightly
creamy
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
it
went
down
pretty
easy
it
had
some
good
flavors
and
very
good
head
retention
that
definitely
made
it
a
more
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
d
i
dont
know
i
find
this
too
unpalatable
to
really
say
its
drinkable
i
can
imagine
people
whose
primary
enjoyment
of
beer
being
the
hops
aromas
and
flavors
feeling
otherwise
still
this
is
a
measure
of
how
drinkable
i
find
it
and
i
just
cant
give
it
high
marks
overall
and
average
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
there
are
many
many
beers
including
most
other
duckrabbit
beers
i
would
chose
before
it
not
sure
id
want
3
or
4
in
a
row
but
on
a
cold
winter
day
nothing
better
i
would
try
this
beer
again
since
i
like
hoppy
brown
ales
and
think
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
potential
when
consumed
fresh
the
cask
and
hand
pump
left
an
incredibly
smooth
but
very
flat
and
thin
mouthfeel
all
things
considered
flat
taste
sour
bitterness
it
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
for
this
style
hv
i
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
redish
brown
it
had
about
2
fingers
of
head
that
went
away
very
fast
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
the
smell
of
carmel
malt
and
notes
of
butterscotch
there
is
a
small
to
medium
amount
of
lacing
the
taste
is
bitter
compared
to
the
smell
it
has
a
malty
hoppy
roasted
flavor
with
lots
of
carbonation
that
tickles
and
foams
in
the
mouth
the
after
taste
is
very
hoppy
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
but
the
hoppiness
of
it
is
a
surprise
because
the
smell
is
so
sweet
dnot
a
beer
id
rush
out
to
get
but
i
might
try
it
if
the
opportunity
to
get
some
that
was
a
little
fresher
came
about
overall
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
brew
despite
being
from
north
carolina
this
was
the
first
duck
rabbit
offering
id
tried
and
i
was
slightly
let
down
it
was
a
unique
take
on
the
style
but
just
tasted
a
little
off
to
me
i
still
look
forward
to
seeking
out
some
more
brews
from
duck
rabbit
though
two
fingers
of
loose
foam
light
tan
in
color
dimples
as
the
bubbles
quickly
pop
most
of
the
lacing
slides
away
easily
dark
brownred
brick
in
color
the
zinc
orange
starts
to
show
around
the
rims
fairly
clear
for
its
level
of
darkness
the
nose
is
decidedly
malty
but
in
no
way
overly
sweet

the
carbonation
has
it
cresting
early
in
the
mouth
but
isnt
disguising
any
flaws
or
such
caramel

and
hard
to

why
enjoyable
enough
but
nothing
especially
noteworthy
d
in
my
opinion
the
high
carbonation
creates
a
barrier
between
me
an
otherwise
perfectly
enjoyable
beer
it
just
seems
off
other
than
that
its
easy
enough
to
drink
12oz
bottle
picked
up
in
nc
last
weekend
the
beer
is
darkly
clear
a
translucent
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
foam
that
laces
into
solid
chunks
on
the
glass
it
smells
just
the
way
i
want
a
brown
ale
to
roasted
malts
and
a
little
chocolate
not
so
much
of
the
hops
from
the
label
hoppy
and
beautifully
bitter
the
beer
tastes
much
hoppier
than
it
smells
the
spicy
hops
maybe
saaz
are
a
nice
counterpoint
to
the
rich
malts
very
well
done
id
like
more
sweetness
from
the
malts
but
they
present
more
with
roasted
bitterness
a
nice
lingering
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
more
from
hops
than
malts
id
guess
a
well
done
beer
but
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
lineup
so
far
overall
a
solid
hoppy
brown
ale
which
is
what
its
supposed
to
be
spot
on
not
a
bad
drinker
another
beer
that
for
me
promised
more
in
the
aroma
than
it
delivered
in
the
taste
but
i
could
see
getting
cozy
with
this
one
having
a
few
over
cards
or
something
drinkability
just
a
fine
and
wellbalanced
beer
that
is
slightly
filling
i
would
gladly
enjoy
more
of
these
especially
as
an
afterdinner
kind
of
drink
drinkability
is
very
good
brewed
for
mass
quantities
nice
flavors
looks
good
would
probably
be
even
better
on
tap
i
would
like
to
see
this
legend

low
down

for
newcastle

bars
and
restaurants

pretty
drinkable
and
definitely
interesting
pours
a
clear
cherry

with
a
small
beige

lasts

few
minutes
minimal
patches
of

aroma
features
citrusy
hops
chocolate

some

mouthfeel

more
carbonation

expected
taste
has
grapefruit

pine

hops
chocolate

lots
of

nice
touch
of
nuttiness
that
tastes
like
hazelnuts
finishes
with
a
pine
hops
bitterness
that
is
fleeting
i
would
estimate
the
abv
to
be
around
5
but
its
not
noticed
a
nicely
executed
brown
ale
that
is
quite
tasty
and
pleasantly
drinkable
d
a
very
good
but
not
great
american
brown
due
to
the
medicinal
bitterness
that
taints

a

i
love
brown

with

this
is
one
of
those
browns
just
the
right
balance
of
malt

hops
slightly
overcarbonated

lowers

me
a

instead
havent

many

yet
but
this
one
i
could
drink
all
night
compared
to
some
others
ive
had
dont
drink
and
review
i
almost
finished
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
im
really
starting
to
appreciate
duck
rabbit
more
and
more
this
was
well
worth
a
try
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
but
my
personal
preference
is
a
little
more
malt
and
a
little
less
hops
d
an
ok
beer
not
particularly
memorable
but
worth
trying
i
could
easily
put
back
a
few
of
these
pours
a
good
moderately
dark
brown
with
some
very
nice
head
too
much
really
and
decent

deep

dark

sweet
finish
with
a
very
nice
american

bite
mixed
in
well
balanced
and
very
smooth
a
great
beer
but
for
the
style
it
seems
a
bit
off
pours
a
nice
brown
with
a
huge
tannish
head
after
letting
it
warm
for
some
time
it
is
quite
nutty
not
overly
so
but
clearly
present
seems
to
be
a
bit
out
of
whack
with
what
almost
seems
like
an
alcohol
burn
odd
still
though
pretty
workable
feel
is
standard
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
how
it
was
intended
and
will
try
again
in
the
future
when
i
have
the
chance
d
easy
going
down
but
not
sure
i
would
buy
this
regularly
even
if
it
were
available
good
but
not
great
12
oz
pretty
dark

large
off
white

i
thought
this
was
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
ive
had
in
a
long
time
aroma
reminds
me
more
of
a
porter
malt
roast
and
nut
a
little
more
floral
taste
also
reminds
me
of
a
porter
but
more
nutty
slightly
more
maltiness
lightmedium

maybe
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
same
as
with
their
porter
very
balanced
not
blown
away
by
nut
tea
or
old
sock
qualities
a
good
drinker
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
brown
nicely
drinkable
not
among
the
best
browns
ive
ever
had
but
still
good
stronger
roasted
malts
good
hops
the
bitter
roasted
malt
flavor
lingers
again
after
the
hopiness
dies
down
some
chocolate
notes
this
one
packs
a
flavorful
punch
its
a
bit
of
a
different
take
on
the
style
but
definitely
worth
a
try
ive
enjoyed
the
other
beers
ive
from
duck
rabbit
so
far
more
at
this
point
though
very
floral
hop
aroma
same
floral
hop
flavor
well
balanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
for
my
taste
with
a
slight
caramel
flavor
up
there
with
the
best
of
other
brown
ales
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
biting
carbonation
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
i
think
if
i
have
a
goto
domestic
brown
this
would
be
it
no
new
ground
is
broken
and
even
though
ive
never
had
this
hoppy
of
a
brown
before
its
still
not
overbearing
and
i
think
ends
up
melding
the
oldschool
and
newschool
if
you
will
quite
well
pours
a
clear
mahagony
brown
color
with
a
big
foamy
light
tan
head
that
resists
fading
a
reasonable
amount
of
belgian
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
is
chalky
necco
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
the
taste
is
nice
but
on
the
edge
of
being
overly
roasted
the
chocolate
notes
in
the
nose
are
also
reflected
in
the
flavor
in
my
case
the
intensity
of
the
lingering
roasted
character
put
me
off
some
thanks
much
to
brentk56
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
md
good
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
unique
flavor
for
a
brown
ale
nice
amount
of
citrus
hop
flavor
a
hoppy
aggressive
american
brown
that
i
say
deserves
your
attention
not
sure
id
session
this
one
all
night
but
a
desert
beer
or
nightcap
seem
about
right
no
secrets
here
per
the
label
hoppy
and
beautifully
bitter
that
may
be
a
nice
escape
from
the
typical
english
style
brown
ale
appears
a
deep
chestnut
mahogany
brown
hue
with
a
light
khaki
head
form
fine
bubbled
even
layers
of
lacing
as
it
dwindles
aroma
has
a
big
nutty
chocolate
tone
with
caramel
and
toffee
blended
in
as
well
but
a
strong
air
of
herbal
and
earthy
hops
is
provided
as
well
flavor
was
raw
with
hop
bitterness
earthy
herbal
hops
was
right
those
nutty
dark
chocolate
tones
are
overshadowed
by
the
wave
of
alpha
hop
bitterness
giving
the
flavor
a
really
dirty
muddled
flavor
overall
sharp
acidity
with
a
back
end
of
sweetness
finishes
very
dry
in
acidic
carbonation
level
is
soft
on
the
mouthfeel
but
body
is
medium
with
a
slight
level
of
oily
hops
at
this
point
just
brew
an
ipa
if
you
want
to
keep
it
a
dark
beer
go
black
with
your
ipa
but
compared
to
terrapin
and
dfhs
versions
of
a
hoppy
brown
this
one
goes
a
bit
overboard
drinkability
is
kinda
hurtin
due
to
the
lack
of
cohesion
of
flavors
abrasive
hops
within
a
traditional
brown
doesnt
work
to
well
fantastic
and
is
bound
to
become
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
a
tasty
brown
that
flows
easy
drinkability
on
this
one
is
high
as
it
wont
get
too
sweet
and
it
isnt
too
hoppy
this
beer
has
complexity
but
doesnt
bash
you
over
the
head
with
it
i
would
pair
this
with
well
just
about
anything
had
a
bottle
at
the
liberty
st
tavern
in
allentown
pa
its
good
to
see
more
duckrabbit
beers
around
appeared
a
clear
brown
with
a
short
tan
head
the
beer
was
very
smooth
with
a
mix
of
candy
caramel
and
cocoa
malt
flavors
mixed
into
a
balanced
body
its
not
too
dry
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
sweet
just
a
good
sessionable
brown
ale
extremely
drinkable
great
session
ale
d
a
hop
lovers
brown
ale
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
solid
and
respectable
there
isnt
necessarily
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
but
there
would
have
to
be
a
pretty
weak
selection
for
this
to
be
my
drink
of
choice
at
one
of
the
local
bars
for
the
style
and
overall
i
just
find
it
lacking
in
aroma
and
taste
complexity
but
i
will
give
this
another
try
in
hope
that
this
bottle
was
just
past
its
prime
drinking
duckrabbit
brown
ale
brought
to
mind
burgers
and
fries
drenched
in
malt
vinegar
it
would
go
very
nicely
with
a
sloppy
cookout
meal
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
one
that
i
would
really
recommend
to
many
folks
lacked
a
certain
richness
perhaps
i
was
nervous
the
date
would
bring
down
this
beer
after
smelling
it
but
the
taste
was
quite
good
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
i
would
go
back
for
more
d
a
nicely
balanced
and
slightly
bitter
brown
ale
with
a
low
abv
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
good
for
a
gander
need
to
try
it
on
tap
to
compare
i
am
not
in
love
with
this
not
bad
nothing
wrong
with
it
for
me
the
flavor
is
understated
as
i
said
the
mouthfeel
here
is
medium
bodied
and
soft
it
has
a
good
quenching
quality
to
it
and
its
juicy
good
carbonation
refined
and
lazy
i
think
the
beer
keeps
it
interesting
enough
though
i
would
never
claim
this
as
my
favorite
american
brown
ale
this
is
modest
in
many
ways
which
is
good
for
some
beers
bad
for
others
here
i
will
consider
it
a
good
thing
pours
surprisingly
clear
brown
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
falls
to
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
fairly
conventional
roasted
with
notes
of
coffee
and
wood
it
is
in
the
flavor
where
the
surprise
comes
it
is
at
once
thin
and
mouthfilling
with
a
deep
bitterness
that
develops
slowly
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
foretaste
has
chicory
wood
coffee
dark
caramel
but
then
the
flavor
dies
off
quickly
at
first
i
was
disappointed
thinking
the
beer
was
weak
and
inadequate
but
moments
later
that
rich
spicy
bitterness
comes
up
and
spreads
across
the
tongue
it
tastes
like
the
hop
bitterness
of
a
good
ipa
but
with
a
slightly
harder
edge
and
some
of
the
burn
of
of
an
exotically
spiced
middle
eastern
or
indian
dish
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
clingy
and
has
a
good
bite
of
carbonation
this
was
my
first
of
the
duckrabbit
brews
and
being
a
north
carolinian
im
proud
of
this
one
a
sixer
that
will
make
it
to
my
fridge
more
often
as
always
an
excellent
abovepar
beer
from
duckrabbit
d
moderately
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
best
of
both
worlds
in
this
one
dark
beer
with
an
excellent
hop
presence
d
above
average
beer
and
very
sessionable
but
not
a
very
complex
beer
would
certainly
drink
again
but
wouldnt
be
a
brown
i
would
make
a
point
to
go
out
and
find
drinkability
this
was
a
way
bitter
brown
most
likely
the
most
bitter
i
have
had
a
little
too
hoppy
for
my
liking
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
what
i
had
from
duck
rabbit
i
will
not
search
for
this
again
i
prefer
my
brown
ales
less
hoppy
the
dry
hop
quality
and
the
toast
almost
roasty
presence
seem
to
emphasize
each
other
in
a
way
that
makes
both
a
bit
more
dry
and
unpleasant
overall
this
is
a
hoppy
brown
thats
tasty
though
i
wish
the
malts
had
more
of
a
presence
after
the
dubious
start
this
becomes
a
very
assertive
brew
i
want
a
little
more
malt
in
the
finish
but
this
has
a
nice
roasted
aspect
to
the
bitterness
that
offsets
the
hops
and
adds
to
my
enjoyment
ontap
during
my
first
visit
to
foundation
served
in
a
tall
skinny
pint
glass
a
nice
crisp
brown
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
that
left
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
was
a
nice
blend
of
citrus
hops
with
a
touch
of
pine
and
nice
sweet
malts
backing
it
up
the
taste
was
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
hops
and
caramel
malts
the
beer
was
light
and
refreshing
with
smooth
carbonation
this
had
long
been
my
favorite
year
round
duck
rabbit
beer
and
it
certainly
does
not
disappoint
on
draft
body
is
medium
carbonation
is
appropriate
finish
is
pretty
dry
quite
tasty
and
another
quality
offering
from
the
duckrabbit
the
taste
leaves
a
little
nutty
flavor
that
is
nice
not
very
drinkable
but
good
md
thin
bodied
verging
on
watery
just
not
quite
there
easy
drinking
though
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
body
behind
it
this
taste
real
good
nice
caramel
malts
theres
something
else
almost
vanilla
or
some
oakiness
to
it
and
then
theres
a
nice
bright
hoppy
finish
nice
complexity
for
such
a
low
abv
if
youre
looking
for
alot
of
flavor
and
not
much
alcohol
you
this
is
your
beer
nice
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
this
is
an
awesome
session
brew
okay
now
that
we
are
getting
dr
in
knoxville
now
and
have
met
a
few
of
the
staff
from
dr
here
and
at
sexual
choc
release
this
continues
to
be
my
beer
of
choice
for
a
premium
beer
but
not
high
grav
i
love
this
brown
ale
just
right
amount
of
hop
smoothness
of
a
brown
ale
and
very
drinkable
like
someone
said
in
a
previous
review
monster
head
so
pour
carefully
i
hope
this
beer
lasts
longer
than
the
outdoor
rabbits
in
the
cage
of
my
chinese
neighbor
more
are
missing
every
month
dsave
the
mouthfeel
this
brew
is
quite
unique
due
to
the
healthy
hop
dose
a
nice
hybrid
beer
with
the
malty
characteristics
in
a
brown
you
would
expect
with
a
kick
of
hops
to
make
it
american
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
and
flavourful
brew
d
very
drinkable
this
goes
down
very
well
i
really
look
forward
to
trying
theie
other
offerings
d
this
is
a
decent
example
of
a
brown
ale
its
pretty
well
made
and
easy
to
drink
very
tasty
and
unique
brown
if
they
would
only
lower
the
carbonation
a
bit
this
would
be
a
beer
id
go
to
often
fp
flavor
is
initially
sharp
bitter
followed
by
a
malty
mid
palate
featuring
toasty
bready
notes
with
a
definite
roasted
flavor
citrus
hops
come
in
to
wash
out
the
malt
and
it
finishes
bitter
and
somewhat
astringentminerally
medium
body
and
ample
carbonation
overall
its
somewhat
perplexing
as
the
different
flavors
seem
to
step
on
each
other
and
the
finish
becomes
unpleasant
at
times
d
fairly
drinkable
id
love
to
try
this
fresh
d
drinkability
is
good
stays
smooth
and
goes
down
quite
easy
this
one
could
really
shine
if
not
for
the
excessive
carbonation
not
sure
if
this
is
really
what
the
brew
is
supposed
to
be
like
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
another
one
of
these
just
to
test
out
my
carbonation
theory
if
i
am
right
then
this
one
would
be
worth
the
effort
to
track
down
again
this
one
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
and
the
foamy
tan
head
that
accompanies
the
pour
hangs
around
for
the
entire
life
of
the
beverage
smells
of
dark
ripe
fruit
coffee
nuts
and
alcohol
are
certainly
discernible
but
the
strong
presence
of
dark
malts
is
not
to
be
ignored
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
espresso
and
bittersweet
chocolate
the
bitter
hops
at
the
finish
is
strong
and
easily
reminds
one
of
the
many
indian
brown
ales
so
much
in
vogue
these
days
its
a
bit
dry
for
the
creamy
brown
ales
im
familiar
with
but
thats
not
a
mark
against
it
my
only
complaint
is
the
high
carbonation
just
a
little
too
much
fizz
for
my
taste
this
was
my
least
favorite
offering
from
duck
rabbit
as
i
have
been
very
pleased
with
the
rest
of
their
brews
im
not
sure
what
the
deal
was
with
the
foam
but
i
dont
think
she
spoiled
was
ok
beer
but
i
have
had
far
better
browns
overall
a
nice
beer
a
nice
little
brown
ale
that
was
quite
tasty
and
i
would
certainly
purchase
this
beer
more
often
if
it
were
near
me
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
carbonated
it
gets
better
once
you
work
out
some
of
that
carbonation
via
swirling
overall
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
although
i
prefer
less
of
a
roasty
presence
or
none
at
all
in
a
brown
ale
pours
the
dark
dark
brown
with
the
typical
massive
dr
head
that
almost
comes
out
of
the
glass
retention
and
lacing
are
very
good
the
aroma
is
an
interesting
balance
between
the
citrus
hops
and
the
sweet
caramel
malts
the
taste
has
the
same
caramel
malts
but
with
more
noticeable
chocolate
and
nut
tastes
to
go
along
with
it
the
citrus
hops
show
up
and
give
the
finish
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
of
course
highly
carbonated
this
is
a
decent
brew
from
dr
and
i
do
like
the
hop
presence
that
balances
out
the
malts
well
recommended
overall
very
interesting
its
more
hoppy
than
your
average
brown
ale
but
not
to
the
point
of
being
too
hopped
up
if
you
like
brown
ales
andor
ipas
youll
like
this
i
think
that
this
beer
is
better
served
cold
and
the
smell
is
better
than
the
taste
served
in
a
pint
glass
its
dark
but
clear
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
nose
is
gentle
malts
taste
is
malts
slight
alcohol
and
some
dry
fruits
mouthfeel
is
very
good
full
and
nice
drinkability
is
great
nice
simple
brew
pours
a
light
molasses
with
a
big
bubble
three
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
slowly
dies
down
to
a
thin
frothy
layer
solid
lacing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
begins
with
a
full
nutty
aroma
with
some
brown
sugar
light
floral
hops
and
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
tingle
the
nose
as
well
theres
also
the
slightest
bit
of
a
metallic
smell
which
im
not
too
fond
of
fortunately
its
not
strong
enough
to
overpower
the
other
excellent
aromas
taste
starts
off
with
sweet
caramelized
almonds
and
and
toasted
malts
midway
is
some
earthy
and
piney
hops
with
some
cane
sugar
aftertaste
is
woody
and
a
bit
dry
medium
body
with
a
creamy
feel
carbonation
is
a
bit
of
a
distraction
seeing
its
slightly
over
the
top
but
this
is
still
a
very
well
crafted
brown
ale
the
low
abv
and
full
flavor
makes
this
a
very
enjoyable
session
beer
thanks
again
grant
for
some
reason
i
didnt
write
down
who
i
got
this
from
thanks
to
whoever
it
was
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
sticks
around
aroma
of
nuts
some
caramel
and
a
little
chocolate
tastes
like
roasted
malts
a
little
caramel
and
some
hops
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
and
well
carbonated
i
know
brown
ales
are
generally
supposed
be
simple
and
i
like
that
about
them
but
this
one
definitely
leaves
me
wanting
more
complexity
bummer
lightly
sticky
in
the
mouth
coating
lingering
it
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
barely
transparent
with
a
fairly
persistent
offwhite
head
aroma
is
rich
and
rather
malty
with
some
hop
undertone
and
hints
of
spice
flavor
is
surprisingly
hoppy
and
fairly
but
not
unpleasantly
bitter
there
is
some
maltiness
and
a
touch
of
spice
texture
is
fairly
smooth
d
very
impressive
take
on
the
style
bottle
described
it
as
hoppy
and
beautifully
bitter
i
agree
whole
heartedly
on
this
one
but
not
sure
how
many
i
could
have
ain
a
sitting
will
search
it
out
again
sometime
dpretty
darn
good
i
was
able
to
try
this
during
a
tasting
with
some
friends
duckrabbit
has
an
interesting
logo
i
saw
the
duck
first
so
does
that
make
me
a
creative
person
dr
calls
itself
the
dark
beer
specialists
and
they
call
the
brown
ale
hoppy
and
beautifully
bitter
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
thin
tan
head
good
carbonation
with
a
little
bit
of
a
fruity
nutty
aroma
is
it
apricot
the
hoppiness
and
bitterness
are
definitely
there
i
usually
pour
strong
but
be
careful
with
this
one
as
that
style
pour
equaled
an
over
four
finger
biscuit
like
rocky
tan
head
that
actually
jumps
out
of
the
glass
body
is
the
blackest
of
browns
showing
only
brown
hints
on
the
edges
nose
is
musky
with
a
crisp
mineraly
spice
profile
that
leans
twords
peppery
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
brashly
attacks
the
tongue
with
first
sip
with
crisp
backed
green
apples
and
strong
raw
biscuity
spice
mingled
with
a
bitter
sour
feel
a
long
dark
burnt
malty
feel
stays
long
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
raw
mineral
laced
bitter
bite
almost
has
a
nutty
feel
a
solid
brown
ale
that
does
not
have
any
frilly
sweetness
that
seems
like
it
was
added
just
for
sweetness
sake
nicely
drinkable
and
unique
this
is
a
delicious
and
expectationbending
brown
ale
it
poured
with
a
big
offwhite
head
and
a
deep
brown
body
the
smell
was
an
intoxicating
mix
of
rich
malt
and
strong
hops
the
taste
was
a
rich
and
complex
mix
of
mild
caramel
malt
strong
and
complex
american
and
european
hop
flavor
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
on
the
finish
saaz
finishing
hops
in
a
brown
ale
brilliant
probably
one
of
the
better
brown
ales
ive
had
and
my
introduction
to
this
brewery
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
rest
now
this
is
very
well
done
and
quite
drinkable
i
seriously
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
one
that
has
a
low
enough
abv
to
drink
all
night
a
good
everyday
beer
d
not
bad
in
the
flavor
department
but
i
think
this
beer
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
and
thin
however
i
like
how
the
hops
and
malts
interact
here
resulting
in
quite
a
bitter
brown
ale
with
a
nice
complex
taste
and
aroma
it
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
with
a
huge
foamy
head
it
demonstrates
a
full
hoppy
flavor
coming
from
amarillo
and
saaz
hops
it
had
a
fabulous
aroma
and
equally
pleasing
flavor
not
an
english
brown
but
a
hoppedup
american
brown
first
wort
hopping
raises
the
ibus
without
creating
an
overpowering
hop
aroma
or
bitterness
resulting
in
a
more
balanced
beer
came
across
this
ale
while
in
corolla
nc
on
vacation
as
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
and
generally
darker
beers
i
felt
i
should
give
it
a
try
out
of
a
bottle
the
ale
reeked
of
strong
dark
malts
upon
tasting
the
flavor
in
terms
of
sheer
strength
and
persistence
nearly
knocked
me
out
of
my
preverbial
socks
the
dark
chocolate
and
nutmeg
malts
are
everlingering
and
almost
hard
to
notice
anything
over
the
other
characteristics
of
the
beer
i
feel
are
masked
by
the
absolutely
intense
malt
flavor
hopping
is
decent
but
not
marked
when
compared
to
malt
flavor
side
by
side
carbonation
is
decent
but
somewhat
high
for
what
i
like
to
see
in
an
ale
of
this
type
drinkability
is
slightly
below
par
to
me
i
would
not
want
to
have
more
than
one
at
any
given
sitting
nothing
stuck
out
to
me
about
this
beer
past
its
overpronounced
maltiness
and
unrefined
hoppiness
i
would
probably
not
purchase
again
that
being
said
if
you
are
looking
for
a
huge
bomb
of
a
dark
ale
this
just
might
be
for
you
c
d
quite
good
i
havent
had
anything
i
havent
liked
by
this
brewery
yet
this
is
78
beers
they
make
that
ive
tried
now
haver
the
8th
sitting
in
the
fridge
and
this
certainly
does
a
nice
job
continuing
the
trend
not
too
heavy
and
pretty
drinkable
as
a
whole
goes
down
nicely
quite
like
it
overall
very
surprised
not
so
much
with
the
brewery
because
they
are
very
consistant
with
their
brews
just
that
i
am
not
too
fond
of
the
style
however
i
found
this
beer
very
enjoyable
great
job
guys
pours
out
a
rusted
nut
shell
with
a
moderate
sized
frothy
head
that
leaves
tons
of
thick
raised
lacing
what
hits
the
nose
first
is
a
very
fresh
and
raw
hop
aroma
courtesy
of
saaz
dryhopping
underneath
this
is
a
backbone
of
malty
aromas
of
brown
sugar
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
maple
flavor
starts
off
with
a
sweet
mix
of
nuts
and
caramel
with
a
back
note
of
roast
malt
the
hops
kick
in
with
some
lemon
rind
and
a
very
herbaltealike
presence
with
some
floral
jasmine
rounding
it
out
finishes
dry
bitter
and
with
a
lingering
hop
presence
in
the
mouth
im
so
used
to
coming
across
overly
sweet
brown
ales
made
in
the
us
that
this
is
one
incredibly
refreshing
example
mouthfeel
is
moderate
without
any
real
residual
sugar
left
on
the
tongue
the
carbonation
compliments
the
hops
very
well
very
drinkable
a
surprise
of
a
brown
ale
for
sure
the
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
satisfying
but
not
too
filling
i
personally
like
the
hoppy
taste
which
is
a
little
bit
more
than
most
of
the
brown
ales
that
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
sample
thus
far
all
said
not
bad
d
a
different
take
on
a
brown
ale
than
im
used
to
pretty
much
what
the
bottle
advertised
i
ended
up
enjoying
the
look
and
smell
of
this
beer
more
than
the
actual
taste
i
like
the
finish
and
aftertaste
but
the
beer
itself
is
too
bitter
carbonated
and
thin
for
me
and
ends
up
tasting
like
a
soda
recommended
a
nice
brown
ale
that
is
unique
enough
to
keep
interesting
body
is
a
little
light
but
the
rich
flavor
and
smooth
drinkability
make
this
more
interesting
then
your
average
brown
drinkability
it
was
alright
but
if
you
think
it
is
going
to
be
like
newcastle
guess
again
very
drinkable
interesting
take
on
the
style
thanks
to
muenchenerkindl
for
sending
this
one
in
my
direction
a
nice
long
almost
warming
finsih
made
this
a
perfect
drink
for
a
cool
fall
night
drinkability
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
very
much
mostly
due
to
the
brashness
of
the
hops
my
palate
adjusted
some
but
not
enough
enjoyed
all
the
duckrabbits
look
forward
to
getting
all
the
reviews
in
after
a
couple
more
of
each
looking
forward
to
having
them
get
these
up
the
east
coast
this
is
hands
down
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
brown
ales
are
usually
so
boring
that
theyre
afterthoughts
but
this
is
one
that
i
would
drink
again
and
again
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
regularly
awesome
brew
thanks
again
kevin
d
this
would
make
for
a
good
session
ale
im
not
a
huge
brown
ale
fan
so
i
probably
wouldnt
go
back
to
it
but
its
a
decent
example
of
the
style
d
the
taste
is
big
but
the
alcohol
isnt
that
being
said
i
can
see
more
than
a
bottle
or
two
being
too
much
on
the
tastebuds
well
5
minutes
later
and
i
finnally
have
it
all
in
my
glass
first
smell
gives
me
a
somewhat
boozy
impression
this
is
replaced
with
a
sweet
malty
note
and
some
nutty
undertones
i
still
cant
get
through
the
head
to
get
a
taste
of
this
thing
finnally
i
get
a
sip
that
isnt
all
foam
and
its
not
bad
again
some
nutty
undertones
with
a
big
malt
base
strong
nutty
aftertaste
carbonation
level
is
high
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
who
wants
to
wait
10
minutes
to
be
able
get
though
the
foam
and
taste
it
ok
but
not
worth
the
trouble
clear
brown
color
with
a
strong
pillowy
offwhite
head
smell
is
roasty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
plenty
of
earthy
hop
aroma
taste
is
earthy
in
the
beginning
but
gains
a
nice
nuttiness
in
the
middle
lingering
nuttiness
and
roast
in
the
finish
that
is
quite
nice
high
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
pretty
nice
beer
but
there
are
just
a
few
things
that
take
away
from
what
it
could
be
the
lingering
aftertaste
is
awesome
but
it
isnt
that
great
for
me
when
it
hits
the
tongue
and
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
quite
on
for
me
worth
a
try
you
may
love
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
lots
and
lots
of
carbonation
huge

finger
plus

also
found

it
still
made
enjoyable

d
not
exactly
what
id
reach
for
if
looking
for
a
brown
ale
there
was
nothing
timid
about
this
which
presented
a
problem
with
all
those
flavor
characteristics
coming
together
pushed
forth
by
a
surge
of
bubbles
it
seems
to
miss
the
mark
for
any
brown
ale
american
or
otherwise
balance
seemed
too
far
out
yet
oddly
i
feel
like
waiting
a
year
or
so
and
trying
this
one
again
just
to
see
if
i
taste
it
differently

the
best
brown
ive
had
to

to
wish
this

was

pick
this

up
if
yourre
lucky
enough
to
run
across
it
hell
send
me
some
too
d
very
drinkable
beer
just
not
very
pourable
good
flavor
good
smell
but
they
need
to
tone
the
carbonation
back
a
bit
thanks
to
limesmut
for
this
beer
via
trade
drank
good
but
too
much
coffee
wouldve
made
more
sense
a
mocha
porter
imo
if
you
love
coffee
flavors
in
your
beer
this
your
brown
ale
of
choice
didnt
know
style
when
i
tried
it
but
was
pretty
sure
it
wasnt
an
english
brown
ale
way
too
hoppy
i
am
having
trouble
getting
past
the
carbonation
and
the
hops
both
could
be
toned
down
to
allow
other
aspects
of
the
beer
to
shine
through
rubyred
and
brown
at
the
same
time
head
is
very
healthy
fluffy

at
first
and
then
malts
the
smell
is
not
bad
by
any
means
in
fact
it
is
quite
good
it
tastes
like
roasted
malts
and
is

on

not
what

a

about

of
roasted

by

hit
of

and
a
touch

much
so
that
i
find

about
anything
else
while
drinking
it
got
this
one
in

smell
is
burnt
malt
followed
by
a
slighty
sweet
citrusy
note
this
is
a
unique
aroma
for
me
the
taste
is
bitter
both
from
the
roasted
malt
a
coffelike
bitter
and
the
hops
citrus
there
is
little
sweetness
and
that
makes
this
seems
very
unbalanced
to
me
but
i
find
it
quite
tasty
nonetheless
and
very
drinkable
as
well
d
didnt
realize
the
abv
until
after
i
finished
a
very
drinkable
brown
but
a
little
higher
wouldnt
hurt
d
actually
after
a
couple
of
these
i
would
be
full

it
tastes
great

thick

the
taste
was

the
predominant
flavors
very
complex
though
as
there
was
much
hoppiness
at
both
the
beginning
and
the
finish
the
finish
was
very
nice

looking

here
have
not

my

so
look
for
that
tomorrow
and
of

another
fine

this
looked
like
a
pretty
standard
brown
ale
with
a
good
sized
head
and
clear
dark
brown
color
the
nose
was
a
mixture
of
sweet
malts
and
floral
hops
those
floral
hops
were
slightly
offputting
i
think
the
late
hop
additions
need
to
be
cut
back
the
taste
moved
as
i
swallowed
from
typical
slightly
sweet
and
bitter
brown
ale
to
an
attack
of
flowery
hops
at
the
end
it
seemed
a
bit
of
place
and
as
the
glass
warmed
up
the
floral
hops
became
a
bit
overpowering

bugs
me
a

and
makes
it
less
drinkable

if
i
wasnt
in
the
mood
for
a
murphys

id
defintely
drink
this
excellent
american
brown
ale
a
few
of
these
would
be
ok
with
me
i
think
this
could
be
great
if
they
cut
down
on
the
charred
maltiness
and
let
the
hops
balance
it
out
when
you
let
it
sit
in
the
mouth
before
swallowing
its
pretty
delicious
but
it
leaves
the
tongue
feeling
scortched

worth
getting
another

will
not

one
out
again
no

this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew

if
it

duckrabbit
brown
ale
is
yet
another
quality
dark
beer
from
the
dark
beer
specialists
these
words
dont
usually
leave
my
fingertips
but
it
would
be
even
better
if
the
malt
load
was
dialed
up
and
the
hop
load
was
dialed
down
just
a
tad
if
bitter
browns
are
your
thing
duckrabbit
has
what
you
seek
not
my
favorite
brown
ale
i
liked
the
dr
milk
stout
better
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
i
will
probably
try
other
drs
a
very
good
example
of
brown
ale
find
it
if
you
can
you
wont
be
disapointed
the
label
is
notched
as
having

my
experience
with
duck
rabbit
brown
ale
was
like
riding
a
roller
coaster
it
pours
a
beautiful
mahogany
with
an
average
head
this
is
definitely
an
attractive
beer
the
aroma
im
almost
embarrased
to
say
that
i
could
only
discern
latex
paint
i
tried
and
tried
i
even
opened
another
bottle
later
and
compared
notes
the
sniffer
was
working
but
this
smelled
like
it
was
brewed
by
sherwin
williams
everything
else
was
impressive
including
the
flavor
of
dark
chocolate
malts
and
a
nice
hint
of
smokiness
in
spite
of
odd
aroma
this
is
actually
a
good
beer
it
would
be
great
with
brie
and
fruit
poured
a
very
nice
shade
of
brown
with
a
very
strong
sustaining
head
nose
is
a
noticeable
of
toasted
malts
taste
is
interesting
more
like
a
stout
than
a
brown
toasted
malts
fade
into
a
nice
blasting
finish
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
almost
creamy
and
is
very
lively
on
the
palate
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
another
nice
beer
from
this
nc
brewery
drinkability
much
better
than
when
i
first
came
across
this
beer
back
in
november
05
this
beer
vexes
me
the
first
one
i
had
was
pretty
pleasant
but
the
one
i
had
tonight
wasnt
anything
special
my
opinion
seemingly
changed
on
every
sip
its
worth
trying
in
any
case

like
the
label
promised
something
in
the
body
and
flavor
is
just
a
little
lacking
but
the
extra
hop
kick
and
everything
else
rounds
it
out
and
makes
for
a
good
sessionable
beer
will
definitely
return
to
this
and
check
out
other
offerings
overall
a
very
tasty
brown
a
little
on
the
hoppy
side
as
the
bottle
suggests
ive
been
very
pleased
with
all
of
the
duckrabbit
beers
i
tried
them
as
soon
as
they
hit
the
stores
earlier
this
year
and
have
been
coming
back
to
them
regularly
ever
since
overall
it
is
decent
but
i
liked
the
other
beers
ive
sampled
from
this
brewery
more
holy
explosive
head
this
was
an
oh
shit
on
the
pour
as
it
foamed
up
about
58
of
the
glass
and
threatened
to
boil
over
in
my
imperial
pint
glass
no
less
took
forever
to
get
the
head
to
die
down
so
i
could
manage
a
taste
pillowy
tan
lace
all
over
the
glass
and

this

this

one

you
sit

a

do
pick
up
some

from

healthy
dose
of
hops
for
a

i
have
been
breaking
away
from
this

and
becoming
more
of
a

this
suits
me
finenicely

will
buy
again

is

i
really
liked
this
one
check
it
out
drinkability
good
with
red

not
terribly
drinkable
because
the

flavor
is
a

its
not
noticed
a

tasty

clearly
an

the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
wanted
to
drink
i
swear
this
beer
is
way
more
sour
on
tap
it
is
probably
a
difference
in
age
of
batch
i
cannot
make
out
the
bottling
date
or
batch
number
the
stamp
is
partially
missing
i
never
had
that
problem
with
the
stickers
anywho
this
is
another
quality
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
they
rarely
disappoint
i
was
hoping
for
more
sour
but
i
still
like
it
a
lot
a
pretty
tasty
sour
authentic
but
doesnt
surpass
the
top
of
its
belgian
counterparts
not
sure
what
category
they
should
move
this
too
but
this
is
in
no
way
an

it
definitely
is

definitely

cannot

at

really
pretty
beer
with
a

though
o
this
is
a
very
straightforward
lightly
sour
ale
i
usually
pass
on
browns
but
this
is
not
your
typical
brown
this
is
a
sour
no
doubt
this
has
session
written
in
big
letters
i
go
for
this
every
summer
but
this
can
be
enjoyed
any
season
not
yer
standard
american
brown
ale
it
does
say
special
right
on
the
label
that
much
is
certain
right
off
the
bat
the
yeast
and
guest
spices
taking
that
bow
of
mea
culpa
however
it
all
seems
to
slowly
work
towards
a
common
goal
of
good
taste
and
whatnot
as
the
cocoa
and
spices
blend
into
the
base
brown
ale
more
or
less
behind
the
scenes
and
the
funk
slowly
but
surely
trails
off
by
the
end
as
usual
this
brewerys
beers
are
pretty
hard
to
categorize
or
pigeonhole
and
well
all
the
power
to
them
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
balance
of
sweetness
and
bready
malt
with
its
funk
and
tartness
on
the
finish
theres
a
tartly
sour
aroma
on
this
the
flavor
has
notes
of
dark
cherries
and
some
tobacco
leaf
great
finish
with
a
bretty
character
than
hangs
out
for
a
chat
interesting
brew
much
more
inspiring
than
this
review
as
a
wild
ale
this
is
a
not
overly
sour
yet
a
nice
beer
to
drink
it
is
sour
enough
to
think
sour
yet
is
fall
on
the
lower
spectrum
of
acidity
sourness
poured
a
auburn
tinted
brown
body
with
one
finger
head
and
lace
patches
the
aroma
could
be
summed
up
in
one
word
sour
but
there
are
other
minor
notes
that
one
can
detect
like
wood
tart
apples
or
cherries
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
beer
has
a
mix
of
these
sweet
and
sour
notes
and
i
tend
to
gravitate
towards
these
rather
than
traditional
sour
ales
so
this
beer
was
mighty
fine
to
me
sour
tart
cherries
still
think
i
picked
up
apple
along
with
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
balance
together
and
go
down
smooth
in
a
woody
oaky
body
all
in
all
an
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
beer
o
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
experience
unusual
tarty
cool
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
nice
interesting
tart
ale
good
flavor
and
easydrinking
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
pleasantly
surprising
this
trip
down
memory
lane
of
revisiting
all
the
jolly
pumpkin
beers
has
been
time
and
money
well
spent
all
of
their
stuff
is
awesome
maybe
none
more
unique
than
this
one
a
tart
brown
ale
with
orange
peel
cacao
and
cinnamon
all
of
which
are
subtle
but
definite
hazy
light
brown
ambery
glow
heady
as
can
be
bone
white
and
patient
the
nose
is
just
like
the
finish
an
odd
relationship
we
dont
often
see
but
its
loaded
with
orange
peel
citrusy
tart
acidic
yet
dry
very
clean
and
refreshing
this
one
may
be
a
bit
light
for
winter
even
as
a
brown
i
taste
powdery
cocoa
chocolate
malt
buttery
cacao
zesty
citrus
fruits
wild
yeasts
and
brett
all
over
the
shop
and
only
minimal
cinnamon
just
enough
to
make
it
puzzling
very
light
malt
flavor
but
there
is
a
lot
of
body
in
this
made
luxurious
on
the
palate
by
tiny
tickling
bubbles
similar
to
other
beers
from
jolly
pumpkin
but
rounder
and
softer
from
the
cacao
all
orange
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
brown
malt
and
a
memorable
zest
of
refreshment
a
summer
brown
i
think
but
maybe
more
versatile
with
the
cinnamon
their
yeasts
kick
butt
and
so
does
this
beer
cant
recall
anything
even
resembling
this
one
a
good
funky
beer
that
is
probably
a
tad
too
old
to
show
what
it
was
originally
made
of
still
can
imagine
a
underlying
strong
belgian
ale
more
of
it
would
do
it
good
still
pretty
complex

this

another
damn
fine
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
this
is
something
that
could
be
thrown
back
beer
after
beer
after
beer
you
must
understand
however
this
is
far
from
an
american
brown
ale
it
may
have
started
as
a
brown
ale
with
some
caramel
and
munichtype
malts
but
the
oak
barrel
aging
and
wild
yeast
strains
have
turned
this
beer
into
a
fullfledged
american
wild
ale
funky
dry
and
mildly
tart
characteristic
of
many
beers
being
churned
out
by
jolly
pumpkin
o
honestly
this
is
not
my
favorite
by
jolly
pumpkin
however
i
think
i
want
to
give
it
another
try
and
track
down
a
much
fresher
bottle
to
compare
o
went
with
this
8
50
small
pour
at
the
prohibition
taproom
for
my
first
beer
during
pbw
shouldve
went
with
the
obscura
for
price
but
still
an
ok
beer
different
take
on
a
brown
ale
with
the
sour
part
once
i
smelled
the
beer
i
though
i
was
in
for
a
real
delight
but
unfortunately
the
beer
did
not
deliver
as
i
hoped
i
might
of
been
disappointed
if
i
payed
full
retail
for
this
the
taste
is
sweet
at
first
with
tangy
fruit
and
gentle
sour
aspect
and
some
wild
yeast
flavor
with
mild
toast
from
the
malt
with
woody
dry
and
mild
moist
raisin
in
the
linger
with
hints
of
spice
but
cacao
and
cinnamon
are
hard
to
pick
up
out
especially
over
the
barrel
and
wild
yeast
acidity
this
is
a
decent
brown
with
sour
flavor
but
feel
and
aroma
are
slightly
better
than
the
taste
with
decent
drinkability
but
alcohol
is
noticeable
o
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
i
was
unsure
about
this
from
the
first
taste
but
as
it
warmed
it
began
to
grow
on
me
funky
and
tart
but
not
as
spiced
as
i
expected
its
not
a
fantastic
beer
but
i
like
the
approach
jolly
pumpkin
took
on
this
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
considering
the
price
overallnot
a
drainer
but
i
would
not
buy
again
at
16
for
a
big
bottle
not
worth
it
much
cheaper
sour
beers
with
more
flavor
out
there
o
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
probably
one
of
my
least
favorite
jolly
pumpkins
that
isnt
a
diss
because
ive
liked
all
of
them
quite
a
bit
the
taste
was
a
bit
weak
upfront
but
it
had
a
pleasantly
spicy
citrusy
aftertaste
that
lingered
nicely
beer
is
with
carbonation
levels
of
mediumhigh
intensity
this
leads
to
a
mouthfeel
that
is
slightly
fizzy
at
first
but
quickly
becoming
smooth
and
foamy
closes
semidry
slightly
puckering
with
little
residual
stickiness
on
the
palate
o
this
brew
couldnt
not
fit
the
style
more
but
its
absolutely
brilliant
i
feel
bad
about
grading
this
one
on
a
curve
as
a
brown
ale
it
sucks
but
as
a
wild
brown
ale
its
crazy
good
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
immediately
drinking
some
and
cellering
a
few
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
nice
brett
notes
on
brown
ale
the
orange
was
a
nice
addition
hear
jolly
pumpkins
all
taste
the
same
as
a
knock
sometimes
myself
i
enjoy
the
funky
notes
in
all
there
brews
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
liked
it
more
while
it
was
cooler
and
the
brett
was
subdued
so
the
other
characteristics
could
come
out
as
it
warmed
up
and
breathed
it
became
much
more
dry
and
brett
heavy
i
enjoyed
it
cool
so
i
cooled
the
rest
down
after
my
curiosity
was
sufficed
to
bring
back
some
of
the
other
flavors
great
beer
pricy
but
worth
trying
since
i
cant
get
it
back
home
in
tx
o
very
nice
i
would
get
this
again
o
a
must
try
for
the
belgian
brew
advocate
who
thinks
hesshes
had
all
belgian
brews
available
not
as
strong
as
i
would
expect
abv
wise
but
the
flavor
and
experience
is
there
a
must
have
for
those
jolly
pumpkin
fans
especially
on
tap
overall
id
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
jp
brews
ive
tried
would
definitely
order
it
again
a
great
seasonal
it
smells
amazing
but
the
flavor
didnt
back
it
up
fairly
bitter
for
the
style
overall
a
excellent
beer
but
to
little
on
the
brown
ale
charactor
and
slighty
more
wild
than
normal
but
hey
whats
normal
cheers
single
finger
head
with
excellent
lacing
on
a
murky
copper
body
aroma
of
tart
dark
fruit
caramel
and
toasted
malts
breads
and
candied
citrus
flavor
follows
very
well
with
caramel
candied
fruits
brown
sugar
and
bready
malts
light
to
medium
body
oily
and
light
to
medium
carbonation
almost
has
the
sense
of
a
brown
blended
with
a
sour
beer
by
the
time
i
finished
this
one
i
loved
it
and
wanted
another
a
very
nice
and
complex
brew
its
just
a
little
too
thin
for
me
i
cant
help
but
call
this
a
weird
beer
its
labeled
as
a
brown
ale
yet
it
is
sour
and
brewed
with
cacao
and
cinnamon
this
is
not
a
introductory
beer
because
it
would
take
a
strong
palette
to
appreciate
the
complex
flavors
and
depth
of
this
one
i
almost
dont
feel
worthy
to
appreciate
all
that
this
beer
is
made
of
and
am
greatful
to
have
been
able
to
get
a
bottle
in
texas
where
it
is
not
distributed
yethopefully
bottled
on
12012011
a
light
brown
color
with
some
auburn
notes
quite
a
bit
of
foam
and
carbonation
as
it
wanted
to
foam
out
of
the
bottle
smell
was
really
neat
with
sour
beer
tang
a
bit
of
spice
maybe
cinnamon
and
some
richness
from
the
cocoa
and
brown
malt
the
flavor
is
equally
complex
with
a
fair
bit
of
sourness
and
a
pretty
dry
finish
some
pineapple
notes
in
there
too
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
zippy
overall
a
neat
beer
very
interesting
ideas
that
really
came
together
well
overall
as
always
its
another
weird
wild
ride
from
jolly
pumpkin
overall
a
really
interesting
beer
the
fact
that
it
says
special
brown
ale
on
the
bottle
is
something
that
should
be
noted
it
is
definitely
not
your
typical
brown
ale
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
sour
helles
bock
who
knows
regardless
its
a
really
tasty
beer
o
i
think
i
was
too
jazzed
to
buy
this
beer
for
a
celebration
than
i
was
actually
paying
attention
hence
the
old
bottled
date
regardless
maracaibo
especial
is
pretty
fantastic
shining
with
deep
rich
malt
complexity
funky
yeast
and
a
twist
that
puts
a
unique
and
welcome
spin
on
a
fall
classic
id
love
to
find
this
fresh
and
compare
its
cinnamon
spice
and
cacao
additions
to
the
aged
version
though
overall
a
complex
sipper
worthy
of
being
sipped
and
savored
would
pair
well
with
stronger
cheeses
and
fresh
meats
overall
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
lot
i
think
it
is
misclassified
as
a
simple
brown
ale
and
needs
to
be
set
up
as
a
sour
ale
or
wild
ale
still
i
like
sours
so
i
like
this
beer
bottle
with
dinner
at
home
pours
light
brown
with
heavy
carbonation
and
a
big
fluffy
white
head
sour
aroma
with
hints
of
toffee
candies
light
in
the
mouth
and
a
great
sourness
light
vinegar
pairing
with
an
interesting
toasted
flavor
in
the
malts
and
ever
so
slight
spice
there
is
a
crisp
finish
that
i
assume
comes
from
the
orange
peel
and
spices
this
is
light
and
airy
with
heavy
carbonation
went
amazing
with
saurkraut
and
roasted
pork
one
of
my
favorite
jp
brews
really
nice
tartness
to
it
and
also
a
sour
taste
it
has
a
great
complexity
of
both
a
sweet
and
sour
side
to
it
which
i
really
appreciated
we
also
believed
that
it
has
a
slight
lactic
taste
to
it
as
well
o
this
is
an
excellent
sour
one
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
dubbel
an
american
brown
ale
and
a
flanders
oud
bruin
all
at
once
for
fans
of
sour
ales
i
highly
recommend
maracaibo
especial
it
is
definitely
one
of
jolly
pumpkins
most
unique
and
interesting
efforts
six
of
us
attending
a
beer
tasting
that
i
hosted
in
my
man
cave
pub
gave
this
beer
a
score
of
8
out
of
a
possible
30
for
and
an
average
score
of
1
33
it
ranked
dead
last
out
of
the
12
beers
we
tasted
the
group
of
six
were
divided
evenly
3
that
favored
ipas
and
3
that
favored
stouts
it
actually
was
so
bad
that
no
one
even
finished
the
5
oz
pour
and
a
good
portion
of
it
was
dumped
down
the
drain
it
had
a
very
vinegar
taste
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
i
still
have
another
one
unopened
but
do
i
dare
try
it
o
well
definitely
not
a
brown
ale
thats
for
sure
quite
sour
and
very
little
brown
ale
character
judging
by
the
other
reviews
this
is
supposed
to
be
sour
and
not
a
brown
ale
ah
well
should
have
read
them
before
i
wasted
my
money
on
a
miscategorized
brew
have
a
big
thirsty
towel
handy
when
you
open
this
the
sample
i
opened
fizzed
like
a
bottle
of
champagne
in
the
locker
room
of
the
team
that
just
won
the
world
series
it
pours
a
hazy
mahogany
with
a
very
thick
light
cinnamontan
head
that
settles
down
after
a
bit
aroma
has
a
strong
overtone
of
sour
apple
with
a
little
pear
mixed
in
and
a
malty
hint
flavor
has
a
malty
core
a
strong
overtone
of
sour
apple
and
a
woody
undertone
is
this
a
belgian
or
a
sour
whatever
its
tasty
texture
has
good
tang
and
fizz
though
body
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
lovers
of
sour
ales
should
enjoy
this
one
o
this
beer
is
really
very
interesting
very
unique
combination
of
flavors
and
smells
i
like
the
sourness
and
the
barrel
flavors
in
the
beer
but
it
is
not
the
easiest
to
drink
good
beer
for
sipping
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
im
not
sure
this
beer
should
be
classified
as
an
american
brown
ale
the
barrelaging
spices
and
wild
yeasts
may
take
some
by
surprise
if
they
come
looking
for
a
mild
malty
beer
this
is
a
mild
acidic
beer
an
american
wild
brown
ale
definitely
something
new
and
different
it
reminds
me
that
i
still
have
much
to
learn
o
a
great
introductory
sour
beer
very
complex
and
highly
enjoyable
ive
heard
a
great
deal
of
good
hype
about
jolly
pumpkin
but
my
first
try
at
one
of
their
offerings
was
a
complete
disappointment
i
will
certainly
try
another
of
their
beers
but
i
will
certainly
not
believe
the
hype
again
until
i
taste
the
proof
ps
this
was
the
2011
vintage
at
our
upcoming
tasting
we
will
try
a
4
or
5
year
vertical
so
ill
update
with
my
favorite
beer
is
a
little
chocolatey
and
a
little
lactic
forward
it
is
fine
but
doesnt
blow
me
away
i
might
have
it
again
in
the
future
but
this
isnt
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
the
flavor
has
a
bit
of
dark
cocoa
theres
a
bit
of
light
oak
and
earthiness
toward
the
back
not
nearly
as
much
going
on
as
other
jolly
pumpkin
beers
this
is
more
normal
its
a
pretty
good
brew
but
theres
nothing
there
to
take
the
complexity
to
the
next
level
served
in
a
9oz
snifter
this
beer
poured
some
kind
of
orangebrownpink
hybrid
color
that
i
can
only
really
otherwise
describe
as
imperial
topaz
hazy
with
a
thin
cap
of
delicate
bubbles
on
top
aroma
was
a
bit
subdued
tart
but
actually
pretty
mildly
so
with
soft
notes
of
wood
and
leaves
taste
of
cherries
orange
pith
and
apple
skins
again
like
the
aroma
tart
but
not
overly
so
sour
but
not
lippuckering
oak
and
leafiness
tannins
citrus
and
light
spice
with
the
lightest
dusting
of
cocoa
powder
very
nice
and
complex
mediumbodied
very
drying
very
easily
drinkable
but
nice
to
sip
on
slowly
this
is
kind
of
a
miss
for
me
nothing
bad
at
all
and
quite
enjoyable
though
not
one
of
jps
better
offerings
imo
o
a
good
sour
with
a
tart
finish
and
body
it
was
very
delightful
to
drink
lots
of
bold
flavors
and
a
wonderful
finish
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
jolly
pumpkin
offerings
d
drinkability
all
of
jolly
pumpkins
offerings
are
supremely
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
and
maracaibo
is
no
exception
the
light
sweetness
that
rides
out
the
palate
helps
to
maximize
this
beers
drinkability
as
always
masterfully
done
o
the
weak
palate
hurts
this
beer
more
than
i
would
like
good
beer
that
has
great
other
qualities
o
i
dont
agree
with
categorizing
this
as
a
belgian
strong
dark
granted
it
has
some
belgian
influence
but
lacks
the
major
hallmarks
of
the
style
it
is
an
interesting
brown
ale
with
a
belgian
twist
and
for
that
it
isnt
bad
i
dont
know
what
the
person
who
wrote
the
label
description
was
drinking
but
it
wasnt
this
beer
theres
cocoa
nibs
in
there
could
have
fooled
me
not
good
at
all
especially
considering
i
paid
16
for
the
bottle
no
thank
you
o
a
decent
shot
at
brewing
a
brown
ale
with
brett
yeast
but
im
left
wanting
more
this
is
my
first
jp
and
its
really
an
eyeopener
for
what
this
brewery
is
doing
with
beer
the
beer
orange
hued
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
leaves
copious
lacing
on
the
tulip
glass
the
aroma
brings
more
funk
and
yeast
i
would
expect
nothing
else
from
jolly
pumpkin
the
flavor
introduces
more
than
was
presented
in
the
aroma
cocoa
emerges
along
with
some
tasty
spices
really
smooth
feel
with
a
nice
lingering
funky
aftertaste
good
stuff
i
would
have
this
again
pours
a
nice
brownamber
color
w
orange
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
great
two
finger
cocoa
head
which
sticks
around
for
a
long
time
somewhat
cloudy
w
good
carbonation
and
great
lacing
nose
is
that
of
yeast
malt
cinnamon
orange
some
funk
very
subtle
nose
but
really
nice
and
balancedcomplex
taste
is
similar
although
the
cocoa
makes
an
appearance
and
the
maltfunk
really
come
out
more
very
nice
feel
is
fairly
carbonated
with
a
battle
between
the
funk
and
malt
overall
this
is
a
really
unique
and
excellent
brew
i
would
definitely
buy
and
enjoy
this
again
an
interesting
wrinkle
on
the
style
but
not
a
beer
im
crazy
about
o
bought
this
by
accident
i
do
like
it
but
really
meant
to
pick
up
the
madrugada
obscura
stout
odd
but
i
love
its
unexpected
twists
and
turns
its
unique
but
more
than
that
its
really
lovely
and
drinkable
as
well
superb
notes
im
not
normally
a
huge
fan
of
sours
but
i
can
appreciate
them
this
one
is
nicely
balanced
in
its
approach
the
sourness
is
there
but
its
not
overwhelming
none
of
the
more
subtle
flavors
are
lost
on
its
account
if
anything
maybe
just
a
bit
too
much
orange
peel
overall
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
decide
how
much
you
like
or
dont
like
its
very
different
my
tasting
buddies
and
i
went
back
and
forth
about
it
if
its
infected
or
not
i
liked
it
but
definitely
didnt
love
it
would
not
have
to
get
this
one
again
but
as
i
said
every
new
jolly
pumpkin
is
a
joy
and
i
genuinely
love
the
subtleties
and
intricacies
of
their
different
funky
brews
this
one
ends
up
cleaner
and
way
lighter
than
i
expected
on
the
palate
but
still
has
the
classic
exciting
funk
that
makes
every
jolly
pumpkin
beer
unique
theres
a
reason
theyre
one
of
my
very
favourite
breweries
o
this
was
not
was
i
expected
at
all
but
i
came
away
with
a
very
positive
experience
theres
more
interesting
stuff
going
on
here
than
i
could
have
ever
hoped
for
there
are
some
very
daring
notes
in
this
beer
and
it
all
comes
from
a
very
balanced
yeast
profile
this
beer
is
not
too
funky
at
all
but
the
funk
paints
a
most
complex
picture
over
somewhat
familiar
sensations
this
brew
the
work
of
an
alchemist
the
yeast
is
the
star
where
everything
is
influenced
by
its
presence
is
that
a
familiar
sweetness
i
taste
no
its
stewed
tomatoes
oh
a
nice
salty
sensation
from
the
yeast
or
is
that
green
olives
wait
i
mean
black
ugh
thats
how
this
beer
goes
a
wonderfully
controlled
chaos
of
complexity
o
this
beer
grew
on
me
hugely
in
the
course
of
drinking
this
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
on
the
basis
that
its
simply
delicious
not
that
it
isnt
as
i
would
many
beers
but
rather
that
there
is
enormous
complexity
in
this
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
to
savor
and
ponder
this
is
it
jolly
pumpkin
is
really
catching
my
attention
after
this
reviewing
this
as
a
bsda
is
kinda
weird
as
it
is
rather
funky
very
carbed
big
puffy
billowing
slightly
off
white
head
actual
puffy
lacing
on
the
glass
deep
amber
red
to
brown
color
and
it
is
opaque
nice
lactic
sourness
married
with
some
spice
and
earth
notes
little
bit
of
wood
barrel
is
present
too
the
flavor
is
very
unique
a
blend
of
spice
and
sour
i
can
pick
out
the
cacao
and
maybe
some
allspice
and
others
which
blend
with
the
typical
jp
sour
notes
again
i
can
detect
some
of
the
barrel
flavor
nice
deep
malty
base
backs
all
these
complex
flavors
up
well
even
for
a
well
attenuated
beer
maracaibo
has
nice
body
again
not
what
i
expect
from
a
bsda
but
i
knew
what
to
expect
as
it
is
jp
pretty
damn
good
beer
just
not
a
bsda
ill
have
it
again
i
think
the
thing
that
stands
out
the
most
for
me
on
this
one
is
the
particular
version
of
this
style
feels
incredibly
refreshing
for
such
a
dark
sour
very
impressive
beer
bottle
labeled
blend
4
111910
poured
a
light
brown
with
some
deep
ruby
red
showing
through
in
the
light
into
a
tulip
glass
two
fingers
worth
of
good
head
who
doesnt
like
good
head
aroma
has
some
belgian
funksourness
although
this
one
is
from
dexter
michigan
flavor
is
a
little
sour
too
not
in
a
bad
way
per
say
just
hoping
it
does
not
dominate
and
it
does
not
for
long
as
my
palate
gets
used
to
the
sour
andor
it
warms
the
complexity
of
this
brew
starts
to
come
forth
the
spices
etc
make
for
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
mix
with
the
sour
back
drop
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
on
the
deck
grilling
some
chicken
this
was
my
first
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
looking
foward
to
more
overall
this
was
different
complex
and
very
enjoyable
i
will
definitely
order
this
again
even
a
while
after
drinking
it
it
keeps
popping
back
into
my
mind
as
a
beer
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
soon
overall
a
tasty
brew
these
arent
cheap
so
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
but
it
was
good
to
try
a
little
bit
coarse
on
the
mouthfeel
but
a
really
nice
light
body
really
an
interesting
beer
they
really
take
some
unique
flavors
on
this
and
come
up
with
a
pretty
enjoyable
brown
ale
this
one
is
a
bit
yeasty
after
a
while
but
thats
not
enough
to
break
the
deal
d
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
being
such
a
big
fan
of
saisons
i
probably
like
it
more
than
the
style
should
allow
generally
a
decent
bottle
but
a
bit
underwhelming
considering
the
other
reviews
truthfully
the
bret
is
a
little
stong
moderating
it
out
with
ped
and
other
sour
bacteria
would
do
it
wonders
in
terms
of
balance
o
certainly
an
interesting
beer
and
my
first
try
of
jolly
pumpkin
if
you
like
belgian
strongs
this
is
worth
a
purchase
because
of
the
unique
complexity
overall
good
and
interesting
quite
unique
pours
a
hazy
dark
redbrown
with
orange
edges
big
cream
colored

the
middle
of
which
settles
to
half
an
inch
leaving
a
ridiculous
14
inch
thick
sheet
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
a
lot
of
spices
upfront
sort
of
peppery
but
also
pie
spices
cinnamon
and
something
else
a
whiff
of
cocoa
brown
sugar
slight
lemon
rind
component
not
quite
haybarnyard
but
you
can
tell
its
going
to
get
funky
warms
a
bit
and
youre
there
taste
barnyard
funkiness
citrus
rind
a
bit
cidery
cinnamon
brown
sugar
sweet
heavy
on
the
spices
a
bit
funky
with
a
light
sourness
nov
release
so
has
about
6
months
on
it
interesting
and
would
be
a
huge
step
up
from
the
usual
slate
of
spiced
and
pumpkin
beers
that
come
out
in
the
fall
batch
349
o
boy
was
this
interesting
the
spices
are
incredible
and
dominate
the
overall
flavors
but
its
a
nice
drink
and
its
pretty
smooth
if
you
let
it
sit
o
this
is
a
solid
sour
that
is
worth
the
money
this
is
my
third
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
it
is
just
as
good
as
the
others
i
have
this
beer
is
tasty
but
it
had
a
pretty
hefty
price
tag
associated
with
it
it
was
a
great
celebratory
drink
sour
with
belgian
spice
and
funk
i
shared
the
bottle
with
someone
as
interested
in
good
beer
as
me
and
heard
great
responses
i
would
love
to
try
this
brewerys
other
beers
but
only
when
im
ready
to
shell
out
15
for
a
pint
and
a
half
overall
easy
to
drink
tasty
and
strong
enough
to
keep
you
happy
will
have
again
drink
nice
beer
but
for
the
1st
beer
i
have
had
from
jolly
pumpkin
i
was
a
bit
let
down
i
wanted
more
sour
and
felt
the
taste
was
a
bit
tame
probably
wont
come
back
to
this
one
o
this
is
the
second
sour
that
i
have
ever
had
it
is
quite
different
than
the
first
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
like
it
it
is
very
different
than
other
belgian
strong
ales
but
at
the
same
time
so
musch
the
same
i
am
digging
it
overall
this
isnt
quite
as
complex
as
the
bottle
made
it
sound
but
it
is
a
very
drinkable
sour
beer
pours
a
copperamber
colour
with
incredibly
huge
white
head
lots
of
lacing
around
the
glass
great
head
retention
smells
quite
spicy
with
some
barnyard
funk
there
too
some
sour
vinegar
flavour
and
i
think
i
get
some
more
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
really
big
carbonation
level
this
is
a
nice
beer
fairly
sour
and
yeasty
pours
a
reddish
brown
w
a
good
three
fingers
of
head
head
is
thick
and
quite
persistent
smell
starts
off
with
some
sour
notes
particularly
green
apple
this
is
followed
by
some
nice
bready
malts
and
a
decent
amount
of
funk
very
pleasant
smell
taste
starts
out
with
a
bit
of
mustiness
followed
by
tart
green
apple
also
got
a
bit
of
cocoa
on
the
aftertaste
which
was
interesting
and
perfect
for
fall
taste
also
includes
some
definite
breadiness
and
a
bit
of
orange
as
well
this
is
easily
one
of
the
more
complex
tasting
jolly
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
mouthfeel
is
nice
pretty
light
and
highly
carbonated
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
though
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
profile
eventually
caught
up
with
me
making
a
750
a
bit
too
much
very
nice
offering
cheers
serving
type
ontap
in
a
23oz
beer
glass
overall
i
enjoy
this
for
its
unique
take
on
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
its
been
aging
for
awhile
both
on
the
wf
shelf
and
in
the
closet
and
i
hope
it
hasnt
lost
too
much
potency
but
a
funk
bomb
it
is
and
a
wildly
exotic
one
at
that
this
beer
pours
slightly
cloudy
with
a
reddishbrown
color
and
a
two
finger
off
white
foam
that
remains
for
a
good
amount
of
time
the
aromas
immediately
conjur
memories
of
belgian
strong
ales
ive
previously
had
bold
scents
of
sour
and
spice
warm
my
nose
as
i
drink
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
follows
the
beer
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
sourness
from
the
nose
is
accentuated
by
touches
of
citrus
and
tart
the
beer
is
thin
and
smooth
but
not
watery
the
bitter
sour
and
citrusy
flavors
linger
at
the
back
and
sides
of
my
mouth
surprised
that
the
cacao
was
almost
absent
from
the
beer
as
it
was
highlighted
on
the
bottle
could
be
that
i
was
expecting
something
i
shouldnt
have
been
from
that
description
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
that
grows
on
me
as
i
continue
to
drink
it
check
out
this
beer
o
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorites
from
j
p
and
i
really
like
all
of
their
beers
that
i
have
tried
very
very
nice
i
may
have
to
find
a
bottle
or
two
to
lay
down
for
a
while
im
sure
it
would
continue
to
improve
d
interesting
ill
give
it
that
ive
never
had
a
sour
brown
ale
but
this
seemed
like
an
amalgam
of
styles
that
somehow
all
worked
together
or
at
least
for
the
most
part
im
glad
to
have
tried
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
it
again
though
i
am
interested
in
trying
more
from
this
brewery
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
not
at
all
what
i
expect
from
the
label
and
description
on
the
front
but
quite
pleased
not
pleased
however
if
you
take
in
the
price
on
this
thing
bit
on
the
expensive
and
im
not
sure
why
side
d
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
great
and
interesting
flavor
i
think
this
is
a
very
easy
going
beer
i
would
recommend
giving
this
one
a
shot
i
really
enjoyed
it
opretty
good
i
like
jolly
pumpkins
selections
the
old
mission
brew
pub
is
beautiful
and
id
gladly
go
back
to
try
something
else
this
was
bought
local
but
i
always
look
around
glassware
tumbler
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
with
all
of
the
interesting
flavors
but
its
really
easy
to
drink
because
any
traces
of
alcohol
are
well
hidden
im
not
sure
how
much
i
really
like
this
beer
i
definitely
like
it
a
lot
but
part
of
it
may
be
because
of
its
uniqueness
a
good
tasting
brew
very
interesting
very
strong
malts
in
there
with
a
spiciness
from
the
yeasts
it
has
notes
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
the
roasted
and
bready
malts
it
has
a
mild
sourness
to
it
that
is
somewhat
dominated
by
brett
and
pedio
d
this
bottle
was
easy
to
finish
looking
forward
to
trying
it
on
tap
at
ebf
i
really
love
jolly
pumpkin
ive
decided
check
out
this
beer
from
a
relatively
under
appreciated
brewery
notes
hmmm
subtle
at
best
around
those
cacao
cinnamon
and
sweet
orange
peel
insinuations
not
a
bad
brew
lower
tier
from
those
ive
tried
from
jolly
pumpkin
though
d
pretty
good
not
too
bad
i
liked
it
but
i
think
it
would
wear
me
down
over
the
course
of
multiple
pours
not
the
best
i
have
had
from
jolly
pumpkin
but
far
from
the
worst
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
different
tasting
from
other
jolly
pumpkin
beers
although
the
appearance
and
nose
are
similar
this
beer
has
the
most
complex
spice
structure
ive
ever
experienced
very
drinkable
and
would
be
nice
to
drink
on
a
cool
fall
night
not
too
sour
especially
once
acclimated
this
is
more
of
an
earth
nutty

its
nice

myself

gotta
love

scent
some
sour
notes
with
a
lot
of
funk
and
spice
some
fruit
notes
as
well
as
the
beer
warms
i
pick
up
faint
aromas
of
cinnamon
too
taste
is
very
jolly
pumpkin
like
as
well
i
get
a
lot
of
citrus
and
orange
peel
as
well
as
tasty
spices
i
get
a
lot
of
pepper
in
the
finish
there
is
some
nice
barnyard
funk
to
this
beer
as
well
along
with
sour
brett
flavors
i
didnt
know
a
beer
that
was
slightly
sour
and
very
spicy
could
taste
this
good
although
not
an
extremely
high
abv
beer
the
alcohol
definitely
makes
itself
known
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
flavorful
with
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
fairly
high
as
the
alcohol
flavor
takes
it
down
just
a
bit
another
tasty
beer
from
jp
great
beer
jolly
pumpkin
makes
exquisite
creative
and
wholly
unique
beers
drinkability
is
quite
high
on
this
as
with
most
offerings
from
jp
plenty
of
interesting
aroma
flavor
and
smooth
going
down
lighter
medium
body
spritzy
on
the
tongue
pretty
dry
throughout
drinks
nicely
the
cherries
are
a
nice
touch
and
the
alcohol
is
invisible
once
again
not
my
favorite
jp
offering
but
another
tasty
one
for
sure
pours
a
lightly
hazed
burnt
sienna
color
with
moderate
cap
of
bubbles
gone
quickly
scent
is
bolder
than
many
beers
from
jolly
notes
of
carmel
malt
nuts
bitter
cocoa
and
bread
mingling
with
the
tart
and
funky
notes
taste
follows
scent
and
likewise
is
fairly
bold
for
jolly
there
is
a
nice
underlying
beer
below
the
funk
and
tart
and
those
qualities
actually
take
a
back
seat
when
they
usually
star
in
their
beers
medium
bodied
again
a
nice
moderate
level
of
carbonation
not
found
in
their
bottles
a
nice
beer
which
seems
to
do
a
couple
things
outside
of
the
normal
jolly
pumpkin
range
drink
is
good
not
much
abv
and
the
tartness
is
balanced
well
with
light
sweetness
and
bready
malts
and
light
funk
the
lacto
and
flemmy
take
away
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
good
with
just
enough
carbonation
finish
is
perfect
fairly
dry
with
just
enough
sweetness
flavor
stays
on
the
palate
making
it
real
easy
to
enjoy
this
one
for
a
while
my
first
review
and
my
first
try
of
a
jolly
pumpkin
offering
ill
review
this
beer
for
what
it
was
not
what
jp
claims
it
to
be
its
definitely
not
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
the
funk
and
tartness
make
it
an
american
wild
and
in
that
context
it
was
wonderful
having
looked
thru
the
jp
website
after
trying
this
beer
at
the
peekskill
brewery
a
thumbs
up
for
that
place
my
impression
is
that
jp
is
really
pushing
the
envelope
they
appear
to
be
true
nonconformists
and
are
exploring
some
really
extensive
boundaries
with
their
brewings
ill
be
trying
many
more
of
their
beers
and
recommend
the
maracaibo
without
reservation
this
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
bought
this
beer
i
was
expecting
to
taste
more
cacao
and
spices
and
brown
ale
qualities
at
the
very
minimum
after
a
glass
i
cant
seem
to
find
any
of
that
only
sour
apples
its
funky
too
funky
and
nowhere
on
the
bottle
does
it
say
anything
about
being
a
saison
or
farmhouse
ale
its
supposed
to
be
a
brown
ale
with
cacao
and
spices
inspired
by
the
monastic
brews
of
belgium
instead
its
a
bombastic
brew
for
a
brown
ale
its
sour
im
not
getting
any
cacao
nor
any
spices
its
sourness
is
overwhelming
to
me
i
dont
like
saisons
or
farmhouse
styles
so
this
is
especially
disgusting
to
me
12
00
for
the
bomber
and
only
one
glass
the
rest
goes
down
the
drain
no
more
jolly
pumpkin
for
me
overall
i
had
been
anticipating
this
beer
for
some
time
but
i
was
let
down
a
bit
the
flavors
are
interesting
and
meld
together
well
however
nothing
was
robust
enough
to
make
me
want
to
try
this
again
worth
a
shot
if
you
enjoy
jp
in
general
d
this
beer
is
quite
delicious
and
funky
with
some
nice
belgian
yeast
notes
that
make
the
beer
refreshing
and
drinkable
update
on
my
very
last
sip
when
the
beer
was
warmer
i
did
get
some
cocoa
notes
overall
a
fun
beer
very
different
not
sure
id
seek
this
out
again
seems
like
more
acidity
would
do
this
beer
well
very
satisfying
and
very
noteworthy
this
is
another
very
good
reason
why
jolly
pumpkin
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
state
drinks
jolly
pumpkin
does
this
to
me
all
the
time
i
want
to
like
their
beers
more
than
i
do
i
just
need
more
more
flavor
more
tartness
more
something
maracaibo
is
a
nice
wellbalanced
brown
its
just
a
little
subtle
for
my
palate
it
did
pair
nicely
however
with
some
balsamicdoused
salad
the
astringent
character
of
the
vinegar
brought
out
flavors
in
the
beer
i
hadnt
noticed
before
d
this
has
alot
working
for
it
this
killer
head
creamy
mouthfeel
and
the
nice
tartness
coupled
with
your
typical
strong
dark
ale
flavors
hard
to
believe
this
is
7
5
as
it
drinks
much
lower
a
really
tasty
brew
from
jolly
pumpkin
md
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
slightly
high
but
feels
right
drinkability
is
good
crisp
body
helps
this
overall
another
solid
beer
from
jp
d
a
pretty
good
dark
ale
i
wasnt
expecting
the
taste
to
be
quite
as
sour
but
it
was
still
enjoyable
would
try
again
d
good
not
great
for
me
maybe
with
some
time
and
a
building
brett
character
might
be
better
for
my
palatte
poured
with
a
smallish
light
tan
head
that
quickly
subsides
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
orange
medium
amber
aroma
has
just
bare
hints
of
the
ingredients
in
the
description
and
some
malt
and
a
little
earth
flavor
is
big
on
the
tartness
that
is
jps
trademark
and
kind
of
trumps
the
other
qualities
that
are
similar
to
the
nose
body
is
dominated
by
the
carbonation
and
i
think
could
have
maybe
used
a
little
more
density
finish
is
like
flavor
another
good
appertif
one
and
done
if
you
can
share
the
big
bottle
or
maybe
cook
with
the
leftover
its
not
really
a
belgian
strong
dark
it
may
have
been
before
going
wild
but
that
bridge
was
burnt
so
ill
not
review
it
as
a
bsd
because
it
would
do
poorly
as
a
wild
its
refreshing
this
is
a
very
distinct
and
unusual
flavor
not
at
all
what
i
would
have
expected
from
the
description
on
the
bottle
it
isnt
bad
but
it
is
a
bit
odd
like
a
belgian
strong
dark
blended
with
a
sour
red
with
a
bit
of
spices
added
in
a
nice
ale
to
try
but
the
flavor
is
just
a
bit
odd
for
me
even
though
i
like
those
flavors
individually
bottle
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
foam
glad
this
one
did
gush
everywhere
the
taste
has
a
sour
spiceyness
upfront
but
its
not
overwhelming
at
all
dark
fruits
like
orange
and
green
apples
linger
through
out
this
goes
down
quite
smooth
and
the
second
glass
is
drinking
even
better
pretty
solid
beer
overall
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
d
it
may
take
me
a
while
to
get
used
to
this
but
i
can
see
how
you
can
easily
acquire
a
taste
for
these
type
beers
it
certainly
makes
me
want
to
get
another
jolly
pumpkin
for
comparison
but
at
this
stage
this
will
be
a
slow
sipping
beer
for
me
and
i
may
have
trouble
getting
through
the
entire
bomber
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
like
a
slightly
sour
brown
beer
nicely
balanced
in
that
i
cant
actually
identify
any
of
the
extra
ingredients
but
can
tell
this
is
a
different
beer
i
can
taste
some
brett
l
and
lactic
flavors
that
make
this
very
interesting
to
drink
id
like
to
see
more
of
this
on
american
shores
drinkability
not
too
shabby
and
another
great
offering
from
jp
nothing
is
going
wrong
with
this
beer
and
the
sourfunkiness
from
the
brett
is
actually
fairly
mild
in
this
offering
so
its
pretty
good
for
someone
who
doesnt
have
tons
of
experience
in
this
area
of
beer
d
this
is
one
of
the
most
delicious
brews
end
of
story
d
goes
down
easy
nicely
balanced
funk
and
sour
are
present
but
not
overwhelming
i
could
enjoy
a
few
glasses
of
this
beer
drank
by
itself
but
probably
better
with
food
thanks
eric
for
bringing
this
one
over
pretty
nice
beer
from
jp
would
gladly
drink
this
one
again
and
am
interested
to
see
how
a
fresher
version
might
integrate
the
spicing
in
a
little
more
fairly
light
and
refreshing
yet
complex
thanks
eric
i
enjoyed
this
beer
so
much
that
i
got
a
bottle
togo
for
later
bartender
informed
me
that
she
preferred
the
bottle
vs
the
tap
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
yet
i
bow
to
you
mr
jeffries
mouth
is
a
touch
light
but
good
refreshing
drinkable
beer
a
bit
puckerish
and
i
need
it
to
be
paired
with
some
food
d
im
a
total
sucker
for
brews
like
this
i
could
drink
this
all
night
so
rich
and
dynamic
to
quaff
and
drink
by
itself
and
so
many
possibilities
for
food
pairings
id
drink
this
with
charcuterie
a
slightly
sour
semifirm
cows
milk
cheese
or
with
a
whole
roasted
chicken
this
beer
is
yet
another
reason
why
i
love
jolly
pumpkin
the
nose
on
this
beer
was
interesting
with
all
the
promise
of
a
good
sour
beer
the
clarity
and
mouthfeel
were
nice
but
when
it
came
time
to
drink
it
the
bitterness
was
overwhelming
with
little
malt
to
balance
it
out
making
the
beer
almost
undrinkable
i
like
most
sour
beers
but
in
this
case
it
seemed
like
the
beer
was
overly
bitter
and
then
the
bugs
ate
all
the
residual
sugars
leaving
the
beer
with
an
inhospitable
bite
in
the
taste
profile
as
i
essentially
state
in
all
my
jp
reviews
i
really
enjoy
these
beers
and
for
what
the
brewery
is
going
for
i
always
come
into
these
beers
with
an
open
mind
free
of
bias
so
i
can
enjoy
them
to
their
fullest
i
am
about
to
go
pair
this
with
some
cheese
and
crackers
which
im
sure
will
be
amazing
cheers
overall
a
nice
sour
the
spicing
is
overwhelmed
but
i
like
the
tart
sourness
and
the
brett
the
only
downside
is
the
watery
mouthfeel
d
another
interesting
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
certainly
not
my
favorite
but
id
definitely
give
it
another
try
and
id
like
to
see
how
it
might
develop
with
some
age
a
really
interesting
complex
beer
unlike
any
brown
ale
ive
had
before
lots
going
on
here
chocolate
orange
peel
cinnamon
an
overall
sour
flavor
the
cacao
lends
a
dry
bitter
finish
along
with
the
orange
peel
thoroughly
enjoyable
highest
recommendation
a
very
interesting
offering
wish
it
was
distributed
to
ma
id
been
holding
off
on
this
one
because
it
was
15
but
then
i
found
one
for
12
so
that
was
easier
to
stomach
this
was
clear
amber
and
didnt
have
much
of
a
head
at
all
despite
the
massive
foam
building
inside
the
bottle
maybe
my
glass
was
not
clean
enough
the
smell
was
quite
buggy
suggesting
sour
as
well
as
brett
funkiness
the
taste
was
very
strange
at
first
it
was
like
a
sour
cherries
but
then
there
would
be
flashes
of
what
i
recognize
as
a
brown
ale
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
the
cacao
but
no
other
discernible
spices
this
was
interesting
but
not
something
i
would
buy
a
second
time
i
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
find
it
easy
to
drink
with
a
pleasant
level
of
complexity
d
easy
drinking
and
very
interesting
makes
you
want
more
pour
this
baby
slow
coming
out
of
the
bottle
into
my
duvel
tulip
it
created
a
ton
of
head
nice
deep
brown
color
and
some
sticky
lacing
immediately
get
whiffs
of
brett
but
thats
not
really
surprising
coming
from
a
jolly
pumpkin
bottle
other
aromas
include
low
alpha
acid
hops
and
a
subtle
coffee
undertone
complex
variety
of
flavors
including
lemon
orange
rind
ginger
and
chocolate
the
flavors
hang
out
in
my
mouth
a
while
after
swallow
and
has
some
excellent
carbonation
the
more
sours
i
taste
especially
from
jp
and
russian
river
the
more
i
like
them
starting
to
be
a
devout
worshiper
at
the
alter
of
sour
smells
sour
more
than
this
beer
really
is
but
good
actually
really
good
wow
very
complex
coco
spice
funkyjammyfruityeast
very
effervescent
and
light
on
the
mouth
i
found
this
to
be
really
tasty
similar
to
their
beer
de
garde
only
replace
hop
with
bittersweet
chocolate
very
good
and
very
complex
a
must
try
product
i
got
mine
at
a
beer
bar
in
seal
beach
for
23
bucks
750ml
and
am
feeling
like
it
was
a
steal
taste
starts
off
with
a
mix
of
cherries
and
other
fruits
some
chocolate
in
the
middle
with
apples
finish
has
a
big
wood
presence
with
a
mild
but
luring
tartness
some
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
tart
fruity
and
dry
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
could
drink
the
whole
bottle
light
and
complex
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
not
too
strong
to
begin
with
smooth
for
a
jolly
pumpkin
brew
would
drink
again
worth
trying
d
like
the
other
brews
from
jolly
pumpkin
has
that
funk
barrel
taste
that
i
love
worth
trying
sometime
really
amazing
really
something
not
american
tasted
like
a
surly
bird
by
de
proef
that
is
if
you
can
find
a
good
bottle
good
luck
drinkabilitys
soso
but
it
is
a
sourfunky
beer
so
thats
to
be
expected
the
mouthfeel
does
a
lot
to
make
it
drinkable
even
though
its
a
palatechallenger
in
some
ways
d
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
have
come
to
expect
from
jolly
pumpkin
a
very
flavorable
and
unique
beer
that
was
great
to
try
something
that
you
cannot
drink
sessionably
but
once
in
a
while
drinkability
incredibly
drinkable
for
its
complexity
no
perceptible
alcohol
again
and
id
even
say
that
perhaps
this
is
not
that
compelling
in
comparison
to
some
of
their
other
beers
that
are
more
fullthrottle
but
this
one
is
certainly
more
balanced
in
some
way
on
that
note
the
beer
is
neither
cheap
nor
easy
to
find
so
if
you
dont
like
wild
funky
ales
then
simply
dont
commit
yourself
to
a
whole
bottle
i
hesitate
to
say
dont
bother
because
i
really
consider
the
work
of
ron
jeffries
among
my
favourite
of
americas
artisan
brewers
jolly
pumpkin
is
an
experience
for
everyone
to
have
at
least
a
little
at
least
once
this
is
my
second
spin
with
this
beer
it
had
a
greater
impact
on
me
the
first
time
around
at
a
ba
tasting
of
dozens
of
excellent
beers
i
think
it
would
be
beneficial
for
reviewers
to
put
the
batch
number
and
the
year
if
possible
for
this
beer
as
it
is
aged
longer
than
most
of
their
other
beers
d
this
is
a
nice
sipper
overall
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
but
does
not
live
up
to
the
high
standard
ive
come
to
expect
from
jolly
pumpkin
beers
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
breweries
lineup
its
definitely
worth
a
try
though
an
interesting
sipper
here
a
spiced
brew
that
goes
towards
oud
bruin
with
less
maltiness
different
a
fine
sour
and
spicy
sipper
that
doesnt
fit
into
a
particular
style
per
se
not
as
rich
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
but
certainly
worth
having
as
a
something
different
brew
overall
an
interestingly
complex
sour
ale
that
is
relatively
accessible
i
would
have
preferred
some
more
malt
character
overall
another
great
offering
by
jolly
pumpkin
while
the
combination
of
brown
ale
and
various
other
ingredients
was
interesting
it
did
lack
a
complexity
that
i
have
seen
in
other
great
beers
of
this
style
still
a
solid
brew
i
love
jp
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
highly
recommended
d
another
nice
beer
from
jp
as
with
all
of
their
products
it
is
hard
to
attach
a
style
to
this
beer
but
it
is
complex
and
refreshingly
sour
somewhere
between
a
flemmish
red
and
a
acidic
fantomestyle
saison
which
is
a
combination
that
suits
my
taste
quite
well
this
beer
is
complex
in
its
simplicity
light
brown
with
a
medium
manageable
head
the
woody
chocolate
flavor
takes
center
stage
the
signature
jolly
pumpkin
funk
takes
a
background
note
this
jolly
pumpkin
taste
is
a
bit
sour
with
some
alcohol
in
this
beer
the
basic
cocao
flavor
is
very
hard
to
place
but
it
reminds
me
of
a
piney
as
in
pine
tree
flavor
dominated
by
chocolate
pours
a
cloudy
chocolate
brown
color
with
tan
head
sour
aroma
that
consists
of
chocolate
maltiness
oak
dark
fruit
and
citrus
flavor
very
similar
with
lots
of
oak
vanilla
chocolate
malts
candi
sugar
dark
fruit
and
orange
peel
very
tasty
drinkability
this
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
very
well
crafted
not
over
the
top
it
has
just
enough
sour
funkiness
to
make
me
want
to
keep
sipping
but
it
is
so
damn
good
that
i
dont
want
to
finish
it
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
whole
orangechocolate
things
in
general
but
jolly
pumpkin
really
makes
it
work
with
this
brew
good
stuff
bottle
labeled
as
batch
254
an
hour
into
this
beer
and
theres
still
that
zombie
foam
on
top
unreal
this
is
weird
stuff
and
you
should
try
it
side
note
this
seems
like
more
of
an
american
wild
ale
or
a
farmhouse
ale
to
me
than
a
bsda
no
matter
the
more
i
drink
of
it
the
more
i
like
it
just
one
of
those
beers
it
might
take
a
glass
and
a
half
under
your
belt
to
begin
to
really
get
it
overall
a
a
nice
beer
probably
not
my
favorite
belgian
strong
dark
but
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
drinkability
id
pass
on
this
if
offered
again
wasnt
really
bad
but
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
didnt
really
impress
me
hoping
for
more
chocolate
and
spice
would
have
again
for
sure
if
offered
but
whouldnt
shell
out
the
12
for
another
bottle
d
a
true
and
rich
delight
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
and
served
in
a
tulip
this
beer
poured
a
murky
brown
with
a
sustained
head
of
fluffy
tan
foam
solid
lace
encompassed
the
entire
glass
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
made
up
of
caramel
mild
citrus
cinnamon
and
also
an
oaky
vinous
note
the
flavor
included
lightly
sour
cherries
orange
spicy
yeast
and
an
almost
hidden
trace
of
roasted
malt
mildly
funky
but
the
taste
seems
to
be
muted
by
this
aspect
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
light
carbonation
this
beer
definately
has
the
house
characteristics
youd
expect
from
a
jp
beer
but
not
much
else
still
fairly
enjoyable
though
i
could
tell
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
that
i
was
in
for
something
special
there
is
a
wonderful
nose
on
this
beer
plenty
of
spice
tartness
and
funk
the
taste
is
incredible
the
taste
has
a
nice
dose
of
cacao
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
and
just
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
real
treat

taste

sour
notes
with
loads
of

and
barnyardlike

minimum
filtration
with
great
carbonation
and
no

i
really
enjoyed
again
the
wild
taste
of
the
jp
beers
but
cannot
say
that
i
detected
much
cinnamon
or
cacao
overall
it
is
a
very
pleasant
easy
to
drink
beer
a
disaster
on
many
levels
notes
excellent
stuff
one
of
the
better
jp
offerings
ive
tried
overall
its
very
clean
and
crisp
with
a
light
feel
despite
the
somewhat
medium
body
carbonation
adds
some
brightness
swallows
very
clean
drinks
well
overall
with
a
nice
somewhat
unique
taste
lacking
depth
for
the
style
with
the
tea
flavor
become
somewhat
taxing
not
a
favorite
of
mine
d
sharing
a
bottle
between
three
was
perfect
in
a
bottle
purchased
while
dining
at
stone
batch
253
poured
a
fairly
clear
medium
brownish
red
generous
airy
head
smell
was
mildly
to
moderately
sour
but
a
bit
sweet
the
taste
was
tart
with
the
standard
jolly
pumpkin
woody
barrel
taste
its
like
a
wet
toasty
wood
is
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
a
lightmedium
body
on
this
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
cinnamon
or
orange
peel
but
perhaps
some
slight
chocolate
character
very
good
my
favorite
jp
beer
so
far
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
golden
amber
color
very
nice
carbonation
very
nice
onefinger
plus
creamy
tannish
head
lots
of
nice
creamy
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
tangy
bourbon
slight

plums
figs

and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
pretty
tangy
some
bourbon
going
on
in
there
some
spices
dark
fruit
and
caramel
the
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
an
awesome
brew
highly
recommende
slight
twist
on
a
bsda
ps
this
bottle
was
from
batch
254
overall
this
takes
the
cake
for
me
in
terms
of
jolly
pumpkin
beers
bam
biere
is
probably
the
best
daytoday
drinker
but
this
is
1
for
overall
awesomeness
poured
from
bottle
at
pp
bottle
shop
into
small
pilsner
glass
poured
a
chestnut
brown
color
with
foaming
off
white
head
smell
is
sour
funk
mixed
with
hint
of
spice
and
cacao
taste
is

sour
with
a
nice
tartness
on
the
front
followed
by
cinnamon
and
cacao
on
the
finish
carbonation
is
ample
with
a
medium
body
mouthfeel
i
like
this
beer
very
much
and
think
is
a
great
drinking
belgium
brown
with
a
few
twist
and
turns
d
amazingly
smooth
beer
unfortunately
the
flavor
falls
short
of
the
fragrant
aromas
this
is
an
intriguing
seasonal
from
jp
that
has
a
lot
of
promise
but
doesnt
quite
deliver
cheers
d
another
delicious
brew
from
jp
they
really
cant
do
any
wrong
get
some
this
may
only
be
my
second
jolly
pumpkin
experience
but
god
damn
they
make
some
fantastic
beers
amazingly
unique
a
style
all
their
own
these
beers
greatly
remind
me
of
good
funky
wines
these
are
perfect
to
serve
to
any
wine
aficionados
you
may
know
drinkability
is
good
but
the
sourness
is
intense
wow
what
an
original
brew
very
odd
ive
never
had
anything
like
it
before
to
be
honest
im
still
not
sure
if
i
even
liked
it
or
not
i
need
to
try
this
one
again
to
wrap
my
head
around
it
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
creamy
texture
without
any
sweetness
hops
are
basically
non
existent
there
is
the
presence
of
sour
fruit
possibly
cherry
its
very
dry
with
an
intense
cinammonnutmeg
sharpness
and
quite
spicy
it
seems
there
is
a
balance
between
the
sour
fruit
and
the
intense
spice
but
no
hop
presence
or
bitterness
that
i
missed
still
this
is
a
beer
to
savour
the
delicate
interplay
between
the
sour
and
the
spice
with
a
tart
finish
is
very
enticing
and
a
taste
experience
very
dry
too
the
alcohol
gives
it
a
bit
of
a
liquerlike
aftertaste
warmth
in
the
mouth
while
preserving
an
overall
positive
drinkability
what
a
nicely
crafted
beer
thanks
to
biegaman
for
suggesting
i
pick
up
a
few
jolly
pumpkins
and
this
one
in
particular
drinkability
is
exceedingly
high
for
any
beer
sour
ale
brown
ale
whatever
very
complex
but
rounded
and
understated
i
can
easy
drink
a
few
of
these
a
perfect
thanksgiving
beer
jolly
pumpkin
maracaibo
especial
pours
a
clear
brow
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
the
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
and
dark
fruits
with
a
nice
tart
undertone
the
flavor
is
at
first
sweet
but
then
very
tart
almost
sour
with
tons
of
fruity
flavor
orange
cacao
and
others
the
finish
is
tart
and
more
astrigent
than
bitter
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
cocoa
and
tart
fruit
in
the
taste
sour
upfront
with
cocoa
undertones
and
a
nice
alcohol
presence
a
sour
fruit
mouthfeel
with
a
sour
alcohol
aftertaste
the
coca
was
nice
mix
with
sourness
the
alcohol
held
it
together
is
jolly
pumpkin
the
fantome
of
the
usa
i
think
so
ultimately
i
was
unable
to
finish
a
glass
of
this
beer
there
are
too
many
other
great
beers
in
the
world
to
try
to
choke
down
this
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
an
adequate
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
minimal
show
before
heading
for
the
door
not
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
nice
the
brett
character
reminds
me
of
a
flanders
red
the
taste
is
interestingly
unique
theres
a
slight
sourness
accompanied
by
hints
of
cacao
and
hop
bitterness
background
sweets
accompanied
by
a
light
orange
flavor
and
a
touch
of
clove
or
maybe
cinnamon
nice
carbonation
and
overall
mouthfeel
this
is
a
subtle
brew
and
if
there
was
one
knock
it
would
be
that
the
taste
is
kinda
hollow
like
theres
something
missing
i
guess
im
looking
to
be
smacked
in
the
face
with
cacao
or
something
but
all
i
get
is
restrained
balance
but
you
can
make
a
case
that
it
was
intended
that
way
and
id
bet
that
it
was
very
drinkable
another
awesome
beer
from
jp

kind
of

my
closest
friends
and
i
lovereal
crazy
wild

belgian
flavor
maracaibo
especial
and
the
rest
of
the
jolly
pumpkin
lineup
strikes
me
as
no
compromises
kind
of
beer
it
seems
as
though
the
brewer
has
a
particular
vision
that
he
doesnt
care
to
deviate
from
hey
ron
would
it
kill
you
to
ease
off
the
funk
and
to
allow
some
of
the
malt
sugars
to
make
it
to
the
end
product
in
the
glass
the
beer
is
clouded
redbrown
only
a
scant
13
inch
of
head
but
whats
there
is
an
impenetrably
dense
cream
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
tulip
smells
like
a
flemish
sour
ale
laced
with
oranges
black
pepper
a
bit
of
powdered
cocoa
and
dusty
yeast
notes
the
ale
is
fairly
sour
in
on
the
tongue
with
nice
orange
lemon
and
pepper
notes
that
build
to
a
rather
dry
earthy
and
powdered
yeast
plus
cacao
finish
dont
expect
much
chocolate
flavor
as
the
spicing
tends
much
more
towards
orange
and
lemon
except
in
the
aftertaste
body
is
mediumrich
with
plenty
of
carbonation
quite
drinkable
as
an
afterdinner
treat
lovers
of
sour
flemish
ales
will
find
this
enjoyable
pours
a
translucent
ruddy
glowing
brown
with
a
nice
thick
sustaining
head
rich
aromas
of
a
classic
belgian
sour
ale
the
taste
is
complex
and
contradictory
earthy
but
not
malty
with
bitter
cinnamon
notes
and
fruity
qualities
that
are
at
once
sour
tart
and
dry
i
cant
really
detect
the
cacao
and
i
might
not
have
noticed
the
hint
of
orange
peel
if
the
label
hadnt
mentioned
it
but
theres
still
a
lot
going
on
here
it

alcohol
is

at

the
only
issue
is
how
much

can
you
take
a

poured
into
a

a

that

its

abv
pours
a
dark
redish
brown
with
a
good
head
and
good

the
smell
is
lemon
spice
and
some
dark
malt
aromas
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
delicious
moderate
sourness
up
frontfollowed
by
a
spicy
creaminess
and
fairly
deep
cocoa
finish
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
refreshing
but
with
a
nice
creaminess
as
well
very
nice
beer
as
are
somany
of
the
jolly
pumpkin
brews
d
more
of
a
dessert
or
sipping
beer
due
to
the
intense
sweetness
hard
to
pair
with
a
meal
because
of
this
reason
if
you
can
handle
the
belgian
spices
and
sweetness
this
makes
a
nice
beer
to
share
and
enjoy
drinkability
this
is
one
id
get
for
a
beer
tasting
with
some
seasoned
palates
the
sourness
would
be
too
much
to
push
on
the
macro
crowd
but
for
those
who
have
entered
into
the
craft
scene
it
would
get
a
better
reception
it
is
a
well
made
beer
it
has
good
small
bubbles
a
decent
medium
body
and
as
a
sour
brown
it
makes
sense
i
dont
like
sour
brown
call
it
sour
and
i
have
no
problem
its
true
to
style
but
who
knew
true
an
excellent
beer
i
wish
my
scoring
in
the
drinkability
category
was
higher
unfortunately
i
cannot
see
drinking
more
than
a
snifter
of
this
because
of
the
bitter
spice
finish
drinkability
it
cost
a
little
more
than
the
usual
jolly
pumpkin
offerings
but
i
really
dont
care
ill
pay
a
little
more
for
this
one
is
it
a
brown
ale
like
the
label
stated
no
but
i
honestly
dont
care
what
they
call
it
i
dont
care
if
it
was
labeled
a
special
pale
ale
it
would
still
be
good
either
way
if
you
like
sour
beers
like
i
do
yet
is
also
like
a
belgian
dark
ale
in
the
chocolate
notes
whoever
said
this
brewery
was
good
was
not
lying
i
want
to
try
all
of
their

a

review
for
chai
brown
not
currently
on
ba
but
want
to
track
all
my
beers
in
2015
saranac
was
one
of
my
first
craft
beers
over
20
years
ago
surprisingly
liked
the
chai
brown
more
of
a
holiday
beer
nice
dark
brown
flavor
and
strong
spiced
aroma
good
spice
vs
brown
malt
combo
neither
overwhelms
the
other
taste
settles
evenly
and
lingers
in
the
mouth
well
worth
a
try
this
was
a
goodstandard
consumer
beer
the
feel
is
good
though
id
prefer
a
stronger
medium
body
to
this
lighter
one
it
is
crisp
without
being
too
crisp
with
a
little
smoothness
o
this
was
my
last
bottle
in
the
trail
mix
6pack
that
i
purchased
like
the
others
this
was
an
easy
drinking
and
solid
tasting
brew
but
it
didnt
show
me
anything
to
set
itself
apart
from
other
offerings
within
the
style
overall
i
didnt
mind
having
this
beer
but
will
look
to
other
brown
ales
when
i
have
a
thirst
for
this
style
of
beer
o
im
just
going
to
assume
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
bottle
i
recently
drank
still
the
flavor
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
wouldnt
turn
this
beer
down
if
it
were
offered
to
me
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
either
overall
considering
how
nice
this
beer
smells
the
taste
is
disappointing
yet
tollerable
not
worth
revisiting
this
was
a
pleasant
brown
ale
i
would
actually
put
this
a
step
above
sierra
nevadas
tumbler
autumn
brown
i
didnt
have
any
artificial
smokiness
or
sugary
notes
this
is
everything
i
would
expect
in
an
american
brown
mahogany
in
color
the
head
at
first
is
about
half
a
finger
but
thick
and
creamy
it
quickly
disappears
and
becomes
nothing
but
a
small
lace
around
the
rim
nose
has
a
nutty
fruit
aroma
with
a
large
caramel
malt
background
flavor
is
similar
at
first
there
is
the
caramel
and
toasty
malt
but
it
instantly
changes
to
a
smooth
caramel
sweetness
with
a
candied
fruit
sweetness
for
the
finish
the
sweetness
cloys
on
the
finish
after
a
couple
of
sips
which
leaves
a
scratchy
feeling
at
the
back
of
my
throat
i
get
this
feeling
with
overly
flavored
fruit
beers
and
saisons
im
all
set
after
half
of
one
of
these
a
nice
brown
ale
it
could
be
a
little
more
fullbodied
and
offer
a
more
intense
flavor
profile
but
still
very
enjoyable
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
deep
amberbrown
color
slightly
hazed
with
a
very
thin
layer
of
biege
head
aromas
of
maple
and
nut
sweetness
blending
well
together
and
refraining
from
being
overpowering
a
nice
sweet
smooth
nose
that
is
light
and
welcoming
flavors
are
nutty
initially
with
a
roasted
character
and
the
beer
opens
up
over
the
middle
of
the
tongue
to
reveal
a
tart
and
sweet
dark
fruit
note
as
well
as
some
earthy
flavors
blending
into
the
tangy
caramel
malty
backbone
the
body
is
a
little
lighter
than
i
prefer
for
the
style
with
no
signs
of
lacing
and
an
almost
watery
feeling
in
mouth
at
times
interesting
blend
of
flavors
which
transition
into
a
tangy
and
sharp
aftertaste
that
coats
the
mouth
and
jabs
the
tip
of
the
tongue
the
finish
is
a
little
on
the
cloying
side
but
not
overly
so
despite
all
the
sweet
characteristics
throughout
decent
brew
onot
the
best
brown
ale
ive
had
but
mos
def
one
of
the
better
ones
o
a
pretty
solid
brown
ale
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
beer
is
mahogany
colored
with
an
inch
of
tan
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
pretty
weak
with
some
toasted
bread
malt
caramel
and
nuts
the
flavor
is
ok
with
a
light
roast
presence
the
hop
character
is
amped
up
a
bit
more
than
expected
the
body
is
thin
with
ample
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
but
nothing
special
or
exciting
happening
here
beer
is
thinner
than
expected
and
hoppier
than
expected
it
is
light
in
body
with
a
mild
sweetness
almost
nothing
on
the
midpalate
and
a
really
bitter
finish
from
hops
not
grain
there
is
a
mild
roast
to
the
whole
thing
not
very
interesting
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
d
extremely
well
balanced
tasting
blind
i
could
probably
pegged
this
as
a
saranac
immediately
if
you
love
the
brand
as
i
do
this
is
certainly
one
to
try
if
not
keep
walking
o
an
interesting
beer
its
hard
to
truly
dislike
this
beer
as
much
as
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
mellow
wont
offend
anyone
i
have
had
much
better
browns
i
would
even
rate
the
taste
of
this
particular
beer
a
bit
bellow
average
in
terms
of
all
elements
though
it
is
rather
middle
of
the
road
i
probably
will
not
purchase
it
again
drinkability
part
of
a
mixed
6
i
purchased
in
iowa
not
available
locally
and
honestly
there
are
so
many
brown
ales
available
that
are
better
i
do
not
think
i
would
go
out
of
y
way
to
have
this
again
a
nice
average
brown
ale
nothing
crazy
but
it
was
solid
big
thanks
to
alex
for
pulling
through
on
the
bulk
of
these
o
this
beer
has
an
off
flavor
that
doesnt
appeal
to
me
half
of
it
i
like
and
half
i
dont
unfortunately
i
could
not
finish
this
one
a
standard
but
wellmade
brown
ale
the
smoky
roasted
character
would
go
well
with
summer
bbq
d
very
drinkable
fairly
crisp
and
smooth
however
it
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
and
fullness
the
flavors
feel
a
touch
off
overall
but
still
enjoyable
out
of
a
saranac
sampler
into
my
perfect
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
chestnut
brown
with
a
billowing
cream
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
lots
of
lace
behind
that
great
appearance
is
not
much
the
beer
smells
somewhat
toasty
and
a
little
chocolaty
the
taste
says
mild
to
me
even
though
the
abv
is
too
high
for
one
burnt
toast
bittersweet
toffee
and
a
slight
astringency
are
all
im
really
getting
out
of
this
balance
is
good
but
theres
no
discernible
hop
flavor
finishes
dry
with
lingering
burnt
toast
flavors
in
the
mouth
the
body
is
medium
and
dry
with
about
the
right
tingle
overall
im
not
loving
this
but
its
ok
d
could
drink
a
few
of
these
if
they
were
best
choice
on
the
menu
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
light
and
has
a
nice
drinkable
feel
there
is
a

overall
a

and
creamy
brown
ale
with
a
nice

a

and
yeasty

with

this

tastes
like

soft
smooth
feel
is
enhanced
by
gentle
carbonation
and
a
proper
bit
of
weight
but
not

heavy
quite
drinkable
and
a
delicious
fall
and
winter
session
ale
even
at
six
percent
taste
is
light
a
bit
of
iron
and
kind
of
a
dry
but
slightly
bitter
finish
theres
some
chewy
darker
malts
and
its
pretty
dry
its
a
brown
ale
so
there
isnt
too
much
exciting
about
it
but
it
does
a
good
job
at
it
overall
i
liked
it
was
more
a
winter
brew
for
me
and
on
a
66
degree
february
day
that
is
an
oxymoron
if
this
beer
was
just
a
little
fullbodied
i
think
it
would
be
one
of
the
best
brown
ales
around
nevertheless
i
still
think
this
is
a
decent
brown
ale
worth
a
try
easy
enough
to
drink
not
bad
for
a
brown
ale
d
thoroughly
average
its
good
enough
that
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
these
and
its
unremarkable
enough
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
sixer
of
these
an
entirely
drinkable
beer
i
would
take
this
over
a
lot
of
saranac
products
and
plenty
of
nonsaranac
products
d
for
fans
of
american
browns
this
is
a
surprisingly
and
hoppy
drinkable
ale
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
surprisingly
bright
aroma
the
malts
here
were
highly
robust
and
gave
off
a
nice
dark
caramely
scent
this
translated
relatively
well
into
the
taste
with
an
unexpected
hop
dominance
throughout
a
good
portion
of
the
session
pours
brown
with
a
small
foamy
head
aroma
of
toasted
malts
and
citrus
hops
medium
to
full
body
quite
crisp
hops
slightly
dominate
flavor
over
malt
finish
is
long
dry
coffeeish
almost
stout
like
i
think
one
of
the
better
saranac
brews
although
not
on
par
with
the
best
examples
of
the
style
music
pairing
the
decemberists
down
by
the
water
cut
copy
where
im
going
this
beer
somehow
misses
it
looks
and
smells
good
but
the
taste
falls
short
drinkability
nothing
spectacular
but
has
everything
one
would
expect
in
the
style
d
easy
to
quaff
but
not
an
exceptional
take
on
the
style
its
consistently
a
bit
above
average
from
the
pour
to
the
aroma
to
the
body
drinks
easy
but
there
are
way
better
brown
ales
out
there
i
support
it
because
its
local
but
i
couldnt
recommend
this
ill
avoid
this
in
the
future
pretty
good
beerand
i
dont
even
like
most
brown
alesbut
this
one
is
all
rightthe
color
is
a
very
dark
brown
beerit
smells
like
a
decent
malty
smelltaste
very
malty
almost
no
hop
presence
if
any
i
would
say
kent
goldings
almost
drythe
mouthfeel
is
almost
very
richamostvery
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
a
4
pack
of
themall
in
all
pretty
good
beerbetter
than
their
others
drinkability
a
very
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
brown
ale
which
surprisingly
has
a
nice
hop
profile
and
isnt
all
malts
worth
a
look
for
sure
and
this
is
a
brown
ale
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
again
d
quite
drinkable
not
a
bad
brown
ale
my
favorite
part
is
in
the
aftertaste
as
i
feel
its
more
slanted
towards
hops
than
most
in
this
style
drink
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
its
nothing
spectacular
but
it
is
really
highly
drinkable
id
probably
seek
it
out
again
d
more
complexity
would
increase
the
appeal
for
me
not
the
best
beer
but
surely
another
solid
saranac
offering
overall
this
was
kind
of
a
disappointing
brown
its
been
awhile
since
i
had
a
brown
ale
and
this
probably
wasnt
the
best
choice
going
back
to
the
style
i
wouldnt
drink
unless
its
your
only
option
i
wouldnt
go
for
too
many
of
these
d
yawn
thats
about
all
i
can
say
soso
nothing
bad
but
nothing
special
tastes
like
other
brown
ales
ive
had
easy
enough
to
drink
not
going
to
win
any
awards
though
this
beer
has
a
dark
brown
almost
black
colour
and
a
great
head
that
really
lasts
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
non
descript
this
beer
tastes
harsh
and
hoppy
when
it
first
hits
your
mouth
there
are
some
coffee
flavours
that
sometimes
shine
through
before
an
aftertaste
that
is
slightly
bitter
it
has
a
quite
light
body
just
a
brown
ale
drinkable
refreshing
tasty
and
smooth
could
drink
these
all
night
long
id
love
some
steak
and
mash
potatoes
now
d
decent
ale
another
good
offering
from
saranac
drinkability
simple
smooth
and
drinkable
no
off
flavors
or
aromas
in
this
beer
but
at
the
same
time
nothing
mind
blowing
a
solid
brown
ale
and
one
i
would
never
turn
down
d
this
ale
seemed
to
go
flat
very
quickly
this
made
finishing
it
a
chore
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
not

brown
ale
poured
into

beige

good
retention
with
a
nice

effect
along
the

sweet
malty
caramel
aroma
with
hints
of
clove
slightly
bitter
and
spicy
almost
ciderlike
in
taste
and
consistency
highly
carbonated
which
i
like
medium
body
goes
down
easy
and
packs
a
nice
buzz
kind
of
a
mild
licorice
aftertaste
but
not
bad
one
of
the
better
brews
in
the
trail
mix
sampler
though
i
am
more
partial
to
the
darker
beers
so
its
kind
of
difficult
to
be
objective
m
creamy
and
silky
smooth
overall
moderate
and
it
is
nice
tight
bubbles
it
quenches
the
thirst
but
it
is
not
wet
nor
dry
a
balance
has
been
met
m
quite
creamy
carbonation
is
way
too
high
its
very
sharp
d
its
easy
to
drink
this
beer
but
the
pedestrian
taste
doesnt
leave
me
longing
to
have
another
one
of
these
very
average
brown
to
me
might
do
in
a
pinch
but
not
one
id
reach
for
by
choice
not
a
bad
little
brown
ale
here
overall
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
beer
i
was
expecting
a
better
brown
ale
i
had
brooklyn
and
new
castle
and
both
were
much
better
than
this
one
i
think
the
taste
hurts
this
one
which
is
probably
why
i
wont
want
to
drink
another
d
a
pretty
decent
brown
ale
had
some
nice
sweet
chocolate
in
the
taste
and
would
try
again

medium

light
feel
with
a
moderately
high

overall
not

the
last
time
i
had
this
beer
i
distinctly
remember
picking
up
on
some
chocolate
notes
which
were
not
there
this
time
regardless
not
bad
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
d
a
little
heavier
than
i
was
expecting
overall
a
damn
good
brown
ale
ehhh
disappointing
bitter
and
sour
without
the
sweet
caramel
malts
which
usually
balance
out
a
quality
brown
ale
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
brown
with
about
a
finger
of
ecru
foamy
head
that
lingers
once
it
shrinks
down
a
bit
there
is
some
nice
sudsy
lacing
but
not
much
the
nose
is
very
weak
with
notes
of
maple
syrup
hops
and
a
tiny
bit
of
cocoa
the
taste
emphasizes
the
hops
bitterness
adding
some
bitter
chocolate
some
maple
syrup
and
a
kiss
of
honey
the
body
is
slightly
lightly
medium
with
some
strong
carbonation

very
fluid
feel
leading
to
a
pretty
high
drinkability

second
beer
that
i
am
reviewing
form
the
12
mix
pack
poured
into
a
tulip
style
glass
light
brown
color
large
white
head
that
lingered
for
a
while
has
a
hoppier
than
expected
smell
taste
was
not
as
hoppy
but
more
malty
with
notes
of
pumpernickel
bread
and
caramel
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
not
great
a
bit
thin
for
a
brown
ale
easily
drinkable
even
for
a
6
beer
not
the
best
brown
ale
ever
made
but
worth
a
try
the
moutfeel
was
light
and
liquidic
this
was
an
excellect
example
of
the
intended
style
very
good
stuff
d
it
is
ok
and
i
like
to
support
family
owned
business
however
i
have
to
admit
that
sammy
adams
is
a
better
offeringthat
is
to
say
that
there
isnt
too
much
that
is
too
special
about
this
one
grainy
and
pretty
hoppy
strong
grainy
notes
with
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
bitterish
touch
certainly
an
american
brown
wish
it
would
have
more
malty
richness
could
use
it
and
still
stay
in
american
interpretation
of
style
d
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
well
balanced
brown
ale
there
is
nothing
particularly
notable
about
this
beer
but
the
malt
and
hop
characteristics
are
pleasant
and
well
balanced
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
better
brews
from
saranac
this
is
for
the
most
part
a
good
beer
i
just
wouldnt
want
any
more
than
one
or
two
of
them
before
i
started
looking
for
something
else
to
drink
d
nothing
very
unique
or
exciting
about
this
brown
ale
but
a
generally
well
made
beer
a
nice
crisp
enjoyable
beer
which
is
light
for
a
brown
ale
and
medium
overall
in
the
taste
department
yet
its
one
that
i
will
indulge
again
again
not
the
most
exciting
beer
as
far
as
a
sensory
on
the
palate
but
the
drinkability
makes
up
for
it
makes
this
a
solid
brew
clear
dark
amber
with
a
whipped
foamy
head
of
cream
colored
foam
that
leaves
some
nice
lace
on
the
glass
roasted
grain
toffee
and
floral
hop
notes
the
flavors
mirror
the
nose
for
the
most
part
with
the
hop
flavor
slightly
more
pronounced
medium
light
bodied
with
prickly
carbonation
a
good
beer
from
saranac
well
i
was
generally
unimpressed
with
this
beer
i
really
like
brown
ales
i
would
spend
the
extra
money
any
day
and
go
for
a
dogfish
palo
santo
marron
six
pack
i
really
liked
this
crisp
lightmedium
bodied
brown
ale
more
than
i
thought
i
would
even
this
looks
smells
tastes
good
has
a
lilght
bitter
finish
but
overall
is
smooth
and
has
the
saranac
taste
that
i
find
the
others
from
this
company
have
ill
be
getting
this
again
at
some
poiint
i
could
certainly
drink
a
few
and
enjoy
maybe
its
just
the
picture
on
the
bottle
and
that
im
in
new
england
but
i
want
to
take
this
beer
out
on
a
hike
or
camping
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
makes
this
beer
go
down
smooth
and
easy
this
beer
has
a
nice
clear
brown
color
appropriate
to
the
style
the
head
is
a
tan
color
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
hops
and
slight
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
a
decent
balance
of
malty
sweetness
and
hoppy
bitterness
the
carbonation
and
texture
gives
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
nothing
was
outstanding
about
the
beer
but
its
a
decent
brown
ale
if
it
turns
up
at
a
party
or
on
draft
for
a
cheap
price
i
will
partake
but
otherwise
probably
not
d
goes
down
easily
its
just
not
what
i
usually
expect
for
a
brown
ale
even
an
american
brown
ale
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
saranac
doesnt
normally
knock
my
socks
off
but
most
of
the
things
ive
tried
are
solid
and
the
prices
are
great
the
sour
nut
thing
really
killed
it
for
me
drinkability
an
easy
to
drink
beer
very
enjoyable
i
want
another
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mostly
of
hops
some
malts
taste
is
very
hoppy
not
much
else
going
on
feels
light
and
bitter
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
but
not
great
selection
overallmore
subdued
than
some
others
but
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
not
bad
a
nice
choice
from
matt
brewing
cheers
d
overall
not
bad
but
also
not
a
good
beer
i
will
never
seek
it
out
but
im
glad
it
was
included
in
this
mixed
sixer
i
dont
know
what
to
say
about
drinkability
because
it
is
fairly
light
and
weak
for
style
but
i
guess
it
goes
down
ok
its
just
not
what
i
want
in
an
american
brown
slightly
dissapointed
d
i
feel
that
this
isnt
hardhitting
enough
to
be
a
good
brown
ale
i
prefer
mine
to
be
upfront
inyourface
dark
roasted
malts
and
alcohol
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
think
the
numbers
will
vary
a
lot
on
this
one
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
two
finger
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
mediumthick
lacing
on
my
glass
a
very
good
appearance
overall
smell
is
pretty
plainnot
much
going
on
initial
scent
reveals
straight
malts
with
some
nutty
hints
to
it
after
a
while
it
seems
like
the
initial
malts
fade
and
a
nuttymetallic
characteristic
takes
over
not
really
impressed
at
all
by
the
smell
also
i
get
no
hops
they
speak
of
on
the
bottle
in
the
aroma
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
seems
to
be
the
case
with
all
the
saranac
stuff
i
have
had
overall
hints
of
malts
nutty
flavors
maybe
a
tiny
bit
of
sweet
chocolate
and
a
hop
aftertaste
to
finish
the
beer
as
with
the
smell
it
seems
to
fade
to
nutty
flavorsmalts
with
a
hoppymetallic
after
taste
which
takes
away
from
the
beer
for
me
to
me
the
beer
just
has
a
plain
brown
ale
taste
to
it
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
has
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
flavor
coating
on
the
mouth
no
noticeable
alcohol
at
all
in
this
one
either
for
my
drinkability
system
it
is
decent
the
beer
is
not
the
greatest
tasting
which
factors
in
a
lot
for
drinkability
it
was
cheap
for
a
craft
beer
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
the
flavors
fading
over
time
also
takes
away
here
i
think
this
one
will
taste
bad
after
two
bottles
or
so
overall
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
nothing
that
stands
out
and
asks
you
to
drink
it
a
flawed
beer
in
my
eyes
while
the
appearance
though
producing
a
rather
large
head
is
fairly
colaish
the
other
characteristics
are
quite
pleasant
very
malty
aromas
with
some
roast
and
some
deeper
chocolatey
malts
flavor
is
a
very
smooth
yet
robust
combination
of
caramel
chocolate
and
ome
pale
malts
with
only
the
slightest
touch
of
hoppy
bintterness
mouth
is
wellrounded
and
pleasant
certainly
fullbodied
overall
it
comes
off
pretty
good
definitely
something
that
you
could
enjoy
drinking
several
of
in
a
night
sort
of
like
a
slightlydeeper
or
darker
scotch
ale
in
the
flavor
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
two
inches
of
tan
head
the
color
is
brown
and
a
bit
ruddy
when
held
to
the
light
there
are
sweet
malts
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
plain
i
get
a
little
roasted
malt
but
not
enough
to
get
excited
about
this
is
just
an
average
beer
not
great
but
not
bad
pours
a
two
finger
white
head
with
a
light
brown
see
through
color
the
smell
is
very
faint
almost
nothing
there
there
is
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
of
a
sweet
malt
with
notes
of
caramel
there
is
a
very
slight
hop
bitterness
to
round
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
slight
carbonation
and
is
smooth
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
the
taste
is
above
average
but
the
smell
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
d
if
the
taste
was
a
bit
better
i
could
drink
more
of
this
but
the
alcohol
and
the
body
make
me
think
one
is
enough
better
than
a
new
castle
worth
a
try
but
its
a
brown
that
i
wouldnt
care
to
drink
more
than
one
of
cheers
another

with

finish
uniquely

for

sweet
malts
pleasantly
balance
out
the
rather
subdued

as
advertisedthis
is
smoothdrinking
and
textured
enough
to
provoe
thought
on
its
flavor
as
saranac
goes
a
solid
yearround
contributor
first
taste
has
some
slight
bitterness
to
it
not
sweet
like
it
smells
taste
stays
on
the
front
part
of
the
tongue
it
does
subside
and
gets
out
of
the
way
for
my
next
sip
though
which
i
think
is
good
rest
of
the
sips
i
have
pretty
much
stay
the
same
a
good
white
cap
atop
a
slightly
murky
ruby
brown
body
light
scents
mostly
caramel
sweetness
some
nutty
scents
and
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
the
same
straight
forward
and
typical
in
the
mouth
you
could
consider
it
just
a
tad
thin
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
not
the
most
drinkable
brown
ive
had
final
thoughts
not
bad
just
another
run
of
the
mill
brown
part
of
a
variety
six
pack
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
color
of
brown
with
hints
of
red
in
it
while
looking
through
at
a
light
the
tan
head
slowly
dissipates
but
the
beer
leaves
good
lace
as
you
finish
aroma
of
chocolate
and
caramel
mixed
together
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
medium
bodied
with
more
of
the
chocolate
and
caramel
coming
in
nicely
ends
with
a
nice
dry
lightly
hoppy
finish
very
good
beer
d
a
tasty
beer
smooth
and
enjoyable
d
id
have
a
few
before
trying
something
else
if
it
were
offered
in
quantity
overall
a
rather
average
brown
ale
flavor
is
unified
but
needs
more
going
on
its
drinkable
but
oh
so
boring
even
for
a
basic
brown
d
its
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
the
flavors
kind
of
remind
me
of
those
haribo
soda
bottle
gummies
with
that
licorice
flavor
thats
the
flavor
got
it
its
an
absolute
interesting
flavor
coming
out
the
aroma
is
bit
on
the
side
of
suck
but
its
manageable
this
isnt
a
mind
blowing
brown
ale
at
all
just
pretty
mediocre
d
a
worthy
brown
ale
although
not
spectacular
not
too
bad
to
drink
but
the
carbonation
makes
it
a
little
harder
light
medium
level
of
carbonation
as
per
the
brown
ale
style
highly
drinkable
if
i
enjoyed
it
more
i
love
brown
ales
and
this
one
is
interesting
good
but
not
great
after
its
great
appearance
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
d
nice
full
bodied
beer
with
some
complex
flavors
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
pours
a
nice
deep
brownred
has
a
foamy
head
and
lacing
left
all
the
way
down
the
glass
had
a
hint
of
citrus
but
nuts
and
grain
were
the
main
scent
taste
was
pretty
good
one
of
those
beers
where
the
taste
matched
the
smell
finish
was
nice
as
there
was
enough
hops
to
linger
on
the
taste
buds
for
a
while
after
each
drink
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
brown
ales
but
this
was
definitely
one
i
could
enjoy
well
enough
its
simple
and
not
groundbreaking
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
d
a
brew
true
to
brown
ale
form
but
nothing
unusual
or
makes
it
a
stand
out
oh
any
thinnish
beer
that
tastes
good
is
very
drinkable
best
with
a
meal
or
as
a
malty
gatorade
moment
not
to
be
sipped
i
mean
nothing
unpleasant
if
savored
but
thats
the
key
nothing
or
almost
nothing
damn
i
am
disappointed
i
really
like
saranac
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
amberruby
with
a
frothy
white
head
there
is
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
bit
more
citrus
than
i
was
expecting
there
is
also
some
notes
of
chocolate
malt
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
the
malt
is
plesantly
sweet
with
just
enough
hops
to
make
it
interesting
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
it
could
use
a
bit
more
body
but
it
is
other
wise
pretty
good
a
solid
brown
ale
and
better
than
most
of
saranacs
offerings
nicely
sessionable
for
an
american
brown
as
well
d
very
serviceable
brown
ale
nice
flavor
and
very
approachable
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
and
an
easy
drinker
overall
this
was
a
decent
brown
but
im
a
bit
disappointed
i
didnt
get
any
of
the
hops
that
it
seems
other
reviewers
had
d
excellent
nothing
jumps
out
at
you
about
this
brew
its
just
a
nice
session
brown
that
makes
one
decent
brew
for
saranac
not
a
great
beer
not
a
bad
beer
overall
averageness
i
guess
that
is
what
i
expect
from
a
brown
ale
usually
which
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
rate
them
high
i
didnt
care
too
much
for
this
one
because
of
the
plain
and
bitterness
of
this
brew
sucks
because
i
enjoy
brown
ales
like
sam
smith
poured
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
no
353707387
the
pour
is
a
nice
looking
mahogany
brown
with
a
small
amount
of
offwhite
head
that
fizzles
in
short
order
sugarysweet
malts
overpower
the
aroma
that
is
the
most
obvious
feature
upon
first
whiff
but
it
is
appealing
mouthfeel
is
a
little
better
than
medium
with
good
stability
after
swirling
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
very
sugary
and
malty
this
has
to
be
the
sweetest
tasting
brown
ale
i
have
ever
had
my
only
question
was
where
are
the
nuts
md
not
as
fullbodied
as
better
brown
ales
moderate
carbonation
its
alright
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
havent
encountered
something
like
this
before
the
malty
sweetness
with
hops
seemed
to
be
meshed
just
right
or
at
least
to
my
liking
this
was
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
pretty
good
tasting
beer
taste
the
breadiness
some
sweet
malt
and
finishes
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
bite
warming
as
it
goes
down
good
carbonation
a
little
on
the
high
side
fairly
drinkable
recommend
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
big
tan
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
as
if
for
dear
life
smells
very
sweet
like
molasses
with
very
toasty
malts
and
trace
amount
of
alcohol
detectable
its
much
sweeter
than
the
earthiness
of
several
other
brown
ales
that
ive
tried
but
i
like
it
a
lot
a
solid
brown
ale
flavor
that
with
a
nice
burnt
bitterness
not
the
most
complicated
brown
ale
in
the
world
but
definitely
appealing
very
drinkable
all
on
its
own
or
with
any
beer
snack
under
the
sun
probably
my
favorite
saranac
beer
overall
this
one
is
just
okay
for
me
nothing
outstanding
here
that
makes
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
really
impressive
either
pours
an
amber
color
a
rich
soapy
1
finger
head
quickly
dissolves
but
the
small
ring
leaves
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
a
mix
of
malt
chocolatey
and
hops
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
with
a
mild
malt
flavor
in
the
background
i
wish
this
was
a
little
more
bold
and
less
hoppy
average
mouthfeel
would
have
liked
this
a
little
thicker
beer
has
a
good
drinkability
not
heavy
i
just
would
like
a
more
hearty
brown
drinkability
is
average
i
have
three
more
and
i
plan
on
drinking
them
but
i
wont
get
this
again
deep
copper
color
barely
any
head
what
so
ever
smell
is
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
taste
is
quite
cloying
with
a
dry
finish
that
converts
into
bitterness
at
the
end
seems
quite
poorly
constructed
and
unbalanced
even
the
mouthfeel
seems
off
very
thin
and
watery
yet
overloaded
with
carbonation
poured
a
mahogany
color
with
a
nice

good
retention

a
deep

aroma
with

aroma
maltiness
came
off
sweet
tasted
of
roasted
nut
small
hints
of
chocolate
and
carmelization
elements
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
not
as
robust
as
alot
of
other
browns
overall
very
drinkable
and
has
just
enough
bite
to
keep
your
attention
strange
to
see
a
plain
brown
ale
as
a
seasonal
but
leave
it
to
saranac
to
make
little
sense
of
a
mix
pack
the
added
abv
works
with
this
brew
and
is
just
another
minute
detail
with
lends
this
ale
some
intrigue
a
decent
beer
not
a
good
one
not
nearly
as
good
as
some
other
browns
ive
had
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
indeed
a
dark
rootbeerlike
brown
color
with
some
hints
of
maroon
and
a
sandcolored
head
the
head
was
onefinger
thick
displayed
rather
poor
retention
and
some
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
was
semisweet
a
combination
of
caramel
malt
and
toasted
malt
and
some
brown
sugar
the
flavors
were
also
very
malt
dominated
at
first
but
faded
towards
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
neither
the
malt
nor
the
hops
were
very
assertive
and
their
generic
characters
were
not
well
balanced
the
finish
in
particular
was
a
little
too
bitter
hints
of
butter
appeared
as
it
warmed
the
body
was
medium
the
mouthfeel
average
and
a
little
oily
just
another
beer
really
and
not
one
worth
seeking
out
ive
had
better
and
ive
had
worse
a
solid
drinkable
ale
another
solid
and
affordable
brew
from
the
folks
at
saranac
i
cant
say
that
i
can
recommend
this
one
id
call
it
average
at
best
and
thats
likely
a
bit
of
a
stretch
it
looks
great
but
could
use
work
just
about
everywhere
else
please
tinker
with
this
one
a
bit
more
saranac
3
5
d
not
a
bad
beer
its
nothing
special
in
terms
of
taste
and
overall
quality
but
its
not
overly
boring
d
drinkable
could
have
a
pair
but
the
lack
of
character
in
this
brew
which
seems
to
be
a
common
trend
throughout
saranac
beers
would
make
it
a
dubious
decision
should
eb
thicker
and
a
stronger
malt
flavor
as
with
most
saranacs
a
very
average
example
of
the
style
drinkability
very
drinkable
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
this
was
an
above
average
brown
ale
some
good
nutty
taste
to
it
and
superior
drinkability
cant
beat
the
price
either
this
is
one
of
the
best
saranac
has
to
offer
in
my
opinion
much
better
than
some
higher
rated
ones
on
this
site
dthe
beer
looks
good
in
the
glass
thats
the
best
i
can
really
say
way
too
light
in
taste
and
body
and
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
unpleasant
not
a
very
good
brown
ale
at
all
drinkability
easy
drinking
but
not
a
good
example
of
a
brown
ale
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
really
large
3
finger
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
caramel
and
citrusy
hops
the
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
with
some
coffee
and
the
hops
coming
along
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
this
saranac
offering
is
better
than
i
expected
one
of
the
better
beers
from
this
brewery
overall
saranac
brown
ale
is
a
pretty
solid
american
style
brown
ale
that
is
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
creamy
more
than
i
would
have
expected
drinkability
is
excellent
i
know
we
have
definitions
for
session
beer
but
this
is
one
i
could
sit
around
and
drink
in
mass
quantities
very
nice
drinkability
i
found
this
one
very
impressive
from
a
true
6
pack
variety
pack
with
six
different
beers
points
for
that
easy
drinking
and
very
smooth
with
good
flavor
i
would
definititely
get
this
again
the
beer
pours
a
dark
tawny
color
with
a
full
frothy
and
creamy
head
modest
carbonation
for
a
brown
ale
the
beer
has
nice
head
retention
and
laces
the
aroma
is
quite
good
sweet
malts
chocolate
notes
brown
ale
malts
a
bit
of
the
earthy
and
musty
hops
as
well
the
taste
is
quite
dry
perhaps
a
bit
nutty
but
this
is
buried
deep
within
there
is
a
definite
toasted
chocolatey
malt
presence
throughout
there
is
a
bit
of
a
dry
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
there
is
also
more
than
a
touch
of
bittering
malty
caramel
in
this
beer
the
finish
is
dry
the
aftertaste
lingers
a
bit
longer
than
is
needed
there
is
a
definite
bracing
and
slightly
metallic
quality
to
the
finish
and
beyond
the
beer
is
reasonably
refreshing
light
to
medium
bodied
and
a
solid
saranac
beer
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
poors
a
darkish
brown
with
amber
highlights
and
two
fingers
of
quickly
receiding
tan
foam
smells
of
sweet
roasted
malts
with
floral
and
grassy
hops
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
with
a
rather
un
brownish
grassy
hop
flavor
the
flavor
is
there
but
not
at
all
robust
of
prominent
the
mouth
feel
was
too
thin
for
me
and
that
also
unfortunatly
took
away
from
the
drinkability
a
bit
d
although
i
found
this
beer
pretty
average
in
most
respects
it
is
very
easy
drinking
and
i
can
easily
see
sitting
back
at
home
and
enjoying
several
of
these
on
a
nice
spring
or
fall
afternoon
this
beer
pours
a
dark
red
with
ruby
highlights
it
has
an
off
white
thick
head
that
diminishes
slowly
the
aroma
is
of
nice
noble
hops
the
taste
is
fairly
balanced
with
a
bit
of
dark
malt
maybe
black
patent
aftertaste
the
hop
aroma
is
bigger
than
the
hop
flavor
there
is
some
bitterness
left
behind
making
it
a
little
more
bitter
than
sweet
however
the
hop
flavor
is
covered
up
by
the
malts
the
body
is
light
and
refreshing
not
a
bad
brown
overall
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
i
almost
always
cant
stand
brown
ales
but
this
one
is
growing
on
me
i
had
one
last
night
and
wasnt
a
huge
fan
but
i
think
my
tastes
must
have
changed
overnight
this
is
basically
a
dessert
beer
i
cant
say
im
usually
a
fan
of
sweet
tasting
beer
but
when
you
accept
this
for
what
it
is
you
start
to
realize
how
much
it
tastes
like
a
quality
dessert
item
its
like
a
caramel
chocolate
cake
with
coffee
liquor
soaked
into
it
its
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
all
night
actually
just
the
thought
of
that
gives
me
a
tickle
in
the
back
of
my
throat
like
i
just
guzzled
pure
maple
syrup
no
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
drank
one
at
a
time
its
a
beer
you
drink
very
slowly
which
would
make
it
a
great
beer
to
end
the
night
on
i
think
i
like
this
beer
so
much
because
its
a
bit
more
like
a
porter
than
a
brown
ale
i
didnt
think
i
could
ever
warm
up
to
a
brown
ale
probably
because
sam
adams
brown
ale
is
so
bad
that
i
still
have
a
hole
in
my
soul
but
this
one
crosses
over
this
is
not
undrinkable
by
any
means
but
a
bit
more
malt
and
more
subtle
hops
profile
would
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
i
would
recommend
this
one
i
think
its
the
best
in
the
sampler
but
the
ipa
gave
it
a
run
for
its
money
the
malthops
combination
isnt
balanced
well
with
the
hops
overpowering
the
brew
not
a
bad
drink
but
not
a
very
good
brown
ale
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
smallish
head
and
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
nose
is
strong
on
sweet
caramel
malt
a
touch
of
dried
fruit
toffee
malt
is
the
main
flavor
and
then
a
lot
of
nuttiness
as
well
a
very
mild
hint
of
hops
and
a
fair
bit
of
graininess
as
well
body
is
nice
and
smooth
another
one
that
far
exceeded
my
expectations
the
saranac
stuff
for
the
price
is
pretty
solid
overall
d
this
one
has
okay
flavors
but
really
i
want
more
flavor
out
of
my
beer
smooth
and
slick
with
a
medium
body
that
coats
the
tongue
a
little
plenty
of
carbonation
but
not
too
much
d
notes
this
is
a
decent
beer
would
have
liked
some
more
specific
taste
characteristics
normally
i
find
brown
ales
to
either
be
off
balance
or
uninterestingly
sessionable
but
this
is
quite
extraordinary
it
strikes
a
great
balance
between
the
intensity
of
sam
smiths
nut
brown
and
the
mildness
of
newcastle
not
quite
as
funky
as
petes
and
overall
a
fantastic
brew
pours
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
lacing
and
a
little
shortlived
head
very
modest
scent
a
little
malty
but
nothing
very
much
to
detect
excellent
taste
though
a
very
nice
malty
brown
ale
with
great
nut
flavors
as
well
very
balanced
and
very
smooth
a
nice
brown
ale
honestly
one
of
the
better
saranac
ales
ive
had
brew
pours
to
a
nice
deep
but
clear
brown
color
with
a
good
sized
light
tan
head
that
has
pretty
good
retention
while
leaving
heavy
sheets
of
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
malty
caramel
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
maple
syrup
smell
the
flavors
are
quite
good
started
a
little
odd
with
the
hop
break
at
the
tail
end
but
i
have
warmed
up
to
it
caramel
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
come
to
mind
at
first
then
at
the
tail
end
it
breaks
to
a
well
identified
hop
flavor
hops
specified
are
cascade
and
columbus
though
it
does
not
have
the
taste
i
would
recognize
with
cascade
so
feel
the
columbus
had
been
used
in
a
greater
amount
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
a
nice
addition
to
the
mixed
12
pack
as
with
most
saranac
brews
it
is
not
outstanding
but
good
to
very
good
the
brown
ale
forms
a
thick
light
tan
head
that
sits
on
top
of
a
clear
dark
amber
brew
the
head
makes
nice
lacing
as
it
sides
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
malts
on
the
tongue
caramel
and
maple
sweet
malts
give
way
to
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
the
palate
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
average
carbonation
saranacs
brown
ale
is
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
ok
beer
but
not
stellar
d
i
wont
turn
down
a
free
one
but
this
is
not
a
very
good
brown
ale
overall
its
really
not
bad
nothing
offensive
or
off
just
not
the
greatest
example
of
the
style
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
a
second
or
third
either
the
star
of
this
12
pack
sampler
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
was
a
pretty
ruby
redbrown
color
with
a
thick
white
head
ample
lacing
a
sweet
chocolate
aroma
with
a
little
malt
chocolate
taste
a
little
late
hoppiness
malt
background
pleasant
beer
maybe
just
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
fun
to
drink
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
chimay
chalice
the
appearance
is
a
amber
brown
with
a
1
inch
beige
head
that
melted
away
into
a
thin
beige
layer
sitting
on
top
of
the
liquid
tiny
threads
of
lacing
stick
on
the
glass
aroma
is
powdered
chocolate
and
then
hops
its
kind
of
an
interesting
aroma
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
its
chocolaty
up
front
with
a
bit
of
toffee
and
the
finish
has
a
hoppy
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
highly
carbonated
its
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
pours
with
an
average
head
with
various
flavors
coming
out
even
flow
to
it
has
nice
color
to
it
saranac
has
donr
better
but
this
ale
has
a
drinkablilty
to
it
before
you
know
it
5
or
6
are
down
average
beer
verdict
worth
buying
if
youre
looking
for
a
drinkable
brown
ale
im
not
big
on
brown
ales
but
i
like
this
one
d
very
drinkable
beer
great
small
and
good
flavor
are
always
a
solid
combination
i
had
easily
enjoy
this
as
a
session
brew
good
body
nice
and
smooth
and
not
overcarbonated
this
one
could
be
a
good
session
beer
and
as
many
from
this
brewery
a
good
crossover
beer
notes
i
avoid
this
beerbut
if
someone
handed
me
a
free
one
i
would
drink
it
because
there
are
many
beers
that
are
so
much
worse
for
its
style
it
lacks
and
as
brown
ale
is
my
first
love
i
can
not
easily
forgive
its
flaws
this
is
a
pretty
good
brown
ale
it
poured
with
a
translucent
deep
brown
color
and
a
big
sticky
head
the
taste
featured
some
roasted
grain
sweet
malt
a
hint
of
chocolate
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
vegetable
the
mouthfeel
is
good
if
a
little
thin
the
beer
just
kind
of
feels
mass
produced
overall
its
an
easy
to
drink
take
on
the
style
d
fine
easy
to
drink
for
sure
and
id
have
one
if
it
were
placed
in
front
of
me
given
the
choice
though
there
are
better
brown
ales
id
rather
have
m
d
body
is
reasonable
with
a
nice
snap
of
carbonation
when
coupled
with
a
meal
chickenpesto
pizza
in
this
case
it
becomes
nicer
to
drink
but
i
dont
really
see
myself
drinking
much
of
this
one
on
its
own
d
great
this
is
a
well
thought
out
brew
good
sessionable
and
well
rounded
i
can
see
trying
this
one
again
reco
i
usually
issue
the
standard
caveat
with
judging
brown
ale
that
this
is
far
from
my
favorite
style
this
beer
falls
in
line
with
many
other
brown
ales
ive
tried
its
fairly
good
certainly
drinkable
but
not
a
wow
beer
not
one
to
demand
repurchasing
decent
and
refreshing
like
the
majority
of
saranac
wares
ive
tried
im
done
with
the
saranac
sampler
session
and
am
rather
glad
for
it
a
couple
very
good
beers
but
more
middleoftheroad
beers
its
alright
but
there
is
room
for
improvement
pretty
average
i
wouldnt
pick
this
over
other
browns
in
all
honesty
i
would
consider
this
an
average
brown
ale
not
really
anything
that
id
buy
again
but
still
decent
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
it¬ís
a
pretty
decent
brown
ale
that
like
most
brown
ales
you
won¬ít
be
drinking
a
large
amount
of
due
to
it
being
somewhat
filling
but
it
is
one
that
can
be
enjoyed
regularly
as
it
is
much
like
many
other
saranac
brew
a
good
solid
example
of
the
style
not
entirely
interesting
or
particularly
special
but
a
fine
example
d
quite
drinkable
and
a
nice
brew
in
the
saranac
arsenal
the
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
with
fluffy
longlasting
head
the
smell
is
mostly
of
sweet
malts
hops
and
a
little
bit
of
yeast
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
sweetness
thats
cut
by
a
hop
bite
and
a
little
bit
of
smokiness
on
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
and
the
beer
sits
a
little
heavy
for
me
to
immediately
want
to
grab
another
one
fairly
drinkable
acceptable
as
a
winter
session
beer
if
the
taste
suits
you
another
sample
drink
from
saranac
the
appearance
was
pretty
good
brownamberish
colors
with
a
really
thick
head
the
smell
had
hints
of
roast
malt
grain
and
some
chocolate
the
taste
was
bitter
but
a
little
lacking
in
any
of
the
aroma
flavors
it
was
way
too
watery
the
mouthfeel
was
then
utterly
unimpressive
overall
the
drink
looks
good
but
the
taste
and
feel
are
way
too
thin
and
watery
it
was
a
medium
sized
beer
that
was
quite
filling
definitley
an
enjoyable
beer
after
a
meal
but
before
a
desert
it
would
go
well
with
a
cheesecake
or
canoly
much
as
a
good
stout
would
which
i
think
says
something
about
the
range
of
the
brown
ale
although
filling
it
does
not
negate
your
craving
for
another
beingthat
it
was
just
that
good
of
a
beer
a
problem
that
i
usually
encounter
with
brown
ale
saranac

12

a
slight

kinda

aroma
malty
flavor
w
plenty
of

flavor
not
quite
balanced
a
little
thin
on
the
palate
for
the
flavor
an
otherwise
drinkable
beer
the
taste
is
nice
enough
it
has
a
nut
caramel
with
some
coffe
as
well
its
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
finish
and
worth
a
try
its
not
the
best
brown
ale
ive
ever
had
but
its
very
good
just
the
same
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
that
i
enjoyed
right
off
the
bat
this
produced
a
nice
foamy
two
fingers
worth
of
eggshellwhite
head
the
color
was
a
carmelcolor
brown
with
amber
highlights
the
nose
was
malty
sweet
and
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
i
got
a
nice
jolt
of
chocolate
on
the
tongue
and
the
finish
had
both
a
smoky
and
a
sweet
flavor
to
it
kind
of
like
semisweet
chocolate
this
was
quite
enjoyable
especially
after
a
day
of
administering
a
highstakes
test
to
high
school
11th
grade
students
a
nice
way
to
unwind
without
numbing
myself
with
hops
this
is
the
best
ive
tasted
from
saranac
a
nice
surprise
a
clean

minimal

slight

nice

less
than
i
like
in
a
brown
ale
but
it
works
with
the
mild
malts
slight
smokiness
on
the
backend
lends
some
complexity
like
other
saranac
offerings
this
one
is
watered
down
but
somehow
this
time
it
works
light
bodied
and
sessionable
drinkability
not
a
brown
ale
saranac
beers
are
not
that
bad
bought
this
is
a
winter
pack
dark
brown
with
a
touch
of
red
head
is
mediumsized
light
tan
frothy
and
slow
to
diminish
leaving
a
good
bit
of
sticky
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
nice
and
hoppy
for
a
brown
ale
pine
and
chocolate
malt
are
most
prevalent
the
taste
is
definitely
more
malty
than
the
nose
molasses
spice
and
citrus
rind
the
finish
is
bitter
citrusy
and
lightly
floral
it
has
a
mediumfull

and
soft

this
is
a
very
pleasant
offering
from
saranac
bigger
than
i
was
expecting
from
them
nothing
really
outstanding
but
nothing
out
of
place
12oz
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
with
a
big
frothy
head
decent
longevity
and
nice
lace
aromas
of
subtle
but
decent
caramel
malts
with
a
decent
citrus
and
ale
fruityness
upon
tasting
you
get
a
fair
amount
of
hop
flavor
citrusy
with
some
bitterness
unfortunately
the
malt
presence
is
too
low
to
balance
the
nice
hop
flavor
a
nicely
made
beer
but
not
quite
balanced
enough
d
very
well
done
wellbalanced
and
integrated
bright
bold
american
the
beer
pours
a
nice
ruby
redbrown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
semisweet
malt
nose
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
its
balanced
well
with
a
nice
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
crisp
flavor
that
has
hints
of
chocolate
and
crystal
malts
it
is
quite
bitter
and
hoppy
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
too
much
carboination
this
is
an
average
brown
ale
at
best
i
like
the
hops
but
they
are
more
pronounced
than
the
malts
i
like
a
maltier
brown
ale
especially
ones
that
are
hoppy
also
the
co2
needs
to
be
reduced
a
bit
not
a
bad
stab
but
there
are
better
browns
out
there
maybe
this
should
be
classified
as
a
pale
brown
or
something
else
to
signify
the
hop
presense
unbalanced
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
for
the
style
but
not
highly
unpleasant
a
slightly
above
average
brown
ale
marred
by
the
rough
and
overspiced
floral
hop
character
drinkability
decently
drinkable
but
the
unbalanced
nature
of
this
beer
hurts
it
a
bit
at
least
from
what
is
expected
a
decent
effort
would
go
good
with
a
chocolate
dessert
an
average
beer
compared
to
the
style
not
exactly
textbook
definition
of
flavors
worthy
a
try
out
of
the
mixed
pack
but
not
much
else
i
dont
know
this
is
actually
okay
but
i
think
it
misses
its
style
mark
saranac
have
tried
so
many
different
styles
a
zillion
and
six
or
something
now
being
halfway
through
their
winter
12pack
sampler
i
feel
like
they
could
do
better
by
reeling
it
in
and
putting
their
efforts
into
just
a
few
styles
playing
on
their
strengths
rather
than
thinning
themselves
out
and
losing
focus
but
they
didnt
ask
me
and
why
should
they
medium

the
hoppy
bitterness
is
a
nice
sharp
contrast
to
the
thick

its

this
is

beer
clear
and
shadowy
with

the
first
aroma
is
of
american
hops
it
has
a
citric
grapefruit
quality
with
some
fresh
floral
smells
right
behind
the
hops
though
are
some
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
smells
they¬íre
not
intense
but
they
compose
a
nice

to
the
beer
the
flavor
is
fairly
dry
with
a
nice
mix
between
some

hops
and
a
highlyroasted
maltiness
the
carbonation
is
fairly
high
maybe
more
than
is
necessary

i
love

why
does
their

taste
hoppier
than
their
ipa
does
another
easy

middle
of
the
road
saranac
beer
so
far
this
is
the
best
out
of
the
12
beers
of
christmas
pack
right
off
the
beer
looks
really
good
nice
brown
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
lacin
does
stay
throughout
someone
else
said
it
before
but
i
too
was
very
suprised
by
the
taste
very
hoppy
tasting
right
in
the
start
that
lends
way
to
a
kind
of
grassy
grapefruitlike
taste
no
caramel
no
coffee
just
not
what
i
really
expected
out
of
a
brown
ale
that
being
said
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
id
love
to
ry
this
on
tap
something
im
noticing
about
saranac
beers
as
i
get
through
the
sampler
is
their
lack
of
mouthfeel
or
maybe
its
that
they
all
taste
the
same
its
like
they
started
with
a
beer
and
just
added
slight
things
to
call
it
something
else
kind
of
strange
fairly
reserved
appearance
subtle
yet
a
bit
enticing
with
solid
lacing
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
hoppy
with
citrus
notes
coming
through
with
only
a
tiny
hint
of
malt
sweetness
i
would
definitely
prefer
to
smell
more
sweet
malts
in
there
as
well
as
taste
them
its
odd
to
me
to
drink
a
brown
ale
with
this
much
hoppiness
to
it
at
the
same
time
its
not
really
a
turn
off
either
just
not
what
i
expect
out
of
a
brown
ale
perhaps
it
needs
to
mature
a
bit
longer
this
experience
is
really
like
drinking
a
solid
american
pale
ale
rather
than
a
brown
if
you
want
a
sweet
and
mild
brown
ale
go
with
an
english
one
however
this
is
worth
a
try
because
its
still
a
smoothdrinking
citrusyspicy
hoppy
brew
good
roasty
flavor
after
a
sip
followed
by
a
polite
helping
of
hops
nothing
overpowering
altogether
a
surprisingly
good
beer
by
saranac
even
though
it
does
quite
a
bit
remind
me
of
a
sammy
a
d
not
bad
this
one
was
different
from
most
brown
ales
which
l
liked
could
use
a
touch
of
tweeking
but
could
easily
be
an
innovative
brew
worth
trying
another
new
offering
from
matt
and
i
really
like
where
they
were
going
with
this
one
poured
a
medium
chesnut

a
thinner

well

a
healthy

intertwined
with

the
flavors
dont
quite
live
up
to
the
nose
but
it
has
its
own
character
quite
dry
and
resiny
with
lighter
chocolate
and
caramel
tones
good
to
see
matt
push
the
bar
a
little
with
this

nice

very
drinkable

i
agree
with
another
rater
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
box
which
is
not
saying
a
great
deal
but
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
and
worthy
brown
ale
from
the
2006
winter
sampler
interesting
take
imo
not
really
on
style
but
one
of
the
better
selections
in
the
sampler
look
is
right
on
style
with
very
good
lacing
which
keeps
for
entire
drink
not
much
aroma
but
the
taste
is
what
is
most
surprising
the
first
thing
you
taste
is
the
hoppiness
of
the
beer
which
almost
immediately
gives
way
to
a
licorice
flavor
no
chocolate
to
speak
of
but
a
hint
of
roastiness
not
much
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
while
not
a
traditional
take
very
good
nonetheless
the
taste
is
more
of
that
citrusy
and
grassy
hops
with
a
distinct
nuttiness
in
the
background
very
little
malt
character
blindfolded
you
could
almost
mistake
it
for
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
the
hops
were
that
prevelant
dont
get
me
wrong
it
wasnt
an
awful
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
brown
ale
and
this
sure
didnt
taste
like
one
mouthfeel
was
chewy
and
full
its
a
fairly
drinkable
ale
really
its
not
bad
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
not
a
good
example
of
a
brown
in
my
opinion
winter
pack
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
big
thick
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
has
a
fairly
malty
smell
to
it
with
hints
of
fruitiness
and
nutiness
the
taste
goes
along
with
the
smell
suprisingly
malty
with
a
definate
fruitiness
and
nutiness
not
very
bitter
has
a
lighter
feel
in
the
mouth
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
one
i
would
suggest
to
others
d
i
have
noticed
that
all
saranac
beers
taste
somewhat
similar
and
that
disappoints
me
because
i
have
held
saranac
in
high
esteem
since
my
earliest
introduction
to
craft
brewed
beers
i
will
continue
to
give
them
a
shot
in
hopes
of
a
turnaround
highly
carbonated
almost
overflowed
in
my
pint
glass
with
a
moderate
pour
appealing
red
hue
with
a
very
large
thick
head
of
big
tan
bubbles
aroma
catches
me
off
guard¬Ö
a
bit
of
a
centennial
hop
nose
light
sweet
grapefruit
taste
is
rich
with
a
nice
blend
of
the
citrus
hops
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
lingering
pleasant
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
no
where
near
what
i
was
expecting
a
very
pleasant
surprise
a
departure
from
the
same
old
sweetburntmusty
brown
ales
but
not
quite
the
same
as
a
regular
pale
ale
or
hoppy
amber
great
beer
drinkability
decent
brown
ale
that
can
be
considered
a
session
beer
not
a
flavor
cutting
edge
brown
ale
but
a
solid
offering
worth
trying
i
think
saranac
may
have
a
winner
here
in
their
mixed
twelve
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
of
the
twelve
and
one
of
their
better
offerings
it
is
not
a
fantastic
brown
but
id
consider
it
a
nice
light
session
beer
its
good
enough
to
enjoy
but
not
complex
or
interesting
enough
to
make
you
really
think
about
it
fairly
generic
as
brown
ales
go
poured
12
oz
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
the
appearance
was
quite
nice
a
fullbodied
dark
brown
color
with
a
offwhite
head
the
head
was
so
thick
that
i
had
some
problems
smelling
the
contents
of
the
beer
a
slight
tilt
towards
the
nostrils
exposed
the
hoppy
smell
at
first
all
i
tasted
was
hops
but
about
a
quarter
to
halfway
through
the
beer
the
slightly
chocalate
malt
began
to
show
itself
being
balanced
off
by
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
not
as
thick
as
i
had
hoped
it
to
be
once
you
get
into
the
beer
its
pretty
drinkable
but
the
hops
hit
you
on
the
first
sip
about
as
hoppy
as
a
pale
ale
a
hoppy
brown
ale
from
saranac
whod
expect
that
its
not
up
to
an
indian
brown
but
the
hops
are
on
par
with
at
least
an
average
tasting
pale
ale
the
brown
does
get
a
little
lost
in
here
theres
a
hint
of
malt
in
the
aroma
with
a
little
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
in
the
flavor
but
grassy
and
citrus
hops
dominate
this
brown
that
not
necessarily
bad
but
this
beer
would
stand
up
better
with
more
of
a
malt
profile
to
compete
with
the
hops
overall
an
easy
drinking
brown
ale
a
step
up
from
the
nut
brown
not
very
good
i
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
there
was
a
ton
of
head
with
a
good
retention
time
that
left
lots
of
sticky
lace
the
smell
was
very
sweet
and
reminded
me
of
wisky
the
taste
was
also
sweet
too
but
not
that
bad
the
malt
wasnt
blended
very
well
dont
drink
and
review
i
like
sweeter
maltier
brown
ales
but
this
is
an
ok
example
of
a
quite
dry
moderately
hopped
one
a
decent
addition
to
the
winter
sampler
