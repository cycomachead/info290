thanks

good
weizenbock
among
the
best
of
the
beers
produced
by
eisenbahn
good
balance
between
drinkability
and
flavor
overall
impression
a
good
malt
bomb
that
has
some
interesting
wheat
and
weizen
yeast
character
to
make
it
unique
flavors
of
a
doppelbock
married
to
a
weizen
this
beer
sports
an
8
0
abv
that
to
its
credit
you
feel
but
dont
taste
o
easy
drinking
beer
despite
the
8
abv
well
done
weizenbock
another
good
surprise
from
eisenbahn
while
there
are
a
few
good
things
about
this
beer
to
enjoy
it
ultimately
falls
short
for
me
its
drinkable
enough
and
i
find
it
mellows
over
time
not
terrible
some
big
spice
balanced
by
very
soft
body
not
deep
but
goes
down
dangerously
easy
for
the
strength
dont
get
much
actual
wheat
character
but
still
a
solid
weizenbock
cheers
overall
drinkable
but
not
too
exciting
d
good
but
i
cant
shake
the
similarity
to
diet
soda
hmmmm
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
it
is
fairly
thin
and
faintly
watery
it
initially
comes
off
as
a
thicker
triple
but
that
is
not
the
case
d
a
good
weizenbock
not
super
complex
or
estery
but
its
a
solid
effort
conclusion
back
to
the
drawing
board
with
this
one
im
afraid
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
dark
citrus
yeast
slight
alcohol
and
hint
of
wheat
fits
the
style
of
a
weizenbock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
slight
dark
citrus
and
yeast
overall
lacking
in
body
but
good
blend
and
aroma
weak
doesnt
equal
offensive
it
needs
a
bit
more
balance
like
more
malt
on
the
front
but
its
not
a
bad
drop
a
really
good
weizenbock
one
of
the
best
nongerman
examples
ive
had
eisenbahn
again
show
their
skills
in
producing
fine
examples
of
classic
styles
d
weizenbock
more
like
a
dopplebock
i
got
very
little
wheat
flavors
german
style
of
beer
as
you
can
plainly
notice
in
the
name
and
city
its
brewed
culture
done
well
on
both
sides
of
the
playing
field
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
nice
but
as
mentioned
nothing
spectacular
but
well
worthwhile
if
you
happen
to
have
one
fresh
in
hands
in
short
an
outstanding
weizenbock
i
dont
know
how
fresh
it
is
in
the
states
but
in
brazil
it
is
exceptional
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
isnt
what
i
would
like
in
a
weizenbock
its
rather
onedimensional
and
thin
i
dont
want
to
come
off
as
a
style
nazi
but
i
expect
more
bready
complexity
and
stone
fruit
and
more
esters
and
phenols
from
a
weizenbock
drinkability
the
is
batch
03
so
i
am
guessing
it
has
been
a
slow
mover
but
i
found
that
the
age
allowed
the
heat
to
settle
down
and
bring
the
flavors
to
the
front
rather
enjoyable
d
better
then
i
expected
after
tasting
the
sapa
first
overall
i
thinks
its
pretty
good
and
to
style
worth
trying
sometime
the
bottle
i
have
is
different
to
this
one
but
its
still
the
same
abv
and
style
so
prob
just
some
new
labelingthe
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
honeyish
colour
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
one
finger
headit
has
aromas
of
sweet
sticky
date
pudding
and
some
alcohol
laced
candyit
has
an
average
mouthfeel
and
the
palette
is
flooded
with
tastes
of
fruitcake
and
xmas
pudding
not
badnot
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
but
not
bad
disappointing
overall
pleasant
but
nothing
special
d
this
is
a
decent
weizenbock
im
perhaps
not
enjoying
it
at
the
right
time
of
year
but
its
tasty
nonetheless
i
have
rarely
been
disappointed
by
this
brewery
so
far
this
months
choices
are
looking
better
than
last
months
my
fridge
is
at
39
degrees
and
i
thought
that
maybe
that
was
too
cold
for
this
beer
so
i
let
the
glass
sit
for
a
few
minutes
before
drinking
any
more
when
i
got
back
to
it
it
was
easier
to
taste
more
of
the
wheaty
taste
and
maltiness
it
was
still
pretty
sweet
but
still
totally
drinkable
this
seems
like
a
beer
better
for
just
plain
drinking
rather
than
sipping
and
analyzing
so
im
just
gonna
drink
it
up
i
only
have
one
bottle
so
i
dont
know
what
itd
be
like
to
drink
a
bunch
in
a
row
i
think
it
would
be
good
though
vigorosa
is
an
okay
weizenbock
that
suffers
from
comparisons
to
the
top
beers
of
the
style
aventinus
and
the
relatively
new
weihenstephaner
vitus
really
blow
this
beer
out
of
the
water
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
sort
of
simple
and
unsophisticated
in
comparison
to
the
big
german
entries
which
happen
to
be
a
couple
of
my
very
favorite
beers
anyway
this
beer
looks
pretty
good
red
amber
liquid
with
a
dissipating
beige
head
there
are
some
good
wheat
and
fruit
notes
in
the
nose
but
theyre
a
bit
restrained
there
just
isnt
enough
depth
the
flavor
is
too
sweet
and
cloying
for
my
taste
the
flavors
are
syrupy
clove
ripe
banana
and
caramel
malt
there
are
also
some
unpleasant
alcohol
notes
its
not
sharp
but
theres
just
a
bit
of
a
rubbing
alcohol
flavor
around
the
edges
i
sound
down
on
this
beer
but
i
think
its
good
its
just
not
great
i
sure
hope
i
got
a
bad
batch
of
this
beer
and
not
all
of
these
taste
like
this
i
have
no
idea
what
other
batches
taste
like
but
batch
10
relied
too
much
on
the
alcohol
to
get
it
through
if
any
of
the
other
batches
taste
like
this
then
i
fully
doubt
id
ever
drink
this
beer
again
this
beer
poured
with
a
reddishbrown
body
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipated
slowly
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
banana
and
clove
the
flavor
was
pretty
much
the
same
with
some
chocolate
also
coming
through
this
tasted
similar
to
an
aventinus
to
me
but
the
alcohol
was
more
present
in
the
taste
than
an
aventinus
decent
but
needs
a
little
more
refining
ruddy
ruby
and
amber
color
somewhat
viscous
looking
liquid
but
when
you
hold
this
cola
looking
beer
up
to
the
light
you
can
see
a
nice
column
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
great
aromas
of
plum
bread
clove
banana
and
even
some
faint
bubblegum
hops
arent
noticeable
in
the
nose
or
taste
but
the
sweet
fruity
yeast
or
carmelized
malt
is
not
cloying
at
all
great
banana
bread
combo
of
yeast
and
malt
upfront
good
carbonation
lets
the
8
abv
give
some
kiwi
fruit
flavors
but
the
alcohol
doesnt
add
a
warming
feeling
to
the
mouthfeel
pretty
fruity
the
wheat
and
east
flavors
are
shown
in
full
glory
with
this
beer
plus
the
deceptive
alcohol
that
mingles
very
well
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
d
where
is
the
alcohol
who
cares
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
will
do
time
in
my
fridge
again
medium
body
carbonation
seems
a
bit
low
for
the
style
pretty
nice
and
enjoyable
drinkability
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
the
fruity
taste
can
get
annoying
after
a
while
2
beers
is
good
overall
a
very
nice
well
balanced
beer
its
no
vitus
but
not
bad
at
all
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
drinks
pretty
easy
for
the
style
abv
not
a
bad
weizenbock
at
all
the
brewery
calls
it
a
wheat
doppelbock
and
it
is
a
good
at
that
the
color
is
a
little
paler
than
a
normal
doppelbock
but
still
has
a
rich
copper
hue
its
unfiltered
but
the
yeast
was
packed
pretty
tight
on
the
bottom
and
little
clouded
up
the
beer
an
aroma
of
toast
light
caramel
and
some
plum
come
out
at
first
and
later
some
earthy
spice
notes
were
detected
very
inviting
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
fluffs
up
like
a
friendly
pillow
the
flavor
is
clean
with
great
light
caramel
malts
moderate
bitterness
and
is
well
balanced
overall
i
was
rather
impressed
with
this
one
and
found
it
quite
drinkable
but
it
is
not
like
aventinus
or
other
weizenbocks
more
like
a
light
doppelbock
even
though
this
beer
weighs
in
at
a
generous
8
the
alcohol
is
masterfully
hidden
this
fairly
sweet
beer
could
use
more
carbonation
the
size
of
the
bubbles
is
good
right
now
it
could
just
use
a
lot
more
of
them
i
think
it
could
also
use
more
phenolic
spiciness
theres
not
enough
weizen
in
this
weizenbock
drinkability
a
fairly
tasty
weizenbock
with
a
keen
drinkability
d
not
bad
an
overall
good
brew
once
again
a
bit
too
thin
after
a
promising
wellcarbonated
start
still
this
is
an
above
average
take
on
the
style
and
an
encouraging
sign
coming
from
south
america
the
body
is
just
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
but
alcohol
is
wellcovered
lending
to
a
good
drinkability
overall
a
nice
weizenbock
pours
a
five
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring

for

or
surprisingly
quite
decent
unfiltered

i
am
getting
some
roasted
very
consistent
and
smooth
chocolate
a
bit
of
the
banana

quaffable
a
good

not

sweet
prost
beertracker
drinkability
was
decent
due
to
the
overwhelming
sweet
flavor
and
smell
a
hazy
brown
beer
has
a
very
small
off
white
head
dont
blink
because
youll
miss
it
good
strong
banana
and
clove
notes
in
the
aroma
with
the
clove
having
the
upper
hand
the
banana
and
clove
notes
hit
first
in
the
flavor
but
give
way
quickly
a
malty
sweetness
that
has
notes
of
molasses
and
licorice
i
bought
this
bottle
at
stimmels
market
in

my
second
beer
from
cervejaria
sudbrack
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
the
beer
was
dark
copper
color
with
a
very
thin
tan
head
the
smell
is
dark
fruits
and
bananas
mixed
with
pungent
alcohol
a
proper
weizenbock
the
taste
is
the
same
with
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
to
keep
the
flavor
on
the
tongue
long
enough
to
soak
in
a
very
good
weizenbock
one
of
my
favorite
styles
im
very
impressed
with
the
two
offerings
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
brown
with
a
decent
cream
colored
head
the
aroma
is
earthy
fruity
and
grainy
the
taste
is
earthy
sweet
and
malty
slight
banana
flavor
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
seems
well
suited
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
which
id
recommend
hey
a
new
weizenbock
since
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
had
to
try
it
its
a
pretty
good
effort
too
bad
the
brewerys
in
brazil
and
not
the
midwest
taste
is
bitter
tangy
and
a
bit
tart
but
overall
smoky
much
like
the
smoked
lager
also
from
this
brand
the
mouthful
is
hoppy
very
carbonated
perhaps
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
if
you
do
not
enjoy
smokiness
in
your
brew
but
a
quality
choice
which
stands
on
its
own
nonetheless
color
is
a
deep
brown
small
but
persistent
head
nutty
aroma
with
plum
and
some
banana
only
had
one
12
oz
bottle
and
it
went
quickly
most
of
what
ive
had
from

been

good

unfiltered

doublebock
could
be
the
best
one
yet
if
it
was
bigger
and
a
wee
bit
bolder
potentially
exceptional
sinkability

i
dont
know
what
this
is
but
its
not
a
wheat
or
a
bock
really
a
fabulous
beer
poured
with
a
fine
foamy
head
that
settled
down
to
a
light
cover
nice
filtered
clear
maghogany
color
decent
body
for
the

intense
but
classic
weizenbock

flavors
but
with
some
booziness

good

for
the

very
rich

some

and
dark

greet
the
tongue
followed
by
perfect
amount
of
spiciness
not
spicy
as
in
chili
spicy
mind
you
with
a
lingering
sweet
caramel
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
banana
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
but
not
overpowering
its
just
the
right
amount
body
is
full
chewy
but
not
cloying
no
discernable
alcohol
coming
through
truly
an
exceptional
beer
im
glad
i
decided
to
try
it
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
and
will
be
trying
some
of
their
other
products
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
i
could
see
drinking
this
again
very
pleasant
beer
first
wheat
doublebock
ive
tried
i
think
ill
seek
it
out
again
eventually
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
yeasty
sweetly
balanced
and
estery
drinkability
this
was
a
beer
that
one
that
is
easy
to
forget
not
worth
picking
this
up
comment
this
is
my
first
weizenbock
i
am
positive
i
will
have
many
more
if
this
is
indicative
of
the
style
pours
out
a
murk
suede
with
a
strong
billowing
offwhite
head
has
a
candy
sweet
nose
with
ample
chocolate
and
bananas
and
a
nice
clove
undertone
mild
alcohol
comes
out
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
become
a
bit
much
in
the
flavor
although
the
alcohol
isnt
exactly
overpowering
its
more
than
id
like
the
yeasty
complexities
are
there
but
in
the
shadows
of
the
overwhelming
dark
malts
almost
has
an
artificial
sweetener
flavor
to
it
mouthfeel
is
just
a
tad
stick
but
the
carbonation
is
wonderfully
smooth
id
reserve
this
as
a
dessert
beverage
poured
into
a
flute
glass
a
hazy
murky
brown
with
a
slight
lemony
yellow
tinge
a
big
blooming
off
white
head
that
settles
into
a
pillowy
mass
atop
smokey
clove
and
toasty
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
bananalike
fruitfull
near
chewey
mouthfeel
but
it
still
glides
down
very
easilystarts
out
somewhat
spicey
and
clovey
with
hints
of
smoke
and
brown
sugar
but
its
very
light
quite
crisp
and
dry
on
the
palate
in
the
finish
with
a
light
banana
flavor
this
brazilian
brewery
puts
out
some
good
stuff
they
know
what
they
are
doing
this
is
another
fine
example
overall
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
and
is
quite
an
interesting
beer
i
wish
the
flavor
was
a
little
fruiter
and
had
a
stronger
clove
note
to
it
but
is
still
nice
a
fine
beer
but
i
would
rather
aventinus
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
a
decent
creamy
feel
soft
carbonation
doesnt
seem
nearly
as
warming
as
aventinus
a
candy
like
finish
lingers
for
quite
some
time
very
easy
to
drink
great
stuff
i
would
recommend
it
among
other
beers
from
eisenbahn

a
cloudy
murky

brown
mahogany
hue
large
tan
head
with
big

from
about

down
to
just
a

going
on
as
well
the
fruitiness
is
rather
perfumey
flavor
wise
the

clouded
with
spices
and
it
really
dominates
the
effervesent
green
apple
and

dough
powdered

sits
heavy
with

this
beer
is
not
harmonious
its
in

versuses
the
yeast
almost
seems
like
something
of
belgian
character
rather
than
a
german
style
weizenbock
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
even
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chewy
yet
soft
flowing
the
carbonation
gives
this
medium
to
fuller
bodied
brew
enough
moving
power
to
not
sit
on
the
palate
completely
but
once
again
the
yeast
and
spice
characteristics
sit
heavy
on
the
tongue
in
the
finish
in
trainwreck
fashion
drinkability
leaves
more
to
be
desired
for
me
flavor
components
attempt
to
pull
of
cohesion
but
it
lacks
so
much
from
the
german
predecessors
that
id
rather
get
the
original
definitely
complex
and
tasty
but
im
weary
of
supporting
the
shelton
brothers
on
a
regular
basis
this
is
definetly
not
what
people
would
think
of
a
typical
beer
from
brazil
it
is
very
special
pours
a
hazy
reddish
brown
color
quite
murky
smells
like
sweet
old
fruit
sometimes
not
a
good
sign
for
me
taste
though
oh
yeah
does
taste
like
dried
fruit
like
plums
or
apricots
slight
alcohol
hints
in
the
background
but
it
is
really
tasty
and
not
too
fruity
or
overly
sweet
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
that
should
get
some
massive
distribution
and
a
lot
more
attention
not
just
from
this
site
but
the
mass
beer
drinking
public
in
general
as
a
last
thought
irrelevant
to
reviewing
the
beer
i
feel
saudade
is
the
most
beautiful
not
only
of
all
the
words
in
the
portuguese
language
but
of
any
wow
saudade
12
oz
bottle
the
brew
is
a
lightly
ambered
deep
tea
color
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
falls
to
a
patchy
coat
of
very
large
bubbles
clarity
is
very
good
and
there
is
a
small
stream
of
bubbles
from
the
bottom
the
nose
is
a
little
solventy
sweet
with
a
very
sweet
banana
strong
yeasty
and
lighter
bready
charater
with
a
caramel
sweetness
playing
in
the
background
i
like
the
aroma
on
this
one
even
with
the
solventy
sweetness
in
there
the
flavor
is
very
well
blended
with
the
yeasty
softness
and
bready
character
being
prevalent
on
the
start
moving
to
a
mild
banana
and
very
light
raisin
fruityness
and
finishing
with
a
bready
and
caramel
maltyness
i
enjoy
the
juxtoposition
between
the
estery
fruit
and
the
bready
and
yeasty
character
i
think
they
play
well
together
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
moderate
thick
with
a
mild
carbonation
the
contrast
between
the
lighter
carbonation
and
the
thickness
of
the
body
is
good
for
this
one
there
is
a
mild
drying
character
after
taking
a
sip
and
it
really
hangs
on
the
sides
of
my
tongue
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
in
this
one
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
prevalent
but
not
obtrusive
i
think
the
beer
really
blends
together
in
all
aspects
this
one
is
nice
overall
this
is
really
good
but
its
heavy
reallys
sticks
to
the
mouth
and
stomach
good
thing
its
a
regular
12
oz
bottle
so
the
drinkability
seems
a
bit
limited
looking
forward
to
trying
this

well
i
am
impressed
it
was
a
good
but
not
great
weizen
until
that
gear
shift
into
what
my
tastebuds
said
was
almost
an
entirely
different
beer
it
most
definitely
does
not
finish
wimpy
or
weak
and
actually
appears
to
morph
i
will
have
to
try
another
that
is
more
room
temp
to
see
what
its
like
from
the
start
that
way
another
excellent
beer
from
eisenbahn
and
definitely
recommended

dark

beer
with
plenty
of
cloudiness
capped
by

descended
at
a
medium
pace
to
nice
lacings
aroma
is
tons
of
yeast
and
caramel
and
flavor
is
more
of
same
quite
nutty
and
very
present
alcohol
alcohol
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
especially
as
the
beer
warmed
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
small
steady
carbonation
i
like
the
style
a
lot
and
this
is
one
worth
trying
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
this
one
didnt
fill
the
mouth
quite
like
the
aventinus
so
i
docked
it
for
mouthfeel
in
general
it
is
creamy
and
smoothly
full
the
wheat
goes
down
very
smooth
i
absolutely
love
this
style
of
beer
and
this
one
is
just
fine
mouthfeel
is
maybe
a
touch
thin
for
a
weizenbock
but
still
very
smooth
and
just
short
of
creamy
the
drinkability
for
me
is
very
high
as
i
would
have
no
problem
putting
a
few
of
these
down
in
a
night
though
with
the
alcohol
it
might
hurt
a
bit
the
next
day
mouthfeel
is
smooth
not
as
rich
as
aventinus
or
mahrs
but
very
pleasing
and
drinkable
overall
a
solid
weizenbock
eisenbahn
uses
5
types
of
malt
in
the
production
of
this
beer
and
it
really
provides
depth
and
complexity
with
a
different
nuance
of
flavor
revealed
in
every
sip
d
a
tasty
beer
nice
flavors
and
excellent
mouthfeel
brazil
would
not
seem
a
likely
locale
for
brewing
quality
traditional
germaneuro
brews
but
if
this
ones
any
indication
of
whats
typical
im
certain
ill
try
more
from
cervejaria
sudbrack
recommended
matt
if
you
like
higher
alcohol
content
id
recommend
this
if
you
dont
steer
away
maybe
if
i
drank
this
along
with
some
food
i
wouldve
enjoyed
more
but
since
i
drank
it
by
itself
while
watching
a
movie
i
would
ask
for
a
second
one
rather
malty
than
fruity
good
balance
toasted
caramel
spicy
cloves
and
esters
banana
apple
low
bitterness
as
expected
for
the
style
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
poured
a
murky
reddishbrown
color
with
modest
head
smell
is
extraordinarily
enjoyable
with
profound
yeast
and
ester
notes
combining
with
banana
and
cloves
taste
was
also
suprising
seeming
to
be
a
combination
of
a
doublebock
and
a
belgian
ale
with
some
hefeweizen
thrown
in
very
confusing
but
supremely
enjoyable
only
slight
notes
of
alcohol
to
be
found
at
the
finish
which
makes
this
beer
a
bit
scary
i
really
liked
this
beer
first
class
effort
id
recommend
it
way
to
go
brazil
not
overly
impressive
or
lasting
head
on
a
beautifully
hazy
dark
brown
ebony
color
body
the
smell
is
wheaty
but
also
shows
notes
of
pear
apple
and
alcohol
in
the
taste
the
wheat
gets
overwhelmed
by
a
darker
more
roasted
malty
flavor
and
by
the
fruitiness
of
apples
and
pears
already
noticeable
in
the
smell
alcohol
is
clearly
and
excessively
present
8
are
hard
to
hide
for
sure
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
to
clean
the
palate
of
this
excess
of
alcohol
the
finish
and
aftertaste
are
chewy
and
dont
fit
in
the
style
lacking
sweetness
and
a
refreshing
character
something
interesting
here
a
nice
try
but
not
a
success
undrinkable
alone
i
couldnt
drink
half
of
the
330ml
bottle
maybe
paired
with
some
food
it
could
be
a
little
better
two
thousand
miles
behind
aventinus
rodrigo
o
an
enjoyable
experience
but
not
an
oftrepeatable
one
would
recommend
to
fans
of
weizenbocks
o
this
beer
does
a
very
good
job
managing
to
hide
its
alcohol
from
the
taste
it
is
a
very
tasty
weizenbock
o
a
nice
malty
weizenbock
for
sure
the
highlight
here
is
all
of
the
dark
fruit
flavors
really
bright
bold
and
tasty
great
sweetness
and
smoothness
too
drinkability
is
high
light
signs
of
oxidation
in
the
finish
or
just
some
odd
flavors
but
it
doesnt
detract
too
much
overall
this
beer
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
and
its
probably
best
if
you
have
someone
to
share
it
with
an
entire
650ml
bottle
is
not
for
everyone
i
did
not
enjoy
it
but
you
well
might
reddish
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
a
short
cap
of
fine
beige
bubbles
banana
and
cotton
candy
aroma
caramel
grain
and
dried
fruit
pretty
much
the
same
in
the
flavour
grain
and
banana
with
dried
fruit
and
caramel
sweetness
faint
roasted
character
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmthflavour
in
the
finish
a
bit
cleaner
than
i
expected
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
i
liked
it
well
balanced
for
a
big
beer
a
nice
brown
color
with
a
head
that
dissipated
quickly
i
smell
something
i
think
fruit
like
fig
the
taste
is
rich
fruit
a
little
malt
i
dont
notice
any
hops
which
is
ok
instead
i
get
a
little
spiciness
though
i
cant
pin
down
the
spice
i
dont
pick
up
anything
id
associate
with
wheat
the
fruit
flavors
dominate
overall
its
a
tasty
beer
overall
very
doppelbockish
to
my
tastes
at
the
start
turning
more
into
a
sweet
weizenbock
as
it
warms
some
more
overall
not
a
bad
sample
of
a
weizenbock
far
from
the
best
on
my
opinion
aventinus
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
a
rich
drink
it
is
like
sipping
a
fine
single
malt
carbonation
is
really
missing
here
overall
pleasant
and
warm
flavours
interesting
if
not
of
incredible
variety
but
the
sweetness
is
a
little
too
much
and
needs
to
be
cut
by
something
more
carbonation
might
even
help
definitely
worth
a
try
but
maybe
not
a
return
visit
light
to
medium
body
slightly
syrupy
low
carbonation
o
the
complexity
that
the
nose
offered
was
nowhere
to
be
found
upon
tasting
curious
lack
of
carbonation
a
decent
weizenbock
maybe
time
just
wasnt
as
kind
to
it
as
it
should
have
been
bottle
pours
a
hazy
and
oily
amber
with
decent
head
its
an
attractive
auburn
colour
when
held
up
to
the
light
yeastforward
aroma
has
wine
tones
as
well
as
caramelized
grains
the
flavour
is
well
balanced
with
good
depth
including
some
light
barrel
tones
it
actually
reminds
me
of
a
port
the
11
abv
is
well
hidden
until
the
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
no
chefs
palate
could
ever
conceive
of
a
more
diverse
beer
than
a
weizenbock
arguably
the
strongest
most
fruity
spicy
style
in
the
world
for
such
a
heavyduty
ale
this
trois
mousquetaires
beer
has
a
significant
claim
to
the
cellar
its
the
kind
of
offering
you
can
sit
on
for
as
long
as
you
like
until
youre
fully
prepared
for
its
thundering
forcible
presence
a
ruby
red
pour
a
very
low
if
not
faint
in
hops
malty
and
sugary
this
is
and
this
very
much
masks
the
abv
content
of
the
brew
apricot
and
dates
caramel
grainy
this
is
a
tick
taste
the
surprising
thing
about
this
brew
it
is
strong
surgery
in
taste
the
time
at
which
it
leaves
the
palette
is
a
snap
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
recommend
only
a
medium
chill
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
foamy
orangekhaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
and
a
variety
of
dark
fruits
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
distinct
grape
juice
flavor
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
if
i
had
aged
it
for
a
few
years
and
it
had
gone
bad
i
probably
wouldnt
review
it
but
this
one
was
bottled
on
oct
15th
2012
and
it
already
turned
bad
normally
strong
ales
like
this
can
keep
for
a
few
years
id
expect
better
this
is
a
passable
weizonbock
at
best
too
sweet
for
me
also
the
alcohol
could
be
better
hidden
or
reduced
more
realistically
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
not
really
my
favorite
too
sweet
and
probably
could
do
with
some
cellaring
750ml
bottle
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
thats
clear
with
no
head
at
all
really
tastes
of
dark
fruits
with
slight
caramal
and
a
light
toffee
finish
the
big
alcohol
is
there
in
body
but
not
in
taste
it
is
a
sipper
though
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
but
i
dont
see
anything
wheat
ale
about
it
o
a
delicious
example
of
the
style
loads
of
flavour
and
well
worth
seeking
out
ill
be
aging
a
bottle
for
sure
but
this
stuff
is
dangerously
drinkable
at
10
5
m
the
best
part
of
it
medium
density
good
carbonation
as
it
warms
it
gets
a
little
thinner

the
highlights
for
me

this
last

its
a
well
made
weizenbockjust
plan
on
drinking
this
and
not
anything
else
overall
tastes
fairly
good
but
only
for
so
long
not
what
i
expected
although
i
am
not
upset
mouthfeel
is
much
thinner
than
the
head
lead
me
to
believe
i
was
hoping
for
a
thick
monster
and
got
a
medium
kitten
o
this
was
very
difficult
to
drink
the

made

is
definitely

on
it
to
see
if
it
rounds
out
some
of
the
rougher
edges
i
think
i
like
this
beer
and
i
note
that
this
is
a
newer
vintage
than
loaded
into
ba
at
10

the
aroma
is
fairly
enticing
and
the
flavour
isnt
bad
but
the
tartness
detracts
just
a
touch
for
me
good
but
not
great
overall
another
beer
that
is
probably
best
enjoyed
with
someone
else
i
really
do
wish
this
brewer
put
some
of
their
high
end
beers
into
smaller
formats
regardless
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
am
rarely
disappointed
by
les
trois
mousquetaires
this
beer
looks
very
nice
but
overall
its
a
classic
case
of
the
quebec
sweet
tooth
much
to
much
sugar
needs
to
be
better
balanced
the
heat
definitely
pervades
this
beer
however
it
mostly
hangs
somewhat
malevolently
in
the
background
the
rest
is
a
big
sweet

it
sure
is
making

say
that
the
alcohol
works
with
the
beer
and
not
against
it
it
is
masked
and
balanced
nicely
with
fruity
sweetness
and
heavy
malt
character
i
wouldnt
drink
it
every
day
maybe
every
other
day
this
was
the
2010
version
i
think
id
only
be
interested
in
drinking
this
one
again
as
an
apertif
a
few
ounces
with
dessert
or
something
like
that
to
open
a
750ml
of
this
by
yourself
is
just
stupid
buy
one
of
these
stash
it
away
for
a
couple
years
and
pull
it
out
at
a
dinner
party
to
split
amongst
a
table
of
people
that
seems
to
be
what
would
best
suit
this
brew
im
going
to
have
to
drain
pour
some
of
this
its
too
intense
to
finish
alone
d
a
really
big
weizenbock
that
hits
the
style
very
well
too
high
in
alcohol
to
be
a
regular
drinker
but
a
very
nice
sipping
beer
on
a
nice
evening
on
the
deck
d
its
a
big
one
like
a
lighter
version
of
a
dark
barley
wine
wonderful
winter
warmer
they
say
on
the
bottle
its
a
winter
beer
i
couldnt
agree
more
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
just
wasnt
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
in
the
style
the
weizen
characteristics
didnt
come
though
enough
for
me
thanks
bn

d
a
powerhouse
of

complex

i
would
be
able
to
drink
frequently
i
would
recommend
this
beer
3

overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
to
medium
thick
the
finish
on
the
beer
is
medium
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
slightly
astringent
and
carbonated
i
think
that
this
beer
is
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
aging
this
beer
would
definetely
help
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
weizenbock
despite
the
offputting
aroma
the
beer
grows
on
you
pretty
quickly
its
a
decent
enough
beer
doubt
id
grab
another
poured
a
medium
and
cloudy
golden
color
with
an
averaged
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
some
earthiness
toffee
and
light
chocolate
tastes
of
caramel
toffee
and
some
earthywheatiness
there
was
also
some
lighter
fruitiness
medium
bitter
finish
pours
a
nice
colour
with
a
moderate
head
the
aroma
draw
you
in
of
wheat
dark
fruit
some
chocolate
the
taste
is
a
good
full
carmel
mouthfeel
its
rich
nails
the
style
but
must
it
be
at
10
a
tad
of
sourness
in
some
sips
some
sips
with
bitterness
too
mahogany
body
with
hints
of
ruby
small
beige
cap
citrus
oak
bourbon
vanilla
caramel
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
moderate
sweetness
pretty
good
the
bourbon
really
dominates
and
i
would
have
liked
to
have
experienced
more
of
the
bock
but
still
a
very
good
drink
taste
more
vanilla
and
cherry
caramel
and
toffee
and
the
sharp
twang
of
alcohol
just
below
the
sweet
wheat
flavors
of
the
weizenbock
start
to
shine
its
a
lovely
marriage
you
never
forget
for
a
second
that
bourbon
is
involved
here
but
the
base
beer
is
both
fullbodied
enough
to
hold
its
own
against
the
barrel
effects
yet
still
show
off
its
own
character
i
know
i
said
the
opposite
when
speaking
of
the
aroma
but
thats
just
how
it
went
a
delicious
beer
that
sent
me
to
bed
peacefully
buffalo
bock
pours
a
redish
like
color
with
a
nice
large
white
head
there
are
strong
alchool
and
wood
like
aromas
the
taste
is
much
the
same
rather
boozy
strong
wood
like
flavors
and
a
profound
sourness
full
flavors
but
the
more
i
drank
the
less
i
wanted
this
overall
i
found
this
a
tough
beer
to
finish
overall
a
very
good
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
of
a
weizenbock
nice
creamy
notes
of
bourbon
caramel
malt
and
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
a
little
above
average
overall
it
just
didnt
come
together
well
for
me
the
sugary
candied
flavors
and
the
tart
fruits
just
dominated
too
much
for
me
and
made
it
almost
cloyingly
sweet
it
wasnt
awful
but
it
definitely
isnt
one
of
the
better
barrel
aged
beers
ive
had
o
amazing
aromas
flavors
and
feel
id
put
this
closer
to
a
doppelbock
but
there
were
some
weizenbock
elements
like
the
banana
bread
element
i
hope
they
release
this
again
and
in
larger
numbers
pours
a
hazed
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
really
nice
bourbon
aroma
plenty
of
oak
and
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
mild
oxidation
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
maybe
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
sweet
bourbon
vanilla
and
caramel
malts
brown
sugar
oak
and
a
mild
fruitiness
in
the
background
the
barrel
really
drowns
out
most
of
the
base
beer
o
a
nice
treatment
by
th
the
bock
works
well
with
the
whiskey
allowing
both
the
booze
and
base
beer
to
shine
though
its
not
a
mindblowing
experience
that
czar
jack
was
a
couple
years
back
but
its
a
good
beer
muddy
dark
amber
body
capped
by
two
fingers
of
head
solid
head
retention
and
lacing
smells
strongly
of
red
apples
whiskey
and
oak
a
little
yeasty
and
hot
not
overly
complex
palate
has
banana
and
red
apple
oak
and
whiskey
surprisingly
this
has
pretty
harmonious
flavors
and
the
barrel
doesnt
completely
dominate
the
base
beer
body
is
about
medium
decently
hefty
for
the
abv
solid
stuff
for
what
it
is
d
its
a
tad
unexciting
with
a
disproportionate
amount
of
oak
and
barrel
presence
and
not
enough
base
beer
thankfully
it
isnt
very
boozy
so
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
overall
a
solid
brew
i
really
liked
the
nose
on
this
one
kind
of
drank
like
a
fresh
old
ale
but
with
barrel
flavors
very
well
done
good
stuff
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
base
beer
needs
a
little
boost
to
keep
up
with
the
barrel
imo
tastes
and
smells
mostly
like
a
very
nice
watereddown
whiskey
about
75
that
and
25
weizenbock
i
guess
part
of
that
is
that
it
integrates
well
with
the
base
beer
but
id
like
more
of
the
beer
to
come
through
o
kinda
pissed
at
myself
for
only
getting
one
bottle
of
this
i
actually
only
bought
the
bottle
so
i
could
get
the
free
czar
now
i
have
to
discipline
myself
to
hold
onto
it
for
a
while
draft
poured
into
a
small
goblet
slightly
cloudy
carmel
color
with
a
light
tan
head
head
tries
to
stay
but
minimal
head
retention
collars
caramel
apple
slight
spice
vanilla
all
in
the
nose
the
bourbon
is
there
too
but
not
overbearing
sweet
caramel
not
transitions
to
a
slightly
hot
booze
note
but
doesnt
overpower
that
much
will
be
nice
to
see
this
settle
in
the
bottle
for
a
while
and
smooth
out
this
was
my
least
anticipated
barrel
release
from
town
hall
and
im
really
surprised
how
well
i
like
it
medium
mouthfeel
ultimately
i
care
about
the
taste
of
the
beer
im
a
bourbon
lover
and
i
love
the
notes
that
come
through
from
the
eagle
rare
barrel
who
would
have
thought
that
a
weizenbock
would
age
so
well
in
a
bourbon
barrel
but
on
second
thought
the
sweetness
of
the
fruits
present
in
a
good
weizenbock
meld
perfectly
w
the
bourbon
adding
that
brown
sugar
booze
taste
wonderful
this
was
the
beer
i
was
least
looking
forward
to
during
2012
barrelaged
week
its
simply
marvelous
wish
theyd
have
had
the
base
weizenbock
on
to
compare
it
against
they
did
earlier
this
week
that
would
have
been
fun
excellent
beer
sorry
i
didnt
capture
a
bottle
of
this
for
myself
slightly
boozy
in
a
very
good
way
the
barrel
character
shines
especially
at
slightly
colder
temperature
low
carbonation
medium
body
and
silky
feel
with
a
clean
finish
an
example
of
barrel
aging
done
right
this
is
very
nice
beer
sweet
and
boozy
it
is
wonderful
if
you
like
a
hotter
feeling
beer
and
for
me
i
love
the
bourbon
in
this
is
does
lose
some
of
the
traditional
fastest
with
this
style
but
man
is
it
a
beautiful
finished
product
nice
dunkel
a
little
more
rugged
than
id
expected
then
again
that
nose
sent
me
through
the
clouds
3
75
overall
this
is
a
great
weizenbock
sweeter
and
fuller
than
they
typical
version
of
the
style
but
damn
delicious
pennsylvania
brewing
companys
weizenbock
is
a
beer
that
only
a
beer
geek
could
love
it
is
tremendously
bitter
and
strong
and
spicy
and
malty
and
fruity
all
at
once
put
another
way
its
got
more
hops
alcohol
phenols
grain
and
esters
than
most
people
can
handle
proceed
with
a
full
stomach
a
ready
palate
and
just
maybe
a
couple
friends
pours
a
rich
brown
with
a
decent
off
white
foam
forming
in
the
aroma
sugary
malts
and
a
whiff
of
alcohol
flavor
is
dominated
by
sweet
malts
some
honey
baked
bread
and
alittle
alcohol
heat
wheat
elements
with
faint
banana
little
hop
presence
leaving
the
finish
sweet
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
alittle
chewey
overall
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
would
have
it
again
but
could
stand
to
use
alittle
more
balance
m
what
a
weizenbock
should
be
the
spiciness
and
strong
wheat
body
conspire
to
make
a
delicious
ale
on
tap
the
fullness
is
very
nice
overall
probably
the
sweetest
weizenbock
i
have
ever
had
but
that
is
fine
with
me
because
i
am
a
malthead
feels
creamy
up
front
with
enough
hops
in
the
finish
malty
sweet
overriped
bananas
yeasty
flavors
dry
on
the
tongue
a
little
bit
of
the
alcohol
shows
medium
mouthfeel
on
the
delicate
side
enjoyed
this
one
o
this
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
for
the
style
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
dtoo
sweet
no
balance
very
simple
lots
of
flaws
i
would
never
purchase
it
again
yes
it
has
a
high
alcohol
content
but
you
cannot
taste
it
so
it
is
pretty
drinkable
you
could
throw
them
down
and
just
suddenly
pass
out
overall
a
very
good
beer
its
balanced
and
not
too
strong
drinkability
the
abv
has
some
legs
but
the
mouthfeel
is
terrific
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
nice
pale
wheat
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
wonderful
yeasty
aroma
its
quite
fruity
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
dry
roasted
malt
flavor
with
some
caramel
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
yeast
adds
a
nice
level
of
complexity
infusing
it
with
dark
fruit
esters
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
terrific
beer
the
malt
bill
is
outstanding
as
well
as
the
character
the
yeast
provides
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
a
big
beige
head
that
left
spots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
dark
fruits
and
spiced
wheat
malt
good
tasting
brew
a
blend
of
sweet
fruit
flavors
and
wheat
beer
spices
a
full
bodied
beer
that
is
creamy
smooth
and
goes
down
really
easy
penn
weizenbock
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
twenty
five
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
banana
in
it
the
flavor
is
typical
of
a
weinzenbock
a
bit
fruity
some
bubblegum
lots
of
banana
and
some
clove
pretty
enjoyable
definitely
worth
a
try
ontap
at
flying

the

fire
sale
no
less
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
an
extremely
murky
brown
almost
like
a
glass
of
muddy
water
aroma
is
loads
of
wheat
brown
malt
spices
and
a
touch
of
molasses
taste
is
everything
i
expect
for
the
style
crisp
malt
wheat
clove
and
spice
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
the
alcohol
fairly
well
hidden
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
of
the
best
american
brewed
weizenbocks
ive
had
and
certainly
the
best
beer
from
penn
ive
had
so
far
out
of
a
750ml
capped
bottle
pours
a
murky
mud
puddle
brown
color
with
an
average
tan
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
with
clove
and
pepper
and
an
almost
meatysoy
sauce
smell
from
the
malt
this
is
definitely
more
bock
than
weizen
but
thats
ok
very
big
meaty
malt
presence
soy
sauce
wet
wood
this
is
somewhat
cut
by
the
wheat
malt
but
not
really
some
of
the
weizen
characteristics
pop
through
but
not
much
a
nice
full
body
not
quite
chewy
lots
of
carbonation
to
offset
the
malt
makes
this
easier
to
drink
sweet
yet
saviory
a
different
angle
for
a
weizen
bock
more
bock
centric
i
prefer
my
weizen
bocks
to
be
more
hefe
like
but
this
still
has
really
good
flavors
and
aroma
worth
picking
up
drinkability
a
solid
weizenbock
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
though
it
is
indeed
up
there
though
not
necessarily
for
the
style
which
enhances
the
drinkability
and
its
complex
enough
brew
that
its
an
interesting
drink
give
it
a
shot
if
you
run
across
it
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
but
it
was
still
pretty
good
thanks
again
for
the
freebie
jason
d
very
drinkable
on
a
day
with
a
current
temp
of
20f
750
ml
bottle
nose
has
some
nice
elements
to
it
with
notes
of
honey
grapes
and
wheat
malts
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
clove
and
other
yeast
components
flavor
is
authentic
and
has
nice
purity
but
is
a
bit
cloying
and
doesnt
have
the
fullness
in
the
mouth
id
like
dvery
nice
example
of
a
weizenbock
however
im
not
sure
i
could
have
taken
on
more
than
one
bottle
d
i
like
this
brewbut
honestly
think
that
i
should
have
chosen
a
different
glass
its
a
very
good
solid
weizenbockthat
confuses
me
even
more
on
what
the
typical
style
profile
is
for
this
beer
definately
worth
a
try
d
very
nice
weizenbock
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
it
is
a
great
one
to
share
since
its
a
750ml
great
example
of
the
style
sampled
this
at
the
south
philly
tap
rooms
wheat
beer
fest
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
to
brown
color
with
a
decent
off
whitebrown
head
up
front
youd
think
this
beer
would
be
a
bit
heavier
cuz
of
the
color
and
the
abv
but
thats
not
the
case
comes
through
nice
and
refreshing
which
youd
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
has
a
nice
spicy
finish
to
it
which
caught
me
a
little
off
guard
but
was
a
positive
didnt
really
pull
to
much
of
a
hop
flavor
upfront
or
at
the
tailend
for
the
abv
you
by
far
get
your
moneys
worth
but
becareful
these
go
down
a
lot
easier
than
a
beer
of
this
stature
should
i
am
very
impressed
with
the
four
bocks
and
regular
weizenother
stuff
ive
had
from
penn
brewing
all
of
them
have
been
very
authentically
germantasting
very
nice
job
guys
in
a
world
of
super
hoppy
brews
which
i
do
like
penn
brewing
might
just
be
an
underappreciated
brewery
hey
penn
brewing
is
there
any
chance
of
you
making
a
malty
darkish
eisbock
in
the
future
i
would
love
to
try
one
from
you
i
bet
you
would
hit
that
one
out
of
the
ballpark
just
make
sure
you
keep
sending
your
special
brews
to
florida
so
i
can
buy
them
when
im
down
there
fairly
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
as
far
as
weizenbocks
go
this
is
a
good
one
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
schneider
weisse
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
the
aroma
features
a
lot
of
banana
and
clove
wheat
sweet
caramel
and
yeast
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
had
a
beer
that
smells
so
close
to
actual
banana
flavors
as
this
one
the
taste
is
sweet
with
banana
and
clove
along
with
some
spices
and
some
hops
in
the
finish
i
am
really
digging
this
beer
pennsylvania
brewing
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
with
some
of
their
spot
on
interpretations
of
classic
german
styles
overall
pennsylvania
weizenbock
is
a
world
class
beer
that
is
highly
recommended
still
there
are
wonderful
dark
fruity
malt
flavors
mixed
with
a
banana
clove
blend
the
aroma
is
rich
with
the
malt
and
yeast
character
and
the
body
isnt
too
thick
to
stop
it
from
being
an
easydrinking
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
like
wheat
beers
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
good
little
diamond
in
my
backyard
so
to
speak
for
me
its
not
a
session
beer
but
it
is
one
you
should
seek
out
amber
coloured
with
a
reddish
tint
and
slight
haze
the
beige
head
was
thick
and
creamy
had
great
retention
and
produced
some
sticky
lacing
nice
aroma
lemon
and
clove
bananas
quite
malty
with
grapefruit
and
tropical
fruit
too
same
in
the
flavour
for
the
most
part
but
with
the
cloves
grapefruit
and
malt
more
pronounced
solid
bitterness
also
though
it
was
balanced
nicely
and
stayed
in
the
background
medium
to
full
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
dryness
on
the
palate
the
flavour
combination
seemed
a
little
strange
not
your
standard
weizenbock
but
it
worked
pretty
well
to
make
for
an
interesting
pint
d
excellent
and
will
pull
for
this
one
anytime
a
great
creation
i
love
the
specialty
brews
penn
has
been
releasing
lately
i
cant
wait
to
try
alter
ego
penn
brewery
makes
me
proud
to
be
from
the
burgh
i
had
this
on
tap
at
cb
six
in
manhattan
it
was
dark
brown
red
color
hazy
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
the
aroma
was
perfect
fruity
and
estery
bananas
and
cloves
the
taste
was
the
same
actually
very
sweet
with
some
plums
and
raisins
as
well
this
is
a
really
great
weizenbock
id
like
to
see
it
in
bottles
d
starts
out
pretty
good
and
gets
better
as
it
goes
very
enjoyable
worth
seeking
out
this
is
probably
the
finest
weizenbock
i
have
yet
to
drink
its
taste
and
smeel
match
the
profile
perfectly
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
and
drinkability
is
excellent
great
job
i
love
penn
its
the
first
micro
from
the
burgh
anyone
in
my
parts
got
their
hands
on
first
going
back
to
the
days
when
i
felt
penn
pilsner
was
nectar
of
the
gods
as
the
years
go
by
and
you
find
yourself
trying
more
micros
outside
of
the
area
and
not
visiting
penn
brewing
or
drinking
their
beer
as
often
as
you
once
had
they
do
something
a
little
past
due
thats
innovation
i
love
the
vienna
style
penn
pils
the
helles
penn
gold
the
german
pils
kaiser
pils
the
dunkel
penn
dark
the
hefe
penn
weizen
the
marzen
and
ofest
they
just
brew
good
beer
and
drinking
beer
at
that
so
why
didnt
they
begin
this
experimentation
stage
of
bigger
beers
other
than
the
seasonal
penn
maibock
i
cant
answer
that
question
thank
god
they
did
because
ive
been
drinking
the
weizenbock
since
its
been
released
at
fatheads
bocktown
smokin
joes
and
ds
its
great
appears
a
clouded
plum
ruddy
brown
completely
opaque
the
caked
yeast
floating
in
a
suspension
is
a
site
to
see
its
complemented
by
a
large
tan
head
leaving
bands
of
thick
lacing
all
around
my
pint
glass
aroma
has
deep
spiced
banana
and
clove
with
caramel
malts
and
sweet
raisin
apple
fruit
esters
and
evident
alcohol
in
there
flavor
has
sweet
over
ripened
fruit
plums
raisins
sticky
caramelized
banana
and
clove
and
mild
vanilla
traces
doughy
with
the
bread
mixture
definitely
like
a
smoothie
in
most
regards
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
creamy
textured
somewhat
airy
with
moderate
effervescent
carbonation
spices
tend
to
stay
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
sessionable
if
you
dont
believe
me
come
to
bocktown
when
a
group
like
trash
aka
three
rivers
alliance
of
serious
homebrewers
gets
together
for
one
of
their
meetings
they
definitely
felt
penn
weizenbock
was
sessionable
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
chewy
estery
and
yeasty
in
the
mouth
there
is
a
bit
of
astringency
found
in
there
that
clings
to
the
cheeks
it
finishes
spicy
and
dry
drinkability
this
beer
definitely
hides
its
strength
quite
well
yummy
d
another
winner
from
penn
even
when
they
decide
to
go
big
this
is
a
tasty
bock
that
leans
towards
a
maibock
very
nice
and
tasty
weizenbock
lots
of
good
flavor
in
this
one
and
goes
down
very
easy
definitely
worth
trying
this
one
and
i
hope
to
have
it
again
as
a
big
fan
of
the
weizenbock
style
i
was
pleased
to
see
them
available
from
local
brewers
poured
a
cloudy
medium
brown
with
a
moderate
head
aroma
of
caramel
and
bananas
with
some
ripe
fruit
taste
was
fruit
and
spice
with
a
pleasant
bitter
hop
finish
very
smooth
and
drinkable
not
as
balanced
or
explosive
as
the
bavarian
originals
which
i
love
but
an
interesting
us
version
which
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
o
not
bad
but
there
are
better
weizenbocks
to
be
had
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
muddy
looking
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
are
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
gives
off
the
yeasty
bread
aromas
along
with
the
mixture
of
clove
and
banana
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
similar
to
the
smell
the
clove
and
banana
with
a
touch
of
cirtus
and
wheat
bread
all
blend
together
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
decent
carbonation
overall
its
a
good
attempt
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
i
feel
there
are
better
choices
out
there
but
this
one
isnt
terrible
overall
a
tasty
wellbrewed
and
very
drinkable
weizenbock
this
is
a
solid
brew
nice
drinkability
and
a
very
well
hidden
alcohol
presence
my
first
brew
from
abc
good
stuff
poured
from
the
22oz
into
my
newcastle
brown
schooner
copper
color
with
not
much
head
to
speak
of
minimal
lacing
nice
sweet
smell
taste
was
more
malt
than
hops
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
easy
drinking
overall
i
liked
it
but
it
seemed
basic
not
bad
at
all
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
deep
amber
in
color
a
caramelclove
aroma
with
a
subtle
sweetness
rich
creamy
mouthfeel
sweet
upfront
followed
by
a
cohesive
yeast
and
malt
richness
through
the
middle
finishes
up
with
a
return
of
the
sweetness
but
milder
as
it
is
tempered
by
molasses
overall
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
for
a
higher
abv
beer
and
a
good
representative
of
the
style
poured
into
an
oversized
mug
a
cloudy
amber
brown
with
a
slight
thin
layer
of
tanned
head
nose
is
yeasty
little
bit
of
clove
and
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
sweet
upfront
with
yeast
and
spice
throughout
most
of
the
body
and
into
the
finish
somewhat
crisp
in
the
finish
with
mild
hop
bitterness
highly
carbonated
with
a
medium
feel
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
exciting
either
1210
nice
this
is
one
of
the
better
seasonals
they
do
here
during
the
year
and
its
a
good
choice
to
put
on
around
the
holidays
lots
of
sweetness
roast
spice
and
fruit
make
this
a
great
festive
quaff
d
drinkable
i
would
enjoy
this
with
food
and
when
i
got
my
food
with
about
13
of
the
glass
left
the
enjoyment
went
up
i
felt
my
stomach
filling
before
then
though
and
i
feel
like
i
couldnt
stomach
a
bunch
of
these
d
im
glad
they
still
had
this
on
tap
ill
be
making
it
back
next
winter
to
get
another
pint
of
two
d
satisfying
not
boring
with
alcohol
well
hidden
good
from
start
to
finish
d
one
of
the
better
weizenbocks
i
have
had
i
believe
it
is
a
seasonal
at
abc
a
very
good
beer
with
a
higher
abv
notes
from
22107
d
very
east
to
drink
and
incredibly
tasty
dnot
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
not
very
complex
very
straight
forward
probably
better
when
its
summer
d
alcohol
remains
wellhidden
in
this
brew
nice
blend
of
spicy
and
sweet
flavors
with
a
full
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
brew
from
abc
one
of
their
best
overall
i
think
this
is
a
solid
sweet
refreshing
brew
that
i
could
drink
more
of
i
really
liked
it
better
on
tap
though
it
seems
to
have
lost
something
by
the
next
day
in
the
growler
quite
cloudy
hazy
caramel
colour
with
a
fine
thin
head
some
lacing
decent
retention
yeasty
bready
aroma
with
plenty
of
malt
fruity
notes
with
a
bit
of
banana
mild
bitterness
malty
caramel
fruity
esters
with
some
clove
spiciness
in
the
finish
medium
to
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
fine
bubbles
providing
a
creamy
texture
not
bad
overall
with
nothing
really
out
of
place
a
solid
beer
the
beer
was
served
with
amberbrown
body
and
a
slight
tan
head
that
didnt
last
all
that
long
the
nose
is
slighty
sweet
caramel
and
a
touch
of
spice
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
caramel
sweetness
and
spicey
and
also
slighty
fruity
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
the
body
is
medium
easy
to
drink
cheers
this
was
brought
to
me
with
a
thin
lighttan
head
with
little
retention
quickly
reducing
to
wisps
the
nose
was
fruity
and
yeasty
with
a
prevalence
of
banana
esters
but
underlain
with
clove
the
color
was
a
very
cloudy
browninshcopper
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
banana
was
the
primary
flavor
on
the
palate
the
finish
had
a
spicy
explosiveness
which
was
undoubtedly
yeastdriven
it
was
not
bad
but
just
not
my
style
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
weizenbock
my
first
and
plan
on
trying
many
many
more
this
was
also
my
first
appalachian
brew
and
i
will
definetly
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
to
come
this
was
a
fantastic
winter
brew
that
was
not
too
harsh
so
even
my
wife
enjoyed
this
brew
well
done
on
tap
at
harrisburg
abc
restaurant
arrived
in
pint
glass
creamy
browncaramel
in
color
with
a
little
tan
head
smells
of
caramel
clove
wheat
and
a
hint
of
banana
very
rich
taste
lots
of
clove
with
very
little
alcohol
taste
a
very
smooth
beer
with
a
good
solid
body
highly
drinkable
d
the
drinkability
is
decent
a
relatively
higher
abv
numbs
the
tongue
if
kept
in
the
mouth
too
long
but
the
flavors
are
crisp
and
intense
it
didnt
start
as
much
to
look
at
but
that
was
the
only
real
downside
its
a
safe
rendition
of
the
style
but
well
done
crisp
and
enjoyable
the
alcohol
made
itself
scarce
in
the
flavor
but
it
warmed
nicely
which
at
least
lent
it
some
cautionary
note
it
drank
easy
and
smooth
and
while
not
remarkable
it
is
very
solid
id
wager
this
would
be
a
dependable
beer
to
choose
for
those
times
when
a
hankering
for
the
style
is
an
issue
it
would
not
be
a
bad
way
to
slake
that
desire
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
for
this
medium
bodied
brew
very
easy
to
drink
almost
deceptively
so
if
you
dont
watch
yourself
the
abv
sneaks
up
and
smacks
you
im
not
a
big
fan
on
weizenbocks
so
thats
a
good
reason
why
i
didnt
like
this
this
beer
has
a
great
head
about
it
and
has
a
brown
color
to
it
it
actually
looks
like
an
ipa
the
aroma
is
nice
healthy
and
strong
full
of
hop
flavor
and
as
for
the
malt
when
you
drink
this
you
know
its
a
weizen
its
hard
to
judge
this
not
liking
weizens
but
knowing
that
all
the
styles
that
i
do
like
they
hit
it
right
on
the
money
ill
have
to
say
assume
that
their
weizenbock
is
done
well
the
volks
weizen
or
as
they
call
it
the
peoples
beer
combines
the
strong
malty
component
of
a
bock
and
the
tangyness
of
a
hefe
weizen
this
beer
tastes
very
closely
to
their
abbey
roade
belgian
ale
and
is
a
specialty
that
is
servered
in
the
month
of
december
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
boldness
on
this
brew
but
overall
it
is
very
satisfying
just
not
spectacular
got
a
growler
from
the
drafting
room
in
springhouse
and
what
a
nice
beer
this
ispours
a
hazy
medium
brown
almost
tealike
looking
with
a
nice
big
fluffy
head
that
leaves
some
real
nice
lacing
a
nice
green
apple
aroma
along
with
a
little
caramel
sweetnessvery
appetizing
taste
has
spicey
cloviness
to
it
along
with
some
tart
apple
flavors
even
a
slight
nutty
tinge
to
it
i
dont
know
much
about
this
brewer
but
if
all
their
beer
are
of
this
quality
i
will
be
seeking
these
out
it
pours
into
the
glass
a
dark
amber
ruby
color
there
is
no
head
when
it
came
to
the
table
just
a
thin
beige
covering
no
lace
is
present
the
aroma
is
of
strong
malt
some
yeast
spicy
and
some
fruit
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
bock
it
is
tangy
fruityspicy
and
malty
there
are
some
hints
of
yeast
that
hit
the
back
and
sort
of
linger
for
a
second
this
is
a
strong
beer
but
very
smooth
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
year
long
and
wish
that
it
were
available

serving
type

poured
into

with

the
head
dissipates
at
a
moderate
pace
the
aroma
reflects
expected
weizenbock
notes
i
get
some
of
of
those
banana
and
clove
smells
along
with
the
sweet
and
bready
malt
aromas
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
wheat
and
barley
malt
offer
some
bready
sweetness
and
those
banana
and
clove
flavors
come
out
as
well
the

is
wellhidden
in
the
flavor
i
pick
up
some
of
that
bubblegum
flavor
as
well
theres
some
mild
spiciness
as
well
the
body
is
medium
with
high
carbonation
the
finish
is

clean
the

is

not

either
just
dirty
the
aroma
is
big
on
banana
some
clove
and
green
apple
round
out
the
smell
the
taste
is
of
banana
bread
or
overripe
bananas
nice
bready
wheat
malt
the
malt
plays
nicely
with
the
yeasty

has
a
nice
spicy
flavor
without
the
drying
wheat
characteristic
moderate
to
full
body
with
fizzy
carbonation
yet
it
has
a
smooth
feel
nice
yeasty
flavors
not
very
bockish
the
yeast
shines
through
in
this
one
a
good
amped
up
hefe
this
is
kind
of
oily
and
slick
and
seems
to
be
medium

are

also
a

short
all
around
overall
impression
nice
but
a
bit
soda
poppy
drinkability
its
hard
to
find
a
good
weizenbock
make
that
any
weizenbock
americans
need
to
take
a
stab
at
this
style
more
often
anyway
if
aventinus
was
not
at
hand
this
would
probably
be
my
go
to
per
style
quite
good
d
easy
to
drink
at
7
abv
its
right
at
the
small
limit
of
the
style
and
the
lightest
weizenbock
ive
tried
so
far
this
is
not
to
say
anything
negative
but
the
beer
is
easier
to
drink
but
less
complex
than
other
weizenbocks
pours
the
color
of
unfiltered
apple
juice
with
a
big
fluffy
beige
head
that
displays
good
retention
banana
smoothie
aroma
with
some
vanilla
and
sweet
cream
also
light
clove
and
apple
flavor
is
basically
identical
but
with
a
slight
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
body
is
creamy
but
light
carbonation
is
lively
very
drinkable
a
solid
weizenbock
this
will
be
added
to
my
change
up
of
beers
in
my
stash
never
noticed
this
before
i
dont
think
ill
be
able
to
age
this
one
its
to
good
all
around
ive
had
better
at
a
brewpub
on
tap
that
folded
because
of
location
and
im
not
sure
where
the
brewer
is
now
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
believe
there
are
better
options
yet
out
there
i
e
aventinus
and
schneider
d
i
feel
one
is
just
enough
it
was
somewhat
harder
to
down
than
other
weizenbocks
ive
enjoyed
perhaps
this
was
because
i
prefer
darker
wheat
beers
or
that
this
hopf
had
a
slight
alcohol
taste
to
it
d
this
is
a
good
wheat
beer
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
wheats
with
a
very
strong
banana
flavor
but
this
one
is
very
nice
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orangebrown
color
into
my
weizen
glass
creating
a
huge
gush
of
foam
on
top
befoe
it
drops
to
a
bubbly
head
then
to
nothing
retention
is
poor
on
this
one
much
of
the
aroma
is
compounded
by
a
simple
mixture
of
cider
and
banana
taste
is
similar
as
well
but
with
a
little
touch
of
bubblegum
too
it
tastes
strong
as
a
weizenbock
should
and
it
makes
a
pretty
good
palate
cleanser
it
also
makes
your
head
feel
a
little
lighter
too
so
watch
out
d
pretty
good
it
is
no
aventinus
but
it
is
an
excellent
and
pleasant
choice
for
a
weizenbock
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
for
a
night
or
two
and
not
complain
a
solid
beer
mouthfeel
is
alternately
smooth
and
prickly
due
to
the
levels
of
yeast
and
carbonation
in
the
summer
its
the
most
sessionable
weizenbock
ive
had
recommended
recommended
maybe
not
completely
a
weizenbock
but
its
still
quite
good
d
rich
and
satisfying
the
alcohol
is
never
noticeable
but
then
again
its
only
7
so
it
really
shouldnt
be
slightly
murky
and
orangy
body
with
a
sizeable
head
which
i
had
wait
about
five
minutes
for
it
to
go
down
before
my
first
sip
sweet
wheaty
flavor
is
present
but
generally
overwhelmed
by
the
presence
of
alcohol
it
has
a
nice
smooth
finish
leaving
a
pleasant
aftertaste
very
drinkable
but
its
strong
so
if
youre
not
a
big
guy
youll
probably
feel
a
buzz
pretty
quick
drinkability

very
drinkable
you
wont
find
to
many
beer
drinkers
who
wont
like
this
one
drinkabilityoverall
certainly
a
tightly
made
weizenbock
but
uninspiring
overall
especially
in
comparison
to
some
of
the
other
weve
recently
tried
in
the
style
not
all
wiezenbocks
are
equal
lucky
thing
that
aventinus
is
the
easy
one
to
find
everywhere

of

this

comes
in

out
of

still
its
a
beer
that
is

ill

these
for

for

as
indeed
did
all
three
of
the
hopfs
i
picked
up
recently
another
tasty
brew
from
weissbierbrauerei
hopf
a
fine
weizenbock
nice
drinkable
brew
almost
a
dessert
beer
this
my
first
beer
entry
in
this
log
but
i
am
a
seasoned
beer
drinker
except
for
german
beers
which
i
why
i
wanted
to
start
with
this
one
there
are
those
beers
that
let
you
taste
them
before
you
take
a
sip
this
one
had
a
great
nose
of
bananas
and
warm
bread
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
it
is
refreshing
and
flavorfulgreat
with
thanksgiving
leftovers
it
also
has
a
nice
warming
effect
on
the
upper
chestperfect
for
a
rainy
day
as
it
warms
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
but
a
nice
beer
not
sure
what
appearance
means
so
that
is
tough
to
rate
when
poured
the
color
was
a
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
medium
amout
of
foam
and
not
much
lace
the
smell
of
spicy
cloves
filled
the
nose
along
with
a
wheat
aroma
the
taste
was
of
wheat
and
cloves
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
kind
of
dry
on
the
palate
a
very
tasty
brew
very
easy
to
drink
almost
too
easy
as
it
disappeared
so
fast
the

blindsided
me
a

the

very
well
nice

mouthfeel
is

is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
after
being
disappointed
with
my
first
hopf
brew
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
bock
it
pours
golden
brown
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
fades
but
leaves
bubbles
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
nice
combination
of
fruit
and
spice
with
just
a
hint
of
black
licorice
the
taste
is
certainly
on
the
mild
side
but
its
by
no
means
bland
fruit
and
spice
also
dominate
the
taste
and
the
7
alcohol
is
nicely
hidden
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
is
frighteningly
drinkable
a
nice
example
of
the

this
is

a

this

some
cool

dominating

on

a

a
le

shawinigan
handshake
is
damn
tasty
stuff
although
not
exactly
what
i
would
call
a
traditional
weizenbock
the
hop
choice
is
decidedly
north
american
in
flavour
which
causes
this
to
come
across
as
an
ipa
crossed
with
a
weizenbock
hop
heads
like
myself
will
no
doubt
appreciate
the
interplay
although
fans
of
classic
weizenbocks
like
aventinus
or
vitus
may
be
caught
offguard
by
the
astringency
this
is
a
beer
id
certainly
recommend
though
probably
only
to
fans
of
hoppy
brews
in
general
its
a
quirky
wheat
beer
which
given
the
name
and
label
art
isnt
terribly
surprising
a
solid
offering
and
i
am
eager
to
try
more
trou
du
diable
brews
in
the
future
m
medium
body
dry
and
slightly
sticky
moderate
carbonation
a
rather
tasty
weizenbock
bolstered
further
by
the
added
kick
of
the
west
coast
yankee
hops
so
a
beer
is
a
beer
what
kind
of
beer
its
a
beer
a
beer
is
a
beer
and
when
you
have
good
beer
its
because
its
beery
q
e
d
tabernacle
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazed
peachgold
coloring
with
a
frothy
uneven
offwhite
filmy
surface
coating
of
head
aromas
of
banana
bread
cloves
subtle
bubble
gum
sweetness
and
sappy
spruce
tassels
flavors
are
bready
on
the
forward
tongue
with
heavy
clove
spicing
and
spruce
banana
and
orange
fruit
sweetness
blend
together
but
get
outweighed
by
the
initial
flavorings
the
carbonation
in
the
beer
and
the
light
body
results
in
an
almost
astringent
sharp
feeling
on
the
forward
tongue
when
you
drink
there
is
also
an
acidic
characteristic
on
the
initial
taste
that
slowly
calms
as
the
beer
passes
through
the
mouth
seems
lighter
in
mouth
than
what
i
would
expect
for
the
aromas
and
the
flavors
the
aftertaste
is
woody
and
roasted
with
a
hint
of
spicing
that
lingers
on
past
the
quick
effervescent
finish
the
end
of
the
beer
is
almost
astringent
again
as
it
clears
the
palate
decent
flavors
throughout
but
the
body
makes
it
a
tough
one
to
drink
for
me
3
75
d
this
was
tasty
and
something
i
would
pickup
again
likely
not
the
most
complex
weizenbock
but
a
very
well
put
together
offering
that
is
both
fresh
tasting
and
smooth
od
not
too
excited
about
this
one
spice
was
a
bit
much
and
while
it
redeemed
itself
a
bit
later
on
but
i
couldnt
really
get
into
this
too
much
very
simple
stuff
in
my
glass
solidly
crafted
but
i
expected
lots
more
wouldnt
grab
another
a
very
tasty
brew
indeed
a
wheat
beer
with
a
bit
of
american
hops
chinook
in
this
case
though
it
seems
like
an
odd
combination
it
somehow
works
quite
well
o
came
off
as
a
strong

with
a
good
dose
of
hops
quite
drinkable
o
this
stuff
is
incredibly
drinkable
loads
of
flavour
and
i
will
definitely
be
grabbing
more
heres
to
hoping
that
more
of
tdd
brews
are
included
in
the
lcbo
seasonal
releases
because
im
loving
what
theyre
bringing
to
the
table
overall
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
on
based
on
other
reviews
theres
just
a
bit
too
much
of
a
rustyacidicmetallic
flavour
and
scent
in
it
for
me
i
try
not
to
judge
books
by
their
cover
and
if
i
were
to
judge
a
beer
by
its
label
this
one
would
be
one
of
the
best
the
liquid
itself
is
also
quite
nice
and
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
thanks
again
yannick
for
the
want
bottle
at
barhop
a
weizen
bock
is
only
part
of
the
story
fresh
and
well
hopped
banana
and
hops
lots
of
fruitiness
fuller
mouthfeel
lasting
head
and
thick
looking
not
something
to
have
every
night
and
is
a
nice
production
aromas
are
toward
wheat
and
spice
overall
good
stuff
would
certainly
like
to
have
this
again
in
the
nose
it
explode
with
hefeweizen
notes
and
some
hops
that
makes
everything
shine
bananas
with
tropical
fruits
excellent
aroma
taste
is
another
wow
so
tasty
so
good
bananas
and
tropical
fruits
again
brewery
should
make
more
beer
tasting
like
this
and
tdd
should
make
this
one
a
regular
dry
finish
bitter
some
spiciness
in
the
mouth
slightly
effervescent
warmth
this
is
almost
perfect
beer
next
time
i
buy
a
case
of
this
one
overall
a
real
nice
hybrid
of
a
beer
worth
enjoying
but
dont
hang
on
to
it
too
long
as
theres
no
potential
of
aging
that
i
can
see
this
wont
have
me
switching
over
from
weihenstephaner
any
time
soon
but
nevertheless
this
is
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
excellent
example
of
the
style
with
a
bit
more
bite
than
the
german
versions
hits
all
the
right
notes
of
malt
and
spice
highly
recommended
o
an
interesting
concept
trying
to
make
a
hefedipa
blend
but
its
not
as
balanced
as
it
couldshould
be
some
of
the
yeasty
aspects
clash
with
the
higher
abv
and
hoppiness
making
it
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
i
applaud
po
for
the
attempt
because
beers
like
this
are
not
easy
to
pull
off
still
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
an
unusual
combo
of
styles
and
flavors
i
get
to
finish
the
other
half
of
the
bottle
tonight
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
i
rather
enjoy
a
dipa
and
a
hefeweizen
on
their
own
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
one
finger
foamy
white
head
leaves
a
nice
solid
lacing
down
the
glass
after
being
in
the
fridge
for
two
years
much
of
the
hop
profile
is
gone
though
there
is
a
strong
bitterness
left
in
the
finish
some
cloves
and
bananas
up
front
it
has
a
strong
bready
base
with
a
spicy
middle
strong
carbonation
i
bet
this
would
be
really
nice
with
the
full
hop
profile
when
it
was
fresh
im
digging
a
nice
bitter
wheat
beer
on
a
hot
day
recommended
but
be
warned
this
is
one
aggressive
assertive
brew
anything
that
is
8
6
abv
yet
actually
taste
higher
should
be
consumed
in
moderation
o
this
beer
can
be
intense
but
is
something
interesting
to
try
if
you
like
weizenbocks
and
ipas
taste
is
clashing
i
dont
find
the
bananaclove
flavors
to
mesh
well
with
the
firm
bitternesshop
flavors
tastes
more
hoppy
than
anything
and
the
yeast
esters
just
muddle
and
confuse
my
palate
no
bueno
para
mi
o
this
is
a
good
beer
although
only
8
6abv
seems
a
bit
more
potent
i
would
definitely
drink
another
one
of
these
as
i
near
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
give
it
a
good
swirl
to
stir
up
some
of
the
yeast
im
expecting
the
yeast
to
be
a
little
more
appealing
to
my
sweet
hefe
loving
palate
well
it
unfortunately
doesnt
make
the
weiss
principal
any
better
for
me
sorry
overall
a
pretty
cool
beer
its
the
first
hefeweizen
ive
ever
handed
to
my
hophead
friend
that
he
liked
actually
he
loved
it
and
hasnt
stopped
raving
about
it
throughout
the
entire
bottle
although
its
not
my
favorite
brew
i
can
sincerely
appreciate
the
creativity
of
the
weiss
principle
ale
it
really
is
the
international
love
child
of
a
hefeweisse
and
an
american
ipa
as
the
label
states
this
beer
was
terrific
wild
but
terrific
the
description
is
apt
its
a
german
hefe
meets
an
ipa
in
the
nose
a
crazy
combination
of
citrusy
hops
battle
with
the
clovetype
smells
of
hefe
yeast
its
a
wild
combo
the
beer
is
totally
unfiltered
so
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
rich
creamy
and
satisfying
the
hops
and
are
very
prominent
on
the
front
then
the
yeast
flavors
banana
etc
come
out
strong
at
the
end
its
a
roller
coaster
my
only
complaint
is
the
richness
of
the
mouthfeel
i
think
does
interfere
a
bit
with
the
other
flavors
but
otherwise
a
really
fun
beer
decent
beer
but
a
bit
misguided
the
different
aspects
clash
to
much
for
my
liking
interesting
if
nothing
else
dang
this
is
good
beer
maybe
not
the
weizenbock
style
it
says
here
but
its
label
is
spot
on
an
imperial
germanstyle
hefeweisse
at
a
very
good
temperature
it
poured
with
a
grand
offwhite
thick
foamy
frothy
billowy
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
and
some
lace
color
is
a
hazy
apricot
amber
with
particulates
and
a
few
tiny
bubble
trails
aroma
is
yeast
banana
clove
orange
malt
hop
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
with
some
pine
and
grapefruit
along
with
carbonic
tang
body
is
a
little
soft
and
yet
just
right
for
this
hybrid
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
average
length
ending
with
a
little
sweetness
at
very
last
excellent
beer
5
a
bomber
o
i
was
quite
impressed
with
parts
of
this
beer
and
overall
i
still
think
its
a
good
beer
and
worthy
a
try
if
they
could
tone
down
the
feel
of
the
alcohol
and
improve
the
aroma
i
think
this
would
be
one
brilliant
beer
lacking
the
pronounced
wheat
flavor
or
masking
spices
i
usually
find
objectionable
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
usual
weissbier
different
hops
or
less
hops
may
have
saved
this
beer
i
wonder
if
german
brewers
who
attempted
this
kind
of
schtick
centuries
ago
were
punished
imo
many
high
gravity
wheat
beers
are
a
joke
a
corruption
and
a
waste
of
good
ingredients
this
is
one
of
them
at
first
i
could
taste
a
solid
hefe
in
there
and
then
it
was
choked
to
death
by
hops
sugar
and
booze
a
wild
and
interesting
brew
open
your
mind
with
this
one
its
good
id
drink
it
again
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
good
hefes
and
good
ipas
the
sum
of
the
parts
are
probably
better
than
the
whole
taste
has
a
good
carbonation
level
the
aftertaste
is
an
odd
bitterness
the
kind
you
would
get
if
you
ate
the
rind
of
an
orange
light
citrus
presence
that
might
have
been
a
product
of
the
hops
but
the
hops
are
no
longer
a
large
aspect
of
this
beer
p
s
a
lot
of
sediment
at
the
bottom
overall
i
tried
this
acbf
back
in
june
and
finally
have
decided
to
enjoy
it
at
home
i
enjoyed
it
then
and
still
enjoyed
it
now
big
debate
to
get
in
on
draft
or
bottle
who
cares
ill
take
both
interesting
brew
and
an
ambitious
rethinking
of
the
wheat
ale
style
i
have
to
say
that
peak
has
certainly
done
the
job
well
adding
enough
extra
zest
to
make
for
an
intriguing
sipper
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
gold
color
with
a
thick
towering
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
mix
of
hefe
yeast
esters
and
bitter
hop
aroma
its
sweet
and
fruity
with
some
subtle
bananaclove
character
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
good
hefe
flavor
pale
and
wheat
malts
fruity
yeast
esters
the
hop
character
adds
a
good
deal
of
bitterness
which
seems
to
muttle
the
flavor
but
its
still
quite
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
interesting
beer
its
half
hefe
half
ipa
i
didnt
think
the
two
would
work
together
but
it
kinda
does
this
is
a
unique
beer
not
a
session
beer
that
is
tasty
and
enjoyable
for
those
seeking
a
different
beer
or
hybrid
style
i
enjoyed
this
beer
throughout
its
identity
crisis
but
it
lacked
something
to
make
me
love
it
ill
try
it
again
when
possible
to
see
how
the
next
batch
tastes
served
in
a
pint
glass
hazy
and
lightly
golden
big
frothy
head
about
two
fingers
high
peppery
yeast
dominates
the
nose
but
there
is
also
banana
and
wheat
flavor
has
a
more
controlled
yeast
spice
with
more
of
the
wheat
and
banana
coming
through
some
pine
resin
finishes
leaving
a
slight
bitterness
earthy
and
pine
hops
played
a
bigger
role
than
expected
because
i
really
didnt
get
any
in
the
nose
light
body
with
large
flavor
crisp
and
carbonated
a
touch
of
toasty
malt
sweetness
is
evident
at
the
start
with
subtle
banana
joining
in
far
and
away
the
leading
flavor
is
rindy
pithy
puckery
hops
with
the
clove
and
banana
very
restrained
dry
and
crisp
at
the
finish
the
rindy
character
really
stands
out
interesting
offering
i
assumed
it
was
an
ampedup
hefe
and
not
something
like
schneiderbrooklyner
near
the
end
i
swirled
in
all
the
bottle
sediment
which
really
clouded
things
up
nothing
wrong
with
a
healthy
dose
of
yeasties
though
prosit
1353
not
in
love
here
seems
disjointed
and
in
search
of
a
theme
sometimes
what
seems
like
a
good
idea
doesnt
quite
come
together
in
practice
a
bit
dissappointed
with
this
one
as
i
near
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
give
it
a
good
swirl
to
stir
up
some
of
the
yeast
im
expecting
the
yeast
to
be
a
little
more
appealing
to
my
sweet
hefe
loving
palate
well
it
unfortunately
doesnt
make
the
weiss
principal
any
better
for
me
sorry
overall
a
pretty
cool
beer
its
the
first
hefeweizen
ive
ever
handed
to
my
hophead
friend
that
he
liked
actually
he
loved
it
and
hasnt
stopped
raving
about
it
throughout
the
entire
bottle
although
its
not
my
favorite
brew
i
can
sincerely
appreciate
the
creativity
of
the
weiss
principle
ale
it
really
is
the
international
love
child
of
a
hefeweisse
and
an
american
ipa
as
the
label
states
d
this
one
starts
out
very
promising
with
an
excellent
bright
and
peppery
aroma
of
hops
and
spices
the
flavor
profile
unfortunately
fails
miserably
in
its
attempt
to
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
aroma
the
spicy
notes
have
become
an
overwhelming
and
medicinal
phenolic
yeast
character
that
just
overwhelms
everything
else
if
that
werent
enough
the
bitterness
is
excessive
and
pithy
to
the
point
that
it
would
seem
harsh
in
a
dipa
let
alone
a
beer
like
this
i
am
always
a
bit
skeptical
of
imperialized
versions
of
wheat
beers
and
lagers
but
i
have
had
so
many
surprisingly
good
beers
from
peak
that
i
though
this
one
just
might
be
one
of
the
rare
exceptions
sadly
it
was
not
tone
down
the
booze
maybe
bring
it
to
66
5
and
i
feel
like
id
love
this
beer
pours
a
really
clear
deep
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
that
sticks
around
forever
smells
of
clove
and
allspice
with
hints
of
banana
theres
lots
of
spicy
yeast
esters
and
a
bit
of
lemon
in
this
one
and
i
heard
tell
theres
some
malt
in
here
too
but
i
cant
find
it
in
the
nose
oh
there
it
is
first
sip
proves
theres
some
sweet
malt
in
there
taste
is
tart
spicy
phenolicy
theres
malt
up
front
followed
by
an
unpleasant
alcohol
burn
then
some
clove
and
nail
polish
finishes
with
a
lingering
alcohol
burn
mixed
with
lemon
pledge
and
a
bit
of
earthiness
sweet
sticky
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
body
and
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
wow
after
the
last
few
peak
beers
really
impressing
me
this
was
quite
a
letdown
i
dont
think
the
high
level
of
hops
the
spicy
wheat
yeast
and
alcohol
meld
very
well
in
this
one
one
and
done
ontap
at
alewitch
there
are
a
lot
of
bad
beers
out
there
this
is
just
one
of
them
it
pours
a
turbid
yellowgolden
hue
and
is
capped
with
a
frothy
white
head
it
has
a
good
and
sturdy
appearance
the
nose
however
is
just
not
melding
its
various
elements
very
well
and
is
something
of
a
wreck
basic
notes
of
banana
are
to
be
found
in
the
aroma
with
maybe
a
bit
of
bubblegum
cut
grass
and
chlorophyll
but
those
associations
are
quickly
usurped
by
the
familiar
stench
of
wet
latex
paint
ugghh
bitter
unripe
banana
and
overripe
orange
juice
is
generally
suggested
in
the
flavor
atop
of
sweet
and
somewhat
chalky
wheat
the
feel
well
it
is
not
its
fault
overall
this
brew
is
a
tremendous
example
of
how
flavors
and
elements
can
clash
and
produce
negative
results
bad
im
a
guy
who
traditionally
seeks
out
more
extreme
beers
and
heffes
do
not
often
fall
under
the
category
this
beer
on
the
other
hand
has
the
abv
and
bitterness
i
like
in
my
beers
while
still
being
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
one
word
of
caution
however
if
pouring
from
a
bottle
leave
the
last
inch
of
beer
in
the
bottle
i
spoke
with
jon
cadoux
the
head
of
peak
organic
and
he
told
me
that
in
order
to
get
the
abv
they
were
going
for
they
had
to
use
crazy
amount
of
yeast
no
surprise
there
their
decision
to
remain
true
to
heffe
style
and
to
stay
100
unfiltered
means
you
get
a
great
beer
but
you
should
sacrifice
the
last
inch
or
so
to
the
beer
gods
on
tap
at
coles
fruity
colour
a
nice
bitternesssome
lemon
creamy
mouthfeel
altogether
a
good
summer
beer
this
brewery
has
not
disapointed
us
with
a
standard
product
line
pleasant
fruity
and
fresh
yeast
aromas
decent
drinkability
fairy
high
abv
though
overall
super
drinkable
and
great
for
the
summer
reminds
me
of
lagunitas
little
sumpin
lots
of
good
things
going
on
here
a
great
mixture
of
hefeweizen
and
ipa
and
easily
the
best
peak
organic
beer
i
have
had
so
far
poured
a
massive
all
head
first
time
offwhite
in
color
took
awhile
to
settled
down
and
reveal
a
hazy
bright
yellow
body
smells
of
bananas
spices
and
hops
taste
has
a
more
subdued
version
of
the
bananas
and
spices
and
a
greatly
pronounced
ipa
hops
bitterness
finish
is
quite
long
as
i
got
near
the
bottom
of
the
pint
the
subsequent
pours
were
ever
more
cloudy
and
quite
a
lot
of
sediment
was
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
all
in
all
although
its
a
fine
flavorful
beer
i
think
it
overdid
the
ipa
aspect
at
the
expense
of
the
hefeweise
attributes
from
22
ouncer
with
a
tin
foiled
screwoff
cap
i
cannot
believe
how
milky
it
looks
it
is
pale
yellow
on
the
whole
but
it
is
so
milky
and
cloudy
that
it
is
opaque
a
good
sized
head
on
the
nose
i
get
a
good
supply
of
wheat
with
a
bit
of
yeast
and
white
pepper
they
say
theres
clove
in
it
but
i
did
not
notice
that
the
body
is
about
medium
the
taste
has
a
generous
dose
of
wheat
with
a
solid
but
sour
hoppiness
thrown
in
the
higher
abv
is
masked
pretty
well
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
but
it
does
not
represent
the
style
as
well
as
i
had
hoped
i
dont
expect
i
would
buy
it
again
anyway
pours
a
cloudy

i
liked
it
a

better
once
i
read
the
side
of
the
bottle
and
realized
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
cross
between
an
iipa
and
a
hef
its
almost
like
drinking
two
strong
beers
at
once
which
is
unique
and
interesting
i
think
ill
pass
next
time
though
overall
kinda
meh
way
too
sweet
too
bitter
not
the
kinda
beer
that
should
be
imperialized
this
one
tastes
a
little

poison

the
concept
of
this
beer
just
doesnt
work
for
me
very
disappointing
owhat
i
said
in

sums
it
up
this
beer
is
just
a
high

else

drinking

the

had
no

any

alcohol
is

a

overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
o
for
me
there
is
no
redeeming
quality
in
this
beer
it
is
cold
for
once
in
florida
and
i
should
have
gotten
old
rasputin
tried
something
new
and
immediately
regret
it
this
is
an
awful
beer

taste
is

like
others
have
mentioned
there
is
an
apple
cider
flavor
in
this
one
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
what
it
is
but
not
something
i
would
get
again
not
the
best
weizenbock
experience
out
there
not
by
a
long
shot
i
guess
bombers
for
3
99
are
too
good
a
thing
to
be
true
unless
theyre
totally
local
and
this
one
definitely
is
not
oh
well
nose
is
pleasant
enough
although
a
fairly
tame
combo
of
caramel
tangy
wheat
and
whiffs
of

more

less
as
advertised

more

take

overall
i
think
its
a
good
value
so
i
think
i
will
get
this
one
again

just
a
touch
of
cloves
body
is
about
average
and
texture
is
smooth

fizzy

a
tingly
and
somewhat
complex
finish
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
into
a
snifter
i
get
a
dark
copper
body
with
a
deep
haziness
and
a
small
head
that
settles
to
a
collar
aromas
are
predominantly
of
prunes
and
plumbs
with
notes
of
sweet
wheat
and
something
reminiscent
of
bread
pudding
the
taste
is
initially
sweet
with
raisins
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
buts
quickly
gives
way
to
increasingly
bitter
notes
first
of
toastiness
and
then
of
wood
and
leafiness
it
doesnt
finish
as
well
as
it
starts
and
leaves
me
with
the
taste
of
burnt
biscuits
the
body
is
quite
full
and
carbonated
in
a
way
that
lends
an
appropriate
austerity
to
its
complicated
flavor
and
gives
a
smoothness
to
what
would
otherwise
be
a
mostly
astringent
beer
i
love
the
texture
and
think
that
the
flavor
is
good
for
the
most
part
and
ultimately
hope
this
beer
is
improved
in
the
batches
to
come
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
weizenbock
but
not
something
i
would
purchase
again

inhibited

its

d
one
and
done
not
a
beer
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
recommend
not
a
terrible
beer
by
any
means
but
certainly
no
where
close
to
other
weizenbocks
out
there
if
you
are
into
hoppy
ambers
check
this
one
out
but
dont
feel
bad
if
you
pass
on
by
its
weird
enough
to
be
interesting
to
a
degree
but
the
yeast
flavors
and
their
oxidized
notes
tear
it
apart
though
brewed
as
a
lager
the
bock
expresses
greater
flavor
upon
warming
when
a
substantial
influx
of
malt
sweetness
and
noble
hop
spice
step
forward
not
an
everyday
beer
but
thats
by
design
all
in
all
an
unusual
tasty
and
very
drinkable
beer
and
it
was
inexpensive
to
boot
should
have
bought
more
yum
pretty
good
weizenbock
here
fruity
yeast
esters
bring
notes
of
pear

pineapple
while
the
hop
finish
is
slightly
citric
a

too
hoppy
for
the
style
but
it
works
some
alcohol
heat
is
detected
in
the
finish
as
well
the
creamy
fullbody
is
smooth
and
has
a
spoton
carbonation
level
overall
a
drinkable
weizenbock

at

i
would
probably
have
this

the
proper
circumstances

as

weizenbocks

beers
in

go

on
this
one
the
taste
is
a
bit
unusual
strong
and
for
me
not
real
pleasing
its
not
a
very
sessionable
ale
im
not
much
on
the

some
people
might
well
like
this
brew
i
can

im
not

i
sure
as

am

going
to

it
2
945
im
certainly
left
frigid
over
this
one
o
i
was
anticipating
something
different
based
on
the
smell
and
appearance
but
the
hop
and
bitter
aroma
was
unnoticable
to
me
but
was
not
mistaken
on
the
taste
while
the
dark
fruits
and
spices
may
have
been
there
i
didnt
pick
them
up
overall
decent
but
nothing
magical
i
was
a
little
surprised
on
pouring
this
beer
because
i
was
expecting
a
pale
ale
based
on
the
label
what
came
out
of
the
bottle
was
a
medium
brown
with
a
smell
more
like
a
porter
the
taste
also
was
much
like
a
porter
the
beer
was
good
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
doesnt
get
anywhere
near
10
below
here
but
hey
lets
give
a
whirl
anyway
popping
the
top
i
get
a
cocoa
smell
with
some
malt
in
the
background
pours
to
a
translucent
deep
brown
with
a
tan
multibubble
head
that
recedes
quickly
on
the
taste
this
brew
hits
with
some
chalky
cocoa
upfront
with
some
earthy
hops
and
transitions
to
a
sweeter
chocolate
and
toasted
malt
background
with
a
spicy
but
clean
flat
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
with
all
the
flavors
its
not
an
issue
this
is
unbelievably
a
7

abv
would
never
guess
that
my
type
of
brew
standout
basic
flavors
particularly
cocoa
not
complex
but
very
drinkable
waxy
burnt
taste
upon
sipping
syrupy
and
very
little
carbonation
aftertaste
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
and
black
licorice
was
hoping
for
a
stronger
fruit
taste
but
instead
its
just
spice
and
staleness
overall
just
above
average
with
hints
of
just
being
average
the
cloying
aspects
mellow
and
make
the
beer
more
accessible
but
they
dont
make
it
more
interesting
possibly
worth
at
try
but
i
wouldnt
dwell
on
that
decision
to
long
an
enjoyable
sipper
poured
from
bomber
to
glass
great
dark
color
with
a
slight
ruby
hue
thick
tan
head
and
left
lots
of
lace
to
decorate
the
glass
i
didnt
pick
up
crisp
citrus
aroma
as
listed
by
the
brewer
it
was
a
tad
sweet
with
coffeebitter
aftertaste
medium
viscosity
above
average
essence
of
alcohol
i
pulled
it
out
of
a
fridge
at
37deg
but
as
it
warmed
to
room
temp
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
was
enhanced
it
was
a
real
enjoyable
beer
ill
be
drinking
again
for
sure
a
bit
of
discrepancy
on
style
per
the
brewers
site
this
one
and
rb
others
list
as
dunkelweissdunkelweizen
one
of
many
ways
to
be
happy
during
the
colder
season
is
to
drink
this
winter
warmer
its
hold
on
its
a
weizenbock
i
wouldnt
have
suspected
great
winter
beer
that
tastes
more
like
jubelale
than
a
weizenbock
i
got
lots
of
hops
and
lots
of
malt
and
a
very
smooth
luscious
mouthfeel
everything
i
wanted
in
a
winter
warmer
will
need
to
buy
a
few
of
these
while
they
last
great
stuff
and
a
little
under
the
radar
o
pretty
damn
good
i
would
buy
this
again
i
wonder
if
its
a
actually
lageredi
think
weizenbocks
are
supposed
to
be

it
tastes
very
similar
to
many
winter
warmers
of
the
west
particularly
pyramid
snow

i
would
mistake
for
an
ale
in
an
instant
and
also
would
not
guess
that
it
is
a
wheat
beer
did
i
not
know
the
style
im
an

if
it
is
a

standard
characteristic
of
most
winter
warmer
ales
had
never
heard
of
this
brewing
company
before
so
was
not

so
malty

and
coffee
are
the
three
flavors
that
come
to

when
taking
a
sip
slightly
sweet
nothing
special
about
this
brew
o
not
really

this
beer
its
almost

will

this

the
flavors
are
not
overpowering
i
prefer
a
little
less
bitterness
but
the
esters
are
nice
and
complex
they
definitely
dominate
i
think
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
almost
makes
the
beer
taste
flatstale
thats
what
kills
it
for
me
i
thought
sierra
nevadas
take
on
this
style
might
be
an
abomination
that
is
that
they
might
hop
it
to
the
gills
fortunately
this
is
a
very
traditional
interpretation
i
like
it
a
lot
its
sweet
and
malty
and
not
too
lemony
bravo
quite
enjoyable
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to

for

if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style

with

form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is

malt
brown
sugar
caramel
toffee
banana

taste
is
much
the

with
earth
caramel
banana
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
great
smell
but
the
flavors
are
more
earthy
than
i
was
expecting
very
hazy
beer
with
great
head
retention
the
beers
almost
looks
like
real
new
england
apple
cider
that
is
a
little
foamy
similar
in
color
and
cloudiness
i
got
a
yeasty
aroma
of
clove
and
just
strait
up
yeast
for
the
flavor
i
was
picking
up
on
some
wheat
and
other
malt
flavors
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
not
sure
if
the
looks
of
the
beer
caused
my
to
think
this
but
to
me
the
beer
almost
tasted
like
graff
a
malty
mixture
with
some
slight
apple
notes
and
a
similar
mouth
feel
minus
the
acidity
very
interesting
beer
i
would
love
to
know
how
they
brewed
it
overall
good
to
really
good
beer
which
seems
to
be
fairly
representative
of
the
style
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
comparable
beers
but
i
seem
to
recall
this
is
one
of
the
german
ale
styles
that
i
prefer
definitely
worth
a
try
and
a
beer
i
wish
to
drink
again
dear

please
make

oooh

and
i
keep
thinking
back
and
think
back
some
more
and
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
had
one
this
one
works
pretty
well
but
what
the
hell
is
in
this
a
lemon
peel
or
something
either
way
the
beer
is
solid
hard
style
to
pull
off
well
but
it
happens
here
i
can
dig
it
m
bright
refreshing
carbonation
does
a
great
job
of
keeping
the
huge
flavor
profile
in
check
medium
light
body
this
was
one
of
the
beer
i
had
at
the
sierra
nevada
beer
dinner
at
kickbacks
ni
ce
bneer
big
banana
medium
bodied
was
a
great
night
had
amazingly
paired
food
with
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
breweries
i
would
love
to
have
this
beer
again
as
well
as
others
from
the
night
yeah
a
good
big
weizen
i
did
love
the
sierra
nevada
kellerweiss
and
the
question
must
be
raised
as
to
whether
this
is
just
a
big
version
its
bigger
but
not
really
more
complex
or
interesting
its
only
6
6
so
i
feel
like
if
they
upped
the
malt
a
bit
more
made
it
even
bigger
and
sweeter
it
could
be
spectacular
im
not
a
big
fan
of
weizenbocks
to
begin
with
but
i
decided
to
trade
my
buddy
for
one
of
these
anyway
this
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
fingers
width
of
off
white
head
the
beer
smells
of
yeast
spice
and
citrus
taste
does
pack
a
punch
of
yeast
spice
banana
some
cloves
and
citrus
way
to
much
banana
and
yeast
spice
for
my
liking
on
the
other
hand
it
does
leave
a
nice
lingering
tangerine
after
taste
it
hasnt
swayed
my
taste
for
this
type
of
brew
but
i
tried
to
note
it
fairly
my
friends
love
it
go
out
and
try
one
for
yourself
o
nowhere
near
a
miss
but
not
the
highlight
of
the
mixed
case
either
overall
i
enjoyed
this
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
a
sixer
this
was
probably
my
least
favorite
from
the
beer
camp
case
however
that
doesnt
mean
it
wasnt
good
still
a
very
solid
brew
overall
a
real
summer
time
beer
i
could
see
drinking
this
in
90
degree
weather
after
mowing
the
grass
or
at
a
cookout
its
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
but
bluemoon
fans
would
enjoy
this
very
easy
to
drink
and
to
enjoy
dr
drinkable
enough
but
lacking
a
bold
or
inspired
quality
its
fairly
priced
but
boring
wheres
the
beef
i
wish
sierra
nevada
would
make
beer
camp
weizenbock
37
a
regular
offering
to
date
my
favorite
american
brewed
weizenbock
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
wheat
yeast
slight
alcohol
and
slight
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
weizenbock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
wheat
yeast
slight
citrus
slight
spice
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
overall
lacking
in
appearance
but
good
aroma
feel
body
and
blend
hv
o
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
id
like
to
have
this
again
the
beer
is
very
slightly
hazy
and
light
orange
hued
with
a
smallish
head
that
leaves
some
caked
on
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
brings
banana
sweet
malt
fruit
wheat
the
flavor
is
decent
sweet
and
fruity
with
emphasis
on
bananas
mediumthin
in
body
with
adequate
carbonation
a
decent
beer
but
not
in
the
same
league
as
aventinus
o
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
would
love
to
see
this
one
in
the
regular
rotation
from
sierra
nevada
highly
recommended
final
notes
one
very
good
wheat
beer
lots
of
flavor
smooth
deliciously
sweet
reminds
me
of
grandmas
homemade
banana
bread
highly
recommended
a
good
beer
that
grew
on
me
as
it
went
on
one
of
the
best
hefes
ive
had
rich
with
a
tanginesstartness
and
a
refreshing
aspect
that
masks
the
apparent
weight
of
the
beer
this
is
really
good
full
bodied
with
a
medium
effervescence
finish
is
both
tangy
and
mellow
so
glad
i
had
this
drinkability
was
very
good
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
no
signs
of
abv
and
had
some
great
flavor
o
as
above
this
has
all
the
pieces
but
the
puzzle
isnt
quite
finished
here
if
they
took
another
crack
at
this
i
would
give
it
another
go
but
as
it
stands
not
quite
on
the
level
i
would
expect
for
sierra
a
very
nice
wheat
beer
seems
to
be
a
bit
more
complex
than
what
i
expect
for
the
style
it
goes
down
nice
and
easy
and
i
could
see
drinking
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
very
much
worth
a
try
d
does
not
disappoint
stellar
brew
from
sierra
nevada
make
this
one
year
round
because
i
will
make
a
designated
area
for
it
in
my
fridge
this
tastes
like
a
nice
weizenbock
to
me
although
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
or
one
that
ive
had
too
often
glad
to
have
tried
a
few
as
part
of
this
mix
pack
12
oz
into
a
snifter
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
beer
camp
beers
really
an
awesome
brew
big
straw
yellow
cloudy
body
with
generous
head
tons
of
nose
of
wheat
and
yeast
funk
they
nailed
both
the
weizen
and
the
bock
so
to
speak
i
mean
nailed
it
its
great
with
just
enough
noble
hops
to
balance
it
and
nothing
more
its
very
rare
that
i
would
say
this
about
the
aroma
of
an
american
edition
of
a
german
style
but
it
competes
with
the
best
germans
taste
follows
suit
with
big
wheat
and
fruity
characteristics
mouthfeel
is
robust
energetic
and
quite
simply
flawless
overall
try
it
if
you
find
it
great
beer
compatible
with
multiple
foods
the
first
i
have
had
of
this
style
look
forward
to
trying
others
tasty
tasy
brew
a
pitcher
please
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
quite
pleasant
aroma
was
light
there
was
lots
of
grassy
grain
like
smells
in
hear
with
a
decent
enough
amount
of
yeast
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
flavor
was
brilliant
full
of
life
and
grain
for
that
matter
a
very
belgian
like
flavor
witha
good
amount
of
light
fruit
like
yeast
and
hints
of
pears
and
apples
mixed
in
among
the
various
grain
like
flavors
very
light
with
huge
carbonation
this
was
so
amply
carbonated
i
do
not
even
know
where
t
begin
just
a
great
light
feel
and
smooth
crisp
clean
finish
really
a
winner
here
for
sure
very
light
bright
flavors
mixed
in
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
to
give
it
just
that
right
feel
really
made
this
a
winner
i
could
have
easily
had
a
few
overall
not
bad
not
what
i
expected
the
mouth
is
a
little
flat
and
not
what
i
expected
o
nice
notes
not
something
that
will
make
the
beer
camp
mixer
that
memorable
but
a
reliable
inclusion
lighter
in
color
and
with
a
sweeter
palate
than
other
interpretations
but
likable
nevertheless
i
love
german
hefes
and
i
wish
i
could
get
this
beer
year
round
taste
was
again
wheaty
yeasty
bananay
very
bready
light
sandwich
in
a
bottle
good
creamy
and
chewy
aspects
other
slight
citrus
flavors
as
well
but
not
from
hoppiness
which
is
all
but
absent
as
it
tradionally
should
be
im
not
a
weizenbock
guy
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
youd
be
crazy
not
to
realize
this
is
a
legitimate
beer
overall
this
the
first
time
ive
had
a
weizenbock
and
i
liked
this
interpretation
of
the
style
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
warm
sunday
afternoon
o
great
beer
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
but
this
was
excellent
from
the
appearance
to
the
taste
one
of
the
beers
available
within
the
sn
beer
camp
12
pk
mixer
this
one
is
a
winner
dont
see
all
that
many
domestic
weizenbocks
and
frankly
id
be
hard
put
to
think
of
a
better
one
than
this
impressive
stuff
well
worth
trying
out
a
bit
potent
a
bit
sweet
and
a
bit
intense
as
a
weizenbock
but
certainly
delicious
and
approachable
not
one
i
would
regularly
drink
but
as
a
mix
in
the
pack
its
certainly
not
doing
any
harm
good
try
some
o
big
citrus
flavor
with
good
balance
again
i
feel
it
is
the
best
of
this
multipak
2
would
go
to
the
double
ipa
but
that
tastes
much
like
many
of
their
other
special
selections
which
are
of
course
pretty
good
i
was
not
blown
away
by
this
but
nice
foray
for
sierra
nevada
i
would
like
to
see
more
varieties
which
are
not
so
piney
and
hoppy
i
look
forward
to
seeing
what
the
next
beer
camp
consists
of
great
little
brew
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
disclaimer
i
very
little
experience
with
the
style
but
i
will
certainly
be
exploring
it
picked
up
a
single
because
i
like
weizenbocks
this
is
how
i
like
them
on
the
sweet
side
with
good
banana
presence
and
not
too
much
clove
tasty
stuff
this
was
a
delight
to
have
on
tap
especially
at
this
time
of
year
poured
into
a
tumbler
the
beer
was
a
hazy
amberbrown
color
with
ecru
colored
finger
and
a
half
head
that
reduced
to
a
thin
film
that
laced
the
glass
nicely
the
smell
was
a
little
spicy
but
big
on
banana
the
taste
reflected
some
banana
and
had
some
very
tart
citrus
notes
in
there
as
well
there
is
a
sweet
bready
malt
character
behind
it
all
which
just
keeps
it
together
the
aftertaste
was
of
spicy
whole
cloves
which
i
enjoyed
in
this
instance
the
body
was
thickish
velvety
and
smooth
d
a
very
nice
weizenbock
easy
drinking
and
full
flavored
d
very
drinkable
flavors
are
really
well
balanced
and
complex
enough
the
banana
and
spices
really
work
well
together
here
the
spices
in
the
finish
are
also
really
nice
o
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
a
little
above
average
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
definitely
the
best
out
of
the
beer
camp
12
pack
they
got
a
great
balance
between
the
wheat
malt
and
yeast
spice
where
it
seems
a
lot
let
the
yeast
spice
overpower
the
beer
very
solid
beer
overall
and
one
i
really
hope
makes
an
appearance
again
in
sierras
line
up
there
definitely
is
not
enough
good
versions
of
this
style
around
especially
under
7
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
far
from
it
as
it
turns
up
the
banana
and
vanilla
notes
banana
pudding
anyone
seriously
this
stuff
is
like
the
beerform
of
vanilla
wafer
banana
pudding
succulent
finish
of
orange
peel
and
creamy
wheat
malts
mouthfeel
is
perfect
with
a
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
level
all
in
all
this
is
not
only
the
best
of
the
sn
beer
camp
12pack
but
one
of
the
best
weizenbocks
ive
had
it
helps
that
it
is
uberfresh
not
exactly
typical
of
the
style
but
definitely
in
the
same
vein
as
brooklynschneiders
hopfenweisse
if
sierra
nevada
released
this
beer
in
sixpacks
or
bombers
id
be
all
over
it
overall
its
just
meh
for
me
falls
well
short
of
the
epitome
of
the
style
aventinus
or
weihenstephaner
vitus
in
complexity
and
flavor
its
good
but
not
notable
a
rare
letdown
from
sierra
nevada
pour
me
another
one
please
o
this
is
a
damn
fine
brew
seems
to
do
everything
really
well
this
may
not
be
a
beer
for
comparison
against
more
classic
german
seize
hocks
but
still
manages
to
harken
back
to
the
style
with
a
more
american
viewpoint
the
feel
is
well
bodied
and
very
smooth
sweet
on
the
palate
but
not
cloying
again
very
smooth
this
is
the
best
american
weizenbock
ive
tasted
yet
flavor
body
and
scent
are
all
there
the
bavarian
masters
would
respect
this
offering
from
sierra
nevada
d
i
love
weizens
and
this
is
among
the
best
ive
had
smooth
and
complex
without
being
over
bearing
i
wish
i
could
buy
a
12
pack
of
this
for
summer
time
this
is
the
first
weizenbock
that
i
have
official
reviewed
but
i
do
want
to
note
that
aventinus
is
one
of
my
all
time
favs
but
never
got
around
to
reviewing
it
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
has
a
nice
fruity
yet
dry
mixed
with
wheat
profile
it
is
quite
sessionable
and
perfect
for
warmer
weather
first
one
out
of
beer
camp
is
quite
promising
taste
of
wheat
with
some
banana
thrown
into
the
mix
its
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
just
right
it
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
overall
im
digging
it
sierra
nevada
beer
camp
lets
see
what
else
you
have
to
offer
d
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
you
wont
mind
drinking
a
few
of
these
it
is
quite
tasty
without
being
overpowering
it
successfully
blends
the
wheat
and
spices
to
create
a
fine
example
of
a
weizenbock
included
in
the
beer
camp
mix
pack
big
punch
of
banana
ester
at
the
front
followed
by
more
fruity
esters
and
a
candysugar
sweetness
that
veers
perhaps
a
bit
toward
belgian
influences
substantial
malt
body
leaves
no
question
as
to
the
bock
aspect
of
the
beer
quite
nice
after
3
successes
i
was
excited
to
try
this
last
bottle
however
i
was
greeted
with
a
bit
of
early
disappointment
completely
impenetrable
orange
liquid
with
a
smallish
head
bananas
and
bandages
a
little
clove
a
bit
offputting
on
the
nose
flavor
improves
though
slightly
sweet
bananas
vanilla
clove
licorice
sweet
banana
is
nice
but
overall
im
just
not
all
that
jazzed
about
this
brew
cold
and
cool
the
bandage
aroma
was
apparent
warm
it
faded
into
the
background
behind
the
clove
glad
it
wasnt
a
total
fall
but
much
lower
than
the
other
3
beer
camp
performances
maybe
ill
try
another
bottle
pours
a
very
murky
unfiltered
goldenorange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
very
yeasty
with
some
strong
clove
and
banana
aromas
also
a
bit
of
floral
as
well
as
earthy
notes
reach
my
nostrils
taste
is
very
yeasty
with
nice
balance
of
green
apples
banana
spices
and
light
citrus
a
little
overly
sweet
for
my
liking
though
mouthfeel
is
very
fullbodied
almost
thick
yet
refreshing
drinkability
is
fairly
high
as
if
it
were
less
sweet
it
would
be
a
much
better
beer
overall
not
a
bad
weizenbock
not
even
close
to
being
my
favorite
style
but
not
bad
for
what
it
is
a
little
dry
and
thin
to
be
considered
among
the
giants
of
style
kudos
to
the
effort
pours
a
classic
milky
dark
golden
orange
with
a
frothy
cap
nose
hints
you
in
the
face
with
clove
and
coriander
followed
by
sweet
spicy
yeast
notes
classic
banana
and
maybe
a
touch
of
foreign
citrus
kumquat
yuzu
taste
brings
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
a
bit
of
pepper
and
cinnamon
it
does
finish
a
bit
dry
and
astrigent
and
that
would
be
my
only
knock
against
it
it
doesnt
leave
my
palate
refreshed
and
ready
for
more
very
nice
beer
overall
for
the
style
weizenbocks
are
one
of
those
styles
that
i
like
but
only
in
small
doses
this
beer
is
no
exception
as
i
enjoy
it
but
would
not
want
to
have
another
this
evening
i
bought
this
as
part
of
sns
beer
camp
mixed
12
pack
im
looking
forward
to
see
how
the
other
offerings
taste
o
honestly
impressed
this
is
a
great
lighter
beer
with
nice
sweeter
flavors
and
a
smooth
finish
imo
the
best
of
the
beer
camp
mixed
pack
a
rough
pour
rustled
up
a
thick
foamy
head
that
left
plenty
of
lacing
in
the
glass
mega
cloudy
with
a
deep
yellow
color
with
orange
highlights
insane
hefeweizen
yeast
aroma
that
had
a
nice
balance
of
banana
like
esters
and
pleasantly
smoky
band
aid
phenols
which
also
presented
a
melange
of
tropical
fruit
floral
and
even
a
bit
of
a
soapy
like
kids
bubbles
background
balanced
yeast
flavor
carried
over
into
the
flavor
making
it
somewhat
similar
to
a
sweet
apple
pie
a
little
sweet
and
thick
to
the
palate
but
not
enough
to
become
too
cloying
only
critique
i
have
of
this
beer
as
that
it
needs
more
hop
character
to
give
a
bit
more
dimension
and
drinkability
a
bit
more
bitterness
and
just
a
little
hop
flavor
would
put
this
into
another
tier
of
its
own
i
like
this
example
of
the
style
its
highly
drinkable
pours
a
beatiful
clouded
banana
smoothie
hue
with
a
bright
slightly
off
white
head
forming
thick
with
creamy
textured
head
fine
speckled
lacing
with
chunks
mixed
in
the
pattern
labeled
as
the
best
of

aroma
has
sharp
wheat
with
banana
bread
and
citrus
notes
arising
strong
flavor
is
everything
i
enjoy
about
kellerweiss
with
a
bit
more
punch
to
it
sharp
citruswheat
combonation
with
hints
of
spicy
yeastbananaclove
esters
coming
forth
this
is
a
very
satisfying
wheat
beer
i
had
not
idea
that
sierra
nevada
were
actually
wheat
beer
pros
that
hid
behind
the
the
sierra
nevada
wheat
with
the
red
label
for
years
which
was
a
dull
american
wheat
without
any
yeast
fireworks
from
the
german
versions
mouthfeel
is
satisfyingly
carbonated
with
enough
texture
and
girth
the
keep
any
craft
beer
drinker
happy
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
back
end
but
its
well
orchestrated
within
the
context
of
different
flavors
offered
from
this
beer
overall
damn
quality
weizenbock
that
i
wish
more
craftbrewers
would
perfect
like
this
drinkability
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
but
its
decent
a
tinge
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
id
never
guess
this
beer
was
almost
7
maybe
a
bit
more
yeast
spiciness
would
add
something
else
to
kick
it
up
a
notch
decent
but
not
my
favorite
taste
is
great
nice
and
spicy
with
mild
spices
strong
banana
and
clove
flavors
and
an
unreal
bubblegum
flavor
this
is
by
far
the
strongest
original
bubblegum
flavored
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
i
would
say
this
is
the
best
beer
in
the
mixed
beer
camp
package
there
is
a
medium
to
thicker
body
for
a
weizenbock
which
is
really
done
well
i
would
get
this
year
round
if
they
were
to
offer
it
a
little
too
sweet
for
menonetheless
it
is
very
pleasant
esp
for
hot
andor
humid
summer
days
and
nights
a
little
more
complexity
and
maltiness
would
help
restrain
the
sweetness
and
balance
it
out
o
i
like
the
big
bold
smell
and
flavor
its
a
little
too
big
to
be
a
thirst
quencher
but
if
you
like
a
strong
wheat
beer
taste
this
is
good
stuff
really
really
liking
this
what
an
absolute
perfect
summer
beer
the
drinkability
is
outstanding
an
all
around
terrific
beer
with
a
slight
exception
to
the
nose
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
buy
sixers
of
this
bad
boy
its
a
good
beer
but
it
just
lacks
the
layered
flavors
of
better
light
weizenbocks
like
vitus
a
must
try
i
like
this
beer
what
can
i
say
drinkability
is
good
nice
weizenbock
fits
the
style
rather
well
while
this
isnt
really
my
favorite
style
it
reminds
me
of
weihenstephaner
vitus
not
quite
as
good
but
still
a
fine
example
reviewed
on
06212009
i
had
this
on
draft
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
melon
and
clove
the
flavor
is
more
fruity
with
tropical
fruits
lemon
and
citrus
it
is
rather
light
and
refreshing
a
nice
surprise
d
sweeter
than
i
usually
drink
but
i
didnt
mind
in
this
case
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
too
thin
as
well
very
smooth
and
light
really
smooth
lemon
orange
yeast
and
wheat
this
beer
went
down
so
easy
and
was
very
enjoyable
thanks
mike
overall
impression
a
light
refreshing
spicy
weizenbock
notes
my
favorite
sn
offering
but
not
my
favorite
weizenbock
that
might
be
moonglow
weizenbock
from
victory
or
maybe
glockenspiel
weizenbock
from
great
lakes
found
this
on
draft
at
bukowskis
back
bay
served
in
a
pint
glass
bright
yellow
color
with
a
haziness
to
it
not
unlike
a
hefeweizen
thin
white
head
well
carbonated
smelled
a
lot
like
fresh
squeezed
lemons
and
coriander
taste
was
excellent
flavors
of
grass
citrus
and
wheat
shone
through
very
easy
beer
to
drink
high
abv
was
noted
but
since
it
was
such
a
light
and
smooth
beer
i
didnt
care
id
love
to
see
this
bottled
for
summertime
a
great
new
offering
from
sn
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
recedes
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
quite
lovely
with
the
little
yeasties
making
there
presence
know
with
a
very
noticeable
amount
of
esters
the
sweet
malt
flavor
full
body
and
good
carbonation
make
this
a
really
good
beer
great
beer
when
will
they
bottle
this
in
bombers
and
stock
my
local
beer
store
not
as
good
as
vitus
but
you
should
try
it
slightly
hazy
darkened
golden
in
color
beneath
a
creamy
white
head
stable
ringed
lacing
throughout
until
the
last
sip
clean
strong
banana
esters
with
notes
of
mild
tropical
fruit
semisweet
creamy
malt
with
hints
of
vanilla
the
bright
banana
and
melon
esters
are
rounded
and
clean
clean
clove
spice
that
leads
to
a
smooth
finish
medium
bodied
smooth
and
rounded
which
matched
the
flavors
perfectly
im
a
sucker
for
a
weizenbock
anyway
and
this
one
doesnt
miss
the
mark
at
all
pronounced
flavors
balanced
alcohol
and
smooth
texture
this
is
odd
and
actually
mislabeled
but
is
enjoyable
and
coming
from
sierra
nevada
rather
surprising
i
dont
believe
ive
had
a
german
brew
from
them
before
recommended
let
it
sit
and
warm
up
and
you
can
drink
quite
a
lot
of
these
im
on
glass
number
two
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
an
awesome
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
monster
banana
and
clove
aroma
it
has
a
large
malt
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
super
smooth
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
with
ease
and
finishes
with
a
really
nice
yeastiness
it
appears
quite
simple
but
its
not
lacking
in
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
near
perfect
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
perfect
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
weizenbocks
ive
ever
had
it
hides
the
warmth
well
and
is
so
damn
smooth
seek
out
this
along
with
the
ruthless
hefeweizen
o
not
a
beer
im
going
to
revisit
often
but
glad
i
tried
it
nonetheless
it
feels
unbalanced
and
hastily
assembled
i
was
totally
shocked
when
i
found
out
that
this
was
a
bock
beer
this
is
something
i
need
to
educate
myself
on
the
differences
between
a
barley
wine
and
a
bock
beer
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
smooth
35
somewhat
foamy
25
mouthfeel
thats
suitable
for
the
high
ethanol
content
of
the
beer
closes
dryly
with
mediumhigh
levels
of
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
o
age
tames
the
alcohol
a
bit
but
this
is
still
a
little
more
simplified
and
rough
around
the
edges
compared
to
the
better
examples
of
the
style
a
very
admirable
effort
though
and
the
rarity
of
the
style
in
this
neck
of
the
woods
means
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
weizenbocks
available
taste
is
malty
all
the
way
was
a
bit
toasty
with
hints
of
nuttiness
plus
a
touch
of
cookie
dough
i
also
picked
up
flavors
akin
to
brown
bread
everything
got
better
as
the
bier
warmed
pretty
good
all
in
all
zum

overall
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
style
of
beer
im
not
exactly
a
fan
not
bad
a
style
that
is
rarely
recreated
it
deserves
more
and
i
commend
atwater
block
for
attempting
it
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
decent
amount
of
malts
on
the
nose
there
is
also
an
earthy
lager
yeast
aroma
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
nicely
balanced
between
the
malts
and
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
bock
to
try
its
not
something
i
would
buy
a
whole
case
of
it
though
hopefully
ill
like
this
offering
more
than
most
of
the
others
form
this
brewery
in
the
d
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
a
rich
deep
burnt
orange
infused
amber
with
a
sticky
one
finger
off
white
head
that
settles
nicely
into
a
frothy
mass
leaving
one
big
sheet
of
lace
some
green
apple
and
bubble
gum
notes
in
the
grains
and
a
light
caramel
sweetness
perhaps
only
a
bit
of
banana
flavour
has
wheat

and
adds
a
bit
of
nuttiness
i
also
pick
up
some
apple
notes
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
dry
finish
and
some
late
alcohol
warmth
noted
this
is
a
good
beer
but
havent
had
anything
else
that
was
all
that
good
with
a
citric
hop
presence
some
alcohol
is
noticable
but
not
detracting
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
drinkability
is
good
and
worth
trying
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
chimay
blue
driving
a
hotrod
than
a
malty
german
dunkelweizen
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
wateriness
around
the
edges
somewhat
overcarbonated
and
thin
for
the
style
mouthfeel
still
smooth
soft
but
more
a
mass
of
foam
than
desired
while
nothing
extraordinary
this
is
yet
another
very
nice
effort
from
the
folks
at
aktienbrauerei
not
your
typical
weizenbock
with
the
addition
of
the
tart
apple
flavor
but
tasty
nonetheless
and
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
considering
the
7
2
listing
o
the
good
flavor
components
were
good
but
the
off
flavors
were
just
a
bit
too
off
d
in
a
word
disappointing
d
this
is
not
horrid
but
its
not
terribly
good
either
kind
of
all
over
the
place
awkward
to
a
degree
a
passable
weizenbock
beer
is
sweet
too
sweet
for
the
style
imo
medium
bodied
theres
the
carbonation
maybe
the
bartender
should
have
shook
the
beer
or
served
it
at
50
degree
to
get
a
head
its
all
over
my
mouth
filling
the
palate
its
a
little
distracting
unfortunately
drinkability
is
fine
with
this
beer
its
overall
an
average
weizenbock
the
palate
opens
yeasty
and
estery
with
a
some
banana
and
a
fruit
bread
like
character
the
palate
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
nose
would
let
on
and
thats
for
the
better
caramel
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
appear
midpalate
along
with
a
touch
of
clove
i
also
get
a
little
burnt
sugar
and
thats
a
great
touch
sweet
bready
and
mildly
yeasty
on
the
finish
with
the
alcohol
cutting
through
the
sweetness
just
enough
this
feels
quite
great
on
the
palate
the
high
level
of
carbonation
is
a
little
distracting
especially
coupled
with
the
medium
body
the
finish
also
has
a
little
phenolic
character
which
i
appreciate
all
told
a
very
enjoyable
weizenbock
one
that
i
will
drink
again
without
a
doubt
drinkability
i
like
it
well
enough
though
its
not
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
i
look
forward
to
revisiting
this
beer
after
i
have
a
little
more
experience
with
the
weizenbock
genre
on
the
whole
i
strongly
recommend
this
beer
to
any
wheat
beer
aficionado
if
youre
not
familiar
with
the
style
start
with
a
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
dunkel
work
your
way
up
to
schneider
aventinus
and
then
give
this
one
a
try
poured
a
nice
clear
dark
gold
into
my
glass
with
a
one
inch

ive
only
recently
begun
to
explore
the
many
styles
of
german
beer
and
this
one
is
a
pretty
good
example
its
style
pours
a
dark
yellowishbrown
brown
copper
color
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
musky
aroma
that
is
dominated
by
clove
spiciness
slight
chocolate
malt
presence
flavor
is
once
again
dominated
by
cloves
a
little
bit
of
licorice
chocolate
malt
very
carbonated
with
a
spicy
roastiness
up
front
followed
by
a
sweet
malty
center
and
dry
finish
d
good
beer
i
like
the
style
because
its
so
heavy
hitting
and
dark
as
the
beerignorant
like
to
categorize
beer
but
its
also
very
quenching
and
refreshing
an
excellent
winter
sports
beer
for
sledding
skiing
and
hiking
in
the
colder
months
pours
a
slightly
murky
apple
juice
cider
color
the
head
is
barely
a
quarter
inch
and
dissipates
in
a
flash
no
lacing
and
little
floaties
are
not
helping
this
look
any
better
the
nose
is
of
fermented
fruits
and
hints
of
alcohol
and
caramel
lots
of
complex
flavors
keep
inline
with
the
nose
slightly
souring
pear
and
other
fruitsmaybe
apple
and
over
ripened
banana
lots
of
yeasty
flavors
and
bread
like
malts
balance
this
nicely
tons
of
fizzy
carbonationstrange
how
small
the
head
is
on
this
overly
carbonated
brewmedium
body
and
subtly
warming
on
the
throat
very
enjoyable
a
heady
beer
with
a
real
strong
malty
flavour
a
little
rough
and
ready
with
an
almost
applejuice
nose
however
what
saves
this
beer
from
being
hard
to
drink
is
the
great
finish
that
pulls
everything
together
not
my
favourite
and
maybe
worth
putting
down
in
the
cellar
to
smooth
it
out
good
bubbling
as
i
peer
into
this
sediment
filled
muddy
rust
hue
only
a
flash
in
the
pan
head
that
recedes
to
nothing
after
only
a
couple
of
seconds
the
aroma
is
a
bit
medicinal
and
metalic
with
just
a
touch
of
fruity
bread
the
taste
is
a
moldy
wheat
beer
with
a
strong
fig
and
very
light
plum
essence
would
be
pretty
good
without
the
moldy
taste
the
is
very
fleetin
no
lingering
but
what
does
linger
is
some
on
the
verge
of
going
bad
fruits
that
lingers
a
bit
wont
buy
this
beer
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
certainly
well
brewed
and
nice
if
youre
craving
the
taste
i
am
if
you
come
across
it
dont
be
afraid
of
it
not
being
a
top
100
beer
this
is
one
of
a
limited
number
of
weizenbocks
that
ive
come
across
only
one
of
the
top
five
most
reviewed
w
bocks
is
a
full
time
offering
aventinus
and
it
matches
note
for
note
just
lacks
that
special
something
the
beer
was
moderatly
thick
and
oily
for
a
bock
which
i
thought
was
odd
in
the
end
i
could
drink
this
all
day
maybe
its
because
its
atleast
5
or
6
months
old
or
maybe
because
its
just
a
different
flavor
than
im
used
to
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
poured
this
ugly
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
a
gold
color
with
a
fine
white
bibbly
head
that
almost
instantly
fell
away
to
nothing
no
lacing
whatsoever
either
the
smell
was
sour
which
scared
me
the
tase
was
a
bit
sweet
and
a
complex
mix
of
fruit
taste
with
a
strange
undescribable
after
taste
i
did
not
care
for
it
and
will
not
buy
again
i
couldnt
tell
if
this
was
a
weizenbock
or
apple
cider
it
looks
like
a
dark
unfiltered
wheat
beer
but
it
leaned
heavily
towards
the
sweet
side
sweet
like
well
apple
cider
a
little
bit
of
clove
danced
around
in
the
background
yet
the
taste
wasnt
bad
at
all
and
it
had
a
pretty
good
drinkability
for
its
strength
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
that
would
wow
me
mouthfeel
is

bodied

in
a

it
pours
a
ruddy
amberbrown
with

and
a

the
bouquet
is

clove
the
flavor
builds
on
this
by
adding
some
tarttangy
wheat
papaya
chocolate
and
grassy
leafygreen
hops
on
top
of
a
lightmedium
body
that
has
a
similar
finish
and
imparts
a
tingly
effervescence
overall
a
yeasty
phenolic
and
tropical
wheat
beer
that
is
unique
and
tasty
of
the
five
kaufbeuren
beers
ive
sampled
st
blasius
is
easily
the
best
fairly
sweet
tasting
that
accentuates
a
finish
that
has
a
solid
weizenlike
clove
flavor
this
beer
has
a
light
carbonation
to
it
that
adds
a
bit
of
zest
to
the
middle
of
this
beer
flavors
of
apple
cider
both
sweet
hard
varieties
are
perhaps
one
of
the
most
noticeable
flavors
the
finish
is
marred
by
a
touch
of
vegetal
flavors
and
perhaps
a
phenolics
note
that
is
a
bit
beyond
clove
this
is
really
not
all
that
good
the
flavors
as
well
as
the
palate
seem
washed
out
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
that
i
cant
really
see
myself
coming
back
to
d
not
something
i
would
have
again
its
certainly
worth
a
try
but
currently
there
are
several
much
better
weizenbocks
available
d
not
spectacular
but
easily
drinkable
lighter
consistency
but
still
pretty
potent
in
alcohol
therefore
maybe
not
one
you
could
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
good
flavors
and
aroma
one
id
probably
have
again
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
the
beer
appears
a
dank
light
brown
color
some
orangishyellowish
tint
at
the
base
lots
of
carbonation
a
decent
twofinger
head
forms
after
pouring
but
quickly
dies
down
leaving
a
thin
layer
of
foam
coating
over
the
whole
beer
not
much
lace
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
a
sparkling
and
fruity
i
detect
strong
notes
of
peach
with
some
banana
apple
and
pear
a
buttery
crust
sensation
is
there
as
well
a
wonderful
aroma
overall
i
could
smell
this
all
day
long
the
taste
is
equally
as
pleasant
smooth
maltiness
mixes
well
with
the
fruity
overtones
there
is
some
piney
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
it
serves
more
as
a
clean
finish
than
a
detractor
mouthfeel
is
chewy
but
not
syrupy
very
solid
i
could
easily
make
this
a
session
beer
the
7
2
abv
is
masked
well
perhaps
too
well
and
i
could
very
easily
find
myself
downing
three
or
four
of
these
in
a
setting
given
the
chance
what
a
nice
beer
drinkability

i
enjoyed
the
way
this
one
felt
in
the
mouth
which
is
an
accomplishment
in
and
of
itself
but
the
rest
of
it
left
me
wanting
i
wouldnt
buy
again
poured
a
murky
mediumbrown
color
with
a
pillowlike
whitecolored
head
the
head
was
rather
frothy
with
a
soaplike
consistency
lowcarbonation
and
quite
cloudy
at
a
glance
aromas
of
honey
fruit
and
grains
very
breadlike
smell
the
taste
followed
suit
with
a
strong
grain
flavor
followed
by
fruity
undertones
slightly
chewy
in
my
mouth
overall
this
was
a
flavorful
beer
and
quite
easy
to
sip
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
another
d
very
smooth
not
nearly
as
complicated
and
intense
as
aventinus
this
could
be
a
weizenbock
session
beer
if
there
is
such
a
thing
nice
without
being
too
sweet
or
overbearing
overall
its
a
decent
weizenbock
but
there
are
better
not
that
its
not
brewed
well
because
it
is
but
just
because
some
others
have
achieved
a
higher
level
of
balance
still
its
worth
trying
if
it
was
easier
to
find
id
recommend
it
as
a
gateway
beer
the
weakest
weizenbock
ive
ever
had
it
wasnt
bad
it
just
didnt
pack
a
punch
at
all
cloudy
amber
in
color
head
foams
up
quickly
even
with
a
correct
pour
then
fades
to
about
a
half
inch
where
it
stays
throughout
this
beer
does
adhere
to
the
reinheitsgebot
law
of
german
beer
this
is
a
good
weizenbock
for
someone
who
is
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
bock
that
would
pair
well
with
most
meals
phenolic
characteristics
fade
as
the
beer
stays
in
the
glass
i
paid2
79
at
hollingshead
overall
not
that
bad
but
a
little
boring
in
the
long
run
poured
a
cloudy
golden
body
with
large
head
and
some
lace
that
stuck
around
and
has
an
aroma
that
is
citric
and
spice
with
faint
yeastorange
twang
beer
is
smooth
easy
to
drink
the
yeast
is
there
and
adds
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
fluff
in
the
beer
also
get
hints
of
tropical
fruits
but
mostly
a
citric
hoppy
body
mixed
with
spice
to
bastardize
as
done
before
imagine
your
typical
wheat
beer
with
extra
hops
pretty
good
and
had
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
it
hit
the
spot
o
i
can
see
why
some
people
would
really
like
this
beer
as
it
is
a
melange
of
different
flavors
but
they
dont
fit
together
well
for
me
with
too
much
yeast
character
and
a
strange
interplay
between
the
estery
nature
of
the
beer
and
the
citrusy
and
floral
american
hopping
overall
awesome
beer
not
sure
if
it
follows
the
style
as
it
comes
off
more
as
some
sort
of
hoppy
american
wheat
ale
we
stopped
at
multiple
breweries
on
the
brew
ridge
trail
and
this
is
the
one
beer
that
blew
me
away
it
sucked
when
i
went
inside
the
brew
house
to
buy
some
bottles
to
find
out
they
only
have
it
on
draft
if
you
like
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
or
the
wild
version
you
will
love
this
a
good
straight
forward
version
draft
on
the
brewpub
porch
dreally
nice
i
always
like
a
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
flavours
working
together
and
this
one
has
it
a
bit
of
a
burly
kid
though
at
almost
8
but
its
well
hidden
and
isnt
noticed
at
all
well
done
experimental
beer
as
the
brewery
notes
call
it
drinkability
blue
mountains
best
beer
yet
in
my
opinion
the
nearly
8
abv
doesnt
even
make
an
appearance
the
melding
of
the
american
hops
and
the
german
yeast
notes
is
fantastic
the
beer
is
gorgeous
this
is
really
just
an
impressive
impressive
beer
nice
dark
malts
and
banana
bubblegum
flavors
very
nice
drinkable
beer
at
7
7
o
damn
good
top
3
or
4
weizenbocks
for
me
sad
i
could
only
have
one
local
weizenbock
for
the
win
may
order
another
in
the
next
five
minutes
the
feel
is
excellent
rich
and
silky
theres
a
nice
active
bite
of
crispness
that
contributes
with
the
wheat
in
the
medium
body
and
a
tight
carbonation
to
form
a
very
nice
and
lasting
smoothness
a
warm
aroma
and
even
warmer
flavor
a
recognizable
alcohol
presence
exploding
with
typical
weizen
flavors
like
clove
and
banana
easily
drinkable
with
a
smooth
finish
but
some
linger
as
one
would
expect
from
a
dunkelweiss
or
weizenbock
as
fat
heads
brewery
describes
this
brew
it
is
a
more
fullbodied
weizen
bier
dark
in
color
with
a
noticeable
body
mmmmmmm
overall
like
the
wheat
wine
i
am
also
impressed
with
their
ability
to
make
a
very
drinkable
weizenbock
recommended
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
dark
fruit
and
a
mellow
wheat
presence
in
the
taste
small
dry
dark
fruit
and
a
nice
presence
of
banana
in
the
end
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
banana
dark
fruit
like
aftertaste
nice
presence
of
dry
banana
to
mix
with
the
dark
fruit
pours
a
hazed
light
brown
aroma
of
bubblegum
banana
and
clove
in
the
taste
heavy
on
the
banana
alittle
spice
and
alcohol
burn
pretty
much
estery
yeast
giving
off
the
banana
flavors
which
is
the
one
dimensional
yet
very
nice
flavor
profile
some
brown
sugar
caramel
and
more
banana
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
smooth
overall
a
nice
brew
sure
to
please
any
wheat
fan
o
one
of
the
better
weizenbocks
that
i
have
tasted
nicely
blended
flavors
that
you
would
expect
would
certainly
enjoy
this
on
a
crisp
fall
evening
o
a
very
drinkable
and
great
tasting
weizenbock
i
would
get
this
one
again
if
i
did
not
want
head
hunter
ipa
all
night
d
not
too
many
weizenbocks
out
there
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
easily
drinkable
every
beer
from
fat
heads
has
been
a
pleasant
surprise
so
far
do
really
good
for
a
beer
at
this
abv
point
i
will
most
likely
drink
3
weizen
glasses
full
and
enjoy
them

upon
initial
wafting
of
beer
to
nose
it
was
a
bit
underwhelming
banana
fumes
yeasty
malt
and
some
mild
citrus
not
bad
smelling
just
not
overpowering
upon
tasting
this
growlered
nectar
i
got
a
nice
spicy
taste
with
the
corresponding
tastes
as
found
in
the
aroma
maltiness
yeastiness
bread
biscuit
some
caramel
malt
became
more
prevalent
at
the
end
of
the
taste
not
too
bad
but
nothing
overwhelming
decent
body
and
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
plenty
of
carbonation
with
a
slight
amount
of
lingering
bitterness
while
not
wowed
in
tasted
this
beer
was
rather
drinkable
pours
a
hazy
copperbrown
with
a
good
offwhite
head
and
some
good
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
glass
the
nose
brings
forward
a
strong
clove
presence
with
a
bit
of
bubble
gum
banana
and
malt
in
the
background
strong
yeasty
components
throughout
some
dark
fruits
are
present
in
the
taste
along
with
quite
a
bit
of
clove
and
spicy
yeast
a
bit
too
much
brownsugar
however
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
rich
with
a
bit
of
booze
altogether
a
pretty
solid
beer
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
d
solid
all
around
hitting
all
the
typical
looks
smells
and
tastes
of
the
style
not
much
unique
about
it
though
there
doesnt
need
to
be
another
solid
beer
from
an
up
and
coming
brewery
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
kiss
of
carb
really
good
for
the
style
some
lingering
wheat
sweetness
and
bubblegum
and
raisin
linger
this
is
a
kickass
american
stab
at
one
of
the
greatest
most
perfect
beers
ever
in
my
opinion
aventinus
but
the
beer
falls
just
a
touch
short
and
the
flaws
make
it
a
disappointment
considering
the
fat
heads
hefe
is
just
amazing
still
worth
a
tick
er
trip
the
first
brew
i
have
had
from
these
guys
that
didnt
absolutely
blow
me
away
with
quality
and
originality
not
to
say
it
isnt
really
good
but
just
that
it
lacks
that
oh
my
goodness
element
the
others
have
had
its
essentially
a
big
strong
wit
with
all
the
fruity
esters
you
expect
from
such
a
yeast
strain
tons
of
wheat
malt
body
and
even
sweetness
and
then
a
lemongrassy
hop
finish
thats
cool
for
the
style
but
lost
to
the
fragrance
and
potency
of
the
yeast
just
a
bit
its
delicate
too
though
for
being
so
robust
its
just
the
sweetness
hits
a
wall
mid
way
and
then
the
yeast
seems
naked
the
alcohol
doesnt
show
though
making
this
a
dangerously
easy
drinking
brew
i
like
the
belgian
intensity
but
its
not
unique
from
others
like
it
a
well
made
beer
overall
with
a
cool
mouthfeel
but
maybe
a
half
step
behind
the
best
they
have
to
offer
ogreat
flavors
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
as
it
was
billed
as
an
imperial
wheat
ale
better
with
a
little
less
sweetness
but
overall
really
enjoyed
it
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
excellent
aroma
while
it
is
quite
heavy
and
fusel
from
the
get
go
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
the
depth
of
the
spice
keeping
it
even
and
nicely
balanced
throughout
actually
with
warmth
it
even
became
fruitier
further
sweetening
any
residual
bitterness
to
compare
the
flavoring
was
also
quite
nice
but
we
felt
they
overdid
it
a
bit
in
regards
to
how
belgian
it
was
as
we
were
expecting
more
of
a
dirty
unfiltered
american
imperial
wit
instead
there
were
heavier
syrups
and
sugars
and
a
unmistakably
belgian
yeast
this
is
not
to
say
it
wasnt
good
but
rather
just
took
us
for
a
bit
of
a
surprise
additionally
the
lack
of
creaminess
and
foamy
froth
made
things
seem
unfinished
as
they
would
have
helped
soften
the
edges
either
way
this
was
a
strong
tasty
beer
and
something
you
should
definitely
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
wheat
overall
another
hit
from
kuhnhenns
in
my
opinion
they
are
too
rare
and
a
touch
to
expensive
but
they
do
know
how
to
make
beer
o
i
normally
look
at
a
weiz
as
a
refreshing
summer
drink
but
this
is
a
bit
intense
for
the
90
degree
day
ill
have
just
one
as
i
didnt
love
it
as
first
however
this
grew
on
me
as
i
sipped
it
as
most
big
beers
do
and
im
kind
of
digging
it
much
more
however
still
rather
boozy
served
in
a
tulip
glass
a
dull
goldenorange
color
opaque
with
haze
and
a
tiny
ringlet
of
head
that
disappeared
completely
within
seconds
lots
of
soft
fruit
and
clovey
spice
in
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
and
laden
with
banana
perhaps
more
so
than
ive
ever
had
in
a
beer
bready
yeast
wheat
clove
and
pepper
light
pear
and
apricot
that
are
mostly
eclipsed
by
the
banana
mildly
subtle
citrus
hops
in
the
finish
smooth
and
fairly
chewy
body
is
heavier
than
medium
drinkable
but
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
good
but
i
doubt
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
a
gold
to
orange
body
head
disappeared
on
the
way
to
my
table
aromas
of
light
sugars
spices
and
citrus
flavors
of
wheat
lemon
apples
cloves
and
alcohol
the
body
was
qquite
hin
for
the
alcoholsugar
attributes
of
this
beer
quite
sweet
enjoyable
drink
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
its
a
very
light
straw
colored
brew
a
little
cloudy
bright
white
head
stays
with
this
all
the
way
down
aroma
of
wheat
and
citrus
is
easy
to
pick
up
tastes
also
of
wheat
and
grapefruit
mild
bodied
slightly
carbonated
and
refreshing
very
tasty
beer
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
thanks
my
firend
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
i
was
really
impressed
the
beer
held
great
complexity
and
depth
super
bright
and
fresh
flavors
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
lots
of
citrus
pepper
sweet
malts
spicy
yeast
and
light
candies
crisp
body
really
exceptional
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
cloudy
yellowish
golden
color
with
a
little
white
head
on
it
the
aromas
of
malts
fresh
grains
and
some
spices
the
taste
followed
through
with
these
same
elements
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
also
the
overall
view
of
this
beer
that
i
have
is
that
it
was
good
but
just
didnt
spark
my
interest
all
that
much
my
friend
brought
home
a
growler
her
enjoyed
it
that
much
i
just
wasnt
able
to
get
into
this
one
too
much
but
it
was
worth
trying
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
definitely
worth
trying
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
it
was
actually
pretty
decent
it
has
some
nice
flavors
but
lacked
in
the
nose
i
liked
all
the
lemon
flavors
fairly
drinkable
as
well
bottle
pours
a
hazed
orange
amber
color
with
very
minimal
head
what
head
i
can
muster
is
a
off
white
color
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
hints
of
peach
apricot
and
pear
mixed
with
some
spice
notes
like
spearmint
mediumlight
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
way
different
than
i
thought
it
would
be
with
an
almost
lemon
like
sournesstartness
almost
like
a
lemon
smarties
after
the
tartness
subsides
a
subtle
wheat
like
base
pulls
through
some
alcohol
presence
makes
itself
known
as
well
lingering
apricot
flavor
very
different
but
very
tasty
id
pass
if
offered
again
d
for
its
strength
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
making
this
beer
very
drinkable
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
as
it
was
fruity
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
goes
down
pretty
easy
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
big
wit
bier
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
weizenbock
the
combination
of
a
wheat
beer
and
9
5
alcohol
doesnt
work
for
me
visually
it
was
a
very
light
color
with
a
lot
of
good
carbonation
the
aroma
is
very
wheatlike
and
good
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
the
alcohol
is
a
little
heavy
handed
which
would
lower
the
drinkability
for
me

love

so
you

this
one
was
quite
enjoyable
nice
to
find
this
one
available
and
fresh
on
tap
at
my
local
pours
a

16

of

poor

and
poor

smells
of
herbs
orange
peel
yeast
sweet

and
more
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
weizenbock
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
coriander
orange
peel
yeast
slight
hop
and
herbs
overall
good
body
and
aroma
had
again
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
and
tasty
fruity
wheat
d
im
not
generally
the
biggest
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
was
phenomenal
and
the
rather
high
abv
was
nowhere
near
detectable
a
great
beer
from
kuhnhenn
mouthfeel
is
very
good
with
moderate
carbonation
a
little
heavy
malt
presence
on
the
palate
and
with
a
clean
finish
that
leaves
just
a
touch
of
residual
sugar
to
keep
some
flavor
going
without
being
cloying
quite
easy
to
drink
for
nearly
10
overall
a
great
beer
and
one
that
kuhnhenn
should
make
widely
available
d
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
is
not
typically
a
style
i
seek
out
this
is
an
extremely
wellcrafted
imperial
wit
thats
serirously
drinkable
for
the
abv
its
definitely
sweet
with
lots
of
fruit
but
the
spiciness
balances
it
well
as
ive
said
before
the
kuhnhenn
bottles
ive
had
that
werent
infected
are
generally
outstanding
taste
again
is
heavy
clove
followed
by
some
sweet
banana
peaches
and
orange
this
is
put
together
really
well
and
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
awesome
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
its
an
interesting
beernot
unpalatable
certainlybut
its
a
little
too
much
along
several
axes
and
a
little
not
enough
along
others
the
mouthfeel
is
somehow
both
a
bit
syrupy
and
a
bit
thin
the
prominence
of
the
chocolate
exaggerates
as
the
beer
warms
and
sits
with
you
and
while
there
is
a
hint
of
banana
from
the
yeast
on
the
nose
theres
much
more
than
a
hint
of
the
yeast
in
the
beer
itself
still
terrapin
admits
this
side
project
22
is
clearly
a
hoax
of
a
rendition
of
the
style
so
some
deviations
are
forgivable
nonetheless
it
seems
the
addition
of
cocoa
nibs
and
orange
peel
for
a
greater
depth
of
flavor
failed
to
actually
provide
much
depth
of
flavor
beyond
big
orange
and
thick
cacao
notes
so
its
hard
to
be
especially
enthused
about
this
moonray
o
this
was
a
fairly
ugly
beer
with
tons
of
yeast
floaters
not
a
dealbreaker
there
but
needs
to
be
pointed
out
the
flavors
were
decent
but
neither
the
chocolate
nor
orange
had
the
large
presences
i
expected
it
also
lacked
some
of
the
clean
lager
flavor
appeal
that
makes
the
weizenbock
a
good
style
an
interesting
concept
but
i
feel
like
the
execution
could
have
been
better
overall
a
very
tasty
and
pretty
unique
beer
lots
of
dark
beer
character
but
still
remains
light
and
slightly
refreshing
fully
captures
what
it
claims
to
be
with
good
orange
and
chocolate
flavor
with
the
full
effect
of
the
weizenbbock
a
great
intro
to
the
side
project
series
for
me
overall
a
good
beer
good
take
on
a
weizenbock
o
i
was
a
little
doubtful
as
the
weizenbock
is
not
in
my
top
10
styles
but
adding
orange
is
an
awesome
twist
with
a
side
of
sugar
oneat
concept
but
the
chocolate
and
orange
dont
come
through
well
enough
which
leaves
it
a
bit
too
sour
for
a
weizenbock
perhaps
an
odd
concept
but
ive
got
to
give
props
the
beer
is
exactly
what
it
says
it
is
a
weizenbock
with
an
orange
chocolate
character
intriguing
bold
and
tasty
i
tried
a
cask
of
this
beer
with
vanilla
at
terrapins
anniversary
fest
and
didnt
like
it
all
tried
again
on
tap
a
few
weeks
later
and
really
enjoyed
it
it
pours
orange
and
is
very
light
in
texture
it
was
very
sweet
with
a
strong
orange
taste
until
the
end
where
you
get
the
chocolate
it
did
get
a
little
stale
tasting
after
the
finish
an
interesting
experiment
and
departure
from
the
style
that
ultimately
didnt
do
it
for
me
thin
and
overly
bitter
without
near
enough
sweetness
to
balance
chocolate
orange
weizenbocks
arent
really
turning
out
to
be
the
best
idea
after
all
stick
to
the
germans
they
wont
do
you
wrong
overall
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
cellared
terrapin
gamma
ray
aka
bananas
foster
in
beer
form
but
with
a
touch
of
coco
and
orange
on
the
front
end
not
a
bad
thing
in
any
way
but
definitely
possessive
of
a
clear
delineation
feel
medium
body
with
medium
soft
carbonation
overall
though
drinks
well
with
a
bit
of
an
interesting
fun
angle
decent
and
enjoyable
i
would
have
this
again
serving
type
bottle
ok
but
probably
not
worth
the
price
its
pretty
much
like
a
chocolate
porter
also
when
i
poured
out
the
rest
of
the
bottle
i
noticed
a
lot
of
sediment
and
large
chunks
of
something
maybe
its
orange
peel
perhaps
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
and
this
contributed
to
my
meh
attitude
towards
this
beer
overall
a
soso
weizenbock
decent
flavor
but
just
a
bit
too
sweet
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
balanced
carbonation
lingers
in
your
mouth
but
overall
not
bad
just
average
o
i
was
a
little
doubtful
as
the
weizenbock
is
not
in
my
top
10
styles
but
adding
orange
is
an
awesome
twist
with
a
side
of
sugar

o
a
unique
but
weird
beer
that
veers
too
far
from
the
weizenbock
style
for
me
the
citrus
is
too
strong
and
overpowers
the
basic
elements
of
the
style
the
chocolate
is
a
nice
touch
and
alone
would
probably
work
pretty
well
with
the
style
who
doesnt
like
chocolate
banana
bread
this
beer
has
some
potential
but
needs
to
leave
out
the
citrus
o
nothing
to
go
bat
crazy
about
its
almost
like
lets
throw
some
stuff
at
a
weizenbock
and
see
what
sticks
pours
into
my
weizenbock
glass
a
deep
murky
chestnut
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
light
beige
head
atop
that
left
a
frothy
mass
as
it
settles
slowly
some
brown
sugar
and
banana
in
the
nose
but
nothing
that
makes
you
say
wowa
bit
of
roasted
chocolate
beans
is
there
as
well
the
chocolate
plays
a
big
role
on
the
palate
and
it
goes
well
with
some
of
the
spiced
phenols
the
orange
comes
into
play
late
giving
a
juicy
finishas
i
drink
more
it
stands
out
more
this
beer
is
pretty
cool
with
its
different
flavorsdo
i
like
ityeah
i
do
but
its
different
in
a
good
way
really
unique
beer
maybe
a
little
too
much
carbonation
which
creates
a
foamy
mouthfeel
but
that
about
the
only
negative
for
me
lots
of
banana
and
orange
chocolate
up
front
id
say
banana
is
the
second
flavor
you
get
and
orange
appears
in
the
middle
and
finishes
stronger
ill
definitely
try
to
get
some
more
of
this
one
before
its
gone
one
of
a
kind
beer
overall
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
cellared
terrapin
gamma
ray
aka
bananas
foster
in
beer
form
but
with
a
touch
of
coco
and
orange
on
the
front
end
this
beer
really
deserves
some
props
very
unique
the
name
is
inviting
and
it
delivers
the
chocolate
is
quite
prevalent
with
mostly
dark
chocolate
notes
the
orange
is
on
the
back
and
smoothes
over
the
beer
nicely
with
a
great
aftertaste
easy
to
take
a
bomber
to
the
head
one
of
my
favorites
by
terrapin
fantastic
job
overall
a
fantastic
and
welcome
surprise
from
the
oldest
and
one
of
the
finest
german
breweries
a
pleasant
surprise
a
fantastic
beer
to
repeat
amazing
it
tastes
exactly
like
their
hefeweizen
except
it
has
more
alcohol
you
can
barely
tell
the
difference
since
it
is
well
hidden
it
definately
doesnt
drink
like
its
7
7
if
more
stores
carried
this
i
would
buy
it
more
often
taste
is
as
they
say
subjective
and
this
may
not
be
the
most
beautiful
or
the
best
looking
beer
but
the
aroma
is
fantastic
and
the
taste
imho
wasis
amazing
o
very
tasty
wheat
beer
that
is
definitely
stronger
than
the
average
the
7
7
abv
is
mostly
hidden
in
the
taste
but
you
can
feel
it
early
on
classic
wheat
beer
notes
of
banana
with
a
little
spice
in
it
the
sweetness
is
very
restrained
this
is
the
perfect
beer
poured
into
teku
glass
a
beautiful
cloudy
lemon
yellow
with
a
substantial
pure
white
head
that
lasts
aroma
of
melon
lemon
bread
yeast
and
hard
candy
taste
follows
closely
to
the
smell
concentrating
on
the
melon
and
tart
citrus
with
a
sweet
finish
mouth
is
really
nice
medium
body
fairly
high
carbonation
refreshing
and
pure
overall
delicious
my
fist
taste
of
a
weizenbock
and
im
sure
it
wont
be
my
last
well
made
enjoyable
weizenbock
wow
flavour
wheaty
robust
with
a
light
spice
at
the
end
there
are
light
grapefruit
notes
with
some
bite
from
the
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
enjoyable
o
tremendous
it
deserves
the
high
marks
it
gets
its
simple
in
nature
but
complex
at
the
same
time
the
blend
of
flavor
is
well
executed
its
aesthetically
pleasing
and
it
is
just
an
excellent
seasonal
beer
sessionable
no
doubt
one
i
will
be
getting
whenever
available
around
the
holidays
had
it
at
the
brewery
with
my
lunch
delicious
read
others
notes
if
you
want
nuances
subtle
notes
etc
im
not
eloquent
enough
or
my
palate
not
refined
enough
but
i
know
what
i
like
and
i
like
this
a
lot
when
i
drink
this
for
some
reason
it
reminds
me
of
drinking
allagashs
tripel
ale
just
so
drinkable
delicious
and
has
me
wanting
more
if
you
want
an
american
beer
with
this
drinkability
check
that
out
amazing
beer
would
prefer
something
darker
but
this
beer
is
a
great
example
of
this
style
o
color
was
very
light
for
the
style
didnt
get
any
of
the
dark
fruit
character
i
expected
overall
a
very
middling
beer
nothing
particular
i
would
recommend
about
it
other
than
its
almost
8
abv
and
a
low
price

i

it
has
a
taste
quality
consistency
and
depth
of
color
taste
and
smell
that
is
not
encountered
often
in
the
world
it
is
a
distinct
beer
the
beer
as
it
warms
from
the
refrigerator
releases
more
subtle
flavor
and
richness
of
taste
this
is
a
beer
for
special
occasions
and
a
reward
for
a
job
well
done
malty
bready
taste
sweet
with
allspice
flavour
expected
it
to
be
a
bit
darker
in
color
but
everything
else
was
superb
this
isnt
a
style
im
well
acquainted
with
or
particularly
enjoy
but
it
is
definitely
a
solid
brew
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
tons
of
active
bubbles
feeding
ahead
that
has
some
serious
staying
power
lacing
seemed
spotty
at
first
but
became
absolutely
coating
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
aromas
are
big
with
banana
clove
pear
apple
and
hints
of
cinnamon
taste
is
fruity
and
spicy
with
banana
and
clove
coming
through
immediately
with
some
lighter
notes
of
pear
and
tart
apple
mouthfeel
starts
creamy
and
carbonated
finishes
dry
and
lets
the
fruity
flavors
linger
this
is
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
great
drinking
beer
o
ive
read
about
this
one
for
years
and
just
happened
upon
it
at
my
local
bottle
shop
ive
definitely
been
missing
out
ill
actively
seek
this
beer
again
i
should
have
grabbed
another
bottle
or
two
as
refreshing
as
a
hefeweizen
but
bold
and
hearty
enough
to
be
more
enjoyable
during
the
winter
months
5
liter
bottle
poured
into
weissbier
glass
produced
a
lovely
three
finger
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
took
about
5
minutes
to
recede
faded
to
about
a
quarter
inch
that
lasted
to
the
end
nice
lacing
the
color
is
a
cloudy
goldenyellow
with
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
continually
refreshing
the
foam
the
smell
is
fantastic
with
lots
of
bready
yeast
prominent
filled
in
by
great
banana
bubblegum
and
clove
aromas
one
of
the
best
beer
aromas
out
there
the
taste
was
nearly
identical
to
the
smell
however
the
banana
flavors
really
came
out
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
too
with
a
touch
of
clovey
bubblegummy
goodness
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
kinda
chewy
almost
with
a
bit
of
the
prickly
carbonation
that
lets
you
know
youve
got
something
special
here
this
is
such
an
outstanding
beer
and
for
the
price
world
class
three
full
fingers
worth
of
audibly
fizzy
crisp
tightly
compact
perfectly
uniform
bone
whit

turns
a
bit
rocky
on
the
top
and
small
large
carbonation
bubbles
emerge
as
this
one
settles
a
bit
excellent
retention
the
color
is
a
slightly
murky
hazed
deep
rich
amber
a
light
bit
of
sluggish
to
moderate
paced
carbonation
a
big
rich
nose
dominated
by
wheat
yeast
honey
and
candied
sugars
there
is
a
potent
fruitiness
about
in
the
form
of
pear
and
apple
theres
also
a
subtle
musky
funkiness
that
lingers
in
the
nose
as
well
a
big
rich
flavor
profile
that
is
identical
to
the
aroma
with
perhaps
a
slight
addition
of
some
overly
ripened
banana
theres
also
a

bodied

slightly
chewy
good
balance
a
very
enjoyable
beer
all
the
way
around
regardless
of
the
style
perfect
in
any
season
and
for
any
occasion
just
a
rock
solid
example
of
world
class
brewing
craftsmanship
o
a
really
delicious
wheat
beer
full
of
huge
fruit
and
malt
flavours
vitus
is
another
winner
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
i
could
drink
this
ale
all
day
paid
less
than
3
for
a
pintsized
bottle
at
local
grocer
at
that
price
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
valueperquality
beers
out
there
i
honestly
dont
know
what
it
is
about
this
beer
but
it
is
damn
near
perfect
in
my
book
it
has
a
crispy
fruity
mouth
taste
and
it
just
gets
more
complex
the
mouth
feels
is
bubbly
and
playful
i
hope
that
makes
sense
its
a
complex
beer
that
drinks
easy
a
feat
that
for
me
is
hard
to
find
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
minute
or
two
wonderful
nose
of
bananas
and
citrus
crisp
clean
flavor
with
a
hint
of
bananas
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
at
the
finish
creamy
mouth
feel
with
all
the
great
reviews
you
dont
need
me
to
tell
you
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
tastes
smells
and
looks
like
a
buff
heifewiezen
cloudy
gold
with
a
minimal
and
quickly
disappearing
head
the
smell
is
banana
clove
lemon
and
bubblegum
but
tempered
by
a
stron
malt
backbone
this
one
is
pretty
smooth
for
the
abv
quite
a
tasty
treat
o
understated
but
classy
not
much
more
to
add
be
a
masterpiece
overall
an

overall
a

which
uses
a

overall
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
and
undoubtedly
the
most
complex
german
beer
ive
had
in
my
minimal
experience
with
german
beers
some
of
the
typical
wheat
and
banana
flavors
from
a
hefeweizen
but
the
malt
has
more
layers
to
it
starting
off
dry
and
switching
to
softersweeter
malt
flavors
the
carbonation
settles
down
as
this
warms
up
which
adds
points
for
me
and
booze
pretty
much
disappears
with
warmth
too
definitely
a
beer
id
revisit
but
id
probably
prefer
the
classic
weihenstephaner
hefe
the
majority
of
times
over
this
91100
overall
a
very
flavorful
weizen
that
hides
its
strength
well
drinkable
refreshing
and
flavorful
i
could
easily
have
had
another
one
if
there
would
have
been
more
in
my
fridge
will
surely
have
this
one
again
overall
a
beer
that
should
please
any
palate

another

i

this
1
pint
0

fl
oz
bottle
for
2

at
a
local
grocery
store
i
am
going
back
for
more
this
beer
was
just
out
of
this
world
good
a
taste
from
my
german
heritage
and
a
near
perfect
beer
to
boot
a
superb
wheat
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
creamy
head
and
the
nose
is
the
classic
lemon
and
banana
the
taste
is
unique
and
surprising
starts
creamy
sweet
and
finishes
even
sweeter
not
over
the
top
but
enough
to
let
you
know
that
has
a
bock
influence
and
separates
itself
from
the
classic
wheat
beer
they
brew
body
is
on
the
light
side
reminds
me
of
the
rockcandy
like
taste
you
get
in
a
belgian
dubbel
overall
very
soft
on
the
pallet
with
sweet
nip
this
wheat
beer
bagged
itself
the
wba
best
wheat
beer
award
in
2012
drink
a
bottle
and
you
will
see
why
fragrant
with
a
hint
of
plum
this
beer
is
an
absolute
cracker
and
although
strong
at
7
7
it
does
not
feel
like
a
heavy
beer
at
all
very
similar
to
the
hefeweissbier
only
stronger
and
with
less
of
a
banana
nose
worldclass
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
for
3
99
at
the
grocery
store
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
deals
on
import
beer
in
the
united
states
overall
its
really
just
a
strong
hefe
a
bock
hefe
oddly
enough
i
like
it
far
more
than
i
like
weihenstephaner
hefeweizen
its
clove
and
spice
are
more
subdued
and
balanced
the
alcohol
content
makes
it
dangerous
because
it
is
so
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
virtually
undetectable
it
goes
down
as
easy
as
a
light
hefe
but
reminds
you
of
the
extra
alcohol
at
the
end
dont
let
the
fruitiness
fool
you
its
got
a
kick
o
best
german
wheat
beer
ive
had
the
banana
strength
in
the
taste
made
this
brew
genuinely
enjoyable
to
drink
even
if
it
was
alcohol
free
having
said
that
it
is
a
strong
beer
in
terms
of
abv
and
it
goes
down
to
easily
so
be
careful
before
gulping
this
down
odelicious
nicely
brewed
o
a
gorgeously
crafted
beer
by
all
accounts
if
you
like
the
spicy
flavors
clove
in
particular
this
is
a
must
try
for
the
style
this
is
amazing
i
just
dont
care
for
the
style
nothing
to
complain
about
this
beer
unsurprisingly
solid
but
unexceptional
but
as
always
difficult
to
rate
a
beer
that
hits
its
style
on
point
is
it
average
or
the
standard
beautiful
brew
excellent
fruity
yeasty
esters
banana
and
pear
highlights
along
with
a
nice
balancing
act
of
nutty
bready
honey
sweet
malts
and
clove
spice
fruity
crisp
and
refreshing
finishes
with
a
nice
flavorful
drying
quality
overall
the
impression
is
one
of
a
merealbeit
delicioushefeweizen
with
a
greater
alcohol
content
it
really
doesnt
seem
bocklike
at
all
which
is
the
only
aspect
that
i
can
find
fault
with
almost
perfect
pours
from
the
bottle
a
hazy
light
gold
with
a
creamy
white
head
sustained
by
the
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
filled
with
wheat
banana
cloves
and
spice
cardamom
creamy
wheat
and
bread
predominate
the
taste
but
you
get
plenty
of
fruit
and
spice
too
medium
silky
mouth
just
a
superb
beer
rjt
indelibly
delectable
pours
a
lovely
light
straw
the
color
white
if
wine
only
hay
and
with
fat
head
of
white
foam
that
falkls
slowly
enough
the
nose
is

the
stuff
your
grandmother
is
putting
in
a
pie
apple
skin
baked
pear
light
banana
clove
honey
spice
a
bit
of
cinnamon
oh
my
stars
the
taste
is
luscious
ripe
and
succulent
fruit
l
the
apple
skin
crisp
and
light
the
pear
baked
and
sweet
together
with
the
clove
the
honey
malt
the
tall
and
crisp
whet
malt
that
stands
in
the
glass
like
a
strange
sentinel
golden
glowing
flaky
like
flakes
in
the
cereal
bowl
but
sweet
and
soft
too
oh
the
banana
light
ans
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
fruity
crisp
creamy
well
carbonated
and
this
finishes
dry
and
with
so
much
fruit
you
cannot
stand
to
believe
its
not
under
a
pie
crust
o
this
beer
rocks
the
house
the
flavors
are
off
the
charts
and
the
beer
is
just
in
your
face
delicious
my
dad
absolutely
loves
this
beer
and
now
i
see
why
o
hard
to
describe
how
intricate
this
beer
is
almost
a
cognaclike
thing
happening
which
is
probably
from
a
magical
combination
of
the
wheat
and
malts
an
interesting
big
weizen
again
why
have
i
not
tried
this
before
really
liked
give
it
a
try
i
began
the
pour
only
to
be
be
surprised
by
its
light
color
i
do
not
know
why
i
was
thinking
that
it
would
be
dark
in
color
but
i
was
startled
all
the
same
i
got
a
dense
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
as
a
result
color
was
a
pretty
sunshineyellow
srm

with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
like
a
hefeweizen
especially
in
terms
of
the
banana
esters
although
i
got
some
clove
but
accompanied
by
a
bit
of
heat
i
was
ready
to
sneeze
mouthfeel
was
medium
i
initially
thought
to
myself
hefeweizen
burned
again
since
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
then
the
heat
kicked
in
and
i
realized
why
this
was
a
winter
beer
bananas
heat
bananas
foster
man
i
really
dug
it
in
advanced
foods
in
homeec
when
we
did
flambe
desserts
hit
the
lights
get
some
fire
going
and
serve
in
this
case
i
was
getting
ready
to
hit
the
deck
it
was
like
a
rabbit
punch
i
did
not
see
this
coming
despite
the
label
finish
was
dry
mainly
thanks
to
its
inherent
heat
phew
sabbath
plays
on
while
i
may
be
played
out
overall
excellent
taste
and
aroma
very
boozy
though
overall
i
think
ive
found
a
beer
i
can
go
to
in
any
situation
here
its
value
is
unmatched
at
3
bucks
a
bottle
it
may
not
be
fresh
but
this
beer
holds
up
im
glad
this
is
easily
found
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
and
what
the
heck
was
i
waiting
for
to
try
this
overall
just
what
i
expected
out
of
this
brewery
and
this
beer
excellence
all
around
the
horn
the
germans
have
this
brewing
thing
down
pat
and
it
is
difficult
for
anyone
to
compete
with
them
at
least
in
my
opinion
while
we
americans
do
have
the
ipa
market
locked
up
i
firmly
believe
that
if
you
are
looking
for
an
excellent
wheat
beer
look
no
further
than
a
german
or
belgian
brewery
o
a
premium
example
of
the
style
at
a
nonpremium
price
of
3
50
what
a
steal
ashevilles
bier
garden
isnt
the
first
place
i
suggest
to
have
a
beer
when
in
town
but
they
sneak
in
some
nice
specials
here
and
there
and
have
a
very
decent
selection
picked
this
up
at
a
great
beer
shop
in

cloudy

pour
with
a
two
finger
foamy
pure
white
head
with
decent

and
lacing
the
nose
is
classic
weizen
with
spicy
wheat
up
front
along
with
hints
of
banana
clove
lemon
caramel
yeast
and
grass
the
taste
is
bold
spicy
and
extremely
rich
with
lots
of
sweet
caramel
malt
along
with
hints
of
banana
bread
lemon
clove
pear
apple
cider
yeast
and
grass
the
mouthfeel
is
really
thick
and
chewy
with
perfect
carbonation
and
a
nice
tangy
finish
overall
this
is
definitely
the
most
flavorful
weizen
ive
ever
had
having
lived
in
germany
for
13
years
and
only
recently
revisiting
weizens
im
kicking
myself
ive
really
become
a
big
fan
of
these
beers
and
will
definitely
stock
up
on
this
gem
great
example
of
the
style
cheers
120512
on
tap
a
truly
great
beer
as
long
as
youre
not
expecting
a
hop
extravaganza
to
me
this
is
a
great
version
of
a
true
old
world
style
forget
all
the
bs
drink
this
stuff
i
guess
since
they
have
been
at
it
since
725
ad
they
have
it
together
o
extremely
satisfying
and
delicious
so
well
made
i
love
the
opponent
but
this
was
a
close
winner
with
the
more
impressive
aggressive
potent
aroma
carrying
the
day
like
a
festive
white
bread
infused
with
spices
and
fruit
thats
what
this
beer
is
o
i
really
like
the
lack
of
bitterness
in
the
taste
which
is
very
pleasant
so
overall
just
a
nice
tasting
beer
o
a
great
refreshing
beer
as
a
hefe
should
and
does
not
feel
strong
on
the
sips
very
balanced
indeed
definitely
not
my
favorite
style
so
im
trying
to
be
fair
to
it
this
is
clearly
a
well
made
beer
and
after
analyzing
it
more
closely
i
needed
to
do
the
right
thing
and
review
to
increase
my
original
rating
overall
delicious
i
have
no
complaints
o
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
my
first
experience
with
a
weizenbock
and
this
did
not
disappoint
highly
recommended
o
an
excellent
example
of
a
traditional
weizenbock
that
only
weihenstephaner
can
pull
off
this
beer
sets
the
standard
for
strong
wheat
beers
it
is
refreshing
and
smooth
with
a
combination
of
flavours
that
compliment
but
dont
dominate
the
yeasty
wheat
base
dark
yellow
in
color
with
a
light
amber
hue
and
a
heavy
haze
poured
with
a
huge
billowly
white
foam
that
slowly
reduced
grainy
wheat
light
corriander
fresh
pear
and
banana
aromas
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
spicy
tanginess
through
the
middle
that
smooths
at
the
end
wheat
bread
pear
and
banana
flavors
up
front
with
peppery
spice
through
the
middle
bready
malt
and
banana
flavors
at
the
end
as
this
finishes
dry
and
crisp
a
beer
with
a
ton
of
character
in
every
category
pours
a
hazy
honey
in
color
with
about
a
2finger
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
and
sides
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
lots
going
on
with
the
aroma
as
there
is
wheat
yeast
cloves
citrus
and
even
banana
the
taste
is
complex
as
well
with
the
spices
of
clove
nutmeg
and
sweet
banana
mixing
well
with
the
wheat
and
biscuit
yeast
perfect
carbonation
and
goes
down
so
easy
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
either
i
guess
the
oldest
brewery
1040
a
d
has
figured
out
how
to
make
some
great
brews
over
the
years
and
nailed
it
bright
golden
hued
with
great
clarity
a
tightly
knit
inch
thick
head
of
white
foam
brussels
lacing
seriously
enticing
aroma
of
banana
and
sourdough
bread
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
dry
the
front
of
the
palate
is
sourdough
bread
and
is
quickly
followed
by
the
banana
flavor
that
fades
back
to
a
more
subtle
sourdough
bread
fade
excellent
price
point
for
the
quality
of
this
beer
would
definitely
put
this
on
rotation
as
a
go
to
springsummer
beer
o
4
75
this
beer
has
so
much
potential
to
be
sickeningly
sweet
and
cloying
but
it
completely
avoids
that
and
blends
all
the
flavors
of
a
german
bock
beer
in
a
way
thats
so
good
youll
never
want
to
touch
an
american
wheat
beer
again
o
outstanding
while
i
do
enjoy
a
hefeweizen
this
style
and
beer
are
more
up
my
alley
a
bit
more
bite
but
well
balanced
a
must
try
a
complex
beer
of
the
old
guard
that
doesnt
have
to
punch
you
in
the
mouth
to
get
its
point
across
this
is
a
tasty
wheat
beer
with
hints
of
banana
flavor
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
musty
dirtlike
aroma
the
7
7
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
overall
a
fantastic
weizenbock
again
this
one
is
like
a
boozedup
version
of
the
normal
hefeweizen
but
remains
incredibly
balanced
it
tastes
and
drinks
much
like
weihenstephaners
normal
hefeweizen
but
you
can
definitely
feel
the
difference
a
fantastic
world
class
brew
and
one
that
i
highly
recommend
for
wheat
beer
lovers
mf
medium
bodied
semidry
finish
4
this
is
an
outstanding
weizenbock
and
for
a
weizen
its
a
big
big
bier
clocking
in
at
7
7
it
drinks
perfectly
clean
and
tasty
definitely
one
of
the
best
german
wheat
beers
ive
ever
had
consider
it
a
musttry
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
the
vitus
is
good
but
its
not
in
my
favorite
lane
there
is
much
clove
in
the
scent
and
in
the
taste
the
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
big
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
big
carbonation
overall
its
a
good
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
have
tried
it
but
i
would
go
for
the
other
weihenstephen
offerings
before
going
to
this
one
o
awesome
example
of
the
style
with
such
a
smooth
balance
but
noticeable
strength
you
get
transported
to
old
world
germany
with
this
beer
must
try
this
beer
if
you
like
a
flavorful
wheat
beer
overall
just
an
extremely
well
executed
beer
from
top
to
bottom
not
really
a
hint
of
the
big
abv
except
for
slight
slickness
on
the
palate
but
i
actually
enjoy
that
element
of
the
mouthfeel
o
top
of
the
line
weizenbock
the
wheat
dominates
but
the
bock
end
doesnt
come
through
as
much
i
had
hoped
o
extremely
worthy
of
its
ratings
and
high
praise
the
abv
flys
under
the
radar
and
has
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
excellent
beer
overall
i
havent
had
this
in
a
while
and
i
forgot
how
good
it
was
did
i
mention
that
all
this
goodness
is
only
3
50
or
less
at
most
places
too
more
please
yet
another
great
beer
from
these
guys
i
love
the
variety
of
flavors
and
aromas
that
it
presents
o
watch
out
no
hint
of
alcohol
hidden
behind
banana
and
citrus
flavors
this
is
a
boozy
spring
drink
for
me
i
think
it
is
perfect
for
marchapril

then

is
good
overall
a
very
good
beer
quite
strong
in
abv
but
no
cloying
alcohol
taste
it
starts
out
with
a
slight
bite
almost
a
barley
wine
bite
and
then
quickly
lets
the
flavors
come
out
citrus
filled
at
first
blush
then
sets
in
with
a
buttery

the
color
is
simply
beautiful
a
dark
honey
appearance
that
you
cannot
see
through
with
a
light
powdery
foam
head
that
settles
but
laces
little
and
has
no
glass
cling
although
my
favorite
beer
from
weihenstephaner
is
the
traditional
hefe
weissbeir
the
vitus
is
a
close
second
try
it
then
enjoy

been
more

aroma
is
mostly
all

very
earthy
and
some

so
damn
refreshing
big

and
the
banana
underneath
excellent
the
look
is
almost
murky
on

of
the
ultracloudy

is
a
huge
frothy
head
that
stayed
the
course
the
smell
is
overwhelmingly
banana
and
seems
just
like
warm
banana
bread
the
taste
is
more
complex
but
harder
to
put
my
finger
on
it
i
picked
up

one
of
the

of
the
wheat

from
this

ive
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
ones
interesting

progression
with
a
pleasant
play
of
lightly
sweet

dry
elements
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
spicing
is
deftly
done
one
of
the
worlds
great
beers
sometimes
i
wish
there
wouldnt
be
so
many
interesting
beers
to
sample
so
i
could
drink
weihenstephaner

of

wheat
lemon
zest
and
hints
of
citric

lactic

some
orange

as
well
the

some

the

lively
with
a
wet
but
refreshing
finish
a
touch
of
clove
and
citrus
linger
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
a
personal
favorite
the
clove
predominance
combined
with
a
bit
of
a
beefier
mouthfeel
compared
to
the
hefeweisse
makes
it
a
wonderful
variation
of
another
excellent
weihenstephaner
offering
well
balanced
rich
in
complexity
and
a
superb
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
weizenbock
so
im
not
exactly
sure
what
this
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
like
this
beer
has
that
belgian
sour
taste
that
i
enjoy
so
much
the
malt
is
also
prominent
other
flavors
include
fruit
and
spice
what
a
complex
delicious
brew
i
guess
i
like
weizenbocks
o
this
is
really
a
great
beer
and
the
price
is
right
too
definitely
something
i
will
be
drinking
again
o
crisp
and
refreshing
for
the
summer
heavy
enough
for
colder
months
an
all
around
great
beer
overall
i
love
this
style
and
brewery
its
definitely
nothing
mind
blowing
or
even
anything
id
probably
ever
go
out
f
my
way
to
find
but
beers
like
this
hold
a
special
place
in
my
heartpalette
every
once
in
awhile
i
like
to
brake
away
from
american
hop
bombs
and
go
back

i
have
really
started
to
appreciate
these
nice
and
easy
drinking
classic
german
brews
that
weihenstephaner
makes
cheap
too
good
stuff
get
it
o
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
for
my
palate
if
the
taste
were
just
a
bit
less
sweet
or
possibly
a
touch
more
bitter
to
balance
the
sweetness
it
would
be
almost
all
5s
either
way
this
bottle
cost
only
3
and
for
the
price
i
would
challenge
anyone
to
do
better
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
its
a
touch
boozy
but
thats
understandable
the
balance
of
smells
and
flavors
the
feel
the
whole
package
unlike
most
beers
as
i
mentally
dissect
it
im
even
more
impressed
by
it
weihenstephaner
is
in
my
opinion
the
king
of
wheat
beers
and
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
o
just
a
wonderful
weizenbock
the
banana
esters
and
velvety
mouthfeel
make
what
should
be
a
boozy
brew
very
drinkable
1010
will
drink
again
o
tasty
beer
my
first
time
trying
it
and
i
was
impressed
to
say
the
least
yeah
like
rauls
dentist
recommends
raul
wouldnt
mind
having
a
vitus
two
times
a
day
a
delicious
brew
and
highest
marks
very
easy
to
drink
i
like
that
as
i
approach
the
end
the
beer
is
still
flavorful
some
hefes
tend
to
wash
out
or
go
flat
as
they
warm
a
very
good
beer
o
absolutely
delicious
i
paired
it
with
a
knockwurst
overall
i
would
call
this
a
great
weizenbock
in
my
little
experience
with
the
style
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
for
a
drinkable
beer
with
an
above
average
alcohol
content
truly
a
testament
to
the
brewing
practices
of
germany
very
challenging
beer
like
many
of
this
style
still
a
rewarding
one
i
would
only
put
schneiders
aventinus
above
vitus
for
this
style
surprisingly
long
shelf
life
so
dont
worry
too
much
about
the
best
by
date
overall
absolutely
delicious
this
beer
is
so
flavorful
and
smooth
its
hard
to
believe
this
brew
wasnt
spiked
with
a
bunch
of
fruit
or
spices
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
ive
ever
had
and
its
not
that
expensive
to
boot
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
think
i
prefer
the
straight
up
hefeweizen
from
weihenstephan
better
but
this
is
a
tasty
example
of
a
style
that
is
hard
to
find
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
onefinger
frothy
white
head
wonderful
aroma
of
citrus
banana
and
clove
the
taste
is
right
in
line
with
the
smell
strong
yeast
flavors
that
really
bring
out
the
banana
and
spice
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
was
spot
on
dry
finish
a
delicious
beer
very
similar
to
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
that
is
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelves
had
this
a
few
times
and
am
a
big
fan
wanted
to
do
a
full
review
to
see
how
the
score
holds
up
outstanding
looking
beer
although
not
quite
to
the
level
of
hefe
or
dunkel
pretty
much
the
same
with
the
smell
and
taste
very
similar
but
not
quite
the
same
but
still
very
high
quality
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
like
very
much
but
have
a
hard
time
taking
it
over
the
hefe
or
dunkel
pours
a
bright
yellow
cloudy
colour
you
can
actually
see
the
haze
forming
distinct
patterns
in
the
cloudy
ale
crazy
the
smell
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
its
grainy
like
an
adjunct
lager
the
taste
is
a
whole
different
animal
though
the
grain
flavours
are
so
light
that
they
are
taken
over
by
strong
notes
of
banana
cloves
citrus
peel
and
spices
are
there
spices
in
this
beer
the
notes
are
so
strong
that
i
would
suspect
so
these
arent
all
what
im
looking
for
in
a
weizenbock
typically
but
it
makes
for
an
excellent
allaround
brew
no
question
im
used
to
a
dominating
banana
note
and
a
bite
from
a
weizenbock
this
has
the
banana
but
too
much
orange
peel
and
it
completely
lacks
any
bite
which
disappoints
me
a
little
the
flavour
of
this
beer
is
typical
of
old
world
traditional
brews
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
abbey
ale
those
are
good
so
i
cant
rate
this
particularly
poorly
i
was
really
looking
for
more
bite
in
my
weizenbock
though
prost
this
is
an
amazing
world
class
beer
i
absolutely
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
wheat
oriented
ales
with
intense
banana
flavor
o
good
beer
no
complaints
about
it
o
i
was
detracted
from
the
high
level
of
sweetness
that
i
found
this
beer
to
have
generally
a
good
beer
but
it
seems
not
as
well
crafted
as
some
of
their
others
their
hefe
is
tiptop
shelf
but
this
falls
short
worth
a
try
but
i
will
likely
pass
unless
in
a
share
from
my
tasting
notes
it
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
nice
full
creamy
head
and
plenty
of
citrus
on
the
nose
the
taste
had
the
signature
german
wheat
beer
tastes
of
banana
sweet
candy
and
a
bit
of
citrus
the
vitus
had
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
that
spoke
to
its
craftsmanship
and
elegantly
balanced
tasting
experience
this
was
a
great
weizenbock
and
one
that
surprised
me
a
bit
as
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
the
vitus
is
a
beer
to
look
for
and
one
that
will
pleasantly
surprise
any
beer
lover
light
body
with
ample
crisp
carbonation
that
refreshes
the
tongue
with
each
sip
a
classic
weizenbock
that
shows
real
depth
and
real
class
in
the
mouthfeel
and
use
of
hefe
notes
and
the
deeper
darker
aspects
of
the
bock
i
cant
really
find
much
to
fault
in
this
beer
for
the
style
as
it
is
redolent
of
bananas
and
dark
fruit
with
a
luscious
mouthfeel
that
really
makes
you
want
the
beer
never
to
end
o
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
its
full
bodied
and
has
some
kick
behind
it
it
has
a
nice
complexity
to
it
while
not
going
over
the
top
as
it
is
in
my
opinion
that
some
of
these
weizenbocks
are
a
bit
too
intense
with
the
flavors
the
beer
is
well
balanced
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
also
it
is
a
great
deal
for
an
import
with
a
higher
abv
at
only
around
34
a
bottle
o
i
was
thoroughly
pleased
with
this
one
it
was
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
a
great
beer
through
and
through
solid
in
every
category
o
paid
2
99
for
a
22oz
bottle
going
back
to
buy
the
rest
the
taste
surprised
me
and
i
cannot
wait
to
have
another
this
has
so
many
elements
to
it
and
theyre
all
woven
together
really
nicely
complex
spiciness
with
an
earthy
element
bold
but
balanced
and
tons
of
intricacies
make
this
a
real
pleasure
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
awhile
enough
tartness
to
counter
the
creaminess
and
still
has
a
lot
of
liveliness
to
it
and
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
4

this
pour
is
ridiculous
it
looks
like
a
hazy
apricot
colored
hefe
with
this
billowing
head
that
wont
give
up
looks
great
and
the
label
announces
that
it
has
been
dubbed
the
wba
12
worlds
best
wheat
beer
strong
a
golden
orange
glow
weizenbock
eh
im
in
the
aromatics
hints
of
sliced
fresh
apple
baked
bread
hints
of
clove
and
fruit
esters
this
beer
hides
the
alcohol
quite
well
flavor
coats
the
sides
of
the
palate
with
ample
sweetness
sturdy
alcohol
in
the
backend
hints
of
green
apple
ripened
banana
and
spicy
clove
accents
this
beer
has
some
girth
to
it
definitely
a
strong
alcohol
presence
the
more
it
warms
but
its
well
woven
into
a
comfortable
wheat
beer
setting
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
glissade
bock
sierra
nevada
used
to
make
except
this
is
a
stronger
wheat
version
of
that
style
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
cloying
mid
way
through
each
sip
even
keeled
carbonation
enough
to
carry
the
beer
along
medium
to
full
but
yet
comes
of
drinkable
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
overall
a
perfectly
good
strong
wheat
beer
from
germany
got
it
in
a
gift
pack
for
15
99
with
5
beers
and
a
glass
thats
value
overall
probably
my
second
favorite
weizenbock
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
nightcap
that
is
very
refined
and
light
look
no
further
than
vitus
made
by
german
brewing
royalty
overall
superb
again
being
my
first
weizenbock
im
not
sure
what
the
standard
is
but
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
sweet
but
not
cloying
the
abv
makes
itself
known
but
is
far
from
overpowering
if
anything
it
makes
you
take
your
time
and
enjoy
this
is
no
doubt
too
sweet
for
some
but
if
you
like
witbiers
or
hefedunkelweizens
you
will
love
this
this
is
an
incredible
beer
i
couldnt
get
enough
of
it
i
wanted
more
more
more
a
slow
sipper
as
it
might
be
a
bit
sweet
for
some
but
otherwise
beautifully
balanced
and
full
of
character
do
yourself
a
favor
get
one
or
ten
o
just
an
outstanding
brew
from
top
to
bottom
and
a
perfect
way
to
kick
off
a
day
of
oktoberfest
celebrating
o
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
german
classic
and
it
did
not
disappoint
it
was
a
joy
to
drink
and
at
about
3
50
a
bottle
i
have
a
feeling
ill
be
drinking
it
again
soon
vitus
is
a
very
nice
paler
take
on
the
usually
darker
wheat
bock
imagine
a
more
flavorful
version
of
weihenstephaners
topnotch
hefeweizen
and
youve
got
vitus
overall
great
beer
spicyer
than
i
originally
thought
but
really
enjoy
it
and
the
beer
as
a
whole
definitely
gonna
get
more
i
love
the
lingerings
of
this
beer
vitus
is
probably
my
favorite
from
weihenstephaner
oi
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
so
my
scores
are
pretty
high
however
i
question
how
true
to
style
this
thing
is
because
although
this
is
a
delicious
beer
it
lacks
any
hint
of
the
typical
chocolate
or
dark
malts
or
dark
fruit
instead
this
is
essentially
an
imperial
hefe
or
at
least
a
beefed
up
hefe
with
more
flavor
and
alcohol
but
damn
if
it
aint
good
back
up
the
trucks
and
stock
up
the
fridge
great
classic
beer
a
favorite
savor
it
and
enjoy
they
had
a
500
year
head
start
on
rheinheitsgebot
imagine
what
they
can
produce
in
the
next
millennium
as
above
the
best
beer
from
an
a
brewery
game
changer
what
can
i
say
weihenstephaner
does
it
again
the
beer
is
god
damn
ridiculous
its
just
a
wheaty
spicy
clovey
masterpiece
with
a
slight
hint
of
banana
but
not
enough
to
gross
me
out
because
i
hate
bananas
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
tripel
its
a
masterpiece
i
would
drink
this
literally
everyday
it
doesnt
exactly
have
the
appearance
that
i
prefer
a
bit
too
yellow
and
clear
but
that
doesnt
matter
at
all
its
just
a
wonderful
wonderful
beer
wonderful
this
brewery
is
just
genius
disappointing
since
this
is
rated
so
highly
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
bottle
it
is
like
a
tunedup
hefeweizen
on
booze
and
toasted
malts
very
very
good
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
welcome
to
first
class
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
weihenstephaner
beers
but
i
think
that
it
just
must
be
the
beer
styles
lagers
whatever
that
i
dont
like
because
i
can
tell
that
this
is
exemplary
of
its
style
flavorful
and
a
full
bouquet
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
o
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
overall
a
very
very
good
beer
here
not
quite
as
good
as
their
hefeweissbier
but
still
a
definite
must
try
d
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
one
of
the
best
weizenbocks
i
have
had
overall
another
phenomenal
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
must
try
o
it
is
an
excellent
beer
nothing
could
beat
aventinus
but
this
is
a
quality
cheaper
substitute
vitus
just
fantastic
stuff
but
be
careful
this
beer
is
much
to
easy
to
drink
with
a
high
abv7
7
i
like
this
better
than
aventinus
but
obviously
you
cant
go
wrong
with
either
one
o
relaxing
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
with
a
deceptive
flavors
delicious
90
pours
a
hazy
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
very
thick
creamy
white
head
has
the
look
of
a
great
wheat
ale
lots
of
banana
coriander
and
bubble
gum
in
the
nose
im
also
getting
some
faint
clove
very
nice
smelling
wheat
taste
is
killer
huge
flavorful
wheat
thats
just
dry
enough
but
not
overly
so
clean
and
crisp
alcohol
is
a
little
noticeably
but
that
entirely
fine
with
me
this
brewery
has
it
down
pat
theyve
had
enough
time
and
time
pays
off
overall
weihenstepehaner
is
one
of
the
worlds
gerat
breweries
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
them
this
is
basically
a
stronger
version
of
their
hefe
absolutely
phenomenal
so
much
estery
flavoring
but
the
malt
backbone
balances
excellently
very
refreshing
and
hides
the
high
alcohol
content
well
until
the
warmth
settles
in
wheat
beers
arent
my
favorite
but
this
is
delicious
overall
nice
balanced
weizenbock
but
the
ripe
darker
fruits
contribute
a
slight
sickly
flavor
that
keeps
this
from
being
as
first
class
as
i
expected
overall
another
winner
from
this
remarkable
brewery
not
a
style
i
enjoy
as
a
rule
but
this
example
won
me
over
the
alcohol
was
not
prominent
but
it
had
an
effect
for
sure
oda
neat
beer
i
had
no
idea
what
vitus
had
in
store
for
me
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
unique
like
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
or
even
a
tripel
but
i
find
the
wheat
base
to
balance
and
smooth
out
the
flavors
well
worth
a
try
at
less
than
3
a
bottle
o
first
time
having
vitus
and
ill
be
seeking
it
out
again
so
drinkable
and
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
is
as
good
as
it
gets
overall
really
excellent
beer
as
far
as
im
concerned
weihenstephaner
makes
the
best
wheat
beers
in
the
world
as
far
as
wheat
beers
go
this
is
one
of
the
best
there
is
overall
a
beer
which
for
me
is
swimming
in
dichotomies
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
mix
all
that
well
but
the
toasted
malt
going
up
against
the
esters
is
both
true
to
style
and
worth
witnessing
if
you
havent
had
this
type
of
beer
before
a
beer
that
could
grow
on
me
i
would
certainly
like
to
try
it
again
further
down
the
road
overall
a
really
great
classic
german
weizenbock
great
balance
of
bready
wheat
spices
and
fruit
esters
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
overall
really
great
stuff
perfect
for
this
hot
summer
day
overall
i
think
this
is
the
first
weizenbock
that
i
have
had
but
it
will
not
be
the
last
i
really
love
the
german
wheat
beers
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
glad
i
pushed
my
boundaries
and
tried
something
i
normally
wouldnt
definitely
would
drink
again
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
did
enjoy
it
but
not
as
much
as
their
dunkelweizen
o
each
category
grew
weaker
as
i
progressed
through
the
review
which
basically
mirrored
my
experience
drinking
it
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
might
be
better
consumed
on
a
crisp
fall
day
but
on
this
warm
summer
evening
it
was
a
bit
much
for
me
would
absolutely
drink
again
but
would
choose
the
hefeweizen
10
out
of
10
times
ahead
of
this
one
a
fantastic
summer
afternoon
quencher
yea
you
want
to
sit
out
in
the
sunshine
to
enjoy
this
yet
this
would
be
great
all
year
long
as
a
great
change
of
pace
a
superb
brew
overall
brilliant
beer
this
world
class
its
no
wonder
weihenstephaner
has
been
around
for
millions
of
years
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
i
think
the
regular
hefeweizen
is
the
better
beer
it
still
packs
a
flavor
punch
but
has
a
lower
abv
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
superior
still
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
i
could
have
a
few
glasses
of
this
anytime
beautiful
pour
my
favorite
shade
of
gold
mouthfeel
is
delightfully
lacking
in
tartness
like
most
weizenbocks
the
taste
was
better
than
id
expected
not
too
sweet
with
a
richness
that
comes
out
over
time
definitely
one
to
savor
so
far
i
would
say
this
is
the
most
impressive
of
weihenstephaner
brews
overall
a
brilliant
wheat
beer
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
overal
very
very
tasty
has
a
nice
banana
character
to
it
but
then
fades
a
little
quickly
no
alcohol
detected
prost
lampertland
in
my
opinion
weihenstephaner
makes
some
of
the
best
wheat
beers
of
the
world
you
are
looking
at
a
high
abv
on
this
however
you
do
not
taste
it
unless
warm
tastes
like
banasoranges
citrus
but
well
designed
wheat
bock
refreshing
tasteful
and
if
the
right
glass
is
used
and
it
is
well
poured
a
great
experience
overall
an
interesting
beer
o
not
knocking
the
beer
as
its
a
good
beer
just
not
really
my
style
i
wont
buy
in
a
bottle
again
but
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
overall
i
cant
wait
to
buy
more
weihenstephan
has
been
around
for
a
million
years
for
a
reason
they
make
excellen
beer
this
was
truly
amazing
very
highly
recommended
if
you
want
a
classic
weizenbock
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
had
a
good
german
beer
cant
imagine
a
much
better
way
to
get
back
into
the
lovely
brews
of
the
rhineland
than
with
this
vitus
weizenbock
very
pleased
a
very
nice
very
drinkable
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
and
has
a
lot
of
flavor
to
it
very
much
a
summer
beer
it
is
light
and
flavorful
good
head
dies
down
to
thin
layer
all
across
the
top
minimal
straggling
of
lacing
light
golden
color
sort
of
a
deeper
version
of
the
color
of
pear
flesh
small
bit
of
haze
nose
has
a
nice
scent
of
pears
but
theres
also
something
there
that
makes
me
think
of
soap
which
is
a
bit
offputting
tastes
of
pears
and
cloves
hint
of
banana
as
it
warms
and
the
soapy
smell
thing
isnt
apparent
on
the
tongue
feels
good
better
than
i
expected
i
was
expecting
something
thinner
and
thought
obviously
not
a
stout
my
preferred
style
it
has
a
good
feel
oh
and
the
soapy
smell
issue
seems
to
go
away
a
bit
as
it
warms
feel
free
to
comment
if
you
have
more
info
on
that
vvv
iii
ttt
uuu
sss
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
balanced
and
complex
i
really
enjoy
this
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
one
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
out
again
but
wouldnt
refuse
if
offered
to
me
a
classic
beer
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
i
would
have
to
say
that
their
korbinian
is
still
my
favorite
with
this
one
a
close
second
ill
be
watching
many
a
mlb
game
this
summer
while
enjoying
a
few
of
these
o
my
favorite
beer
perfectly
crafted
and
can
be
drunk
at
any
time
of
year
ive
drank
it
on
the
beach
on
the
summer
and
also
warmed
up
with
it
at
christmas
time
i
can
say
ive
tasted
a
significant
selection
of
some
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
and
this
one
blows
them
all
away
overall
das
bier
ist
gut
really
not
much
can
be
the
consistency
of
weihenstephaner
theyre
quality
is
great
and
its
a
steal
given
the
price
well
worth
a
try
500ml
bottle
hazy
golden
colored
ale
topped
with
a
huge
rocky
white

that
holds
its
retention

and
sweet
aroma
with
banana

some

huge
full

super
creamy
and
smooth
this
is
definitely
a
loaf
of
bread
but
its
so
good
topnotch
an
exemplary
demonstration
of
the
brewers
art
looks
great
with
a
fantastic
aromaflavour
that
is
true
to
style
yeast
esters
dominate
yet
blend
perfectly
with
the
malt
and
wheat
characteristics
smooth
velvety
body
a
true
classic
its
easy
to
see
why
it
is
held
in
high
esteem
i
dont
often
score
beers
so
highly
but
this
worldclass
brew
deserves
the
praise
add
this
to
your
musttry
list
o
this
is
an
epic
beer
full
of
amazing
flavors
and
with
a
great
mouthfeel
warning
extreme
drinkability
o
among
the
best
in
my
book
i
love
it
id
drink
it
all
summer
if
it
were
readily
available
to
me
it
will
be
on
hand
at
my
place
for
sure
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
to
date
and
at
the
price
point
it
is
a
must
try
if
you
have
yet
to
experience
it
easy
drinker
for
both
bas
and
those
who
have
not
yet
come
over
from
the
dark
side
of
the
force
cheers
love
this
brewer
and
their
beers
this
is
just
another
excellent
example
from
them
perfect
flavors
and
balance
though
i
do
like
their
darker
bocks
a
bit
more
incredible
beer
for
the
price
o
im
shocked
that
this
beer
is
7
7
abv
because
it
drinks
much
easier
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
a
top
class
weizenbock
though
not
as
strong
as
some
others
overall
yes
this
is
excellent
stuff
a
timely
reminder
of
how
good
weihenstephaner
are
i
love
experimentation
and
crazy
craft
formulations
but
we
should
always
remember
the
more
traditional
extreme
beers
this
is
a
fine
example
of
how
to
make
something
big
and
exciting
but
also
keep
everything
in
balance
love
it
o
overall
it
was
a
solid
german
beer
although
nothing
spectacular
would
make
a
good
summer
beer
id
have
it
again
overall
decent
but
the
thick
mouthfeel
taste
of
alcohol
and
metallic
notes
keep
it
from
being
great
for
me
mouthfeel
medium
plus
body
creamy
and
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
o
an
excellent
weizenbock
heavier
flavors
than
the
heffe
with
more
of
an
alcohol
presence
the
banana
flavor
is
most
pronounced
like
the
original
hefe
better
for
its
understated
subtle
complexity
but
this
one
is
great
too
its
an
amped
up
hefeweizen
with
huge
similarities
the
carbonation
makes
smooth
and
give
it
a
medium
body
clean
finish
while
i
would
recommend
schneider
weisse
aventinus
this
is
still
exceptional
its
actually
a
different
animal
as
it
doesnt
have
the
dark
color
and
roasted
malt
of
aventinus
this
one
leaves
me
begging
for
more
this
would
be
dangerous
on
a
hot
day
so
easy
to
drink
and
offering
thirst
quenching
qualities
great
flavors
and
well
rounded
deserving
of
its
top
250
status
d
a
good
beer
but
i
really
am
not
sure
of
the
difference
between
this
and
a
hefe
slightly
bigger
body
but
i
am
not
getting
the
bock
presence
i
expected
to
get
regardless
still
a
good
beer
just
misleading
a
pale
weizenbock
that
i
find
myself
comparing
to
gutmann
weizenbock
but
gutmanns
version
is
far
sweeter
and
heavier
which
puts
it
one
step
below
vitus
o
this
is
a
great
weizenbock
by
far
one
of
the
best
ive
had
o
it
is
good
for
the
style
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
the
beer
is
hazy
and
apricot
hued
with
an
inch
of
white
head
the
aroma
brings
banana
clove
spice
like
a
stronger
hefe
with
more
sweetness
and
alcohol
the
flavor
offers
a
heavy
dose
of
sweet
bananas
booze
wheat
while
this
is
good
i
much
prefer
the
standard
weihenstephaner
hefe
medium
bodied
with
mild
warmth
in
the
finish
pretty
good
o
very
well
put
together
beer
one
of
my
favorite
styles
for
sure
and
definitely
purchase
one
in
the
future
not
to
rich
like
many
complex
belgians
but
just
the
perfect
amount
of
fruit
coupled
with
spot
on
carbonation
for
me
just
about
perfect
reminds
me
of
delerium
tremens
without
the
richness
final
thoughts
its
weishenstephaner
if
you
havent
accepted
the
fact
they
are
the
undisputed
kings
of
wheat
beer
you
are
living
under
a
rock
another
solid
offering
by
them
and
well
worth
trying
highly
recommended
this
poured
out
as
a
hazy
golden
color
the
head
is
white
with
a
pretty
good
retention
but
not
much
lacing
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
fruity
aroma
along
the
lines
of
peach
and
banana
really
fresh
smelling
beer
the
taste
is
also
fruity
apple
there
is
some
bready
yeast
flavors
and
a
subtle
spice
note
in
the
finish
i
do
get
a
slight
metallic
flavor
that
im
not
digging
too
much
hoping
that
fades
as
it
warms
up
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
very
smooth
with
a
decent
carbonation
overall
its
a
good
brew
i
can
see
why
the
score
is
so
high
on
this
one
because
it
really
is
a
great
beer
awesome
flavors
and
really
enjoyable
o
very
good
hefeweizen
higher
abv
gives
it
a
nice
creamy
mouth
feel
along
with
typical
sweet
citrus
and
spices
initially
overflowed
the
bottle
real
quick
when
poured
the
beer
is
american
cheese
orange
with
a
solid
quilt
of
fine
creamy
foam
smells
of
clove
butter
wheat
shortbread
nice
nose
flavor
is
rich
with
wheat
a
touch
of
nougat
some
banana
spices
corn
and
a
hint
of
bread
full
bodied
with
tight
hi
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
cant
understand
how
ive
missed
out
on
this
one
best
weizenbock
ive
had
stylistically
perfect
weizenbock
pours
cloudy
gold
glowing
brightly
with
a
lasting
two
or
more
inches
of
thick
white
foam
the
nose
is
slight
banana
yeast
sturdy
wheat
malt
base
some
subtle
sugar
and
an
alcohol
kick
the
flavor
is
so
balanced
with
a
mild
hop
finish
that
gels
with
the
yeast
just
right
huge
dose
of
german
wheat
malt
is
the
perfect
backdrop
for
this
drink
and
it
takes
me
like
the
hefe
they
make
to
somewhere
else
bavaria
back
in
the
day
or
something
its
traditional
classy
and
strong
actually
the
alcohol
seems
higher
than
necessary
and
gives
this
beer
maybe
some
extra
weight
slowing
drinkability
just
a
tad
good
late
winter
or
early
spring
drink
perfect
with
some
fresh
pretzels
and
actually
stood
up
well
to
salmon
on
the
grill
overall
a
top
notch
version
of
the
style
and
you
absolutely
cannot
beat
the
price
under
four
bucks
per
bottle
o
very
nice
and
refreshing
more
full
bodied
than
other
wheat
beers
ive
had
a
pleasant
surprise
o
worldclass
from
start
to
finish
vitus
explosive
aroma
draws
you
right
in
pressing
past
the
foam
for
the
first
sip
of
the
classic
yeastrich
german
brew
this
fullflavored
and
deceptively
light
weizenbock
goes
down
all
too
easily
it
looks
like
ive
found
one
of
my
new
favorite
easy
to
find
german
beers
o
and
absolutely
delightful
beer
id
probably
love
it
even
more
during
the
summer
on
the
patio
this
reminded
me
of
new
glarus
dancing
man
wheat
which
is
fantastic
this
might
even
be
a
little
better
i
cant
recommend
this
one
enough
o
very
good
beer
not
has
wheaty
as
most
weizenbocks
i
have
had
but
plenty
of
flavor
overall
weihenstephan
has
yet
again
produced
a
well
balanced
brew
there
may
be
one
or
two
better
weizenbocks
out
there
but
this
is
still
a
world
class
beer
not
a
surprise
but
once
again
another
good
weihenstephaner
beer
just
a
good
weizenbock
overall
a
really
great
beer
i
bought
a
couple
of
on
recommendation
of
the
salesman
at
the
local
shop
really
sits
well
on
a
slightly
warmer
winter
night
where
i
wasnt
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
or
porter
pours
a
cloudy
light
amber
yellow
with
substantial
head
aroma
is
similiar
to
the
hefeweizen
but
more
so
delicious
brew
with
orange
citrus
and
pear
banana
fruitiness
lighter
than
the
other
weizenbocks
i
have
had
but
still
top
notch
i
consider
vitus
the
light
version
of
the
german
weizenbocks
i
find
it
particularly
good
after
an
aerobic
workout
while
the
draft
version
is
exceptional
in
the
bottle
is
also
excellent
and
readily
available
in
the
northeast
this
was
my
first
weizenbock
and
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
i
had
wehenstephaners
hefeweizen
last
night
and
this
is
comparable
except
it
was
more
cloudy
in
appearance
and
you
can
definitely
taste
and
feel
the
stronger
abv
overall
it
is
kind
of
like
a
souped
up
hefeweizen
or
maybe
like
a
hefenweizengrand
cru
hybrid
it
is
great
tasting
and
potent
but
very
drinkable
rather
well
done
o
overall
a
fantastic
weizenbock
i
do
not
have
a
ton
of
experiences
in
this
style
but
definitely
like
what
i
am
seeing
in
this
one
final
grade
4
54
an
impressive
a
vitus
is
easily
one
of
this
brewerys
finest
creations
and
probably
one
of
the
best
weizenbocks
available
anywhere
as
much
as
i
love
aventinus
ive
got
to
admit
i
kind
of
like
this
stuff
a
bit
more
this
brew
is
definitely
a
bit
lighter
in
terms
of
both
appearance
and
taste
and
more
hefelike
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
big
part
of
why
i
like
it
but
rather
than
argue
that
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
isnt
following
style
guidelines
i
would
rather
lie
back
sip
this
slowly
and
contemplate
how
said
brewery
can
make
such
consistently
incredible
beer
i
guess
practice
does
make
perfect
this
stuff
is
absolutely
worth
a
try
no
fan
of
german
beer
wheat
beer
or
beer
in
general
should
deny
themselves
the
hedonistic
pleasure
that
is
vitus
too
spicy
too
much
yeast
and
alcohol
riding
atop
a
decent
body
wheres
the
dunkel
in
this
cloudy
and
blonde
im
not
an
expert
but
the
definition
of
a
weizenbock
provided
by
this
web
site
is
fitting
so
maybe
the
beer
is
exactly
as
it
should
be
and
thats
something
i
cant
stand
drinking
like
a
lambic
at
first
i
could
appreciate
that
this
beer
had
very
unique
defined
flavors
but
they
just
dont
work
for
me
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
buy
some
tonight
a
fantastic
beer
aroma
and
taste
blew
me
away
make
sure
to
try
it
if
you
find
it
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
much
like
their
hefeweizen
with
a
massive
white
head
with
tightly
packed
creamy
bubbles
there
is
a
slight
rosy
pink
tint
to
the
beer
similar
to
how
the
hefeweizen
looked
which
may
come
from
the
heavy
haze
which
keeps
the
other
side
of
the
glass
obscured
from
view
lacing
is
fat
and
fluffy
again
reminding
me
of
the
hefeweizen
honestly
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
say
i
was
looking
their
hefeweizen
right
now
as
it
and
this
weizenbok
look
nearly
identical
on
the
nose
this
beer
is
heavy
spicy
banana
with
more
clove
than
in
the
hefeweizen
slight
hints
of
bubblegum
and
some
nice
light
cream
and
mint
notes
the
smell
is
quite
sticky
and
heavy
on
the
nostrils
in
contrast
with
all
other
weihenstephaner
beers
ive
sampled
the
beer
tastes
wonderfully
of
banana
bread
cloves
and
slight
bubble
gum
the
banana
flavors
are
more
over
ripe
than
in
other
wheat
beers
ive
sampled
the
beer
begins
with
light
spicy
clove
and
faint
banana
before
opening
into
bready
banana
flavors
with
slight
bubblegummint
hints
and
a
creamy
banana
smoothie
note
the
aftertaste
is
light
with
banana
on
the
mouth
this
beer
feels
chewy
and
creamy
of
a
medium
to
thick
viscosity
with
creamy
carbonation
on
the
tongue
that
really
starts
to
remind
me
of
a
banana
smoothie
the
mouth
is
left
clean
save
for
a
slight
creamy
ichor
of
sweet
saliva
overall
this
is
another
terrific
wheat
beer
from
weihenstephaner
similar
to
their
hefeweizen
but
a
bit
thicker
and
heavier
in
the
stomach
a
classic
for
sure
drink
this
beer
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
deeper
than
the
hubble
deep
field
the
wheat
is
so
thick
with
an
incredible
depth
of
flavor
this
is
the
beer
the
beer
if
i
had
to
have
one
more
beer
in
my
life
it
would
be
this
one
o
an
outstanding
beer
i
havent
read
enough
about
this
style
and
if
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
weizenbock
i
would
guess
it
was
a
hefe
either
way
its
remarkable
and
well
worth
the
positive
press
i
have
seen
for
it
highly
recommended
500ml
bottle
from
lifesource
in
salem
3
79
slightly
hazy
deep
gold
coloured
beer
with
a
bubbly
half
inch
thick
white
head
very
nice
strong
honeytoffee
scent
to
this
then
some
phenols
and
laid
back
spiciness
nice
really
taste
is
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
maybe
has
a
bit
more
fruit
in
it
again
nice
nice
smooth
easy
mouthfeel
goes
down
dangerously
easy
overall
a
good
beer
o
im
assuming
that
weihenstephans
vitus
is
a
weizenbock
blending
a
pale
bock
or
maibock
given
its
color
and
character
its
really
a
home
run
and
is
another
fabulous
wheat
beer
from
this
brewer
if
you
enjoy
their
hefeweissbier
than
youll
need
to
pick
this
up
as
well
it
reminds
me
of
that
very
hefe
jacked
up
on
richness
and
more
of
the
ingredients
i
enjoy
so
much
im
not
sure
on
the
availability
but
i
was
told
that
its
around
in
plenty
every
year
when
the
colder
months
start
rolling
in
just
german
at
its
best
and
simply
delicious
vitus
lives
up
to
the
label
thats
equipped
around
its
neck
bottle
from
bottles
and
bins
in
monterey
calif
the
german
beers
in
bottles
seem
to
travel
better
than
the
belgians
in
my
opinion
or
maybe
stores
feel
the
need
to
refrigerate
the
germans
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
enjoy
loads
of
flavor
great
balance
excellent
drinkability
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
o
a
light
highly
drinkable
high
abv
beer
good
but
not
something
ill
seek
out
unless
i
have
the
need
to
get
drunk
on
a
lawn
chair
some
summer
day
3

what
weihenstephaner
does
is
pretty
simple
but
they
execute
it
extremely
well
and
thats
what
makes
them
so
great
add
this
beer
to
their
list
of
great
brews
not
only
are
they
delicious
but
they
are
reasonably
priced
as
well
oa
delicious
weizenbock
great
flavors
and
refreshing
style
wise
it
scores
a
4
personally
3
75
due
to
its
well
hidden
strength
very
balanced
and
easy
drinking
7
7
abv
is
well
hidden
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
wheat
beers
or
even
if
youre
not
should
be
searched
out
and
consumed
immediately
o
this
is
what
i
remembered
from
earlier
in
the
year
its
a
superior
beer
and
my
first
from
weihenstephan
left
a
amazing
first
impression
id
like
to
think
of
it
as
more
of
a
summerwarmer
weather
beer
but
even
now
its
outstanding
and
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
surprisingly
good
beer
like
really
good
o
vitus
was
voted
best
beer
at
the
world
beer
awards
for
2011
now
i
taste
why
a
great
session
beer
very
affordable
at
under
4
for
a
750
ml
recommended
overall
a
real
enjoyable
beer
that
drinks
like
a
saison
poured
from
16oz
bottle
into
glass
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
thick
creamy
head
looks
fantastic
thick
foamy
lacing
and
good
carbonation
fantastic
banana
clove
hefe
aromas
some
nice
wheat
malt
and
some
slight
slight
mild
hop
really
amazing
aromas
flavor
is
crisp
bright
banana
wheat
with
a
slight
chewy
almost
chocolatey
flavor
really
great
flavors
its
just
an
all
around
fantastic
brew
well
worth
the
price
and
just
great
flavors
and
drinkability
for
under
4
a
bottle
you
should
all
ready
be
drinking
one
overall
delicious
very
drinkable
i
really
want
this
one
again
super
tasty
german
beer
a
poetic
marriage
of
flavors
with
a
peppery
hint
on
the
finish
awesome
this
is
what
i
expect
out
of
this
brewery
every
time
overall
a
great
showing
from
weihenstephaner
but
not
mind
blowing
they
certainly
make
the
best
wheat
beers
but
i
actually
think
their
regular
wheat
beer
or
the
dunkle
are
comparable
to
this
one
the
flavors
are
a
little
light
for
the
higher
abv
but
its
still
worth
checking
out
o
the
true
alcohol
strength
of
this
beer
is
so
amazingly
hidden
i
would
have
guessed
that
it
was
no
more
than
5
and
its
nearly
8
drinks
extremely
easily
and
more
like
a
regular
hefe
than
a
bock
absolutely
worth
trying
especially
at
the
price
battle
weizenbock
this
evening
goes
to
weihenstaphener
ayinger
is
really
really
good
but
weihen
knocks
it
out
of
most
parks
including
yosemite
o
simply
put
this
is
the
best
beer
for
the
style
i
have
ever
had
and
might
just
be
the
greatest
beer
i
have
ever
had
period
just
so
very
good
my
very
first
all
5s
review
as
i
dont
see
how
this
brew
could
possibly
be
improved
i
encourge
beer
lovers
everywhere
to
give
this
a
try
if
havent
already
like
most
other
beers
in
the
weihenstephaner
lineup
vitus
is
a
solid
offering
at
a
mere
3
49
a
bottle
this
is
one
of
the
best
deals
going
my
only
complaint
is
is
that
this
beer
failed
to
exhibit
any
of
the
bock
characteristics
that
are
typically
found
in
a
well
executed
weizenbock
served
from
growler
into
a
sampler
shaker
poured
a
hazy
golden
bright
yellow
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sugar
banana
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
bread
fruit
and
spice
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
all
of
the
right
notes
that
one
would
expect
were
going
on
in
this
one
this
fact
made
it
quite
enjoyable
and
definitely
a
good
start
for
anyone
looking
to
try
something
new
all
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
were
onpoint
on
this
one
this
made
it
quite
easy
to
drink
and
was
enjoyable
for
all
in
attendance
at
the
tasting
where
i
sampled
it
definitely
worth
your
time
if
you
have
not
had
it
or
if
you
want
to
try
a
solid
brew
in
the
style
o
this
brewery
knows
what
they
are
doing
the
dunkel
hefe
the
traditional
hefe
korbinian
and
now
this
excellence
overall
it
is
a
very
goodtasting
complex
wheat
beer
with
much
nuance
had
this
many
times
in
the
past
one
of
my
preferred
brews
first
time
to
review
it
like
the
rest
of
the
brewerys
offerings
very
nice
drinkability
although
it
tries
to
be
a
little
different
from
the
regular
commercial
offerings
wish
i
were
a
little
more
coherent
to
give
this
a
more
deserving
review
o
a
solid
yet
plain
beer
not
as
vibrant
or
excellent
as
their
hefe
still
very
delicious
with
a
fantastic
banana
and
peach
presence
the
alcohol
is
far
too
dominating
and
the
flavor
profile
extremely
muted
not
a
bad
deal
for
2
89
for
a
500ml
bottle
but
probably
wont
be
going
back
for
this
one
overall
another
solid
offering
by
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
carbonation
is
some
great
and
i
love
the
drinkability
factor
of
this
german
style
beer
another
tasty
beer
overall
wow
get
it
when
available
beautiful
beer
bright
cloudy
golden
topped
by
foamy
rocky
white
head
aroma
is
sharp
lemons
booze
apple
skins
tastes
of
banana
vanilla
clove
lemon
cookie
and
slight
booze
spritzy
medium
bodied
brew
but
refreshing
and
smooth
gorgeous
and
tasty
can
i
ask
for
anything
else
pretty
much
a
textbook
example
of
a
weizenbock
o
lighter
than
most
other
weizenbocks
that
ive
had
i
like
the
absence
of
the
dark
fruit
cherry
element
light
and
refreshing
like
a
hefeweizen
only
much
stronger
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
cloves
and
bananas
with
a
little
bit
of
toffee
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
very
similar
i
get
a
lot
of
strong
banana
and
clove
notes
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
pepper
there
is
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
weizenbock
one
of
the
best
i
have
tried
weihenstephaner
vitus
the
bottle
says
na
all
in
all
this
is
a
truly
excellent
beer
not
only
is
it
complex
its
light
and
drinkablea
great
choice
for
warm
weather
and
the
kind
of
beer
even
the
most
casual
beer
drinker
can
appreciate
and
did
i
mention
its
7
7
kick
back
and
grab
one
because
my
only
real
criticism
is
that
i
havent
got
more
left
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
mountainous
rocky
white
head
honestly
the
gentlest
pour
is
all
you
need
to
make
a
fluffy
head
that
most
beers
couldnt
produce
when
poured
with
the
utmost
vigor
a
solid
bouquet
of
banana
and
cloves
serves
as
a
worthy
harbinger
of
whats
to
come
banana
bread
clove
and
wheat
meld
together
to
great
effect
and
the
mouthfeel
is
exquisite
the
bountiful
carbonation
accentuates
the
spiciness
nicely
and
serves
to
temper
a
fruitiness
that
could
become
cloying
if
left
unchecked
one
really
has
to
search
for
a
fault
but
if
im
being
picky
there
is
a
very
slight
metallic
taste
in
the
finish
but
its
negligible
this
weizenbock
is
more
weizen
than
bock
and
that
serves
me
just
fine
its
velvety
delicious
and
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
one
the
finest
brews
from
an
outstanding
brewery
it
shouldnt
be
this
drinkable
for
nearly
8

o
i
think
ive
finally
covered
all
of
weihenstephans
offerings
all
of
them
are
spot

the

perhaps
a
hint
of
vanilla
taste
is
much
like
the
weih

with
more
power

very
complex
flavors
and
a
great
combination
of

phenos

like
a

feels
is
somewhat
heavy
carbonation
and
dry
very
smooth
and
coating
overall
another
great
offering
and
much
like
the
hefe
new
to
this
style
so
dont
have
a
ton
to
compare
it
too
i
will
say
if
you
like
the
hefe
you
will
like
this
complex
and
refreshing
with
a
great
blend
of
malts
and

i
love
this
beer
nonetheless
is
beer
is
solid
and
defenately
worth
the
purchase
overall
one
of
the
best
white
beers
ive
had
it
tastes
like
a
better
version
more
strongly
defined
as
the
regular
hefeweiss
of
weihenstephaner
its
packed
with
flavors
with
only
the
bit
of
metal
like
bitterness
as
a
slight
downside
overall
as
usual
with
this
brewery
fantastic
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
easy
to
enjoy
one
of
the
best
weizenbocks
out
there
try
this
one
world
class
beer
of
course
this
was
surprisingly
strong
but
nothing
that
detracted
from
the
experience
of
this
beer
i
do
prefer
my
weizenbocks
on
the
darker
and
more
fruity
side
but
like
anything
else
from
weihenstephan
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
the
particular
style
and
a
musttry
for
anyone
who
likes
his
or
her
beer
unfiltered
im
fully
impressed
by
this
one
it
was
delicious
and
a
joy
to
drink
be
sure
to
pick
this
up
if
you
see
it
overall
ive
had
a
few
since
my
first
one
and
im
not
too
crazy
about
it
any
more
its
very
sound
but
not
brimming
with
flavour
i
think
this
brewery
is
a
bit
overrated
on
ba
o
weihenstephaner
continues
to
impress
overall
a
solid
beer
though
a
bit
rich
for
me
to
thoroughly
enjoy
for
much
more
than
a
beer
not
one
id
session
good
dessert
beer
though
id
more
likely
opt
for
their
dunkel
in
its
stead
mediumbodied
with
abundant
carbonation
it
feels
slightly
prickly
in
the
mouth
hefeweizen
is
one
of
my
favourite
styles
of
beer
possibly
even
my
absolute
this
delivers
much
of
what
i
love
about
a
good
weissbier
in
an
amplified
fashion
prost
o
an
amazing
weizenbock
full
of
fruity
and
rich
flavors
highly
recommended
if
youre
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
o
a
nice
brew
that
maintains
a
good
flavor
without
falling
victim
to
its
abv
and
while
i
really
like
the
complexity
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
man
the
feel
is
very
rough
almost
tough
to
drink
this
is
good
but
its
far
from
a
goto
for
me
overall
i
want
to
give
it
a
4
25
but
that
is
not
an
option
so
i
am
in
the
4
5
range
as
this
is
so
easy
drinking
flavors
are
very
pronounced
great
balancea
must
have
cheers
having
finished
this
beer
while
writing
this
review
i
am
excitingly
buzzed
i
feel
like
my
body
reacts
to
the
alcohol
in
every
beer
differently
and
this
one
brings
me
up
perhaps
it
is
the
exaggerated
fruitiness
that
tricks
my
metabolism
into
thinking
i
am
eating
a
banana
but
either
way
it
is
great
but
beyond
that
speak
strictly
about
the
brew
itself
i
love
the
way
i
am
simultaneously
blownaway
by
the
big
flavors
and
comfortably
enticed
by
its
balance
o
good
beer
but
the
sweetness
really
detracts
for
me
as
i
get
further
into
the
glass
by
the
end
my
lips
were
sticky
and
i
wouldnt
have
wanted
another
o
although
this
is
pretty
much
weihenstephaners
hefeweissbier
with
less
phenols
and
more
fruit
its
really
enjoyable
ive
heard
that
a
really
fresh
bottle
is
even
better
so
ill
be
on
the
lookout
this
time
though
it
was
delicious

this

absolutely
fantastic
weizenbock

insane
flavor

and
complexity
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
for
the
level
of

this
one
is
definitely
better
when
it
is
fresher
previous

nice

of
scents
and
flavors
and
the
mouthfeel
is
really
unique
overall
an
excellent
full
flavored
weizenbock
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
german
style
weizenbock
cheers
at
the
risk
of
sounding
completely
ignorant
i
have
to
profess
my
surprise
that
this
is
considered
such
a
highlyrated
weizenbock
its
more
like
a
hefeweiss
dont
misunderstand
me
it
tastes
great
but
if
i
must
consider
it
a
weizenbock
then
i
am
confident
in
saying
that
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
aventinus
tap
6
in
my
opintion
the
lack
of
a
substantial
malt
character
hurts
this
beer
o
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
explore
way
more
of
them
it
is
absolutely
fantastic
it
smells
tastes
and
feels
terrific
with
absolutely
no
sign
of
the
7
7
abv
i
can
definitely
see
why
this
was
named
the
best
beer
in
the
world
at
the
2011
world
beer
awards
close
to
perfection
overall
well
balanced
beer
that
should
not
be
taken
for
granted
doesnt
cost
much
and
gives
you
a
lot
drink
with
pride
salud
od
a
lovely
beer
complexities
combined
with
subleties
nice
stuff
so
many
flavours
o
quite
a
good
beer
overall
flavorful
drinkable
and
refreshing
overall
a
bit
lacking
in
the
darker
flavors
that
are
typical
of
this
style
a
good
overall
beer
lots
of
flavor
the
lighter
flavors
allow
the
alcohol
to
shine
through
a
bit
more
than
normal
the
carbonation
sting
lightens
up
and
the
flavors
blend
more
smoothly
once
the
brew
warms
up
a
bit
this
is
a
very
unique
tasting
beer
that
hides
the
7
7
abv
very
well
well
worth
a
try
overall
this
was
excellent
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
weizenbock
style
but
this
one
has
got
me
intrigued
top
notch
stuff
overall
a
reasonably
price
beer
that
looks
smells
feels
and
tastes
amazing
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
could
a
beer
lover
ask
for
more
id
say
no
vitus
is
an
all
time
favorite
and
a
real
showstopper
for
me
pick
this
beer
up
you
will
not
be
dissappointed
poured
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
massive
soapy
head
that
just
wouldnt
quit
little
lacing
smelled
much
like
its
cousin
brews
banana
bread
and
citrus
and
spice
and
all
that
taste
was
crisp
with
obvious
alcohol
essence
and
warmth
throughout
felt
comfortably
slick
in
the
mouth
overall
delicious
beer
will
certainly
continue
to
shuffle
between
this
and
other
weihenstephaner
brews
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
vitus
is
still
a
prime
weizenbock
a
paler
breadier
example
of
the
style
definitely
showcasing
the

this
is
a
gem
of
a
wiessbier
complex
and
full
of
depth
impossibly
delicious
poured
into
a
goblet
from
the
bottle
the
weizenbock
registered
a
golden
hue
its
aroma
was
sweet
bearing
notes
of
banana
and
wheat
a
very
appealing
scent
was
recorded
the
initial
taste
was
the
awesome
belgian
yeast
tang
that
reminds
many
of
bananas
this
flavor
alone
makes
this
a
great
beer
but
the
taste
goes
further
also
accompanying
the
yeast
was
a
mild
peppery
notes
that
only
served
to
give
the
beer
a
delightfully
more
complex
layer
a
hint
of
honey
was
even
detectable
the
sweet
notes
continued
to
the
finish
at
which
point
the
peppery
notes
became
slightly
more
obvious
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
being
easy
on
the
carbonation
while
i
like
the
hefeweiss
better
this
is
still
an
excellent
beer
in
the
price
range
of
almost
any
drinker
overall
very
solid
choice
but
be
wary
a
beer
at
7
7
thats
this
drinkable
can
be
dangerous
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
have
never
gotten
so
much
banana
flavor
from
a
beer
before
in
my
life
and
this
beer
is
just
very
refreshing
overall
will
drink
again
this
is
an
absolutely
awesome
beer
for
the
springsummer
months
and
could
be
a
substitute
for
leffe
or
duveltypes
in
my
opinion
good
stuff
overall
a
very
refreshing
weizen
beer
at
bock
strength
perfect
for
the
spring
and
summer
warmer
temps
wish
me
luck

recently
won
some

contest
while
it
falls
way
short
of
that
title
its
a
solid
beer
that
id
be
willing
to
try
again
o
overall
i
had
been
hearing
some
buzz
about
this
beer
for
a
while
and
when
i
saw
it
for
just
over
3
a
pop
at
my
local
grocer
how
could
i
resist
as
far
as
bang
for
your
buck
this
one
takes
the
cake
wonderfully
tasty
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
wheats
but
i
really
dig
this
beer
very
refreshing
and
perfectly
balanced
7

not
evident
smooth
and
delicious
classic
germanbrew
goodness
highly
recommended
overall
i
think
this
seems
a
little
more
like
a
strong
hefeweizen
than
a
true
weizenbock
on
the
website
they
describe
this
as
a
single
bock
weizen
it
really
doesnt
do
what
i
think
a
weizenbock
should
which
is
marry
a
doppelbock
and
a
dunkelweizen
nonetheless
a
great
flavor
that
i
really
enjoy
pours
hazy
golden
with
an
abundant
white
head
there
is
excellent
head
retention
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
also
some
banana
esters
which
are
both
very
inviting
theres
some
malt
breadiness
and
fruity
sweetness
in
the
flavor
there
are
flavors
of
banana
and
citrus
this
is
very
tasty
the
alcohol
kick
is
not
strong
in
the
taste
the
flavors
do
a
great
job
of
covering
it
up
the
body
is
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
the
body
is
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
delicious
d
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
i
still
prefer
the
standard
hefeweizen
over
this
beer
but
definitely
one
to
try
overall
another
great
beer
ive
been
pleased
with
from
weihenstephaner
this
was
a
real
quality
weizenbock
well
balanced
with
real
good
depth
in
both
the
aromas
and
flavors
the
feel
was
extremely
good
finds
like
this
are
why
i
enjoy
the
exploration
of
beer
worth
a
try
enjoy
o
top
notch
not
really
sure
it
gets
much
better
than
this
in
this
style
an
awesome
blend
of
smell
taste
and
feel
o
i
really
dont
think
this
brewer
can
do
anything
wrong
everything
ive
enjoyed
from
them
has
been
nothing
short
of
spectacular
this
is
no
exception
overall
a
decent
beer
which
a
lot
of
people
will
like
but
i
just
found
it
crazy
sweet
wow
wouldya
look
at
the
name
of
this
brewery
what
a
mouthful
but
would
the
vitus
be
a
mouthful
i
approved
of
well
to
find
out
i
poured
this
weizenbock
out
of
a
bottle
into
my
glass
where
it
quickly
formed
a
billowing
head
of
slightly
yellowtinted
foam
the
liquid
itself
was
a
cloudy
golden
wheat
color
with
lots
of
rising
carbonation
the
retention
of
the
head
proved
to
be
quite
good
and
it
left
sliding
bands
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
and
some
doughy
malt
fruity
esters
cloves
coriander
honey
and
a
little
pepper
the
flavors
were
pleasantly
complex
yet
inviting
and
very
agreeable
i
tasted
the
sweet
malt
and
wheat
first
with
notes
of
shortbread
cookie
dough
sorta
sweet
buttery
and
vanillaish
followed
by
the
aforementioned
spices
the
honey
and
fruity
esters
appeared
in
the
middle
along
with
some
honeysuckle
and
floral
hops
the
pepper
note
combined
with
the
hops
towards
the
end
giving
it
a
spicy
spirited
finish
i
was
also
totally
amazed
at
how
easy
it
was
to
drink
this
beer
7

are
you
sure
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
on
the
feisty
side
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
think
its
a
bargain
for
the
quality
it
delivers
not
to
mention
the
efficacy
of
its
impact
t
archetypal
weizenbock
that
showcases
complex
flavours
without
sacrificing
much
of
the
eminently
refreshing
easydrinking
character
of
a
plain
weizen
worth
seeking
out
o
like
a
blend
between
a
tripel
and
a
normal
weihenstephaner
interesting
and
rewarding
i
really
really
like
it
highly
recommended
will
drink
again
superlative
example
of
the
style
clearly
excellent
and
particularly
refreshing
example
of
style
but
not
a
favorite
style
for
me
remarkably
well
hidden
alcohol
drinks
like
3
abv
it
is
remarkable
how
light
this
brew
feels
despite
having
such
bold
flavors
and
higher
abv
if
it
werent
for
the
strength
of
this
brew
this
would
be
one
i
would
enjoy
again
and
again
on
the
patio
still
a
terrific
brew
and
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
o
a
great
occasional
indulgence
o
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
the
7
7
abv
is
sneaky
considering
how
light
and
refreshing
it
is
what
a
classic
i
have
returned
to

although
not
my
very
favorite
truly
it
was
a
little

busy
with

and

to
be
as
refreshing
as
id
expect
from
the
class

a
good

again
world
class
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
weizenbock
but
it
was
much
more
different
then
all
the
other
ones
i
have
had
i
havent
tried
much
of
the
style
but
all
the
ones
i
have
had
prior
to
this
one
were
much
darker
and
had
some
roast
to
it
to
go
with
those
banana
and
spicy
yeast
flavors
so
i
am
little
confused
by
this
beer
but
this
brewery
is
one
of
the
oldest
so
it
could
be
that
this
is
what
a
true
weizenbock
is
like
and
the
all
the
american
ones
i
had
have
took
the
non
traditional
road
i
am
going
to
have
to
try
more
german
weizenbocks
to
figure
this
puzzle
out
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
went
down
very
smooth
and
held
my
attention
i
will
for
sure
be
drinking
this
in
the
summer
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
how
complex
the
flavors
were
and
how
good
it
looked
there
was
nothing
that
i
didnt
like
about
this
beer
it
was
what
it
was
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
especially
in
the
summer
and
i
recommend
this
to
any
wheat
beer
lover
i
liked
this
beer
even
though
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expected
weihenstephaner
comes
through
with
a
solid
beer
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
darker
ones
instead
either
way
it
was
solid
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
the
best
weizenbock
i
can
possibly
imagine
overall
a
very
very
good
beer
overall
score
reflects
that
i
was
somewhere
in
between
4
and
4
5
taste
wise
good
stuff
o
this
is
a
classic
weizenbock
no
doubt
about
it
a
great
weizenbock
that
has
stood
the
test
of
time
i
will
absolutely
revisit
this
at
another
time
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
it
o
really
great
taste
drinks
incredibly
easily
smooth
just
nice
all
around
o
a
pretty
simple
beer
but
a
great
balance
and
drinkability
to
it
refreshing
fruity
and
wheaty
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
more
like
aventinus
in
regards
to
a
weizenbock
pretty
much
a
delicious
hefe
on
roids
overall
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
with
a
great
fruity
and
spicy
flavour
you
can
taste
the
quality
and
the
beer
is
a
steal
at
3

picking
up

something
i
will
buy
much
more
of
d
very
good
stuff
like
tasting
the
first
day
of
spring
refreshing
and
well
balanced
new
to
this
style
but
enjoyed
this
very
much
and
will
be
seeking
out
other
weizenbocks
o
another
classic
from
weihenstephaner
fantastic
beer
would
certainly
drink
this
one
again
atmosphere
is
really
good
great
head
and
simple
but
full
nose
flavor
is
simple
but
very
well
executed
very
pure
and
true
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
very
hazy

with
a
big
pillowy

and
lacing
the
aroma
is

and
estery
with

along
with

with
lots

of
clove
and
pepper
sweet
malt
profile
throughout
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
medium
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
a
great
beer
which
drinks
very
well
and
struck
me
much
like
a
suped
up
hefe
and
is
a
bit
dangerous
in
that
regard
o
these
guys
have
anything
weizen
nailed
no
need
to
question
you
know
youll
be
satisfied
with
anything
they
produce
have
at
er
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
one
this
is
a
very
easygoing
hefe
and
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
nice
wheat
overall
pretty
nice
and
pleasant
and
refreshing
kind
of
what
you
expect
from
weihenstephan
oa
very
good
i
like
this
german
style
that
sticks
to
the
original
brewing
law
tastes
like
high
class
well
played
body
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
with
modest
carbonation
allowing
for
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
just
a
bit
of
foaming
up
on
the
palate
finish
is
dry
slightly
sticky
from
sweetness
instead
of
being
obviously
smelt
or
tasted
alcohol
burn
is
felt
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
throat
after
each
sip
o
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
and
impressively
delicate
especially
considering
the
relatively
high
abv
i
am
not
usually
one
for
wheat
beers
but
to
me
this
is
a
beautiful
example
of
everything
i
like
about
them
while
leaving
out
everything
i
dont
if
i
were
to
pick
a
beer
for
a
spring
picnic
this
is
my
handsdown
winner
for
me
the
bavarian
bar
has
been
set
o
pretty
frickin
good
usually
the
banannas
and
clove
overpower
but
not
in
this
one
blended
very
well
and
will
recommend
to
everyone
ill
be
honest
after
seeing
coloradobob
mention
this
a
bunch
in
the
forums
i
decided
i
had
to
try
it
and
im
not
disappointed
another
great
beer
from
this
brewery
vitus
pours
a
rich
hazy
straw
color
head
retention
is
minimal
the
only
thing
preventing
this
brew
from
getting
a
perfect
score
i
would
prefer
a
chunkier
foam
it
tastes
like
a
beefed
up
version
of
their
hefeweizen
cloves
banana
bread
with
a
slightly
alcoholic
tinge
its
awesome
seeing
this
on
a
shelf
so
far
away
prost
pours
a
murky
yelloworange
with
an
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lace
on
this
one
smell
is
of
wheat
spices
bubblegum
and
banana
taste
is
much
the
same
with
strong
flavors
and
the
banana
coming
through
especially
on
the
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
extremely
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
actually
like
this
more
than
the
weihenstephaner
hefe
which
i
found
underwhelming
its
surprisingly
drinkable
for
how
maltheavy
it
is
and
it
hides
the
abv
very
well
id
certainly
recommend
this
as
an
outstanding
weizenbock
a
weird
confluence
of
euro
styles
in
the
end
this
is
really
a
bigass
witbier
or
hefeweizen
take
your
pick
even
as
the
booze
laughs
off
its
obvious
obfuscation
a
wee
bit
too
light
for
the
style
but
who
am
i
to
argue
with
centuries
to
the
contrary
i
think
i
need
to
research
the
style
because
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
this
reminds
me
of
a
double
hefe
if
that
makes
sense
drink
it
and
youll
understand
what
i
mean
overall
a
weizenbock
im
not
convinced
i
consider
schneider
weisse
aventinus
a
true
weizenbock
which
is
why
it
remains
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
this
one
reminded
me
more
of
a
pumpedup
hefeweizen
than
a
weizenbock
either
way
it
was
pretty
darn
tasty
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
weihenstephaner
knows
how
to
make
some
really
great
beers
well
done
definitely
my
favourite
beer
this
winter
and
quite
possibly
my
favourite
weihenstephaner
beer
o
wheat
beer
with
a
nice
alcoholic
bite
and
amped
up
fruitiness
tasty
and
satisfying
can
weihenstephaner
make
a
beer
that
i
dont
adore
if
i
can
keep
character
and
store
a
couple
in
my
cellar
this
beer
most
certainly
will
evolve
into
something
out
of
this
world
another
great
offering
by
weihenstephaner
ill
definitely
be
picking
this
up
again
oanother
winner
from
weihenstephaner
do
they
make
a
bad
beer
i
dare
say
that
i
may
enjoy
it
more
than
their
hefe
which
is
a
feat
i
can
only
imagine
how
refreshing
it
would
be
on
a
hot
summer
day
hopefully
in
a
few
months
i
will
be
able
to
find
out
never
had
a
beer
of
this
style
with
so
much
restrained
balance
as
this
one
it
acts
like
it
wants
to
go
over
the
top
and
push
further
but
stays
classy
in
its
refined
control
did
i
mention
its
drinkability
yeah
its
real
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
weizenbock
especially
for
the
price
the
alcohol
content
is
moderately
high
for
just
how
delightfully
drinkable
this
beer
is
i
think
itd
be
excellent
in
any
season
o
very
very
good
stuff
spicy
and
sweet
and
complex
and
would
pair
well
with
alot
of
foods
i
would
imagine
drinkability
overall
this
beer
is
so
incredible
when
it
comes
to
drink
ability
i
cant
tell
you
its
through
the
roof
never
once
do
i
feel
im
drinking
a
7
7
percent
beer
overall
this
is
with
out
a
doubt
the
best
wheat
beer
i
have
had
to
date
it
has
the
wheat
flavors
but
the
bigger
body
and
dryness
i
look
for
and
enjoy
in
a
beer
this
beer
is
the
proof
for
the
non
hard
core
wheat
fan
of
how
delicious
these
beers
can
be
i
enjoy
that
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
caramel
that
some
of
this
style
have
one
i
could
drink
all
night
at
any
time
of
the
year
just
great
stuff
cant
say
enough
from
a
great
brewery
o
easy
drinker
good
example
of
the
style
well
worth
a
try
this
beer
is
truly
outstanding
it
is
clean
and
simple
and
leaves
no
room
for
error
the
fact
that
its
perfect
is
what
makes
it
so
exceptional
temp
46f
notes
dam
this
is
tasty
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
cheers
overall
this
is
a
truly
fantastic
example
of
german
simplicity
and
subtle
flavors
triumphing
over
extreme
hops
or
malt
its
truly
one
to
behold
i
find
that
this
one
really
benefits
from
serving
in
a
frosty
mass
the
ceramic
really
syncs
with
the
flavors
of
the
wheat
and
makes
a
fantastic
symphony
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
weihenstephaners
vitus
its
an
extremely
well
done
weizenbock
and
another
great
beer
from
a
fantastic
brewery
world
class
and
highly
recommended
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
shot
a
refreshing
delicious
beer
i
expected
it
would
be
darker
and
heavier
from
the
style
description
but
it
is
not
in
the
end
its
apparent
that
no
one
does
german
beer
like
weihenstephaner
o
this
is
a
firstrate
weizenbock
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavors
from
start
to
finish
and
still
wellbalanced
pours
a
lovely
orangehued
wheat
gold
very
good
head
and
carbonation
it
has
the
wheat
beer
aroma
youd
expect
but
the
alcohol
intensifies
it
the
higher
abv
also
contributes
to
the
crisp
spiciness
vitus
is
delicious
ive
had
weihenstephaner
hefe
a
few
times
already
and
have
yet
to
review
it
though
it
is
a
musttry
classic
you
can
tell
vitus
is
made
by
the
same
craftsmen
but
the
flavor
explosion
is
just
a
step
above
especially
good
for
special
occasions
weihenstephaner
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
the
lager
and
wheat
exceptionally
good
and
sessionable
and
the
vitus
and
korbinian
outstanding
for
showing
how
simple
ingredients
can
turn
into
a
thing
of
pure
magic
this
is
the
type
of
beer
you
would
ask
noch
eins
bitte
perfect
anytime
of
year
session
or
with
food
d
still
retains
the
classic
weissbier
characteristic
but
unfortunately
the
malty
bock
quality
has
subdued
to
be
replaced
by
a
slight
buttery
quality
in
the
finish
experiment
complete
not
one
to
cellar
but
probably
knew
that
anyway
pours
a
cloudy

for

very

overall
good

and
good
qualities
omg
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
claimed
with
the
weizen
bock
old
school
beer
love
it
a
little
sweet
on
the
after
taste
low
carbonation
but
mouth
feel
is
good
this
one
is
sweet
and
i
like
the
hoppyspiceydry
types
generally
but
this
one
is
so
nice
with
a
little
kick
not
so
sweet
like
many
of
the
belgian
beers
a
little
cloudy
on
the
appearace
i
know
its
not
a
krystall
but
not
a
great
look
drink
it
as
it
should
not
disappoint
before
today
id
thought
that
aventinus
was
the
pinnacle
of
weizenbocks
i
was
wrong
500
ml
bottle
served
in
a
weizen
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
straw
gold
color
with
a
couple
inch
frothy
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
theres
a
small
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
brew
smells
like
wheat
lemon
peel
banana
and
cloves
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
also
the
addition
of
some
bubblegum
and
orange
flavors
its
a
little
sweeter
tasting
than
i
was
expecting
but
thats
a
good
thing
in
this
case
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
has
good
carbonation
overall
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
brew
a
great
deal
for
just
2
99
a
bottle
definitely
recommended
overall
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
love
how
it
drinks
like
a
strong
hefe
lots
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
an
extremely
enjoyable
beer
gotta
try
one
of
the
classic
german
weuizenbocks
right
it
pours
a
cloudy
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
banana
peel
light
lemon
zest
light
ginger
honey
and
a
small
amount
of
clove
the
taste
focuses
on
the
wheat
but
allows
some
lemon
zest
honey
clove
banana
and
orange
rind
in
there
as
well
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
grainy
feel
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
wbock
something
i
could
easily
see
drinking
plenty
of
if
put
in
the
proper
situation
o
one
of
the
greatest
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
amazing
overal
a
rather
good
beer
not
my
favourite
style
though
id
rather
have
the
hefeweizen
or
the
korbinian
not
some
hybrid
owonderful
weizenbock
t
on
the
taste
the
banana
is
magnificent
the
critics
and
wheat
is
very
well
balanced
the
end
shows
sweetbitterness
and
alcohol
presence
o
another
beautifully
crafted
and
full
flavoured
gem
from
weihenstephan
a
must
try
for
any
beer
lover
really
solid
and
delicious
highly
recommended
o
overall
a
good
flavor
a
bit
more
sweet
and
toasty
then
im
used
to
per
style
smooth
yeasty
nature
not
overpowering
but
easily
manageable
alcohol
is
easily
hidden
by
its
sweetness
cleanly
brewed
as
with
all
their
drinks
with
a
smooth
refinement
d
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
one
is
a
bit
more
rare
than
some
other
weihenstephan
brews
but
one
thats
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
have
access
o
this
is
a
nice
wheat
beer
it
has
a
big
heavy
body
that
the
taste
and
appearance
dont
quite
match
up
with
it
is
the
lightestcolored
weizenbock
ive
seen
and
i
would
prefer
the
extra
malt
that
goes
along
with
the
darker
interpretations
o
this
is
it
ladies
and
gentleman
bayerische
weihenstephan
has
come
up
with
an
impeccable
formula
on
how
a
beer
should
be
made
this
beer
excels
in
pretty
much
every
category
and
makes
for
an
amazing
experience
even
better
this
beer
is
fairly
accessible
so
it
must
be
part
of
your
fridge
at
all
times
the
excellent
combination
of
flavorsaromas
make
up
for
an
incredible
experience
that
its
really
hard
to
describe
unless
you
try
this
beer
highly
recommended
and
definitely
worthy
of
a
world
class
nomenclature
at
least
in
my
opinion
o
3
5
overall
german
beers
tend
to
be
too
sweetmalty
for
my
tastes
but
as
far
as
weizenbocks
go
this
was
very
drinkable
a
wonderful
creation
after
picking
up
3
different
bottles
of
weinhenstephaner
recently
and
not
drinking
anything
by
them
for
a
long
time
my
love
for
german
styles
is
rekindled
why
oh
why
have
american
brewers
been
trying
to
belgianize
their
beers
they
should
be
germanizing
them
this
beer
is
a
case
in
point
heres
hoping
for
some
deutscher
barleywines
in
the
coming
year
overall
a
very
good
wheat
brew
but
a
little
thinnner
and
lighter
than
expected
from
a
weizenbock
but
this
is
still
a
stunner
and
i
plan
on
stocking
up
for
3
50
a
bottle
with
this
and
their
hefeweissbier
a
think
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
but
not
necessarily
a
great
weizenbock
theres
not
quite
enough
melanoidin
development
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
to
put
it
quite
in
the
category
but
its
still
damn
tasty
o
an
excellent
example
of
this
classic
german
style
dr
easy
drinking
high
abv
for
the
style
and
a
high
price
4
euro
for
a
half
pint
decent
quality
but
a
bit
dirty
perhaps
the
tap
needed
cleaning
o
a
solid
offering
a
bit
lighter
than
i
had
anticipated
but
the
yeastiness
seemed
to
salvage
its
taste
when
i
was
initially
concerned
upon
the
less
than
stellar
aroma
o
overall
quite
good
very
similar
to
the
hefe
but
breadier
and
more
intense
maybe
a
bit
too
citrusforward
but
a
wonderful
beer
overall

conclusion
this
is
an
awesome
beer
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
on
this
planet
this
beer
didnt
blow
my
mind
as
many
of
their
others
have
but
it
impressed
me
as
usual
this
is
like
their
normal
wheat
on
steroids
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
lacks
the
outstanding
luster
and
sparkle
of
flavor
that
the
normal
wheat
has
overall
this
is
really
good
for
the
style
i
like
the
smoothness
of
the
yeasty
flavors
what
a
tasty
wheat
beer
layers
of
the
typical
banana
but
seems
to
have
more
of
a
citrus
character
to
it
than
most
big
wheats
pours
with
a
pillowy
white
lasting
head
nice
cloudy
appearance
smells
of
lots
banana
with
some
citrus
hidden
in
the
back
end
citrus
clovey
finish
hides
the
alcohol
extremely
well
tasty
beer
o
this
is
a
straightforward
and
excellent
brew
from
weihenstephan
will
definitely
have
this
again
the
craftsmanship
and
expertise
in
the
style
is
obvious
this
wonderful
beer
has
been
excellent
for
hundreds
of
years
and
will
be
for
hundreds
more
take
a
break
from
ticking
mediocre
beers
to
rediscover
this
masterpiece
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
banana
a
small
dry
banana
in
the
the
taste
bananas
for
sure
and
a
hint
of
dry
alcohol
a
small
alcohol
like
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
banana
and
alcohol
like
aftertaste
light
in
color
and
a
bit
boozy
but
nice
overall
i
am
really
glad
this
beer
wasnt
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
nice
and
smooth
an
easy
drinker
m
the
mouthfeel
is
not
very
hard
it
is
balanced
and
well
done
a
medium
last
ending
not
bitter
not
sweet
but
with
some
alcohol
can
be
sensed
o
not
the
best
in
this
style
but
a
good
drink
o
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
no
hint
of
the
7
7
abv
which
could
be
sneaky
would
love
to
come
across
it
on
tap
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
i
could
drink
a
pitcher
of
this
o
my
favourite
brew
from
this
brewery
just
as
good
shaded
as
the
hopfen
weisse
in
this
style
for
what
this
is
i
find
it
pretty
exceptional
its
a
rigid
style
but
this
is
satisfying
yet
sophisticated
it
was
also
reasonably
inexpensive
weihenstephan
puts
another
one
in
the
back
of
the
net
food
match
paired
with
grilled
meats
like
a
giant
leg
of
pork
it
would
be
akin
to
paradise
sorry
vegetarian
brethren
sided
with
fried
potato
onion
and
bacon
another
german
classic
and
even
a
side
of
sauerkraut
would
go
well
yum
extremely
drinkable
less
dark
than
some
weizenbocks
ive
had
light
and
crisp
and
really
really
well
done
i
guess
when
youve
been
brewing
since
the
year
1040
you
figure
a
few
things
out
o
a
great
beer
by
the
ones
who
have
a
little
practice
brewing
like
the
spicy
off
shoot
from
typical
wheat
beers
maybe
in
all
weizenbocks
different
good
easily
drinkable
little
sneaky

a
must
try
every
beer
is
a
must
try
but
you
could
still
survive
still
if
you
missed
this
one
s
wow
kind
of
reminds
me
of
chorizo
de
san
manuel
upfront
this
is
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
weird
if
i
break
it
down
i
cloves
banana
rind
and
uncooked
grains
when
stirred
up
in
the
tulip
it
becomes
more
creamy
smelling
there
is
condensed
milk
in
the
nose
when
swirled
in
a
tulip
maybe
even
buttered
bread
in
the
taste
you
get
wheat
alcoholic
yeast
flavors
hay
bananas
and
sugar
very
complex
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
flowing
decent
carbonation
and
a
silky
finish
fantastic
beer
if
this
beer
wasnt
so
high
in
alcohol
i
could
drink
this
all
night
hell
next
paycheck
im
going
to
load
up
because
i
know
my
local
venue
hasnt
much
more
to
offer
do
the
drinkability
of
excellent
this
is
one
of
the
best
weizenbocks
ive
tasted
will
be
looking
forward
to
enjoying
a
few
more
as
we
head
into
the
summer
months
prost
a
very
good
brew
overall
one
which
i
would
definitely
buy
again
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
flavor
is
great
i
could
easily
drink
these
all
night
long
overall
i
think
it
is
a
very
nice
weizenbock
and
it
is
the
perfect
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
i
recommend
trying
this
and
i
will
definitely
be
buying
some
more
great
wheat
beer
the
look
is
golden
and
cloudy
great
head
retention
definate
clove
wheat
beer
smell
and
clove
taste
done
well
and
dangerously
well
hidden
abv
where
this
beer
stands
out
is
that
it
is
very
thick
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
it
works
very
well
and
the
beer
is
one
to
be
copied
i
personally
prefer
more
banana
flavor
but
on
sale
at

this
is
a
good

o
very
very
very
nice
beer
could
while
away
a
very
happy
summer
afternoon
sipping
on
these
terrific
aroma
with
a
taste
to
match
looks
and
feels
good
just
an
allround
good
beer
this
example
is
highly
drinkable
and
my
favorite
wheat
beer
to
date
a
pleasure
to
have
this
time
of
year
and
one
ill
be
enjoying
many
times
over
this
summer
o
great
weihenstephaner
specimen
refreshing
and
delicious
a
very
nice
weizenbock
stays
fairly
light
and
fruity
o
although
not
my
favorite
brew
i
had
but
damn
close
i
simply
cannot
see
a
fault
with
this
brew
it
looks
amazing
smells
insanely
good
taste
is
awesome
and
balanced
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
the
feel
is
super
light
and
fluffy
while
not
being
watery
at
all
the
appearance
alone
was
almost
enough
for
me
but
its
just
not
quite
there
excellent
fruity
and
spicy
scent
but
the
taste
has
something
im
not
quite
there
on
mouthfeel
is
delightful
as
this
dances
across
the
tongue
this
beer
is
definitely
alive
and
encourages
you
to
let
it
linger
for
a
bit
in
order
to
experience
everything
overall
rather
light
and
refreshing
in
taste
but
with
a
little
extra
kick
from
the
alcohol
content
this
is
right
up
there
with
their
more
wellknown
allstar
wheat
beer
perhaps
a
bit
more
bold
and
a
little
more
full
bodied
highly
recommended
o
first
weizenbock
i
have
ever
had
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
hefeweizen
with
more
alcohol
and
spice
o
a
great
beer
highly
drinkable
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
o
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
it
is
refined
and
elegant
while
delivering
lots
of
flavor
will
gladly
buy
this
again
properly
cloudy
unassuming
golden
canary
yellow
with
a
frail
snowy
white
head
the
aroma
overflows
with
banana
and
bubblegum
clove
sourdough
bread
pear
peach
and
bergamot
unbelievably
estery
and
very
enticing
the
flavor
disguises
its
strength
all
too
well
with
a
bready
sweetness
and
full
round
banana
fruitiness
a
shake
of
clove
a
touch
of
almond
and
a
limoncello
kick
very
smooth
though
it
could
be
fuller
overall
a
dangerously
drinkable
and
excellent
wheat
beer
m
smooth
and
heavily
carbonated
but
not
in
a
bad
way
an
interesting
contrast
to
another
weizenbock
like
aventinus
which
sits
on
the
other
side
of
the
flavour
spectrum
for
the
style
demonstrates
the
great
degree
of
variety
to
be
had
within
this
style
this
is
better
than
most
hefs
ive
tasted
a
great
warm
weather
beer
and
wildly
drinkable
for
the
abv
which
really
goes
almost
unnoticed
not
my
preferred
style
but
a
very
tasty
brew
o
i
cant
decided
which
weihenstephan
brew
i
love
more
needless
to
say
im
a
fan
it
still
maintains
the
awesome
drinkability
and
thirst
quenching
ability
from
its
lighter
body
counterpart
the
amazing
weihenstephaner
hefeweizen
o
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
all
the
usual
tastes
of
a
great
hefe
with
the
strength
and
balance
of
a
great
belgium
beer
down
right
amazing
pours
a
pale
mellow
yellow
with
a
twofinger
white
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
spice
clove
and
banana
big
sweet
sticky
flavor
banana
bubblegum
clove
sweet
orange
and
lemon
juice
also
sweet
bread
malt
really
big
and
sweet
a
little
bit
of
spice
kicks
through
but
ends
with
more
excellent
sticky
sweetness
a
good
weizenbock
which
can
be
drunk
best
when
the
temperature
is
higher
overall
very
good
but
a
notch
below
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
weihenstephaner
can
session
well
for
the
abv
doesnt
motivate
me
too
much
to
try
other
weizenbocks
but
i
probably
will
anyways
i
find
german
styles
interesting
and
am
really
trying
to
get
a
good
feel
of
what
to
expect
from
them
overall
a
great
beer
and
a
real
hallmark
of
the
style
fullbodied
complex
and
tasty
what
more
could
you
want
weihenstephaner
has
yet
to
fail
me
this
is
my
first
weizenbock
and
its
delicious
nice
appearance
with
an
expected
cloudy
wit
look
white
head
with
minimal
lacing
and
fingers
a
pleasant
floral
hop
aroma
very
active
on
the
mouth
and
tongue
a
beer
i
intend
to
keep
in
the
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
when
i
am
in
the
mood
the
beer
was
a
lemonade
yellow
color
with
a
huge
4
inch
head
that
was
white
and
foamy
it
smells
strongly
of
lemon
banana
clove
and
wheat
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
strong
on
clove
and
spice
along
with
banana
lemon
and
wheat
there
is
a
bit
of
yeast
in
the
aftertaste
the
beer
is
light
with
a
ton
of
soft
bubbly
carbonation
it
is
just
a
tad
warming
but
i
would
have
never
guessed
it
to
be
7

no
flaws
in
this
one
it
will
go
well
with
my
german
sausage
links
i
just
grilled
really
mellow
for
its
strength
yet
still
medium
bodied
and
full
of
cloves
lemons
bananas
and
even
a
little
apples
some
hot
alcohol
hits
you
up
front
slightly
tart
wheatiness
and
nice
vibrant
carbonation
definetly
getting
better
as
i
continue
drinking
and
as
it
warms
up
a
little
good
multi
bottle
drinking
beer
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
without
totally
overwhelming
your
palate
curious
to
try
the
adventinus
in
comparision
no
problems
finishing
this
good
stuff
drinkabilityoverall
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
not
as
good
as
the
aventinus
but
still
a
dang
good
beer
amazing
balance
and
subtlety
doesnt
taste

never

almost

one
of
the
best
weizens
ive
had
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
beer
has
some
serious
flavor
nice
clove
and
citrus
with
a
good
alcohol
warming
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
medium
light
with
a
punch
vitus
pours
a
very
surprisingly
light
golden
yellow
with
a
massive
fluffy
white
head
it
easily
fills
up
more
than
half
the
glass
but
fades
a
litle
too
quickly
for
my
taste
similarly
lacing
left
behind
is
a
bit
spotty
the
nose
is
extremely
powerful
and
smells
a
bit
like
a
hefeweizen
on
steroids
theres
an
additional
bit
of
mat
sweetness
though
to
balance
out
the
massive
banana
and
moreso
clove
the
extra
malt
shows
up
on
my
palate
as
well
as
theres
an
increased
vanilla
sweetness
from
having
more
wheat
in
the
grain
bill
theres
also
a
slight
warming
sensation
from
alcohol
which
is
a
solid
addition
to
the
beer
still
though
this
ones
a
massive
clovebanana
weiss
yeast
bomb
the
mouthfeel
is
truly
remarkable
though
im
half
convinced
that
weihenstephan
made
some
kind
of
deal
with
the
devil
to
get
a
body
this
light
on
a
beer
this
bigflavorful
carbonation
is
almost
frantic
without
becoming
overbearing
and
the
result
is
a
mouthfeel
that
is
the
definition
of
effervescent
vitus
basically
an
imperial
hefe
as
opposed
to
many
weizenbocks
incorporating
some
darker
malts
but
its
nonetheless
world
class
this
to
me
can
be
a
great
higher
alcohol
session
beer
its
extremely
tastey
and
drinkable
d
i
would
consider
getting
it
again
at
a
4
dollar
price
tag
i
felt
i
paid
too
much
but
drinking
it
fully
worth
the
price
if
you
can
find
it
cheaper
i
would
say
pick
it
up
16
9oz
brown
bottle
purchased
at
mckinnons
in
salem
pours
a
murky
yellow
body
with
a
good
two
inches
of
offwhite
head
smells
like
orange
pith
spice
and
banana
banana
pith
citrus
bread
and
nut
comprise
the
flavor
medium
to
full
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
very
drinkable
pleasant
and
complex
an
excellent
weizenbock
poured
into
a
wiezen
glass
nice
tight
creamy
white
head
and
thin
lacing
the
color
is
a
bright
pale
straw
hazy
and
not
a
great
deal
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
a
characteristic
hefe
smell
with
bananas
the
taste
is
bananas
and
a
thick
sweet
grainy
nectar
there
is
a
little
spicy
note
and
the
malt
leave
a
cloy
aftertaste
a
great
brew
from
a
traditional
bavarian
brewery
pretty
good
but
if
i
was
aventinus
i
wouldnt
be
too
worried
about
the
competition
this
was
a
good
choice
for
a
drink
today
where
it
was
pretty
warm
in
texas
like
ive
said
wheat
beers
arent
a
favorite
of
mine
so
i
wont
appreciate
this
as
much
as
someone
else
who
does
like
weizenbiers
terrible
germanenglish
but
i
can
tell
a
quality
beer
and
this
one
is
it
d
another
worldclass
brew
from
weihenstephaner
awesome
medium
bodied
prickly
carbonation
and
nearly
undetectable
alcohol
come
together
for
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
this
is
such
an
amazing
beer
especially
for
the
price
point
if
only
the
weather
was
a
bit
warmer
out
i
think
id
be
enjoying
this
even
more
d
a
great
way
to
settle
the
tastebuds
down
a
couple
hours
after
eating
some
pot
roast
and
spicy
baked
beans
do
yourself
a
favor
and
let

2
weihenstephaner
vitus
with
a
nice
kielbasa
or
knish
dinner
ensemble
i
poured
this
one
into
my
founders
snifter
the
appearance
is
a
golden
cloudy
murky
dulled
orange
with
a
one
finger
bright
white
head
it
looks
near
identical
to
their
hefe
it
smells
of
wheat
yeast
coriander
light
spices
and
some
orange
i
didnt
expect
that
its
definitely
interesting
it
tastes
of
yeast
and
oranges
with
a
hint
of
cloves
and
banana
its
actually
pretty
similar
to
the
hefe
it
drinks
exceptionally
smooth
and
medium
in
body
the
only
knock
is
that
it
can
be
a
little
sweet
at
times
overall
its
another
good
beer
from
weihenstephaner
the
color
when
poured
was
a
light
hazy
yellow
with
loads
of
foam
and
some
lace
of
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
yeast
bananas
and
a
hint
of
allspice
the
flavor
was
the
same
as
the
aroma
beauitfully
balanced
of
fruit
and
spices
along
with
the
yeasty
bread
flavor
sort
of
creamy
with
a
sweetbitter
balance
that
is
so
pleasant
that
just
thinking
about
the
next
sip
makes
your
mouth
water
what
a
pleasant
surprise
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
an
inch
of
fluffy
foam
looks
great
smell
is
fruity
bananas
stand
out
the
most
some
citrus
and
spice
taste
is
fruity
a
little
bit
sweet
but
in
good
balance
finishes
pretty
dry
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
carbonation
is
spot
on
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
this
is
a
dangerous
beer
if
you
have
a
bunch
in
the
fridge
on
a
hot
day
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
to
drink
while
outside
grilling
for
some
reason
just
something
about
it
great
brewery
great
beer
great
price
this
beer
is
amazing
the
spice
plus
the
banana
character
makes
this
mindboggling
delicious
i
think
this
is
moving
up
into
my
alltime
top
ten
and
everytime
i
drink
one
i
realize
just
how
awesome
it
is
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
weizen
glass
hazy
yellowgold
with
very
big
head
no
lacing
lots
of
banana
clove
on
the
nose
lots
of
very
ripe
banana
with
enough
clove
for
moderation
it
has
a
sweet
lingering
finish
this
is
an
easy
drinker
a
damn
fine
beer
my
new
go
to
wheat
beer
cheers
vitus
is
very
belgian
in
character
sweet
flavorful
drinkable
but
maybe
a
bit
out
of
style
flavor
is
light
hints
of
vanilla
clementines
and
golden
delicious
apples
all
is
brought
together
in
a
tart
just
slightly
bitter
finish
which
cleanses
the
pallate
for
another
sip
and
you
want
that
next
sip
this
beer
take
the
heffe
experience
and
cleans
it
up
into
a
less
wheatyfunky
brew
not
that
i
dont
like
heffes
but
this
is
a
great
brew
and
style
unto
itself
and
this
is
an
outstanding
example
i
want
more
of
these
d
very
drinkable
beer
no
harshness
poured
from
a
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
vibrant
bubbly
gold
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
about
1
inch
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
film
over
the
course
of
a
minute
or
two
the
aromas
blast
out
from
the
bottle
as
you
pour
smells
of
flowers
coriander
and
sweet
fruit
the
beer
has
a
heavy
spice
forward
flavor
with
the
coriander
and
possibly
pepper
riding
on
top
of
a
round
sweet
malty
foundation
bits
of
citrus
throughout
maybe
orange
and
grapefruit
but
hard
to
pinpoint
with
the
spices
the
beer
is
full
and
bold
in
mouth
with
a
transition
to
a
slightly
sour
spicy
aftertaste
the
citrus
notes
linger
through
to
the
end
also
and
make
your
mouth
pucker
a
bit
when
added
to
the
sour
notes
the
finish
is
a
bit
dry
and
makes
you
eager
for
that
next
mouthful
good
flavors
and
complex
mouthfeel
make
this
a
pretty
good
damn
beer
in
my
book
hazy
strawyellow
colored
body
topped
by
thick
rather
low
white

that
slowly
recedes
and
sticks
to
the
walls
weizenbock
is
essentially
a
dunkelweizen
brewed
to
the
strength
of
a
doppelbock
however
the
pale
visual
appearance
of
vitus
is
reminiscent
more
of
a
hefeweizen
than
dunkleweizen
aroma
is
doppelbocklike
sweetness
with
banana
esters
clove
phenolics
and
bready
malt
a
careful
sniffing
session
reveals
plum
raisinlike
fruitiness
that
gets
more
prominent
as
the
beer
warms
very
faint
alcohol
shines
through
flavor
is
rich
sweetness
suggesting
the
malt
hasnt
beet
fermented
thoroughly
with
banana
clove
and
wheat
hop
flavor
is
virtually
absent
and
the
finish
is
somewhat
balanced
by
light
hoppy
bitterness
and
very
faint
alcohol
the
palate
is
sweet
body
mediumfull
with
very
smooth
creamy
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
as
stated
above
the
appearance
of
vitus
resembles
a
good
hefeweizen
although
it
is
easily
distinguished
from
the
later
by
having
a
minor
head
and
fuller
body
there
could
be
more
melanoidin
dark
fruit
character
but
its
a
very
decent
beer
nevertheless
overall
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
if
you
havnt
noticed
yet
i
much
prefer
this
to
the
hefe
which
i
find
almost
cloying
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
recomended
i
have
the
aventinus
up
next
we
shall
see
which
is
better
this
is
my
100th
review
and
i
am
proud
that
it
is
such
a
great
beer
weihenstephaner
makes
so
many
great
beers
everything
i
have
tried
from
th
has
been
phenomenal
and
this
is
no
different
i
recently
tried
a
few
weizenbocks
and
can
now
say
that
this
is
my
favorite
it
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
color
with
a
tall
off
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
leaving
some
lacing
in
my
glass
smell
is
mostly
wheat
but
there
also
notes
of
banana
and
clove
taste
is
similar
complex
with
wheat
bready
malt
banana
and
clove
notes
and
a
touch
of
hops
it
is
sort
of
fruity
and
spicy
but
the
backbone
is
still
the
wheat
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
with
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
superb
this
beer
is
everything
i
love
about
hefeweizens
dunkelweizens
and
maibocks
rolled
into
one
balanced
perfectly
and
with
just
the
right
mouthfeel
great
beer
d
this
beer
is
a
winner
i
cant
believe
i
didnt
try
it
until
now
the
overall
profile
is
very
similar
to
this
brewerys
hefe
weizenonly
its
the
imperial
version
the
broadness
of
the
weizenbock
style
never
ceases
to
amaze
mebut
if
there
were
a
classic
examplethis
would
be
it
dno
way
this
is
7

abv
extremely
sessionable
drinkability
3

very
tasty
but
the
flavors
are
strong
and
there
is
a
bit
of
booziness
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
although
never
that
discernible
in
the
taste
i
could
put
these
down
quickly
but
would
be
feeling
it
just
as
quickly
d
feels
like
a
lightly
caramelized
hefe
and
perhaps
slightly
more
phenolic
and
definitely
heavier
you
cant
go
wrong
with
drinkability
on
a
weihenstephaner
with
their
world
class
flavors
and
feel
however
if
i
wanted
something
more
refreshing
i
will
stick
with
the
brewerys
hefe
weissbier

cloudy

color
with
a
very
large
head
that
held
on
for
a
long
time
a
weizenbock
that
looks
identical
to
a
hefeweizen
instead
of
being
much
darker
just
a
little
lacing
is
left
on
my
weizen
glass
big
brassy
hefeweizen
aromas
here
hints
of
banana
cloves
and
a
little
granery
dust
aroma
flavor
is
huge
wheat
beer
bananas
and
bubblegum
with
just
a
small
dose
of
cloves
if
you
are
a
fan
of
weizens
then
this
beer
is
a
must
for
you
a
little
darker
malt
may
have
complimented
this
beer
further
but
it
is
quite
sucessful
as
is
one
of
the
more
fuller
wheat
beers
i
have
had
carbonation
is
just
a
tick
low
as
it
seems
just
a
little
flat
but
otherwise
has
a
nice
texture
for
some
reason
this
beer
does
not
make
it
to
the
minnesota
market
i
wish
it
did
this
is
balance
well
for
all
the
banana
emphasis
but
im
surprised
by
the
lack
of
any
clove
phenols
doesnt
seem
too
much
of
a
weizenbock
its
pretty
tame
notes
this
one
is
worth
picking
up
and
can
usually
be
found
for
a
great
value
complex
in
every
aspect
yet
simple
enough
for
even
the
most
inexperience
beer
drinker
to
enjoy
drink
im
going
to
keep
this
in
the
rotation
cant
believe
ive
never
tried
this
before
as
i
just
picked
it
up
on
a
whim
overall
what
was
best
about
this
brew
was
its
classically
weizenbock
aroma
it
contains
all
of
the
sweet
and
wheaty
characteristics
anything
in
the
style
should
and
while
admittedly
complex
maintains
a
delicious
simplicity
to
the
flavors
what
was
curious
if
anything
was
the
huge
attention
to
esters
with
the
specificity
of
ripe
bananas
which
were
observable
at
nearly
every
turn
the
vitus
is
simply
superb
tastes
mediumsweet
with
nice
spiciness
as
a
counterpoint
strong
carbonation
helps
keep
the
sweet
from
sticking
clove
nutmeg
and
canned
pear
syrup
finishes
with
a
sharp
sting
from
the
carbonation
meh
drinkability
light
body
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
weihenstephaner
and
a
huge
fan
of
weis
beers
and
this
beer
confirms
why
it
has
a
wonderful
aroma
flavors
that
are
balanced
and
elegant
and
a
nice
crisp
dryer
finish
though
there
is
a
tinge
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
it
is
hard
to
believe
the
7
7
percent
alcohol
labeled
on
the
bottle
once
again
an
amazing
beer
by
weihenstephaner
md
perfect
carbonation
here
this
beer
drinks
like
water
d
i
wanted
a
good
weizenbock
for
the
cold
weather
i
was
leaning
towards
aventis
but
then
i
saw
this
its
definitely
worth
a
drink
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
long
time
even
though
its
not
my
favorite
style
mostly
because
of
coloradobobs
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
hazy
golden
hue
in
the
center
large
white
tops
things
off
and
recedes
slowly
typical
wheat
beer
smell
mostly
banana
and
clove
with
a
touch
of
pale
malt
and
slightly
hoppyherbal
background
but
this
mostly
about
the
sweet
wheat
taste
is
wonderful
delicious
citrusy
notes
banana
as
in
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
perhaps
some
licorice
on
the
dry
finish
i
really
like
that
this
weizenbock
is
not
a
dunkel
variety
this
tastes
like
a
standard
hefe
with
the
flavor
and
booze
ramped
up
just
a
few
notches
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
at
first
but
it
starts
to
settle
down
midglass
with
some
gentle
swirling
medium
body
good
stuff
here
very
drinkable
despite
the
higher
abv
vitus
pours
a
hazy
golden
coloralso
starts
out
with
a
nice
head
the
taste
has
cloves
and
banana
flavor
with
a
small
hint
of
lemon
this
is
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
all
evening
as
far
as
drinkiability
i
also
like
the
design
of
the
labels
on
the
bottles
too
hey
i
can
dig
it
great
beer
for
any
time
of
the
year
i
was
at
one
with
the
world
while
drinking
this
beauty
the
7
7abv
just
sits
within
the
flavours
without
being
noticed
a
truely
amazing
and
oneoff
beer
as
coloradobobs
has
been
telling
me
for
years
drinkability
for
ya
boy
aint
the
bees
knees
if
ya
feel
me
for
me
ya
boy
its
a
bit
too
potent
in
the
banana
area
see
bananas
are
just
too
damn
bland
for
me
i
like
my
fruits
to
be
pippy
and
tasty
not
long
ya
feel
me
yeah
you
feel
me
this
is
a
review
that
you
should
take
zero
advice
from
though
as
its
a
well
loved
beer
i
just
dont
like
penis
fruit
blasts
take
me
ill
follow
you
summarizing
it
poured
from
the
growler
with
an
initial
swell
of
soft
creamy
head
but
it
soon
deflated
leaving
a
thin
misty
blanket
of
suds
on
top
of
the
as
i
mentioned
autumnorange
tinged
body
hazy
bordering
on
cloudy
freshbaked
doughy
bread
aromas
with
faintly
sticky
navel
orange
notes
as
well
the
alcohol
is
wonderfully
obfuscated
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
too
not
even
causing
much
of
a
stir
in
the
finish
the
moderate
yet
assertive
breadiness
and
esters
balance
out
superbly
really
forming
the
backbone
of
the
taste
tartness
from
the
wheat
kept
in
check
just
about
a
whisper
and
as
i
also
said
the
best
in
every
facet
of
this
beer
comes
to
the
fore
when
its
lost
its
chill
a
wholly
satisfying
smooth
and
hearty
feel
at
the
same
time
finishing
light
and
refreshing
for
the
style
let
it
warm
to
where
its
actually
almost
warm
and
youll
get
the
most
out
of
it
quite
enjoyable
quintessentially
german
dthis
is
a
nice
wheat
beer
and
easily
drinkable
and
refreshing
enjoyed
around
a
bonfire
on
a
warm
november
night
in
ohio
this
beer
pours
a
surprisingly
pale
and
fairly
clear
yellow
with
a
thick
pillowy
head
this
was
the
first
time
that
ive
had
this
beer
and
was
surprised
by
how
pale
it
was
aroma
is
of
strong
banana
clove
and
wheat
this
is
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
that
ive
had
not
very
surprising
for
a
weihenstephaner
wheat
beer
the
flavor
is
similar
to
an
imperialized
hefeweizen
strong
banana
and
very
strong
clove
wheat
is
present
but
is
not
as
strong
as
the
regular
weihenstephaner
hefe
just
a
tinge
of
faint
cocoa
is
noted
at
the
end
of
the
swallow
simply
fantastic
drinkability
is
incredibly
high
for
a
7
7
abv
beer
its
hard
to
drink
this
beer
slow
its
so
good
highly
recommended
for
hefeweizen
lovers
i
really
want
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
again
because
i
love
wweihenstephaner
and
it
just
didnt
seem
right
chad
overall
excellent
beer
overall
another
fine
offering
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
verdict
excellent
and
superwellpriced
brew
must
find
moutfeel
has
a
medium
body
feel
to
it
but
is
slightly
sticky
and
chewy
overall
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
and
a
classic
example
of
the
style
drinkability
came
for
the
weizenbock
stayed
for
the
frankenstein
hefeweizen
a
bold
beer
fans
of
either
style
should
try
this
note
after
about
an
hour
the
remainder
in
the
glass
was
a
little
limp
and
lifeless
still
a
drink
if
it
wasnt
a
7
7
and
me
carving
pumpkins
all
night
i
would
have
had
another
one
but
big
abv
and
big
knives
dont
mix
cloudy
straw
yellow
brew
gives
a
velvety
smooth
white
head
3
in
height
that
settles
slowly
to
leave
a
bit
of
lace
behind
smell
is
zesty
and
a
little
sour
with
wheat
spices
and
sharp
citrus
taste
and
feel
is
like
a
concentrated
hefeweizen
a
bunch
of
astringent
banana
peel
and
warm
clove
with
a
pleasant
alcohol
spice
moderately
thick
and
mostly
dry
body
with
a
robust
and
slightly
fizzy
carbonation
unmistakably
german
very
good
beer
but
seems
very
filling
and
is
a
little
too
harsh
for
a
wheat
beer
in
my
opinion
doesnt
match
the
mighty
hefeweissbier
though
the
flavor
is
pretty
close
i
prefer
the
subtlety
and
easy
drinking
of
the
hefe
d
everything
their
hefeweizen
is
and
more
a
wonderful
beer
all
around
and
a
new
favorite
i
would
buy
this
by
the
case
if
i
could
drinkability
i
couldnt
keep
the
smile
off
my
face
as
i
drained
this
glass
it
was
more
like
an
uberhefe
than
a
weizenbock
imo
as
i
got
none
of
the
traditional
bock
characteristics
since
their
hefe
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
though
and
this
was
that
just
more
of
the
same
i
have
to
give
this
a
gigantic
thumbs
up
ive
had
several
of
these
brewerys
beers
and
this
is
right
in
line
with
my
expectations
as
regards
their
quality
super
drinkable
very
tasty
and
overall
just
a
wellcrafted
wheat
beer
one
of
the
better
wheat
beers
ive
ever
had
actually
danother
genredefining
beer
from
weihenstephaner
o
another
great
beer
from
weihenstephan
almost
on

something
to
seek
out
poured
from
a

9
oz
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
a
cloudy
dark
hay
like
color
aroma
is
of
soft
banana
banana
and
clove
flavors
with
a
light
spicy
hop
character
just
a
hint
of
citrus
some
bready
malt
pulls
through
and
over
all
there
is
little
bitterness
alcohol
is
tame
but
there
a
hell
of
a
beer
almost
like
a
hefeweizen
on
steroids
transparent
she
is
not
but
at
first
sip
all
of
her
mysteries
are
revealed
the
strong
wheat
malt
the
veluptuous
mouthfeel
and
the
sexy
spices
she
is
also
quite
the
dominatrix

youll
lose

in

okay
with
it
drinkability
i
am
a
slut
for
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
forever
and
probably
die
of
alcohol
poisoning
in
the
process
because
the
alcohol
is
hidden
so
well
well
worth
the
hype
pours
an
extremely
beautifully
cloudy
goldenhay
color
with
nice
white
head
scent
is
absolutely
amazing
such
amazing
clove
banana
apple
and
peach
scents
that
are
crazy
bold
for
how
cold
this
beer
is
right
now
cant
imagine
what
its
like
warm
taste
is
just
as
it
smells
i
think
i
just
fell
in
love
why
have
i
never
bought
this
beer
before
i
always
pass
it
up
needs
to
have
more
hype
if
you
ask
me
such
amazing
fruit
flavors
im
getting
green
apples
pears
peaches
melon
and
white
grapes
i
also
get
bold
clove
flavors
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
due
to
the
nice
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
extremely
high
im
very
shocked
with
this
beer
right
now
will
definitely
be
drinking
more
of
this
d
a
fantastic
beer
its
drinkability
belies
the
relatively
high
abv
a
pint
bottle
of
this
has
me
feeling
it
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
of
this
throughout
the
fall
a
truly
wellbalanced
and
well
done
beer
a
bit
too
hefty
in
abv
for
drinking
in
large
proportions
sampled
at
beer
tasting
at
de
klomp
linköping
sweden
for
some
reason
going
into
this
beer
i
thought
a
weizenbock
was
gonna
look
like
a
hazy
doppelbock
boy
could
i
be
more
wrong
golden
yelloworange
with
a
generous
egg
shell
hefe
head
looks
like
a
hefe
but
much
stronger
smelling
tons
of
banana
and
pear
much
the
same
with
taste
with
yeasts
and
some
spiciness
from
the
alcohol
lucious
creamy
mouthfeel
very
solid
and
drinkable
my
first
weizenbock
and
an
enjoyable
experience
just
like
a
hefe
only
stronger
in
all
aspects
surprised
by
the
light
color
of
this
its
a
hazy
hay
yellow
and
develops
a
substantial
fluffy
head
smells
fantastic
with
something
pretty
sharp
in
there
almost
sourlike
taste
is
like
a
snowballing
hefe
in
that
it
seems
to
build
in
shape
and
momentum
as
it
goes
down
its
got
a
big
kick
yet
ends
pretty
light
thanks
to
the
high
carbonation
it
has
a
wonderful
effect
where
the
snap
of
yeast
combines
with
the
bubbles
to
give
an
attentiongrabbing
finish
theres
really
not
a
tremendous
amount
of
flavor
on
the
front
but
it
really
picks
up
midway
on
the
body
is
boisterously
fluffy
reminding
me
of
belgian
strong
pale
theres
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
as
well
as
some
fruit
notes
possibly
pear
or
apple
this
is
an
amped
up
hefe
if
im
not
mistaken
and
its
likely
my
first
somehow
i
doubt
i
will
drink
another
one
that
surpasses
or
even
rivals
this
one
finally
saw
this
beer
while
down
in
iowa
so
picked
one
up
kind
of
different
than
other
weizenbocks
ive
had
maybe
a
little
more
straightforward
sweetness
and
less
fruit
and
clove
than
others
maybe
it
was
a
little
older
but
still
quite
tasty
hazy
honey
amber
creamy
white
head
on
top
average
smell
for
style
very
light
doesnt
reveal
to
much
tastes
of
clove
light
malt
some
wheatiness
with
some
dark
fruitiness
a
little
alcohol
present
in
this
one
very
drinkable
could
definitely
get
into
a
few
of
these
a
little
too
quickly
cleam
mouthfeel
crisp
price
3
50
a
worthy
beer
and
warranted
to
gain
cult
status
not
one
flavor
tries
to
steamroll
another
which
makes
it
dangerously
drinkable
just
fine
on
its
own
but
begs
to
be
paired
with
a
fullon
cheese
fondue
of
emmental
and
jarlsberg
and
a
crusty
baguette
drinkability
high
quality
this
is
superb
beer
and
it
proudly
showcases
the
craftsmanship
of
its
brewers
vitus
is
a
testament
to
weihenstephans
longevity
in
the
beer
world
dvery
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
sitting
with
a
smile
on
my
face
the
taste
stays
its
wonderful
drinkability
what
do
you
mean
this
is
7
7
no
alcohol
is
present
whatsoever
its
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
me
but
i
could
easily
down
many
of
these
well
worth
the
3
price
tag
hell
id
pay
7
for
one
and
itd
still
be
worth
it
after
looking
for
this
one
in
nc
for
over
a
year
with
no
luck
i
turned
to
wagenvolks
for
a
bottle
500ml
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
pours
a
murky
pale
yellow
with
a
very
frothy
off
white
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
slight
laving
on
the
glass
aroma
is
loads
of
sweet
fruits
banana
and
spices
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
fruits
and
malts
with
a
nice
side
of
spices
nice
and
complex
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
crisp
with
nice
carbonation
and
well
hidden
alcohol
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
weizenbock
very
true
to
style
and
quite
tasty
overall
this
is
an
excellent
weizenbock
and
highly
worth
your
time
to
hunt
down
if
you
enjoy
wheat
beers
pours
an
extremely
foggy
dark
gold
to
light
amber
colored
body
topped
by
a
frumpy
white
head
with
excellent
retention
its
aromas
are
very
spicy
and
wheaty
tons
of
cloves
hit
my
nose
right
up
front
with
subtler
nutmeggy
notes
and
the
promise
of
sweet
wheat
to
come
taste
is
delicious
beyond
delicious
practically
want
to
you
close
your
eyes
and
purr
rich
flavors
but
none
of
them
unruly
or
overbearing
taste
is
almost
entirely
consistent
with
the
nose
except
that
dark
fruit
notes
like
plumbs
or
dates
enter
the
mix
especially
on
the
finish
body
gently
unfolds
upon
touching
the
tongue
going
from
lightly
tingly
to
luxuriously
creamy
and
mouthfilling
all
within
the
space
of
a
second
one
of
the
best
slowsippers
for
reading
a
book
or
enjoying
a
nightcap
that
ive
encountered
positively
delectable
notes
definitely
not
like
other
weizenbocks
that
i
have
had
seems
more
like
a
bigger
hefeweizen
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
wasnt
entirely
balanced
and
not
what
i
was
expecting
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
better
given
the
track
record
of
this
brewery
about
2
is
tops
on
this
a
great
tasting
beer
but
the
combination
of
it
being
full
bodied
at
7
alcohol
is
going
to
knock
it
down
a
bit
in
this
category
a
fantastic
brew
this
one
should
be
enjoyed
best
by
itself
to
appreciate
the
complexity
beware
the
alcohol
content
as
it
sneaks
up
without
a
hint
of
its
presence
well
worth
trying
for
any
beer
lover
out
there
d
so
far
to
put
this
the
easy
way
i
have
not
found
a
weihenstephaner
beer
i
dont
like
this
was
a
very
easy
half
liter
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
basically
a
stronger
version
of
weihenstephaners
regulkar
hefe
as
opposed
to
a
beefedup
dunkelweizen
still
a
great
beer
the
stronger
alcohol
adds
a
new
dimension
to
an
already
great
beer
id
have
this
again
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
overall
i
really
dig
this
beer
i
expected
it
to
sit
a
lot
heavier
than
it
did
enjoyed
on
many
occasions
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
cloudy
opaque
straw
yellow
in
the
glass
with
a
large
white
head
that
retains
nicely
fruity
mildly
phenolic
and
bready
aroma
this
smells
just
like
baking
banana
bread
and
ripe
lemons
the
aroma
is
wrapped
in
a
leafy
hop
character
that
comes
out
more
as
the
beer
warms
on
the
tongue
its
spicy
peppery
bringing
to
mind
pureed
banana
with
white
pepper
and
clove
moderate
bubblegum
sweetness
leads
into
a
spicy
and
dry
finish
its
surprisingly
drinkable
and
even
refreshing
for
a
7
7
beer
which
may
be
the
beers
most
impressive
attribute
while
i
prefer
weihenstephans
more
subtle
and
light
hefeweizen
this
is
very
enjoyable
d
this
was
pretty
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
but
with
the
halfliter
serving
size
and
the
deceptive
abv
im
not
sure
itd
be
a
good
idea
to
have
too
many
the
bottle
price
is
a
huge
steal
if
you
can
find
it
fresh
i
could
have
one
or
drink
this
beer
all
night
either
way
im
a
happy
camper
insanely
drinkable
for
a
relatively
high
abv
beer
i
can
see
having
a
few
of
these
in
a
bar
would
be
a
bad
idea
sitting
at
home
i
could
probably
have
severa
l
in
a
sitting
and
seem
fine
then
pay
the
cost
the
next
day
however
i
just
dont
find
this
to
be
that
compelling
of
a
beer
too
bad
as
id
heard
a
lot
about
it
and
was
rather
jazzed
to
discover
it
around
here
its
hard
to
believe
that
this
beer
cant
be
found
around
here
where
i
live
first
thing
i
noticed
after
pouring
into
a
aventinus
glass
is
how
light
it
is
compared
to
others
of
the
stylealmost
peachlike
in
color
with
a
great
creamy
top
aromas
of
mild
clove
and
bananaa
tinge
of
honey
sweetness
as
wellno
alcohol
trace
to
be
found
a
vey
creamy
feel
really
is
nicealmost
airy
in
nature
flavors
of
chocolate
dipped
bananas
and
clovea
lightly
toast
wheat
malt
flavor
comes
in
the
finish
this
is
traditional
and
not
in
your
facei
like
them
in
your
face
usually
but
this
is
really
a
great
brew
this
is
not
a
weizenbock
and
that
is
the
biggest
issue
for
me
it
was
also
out
of
balance
for
the
style
and
was
just
way
too
wheaty
with
not
evenough
malt
balance
not
my
favorite
style
not
my
favorite
beer
and
definitely
not
typical
of
the
style
if
you
want
a
weizenbock
stil
to
aventinus
its
perfect
why
mess
with
perfection
drinkability
pretty
good
lighter
than
aventinus
and
not
quite
as
good
but
still
a
really
enjoyable
weizenbock
more
on
the
hefeweizen
side
theyve
got
this
for
a
good
price
down
the
street
now
so
you
can
bet
that
ive
already
stocked
up
drinkability
i
really
like
this
beer
i
am
a
true
hefe
lover
but
this
variant
will
be
on
my
short
list
d
i
think
i
still
like
their
regular
hefeweizen
a
bit
better
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
i
might
have
to
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
the
flavor
is
very
much
like
a
bigger
version
of
thier
hefeweizen
lots
and
lots
of
banana
and
cloves
i
do
get
alot
more
alcohol
in
this
one
really
it
is
a
terrific
beer
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
with
just
a
slight
alcohol
presence
quite
drinkable
apparently
the
weizenbock
style
has
some
interpretation
depending
on
brewery
aventinus
seems
to
sway
to
the
bockdoppelbock
side
whereas
this
seems
to
stay
on
the
weizen
side
of
the
style
i
love
aventinus
but
until
now
other
weizenbocks
had
been
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
this
reminded
me
a
good
deal
of
aventinus
and
will
certainly
be
something
i
buy
again
d
pretty
drinkable
despite
the
high
alcohol
percentage
overall
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
i
know
weihenstephaner
does
good
things
but
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
this
brew
as
much
as
i
did
definitely
worth
picking
up
and
i
think
im
going
to
check
out
a
few
more
of
their
brews
after
having
this
one
a
tad
bit
boozy
but
its
not
a
harshness
that
hinders
too
much
but
rather
adds
to
the
complexity
the
sweet
vanilla
and
bready
flavors
balance
out
the
spicy
yeast
characteristics
nicely
a
wonderful
brew
that
helps
to
define
what
i
love
about
beer
d
i
could
take
2
or
3
of
this
one
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
spices
and
fruits
taste
is
great
banana
other
fruit
spices
very
complex
alcohol
is
well
hidden
feels
full
bodied
and
delicious
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
high
quality
beer
overall
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
when
compared
to
the
likes
of
aventinus
it
reminds
me
of
just
how
much
diversity
there
can
be
between
quality
beers
within
the
weizenbock
style
highly
recommended
f
slightly
sweet
on
the
finish
lingering
but
sweet
malts
not
syrupy
at
all
semi
bitter
with
a
little
orange
peel
lemon
zest
and
citrus
banana
as
well
with
more
wheat
lingering
a
slight
lingering
alcohol
burn
actually
comes
through
finishes
pretty
clean
and
quickly
a
little
vanilla
is
really
long
as
well
again
very
similar
to
most
weihenstephaner
beers
but
a
little
heavier
darker
and
boozier
this
one
this
one
also
finishes
slightly
sweet
rather
than
dry
d
well
worth
the
drive
to
campbelltown
i
should
have
taken
a
growler
home
with
me
the
idea
of
a
hellesweizenbock
has
grown
on
me
d
reminds
me
of
a
really
good
german
weizen
with
some
stronger
notes
of
clove
and
a
bigger
alcohol
presence
too
drinkable
for
its
strength
this
is
a
good
brew
that
went
down
rapidly
quite
the
weizenbock
weihenstephaners
helles
version
of
the
style
is
much
more
refreshing
than
more
traditional
examples
and
is
extremely
wellbalanced
never
too
strong
in
any
region
except
for
the
flavor
front
in
which
such
a
balance
between
taste
and
drinkability
is
a
powerful
virtue
perhaps
one
of
the
greatest
weizenbocks
around
brauerei
weihenstephan
never
ceases
to
produce
solid
wellcrafted
and
tasty
beers
while
remaining
in
strict
well
perhaps
not
so
strict
we
are
talking
about
wheat
beer
after
all
accordance
with
the
reinheitsgebot
vitus
is
flatout
amazing
and
well
worth
all
its
praise
d
not
bad
but
not
what
i
hoped
it
would
be
either
glad
to
have
easy
access
to
other
examples
of
what
is
rapidly
becoming
a
favorite
style
of
mine
value
great
far
better
than
beers
way
more
expensive
in
the
style
pours

10

for
a
500ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
d
the
smell
taste
and
body
of
this
beer
make
this
a
true
winner
to
session
with
cant
think
of
one
much
better
for
the
springsummer
d
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
and
its
extremely
easy
to
drink
d
i
liked
this
weizen
a
lot
great
smell
and
taste
and
the
only
thing
that
really
hurt
it
was
the
high
carbonation
would
definitely
have
again
not
my
favorite
style
and
not
my
favorite
beer
but
typical
of
the
style
d
wow
this
beer
is
world
class
for
sure
one
of
the
most
amazing
things
that
has
touched
my
lips
in
a
while
a
truely
amazing
beer
now
i
just
gotta
find
a
place
in
mn
that
sells
it
overall
excellent
beer
vitus
great
value
2
99
for
a
16
9oz
bottle
a
good
tasting
weizenbock
overall
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
i
would
definitely
order
again
at
a
bar
but
probably
wouldnt
stock
my
fridge
with
similar
to
ayinger
weizenbock
great
creamy
mouthfeel
this
a
a
very
well
crafted
beer
but
its
almost
too
intense
to
enjoy
more
than
one
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
wish
i
had
tried
sooner
i
will
certainly
be
having
it
again
and
so
should
you
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
has
a
opaque
light
honey
color
with
an
initially
thick
bubbly
and
foamy
white
head
aroma
was
pretty
strong
in
sweet
grain
and
malts
taste
was
a
mix
of
spice
cloves
some
banana
bread
and
alcohol
great
carbonation
and
thickness
i
could
drink
these
anytime
d
excellent
drinkability
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
love
to
have
with
brunch
on
a
nice
spring
morning
i
love
this
beer
its
one
of
my
favorite
german
beers
it
drives
me
crazy
that
i
only
know
3
places
in
berlin
to
buy
it
and
two
of
them
are
bars
its
probably
not
the
best
beer
if
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
in
one
night
as
its
slightly
heavy
but
in
terms
of
germanys
exotic
beers
i
find
this
one
the
best
one
of
my
favorite
wheat
beers
vitus
is
a
triumph
of
bavarian
art
dvery
refreshing
after
a
hot
day
even
with
a
higher
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
i
would
gladly
drink
again
wonderful
weizenbock
with
pleasant
and
is
very
drinkable
this
one
is
absolutely
top
beer
as
it
should
be
drinkability
its
tasty
and
feels
good
but
it
also
is
really
hitting
my
gut
like
a
bomb
usually
heavy
beers
dont
disable
me
like
this
but
this
one
does
otherwise
a
very
nice
beer
indeed
na
zdravje
or
in
this
case
prost
cheers
dthis
is
very
tasty
the
flavor
is
slightly
watered
down
compared
to
the
nose
but
still
extremely
solid
great
flavors
working
well
together
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
i
like
it
a
lot
this
is
a
fine
fine
beer
it
suffers
in
my
mental
perception
for
not
being
a
worthy
opponent
to
aventinus
but
ignoring
that
very
different
weizenbock
will
allow
you
to
enjoy
what
vitus
brings
to
the
table
i
cant
say
ive
had
too
many
weizenbocks
before
victory
moonglow
and
weyerbacher
slam
dunkel
are
the
only
two
that
come
to
mind
but
this
beer
really
is
flavorful
and
full
of
character
id
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
d
this
is
easy
on
the
palate
crisp
smooth
refreshing
tasty
i
could
easily
drink
some
more
of
these
nice
to
drink
on
a
weizenbock
starter
brew
day
for
inspiration
less
sediment
than
expected
may
not
be
the
best
candidate
for
a
yeast
harvest
i
would
use
sierra
kellerweis
before
vituss
wow
absolutely
terrific
poured
up
a
pale
yellow
colour
with
a
bit
of
cloudiness
almost
white
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
a
lamp
head
is
looselyknit
white
suds
that
fade
away
after
a
few
moments
leaving
only
a
blanket
of
frost
smell
is
an
explosion
of
spice
with
a
bit
of
an
earthy
mustiness
very
nice
taste
too
is
big
spice
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
towards
the
finish
this
drinks
a
little
bit
below
the
advertised
77
and
has
a
moderately
carbonated
mouthfeel
a
very
very
solidly
crafted
weizenbock
and
a
wellbuilt
beer
in
its
own
right
impressive
pours
a
cloudy
maize
color
on
top
and
a
hazy
pale
yellow
on
bottom
one
and
one
half
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
yeast
hops
citrus
clove
and
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
weizenbock
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
sweet
malt
citrus
and
slight
tart
malt
overall
good
aroma
blend
body
but
too
much
effervescence
meant
to
get
a
dunkles
but
this
is
nice
to
have
a
around
especially
at
77abv
pleasantly
drinkable
with
a
full
flavor
profile
too
easy
to
drink
for
the
7

the
bottle
boasts
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
thick
if
not
too
persistent
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
strong
yeasty
and
a
little
lemony
with
malty
and
rubbery
hints
refreshing
flavor
is
crisp
malty
yeasty
and
lemony
with
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
texture
is
strongly
tingly
yet
it
slides
smoothly
down
the
pipes
it
leaves
a
nice
tingle
on
the
tongue
and
inside
the
lips
poured
into
an
ennglish
style
pint
glass
the
appearance
surprised
me
very
light
for
this
style
very
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
while
before
going
into
a
thin
film
with
minimal
lacing
bananna
and
clove
aroma
with
some
breadiness
to
it
too
sweet
taste
with
bananna
and
clove
with
a
citrusy
finish
this
was
good
to
drink
but
a
bit
of
surprise
since
its
a
lot
more
weizen
and
not
much
bock
overall
this
was
a
surprise
not
only
for
the
deviation
from
style
color
but
the
taste
and
aromas
as
well
the
complex
blend
of
wheat
sweetness
and
maltiness
characteristic
of
a
weizenbock
but
keeping
it
light
was
exquisite
great
for
a
fall
day
in
the
midwest
d
overall
a
very
enjoyable
brew
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
flavor
complexity
of
aventinus
but
that
shouldnt
stop
anyone
from
picking
this
brew
up
and
giving
it
a
go
beer
is
medium
bodied
has
a
nice
wheaty
flavor
and
a
slight
aftertaste
that
adds
to
the
overall
feel
of
the
beer
carbonation
is
big
in
the
mouth
and
does
a
nice
job
accenting
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
drinkability
is
high
another
wonderful
beer
by
weihenstephaner
it
is
truly
great
mouthfeel
is
good
its
a
great
beer
weizenbocks
have
a
tendency
to
get
offensively
sweet
this
is
not
the
case
with
this
beer
you
can
taste
the
esters
and
there
is
some
underlying
sweetness
but
its
not
the
star
its
there
to
accent
the
wheat
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
o
unexpected
alcoholic
heat
distracts
me
too
much
from
the
nice
flavors
and
glorious
mouthfeel
even
so
as
usual
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
has
a
solid
beer
on
their
hands
this
example
still
hasnt
convinced
me
that
big
wheats
work
drinkability
was
good
little
signs
of
aby
but
has
a
great
flavor
this
is
ridiculously
drinkable
i
could
have
multiple
more
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
hard
to
believe
it
is
7
this
is
just
a
great
beer
d
outstanding
delicious
and
none
of
the
other
attributes
take
anything
away
from
it
could
have
a
few
on
a
nice
warm
summer
evening
d
the
balance
is
alttle
strange
as
many
have
said
this
tastes
like
a
hefeweizen
on
crack
i
personally
find
the
strong
banana
and
fruit
flavors
very
appealing
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
something
i
buy
regularly
its
also
pretty
affordable
drinkability
dangerous
high
alcohol
content
but
i
can
drink
these
over
and
over
again
the
price
is
right
here
in
germany
about
a
dollar
per
bottle
when
purchased
by
the
case
i
dread
how
much
ill
have
to
pay
for
this
when
i
return
home
to
the
states
pours
a
very
hazed
golden
peach
with
a
monstrous
head
of
foam
which
very
slowly
dissipates
leaving
behind
some
very
nice
lacing
lots
of
carbonation
rushing
to
the
top
and
this
continues
for
some
time
the
aroma
is
of
a
multitude
of
yeasty
esters
the
primary
ones
beingnot
surprisinglyclove
the
most
prominent
banana
and
bubblegum
the
taste
is
similar
but
there
is
a
certain
cloying
sweetness
as
well
a
bit
of
the
wheat
seems
to
be
coming
through
in
the
taste
although
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
so
its
not
coming
through
in
that
regard
drinkability
is
quite
high
especially
given
the
high
abv
which
there
is
no
trace
of
in
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
drinkability
went
very
well
with
a
meal
chicken
cacciatore
and
im
thinking
one
500ml
bottle
is
enough
for
an
evening
not
my
favorite
weizenbock
but
it
is
good
and
i
think
it
has
potential
to
work
well
with
a
lot
of
other
food
im
wondering
though
if
i
stirred
up
the
sediment
and
drank
that
too
if
my
experience
would
be
better
ive
had
germans
tell
me
this
is
the
thing
to
do
and
others
tell
me
im
nuts
to
do
it
but
i
do
notice
a
taste
difference
between
the
two
routes
so
ill
have
to
try
it
again
1204
drinkability
another
really
clean
beer
from
this
brewery
i
love
the
lightness
and
the
banana
taste
i
will
be
having
this
again
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticable
notes
this
was
my
first
weizenbock
and
im
very
pleased
i
found
it
to
be
very
similar
to
this
brewerys
hefeweizen
with
less
banana
flavor
and
a
slightly
richer
flavor
and
body
the
hefeweizen
is
great
but
this
takes
the
concept
one
step
further
with
excellent
results
cheers
i
wasnt
sure
if
weizenbocks
were
filtered
or
not
before
pouring
the
last
bit
i
admired
the
color
as
being
somewhere
between
straw
and
gold
after
a
swirl
and
a
pour
of
the
final
bit
i
happily
admired
the
curling
cloud
that
is
characteristic
of
the
falling
yeast
and
proteins
from
a
weissbier
pour
there
was
a
frothybutnotlacy
persistent
white
head
which
gave
off
a
lovely
wheat
aroma
the
taste
was
wheaty
freshtasting
and
thirstquenching
it
has
medium
carbonation
and
overall
is
very
revitalizing
maybe
it
should
be
called
vivificus
instead
of
vitus
vitus
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
super
easydrinking
which
may
or
may
not
be
the
best
but
hey
superior
drinkability
to
say
the
least
not
really
my
thing
but
trying
to
judge
it
for
what
it
is
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
what
the
germans
do
well
d
the
best
ive
ever
had
for
the
style
and
i
think
its
easy
to
say
it
comes
from
the
fact
that
vitus
is
essentially
an
imperial
hefeweizen
and
manages
to
be
really
refreshing
despite
the
alcohol
and
intense
flavor
great
example
of
the
style
though
my
own
tastes
wouldve
asked
for
less
banana
and
bubble
gum
not
my
two
favorite
things
drinkability
its
time
to
go
back
to
the
roots
of
the
style
there
are
a
few
american
versions
of
the
weizenbock
i
have
tried
that
dont
compare
to
this
at
all
truely
this
beer
is
getting
me
back
to
where
it
all
started
germany
go
grab
one
and
enjoy
md
very
dry
which
is
an
excellent
compliment
to
the
fruity
spiciness
light
with
fairly
high
carbonation
supremely
drinkable
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
an
everyday
beer
for
me
but
an
excellent
occasional
treat
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
very
thick
and
frothy
head
that
slowly
goes
away
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
up
from
the
base
of
the
glass
smells
of
wheat
fruits
and
bread
not
overpowering
but
fairly
good
smeller
taste
is
extremely
yeasty
with
some
hints
of
bananas
unique
but
good
tasting
definitely
more
of
a
weizen
than
a
bock
in
both
appearance
and
taste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
overall
pretty
solid
beer
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
would
be
interested
in
seeing
what
other
flavors
pop
out
after
a
year
or
so
of
aging
overall
i
prefer
korbinian
to
all
other
weihenstphaner
beers
but
there
is
not
a
bad
one
in
the
stable
certainly
recommended
tried
this
on
a
whim
while
waiting
for
a
new
keg
of
racer
x
to
come
on
very
happy
i
did
d
theres
no
way
a
beer
this
size
should
be
so
easy
to
drink
it
drinks
like
its
lil
brother
it
drinks
like
a
soda
the
well
hidden
alcohol
and
enjoyable
dryness
are
partly
to
blame
the
other
finger
is
pointed
at
masterful
craftsmanship
as
far
as
i
can
remember
i
havent
had
a
weizenbock
this
light
but
i
prefer
this
version
to
all
others
it
has
the
look
taste
and
aroma
that
i
love
from
a
hefeweizen
but
with
a
soft
chubby
body
and
a
real
alcohol
kick
a
case
in
the
basement
would
not
be
out
of
the
question
in
fact
its
a
damn
good
idea
dthis
goes
down
easy
considering
abv
but
its
really
not
my
kind
of
thing
this
is
my
first
weizenbock
and
im
open
to
trying
others
but
probably
not
this
one
again
d
7

abv
youd
never
know
it
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
excellent
june
10
had
it
again
and
it
was
a
house
favorite
first
time
ive
had
a
beer
that
has
a
very
definitive
lavender
taste
to
it
no
hints
about
it
great
body
great
great
esters
in
palate
and
nose
goes
down
frightfully
easy
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
and
a
great
value
personally
i
would
probably
opt
for
other
weizenbocks
or
hefeweizens
that
said
vitus
has
an
exceptionally
big
taste
the
flavor
goes
a
lot
further
than
i
was
expecting
its
less
refreshing
than
it
is
intriguing
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
insanely
smooth
alcohol
has
the
perfect
amount
of
masking
d
excellent
possibly
the
best
of
its
type
that
ive
had
this
brewery
knows
what
theyre
doing
it
can
sneak
up
on
you
though
since
the
alcohol
is
no
where
to
be
found
despite
the
7
7
an
overall
amazing
brew
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
such
a
nice
drinking
beer
with
a
great
banana
taste
if
thats
what
youre
into
in
your
weissens
im
seeing
now
why
this
brew
is
so
revered
on
this
site
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
or
six
next
time
you
see
it
moderate
carbonation
and
perfect
substance
for
the
flavor
profile
and
style
abv
is
well
hidden
this
is
truly
a
style
defining
beer
if
you
see
it
on

just
order

could
drink

while
the

are

nothing

good

well
carbonated
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
beyond
sessionable
but
you
could
have
as
many
as
you
want
and
ill
be
wanting
more
d
goes
down
so
well
and
is
such
a
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
you
dont
notice
the
alcohol
much
until
the
end
when
you
realize
your
pint
is
almost
gone
great
flavors
throughout
and
the
profile
continues
to
change
as
it
warms
really
fun
to
explore
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy

color
with
a
white
foamy

the

definitely
be

to
return
to
this
one
d
quite
different
from
other
weizenbocks
that
i
have
had
vitus
doesnt
really
have
any
of
the
dark

that
i
would
expect
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
d
excellent
drinkability
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
but
its
similar
to
a
regular

just
a
bit
more
intense

sweetness
although
not
dark
malts
with
higher
alcohol
very
good
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
darker
fruitier
maltier
etc
d
extremely
drinkable
could
definitely
imperial
session
this
sucker
at
7
7
abv
overall
because
of
the
similarity
with
its
milder
brother
i
couldnt
help
but
do
this
review
as
a
comparison
although
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
think
i
will
stick
with
the
latter
this
was
simply
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
absolutely
delicious
even
with
the
slightly
higher
abv
i
could
see
myself
easily
drinking
these
all
night
if
it
was
more
readily
available
in
the
area
d
a
very
good
beer
but
honestly
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
is
not
completely
dissimilar
from
other
weizenbocks
but
it
is
a
different
take
on
the
style
with
much
more
or
the
normal
hefeweizen
traits
being
preserved
quite
easy
to
drink
though
as
you
would
expect
weihenstephaner
do
not
dissapoint
vius
is
a
classic
weizenbock
and
stacks
up
well
with
the
greats
in
the
style
overall
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
im
regretting
i
only
purchased
one
bottle
back
to
wegmans
full
bodied
with
enough
co2
to
nearly
pass
it
off
as
a
quaffer
given
its
familar
hefeweizen
cues
its
not
so
much
a
hefe
on
steroids
as
one
thats
simply
bred
bigger
and
better
d
this
is
quite
an
interesting
beer
and
it
lends
perspective
to
the
american
wheat
wines
that
have
begun
to
appear
in
the
last
few
years
there
is
a
lot
of
intensity
to
the
yeast
flavors
here
that
seems
to
be
a
byproduct
of
the
relatively
high
gravity
the
intensity
of
the
bubblegum
and
clove
character
isnt
over
the
top
but
if
it
were
much
stronger
it
would
hurt
the
beer
there
is
a
lot
of
malt
backing
the
yeast
and
that
helps
keep
it
drinkable
the
aroma
is
excellent
but
the
flavor
of
intense
almost
harsh
yeast
is
just
not
as
well
balanced
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
but
i
still
prefer
the
lower
gravity
german
wheats
drinkability
my
first
reaction
on
the
pour
was
one
of
surprise
at
the
lightness
of
the
color
and
i
wondered
if
id
grabbed
the
wrong
bottle
this
is
very
drinkable
hefeweizenweizenbock
and
even
before
the
beer
was
half
gone
i
was
wishing
that
i
had
another
one
to
open
this
evening
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
more
of
this
one
quite
easy
to
drink
heavier
on
the
spice
than
some
but
a
nice
fruitiness
to
balance
it
out
a
sweet
streak
through
the
middle
nice
beer
the
flavors
are
kicked
up
and
pronounced
maybe
not
the
most
intricate
but
its
a
delight
to
drink
d
drinkability
is
fantastic
there
is
nothing
harsh
or
offensive
about
this
beer
whatsoever
im
sure
even
a
non
beer
drinker
could
drink
this
one
the
alcohol
content
is
well
hidden
for
its
gravity
but
certainly
there
great
beer
and
very
reccommended
pretty
high
alcohol
limits
this
beers
drinkability
along
with
the
acidity
but
still
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
in
taste
i
keep
wanting
to
take
another
sip
the
only
thing
that
would
hold
me
back
from
that
is
that
by
the
end
of
this
pintbottle
i
am
feeling
a
little
full
but
this
beer
feels
so
crisp
and
fresh
for
a
bock
strength
beer
great
stuff
maybe
its
because
i
havent
been
that
into
wheats
lately
or
my
expectations
were
put
up
a
bit
too
highdidnt
quite
match
my
expectations
yet
still
a
great
brew
extremely
wellbalance
beer
thats
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
body
a
perfect
amalgam
of
spicy
clove
sweet
citrus
fruit
corriander
and
ripe
banana
notes
the
spicy
cloves
are
pretty
prominent
up
front
followed
by
a
a
perfect
blend
of
lemon
peel
orange
peel
ripe
banana
and
subtle
hops
there
is
also
a
very
nice
slight
tartness
in
the
dry
finish
this
is
a
complex
beer
that
is
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
highly
recommended
d
excellent
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
500ml
bottle
poured
into
my
weihenstephaner
weizen
glass
vitus
appears
a
hazed
rich
straw
yellow
color
with
about
three
fingers
of
cloudlike
bone
white
foam
aromas
and
flavors
are
made
up
of
toasted
nutty
wheat
bananas
a
decent
amount
of
caramelized
malts
mild
milk
chocolate
notes
banana
bread
yeasty
citrus
notes
approaching
full
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
yet
another
world
class
offing
from
weihenstephanerer
most
definitely
an
easy
drinker
at
7
7
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
and
too
quickly
and
will
be
picking
up
more
in
the
future
basically
a
supercharged
hefeweizen
vs
a
dunkel
such
as
you
find
with
aventinus
which
offers
more
complexity
in
flavor
a
different
approach
and
rather
well
done
very
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
very
sessionable
could
be
drank
in
the
sun
or
inside
easy
to
drink
with
a
well
masked
high
abv
and
affordable
i
recommend
it
to
all
on
the
whole
another
excellent
brew
from
weihenstephaner
i
could
easily
drink
another
three
or
four
of
these
in
one
sitting
though
im
not
sure
thats
such
a
good
idea
since
it
is
stronger
than
the
hefe
will
probably
have
to
do
a
parallel
taste
test
in
the
future
with
the
hefe
just
for
comparisons
sake
and
with
how
tasty
both
of
these
beers
are
i
think
thatll
have
to
be
pretty
soon
drinkability
might
be
hampered
by
the
fact
that
you
will
want
to
smell
this
beer
for
hours
but
between
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
youll
have
no
problem
making
1
3
or
even
5
of
these
disapear
before
you
can
say
v
i
t
u
s
epic
drinkability
quite
enjoyable
weihenstephaners
clearly
been
doing
this
a
while
drinkability
this
one
certainly
hides
the
abv
well
i
honestly
think
that
if
someone
were
to
present
this
to
me
as
a
standard
hefeweizen
i
wouldnt
know
the
difference
i
cant
recommend
it
but
i
know
that
it
is
different
enough
to
seek
out
to
try
something
very
different
drank
very
similarly
to
their
hefeweissbier
a
pale
golden
color
in
the
glass
with
a
voluminous
white
head
that
evolved
into
a
nice
thin
head
that
clung
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
and
flavor
was
very
similar
to
a
tradition
hefe
with
perhaps
a
more
pronounced
citrus
quality
and
a
drier
finish
its
full
bodied
yet
light
on
the
tongue
due
to
its
high
carbonation
i
found
it
highly
drinkable
in
spite
of
its
higher
abv
which
was
really
well
managed
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
it
was
a
lot
more
complex
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
and
was
so
drinkable
i
want
to
buy
more
of
this
but
it
isnt
available
in
mn
definitely
a
great
beer
aroma
is
of
banana
phenols
and
clove
extremely
sugary
vitus
tastes
like
a
banana
lemon
creamsicle
with
raisiny
cloves
and
toffee
whereas
i
would
equate
most
weizenbocks
with
fall
this
one
has
more
of
a
lighter
summer
flair
poured
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
that
retained
pretty
well
and
left
a
little
lacing
the
smell
was
of
bananas
and
cloves
like
a
hefeweizen
but
stronger
taste
was
again
like
a
strong
hefeweizen
some
spice
and
a
lot
of
banana
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
with
mild
carbonation
all
in
all
very
delicious
and
extremely
drinkable
for
7
7
abv
d
wonderfully
drinkable
smooth
good
flavor
with
a
good
mouthfeel
this
is
now
become
my
favorite
weissbeer
overall
great
flavors
very
smooth
beer
highly
drinkable
similar
to
hefeweissbier
wouldnt
be
able
to
guess
the
nearly
8
abv
overalla
must
have
would
make
for
an
excellent
fall
beer
or
in
my
case
a
night
beer
for
the
middle
of
august
im
glad
i
got
this
all
the
brews
from
this
brewery
are
awesome
try
this
one
when
you
want
a
big
hefe
conclusion
this
is
a
damn
good
specialty
beer
and
was
definitely
a
nice
surprise
will
try
this
again
for
sure
quite
nice
a
classic
a
delicious
beer
probably
good
for
two
in
a
row
no
more
than
three
d
nice
stuff
pale
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
haze
quite
the
bevy
of
foam
and
lacing
moderate
aromamildly
spicey
and
somewhat
cloveish
very
crisp
and
clean
flavor
wise
a
wheaty
crispness
against
and
slightly
spiced
and
phenolic
bite
somewhat
peppery
tinge
solid
mouthfeel
really
a
great
beer
all
around
i
could
do
this
again
and
again
overall
a
very
solid
weizenbock
recommended
this
poured
a
hazy
straw
color
with
lots
of
white
head
it
smelled
like
lemon
and
sour
yeast
with
some
caramel
malt
and
banana
and
light
cloves
it
tasted
like
lemon
and
banana
and
wheat
bread
and
sour
yeast
with
caramel
and
cloves
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
mild
carbonation
and
had
a
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
was
very
enjoyable
i
liked
it
better
than
the
standard
hefeweissbier
by
weihenstephan
since
it
had
a
bit
more
spice
and
complexity
to
it
but
despite
its
complexity
it
was
still
super
drinkable
with
great
body
and
brilliantly
hidden
alcohol
quite
refreshing
and
perfect
on
a
summer
night
mouthfeel
is
deliciously
sticky
with
a
lot
of
foam
from
the
haze
adding
texture
to
the
palate
this
is
another
excellent
although
very
different
weizenbock
rich
challenging
flavours
with
an
excellent
balance
achieved
through
basically
a
lot
of
everything
lots
of
malt
and
funkay
yeast
with
some
nice
german
hopping
definitely
an
interesting
drop
keeps
you
focused
from
start
to
finish
i
really
dig
weizenbocks
and
this
beer
just
might
be
one
of
the
best
ones
ive
had
yet
the
7
7
abv
is
so
well
hidden
its
not
even
funny
complex
flavors
with
a
medium
body
mouthfeel
and
drinkable
especially
on
this
warm
summer
afternoon
this
is
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
a
hearty
weizen
with
some
kick
alcohol
not
even
noticeable
beer
is
particularly
soft
and
smooth
on
the
back
end
with
that
banana
taste
again
mmmm
yum
d
refreshingeasy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
i
did
drink
2
500ml
easy
before
i
reviewed
its
everything
youd
expect
to
enjoy
from
going
to
a
local
german
beer
garden
on
a
hot
sunday
afternoon
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
color
and
is
opaque
with
a
1
finger
head
that
dissipates
within
a
minute
leaves
no
lacing
behind
whatsoever
smells
good
fruity
spicy
lemon
very
much
like
the
weeihen
heffeweiss
tastes
just
like
the
heffeweis
but
maybe
a
bit
more
citrusfruity
somehow
more
alcohol
that
is
very
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
very
smooth
with
good
carbonation
goes
down
well
very
tasty
and
smooth
makes
for
great
drinkability
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
one
session
good
stuff
wheat
beers
are
not
necessarily
my
favorite
style
but
this
weizenbock
really
stands
out
a
real
treat
this
brewery
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
moderate
to
light
feel
a
little
grainy
but
still
smooth
very
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
i
felt
that
the
beer
was
just
like
the
hefe
only
filtered
md
decent
carbonation
and
flavor
sort
of
a
refreshing
brew
but
there
is
a
soapiness
to
it
that
turns
me
off
to
this
one
i
dont
think
ill
get
it
again
notes
this
is
liquid
goodness
alcohol
could
really
sneak
up
on
the
drinker
here
since
it
is
so
well
hidden
this
is
the
5th
and
final
weihenstephaner
beer
that
i
sampled
recently
this
one
did
not
dissapoint
had
this
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
nice
to
taste
the
tap
version
versus
the
bottle
the
tap
version
just
screams
banana
while
the
bottle
is
a
bit
more
subtle
and
complex
i
like
both
but
this
is
definitely
a
bit
less
integrated
than
the
bottled
version
pours
a
hazy
pale
golden
with
a
big
head
smells
a
bit
grainy
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
lots
of
banana
tastes
of
lots
of
sweet
banana
some
more
vanilla
and
soft
wheat
all
followed
by
some
refreshing
lemon
notes
that
cut
through
the
rest
og
the
flavors
thre
is
a
slight
bitterness
followed
by
a
sweeter
finish
near
the
end
pretty
nice
overall
as
before
mentioned
vitus
is
much
like
a
stronger
version
of
hefe
only
with
reduced
drinkability
being
so
similar
to
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
can
only
be
a
good
thing
a
great
beer
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
weizenbocks
its
less
complex
then
some
especially
aventinus
which
makes
this
a
very
sneaky
brew
it
basically
is
a
weihenstephaner
hefeweizen
on
roids
and
hides
its
strength
very
well
d
the
7
7
abv
is
well
hidden
in
this
one
i
consider
this
to
be
very
drinkable
can
be
enjoyed
with
sipping
and
with
sloshing
i
recommend
savoring
it
though
d
highly
drinkable
with
good
flavor
and
low
alcohol
taste
big
frothy
white
head
with
a
hazy
yellow
color
clovewheat
aroma
essentially
smells
like
a
hefeweizen
taste
is
sweet
and
wheaty
a
little
bit
of
clove
and
some
taste
of
bubblegum
it
hides
the
high
abv
quite
well
there
is
only
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
a
fantastic
beer
something
id
really
enjoy
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
is
an
interesting
beer
only
weizenbock
ive
had
that
is
not
ruby
red
it
looks
like
one
of
those
oktoberfests
that
are
pale
acts
like
one
too
nice
head
not
much
lacing
very
strong
but
not
detectable
very
strong
wheaty
and
plumby
on
the
nose
not
the
typical
weizenbock
but
special
in
its
ownright
very
fruity
like
a
belgian
reminds
me
of
delirium
tremens
very
good
beer
d
good
but
closer
to
a
maibock
than
a
weizenbock
too
light
and
not
enough
dark
fruit
mouthfeel
was
zesty
but
ends
smoothly
body
was
medium
to
full
d
im
not
much
of
a
wheat
beer
kinda
guy
but
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
be
pretty
damn
happy
with
it
this
is
a
fine
beer
highly
recommended
fantastic
weizenbock
and
now
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
drinkability
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
beer
till
the
raccoons
sleep
and
after
served
in
a
beautiful
vitus
chalice
at
the
brick
store
pub
cloudy
yellow
peach
with
a
thick
frothy
fizzy
white
head
subtle
aromas
of
green
apple
banana
and
clove
zesty
fizzy
up
front
with
noticeable
flavors
of
lemon
clove
banana
this
gets
banana
bready
in
the
middle
finishing
dry
very
subtle
and
easy
to
drink
tastes
like
a
better
than
average
hefeweizen
even
though
its
labeled
a
weizenbock
d
an
enjoyable
beer
that
drinks
very
nicely
for
the
abv
i
cant
say
it
is
extraordinarily
memorable
but
it
is
tasty
and
smooth
pours
a
very
light
straw
goldenrod
color
with
a
great
1
5
inch
head
that
sticks
around
and
laces
smells
like
bread
yeast
banana
spices
and
european
hops
taste
is
spicy
and
light
bready
and
hints
of
german
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
which
contributes
to
the
drinkability
d
sweet
mother
i
wish
i
had
another
several
of
these
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
easiestdrinking
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
i
had
to
do
a
double
take
when
i
saw
that
the
abv
is
7
7
as
this
goes
down
so
ridiculously
easily
i
thought
it
couldnt
be
much
more
than
5
was
very
excited
to
try
this
with
all
the
hype
but
unfortunately
it
just
wasnt
my
style
glad
i
tried
it
still
a
great
beer
and
highly
recommended
very
cloudy
golden
yellow
huge
head
tons
of
lacing
strange
color
for
a
weizenbock
generally
dark
coloredbut
whatever
smell
is
yeasty
and
grassy
makes
me
want
to
visit
a
farm
taste
is
grassy
with
banana
and
cloves
mouthfeel
is
a
slightly
chewey
but
very
well
carbonated
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
overall
damn
tasty
refreshing
like
a
hefe
but
carries
an
extra
punch
with
it
wow
grainy
and
malty
with
huge
bubblegum
and
clove
flavors
this
might
be
the
most
refreshing
and
lightfeeling
7
7
beer
i
have
had
goes
down
very
smooth
and
easy
somewhat
unweizenbock
but
nonetheless
a
damn
tasty
beer
i
can
always
make
room
in
my
fridge
for
a
few
of
these
fairly
good
price
at
less
than
3
a
pop
the
richness
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
make
vitus
fairly
easy
to
drink
though
after
a
little
more
than
half
of
the
1
pint
bottle
im
feeling
the
abv
nevertheless
my
experience
makes
me
eager
to
try
more
of
it
and
other
weizenbocks
picked
up
a
bottle
for
3
25
poured
into
a
weihenstephaner
hefe
glass
bright
yellow
color
and
a
very
cloudy
body
huge
fluffy
ivory
white
head
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
was
a
huge
burst
of
clove
taste
was
pretty
close
to
perfect
intense
flavor
of
banana
and
bubble
gum
at
a
nice
chilled
temp
this
beer
has
a
wonderfully
smooth
body
to
it
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
noticeable
so
i
found
myself
drinking
it
a
bit
slower
than
i
expected
but
taste
urged
me
to
drink
more
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
a
bunch
of
in
one
evening
but
enjoying
one
was
quite
a
treat
if
i
could
find
this
locally
id
likely
drink
a
fair
bit
of
it
might
be
a
little
too
sweet
to
do
in
a
row
drinkability
very
refreshing
although
lacking
in
lasting
flavor
would
but
this
beer
again
just
like
their
hefe
this
one
begs
you
to
drink
more
with
every
sip
the
only
big
drawback
is
that
the
carbonation
is
deceptive
in
that
it
fills
you
up
without
being
heavy
on
the
tongue
another
winner
from
weihenstephan
d
very
easy
drinking
beer
considering
the
alcohol
content
and
the
overall
hugeness
of
this
beer
it
goes
down
very
easily
a
little
lighter
in
color
than
i
had
expected
but
still
a
nice
beer
very
interesting
hmm
im
torn
about
whether
this
is
better
than
the
regular
weihenstephaner
weissbier
i
suppose
the
intensity
of
the
flavors
and
higher
abv
cut
down
drinkability
bah
what
am
i
saying
i
could
still
drink
this
all
day
thank
you
reverend
coloradobobs
for
prasing
this
brew
i
finally
tried
it
poured
into
a
pils
glass
head
was
quite
nice
and
stayed
even
after
sitting
awhile
picked
up
a
very
nice
citrusy
smell
and
after
two
sips
was
able
to
pick
up
banana
and
clove
the
alcohol
is
quite
disguised
i
could
get
into
major
trouble
with
this
one
as
you
dont
realize
its
as
potent
as
it
is
if
not
for
the
alcohol
content
id
call
this
a
sessionable
brew
i
could
still
find
myself
quaffing
two
or
three
in
a
sitting
at
home
though
great
brew
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
slight
orange
glow
it
poured
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
it
has
strong
aroma
of
banana
and
cloves
which
i
expected
along
with
some
yeast
it
has
a
spicy
flavor
which
i
very
much
enjoy
some
flavors
i
picked
up
on
were
banana
a
slight
mango
clove
and
i
think
im
getting
some
ginger
in
there
as
well
its
a
light
bodied
effervescent
beer
overall
its
extremely
approachable
for
its
higher
alcohol
prototypical
weizen
appearance
the
pale
body
the
large
head
and
cloudy
consistency
were
unmistakable
the
aroma
was
also
classic
banana
and
clove
and
was
pretty
inviting
the
taste
was
a
lot
spicier
than
the
hefeweizen
this
looked
like
the
clove
notes
were
much
more
pronounced
and
there
was
also
some
sourness
apparent
very
light
in
the
mouth
which
is
quite
typical
of
wheat
based
beers
but
it
was
quite
a
bit
lighter
than
anticipated
considering
this
is
a
weizenbock
probably
the
easiest
to
drink
near
8
beer
ive
sampled
way
different
than
aventinus
or
any
other
examples
of
this
style
weihenstephaner
does
it
again
with
their
weizenbock
ive
been
impressed
with
every
weihenstephaner
beer
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
hefe
dunkel
korbinian
and
now
the
vitus
and
im
beginning
to
think
that
this
brewery
cannot
put
a
foot
wrong
superb
flavor
and
quite
drinkable
i
would
definitely
recommend
you
get
your
hands
on
a
bottle
of
vitus
too
sweet
to
drink
too
much
of
and
too
heavy
to
drink
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
is
it
this
beer
i
think
is
a
fine
example
of
just
plain
great
craftsmanship
and
what
you
choose
to
or
choose
not
to
match
it
with
is
up
to
you
i
still
have
half
a
bottle
and
im
definitely
going
to
enjoy
it
as
is
overall
this
one
tasty
beverage
and
another
solid
brew
by
weihenstephaner
d
no
surprise
to
me
that
weihenstephaner
makes
a
very
good
drinkable
weizenbock
good
when
you
want
something
like
a
hefe
but
a
little
stronger
falls
somewhere
between
hefeweizen
and
wheatwine
theres
a
saying
around
the
parts
where
this
beer
is
brewed
perfect
sound
sweet
pure
barley
and
wheat
if
that
isnt
a
deadringer
for
the
weihenstephaner
vitus
i
dont
know
what
is
ive
loved
every
one
of
this
brewerys
beers
even
trying
them
all
on
this
side
of
the
pond
if
weihenstephaner
is
really
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
then
weve
kept
the
right
one
around
drinkability
is
really
quite
impressive
for
the
style
at
7
7
you
wont
want
to
slam
them
down
too
fast
but
it
wouldnt
be
too
hard
i
hear
people
talking
about
this
one
all
the
time
and
now
it
all
makes
sense
all
in
all
very
good
and
enjoyable
worth
seeking
out
a
great
weizenbock
another
brew
i
am
sure
i
will
be
seeing
again
this
summer
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
the
almost
8
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
d
the
7
7
abv
pushes
it
but
im
there
this
should
be
a
staple
beer
in
the
fridge
year
round
bravo
vitus
will
not
be
denied
great
flavor
profile
with
a
slick
initial
presence
of
wheat
and
caramel
followed
by
zesty
yeast
and
hops
that
drop
notes
of
white
pepper
clove
and
boozy
bubblegum
finishes
with
a
smooth
yet
wellcarbonated
burst
of
alcohol
and
fruity
yeastiness
body
on
the
thicker
side
of
medium
i
suppose
its
not
surprising
how
much
i
enjoyed
vitus
after
all
it
is
a
classic
d
the
spiceyness
and
alcohol
make
this
the
only
one
id
want
to
drink
in
a
setting
not
saying
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
ever
just
not
twice
in
a
night
read
about
this
one
in
the
latest
ba
magazine
and
i
came
away
impressed
it
is
a
great
beer
at
a
great
price
point
2
99
i
gotta
say
that
this
was
a
spectacular
beer
and
went
down
really
well
for
having
a
7
70
abv
and
has
high
drinkability
potential
poured
it
into
my
duvel
glass
hazy
orange
color
with
about
one
inch
thick
head
got
lots
of
clove
and
some
banana
in
the
aroma
again
more
cloves
in
the
taste
banana
and
some
pineapple
extremely
smooth
to
drink
with
the
right
amount
of
maltiness
i
love
this
beer
highly
recommended
t
the
flavor
is
of
hops
wheat
and
yeast
very
typical
of
a
good
bock
beer
it
was
fabulous
for
its
style
lighter
in
flavor
and
color
than
what
i
expected
not
dark
malts
here
just
slightly
bigger
body
kinda
like
if
you
were
to
upgrade
from
a
domestic
macroswill
to
an
ice
beer
with
the
letters
xxx
on
it
this
is
what
you
would
get
in
the
world
of
hefes
i
expected
more
dark
malts
and
complexity
but
for
what
it
is
its
a
decent
hefe
m
and
d
mediumbodied
and
incredibly
slick
a
good
dose
of
carbonation
brings
out
the
bold
spices
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
hides
so
well
that
i
got
a
nice
warming
sensation
afterwards
that
hit
me
right
after
the
last
sip
ive
already
recommended
this
to
folks
in
town
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
this
beer
again
very
soon
big
thanks
to
coloradobobs
for
hyping
this
every
night
on
lnba
and
to
vintage
estate
for
carrying
it
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
the
next
time
i
am
out
there
the
beer
had
a
definitive
resemblence
to
maibocks
in
the
malt
profile
but
with
the
beautiful
balance
and
complexity
of
traditional
wheat
beers
is
this
a
marriage
made
in
a
brewery
you
thought
i
was
going
to
say
heaven
didnt
you
why
arent
more
breweries
doing
this
note
the
beer
darkens
as
the
subsequent
pours
are
taken
from
the
bottle
but
the
beer
never
takes
on
hazy
proportions
maybe
kristalweizenlike
filtered
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
refreshing
but
it
packs
quite
a
wallop
at
7
7
percent
abv
picked
up
a
couple
bottles
of
this
at
greens
along
buford
highway
took
a
bottle
over
to
my
dads
to
celebrate
his
birthday
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
spicy
citrusy
clove
and
banana
in
the
nose
tastes
citrusy
earthy
and
spicy
very
carbonated
mouthfeel
overall
a
good
beer
glad
this
is
readily
available
now
overall
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
all
night
till
the
cows
come
home
so
many
flavors
to
think
about
and
experience
the
aroma
is
absolutely
amazing
this
beer
is
an
amazing
experience
yet
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
amazingly
drinkable
for
the
abv
almost
no
alcohol
detectable
at
all
you
could
drink
this
on
a
cold
night
or
in
the
summer
heat
this
is
an
all
season
beer
overall
mouthfeel
was
good
well
carbonated
and
mediumlight
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
beer
i
really
enjoyed
and
need
to
try
more
of
the
style
drinkability
was
smooth
and
easy
drinking
and
it
went
down
way
too
well
for
7
7
i
enjoyed
it
alot
although
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
due
to
the
overwhelming
citrus
tastes
this
is
a
home
run
for
sure
everyone
should
subscribe
to
the
gospel
according
to
coloradobobs
and
drink
one
of
these
now
d
sweet
mother
of
zeus
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
d
the
beer
disappeared
quickly
for
me
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
however
if
you
are
not
a
big
fan
of
spice
character
in
beer
this
may
not
be
the
one
for
you
luckily
i
love
it
when
it
is
done
right
like
this
one
is
medium
bodied
and
fairly
chewy
good
carbonation
and
overall
a
pleasant
beer
very
drinkable
easily
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
one
drinkability
this
comes
across
as
more
weizeny
than
bocky
the
malts
are
a
little
too
lost
in
the
yeast
and
spices
but
those
flavors
are
so
tasty
i
dont
mind
the
alcohol
is
wellmasked
and
for
this
style
thats
impressive
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
in
the
upcoming
months
at
a
barbecue
or
two
i
can
see
why
d
kind
of
like
a
regular
hefe
turned
up
to
11
the
extra
body
lets
you
know
this
is
a
strong
beer
yet
it
drinks
lighter
than
it
is
i
wished
the
banana
factor
was
a
bit
higher
but
otherwise
this
is
very
nice
remarkable
beer
that
really
has
no
equal
that
i
have
had
it
would
pair
nicely
with
any
number
of
foods
from
salad
to
dessert
weihenstephan
is
the
bomb
tmd
very
smooth
and
balanced
with
a
hint
of
a
hoppy
bite
that
really
makes
this
one
interesting
the
alcohol
hides
pretty
well
but
i
can
tell
its
there
from
the
warming
feeling
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
overall
a
big
winner
nice
and
drinkable
even
at
7
7
try
this
pours
a
cloudyishclearish
yellow
colored
body
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
has
a
flowery
clover
smelling
aroma
some
banana
in
the
nose
too
taste
is
banana
flowery
fruity
maybe
some
citrus
wow
refreshing
and
light
gooood
but
like
most
german
beers
this
one
is
probably
fresh
delicious
stuff
sweet
finish
excellent
beer
this
brewery
does
no
wrong
had
their
dark
weiss
on
tap
last
week
sorry
bobs
as
much
as
this
is
a
good
beer
the
dark
weiss
beats
its
ass
like
a
bongo
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
but
not
overbearing
thouroughly
enjoyable
for
me
i
would
put
st
vitus
up
next
to
aventinus
any
day
weihenstephaner
always
seems
to
produce
the
highest
level
of
quality
layers
of
banana
vanilla
clove
and
spice
that
has
a
complexity
and
mouth
feel
that
is
uncommon
for
the
style
intensely
sweet
but
strongly
balanced
and
flavored
nose
showcases
typical
weisse
notes
light
golden
colored
with
a
filmy
white
head
stunning
wheat
ale
this
is
a
great
beer
light
lemon
yellow
pour
with
a
billowing
head
huge
banana
nose
with
notes
of
yeast
and
brown
bread
and
biscuit
very
very
nice
taste
is
similar
with
banana
and
a
lot
of
breadiness
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
on
the
back
end
more
cinnamon
than
black
pepper
finish
is
a
touch
watery
but
that
is
my
only
knock
on
this
beer
perhaps
i
am
not
terribly
familiar
with
the
style
and
thus
lack
a
baseline
for
review
regardless
this
beer
is
fantastic
and
i
am
absolutely
loving
it
for
me
more
impressive
than
the
highly
rated
hefeweissbeer
pick
this
up
its
fantastic
a
fine
beer
halfliter
bottle
with
some
code
on
the
back
label
17
ibus
the
beer
is
a
pale
yellowedgold
with
lots
of
carbonation
that
builds
up
three
fingers
of
bright
white
head
vibrant
and
enticing
the
aroma
starts
grassy
with
wheat
and
banana
close
behind
and
a
gentle
fruityspicy
component
to
round
things
out
similar
flavor
with
yeast
a
touch
of
banana
clove
spiciness
light
bitterness
and
some
warming
alcohol
the
flavor
really
opens
up
as
it
warms
and
the
sweetness
increases
with
the
temperature
light
and
crisp
at
the
beginning
medium
and
incredibly
smooth
by
the
end
with
a
lingering
spice
this
is
not
necessarily
a
complex
beer
but
it
is
so
damn
tasty
and
pretty
cheap
to
boot
a
classic
in
the
world
of
weizenbocks
since
this
was
a
bomber
i
gassed
and
capped
the
rest
i
guess
one
glass
at
a
time
is
enough
for
me
this
is
the
only
weihenstephaner
i
would
have
to
think
twice
about
buying
again
d
high
drinkability
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
satisfies
and
entices
me
for
another
drink
this
beer
pours
a
light
and
cloudy
amber
with
a
large
head
and
tons
of
lacing
the
smell
is
of
bananas
and
malt
the
flavor
has
a
very
nice
malt
base
to
it
with
a
nice
and
smooth
banana
flavor
coming
from
the
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
creamy
with
a
nice
carbonation
level
incredibly
drinkable
brew
i
will
purchase
this
again
overall
this
is
good
the
abv
is
too
high
to
make
it
a
session
beer
but
its
very
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable
as
well
this
is
like
their
regular
hefeweizen
on
steroids
a
pleasure
through
and
through
one
ill
definitely
pick
up
again
when
i
see
it
i
might
even
age
a
few
to
see
if
the
alcohol
mellows
and
it
smoothens
out
over
time
that
would
just
make
it
killer
drinkable
and
send
it
over
the
top
this
is
amazingly
drinkable
this
bottle
was
like
2
99
are
you
kidding
me
what
a
steal
i
think
this
jumps
lion
stout
as
my
best
beer
bargain
phenomenal
beer
solid
drinkable
brew
more
like
a
hefe
500ml
brown
bottle
served
in
a
hefe
glass
poured
a
hazy
pale
gold
lots
of
carbonation
typical
for
a
wheat
beer
thick
white
head
plenty
of
clove
in
the
aroma
more
than
banana
this
is
the
way
i
prefer
it
medium
to
light
bodied
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
spicy
flavor
from
both
the
yeast
and
the
wheat
also
some
fruitiness
lingering
clove
flavor
in
the
finish
you
can
taste
that
there
is
strength
there
but
it
is
not
hot
plenty
of
malt
this
is
a
classic
weizenbock
drinkability
is
high
this
beer
is
well
crafted
and
brings
good
flavor
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
its
simple
light
and
refreshing
well
done
love
it
cant
imagine
it
could
be
done
better
d
this
is
extremely
drinkable
not
as
good
as
the
hefe
but
very
close
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
bombers
of
these
and
at
7
alcohol
i
would
be
a
mess
easily
sessionable
doesnt
feel
or
drink
anything
like
as
big
as
it
is
every
time
i
try
a
beer
from
this
brewery
i
become
a
bigger
fan
tmd
wow
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
first
hits
of
caramel
malt
followed
by
bright
fruit
and
spice
notes
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
with
light
prickes
from
the
carbonation
lingering
finish
continues
the
malty
palate
attack
good
stuff
d
yum
more
a
sweeter
hefe
makes
it
a
bit
more
satisfying
and
meal
like
good
stuff
ill
get
more
while
its
fresh
this
stuff
drinks
a
hefe
hits
like
an
imperial
hefe
you
cloud
fool
your
friends
until
they
realize
theyre
legless
tm
mouth
is
heavier
than
i
thought
it
would
be
and
not
as
much
carbonation
as
expected
creamier
mouthfeel
flavors
are
along
with
the
nose
of
banana
and
clove
with
a
nice
candied
sweetness
throughout
this
fades
to
a
crsip
bite
highly
drinable
and
and
clean
taste
has
a
strong
banana
and
a
little
bite
of
carbonation
on
the
end
there
is
a
warming
alcohol
towards
the
back
of
the
drink
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
creamy
drinkability
is
very
high
this
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
booziness
that
other
weizenbocks
have
this
is
the
wheat
beer
of
the
gods
with
an
incredibly
solid
lineup
of
beers
weinhenstephan
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
vitus
just
hammers
the
point
home
i
only
have
four
different
weizenbocks
under
my
belt
thus
far
so
i
speak
more
from
enthusiasm
for
a
particular
beer
than
appreciation
of
a
wellexecuted
style
i
guess
thats
my
disclaimer
at
any
rate
vitus
is
a
thick
hazy
light
to
medium
golden
liquid
with
a
silky
head
of
tiny
bubbles
the
nose
is
sweet
with
the
spiced
wheat
banana
flavor
of
good
german
wheat
beer
the
flavor
is
all
wonderful
wheat
there
are
notes
of
banana
clove
bubblegum
and
some
other
hard
to
place
fruits
and
spices
its
quite
sweet
the
relatively
high
abv
is
wellhidden
from
both
tongue
and
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
luxuriously
velvety
the
finish
is
a
bit
tart
and
sweet
like
a
candied
lemon
rind
vitus
goes
down
exceptionally
smoothly
particularly
for
the
strength
im
going
through
this
half
liter
much
too
quickly
vitus
is
a
rich
luxurious
and
complex
doppelbock
d
high
abv
keeps
this
from
being
a
sessionable
beer
but
it
is
well
hidden
the
taste
is
also
quite
good
there
is
a
decent
efforvescence
that
spritzes
and
fizzes
a
bit
on
the
tongue
and
keeps
the
gulps
on
the
smaller
side
it
is
slightly
creamy
and
not
overly
tart
there
are
plenty
of
lemon
citrus
orange
rind
and
clove
flavors
to
keep
this
interesting
and
quite
sweet
this
is
a
bit
stronger
in
abv
than
your
garden
variety
hefe
it
is
still
fairly
light
bodied
but
there
is
an
acerbic
twinge
towards
the
finish
that
is
not
entirely
from
spice
or
hop
but
also
from
some
abv
there
is
a
slight
white
pepper
bite
to
the
beer
as
well
this
is
a
treat
for
what
it
is
more
a
summer
type
beer
quite
light
and
refreshing
lchaim
fairly
thick
fullbodied
and
bready
solid
carbonation
keeps
things
moving
right
along
very
drinkable
with
an
abv
that
contributes
to
taste
but
is
nonetheless
well
and
dangerously
hidden
how
this
ramstein
winter
wheat
are
in
the
same
category
i
have
no
idea
this
is
actually
pretty
similar
to
their
double
platinumramstein
but
minus
the
big
fruity
flavors
gorgeous
color
an
easy
substitute
in
the
off
season
i
guess
i
guess
d
quite
drinkable
definitely
does
not
taste
like
7
7
definitely
the
best
in
the
style
ive
had
but
i
prefer
the
weihenstephaner
dunkel
original
or
hef
vitus
is
excellent
beer
ive
got
a
small
gripe
with
labeling
it
a
weizenbock
but
theres
absolutely
no
denying
its
quality
im
hoping
we
see
this
beer
soon
here
in
ohio
ive
heard
it
turns
up
until
i
find
id
like
thank
josh
once
again
for
the
opportunity
i
really
enjoyed
this
its
something
i
could
drink
quite
abit
of
if
i
liked
it
more
guess
its
just
not
really
for
me
mouth
is
typical
for
the
style
slightly
overcarbonated
drinks
easy
but
would
be
better
paired
for
a
hot
day
ok
drinkability
the
alcohol
content
holds
this
category
back
for
me
very
nice
beer
but
unlike
any
of
weihenstephaners
other
beers
this
one
feels
kind
of
big
two
would
be
a
tough
prospect
for
me
picked
up
a
5l
at
abes
for
3
25
pours
a
hazy
amberorange
with
a
short
white
head
i
get
a
big
hit
of
banana
bread
as
it
warms
earthy
hops
and
orange
this
beer
actually
reminds
me
of
a
snappier
version
of
franziskaner
without
all
the
creamy
background
malt
the
aftertaste
is
a
nice
pairing
of
spice
and
citrus
hops
very
nice
its
a
touch
sweeter
than
a
normal
hefe
from
the
extra
malt
and
strength
and
its
really
the
maibock
of
german
wheat
beers
for
that
little
extra
fruit
tang
that
comes
with
the
strength
still
for
a
nearly
8
beer
its
deceptively
drinkable
this
beer
could
get
you
in
trouble
drinkability
recommended
an
expertly
crafted
expression
of
wheat
its
tasty
and
really
grows
on
you
more
and
more
with
every
sip
maybe
that
ugadawgguy
is
onto
something
easily
drinkable
despite
its
relatively
high
abv
this
is
an
excellent
beer
mfd
the
beer
has
a
great
refreshing
crisp
taste
from
the
carbonation
while
the
body
is
not
too
heavy
making
me
want
to
keep
drinking
the
only
thing
that
hold
it
back
is
i
find
the
bubbles
to
be
a
bit
much
and
they
stifle
my
drinking
making
me
feel
quite
bloated
untill
i
belch
and
continue
the
process
but
who
really
cares
its
beer
and
im
a
guy
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
of
coloradobobs
an
outstanding
weizenbock
and
very
much
an
excellent
compare
and
contrast
in
its
approach
to
aventinus
nice
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
healthy
head
smells
of
banana
and
hefeweizen
the
flavor
is
nice
cloves
citrus
lemony
very
interesting
i
dont
know
much
about
german
beers
or
weizenbocks
but
this
was
quite
good
and
id
like
another
bottle
to
investigate
further
cloudy
strawwheat
yellow
with
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
it
had
a
big
fluffy
offwhite
cap
and
there
was
some
chunky
lacing
lots
of
fruity
banana
and
clove
spice
in
the
aroma
bready
lemon
zest
light
alcohol
bubblegum
very
much
like
a
hefeweizen
in
character
flavour
was
more
of
the
same
but
a
little
richer
in
malt
having
some
caramel
character
also
a
bit
of
alcohol
flavour
and
warmth
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
nice
texture
quite
enjoyable
poured
a
16
9oz
bottle
into
my
brother
thelonious
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
light
hazy
golden
with
a
fluffy
2
inch
white
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
the
head
also
doesnt
stick
around
like
most
hefes
the
lack
of
head
retention
in
it
really
surprised
me
the
aroma
is
a
banana
smack
to
the
face
huge
clove
coriander
and
for
the
very
first
time
i
definitely
get
big
bubble
gum
notes
the
flavor
reminds
me
a
lot
of
fresh
made
banana
bread
big
banana
clove
walnuts
and
coriander
and
surprisingly
once
again
bubble
gum
this
is
really
the
first
time
i
have
ever
gotten
any
type
of
bubble
gum
out
of
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
medium
bodied
hefe
this
is
a
just
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
this
would
be
perfect
for
a
cool
summer
night
a
beautiful
beer
though
i
wish
i
had
found
it
in
the
summer
i
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
even
more
very
drinkable
and
well
made
gosh
there
is
so
much
this
beer
does
right
i
want
more
this
is
drinkable
and
delightful
bless
you
weihenstephan
dont
change
a
thing
overall
this
is
certainly
worth
a
shot
by
all
who
love
weihenstephaner
and
thanks
again
for
shrlsu
for
sending
this
along
pours
a
cloudy

a
long
lasting
head
and
decent
lacing
very
inviting

with

taste
is
surprising
rich

complexity
slightly
fruity
grassy
pleasant
alcohol
presence
mouthfeel
is
rich
creamy
blending
into
a
dry

drinkability
is

unexpectedly
light
and
relatively
clear

an
insanely
massive
pillowy
white
head
great
retention
smell
a
bit
sparse
soft
banana
and
wheat
scents
slightly
spicy
and
yeasty
but
dominated
by
a
sweet
breadyness
taste
tangy
wheat
yeast
banana
are
most
prevalent
sweet
kind
of
a
banana
pudding
thing
going
on
here
in
a
good
way

buried
in
there
lemon
dried
pineapple

slight

so
slight
warning
of
the
abv
soft
and
creamy
a
sessionable
weizenbock
uh
oh
d
this
is
probably
my
new
favorite
brew
this
is
stupid
good
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
german
styles
and
this
is
amazing
damn
near
perfect
in
every
category
this
beer
is
damn
tasty
and
goes
down
amazingly
well
and
easily
i
just
want
to
drink
more
and
i
sad
that
i
have
ran
through
this
one
so
fast
without
a
backup
for
now
she
will
be
the
one
that
got
away
but
at
least
i
was
able
to
taste
every
part
of
her
before
she
left
i
long
for
you
vitus
vitus
only
problem
i
had
was
it
was
a
little
too
sweet
kind
of
got
a
cotton
candysugar
taste
after
a
while
to
the
point
i
craved
an
ipa
or
something
sour
to
wash
this
beer
down
with
at
first
i
wanted
to
mark
this
beer
down
for
it
in
the
taste
category
but
everything
that
came
before
it
was
too
good
pours
a
cloudy
golden
straw
color
with
a
big
pillowy
white
head
that
falls
to
a
nice
cap
smell
is
full
of
big
sweet
banana
notes
sweetness
all
over
this
puppy
banana
definitely
dominates
but
i
can
get
some
powdered
sugar
angel
food
cake
etc
tastes
awesome
the
banana
pairs
with
vanilla
notes
slight
wheat
sourness
and
spice
as
unappealing
as
this
will
sound
to
some
reminds
me
of
a
banana
smoothie
or
pudding
the
mouthfeel
while
thick
remains
plenty
approachable
to
throw
this
one
down
quickly
highly
drinkable
wow
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
really
make
me
wonder
why
i
dont
drink
more
of
this
one
definitely
one
which
was
tried
due
to
commotion
on
the
forums
usually
stirred
up
by
coloradobobs
but
when
you
are
right
you
are
right
damn
good
beer
very
very
drinkable
please
go
get
one
or
two
or
three
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
better
suited
to
a
cool
evening
opposed
to
this
witner
night
the
abv
settels
inwell
in
either
case
though
ultimately
drinkable
i
dont
want
to
give
out
perfect
5s
where
i
have
4
5s
because
i
dont
like
giving
out
perfect
marks
unless
something
is
like
the
greatest
ever
but
this
is
trying
my
resolve
i
guess
one
drawback
is
that
id
like
to
see
it
a
bit
maltier
to
give
it
a
little
more
backbone
but
that
is
forgiveable
coloradobob
gets
great
thanks
for
mentioning
this
in
every
post
ever
but
the
patron
saint
of
vitus
has
it
right
here
this
is
a
musttry
brew
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
love
this
style
and
wish
they
had
more
available
out
there
the
ones
ive
had
had
always
reminded
me
of
a
hefe
combined
with
a
belgian
this
one
reminds
me
of
between
a
hefe
and
a
tripel
great
flavor
and
easy
drinking
even
at
7
7
how
can
you
go
wrong
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
it
has
lots
of
weizen
and
very
little
bock
is
there
a
wheat
ale
they
cant
produce
well
this
is
a
great
way
to
get
summer
flavor
but
with
more
meat
on
its
bones
for
the
winter
d
not
as
good
as
i
had
expected
but
still
this
was
awesome
for
2
99
you
cannot
go
wrong
very
drinkable
worth
seeking
wonderfully
drinkable
7

abv
beer
i
had
been
wondering
what
the
buzz
surrounding
this
beer
and
now
i
know
3

wow
this
tastes
like
a
wiehenstephaner
hefe
with
lots
more
body
very
drinkable
and
tasty
recommended
drinkability
is
good
this
is
just
not
what
one
would
come
to
expect
from
a
weizenbock
for
what
it
is
it
is
a
well
proportioned
and
nicely
crafted
brew
it
is
just
not
malty
enough
for
a
bock
vitus
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
very
large
bright
white
head
that
had
good
retention
for
most
of
the
beer
i
expected
for
this
beer
to
a
bit
darker
the
nose
smells
of
a
good
hefe
with
plenty
of
banana
cloves
and
apples
and
pears
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
to
perfection
but
it
also
adds
in
some
bubblegum
lemons
and
the
classic
wheat
flavor
comes
in
very
nice
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
some
gentle
alcohol
warming
on
the
backend
of
things
this
is
very
drinkable
and
drinks
like
their
regular
hefe
with
more
alcohol
and
plenty
of
flavor
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
lasted
a
while
i
was
surprised
by
the
lightness
of
the
color
the
aroma
was
very
citrusy
the
taste
was
a
flavorful
balance
of
bananas
spice
citrus
and
wheat
the
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
despite
its
7
7
abv
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
that
hides
its
alcohol
well
certainly
one
of
the
best
weizenbocks
out
there
a
must
try
in
my
book
two
finger
head
right
after
a
perfect
pour
but
recedes
to
nothing
after
only
a
few
minutes
good
sunshine
wheat
color
but
a
little
too
clear
for
a
wheat
beer
and
lacking
any
vibrant
bubbling
or
lacing
for
that
matter
the
aroma
is
classic
hefeweiss
lots
of
bananas
sometimes
ripe
and
plenty
of
cloves
plus
the
warmth
of
7
7
abv
is
noticed
a
bit
in
the
nose
sweet
ripe
bananas
and
some
tart
strawberries
start
the
palate
off
then
a
few
herbal
cloves
and
a
little
grassy
hops
with
the
alcohol
cut
some
of
that
malty
sweetness
good
balance
of
hot
sweet
and
herbal
flavors
in
this
beer
very
clean
but
a
litte
palate
as
well
a
little
talcy
but
very
drinkable
considering
the
abv
one
ill
definitely
have
again
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
dvery
drinkable
with
no
trace
of
the
alcohol
dangerously
drinkable
i
am
surprised
it
has
taken
me
this
long
to
try
this
offering
from
a
brewery
i
discovered
a
long
time
ago
the
aroma
was
crisp
and
smelled
of
fruit
primarily
of
bananas
and
citrus
the
taste
was
a
little
bready
with
that
yeast
strain
making
itself
noticed
on
the
back
end
it
left
you
with
a
moderate
bitterness
that
mocked
the
back
of
the
throat
it
was
well
carbonated
and
you
have
a
fruitiness
that
wont
go
away
primarily
the
bananas
overall
this
was
a
wonderful
beer
thanks
to
skinnyelvis
for
this
halloween
08
treat
notes
i
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
this
yet
ive
been
drinking
it
all
summer
thanks
to
the
king
of
vitus
cbobs
a
gem
d
excellent
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
and
any
wheat
beer
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
hard
to
believe
that
its
7
7
so
happy
to
try
on
tap
smooth
body
with
just
a
touch
of
prickleyness
is
that
even
a
word
on
the
tongue
a
little
bit
warming
but
the
alcohol
isnt
really
noticed
extremely
drinkable
the
extra
bottle
i
bought
is
now
gone
ill
be
picking
more
of
this
up
on
my
next
visit
to
the
store
the
alcohol
is
a
little
more
pronounced
the
herbal
character
more
prominent
and
the
mouthfeel
a
touch
less
creamy
great
beer
ive
passed
this
beer
up
over
and
over
again
for
the
last
year
i
like
all
that
weihenstephaner
does
but
i
just
kept
passing
this
one
up
in
favor
of
american
micros
thanks
for
talking
this
up
so
much
coloradobobs
hard
to
tell
when
i
would
have
tried
it
had
it
not
been
for
your
constant
pimping
drinkability
is
huge
got
to
say
bobs
you
called
it
on
this
one
what
else
you
got
overall
this
is
quite
tasty
its
a
bit
different
than
a
traditional
weizenbock
its
quite
tasty
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
still
it
has
tons
of
character
and
satisfies
nicely
my
first
weisenbock
im
enjoying
the
new
flavors
of
which
i
havent
found
in
other
german
styles
nothing
to
compare
it
to
s
till
leaves
me
feeling
this
is
another
best
from
weihenstephaner
pours
a
dirty
murky
straw
color
with
a
tall
dense
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
light
cap
i
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
straw
color
expected
brown
the
aroma
is
fantastic
bananas
and
clove
lemon
and
a
touch
of
metal
the
taste
is
of
banana
creame
pie
the
extra
malt
presence
gives
vitus
a
smoother
taste
than
their
hefe
there
is
a
nice
rustic
and
earthy
flavor
to
this
the
feel
is
moderate
with
soft
carbonation
giving
the
brew
a
velvety
smoothness
finishes
sweet
but
in
balance
very
nice
another
exceptional
brew
from
weihenstephan
great
hefe
flavors
with
a
nice
silky
feel

drinkability
very
good
brew
not
the
sort
of
thing
id
want
every
day
but
this
should
be
enjoyed
at
least
several
times
a
year
ive
never
run
across
a
german
weizenbock
quite
like
this
ive
had
u
s
brewed
imperial
hefes
that
are
a
little
like
this
but
not
nearly
as
good
its
basically
a
big
ass
hefeweizen
suitable
as
a
winter
warmer
with
all
the
refreshing
character
of
a
great
weiss
bier
now
that
i
know
of
this
bier
i
will
probably
have
lots
of
it
d
this
is
very
drinkable
especially
at
7
7
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
would
rank
this
as
second
place
for
weizenbocks
in
my
book
bottom
line
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
weizenbock
and
when
it
comes
down
to
it
i
prefer
it
over
the
also
excellent
aventinus
i
wish
it
was
available
locally
pretty
damn
drinkable
what
a
great
beer
notes
outstanding
revisited

i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
and
probably
will
thanks
coloradobobs
for
making
me
have
this
beer
taste
is
amazing
perfectly
balanced
banana
and
clove
bready
yeast
pepper
and
lemon
hefeweizens
big
brother
but
deeper
and
more
complex
amazingly
refreshing
for
all
this
dances
on
the
tongue
with
phenolic
goodness
and
ample
carbonation
finishes
peppery
and
light
amazingly
drinkable
any
time
a
perfect
summerfall
wheat
ale
d
a
solid
beer
no
question
and
one
i
would
definitely
pick
up
again
d
its
easy
to
drink
this
tasty
brew
drinkability
really
good
for
this
its
refreshing
and
light
on
taste
only
alcohol
level
is
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
with
no
worries
overall
i
really
liked
tihs
beer
and
reccomend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
wheat
or
even
ones
who
think
they
dont
like
wheat
beers
this
could
change
your
mind
my
only
regret
about
this
beer
is
that
i
didnt
buy
a
bunch
of
them
need
to
go
back
and
get
more
really
soon
this
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
one
of
the
most
sessionable
weizenbocks
that
ive
ever
had
its
a
must
try
d
easy
to
finish
id
like
another
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
before
you
know
it
too
bad
its
not
served
at
ball
parks
this
one
would
be
great
sitting
in
the
bleachers
at
wrigley
d
good
and
very
easy
drinking
beer
shocked
to
see
how
high
the
abv
was
similar
to
their
hefe
but
with
more
spice
and
much
more
booze
though
you
wont
notice
it
d
fantastic
beer
only
2
99
but
difficult
to
find
in
my
area
i
will
definitely
pick
up
another
bottle
when
i
see
it
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
nice
tasty
and
easy
drinking
beer
would
be
a
great
go
to
beer
for
the
summer
would
be
more
than
happy
to
sip
this
one
again
sometime
drinkability
this
may
be
my
newest
favorite
beer
with
this
brewery
alcohol
will
catch
up
to
you
but
a
few
of
these
can
easily
be
slowly
consumed
must
try
this
one
delicious
floral
fruity
honey
bumping
the
taste
score
by
a
half
point
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
this
big
another
winner
for
weihenstephan
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
creamy
beige
head
and
excellent
lace
beautifull
looking
brew
just
a
little
light
in
my
opinion
the
nose
has
wheat
malts
citrus
fruits
some
rich
candies
the
taste
is
similar
more
of
a
weizen
than
a
bock
ripe
tropical
fruits
wheaty
grains
spicy
yeasts
and
carmelized
sugars
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
fantastic
drinkability
more
of
an
imperial
hefeweizen
than
a
weizenbock
but
still
very
good
i
am
never
let
down
by
anything
from
weihenstephan
man
im
torn
between
giving
this
a
really
good
review
because
i
thoroughly
enjoy
the
beer
or
giving
it
a
marginal
review
because
i
dont
think
it
represents
the
style
very
well
oh
my
what
a
conundrum
screw
it
its
a
good
beer
even
if
its
not
the
best
weizenbock
its
a
bit
boozy
in
the
end
but
a
totally
drinkable
brew
here
give
me
more
vitus
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
seasons
changing
cool
fall
evenings
thanksgiving
christmas
but
worth
a
try
anytime
if
you
can
get
it
very
approachable
recommended
d
definite
drinkable
i
just
had
a
hard
time
believing
that
this
was
a
weizenbock
very
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
however
i
dont
get
the
complex
dark
fruit
aspect
i
had
expected
from
a
weizenbock
and
the
yeasty
character
was
unexpectedly
strong
instead
i
would
call
this
an
uberhefe
as
this
is
in
my
opinion
a
truly
wonderful
hefe
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
which
it
filled
with
a
giant
gratifying
puffy
head
that
took
its
time
dissipating
unfiltered
so
its
cloudy
in
the
glass
but
still
quite
bright
in
color
the
aroma
is
not
a
typical
wheatbeer
aroma
although
theres
plenty
of
banana
and
clove
a
strong
whiff
of
citrus
is
there
along
with
a
bit
of
what
my
wife
described
as
can
tin
perhaps
the
taste
is
what
you
would
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
but
the
alcohol
is
high
enough
to
add
more
spice
and
some
bitterness
that
a
weizen
with
a
lower
abv
lacks
while
tasty
the
vitus
is
a
bit
too
boozy
a
wheat
beer
for
my
liking
worth
a
try
nonetheless
taste
is
nice
definitely
some
alcohol
there
but
the
fruitiness
carbonation
and
typical
hefeweizenlike
profile
yeasty
phenols
and
the
like
balance
the
booze
luscious
creamy
mouthfeel
one
of
the
most
drinkable
strong
beers
7
7
ive
had
maybe
i
dont
know
any
better
but
the
vitus
is
essentially
like
a
hefeweizen
cranked
up
a
notch
or
two
if
you
want
a
strong
beer
thats
also
refreshing
look
no
further
the
vitus
doesnt
strike
me
as
terribly
complex
and
heavy
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
lingers
making
thick
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
doughy
and
fruity
lots
of
banana
as
is
to
be
expected
taste
moves
from
subtle
fruit
to
sharp
yeast
snap
to
big
clovey
fruit
to
a
hot
hop
bitterness
very
complex
and
delicious
its
got
a
nice
smooth
full
body
to
it
very
foamy
but
not
too
fizzy
its
a
quenching
drink
for
being
so
big
a
beer
i
generally
just
have
one
0
5
l
bottle
at
a
time
plenty
but
not
too
much
d
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
like
their
hefeweizen
amped
up
a
little
it
is
delicious
beer
weihenstaphaner
delivers
yet
again
however
having
more
than
a
couple
could
make
you
start
feeling
a
little
too
good
due
to
the
7
7
alcohol
content
md
a
very
full
bodied
and
chewy
feel
great
carbonation
brings
the
beer
to
life
an
excellent
beer
while
not
your
typical
weizenbock
but
still
damn
tasty
d
great
taste
and
aroma
this
is
definitely
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
first
and
only
beers
ive
had
in
this
style
i
will
definitely
be
exploring
this
style
further
i
still
cant
believe
this
is
german
and
not
belgian
as
the
properties
are
very
similar
it
still
has
that
malty
bock
feel
to
it
though
so
connoisseurs
could
still
identify
this
accurately
but
itd
be
a
tough
call
this
is
like
a
fusion
of
a
german
hefe
and
a
belgian
wit
with
the
abv
of
a
bock
awesomeness
d
wow
this
was
a
damn
good
beer
easily
the
best
german
weiss
bier
i
have
ever
had
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
bunch
more
of
these
in
midmarch
of
2009
vitus
finally
made
it
into
georgia
thanks
to
the
help
of
a
devoted
group
of
vitus
advocates
and
this
led
me
to
discover
that
vitus
purchased
right
here
at
home
looks
smells
tastes
feels
and
generally
drinks
better
than
vitus
purchased
elsewhere
thank

ive
had
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
its
not
at
the
top
of
my
list

i
said
the
alcohol
is
too
prevalent
in

taste
department
not
bad
otherwise

might

it
werent
for
all
the
recent
chatter
about
this
beer
which
is
what
makes

this
one
is

drink

heavy

so
this

if
your
used

drinking
weaker
beers
it
might
be
pretty

out

me
which
makes
me
have

no

just
not
the

weizenbock

was
expecting

as
this
is
the
lightest
weizenbock
i
have
ever
seen
definitely
not

it
certainly
does
fit
the
weizenbock

the
most
complex
beer
of
this
type
but
there
is
certainly
no
way
that
i
would
fail
to
finish
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
most
weizenbocks
have
a
lot
extra
flavor
levels
that
this
one
lacks
but
they
also
have
some
funky
aspects
too
as
a
trade
off
ive
been
buying
and
and
continuing
to
enjoy
it
one
note
i
keep
getting
and
enjoying
is
a
vanilla
character
as
this
one
warms
serving

best
american
weizenbock
ive
had
to

a
touch

sweet

otherwise
a

beer
for
the
price
neshaminy
is
really
progressing
nicely
in
the
beer
game
o
some
good
stuff
going
on
here
but
this
is
a
miss
for
me
honey
bock
sounded
good
too
overall
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
but
the
flavors
are
interesting
as
it
warms
with
deep
sweet
flavors
and
subtle
banana
nice
to
see
this
style
on
the
us
shores
a
bit
sweet
but
even
some
of
the
german
varieties
are
guilty
of
that
dark
brown
body
with
near
perfect
beige
head
thick
and
creamy
coats
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
raisins
taste
is
also
led
by
the
sweetness
but
with
the
body
of
a
decent

nice

and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
overall
a
fruity
and
sweet
weizenbock
with
nice
big
and
thick
flavors
and
a
great
feel
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
robust
brew
that
is
nice
for
the
cooler
winter
weather
this
is
the
best
weizenbock
from
a
us
craft
brewery
ive
had
so
far
it
has
the
banana
fruity
esters
sweet
malt
rum
and
dark
fruits
along
with
a
signature
hint
of
honey
in
addition
this
complex
bock
has
coffee
dark
chocolate
burnt
wood
and
friendly
hop
finish
that
does
not
destroy
all
of
the
other
great
flavors
similar
to
the
neshaminy
creek
dunks
ferry
dunkelweizen
times
two
or
the
punkel
dunkel
without
the
pumpkin
or
spices
this
is
exactly
what
i
had
hoped
for
in
their
weizenbock
definitely
more
intense
than
an
ayinger
and
more
charred
oak
intensity
than
an
erdinger
pikantus
i
will
be
drinking
this
whenever
i
can
find
it
o
a
good
representation
of
the
style
refreshing
if
you
like
hefeweizen
this
is
a
sort
of
darker
version
o
american
weizenbock
says
it
well
not
my
normal
style
but
would
defiantly
get
it
again
good
flavor
and
not
overaly
spiced
and
no
funky
aftertaste
interesting
would
not
choose
to
drink
it
again
moon
glow
is
a
good
american
style
weizenbock
that
is
darker
and
has
more
malt
than
its
german
counterparts
another
stellar
brew
from
victory
o
a
good
beer
but
i
would
kind
of
like
the
booze
to
not
be
so
apparent
maybe
a
bit
of
aging
could
help
either
way
one
im
glad
i
revisited
as
ive
not
had
it
in
a
long
time
overall
a
very
good
weizenbock
and
one
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
despite
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
would
definitely
get
this
one
again

certainly

on
this
one
however
o
im
pretty
sure
anything
would
taste
good
right
now
but
this
definitely
has
it
going
on
so
glad
that
i
could
get
to
try
this
overall
a
nice
beer
glad
i
tried
it
not
a
particular
standout
imo
the
quintessential
american
weizenbock
better
then
many

examples

theres
really
nothing
else
going
on
a
note
of
brown
bread
its
enjoyable
and
well
its
hard
to
completely
whiff
on
this
style
but
its
not
even
on
the
same
field
as
a
poormans
version
of
aventinus
2014
fall
bottling
o
picked
this
bottle
up
out
of
curiosity
i
dont
usually
like
the
belgian
yeast
taste
and
shy
away
from
beers
like
this
but
this
was
very
good
for
both
taste
and
mouth
feel
would
drink
again
muddy
copper
nose
is
bready
and
that
old
familiar
funk
is
also
present
nutty
but
not
really
getting
the
traditional
banana
notes
the
finish
is
slightly
cidery
the
beer
has
high
carbonation
and
tastes
very
much
like
a
traditional
german
stalwarts
in
the
style
a
wonderful
american
attempt
at
the
style
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
it
had
all
the
key
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
with
the
carbonation
being
the
only
aspect
that
felt
a
little
out
of
place
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
pretty
crisp
slightly
prickly
just
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
two
would
be
my
limit
anymore
than
that
and
i
think
the
prickly
carbonation
would
start
to
wear
on
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
aroma
and
appearance
they
were
all
very
nice
and
they
worked
really
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
felt
like
the
carbonation
was
a
little
too
lively
for
the
style
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
if
i
see
it
and
i
will
for
sure
get
some
next
year
if
shows
up
in
my
area
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
it
does
a
good
job
at
showing
what
the
style
all
about
and
its
good
example
of
a
american
made
weizenbock
all
in
all
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
it
did
a
good
job
at
satisfying
my
urge
for
a
good
weizenbock
it
isnt
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
victory
beers
ive
had
great
job
guys
this
was
one
tasty
weizenbock
keep
up
the
good
work
guys

yet
another
rocksolid
victory
beer
ive
had
a
few
outstanding
beers
from
victory
lately
and
this
is
no
exception
no
objections
here
if
they
want
to
make
this
available
yearround
overall
not
bad
but
just
left
too
sweet
in
the
bottle
and
yeast
just
took
over
shouldnt
be
that
old
either
but
at
least
its
not
too
sweet
some
candy
was
nice
darker
dried
candied
fruits
were
nice
and
the
wheat
was
nice
just
not
the
yeast
and
alcohol
was
a
bit
much
it
was
a
nice
sipper
for
a
cold
almost
winter
night
but
bit
more
than
i
expected
the
somewhat
dry
finish
was
also
a
nice
surprise
not
as
sticky
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
murky
medium
brown
billowing
khaki
head
aroma
is
pear
skin
bruised
apple
banana
clove
orange
and
lemon
which
contrast
brown
sugar
nutty
malt
and
rummy
booze
notes
theres
a
touch
of
white
pepper
very
complex
flavor
reveals
tart
apple
and
pear
skin
on
a
slightly
sweet
toasted
bready
malt
backbone
with
notes
of
banana
and
pepper
surfacing
late
the
finish
is
dry
and
a
touch
bitter
wish
the
pear
and
apple
were
dialed
down
a
bit
too
allow
the
malt
to
shine
more
but
a
great
beer
falls
a
little
flat
in
the
finish
o
this
is
a
damn
fine
weizenbock
lots
of
fruity
flavors
make
this
a
tasty
seasonal
this
is
a
great
representation
of
a
weizenbock
reminds
me
of
a
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
dunkel
meets
weihenstephaner
vitus
has
those
banana
esters
one
would
expect
from
those
german
versions
its
a
great
beer
and
i
plan
on
drinking
this
often
i
rank
this
one
of
my
top
5
if
not
top
3
offerings
from

a
very
nice
weizenbock

version
made
here

pumpkin

i
really
wish
more
breweries
would
make
a
beer
like
this
a
very
well
executed
beer
by
victory
yet
again
first
bock
style
i
have
had
i
am
now
just
afraid
the
rest
wont
measure
up
mostly
medium
bodied
lighter
effervescence
warming
and
relatively
smooth
except
on
the
tongue
at
first
sip
where
it
is
a
bit
sharp
not
as
good
as
aventinus
but
a
very
good
brew
to
be
certain
i
like
this
brew
it
has
an
intensity
on
the
palate
banana
aroma
bubblegum
notes
and
lemon
lime
overall
as
good
as
the
german
ones
nice
alternative
when
the
german
weizenbock
are
not
available
very
tasty
and
true
to
style
cheers
overall
never
had
this
beer
before
have
been
wanting
to
try
it
and
lo
and
behold
fourpacks
are
on
sale
for
7

at
jenny
st
market
this
is
quite
possibly
the
best
weizenbock
ive
ever
had
and
is
certainly
up
there
with
aventinus
just
a
wonderful
beer
prost
overall
a
fruity
imperial
style
of
weisenbock
that
channels
a
pleasant
autumn
spice
with
terrific
balance
and
solid
drinkability
stock
a
few
for
the
upcoming
season
o
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
an
americanbrewed
one
no
less
victory
does
a
great
job
with
german
styles
and
this
one
is
no
exception
sneakily
drinkable
for
being
nearly
9
and
a
really
nice
when
the
weather
is
starting
to
get
cooler
definitely
worth
trying
if
youre
into
stronger
brews
or
wheat
beers
pours
a
deep
cloudy
brown
with
a
longlasting
creamy
white

small

is

the
aroma
is
pleasant
fruity
banana
and
apple
just
like
they
said
and
yeasty
the
taste
is
is
equally
pleasant
with
the
same
flavor
profile
as
the
aroma
and
it
blends
together
well
the
body
is
a
little
thinner
and
just
right
a
great
beer
if
i
did
a
blindfold
test
i
would
chosen
this
beer
as
german
brewed
it
has
german
whole
hops
and
malts
it
is
the
best
american
weizenbock
i
have
tasted
complex
flavor
of
bananas
german
bread
booze
brown
sugar
and
moderate
carbonation
tasty
overall
a
fairly
nice
drinking
brew
a
decent
level
of
booziness
but
all
very
well
balanced
out
by
the
wheat
fruit
and
yeasty
spiced
flavors
of
the
beer
rather
tasty
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
craftsmanship
is
very
impressive
im
glad
victory
decided
to
brew
this

the

very
attractive

as
well
glad
i
was

to
try
this
seasonal

by

if

are
looking
for
a

authentic

and
these
are
available
give
them
a
shot
ill
bet
it
would
be
great
on
tap
this
is
an
impressively
balanced
weizenbock
it
errs
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
goes
down
easily
and
makes
for
a
fantastic
fall

hidden
would
definitely
drink
again
but
wont
seek
out
with
the
first
sip
i
can
tell
this
is
not
my
favorite
but
with
all
victory
beers
you
can
taste
the
smooth
quality
and
obvious
craftsmanship
of
a
great
beer
for
some
reason
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
a
little
lower
in
abv
and
a
bit
lighter
in
taste
as
this
would
make
a
great
2nd
or
3rd
beer
for
a
great
evening
poured
a
dark
copper
with
a
nice
head
to
it
medium
body
and
as
i
mentioned
above
very
smooth
eric
dont
see
too
many
american
made
versions
of
this
style
loved
getting
a
chance
to
try
this
one
o
a
soupedup
dunkel
this
beer
begs
to
be
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
some
big
dunkels
leave
quite
a
bit
of
sugar
around
but
not
this
one
over
time
the
spice
from
the
yeast
takes
over
the
finish
and
prevents
the
cloying
that
makes
many
a
oneglass
option
towards
the
end
of
the
growler
a
sense
of
cinnamon
emerged
barrel
aging
would
sand
this
down
a
bit
and
make
the
sugars
more
complex
a
late
fall
beer
i
can
see
this
pairing
well
with
pumpkin
pie
paired
against
its
spice
and
real
whipped
cream
or
with
a
rubbedandgrilled
pork
roast
and
sauerkraut
in
any
case
this
is
a
beer
constructed
to
be
drunk
slowly
and
matched
with
food
andor
a
cigar
with
body
3
75
feel
smooth
warm
low
carbonation
medium
body
o
fairly
easy
to
drink
considering
the
abv
which
is
well
hidden
in
this
brew
there
is
a
nice
complexity
and
balance
to
the
flavor
making
this
one
quite
enjoyable
edit
after
having
some
more
examples
of
this
style
i
decided
this
beer
is
definitely
too
sweet
for
the
style
and
a
bit
cloying
when
compared
to
its
german
brethren
that
tend
to
be
much
more
drinkable
a
lightly
hazed
light
chestnut
brown
in
my
300
ml
aventinus
glass
very
good
sized
head
that
stays
for
quite
a
while
and
covers
the
beer
all
the
way
down
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
some
stickiness
in
the
fluid
evident
smell
is
sweet
with
banana
alcohol
and
caramel
lovely
warm
dark
bread
aromas
taste
is
full
of
overripe
banana
and
clove
raisins
and
dark
fruity
sweetness
wheat
malt
twang
cuts
through
with
a
dark
toasted
nuttiness
and
caramel
vanilla
notes
alcohol
is
well
integrated
and
not
overpowering
fell
is
velvety
with
a
silky
carbonation
and
a
smoothness
to
the
swallow
aventinus
sets
such
a
high
bar
to
touch
that
i
am
doubley
impressed
by
the
overall
excellence
of
this
brew
it
is
so
close
that
i
would
not
be
surprised
by
someone
preferring
the
domestic
version
its
that
good
o
a
style
i
definitely
look
forward
to
every
yearmore
so
than
the
myriad
pumpkin
beers
this
fits
well
and
will
probably
make
an
annual
tradition
overall
a
great
beer
of
a
great
style
o
overall
this
is
the
first
weizenbock
ive
ever
had
i
didnt
think
i
would
like
this
style
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
enjoyable
the
high
abv
will
certainly
have
you
feeling
fuzzy
after
just
a
few
as
mentioned
above
i
would
go
with
the
smaller
glass
and
not
let
it
warm
too
much
unless
you
enjoye
a
strong
alcohol
presence
in
your
beer
which
i
do
not
would
certainly
try
this
again
appearance
is
amberbrown
and
really
deep
slightly
cloudy
with
a
great
head
and
nice
spider
web
lacing
on
the
glass
through
consumption
smell
is
malty
sweet
with
molasses
and
maybe
a
hint
of
caramel
taste
is
sweet
with
nice
body
and
good
depth
of
flavor
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
last
had
this
beer
but
very
pleasantly
surprised
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
interpretations
of
the
weizenbock
ive
had
recently
but
still
not
up
to
par
with
the
great
german
examples

a

mars
an
otherwise
very
nice
beer
worth
revisiting
oa
nice
weizenbock
really
think
this
is
an
under
made
style
as
further
exemplified
in
the
feel
a
lush
rich
but
not
too
heavy
free
flowing
creamy
and
crisp
medium
body
great
stuff
all
around
here
nothing
more
to
say
except
make
this
the
first
beer
of
your
day
savor
it
pennsylvania
rocks
out
some
great
german
beer
styles
moonglow
is
no
exception
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
caramel
malt
with
quite
a
bit
of
clove
and
banana
mixed
in
the
flavor
has
some
additional
notes
i
get
a
lot
of
caramel
and
toffee
as
well
as
some
cloves
pepper
and
spices
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
banana
as
well
as
some
alcohol
medium
full
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
a
damn
nice
stab
at
a
classic
bavarian
style
victory
nails
down
the
most
important
aspects
and
delivers
a
winner
highly
recommended
overall
an
excellent
weizenbock
overall
this
is
a
smooth
and
enjoyable
beer
the
malts
and
spice
blend
together
very
well
the
alcohol
is
heavy
but
not
overly
boozy
nonetheless
this
a
solid
take
on
the
german
style
o
this
is
the
first
beer
from
victory
that
i
have
liked
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
think
i
could
get
a
buzz
on
a
few
of
these
easy
drinkers
for
such
a
high
alcohol
content
all
the
flavors
do
a
perfect
job
of
masking
it
very
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
a
pleasant
surprise
o
there
are
all
kinds
of
flavors
going
on
here
but
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
yet
another
example
of
why
victory
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
highly
recommend
moonglow
and
will
definitely
get
it
again
refreshing
and
satisfying
at
once
this
is
superbly
easy
to
drink
enjoy
either
with
a
hearty
lunch
or
early
dinner
perhaps
as
something
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
regardless
moonglow
is
a
winner
overall
a
major
disappointment
the
overwrought
bitterness
and
alcohol
just
swamp
anything
i
might
enjoy
about
the
flavor
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
the
style
thought
i
was
going
to
get
hit
with
lots
of
banana
and
clove
but
there
is
a
wide
array
of
fruit
and
spices
here
well
done
exquisite
mahogony
tone
with
an
orange
tinge
thick
and
foggy
creamy
off
white
head
down
to
clumps
lots
of
banana
on
the
nose
with
peanut
butter
and
chocolate
truffle
very
complex
flavor
including
caramel
clove
citrus
hop
bitterness
chemically
aftertaste
very
full
bodied
and
refreshing
smooth
yet
crispy
what
a
great
offering
from
victory
relatively
high
abv
odoverall
it
was
alright
not
as
good
as
a
few
others
i
have
tried
from
the
same
style
not
very
high
on
drinkablility
too
pricey
too
at
nearly
13
a
six
pack
one
single
will
permanently
be
enough
for
me
no
date
on
this
bottle
yeasty
chunks
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
wonder
if
its
been
around
a
while
im
sure
ive
liked
this
better
a
year
or
two
ago
medium
bodied
it
doesnt
coat
your
tongue
very
much
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
it
left
a
somewhat
unpleasant
taste
in
my
mouth
at
the
very
end
which
i
couldnt
identify
bottom
line
its
a
spicy
yeasty
fruity
and
lively
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
heat
and
a
mildly
dry
finish
well
played
ill
continue
sipping
enjoying
this
one
thick
and
silky
rich
and
buttery
not
bad
so
far
in
the
least
big
and
chewy
with
a
banana
bread
presence
super
creamy
and
rich
too
slight
hop
presence
but
i
wish
it
was
bigger
to
really
give
this
beer
some
balls
excellent
though
i
couldnt
tell
what
kind
of
fruit
i
was
tasting
but
it
was
a
good
what
i
really
liked
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
of
fruit
and
alcohol
and
hops
in
the
taste
i
would
love
to
have
this
beer
again
anyday
oa
nice
smooth
drinking
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
with
zesty
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
sweet
grainy
finish
thats
slightly
funky
from
the
yeast
interesting
and
pretty
drinkable
another
fine
mix
of
two
styles
that
worked
well
together
reddish
brown
in
color
with
orangish
hues
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
and
a
deep
haze
poured
with
a
short
off
white
foam
that
reduced
to
sparce
wisps
wheat
malt
and
ripe
apple
and
banana
aromas
hick
smooth
feel
sweet
caramel
and
wheat
malt
flavors
up
front
followed
instantly
by
dark
fruit
and
banana
spicy
herbal
tangy
flavor
through
the
middle
to
the
finish
started
to
show
a
bit
of
boozy
character
at
the
finish
as
this
warmed
a
bit
very
easy
to
to
drink
would
certainly
have
this
again
92100
its
not
on
the
bottle
something
new
for
victory
but
victorys
web
page
states
the
abv
to
be
8
7
nowhere
is
this
noticeable
to
me
this
is
the
most
flavorful
ive
had
of
the
style
and
a
very
enjoyable
beer
ill
definitely
pick
up
some
more
of
this
next
season
hv
a
hazy
dark
copper
beer
with
a
fourfinger
head
although
minimal
lacing
and
a
sweet
toffeelike
nose
with
some
fruity
notes
i
found
it
quite
complex
on
the
tonguecaramel
raisins
and
apples
some
yeast
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
and
clove
and
a
very
long
finish
with
lots
of
clove
on
the
tongue
even
a
minute
after
the
swallow
and
a
lovely
warming
quality
yum
what
a
great
late
fall
beer
moonglow
weizenbock
pours
a
copper
color
w
orange
highlights
very
murky
in
appearance
the
one
finger
cocoa
head
quickly
disappears
down
to
a
sliver
lacing
is
good
the
nose
i
get
is
mainly
clove
banana
apple
malt
bread
very
nicely
blended
into
a
good
cold
weather
brew
ah
the
taste
takes
it
up
a
notch
everything
in
the
nose
is
here
and
its
blended
very
well
its
close
to
a
4
5
but
ill
leave
it
at
a
4
for
now
the
flavors
really
come
alive
in
this
beer
and
the
spices
are
very
well
done
feel
is
mediumfull
w
some
big
time
carbonation
on
the
back
end
and
aftertaste
big
spices
on
the
aftertaste
as
well
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
there
isnt
more
presence
from
the
malt
overall
a
solid
brew
from
victory
overall
its
pretty
good
nothing
great
appearance
is
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
tan
head
had
to
be
patient
with
the
pour
and
wait
for
the
beautiful
dense
head
to
fade
a
bit
not
much
lacing
left
behind
scents
are
mainly
fruity
orange
peel
and
lemon
with
a
little
wheat
as
well
the
smell
could
use
a
little
more
oomph
though
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
the
taste
it
combines
the
flavors
of
a
wit
with
a
hefeweizen
and
boy
is
it
good
banana
and
bread
give
a
bubble
gumlike
sweetness
and
a
twinge
of
lemon
gives
a
perfect
amount
of
tartness
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
though
carbonation
is
high
this
is
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
ive
had
victory
has
a
winner
o
i
found
the
moonglow
weizenbock
to
be
an
amazingly
tasty
brew
victory
makes
some
excellent
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
refreshing
and
delicious
overall
great
effort
here
tasty
and
a
good
late
autumearly
winter
brew
imo
overall
seems
like
this
is
very
well
done
for
the
style
o
overall
a
pretty
good
weizenbock
although
i
dont
think
this
years
is
as
good
as
last
years
o
im
impressed
this
beer
was
very
enjoyable
for
both
taste
and
mouthfeel
my
4s
are
riding
on
the
high
end
of
the
spectrum
so
this
beer
probably
should
get
a
higher
grade
then
i
gave
it
i
would
give
this
beer
my
full
recommendation
and
i
hope
the
other
beers
of
this
style
live
up
to
the
expectation
that
this
beer
gave
me
the
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
overall
pretty
much
what
i
was
expecting
here
victory
continues
to
be
old
reliable
notes
quite
the
tasty
brew
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
cheers
do
drinkability
is
high
this
is
my
first
time
trying
it
out
of
the
bottle
but
it
is
every
bit
as
good
as
from
tap
insanely
drinkable
given
the
complexity
and
alcohol
and
it
constantly
draws
me
in
to
drink
more
and
with
every
sip
you
get
different
flavors
as
the
temperature
change
draws
out
different
elements
this
beer
is
definitely
in
contention
for
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
victory
drawing
neck
and
neck
with
storm
king
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
this
one
before
now
especially
considering
how
many
times
ive
had
it
and
enjoyed
it
it
pours
a
murky
rusty
sunset
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
creamtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
banana
clove
light
nutmeg
rye
bread
dark
wheat
and
a
touch
of
raisins
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
an
emphasis
on
the
wheat
banana
clove
and
raisin
a
touch
of
cinnamon
is
added
in
for
good
measure
everything
just
melds
beautifully
and
tastily
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
highly
enjoyable
weizenbock
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
baby
o
this
was
an
amazing
weizenbock
great
to
drink
on
a
nice
fall
day
so
good
that
it
prompted
me
to
write
my
first
review
on
this
sit
about
it
good
job
victory
o
another
great
beer
from
victory
i
found
this
very
easy
to
drink
and
well
balanced
really
cant
wait
to
drink
more
and
try
more
weizenbocks
this
beer
is
great
the
man
at
the
store
hit
it
on
the
nose
the
poor
mans
aventinus
i
regret
having
bought
only
a
single
of
this
aventinus
is
my
gold
standard
for
a
wheat
doppelbock
and
this
one
stacks
up
remarkably
well
next
time
ill
serve
it
in
the
aventinus
glass
thatll
probably
accent
the
nose
even
better
im
getting
a
sixpack
of
this
some
for
now
some
for
winter
some
for
next
winter
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
was
such
a
smooth
velvety
and
easy
drinking
offering
that
im
tempted
to
rethink
my
stance
wow
this
is
8
7
even
better
a
solid
beer
that
suits
cooler
fall
nights
perfectly
an
excellent
rendition
of
the
style
flavors
of
banana
and
spices
create
a
rich
full
flavor
that
follows
through
in
every
sip
a
unique
yeast
strain
gives
this
beer
a
distinctive
taste
on
the
back
of
the
palate
that
rounds
out
the
big
banana
notes
the
spiciness
is
very
prevelant
as
well
as
a
hint
of
cinnamon
giving
the
spices
a
sweet
almost
pielike
taste
other
spices
are
remeniscent
of
an
herb
garden
but
it
blanaces
and
works
nearly
perfectly
in
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
not
in
your
face
but
is
noticeable
when
looked
for
it
creates
a
deceptively
easy
to
drink
beer
as
it
goes
down
fast
and
easy
the
mouthfeel
is
as
silky
smooth
as
the
head
looks
with
a
clean
and
dry
finish
that
complements
the
flavors
oh
so
well
the
mouthfeel
here
actually
makes
the
beer
as
awesome
as
it
is
by
adding
a
layer
of
texture
that
is
nothing
but
pleasant
this
beer
is
very
complex
but
so
enjoyable
and
fullflavored
that
its
simple
to
drink
i
really
like
this
one
and
once
again
victory
has
impressed
me
cheers
definitely
solid
and
more
than
drinkable
pours
a
very
hazy
dark
amber
with
a
fair
head
smells
nicely
of
banana
and
some
spice
as
well
as
some
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
similar
but
with
an
added
layer
of
hoppy
bitterness
that
joins
the
lush
banana
clove
and
other
yeast
notes
nice
deep
flavors

just
enough
residual
sweetness

dark
copper
with

is

mouth
is

baked

with

light

brown
color
smells

a

as
it

taste
is
caramel
spice
and
bitter
hops
decent
interesting
id
agree
with
the
label
about
subtle
but
i
dont
really
find
it
fruity
or
deep
in
the
spices
yet
still
another
nice
beer
from
victory
do
wow
i
feel
if
this
were
to
be
more
eyeappealing
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
as
it
stands
smells
and
tastes
great
appearance
keeps
it
out
of
the
upper
tier
of
weizenbocks
would
have
again
in
the
future
and
cross
my
fingers
a
really
good
weizenbock
from
victory
strangely
enough
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
them
to
date
though
i
havent
had
a
huge
number
and
its
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
i
would
certainly
have
this
again
o
i
think
a
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
would
appreciate
it
much
more
than
i
did
it
was
an
interesting
experience
that
i
would
try
again
but
couldnt
do
it
too
often
my
scores
are
higher
than
my
personal
opinion
but
factor
in
the
beer
style
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
for
the
style
especially
for
an
american
brewery
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
though
i
do
feel
it
could
have
been
tamed
slightly
for
drinkability
and
appeal
still
the
flavors
are
immensely
pronounced
and
the
brew
is
refreshing
a
bold
example
of
the
style
pour
was
a
deep
gold
with
a
good
deal
of
haze
sweet
with
pronounced
bock
character
spicyness
and
heat
from
the
alcohol
follow
the
initial
sweetness
in
close
order
bittersweet
toward
the
finish
with
yeast
notes
might
be
a
little
heavyhanded
but
enjoyable
o
at
first
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
specific
beer
but
each
time
i
have
one
it
continues
to
grow
on
me
first
time
with
this
type
of
beer
and
ill
definitely
try
this
beer
or
a
similar
kind
again
overall
unique
take
on
a
bavarian
weizenbock
very
flavorful
not
in
the
same
league
as
aventinus
but
still
another
nice
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
point
from
victory
o
very
neat
beer
first
of
this
style
that
i
have
ever
had
i
would
try
others
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
cream
colored
foamy
head
the
head
shrinks
down
and
leaves
a
film
over
top
of
the
beer
the
lacing
on
this
one
is
decent
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
banana
and
wheaty
grains
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
little
spicy
and
has
a
decent
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
i
thought
but
had
a
pretty
texture
for
the
style
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
and
id
drink
it
again
o
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
weizenbock
and
i
was
impressed
with
the
style
and
flavor
of
this
brew
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
would
drink
it
again
when
available
o
a
very
good
weizenbock
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
grab
the
next
time
i
see
it
i
gravitate
toward
the
style
when
i
can
find
it
and
this
is
a
great
representation
this
is
a
very
nice
rendition
of
the
style
and
strikes
me
as
one
of
victorys
best
executed
beers
it
is
true
to
style
and
excellently
made
with
a
good
amount
of
balance
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
a
beer
that
i
can
see
myself
coming
back
to
o
this
is
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
am
not
sure
if
aging
it
for
months
helped
it
or
detracted
from
it
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
the
taste
just
sends
me
over
the
top
victory
rarely
lets
me
down
d
awesome
possibly
a
little
too
much
nutmegspiciness
to
it
then
again
ive
never
had
the
style
so
thats
my
fault
truly
a
wonderful
beer
this
beer
is
still
good
but
much
better
fresh
at
least
i
got
to
get
my
weizenbock
fever
out
of
the
way
because
i
probably
wont
see
this
again
until
fall
the
noticable
changes
in
taste
as
you
drink
it
reminds
me
of
those
candies
on
willy
whonka
that
change
flavors
all
the
way
up
until
the
blueberry
pie
pours
a
ruby
leaning
towards
a
browner
shade
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
bubbly
and
loaded
with
yeast
particles
smells
of
banana
clove
grass
sweet
corn
grape
a
bit
of
shoyu
and
some
faint
rum
scents
taste
is
very
grapey
like
red
wine
something
i
can
only
describe
as
a
rounded
mustiness
sweet
and
nutty
with
some
apple
juice
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
mouth
watering
with
medium
carbonation
a
very
delicious
beer
overall
showcasing
the
belgian
yeast
complexity
very
well
mouthfeel
drinkability
i
didnt
find
this
very
drinkable
the
taste
was
overall
too
sweet
for
me
and
entirely
too
full
of
raisins
and
dates
for
a
weizenbock
it
wasnt
too
terrible
but
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
this
beer
lacked
anything
special
to
make
me
want
to
finish
an
entire
bottle
medium
bodied
and
on
the
verge
of
being
heavy
overall
tastes
like
some
sort
of
overpowered
breakfast
juice
this
is
a
damn
good
weizenbock

of

favorites

poured
into

was

so
was
the

the
smells
of
banana

were
found
here
with
a
pungency
that
other
weizens
rarely
ever
exhibit
the
taste
was
again
very
similar
to
a

some

at

to
really

some

its

and
never

the
nuance
develop
if

the
response

not

final
thoughts
all
in
all
a
serviceable
weizenbock
im
probably
not
being
very
charitable
as
weihenstephaner
vitus
is
the
only
other
beer
of
this
style
ive
tried
and
it
blows
this
stuff
out
of
the
water
however
there
is
very
little
to
complain
about
other
then
the
carbonation
is
odd
really
give
it
a
whirl
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
something
id
particularly
reach
for
again
the
taste
is
just
a
bit
too
one
dimensional
for
me
im
overall
becoming
quite
a
fan
of
mill
st
though
this
being
the
4th
beer
ive
tried
from
them
a
decent
bigboy
weizenbock
if
perhaps
one
that
relies
a
bit
too
much
on
the
bananayeast
sledgehammer
rather
than
a
more
subtle
touch
to
get
its
point
across
overall
worthy
of
a
go
for
its
warming
nature
as
well
as
the
unexpected

a
wellearned
b
mill
streets
weizenbock
is
a
serviceable
example
of
the
style
though
it
really
cant
hold
a
candle
to
the
german
imports
the
yeastiness
is
there
but
the
wheat
malts
simply
lack
the
same
aggressiveness
and
complexity
of
the
paragons
of
this
style
id
get
this
again
if
the
price
was
right
and
it
makes
for
a
somewhat
memorable
conclusion
to
this
seasons
new
sampler
pack
as
an
addendum
i
am
psyched
that
they
opted
to
exclude
the
stock
ale
and
include
another
seasonal
in
its
place
the
organic
lager
does
the
same
job
better
anyway
variety
is
the
spice
of
life
overall
nice
beer
but
would
rather
have
some
of
their
other
offerings
and
there
are
definitely
better
weizenbocks
out
there
nonetheless
a
good
effort
which
has
come
in
no
small
part
because
of
their
willingness
and
ability
to
offer
more
integral
less
common
and
frankly
much
more
interesting
beers
than
its
competitors
this
weizenbock
albeit
not
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
is
indisputably
wellmade
and
well
worth
drinking
i
cant
wait
to
fill
this
growler
with
other
quality
mill
street
brew
a
very
solid
weizenbock
a
bit
more
depth
and
richness
to
the
flavour
would
be
more
down
my
alley
but
this
is
a
great
stab
at
the
style
from
a
local
brewer
nice
work
joel
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
i
think
like
a
poor
mans
aventinus
which
is
a
compliment
overall
once
again
southern
tier
makes
me
happy
a
repeat
buy
next
year
maybe
glad
i
tried
it
today
yes
definitely
onot
a
bad
beer
not
as
good
as
a
lot
of
southern
tiers
other
offerings
the
taste
is
a
nice
malty
balanced
taste
that
has
a
little
hops
that
shine
through
too
its
a
dangerously
easy
drinking
big
beer
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
the
style
is
meant
to
be
that
way
drank
exclusively
in
quantity
and
it
works
southern
tier
took
the
style
and
made
it
their
own
an
interesting
weizenbock
hops
are
more
moderate
than
mild
overall
a
pleasant
unique
brew
fab
brew
for
pairing
with
prince
edward
island
mussels
belgian
style
of
course
the
beer
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
natural
flavor
not
bitter
to
the
pure
tongue
southern
tier
lightly
hopped
perfect
for
the
ladies
that
dont
drink
beer
everyday
caramelized
bananas
and
sweet
malts
should
create
for
a
smoother
tastier
experience
i
would
definitely
let
this
one
age
for
some
reason
this
just
didnt
work
for
me
at
7
5
abv
i
would
argue
that
this
should
not
be
called
an
imperial
weizenbock
despite
this
its
a
nice
weizenbock
albeit
no
cloves
less
banana
and
more
bitterness
than
its
german
parent

the

it

but
when
youre
at
the
low
end
of
the
abvetc
for
the
style
you
look
like
a
jerk
st
has
plenty
of
hits
and
their
fair
share
of
misses
this
is
among
the
latter
a
nice
banana
like
after
taste
very
smooth
going
down
very
tasty
the
taste
is
also
bready
with
a
meaty
fruit
character
and
a
bigger
bitterness
than
i
expected
i
have
great
respect
for
southern
tier
but
this
was
a
miss
for
me
i
got
some
average
bock
flavors
but
no
bananas
as
the
label
indicated
the
label
was
far
superior
to
the
beer
i
dont
know
why
i
dont
like
this
beer
by
all
prospects
and
smell
i
should
but
it
just
tastes
like
im
drinking
a

never
had
this
type
of
beer
before
but
wasnt
to
bad
i
dont
think
this
holds
up
too
well
when
compared
with
the
best
of
this
style
there
arent
many

just
very

o

effervescence

sadly
finish
is
a

medium

full
bodied
with
average
carbonation
has
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
which
i
am
not
used
to
in
this
style
of
beer
this
is
a
good
to
very
good
weizenbock
but
there
are
better
ones
than
this
o
this
is
way
better
on
draught
the
banana
and
bread
notes
work
better
in
the
bottle
it
gets
muddled
into
this
hot
mess
of
flavors
that
dont
work
well
together
o
very
banana
and
malt
forward
so
if
you
like
the

this

overall

for

i
might
have
rated
this

between

and

50
ill
buy
another
bottle
in
the
future
to
see
if
it
has
changed
pretty
straight

was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
unique
still
a
pretty
solid
beer
smells
like
cloves

slightly
earthyfunky

and
sweet
tastes
like

toasted

bread
banana
fairly
sweet
with
the
banana

really
plowing

it

also

thats
to

enjoyed

this

really
hit

spot

that

not

the
best

overall
a
good
weizenbock
i
tend
to
like
southern

bombers
and
this
lives
up

expectations
i
will
get
this
again
if
i
want
this

overall
a
nice
beer
but
not

if
its
some
i
would
have
some
then
once
in

glad
to
try
it
a

sweet

very
reminiscent
of
banana
bread
somewhat
of
a
guilty
pleasure
beer
im
on
the
fence
whether
i
would
want
to
try
this
again
o
enjoyable
but
not
great
i
really
enjoy
most
southern
tier
brews
especially
the
ones
that
are
in
the
bombers
but
this
one
just
was
not
as
enjoyable
as
others
in
the
style
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
though
it
is
a
touch
too
sweet
for
me
flavor
has
some
malty
sweet
notes
akin
to
a
combo
of
rummy
brownbread
and
banana
bread
it
has
a
healthy
amount
of
clove
here
too
plus
more
hints
of
choco

a

i
used
to
not
be
a
fan
of
german
wheat
beers
but
beers
like
this
are
going
to
be
my
inroad
the
alcohol
essence
on
the
finish
was
quite
surprising
since
this
is
only
a
7
5
abv
and
st
is
generally
good
at
hiding
the
alcohol
in
their
higher
abv
beers
overall
once
again
southern
tier
puts
out
another
solid
beer
i
could
revisit
this
one
again
this
was
very
heavy
on
the
sweet
side
tone
that
down
a
bit
and
you
would
have
something
here
medium
body
with
a
zesty
spice
presence
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
prominent
yeast
and
citrus
sweetness
into
a
tart
dry
finish
lots
of
clove
and
other
peppery
spices
up
front
followed
by
hints
of
sourdough
bread
banana
and
citrus
sweet
malt
backbone
with
caramel
toffee
and
light
chocolate
followed
by
zesty
orange
peel
in
the
finish
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
aroma
but
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
with
some
nice
flavors
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
malt
sweetnesssilky
chocolate
notes
to
counter
the
heavy
spice
and
pithy
citrus
the
beer
was
clean
but
i
can
not
say
crisp
i
was
waiting
for
something
more
to
happen
with
the
taste
or
with
the
finish
but
none
of
this
seem
to
be
happening
i
love
it
when
you
can
really
see
the
amount
of
sediment
in
an
unfiltered
beer
the
appearance
was
a
light
hazel
color
with
a
fizzy
head
with
bits
of
the
sediment
sticking
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
sweet
almost
banana
with
almost
a
mint
characteristic
to
the
wheat
smell
the
taste
was
great
full
yet
not
too
filling
or
overpowering
a
lot
of
wheat
and
the
end
had
a
sweet
taste
about
it
from
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
very
refreshing
despite
its
weight
i
didnt
think
there
would
be
as
many
bubbles
in
a
beer
that
felt
this
dense
but
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
superb
beer
with
a
lot
of
great
flavors
and
would
definitely
recommend
for
those
who
enjoy
german
or
belgium
styles
but
wanted
something
a
little
different
the
beer
is
an
amber
color
with
a
short
lasting
head
that
leaves
lacing
once
poured
the
first
smells
that
come
to
mind
are
of
other
banana
nut
bread
and
nutty
malt
a
very
pleasing
aroma
once
tasted
the
mouth
feel
was
excellent
with
a
medium
body
instantly
the
first
flavor
that
hits
you
is
banana
caramel
breading
malt
and
slight
hop
after
another
sip
the
hop
edges
its
way
in
more
but
compliments
the
other
flavors
rather
than
overpowers
them
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
great
weizenbock
and
can
compete
with
the
german
labels
will
buy
again
o
an
interesting
beer
at
a
good
price
if
wf
has
any
more
of
this
in
stock
next
time
im
there
i
would
pick
up
another
bottle
to
see
what
a
little
aging
does
to
this
beer
way
to
go
southern
tier
flavorful
tasty
odorous
and
chewy
impressed
with
this
un
o
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
there
were
many
elements
that
were
on
par
with
a
classic
weizenbock
such
as
the
light
caramel
flavors
and
papery
taste
along
with
some
of
the
fruity
esters
that
pop
in
and
out
to
me
it
seemed
a
lot
like
the
imported
varieties
that
i
can
buy
but
i
feel
that
it
is
hopped
a
bit
heavier
than
what
you
would
find
in
a
classic
weizenbock
this
is
obviously
just
how
i
perceive
it
but
it
seems
like
it
was
a
more
modern
interpretation
of
the
beer
without
sacrificing
its
heritage
its
a
good
beer
to
sit
back
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
contemplate
with
overall
this
was
a
rather
tasty
and
big
sweet
weizen

very
much
enjoyed
this
one

would
certainly
recommend
it

this
is
a

of

that
would
make
any
german
envious
great
beer
overall
and
will
have
it
again
quite
typical
of
american
brewers
making
classic
european
styles
the
taste
here
is
slightly
muted
lacking
the
complexity
or
depth
of
bavarian
versions
still
its
sugary
weight
supersedes
its
maltydry
finish
causing
the
beer
to
wear
on
the
palate
unnecessarily
the
banana
flavor
and
aroma
was
too
over
powering
even
though
i
really
enjoyed
the
way
the
beer
finished
as
well
as
the
way
it
drank
it
poured
really
nicely
almost
a
a
dark
caramel
color
with
a
great
head
but
again
all
i
smelt
was
banana
and
all
i
tasted
was
banana
which
isnt
my
thing
overall
im
impressed
with
this
one
not
a
style
that
many
brewers
tackle
and
southern
tier
does
it
justice
perhaps
it
is
not
as
well
rounded
as
the
german
variants
but
it
can
still
hold
a
candle
o
big
lager
with
some
interesting
flavors
and
some
off
flavors
sweet
and
sugary
brew
with
some
mineral
like
earthiness
to
it
o
a
damn
fine
weizenbock
this
is
one
of
my
fav
styles
and
rates
just
below
the
german
big
boys
for
me
i
will
def
be
picking
up
2
or
3
more
bottles
beautiful
beer
to
look
at
taste
great
pours
out
a
murky
brown
with
a
thin
head
smells
of
dark
caramel
malts
and
a
huge
punch
of
hefe
yeast
lots
of
banana
but
overwhelmingly
clovey
flavor
is
classic
weizenbock
banana
nut
bread
slight
booze
yeasty
esters
and
phenols
clove
is
the
strongest
player
here
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
and
a
bit
sticky
with
some
stinging
carbonation
awesome
example
of
a
weizenbock
hard
to
believe
this
was
made
in
the
us
the
primus
poured
a
an
opaque
deep
rich
amber
brown
with
a
huge
fluffy
tan
head
the
aroma
was
pure
bubblegum
banana
bliss
that
hit
all
the
perfect
hefeweizen
notes
along
with
the
spicy
yeast
and
slight
bits
of
sweet
pear
underneath
the
taste
was
sublime
and
the
mouthfeel
was
rich
and
creamy
and
all
that
i
want
in
a
weizenbock
the
bubblegum
and
banana
flavors
dominated
along
with
the
yeast
and
strong
hefeweizen
spice
notes
that
were
expertly
balanced
the
primus
has
to
be
on
of
the
best
weizenbocks
i
have
had
and
second
only
to
aventinus
although
it
is
a
weizen
doppelbock
and
my
favorite
live
oak
beer
this
rich
creamy
satisfying
brew
was
a
real
treat
and
something
to
look
forward
to
every
year
o
a
great
weizenbock
that
at
some
times
reminded
me
of
an
awesome
apple
pie
with
nice
sweet
and
baking
spice
notes
a
really
complex
beer
that
revealed
a
lot
of
different
layers
what
a
fun
enjoyable
beer
i
need
more
weizenbocks
in
my
life
thanks
for
the
unexpected
grumbler
kojevergas
o
yet
another
great
beer
from
live
oak
i
still
prefer
the
hefe
but
this
is
great
nonetheless
o
live
oaks
big
bark
was
one
of
my
first
craft
beer
love
affairs
and
this
brings
back
that
fondness
for
getting
me
started
on
good
beer
well
done
live
oak
you
do
texas
proud
overall
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
as
i
have
never
had
a
wizenbock
other
than
the
appearance
this
beer
was
very
very
good
another
home
run
by
live
oak
if
i
say
my
self
magically
delicious
i
have
ordered
this
3
times
now
at
alamo
drafthouse
even
though
usually
i
always
try
a
new
badass
beer
every
time
i
go
im
disappointed
that
i
cant
buy
it
in
bottles
and
thats
the
only
place
i
know
that
sells
it
all
i
can
say
is
if
you
know
a
place
to
get
this
go
imbibe
its
well
worth
it
good
luck
this
pours
a
murkycloudy
dark
brown
with
low
foam
a
bubblegummy
banana
aroma
thats
complemented
on
the
palate
its
tangy
malty
caramelly
sweet
with
a
banana
flavor
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
tangy
finishand
deceptive
at
8
abv
why
isnt
this
used
in
bbq
sauce
another
good
one
from
the
folks
at
live
oak
o
reminds
me
of
a
milder
version
of
aventinus
tastes
very
authentic
delicious
overall
ive
been
waiting
all
year
for
this
beer
and
it
absolutely
lives
up
to
expectations
hands
down
the
best
brew
available
on
the
market
until
its
retired
for
the
season
id
give
my
firstborn
child
if
live
oak
would
brew
this
year
round
overall
as
with
all
live
oak
beers
it
is
very
true
to
the
style
and
enjoyable
i
prefer
some
of
their
other
offerings
to
this
one
but
its
still
very
good
mouthfeel
is
sharp
with
a
fine
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
slightly
coating
with
each
sip
and
a
warm
clove
spice
and
toast
aftertaste
a
very
fresh
brew
with
a
robust
flavor
and
nice
layered
complexity
a
great
version
of
a
weizenbock
and
well
worth
seeking
out
d
an
absolutely
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
better
weizenbocks
ive
had
period
but
especially
from
a
us
brewery
had
an
8oz
glass
at
dinner
at
lamberts
in
austin
i
swear
its
very
hard
to
tell
this
apart
from
aventinus
the
only
obvious
difference
is
theres
an
odd
slightly
watery
element
to
the
mouthfeel
otherwise
theres
a
rich
blend
of
sweet
smooth
wheat
bread
with
caramel
and
dried
fruits
that
make
for
an
excellent
afterdinner
beer
try
this
out
there
are
certainly
few
americanmade
weizenbocks
that
can
match
this
strong
melanoidinrich
fruity
big
wheat
beer
perfect
to
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
night
while
imperfect
this
is
up
there
with
howling
wolf
weizenbock
on
my
list
of
great
domestic
examples
of
the
style
on
tap
at
my
favorite
austin
beer
haunt
the
draughthouse
all
nice
and
properly
filled
the
to
the
rim
with
a
murky
brown
brew
topped
by
a
tan
head
sweet
and
malty
to
the
nose
and
thats
about
all
i
gather
in
that
regard
tastes
big
and
sweet
up
front
with
a
nice
batch
of
grapes
bananas
some
nutmeg
some
cardomom
and
a
far
off
woodiness
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
big
and
sweet
but
not
cloying
with
just
enough
notes
of
balance
to
keep
you
singing
a
sweet
tune
in
the
live
music
capital
of
the
world
great
beer
especially
if
you
like
bananas
overall
this
was
one
of
the
best
of
my
trip
this
is
a
great
bock
and
very
drinkable
i
wanted
to
get
more
of
this
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
overall
i
have
to
admit
i
though
this
beer
was
a
dubbel
from
the
first
few
sips
however
as
it
warms
the
banana
asserts
itself
a
bit
more
worth
a
shot
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
a
great
seasonal
how
often
do
you
see
weizenbocks
around
if
they
were
all
like
this
the
answer
should
be
all
the
time
a
beer
lovers
beer
thanks
lo
d
at
8
this
beer
does
not
have
an
overpowering
alcohol
warming
to
it
but
it
does
posses
some
not
for
every
night
but
a
well
balanced
beer
that
would
be
perfect
in
winter
highly
recommended
to
any
wheat
beer
fan
who
can
get
his
hands
on
it
in
my
view
live
oak
is
the
best
wheat
beer
brewery
in
the
united
states
with
weyerbacher
new
glarus
and
penn
all
nipping
at
live
oaks
heels
nice
work
by
the
guys
in
austin
d
nice
easy
drinking
beer
wish
i
could
find
this
at
home
drinkability
another
impressive
release
from
the
live
oak
folks
really
like
the
subtle
elements
in
this
one
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
cream
colored
head
the
aroma
is
strong
bananas
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
bananas
wheat
and
cloves
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
nothing
too
complicated
or
fancy
just
a
very
well
executed
weizenbock
that
has
no
flaws
one
of
the
best
beers
of
this
style
i
have
tried
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
it
has
a
very
good
taste
making
it
so
i
could
drink
more
of
these
than
i
should
worth
getting
to
try
if
you
see
it
on
tap
d
the
one
glass
is
surprisingly
filling
the
flavor
is
strong
even
though
it
is
a
pleasant
flavor
one
glass
is
enough
for
me
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
had
this
on
tap
the
other
night
at
the
flying
saucer
in
ft
worth
it
was
a
real
dark
beer
dark
brownish
in
color
i
really
enjoyed
the
smells
it
gave
off
especially
for
a
dark
beer
very
fruity
smell
that
was
mostly
banana
it
tasted
great
too
it
was
very
hoppy
that
was
mixed
with
fruits
and
wasnt
filling
like
a
dark
beer
normally
is
i
thought
it
was
an
exceptional
beer
that
was
very
drinkable
i
even
had
a
second
my
girlfriend
also
loved
this
beer
and
she
isnt
a
fan
of
beer
at
all
several
of
these
scores
could
have
went
up
actually
nice
ruby
purplish
color
to
the
body
with
a
very
creamy
beige
head
lots
of
bananas
clove
and
wheat
grain
in
the
nose
the
flavors
come
together
nicely
in
this
one
score
could
have
been
higher
but
the
yeast
bite
was
a
little
sharp
great
wheat
bock
nice
and
fruity
and
dark
with
banana
clove
coriander
cherry
juice
and
candies
plums
mouthfeel
is
superb
as
i
am
finding
a
pattern
here
with
live
oaks
offerings
very
creamy
without
being
frothy
satisfying
well
carbonated
but
with
little
bubbles
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
for
such
a
dark
beer
note
after
having
the
beer
a
second
time
i
decided
that
the
look
isnt
that
bad
i
just
wasnt
used
to
it
all
having
been
unfamiliar
with
the
style
it
originally
looked
like
a
dirty
hefe
to
me
which
was
unappealing
lots
of
chocolate
in
the
flavor
with
a
prevalent
wheat
tang
bananas
and
cloves
are
still
there
but
might
be
a
little
less
prevalent
than
some
of
the
german
versions
its
also
a
tad
thinner
and
not
as
creamy
as
some
of
the
best
weizenbocks
maybe
it
is
not
quite
fair
to
expect
such
greatness
from
live
oak
as
their
hefeweizen
but
this
one
is
not
quite
up
to
that
standard
i
like
it
enough
and
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
especially
considering
the
lack
of
good
draft
weizenbocks
around
is
this
the
first
regularly
produced
texas
wb
if
so
its
a
good
start
d
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
could
have
drank
the
whole
growler
on
my
own
without
a
problem
another
winner
from
live
oak
would
love
to
see
this
one
in
bottles
deep
dark
brown
minimal
head
but
its
a
clinger
nice
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
pint
glass
roasty
wheat
and
peppery
smoke
throughout
the
nose
and
very
strong
in
the
mouth
to
me
its
not
the
most
pleasant
taste
but
i
do
think
it
fits
the
weizenbock
style
goes
down
relatively
smooth
and
hides
the
8
pretty
well
i
didnt
try
to
drink
more
than
one
as
i
didnt
particularly
dig
it
but
it
is
what
it
is
and
i
would
encourage
you
to
try
it
if
you
find
yourself
in
texas
especially
if
you
are
a
weizenbock
fan
this
doesnt
taste
all
that
far
off
aventinus
d
i
really
only
wanted
one
of
the
22oz
of
these
even
though
the
taste
was
off
the
charts
good
for
me
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
and
hope
i
get
the
opportunity
to
do
so
it
was
somewhat
heavy
which
is
what
prevented
me
from
drinking
multiples
of
this
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
gingerman
in
houston
the
beer
was
dark
brown
and
hazy
with
a
thick
offwhite
foam
that
lasted
forever
there
was
a
strong
aroma
of
bananas
cloves
rich
and
delicious
honestly
this
smelled
like
aventinus
same
with
the
taste
the
essence
of
aventinus
right
down
to
the
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
and
hint
of
lactose
live
oak
seems
on
a
mission
to
replicate
the
best
german
beers
ive
been
very
pleased
with
the
several
ive
tried
hefeweizen
primus
oaktoberfest
the
flavor
is
just
as
complex
as
the
aroma
starting
with
sweeter
notes
of
dark
bread
and
banananut
muffins
finishes
strong
with
a
smooth
boozy
warmth
that
balances
nicely
alongside
earthen
notes
of
wood
and
peat
nearperfect
body
to
this
brew
with
its
creamy
mediumthick
consistency
and
gentle
carbonation
level
with
their
phenomenal
hefeweizen
impressive
pilsner
and
a
newly
added
weizenbock
to
their
repertoire
liveoak
seems
intent
on
recreating
the
german
beer
experience
here
in
texas
and
for
that
i
couldnt
be
happier
overall
a
really
great
beer
excellent
weizenbock
from
live
oak
notes
an
excellent
wezendopplebock
i
get
one
whenever
im
somewhere
that
has
it
on
draft
drinkability
well
that
was
pretty
tasty
and
a
downright
joy
to
drink
wheat
sic
else
could
you
want
from
a
weizenbock
overall
another
dang
good
beer
from
live
oak
an
extremely
solid
beer
i
thought
the
mild
roasty
characters
added
a
lot
solid
poured
beautifully
murky
with
lasting
lacing
throughout
wheaty
aromas
fruit
bananas
delicious
banana
and
clove
flavor
luscious
mouthfeel
smooth
i
am
pretty
close
to
saying
this
is
live
oaks
best
beer
almost
we
will
keep
the
hefeweizen
there
excellent
highly
recommended
pours
a
dark
red
brown
color
body
smallish
head
creamy
and
tan
very
strong
ripe
aroma
some
spiciness
almost
all
bananas
creamy
softly
carbonated
palate
a
nice
fruit
cocktail
and
banana
taste
strong
banana
taste
like
in
the
nose
this
is
my
first
live
oak
beer
and
i
was
impressed
it
was
probably
a
tad
sweet
for
me
but
its
still
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
had
never
heard
of
this
offering
prior
to
last
night
but
decided
to
try
it
based
on
live
oaks
track
record
of
making
great
brews
boy
am
i
glad
i
did
i
would
highly
recommend
this
offering
especially
if
youre
fond
of
the
hefeweizen
live
oak
makes
one
of
the
best
weizenbocks
ive
had
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
a
great
representation
of
the
style
however
the
richness
of
it
would
make
it
difficult
to
have
more
than
a
couple
once
again
the
guys
at
live
oak
have
shown
their
ability
emulate
the
finest
styles
of
german
beers
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
weizenbock
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
something
i
look
forward
to
every
year
just
not
among
my
favorites
of
this
particularly
great
brewery
d
low
for
me
but
i
hope
some
weizenbock
or
dunkel
lovers
review
for
comparison
pours
golden
with
an
orange
blush
hazy
with
a
frothy
foamy
head
of
creamy
white
foam
that
lasted
matte
appearance
no
shine
or
glow
to
this
beer
nose
is
wheat
brought
to
richness
toasty
bread
crust
and
a
bit
of
clove
light
banana
and
a
creamy
but
crisp
wheat
flavor
slight
warming
in
the
finish
finishes
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
for
balance
and
so
that
the
malt
can
reside
splendidly
in
the
after
taste
with
some
dark
fruits
and
bread
crust
solid
take
on
the
style
plenty
of
sweet
fruity
esters
to
go
around
highly
drinkable
and
the
abv
is
barely
noticeable
a
must
try
for
fans
of
the
weizenbock
well
done
ayinger
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
this
beer
was
trash
baud
swirling
the
last
14
of
the
bottle
to
rouse
the
yeast
created
a
super
cloudy
appearance
and
made
it
even
spicier
a
solid
weizenbock
that
would
make
for
a
nice
treat
once
in
a
while
but
not
something
im
grabbing
for
everyday
smooth
mouthfeel
some
hint
of
alcohol
medium
full
body
medium
high
carbonation
very
fine
and
soft
creamy
o
really
good
and
a
great
way
to
get
a
bit
more
abv
out
of
hefeweizen
honestly
the
only
thing
different
from
standard
hefe
here
is
the
extra
13
abv
and
that
belgian
witbier
spice
other
than
that
its
good
banana
hefeweizen
overall
just
a
wonderful
brew
cloudy
golden
appearance
with
two
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
huge
bananas
and
cloves
with
i
slight
hint
of
bubblegum
taste
is
bananas
cloves
and
just
a
minor
bit
of
citrus
tartness
mouthfeel
is
just
outstanding
fairly
light
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
that
complements
the
flavor
this
beer
is
comparable
to
vitus
and
unser
aventinus
in
every
way
simply
wonderful
overall
a
nice
weizenbock
but
there
are
a
few
better
this
is
an
excellent
pale
weizenbock
dont
pass
this
up
if
you
even
remotely
enjoy
wheat
beers
this
is
a
strong
offering
from
one
of
my
preferred
bavarian
breweries
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
higher
abv
which
could
prove
to
be
dangerous
prost
this
beer
was
a
surprisingly
delightful
experience
i
poured
the
cloudy
livelycolored
brew
into
a
glass
and
was
converted
into
a
weizenbock
fanatic
instantly
ive
tried
a
fair
few
now
but
i
think
this
is
quite
possibly
my
favorite
aventinus
is
another
great
one
but
it
doesnt
have
the
same
refreshing
quality
vitus
is
great
also
but
not
as
cloudy
and
substantial
i
should
add
that
i
had
this
beer
after
a
long
day
working
outside
my
thirst
and
desire
for
a
cold
refreshing
beverage
may
have
something
to
do
with
my
decision
to
award
this
brew
a
near
perfect
5
overall
i
really
like
this
one

a

offering
a
wonderful
brew
while
it
is
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
schneider
weisse
tap
6
is
but
it
is
still
a
substantial
and
tasty
bigger
brother
of
the
hefeweizen
overall
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
imperial
hefeweizen
this
is
it
all
the
notes
of
a
traditional
hefeweizen
are
emphasized
and
made
bigger
in
this
brew
in
traditional
weizenbock
fashion
this
beer
sneaks
up
on
you
since
it
tastes
so
simple
much
like
what
you
would
find
in
a
hefeweizen
but
a
bit
sweeter
it
lulls
you
into
a
false
sense
of
security
only
after
this
point
do
you
start
feeling
the
alcohol
a
bit
fantastic
beer
very
very
different
from
aventinus
another
popular
weizenbock
looking
forward
to
comparing
it
to
weihenstephaner
vitus
soon
there
is
no
bitter
taste
im
one
of
those
people
who
hates
bitter
hoppy
beers
i
just
cant
understand
why
people
pretend
to
like
those
beers
haha
the
human
body
has
evolved
to
dislike
bitter
things
hence
why
we
hardly
eat
anything
that
is
bitter
fact
this
beer
is
on
the
opposite
spectrum
of
the
beer
world
this
is
a
malty
beer
so
have
no
fear
people
with
tastebuds
this
actually
tastes
pleasant
you
dont
have
to
pretend
to
like
this
you
just
will
o
though
shockingly
lighter
than
most
weizenbock
beers
ayinger
weizenbock
features
all
the
same
characteristics
and
blends
them
fabulously
spice
forward
this
beer
has
yeast
incorporated
through
every
aspect
of
it
from
the
aroma
and
flavor
to
finish
creamy
smooth
its
like
fresh
moist
banana
bread
without
any
nuts
filling
the
stomach
providing
sustenance
overall
i
really
love
this
beer
there
is
a
real
richness
from
the
aroma
and
flavor
along
with
very
wellhidden
alcohol
one
to
work
into
the
regular
rotation

with

clove
fruity
sweetness
and
spices
mild
bitterness
and
the
finish
is
a

smooth
and
flavorful
a
well

beer
with
no

of
the

enjoyable
beer
from
a
quality
german
brewery
pours
a
little
cloudy
yellow
with
rockin
white

smells
of
bubblegum
with
supportive
banana
and
a
touch
of
clove
tastes
of
sweet
cotton
candy
with
doughy
wheat
undertones
mostly
sweet

with

pairs
excellent
with
a

ayingers
doppelbock
gets
the
lions
share
of
the
attention
from
this
brewery
but
this
stuff
is
easily
as
good
for
its
style
i
would
think
that
this
one
would
be
an
even
better
crowd
pleaser
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
when
confronted
with
someone
who
says
i
dont
like
beer
i
would
have
himher
try
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
id
have
to
have
a
pretty
specific
beer
craving
in
order
to
not
want
to
drink
this
beer
the
ayinger
weizenbock
poured
an
opaque
straw
color
with
plenty
of
head
the
bubble
gum
and
clove
nose
was
immediately
apparent
and
the
first
taste
was
heavy
on
the
signature
hefeweisen
flavors
it
had
a
wonderfully
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
i
love
a
good
weizenbock
and
the
ayinger
version
was
heavy
on
those
classic
hefeweisen
flavors
and
just
plain
excellent
o
very
solid
clean
and
refreshing
with
more
grain
than
other
weizenbocks
not
quite
as
well
integrated
as
vitus
or
some
others
overall
what
a
great
beer
i
was
kind
of
worried
about
this
one
the
last
few
beers
ive
had
along
these
lines
were
not
so
impressive
but
here
we
have
a
clean
tasty
and
aromatic
delight
wonderful
odelicious
summer
beer
for
a
hot
day
great
flavors
o
this
is
a
very
flavorful
hefeweizenbock
there
is
a
lot
of
sweetness
throughout
but
not
overly
so
the
huge
banana
and
clove
notes
really
make
this
beer
shine
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
fresh
given
how
good
it
is
as
an
import
its
the
type
of
beer
where
you
have
to
hunt
for
any
negatives
because
they
are
not
readily
apparent
even
after
hunting
there
are
precious
few
to
focus
on
overallmore
of
a
hefeweizen
with
attitude
than
a
bock
but
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
pepper
and
clove
with
hints
of
lemon
honey
and
light
sugar
the
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
with
lots
of
yeasty
phenols
that
get
in
the
way
of
me
enjoying
this
beer
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
mouthfeel
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
o
yet
another
fantastic
beer
from
brauerei
aying
this
must
be
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
entire
world
if
you
find
a
beer
from
aying
that
you
havnt
sampled
be
advised
try
it
youll
like
it
o
cpled
and
balanced
with
flavors
that
work
very
nicely
together
this
is
impeccable
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
its
a
concentrated
burst
of
sweet
bavarian
wheat
beer
flavor
pale
weizenbocks
seem
to
be
a
delicate
thing
and
have
a
tendency
to
stray
into
boozy
territory
but
aying
is
clearly
too
good
of
a
brewery
to
go
down
that
road
this
is
a
very
likable
beer
and
its
hard
not
to
smile
with
each
sip
overall
this
is
more
wheat
beer
than
bock
it
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
so
good
it
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
as
it
smells
but
somehow
even
better
with
each
swish
in
your
mouth
you
find
tiny
explosions
of
orange
then
some
other
fruit
then
banana
all
having
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
the
drink
feels
excellent
in
your
mouth
only
positive
things
can
be
said
of
this
delicious
brew
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
once
again
i
love
the
new
design
on
the
label
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
a
very
easy
drinker
as
well
and
at
7
1
abv
a
couple
of
these
could
really
do
you
in
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
you
dont
watch
it
o
this
beer
tastes
old
tired
musty
stale
and
overall
an
unappetizing
weizenbock
which
is
a
shame
because
this
a
beer
style
that
should
shine
from
bavaria
could
it
be
an
old
bottle
its
possible
yet
i
dont
think
it
would
have
been
this
detrimental
to
its
flavor
and
aroma
aventinus
is
leaps
and
bounds
better
as
is
the
americanized
version
from
victory
moon
glow
which
is
pretty
damn
amazing
ive
never
known
ayinger
to
make
a
beer
that
wasnt
enjoyable
this
one
is
no
exception
ive
only
been
able
to
find
one
other
german
weizenbock
stateside
which
was
brewed
by
schneider
son
the
makers
of
the
aventinus
this
beer
carries
the
ayinger
quality
the
taste
is
incredibly
well
balanced
combining
the
bittersweet
wheat
flavors
with
the
bubblegum
and
malt
flavors
effortlessly
it
pours
a
murky
amber
and
smells
like
most
weizen
beers
would
this
beer
is
a
good
spring
or
summer
beer
and
id
recommend
it
to
any
lover
of
wheat
beers
not
my
favorite
of
the
weizenbocks
ive
had
i
prefer
less
weizen
and
more
bock
but
still
an
awfully
nice
beer
perfect
on
a
sunday
afternoon
while
relaxing
or
taking
a
break
from
yardwork
o
not
as
malty
as
the
others
on
the
market
but
that
makes
it
sort
of
interesting
not
one
of
ayingers
better
brews
but
still
a
respectable
effort
edit
as
it
warmed
a
lot
more
emerged
like
a
little
toffee
and
a
hint
of
heat
t
rich
wheat
and
banana
with
a
big
bready
malt
backbone
the
carbonation
holds
up
the
flavors
perfectly
i
freaking
love
ayinger
i
didnt
feel
like
this
was
as
amazing
as
their
regular
hefe
i
guess
im
partial
to
the
darker
weizenbocks
this
still
disappeared
quite
fast
o
a
very
very
good
weizenbock
i
tend
to
enjoy
the
helleslight
weizenbocks
more
than
the
dunkelsdarker
offerings
probably
the
2nd
best
weizenbock
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
experiencing
its
a
great
style
and
aying
did
it
right
there
should
never
be
a
discussion
about
the
best
of
germany
without
brauerei
aying
being
mentioned
they
just
deliver
world
class
german
ales
on
a
regular
basis
i
say
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
like
german
wheat
beers
i
could
enjoy
something
like
this
any
time
of
the
year
overall
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
when
comparing
to
its
style
it
is
a
very
good
beer
pours
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
moderate
head
huge
pleasant
aroma
of
banana
pear
cloves
and
peaches
taste
is
sweet
fruity
and
delicious
similar
to
the
ayinger
urweisse
multiplied
by
2
thankfully
all
of
the
ayinger
beers
are
easy
to
find
in
the
area
for
which
i
am
extremely
grateful
for
me
they
are
the
gold
standard
of
bavarian
beers
although
i
have
never
travelled
abroad
i
have
consumed
several
cases
of
the
weizenbock
and
urweisse
and
have
never
been
disappointed
regardless
of
what
i
am
eating
drinking
or
feeling
they
are
truly
miraculous
in
this
respect
always
enjoyable
o
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
darker
and
heaver
but
this
is
so
drinkable
and
smooth
im
not
complaining
i
initially
had
just
over
a
finger
of
french
vanillacolored
head
but
it
quickly
fell
to
mere
wisps
color
was
a
cloudy
yellowishorange
nose
had
a
fruitiness
like
juicy
fruit
gum
and
i
was
becoming
intrigued
i
do
not
remember
the
last
time
i
drank
a
weizenbock
but
ayinger
is
always
a
solid
choice
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
fruity
sweetness
made
for
an
easy
drink
too
easy
as
i
was
through
over
half
the
glass
before
i
realized
it
at
that
rate
i
will
be
as
drunk
as
the
goat
who
is
toasting
me
from
the
label
the
finish
was
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
as
it
warmed
i
began
to
get
some
alcohol
heat
coming
through
in
fact
as
it
warmed
the
mouthfeel
became
fuller
not
creamy
but
big
and
full
on
the
tongue
note
to
self
and
others
allow
this
to
warm
slightly
before
consuming
overall
a
good
beer
not
the
best
of
the
style
though
to
me
this
comes
across
tastes
like
a
curious
hybrid
of
the
hefeweizen
and
weizenbock
styles
fringe
doesnt
have
what
i
envision
as
the
classic
weizenbock
flavor
but
quite
tasty
all
the
same
stupideasy
to
drink
overall
drinkability
i
was
quite
disappointed
with
this
still
not
a
bad
brew
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
even
though
there
is
a
relatively
high
abv
because
it
is
very
well
hidden
very
tasty
and
very
refreshing
o
another
fine
offering
from
ayinger
an
outstanding
beer
that
satisfies
i
could
drink
several
at
a
time
and
be
a
happy
person
pours
a
pale
golden
with
a
slight
glow
to
it
and
a
head
that
is
pure
white
and
fades
somewhat
quickly
to
a
thin
ring
honeyed
aromas
are
very
pleasant
and
set
the
stage
for
the
even
more
appealing
taste
nice
notes
of
honey
bananas
stone
fruit
and
a
just
a
touch
of
spice
with
some
breadiness
on
the
finish
slightly
sweet
but
wholly
appropriate
for
the
style
very
smooth
and
just
a
pleasure
all
around
very
nice
and
refreshing
tastes
a
lot
lighter
than
it
is
definitely
another
winner
from
ayinger
a
great
example
of
quality
beer
o
may
not
be
the
most
complex
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
but
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
be
happy
to
buy
again
at
3bottle
bursting
with
tons
of
flavor
bready
cloves
banana
bubble
gum
orange
spice
peppery
caramel
crisp
smooth
finish
full
bodied
milk
shake
texture
soft
carbonation
o
like
a
big
brother
to
a
hefeweizen
this
beer
stayed
clear
of
any
caramelyroasted
malts
like
you
are
likely
to
find
in
a
dunkel
modest
on
alcohol
very
drinkable
deceiving
phase
1
complete
phase
2
on
the
pour
overall
fairly
similar
to
their
other
wheat
brews
particularly
the
dunkelweizen
though
this
ones
a
bit
sweeter
hard
to
believe
this
has
about
the
same
abv
as
arrogant
bastard
virtually
no
trace
of
alcohol
in
this
well
executed
brew
not
especially
complex
but
it
is
insanely
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
well
crafted
and
hides
the
7
1
extremely
well
very
nice
o
very
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
almost
cider
like
definitely
will
pick
this
up
again
well
it
just
doesnt
get
better
than
this
deep
complex
and
refreshing
how
so
never
seen
this
one
available
to
me
before
so
very
glad
i
grabbed
one
o
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
that
is
well
worth
grabbing
a
delicious
full
flavored
weizenbock
super
yummy
and
so
glad
i
was
able
to
take
it
for
a
spin
thanks
joe
possibly
the
yeastiest
beer
i
have
ever
had
an
amped
up
sweet
hefeweizen
very
good
beer
and
definitely
something
id
have
again
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
golden
orange
and
very
hazy
it
had
tons
and
tons
of
head
that
dissipated
very
slowly
with
no
lacing
the
nose
was
banana
citrus
peel
and
more
alcohol
than
i
would
have
expected
af
first
the
flavor
was
very
banana
fruity
almost
sour
i
let
it
breathe
a
little
and
it
mellowed
to
a
delicious
banana
and
yeasty
bread
let
it
breathe
for
sure
big
mouthfeel
with
avg
carbonation
tasty
and
smooth
give
it
time
to
open
up
and
its
great
overall
a
delicious
easytodrink
beer
i
cannot
believe
this
thing
has
7
abv
o
a
little
different
from
what
i
expect
from
a
weizenbock
but
tasty
nothing
mind
blowing
just
good
solid
beer
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
fine
example
of
a
traditional
german
weixenbock
it
pretty
much
had
all
the
nice
features
that
i
look
for
in
this
style
and
they
all
come
together
nicely
this
beer
had
really
good
drinkability
it
went
down
really
smooth
was
refreshing
and
flavors
held
my
attention
i
drank
this
faster
then
i
thought
and
i
think
two
or
three
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
would
be
perfect
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
how
drinkable
it
was
and
how
great
the
mouthfeel
was
they
were
both
better
then
i
was
expecting
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
price
its
a
little
on
the
steep
side
if
this
brew
was
a
little
cheaper
it
would
stay
in
my
fridge
all
summer
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
good
and
very
drinkable
weizenbock
i
highly
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
ayinger
has
proved
to
be
one
solid
brewery
all
the
beers
i
have
had
from
them
have
been
nothing
less
then
good
and
it
seems
like
they
have
the
traditional
german
styles
dialed
in
while
heavy
seas
hang
ten
is
still
the
best
one
i
have
reviewed
i
would
say
that
this
one
is
slightly
better
then
vitus
and
it
now
takes
the
place
as
my
favorite
german
weixenbock
good
job
guys
keep
shipping
your
great
beer
to
the
usa
and
ill
keep
drinking
it
overall
solid
stuff
i
know
its
an
ayinger
product
but
damn
this
was
super
tasty
im
going
to
say
better
than
vitus
but
continues
to
confirm
my
opinion
that
aventinus
is
the
best
weizenbock
overall
another
nice
beer
from
ayinger
and
while
the
malty
bock
character
is
appropriate
to
this
example
it
is
not
my
favorite
element
in
the
world
of
weizens
awesome
beer
ayinger
makes
a
lot
of
em
an
incredible
weizenbock

a
cloudy
brown
amber
on
the
pour
with
a
large
lasting
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
yeast
banana
and
fruity
esters
taste
is
sweet
malt
banana
fruity
yeast
wheat
with
some
sweet
tart
notes
a
medium

with
soft

on
the

finish
is
sweet
caramel
malt
yeast
some
banana
and
fruity
flavors
wheat
ending
has
some
light
bitterness
for
balance
overall
a
very
good
tasty
and
flavorful
brew
a
solid
all
around
ale
o
very
tasty
beer
a
bit
of
a
meal
in
a
glass
but
nothing
wrong
with
that
a
bit
more
weizen
than
bock
but
very
tasty
overall
drinkability
i
wonder
how
this
beer
would
have
been
had
i
given
it
a
more
careful
pour
and
left
all
the
sediment
in
still
a
good
combination
of
a
hefeweizen
and
a
bock
beer
quite
drinkable
i
would
not
mind
cracking
open
another
bottle
and
continue
to
savor
this
beer
it
smells
like
it
should
and
it
is
obvious
this
is
a
european
product
but
once
is
enough
for
me
try
it
if
you
want
to
do
a
unique
wheat
beer
overall
an
amped
up
hefeweizen
rather
than
a
weizenbock
i
would
expect
some
deep
toasted
malt
flavors
and
melanoidins
to
accompany
the
hefeweizen
profile
still
a
well
made
and
tasty
beer
pours
a
murky
honey
gold
with
a
2
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
chunks
of
lace
slowly
slide
down
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
yeast
spices
and
some
pepperlike
aromas
there
is
a
slight
fruity
note
that
i
am
getting
more
as
the
beer
warms
as
well
taste
is
quite
sweet
and
is
of
wheat
banana
yeast
and
some
very
nice
spice
flavors
in
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
lightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
o
perfect
beer
for
a
warm
spring
night
tons
of
fruity
banana
and
spice
excellent
carbonation
id
like
to
try
this
with
a
14
shot
of
spiced
rum
this
is
my
first
real
written
review
using
astmo
so
the
descriptions
and
words
are
not
flowing
from
me
yet
o
a
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
offering
that
echos
the
virtues
of
the
german
purity
law
a
must
try
a
wheat
bock
ale
with
a
fluffy
head
light
bodied
and
tastes
as
good
as
it
looks
sit
back
relax
and
indulge
on
a
smooth
fruity
splash
of
malts
a
bit
of
frothy
carbonation
a
tang
of
yeast
and
what
most
like
to
saybanana
sweetness
excellent
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
and
probably
the
best
wheat
bocks
that
ive
ever
laid
my
palate
to
overall
not
too
bad
refreshing
a
little
soda
pop
like
though
for
my
tastes
o
up
there
with
the
best
wheat
beers
ive
ever
tasted
this
is
a
special
beer
that
everyone
should
enjoy
cheers
a
very
fine
beer
to
me
it
stayed
more
true
to
a
hefeweizen
flavor
with
just
added
sweetness
whilst
other
examples
of
weizenbock
ive
tried
were
a
bit
different
recommended
o
though
meant
for
winter
this
beer
is
not
too
heavy
it
is
worth
sipping
though
it
has
lots
of
great
fruit
and
spice
flavor
that
is
balanced
very
well
very
solid
very
classic
beer
pours
a
pale
goldenorange
color
with
a
nice
bit
of
foamy
head
a
bit
of
yeast
stayed
behind
in
the
bottle
smelled
of
citrus
and
banana
very
appealing
excellent
crisp
taste
a
lot
of
the
same
notes
from
the
aroma
come
through
in
the
beer
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
as
well
nice
crisp
finish
that
makes
you
want
to
go
back
for
more
pours
a
pale
orange
with
a
twofinger
long
lasting
cloudy
white
head
aroma
of
yeast
spices
banana
and
orange
peel
very
balanced
and
tasty
flavor
starts
with
strong
orange
peel
notes
as
well
with
some
clove
wheat
and
spicy
yeast
flavors
in
the
background
nice
sweet
banana
flavor
is
next
which
transitions
nicely
into
the
sweeter
flavors
of
the
beer
sweet
sticky
bread
and
caramel
malt
to
a
lesser
extent
mesh
perfectly
with
the
banana
notes
to
close
this
one
out
lingers
very
nicely
well
after
the
finish
classic
german
flavors
o
very
smooth
and
drinkable
ayinger
quality
imho
one
of
the
best
german
breweries
a
great
beer
im
beginning
to
find
i
have
quite
a
fondness
for
weizenbocks
and
this
is
another
good
one
a
delicious
weizenbock
not
really
that
unexpected
from
ayinger
as
this
is
yet
another
excellent
offering
from
them
poured
from
a
550
ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
unknown
freshness
date
this
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
color
with
a
massive
white
head
the
smells
are
good
wheat
belgian
yeast
esters
banana
and
other
fruit
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
high
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
good
wheat
very
light
hops
some
sweetness
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
tastes
like
it
smells
only
the
wheats
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
bock
nice
blend
though
white
pepper
moves
into
banana
esters
and
then
the
back
end
in
a
delicious
blend
of
chewy
yeast
and
tangy
bock
malt
o
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
sweetness
wears
on
me
a
tad
as
i
progress
through
the
beer
otherwise
it
strikes
me
as
a
unique
twist
on
the
classic
hefe
and
along
with
its
stupid
drinkablilty
factor
makes
it
one
thats
well
worth
diving
into
overall
solid
brew
quite
a
tasty
weizenbock
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
the
best
offering
i
have
had
to
date
smooth
lightly
creamy
a
great
beer
one
to
sit
and
enjoy
one
a
winter
night
well
this
is
a
pretty
quintessential
weizenbock
and
a
musttry
for
any
aventinus
drinkers
out
there
happened
to
get
this
on
a
pretty
big
sale
3
making
it
as
cheap
or
cheaper
than
weihenstephaners
5l
bottles
in
the
style
value
for
money
still
probably
goes
to
victory
moonglow
but
likely
because
theyre
domestic
its
getting
a
high
rating
but
i
just
cant
fault
it
this
is
one
amazing
wheat
complex
delicious
wonderfull
the
carbonation
is
fairly
prickly
and
the
mouthfeel
on
the
week
side
overall
it
just
doesnt
do
much
for
me
o
fantastic
beer
and
another
winner
from
ayinger
7
1
hides
very
well
in
this
beer
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
love
it
its
my
reach
to
beer
even
with
the
7
1abv
i
think
the
sticky
sweetness
would
prevent
me
from
having
more
than
2
at
a
time
someone
said
its
a
hefe
weizen
on
steroids
and
i
have
to
agree
a
hefe
on
steroids
and
just
perfect
for
this
chilly
evening
the
price
is
right
and
this
may
be
in
my
regular
line
up
for
a
couple
months
o
nicely
crafted
beer
ive
had
some
bad
weizenbocks
in
the
past
that
have
not
been
that
good
most
are
darker
i
like
the
light
and
refreshing
quality
of
this
beer
its
almost
like
an
imperial
hefe
very
nice
onot
bad
more
clovey
than
i
prefer
my
weizenbocks
but
a
solid
version
of
the
style
very
drinkable
o
as
a
weizenbock
it
doesnt
compete
with
aventinus
in
complexity
and
character
just
seems
a
little
lacking
yet
a
terrific
weizen
for
anyone
to
try
one
of
the
toptier
examples
of
the
style
though
it
lacks
some
punchdepthintensity
compared
to
aventinus
or
maybe
even
vitus
the
latter
having
a
somewhat
similar
flavor
profile
one
of
the
most
sensational
beers
i
have
ever
tried
i
certainly
do
have
a
fondness
for
heffeweizens
tripels
etc
so
i
am
making
that
my
disclaimer
here
before
my
review
i
could
literally
drink
this
beer
forever
and
not
get
tired
of
it
smells
like
delicious
wheat
banana
hint
of
clove
and
citrus
all
perfectly
balanced
nice
solid
2
finger
head
that
dissipates
within
2
minutes
very
nice
white
head
with
a
hint
of
yellow
around
the
edges
tastes
delicious
full
thick
wheaty
taste
with
lots
of
banana
and
smooth
as
a
babys
bottom
clean
and
crisp
from
start
to
finish
no
hint
of
alcohol
no
burn
or
heat
emanating
at
any
point
during
a
sip
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
coming
back
and
as
my
amateur
palate
develops
i
will
continue
to
drink
this
beer
to
continue
to
explore
all
of
its
mystique
and
beauty
wow
yet
another
awesome
tasty
brew
by
ayinger
fruitier
than
ayingers
hefeweissen
and
slightly
heavier
as
youd
expect
with
a
bock
drinking
this
is
like
drinking
beer
nectar
delicious
overall
i
bought
the
pint
bottle
and
had
heard
great
things
about
ayinger
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
very
delicious
but
slightly
more
sweetness
than
i
prefer
but
it
didnt
take
away
from
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
murky
straworange
color
white
head
made
up
of
tiny
bubbles
surprising
low
head
retention
considering
the
wheat
it
could
be
the
notable
alcohol
content
yeasty
in
smell
i
actually
dont
find
the
aroma
appealing
my
first
impression
was
offputting
mold
smell
thankfully
it
tastes
much
better
than
it
smells
wide
spectrum
of
flavors
dark
malted
wheat
flavor
into
clean
yeast
and
a
slight
acidic
ending
nice
caramel
aftertaste
clean
flavor
really
isolates
and
accentuates
the
malted
wheat
flavor
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
enhances
the
smooth
quality
pretty
unique
and
tasty
beer
ayinger
has
yet
to
disappoint
o
a
pretty
good
weizenbock
this
one
was
quite
a
bit
sweeter
than
any
of
the
weizenbocks
i
have
had
a
little
too
sweet
definitely
not
a
beer
to
drink
by
the
liter
if
you
intend
on
drawing
out
the
fun
all
night
long
overall
ill
get
this
again
a
wonderful
beer
i
think
that
aventinus
is
better
overall
for
a
german
weizenbock
thats
easy
to
get
but
this
is
no
slotch
this
is
a
tasty
fruity
estery
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
sweet
and
a
bit
boozy
certainly
a
beer
not
t
be
missed
it
poured
a
hazy
yellow
color
beer
with
a
large
white
head
which
dissipated
quickly
it
smelled
of
wheat
yeast
straw
malt
it
tasted
of
wheat
yeast
slight
nutmeg
bread
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
fullbodied
overall
this
is
a
top
10
german
beer
finally
a
fantastic
tasting
beer
it
just
warms
in
your
mouth
like
a
spoon
full
of
french
onion
soup
yum
give
me
another
o
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
reminded
me
more
of
a
hefeweizen
check
it
out
if
you
havnt
anything
ayinger
makes
is
pretty
good
medium
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
for
the
style
i
have
had
thicker
but
i
think
this
is
more
drinkable
with
the
body
as
it
is
overall
job
very
well
done
d
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
several
pints
of
this
the
alcohol
is
concealed
dangerously
well
d
not
bad
this
is
a
logical
extension
of
the
intense
yeast
character
of
ayingers
lower
alcohol
wheat
beers
there
is
a
dense
malt
note
that
is
present
throughout
but
i
really
would
have
expected
it
to
be
darker
with
some
caramel
and
toasted
notes
i
guess
it
is
a
helles
weizen
bock
drinkable
enough
but
i
would
definitely
take
their
brauweisse
or
urweisse
over
this
one
finishes
very
light
with
a
creamy
body
crisp
rather
than
hot
alcohol
on
the
tongue
a
drinkable
weizenbock
final
thoughts
for
a
hefeweizen
it
would
be
absolutely
amazing
but
i
terms
of
weizenbocks
that
ive
had
to
this
point
its
second
only
to
aventinus
hey
but
wait
it
only
lost
to
the
best
beer
in
my
opinion
if
you
can
get
this
beer
do
it
o
very
good
brew
i
like
the
style
the
wheat
adds
some
smoothness
and
nice
sweet
notes
to
an
already
malty
brew
very
nice
beer
creamy
and
decadent
on
the
palate
not
big
on
the
bock
aspect
but
more
like
an
imperial
hefe
but
oh
so
delicious
bubblegum
and
clove
at
the
forefront
middle
and
through
the
finish
banana
flavors
linger
on
the
finish
as
well
a
bit
bready
with
light
toffee
flavors
yeasty
throughout
light
raisin
quality
deep
in
the
finish
that
peeks
out
after
a
few
sips
low
a
i
like
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
more
exceptional
than
their
regular
weissbier
and
really
just
more
alcoholic
than
complex
though
of
course
the
increased
alcohol
leads
to
a
slight
increase
in
complex
character
ill
probably
just
go
with
the
ayinger
brauweiss
over
this
but
who
can
say
for
sure
after
all
ive
made
impulsive
buying
decisions
before
and
will
do
so
again
from
the
25
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
june
9
2011
it
pours
a
bubbly
but
hazy
starw
yellow
with
an
incredible
head
that
is
topped
off
with
a
silky
delicate
frostinglike
cap
the
aroma
is
full
of
yeast
and
wheat
with
a
little
banana
characteristic
the
body
is
comfortbale
on
the
tongue
and
does
not
break
down
into
a
fizz
in
the
taste
there
is
a
lively
combination
of
traditional
german
malts
a
bhiunt
of
wheat
a
bite
of
clove
and
a
tangy
tart
end
o
this
has
great
drinkability
it
goes
down
smooth
and
i
love
the
flavor
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
good
beer
the
flavor
is
great
i
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
some
more
plenty
sweet
punctuated
and
contextualized
by
meaningful
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
still
a
little
springy
take
a
look
at
the
label
art
and
notice
our
friend
the
german
billy
goat
bock
has
a
pair
quite
appropriate
since
this
ayinger
weizenbock
definitely
has
a
pair
too
i
would
never
get
bored
drinking
this
beer
this
is
a
perfect
complement
to
a
hot
florida
day
theres
a
mix
of
berry
candy
and
mild
banana
with
soft
wheat
bread
in
the
background
that
said
theres
that
backing
malt
is
rich
and
full
giving
this
a
heavier
body
but
an
appropriate
weight
for
the
style
so
if
you
love
hefes
and
want
to
see
and
taste
what
they
can
be
amped
up
this
is
exactly
that
all
the
same
rich
yeast
character
and
smooth
malt
nothing
wows
me
with
this
helles
weizenbock
its
just
a
solid
brew
very
drinkable
fantastic
and
while
its
many
months
old
i
dont
have
many
complaints
pours
a
very
cloudy
light
golden
color
with
a
dense
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
a
thick
collar
throughout
the
nose
is
filled
with
clove
alcohol
and
a
strong
bready
presence
the
flavor
scales
back
on
the
bread
and
picks
up
more
clove
along
with
a
bit
of
banana
booze
there
as
well
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
pretty
good
though
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
nowhere
near
celebrator
d
4
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
afternoon
or
lazy
day
it
doesnt
bring
anything
extraordinary
to
the
table
but
has
a
sweet
and
smooth
wheaty
taste
that
addresses
the
palate
well
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
originally
compared
it
to
the
hofbrauhaus
hefe
in
overall
taste
but
after
having
a
couple
over
the
past
few
months
i
can
really
sense
some
fairly
large
differences
make
an
effort
to
pick
one
up
and
give
it
a
try
you
wont
be
disappointed
what
to
make
of
a
weizenbock
that
drinks
more
like
a
hefeweizen
im
rendered
speechless
what
is
there
to
say
german
breweries
in
general
and
ayinger
in
particular
have
consistently
excellent
output
this
offering
has
made
the
distinct
and
strong
style
exceptionally
agreeable
and
unthinkably
drinkable
i
guess
all
i
can
do
is
recommend
it
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
descent
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
yeasty
wheat
with
hints
of
bananas
and
cloves
hints
of
citrus
very
clean
tasting
for
this
style
the
banana
clove
tastes
are
subtle
hints
of
lemon
pepper
and
orange
with
a
very
sweet
front
end
overall
a
very
clean
and
easy
drinking
beer
o
a
very
nice
wheat
choice
all
that
youd
expect
from
one
but
more
pronounced
and
warmer
i
dont
think
this
is
necessarily
a
classic
example
of
the
style
im
thinking
more
of
aventinus
with
a
bigger
malty
bock
like
chocolate
note
for
me
this
is
just
a
higher
abv
hefeweizen
this
is
still
an
excellent
beer
though
must
try
overall
not
overly
impressed
with
this
one
in
comparison
with
others
of
the
style
still
its
nearly
indistinguishable
characteristics
from
a
regular
version
of
the
style
make
it
a
nice
drink
o
this
one
is
a
beer
i
will
certainly
try
again
wow
great
offering
ws
500
ml
bottle
from
wf
arlington
pours
a
nice
hazy
bright
yellow
color
with
a
frothy
two
to
three
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
some
lace
the
aroma
is
of
toffee
and
nice
citrus
fruits
and
a
sweetness
the
taste
follows
suit
a
sweet
malt
backbone
hit
with
hints
of
banana
like
a
hef
as
well
as
light
citrus
fruits
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
creamy
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
high
it
is
an
easy
drink
with
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
goin
future
months
are
looking
good
only
march
and
i
found
this
beautiful
wheat
beer
to
spend
some
time
with
delicious
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
robust
offering
but
this
beer
delivers
a
nice
experience
with
what
it
gives
and
definitely
is
worth
a
few
sips
fullish
body
light
effervescence
slightly
warming
very
very
good
rich
almost
silky
as
it
flows
towards
the
throat
excellent
im
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
a
fan
of
this
brewery
and
am
not
disappointed
in
any
way
here
not
quite
a
new
favourite
but
definitely
a
good
brew
poured
this
wizen
bock
out
of
a
500
ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
it
produced
a
beautiful
think
bright
white
frothy
head
it
settled
to
a
2
finger
widths
and
was
very
well
carbonated
there
was
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
beer
had
a
aroma
of
rich
wheat
with
hints
of
lemon
banana
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
the
taste
was
overall
very
nice
very
much
dominated
by
wheat
and
finished
with
light
citrus
and
banana
here
was
also
a
slight
taste
of
clove
very
good
example
of
a
weizenbock
prost
notes
this
is
a
lovely
showcase
of
deep
wheaty
flavor
light
colored
for
the
style
cream
and
brassy
gold
with
a
fine
soft
white
head
that
leaves
some
gritty
lace
on
the
glass
tangy
wheat
malt
and
big
banana
in
the
nose
with
apples
clove
and
bubblegum
overripe

with
hay
and
a
crackerlike
dryness
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
palatte
scrubbing
carbonation
another
fine
beer
from
ayinger
the
color
when
poured
was
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
reddish
hue
little
foar
and
no
lace
the
smell
had
the
aroma
of
wheat
yeast
fruit
spice
and
citrus
the
flavor
bad
the
taste
of
yeast
a
hint
of
banana
orangelemon
with
a
touch
all
spice
not
to
citrusy
not
overly
sweet
a
nice
balance
of
all
the
compentents
that
will
make
this
weizenbock
a
favorite
for
all
weizenbock
drinkers
d
very
drinkable
i
could
put
quite
a
few
of
these
down
with
no
problem
at
all
a
good
companion
with
grilled
meat
quite
too
pricy
around
here
given
its
not
so
outstanding
value
drink
another
ayinger
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
it
was
very
drinkable
and
id
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
anytime
drinkability
not
your
average
weizenbock
but
i
am
not
complaining
another
high
class
brew
from
a
high
class
brewery
d
its
very
drinkable
but
better
to
enjoy
steadily
pretty
solid
overall
poured
out
of
12
oz
bottle
into
dimpled
mug
pours
hazy
dark
yellow
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
has
creamy
wheat
some
banana
esters
light
spices
and
is
a
bit
rich
medium
full
body
with
lots
of
flowing
soft
carbonation
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
is
very
smooth
and
full
with
smooth
wheat
and
some
cinnamonlike
spice
on
the
finish
with
lots
of
effervescence
this
does
not
really
fit
my
concept
of
a
winter
warmer
style
but
a
nice
german
weizenbock
drinkability
this
beer
may
just
be
the
best
ive
ever
had
world
class
for
sure
goes
down
uber
smooth
dexcellent
highly
drinkable
pours
from
the

that
stays
for
quite
a
while
very
active
carbonation
tons
and
tons
of
bubbles
rising
in
the
murky

aroma
is
of
banana
lemon
and
perhaps
a
little
orange
with
a
hint
of
spice
coriander
as
well
1st
sip
is
an
amazingly
delicious
blend
of
the
banana
and
citrus
with
a
soft
sweet
almost
candylike
undertone
the
classic
wheat
malt
crispness
shines
through
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
full
with
a
nice
sparkle
from
the
carbonation
drinkability
is
almost
too
good
for
a
beer
with
that
packs
a
7
1
abv
punch
these
would
be
such
a
treat
on
a
hot
summer
day
although
it
hits
the
spot
here
in
january
too
overall
a
very
tasty
and
satisfying
beer
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
this
soon
and
letting
some
age
for
summertime
d
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
beer
over
7
and
really
smooth
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
pours
a
goldenorange
hue
with
some
good
lookin
haziness
not
much
of
a
head
seemed
to
form
up
but
what
did
seems
to
leave
pretty
good
lacing
on
the
glass
has
a
very
fruit
forward
aroma
with
some
vanillacreamy
notes
and
a
slight
butterscotch
smell
to
it
pretty
enticing
taste
is
insanely
creamy
and
full
of
bananas
butterscotch
and
natural
fruity
yeast
flavors
touch
of
sweetness
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
with
just
a
tad
bit
of
bitterness
and
alcohol
presence
to
round
the
brew
out
nicely
very
smooth
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
leaning
towards
the
mediumlight
body
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
that
should
be
shared
drinkability
is
definitely
on
the
high
side
such
a
flavorful
and
delightful
experience
to
kick
back
and
enjoy
this
one
drinkability
its
a
good
drink
with
a
complex
flavor
and
cannot
be
consumed
quickly
its
a
sit
down
experience
d
eminently
drinkable
wish
i
had
more
tonight
a
nice
pretty
warm
and
wheaty
fruity
and
yeasty
german
ale
not
nearly
as
strongseeming
as
the
labeled
abv
would
indicate
which
suggests
a
certain
set
of
capable
integration
skills
if
not
any
more
overall
complexity
than
what
i
am
able
to
describe
here
i
really
have
to
admit
i
am
hot
and
cold
with
weizenbocks
i
really
dug
this
one
it
is
a
quality
beer
with
so
much
drinkability
i
savored
it
since
i
only
had
one
bottle
it
is
one
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
again
and
again
the
blend
of
wheat
and
bock
is
seamless
and
it
is
a
substantial
all
around
pleasant
and
delectable
beer
d
not
my
cup
of
tea
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
spices
and
banana
taste
is
good
banana
spices
grains
lots
of
flavor
coming
through
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
top
quality
beer
cant
say
i
have
much
to
compare
this
to
except
for
the
darker
aventinus
but
it
definitely
speaks
for
and
stands
on
its
own
and
based
on
its
merits
a
very
well
put
together
weizenbock
and
worth
seeking
out
to
try
overall
a
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
other
siblings
from
ayinger
quite
notably
i
look
out
my
window
and
see
the
snow
starting
to
fall
and
whip
around
tumultuously
as
i
sip
this
no
worries
this
ale
is
a
soothing
cold
weather
treat
i
feel
like
im
flying
first
class
in
stormy
weather
but
do
not
feel
even
the
least
bit
of
turbulence
and
this
is
the
kind
of
ride
i
like
overall
this
has
been
a
long
time
favorite
of
ours
and
is
the
beer
that
got
us
into
weizenbocks
what
is
best
about
this
beer
is
the
complexity
of
the
taste
there
is
such
a
range
of
flavors
here
from
fruit
to
cream
to
smoke
which
curiously
and
expertly
are
melded
together
to
form
an
entirely
unique
brew
of
the
highest
quality
i
think
id
rate
this
beer
the
equal
of
weihenstephaner
vitus
and
in
fact
i
think
i
enjoy
it
just
a
little
bit
better
in
philly
wow
good
stuff
highly
recommend
if
you
like
wheat
beers
outstanding
d
high
a
very
enjoyable
brew
left
me
wanting
more
drinkability
this
is
an
all
around
terrific
beer
and
shows
a
lot
of
discipline
for
this
most
difficult
style
id
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
hardest
beers
to
do
just
right
but
ayinger
pulled
it
off
quite
nicely
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
smooth
light
carbonation
drying
on
the
finish
pretty
good
drinkability
alcohol
is
a
bit
prominent
and
the
size
makes
balance
a
bit
more
of
an
issue
while
this
is
still
a
very
balanced
beer
it
seems
like
the
effort
to
maintain
that
balance
is
more
obvious
drinkability
highly
refreshing
alcohol
is
pretty
well
masked
price
brings
the
drinkability
down
a
bit
4
for
500ml
no
doubt
this
is
among
the
best
ive
had
among
its
style
this
is
a
beer
i
would
love
to
enjoy
again
down
the
road
alright
this
was
a
surprise
someone
at
a
beer
store
told
me
i
should
try
this
onethat
it
is
really
good
and
right
they
were
i
poured
this
into
a
glasschecked
out
the
nice
golden
haze
watched
the
tiny
bubbles
i
took
a
drink
of
it
and
tasted
a
lil
citrusbut
unexpectedly
banana
and
cloves
the
beer
has
a
fresh
and
smooth
taste
to
it
great
taste
of
hops
and
malts
alcohol
of
7
1
i
became
happier
the
more
i
drank
i
tried
to
enjoy
every
single
drink
before
i
wanted
i
had
finished
17oz
after
that
i
was
mad
for
not
buying
more
wow
what
a
great
beeri
will
be
buying
more
soon
and
trying
to
share
some
with
my
friends
d
this
was
a
very
nice
weizenbock
with
superb
balance
and
clean
taste
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
was
super
easy
to
drink
i
liked
this
better
than
celebrator
and
rank
it
among
the
top
weizenbocks
very
well
done
brew
ayinger
weizenbock
was
very
hazy
and
yelloworange
in
color
it
had
a
very
large
fluffy
white
head
with
good
retention
the
aroma
was
banana
clove
and
wheat
the
taste
was
full
of
banana
clove
and
pepper
with
some
wheat
and
light
malt
mixed
in
the
finish
was
dry
with
more
yeast
flavors
spices
and
a
little
throat
warming
alcohol
coming
through
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
medium
body
and
fairly
high
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
as
well
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
well
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
is
quite
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
unlike
a
typical
weizenbock
this
is
pale
colored
with
very
little
dark
malt
character
for
this
reason
i
think
this
is
a
beer
that
would
have
been
better
if
it
was
fresher
in
the
nose
is
a
moderate
yeastiness
with
a
touch
of
bannana
bready
malt
comes
through
as
well
but
id
like
some
more
malt
character
on
the
palate
the
body
is
noticeably
heavier
and
wheatier
than
a
typical
hefeweizen
alcohol
heat
is
kept
to
a
minimum
carbonation
is
a
little
low
failing
to
liven
up
such
a
hefty
wheat
beer
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
id
prefer
a
regular
hefeweizen
or
a
more
traditional
weizenbock
drink
what
a
great
weizenbock
a
deservedly
earned
solid
a
i
havent
had
a
bad
ayinger
yet
and
the
trend
continues
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
it
really
hides
its
strength
quite
well
which
is
certainly
dangerous
in
a
7
1
beer
i
really
like
how
vibrant
the
traditional
hefeweizen
character
is
here
it
definitely
seems
like
the
character
volume
has
been
turned
up
a
bit
which
is
really
then
only
subtle
sign
that
this
is
not
a
traditional
strength
hefewiezen
very
tasty
and
one
that
i
am
definitely
enjoying
this
must
be
an
absolutely
killer
beer
when
it
is
fresh
d
not
a
problem
at
all
to
drink
the
half
liter
bottle
of
this
one
maybe
not
quite
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
weizenbocks
ive
had
but
still
quite
quaffable
pours
a
little
bit
hazy
and
a
beautiful
pale
amber
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
twofinger
of
soapy
head
that
persists
as
a
offwhite
crown
leaving
no
lacing
to
speak
of
wonderful
grapefruit
peel
and
lemon
peel
aromas
along
with
some
wheat
malt
and
yeastiness
some
spiciness
more
typical
of
belgian
golden
ales
is
in
there
wonderful
so
far
rich
and
full
mouthfeel
of
german
goodiness
if
i
had
to
pick
one
beer
that
ive
ever
had
that
screamed
germany
to
me
this
is
it
its
one
of
the
most
drinkable
7
brews
ive
ever
had
and
i
could
see
myself
and
probably
any
beer
lover
getting
stupid
drunk
off
this
very
quickly
flavor
profile
is
loaded
with
banana
yeast
wheatiness
this
is
delicious
beer
i
could
session
this
and
get
hella
sick
for
sure
high
abv
wonderfully
masked
this
beer
is
really
good
and
probably
great
any
season
hot
or
cold
you
should
always
have
a
few
bottles
of
this
in
your
stash
top
notch
this
beer
has
everything
i
love
in
a
hefeweizen
and
more
poured
a
bright
gold
with
a
tinge
of
haze
fluffy
white
head
and
sharp
aroma
of
spices
slightly
tart
at
the
front
then
softening
with
pronounced
clove
and
spice
with
muted
yeasty
banana
notes
in
the
background
a
tiny
bite
of
pepper
at
the
end
which
could
have
been
etoh
or
the
yeast
spicyness
finish
was
slightly
sweet
a
classic
the
taste
like
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
esters
and
phenols
lead
the
way
with
some
light
maltiness
buried
beneath
the
fruit
and
spice
it
has
a
bit
of
an
applecinnamon
character
along
with
the
banana
notes
you
would
expect
from
a
hefeweizen
yeast
the
body
is
medium
bordering
on
full
and
the
sweetness
becomes
a
bit
cloying
after
a
few
ounces
as
this
really
doesnt
dry
up
in
the
finish
at
all
banana
bread
flavors
linger
on
the
tongue
between
sips
spicy
phenols
become
more
prevalent
as
the
beer
warms
which
doesnt
enhance
the
drinkability
much
a
fairly
good
beer
but
not
great
ill
stick
to
vitus
if
i
want
a
pale
weizenbock
drinkability
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
i
almost
wish
i
was
sipping
it
along
with
my
hookah
at
7
1
abv
it
might
not
be
a
beer
that
id
go
back
to
more
than
once
per
evening
but
definitely
worth
a
sixpack
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
very
satisfying
d
the
beer
is
quite
refreshing
and
the
alcohol
content
is
completely
hidden
from
both
the
smell
and
taste
dvery
drinkable
very
affordable
cloudy
honeycolored
brew
with
rigorous
carbonation
gives
a
huge
3
of
white
sticky
meringue
head
nose
gives
a
great
pineapple
sweetness
a
bit
of
banana
and
cinnamon
taste
is
also
sweet
pineapple
spiked
with
cinnamon
a
bit
of
yeast
and
general
wheaty
spice
feels
wonderfully
thick
and
creamy
soft
carbonation
no
sign
of
the
7
1
abv
very
smooth
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
but
still
very
tasty
highly
recommended
cloudy
caramel
amber
colour
with
a
fairly
dense
white
cap
kind
of
short
but
with
great
head
retention
sticky
and
a
bit
clumpy
lots
of
lacing
bready
and
banana
in
the
nose
cloves
and
caramel
notes
of
bubblegum
and
faint
citrus
low
bitterness
sugary
caramel
flavour
with
fruity
bubblegum
banana
and
a
hint
of
lemon
in
the
finish
bread
and
wheat
crackers
some
yeast
and
mild
alcohol
spicy
in
the
finish
lots
of
flavour
but
surprisingly
balanced
and
mellow
medium
bodied
lots
of
carbonation
that
was
a
bit
creamy
and
smooth
some
dryness
and
a
hint
of
warmth
great
stuff
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
d
this
beer
has
nice
classic
weizen
qualities
with
pleasant
club
soda
and
soft
hop
support
this
is
a
great
weizen
that
is
not
a
full
meal
like
many
and
goes
down
really
smooth
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
d
such
a
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
easily
do
three
of
these
16
9oz
bottles
a
really
pleasant
experience
16
9
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
it
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
few
inches
of
head
smells
include
banana
cloves
and
peaches
taste
is
again
very
prominent
in
cloves
and
banana
aftertaste
is
slightly
metallic
this
is
very
smooth
and
refreshing
with
almost
no
bite
from
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
and
bubbly
this
is
another
solid
version
of
what
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
beer
is
fruity
and
mildly
bitter
finishes
wet
and
has
a
medium
to
light
feel
in
the
mouth
lots
of
carbonation
on
the
palate
and
some
nice
flavors
throughout
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
in
a
minute
very
enjoyable
high
drinkability
and
good
mouthfeel
yessir
this
one
hits
the
spot
slightly
on
the
malty
side
but
exquisitely
balanced
edit
reminds
me
a
bunch
of
vitus
wish
i
would
have
saved
it
to
drink
side
by
side
d
of
course
i
want
more
any
time
any
place
i
just
want
more
a
world
class
weizenbock
at
first
pour
i
wonder
where
they
get
the
sense
to
put
bock
in
the
name
this
is
rather
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
great
pearlesent
head
a
very
attractive
beer
but
not
the
brownish
body
i
was
expecting
when
i
pryed
off
the
cap
very
attractive
looking
non
the
less
spices
and
banana
yeasty
estery
and
light
fruit
such
as
pears
red
apples
yeast
is
pretty
forefront
considering
the
style
but
i
offer
the
disclaimer
i
did
pour
in
the
yeast
hefe
style
half
way
through
this
review
im
not
one
to
shy
away
from
a
good
helping
of
yeast
if
its
around
medium
carbination
in
a
medium
light
body
with
a
semi
dry
finish
this
one
is
great
and
refreshing
chilled
right
now
as
im
sitting
in
my
80f
room
very
drinkable
this
is
one
i
would
enjoy
keeping
stocked
as
a
refreshing
summer
beer
very
good
i
poured
into
my
glass
to
a
generous
three
finger
white
head
i
smell
is
wheat
yeast
spices
clove
some
citrus
and
banana
its
a
golden
amber
color
it
is
lighter
in
color
than
i
expected
the
taste
is
banana
cloves
yeast
there
is
also
a
bready
malt
character
to
it
there
is
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
coming
from
the
lasar
etching
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
also
noticed
a
layer
of
yeast
settled
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beverage
i
have
liked
all
the
weizenbocks
that
i
have
tried
to
date
d
only
bought
one
bottle
but
i
can
see
drinking
it
all
evening
long
overall
a
very
nice
beer
super
easy
drinking
quite
refreshing
i
will
have
to
pick
more
of
this
up
for
the
summer
m
maybe
just
a
bit
too
much
foam
once
it
enters
the
mouth
medium
body
good
mouthcoating
nice
beer
but
i
was
wishing
it
was
aventinus
the
whole
time
the
perfection
of
that
beer
makes
other
nice
beers
pale
in
comparison
quite
literally
fantastic
really
good
drinkability
enjoy
d
overall
ayinger
weizenbock
is
a
world
class
beer
thats
definitely
worth
picking
up
this
beer
is
welcome
in
my
fridge
any
day
highly
recommended
was
pumped
to
see
this
as
no
one
in
my
area
stocked
vitus
this
year
pours
a
very
hazy
amber
with
fluffy
white
head
fades
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
thin
sheets
of
lace
smell
heavy
on
wheat
and
overripe
banana
faint
spicy
hops
faint
butterscotch
taste
banana
wheat
cracker
a
touch
of
cloves
and
a
bit
buttery
a
touch
of
slushy
red
delicious
apple
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
active
carbonation
with
a
fluffy
creamy
feel
pretty
nice
but
not
great
not
my
taste
i
could
see
some
people
really
liking
this
beer
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
certainly
enjoyable
and
drinkable
the
nose
was
a
little
too
muted
unfortunately
and
the
look
disappointed
by
the
end
but
nevertheless
this
is
a
good
brew
worth
checking
out
d
definitely
a
solid
weizenbock
definitely
worth
seeking
out
the
palate
opens
with
something
ive
never
experienced
in
a
beer
before
jackfruit
yep
jackfruit
probably
a
useless
descriptor
cos
its
nigh
on
impossible
to
find
it
in
the
us
but
growing
up
eating
the
heck
out
of
it
i
find
it
rather
unmistakable
mildly
stinky
with
plenty
of
other
flavors
to
go
around
especially
bread
honey
and
a
little
brown
sugar
this
beer
is
rather
intriguing
on
the
palate
just
a
touch
of
smoke
is
present
as
well
this
is
seriously
off
the
wall
moderately
sweet
on
the
finish
with
the
spices
coming
in
especially
clove
and
a
little
cinnamon
this
medium
bodied
beer
has
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
with
a
lingering
finish
with
honey
a
little
smoke
and
some
spice
it
also
does
come
across
as
a
touch
watery
but
this
really
is
a
very
very
interesting
beer
that
i
will
revisit
all
the
visible
bubbles
are
a
bit
of
a
head
fake
as
the
mouth
is
miles
from
fizzy
or
prickly
good
heft
for
7
and
such
subtle
flavor
it
is
no
aventinus
and
i
believe
id
select
an
excellent
hefe
over
this
ayinger
brew
excellent
purchase
almost
want
to
drop
some
ice
cream
in
it
for
a
cream
pie
in
a
glass
love
the
way
this
evolves
as
it
warms
d
extremely
quaffable
for
a
7
beer
goes
down
far
too
easy
for
a
beer
that
could
sneak
up
on
you
i
am
ashamed
to
say
this
is
my
first
ayinger
beer
but
i
will
try
them
all
now
d
this
beer
is
excellent
great
flavor
and
the
alcohol
seems
non
exsistent
very
well
crafted
d
refreshing
and
flavorful
bigger
medium
body
soft
round
tangy
smooth
fluffy
and
a
delight
to
let
sink
in
its
much
like
a
really
good
hefe
but
with
more
body
and
therefore
much
better
then
most
hefes
in
that
dept
i
really
enjoyed
the
way
it
feels
in
the
mouth
and
the
way
it
drinks
with
so
much
ease
very
soft
smooth
and
fluffy
with
an
incredible
balance
of
tang
perhaps
the
just
over
7
might
be
a
small
set
back
for
drinking
more
then
a
few
of
these
quickly
but
damn
if
that
isnt
an
oxymoron
with
this
stuff
solid
as
always
ayinger
is
my
fav
german
available
brewery
here
in
mn
dthis
is
quite
a
tasty
brew
definitely
more
hefe
than
bock
but
the
flavors
work
very
well
together
highly
carbonated
and
good
body
keep
it
quite
refreshing
d
a
solid
weizenbock
but
ill
take
an
aventinus
over
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
its
a
very
drinkable
strong
hefe
basically
bockwise
it
compares
poorly
next
to
the
excellent
aventinus
weizenbock
though
hoslaps
every
other
bock
ive
ever
had
period
pours
a
cloudy
pale
golden
straw
topped
by
more
than
enough
bright
white
foamy
head
that
left
surprisingly
little
lacing
behind
the
smell
holds
notes
of
banana
clove
wheat
sugar
cane
and
toasted
rice
the
taste
generally
follows
those
clovey
banana
notes
up
front
followed
by
a
rush
of
wheat
and
a
vague
sense
of
noncloying
sweetness
ending
with
some
coriander
and
a
yeasty
funk
that
melds
nicely
with
the
wheaty
flavors
the
body
is
medium
at
best
with
perfect
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
texture
overall
a
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
brew
drinkability
is
great
another
fine
creation
from
ayinger
strong
like
the
horned
goat
and
smooth
like
the
winter
snow
im
down
for
another
and
more
if
you
can
find
this
brew
poured
a
wellcarbonated
dirty
gold
with
frothy
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
and
dies
slowly
with
lace
a
clear
wheatyeast
twang
with
some
spicy
clove
and
a
lemonyorange
citric
dominates
the
nose
but
there
is
a
strong
malty
background
as
well
a
great
smoothness
and
balance
is
in
this
lighter
weizenbock
with
a
citric
and
clove
taste
along
with
some
residual
wheat
sweetness
combo
w
some
type
of
candi
sugaresque
sweet
malt
for
a
light
to
medium
body
beer
that
has
a
sweet
touch
along
with
a
distinct
sharp
hefe
taste
and
it
finishes
slightly
nutty
and
dry
not
a
strong
beer
although
the
abv
is
deceptive
but
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
lighter
to
medium
body
with
the
great
spritzy
carbonation
of
a
weizen
very
easy
to
drink
as
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticed
very
delicious
brauerei
aying
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
german
breweries
thats
largely
due
to
the
excellent
brau
weisse
but
urweisse
oktober
festmarzen
and
jahrhundert
bier
are
very
good
in
their
own
right
weizenbock
is
an
outstanding
weizenbock
if
you
like
em
pale
malted
and
bananarific
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
big
white
head
smell
is
of
freshly
cut
wheat
and
a
nice
yeast
phenol
taste
is
light
and
syrupy
sweet
up
front
with
a
grainy
wheaty
middle
and
a
tart
yeasty
finish
mouthfeel
is
super
thick
and
creamy
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
good
especially
for
7
abv
this
is
an
excellent
weizenbock
that
i
plan
to
get
again
500ml
bottle
slightly
hazy
golden
beer
body
with
a
large
tightly
bubbled
white
head
lovellyhoneyishspicy
bananabready
aromas
very
delicious
my
mouth
is
watering
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
a
more
phenolic
quality
and
for
me
hints
of
marischino
cherries
peppery
finish
nice
intresting
mouthfeel
to
this
its
carbonated
but
just
anough
to
let
this
roll
over
the
tongue
easily
very
nice
beer
i
am
really
enjoying
this
quite
good
but
you
got
to
like
characterful
and
sweet
wheat
beers
to
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
where
hops
are
absent
the
complexity
and
balance
comes
from
the
intense
spicy
phenols
and
frutiy
esters
and
that
odd
meaty
taste
overall
a
really
good
brew
one
of
the
best
weizenbocks
that
i
have
had
after
hearing
that
this
beer
was
a
must
perhaps
my
expectations
were
a
bit
too
high
as
a
fan
of
vitus
i
was
thinking
that
maybe
this
beer
might
be
a
good
partner
to
it
frankly
vitus
kicks
this
beers
butt
all
over
the
place
so
while
this
is
a
good
beer
its
not
in
the
upper
echelon
of
wbs
d
hmm
tough
call
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
its
delicious
but
i
wouldnt
really
want
anothertonight
that
is
a
500ml
bottle
is
a
nice
serving
size
1
pt
9
fl
oz
bottle
served
at
52
degrees
in
my
weihenstephan
weizen
glass
poured
all
head
creamy
dense
bright
white
and
occupying
90
of
the
volume
of
the
glass
as
the
head
slowly
receded
it
revealed
a
hazy
orangegold
body
some
strands
of
lacing
but
no
legs
only
a
few
residual
spots
nose
is
dominated
by
bananas
and
cloves
with
a
hint
of
wheat
taste
is
somewhat
of
a
let
down
considering
what
the
nose
put
off
a
mere
shadow
of
the
nose
and
a
bit
watery
with
a
a
strange
aftertaste
maybe
a
little
plasticy
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
and
starts
off
flat
but
as
i
finish
the
bottle
pour
it
becomes
a
bit
more
crisp
better
than
i
initially
anticipated
but
not
quite
where
i
expected
it
to
be
overall
could
potentially
be
past
its
prime
ill
have
to
retry
this
one
at
a
later
date
im
always
on
the
lookout
for
weizenbocks
so
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
tasty
stuff
nice
blended
flavor
not
overpowered
by
any
one
componentnot
too
spicy
not
too
sweet
i
also
liked
the
mouthfeel
of
this
ive
had
some
strong
bocks
that
felt
watery
but
not
this
one
good
stuff
my
first
oh
shit
beer
of
2010
comes
from
my
favorite
german
brewery
and
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
im
very
glad
merchant
du
vin
began
importing
this
beer
to
the
states
because
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
stuff
very
soon
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
huge
foamy
white
head
that
isnt
going
anywhere
smell
is
strong
of
banana
clove
and
yeast
smell
and
appearance
suggest
a
hefe
rather
than
a
weizenbock
this
is
barely
darker
than
your
average
hefe
taste
leads
off
with
a
blast
of
banana
with
some
spiciness
going
down
smooth
malt
balances
the
other
flavors
perfectly
flavor
is
top
notch
and
lingers
on
the
palate
nicely
carbonation
is
perfect
for
the
style
and
helps
the
beer
go
down
really
well
another
great
wheat
offering
from
ayinger
ill
be
buying
a
lot
more
of
these
once
warmer
weather
rolls
around
d
very
good
id
say
this
is
more
of
a
summer
beer
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
a
weizenbock
looking
forward
to
this
one
poured
this
one
in
to
a
weiss
glass
color
is
a
murky
orange
light
for
this
style
and
a
quick
to
fade
white
head
from
the
nose
i
get
some
pear
and
apple
cream
and
some
chalky
yeast
taste
has
a
whole
array
of
fruit
such
as
banana
pear
and
apple
again
peaches
also
it
has
a
great
bread
like
base
and
even
some
powdered
sugar
qualities
the
carbonation
on
this
one
makes
it
incredibly
drinkable
the
alcohol
cannot
be
felt
at
all
and
goddamn
what
can
i
say
this
is
a
real
treat
and
one
of
the
best
weizenbocks
i
have
ever
had
any
fans
of
the
style
should
seek
this
one
out
immediately
a
little
disappointed
i
didnt
get
quite
the
flavor
i
look
forward
to
in
a
dark
wheat
doppelbock
this
heres
a
blonde
wheat
bock
and
tastes
more
like
a
regular
hefe
weizen
with
a
bit
more
body
tasty
though
undeniably
tasty
dits
a
good
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
a
little
apparent
for
me
it
reminded
me
of
their
dunkel
but
a
bit
stronger
and
maybe
a
bit
sweeter
i
really
like
the
aventinus
version
of
this
style
because
of
the
dark
color
and
more
complex
flavor
the
ayinger
weizenbock
is
decent
but
not
much
different
than
their
dunkel
version
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
probably
not
worth
getting
again
soon
d
nice
drinkability
but
a
pint
sits
well
here
solid
recommend
and
cant
go
wrong
with
this
brewery
a
classic
for
sure
a
hw
on
steroids
very
bananaish
with
nice
spicing
drinks
very
well
even
with
alcohol
touch
that
adds
a
nice
pepper
note
a
strong
hw
thus
weizen
bock
that
is
dreamy
this
is
hugely
deserving
of
its
acclaim
and
instantly
goes
to
the
top
of
the
list
in
terms
of
my
favourite
weizenbocks
this
should
definitely
be
regarded
in
the
same
league
as
the
aventinus
and
vitus
of
this
world
very
clovey
very
dry
body
and
highly
carbonated
wheat
malts
aplenty
balance
with
german
hops
and
light
yeast
esters
that
suggest
pear
and
banana
slight
tinge
of
ethanol
in
the
background
lets
you
know
the
7
1
is
working
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
the
creaminess
picks
up
after
several
minutes
as
the
intense
carbonation
settles
to
a
more
reasonable
level
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
when
drinkability
is
taken
into
consideration
but
ayinger
still
makes
a
very
tasty
weizenbock
d
a
good
drinker
overall
pretty
tasty
sweet
with
a
warm
finish
pours
a
cloudy
dark
straw
color
with
a
white
head
the
main
aroma
is
bready
malts
and
german
yeast
but
you
also
get
some
banana
and
clove
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
banana
and
clove
but
the
bready
malts
are
still
there
thinner
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
had
read
reviews
stating
this
was
basically
a
soupedup
hefeweizen
and
those
reviews
were
correct
whatever
it
is
it
is
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
disappointing
it
probably
does
not
deserve
the
average
score
i
gave
it
feels
flat
it
just
lies
on
the
palate
with
no
life
and
this
also
limits
drinkability
what
otherwise
could
be
a
wheat
ale
for
the
cold
weather
makes
it
somewhat
of
a
drag
to
drink
d
nice
helles
weizenbock
didnt
wow
me
with
flavour
but
a
solid
example
of
the
style
from
this
country
brewery
d
could
be
dangerous
alcohol
is
barely
perceptable
and
it
possesses
all
the
refreshing
qualities
of
a
normal
hefe
bigger
bolder
and
delicious
doesnt
hamper
this
d
d
good
as
this
is
a
smooth
lighter
side
beer
and
it
is
sweet
the
late
soapy
taste
drove
the
drinkability
down
a
bit
but
it
remains
good

d
personally
i
could
session
this
but
for
someone
not
used
to
the
above
average
abv
this
could
be
a
sneaky
brew
its
just
so
incredibly
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
you
know
i
didnt
even
know
ayinger
made
a
weizenbockman
was
i
in
in
the
dark
poured
a
mix
of
tea
and
lemonade
with
a
large
blooming
crown
atop
that
settled
very
slowly
into
a
creamylike
mass
a
mix
of
green
apple
and
lemon
stands
out
most
in
the
noselight
yeasty
spice
and
sweet
alcohol
shows
thru
as
well
lightly
medicinal
and
clove
spice
hit
the
palate
melding
into
lemon
pith
and
sweetish
alcoholalthough
the
alcohol
is
not
obtrusive
honestly
i
would
have
never
imagined
the
abv
of
this
beerits
not
light
as
far
as
feel
goesit
just
goes
down
easily
a
nice
beer
from
a
very
tradional
brewery
cloudy
goldenlightorange
with
a
huge
tightpacked
head
that
settles
very
very
slowly
citrusyeasty
smell
that
reminds
me
of
something
belgian
i
drank
last
night
yes
lighter
than
expected
this
is
creamier
yet
has
a
nice
carbonated
edge
the
sweetness
does
not
overwhelm
or
stay
around
thankfully
i
like
its
punctuality
noting
some
sourness
that
compliments
that
smack
of
sweetness
good
balance
drinkable
for
the
style
for
sure
just
not
my
favorite
style
id
still
definitely
take
one
of
these
anytime
nice
to
finally
try
this
one
tangy
wheat
and
the
yeast
esters
give
this
kind
of
a
imperial
hefeweizen
flavor
with
some
light
graininess
and
alcohol
suggestions
not
overly
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
actually
is
one
of
the
lightest
feeling
wiezenbocks
i
have
had
still
a
very
tasty
beverage
that
goes
down
very
easily
considering
the
abv
i
like
it
but
not
quite
as
much
as
aventinus
and
vitus
d
a
whole
lot
of
weizen
not
much
bock
this
is
basically
a
slightly
soupedup
hefe
thats
not
a
bad
thing
though
recommended
for
fans
of
german
wheat
beers
not
much
for
that
kind
of
mouthfeel
and
hence
makes
this
guy
undrinkable
for
the
most
part
glad
i
only
bought
one
the
aroma
is
pretty
much
the
flavor
no
thanks
overall
maybe
i
went
into
this
expecting
it
to
be
something
it
not
only
wasnt
but
didnt
intend
to
be
so
maybe
my
scores
reflect
my
high
expectations
but
it
didnt
amaze
me
as
id
hoped
ill
have
it
some
more
and
see
what
i
think
but
it
was
fairly
complex
and
the
booze
is
well
hidden
its
interesting
but
perhaps
too
sweet
and
malty
even
for
this
style
hazy
gold
in
color
with
a
huge
rolling
offwhite
and
very
stubborn
head
spice
and
big
bananas
float
to
the
nose
a
modicum
of
coriander
and
yeast
follow
up
creamy
around
the
palate
with
hints
of
citrus
light
fruits
bananas
apples
and
a
malty
base
was
expecting
something
a
bit
darker
and
this
one
could
pass
for
a
straight
up
hefe
and
a
damn
good
one
at
that
opinion
well
to
be
honest
i
am
a
little
surprised
that
i
liked
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
i
am
not
a
fan
of
weizen
beers
so
i
put
this
review
off
for
a
couple
weeks
i
do
like
aventinus
quite
a
bit
but
i
like
that
it
is
a
darker
bock
style
this
one
being
light
colored
intimidated
me
a
bit
as
i
like
the
dunkel
weisse
more
than
the
hefe
all
this
said
this
beer
really
surprised
me
it
is
very
drinkable
thought
it
is
fermented
at
least
partially
with
weizen
yeast
i
really
like
the
balance
in
this
beer
and
it
makes
it
really
approachable
and
drinkable
to
me
i
would
definitely
not
hesitate
to
try
this
beer
again
and
would
look
forward
to
trying
it
on
tap
d
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
perfect
balance
complex
flavors
and
a
nice
warmth
make
this
one
a
winner
i
hope
to
revisit
this
again
the
next
time
it
comes
around
d
very
smooth
and
drinkable
good
beer
and
a
style
i
havent
had
often
if
at
all
ayinger
rarely
disappoints
but
i
have
a
lot
to
learn
about
german
beer
and
classic
german
beer
the
body
is
light
while
remaining
full
very
pleasing
to
the
touch
drinkability
is
topnotch
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
having
multiples
would
be
a
pleasure
grab
a
couple
next
time
you
see
it
1200
d
very
drinkable
especially
in
the
summer
months
combine
that
with
the
zingy
abv
and
it
may
sneak
up
on
you
flavors
are
well
integrated
downshot
is
that
it
does
seem
a
bit
filling
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
a
really
nice
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
an
outstanding
hefe
yeast
aroma
the
bananaclove
character
is
well
pronounced
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
solid
malt
flavor
that
s
extremely
dry
with
a
nice
fruity
yeast
finish
the
yeast
character
really
makes
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
weizenbock
ive
been
a
fan
of
ayinger
beers
before
but
this
one
is
outstanding
wow
really
glad
i
got
to
check
this
one
out
perhaps
my
favorite
style
done
in
a
helles
version
of
a
weizenbock
hard
to
go
toe
to
toe
with
aventinus
but
this
is
the
best
example
of
a
nondunkel
version
i
remember
having
to
date
drinkability
that
lively
engaging
effervescence
lends
a
remarkable
keen
ease
to
the
overall
drinkability
making
for
a
fine
enjoyable
wheaty
brew
fuller
end
of
medium
bod
with
a
lot
of
smooth
bread
yeast
this
gives
the
beer
a
lot
of
its
full
body
and
contributes
wonderfully
to
the
flavor
lots
of
zesty
peppery
spice
and
crisp
citrus
fruit
are
very
well
integrated
making
this
beer
extremely
flavorful
and
quite
complex
plenty
of
ripe
banana
along
with
hints
of
apple
lemon
zest
pepper
clove
and
citrus
lemon
peel
all
of
these
flavors
are
extremely
well
balanced
with
no
one
flavor
overpowering
the
other
and
the
abv
is
excellently
masked
making
this
beer
extremely
quaffable
highly
recommended
for
german
wheat
beer
fans
or
anyone
reall
excellent
d
awesome
d
here
first
sip
turned
into
a
quaff
on
the
second
bottle
killed
waay
too
quick
weizenbocks
are
a
great
style
this
is
one
of
the
top
2
in
my
book
recent
bottle
pours
big
head
on
lighter
yellow
body
aroma
is
pure
bannana
good
thick
mouthfeel
and
bannana
in
the
taste
more
like
a
hefeweizen
drinkability
was
good
i
was
looking
for
more
of
an
edge
and
complexity
i
love
so
much
in
weizenbocks
this
was
full
just
the
bannana
overode
the
taste
department
overall
an
exceptional
brew
and
top
23
weizenbocks
that
ive
had
a
most
welcome
addition
to
the
aying
family
most
highly
recommend
rotation
avail
in
tx
and
will
be
a
big
player
in
the
rotation
d
very
drinkable
i
would
recommend
getting
this
one
if
you
see
it
on
a
menu
it
wont
disappoint
i
would
recommend
drinking
this
beer
at
a
warmer
temperature
than
normal
serving
temperature
to
fully
experience
the
full
range
of
fruits
and
fermentation
character
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
still
lacks
some
of
the
dark
fruits
and
maltiness
from
german
bocks
that
i
so
love
in
weizenbock
to
me
this
is
almost
more
of
a
maibock
i
can
appreciate
the
pale
weizenbock
but
miss
the
dark
fruits
especially
quite
drinkable
alcohol
is
wellhidden
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
light
colored
winter
beer
excellent
flavors
somewhat
sweet
but
has
just
enough
alcohol
to
hold
it
all
together
very
flavorful
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
was
glad
to
see
that
this
would
make
its
way
over
to
the
us
overall
a
wonderful
example
of
a
pale
weizenbock
its
really
just
like
an
amped
up
hefeweizen
i
still
think
i
prefer
the
dunkel
versions
but
ill
drink
one
of
these
any
day
d
this
beer
suits
itself
pretty
well
for
winter
and
for
any
other
time
of
year
for
that
matter
for
a
beer
this
size
it
certainly
doesnt
drink
that
way
almost
refreshing
considering
the
size
a
delicious
beer
and
a
great
representation
of
the
style
good
to
see
this
in
stores
again
drinkability
rates
high
for
this
weizenbock
tasty
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
tried
of
ayingers
besides
their
amazing
doppelbock
i
can
see
why
this
brewery
is
so
celebrated
if
youll
pardon
the
bad
pun
this
beer
threw
me
off
because
i
thought
it
would
be
like
a
dark
wheat
it
is
really
just
a
strong
wheat
beer
the
beer
is
very
good
and
has
a
very
nice
taste
its
flavor
has
a
mix
between
banana
clove
and
zest
with
a
sweetness
and
bitterness
that
blend
together
nicely
at
the
end
it
is
very
cloudy
and
golden
with
a
white
head
it
smells
like
banana
laffy
taffy
with
some
spice
it
is
very
drinkable
and
it
has
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
the
only
thing
that
is
bad
about
this
beer
is
that
it
costs
4
50
for
a
single
500ml
bottle
very
good
though
overall
i
would
be
happy
to
have
another
creamy
and
soft
with
a
faily
light
body
and
high
drinkability
d
very
nice
drinkability
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
another
great
beer
from
ayinger
loved
the
label
as
well
one
of
the
best
wbocks
ive
had
if
not
the
best
pours
a
cloudy
dull
orangish
color
with
off
white
head
that
stays
aloft
for
quite
some
time
smells
as
a
good
weizenbock
should
sweet
banana
and
clove
with
wheat
and
maybe
a
touch
of
vanilla
i
think
i
get
a
touch
of
alcohol
on
the
nose
taste
is
earthy
with
the
same
attributes
as
the
nose
a
very
nice
weizenbock
body
is
lightmedium
and
mouthfeel
is
very
active
carb
yet
fairly
smooth
some
creaminess
in
the
carbonation
overall
one
of
the
top
3
weizenbocks
very
drinkable
and
well
done
enjoyable
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
as
far
as
the
style
goes
worth
your
time
d
the
500ml
serving
size
is
no
problem
with
this
one
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
more
substantial
that
your
typical
hefe
this
is
the
way
to
go
probably
the
best
example
ive
had
of
this
style
500ml
bottle
into
a
duvel
snifter
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
decent
frothy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
a
nice
amount
of
bananas
and
citrus
with
mild
spice
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
sweet
fruits
bananas
and
mild
spice
quite
flavorful
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
slight
warming
alcohol
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
weizenbock
one
id
certainly
have
again
this
is
a
great
beer
and
im
glad
to
have
had
this
weizenbock
pretty
fresh
its
hard
to
procure
these
imports
when
there
still
remotely
fresh
you
can
definitely
tell
the
difference
throughly
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
looking
to
see
what
a
wiezenbock
taste
like
especially
while
its
pretty
fresh

weizenbock
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
got
to
have
this
and
victorys
variation
within
two
nights
of
each
other
wish
theyd
have
this
style
around
more
d
very
drinkable
i
venture
to
say
these
would
be
just
as
pleasing
in
the
summer
time
a
quality
weizenbock
without
a
doubt
looks
like
its
time
for
another
in
the
same
vein
as
vitus
this
is
a
pale
style
weizenbock
also
in
the
same
vein
its
worth
seeking
out
im
not
sure
if
aging
would
be
a
good
plan
to
get
rid
of
the
alcohol
but
its
really
not
that
hard
to
live
with
as
is
very
flavorful
and
recommended
flavor
is
pleasant
and
rich
in
clove
and
bubblegum
a
touch
of
alcohol
heat
that
i
find
attractive
well
done
d
this
is
a
true
german
weizenbock
because
it
is
more
weizen
than
bock
it
is
very
delicious
and
a
bargain
at
less
than
5
edit
i
havent
done
a
pale
weizenbock
comparison
yet
but
i
did
do
a
sidebyside
with
aventinus
and
this
brew
probably
does
have
more
depth
even
if
i
do
like
the
chocolate
flavors
from
aventinus
id
dare
say
this
beer
might
be
better
than
i
thought
a
pour
orange
pour
that
is
quite
cloudy
translucent
at
best
nice
tight
head
candied
citrus
for
a
nose
pineapple
and
cotton
candy
palate
that
is
wonderful
creamy
but
also
very
refreshing
this
density
gets
more
prominent
when
the
beer
warms
palate
as
their
hef
with
a
boat
load
of
bready
protein
and
crisp
floral
on
the
tongue
that
cleans
all
the
density
off
marzipan
and
chamomile
honey
and
lavender
great
beer
could
be
had
any
day
of
the
week
as
a
large
amount
of
nearly
musky
wheat
malt
i
would
to
say
some
the
the
best
body
around
d
highly
drinkable
but
i
have
a
hard
time
thinking
of
this
as
a
weizenbock
would
not
be
opposed
to
having
again
more
along
the
lines
of
the
weihenstephaner
vitus
than
aventinus
drinkability
as
a
wheat
beer
this
is
quite
good
and
different
from
the
brauweisse
from
the
same
brewery
while
i
like
this
beer
i
think
i
prefer
my
wezienbocks
a
bit
darker
and
with
a
more
complex
character
e
g
aventinus
and
moonglow
nonetheless
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
a
treat
to
drink
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
given
the
choice
of
german
brewed
weizenbocks
i
think
id
opt
for
the
aventinus
500ml
bottle
served
in
a
weizen
glass
bottle
conditioned
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
three
fingers
of
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
per
style
nice
mix
of
clove
and
banana
in
the
aroma
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
good
and
spicy
with
clove
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
well
hidden
very
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
classic
rendition
of
a
weizenbock
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
its
hard
to
not
be
a
fan
of
a
beer
this
good
its
not
terribly
complex
but
all
of
the
flavors
hold
their
own
and
have
a
good
amount
of
pop
well
worth
a
shot
note
weizenbocks
are
among
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
damn
near
perfection
amazing
ayinger
deven
though
this
beer
is
7
1
abv
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
highly
suggest
this
beer
to
anyone
who
loves
craft
beer
d
very
drinkable
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
hard
to
tell
that
it
is
7
good
summer
beer
excellent
drinkability
pours
a
super
cloudy
dirty
orange
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
into
a
solid
cap
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
malt
some
metal
banana
clove
lemon
and
tart
apples
the
taste
is
of
clove
bananas
bubble
gum
a
hint
of
berry
fruitiness
the
malt
takes
a
slap
to
the
wheat
edge
and
makes
it
sit
down
as
it
warms
there
is
a
light
lemon
edge
nice
concentrated
hefe
flavors
solid
moderate
feel
tingly
carbonation
sits
well
and
finishes
awesomely
terrific
a
touch
sweet
very
smooth
feel
velvty
a
very
fantastic
brew
a
hefe
on
roids
this
is
very
good
and
you
must
seek
this
out
pours
a
very
cloudy
orange
into
my
weizen
glass
with
hard
pour
it
takes
three
tries
to
fill
up
the
glass
with
a
nice
white
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
too
long
the
aroma
is
what
i
expect
from
a
well
built
wheat
beer
with
aromas
of
bready
bananas
and
spice
the
flavor
reflects
the
smell
banana
clove
but
a
bit
hot
from
the
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
for
a
beer
that
is
7
1
alcohol
i
wasnt
expecting
it
and
wouldnt
be
able
to
pick
it
out
if
you
didnt
tell
me
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
go
back
to
on
occasion
brauweisse
is
my
1
beer
and
this
certainly
reflects
a
stronger
version
of
that
classic
overall
solid
weizenbock
drinkable
hardly
taste
the
slightly
higher
abv
which
is
always
a
good
thing
pours
a
hazy
golden
peach
with
a
creamy
white
head
nose
has
wheat
tropical
fruits
spicy
yeast
and
cloves
taste
is
quite
fruity
yet
well
balanced
by
the
bready
malts
and
peppery
yeast
crisp
refreshing
body
is
well
carbonated
another
great
beer
from
ayinger
this
is
a
great
wheat
beer
for
the
winter
proves
you
can
have
it
year
round
for
all
those
naysayers
out
there
d
this
is
a
fantastic
weizenbock
wish
i
had
more
of
these
its
like
their
brauweiss
but
a
bit
more
bready
malty
complexity
going
on
500ml
poured
a
cloudy
and
opaque
deep
yellow
color
with
a
nice
tall
white
head
retention
was
decent
but
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
sweet
and
full
of
wheat
banana
clove
and
yeast
with
some
scents
of
grainy
maltiness
as
well
tastes
are
very
similar
to
the
aromas
banana
clove
wheat
but
also
has
some
vanilla
notes
and
is
rather
sweet
on
the
palate
especially
on
the
finish
alcohol
is
faint
but
noticeable
seems
more
estery
but
doesnt
seem
to
reveal
any
sort
of
fruity
notes
that
i
guess
i
expected
like
others
in
this
style
category
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
while
being
creamy
and
smooth
overall
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
with
this
offering
dont
get
me
wrong
it
was
still
good
but
i
would
tend
to
lean
towards
others
in
this
style
if
given
the
choice
this
one
seemed
a
little
too
weissey
and
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
drinkability
is
good
it
went
down
easily
i
think
i
prefer
aventinus
but
this
was
good
recommended
taste
is
high
quality
hefe
bananas
citrus
yeast
bread
and
spice
everywhere
with
excellent
carbonated
bite
at
the
end
alcohol
is
not
apparent
this
taste
like
a
regular
good
german
wheat
beer
you
would
never
know
it
has
the
high
alcohol
a
fine
offering
poured
into
a
large
spaten
weizenshaped
glass
with
a
handle
murky
orange
with
a
fluffy
cap
resting
on
the
surface
at
least
a
3
finger
head
pouring
the
yeast
in
gives
it
a
soupy
weizenbock
opacity
clove
in
the
nose
with
the
standard
ayinger
hefe
yeast
a
little
phenolic
with
a
trace
of
banana
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
and
bready
more
clove
spice
than
banana
in
this
one
leaning
more
towards
hefe
than
a
supercharged
weizenbock
like
aventinus
still
its
very
clean
and
refreshing
overall
id
try
it
again
its
a
nice
fall
beer
poured
into
my
celebrator
glass
a
very
nice
cloudy
darker
yellow
color
very
nice
carbonation
with
a
huge
onefinger
plus
creamy
white
head
lots
of
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
yeasty
very
nice
notes
of
spicebannanascloves
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
sweet
yeasty
with
some
bannanasclove
notes
medium
body
drinkable
a
very
tasty
brew
cloudy
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
sitting
on
top
lots
of
carbonation
bubbling
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
got
the
typical
banana
clove
and
bubblegum
along
with
that
hint
of
pepper
that
other
reviewers
have
mentioned
clove
simply
dominates
the
taste
for
me
then
the
banana
kicks
in
this
is
really
good
malty
sweetness
is
there
but
very
moderate
to
me
it
was
everything
good
about
a
weizen
just
more
of
it
also
has
a
richer
feel
than
a
regular
weizen
its
really
hard
to
believe
this
has
a
7
1abv
drinkability
is
scary
this
stuff
is
fantastic
overall
a
fantastic
weizen
bock
again
this
is
on
the
wheat
end
of
the
spectrum
for
sure
but
thats
how
i
like
em
an
excellent
beer
that
any
wheat
beer
fan
should
never
pass
up
will
be
going
back
to
the
store
to
stock
up
on
these
bad
boys
tomorrow
great
beer
firmly
in
my
top
5
for
weizenbocks
without
question
this
is
a
good
beer
and
follows
the
style
something
that
is
worth
a
try
drinkability
besides
the
aventinus
offering
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
weizenbocks
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
having
i
love
how
spicy
the
aromas
and
the
actual
taste
are
and
it
really
shows
off
true
weizen
properties
with
an
excellent
showing
of
bubblegumbanana
like
elemenets
at
3
25
and
7
1
abv
this
is
not
only
a
bargain
its
a
steal
grab
this
while
you
can
f
actually
i
couldnt
quite
tell
that
this
was
a
7
beer
it
tasted
strong
but
not
that
strong
this
is
a
delicious
and
very
drinkable
beer
man
am
i
glad
aying
is
shipping
this
one
to
the
states
as
this
is
just
a
really
fantastic
beer
very
drinkable
id
have
one
on
a
mild
summer
day
anytime
as
expected
ayinger
delivers
another
knockout
overall
a
wonderful
experiment
from
schells
i
like
the
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
added
to
a
weizen
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
an
experimental
concoction
that
is
interesting
yet
disappointing
oh
well
nice
try
at
a
style
i
know
schell
can
crush
if
they
so
desire
overall
beer
3
from
the
schell
weiss
mixer
i
was
most
looking
forward
to
this
beer
because
i
absolutely
loved
the
2010
schell
snowstorm
weizenbock
unfortunately
i
did
not
enjoy
this
nearly
as
much
it
was
kind
of
all
over
the
place
and
light
on
what
i
enjoy
in
weizenbocks
lots
of
banana
heavyness
sweetness
interesting
but
a
little
disappointing
poured
this
into
the
schell
hexbase
weisse
glass
slightly
cloudy
golden
liquid
with
a
large
fluff
of
white
head
that
displayed
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
was
yeastdominant
notes
of
banana
and
clove
as
would
be
expected
toasted
wheat
citrus
zest
taste
was
on
the
dull
side
bland
pale
malts
and
toasted
wheat
bready
yeast
banana
and
clove
slight
sugary
sweetness
damp
compost
not
too
bad
for
the
style
but
i
wasnt
really
feeling
it
seemed
old
lightmedium
body
a
bit
harsh
in
the
mouthfeel
not
terrible
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
want
anymore
than
a
single
serving
the
bock
part
of
this
is
background
and
it
presents
as
more
of
a
bigger
weizen
and
from
that
feels
more
summer
like
than
winter
like
some
hop
presence
with
a
green
taste
and
feel
in
the
finish
and
lingering
soft
fruit
flavors
show
eg
orange
shows
in
time
but
to
me
they
are
in
the
background
to
the
spiciness
of
the
yeast
good
experiment
it
teeters
between
sublime
and
awful
that
it
is
i
wouldnt
call
this
horrible
but
it
is
not
real
spotone
for
style
and
i
expect
a
german
type
brewery
to
be
spoton
and
not
push
the
boundaries
in
new
ways
its
ok
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
if
offered
in
sixpacks
or
whatever
i
know
what
i
like
in
this
style
and
this
interpretation
does
not
do
it
for
me
funny
as
i
love
the
heck
out
of
their
hefe
overall
pretty
dry
and
hoppy
for
a
weizenbock
this
is
certainly
not
typical
of
the
style
but
like
the
augusts
bock
they
made
last
fall
i
like
the
use
of
nontraditional
hops
in
a
traditional
german
beer
i
hope
the
average
goes
up
for
this
one
because
i
dont
think
many
people
get
what
was
intended
here
overall
a
lighter
weizenbock
in
my
opinion
easy
to
drink
and
good
for
the
summer
a
bit
dry
for
me
however
very
underwhelmed
with
this
beer
i
know
schells
can
produce
a
weizenbock
so
not
sure
why
this
was
not
that
good

i
know
left
hand
just
won
a
bunch
of
medals
today
at
gabf
but
this
is
not
their
strongest
effort
2011
vintage
looks
cloudy
redbrown
and
mostly
flat
with
that
wheat
malt
lace
we
are
all
familiar
with
my
girlfriend
thinks
it
smells
like
slim
jim
i
am
thinking
it
smells
like
slightly
higher
quality
cured
meat
but
smoky
salty
and
fleshy
for
sure
now
that
i
think
of
it
it
smells
a
lot
like
the
cured
beef
i
ate
in
bosnia
all
summer
last
year
nothing
about
this
tells
me
its
beer
the
flavor
is
also
particularly
wholesome
protein
is
evident
here
salty
again
too
really
just
downright
meaty
i
dont
get
anything
as
far
as
malt
or
hops
or
yeast
maybe
some
lazy
lager
yeast
on
the
back
end
and
some
alcohol
but
this
is
a
miss
on
just
about
all
counts
i
dont
dislike
it
but
the
flavor
is
a
far
cry
from
the
style
guidelines
and
it
just
really
doesnt
work
for
me
fall
notes
but
thats
too
little
too
late
that
its
seasonally
appropriate
this
is
a
mess
all
over
the
place
so
many
left
hand
bombers
have
been
but
i
appreciate
the
spirit
of
experimentation
that
courses
through
most
of
them
skip
this
if
its
even
still
around
nailed
the
color
small
amount
of
lace
and
a
very
thin
beige
head
present
with
an
aggressive
pour
smell
is
where
this
shines
for
me
smoke
smoke
smoke
this
is
a
rauchbier
their
is
also
a
black
tea
and
soy
sauce
smell
integrated
nicely
with
the
strong
smokiness
taste
is
soy
sauce
moderate
smoke
mild
sweetness
and
light
black
tea
flavors
nice
this
was
a
unique
yet
well
executed
project
by
lefthand
and
the
age
has
helped
this
beer
bleah
first
left
hand
beer
ive
had
at
home
and
only
the
second
ive
ever
tasted
i
tried
their
milk
stout
at
the
acbf
in
boston
last
year
and
enjoyed
it
so
i
know
theyre
capable
of
good
stuff
best
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
with
this
one
guys
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
no
head
or
lace
color
is
a
very
dark
clear
brown
red
aroma
is
roast
smoke
tea
malt
flavors
like
nose
carbonic
tang
is
up
front
followed
by
smokey
sweet
and
some
tart
followed
by
some
bitter
in
the
finish
body
is
ok
carbonation
is
a
bit
fizzy
finish
is
like
flavor
long
in
the
smoke
and
not
that
good
im
dumping
the
rest
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
meaty
smoke
in
it
as
well
as
some
wheat
notes
the
flavor
is
also
very
meaty
tasting
with
some
banana
and
clove
notes
mixed
in
i
also
get
some
wheat
as
well
as
some
ash
and
charcoal
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
not
bad
but
i
wish
the
smoke
was
turned
down
a
bit
and
the
weizenbock
notes
were
more
prevalent
i
like
the
smokey
smell
and
taste
but
the
other
tastes
and
texture
are
just
not
fitting
together
for
me
worth
trying
if
only
for
its
uniqueness
i
cant
say
i
love
this
and
i
cant
say
i
hate
it
but
its
different
and
worth
trying
my
other
beverage
interest
is
tea
and
i
find
the
lapsang
souchong
flavor
too
strong
even
in
tea
and
adding
it
to
beer
the
intense
flavor
just
sticks
out
im
a
big
fan
of
weirdness
in
beer
ingredients
but
not
when
theyre
dosed
with
a
heavy
hand
feels
full
in
body
a
little
chewy
and
a
little
oily
for
me
a
c
brew
and
thats
being
more
than
generous
overall
interesting
to
try
but
not
one
i
would
probably
buy
again
it
has
some
interesting
flavors
nice
tea
like
and
the
smoke
starts
nice
but
gets
a
bit
overwhelming
the
biggest
problem
with
the
beer
is
that
the
beer
itself
malts
etc
play
a
background
role
in
this
beer
its
more
about
the
smoke
and
tea
than
weizendoppelbock
at
all
for
which
the
flavors
are
very
subtle
and
hard
to
get
to
behind
the
heavy
smoke
and
tea
i
like
the
idea
but
please
tone
those
components
down
a
bit
and
try
again
the
tannins
start
to
get
a
bit
heavy
and
combine
with
the
smoked
char
and
bitterness
to
bring
a
slightly
unpleasant
feel
as
well
this
beer
really
brings
out
the
smoke
when
paired
with
smoked
meats
this
is
a
wild
beer
definitely
worth
trying
once
dont
know
if
i
would
go
back
for
another
round
overall
i
really
liked
this
on
tap
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
a
nitro
tap
this
was
a
fresh
batch
just
on
tap
so
it
was
crisp
and
clean
i
bought
2
bottles
to
bring
home
and
cellar
1
in
6
months
and
1
in
a
year
overall
i
liked
this
one
more
than
i
thought
i
would
as
i
watched
it
fill
my
glass
and
begin
to
fill
the
air
with
the
aroma
of
a
backyard
bbq
not
an
everyday
beer
obviously
but
a
must
try
interesting
twist
on
the
style
the
smoke
character
is
bold
and
has
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
to
balance
i
only
noticed
the
black
tea
on
the
aftertaste
try
it
for
something
different
phenolic
peaty
smoke
and
a
dripping
spoonful
of
diacetyl
im
sorry
but
ive
wasted
enough
time
on
left
hand
brews
to
give
them
an
indepth
review
i
havent
had
one
in
several
years
and
see
they
are
still
really
poorly
made
the
body
is
kind
of
watery
in
spite
of
the
jarring
flavors
and
the
finish
vapid
fail
i
can
very
easily
see
how
some
people
here
could
hate
this
on
one
hand
its
kinda
like
an
inbred
cousin
of
a
rauchbier
but
personally
although
the
flavor
combination
is
weird
i
kinda
dig
it
but
i
have
a
great
appreciation
for
outofthebox
thinking
this
probably
isnt
something
ill
buy
again
but
im
also
not
a
huge
fan
of
malty
lager
styles
to
begin
with
but
if
this
sounds
intriguing
to
you
id
recommend
trying
it
once
for
sure
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
had
this
beer
from
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
because
of
the
smokey
element
poured
into
a
pint
glass
right
away
the
smell
hits
you
in
the
face
leather
smoke
burnt
tar
not
a
good
combination
the
taste
was
overwhelming
fake
liquid
smoke
to
me
i
couldnt
get
passed
the
leather
burnt
soy
sauce
fake
liquid
smoke
taste
of
this
beer
i
dumped
it
and
i
can
count
on
one
hand
how
many
times
ive
dumped
a
beer
not
good
always
looking
for
something
with
smokey
accents
so
i
was
happy
to
find
this
on
the
shelves
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
deep
dark
brown
looks
like
bog
water
initially
presents
with
a
deep
beige
head
but
that
quickly
faded
leaving
just
a
light
film
on
top
smell
is
hard
to
pin
down
definitely
some
smoke
with
a
hint
of
soy
sauce
and
tea
leaves
on
tasting
this
beer
my
taste
buds
were
just
as
confused
as
my
nose
had
been
the
smokey
flavor
is
just
off
rather
than
getting
that
great
smoke
campfire
quality
that
elicits
fond
memories
of
camping
with
friendsfamily
i
get
a
smoke
quality
of
cheap
cigar
ash
that
has
been
left
out
a
long
time
their
is
a
soy
sauce
thing
in
the
taste
as
well
but
its
like
it
had
been
left
in
the
sauce
pan
and
got
burnt
the
tea
aspects
on
this
beer
create
this
background
flavor
that
seems
like
dark
fruit
that
is
past
its
time
the
mouthfeel
doesnt
help
because
the
carbonation
seems
low
making
this
a
thicker
mess
to
have
to
get
down
overall
i
was
really
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
know
left
hand
can
make
a
good
beer
with
smokey
elements
because
i
really
enjoyed
their
fade
to
black
vol
2
porter
this
one
just
didnt
work
overall
this
is
quite
an
interesting
brew
and
coincidentally
very
similar
to
one
i
planned
on
trying
to
homebrew
one
day
mouthfeel
light
body
and
just
cloying
from
the
oversweetness
glad
i
had
a
imperial
stout
to
get
it
out
of
my
mouth
pleasant
enough
but
the
bbq
mesquite
quality
seems
out
of
balance
and
becomes
a
bit
too
dominant
after
a
while
no
no
no
hard
to
finish
this
beer
split
a
bomber
thank
god
i
shared
poured
dark
brown
with
an
average
frothy
brown
head
that
lasted
with
good
lacing
moderate
roasted
malt
wet
wood
and
horrible
smoke
aroma
medium
body
with
a
smooth
texture
and
light
carbonation
medium
smoked
sweet
flavor
with
a
medium
smooth
sweet
finish
some
tastes
i
cant
pin
point
maybe
its
the
tea
bad
combination
no
balance
by
far
left
hands
worst
brew
i
have
an
imperial
stout
from
them
next
stay
tuned
thick
body
and
creamy
smooth
in
the
middle
a
little
bitter
on
the
finish
a
definite
sipper
nothing
that
made
me
want
to
buy
another
overall
this
was
very
disappointing
a
weizenbock
made
with
tarry
schong
tea
made
me
excited
for
a
complex
smokey
wheat
beer
but
its
kind
of
a
one
dimensional
mess
o
out
of
this
world
good
i
cannot
think
of
any
beer
in
which
i
have
had
recently
that
has
unique
i
really
dig
this
and
would
absolutely
buy
again
awesome
offering
overall
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
i
think
the
classification
in
which
this
beer
is
placed
might
throw
people
off
it
definitely
is
more
reminiscent
of
a
rauchbier
with
some
added
strange
qualities
this
is
still
enjoyable
to
me
notes
not
to
style
and
liking
it
quite
a
bit
for
that
provocative
use
of
the
lapsang
souchong
tea
providing
and
assertive
smoked
edge
and
a
very
sweet
range
which
sure
is
not
going
to
be
for
any
palate
i
would
not
mind
keeping
one
of
this
around
for
the
right
occasion
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
smoke
flavor
that
is
unique
and
very
pleasant
just
very
little
malt
or
hop
character
to
support
it
the
smoke
and
esters
from
the
hefe
yeast
are
a
bit
odd
together
lapsang
souchong
bubblegum
wow
this
one
is
an
interesting
offering
im
not
really
sure
where
to
start
the
peat
smoked
malt
aroma
and
flavor
is
quite
intriguing
however
it
created
a
lot
of
offflavors
in
areas
that
warranted
more
attention
one
to
pass
on
this
is
not
the
bets
weizenbock
i
have
had
in
good
part
because
the
smell
borders
on
offputting
yet
overall
this
is
delicious
and
accessible
despite
its
flaws
strong
and
smooth
left
handwhich
is
historically
very
hitandmiss
with
mehas
hit
close
to
the
mark
with
tnt
a
solid
flavorful
beer
well
worth
trying
drinkable
i
will
say
that
o
i
really
liked
this
one
as
an
end
of
the
day
sipping
beer
watching
tv
and
relaxing
with
the
wife
m
medium
to
heavybodied
definitely
a
sipper
but
well
worth
trying
if
you
enjoy
smoked
beers
o
just
try
it
once
half
a
pint
if
you
can
if
you
hate
it
at
least
you
can
marinate
your
steaks
in
it
definitely
an
experience
in
the
world
of
weird
maybe
shouldnt
have
been
released
beers
o
the
flavors
were
too
complicated
it
seemed
to
be
a
little
bit
all
over
the
place
but
the
driver
was
smoked
flavor
i
drink
smoked
beer
as
i
lived
in
bamberg
for
a
few
years
but
this
one
just
does
not
hit
on
the
notes
id
like
which
is
clear
direction
in
a
flavor
the
taste
is
liquid
bbq
smokey
wood
and
smoked
roasted
malt
with
some
odd
fruity
flavors
splashing
the
middle
of
the
palate
if
i
were
to
blind
taste
this
beer
i
would
not
think
it
was
a
bock
of
any
kind
or
contained
wheat
or
tea
for
that
matter
this
beer
did
not
taste
at
all
like
a
weizenbock
was
an
interetsing
drink
nonethe
less
and
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
fans
of
rauchbier
or
smokey
flavors
a
weizen
dopplebock
with
tea
pours
a
hazy
very
dark
brown
with
fizzy
tan
head
fades
to
a
thin
ring
leaving
nothing
on
the
glass
smell
smoky
roasted
grain
cola
fruity
caramelized
sugar
smells
good
but
pretty
far
afield
for
a
weizenbock
kind
of
almost
works
for
a
dopplebock
taste
i
have
the
same
reaction
to
room
temperature
day
old
coffee
which
this
tastes
like
to
some
degree
also
cola
grainy
some
kind
of

didnt

sweaty
not

average
mouthfeel
d
this
was
a
very
unique
and
interesting
fusion
of
flavors
in
a
combination
i
never
would
have
imagined
not
sure
i
loved
it
but
it
was
fun
to
try
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
so
it
was
reasonably
easy
to
drink
definitely
recommended
to
try
once
just
for
the
experience
but
probably
not
more
than
that
it
had
a
decent
mouthfeel
smooth
for
the
most
part
but
all
the
smokiness
left
my
palette
feeling
kinda
overwhelmed
after
a
while
kept
rinsing
it
with
water
to
get
a
better
feel
for
the
beer
very
interesting
very
different
worth
tasting
once
not
sure
i
would
get
it
again
very
spicy
smoked
flavor
is
dominant
d
pretty
drinkable
the
smokiness
is
rather
heavy
handed
but
at
the
same
time
kinda
works
the
other
flavors
could
have
been
a
bot
more
robust
to
compensate
that
being
said
it
is
a
nice
twist
for
a
darkweizen
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
a
light
touch
of
carbonation
slick
on
the
tongue
and
a
little
tart
in
the
finish
from
the
fruity
flavors
after
awhile
the
smoke
flavor
loses
its
novelty
and
becomes
more
of
a
liquid
smoke
fakeness
that
i
wish
tasted
more
peat
scotch
like
overall
a
decent
beer
that
you
would
expect
from
left
hand
but
it
falls
flat
worth
a
try
but
i
cant
see
buying
more
then
one
ever
d
they
just
tried
too
much
if
they
left
out
some
of
the
rauch
malt
this
might
have
been
a
super
interesting
beer
but
it
worked
against
everything
else
going
on
i
recommend
exposing
this
brew
to
ambient
conditions
for
minimum
of
one
hour
before
truly
reviewing
taste
tnt
fridge
cold
then
taste
after
the
time
period
has
elapsed
you
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
and
amazed
i
am
new
to
this
style
but
if
this
beer
is
anything
like
others
in
this
genre
than
i
would
definitely
like
to
try
more
of
them
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
opinion
i
am
normally
a
pretty
big
fan
of
what
left
hand
does
but
this
beer
has
left
me
guessing
i
am
not
sure
what
they
were
going
for
here
except
for
a
reason
for
a
collaborative
effort
with
their
local
coffee
shop
perhaps
this
is
their
offering
to
compete
with
lagunitas
cappuccino
stout
if
so
they
missed
the
boat
at
least
the
beer
is
getting
sweeter
as
it
warms
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
going
to
be
able
to
finish
this
one
i
think
that
this
will
be
the
first
left
hand
beer
that
i
have
pitched
but
it
is
just
not
doing
it
for
me
sorry
left
hand
maybe
your
next
one
overall
i
was
a
little
worried
reading
the
other
reviews
thankfully
i
think
theyre
a
bit
harsh
this
is
an
interesting
beer
rich
smokey
flavors
with
a
subtle
sweet
tea
underside
i
liked
it
this
is
not
something
i
enjoy
i
dont
understand
were
the
tea
comes
into
play
here
because
i
get
nothing
and
way
to
much
smoke
a
very
harsh
beer
not
a
weisenbock
at
all
and
not
very
pleasant
i
would
not
recommend
it
o
this
beer
is
probably
getting
knocked
too
much
for
what
it
is
a
heavy
smoke
beer
i
applaud
left
hand
for
trying
something
new
in
the
way
of
smoke
beers
and
i
will
gladly
buy
this
again
because
i
personally
like
it
also
this
is
certainly
not
deserving
of
the
poor
ratings
it
is
getting
similar
to
that
of
ba
wake
up
dead
overall
i
think
i
liked
the
idea
much
better
than
i
liked
the
actual
beer
aroma
is
smoky
and
yeasty
with
a
malty
undertone
and
a
firm
hint
of
caramel
it
pours
a
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
respectable
if
not
persistent
light
tan
head
flavor
is
yeasty
smoky
and
malty
with
a
caramel
undertone
and
a
fruity
hint
could
there
be
a
bit
of
raspberry
in
there
texture
is
smooth
and
nicely
fizzy
leaving
a
fruity
tingle
behind
d
an
interesting
beer
that
isnt
quite
of
its
style
but
is
still
drinkable
o
this
is
interesting
it
helps
knowing
that
this
tea
is
smoked
do
not
drink
this
thinking
you
are
getting
a
traditional
weizenbock
overall
not
a
good
combination
not
pleasant
will
likely
be
a
drain
pour
overall
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
wish
id
gone
with
the
house
beer
for
half
the
price
not
to
mention
its
sweetwater
ipa
interesting
but
not
worth
seeking
out
not
very
impressed
sounded
interesting
and
it
is
interesting
but
overall
its
totally
not
for
me
and
not
something
i
would
drink
again
a
little
overcarbonated
which
actually
helps
keep
the
smoke
flavor
off
the
palate
and
allows
some
of
the
raisin
and
banana
still
not
an
overall
great
effort
pretty
weird
for
the
style
and
not
in
a
good
way
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
super
chewy
this
could
be
a
meal
in
of
itself
however
a
full
22
oz
bottle
is
pushing
the
limits
the
bacon
character
was
a
little
offputting
at
first
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
as
the
beer
warms
flavors
mellow
out
and
it
is
more
approachable
not
completely
blown
away
so
maybe
only
a
quarter
stick
kind
of
mixed
feelings
about
this
i
like
the
smokiness
of
the
beer
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
tea
flavor
which
seems
to
me
thins
the
beer
out
a
lot
hmmm
some
good
elements
and
some
really
odd
ones
had
this
one
on
tap
this
evening
at
hops
pie
in
the
highland
neighborhood
in
north
denver
i
had
considered
purchasing
a
bottle
for
a
few
seconds
the
other
day
but
passed
glad
i
did
medium
brown
color
with
a
scant
offwhite
head
aromas
of
light
smoke
dark
raisins
bananas
and
wheat
similar
on
the
palate
but
hidden
behind
an
overwhelming
and
unpleasant
smokiness
use
your
wallet
trust
me
close
it
to
coup
this
beer
out
of
rotation
it
is
worth
noting
that
it
can
be
redeemed
by
a
pepperoncini
pairing
the
spiciness
of
the
pepper
quells
the
sweetness
of
the
taste
watching
opening
day
baseball
with
a
few
beershopefully
the
tigers
can
get
a
win
against
the
fg

a

in

and
phenols
dominate
the

spicy
and
yeastythe
smoke
seems
to
be
a

off
the
beer
started
out
promising
but
did
fizzle
out
a
little
when
came
to
flavor
and
feeli
think
its
a
little
heavy
handed
in
the
yeast
departmentthe
tea
didnt
play
a
big
role
on
the
palate
for
me
until
the
beer
warmed
a
little
and
it
didnt
really
cut
thru
the
phenols
bottled
on

overall
just
not
what
a
beer
should
be
the
idea
was
very
intriguing
but
ultimately
a
failure
how
did
this
make
its
way
into
distribution
overall
interesting
for
anybody
who
really
enjoys
wheat
beers
this
will
be
a

ive
never
had
a

the

caught
some

on

end
didnt

anything

there
is
a

in
there
but
its
a

wreck
im
sure
some
will
laud
over
its
complexity
but
this
is
not
complex
this
is
an

great

domestic

go
extreme
with
this

this
is
completely

really
enjoyable
beer
this
beer
poured
out
darker
than
i
thought
it
would
the
color
was
a
murky
brown
with
a
pretty
nice
looking
bubbly
head
on
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
of
strong
malts
and
some
wheat
in
the
background
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
slight
acidic
bitterness
to
it
up
front
possibly
from
the
dark
malts
used
the
aftertaste
though
was
a
smooth
wheat
flavor
that
i
found
to
be
quite
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
pretty
good
pours
a
lightly
hazed
a
murky
dark
brown
good
creamkahki

scent
is
quite
a

like

notes
of
blackened

light

fruityness
mingles
with

grainy

begins
with
quite
a
taste
of
tartness
that
was
unexpected
from
scent
behind
the
tartness
one
can
pick
up
the
wonderful
components
of
scent
but
slightly
washed
out
in
the
finnish
by
an
odd
medicinal
sassafrasroot
beer
barrel
candy
note
as
i
sip
the
taste
becomes
more
cohesive
and
works
quite
nicely
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
undrinkable
at
first
medium
bodied
light
grainyness
on
the
palate
slightly
dry
i
thought
i
was
going
to
love
this
beer
then
i
thought
i
was
going
to
hate
it
and
then
in
the
end
i
ended
up
mostly
liking
it
oddly
enough
wish
i
had
another
glass
at
home
so
i
could
sit
and
think
about
it
some
more
cheers
very
dark
brown
in
color
tan
foam
and
a
slight
reddish
hue
the
beer
is
appealing
the
smell
is
nice
chocolate
vanilla
and
raisinbread
nice
stuff
following
the
first
few
sips
a
lot
of
spicy
phenols
come
out
the
beer
is
semisweet
and
has
a
pleasant
alcohol
warming
a
bit
yeasty
chocolate
and
vanilla
in
the
flavor
mediumfull
in
body
with
notable
carbonation
this
is
a
satisfying
beer
although
it
could
be
a
bit
more
intense
in
its
characteristics
overall
not
overly
extreem
a
solid
a
example
of
the
style
the
toasty
flavors
of
malt
are
quite
advance
and
distinguish
the
beer
would
certainly
reccommend
another
fine
beer
from
mahrs
this
brewery
can
seemingly
do
no
wrong
o
do
yourself
a
favor
buy
this
beer
and
enjoy
it
d
i
found
this
weizenbock
to
be
quite
one
dimensional
and
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
palette
it
does
a
good
job
of
hiding
its
abv
albeit
without
much
complexity
i
will
easily
finish
the
bottle
but
doubt
i
will
ever
pick
this
one
up
again
a
decent
beer
but
one
of
the
least
interesting
weizenbocks
i
have
had
the
chance
to
try
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
brew
we
detected
little
wheat
character
and
it
was
darker
and
sweeter
than
the
average
weizenbock
it
was
actually
more
like
a
light
doppelbock
d
for
the
most
part
the
alcohol
is
relatively
well
masked
although
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
sipped
d
one
of
the
best
example
of
the
weizenbock
style
ive
tried
in
a
while
drinkable
d
this
is
a
very
solid
weizenbock
im
glad
it
arrived
in
mo
because
this
is
a
style
id
love
to
see
more
often
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
there
is
also
suspended
sediment
present
23
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
good
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
dark
citrus
slight
hop
and
some
acidity
fits
the
style
of
a
weizenbock
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
slight
dark
citrus
slight
tartness
and
slight
grain
overall
a
good
body
but
high
carbonation
hurts
the
feel
pours
a
caramel
like
color
and
in
fact
reminds
me
of
cola
in
many
ways
thin
to
no
head
is
there
upon
pour
and
a
few
moments
afterwards
disappointing
nose
has
a
dark
breadlike
character
rather
yeasty
chocolatey
on
the
taste
easy
drinking
much
like
a
plain
ole
dunkel
or
dunkleweizen
i
would
order
it
again
and
recommend
it
overall
this
was
a
much
more
carameloriented
weizenbock
than
most
others
that
ive
had
dont
expect
loads
of
spices
and
bananas
in
this
one
however
it
remains
worthy
of
a
shot
pours
a
bubbly
body
dark
brow
sedement
floating
everywhere
lots
of
carbonation
smells
like
a
malty
german
wheat
beer
i
was
hoping
for
some
smoked
malt
the
flavor
is
a
bit
off
i
know
my
store
may
be
selling
old
stuff
from
other
german
imports
i
have
bought
this
flavor
has
a
tangyness
and
no
balance
which
i
belive
is
uncharacteristic
for
the
style
so
i
am
not
going
to
give
this
beer
a
full
review
because
i
belive
i
have
a
past
prime
bottle
this
product
is
a
bit
more
like
their
regular
bock
beer
than
their
weizen
and
is
quite
a
bit
different
than
aventinus
or
vitus
the
malts
used
here
are
more
earthy
and
the
grainy
bread
like
flavors
are
paramount
not
nearly
as
much
of
the
banana
clove
flavors
typical
of
regular
weizen
beers
the
use
of
weizen
yeast
is
just
noticeable
it
lightens
the
body
and
provides
just
enough
of
effervescence
to
make
this
beer
really
drinkable
d
for
an
8
5
alelager
hybrid
this
is
very
smooth
the
qualities
of
weizen
are
not
lost
but
it
has
a
very
bock
influenced
character
there
is
plenty
of
malt
and
strong
lager
flavor
for
a
cold
wet
fall
day
it
was
perfect
drinkability
a
worthy
weizenbock
not
my
1
choice
in
the
style
but
very
good
never
the
less
500ml
bottle
pours
clear
mahoganyruby
with
a
billowing
light
beige
head
hiuge
banana
and
clove
on
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
graininess
and
tang
from
the
wheat
the
wheat
character
is
much
stronger
in
the
taste
banana
and
clove
are
still
there
along
with
some
other
spice
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
which
is
surprising
slightly
roasty
dry
finish
thick
almost
creamy
feel
with
perfect
carbonation
for
the
style
this
is
great
drinks
way
too
easily
pours
a
deep
brown
with
shades
of
amber
and
a
thin
beige
head
nose
has
cloves
fresh
fruits
and
wheaty
malts
taste
is
also
quite
fruity
balanced
by
spicy
herbs
and
peppery
yeast
clean
body
is
lightly
carbonated
a
tasty
weizenbock
that
drinks
quite
easy
very
unique
not
up
there
with
aventius
or
ramstein
but
a
beer
i
would
love
to
drink
more
of
imo
this
is
more
of
a
doppelbock
with
a
wheat
backgroundfinish
similar
to
aventis
and
i
like
doppelbocks
particularly
this
type
this
was
a
new
arrival
at
our
store
so
i
decided
to
try
one
the
beer
pours
a
rich
brown
slightly
hazy
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
thake
forever
to
calm
down
aromas
at
first
were
that
of
wine
it
had
a
sour
yet
earthy
character
reminiscent
of
young
chateau
margaux
it
dominated
most
of
the
boquet
until
i
really
stuck
my
nose
into
the
glass
and
detected
the
aromas
of
the
grains
that
were
used
to
make
this
brew
the
flavor
was
amazing
fruity
yet
at
the
same
time
mellowed
out
with
sweet
caramel
and
toffee
overtones
followed
with
a
touch
of
dried
fruit
and
a
nice
dry
finish
this
beer
is
definitely
one
to
leave
its
mark
its
been
almost
five
minutes
since
my
last
sip
and
i
can
taste
it
like
it
just
came
off
my
tongue
this
was
one
unique
brew
my
standard
for
thisstyle
is
aventinus
but
i
can
almost
put
this
there
if
not
in
front
a
great
sipper
for
these
cold
winter
nights
md
the
palate
is
spritzy
upfront
slightly
loose
in
terms
of
the
bubbly
texture
while
the
flavour
is
in
a
mess
and
shows
no
gravity
i
will
pick
up
a
beer
that
actually
has
a
wheat
taste
to
it
altbocknov

flavor
is
well
layered
and
quite

texture
with
lots

caramel
and
all
going
a

direction
this
beer
is
no
different
plumbs

all
of
the
flavors
work
very
well
together
a
german
weizenbock
i
will
certainly
return
to
nehopheadfeb

but
then
again
i
always
rate
weizenbocks
against
the
unfortunately
incomparable
aventinus

for
a
january
evening
brooklyn
does
wheat
right
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
believe
this
to
be
better
than
most
real
wheat
beers
on
draft
at
the
pour
house
in
nj
a
turbid
yellow
amber
with
small
head
exceptionally
fruity
aroma
like
a
ripe
banana
attracted
a
fleet
of
fruit
flies
which
hovered
over
the
beer
the
taste
is
like
a
bananas
foster
ripe
bananas
caramelized
sugar
and
vanilla
a
smooth
and
tasty
weizenbock
but
not
one
of
the
best
available
when
consuming
a
high
abv
beer
like
this
you
should
be
blasted
with
an
explosion
of
flavor
not
a
mellow
smooth
drink
if
it
was
5
abv
it
would
be
outstanding
but
at
nearly
8
abv
it
is
just
good
an
enormous
wheat
bock
here
delicious
and
flavorful
with
a
real
sturdy
wheat
malt
base
creamy
in
texture
with
a
wonderful
banana
yeast
complexion
there
is
more
sweetness
here
than
i
like
in
the
style
incompletely
digested
by
the
yeast
which
is
so
delicious
though
dessert
banana
cream
so
nice
i
wish
it
was
a
little
dryer
the
sugar
makes
it
hard
to
drink
much
of
and
adds
more
body
than
we
need
here
a
little
vanilla
in
there
and
again
the
yeast
its
delicious
the
alcohol
comes
out
too
just
a
bit
getting
more
intense
when
it
warms
up
but
it
belons
in
the
style
i
think
at
least
a
little
brooklyn
has
a
way
of
making
their
beer
all
unique
this
is
very
them
it
fits
with
what
they
do
and
has
their
unusual
flare
to
it
although
i
think
its
far
from
perfect
stylistically
i
like
where
it
deviates
not
being
a
wheat
beer
drinker
but
i
would
rate
it
like
a
typical
belgian
with
a
banana
aftertaste
pear
must
banana
and
belgian
yeast
form
the
aroma
flavor
is
somewhat
fruity
at
the
base
with
green
apple
banana
and
pear
accompanying
a
lightly
bready
malt
backbone
fairly
flavorful
and
an
enjoyable
beer
trailing
sweetness
deepens
its
finish
and
aftertaste
with
bread
textures
and
a
delicate
rise
of
spice
mint
and
grass
with
the
mingle
of
fruit
and
clove
notions
of
bubblegum
arise
in
aftertaste
its
a
beautiful
beer
that
doesnt
exactly
capture
the
quintessential
essence
of
weizenbock
but
becomes
a
decadent
addition
to
any
session
as
an
imperial
hefeweizen
pours
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
big
foamy
2
finger
white
head
that
faded
slowly
and
left
decent
lacing
smells
of
wheat
grass
caramel
coriander
grains
and
mild
spices
initially
its
like
a
hefeweizen
but
then
turns
very
malty
tastes
of
wheat
grass
caramel
coriander
rum
toffee
grains
pepper
and
a
sweetness
like
brown
sugar
or
pumpkin
pie
surprisingly
more
flavorful
and
gets
more
complex
as
it
warms
up
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
medium
chewy
body
average
carbonation
and
a
sweet
grainy
aftertaste
that
has
a
little
touch
of
heat
overall
pretty
tasty
and
a
nice
style
that
i
normally
dont
have
id
definitely
have
this
again
would
try
again
it
just
tastes
better
than
most
beers
period
i
should
give
it
a
five
there
its
a
5
drinks
like
a
hefe
hits
like
a
weizenbock
a
top
notch
version
of
both
it
had
a
very
nice
color
like
a
hazy
bock
the
flavors
left
me
wishing
for
something
a
little
more
there
was
some
nice
spice
but
not
too
much
as
the
glass
progressed
and
warmed
up
a
bit
i
felt
it
seemed
like
it
was
missing
something
the
flavor
is
very
good
with
lots
of
wheat
malt
with
mild
banana
in
the
taste
and
light
spice
flaovrs
which
are
peppery
combined
with
the
taste
of
alcohol
in
the
background
and
slight
hop
presence
as
it
finishes
dry
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
strength
recommended
if
you
like
a
weizen
with
a
little
extra
umph
it
is
creamy
and
has
a
good
amount
of
yeast
presence
very
fruity
bottle
pours
brown
and
seemingly
hazy
small
pour
so
i
have
no
idea
how
it
looks
at
its
best
concentrated
hefe
yeast
aroma
banana
and
the
like
also
dark
malt
smells
flavor
is
wackier
than
the
nose
very
faint
hints
of
sourness
which
clearly
is
unintended
unripe
banana
caramel
wheat
plum
brown
sugar
booze
is
not
something
that
come
into
my
thoughts
while
sipping
this
beer
soft
bubbles
creamy
i
didnt
enjoy
this
750
ml
bottle
pours
dark
amber
with
white
head
aroma
is
of
funky
yeast
piney
hops
and
ripe
fruit
body
is
medium
and
smooth
plums
sour
cherries
spicy
yeast
caramel
and
herbal
hops
fill
the
mouth
finish
is
long
and
spicy
delicious
brew
d
an
interesting
brew
but
too
sweet
for
my
taste
this
one
does
improve
with
warming
though
so
be
patient
3
5
overall
this
is
going
to
get
worse
before
it
gets
better
taste
is
a
little
dank
a
bit
sweet
like
a
dopple
some
wheat
in
there
but
certainly
not
of
the
same
quality
of
many
of
its
german
counterparts
its
not
bad
its
actually
good
but
i
think
the
dank
mustiness
of
the
aroma
is
a
huge
turnoff
as
that
is
the
first
tactile
sense
one
gets
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
shared
with
kristy
k
at
the
condo
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
but
excellent
lacing
aroma
is
yeast
wheat
clove
green
apple
bubblegum
and
citrus
taste
is
classic
hefeweizen
with
clove
banana
and
bread
sweetness
plus
some
citric
hoppy
bitterness
medium
body
creamy
texture
lively
carbonation
boozy
and
phenolic
on
the
finish
still
have
one
left
in
the
cellar
but
probably
wont
let
it
sit
much
longer
after
having
had
this
one
verdict
a
nice
weizenbock
from
new
glarus
big
and
bold
with
a
lot
of
flavor
perhaps
a
bit
too
astringent
for
only
9
60
but
all
in
all
a
nice
treat
of
a
beer
that
has
aged
nicely
over
the
past
few
months
kudos
to
dan
for
this
creation
its
bold
and
hoppy
as
advertised
o
this
review
really
brought
out
all
my
adjectives
so
unique
and
tasty
like
no
other
weizenbock
ive
had
almost
perplexing
spicy
clove
smell
with
a
hint
of
cherry
lots
of
aroma
poured
cloudy
with
a
lot
of
head
very
flavorful
beer
i
dont
like
clove
in
my
beers
but
oddly
i
do
here
this
beer
is
very
tart
but
i
think
the
clove
and
hints
of
cinnamon
spice
balance
it
out
nicely
im
very
impressed
by
this
beer
wow
o
it
is
a
hoppy
version
of
a
great
style
it
reminds
me
of
schneider
hopfenweisse
yeasty
spice
with
wheat
very
creamy
mouthfeel
more
enjoyable
in
that
regard
than
vitus
almost
dangerously
drinkable
overall
new
glarus
certainly
has
a
way
with
yeast
between
this
their
dark
belgians
and
sours
you
cant
find
many
breweries
who
do
so
well
with
yeast
also
possibly
the
most
unique
twist
on
a
weizen
i
have
had
i
really
like
the
wheat
they
use
in
this
beer
and
the
yeast
qualities
are
killer
really
wished
i
could
have
tasted
this
when
it
was
fresher
o
a
slow
sipper
for
sure
im
happy
i
tried
it
as
ive
really
enjoyed
everything
else
that
ive
tried
from
new
glarus
but
this
may
have
been
tripped
up
by
the
age
i
rather
like
the
dry
effervescence
and
the
american
hop
character
that
this
distinctive
weizen
presents
its
a
rustic
and
zesty
attitude
that
resonates
through
the
session
with
sprite
and
zeal
not
your
typical
weizenbock
but
very
tasty
indeed
the
dry
hopping
is
welcomed
and
the
twist
of
tropical
and
citrus
fruit
really
works
with
the
wheat
malts
almost
giving
a
bright
lift
the
body
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
the
beer
is
beautiful
in
a
glass
this
is
a
must
try
this
is
a
weird
one
i
dont
hate
it
but
i
dont
love
it
it
is
quite
good
but
also
odd
its
a
yeasty
somewhat
sweet
malty
brew
with
a
huge
citric
quality
that
isnt
necessarily
out
of
place
but
just
really
unexpected
definitely
not
for
everyone
myself
included
pour
is
hazed
deep
amber
with
a
tight
off
white
head
leaving
a
thick
lace
nose
is
interesting
a
lightly
muddled
wheat
malt
and
spicy
earthy
yeast
note
give
way
to
lemon
and
clove
with
a
touch
of
candied
lemon
there
is
a
bit
of
an
herbal
back
end
taste
has
a
lot
happening
the
wheat
malt
is
up
front
its
earthy
and
musky
the
yeast
is
quite
spicy
mingling
with
the
candied
lemon
and
some
sweetness
through
the
finish
well
carbonated
spice
lingers
peppery
body
is
full
and
creamy
faint
dryness
and
a
bit
sweet
through
the
finish
o
one
of
my
favorite
new
glarus
beers
to
date
i
hope
they
bring
this
one
back
bottle
from
a
generous
friend
pours
a
hazy
orange
yellow
with
a
massive
creamy
and
fluffy
white
to
offwhite
head
the
head
just
wont
quit
beautiful
fruit
medley
of
banana
pear
bright
citrus
spicy
earthy
funky
yeast
bubble
gum
floral
notes
of
hibiscus
and
jasmine
and
even
what
smells
like
some
dank
hops
this
is
beautiful
really
incredible
nose
the
flavor
is
big
florals
and
zesty
hops
up
front
followed
by
sweet
pears
and
orange
citrus
then
finishing
with
a
funky
banana
yeasty
ness
there
is
significant
zest
to
this
in
front
of
what
seems
to
be
a
nice
hefe
and
the
combination
is
both
unique
and
deliciously
refreshing
i
am
surprised
at
how
bright
the
hops
still
are
as
i
waited
way
too
long
to
drink
this
medium
body
with
medium
high
carbonation
and
loads
of
complex
flavors
new
glarus
does
it
again
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
there
is
no
sign
of
the
9
abv
anywhere
this
one
could
get
dangerous
love
the
fruit
flavors
that
dominate
im
not
a
wheat
beer
fan
but
this
isnt
your
typical
weiss
the
finish
is
just
a
touch
too
bitter
couldnt
tell
its
as
high
as
it
is
in
abv
overall
this
is
very
interesting
maybe
most
like
a
belgian
tripel
i
liked
it
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
was
still
enjoyable
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
but
worth
a
one
time
shot
o
i
usually
dont
enjoy
hefes
that
much
but
im
very
glad
i
tried
this
one
its
a
wonderful
showcase
of
the
yeast
and
wheat
this
beer
would
be
perfect
at
a
grill
out
another
fine
beer
from
the
new
glarus
thumbprint
series
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
malt
complexity
up
front
and
a
little
less
booziness
overall
though
its
a
unique
beer
with
its
strong
fruit
flavor
substantial
belt
of
booziness
and
nice
spritzy
feel
i
think
this
would
appeal
to
fans
of
traditional
german
weizenbocks
and
eisbocks
who
are
in
the
mood
for
something
new
and
different
oan
underproduced
style
this
beer
was
solid

overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
ive
not
had
many
weizenbocks
but
this
one
doesnt
seem
quite
like
what
i
would
expect
from
the
style
as
i
hinted
in
my
review
this
one
reminded
me
a
lot
of
some
wheatwines
ive
had
which
is
a
good
thing
i
wish
this
beer
was
easier
to
get
because
it
was
absolutely
delicious
beer
is
mediumheavy
in
weight
with
carbonation

ethanol
felt
in
the
nostrils
aftertaste
is
moderately
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
coating
the
palate
and
lips
this
is
a
hazy
gold
beer
with
a
substantial
persistant
head
in
appearance
it
is
the
eptiome
of
hefeweizen
a
residue
of
yeast
encircles
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
a
faint
fruity
fermentation
aroma
overripe
banana
penetrates
the
head
and
carries
with
it
a
hint
of
citrusy
hops
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
and
desertlike
but
well
support
by
citrusy
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
that
prevents
the
beer
from
cloying
the
texture
of
the
beer
is
slick
and
lucious
with
some
alcohol
warming
but
it
also
carries
a
slight
carbonic
bite
that
helps
clean
the
mouth
out
and
ready
it
for
the
next
sip
what
i
love
about
this
beer
is
that
it
keeps
you
on
your
toes
by
presenting
contrasting
sensations
that
might
seem
to
clash
on
paper
but
work
well
together
in
your
mouth
it
is
a
cross
between
a
weizenbock
and
an
ipa
an
imperial
version
of
ngs
crackd
wheat
which
i
believe
i
scored
a
perfect
5
tonight
this
beer
doesnt
quite
merit
perfection
but
it
deserves
to
be
acknowledged
as
a
thing
of
beauty
served
from
bottle
at
the
brewery
pours
a

is

surface
the
taste
is
lemony
up

paired
with
pine
hops
followed
by
banana

grassy
and
earthy
notes
come
through
at
the
finish
and
provide
a
refreshing
bitterness
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
body
overall
this
is
a
unique
and
satisfying
brew
i
initially
had
no
idea
how
hoppy
this
beer
was
going
to
be
considering
its
style
but
i
must
say
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
o
a
weizen
on
steroids
big
alcohol
warming
banana
bread
flavored
slightly
sweet
wheat
beer
the
carbonation
got
away
from
me
on
this
one
but
overall
not
one
of
my
favorite
ngs
thumbprints
an
outstanding
beer
o
an
interesting
style
i
like
the
hops
in
conjunction
with
the
belgian
flavors
and
the
wheat
but
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
the
alcohol
flavorheat
combine
to
make
a
fairly
big
beer
i
could
use
a
bigger
body
to
help
carry
those
flavors
overall
a
very
good
and
interesting
twist
on
a
german
weizen
style
its
like
a
combination
of
a
hefeweizen
and
belgian
ipa
nicely
yeasty
and
juicy
mouthfeel
is
awesome
medium
body
and
huge
amounts
of
carbonation
leave
this
beer
feeling
very
fluffy
and
drinkable
refreshing
but
nt
to
light
high
b
o
definitely
a
great
beer
to
be
drinking
on
oktoberfest
weekend
new
glarus
continues
to
make
great
beers
that
are
surprisingly
drinkable
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
than
just
the
4
pack
of
this
great
weizen
prost
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
with
a
very
hazy
orange
color
i
smell
the
alcohol
and
some
spices
big
juicy
body
that
tastes
of
wheat
and
a
hint
of
citrusy
fruit
i
can
feel
but
not
taste
the
alcohol
it
is
nicely
wellhidden
hoppy
but
not
as
bitter
as
a
typical
ipa
pleasant
aftertaste
where
you
can
still
taste
the
fruity
wheat
this
is
a
very
delicious
brew
reminiscent
of
lagunitas
little
sumpin
sumpin
would
definitely
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
double
ipas
or
other
bigboozycitrusy
beers
light
to
mediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
delicious
think
hitachino
nest
white
ale
with
more
sweetness
and
more
alcohol
o
very
delicious
and
much
better
than
the
previous
unplugged
batch
dan
outdid
himself
with
this
one
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
this
o
this
beer
is
sunshine
in
liquid
form
bright
fresh
sweet
bubbly
on
the
tongue
fantastic
on
a
related
note
dan
should
really
try
brewing
a
batch
of
this
with
some
lacto
fermentation
o
love
ng
thumbprint
series
dan
is
the
man
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
damn
good
beer
o
a
frankenstein
of
a
weizen
but
very
delicious
i
bet
dan
had
fun
brewing
and
drinking
this
one
what
out
for
the
abv
as
you
do
not
notice
the
alcohol
wow
what
a
nice
complex
beer
you
just
can
not
go
wrong
with
this
beer
even
if
you
do
not
like
wheat
beers
i
can
see
you
liking
this
overall
its
an
intriguing
taste
something
that
i
may
try
again
later
on
in
the
release
cycle
but
not
something
that
im
going
to
stock
up
on
like
their
last
two
varieties
very
cool
brew
by
dan
carey
you
cant
pigeonhole
this
beer
into
any
one
single
style
i
feel
like
im
drinking
two
different
beers
in
one
its
very
interesting
and
worth
trying
for
any
serious
beer
geek
out
here
not
sure
id
stockpiile
bottles
of
it
as
i
cant
imagine
this
beer
to
age
very
well
one
its
a
hefeweizen
and
two
its
been
dry
hopped
so
drink
it
now
while
its
fresh
i
was
impressed
that
this
did
not
get
syrupy
or
cloying
given
the
high
abv
but
hefes
definitely
have
a
ceiling
in
my
book
i
have
to
confess
this
bottle
was
alleged
to
be
2
years
old
i
cant
confirm
that
but
the
expectation
on
my
end
here
is
that
a
fresh
one
of
these
would
be
wonderful
as
the
bottle
itself
suggests
but
an
older
one
just
doesnt
maintain
this
one
poured
a
really
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
an
average
white
bubbly
head
the
nose
is
vanilla
and
cinnamon
with
some
honey
sweetness
and
more
alcohol
than
i
am
used
to
in
wheat
beer
my
girlfriend
loved
the
flavor
thought
the
spice
and
sweet
combination
was
fantastic
i
liked
it
less
with
the
spice
being
a
little
overdone
and
the
wheat
malt
sort
of
having
a
deteriorated
flavor
to
it
not
as
fresh
and
clean
as
it
might
have
been
it
lost
its
ability
to
support
the
other
flavors
which
dont
seem
to
have
diminished
at
all
the
feel
came
across
a
little
thin
and
the
alcohol
was
piercing
new
glarus
does
some
wonderful
stuff
and
im
sure
a
bottle
right
off
the
line
of
this
would
rectify
that
viewpoint
but
this
beer
however
old
it
really
was
just
did
not
get
it
done
way
out
of
balance
weird
yeast
properties
and
just
sort
of
all
over
the
place
i
will
have
to
revisit
this
one
when
i
can
verify
its
source
and
birthday
golden

about
a

orangey

notes
malty

lots

in
this

though

has

mixed
with
plenty
of

medium

medium

lightly
dry
a
solid
hoppy
wheat

and
really
drinkable
despite
this
not
being
quite

i
expected
poured
with
the
yeast

with
an
offwhite

wheat

and
definite
weizen
yeast

taste
is
bitter
hoppy
yeasty
with
more
pineapple
and
tropical
fruit
notes
some
canned
pineapple
juice
character
comes
to
mind
quite
nice
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
on
draught
o
this
is
good
on
the
whole
but
it
needs
some
tweaks
as
far
as
the
yeast
is
concerned
an
excellent
beer
coming
from
someone
who
isnt
all
that
crazy
about
wheat
beers
very
citrusy
delicious
and
extremely
refreshing
o
this
was
a
pretty
complex
imperial
weizen
lots
of
spice
from
the
yeast
and
a
nice
sweetness
to
balance
i
really
like
this
one
hazy
golden
straw
color
thick
and
fluffy
white
head
long
lasting
scent
brings
a
big
whiff
of
lemon
grass
and
orange
rind
along
with
big
notes
of
banana
bread
some
bubblegum
black
pepper
and
yeast
taste
is
big
and
bold
nice
hop
notes
combine
with
amped
up
wheat
beer
flavors
touch
of
alcohol
medium
bodied
light
chunkiness
mostly
dry
and
slightly
warming
really
solid
beer
all
around
nice
touch
of
hops
on
nose
and
tongue
amazed
at
the
abvs
on
this
one
noticeable
but
still
well
hidden
o
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
really
turns
up
the
volume
intense
yet
still
enjoyable
though
i
do
wish
the
alcohol
was
either
toned
down
or
better
hidden
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
hefeweizen
on
steroids
not
my
cup
of
tea
o
damn
this
is
stupendous
and
incredibly
dangerously
drinkable
so
complex
and
lipsmacking
good
o
solid
body
makes
the
lemon
more
muted
but
still
keeps
a
good
balance
o
this
is
good
although
slightly
more
hoppy
then
i
would
really
ever
like
a
weizenbock
to
be
personally
the
smell
is
phenomenal
and
deep
down
under
the
mask
of
the
cascade
dry
hopping
there
really
is
a
delicious
weizenbock
to
be
found
while
i
may
not
understand
why
it
is
that
new
glarus
has
chosen
to
add
hops
to
so
many
of
their
unplugged
brews
lately
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
isnt
the
worst
one
definitely
wont
have
any
problem
polishing
this
4
pack
off
the
high
abv
is
also
a
real
added
bonus
overall
a
good
beer
beer
is
nice
medium
to
light
in
body
clean
finish
overall
a
nice
beer
nothing
too
exciting
or
surprising
but
it
is
a
solid
weizenbock
nice
fruit
flavors
on
the
midpalate
a
nice
finish
a
little
bitter
not
overly
so
id
have
it
again

two

way
down
the
nose
has
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
combined
with
some
banana
clove
and
a
touch
of
spice
the
flavor
is
fairly
boozy
with
some
spice
and
residual
sweetness
too
much
malt
sugar
remaining
here
imo
body
is
a
bit
thicker
than
id
like
with
some
extra
alcohol
i
prefer
ngs
lowerabv
german
wheat
offerings
the
beer
is
cloudy
and
straw
yellow
hued
with
an
inch
of
dense
white
head
the
aroma
offers
a
healthy
serving
of
banana
with
some
wheat
and
lemons
coming
in
behind
the
flavor
does
not
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
aroma
a
bit
soapy
and
alcohol
presence
which
was
absent
in
the
aroma
asserts
itself
in
the
flavor
profile
lemon
zest
and
window
cleaner
not
horrible
but
also
not
a
repeat
for
me
medium
bodied
with
an
odd
astringency
aventinus
is
still
the
go
to
weizenbock
for
me
d
another
solid
offering
in
the
unpluggedthumbprint
series
ng
has
a
knack
for
killing
german
styles
and
they
delivered
yet
again
a
decent
brew
that
i
would
like
to
have
again
but
itd
need
to
be
in
a
much
fresher
form
for
sure
pours
a

aroma
is
mostly
citrus
and
clove
tastes
of
banana
little
bit
of
hops
citrus
fruit
with
some
sort
of
funkiness
that
must
be
the
imperial
part
of
the
beer
sweet
throughout
with
a
little
resiny
aftertaste
smells
and
tastes
even
more
like
bubblegum
as
it
warms
crazy
very
good
very
complex
very
drinkable
o
this
stuff
is
unreal
and
if
ever
presented
the
opportunity
you
best
not
hesitate
a
dangerously
drinkable
ale
full
flavoured
and
scrumptious
o
this
was
pretty
good
overall
but
as
far
as
ng
beers
go
ill
stick
to

if
im
looking

something

very

overall
but
i
might
just
stick
with
the
d
m
in
the
future
cost
10
99
for
a
four
pack
add
a
few
extra
dollars
if
you
bought
it
at
the
gas
station
i
have
had
the
last
bottle
of
the
4
pack
in
the
fridge
for
a
while
poured
into
a
pint
glass
during
an
american
football
game
the
beer
was
a
golden
orange
color
a
mildly
bitter
aroma
tickled
the
nose
before
yielding
to
a
more
fruity
aroma
initial
taste
was
a
sweet
banana
and
cinnamon
flavor
that
melted
into
a
hot
and
warming
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
notes
of
citrus
are
also
hidden
among
the
flavors
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
in
terms
of
the
mouthfeel
which
is
somewhat
surprising
when
the
high
alcohol
content
is
considered
at
9
6
this
is
a
potent
beer
while
it
is
a
warming
beer
the
smoothness
suggests
that
it
could
also
serve
as
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
this
is
a
well
balanced
tasty
beer
pretty
good
but
i
prefer
most
of
ng
regular
wheat
beer
options
to
this
it
pales
in
comparison
to
dancing
man
and
laughing
fox
overall
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
less
alcohol
in
this
one
the
other
flavors
were
good
dont
know
that
i
would
go
back
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
sam
adams
boston
lager
pint
overall
i
didnt
think
this
was
too
bad
i
am
really
not
a
fan
of
wheats
or
hefes
but
this
one
went
down
a
bit
more
tasty
thanks
to
timmyj21
for
this
sample
overall
i
must
say
this
is
a
very
fine
beverage
and
extremely
enjoyable
i
for
one
cant
stand
banana
in
my
beer
and
this
has
so
much
else
going
on
that
i
almost
forget
its
there
absolutely
amazing
craftsmanship
to
bring
so
many
flavors
together
in
balance
overall
with
less
hoppiness
this
would
be
amazing
as
it
is
the
hops
mask
the
qualities
i
look
for
in
a
weizenbock
or
any
weizen
beer
o
not
bad
for
the
high
alcohol
present
in
this
weizen
but
overall
this
leaves
me
looking
for
a
little
more
smooth
and
balanced
beer
in
the
end
o
overall
damn
fine
beer
really
solid
weizenbock
a
bit
boozy
but
it
works
with
the
flavoring
bubblegum
booze
ah
nice
mix
do
this
beer
must
have
shared
a
similar
conceptual
origin
to
that
of
stones
14th
anniversary
emperial
ipa
such
as
lets
make
an
extreme
version
of
a
classic
style
this
imperial
hefeweizen
is
equal
to
the
success
of
the
aforementioned
stone
brew
showing
massively
amplified
versions
of
onpoint
traditional
qualities
if
any
weizen
enthusiast
ever
wished
to
be
able
to
smell
and
especially
taste
the
qualities
of
the
style
more
then
this
is
the
beer
for
them
it
is
held
back
only
by
its
heaviness
either
real
in
the
form
of
the
syrupy
texture
or
perceived
in
the
form
of
its
restrained
acidity
and
carbonation
cheers
overall
this
beer
is
really
the
best
of
both
worlds
for
fans
of
ipas
and
weizens
the
extra
hopping
really
adds
a
lot
to
this
weizen
style
and
i
would
love
to
see
this
as
a
regular
beer
in
the
new
glarus
lineup
well
done
new
glarus
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
imperial
weizenbock
from
new
glarus
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
major
apple
and
appleskins
lay
beneath
a
spicey
weizenbock
a
little
bit
of
pumpkin
seeds
and
basil
mixes
in
nice
complexity
and
bold
flavor
my
applause
to
new
glarus
and
to
klikger
rating
87
out
of
100
o
unlplugged
winner
overall
a
good
beer
but
like
i
said
the
flavors
fell
a
bit
flat
and
didnt
match
up
with
the
nice
aromas
o
a
fantastic
combo
of
hefe
and
hops
its
a
big
beer
in
flavour
and
alcohol
but
is
very
easy
drinking
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
love
wheat
beers
but
want
one
when
its
30
below
and
youre
tailgating
at
the
packers
game
this
one
will
keep
you
company
another
hit
out
of
this
cult
brewery
from
north
of
the
cheddar
curtain
weizen
yes
imperial
definitely
this
beer
demonstrates
how
to
put
the
imperial
in
a
style
o
a
nice
beer
that
is
dangerously
drinkable
considering
the
alcohol
level
m
good
creamy
but
not
heavier
but
heavier
than
a
hefe
i
could
dub
this
an
imperial
hefe
no
problem
in
that
regard
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
lower
carbonation
level
than
expected
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
everything
works
together
to
creat
a
complex
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
it
all
works
together
just
the
way
it
should
definitely
impressed
here
othis
one
shows
its
abv
to
a
fault
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sharp
and
the
spiciness
is
over
the
top
not
my
favorite
unplugged
beer
i
give
them
credit
for
trying
this
is
a
tricky
style
to
do
well
and
this
is
a
decent
effort
o
im
digging
this
beer
i
dont
know
if
id
go
after
it
again
but
its
solid
pours
a
beautiful
orange
gold
with
a
pillowy
white
2
finger
head
that
lingers
nicely
aromas
pouring
from
the
head
of
this
beer
spicy
phenolic
ginger
comes
off
strongly
to
me
with
a
hint
of
yeast
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
a
lot
of
flavors
here
berry
and
banana
ginger
spicy
and
phenolic
sweet
with
a
slight
bitterness
to
the
finish
has
a
nice
creamy
medium
body
a
little
sticky
on
the
tongue
finishes
a
bit
tart
and
dry
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
meant
to
be
sipped
otherwise
it
is
a
little
cloying
and
overpowering
i
really
liked
this
really
out
there
for
a
hefe
well
done
styledefying
flavorful
and
maybe
a
bit
excessive
in
the
abv
department
though
never
fuselsolventy
tastes
almost
like
a
cocktail
of
some
sort
albeit
one
with
a
base
of
traditional
hef
and
homemade
bitters
if
you
like
fin
du
monde
this
is
very
similar
but
better
nuzzling
up
to
perfection
what
an
uber
hop
weizen
a
la
american
style
absolutely
slammed
the
belgians
here
poured
with
a
huge
foamy
frothy
off
white
head
and
great
lace
aroma
is
banana
yeast
bubblegum
malt
hop
flavor
is
largely
like
nose
plus
yeast
bitterness
leaps
out
along
with
sweetness
of
the
malts
and
propelled
by
the
alcohol
body
is
outstanding
and
ditto
carbonation
couldnt
be
exceeded
finish
is
like
flavor
and
lingers
with
diminishing
presence
to
a
point
where
i
cant
find
the
point
only
that
i
want
another
point
the
occurance
of
excellence
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
big
head
and
excellent
retention
smell
is
banana
clove
spice
and
a
hint
of
earthy
citrus
hops
creamy
thick
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
finish
taste
is
banana
clove
and
cinnamon
giving
way
to
earthy
hop
bitterness
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
leaves
a
combination
of
both
on
the
tongue
very
interesting
and
well
executed
probably
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
ive
ever
had
have
had
many
before
reviewing
it
and
while
it
doesnt
taste
quite
as
good
as
when
i
first
had
it
this
is
an
excellent
balanced
beer
really
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
ive
always
been
of
the
opinion
that
heffes
are
too
delicate
of
a
style
to
flood
with
a
high
abv
something
about
the
overwhelming
alcohol
presence
just
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
on
this
one
although
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
still
a
hell
of
a
beer
just
not
the
hefeweizen
i
prefer
cheers
this
one
pours
a
nice
cloudy
tinged
gold
in
color
with
great
turbidity
the
aromas
are
moderately
sweet
full
of
banana
clove
and
it
has
a
nice
lemon
zest
aroma
that
is
really
interesting
the
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
and
ultimately
spicy
it
is
very
heavy
on
banana
clove
spices
lemon
and
oranges
i
dont
know
if
ive
had
a
hefe
quite
like
this
one
before
its
very
very
complex
the
lemon
and
orange
are
something
completely
new
to
me
in
regards
to
a
hefe
it
finishes
light
and
smooth
youd
have
no
idea
that
there
is
9
6
abv
it
is
so
so
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
deceiving
drinker
overall
this
is
a
very
very
nice
beer
and
a
very
interesting
hefe
this
one
is
a
legitimate
success
well
done
ng
o
all
things
considered
very
tasty
brew
a
bit
boozy
but
i
really
like
it
definitely
different
for
the
style
but
it
goes
down
quite
smooth
and
i
really
liked
the
complex
flavorsspice
great
job
o
great
effort
on
this
one
by
new
glarus
took
a
weizen
blended
its
sweetness
perfectly
with
dry
hopped
bitterness
the
cinnamon
was
the
perfect
ingredient
to
bring
something
completely
different
out
of
this
overall
i
like
the
attempt
of
a
hopped
up
hefeweizen
but
its
not
for
me
the
citrus
hops
and
bavarian
wheat
yeast
flavors
just
clash
to
me
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
id
take
a
dancing
man
over
this
anyday
all
in
all
a
must
try
for
anybody
who
is
looking
for
a
little
creativity
along
with
classic
weizen
flavors
overall
an
exceptional
brew
and
right
up
there
with
their
belgian
red
and
raspberry
tart
highly
recommend
this
goes
down
smooth
and
with
a
ton
of
flavor
not
avail
in
here
tx
dammit
but
got
one
from
ummagum
if
avail
near
me
this
would
be
in
heavy
heavy
rotation
hy
i
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
like
to
drink
again
o
i
didnt
go
into
this
with
the
highest
hopes
big
wheat
beers
are
usually
too
sweet
and
too
thick
for
my
tastes
however
this
is
a
really
solid
big
wheat
beer
that
walks
a
fine
line
between
american
innovation
making
shit
bigger
and
german
restraint
yet
another
welldone
beer
from
ng
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
and
yet
another
of
the
enigma
series
thats
well
worth
having
d
this
was
a
very
nice
weizenbock
not
sure
why
its
listed
as
a
hefe
on
ba
the
scent
and
taste
were
hoppy
but
still
enjoyable
and
fitting
for
the
style
similar
to
little
sumpin
extra
great
body
and
not
too
hot
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
mind
blowing
but
still
recommended
o
does
the
world
need
an
imperial
hefe
sure
why
not
sometimes
more
is
not
necessarily
better
the
lily
has
been
gilt
it
is
a
looker
though
soft
golden
orange
in
color
floral
notes
accompany
banana
in
your
mouth
the
banana
and
slight
cloves
come
alive
with
vanilla
and
a
evasive
but
creamy
body
a
slight
sweetness
balances
out
the
whisps
of
ethyl
presence
this
is
perhaps
the
most
balanced
complex
and
compelling
of
the
ng
portfolio
i
have
tried
overall
this
brew
throws
the
gauntlet
down
be
ready
to
take
this
beer
on
as
it
is
not
for
the
faint
of
palate
of
course
for
me
i
took
it
one
big
sip
at
a
time
not
wanting
to
finish
it
took
quick
trying
to
savor
but
wanting
another
sip
right
away
mouthfeel
this
beer
has
that
nice
lingering
effect
that
allows
the
flavor
to
stick
around
nicely
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
was
special
isnt
that
special
seriously
though
i
enjoyed
it
start
to
finish
and
recommend
it
for
those
who
want
to
expand
beyond
a
classic
hefeweizen
o
decent
i
understand
this
is
a
bit
of
an
experiment
as
it
is
a
completely
new
style
of
brew
but
one
of
dans
weaker
ones
unfortunately
hops
weissbier
is
a
hard
thing
to
get
right
dan
should
try
some
schneider
for
reference
o
a
very
ambitious
and
interesting
beer
by
mr
carey
yet
again
he
seems
set
on
making
only
one
style
of
beer
his
own
4
55
light
to
medium
body
with
a
sharp
fine
carbonation
that
pricks
your
tongue
as
you
drink
cheers
do
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
refreshing
and
easydrinking
beer
that
is
perfect
for
summer
almost
dangerous
given
how
much
alcohol
is
in
this
which
although
it
lets
off
some
heat
is
nowhere
near
the
level
it
is
sip
carefully
but
dont
be
afraid
to
indulge
awesome
beer
right
here
a
true
representation
of
the
style
on
an
imperial
level
i
will
have
to
find
some
more
of
this
one
what
an
accomplishment
despite
coming
from
wi
i
havent
had
any
of
the
unplugged
series
before
because
i
was
so
umimpressed
by
new
glarus
regular
offerings
this
beer
along
with
the
unplugged
iipa
have
really
changed
my
opinion
of
the
brewery
i
would
recommend
this
beer
both
to
weizen
lovers
and
to
fans
of
bigger
beers
who
might
find
some
likeness
in
it
to
a
belgian
ipa
albeit
with
a
more
german
ester
profile
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
pleasantly
carbonated
an
absolutely
fantastic
american
representation
of
a
classic
german
style
this
one
reminds
me
of
your
grandmas
upside
down
cake
but
right
out
of
the
oven
with
homemade
butterscotch
and
ice
cream
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
very
hazy
orangeyellow
with
nice
lacing
white
head
aroma
is
perfect
notes
of
clove
and
cinnamon
some
nice
banana
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
notes
from
the
dry
hopping
with
slight
notes
of
even
some
pine
and
grass
taste
is
a
bit
less
potent
but
has
notes
of
banana
tropical
fruit
yeast
and
some
slight
honey
pine
clove
and
some
sweet
fruit
finishes
with
a
touch
of
grainy
biscuit
very
nice
hefeweizen
balanced
not
too
sweet
i
much
prefer
the
dancing
man
wheat
over
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
amber
orange
color
with
a
large
fluffy
cream
colored
head
of
foam
on
it
scent
is
heavy
with
wheat
and
sweet
citrus
taste
is
really
full
of
flavor
for
a
hefeweizen
with
complex
wheats
mixed
nicely
with
coriander
and
a
slight
lemon
zest
quite
a
heavy
hitter
for
a
hefeweizen
but
rather
well
made
as
per
usual
with
new
glarus
beers
the
9
6
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
you
could
fool
me
if
you
told
me
that
was
the
percentage
on
it
its
smooth
and
crisp
and
really
thirst
quenching
i
know
banana
and
cloves
are
in
there
from
the
smell
so
try
it
youll
like
it
cheers
do
hefeweizen
isnt
my
most
widely
tried
style
by
a
longshot
but
id
put
this
right
at
the
top
of
any
ive
ever
had
another
winner
in
the
new
glarus
unpluggedthumbprint
portfolio
o
good
flavors
and
aromas
though
a
bit
too
big
to
drink
a
ton
of
nice
beer
o
this
beer
started
out
very
strong
with
the
exceptional
color
and
amazing
aroma
the
flavor
didnt
quite
live
up
to
it
for
me
felt
like
it
was
a
little
muted
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
complex
array
of
flavors
that
i
dont
feel
was
really
there
i
will
say
that
this
might
be
the
smoothest
10
beer
i
have
ever
drank
this
is
an
unusual
beer
and
a
good
one
also
a
point
of
interest
about
this
beer
is
that
it
doesnt
age
well
at
all
extended
aging
anyway
despite
its
high
abv
and
beeradvocates
not
a
style
to
age
unless
alcohol
exceeds
abv
range
which
id
say
it
does
my
disapproving
review
of
a
4yearold
bottle
was
removed
flagged
by
someone
obviously
upset
by
the
score
despite
the
caveat
the
aged
review
garnished
a
c
moral
of
the
story
dont
hang
on
to
this
one
for
a
while
o
im
always
excited
to
see
an
unplugged
offering
from
new
glarus
in
this
case
i
drank
the
first
three
in
the
pack
celebrating
out
on
the
lake
it
was
refreshing
then
and
refreshing
now
during
a
sitdown
review
i
find
that
it
drinks
very
young
the
combination
of
strong
boozy
waxy
lemon
flavor
dominates
this
beer
and
either
seems
unfinished
or
needs
time
to
mellow
not
really
sure
about
the
style
categorization
here
this
is
more
of
a
apwa
than
a
hefe
its
big
no
doubt
kind
of
wish
i
sat
on
it
as
it
feels
like
it
could
stand
to
mellow
out
one
bottle
is
fine
for
me
just
too
much
citrus
for
my
tastes
though
i
appreciate
the
effort
to
do
something
new
definitely
havent
had
a
wheat
beer
like
this
before
overall
thats
one
heck
of
a
beer
they
dont
come
much
bigger
and
bolder

frankenbrew
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
huge
rocky
white
head
aromas
of
spice
clove
and
bananas
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
clove
brown
spice
and
banana
this
is
quite
an
interesting
brew
from
new
glarus
im
not
sure
if
im
digging
it
or
not
as
an
experimental
brew
its
excellent
but
i
feel
that
the
high
gravity
hurts
the
beer
more
than
it
helps
dropping
the
abv
would
help
this
beer
imo
and
would
make
it
an
excellent
summer
drink
this
beer
makes
me
long
for
crackd
wheat
which
im
so
pissed
that
they
retired
this
year
it
was
my
favorite
beer
from
them
o
awesome
beer
really
enjoyed
it
drinkability
i
love
the
style
but
wish
the
alcohol
was
as
well
hidden
in
the
flavor
as
it
is
in
the
aroma
i
will
gladly
drink
it
though
albeit
slowly
and
responsibly
it
packs
a
huge
punch
many
of
the
micro
brewies
that
put
out
there
hefes
could
learn
alot
from
this
stuff
however
this
being
an
obvious
ramped
up
version
of
what
the
norm
would
be
all
hefes
need
to
be
like
this
then
it
would
be
a
style
i
can
actually
like
this
stuff

heavily
into

when
it
first
came
out

its
very

to
what
i
remember
and
yeast
flavors
and
frankly
with
a
slight
citrus
twang
on
the
finish
good

a

of

still
would
have
liked

i
will

to
them

easy
one
i
like
aroma
consists
of
booze
spices
in
the
middle
and
chewy
wheat
too
not
hidden
at
all
hoppy
in
a
belgian
way
which
reminds
me
of
urthel
hopit
herbal
quality
i
do
believe
this
is
nonetheless
a
phenomenal
beer
complex
tasty
balanced
and
high
in
abv
minus
on
drinkability
without
any
sign
of
it
plus
on
drinkability
seems
precisely
like
something
new
glarus
would
put
out
fruity
full
of
wheat
and
absolutely
tasty
turns
out
this
beer
is
hopped
with
cascades
dryhopped
even
which
explains
a
lot
of
the
stray
citrusy
hop
notes
i
was
getting
kudos
to
dan
carey
for
producing
another
beer
that
pushes
the
envelope
this
is
one
of
ngs
unplugged
triumphs
a
terrific
and
unusual
beer
the
spiciness
goes
beyond
what
one
normally
expects
of
a
weizen
cinnamon
flavor
clove
might
be
their
own
special
strain
of
bavarian
weiss
yeast
a
fine
beer
very
nice
the
best
of
these
unpluggeds
so
far
would
like
a
case
of
this
delicious
it
says
they
cut
dan
carey
loose
a
few
times
a
year
to
brew
these
unplugged
brews
i
say
they
should
make
it
a
monthly
thing
so
i
opened
this
up
and
even
the
foil
on
the
top
puffed
open
from
the
carbonation
as
i
poured
it
i
could
smell
the
citrusfurity
flavors
the
aroma
is
extremely
pleasant
and
i
think
i
smell
grapefruit
regardless
very
nice
it
poured
a
golden
orange
with
a
solid
head
that
lasted
through
the
entire
drink
the
lace
also
was
pretty
to
say
the
least
the
taste
is
bitter
and
sweet
so
as
my
recently
maturing
appreciation
for
hops
combined
with
my
love
for
a
hefeweizen
reached
this
beer
i
found
myself
saying
this
is
genius
the
mouth
feel
is
strong
and
pleasant
with
the
high
carbonation
and
overall
i
have
to
say
this
is
a
new
favorite
thanks
again
new
glarus
for
brewing
another
awesome
beer
drinkability
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
for
its
high
alcohol
content
not
that
im
complaining
of
course
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
nice
carbonation
that
moves
the
beer
fluidly
around
the
mouth
light
to
medium
bodied
definitely
drinkable
really
drinkable
flavorful
good
alcohol
balanced
refreshing
and
interesting
back
to
wisco

this
magnificent
brew
pours
up
a
thick
orange
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
nose
is
composed
of

orange
citrus
coriander
the
taste
is
smooth

it
tastes
the
same
as
the

full
bodied
low
carbo
best
hefe
ever
poured
into
my
westmalle
goblet
has
a
thick
foamy
white
head
and
a
rich
golden
body
has
aroma
of
yeast
wheat
banana
and
light
malt
flavour
is
wheat
and
banana
with
a
lttle
malt
and
spice
primarily
clove
very
tasty
and
reminds
me
of
the
good
bavarian
weizens
d
this
is
a
fascinating
beer
with
incredible
complexity
its
like
no
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
and
quite
a
mix
of
various
styles
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
beer
after
beer
of
this
but
i
dont
think
that
was
the
intention
anyway
it
is
a
treat
and
interesting
experience
d
complex
flavor
profile
with
lots
of
spicy
and
yeasty
notes
but
also
plenty
of
sweetness
and
a
pleasant
hop
character
to
boot
the
drink
is
crisp
and
juicy
with
perfect
cabonation
and
a
fluffy
silken
medium
body
that
aids
in
giving
ngs
unplugged
imperial
weizen
great
drinkability
from
reading
the
bottleblurb
about
the
hops
and
hopping
methods
employed
in
the
contruction
of
this
beer
im
sure
it
was
really
something
to
behold
fresh
but
even
at
a
year
old
the
superb
flavorful
beer
is
a
masterpiece

a

this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
huge
rocky
4
finger
head
that
leaves
really
sticky
lacing
down
the
sides
of

the
aroma
is
wheat
duh
up

with
bubblegum
banana
clove
and
what
reminds
me
of
possibly
smoked
wheat
malts
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
banana
and
clove
coming
through
but
also
contains
quite
a
helping
of
citrus
hops
also
the

comes
through
leaving
a
bit
to
much
burn
for
my
liking
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
hot
but
goes
down
creamy
leaving
a
smooth
sensation
on
the
mouth
this
is
my
first
new
glarus
beer
and
if
the
rest
live
up
to
this
one
ill
be
in
for
a
treat
when
i
crack
my
second
imperial
weizen
came
through
in
a
huge
way
simply
put
this
is
as
intense
and
as
good
as
a
hefeweizen
gets
another
outstanding
product
from
a
brewery
that
has
never
failed
to
impress
me
overall
quite
a
beer
thanks
shbobdb
for
the
excellence
d
style
wise
this
is
a
terrible
hefeweizen
but
i
could
care
less
because
it
is
a
delicious
and
complex
ale
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
an
example
of
an
imperial
version
that
doesnt
exactly
work
the
citrus
flavors
are
really
brought
out
here
but
it
hinders
the
appearance
of
that
nice
hefe
clovelike
spiciness
plus
the
sweetness
should
be
milder
interesting
attempt
but
overall
unnecessary
i
cant
fault
new
glarus
for
trying
but
i
would
much
prefer
a
black
wheat
dancing
man
or
copper
kettle
weiss
md
medium
bodied
and
very
chewy
good
levels
of
carbonation
and
any
alcohol
is
masked
rather
well
one
of
the
better
hefes
i
have
had
recently
purchased
at
the
ng
brewery
late
july
of
this
year
poured
a
semicloudy
peachy

in

the
imperial
weizen
actually
gets
better
and
better
as
you
drink
it
at
first
take
its
a
bit
abrupt
but
as
the
beer
is
slowly
sipped
it
becomes
far
more
complex
i
will
certainly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
a
fullbodied
complex

but
would
not
be
surprised
if
this
was
a
sleeper
definition
of
a
sleeper
beer
a
beer
that
will
knock
you
on
your
ass
because
the
brewer
cleverly
hides
the
alcohol
with
the
perfect
mix
of
brewing
ingredients
what
did
stick
out
the
most
with
the
taste
was
the
sweetness
of
this
brew
and
how
the
carbon
dioxide
affected
it
this
imperial
weiss
tickled
my
tongue
with
effervescence
and
left
it
coated
with
a
malty
sweetness
i
know
now
why
they
say
these
styles
of

are
preferred
with

just
not
my

but
it
is
okay
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
like
to
drink
again
on
a
nice
crisp
fall
day
for
a
dark
wheat
lager
from
germany
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
can
get
it
is
everything
it
says
it
is
and
more
for
me
i
cant
really
see
the
style
improving
much
and
like
all
the
plank
beers
its
quality
is
simply
astounding
and
well
ahead
of
its
peers
this
pours
a
charcoal
tinted
brown
color
with
some
yeast
sediment
and
a
rapidly
rising
milkshake
thick
khaki
tan
head
that
never
relents
the
nose
is
that
banana
clove
hefe
yeast
with
some
really
roasty
wheat
malt
that
stays
light
and
doesnt
go
bitter
as
well
as
a
clean
bready
lager
yeast
interesting
yeast
combination
here
very
german
but
also
quite
unique
the
flavor
starts
with
the
dark
grain
and
moves
into
a
slightly
boozy
malty
middle
a
little
sweeter
than
the
start
it
moves
through
banana
bread
bran
muffin
and
campfire
smoke
before
returning
to
a
relatively
clean
and
tidy
lager
finish
impressively
complex
not
overdone
just
clever
and
traditional
at
the
same
time
frothy
and
fluffy
feeling
aside
from
a
slight
alcohol
burn
this
beer
is
gentle
all
the
way
through
carbonation
is
just
active
enough
and
the
beer
opens
up
a
whole
lot
as
it
warms
too
the
thing
that
amazes
me
as
much
as
how
good
this
is
is
how
cheap
it
is
i
need
to
start

this

ester
flavors
and
very
smooth
to

for

a
very
enjoyable
offering
this
is
an
absolutely
delicious
weizenbock
hope
i
can
find
it
at
a
liquor
store
so
i
wont
have
to
pay
7
a
bottle
to
drink
it
you
get
the
sweetness
of
bubblegum
with
some
banana
but
also
lots
of
deep
roasted
malts
in
the
back
at
first
i
get
the
typical
weizen
flavor
the
superduper
sweetness
of
the
weizen
yeast
but
its
far
more
complex
than
that
i
get
black
or
chocolate
malts
some
coffee
hints
with
full
on
doppelbockness
of
the
malt
maybe
roasted
barley
its
highly
roasted
whatever
the
malt
if
you
let
the
beer
bypass
the
front
of
your
tongue
you
taste
the
roasted
barley
full
on
bitterness
is
there
not
pronounced
but
noticeable
in
the
very
back
of
the
tongue
i
find
its
a
shame
the
weizen
yeast
is
so
overpowering
for
it
almost
masks
these
wonderful
flavors
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
bubblegummy
wiezens
i
prefer
a
kristalweizen
with
more
lemony
notes
but
this
one
is
not
bad
at
all
the
marriage
of
subtle
sweet
malt
lots
of
portlike
dark
fruit
and
tart
wheat
really
make
this
beer
delicious
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
thoroughly
enjoyable
fairly
characterful
example
of
the
style
good
esters
keep
things
interesting
taste
is
in
line
with
the
smell
with
the
green
vegetable
taste
the
base
is
formed
by
a
very
malty
munich
malt
which
gives
the
beer
a
dark
taste
like
bready
and
caramel
but
without
any
of
the
roast
the
beer
is
not
bitter
and
has
a
firm
body
which
is
somewhat
sweet
but
not
overly
so
the
high
ratings
made
me
expect
more
this
tastes
like
an
offbatch
too
bad
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
aventinus
weizen
glass
tons
of
carbonation
a
huge
white
head
forms
atop
a
cola
brown
colored
body
that
head
stays
for
a
while
and
in
this
glass
it
looks
amazing
smell
was
of
fresh
dates
and
rum
taste
was
awesome
too
notes
of
molasses
caramel
banana
and
chocolate
covered
cherry
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
a
bit
fizzy
the
abv
was
well
hidden
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
thanks
to
drinking
drake
for
the
recommendation
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
an
ok
beer
and
an
average
example
of
the
style
it
had
all
those
great
weizenbock
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
this
style
in
the
aroma
but
when
it
came
to
the
taste
it
came
up
a
little
short
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
the
carbonation
was
to
fizzy
and
the
flavors
didnt
hold
my
attention
like
they
should
one
of
these
500ml
bottles
is
enough
for
me
what
i
like
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
nice
and
it
had
all
the
aromas
that
i
come
to
expect
from
this
style
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
taste
didnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
and
that
the
carbonation
was
way
to
high
and
fizzy
it
just
didnt
work
with
this
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
unless
i
really
wanted
a
weizenbock
and
couldnt
find
a
better
one
its
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
it
to
knock
your
socks
off
this
was
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
it
made
for
an
ok
first
impression
i
would
be
down
to
try
more
of
their
beer
but
i
cant
say
that
i
was
overall
impressed
with
this
beer
they
were
too
many
flaws
to
make
it
my
favorite
wallys
weizenbock
from
black
forest
is
still
my
favorite
of
the
style
its
such
a
damn
good
beer
and
it
blows
this
beer
out
of
the
water
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
spritzy
and
very
enjoyable
the
medium
body
is
great
for
administering
the
flavors
to
your
tastebuds
the
high
carbonation
cuts
through
the
body
with
ease
fizzing
away
whenever
it
comes
into
contact
with
your
tongue
the
swallow
is
rather
foamy
but
that
is
to
be
expected
for
the
style
overall
a
nice
german
offering
very
flavorful
and
definitely
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
one
drinkability
very
well
crafted
brew
it
lacks
the
deep
complexity
of
the
styles
heavy
hitters
but
it
is
still
a
good
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
a
wheat
beer
the
wheat
contributed
more
true
malt
flavor
and
body
than
wheaty
flavor
and
the
fruitiness
normally
associated
with
wheat
beers
are
solomn
and
make
only
background
contributions
to
the
beers
flavor
profile
a
quality
weizenbock
stronger
in
flavor
but
not
sharper
than
other
versions
of
the
style
would
check
out
again
definitely
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
raisins
figs
and
a
mixture
of
othe
dry
dark
fruits
in
the
taste
dark
fruits
of
raisin
and
fig
and
bit
sweet
and
quite
carbonated
a
small
carbonation
like
bite
but
mainly
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
sticky
sweet
dark
fruit
aftertaste
the
fruit
is
nice
and
different
but
it
is
a
bit
too
much
so
far
my
favorite
of
the
plank
beers
this
is
a
dark
brown
murky
and
rich
looking
beer
i
get
some
banana
and
spice
in
the
nose
reminds
meat
first
and
brieflyof
the
first
time
i
had
rochefort
10
that
rich
banana
and
clove
up
front
anywho
this
one
adds
some
bake
caramel
and
chocolate
rich
taste
nutmeg
is
more
apparent
here
and
the
banana
melds
into
dark
chocolate
sweet
roasted
malt
and
spicy
end
although
somewhat
light
like
the
other
planks
id
like
to
try
this
one
at
the
brewery
2nd
favorite
out
of
the
3
plank
biers
they
were
carrying
at
dz
pours
a
dark
russet
brown
body
with
a
foaming
tan
head
great
carbonation
levels
going
on
aroma
has
a
nice
dark
toasted
malt
tone
with
raisin
and
tart
apples
very
nice
spiciness
about
it
as
well
flavor
was
banana
bread
with
a
layered
charred
malt
character
adding
a
touch
of
smokiness
with
a
caramelized
malt
finish
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
fuller
bodied
alcohol
was
evident
but
not
overpowering
in
anyway
overall
drinkability
was
great
another
excellent
german
wheat
beer
served
properly
in
a
hefeweizen
glass
my
kind
of
weizenbock
this
competes
or
beats
ayingers
version
from
a
500
ml
stubby
german
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
clear
mahogany
with
violent
levels
of
carbonation
possibly
the
most
visibly
carbonated
beer
ive
ever
seen
and
a
huge
noisy
head
that
doesnt
retain
well
loads
of
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
turns
the
beer
muddy
and
quite
ugly
smells
doughy
and
yeasty
malty
fruity
and
vinous
with
perhaps
some
hops
fairly
similar
on
the
palate
with
a
light
sweetness
mild
bitterness
and
a
fairly
prevalent
note
of
acetone
or
ethyl
acetate
it
is
fairly
full
and
dry
and
despite
its
appearance
has
a
surprisingly
low
level
of
carbonation
not
an
unpleasant
beer
but
it
does
have
noticeable
faults
and
perhaps
some
age
on
it
i
imagine
it
would
be
better
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
the
taste
was
wonderfully
caramel
and
rich
with
kilned
malts
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
didnt
sit
me
on
my
ass
shouting
oh
my
god
so
i
gave
it
an
above
average
plank
is
solid
done
im
looking
forward
to
doing
comparisons
with
the
plank
heller
weizenbock
too
interesting
that
all
weizenbocks
are
lumped
together
on
ba
the
light
and
dark
variations
are
very
different
beer
is
good
this
ones
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
most
weizenbocks
are
we
dig
itbeer
in
the
raw
sort
of
a
steaming
hot
bowl
of
goulash
is
bold
enough
to
pair
with
this
beer
this
beer
was
fine
tasy
but
not
overly
drinkable
because
of
the
sourness
in
there
thick
mouthffel
its
filling
it
looks
good
and
dark
not
overally
complex
bang
the
style
but
the
only
beer
you
can
drink
in
a
night
lots
of
chocolate
malt
big
malt
aroma
bannanas
think
i
got
a
bottle
that
is
just
turning
bummer
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
fine
off
white
head
and
some
lace
color
is
mahoganey
aroma
is
malty
and
dominated
by
sour
flavor
is
like
aroma
and
again
dominated
by
the
sour
beer
tasted
like
it
was
almost
good
no
date
on
the
bottle
finish
is
like
flav
bummer
just
like
the
heller
weizenbock
this
is
excellent
a
great
traditional
and
old
world
example
of
the
style
highly
recommended
cheers
d
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
weizens
of
any
sort
but
this
beer
is
really
expanding
my
horizons
this
is
definitely
one
that
i
can
finish
quickly
and
drink
more
ill
have
to
pick
up
some
more
next
time
i
go
out
1227
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
warms
the
cheeks
and
tummy
while
keeping
its
composure
a
beer
meant
to
be
savored
lively
and
muscular
with
a
dark
fruity
center
500ml
bottle
into
a
duvel
snifter
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
decent
frothy
khaki
head
that
is
slow
to
diminish
and
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
decent
amount
of
dried
fruits
molasses
and
burnt
caramel
the
taste
is
a
blend
of
sweet
fruits
burnt
caramel
and
mild
spice
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
warming
alcohol
and
decent
carbonation
this
is
an
enjoyable
weizenbock
to
say
the
least
tastes
similar
mostly
bready
not
much
to
enjoy
medium
body
with
ok
carb
and
i
didnt
dislike
drinking
it
but
again
nothing
special
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
weizen
glass
this
brew
is
a
deep
reddishbrown
with
a
thick
white
head
that
settles
quickly
the
nose
is
sweet
with
ints
of
caramel
and
dried
fruits
hops
are
present
but
subtle
the
flavor
is
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
on
the
middle
of
the
palate
the
wheat
gives
the
beer
a
slight
tang
wich
is
very
refreshing
on
a
humid
day
like
this
one
the
finish
is
offdry
with
fruity
notes
for
a
weizenbock
the
plank
doesnt
have
as
much
body
as
i
would
have
expected
from
it
that
may
be
the
one
downside
to
this
beer
overall
its
pretty
good
and
quite
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
straight
up
solid
showcase
of
what
a
weizenbock
should
seek
to
be
like
perhaps
a
bit
more
complexity
to
its
chocolate
tones
and
a
chewier
body
may
have
lead
me
like
this
even
more
but
all
in
all
this
was
very
likeable
and
worth
the
4
d
well
this
was
a
disappointment
i
cant
think
of
another
beer
that
is
this
boring
especially
with
the
alcohol
content
this
has
d
this
is
a
really
good
brew
great
balance
between
wheat
and
malt
i
was
looking
for
vitus
but
the
store
did
not
have
that
the
clerk
recommended
this
beer
instead
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
i
do
not
get
a
lot
from
the
aroma
but
i
do
detect
some
cloves
and
banana
also
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
awesome
there
is
a
reason
i
like
the
darker
side
of
wheat
beers
fruity
esters
abound
in
the
flavor
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
finishes
clean
and
neutral
the
body
is
nothing
special
but
is
light
and
well
carbonated
i
have
not
had
vitus
yet
but
it
would
have
to
be
really
something
for
it
to
be
better
than
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
very
pretty
dirty
copper
with
a
tight
crisp
off
white
head
that
looks
ready
to
recede
to
some
patchy
sheeting
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
although
they
didnt
go
to
lengths
to
hide
the
alcohol
the
yeasty
esters
are
quite
pronounced
and
the
sweetness
combined
with
the
malt
promise
good
things
the
taste
is
quite
nice
with
the
banana
and
spice
predominant
and
the
malt
and
alcohol
warmth
at
the
back
the
body
of
this
beer
is
very
nice
with
the
wheat
malt
doing
its
thing
and
the
crisp
carbonation
make
it
an
easy
drinker
this
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
color
the
head
is
a
massive
three
inches
in
height
and
lasts
forever
leaving
thick
chunks
of
foam
all
over
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
cloves
banana
tangy
wheat
and
hints
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
full
of
tons
of
bananas
lots
of
cloves
and
a
trace
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
chewy
texture
and
vibrant
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
excellent
weizenbock
and
an
excellent
beer
in
general
i
will
surely
drink
this
beer
again
numerous
times
somewhat
hazed
reddened
amber
with
a
modest
head
spicy
cidery
aroma
sweet
bread
raisins
mild
holiday
spices
clove
and
chocolate
just
a
bit
of
dried
banana
more
spiced
flavors
than
a
typical
weizenbock
dark
fruit
apples
banana
and
bubblegum
tart
and
drying
with
high
carbonation
that
keeps
the
creaminess
down
pretty
good
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
raisins
sour
kraut
gumballs
caramel
toffee
and
paper
the
appearance
is
red
brown
with
a
nice
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
exceptional
i
would
recommend
this
this
is
rather
weak
for
a
weizenbock
perhaps
i
was
expecting
a
bit
too
much
not
bad
but
not
anything
overtly
special
if
its
on
sale
id
get
more
of
this
but
i
wouldnt
choose
it
over
a
few
others
d
ok
but
not
great
the
slight
vinegar
taste
makes
me
think
i
may
have
gotten
an
over
the
hill
bottle
maybe
worth
a
revisit
with
a
fresher
sample
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
drinkable
but
not
spectacularly
so
worth
a
shot
d
a
bit
to
bubbly
for
me
at
times
not
a
bad
thing
but
is
definitely
worth
the
try
a
solid
brew
and
that
makes
me
smile
great
flavors
and
a
great
vibe
all
around
other
notes
good
with
apalachicola
oysters
even
though
those
arent
my
preferred
variety
for
me
the
two
best
german
weizenbocks
out
there
are
schneider
aventinus
and
weihenstephaner
vitus
which
are
drastically
different
from
one
another
but
still
great
this
one
doesnt
come
close
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
finely
beaded
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
lovely
bready
and
banana
aromas
with
just
a
touch
of
clove
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
somewhat
similar
but
very
fizzy
which
distracts
slightly
from
the
flavors
but
it
is
also
quite
bready
and
with
more
pronounced
snappy
clove
and
somewhat
less
banana
up
front
although
it
manifests
in
the
finish
crisp
highly
carbonated
and
finishes
bready
and
slightly
sweet
with
zingy
spice
very
nice
example
ill
bet
this
is
not
quite
so
aggressively
carbonated
on
tap
nice
alcohol
is
reasonably
wellcovered
though
it
adds
just
the
right
amount
of
warmth
for
the
style
this
is
a
delicious
weizenbock
with
nice
balance
sweet
sour
then
bitterness
mixing
in
overall
i
found
it
quite
enjoyable
and
surprisingly
drinkable
given
the
strength
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
but
id
certainly
suggest
trying
it
mouthfeel
is
really
carbonated
and
gassy
it
is
almost
distracting
500ml
bottle
served
in
a
weizen
glass
tons
of
carbonation
massive
head
i
had
to
wait
for
it
to
settle
to
fill
the
glass
poured
a
dark
amber
pretty
restrained
aroma
of
clove
and
some
malt
i
got
a
slightly
metallic
note
that
wasnt
pleasant
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
malt
backbone
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
finish
i
was
pretty
disappointed
with
this
im
a
big
bock
fan
and
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
it
just
seemed
very
bland
poured
from
a
bottle
bought
for
2
99
in
northern
oh
a
steal
versus
45
in
mi
the
beer
is
dark
copper
burnt
orange
and
clear
with
a
massive
foam
comprised
of
large
celled
suds
the
nose
is
subdued
versus
competitive
weizenbocks
but
has
the
required
bananas
and
cloves
and
a
hint
of
lactose
the
taste
is
large
very
rich
with
bananas
and
cloves
and
a
little
bubblegum
very
sweet
tasting
the
thick
body
is
just
right
for
the
style
this
is
a
great
beer
even
if
its
aroma
is
modest
very
good
dunkle
opinion
well
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
the
helles
version
of
this
beer
without
the
yeast
but
i
almost
think
that
this
one
should
have
the
yeast
swirled
into
it
dont
expect
aventinus
with
this
beer
or
you
will
be
disappointed
this
beer
is
really
clean
with
the
weizen
yeast
character
stepping
in
just
enough
to
accentuate
the
beer
not
run
it
i
actually
like
this
trait
in
a
weizen
beer
as
the
really
estery
yeasts
turn
me
off
this
one
is
really
clean
and
drinkable
fairly
deep
chestnut
color
with
a
huge
head
on
top
very
very
highly
carbonated
fairly
mellow
bananaclovey
aroma
not
as
overbearing
as
some
solid
malty
flavor
with
a
nice
crispness
off
of
the
wheat
again
not
overly
done
with
the
weizen
notes
i
can
handle
one
this
mellow
slight
chocolate
and
smokey
notes
ok
bodyid
like
a
little
more
bock
character
body
wise
nice
dunkelweizen
pretty
non
offensive
for
those
of
you
like
me
that
are
not
huge
weizen
fans
d
nice
drinking
fullflavored
beer
but
not
over
powering
im
buying
it
again
and
pouring
it
fuller
to
decant
it
a
bit
and
see
if
that
helps
this
is
way
too
quaffable
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
if
i
was
to
complain
i
would
say
that
it
is
lacking
a
richness
and
a
malt
sweetness
that
one
expects
in
something
labeled
a
bock
on
the
other
hand
i
do
like
how
drinkable
this
is
and
how
nice
the
dry
yet
rich
malt
character
is
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
a
clouded
mahogany
brown
with
a
little
amberlike
tinge
to
ita
big
blooming
off
white
head
atop
aromas
are
of
green
apple
and
clove
mainlya
little
banana
shows
thru
as
wellflavors
are
a
good
mix
of
dark
fruit
and
a
slight
puckering
green
apple
with
some
underlying
chocolate
and
clove
medium
to
full
makes
the
flavors
seem
fuller
a
solid
weizenbock
here
it
has
rich
flavors
and
a
nice
feelplank
makes
some
good
beers
in
the
general
style
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
some
wheat
and
fruit
esters
it
has
minimal
bananaclove
character
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
crystal
and
wheat
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
dry
with
a
mild
yeastiness
its
not
a
powerful
beer
yet
it
weighs
in
at
7
5
abv
the
hefe
character
is
present
as
well
as
the
lager
dryness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
its
complex
and
flavorful
as
well
as
true
to
style
mouthfeeldrinkability
wickedly
aggressive
carbonation
that
explodes
like
dynamite
across
the
mouth
piranhalike
microbites
sizzle
the
tongue
while
the
beer
expands
in
a
gaseous
bellyfilling
fashion
with
barely
a
swish
this
puffs
the
cheeks
outwards
and
tests
my
pressure
capacities
strong
burps
ensue
punctuating
a
lessthanimpressive
weizenbock
experience
not
recommended
pours
up
a
dark
brown
with
dark
red
edges
a
nice
cream
colored
head
the
nose
is
chocolate
toffee
and
vanilla
ice
cream
that
is
interesting
tastes
of
slight
alcohol
spice
a
slight
metallic

taste
probably
due
to
this

maybe
being
not
the
freshest

red

carbo
i
had
a
better
bottle
of
this
in
austin
but
oh
well
so
off
balance
glad
i
have
a
second
bottle
will
revise
the
review
if
that
one
performs
significantly
better
i
can
tell
theres
a
great
beer
in
here
but
as
of
right
now
ive
had
many
better
weizenbocks
cest
la
vie
very
well
balanced
good
body
and
carbonation
very
well
made
excellent
i
could
go
for
this
often
d
the
sourness
kind
of
turned
me
off
but
it
was
a
good
weizenbock
and
worthy
of
a
try
not
bad
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
poor
due
to
the
overdone
carbonation
very
drinkable
the
carbonation
ruins
what
could
be
something
special
the
style
is
well
suited
for
the
transitioning
seasons
of
winter
to
spring
would
pair
well
with
pork
drinkability
theres
a
heaviness
to
this
brew
without
the
high
abv
that
would
limit
the
amount
one
might
drink
this
brew
but
this
is
definitely
quality
over
quantity
md
full
body
very
thick
feeling
but
not
sticky
or
astringent
light
carbonation
alcohol
masked
well
drinkability
is
decent
definitely
can
feel
the
fullness
of
this
one
very
good
beer
really
feels
like
you
could
live
off
of
this
if
needed
overall
a
solid
weizenbock
my
1st
of
the
plank
beers
and
delicious
d
a
very
good
recommend
and
very
good
drink
dgreat
beer
a
very
fun
complete
one
as
well
plank
bavarian
dunkler
weizenbock
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
in
fact
it
might
even
be
banging
on
greats
door
if
properly
carbonated
pours
a
nice
muddy
brown
color
with
a
pillowy
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
a
nice
cap
the
smell
is
of
wheat
malt
bananas
and
clove
the
taste
is
of
apples
banana
and
some
other
sweet
fruit
i
got
a
slight
wave
of
chocolate
malt
but
that
didnt
last
very
long
sweeter
and
less
dry
than
their
hefe
the
feel
is
moderate
with
fizzy
carbonation
finished
well
balanced
a
very
easy
to
drink
weizenbock
not
much
in
the
way
of
malty
taste
but
very
balanced
and
smooth
this
is
a
very
nice
dark
weizenbock
beer
i
first
had
this
at
the
german
beer
festival
in
boston
and
thought
i
would
never
find
it
again
but
it
is
available
at
elm
st
liquors
in
davis
square
another
feather
in
their
cap
for
what
to
me
is
the
best
beer
store
in
boston
area
the
beer
pours
cloudy
dark
not
much
head
and
what
there
is
is
a
bit
on
the
soapy
side
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
medium
bodied
and
the
smell
is
malt
yeast
and
cooked
prunes
the
taste
is
the
high
point
by
far
there
is
a
somewhat
dryish
for
a
weizenbock
malty
and
bready
taste
the
beer
is
amply
full
of
yeast
and
there
is
a
prunish
taste
in
the
mid
section
that
tails
off
in
the
finish
some
refer
to
this
as
banana
but
i
believe
its
more
a
full
yeast
flavor
that
is
pushing
things
in
the
bananaish
direction
this
is
a
very
nice
weizenbock
that
isnt
too
sweet
does
not
have
an
overly
syrupy
feel
and
one
in
which
the
7
5
abv
is
well
masked
worth
seeking
out
if
you
can
find
it
lchaim
d
easydrinking
dunkle
weizen
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
boldness
good
balance
wellmasked
alcohol
is
barely
detectable
this
beer
poured
a
brown
color
with
a
huge
rocky
head
that
quickly
began
to
subside
the
aroma
is
malty
with
the
yeast
noticeable
the
taste
is
malty
and
spicy

possibly
even
a
bit
floral
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
noticeable
overall
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
brew

not
offensive
but
missing
a
punch
drinkability
very
nice
example
of
the
style
but
not
as
good
as
the
aventinus
d
misleading
until
i
reread
the
label
bavarian
dunkler
weizenbock
not
nearly
as
smooth
as
it
smelled
and
tartness
made
it
less
drinkable
than
anticipated
not
the
best
representation
of
a
weizenbock
but
smell
was
weizenbocklike
while
the
taste
was
too
dunkler
like
overall
a
good
beer
just
doesnt
rank
with
aventinus
or
some
other
weizenbocks
ive
had
if
you
want
to
compare
it
to
straight
weizenbocks
overall
an
obviously
strong
beer
that
wasnt
too
overpowering
i
tried
this
beer
at
an
oktoberfest
celebration
and
found
myself
having
seconds
without
any
illeffects
beer
brought
to
beerclub
by
kkulacki
who
keeps
finding
these
planks
all
over
michigan
pours
crimsonmahogany
with
a
massive
white
head
looks
very
nice
smells
of
black
fruits
bananas
rum
malt
and
caramel
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
with
noticeable
alcohol
and
a
pruneybanana
blend
slightly
yeasty
banana
flavor
not
overwhelming
as
it
can
be
in
some
beers
of
the
style
very
nice
smooth
almost
velvety
a
very
nice
drinker
wish
we
had
it
locally
was
pleased
to
see
this
beer
on
the
shelves
after
reading
the
review
of
it
in
one
of
the
ba
magazines
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
rocky
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
of
sweet
berry
honey
and
alcohol
come
to
mind
for
the
aroma
taste
has
elements
of
cherry
plum
and
an
overall
wine
or
port
presence
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
quite
drinkable
great
example
for
this
style
tastes
even
better
if
you
let
it
warm
up
a
little
bit
under
the
cap
there
is
a
prolific
cascade
of
gunsmoke
a
pour
launches
foam
that
crests
and
recedes
relatively
quickly
leaving
a
sheet
of
coffee
ice
cream
colored
foam
banana
flambee
aromas
focus
neatly
on
top
of
cream
and
vanilla
a
murky
spine
of
burnt
oily
bitterness
swaddled
in
malty
viscosity
bright
husk
acids
splash
back
alcohol
spice
and
bitter
finishes
zum
wohl
its
a
crossover
to
be
sure
with
that
belgian
flair
and
its
a
damn
good
beer
but
trying
to
be
the
best
of
both
worlds
doesnt
seem
to
work
this
time
drank
real
easy
for
the
abv
this
is
a
nice
weizenbock
the
best
one
from
this
brewery
imo
id
pay
5
for
this
again
easily
wish
it
was
cheaper
though
i
like
this
better
than
adventius
i
think
so
say
my
ratings
need
to
do
a
side
by
side
comparison
d
the
taste
is
a
bit
below
the
level
of
aventinus
but
its
not
far
off
definitely
worth
a
try
this
is
a
very
nice
weizenbock
but
it
barely
falls
into
that
category
could
easily
be
confused
for
some
breweries
dunkelweizens
either
or
its
a
good
beer
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
heft
and
body
personally
i
paid
6
bucks
for
the
500ml
bottle
and
i
am
definitely
going
to
have
this
again
this
beer
was
given
to
me
by
a
friend
in
the
beer
industry
a
new
import
he
knew
nothing
of
the
brewery
just
that
they
made
good
beer
i
have
heard
this
many
times
and
thought
well
here
we
go
this
beer
comes
in
a
500ml
bottle
and
poures
a
dark
walnut
brown
witha
huge
beige
head
it
looks
great
in
my
appropriate
glassware
the
smell
is
great
the
taste
is
terrific
very
heavy
banana
carmel
malt
witha
slightly
dry
finish
mouthfeel
was
rather
viscous
and
veryheavy
the
drinkabilty
was
awesome
goes
down
so
smooth
and
warming
a
definite
winner
heller
weizenbock
is
not
my
favorite
weizenbock
however
it
is
solid
nonetheless
sure
worth
a
visit
for
those
that
like
the
style
an
odd
beer
lighter
in
color
and
flavor
than
a
bock
yet
with
more
bock
flavor
than
a
weizen
that
said
it
just
doesnt
have
much
flavor
not
particularly
good
yet
not
particularly
bad
either
worth
trying
once
but
probable
wont
revisit
it
too
expensive
for
a
mediocre
beer

with
a

that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
light
spotty
lacing
clings
on
the

with
a
good
amount

on

with

and
zero

medium

and
mediumfull

with
a
smooth
and
moderately
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
weizenbock
all
around
good
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
and
fruityearthy
yeast
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
the
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
enjoyable
and
refreshing
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
good
weizenbock
the
smell
doesnt
hold
a
lot
and
doesnt
profess
what
is
in
the
beer
but
when
you
get
into
it
it
does
really
well
i
would
put
this
alongside
ayinger
i
would
have
to
say
i
may
even
choose
this
over
ayinger
what
i
like
the
most
is
that
the
bockiness
is
subtle
it
is
noticeably
there
but
not
punching
the
wheats
lights
out
plus
my
bottle
reads
7
8
abv
and
it
is
just
not
there
smooth
and
hidden
below
the
layers
of
goodness
i
would
definitely
be
glad
to
have
this
beer
again
this
beer
has
a
light
gold
color
and
a
nice
solid
white
head
that
lingers
the
beer
smells
like
banana
a
little
spicy
note
maybe
clove
and
pungent
alcohol
the
taste
has
a
rich
malty
flavor
with
hints
of
spice
and
citrus
with
a
warm
flavorful
finish
an
interesting
german
selection
here
kind
of
a
merger
of
two
familiar
styles
takes
on
a
life
of
its
own
the
pour
is
cloudy
and
pineapple
juice
color
and
texture
with
a
good
solid
white
head
on
it
with
fine
retention
the
nose
is
that
classic
banana
yeast
a
touch
of
clove
spice
and
a
lot
of
booze
the
taste
starts
off
as
a
very
malty
hefe
the
yeast
is
the
only
thing
keeping
this
light
as
the
malt
gives
it
a
robust
flavor
and
a
rather
dense
body
some
light
citrus
fruit
in
the
taste
as
well
as
a
more
complex
spice
mixture
than
just
clove
it
reminds
me
of
sam
summer
with
that
grains
of
paradise
peppercorn
sort
of
complexion
very
different
with
that
banana
happening
id
call
it
a
tropical
profile
but
its
too
big
and
hefty
for
that
its
a
cold
weather
beer
for
me
the
body
is
full
as
it
can
be
in
a
beer
this
color
and
the
carbonation
is
pretty
active
overall
i
like
the
flavor
of
this
but
the
feel
and
the
alcohol
content
make
it
sort
of
a
contradiction
i
cant
get
past
in
some
ways
it
wasnt
to
be
easy
drinking
but
it
isnt
and
it
wants
to
be
a
slow
sipper
but
it
isnt
that
either
as
it
gets
a
little
gross
as
it
warms
a
neat
beer
but
not
one
ill
be
rushing
to
purchase
again
overall
interesting
version
of
a
weizenbock
unlike
any
other
wheat
beer
ive
had
as
mentioned
again
this
was
far
more
like
a
lager
in
flavor
than
a
weizenbock
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
nice
deep
amber
color
with
a
1
finger
off
white
head
smell
is
of
bread
apricot
cloves
and
honey
not
overpowreing
but
decent
taste
follows
the
nose
closely
with
some
added
banana
very
strong
fruit
front
which
was
a
bit
distracting
a
bit
heavy
on
the
apricotfruit
minimal
hops
bite
at
the
end
feel
was
good
with
adequate
carbonation
a
bit
dry
to
the
finish
overall
an
okay
beer
that
had
a
different
twist
with
the
apricot
taste
a
bit
too
strong
on
the
fruit
which
left
me
with
a
tart
over
the
top
taste
with
no
hop
balance
it
was
just
okay
imo
probably
wont
pick
up
another
overall
this
was
o
k
beers
body
is
medium
in
heft
with
a
midtohigh
amount
of
carbonation
the
beers
weight
is
substantial
enough
to
cover
this
the
result
being
a
lightly
tingly
but
mostly
pillowy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
finish
is
dry
and
a
little
sticky
with
sweetness
overall
dark
beers
arent
my
style
i
was
mistaken
when
i
bought
this
because
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
similar
to
a
wheat
or
bock
beer
but
i
wont
knock
it
because
i
know
its
good
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
o
weizenbocks
are
hit
or
miss
for
me
and
this
one
is
a
definite
miss
i
really
enjoy
braurei
michael
planks
dunkler
weizenbock
and
as
this
is
the
brewerys
most
awarded
beer
perhaps
i
simply
expected
too
much
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
hot
and
boozy
with
an
overly
simplistic
flavor
profile
i
probably
will
not
be
picking
this
one
up
again
the
rich
and
savory
melanoidin
notes
of
the
beer
definately
set
it
appart
from
other
beers
of
its
type
that
dont
take
as
much
care
but
the
oily
malt
character
offers
just
a
slight
flaw
in
taste
and
texture
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
definitely
a
recommend
i
picked
the
pint
up
four
4
bones
so
that
isnt
too
bad
i
guess
i
had
this
at
dz
back
on
cinco
de
mayo
along
with
2
other
awesome
plank
biers
this
was
actually
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
but
still
damn
good
pours
a
slightly
clouded
deep
golden
amber
hue
with
an
off
white
head
forming
thick
with
fine
even
spread
bands
of
lacing
aroma
has
tart
citric
notes
with
notes
of
spiced
applesauce
coming
through
with
some
mild
booziness
arising
the
more
i
smell
not
as
much
banana
or
clove
as
their
standard
weizen
this
one
just
really
flexes
some
fusel
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
malt
liquor
like
strength
flavor
has
layers
of
booze
apple
citrus
snd
sharp
wheat
a
semi
sweet
malt
character
minimal
herbal
hop
action
with
a
warming
level
of
booze
even
though
its
only
7
5
abv
mouthfeel
has
medium
bodied
even
carbonation
that
coats
the
palate
really
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
becomes
a
bit
more
than
i
want
overall
experience
was
unique
my
first
heller
weizenbock
interesting
hybrid
style
not
seen
often
in
the
states
overall
i
dont
think
id
revisit
this
beer
the
alcohol
was
much
to
strong
for
me
i
barely
finished
one
small
bottle
the
taste
was
much
more
like
wine
and
less
like
a
beer
in
my
opinion
while
i
was
hoping
for
a
hefe
and
received
this
one
i
gave
it
a
shot
not
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
i
just
could
not
get
into
this
beer
m
creamy
and
silky
mouthfeel
very
smooth
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
d
i
definitely
got
a
warm
fuzzy
feeling
drinking
this
beer
the
notes
of
prunes
and
apples
provide
the
right
enough
of
sweetness
very
enjoyable
review
from
notes
tasted
from
bottle
at
lush
west
town
pours
cloudy
orange
with
a
thin
lace
head
nose
is
banana
and
clove
with
caramel
malt
and
yeast
flavor
features
more
spices
than
the
nose
but
still
has
solid
banana
and
yeast
characteristics
the
body
is
light
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
long
yeasty
finish
not
as
wild
as
the
dunkler
weizenbock
but
if
there
was
ever
a
weizenbock
for
the
summer
this
would
be
it
salad
is
an
easy
pairing
were
thinking
fresh
arugula
grape
tomatoes
red
bell
peppers
and
gorgonzola
cheese
with
a
lemon
caesar
dressing
d
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
that
the
beer
is
rather
refreshing
to
drink
and
quite
thirst
quenching
straw
cookie
malt
sweetness
appley
yeast
with
some
phenolic
spiciness
as
it
warmed
flavor
was
sweet
and
wheaty
caramel
apple
with
a
grape
juice
aftertaste
after
a
few
sips
the
nose
became
similarly
cloying
there
was
a
light
astringency
or
apple
tartness
that
seemed
a
little
out
of
place
it
was
medium
bodied
with
fairly
low
carbonation
not
sure
how
old
it
was
but
it
was
the
first
time
i
saw
it
near
chicago
at
6
not
a
weizenbock
i
will
revisit
im
thinking
that
this
offering
would
be
great
with
pork
or
beef
anything
barbequed
would
be
a
plus
dark
golden
semi
cloudy
transparency
big
fizzy
white
head
very
fruity
malt
sents
with
subtle
hints
of
toasts
a
very
balanced
taste
and
quite
enjoyable
a
small
wisp
of
raspberries
seems
to
rise
off
the
tip
of
my
tongue
after
the
rest
is
gone
a
very
balanced
and
enjoyable
beer
cheers
d
smooth
and
drinkable
complex
but
not
distracting
in
aroma
and
flavor
at
almost
8
abv
taking
care
of
the
whole
bottle
by
yourself
almost
guarantees
a
buzz
not
bad
slightly
different
twist
on
the
hefe
weizens
from
the
major
brewers
more
emphasis
on
the
malt
rather
than
the
full
malty
yeast
character
ot
the
others
not
so
much
in
the
traditional
bavarian
flavaroma
characteristics
still
very
drinkable
poured
with
only
a
moderate
amount
of
head
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
color
is
amber
aroma
is
an
astringent
malt
flav
like
that
this
is
a
very
good
weizenbock
very
traditional
i
like
it
a
lot
and
something
that
i
would
recommend
d
quick
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
porch
beer
as
the
weather
warms
up
a
bit
too
gassy
for
more
than
a
pair
d
i
would
like
this
beer
better
if
the
flavors
were
more
inyourface
however
the
subtlety
probably
makes
it
easier
to
drink
im
gonna
finish
this
pretty
quickly
for
the
alcohol
level
the
taste
is
very
smooth
the
malt
flavor
cancels
the
high
alcohol
resulting
in
a
mild
but
not
sweet
malt
taste
the
large
bottle
goes
down
easy
with
this
drinkable
beer
very
refrshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
would
pair
well
with
any
white
meat
or
bbq
dish
a
golden
to
light
amber
color
body
with
a
small
fizzy
offwhite
head
some
lacing
left
medium
carbonation
aroma
of
bubblegumecloves
bananna
and
maybe
a
hint
of
cherry
and
alcohol
flavor
is
sweeter
than
expected
nice
clean
malt
flavor
cloves
leather
and
a
hint
of
lemongrass
light
bitterness
slightly
grassy
finish
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
medium
body
quite
sessionable
and
all
around
a
good
beer
enjoyable
dinteresting
take
a
blonde
weizenbock
it
works
for
me
not
a
tremendously
memorable
beer
but
worth
trying
the
biggest
issue
for
me
with
the
plank
beers
in
my
area
is
the
price
much
higher
than
the
other
german
beers
of
similar
quality
500ml
bottle
into
a
duvel
snifter
pours
a
murky
bubbly
orange
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
fruits
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
loads
of
sweet
fruit
with
a
hint
of
sourness
and
mild
spice
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
with
smooth
carbonation
this
is
certainly
an
enjoyable
weizenbock
d
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
when
i
opened
the
bottle
but
its
going
down
pretty
quick
i
shouldnt
have
any
troubles
although
the
carbonation
might
get
a
touch
bloaty
after
a
while
decent
weizenbock
thats
probably
not
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
better
options
out
there
was
ok
but
nothing
special
among
the
wheats
even
too
much
yeast
never
had
that
much
float
in
my
beer
more
then
a
finger
settled
in
bottom
taste
sweet
and
slick
at
first
with
spicy
yeast
flavors
that
pop
up
in
the
finish
a
german
style
that
leads
on
to
some
interesting
characteristics
pour
is
like
a
darker
hef
almost
amber
with
a
soapier
head
of
bigger
bubbles
as
the
beer
is
actually
quite
herbal
nose
of
bright
apples
and
a
mild
sour
and
wheaty
bread
palate
secondary
of
hef
fruit
and
bubblegum
and
a
nice
mild
sour
apple
and
clove
the
sour
seems
to
have
that
very
minimal
smoky
quality
to
it
gives
it
a
leathery
finish
that
is
too
dry
and
constricting
to
be
thirst
quenching
really
quite
a
bit
of
clove
that
goes
down
very
dry
some
alcohol
present
but
not
until
the
beer
got
warmer
a
very
solid
brew
and
drinkable
to
a
nice
fashion
of
soft
wheaty
treats
if
you
enjoy
a
good
wheat
beer
then
this
will
probably
satisfy
that
craving
this
beer
was
a
hazy
gold
color
with
tons
of
carbonation
and
a
huge
white
head
pleasant
aroma
of
banana
spice
and
wheat
i
enjoyed
the
taste
but
did
not
think
the
aroma
translated
all
the
way
into
the
taste
a
little
on
the
mild
side
mediumbodied
and
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
warm
late
spring
day
this
beer
pours
a
semi
cloudy
orangegolden
color
the
head
is
huge
too
huge
foam
filled
my
whole
weizen
glass
and
there
was
only
an
inch
of
beer
on
the
bottom
i
find
myself
sitting
here
looking
a
a
glass
full
of
foam
wishing
i
were
drinking
a
beer
the
aroma
is
of
vibrant
banana
clove
and
wheaty
tang
the
aroma
is
as
big
as
the
head
and
i
really
dig
that
the
taste
is
full
of
banana
with
the
clove
and
tangy
elements
rolling
around
the
edges
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
silky
texture
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
the
excessive
head
thing
is
annoying
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
makes
up
for
it
d
other
than
the
sweet
spicyness
very
drinkable
although
would
start
to
feel
it
after
2
d
very
easy
drink
could
session
this
beer
by
flavor
but
not
by
abv
the
aroma
is
wheat
like
with
bubble
gum
bananas
cloves
and
honey
the
appearance
is
orange
gold
with
a
large
head
that
fades
to
nothing
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
overall
this
is
good
but
not
great
it
is
still
worth
a
try
d
a
nice
take
on
the
style
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
this
bottle
seemed
much
fresher
than
the
last
plank
beer
i
tried
overall
incredibly
smooth
wheat
flavor
slightly
sweet
throughout
with
a
bit
of
sour
tang
like
a
cider
almost
with
maybe
some
spicing
hints
at
a
bubblegum
zest
in
there
too
everything
meshes
quite
nicely
crisp
and
carbonated
light
body
is
very
refreshing
not
too
cloying
while
still
being
flavorful
a
little
thin
through
but
that
doesnt
really
work
against
it
so
much
as
it
would
with
a
different
style
amazingly
smooth
and
drinkable
it
doesnt
quite
stand
up
to
vitus
or
aventinus
for
me
but
still
quite
worthwhile
nevertheless
i
do
dig
the
whole
sweet
and
sour
thing
though
d
just
a
very
nice
clean
beer
too
strong
to
session
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
could
have
had
another
this
has
the
taste
of
an
american
version
with
3
more
abv
to
taste
this
fresh
would
probably
be
a
joy
bottom
line
an
excellent
heller
weizenbock
im
glad
i
decided
to
try
it
pours
a
rich
lemon
yellow
with
a
head
that
will
not
quit
aroma
is
grassy
with
fruit
notes
very
inviting
taste
has
a
decnt
malt
presence
with
a
grassy
fruity
tartness
almost
winelike
in
dryness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
extremely
dry
as
mentioned
before
a
distinct
winelike
presence
very
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
hiding
the
7
5
abv
drinkability
a
pretty
easy
drinker
albeit
one
whose
flavor
ultimately
underwhelms
i
might
need
to
try
this
one
again
on
a
sweltering
summer
day
maybe
then
id
want
to
guzzle
it
down
quickly
while
its
still
icecold
and
that
could
change
my
impressions
overall
this
is
a
nice
nonthreatening
weizenbock
and
im
likely
to
buy
it
again
id
put
it
maybe
one
notch
below
weihenstephaner
vitus
which
is
similar
in
many
respects
pours
a
burnished
red
gold
color
with
a
very
healthy
head
that
fades
to
a
nice
cap
that
sticks
around
spicy
fruitcake
in
the
nose
with
clove
banana
pineapple
and
citron
dry
and
spicy
in
the
mouth
not
as
lush
as
most
weizenbocks
and
the
heller
version
is
far
less
rich
and
fruity
and
much
drier
and
spicier
than
the
darker
version
tasty
and
relatively
smooth
and
with
some
late
creamy
banana
once
you
get
beyond
the
initial
spice
blast
nice
if
the
carbonation
were
brought
down
a
bit
more
it
would
add
to
the
drinkability
imo
still
this
is
a
nice
weizenbock
with
an
interesting
sweet
and
sour
balance
with
a
touch
of
spiciness
d
good
drinkability
hides
the
7
5
very
well
a
clean
refreshing
beer
quite
drinkable
but
not
worth
the
extra
price
this
beer
is
nicely
drinkable
and
i
really
cant
find
anything
wrong
with
it
except
i
have
to
compare
it
to
aventinus
and
it
is
just
not
on
that
level
again
its
just
a
slight
step
away
from
a
standard
hefeweizen
whereas
i
expect
a
weizenbock
to
have
more
depth
and
intensity
good
but
frankly
it
makes
me
want
to
go
have
an
aventinus
opinion
i
am
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
bready
malt
flavor
with
plenty
of
mouthfeel
to
let
you
know
that
you
are
drinking
a
real
beer
i
have
only
made
it
through
half
the
beer
at
this
point
and
i
am
already
feeling
pretty
good
i
would
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
d
ok
didnt
find
it
stood
out
much
or
gave
me
much
incentive
to
buy
more
an
average
drinking
weizenbock
this
is
quite
nice
it
tastes
like
a
traditional
hefeweizen
with
the
volume
turned
up
just
a
touch
louder
for
just
about
every
aspect
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
its
not
4
50
a
bottle
good
try
if
you
like
this
falls
short
of
me
being
able
to
recommend
it
too
many
distractions
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
allowing
for
flavors
of
bananalike
fruitiness
that
gives
way
to
some
light
spiciness
a
great
teasting
beer
compared
to
others
in
this
style
it
is
what
they
should
be
judged
by
i
really
enjoy
the
flavors
a
really
nice
summery
beer
went
very
well
with
the
bbq
chicken
we
had
for
dinner
medium
bodied
great
carbonation
the
only
aspect
that
hinders
its
drinkability
is
its
heavy
lingering
finish
which
is
great
in
my
opinion
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
picked
this
up
down
in
greensboronc
over
the
weekend
and
iam
glad
i
did
poured
a
dull
cloudy
golden
with
a
thick
frothysticky
white
head
atop
a
mix
of
caramel
sweetness
and
clovelike
spice
in
the
nose
with
a
firm
bready
mat
base
thru
outa
mix
of
tropical
fruit
and
caramel
infused
alcohol
flavors
with
lighter
clove
and
smokelusch
full
mouthfeel
adds
to
the
drinking
experience
wow
a
nice
new
german
style
of
beer
i
have
never
had
a
pale
weizenbock
if
others
are
this
good
i
will
look
for
more
to
be
sure
5
the
very
simple
flavors
quiet
alcohol
would
make
this
beer
an
easy
choice
but
the
clove
becomes
more
of
an
annoyance
with
every
other
sip
its
a
lopsided
tradeoff
edit
recently
i
did
a
head
to
head
with
this
beer
and
vitus
from
weihenstephan
theres
a
definitive
herbal
note
and
lots
more
green
apple
but
i
dont
think
i
liked
it
as
much
as
vitus
the
herbal
notes
really
seem
to
be
a
large
factor
in
differentiating
plank
beers
from
other
wheat
beers
exceptional
germanstyle
beer
and
much
needed
after
so
many
belgians
the
night
before
in
atlanta
ale
party
good
constrained
bitterness
finishing
with
a
sweet
wheat
again
and
again
a
delight
for
lunch
surprising
7
5
good
head
and
grainy
creamy
mouthfeel
constrained
spices
secondary
bubblegum
bannana
and
clove
d
notes
a
nice
mash
up
of
the
hefe
and
bock
style
i
have
never
had
a
weizenbock
before
but
my
sense
is
it
can
be
done
better
not
to
say
this
one
is
poor
golden
with
a
mildly
disconcerting
neon
orange
hue
lots
of
bubble
traffic
up
and
down
the
head
is
billowing
and
requires
frequent
bitter
slurps
to
contain
once
its
rested
the
cottonlike
lacing
stays
firm
against
the
glass
subdued
aromas
of
candied
pecan
and
banana
linger
some
herbal
notes
as
well
very
fizzy
easy
to
drink
on
the
lighter
side
somewhere
in
hefeweizen
land
light
caramel
flavors
dominate
when
carbonation
hasnt
taken
hold
already
fresh
baked
bread
and
nothing
offensively
bold
in
terms
of
the
holy
trinity
of
yeast
banana
clove
13
of
the
glass
is
gone
in
minutes
for
7
5
that
makes
this
beer
insanely
drinkable
finishes
a
bit
salty
leaving
behind
a
oceanic
yet
grainy
aftertaste
which
is
a
little
strange
and
honestly
the
only
real
drawback
to
this
beer
like
one
friend
said
didnt
expect
much
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
like
my
other
friend
said
i
could
sure
drink
the
shit
out
of
it
drinkability
as
others
have
said
think
imperial
hefe
and
you
have
this
beer
quite
an
achievement
overall
i
thought
this
was
excellent
really
a
great
beer
and
something
that
i
think
everyone
should
try
it
may
seem
heavy
from
the
look
but
i
assure
you
this
goes
down
like
water
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
this
one
again
drinkability
very
pleasurable
and
easy
to
consume
definitely
worth
seeking
this
one
out
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
seems
to
defy
its
own
style
good
enjoyable
and
i
wish
i
had
purchased
some
more
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
weizenbock
poured
a
light
honey
color
with
a
lot
of
head
the
head
was
nice
and
white
which
diminished
to
18
of
inch
lasted
for
quite
a
bit
nice
lacing
lots
of
yeast
in
the
nose
with
a
slightly
sweet
yeasty
flavor
this
beer
tastes
more
like
a
hefeweizen
than
their
hefeweizen
does
7
5
alocohol
is
completely
masked
i
got
no
heat
from
this
beer
whatsoever
unfortunately
much
like
the
hefeweizen
i
thought
this
beer
lacked
a
depth
in
flavor
it
was
a
little
flat
especially
when
considering
price
d
damn
fine
a
bit
too
fizzy
for
my
taste
but
otherwise
a
fantastic
beer
drinkability
this
one
is
good
all
the
way
down
and
id
definitely
ask
for
seconds
i
am
not
too
keen
on
describing
the
details
of
beer
i
can
tell
you
that
it
is
not
too
hoppy
fairly
sweet
but
all
around
great
i
dont
usually
like
sweeter
beers
but
the
carbonation
and
other
tastes
of
this
beer
are
excellent
i
went
to
the
ba
german
beer
festival
in
boston
and
this
and
this
brewer
was
the
best
overall
in
my
opinion
great
beer
big
foamy
3
or
4
finger
head
that
settled
in
a
couple
minutes
golden
and
cloudy
very
yeasty
smelling
with
scents
of
clove
and
just
a
touch
of
banana
which
accurately
reflects
its
taste
banana
comes
out
more
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
finishes
smooth
with
lingering
spicy
yeast
taste
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
dvery
good
being
that
high
in
alcohol
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
not
to
mention
it
was
a
fun
complex
beer
the
beer
looked
outrageously
good
pale
golden
color
and
hazy
nicely
carbonated
thick
and
drysticky
poofs
of
foam
on
top
the
smell
was
bananaclove
and
a
hint
of
sour
milk
and
the
taste
was
seriously
rich
with
the
same
flavors
very
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
almost
a
new
standard
for
weizenbocks
very
nice
and
dangerous
competition
for
aventinus
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
very
creamy
smooth
carbonation
and
just
an
incredible
drinkability
this
one
goes
down
so
smoothy
if
this
was
available
anywhere
near
me
i
would
keep
some
on
hand
all
of
the
time
i
picked
mine
up
in
grand
rapids
mi
candied
bananas
aromas
rise
from
a
papery
yellow
pour
sporting
a
tall
whip
of
white
on
top
this
beer
tastes
like
banana
bread
walnut
hued
alcoholic
bitterness
characterises
the
finish
nutmeg
and
butter
tease
the
midpalate
assertive
cutting
lines
of
fizz
help
keep
the
experience
dry
it
is
a
bit
boozy
and
monolithic
to
drink
in
sequences
but
i
perceive
this
to
be
a
technically
flawless
and
ambitious
brewing
achievement
in
spite
of
all
the
bubbles
heller
weizenbock
is
one
of
the
best
beers
of
this
style
that
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
imbibe
im
not
the
least
bit
surprised
to
see
that
one
more
review
will
put
it
near
the
summit
of
the
top
weizenbocks
list
on
this
site
it
appears
as
though
the
brewers
of
aventinus
have
some
serious
competition
zum
wohl
man
oh
man
i
think
ive
found
the
holy
grail
of
bavarian
hefe
breweries
ive
yet
to
be
let
down
from
michael
plank
and
see
no
turning
back
in
my
quest
to
try
all
of
their
offerings
i
can
only
compare
the
majestic
visual
beauty
of
this
ale
to
many
world
classics
like
duvel
and
orval
it
seems
to
resonate
a
heavenly
frequency
as
it
sits
there
in
the
glass
awaiting
your
next
move
im
still
tasting
the
residual
yeast
powdered
sugar
and
lemony
rind
flavors
at
5
a
bottle
i
believe
this
will
be
my
splurge
beer
for
sure
an
instant
classic
says
i
hefeweizen
fans
take
notice
since
it
is
a
lighter
version
of
a
weizenbock
this
comes
across
as
being
a
something
like
a
superhefe
tasty
yeah
i
urge
all
of
you
to
seek
this
out
now
drinks
easy
for
the
abv
weizenbier
freaks
will
love
this
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
bodywheat
malt
profile
still
a
nice
one
never
saw
this
when
i
traveling
through
bayern
very
happy
to
find
it
in
such
nice
shape
so
far
from
home
tangy
wheat
malt
with
a
toasted
edge
up
front
big
ripe
fruit
cocktail
sweetness
quickly
takes
over
rummy
bananas
mix
with
yeast
and
gentle
clove
spice
fruity
sweetness
in
the
finish
with
moderate
noble
bitterness
and
yeast
fullbodied
thick
proteinrich
yet
gentle
creamy
feel
deliciously
drinkable
and
a
nice
mix
of
hefe
weizenbock
and
maibock
this
is
enjoyable
and
worth
picking
up
very
unimposing
and
flavorful
and
good
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
good
a
touch
on
the
lighter
side
but
still
good
body
with
lots
of
fast
moving
tiny
bubbles
that
race
down
the
throat
with
each
sip
and
get
to
be
a
bit
much
at
times
im
glad
i
found
this
tasty
brew
when
i
was
up
in
michigan
last
weekend
a
lighter
weizenbock
thats
tasty
and
has
a
bit
of
a
kick
at
7
5
worth
checking
out
i
hope
to
find
a
few
more
from
this
brewery
sometime
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
inclusion
is
well
integrated
at
first
and
gets
progressively
warming
as
the
experience
continues
there
is
lots
of
character
to
take
in
with
this
brew
and
while
it
is
quite
complex
it
is
very
enjoyable
and
easily
approachable
i
regret
forgetting
about
this
bottle
for
so
long
and
wonder
just
how
delicious
she
was
when
fresh
regardless
this
was
a
good
brew
and
i
would
buy
it
again
if
presented
with
the
opportunity
this
quite
sweet
beer
is
pretty
well
done
to
style
i
think
better
yet
it
has
layers
of
flavor
depth
and
complexity
that
are
very
well
balanced
this
is
a
smooth
rich
balanced
and
complex
brew
this
was
decent
for
a
weizenbock
but
ultimately
just
came
off
as
a
little
too
thick
and
chewy
at
times
im
glad
that
i
had
someone
to
split
the
bottle
with
this
has
a
medium
to
light
body
really
low
carbonation
with
gives
it
a
smooth
feel
overal
not
a
bad
beer
im
not
overly
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
seems
to
be
a
good
one
so
i
am
in
new
hampshire
for
the
great
bay
half
marathon
its
the
night
before
a
race
and
why
not
drink
some
ok
alot
of
the
local
beer
the
weizenbock
from
portsmouth
is
ok
not
a
bock
fan
this
beer
has
was
a
amber
in
color
with
thin
white
head
and
great
lace
the
smell
has
a
subtle
malt
and
bitter
nose
this
beer
was
grainy
and
malty
in
taste
the
smell
funnels
into
the
taste
of
this
beer
the
light
abv
leads
to
this
beer
being
a
being
a
potential
session
certainly
worth
a
taste
this
22oz
was
picked
up
by
my
mom
a
couple
days
ago
thanks
mom
it
comes
out
a
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
white
heading
the
nose
is
musty
at
first
but
is
followed
by
some
sugar
coated
brown
bread
and
a
small
amount
of
fruit
the
taste
blows
the
doors
open
here
i
get
rich
brown
bread
dark
berries
and
a
slight
taste
of
coconut
mouthfeel
is
fairly
heavy
on
this
one
with
the
alcohol
making
its
presence
known
this
one
doesnt
wow
me
that
much
as
far
as
the
style
goes
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
given
the
chance
weizenbock
is
an
amazing
style
that
does
not
get
the
recognition
that
it
deserves
try
this
one
and
remedy
that
taste
is
rather
sharp
at
first
and
astringent
but
then
a
creaminess
comes
over
with
a
slight
banana
and
clove
presence
riding
along
strength
seems
a
little
more
evident
than
it
should
be
at
the
abv
pours
deep
dark
bloodred
in
color
looks
more
like
a
doppelbock
not
a
ton
of
head
or
lacing
smells
typically
of
sort
of
roasted
dark
fruit
sweetness
a
bit
boozey
typically
again
more
like
a
doppelbock
flavour
is
absolutely
massive
it
is
bready
it
is
thick
it
is
boozey
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
that
it
doesnt
carry
its
alcohol
too
well
and
that
is
the
main
drawback
its
got
a
lot
of
plumy
flavours
not
much
in
the
way
of
citrus
here
mouthfeel
is
decent
appropriately
carbonated
this
is
like
a
weizenbock2
0
a
lot
stronger
than
youd
typically
find
also
not
as
easy
to
drink
but
still
very
good
drinkability
is
theres
a
whole
lot
of
meat
on
this
bone
out
of
the
tap
this
must
be
downright
creamy
from
the
bottle
it
holds
its
own
quite
nicely
heavy
at
times
spritely
at
others
there
are
a
lot
of
ephemeral
notes
with
this
one
still
its
another
velvety
project
from
tod
and
co
that
works
very
well
decent
but
it
is
certainly
no
aventinus
just
a
pleasure
to
consume
this
is
a
well
crafted
nicely
balanced
and
wonderfully
executed
ale
typical
of
portsmouth
quality
lots
going
on
here
the
maple
syrup
is
a
great
idea
and
is
very
subtle
i
might
not
have
known
it
was
even
there
had
i
not
read
about
it
on
portsmouths
website
none
of
the
various
flavors
or
spices
dominate
and
each
has
a
chance
to
express
itself
however
i
have
to
admit
the
apparent
bubblegum
note
really
threw
me
off
i
initially
did
not
like
this
beer
because
of
that
after
trying
it
again
i
still
notice
a
bubblegum
flavor
but
dont
seem
to
mind
it
incidentally
letting
this
beer
warm
a
little
really
helps
it
to
open
up
pours
a
deep
dark
mahogany
with
a
medium
sized
tan
head
the
head
is
alittle
small
and
leaves
almost
no
lacingbut
the
color
is
very
good
the
smell
is
strong
with
raisins
and
other
dark
fruitroasted
maltand
alcohol
the
taste
is
strong
with
dark
fruitroasted
maltalcoholcandy
sugarand
cloves
the
mf
is
medium
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
very
well
this
tastes
like
it
has
more
alcohol
in
it
than
it
does
a
very
good
beernot
my
favorite
stylebut
this
is
damn
good
drinkability
was
rather
good
while
i
would
have
liked
the
unique
complexities
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
more
pronounced
this
was
nevertheless
a
smooth
and
quaffable
brew
poured
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
that
left
a
thick
tan
head
the
smell
is
fruit
figs
plums
rich
dark
fruits
are
ever
present
the
taste
mirrors
the
nose
sweet
malty
floural
hop
presence
figs
candided
fruit
plums
follow
the
earthy
texture
the
finish
has
a
alcohal
presence
but
is
very
warming
and
nicely
balanced
with
an
acidic
feel
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
on
the
palate
whew
this
was
some
tough
sledding
had
this
in
a
tulip
glass
at
the
brewery
very
prettydark
brown
thick
head
very
sticky
it
had
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
and
was
fairly
malty
the
taste
was
sweet
but
not
overly
so
it
tasted
like
honey
or
maple
syrup
with
a
faint
banana
flavor
this
is
a
pretty
substantial
beer
i
had
two
and
had
had
my
fill
very
light
creamy
head
almost
like
that
youd
find
on
a
stout
with
a
pretty
good
stick
dark
brown
and
verging
on
claret
hue
with
a
great
amount
of
clarity
and
some
action
here
and
there
on
nose
roasted
malt
caramel
red
grapes
and
some
dusting
of
toffee
nice
candy
apple
sweetness
on
mouth
with
a
handinhand
wheat
tackling
dummy
and
some
very
pleasant
smoky
characteristics
very
sweet
very
nice
indeed
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
it
had
a
mild
aroma
of
roast
malt
along
with
some
scents
associated
with
a
weiss
beer
mild
cloves
and
banana
there
is
more
malt
in
this
beer
so
that
brings
dates
and
figs
into
the
mix
now
the
taste
wow
very
boozy
with
sweet
figs
and
dates
very
smooth
almost
creamy
mouth
feel
medium
drinakbility
due
to
the
alcohol

to
quote
lloyd
christmas
i
like
it
a
lot
i
have
enjoyed
face
plant
on
tap
and
from
bottles
during
my
last
two
montana
ski
trips
both
versions
pour
nicely
with
about
a
inch
of
foamy
head
that
does
not
hang
around
the
strength
of
this
beer
is
the
taste
wheat
dark
malt
and
what
i
can
only
describe
as
cadbury
fruit
and
nut
bar
i
enjoyed
this
on
a
chilly
new
years
eve
while
watching
he
torchlight
and
fireworks
overall
this
is
a
quite
tasty
doppelbock
not
super
wheaty
but
smooth
sweet
slightly
fruity
and
rather
easy
drinking
and
for
the
nice
price
this
is
a
good
winter
go
to
i
love
bayern
brews
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
state
of
montana
for
sure
i
love
the
dark
taste
of
the
faceplant
beer
i
always
look
forward
to
the
end
of
november
not
only
for
the
start
of
ski
season
but
also
the
release
of
this
magnificent
brew
cheers
overall
ive
been
drinking
bayern
beer
since
the
80s
and
have
never
been
disappointed
this
genuine
brewmeister
makes
the
best
lagers
in
this
region
hands
down
and
perhaps
in
the
entire
country
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
not
bad
by
any
means
balances
the
hops
and
sweet
malts
well
above
average
enjoyable
this
is
what
we
in
the
beergeek
world
would
call
a
malt
bomb
explosively
complex
the
decoction
mash
is
tooled
here
with
precision
to
create
this
amazing
brew
with
tons
of
malt
depth
another
beer
that
shows
that
german
wheats
brewed
by
american
brewers
dont
have
to
be
cloveandbanana
palate
killers
overall
if
you
are
really
into
bocks
in
general
this
beer
might
work
for
you
i
just
think
it
could
be
a
bit
cleaner
12
oz
single
from
lifesource
salem
1
79
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
quarter
inch
tan
head
daker
than
all
the
weizen
bocks
i
have
had
very
little
aroma
which
is
a
surprise
for
style
what
there
is
is
spicy
bubblegum
again
the
flavor
is
very
poor
for
a
doppel
weizen
its
nondescript
yeah
iots
pleasant
anough
but
not
what
i
expected
maltysugary
palte
is
fine
to
be
sure
soft
and
thick
very
very
dissapointed
appearance
is
a
dark
amber
brown
supporting
a
steady
healthy
head
leaving
spotty
lace
smell
is
faint
with
dark
malt
dark
fruits
and
yeast
taste
of
the
dark
malt
prunes
and
a
little
spiciness
from
the
yeast
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
body
with
a
good
spike
of
carbonation
for
an
american
weizen
its
not
bad
with
the
extra
kick
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
pours
a
very
dark
red
brown
two
finger
fine
light
tan
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
looks
nice
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
wheat
flavor
is
rich
sweet
malt
and
dark
fruit
only
slight
wheat
and
clove
weizen
elements
a
slight
ryelike
sourness
but
melds
with
the
sweet
malt
nicely
medium
bodied
with
slight
creaminess
finish
is
a
bit
dry
and
has
a
slight
hop
kick
with
lingering
malt
flavors
nice
flavor
integration
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
overall
this
is
very
similar
to
bayerns
other
beers
in
that
it
is
a
very
solid
highly
drinkable
representation
of
the
style
without
standing
out
in
any
particular
category
im
happy
to
drink
this
at
7
a
pitcher
3
85
maybe
stats
lie
though
i
will
give
a
2
margin
of
error
overall
drinkable
beer
but
not
worth
seeking
out
overall
4
a
tame
beer
for
its
dark
colour
high
alcohol
and
bock
name
the
weizen
traits
really
shine
through
in
the
light
malty
wheat
flavour
and
the
creamy
and
easydrinking
mouthfeel
the
power
of
the
double
malt
is
hinted
at
in
the
aroma
and
the
colour
the
higher
alcohol
content
is
effectively
masked
well
done
on
an
original
style
overall
i
love
this
beer
more
than
any
other
it
is
sweet
with
a
nice
slightly
roasted
chocolate
type
malt
complex
that
is
also
blended
with
the
flavors
of
a
dark
hef
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
it
is
definetly
different
as
you
get
bock
like
notes
along
with
some
traditional
weizen
notes
would
like
to
make
the
trek
to
sw
montana
an
try
this
on
tap
not
a
bad
substitute
if
the
better
bavarian
beers
are
not
available
thanks
sholle
for
the
opportunity
while
its
no
aventinus
this
a
solid
beer
and
as
best
i
can
tell
a
pretty
authentic
weizenbock
maybe
just
a
little
more
malt
to
balance
that
sweetness
but
this
beer
definitely
grows
on
me
the
more
i
drink
it
the
body
was
thin
for
the
style
a
bit
too
thin
imho
drinkability
was
ok
i
enjoyed
the
couple
i
had
and
would
have
more
but
its
not
the
first
example
of
the
style
id
seek
out
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
3
53
5333

it
has
a
very
light
moutfeel
very
easy
drinking
for
the
7

something
that
really
seems
to
warm
up
a
winter
night
drinkabilitya
tasty
beer
and
about
as
faithful
representation
of
a
german
style
as
an
american
brewery
makes
overall
nice
but
not
outstanding
overall
nice
ale
that
is
worth
trying
it
is
quite
unique
because
of
the
hefe
aftertaste
for
such
a
heavy
beer
d
at
7
5
this
is
very
drinkable
and
smooth
overall
pretty
good
especially
for
the
price
point
in
a
sixer
dark
brown
body
12
finger
white
head
quick
dissipation
and
minimal
lacing
big
malt
presence
in
the
nose
not
too
sweet
more
bready
but
some
subtle
hops
on
the
back
end
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
its
obvious
this
brewery
does
lagers
right
too
heavy
tasting
for
my
liking
have
to
admit
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
a
big
burly
bock
to
be
sure
overall
a
good
beer
although
i
would
recommend
dont
finish
a
six
pack
although
you
will
live
up
to
the
name
of
the
beer
o
this
tastes
a
good
bit
like
my
homebrew
weizenbock
this
one
obviously
having
more
developed
dynamic
character
really
all
this
needs
is
a
meaty
malt
punch
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
preferably
in
high
points
taproom
i
cant
really
add
anything
that
jason
alstrom
didnt
already
say
about
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
is
my
favorite
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
it
very
year
ive
had
it
in
bottles
and
on
tap
and
it
has
never
disappointed
i
do
agree
that
the
abv
is
hard
to
believe
it
is
a
dangerously
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
at
9
5
abv
another
great
us
craft
weizenbock
from
ramstein
very
dark
appearance
with
lots
of
deeproasted
malt
and
fruity
esters
the
finish
is
burnt
wood
and
earthy
hops
which
is
different
than
the
typical
bavarian
versions
personally
i
prefer
the
burnt
caramel
notes
to
the
fruitier
german
weizenbocks
i
really
wish
this
and
the
other
ramstein
brews
were
easier
to
find
in
pa
since
availability
is
important
to
a
beer
consumer
fortunately
i
came
across
this
one
at
capones
and
am
very
thankful
for
that
appearance
is
quite
dark
almost
a
stout
like
appearance
with
nothing
more
than
a
tiny
rim
of
head
nose
is
unique
and
very
malty
notes
of
grape
candy
wheat
and
a
hint
of
soy
sauce
and
cocoa
taste
has
fruity
components
up
front
with
emphasis
on
grapes
and
maple
syrup
this
is
followed
by
notes
of
carob
and
figs
with
a
touch
of
balsamic
vinegar
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thick
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
and
complex
weizenbock
however
the
flavors
just
dont
agree
with
me
this
is
a
very
unique
wheat
beer
theres
something
about
it
though
perhaps
the
intense
esters
and
phenols
combined
with
the
very
high
abv
and
superthick
mouthfeel
that
renders
it
a
bit
undrinkable
in
my
book
its
like
banana
bread
motor
oil
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
8oz
and
i
just
poured
myself
5l
its
no
aventinus
but
its
an
okay
beer
3
overall
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
a
older
bottle
like
last
years
but
its
notched
at
october
and
has
some
sediment
at
the
base
even
if
its
old
it
drinks
rather
well
overall
this
is
the
best
american
made
weizenbock
i
have
ever
had
surpassing
the
example
from
thomas
hooker
i
had
last
year
the
malt
base
is
definitely
darker
and
more
chocolateforward
than
the
traditional
german
example
which
allows
the
yeast
esters
to
not
strangle
the
flavor
profile
which
is
a
huge
plus
for
me
not
a
drop
of
detectable
alcohol
is
detectable
except
in
your
belly
with
that
slightly
warming
feeling
wish
they
still
bottled
this
because
it
is
by
far
high
points
best
beer
glad
i
was
finally
able
to
sample
this
highly
recommended
a
winter
winner
excellent
must
try
black
in
color
with
brownish
hues
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
poured
with
a
decent
beige
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
light
wispy
cap
rich
delicate
creamy
smooth
feel
wheat
malt
and
dark
fruit
aromas
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
delicate
wheat
malt
backbone
from
beginning
to
end
dark
chocolate
flavors
up
front
dark
fruit
flavors
thru
the
middle
and
light
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
finishes
with
a
bit
of
spice
combined
with
a
fruity
sweetness
overall
quite
complex
and
delicate
flavors
and
feel
o
i
love
weizenbocks
and
this
is
a
great
one
drinkability
and
overall
impression
for
drinkability
this
one
gets
top
marks
from
me
given
its
balance
and
complexity
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
world
class
weizenbock
and
shows
well
with
the
best
aventinus
id
love
to
be
able
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
this
beer
the
victory
moonglow
and
the
aventinus
what
a
tasting
that
would
be
this
is
a
brew
that
should
be
sipped
its
interesting
and
tasty
the
taste
and
feel
of
alcohol
is
slight
but
i
can
definitely
feel
the
effects
of
it
although
this
is
usually
out
of
the
style
i
usually
enjoy
this
is
a
nice
beer
o
very
smooth
and
easygoing
not
too
filling
either
due
to
low
carbonation
overall
i
highly
recommend
it
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
some
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
with
minimal
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
toffee
notes
and
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slightly
bitter
with
some
toffee
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
d
i
had
planned
at
one
point
to
brew
something
like
this
at
home
and
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
on
tap
in
my
opinion
this
is
simply
too
sweet
for
anything
but
an
occasional
sipper
i
cant
imagine
trying
to
get
through
a
whole
homebrew
batch
of
this
ramstein
winter
wheat
is
a
beer
that
is
hard
for
me
to
rate
because
i
have
had
so
few
examples
of
the
style
definitely
less
than
five
but
from
what
i
can
taste
and
see
this
beer
is
ostensibly
without
faults
the
beer
was
served
in
a
10
oz
tulip
from
local
44
it
was
nearly
opaque
dark
mahogany
brown
with
just
a
scummy
layer
of
ecru
foam
the
beer
smells
spicy
with
clove
and
cinnamon
fruity
like
candied
cherries
and
cooked
bananas
and
warm
like
cake
these
aromas
are
carried
over
in
the
taste
of
the
beer
it
is
rich
and
thick
but
syrupy
or
cloyingly
sweet
the
wheat
is
manifest
in
the
body
and
contributes
a
nice
bready
grain
flavor
the
body
is
luxurious
with
a
whisper
of
carbonation
that
is
perfect
for
the
beer
i
was
very
surprised
by
to
read
this
was
9
5
because
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
and
there
was
very
little
alcohol
heat
great
beer
several
months
past
the
best
before
date
so
i
assume
this
is
last
years
beer
with
the
high
abv
i
am
not
too
worried
about
the
quality
of
the
beer
popped
the
cap
and
there
was
a
lot
of
pressure
released
a
lot
of
foam
when
attempting
to
pour
into
the
glass
dark
brown
color
with
a
large
mocha
colored
head
that
quickly
builds
and
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
cap
you
can
actually
hear
the
carbonation
in
this
beer
not
much
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
interesting
aroma
of
mocha
wheat
malt
and
sour
cherrie
i
could
not
detect
the
alcohol
intense
flavor
of
chocolate
cloves
smoke
and
alcohol
very
warm
in
the
finish
there
is
something
slightly
sour
in
the
flavor
as
well
overall
is
quite
dry
a
large
body
for
a
wheat
beer
started
out
intensely
carbonated
but
it
settles
down
after
10
minutes
and
leaves
behind
a
good
texture
this
beer
hits
the
spot
on
a
cold
day
d
great
winter
warmer
when
you
are
looking
for
something
a
little
different
than
an
american
ale
packs
a
punch
but
is
balanced
and
smooth
with
quite
a
bit
of
interesting
depth
in
flavor
poured
a
deep
espresso
brown
into
a
tulip
glass
modest
effervescent
chocloate
beige
head
that
quickly
dissapated
nice
toasted
chocloate
funky
malty
sweet
aroma
tangy
sweet
malty
taste
while
i
dont
taste
the
9
5
alcohol
this
is
definitely
a
winter
warmer
thick
bold
and
flavorful
recommend
the
winter
wheat
with
a
nice
burger
or
steak
some
kind
of
red
meat
beef
very
nice
beer
hope
to
get
a
chance
to
try
the
rest
of
the
ramstein
line
nose
cloves
molasses
figs
and
other
dark
fruits
taste
tart
almost
lactic
like
qualities
initially
with
a
high
roast
like
quality
difficult
to
pick
up
a
significant
wheat
component
a
very
unique
take
on
the
style
esp
with
the
level
of
sourness
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
on
the
low
side
this
is
a
thick
chewy
brew
good
beer
overall
if
a
little
past
prime
t
it
disappoints
on
the
taste
end
it
is
very
dry
and
has
a
malty
taste
not
a
ton
of
flavor
which
is
surprising
when
compared
to
the
scent
into
a
tulip
it
poured
a
deep
dark
mahogany
which
revealed
some
more
chestnut
shades
when
held
up
to
light
one
finger
of
offwhitebeige
head
modest
carbonation
decent
head
retention
and
good
lacing
the
nose
was
a
hearty
blend
of
raisin
plum
fig
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
caramel
and
even
some
purple
grape
hints
the
taste
confirmed
the
nose
in
grandiose
fashion
big
dark
fruit
up
front
dissolving
to
maltycaramelchocolate
midpalate
and
then
finishing
on
a
semisweet
fruit
note
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
content
whatsoever
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
slick
with
little
carbonation
dangerously
drinkable
highly
recommend
aging
some
of
this
as
well
as
i
have
had
some
twoyear
old
bottles
that
revealed
stronger
hints
of
dark
fruit
a
truly
great
weizenbock
md
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
one
is
enough
for
me
thanks
mikeyv35
drinkability
good
stuff
presents
a
good
mix
of
flavors
with
a
wellrounded
smoothness
it
certainly
went
down
with
ease
for
purportedly
being
9
5
abv
i
would
pick
one
up
if
you
get
a
chance
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
cracking
this
one
open
served
in
a
tulip
poured
a
semitranslucent
brown
with
red
highlights
when
backlit
not
much
of
a
head
some
clusters
of
bubbles
but
thats
about
it
nose
reveals
banana
clove
a
malty
quality
and
molasses
or
brown
sugar
taste
is
fairly
sweet
for
the
style
a
hint
of
chocolate
a
little
earthy
a
little
herbal
overlaid
on
the
dominant
characteristics
present
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
with
a
mediumlight
body
really
tasty
with
a
great
deal
of
complexity
really
delicious
goes
down
a
little
too
easy
considering
the
wellhidden
abv
highly
recommended
based
on
othere
reviews
i
hope
i
have
a
bad
batch
here
since
i
do
enjoy
dunkle
weizens
but
shame
on
high
point
for
letting
this
get
through
overall
this
is
a
solid
weizenbock
i
definitely
recommend
letting
it
warm
up
a
bit
before
you
drink
it
the
flavor
profile
becomes
a
lot
more
expressive
d
this
was
an
interesting
take
on
a
weizenbock
i
am
more
of
a
fan
of
the
german
examples
who
isnt
but
that
was
certainly
passable
d
really
nice
beer
big
as
hell
and
tasty
to
match
all
things
considered
fairly
drinkable
after
major
disappointments
with
the
previous
beers
ive
had
from
high
point
brewing
company
this
beer
is
a
reason
to
have
faith
and
maybe
rereview
them
as
a
hefe
head
i
was
heartbroken
by
the
blond
wheat
and
the
classic
wheat
this
stuff
however
is
a
good
take
on
an
aventinus
for
a
lot
less
cash
well
done
hpbc
d
this
is
certainly
and
interesting
beer
that
has
been
on
my
wants
list
for
awhile
now
and
i
am
glad
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
finally
try
it
definitely
worth
a
try
and
i
will
have
it
againif
the
opportunity
arises
with
my
limited
experience
with
beer
this
was
like
a
dunkelweizen
but
with
a
delicious
sweetclove
taste
that
i
really
enjoyed
it
has
a
cola
appearance
and
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thinner
than
a
hefeweizen
but
seemed
similar
the
alcohol
is
incredibly
well
hidden
and
you
realize
this
only
when
youre
about
34
done
with
it
just
like
any
great
beer
it
does
loose
its
head
quickly
just
watch
out
for
infectedoldwhatever
batches
of
it
i
was
heart
broken
when
i
tried
it
in
the
bottle
some
guy
i
sorta
know
used
to
be
a
brewer
at
the
company
and
we
always
chatted
about
beer
he
gave
me
a
bottle
he
had
in
his
car
and
i
tried
it
was
oh
so
very
impressed
best
of
there
line
in
my
opinion
spicy
and
bitter
yet
refreshing
and
perplexing
left
me
wanting
more
so
i
got
some
more
and
more
all
in
all
sorta
yeasty
a
tad
spicy
like
almost
cinnamon
with
a
strong
bitter
but
not
alcohol
overwhelming
aftertaste
pours
up
super
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
brown
head
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
malts
dark
red
fruits
wheaty
wheat
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
subtle
sherry
raspberries
wheat
nice
malts
low
carbo
medium
bodied
a
pretty
tasty
burger
indubitably
drinkability
the
high
carbonation
the
slight
tartness
the
effervescence
mouthfeel
the
poor
head
retention
this
one
reeks
of
infection
however
reek
is
the
wrong
word
to
use
because
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
unintentionally
i
think
infected
beers
ive
ever
had
also
9
5
very
well
hidden
i
can
feel
it
in
my
belly
and
in
my
inability
to
type
well
at
the
moment
but
no
where
else
if
anythings
infuriating
about
this
brew
or
rather
my
attempt
at
drinking
this
particular
brew
its
that
i
can
tell
theres
a
really
awesome
authentic
traditional
weizenbock
behind
these
slightly
funky
notes
i
got
two
other
bottles
of
this
and
im
really
eager
to
see
if
either
of
those
have
these
same
problems
i
hope
they
dont
and
will
rereview
when
appropriate
drinkability
although
this
sure
could
use
more
carbonatin
the
flavor
profile
is
distinctive
and
enjoyable
low
browntan

on

down
and
doesnt
stick
dark
brown
body
opaque
nose
is

taste
is

sweet
banana
in
the
after
taste
some

carbonation
is
a
nice
balance
alcohol
heat
isnt
tasted
but
its
noticed
heat
wise
in
the
stomach
im
not
much
of
a
weizenhefe
fan
but
i
could
drink
one
of
these
on
occasion
but
not
back
to
back
or
over
and
over
a
good
example
of
the
style
none
the
less
props
to
my
buddy
adam
pebkac
for
this
one
drinks
fairly
easy
for
the
style
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
to
se
the
contrast
seems
slightly
off
style
but
agreeable
enough
md
medium
to
full
bodied
and
lots
of
carbonation
easy
drinking
with
a
well
masked
alcohol
profile
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
the
beer
stop
and
poured
into
a
dimpled
mug
appears
a
cloudy
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
dense
lingering
ecru
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
rich
and
malty
best
way
to
sum
this
beer
experience
a
sweet
chocolate
dipped
ripe
banana
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
and
spicy
yeast
plums
brown
sugar
and
booze
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
a
great
cool
weather
beer
dso
smooth
and
easy
going
this
brew
is
absolutely
delicious
an
excellent
winter
warmer
to
keep
close
at

32
oz

growler
from
new
beer
distributors
in
lower
east
side
manhattan
filled
by
the
brewer
who
happened
to
be
instore
sampling
his
stuff
i
preferred
this
beer
over
the
eisbock
for
which
this
is
the
base
excellent
weizenbock
so
many
different
flavors
glad
i
got
to
try
this
slow
to
drink
very
slow
so
lower
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
best
winter
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
9
5
is
extremely
well
hidden
cool
style
a
very
enjoyable
brew
really
complex
version
of
the
style
layers
of
flavor
here
drinkability
an
okay
beer
the
flavors
are
underdeveloped
flat
and
not
approachable
the
finish
is
dry
and
flat
not
worth
it
its
very
drinkable
and
plenty
tasty
this
is
not
aventinus
but
it
gets
close
worth
trying
for
those
within
distribution
range
despite
all
the
beers
strong
qualities
of
which
it
has
many
none
of
them
ever
become
overwhelming
i
havent
yet
had
anything
else
from
high
point
wheat
beer
co
but
im
willing
to
believe
they
really
know
what
theyre
doing
to
brew
a
beer
this
strong
and
mighty
and
not
compromise
on
any
character
and
still
have
it
come
out
eerily
sessionable
thats
the
sign
of
a
talented
brewer
its
also
a
sign
i
should
seek
out
more
his
brews
the
beer
is
way
darker
than
any
other
weizenbock
i
have
had
before
blackish
brown
with
a
dark
tan
foam
kind
of
stouty
looking
the
beer
smells
of
bananas
and
a
little
chocolate
the
taste
is
more
chocolate
than
youd
expect
but
with
all
the
banana
and
clove
it
should
have
and
no
lactose
i
like
it
a
lot
d
goes
down
easy
just
remember
its
9
5
abv
a
good
treat
but
i
wouldnt
grab
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
prost
pours
an
oily
black
with
a
gigantic
three
finger
light
brown
head
that
takes
quite
a
while
to
die
down
with
how
big
the
head
was
i
was
expecting
a
good
amount
lacing
but
there
wasnt
metallic
aromas
chocolate
and
banana
at
first
whiff
underneath
that
is
some
clove
helium
and
a
dash
of
pepper
taste
is
very
similar
hearty
wheat
bread
chocolate
malts
and
raisins
up
front
on
the
tongue
midway
the
clove
emerges
with
some
banana
and
brown
sugar
aftertaste
is
slightly
metallic
with
some
molasses
and
a
touch
of
smokiness
medium
body
but
a
touch
thin
with
a
fairly
high
carbonation
that
stings
the
mouth
one
thing
that
seems
to
stand
out
with
this
beer
is
the
9
5
abv
that
cant
be
found
a
very
solid
weizenbock
but
the
overall
feel
of
the
beer
seems
a
bit
off
d
very
too
drinkable
wish
i
had
more
d
i
drank
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
on
a
cold
snowy
night
very
enjoyable
the
body
does
need
work
though
d
this
is
the
most
interesting
wheat
beer
i
have
tried
i
was
shocked
a
little
bit
by
it
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
different
if
i
could
get
this
in
missouri
i
could
see
myself
purchasing
it
again
very
pleasant
quite
drinkable
best
if
you
take
it
slow
to
think
a
german
style
beer
like
this
is
coming
out
of
new
jersey
good
on
you
jersey
folks
drinkability
became
almost
tedious
without
any
carbonation
again
this
was
ontap
so
i
may
have
had
the
dregs
this
is
a
very
nice
wiesenbock
great
for
a
cold
weather
drink
has
similarities
to
a
dopplebock
in
its
richness
and
fruitiness
interesting
take
and
delicious
its
hard
to
believe
that
its
9
5
prost
beertracker
the
body
is
moderate
to
big
the
carbonation
was
too
big
even
if
you
dont
consider
style
i
distracted
some
of
the
maltiness
of
the
beer
overall
there
were
a
lot
of
distractions
in
this
beer
to
really
enjoy
i
wonder
if
it
is
better
fresh
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
poor
retention
is
not
a
good
sign
regardless
nice
but
nothing
special
the
pour
looks
a
bit
like
a
root
beer
though
decidedly
less
carbonated
in
the
nose
i
caught
some
clove
some
raisin
and
roasted
malt
the
flavors
were
nice
adding
a
fruitiness
like
chardonnay
masked
ny
a
malt
foreground
very
interesting
and
complex
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
there
was
anything
wrong
with
this
batch
because
it
was
part
of
a
case
split
and
no
one
else
seemed
to
share
my
sentiments
both
bottles
i
had
were
equally
lousy
i
think
i
just
plain
dont
care
for
it
too
bad
i
wont
be
back
for
more
light
roasted
malt
and
a
flash
of
noble
hop
bitterness
up
front
chocolate
malt
with
a
sweet
edge
leads
to
rich
banana
bread
sweetish
and
yeasty
and
delicious
dark
notes
of
tobacco
and
vanilla
mix
with
yeasty
cloves
small
amounts
of
noble
hop
bitterness
in
the
yeasty
finish
lingering
chocolate
fullbodied
proteinrich
feel
creamy
and
maybe
slightly
undercarbonated
all
in
all
a
great
weizenbock
an
intriguing
and
enjoyable
product
definitely
the
best
of
the
ramstein
bottled
items
ive
tried
hope
i
can
acquire
it
again
next
winter
ramstein
winter
wheat
from
high
point
wheat
beer
company
is
a
pleasant
taste
treat
it
pours
a
brown
color
from
the
bottle
there
is
a
nice
sized
tan
foamy
head
short
lasting
the
smell
is
a
mixture
of
grassy
notes
and
a
few
hints
of
citrus
coming
through
the
taste
brings
to
mind
thoughts
of
cloves
grass
and
fruit
put
together
this
is
a
very
nice
sensation
for
the
palate
there
is
no
indication
of
the
abv
in
either
the
smell
or
taste
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
a
highly
recommended
weizenbock
and
a
new
favorite
seek
out
and
enjoy
one
the
sound
that
seemed
to
have
betrayed
overcarbonation
turns
out
to
be
a
false
alarm
as
the
mouthfeel
is
never
fizzy
in
fact
it
borders
on
slightly
tired
still
what
a
fun
and
as
winter
brews
go
refreshing
beer
thanks
to
emerge077
for
the
sample
excellent
stuff
definitely
recommended
thanks
to
lupe
for
the
extra
dangerously
drinkable
this
was
to
be
my
second
in
a
drawnout
string
of
beers
tonight
but
this
is
probably
going
to
do
it
for
me
with
the
abv
the
problem
with
a
beer
this
tasty
is
that
it
will
be
gone
before
i
know
it
wow
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
9
50
on
this
one
hides
it
well
bottom
line
its
tasty
and
worth
trying
though
my
favorite
is
still
victory
moonglow
overall
not
my
favorite
in
terms
of
flavor
for
the
style
but
its
something
different
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
people
drinking
a
few
of
these
as
the
9
was
well
disguised
but
i
wont
be
drinking
anymore
of
them
d
overall
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
at
9
0
abv
with
a
great
spiciness
of
ripe
fruit
and
yeast
one
of
the
best
beers
out
of
nj
and
very
good
per
style
on
tap
at
bobbique
in
patchogue
this
beer
poured
a
near
black
color
with
a
nice
brown
head
great
aromas
of
spice
and
fruit
somewhat
similar
to
a
hefe
but
with
more
fruit
this
is
one
tasty
brew
with
a
mildy
fizzy
mouthfeel
big
flavors
of
dark
fruits
and
raisens
mixed
with
a
perfect
amount
of
spice
and
malt
make
it
very
drinkable
i
was
surprised
to
see
how
high
the
abv
was
but
it
made
sense
since
i
had
a
pretty
good
buzz
going
from
3
of
them
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
if
i
come
across
it
in
a
word
incredible
overall
this
is
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
ive
had
this
season
great
job
all
around
this
beer
is
one
step
below
pitch
black
held
to
light
it
shows
a
little
bit
of
ruby
nose
is
like
a
sweetened
molasses
it
almost
smells
like
a
syrup
flavor
is
rich
and
thick
with
extremely
strong
malty
characters
mild
molasses
in
a
deep
way
robust
full
and
lasting
never
even
hints
at
dropping
off
feel
is
very
thick
on
the
liquid
low
bubble
extremely
drinkable
well
made
and
oh
so
robust
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
go
for
it
had
one
last
night
and
it
was
great
the
one
i
had
today
was
more
sour
thinner
and
just
not
as
good
i
am
basing
the
review
on
the
first
bottle
hopefully
the
second
was
just
a
bad
bottle
and
the
rest
of
the
6pack
is
as
good
as
the
first
bottle
opened
with
absolutely
no
pop
of
carbonation
and
poured
with
absolutely
no
head
whatsoever
color
is
a
rich
dark
black
brown
smell
is
actually
a
very
strange
that
almost
made
me
gag
very
sour
grapes
and
raisins
taste
is
funky
with
a
lot
of
figs
and
tart
grape
vine
taste
mouthfeeling
is
just
watery
judging
by
other
reviews
i
am
hoping
that
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
overall
a
decent
cold
weather
session
beer
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
for
a
1
a
bottle
its
definitely
worth
it
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
weizenbock
d
not
bad
but
this
one
didnt
really
meet
my
expectations
more
body
less
fizziness
and
a
fatter
flavor
profile
would
make
this
a
hell
of
a
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
enough
not
too
filling
decent
kick
this
is
a
good
beer
to
choose
when
you
want
something
strong
but
you
want
something
thats
different
from
the
more
common
big
beer
styles

with
no

the
nose
has
big
pine
coffee
and
alcohol
along
with
smoke
mollasses

a
bit

lots

brown
sugar
chile
pepper
smoke
alcohol
and
a
bit
of
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
medium
bodied
with

carbonation
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
very
rinkable
beer
but
it
is
unique
and
great
on
a
cold
winter
night
quite
tasty
not
as
sweetbanana
flavored
as
some
still
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
quite
good
d
the
alcohol
is
strong
but
nowhere
bear
the
9

making
this
a
potent
ale
drink
with
caution
but
youll
enjoy
every
sip
ordered
the

poured
black
black
with
a
thin
head
looked
interesting
but
seemed
too
dark
i
really
could
not
pick
up
any
aroma
maybe
a
little
malt
to
me
the
flavor
was
way
off
it
tasted
like
well
water
from
back
home
it
was
thin
and
wet
in
the
mouth
the
best
thing
about
it
was
that
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
went
down
like
water
im
not
sure
why
this
is
rated
so
high
im
pretty
sure
the
pint
was
in
good
condition
oh
well
each
his
own
i
guess
poured
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
thin
quickly
dissipating
head
and
low
level
of
carbonation
slightly
viscous
pour
aromas
of
ripe
plums
dates
dark
chocolate
and
cream
very
intense
the
taste
is
intense
and
keeping
with
the
aroma
creamy
texture
with
hints
of
grains
and
fruit
juice
in
the
finish
pours
out
a
very
dark
brown
with
dark
red
around
the
edges
when
held
to
light
head
was
fairly
big
and
a
light
tan
color
retains
well
but
not
as
pillowy
as
one
might
expect
the
smell
is
one
that
ive
been
waiting
to
experience
almost
a
revelation
it
smells
like
a
wonderful
christmas
cookie
its
like
a
chocolate
dipped
banana
plum
mixed
with
caramel
and
molasses
cookies
taste
begins
with
some
plum
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
plenty
of
christmas
spices
as
well
then
ends
up
having
a
hint
of
burnt
caramel
and
just
a
touch
of
coffeelike
roastiness
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
with
just
a
little
bit
less
than
medium
body
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
in
this
one
im
going
to
see
if
i
cant
get
more
of
this
so
i
can
enjoy
plenty
of
it
during
the
next
holiday
season
although
im
sure
this
is
great
in
any
weather

jay
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
not
much
to
be
said
that
hasnt
already
been
said
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
decent
sized
tan
to
very
light
brown
head
smells
of
ripe
banana
spice
dark
fruit
maybe
alittle
bit
of
roasted
malt
and
has
a
lovely
bready
backbone
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
toasted
malts
and
an
added
hop
twinge
and
coriander
bite
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
drinkable
as
all
hell
with
the
9
5
only
becoming
apparent
after
my
second
bottle
and
letting
it
warm
up
quite
a
bit
a
true
gem
for
the
style
and
a
staple
in
jersey
beer
a
damn
fine
beer
that
defies
any
traditional
categories
pours
a
dark
and
milky
brown
to
black
in
color
cloudy
with
a
large
tan
head
that
slowly
winds
back
aroma
shows
clovey
spices
and
sweet
bananas
and
ripe
fruits
there
is
also
a
soft
malty
sweetness
that
is
somewhat
chocolatey
with
a
hint
of
roastedness
there
is
a
nice
malty
sweetness
that
mixes
with
a
somewhat
roasty
acidity
twanginess
soft
cloveyness
and
banana
sweetness
are
also
present
in
the
taste
alcohol
is
almost
not
apparent
hard
to
believe
the
abv
except
for
a
somewhat
spicy
mouthfeel
a
tingle
that
mixes
well
with
the
soft
and
smooth
body
there
is
a
very
light
dryness
in
the
finish
as
well
i
really
feel
as
though
i
could
session
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
that
well
balanced
and
the
crisp
tingle
on
the
tongue
keeps
it
refreshing
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
silky
with
a
real
wheat
heft
i
was
expecting
a
weizen
and
found
more
of
a
weizenbock
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
depth
of
an
aventinus
but
it
comes
close
especially
for
an
american
attempt
dark
chestnut
colour
with
a
light
brown
head
composed
of
fine
bubbles
this
settled
to
a
thin
wisp
and
solid
ring
the
aroma
started
off
with
lots
of
bready
banana
notes
but
continued
sniffing
revealed
a
bit
of
clove
some
roasted
malt
and
dried
fruit
these
characters
were
all
present
in
the
flavour
as
well
but
the
banana
was
a
little
less
pronounced
and
there
was
a
bit
of
cocoa
that
filled
things
out
carbonation
was
low
the
body
was
mediumfull
it
was
a
little
dry
with
a
creamy
texture
and
some
alcohol
warmth
highly
recommended
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
smooth
well
balanced
and
very
tasty
beer
very
good
definitely
one
of
the
highlights
of
the
tasting
d
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
fine
brew
although
the
abv
is
high
its
not
felt
right
away
although
the
warming
of
the
chest
has
me
rethinking
my
tune
incredibly
drinkable
for
the
abv
one
of
the
best
beers
brewed
in
nj
alchol
is
barely
noticeeable
despite
the
abv
level
so
it
creeps
up
on
you
too
easily
drinkable
a
very
good
winter
brew
this
one
is
worth
going
a
bit
out
of
the
way
for
mouthfeeldrinkability
soft
and
appropriate
for
what
it
is
the
slick
velvety
texture
is
exactly
right
for
this
stronger
wheat
beer
as
the
tasting
progresses
much
of
the
carbonation
subsides
and
it
becomes
less
interesting
a
delicious
rich
and
full
flavored
winter
offering
from
ramstein
that
creeps
up
on
you
yet
goes
down
so
easily
i
love
this
beer
and
always
anticipate
its
annual
release
here
in
north
jersey
weve
got
it
real
good
d
very
tasty
and
satisfying
an
excellent
example
of
weizenbock
one
id
recommend
and
will
seek
out
again
outstanding
drinkability
score
so
freaking
smooth
you
could
give
it
to
babies
my
only
complaint
here
is
the
total
absence
of
typical
german
wheat
beer
flavors
this
is
more
imperial
wheat
sweet
stout
to
my
taste
buds
but
it
is
quite
good
d
good
beer
really
grows
on
you
as
it
warms
up
unequivocally
recommended
for
beer
cellarers
one
of
those
what
if
experiments
that
definitely
panned
out
beer
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
color
with
a
minimal
head
the
smell
is
really
malty
with
a
pruney
note
as
well
taste
is
good
as
well
but
i
feel
like
it
lacks
a
substantial
body
there
is
a
good
amount
of
terrific
outer
tastes
but
as
far
as
a
cohesive
body
there
is
none
the
outer
notes
include
chicory
dark
malts
and
molasses
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
silky
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
with
flavors
of
ripe
plum
and
chocolate
prevailing
alcohol
is
present
in
the
finish
though
surprisingly
well
masked
doesnt
drink
like
a
9
5
superbly
crafted
and
supremely
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
to
have
in
your
fridge
at
all
times
though
alas
it
is
only
available
in
the
winter
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
perhaps
ill
seek
it
out
in
the
future

interesting
but
not
incredible
the
aftertaste
left
a
weird
yeasty
flavor
in
my
mouth
still
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
different
mix
of
flavors
and
aromas
that
may
take
another
beer
or
two
for
me
to
get
used
to
perfumey
alcohol
spices
malt
and
mild
fruit
notes
in
the
aroma
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
roasted
malt
spices
nutmeg
andor
clove
with
a
burnt
and
grainy
flavor
and
feel
the
alcohol
is
utterly
unoticeable
in
the
flavor
though
you
can
smell
it
departs
a
good
bit
from
most
weizenbocks
but
touches
some
of
the
bases
and
tastes
decent
enough
for
such
a
small
brewery
this
is
such
a
good
beer
always
in
demand
and
if
you
like
the
style
well
worth
getting
a
very
dark
weizenbock
letting
no
light
through
and
having
only
a
minimal
head
after
the
impressive
pour
smell
is
sweet
and
brown
sugary
with
banana
smooth
sweet
like
dessert
taste
is
roasted
and
fairly
strong
carmel
with
alcohol
well
hidden
only
providing
a
subtle
tingle
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
not
much
carbonation
with
a
little
sharp
carbonation
a
good
weizenbock
rich
and
delicious
but
falls
short
of
my
alltime
favorite
skyline
weizenbock
drinkability
nicely
drinkable
but
alcohol
creeps
in
a
bit
as
it
warms
drinking
a
few
of
these
slowly
can
be
an
easy
task
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
everyone
should
seek
out
its
kinda
dry
and
theres
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
im
left
very
satisfied
i
know
the
stickers
say
dopplebock
but
i
think
i
can
agree
with
the
weizenbock
classification
given
here
yeah
its
not
a
hard
leap
to
make
i
could
so
totally
have
another
one
of
these
but
id
need
to
space
them
out
oh
but
is
it
ever
good
medium
carbonation
and
a
smooth
medium
body
touch
of
soy
sauce
in
the
flavor
is
slightly
distracting
but
otherwise
nice
a
touch
of
chocolate
breadiness
some
dark
fruits
and
alcohol
soy
flavors
begin
to
dominate
the
others
as
it
warms
very
drinkable
but
nothing
so
compelling
that
id
want
another
musings
this
is
one
of
the
most
memorable
beers
you
will
ever
drink
as
you
finish
the
first
one
you
find
it
hard
to
believe
the
strength
an
amazing
beer
d
amazing
beer
drinkability
is
awesome
one
of
the
best
dunkelweizens
i
have
had
thanks
xcjetta
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
on
tap
and
will
try
to
find
some
more
of
their
offerings
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
semidry
finish
that
is
of
delicate
yeast
spice
fruit
and
chocolate
holy
sh
i
just
looked
at
the
alcohol
content
one
thing
i
have
got
to
say
for
this
beer
i
would
never
have
guessed
it
was
anywhere
near
9
alcohol
it
really
hides
it
quite
well
i
really
felt
warmed
up
drinking
this
which
isnt
the
case
with
most
winter
warmers
i
may
not
have
hit
this
style
on
the
head
since
its
relatively
new
to
me
but
id
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
looking
to
warm
up
on
a
cold
winters
day
or
expand
their
beerdrinking
horizions
one
couldnt
go
wrong
either
way
what
a
great
brew
ive
really
been
grooving
on
the
german
styles
recently
and
this
is
just
another
reason
to
celebrate
that
brewing
heritage
and
from
an
american
brewery
too
beer
is
limitless
in
its
possiblities
and
were
living
in
the
golden
age
huge
thanks
to
blitheringidiot
for
this
brew
really
got
me
back
in
the
game
a
wow
brew
that
i
didnt
see
coming
a
big
thank
to
cousin
stubob
for
sharing
the
one
with
me
very
nice
from
a
6
oz
sample
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
deep
deep
brown
color
with
ruby
hues
no
real
head
is
there
just
a
light
ring
very
dark
and
mysterious
look
about
it
nose
is
chocolate
covered
alcohol
soaked
banana
just
aqpuff
of
alcohol
is
in
there
solid
the
flavor
is
very
mellow
banana
and
cream
are
very
prevalent
with
a
more
subdued
background
of
fig
and
chocolate
no
hint
of
alcohol
very
tasty
the
feel
is
thick
with
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
very
satisfying
feel
overall
a
highly
drinkable
beer
id
like
a
touch
more
of
an
edge
on
the
dark
malt
i
would
drink
this
again

a
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
one
finger
of
head
that
dies

quickly
there
is
no
lacing
the
smell
is
full
of
wheat
malt
yeast
and
spices
it
has
lots
of
cloves
and
a
nice
roasty
character
the
taste
is
fantastic
as
well
it
has
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
and
bready
flavors
up
front
there
is
just
a
little
bit
of
the
classic
banana
and
clove
in
there
as
well
very
deep
and
complex
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
strong
yet
smooth
the
drinkability
is
awesome
for
such
a
strong
beer
truely
unique
my
hats
off
to
kev
he
is
king
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
dark
malts
and
lots
of
fruitiness
slight
coffee
aromas
as
well
the
flavor
is
very
nice
lots
of
chocolate
and
some
fruits
and
a
little
coffee
very
smooth
and
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
thanks
to
eyedrinkale
for
the
opportunity
and
whatever
bif
that
was
that
we
were
in
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
with
a
mega
malt
presence
that
fills
the
mouth
mellow
carbonation
works
well
here
one
of
the
few
weizenbocks
ive
had
this
is
quite
tasty
and
i
wouldnt
mind
a
few
in
a
sitting
this
is
how
i
like
my
wheat
beers
thanks
to
dmeadows
for
the
opportunity
to
sample
this
one
poured
a
deep
brown
reddish
color
with
moderate
tannish
creamy
head
smellmwas
of
dark
fruits
plums
raisins
mixed
with
malt
taste
was
strongly
alcololic
and
very
overpowering
to
the
senses
finish
was
malty
but
not
a
taste
i
liked
after
all
the
high
prasie
for
this
beer
i
was
very
dissapointed
maybe
ill
try
another
years
batch
another
thanks
to
pegasus
for
sharing
the
bottle
drinkabilitynotes
very
pleasing
although
the
tart
note
beneath
the
surface
in
the
taste
seemed
slightly
oppressive
as
the
tasting
progressed
i
am
made
to
wonder
if
this
sample
had
suffered
in
transport
or
storage
still
its
one
i
would
like
to
try
again
a
word
to
the
wise
the
alcoholic
content
of
this
beer
is
very
well
disguised
it
seemed
only
a
little
stronger
than
a
typical
beer
pours
a
dark
chocolate
brown
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
chocolate
molasses
and
caramel
a
little
bit
of
coffee
and
fruitiness
to
go
along
with
some
clove
spiciness
too
roasted
malts
are
the
first
thing
i
taste
also
some
currants
caramel
brown
sugar
cloves
and
just
enough
hops
for
a
nice
balance
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
i
found
myself
drinking
this
one
pretty
quickly
while
not
prone
to
the
most
poignant
of
superlatives
this
one
indeed
left
me
inspired
poured
into
an
imperial

translucent

bubbles

aroma
is
dark
malty
sweetness
coupled
with
heavy
vinous
fruits
and
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
tinge
taste
is
all
the
nose
indicated
and
more
so
creaminess
just
makes
the
mouthfeel
a
dream
and
drinkability
benefits
from
both
complexity
which
induces
revisiting
for
me
and
just
the
ease
with
which
it
goes
down
a
very
good
wheat
beer
in
my
opinion
smooth
and
dark
wine
attractiveness
chocolate
bourbon
and
alcohol
in
aroma
upfront
carbonation
very
nice
and
drinkable

low

have
been

malty
and
slightly
sour
some
hint
of
cloves
and
overripe
figs
virtually
no
hint
of
alcohol
malt
malt
everywhere
with
a
slightly
nutty

you
pulled

needle
out
of
barry

and
injected
it
into
a
fruity
dunkelweiss
and
then
mixed
it

a
good
barleywine
youd
have
this
bad
boy
this
beer
whispers
sweet
love
in
your
ear
before
it
punches
you
in
the
back
of
the
head
yeow
i
believe
this
bottle
is
a
little
over
a
year
old
and
thanks
goes
to
slander
for
this
pours
out
black
with
a
small
tan
bubbly
head
that
dies
quickly
but
leaves
some
sheets
of
lace
stuck
to
the
glass
aroma
is
strong
with
sweet
ripe
dark
fruits
prunes
and
figs
there
is
a
nice
roastiness
there
as
well
as
a
syrupy
molasses
scent
something
barleywinesque
is
going
on
in
the
nose
as
well
flavor
is
a
bit
tamer
sweet
fruits
over
a
slight
wheat
flavor
some
roastiness
is
in
the
background
and
it
has
a
lingering
fruitiness
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
with
a
sticky
sweetness
that
coats
the
mouth
very
drinkable
stuff
here
this
went
down
easy
and
i
would
go
for
more
if
i
could
get
it
locally
very
tasty
stuff
that
i
would
love
to
try
fresh
a
welcome
sight
as
the
end
of
winter
approaches
a
dark
body
cap
breifly
by
a
cream
head
that
sinks
back
in
quite
a
smell
of
malt
and
fruit
with
some
roasted
notes
taste
slightly
berry
on
top
of
a
wave
of
malts
that
are
very
well
coplimentory
it
could
be
quite
a
unique
blend
of
malts
that
provides
the
almost
blueberry
type
flavor
this
is
qutie
enjoyale
and
with
a
soft
dense
body
it
makes
for
good
drinking
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
14
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
and
intense
wheat
scent
that
smells
of
cloves
it
also
has
a
malty
side
that
boasts
of
chocolate
and
crystal
malts
it
is
fruity
with
wheat
but
dry
and
roasted
with
black
malts
very
nice
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
dry
and
roasted
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
warms
a
bit
on
the
finish
it
is
rich
with
chocolate
malts
which
give
it
a
dark
character
the
fruity
clove
taste
is
evident
but
little
in
comparison
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
little
less
than
adequate
carbonation
this
is
probably
the
best
weizenbock
ive
ever
had
it
has
a
great
malt
bill
along
with
aroma
and
taste
it
needs
a
little
more
carbonation
but
it
drinks
well
just
the
same
clearly
not
a
bad
beer
as
the
ratings
will
attest
but
maybe
not
for
everyone
give
it
a
shot
though
one
hint
though
do
not
drink
this
after
any
other
beer
i
made
this
the
2nd
beer
of
the
night
one
night
and
it
lost
a
lot
that
cinnamonbuttered
toast
i
spoke
of
in
the
aroma
came
through
a
lot
and
it
definitely
made
the
beer
seem
worse
then
having
it
solo
enjoy
it
as
the
only
or
at
least
1st
beer
of
the
night
and
youll
be
fine
from
the
bottle
poured
amber

this
is
good
quite
good
but
im
not
sure
its
quite
at
the
level
that
some
claim
it
to
be
i
really
like
the
chocolate
character
but
i
miss
the
phenols
it
also
didnt
seem
to
increase
in
richness
or
quality
as
it
warmed
not
dissappointing
as
a
beer
but
only
in
the
expectations
the
high
scores
had
lead
me
too
this
years
aroma
is
a
bit
odd
getting
black
malt
with
some
freshly
ground
coffee
there
is
that
spicy
clovy
wheat
beer
undertone
her
but
the
coffee
overpowers
smooth
body
with
not
much
carbonation
wants
to
be
chewy
at
times
but
is
held
back
has
a
dry
lingering
aftertaste
just
making
you
drink
more
very
drinkable
but
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
last
bottle
of
last
years
and
see
if
it
really
did
change
still
pretty
good
altogether
an
extremely
enjoyable
brew
not
as
rich
and
complex
as
a
dark
wheat
beer
like
aventinus
but
because
of
that
its
much
more
drinkable
easy
to
have
several
over
the
course
of
an
evening
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
a
seasonal
brew
because
i
could
drink
this
all
year
long
thanks
to
ronfromjersey

this
dandy
beer

pours
a
twofinger
tan
head
over
a
pitch
black
liquid
even
when
held
to
the
light
the
last
bit
was
swirled
to
add
any
sediment
into
the
beer
i
can
smell
sweetness
and
dark
malt
eminating
from
the
glass
as
it
just
sits
there
on
the
table
closer
sniffing
reveals
potent
chocolate
and
molasses
plus
some
vanilla
tastes
great
starts
with
molasses
and
grainy
goodness
some
melon
in
the
sweet
start
and
then
a
gentle
dap
of
roast
grains
come
in
followed
by
a
nice
bock
character
the
start
has
lotsa
flavor
plus
a
rounded
floral
hop
sort
of
a
fuggles
quality
but
this
is
in
the
german
style
so
i
would
be
surprised
this
beer
is
not
dry
but
not
wet
either
with
the
bock
comes
the
gentle
roast
not
coffee
and
not
strong
but
mixing
really
well
with
the
overall
sweet
with
searching
i
can
find
alcohol
at
a
consistent
level
throughout
wow
this
beer
is
really
well
balanced
what
a
fine
offering
great
carbonation
too
fluffy
bubbles
form
on
my
tongue
not
sharp
acid
creating
bubbles
like
so
many
other
beers
ive
reviewed
recently
no
lacing
but
there
is
still
a
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
liquid
with
the
last
gulp
thick
body
for
this
fantastic
beer
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
dissapates
was
poured
into
a
snifter
a
good
glass
to
capture
the
wonderful
aromas
malt
and
deep
brandylike
fruit
exciting
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
a
complex
mix
of
caramel
malt
and
wheat
with
nuts
and
fruit
topped
off
with
spice
goes
down
smooth
with
a
sweet
dryness
that
lingers
hides
the
abv
well
and
warms
just
right
balanced
complexity
and
satisfying
thanks

you

butler
nj
who
would
of
thought
my
mind
turns
to
road
trip
north
growler
and
cooler
in
the

what
an
aroma
theres
so
much
packed
in
there
chocolate
vanilla

heavily
creamed
coffee
wow
i
could
smell
this
beer
for
hours
outstanding
thick
and
substantial
mouthfeel
slight
alcohol
warming
low
carbonation
dizzying
complexity
this
is
a
hell
of
a
beer
it
proves
just
how
great
a
wheat
beer
can
be
very
deep
chestnut
brown
body
with
almost
no
head
only
a
light
brown
ring
aroma
lets
anticipate
a
rather
thick
beer
and
holds
all
kinds
of
malt
subtleties
smoky
licorice
chocolate
hints
of
coffee
and
wheat
and
just
any
dark
fruit
you
can
name
or
not
very
fruity
palate
the
malt
profile
is
actually
quite
sweet
feeling
like
brown
sugar
at
times
but
the
supervising
smokiness
comes
in
handy
to
ensure
this
never
gets
cloying
the
fruit
character
is
just
splendid
chewy
plums
and
fresh
black
berries
this
is
a
garden
id
like
to
possess
carbonation
is
rather
low
to
style
but
i
enjoy
it
that
way
and
the
medium
body
just
carries
the
flavor
like
a
pro
spectacular
and
stunning
every
way
i
look
at
it
absolutely
blinding
me
of
any
potential
critics
whilst
still
a
very
good
very
solid
beer
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
ramsteins
winter
wheat
a
beer
held
in
high
regard
by
many
it
pours
with
a
deep
dark
brown
body
and
a
very
thin
head
that
sort
of
hangs
around
for
a
while
as
carbonation
bubbles
to
the
top
of
the
brew
the
smell
is
different
but
still
very
nice
and
very
inviting
there
is
a
slight
cherry
note
along
with
some
wood
malt
wheat
alcohol
and
caramel
with
some
licorice
perhaps
the
flavour
is
full
yet
quite
subdued
at
times
theres
a
dry
maltbread
flavour
throughout
that
is
complimented
by
berries
and
other
subtle
sweetness
toward
the
finish
where
some
warming
alcohol
also
comes
through
which
by
the
way
while
noticeable
the
abv
is
hardly
recognizable
at
those
levels
beware
overall
a
nice
tasty
wickedly
smooth
brew
just
nothing
groundbreaking
definitely
give
it
a
try
just
dont
overhype
it
before
you
try
it
and
itll
be
that
much
better
wyll
drinkability
its
a
huge
delcious
beer
with
layers
and
layers
of
flavors
and
smells
i
couldnt
have
one
after
another
but
one
a
night
wouldnt
kill
anyone
it
would
go
great
sitting
aside
a
giant
steak
or
burger
or
as
an
after
dinner
drink
this
beer
rocks
notes
having
heard
of
the
winter
wheat
from
ramstein
but
never
checking
to
see
what
the
style
was
i
was
very
surprised
when
i
first
tried
it
the
first
thing
i
thought
was
aventinus
but
better
i
was
right
a
great
beer
and
one
id
love
to
have
again
thanks
to
ppoitras
for
this
gem
very
dark
brown
in
hue
if
not
black
in
the
middle
around
the
edges
there
was
a
slim
brown
highlight
there
wasnt
much
change
in
color
when
held
to
a
light
i
am
impressed
the
head
was
beige
in
color
at
the
summit
the
head
was
only
a
half
finger
in
height
after
a
brief
moment
it
slid
to
a
small
cap
this
cap
lasted
for
about
half
of
the
consumption
before
it
disappeared
completely
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
after
rwws
masterful
appearance
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
at
the
nose
yes
the
actual
aromas
are
nice
but
there
isnt
much
potency
i
wanted
this
beer
to
scream
at
me
not
whisper
it
isnt
too
cold
but
i
will
return
to
the
bouquet
at
room
temperature
maybe
it
will
improve
i
decided
to
sip
even
though
i
only
got
a
vague
impression
from
the
nose
i
was
rewarded
it
is
tasty
simply
tasty
it
is
every
bit
as
good
as
aventinus
weizeneisbock
maybe
better
even
but
not
that
much
better
the
palate
shows
great
depth
upfront
is
weizen
qualities
yummy
banana
flavors
really
shine
some
pepper
too
with
a
stray
hint
of
clove
shortly
after
these
flavors
i
detect
some
wheat
characteristics
but
they
are
short
lived
in
the
middle
comes
a
rush
of
alcohol
which
burns
down
the
weizen
part
like
a
phoenix
a
new
beer
rises
with
eisbock
qualities
there
is
a
dark
fruitiness
raisins
plums
and
such
it
is
plenty
malty
soft
chocolate
notes
more
cloves
figs
heat
and
caramelized
roastiness
amazing
stuff
here
with
plenty
of
flavor
nuances
i
returned
to
the
nose
at
room
temperature
still
the
bouquet
isnt
that
strong
the
aromas
of
bubblegum
fruitcake
wood
chocolate
covered
cherries
and
sweet
maltiness
are
present
but
not
loud
maybe
i
was
expecting
too
much
regardless
the
nose
is
inviting
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
immensely
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
typical
for
the
style
medium
in
body
with
low
but
natural
carbonation
it
feels
comfortable
this
is
amazingly
drinkable
even
though
i
can
taste
the
alcohol
i
would
never
have
guessed
the
abv
was
9
5
dangerous
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
on
all
accounts
damn
was
it
good
i
wish
i
had
many
many
more
thank
you
sulldaddy
for
the
bottle
overall
an
amazing
beer
with
both
great
complexity
and
great
drinkability
i
would
love
to
have
this
around
all
the
time
ramstein
winter
wheat
is
clearly
a
wellcrafted
weizenbock
and
is
a
beer
that
i
recommend
without
reservation
its
more
than
worthy
enough
for
my
300th
review
a
big
thank
you
to
dantes
for
providing
mahogany
black
with
a
faded
khaki
head
thats
airy
and
fleeting
licorice
in
the
aroma
with
a
slight
bubblegum
ester
note
backing
it
up
theres
a
lot
of
complexity
in
the
flavor
with
chocolate
an
interesting
cross
of
tea
and
coffee
charcoal
and
more
of
those
bubblegum
esters
the
taste
is
different
from
any
wheat
that
ive
had
before
with
a
definite
bitterness
that
doesnt
seem
to
come
from
the
hops
it
is
yeasty
but
there
are
hints
of
bitter
fruit
and
clove
there
is
a
hop
taste
at
the
end
but
it
is
slightly
different
than
the
normal
hop
bitterness
it
is
a
fullbodied
beer
with
a
smooth
feel
on
the
palate
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
always
want
another
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
reddish
hue
and
a
tan
quickly
diminishing
head
with
nice
lacing
aroma
of
wheat
yeast
bananasncream
and
clove
spice
nice
spicy
weizenbock
banana
and
clove
taste
with
a
mild
alcohol
tingle
on
the
tongue
i
am
not
quite
sure
if
this
lives
up
to
the
hype
though
it
is
still
a
nice
beer
first
sip
reveals
small
yet
fizzy
carbonation
that
fades
as
the
beer
warms
i
can
only
describe
the
body
as
juicy
flavor
is
very
tasty
with
fruity
cherry
hits
mixing
with
yeast
flavors
that
create
a
combination
that
reminds
me
of
scones
very
drinkable
and
no
hint
of
the
alcohol
in
this
bad
boy
terriffic
beer
quite
different
from
other
weizenbocks
ive
had
while
this
is
a
departure
from
the
style
its
still
a
very
good
brew
and
something
i
would
easily
buy
again
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
not
complex
but
lightbodied
and
easy
to
drink
pours
out
a
deep
dark
almost
black
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
this
is
a
big
beer
flavor
profile
is
huge
nice
and
malty
and
very
well
balanced
wheres
the
9
5
not
in
the
flavor
thats
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
beautiful
the
best
wheat
bock
ive
ever
sampled
thank
you
elguapo
for
the
samples
pours
thick
not
letting
much
light
through
if
any
hold
on
let
me
go
grab
my
spectrometer
yep
i
was
right
opaque
deep
chestnut
brown
lucious
fine
bubbly
tan
head
leaves
some
sporadic
spots
of
lacing
aromatics
flowing
here
an
amazing
mildly
smokey
chocolate
malt
characteristic
talk
about
creativity
this
is
the
epitat
banana
and
cloves
sharp
wheat
malt
sweetness
is
there
somewhere
what
a
complex
wheat
beer
i
now
fully
understand
why
this
beer
holds
its
own
on
the
best
of
ba
as
it
warms
alcohol
and
more
intense
over
ripened
fruit
tones
arise
nice
its
hard
to
sip
on
considering
you
could
just
sit
here
and
smell
the
damn
beer
all
day
and
be
just
as
happy
but
cant
let
it
go
to
waste
can
we
a
barrage
of
different
but
cohesive
flavors
wow
a
flight
of
chocolate
smoked
malts
comes
over
the
palate
then
this
flavor
is
eased
by
the
traditional
yeast
spawning
tones
of
banana
and
clove
sugar
sweet
twang
and
sharp
tone
of
the
unmalted
wheat
used
here
great
stuff
cant
get
over
it
one
bottle
is
a
tease
here
with
a
lucious
full
bodied
weizenbock
like
this
and
perfect
carbonation
youre
going
to
want
to
look
into
a
case
or
at
the
least
a
sixpack
who
are
these
guys
high
point
wheat
beer
co
i
need
to
find
the
brewpub
in
my
beer
journeys
intense
flavorful
near
orgasmic
experience
with
this
beer
no
hype
needed
this
beer
speaks
for
itself
great
stuff
big
zap
this
stuff
is
the
bomb
thanks
bitch
thank
you
to
schoolteacher
for
this
difficulttofind
beer
a
much
more
dry
but
more
rich
beer
than
the
aventinus
and
good
in
its
own
way
couldnt
state
a
clear
favorite
between
the
two
absolutely
one
ill
be
looking
forward
to
come
next
year
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
gate
in
brooklyn
dark
and
powerful
lots
of
fruit
and
yeast
in
the
nose
burnt
flavors
yeast
and
bready
notes
alcohol
obviously
present
but
well
in
the
background
of
this
finely
crafted
brew
this
style
continues
to
grow
on
me
strangly
refreshing
complex
interesting
drinkable
and
strong
at
the
same
time
pours
a
deep
black
ruby
color
with
a
short
thick
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
into
a
nice
lace
nose
is
dominated
by
aromas
of
dark
fruit
with
some
underlying
notes
of
clove
and
green
apples
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
slightly
syrupy
texture
taste
is
sweet
caramelized
malts
with
notes
of
dark
bread
and
unsweetened
chocolate
followed
by
some
fruitiness
black
currents
and
dark
cherries
and
a
touch
of
drying
alcohol
the
abv
is
so
well
hidden
that
its
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
this
beer
checks
in
at
9
5
thanks
to
jcalbi
for
the
sample
this
one
tops
the
charts
as
far
a
drinkability
is
concerned
just
respect
this
beer
big
thanks
to
biruchan
and
schoolteacher
for
this
outstanding
experience
in
beer
drinking
biruchan
and
schoolteacher
are
oh
so
good
to
me
quite
an
impressive
brew
its
amazing
that
this
is
9
5
abv
it
tastes
like
its
4
0
the
only
time
you
realize
it
has
a
higher
than
average
alcohol
content
is
when
it
warms
your
belly
after
the
swallow
i
really
liked
this
one
and
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
around
where
i
live
i
just
had
ramstein
winter
wheat
yesterday
at
david
copperfields
in
the
city
it
was
a
special
event
with
the
high
point
wheat
beer
company
they
had
the
winter
wheat
on
tap
from
a
cask
although
winter
wheat
is
normally
a
good
beer
it
was
significantly
better
out
of
the
cask
the
smell
and
taste
were
magnified
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
to
experience
this
dont
pass
it
up
big
bubbled
froathy
dirty
brown
colored
head
that
faded
to
a
thin
rim
of
head
the
beer
is
dark
cola
black
in
color
cloves
banana
and
mellow
dark
fruit
make
up
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolatey
wheat
beer
it
has
moderate
body
and
a
fairly
clean
taste
that
fades
in
the
aftertaste
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
for
such
a
strong
beer
very
powerful
this
is
a
contender
for
thickest
body
ever
you
feel
like
you
need
a
spoon
to
drink
it
sweet
but
not
even
close
to
cloying
this
is
one
hell
of
a
winter
warmer
i
think
i
may
enjoy
it
more
when
young
perhaps
some
of
the
phenolic
flavor
would
add
just
a
bit
more
depth
i
really
enjoy
the
woody
yeast
and
mocha
blend
it
has
a
very
old
school
feel
probably
because
of
the
woody
nutty
flavor
very
nice
edit
the
fruity
flavors
are
drawn
out
considerably
with
warmth
as
well
as
the
clove
id
recommend
warming
this
to
well
past
celler
temperature
in
order
to
get
a
fuller
experience
its
too
bad
i
was
more
than
halfway
through
when
it
reached
this
point
fantastic
lingering
fruit
and
coffee
aftertaste
dangerously
drinkable
and
exceptionally
well
made
very
cellerable
in
bottles
for
24
years
a
super
big
thanks
goes
to
fishbone
for
sending
out
some
extra
for
me
to
have
for
after
the
holidays
what
a
karmarific
guy
thanks
pours
a
super
dark
brown
with
a
medium
sized
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaves
little
lace
on
the
glass
aromas
of
apple
banana
dark
malts
and
pumpernickel
bread
come
to
me
very
interesting
taste
with
both
sweet
and
minor
sour
highlights
front
has
sweet
maybe
chocolate
malt
yeasty
bready
falvors
and
the
back
has
a
sort
of
semisour
finish
sort
of
a
sour
apple
hint
for
some
reason
the
balance
on
this
beer
is
tremendous
and
the
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
i
need
to
get
to
this
brewery
next
time
im
home
i
can
favorably
compare
this
to
aventinus
not
quite
as
yeasty
or
quite
as
tasty
overall
but
pretty
good
all
around
effort
it
is
really
really
dark
in
flavor
more
so
than
most
dunkel
weizens
the
flavor
is
terrific
and
its
one
of
the
better
americanmade
sample
of
the
style
this
is
one
amazing
brew
i
couldnt
put
it
down
even
knowing
it
was
going
to
put
me
on
my
arse
if
i
didnt
slow
down
it
was
hard
to
imagine
this
beer
having
a
abv
of
9
5
big
thanks
to
davo
for
bringing
a
real
treat
out
to
socal
we
should
be
seeing
this
in
the
best
of
ba
real
soon
i
should
think
it
seems
to
be
getting
more
wellknown
and
it
really
lives
up
to
its
high
rating
very
deep
brown
color
but
its
so
thick
that
nothing
comes
through
it
light
thin
tan
head
interesting
aroma
and
flavors
some
that
you
usually
dont
find
together
like
a
grassy
wheat
aroma
mixed
with
a
dark
chocolate
flavor
light
touch
of
vanilla
extract
and
alcohol
in
the
nose
as
for
that
alcohol
i
would
never
expect
9
5
from
the
taste
or
smell
but
youll
feel
it
once
you
near
the
bottom
of
your
glass
cloves
chocolate
and
spices
all
abound
in
this
wonderful
creation
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
thanks
to
elguapo
for
hookin
me
up
with
this
long
awaited
brew
venom
loren
was
right
you
need
to
do
anything
you
can
to
get
this
stuff
a
dark
brown
nearly
black
nearly
opaque
looking
brew
with
an
excellent
head
of
tan
foam
that
unfortunately
dies
early
and
leaves
little
in
the
lacing
department
the
aromas
are
all
there
and
all
all
classic
cloves
vanilla
banana
other
fruits
and
spices
with
a
distinctly
flavorful
wheatyyeastiness
to
it
as
well
the
taste
is
an
almost
euphoric
blend
of
wheat
flavors
coupled
with
chocolate
dark
german
chocolate
cherries
berries
spices
and
more
the
mouthfeel
is
super
creamy
and
excellent
but
not
perfect
the
drinkability
however
is
perfect
and
the
fact
that
this
brew
is
nearly
10abv
just
absolutely
blows
my
mind
thanks
for
the
tip
loren
wonderful
stuff
here
the
new
aventinus
on
the
block
2002
vintage
reddish
black
in
color
with
small
light
brown
head
very
malty
aroma
with
alcoholcloves
and
smoke
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
very
nice
creamy
texture
holding
bitter
chocolate
with
caramel
flavors
finishing
long
with
flavors
of
nutssmoke
and
sweet
malt
and
spicy
yeast
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
its
size
and
strength
a
very
good
night
cap
brew
im
thinking
it
may
go
perfect
with
pumpkin
pie
it
feels
crisp
and
carbonationated
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
i
prefer
to
sip
it
i
wish
i
had
more
than
just
the
one
oh
well
this
is
one
enjoyable
beer
happy
holidays
on
the
pour
a
deep
brown
to
black
with
some
ruby
high
lights
and
the
head
modest
in
size
creamy
in
texture
and
the
color
a
dark
tan
with
the
lace
a
thick
and
glutinous
sheet
to
seal
off
the
glass
for
view
ah
that
smell
sweet
wheat
cloves
and
a
hint
of
licorice
also
some
toasted
tones
noticed
quite
a
sniffer
this
one
start
is
sweet
and
thick
the
top
middling
in
feel
finish
is
benignly
acidic
and
the
hops
mild
and
pleasant
in
their
spiciness
with
the
aftertaste
bone
dry
and
a
fine
beer
ive
wanted
to
try
notes
an
amazing
brew
i
would
have
guessed
7
0
abv
not
9
5
very
deceiving
so
luscious
in
the
mouth
and
so
drinkable
for
a
big
beer
a
topnotch
brew
in
my
book
not
only
for
the
style
but
for
a
winter
seasonal
cheers
thanks
davo

see
ya
soon
mate
another
terrific
new
jersey
brew
compliments
of
beerfan
this
weizenbock
poured
opaque
black
with
almost
no
foam
the
smell
was
a
very
nice
mellow
banana
and
slightly
sweet
malt
aroma
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
wheat
the
taste
was
sweet
but
also
slightly
tart
the
dominant
flavors
were
malt
banana
caramel
and
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
mellow
and
creamy
and
fruity
the
body
was
medium
with
low
carbonation
the
finish
was
very
light
and
clean
this
was
quite
a
nice
beer
that
almost
looked
like
a
stout
but
tasted
like
a
wheat
beer
the
alcohol
content
was
deceptive
and
was
not
discernable
by
taste
a
pleasant
aroma
of
subtle
dark
roasted
malt
and
caramel
greeted
me
from
the
glass
dark
brownblack
in
color
with
a
light
brown
head
sweet
caramel
and
hints
of
wheat
came
through
and
really
surprised
me
mouthfeel
was
interesting
in
that
it
was
quite
chewy
dont
know
a
better
way
to
describe
it
very
nice
you
rarely
get
to
sample
a
beer
as
finely
crafted
as
this
dark
opaque
reddish
brown
phat
creamy
tan
head
wafting
combination
of
hefe
banana
clove
old
ale
dark
fruits
cherry
nuts
and
porter
roasted
grains
aromas
tastes
are
the
same
combination
with
some
caramelly
malt
sweetness
appearing
delivered
via
a
medium
bodied
yet
velvety
mouthfeel

alc
couldve
fooled
me
staggeringly
drinkable
a
big
thanks
to
my
beer
friend
whos
always
watching
my
back
veyr
different
for
a
wheat
beer
no
real
head
formed
semed
odd
for
a
wheat
beer
smelled
of
currants
and
raisins
and
plums
very
dark
almost
opaque
black
it
was
smooth
yet
fruity
for
a
wheat
beer
and
the
body
very
thick
a
very
warming
ale
that
was
just
different
for
this
wheat
beer
geek
originally
sampled
on
17
may
2003
looks
like
a
porter
but
doesnt
taste
like
one
it
has
a
slightly
fruity
aroma
w
a
flavor
of
tart
cherries
brown
bread
it
is
velvety
on
the
tongue
w
a
slightly
sweet
finish
this
is
a
great
brew
thanks

the
winter
wheat
pours
imperial
stout
black
with
a
spritzy
fizzy
head
of
the
shortestlived
bubbles
this
side
of
cola
actually
this
beer
looks
quite
a
bit
like
flat
coke
that
went
strong
on
the
syrup
a
big
caramelly
molasses
nose
with
hints
of
either
dates
or
dried
plums
in
addition
to
cloves
chocolate
and
toasted
malts
is
a
welcoming
start
to
the
nonvisual
attributes
of
this
beer
is
that
a
bit
of
smoke
too
yup
a
sip
confirms
that
there
is
indeed
a
hint
of
phenolic
smokiness
threading
through
the
cinnamon
raisins
figs
molasses
chocolate
cloves
and
bananas
damn
this
stuff
is
complex
i
love
the
fact
that
it
starts
off
tasting
almost
like
an
underhopped
imperial
stout
but
then
the
wheat
beer
yeast
kicks
in
and
takes
us
on
a
new
road
which
serves
as
a
magical
shortcut
between
munich
and
st
petersburg
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
though
it
can
be
felt
eventually
cant
be
tasted
any
more
than
in
a
5
helles
the
shockingly
low
hopping
rate
manages
to
account
for
any
molecule
of
maltose
headed
from
the
balanced
side
of
the
equation
to
the
cloying
side
this
beer
really
displays
finesseit
captures
all
thats
good
about
hefeweizen
and
imperial
stoutporter
without
losing
balance
complexity
or
my
interest
great
beer
surprisingly
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
but
when
held
up
to
the
light
some
ruby
tinges
shown
through
the
light
coffee
colored
head
thinned
out
pretty
quick
nice
roasty
aroma
with
fermented
fruitiness
there
along
with
coffee
and
caramel
the
taste
is
interesting

fruity
sweet
complex
and
somewhat
malty
does
not
show
the
typical
wheat
characteristics
like
sourness
bananas
or
cloves

the
sweetness
seems
to
overwhelm
any
of
that
beer
is
blended
nicely
and
is
very
flavorful
it
pushes
the
sweetness
envelope
for
me
but
tasty
and
drinkable
nevertheless
cheers
to
the
victory
ba
exchange
for
the
sample
a
thank
you
goes
out
to
davo
for
sending
me
this
one
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
dark
port
wine
color
deep
dark
and
rubypurple
colored
and
when
held
to
the
light
very
little
passed
through
the
glass
just
on
the
edges
you
could
see
some
red
highlights
i
swear
it
looked
like
dark
grape
juice
with
red
highlights
the
head
the
it
produced
was
a
medium
tanbrown
color
that
produced
a
thick
head
that
lasted
only
a
moment
then
faded
to
a
thin
ring
and
covering
on
the
surface
no
lace
seemed
to
be
present
the
aromas
that
came
from
this
beer
were
big
and
sweet

dark
fruits
sweet
malts
apples
caramel
floral
hops
and
some
spices
the
tastes
that
came
from
this
wheat
beer
were
big
and
surprising
i
tasted
creamy
chocolates
dark
fruits
apples
sweet
malts
spices
some
alcohol
wheat
grains
and
some
ash
dryness
this
beer
was
creamy
and
full
of
fruit
flavors
i
really
enjoyed
it
it
through
me
a
little
because
the
colors
flavors
and
tastes
were
different
from
what
i
am
used
to
in
a
wheat
beer
excellent
nice
and
warming
this
beer
is
like
a
kamaeleon
in
taste
and
smell
it
just
has
such
a
smooth
transition
from
flavor
to
flavor
smell
to
smell
kind
of
like
willy
wonkas
magical
gum
that
turns
the
girl
into
the
blueberry
well
i
didnt
turn
into
wheat
toast
so
looks
like
high
point
has
worked
out
the
problems
in
their
magical
potion
518
after
i
thought
i
wasnt
going
to
be
able
to
find
any
more
this
season
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
it
at
beerfans
store
9

i
can
hardly
believe
it
pours
mud
under
a
thin
bonnet
of
malted
milk
like
eating
a
banana
split
next
to
a
roaring
hardwood
campfire
the
nose
is
a
sublime
melange
of
banana
cherries
vanilla
chocolate
and
smoked
malts
a
man
could
go
to
slavering
before
he
even
takes
a
sip
more
treats
for
the
buds
as
i
quaff
this
chocolate
covered
banana
explosion
thats
somewhat
held
in
check
by
what
has
to
bebut
is
not
perceived
asa
huge
dose
of
balancing
hops
a
thin
wisp
of
smokiness
hangs
out
like
a
middleschool
drug
pusher
are
there
smoked
malts
in
this
brew
there
has
got
to
be
what
an
ambrosial
beer
unique
and
tasty
if
ramstein
gets
national
distribution
this
one
will
become
an
american
classic
for
sure
backwash
the
quintessential
qship
the
beer
equivalent
of
a
mercedes
300sel

oldworld
craftsmanship
silky
smooth
with
some
serious
torque
under
the
hood
midnight
brown
with
some
slight
ruby
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
topped
by
a
frothy
tan
head
which
breaks
down
a
bit
quick
aroma
of
dark
fruits
smoke
a
bit
of
cocoa
and
at
the
end
a
sweet
apple
scent
across
the
tongue
black
currant
and
assorted
fruits
roll
richly
and
slickly
sweet
but
by
no
means
cloying
near
10
alcohol
unnoticeale
except
for
a
trace
in
the
aftertaste
scarily
drinkable
hard
to
find
this
year
but
worth
the
hunt
pours
a
naturally
cloudy
very
dark
brown
body
with
a
huge
creamy
tan
head
that
holds
exceptionally
well
and
leaves
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
sweetish
and
fruity
berries
cherry
with
a
lightly
smoky
phenolic
in
the
background
the
body
is
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
the
flavor
offers
some
distinct
caramelized
sugars
a
soft
chocolatey
note
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
some
dull
bubblegum
it
finishes
fairly
short
and
lightly
sweet
although
its
not
a
complex
beer
it
is
quite
flavorfull
and
extremely
enjoyable
highly
recommended
and
well
worth
seeking
out
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
medium
tan
colored
head
the
smell
is
of
cocoa
and
reminds
me
of
banana
nut
bread
the
flavor
also
reminds
me
of
banana
nut
bread
with
a
smooth
but
present
alcohol
finish
this
is
a
very
solid
doppelbock
and
i
will
head
to
the
brewery
first
chance
i
get
i
wanna
see
these
guys
at
work
really
drinkable
for
a
strong
complex
beer
proud
to
be
from
jersey
got
this
during
sf
beer
week
from
a
tap
super
delicious
very
complex
strong
beer
would
love
to
try
it
again
overall
a
good
beer
not
my
favorite
german
style
but
a
good
beer
none
the
less
feel
sharp
light
body
mouthfeel
is
mild
but
a
little
still
overall
not
bad
at
all
but
not
really
my
style
which
is
not
a
surprise
doppelbock
is
a
tricky
style
to
get
right
weizenbock
perhaps
even
more
so
and
aventinus
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
so
i
am
even
more
let
down
by
this
offering
from
deschutes
than
i
might
have
otherwise
been
this
pours
a
light
tan
with
manila
foam
theres
a
light
clove
and
banana
character
on
the
aroma
with
a
dominant
banana
bubble
gum
taste
once
sipped
malty
sweet
and
strong
overall
a
big
strong
malt
bomb
of
a
beer
enjoyable
enough
but
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
would
have
again
worth
a
shot
especially
if
you
like
german
beers
to
begin
with
4
strange
initial
chemical
sweetness
that
turned
me
off
nice
and
boozy
though
and
i
got
over
the
sweetness
and
took
one
for
the
team
and
finished
the
bomber
pours
a
hazy
burntorange
in
color
with
a
good
1finger
beige
head
that
finally
settles
down
a
good
half
way
through
the
drink
to
around
2mm
or
so
lots
of
sticky
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
a
lot
going
on
with
the
aroma
and
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
banana
clove
bumble
gum
and
spices
pretty
much
the
same
for
the
taste
with
the
malts
right
up
front
followed
by
the
spices
followed
by
some
bubble
gun
flavor
with
yeast
and
more
malts
sweet
finish
as
would
be
excepted
for
this
type
of
brew
mediumbodies
with
perfect
carbonation
this
is
a
good
sipper
type
of
brew
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
for
sure
but
you
dont
taste
it
only
one
is
needed
lol
overall
a
tasty
brew
d
taste
like
211
but
without
kick
not
worth
the
money
just
go
ahead
and
get
a
40oz
of
211
and
save
8
overall
10
7
abv
does
not
suit
this
beer
at
all
the
flavors
are
too
over
the
top
sweet
likely
a
result
of
forcing
the
higher
alcohol
content
this
is
a
strong
pass
for
all
but
the
biggest
fans
of
the
style
doppel
dinkel
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
big
malty
beady
aroma
with
hints
of
ester
and
alcohol
the
taste
has
a
beady
flavor
ester
flavors
and
big
alcohol
flavors
strong
flavors
body
seems
a
little
flat
overall
its
big
and
flavorful
but
i
think
the
alcohol
may
be
too
powerful
o
im
torn
here
while
the
flavor
profile
offers
significant
complexity
it
also
heavily
features
a
twonote
barrage
of
pine
and
alcohol
to
me
while
the
mouthfeel
is
exactly
what
one
wants
out
of
a
weizenbock
in
consistency
the
carbonation
and
heat
are
a
bit
excessive
i
imagine
for
those
who
are
less
hopsensitive
than
i
am
this
is
an
outright
good
beer
i
am
left
wondering
if
i
would
repeat
it
given
the
opportunity
this
beer
was
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
blind
pig
mug
and
enjoyed
at
apx
50f
o
happy
to
finally
get
my
hands
on
this
one
more
german
style
dark
wheat
beer
rather
than
doppel
bock
than
i
was
expecting
but
quite
tasty
and
a
bit
of
an
ass
kicker
c
this
has
a
very
yeasty
flavor
typical
of
weizenbocks
but
with
a
depth
of
dark
malt
flavor
only
a
doppelbock
could
provide
this
is
a
nearperfect
rendering
of
a
dark
big
beer
in
my
opinion
with
a
focus
on
the
sweet
yeastiness
that
takes
away
from
the
alcohol
hotness
but
not
too
much
great
brew
for
sure
this
beats
any
big
stout
ive
tried
im
pretty
sure
o
its
a
good
beer
the
flavor
profile
is
ordered
in
a
nice
way
and
its
easy
to
drink
have
to
watch
out
on
this
one
with
the
high
abc
just
not
my
style
i
guess
those
belgian
yeast
flavors
can
be
a
real
turnoff
for
me
in
some
beers
the
nose
was
big
time
banana
and
clove
i
thought
the
yeast
did
play
well
with
the
malts
producing
an
aroma
reminiscent
of
banana
bread
also
raisins
and
cherries
a
little
bubblegum
it
poured
ruby
brown
with
a
white
head
and
it
was
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
on
the
palate
banana
and
clove
were
still
the
most
prevalent
bubblegum
that
banana
bread
thing
i
mentioned
cherry
and
some
spices
but
everything
aside
from
those
first
two
was
pretty
subtle
in
the
end
i
was
conflicted
with
this
beer
because
of
personal
preference
its
well
made
beer
good
overall
actually
its
just
not
for
me
this
is
a
big
beer
with
big
abv
and
big
flavor
it
starts
off
a
little
sweet
bubblegum
like
but
with
a
little
warmth
it
opens
up
to
resemble
a
quad
the
bubblegum
sweetness
subsides
and
a
raisin
date
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
takes
its
place
it
then
finishes
with
huge
matiness
the
feel
is
very
thick
with
a
little
viscosity
and
a
completely
hidden
abv
thanks
slatetank
for
sharing
this
with
me
pours
a
mahogany
color
with
a
big
bubble
composition
for
a
head
that
fades
quick
the
aroma
primarily
contains
a
sweetness
reminiscent
of
candy
toffee
raison
and
molasses
the
taste
is
similar
with
belgian
clove
and
peppery
spice
a
sticky
sweetness
and
almost
buttery
note
towards
the
finish
this
is
medium
bodied
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
decent
overall
medium
to
medium
full
body
suggests
liquid
bread
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
a
nice
bavarian
style
weizenbock
that
definitely
fits
in
the
style
22

served
in
a

the
beer
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
about
a
half
inch
light
tan
creamy
head
the
head
stays
around
a
while
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of

aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
cloves
banana
bubblegum
caramel
and
some
candied
oranges
i
think
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
bready
malt
and
a
sweet
spiciness
noticeable
too
mouthfeelbody
is

its
creamy
and

its

is
well
hidden
i
liked
this
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
i
know
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
another
bottle
of
this
the
flavor
has
malt
forward
profile
with
strong
bready
character
and
mild
sweet
caramel
with
hint
of
stone
fruit
and
slight
spicy
yeast
aspect
the
toffee
and
molassess
type
sweetness
w
deep
yeast
in
the
flavor
which
brings
a
currentlike
and
mild
fig
with
earthy
dark
sugar
flavor
and
mild
alcohol
as
it
warms
overall
i
really
liked
this
bock
nice
amount
of
wheat
malt
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
a
10
beer
with
nice
complexity
and
yeast
influence
i
would
buy
this
again
if
it
werent
10
per
bottle
but
dont
regret
paying
that
to
experience
it
once
serving
type
bottle
poured
on
the
orange
side
of
amber
smells
like
a
doppel
banana
double
bubble
cloves
sweet
malt
and
yeast
this
beer
realy
delivers
on
the
label
description
word
for
word
citrusy
with
subtle
banana
sweet
with
a
unique
malt
charachteristic
also
just
a
hint
of
spiceyness
at
the
tail
end
almost
like
a
cayene
pepper
perfect
body
and
you
would
never
know
that
it
is
almost
11
easily
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
in
this
style
seems
to
be
underrated
to
me
overall
a
very
good
twist
on
a
german
wheat
bock
good
mix
of
fruit
esters
and
spices
able
to
try
it
on
draft
to
go
for
it
very
good
indeed
cheap
either
o
on
one
hand
im
glad
this
isnt
a
yearround
offering
from
deschutes
because
id
be
too
far
gone
to
do
anything
if
it
was
as
this
is
the
most
easy
to
drink
doppel
i
think
ive
ever
had
on
the
other
hand
im
really
sad
it
isnt
a
yearround
beer
because
id
love
to
have
the
chance
to
snag
it
when
in
need
of
some
beer
psychotherapy
its
perfectly
balanced
rich
where
it
should
be
and
yielding
as
well
as
a
homebrewer
this
beer
makes
me
feel
like
i
should
brew
something
with
spelt
as
well
deschutes
scores
yet
another
goal
in
my
book
and
at
only
10
and
some
change
theres
absolutely
no
reason
to
pass
it
up
given
the
chance
to
try
it

kinda

id

would
want
and
the

didnt
wow
me
but
otherwise
excellent
a
truly
interesting

powerhouse

a

sips
is
all
i
can
do
at

they

additional
notes
the
deschutes
web
site
calls
this
an
imperial
spelt
beer
and
notes
that
a
traditional
german
ale
yeast
was
used
overall
this
is
a
unique
take
on
the
weizenbock
style
and
while
i
like
unique
takes
i
am
not
sure
i
fully
appreciate
the
use
of
smelt
or
the
overall
sweet
highly
alcoholic
notes
this
is
a
weizenbock
not
a
dopple
but
whatever
you
call
it
pretty
good
could
give
vitus
a
run
for
its
money
with
some
age
on
it
if
you
havent
cracked
it
let
it
rest
another
36
months
i
reckon
this
is
a
decent
stab
at
a
doppelbock
but
it
didnt
quite
reach
its
destination
interestingly
the
more
meladoidinladen
taste
of
bock
is
replaced
here
by
those
curiously
charming
hefeweizen
flavors
for
interest
and
provocation
overall
im
loving
this
beer
maybe
not
particularly
traditional
but
damn
damn
tasty
and
terrifyingly
drinkable
for
its
abv
fairly
murky
caramel
with
a
lingering
frothy
head
aromas
of
bubblegum
and
banana
are
not
what
i
expected
for
a
doppelbock
floral
notes
and
caramel
are
subtle
flavor
is
very
banana
dominant
with
underlying
citrus
notes
of
lemon
and
orange
become
more
pronounced
before
the
dry
bready
finish
a
little
hot
but
pretty
tasty
o
a
nice
aged
beer
definitely
not
a
stout
but
a
nice
strong
ale
i
thought
there
was
a
problem
with
our
bottle
but
more
knowledgable
guys
said
no
that
being
said
i
couldnt
get
into
the
flavor
a
slight
sour
twangfunky
nose
that
might
come
from
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
at
all
o
really
nice
complex
profile
lighter
than
expected
drinks
a
little
like
a
brownale
barleywine
hybrid
taste
actually
starts
out
on
a
slightly
sweet
edge
sweet
caramel
malt
with
touchings
of
vanilla
bourbon
is
once
again
subtle
which
is
good
in
that
it
doesnt
overpower
all
the
other
flavors
and
adds
some
nuances
body
is
a
touch
thin
lacking
some
of
the
other
flavors
of
a
typical
weizenbock
yet
present
bigger
flavors
that
arent
typically
present
bit
of
a
conundrum
in
this
respect
heat
makes
a
late
stage
presence
with
each
sip
so
its
not
distracting
when
it
counts
overall
for
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
this
is
not
bad
at
all
9
with
little
to
no
alcohol
taste
and
heat
is
a
plus
in
my
book
and
the
flavor
profile
is
interesting
as
a
weizenbock
well
this
isnt
one
if
it
was
the
essence
of
it
was
lost
during
aging
leaving
behind
just
a
sweet
smooth
bourbony
beer
hence
i
am
torn
on
how
to
rate
this
i
would
pick
this
up
again
on
occasion
as
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
fits
the
style
about
as
well
as
a
blower
for
a
57
chevy
fits
a
bopit
since
i
prefer
rating
to
stylistic
elements
over
personal
enjoyment
i
am
going
to
go
that
route
with
the
disclaimer
that
this
is
still
a
tasty
barrelaged
beer
just
not
a
weizenbock
per
se
deeply
flavorful
with
more
of
the
same
on
the
palate
bourbon
burnt
sugars
and
dark
chocolatemolasses
coming
to
mind
hearty
beer
for
a
cold
winters
day
drinks
pretty
nice
could
use
a
little
more
barrel
body
a
good
not
great
take
on
the
style
great
flavor
but
doesnt
quite
measure
on
the
other
elements
local
option
calls
this
a
weizenbock
so
i
rated
it
as
such
as
far
as
a
general
beer
its
another
decent
offering
of
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
with
no
particular
stylistic
characteristics
in
general
the
beer
just
exemplifies
bourbon
barrel
aging
as
it
hits
its
notes
subtlety
and
beautifully
the
beer
tastes
more
towards
a
strong
ale
or
american
barleywine
in
the
base
but
it
still
does
not
stand
much
in
the
way
of
the
barrel
expression
overall
really
pleasant
slightly
unusual
maltforward
bba
beer
a
really
surprising
amount
of
flavor
for
a
relatively
small
mouthfeel
really
nice
this
can
barely
be
called
a
weizenbock
it
has
none
of
the
characteristics
of
one
it
can
be
called
a
great
beer
however
its
closer
to
a
barrelaged
belgian
strong
dark
ale
or
a
barrel
aged
barleywine
those
two
arent
that
far
from
each
other
anyway
as
bmmillsys
review
states
i
didnt
think
it
handled
the
barreling
very
well
it
was
just
harsh
with
no
pleasantries
got
extrad
this
recently
in
a
big
trade
hooray
large
format
bottle
with
no
date
pours
dark
brown
and
settles
without
letting
much
of
any
light
through
in
the
glass
with
a
khaki
one
finger
head
definite
aroma
of
bourbon
huge
oak
presence
some
spice
not
much
else
here
pretty
bourbon
forward
nose
flavor
is
big
bourbon
notes
a
bit
harsh
a
little
vanilla
settles
with
a
little
bit
of
spice
and
then
a
long
caramel
vanilla
finish
with
lots
of
woodyness
somewhat
thin
on
the
body
medium
carbonation
yikes
these
sorts
of
beers
just
dont
handle
the
barrel
well
for
me
and
end
up
tasting
very
harsh
without
any
of
the
sweet
pleasant
nuance
of
the
bourbon
itself
not
getting
into
this
one

o
i
have
had
this
on
my
list
of
beers
to
try
for
a
long
time
and
wish
id
gotten
around
to
it
sooner
a
lot
of
the
character
of
a
traditional
doppelbock
maybe
it
should
be
called
la
petite
mortinator
with
the
barrel
aging
adding
some
rich
flavors
to
it
really
good
stuff
o
on
a
crisp
cool
midwest
evening
this
beer
is
perfect
dont
rush
into
drinking
this
one
open
a
bottle
share
with
a
buddy
and
enjoy
i
am
going
to
let
one
age
a
bit
to
see
how
the
flavors
in
this
beer
develop
over
time
lots
of
bourbon
here
both
in
the
aroma
and
in
the
taste
but
it
plays
well
with
the
base
beer
echoing
its
richness
vanilla
notes
and
restrained
sweetness
a
sipper
for
sure
but
one
that
keeps
drawing
you
on
very
nice
to
find
this
locally
because
of
the
local
option
connection
dark
thin
pour
not
much
carbonation
smell
is
corn
sweet
bourbon
taste
is
sweet
bourbon
pretty
thin
lots
of

overall
this

has
amazing
depth
and
is
a
real
treat
beautifully
done

a
nice
execution
of
a
style
that
seems
to
take
pretty
well
to
bourbon
barrel
aging
weizenbocks
already
have
some
pleasant
sweetness
naturally
so
the
complement
of
the
oak
and
the
contrast
of
the
residual
spirits
from
the
barrel
both
work
quite
well
ill
definitely
be
buying
more
of
this
since
it
just
seems
to
sit
around
on
shelves
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
a
big
and
warming
brew
this
is
very
good
o
hell
of
a
weizenbock
malty
to
the
extremely
like
drinking
liquid
bread
mixed
with
caramel
and
served
in
an
oaken
drinking
vessel
almost
too
much
at
times
definitely
a
sipper
but
great
strength
of
flavors
great
complexity
and
well
executed
perfect
fireside
drink
for
a
snowstorm
though
it
is
still
in
the
80s
here
o
this
was
a
sensational
beer
the
weizenbock
is
as
good
or
better
a
way
to
deliver
the
bourbon
flavors
than
a
stout
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
other
than
it
would
be
good
because
central
waters
was
involved
but
it
has
exceeded
my
expectations
a
high
alcohol
dive
into
a
maelstrom
of
coconut
raisins
bourbon
and
other
dark
fruits
truly
an
amazing
brew
which
must
be
experienced
sip
do
not
chug
savor
it
do
not
merely
knock
it
back
and
your
palate
shall
be
richly
rewarded
beyond
your
wildest
dreams
is
it
perfect
nah
but
its
a
damn
good
idea
and
an
interesting
experiment
well
worth
a
try
unique
to
say
the
least
some
of
it
worked
but
at
times
it
seemed
off

o
an
unusual
beer
how
often
do
you
hear
of
a
germanstyle
beer
being
bourbon
barrel
aged
very
complex
and
definitely
drinkable
overall
flavors
are
nice
despite
the
finish
quite
a
bit
of
barrel
poured
into
a
fremont
small
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
pitch
black
in
the
glass
with
a
fine
one
finger
light
brown
head
with
great
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
fine
aroma
of
bourbon
caramel
vanilla
dark
malt
dark
dried
fruit
not
getting
much
wheat
here
what
an
interesting
flavor
starts
very
much
like
a
bourbon
stout
but
it
quickly
becomes
clear
that
the
body
of
this
is
not
dark
toasted
malt
but
lighter
wheat
there
is
not
time
for
for
the
surprise
of
the
lighter
body
to
register
when
great
bourbon
and
vanilla
flavors
beging
to
dominate
the
flavor
finishes
with
more
vanilla
oak
and
bourbon
a
hint
of
booziness
but
enough
complexity
to
cover
it
medium
bodied
a
complete
surprise
and
not
like
anything
ive
tasted
before
the
depth
and
strength
of
the
bourbon
and
barrel
flavors
seem
too
much
for
anything
but
a
rich
malt
body
to
cover
but
this
is
wonderfully
balanced
and
somehow
the
wheat
is
up
to
the
task
little
bock
character
here
this
seems
more
like
an
imperial
hefeweizen
never
tried
one
but
this
is
what
id
imagine
on
bourbon
steroids
an
amazing
production
and
trying
reminds
me
of
the
pleasant
surprise
of
trying
a
bourbon
stout
for
the
first
time
excellent
and
world
class
maybe
im
a
sucker
for
bourbon
flavors
but
i
loved
this
poured
a
dark
brown
body
with
one
finger
head
that
stuck
around
forever
in
lace
ring
form
aroma
is
bourbonboozy
dark
fruits
like
black
cherry
and
figs
smooth
crisp
carbonation
fuller
body
from
yeast
also
has
a
creaminess
to
it
and
there
is
some
nice
sweetness
to
beer
comprised
of
vanilla
toffee
fig
caramel
good
balance
as
the
dark
fruits
black
cherry
figs
possible
raisins
balance
with
malty
sweetness
woodiness
and
slight
booziness
finishes
slick
and
easy
and
hides
the
alcohol
real
well
more
sweet
than
i
thought
a
dopple
could
be
and
really
works
t
lots
and
lots
of
bourbon
without
really
becoming
too
hot
beyond
that
though
im
really
not
getting
much
here
at
all
a
little
bit
of
toasted
walnut
oak
caramel
brown
sugar
and
just
a
hint
of
dryness
but
im
thinking
that
all
that
is
from
the
bourbon
the
mouthfeel
is
really
really
weak
the
bourbon
walks
all
over
the
beer
here
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
for
this
again
o
the
wheat
body
of
this
beer
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
you
cant
tell
that
the
underlying
beer
is
a
weizenbock
although
the
bourbon
is
quite
strong
it
doesnt
burn
your
mouth
overall
very
strong
bourbon
flavor
nice
medium
body
have
not
been
disappointed
by
central
waters
yet
overall
i
got
this
thinking
it
might
be
a
good
base
beer
to
let
the
bourbon
shine
and
add
some
complexity
but
to
me
it
comes
of
overly
sweet
and
a
mess
of
similar
tastes
o
aside
from
being
a
bit
bourbon
heavy
i
will
say
i
love
bourbon
aged
beers
and
this
is
an
excellent
beer
this
is
my
first
from
central
waters
and
local
option
and
ive
heard
great
things
about
central
waters
barrelaged
beers
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
theirs
i
love
belgium
style
of
ales
i
also
love
bourbon
barrel
aging
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
both
full
taste
that
feels
good
in
your
mouth
and
looks
good
good
head
that
stays
well
without
being
excessive
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
a
brew
from
a
brewing
company
i
hadnt
heard
of
or
tried
that
was
this
good
i
will
definitely
be
looking
for
more
i
really
wasnt
sure
how
this
would
come
out
for
a
barrel
aged
whiskey
weizenbock
but
its
lightness
and
thick
quality
is
astounding
with
the
flavors
melding
and
tasting
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
had
even
in
this
style
an
extremely
impressive
brew
o
i
cant
say
ive
ever
disliked
a
ba
offering
from
cw
very
good
for
the
style
though
i
would
still
prefer
a
good
ba
stout
or
scotch
ale
in
the
end
the
price
is
right
and
absolutely
worth
the
purchase
its
lightly
viscous
finish
makes
this
potent
ale
a
sipping
elixir
rather
than
a
drinkable
ale
meant
to
contend
with
port
sherry
and
madera
the
taste
and
potency
of
a
petite
mort
ensures
a
long
spicy
and
savory
finish
that
clings
to
the
taste
buds
in
strong
dessertlike
fashion
la
petite
morte
is
very
bourbon
heavy
and
possibly
masks
some
of
the
other
flavors
that
are
there
but
with
me
that
is
okay
the
bourbon
and
wood
flavors
are
very
well
integrated
with
central
waters
beers
and
i
havent
really
come
across
one
of
their
beers
in
which
that
doesnt
work
beyond
that
this
beer
has
a
decent
mix
of
candy
sugar
and
malts
as
i
said
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
the
barrel
aging
of
central
waters
makes
this
a
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
again
ive
had
a
few
of
these
and
this
is
my
last
one
from
the
cellar
i
tried
a
weizenbock
vitus
to
be
specific
to
really
enjoy
what
heaven
hill
barrels
can
do
for
this
i
think
this
is
harsher
at
colder
temps
and
come
to
really
dig
this
as
it
warms
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
on
the
onset
but
generally
comes
into
its
own
bold
and
audacious
overall
good
but
the
barleywine
and
bourbon
barrel
stout
offerings
are
better
from
cw
both
offer
more
complex
flavors
and
just
stand
out
more
amongst
their
peers
for
their
offerings
o
very
good
beer
i
would
say
this
really
trends
towards
a
barleywine
in
character
mild
estery
components
to
retain
some
of
the
weizenbock
character
but
the
bourbon
barrel
seems
to
mute
these
a
bit
and
bring
out
more
of
the
sweet
caramelized
sugary
components
quite
smooth
and
drinks
pretty
easy
la
petite
mort
pours
a
dark
brown
color
almost
black
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is

burbon
aroma
with

strong

strong

good

good
body
nice

overall
a
very
nice
complex
beer
lots
of
good
aged
like
flavors
o
glad
i
tucked
this
one
away
for
a
little
bit
it
was
quite
enjoyable
i
didnt
really
pick
up
much
in
the
way
of
belgian
characteristics
but
i
liked
what
was
going
on
here

ethanol
is
easily
felt
as
heat
in
the

burn
on

not

pleasant
closes
dry
and
somewhat
astringent
with
heavy

lingering
on

surprisingly
the
lighter
body
of
this
style
holds
the
bourbon
presence
very
well
an
interesting
beer
thats
certainly
worth
trying
overall
not
a
ton
going
on
in
this
one
but
its
pleasant
enough
but
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
another
example
of
a
barrelaged
brew
that
may
deliver
on
the
barrel
aspects
but
neglects
to
delight
in
any
other
area
overall
at
the
bottle
share
this
was
the
consensus
loser
it
tastes
like
central
waters
wanted
to
barrel
age
something
they
did
not
put
much
into
it
and
just
decided
to
ship
out
a
onesided
product
o
get
it
and
try
it
a
bit
different
and
very
drinkable
cw
makes
very
solid
good
beers
they
just
arent
in
the
omg
this
is
the
best
range
yet
great
brewery
overall
go
eagles
note
just
seeing
the
note
on
the
page
about
this
being
a
weizenbock
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
with
the
phenolic
aroma
and
the
massive
head
i
might
have
to
add
some
points
here
since
i
think
they
really
allowed
the
style
to
shine
well
enough
from
behind
the
barrel
aging
pours
a
murky
honey
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
vanilla
and
bourbon
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
caramel
vanilla
and
bourbon
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
woody
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
seems
almost
a
bit
watered
down
ive
only
had
two
barrelaged
weizenbocks
that
i
recall
both
have
been
excellent
natural
pairing
something
to
think
about
brewers
because
this
is
one
more
excellent
example
of
the
substyle
o
this
beer
is
solid
if
you
like
the
other
bourbon
barrel
beers
from
central
waters
you
will
like
this
while
i
like
it
im
starting
to
think
of
central
waters
as
a
one
trick
pony
when
it
comes
to
barrel
aged
beers
the
barrel
character
is
great
but
the
depth
of
the
flavors
are
lacking
poured
into
upland
snifter
pours
murky
brown
with
white
head
that
is
short
lived
no
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
bourbon
forward
with
huge
charred
oak
character
paired
with
vanilla
and
bourbon
this
is
paired
with
the
weizenbock
base
and
integrated
pretty
well
light
notes
of
wheat
and
ripe
fruit
sit
beneath
the
heavy
barrel
influence
taste
features
more
of
the
base
beer
with
notes
of
molasses
caramel
plums
and
figs
this
is
rounded
out
with
strong
vanilla
presence
and
a
touch
of
barrel
the
bourbon
never
gets
too
boozy
and
provides
a
nice
smooth
and
flavorful
brew
this
is
my
first
barrel
aged
weizenbock
and
i
must
say
that
it
makes
a
pretty
nice
vehicle
for
barrel
aging
has
good
barrel
influenced
flavor
but
that
is
about
all
there
is
to
taste
would
of
liked
to
experienced
a
more
complex
beer
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
bourbonand
maltforward
beer
fans
of
barrelaged
barleywines
will
enjoy
this
o
the
big
wonderful
barrel
flavor
is
complimented
by
sweet
dark
toasted
malts
and
caramel
malt
character
a
classic
pairing
o
disappointment
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
cw
and
this
is
by
far
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
from
them
i
surly
hope
there
was
some
handling
problem
between
bottling
and
my
drinking
to
explain
this
product
this
a
booze
filled
non
flavorful
super
sweet
maltiness
even
the
bourbon
tasted
poor
i
hate
saying
all
this
negativity
this
was
a
shock
o
this
beer
is
not
easy
to
find
and
i
stumbled
across
it
at
a
local
shop
a
bit
pricey
for
what
it
is
but
i
wanted
to
try
it
nothing
really
stands
out
as
the
weizenbock
took
on
all
the
characteristics
of
the
bourbon
barrel
i
dont
know
how
long
this
was
in
the
barrel
but
it
may
be
better
as
a
7030
blend
so
some
of
the
weizenbock
notes
are
present
i
guess
that
is
why
it
is
called
la
petite
mort
small
death
overall
pretty
decent
bourbon
barrel
beer
that
isnt
particularly
complex
and
it
would
be
for
the
people
who
love
drinking
their
whiskey
because
it
seems
like
its
basically
a
glass
of
sweetened
whiskey
i
would
appreciate
a
bit
more
complexity
here
even
a
bit
more
bitterness
as
well
o
all
signs
point
to
a
great
weizenbock
previous
to
the
barrel
the
bourbon
barrel
adds
tremendous
depth
great
look
to
this
aroma
only
teases
more
flavor
features
so
many
great
dimensions
all
working
great
the
perfect
body
is
a
bonus
o
reminds
of
a
taffy
apple
sweet
camel
malts
with
a
crisp
fruity
feel
its
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
good
blend
of
a
style
and
the
barrel
aging
d
this
thing
tastes
more
like
a
big
bourbon
barrel
aged
quad
or
dubbel
than
a
weizenbock
certainly
everything
works
well
here
however
i
am
struggling
to
find
wheat
bock
flavors
and
aromas
regardless
a
great
sipper
and
a
great
way
to
step
outside
the
normal
box
from
central
waters
i
applaud
the
courage
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
regardless
of
style
guidelines
pours
a
solid
dark
brownblack
with
a
tightly
bubbled
off
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
cap
on
top
this
smells
incredible
theres
so
much
going
on
here
dark
and
burnt
sugars
dried
prune
raisins
vanilla
sweet
bourbon
nutmeg
clove
and
a
hint
of
ethanol
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
quite
well
sweet
and
malty
with
darker
sugars
and
light
dried
fruit
up
front
vanilla
with
hints
of
wood
and
sweet
bourbon
mixed
with
some
spices
and
a
fair
amount
of
alcohol
that
is
present
but
not
harsh
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
weizenbock
is
probably
a
stretch
for
this
beer
it
more
belgian
dark
strong
imho
great
brew
anyhow
i
really
enjoyed
it
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
some
bruery
stuff
only
its
better
m
its
a
big
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
style
helps
with
thinner
mouth
nice
beer
dont
think
ive
ever
had
this
style
but
im
pretty
sure
barrelaging
can
make
anything
awesome
this
was
not
the
beer
i
was
expecting
but
im
sure
not
disappointed
cw
continues
to
impress
with
bourbonmalt
bombs
this
is
an
excellent
offering
picked
up
a
bottle
recently
at
discount
liquor
in
milwaukee
at
a
1
bottle
per
person
limit
release
it
pours
a
rich
mahogany
with
a
full
healthy
white
foamy
head
the
head
retention
on
this
one
is
really
nice
and
quite
honestly
its
a
really
beautiful
looking
beer
after
looks
though
everything
starts
to
go
somewhat
down
hill
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
of
this
weizenbock
are
intensely
dominated
by
the
flavorscent
of
bourbon
i
really
really
enjoy
weizenbocks
and
so
i
was
really
disappointed
the
bourbon
really
dominates
everything
very
strongly
and
many
of
the
natural
flavors
from
the
base
weizenbock
have
a
hard
time
peaking
there
way
through
now
dont
get
me
wrong
i
really
like
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
but
the
intensity
of
this
one
is
so
strong
that
it
actually
makes
it
somewhat
hard
to
enjoy
if
i
wanted
to
get
a
full
blast
of
bourbon
flavor
i
would
just
have
some
eagle
rare
on
the
rocks
i
really
would
like
to
try
the
regular
la
petite
morte
because
i
really
think
that
that
would
be
more
my
style
that
all
being
said
this
beer
is
still
decent
its
just
a
really
intense
sipper
pours
a
slight
darker
caramel
brown
capped
by
a
one
finger
cream
colored
head
speaking
of
caramel
there
a
bunch
on
the
nose
along
with
bourbon
and
hint
of
cocoa
a
lot
of
toasted
oak
vanilla
almond
toffee
caramel
a
touch
of
plum
and
raisin
finishes
really
smooth
with
continued
caramel
and
oaky
bourbon
low
gentle
carbonation
smooth
syrupy
full
body
with
a
hint
of
creaminess
id
never
guess
the
base
beer
is
a
weizenbock
tons
of
barrel
character
here
and
fairly
complex
a
completely
successful
collaboration
o
overall
a
good
bourbon
beer
but
it
tastes
about
like
youd
expect
doesnt
have
any
distinguishing
characteristics
that
make
it
a
weizenbock
o
i
love
the
aroma
of
this
beer
but
the
taste
just
doesnt
follow
also
the
thinner
mouthfeel
is
not
up
to
par
for
a
9
a
beer
for
my
liking
overall
this
is
1414
without
being
a
big
stout
just
a
different
beer
style
its
an
under
the
radar
brew
for
sure
the
barrel
notes
on
this
beer
are
fantastic
they
are
almost
identical
to
1414
i
cant
imagine
this
is
a
beer
thats
is
to
style
but
it
just
does
not
matter
its
a
wonderful
beer
its
is
honestly
a
pleasant
surprise
top
notch
job
on
this
beer
central
waters
only
drawback
that
i
could
come
up
with
is
the
muddled
finish
but
what
the
hell
this
is
awesome
all
the
best
parts
of
1414
but
easier
drinking
wow
thanks
4daloveofstout
overall
a
great
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
strong
but
enjoyable
overall
a
great
ba
beer
from
central
waters
glad
i
picked
up
a
few
extremely
cloudy
dark
brown
in
color
served
with
the
absolute
minimal
amount
of
head
that
reduces
to
virtually
nothing
light
lacing
aroma
is
full
on
caramel
with
notes
of
molasses
and
chocolate
syrup
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
with
more
caramel
chocolate
and
lots
of
vanilla
with
lesser
notes
of
oak
and
bourbon
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
smooth
but
finishes
awful
thin
an
interesting
beer
but
one
is
enough
metal
aging
a
weizenbock
for
six
months
in
heaven
hill
barrels
yeah
i
said
it
the
result
pours
a
bleak
dark
russet
topped
by
a
pair
o
fingers
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
bourbon
vanilla
sweet
caramel
light
oak
light
fig
and
light
roasted
malts
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
generally
speaking
with
whiskey
really
taking
the
upper
hand
and
squashing
the
majority
of
the
competition
as
things
progress
though
some
light
toasted
wheat
comes
through
along
with
molasses
and
a
good
helping
of
clove
but
dont
think
the
bourbons
gone
away
just
yet
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
yet
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
nice
if
a
bit
overthetop
barrelaged
wbock
rock
on
d
the
unique
flavor
combinations
found
in
the
base
beer
have
been
largely
overpowered
by
the
barrelaging
as
a
result
it
ends
up
tasting
like
a
nebulous
barrelaged
strong
ale
of
some
sort
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
but
doesnt
up
being
particularly
unique
or
distinct
either
good
stuff
all
around
here
paired
very
well
with
the
otterbeins
sugar
cookie
o
by
far
the
best
of
the
holiday
collection
i
might
even
buy
this
as
a
regular
release
it
is
quite
unique
for
a
hefeweizen
the
imperial
nature
of
it
gives
it
a
bit
of
sweetness
that
really
goes
well
with
the
yeasty
nature
of
it
overall
i
prefer
this
hefeweizen
to
all
the
others
i
have
currently
sampled
its
bigger
bolder
and
more
flavorful
than
the
traditional
hefeweizen
if
that
is
what
they
were
going
for
them
i
think
they
nailed
it
im
on
the
fence
with
this
beer
its
pretty
good
but
not
quite
sure
what
the
point
is
to
amp
up
the
alcohol
level
i
guess
its
like
a
hefeweizen
malt
liquor
for
an
analogy
worth
a
sampling
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
overall
a
subtler
take
but
with
very
noticeable
esters
that
really
make
a
mark
pretty
solid
and
enjoyable
afrer
pouring
500
ml
bottle
best
before

into
its
orginal
wiessbier
glass
i
can
say
that
it
has
dark
brown
colour
with
borwn
thick
head
it
smells
like
brown
bread
and
red
plump
when
you
taste
it
you
can
feel
caramel
flavours
despite
its
alc
7
3vol
it
can
not
be
feeled
in
the
finish
finally
i
definitely
say
that
i
like
this
typical
german
wheat
beer
ive
had
this
beer
a
month
ago
and
i
didnt
wrote
down
anything
at
all
but
for
what
i
can
recall
this
beer
was
aesthetically
beautiful
both
the
body
the
foam
and
the
carbonation
were
nice
yet
and
even
though
im
a
huge
fan
of
spicy
stuff
i
think
that
this
kind
of
spice
doesnt
go
well
at
all
with
any
kind
of
beer
the
best
thing
i
can
recall
from
that
night
was
that
i
couldnt
even
end
this
beer
because
of
how
strong
was
the
presence
of
the
spice
not
that
is
was
strong
but
only
that
the
it
was
too
much
quantity
for
the
given
amount
of
beer
yet
i
dont
find
it
a
bad
beer
but
ill
give
it
another
try
in
the
future
not
bad
for
my
first
weizenbock

im
going
to
be
controversial
and
not
suggest
a
german
dish
for
this
one
but
instead
suggest
beef

with
a
side
of
roasted
vegetables
and
rich
gravy
overall
being
that
this
bottle
was
quickly
coming
to
being
past
date
the
brew
inside
has
probably
fallen
off
significantly
already
aroma
was
approachable
but
taste
certainly
did
not
back
up
that
nice
front
would
certainly
be
open
to
revisiting
with
a
fresher
bottle
overall
not
quite
on
the
level
of
ayinger
or
weihenstephaners
weizenbock
but
its
not
far
off
quite
drinkable
though
the
flavor
leaves
a
smidgen
of
complexity
to
be
desired
to
summarize
its
a
good
beer
but
id
rather
pay
that
extra
50
cents
to
get
that
ayinger
or
weihenstephaner
weizenbock
and
before
that
id
likely
grab
the
dunkel
or
hefe

before
i
settled
with
the
weizenbocks
but
thats

o
i
was
very
surprised
at
this
beer
i
expected
a
typical
dunkel
which
is
not
my
favourite
style
of
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
smooth
and
tasty
this
beer
is
one
to
have
again

sure

o
erdinger
pikantus
has
a
great
doppelbock
malt
profile
that
from
the
beginning
to
end
carries
through
the
beer
nicely
balancing
dark
fruit
notes
with
soft
sweetness
but
what
the
beer
is
missing
is
a
fuller
yeast
profile
the
weizen
part
of
the
beer
is
good
but
too
nuanced
that
it
becomes
overshadowed
a
delectable
beer
regardless
overall
pretty
damn
good
especially
as
a
dessert
beer
as
the
flavor
could
be
a
bit
cloying
for
some
while
i
would
never
turn
one
down
i
feel
like
this
beer
has
its
time
and
place
and
is
more
of
a
specific
purpose
beer
than
the
competition
which
i
find
is
more
drinkable
at
any
occasion
this
is
a
pretty
average
weizenbock
not
my
favourite
the
smell
is
nothing
short
of
amazing
but
the
taste
is
a
little
disappointing
its
pretty
meh
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
its
on
the
thin
side
and
has
a
nice
robust
malty
palette
but
doesnt
have
any
oomph
its
sort
of
bland
i
cant
believe
im
saying
this
but
it
might
benefit
from
some
hops
if
it
had
some
dark
fruit
flavour
to
it
thatd
be
a
different
story
some
estery
alcohol
bite
would
be
nice
too
its
just
not
there
though
theres
really
not
much
going
on
i
would
never
buy
this
again
o
a
very
good
bock
what
i
used
to
think
of
as
the
perfect
octoberfest
beer
before
marzens
became
more
common
my
partgerman
dinner
guest
enjoyed
it
too
it
is
been
a
few
years
since
last
time
had
it
and
i
recall
to
like
it
a
lot
but
after
tasting
so
many
other
experiences
i
thought
it
might
be
boring
now
but
it
is
still
a
great
well
balanced
and
pleasant
brew
this
is
much
easier
to
drink
than
vitus
and
aventinus
so
a
good
start
point
or
a
more
relax
and
still
flavorful
weizenbock
pours
a
sexy
dark
brown
with
a
densely
bubbled
off
white
head
aroma
of
tea
like
hops
sarsaparilla
even
faint
cocoa
in
the
taste
roasted
malt
spicy

mineral
the
hard
water
of
the
erdinger
brewery
is
noticeable
faint
suggestions
of
chocolates
light
hop
character
that
is
balancing
and
earthy
with
a
small
spice
medium

and
quite

that
this

so
please

those

overall
a
wonderful
beer
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
and
slight
caramel
and
toast
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
slight
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
somewhat
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
flavors
are
somewhat
bland
in
my
opinion
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
its
good
i
would
totally
order
a
pitcher
of
this
if
i
was
in
germany
not
sure
when
i
will
be
in
germany
but
maybe
i
will
find
an
excuse
to
visit
the
brewery
i
guarantee
it
tastes
better
there
bottoms
up
people
on
par
with
other
offerings
from
erdinger
pikantus
is
a
very
agreeable
if
diminished
example
of
a
weizenbock
style
that
can
often
be
devastatingly
intense
and
spicy
if
youre
an
initiate
to
the
style
there
may
be
no
better
place
to
start
but
for
those
already
accustomed
to
the
likes
of
aventinus
vitus
and
ayinger
this
will
practically
be

poured
a
clear

with

and

consists
of

bread
with
some

and
some

taste
is
also
dominated
by
some

good

with
just
the
right
amount
of
residual
sugar
and
some
light
cloves

bready
notes
body
is
full
with
a
fluffy
creamy

and

solid

a
solid

mahogany

topped
with
a
massive

poor

also
presents
notes
of
vanilla

and
banana
tastes
much
the
same
as
it
smells
hearty
bread
with

and
spices
a
hint
of
raisin
banana

a
slight

with
medium

feels
smooth
and
slightly
thick
but
not
heavy
simple
but
flavourful
pleasant
and
approachable
not
a
great
weizenbock
but
still
a
good
one
o
a
tasty
weizenbock
with
a
decent
flavour
profile
nothing
overpowering
and
certainly
a
sessionable
version
of
the
style
these
guys
know
how
to
brew

yet
easy

brews
a
pleasant
addition
to
the

overall
this
is
a
decent
drink
however
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
more
bock
than
weizen
regardless
this
was
fairly
good
and
relatively
inexpensive
so
this
could
be
something
i
revisit
while
it
is
still
on
shelves
in
these
parts
overall
considering
some
of
the
great
reviews
i
have
heard
about
this
beer
i
am
certain
that
i
am
not
yet
used
to
this
style
but
it
tastes
to
me
like
a
thick
strong
wheat
beer
with
chocolate
and
caramel
syrup
poured
into
it
add
to
that
a
price
tag
of
au70
a
case
of
12
x
500ml
and
this
is
a
no
go
for
me
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
lots
of
great
flavours
that
work
really
well
together
the
carbonation
is
a
little
out
of
control
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
winner
for
me
although
erdinger
hefeweizen
is
easy
to
find
in
pennsylvania
for
some
reason
the
weizenbock
and
dunkelweizen
and
extremely
difficult
to
find
i
had
to
drive
deep
into
new
jersey
to
find
it
it
in
the
end
it
was
well
worth
the
trip
this
is
the
darkest
and
richest
weizenbock
i
have
tried
thus
far
aroma
of
caramelized
burnt
sugar
vanilla
and
over
ripe
bananas
sweet
dark
fruit
predominates
the
complex
taste
with
hints
of
dates
rum
raisins
maple
and
ripe
prunes
as
is
normal
for
erdinger
it
is
bottle
conditioned
and
very
cloudy
as
a
result
there
is
a
very
pleasant
lingering
aftertaste
of
pecan
pie
if
this
was
more
readily
available
i
would
certainly
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
standard
bock
nose
from
a
gorgeous
deep
cloudy
cocoa
brown
brew
with
a
pillowy
tan
head
looks
tasty
nothing
outrageous
or
different
in
the
flavor
profile
very
consistent
wheatmaltyeast
flavor
of
a
classic
dark
weizen
but
i
really
liked
that
the
additional
esters
and
malts
did
not
contribute
to
any
sweet
clingy
quality
as
advertised
the
malts
taste
sweet
but
dont
linger
or
leave
a
syrupy
feel
on
the
palate
nice
yeasty
wheat
finish
a
good
clean
solid
offering
if
you
enjoy
this
style
and
a
quaffable
summer
thirst
quencher
for
the
malt
enthusiast
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
large
tan
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
toffee
with
some
bubblegum
banana
and
clove
notes
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
very
similar
the
banana
and
bubblegum
notes
from
the
yeast
really
standing
out
there
is
also
some
caramel
and
toffee
from
the
malt
and
the
beer
is
fairly
sweet
overall
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
a
good
beer
but
there
are
definetly
better
weizenbocks
out
there
the
color
kind
of
scared
me
at
first
and
actually
made
me
question
weather
or
not
i
had
actually
picked
up
a
dunkleweizen
by
mistake
upon
further
inspection
of
the
bottle
just
now
i
noticed
they
have
actually
labeled
it
as
a
dunkler
weizenbock
odd
while
this
beer
is
decent
i
prefer
weinstephaners
vitus
over
this
any
day
o
a
rich
and
complex
weizenbock
very
enjoyable
od
quite
nice
really
rich
and
tasty
with
the
ease
of
a
regular
hefe
good
o
this
is
a
classically
good
german
weizenbock
love
it
cmon
importers
bring
us
more
good
german
bottles
this
is
not
quite
as
good
as
aventinus
in
fact
i
am
gonna
have
one
of
those
after
this
if
i
am
feeling
it
but
this
is
a
great
one
o
extremely
drinkable
decently
complex
somehow
warming
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
a
very
fine
brew
o
interesting
beer
nice
dark
fruit
flavor
almost
belgianesque
makes
me
question
whether
or
not
a
lot
of
the
weizenbocks
have
been
true
to
style
very
easy
drinking
beer
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
worth
consuming
another
one
of
erdingers
greatest
hits
i
will
have
this
again
however
their
actual
weissbier
is
still
number
one
to
me
d
this
is
a
good
beer
which
i
would
probably
drink
again
the
bitterness
definitely
lingers
for
a
while
it
feels
great
in
the
mouth
and
tastes
great
also
all
in
all
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
friends
try
it
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
wheat
notes
dark
fruit
and
a
small
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
wheat
a
small
citrus
and
notes
of
dark
fruits
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
wheat
and
banana
like
aftertaste
lots
of
fruitiness
going
on
a
small
alcohol
presence
but
nice
nonetheless
this
isnt
for
me
too
fruity
and
sweet
and
too
much
yeast
to
top
it
off
i
dont
know
the
style
well
to
compare
to
that
but
this
doing
it
for
me
there
is
still
a
lot
of
flavor
here
so
it
is
possible
if
sweeter
beers
are
your
thing
that
this
one
might
work
well
with
all
german
beers
it
is
possible
that
this
is
just
not
fresh
enough
httpabarwithnoname

com
o
a
nice
thick
beer
nice
flavors
and
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
quite
drinkable
even
though
its
fizzier
than
most
something
i
would
have
again
weizenbock
is
a
diverse
style
and
i
like
that
a
lot
something
i
think
many
bas
appreciate
very
much
is
variety
this
one
is
darker
but
not
too
sweet
with
a
rich
nose
i
would
like
to
see
even
more
weizenbocks
around
me
o
personally
im
not
a
big
fan
but
it
may
be
true
to
style
i
dont
know
it
well
this
is
some
good
stuff
delicious
complex
and
highly
drinkable
dr
hides
the
7

abv
extraordinarily
well
its
priced
very
fairly
2
quid
considering
german
standards
and
its
abv
as
well
a
great
beer
to
get
locked
on
if
youre
in
germany
id
certainly
have
this
one
again
any
beer
fanatic
should
try
this
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
both
warming
and
satisfying
i
really
love
this
great
pours
a
dark
brown
color
that
doesnt
let
too
much
light
through
the
initial
head
isnt
terribly
dense
and
fades
away
quickly
light
tan
and
no
lacing
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
as
some
booze
and
clove
a
bit
of
sweetness
there
as
well
the
flavor
has
a
modest
amount
of
chocolate
malt
as
well
as
some
mild
german
yeast
character
moderate
body
with
a
touch
o
booze
in
the
finish
pretty
good
but
nothing
too
memorable
overall
good
find
for
me
as
it
was
kind
of
difficult
to
get
a
hold
of
not
at
the
head
of
the
class
for
the
style
but
really
good
beverage
worth
trying
pretty
good
wheatbock
so
drinkable
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
is
barely
perceived
throughout
a
tasting
process
pours
a
hazy
medium
brown
with
offwhite
head
nose
is
aromatic
with
yeasty
bready
notes
reminding
me
of
dark
breads
palate
brings
forth
nice
dark
wheaty
flavors
wild
flavors
from
the
yeast
working
their
magic
and
plentyfor
carbonation
for
a
tingly
zing
as
it
goes
down
the
gullet
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
heavily
carbonated
on
the
palate
its
sweet
and
feels
nice
mild
bitterness
on
the
end
its
a
pretty
good
weizenbock
id
have
it
again
if
it
were
possible
on
a
side
note
this
beer
is
currently
on
the
top
50
list
for
germany
and
it
is
the
hardest
beer
to
track
down
it
was
worth
the
effort
unique
amongst
other
wheat
bocks
i
recommend
this
one
especially
if
youre
normally
not
a
fan
of
the
style
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
because
thats
all
i
have
at
this
time
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
coloring
with
brown
highlights
around
the
edges
no
head
present
but
a
slight
film
of
bubbling
the
beer
has
smells
of
caramel
but
light
due
to
increased
carbonation
also
present
are
smells
of
sweet
fruits
plums
and
raisins
and
malt
the
beer
has
an
initial
flavor
of
milk
chocolate
and
earthy
spices
the
flavor
is
quickly
followed
up
by
a
cherry
flavor
with
an
overcarbonated
feel
to
it
the
beer
is
sharp
and
overcarbonated
in
mouth
and
the
beer
does
not
have
enough
body
to
counterbalance
this
the
beer
has
a
semisweet
and
smooth
aftertaste
with
a
last
second
bite
of
the
carbonated
feel
the
finish
is
a
little
lackluster
with
an
overall
feel
of
sweet
letdown
not
a
beer
that
promotes
continued
drinking
in
my
opinion
an
extra
malty
weizenbock
that
is
very
enjoyable
as
a
winter
brew
i
really
like
this
ale
its
not
the
most
fullbodied
or
the
most
flavoursome
weizenbock
ive
had
but
its
a
very
tasty
brew
nonetheless
i
was
taken
aback
with
the
first
sip
had
a
hard
tart
bite
first
up
then
slowly
dissolving
into
the
more
predicatable
banana
clove
regime
the
aftertatste
was
a
little
tart
as
well
the
carbonation
being
over
the
top
and
all
over
i
like
my
wheat
beers
to
be
a
little
smooth
on
my
palate
i
really
like
their
dunkel
but
this
one
i
wouldnt
reach
out
for
definitely
no
patch
on
aventinus
or
vitus
d
not
my
favorite
weizenbock
but
it
was
cheap
and
one
i
hadnt
tried
before
reasonably
drinkable
though
pours
an
almost
dark
brown
body
with
a
quickly
dieing
twofinger
head
the
aroma
is
a
good
balance
of
bready
dry
malts
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
bitter
chocolate
and
some
earthy
hops
very
minor
peppery
spices
as
well
a
wellbalanced
chewey
medium
body
with
some
residual
sweetness
like
bitter
cocoa
and
caramel
with
hints
of
breadgrain
all
over
the
body
mixes
w
herbal
citric
hops
that
have
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
the
sharp
carbonation
in
this
beer
leads
to
some
sharpness
in
the
beer
including
a
sharp
pointed
finish
a
little
more
maltbock
based
than
hefe
but
still
wellbalanced
with
sweet
and
citric
spiciness
and
a
great
beer
to
relax
with
pours
a
very
dark
and
cloudy
deep
chestnut
color
with
s
light
tan
head
that
has
micro
bubbles
and
a
shaving
cream
like
consistency
really
pretty
red
highlights
in
the
beer
the
darkest
weizenbocks
i
have
had
so
far
the
aroma
has
a
tinge
of
banana
fosters
to
it
really
yeasty
and
shows
the
booze
too
much
for
me
citrus
spike
come
on
the
back
end
the
flavor
is
not
stylistically
what
i
was
looking
for
alcohol
esters
with
unfermented
sugary
malts
not
really
what
i
am
enjoying
the
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
and
its
got
good
carbonation
really
not
stylistically
in
the
realm
of
other
german
weizenbocks
overall
its
nothing
special
and
really
disappointed
me
i
have
been
impressed
with
erdinger
brews
but
not
this
one
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
and
would
purchase
this
again
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
too
much
carbonation
pikantus
doesnt
disappoint
its
not
the
best
of
the
style
aventinus
and
vitus
are
better
but
its
certainly
worthy
of
the
top
ten
drinkability
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
tends
to
become
more
oppressive
half
way
through
the
bottle
though
i
like
the
style
i
couldnt
finish
this
one
im
not
trying
to
trash
this
beer
as
many
seem
to
like
it
but
it
was
a
tad
bit
fizzy
for
my
tastes
d
as
far
as
ive
learned
a
weizenbock
is
a
hefe
brewed
to
bock
strength
this
example
takes
another
approach
and
seems
to
be
more
along
the
lines
of
a
doppel
brewed
with
wheat
and
a
fairly
neutral
weizen
yeast
both
unique
and
impressive
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
overall
the
alcohol
is
extremly
well
hidden
yielding
a
sweet
plumlike
brew
this
beer
unfourtunalty
comes
up
on
the
low
end
of
the
spectrum
for
me
on
the
weizenbock
scale
i
really
would
like
a
bit
more
spiciness
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
i
would
have
the
perfect
weizenbock
i
e
aveninus
or
vitus
it
looks
like
coca
cola
that
has
been
shaken
up
because
the
head
is
pretty
decent
head
disappears
kind
of
quickly
though
not
a
lot
of
yeast
sediment
there
is
a
vanilla
aroma
in
there
taste
is
like
a
regular
bock
only
a
little
sweeter
there
is
a
light
chocolate
note
along
with
roasted
malts
and
vanilla
mouth
is
heavy
but
very
good
smooth
finish
and
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
that
is
quite
pleasant
new
favorite
d
good
to
accompany
strong
meals
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
ive
tasted
pour
is
like
a
dopplebock
coca
cola
copper
with
a
big
head
that
fades
quickly
nose
is
a
little
chocolatey
some
raspberry
tea
as
buckeyenation
mentioned
but
very
mild
toasty
caramel
palate
is
a
bit
lost
as
to
what
the
difference
is
supposed
to
be
between
a
doppelbock
and
a
weizenbock
its
indistinguishable
no
wheat
character
not
fruit
from
the
wheat
malt
a
good
beer
as
a
doppelbock
but
not
creamy
crisp
and
hard
carbonation
like
like
a
doppelbock
some
dark
fruit
of
plum
and
black
currant
but
a
bit
lost
would
like
to
try
this
beside
there
doppelbock
and
see
what
the
actual
difference
is
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
because
of
the
all
natural
bottlefermentation
there
is
some
sediment
left
over
kinda
high
abv

reminds
me
of
a
very
good
home
brew
as
in
tast
but
as
for
a
germen
beer
a
little
different
for
me
a
very
good
beer
cant
wait
till
oktober
fest
to
try
out
of
draft
hopes
this
helps
people
wheat
and
yeast
are
more
evident
in
the
flavor
and
join
the
caramel
and
chocolate
from
the
nose
decent
lingering
finish
is
pleasant
and
not
too
sweet
with
a
slightly
spicy
and
nutty
close
as
the
beer
warms
becomes
a
bit
viscous
as
the
carbonation
settles
but
never
really
detracts
good
drinkability
as
the
sweetness
doesnt
overwhelm
and
the
body
and
flavor
keep
things
interesting

to
have
this
being
a

semmer
evening
will
try
again
this

then
i
fell
into
a
daze
and
moaned
for
several
hundred
pages
about
a

i
loved
d
very
drinkable
you
dont
realy
feel

alcohol

taste
leans
heavily
on
the
chocolate
maltiness
with
a
surprising
amount
of
sweet
cheap
5

double
bubble
gum
flavor
alcohol
is
easily
detectable
even
at
the
modest
level
of
7

all
the
flavors
come
together
well
and
this
is
a
fine
weizenbock
to
sip
or
gulp
a
pretty
modest
price
tag
as
i
got
it
for
less
than
four
bucks
aventinus
vitus
and
pikantus
all
are
very
different
interpretations
of
a
much
underrepresented
style
they
are
all
tasty
in
their
own
way
just
different
i
wish
there
were
more
of
these
around
i
will
definitely
buy
more
of
this
when
i
can
find
it
a
more
than
generous
carbonated
brew
that
sizzles
your
taste
buds
as
you
drink
i
feel
the
almost
over
carbonation
detracts
from
the
flavors
dry
in
the
finish
and
all
around
slightly
above
average
tasty
but
not
something
i
would
revisit
unless
i
was
visiting
the
brewery
in
germany
and
they
were
giving
them
out
for
free
overall
an
excellent
beer
this
is
my
first
weizenbock
and
i
have
to
say
i
have
had
a
very
very
good
first
impression
big
and
bubbly
is
the
head
and
the
bubbles
are
popping
and
slowly
going
with
it
is
the
head
good
autumn
amber
brown
color
with
hues
of
orange
the
aroma
is
sweet
very
malty
akin
to
a
marzen
sweet
doughy
bread
with
a
bit
of
yeast
some
maple
as
well
tastewise
it
has
quite
a
kick
of
flavor
a
little
monotone
and
tastes
more
like
a
marzen
plus
bubblegum
though
its
still
a
good
flavor
could
be
better
overall
though
the
carbonation
bubbles
are
too
big
and
pretty
intense
not
good
for
a
strong
beer
and
it
holds
back
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
still
this
is
pretty
good
and
less
expensive
than
aventinus
for
the
budget
conscious
poured
into
my
squatters
true
pint
glass
a
very
nice
dark

very
nice

a
very
nice

of
sticky

notes
medium
body
the
abv
is
hidden
very
well
with
this
brew
very
easy
going
down
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
one
d
easily
the
best
of
the
three
erdinger
beers
ive
had
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
the
nose
warming
helps
things
along
but
this
beer
doesnt
quite
match
up
with
the
best
of
its
style
overall
however
im
quite
glad
i
picked
it
up
overall
a
nice
looking
and
smelling
beer
but
nothing
id
venture
out
for
again
i
lacks
a
bit
taste
wise
overall
i
love
this
bier
much
like
the
aventinus
but
not
quite
as
good
this
is
one
enjoyable
bier
that
will
not
disappoint
prosit
md
the
carbonation
comes
slightly
too
sharp
upfront
but
this
is
not
a
hurdle
to
the
enjoyment
as
the
body
remains
intact
and
moderate
while
the
flavour
is
wellintegrated
and
charmingly
light
for
a
weizenbock
this
is
apparently
on
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
from
the
famous
aventinus
from
schneider
sohn
that
this
is
way
less
estery
in
flavour
but
shows
a
really
decent
profound
malt
composition
overall
a
truly
highly
drinkable
weizenbock
in
my
book
esp
given
that
almost
no
trace
of
alc
is
found
throughout
the
drink
i
found
this
a
pleasant
if
not
perfect
brew
that
is
well
crafted
and
will
be
in
my
fridge
again
not
bad
full
of
flavor
and
under
8
as
well
its
an
imperfect
marriage
of
a
bock
and
a
hefeweizen
but
otherwise
its
still
quite
delicious
pick
it
up
dark
scarlet
and
turbid
with
tons
of
suspended
yeast
and
a
massive
foamy
sand
colored
head
that
leaves
very
little
lace
behind
smells
of
dark
fruit
raisins
dates
prunes
etc
some
spicy
yeast
and
clove
are
present
tastes
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
dark
fruity
sweetness
balanced
by
a
dry
yeasty
quality
and
just
enough
hop
bittering
and
warm
alcohol
in
the
finish
high
carbonation
adds
to
the
drinkability
good
stuff
this
beer
is
growing
on
me
ill
have
to
pick
up
a
few
more
its
still
a
very
rough
style
though
there
arent
a
ton
of
easily
available
weizenbocks
but
aventinus
and
the
relatively
new
vitus
cast
a
long
shoadow
over
the
style
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
slightly
reddish
with
a
dissipating
beige
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
nose
is
fruity
with
dark
stone
fruit
combined
with
ripe
bananas
the
flavor
is
actually
quite
complex
but
it
isnt
bright
enough
for
me
as
a
weizenbock
the
feel
starts
almost
excessively
fizzy
my
girlfriend
called
it
sodalike
but
the
feel
is
more
on
the
expensive
small
batch
end
of
soda
the
taste
just
doesnt
have
the
rich
spiced
fruit
flavors
of
the
best
weizenbocks
but
its
still
a
good
beer
overall
not
bad
at
all
but
not
quite
a
memorable
one
enjoyable
and
drinkable
enough
this
was
not
as
good
as
their
dunkel
but
much
better
than
their
helles
id
definately
have
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
like
i
would
the
dunkel
i
hope
to
review
this
beer
again
once
ive
cellared
a
bottle
or
two
for
a
while
500ml
bottle
hazy
brown
with
a
huge
tight
bubbled
light
tan
head
sweetish
aromas
of
malt
and
a
strained
wheatinesspretty
subdued
though
while
indeed
sweet
it
has
a
rather
intresting
undertone
that
is
semibitter
from
the
malts
presumably
and
this
tempers
the
sweet
wheat
like
ceral
at
the
end
of
the
taste
creamy
aspects
even
little
alcohol
present
but
its
nice
liked
the
palate
on
this
smoothvelvet
and
creamy
at
the
end
nice
beer
much
betterthan
the
other
erdinger
wheat
beers
i
had
had
if
this
was
casked
conditioned
for
a
firkin
fest
i
think
this
would
be
amongst
the
first
to
empty
for
a
weizen
bock
this
is
good
ive
had
better
on
tap
and
in
growlers
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
maybe
a
touch
too
sweet
to
drink
a
lot
of
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
every
so
often
but
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
it
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
from
this
one
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
really
enjoyed
the
fruity
complexity
of
the
taste
strongly
recommend
trying
this
one
edit
alright
it
improved
as
it
warmed
so
im
bumping
the
smell
and
taste
scores
the
balance
between
alcohol
and
flavour
is
pretty
good
not
normally
a
fan
of
this
style
but
i
dont
mind
this
one
finish
is
slightly
bitter
but
fairly
balanced
brown
pour
with
a
full
tan
head
caramel
and
sugar
aroma
mixed
with
yeast
nuts
and
oats
wheat
nuts
and
brown
sugar
in
the
flavor
some
metal
and
alcohol
lots
of
driedlod
dark
fruits
prunes
figs
dates
blended
with
caramel
almost
candied
good
enough
mouth
strong
with
good
body
malty
flavor
with
some
hints
of
coffee
and
cacao
mmm
serving
500
ml
bottle
on
the
palate
this
is
a
nice
big
balanced
weizenbock
with
a
rich
body
and
full
flavors
and
its
just
as
heavy
on
the
head
leaving
it
in
the
onetotwo
beer
company
with
much
more
than
that
going
overboard
overall
a
delicious
sipper
and
one
that
becomes
much
more
balanced
palatable
complex
and
even
stronger
as
it
warms
d
this
is
a
nice
slow
sipper
the
flavor
and
presentation
make
me
want
to
try
it
again
im
even
tempted
to
update
my
favorite
style
its
ok
though
the
carbonation
makes
it
less
enjoyable
the
flavors
are
rather
nice
though
subtle
will
probably
stick
with
vitus
and
aventinus
as
my
favs
overall
good
for
the
style
and
good
for
anything
the
vitus
is
something
i
enjoy
more
but
im
still
trying
more
of
these
types
for
what
its
worth
this
is
the
best
erdinger
ive
had
personally
i
thought
their
hefe
was
decent
and
their
kristal
wasnt
bad
but
was
nothing
in
comparison
to
the
weihenstephaners
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
into
my
oklahoma
university
hefe
glass
a
huge
chunky
tan
head
fades
slowly
smells
of
clove
malt
banana
lemon
and
orange
tastes
of
spice
malts
subtle
chocolate
grain
and
an
underlying
sweetness
fairly
well
carbonated
with
streaks
of
bubbles
floating
to
the
top
through
the
life
of
the
beer
light
to
medium
bodied
and
not
that
creamy
but
smooth
going
down
nonetheless
the
7
3
abv
was
not
realy
noticeable
until
i
noticed
it
on
the
bottle
and
started
paying
attention
basically
its
evident
but
not
too
much
the
perfect
weizenbock
for
a
late
summer
day
dark
brown
with
a
large
frothy
head
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
but
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
rich
and
bold
with
dark
ripe
fruits
brown
sugar
molasses
and
a
hint
of
toffee
taste
follow
but
with
raisin
and
plum
leading
to
a
sweet
round
middle
flavor
and
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
from
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
wheat
mouth
is
reasonably
viscous
with
healthy
carbonation
tickling
the
tongue
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
very
drinkable
and
highly
recommended
d
not
a
terrible
beer
but
a
little
off
balance
some
of
the
harshest
and
least
desirable
aspects
are
accentuated
while
the
softer
flavors
are
restrained
d
smells
better
than
it
tastes
but
probably
is
a
good
beer
for
the
style
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
scent
and
taste
of
this
beer
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
the
more
i
contemplate
it
and
study
its
characteristics
the
more
i
appreciate
it
not
the
best
for
its
style
buts
its
near
the
top
a
great
choice
for
someone
desiring
the
style
with
a
dark
fruit
slant
halfliter
german
bottle
conditioned
with
122007
on
the
back
label
the
beer
is
a
yeastladen
mahogany
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
four
fingers
of
loose
tan
head
that
snaps
crackles
and
pops
eventually
reducing
to
nothing
and
imparting
no
lace
sweet
vinous
and
grapeycidery
in
the
nose
with
mild
banana
some
grassiness
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
old
and
not
to
style
but
not
that
bad
similar
on
the
palate
with
touches
of
wheat
and
dark
malts
some
esters
and
just
a
hint
of
oxidation
the
light
and
tingly
body
thickens
slowly
and
has
very
little
finish
definitely
not
a
typical
weizenbock
but
it
doesnt
taste
that
bad
considering
its
past
the
freshness
date
and
lightly
oxidized
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
since
most
of
the
flavor
is
lifted
away
and
leaves
a
slight
acidic
aftertaste
i
gave
the
beer
four
for
drinkability
because
its
still
a
pleasant
dark
germanstyle
wheat
beer
the
other
characteristics
i
gave
pikantus
a
lower
rating
on
because
according
to
the
other
beers
of
this
style
that
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
should
be
a
fruitier
chewier
experience
and
i
didnt
get
what
i
was
hoping
for
not
horrible
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
returning
overall
best
erdinger
in
my
opinion
great
combination
of
wheat
yeast
and
dark
roasted
malts
it
may
be
too
sweet
for
some
drinkers
but
overall
great
beer
looking
forward
for
another
one
recommended
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
massive
billowy
and
recedes
slowly
into
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
toffee
wheat
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
hint
of
tangy
wheat
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
suppose
i
could
drink
again
almost
fruity
malty
rich
wheaty
nose
some
alcohol
aroma
present
too
as
it
warms
up
dark
caramel
chocolate
color
with
looong
lasting
foamy
off
white
head
taste
was
malty
and
bock
like
with
a
definite
taste
of
wheatiness
as
well
an
interesting
beer
of
a
style
id
like
to
try
more
of
towards
the
end
i
could
taste
the
alcohol
some
as
well
but
overall
a
good
beer
that
id
get
again
occasionally
a
bland
version
of
what
usually
is
an
exciting
style
dumbed
down
with
yeast
and
carbonation
this
bocks
true
flavors
never
have
the
chance
to
shine
i
think
this
would
be
good
one
to
pair
with
gamey
dishes
such
as
duck
my
first
of
this
style
and
i
like
it
alot
see
you
try
something
new
and
you
get
rewarded
this
is
my
first
ever
weizenbock
style
beer
i
bought
the
bottle
from
my
dutch
beer
friend
along
with
a
whole
lot
of
other
goodies
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
huge
head
that
tops
the
dark
brown
beer
beneath
the
head
quickly
dissipates
leaving
a
thin
layer
of
foam
with
some
lacing
the
smell
was
bock
malty
nice
huge
malts
as
expected
for
a
weizenbock
some
earthy
tones
and
it
almost
smelled
a
little
salty
the
entry
to
the
taste
was
fairly
alcoholic
and
a
little
bitter
with
the
malts
hiding
beneath
these
malts
then
start
showing
up
more
and
get
stronger
towards
the
finish
clearly
i
could
pick
up
some
spices
including
cloves
and
the
familiar
banana
notes
evident
in
many
german
wheat
beers
however
the
taste
was
not
embracing
what
i
was
expecting
after
getting
a
really
good
nose
in
particular
the
alcoholic
and
bitter
part
of
it
was
something
i
prefer
without
the
after
taste
had
some
alcoholic
notes
in
it
with
some
dark
fruits
dates
and
a
nice
slightly
sweet
bready
maltiness
which
was
there
to
last
the
mouthfeel
was
between
medium
to
full
body
with
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
and
smoothness
was
there
just
as
like
any
of
the
erdingers
i
had
the
disappointment
was
in
the
taste
entry
it
was
pretty
strong
though
only
going
at
7
3
abv
at
times
i
was
kind
of
drinking
it
like
drinking
a
weizen
i
have
one
more
bottle
of
this
hope
it
would
give
me
a
better
experience
as
i
do
have
really
high
expectations
of
this
style
being
a
big
fan
of
bocks
and
hefeweizens
d
a
good
beer
for
sure
but
due
to
the
7
3abv
it
surely
wouldnt
be
something
youd
session
d
its
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better

comment
im
falling
more
and
more
for
weizenbocks
perhaps
its
my
germanic
dna
coming
to
the
front
and
demanding
a
brew
from
the
home
land
of
my
ancestors
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
smells
sweet
and
sugar
cane
like
with
a
burnt
background
tastes
a
lot
more
bland
than
it
smells
it
has
a
good
base
of
dark
roasted
malts
to
it
but
lacks
the
complexity
of
some
of
its
peers
it
does
have
some
ester
quality
but
overall
it
comes
out
washed
out
has
a
fine
mouthfeel
ive
liked
this
style
in
the
past
this
one
just
seems
a
little
weak
for
what
ive
been
hoping
for
a
very
clean
beer
but
a
bit
bland
lacks
the
hefeweizen
yeast
character
and
really
lookstastes
something
like
a
bland
doppelbock
i
guess
my
review
is
a
bit
of
an
outlier
here
beyond
the
first
standard
deviation
and
almost
outside
the
second
but
i
love
malt
i
love
weizenbier
and
i
love
bocks
this
baby
is
a
very
good
example
of
all
that
i
love
in
beer
highly
recommended
d
a
very
pleasing
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
all
the
flavors
blend
marvelously
leaving
only
a
hint
of
the
abv
and
a
slight
fading
bitterness
at
the
end
i
cant
particularly
distinguish
the
hops
from
the
other
flavors
very
easily
drinkable
though
fullbodied
enough
to
serve
as
its
own
meal
the
carbonation
is
just
a
hair
too
sharp
but
the
nice
and
creamy
head
balances
it
enough
to
not
be
offensive
overall
a
very
enjoyable
experience
500
ml
bottle
color
of
dark
caramel
with
a
brown
thick
frothy
head
nose
of
yeast
malts
watery
and
some
cartelization

taste
of
malts
oats
yeast
and
sugar
sweet
body
is
watery
but
full
smooth
and
with
low
to
medium
carbonation

aftertaste
of
malts
almost
too
sweet
and
light

easy
drinking
i
noticed
after
i
drank
the
bottle
that
the
bestby
date
was
march
2006
so
16
months
after
that
date
it
was
still
a
pretty
good
beer
i
prefer
a
little
more
sweetness
and
banana
flavor
in
weizenbocks
but
this
was
still
an
interesting
beer
prost
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
head
that
took
a
while
to
subside
aroma
was
malty
and
yeasty
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
taste
was
malty
and
caramelly
with
a
good
bit
of
sweet
fruity
flavors
mixed
in
i
could
just
barely
taste
the
clovey
banana
flavors
that
the
style
is
known
for
i
was
sort
of
disappointed
in
that
i
was
looking
forward
to
the
beer
having
a
lot
more
of
that
spicy
characteristic
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
in
the
palate
drinkability
was
pretty
good
and
the
beer
went
down
fairly
easy
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
not
anywhere
close
to
aventinus
in
complexity
mouthfeel
is
just
a
tad
on
the
fizzy
side
less
natural
carbonation
would
not
hurt
at
all
here
overall
drinkability
along
with
a
healthy
plus
abv
make
this
brew
a
pleasure
to
consume
well
done
sharply
tart
metallic
first
wave
heavily
carbonation
roasted
chocolate
fruity
floral
herbal
european
hops
light
warmth
and
spice
sticky
thick
sweetness
in
back
finishes
mostly
clean
with
lingering
yeast
flavors
recommended
not
a
perfect
weizenbock
and
too
bad
i
love
the
style
but
a
good
one
great
stuff
dessert
beer
a
good
complex
weizenbock
the
chocolate
hints
give
it
a
delicious
flavor
watch
out
for
the
alcohol
though
d
a
relatively
straightforward
weizenbock
thats
easy
to
drink
would
be
happy
to
have
another
subsequent
sips
provide
a
bit
more
cohesive
smoothed
out
flavor
profile
which
i
can
surely
appreciate
despite
it
not
being
my
thing
beyond
the
tang
i
am
hard
pressed
to
pick
up
additional
nuances
save
a
bit
of
toffee
and
maybe
the
faintest
air
of
charred
banana
peel
still
not
the
banclv
bomb
that
i
was
hoping
for
recommended
for
variety
and
i
will
probably
never
drink
one
again
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
will
be
drinking
it
more
in
the
future
im
surprised
that
i
didnt
recall
it
being
so
good
from
past
drinkings
poured
beer
from
bottle
into
tumbler
at
45
degrees
beer
nice
brown
dark
look
with
a
fat
pillowy
tan
brown
head
very
lumpy
with
lots
of
sticky
lacing
rather
nuetral
smelling
beer
maybe
a
little
nutty
sweet
taste
was
same
kinda
nutty
sweet
slightly
but
not
overpowering
with
nice
malty
finish
alcohol
right
tight
but
right
on
verge
of
being
too
much
i
believe
i
will
try
this
beer
again
though
mouthfeeldrinkability
moutfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
nice
creamy
feel
to
it
and
has
a
really
good
drinkability
well
done
a
great
beer
and
a
fabulous
example
of
a
weizenbock
drinkabilityoverall
not
the
most
complex
weizenbock
ive
ever
had
but
certainly
the
most
drinkable
goes
well
with
prenoon
college
football
saturday
drinking
on
a
chilly
madison
morning
overall
a
very
good
example
of
a
weizenbock
not
quite
up
there
with
the
likes
of
aventinus
but
definitely
worth
a
try
a
pity
its
not
as
readily
available
as
the
other
erdinger
beers
nothing
really
changed
or
improved
over
time
i
guess
germany
isnt
really
known
for
wowing
people
with
flavor
complexity
but
im
spoiled
after
aventinus
this
beer
is
about
as
unexciting
on
the
inside
as
is
the
packaging
so
i
guess
it
met
my
expectations
d
no
real
developments
after
2
years
perhaps
appearance
has
suffered
and
carbonation
settled
which
is
good
overall
still
a
tasty
chocolatey
malt
forward
weizenbock
found
this
pretty
drinkable
couldnt
do
it
all
night
but
pretty
damn
tasty
thick
coating
mouthfeel
and
all
that
this
beer
is
really
good
i
highly
recommend
it
but
aventinus
is
even
better
has
a
mild
sweetness
with
some
nutty
quality
to
it
coupled
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
that
mask
the
alcohol
nicely
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
though
there
is
nothing
here
that
wows
me
pours
a
very
exuberant
beige
head
even
after
a
sensitive
pour
the
head
was
as
big
as
my
fist
left
a
thick
foam
for
about
twofifths
of
the
beer
color
is
a
bubbly
chocolate
syrup
with
mahagony
and
ruby
highlights
smell
was
a
mix
off
deeply
romantic
malts
and
hints
of
roasted
wheat
taste
was
like
a
more
bubbly
american
porter
without
the
american
hop
presence
of
course
germans
know
how
to
manipulate
their
malts
lovely
the
palate
was
just
a
little
metallic
at
the
finish
the
brew
has
a
medium
body
with
a
slightly
astringent
sharp
presence
on
the
palate
taste
is
slightly
citric
with
a
backing
of
earthy
malt
with
showings
of
caramel
pretty
smooth
and
quenching
perceived
alcohol
is
subdued
making
this
a
drinkable
beer
worth
taking
a
look
at
perhaps
what
i
liked
most
about
the
this
is
that
upon
first
drinking
it
seems
commonin
each
individual
aspect
but
as
you
progress
further
you
realize
the
complexity
the
sweet
start
refreshing
middle
spicydry
carbonated
end
it
doesnt
pack
the
depth
body
or
flavour
uniqueness
of
aventinus
but
it
makes
up
a
lot
with
drinkability
enjoyable
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
styles
worth
checking
out
comments
this
was
not
my
favorite
enjoyable
interesting
but
not
in
league
with
others
in
the
style
such
as
aventinus
this
is
a
lot
heavier
than
expected
which
detracted
from
my
enjoyment
too
sweet
this
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
you
could
almost
think
of
this
as
a
heavy
stout
with
an
attitude
on
steroids
damned
good
stuff
very
dark
ruby
red
and
brownish
in
color
caramel
plum
burnt
sugar
came
through
in
the
nose
taste
was
much
of
the
same
but
more
noticeable
hints
of
banana
and
clove
hidden
in
there
as
well
high
carbonation
with
a
full
body
to
back
it
up
not
available
near
me
but
a
solid
choice
when
i
have
the
chance
drinkability
pretty
easy
notes
what
a
night
two
german
brews
in
a
row
that
are
exceptional
deep
rich
complex
fruity
yeasty
some
roasted
grains
keep
it
in
check
great
certainly
this
is
not
the
best
weizenbock
this
is
a
rich
sumptuous
bock
it
pours
prunedark
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
throughout
drinking
the
aroma
is
composed
of
caramel
prunesraisins
and
a
touch
of
baking
spices
on
the
palate
the
cloves
come
out
along
with
sweet
prunes
and
other
spices
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
what
youd
expect
from
a
bock
with
very
little
raw
alcohol
present
quite
a
nice
bock
here
pretty
darn
drinkable
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
in
fact
it
is
reminding
me
that
i
really
like
weizen
bocks
too
bad
there
are
not
more
of
these
around
because
i
really
like
how
the
rich
malt
character
pairs
with
the
traditional
hefeweizen
yeast
this
is
definitely
a
style
that
i
need
to
brew
as
well
i
sense
a
recipe
coming
on
for
next
winter
the
rich
flavors
pair
quite
well
with
the
chewy
texture
and
sweet
malt
notes
this
is
my
type
of
liquid
bread
wow
sure
its
7
percent
alcohol
it
hides
well
in
such
a
finess
beer
has
a
strong
bready
almost
toasty
flavor
and
creamy
rich
body
shares
with
estery
fruity
flavors
llight
tartness
and
citrus
blends
with
dense
wheat
malts
lots
of
protein
and
dense
head
retention
a
medium
brown
with
lots
of
rust
colors
may
be
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
bready
yeasty
malty
side
to
enjoy
often
but
a
good
mixerupper
good
for
a
hot
summer
night
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
its
very
different
from
aventinus
weizenbock
this
is
an
underrated
style
and
i
really
look
forward
to
gettting
more
of
this
and
more
of
the
style
havent
had
too
many
weizenbocks
so
i
decided
that
this
would
be
a
good
choice
poured
into
a
pint
glass
an
almost
eggplant
looking
color
that
was
lighter
and
cloudier
at
the
top
head
was
minimal
but
still
left
a
nice
lace
with
smell
i
wasnt
too
impressed
it
was
very
musty
with
a
powdery
medicinal
aroma
taste
was
an
improvement
lots
of
hops
powder
spice
banana
basically
alot
of
complexities
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
heavy
but
still
very
easy
to
drink
in
fact
i
would
like
to
try
some
more
and
see
what
i
pick
up
on
upon
sampling
the
second
time
the
only
other
weizenbock
that
ive
had
is
victory
moonglow
having
said
that
i
have
top
say
that
i
like
the
style
quite
a
bit
very
different
and
interesting
dont
pass
this
one
up
if
you
see
it
maybe
not
the
majestic
beer
i
remember
but
given
my
fondness
for
the
belgians
and
not
the
german
brews
i
think
it
was
pretty
damn
fantastic
this
is
good
but
it
doesnt
compare
to
aventinus
or
victory
moonglow
imho
a
very
nice
typical
german
beer
musings
too
much
stuff
going
on
for
me
here
every
now
and
then
you
get
brilliance
in
a
sip
but
no
consistent
behaviour
strong
and
weird
trying
this
stuff
is
worth
it
going
back
is
another
1
pint
9
ounce
bottle
erdinger
pinkatus
pours
out
a
thick
dark
brown
color
with
a
large
rocky
head
the
aroma
is
chocolate
and
bananas
but
i
also
pick
up
something
not
unlike
blood
banana
bread
and
vanilla
flavor
sweet
and
malty
this
beer
is
missing
the
sour
flavor
that
i
associate
with
the
style
some
tasty
spices
flowery
hops
come
in
at
the
finish
thick
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
quite
the
weizenbock
a
nice
appearance
and
the
flavor
to
back
it
up
opinion
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
this
particular
weizenbock
is
a
lot
cleaner
than
aventinus
which
can
be
taken
either
way
i
really
like
the
fruitiness
you
get
in
aventinus
but
it
is
a
lot
like
their
traditional
weizen
beers
with
the
banana
and
the
rest
of
the
fruit
basket
this
beer
is
more
malt
accentuated
with
a
wheaty
grainy
edge
it
goes
down
really
smooth
and
almost
dangerously
hides
the
7
3abv
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
from
the
bottle
poured
mahogany
big
light
tan
head
that
left
some
lacing
aroma
toffee
malty
alcohol
citrus
leanig
towards
grapefruit
and
orange
flavor
sour
raisins
molasses
cola
plums
citrus
more
on
the
orange
side
alcohol
not
to
bad
i
might
buy
again
d
the
pinkatus
is
a
soid
weizenbock
with
good
scent
and
taste
though
nothing
terribly
outstanding
the
beers
attributes
improve
slightly
as
it
warms
making
the
overall
experience
more
enjoyable
quite
filling
as
a
beer
and
worth
trying
if
you
enjoy
the
style
poured
a
deep
rich
brown
with
a
fluffy
offat
settles
into
a
cramy
topa
sweeter
aroma
that
of
caramel
and
sweet
alcohol
with
a
hint
of
phenolic
spice
flavors
are
pretty
basic
pretty
sweet
with
some
weizen
banana
and
clove
traits
but
it
really
doesnt
jump
out
at
ya
an
alcohol
kick
goes
down
with
the
finish
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
lends
to
its
drinkability
it
went
down
quite
easy
for
7
3
alc
a
solid
but
basic
brew
one
i
would
buy
again
body
medium
to
big
slick
chewy
and
creamy
big
bubbles
give
it
a
fizzy
mouthfeel
good
and
very
different
than
aventinus
which
is
pretty
much
the
standard
that
all
others
are
weighed
against
pikantus
was
on
my
mind
all
day
at
work
always
been
fond
of
erdingers
offerings
this
one
would
be
great
with
dessert
i
want
to
wash
down
a
slice
of
pecan
pie
with
this
tone
down
the
carbonation
a
notch
malt
is
sweet
but
roasted
so
while
there
is
a
lot
of
it
it
doesnt
overpower
all
in
all
this
bock
has
got
all
the
pieces
malty
fruity
with
sweetness
and
drinkable
to
the
end
beers
like
this
one
are
why
i
love
weizenbocks
its
beautiful
its
warm
its
drinkable
and
its
delicious
i
will
definitely
a
style
i
will
explore
in
the
future
a
great
refreshing
session
beer
a
cloudy
dark
brown
beer
has
a
big
foamy
light
brown
head
there
is
a
light
biscuity
malt
note
in
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
background
a
lot
of
things
going
on
in
the
flavor
some
fig
dried
fruit
some
clove
and
in
the
finish
there
is
a
nice
hint
of
milk
chocolate
easy
to
drink
and
swift
to
the
palate
a
tad
underwhelming
for
the
style
but
plenty
good
and
satisfying
enough
to
recommend
a
try
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
diminshes
to
a
thin
partial
surface
covering
aroma
of
candied
raisins
chocolate
and
roasted
grain
medium
to
thinnish
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
around
the
edges
with
ample
carbonation
odd
actually
strong
fruitiness
is
most
noticable
wheat
malt
lies
behind
it
with
a
sort
of
raisiny
flavor
in
the
background
alcoholic
vapors
in
the
finish
this
is
a
pretty
hearty
weizenbock
despite
that
its
very
easy
drinking
this
ones
a
thick
impenetrable
ruddy
brown
colored
liquid
its
a
creamy
and
full
bodied
brew
with
moderate
carbonation
the
flavor
is
notably
roasted
with
an
almost
syrupy
sweetness
up
front
the
aroma
has
a
muted
malt
characteristic
with
a
lot
of
fruit
prune
banana
alcohol
is
also
detectable
in
the
aroma
the
finish
has
a
pleasing
spiciness
its
a
very
nicelooking
beerwith
a
solid
stable
billowing
head
this
is
an
extremely
satisfying
beer
great
mouthfeel
with
a
touch
of
lightness
from
the
carbonation
hard
to
fault
it
drinkability
though
suffers
from
how
substantial
this
brew
is
very
enjoyable
but
tough
to
return
for
another
smooth
slight
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
very
enjoyable
drinkability
is
very
high
my
notes
read
oh
hell
yes
glad
to
find
this
one
it
aint
aventinus
but
its
good
from
bottle
had
trouble
controlling
the
pour
resulting
in
a
massive
rocky
light
tan
head
which
lasted
well
too
well
had
to
wait
a
while
to
finish
the
pour
when
the
head
finally
settled
down
colour
was
dense
tan
not
much
light
getting
through
brown
sugarmolassis
aroma
dominated
this
carried
through
to
the
taste
with
some
coffee
tones
finish
was
a
little
metalic
with
the
alcohol
well
hidden
mouth
feel
was
a
little
on
the
watery
side
not
up
to
the
aventinus
but
not
bad
either
pours
a
deep
dark
copper
color
with
a
magnificent
meringuelike
head
smells
of
caramel
bananas
raisins
and
sweet
malty
yeast
taste
is
comparable
to
smell
first
flavor
is
that
of
caramel
with
dark
fruits
coming
in
right
after
a
very
slight
alcohol
taste
towards
the
end
with
a
malty
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
very
effervescent
naturally
and
medium
body
as
weizenbocks
go
this
is
a
very
good
albeit
very
sweet
brew

mouthfeel
theres
a
very
good
beer
hidden
in
here
somewhere
but
it
remains
unreleased
sweetness
is
mostly
to
blame
very
drinkable
pours
a
hazy
dark
chestnut
body
that
is
opaque
until
held
to
some
light
creamy
beige
head
is
about
two
fingers
tall
and
retains
well
leaving
some
sheet
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
somewhat
restrained
with
some
initial
lemony
citrus
and
grassy
notes
ripe
banana
becomes
dominant
after
the
final
pour
with
the
yeast
swirled
in
some
clove
and
white
pepper
are
also
noted
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied

taste
is
much
better
near

temperature
with
the

swirled
in
pleasantly
drinkable
and

constructed

well
with

an

pours
a
hazed
chestnut
color
with
some
deep
orange
highlights
volumnous
tan
head
thats
fizzing
and
popping
like
a
bowl
of
rice
krispies
some
flaky
particules
in
suspension
roasted
wheat
malt
twang
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
and
faint
ripe
banana
notes
in
the
nose
but
rather
tame
malty
and
rich
with
the
right
amount
of
wheaty
acidity
nearer
the
finish
to
keep
it
drinkable
lively
carbonation
tickles
the
palate
and
keep
any
sense
of
sweetness
at
bay
it
is
pretty
tasty
and
smooth
but
a
little
onedimensional
in
the
sense
that
it
is
lacking
in
some
of
those
complex
tropical
esters
that
i
feel
constitute
a
great
weizenbock
ontap
poured
into
a
small
erdinger
weizen
glass
it
pours
a
deep
murky
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
there
is
little
lacing
the
smell
has
bits
of
dark
fruit
and
caramel
maltiness
just
a
little
light
though
the
taste
is
sweet
and
has
a
lot
of
caramel
to
it
hints
of
toffee
and
raisin
in
there
as
well
the
body
is
fairly
nice
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
great
for
a
7
3
brew
a
decent
weizenbock
this
is
my
first
taste
of
this
beer
and
initally
it
is
very
impressive
it
has
a
nice
smooth
malt
taste
that
hangs
around
a
little
while
i
agree
with
kpitz
on
the
body
which
seems
a
little
lite
needs
to
be
a
bit
thicker
but
i
liked
the
head
and
the
way
it
settled
as
i
took
time
to
drink
this
beer
also
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
with
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
i
think
i
have
found
another
style
to
enjoy
in
my
beer
adventures
with
this
one
being
a
very
enjoyable
libation
this
was
a
pretty
good
weizenbock
some
flaws
are
the
alcohol
flavor
which
was
a
bit
stronger
than
i
would
expect
and
the
veggie
offflavor
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
so
if
you
see
a
single
of
it
pick
it
up
sometime
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
nice
smell
of
banana
and
some
other
fruits
as
well
as
a
hint
of
dark
malt
the
flavor
is
caramel
with
banana
and
a
dark
fruit
pretty
nice
drinkability
is
good
and
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
could
use
a
little
more
body
but
overall
a
good
beer
well
see
last
time
i
had
it
i
dont
think
i
liked
it
the
beer
pours
a
flat
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
a
finger
in
height
the
nose
is
a
slight
dark
fruit
and
caramel
covered
banana
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
not
that
bad
there
is
a
bit
of
creamyness
and
a
hint
of
banana
and
raisin
and
caramel
sweetness
i
guess
i
stand
corrected
on
this
beer
the
feel
is
slightly
thin
for
the
flavor
i
would
like
it
to
be
more
creamy
and
just
a
slight
bit
thicker
but
its
not
bad
at
all
this
is
a
nice
beer
easy
drinking
and
smooth
good
show
pours
a
very
dark
brownish
black
color
and
has
a
off
white
head
that
is
3
fingers
thick
and
stable
there
is
an
odd
mix
of
alcohol
and
raisins
and
cloves
an
odd
mix
but
not
bad
it
is
a
frankenstein
of
a
beer
and
it
definitely
pushes
its
weight
around
in
the
flavor
department
it
has
a
definite
bock
character
that
follows
up
with
a
crisp
clean
wheat
finish
not
bad
at
all
and
it
packs
a
kick
to
boot
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
crave
it
a
good
warming
beer
the
wheat
offsets
the
heaviness
so
its
perhaps
not
as
rich
as
a
typical
dopplebock
i
would
have
preferred
more
estery
or
phenolic
characters
the
yeast
used
ferments
a
little
cleanly
for
my
taste
as
regards
this
style
but
its
still
quite
drinkable
drinkability

this
wb
is
oh
so
good
it
is
a
meal
in
itself
and
will
get
you
through
those
40
days
of
fasting
just
right
or
the
six
hours
between
lunch
and
dinner
this
is
a
very
good
beer
along
with
their
dunkel
weisse
erdinger
is
proving
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
german
breweries
dark
brown
in
color
huge
white
billowing
head
the
smell
was
of
burnt
malts
somewhat
acidic
taste
of
carmel
pretzel
dough
and
even
some
light
coffee
flavors
the
co2
levels
are
perfectly
balanced
in
this
impressive
find
in
rapid
city
south
dakota
i
could
definitely
session
this
one
this
poured
out
a
brown
with
a
reddish
highlights
and
a
tall
growing
beige
foam
head
the
head
recedes
fairly
quickly
to
a
cap
of
bubbles
and
doesnt
leave
any
lace
stuck
to
the
glass
only
a
trail
of
head
after
each
sip
fruity
sweet
malt
is
the
strongest
smell
in
the
aroma
fruity
malts
hit
the
palette
first
with
a
nice
sweetness
that
is
not
over
done
caramel
flavors
are
also
quite
apparent
as
is
a
dry
spicy
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
i
could
definitely
put
a
few
of
these
away
they
are
tasty
with
a
fairly
complex
taste
and
its
not
too
heavy
on
you
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
after
such
a
lovely
aroma
i
thought
i
had
found
a
winner
but
i
will
just
stick
with
my
andechs
overall
my
third
erdinger
of
the
evening
and
by
far
easily
my
biggest
favorite
of
the
trio
i
have
not
had
that
many
weizenbocks
but
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
attractive
tasty
enticing
beauty
ill
give
the
erdinger
hefeweizen
and
hefeweizen
dark
a
miss
but
i
would
certainly
buy
this
one
again
a
damn
tasty
erdinger
weissbräu
and
a
cracking
weizenbock
my
first
beer
of
the
weizenbock
variety
doesnt
seem
too
different
from
a
standard
bock
i
definently
dont
taste
much
of
what
id
usually
taste
in
a
wheat
beer
appearance
is
a
nice
dark
almost
cola
color
with
ample
light
brown
head
smell
is
a
little
weaker
than
i
expected
but
not
bad
nose
is
mostly
of
malt
mainly
caramel
and
maybe
a
little
raisin
taste
is
very
good
malty
but
not
overly
so
the
malts
werent
as
strongly
caramel
tasting
as
id
expect
in
a
bock
7
3
alcohol
is
not
evident
at
all
finish
may
be
just
a
little
too
abrupt
this
is
another
fine
beer
from
germany
and
thinking
back
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
german
beer
that
i
didnt
like
it
was
a
little
thicker
than
i
like
for
the
sweetness
involved
a
good
drinking
beer
nonetheless
erdinger
weissbier
pikantus
isnt
that
enjoyable
i
dont
have
enough
weizenbocks
under
my
belt
to
know
if
its
a
faithful
representation
of
the
style
or
not
but
it
probably
isnt
a
beer
that
ill
return
to
a
lot
of
positives
but
for
a
beer
of
7
there
is
not
enough
flavour
to
warrant
a
higher
score
of
its
erdinger
brothers
dn
im
going
to
have
to
give
this
one
a
try
next
year
just
to
see
if
maybe
i
got
hold
of
a
bad
bottle
cause
as
it
stands
this
beer
has
nothing
to
impress
me
this
beer
is
a
mixed
bag
its
not
fullbodied
nor
smooth
enough
to
be
a
great
weizenbock
and
its
too
rich
to
be
a
good
dunkelweizen
with
lower
carbonation
a
heavier
malt
bill
and
a
true
bavarian
weizen
yeast
strain
this
would
be
a
champ
as
it
is
however
it
fails
as
a
weizenbock
in
nearly
all
marks
light
to
medium
bodied
with
tingly
carbonation
and
a
rich
full
mouthfeel
warms
the
belly
but
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
this
beers
appearance
is
not
that
great
the
head
is
huge
a
grayish
light
tan
and
foamy
crusty
the
beer
is
a
dark
cloudy
brown
nose
is
a
little
better
soapy
sugary
spicy
a
little
strawberry
ok
here
we
go
sweet
fruity
front
shows
ample
alcohol
dark
caramel
malt
blooms
in
the
middle
a
little
chocolate
thick
and
creamy
finish
is
sweet
a
little
nutty
with
more
fruit
and
alcohol
this
is
a
very
fruity
malty
thick
bock
despite
the
slow
start
i
really
like
it
you
can
introduce
your
bud
drinking
buddies
to
this
with
out
a
problem
except
dont
let
them
drive
after
two
drinkability
simply
excellent
with
a
beguiling
complexity
a
rich
and
satisfying
beer
well
suited
to
a
dark
cold
day
murky
cloudy
dark
brown
liquid
with
a
hint
of
red
floating
around
the
head
is
thin
mustering
little
more
than
a
fingers
worth
and
settling
quickly
to
film
and
collar
there
are
some
spots
of
lace
but
not
much
at
all
the
nose
is
nice
mainly
caramel
reasonably
subdued
but
definitely
present
the
mouth
is
thick
with
sweetness
and
mildly
carbonated
the
taste
is
smooth
as
silk
with
caramel
tones
accompanied
by
a
hint
of
raisin
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
but
im
still
waiting
the
aftertaste
is
pure
sweet
caramel
certainly
a
pleasant
beer
expeirence
pours
with
a
dense
stickylooking
head
of
small
offwhite
bubbles
that
takes
its
time
to
go
away
frothiness
subsides
in
a
slightly
clumpy
fashion
color
of
beer
is
an
extremely
murky
nearopaque
rosewood
with
chestnutty
highlights
not
much
cling
the
lace
dripping
back
smoothly
to
build
up
at
the
collar
now
the
aroma
where
exactly
is
it
slightly
buttery
vaguely
grassy
no
real
nosefeel
at
all
at
least
it
has
some
good
tastes
mostly
a
sort
of
quenchycaramel
with
candied
fruits
up
front
developing
into
a
apple
cidery
tartness
with
a
bit
of
pear
and
a
warm
jolt
of
spice
probably
closest
to
clove
some
buttery
hops
and
a
vague
herbal
quality
to
finish
it
off
with
warmth
bubblegum
comes
out
in
the
aftertaste
a
spikily
carbonated
mouthfeel
is
yet
wet
and
quenching
with
a
slightly
sticky
sour
finish
based
on
the
mouthfeel
alone
the
drinkability
gets
pretty
high
marks
i
had
no
idea
this
brew
was
7
3
abv
and
it
caught
up
to
me
pretty
fast
thisll
serve
its
purpose
as
a
midspringearly
fall
refresher
in
workmanlike
fashion
but
dont
ask
too
much
of
it
drinkability
is
excellent
erdinger
are
a
brewery
that
while
not
making
knockout
beers
certainly
give
a
good
introduction
to
their
various
styles
and
are
all
very
drinkable
i
feel
this
makes
up
for
a
slight
lack
of
complexity
but
if
i
had
to
drink
these
all
night
in
no
way
would
i
complain
a
good
foot
in
the
door
after
some
underwhelmed
encounters
with
their
other
weizens
i
was
happy
to
be
more
satisfied
with
this
erdinger
brew
a
very
nice
dunkel
and
an
even
better
weizenbock
drinkability
is
quite
good
as
i
thirsted
for
more
when
the
bottle
was
drained
yes
thedm
this
beer
went
very
very
well
with
our
steak
supper
good
choice
this
was
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
that
was
much
to
my
liking
it
poured
a
large
sized
frothy
tan
head
with
finesmall
sized
bubbles
that
was
mostly
diminishing
the
body
was
opaque
and
carbonated
with
a
dark
brown
hue
the
nose
was
malty
and
sweet
with
a
caramel
and
brown
flavor
that
lasted
from
start
to
finish
it
had
a
very
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
it
was
light
bodied
there
was
very
sparse
lacing
with
this
beer
notes
cant
hold
aventinus
jock
but
then
who
can
certainly
enjoyed
this
and
will
no
doubt
seek
it
out
again
one
day
could
be
bolder
all
around
but
a
soild
weissbock
as
it
is
dark
brown
color
large
foamy
head
aroma
is
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
this
is
the
darkest
most
opaque
weizen
bocks
ive
seen
full
bodied
malty
slightly
nutty
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
seems
a
little
less
complex
than
most
weizen
bocks
not
very
spicy
very
smooth
flavor
alcohol
bite
is
fairly
noticeable
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
finish
not
their
best
effort
this
is
no
aventinus
but
this
isnt
bad
pours
a
nice
deep
brown
with
a
redish
tint
big
ol
frothy
head
of
about
an
inch
that
back
down
to
nearly
nothing
as
you
drink
it
the
nose
is
relatively
tame
but
interesting
oddly
enough
some
sweet
vanilla
notes
bubble
gum
some
of
the
alcohol
is
evident
also
roasted
maltiness
and
last
but
not
least
a
nice
carameltoffee
aroma
the
flavor
is
solid
but
far
from
remarkable
sweet
maltiness
almost
sugar
candy
like
the
alcohol
adds
a
bit
of
sharpness
to
it
to
keep
it
from
overwhelming
you
with
sweetness
still
pretty
one
dimensional
with
the
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
sweet
and
sticky
drinkability
is
good
id
drink
more
of
these
but
no
more
than
one
at
a
time
due
to
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
combo
sweet
tasty
and
it
packs
a
punch
it
pours
a
straight
brown
with
a
bit
white
head
that
sticks
around
leaving
lace
from
top
to
bottom
the
smell
is
a
nice
blend
of
spiciness
carameltoffee
and
a
bit
of
ripe
fruit
the
complexity
carries
over
to
the
flavor
with
all
of
the
previously
mentioned
characteristics
becoming
even
more
pronounced
especially
when
the
beer
has
warmed
just
a
bit
a
nice
yeast
bite
is
balanced
by
the
smooth
wheat
attributes
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
making
for
a
very
nice
overall
drinking
experience
weizenbocks
are
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
excellent
weizenbock
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
imo
it
is
very
chocolatey
with
a
nice
roasted
character
the
alcohol
i
present
throughout
and
the
appearance
is
opaque
dark
brown
a
nice
roasty
nose
to
this
beer
and
an
lingering
malt
presence
makes
this
one
worth
seeking
cloudy
dull
umber
brown
in
look
with
a
nice
12
inch
tan
head
of
two
separate
bubble
sizes
simple
lace
rings
yeasty
aroma
but
with
some
sense
of
cardboard
and
lime
lighterbodied
than
i
expected
a
bit
of
molasses
milk
chocolate
and
fleshy
fruit
to
the
malt
effort
a
little
bit
of
metallic
vinegar
tinges
the
end
some
off
grainy
notes
hops
are
minimal
as
expected
i
tend
to
like
weizenbocks
as
among
my
favorite
wheat
beers
but
this
was
weak
in
body
and
a
bit
suspect
in
some
of
its
malt
impression
an
ok
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
tone
with
a
cosiderable
head
of
a
whitetan
tone
the
smell
precedes
the
taste
a
very
malty
feeling
quite
light
on
hops
making
it
rather
simple
as
the
malt
strongly
perceivable
only
gives
off
scarce
sweetness
which
combines
lightly
with
any
bitterness
very
very
little
carbonation
as
well
an
ok
beer
as
i
said
before
just
o
k
muddy
brown
appearance
a
somewhat
airy
but
big
light
brown
head
sits
on
top
the
nose
consists
of
bready
yeastiness
chocolate
acetic
sourness
and
a
little
ethanol
the
prime
flavor
characteristics
i
get
in
this
one
are
phenolic
and
medicinal
obviously
not
what
i
was
looking
for
there
are
some
subtle
dark
malt
nuances
and
a
little
ethanol
sting
but
not
a
lot
else
going
on
the
mouthfeel
is
too
gaseous
makes
drinking
all
the
less
pleasurable
this
is
a
subpar
weizenbock
500ml
bottle
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
massive
tan
head
that
slowly
recedes
and
leave
delicate
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
of
malt
with
barely
a
hint
of
clove
and
banana
the
taste
is
full
of
malt
with
a
little
sweetness
but
lacking
any
real
body
not
a
bad
beer
just
seems
to
need
something
more
i
found
this
beer
pretty
enjoyable
but
not
quite
as
full
flavored
as
some
comparablesaventinus
celebrator
i
will
purchase
again
opaque
dark
brown
it
settles
like
thick
mud
but
yummy
looking
an
absolutely
enormous
head
forms
at
first
and
then
reduces
to
a
thick
coating
an
aroma
of
maltiness
and
dark
fruits
is
there
but
pretty
mellow
yeasty
and
malty
is
this
medium
bodied
brew
raisins
come
through
as
well
and
some
alcohol
touches
the
finish
its
an
enjoyable
brew
for
sure
just
not
a
preferred
style
of
mine
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
but
i
think
its
definitely
worth
a
try
ive
had
erdinger
dunkel
many
times
and
i
always
enjoyed
it
the
pinkatus
is
a
little
harder
to
find
but
well
worth
the
search
has
a
nice
almost
chocolate
flavor
and
is
quite
smooth
this
is
quite
a
subtle
brew
considering
the
abv
i
always
liked
erdinger
as
an
alternative
to
the
usual
wheat
beers
as
it
doesnt
have
the
same
spicy
clovey
taste
that
most
others
have
the
same
reason
that
many
people
dont
like
erdinger
this
pours
very
dark
brown
nice
head
good
retention
and
some
foamy
lace
a
nice
subtle
biscuity
malt
undertone
and
some
mild
complexities
not
quite
as
good
as
aventinus
but
what
is
murky
crimson
in
hue
covered
by
a
completely
uniform
formidably
thick
dense
and
sticky
tan
head
nutty
toasty
munich
w
a
healthy
dose
of
dark
caramel
and
toffee
in
aroma
mellow
banana
esters
subdued
hints
of
wheat
tartness
snap
of
sugary
bubblegum
initially
in
flavor
is
ceded
by
notes
of
carob
and
pseudofruity
melanoidins
wheat
makes
a
token
presence
by
a
grainy
tartness
mid
palate
along
with
light
clove
sweetness
is
persistantly
toffeeish
and
caramelized
in
nature
and
is
unfortunately
let
down
by
the
thin
overly
attenuated
lack
of
body
relatively
clean
esterwise
finishes
with
an
overly
brief
impression
of
chocolate
and
banana
but
otherwise
dry
and
simply
sweet
pikantus
is
an
odd
brew
it
falls
a
bit
short
of
combining
the
robust
malt
character
of
a
bock
and
the
quirky
esters
of
a
hefeweizen
tame
it
remains
quite
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
nevertheless
chocolate
brown
in
color
with
a
light
brown
head
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
when
sipped
down
the
aroma
is
rich
with
a
bready
maltiness
it
has
a
rich
bready
malty
flavor
and
hints
of
chocolate
it
is
mediumfull
in
body
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
tan
colored
head
that
fades
into
a
thin
lace
nose
is
weak
with
aromas
of
sweet
roasted
malts
and
grains
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
great
deal
of
carbonation
taste
is
sweet
malts
dark
fruit
light
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
ripe
banana
alcohol
becomes
more
noticeable
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
finish
is
dry
all
in
all
a
complex
and
enjoyable
brew
i
would
recommend
erdinger
pikantus
but
it
is
not
on
par
with
aventinus
but
what
is
enjoy
one
on
a
cold
winter
day
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
creamy
light
tan
head
that
rises
out
of
the
glass
at
first
but
then
cannot
hold
still
it
does
leave
some
lace
the
aroma
is
of
a
rich
malt
that
has
a
strong
cocoa
character
and
light
toffee
notes
soft
dark
fruit
some
mild
bubblegum
and
a
gentle
clove
its
surprisingly
rich
for
a
dunkle
as
they
tend
to
offer
less
yeasty
character
although
this
is
a
bock
as
well
the
body
is
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
starts
with
a
zesty
tingle
on
the
tongue
from
a
fine
effervescent
carbonation
as
it
warms
in
the
mouth
and
the
co2
is
released
a
soft
creaminess
takes
over
the
flavor
is
softly
fruity
mildly
tangy
and
lightly
chocolatey
upfront
warming
into
more
toffeeish
notes
as
it
crosses
the
palate
and
finishing
with
light
phenolics
and
a
clovelike
spiciness
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
this
is
obviously
balanced
towards
maltiness
but
the
alcohol
and
dark
malts
keep
it
dryer
than
a
standard
weizen
exceptionally
well
done
and
highly
drinkable
deep
garnet
to
translucent
brown
in
color
head
is
modest
in
size
the
texture
frothy

in
color
with
nice
sheets
of

but
pick
up
a
bit
as
it
adjusts
in

dry
aftertaste
relatively
big
abv
at
7
3
percent
and
i
did
expect
more
from
this
beer
than
it
delivered
why
you
might
ask
frankly
i
dont
know
another
mystery
to
be
solved
by
sampling
again
nice
medium
dark
cocolate
color
foam
nice
and
tight
but
didnt
last
long
malty
flavor
with
a
very
little
complex
of
flavors
leading
with
a
raisin
taste
good
for
introducting
people
to
a
mellow
brew
this
beer
was
smooooth
in
the
after
taste
notes
this
is
one
big
bad
wheat
beer
not
bad
but
could
be
too
big
for
some
huge
effervescent
and
bursting
all
over
with
perplexing
complexities
cloudy
dark
brown
rich
foamy
beige
head
not
much
noticable
smell
wise
some
faint
maltiness
taste
was
appropriately
malty
but
a
bit
thin
on
everything
else
lots
of
roasted
syrupy
fruit
tastes
in
the
middle
raisans
plums
bit
of
spice
doesnt
quite
met
the
expectations
light
bodied
and
not
near
as
flavorful
as
aventinius
but
still
a
very
balanced
rich
creamy
weissbock
i
liked
the
erdinger
dunkel
i
had
last
night
better
it
was
actually
had
more
body
and
better
flavor
cloudy
dark
brown
nice
tan
head
minimal
lacing
good
looking
brew
in
a
tall
weizenbier
glass
big
dark
roasted
wheat
grain
malt
aroma
some
earthy
yeast
and
a
mere
suggestion
of
esters
are
also
noted
initial
taste
is
roasted
bitterness
smooths
mellows
and
sweetens
as
it
warms
this
is
a
very
good
weizenbock
273
very
thick
offwhite
head
that
took
a
long
time
to
dissipate
nice
dark
ruby
color
with
a
faint
fruity
odor
good
lacing
after
the
first
drink
which
had
a
decent
malty
sweet
flavor
that
a
weizen
bock
should
have
when
it
comes
to
weizenbocks
there
is
simply
no
better
than
aventinus
this
doesnt
come
close
the
alchol
is
too
evident
and
its
a
bit
thin
a
really
interesting
unique
and
complex
beer
crazy
that
something
like
this
comes
from
a
german
brewery
shows
that
some
german
breweries
are
willing
to
go
way
outside
the
traditional
box
an
absolutely
fantastic
brew
and
one
unique
creation
these
guys
are
doing
great
with
these
one
offs
takes
on
german
styles
i
loved
this
beer
as
is
and
if
it
wasnt
around
a
dollar
an
ounce
i
would
buy
more
god
i
would
love
to
try
a
raspberry
or
cherry
infused
weizenbock
from
these
wheat
wizards
someday
poured
into
two
snifters
amber
brown
color
with
just
a
tiny
bit
of
film
head
plenty
of
carbonation
smell
is
very
nice
oaky
funk
taste
is
subtly
sweet
and
funky
does
not
dry
out
and
go
uber
funky
but
it
is
a
nice
subtle
funky
after
feeling
at
11
49
a
bottle
for
12
5
ozs
there
are
better
valued
beers
but
this
one
is
nice
not
very
nice
but
nice
i
would
not
call
this
a
weizenbock
like
the
style
listed
10c
bjcp
2014
it
is
a
cuvee
or
to
me
28c
soured
fruit
beer
which
is
a
blend
of
beers
which
are
then
secondary
fermented
in
a
vessel
in
this
case
the
blend
is
the
10c
types
tap
6
aventinus
and
aventinus
eisbock
the
vessels
are
french
oak
chardonnay
the
yeast
strain
for
secondary
fermentation
is
unknown
to
me
probably
lacto
or
brett
cheers
if
you
like
sour
beers
buy
it
if
not
avoid
this
beer
weizenbock
elements
are
overpowered
by
a
vinegary
acidity
the
flavors
just
dont
come
together
to
create
a
pleasant
whole
interesting
to
try
but
overpriced
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
all
year
gonna
hopefully
pick
up
a
couple
more
for
the
cellar
4
75
this
beer
reminded
me
of
the
joint
venture
of
weihenstephan
and
samuel
adams
making
the
infinium
which
was
supposed
to
unite
a
new
way
of
thinking
about
the
world
of
the
american
extreme
this
is
that
kind
of
beer
an
attempt
to
show
other
brewers
that
the
staid
germans
can
knock
off
a
geeky
item
or
two
if
they
want
this
is
not
going
to
be
a
chewy
kind
of
beer
more
sinewy
and
balanced
13
is
a
lot
to
pay
for
about
12
ozs
though
unballanced
between
sweet
and
sour
cannot
really
put
my
finger
on
it
overall
i
had
this
a
while
ago
and
remember
having
been
more
impressed
as
it
is
its
good
but
some
of
the
tartbitter
elements
detract
more
than
they
add
will
see
if
a
little
age
evens
things
out
at
all
complex
and
robustly
flavorful
nice
winter
nightcap
intense
and
barrely
lots
of
cherry
and
oak
quite
acidic
very
boozy
not
worth
the
money
this
is
a
very
good
tart
beer
not
overpowering
in
its
sour
but
not
shy
about
it
definitely
not
what
i
expected
so
i
rated
slightly
lower
than
i
actually
enjoyed
it
be
forewarned
or
intrigued
this
is
really
a
fantastic
sour
i
have
a
feeling
that
if
russian
river
put
this
out
its
rating
would
skyrocket
since
its
aventinus
its
quite
an
unexpected
flavor
profile
but
damn
is
it
good
2014
bottle
notes
that
this
is
aged
in
chardonnay
barrels
unlike
the
other
versions
i
think
which
were
aged
in
pinot
barrels
pours
deep
dark
brown
with
a
tinge
of
red
on
the
edges
and
ahalf
finger
of
off
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
aroma
is
tart
and
vinous
with
some
paint
thinner
notes
vinegar
plums
acidic
in
my
nostrils
flavor
is
sour
black
cherries
heavy
wine
notes
clean
finish
leaving
a
lightly
tart
dry
oaky
finish
on
the
palate
heavier
for
a
sour
in
the
flanders
range
of
brews
with
some
light
yet
prickly
carbonation
this
was
pretty
good
but
also
quite
a
detour
from
aventinus
o
ill
continue
to
buy
these
at
20
until
i
cant
ever
find
them
again
as
a
flemish
red
yeah
not
bad
as
a
weizenbock
particularly
one
as
worldclass
as
aventinus
disappointing
next
time
i
might
buy
the
normal
aventinus
and
a
duchesse
de
bourgogne
and
mix
them
myself
a
beer
that
shows
complexity
in
barrel
aging
that
you
can
rarely
find
people
might
say
that
it
lacks
character
relying
on
the
fact
that
its
a
tart
bomb
but
the
pairings
of
tap
6
eisbock
and
the
barriques
seems
perfectly
crafted
top
grades
prost
whoa
this
beer
is
a
huge
acetone
bomb
so
much
so
that
it
almost
completely
overwhelms
all
of
the
other
flavors
harsh
solvent
like
and
very
tough
to
drink
with
lots
of
chemical
flavor
and
vinegar
theres
some
decent
barrel
flavor
mostly
dry
oak
and
sweet
vinous
fruit
but
the
acetic
acid
is
so
overpowering
it
kills
off
most
of
the
pleasant
flavors
nothing
about
the
base
beers
stand
out
except
for
some
boozy
sweetness
and
alcohol
burn
i
like
that
they
are
experimenting
but
this
beer
is
pretty
much
an
undrinkable
mess
o
one
of
the
worst
tasting
beers
ive
ever
encountered
perhaps
it
is
just
not
my
style
but
i
would
never
drink
this
foul
tasting
beverage
ever
again
had
much
higher
hopes
for
this
as
i
love
its
2
component
beers
upon
opening
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
nice
pop
then
bittersweet
body
is
good
bottle
from
2005
oldest
beer
i
ever
tried
pretty
good
all
things
considered
the
best
weizenback
that
ive
had
enjoyed
with
a
huge
plate
of
german
food
excellent
a
lovely
brown
leather
color
bronze
at
the
bottom
and
dark
mahogany
at
the
top
of
a
weizen
glass
tons
of
tiny
tight
bubbles
shoot
up
from
the
bottom
into
a
large
merenguelike
beigetinted
head
carbonation
dominates
the
thickandheavy
mouthfeel
theres
a
slight
sweetness
with
some
banana
buttered
popcorn
berry
cobbler
and
a
pepperiness
too
the
alcohols
also
very
present
great
beer
o
im
gonna
let
the
superlatives
fly
this
is
an
amazing
beer
despite
its
seeming
simplicity
incredible
balance
between
all
the
flavors
and
while
it
is
decidedly
sweet
i
think
it
could
find
an
audience
among
a
wide
range
of
beer
drinkers
ambrosia
in
a
bottle
pours
a
caramel
color
with
a
white
head
aroma
of
caramel
toffee
brown
sugar
banana
and
clove
in
the
taste
wood
tone
rooty
hop
profile
does
a
fair
job
at
balancing
the
caramelized
malt
bread
and
clove
notes
slight
alcohol
but
good
balance
full
bodied
well
carbonated
brew
this
is
a
classic
weizenbock
the
quintessential
reminds
me
of
a
wheat
quad
i
really
enjoyed
this
overall
world
class
drink
at
every
opportunity
overall
this
is
just
an
outstanding
beer
it
seems
to
be
available
more
often
locally
now
for
the
price
this
is
one
kickass
beer
o
other
than
the
heavy
sediment
which
may
have
been
due
to
the
bottle
not
being
stored
upright
it
was
a
enjoyable
beverage
should
have
picked
up
a
current
version
to
do
a
side
by
side
this
is
an
excellent
and
classic
german
bock
the
wheat
provides
nice
body
and
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
the
8
2
abv
is
very
well
hidden
overall
this
is
one
of
the
first
weizenbocks
that
ive
tried
and
im
very
impressed
watch
out
for
the
wallop
of
alcohol
from
the
bottle
poured
into
weizen
glass
appearance
is
cloudy
medium
brown
that
rises
slowly
from
offwhite
foam
that
fills
the
glass
some
patches
of
lace
stick
to
the
glass
aroma
is
bubblegum
clove
banana
raisin
roasted
wheat
malt
and
a
whiff
of
alcohol
taste
is
dominated
by
fruity
sweetness
coming
from
the
malt
and
banana
apple
raisin
and
tropical
fruit
esters
the
sweetness
is
complimented
by
the
spicy
clove
and
anise
flavors
a
fuzz
of
alcohol
in
the
swallow
on
the
high
end
of
medium
bodied
creamy
and
thick
texture
lots
of
carbonation
sweet
estery

of
beer
this

an
impressive
and
very
drinkable
doppelbockweizenbock
very
well
rounded
and
very
well
executed
definitely
worldclass
looking
forward
to
more
from
this
brewery
bottle
of
schneider
aventinus
drank
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
since
i
first
tried
it
over
10
years
ago
theres
no
excuse
for
me
not
drinking
this
more
often
its
widely
available
and
reasonably
priced
i
love
this
beer
its
like
a
cross
between
a
dubbel
some
dark
sugar
taste
a
tripel
banana
and
a
wheat
that
combination
sounds
weird
on
paper
but
it
works
wonderfully
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
ive
had
it
on
tap
as
well
its
even
better
in
that
format
taste
fullbodied
caramel
slightly
licorice
aftertaste
is
almost
like
crown
royal
such
an
amazing
beer
perfectly

it
enjoyed
on

in
the

beer
hall
in
munich
best
beer
i
drank
while
in
bavaria
the
flavor
profile
is
world
class
intense
complex
and
perfectly
balanced
it
begins
with
a
burst
of
raisin
and
plum
that
slowly
yield
to
chocolate
notes
over
a
surprisingly
subtle
caramel
sweetness
the
middle
effervesces
into
a
burst
of
banana
and
clove
as
these
flavors
fade
a
subtle
bitterness
emerges
as
does
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
finish
is
a
slow
fade
with
notes
of
bitter
chocolate
o
enjoyable
i
expected
a
dark
fruit
character
also
didnt
get
the
bready
profile
common
in
the
style
overall
love
it
recommend
it
awesome
beer
more
pronounced
alcohol
notes
in
the
aroma
and

this
is
phenolic
and
estery
boasting
a
ton
of
allspice
clove
and
agedbruised
apple
and
pear
lower
levels
of
banana
consistent
with
the
color
there
is

the

or

discernible
wellcarbonated
served
on
tap
into
a
small
6oz
lady
glass
kind
of
a
tiny
tulip
thing
deep
brown
with
ruby
around
the
edges
and
a
12
finger
of
eggshell
head
that
held
pretty
tight
had
some
notes
reminiscent
of
my
experiences
with
tripels
got
some
distinct
notes
of
licorice
clove
and
dark
fruit
on
the
nose
ripe
banana
clove
on
the
palate
extremely
fresh
tasting
medium
mouthfeel
just
as
clean
and
crisp
as
can
be
great
beer
experience
o
i
prefer
vitus
to
this
in
all
honesty
but
this
version
of
a
weizenbock
is
definitely
a
better
option
for
cold
weather
with
its
darker
character
and
higher
alcohol
recommended
heavenly
this
beer
and
brewery
on
top
of
my
favorites
list
pours
a
big
foamy
head
which
rests
nicely
colours
is
a

dark

beer
in
the
world
definitely
my
favorite
in
the
style
my
every

which
shows
great
mastery
an
incredible
beer
for
the
category
with
a
slight
fruit
taste
and
creamy
feel
overall
absolutely
delicious
very
complex
and
one
of
my
favorite
beer
ever
tasted
o
i
love
this
style
i
dont
know
much
about
it
but
this
brew
in
particular
is
very
sweet
strong
in
abv
but
easy
to
drink
with
all
the
alcohol
hidden
lots
of
darker
fruit
tastes
only
the
slight
sourness
in
the
nose
tips
off
the
wheat
otherwise
it
comes
off

is
an

with
a
very

which
strikes
me
as

only

have
to
say
right
off
the
bat
that
this
is
possibly
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
i
poured
the
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
and
it
appeared
a
nice
dark

color
that
produced

one
of
those
few
beers
that
stays
on
your
tongue
for
hours
after
you
finish
it
in
fact
while
i
have
only
had
it
a
few
times
i
can
almost
recall
the
flavors
at
will
i
have
had
it
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
i
would
not
worry
too
much
about
the
freshness
factor
the
bottle
i
had
was
nearing
its
best
by
date
and
was
still
amazing
o
a
sipper
holds
up
against
moderate
belgian
offerings
second
half
went
down
much
faster
than
the
first
o
when
you
want
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
the
popular
american
styles
a
world
class
weizenbock
can
sure
hit
the
spot
overall
very
nice
stuff
a
bit
too
sweet
to
go
through
much
of
but
very
nice
had
out
of
a
bottle
at
do
brassiere
in
albany
awesome
first
of
all
havent
had
a
bock
in
awhile
and
although
not
my
favorite
i
went
due
to
the
high
rating
the
ruby
red
color
and
little
head
was
different
this
smelled
so
fruity
i
was
surprised
had
belgium
all
over
it
which
is
great
it
is
a
yeasty
malty
wheat
beer
with
the
perfect
blend
of
fruit
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
bock
i
am
used
to
i
love
this
beer
perfect
o
described
as
a
wheat
dopplebock
this
is
more
dark
fruityeast
dominated
than
i
had
expected
wont
buy
it
again
because
dark
fruit
prunes
plums
and
such
is
not
a
personal
favorite
flavor
in
beer
and
this
was
not
cheap
at
6
a
pint
nonetheless
it
was
nice
to
try
to
get
an
idea
of
why
it
is
101
on
the
ba
top
250
not
my
favorite
style
by
any
means
but
thats
still
an
incredibly
good
beer
o
this
is
a
great
beer
plain
and
simple
love
the
mixture
of
all
of
the
flavors
looks
like
root
beer
with
a
little
cream
in
it
smells
like
a
spice
that
i
cant
identify
might
be
cloves
or
sassafras
mouth
feel
is
medium
fully
engages
the
taste
buds
salivary
glands
say
pungent
in
the
best
possible
way
this
could
be
one
of
the
best
beers
tasted
yet
tap
6
is
a
beer
ill
always
be
happy
to
drink
pours
a
murky
amberbrown
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
fades
fairly
slowly
smell
is
toffee
dark
fruits
carmel
bananas
and
cloves
taste
is
slightly
similar
to
a
hefenweizen
slightly
sweet
with
some
of
the
wheat
and
the
flavors
in
the
nose
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
with
decent
carbonation
very
smooth
overall
a
great
beer
worth
trying
this
one
was
a
winner
enjoyed
it
a
lot
a
good
malty
wheat
beer
for
a
nightcap
multiple

and
500ml

a
muddy

a
huge

with
great
lacing
and
retention
aromas
of
cloves
yeast
black
cherries

chocolate
and
dunkelweizen
banana
split
with
chocolate
drizzle
taste
is
dark
cherry
dessert
milk
chocolate
banana
mild
alcohol
sweetness
really
good
classically
the
richest
wheat
beer
around
overall
beautiful
beer
more
complexity
to
taste
than
i
would
have
imagined
a
pleasure
to
drink
for
any
occasion
the
kind
of
beer
that
should
be
reserved
for
special
company
ive
recently
drank
piraat
and
trappiste
rochefort
8
and
10
all
worldclass
beers
and
i
generally
prefer
belgian
beers
but
this
german
beer
tops
them
all
overall
worth
the
hype
they
changed
the
bottle
that
i
got
still
a
great
brew
inside
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
is
clearly
the
best
dark
wheat
beer
ive
had
it
has
little
carbonation
notes
on
the
tounge
with
a
full
caramel
and
dark
fruit
taste
that
is
nicely
balanced
and
not
overly
sweet
like
most
doppelbocks
maybe
one
of
the
top
3
beers
in
the
world
soft
on
the
palate
with
hints
of
caramel
and
floral
notes
this
is
a
beer
loaded
with
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
fans
of
both
light
and
dark
beers
will
enjoy
aventinus
this
beer
belongs
in
every
beer
lovers
collection
this
is
candy
in
a
glass
absolutely
outstanding
o
i
love
wheat
beers
im
usually
a
bigger
fan
of
the
typical
hefeweizen
but
i
do
like
to
try
some
of
the
darker
wheat
beers
after
weihenstephaner
dunkel
this
is
the
best
dark
wheat
beer
ive
ever
tried
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
all
year
round
and
i
can
see
it
pairing
great
with
a
steak
on
the
grill
it
was
hard
to
keep
this
one
in
my
glass
and
as
i
was
so
pleasantly
surprised
by
it
i
am
planning
a
trip
back
to
the
lcbo
to
buy
another
few
bottles
for
the
weekend
if
you
like
wheat
beers
or
dark
beers
or
any
kind
of
beer
of
quality
get
this
beer
overall
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
the
first
one
i
tried
from
this
brewery
but
i
will
be
back
for
more
a
nice
cold
weather
beer
try
it
and
then
try
it
again
overall
having
this
beer
encourages
me
to
try
to
brew
a
weizenbock
at
home
a
wonderful
balance
of
wheat
darker
malts
and
spicy
yeast

amazing
mf
well
carbonated
sharp
on
the
palate
full
bodied
overall
as
stated
right
off
this
fine
weizenbock
is
a
cornerstone
it
is
a
beast
it
is
great
if
you
have
been
skeptical
of
german
beers
if
you
think
they
are
predictable
and
hohum
if
you
just
havent
had
it
buy
it
if
you
see
it
you
wont
be
sorry
i
havent
been
ever
since
the
first
one
i
had
years
ago
overall
i
think
this
beer
might
be
the
epitome
of
decadence
and
is
probably
about
the
tastiest
beer
i
could
imagine
while
enjoying
desserts
at
christmas
time
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
and
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
glass
seems
to
be
empty
too
quickly
wow
o
incredible
complex
balanced
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
ill
keep
coming
back
to
when
its
available
o
my
1st
weizenbock
and
its
a
dandy
certainly
world
class
tastewhere
to
begin
a
flavor
meld
of
clove
banana
blueberry
dark
malt
grapeskin
milk
chocolate
shavings
fruity
tangy
each
sip
a
different
flavor
combination
upon
warming
a
bit
i
get
bluberry
pancakes
with
light
syrup
dark
fruits
and
dark
bread
bread
pudding
with
raisins
a
complex
flavorfull
mysterious
brew
that
must
be
experienced
excellent
would
get
again
in
a
second
must
be
heavenly
on
tap
o
im
somewhat
disappointed
i
couldnt
seem
to
like
this
beer
as
much
as
other
people
seem
too
but
none
the
less
it
was
a
good
beer
it
was
my
first
wiezenbock
it
was
just
okay
but
nothing
astounding
in
my
opinion
i
probably
will
revisit
it
again
in
the
future
to
see
if
my
tastes
for
it
have
changed
just
not
exactly
to
my
liking
but
decent
beer
i
suppose
othis
is
a
great
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
find
more
often
there
is
something
odd
about
the
mix
of
chocolate
and
wheat
flavors
that
really
works
well
here
and
makes
for
a
good
summer
beer
even
at
8
2
abv
this
is
my
favorite
of
beer
of
this
style
by
far
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beer
tons
of
toffee
flavor
and
caramel
sweetness
an
excellent
mouthfeel
and
standard
appearance
make
for
my
favorite
doppelbock
yet
o
this
beer
fulfilled
my
expectations
and
then
some
i
will
definitely
enjoy
this
again
i
feel
about
this
as
i
do
about
xmas
fruit
cake
regift
lots
of
flavour
to
the
point
this
is
one
great
beer
years
ago
when
i
had
it
for
the
first
time
the
beer
it
was
love
at
first
sip
i
really
want
to
give
it
a
perfect
score
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
i
rarely
drink
but
when
i
do
this
is
the
beer
i
have
the
taste
is
really
indescribably
but
to
me
if
there
is
a
heaven
this
is
what
is
served
there
it
tastes
that
good
it
has
a
very
dark
look
to
it
wonderful
body
great
head
when
you
pour
it
in
a
glass
to
me
its
pretty
much
the
perfect
beer
put
this
one
on
your
bucket
list
of
beers
to
try
and
taste
what
perfection
really
is
o
best
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
best
german
beer
ive
ever
had
best
lager
ive
ever
had
really
the
only
downside
is
the
alcohol
is
too
high
to
make
it
sessionable
although
i
know
thats
a
positive
for
some
folks
o
interesting
wheatdoppblebock
combination
complex
yet
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
full
but
light
with
that
classic
wheat
feel
and
great
carbonation
excellent
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
most
complex
massproduced
recipes
out
of
germany
and
its
clear
where
it
gets
its
praise
from
tons
of
well
balanced
juicy
flavors
and
delicious
bready
and
yeasty
characteristics
that
further
enhance
them
absolutely
an
easy
beer
to
drink
with
its
crisp
smoothened
body
and
at
8
2
a
dangerous
choice
at
that
this
is
definitely
something
ill
treat
myself
more
often
to
from
time
to
time
fantastic
stuff
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
i
had
during
my
stay
in
germany
and
one
i
have
returned
to
many
times
since
a
musttry
and
goldstandard
for
weizenbocks
overall
a
magnificent
beer
that
deserves
its
place
amongst
the
finest
in
the
world
o
this
is
one
damn
good
beer
i
love
a
good
weizenbock
and
i
have
yet
to
find
a
better
one
than
this
worldbeating
stuff
why
is
weizenbock
so
unknownunderappreciated
its
crazy
i
love
this
beer
you
pop
the
cap
and
get
this
amazing
banana
smell
it
pours
like
a
picture
of
what
a
perfect
beer
should
look
like
great
color
cloudy
unfiltered
liquid
bread
take
your
first
sip
expecting
it
to
be
very
heavy
while
the
flavor
definitely
socks
you
in
the
mouth
it
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
which
at
8
2
can
be
a
bit
precarious
have
a
driver
or
better
yet
stay
home
this
beer
is
a
great
way
to
end
a
day
b
o
my
second
doppelbock
in
as
many
nights
and
its
amazing
how
well
they
are
made
its
not
fair
to
compare
them
to
any
other
beer
as
it
may
do
them
an
extreme
disservice
their
flavors
certainly
makes
up
for
were
they
lack
in
looks
and
smell
i
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
for
this
if
you
love
beer
then
this
is
a
must
try
overall
to
me
this
tastes
like
a
trappist
beer
from
belgium
mixed
with
a
dunkelweizen
decent
brew
but
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
it
tries
to
be
too
many
things
at
once
i
would
rather
have
a
franziskaner
dunkelweiss
or
rochefort
if
you
want
something
similar
but
a
little
more
drinkable
may
get
more
in
the
future
to
try
again
but
as
of
now
i
prefer
their
hefe
the
guy
that
calls
this
beer
the
best
beer
ever
must
not
have
a
very
refined
palate
its
good
but
it
is
by
no
means
the
best
beer
in
the
world
actually
the
best
beer
in
the
world
according
to
ratebeer
isnt
even
that
good
cool
story
but
quads
are
just
not
my
style
they
did
a
good
job
with
this
bottle
and
i
am
going
to
look
at
where
those
plum
flavors
are
coming
from
best
part
of
this
offering
cheers
i
wouldnt
normally
aged
a
hefeweizen
or
weizenbock
but
i
bet
this
one
stands
up
real
well
to
a
few
years
overall
very
easy
drinking
and
plenty
of
flavour
quite
tasty
and
i
can
see
how
so
many
people
love
this
even
though
its
not
my
favorite
style
this
beer
is
a
long
time
favorite
recently
retried
for
reviewing
purposes
the
appearance
is
wonderful
nice
dark
caramel
in
color
with
a
retentive
whiteishcream
head
smell
is
wonderful
clean
earthy
lightly
spiced
with
clove
taste
is
delicious
i
get
clove
sweet
malt
a
slight
licorice
flavor
and
a
sweet
yeasty
type
note
as
well
the
feel
of
the
beer
in
my
mouth
is
what
i
remember
liking
most
about
this
beer
its
very
creamy
and
light
and
leaves
a
smooth
silty
finish
the
aftertaste
is
of
ripe
banana
yum
pours
a
murky
reddish
amber
with
a
layer
of
creamy
off
white
head
good
retention
the
smell
contains
some
dark
fruit
bready
malt
and
a
mild
brown
sugar
sweetness
the
taste
is
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
with
some
yeast
spice
a
touch
of
booze
dark
fruit
and
some
banana
p
s
as
i
swallow
each
mouthfull
of
this
beer
i
get
pungent
mouthfulls
of
christmas
spicy
flavours
running
over
the
palette
this
really
is
something
special
one
week
left
in
germany
before
i
return
to
asia
note
to
self
must
go
to
beershop
tomorrow
and
get
a
few
more
of
these
in
o
wow
this
is
quite
a
beer
it
seems
so
incredibly
complicated
flavors
showing
and
then
disappearing
a
second
later
flavors
that
shine
fade
and
then
shine
again
sweet
tart
smokey
and
intense
i
kinda
like
it
but
i
dont
know
if
im
fully
enjoying
this
beer
i
might
not
drink
this
beer
again
but
its
quite
an
experience
drinkability
why
did
i
wait
so
long
to
have
this
world
class
beer
and
model
weizenbock
overall
exceptional
and
well
worth
looking
out
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
what
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
a
bit
sweet
and
could
use
a
bit
more
tartness
nevertheless
i
feel
as
if
i
could
spend
hours
sipping
on
it
and
writing
down
all
the
different
flavors
i
encounter
if
all
you
drink
are
stouts
and
ipas
you
need
to
start
exploring
classic
beers
like
this
one
pick
up
a
bottle
close
your
eyes
tune
out
the
noise
and
just
sip
and
enjoy
o
this
is
a
world
class
beer
i
cant
imagine
a
better
weizenbock
just
so
rich
sweet
and
creamy
but
somehow
its
beyond
drinkable
man
i
love
this
beer
overall
a
decent
strong
flavoured
wheat
beer
a
good
combination
of
wheat
malts
spices
banana
and
cloves
and
dark
fruits
quite
expensive
but
certainly
worth
it
every
now
and
then
few
beers
have
blown
me
away
as
this
has
in
30
years
of
beer
drinking
this
is
my
holy
grail
bread
and
fruit
in
the
most
amazing
combination
maybe
a
touch
of
spice
and
toffee
i
really
can
not
add
anything
that
hasnt
already
been
said
by
others
that
have
appreciated
the
beers
amazing
qualities
if
you
are
a
fan
of
this
style
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
it
definitely
wold
class
o
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
very
malt
forward
and
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
for
the
level
of
malts
i
can
see
this
pairing
with
heartier
foods
or
maybe
dessert
you
know
because
of
the
ratings
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
its
good
but
it
isnt
standout
to
me
from
other
big
wheaty
bocks
the
pour
is
the
best
asset
its
dark
caramel
in
color
with
a
lavish
off
white
head
thick
as
whipped
cream
and
lasting
forever
way
above
the
rim
pure
sex
the
nose
is
real
fruity
like
apples
and
pears
and
grapes
and
of
course
dark
malted
wheat
and
german
ale
yeast
flavor
sees
a
lot
less
fruit
than
the
nose
it
has
an
almost
rotting
fruit
taste
composty
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
for
the
style
the
alcohol
is
long
lasting
and
in
fact
dramatic
when
it
warms
a
detractor
in
this
context
the
yeast
imparts
a
lot
of
nice
flavor
a
little
banana
a
touch
of
peppery
spice
and
plenty
of
body
fuller
with
excited
carbonation
and
a
long
fruitcake
finish
overall
a
tasty
beer
and
a
good
step
in
my
new
german
beer
interest
but
i
think
its
a
touch
out
of
balance
not
least
because
of
the
robust
booze
vibe
well
made
but
not
my
personal
first
choice
aventinus
is
an
excellent
wheat
bock
thats
worthy
of
the
praise
it
receives
among
the
few
dark
wheat
beers
ive
had
to
date
it
stands
above
the
rest
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
dark
citrus
wheat
sweet
malt
slight
hops
hint
of
pale
malt
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
weizenbock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
dark
citrus
wheat
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
hint
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
overall
decent
appearance
great
aroma
and
body
and
good
feel
and
blend
hm
i
still
think
i
prefer
weihenstephaner
vitus
to
this
beer
but
theres
no
denying
that
this
is
still
some
good
stuff
i
dont
know
if
im
wellversed
enough
in
weizenbocks
to
accurately
rank
this
one
among
the
rest
but
it
was
definitely
tasty
and
dangerously
drinkable
for
being
8

abv
murky
brown
out
of
the

thin
persistent

raisins
dates
and

apparent
tobacco

raisins
flavors
come
through
rather
sharp

to
it
some

of

definitely
something
to
enjoy
with

on
a
cold

day
prost
lampertland
o
this
is
a
wonderful
wheat
beer
its
very
big
yet
carries
all
the
grace
of
a
beer
half
its
abv
its
smooth
spicy
integrated
sweet
and
very
easy
to
drink
im
drinking
this
beer
on
the
couch
next
to
my
wife
in
front
of
the
tv
but
i
can
only
imagine
that
my
enjoyment
of
it
would
be
even
higher
in
front
of
a
fire
with
friends
and
family
and
of
course
my
wife
o
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
clearly
deserves
the
praise
that
it
receives
i
cant
say
ive
had
many
wheatdopplebocks
but
this
would
be
the
best
ive
had
thus
far
delightful
glad
to
recommend
o
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
similar
our
of
both
glasses
overall
i
would
recommend
the
weizen
glass
over
the
flute
just
because
the
wider
mouth
allows
for
more
aromatics
and
the
larger
volume
allowed
for
more
of
a
pour
to
get
a
bigger
head
as
far
as
the
beer
itself
ill
leave
my
notes
above
to
give
it
the
justice
it
deserves
worldclass
o
very
good
weiss
with
all
the
usual
notes
but
a
smoother
feel
than
most
served
from
a
bottle
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
when
i
visit
germany
this
year
o
buy
it
if
you
dont
want
it
by
all
means
send
it
on
to
va
for
the
price
and
flavor
there
is
no
better
beer
like
this
readily
available
in
just
about
any
market
superb
stuff
just
as
i
remembered
the
classic
weizenbock
i
get
a
strong
banana
taste
which
is
something
ive
never
understood
in
others
reviews
before
the
color
and
look
of
the
brew
is
is
awesome
hearty
sums
it
up
well
if
i
had
to
desire
something
more
in
the
appearance
it
would
be
a
tad
more
foam
the
charcoal
aroma
is
gone
and
i
get
some
of
that
banana
in
the
smell
which
isnt
sweet
but
definitely
distinct
i
suppose
i
am
rehashing
the
traits
because
i
am
leading
up
to
giving
this
one
a
5
almost
straight
across
the
board
ill
get
a
few
more
later
and
resample
for
posterity
sake
and
because
i
want
to
be
accurate
but
this
one
is
simply
delightful
yet
serious
so
for
my
favorite
in
englandscotland
it
is
belhaven
wee
heavy
for
belgium
it
is
st
bernardus
tripel
and
while
i
have
had
an
eternal
love
affair
with
most
things
german
i
have
to
say
that
since
reviewing
ro
ba
this
one
tops
my
list
lots
of
great
brews
from
germanyaustria
but
this
one
inches
a
nose
above
i
can
justify
the
5
for
smell
now
my
sniffer
was
a
little
off
at
the
beginning
o
flat
out
yummy
and
the
perfect
example
of
this
style
o
love
it
bananaraisontoffee
butterscotch
wheat
i
could
easily
put
down
a
number
of
these
well
until
those
8
2
abvs
caught
up
with
me
so
good
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
by
far
the
best
german
weizenbock
i
have
had
so
far
its
very
good
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
to
it
it
was
smooth
with
lots
of
nice
flavors
to
hold
my
attention
but
its
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
so
i
think
one
500ml
bottle
is
the
perfect
amount
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
everything
all
aspects
of
this
beer
were
right
were
they
should
be
and
done
very
well
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
i
cant
think
of
single
thing
that
i
didnt
like
about
this
beer
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
really
good
weizenbock
and
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
all
in
all
i
was
very
happy
and
impressed
with
this
beer
its
the
german
weizenbock
ive
been
searching
for
and
im
glad
i
finally
found
it
i
still
think
i
like
black
forests
weizenbock
just
a
little
more
but
for
being
available
year
round
and
im
sure
this
will
be
my
go
to
weizenbock
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
it
was
very
good
and
everybody
should
try
it
enough
said
o
best
of
both
worlds
of
a
dopplebock
and
hefeweizen
in
this
one
no
one
flavor
really
dominates
but
it
all
goes
together
really
nicely
really
good
it
made
my
mouth
water
some
must
get
more
i
got
this
one
on
tap
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
local
flying
saucer
had
it
in
stock
and
it
was
a
very
good
beer
but
the
reason
i
wanted
it
so
bad
was
to
try
the
original
german
version
of
texass
live
oak
primus
dont
get
me
wrong
aventinus
was
good
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
primus
it
had
a
staleness
to
it
it
didnt
taste
as
alive
and
primal
as
primus
it
was
therefore
more
boring
it
had
a
good
mustiness
to
it
but
not
much
accompanying
banana
flavour
that
i
liked
so
much
about
live
oaks
weizenbock
still
a
very
decent
beer
though
ill
probably
have
it
again
one
day
but
im
in
no
rush
exceptionally
smooth
very
dark
brown
and
intensely
malty
with
a
sweetness
and
fruitiness
that
makes
it
seem
almost
like
a
belgian
doppelbock
actually
it
is
a
weizendoppelbock
rather
than
simply
a
weizenbock
abundant
apples
pears
and
banana
in
aroma
and
taste
slight
acidic
twang
mixed
with
the
sweet
roasted
malt
finishes
it
off
perfectly
cloudy
and
complex
yet
very
drinkable
and
goes
well
with
food
one
of
the
best
bavarian
beers
available
in
bottles
in
the
us
it
is
a
must
try
pours
cloudy
brownish
with
small
white
head
smells
of
banana
yeast
funk
pears
taste
is
like
pear
juice
and
cinnamon
spice
sweet
but
subdued
nice
wheat
flavor
in
this
with
a
bit
of
spice
the
spice
and
fruit
allow
this
to
finish
with
a
smooth
sweetness
on
the
palate
and
crisp
enough
to
make
very
drinkable
very
nice
beer
and
my
first
of
the
style
personal
rate
4
25
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
i
thought
it
was
nice
and
mellow
with
a
lot
of
flavor
its
one
of
the
few
beers
ive
had
from
schneider
weisse
that
still
tastes
very
good
when
imported
if
not
the
only
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
o
a
true
standard
bearer
for
the
style
and
very
enjoyable
its
complex
in
nature
but
balanced
perfectly
way
too
easy
too
drink
for
the
abv
it
could
be
dangerous
had
at
andreas
keller
in
leavenworth
wa
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
with
a
huge
foamy
tan
head
fruity
aroma
with
slight
smell
of
banana
perhaps
was
hard
to
place
surprised
by
the
tartness
of
this
beer
though
i
enjoyed
it
slight
sour
apple
notes
full
body
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
very
warming
great
beer
a
delicious
brew
warming
and
flavorful
expected
a
little
more
malt
presence
but
the
esters
are
delicious
o
a
very
easy
review
and
a
no
brainer
4
5
all
day
it
fits
the
description
of
a
weizenbock
perfectly
the
only
flaw
i
can
think
of
is
strictly
personal
preference
and
no
fault
of
the
brewer
though
the
label
say
banana
so
maybe
it
is
this
has
more
of
a
bubblegum
aromaflavor
and
i
love
a
banana
aromaflavor
either
way
its
awesome
and
i
highly
recommend
it
o
not
an
everyday
beer
this
is
one
for
special
occasions
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
although
it
married
well
with
a
plate
of
currywurst
spaetzle
i
enjoyed
it
more
after
the
meal
when
i
could
focus
on
its
flavors
without
distraction
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
tried
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
fan
of
weizen
or
not
overall
i
do
not
drink
this
style
often
to
be
honest
but
this
was
a
great
experience
the
complexity
and
balance
of
this
beer
is
incredible
and
i
hope
to
have
it
again
o
would
purchase
again
and
recommend
to
others
it
tastes
like
a
hefeweizens
darker

with
a
half
finger

head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal

very
quickly
maintained
excellent

throughout
the

the

was

the

was

it
had
a

on

overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
age
really
did
a
lot
of
good
stuff
for
this
one
if
i
am
honest
the
flavors
were
quite
complex
and
the
aroma
had
really
developed
into
something
special
the
alcohol
aspect
was
completely
gone
and
made
this
one
really
easy
drinking
for
something
with
this
abv
i
suggest
setting
a
few
of
these
aside
to
age
in
your
cellar
if
you
have
the
patience
as
this
one
was
awesome
at
6
years
old
no
where
do
you
taste
alcohol
because
is
is
such
a
complex

caramelbananas

deserving
of
your
original

5
rating
a
swarm
of

sweetened
oatmeal
with
red

on
the
cleansing

overall
this
is
one
tasty
and
very
drinkable
brew
it
is
renowned
for
a
reason
very
well
done
tons
of
great
flavor
and
an
overall
joy
to
drink
o
a
well
balanced
tasty
uncharacteristically
refreshing
beer
thats
comparable
to
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
but
with
a
bigger
alcohol
kick
looks
dark
tastes
light
nice
definitely
cant
beat
the
price
does
not
have
the
bitter
bite
of
some
other
high
percentage
beers
o
this
is
an
amazing
beer
it
has
the
best
of
2
worlds
and
its
a
go
to
in
my
fridge
overall
its
a
damned
good
beer
im
warming
up
to
the
germans
fairly
inexpensive
and
packs
a
good
punch
along
with
a
lot
of
flavor
heck
of
an
offering
lots
of
flavor
nice
complexity
but
it
doesnt
hold
up
in
the
long
run
a
bit
too
much
with
some
lacking
warm
depth
still
worth
drinking
and
trying
a
great
testament
to
the
style
o
flavorful
and
drinkable
some
weizenbocks
ive
had
have
been
too
dry
and
overattenuated
but
this
has
a
nice
balanced
sweetness
to
it
great
weizenbock
aventinus
pours
out
a
muddy
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
and
wheaty
with
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
just
fantastic
the
caramel
malts
provide
the
right
amount
of
balance
to
the
bananay
yeast
that
overwhelms
me
in
so
many
other
beers
the
wheat
rounds
out
everything
a
masterful
composition
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
and
tingly
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
widely
available
and
cheap
beer
highly
recommended
o
the
appearance
of
this
beer
let
me
down
a
gentle
pour
left
me
with
no
head
whatsoever
but
this
style
should
be
billowing
with
carbonation
the
smell
definitely
showed
off
a
nice
ester
profile
and
left
room
for
some
malt
to
shine
through
there
was
nice
layering
to
the
taste
i
could
taste
malt
phenols
and
wheat
at
different
times
which
is
a
great
and
elongated
flavor
had
the
correct
body
and
sweetness
but
did
lack
on
carbonation
alcohol
was
masked
well
under
many
great
flavors
to
this
good
beer
o
not
my
favorite
weizenbock
vitus
but
a
really
nice
option
for
when
i
want
something
more
interesting
than
a
standard
hefeweizen
drinkability
im
surprised
how
quickly
i
finished
this
one
of
all
time
great
weizen
beers
its
a
must
have
for
variety
however
i
dont
see
it
as
a
beer
you
can
spend
the
night
putting
down
o
very
tasty
not
sure
how
much
the
flavor
has
changed
over
time
due
to
the
fact
i
havent
had
a
fresh
one
in
awhile
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
very
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
poured
into
my
wheat
beer
glass
maybe
i
didnt
pour
all
the
yeast
out
because
it
wasnt
quite
as
cloudy
as
i
was
expecting
it
was
a
fairly
clean
body
overall
light
brown
with
offwhite
head
that
dissolves
quickly
notes
of
ripe
fruit
on
the
nose
sort
of
rumlike
character
wheat
taste
miced
with
apple
and
other
darker
fruits
to
the
taste
with
moderate
yeast
a
unique
brew
doesnt
fall
into
my
favorites
but
it
is
very
good
i
dont
usually
reach
for
weizen
anything
but
this
stands
among
the
best
of
its
kind
overall
very
smooth
and
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
evident
but
not
solventy
o
an
interesting
and
wellmade
beer
but
maybe
not
something
id
come
back
to
over
and
over
i
might
be
inclined
to
revisit
it
on
a
cold
night
as
a
lighter
alternative
to
a
barleywine
the
first
few
sips
i
was
quite
overwhelmed
its
a
proper
complex
beer
10
minutes
later
the
glass
was
empty
though
and
i
couldnt
believe
it
keep
an
eye
on
this
one
itll
have
you
pounding
the
glass
without
even
realizing
it
o
great
complex
flavors
insure
that
careful
sipping
will
reward
any
fan
of
great
beer
warm
almost
burnt
notes
join
traditional
hefe
flavors
of
banana
and
citrus
in
a
heavier
cider
brown
beer
certainly
an
experience
and
a
worthwhile
one
at
that
a
great
beer
and
solid
style
dynamic
and
interesting
certainly
quite
a
big
beer
but
was
happy
to
spot
this
one
in
the
lcbo
and
would
pick
it
up
again
o
not
my
style
of
beer
but
easy
to
see
why
this
is
considered
a
worldclass
weizenbock
it
is
in
fact
the
best
ive
had
the
fruitiness
and
complexity
make
this
one
seem
somewhat
similar
to
a
dark
belgian
brew
since
this
aged
version
was
bottled
at
the
brewery
it
probably
should
have
a
separate
listing
i
see
other
2008
reviews
here
that
are
probably
from
this
bottling
but
will
review
it
here
for
now
a
great
ale
that
obviously
improves
with
age
o
great
complexity
in
the
flavours
of
this
weizenbock
but
the
mouth
feel
could
use
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
pours
a
hazy
dark
murky
brown
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
the
nose
is
a
spicy
dark
fruit
brew
with
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
this
beer
is
very
bready
has
a
lot
of
dark
fruits
and
a
caramelized
taste
and
feel
this
beer
has
a
rather
smooth
feel
but
is
still
a
rather
massive
beer
there
is
a
slight
sour
bitterness
to
this
beer
that
seems
a
bit
out
of
place
but
doesnt
hurt
the
beer
rather
then
set
it
apart
from
the
others
a
solid
doppelbockweizenbock
would
drink
again
nice
looking
clear
amber
beer
with
a
off
white
head
that
left
ample
lacing
a
nice
malty
aroma
with
wheat
overtones
obvious
germany
hops
and
flavoring
but
a
little
more
complexity
that
most
other
german
beers
i
have
enjoyed
i
was
excited
to
find
this
beer
and
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
d
its
easy
to
see
why
this
is
considered
a
classic
brew
by
many
just
an
all
around
well
crafted
and
deceptively
drinkable
german
beer
although
as
mentioned
before
this
is
fairly
similar
to
a
belgian
dark
ale
or
dubbel
while
this
brew
brings
to
the
table
what
most
other
darker
german
beers
do
it
has
a
greater
depth
to
the
profile
increased
complexity
and
unique
subtleties
that
really
separate
it
from
the
pack
this
definitely
wont
be
my
last
aventinus
very
interesting
id
like
to
try
this
aged
a
few
years
i
had
the
eisbock
and
thought
it
was
too
heavy
but
this
is
surprisingly
light
and
more
complex
will
try
again
a
pretty
solid
beer
with
some
good
flavor
notes
alcohol
is
under
control
but
the
finish
is
a
little
rough
o
complex
and
wonderful
overall
a
phenomenal
beer
that
is
top
of
its
class
im
very
impressed
with
how
easy
going
this
beer
is
would
love
to
try
a
fresh
pint
in
germany
this
is
a
very
good
dunkel
weisse
dark
color
cream

that
lasts
as
long
as
the
beer
slightly

and
slightly

it
is
better
on

in
munich
but
the
bottled
tap

is
almost
as
good
we
bought
a
case
and
finished
before
leaving
germany
three
weeks
later
the
first
was
as
good
as
the
last
it
is
much
better

there
is

can

its

something
to

liked

more
rjt
d
why
did
i
wait
so
long
to
try
this
overall
very
good
brew
never
had
a
wheat
dopplebock
before
but
this
one
stands
up
to
the
best
dopplebocks
ive
had
very
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
just
a
very
well
balanced
high
gravity
brew
overall
a
great
weizenbock
made
even
better
by
its
wide
availability
and
relative
affordability
being
a
bit
more
of
an
obscure
style
i
cant
say
ive
yet
tasted
a
better
one
not
a
beer
that
i
would
have
multiple
of
in

certainly
one
that
i
crave

enjoy

quite

with
a

which
is
a

different
than
the
hefe

a

abv
well
feels
is
nice
but
a

good
carbonation
aand
a

lively
on

overall
a
great
effort
and
tastes
like
a
hefe
on
steroids
great
fruit
notes
on
the
front
complex
throughout
love
the
apple
quality
and
the
blend
of
malt
bomb
and
adequate
hops
the
fig
hit
was
also
a
welcome
surprise
very
solid
brew
that
i
will
hit
again
this
is
definitely
different
than
i
expected
but
then
again
this
is
my
first
weizenbock
this
kind
of
tastes
like
a
yeasty
more
alcoholic
german
hefeweizen
with
some
touches
of
funk
and
chocolate
interesting
but
its
a
little
too
yeasty
with
too
much
alcohol
flavor
especially
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
pours
cloudy
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
tan
head
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
very
little
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
it
appears
to
be
well
carbonated
there
are
smells
of
sweet
malt
esters
such
as
banana
and
bubblegum
and
alcohol
there
are
other
dark
fruits
such
as
raisin
and
prunes
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
reflects
the
taste
there
are
sweet
malts
fruit
and
bubblegum
flavors
there
is
some
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
its
not
very
strong
for
a
beer
above
8
abv
there
yeast
is
also
in
the
taste
theres
a
mild
aftertaste
the
body
is
light
with
abundant
carbonation
the
carbonation
helps
chase
away
the
aftertaste
making
this
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
with
high
drinkability
this
pours
a
cloudy
amber
brown
with
creamy
foam
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
with
some
bubblegum
and
cloves
as
well
as
banana
notes
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
samei
get
some
bubblegummy
banana
and
clove
maltiness
as
i
sip
it
consistent
finish
tasty
o
i
expected
this
to
be
excellent
and
it
is
i
tend
to
prefer
my
weizens
to
have
a
lighter
malt
profile
but
the
fact
that
i
still
enjoyed
this
immensely
is
a
testament
to
its
quality
alltime
greatest
weizenbock
to
date
would
love
to
try
this
with
some
age
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
my
aventinus
eisbock
i
suggest
you
travel
down
this
path
4
5
maybe
the
best
weizenbock
available
out
there
it
has
an
exceptional
quaffable
quality
very
tasty
i
can
feel
no
harm
of
alcohol
during
drink
but
yes
its
still
there
lurking
notes
this
bottle
was
12
years
old
this
one
is
the
granddaddy
of
weizenbocks
and
it
richly
deserves
the
title
wow
this
is
an
amazing
beer
it
really
surprised
me
in
that
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
it
is
a
truly
refreshing
beer
wonderful
combination
of
flavors
going
on
ill
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
very
soon
overall
a
phenomenal
beer
for
a
cold
spring
night
would
pair
amazing
with
german
cuisine
ocomplex
yet
wellbalanced
example
of
the
style
poured
into
an
aventinus
glass
caramel
body
with
white
head
the
head
is
reflective
of
the
abv
compared
to
the
hefeweizen
head
i
get
load
of
clove
out
of
the
nose
a
slightly
spicy
clove
the
taste
is
loaded
with
banana
and
clove
theres
an
insane
balance
between
the
clove
and
banana
full
feeling
in
the
mouth
with
the
yeast
flavors
just
taking
over
in
the
best
way
possible
finishes
chewy
and
amazing
there
is
alot
going
on
in
this
beer
very
complex
layer
of
flavors
that
actually
go
together
very
well
this
is
a
hidden
gem
of
a
beer
if
youve
passed
this
up
pick
it
up
next
time
o
surprised
that
i
liked
this
one
so
much
its
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
with
pleasant
fruity
overtones
and
miles
of
bready
malts
absolutely
stunning
o
something
differentbut
not
my
taste
o
this
is
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
ive
had
it
features
all
of
the
expected
flavor
of
a
weizen
bock
and
has
incredible
balance
overall
a
will
be
back
o
really
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
quite
sessionable
even
at
the
abv
which
is
very
well
hidden
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
over
the
years
and
always
enjoyed
it
tonights
bottle
for
review
is
no
different
a
fantastic
beer
hides
its
abv
ridiculously
well
def
one
of
my
favourites
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
my
first
german
craft
beer
and
this
makes
me
want
to
try
all
the
other
styles
of
beer
from
germany
also
should
i
feel
bad
if
this
beer
reminds
me
of
rrs
damnation
23
easily
my
favorite
german
beer
i
never
had
it
fresh
while
overseas
but
even
the
old
bottles
sitting
around
the
shelves
here
top
everything
ive
had
so
far
i
dont
think
ive
ever
said
this
before
but
maybe
its
too
carbonated
pretty
prickly
for
a
doppelbock
however
that
subsides
to
a
mild
pricklyness
after
ten
minutes
medium
to
full
bodied
great
beer
if
i
feel
like
a
dark
german
lager
though
ill
turn
to
korbinian
o
what
a
beer
been
dying
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
and
it
certainly
did
not
disappoint
although
im
not
sure
if
this
is
better
than
vitus
its
damn
close
either
way
a
terrific
weizenbock
ive
had
the
eisbock
version
but
i
think
i
like
this
better
overall
this
is
spectacular
i
am
grateful
that
i
had
a
great
server
while
visiting
the
j
clyde
in
birmingham
al
who
turned
me
on
to
this
one
o
a
really
nice
drink
i
can
see
why
there
was
only
one
left
in
emart
o
wow
now
i
know
why
everyone
loves
this
beer
so
much
will
be
purchasing
this
again
for
sure
what
a
great
style
and
done
so
well
o
one
of
my
go
to
german
offerings
this
brew
brings
layers
of
complexity
that
makes
the
cold
days
a
little
warmer
pours
a
dark
murky
and
muddy
reddish
brown
with
a
2
finger
off
white
tight
bubbled
head
with
very
visible
carbonation
smells
of
deep
dark
fruits
cherry
wood
banana
like
yeast
characters
and
boozy
red
wine
finish
sour
fruit
hits
the
tongue
with
a
bold
cherries
grapes
raisins
and
figs
and
closes
with
a
boozy
spice
finish
medium
bodied
bold
and
smooth
velvety
on
the
tongue
overall
this
beer
is
great
and
always
at
a
fair
price
very
hard
to
pass
up
overall
impression
i
cant
believe
this
is
my
first
time
enjoying
this
one
awesome
the
prune
and
plum
character
was
unreal
in
here
will
be
buying
again
and
recommend
anyone
to
make
this
purchase
true
to
style
o
excellent
beer
very
malty
and
tons
of
fruit
almost
no
hops
or
bitterness
detected
very
deceptive
as
well
drinks
like
a
5
abv
o
definitely
a
great
beer
one
of
the
best
weizens
around
very
dangerously
drinkable
at
upwards
of
8
however
i
would
say
that
the
2006
definitely
is
a
better
vintage
to
be
enjoyed
at
this
point
in
time
2012
o
this
is
just
an
awesome
beer
i
have
been
waiting
a
while
to
get
this
and
now
i
really
regret
it
its
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
overall
totally
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
very
complex
tons
of
flavors
and
easy
to
drink
the
bittersour
fruit
kick
at
first
made
me
wonder
if
this
was
a
skunk
bottle
but
i
realized
this
beer
can
be
aged
for
many
years
it
took
me
half
the
bottle
before
i
fell
in
love
with
the
flavors
essential
beer
to
try
o
ill
admit
my
expectations
werent
tremendously
high
but
this
beer
exceeded
them
tastes
more
like
chimay
grande
reserve
than
a
wheat
beer
but
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
style
so
perhaps
thats
par
for
the
course
o
exceptional
beer
first
time
to
try
it
and
definitely
will
not
be
my
last
highly
recommend
if
you
are
a
wheat
beer
fan
very
easily
obtainable
in
fact
there
are
even
wrapped
2006
bottles
sitting
on
the
shelf
i
could
try
and
affordable
beer
im
happy
to
try
this
beer
and
would
surely
recommend
it
to
others
dark

in
color

roasted

and

malt
flavor
finished
cleanly
lot
of
flavors
and
a
wonderful
feel
overall
a
great
choice
for
getting
you
through
a
cold
dark
winter
day
i
have
not
had
too
many
of
this
style
probably
this
one
and
victorys
offering
this
one
seems
to
hit
all
the
style
points
quite
well
as
noted
a
substantial
and
nourishing
brew
im
a
big
fan
of
hefeweizens
but
not
too
crazy
about
this
one
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
in
the
beer
and
takes
away
from
the
delicious
fruitiness
of
the
complex
yeast
drinkability
is
lower
than
weissbier
due
to
the
high
alcohol
on
the
plus
the
darker
beer
brings
out
some
interesting
smells
and
tastes
of
dark
dried
fruit
that
you
dont
get
in
the
lighter
hefeweizen
despite
the
aforementioned
negatives
i
do
like
the
beer
just
not
something
i
would
get
very
often
just
too
boozy
a
weizen
for
the
colder
months
edit
ok
the
above
review
was
from
an
ontap
experience
two
days
ago
now
im
having
it
out
of
a
bottle
and
it
tastes
much
more
like
its
own
animal
than
like
a
dark
hoegaarden
still
some
of
that
wheaty
taste
but
not
nearly
as
pungently
hoegaardeny
tastes
more
like
its
own
thing
almost
like
they
aged
it
and
it
became
more
mature
and
some
more
sweet
notes
developed
i
actually
like
this
bottle
version
better
a
beer
i
have
had
tons
of
times
tonight
is
a
well
aged
bottle
from
a
case
i
must
of
bought
at
least
six
years
ago
a
lot
boozier
than
when
it
is
fresher
memories
of
having
this
fresh
at
there
gasthaus
in
munich
creeping
back
an
old
time
favourite
that
is
great
aged
or
fresh
and
the
measure
but
what
all
doppleweizen
bocks
should
be
measured
overall
i
am
really
surprised
by
how
good
this
is
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
style
ive
never
had
but
its
quite
tasty
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
eisbock
o
if
you
like
sweet
german
beers
with
lotsokick
this
is
your
beer
this
is
not
what
i
like
in
a
beer
on
my
first
trip
to
germany
my
first
beer
was
of
a
similar
style
which
left
me
wondering
what
all
the
german
bier
fuss
was
about
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
ruby
color
with
a
rapidly
fading
halfinch
head
and
lasting
lace
its
aroma
is
fruity
with
hints
of
plum
and
bread
the
flavor
is
fruity
mainly
dark
fruit
and
cherries
there
is
vanilla
and
sweet
dark
malt
with
a
pleasant
warmth
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
schneider
aventinus
is
and
outstanding
beer
well
balanced
complex
and
perfect
for
celebrating
the
new
year
highly
recommended
very
easy
drinking
m
thick
and
chewy
mouthfeel
sparkling
carbonation
that
compliments
the
zesty
wheat
character
well
o
one
of
the
truly
great
germans
right
up
my
alley
you
must
try
o
a
top
notch
brew
the
key
word
for
this
beer
is
depth
it
has
so
much
in
the
appearance
the
smell
and
the
taste
and
despite
all
that
it
has
a
refreshingly
light
mouthfeel
that
keeps
it
from
being
burdensome
or
weighty
a
very
impressive
beer
clearly
this
is
a
sipper
to
be
enjoyed
with
friends
if
you
drink
too
much
on
your
own
you
risk
losing
appreciation
of
the
beer
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
great
light
citrusy
but
full
flavored
ale
would
definitely
have
again
o
a
great
beer
that
must
be
tried
at
least
once
i
have
had
this
a
few
times
before
and
this
is
the
2nd
best
ive
had
it
best
was
on
tap
at
wurstkuche
in
la
in
the
proper
glass
worst
was
from
the
bottle
into
the
wrong
glass
at
home
the
glass
makes
a
big
difference
apparently
try
this
beer
at
least
once
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
tried
in
a
long
time
its
hard
to
find
a
flaw
in
this
one
complex
yet
very
approachable
and
delicious
o
a
classic
a
must
try
for
beer
lovers
everywhere
definitely
in
my
top
five
favorite
german
beers
this
is
a
very
good
beer
one
to
enjoy
with
a
good
meal
a
steak
dinner
actually
which
ill
be
enjoying
momentarily
one
of
my
favorite
wheat
beers
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
regardless
of
ingredients
overall
this
is
another
example
of
why
properly
cellaring
bottleconditioned
beers
is
a
great
idea
when
this
beer
is
fresh
i
find
the
yeast
flavors
to
be
too
dominant
with
way
too
much
clove
banana
and
spice
but
here
they
play
a
lesser
role
to
the
dark
fruitiness
and
the
caramelized
toasted
malts
really
well
worth
the
7
outlay
and
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
this
again
in
bulk
next
time
i
see
it
o
weizenbocks
are
not
what
i
normally
drink
which
is
why
i
rated
it
lower
than
a
weizenbock
drinker
would
have
it
is
worth
trying
if
you
want
to
try
different
beers
o
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
highly
rated
beer
great
flavor
profile
a
nice
beer
to
drink
over
the
course
of
an
evening
as
i
did
look
forward
to
trying
a
few
more
in
this
style
pours
the
color
of
a
strong
cup
of
tea
with
a
twofinger
head
the
bubbles
turn
more
into
a
nice
froth
on
the
top
once
the
initial
pour
dies
down
smells
of
muted
dark
fruits
cloves
and
a
light
winey
character
the
taste
is
round
and
very
smooth
the
dark
fruits
and
cloves
dominate
but
are
all
slightly
rounded
and
nothing
seems
to
overpower
the
rest
great
depth
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
dry
finish
all
this
without
tiring
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
very
nice
this
is
a
great
beer
the
alcohol
is
hidden
and
no
doubt
this
is
a
well
made
beer
overall
add
to
that
the
fact
its
widely
available
and
reasonable
priced
make
me
think
this
will
be
added
to
the
lineup
often
a
local
shop
has
some
2004s
wrapped
in
paper
that
i
think
ill
have
to
grab
just
to
see
what
this
thing
does
with
some
age
i
have
a
harder
time
describing
wheat
beers
i
will
keep
reading
reviews
to
get
a
better
hold
of
it
o
a
very
very
good
weizenbock
classic
flavors
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
but
it
is
still
fantastic
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
taste
great
goes
down
great
and
leaves
you
wanting
another
o
a
pretty
fantastic
beer
tons
of
depth
and
richness
stylewise
i
doubt
youre
going
to
find
anything
better
seems
especially
well
suited
to
cold
fall
nights
should
be
on
every
beer
geeks
must
try
list
this
is
just
amazing
stuff
tons
of
variety
both
in
the
aroma
and
flavour
together
with
an
unbeatably
smooth
feel
make
this
one
of
the
most
satisfying
brews
ive
ever
had
i
think
i
would
still
prefer
the
much
lighter
schneiderweisse
on
most
occasions
but
the
alcohol
in
this
stuff
is
wellhidden
which
makes
it
much
more
suited
as
a
slow
winter
sipper
edit
and
slow
is
not
an
exaggeration
i
am
still
drinking
this
an
hour
after
finishing
the
review
i
will
definitely
purchase
this
again
at
some
point
overall
its
tasty
but
the
booze
is
a
bit
more
present
than
it
would
need
to
be
strictly
speaking
also
while
the
flavors
here
are
nice
theres
not
a
ton
of
depth
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
just
not
what
i
expected
based
on
the
reviews
but
then
again
i
dont
really
know
how
old
this
is
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
its
solidly
built
beautiful
to
look
at
and
both
feels
and
tastes
great
i
would
highly
recommend
it
o
nice
complex
taste
lots
of
flavor
but
not
wearying
on
palate
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
above
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
nice
bite
in
the
tongue
goes
down
pretty
easily
even
with
the
alcohol
overall
a
great
brew
it
all
goes
together
so
well
and
the
sweetness
balanced
with
the
spices
is
a
great
combination
o
good
beer
if
your
in
the
mood
for
clove
o
wow
this
beer
was
a
treat
i
will
be
going
back
to
this
beer
again
and
again
the
beer
hits
it
at
almost
all
levels
o
this
is
easily
the
best
weiznbock
in
the
world
weinhestephaners
comes
close
but
this
one
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
schneider
son
is
da
bomb
poured
a
rich
deep
ruddy
brown
with
great
white
head
head
lingers
a
very
long
time
it
laces
the
glass
well
scent
of
raisinscaramel
biscuits
it
has
a
feel
of
bright
carbonation
taste
is
indescribably
complex
and
delicious
a
relativly
high
a
b
v
is
absolutely
not
apparent
so
be
careful
with
this
one
o
there
arent
enough
words
that
i
can
use
to
describe
the
quality
and
awesomeness
of
this
beer
from
the
beautiful
presentation
to
the
inviting
and
seducing
aroma
to
the
balanced
and
rich
taste
to
the
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
this
beer
demonstrates
how
it
should
be
done
and
sets
the
bar
up
until
now
i
considered
the
weihenstephaner
vitus
as
one
of
the
best
beers
and
the
best
in
its
style
but
this
one
takes
the
spot
too
bad
this
brew
is
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
i
will
definitely
go
back
for
more
every
now
and
then
a
must
try
for
any
beer
lover
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
its
8
alcohol
is
completely
masked
it
is
very
drinkable
and
seems
to
gain
in
complexity
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
this
really
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
however
i
can
appreciate
a
high
quality
brew
when
i
taste
one
even
if
it
is
not
quite
my
bag
o
overall
a
rather
well
rounded
out
beer
tasty
and
you
can
tell
that
the
people
who
made
this
know
what
they
were
doing
thick
sweet
malty
goodness
the
foam
is
similar
to
the
foam
in
an
ice
cream
float
the
beer
looks
cloudy
like
it
might
have
a
lot
of
suspended
sediment
but
it
is
quite
pure
it
tastes
and
smells
of
grain
and
toffee
if
light
wheat
beers
were
skim
milk
aventinus
would
be
a
milkshake
delicious
hefty
and
yet
somehow
refreshing
even
at
8
2
alcohol
a
better
weizenbock
than
this
you
will
not
find
after
finishing
the
bottle
i
noticed
the
upfront
sweetness
of
the
beer
starts
to
build
and
kit
gets
sweeter
as
you
sip
not
something
i
enjoyed
highly
recommended
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
reviewed
here
from
notes
from
bottle
tasting
though
i
have
enjoyed
ontap
as
well
poured
from
bottle
into
aventinus
tall
glass
a
wonderful
caramel
color
with
a
good
amount
of
dense
tightly
condensed
head
of
effervescent
bubbles
taste
of
malt
and
a
very
floral
and
carbonated
burst
of
flavors
all
at
once
with
a
smack
of
warmth
from
the
alcohol
but
remarkably
smooth
and
totally
drinkable
which
can
be
a
dangerous
combo
as
i
have
had
more
then
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
and
found
myself
feeling
no
pain
good
good
stuff
that
i
could
drink
anytime
and
need
to
keep
on
hand
more
as
my
glass
gets
lonely
for
this
dark
amber
colored
devil
oi
wont
look
for
this
one
again
simply
because
im
not
a
fan
of
the
clove
taste
but
it
is
a
fairly
complex
beer
like
i
said
this
is
the
best
and
most
complex
example
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
and
the
one
that
measure
all
others
against
simply
classic
very
complex
very
enjoyable
to
drink
overall
this
is
just
a
wonderful
special
beer
i
would
love
to
get
this
fresh
on
tap
some
day
o
a
very
nice
beer
o
very
very
interesting
complex
beer
i
dont
think
my
tongue
is
sophisticated
enough
to
describe
this
properly
but
boy
this
is
good
o
you
cant
go
wrong
alcohol
is
masterfully
masked
who
doesnt
like
banana
flavor
in
an
autumn
beer
im
not
a
huge
german
beer
fan
but
this
lives
up
to
the
hype
o
tasty
stuff
and
well
balanced
and
integrated
just
what
i
would
expect
from
a
german
classic
brew
make
sure
you
pour
all
of
the
yeast
into
the
glass
the
yeast
is
the
soul
of
this
beer
o
i
am
very
on
the
fence
about
this
beer
i
like
it
but
i
dont
think
its
great
great
nose
sure
but
the
taste
is
only
good
i
think
ill
try
to
find
something
more
recent
and
give
it
another
go
d
the
booze
catches
up
with
you
but
is
definitely
not
the
focal
point
great
complexity
on
the
palate
couldnt
get
as
much
on
the
nose
and
a
slightly
lacking
carbonation
are
my
only
nitpicky
complaints
otherwise
solid
overall
an
epic
beer
a
definite
treat
a
fine
brew
very
interesting
anyway
you
look
at
it
even
more
important
it
tastes
and
smells
great
o
i
wish
there
were
more
doppelbocks
like
this
very
true
to
style
and
very
true
to
its
composition
i
find
many
doppelbocks
too
heavy
lacking
finesse
or
on
the
other
hand
too
far
crafted
into
a
malty
wheat
that
it
becomes
a
bad
spinoff
this
is
a
pinnacle
of
style
that
reminds
us
of
the
spectrum
big
beers
have
to
offer
i
have
been
very
happy
with
g
schneider
sohns
other
offerings
and
this
beer
is
just
a
nice
it
was
surprisingly
smooth
at
8
2
alcohol
i
expected
more
of
a
punch
from
something
with
that
high
abv
initially
it
smelled
and
tasted
a
bit
boozy
it
does
little
to
hide
the
8
2
i
assume
the
bottle
i
bought
was
neither
too
old
nor
too
fresh
overall
it
is
a
nice
experience
and
it
would
be
ok
to
buy
it
again
but
i
wont
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
there
are
a
lot
of
other
german
beers
that
i
prefer
pours
a
dark
brown
w
a
slight
crimson
tinge
if
held
up
to
the
light
nice
two
finger
cocoa
head
that
lingers
for
a
bit
good
carbonation
and
decent
lacing
nose
is
that
of
caramel
apple
pear
malt
spices
nose
isnt
as
strong
as
id
like
but
its
still
pleasant
taste
is
the
same
profile
as
the
nose
w
noticeable
carbonation
goes
down
pretty
smooth
w
big
maltfruit
feel
to
the
beer
fairly
dry
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
really
dry
but
not
bad
this
is
a
really
nice
tasting
brew
o
hugein
terms
of
numbersflavor
profile
going
on
here
very
complex
yet
very
balanced
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
daily
but
agian
proving
the
germans
are
tough
to
beat
o
a
great
beer
with
strong
fruit
nodes
a
minor
bitter
finish
that
is
substantially
overwhelmed
by
fruit
nodes
from
the
bottle
marked
10
31506852822
sampled
on
august
11
2011
it
pours
into
the
dopplebock
glass
an
attractive
looking
dark
amber
with
hints
of
ruby
red
and
a
significant
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
eventually
settles
to
a
ring
there
are
plenty
of
wheat
and
sweet
malts
on
the
nose
with
a
minor
whiff
of
hops
but
no
alcohol
given
its
8
2
abv
at
first
the
body
felt
bold
but
then
it
seemed
to
feel
thinner
more
like
the
texture
of
red
wine
a
beautiful
balance
of
sweet
caramel
malts
and
wheat
grab
the
tastebuds
up
front
which
are
quickly
followed
by
a
solid
sting
of
dry
hops
and
a
battery
of
spices
nice
beer
o
this
is
one
awesome
beer
and
it
deserves
all
the
acclaim
it
gets
it
has
a
ton
of
flavor
without
getting
to
the
point
of
being
overpowering
if
you
have
the
chance
to
try
this
one
you
really
should
ill
definitely
pick
this
up
the
next
time
im
out
o
good
but
not
my
style
d
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
there
are
a
lot
of
different
flavors
present
yeast
banana
bread
spice
and
they
all
blend
nicely
into
each
other
a
solid
beer
overall
ein
wunderbar
bier
naturlich
overall
you
really
cant
tell
its
an
8
5er
i
staring
at
my
empty
glass
which
happened
quicker
than
i
originally
thought
it
would
here
i
sit
wishing
i
would
have
bought
a
second
bottle
i
figured
being
an
8
5er
this
would
take
me
longer
to
finish
but
i
couldnt
wait
until
the
next
sip
so
it
went
down
with
ease
this
is
an
outstanding
weizenbock
beer
too
bad
i
cant
find
it
around
in
a
16
keg
i
would
easily
invest
the
money
in
this
one
for
now
the
16
9
oz
bottle
will
have
to
do
which
for
around
4
00
a
bottle
its
money
well
spent
easily
makes
my
top
ten
readily
available
beers
0
wheat
beers
have
the
shortest
of
shelflives
after
horforward
beers
like
ipas
so
im
hoping
although
this
one
exceeds
8abv
that
this
example
sits
post
its
prime
it
just
fails
to
impress
me
the
flavor
is
there
but
nothing
exceptional
pops
out
o
great
weizenbock
might
be
the
best
ive
had
for
sure
the
smoothest
pours
a
cloudy
dark
tea

a

pricey
though
o
the
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
especially
at
over
8
abv
really
i
think
this
beer
is
an
awesome
treat
a
must
have
and
repeat
odthe
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
especially
at
over
8
abv
i
must
say
that
i
enjoy
the
weizenbock
over
the
traditional
hefeweizen
i
enjoy
the
darker
malts
this
beer
is
pretty
neat
and
everyone
should
try
this
i
drank
this
too
quickly
lively
and
prickly
with
carbonation
yet
silky
smooth
at
the
same
time
bubblegum
transitions
to
juicy
citrus
which
ushers
in
assorted
baked
fruits
add
a
dash
of
cloves
and
the
mix
brings
to
mind
a
nice
cobbler
banana
bread
rumcake
warming
alcohol
in
the
finish
wonderfully
complex
if
youre
looking
for
a
measuring
stick
for
the
weizenbock
style
this
would
be
a
good
place
to
start
great
beer
narrative
gretchen
dulcebergs
candy
business
was
in
dire
straights
for
starters
opening
a
confectionary
boutique
in
rural
utah
was
bound
to
cause
some
problems
with
the
mormon
populace
second
the
recession
hit
the
gourmet
fusion
sweets
market
especially
hard
the
average
blonde
haired
blue

utahite
would
saunter
in
with
a
sweet
tooth
for
a
simple
snickers
or
a
chicostick
and
be
welcomed
with
truffled
cocoa
with
dried
ahi
tuna
or
muddled
marshmellow
foam
imbued
with
beef
stock
marrow
the
price
of
gretchens
goods
would
leave
a
sour
taste
in
the
mouth
of
the
most
proper
latter
day
saint
ultimately
ms
dulcebergs
sweet
tooth
was
too
obtuse
for
the
average
mormon
but
in
dresden
this
place
would
have
been
a
dunklesmash
pours
a
murky
iced
tea
color
with
a
2
inch
light
bone
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
small
swatches
of
lace
drip
back
down
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
dark
fruits
and
spices
taste
is
of
clovespices
wheat
and
dark
fruits
there
are
some
slight
vanilla
and
chocolate
flavors
too
this
beer
has
a
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
the
first
of
the
style
i
have
had
i
would
get
this
one
again
o
ok
so
still
an
awesome
beer
but
not
the
bite
you
get
from
a
fresh
one
thoughts
of
mild
belgian
dubbels
and
dark
ales
coming
to
mind
well
now
i
have
a
finger
of
lighttan
head
with
decent
retention
in
light
of
the
heat
and
humidity
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
deep
amber
nose
smelled
heavily
of
red
grapes
like
a
preparation
for
wine
and
now
i
was
shaking
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
the
nose
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
this
was
a
semisweet
beer
with
an
alcohol
content
that
would
put
any
of
us
on
the
road
to
perdition
finish
was
deadly
smooth
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
felt
the
urge
to
operate
heavy
machinery
this
may
be
the
devils
work
one
of
the
most
famous
weizenbocks
doesnt
disappoint
complex
but
superdrinkable
a
must
have
beer
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
really
muddy
looking
brown
color
with
a
big
fluffy
tan
colored
head
the
lacing
looked
promising
and
stuck
around
for
most
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
really
nice
had
some
soft
wheat
aromas
mixed
with
some
dark
fruits
and
some
spice
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
really
great
too
the
flavors
of
clove
and
banana
sweet
dried
dark
fruits
and
a
nice
wheat
backbone
the
beer
is
pretty
light
feeling
despite
the
color
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
to
enjoy
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
what
a
nice
surprise
here
cant
wait
to
drink
it
again
o
overall
i
was
pretty
disappointed
it
certainly
wasnt
bad
but
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
i
did
however
make
the
mistake
of
trying
the
aventinus
eisbock
before
i
had
this
the
eisbock
is
fantastic
and
this
just
seems
like
a
version
that
was
way
too
watered
down
which
i
guess
technically
speaking
it
is
a
watered
down
eisbock
and
overly
carbonated
i
dont
see
myself
trying
this
again
its
just
too
light
for
my
palate
the
eisbock
however
now
theres
a
beer
i
cant
wait
to
have
again
o
a
very
good
beer
would
drink
again
delicious
and
complex
one
of
my
favorites
500ml
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
earthy
brown
color
with
very
little
head
aroma
of
clove
banana
yeast
earthiness
and
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
spices
banana
sweet
grains
and
breadiness
has
a
bit
of
that
banana
bread
flavor
boozey
taste
is
present
but
not
too
overwhelming
this
one
reaches
a
nice
balance
of
flavor
while
not
having
too
much
spice
flavor
to
it
overall
its
not
a
style
i
often
have
but
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
weizenbocks
out
there
worth
grabbing
for
sure
o
there
are
no
complaints
here
aventinus
is
complex
but
immediately
enjoyable
this
is
a
beer
that
can
change
perception
and
change
minds
on
a
style
or
a
brewing
tradition
it
has
mine
this
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
brown
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
lasting
off
white
head
the
smell
is
yeasty
slightly
spicey
like
clove
and
banana
but
much
lighter
than
in
most
hefeweisen
the
flavor
is
mirrors
the
smell
almost
perfectly
but
it
has
a
hint
of
a
slightly
metallic
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nearly
perfect
a
nice
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
this
beer
could
be
a
little
better
the
metallic
flavor
and
maybe
a
little
bit
fuler
body
but
it
is
excellent
o
the
first
time
ive
tried
this
beer
and
i
can
easily
say
this
is
a
great
beer
ive
seen
a
vintage
bottle
which
i
may
try
and
pick
up
to
do
a
side
by
side
overall
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
there
are
so
many
flavors
and
the
spices
really
balance
each
other
out
its
so
easy
to
drink
and
so
refreshing
there
are
so
many
flavors
that
hit
my
palate
at
once
that
it
is
just
difficult
to
dissect
all
at
once
i
dont
drink
many
german
beers
but
this
has
opened
the
door
for
me
give
it
a
shot
its
great
a
dry
finish
that
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
ill
be
stocking
up
on
this
in
the
future
i
wish
i
could
taste
this
on
draft
i
cant
imagine
a
robust
yet
smooth
fullbodied
bock
that
truly
deserves
its
reputation
as
one
of
the
worlds
best
beers
aventinus
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
color
and
there
are
notes
of
sweet
malt
and
spices
in
the
nose
the
sweet
malt
and
spices
jump
out
in
the
taste
as
well
complimented
by
hints
of
banana
dark
chocolate
vanilla
and
wheat
with
light
floral
hops
at
the
finish
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
aventinus
and
the
sweet
candy
backbone
makes
it
a
truly
enjoyable
bock
overall
not
an
a
but
a
very
unique
beer
a
nicely
done
beer
and
so
easy
to
drink
that
it
makes
it
a
dangerous
beer
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
finally
decided
to
glad
i
did
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
with
a
decently
unique
flavor
combination
well
worth
trying
o
its
a
good
beer
but
not
really
for
me
drink
up
ifn
you
like
big
honkin
wheat
beer
jd
man
i
think
the
first
time
i
tasted
this
beer
it
was
a
bad
bottle
because
this
one
was
fantastic
it
still
smelled
musty
kind
of
like
old
wine
cave
it
tasted
like
a
wine
ale
mixed
with
a
quadrupel
very
good
beer
im
glad
i
tasted
it
again
to
sum
up
the
king
of
weissbiers
pours
a
very
murky
dirty
brown
fig
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
scent
is
spicy
and
wheatlike
tons
of
wheat
and
clove
with
some
banana
and
dark
fruit
taste
is
just
like
it
smells
tons
of
dark
fruit
with
the
distinct
characteristics
of
a
wellcrafted
hef
there
are
such
lovely
clove
and
wheat
flavors
mixed
with
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
cocoa
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
flavor
but
finishes
very
spicy
and
crisp
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
crisp
amazing
flavor
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
beer
is
outstanding
o
very
nice
4
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
definitely
my
favorite
german
beer
that
i
have
sampled
very
cheap
price
at
3
for
a
500
ml
bottle
in
alberta
which
is
a
awesome
price
o
good
but
not
special
i
wouldnt
put
this
with
the
best
of
the
doppels
one
of
my
favorite
german
beers
i
have
had
so
far
goes
done
super
easy
especially
when
considering
the
abv
it
gives
a
nice
array
of
flavors
but
doesnt
feel
overdone
in
any
way
drink
easy
to
take
this
one
down
alot
my
glass
was
empty
before
i
knew
it
ill
always
come
back
to
this
one
one
of
the
best
3
80
a
single
of
which
ill
easily
get
again
overall
german
style
beers
are
really
starting
to
grow
on
me
this
is
an
excellent
brew
with
a
very
interesting
and
complex
flavour
it
has
all
the
qualities
that
a
german
wheat
beer
should
have
with
the
big
malty
profile
of
a
bock
sweet
tart
and
satisfying
overall
like
it
not
familiar
with
the
style
and
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
prefer
a
usual
weissbier
but
this
left
me
satisfied
robust
carbonation
scrubbed
the
tongue
it
was
very
drinkable
and
didnt
seem
like
8
2
abv
this
is
a
remarkable
beer
at
5
50
for
500ml
its
not
an
everyday
beer
but
its
certainly
a
delicious
treat
o
really
great
beer
alcohol
is
present
without
overwhelming
taste
aroma
and
looks
are
all
well
balanced
and
it
is
nice
and
complex
i
hope
i
can
start
finding
this
more
often
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
it
tastes
good
and
goes
down
easily
plus
at
4
00
a
bottle
a
good
value
for
such
a
great
beer
i
sure
this
will
be
a
staple
for
me
and
always
have
a
spot
in
my
fridge
overallgreat
flavors
unbelieve
flavors
and
aroma
will
be
drinking
this
beer
again
soon
overall
fantastic
completely
deserving
of
its
high
rank
on
the
top
100
german
brews
i
would
gladly
go
for
another
if
i
had
bought
more
pours
an
opaque
hazy
brown
ruby
in
the
light
nice
white
head
nice
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
is
of
yeasty
bread
dark
fruit
raisin
banana
some
sweetness
clove
and
light
alcohol
taste
is
of
banana
yeast
clove
spice
slight
alcohol
dark
fruit
in
the
finish
medium
weight
good
feel
quite
refreshing
and
lightly
syrupy
at
points
outstanding
stuff
world
class
and
at
2
75
this
is
a
steal
t
really
smooth
and
really
delicious
banana
bread
and
sweet
malts
all
over
the
taste
with
some
clove
and
spiciness
towards
the
finish
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
of
a
warming
sensation
lets
you
know
its
not
one
to
be
taken
lightly
i
really
like
this
one
overall
buy
this
one
cross
statelines
to
find
it
if
you
have
to
this
will
be
in
my
fridge
almost
constantly
at
3
99
for
a
500
ml
bottle
it
is
a
great
buy
overall
very
good
beer
the
balance
of
flavors
and
aromas
are
perfection
for
the
style
it
was
surprisingly
refreshing
but
the
abv
reminds
you
at
the
end
that
this
is
not
a
summer
easy
quaffing
drink
pinnacle
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
what
a
great
job
and
a
must
try
beer
one
excellent
wheat
beer
not
only
is
it
flavorful
but
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
can
be
rare
so
dont
pass
up
an
opportunity
to
try
this
o
fantastic
i
love
it
could
drink
this
on
a
hot
summer
night
or
a
cold
winter
night
i
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
before
i
make
pulled
pork
tomorrow
o
the
balance
of
this
beer
is
really
impressive
this
beer
has
a
rich
taste
with
dark
fruits
bananas
and
clove
that
all
play
gracefully
over
your
palate
just
long
enough
to
keep
you
wanting
more
without
overstaying
their
welcome
and
overpowering
you
this
beer
is
excellent
and
dangerously
drinkable
at
8
2
overall
this
is
simply
an
uppereschelon
german
brew
not
a
style
i
personally
tend
to
gravitate
toward
but
this
one
is
very
good
not
to
be
missed
o
a
very
wellcrafted
beer
i
never
thought
id
be
fond
of
really
yeasty
brew
but
this
is
a
thing
of
beauty
overall
a
nice
and
sweet
sipper
that
is
very
complex
i
could
have
this
a
couple
nights
in
a
row
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
style
aroma
is
of
yeast
banana
cloves
cinnamon
wheat
and
brown
sugar
full
slightly
crisp
body
wheat
malt
spices
banana
some
apple
and
some
alcohol
fill
the
palate
long
pleasant
semidry
finish
wonderful
brew
i
could
drink
it
a
whole
day
o
first
german
beer
i
have
truly
enjoyed
picked
it
up
at
the
local
lcbo
no
idea
if
it
was
any
good
but
thought
i
would
give
it
a
chance
boy
what
a
choice
it
is
reasonably
priced
and
now
firmly
embedded
in
my
top
10
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
im
sitting
on
my
patio
with
the
grill
lit
and
enjoying
the
weather
sure
i
would
be
lovin
life
with
out
this
beer
but
it
is
the
perfect
addition
to
enhance
my
experience
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
plan
on
getting
some
more
overall
the
beer
was
excellent
a
great
experience
if
you
havent
tried
it
get
of
your
butt
o
great
tasting
solid
all
around
beer
very
drinkable
for
its
8
2
abv
overall
theres
a
reason
this
beer
sits
at
the
top
of
the
weizenbock
ranking
it
is
a
really
good
tasty
beer
it
has
very
good
flavors
bananas
cloves
and
dark
fruits
all
make
their
presence
known
during
the
drinking
of
this
one
this
beer
reminds
me
of
october
and
i
feel
it
would
pair
excellently
with
pumpkin
pie
the
yeast
is
the
star
here
but
the
malt
isnt
far
behind
overall
a
great
tasting
mix
of
fruits
and
spices
goes
down
pretty
smooth
with
no
sign
of
the
high
alcohol
overall
i
am
extremely
pleased
i
bought
this
beer
it
was
kind
of
like
a
blind
date
because
i
knew
nothing
about
the
beer
before
purchasing
it
and
i
was
nervous
about
the
possibility
of
choosing
a
bad
beer
on
a
otherwise
crappy
night
put
this
on
my
list
of
favorite
beers
check
well
back
to
packing
my
junk
up
for
now
cheers
pretty
nice
frankly
i
like
the
eisbock
version
a
lot
more
we
hear
a
lot
about
this
one
and
its
very
good
but
thats
the
gem
of
the
line
a
fine
beer
opens
with
suggestions
of
prunes
and
raisins
followed
by
flavors
of
banana
cloves
allspice
and
candied
malts
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
hints
of
peach
and
vanilla
surface
before
returning
to
brown
sugar
and
spice
complex
malt
character
with
the
soul
of
a
dessert
bread
abv
is
well
concealed
finishes
with
a
smack
of
wheat
overall
a
good
beer
how
it
garnered
such
a
high
rating
on
here
is
beyond
me
i
drank
a
simple
hefe
before
this
and
it
was
much
better
i
cant
get
past
the
alcohol
character
i
dont
mind
it
but
this
tastes
more
like
a
shitty
russian
baltika
than
something
that
would
come
out
of
the
beer
mecca
bavaria
serving
22
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
i
really
want
to
score
this
higher
but
i
cant
think
of
a
reason
to
do
so
a
very
exceptional
beer
pours
to
form
a
thick
creamy
head
this
beer
has
the
sweet
flavor
and
smell
of
ripe
bananas
at
first
with
a
satisfying
alcohol
finish
the
color
is
an
opaque
amberbrown
as
the
beer
warms
ups
and
the
head
dies
down
the
flavor
and
aroma
become
even
more
robust
i
had
this
with

food
boiled

etc
it
enhanced
the
meal

a
small
bite
and
medium
to
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
banana
peel
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
hides
the
alcohol
big
dry
fruit
and
so
tasty
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
nice
flavors
and
solid
mouthfeel
overall
not
for
me
but
i
will
give
it
another
shot
to
make
sure
i
didnt
have
a
bad
bottle
or
was
just
having
an
off
day
the
fluffy
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
certainly
makes
it
very
drinkable
but
i
would
have
preferred
less
carbonation
to
allow
the
great
flavors
to
stick
to
my
tongue
a
little
better
overall
is
beer
is
incredible
and
held
up
amazingly
for
being
brewed
8
years
ago
muddy

awesomely
easy

i
was
shocked
when
i
opened
up
the
ba
page
and
saw
the
reviews
for
this
one
i
have
never
been
this
far
below
the
average
but
i
just
did
not
like
this
beer
at
all
o
some
beers
i
have
had
in
the
past
tend
to
get
better
as
they
get
closer
to
the
bottom
i
poured
out
the
first
half
of
the
beer
and
poured
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
no
such
luck
just
as
unpleasant
as
the
first
half
could
not
finish
this
one
this
is
a
really
outstanding
beer
that
i
have
enjoyed
many
times
and
it
is
consistently
excellent
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
with
a
nice
1
finger
head
that
lasts
the
beer
smells
spicy
and
exotic
kind
of
like
a
christmas
ale
tastes
of
malt
and
spice
warms
you
up
as
it
goes
down
but
not
too
much
has
a
nice
alcohol
balance
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
go
to
beers
that
ill
drink
anytime
of
year
if
you
have
not
had
it
you
have
to
try
it
2003
bottle

clear
dark

aroma
is
clove
sherry
wheat
and
caramel
medium
mouthfeel
flavors
follow
the
nose
this
has
a
great
sherry
like
flavor
nutty
almost
roasty
and
is
an
overall
great
experience
a
damn
fine
brew
awesome
beer
i
am
becoming
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
and
this
is
exceptional
it
pours
a
cloudy
brown
and
the
smell
of
bananas
and
cloves
is
very
strong
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
fans
of
this
style
very
easy
drinking
refreshing
spring
or
summer
beer
pours
a
deep
reddishmahogany
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
and
smells
rich
and
ripe
with
a
darkrum
like
character
and
notes
of
caramel
green
apple
and
vanilla
joining
the
wheatinfluenced
banana
bread
flavor
the
palate
is
pillowy
and
full
bodied
beginning
with
a
vast
spreading
blast
of
carbonation
which
settles
into
the
caramel
and
apricot
flavors
with
a
touch
of
floral
bitterness
the
long
finish
starts
sweet
and
rich
with
cooked
fruit
notes
before
turning
mouthwateringly
tart
i
absolutely
loved
the
whole
lipsmacking
delivery
on
this
by
using
wheat
this
managed
to
stay
incredibly
elegant
too
instead
of
succumbing
to
a
boggeddown
syrupy
malt
character
probably
my
fav
reviewed
beer
at
the
moment
a
light
spicy
aroma
with
some
banana
and
malt
overtones
color
is
an
opaque
brownish
dark
amber
with
bubbly
off
white
head
that
starts
tall
and
slowly
dissapears
with
no
retention
taste
is
lightly
sweet
and
bitter
and
a
nice
creamy
medium
body
lively
carbonation
as
bubbles
arise
for
quite
a
long
time
finish
has
a
definite
alchohol
note
i
definitely
like
this
beer
but
may
not
be
my
favorite
in
this
category
d
good
sipping
beer
which
leaves
you
with
a
satisfied
alcohol
related
warmth
o
really
interesting
to
see
how
it
held
up
over
8
years
id
say
pretty
well
4
md
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
the
carbonation
that
created
such
a
huge
head
is
gentle
and
smooth
throughout
alcohol
is
almost
not
apparent
at
all
there
is
a
reason
this
beer
has
such
good
ratings
wow
am
i
off
the
average
ba
review
on
this
one
it
looks
good
cloudy
hazy
dark
brown
it
smells
like
clove
bananas
malt
the
taste
is
ok
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
im
disappointed
because
the
bottle
says
that
there
should
be
some
chocolate
notes
but
all
im
getting
is
the
spicy
clove
and
banana
now
i
like
bananas
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
taste
for
a
beer
i
like
the
other
offering
from
this
brewery
much
better
oh
well
at
least
it
gave
me
a
pleasant
buzz
d
dangerously
drinkable
at
over
8
abv
the
complex
flavor
and
aroma
will
beckon
for
further
sipping
and
im
almost
certain
aventinus
would
make
a
fine
pairing
with
many
roast
pork
or
cheese
plates
excellent
flavors
and
craftsmanship
make
it
a
nobrainer
when
in
the
market
for
complex
german
brews
dcould
handle
2
very
enjoyable
sipper
poured
a
medium
hazy
brown
with
a
very
large
offwhite
fizzy
head
that
dissapated
rapidly
and
had
no
poor
lacing
the
aroma
was
complex
with
a
dark
chocolate
malt
and
a
sweet
earthy
yeast
that
had
notes
of
clove
banana
vanilla
and
a
mild
alcohol
scent
it
tasted
sweet
and
acidic
with
a
mild
hint
of
banana
and
chocolate
in
the
begining
and
the
become
mildly
sweet
with
a
yeastysour
flavor
that
had
a
nice
spiciness
at
the
finish
with
the
flavor
lasting
only
a
short
time
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
with
a
lively
carbonation
overall
an
awesome
wheatbock
beer
in
fact
i
think
i
will
just
have
to
drink
another
could
maybe
up
the
bubbles
not
flat
but
could
use
a
little
kick
up
after
just
a
few
mouthfuls
i
can
feel
the
alcohol
bearing
down
on
me
which
is
fair
enough
at
8
2
though
i
feel
like
its
still
hitting
me
very
fast
that
being
said
id
have
another
the
fact
is
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
i
wouldnt
possibly
pass
up
at
a
liquor
store
if
i
could
get
it
in
my
area
it
exemplifies
great
beer
that
toes
the
line
of
the
dark
beer
category
the
taste
is
extremely
rich
it
has
dark
malts
and
fruity
after
thoughts
an
interesting
combo
and
a
nice
sipper
body
is
rich
and
velvety
but
not
creamy
or
thick
this
is
just
perfect
for
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
here
and
better
than
any
other
beer
ive
had
of
this
style
the
high
alcohol
content
make
it
something
that
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
handle
every
day
but
its
a
very
nice
slow
sipper
d
a
great
beer
even
if
my
enjoyment
of
the
sweet
flavor
did
diminish
a
bit
by
the
end
of
my
glass
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
as
my
first
weizenbock
i
might
have
guessed
this
was
a
belgian
beer
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
coming
in
while
i
havent
had
any
others
this
is
highly
recommended
for
newcomers
to
the
style
d
very
drinkable
and
delicious
beer
that
is
both
refreshing
and
filling
d
this
is
probably
the
best
wheat
beer
andor
doppelbock
ive
had
its
nearly
perfect
despite
the
amazingly
fullcomplex
flavor
and
luscious
mouthfeel
it
still
has
a
light
and
airy
quality
to
it
that
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
and
i
completely
dont
sense
the
8
2
alcohol
d
this
is
the
weizenbock
in
my
book
there
are
plenty
of
tasty
examples
out
there
but
they
hardly
compare
to
the
aventinus
this
is
a
must
try
i
know
some
folks
are
not
big
fans
of
the
wheat
beers
but
his
stands
up
to
any
ipa
barleywine
stout
belgian
etc
out
there
this
would
make
the
finalist
list
for
best
in
show
just
sayin
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
keep
trying
these
highly
rated
overseas
beers
that
i
can
get
my
hand
on
and
they
never
seem
to
disappoint
i
guess
1700ish
reviews
to
an
a
is
no
joke
at
4
00
for
500ml
ill
definitely
be
purchasing
again
only
faults
were
for
the
head
that
disappears
quickly
and
the
week
overall
smell
its
medium
in
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
sort
of
grainy
mouthfeel
i
am
liking
the
aventinus
and
i
think
this
will
age
well
much
more
interesting
than
a
normal
bock
but
its
definitely
feeling
like
more
of
a
wintertime
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
eisbock
version
i
would
describe
this
as
drinkable
and
it
is
a
very
good
offering
for
the
style
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
poured
into
an
aventinus
doppelbock
glass
big
foamy
head
with
slight
tan
hue
thick
murky
brown
hazy
with
the
yeast
added
in
the
aroma
is
pumpernickel
bread
little
banana
bread
and
yeast
the
taste
is
the
aromas
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
cloyiness
the
body
is
filling
and
after
one
bottle
i
am
done
for
the
night
a
great
example
of
the
style
a
wonderful
beer
the
bottle
version
was
maybe
a
bit
lifeless
if
compared
with
the
ontap
version
but
im
not
sure
wheter
ratings
would
actually
change
d
i
liked
this
beer
good
flavors
and
good
mouthfeel
could
definitely
use
work
on
head
retention
and
lacing
though
that
was
a
bit
disappointing
my
only
gripe
is
the
appearance
cant
get
any
sort
of
head
out
of
it
a
minor
shortcoming
d
very
drinkable
however
i
think
2
would
be
the
maximum
if
you
define
drinkable
as
hey
i
want
one
again
its
a
5
if
you
define
it
as
i
want
to
pull
a
5
beer
session
that
this
is
not
that
kind
of
beer
unless
you
are
in
southern
germany
it
is
on
tap
served
by
a
beautiful
teutonic
waitress
and
your
friends
can
carry
you
out
this
is
a
world
class
beer
nd
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
at
a
price
of
4
for
a
500
ml
bottle
another
little
guy
that
i
happened
upon
early
in
my
beerdrinking
existence
and
have
only
recently
gotten
around
to
returning
to
it
it
pours
a
hazy
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
belgian
yeast
clove
red
apple
skin
and
toffee
the
taste
brings
more
of
the
same
to
the
table
well
cup
anyway
with
some
additions
of
black
pepper
banana
nutmeg
and
rye
bread
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mildly
grainy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
wbock
its
pretty
clear
why
many
would
consider
it
the
standard
of
the
style
a
pretty
good
beer
thats
complex
and
relatively
easy
to
find
i
dont
see
myself
rushing
out
to
buy
bottles
of
this
as
its
a
tad
pricey
i
think
id
opt
for
other
weizenhybrid
beers
than
this
this
is
a
really
good
beer
nothing
to
complain
about
or
negative
comments
just
something
that
was
a
good
drink
but
also
something
i
would
not
consider
having
more
than
1
glass
d
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
amazing
beer
i
love
this
brew
definitely
in
my
top
10
i
am
blown
away
by
the
flavor
balance
and
complexity
the
finish
leaves
me
wanting
more
and
more
world
class
stuff
for
sure
d
quite
a
bit
going
on
here
and
super
easy
to
drink
the
cpj
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
hefenweizen
that
tastes
of
more
intensely
of
dark
fruits
than
of
bananas
really
interesting
brew
d
this
is
quite
delicious
and
id
love
to
have
this
again
would
love
to
try
this
with
10
years
on
it
stuff
is
delicious
really
but
a
definate
sipper
tasty
great
aroma
definate
must
try
drinkability
maybe
i
need
to
give
this
another
try
but
it
really
just
is
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
the
aroma
is
interesting
but
the
flavor
just
comes
up
a
bit
short
a
500
ml
bottle
with
the
renewed
unappealing
label
and
crowncap
saying

into
tulip
pours
turbid
rubybrown
body
overlain
by
thick
long
lasting
beige
head
that
clings
to
the
walls
and
after
finally
subsides
forms
a
permanent
thick
solid
cloth
weizenbock
can
be
tought
of
as
doppelbock
whose
grist
bill
includes
some
wheat
malt
therefore
its
organoleptic
qualities
should
be
a
mixture
of
doppelbock
and
german
wheat
beer
so
the
aroma
is
bocklike
melanoidins
bready
malt
ripened
plum
clove
phenolics
banana
esters
and
evident
alcohol
the
palate
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
bocklike
melanoidins
dark
fruits
plums
and
raisins
wheat
flavor
clove
and
spicy
alcohol
that
helps
to
balance
the
malt
and
brings
warming
sensation
full
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
although
not
as
prickly
as
expected
considering
the
carbonation
a
nice
marriage
of
bock
and
weizen
qualities
albeit
a
bit
to
alcoholic
d
high
d
abv
hidden
well
decent
brew
and
not
that
difficult
to
drink
recommended
for
people
unfamiliar
with
the
style
d
an
excellent
highly
refined
weizenbock
great
balance
of
wheat
malt
spunky
weizen
yeast
character
and
delicate
mouthfeel
easily
easily
drinkable
and
more
refreshing
than
any
beer
this
big
has
a
right
to
be
dthe
complexity
seems
to
diminish
but
the
aftertaste
becomes
almost
stronger
through
out
the
bottle
its
a
very
heavy
beer
and
it
doesnt
seem
to
go
down
too
quickly
tho
it
does
go
down
enjoyably
d
great
overall
i
could
not
very
find
a
hint
that
it
is
8
2abv
flavors
are
all
there
and
this
sets
a
bench
mark
for
the
style
d
a
must
try
for
any
fan
of
doppels
in
general
and
for
wheat
fans
who
havent
crossed
into
the
dark
side
it
will
not
disappoint
d
the
high
level
of
alcohol
comes
out
soon
and
with
the
consistent
body
makes
this
beer
not
so
drinkable
overall
this
really
is
the
best
weizenbock
out
there
back
to
back
with
weihenstephan
that
was
good
this
was
excellent
the
actual
wheat
does
stand
out
more
in
this
one
despite
it
being
both
stronger
and
darker
i
recently
tried
a
few
weizenbocks
and
did
a
little
comparing
this
was
a
good
weizenbock
but
a
little
heavy
for
my
taste
this
poured
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
tall
offwhite
head
smells
of
wheat
banana
and
clove
taste
is
similar
but
included
some
malts
mouthfeel
was
thick
too
think
for
my
taste
the
heavy
feel
really
brought
down
the
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
would
suggest
checking
out
some
others
too
overall
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
fairly
light
for
how
dark
it
is
a
great
beer
to
have
dpretty
easy
drinking
on
another
note
there
were
some
nice
fruity
hints
in
the
smell
but
the
bitter
finish
ruined
any
pleasantness
i
had
with
this
beer
this
was
a
very
good
beer
that
offered
lots
of
complex
flavor
i
seemed
to
discover
something
new
with
every
sip
an
excellent
beer
and
a
standard
do
not
pass
this
one
up
on
tap
drinkability
i
gotta
say
i
think
this
was
a
bad
beer
bottle
there
was
nothing
that
stood
out
even
when
it
warmed
to
room
temp
i
am
buying
it
again
to
try
and
see
if
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
notes
what
else
can
i
say
its
a
great
beer
the
only
thing
i
would
like
to
have
had
with
this
beer
is
a
little
more
head
retention
served
on
tap
at
pizza
paradiso
dc
floralcitrusy
nose
hazy
and
dark
color
smooth
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
caramel
taste
at
the
beginning
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
excellent
example
of
a
weizenbock
could
drink
this
until
i
fell
off
the
stool
aventinus
was
brown
in
color
with
some
haze
very
hazy
after
the
second
pour
it
had
a
large
beige
head
with
good
retention
and
spotty
lacing
the
smell
was
nice
with
caramel
banana
clove
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
was
nice
with
toasted
wheat
banana
dark
fruit
pepper
and
caramel
hefeweizen
meets
doppelbock
it
was
sweet
upfront
and
the
finish
was
long
and
semidry
it
was
mediumfull
in
body
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
drinkabity
was
good
this
is
an
excellent
weizenbock
and
worth
seeking
out
d
could
have
this
anytime
be
it
the
dead
of
winter
or
on
a
warm
sunny
day
just
watch
yourself
though
aesthetically
beautiful
with
a
world
class
flavor
and
balance
enjoy
one
of
the
best
lagers
in
the
world
d
this
is
a
spicy
warming
beer
that
is
great
on
a
cold
night
in
front
of
a
fireplace
the
sort
of
beer
you
sip
while
reading
a
good
book
or
watching
a
movie
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
and
for
the
price
its
a
great
buy
poured
from
bottle
into
stein
poors
a
dark
copper
huge
thick
head
low
carbonation
and
no
lacing
smells
of
malt
banana
clove
and
pepper
medium
body
smooth
and
well
rounded
with
some
nice
banana
not
bitter
but
a
nice
long
lasting
kick
that
trickles
down
your
throat
after
taste
is
spicy
and
warm
one
of
my
favorite
weizenbocks
db
very
solid
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
somehow
8
drinks
very
well
and
is
truly
crafted
with
brewing
mastery
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
at
8
abv
you
have
to
be
very
careful
each
bottle
has
the
alcohol
content
of
about
3
regular
beers
which
is
why
most
people
are
one
and
done
d
pretty
good
and
surprisingly
drinkable
the
abv
stays
hidden
even
after
some
warming
up
i
think
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
another
beer
in
this
style
that
can
beat
this
on
out
on
aroma
and
flavor
it
may
be
a
personal
preference
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
in
my
opinion
huzzah
to
german
brewing
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
excessively
drinkable
for
more
than
8
the
alcohol
is
mastectomy
hidden
i
never
once
got
any
sensation
of
alcohol
flavor
or
warmth
additional
pours
produce
an
increased
amount
of
sediment
in
the
glass
which
brings
out
more
bready
and
bananalike
flavors
i
would
have
this
again
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
t
his
beer
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
but
at
8
2
abv
one
or
two
is
about
all
i
will
have
at
any
one
time
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
top
10
beer
for
me
and
fights
for
a
top
5
spot
drinkability
one
and
done
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
great
beer
nonetheless
aventinus
pours
a
very
dark
purple
threatening
to
cross
into
brown
there
are
noticeable
light
red
highlights
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
bone
colored
head
is
dominating
the
glass
five
fingers
plus
right
after
the
pour
and
it
doesnt
look
like
its
going
anywhere
anytime
soon
only
downside
is
that
lacing
is
a
bit
weak
the
nose
to
me
is
like
a
clove
forward
hefe
on
steroids
a
ton
of
clove
some
banana
and
a
fair
amount
of
vanillaesque
sweetness
that
i
always
get
from
wheat
no
real
hint
of
the
darker
malts
used
in
this
one
though
which
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
the
flavor
makes
up
for
it
though
as
in
addition
to
the
aforementioned
hefe
notes
theres
a
generous
dollop
of
caramel
and
a
dash
of
fruitiness
almost
straight
plum
the
final
piece
that
elevates
aventinus
to
true
greatness
is
the
slight
pleasant
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
the
body
is
great
nice
and
full
without
spilling
over
into
a
stoutlike
richness
carbonation
is
similarly
top
notch
a
bit
on
the
low
side
but
very
sharp
nonetheless
theres
just
something
keeping
it
from
perfection
i
think
maybe
the
body
could
stand
to
be
just
a
touch
bigger
this
beer
is
just
another
reason
along
with
the
eisbock
hefe
and
brooklyn
collab
that
schneider
is
my
favorite
german
brewery
a
true
classic
great
overall
ive
had
a
few
regular
bottles
and
a
2003
it
ages
well
d
very
drinkable
super
refreshing
drinkability
extreme
bring
me
more
d
so
highly
drinkable
and
very
deceptive
abv
id
put
a
few
back
before
i
realized
what
hit
me
a
bit
high
in
the
abv
but
the
500ml
is
perfect
because
anymore
would
be
just
too
rich
a
perfect
portion
of
this
amazing
beer
d
a
good
beer
but
i
guess
im
a
little
underwhlemed
by
this
brew
very
sweet
not
cloying
but
lacking
some
in
complexity
i
will
give
a
fresh
bottle
a
run
sometime
and
see
if
the
time
in
the
cellar
hurt
this
guy
d
very
drinkable
easily
a
top
15
beer
for
me
i
perfer
the
aged
2003
better
than
the
current
shelf
bottles
it
was
either
a
2009
or
10
drinkability
i
cant
stop
sipping
this
stuff
very
good
highly
drinkable
except
for
the
hight
abv
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
sure
m
and
d
again
smooth
is
the
operative
term
here
medium
body
with
just
enough
carbonation
finishes
dry
and
a
little
sweet
just
a
great
beer
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
still
warms
nicely
d
this
is
terrific
but
the
carbonation
is
overdone
gentle
but
plentiful
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
lightly
for
a
medium
bodied
beer
the
fairly
dry
and
clean
finish
with
only
a
hint
of
an
aftertaste
combined
with
a
well
hidden
alcohol
content
makes
aventinus
much
too
drinkable
overall
what
was
most
impressive
about
this
brew
was
its
aroma
it
is
bold
complex
and
has
every
little
scent
a
weizenbock
should
the
flavors
in
the
taste
were
delicious
to
say
the
least
but
were
not
as
robust
as
suggested
from
their
smells
one
curious
note
was
how
present
the
alcohol
was
for
a
beer
of
8
2
while
this
is
admittedly
higher
than
some
for
the
style
there
are
many
that
meet
and
exceed
that
while
masking
it
a
bit
better
this
is
not
to
say
that
it
was
unpleasant
but
rather
unexpected
drink
another
beer
that
is
among
the
best
ive
ever
had
it
has
a
fantastic
appearance
and
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
this
beer
tastes
delicious
and
is
well
worth
seeking
out
wow
one
of
the
things
i
would
have
liked
to
have
had
in
scheidner
weisss
original
hefe
was
a
stronger
flavor
and
this
beer
delivers
just
that
this
beer
is
outstanding
all
of
the
flavors
you
want
and
expect
in
a
hefeweizen
plus
the
added
malt
taste
puts
this
as
one
of
my
favorite
beers
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
abv
this
is
a
top
shelf
offering
highly
recommend
bravo
i
wonder
what
its
like
on
tap
d
lovely
stuff
this
is
about
a
year
and
a
half
old
but
still
very
worthy
drinkability
quite
possibly
my
favorite
german
beer
ive
been
drinking
this
for
over
5
years
and
keep
going
back
im
highly
disappointed
but
thats
the
chances
you
take
in
this
hobby
d
this
beer
drinks
like
an
easy
pounder
but
that
abv
will
hurt
you
a
note
on
food
pairing
if
youre
ever
in
the
hunt
for
a
good
breakfast
food
beer
pairing
i
would
highly
recommend
the
way
this
compliments
buttery
breakfast
items
like
french
toast
and
belgian
waffles
or
sage
sausages
i
found
this
500ml
bottle
for
4
its
also
always
refreshing
to
see
this
brew
in
the
top
100
deviating
form
the
ipa
stout
barrel
aged
sour
dominated
list
fantastic
classic
example
of
the
style
to
measure
others
to
a
classic
wheat
doppelbock
germanys
original
according
to
the
label
this
has
long
been
a
favorite
many
tastings
over
the
years
have
confirmed
its
consistency
and
suitability
for
pairing
with
strong
or
rich
foods
pickled
herring
and
smoked
whitefish
had
no
quarrel
with
this
overall
a
excellent
beer
quite
drinkable
for
the
abv
as
well
actually
for
how
strong
it
is
i
would
number
it
the
champion
of
drinkability
d
extremely
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
d
alcohol
masked
flavors
strong
price
eh
its
good
on
occasion
but
it
was
seriously
the
smoothest
beer
i
could
drink
today
a
germany
win
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
the
vintage
i
enjoyed
it
but
realized
in
the
end
that
i
prefer
the
fresher
version
i
still
recommend
trying
to
the
aged
version
this
one
caught
me
by
surprise
i
was
not
expecting
this
to
be
what
it
was
but
damn
what
a
surpise
d
the
taste
is
so
complicated
that
every
sip
is
like
a
taste
adventure
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
ill
be
giving
to
my
wine
drinking
friends
as
counterpoint
d
nothing
overly
special
about
this
beer
best
aspect
may
be
how
well
the
alcohol
is
hidden
which
does
contribute
to
some
good
drinkability
smooth
enough
to
go
down
easy
would
not
drink
too
many
of
these
as
you
might
end
up
in
trouble
but
you
couldnt
tell
from
any
of
this
beers
traits
that
it
was
8
2
d
very
balanced
for
style
and
loaded
with
rich
complex
flavors
a
pleasing
beer
for
a
person
who
enjoys
a
full
flavor
a
classic
for
the
style
drink
slowly
to
enjoy
all
this
has
to
offer
if
you
chugged
it
you
wont
know
but
as
it
is
very
tough
to
drink
overall
i
had
been
putting
off
trying
this
beer
for
entirely
too
long
something
i
now
know
a
very
good
beer
serving
as
the
benchmark
for
the
style
well
worth
a
shot
taste
was
very
smooth
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
8
2
raisins
sweet
malt
clove
some
banana
pleasant
yeast
flavor
really
well
balanced
flavor
the
beer
had
nice
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
finished
with
a
good
spicy
aftertaste
pours
a
deep
amber
brown
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
foam
head
has
a
strong
aroma
of
dark
fruit
has
a
yeasty
clove
taste
with
dark
fruit
notes
on
the
backend
has
a
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
very
tasty
not
sure
it
will
stay
this
high
in
the
top
50
but
a
good
solid
brew
drinkability
is
great
amazingly
solid
for
a
beer
at
around
8
alcohol
this
is
one
excellent
beer
dont
pass
it
up
if
you
see
it
get
some
dark
brown
and
cream
beige
long
high
carbonation
banana
and
clove
aroma
and
flavor
ibid
weizenbock
is
one
who
deceives
or
looks
like
a
simple
weizen
in
flavor
though
more
bananas
but
its
8
2
alcohol
to
make
a
great
marsh
alcohol
appears
much
less
flavor
than
our
national
weizenbocks
making
this
great
beer
and
excellent
drinkability
drinkability
even
with
all
its
sweetness
this
beer
manages
to
strike
a
balance
so
as
to
not
be
cloying
a
very
well
balanced
and
well
done
weizenbock
drinkability
excellent
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
good
flavor
that
was
not
what
i
expected
unique
flavors
and
complexity
make
it
a
great
beer
you
can
start
to
the
abv
after
a
while
will
definitely
drink
again
d
a
very
nice
weizenbock
a
must
try
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
beer
it
was
an
experience
matched
by
no
other
while
i
may
not
enjoy
the
flavors
as
much
as
other
i
do
appreciate
the
quality
of
this
brew
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
definitely
one
to
pick
up
at
some
point
in
your
beer
journey
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
white
head
hoppy
hints
of
clove
and
coffee
smells
dominated
armoa
some
spice
and
hops
going
down
but
really
dominated
by
the
malts
very
smooth
and
balanced
in
body
very
drinkable
as
it
goes
down
real
smooth
and
has
great
taste
but
its
very
pricey
more
of
a
once
with
a
fancy
meal
than
anythingelse
the
taste
is
just
like
a
weissbier
but
stronger
of
alcohol
and
malt
sweetness
is
present
but
not
too
strong
and
also
some
bitters
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
thick
and
chewy
brew
and
is
just
what
the
style
should
be
one
is
enough
but
session
drinking
could
be
possible
if
taken
slow
highly
recommended
and
an
asset
to
the
style
high
drinkabilty
as
it
tastes
like
a
lower
abv
and
its
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
few
beers
that
nears
absolute
perfection
to
me
itd
be
hard
to
believe
they
get
much
better
than
this
d
could
drink
this
all
day
preferably
at
a
bier
garten
in
deutschland
the
abv
is
masked
scarily
well
boozy
aftertaste
is
pleasant
not
overwhelming
verdict
an
elite
beer
worth
tracking
down
having
only
a
minor
fault
here
and
there
i
didnt
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
very
reminiscient
of
a
belgian
quad
same
flouride
like
feel
and
power
i
prolly
wont
buy
this
again
but
thats
not
to
say
i
wont
drink
it
again
drinkability
a
good
eisbock
but
wow
would
this
be
hard
to
drink
in
large
quantity
but
then
again
why
would
you
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
excellent
represent
representation
of
it
d
limited
only
by
the
cost
and
higher
abv
for
me
a
session
is
managing
to
finish
a
full
22ounce
bottle
at
one
sitting
very
nice
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
it
is
full
of
flavor
yet
can
be
used
as
a
session
beer
as
well
overall
after
one
taste
its
easy
to
see
why
this
one
is
often
considered
the
archetype
of
weizenbocks
if
you
like
wheat
beer
go
seek
it
out
now
d
excellent
what
a
wonderful
beer
i
cant
believe
ive
lived
in
germany
almost
3
years
and
have
never
tried
it
drinkability
an
exceptional
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
certainly
its
standard
bearer
if
only
for
the
experience
its
a
musttry
d
overall
a
very
tasty
offering
the
flavours
are
very
unique
and
fruity
and
make
for
a
very
pleasurable
experience
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
for
me
but
thats
more
of
a
personal
preference
worthy
offering
to
any
wiezenbock
fan
d
if
you
like
apple
cider
and
dont
mind
wheat
beer
you
will
enjoy
this
all
the
same
i
think
i
prefer
the
regular
aventinus
deep
amber
hue
with
glowing
brown
and
orange
highlights
this
one
pours
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
about
three
or
more
inches
tall
and
off
white
powerful
aroma
with
lots
of
complex
layers
consisting
of
yeast
and
extremely
fruity
and
slightly
spiced
banana
clove
a
little
raisin
and
some
apricot
are
all
in
there
now
thats
wheat
beer
extremely
smooth
palate
with
lots
of
caramel
and
slightly
sticky
strong
banana
and
clove
flavors
with
a
nice
spicy
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
this
one
makes
me
moan
drink
well
my
friends
a
friend
of
mine
recommended
this
beer
as
being
one
of
his
absolute
favorites
and
i
can
absolutely
understand
why
a
truly
fantastic
beer
very
tasty
but
definitely
a
sipper
for
8
2
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
a
bit
but
its
still
very
drinkable
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
finally
and
would
definitely
buy
again
drinkability
with
the
nottoolingering
aftertaste
and
higher
complexity
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
around
in
the
fridge
and
share
with
friends
maybe
a
little
too
much
to
go
back
to
too
often
though
this
does
not
seem
like
an
8
2
alcohol
beer
sweet
spicy
and
dry
makes
for
an
interesting
and
quaffable
beer
that
defines
the
style
final
thoughts
for
a
widely
available
import
this
was
a
very
solid
wheat
doppelbock
while
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
beer
i
dont
think
ill
be
going
back
to
it
time
and
again
for
my
money
ill
stick
with
weihenstephaner
vitus
nice
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
beer
is
smooth
and
easydrinking
i
could
sip
this
all
night
this
is
a
pretty
young
bottle
and
i
plan
on
aging
the
next
one
for
a
bit
longer
overall
i
think
the
aventinus
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
what
i
expected
having
said
that
it
is
great
for
its
style
the
doppelbock
at
8
5
the
500
ml
bottle
serves
well
on
its
own
very
cool
bottle
and
labeling
with
the
regal
colours
and
logo
d
i
had
no
issues
with
finishing
this
in
fact
i
wish
i
had
another
alcohol
is
no
issue
and
the
sweetness
is
enough
to
notice
but
not
get
in
the
way
of
enjoying
a
full
bottle
after
hopfenweizen
this
is
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
great
beer
drinkability
not
a
session
beer
but
one
to
enjoy
after
supper
on
a
cold
winter
evening
d
very
good
brew
goes
down
quite
smooth
for
a
strong
beer
would
recommend
this
to
any
beer
drinker
who
respects
quality
in
their
mouth
d
this
is
a
nice
wisenbock
and
a
standout
for
me
in
the
style
d
quite
drinkable
the
abv
is
completely
hidden
got
a
little
more
cloying
as
it
warmed
up
but
i
still
had
no
problem
finishing
the
pint
incredible
beer
certainly
deserves
its
place
at
the
top
of
the
weizenbock
list
drinkabilityalthough
i
do
prefer
the
aventinus
eisbock
in
terms
of
flavor
their
regular
weizenbock
is
definitely
more
drinkable
addictively
so
d
this
one
took
me
by
a
bit
of
a
surprise
extremely
delicious
and
drinkable
highly
recommended
solid
beer
for
my
first
ever
weizenbock
very
good
beer
i
think
this
one
is
going
to
grow
on
me
all
the
taste
of
a
nonwheat
dobblebock
with
a
much
lighter
feel
and
more
alcohol
this
shames
all
the
other
dark
wheat
beers
ive
had
d
really
good
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
amber
hues
and
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruits
and
malts
taste
is
good
fruits
malts
spices
very
flavorful
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
beer
having
this
beer
on
tap
in
its
own
glass
is
a
special
event
its
a
tall
glass
slim
at
bottom
and
quite
wide
at
top
my
favorite
style
of
beer
is
a
weizenbock
and
as
you
would
expect
i
enjoy
the
slight
sweetness
and
maltiness
of
this
beer
it
really
deserves
a
place
among
beers
such
as
chimay
bleu
westvleteren
rochefort
as
an
amazing
beer
that
has
withstood
the
test
of
time
schneider
brews
some
damn
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
also
good
smooth
slightly
thick
and
with
a
refreshing
carbonation
bite
this
aids
in
drinkability
because
the
brew
goes
down
in
gulps
this
is
my
go
to
beer
i
love
this
one
pours
a
very
explosive
hazy
brown
with
an
oat
colored
head
smells
of
malts
dark
fruits
and
some
banana
there
is
sediment
on
the
bottom
i
always
make
sure
my
last
pour
is
like
a
quarter
goblet
to
get
a
lot
of
the
sediment
mixed
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
so
good
mmmm
the
first
sip
is
nice
carbonation
clove
banana
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
great
mouthfeel
there
is
no
bitterness
from
the
hops
apparent
this
beer
finishes
sweet
and
smooth
with
little
aftertaste
to
deal
with
all
it
leaves
is
you
wanting
more
and
i
could
drink
three
or
four
of
these
and
sleep
well
on
the
floor
in
a
corner
fully
dressed
or
not
d
leaning
heavily
on
the
spicy
flavours
it
still
manages
to
find
a
good
balance
very
carbonated
makes
it
more
light
and
refreshing
and
also
helps
to
mask
the
high
abv
both
flavourful
and
enjoyable
to
drink
probably
the
best
bock
ive
had
2004
vintage
from
a
5l
bottle
into
a
snifter
room
temperature
1
finger
head
white
lacing
heavy
apple
nose
and
present
in
the
taste
interseting
and
only
revealed
by
aging
curiously
transparent
ruby
body
mucho
sediment
quite
sweet
almost
like
a
cider
unibroues
ephemere
comes
to
mind
apple
and
honey
are
dominant
wheat
is
curiously
absent
considering
the
style
and
the
flavor
of
a
young
aventinus
mouthfeel
not
exceptional
some
prickling
from
coarse
carbonation
taste
is
incredibly
drinkable
but
the
price
for
a
vintage
is
prohibitive
for
those
capable
of
cellaring
their
own
that
might
be
an
option
drinkability
is
high
unless
you
cloy
at
sweeter
beers
pours
a
hazy
ruby
brown
colour
with
thick
white
head
and
nice
lacing
smells
of
banana
and
cloves
like
a
hefe
but
then
has
a
nice
chocolate
and
cherry
smell
too
flavour
has
a
lot
of
sweetness
but
not
too
much
really
balanced
flavours
alcohol
is
high
in
this
beer
but
i
can
barely
notice
it
at
all
wonderfully
drinkable
i
dont
think
i
like
this
as
much
as
a
fresher
version
of
aventinus
but
i
still
think
its
a
remarkable
beer
dazzlingly
complex
a
superb
beer
and
testament
to
the
lasting
legacy
of
the
german
brewers
craft
the
nose
is
wonderful
rich
bready
with
a
wonderful
yeasty
phenolic
character
some
chocolate
dark
fruit
specifically
plums
and
raisins
a
mild
clove
character
a
little
bubblegum
this
really
is
complex
and
wonderfully
balanced
caramel
a
little
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
are
also
present
the
palate
is
just
as
remarkably
balanced
banana
bread
with
chocolate
chips
drizzled
with
warm
caramel
and
brown
sugar
come
to
mind
and
despite
plenty
of
sweet
flavors
this
never
gets
tiring
on
the
palate
the
wheat
is
noticeable
but
never
distracting
presenting
a
freshly
baked
dark
wheat
breadlike
character
clove
a
little
nutmeg
and
some
cinnamon
sugar
are
also
present
particularly
on
the
midpalate
raisins
and
plums
also
appear
closer
to
the
finish
the
yeasty
flavors
arent
as
prominent
as
the
nose
would
suggest
though
some
phenolic
character
is
present
mildly
sweet
on
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
caramel
and
brown
sugar
this
is
fabulous
stuff
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
feels
almost
exceptional
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
just
fantastic
and
im
ashamed
to
admit
ive
drunk
as
little
of
it
as
i
have
its
very
satisfying
very
quenching
uniquely
complex
and
an
incredible
treat
to
enjoy
i
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
every
time
i
have
it
i
am
reminded
of
why
i
love
real
beer
so
much
the
combination
of
flavors
in
the
beer
also
makes
it
a
terrific
pairing
with
so
many
foods
almost
anything
rich
that
has
been
grilled
or
seared
is
going
to
be
great
rich
tomato
pastas
and
lasagna
hearty
cheeses
and
thick
soups
work
brilliantly
too
the
best
may
be
desert
though
flourless
chocolate
cake
with
a
plum
and
raisin
reduction
sauce
is
the
ultimate
pairing
for
this
gamechanging
beer
very
tasty
and
light
it
goes
down
smooth
and
overall
was
a
very
good
beer
that
breaks
the
mold
of
a
weisse
beer
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
drinkability
its
very
flavorful
many
layers
and
quite
smooth
abv
lends
a
slight
warming
on
the
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
but
could
not
take
on
more
than
one
bottle
per
session
very
very
drinkable
i
realy
cant
belive
its
8
2
hardly
any
alchohol
taste
to
me
at
all
very
pleasent
to
drink
and
the
longer
beetween
sips
the
more
the
aftertaste
makes
you
need
another
great
beer
one
of
my
new
favs
a
co
worker
said
it
was
bad
i
cant
wait
to
tell
him
he
was
wrong
a
must
try
beer
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
this
type
of
brew
but
i
cant
imagine
it
being
outdone
this
is
one
of
those
big
unfiltered
flavored
brews
that
make
you
love
beer
all
over
again
i
could
session
this
all
night
despite
its
higher
alcohol
level
d
my
favorite
weizenbock
if
you
havent
had
this
before
you
should
try
it
asap
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
good
for
gulping
or
sipping
perhaps
not
the
very
best
tasting
of
this
beer
since
im
fairly
certain
this
bottle
has
quite
a
bit
of
age
on
it
its
in
good
shape
in
terms
of
just
holding
up
to
age
and
oxidation
but
the
flavors
are
much
less
punchy
its
none
the
less
still
the
best
example
ive
had
of
the
style
by
a
mile
update
got
a
better
bottle
methinks
carb
was
better
and
flavors
more
pronounced
d
found
it
to
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
just
not
sure
if
its
my
style
but
would
reccomend
trying
for
sure
all
in
all
a
very
inoffensive
yet
tasty
beer
it
wont
necessarily
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
since
i
like
my
beer
to
be
a
little
more
interesting
and
dynamic
but
this
is
definitely
a
great
beer
great
example
of
the
style
but
i
would
say
that
35
years
is
far
too
long
to
age
this
beer
i
like
the
bottles
fresh
to
a
year
or
so
tastes
good
goes
down
nicely
but
i
feel
like
more
than
one
or
two
and
the
mouthfeel
would
really
start
to
bug
me
drinkability
smooth
creamy
thirst
quenching
orgasmic
numbing
i
dont
know
what
else
to
write
my
first
few
sips
almost
drove
me
to
tears
if
there
is
a
heaven
this
is
no
doubt
on
tap
this
is
my
first
experience
with
weizenbock
and
i
am
without
a
doubt
blown
away
superb
t
perfect
sensation
in
the
mouth
does
not
feel
heavy
at
all
are
perceived
caramel
and
the
characteristic
flavor
of
wheat
with
a
final
toast
tenuous
but
very
long
where
alcohol
is
accentuated
and
feels
like
a
strong
beer
d
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
surprisingly
light
for
the
style
and
heft
of
the
beer
style
id
rate
drinkabilty
higher
if
it
werent
for
the
8
2
abv
which
if
you
drink
this
beer
quickly
like
i
did
makes
you
feel
it
darn
good
beer
notes
well
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
my
gateway
drug
to
german
beer
ive
had
a
few
here
and
there
but
i
find
many
of
the
american
beers
that
call
themselves
hefeweizens
complete
boring
which
led
me
to
avoid
real
hefeweizens
and
i
havent
had
a
wheat
ale
in
a
long
time
not
to
mention
when
i
moved
to
san
diego
i
found
karl
strauss
which
used
to
specialize
in
germanstyle
beer
to
be
the
weaker
of
the
amazing
local
breweries
not
so
much
anymore
karl
strauss
has
really
stepped
up
their
game
schneider
aventinus
just
completely
converted
me
thank
god
toronado
sd
sent
out
their
promo
email
this
is
truly
a
remarkable
beer
i
think
im
going
on
a
weizenbock
binge
as
i
have
been
with
ipas
drinkability
you
wouldnt
be
able
to
tell
this
was
over
8
drinks
like
a
5
hefe
i
could
drink
a
few
bottles
of
this
definitely
strangely
refreshing
on
an
82
degree
night
d
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
for
me
its
more
of
a
summerearly
fall
beer
that
said
i
would
never
turn
one
down
d
oh
god
does
this
beer
go
down
smooth
if
it
wasnt
for
the
8
abv
and
the
4
price
tag
id
probably
find
more
special
occasions
to
enjoy
this
beer
as
it
is
i
think
aventinus
is
a
perfect
beer
and
nothing
will
inhibit
my
drinking
of
it
d
very
nice
beer
very
easy
to
drink
be
careful
counting
this
as
one
of
my
favorites
exceptional
brew
poured
one
for
my
wife
to
sample
and
she
loved
it
shes
already
planning
to
buy
more
as
christmas
presents
for
the
family
d
a
nice
weizenbock
very
easy
to
drink
and
some
nice
banana
in
the
smell
and
taste
would
try
again
i
didnt
quite
know
what
to
make
of
this
at
first
its
almost
like
chocolate
banana
bread
if
i
can
say
that
but
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
liked
it
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
bottle
brown
copper
pour
with
thick
head
aromas
of
bananas
mostly
with
lots
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
thin
bubbles
delivers
the
flavors
perfectly
the
aromas
are
perfectly
delivered
in
the
taste
banana
cake
with
cocoa
for
something
so
readily
available
this
is
one
of
the
best
d
very
drinkable
beer
that
was
actually
tasty
and
was
surprising
because
on
the
real
german
brews
dont
really
tickle
my
pickle
low
carbonation
probably
all
was
gone
in
that
head
surprisingly
light
body
would
be
really
perfect
on
an
early
fall
day
when
theres
a
little
crispness
in
the
air
because
theres
enough
alcohol
in
it
to
provide
a
little
warmth
great
drinkability
although
as
with
all
beer
seasonal
serving
type
bottle
d
i
offer
this
as
a
challenge
to
everyone
who
says
he
doesnt
like
wheat
beers
excellent
stuff
this
beer
pours
a
peculiar
but
intruiging
off
brown
reddish
color
with
a
decent
clarity
and
a
beautiful
white
foamy
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
aroma
is
on
point
and
has
that
banana
fosters
aroma
of
caramalized
brown
sugar
bananas
cinnamon
and
a
touch
of
honey
malty
and
dark
fruitiness
on
the
aroma
the
taste
is
on
point
with
a
touch
of
astrigenty
alcohol
bite
on
the
finish
sugary
but
on
point
with
the
style
has
a
nice
toasted
marshmallow
component
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
very
nice
as
its
carbonated
to
all
hell
with
a
semi
dry
finish
drinkability
is
very
high
as
well
as
its
got
a
nice
delicious
factor
and
pairs
well
with
poultry
and
other
lighter
fare
meals
a
definate
cold
fall
night
beer
mfd
a
really
smooth
beer
not
overly
carbonated
and
pleasing
to
the
palate
even
though
im
not
a
weizen
drinker
certainly
didnt
taste
the
8
2
all
8
6
abv
are
completely
absent
this
is
extremely
and
dangerously
drinkable
as
a
lover
of
bavarian
beers
this
is
fantastic
drinks
like
a
potent
and
sweet
dunkel
with
5
abv
try
this
i
still
like
the
way
the
beer
looks
but
this
bottle
produced
a
much
more
controlled
head
than
the
previous
batch
the
taste
was
much
better
than
i
remembered
complex
and
rich
its
a
mixture
of
chocolates
grains
and
dark
fruits
sneaky
drinkability
with
none
of
the
harshness
i
previously
noticed
basically
its
a
dopplebock
that
drinks
like
a
weizen
which
is
exactly
what
this
style
should
produce
poured
from
a
bottle
into
an
aventinus
glass
coolest
looking
glass
ever
amazing
looking
beer
as
it
is
a
dark
amber
towards
the
top
and
hazy
at
the
bottom
with
about
34
inch
of
head
very
smooth
and
balanced
smell
the
taste
is
amazingly
complex
balance
like
the
smell
with
the
taste
of
some
cloves
and
bananas
excellent
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
with
the
alcohol
hidden
well
refreshing
like
a
wheat
beer
but
in
a
manly
way
if
that
makes
any
sense
it
may
not
be
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
definately
my
favorite
very
drinkable
and
delicious
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
redbrown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
great
with
notes
of
bananas
cloves
toffee
and
vanilla
for
the
flavor
i
get
caramel
malt
bananas
cloves
and
toffee
with
a
fair
bit
of
alcohol
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
great
beer
d
seems
fairly
filling
but
i
did
have
another
beer
before
it
i
would
not
want
more
than
one
500ml
bottle
in
a
night
this
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
favorite
beers
its
a
smooth
german
doppleback
thats
easy
to
drink
which
surprised
me
considering
the
abv
this
wheat
beer
has
a
wonderful
banana
smell
and
aftertaste
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation

an

color

i
poured

off

tan

it
is
dark
amberburnt
orange
in
color
you
could
almost
call

the
aroma

clove

the

the
spices
and
carbonation
tickle
my
tongue
and
throat
i
can
can
taste
the
toffee
malt
in
it
as
well
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
alcohol
is
hidden
nicely
always
a
classic
but
i
prefer
aventinus
fresh

3
of
us
are
presently
spliting
the
bottle
everyone
loves
it
but
feel
like
1
is
enough
for
one
day
notes
glad
and
surprised
to
get
hold
of
it
on
tap
nice
but
hmmm
i
may
stick
to
the
bottled
version
when
having
the
choice
between
the
two
the
taste
is
truly
complex
this
beer
has
the
character
of
a
dunkles
weizen
and
a
dunkles
bock
but
this
beer
has
a
crisp
clean
taste
that
one
doesnt
expect
from
a
weizenbock
the
body
is
full
of
dextrins
it
is
full
with
a
smooth
carbonation
that
keeps
it
from
being
cloying
yet
both
the
front
end
and
the
middle
of
this
beer
have
all
of
the
flavor
of
a
wiezenbock
spicy
cloves
bannana
and
bubble
gum
can
be
detected
yet
the
phenols
are
by
no
means
over
powering
this
beer
finishes
with
a
clean
dry
crisp
ending
that
is
quite
refreshing
alcohol
cannot
be
detected
until
the
finish
but
it
doesnt
overpower
which
makes
this
beer
quite
deceptive
its
8
2
abv
demands
respect
it
is
not
meant
to
be
guzzled
this
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
and
i
always
get
excited
to
drink
one
the
drinkability
is
almost
dangerous
considering
the
abv
d
this
is
a
great
beer
i
can
remember
having
one
of
these
fresh
at
the
brewery
a
few
years
ago
so
nothing
german
for
me
beats
an
aventinus
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
beer
very
much
like
a
belgian
beer
that
also
has
characteristics
of
a
hefeweizen
highly
recommended
and
something
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
again
d
i
dont
really
know
what
it
was
about
this
beer
but
for
some
reason
i
really
enjoyed
the
first
half
but
was
much
less
excited
about
the
second
half
maybe
it
would
have
been
better
outside
in
the
heat
instead
of
indoors
in
the
air
conditioning
notes
felt
more
belgian
than
german
to
me
d
love
this
beer
overall
a
deliciously
malty
weizenbock
with
great
balance
complex
drinkable
and
utterly
enjoyable
excellent
i
was
hesitant
to
post
tasting
notes
on
a
two
year
old
beer
but
this
one
really
shined
after
aging
on
par
scorewise
with
a
fresh
bottle
drink
it
drinkability
take
it
slow
with
this
one
but
for
how

flavor
it
has
its
very
doable
with
how

comes
in
one
bottle
500ml
youll
only
need
one

not
really

found
the

is
counterbalanced

very
very
drinkable

this
with
an
excellent

my
roommate
picked
up
a
schneider
weisse
the

day
and
im
looking
forward
to
comparing
it
to
this
its
massive
twin

the

calls
it

a

reading
all
the
rave
reviews
its
an

one
that
i
will
almost

seek
out

review
again

not

though
not
as
much
as
the

by
this

ddefinitely
a

my
doubts

beer

found
it
to

complex
and
flavorful
brew

not

any
one
way

be

up

in

gets

the

the
beer
wears

it
wants
to
be
savored
even
better
as
it
warmed
i
wish
i
had
another
one
next
time
real
good
stuff
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
love
this
style
it
is
very
soft
but
yet
very
complex
great
malt
and
hop
character
and
the
wheat
does
wonders
all
the
ingredients
play
well
together
in
this
brew
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
cloudy
amber
color
the
two
fingers
of
beige
head
displayed
great
retention
and
very
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
rather
sour
busy
and
slightly
sweet
wheat
alcohol
toffee
spices
and
some
fruity
esters
the
flavors
were
just
plain
outstanding
and
shocking
in
how
balanced
they
were
compared
to
the
sour
aroma
i
tasted
rich
malts
wheat
alcohol
heat
nuts
caramel
toffee
dark
fruits
in
the
esters
hints
of
chocolate
malt
and
spices
outstanding
complexity
and
drinkability
for
8
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
perfect
this
was
definitely
the
best
weizenbock
i
had
ever
tasted
and
speaking
purely
in
terms
of
flavor
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
a
must
try
overall
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
for
sure
this
is
definitely
loads
better
and
more
interesting
than
their
original
hefeweizen
only
the
look
kept
it
from
being
a
massive
smash
id
definitely
pick
up
more
of
these
and
i
will
probably
age
a
few
to
see
how
they
turn
out
world
class
brew
from
a
1
pint
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
the
bottle
was
cold
when
purchased
and
i
let
it
set
a
good
35
minutes
before
opening
aventinus
poured
a
lovely
deep
mahogany
into
the
glass
the
2
inch
foamy
head
was
thick
rich
and
slightly
off
white
it
settled
after
a
while
to
the
thickness
of
a
couple
of
quarters
oh
my
the
beautiful
aroma
hit
seconds
after
the
cap
came
off
and
before
i
even
tipped
the
bottle
the
chocolate
vanilla
banana
clove
and
rich
malts
danced
in
my
head
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
one
can
easily
pick
up
the
malts
creamy
chocolate
and
wheat
she
is
properly
carbonated
for
the
style
and
the
ingredients
god
supplied
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
dances
in
your
mouth
and
goes
down
ever
so
smoothly
a
wonderful
beer
for
a
cold
night
or
anytime
extremely
drinkable
perfect
in
every
way
very
easily
drinkable
alcohol
is
quite
wellhidden
very
good
balance
overall
pours
a
cola
color
with
orange
peekoo
highlights
pretty
quick
head
but
good
bubbling
nice
ring
o
foam
wheaty
bananas
and
cloves
mixed
with
some
faint
caramel
malts
and
a
little
bubblgum
some
light
sugar
water
drizzled
over
soe
cooked
bananas
and
hot
breakfast
cereal
mad
mostly
of
wheat
lots
of
cloves
with
maybe
a
few
pruins
the
alcohol
adds
to
the
fruity
flavors
of
this
beer
but
cuts
some
of
the
yeasty
flavors
away
the
alcohol
also
adds
a
nice
long
warming
linger
to
the
flavor
and
palate
would
almost
taste
and
feel
sessionble
until
the
beer
warms
up
but
the
alcohol
is
no
overwhelming
in
the
least
d
i
picked
one
up
casually
on
the
way
home
from
work
and
now
im
legally
unable
to
drive
back
and
get
a
couple
more
for
a
while
thats
the
only
problem
i
have
with
it
i
guess
extremely
moreish
for
a
beer
with
such
a
pronounced
alcohol
character
a
very
good
beer
complex
and
refreshing
well
worth
the
price
and
hunting
it
down
i
bought
this
on
recommendation
from
one
of
my
residents
who
had
overflowing
praise
i
came
in
a
little
bit
skeptical
because
thats
just
the
way
i
take
other
peoples
recommendations
i
enjoyed
it
though
d
dangerously
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
tasty
beer
a
few
pints
of
this
would
be
awesome
highly
recommended
a
beer
that
i
will
try
to
have
on
hand
d
a
good
beer
and
certainly
regarded
as
the
classic
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
weizenbocks
ive
had
for
sure
strong
tasty
flavours
make
this
a
sipper
space
it
out
over
an
hour
and
enjoy
purchased
at
a
local
liquor
store
out
of
sheer
curiosity
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
i
unknowingly
had
a
glass
from
the
brewery
from
a
previous
trip
to
bruisin
ales
that
just
happened
to
be
the
only
glass
large
enough
to
hold
the
beer
i
have
not
had
any
weizenbocks
before
this
so
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
it
had
a
sweet
taste
and
quite
a
bit
of
head
which
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
down
during
my
last
trip
to
bruisin
ales
i
picked
up
a
2004
bottle
of
the
aventinus
to
try
side
by
side
against
a
regular
bottle
of
it
to
see
how
it
changes
as
it
is
aged
for
those
who
have
not
tried
it
and
are
skeptical
about
its
universal
round
of
applause
yes
aventinus
really
is
all
that
it
pours
an
extremely
cloudy
spectrum
that
ranges
from
a
hazy
yellow
at
the
thinnest
points
in
the
glass
to
an
impenetrable
brown
at
its
deepest
with
a
big
frumpy
tan
head
standing
on
top
of
it
all
its
aromas
span
the
spectrum
of
straightforward
wheatiness
at
one
end
to
complex
dark
fruits
and
spices
at
the
other
yeastiness
also
comes
through
loud
and
clear
on
the
nose
as
it
does
on
the
palate
dark
fruits
including
prunes
raisins
and
berries
along
with
a
nice
toastiness
and
yeasty
softness
all
blend
on
together
in
perfect
harmony
for
the
past
5
years
ive
been
having
perhaps
two
or
three
of
these
per
year
no
matter
how
many
beers
in
the
same
or
approximate
categories
that
i
try
aventinus
remains
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
the
paradigm
for
the
style
it
has
all
the
attributes
of
a
hefe
and
a
bock
in
the
same
glass
at
the
same
time
it
takes
each
to
a
new
level
in
brewing
turbid
brown
body
with
a
fizzy
off
white
head
that
subsides
quickly
minimal
lace
smell
is
very
savory
vanilla
apple
clove
cocoa
and
banana
tastes
much
bigger
than
the
aroma
with
a
nice
bubblegumbananaclovevanilla
quality
up
front
followed
by
gingerbread
and
an
almost
vinuous
chalky
smooth
dry
finish
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
alcohol
is
well
hidden
one
of
the
finest
beers
out
there
outstanding
very
intense
taste
the
wheat
jumps
out
at
first
but
the
banana
and
vanilla
sit
in
the
back
of
the
throat
the
aftertaste
is
too
much
but
i
respect
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
alcohol
is
mostly
hidden
but
does
start
to
come
through
near
the
end
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
this
might
be
worth
picking
up
again
some
other
day
as
a
fan
of
hefeweizens
and
good
malt
beers
aventinus
should
not
be
overlooked
it
is
well
priced
and
worth
the
money
djust
one
of
two
drinks
very
well
for
the
abv
and
the
style
probably
couldnt
do
more
than
a
few
bombers
without
being
on
my
ass
but
amazing
never
the
less
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
smells
of
sweet
wheat
tastes
of
a
brown
ale
and
dopplebock
characteristics
good
clean
wheat
and
a
smooth
nutty
flavor
but
sweet
mouth
is
great
a
nice
rich
texture
goes
down
perfectly

head

very

easy

enough
about
the
feel
color
and
smell
what
a
great
beer
get
some
german
cheese
some
crackers
and
have
at
it
this
one
will
always
have
a
shelf
in
my
fridge
i
love
it
and
think
that
it
goes
very
well
with
german
food
it
just
tastes
like
germany
enjoy
brew
poured
into
a
weihenstephan
weizen
glass
has
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
fair
sized
light
tan
head
that
had
fair
retention
which
left
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
nice
fresh
fruit
highlighting
lemon
clearly
banana
guess
that
would
be
a
fruit
but
it
is
a
different
aroma
than
the
fruit
that
i
pick
up
whole
wheat
bread
and
cloves
the
flavors
are
clear
and
simply
excellent
rich
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
slight
chocolate
and
vanilla
hint
upfront
clearer
clove
and
banana
flavors
mixed
with
an
inviting
alcohol
taste
at
the
tail
end
spiciness
sticks
around
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
for
a
bit
nice
amount
of
carbonation
plays
well
with
the
flavors
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
but
imo
dangerous
as
it
goes
down
very
easily
but
i
am
already
feeling
empty
stomach
it
very
nice
brew
and
for
the
price
you
can
not
beat
it
interesting
not
somthing
ill
seek
out
again
but
definatly
good
to
try
i
will
tell
you
first
off
all
that
i
am
not
even
a
fan
of
wheat
beer
but
this
is
good
try
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
even
if
your
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beer
good
buy
and
a
good
treat
wowie
zowie
this
is
a
keeper
sweet
estery
malty
aroma
clove
banana
sweet
but
not
too
refreshing
subtle
bitterness
cuts
the
sweet
making
it
eminently
drinkable
no
idea
how
they
hide
8
2
so
well
clove
is
subtle
plays
well
with
the
hops
to
cut
the
sweetness
this
is
truely
a
great
beer
and
proves
why
six
generations
of
schneider
have
been
making
this
beer
the
same
way
drinkability
i
will
definitely
consider
getting
this
beer
again
it
is
a
very
good
beer
though
it
isnt
a
great
after
dinner
beer
so
dont
make
my
mistake

me
still
very
drinkable

not

it

its

it

more
of
that
clove

anise
spice
good
deal
of
carbonation
keeps
any
given
flavor
from
achieving
dominance
the
fruit
lowered
in
favor
of
wheat
halfbaked

although
more
banana
here
almost
banana

the

not

more

admirable
persistence
through
the
finish

although
i
would
like
to
see
these
in
bombers
i
believe
the
500ml
is
the
perfect
size
for
this
beer
i
could
drink
two
a
great
price
for
a
great
doppleweizen
bock
after

i
concluded
that
this
was
in
the
top
three
for
this
style
for
sure

one
of
my
favorites
from

lots

some

a
soft

undertone
there
may
be
a
good
bit
of

character
here
both
wheat

barley
but
the
focus
is
the
yeast
character
the
dark
fruit
esters
think
plums
prunes
and
maybe
raisins
are
a
bit
more
restrained
in
the
flavor
than
the
aroma
but
still
present
the
phenols
range
from
clove
to
indistinct
spicyness
to
hints
of
vanilla
the
esters
that
are
a
bit
more
prominent
are
those
classic
to
weissbiers
banana
with
just
a

present

it
again
lends

a

on
the

side
at

its
presence
adds
to
the
depth
of
flavor
and
isnt
at
all

solventy
drinkability
is
pretty
darn
good
this
brew
is
complex
but
nicely
balanced
and
fairly
nuanced
i
poured
from
a
500
ml
glass
into
a
weizen
glass
it
pours
an
amber
to
brown
color
with
a
massive
head
the
head
retreats
rather
quickly
with
no
lacing
the
first
thing
i
noticed
on
the
nose
was
a
weak
hint
of
cloves
this
was
quckly
replaced
by
a
candy
smell
with
some
alcohol
kicked
in
the
flavor
is
ripe
fruit
with
alcohol
and
caramel
notes
the
beer
is
medim
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
the
best
wheat
beer
i
have
tried
to
date
d
i
found
this
to
have
a
good
drinkability
but
in
moderation
as
the
alcohol
content
packs
a
punch
very
flavorful
and
interesting
to
drink
dvery
drinkable
though
not
to
excess
youll
fall
over
i
think
this
beer
is
a
great
beer
with
amazing
attributes
and
very
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
any
day
of
the
year
cheers
d
very
good
example
of
a
german
bock
with
a
nice
kick
comes
out
of
the
tap
an
opaque
chocolate
brown
with
a
fine
bubbled
pale
tan
head
very
appetizing
malty
and
chocolaty
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
rich
malty
smoky
flavor
has
chocolate
undertone
and
nutty
and
molasses
hints
and
just
a
whisper
of
sweetness
texture
is
smooth
and
tingly
giving
a
pleasing
finish
d
very
drinkable
a
great
representation
of
the
style
keep
an
eye
out
for
the
alcohol
as
it
will
take
you
by
surprise
notes
pretty
tasty
sometimes
i
misspell
the
name
of
this
one
this
poured
a
murky
copper
to
brown
in
color
with
a
moderate
extremely
bubbly
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
nose
is
semisweet
and
filled
with
banana
wheat
malt
and
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
raisin
and
spice
in
the
mouth
it
was
mediumbodied
rich
and
concentrated
showing
the
sweetness
from
the
mouth
this
had
great
balance
with
fresh
carbontaion
and
a
lingering
finish
there
is
nothing
out
of
place
in
this
one
it
is
just
enjoyable
from
beginning
to
end
well
it
took
about
4
years
but
i
finally
got
my
first
5
across
the
board
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
amber
almost
dirty
looking
with
a
very
creamy
white
head
and
tons
of
lacing
the
smell
is
of
bananas
the
taste
is
so
smooth
i
just
kept
wanting
more
there
was
a
huge
banana
flavor
matched
with
a
wonderful
malt
base
with
some
hints
of
toasted
malts
everything
is
perfectly
balanced
in
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
was
incredibly
creamy
and
the
carbonation
level
was
perfect
wow
such
an
incredibly
drinkable
brew
i
yearn
for
more
now
i
know
what
my
next
on
tap
suggestion
is
for
my
local
establishments
a
good
change
of
pace
beer
it
is
a
bit
difficult
to
find
where
this
beer
will
fit
in
its
not
a
session
beer
and
with
0
5l
bottles
its
not
an
apéritif
or
an
interest
beer
worthy
of
is
following
a
great
beer
to
reach
for
when
you
want
something
different
i
look
forward
to
comparing
this
german
classic
to
some
of
my
favorite
holiday
doppelbocks
i
will
definitely
pick
up
some
aventinus
again
ok
this
is
getting
to
be
a
bit
much
for
me
how
is
it
possible
that
i
find
similarities
in
three
beers
in
a
row
the
color
here
is
different
but
the
taste
yeah
nutty
and
malty
for
sure
but
some
of
that
same
brown
sugar
taste
not
the
sweet
part
fine
mouthfeel
im
just
not
interested
today
ive
got
to
go
and
grab
something
good
to
make
sure
that
its
not
just
an
off
day
for
me
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
amber
color
hugely
effervescent
with
a
fizzy
twofingered
light
tan
head
that
resists
fading
spotty
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
is
an
aggressive
combination
of
sweet
malty
caramel
and
spices
that
suggest
a
full
bodied
beverage
is
on
its
way
well
carbonated
and
spicy
the
mediumfull
bodied
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
complex
in
a
way
that
compliments
the
flavors
nicely
the
taste
is
a
mirror
of
the
nose
and
an
element
of
cloves
adds
a
minty
complexity
that
lingers
nicely
the
8
abv
warms
gently
a
real
nice
drinker
recommended
d
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
making
this
very
drinkable
just
dont
let
it
catch
up
to
you
a
full
spectrum
of
flavor
well
rounded
and
a
very
nice
drink
all
around
a
softer
state
of
carbonation
would
of
sealed
the
deal
here
yummy
yummy
in
my
tummmy
again
sweet
malts
up
front
such
complexity
in
this
brew
also
a
great
blend
of
citrusy
goodness
with
some
bannana
alcohol
has
a
great
warming
effect
overall
so
this
is
the
original
wheat
doppelbock
a
very
good
beer
made
by
an
excellent
brewery
although
i
do
like
the
eisbock
more
this
is
definitely
a
must
try
beer
im
excited
to
see
what
a
few
years
of
cellaring
will
do
to
this
baby
tastes
as
wonderful
as
it
looks
less
sweet
than
i
would
have
thought
but
still
full
of
the
great
citrus
tastes
i
smelled
slightly
sweet
malt
on
the
forward
pallet
and
then
on
the
second
sensation
the
fruit
sweetness
kicks
in
banana
cherry
what
might
be
plum
all
accompanied
by
a
slick
coating
mouthfeel
a
little
bit
sticky
though
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
at
any
stage
nor
any
hint
of
the
alcohol
content
there
is
seriously
no
alcohol
burn
at
all
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
dangerously
drinkable
even
this
was
a
very
hyped
up
beer
in
my
head
so
it
certainly
did
not
exceed
expectations
but
id
say
it
met
them
or
at
least
came
close
to
doing
so
d
relatively
drinkable
but
i
certainly
couldnt
pound
these
i
think
you
can
taste
all
of
the
8
abv
a
very
enjoyable
and
to
me
different
beer
i
cant
really
see
drinking
these
as
a
session
beer
its
more
of
a
sipper
and
two
bottles
would
be
plenty
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
give
this
a
try
just
make
sure
to
give
it
a
chance
to
warm
a
bit
as
you
go
what
a
treat
pours
a
dark
amberorangered
dark
it
started
off
with
a
decent
finger
and
a
half
head
that
slowly
dissipated
yet
maintained
a
small
head
throughout
the
smell
to
me
was
immediately
of
cloves
and
banana
i
really
nursed
this
and
agree
with
one
of
the
previous
reviewers
that
the
banana
taste
intensified
as
the
beer
warmed
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
especially
considering
the
high
abv
for
the
8
00
it
was
highly
drinkable
and
would
of
loved
to
have
a
couple
more

fronts
the
there
but
not

characteristics
are
really
a

my
one
critique
would
be
that
they
put
maybe
a
little
more
emphasis
on
the
flavor
whelm
me
just
a
bit
more
and
its
be
hands
down
one
of
my
favorites
the
mother
of
all
weizenbocks
or
doppelweizenbocks
that
is
the
drinkability
is
out

sight
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
if
only
we
could
get
sixers
of
this

very
drinkable

refreshing
and

ive
been
hovering
around
this

for
a
while

everyone
i
talk
to
raves
about

the
weizenbock
style
of
dopples
and
curiosity
got
the
better
of
me
im
a
big
fan
of
bavarian
hefes
so
i
suspected
id
like
this
one
okay
well
dang
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
the
clove
flavors
of
a
typical
bavarian
hefe
with
the
roasty
chocolaty
coffee
flavors
of
dark

this
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
brown
color
with
a
tall
off
white
head
that
recedes
very
slowly
the
aroma
makes
me
want
to
grow
their
yeast
its
got
all
of
the
nice
banana
and
clove
in
there
that
you
could
want
balanced
nicely
by
the
wheat
malt
the
taste
is
very
nice
if
a
little
sweet
with
a
lot
of
the
roasted
malt
flavors
coming
through
the
medium
body
doesnt
hold
up
to
the
high
level
of
carbonation
but
still
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
aroma
of
banana
and
dark
chocolate
one
of
the
best
dopplebocks
i
have
ever
tasted
there
is
a
rich
chocolate
maltiness
that
is
balanced
out
with
a
hints
of
banana
and
citurs
fruits
yummy
the
aroma
was
wheaty
with
some
fruit
esters
the
taste
had
a
bite
up
front
that
left
a
tingling
at
the
back
of
the
throat
it
was
wheat
filled
all
the
way
through
it
had
a
sweetness
that
turned
to
a
slightly
bitter
taste
i
got
some
bananas
on
the
back
end
of
the
drink
it
was
well
carbonated
and
was
an
enjoyable
and
tasty
beverage

wanting

impression
the
alcohol
was
quite
well
integrated
to
begin
with
but
with
warming
it
took
on
a
sherrylike
warmth
and
texture
nice
malty
impressions
some
bitter
chocolate
all
in
all
well
balanced
for
a
big
beer
this
beer
is
probably
not
for
novices
i
recall
having
it
for
the
first
time
a
bit
over
a
year
ago
and
i
was
a
little
swept
away
by
it
this
time
i
appreciated
the
unravelling
of
different
layers
of
spice
chocolate
malt
and
wheat
that
made
it
well
worth
drinking
slowly
which
i
suppose
is
warranted
with
the
large
alcohol
presence
i
could
do
with
another
of
these
highly
recommended
provided
you
dont
rush
it
along
too
much
this
is
the
best
weizenbock
ive
ever
had
and
one
of
the
best
german
beers
ive
tasted
highly
recommended
drinkability
a
very
wellcrafted
beer
more
enjoyable
than
the
original
weisse
this
weizenbock
is
a
good
hybrid
for
those
who
enjoy
wheat
beers
but
arent
over
the
moon
about
bocks
a
highly
drinkable
treat
this
beer
was
tasted
on
112408
a
500ml
bottle
out
of
a
duvel
tulip
glass
the
beer
was
bottled
on
the
109th
day
of
2008
initial
appearance
was
a
beauiful
reddishbrown
amber
colour
with
a
mouth
watering
2
finger
cream
head
unfortunately
the
smell
and
taste
did
not
compare
to
the
look
all
i
could
smell
was
active
yeast
which
overwhelmed
any
other
flavours
the
beer
might
have
had
the
taste
was
the
same
yeast
yeast
and
more
yeast
i
would
say
at
least
for
me
the
beer
is
not
very
drinkable
considering
it
was
the
first
beer
that
i
have
poured
in
a
long
time
not
a
big
fan
of
german
beer
styles
though
more
of
a
belgian
guy
so
i
hope
this
brew
will
improve
with
more
age
overall
at
this
point
of
bottle
ageing
was
very
disappointed
by
this
brew
which
is
listed
on
bas
top
100
list
aventinus
pours
with
a
big
bubbly
head
justifying
the
champagne
glassshape
of
the
prescribed
glassware
the
settled
beer
is
a
rich
amberbrown
with
excellent
lacing
the
smell
is
just
superb
its
a
spiced
fruit
cocktail
cinnamon
sticks
and
nutmeg
stewed
with
pears
apples
and
ripe
bananas
its
close
to
a
spiced
mead
without
the
syrupy
sweetness
i
appreciate
the
taste
more
than
the
related
eisbock
the
eisbock
is
great
but
the
taste
of
wheat
wine
tends
to
drown
things
out
this
beer
showcases
a
range
of
flavors
and
is
in
my
opinion
an
extremely
easy
beer
to
like
it
is
a
great
beer
to
spring
on
the
wine
crowd
because
there
is
a
lot
of
fruitiness
with
a
superb
wheat
backdrop
and
a
touch
of
the
wineish
qualities
of
the
eisbock
it
packs
complexity
and
steadiness
into
an
incredible
wheat
ale
schneider
must
have
sold
his
soul
for
the
recipe
to
this
bit
of
alchemy
it
is
a
unique
flavor
of
beer
at
least
to
my
palate
and
a
marvelous
bit
of
respite
from
the
unrelenting
onslaught
of
pale
ales
and
stouts
this
is
one
of
those
few
beers
that
i
could
drink
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
be
happy
i
love
belgians
and
gigantic
american
styles
but
the
germans
really
know
how
to
make
a
beer
that
you
could
drink
at
any
reasonable
time
and
even
at
8

i
wish
i
had
an
entire
three
liter
stein
of
it
you
give
me
three
liters
of
aventinus
and
im
willing
to
be
fairly
lax
on
the
issue
of
the
propriety
of
the
glassware
great
great
beer
thank
heaven
its
widely
available
these
days
i
love
this
beer
it
is
one
of
the
worlds
greats
overall
this
is
a
very
deceiving
doppelbock
has
the
high
alcohol
content
but
covers
it
up
with
lots
of
great
flavors
definitely
worth
trying
note
the
banana
flavours
fade
into
the
background
as
it
warms
and
are
replaced
with
a
bold
malty
taste
with
some
alcohol
two
fingers
of
head
when
poured
but
this
quickly
drops
with
some
retention
murky
brown
in
colour
aromas
of
dark
fruit
and
overwhelming
alcohol
which
persisted
on
the
palate
the
alcohol
just
wiped
out
everything
else
for
me
totally
dominant
perhaps
better
with
food
this
poured
a
hazy
dark
mahogany
with
white
head
it
smelled
like
lemon
and
wild
yeast
salt
and
vinegar
and
no
malt
it
tasted
like
prune
malt
and
sour
wild
yeast
with
lemon
and
salty
hops
it
was
watery
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
had
a
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
was
much
more
belgian
and
less
dark
lacking
malt
than
i
expected
it
was
clean
and
drinkable
but
didnt
have
a
flavor
that
i
particularly
enjoy
it
had
decent
body
and
hid
the
alcohol
fairly
well
and
will
hopefully
become
much
more
balanced
with
tasty
malt
character
as
it
ages
mouthfeel
was
zippy
at
first
but
smoothed
out
as
it
warmed
a
little
a
classicalthough
it
is
far
from
my
favorite
style
drinkability
better
out
of
the
bottle
i
think
the
flavors
just
seemed
a
little
less
vibrant
here
nonetheless
its
still
a
fantastic
beer
flavorful
aromatic
attractive
creamy
and
a
definite
winner
i
cant
recommend
this
enough
the
carbonation
when
first
poured
was
a
bit
much
but
after
it
settled
i
was
a
happy
man
this
is
one
of
the
great
weizenbocks
i
have
an
aged
one
that
i
am
eager
to
try
and
will
look
for
it
on
tap
which
should
be
interesting
d
for
the
style
very
in
sum
this
is
a
must
try
the
best
of
the
style
a
classic
and
one
of
my
favorite

this
is

ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
until
i
tried
this
one
the
aventinus
pours
a
rich
syrupy
brown
with
an
aggresive
head
that
rapidly
dissapates
the
aroma
is
all
malt
sweet
with
hints
of
toffee
and
carmel
this
beer
coats
the
palate
upon
the
first
sip
flavors
of
carmel
dates
and
malt
are
first
noticed
followed
by
a
slight
dry
finish
i
found
it
to
be
quite
easy
to
drink
despite
its
abv
and
viscosity
aventinus
is
the
best
wheat
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
one
of
the
best
german
brews
i
have
tasted
in
my
life
this
is
one
of
the
best
bock
style
beers
out
there
without
a
doubt
the
taste
is
highly
interesting
lively
and
complex
which
was
what
hit
me
before
any
specific

the

board
at

listed
this
as
a
doppelbock
so
being
that
i
was
unfamiliar
with
the
drink
and
that
i
am
particularly
keen
on
doppelbocks
i
was
fairly
surprised
when
i
recieved
it
at
the
lightness
in
color
as
well
as
the
somewhatsubdued
flavor
i
knew
then
that
this
was
probably
not
a
doppelbock
and
i
checked
ba
to
confirm
it
was
a
weizen
anyway
once
id
adjusted
to
the
beers
true
identity
i
was
ready
for
it
and
enjoyed
it
quite
a
lot
it
smells
like
rootbeer
and
looks
like
it
too
tastes
sweet
and
a
bit
like
caramel
but
very
smooth
the
sweetness
is
subdues
and
not
so
upfront
mouth
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
moderate
highly
carbonated
very
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
as
well
one
of
my
favorite
beers
hands
down
i
like
this
beer
the
first
time
i
tasted
it
so
damn
much
i
immediately
went
out
and
bought
the
attendant
glass
to
it
superior
productmasterful
as
i
sip
further
i
am
starting
to
feel
the
warming
effects
of
the
relatively
high
8
2
alcohol
this
will
be
a
nice
beer
to
bring
to
my
familys
xmas
gathering
to
keep
warm
and
to
endure
their
idiotic
banter
as
this
baby
best
german
i
can
think
of
maybe
weihenstephaner
can
come
along
on
the
german
train
as
well
d
impressive
dry
enough
to
keep
me
going
back
my
palate
loves
the
complexity

of
the
smoothest
mousseist
beers
i
have
tasted
pours
cola

a
a

with

and
is

by

and

maple

through
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish

dry
on

very
good
weizenbock
d
this
one
is
as
drinkable
as
any
good
dunkelweizen
despite
the
higher
alcohol
content
a
finer
wheat
beer
could
not
be
asked
for
overall
this
beer
was
really
good
the
taste
is
extremely
unwavering
which
makes
this
a
very
approachable
drink
for
almost
anyone
most
importantly
its
not
extreme
in
any
sense
of
the
word
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
wish
had
a
little
less
carbonation
as
i
said
before
the
more
you
let
the
carbonation
settle
the
more
the
fruit
and
flavor
are
prolonged
when
consumed
i
may
store
my
other
bottle
for
a
while
to
see
how
it
affects
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
colour
with
thin
whiteish
head
smell
wheat
malts
with
hint
of
frutiness
taste
its
great
wheat
plums
and
raisins
with
hint
of
chocolate
its
really
complex
and
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
there
beer
is
very
balanced
and
very
drincable
for
the
abv
fantastic
brew
i
will
definately
go
back
to
it
the
beer
is
somewhat
thick
but
very
wet
and
carbonated
almost
like
a
soda
very
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
im
thinking
that
5
years
of
aging
this
brew
is
ideal
for
my
tastes
i
still
have
a
line
on
getting
more
of
these
2003
limited
editions
and
i
think
i
will
also
this
beer
greatly
benefits
from
its
official
glassware
pilsner
with
a
rounded
top
as
you
bring
it
to
your
lips
the
bubble
near
the
top
of
the
glass
nicely
captures
all
of
this
brews
aromas
just
bought
the
glass
today
and
i
notice
the
difference
d
this
drinks
very
well
especially
on
a
fall
night
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
this
and
it
is
even
better
than
i
remember
2
29ea
the
nicely
carbonated
and
fullbodied
silky
character
makes
this
one
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
had
a
bottle
of
it
at
moan
and
dove
a
great
appearance
generally
dark
with
a
murky
brown
tone
in
the
light
and
a
wonderfully
thick
head
fantastic
aromas
of
dark
fruits
wrapped
in
a
roasty
and
yeasty
flavor
the
taste
was
really
sweet
with
the
bready
and
fruit
aspects
really
coming
through
slightly
silky
in
texture
but
generally
light
overall
this
was
really
great
great
beer
for
the
stylenot
usually
a
huge
fan
of
the
fruitiness
of
wheat
beers
but
i
like
this
one
d
ridiculously
good
beer
one
of
the
best
for
a
high
abv
and
high
malt
content
lover
like
me
i
think
my
love
of
scotch
has
influenced
my
taste
in
beer
i
like
to
feel
a
little
heat
after
the
swallow
i
make
fun
of
people
who
drink
light
or
even
worse
ultralight
beer
i
often
share
with
them
the
estimated
calorie
content
of
a
boozy
malt
bomb
like
this
one
roughly
300400
i
guessing
no
wonder
german
monks
invented
doppelbocks
to
get
them
through
the
lenten
fasting
periods
its
liquid
food
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
mfd
a
great
beer
experience
if
you
have
not
tried
this
beer
you
should
a
classic
just
be
aware
of
the
8
abv
a
very
very
good
wheat
beer
the
only
limiting
factor
is
the
8
abv
a
little
aggressive
carbonation
on
the
tongue
at
first
but
it
smoothes
out
later
on
2004
vintage
bottle
aged
at
schneider
pours
clearish
mahogany
with
a
surprisingly
small
offwhite
head
recedes
quickly
without
much
lacing
strong
almost
overpowering
darkfruity
smell
prunes
and
molasses
strong
fruit
in
the
taste
as
well
with
some
tangy
wheat
very
sweet
with
a
fair
amount
of
banana
slight
alcohol
flavor
and
warmth
highly
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
a
bit
too
much
edit
i
love
this
more
and
more
every
time
i
have
it
this
is
the
only
perfect
beer
ive
ever
had
d
very
easy
to
finish
the
bottle
a
great
summer
beer
something
ill
be
sure
to
have
again
my
first
wizenbock
i
think
i
need
to
further
explore
this
style
the
best
beer
i
probably
drank
out
of
the
5
i
had
at
the
fest
so
i
could
drank
it
for
a
minute
or
two
overall
a
very
nice
and
complex
beer
i
was
surprised
at
how
yeasty
this
was
but
nonetheless
it
is
a
great
beer
for
sure
good
beer
high
alcohol
content
sneaks
up
on
you
a
winner
here
evokes
both
hefeweizen
and
dark
belgian
ales
a
wellbalanced
beer
with
flavor
and
drinkability
ill
pick
this
up
again
if
i
see
it
d
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
the
only
weizenbock
ive
ever
enjoyed
d
this
is
a
great
beer
but
not
my
favorite
weizenbock
i
appreciated
the
deep
color
and
complexity
but
thought
it
was
a
bit
too
heavy
to
be
a
refreshing
beer
overall
i
like
it
i
have
enjoyed
a
lot
of
schneider
beers
before
would
drink
again
i
would
really
consider
aging
this
a
bit
to
see
if
that
would
take
the
edge
off
the
alcohol
d
not
an
everyday
beer
d
a
most
enjoyable
here
too
i
can
taste
the
history
as
i
drink
it
nothing
sessionable
at
all
about
this
beer
but
man
it
is
tasty
a
real
gem
quite
surprised
i
have
never
tried
this
one
have
to
say
its
delicious
definitely
deserving
of
all
the
praise
will
be
looking
forward
to
the
next
offering
d
easy
to
drink
but
is
on
the
sweeter
side
of
things
overall
all
around
good
stuff
worth
a
try
fantastic
drinkability
just
a
bit
heavy
on
the
warmth
i
love
the
abv
i
just
dont
like
the
raw
taste
of
alcohol
this
isnt
bad
at
all
but
there
is
enough
there
that
it
wasnt
perfect
for
my
taste
however
it
was
still
very
good
and
i
highly
recommend
it
for
the
style
this
one
is
a
must
try
for
a
weizenbock
fan
well
made
those
freaking
germans
danke
d
good
drinkability
for
style
i
had
about
15
to
taste
this
night
and
this
by
far
was
my
favorite
drinkability
complexity
and
ease
give
this
one
a
high

watch
out
for
the
abv
but
other
than
that

pour
into
a
glass
really
interesting
dark

found
that
it
had

but

i
wouldnt
buy
again
for
a
few
years
until
i
can
train
my
self
on
dopplebock
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
its
like
nothing
else
ive
ever
tasted
notes
for
the
price
and
the
flavor
this
is
a
homerun
a
good
beer
all
around
and
no
fridge
is
complete
without
one
more
than
worth
a
taste
worth
two
tastes
if
you
like
the

by

and
can
appreciate
a
sipping
beer
you
will
like
aventinus
for
sure
definitely
the
most
substantive
of
weizenbocks

have

alcohol
content
i
would
enjoy
two
at
one
sitting
i
gotta
go
average
here
this
beer
hasnt
done
much
to
awe
me
its
a
decent
beer
but
im
not
getting
the
part
thats
going
to
being
me
back
to
it
unless
im
in
germany
d
this
beer
has
a
strong
taste
but
its
mainly
yeastiness
if
there
was
something
more
complex
it
would
be
delicious
but
as
it
is
its
hard
to
justify
such
a
deliciousness
this
was
a
very
good
place
to
start
for
my
first
weizenbock
very
good
beer
worthy
of
the
praise
d
a
nice
beer
for
sure
not
something
id
drink
often
but
once
in
a
while
wouldnt
be
bad
pretty
darn
good
beer
not
for
everyday
use
but
a
nice
change
from
the
ordinary
thanks
bob
wonderful
beer
with
a
lackluster
appearance
muddy
interesting
color
is
deep
amber
with
a
touch
of
violet
thin
head
disappeared
instantly
smell
is
delicious
dark
fruit
bubblegum
wheaty
freshness
the
taste
is
killin
a
tremendous
blast
of
fruit
creamy
malt
and
zesty
hops
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
superb
this
is
the
most
belgiantasting
german
beer
ive
had
reminds
me
of
chimay
grande
reserve
d
may
be
too
fruity
and
sweet
for
me
im
a
savory
kind
of
guy
seemed
belgian
like
chimay
or
trois
pistoles
which
kinda
threw
me
off
much
different
compared
to
the
few
other
bocks
ive
had
pours
a
dark
brown
with
huge
head
leaves
wonderful
lacing
smelll
is
full
of
malt
and
wheat
sweetness
the
taste
has
hints
of
fruit
and
even
some
chocolate
there
is
a
large
amount
of
sweetness
in
the
taste
but
i
think
it
makes
this
a
really
nice
drink
the
mouthfeel
has
lots
of
body
this
was
the
beer
that
i
drink
when
i
want
something
familar
but
i
always
enjoy
having
one
also
had
on
draught
which
is
excellent
excellent
for
a
coolweather
wheat
beer
a
celebratory
treat
or
just
whenever
for
lovers
of
big
malty
beers
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
german
beers
and
one
i
often
share
with
friends
just
beginning
to
discover
the
world
of
fine
beers
always
good
when
served
at
just
the
right
time
this
beer
is
incredible
drinkability
a
very
good
weizenbock
beer
very
complex
and
sophisticated
d
fine
can
mix
with
plenty
of
dishes
would
recommend
pours
a
very
cloudy
light
brown
thin
light
head
dissipates
quickly
with
little
lacing
the
cloudiness
makes
the
color
fascinating
smell
is
fantastic
i
can
tell
this
is
going
to
be
a
great
wheat
taste
is
amazing
complex
with
spiciness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
it
has
all
the
spiciness
and
drinkability
of
a
traditional
hefeweizen
but
packs
a
bigger
punch
the
taste
seems
to
go
on
forever
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
you
could
drink
all
night
pricey
but
delicious
d
this
is
a
good
beer
only
my
second
weizenbock
it
didnt
seem
as
flavorful
as
averys
thirteen
but
it
is
still
good
holy
schlamoly
batman
what
a
fantastic
brew
i
see
that
this
beer
is
well
reviewed
but
i
have
never
seen
it
in
north
texas
so
i
had
ungespundet
send
me
a
bottle
staight
from
bavaria
pours
out
of
the
bottle
a
cloudy
dark
brew
with
a
good
head
that
faded
to
a
small
one
fast
the
smell
was
absolutly
fantastic
malt
fruit
spice
all
rolled
into
one
i
never
had
a
better
tasting
beer
all
the
flavors
are
so
well
balanced
every
sip
this
beer
gets
better
and
better
it
goes
without
saying
this
beer
is
the
worlds
best
weizenbock
but
it
may
just
be
the
worlds
best
beer
i
like
it
so
much
i
am
going
to
visit
the
brewery
next
week
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
good
stuff
500
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
schneider
weisse
weizen
glass
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
the
appearance
is
of
dark
honey
brown
slightly
cloudy
the
smell
is
spicy
with
raisins
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
also
spicy
with
raisins
alcohol
but
also
some
banana
and
caramel
with
some
slight
bitterness
in
the
back
mouthfeel
is
smooth
velvety
this
is
a
very
good
beer
rich
and
complex
ill
definitely
buy
again
schneider
makes
my
favorite
wheat
beers
through
and
through
this
is
as
good
as
they
do
one
of
my
favorite
doppelbocks
capping
my
personal
trilogy
of
schneiders
available
at
bottle
king
i
saved
the
richest
for
last
deep
purple
mahogany
body
with
a
tremendous
lasting
headthe
doppel
effect
is
clearly
noticed
notes
of
perfume
flowers
grapes
and
cassiscomplex
medium
to
full
body
with
a
soft
finish
alcohol
is
only
hinted
at
a
slight
wine
burn
bubbles
form
gently
around
tongue
moderate
to
heavy
acidic
pressure
strong
winish
presence
overall
a
confounding
creationa
dark
wheat
abbey
that
really
comes
on
like
a
merlot
the
head
adds
flavor
throughout
the
evening
and
suddenly
like
a
wine
you
realize
how
sneaky
quick
the
good
feeling
of
this
brew
is
upon
you
nicely
done
this
probably
doesnt
come
as
a
surprise
to
me
since
their
stronger
eisbock
version
is
one
of
my
favorites
believe
the
hype
behind
this
one
enjoy
this
on
a
cool
night
to
fullfill
the
warming
effect
at
its
best
i
just
love
this
beer
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
with
the
wheat
quite
noticeable
the
taste
is
sweet
and
floral

also
some
ester
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
the
carbonation
is
apparent
overall
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
easy
drinking
brew
d
if
this
beer
was
slightly
less
carbonated
id
have
to
say
it
was
an
awesome
very
drinkable
beer
while
the
alcohol
level
is
pretty
high
the
smooth
malts
and
the
banana
esters
make
it
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
hiding
the
alcohol
from
the
palate
definitely
a
good
brew
had
this
from
the
bottle
at
emerald
coast
brew
fest
in
pensacola
fl
poured
an
attractive
caramelbrown
color
had
a
nice
white
head
that
hung
around
a
while
aroma
is
sweet
possibly
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
flavor
is
sweet
up
front
but
finishes
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
note
mouthfeel
is
good
drinkability
is
high
for
a
beer
with
an
abv
north
of
8
my
first
weizenbock
overall
a
classic
example
of
the
style
and
a
brew
i
admittedly
overlook
when
searching
for
a
sweet
rich
brew
after
this
time
around
i
dont
see
that
happening
again
recommended
m
highly
carbonated
which
is
probably
why
it
seems
so
light
for
such
a
dark
rich
bock
mediumbodied
not
syrupy
despite
the
sweetness
very
easily
drinkable
with
a
wellhidden
abv
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
especially
with
a
nice
mild
grilled
steak
pours
a
very
dark
brown
copper
color
with
a
nice
head
that
leave
little
lacing
spicy
and
fruity
aroma
flavor
is
quite
complex
toasted
malt
and
fruit
spicy
and
banana
wheat
flavors
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
a
nice
lingering
sweet
taste
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
stuff
and
a
really
excellent
wheat
beer
overall
this
is
the
first
wheat
doppelbock
i
have
had
before
it
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
it
also
has
a
full
body
of
chocolate
fruit
and
spices
in
the
palate
uniquely
enough
it
has
a
very
clovelike
finish
this
beer
is
rated
high
for
a
reason
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
goes
especially
well
with
brie
with
this
ale
it
definately
hits
above
its
weight
go
get
some
now
delciously
smooth
lucious
body
mdheavy
carbonation
and
md
liquid
this
one
just
may
have
made
it
to
my
top
10
list
its
a
short
list
overall
i
live
in
alabama
the
taste
is
equally
scrumptious
a
handful
of
flavors
rolling
around
each
other
in
perfect
balance
there
are
spices
of
pepper
and
clove
faint
apple
and
banana
through
the
finish
faint
chocolate
some
brown
sugar
and
raisin
its
hard
to
pick
out
because
they
are
so
well
infused
the
body
is
pretty
full
warming
8
really
just
enough
carbonation
in
all
its
nicely
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
had
very
good
well
worth
the
reputation
and
for
what
its
worth
very
much
recommended
at
8
2
it
is
very
drinkable
but
i
cant
help
the
feeling
that
i
wont
be
in
a
hurry
to
pick
up
this
beer
at
the
store
again
d
this
beer
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
amazingly
drinkable
given
its
balance
and
smooth
character
just
one
of
the
best
brews
not
just
doppelbock
around
this
is
my
first
crack
at
a
weizenbock
and
it
is
very
good
d
i
cant
wait
for
it
to
get
cold
here
this
is
a
great
cold
weather
beer
if
you
are
ever
tempted
to
partake
of
several
hg
beers
this
is
the
beer
long
live
the
weisses
brauhaus
enjoyed
every
ounce
cant
wait
to
get
another
hazy
brown
in
the
middle
and
lighter
on
the
outside
nice
little
head
that
goes
away
quickly
and
leaves
little
lace
smells
of
clove
banana
a
little
malt
and
a
little
dried
fruit
not
overpowering
and
nicely
blended
tastes
the
same
not
overboard
luxurious
great
mouthfeel
easy
drink
best
ive
had
in
this
style
hands
down
drinkability
a
very
refreshing
beer
alcohol
is
high
but
well
disguised
in
this
beer
the
clovebananas
character
can
make
this
beer
hard
to
really
session
on
since
it
quickly
loses
the
refreshing
crispness
of
a
traditional
wheat
beer
very
filling
and
better
for
a
nice
autumn
refresher
this
beer
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
is
easily
one
of
my
favorites
its
drinkability
is
topnotch
and
is
really
a
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
year
round
with
anything
chilled
and
poured
into
big
weizen
glass
nice
one
finger
foamy
off
white
head
with
decent
retention
but
a
little
on
the
week
side
the
body
is
clowdy
and
rich
milk
chocolate
caramel
brown
color
very
opaque
murky
with
tones
of
green
apple
around
the
base
and
surface
of
the
mass
smell
is
classic
and
very
aromatic
with
lots
of
banana
nut
bread
hints
of
spice
and
fruit
from
yeast
not
exactly
fermentation
temps
hops
are
not
very
present
in
the
aroma
the
yeast
backed
by
malt
are
really
the
showcase
of
this
beer
flavor
is
very
rich
and
malt
forward
hops
are
are
not
very
present
in
the
flavor
other
than
a
contribution
of
bitterness
yeast
has
played
quit
a
large
role
in
shaping
the
taste
of
this
beer
which
is
very
nice
as
mentioned
in
the
smell
clover
banana
nut
bread
with
a
touch
of
sourness
toward
the
finish
the
abv
is
strong
but
still
at
a
very
drinkable
level
this
is
a
totally
quaffable
beer
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
aged
this
one
for
6
months
highly
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
this
is
a
true
any
time
kind
of
beer
pours
with
a
big
head
that
eventually
comes
to
rest
but
still
lasts
till
the
end
a
beautiful
light
rusty
brown
colour
smells
of
malts
cloves
fruits
raisins
bananas
and
alcohol
has
a
lovely
palate
malty
fruity
and
a
nice
warming
alcohol
profile
also
fairly
sour
on
the
finish
a
true
champion
of
complexity
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
and
would
recommend
this
to
friends
a
dark
n
delicious
beauty
of
a
beer
boasting
an
incredibly
rich
nutty
flavor
with
strong
hints
of
spice
cinnamon
and
clove
come
immediately
to
my
senses
with
a
sweet
aroma
and
a
silken
mouthfeel
akin
to
what
might
be
a
sort
of
liquid
velvet
the
thick
and
longevitous
head
comprised
of
fine
bubbles
tops
off
what
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
experience
so
spicy
she
is
that
this
would
not
be
a
beer
i
drink
in
robust
quantity
rather
one
to
savor
and
let
linger
on
the
palate
while
the
ripe
fruity
scents
waft
up
to
the
nose
and
prelude
the
slightly
bitter
ever
so
smooth
finish
fit
for
kings
great
drinkability
abv
may
limit
some
the
taste
is
so
welcoming
pours
cloudy
and
brown
with
a
good
sized
head
of
fine
bubbles
aroma
has
strong
notes
of
vanilla
dark
cherry
and
light
clove
some
alcohol
present
in
the
nose
as
well
flavor
displays
chewy
melanoidin
richness
with
an
underlying
fruity
character
and
a
light
tanginess
as
well
a
classic
example
of
a
good
weizenbock
from
a
well
respected
german
weissbier
brewery
recommended
d
this
is
very
drinkable
i
will
be
getting
this
one
again
a
bit
hearty
to
drink
this
one
all
night
and
eventually
you
want
to
switch
to
something
different
but
to
its
credit
you
can
start
or
finish
your
night
with
this
one
and
be
equally
satisfied
such
a
great
combination
of
refreshment
and
flavor
a
true
great
i
tried
this
beer
on
july
5
2007
after
purchasing
it
from
my
local
lcbo
store
it
poured
a
dark
thick
brownish
colour
into
the
glass
with
a
large
loose
head
that
dissipated
quite
slowly
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
malt
and
wheat
tones
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
hints
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
also
thick
with
hints
of
malt
and
yeast
i
think
this
is
my
first
weizenbock
and
since
it
is
a
top
100
beer
i
had
to
buy
it
i
poured
this
into
a
weizen
glass
duh
and
the
head
was
aggressively
foamy
and
cream
colored
the
actual
beer
is
dark
cloudy
brown
with
red
at
the
bottom
and
edges
it
smells
very
yeasty
cloves
and
spice
tastes
like
spice
clove
yeast
wheatsome
chocolate
barely
and
some
dark
fruit
little
apricot
which
i
havent
had
in
years
alcohol
was
unnoticeable
but
the
phenols
were
certainly
there
good
stuff
pours
deep
brown
with
an
excellent
cream
colored
head
this
brew
smells
of
sweet
fruits
the
taste
is
also
of
sweet
fruit
namely
dried
apricot
and
darker
fruit
it
is
highly
carbonated
with
an
average
viscosity
it
is
fairly
drinkable
however
it
just
isnt
my
style
the
taste
really
doesnt
do
it
for
me
poured
slightly
cloudy
wood
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
good
retenetion
thin
but
steady
lace
spicy
yeast
aroma
with
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
first
taste
is
peppery
and
spicey
like
a
hefe
with
a
bit
of
citrus
later
the
roasted
malt
and
some
nuttiness
comes
through
complex
flavor
yet
still
well
balanced
clean
and
fruity
dry
finish
no
lingering
aftertaste
you
would
never
know
it
is
a
strong
8
beer
pricey
but
a
gem
drinkability
the
ease
that
this
went
down
is
both
its
strength
and
its
weakness
i
could
very
easily
down
another
of
these
with
great
ease
the
depth
of
this
beer
makes
it
one
of
my
favorate
weizenbocks
not
quite
as
refreshing
as
a
hefe
and
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
weizenbocks
to
compare
this
to
but
this
is
a
world
class
brew
served
in
a
weizen
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
huge
fluffy
offwhite
head
it
smells
like
plums
bananas
cloves
and
some
lemon
overall
its
a
sweet
and
spicy
smelling
beer
but
the
aroma
isnt
overpowering
but
still
good
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
aroma
but
i
can
also
taste
some
bubblegum
caramel
and
wheatyeast
luckily
the
taste
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
is
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
the
carbonation
works
in
this
beer
very
well
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
is
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
considering
its
8
2
abv
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
im
impressed
with
it
looks
and
tastes
great
ill
buy
it
again
d
overall
this
was
fantastic
drinkability
superb
and
definatly
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
would
put
this
up
against
and
belgian
any
day
really
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
cannot
wait
until
the
distributor
gets
this
in
around
here
i
have
already
cleared
a
spot
in
the
fridge
for
it
poured
a
dark
amberish
brown
nice
near
white
head
three
fingers
then
fading
to
one
then
to
none
smell
is
great
spicy
and
sweet
some
lemon
and
banana
in
there
taste
follows
smell
pretty
closely
definitely
full
of
flavor
for
sure
spicy
fruits
again
and
even
some
hints
of
caramel
malts
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
though
lacking
a
little
carbonation
still
very
very
refreshing
drinkability
is
pretty
scary
says
8
2
on
the
label
but
i
dont
detect
that
at
all
enjoyable
brew
after
burning
up
on
the
golf
course
not
sure
why
ive
never
picked
this
up
its
well
worth
it
definitely
a
classy
beer
enjoy
d
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
the
only
thing
that
didnt
agree
with
me
so
much
is
the
very
apparent
alcohol
smell
id
still
recommend
this
beer
to
be
had
seasonally
as
it
is
very
enjoyable
but
probably
not
in
every
setting
very
nice
brew
high
drinkability
could
be
dangerous
definately
one
of
my
favorites
blends
together
well
and
rolls
off
very
well
in
the
month
i
have
used
this
beer
many
times
to
introduce
friends
to
beer
outside
the
package
store
overall
a
truly
well
done
beer
very
tasty
and
highly
recommended
highly
recommended
a
true
classic
what
do
you
say
about
aventinus
this
is
easily
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
brews
im
rating
this
one
based
on
the
bottle
but
ive
also
had
it
on
draft
in
the
states
and
germany
and
theres
not
a
big
difference
between
any
of
them
they
are
all
worldclass
when
fresh
this
would
easily
be
one
of
my
five
desert
island
brews
i
used
to
enjoy
many
other
germanstyle
hefeweizens
but
aventinus
has
killed
my
enjoyment
of
most
other
regular
hefes
ive
had
the
aventinus
eisbock
on
several
occasions
as
well
but
i
enjoy
this
version
the
most
this
has
an
incredible
mixture
of
the
classic
german
wheat
beer
flavors
while
condensing
them
yet
not
overdoing
them
the
spicy
clovey
phenolics
are
in
perfect
harmony
here
this
brew
sets
the
standard
for
all
other
darkish
weizenbocks
waytogo
schneider
please
dont
ever
change
this
one
nor
stop
brewing
it
drinkability
dangerous
one
here
smooth
and
clean
oelergud
taste
is
full
of
the
typical
weiss
flavours
only
taken
to
the
next
level
of
intensity
banana
pear
clove
nuts
caramel
vanilla
coriander
all
combined
in
a
liquid
bread
experience
wow
is
the
word
here
body
is
good
and
thick
and
heavy
but
a
little
more
carbonated
than
i
might
like
a
mild
quibble
this
is
so
drinkable
for
the
strength
but
a
little
dangerous
because
of
it
i
love
this
style
even
though
ive
only
had
two
examples
in
my
life
a
wonderful
spring
brew
based
on
what
i
have
read
about
this
style
this
beer
sounds
like
a
great
style
example
but
as
i
found
this
is
not
my
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
aggressive
pour
yielded
lots
of
head
creamy
but
noticeable
carbonation
took
longer
than
i
expected
for
it
to
settle
leaving
light
lace
dark
amber
and
cloudy
in
appearance
sweet
aroma
in
the
nose
familiar
yeast
taste
of
a
wheat
beer
but
with
more
sweet
malt
accompanying
it
hops
and
alcohol
are
present
at
the
back
yeast
forward
malt
middle
slight
alcohol
at
the
end
very
drinkable
especially
at
8
will
definitely
have
this
again
what
a
terrific
beer
highly
recommended
couldnt
believe
i
hadnt
reviewed
this
yet
its
widely
available
at
better
beer
stores
and
ive
loved
it
since
the
first
one
huge
wheat
beer
no
lack
of
flavor
incredible
brewing
technique
results
in
an
unfiltered
top
fermented
bockbeer
of
absolutely
world
class
overall
i
love
it
and
i
will
continue
to
drink
it
d
a
delicious
mixture
of
exceptional
aromas
and
flavors
coupled
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
to
die
for
d
stunned
its
8
goes
down
very
easily
very
smooth
excellent
beer
especially
on
tap
overall
very
nice
just
not
my
favourite
style
drinkability
either
way
one
nice
and
slow
or
a
massive
stein
to
quench
your
thirst
appetite
and
mind
this
beer
is
a
true
gem
i
think
reguardless
of
personal
preference
everyone
will
enjoy
a
bottle
of
this
beer
overall
i
recommend
this
the
flavor
is
very
distinctawsome
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
laden
with
yeast
and
some
crisp
carbonation
even
at
8
abv
its
as
poundable
as
any
wheat
beer
on
earth
love
the
purple
label
makes
the
bottle
stick
out
on
a
shelf
this
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
slightly
off
white
head
that
just
billows
in
my
hefe
glass
just
from
the
16
9
oz
bottle
it
felt
like
i
had
to
do
a
guinness
pour
just
to
get
the
whole
damn
bottle
in
the
glass
good
off
the
bat
the
smell
has
a
whisk
of
alcohol
to
it
already
and
this
is
dead
bock
cold
and
it
shows
in
the
taste
right
after
the
immediate
sip
is
taken
has
alot
of
character
to
it
underneath
though
its
just
the
alcohol
masks
it
fairly
heavily
unfortunately
absolutely
love
the
wheat
influence
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
and
makes
for
an
interesting
mix
of
wheat
ale
character
and
bock
sweetness
a
very
interesting
beer
however
not
my
style
well
not
yet
at
least
i
recommend
it
as
something
every
ba
should
try
this
beer
has
a
deep
brown
opaque
color
it
has
strong
fruit
smell
particular
bananas
and
some
slight
prune
overtones
the
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
but
that
is
balanced
with
the
strong
banana
flavor
it
was
served
ontap
with
a
slight
head
that
left
moderate
lacing
that
did
not
stay
long
the
taste
is
sweet
through
and
through
giving
it
a
balanced
flavor
it
has
a
smooth
taste
and
finish
an
excellent
ontap
selection
d
worth
a
few
numbers
around
the
dance
floor
until
you
need
to
take
a
cab
home
this
girl
can
dance
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
the
color
is
a
nice
deep
dark
amber
that
has
about
1
finger
worth
of
head
to
start
but
that
disappears
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
as
well
the
smell
is
dominated
by
clove
and
banana
with
a
slight
roasted
character
as
well
the
taste
is
huge
on
banana
the
spicy
clove
character
as
well
and
the
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
citrusy
a
perfect
dessert
beer
this
is
a
well
carbonated
beer
but
a
little
more
creaminess
and
this
would
be
better
off
this
beer
is
absolutely
delicious
a
wonderful
example
of
what
this
style
and
beer
in
general
should
strive
to
be
highest
recommendation
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
over
the
years
both
in
the
us
and
in
germany
it
is
the
epitome
of
the
style
weizenbock
in
my
humble
opinion
there
is
none
better
d
less
drinkable
than
a
hefeweizen
more
drinkable
than
a
doppelbock
imagine
that
wish
there
was
a
4
25
for
this
category
but
gave
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
i
personally
wouldnt
throw
back
a
bunch
of
these
too
sweet
and
too
much
alcohol
but
a
pleasant
to
drink
big
wheat
beer
overall
a
dunkelweizen
bock
first
ive
tried
and
its
damned
good
a
good
example
of
a
sort
of
offthewall
style
and
a
musttry
for
even
the
mildly
obsessive
completist
drinkability
is
limited
only
by
availability
bank
account
balance
and
alcohol
tolerance
strange
that
the
eisbock
is
available
in
kansas
but
not
this
better
original
this
is
one
of
the
first
beers
i
grab
when
visiting
kc
to
bring
back
here
not
my
favorite
but
still
among
the
musthaves
d
very
tasty
beer
could
be
a
benchmark
for
the
style
i
like
the
different
it
brings
to
beer
community
drinkability
sipper
type
of
beer
enjoyable
very
good
stuff
a
treat
to
say
the
least
the
clove
and
spice
is
just
right
for
me
the
malt
flavour
is
not
overly
wheaty
but
it
is
outstanding
what
can
be
said
about
aventinus
that
hasnt
been
said
before
this
beer
is
is
what
beer
should
be
if
you
have
never
had
this
before
do
your
self
a
favor
and
find
it
immediately
enjoy
ever
last
bit
of
it
as
if
its
your
last
its
really
that
good
poured
from
a
half
liter
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
dark
brown
with
a
thick
head
that
reduces
down
to
some
wisps
and
a
bank
around
the
rim
smells
sweet
with
a
little
spice
tastes
rich
and
malty
with
that
wheat
taste
in
the
back
the
mouthfeel
is
amazing
thick
and
solid
with
a
lingering
savory
finish
i
want
to
know
why
i
dont
drink
this
more
often
pours
dark
chestnut
with
a
thin
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
the
smell
is
of
wheat
that
is
reminiscent
of
wasa
crackers
with
a
sweet
rounded
malt
and
a
nice
yeastiness
beautifully
balanced
flavor
of
alcohol
malt
prunes
figs
cereal
grain
and
a
touch
of
cellared
apples
very
creamy
and
with
a
medium
body
that
is
just
right
to
support
the
alcohol
and
flavors
extremely
drinkable
just
the
perfect
thing
for
a
spring
day
ive
tasted
more
complex
beers
but
this
one
is
still
pretty
good
and
pretty
drinkable
i
have
to
wonder
what
some
aging
would
do
d
drinkable
but
not
special
fruity
but
boring
d
extremely
drinkable
i
really
love
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
i
want
to
get
some
more
tonight
hmmm
lets
do
it
pours
an
almost
inky
black
with
a
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
nothing
smells
sweet
with
fruits
like
grapes
and
a
sharp
note
in
the
background
the
smell
definitely
gives
away
its
wheat
nature
the
taste
has
more
roast
than
the
smell
with
an
almost
charcoallike
bit
up
front
but
not
in
a
bad
way
if
that
makes
sense
the
sweetness
comes
through
next
with
a
bit
of
fruit
but
then
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
includes
a
healthy
carbonation
followed
by
a
viscous
oily
feel
very
nice
indeed
the
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
one
that
just
cries
out
for
a
patio
some
shade
and
a
sunny
but
cool
breezey
afternoon
whos
ready
to
move
to
munich
wow
what
a
fantastic
beer
i
have
had
this
in
the
past
but
i
marvel
at
it
every
time
this
is
a
real
buttkicker
and
pairs
really
well
with
boratta
i
was
introduced
to
this
beer
back
in
1998
and
have
never
looked
back
if
the
world
was
left
with
only
5
beers
i
would
hope
this
would
be
one
of
them
drinkability
fantastic
wish
i
had
one
more
bottle
to
enjoy
its
a
very
drinkable
wheat
that
may
be
one
of
the
best
ive
tasted
cant
beat

a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
some
copper
hues
on
the
sides
thick
off
white
foamy
head
which
holds
together
very
well
fruity
spicy
and
bannana
notes
in
the
nose
a
whiff
of
darker
fruit
follows
in
the
background
a
bit
of
chocolate
up

followed
by
dark
fruit
finishes
with
a
bit
of

and
spice
warming
alcohol
presence
nice
fruity
flavors
with
just
a
bit
of
tartness
medium
body
and
spritzy
very
hearty
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
solid
beer
an
excellent
decadent
sipper
great
for
a
winter
night
or
to
sustain
onself
throughout
lent
also
a
truely
great
example
of
a
wheat
beer
and
how
wheat
beers
can
be
as
rich
and
full
in
flavour
as
any
all
barley
brews
best
wheat
beer
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
yet
highly
recommended
d
this
is
an
amazing
beer
might
have
just
made
it
up
to
one
of
my
top
beers
before
i
say
that
i
want
to
have
it
a
few
more
times
but
i
am
sure
that
will
happen
very
shortly
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
certainly
a
goto
when
wanting
a
beer
that
makes
you
think
how
great
this
bubbly
beverage
that
is
called
beer
is
though
it
was
an
obvious
guess
i
didnt
believe
it
before
i
tried
it
it
really
tastes
and
smells
like
something
of
a
cross
between
a
weissbier
and
a
doppelbock
very
unique
and
i
really
enjoy
it
certainly
a
beer
to
get
again
from
time
to
time
and
definitely
something
that
everyone
should
try
would
make
a
nice
dinner
beer
to
say
the
least
but
a
bit
too
sweet
and
strong
to
pound
more
than
1
or
2
in
a
sitting
d
drinkability
overall
is
good
soft
yet
crisp
mouthfeel
makes
this
feel
almost
like
a
session
brew
however
the
high
abv
limits
it
i
almost
wish
it
felt
more
like
a
sipping
beer
either
way
its
damn
good
benchmark
for
the
style
this
is
definitely
a
beer
ill
be
drinking
again
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
my
aventinus
glass
appears
a
deep
dark
mahogany
with
a
finger
of
tan
creamy
foam
smells
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
dried
cherries
taste
is
very
malty
with
notes
of
raisin
chocolate
molasses
and
a
touch
of
banana
very
complex
full
bodied
and
really
rich
a
very
satisfying
beer
always
a
classic
in
my
eyes
highly
recommended
this
is
a
great
beer
and
worthy
of
being
at
the
top
of
its
style
but
it
leaves
me
wishing
for
a
bit
more
perhaps
im
spoiled
having
such
access
to
a
beer
like
this
or
perhaps
its
just
has
qualities
that
are
inherent
to
the
style
that
i
wish
it
didnt
probably
a
combination
of
both
i
really
like
this
beer
though
i
just
dont
love
it
this
brew
is
dangerously
drinkable
as
its
difficult
to
notice
youre
drinking
a
highalcohol
content
beverage
unless
youve
read
the
label
use
caution

the
aroma
with

banana

just
a
hint
of
cloves
on
the
tounge
creamy
mouthfeel
that
isnt
sticky
or
syrupy
at
all
imo
alcohol
is
also
barely
noticeable
best
as
i
can
tell
this
beer
is
great
like
a
hef
only
more
complex
tasty
and
satisfying
superb
i
can
see
this
beer
having
a
regular
place
in
my
dbf
cheers
taste
is
fenolic
and
dry
with
some
exotic
fruits
ripe
bananas
most
of
all
the
wheat
is
very
apparent
and
makes
the
beer
very
mild
and
gives
a
very
soft
mouthfeel
body
is
full
but
very
drinkable
a
good
decent
weizenbock
with
a
good
balance
mouthfeel
very
fizzy
carbonation
lots
of
bubbles
some
tart
dryness
in
the
finish
taste
is
very
much
hefeweizen
crisp
and
refreshing
with
more
caramelized
roasty
maltedness
on
the
midpalate
and
the
finish
when
the
tart
tannins
come
in
some
dry
cocoa
and
plum
flavors
next
cloves
lots
of
longlasting
cloves
and
cinnamonsugar
toast
are
the
really
nice
flavors
in
the
finish
to
me
that
palatesmacking
tannic
finish
detracts
from
the
drinkability
just
a
bitits
just
very
very
dry
i
can
easily
believe
that
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
this
style
very
happy
to
try
it
and
i
will
jump
at
the
chance
to
order
this
on
tap
if
the
opportunity
ever
presents
itself
really
complex
brew
with
a
lot
going
on
pours
a
dark
cloudy
brown
with
a
hint
of
amber
has
a
huge
tan
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
leaves
great
lacing
aroma
and
taste
are
both
sweet
wheaty
and
almost
spicy
hints
of
banana
are
present
in
the
taste
as
well
mediumbodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
sweetness
of
this
may
be
too
much
to
drink
a
six
pack
of
but
its
something
youll
want
to
sip
and
savior
anyway
i
could
guzzle
this
all
night
long
and
i
have
in
fact
gotten
into
trouble
with
it
a
few
times
because
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
i
want
to
savor
it
and
yet
i
cant
get
enough
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
on
earth
this
was
my
first
weizenbock
had
it
a
pazzos
in
lexington
pours
a
nice
looking
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
head
smells
much
like
a
hefe
but
one
that
was
injected
with
alcohol
normal
bannanas
and
citric
sweetness
taste
much
the
same
but
lots
of
heat
on
this
one
mild
chocolate
as
it
warms
overall
very
interesting
but
i
thought
the
alcohol
over
powered
this
brew
a
bit
much
for
me
d
very
tasty
beer
could
be
a
benchmark
for
the
style
i
would
recommend
you
try
this
beer
dark
rich
and
sweet
the
wheat
base
to
the
bock
gives
it
a
tall
white
rockey
head
and
removed
all
astringency
from
the
mouthfeel
aromas
of
cloves
and
very
very
slight
banana
and
vanilla
aspects
the
malty
bock
backbone
and
lager
fermentation
suppress
most
of
the
yeastybready
fresh
aspects
and
give
it
some
legs
in
the
bottle
d
mighty
fine
brew
one
that
grows
on
you
as
the
beer
drains
down
the
gullet
great
balance
between
banana
and
caramel
inspired
me
to
drink
another
german
beer
after
this
one
brunnen
getan
meine
deutschen
brüder
gut
getanpairs
as
well
with
bacon
wrapped
bockwurst
as
it
does
with
a
medium
rare
filet
mignon
enjoy
d
absolutely
love
this
one
had
it
many
a
time
cant
believe
this
is
the
first
time
im
reviewing
it
would
absolutely
freak
out
if
i
could
find
this
on
tap
somewhere
again
i
simply
cant
stress
how
fine
of
an
effort
this
beer
is
has
to
be
the
best
german
beer
ive
ever
tasted
and
i
cant
imagine
anything
in
the
future
tasting
any
better
than
this
it
took
about
5
minutes
to
get
this
poured
this
beer
was
very
foamy
but
it
was
worth
the
wait
and
the
effort
the
color
is
dark
chestnutty
brown
with
a
near
white
head
that
has
amazing
retention
the
beer
is
fairly
clear
except
for
the
bits
of
yeast
floating
around
the
smell
was
at
first
dominated
by
wheat
beer
yeast
cloves
and
slight
fruit
notes
once
the
head
settles
a
bit
some
wheat
alcohol
and
dark
malt
begins
to
come
through
the
taste
was
much
like
the
smell
with
the
yeast
flavors
dominating
to
begin
with
especially
in
the
head
with
everything
blending
together
a
bit
after
some
time
there
is
a
strong
wheat
beer
aftertaste
with
this
as
well
some
alcoholic
hotness
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
good
highly
carbonated
with
full
body
this
is
a
beer
to
be
reckoned
with
i
doubt
that
there
are
many
weizenbocks
that
resemble
this
one
seek
this
one
out
it
seems
like
the
2001
year
is
ripe
and
ready
now
i
recently
had
a
vintage
99
bottle
that
hadnt
held
up
nearly
as
nice
as
this
one
500ml
bottle
purchased
from
lcbo
in
toronto
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
brown
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
very
nice
wheaty
aroma
taste
is
rich
complex
and
lovely
and
full
of
wheat
and
malt
and
a
bit
of
spice
great
lingering
aftertaste
im
not
one
that
is
able
to
pick
out
a
bunch
of
distinct
tastes
within
the
beer
so
i
wont
even
try
all
i
know
is
that
this
beer
is
wonderful
this
is
an
easydrinking
beer
despite
the
8
per
cent
abv
but
is
best
enjoyed
when
its
sipped
go
slow
and
appreciate
its
greatness
pours
with
a
moderate
head
with
very
good
retention
looks
dark
but
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
is
a
cloudy
amber
color
fairly
intense
carbonation
that
invites
you
to
drink
more
the
smell
is
a
strong
spicy
fruitiness
very
malty
taste
with
bits
of
pepper
cloves
and
banana
showing
through
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
the
high
alcohol
level
might
limit
that
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
plan
on
getting
again
its
taste
and
depth
give
it
a
hefty
mouthfeel
really
want
to
take
it
slow
to
appreciate
this
is
so
utterly
delicious
but
its
a
little
hot
for
an
8percenter
and
maybe
just
a
little
far
over
on
the
desserty
side
to
make
it
an
everyday
indulgence
or
screw
it
indulge
you
only
live
once
chalk
another
one
up
for
the
germans
about
a
three
quarter
inch
head
that
was
very
frothy
i
was
suprised
as
to
how
murky
the
appearance
was
dark
bread
and
hay
aroma
with
some
dough
and
moderate
yeast
dry
tecture
and
a
great
level
of
carbonation
ive
not
had
many
of
this
style
but
i
certainly
will
be
buying
more
of
this
a
wonderful
complex
brew
with
a
moderate
alcohol
hit
beautiful
the
wonderful
mouthfeel
balance
complexities
and
wellmasked
alcohol
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
initially
massive
head
has
a
sweet
malty
smell
that
is
fruity
banana
and
lightly
spicy
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
some
alcoholic
aromas
the
pour
is
crystal
clear
and
a
caramel
color
with
red
hues
the
taste
is
primarily
that
of
toasted
malt
with
some
toffee
notes
the
aventinus
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
low
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
the
finish
remains
malty
but
dries
out
nicely
with
a
lingering
hint
of
hop
bitterness
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
given
the
high
abv
this
is
a
powerful
looking
beer
thick
brown
and
hazy
with
a
big
billowing
lighttan
head
i
love
wheat
beers
but
sometimes
im
in
the
mood
for
something
heavier
this
is
the
best
of
both
worlds
smooth
yeast
aroma
complex
flavors
spice
cloves
banana
not
too
fruity
and
surprisingly
creamy
for
a
wheat
beer
but
still
finishes
crisp
very
full
and
chewy
in
the
mouth
slightly
malty
the
only
problem
is
a
slight
ethanol
bite
i
get
every
few
sips
not
an
everyday
beer
but
amazing
for
special
occasions
a
very
cloudy
browndark
amber
beer
has
a
small
beige
head
that
evaporates
quickly
a
lot
of
clove
character
up
front
in
the
aroma
with
some
nutty
malt
notes
in
the
background
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
at
first
with
some
dried
fruit
notes
in
the
middle
you
get
a
hint
of
clove
on
the
finish
followed
by
the
warming
alcohol
note
on
the
end
pours
a
deep
red
brown
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
that
is
smaller
in
stature
than
id
have
thought
it
might
be
appears
well
carbonated
and
some
residual
yeast
in
the
pour
toward
the
end
the
nose
is
what
id
expect
from
a
weizenbock
wheat
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
or
two
of
mollasses
the
pronounced
yeast
character
almost
smells
belgian
to
me
palate
is
a
nice
agressive
up
front
with
good
yeast
and
malted
grain
notes
strong
carbonation
some
slight
spiciness
but
mostly
the
sweet
malts
and
a
little
banana
bread
suggestion
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
but
well
balanced
with
the
sweetness
finishing
pleasingly
dry
medium
mouthfeel
over
all
i
like
this
i
cant
say
it
quite
lives
up
to
the
expectations
i
had
for
it
based
on
reputation
but
this
is
a
solid
weizenbock
all
the
way
if
youre
one
for
the
style
its
a
must
try
dont
know
what
went
wrong
last
time
but
this
was
very
agreeable
i
would
not
go
so
far
to
call
it
a
favorite
but
ill
certainly
keep
a
couple
on
hand
note
i
had
originally
thought
that
this
was
a
regular
doppelbock
but
as
i
have
not
had
a
doppelbock
either
my
warning
still
applies
smells
just
like
a
dunkelweizen
with
some
alcohol
and
banana
esters
perhaps
a
whiff
of
hop
aroma
vibrant
active
head
and
a
murky
rich
brown
color
beneath
strong
bublegum
with
a
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
hop
dryness
in
the
finish
there
is
a
slight
tartness
missing
from
doppelbocks
maybe
from
the
wheat
smooth
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
extremely
drinkable
overall
tough
for
me
to
judge
to
be
honest
im
not
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
one
is
obviously
well
beyond
most
other
brews
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
you
dont
need
me
to
tell
you
to
try
it
i
love
the
intensity
of
character
here
without
a
terrible
amount
of
sweetness
it
really
makes
this
beer
satisfying
and
drinkable
the
only
minor
disappointment
is
that
it
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
complexity
although
that
shouldnt
be
surprising
given
the
simplicity
of
the
ingredients
it
pours
a
dark
purplish
brown
with
a
simply
enormous
head
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
large
glass
stein
and
had
to
pause
for
quite
some
time
for
this
monster
head
to
go
down
as
it
did
so
small
clumps
of
this
frothy
head
were
left
behind
oddly
the
head
consisted
of
large
bubbles
toward
its
base
and
the
top
of
the
head
was
almost
like
whipped
egg
whites
real
nice
smelling
beer
sweet
malts
caramel
and
a
grape
like
fruitiness
that
i
was
not
expecting
it
is
the
same
in
taste
terrific
very
smooth
the
well
measured
carbonation
lends
a
creamy
mouthfeel
a
nice
spice
twang
that
seems
to
eminate
from
the
alcoholic
warm
in
the
back
i
might
sense
a
slight
hop
hint
as
well
nice
and
balanced
very
enjoyable
definately
a
high
quality
beer
no
doubt
no
question
about
it
if
i
gave
it
a
rating
though
id
probably
give
it
an
88
it
was
good
but
as
the
first
90
rated
beer
ive
had
i
have
yet
to
be
blown
away
overall
an
excellent
beer
the
natural
progression
up
from
the
hefe
remarkably
drinkable
d
dont
get
me
wrong
its
really
good
but
i
dont
think
it
is
5
a
pint
at
a
liquor
store
good
id
much
rather
go
and
spend
12
on
a
four
pack
of
celebrator
if
im
in
a
mood
for
something
along
these
lines
definitely
worth
a
try
because
i
could
see
someone
who
thinks
this
beer
is
great
this
is
my
favorite
weizenbock
hands
down
with
only
victory
moonglow
even
coming
remotely
close
to
this
in
flavor
and
body
this
is
on
my
top
10
maybe
5
all
time
best
brews
ever
timeless
d
could
drink
this
one
all
the
time
very
pleasant
that
is
enjoyable
thru
and
thru
easy
drinking
for
a
complex
beer
almost
anyone
could
drink
this
one
even
the
beer
haters
i
liked
the
drinkability
the
after
taste
is
very
nice
and
leaves
a
nice
fruity
taste
which
kinda
hides
the
8
alcohol
congtent
although
i
can
see
that
drinking
a
lot
of
this
beer
could
be
dangerous
if
you
want
to
drive
a
car
or
operate
heavy
machinery
pours
a
nice
deep
brown
good
sized
tan
head
with
nice
lacing
has
an
alcoholic
nose
with
clove
fruit
and
banana
taste
starts
off
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
fruity
tang
plus
some
slight
caramel
flavors
finishes
more
with
clove
and
an
alcoholic
taste
heavy
and
creamy
though
there
is
a
crispness
to
the
beer
as
well
a
very
interesting
and
delicious
beer
a
fine
addition
to
any
german
beer
fans
repetoir
this
is
massive
beer
by
every
measure
especially
taste
smell
mouthfeel
alcohol
content
the
color
is
deep
brown
almost
beginning
to
redden
with
sparkling
carbonation
the
offwhite
head
was
small
and
dissipated
quickly
and
no
lace
ever
formed
the
smell
is
smoky
and
clovespicy
with
dark
fruity
aromas
the
higher
than
average
alcohol
is
detectable
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
complex
and
multilayered
with
deep
wheaty
malts
and
bready
notes
followed
by
sharp
spicy
phenols
with
significant
tart
character
the
mouthfeel
is
warming
from
the
alcohol
to
be
sure
and
very
carbonated
and
crisp
almost
sharp
the
finish
is
long
and
not
solventy
but
a
bit
hot
this
is
very
drinkable
in
spite
of
its
high
alcohol
content
a
superb
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
1
inch
layer
of
creamy
off
white
head
on
top
this
beer
has
the
best
head
retention
ive
ever
seen
aroma
is
yeasty
smells
like
a
wheat
beer
masking
most
of
the
malts
carmel
like
malts
and
maybe
chocolate
are
evident
in
the
flavor
along
with
the
yeasty
flavor
there
is
a
faint
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
but
overall
it
hides
the
high
alcohol
volume
well
full
bodied
drinkability
is
great
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
but
it
might
not
be
a
good
idea
drinkability
good
but
not
exceptional
drinkability
the
only
thing
about
this
beer
that
i
had
any
issue
with
not
that
its
necessarily
hard
to
drink
but
that
it
is
something
that
should
not
be
consumed
in
any
sort
of
excess
due
to
its
overall
sweetness
amount
of
yeast
and
alcohol
content
not
a
beer
to
trifle
with
which
is
sad
because
its
so
delicious
drinkability
this
beer
stays
interesting
through
the
whole
session
which
is
helped
by
its
full
flavored
nature
the
one
draw
back
is
how
rich
it
is

the

this
is

0
beer
if
there
ever
was
one
overall
imo
this
brew
is
really
good
love
the
subtle
flavor
of
clove
fruit
and
root
beer
having
drank
several
weizenbock
this
is
the
best
on
so
far
for
most
of
the
flavor
being
on
the
sweetside
the
finish
leans
toward
a
dry
clovelike
finish
this
company
is
the
king
of
wheat
beers
drinkability
is
good
but
the
alcohol
content
is
a
bit
high
for
a
session
beer
the
beer
had
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
hints
of
orange
and
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
smell
had
prunes
some
banana
and
a
bit
of
alcoholclove
spiciness
the
taste
is
right
on
to
the
style
it
has
dark
fruit
mixed
with
bready
malts
with
some
banana
and
vanilla
in
there
too
it
also
has
a
faint
taste
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
i
am
always
amazed
when
a
beer
is
real
creamy
with
this
high
carbonation
overall
i
didnt
particularly
like
this
one
i
dont
know
what
is
was
but
i
just
didnt
like
it
sorry
the
mouth
is
complex
as
the
yeast
and
sugar
interact
with
one
another
a
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
its
pretty
drinkable
although
its
not
all
its
hyped
up
to
be
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
deceptive
abv
notwithstanding
the
beer
combines
the
enjoyable
flavors
of
a
hefe
weizen
with
the
strength
of
a
bock
nicely
done
really
quite
a
beautiful
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
definitely
must
be
respected
if
you
like
doppelbocks
or
hearty
brews
with
big
chartacter
give
aventinus
a
try
its
a
great
beer
drinkability
this
is
good
but
high
abv
holds
down
sessionability
this
is
an
excellent
weizenbock
and
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
its
a
sheer
pleasure
to
drink
but
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
bravo
notes
a
golden
standard
for
the
weizenbock
and
for
quality
brewing
in
general
probably
as
close
to
a
perfect
beer
as
can
be
found
on
earth
this
hazy
brown
beer
poured
with
one
of
the
liveliest
heads
ive
ever
seen
though
it
then
settled
down
and
left
only
the
slightest
trace
of
lacing
a
spicy
cinnamon
aroma
along
with
a
peculiar
sweetness
i
associate
with
canned
corn
dominate
the
nose
and
taste
the
relatively
high
alcohol
content
also
contributes
to
the
flavor
i
definitely
welcomed
those
esters
for
adding
an
additional
dimension
to
the
otherwise
clobbering
maltyness
to
that
end
i
found
that
a
few
bites
of
dark
chocolate
brought
out
a
crispness
that
i
might
have
otherwise
overlooked
overall
a
bit
of
a
heavier
brew
than
i
usually
care
for
but
definitely
worth
experiencing
drinkability
great
beer
but
the
higher
levels
of
carbonation
sweetness
and
alcohol
combine
to
make
this
a
beer
i
usually
only
want
one
or
two
of
the
pour
into
my
aventinus
glass
i
love
it
when
i
get
the
chance
for
this
raises
a
head
that
just
wont
stay
in
forcing
me
to
wait
for
it
to
subside
it
falls
slowly
to
a
thick
tan
layer
that
wont
depart

body

is
strong
and
clovey
with
lots
of
banana

along
with
a
lot
of
sweet

as
well
the
mouth
is
full
with
lower
carbonation
than
most
wheats
very
nice
very
drinkable
this
is
basically
the
wheat
version
of
a
doppelbock
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
was
a
real
treat
consider
this
a
great
dessert
beer
try
this
one
you
wont
regret
it
big
bold
cream
chewy
body
that
just
keeps
gettin
better
till
the
end
this
is
one
ale
of
superb
quality
you
must
try
this
one
for
the
sake
of
great
beer
and
a
strong
german
at
that
cheers
i
found
this
hard
work
to
drink
nice
flavours
but
i
would
like
less
of
the
effects
like
the
heat
alcohol
elements
wow
a
brew
of
extraordinary
magnitude
i
was
a
bit
surprised
based
on
my
findings
to
see
aventinus
with
a
91
score
i
feel
its
a
good
beer
but
for
some
reason
its
just
not
that
good
to
me
this
could
be
a
case
of
sensory
overload
however
as
i
can
tell
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
this
bocks
aroma
and
tastes
but
its
hard
to
decifer
exactly
what
it
is
upon
pouring
there
was
a
nice
firm
tan
head
and
a
murky
turbid
brown
body
that
reminded
me
of
swamp
water
unreal
then
poof
the
heads
gone
not
a
trace
not
even
a
whisper
of
head
or
lace
for
much
of
the
drink
aromas
were
thick
with
a
yeasty
fruity
clovelike
smell
that
was
very
hard
to
decern
the
taste
also
was
very
complex
wtih
fruit
and
floral
flavors
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
upfront
and
fading
alcohol
on
the
back
end
overall
a
very
fine
drink
i
would
have
again
but
somehow
i
just
dont
understand
the
super
high
rating
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
a
dunkelweizen
and
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
very
fruity
like
a
belgian
and
pours
a
belgianstyle
head
not
much
lacing
down
the
glass
but
who
cares
the
taste
is
phenomenal
cherries
plums
and
bananas
seep
through
heavy
alcohol
warms
in
this
well
balanced
brew
this
beer
attacks
your
taste
buds
an
outstanding
beer
without
a
doubt
the
drink
ability
it
great
this
is
a
top
world
class
beer
nothing
bad
and
almost
everything
over
and
above
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
mouthfeel
is
very
substantial
i
will
have
to
try
some
others
from
the
same
style
to
really
compare
this
ale
aventinus
poured
a
dark
cow
brown
color
with
a
beatiful
twofingered
head
which
settled
down
rather
quickly
to
a
thin
head
that
lingered
around
for
the
remainder
of
the
glass
beautiful
looking
beer
which
has
good
lacing
while
drinking
but
nothing
that
sticks
to
the
glass
smells
of
bready
yeasty
bananas
clove
coriander
the
taste
is
just
wow
coming
through
the
palate
is
yeast
breadiness
coriander
honeydew
some
cherries
a
little
anise
bananas
and
an
unbelievable
clove
finish
with
some
alcohol
warmth
extremely
complex
brew
here
and
ridiculously
yummy
one
of
the
better
tasting
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
velvety
and
moderatehigh
carbonation
i
could
drink
these
everyday
to
start
off
a
session
absolutely
amazing
beer
a
true
masterpiece
of
the
style
hats
off
overall
great
quality
this
would
be
a
very
nice
strong
beer
to
pair
with
a
nice
german
meal
of
wursts
and
sauerkraut
if
you
like
the
style
of
beer
this
is
a
definte
must
try
overall
the
best
or
very
close
to
the
best
weizen
i
have
ever
had
it
has
lots
of
complexity
which
most
weizens
ive
had
lacked
severely
the
carbonation
is
very
smooth
and
refreshing
and
the
alcohol
is
deviously
hidden
a
must
have
repeatedly
weizenbock
aventinus
pours
a
caramel
brown
darker
and
murkier
toward
the
top
of
the
glass
into
an
aventinus
glass
from
a
brown
5
liter
bottle
it
smells
like
clove
banana
and
more
clove
definitely
an
intese
smelling
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
loads
of
banana
and
clove
flavor
some
alcohol
warming
this
really
is
an
excellent
beer
it
has
the
flavors
of
a
weiss
beer
on
steroids
almost
the
equivalent
perhaps
of
what
americans
have
done
to
the
ipa
pimp
it
out
to
the
max
highly
recommended
pours
a
murky
brown
with
carbonation
running
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
forming
a
thin
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
liquids
surface
smells
strongly
of
bananas
and
light
rum
booziness
with
slight
chocolate
from
the
dark
malts
the
best
way
to
describe
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
chocolate
drizzled
and
lightly
clove
spiced
banana
bread
tastes
like
a
pumped
up
dunkelweizen
all
around
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
additional
flavors
of
raisins
dates
and
other
dried
fruits
there
is
also
a
very
bright
tart
and
sweet
combination
in
the
finish
that
prevents
this
from
becoming
to
tiring
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
of
sturdy
body
with
pleasant
viscosity
combined
with
lively
bubbles
with
excelent
body
and
flavor
makes
this
a
great
drinker
cheers
a
light
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
but
the
aftertaste
and
harshness
makes
for
a
pretty
good
but
not
great
drinkability
drinkability
definitely
the
standard
and
the
standardkiller
for
weizenbocks
simply
superb
combination
of
wheat
and
bock
tendencies
resulting
in
a
ridiculously
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
this
bottle
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
my
first
encounter
with
this
in
the
schneiderbrau
restaurant
in
munich
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
isnt
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
you
feel
its
warmth
once
its
gone
dry
and
easy
to
drink
this
may
be
a
bit
too
drinkable
at
8
alcohol
it
could
get
you
into
trouble
if
you
arent
careful
i
will
definitely
have
this
one
again
very
well
done
overall
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
long
this
one
will
do
your
stomach
right
i
think
at
3
59
for
500ml
17oz
it
will
do
your
wallet
right
as
well
this
is
a
winner
simply
an
astounding
presentation
of
the
style
this
makes
two
excellent
beers
by
schneider
sohn
and
i
expect
the
weisseneisbocks
i
have
downstairs
will
be
a
third
get
this
stuff
i
could
drink
2
or
3
of
these
at
a
sitting
drinkabilty
for
8
its
off
the
charts
but
i
like
savoring
a
bottle
personally
great
beer
one
of
my
favorites
for
sure
it
will
eternally
astound
me
that
these
german
beers
have
just
4
ingredients
in
them
stellar
overall
quite
drinkable
but
the
abv
tends
to
limit
my
intake
very
unique
and
well
worth
trying
im
looking
forward
to
my
next
one
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
continue
to
come
back
to
time
and
again
a
unique
brew
which
stands
in
a
class
by
itself
and
is
sets
the
standard
for
a
weizenbock
a
must
try
and
highly
recommended
poured
a
dark
mahganybrown
the
head
formed
quickly
to
a
creamy
white
inch
aromas
from
this
unique
brew
are
yeasty
ripe
darker
fruit
not
quite
ripe
banana
and
some
nice
mellow
caramel
the
taste
is
very
complex
and
good
it
starts
off
with
the
dark
fruit
flavors
like
raisin
and
plum
rich
malt
throughout
some
tart
wheat
well
hidden
alchohol
and
a
slightly
spicy
finish
with
a
bit
of
clove
and
hint
of
cinnamon
mouthfeel
is
fairly
effervecent
this
weizenbock
is
an
exellent
and
different
beer
tastes
good
i
cant
really
imagine
tiring
of
this
one
too
quickly
although
that
abv
is
liable
to
creep
up
on
you
what
an
interesting
beer
its
a
deep
brownamber
color
with
maybe
the
slightest
hint
of
red
head
is
small
and
dissapears
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
as
well
as
wheatiness
and
sour
cherries
the
taste
is
a
great
balance
of
yeasty
wheat
and
malts
with
a
mild
alcohol
finish
the
alcohol
becomes
more
pronounced
upon
warming
mouthfeel
is
excellent
it
goes
down
great
and
has
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
this
would
be
great
for
the
summer
since
its
easy
on
the
flavors
but
has
a
nice
warming
aspect
to
it
that
makes
it
great
for
coldweather
enjoyment
as
well
certainly
worth
a
shot
just
dont
drive
home
after
having
one
of
these
wondeful
example
of
the
style
and
definitely
a
world
class
brew
a
world
classic
for
sure
industry
benchmark
i
like
this
beer
it
has
a
wonderful
flavor
that
is
unmatched
by
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
its
easy
to
drink
frankly
it
could
be
unnoticed
unless
you
take
time
to
realize
that
it
is
unique
and
special
it
is
that
subtle
try
this
one
without
prejudice
and
enjoy
drinkability
whoops
is
it
gone
well
back
to
the
fridge
d
excellent
again
very
nice
beer
that
has
earned
its
high
praise
someone
needs
to
tame
this
head
it
was
on
a
rampage
3
fingers
worth
topped
sexy
coffeencola
body
nose
is
sweet
like
cotton
candy
somewhat
fruity
bringing
to
mind
citrusy
fruits
upon
sipping
i
can
taste
apricots
cotton
candy
spices
yum
mouth
is
silky
smooth
certainly
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
a
must
buy
if
you
crave
this
style
a
good
beer
overall
but
it
fell
short
of
my
expectations
this
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
hint
of
the
wheat
color
shining
through
at
the
edges
pours
a
solid
head
the
smell
reminds
me
of
a
golden
field
of
wheat
that
got
busy
with
some
nice
heady
malt
it
has
a
very
complex
taste
the
dark
malt
dances
on
a
beautiful
moonlit
night
with
spice
of
the
wheat
and
the
yeast
it
is
a
marriage
made
by
the
beer
angels
pours
chocolatelybrown
and
cloudylooks
just
like
a
dark
unflitered
wheat
beer
respectable
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thick
bubbly
layer
over
my
beer
it
smells
rich
and
creamy
and
the
smell
displays
more
of
the
german
wheat
beer
characteristics
than
the
taste
actually
does
smells
distinctly
of
bananas
and
cloves
the
taste
is
mild
and
somewhat
constricted
but
really
very
good
and
it
tastes
like
a
classic
which
i
suppose
it
is
definitely
a
good
beer
to
watch
out
for
and
to
try
at
least
once
on
a
warm
summer
night
on
the
patio
of
your
favorite
beer
bar
d
quite
enjoyable
a
terrific
beer
for
all
seasons
and
one
that
will
go
near
the
top
of
my
personal
favorites
understandable
why
this
is
such
a
highly
rated
beer
incredibly
high
carbonation
defines
the
mouthfeel
a
perfect
strong
summer
beer
d
superb
beer
easy
to
see
why
its
so
highly
regarded
even
at
8
it
is
supremely
drinkable
d
doesnt
feeltaste
anywhere
near
8
more
like
56
easy
to
drink
but
not
particularly
refreshing
one
will
do
me
fine
before
i
move
onto
something
else
but
more
of
a
style
issue
than
the
fault
of
this
beer
pours
a
very
murkycloudy
bronze
color
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
with
little
to
no
lacing
the
smell
is
what
hit
me
right
from
the
bat
a
bouquet
of
fruit
raisins
cloves
wheat
a
hint
of
bubblegum
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
very
impressive
the
bubblegum
flavor
is
present
not
quite
a
hefe
weissen
taste
its
labeled
as
a
wheat
dopplebock
and
thats
really
what
it
tastes
like
a
wheat
beer
crossed
with
a
dopplebock
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
beer
not
something
ill
probably
pick
up
all
that
often
but
definitely
something
ill
pick
up
as
a
switchup
now
and
again
dark
brown
slight
haze
good
two
finger
head
that
hangs
around
smells
of
wheaty
booze
with
some
toasty
parts
to
it
the
hops
arent
realy
prevelant
to
me
slight
clove
flavors
go
with
the
wheat
sweetness
that
is
held
back
with
the
alcohol
and
natrual
roasted
bitterness
good
body
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
at
room
temp
but
it
seems
to
have
a
better
body
in
the
2nd
bottle
that
was
closer
to
60f
very
drinkable
and
would
pair
well
with
just
about
any
dish
i
can
think
of
bottle
purchased
at
greens
in
atlanta
this
pours
a
mixture
of
dark
brown
and
amber
with
a
tan
foamy
head
glass
gives
off
a
gentle
furity
aroma
i
enjoyed
the
spicy
taste
throughout
the
glass
and
it
left
a
long
good
finish
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
again
all
i
can
say
is
round
balanced
this
beer
seemed
to
be
created
whole
complex
but
with
everything
seamlessly
interlocked
you
can
taste
the
wheat
and
it
belongs
there
bitterness
not
harsh
almost
unnoticible
slightly
tannic
finish
too
tasty
too
drinkable
i
can
get
in
trouble
with
this
one
so
pours
a
hazy
chestnut
brown
with
a
2
finger
head
ok
longevity
and
good
lace
soft
caramel
and
dried
fruit
aroma
smells
tart
big
caramel
and
brown
sugar
notes
mixed
with
dried
dark
fruits
sticky
and
warming
complex
and
flavorful
not
super
drinkable
on
its
own
but
would
be
great
with
food
overall
just
awesome
as
a
huge
hefe
fan
i
am
in
heaven
taste
is
quite
sweet
first
the
hops
come
in
with
their
fruity
kick
such
as
banana
and
apples
followed
by
an
earthy
malty
presence
which
ends
with
a
cereal
but
shy
flavors
not
the
worst
review
but
i
think
with
a
good
specimen
bottle
of
this
beer
it
would
get
a
better
rating
aventinus
is
renowned
for
good
reason
despite
the
touch
of
bitterness
it
is
still
fairly
smooth
and
drinkable
its
complexities
and
spices
make
this
a
great
sipping
treat
pours
a
very
cloudy
mahogany
with
the
yeast
pour
soapy
offwhite
head
fills
the
glass
then
settles
to
three
fingers
good
retention
and
a
few
sticky
spots
of
lace
belgian
phenols
like
plastic
and
banana
in
the
nose
and
a
plum
ester
as
it
warms
sweet
toasted
wheat
malt
flavor
with
loads
of
phenols
and
raisinlike
ester
weak
noble
hops
in
the
aftertaste
semidry
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
medium
carbonation
and
medium
full
body
lots
of
texture
from
wheat
and
yeast
but
also
crisp
tart
and
dry
finish
with
no
ester
phenols
mellow
out
but
get
in
the
way
of
the
wheat
flavor
and
seem
out
of
place
where
you
would
normally
find
a
residual
sweet
finish
interesting
but
not
what
i
reach
for
when
i
want
a
wheat
doppelbock
the
only
knock
id
have
on
this
beer
if
you
could
even
call
it
that
is
that
im
not
sure
if
id
want
to
drink
more
than
one
bottle
in
a
sitting
one
alone
works
just
fine
though
what
a
classic
but
unusual
beer
though
i
guess
the
weizenbocks
are
certainly
becoming
more
common
but
like
many
such
beers
you
either
love
or
you
hate
it
i
for
one
love
it
complex
and
deceptively
drinkable
highly
recommended
i
drank
this
slightly
hungry
just
to
make
sure
i
could
get
it
all
down
but
i
ended
up
still
getting
quite
full
from
this
beer
im
sure
experience
bas
could
handle
it
with
no
problem
but
i
got
quite
full
and
surely
felt
that
8
2
its
very
deceptive
make
sure
you
take
you
time
with
this
one
i
imagine
this
would
go
well
with
grilled
pork
chops
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
this
one
in
the
near
future
drinkability
well
its
a
fine
beer
but
not
one
i
want
to
have
every
night
the
overly
extroverted
alcohol
betrays
the
other
flavors
and
makes
this
beer
not
as
drinkable
as
it
could
be
still
a
good
experience
but
not
sure
how
many
more
ill
have
of
this
beer
aventinus
can
stand
alone
with
hardcore
craft
drinkers
or
would
make
a
good
crossover
brew
for
beginners
this
is
a
definite
worldclass
beer
my
best
advice
is
just
to
make
sure
youre
drinking
the
weizenbock
and
not
the
weizeneisbock
the
bottles
look
the
same
so
ask
to
look
at
the
bottle
before
your
server
pours
it
poured
a
cloudy
rustbrown
color
with
a
bubblelaiden
soft
cream
colored
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
just
a
touch
of
lacing
high
level
of
carbonation
with
very
tiny
bubbles
gracing
the
surface
seemed
like
i
was
dreaming
an
incredible
number
of
aromas
seemed
to
come
out
including
honey
grains
earth
sweet
fruit
and
alcohol
the
taste
was
dominated
by
that
of
dark
fruit
and
wheat
subtle
earth
mud
and
smoked
flavors
added
character
and
depth
the
texture
was
slightly
chewy
with
a
mediumfinish
that
seemed
to
involve
figs
and
dates
the
beer
starts
off
smooth
and
semisweet
but
finishes
bitter
start
to
finish
this
is
one
of
the
most
incredible
and
flavorful
brews
ive
ever
had
damn
thats
good
beer
outstanding
a
more
awesome
dunkel
bock
version
of
the
original
schneider
weisse
hefe
which
was
very
yummy
itself
this
beer
poured
a
very
deep
amber
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
holds
well
and
laces
nicely
the
smell
is
primarily
of
belgian
yeast
but
also
has
hints
of
sweet
wine
like
aromas
the
taste
is
very
belgian
like
which
is
probably
due
to
the
yeast
the
beer
is
also
very
sweet
with
dark
fruit
taste
but
maintains
its
its
bock
like
characteristics
the
beer
is
nicely
thick
with
some
decent
dryness
overall
i
am
a
little
tired
of
the
belgian
yeast
flavor
at
the
moment
but
this
one
did
not
dissapoint
too
much
and
is
pretty
good
very
smooth
and
easy
driking
for
an
8
beer
a
benchmark
beer
for
the
style
not
necessarily
the
best
theres
a
czech
brewery
that
makes
a
better
one
imo
but
if
you
want
to
know
what
a
weizen
doppelbock
is
all
about
this
is
where
to
start
though
the
mouthfeel
was
fizzy
and
bitter
at
first
later
fading
into
a
smooth
sweetness
it
was
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
quite
drinkable
but
the
higher
abv
might
not
allow
you
to
enjoy
the
complexity
after
a
few
glasses
try
it
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
cant
get
enough
of
delightful
500
ml
bottle
received
from
luckysevens82
and
bif33
team
spring
pours
into
the
tall
weizen
glass
with
a
monstrous
antique
head
full
of
tightly
packed
bubbles
opaque
at
the
top
of
the
glass
and
translucent
below
smell
is
spicy
banana
the
traditional
wheat
nose
taste
is
a
luscious
banana
bread
with
a
soda
like
spritz
following
spiciness
on
the
edges
that
mixes
with
a
reasonable
sweetness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
at
the
start
and
thins
out
considerably
in
the
finish
probably
due
to
that
fine
bubble
carbonation
oh
so
easy
to
quaff
we
grilled
some
ny
strips
medium
rare
and
this
is
what
we
chose
to
have
with
it
superb
uncapped
this
bottle
on
a
beautiful
spring
evening
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
bit
slight
but
then
the
head
settled
nicely
with
a
rich
silky
looking
foam
this
foam
added
to
the
texture
which
then
added
to
the
thickness
of
the
sweet
wheat
flavour
the
flavour
is
also
caramel
and
plum
like
slight
acidic
and
dry
finish
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
flavour
very
satisfying
this
beer
is
to
be
sipped
and
admired
dark
brown
body
with
an
initially
big
fizzy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
banana
wheat
and
cloves
the
flavor
is
wheat
caramel
toffee
cinnamon
and
apples
the
finish
is
long
slightly
bitter
and
a
bit
tart
as
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
lively
carbonation
that
bites
the
tongue
impressive
mmmm
boy
that
was
at
tasty
one
very
pleased
with
aventinus
on
my
vacation
in
georgia
nice
copper
color
which
displayed
a
bit
of
yeast
sediment
can
understand
this
as
a
wheat
beer
with
great
notes
of
chocolate
and
fruit
very
easy
to
finish
after
not
drinking
for
quite
a
while
i
could
feel
this
one
very
warm
in
the
stomach
a
wonderful
beer
overall
not
quite
what
i
expected
i
expected
a
little
more
doppelbock
but
instead
was
presented
with
a
predominant
wheat
beer
a
nice
beer
with
a
medium
to
heavy
body
and
great
carbonation
a
real
delight
overall
a
very
nice
dark
wheat
probably
my
favorite
of
the
style
a
must
try
beer
smells
foral
sweet
and
medicinal
with
hints
of
figs
and
raisins
heavy
dose
of
cloves
and
wheat
lots
of
alcohol
definatly
a
sipping
beer
taste
bites
the
tongue
and
warms
the
inside
a
great
winter
warmer
definatly
a
good
beer
but
its
drinkability
isnt
there
for
me
just
a
little
to
strong
overall
im
disappointed
in
this
beer
especially
with
its
high
ranking
on
the
best
of
list
it
was
rather
expensive
compared
to
other
doppelbocks
but
i
dont
think
it
was
worth
the
extra
i
probably
wont
buy
this
one
again
d
i
could
drink
this
one
all
afternoon
but
at
8
abv
my
common
sense
steers
me
clear
this
beer
is
one
of
the
most
defining
brands
for
the
style
superb
overall
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
it
combined
some
of
the
characters
that
i
like
in
hefe
weizens
with
nice
rich
malt
flavors
d
quite
good
especially
considering
the
strength
always
a
treat
so
good
you
should
try
not
to
spoil
yourself
and
have
it
too
often
one
bottle
is
more
than
enough
buy
a
few
and
save
them
for
special
occasions
the
color
of
the
beer
was
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
tint
of
red
there
was
large
amounts
of
tan
head
that
did
not
last
the
beer
smelled
of
strong
yeast
and
malt
with
first
taste
of
this
beer
i
was
suprised
by
the
amount
of
carbonation
once
i
got
over
the
carbination
i
was
able
to
taste
strong
malt
followed
by
hints
of
banana
and
cloves
there
was
a
large
amount
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
was
a
very
smooth
beer
and
once
i
became
used
to
the
carbonation
it
was
a
delight
on
the
palate
turbid
prune
juice
color
with
a
lasting
thick
offwhite
head
dark
sweet
slightly
musty
aroma
sweet
juicy
fruity
malty
flavor
slight
alcohol
apparent
clear
sugary
sweetness
from
the
wheat
delicious
medium
body
with
even
smallbubbled
carbonation
very
impressively
drinkable
for
an
8
beer
with
this
much
flavor
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
doppelbock
but
not
quite
so
rich
but
still
packed
with
flavor
beautiful
in
my
weizen
glass
the
lower
portion
of
the
beer
is
translucent
and
an
almost
bright
orange
mahogany
the
beer
in
the
wider
are
of
the
glass
looks
considerably
darker
almost
red
and
deeply
brown
the
contrast
is
remarkably
striking
the
head
is
huge
tan
and
frothy
aromas
are
heavy
of
banana
and
cloves
there
is
also
some
berry
presence
as
well
as
chocolate
and
apple
peals
tastes
is
jammy
and
has
a
sticky
caramelness
about
it
banana
cloves
chocolate
anise
and
dark
fruits
all
enter
into
play
this
is
just
wonderful
truly
wonderful
drinkability
is
supreme
mouthfeel
is
smooth
very
sessionable
even
at
8
degrees
very
much
deserves
its
reputation
aventinus
will
always
have
a
reserved
slot
in
my
fridge
a
world
class
ale
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
bottle
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
huge
creamy
white
light
brown
head
which
is
mostly
lasting
with
good
lacing
has
a
complex
aroma
at
first
i
get
sweet
perfume
then
you
get
chocolate
malts
with
plenty
of
good
spices
and
some
bubble
gum
has
a
smooth
palate
with
easy
drinking
flavor
light
on
carbination
and
lacks
some
finish
but
has
a
nice
duration
has
a
medium
body
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
the
flavors
really
come
out
even
taste
some
cherry
very
easy
drinking
sips
extremely
well
big
ups
to
xeryuspool
for
sharing
this
with
me
the
carbonation
creates
honey
combs
at
the
top
of
the
brew
small
bubbles
around
the
outside
the
beer
mellows
out
to
become
more
drinkable
as
it
warms
but
i
still
found
it
to
be
less
drinkable
than
most
beers
a
llitle
too
strong
on
the
acidic
alcohol
taste
for
me
but
still
very
interesting
in
short
this
is
a
beer
absolutely
enjoyable
now
this
is
a
beer
luscious
head
with
attractive
lace
scents
are
complex
some
banana
cherry
and
sandalwood
taste
is
excellent
although
it
reminds
me
of
coup
des
grisou
geyser
which
i
fondly
remember
from
montreal
which
means
there
is
a
finer
beer
of
this
sort
out
there
perhaps
i
am
just
nostalgic
but
this
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
a
fresh
coup
still
one
of
the
more
pleasant
surprises
from
the
lcbo
damn
them
and
their
monopoly
poured
into
a
20oz
tumbler
closest

got
to
proper
glassware
unfortunately
slightly
hazy
bronze
with
a
massive
silky
ecru
head
light
carbonation
rising
persistently
heavy
wheat
aroma
at
first
underlying
clove
scents
with
faint
presence
of
fruity
esters
overripe
banana
spiced
cider
sweet
banana
and
clove
character
immediately
come
to
the
fore
in
the
first
sip
malty

on
the
followthrough
something
of
a
sourish
vegetable
aftertaste
mouthcoating
elixir
this
one
is
fullbodied
and
slick
banana
burps
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
beer
is
so
wellmade
i
cant
help
but
find
it
extremely
drinkable
deserving
of
all
accolades
it
receives
mouthfeeldrinkability
slick
slippery
viscous
and
mouth
filling
a
terrific
environment
for
the
feel
and
tastes
of
this
beer
no
problem
drinking
this
one
its
truly
outstanding
and
very
easy
to
find
phenomenal
when
fresh
equaly
good
but
completely
different
when
aged
superb
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
head
but
is
more
fizzy
than
creamy
as
you
would
expect
head
slowly
receded
and
left
only
a
ring
around
the
glass
and
no
lacing
much
more
of
a
caramel
and
chocolate
aroma
with
subdued
spices
and
hints
of
banana
i
find
more
molasses
chocolate
caramel
bread
with
only
a
little
bit
of
banana
taste
is
definately
much
more
mellowed
after
nearly
6
years
but
it
is
pretty
nicely
blended
seems
a
little
light
and
watery
by
now
with
almost
no
carbonation
still
a
good
beer
but
it
just
seems
to
be
lacking
compared
to
a
fresher
bottle
d
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
its
definitely
a
must
have
and
it
even
comes
at
a
good
price
go
get
some
you
just
want
to
deliberately
sip
this
brew
over
and
over
again
to
extract
out
all
the
greatness
precisely
what
a
german
bier
should
be
makes
me
want
to
move

poured
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
large
head
that
never
quite
went
away
i
poured
the
entire
contents
of
the
bottle
into
my
glass
including
the
yeast
at
the
bottom
so
it
was
nice
and
cloudy
the
aroma
was
heavenly
with
whiffs
of
bubblegum
spices
and
malt
in
the
nose
taste
was
equally
impressive
with
notes
of
clove
spices
chocolate
and
malt
in
the
palate
this
beer
was
medium
to
full
bodied
and
had
a
nice
spicysweet
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
alcoholic
warmth
this
is
really
an
incredible
weizenbock
and
one
that
i
will
come
back
to
again
and
again
recommended
big
beer
with
big
taste
aroma
and
big
alcohol
kick
d
for
its
style
i
think
it
is
very
drinkable
nice
would
be
nice
on
cool
summer
nights
very
nice
this
deserves
to
be
rated
so
highly
ive
never
had
such
complex
full
tastes
from
a
bock
before
which
is
saying
something
very
drinkable
but
tastes
are
too
intnese
to
make
this
a
session
choice
not
a
huge
weizen
guy
i
think
the
bock
side
of
this
appeals
to
me
more
this
is
probably
amongst
top
3
of
the
weizenbocks
ive
tried
id
love
to
have
this
with
a
rueben
sandwich
some
pickles
or
hell
even
blutwurst
enjoy
i
do
like
everything
this
brewery
puts
out
that
ive
tried
despite
the
fact
they
are
all
wheat
beers
slightly
hazy
amber
beer
with
a
thick
beige
head
heavy
aroma
with
sweetness
toffee
cloves
dried
fruits
a
little
banana
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
it
is
quite
fizzy
in
the
mouth
but
not
as
sticky
as
expected
and
flavors
of
caramell
cloves
hops
alcohol
banana
and
dried
fruits
swirls
around
your
mouth
along
with
some
yeasty
notes
finishing
off
in
a
sweet
yet
bitter
warming
aftertaste
that
leaves
you
very
satisfied
fullbodied
classic
beer
and
it
was
a
good
choice
for
this
cold
snowy
evening
it
left
me
very
pleased
060216
it
was
a
very
clear
dark
amber
with
fantastic
white
head
it
was
fairly
well
carbonated
and
looked
great
in
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
wheaty
almost
like
a
hef
it
was
very
cidery
in
scent
with
tons
of
floral
notes
the
only
deduction
i
had
was
that
an
alcohol
quality
was
sensed
during
wafting
it
tastes
of
malty
richness
as
wheat
fills
the
mouth
it
is
exceptional
for
the
style
but
a
tinge
too
sweet
for
my
taste
buds
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
rich
but
not
too
thick
fantastic
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
and
i
will
break
another
one
out
during
the
summer
poolside
deep
brown
color
but
not
anything
like
opaque
with
a
light
tan
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
so
much
more
like
a
typical
hefewiezen
than
i
expected
loads
of
hefe
yeast
in
the
nose
in
fact
thats
nearly
all
taste
is
pretty
much
typical
hefe
too
bananna
and
clove
plus
wheat
but
both
the
smell
and
taste
have
a
little
something
extra
i
guess
it
would
be
a
caramelized
malt
but
it
does
not
have
nearly
the
impact
that
color
would
make
me
guess
it
would
have
the
other
thing
is
that
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
masked
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
as
well
this
beer
is
pretty
interesting
and
really
well
done
overall
sad
to
say
i
dont
think
aging
is
the
best
thing
to
do
with
a
bottle
of
aventinus
aging
has
reduced
the
complexity
of
this
beer
in
aroma
flavor
and
even
mouthfeel
with
the
only
recompense
being
more
candisugarlike
sweetness
not
a
good
tradeoff
as
an
interesting
experiment
i
recommend
trying
this
especially
alongside
a
bottle
of
regular
aventinus
but
i
personally
cant
imagine
drinking
this
vintage
beer
without
pairing
it
with
very
specific
food
items
the
most
sugary
roasted
sweet
meats
some
desserts
worth
a
try
but
not
a
revelation
by
any
means
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
low
the
beer
is
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
overall
i
have
had
this
one
alot
fresher
and
i
seem
to
recall
it
being
better
fresh
oh
well
i
will
give
this
one
another
drink
next
week
drinkability
is
good
but
to
find
another
2000
is
most
likely
impossible
drinkability
unlike
other
fruity
beers
it
had
more
staying
power
it
didnt
get
any
worse
or
more
plain
as
i
drank
more
quality
beer
but
not
as
deep
as
the
best
ones
it
says
its
8
but
i
couldnt
tell
where
the
alcohol
was
its
hidden
extremely
well
and
i
hardly
felt
it
either
bananas
and
a
malty
sweetness
in
the
taste
heavy
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
carbonation
leaves
the
taste
of
cloves
in
the
aftertaste
but
the
finish
is
fairly
empty
second
glass
tastes
better
than
the
first
with
the
sediment
adding
some
complexity
straightforward
and
drinkable
but
nothing
stellar
bham
uk
d
another
please
i
pick
up
more
tomorrow
absolutely
fabulous
d
used
a
standard
weizen
glass
for
pouring
this
one
which
worked
out
perfectly
with
its
typical
weiss
head
and
rich
color
spectrum
i
enjoyed
the
beer
less
as
it
warmed
however
for
the
deeper
aspects
of
the
taste
and
smell
the
appealing
parts
of
the
beer
to
me
began
to
fade
as
this
happened
that
lessens
my
overall
scoring
in
the
smell
and
taste
category
as
well
as
this
one
when
i
first
started
sampling
the
beer
it
was
quite
good
and
remained
above
average
throughout
but
the
decrease
in
its
otherwise
great
attributes
led
me
to
conclude
it
as
above
average
instead
of
purely
excellent
i
could
however
drink
this
relatively
often
on
its
positive
aspects
alone
i
cant
say
enough
about
this
beer
i
have
had
many
many
great
beers
since
that
day
in
baltimore
nearly
five
years
ago
but
i
keep
coming
back
to
aventinus
my
first
love
this
is
an
amazing
complex
brew
i
have
not
had
another
brew
quite
like
this
if
you
havent
had
it
you
need
to
get
it
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
tasty
treat
supremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
so
many
flavors
might
lead
to
sensory
overlaod
but
the
beer
is
well
balanced
with
the
fruit
and
spice
and
slight
chocolate
all
complimenting
each
other
nothing
gets
in
the
way
of
anything
else
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
although
the
alcoholic
effects
do
kick
in
after
consumption
so
this
is
one
to
limit
to
one
bottle
and
sip
and
savor
mouthfeel
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
pours
a
dark
tawny
brown
hazy
aroma
is
spicy
and
rich
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ever
orange
peel
cinnamon
slightly
peppary
quite
fizzy
with
tiny
little
bubbly
head
flavor
leans
toward
malty
with
a
slight
citrus
slight
sour
edge
perfect
like
that
caramelish
malts
are
evident
is
balance
the
sour
something
very
very
nice
but
unexplainable
in
the
finish
uber
satisfying
to
drink
very
little
hop
presence
i
am
a
hop
head
but
would
not
mess
with
this
beer
and
add
more
top
beer
verdict
sweet
sweet
nectar
this
is
loaded
with
flavor
but
its
not
raucous
or
overbearing
its
complex
and
mysterious
a
wonderful
delicious
beer
the
taste
jesus
what
can
i
say
about
the
taste
its
got
the
prominent
malty
characteristics
of
a
doppelbock
it
has
the
crisp
clean
taste
of
a
hefeweizen
plus
the
overthetop
banana
and
wheattaste
of
a
dunkel
theres
a
huge
yeast
presence
in
the
aftertaste
vinous
and
grape
flavors
are
abounding
seriously
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
i
could
drink
this
for
days
on
end
and
never
stop
but
that
would
probably
destroy
my
social
life
and
my
family
and
really
who
wants
to
talk
about
that
damn
a
great
beer
this
is
my
first
wheat
doppelbock
so
i
do
not
have
a
comparison
the
presentation
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
wonderful
i
just
dont
care
for
the
smell
as
much
getting
back
on
topic
here
the
appearance
is
brownish
orange
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
spicy
like
cloves
or
cinnamon
but
not
as
pungent
as
either
of
those
the
taste
brings
out
a
bit
more
fruitiness
much
like
a
wheat
beer
and
the
spice
is
still
evident
medium
bodied
and
easy
on
the
palate
for
an
8
abv
beer
i
didnt
know
the
abv
until
i
wrote
this
review
and
i
would
have
guessed
that
this
was
less
than
8
drinkability
was
good
but
i
was
ready
to
try
something
else
after
this
beer
actually
i
was
ready
to
put
my
head
down
on
my
pillow
and
go
to
sleep
after
this
beer
since
it
was
preceded
by
a
dfh
world
wide
stout
haha
aventinus
was
like
a
wheat
beer
with
a
kick
to
it
and
although
wheat
beers
are
not
my
favorite
this
was
pretty
tasty
footnote
i
had
a
second
much
fresher
bottle
and
it
did
not
pour
as
well
as
the
older
one
drinkability
i
find
this
beer
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
this
style
it
is
extremely
drinkable
but
at
3
19
per
500ml
bottle
i
wont
be
drinking
a
lot
of
it
had
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
soft
white
head
mild
carbonation
with
very
tiny
bubbles
rising
to
the
surface
smell
was
strongly
wheat
with
clove
but
also
had
some
roastedtoasted
aroma
taste
was
very
interesting
lots
going
on
for
me
the
clovelike
wheat
flavor
dominated
initially
and
was
followed
by
a
slight
roasted
flavor
with
a
strong
fruity
sweet
and
sour
finish
a
very
fullbodied
beer
that
sticks
to
your
tongue
very
flavorful
but
hard
to
have
more
than
one
this
is
a
deceptively
drinkable
beer
the
high
abv
can
creep
up
on
you
unawares
as
it
hides
it
beautifully
beautifully
balanced
wonderfully
enjoyable
i
will
buy
this
again
and
recommend
to
friends
a
great
beer
and
even
though
they
are
very
different
styles
this
tastes
very
much
like
leffe
brune
but
dialed
up
a
notch
pours
with
a
noisy
crackling
active
head
of
small
and
medium
sized
pale
tan
bubbles
the
head
quickly
dissipates
leaving
a
brief
collar
there
are
tons
of
carbonation
streams
charging
to
the
top
through
a
beautiful
burnt
amber
copperhighlighted
liquid
smells
fruity
and
rich
with
cloves
bananas
and
raisins
distinctly
wheat
the
first
taste
is
initially
bracing
with
alcohol
but
this
immediately
disappears
and
the
rich
malty
sweetness
with
the
cloves
and
bananas
appear
there
are
lingering
alcohol
notes
which
are
warming
medium
bodied
with
vibrant
carbonation
slightly
slick
but
relatively
light
on
the
tongue
absolutely
drinkable
perhaps
dangerously
so
this
was
fantastic
and
worth
tracking
down
pours
a
translucent
brown
with
a
decently
thick
head
smells
of
caramel
figs
almonds
maybe
some
vanilla
tastes
very
strong
of
dried
fruit
and
caramel
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
made
it
have
a
robitussinlike
mouthfeel
drinkability
wasnt
so
high
tastes
great
but
towards
the
end
i
was
a
bit
overwhelmed
this
beer
poured
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
is
good
for
a
wheat
beer
but
then
the
monstrous
head
eventually
drops
to
nothing
which
i
think
is
typical
for
most
of
the
german
weiss
bier
that
ivd
had
the
aventinus
has
a
certain
lightly
spiced
caramel
apple
fruitiness
to
it
which
surfaces
in
the
aroma
too
that
is
rather
tasty
and
hides
the
alcohol
content
of
this
brew
pretty
well
i
seem
to
remember
the
spiciness
being
more
assertive
but
perhaps
my
palate
has
changed
and
not
the
beer
i
found
lots
of
yeast
in
the
bottle
and
i
tried
to
rouse
it
so
it
would
fall
into
my
glass
to
add
more
flavor
i
did
appreciate
the
soft
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
and
its
surprising
drinkability
but
for
all
the
hype
i
think
it
could
be
a
bit
more
complex
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
despite
my
criticism
the
mouth
feel
changes
with
temperature
as
it
is
cold
the
carbonation
is
very
light
but
it
peaks
as
it
warms
up
to
a
full
mouth
of
foamy
bubbles
and
dies
down
again
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
the
fact
that
i
figured
this
out
is
a
testament
to
its
drinkability
great
beer
only
the
banana
really
differentiates
this
from
a
bsd
to
my
palate
morphing
dark
flavors
reminds
me
of
maudite
a
bit
but
this
is
heavier
and
sweeter
great
to
have
on
occasion
i
was
suprised
to
see
how
dark
the
color
of
this
beer
is
the
smell
is
also
much
different
than
i
expected
much
more
carmel
and
fruity
than
i
guessed
but
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
taste
the
fruits
come
through
strong
but
dissapear
a
little
too
quickly
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
hoegaarden
forbidden
fruit
in
that
they
are
infusing
many
tastes
together
it
almost
creates
a
winelike
idea
very
pleased
this
is
an
excellent
dark
wheat
beer
from
germany
mabye
as
good
as
it
gets
definitely
one
of
the
best
i
would
say
top
five
examples
of
darker
wheat
beers
in
the
world
i
really
love
it
and
buy
it
at
every
opportunity
it
has
a
clovey
taste
with
a
subtle
maltiness
overall
the
beer
is
amber
but
is
a
true
example
of
the
darker
wheat
beers
it
is
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
so
try
to
buy
it
as
soon
as
you
can
the
head
on
it
is
perfect
and
the
beer
has
a
great
overall
body
excellent
with
sausages
or
just
by
itself
this
is
truly
a
remarkable
beer
this
brew
has
a
dark
reddish
brown
plumlike
color
with
a
nice
head
and
lots
of
fizz
the
smell
is
complex
and
fruity
maybe
a
hint
of
raspberry
in
there
there
is
a
nice
acidic
tarty
sweet
taste
followed
by
a
solid
bitter
finish
with
some
spiciness
at
the
end
its
full
bodied
and
the
high
carbonation
lifts
you
right
up
for
8
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
definitely
worth
stocking
up
on
this
one
cannot
find
any
sense
of
the
alochol
in
the
flavor
the
taste
just
knocked
me
off
the
couch
the
wheat
provides
a
nice
sweet
base
but
is
extremely
pronounced
by
strong
banana
and
cloves
the
cloves
pick
up
a
bit
to
a
slight
hop
presence
that
creates
a
wonderful
balance
got
bits
of
chocolate
raisins
and
prunes
coming
through
as
well
mouthfeel
is
light
but
has
a
full
body
that
just
wraps
itself
around
the
inside
of
my
cheeks
so
easy
to
drink
either
on
its
own
or
with
dessert
a
bunch
of

my
only
fear
is
that
there
wont
be
any
of
this
left
next
time
i
go
to
buy
beer
d
well
at
the
price
8
abv
and
5l
bottles
this
isnt
the
ideal
session
beer
although
any
session
with
this
beer
would
be
a
wonderful
session
indeed
it
is
sweet
but
well
rounded
enough
to
be
an
excellent
compliment
to
a
meal
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
it
is
my
favorite
beer
to
date
i
do
have
a
rochefort
10
in
the
fridge
though
weizenbocks
are
probably
my
favorite
style
i
wish
more
breweries
would
release
them
d
this
is
a
great
wheat
beer
that
has
increased
its
complexity
with
all
the
dark
malt
it
would
be
nice
to
taste
even
more
of
the
dark
qualities
to
compete
with
the
banana
flavor
and
other
flavors
of
lighter
german
wheat
beers
i
couldnt
drink
a
great
deal
of
this
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
this
beer
was
interesting
but
not
necessarily
in
a
good
way
it
poured
a
nice
orange
color
and
had
a
vigorous
foamy
head
the
aroma
was
very
fruity
with
no
hops
present
the
beer
had
a
sweet
maltiness
with
a
pronounced
apple
flavor
the
hops
were
very
subdued
and
provided
barely
enough
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
malt
the
body
and
mouthfeel
was
relatively
light
considering
the
alcohol
content
the
carbonation
was
very
high
almost
like
that
of
a
witbier
a
decent
beer
but
not
outstanding
in
my
opinion
notes
wouldnt
drink
this
every
day
as
wheat
beers
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
the
best
wheat
beer
or
bocks
ive
ever
had
definitely
one
i
will
pick
up
from
time
to
time
to
enjoy
for
a
change
of
pace
the
pour
is
orange
closing
in
on
lavender
the
head
seems
small
for
a
weizen
although
this
does
have
more
alcohol
then
the
average
hefe
leaving
minimal
lacing
its
got
the
phenols
and
esters
as
expected
a
malty
nose
with
bananas
and
cloves
the
taste
has
plenty
yeast
spice
fruit
in
addition
to
bananas
and
roasty
wheat
malts
the
8
abv
is
more
detectable
then
you
would
think
but
this
is
still
mighty
easy
to
drink
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
this
hophead
this
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
translucent
color
with
a
huge
head
that
quickly
disappeared
to
some
lacing
and
covering
the
surface
of
the
glass
some
citrus
smell
taste
began
with
an
astringent
taste
that
dissolved
into
a
citrus
flavor
i
have
had
some
problems
with
strong
astringent
tastes
like
konig
ludwig
hefe
weizen
this
beer
is
so
nicely
balanced
that
it
just
shows
you
an
astringent
taste
and
quickly
dissolves
to
at
citrus
taste
and
a
rich
mouthfeel
i
did
not
get
any
harsh
alcohol
taste
and
noticed
the
alcohol
only
in
a
slightly
flushed
feeling
and
a
nice
buzz
i
would
have
enjoyed
a
second
one
and
will
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
overall
an
exceptional
beer
in
my
view
the
best
of
its
kind
extremely
recommended
the
aroma
is
sweet
grapes
kind
of
winelike
accompanied
by
dark
roasted
malt
it
really
jumps
out
at
you
after
opening
the
bottle
the
taste
is
a
nicely
flavored
warming
alcohol
along
with
some
spicy
fruit
it
is
very
well
blended
between
these
two
flavors
there
is
also
a
nice
blend
with
malts
and
hops
goes
very
well
with
german
food
the
doublebock
style
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
very
good
beer
drinkability
i
found
this
to
be
extremely
drinkable
even
though
the
alcohol
levels
are
clearly
detectable
great
brew
500
ml
bottle
aventinus
pours
out
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
huge
head
vigorous
carbonation
the
aroma
is
wheat
dark
malts
chocolate
and
flowers
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
big
and
complex
yeast
wheat
bananas
sweet
n
sour
sauce
tropical
fruit
and
chocolate
there
are
so
many
delicious
flavors
in
this
beer
and
they
work
so
well
together
the
sweet
and
sour
flavor
lets
you
know
this
is
a
weizenbock
but
i
think
of
this
as
a
great
beer
that
just
happens
to
be
a
weizenbock
mouthfeel
is
creamy
the
relatively
high
carbonation
ensures
this
wont
be
cloying
a
world
class
beer
this
is
worth
a
try
if
for
nothing
else
to
taste
a
classic
and
elegant
portrayal
of
the
strong
dark
wheat
style
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
which
at
8
alcohol
makes
it
dangerous
an
excellent
doppelbock
though
having
this
celebrator
and
paulaner
salvator
in
my
fridge
at
the
same
time
is
making
me
really
appreciate
this
style
poured
from
a
pint
6
oz
bottle
with
the
yeast
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
fades
but
never
disappears
smell
is
sweet
and
estery
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
malty
and
bright
hints
of
traditional
weizen
flavors
like
clove
and
yeast
with
a
strong
malty
undertone
the
alcohol
flavor
is
not
nearly
as
strong
as
i
expected
but
its
definitely
there
nice
fruity
flavors
and
a
pleasant
carbonation
make
the
beer
seem
lighter
than
it
is
a
nice
clean
taste
and
feel
in
the
mouth
very
smooth
and
drinkable
but
it
sneaks
up
on
you
fantastically
drinkable
overall
aventinus
marries
intensity
with
grace
this
was
first
go
with
this
beer
for
me
but
its
a
clear
winner
a
complex
well
sculpted
beer
that
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
in
its
artistic
interpretation
of
a
style
go
get
one
and
drink
it
i
highly
recommend
this
delicious
wheat
dobblebock
drinkability
high
yeah
i
wouldnt
as
to
me
this
is
just
a
doubledunklewiezen
which
is
cool
but
a
regular
dunkles
are
a
damn
underrated
style
nice
aventinus
is
one
of
those
beers
i
have
always
consumed
and
almost
take
for
granted
recently
i
ordered
a
batch
from
my
local
store
thoughit
had
been
a
while
and
i
felt
like
rediscovering
it
in
its
absence
i
found
a
new
appreciation
for
this
phenomenal
beer
just
seeing
the
attractive
purplelabelled
bottle
is
enough
to
make
me
salivate
i
want
it
at
my
local
store
for
good
because
this
is
truly
a
world
class
german
beer
it
always
pours
into
my
weizen
glass
nicely
if
done
slowly
and
carefully
the
head
can
be
as
enormous
as
you
see
fit
ultracreamy
offwhite
bubbles
form
and
give
off
the
wonderful
aroma
very
intensely
after
pouring
sheets
of
lace
cover
the
sides
sticking
tenaciously
or
sometimes
running
down
the
glass
the
beer
is
full
of
colour
purples
and
burgundy
caramel
or
murky
brown
ruby
maple
and
amber
always
impermeable
too
the
beer
looks
thick
and
hazy
the
beers
appearance
literally
induces
drinking
the
first
big
chunky
aroma
from
this
beast
is
the
banana
fresh
strong
almost
rotten
banana
smells
dried
banana
the
intense
banana
is
not
artificial
smelling
at
all
as
some
unfiltered
wheat
beers
smell
as
though
they
have
had
banana
extract
dumped
into
them
this
is
refreshing
natural
and
extremely
appetising
behind
the
fruitiness
is
the
strong
sweet
maltiness
with
a
little
of
the
warming
portlike
alcohol
the
yeastiness
is
delicious
reminding
me
of
the
very
first
german
hefeweizens
i
ever
tried
dates
prunes
light
licorice
plums
and
red
wine
the
malts
add
some
saltiness
some
meatiness
this
is
one
beer
very
easy
to
oversniff
the
aroma
is
massively
complex
yet
very
powerful
sometimes
you
can
smell
it
too
much
and
it
numbs
your
nose
for
a
few
minutes
the
aroma
is
intense
and
can
be
overpowering
but
only
if
you
let
it
the
aroma
is
like
a
very
good
hefeweizen
with
the
addition
of
more
alcohol
and
more
maltiness
which
begs
the
question
why
are
there
not
more
weizenbocks
in
this
world
again
i
could
go
on
and
on
about
the
smells
in
this
beers
aroma
but
we
must
move
on
to
the
taste
the
taste
could
inevitably
be
compared
to
rich
red
wine
there
literally
is
a
very
strong
red
grape
taste
in
the
beer
even
the
tannic
dryness
is
present
the
finish
clearly
evinces
that
this
is
a
beer
thoughstrong
banana
yeastiness
perfumy
hops
and
rich
malting
the
alcohol
does
come
through
quite
strongly
in
the
middle
but
it
is
never
overpoweringinstead
it
reminds
me
of
the
taste
one
might
get
from
warm
brandy
delectable
dark
fruits
and
mouthfilling
maltiness
there
are
enough
strong
tastes
here
to
deter
the
second
sip
of
a
beerneophyte
but
once
this
beer
hacks
its
way
to
your
beerheart
this
is
at
once
both
one
of
the
most
refreshing
and
complex
strong
beers
you
could
ingest
think
the
revitalising
characteristics
of
a
cold
hefe
with
the
arcane
complexity
of
an
aged
barleywine
the
carbonation
on
this
beer
is
medium
the
mouthfeel
definitely
full
a
beer
equally
satisfying
on
a
cold
night
or
a
warm
one
i
have
tried
aventinus
with
a
variety
of
different
cheeses
and
they
all
complement
it
very
well
try
aged
cheddar
or
gorgonzolathey
were
particularly
good
with
this
beer
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
truly
does
make
germany
the
preeminent
beer
producer
and
it
is
one
of
those
beers
that
we
should
feel
privileged
to
experience
every
time
we
take
a
sip
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
typically
not
my
style
of
beer
but
im
really
starting
to
like
weizenbocks
super
easy
to
drink
alcohol
well
hidden
malty
and
sweet
makes
me
wish
i
bought
more
than
1
bottle
i
great
change
of
pace
for
me
definately
seek
this
one
perfect
for
a
cool
autumn
evening
compare
with
victory
moonglow
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
but
not
worthy
of
the
price
not
a
bad
1
but
nothing
special
here
either
one
truly
great
brew
this
is
the
first
beer
im
rereviewing
in
a
different
serving
type
why
cause
its
freakin
great
poured
into
my
big
ole
weizen
glass
the
head
took
up
half
the
height
at
first
the
bubbles
swirled
around
like
living
organisms
until
they
settled
into
sweet
beer
once
i
tasted
this
the
malts
and
banana
flavors
were
brilliantsweet
rich
beautiful
poifect
this
is
unique
i
dont
know
of
any
other
beers
that
taste
like
this
or
look
like
it
its
dark
purple
dear
heavens
you
have
to
try
this
just
to
say
you
did
or
because
its
one
of
the
best
brews
out
there
great
bold
innovative
try
it
my
friend
last
time
i
had
this
was
i
was
sipping
it
in
the
weisses
brauhaus
am
tal
in
munich
this
time
from
the
bottle
pours
a
cloudyyeast
orangetinted
brown
with
about
an
inch
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
standard
collar
smell
is
rich
and
full
of
banana
bread
clove
and
loads
of
yeast
spicemalty
and
sweet
taste
upfront
is
deep
caramelized
banana
wheatiness
the
hefe
characteristic
is
magnified
to
epic
proportions
very
round
flavor
then
theres
a
slow
progression
into
a
warming
clove
finish
hops
are
nominally
present
for
bittering
only
delicious
delicious
banana
burps
mouthfeel
is
low
medium
but
the
carbonation
is
strong
working
to
create
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
not
unlike
some
belgian
strong
ales
utterly
drinkable
at
8
but
one
is
more
than
enough
for
my
tastes
i
still
prefer
standards
doppels
pours
to
a
white
head
and
cloudy
amber
color
aroma
is
strong
in
esters
especially
apple
banana
and
clove
maltiness
is
also
evident
in
the
nose
flavor
is
a
very
rich
blend
of
sharp
wheat
flavors
blended
with
fruity
and
spicy
flavors
contributed
by
the
yeast
alcohol
wafts
into
the
nasal
passage
as
it
dries
out
upon
swallowing
some
spicy
hop
notes
are
noticable
this
weizenbock
is
balanced
flavorful
potent
and
technically
flawless
its
always
a
good
way
to
end
a
day
to
dive
into
this
one
a
look
that
is
prototypical
of
a
dark
wheat
dark
mohogany
and
clearly
hazy
but
after
that
its
nearly
perfect
aromas
are
that
of
a
light
barleywine
with
bubblegum
juicy
fruit
and
esters
banannas
and
cloves
the
flavors
are
intensely
similar
bigger
and
bolder
sweetness
than
expected
in
wheat
beers
but
complex
and
bold
nonetheless
more
akin
to
and
urbock
so
is
the
body
texture
and
mouthfeel
wheatlike
maltybready
flavors
show
nicely
from
nose
to
finish
sweet
and
malty
in
the
finish
and
with
a
fruity
warming
aftertaste
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
i
paid
4
50
for
this
500ml
i
believe
and
will
certainly
grab
it
again
the
next
time
i
see
it
handle
with
care
8
abv

if
you
like
a
weizenbock
you
wont
be
able
to
put
it
down
i
bought
it
out
of
state
12
years
ago
and
i
believe
that
it
gets
better
with
age
but
since
you
can
now
get
it
in
nc
i
will
be
cleaning
out
my
stash
for
things

it
was
worth
the

sure
tastes
delicious
a
fullbody
beer
strong

complex

balanced
like
many
other
reviewers
of
this
beer
its
my
first
weizenbock
but
it
will
not
be
my
last
this
is
an
awesome
beer
what
a
beer
what
a
beer
its
hard
to
talk
about
appearance
when
youre
drinking
the
beer
from
the
bottle
in
the
toilet
of
a
busy
library
but
mmm
sniffing
the
mouth
of
the
bottle
i
am
bombarded
by
pleasant
weizen
flavors
and
thats
just
foreplay
the
real
action
happens
when
it
put
the
bottle
to
my
mouth
and
wow
so
good
this
beer
is
everything
a
weizen
should
be
and
since
its
a
dunkelweizen
it
is
a
little
less
oppressively
sweet
than
your
standard
hefeweizen
if
you
havent
already
drank
this
beer
go
out
and
buy
it
now
overall
drinkability
is
decent
i
like
this
beer
just
fine
and
will
buy
it
again
but
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
and
at
nearly
five
dollars
a
bottle
these
are
a
bit
steep
on
the
price
for
regular
consumption
i
wish
i
hadnt
had
aventinus
as
my
first
weizenbock
but
either
way
im
certainly
getting
some
more
regardless
off
what
kind
of
beer
is
your
favorite
a
bottle
of
this
is
cheap
enough
to
try
and
even
it
wasnt
you
should
at
least
try
this
nice
medium
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
alchohol
warmth
flavor
is
clove
and
prune
with
a
hint
of
banana
and
vanilla
surrounded
by
a
malty
grainy
wheat
body
a
hint
of
salt
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
taste
is
classic
dunkleweissen
with
a
heavy
dose
of
malty
bock
just
like
you
would
expect
but
amazing
how
smooth
they
are
together
a
fair
amount
of
tartness
if
you
let
it
linger
in
you
mouth
a
bit
this
is
an
awesome
beer
with
tons
of
complexity
taste
even
changes
a
bit
as
it
warms
and
as
you
get
into
more
yeast
toward
the
bottom
it
becomes
more
bready
this
is
my
first
wheat
doppelbock
but
trust
me
it
wont
be
my
last
a
very
very
good
beer
md
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sharp
upfront
turning
more
and
more
creamy
and
rounded
towards
the
end
as
the
alcoholic
texture
turns
softer
in
strength
and
thinnercleaner
on
the
palatebetween
the
teeth
a
remarkable
beer
it
is
much
much
more
flavoursome
than
its
cousin
schneider
weisse
original
id
go
for
single
bottle
each
time
as
its
very
powerful
and
hard
to
digest
if
consumed
too
much
a
beer
with
characters
to
savour
rather
than
quaff
other
comments
weissbier
was
my
first
love
as
far
as
beer
is
concerned
so
a
superweiss
like
this
one
brings
back
those
good
ol
days
poured
into
a
aventinus
glass
deep
dark
brown
in
color
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
huge
tan
head
which
takes
awhile
to
disapate
tons
of
lacing
left
from
the
middle
out
to
the
edges
i
could
smell
grassy
chocolate
spicy
and
fruity
scents
tastes
like
a
hefeweizen
but
with
a
more
doppelbock
flavor
very
nice
has
a
medium
body
with
a
slight
taste
of
alcohol
but
not
that
much
considering
it
is
a
8
abv
very
drinkable
its
a
keeper
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
off

caramel
chocolate
the
taste
is
above
reproach
huge
clove
and
banana
flavors
with
some
darker
caramel
tones
lurcking
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
think
and
juicy
overall
this
is
one
outstanding

if
i
could
only
find
it

its
probably
a
coincidence
but
this
fine
beer
gives
a
pleasant
alcokick
more
likely
the
name
is
taken
from
the
roman
hillock
mons
aventinus
it
was
orginally
a
workers
residential
area
but
was
quickly
gentrified
and
filled
with
villas
baths
and
temples
the
most
famous
being
the
one
devoted
to
diana
the
godess
of
nature
in
the
middle
ages
the
hill
was
apppropriated
by
monastic
establishments
and
they
are
still
there
enough
of
that
its
a

review
aventinus
the
beer
rules

the

some
notes

with
notes
of

the

very
well
medium
mouthfeel
was
not
overly
heavy
and
not
to
wimpy

finished
a
bit

very
nice
this
is
a
great
all
round
beer
highly
recommended
yearlater
edit
an
amazingly
complex
and
balanced
weizenbock
truly
the
standard
of
the
style
with
notes
of
apple
vinegar
sweet
maple
syrup
and
white
wine
a
must
try
rendition
of
a
unique
style
im
not
keen
on
this
style
yet
im
having
a
hard
time
getting
into
the
wheat
feel
in
general
i
will
explore
learn
and
return
later
very
dark
with
a

moderate

with
a

bite
going
down
the
high
alcohol
was
not
noticed
at
all
very
smooth
drinkability
after
the
first
sip
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
will
continue
to
buy
this
and
will
drink
again
and
again
in
all
this
is
a
beer
that
is
among
the
best
in
my
book
definately
in
my
top
ten
this
is
an
insanely
easydrinking
beer
esp
considering
its
abv
ive
never
had
a
weizenbock
before
and
im
kicking
myself
for
waiting
this
long
to
try
one
this
will
be
an
outstanding
beer
for
the
winter
months
and
its
pretty
damn
good
on
a
dog
day
in
august
appearance
cannot
be
improved
deeep
rich
looking
frothy
head
it
actually
spoke
to
me
i
think
its
alive
and
it
will
not
die
smells
of
some
banana
and
caramel
but
so
enriched
that
it
smells
like
a
poutpouri
with
some
raisin
or
plum
in
the
background
as
well
just
beautiful
all
around
i
had
this
with
the
intention
of
a
prenightcapper
but
i
could
see
this
as
an
after
dinner
brew
to
seal
the
deal
something
strong
enough
to
compete
with
the
dinner
yet
rich
and
easy
drinking
not
to
bloat
or
disturb
mouthfeel
was
awesome
creamy
some
oils
carbonation
makes
its
point
then
fades
quickly
like
alot
of
german
brews
if
i
did
believe
in
a
god
it
would
have
to
be
the
person
that
perfected
this
recipe
perfection
opinion
this
beer
is
world
class
and
i
dont
know
how
anybody
could
possibly
dispute
that
fact
i
rarely
drink
wheat
beers
in
general
unless
they
have
a
ton
of
funk
from
the
senne
valley
this
is
the
only
other
wheat
beer
that
i
will
drink
on
a
regular
basis
because
of
the
simple
fact
that
it
is
incredibly
tasty
the
fact
that
it
was
brewed
according
to
the
reinheitsgebote
makes
it
even
more
amazing
because
they
were
able
to
get
all
of
these
flavors
with
only
four
ingredients
awesome
overall
a
good
beer
to
try
once
but
its
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
slàinte
a
pretty
solid
brew
slightly
disappointing
for
me
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
this
beer
has
an
eight
percent
abv
as
it
is
so
easy
to
sip
and
enjoy
without
tasting
any
alcohol
this
is
an
absolute
killer
doppelback
and
a
steal
at
3
a
bottle
pours
a
beautiful
brownish
red
slight
haze
after
pouring
the
rest
of
the
500ml
bottle
medium
head
with
medium
bubbles
smells
of
caramel
grain
and
a
hint
of
ripeoverripe
fruit
light
clove
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
medium
to
heavy
body
that
feels
velvety
to
the
mouth
and
tongue
powerfully
rich
and
deep
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
taste
outstanding
yeast
and
caramel
in
the
aftertaste
a
wonderful
brew
for
a
coolcold
night
everything
is
just
about
perfect
down
to
the
chosen
serving
size
drinkability
and
overall
its
an
ok
brew
just
not
quite
my
cup
of
tea
too
sweet
too
overpowering
no
balance
and
definitly
no
focus
ive
not
had
too
many
weizenbocks
but
i
know
enough
about
them
to
realise
there
is
much
more
a
weizenbock
can
be
than
this
not
bad
pours
a
beautiful
deep
mahogany
clouded
by
the
thick
yeast
common
to
schneiders
beers
huge
bubbly
head
that
quickly
fizzes
away
also
common
to
schneiders
beers
big
big
aroma
with
pear
banana
dark
wheat
bread
even
a
hint
of
apple
cider
this
beer
smells
so
good
i
almost
forgot
to
drink
it
but
drink
it
i
must
the
flavors
of
schneiders
original
weisse
are
all
here
whole
wheat
banana
bread
lots
of
yeast
except
they
are
all
magnified
threefold
plenty
of
the
caramelly
doppelbock
character
and
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
alcoholic
zing
is
there
but
nothing
suggesting
the
8
abv
of
course
youll
notice
the
8
by
the
time
youre
finished
with
the
bottle
but
what
the
hey
aventinus
is
a
worldclass
luxurious
beer
from
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
breweries
if
you
like
schneiders
original
aventinus
will
be
absolute
heaven
for
you
truly
a
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
hype
im
going
to
be
drinking
more
than
a
few
of
these
in
the
future
final
thought
wow
i
had
this
ontap
at
the
weisse
brauhaus
in
munich
and
didnt
realize
how
good
it
was
in
bottle
form
a
world
class
beer
from
a
favored
brewery
in
the
world
capital
of
bocks
and
weizens
this
is
a
world
class
beer
in
my
opinion
very
close
to
flawless
what
a
great
experience
i
cannot
recommend
this
highly
enough
to
those
who
enjoy
a
change
of
pace
a
taste
experience
or
are
looking
for
a
summer
bockstyle
ale
definitely
try
this
if
you
can
500
ml
bottle
date
coding
is
too
many
numbers
to
figure
out
dunno
how
i
missed
rating
this
one
have
had
on
draft
and
in
bottles
many
times
since
becoming
a
ba
had
to
go
out
and
get
this
bottle
to
review
pours
dark
ruby
with
a
gargantuan
head
the
aromas
of
banana
and
clove
that
i
associate
with
most
wheat
beers
are
here
but
less
dominant
allowing
more
subtle
richer
aromas
of
fruit
cake
and
a
little
caramel
to
come
through
pleasant
mouthfeel
with
a
refreshing
finish
manages
to
take
the
standard
weisse
beers
to
another
level
and
add
complexity
while
still
keeping
it
balanced
and
refreshing
dn
definitely
worth
the
wait
to
try
this
one
this
is
a
beer
to
sit
back
with
and
savor
a
heavy
strong
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
thanks
again
to
biglove
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
brew
drinkability
if
you
like
wheat
beer
and
dopplebock
but
especially
the
rather
this
is
very
great
i
will
buy
this
one
every
chance
i
get
very
nice
fairly
easy
to
drink
for
8
abv
this
went
well
with
grilled
salmon
but
was
even
better
after
dinner
overall
this
is
a
hell
of
a
beer
its
probably
going
into
my
top
10
no
3
at
the
moment
based
on
my
score
i
very
highly
recommend
it
especially
for
weizen
fans
and
superespecially
for
fans
of
dunkles
bier
this
one
was
a
good
find
at
the
beer
store
a
3
year
old
aged
aventinus
specially
packaged
from
the
information
hanging
off
the
bottle
therefore
in
1999
the
schneider
brewery
decided
to
age
240
cases
of
aventinus
each
year
in
their
historical
ice
cellar
in
kelheim
with
each
batch
held
for
a
minimum
of
3
years
the
result
is
quite
yummy
pours
light
brown
in
color
with
a
haze
smell
is
of
bananas
and
yeast
taste
is
heavenly
bananas
lemon
juice
minimal
cloves
i
wish
i
had
a
new
one
to
compare
against
perhaps
this
is
worth
another
trip
back
to
the
store
5
49
for
500ml
bottle
if
you
see
it
it
is
worth
it
label
says
hints
of
softer
chocolate
clay
and
sherry
when
aged
excuse
me
if
i
didnt
pick
up
on
all
of
these
drinkability
resonabley
priced
for
such
an
excellent
and
common
weizenbock
try
it
on
for
size
i
know
i
will
try
it
again
drinkability
a
good
beer
but
it
did
not
leave
me
wanting
another
i
dont
know
if
my
mood
is
right
or
what
but
i
was
satisfied
with
just
this
one
bottle
i
may
purchase
it
again
nice
complex
though
wellstructured
brew
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
decent
body
and
fairly
clean
finish
has
me
giving
this
an
above
average
drinkability
despite
the
abv
in
fact
everyone
at
the
table
is
eyeing
my
glass
and
normally
id
split
the
second
half
of
this
bottle
amongst
them
not
today
this
one
came
up
from
louisiana
courtesy
of
biglove
thanks
and
i
dont
have
any
spares
overall
a
must
have
this
is
a
very
approachable
high
abv
beer
for
almost
anyone
500
ml
bottle
with
a
batch
code
on
the
back
served
slightly
chilled
in
a
weizen
glass
the
initial
pour
leaves
6
inches
of
head
to
3
inches
of
beer
but
looks
very
nice
the
other
way
around
it
takes
several
minutes
to
fit
the
whole
bottle
into
the
glass
before
the
yeast
it
is
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
and
after
it
is
close
to
maroon
and
opaque
lots
of
phenols
bananas
cloves
pepper
lemons
chocolate
alcohol
yeast
and
sweet
sugary
notes
in
the
aroma
it
has
a
medium
body
a
carbonation
that
is
a
bit
sharp
at
the
beginning
and
leaves
a
warming
sensation
flavors
include
bananas
cloves
pepper
grass
caramel
bubblegum
chocolate
raisins
plums
a
sugary
sweetness
alcohol
and
yeast
a
good
brew
but
and
i
dont
usually
say
this
it
might
benefit
from
less
alcohol
nevertheless
a
tasty
beer
for
the
price
overall
i
knid
of
went
back
and
forth
on
this
beer
it
looked
and
smelled
great
but
then
i
hated
the
taste
as
it
warmed
i
started
to
like
it
more
and
more
but
its
definitely
not
one
of
my
new
favorites
a
wonderfully
crafted
beer
i
will
defiantly
be
looking
for
this
in
the
future
i
really
reccommend
this
beer
great
great
weeizenbock
the
standard
by
which
others
should
be
judged
pours
a
caramel
brown
into
the
glass
with
about
12
inch
head
smell
is
malty
some
banana
taste
is
exquisite
caramel
toffee
banana
some
nice
yeasty
spiciness
mouthfeel
is
full
rich
creamy
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
a
higher
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
medium
to
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
without
being
harsh
if
i
didnt
see
the
8
on
the
bottle
i
would
have
thought
this
was
in
the
high
5
range
because
i
could
drink
this
all
night
drinkability
man
if
you
keep
these
too
cold
you
could
easily
drink
2
or
3
of
these
monsters
and
end
up
on
your
face
the
classic
example
of
the
style
outstanding
i
had
begun
to
lose
faith
in
the
wheatier
beers
until
this
one
came
along
finally
a
wheat
beer
with
some
backbone
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
shades
of
amber
shining
through
the
same
delicate
yeasty
bananna
flavorings
are
there
yet
theres
a
nice
rich
malt
presence
to
back
it
up
plenty
of
complex
spices
and
herbalness
too
very
cakelike
sugary
and
chocolatey
yet
with
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
and
overall
light
vibe
it
must
be
a
challenge
to
brew
a
beer
that
is
so
light
in
character
yet
so
complex
bravo
we
sampled
this
prior
to
the
last
sports
and
social
club
game
of
the
season
for
volleyball
we
enjoyed
the
brew
and
took
the
field
with
smiles
on
our
faces
the
game
was
won
and
we
were
propelled
into
the
finals
many
thanks
to
goodbyeohio
for
the
hook
up
of
the
awesome
brew
i
dont
know
exactly
what
i
expected
i
think
i
presumed
it
would
be
darker
it
was
good
but
not
as
wonderful
as
i
presumed
it
would
be
ive
had
only
a
few
weizenbocks
but
this
is
certainly
an
expansion
of
my
senses
prosit
kind
of
tastes
like
fruit
juice
but
definitely
has
the
weight
and
body
of
fruit
juice
plus
carbonation
overall
i
think
my
expectations
were
a
little
too
high
for
this
beer
but
its
definitely
one
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
again
i
had
this
in
a
vertical
with
a
fresh
aventinus
and
a
99
aventinus
the
fresh
one
was
very
clovey
and
bananany
with
a
nice
wheat
base
and
semisweet
malt
flavor
the
99
was
much
more
dark
chocolatey
and
vicious
in
mouthfeel
with
a
heartier
flavor
almost
port
like
the
01
was
inbetween
it
still
had
that
spicey
hefe
flavor
but
not
as
intense
and
it
had
more
port
chocolate
notes
than
the
fresh
one
kind
of
inbetween
and
a
little
muddled
i
think
aged
aventinus
is
prime
after
6
years
this
was
still
an
awesome
beer
but
not
quite
as
good
as
either
the
fresh
one
or
the
99
fun
experiment
though
presentation
packaged
in
a
16
9
ounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pop
top
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
from
bottle
oh
my
loved
this
right
from
the
first
sniff
pours
translucent
goldy
brown
with
big
foamy
light
tan
head
and
plenty
of
fine
effervescence
big
estery
aroma
with
sweet
caramel
banana
and
clove
tones
aroma
is
true
to
the
taste
and
it
is
so
smooth
that
the
reasonably
high
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
yum
bummer
now
i
have
to
go
back
and
downrate
my
old
favourite
weinstephan
hefeweissbeir
comments
despite
the
appearance
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
sort
of
odd
as
well
because
it
has
some
characteristics
commonly
found
in
ales
fruitiness
gritiness
overall
id
say
this
is
a
complex
beer
despite
my
score
id
recommend
it
to
almost
anyone
no
dating
that
i
can
understand
what
is
stamped
on
it
is
04
163
0386
13
and
2822
hazy
and
unclear
dark
chestnut
with
just
a
bit
of
a
pale
copper
ring
of
tiny
bubbles
and
a
few
dibs
and
dabs
of
islands
here
and
there
nice
strong
scents
banana
and
cloves
wonderfully
spicey
sasafrass
fresh
ginger
even
maybe
good
amount
of
carbonation
you
can
really
feel
it
as
it
foams
up
a
bit
and
expands
in
your
mouth
interesting
flavors
not
too
strong
yet
in
no
way
is
it
mild
nice
and
malty
just
slightly
dark
there
is
a
hit
of
sasafrass
and
a
lot
of
nice
clove
in
the
finish
even
a
bit
of
a
clove
tingle
on
the
tongue
i
like
that
and
have
always
loved
the
taste
of
clove
goes
down
nicely
with
a
lot
to
think
about
and
enjoy
in
this
one
not
too
heavy
but
may
be
best
as
a
sipper
or
with
a
good
cheese
plate
im
glad
i
tried
this
but
i
doubt
ill
have
it
again
one
never
knows
do
one
just
the
thought
of
the
sweetness
makes
me
cringe
debating
on
getting
this
again
but
without
a
doubt
the
eisbock
will
be
a
repeat
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
orange
highlights
frothy
creamcoloured
head
with
good
retention
strong
banana
aroma
in
the
nose
with
a
little
hint
of
clove
wheat
malt
tang
with
some
almost
bubble
gumlike
sweetness
followed
by
lots
of
banana
esters
and
some
cloves
very
very
slight
alcohol
warmth
in
the
lingering
aftertaste
but
very
minimal
nice
heavy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
quite
a
tasty
beer
and
exceedingly
drinkable
i
could
drink
these
all
night
i
think
this
might
have
been
the
first
5
i
gave
out
mediumfull
body
and
exceptionally
smooth
very
enjoyable
brew
this
would
be
a
great
beer
on
a
chilly
night
sitting
in
front
of
fire
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
caramel
amber
color
with
a
lasting
lacing
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
unique
blend
of
spicey
lager
yeast
fruity
ale
yeast
and
estery
hefe
yeast
behind
all
that
is
a
thick
sweet
raisincaramel
malt
aroma
that
lingers
the
malt
sweetness
dominates
the
flavor
drifting
between
raisin
caramel
malt
and
sweet
wheat
malt
before
giving
way
to
a
yeast
finish
the
beer
is
viscuous
on
the
tongue
and
finishes
warmly
this
beer
definitely
takes
the
winter
chill
away
and
likely
the
winter
blues
as
well
murky
brown
with
a
12
inch
white
head
that
rises
for
a
bit
and
lingers
throughout
the
experience
nose
is
of
spices
and
a
tinge
of
fruit
i
believe
i
detect
a
trace
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
in
the
nose
roasted
malts
give
it
a
deep
flavor
reminiscent
of
toffee
and
light
chocolate
taste
is
fruity
at
first
with
red
apple
plum
and
bananna
being
prevalent
spices
are
more
evident
near
the
middle
of
the
glass
again
with
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
just
a
smidgen
mind
you
cloves
also
not
enough
to
overpower
just
perfect
there
is
a
carameltoffee
sweetness
to
this
ale
a
perfect
balance
of
strength
and
wheat
mouthfeel
is
spicy
and
carbonated
a
perfectly
drinkable
ale
especially
on
a
cold
rainy
winters
day
just
compared
to
ramstein
winter
wheat
ramstein
blows
this
formidable
foe
away
especially
with
less
awlkeehawl
detection

alright
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
folks
the
perfect
marriage
of
wheat
ale
dopplebock
shear
perfection
i
would
love
to
try
this
with
some
bread
pudding
a
onetwo
punch
of
sweet
and
sour
somewhat
simplistic
lacking
in
depth
and
disappointing
overall
this
was
a
disapointment
it
pours
reddish
orange
with
a
eggshell
head
some
lacing
the
malts
were
just
too
cloying
this
offset
a
little
bit
by
cloves
but
not
enough
it
did
serve
as
a
deecent
winter
warmer
but
the
sweetness
really
cut
down
on
drinkability
i
can
see
the
love
for
this
beer
but
i
just
wasnt
feeling
it
an
awesome
beer
no
question
about
it
i
wish
i
had
more
in
my
fridge
weizenbocks
are
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beers
its
clear
that
the
schneider
aventinus
is
one
of
the
best
out
there
highly
recommended
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
its
easy
to
suck
this
one
right
down
and
let
that
8
abv
get
right
on
top
of
you
an
excellent
choice
for
an
after
dinner
beer
watch
out
tho
this
beer
goes
down
amazingly
easy
for
an
8
poured
a
hazy
brown
thick
rich
head
that
retained
and
left
puffy
lacing
all
the
way
through
smell
was
vanilla
slight
clove
bread
taste
is
of
clove
spice
complex
and
delicious
mouthfeel
is
rich
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
excellent
great
beer
one
of
the
best
in
my
opinion
cheers
must
try
all
in
all
a
drinkable
dopplebock
but
it
is
just
not
my
style
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
so
i
have
to
give
it
props
notes
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
such
a
well
done
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
although
it
wont
be
in
my
regular
rotation
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
it
is
best
as
an
end
of
the
night
its
time
to
have
one
last
beer
and
go
to
bed
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
a
pint
or
two
will
be
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
all
said
a
very
unique
beer
and
well
worth
trying
pours
with
a
big
head
that
subside
rather
quickly
aroma
is
very
intense
and
fresh
on
initial
taste
it
seems
a
bit
thin
but
quickly
releases
nice
clove
flavor
very
warming
but
refreshingly
so
not
much
aftertaste
lingering
but
one
can
feel
the
alcohol
well
after
swallowing
this
beer
kind
of
resembles
some
of
the
belgium
characteristics
i
enjoyed
this
but
feel
like
it
needed
more
body
and
staying
power
poured
dark
brown
with
a
short
lived
off
white
head
nutty
malt
aroma
with
spices
medium
to
thin
mouthful
wheat
is
definitely
present
in
the
taste
along
with
some
chocolatecoffee
notes
and
some
clove
like
spices
a
little
too
yeasty
im
not
sure
what
it
was
but
there
was
something
a
bit
harsh
here
yet
unremarkable
not
a
bad
beer
i
guess
i
was
just
expecting
more
tastes
strongly
of
cloves
and
sugar
which
give
a
sense
of
mystery
and
strength
to
this
beer
although
at
8
it
is
insanely
drinkable
and
way
too
thirst
quenching
despite
the
significant
lack
of
aftertaste
this
beer
is
very
complex
and
waddles
through
the
dark
fruit
taste
profile
reminding
me
of
some
of
my
favorites
i
really
like
this
beer
and
even
bought
the
funky
glass
that
it
is
served
in
so
i
could
be
as
authentic
as
possible
halftime
has
the
eisbock
glass
which
is
a
sawed
off
version
of
the
regular
glass
aventinus
weizen
is
a
beer
the
i
loved
from
the
moment
i
had
it
first
time
back
in
the
german
time
still
love
it
and
everytime
that
i
can
get
a
hold
of
it
fresh
ill
buy
and

makes

it
doesnt

the

you
would

thsi
is
one
wonderful

concoction
which
unfortuantely

enjoy
one
asap
overall
this
was
a
marvelously
complex
beer
very
similar
in
tone
to
wolnzacher
roggenbier
and
the
fact
that
the
high
malt
content
comes
primarily
from
wheat
malt
gives
this
beer
an
interesting
character
that
few
other
beers
can
match
recommended
the
alcohol
made
its
presence
known
as
the
beer
warmed
but
in
a
complementary
way
this
along
with
the
carbonation
induced
light
mouthfeel
leads
to
great
drinkability
but
beware
itll
sneak
up
on
you
the
reddish
orange
to
burnt
amber
looking
body
surprised
me
with
its
initial
clarity
and
the
lack
of
cloudiness
the
second
pour
however
had
a
large
number
of
floating
clumps
of
the
little
friends
the
initial
head
was
an
inch
and
a
half
in
height
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
the
head
did
not
last
very
long
at
all
and
there
was
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
smell
was
perfumey
to
medicinal
alcohol
with
underlying
banana
clove
and
ripe
cherries
the
taste
was
initially
quite
sweet
with
lots
of
fruity
esters
and
spices
typical
for
a
german
wheat
beer
the
alcohol
appears
to
be
very
well
hidden
at
first
but
as
the
beer
warms
up
it
starts
to
step
in
front
of
other
flavors
and
introduces
a
lot
of
dryness
in
the
mix
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
the
hops
make
a
surprisingly
strong
appearance
there
is
a
faint
smokiness
to
the
malt
that
is
like
a
wispy
ghost
mouthfeel
is
not
as
creamy
as
i
had
hoped
for
and
the
yeast
adds
a
mildly
unpleasant
metallic
twang
very
complex
beer
that
starts
out
easy
and
then
changes
its
tune
a
couple
of
times
as
it
has
your
attention

this
is
probably

anyone

beers
must
try
an
aventinus
you
will
not
regret
it
even
if
you
dont
love
it
as
much
as
i
medium
to
full
body
more
carbonated
than
i
thought
it
would
be
a
little
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
still
a
fabulous
beer
good
beer
medium
bodied
and
crisp
good
drinkability
for
the
abv
feel
like
i
could
have
a
couple
pours
a
nice
cloudy
copper
under
a
voluminous
three
finger
beige
head
wiht
great
retention
and
firm
body
there
was
some
lacing
but
should
have
been
more
the
nose
is
a
wonderful
combination
of
the
strong
malt
expected
of
a
doppelbock
and
the
yeast
and
spice
of
a
hefeweizen
the
compliment
each
other
very
well
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
too
light
for
this
style
the
taste
is
ooh
so
smooth
with
lemon
and
coriander
on
top
of
a
good
barley
base
when
cold
there
is
no
noticeable
caramel
with
the
sweetness
far
more
citrus
than
candy
as
it
warms
though
the
candy
emerges
and
takes
over
leaving
a
very
sweet
aftertaste
from
the
final
swallow
there
are
no
discernible
hops
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
is
a
nice
enjoyable
drink
my
wifes
comment
after
a
sip
umm
unusual
yup
unusually
good
wow
this
is
an
interesting
beer
the
mouthfel
is
nice
and
soft
the
carbonation
is
very
subdued
which
seems
strange
to
me
given
the
massive
head
im
not
sure
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
due
to
the
alcohol
content
but
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
as
the
bar
maid
was
bringing
this
brew
to
us
it
almost
appeared
as
though
it
was
12
liter
of
purple
liquid
with
a
giant
fluffy
white
head
on
top
as
it
got
closer
i
realized
it
was
merely
a
deep
ruby
color
but
what
a
color
it
was
the
locals
at
the
table
tried
their
hand
at
english
with
us
giving
us
the
warning
that
this
beer
was
not
for
amateurs
taking
a
sniff
you
could
tell
this
beer
was
in
the
8
range
pretty
alcohol
smelling
as
i
took
the
first
sip
my
worries
of
it
tasting
like
pure
alcohol
were
put
to
ease
while
there
was
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
taste
there
was
plenty
of
malt
here
to
balance
that
out
a
bit
of
a
clove
taste
followed
it
as
well
it
was
a
lot
crisper
than
i
was
expecting
definitely
a
refreshing
bock
to
take
down
mid
day
the
head
is
big
noisy
and
collapses
unevenly
leaving
runny
spots
of
lacing
its
color
is
a
lightgraytan
the
beer
is
a
clear
dark
redbrown
the
yeast
pour
adds
a
slight
haze
spicy
nose
sweet
with
cream
the
front
is
tangy
tangy
fruit
green
apples
and
candy
sugar
with
temperature
that
tanginess
tames
to
the
point
where
some
banana
shows
sweet
fruit
in
the
middle
with
some
cream
the
creaminess
builds
as
the
beer
warms
turning
almost
milkchocolatey
tangy
again
in
the
finish
toffee
some
bread
lots
of
spice
some
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
really
needs
to
warm
up
to
bloom
when
cold
the
tangy
fruit
is
almost
overwhelming
with
temperature
the
fruit
softens
considerable
and
the
thick
malty
creamy
chocolatey
malt
starts
to
shine
through
stunningly
good
when
warm
its
like
a
good
fruity
creamy
dessert
poured
a
nice
dark
amber
with
an
immense
white
head
this
stuff
has
some
pretty
intense
aroma
grassy
notes
flooded
my
room
when
i
poured
this
into
a
glass
very
wheaty
smell
taste
is
pretty
interesting
to
me
this
beer
seems
to
blend
the
qualities
of
a
nice
german
wheat
and
a
nice
belgian
dark
ale
its
bubbly
and
complex
like
a
belgian
dark
but
also
very
wheaty
with
hints
of
banana
like
a
german
wheat
very
interesting
beer
its
a
nice
to
have
a
bottle
every
couple
of
weeks
or
so
while
i
felt
the
aventinus
weizeneisbock
was
good
but
perhaps
a
touch
overdone
this
beer
is
simply
outstanding
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
not
hesitate
to
have
one
in
the
future
it
might
be
a
little
bit
much
for
someone
to
have
repeated
pints
of
however
theres
a
reason
few
bars
have
doppels
on
tap
this
is
a
good
thing
something
8abv
that
goes
down
this
easy
should
have
some
sort
of
arresting
effect
the
taste
reveals
the
wheat
and
some
dark
malts
a
great
sensation
on
the
palate
the
beers
is
nicely
fruity
and
ends
on
a
very
pleasing
note
of
nuts
raspberries
some
caramel
too
the
hoppy
bitterness
was
almost
hidden
a
zest
of
lemon
very
nice
mouthfeel
very
smooth
you
feel
the
alcohol
after
a
few
sips
but
it
is
well
balanced
with
the
powerful
flavor
such
a
good
beer
i
could
have
many
of
these
why
am
i
sharing
this
bottle
with
my
friend
who
says
its
ok
overall
this
is
definitely
a
wow
beer
one
to
savor
wow
this
is
bottled
ersatz
ecstasy
back
to
the
lcbo
for
more
i
hope
it
cellars
well
id
heard
so
much
about
this
beer
as
a
top
20ish
beer
so
i
was
glad
to
come
across
the
wrapped
bottle
in
akron
im
glad
i
did
too
since
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
the
dark
barley
malt
and
wheat
malt
mix
very
nicely
into
a
unique
experience
and
certainly
one
id
hope
to
have
again
in
the
future
bottled
wow
came
out
a
little
fizzy
but
the
head
died
down
immediately
the
color
is
a
slightly
cloudy
brown
malty
wheat
and
cloves
make
for
a
rich
taste
undertones
of
alcohol
but
doesnt
overpower
the
taste
nose
is
a
bit
floral
also
hints
of
clove
very
full
taste
very
good
this
bottle
was
aged
for
a
year
and
a
half
it
was
much
better
than
when
new
drink
till
you
cant
overall
this
is
just
a
tasty
beer
i
will
definitely
return
to
this
from
time
to
time
a
good
first
impression
i
look
forward
to
many
more
of
these
the
wheat
doppelbock
pours
a
amazing
apple
cider
in
appearance
and
color
all
sorts
of
very
fine
yeast
sediment
visible
impossibly
tight
carbonation
sits
as
a
thin
ring
around
the
edges
of
the
beer
only
to
foam
and
billow
up
as
i
swirl
the
glass
low
to
moderate
lacing
of
the
glass
aromas
are
all
over
the
place
fruits
by
the
truckload
with
ripe
banannas
and
granny
smith
apples
leading
the
way
a
spicy
almost
peppery
zip
as
well
i
didnt
note
the
chocolate
that
others
have
smelled
flavor
is
complex
large
dose
of
grainlike
flavor
initially
followed
by
a
quick
burst
of
sweetness
then
ends
with
a
strange
mix
of
peppery
bitterness
almost
an
acidicdry
finish
warming
effect
from
the
alcohol
becomes
more
prominent
at
the
very
end
decent
body
and
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
as
well
for
as
complex
a
beer
at
this
is
it
comes
off
very
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
a
keeper
aventinus
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
im
not
sure
what
i
expected
from
a
weizenbock
but
this
wasnt
it
its
a
little
too
sour
a
little
too
dry
and
way
too
carbonated
ill
probably
give
it
another
go
sometime
since
this
may
not
have
been
a
properly
cared
for
bottle
the
alcohol
was
hidden
so
well
this
could
be
lethal
for
a
session
after
a
12l
i
was
already
struggling
i
will
definetely
get
this
again
this
is
a
very
good
complex
beer
that
i
think
has
improved
greatly
with
3
years
in
a
cave
i
am
going
to
buy
more
of
these
if
i
see
them
for
sure
i
honestly
had
no
foreknowledge
or
expectations
about
this
strange
wheat
doppelbock
it
just
looked
good
and
it
was
on
sale
it
has
proven
to
be
an
indispensable
beer
drinking
experience
i
could
not
otherwise
imagine
was
possible
overall
i
still
prefer
the
original
nonaged
version
in
all
its
wonderful
wildness
especially
at
half
the
price
but
this
was
still
a
fantastic
beer
some
may
say
i
am
nuts
but
i
have
noted
the
smell
and
taste
of
bubble
gum
at
times
bubble
gum
is
this
beer
the
answer
is
no
its
ambrosia
spicy
fruity
notes
of
figs
raisins
along
with
a
big
clove
flavour
that
if
overpowering
mediumfull
bodied
slick
with
robust
pinpoint
carbonation
it
starts
as
simply
lovely
to
look
at
then
carries
through
as
wonderful
to
the
last
drop
in
the
bottle
the
full
flavor
and
spicy
character
give
it
a
big
and
true
identity
as
full
a
beer
as
it
is
though
it
ever
sacrifices
being
refreshingly
drinkable
even
the
relatively
high
abv
remains
well
hidden
and
doesnt
seem
to
wreak
any
havoc
it
promises
big
things
them
keeps
those
promises
a
trait
that
makes
it
something
to
keep
close
by
like
in
your
refrigerator
in
quantity

you
always
know
the
next
ones
there

meats
to
see
if
that
enhances
the
experience
i
was
having
it
with
pasta
and
cheeses
and
the
food
seemed
to
stop
the
beers
tastes
not
sure
about
this
one
smell
was
that
of
raisins
and
prunes
but
the
taste
was
a
bit
unbalanced
imo
at
times
smooth
and
at
other
times
a
bit
harsh
sound
weird
well
it
was
maybe
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
to
begin
with
hard
to
finish
a
whole
glass
for
me
but
i
definitely
appreciate
it
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
5
year
old
beer
this
is
my
favorite
beer
hands
down
i
read
many
of
the
reviews
on
aventinus
that
talk
about
how
great
this
beer
is
on
tap
i
have
unfortunately
never
had
this
beer
on
tap
but
it
is
hard
to
imagine
it
being
more
exquisite
than
it
is
out
of
the
bottle
i
first
had
this
beer
at
the
silver
swan
in
new
york
city
while
eating
wild
boar
and
venison
it
is
a
great
beer
to
accompany
a
heavy
meal
it
is
a
great
dark
weisse
and
right
after
you
open
the
bottle
you
can
smell
the
distant
smells
of
banana
and
cloves
once
you
taste
this
beer
you
will
be
astounded
by
the
flavor
it
is
8
alcohol
but
goes
down
smooth
and
if
you
arent
careful
after
a
few
you
will
definitely
feel
it
i
recommend
aventinus
to
anyone
and
if
anyone
knows
where
i
can
find
it
on
tap
in
the
nynj
area
let
me
know
huge
bubbly
head
that
mounds
high
above
the
rim
of
the
class
nice
clear
deep
brown
color
until
the
last
pour
when
the
yeast
pours
and
slowly
falls
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
eventually
recedes
to
a
sparse
bubbly
lace
clove
and
other
spices
stand
out
in
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
plum
and
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
medium
mouth
feel
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
that
gives
a
fluffiness
to
the
mouth
feel
sweet
dark
fruity
malt
up
front
followed
by
clove
and
some
yeast
notes
a
touch
of
citric
hop
comes
in
towards
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
also
a
bit
noticeable
towards
the
end
and
ever
so
slightly
warming
the
clove
flavor
lasts
into
the
long
aftertaste
along
with
some
of
the
alcohol
very
pleasurable
brew
to
drink
again
and
again
yet
not
one
that
id
consider
a
session
brew
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
definately
my
favorite
doppelbock
to
date
in
brief
liquid
bubble
gum
without
the
sugar
a
substitute
for
people
who
drink
white
sweet
wines
but
do
not
care
for
beer
taste
tasted
like
fruit
flaroured
bubble
gum
alcohol
well
covered
colour
included
also
banana
cloves
nutmeg
some
wheat
brown
body
with
orange
highlights
topped
by
a
fistsized
beige
head
of
microbubbles
topped
by
a
dollop
of
whip
cream
rising
above
the
glass
a
punch
in
the
nose
of
bananas
clove
and
bubblegum
taste
starts
off
very
sweet
first
with
some
candy
followed
by
some
dark
fruits
and
finally
a
dash
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
to
take
the
edge
off
the
sweetness
still
a
little
sweeter
than
i
would
ideally
prefer
i
expected
the
mouthfeel
while
hardly
classifiable
as
thin
to
be
slighty
fuller
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
however
i
will
say
that
my
local
ramstein
winter
wheat
is
even
better
still
this
is
a
style
to
be
reckoned
with
and
this
is
one
of
the
standard
bearers
update
great
from
bottles
also
but
i
prefer
the
tap
imagine
aventinus
then
imagine
aventinus
with
less
sweetness
more
balance
and
one
of
the
smoothest
taste
you
will
ever
experience
i
cant
say
enough
about
this
ecstasy
is
the
word
rivals
any
beer
i
have
ever
had
while
weizens
are
not
my
favorite
style
i
was
intrigued
by
the
doppelbock
aspect
of
this
particular
brew
pours
a
hazy
amber
brown
color
with
a
very
nice
head
that
slowly
receeded
little
or
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
very
grassy
aromaspicyclovesyeasty
yeasty
comes
thru
in
the
flavorsome
phenolssourness
very
pleasant
mouthfeelfull
bodied
and
high
level
of
carbonation
slight
puckering
effect
which
i
like
overall
a
very
nice
beerwouldnt
be
my
first
choice
but
is
a
great
change
from
the
stoutipaamberetc
routine
that
the
average
beer
drinker
consumes
id
have
another
this
is
my
desert
island
beer
and
has
been
for
awhile
interesting
to
actually
write
a
review
the
taste
was
just
a
bit
less
appealing
than
the
appearance
i
tasted
hints
of
chocolate
and
spice
and
was
left
with
an
overall
sweet
taste
the
typical
grainy
wheat
taste
was
also
very
noticeable
but
not
offensive
as
it
has
been
for
me
in
other
weizen
beers
overall
this
is
the
best
weizen
beer
ive
ever
had
and
ill
not
hesitate
to
pick
up
another
overall
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
that
made
me
sit
back
and
examine
what
was
going
on
with
the
beer
flavorwise
kinda
mysterious
like
as
in
what
am
i
tasting
here
well
balanced
and
fun
to
drink
i
think
as
many
people
who
drink
it
will
describe
it
differently
a
good
beer
to
compare
directly
with
someone
else
this
beer
is
the
king
of
dark
wheat
2000
vintage
caved
aged
for
36
months
in
aventinus
ice
cave
in
germany
the
appearance
is
very
similar
if
not
the
same
as
regular
aventinus
a
dark
yeasty
murky
brown
colour
with
a
humungous
tanbeige
head
of
foam
if
swirled
or
allowed
to
garner
up
a
big
head
the
aromas
of
this
are
also
very
similar
to
the
regular
aventinus
i
smell
cloves
various
fruits
and
esters
slight
spicy
alcohol
a
bit
of
malt
and
very
very
slight
floral
hops
the
aromas
are
actually
a
bit
more
well
integrated
than
the
aromas
of
the
regular
aventinus
but
at
the
same
time
they
are
also
less
pronouncespungent
and
complex
the
taste
is
more
subdued
than
that
wildfresh
aventinus
but
all
of
the
same
major
flavor
hints
are
still
there
slight
bittersweet
chocolate
dark
fruits
german
yeast
malt
and
hops
alcoholic
spiciness
and
spicy
clove
hints
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamier
and
more
smooth
in
the
mouth
than
fresh
aventinus
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
for
an
8
0abv
wheat
beer
please
remember
to
serve
this
cool
not
cold
at
cellar
temperature
because
this
is
were
aventinus
is
at
its
best
since
these
99
and
2000
reserve
bottles
have
been
aged
in
an
ice
cave
for
36
months
they
should
be
served
straight
from
you
ice
cave
ie
cellar
or
brought
up
to
cellar
temp
by
sitting
in
the
fridge
for
3040
minutes
pours
with
a
big
fizzy
head
of
large
airy
white
bubbles
that
quickly
dissipates
into
nothing
at
all
btw
i
had
not
cleaned
my
tasting
glass
with
detergent
or
a
towel
so
im
at
a
loss
as
to
why
theres
no
head
what
a
downer
the
beer
itself
is
wellcarbonated
though
with
plenty
of
streamers
rising
through
a
lightchestnut
colored
brew
with
highlights
that
border
on
amber
immediately
weizeny
aroma
up
front
with
the
distinctive
refreshing
nearcitrus
tartness
there
follows
a
bananabread
mealiness
in
the
middle
with
toffee
malt
rounding
out
the
back
flavor
is
of
clove
and
slight
cinnamon
sourwheaty
with
suggestions
of
bubblegum
and
melon
in
the
midpalate
with
spicy
clove
highlights
of
raisin
and
white
grapes
and
oh
yeah
a
lot
more
cloveso
much
that
it
almost
borders
on
black
pepper
if
you
dont
like
clove
then
forget
it
mouthfeel
is
spicily
dry
effervescent
champagney
with
more
peppery
tingle
yet
somehow
quenching
in
the
back
of
the
throat
this
combination
of
spiciness
and
quenching
character
infers
a
high
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
in
session
if
i
wasnt
feeling
the
alcohol
already
i
might
try
this
again
to
see
if
the
appearance
score
goes
up
a
bit
but
for
now
lets
just
say
i
didnt
get
as
much
out
of
this
beer
as
i
had
hoped
overall
a
superb
brew
and
even
smoother
and
more
refined
after
aging
i
can
see
why
this
is
on
the
top
50
list
its
got
that
perfect
combination
of
wellblended
yet
complex
flavors
prosit
i
couldnt
remember
the
last
time
id
had
this
but
i
figured
that
since
i
was
bottling
my
own
weizenbock
today
i
should
drink
this
purple
beast
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
tinge
with
a
towering
tan
head
smell
rich
vinuous
character
with
sweet
hints
of
bubblegum
some
banana
and
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
tangy
champagne
banana
wheat
bread
acidic
yeasty
sour
apples
some
clove
finish
is
wheat
bitter
with
lingering
banana
yogurt
and
alcohol
delicious
big
and
uncompromising
yet
utterly
drinkable
i
can
only
hope
my
brew
turns
out
one
third
as
good
bought
a
1pt
9oz
bottle
for
2
49
totally
worth
it
for
this
amazing
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
of
all
time
its
not
often
that
i
give
a
5
for
taste
but
this
one
deserves
every
point
poured
a
cloudy
brown
hue
very
nice
fizzy
head
with
good
lacing
very
spicy
smell
can
smell
the
wheat
and
malts
right
away
tastes
amazing
not
sure
how
anyone
can
give
this
less
than
a
4
5
i
gave
it
a
five
wonderful
weizenbock
yummy
malts
and
fruity
spices
8
is
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
goes
very
well
with
almost
any
meal
try
it
out
im
sure
you
will
enjoy
it
reddish
dark
brown
with
a
gemlike
glow
substantially
tall
evenly
bubbled
light
tan
head
frothy
topped
and
whipped
with
a
few
divets
and
little
sparkly
specks
within
the
foam
fades
slowly
to
a
heavy
skim
always
present
but
very
little
lace
sticking
most
drips
back
in
aroma
is
citrusy
and
spicy
with
mild
lemon
and
orange
zest
mostly
coming
through
lighter
wheat
and
malty
sweetness
musty
yeast
and
clove
spices
engaged
within
taste
is
a
total
brigade
derived
from
the
smell
pretty
sharp
toned
up
front
with
a
strong
wheaty
carbonation
that
grabs
hold
right
away
and
sticks
with
ya
the
whole
ride
through
middle
strikes
with
a
yeasty
take
and
citrus
zest
of
lemon
and
orange
carbonation
finally
settles
out
and
leaves
prickly
notions
of
malted
sweetness
with
some
dark
fruityness
of
banana
and
starfruit
tangyness
and
spice
that
lingers
with
a
light
chewyness
that
smoothes
it
out
some
but
that
carbonation
really
stands
out
and
adheres
to
your
mouth
quite
a
ride
in
the
feel
dept
lots
of
hold
and
carbonation
that
creates
lots
of
those
little
burps
at
first
but
as
it
warms
it
mellows
and
becomes
more
gratifying
a
pretty
nice
brew
seemingly
one
dimension
in
a
way
but
complex
enough
to
keep
interest
and
finding
something
new
nearly
every
sip
makes
for
a
welcome
experience
and
favorable
enjoyment
taste
is
like
a
hefeweizen
on
steroids
with
a
maltier
presence
as
it
warms
very
flavorful
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
carbonated
but
otherwise
pretty
good
drinkability
is
above
average
good
beer
but
doesnt
seem
like
a
doppel
also
very
similar
to
trois
pistoles
drinkability
this
will
cause
me
to
give
even
more
wheat
beers
a
try
big
revelation
for
a
stout
guy
straight
high
marks
for
a
very
balanced
and
enjoyable
presentation
warm
alcohol
back
is
secondary
but
noticable
enjoyed
in
the
festive
enviroment
of
the
schneider
weiss
tap
house
in
munich
color
was
essentially
that
of
any
dunkel
weiss
possibily
with
a
slighter
deeper
brown
color
and
more
predominant
orange
hues
the
head
of
the
brew
was
extremely
thick
and
long
lasting
i
bet
i
coudve
floated
a
penny
on
the
top
of
it
notedid
not
try
flavor
was
particularly
heavy
in
the
aspects
of
bananas
and
even
offered
some
notes
of
flat
na
apple
cider
a
very
slight
taste
of
alcohol
could
be
tasted
mouthfeel
was
extremely
luxurious
and
thick
the
strength
of
the
flavors
did
however
slightly
detract
from
drinkability
there
are
others
i
prefer
to
be
drinking
but
id
never
knock
this
back
if
my
tooth
was
a
little
sweeter
these
days
i
would
have
rated
this
much
higher
there
is
no
doubt
aventinus
a
beauty
even
if
its
not
really
a
style
i
go
in
for
often
this
is
like
a
super
version
of
their
hefes
wild
stuff
throughly
enjoyed
it
probably
not
the
sort
of
thing
id
drink
every
day
but
definately
something
which
should
be
tried
completely
unique
and
enjoyable
this
must
be
a
rare
case
finding
this
stuff
on
tap
i
just
started
getting
aventinus
on
tap
at
mugs
alehouse
in
brooklyn
and
ive
never
seen
it
tapped
anywhere
else
before
i
have
to
admit
i
prefer
it
on
tap
over
bottled
though
aventinus
wheat
is
still
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
bottle
the
color
deep
brown
and
flavor
fruity
with
a
bit
of
cloves
are
still
excellent
i
think
the
tap
controls
the
carbonation
better
cutting
the
head
down
making
it
a
bit
heavier
and
giving
it
an
even
smoother
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
than
the
bottle
feels
a
bit
more
like
a
8
0
abv
beer
on
tap
and
it
will
catch
up
to
you
after
the
second
16oz
one
believe
me
cloudy
deep
red
to
brown
color
very
fruity
smelling
notes
of
ripe
plum
a
bit
of
banana
and
some
definite
clove
in
the
aroma
well
carbonated
pours
with
a
rousing
head
tastes
sharp
from
the
carbonation
there
is
some
definite
banana
flavor
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
lightly
sweet
has
a
light
bit
of
astringency
in
the
finish
the
dark
malt
adds
a
richness
to
this
beer
in
combination
with
the
yeast
it
gives
the
beer
dark
fruit
type
flavors
this
is
like
a
richer
more
chewy
fruitier
older
brother
of
a
great
hefeweizen
all
of
the
characteristics
are
here
just
more
so
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
wish
it
had
finished
with
a
slightly
higher
final
gravity
a
little
more
thickness
sweetness
would
have
been
ideal
nice
thick
foamy
head
light
tan
in
color
a
little
overcarbonated
though
theres
definitely
some
alcohol
present
in
the
aroma
mixed
in
with
some
yeast
and
banana
the
liquid
has
a
creamy
brown
color
to
it
the
alcohol
aroma
carrys
over
into
the
taste
and
ends
up
as
a
warm
feeling
in
you
belly
the
taste
is
just
a
little
bit
sweet
with
maybe
a
little
caramelized
banana
in
there
strong
but
smooth
beer
maybe
more
of
a
fall
beer
than
a
summer
one
gets
better
as
it
warms
prosit
open
it
up
and
out
poors
a
deep
cloudy
monster
with
a
thin
white
lace
smells
of
spices
and
clove
with
bits
of
fruit
and
alcohol
present
the
taste
is
spicey
with
no
hop
bitterness
present
the
alcohol
taste
is
present
but
subdued
by
the
wheatspice
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
yet
crisp
and
finishes
a
bit
dry
this
is
a
pretty
big
beer
and
pretty
complex
and
hard
to
describe
for
a
n00b
like
myself
but
all
i
know
is
i
like
it
pours
a
solid
dark
amber
with
a
light
head
the
essence
of
any
bock
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
redness
can
really
be
shown
but
in
a
medium
lit
room
it
is
a
very
nice
not
quite
black
amber
the
most
distinguishable
characteristic
of
this
beer
is
banana
it
is
overall
fruity
and
quite
sweet
but
the
banana
overshadows
all
other
flavors
present
are
chocolate
cola
nut
and
apple
there
is
not
initial
hit
to
the
pallete
rather
the
malt
steadily
accumulates
first
with
banana
flavor
then
trailing
with
the
others
as
it
warms
up
the
flavor
changes
noticably
becoming
even
sweeter
and
more
balanced
amongst
the
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
more
carbnated
than
most
other
dopplebocks
and
i
like
it
perhaps
im
partial
to
my
celebrator
but
this
beer
makes
a
great
substitute
for
dopplebock
when
you
need
some
variety
quite
solid
overall
not
something
i
could
see
drinking
a
ton
of
at
a
sitting
but
delightful
as
a
one
off
saved
this
one
for
a
while
its
one
of
my
favourite
beers
around
given
my
handle
pours
a
almost
cola
colour
with
a
nice
firm
head
when
poured
properly
the
nose
is
full
of
life
with
caramel
bananas
cloves
and
even
a
almost
light
tobacco
the
taste
is
the
nose
times
three
all
of
the
sences
are
hit
with
the
fruity
spicy
and
almost
cola
like
sensations
the
carbonation
just
lifts
these
onto
the
palate
and
makes
the
tongue
dance
with
joy
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
carbonation
keeps
this
from
being
to
heavy
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
through
back
if
not
for
the
fact
that
3
or
more
will
leave
you
hurting
due
to
its
abv
which
is
not
even
noticable
an
all
time
favourite
for
a
great
treat
drink
this
with
bananas
foster
for
dessert
now
if
i
could
keep
my
wife
from
drinking
half
of
my
tinus
id
be
a
happy
boy
deep
trouble
copper
appearance
with
a
nice
head
that
stayed
there
for
a
while
aroma
is
quite
complex
mayble
a
little
bit
fruity
and
even
roasty
alcohol
is
very
discreet
not
my
favorite
style
or
indeed
a
style
that
i
know
much
about
but
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
again
notes
this
is
the
first
beer
of
those
i
have
not
had
on
the
top
50
list
that
i
went
out
and
bought
based
on
ba
rank
i
now
understand
exactly
how
valuable
ba
is
as
a
resource
thanks
all
pours
with
a
nice
head
that
is
a
bit
craggy
for
a
wheat
beer
but
head
stay
throughout
the
drink
aroma
is
not
too
strong
with
a
bit
of
clove
to
suppliment
the
general
wheat
beer
breadish
aroma
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
body
and
which
i
think
comes
from
the
wheat
side
of
the
brew
but
the
finish
owes
more
to
the
bock
side
this
is
a
fairly
strong
brew
but
the
combination
of
characteristics
diguises
the
alcohol
and
you
would
be
tempted
to
make
this
a
session
brew
which
would
be
a
mistake
i
made
a
good
choice
of
beer
for
my
first
review
ive
never
had
a
wheat
doppelbock
before
tonight
i
was
always
told
that
this
was
a
beer
to
check
out
and
now
i
understand
why
i
was
never
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
in
general
just
a
little
too
sour
for
my
tastes
really
but
a
wheat
bock
this
beer
smells
like
a
wheat
beer
but
the
taste
is
exactly
half
sour
wheatness
half
malty
bockness
an
excellent
balance
with
lots
of
flavor
might
be
my
new
favorite
beer
i
dont
think
it
gets
any
more
dangerous
for
the
average
beer
drinker
than
this
a
perfectly
constructed
weizen
that
is
highly
drinkable
and
an
8
abv
awesome
to
look
at
in
an
aventinus
glass
while
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
my
wife
loves
it
now
and
i
will
be
on
the
hunt
for
more
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
one
of
these
again
thankfully
i
can
find
it
however
due
to
the
serving
size
and
richness
this
would
probably
be
the
only
bottle
id
be
consuming
that
night
i
highly
highly
recommend
trying
this
it
goes
a
step
beyond
the
doppelbocks
half
a
liter
bottle
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
it
pours
a
dark
muddy
brown
almost
like
chocolate
milk
with
4
huge
fingers
of
head
there
is
almost
no
lacing
left
on
the
glass
despite
the
huge
head
the
smell
is
super
malty
and
yeasty
and
very
full
of
clove
spice
it
smells
like
a
dunkelweizen
on
steriods
the
taste
is
also
packed
with
malt
and
cloves
and
also
contains
some
fruity
esters
there
is
a
bit
of
yeast
to
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
super
smooth
the
drinkability
is
also
fairly
good
for
being
8
0
my
first
taste
of
this
style
and
im
already
wondering
how
anything
could
come
close
to
this
time
to
drink
a
good
beer
for
a
change
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
with
swirling
yeasts
and
enormous
thick
tan
head
that
i
could
barely
contain
in
the
glass
be
sure
to
swirl
the
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottleits
imperative
smells
of
bread
with
nutella
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
and
some
spices
clove
sweet
rich
tastes
of
dough
up
front
with
sweet
dark
fruits
in
the
middle
smoothed
by
a
banana
flavor
from
the
yeast
and
some
cloves
and
a
warming
alcohol
sensation
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
8
abv
wouldnt
know
it
until
the
end
this
is
an
amazing
complex
drinkable
and
flavorful
beer
big
beautiful
head
dissipated
at
a
moderate
pace
dark
red
color
with
a
lot
of
big
bubbles
of
co2
aroma
is
very
fine
with
a
slight
estery
character
that
is
very
spicy
and
clovelike
taste
is
a
balance
of
sweet
and
dry
malt
flavors
starting
with
a
dark
brown
sugar
flavor
and
a
dry
balance
there
is
a
definite
carbonic
bite
in
this
one
that
somewhat
detracts
from
the
flavor
very
smooth
clean
finish
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
lot
of
clove
and
spicey
esters
mouthfeel
is
light
despite
the
high
alcohol
drinkable
as
long
as
it
is
paired
with
the
right
foods
or
the
right
moods
an
excellent
brew
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
winters
evening
with
some
good
cigars
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
save
for
the
abv
i
could
keep
on
drinking
this
but
id
be
whacked
in
short
order
that
said
this
is
an
excellently
crafted
beer
wholly
worthy
of
the
praises
sung
on
its
behalf
by
bas
in
countless
forum
threads
add
another
devotee
to
the
list
you
all
know
what
the
bottle
looks
like
i
poured
it
out
of
that
its
a
rather
intimidating
yet
somehwat
appealing
hazy
murky
deep
mahogany
colour
massive
beige
head
on
the
pour
spilling
over
bursting
at
the
seams
but
that
soon
fades
away
leaving
me
to
deal
with
the
matter
at
hand
the
nose
is
quite
nice
never
noticed
it
much
before
now
rather
inviting
spicy
and
rummy
hints
of
preserved
fruit
like
the
jarred
cherries
my
baba
used
to
make
quite
intense
flavour
is
very
similar
its
something
ive
yet
to
find
the
words
for
wet
ikea
throwrug
is
not
it
though
i
stand
corrected
like
spiced
buttered
rum
mixed
with
fruit
and
then
that
elusive
special
ingredient
oh
yeah
banana
thats
it
yeah
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
not
the
cats
ass
like
everyone
else
makes
it
out
to
be
but
not
as
bad
as
i
first
took
it
to
be
either
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
im
willing
to
give
it
the
respect
it
deserves
id
rather
have
a
unibroue
instead
i
think
i
will
update
reviewed

and
raising
the
mouthfeel
from
4
0
to
4
5
this
beer
is
utterly
consistant
from
year
to
year
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
lacey
head
has
a
full
maltfruty
smell
that
comes
through
in
th
taste
with
the
higher
abv
i
doubt
i
will
be
drinking
too
many
in
one
sitting
but
at
has
a
nice
body
and
a
all
around
very
nice
beer
another
truly
wonderful
beer
proving
that
once
again
this
world
is
full
of
new
tastes
to
be
explored
granted
this
one
is
quite
old
but
it
was
new
to
me
basically
this
beer
is
pure
germany
im
not
sure
if
its
the
high
alcohol
content
or
what
but
this
beer
really
tastes
like
a
fresh
wheat
dunkel
as
if
youre
in
germany
notes
absolutely
beautiful
ripe
fruit
characteristics
begin
to
rage
as
beer
warms
john
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
be
happy
with
glass
after
glass
i
originally
sampled
this
brew
many
moons
ago
i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
complex
aroma
when
poured
its
nice
frothy
head
dies
down
quickly
its
dark
amber
in
color
w
a
flavor
of
cloves
w
hints
of
banana
its
a
nice
beer
but
for
my
taste
its
nothing
too
exciting
at
3us
a
bottle
i
wont
get
it
again
not
that
its
bad
tasting
it
doesnt
justify
the
cost
for
me
when
poured
into
my
glass
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
head
with
medium
sized
bubbles
the
nose
was
that
of
clove
and
i
could
definitely
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
i
just
couldnt
acquire
a
taste
for
this
beer
i
thought
it
had
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
to
each
hisher
own
overall
highly
anticipated
and
now
much
respected
aventinus
is
a
legend
well
worth
the
hype
dopplebocks
are
one
of
the
most
fascinating
styles
and
this
is
an
amazing
interpretation
of
such
if
you
see
it
buy
it
its
that
simple
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
nice
big
creamy
headthe
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
ans
clovey
has
a
banana
pudding
quality
to
it
with
some
chocolate
wafer
toneslike
some
of
the
others
i
think
this
a
pretty
complex
beer
a
little
heavy
in
the
stomach
so
its
not
a
highly
drinkable
beer
for
mebut
a
great
complex
beer
this
beer
would
be
fantastic
late
fall
with
a
homemade
apple
pie
perhaps
covered
with
some
melted
chedder
and
a
scoop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
this
stuff
is
loaded
with
spicy
appleraisin
cinnimon
clove
and
even
a
dusting
of
cocoa
powder
the
fruitiness
is
faint
while
the
waves
of
flavor
attack
with
cheerful
willingness
over
and
over
again
a
warmth
from
the
alcohol
is
present
throughout
the
experience
with
some
noticeable
heat
on
the
palate
in
addition
a
near
perfect
bitterness
keeps
the
beer
in
check
this
is
cool
stuff
but
after
one
im
done
for
a
whilekinda
like
cheese
fries
the
low
drinkability
reflects
my
personal
idea
of
drinkability
which
perhaps
reflects
the
season
in
which
i
have
sampled
a
particular
beer
drinkability
to
me
means
when
i
have
finished
a
fairly
regulation
size
serving
drinking
the
beer
i
say
man
id
really
really
like
to
experience
that
again
and
very
soon
at
that
pours
a
light
mahogany
color
and
is
topped
with
a
beige
fizzy
head
that
runs
away
quickly
nose
is
full
and
sweet
fruity
and
malty
flavor
is
very
rich
and
sweet
primarily
of
strong
malt
plus
some
plum
highlights
a
slight
alcohol
aftertaste
lingers
on
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
rich
to
have
high
drinkability
this
brew
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
pour
with
a
very
lively
medium
head
full
of
medium
sized
bubbles
it
has
a
very
mild
cloven
aroma
the
body
contained
some
yeast
residue
floating
in
it
its
taste
leaves
a
lasting
impression
on
your
tongue
as
it
goes
down
it
has
a
very
nice
taste
with
a
hint
of
raisin
and
at
the
top
of
my
list
but
not
the
very
top
after
a
few
drinks
the
alcohol
content
really
comes
through
initial
aroma
of
apple
cider
eventually
leads
to
aromas
of
wheat
and
a
slight
phenolic
waft
poured
a
reddishbrown
in
color
with
a
nice
head
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
come
out
more
as
the
beer
warms
caramel
and
dark
fruit
are
the
most
dominant
flavors
spicy
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
leaving
a
nice
tang
very
nice
i
wouldnt
necessarily
call
it
to
style
but
damn
is
it
good
a
good
brew
thick
rich
flavourful
deep
dark
brown
pour
with
an
enormous
foamy
head
light
hoppy
nose
with
underlying
hints
of
chocolate
and
plum
lovely
mouthfeel
flavours
of
light
unsweetened
chocolate
raisin
plum
a
hint
of
banana
and
a
spicey
finish
including
some
clove
nutmeg
of
course
there
is
a
noticeable
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
very
warm
beer
but
yet
not
heavy
it
stays
light
on
the
tongue
and
refreshes
and
yet
is
intense
and
complex
in
its
flavours
a
classic
in
my
book
overall
very
enjoyable
example
of
the
variety
the
reinheitsgebot
purity
law
can
offer
a
well
made
dark
rich
beer
that
satisfies
you
could
drink
more
than
one
but
one
scratched
my
beer
itch
highly
recommended
conclusion
aging
doesnt
hurt
but
doesnt
increase
the
complexity
or
depth
of
flavor
to
as
great
a
degree
as
id
figured
it
would
drink
it
fresh
for
best
effect
imo
but
if
you
have
an
aged
bottle
or
two
its
still
a
wonderful
brew
another
pickup
from
beer
meccasee
half
time
beerfly
it
had
a
fizzy
bubbly
white
head
it
was
a
deep
and
cloudy
leather
color
with
tons
of
carbonation
bubbles
fizzing
to
the
top
i
liked
this
beer
better
than
the
celebrator
it
had
a
richer
more
distinct
aroma
full
of
berry
bouquets
and
a
hearty
yet
refreshing
wheat
smell
the
taste
was
yeasty
and
fizzy
but
perfectly
balanced
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
musty
a
damp
like
a
piece
of
water
logged
wood
a
hearty
ammount
of
spiced
ginger
etc
flavoring
but
nothing
artifucial
kinda
resembled
an
iced
tea
very
good
500ml
bottle
i
am
a
big
fan
of
weizens
and
this
is
my
first
taste
of
a
doppelbock
pours
a
dark
brown
with
hints
of
red
with
a
nice
head
that
slowly
settles
aroma
of
cloves
is
evident
the
first
sip
gives
you
that
hint
of
chocolate
and
spices
great
mouth
feel
and
finishes
cleanly
an
exceptional
weizen
me
likey
the
cloudy
amber
beer
with
a
wonderful
thick
head
its
purdy
and
the
aroma
is
awesome
a
fruity
spicy
aroma
mixed
in
the
texture
of
hops
and
malt
with
a
hint
of
ginger
the
smooth
fruity
tang
livens
up
the
front
of
my
tongue
there
is
a
cranberry
type
feel
amongst
the
array
of
hop
malt
and
fruit
the
spices
of
ginger
and
cinnamon
are
evident
to
me
in
this
wonderful
beer
a
great
brew
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
notes
another
remarkable
offering
from
schneider
sohn
the
high
alcohol
content
gives
an
extra
dimension
than
many
wheats
that
said
the
alcohol
really
comes
to
the
forefront
as
it
warms
this
is
a
delicious
boozy
brew
but
enjoying
for
a
session
might
land
unexpected
results
the
beer
pours
a
nebulous
mahogany
with
orange
highlights
the
head
is
preposterous
in
size
the
structure
frothy
the
color
a
medium
tan
nose
has
a
bit
or
hint
of
the
wheat
grain
mostly
sweet
malt
quite
pleasing
to
the
senses
start
is
ambrosial
nice
malted
grain
profile
with
the
top
middling
in
feel
finish
has
a
crisp
acidic
bite
the
hops
subdued
the
aftertaste
dry
and
long
lasting
a
quite
nice
beer
as
i
have
always
been
partial
to
the
bock
substyle
drinkability
this
is
amazing
i
could
chug
this
savor
this
cherish
this
and
love
this
solid
mouthfeel
i
like
it
malt
and
fruit
components
up
front
light
chocolate
blended
with
yeast
on
the
finish
very
smooth
very
drinkable
and
at
8
very
potent
really
looks
like
a
very
good
wheat
but
the
color
of
a
brown
ale
a
little
lighter
than
a
brown
but
not
much
looks
like
theres
a
storm
inside
the
beer
and
the
thick
seafoam
head
continues
to
grow
long
after
being
poured
smells
like
cherries
and
berries
fantastic
taste
very
complex
can
taste
some
fruits
and
wheat
and
it
has
the
clean
refreshing
finish
of
a
wheat
this
a
great
wheat
bock
beer
impressive
compacted
head
that
stays
throughout
and
a
malty
ultra
smooth
flavor
with
nice
yeasty
tones
overall
hints
of
caramel
and
clove
as
it
warms
with
a
very
slight
sourness
the
8
abv
is
obscured
by
its
full
body
and
flavor
another
very
impressive
beer
from

my
bottle
german

but
this
must
be
the
same
thing
same
abv
too
theoretically
i
might
encounter
a
better
weizen
than
this
one
but
i
doubt
very
much
that
will
ever
happen

dry
aftertaste
this
is
a
thoroughly
well
made
beer
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
special
german
drinking
glass
and
watched
the
enourmous
delicious
head
foam
up
after
a
minute
or
two
the
head
dissapated
and
revealed
a
dark
brown
beer
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
pretty
strong
like
a
super
hefe
weissen
it
goes
down
smooth
and
with
an
8
alcohol
content
gives
a
decent
kick
i
recommend
this
beer
for
anyone
who
enjoys
hefe
weissens
or
anyone
who
wants
to
enjoy
a
fine
german
beer
however
the
average
corona
drinker
probably
wouldnt
appreciate
it
pours
a
dark
caramel
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
the
head
retention
is
tremendous
as
it
lasts
seemingly
forever
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
bananas
clove
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
sweet
and
crisp
all
at
once
a
great
roasted
taste
is
combined
with
a
fruity
bready
yeasty
component
all
well
balanced
a
touch
of
bitterness
is
in
the
finish
along
with
the
characteristic
wheat
crispness
the
aftertaste
brings
to
mind
chocolate
covered
bananas
with
just
a
hint
of
cloves
the
mouthful
is
creamy
feeling
sinful
on
the
tongue
i
think
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
i
bought
this
particular
bottle
in
november
to
celebrate
a
pending
job
so
i
thought
i
cracked
it
open
tonight
to
celebrate
a
different
job
that
was
just
finalized
although
i
was
expecting
great
things
from
this
beer
it
still
surprised
me
a
must
buy
for
any
wheat
beer
lover
this
poured
a
brownish
red
with
a
small
slightly
tan
head
that
managed
to
remain
pretty
well
despite
the
fact
that
i
did
not
give
it
much
of
a
vigorous
pour
ill
just
have
to
try
it
again
and
pour
with
more
energy
the
smell
was
dominantly
fruity
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
yeast
i
picked
out
apples
and
raisons
with
a
bit
of
caramel
it
actually
smelled
a
bit
like
a
caramel
apple
to
me
very
pleasant
the
taste
was
equally
as
pleasant
sweet
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
fruit
while
also
spicy
and
yeasty
very
complex
smooth
and
tasty
medium
carbonation
and
body
combine
for
a
very
good
mouth
feel
and
smooth
drinkabilty
i
never
got
a
sense
of
the
8abv
overall
a
wonderful
brew
and
my
first
venture
into
the
world
of
wheat
ales
or
doppelbocks
but
it
will
definitely
not
be
my
last
the
nose
is
very
strong
and
you
can
pick
up
on
the
hops
fruit
notes
apples
and
raisons
as
well
has
the
the
great
yeast
that
goes
into
this
brew
i
had
never
had
a
doppelbock
and
i
dont
think
this
one
was
the
best
place
to
start
beings
as
it
was
dominated
by
its
yeast
still
this
is
a
great
beer
a
ton
of
complexity
here
and
also
a
very
smooth
brew
i
compared
it
to
rare
vos
ommegang
to
my
friends
but
pointed
out
that
it
managaes
to
be
even
more
drinkable
and
smooth
even
with
its
greater
alcohol
content
great
beer
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
off
white
very
dense
head
the
aromas
of
light
wheat
and
faint
fruit
delight
the
senses
in
a
subtle
way
the
first
swallow
reveals
a
hopcarb
bite
that
opens
your
eyes
in
sheer
surprise
the
flavors
of
wheat
smooth
malts
cloves
and
light
spices
start
revealing
themselves
about
midway
through
each
swallow
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
such
an
array
of
flavors
but
it
does
not
take
much
away
from
such
a
wellbalanced
complex
brew
very
nice

another
great
offering
from
herr
schneider
and
son
good
looking
cloudy
dark
peach
color
with
a
decent
head
and
great
lacing
i
really
sense
cloves
in
the
wheat
beers
from
this
brewer
and
i
like
what
im
tasting
somehow
what
doesnt
sound
that
good
to
me
does
taste
good
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
astringent
and
there
is
too
much
aftertaste
to
rate
it
5s
but
this
is
good
stuff
nonetheless
the
classic
example
of
the
weizenbock
style
enough
said
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
color
with
plum
colored
highlights
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
bubbles
the
massive
fluffy
offwhite
head
presented
itself
immediately
upon
pouring
the
froth
died
down
incredibly
slow
leaving
a
beautiful
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
very
complex
there
are
so
many
things
going
on
here
every
time
i
took
a
whiff
i
smelled
something
different
bananas
cloves
alcohol
raisins
chocolate
and
just
a
hint
of
nutmeg
the
flavor
knocked
me
off
my
feet
it
matched
the
aroma
perfectly
initial
taste
was
of
sweet
fruit
followed
by
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
then
the
alcohol
and
if
that
wasnt
enough
there
was
a
spicy
zing
of
cloves
at
the
finish
the
only
mouthfeel
complaint
that
i
have
is
that
there
was
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
it
think
it
distracted
me
a
little
from
tasting
all
the
flavors
that
that
this
beer
contained
this
is
one
of
the
best
dopplebocks
that
ive
had
and
its
very
reasonably
priced
had
a
moderate
to
short
finish
with
a
subdued
cream
in
the
finish
very
quiet
hops
and
sour
were
in
the
aftertaste
and
lingered
with
welcome
on
the
appropriate
buds
this
beer
is
so
unobtrusive
yet
still
so
hearty
in
both
taste
and
aftertaste
there
was
some
tingle
on
the
tongue
that
helped
to
call
me
back
and
the
mouthfeel
was
sort
of
wateryoily
and
from
these
notes
and
everything
else
with
it
this
beer
is
so
very
drinkable
compared
to
the
other
classic
dopplebock
celebrator
more
fruity
and
spicy
and
classic
in
its
own
right
this
wheatdoppelbock
poured
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
lot
of
light
tan
foam
the
smell
was
very
fruity
bananas
which
surprised
me
for
a
doppelbock
but
i
suppose
the
wheat
is
responsible
for
these
esters
the
taste
was
also
dominated
by
the
fruity
banana
oils
but
caramel
malt
yeast
and
a
trace
of
musty
grape
flavor
came
through
the
mouthfeel
was
sweet
and
fruity
with
medium
carbonation
and
medium
body
this
bock
was
very
drinkable
i
guess
i
am
a
sucker
for
fruity
esters
a
great
brew
pours

this
is
a

beer
definitely
warming
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
but
great
once
in
a
while
the
kind
of
beer
that
makes
you
say
hmmm
after
every
sip
thats
not
a
bad
thing
but
as
the
beer
sat
the
head
expanded
it
didnt
bubble
down
to
a
thin
layer
with
the
hints
of
clove
it
is
medium

way
too
sweet

like
for

but
fits
the

hops
are
a
bit
too
muted
up

then
too
spicy
and
strong
on
the
back
end
like
they
didnt
blend
in

but
cant

a

it
4
pours

the

theres

im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheats
or
dopplebocks
but
this
is
really
really
good
a
very
nice
collaboration
a
good
beer
and
one
that
benefited
from
the
extra
hops
in
both
the
taste
and
smell
whilst
it
was
a
pleasant
beer
i
think
id
be
put
off
buying
it
all
that
often
based
on
the
fact
that
it
is
a
lot
stronger
and
harder
to
get
a
hold
of
that
several
other
german
wheat
beer
really
delicious
and
refreshing
an
excellent
brew
outstanding
beer
lots
of
complimenting
flavours
and
easy
to
drink
a
winner
o
an
interesting
beer
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
or
would
really
look
out
for
but
it
was
interesting
i
dont
really
think
it
ranks
as
high
as
everyone
says
it
does
but
one
can
tell
it
is
definitely
a
product
that
was
well
invested
in
and
brewed
integrity
this
beer
was
a
strange
cross
between
an
american
ale
and
a
german
weisse
reminded
me
of
a
dream
i
had
once
about
ryan
seacrest

not
a
bad
beer
o
second
time
having
this
the
first
time
years
ago
when
it
came
out
i
hate
to
admit
i
may
have
drunk
straight
from
the
bottle
while
liquored
up
one
night
mildly
astonished
just
how
flavorful
and
enjoyable
this
beer
is
this
bottle
was
only
a
couple
months
old
kinda
curious
how
some
of
the
older
bottles
i
have
compare
this
is
a
wonderful
hoppy
alternative
to
your
ubiquitous
ipas
a
perfect
summer
beer
its
a
perfect
balance
between
a
weissen
and
an
ipa
you
have
the
mouthfeel
the
cloudyness
and
the
yeast
taste
from
a
schneider
and
you
add
hop
if
youre
a
hop
head
and
you
want
something
crist
clear
clean
and
tasty
thats
the
beer
you
want
to
try
d
very
very
good
beer
that
i
can
drink
in
large
quantities
taste
never
gets
old
o
a
little
too
much
sweet
malt
especially
when
compared
with
what
i
expected
based
on
the
aromas
its
a
solid
concept
but
to
my
taste
a
little
more
hops
balance
would
have
made
it
even
better
the
hops
added
fruitiness
but
not
much
bitterness
im
not
saying
they
should
hop
it
up
to
dipa
levels
just
a
bit
more
still
its
an
enjoyable
foray
into
a
hybrid
style
notes
this
is
very
good
this
is
interesting
but
not
something
id
buy
again
o
a
very
complex
beer
that
almost
leaves
you
lost
for
words
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
would
be
the
goldenchild
of
a
hefe
and
ipa
sweet
yet
sour
fruity
yet
bitter
this
is
a
beer
which
should
be
experienced
for
those
who
love
beers
which
bend
boundaries
it
is
by
far
the
most
experimental
german
beer
ive
encountered
and
it
does
it
well
this
is
a
fantastically
unusual
and
wellbrewed
beer
experimentation
like
and
exceptional
collaboration
such
as
displayed
in
this
beer
are
what
drive
the
craft
pour
is
hazed
deep
amber
with
a
good
bit
of
tight
white
head
that
lingers
for
quite
some
time
nose
is
an
interesting
mix
of
sweet
spicy
and
tangy
yeast
lots
of
bubblegum
lemon
clove
and
pepper
its
very
different
loads
of
bubblegum
mix
with
the
tangy
yeast
and
pepper
in
back
taste
is
much
of
the
same
huge
bubblegum
up
front
lots
of
sweetness
with
the
yeast
characteristics
coming
in
at
the
back
more
tangy
with
hints
of
pepper
lighter
body
moderate
carbonation
and
some
lingering
citrus
hops
through
the
finish
rather
hard
to
get
around
here
o
a
topnotch
weizenbock
sees
a
generous
hopping
on
paper
it
sounds
like
a
forced
combination
but
this
actually
fits
together
very
nicely
the
spicy
herbal
dimension
points
to
noble
hops
but
the
lavender
has
to
be
saphir
i
can
see
this
pairing
very
nicely
with
some
sort
of
curry
overall
not
top
familiar
with
this
style
but
this
beer
is
very
delicious
obtained
bottle
from
willow
park
liquor
store
in
calgary
pours
a
dark
peach
amber
color
with
ample
white
head
aroma
sweet
and
spicy
reminiscent
of
baked
apple
banana
bread
pineapple
juice
caramel
honey
and
sharp
spice
almost
like
caraway
when
one
factors
in
the
bread
and
yeast
smells
like
a
hefeweizen
with
added
fruit
and
spice
flavor
is
complex
and
includes
the
expected
banana
and
clove
elements
but
also
darker
sweeter
malts
this
beer
is
dryhopped
with
german
designer
hop
saphir
which
adds
strawberry
sweet
fruity
notes
to
the
classic
german
wheat
yeasty
esters
malty
and
fruity
with
strawberry
and
raspberry
notes
blending
with
raisin
and
date
flavors
from
the
dark
malts
loads
of
unripe
pineapple
that
builds
over
time
fairly
heavy
sweet
palate
gives
way
to
bitter
hops
and
green
fruit
in
the
finish
the
total
package
works
maybe
sweeter
than
advertised
more
of
a
weizenbock
with
unique
hop
elements
than
a
true
fusion
of
styles
o
excellent
drinkability
if
there
was
a
style
such
as
german
double
ipa
with
excellent
yeast
esters
expected
more
hop
presence
fairly
sweet

i
believed
they
used
saphir
hops
in
this
brew
it
goes
without

paired

foster
the
tartness
def
played
well
with
this
tarty
lemony
wheat
flavour
that
seems
to
envelop
your
tongue
this
then
leads
to
a
slight
hop
bitterness
that
to
me
just
seems
a
little
out
of
place
it
seems
that
if
the
hops
were
a
little
more
piney
or
citrus
it
would
meld
really
well
too
the
taste
is
lemony
and
citrusy
and
oh
so
refeshing
the
hop
profile
is
understated
yet
its
earthy
and
floral
influence
is
everywhere
i
let
this
chill
longer
than
usual
and
didnt
wait
for
it
to
warm
initially
white
head
into
a
chalice
the
appearance
was
just
what
i
expected
of
a
true
hefeweizen
the
aroma
was
of
banana
and
cloves
the
classic
weizen
yeast
profile
heavenly
the
taste
was
a
delicate
blend
of
banana
and
clove
esters
with
an
understated
and
im
excited
that
they
are
working
together
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
brooklyn
version
bkilpatrmay

hints
of
pine

the
taste
very
tangy
it
is
perhaps
the
most

i
have

is

this

the

a

right
away
then
is

by
some

the
taste

as
was
its

never

feels
fairly
traditional
in
that

is
good

hits
you

theres
a
lovely
fruity
explosion
of
esters
right
at
the
front
nelson
sauvin
hops
come
through
nicely
at
the
end
a
delicate
flavor
o
excellent
for
style
great
aroma
but
this
did
not
quite
fork
for
me
i
missed
the
swet
spiciness
of
a
weisse
miles
behind
tap
6
for
me
this
was
a
perfect
beer
for
me
after
aging
three
years
this
was
a
marvellously
smooth
tasty
and
rounded
beer
some
of
my
favorite
beers
are
from
schneider
and
this
was
far
surpassed
the
expectations
that
i
had
a
very
interesting
idea
here
a
german
wheat
lager
with
nelson
hops
has
to
be
great
right
well
it
is
great
but
the
bottle
i
shared
was
dated
2012
and
i
have
to
wonder
if
the
one
of
a
kind
character
of
the
nelson
hops
has
tailed
off
a
little
bit
over
time
it
sure
seems
that
way
not
to
say
the
haze
beige
bronze
colored
heady
beer
isnt
hoppy
because
it
is
but
that
tropical
nelson
character
is
pretty
minimal
lost
in
a
denser
bodied
strong
wheat
base
the
bitterness
is
there
and
so
is
a
light
lemony
fruity
element
but
i
couldnt
not
place
it
as
nelson
which
is
concerning
to
me
because
i
think
its
the
most
unmistakable
hop
varietal
out
there
love
the
creamy
feel
the
snappy
finish
and
the
luxurious
nature
of
the
beer
prickly
little
bubbles
lift
up
the
malt
and
the
hops
really
do
bring
it
alll
together
in
the
finish
its
great
beer
a
new
direction
for
the
germans
for
sure
but
i
would
love
to
compare
this
to
a
fresh
bottle
and
see
how
it
has
changed
over
time
still
awesome
stuff
though
just
not
the
nelson
bomb
i
had
anticipated
taste
seems
to
have
a
slight
oxidation
present
papery
notes
to
the
wheat
some
mild
nebulous
stonefruit
and
a
dry
finish
full
bodied
and
fairly
big
in
the
abc
department
overall
it
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
not
sure
the
age
of
the
keg
but
it
didnt
really
seem
hoppy
or
unique

o
as

ive
had
plenty
of
german

beers
that
were

this
one
takes
the
cake
im
going
to
go
buy
another
bottle
for
the
cellar
right
now
actually
definitely
in
contention
for
favorite
weiss
enjoy
later
edit
just
had
the
2011
vintage
and
the
fruitiness
is
off
the
charts
huge
orchard
fruit
and
exotic
lytchee
the
rest
are
the
same
but
the
hops
hugely
enhanced
the
fruity
character
this
is
extremely
tasty

real

into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
im
not
sure
it
warrants
the
17
99
price
tag
for
a
big
bottle
but
it
was
tasty
a
very
subtle
beer
with
just
enough
champagne
essence
to
make
it
lighthearted
but
with
enough
beer
muscle
to
keep
up
the
attitude
and
get
the
job
done
before
it
strides
off
perfectly
into
the
distance
making
you
reflect
on
its
genius
a
really
delicious
beer
the
hops
provide
a
full
delicious
taste
ontop
of
the
really
solid
malt
base
not
as
tropical
punch
as
ns
can
be
this
had
more
soft
kiwi
lychee
pineapple
and
a
slight
tart
aspect
balance
is
perfect
and
it
drinks
very
well
a
tasty
and
complex
beer
that
drinks
much
lighter
than
the
abv
would
make
an
ideal
summer
beer
i
would
tone
down
the
carbonation
but
otherwise
enjoyed
this
balance
is
quite
good
and
the
tartness
works
well
with
the
wheat
another
winner
from
this
brewery
overall
a
very
fine
beer
worth
trying
a
couple
of
times
because
well
it
was
new
and
i
hadnt
seen
it
anywhere
in
the
future
would
probably
buy
other
beers
before
this
one
especially
since
i
enjoy
the
weihenstepahner
vitus
and
the
schneiderweisse
aventinus
tap
6
to
all
be
in
a
similar
vein
nonethless
a
very
enjoyable
beer
o
an
extremely
tasty
and
beautiful
beer
o
a
tasty
brew
that
i
suspect
has
mellowed
with
nearly
2
years
of
aging
delicate
flavours
and
super
easy
sipping
a
great
treat
on
a
hot
summer
eve
overall
nice
stuff
but
not
as
nice
as
the
vitus
i
had
recently
o
very
good
beer
lots
of
tropical
fruits
nice
and
light
very
easy
drinking
beer
worth
a
try
even
if
its
not
your
favorite
style
im
not
sure
what
i
expected
but
i
was
pretty
happy
with
what
i
ended
up
with
well
worth
a
try
even
if
its
not
your
favorite
style
overall
not
sure
if
this
beer
is
a
little
past
its
prime
but
its
still
very
good
not
something
that
stands
out
to
me
as
something
i
need
to
buy
again
though
happy
to
have
tried
a
rather
good
weizenbock
my
only
real
beef
here
is
with
the
sort
of
indistinct
nature
of
the
heralded
guest
hops
theyre
there
sure
but
not
in
any
measure
that
i
might
not
have
mistaken
them
for
a
touch
of
plain
ol
cascade
the
wine
character
just
doesnt
permeate
leaving
me
with
a
kind
of
opportunity
loss
cost
feeling
good
but
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
perhaps
thats
the
german
reservedness
asserting
itself
here
o
a
nice
beer
and
always
good
to
bad
a
rarity
i
really
think
this
beer
has
probably
mellowed
significantly
in
the
the
nearly
2
years
since
it
was
bottled
day
214
of
2011
i
would
love
to
lay
a
bottle
of
this
down
for
5
more
years
to
see
how
it
evolves
i
just
might
if
i
can
muster
the
willpower
o
elegant
and
worth
a
try
but
pricey
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
hazy
medium
golden
amber
with
a
fine
three
finger
white
head
with
great
retention
that
leaves
pillowy
lacing
classic
weizen
aroma
of
sweet
wheat
bananas
anc
cloves
no
evidence
of
the
nelson
hopping
flavor
follows
aroma
with
sweet
wheat
light
banana
and
clove
interesting
light
sweet
fruit
flavor
which
i
assume
is
from
the
the
hops
vaguely
reminiscent
of
a
sweet
white
wine
although
i
would
not
have
identified
it
as
such
if
i
had
not
read
the
bottle
label
finishes
moderately
dry
with
light
fruity
hops
light
bodied
but
nice
mouth
feel
from
carbonation
a
nice
variant
on
a
well
made
weizenbock
flavors
were
well
integrated
a
bit
subdued
another
great
beer
from
this
very
consistantly
good
brewery
i
hope
schneider
weisse
change
this
to
a
year
round
edition
really
nice
beer
the
flavor
is
great
as
the
mouthfeel
with
subtle
floral
hop
entry
andn
caramel
as
indicated
from
the
malt
in
the
nose
with
subtle
tropical
taste
from
the
yeast
and
nelson
hops
with
slight
white
grape
tanginess
and
mild
alcohol
backing
the
mix
of
spice
in
the
yeast
and
gentle
banana
with
a
goody
amount
of
hop
flavor
considering
the
age
of
this
bottle
overall
i
was
highly
impressed
a
very
good
weizenbock
which
i
think
fits
the
style
well
withh
a
nice
taste
from
the
nelson
sauvin
hop
varietal
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
and
well
worth
the
price
in
my
opinion
o
a
rare
sight
in
these
parts
it
wasnt
cheap
but
no
regrets
here
very
nice

on
a
hazy
light

body
clear
and
soapy
lacing
sticks
to
the

aroma
includes
sweet
bananas
a
delicious
yeastiness
and
maybe
some
caramel
and
some
clove
and
white
pepper
taste
follows
suit
with
banana
dominating
drank
it
fresh
and
now
a
year
old
more
earthy
and
slightly
sweeter
today
but
i
would
say
this
would
be
interesting
to
evaluate
as
it
gets
even
older
delicious
period
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
midlevel
carbonation
leading
to
a
mouthfeel
that
foams
up
slightly
across
the
palate
but
is
still
quite
enjoyable
closes
dry
with
modest
residual
stickiness
across
the
palate
drinkability
schneider
makes
great
hefeweizens
and
weizenbocks
this
is
another
overall
very
good
for
a
weisse
with
a
fantastic
nose
but
gets
tiring
as
the
style
usually
does
for
me
overall
this
is
good
stuff
even
with
a
year
or
so
of
age
on
it
they
say
can
be
cellared
for
later
enjoyment
on
the
bottle
but
my
guess
is
that
its
not
getting
any
better
than
it
is
now
my
suggestion
drink
it
now
and
if
they
happen
to
release
it
again
drink
it
as
fresh
as
you
can
get
it
d
very
drinkable
nice
weizenbock
with
a
little
extra
hops
good
overall
balance
and
hop
profile
o
very
easy
to
drink
considering
how
big
this
beer
is
and
especially
compared
to
others
in
the
style
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
very
enjoyable
flavor
and
it
highlights
the
use
of
one
of
my
favorite
hops
an
exceptional
weizenbock
seems
a
few
german
brewers
are
looking
to
break
out
of
their
rigid
ways
without
rocking
the
purity
boat
too
much
what
better
way
than
to
use
a
hop
that
will
somewhat
radically
bring
a
new
flavor
to
your
beer
without
compromising
kudos
on
the
leap
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
not
terribly
intriguing
but
still
very
goodtasting
schneider
oneoffs
are
always
something
worth
trying
this
is
no
exception
this
hop
varietal
has
been
getting
alot
of
play
recently
not
always
successfully
it
works
well
with
the
style
and
plays
nice
with
your
standard
wheat
beer
characteristics

a

on

after
purchasing
from
the
queens
quay
lcbo
outlet
in

ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
medium

colour
with
a
thin

the
aroma
was
wheat
malt
banana
clove
and
undefinable
spices
the
mouthfeel

great

here
finished
the
750ml
with
no
problems
different
take
on
the
style
and
enjoyable
all
around
o
a
yummy
wiezenbock
well
worth
taking
for
a
spin
super
stoked
that
the
lcbo
brought
this
one
in
fantastic
ale
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
i
really
didnt
see
how
this
beer
would
be
special
after
tasting
what
only
changing
a
hop
variety
can
do
its
quite
remarkable
the
difference
schneider
weisse
tap
x
mein
nelson
sauvin
is
a
wheat
beer
as
heavy
as
the
bottle
it
comes
in
its
also
as
strong
as
its
name
is
long
and
hard
to
pronounce
and
as
a
german
beer
that
showcases
new
zealand
hops
brewed
for
a
dutch
cafe
is
every
bit
as
distinctive
as
it
sounds
that
said
i
didnt
enjoy
it
terribly
and
will
think
twice
about
buying
it
again
the
earlier
collaboration
with
brooklyn
was
for
my
tastes
a
much
better
offering
unique
beer
from
start
to
the
end
it
is
even
sold
in
a
nice
but
uncommon
0
75l
bottle
rather
a
prosecco
bottle
not
necessary
100
my
taste
but
better
than
most
other
wheats
thumbs
up
overall
drinkability
too
expensive
to
get
often
but
quite
interesting
to
try
out
i
suspect
that
the
grape
fruitiness
im
tasting
is
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
but
i
dont
know
that
for
sure
a
bit
more
flavorful
than
other
weizenbocks
ive
had
but
i
suspect
part
of
that
is
due
to
the
fact
that
i
did
not
get
all
the
yeast
sediment
into
the
glass
ive
found
far
more
often
than
not
that
if
too
much
of
the
sediment
comes
into
the
glass
everything
gets
muddled
and
dominated
by
the
yeast
in
this
case
the
yeast
was
pretty
well
caked
onto
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
had
to
really
shake
it
when
rinsing
it
out
so
i
think
the
fact
that
the
yeast
didnt
come
along
in
the
pour
really
helped
me
taste
this
beer
and
the
unique
hops
put
into
it
so
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
wishing
i
had
more
right
now
and
quite
interesting
but
due
to
the
cost
its
more
of
a
special
occasion
beer
the
special
hops
really
do
come
through
but
i
think
only
because
most
of
the
yeast
stayed
behind
had
the
yeast
come
through
i
think
i
would
have
missed
all
the
aroma
and
flavor
like
some
of
the
other
reviews
suggest
therefore
i
can
say
that
this
is
a
good
beer
not
amazing
but
definitely
good
if
you
leave
the
yeast
sediment
behind
another
highly
drinkable
weisbier
from
schneider
though
it
didnt
wow
me
with
its
aroma
or
flavor
i
think
its
wellcrafted
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
nelson
sauvin
hops
arent
more
apparent
especially
considering
the
beers
namesake
prost
had
high
hopes
for
this
after
the
nose
but
the
flavour
profile
falls
a
bit
flat
and
the
nelson
struggles
to
get
a
guernsey
decent
wheat
beer
but
the
nelson
just
doesnt
come
through
much
prefer
the
brashness
of
the
schneider
hopfenweisse
in
light
of
this
this
beer
is
pretty
poor
value
youre
paying
a
big
premium
for
something
which
tastes
just
like
schneiders
other
wheat
beers
this
is
an
exceptionally
refined
and
well
crafted
beer
the
combination
of
hop
and
hefeweizen
is
well
executed
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
recently
picked
this
up
at
my
favorite
beer
store
in
belgium
dranken
geers
beautiful
golden
yellow
not
quite
orange
cloudy
pour
with
a
huge
three
finger
snow
white
head
with
great
retention
and
crazy
lacing
the
nose
is
typical
weizen
with
lots
of
clove
banana
and
pineapple
but
for
me
the
nelson
sauvin
made
it
stand
apart
in
a
subtle
and
pleasant
way
the
hops
are
definitely
there
but
not
as
inyourface
as
ive
experienced
in
the
past
with
other
styles
brewed
with
nelson
sauvin
the
same
is
true
in
the
taste
with
the
standard
hints
of
clove
and
banana
but
theres
more
of
a
fruity
flowery
and
subtle
vinous
tinge
to
this
beer
i
have
to
believe
its
the
nelson
sauvin
that
make
this
so
unique
ive
lived
in
germany
for
11
years
and
never
been
a
weizen
fan
but
this
beer
is
so
much
different
than
the
typical
german
weizen
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
slightly
dry
refreshing
finish
still
not
a
weizen
fan
but
i
would
definitely
revisit
this
beer
if
the
price
tag
would
come
down
a
bit
this
is
a
medium
bodied
feel
and
moderately
carbonated
a
bit
more
hoppiness
than
expected
in
this
style
but
thats
what
this
beer
is
all
about
the
alcohol
warmth
is
perfectly
integrated
making
this
an
all
around
perfectly
balanced
weizenbier
this
is
a
must
try
for
wheat
beer
lovers
im
not
sold
on
the
weizenbock
classification
here
sure
it
is
of
bock
strength
but
it
is
very
pale
in
color
and
if
not
for
the
increased
abv
it
is
very
much
a
hefeweizen
regardless
i
am
sold
on
this
brew
and
would
love
to
have
it
again
i
hope
this
id
a
start
for
new
things
to
come
from
schneider
well
done
overall
im
kinda
disappointed
i
like
regular
schneider
weisse
better
hefeweizen
weizenbock
who
cares
this
is
delightful
is
it
20
delightful
thats
pushing
it
overall
pretty
good
beer
definantly
not
worth
the
15
unfiltered
golden
orangebrown
brilliant
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
and
good
retention
nose
is
fruity
with
lots
of
tropical
notes
a
generous
amount
of
wheat
and
lesser
spicing
is
there
sweet
and
certainly
inviting
taste
has
some
dry
wheaty
flavours
and
the
lovely
juicy
tropical
fruitiness
is
revisited
mango
passionfruit
and
some
nectarine
pits
stick
out
sweeter
in
the
finish
with
some
spice
character
i
can
draw
alot
of
parallels
between
this
and
the
schneiderbrooklyner
weizenbock
full
bodied
with
no
alcohol
and
really
smooth
incredibly
drinkable
in
terms
of
flavour
but
not
in
price
tag
based
on
what
steve
told
me
he
paid
for
this
just
way
too
expensive
to
revisit
again
for
what
it
is
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
with
the
hops
adding
something
to
the
mix
im
not
sure
id
put
it
up
there
with
the
best
in
the
style
as
it
doesnt
come
together
completely
for
me
b
cheers
not
a
whole
lot
different
or
better
from
other
schneider
weisse
beers
of
similar
color
like
the
original
or
the
blonde
or
even
hopfenweiss
but
certainly
worth
a
try
perfectly
enjoyable
if
not
tremendously
interesting
pours
a
very
hazy
apricot
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
creamy
head
that
stays
and
leaves
nice
lacingthe
smell
is
banannascandied
wheat
and
floral
hopsthe
mouthfeel
is
smoothmedium
bodied
and
creamy
and
has
tastes
of
freshly
cut
banannas
with
sugar
on
topa
touch
of
lycheecandied
wheatfigs
and
finished
with
a
floral
hoppy
finish
and
overall
a
very
nice
tasty
brew
that
i
would
drink
again
cheers
o
this
is
a
nice
weizenbock
but
i
dont
really
see
how
it
is
all
that
different
from
schneiders
other
products
i
know
that
they
are
using
nelson
sauvin
hops
in
this
beer
but
in
all
honesty
the
tropical
fruit
flavors
of
the
hops
are
pretty
subdued
so
i
guess
i
dont
really
understand
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
that
being
said
this
is
still
an
enjoyable
weizenbock
its
just
not
great
o
nelson
sauvin
hop
adds
a
nice
flavor
differing
from
other
weizenbocks
o
intense
balance
and
enjoyably
smooth
and
delicious
a
low
profile
carbonation
helps
mouthfeel
and
allows
the
flavors
to
pop
overall
a
very
good
allround
beer
this
isnt
a
true
weizenbock
as
others
have
said
but
the
innovation
shown
here
is
quite
interesting
a
hefeweizen
with
a
little
bit
more
to
it
well
worth
a
go
nice
sized
fluffy
head
with
streaks
of
lace
all
the
way
down
amber
color
with
moderate
carbonation
smell
has
lots
of
clove
and
mild
banana
sweet
alcohol
flexes
itself
taste
is
also
sweet
with
booze
wheat
malt
and
bananas
spicy
clove
and
cinnamon
with
a
peppery
edge
hops
are
well
integrated
and
bloom
as
it
warms
giving
a
touch
more
bite
feel
is
light
with
mild
carbonation
that
gives
way
to
a
thin
smooth
creaminess
not
a
bad
beer
and
quite
drinkable
but
at
20
bucks
a
bottle
a
bit
too
pricey
for
me
to
think
about
another
single
finger
head
on
a
dark
cloudy
golden
amber
body
decent
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
dark
fruit
and
fig
fairly
sweet
the
flavor
is
more
subdued
and
mostly
cantaloupe
and
dark
red
fruits
musty
as
well
medium
body
and
light
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
however
not
as
similar
in
the
flavor
as
in
the
aroma
as
many
other
belgian
dark
strongs
d
sweet
and
vinous
it
doesnt
quite
become
cloying
but
it
comes
close
my
first
nelson
sauvin
beer
and
im
really
not
that
impressed
schneider
tap
x
mein
nelson
sauvin
pours
a
mildly
cloudy
orange
with
some
goldenrod
highlights
theres
about
three
fingers
of
fluffy
white
foam
the
head
shows
some
staying
power
but
to
say
that
lacing
is
just
spotty
would
be
being
kind
the
nose
is
very
nice
there
are
some
phenolic
clove
notes
that
play
against
an
absolute
ton
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
aromas
somewhere
in
that
menagerie
is
some
banana
as
well
the
flavor
starts
out
nicely
with
a
little
bit
of
bready
sweetness
fading
into
some
clove
notes
the
hops
on
the
back
end
are
a
little
out
of
whack
though
as
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
too
pronounced
compared
to
the
somewhat
lackluster
citrusfruity
finish
that
doesnt
live
up
to
the
nose
on
this
beer
the
body
is
fine
medium
bodied
and
solid
but
the
carbonation
just
falls
a
bit
dull
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
schneiderbrooklyn
hopfen
weisse
so
i
was
very
much
looking
forward
to
another
hoppy
weisse
from
schneider
but
this
one
just
doesnt
measure
up
too
me
this
is
not
more
than
a
rather
bland
high
alcohol
wheat
beer
d
the
nelson
sauvin
contribution
is
fairly
restrained
but
this
is
a
nice
weizenbock
with
a
complementary
belgian
yeast
presence
mixed
in
probably
not
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
i
think
it
was
nearly
20
for
a
750ml
bottle
but
its
refreshing
to
see
german
breweries
stepping
a
bit
outside
their
comfort
zone
if
i
saw
this
ontap
id
probably
order
a
glass
very
easy
to
drink
the
bottle
went
pretty
quickly
at
our
table
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
weizen
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
color
with
a
couple
inch
frothy
white
head
the
head
stays
around
a
while
and
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
cloves
wheat
bananas
and
some
white
grapes
and
bubblegum
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
a
slight
sour
citrus
lemon
peelorange
flavor
also
noticeable
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
has
moderatehigh
carbonation
i
think
its
a
solid
beer
overall
but
i
dont
think
it
was
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
i
think
it
was
17
99
a
bottle
if
it
was
cheaper
id
consider
buying
this
again
in
the
future
m
the
sweet
goodness
of
a
wheat
beer
with
the
added
flavor
of
nelson
sauvin
experimentation
at
its
finest
especially
from
a
german
brewer
a
good
to
very
good
beer
o
tap
x
mein
nelson
sauvin
is
a
oneofakind
beer
a
very
hoppy
hefeweizen
but
no
a
weizenbock
by
any
stretch
i
think
more
munich
malt
would
push
this
beer
into
the
exceptional
range
as
it
is
now
the
lemony
sourness
is
a
little
much
but
the
fruity
hoppiness
is
very
delicious
and
great
twist
on
this
style
overall
a
really
interesting
take
and
a
rare
example
of
stylistic
creativity
by
a
german
brewer
i
hope
we
see
more
of
that
pours
a
murky
peach
color
with
a
good
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
carries
some
tropical
hop
notes
plus
light
clove
and
german
yeast
flavor
falls
back
a
bit
more
toward
a
standard
hefe
though
the
hops
are
certainly
still
noticeable
light
body
with
a
bit
of
chewiness
pretty
good
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
weizen
im
a
sucker
for
both
hopped
wheat
beers
and
nz
hops
so
this
one
ticks
boxes
for
me
silky
smooth
and
superbly
balanced
not
quite
the
brooklyner
collaboration
but
close
works
well
with
spiced
pickled
carrots
and
cheese
the
beer
is
hazy
and
light
orange
colored
with
a
thick
white
head
that
leaves
copious
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
clove
banana
floral
notes
hops
dont
shine
through
as
much
as
i
expected
but
instead
offer
a
subtle
floral
presence
more
notably
in
the
finish
overall
a
really
pleasant
flavor
most
similar
to
a
hefeweizen
as
opposed
to
a
bock
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
not
worth
the
18
99
price
tag
poured
a
cloudy
gold
with
good

i
am
picking
up

well
as
peppery

also
some

i

be
from

a

i

it

will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
o
an
excellent
weizenbock
normally
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
type
but
after
tasting
this
one
i
am
sure
i
will
come
back
to
have
another
try
full
bodied
with
an
excellent
balance
of
zesty
spice
bready
yeast
banana
notes
and
sweet
citrus
really
nice
zesty
clove
presence
up
front
that
lingers
throughout
but
doesnt
dominate
letting
the
other
flavors
shine
prominent
bready
yeast
flavor
adds
complexity
and
fullness
to
the
palate
creating
a
somewhat
creamy
texture
lots
of
citrus
sweetness
along
with
banana
tons
of
orange
and
lemon
zest
which
complmnets
the
clove
full
bodied
flavorful
and
extremely
quaffable
the
aroma
is
kind
of
weak
but
this
beer
packs
a
ton
of
flavor
overall
i
hardly
ever
score
overall
higher
than
taste
but
something
drew
me
to
this
beer
i
liked
the
beer
as
a
whole
better
than
the
taste
it
doesnt
make
sense
to
me
either
an
excellent
beer
no
doubt
though
im
not
really
sure
the
added
hops
really
provide
all
that
much
additional
flavor
in
other
words
this
would
be
a
pretty
excellent
weizen
bock
all
on
its
own
imho
regardless
this
is
another
very
well
made
beer
from
the
excellent
brewers
at
schneider
overall
a
very
nice
beer
from
schneider
that
reinforces
just
how
much
i
like
nelson
sauvin
hops
overall
i
love
the
bouncing
between
orange
and
banana
and
the
play
between
bitter
and
sweet
on
this
thing
it
goes
back
and
forth
and
forth
this
is
one
unbelievably
good
beer
aroma
dark

earthiness

taste
acetic
cherries
wine
im
obviously
not
getting
this
beer
the
pinot
noir
flavor
dominates
to
the
point
that
id
rather
have
a
glass
of
the
real
thing
o
a
very
nice
array
of
flavors
and
blending
involved
to
make
this

settles
slowly
wow
the
pinot
noir
barrel
really
stands
out
but
doesnt
overwhelm
the
nosemusty
phenols
and
a
hint
of
sherry
vinegar
rounds
the
aroma
profile
out
very
low
carbonation
with
a
fuller
feelvery
mellow
pinot
noir
grapes
are
really
big
on
the
palate
along
with
oakthe
weizenbock
flavors
come
into
form
the
more
i
drinksome
spiced
phenols
and
faint
chocolate
come
alive
as
it
warms
very
interesting
and
as
others
have
said
its
good
to
see
an
old
school
traditional
german
brewer
try
things
like
this
its
a
sipper
but
its
complex
and
different
i
loved
this
one
even
at
20
for
the
750ml
d
im
excited
to
see
german
breweries
stepping
outside
their
comfort
zone
a
little
this
wasnt
mindblowing
but
it
demonstrated
solid
craftsmanship
and
the
willingness
to
experiment
i
wish
it
smelled
a
bit
more
like
it
tasted
as
the
aroma
was
a
bit
too
conservative
to
justify
the
marked
price
increase
medium
bodied
with
tart
sourness
and
a
very
strong
vinous
barrel
character
that
dominates
the
flavor
profile
lingering
over
the
malt
backbone
into
a
dry
acetic
finish
almost
all
barrel
until
the
finish
with
toasted
oak
vanilla
and
dominant
vinous
red
wine
flavor
with
dark
grape
tart
cherry
currant
and
other
dark
berries
underneath
there
is
some
faint
roasted
malt
but
its
overpowered
by
the
barrel
and
acetic
acid
as
it
warms
the
acetic
character
stands
out
a
but
more
with
strong
vinegar
in
the
finish
still
its
not
solvent
like
and
it
blends
well
with
the
tartness
and
vinous
barrel
notes
flavorful
but
kind
of
one
dimensional
with
all
elements
of
the
base
beer
completely
obliterated
i
wish
that
there
was
a
touch
of
weizenbock
flavor
but
any
cant
pick
up
anything
that
resembles
the
style
this
beer
was
putried
cold
but
got
better
as
it
warmed
it
still
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
i
wouldve
preferred
some
more
barrel
character
and
a
bit
of
sourness
to
make
all
the
flavors
shine
to
me
it
was
just
sort
of
a
weizenbock
with
some
extra
flavors
thrown
in
that
didnt
really
mesh
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
considering
its
strength
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
i
really
enjoyed
the
aromas
and
flavors
created
by
the
barrel
aging
o
very
enjoyable
but
this
is
a
sipping
beer
that
needs
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
and
is
best
shared
between
a
few
people
the
barrel
aging
really
adds
to
this
beer
and
contributes
a
lot
of
flavorsaromas
and
mouthfeel
this
is
a
strange
beer
i
cant
find
this
beer
entirely
convincing
it
is
somewhat
overly
fruity
to
my
taste
with
the
wine
notes
that
i
normally
like
being
overplayed
once
the
weizen
comes
into
it
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
base
beer
which
i
believe
is
a
take
on
aventinus
is
works
extremely
well
in
conjunction
with
the
pinot
wine
barrel
flavors
the
vinous
wine
notes
do
not
overpower
but
instead
work
seamlessly
with
the
base
weizenbock
in
a
beautiful
melange
of
sweet
malt
oak
tannins
fruit
and
spice
very
syrupy
mouthfeel
really
the
main
problem
i
have
with
it
unlike
other
weizenbocks
of
similar
strength
this
does
not
have
the
carbonation
to
carry
all
the
flavors
to
a
happy
place
just
too
sticky
a
750ml
split
between
2
would
have
been
better
split
between
3
or
4
that
said
a
worthwhile
experiment
i
want
to
love
it
and
ill
buy
another
bottle
just
to
see
what
happens
a
stunner
for
sure
on
par
with
the
illustrious
original
this
is
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
i
poured
this
from
a
growler
it
has
a
burnt
orange
color
body
with
a
2
tan
head
the
smell
has
clove
banana
aroma
to
it
the
taste
starts
off
sweet
of
banana
and
yeast
then
the
clove
comes
through
the
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
and
the
clove
after
taste
is
great
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
wish
they
bottled
it
this
year
and
hope
to
see
it
on
shelfs
in
the
future
it
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
a
delicious
beer

that
reduces
to
a

pretty
quickly
no

aromas
of

light

some

here
very
inviting
taste
of

no

on

but
there
is
some
lingering
notes
of
caramel
banana

molasses
and
spices
on
the

for
a
bit
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
very
nice

and
smooth
mouthfeel
that
drinks
easily
no
alcohol
noticed
other
than
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
and
delicious
weizenbock
at
almost
2
years
past
freshness
date
i
wonder
if
they
will
ever
bottle
it
again
great
lakes
continues
to
impress
with
their
awesome
beverages
the
glockenspiel
is
noe
exception
the
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
with
burnt
orange
highlights
no
real
head
of
which
to
speak
just
some
thin
wisps
on
top
a
small
ring
around
the
perimeter
marginal
lacing
at
best
the
smell
includes
sweet
nose
with
just
a
bit
of
tartness
light
fruit
notes
banana
apple
hints
of
clove
the
taste
exhibits
more
tartness
than
in
the
nose
almost
sour
with
banana
orange
tones
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
downgraded
due
to
the
heacy
abv
the
body
is
heavy
overall
its
drinkable
but
nothing
about
it
screams
exceptional
by
any
means
worth
a
shot
but
im
no
hurry
for
another
o
a
nice
weizen
bock
that
has
held
up
pretty
well
havent
had
it
fresh
for
comparison
but
i
would
have
this
again
lots
of
grassy
grain
like
smells
in
hear
with
a
decent
enough
amount
of
yeast
thrown
in
for
good
measure
definitly
a
very
lively
and
right
smell
this
was
sure
to
win
people
over
grain
for
that
matter
a
very
belgian
like
flavor
witha
good
amount
of
light
fruit
like
yeast
and
hints
of
pears
and
apples
mixed
in
among
the
various
grain
like
flavors
blended
very
well
with
no
trace
at
all
of
the
alcohol
inside
this
was
so
amply
carbonated
i
do
not
even
know
where
t
begin
just
a
great
light
feel
and
smooth
crisp
clean
finish
really
a
winner
here
for
sure
o
at
first
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
of
my
first
real
experiments
with
aging
but
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
very
much
the
sweetness
seems
more
under
control
now
than
it
was
when
fresh
and
there
is
a
good
mix
of
the
banana
sweet
and
dark
fruit
flavors
it
is
going
down
rather
easy
as
well
3
years
thats
how
long
it
has
been
i
didnt
know
at
the
time
that
i
would
be
turned
into
a
weizen
bock
fan
i
was
at
the
time
23
and
big
into
the
hoppiest
ipas
around
the
glockenspiel
caught
me
off
guard
and
surprised
me
with
its
variety
of
taste
fullness
and
overall
complexion
this
was
an
unforgettable
brew
this
is
nothing
short
of
the
best
looking
forward
to
the
next
beer
to
top
this
one
drinkability
an
excellent
beer
from
gl
these
are
too
easy
to
knock
back
it
took
some
effort
to
save
this
last
one
for
review
great
example
of
the
style
by
great
lakes
the
alcohol
in
here
is
not
totally
hidden
but
it
didnt
stop
me
from
downing
all
4
of
these
delicious
d
great
flavor
and
body
the
aroma
was
not
as
clean
as
expected
as
the
alcohol
was
a
little
more
pronounced
and
i
know
at
8
it
will
be
more
noticeable
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
drinkability
darn
good
beer
color
is
a
cloudy

with
hanging
carbonation
bock
definitely
comes
to
mind
in
both
the
vision
and
taste
after
the
1st
taste
im
waiting
for
something
else
to
happen
but
it
doesnt

virtually
no

or

notes
to
speak
of
wheat
is
upfront
but
generally
this
tastes
like
a
mediocre
ice
beer
very
onedimensional
and
almost
seems
like
a
crafty
way
to
get
rid
of
expensively
mind
you
bottomofthebarrel
hefeweizen
i
didnt
like
it
at
all
i
gave
away
the
other
3
beers
from
my
4pack
d
i
would
order
a
second
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
sixer

no
problem

a

extremely
drinkable
no

very
nicely

fairly
hidden
and
very
refreshing
mmmmmm
nice
brew
poured
aggresively
and
got
an
ok
tan

that
quickly
subsided
with
no
lace
color
is
a
hazy
copper
aroma
is
a
bavarian
hefeweizen
with
loads
of
malt
flavor
is
like
aroma
with
lots
of
caramel
and
some
toffee
great
body
and
carbonation
finish
is
a
bit
sweet
but
decent
thoughts
are
like
this
this
is
weizenbock
this
is
a
world
class
brew
the
only
thing
i
say
that
surpasses
it
is
aventinus
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
good
it
was
really
a
delicious
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
would
definitely
buy
again
more
bock
than
weizen
strong
on
smooth
moderately
roasted
malt
but
fell
short
on
any
yeasty
notes
i
had
hoped
to
come
through
with
the
wheat
heritage
a
touch
harsh
at
the
very
end
with
some
rough
etoh
but
otherwise
a
less
distinctive
beer
than
i
expected
dextremely
easy
to
drink
so
smooth
and
tasty
brings
a
nice
mixture
of
tastes
another
great
great
lakes
beer
they
are
awesome
overall
a
tasty
beer
expect
a
proper
full
bodied
weizenbock
here
and
not
a
pale
version
as
many
have
become
accustomed
to
due
to
the
rising
popularity
of
vitus
and
ayinger
which
they
deserve
as
they
are
great
but
this
is
not
the
same
style
of
beer
i
like
that
about
it
though
and
i
like
the
fact
that
it
actually
displays
some
imperial
characteristics
a
fine
libation
and
one
i
would
be
happy
to
imbibe
pretty
regularly
when
looking
for
a
nice
sweet
wheat
beer
without
going
all
wheatwine
on
my
liver
a
good
representation
of
the
style
for
sure
d
pretty
drinkable
all
the
flavors
were
there
in
the
right
amounts
and
were
pretty
good
taste
has
a
nice
spiciness
to
it
with
a
banana
bread
and
cherry
type
flavor
but
there
is
also
a
noticeable
alcohol
taste
there
as
well
very
good
flavor
but
not
too
heavy
making
it
easy
to
drink
d
its
drinkable
but
nothing
about
it
screams
exceptional
by
any
means
worth
a
shot
but
im
no
hurry
for
another
it
doesnt
appear
to
have
made
the
2010
lineup
i
wont
miss
it
dyummy
beer
that
is
definitely
a
winner
worth
getting
its
hard
to
find
a
bad
beer
from
this
brewery
and
this
beer
manages
to
hold
its
own
with
the
big
boys
while
still
managing
to
include
its
own
distinctive
twist
in
the
style
the
more
great
lakes
i
have
the
more
i
like
them
d
a
very
good
drinker
little
less
than
a
finger
of
deep
tan
cream
colored
head
dissipates
rapidly
into
scattered
islands
of
bubbles

helps
it
hold
light
and
deepen
the
glow
in
the
amber
red
orange
rust

excellent
representation

the
style
very
well
done
d
this
was
a
good
stab
at
this
style
and
i
look
forward
to
it
next
year
nice
work
on
this
one
great
lakes
d
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
at
a
bar
or
buy
a
single
of
but
im
not
sure
id
want
a
four
pack
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
just
not
one
of
great
lakess
better
offerings
d
a
tasty
complex
delicious
weizenbock
from
great
lakes
full
of
interesting
flavors
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
what
is
a
rather
big
beer
if
you
can
find
this
seasonal
its
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
only
great
lakes
distributed
all
the
way
to
dc
overall
impression
doesnt
look
like
much
but
a
fairly
complex
and
tasty
interpretation
of
the
style
recommended
mouthfeeldrinkability
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
fairly
low
level
of
carbonation
which
just
enhances
the
smoothes
of
the
beer
and
helps
to
increase
the
drinkability
medium
bodied
and
creamy
smooth
the
carbonation
was
really
kept
in
check
leading
to
the
great
texture
this
was
a
great
beer
consisting
of
a
lot
of
wheat
beer
characteristics
and
yet
so
much
more
lacks
the
depth
of
better
examples
of
the
style
but
nicely
drinkable
d
good
but
just
kind
of
lacks
character
and
body
taste
is
a
bit
wearing
as
well
not
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
glockenspiel
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
much
enjoyed
this
bottle
it
simply
isnt
the
epitome
of
the
style
like
most
all
great
lakes
offerings
tend
to
be
i
dont
know
whether
its
the
wrong
water
profile
perhaps
there
was
not
enough
malt
used
in
the
end
i
feel
satisfied
enough
to
say
ive
had
a
good
beer
but
not
enough
to
say
ive
had
a
good
weizenbock
pours
an
orange
copper
color
with
a
slight
one
finger
head
and
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
banana
and
some
honey
along
with
a
hint
of
clove
and
some
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
of
a
sweet
malt
backbone
with
banana
and
honey
flavors
over
the
top
of
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
has
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
and
is
slightly
watery
overall
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
to
make
you
shy
away
from
it
a
solid
beer
purchased
from
discount
liquor
in
milwaukee
wi
pours
a
ruby
red
body
with
a
light
tan

eventually
fades
aroma
that
resembles
single
malt
scotch
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
flavor
is
smooth
maltiness
no
detectable
bitterness
goes
down
easy
especially
for
8
alcohol
d
i
think
it
finishes
out
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
this
is
my
first
for
the
style
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
this
poured
a
clear
dark
copper
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
banana
and
honey
wheat
and
nutty
malt
with
some
caramel
it
tasted
like
honey
wheat
and
banana
nut
breads
with
some
caramel
and
coriander
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
wasnt
as
thick
or
complex
as
slam
dunkel
but
it
was
cleaner
and
seemed
more
true
to
style
alcohol
was
apparent
but
not
too
harsh
so
this
was
still
easy
enough
to
drink
decent
beer
but
not
anything
great
i
think
it
takes
a
truly
amazing
weizenbock
to
impress
me
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
damn
drinkable
and
the
abv
is
no
where
to
be
found
moreys
bottom
line
the
best
weizenbock
ive
tried
to
date
i
even
like
it
a
bit
more
than
victorys
moonglow
very
nice
and
an
interesting
take
on
this
styleone
which
would
take
a
few
more
meetings
with
to
really
wrap
the
taste
buds
around
properly
despite
the
8
this
is
a
weizenbock
i
could
sip
on
all
night
unique
but
simple
and
certainly
up
to
great
lakes
standards
thanks
to
kels
for
her
wonderful
generosity
notes
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
weizenbock
its
alcohol
was
very
noticeable
at
first
but
mellows
as
you
drink
and
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
light
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
hops
nothing
special
to
keep
you
having
more
than
one
but
it
is
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
light
d
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
no
vitus
final
thought
excellent
brew
might
be
great
lakes
best
offering
worth
saving
for
a
great
occasion
d
reminds
me
more
of
standard
weizen
not
nearly
as
good
as
some
of
the
german
weizenbocks
ive
had
but
not
a
bad
beer
overall
a
great
weizenbock
up
there
with
aventinus
although
there
are
alot
of
weizenbocks
ive
yet
to
try
recommended
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
the
abv
is
covered
well
the
lack
of
banana
smell
or
taste
is
a
little
disappointing
drinks
alright
good
but
not
one
of
the
better
weizenbocks
out
there
not
up
to
the
usual
stellar
results
i
get
from
great
lakes
usually
drinkability
what
can
i
say
but
smooth
and
easy
ill
certainly
be
purchasing
more
of
this
in
the
future
d
flavor
wasnt
outstanding
but
a
drinkable
beer
all
the
same
single
from
rileys
madison
wi
best
by

its
just
about
perfect
on
a
cool
fall
evening
the
finish
is
nice
and
crisp
and
leaves
your
mouth
just
dry
enough
to
prevent
a
person
from
putting
their
glass
down
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
d
light
as
hell
could
knock
em
down
overall
this
is
a
big
bavarian
wheat
beer
that
reminds
me
of
saranac
black
forest
and
a
good
hefeweizen
combined
definitely
recommended
although
admittedly
i
have
not
had
many
offerings
of
this
style
d
a
great
way
to
unwind
at
the
end
of
a
fall
day
make
this
your
first
beer
and
sip
it
slowly
i
could
easily
order
two
of
these
at
a
bar
and
will
be
really
happy
to
get
this
again
sometime
bravo
md
nice
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
alcohol
could
be
better
hidden
a
good
nite
cap
here
or
this
would
make
a
fine
cigar
companion
great
lakes
glockenspiel
a
weizenbock
ale
is
yet
another
home
run
for
a
craft
brewery
that
makes
a
habit
of
hitting
style
after
style
out
of
the
park
grassroots
ale
being
the
most
recent
exception
heres
hoping
that
this
stuff
is
still
on
the
shelves
in
ohio
next
week
failing
that
ill
be
sure
to
stock
up
bigtime
next
spring
highly
recommended
das
expected
another
fine
beer
from
great
lakes
wouldnt
put
it
in
my
top
3
but
well
worth
drinking
this
pours
a
translucent
caramel
brown
color
with
a
very
light
fizzy
tan
head
smells
of
sweet
banana
clove
and
bubblegum
taste
is
sweet
and
slightly
spicy
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
alcohol
more
banana
and
cloves
are
apparent
with
possibly
some
brown
sugar
for
a
beer
this
high
in
abv
id
even
call
it
fairly
light
and
refreshing
awesome
drinkability
is
high
despite
the
thickness
of
this
beer
at
8
i
might
even
argue
this
to
be
an
imperial
weizenbock
but
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
didnt
even
notice
it
until
i
saw
it
on
ba
even
then
i
was
shocked
to
learn
it
was
so
high
overall
id
say
this
is
a
definate
winner
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
to
toss
back
warming
and
full
in
the
mouth
the
beer
coats
without
cloying
up
front
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
dominates
with
alcohol
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
finish
as
the
beer
warmed
the
alcohol
becomes
more
pronounced
not
surprising
at
8
abv
in
addition
an
astringency
began
to
seep
into
the
flavor
an
astringency
that
was
not
at
all
unpleasant
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
one
of
such
a
robust
alcohol
level
it
tastes
like
a
fall
afternoon
and
its
drinkability
would
make
it
a
great
pregame
beer
d
much
higher
than
i
would
expect
for
a
8
bock
beer
for
the
style
drinkability
may
be
5
over
all
it
would
be
much
lower
but
still
pretty
decent
very
enjoyable
beer
from
a
very
enjoyable
brewery
another
must
try
from
the
folks
at
glbc
an
aggressive
pour
yielded
barely
a
one
finger
head
the
bottle
claims
plumcolored
and
full
bodied
our
gockenspiel
combines
spicy
notes
of
clove
and
banana
with
a
complex
finish
i
couldnt
have
said
it
better
myself
the
color
of
this
beer
is
extraordinary
the
banana
is
very
present
and
one
of
the
overwhelming
traits
of
this
beer
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
at
8
abv
you
can
tell
the
alcohol
is
there
this
is
not
a
session
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
i
originally
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
great
lakes
brewery
about
2
years
ago
and
it
was
just
as
tasty
as
i
remembered
d
this
is
an
excellent
weizenbock
with
some
really
rich
flavors
this
is
probably
one
of
great
lakes
better
tasting
beers
the
aroma
might
be
improved
but
its
quite
good
nonetheless
looks
beautiful
clear
dark
crimson
tone
creamy
beige
head
moderate
amounts
of
lace
nice
aroma
of
wheat
chocolate
spice
clove
and
banana
the
aroma
translates
over
very
nicely
in
this
beer
to
the
palate
i
get
the
nice
thick
wheaty
base
nice
little
sweetness
from
the
residuals
clove
vanilla
and
banana
all
accent
nicely
with
a
little
cracked
black
pepper
thrown
into
the
mix
for
good
measure
full
bodied
and
very
agreeable
on
the
palate
surprise
surprise
another
winner
from
my
favorite
brewery
pours
a
ruby
and
dark
copper
amber
copper
that
makes
e
think
of
oldfashioned
candy
not
much
of
a
head
or
bubbling
rui
cup
apricots
and
peaches
with
some
faint
toasted
malts
and
yeasty
bananas
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
super
juicey
upfront
and
full
of
fruit
the
middle
adds
some
caramel
to
to
the
fruit
lots
of
yeasty
bananas
in
the
finish
that
slowly
warms
tahtnks
to
the
alcohol
what
a
fruit
and
yeast
bomb
weizenbock
this
is
pretty
damn
good
d
dangerous
definitely
a
winner
four
fingers
of
dark
beige
head
here
though
i
felt
like
i
had
to
force
the
pour
to
get
the
beer
to
grace
the
height
of
the
glass
which
will
bring
the
scoring
on
appearance
down
a
bit
for
me
colors
of
the
body
include
dark
copper
plum
and
golden
edges
aromas
are
huge
out
of
the
pour
with
clove
and
ripe
banana
as
promised
on
the
label
tastes
are
similar
with
an
emphasis
on
the
ripe
banana
this
is
a
tasty
brew
though
its
a
bit
hot
with
time
and
warmth
a
tart
fruitiness
comes
out
which
is
a
nice
addition
mouthfeel
includes
a
lighter
body
than
id
like
with
mild
carbonation
i
am
a
fan
of
this
beer
but
its
hard
to
love
a
weizenbock
after
youve
had
aventinus
and
vitus
id
buy
it
again
but
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
great
lakes
d
a
drier
easier
to
drink
weizenbock
than
is
typical
for
the
style
and
i
think
it
works
to
the
advantage
especially
at
8
poured
from
the
bottle
to
my
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
murky
brown
with
a
nice
looking
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
it
forms
a
thin
white
ring
around
my
glass
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
it
smells
german
to
me
by
that
i
mean
i
get
the
wheat
and
yeast
and
maybe
a
bit
of
malt
its
nice
and
pretty
good
for
the
style
the
taste
reveals
none
of
the
8
alc
instead
its
wheaty
and
flavorful
without
being
overpowering
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
is
pretty
good
the
mouthfeel
just
feels
right
its
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
almost
a
session
beer
except
for
the
alcohol
it
contains
great
lakes
rarely
disappoints
and
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
one
of
the
midwests
best
i
went
all
the
way
to
wi
and
bought
this
beer
and
brought
it
all
the
way
back
to
oh
where
i
live
what
a
waste
d
this
style
really
should
be
listed
as
my
favorite
in
fact
im
changing
it
after
this
review
the
fullness
of
the
wheat
coupled
with
the
yeast
makes
a
winner
in
my
book
d
crisp
and
refreshing
its
a
good
cross
over
from
some
belgian
styles
into
a
nice
warm
weather
german
ale
drinkability
is
decent
the
alcohol
does
become
apparent
upon
a
bit
of
warming
and
hurts
the
drinkability
but
overall
this
is
a
nicely
composed
weizenbock
the
flavorts
work
well
together
and
do
not
end
up
overbearing
this
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
brews
to
this
point
from
glbc
and
my
mood
would
determine
whether
id
go
for
an
edmund
fitzgerald
or
one
of
these
drinkability
another
aboveaverage
brew
from
great
lakes
a
brewery
that
seems
to
continuously
hit
their
mark
with
surprising
accuracy
theyre
never
perfect
w
the
possible
exception
of
the
ba
blackout
stout
which
was
fracking
tasty
but
theyre
always
enjoyable
and
this
ones
no
different
a
traditional
weizenbock
that
is
if
you
can
call
any
example
of
the
style
traditional
given
how
broad
the
stylistic
definition
is
that
falls
more
towards
the
roastier
fruitier
end
of
the
spectrum
this
ones
definitely
one
i
could
see
keeping
in
my
fridge
at
8
0
abv
its
not
exactly
a
chugger
but
i
sure
found
myself
putting
it
away
fairly
quickly
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
or
weizenbocks
but
this
one
is
really
nice
probably
the
best
weizenbock
ive
ever
had
and
i
especially
love
the
rich
malty
base
off
of
which
the
other
flavors
work
rather
than
dominating
with
banana
and
clove
really
good
stuff
some
alcohol
is
noticable
lighter
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
overly
complex
but
pretty
solid
d
big
and
bold
flavor
but
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
however
a
half
a
bottle
mixed
with
another
12
oz
or
so
of
water
or
chicken
stock
or
lighter
beer
makes
a
ridiculously
good
bath
for
simmering
german
sausages
presently
knackwurst
weisswurst
and
bratwurst
poured
clear
orange
with
a
little
head
that
disappeared
quickly
the
aroma
was
of
heavy
banana
the
taste
was
largely
bananas
too
with
a
malty
sweetness
it
felt
a
little
thick
going
down
but
not
unpleasantly
you
could
drink
several
of
these
but
because
of
an
8
0
abv
probably
shouldnt
overall
an
above
average
beer
not
stellar
hv
one
other
point
this
stuff
absolutely
smokes
grassroots
ale
if
you
have
any
hesitation
picking
it
up
due
to
a
poor
experience
with
grassroots
let
it
go
this
beer
deserves
a
purchase
its
good
stuff
and
far
superior
to
grassroots
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
around
this
was
a
pretty
good
weizenbock
though
not
really
my
favorite
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
this
style
for
sure
lightly
toasted
malt
up
front
spicy
hop
flourish
prologue
to
big
fruity
yeasty
bready
malts
rummy
banana
bread
pear
liqueur
concord
grapes
and
sugary
malts
banana
bitter
finish
with
a
flourish
of
spicy
hops
warming
thick
wheaty
full
body
creamy
feel
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
and
dangerously
drinkable
on
this
cool
summer
day
overall
not
the
best
weizenbock
in
the
world
but
a
solid
offering
from
glbc
this
beer
should
come
in
12packs
i
just
tasted
the
schneinderbrooklyner
hopfenweiss
the
other
day
and
these
are
definitely
two
unique
interpretations
of
the
style
id
have
a
hard
time
picking
a
favorite
d
very
enjoyable
not
the
kind
of
beer
i
crave
but
id
like
to
have
it
again
i
drank
it
after
a
7
hour
drive
and
it
was
a
perfect
sophisticated
thirst
quencher
definately
a
good
beer
for
people
who
appreciate
good
beer
not
by
any
means
a
starter
beer
for
those
just
getting
into
microbrews
overall
its
good
to
have
but
i
wish
it
was
a
full
size
0
5l
bottle
rather
than
a
12oz
so
id
say
that
was
a
good
in
regards
to
drinkability
in
that
i
wanted
more
for
the
whole
glass
as
i
drink
this
there
is
no
lacing
whatsoever
left
on
the
glass
but
i
am
beginning
to
detect
more
of
the
alcohol
near
the
end
of
each
sip
reaching
the
bottom
of
the
glass
am
i
disappointed
that
i
have
no
more
to
drink
sadly
this
is
the
last
one
in
my
four
pack
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
this
beer
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
my
very
first
weizenbock
kudos
to
the
chef
nose
is
spiced
apples
alcohol
and
faint
gingerbread
flavor
has
a
similar
profile
a
phenolic
medicinal
note
and
clove
spice
seem
to
dominate
with
an
alcohol
heat
behind
it
trace
cinnamon
and
cookie
flavors
are
in
there
too
but
it
lacks
a
cohesiveness
and
fullness
that
good
weizenbocks
have
more
of
a
sipper
due
to
the
perceptible
alcohol
d
not
overly
sweet
just
enough
spice
make
this
beer
easy
too
enjoy
the
alcohol
content
is
not
really
noticeable
a
good
offering
from
great
lakes
d
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
would
make
a
great
but
dangerous
summer
beer
the
abv
stays
very
well
hidden
notes
cant
really
taste
the
8
abv
of
this
beer
its
really
odd
this
beer
is
pretty
pricy
going
around
8
bucks
at
a
bar
so
not
a
good
beer
to
be
drinking
all
the
time
unless
u
have
deep
pockets
let
it
warm
enjoy
this
is
one
of
glbc
finest
d
great
for
this
abv
really
i
could
have
the
whole
4
pack
an
exceptional
introduction
to
this
style
for
me
and
a
reason
to
keep
an
open
mind
about
maltforward
beers
with
unique
pronounced
yeast
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
each
time
im
blown
away
when
i
try
a
new
beer
from
great
lakes
add
this
one
to
the
nearly
perfect
list
overall
this
style
is
fairly
difficult
to
find
and
this
really
is
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
had
great
lakes
hit
a
home
run
with
this
beer
if
only
it
were
bottle
conditioned
lovely
beer
on
a
hot
day
found
at
premiere
gourmet
pours
peachy
golden
with
a
white
head
pleasant
banannas
and
a
tad
cloves
aroma
taste
is
orange
wheat
with
some
spice
pepper
saisonish
that
way
most
fresh
and
dangerously
drinkable
alcohol
well
hidden
another
notch
in
the
belt
for
great
lakes
there
are
a
few
things
that
might
be
tweaked
here
but
i
cant
realistically
argue
as
i
gluttonously
slop
it
down
taste
was
very
appealing
with
vanilla
caramel
yeast
and
malt
very
well
balanced
and
a
sweet
finish
mouth
feel
was
medium
carbonation
and
i
was
not
able
to
tell
this
was
8
one
of
the
best
american
wheats
i
have
had
12oz
poured
a
redbrown
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
was
quick
to
dissipate
into
nothing
aromas
were
malty
at
first
caramel
and
toffee
some
hints
of
clove
initial
tastes
were
loaded
with
malts
toffee
and
caramel
up
front
quickly
the
weisse
qualities
intermingled
bready
yeasts
clove
and
banana
notes
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
leaves
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
finishes
wellbalanced
and
slightly
dry
but
only
enough
for
you
to
want
another
sip
overall
very
good
take
on
a
german
classic
another
great
brew
from
great
lakes
taste
is
huge
caramel
malts
but
a
surprisingly
large
amount
of
smoke
and
peat
thin
to
medium
in
mouthfeel
a
little
amount
of
carbonation
fairly
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
drinks
like
water
being
8
and
is
even
refreshing
overall
a
rather
pleasant
and
surprising
beer
from
my
favorite
brewery
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
for
friends
d
the
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
and
the
sweetness
isnt
overbearing
one
of
the
more
memorable
beers
from
great
lakes
the
12
oz
bottle
was
woefully
inadequate
for
the
pour
into
my
much
larger
weizen
glass
as
a
side
note
i
corrected
this
problem
by
emptying
two
bottles
into
my
next
serving
color
was
a
purpleish
amber
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
i
immediately
noticed
a
banana
and
clove
scent
more
akin
to
many
belgian
beers
there
are
all
kinds
of
flavors
going
on
while
the
banana
dominates
you
get
clove
wheat
caramel
plums
and
a
nice
bready
yeast
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
considering
the
high
abv
and
ill
be
drinking
plenty
more
of
this
as
far
as
german
weizenbocks
go
this
is
easily
my
favorite
one
to
date
the
sweetness
is
pretty
tame
and
there
is
a
great
complimentary
banana
and
spice
flavor
great
lakes
does
this
style
proud
and
anyone
who
like
german
beers
should
seek
this
baby
out
jonathan
passow
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brownishamber
color
the
head
is
a
coulpe
inches
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
banana
tangy
wheat
and
hints
of
clove
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
magnified
and
with
a
slight
alcohol
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
weizenbock
that
i
would
love
to
drink
again
great
lakes
glockenspiel
is
a
dim
hazy
reddish
brown
ale
with
a
yellowish
offwhite
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
it
has
a
sweet
spicy
estry
aroma
with
notes
of
banana
clove
raisin
fig
apple
coriander
and
black
pepper
its
full
bodied
and
syrupy
with
a
sticky
finish
it
seems
a
touch
scratchy
its
quite
sweet
with
all
of
the
aroma
elements
present
in
the
flavor
its
a
little
resiny
leathery
and
phenolic
with
an
alcoholic
aftertaste
its
pretty
good
but
i
couldnt
see
reaching
for
a
second
one
drinkability
easy
street
eric
overall
not
even
close
to
the
best
weizenbock
ive
had
but
still
a
good
beer
medium
carbonation
with
a
medium
full
body
a
little
watery
on
the
tongue
satisfying
but
not
overwhelming
almost
refreshing
dangerously
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
overall
impression
is
an
almost
clinical
grafting
of
the
weizen
and
bock
styles
that
is
a
very
pleasant
drink
but
suffers
in
comparison
with
the
aventinus
in
that
it
does
not
have
the
originals
depth
or
sense
of
richness
im
picking
at
nits
now
we
cant
all
be

and
great

glockenspiel
stands
on
its
own
as
a
very
nice
flavorful
weizenbock
it
would
be
great
to
see
a
straight
hefeweizen
from
them
in
wide
distribution
future
outlook
4s
all
around
for
another
rock
solid
great
lakes
offering
ill
be
happy
to
reprise
drinking
this
beer
when
the
next
opportunity
to
doff
this
semilocal
offering
arises
once
again
just
not
lively
enough
for
something
in
the
weizen
family
fullbodied
however
and
highly
drinkable
for
something
of
its
strength
an
excellent
addition
to
the
gl
roster
goes
down
silky
smooth
d
wow
this
being
the
second
release
from
great
lakes
this
year
that
i
just
am
not
at
all
impressed
with
they
need
to
bring
back
that
old
beers
that
were
much
tastier
than
these
overall
a
strong
offering
from
great
lakes
cant
wait
to
try
on
tap
when
i
make
it
back
to
cleveland
d
i
could
see
drinking
this
again
though
i
dont
know
if
it
is
the
best
example
of
the
style
has
moderate
carbonationi
feel
like
its
fitting
for
the
style
its
an
easy
drinking
beerno
hint
of
alcohol
at
all
at
8
i
picked
up
a
4pack
of
this
at
the
brewpub
gift
shop
this
week
i
think
it
will
be
distributed
to
columbus
soon
but
i
wanted
it
now
the
beer
is
clear
dark
copper
color
with
a
2
finger
offwhite
foam
that
sank
quickly
the
aroma
is
strong
with
bananas
a
phenolheavy
type
of
weizenbock
my
favorite
type
the
taste
is
also
big
on
bananas
with
spice
and
a
little
alcohol
very
tasty
and
filling
very
good
competition
for
aventinus
drinkability
moderate
to
high
i
would
say
its
a
wonderful
tasting
beer
but
its
a
little
heavy
so
i
wouldnt
want
to
sit
around
and
have
too
many
because
i
would
feel
weighed
down
the
abv
is
getting
up
there
too
at
8
not
that
its
especially
high
but
i
can
already
feel
it
creeping
up
on
me
very
nice
beer
overall
and
well
worth
the
wait
and
hunting
for
it
pours
a
hazy
cooper
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retention
and
just
a
bit
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
dark
fruitsclove
and
banana
body
is
medium
with
some
carbonation
taste
is
nicely
spiced
with
fruity
and
malty
notes
through
out
light
version
of
this
style
but
not
bad
12oz
bottle
pours
a
disappointingly
clear
copper
with
a
small
pale
yellow
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
incredibly
strong
smell
of
bananas
and
dates
clove
and
slight
tart
wheat
aromas
in
the
background
tastes
of
banana
and
clove
overall
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
that
gives
it
a
slightly
warming
finish
mediumfull
body
this
would
be
a
really
nice
weizenbock
if
it
only
looked
the
part
an
interesting
sipper
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me
but
that
is
perhaps
typical
of
the
style
i
always
enjoy
something
new
from
glbc
and
they
didnt
disappoint
d
quite
drinkable
for
the
8
abv
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
but
a
bit
subdued
compared
to
some
others
ive
had
notably
the
victory
weizenbock
12
ounce
bottle
best
by
11112009
its
nice
to
finally
see
this
brew
being
bottled
served
in
a
weizen
glass
the
beer
pours
a
dark
redamber
color
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
excellent
lacing
is
good
the
bubbles
come
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
to
the
top
long
after
the
initial
pour
it
smells
like
cloves
bananas
figs
plums
and
wheat
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
not
quite
as
strong
it
tastes
like
cloves
bananas
yeast
dark
fruit
wheat
and
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
the
flavor
lingers
long
after
you
take
a
drink
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
and
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
pretty
good
too
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
ill
definitely
have
to
buy
another
4
pack
soon
since
this
is
a
seasonal
beer
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
since
its
the
only
seasonal
i
havent
seen
yet
poured
a
nice
amber
color
nice
clove
scent
with
some
fruity
tones
very
complex
flavors
not
the
overpowering
clovebanana
taste
i
was
expecting
overall
a
very
good
bock
that
goes
great
with
the
season
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
clean
with
fairly
strong
carbonation
drinkability
despite
the
high
abv
this
is
a
pretty
excellent
drinker
especially
for
the
season
wow
could
not
believe
i
found
this
at
the
grocery
store
great
lakes
must
have
just
started
bottling
it
pours
a
white
puffy
head
leaves
a
bit
of
tracing
down
the
glass
smells
of
cloves
bananas
and
plums
very
rich
smelling
pours
almost
a
ruby
red
colour
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
plummy
orange
tastes
and
bunches
of
cloves
i
love
the
clovey
tastes
in
weizens
dangerously
drinkable
alcohol
is
detected
however
and
it
is
strong
i
love
weizenbocks
and
they
are
hard
to
find
great
sipper
here
by
great
lakes
they
can
do
no
wrong
every
beer
they
create
is
full
of
flavor
and
most
in
the
top
ten
for
their
style
this
weizenbock
is
no
different
this
is
a
kitchensink
beer
where
every
flavor
can
be
found
in
compliment
to
one
another
the
beer
pours
with
an
expected
cloudiness
but
an
unexpected
ligher
rust
color
great
head
formation
with
equally
great
retention
aromas
are
everywhere
carameltoffe
maltiness
bready
yeastiness
fruity
banannas
apples
figs
dates
phenolic
clove
and
white
pepper
flavors
comply
nicely
with
the
aromas
with
emphasis
on
the
sweet
caramel
malts
with
all
other
attributes
to
provide
variety
and
complexity
a
citrus
hop
note
is
noted
in
the
ester
profile
and
gains
intensify
going
deep
into
the
aftertaste
bready
and
malty
in
the
textures
with
a
deep
creamy
roundness
finishes
sweet
malty
and
with
a
spicy
hoppy
lingering
dwell
done
certainly
up
there
with
some
of
the
finest
wbocks
i
have
had
big
bold
chewy
flavourful
and
smooth
what
more
could
you
ask
for
and
the
name
gotta
love
it
ein
prosit
d
very
easy
to
drink
8
is
no
where
to
be
found
until
the
buzz
shows
up
damn
fine
beer
d
drinkability
is
very
good
at
8
i
would
normally
limit
8
brews
at
one
per
sitting
but
this
one
goes
down
too
quick
and
easy
not
to
have
another
this
is
a
very
nice
weizenbock
overall
its
smooth
and
tart
at
the
same
time
banana
is
smooth
and
permeates
all
aspects
of
this
beer
id
really
like
to
see
this
make
it
into
a
bottle
as
a
regular
seasonal
offering
easily
recommended
d
a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
and
its
easy
to
drink
overall
a
really
nice
beer
cheers
pretty
nice
stuff
drinkability
another
area
in
which
this
beer
excels
many
wheat
beers
are
light
and
airy
but
this
one
is
bready
and
creamy
with
the
alcohol
not
cloying
this
is
a
definite
winner
try
it
youll
like
it
cheers
d
a
damn
fine
weizenbock
worth
a
special
trip
to
the
brewery
to
check
it
out
full
bodied
with
a
bitterness
that
lingered
like
that
of
the
wit
great
fallwinter
brew
appearance
pours
a
cloudy
deep
amber
brown
cinnamon
color
matched
with
a
dark
tan
cream
head
leaves
evenly
spread
lacing
throughout
my
pint
aroma
wonderful
doughy
spice
base
which
i
found
a
bit
weird
but
it
worked
well
somehow
apple
over
ripened
banana
and
raisin
notes
with
a
slightly
alcoholic
nose
very
nice
mix
all
around
taste
ripened
banana
apple
and
raisin
really
swarm
the
ol
palate
along
with
a
spicy
finish
with
a
noticeable
kiss
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
low
even
carbonation
not
as
fine
and
somewhat
spritzy
as
an
aventinus
drinkability
decent
shot
at
a
weizenbock
not
dead
on
to
the
style
but
very
good
and
shows
some
more
depth
from
this
great
brewery
m
very
unusual
with
the
alcohol
dominating
all
aspects
the
wheatwine
finish
is
a
nice
touch
a
flourish
of
sweet
wheat
and
alcohol
i
still
dont
think
that
the
wax
is
needed
first
sip
was
a
bit
of
a
shock
the
alcohol
does
come
across
a
bit
more
in
my
face
than
expected
almost
hot
ends
up
being
a
pretty
well
balance
brew
after
a
few
sips
a
good
stab
at
the
style
just
to
come
running
at
this
beer
ease
in
with
a
few
sips
this
is
an
almost
good
beer
its
intensely
grainy
and
taste
much
like
wheaties
the
yeast
does
a
good
job
imparting
some
fruity
esters
but
they
dont
overcome
the
grainy
and
alcoholic
components
that
overpower
here
its
also
much
more
bitter
than
i
had
expected
its
ultimately
drinkable
and
not
an
overall
bad
beer
but
for
this
style
i
would
look
elsewhere
medium
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
and
zesty
spice
much
hoppier
than
expected
with
some
earthy
grassy
flavor
along
with
some
pepper
coriander
and
citrus
some
bready
yeast
but
faint
not
much
else
going
on
bland
and
too
bitter
for
the
style
funky
aroma
on
this
thick
weizenbock
hits
the
style
a
decent
drinker
and
refreshing
some
bannana
and
not
significant
clove
some
orange
flavour
but
overall
not
exceptional
for
the
style
a
worthwhile
offering
above
average
cabonation
cloudy
appearance
strong
aroma
is
wheaty
and
fruity
with
a
yeasty
undertone
and
a
hint
of
butterscotch
it
pours
a
pretty
dark
golden
amber
that
is
slightly
hazy
and
has
a
fairly
thick
if
not
persistent
pale
goldentan
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
crisp
flavor
has
woody
wheaty
earthy
and
fruity
tones
with
hints
of
butterscotch
and
hops
smooth
firmbodied
texture
has
plenty
of
tingle
and
sass
and
leaves
a
fizzy
woody
finish
the
beer
is
a
hazy
dark
orange
color
pours
with
almost
no
head
any
evidence
of
which
recedes
to
a
very
thin
film
and
a
slight
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
no
lacing
at
all
aroma
has
a
big
banana
component
with
some
bubblegummy
notes
not
a
lot
of
the
spice
that
i
like
a
lot
from
this
type
of
yeast
strain
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
banana
bomb
lots
of
bananna
which
overtakes
anything
else
happening
in
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
nice
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
cloves
spices
and
subtle
bready
notes
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
bread
spices
alcohol
and
subtle
sugar
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
average
brew
i
really
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
one
while
all
of
the
traditional
flavors
of
a
weizenbock
were
there
they
were
just
way
to
blunt
and
invasive
on
the
palate
the
alcohol
bite
didnt
help
that
much
at
all
on
this
one
either
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
as
when
i
tried
it
was
retired
but
i
guess
it
is
back
o
i
enjoyed
this
more
and
more
as
i
drank
it
it
came
across
more
as
a
big
hefe
than
a
weizenbock
but
i
dont
care
i
still
liked
it

taste
is
mellow
and

it

a

weizenbock
hereits
not

but
it
lacks

in
my
opinion
overall
one
of
the
better
weizenbocks
ive

if
its
up

with
the
ones
at

pretty

this
weizen
bock
comes
in
a
22oz
bottle
with
green
wax
encasing
the
cap
an
upsidedown
goat
on
a
background
of
green
meadows
mountains
and
clouds
appears
on
the
label
the
brew
pours
a
dark
gold
with
a
fizzy
top
that
disappears
as
soon
as
it
arrives
it
is
practically
transparent
with
no
yeast
or
haze
obstructing
the
view
isnt
this
odd
for
a
wheat
beer
i
think
so
the
smell
is
spot
on
with
banana
clove
freshly
cut
hay
and
crisp
clean
hops
rounding
things
out
in
regards
to
the
flavor
the
dark
fruit
esters
that
normally
arise
with
this
style
arent
present
however
there
are
some
redeeming
characteristics
the
sweet
front
bananaclove
center
and
the
dry
hoppy
finish
with
a
lingering
weizenbock
aftertaste
okay
it
does
lose
points
for
not
being
truly
to
style
but
its
a
pleasure
to
drink
good
beer
from
ohb
this
beer
was
a
light
yellow
with
a
fair
head
the
smell
was
of
fresh
cut
hay
the
flavor
was
watery
wheat
and
a
little
bit
of
cream
ale
or
something
akin
to
boddingtons
drinkability
would
be
better
in
warmer
weather
the
abv
was
not
evident
but
i
could
still
only
manage
a
lackluster
reveiw
pretty
good
beer
head
not
very
strong
creamy
aroma
sweet
and
gentle
coffee
the
flavor
is
thick
slightly
bitter
caramel
and
a
little
coffee
drink
a
light
and
pleasant
very
solid
beer
clearly
underrated
i
cant
believe
im
enjoying
this
beer
tarwebok
is
an
okay
weizenbock
try
it
overall
a
good
beer
and
the
abv
of
65
doesnt
seem
to
be
that
obvious
which
in
combination
with
its
sweetness
makes
it
more
an
everyday
bock
beer
for
me
look
is
standard
with
some
initial
foam
over
an
amber
beer
etched
surface
nose
carries
cherry
and
toasted
brown
sugar
along
with
some
decent
bock
malts
taste
is
vanilla
sweet
wheat
and
fruity
a
little
thin
bodied
with
hi
carb
drinkable
o
this
is
okay
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
in
weizenbocks
o
first
try
with
this
style
of
beer
i
def
enjoyed
it
ive
read
up
on
it
a
bit
and
it
seems
this
style
can
run
the
gamit
on
the
sweetness
id
be
very
interested
in
trying
another
to
compare
this
to
and
also
try
this
on
tap
and
see
if
i
can
notice
much
of
a
difference
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
although
mild
there
were
some
nice
malts
and
sweeter
caramel
and
estery
inclusions
the
taste
however
was
too
sweet
and
became
overwhelming
at
points
additionally
it
was
felt
that
for
the
style
the
malts
were
a
bit
too
dark
overpowering
the
esters
and
phenols
both
of
which
we
would
have
liked
to
see
more
represented
o
this
was
a
nice
after
dinner
sipper
for
sure
likely
the
highlight
of
the
holiday
pack
from
heineken
i
would
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
always
yours
bock
beers
are
rather
hard
to
come
by
in
australia
so
this
is
a
rare
treat
and
a
far
more
interesting
beer
than
heinekens
usual
product
note
this
is
actually
a
weizenbock
as
it
is
brewed
with
17
wheat
malt
taste
has
a
good
balance
while
not
totally
balanced
of
hops
and
malt
bitter
enough
to
keep
it
tame
and
the
sweetness
is
followed
well
by
a
clean
finish
the
flavor
is
fantastic
i
was
definately
not
expecting
the
bumrush
of
hops
caramel
toffee
chocolate
and
alcoholic
notes
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
refreshing
as
the
medium
body
of
the
tarwebok
finishes
with
a
little
hoppy
bite
to
remember
it
by
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
a
moderate
amount
of
complexity
if
anything
its
a
bit
too
sweet
but
i
was
willing
to
overlook
that
fact
and
give
it
a
decent
rating
i
hope
i
run
into
this
one
again
taste
is
sweet
holy
crap
this
stuff
is
even
sweeter
than
i
thought
sticky
on
the
lipps
all
this
sweetness
overrules
any
other
taste
but
i
am
still
able
to
pick
up
the
roasted
and
dark
malts
it
tastes
like
the
fermentation
has
been
stopped
prematurely
what
an
incredible
sweetness
almost
like
molasses
have
been
thrown
into
water
and
partly
fermented
i
can
hardly
get
my
lipps
apart
drinkability
would
love
to
have
more
although
12
beers
per
session
definitely
not
the
beer
of
choice
if
you
want
to
binge
drink
binge
drinking
is
bad
by
the
way
sip
beer
defenitely
recommended
overall
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
a
very
nice
amber
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
aroma
is
classic
bock
sweet
caramel
aroma
it
has
a
medium
body
with
a
caramelly
beginning
thats
slightly
oily
on
the
tongue
and
finishes
dry
with
some
alcohol
its
a
bit
on
the
candy
sugar
sweet
vs
malty
sweet
but
not
a
bad
bock
overall
quite
simply
one
of
the
finest
beers
ive
ever
sampled
i
cant
believe
how
far
heineken
makers
of
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
the
lager
have
hit
it
out
of
the
park
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
tapers
off
to
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
figs
cinnamon
and
malt
taste
is
unbelievable
malty
with
hints
of
plum
sweetness
brown
sugar
a
touch
of
coffee
and
a
bit
of
rum
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
fulfilling
an
amazingly
complex
beer
with
a
slightly
sweet
smokey
finish
by
the
way
i
had
to
bring
this
back
from
aruba
unfortunately
heineken
does
not
seem
to
import
this
to
the
us
this
is
a
great
seasonal
beer
my
only
critique
might
be
to
rein
in
the
ginger
a
bit
the
body
is
good
but
drops
off
a
bit
as
it
goes
firm
crispness
not
too
hard
and
a
good
smoothness
to
it
pours
a
very
deep
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
burns
off
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
reminiscent
of
rumsoaked
raisins
the
body
has
a
little
more
characteristics
of
weizenbock
a
little
hint
of
lighter
fruits
but
the
rumraisin
combo
dominates
the
body
is
thinner
but
not
watery
and
has
a
nice
smooth
finish
to
it
my
new
favorite
from
this
brewery
the
smell
is
delicious
with
bananas
cherry
cinnamon
and
bread
the
taste
is
a
malt
bomb
it
has
the
banana
dark
wheat
and
subtle
oak
i
also
noticed
a
bit
of
black
cherry
this
may
be
my
favorite
holiday
beer
this
season
22
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
wheat
glass
nice
deep
brown
with
tint
of
ruby
good
tan
head
nice
caramel
aroma
with
strong
hints
of
the
wheat
while
present
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
was
all
malty
goodness
flavors
of
caramel
and
molasses
come
through
from
the
heavy
malt
while
just
enough
hops
to
provide
a
little
balance
no
real
hop
flavor
in
this
nice
flavor
and
very
smooth
to
drink
rum
barrel
flavoring
was
only
slight
overall
a
great
beer
bready
caramel
raisin
sweet
chocolate
toffee
and
the
jamaican
rum
barrel
adds
some
sweet
notes
just
a
great
seasonal
beer
22oz
bottle
served
in
my
gi
tulip
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
with
a
dense
twoinch
light
tan
colored
head
head
gradually
dissipates
into
a
quarter
inch
cap
leaving
creamy
swaths
of
lacing
in
its
wake
nose
is
consistent
with
a
weizenbock
however
a
bit
more
subdued
fruity
bananabubblegum
esters
a
trace
of
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
something
slightly
caustic
towards
the
back
which
ill
attribute
to
the
rum
barrel
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
i
really
dont
get
much
rum
barrel
here
that
said
fruity
esters
and
cocoa
in
the
nose
are
more
present
and
coalesce
together
nicely
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
n
body
with
an
even
carbonation
and
a
creamy
texture
overall
i
expected
a
bit
more
from
the
barrel
but
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
beer
given
the
ratings
very
enjoyable
with
a
wellhidden
abv
a
nice
holiday
beer
o
this
was
quite
enjoyable
and
the
rum
barrel
played
well
with
the
base
beer
nice
seasonal
o
i
have
a
suspicion
this
beer
improves
with
age
with
some
of
the
alcohol
heat
receding
to
let
more
of
the
malt
sweetness
and
yeast
esters
through
and
hopefully
a
bit
of
the
carbonation
dissipating
as
well
as
it
stands
its
not
bad
just
not
the
best
weizenbock
ive
ever
had
on
tap
from
flight
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
described
here
as
being
rum
barrel
aged
very
full
flavored
molasses
comes
to
mid
hops
are
noticably
absent
i
dont
mind
at
all
very
full
bodied
but
not
too
sweet
now
if
i
could
only
pinpoint
the
aftertaste
incredibly
it
has
the
mild
funk
of
a
blue
cheese
i
know
right
overall
a
tasty
beer
not
great
for
the
style
but
if
it
is
a
good
beer
i
could
care
less
dark
roasted
malt
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
burnt
sugar
with
some
hoppy
flavors
though
not
much
of
the
aromatics
some
burnt
taste
starts
each
sip
with
a
sugary
sensation
that
ends
in
the
back
of
the
throat
with
a
hint
of
bitter
cough
syrup
i
dont
really
taste
much
of
the
usual
german
wheat
esters
but
there
is
some
fruit
and
a
hint
of
banana
overall
this
sems
too
bitter
and
earthy
for
what
i
like
in
this
style
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
depot
liquor
in
brownwood
texas
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
the
8
49
price
for
the
22
oz
bottle
this
is
more
that
most
other
breweries
have
priced
22
oz
bottles
and
indeed
as
much
as
most
craft
beers
are
selling
for
in
six
packs
at
a
price
point
of
8
other
beer
options
are
more
attractive
the
fruit
esters
were
a
big
component
to
this
beer
as
well
as
a
thick
malt
profile
good
roundness
overall
nice
feel
and
quite
tasty
recommended
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
unknown
freshness
date
but
i
bet
its
ultra
fresh
this
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smells
are
a
little
of
roasted
malts
caramel
chocolate
and
a
little
fruit
and
sweetness
the
feel
is
medium
to
thick
and
creamy
the
taste
is
pretty
good
there
are
the
chocolate
flavors
along
with
some
sweetness
and
fruit
but
its
less
intense
than
i
expected
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
fresh
at
the
brewery
they
only
tapped
one
keg
and
it
went
fairly
quick
wanted
a
second
pint
but
it
had
already
kicked
will
look
for
this
in
bottle
o
rahr
did
a
very
good
job
with
this
beer
it
is
so
tasty
and
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
tasty
beer
which
was
a
bit
surprising
to
me
i
didnt
think
id
like
it
but
its
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
it
could
us
a
bit
more
complexity
but
thats
nitpicking
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
shockingly
so
well
carbed
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
a
few
swirls
of
the
glass
knocks
out
some
of
carbonation
and
helps
smooth
things
out
sweetness
is
just
about
right
just
enough
to
give
it
a
rich
body
and
offset
the
alcohol
which
is
big
smooth
out
the
alc
and
add
a
bit
more
roastilysmooth
chocolate
and
this
one
would
be
damn
near
worldclass
clap
clap
i
think
this
is
the
best
in
the
to
thee
series
since
the
bourbon
barrel
winter
warmer
better
as
it
warms
to
around
maybe
45
or
so
i
would
and
will
have
no
problem
sending
this
tasty
treat
out
in
trades
or
bifs
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
