NA
o
fucking
delicious
feels
like
having
a
stout
at
some
local
fisherman
pub
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
upnorth
great
experience
enjoy
ps
your
mother
was
a

the

color
is
black
the

it
disappear
quickly
elderberry
last
time
i
tasted
a
beer
with
that
it
wasnt
good
however
this
one
is
pretty
decent
i
think
the
roasted
malts
helps
here
some
chocolate
notes
and
dark
fruits
elderberry
in
the
mouth
its
complex
the
finish
is
bitter
that
start
light
but
finish
strong
chocolate
notes
and
roasted
malts
delicious
a
nice
good
beer
o
does
what
it
says
elderberry
and
it
delivers
i
would
think
of
it
like
a
porter
or
stout
in
its
scents
and
flavours
worth
a
try
and
would
go
well
with
elderberry
pie
overall
drinks
very
light
and
has
some
interesting
flavors
going
on
a
worthwhile
foray
into
the
gruit
field
o
this
is
a
real
interesting
beer
and
one
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
interesting
combination
of
aromas
and
flavors
with
well
hidden
alcohol
pours
a
black
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offtan

decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
alcohol
hint
of
grass
hint
of
citrus
and
hint
of
dry
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
scottish
gruit
ancient
herbed
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
low
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
noticeable
dryness
tastes
of
sweet
malt
citrus
slight
alcohol
hint
of
dry
hop
hint
of
grass
and
a
syrupy
sweetness
overall
interesting
beer
that
was
pungent
at
first
mellowed
by
the
finish
a
fruitforward
dry
and
herbally
black
ale
a
bit
cloyingly
dry
at
the
finish
a
bit
off
balanced
but
this
was
certainly
an
enjoyable
elderberry
beer
showing
off
a
good
enjoyable
ancient
ale

o
pretty
good
dark
ale
o
this
bottles
drink
by
date
was
2
years
past
when
i
cracked
it
open
so
this
probably
isnt
the
best
review
i
think
the
dull
stale
flavors
i
was
getting
was
a
dirrect
result
had
it
been
fresh
i
think
this
would
have
been
alot
better
tastes
just
as
roasty
and
fruity
with
tones
of
chocolate
raisins
dried
berry
and
an
unusual
herbal
tone
a
curious
melding
of
a
roasty
stout
and
a
fruit
ale
this
one
is
well
worthy
of
a
try
sure
ill
use
it
as
the
comparison
seems
like
it
is
what
its
intended
to
be
doesnt
knock
my
fastball
out
of
the
park
but
im
happy
ebulum
reached
base
o
rich
and
unusual
flavor
carries
the
aura
of
an
ancient
ale
overall
probably
the
best
from
this
wiliams
bros
gruit
mixed4
like
i
said
im
happy
gruit
day
is
over
not
exactly
my
style
of
beer
overall
not
bad
worth
the
single
price
i
paid
for
it
actually
would
be
nice
in
the
summer
o
a
unique
and
tasty
brew
that
had
a
decent
flavour
profile
and
was
easy
drinking
probably
my
favourite
of
the
series
and
glad
i
saved
it
for
last

an
excellent
b
ebulum
elderberry
black
ale
is
one
fruit
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
glass
of
i
often
find
fruit
beers
to
be
onedimensional
at
best
and
barely
beerlike
at
worst
but
this
particular
offering
has
proven
to
me
that
when
combined
with
some
spice
and
a
decent
dark
ale
base
they
have
the
potential
to
become
much
more
interesting
concoctions
i
am
now
halfway
through
this
brewerys
4pack
sampler
and
ebulum
is
the
second
brew
to
earn
an
enthusiastic
thumbs
up
o
the
flavor
is
good
but
it
is
more
reminiscent
of
a
dry
stout
than
a
fruit
beer
you
never
know
what
to
expect
with
a
specialty
historic
style
but
with
fruit
mentioned
so
prominently
on
the
label
i
wanted
to
taste

overall
an

tasty
and
intriguing
but
nothing
too
exceptional
overall
id
take
this
beer
over
many
standard
darkblack
craft
ales
any
day
but
it
has
some
flaws
there
is
a
lot
going
on
the
the
flavour
that
i
love
im
a
myrtle
junkie
but
the
appearance
and
the
mouthfeel
are
just
underwhelming
id
drink
this
everyday
if
it
wasnt
something
that
was
so
hard
to
find
as
hardtofind
beers
go
however
unless
you
need
a
hit
of
myrtle
or
want
to
try
something
a
little
different
this
might
not
hit
the
spot
overall
a
little
bland
this
is
the
first
i
have
had
of
the
genre
so
i
had
no
expectation
its
drinkable
but
the
aftertaste
may
offend
some
o
i
think
this
is
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
i
would
be
interested
to
try
more
this
particular
example
is
good
but
not
great
probably
wont
go
for
this
again
but
it
was
different
and
a
nice

overall
not
my
style
for
sure
the
berry
flavor
is
very
mild
and
not
the
featured
flavor
seems
like
spices
herbs
and
malts
are
the
main
flavor
spices
add
a
odd
bold
flavor
kinda
like
when
you
add
herbs
to
a
meal
and
the
top
of
shaker
falls
off
and
the
whole
container
falls
in
the
food
and
you
try
to
scrape
away
as
much
as
you
can
but
its
still
to
much
not
for
me
was
expecting
more
berry
flavor
o
very
smooth
and
easy
drinker
with
some
flavor
that
makes
it
appealing
my
wife
loved
this
one
my
first
williams
bros
beer
and
im
looking
forward
to
more
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
carbonation
doesnt
have
much
to
say
unless
you
hold
the
beer
on
your
tongue
it
isnt
sticky
or
coating
nor
is
it
dry
its
simple
poured
an
eighth
inch
mocha
colored
head
which
vanished
within
a
few
seconds
the
body
is
a
clear
burnt
umber
brown
color
nearly
coffee
smell
comes
across
rich
and
malty
taste
has
the
malt
an
acidic
zing
which
persists
through
the
finish
and
a
touch
of
fruit
which
must
be
the
elderberries
theres
both
coffee
and
cocoa
coming
across
in
the
finish
and
the
acidity
adds
a
spicey
nature
body
is
fairly
light
an
interesting
and
somewhat
unique
beer
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
it
has
the
perfect
ratio
of
roasted
malt
to
fruit
presence
i
get
a
little
burnt
aftertaste
that
slightly
detracts
from
the
overall
experience
d
a
solid
ale
but
in
spite
of
being
a
gruit
the
elderberries
are
integral
to
the
style
but
i
think
that
in
this
case
itd
be
better
without
them
as
a
plain
stout
or
porter
still
its
far
from
ruined
and
worth
a
try
notes
its
somewhat
thin
decent
flavor
and
some
decent
sweetness
cheers
overall
i
picked
this
up
since
i
like
strange
beers
and
an
elder
berry
black
ale
actually
worked
pretty
well
would
consider
trying
other
things
from
this
brewery
a
very
creamy
texture
well
melded
and
balanced
another
winner
from
williams
bros
the
herbals
are
subdued
in
this
one
but
its
a
pretty
fine
ale
it
goes
down
so
easy
yet
theres
a
nice
warming
punch
in
the
finish
pours
like
a
porter
thick
body
dark
caramel
ruby
almost
black
with
a
light

head
fine
speckled
lacing
aroma
has
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
light
fruitiness
really
roasty
like
a
porter
with
dark
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
coffee
roasts
flavor
is
great
a
big
rustic
porter
labeled
as
a
berry
infused
black
ale
that
works
to
it
still
tastes
like
a
creamy
dark
chocolateroasted
coffee
beer
this
is
probably
the
best
base
beer
with
the
ancient
ingredients
having
less
effect
than
any
of
the
other
ancient
ales
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
creamy
texture
very
enjoyable
with
mellow
carbonation
goes
down
easy
the
glass
literally
drains
itself
overall
a
solid
black
ale
that
regardless
of
the
label
theyre
putting
on
it
is
damn
good
pours
a
deep
dark
violet
bordering
on
black
but
some
deep
shades
of
red
come

ill
presume
hints

taste
has
more
roast
notes
dark

milk
chocolate
and
subtler
berry
notes
than
the
nose
had
presented
slight
metallic

smoke
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
relatively
low
carbonation
similar
to
almost
all
of
the
other
beers
in
this
pack
but
this
doesnt
detract
from
the
experience
at
all
and
almost
makes
this
somewhat
creamy
although
categorized
as
a
gruitherbed
ale
this
could
pass
as
a
black
ale
as
well
and
is
certainly
much
better
than
several
ive
had
from
that
style
nice
deep
brown

some

lightmed

thin
at

lightly

quite
an
interesting
brew
some
nice
flavours
and
scents
here
would
revisit
gladly
quite
a
solid
beer
id
make
this
a
goto
in
the
cold
weather
months
if
i
could
get
it
outside
the
historic
ales
of
scotland
gift
pack
this
was
the
last
of
my
taster
pack
from
the
lcbo
and
i
enjoyed
all
four
of
the
brews
immensely
will
definitely
seek
out
anything
i
see
from
this
brewer
in
the
future
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
notes
this
beer
has
less
body
than
i
expected
it
to
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
full
flavored
palate
its
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
and
a
unique
experience
but
nothing
that
stands
out
amongst
other
beers
of
the
style
still
worth
a
try
o
an
excellent
dark
ale
very
smooth
and
easy
but
really
blossoms
when
you
take
the
time
to
taste
its
subtler
qualities
very
good
moreys
bottom
line
really
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
beer
i
would
gladly
drink
it
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
for
those
who
like
a
good
malt
forward
beer
this
is
my
idea
of
a
stout
overall
it
is
a
nicely
balanec
and
enjoyable
beer
od
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
pretty
good
its
almost
like
a
stout
with
rootsberries
added
it
drinks
smooth
and
is
quite
enjoyable
the
aroma
is
more
fruity
while
the
body
is
stoutyer
so
id
prefer
the
fruit
to
carry
on
otherwise
good
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
for
a
session
but
its
tasty
and
wellcrafted
a
nice
suprise
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
hoped
for
something
bolder
from
an
elderberry
black
ale
nice
for
a
mild
dark
beer
d
good
brew
overall
worth
trying
definitely
different
yet
still
familiar
o
this
beer
seemingly
encompasses
many
different
beer
styles
that
i
enjoy
stout
saison
porter
bock
would
enjoy
enjoying
again
and
multiple
times
in
a
sitting
d
smooth

but
not
at
all
overwhelming
good
poured
out
black
with
of
hue
of
deep

a
small
amount
of

formed
and
then
dwindled
to
nothing
but
a
ring
around
the

aroma
is
huge
a

of

and
earthy
notes
darkfruityelderberryfigs
some
roasted

character
but
a

it
is

a

after

through
with

finish

and

at
the
end
also

good
amount

carbonation
complex
flavors
transition
throughout
sipping
this
beer
interesting
flavors
you
may
typically
find
in
a
barley
wine
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
black
color
the
head
had
some
good
body
to
it
but
didnt
last
very
long
the
lacing
was
scattered
and
thin
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
faint
fruity
aroma
mixed
with
some
roasted
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
some
elderberry
sweetness
to
it
upfront
that
faded
into
a
dark
toasted
dry
flavor
the
mouthfeel
of
the
been
is
very
smooth
and
had
just
enough
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
find
it
to
be
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
this
was
a
unique
beer
probably
the
strangest
thing
for
me
was
the
mouth
feel
it
left
my
mouth
feeling
raw
though
not
necessarily
in
a
bad
way
and
even
a
little
numb
it
pours
nearly
black
which
i
always
like
i
like
others
am
not
all
that
familiar
with
the
taste
of
elderberries
however
the
unique
flavor
of
the
berries
i
think
shines
through
without
being
overpowering
or
too
sweet
its
fairly
carbonated
which
i
was
surprised
about
its
not
really
very
bitter
though
it
does
have
a
slightly
sour
flavor
that
could
be
the
alcohol
peeking
through
at
the
end
i
enjoyed
it
if
it
were
readily
available
itd
be
an
occasional
buy
but
not
a
frequent
fridge
addition
as
part
of
that
historic
scottish
ales
variety
pack
however
it
was
a
great
addition
the
heather
beer
is
awesome
i
love
trying
beers
from
all
over
the
world
and
even
beers
from
across
time
ie
dogfish
and
this
was
certainly
a
unique
one
poured
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
a
small
whitish
head
smell
of
dried
fruits
and
a
little
bit
of
molasses
taste
was
of
dark
dried
fruits
ive
never
had
an
actual
elderberry
so
i
dont
know
exactly
what
they
taste
like
and
but
not
very
sweet
with
some
molasses
and
semisweet
chocolate
finishes
off
pretty
dry
with
a
tiny
acidic
twinge
medium
body
and
fairly
drinkable
but
a
little
disappointing
o
i
like
this
and
found
it
to
be
an
interesting
ale
on
cask
it
was
very
tasty
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
but
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
with
lots
of
distinct
fruity
characters
overall
it
is
simple
yet
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
notes
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
interesting
the
fruit
is
light
and
delicate
i
think
it
is
better
to
be
light
on
fruit
vs
heavy
and
syrupy
glad
i
tried
it
but
would
not
seek
this
out
again
started
out
so
promising
d
i
didnt
expect
to
like
this
beer
but
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
with
very
little
problems
d
drinks
alright
overall
its
a
nice
beer
but
its
probably
something
i
wouldnt
order
again
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
a
garnet
hue
light
tan
head
sits
atop
the
brew
for
a
bit
before
falling
back
down
the
nose
brings
forward
a
good
amount
of
the
elderberry
along
with
some
floral
notes
and
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
the
taste
hits
the
fruit
notes
pretty
well
with
the
gruit
herbs
playing
a
supporting
role
done
quite
well
the
body
is
medium
with
average
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
overall
a
nice
beer
i
was
glad
to
try
d
stuff
is
different
for
sure
which
is
what
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
not
sure
if
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
glass
of
this
stuff
though
this
is
an
ancient
beer
and
deserving
of
multiple
tastes
go
for
it
highly
recommended
get
out
there
and
try
a
taste
of
history
drink
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
a
fair
amount
it
had
an
interesting
flavour
and
id
drink
it
again
if
offered
d
another
riveting
ancient
scottish
beer
to
savour
i
suggest
you
give
it
a
try
not
a
must
have
but
fun
to
sample
something
rather
uncommon
i
could
drink
a
6
pack
of
these
and
really
have
a
fun
evening
d
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
a
mangled
flavor
profile
makes
this
a
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
d
the
flavor
profile
is
too
strong
and
unconventional
for
this
to
be
easily
drinkable
for
me
i
did
find
it
to
a
good
purchase
and
am
glad
i
have
tried
it
this
beer
made
me
interested
in
other
beers
with
elderberry
more
so
than
actually
drinking
more
of
this
beer
d
drinkability
is
high
this
beer
is
pretty
unique
but
doesnt
suffer
from
trying
to
be
different
for
the
sake
of
it
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
drinks
very
easily
d
this
is
a
very
intriguing
ale
and
has
a
lot
of
flavors
and
aromas
in
it
sadly
while
i
was
drinking
it
the
flavor
profile
seemed
to
start
to
fall
apart
and
get
watery
and
separated
quite
interesting
overall
though
its
not
really
something
id
want
to
have
all
the
time
small
brown
head
of
less
than
a
finger
and
fizzled
away
quickly
scant
lace
and
not
very
clingy
color
is
a
very
dark
red
a
38
on
the
srm
chart
sweet
smell
of
berries
clover
and
grain
sweet
tart
flavor
of
berries
caramel
and
malt
good
bold
feeling
in
my
mouth
not
a
beer
to
get
drunk
on
but
a
few
in
a
night
would
be
well
worth
it
pours
very
dark
brown
opaque
beer
with
decent
creamy
tan
head
almost
no
laces
nose
is
smoky
elderberry
elusive
dark
malts
taste
is
smooth
similar
to
the
aroma
but
more
malty
and
roasted
all
in
all
decent
and
well
drinkable
beer
drinkability
is
above
average
not
your
typical
everyday
beer
this
elderberry
ale
quite
a
unique
flavor
experience
one
that
might
take
some
getting
used
to
wouldnt
really
down
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
given
night
either
eric
the
first
that
ive
sampled
so
far
of
the
mixed
4pack
from
the
brewery
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
nose
is
an
interesting
mixture
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolatecovered
raspberries
flavour
leans
slightly
to
the
sweet
side
roasted
malt
is
noticeable
throughout
some
coffee
dark
fruitred
wine
flavours
nice
crisp
slightly
bittersour
finish
in
some
ways
reminiscient
of
a
dry
stout
mediumbodied
nice
softcreamy
mouthfeel
the
aroma
of
this
one
seemed
much
more
interesting
than
the
taste
itself
which
lacked
any
fruityberry
character
shown
in
the
nose
however
still
enjoyed
this
one
and
look
forward
to
the
other
3
in
the
series
bought
as
park
of
a
4
bottle
pack
from
this
brewery
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
colour
with
thin
tan
head
nice
head
retention
and
some
mild
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
with
some
fruit
quite
interesting
actually
flavour
has
some
bitterness
from
the
roast
but
more
sweetness
incredibly
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
pretty
similar
to
a
porter
or
a
stout
and
it
is
quite
nice
i
think
this
is
my
favourite
of
the
four
beers
from
the
brewery
d
it
would
definitely
drink
this
again
because
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
rather
unique
ebulum
is
a
drinkable
if
uninspiring
beer
worth
trying
once
this
ale
is
decent
at
best
but
its
still
how
they
used
to
make
it
so
for
that
i
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
drinkability
i
think
i
can
have
one
of
these
a
sittings
i
am
glad
i
bought
it
as
part
of
the
scottish
pack
at
the
lcbo
not
sure
i
would
hunt
down
again
as
a
must
need
it
has
a
decent
drinkability
with
light
crispness
light
sweetness
and
drinks
well
however
the
stickiness
and
dry
finish
dont
bide
well
together
and
get
a
little
weird
feeling
late
and
almost
gritty
this
beer
happened
to
suit
my
taste
but
i
would
recommend
this
as
an
unusual
venture
to
anyone
beercurious
whether
or
not
i
think
it
would
hit
home
with
them
d
i
really
like
the
taste
a
lot
but
it
is
extremely
dark
and
the
sweetness
could
easily
get
annoying
after
more
than
one
bottle
all
in
all
great
brew
from
them
a
favorite
along
with
the
heather
ale
and
the
midnight
sun
overall
i
dont
like
this
beer
but
its
a
personal
matter
my
wife
liked
it
it
was
kind
of
flat
and
watery
i
would
have
it
again
just
to
check
if
its
something
wrong
with
the
one
i
had
dhuge
malt
presence
the
sweetness
and
fruits
were
less
than
anticipated
not
quite
balanced
but
still
pretty
tasty
d
this
brew
is
a
very
flavoursome
american
stout
like
drop
that
is
very
impressive
drinkability
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
scottish
ales
pack
this
tastes
like
an
ok
dry
stout
with
some
additional
berries
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
would
rush
to
get
impressions
tasty
after
having
the
fraoch
and
grozet
on
different
occasions
ill
review
them
later
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
stout
lovers
should
definitely
try
this
i
ll
have
this
again
still
a
gentle
quaffing
ale
mild
but
interesting
a
very
nice
very
easy
to
appreciate
beer
could
easily
see
myself
sitting
down
to
several
of
these
this
beer
is
pleasant
for
sure
but
it
could
be
far
better
with
some
stronger
aroma
and
flavour
notes
an
enjoyable
little
brew
not
something
id
pick
up
too
often
but
certainly
well
worth
a
try
if
there
is
a
style
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
it
would
be
gruit
the
nose
on
this
is
that
of
chocolate
raisins
and
is
that
root
beer
the
alcohol
comes
through
on
the
nose
as
well
but
is
masked
pretty
well
in
mouthfeel
in
fact
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
flat
but
that
is
probably
due
to
the
small
amount
of
hops
used
in
this
the
flavor
is
sweet
the
dark
fruits
take
over
on
this
one
and
the
elderberry
is
very
subtle
all
in
all
interesting
style
but
probably
wont
be
reaching
for
this
one
again
drinkability
great
for
an
experience
not
an
everyday
beer
nor
am
i
sure
if
ill
try
again
still
glad
i
tried
it
though
this
one
isnt
bad
its
a
nice
departure
from
what
i
usually
drink
but
i
dont
think
its
an
everyday
thing
it
probably
would
have
been
better
before
the
date
on
the
bottle
maybe
next
time
as
usual
these
scottish
highlands
beers
give
the
beer
drinker
a
fun
journey
quite
pleasant
the
gloomy
sky
over
the
highlands
on
a
rainy
evening
now
sits
in
my
shaped
pint
glass
normally
id
agree
with
you
that
that
sounds
at
least
a
bit
negative
but
this
time
is
different
the
gloom
is
indeed
heavy
but
there
is
a
glimmer
of
clarity
some
vague
smoky
garnet
highlights
that
shine
through
with
the
suns
dying
rays
beneath
this
furtively
optimistic
sky
lies
a
meadow
engulfing
me
with
scents
of
tart
berries
rainsoaked
heather
fresh
raisins
and
sugared
figs
its
just
the
right
combination
of
serene
invitation
and
a
wild
admonition
like
the
rugged
highlands
themselves
or
so
i
hear
bobby
burns
can
be
pretty
persuasive
diving
in
those
berries
not
as
tart
as
they
initially
appeared
have
found
themselves
enveloped
by
heather
dark
wheat
and
tea
leaves
its
as
new
and
strange
to
my
tongue
as
attempting
to
mimic
the
accent
of
the
locals
again
if
youve
read
some
burns
youll
know
what
im
talking
about
similarly
in
this
vein
strange
though
it
may
be
its
not
altogether
bad
just
new
and
unusual
luckily
the
immense
weight
of
the
clouds
overhead
is
not
mirrored
in
this
brew
which
maintains
a
lightly
medium
weight
that
slides
nicely
along
like
that
babbling
brook
running
through
the
nearby
lea
like
the
craggy
highlands
this
is
an
acquired
taste
if
you
can
get
into
it
youll
love
it
and
if
not
well
lets
just
say
you
wont
be
attending
any
local
gaelic
games
any
time
soon
id
recommend
the
experience
though
notes
nice
beer
not
as
berry
flavored
as
the
name
could
make
you
believe
just
a
very
smooth
easy
going
beer
some
stout
flavors
but
no
real
roasted
bitterness
and
some
berry
flavors
but
not
really
sweet
or
tart
nice
beer
just
to
drink
a
couple
if
you
want
a
semisweet
beer
even
though
i
had
already
tried
the
heather
beer
i
took
a
shot
at
the
four
pack
sampler
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
elderberry
brew
black
with
brown
highlights
and
a
dense
mocha
head
somewhat
poor
retention
and
no
lace
mild
roasted
aroma
shows
coffee
and
cocoa
powder
paired
with
fruit
roastiness
takes
the
back
seat
when
it
comes
to
flavour
with
the
elderberries
planted
firmly
behind
the
proverbial
wheel
sharp
tangy
and
sweet
their
fruity
flavour
put
a
little
bit
of
something
interesting
into
an
otherwise
mediocre
beer
its
like
a
generic
macro
dark
ale
with
some
berry
flavour
thrown
in
light
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
feels
slight
but
not
thin
or
watery
easy
drinking
and
mildly
interesting
a
more
developed
roasted
malt
character
would
really
set
this
off
overall
overall
its
a
good
beer
nothing
about
it
wows
me
but
id
definitly
buy
another
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
berries
and
fruit
taste
is
also
of
berries
not
to
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
pretty
good
brew
pretty
good
beer
thats
not
very
exciting
on
the
palate
and
on
the
basic
side
regarding
taste
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
as
i
drank
this
beer
its
like
there
were
hints
of
lots
of
flavors
but
nothing
to
really
leave
a
huge
impression
it
fits
either
a
dark
ale
or
stout
category
while
it
was
quite
drinkable
and
the
flavor
improved
as
it
warmed
im
not
sure
that
this
would
be
my
first
choice
if
there
was
a
big
variety
at
a
bar
or
store
it
was
decent
enough
and
i
would
have
this
beer
again
but
it
would
not
be
one
that
i
sought
out
this
was
probably
great
fresh
drinkable
enough
without
having
a
huge
amount
of
character
it
has
some
uniqueness
which
i
appreciate
but
im
not
convinced
that
the
uniqueness
in
itself
is
enough
to
pull
it
out
of
mediocrity
it
tastes
a
little
bland
overall
well
done
id
love
some
more
of
this
i
could
definitely
get
into
trouble
with
these
d
delicious
and
very
drinkable
just
wish
it
was
less
expensive
an
authentic
archaic
ale
a
must
try
for
the
celtic
beer
lover
like
myself
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
highly
drinkable
without
a
doubt
the
best
beer
from
the
fourbeer
gift
pack
it
isnt
bad
it
just
isnt
good
totally
bland
and
apart
from
the
novelty
of
the
use
of
berries
for
flavour
unmemorable
its
an
interesting
variation
on
a
stout
and
yeah
not
bad
drinkability
this
stuff
is
great
why
dont
they
sell
it
in
sixers
final
thoughts
well
this
is
tied
for
the
worst
of
the
pack
but
despite
that
it
is
still
pretty
solid
stuff
all
in
all
decent
although
i
perhaps
sweeter
then
i
expect
from
a
darker
brew
all
in
all
after
trying
this
pack
i
heartily
support
bringing
gruit
back
and
would
not
hesitate
to
pickup
another
gruit
beer
again
overall
this
was
a
very
interesting
brew
i
cant
speak
as
to
how
it
compares
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
regardless
it
was
enjoyable
it
tasted
very
comparable
to
many
scotch
ales
hopefully
ill
get
to
have
a
few
more
gruits
to
give
it
something
to
stand
up
to
intriguing
beer
though
that
i
think
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
complex
mixture
of
flavors
wood
chocolate
roast
lots
of
roast
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
nice
sweetness
in
the
front
this
has
been
my
favorite
of
this
vertical
and
i
did
not
expect
that
it
is
almost
porterish
in
its
way
a
complicated
and
interesting
beer
drinkability
high
mouthfeel
average
an
interesting
if
not
revolutionary
ale
pours
unctions
black
with
a
slight
off
color
head
the
aroma
is
fresh
and
malty
with
a
peatlike
musky
smokiness
the
flavor
is
dark
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
fruit
blackberry
and
currant
and
distinct
peaty
smoke
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
leaving
a
smoky
finish
on
the
tongue
interesting
drinkable
but
perhaps
an
acquired
taste
i
really
like
the
idea
of
recovering
old
beer
styles
but
this
is
a
pretty
average
to
slightly
above
average
beer
a
little
bit
more
full
and
pronounced
in
the
taste
then
its
other
two
brothers
ive
already
had
but
dont
think
this
is
my
favourite
of
the
bunch
a
more
pronounced
presence
of
the
dark
fruits
would
have
made
this
beer
a
lot
nicer
3
down
and
1
to
go
in
the
craigmil
4pack
hppefully
the
last
will
fair
better
than
this
d
great
beer
a
beer
with
a
huge
history
and
that
still
stands
up
very
well
between
modern
day
brews
will
surely
drink
this
again
overall
very
surprising
beer
different
from
most
beers
i
had
before
i
love
it
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
one
doesnt
have
as
much
spice
or
odd
flavoring
that
other
beers
in
the
style
have
but
i
still
didnt
find
this
beer
to
be
very
good
if
this
truly
is
what
9th
century
scottish
ale
was
like
than
its
safe
to
say
the
druids
had
some
mighty
fine
taste
it
is
fun
to
be
able
to
try
ancient
style
ales
and
feel
as
though
as
youre
peering
back
into
time
or
being
enchanted
by
the
spirit
of
a
lost
people
and
their
culture
even
better
yet
is
when
that
beer
is
actually
awesome
in
its
own
right
drinkability
this
was
very
good
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
all
those
scottish
ales
have
been
very
good
especially
the
ancient
ones
d
one
seems
drinkable
enough
but
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
the
flavor
is
just
not
for
me
i
guess
d
while
not
a
terrible
beer
or
drain
pour
i
think
this
is
prolly
gonna
be
my
first
and
last
experience
with
this
one
drinkability
is
ok
this
beer
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
doubt
i
ever
drink
it
again
ebulum
is
a
barely
black
ale
with

has
a
splotchy
dense
light
brown
head
that
has
great
retention
and
leaves
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
very
strong
roasted
aroma
with
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
its
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
light

finish
thats
a
bit
acidic
it
tastes
quite
roasty
and
theres
a
sharp
green
bitterness
that
plays
off
that
well
its
mostly
a
coffee
flavor
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
a
dry
red
wine
flavor
at
the
finish
its
unique
and
tasty
d
fantastic
layered
ale
that
delivers
rich
dark
flavours
this
is
another
beer
that
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
again
finish

up
a

for

to
try
it
out
poured
into

glass
dark
cola
colored
body
no
carbonation
noticed
but
a
large
white
head
formed
thin
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
reminded
me
a
lot
of
dr
pepper
soda
with
a
certain
spiciness
to
it
taste
was
not
as
unusual
as
i
was
expecting
at
first
it
had
a
roasted
barley
flavor
to
it
like
a
porter
but
one
you
have
a
mouthful
you
can
really
taste
the
berry
flavor
goes
down
with
not
a
lot
of
aftertaste
somewhat
cough
syrup
like
coating
on
the
palate
at
the
end
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
though
on
the
light
side
for
a
6
5
beer
it
was
an
ok
beer
i
guess
that
i
was
just
hoping
for
more
than
i
got
in
terms
of
uniqueness
of
flavor
and
taste
drinkability
quite
good
if
i
could
find
a
sixpack
of
it
as
opposed
to
the
craigmill
variety
pack
i
would
certainly
buy
one
m
d
creamy
but
not
rich
full
but
not
thick
in
some
ways
those
statements
seem
intentionally
paradoxical
but
its
really
how
it
comes
across
its
robust
lets
put
it
that
way
big
enough
to
sip
at
and
enjoy
a
decent
beer
i
like
this
better
than
any
of
the
other
ye
olde
scottish
brews
for
the
simple
fact
that
it
is
much
more
like
a
real
beer
in
my
mind
but
i
cant
find
it
the
mouth
feel
is
well
carbonated
and
still
smooth
this
is
a
beer
that
could
also
be
aged
nicely
as
well
as
enjoyed
fresh
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
roasted
malts
although
everything
feels
a
touch
muted
and
a
touch
muddled
there
are
some
interesting
things
going
on
even
though
i
find
it
a
challenge
i
think
this
would
be
far
better
served
with
some
food
on
its
own
its
kinda
sharp
for
my
liking
pours
a
four
finger
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
a
good
lace
totally
black

slight

from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
drinkability
yes
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
consider
an
all
year
beer
the
flowery
fruity
sweetness
hints
of
summer
while
the
dark
black
ale
carries
us
through
winter
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
cosume
on
quantities
because
it
warrrants
taking
time
and
enjoying
but
it
is
easy
to
enjoy
pours
black
with
a
red
hue
when
help
up
to
light
thin
tan
head
just
a
bit
of
retention
and
good
lace
body
is
on
the
thicker
side
of
medium
with
some
carbonation
aroma
is
of
smokey
malts
and
coffee
taste
is
the
same
with
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
worth
a
try
but
i
liked
sam
adams
black
lager
better
this
is
a
cool
beer
that
reminds
me
of
an
english
style
old
ale
but
darker
it
pours
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
tan
line
probably
from
the
g
string
leaving
slow
long
lasting
lacing
maybe
the
tan
line
is
from
the
lacing
never
mind
anyway
the
nose
is
roasted
malts
with
a
musty
woodiness
the
flavor
is
a
nice
pretty
mild
bitterness
with
roasted
malt
tones
and
notes
of
blueberry
skin
on
the
finish
berry
flavor
develops
a
bit
as
it
opens
up
the
body
is
a
very
nice
medium
mouthfdeel
with
great
carbonation
very
cool
brew
take
your
time
with
this
one
this
is
not
a
beer
of
overthetop
flavors
or
aggressive
characteristics
instead
it
is
a
quiet
sipper
with
a
depth
of
complexity
to
please
even
the
most
jaded
of
beer
enthusiasts
overall
it
was
really
challenging
to
drink
as
i
couldnt
pinpoint
any
one
defining
characteristic
i
dont
think
that
i
would
reach
for
this
again
even
though
the
taste
was
thin
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
it
was
different
if
you
want
to
try
new
beers
then
definitely
try
this
one
youre
not
going
to
find
many
beers
with
elderberries
and
roasted
oats
in
them
one
bottle
will
do
it
for
me
but
at
least
it
was
fun
to
drink
conclusion
this
is
a
nice
brew
its
not
something
i
drink
all
the
time
but
rather
something
i
come
back
to
every
once
in
a
while
as
a
special
treat
kind
of
thing
the
elderberries
add
just
the
barest
kick
of
fruitiness
which
really
nicely
compliments
the
smoky
earthy
notes
overall
a
terrific
and
unique
ale
for
sure
the
spiciness
really
suited
itself
nicely
for
the
first
real
snowfall
of
the
oncoming
christmas
season
with
that
said
i
think
i
might
buy
a
couple
more
and
enjoy
them
fireside
next
to
the
christmas
tree
i
wish
the
body
had
a
little
more
traction
though
great
fresh
nose
and
overall
a
great
beer
dthe
burnt
and
roasty
notes
make
this
such
a
tasty
beer
but
not
very
easy
to
have
many
of
i
would
have
another
just
for
the
taste
but
it
would
probably
really
really
fill
me
up
i
picked
this
up
while
grabbing
a
couple
porters
schwarzbiers
listening
to
my
wifes
advice
the
11
2
oz
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
slight
beige
head
scotchcoffeeporter
aroma
the
head
dissipated
fairly
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
but
a
slight
banana
and
dark
berry
smell
soon
added
to
the
aromas
already
rich
smell
a
stoutlike
feel
to
the
mouth
although
not
to
the
guinness
level
the
flavor
definitely
fulfilled
the
aroma
with
a
scotch
porter
taste
with
tasty
earthiness
to
it
there
was
a
slightly
alcohol
aftertaste
but
not
overwhelming
definitely
a
fine
pour
for
my
mood
good
but
i
wouldnt
actively
go
and
seek
it
out
very
smooth
in
the
finish
soft
carbonation
and
full
bodied
the
texture
is
oily
and
thick
the
carbonation
is
probably
medium
to
low
and
very
smooth
fantastic
beer
id
love
to
have
this
with
red
meat
or
any
kind
of
savoury
dish
d
this
was
a
dangerously
drinkable
ale
with
a
serious
amount
of
alcohol
that
is
nearly
undetectable
the
sweetness
of
the
berry
flavors
made
this
one
more
of
a
dessert
beer
but
a
damn
good
one
at
that
i
was
facinated
when
i
first
read
about
gruit
and
have
been
anxious
to
try
a
really
good
version
just
thinking
about
drinking
something
that
was
passed
around
in
ancient
celebration
of
life
is
truly
an
enlightening
experience
4
m3
d
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
just
ultrasmooth
almost
the
smoothest
dark
beer
ive
ever
had
but
the
softness
on
top
of
a
mild
and
rather
simplistic
taste
of
this
black
ale
turns
against
itself
making
it
a
bit
boring
to
drink
pretty
soon
the
small
bottle
330ml
is
just
about
the
right
size
imo
it
drinks
like
a
schwarzbier
or
a
light
american
porter
sticky
on
the
lips
with
a
modest
carbonation
level
easy
enough
to
drink
but
id
prefer
a
porter
to
this
d
this
beer
suprised
me
the
earthy
notes
made
me
expect
a
belgian
dark
ale
but
the
taste
was
close
to
a
stout
with
a
lighter
mouthfeel
a
great
different
brew
thats
good
for
a
change
of
pace
not
quite
a
dessert
beer
but
certainly
not
a
session
beer
either
d
its
a
unique
beer
that
was
solid
but
not
spectacular
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
not
something
i
would
avoid
for
a
black
ale
i
swear
this
is
more
of
a
stout
still
very
delicious
and
the
use
of
elderberries
does
add
more
of
a
wellrounded
sweetness
to
it
overall
very
drinkable
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
drinkability
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
alright
it
would
be
a
sipper
at
best
i
guess
i
dont
like
elderberry
if
that
is
what
is
responsible
for
the
horrid
medicinalherbal
quality
of
this
brew
smooth
with
some
acidic
and
faintly
astringent
textures
moderate
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
like
a
light
porter
with
berries
there
may
be
something
to
these
elderberries
i
wish
i
had
a
long
curly
dirty
beard
braided
at
the
bottom
so
i
could
have
elderberry
ale
drippin
off
my
soaked
locks
these
barbarians
could
brew
impressive
beach
bum
head
with
a
black
abyss
of
a
body
smells
of
mocha
and
toffee
these
crazy
bastards
would
love
starbucks
crisp
with
a
character
reminiscent
of
a
robust
porter
and
a
slight
tart
similiar
too
a
rasberry
or
kiwi
the
palate
remains
smokey
yet
suprisingly
clean
with
no
nasty
medeival
off
flavors
if
i
cant
rock
the
helmet
with
horns
or
the
badass
facial
hair
i
can
only
hope
the
brewers
of
this
magnificent
ale
do
wonderfully
complex
interplay
of
flavors
a
little
red
wine
here
a
little
oatmeal
stout
there
not
too
bad
at
all
and
certainly
on
the
interesting
end
taste
is
roasted
with
molasses
and
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
the
spices
add
ginger
juniper
gagel
and
a
lot
of
other
spices
and
they
must
add
bitterness
because
i
taste
a
different
kind
of
bitterness
more
like
bitternut
or
something
not
the
kindest
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thin
and
aftertaste
is
lingering
bitter
and
roasted
drinkability
here
is
high
of
all
the
gruit
ive
had
this
is
some
of
the
best
for
sessions
and
hot
summer
days
as
when
its
cold
it
leaves
you
feeling
refreshed
this
was
a
very
unique
beer
it
reminded
me
of
a
hybrid
between
a
sweet
stout
and
a
red
wine
it
was
definitely
quite
different
from
any
beer
gruits
or
otherwise
i
have
ever
sampled
got
this
in
a
historic
brews
of
scotland
mix
pack
poured
it
chilled
in
my
samuel
adams
pint
glass
yay
free
glassware
looks
straight
up
black
as
an
eclipse
with
a
minute
black
cherry
color
when
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
smell
is
very
pleasent
elderberries
dominate
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
a
whiff
of
roasted
coffee
taste
much
like
a
good
porter
with
brewed
coffee
in
the
front
but
stinging
on
the
tonuge
and
a
finish
that
lasts
forever
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
pours
up
black
as
night
brown
tinted
head
with
moderate
retention
aroma
of
fruit
i
guess
its
the
elderberry
and
roasted
malt
tastes
of
roasted
malts
dark
fruit
brandy
light
bodied
low
carbo
dry
malt
with
sweet
fruit
finish
scotland
the
brave
very
nice
fruit
and
floral
notes
wellbalanced
and
satisfyling
drinkability
not
very
common
beer
in
the
scottish
gruit
style
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
whats
not
to
like
a
fruity
smooth
stout
with
the
aroma
of
its
roasted
barley
good
stout
like
thickness
no
coffee
good
complexity
mild
acidicty
in
the
finish
and
elderberries
are
as
healthy
as
wine
because
they
are
blue
seriously
oh
and
chocolate
too
murky
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
tiny
cask
head
aromas
of
distant
nail
polish
and
pretzels
at
the
mall
i
found
that
rather
intriguing
the
flavor
was
similar
with
some
tartness
thrown
in
someone
at
the
bar
said
horse
blanket
i
tasted
horse
blanket
medium
body
and
a
slightly
sour
finish
the
night
it
was
on
cask
i
had
just
missed
one
of
the
main
guys
from
the
brewery
who
was
there
to
meet
and
greet
they
said
he
was
cool
then
i
found
out
there
was
a
halfempty
cask
now
fully
up
to
room
temperature
of
bells
porter
in
the
back
that
had
been
taken
off
the
beer
engine
to
make
way
for
this
new
beer
under
current
review
which
was
not
in
the
cellar
temp
cooler
long
enough
to
be
any
cooler
than
tepid
then
i
got
mad
the
bartender
said
not
a
lot
of
people
even
showed
up
for
this
event
either
great
d
a
very
nice
beer
roasty
chocolate
and
berries
work
well
together
an
interesting
complex
beer
without
being
overpowering
a
bit
dry
in
the
mouth
but
it
works
overall
quite
tasty
d
it
was
very
smooth
and
refreshing
the
balance
of
spices
and
malts
was
pleasing
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
style
and
i
will
be
back
for
additional
brews
great
ale
hope
to
find
it
again
overall
not
bad
id
get
this
one
again
drinkability
interesting
and
certainly
fine
enough
for
a
single
bottle
but
not
something
id
want
to
make
a
habit
of
bottle
from
the
lcbo
which
was
packaged
with
three
other
beers
from
the
brewery
pours
very
dark
with
a
small
tan
head
its
appearance
reminded
me
of
a
stout
and
when
i
held
it
up
to
the
light
i
couldnt
see
through
and
felt
like
i
was
regarding
the
darkness
of
my
own
soul
aroma
is
fruity
and
reminded
me
somewhat
of
an
abbey
ale
this
beer
is
thick
on
the
palate
and
in
wine
terminology
it
has
long
legs
the
predominant
flavour
was
a
dark
fruity
sweetness
which
conjured
up
images
of
dates
i
couldnt
100
place
it
and
i
suppose
i
should
go
out
and
taste
an
elderberry
a
tasty
brew
but
not
as
satisfying
as
the
alba
this
beer
is
definatly
different
from
anything
ive
had
before
mostly
dark
flavors
but
also
has
fruity
berry
flavors
as
well
not
an
instant
favorite
but
id
definatly
buy
it
again
so
far
ive
been
impressed
w
every
ale
that
ive
tried
by
this
brewery
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
nose
is
licorice
berry
and
earthy
flavor
is
smooth
and
with
much
depth
hearty
like
a
stout
with
roasted
qualities
but
just
a
bit
of
hearty
berry
edge
feel
is
thick
with
character
but
with
a
lower
carbonation
drinkable
this
is
one
brewery
that
i
want
to
try
everything
they
put
out
unique
well
balanced
and
worth
the
time
money
and
pleasure
id
drink
it
again
but
would
probably
pair
with
some
food
i
thought
the
taste
itself
was
really
overbearing
sometimes
tasty
but
by
itself
can
be
too
much
d
quite
drinkable
in
fact
this
may
be
the
most
drinkable
historic
beer
that
i
have
had
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
black
lager
except
for
the
coffee
notes
with
a
nice
subtle
fruitiness
the
elderberries
really
add
character
to
this
beer
and
rise
above
the
level
of
the
gimmick
i
feared
they
might
be
tastes
of
sweet
toasted
malt
sour
fruits
molasses
and
some
chocolate
pours
a
nice
head
that
quickly
falls
thin
and
doesnt
disappear
the
lacing
is
very
good
sticks
great
the
color
is
black
and
unseethrough
able
smell
is
dark
roasted
and
a
little
earthy
like
a
black
ale
with
some
mossy
smells
to
it
there
are
some
chocolate
notes
as
well
taste
is
slightly
roasty
with
those
mossy
flavors
and
some
offflavors
almost
rubberylike
flavors
good
mouthfeel
very
pillowy
overall
i
wouldnt
have
another
one
of
these
unless
i
was
in
scotland
i
can
never
know
when
these
gruits
are
still
good
overall
a
very
different
kind
of
beer
not
really
my
bag
but
very
redeeming
as
a
change
of
pace
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
complex
than
i
was
expecting
with
the
burnt
malts
interacting
well
with
the
barley
and
oats
and
what
i
assume
is
the
elderberry
a
nice
tartness
and
a
subtle
red
wine
flavor
rounded
out
the
beer
nicely
it
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
schwartzbier
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
well
carbonated
this
is
a
really
unique
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
seems
a
little
watery
to
me
moderate
carbonation
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
ever
but
its
certainly
interesting
this
beer
is
a
complex
melange
of
sorts
youll
start
out
with
a
very
dark
almost
porter
like
color
with
very
little
head
and
only
minimal
lacing
the
beer
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
the
smell
is
sweet
molasses
charred
wood
blackberry
maybe
some
cocoa
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
where
the
complexity
really
shines
it
begins
with
a
sweetish
maltiness
a
bit
like
caramel
berry
and
tangy
citrus
the
mid
section
segues
into
a
more
semisweet
chocolate
almond
configuration
and
ends
with
more
of
the
burnt
wood
smoky
peat
and
warming
alcohol
notes
flavor
the
mouthfeel
leaves
a
bit
of
a
film
on
the
tongue
perhaps
from
the
residual
berry
the
aftertaste
is
moderate
and
brings
out
the
warming
alcohol
notes
drinkability
thats
a
question
mark
and
it
really
depends
upon
the
season
and
the
dish
that
one
is
eating
standing
alone
this
is
a
beer
i
wouldnt
contemplate
having
more
than
one
but
coupled
with
an
entree
there
are
more
possibilities
i
would
be
open
to
this
beer
is
characteristic
of
the
scotch
ale
style
and
would
complement
heavier
pub
fare
this
beer
is
truly
complex
and
for
that
alone
well
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
d
tasty
brew
lacks
some
carbonation
which
would
have
made
it
a
bit
nicer
in
my
book
flavors
are
good
but
a
tad
cloying
after
a
bit
this
wonderful
black
ale
pours
out
dark
with
a
wonderful
tan
head
giving
it
a
very
porterlike
appearance
it
has
wonderful
maltyoakysmoked
peat
scents
with
no
one
dominating
smell
but
rather
a
nice
mixture
of
them
all
this
beer
goes
down
smoothly
and
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
quite
a
few
at
one
setting
it
has
a
nice
dark
oaky
flavor
with
a
hint
of
smoke
and
a
tiny
hint
of
elderberry
in
it
a
wonderful
dark
ale
to
try
330
ml
bottle
at
haket
göteborg
black
colour
moderate
but
lasting
creamy
head
strong
aroma
of
roast
malts
chocolate
and
elderberries
flavour
is
mellow
and
rounded
with
chocolate
and
elderberries
surprisingly
well
balanced
now
also
available
in
norway
at
cardinal
pub
stavanger
good
beer
smooth
and
drinkable
but
kinda
boring
drinkability
very
drinkable
while
the
berry
flavour
is
noticeable
its
not
overpowering
and
the
base
beer
is
quite
well
done
drinkability
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
like
a
beer
with
berries
so
prominent
in
the
name
to
have
a
more
fruity
flavor
but
that
may
just
be
what
you
get
with
elderberries
though
the
beer
lacks
anything
to
make
it
stand
out
in
any
department
it
is
good
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
but
still
good
medium
bodied
substantial
yet
refreshing
this
is
really
a
brilliant
drink
12oz
bottle
from
rons
in
farmington
rather
opaque
blackred
body
with
a
very
thin
light
tan
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
nuttiness
and
fruitiness
with
a
firm
bit
of
roastiness
in
the
background
tastes
like
berries
and
chocolate
more
than
anything
a
slight
nuttiness
is
in
the
background
as
well
as
a
smoky
quality
lots
of
stuff
in
this
flavor
medium
body
a
tasty
complex
beer
thats
for
sure
not
sure
id
ever
be
drawn
to
this
one
again
but
definitely
a
very
tasty
solid
ale
d
i
bought
this
beer
on
a
complete
whim
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
say
the
least
this
beer
isnt
just
a
weak
ale
with
common
berries
added
like
most
fruit
beers
on
the
market
instead
its
a
rich
black
ale
much
like
a
schwartzbier
with
elderberries
added
this
leads
to
a
much
more
complex
character
and
keeps
the
fruitiness
completely
in
check
im
glad
i
found
this
one
looking
forward
to
having
one
or
two
of
these
again
on
a
cool
evening
as
summer
winds
into
fall
this
beers
perfect
weather
overall
another
off
the
wall
beer
one
i
suppose
is
good
for
broadening
ones
historical
perspective
of
beer
but
a
curiosity
nonetheless
worth
a
try
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
fairly
one
dimensional
some
how
the
berry
note
is
nice
but
is
too
dominant
the
beer
is
also
a
bit
too
thin
and
the
roast
character
only
adds
some
acidity
and
astringency
in
the
finish
if
the
base
beer
was
more
flavorful
i
think
this
would
actually
work
as
it
is
this
beer
is
a
touch
boring
though
certainly
not
undrinkable
d
a
pleasant
dark
ale
w
sweet
berry
and
roasted
malts
whats
not
to
like
i
would
consider
this
a
good
aperitif
but
it
would
pair
well
with
cheese
or
lighter
fare
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
saltiness
and
a
strong
berry
overtone
perhaps
elderberry
im
not
sure
what
elderberries
actually
smell
like
pours
a
rich
deep
opaque
sable
with
a
thick
tan
head
flavor
is
stouty
and
has
a
nice
bitter
edge
with
fruityberry
hints
it
feels
thicker
than
most
ales
although
not
quite
as
thick
as
a
fine
stout
or
porter
and
is
very
smooth
truly
unique
ancient
ale
far
superior
to
the
fraoch
heather
ale
well
worth
the
3
25
for
11
2
oz
bottle
would
still
prefer
a
pint
size
bottle
notes
ehhhh
not
for
me
overall
recommended
was
interesting
but
lacks
the
complexity
needed
to
get
me
to
buy
another
bottle
pleasant
peculiar
absolutely
to
taste
again
t
there
is
an
earthy
coffee
taste
and
then
a
more
sweet
fruit
taste
as
well
very
layered
and
interesting
and
yet
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
too
i
have
no
idea
what
elderberry
tastes
like
so
im
not
sure
if
i
can
pick
it
up
however
with
a
nice
medium
mouth
feel
and
a
good
swish
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
great
beer
thats
very
enjoyable
to
drink
drinkability
very
nice
this
is
the
second
ale
imported
from
scotland
that
i
have
tried
first
was
belhavens
scottish
ale
and
i
have
to
say
that
the
scots
have
brewing
down
to
an
art
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
from
scotland
d
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
its
complex
flavors
allow
for
a
truly
pleasurable
experience
it
goes
down
fairly
well
and
theres
very
little
i
can
complain
about
pours
pitch
black
with
a
foamy
bubbly
brown
head
that
thins
out
quick
but
keeps
a
hearty
ring
of
big
bubbles
alive
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
not
much
lace
to
speak
of
the
bouquet
is
well
fruity
so
this
is
what
elderberries
smell
like
interesting
i
like
this
ive
never
smelled
a
beer
like
this
before
which
makes
sense
not
having
had
an
elderberry
beer
before
very
pleasant
aroma
i
get
some
raisin
and
plum
scents
here
too
as
well
as
some
apple
scent
the
taste
is
strange
its
really
thin
up
front
but
after
it
sits
in
the
mouth
and
warms
up
a
bit
there
is
a
noticeable
change
in
composure
perhaps
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
brewed
qualities
of
the
elderberry
but
the
flavor
is
very
muted
almost
nonexistent
at
first
then
after
a
second
or
two
the
fruit
flavors
present
themselves
and
the
whole
thing
livens
up
a
bit
finishes
fruity
and
tart
with
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
and
then
after
you
think
its
all
over
it
actually
gives
off
a
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
its
subtle
at
first
but
the
flavors
here
are
much
more
complex
than
you
think
in
the
beginning
i
am
surprisingly
impressed
by
this
beer
for
a
number
of
reasons
if
you
try
this
be
sure
to
let
it
sit
a
bit
and
warm
up
to
really
give
the
flavors
a
chance
to
make
their
presence
known
not
exactly
what
i
would
call
a
session
beer
but
one
that
i
would
definitely
try
again
would
go
very
well
with
certain
berrycentric
desserts
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
between
the
sweetness
alcohol
and
light
bitterness
wow
i
really
like
this
beer
this
brewery
keeps
pushing
the
edge
with
interesting
and
nearly
forgotten
recipes
and
it
continues
to
impress
me
give
me
a
fridge
full
of
this
stuff
solid
brew
pours
a
clear
black
with
a
light
tan
head
that
laces
very
well
aroma
fruit
esters
and
probably
elderberries
as
i
dont
know
what
they
smell
like
taste
was
stoutish
with
roasted
malt
burnt
toast
and
a
long
dry
finish
didnt
notice
much
berriness
to
it
though
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
had
this
in
a
gift
set
including
alba
fraoch
and
grozet
and
this
one
was
definitely
my
favourite
drinkability
mellow
tones
with
an
interesting
panoply
of
flavors
make
this
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewery
this
beer
poured
black
with
a
hint
of
red
the
red
being
most
noticeable
at
the
edges
where
more
light
could
filter
through
any
head
quickly
disappeared
to
leave
a
hint
of
lace
at
the
edges
the
nose
was
malty
sweet
with
a
hint
of
berry
and
some
smoky
notes
at
the
end
smooth
mouth
with
a
hint
of
after
taste
and
very
little
carbonation
i
tried
it
wont
drink
it
again
but
i
do
not
like
dark
beers
12
oz

color
of
brownish
purple
with

departing
head
nose
of

cocoa

body
medium
and
creamy

aftertaste
of
malts
chocolate
with
hint
of
jammy
red
wine
zin
this
was
a
great
brew
the
ale
poured
a
deep
dark
mahogany
with
great
lacing
and
a
thick
dark
head
fruity
hoppy
aromas
gave
way
to
a
perfectly
balanced
flavor
profile
slight
berry
sweetness
with
an
aggressive
bitterness
which
lasts
to
the
end
slight
earthy
and
cherry
notes
enhance
the
beer
as
it
warms
very
well
crafted
refreshing
beer
i
found
this
one
and
knew
i
had
to
try
it
it
poirs
and
very
darkih
red
with
a
dense
tan
head
that
reduces
down
into
a
good
lacing
and
a
crown
the
smell
is
rich
and
warm
with
sweet
berry
accents
the
taste
is
rich
with
chocolate
and
berries
flavors
and
it
finishes
a
bit
tart
it
goes
down
smooth
too
a
very
good
herbed
ale
and
very
enjoyable
this
is
an
unusual
drink
and
good
for
what
it
is
this
is
the
fourth
of
a
fourpack
series
i
bought
and
it
is
my
favorite
not
something
i
would
want
with
any
regularilty
but
a
nice
something
different
rare
treat
overall
the
aromatics
of
the
elderberries
are
there
but
subtle
overtaken
by
the
rich
nature
of
the
darker
malts
satisfying
interesting
and
personally
prefered
to
their
spruce
beer
profile
imagine
a
rich
coffee
stout
infused
with
wild
botanicals
and
musty
berry
fruit
and
you
will
nail
this
dark
elixer
finish
is
wet
and
long
and
infused
with
the
stoutfruit
tastes
but
slightly
bittering
from
the
hops
very
nice
dark
ale
more
like
a
fruit
and
herb
flavored
thick
porter
or
stout
pours
a
very
dark
redblack
thick
tan
head
forms
settles
to
a
layer
and
ring
with
nice
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
roasty
smells
like
a
stout
with
a
nice
smooth
berry
aroma
coffee
and
chocolate
roasty
chocolate
in
the
front
sour
berries
in
the
middle
chocolate
and
berries
in
the
finish
really
neat
real
tartness
down
the
throat
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
very
creamy
and
smooth
i
really
enjoyed
this
hopefully
good
things
to
come
from
this
set
of
beers
definately
interested
in
trying
more
old
school
scottish
ales
really
quite
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
id
pick
up
a
six
pack
brew
pours
to
a
dark
brown
if
not
black
color
and
does
not
seem
to
let
much
of
any
light
through
has
a
nice
medium
tan
colored
head
that
has
some
retention
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
brew
the
aroma
has
a
lot
going
on
coffee
fruit
berries
and
a
wine
like
scent
seem
to
be
very
noticeable
notice
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
from
the
onset
from
the
nice
roastedburnt
malt
in
the
middle
i
notice
some
fruitberry
flavors
coming
through
a
very
nice
tasting
brew
also
has
a
somewhat
dry
finish
to
it
overall
i
like
this
brew
reminds
me
of
a
porter
but
what
do
i
know
i
would
get
this
one
again
body
is
medium
creamy
and
very
slippery
smooth
the
oats
add
a
nice
fullness
and
the
carbonation
is
very
gentle
and
soft
much
better
than
their
grozet
pours
dark
brownback
not
too
viscous
modest
head
yet
nice
collar
and
some
lacing
has
a
slight
sour
smell
on
the
nose
but
with
obvious
chocolate
and
roast
given
their
other
beers
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
one
starts
out
soft
with
some
chocolate
roast
and
a
little
tartness
elderberries
tartness
is
coupled
with
the
bitterness
from
the
dark
roast
and
melds
well
drying
off
into
the
finish
nice
flavor
but
relatively
simple
this
has
a
certain
similarity
with
their
other
beers
common
yeast
maybe
medium
medium
light
mouthfeel
with
soft
carbonation
it
is
fairly
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
pack
so
far
only
the
alba
remains
id
buy
this
again
if
it
was
available
on
its
own
i
did
think
the
elderberry
would
be
more
prominent
though
extremely
dry
beer
as
it
hits
the
back
of
the
both
with
a
strong
body
to
it
that
hits
with
sherry
notes
fruity
and
spicy
dark
black
in
color
i
often
have
a
hard
time
getting
back
to
beers
that
i
likealways
distracted
by
the
new
beer
to
dry
but
this
is
one
that
i
often
pick
up
a
bottle
of
when
out
shopping
to
have
again
and
again
very
good
beer
and
it
warms
up
very
well
not
like
an
old
ale
but
ok
so
you
can
sip
it
for
a
while
it
had
a
large
frothy
sand
coloured
head
that
actually
stuck
around
for
a
while
reminded
me
of
100s
of
porters
and
stouts
i
have
had
throughout
my
life
smell
is
semisweet
chocolate
coffee
and
plenty
of
roasted
malt
if
you
are
looking
for
it
there
is
a
slight
presence
of
berries
hidden
deep
deep
down
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
plenty
of
coffee
beanlike
bitterness
following
the
initial
malty
sweetness
this
is
quite
good
and
lovely
surprise
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
and
gently
with
a
medium
weight
body
i
feel
i
could
drink
3
or
4
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
certainly
feel
it
would
accompany
a
meal
well
ill
certainly
buy
this
again
cant
taste
the
elderberry
and
the
entire
beer
is
a
bit
too
weak
for
my
taste
a
nice
offering
easy
enough
to
drink
and
unusual
in
its
taste
surprisingly
good
fruit
flavored
stout
well
worth
a
try
flavor
is
complex
and
enjoyable
a
good
one
to
try
aroma
is
mostly
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
elderberries
in
the
background
with
the
taste
being
very
much
the
same
mostly
coffee
up
front
followed
by
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
a
hint
of
fruit
the
elderberries
become
more
pronouced
in
the
finish
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
mouth
nice
dark
roasty
flavors
comingle
with
the
rich
flavors
of
the
elderberries
unfortunately
the
first
flavors
are
the
best
from
there
we
go
to
a
weak
showing
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
with
almost
no
bitter
balance
and
a
slightly
plastic
very
undesirable
finishing
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
horrible
its
like
a
cask
ale
except
thinner
theres
absolutely
no
carbonation
aside
from
a
tine
twinge
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
this
is
pretty
tasty
its
too
bad
i
only
have
one
this
beer
poured
a
rich
black
that
was
intriguingly
flat
with
little
head
the
aroma
was
of
dark
fruit
almost
wine
like
the
taste
was
surprisingly
light
with
a
good
dose
of
bittered
fruit
the
feel
was
heavy
and
very
dry
i
purchased
this
beer
because
i
wanted
something
different
and
this
fit
the
bill
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
the
winelike
qualities
were
nice
while
i
doubt
ill
ever
by
a
six
im
sure
ill
pick
up
the
occaisional
single
enjoyable
and
nicely
drinkable
i
have
a
great
appreciation
for
experimental
and
challenging
brews
though
this
one
falls
a
little
unsettled
a
medium
viscous
black
hue
with
light
head
retention
and
fair
lacing
smells
quite
schwarzbierlike
with
a
soft
powdered
sugar
sweetness
stong
with
the
berries
raspberries
and
blueberries
in
the
flavor
and
lightly
in
the
aroma
turns
to
vineous
or
winelike
midway
through
the
drink
with
a
grapelike
flavor
and
sweetness
in
the
finish
a
moderate
alcohol
feel
and
flavor
shows
in
the
finish
as
well
good
but
off
on
the
toasted
quality
and
underlying
sweetness
lacks
boldness
for
such
character
a
nice
beer
to
have
a
lot
of
if
you
want
a
dinkable
fruit
beer
with
nice
malts
ill
probably
have
this
again
sometime
the
berries
are
mostly
in
the
smell
of
this
beer
overall
a
very
earthy
beverage
that
leaves
a
sour
taste
on
the
tongue
more
complex
and
malty
than
i
expected
and
well
worth
a
try
poured
a
virtually
black
color
with
attractive
tannish
head
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
the
head
very
slowly
fell
to
a
thick
ring
smell
is
porterllike
with
nice
toasted
notes
chocolate
and
coffee
undertines
and
a
bit
of
fruitiness
elderberry
taste
shows
miuch
more
of
the
fruitiness
and
forces
the
toasted
and
coffee
tastes
to
the
background
some
alcohol
presence
is
also
noted
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
combines
with
a
mild
bitterness
at
the
finish
to
create
a
very
enjoyable
beer
very
easy
to
drink
would
be
an
excellent
afterdinner
drink
this
came
from
a
4
beer
variety
pack
it
pours
very
very
dark
if
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
there
is
no
change
very
little
head
that
fades
quickly
faint
aroma
with
an
almost
sweet
red
wine
smell
mouthfeel
is
fair
but
the
flavor
is
pretty
weak
i
would
call
this
an
interesting
novelty
beer
but
must
admit
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
the
elderberry
highly
recommended
hoping
this
is
available
outside
of
christmas
gift
packs
as
id
definitely
like
to
have
some
in
stock
thanks
to
christy
and
vincent
purveyors
of
tasty
delights
poured
dark
brown
small
tan
head
aroma
dark
berries
and
molasses
alcohol
dark
brown
sugar
and
hints
of
coffee
i
hop
the
flavor
is
as
good
as
the
aroma
flavor
sorry
to
say
but
no
weak
strange
as
i
tasted
this
i
kept
getting
differant
flavors
with
each
sip
st
sip
was
molasses
2nd
the
berries
came
out
3rd
malts
and
honey
than
it
started
over
it
wasnt
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
not
a
bad
beer
d
i
cant
forsee
this
one
matching
with
foods
well
sessionable
not
likely
it
is
too
strong
anyway
i
dont
think
ill
partake
in
this
one
again
the
fruit
presence
is
subdued
this
is
more
like
a
porter
than
anything
a
not
so
good
porter
at
that
it
poured
with
a
very
thin
layer
of
head
even
though
i
poured
fairly
vigorously
that
was
probably
the
only
disappointing
part
about
this
experience
the
color
is
very
close
to
pitch
black
and
is
certainly
opaque
the
nose
is
a
highlight
maltybrandychocolate
lends
ideas
that
this
may
be
a
treat
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
robust
expected
from
the
look
of
it
there
are
mostly
chocolate
and
toffee
notes
throughout
with
underlying
tones
of
elderberry
of
course
but
they
act
as
a
good
compliment
and
as
a
character
developer
the
finish
is
a
little
more
roasty
with
a
winelike
dryness
its
surprising
how
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
idiosyncratic
beer
that
im
guessing
gives
us
a
glimpse
into
the
past
future
of
home
brew
seek
it
out
quite
good
pours
a
dark
garnet
with
a
shortlived
one
finger
head
in
a
pokal
settled
down
slowly
to
a
thin
collar
good
lacing
in
the
wake
aroma
of
berries
was
prominent
as
brew
warmed
later
malt
and
alcohol
surfaced
i
was
prepared
for
sweet
blueberry
pancake
syrup
but
was
pleasantly
suprised
with
a
dryish
complex
brew
there
was
some
a
hint
of
berries
maltiness
some
dark
chocolate
black
coffee
and
chicory
or
field
greens
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
with
a
rather
dry
finish
a
mostly
satisfying
brew
pours
near
black
with
decent
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
chocolately
with
a
subtle
berry
scent
buried
in
back
the
taste
did
not
contain
as
much
elderberry
flavor
as
i
thought
it
would
the
flavor
of
this
ale
is
made
mainly
of
chocolate
malts
and
coffee
flavors
the
elderberry
flavor
much
like
the
elderberry
aroma
is
buried
in
the
back
and
is
not
that
noticeable
this
is
a
pretty
good
ale
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
second
round
of
d
great
pours
dark
blackbrown
with
amber
highlights
the
head
is
dark
tan
and
the
nose
is
old
dried
fruit
and
malt
i
loved
the
full
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
with
all
its
jammy
notes
combined
with
a
big
malt
backbone
almost
a
rougher
relation
to
traquairs
jacobite
ale
very
tasty
and
unique
a
really
interesting
beer
almost
flanders
red
like
with
the
fruitiness
and
tartness
overall
bears
a
great
deal
of
similarities
to
a
milk
stout
but
enough
differences
to
stand
on
its
own
feet
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
one
started
out
great
and
really
hit
a
wall
with
the
taste
i
will
not
be
buying
this
again
not
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
a
porter
but
a
little
sweeter
and
not
as
offensive
if
you
like
porters
its
worth
a
try
i
suppose
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
would
probably
seek
out
defiantly
a
departure
from
the
beers
ive
tasted
lately
wont
be
looking
for
this
anytime
soon
palate
rich
bitter
licorice
coffee
smoke
notes
pervade
dry
but
mouthfilling
clean
the
berry
flavors
are
there
but
restrained
this
is
anything
but
a
foofoo
fruit
beer
it
is
chewy
and
smokey
the
bitterness
is
wonderfully
satisfying
black
ale
man
they
wernt
kidding
this
puppy
is
black
with
a
slight
18
head
on
top
average
aromasome
malt
and
a
slight
metalic
note
to
it
big
malty
flavorslight
bitterness
doesnt
have
that
underlying
caramel
sweetness
you
get
in
scottish
ales
the
elderberries
are
there
but
in
a
muted
presence
they
come
thru
more
in
the
after
taste
nice
body
overall
a
very
well
balanced
beer
it
has
a
great
inky
blackness
to
it
and
the
fruit
rounds
out
the
whole
thing
would
love
to
have
this
on
draft
didnt
know
what
to
expect
when
i
saw
this
but
figured
it
was
worth
a
try
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
most
scottish
beers
ive
had
the
berry
comes
through
in
the
aftertaste
very
dark
in
appearance
good
balance
easy
to
drink
a
unique
beer
suited
well
for
desert
i
cant
think
of
another
beer
to
compare
it
with
maybe
a
scottish
three
philosophers
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
purplish
brown
in
color
with
very
little
head
aroma
is
very
slight
with
hard
to
distinguish
anything
at
all
maybe
smells
like
a
brown
ale
or
some
caramel
dark
roasty
hints
barely
detectable
sip
reveals
mostly
a
taste
of
a
black
ale
with
no
fruit
dark
coffee
notes
almost
like
a
watered
down
stout
pours
like
a
stout
black
with
a
coffeecolored
head
smells
like
dark
cherry
and
old
coffee
taste
is
quite
complex
dark
fruits
stoutlike
bitter
malts
and
a
medicinal
tart
berry
with
a
prominant
coffee
ground
aftertaste
it
was
hard
to
pick
everything
out
i
would
have
given
a
higher
taste
score
if
the
flavors
meshed
a
little
better
but
still
enough
to
keep
me
interested
really
reminded
me
of
a
sweet
stout
says
its
a
black
ale
on
the
bottle
so
thats
kind
of
vague
mouthfeel
was
smooth
a
little
undercarbonated
for
my
liking
but
alright
i
dont
know
if
id
want
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
but
it
was
a
good
beer
kept
me
interested
throughout
and
certainly
worth
a
try
poured
out
to
a
coffee
like
black
color
with
a
minimal
head
and
some
lacing
low
to
very
low
carbonation
scents
of
berries
and
roased
herbs
were
noted
albeit
theyn
were
very
light
flavor
was
smooth
and
medium
bodies
with
flavors
of
cooked
oats
dark
berries
and
grassy
earth
toward
the
end
decent
mouthfeel
rather
soft
and
creamy
not
a
bad
beer
definitly
a
night
brew
for
after
dinner
or
dessert
dark
brown
beer
with
a
light
brown
head
looks
like
a
porter
foam
eventually
reduces
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
roasted
and
chocolate
maltiness
with
a
fruity
berry
aroma
more
of
the
same
in
the
flavour
but
the
berry
character
is
more
pronounced
and
the
malt
character
is
more
mild
finishes
with
a
dry
roasted
bitter
twang
slick
mouthfeel
mediumlight

carbonation
on
the

a
nice
mix

quite
enjoyable
another
historical
ale
from
brewery
craigmill
this
style
was
supposedly
brought
to
scotland
by
welsh
druids
according
to
the
label
appearance
is
a
deep
purple
almost
black
body
that
shines
a
clear
radiant
ruby
hue
when
held
to
a
strong
light
small
beige
head
quickly
dissipates
leaving
no

is
subdued
with
dark
roasted
grain
notes
and
a
hint
of
berry
light
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
in
the
mouth
taste
has
a
mildly
bitter
coffee
note
porter
like
in
nature
and
a
softness
from
the
oats
mild
berry
presence
could
be
a
bit
more
assertive
in
this
one
but
the
taste
is
well
balanced
and
pleasant
to
sip
i
wouldnt
mind
having
two
or
three
of
these
at
a
sitting
pours
a
dark
porter
with
reddish
tint
and
no
head
and
slight
filmy
lace
smell
is
nice
like
roasted
malt
coffee
and
sweet
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
much
a
dark
ale
with
characteristics
of
malt
and
coffee
on
the
front
dried
fig
middle
and
clean
fruit
finish
wellbalanced
low
carbonation
leads
to
little
to
no
head
and
thin
cereal
on
the
tongue
with
slight
hop
tingle
on
the
finish
nice
sipping
beer
but
balanced
enough
for
more
than
one
drinkability
hey
its
not
for
me
maybe
you
like
elderberries
or
venison
it
does
have
a
cool
medieval
bottle
pours
dark
red
almost
black
almost
no
head
at
all
gets
me
thinking
this
doesnt
look
too
far
from
a
very
dark
wine
vinous
berry
and
woody
nose
with
noticeable
malt
and
subtle
smokiness
the
sweet
berrries
come
in
early
and
move
into
slight
acidity
as
the
flavor
progresses
im
enjoying
the
roasted
grain
and
smoke
flavors
as
they
coalesce
with
the
vinous
berries
a
little
chocolate
is
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
the
flavor
is
big
and
i
think
that
sounds
appropriate
for
what
this
beer
is
shooting
for
finish
is
a
little
dry
and
composed
mainly
of
roasted
grain
with
a
bit
of
acidity
long
chocolately
roasted
aftertaste
i
thoroughly
enjoy
these
ancient
beer
styles
from
brewery
craigmill
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
hell
of
a
specialty
beer
and
way
drinkable
to
boot
wow
thats
refreshing
i
am
very
pleasantly
surprised
mediumheavy
bodied
very
wet
mouthfeel
great
condition
you
get
a
grand
tour
of
what
an
ale
can
be
like
imagine
every
great
flavor
youve
ever
had
in
an
ale
rolling
across
your
tongue
with
elderberries
and
there
you
have
it
this
is
a
different
kind
of
beer
but
definately
in
a
good
way
it
pours
very
darkblack
with
a
dark
brown
head
the
head
on
mine
didnt
last
all
that
long
the
taste
was
sweet
and
malty
with
a
nice
blend
of
dark
fruit
it
has
a
light
bitterness
to
it
as
well
good
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
its
out
of
the
ordinary
which
is
always
refreshing
i
recommend
trying
this
brew
for
sure
bottle
poured
a
pitchblack
color
ale
with
a
dark
foamy
head
with
average
retention
i
can
only
describe
the
aroma
as
a
strange
mix
between
roasted
malt
and
semisweet
fruit
kind
of
remind
me
of
weyerbacher
raspberry
impy
stout
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
the
elderberry
sweetnesssourness
and
the
bitterness
coming
form
the
roasted
malt
overall
i
would
say
that
i
enjoy
this
because
it
is
out
of
the
ordinary
and
that
seems
refreshing
black
very
black
a
shade
or
two
lighter
than
pepsi
but
still
black
no
other
colours
shine
through
no
real
head
just
a
ring
of
lace
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
still
some
strings
of
lace
manage
to
stick
around
tart
berries
lemon
bread
and
oatmeal
on
the
nose
somewhere
their
is
a
smell
of
a
campfire
im
not
sure
what
it
is
though
burning
wood
smoke
food
cooking
over
the
fire
simply
complex
if
that
makes
any
sense
big
taste
of
tart
wildberries
and
lemon
mingle
with
a
malty
sweetness
the
oats
come
through
with
their
soft
subtle
tones
not
very
many
hops
i
can
detect
the
tartness
is
commanding
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
bodied
the
blend
of
sweet
and
sour
makes
this
an
after
dinner
beer
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
maltyness
and
bitterness
even
though
there
are
no
real
hop
presents
in
this
beer
the
fruit
is
a
secondary
character
that
compliments
the
grains
very
nicely
a
bold
beer
to
a
historic
recipe
that
is
top
quality
pretty
hard
for
one
to
get
their
hands
on
one
of
these
without
buying
a
historic
ales
of
scotland
4
pack
so
thats
exactly
what
i
did
poured
into
a
chalice
a
deep
dark
hue
more
of
an
intense
opaque
brown
than
a
black
ruby
red
highlights
around
the
base
when
held
to
direct
light
otherwise
pretty
damn
opaque
spongy
tan
head
on
the
pour
big
bubbles
throughout
but
it
becomes
more
creamy
as
the
ale
settles
in
the
glass
sticky
lacing
coffee
and
roasted
chocolate
malt
immediately
on
the
nose
with
a
piney
backbone
to
it
somewhat
herbal
with
notes
of
dates
and
currents
the
aroma
becomes
a
bit
sour
at
the
very
end
roasted
malt
and
some
espresso
at
first
in
the
flavour
a
herbal
woodsy
taste
in
the
middle
with
bitter
malt
and
some
grassy
herbal
notes
on
the
finish
from
the
elderberries
i
would
assume
the
body
texture
is
light
but
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
bit
velvety
thanks
to
the
good
head
retention
a
nice
sipping
ale
malty
with
some
herbal
quirks
i
enjoyed
it
even
though
i
am
not
craving
another
one
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
herbal
beers
and
the
ebulum
tickles
it
enough
for
the
mean
time
those
welsh
druids
knew
what
they
were
doing
taste
roasted
malt
but
with
a
nice
sweet
and
tart
blackberry
twang
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
magic
hats
feast
of
fools
albeit
a
much
more
tame
version
last

raw
dr

abv
is
a
surprise
i
had
this
one
in
the
45
range
an
authentic
olde
style
which
needs
to
be
warmed
above
fridge
temps
never
having
had
elderberries
this
has
a
slight
berry
suggestion
at
best
history
lesson

the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tanbrown
color
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
and
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
roasted
barley
black
and
caramel
malts
along
with
a
faint
elderberry
aroma
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
smooth
and
rich
black
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
a
slight
tart
elderberry
taste
its
got
a
pretty
unique
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
it
has
a
complex
palate
that
is
quite
tastey
and
drinkable
a
bit
thin
and
a
unique
taste
that
makes
this
a
sort
of
finisher
beer
one
a
night
but
one
id
buy
regularly
drinkability
pretty
smooth
and
different
tasting
beer
probably
wouldnt
try
again
but
im
glad
i
did
and
would
recommend
it
to
those
who
like
the
smokeir
type
beers
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
a
little
head
good
lacing
though
smells
at
first
of
some
berries
elderberries
i
assume
but
then
there
is
a
strong
astringency
from
alcohol
also
there
is
some
malts
present
in
the
nose
taste
follows
the
smells
with
some
berriness
in
the
background
some
solid
sweet
licorice
malts
and
a
strong
astringency
it
would
be
better
if
the
alcohol
was
more
incorporated
into
the
brew
overall
eh

i
hate
to
say
i
dont
like
this
beer
but
i
do
not
i
would
not
recommend
it
and
dont
plan
on
having
it
again
although
i
did
not
find
enough
flaws
to
rate
it
poorly
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
i
was
surprised
by
how
large
the
flavor
and
body
were
really
impressed
has
a
nice
mix
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
a
deep
cordial
fruit
taste
to
compliment
poured
a
dark
solid
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
tan
coloured
head
aroma
of
berries
burnt
coffee
and
slight
alcohol
taste
was
certainly
distinctive
i
expected
a
fruity
beer
but
this
was
it
at
all
it
was
dark
roasted
coffee
with
a
pleasant
berry
flavour
that
accompanies
the
bitterness
excellent
balance
great
creamy
mouthfeel
a
unique
ale
recommended
dark
rootbeery
brown
and
pitch
dark
thick
beige
ring
of
head
at
the
edges
with
a
thin
dusting
swirling
through
across
the
top
strong
burgundyport
scent
with
dark
berries
with
that
scent
i
really
expected
to
get
a
sweetsour
flavor
but
this
is
more
of
a
dry
and
dark
flavor
dry
house
red
wine
with
a
bit
of
black
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
thin
mouthfeel
with
low
carbination
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
decent
drinkablity
due
to
the
low
carbination
ok
flavor
but
not
one
i
will
be
going
back
to
again
overall
enjoyable
enough
m
f
drinkability
this
has
that
nice
roasted
feel
on
the
palate
this
goes
down
incredably
easy
and
is
something
i
will
want
to
drink
many
many
more
times
in
my
life
the
only
downside
is
that
this
style
very
filling
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
world
class
brew
this
is
one
hell
of
a
good
beer
it
pours
a
near
opaque
black
with
a
vanishing
head
and
no
lace
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
cereals
chocolate
malts
and
a
subtle
berry
fruityness
the
taste
is
an
excellent
blend
of
roasted
barley
and
thick
malts
and
dark
berry
notes
its
like
a
fruit
stout
the
hop
rate
is
low
but
good
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
thick
with
low
carbonation
this
finish
is
an
excellent
blend
of
black
malts
hops
and
an
understated
berry
flavor
the
fruit
isnt
overpowering
at
all
and
very
natural
tasting
a
great
beer
from
a
very
cool
brewery
ink
black
appearance
bubbly
yet
thin
brown
head
lacing
is
better
than
average
and
the
retention
is
adequate
thick
roasted
aroma
mixes
with
berries
nicely
char
and
burnt
malt
is
evident
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
low
on
carbonation
and
body
only
slightly
spritzy
barely
noticeable
the
taste
is
pleasant
though
blackened
malts
char
and
burnt
toast
combine
nicely
with
the
dark
berry
characteristic
pretty
enjoyable
worth
a
try

thats
difficult
to
describe
muted

some

i
like

elderberry
black
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
this
is
no
pansy
fruit
beer
but
is
a
bold
sweetspicy
darkly
fruity
concoction
that
pushes
my
buttons
and
makes
me
say
hell
yeah
if
i
ever
decide
to
become
a
druid
this
will
be
my
official
daily
quaff
pours
as
black
as
night
small
tan

dissipates
quickly
leaving
only
a
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
top
of
my
gobblet
smell
is
a
sour
berry
and
hops
scent
a
little
coffeelike
taste
is
again
very
sour
probably
due
to
the
elderberries
i
dont
have
a
clue
what
an
elderberry
is
supposed
to
taste
like
definietely
a
sipper
not
seessionable
at
all
still
not
bad
i
dont
know
about
the
whole
elderberry
concept
not
a
particularly
strong
fruit
presence
but
one
that
very
nicely
accents
the
porter
qualities
a
very
nice
little
beer
nice
sipper
of
a
beer
quite
complex
not
a
session
ale
by
anymeans
this
would
be
a
good
compliment
to
a
cooler
evening
where
stouts
and
porters
are
being
served
in
fact
if
you
dont
normally
like
the
more
robust
stouts
you
might
enjoy
this
as
it
seems
to
take
on
the
best
characteristics
of
a
fine
stout
without
some
of
the
harshnessbitterness
of
the
style
slainte
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
nice
warm
evening
kicking
back
watching
the
sun
set
the
pour
is
jet
black
the
beer
does
not
offer
much
in
the
way
of

but
proffers
elegant

throughout
aromas
are
of
roasted

mocha
and
some

i

and

tannin
with

this
is
an

perhaps
this
would

pretty
cool
thanks
deep
and
solid
black
liquid
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
head
doesnt
last
long
but
leaves
small
tufts
of
foam
clinging
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
an
unrestrained
mix
malt
and
fruit
the
berry
in
the
smell
seems
misplaced
at
first
but
as
you
start
drinking
the
beer
it
settles
into
a
very
nice
harmony
the
smell
is
hints
at
a
sweeter
beer
than
actually
follows
the
taste
is
dry
grainy
and
full
of
roasted
malts
berry
flavor
is
folded
very
nicely
into
every
aspect
of
the
beer
they
did
a
great
job
of
matching
the
sensations
rich
and
complex
with
medium
body
mildly
oily
finish
is
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
but
has
a
nice
berry
followthrough
nicely
done
not
a
bad
fruit
beer
poured
black
with
a
very
little
head
smell
was
distinctly
malty
and
fruity
very
pleasant
taste
was
almost
winelike
with
an
alcohol
presence
but
not
overbearing
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
astringent
which
took
away
from
the
overall
experience
imo
drinkability
was
certainly
passable
though
you
dont
want
to
guzzle
for
sure
although
the
flavor
is
not
very
juicey
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
juicey
combining
toasted
grain
and
berries
must
be
difficult
one
may
easily
overwhelm
the
other
ive
smelled
50
merlots
that
didnt
have
this
much
poise
and
sophistication
chunky
brute
surges
of
raw
cocoa
are
decorated
with
flavors
and
aromas
of
deep
concentrated
pasty
blackberry
reduction
gamy
wild
and
peppery
attitude
rises
up
from
the
dry
tightly
organized
palate
very
scottish
in
the
sense
that
it
displays
all
of
the
coffeetinged
maltiness
one
expects
from
that
countrys
ales
the
berry
fruit
is
strictly
a
condiment
but
pure
natural
and
good
interesting
beer
experience
this
beer
is
real
real
dark
and
leaves
a
scrummy
brown
lacing
around
the
glass
nice
sweet
malty
smell
packs
a
punch
eminently
heavy
hop
finish
balances
the
sweet
roasted
malts
i
had
no
idea
this
was
really
made
from
elderberries
and
presumed
it
to
be
another
scotch
dark
ale
the
6
5
disappears
in
the
rich
taste
drinkabilitynotes
this
beer
had
me
scowling
and
looking
at
it
repeatedly
i
cant
figure
this
one
out
its
a
fairly
decent
beer
it
seems
to
pair
pretty
well
with
the
chunk
of
extra
sharp
cheddar
i
was
munching
on
not
as
good
as
a
bells
cherry
stout
and
a
sa
cherry
wheat
kicks
the
tail
outa
this
one
but
its
a
decent
brew
and
just
the
offthewall
factor
gives
it
a
few
points
in
my
book
pours
a
deep
chocolate
color
with
no
head
retention
a
smooth
aroma
wafts
strongly
of
berry
and
a
perfume
of
floral
and
chocolate
tones
the
body
is
smooth
as
is
the
malt
flavor
with
deep
hints
of
chocolate
and
potpourri
the
berries
finish
the
ale
with
a
moderate
bitterness
very
smooth
and
melded
to
be
very
tasty
this
ale
poured
a
very
very
dark
almost
opaque
black
with
hints
of
redbrown
near
the
edges
with
thin
tan
foam
the
smell
was
mildly
malty
with
a
faint
sweet
berry
aroma
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
nice
blackberrylike
flavor
very
well
balanced
and
not
overly
sweet
or
fruity
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
there
was
a
slight
tartness
and
a
lingering
malty
fruity
flavor
this
was
actually
a
very
nice
and
enjoyable
ale
very
nice
offering
for
the
style
will
be
happy
to
meet
this
brew
again
this
is
really
some
far
out
stuff
pours
deep
black
like
a
stout
with
a
minimal
tan
head
nose
is
lightly
fruity
and
sweet
but
also
tart
the
first
thing
youll
notice
when
you
take
a
sip
is
just
how
damned
smooth
it
is
any
crispness
seems
to
take
a
couple
of
seconds
to
formulate
the
first
thing
youll
taste
is
a
lemonyberry
flavor
then
will
come
the
sweet
malts
there
seem
to
actually
be
some
stout
characteristics
to
the
flavor
of
this
beer
perhaps
its
the
roasted
and
toasted
malts
and
oats
the
beer
also
has
a
real
warming
effect
this
beer
is
really
hard
to
describe
in
many
ways
the
tastes
are
subtle
source
liquid
solutions
comments

ive
never
eaten
an
elderberry
before
so
its
difficult
to
say
whether
this
ale
is
picking
up
the
correct
taste
it
is
supposedly
a
dark
berry
so
in
this
manner
it
is
right
on
target
strange
but
well
done
tasted
4
february
2003
at
maxs
on
broadway
in
baltimore
md
the
firkin
had
been
broached
for
24
hours
and
then
served
on
the
bar
at
50f
open
to
atmosphere
and
gravitydrawn
black
with
a
tan
head
like
a
regular
black
ale
roasted
aroma
with
elderberries
and
a
little
peatiness
light
maltiness
almost
reminds
me
of
a1
steak
sauce
oddly
enough
the
flavors
are
lighter
than
i
expected
but
its
tasty
definite
berry
flavors
with
roasted
undertones
and
spices
the
malt
is
grainy
and
cereallike
this
reminds
me
in
a
way
of
sam
adams
old
fezziwig
ale
or
winter
lager
or
should
that
be
the
other
way
around
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
seems
like
it
should
be
a
holiday
seasonal
with
the
spiciness
and
the
berry
flavors
very
cool
bottle
cap
and
i
liked
the
celtic
symbols
and
design
on
the
label
that
hint
at
some
mysterious
origins
of
this
beer
in
the
scottish
highlands
very
little
head
appears
whats
there
is
a
nice
tan
color
body
of
the
beer
is
black
not
much
light
passing
through
this
one
i
dont
know
what
elderberries
smell
or
taste
like
but
im
hoping
to
find
out
not
much
berry
smell
here
i
smell
some
sweet
malts
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
very
nice
a
slight
tang
at
the
beginning
with
strong
roasted
flavors
in
the
middle
barley
and
malts
some
oily
hops
on
the
finish
and
a
barely
noticeable
tangy
aftertaste
unfortunately
i
still
dont
know
what
elderberries
smell
or
taste
like
i
dont
think
that
i
would
classify
this
as
a
fruit
beer
its
a
really
good
black
ale
though
seems
that
i
should
be
drinking
this
at
a
renaissance
fair
out
of
a
leather
pint
glass
after
eating
a
giant
turkey
leg
overall
certainly
different
and
unique
as
most
of
the
beers
from
heather
ales
are
i
was
hoping
for
more
elderberries
to
be
honest
but
this
is
still
a
nice
change
and
quite
a
pleasant
drinkable
beer
nevertheless
worth
trying
but
not
one
that
i
would
purposely
seek
out
again
a
nice
dark
brown
but
clear
brown
color
with
a
light
ring
of
foam
for
head
which
quickly
fades
the
aroma
is
nice
and
fruity
with
a
sweet
and
lightly
hopped
smell
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
nice
mellow
feel
its
maltly
and
flavorful
with
very
little
aftertaste
but
a
slight
bitterness
towards
the
end
of
the
drink
overall
a
pretty
good
sipping
beer
overall
impression
definitely
an
interesting
one
not
quite
sure
if
i
like
it
tastes
like
it
might
be
good
for
you
beer
can
be
pretty
good
for
you
anyway
but
this
tastes
like
it
not
as
good
as
their
alba
scots
pine
or
heather
ale
which
are
transcendant
this
is
one
interesting
brew
very
dark
which
i
liked
to
see
had
an
aroma
of
roasted
flavors
and
berries
tastes
of
some
roasted
woody
flavors
then
a
strong
sweet
fruitness
came
through
elderberries
i
guess
and
chocolate
was
also
detected
the
finish
was
very
dry
which
i
didnt
care
for
in
this
brew
it
still
was
a
good
sweet
tasting
beer
pleasing
aroma
of
chocolate
taffy
brings
me
back
to
childhood
days
spent
at
the
jersey
shore
chocolate
also
comes
through
in
the
flavor
profile
along
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
poured
a
black
cherry
in
color
with
absolutely
zero
head
no
bitterness
was
percieved
surprising
light
bodied
considering
the
color
and
malt
profile
in
the
mouth
very
nice
very
tasty
indeed
elderberry
i
like
the
way
it
just
rolls
off
my
tongue
drinking
this
would
bring
me
closer
to
monty
python
or
so
i
assumed
poured
a
dark
black
color
with
barely
a
head
hmmmm
taste
was
slighty
sweet
with
a
somewhat
fruity
taste
i
couldnt
really
detect
the
elderberry
but
that
didnt
keep
me
from
saying
it
over
and
over
again
in
an
aweful
english
accent
to
the
chagrin
of
my
wife
of
course
she
had
to
point
out
it
was
a
scottish
ale
thus
ruining
my
mirth
bullocks
not
a
great
deal
of
aftertaste
but
i
do
notice
a
touch
of
astringency
or
sourness
maybe
from
the
fruit
juice
outside
of
that
it
has
a
rather
clean
finish
something
you
wont
experience
much
is
a
beer
as
dark
as
this
i
could
make
a
night
out
of
these
black
in
color
with
just
a
thin
halo
of
dark
tan
head
fruit
doesnt
come
through
much
in
aroma
smells
mostly
just
like
any
other
black
ale
with
roasty
grainy
malt
dominating
the
flavor
though
is
a
really
nice
blend
of
roasted
maltiness
at
the
start
and
slightly
sweet
elderberry
midpalate
the
malt
takes
on
a
chocolatey
flavor
midway
through
which
compliments
the
elderberry
extremely
well
fairly
creamy
smooth
in
mouth
i
was
surprised
how
well
i
liked
this
beer
this
beer
pours
the
blackest
of
black
beers
with
a
slightly
red
tone
around
the
edges
almost
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
reminds
me
much
of
a
dark
wine
with
hints
of
alcohol
overpowering
slight
hints
of
fruits
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
tastes
of
berries
but
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
as
well
this
beer
is
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
the
alcohol
is
very
poorly
masked
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
it
again
pitch
black
with
a
ruby
glow
visible
at
the
edge
of
the
glass
dark
roasted
malt
aroma
with
a
ghost
of
chocolate
an
interesting
interplay
of
slightly
tart
flavors
intermingled
with
smoky
malt
raspberryish
notes
ring
out
softly
at
the
finish
ive
had
berry
flavored
stouts
before
but
this
is
the
first
one
that
really
seems
to
work
very
tasty
and
drinkability
is
quite
good
pours
stoutlike
not
as
thick
though
almost
black
almost
opaque
aroma
is
kind
of
a
sweet
cocoa
and
coffee
pretty
enjoyable
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
i
dont
notice
any
elderberries
whatever
they
are
i
taste
mostly
sweet
maltiness
and
roastiness
its
an
enjoyable
flavor
but
maybe
not
a
beer
i
would
get
goosebumps
for
pours
out
very
dark
with
a
light
brown
head
the
elderberry
taste
comes
through
well
the
malts
are
well
balanced
and
the
hops
are
light
but
enough
to
further
balance
the
brew
certainly
worth
a
tasting
as
dark
fruity
beers
dont
come
around
too
often
this
beer
would
go
great
with
a
cherry
or
blueberry
pie
this
beer
was
given
to
me
by
a
fellow
bar
patron
who
did
not
know
what
she
was
getting
into
it
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
white
head
that
held
at
about
1
inch
reminded
me
of
a
guiness
a
different
smell
i
could
not
put
my
finger
on
i
guess
the
elderberry
licorace
almost
sambuca
like
faint
coffee
roasted
malts
very
smooth
mouthfeel
creamy
and
dry
im
sure
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
the
flavor
interesting
but
one
was
enough
for
me
the
beer
pours
an
opaque
brown
with
highlights
of
garnet
the
head
passable
in
size
frothy
in
consistency
light
chocolate
brown
in
color
as
it
evanesces
it
leaves
behind
a
thick
and
clinging
sheet
of
lace
lightly
roasted
grains
also
the
aroma
of
lightly
burnt
coffee
beans
sweet
and
different
to
be
sure
start
is
loaded
with
malt
sweet
the
top
middling
in
feel
with
the
finish
sparingly
acidic
the
hops
personable
but
not
overly
so
very
dry
aftertaste
quite
quaffable
good
but
not
great
and
well
worth
a
sample
definitely
a
night
cap
for
me
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
row
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
had
gotten
it
for
my
fiancee
because
she
likes
sweeter
beers
and
i
gave
it
a
go
i
was
suprised
in
the
way
that
they
didnt
over
sweeten
the
beer
from
its
alcoholy
roots
they
balanced
everything
very
nicely
good
blackishpurple
color
to
it
in
the
glass
had
a
nice
semidry
finish
but
not
too
dry
so
it
went
down
nice
and
smooth
murky
black
color
head
was
a
dense
explosive
beige
pillow
huge
bubbles
pop
through
one
of
the
more
impressive
visual
beers
i
have
seen
think
imperial
strout
on
the
sweet
side
huge
head
left
a
foamy
ring
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
smells
were
a
rich
sweet
combination
of
roasted
plums
raisans
and
elderberries
the
elderberry
tasted
like
an
earthy
roasted
blueberry
to
me
nice
combination
of
fruit
and
carbonation
make
for
an
very
tasty
beer
dark
rich
complex
and
full
of
flavors
but
very
light
bodied
and
nearly
bubbly
a
beer
deserving
of
your
attention
highly
recommended
and
very
memorable
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
a
one
of
a
kind
fruit
beer
hmmm
this
is
great
pours
an
incredible
black
color
slight
tinges
of
brown
around
the
edges
but
youve
got
to
look
for
them
the
head
is
shortlived
and
also
darker
than
most
beers
first
whiff
brings
in
a
sweet
smokey
roasted
sort
of
order
following
this
up
on
the
taste
are
an
initial
authentic
elderberry
tang
followed
by
the
roast
flavour
and
finishing
up
a
moment
later
is
a
aftertaste
like
that
of
actual
elderberries
kind
of
syrupy
feeling
on
the
toungue
with
a
light
spritzing
carbonation
certainly
drinkable
especially
with
the
bittersweet
aftertaste
a
winner
interesting
history
lesson
but
i
wont
be
studying
it
again
any
time
soon
black
in
color
and
quite
opaque
the
head
is
tannish
with
what
seems
to
be
a
pink
tint
unfortunately
the
head
is
fairly
limited
and
drops
quickly
leaving
an
average
collar
and
very
limited
lace
the
aroma
expresses
a
soft
fruitiness
which
is
quickly
overshadowed
by
roasty
notes
very
intriguing
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
light
giving
it
a
soft
creaminess
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
starts
a
bit
chocolatey
becoming
a
bit
winelike
toward
the
finish
and
leaves
a
lingering
lightly
sweet
and
creamy
berry
flavor
very
nice
and
quite
unique
well
worth
trying
makes
a
great
after
dinner
beer
okay
this
is
the
heather
ale
i
been
waiting
to
try
growing
up
on
a
farm
we
had
elderberrys
and
dishes
made
from
them
like
pies
jamsjellies
crispcrumble
and
of
course
wine
so
how
does
a
beer
version
fair
it
poured
out
an
amazingly
dark
color
and
had
a
dark
tan
head
i
had
it
at
a
warmeer
temperature
that
may
account
for
that
interesting
aroma
of
malts
and
elderberry
the
taste
definately
had
elements
of
elderberry
and
chocolate
a
good
dark
beer
notes
eclectic
and
complex
with
a
juicy
sweettart
fruitiness
within
id
put
this
in
my
dessert
beer
category
and
pair
this
one
with
chocolaty
and
or
fruity
desserts
certainly
a
specialty
brew
and
nothing
less
black
as
black
can
be
in
color
opaque
even
when
held
to
light
little
to
no
head
after
a
vigorous
pour
deep
dark
roasted
malt
aroma
with
the
slightest
hint
of
berries
taste
is
again
dark
roasted
malt
with
a
predominate
coffee
bitterness
surprisingly
so
since
one
might
suspect
a
sweeter
brew
finishes
smooth
bitter

this
is
a
really
good
black
ale
subtle
dark
malt
character
low
bitterness
and
just
a
hint
of
elderberry
at
the
end
in
my
opinion
it
need
more
berries
if
you
enjoyed
other
beers
from
this
brewery
you
have
to
try
this
one
if
you
are
not
into
heather
ale
co
beers
you
may
want
to
try
it
anyway
as
it
is
a
nice
balck
ale
o
excellent
brew
love
the
bottle
style
and
name
seaweed
lover
myself
living
in
asia
the
idea
of
a
kelp
beer
doesnt
bother
me
the
kelp
is
really
in
the
background
and
the
flavor
of
this
stout
like
beer
is
great
o
pretty
good
well
made
but
could
be
more
interesting
the
brawny
chocolate
malt
muscle
is
laid
out
just
pile
on
the
seaweed
dry
weed
it
even
it
has
an
interesting
distinct
somewhat
umami
quality
that
should
be
exploited
and
abused
could
be
a
little
more
salty
maybe
i
enjoy
and
advocate
balance
but
make
this
a
little
manlier
huh
o
the
nose
promised
greater
things
it
falls
a
little
flat
especially
on
the
finish
needs
a
little
more
body
too
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
some
lacing
on
the
surface
smell
is
very
mild
caramel
malt
taste
is
primarily
a
rounded
caramel
malt
low
sweetness
underneath
but
still
fairly
prominent
is
what
must
be
the
seaweed
its
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
not
at
all
unpleasant
tastes
like
the
ocean
not
salty
at
all
but
then
again
maybe
there
is
a
hint
of
it
minerals
makes
me
want
to
reread
innsmouth
by
lovecraft
this
is
probably
what
they
were
drinking
there
or
maybe
rewatch
the
wicker
man
the
original
low
carbonation
medium
to
light
bodied
i
think
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
in
this
case
maybe
this
is
just
good
and
not
great
but
its
a
must
try
all
the
same
o
first
time
for
a
scottish
gruit
brew
interesting
flavor
would
drink
again
easy
drinking
dark
ale
i
rank
this
must
try
o
creativity
in
brewing
is
only
a
virtue
when
the
result
is
enjoyable
this
one
tastes
like
an
experiment
needing
a
few
more
attempts
and
adjustments
to
get
it
right
o
swing
and
a
miss
the
flavor
is
lightly
roasty
slightly
bitter
a
little
bit
herbal
all
nicely
balanced
into
a
very
palatable
beverage
this
was
a
cool
treat
overall
this
is
an
old
acquaintance
one
of
the
scottish
druid
ancient
recipe
ales
that
i
quite
like
for
me
they
deserve
points
for
originality
even
if
the
recipes
are
ancient
many
contemporary
attempts
at
herbed
or
spiced
ales
dont
produce
similar
results
there
it
is
my
personal
breakdown
of
this
somewhat
mediocre
beer
at
least
in
this
advocates
eyes
a
rather
poor
beer
for
me
here
it
was
far
too
light
on
the
nose
and
tasted
with
a
cheap
stout
mixed
with
salt
water
nothing
about
this
one
really
appealed
to
me
and
it
wont
be
one
ill
have
again
o
kind
of
a
novelty
to
have
seaweed
flavored
beer
interesting
revival
of
an
old
style
an
average
beer
overall
final
thoughts
an
exceptionally
well
done
beer
that
leaves
me
asking
why
dont
more
brewers
use
various
herbs
in
their
beer
i
can
only
guess
that
its
probably
hard
to
get
the
right
balance
however
this
brewery
seems
to
have
nailed
it
you
really
cant
go
wrong
with
any
of
the
beers
in
their
historic
ales
of
scotland
pack
and
if
you
havent
given
them
a
try
and
are
still
reading
this
take
this
advice
and
seek
it
out
taste
is
sweet
and
roasty
like
a
good
sessionworthy
porter
and
with
a
light
body
theres
a
slight
brininess
in
there
but
its
quite
subtle
as
the
chocolate
maltiness
and
dark
roasty
qualities
come
to
the
fore
a
solid
and
enjoyable
ale
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
deep
ruby
highlighted
dark
brown
coloring
with
no
head
aromas
of
toffee
and
nut
with
some
earthy
highlights
the
nose
leans
towards
a
malt
bomb
of
a
beer
we
shall
see
flavors
are
a
bit
more
earthy
than
the
nose
lets
on
with
a
rich
nut
and
toffee
sweetness
forming
the
backbone
green
gritty
highlights
and
a
touch
of
brine
keeps
the
brew
somewhat
light
despite
the
heavy
malt
characteristics
smooth
and
clean
in
mouth
the
beer
has
a
slightly
tangy
sweet
and
roasted
aftertaste
light
clean
finish
heavy
flavors
for
such
a
light
abv
making
this
surprisingly
drinkable
interesting
but
not
overly
exciting
id
suggest
only
trying
this
if
you
are
intrigued
by
the
seaweed
ingredient
otherwise
there
is
not
much
value
to
this
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
that
is
pretty
much
black
chocolate
there
is
a
nice
but
uneven
finger
width
head
the
color
of
cream
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
head
dwindles
down
to
a
slight
halffinger
width
and
slowly
dissipates
leaving
a
thin
outlining
of
lacing
there
does
seem
to
be
some
good
carbonation
hiding
in
the
blackness
of
this
beer
the
beer
smells
rich
with
chocolate
malts
and
salt
with
an
ohsoslight
brine
tingle
the
beer
tastes
slightly
smoky
with
peat
malts
and
chocolate
there
is
also
a
definite
oceanic
tint
to
this
beers
flavor
with
slight
hints
of
salt
and
i
assume
the
seaweed
it
is
a
very
interesting
taste
and
actually
quite
pleasant
like
a
sea
salt
chocolate
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
watery
mildly
reminiscent
of
the
ocean
though
that
may
be
because
i
am
thinking
seaweed
while
its
thinness
is
a
little
disappointing
it
makes
the
drink
quite
drinkable
the
after
taste
leaves
a
weird
lightly
brinelike
taste
while
leaving
the
mouth
clean
yet
slimy
if
that
makes
any
sense
overall
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
off
but
the
taste
is
unique
and
refreshing
which
definitely
makes
up
for
it
it
is
more
of
a
sipper
than
other
beers
though
despite
its
weak
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
if
for
nothing
else
than
the
fact
that
it
has
seaweed
in
it
which
is
weird
and
different
an
unusual
brew
but
goes
down
nicely
could
be
described
as
oyster
stout
for
vegetarians
the
aroma
has
a
distinct
chocolate
note
that
is
rather
pleasing
while
the
flavour
is
balanced
but
a
tad
less
substantial
lies
somewhere
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
porter
with
plenty
of
dark
malt
character
the
seaweed
doesnt
exactly
come
through
but
it
possesses
a
mild
salty
twist
tasty
and
well
worth
trying
this
beer
pouts
out
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
rich
with
caramel
malts
and
chocolate
the
taste
isnt
nearly
as
strange
as
i
expected
this
is
just
a
solid
english
style
brown
with
just
a
bit
of
salt
on
the
end
probably
from
the
seaweed
its
a
robustly
malty
ale
otherwise
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
flavors
that
work
well
with
the
salt
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
moderately
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
this
is
a
solid
brown
ale
made
ever
so
slightly
interesting
with
the
touch
of
salt
o
i
would
never
seek
this
beer
out
again
i
find
that
the
utter
lack
of
body
is
incredibly
offputting
and
the
flavor
is
utterly
nondescript
just
a
boring
mediocre
beer
with
no

this
is
my
900th
beer
advocate
review
and
i
think
i
picked
a
pretty
good
one
to
celebrate
it
the
pour
is
a
gorgeous
dark
ruby
red
brown
with
a
moderate
head
the
aroma
is
wonderfully
robust
with
dark
smoky
roasted
malts
something
akin
to
prunes
and
something
like
molasses
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
sweet
porter
the
body
is
medium
to
bold
the
taste
is
also
smoky
goodness
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
moderate
bitterness
o
my
girlfriend
bought
me
this
beer
because
it
looked
unique
the
flavors
are
strange
but
not
unpleasant
it
was
worth
trying
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
it
was
cool
to
see
this
in
the
scottish
ales
sampler
instead
of
grozet
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
a
whispy
short
lived
head
that
musters
a
good
amount
of
lace
the
aroma
is
malty
and
nearly
smokey
with
a
good
amount
of
sea
air
the
taste
is
of
chocolate
malts
roasted
malts
chicory
and
some
faint
salt
in
the
back
i
cant
detect
any
specific
seaweed
flavors
hops
are
quite
restrained
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
with
a
prickly
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
seaweed
may
be
more
of
a
marketing
tool
than
anything
else
but
the
backbone
is
a
good
brown
ale
easy
to
drink
not
quite
like
any
other
beer
ive
had
i
would
definitely
be
interested
in
trying
this
on
tap
this
would
be
a
great
ale
to
consume
with
good
pub
food
o
a
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
tried
just
dont
think
ill
be
buying
it
again
3
5
o
not
a
great
beer
but
not
the
worst
i
dont
get
anything
out
of
the
seaweed
being
there
at
all
if
you
gave
me
this
beer
id
be
hard
pressed
to
figure
out
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
let
alone
that
there
is
seaweed
in
here
o
a
good
session
beer
definitely
something
unique
since
i
have
not
had
a
traditional
version
of
this
in
scotland
i
have
no
basis
for
comparison
when
judging
how
true
to
style
this
beer
is
fun
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
have
this
beer
again
if
offered
pours
out
a
deep
dark
brown
in
color
which
almost
passes
for
black
until
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
for
closer
inspection
two
finger
head
is
a
creamy
tan
color
and
has
solid
retention
but
very
little
lacing
left
behind
on
top
of
a
roasted
porterlike
malt
scent
is
an
odd
kind
of
clean
salty
brine
smell
that
has
absolutely
no
fishiness
whatsoever
to
it
flavor
is
once
again
like
a
weaker
porter
well
balanced
with
mild
hopping
on
top
of
a
roasted
barley
foundation
but
it
also
has
the
slightly
thicker
umami
feel
that
i
have
experienced
from
seaweed
soup
at
a
japanese
restaurant
only
none
of
the
seaweed
flavor
honestly
i
was
bracing
myself
expecting
to
taste
andor
smell
seaweed
and
feel
strangely
disappointed
the
seaweed
really
does
just
come
across
as
a
slightly
heavier
fuller
body
and
a
mild
whiff
of
sea
breeze
otherwise
a
fairly
nice
mild
porter
overall
its
a
solid
interesting
beer
its
a
little
pricey
for
what
it
is
though
i
got
it
for
4
50
for
a
16
9
oz
bottle
all
around
a
good
beer
drank
this
first
in
a
sampler
of
different
scottish
ales
that
was
put
out
by
williams
brothers
i
assumed
it
would
probably
not
taste
very
good
and
would
be
a
novelty
ale
i
was
quite
pleasant
it
appeared
dark
had
a
sort
of
smokey
taste
to
it
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
barley
flavor
was
the
most
noticeable
element
of
this
brew
it
had
a
very
full
flavor
too
and
was
not
watery
at
all
like
some
beers
in
this
category
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
was
a
fave
but
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
offered
one
again
wary
stomachs
be
not
alarmed
adventurous
palates
likely
be
disappointed
the
williams
brothers
have
made
very
original
material
from
very
unoriginal
parts
it
is
an
undeniably
enjoyable
ale
and
to
be
fair
slightly
distinguished
but
apart
from
the
novelty
aspect
i
cant
see
much
other
reason
to
lay
the
money
down
on
this
one
maybe
pass
o
a
very
unique
and
complex
beer
definitely
worth
trying
to
the
complexities
of
the
flavors
overall
a
good
beer
with
a
slightly
drifrent
but
good
taste
would
buy
agian
prolly
a
case
for
sure
overall
a
very
nice
beer
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
moreys
bottom
line
well
i
havent
had
any
other
seaweed
ales
to
compare
this
to
but
this
isnt
as
good
as
the
elderberry
ale
that
came
in
the
mixed
4
pack
imo
worth
a
try
though
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
didnt
get
any
seaweed
notes
the
malts
are
nice
but
are
very
mellow
and
a
bit
watered
down
o
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
going
into
this
ale
but
it
definitely
had
a
unique
quality
i
think
maybe
it
should
be
renamed
to
chocolate
seaweed
ale
but
then
that
might
confuse
people
overall
not
bad
a
quite
ok
beer
the
missing
hops
are
nearly
not
noticed
overall
just
a
thinnish
light
alcohol
porter
is
what
youre
getting
here
for
having
the
word
seaweed
plastered
across
the
bottle
i
kind
of
wished
theyd
have
really
let
me
have
it
with
seaweed
taste
but
hey
that
dried
seaweed
stuff
aint
exactly
cheap
and
in
todays
global
economy
well
o
didnt
expect
to
like
this
one
but
i
did
i
dont
see
myself
getting
this
again
because
ive
only
seen
it
in
the
packs
even
if
it
was
sold
in
singles
i
probably
would
only
drink
12
of
these
at
a
time
best
before
date
indicated
is
nov
2011
into
a
snifter
on
6
16
11
this
pours
the
darkest
brown
color
practically
black
under
a
persistent
frothy
tan
head
aroma
is
inviting
with
notes
of
deep
earthy
sweet
dark
chocolate
malt
fresh
oatmeal
and
a
significant
milky
note
to
complement
smells
like
a
more
intense
version
of
a
chocolate
milk
the
general
feel
and
taste
on
the
palate
is
quite
different
that
what
the
nose
indicates
deep
roasted
malt
character
is
clearly
present
but
mellowed
out
by
the
herbal
seaweed
and
perhaps
hop
character
that
runs
a
smooth
and
lightly
crisp
agenda
from
start
to
finish
with
ending
notes
of
dry
cocoa
and
very
lightly
salted
nuts
with
a
4
4
abv
and
an
overall
mild
profile
this
seems
like
it
would
be
a
great
session
brew
medium
bodied
mediumdark
ale
with
very
little
hops
presence
and
just
a
hint
of
sea
salt
and
ocean
breeze
from
the
seaweed
these
brewers
from
alloa
are
doing
wonderful
things
look
out
brew
dogs
youve
got
competition
taste
isnt
bad
at
all
its
not
outstanding
either
if
it
had
more
of
coffee
or
chocolate
or
roasted
malt
this
would
be
a
darn
good
porter
but
it
falls
a
bit
short
on
all
seaweed
not
sure
it
does
have
a
pinch
of
salt
which
makes
the
coffeechocolate
stop
short
not
sure
what
the
kelp
does
to
this
beer
oh
well
its
still
a
good
beer
the
beer
feels
refreshing
but
it
seems
that
the
addition
of
seaweeds
did
not
improve
the
flavor
in
any
way
this
took
all
i
had
to
try
this
brew
i
was
just
hoping
that
this
didnt
actually
taste
like
seaweed
the
beer
didnt
taste
like
seaweed
thankfully
that
has
the
flavors
of
a
good
some
faint
chocolate
in
the
mix
along
with
the
malts
theyve
used
in
it
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
pretty
smooth
too
the
aroma
of
the
been
had
a
slight
smell
of
ocean
to
me
but
mostly
malts
hops
and
other
traditional
smells
were
coming
off
this
one
the
beer
is
not
bad
at
all
i
just
dont
see
myself
having
it
again
anytime
soon
overall
id
recommend
this
for
sure
its
an
interesting
recipe
with
some
pretty
solid
results
conclusion
it
was
interesting
the
mineral
aspect
seemed
to
make
this
distinctive
im
glad
i
bought
it
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
this
was
a
onetime
only
beer
for
me
d
all
in
all
this
is
an
interesting
beer
nice
malty
flavours
with
that
slight
salty
addition
this
is
quite
unique
i
dig
the
seaweed
in
this
though
maybe
want
it
pushed
a
bit
more
with
even
more
seaweed
power
mashed
in
with
bladderwrack
seaweed
which
is
know
for
its
unique
flavor
and
supposed
medicinal
qualities
dark
lets
call
it
black
impressive
lacing
to
say
the
least
sweet
treacle
maltiness
with
a
faint
ocean
saltiness
in
the
nose
smooth
and
wet
with
a
delicate
moderately
sized
body
small
hop
character
is
there
to
balance
and
nothing
else
dry
toasted
malt
flavor
seems
to
play
the
same
tune
but
at
least
sticks
to
the
palate
a
bit
of
earthy
yeast
and
vague
fruit
in
the
dry
and
lightly
salty
finish
a
great
example
of
what
an
extreme
beer
can
be
dark
ale
with
seaweed
bam
extreme
aside
from
that
this
ends
up
being
a
great
session
ale
that
lands
outside
of
the
box
o
this
is
something
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
trying
and
am
really
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
split
one
of
these
with
my
pops
having
said
that
i
respect
what
is
going
on
here
and
truly
appreciate
how
different
it
is
but
i
cant
say
it
is
something
ill
go
back
to
give
it
a
spin
though
as
i
cant
think
of
another
beer
quite
like
it
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
little
crimson
hiding
in
there
no
headlace
to
speak
of
aroma
is
a
nutty
cocoa
flavor
and
reminds
me
of
a
chocolate
porter
but
that
roastiness
disappears
when
i
take
a
sip
mouthfeel
is
very
very
thin
and
not
as
chocolatey
as
the
nose
would
suggest
i
guess
i
cant
hate
on
this
beer
too
much
if
indeed
it
is
authentically
brewed
to
style
and
tastes
like
its
supposed
to
i
just
dont
understand
why
youd
make
a
big
deal
about
the
seaweed
if
its
completely
undetectable
all
in
all
i
wasnt
impressed
the
beer
poured
very
dark
with
a
poor
head
and
lacing
the
smell
was
mostly
chocolate
malts
with
perhaps
a
slight
spiciness
to
it
it
tasted
like
an
english
stout
nice
toasty
chocolate
character
the
feel
of
the
beer
was
very
wet
and
watery
the
beer
had
lots
of
flavour
and
it
went
down
very
easily
it
was
quite
drinkable
but
i
paid
for
the
novelty
of
the
beer
and
was
let
down
d
the
smell
and
taste
of
seaweed
is
very
mild
which
makes
this
beer
rather
drinkable
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
because
it
is
a
unique
beer
dto
my
surprise
i
enjoyed
drinking
every
ounce
of
this
beer
it
seemed
to
get
more
friendly
towards
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
maybe
the
less
desirable
flavors
started
to
mesh
out
the
low
abv
makes
this
a
great
drinker

here
goes
nothing
pours
about
as
dark
a
color
ive
seen
on
a
beer
in
a
long
time
basically
black
with
a
thin
head
some
lacing
smells
like
roasted
malts
earthiness
and
a
bit
salty
surprisingly
for
being
a
seaweed
ale
this
brew
does
not
taste
like
poseidons
beard
almost
takes
like
a
porter
somewhat
smokey
with
some
roasted
malt
flavors
a
bit
chocolatey
not
what
i
expected
like
i
said
before
it
tastes
like
a
low
abv
porter
not
bad
such
a
dark
brown
that
it
could
pass
for
black
there
are
some
mahogany
highlights
visible
when
held
directly
to
light
about
a
finger
of
thick
tan
head
that
dropped
to
just
a
cover
over
the
top
of
the
brew
but
stayed
throughout
the
aroma
is
earthy
and
nutty
theres
also
chocolate
and
a
mossy
kinda
briny
note
maybe
im
just
adding
this
subconsciously
but
to
me
it
was
there
taste
is
rich
bitter
chocolate
up
front
with
slight
burnt
sugar
and
roasted
nuts
theres
a
smokybriny
note
in
the
flavor
as
well
but
it
comes
across
more
in
the
after
taste
than
during
the
drink
really
creamy
feel
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
but
it
certainly
exceeded
the
feeble
expectations
i
had
for
it
overall
an
ok
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
that
interesting
of
a
taste
and
the
carbonation
is
too
high
drinkability
this
reminds
me
of
a
weak
english
porter
overall
if
you
were
to
put
this
in
front
of
me
and
not
tell
me
where
it
was
from
and
what
bottle
you
poured
it
from
id
think
it
was
an
english
porter
and
not
a
beer
with
seaweed
mashed
in
went
okay
with
a
meal
and
i
think
it
would
be
fine
by
itself
as
well
overall
okay
but
i
think
my
favorite
by
this
company
is
the
alba
scotch
pine
ale
drinkability
i
suppose
this
is
almost
good
but
it
doesnt
quite
hit
the
spot
for
me
the
burnt
flavor
doesnt
suit
me
this
beer
really
does
seem
like
a
porter
and
one
that
is
just
a
bit
above
average
d
overall
not
a
bad
brew
defiantly
a
great
scottish
craft
beer
and
kind
of
high
on
the
weird
scale
but
it
didnt
deliver
enough
bang
for
my
buck
to
bring
me
back
also
the
500ml
instead
of
a
12oz
is
kind
of
a
chore
to
drink
for
such
a
distinct
beer
so
it
was
sort
of
novelty
would
pass
on
future
purchases
d
you
could
drink
this
whole
playing
cards
the
carbonatiom
would
get
annoying
though
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
notes
of
coffee
taste
is
good
malts
and
coffee
maybe
a
touch
of
chocolate
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
good
quality
brew
d
quite
an
unusual
beer
and
recommended
drinkability
easy
drinking
smooth
beer
with
much
more
flavor
than
most
4
4
beers
slainte
i
approached
this
beer
expecting
it
to
be
hard
to
finish
i
mean
really
seaweed
beer
this
actually
was
a
pretty
good
beer
if
anything
i
didnt
pick
up
enough
seaweed
i
wouldve
liked
to
have
the
seaweed
been
a
little
more
prominent
in
the
brew
500
ml
bottle
best
before
may
2011
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
not
much
head
retention
but
there
is
a
lot
of
lacing
aroma
is
peat
earth
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
salt
and
seaweed
it
really
does
have
an
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
being
by
the
sea
or
lake
it
tastes
like
chocolate
saltbrine
earth
nuts
and
some
roasted
malt
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
but
not
watery
at
all
it
also
has
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
decent
overall
brew
for
a
brew
thats
only
4
4
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
wouldnt
be
a
bad
session
beer
on
occasion
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
very
often
this
really
is
a
good
beer
easy
to
drink
nice
flavor
and
that
unique
chocolatesalty
thing
works
very
well
notes
really
unique
beer
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
not
too
much
seaweed
flavor
really
just
some
brine
and
soillike
flavor
a
little
disappointed
as
i
would
like
to
try
a
beer
with
seaweed
front
and
center
as
far
as
taste
but
this
beer
as
it
is
isnt
bad
a
lot
like
a
porter
or
stout
with
some
interesting
taste
in
the
middle
and
at
the
end
of
the
sip
dthis
beer
is
certnly
resfreshing
but
the
seaweed
can
present
a
challenge
to
some
people
overall
its
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
a
few
of
but
would
certanly
not
drink
it
all
night
a
brown
ale
edging
towards
old
english
stout
flinty
and
clean
but
why
talk
up
the
seaweed
then
bury
it
in
a
dark
beer
definitely
some
salty
twang
but
nothing
to
get
fussed
about
d
aside
from
the
price
this
is
a
great
session
beer
a
very
enjoyable
pint
love
these
ancient
ales
that
cragmill
is
doing
i
feel
im
in
homage
to
my
celtic
heritage
when
i
drink
them
a
beer
id
love
to
have
with
oysters
and
a
big
seafood
spread
poured
into
a
wheat
type
glass
very
deep
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
slowly
gives
way
to
a
thick
film
with
minor
lacing
an
iron
aroma
to
start
and
as
it
warms
i
did
detect
an
oceany
aroma
first
sip
is
iron
but
after
that
i
dont
detect
it
hints
of
chocolate
malt
follow
very
well
balanced
and
very
mellow
in
taste
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
d
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
it
again
i
like
the
idea
bt
the
flavor
etc
is
just
ok
quite
quaffable
has
a
slight
tickle
at
the
back
which
is
enjoyable
and
flavour
is
subdued
but
balanced
sorry
guys
this
just
doesnt
cut
it
for
me
despite
the
uniqueness
of
the
recipe
it
doesnt
have
nearly
enough
on
the
palate
leaving
it
flaccid
and
weak
true
the
main
characters
it
has
are
dark
grainy
notes
but
they
exist
in
isolation
with
nothing
else
to
back
them
up
probably
chuggable
but
otherwise
disappointing
drinkability
light
enough
to
suck
down
but
it
gets
worse
as
it
goes
beer
has
a
lot
of
roast
also
beer
is
sweet
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
very
small
aftertaste
i
dont
really
like
this
style
of
beer
but
this
one
was
a
great
example
of
how
to
make
a
stout
with
ancient
ingredients
there
is
no
seaweed
flavors
or
anything
like
that
a
highly
drinkable
dark
ale
good
job
probably
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
so
far
overall
it
kind
of
tastes
like
an
average
porter
that
got
steeped
in
a
tiny
bit
of
dulse
with
a
pinch
of
salt
the
palate
is
a
little
more
traditional
porterlike
with
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
burnt
sugar
with
a
nutty
character
unfortunately
the
intensity
of
the
flavors
wash
out
the
delicate
seaweed
character
this
tastes
mostly
like
an
average
english
porter
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
little
bitterness
and
cocoa
character
im
going
to
attribute
the
mild
greenness
im
picking
out
to
the
power
of
suggestion
light
in
body
almost
watery
with
a
crisp
carbonation
this
beer
is
solid
on
the
palate
the
low
abv
makes
for
one
easy
to
drink
beer
too
one
that
i
will
revisit
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
mostly
opaque
brown
color
with
a
very
thin
light
brown
head
aroma
was
very
stout
like
strong
scent
of
burnt
brown
sugar
with
small
amounts
of
mocha
taste
was
like
burnt
oatmeal
chocolate
bread
felt
a
bit
thin
and
watery
in
the
mouth
but
not
overly
so
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
but
for
some
reason
it
begged
to
be
a
slow
sipper
not
sure
why
creamy
and
smooth
up
front
with
sweet
chocolate
center
and
a
salty
spicy
vegetable
presence
in
the
dry
hoppy
finish
for
a
light
abv
this
beer
has
some
rich
complexity
nicely
carbonated
and
has
nuances
to
ponder
making
this
a
good
session
beer
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
its
a
very
dark
brown
color
nearly
black
there
is
a
small
light
brown
head
of
tiny
bubbles
that
does
not
stick
to
the
glass
its
smells
roasty
and
chocolatey
but
also
a
hint
of
the
sea
the
taste
has
a
flavor
to
it
that
reminds
me
of
nori
the
dried
seaweed
used
in
sushi
there
is
also
a
bit
of
bitter
roasted
malt
there
really
isnt
much
of
an
aftertaste
it
just
disappears
once
you
swallow
it
has
average
carbonation
and
body
it
feels
a
little
creamy
moreso
than
i
expected
this
is
a
interesting
beer
i
imagine
that
most
people
like
myself
buy
it
because
they
are
curious
what
a
seaweed
beer
tastes
like
the
beer
is
of
a
high
enough
quality
to
make
it
more
than
a
novelty
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
its
just
not
one
that
i
would
want
to
drink
too
often
d
for
something
with
seaweed
in
the
name
kelpie
is
damn
drinkable
i
dont
know
that
id
sit
back
with
more
than
one
of
these
but
its
easy
to
get
down
and
quite
unoffensive
an
interesting
spin
on
a
mediumdry
stoutporter
drinkability
its
not
bad
but
not
great
i
could
drink
it
again
but
its
not
something
im
going
to
run
right
out
and
buy
again
while
not
the
throatiest
of
dark
beers
this
seaweed
brew
is
a
little
different
and
very
drinkable
cheers

did
not
think
it
would
be
so
boring
or
roast
dominated
drinkability
was
ok
but
i
would
rather
drink
a
real
stout
this
beer
is
a
little
to
watery
this
is
an
odd
beer
more
of
a
novelty
than
anything
else
worth
a
try
but
nothing
special
if
anyone
has
this
beer
please
beer
mail
me
i
am
willing
to
barter
in
order
to
get
this
beer
again
i
live
in
ohio
so
great
lakes
thirsty
dog
and
may
even
be
able
to
venture
to
penn
to
get
something
if
need
be
sort
of
your
typical
porter
heavy
on
the
chocolate
flavors
its
a
good
porter
on
its
own
even
if
it
doesnt
have
any
unique
seaweed
characteristics
recommended
a
most
interesting
beer
this
one
and
this
brewery
definately
has
a
habit
of
producing
interesting
beersthis
beer
pours
a
coca
cola
colour
with
little
carbonation
and
leaves
a
little
head
not
even
half
a
fingerwhen
smelling
this
beer
i
can
definately
smell
the
sea
with
roasted
malty
backnotes
quite
interestingit
tastes
just
like
a
stout
only
lighter
with
a
real
unfull
mouthfeel
but
definately
quite
smooth
going
down
and
suprisingly
enough
i
quite
like
this
ale
ill
definately
be
chasing
down
their
other
beers
when
i
see
them
next
due
to
a
lack
of
glassware
i
drank
this
out
of
a
wine
glass
that
was
refilled
several
times
it
has
a
lovely
dark
brown
color
with
little
head
and
carbonation
the
scent
is
rather
unique
it
reminds
me
greek
olives
and
a
little
bit
of
ocean
air
just
the
saltiness
i
guess
though
since
its
flavored
with
seaweed
that
makes
sense
the
flavor
is
a
lot
like
other
darker
beers
not
as
rich
as
a
barleywine
or
stout
but
with
a
lot
more
flavor
and
weight
than
say
anchor
steam
im
still
not
quite
up
to
my
beer
knowledge
to
be
able
to
pick
everything
out
but
the
flavor
does
have
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
to
it
and
in
some
ways
reminds
me
of
the
brine
of
olives
even
though
that
might
just
be
because
of
the
scent
it
felt
nice
in
my
mouth
a
thick
feel
without
too
much
carbonation
easy
to
drink
its
different
unique
and
maybe
not
something
id
like
a
lot
of
in
one
sitting
but
my
one
500ml
bottle
pretty
nice
serving
size
especially
since
this
particular
booze
is
weaker
than
i
typically
drink
i
wouldnt
drink
several
in
one
night
but
i
would
buy
it
again
d
i
was
surprised
to
detect
very
little
character
from
the
seaweed
this
is
by
far
the
most
drinkable
of
the
gruits
made
by
heather
ale
overall
it
comes
across
as
a
nice
stout
with
an
unusual
hard
to
identify
earthy
quality
a
drinkable
gruit
what
a
novelty
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
carbonated
and
dry
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
beer
is
very
different
the
seaweed
is
present
but
not
over
powering
it
is
a
rather
different
beer
but
it
is
not
too
bad
smells
like
ocean
and
tastes
like
ocean
coming
from
a
guy
who
loves
the
beach
and
beer
trust
me
you
can
skip
this
one
just
go
to
the
beach
and
grab
a
corona
conclusion
this
brewery
just
doesnt
seem
to
know
how
to
brew
a
bad
beer
i
mean
you
see
seaweed
ale
on
a
bottle
and
youre
probably
terrified
the
mineraly
ocean
like
notes
are
very
very
mild
and
under
that
is
a
fantastic
dark
ale
that
has
complexity
and
drinkability
written
all
over
it
good
job
to
heather
ale
ltd
on
another
outstanding
scottish
beer
final
thoughts
at
5
a
bottle
it
is
certainly
worth
trying
beyond
the
initial
unique
experience
i
dont
see
a
point
in
revisiting
this
one
overall
not
what
i
expected
if
i
had
not
read
the
label
i
would
not
have
appreciated
the
seaweed
most
likely
good
beer
overall
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
onefinger
of
tan
head
the
retention
was
pretty
good
especially
as
a
collar
and
the
lacing
was
decent
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malt
a
green
mustiness
surely
the
seaweed
wild
coffee
and
a
light
spiciness
the
flavors
were
full
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
light
peat
smoke
coffee
biscuity
malt
a
bit
of
saltiness
and
a
semibitter
finish
of
hops
the
aftertaste
did
indeed
have
seaweed
in
it
and
goddamn
was
it
weird
it
is
to
be
noted
i
awarded
rather
than
withdrew
points
for
this
weirdness
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
supposed
to
taste
like
that
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
mediumlight
easy
to
drink
and
similar
to
an
english
porter
only
more
herbal
and
well
odd
but
i
totally
think
its
worth
a
try
and
did
enjoy
it
the
beer
is
very
intriguing
challenging
and
surreal
the
lack
of
hops
make
balance
and
complexity
difficult
if
you
like
the
scottish
malty
beers
then
youll
find
a
lot
of
enjoyment
here
by
the
way
i
didnt
get
anything
in
the
beer
that
even
hinted
at
seaweed
t
m
d
taste
is
very
interesting
it
tastes
basically
like
a
typical
english
style
porter
with
the
addition
of
a
slightly
sour
slightly
salty
but
still
slight
chinese
candy
taste
there
is
a
strong
amount
of
bitterness
past
midpalate
it
coats
the
mouth
decently
but
has
a
watery
quality
that
starts
midpalate
along
with
the
appearance
of
the
bitter
sour
salty
tastes
since
it
reminds
me
so
much
of
a
porter
i
am
having
trouble
deciding
if
i
really
like
its
differences
or
if
it
has
problems
meeting
my
expectations
i
guess
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
cannot
mark
it
down
for
having
some
distinctive
nonporter
tastes
since
it
is
intentionally
an
herbed
beer
it
is
kind
of
weird
though
i
can
see
drinking
this
again
and
enjoying
it
but
its
not
for
quaffing
overall
i
was
expecting
more
this
to
me
is
an
average
beer
made
with
a
different
ingrediant
md
the
palate
is
smooth
enough
but
is
always
backed
by
decent
carbonation
to
buttress
the
medium
body
while
in
the
end
of
each
deep
sip
the
palate
does
goes
slightly
thin
maybe
due
to
the
semisour
aftertaste
overall
this
seaweed
ale
tastes
really
like
a
mediumbodied
stout
to
me
with
but
a
wee
touch
of
seabreezy
saltiness
at
the
tail
pleasantly
drinkable
not
bad
but
black
cullin
is
a
better
example
of
this
style
of
dark
scottish
beer
d
really
surprised
by
this
brewed
with
actual
seaweed
in
mash
tun
gives
this
a
salty
beach
like
feel
that
is
pulled
off
really
nicely
would
definitely
recommend
for
something
different
this
brew
pours
up
a
dark
brown
color
with
crimson
edges
and
a
big
bubbly
dark

the
nose
is
chocolate

smokey
aroma
the
taste
is
subtle
chocolate
earth
smokey
subtle

due
to
the

assume
medium

low
carbo
a
smoothe

good
amount
of
flavour
for
the
abv
and
worth
a
try
very
drinkable
easy
to
down
brew
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
and
was
a
little
let
down
pours
the
deepest
of
brown
colors
with
an
average
dense
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
a
very
nice
rich
nuttymilk
chocolate
malt
though
i
am
not
picking
up
any
seaweed
like
aromas
this
is
one
malty
beverage
big
nutty

flavor
some
milk
chocolate
and
just
a
hint
of
sea
salt
or
seaweed
this
is
one
good

out
of
the
4

the
feel
is

all
adds
up
to
a
brew
that
you
can
drink
all

drinkability
well
worth
a
try
excellent
in
the
late
fallwinter
months
could
easily
drink
a
6pack
nothing
to
be
intimidated
by
the
unusual
ingredient
in
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
a
porter
or
stout
nice
low
abv
for
a
robust
flavored
beer
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
an
okay
beer
i
feel
ultimately
disappointed
i
was
stoked
try
a
beer
brewed
with
seaweed
but
it
really
has
such
a
nominal
effect
that
it
goes
virtually
unnoticed
bummer
for
what
it
is
theres
a
number
of
other
better
beers
namely
porters
that
are
preferable
to
this
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
id
love
to
taste
a
version
of
this
made
without
seaweed
to
see
how
much
the
seaweed
contributes
to
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
worth
a
shot
most
of
all
because
there
are
not
a
whole
lot
of
other
beers
that
can
claim
to
use
seaweed
in
the
brewing
process
and
only
4
4
alcohol
by
volume
seaweed
beer
interesting
well
it
has
a
cola
color
with
a
light
brown
inch
and
a
half
tall
head
that
recedes
but
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
smells
lightly
of
roasted
malt
tastes
again
roasty
a
bit
of
chocolate
hopcarbonation
tingles
a
bit
and
finishes
with
a
slightly
salty
creamy
oily
feeling
with
slight
smokelight
coffee
bitterness
very
interesting
worth
a
try
for
the
novelty
factor
alone
d
easy
to
drink
would
go
good
on
a
hot
day
despite
the
dark
malts
used
this
is
an
easyflowing
ale
very
interesting
ill
definitely
seek
out
another
im
confused
did
it
improve
with
age
or
is
this
weird

actually

with

the
aroma
is
very
similar
to
a

with

the
taste
like
the
aroma
features
dark

and
hints
of
chocolate

comes
across

a

overall
kelpie
seaweed
ale
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
there
is
nothing
that
really
stands
out
to
make
me
want
to
purchase
again
i
was
expecting
something
to
be
different
about
this
beer
considering
it
was
brewed
with
seaweed
but
i
really
did
not
notice
any
effect
earthy
and
smooth
with
a
medium
body
im
getting
a
tad
bit
of
salty
notes
but
not
tasting
any
seaweed
it
has
more
of
a
light
porter
characteristic
or
a
brown
ale
the
flavors
are
pretty
cool
and
its
tasting
different
whether
i
drink
a
little
sip
or
a
bigger
mouthfull
a
rather
complex
and
interesting
brew
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
its
certainly
a
unique
beer
and
its
not
too
bad
but
im
not
sure
that
id
really
want
to
drink
it
again
drinkability
an
excellent
and
unexpected
beverage
who
would
have
thought
seaweed
the
scottish
thats
who
pours
out
a
deep
dark
brown
with
some
rubyviolet
edges
when
held
to
the
light
head
is
like
frothy
cafe
au
lait
and
maintains
very
well
to
me
this
is
reminiscent
of
a
solid
stoutporter
with
good
chocolate
roast
and
fruity
qualities
if
i
wasnt
told
this
had
kelp
in
it
i
wouldnt
notice
probably
although
it
does
have
a
mineral
thing
going
on
flavor
starts
off
with
some
roasted
grain
and
light
chocolate
in
the
middle
there
is
that
mineral
presence
again
along
with
some
raisin
finishes
very
dry
and
with
a
touch
of
saltiness
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
on
the
palate
but
manages
to
not
be
thin
very
creamy
feel
to
it
really
drinkable
with
the
low
abv
and
the
refreshingly
drying
character
it
has
eric
on
a
final
note
approach
this
as
you
would
a
schwarzbier
as
its
very
dark
but
smooth
and
not
that
bitter
drinkability
not
very
common
beer
in
the
scottish
gruit
style
very
dark
brown
almost
black
porterlike
appearance
with
a
very
light
tan
head
cream
colored
aromas
of
roasted
malt
a
faint
hint
of
cocoa
and
a
dash
of
rum
flavors
of
roasted
malt
mildest
cocoa
and
a
faint
hint
of
salt
kelp
between
medium
and
full
body
with
a
roasty
and
ohsomildly
seaweed
finish
this
could
be
a
beverage
for
scottish
infants
getting
trained
for
future
single
malt
scotch
all
in
all
i
was
glad
i
revisted
this
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
porter
or
stout
drinkers
who
are
in
search
of
somthing
a
little
less
filling
with
a
twist
to
the
brewing
technique
pours
a
dark
brown
that
shows
a
little
bit
of
light
no
head
roasted
coffee
nose
with
some
brown
sugar
in
there
as
well
flavor
is
just
the
same
like
roasted
coffee
character
not
really
getting
any
seaweed
on
here
at
all
well
bodied
but
there
is
some
minor
aspect
about
it
that
seems
a
bit
thin
nice
biting
and
pretty
full
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinker
almost
comes
off

i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
w
the
name
seaweed
ale
but
i
was
suprised
it
tastes
more
like
a
porter
or
a
bock
than
a
scottish
gruit
very
good
over
all
i
would
definatly
recommend
it
to
anyone
worth
a
try
for
sure
earthy
musty
and
sweet
reminded
me
of
a
quality
schwarzbier
dark
roasted
flavors
bode
well
for
the
beer
but
it
never
becomes
too
thick
or
heavy
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
d
definitely
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
was
gonna
be
fortunately
the
seaweed
played
a
really
mild
roll
beers
a
bit
thin
and
could
use
some
more
body
ok
but
nothing
special
pours
an
excellent
dark
black

very
opaque
has
a
good

nice

a

great

a
nice

bold

a
great

well
a
nice

of
bitter
and
sweet
leaning
towards
the
bitter
side
great
hin
of
seaweed
in
the
aftertaste
in
a
good
way
goes
down
fine
perhaps
a
bit
on
the
rough
side
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
this
type
of
beer
it
wont
be
my
favorite
but
it
will
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
occasionally
recommended
for
novelty
purposes
only
d
i
was
sort
of
hoping
the
seaweed
wasnt
too
strong
but
if
someone
poured
you
this
youd
say
it
was
a
porter
worth
trying
but
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
d
to
astringent
for
more
than
the
12
bottle
i
shared
d
this
beer
has
some
dark
malt
flavors
but
the
most
memorable
part
is
the
watery
texture
smell
and
taste
i
was
expecting
some
note
of
seaweed
or
something
of
interest
it
does
have
some
weak
bock
notes
but
not
enough
to
make
me
want
another
glass
kelpie
seaweed
ale
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thick
tan
colored
head
from
a
brown
500
ml
bottle
the
aroma
is
mostly
chocolate
malt
the
taste
is
a
lot
like
a
watered
down
stout
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
are
very
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
would
be
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
stout
however
i
cant
say
the
seaweed
is
noticeable
in
any
way
but
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
for
the
price
it
would
be
a
great
session
beer
recommended
overall
recommended
would
make
for
an
interesting
sessions
beer
high
flavor
and
low
alcohol
nice
not
just
a
novelty
beer
this
brew
has
enough
going
on
in
a
good
way
to
be
worth
trying
due
to
its
porterstout
like
roastiness
its
certainly
not
going
to
appeal
much
to
the
bmc
drinker
but
this
is
an
interesting
ale
that
would
have
some
appeal
to
those
who
like
their
beers
dark
or
are
looking
to
get
into
darker
brews
glad
i
tried
this
one
and
ill
be
drinking
it
again
some
day
the
beer
is
a
dark
rather
flat
uncarbonated
mixture
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
or
real
retention
the
smell
is
average
chocolatey
or
coffeeish
and
does
have
an
alcohol
tinge
to
it
the
low
abv
makes
the
smell
a
little
deceiving
on
that
score
the
taste
is
very
mellow
a
bit
watery
sweet
chocolate
raisin
coffee
the
high
point
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
very
smooth
and
very
mellow
there
are
no
real
hops
notes
in
this
beer
its
all
malt
some
grassiness
and
no
real
after
taste
after
the
beer
warms
a
bit
there
is
a
very
slight
hop
bitterness
coming
through
at
the
very
end
that
something
extra
in
the
flavor
is
the
seaweed
i
assume
and
if
anything
perhaps
the
seaweed
has
an
ameliorating
effect
that
smooths
out
the
mouthfeel
and
the
aftertaste
but
im
making
some
assumptions
here
the
beer
is
interesting
and
worth
exploring
lchaim
the
beer
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
light
fullness
to
it
that
belies
the
level
of
sweetness
in
this
brew
the
beer
has
notes
of
coffee
in
the
finish
toasted
grain
perhaps
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
a
soft
saltiness
that
could
be
from
the
malt
but
i
would
hope
was
from
the
seaweed
the
seaweed
certainly
does
not
leave
a
signature
taste
in
this
brew
or
at
least
one
that
i
can
taste
this
is
actually
a
bit
dissapointing
for
that
reason

very
dark
reddish

nearly
black
moderate
creamy
tan
head
aroma
of
dark
malts
and
something
undefinable
strange
which
i
guess
is
the
seaweed
moderate
carbonation
smooth
mouthfeel
the
flavour
has
moderate
roasted
malts
and
very
moderate
hops
and
again
but
this
time
very
moderate
strange
sidenotes
which
must
be
the
seaweed
the
beer
is
definitely
drinkable
but
im
still
not
convinced
that
adding
seaweed
as
an
ingredient
in
beer
is
a
particularly
brilliant
idea
has
a
very
interesting

also

with

finish
is

but
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
ale
smooth
and
distinctive
notes
i
tend
to
like
this
style
ive
had
maybe
10
ancient
herbed
ales
and
i
can
only
remember
one
that
i
truly
didnt
like
the
herbs
and
spices
combine
with
some
meaty
malts
to
make
this
very
interesting

my
summation
of

like
a

with

the

can

leaves

is

o
im
going
to
assume
i
got
a
bad
bottle
because
mine
was
nothing
like
the
last
few
reviews
i
have
read
here
i
let
three
other
people
sample
this
as
well
one
said
it
tasted
like
rubbing
alcohol
and
i
agreed
another
said
it
tasted
like
medicine
agree
again
very
disappointing
since
i
am
half
scottish
and
really
wanted
this
to
be
great
i
realize
it
is
an
old
timey
recipe
and
that
taste
wasnt
much
of
an
issue
in
viking
days
but
nowadays
it
is
and
this
didnt
have
much
to
recommend
it
still
as
is
i
could
imagine
roughhewn
vikings
and
picts
around
a
roaring
bonfire
on
the
north
coast
of
scotland
in
the
ninth
century
passing
around
a
measure
of
this
and
having
a
high
old
time
but
ill
try
to
find
another
bottle
to
revisit
this
o
as
a
hop
head
in
search
of
the
ultimate
hop
bomb
with
ibus
through
the
roof
i
found
this
brew
from
across
the
pond
brewed
without
hops
at
all
spruce
and
pine
provide
the
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
malt
backbone
very
interesting
and
different
check
this
out
some
thought
went
into
it
a
reddish
brown
body
with
light
carbonation
and
a
thin
white
head
nice
lace
very
sweet
smell
earthy
and
fruity
smells
like
pine
needles
and
apples
with
alcohol
and
malt
characteristics
underneath
very
crisp
burnt
smell
caramelized
says
on
the
bottle
to
enjoy
at
room
temperature
so
thats
what
im
doing
bringing
out
some
very
deep
flavors
the
malt
bitterness
at
the
end
balances
out
the
fruity
and
sweet
apple
like
beginning
with
warming
alcohol
in
the
middle
very
bready
medium
bodied
fairly
drinkable
a
warming
treat
good
for
a
winter
afternoon
so
i
may
have
bought
an
old
bottle
but
i
think
it
was
pretty
good
overall
enjoyable
beer
not
something
i
would
purchase
regularly
but
worth
giving
a
try
to
not
quite
as
good
as
the
elderberry
beer
but
better
than
the
heather
beer
in
my
mind
overall
very
nice
mix
of
flavors
easy
to
drink
a
great
fall
session
beer
for
the
pit
fire
o
eh
boring
to
be
fair
this
isnt
a
very
fresh
bottle
but
i
cant
see
this
one
being
fantastic
fresh
worth
trying
a
single
for
the
novelty
o
well
above
average
im
excited
to
drink
the
other
crazy
gruits
in
my
fridge
tasty
not
terribly
complex
with
a
hint
of
the
spruce
very
interesting
an
initial
malty
pine
flavor
gave
way
to
a
somewhat
bitter
and
boozy
bite
at
the
end
not
unpleasant
just
different
the
label
states
that
this
should
be
consumed
at
room
temperature
and
like
a
fool
i
didnt
read
it
and
i
put
it
in
the
icebox
i
suspect
the
flavor
would
be
much
more
complex
at
room
temp
not
an
easy
drinker
but
a
good
one
tastes
delicious
very
malty
sweet
but
the
woody
pinespruce
infusion
adds
an
entirely
different
profile
to
this
brew
i
would
gladly
buy
more
of
these
if
they
were
more
widely
available
probably
the
most
striking
attribute
of
this
beer
would
be
the
appearance
hazy
copper
with
a
nearly
perfect
foamy
creme
colored
head
oddly
virtually
no
lacing
the
aroma
immediately
took
me
to
a
direction
i
wasnt
expecting
from
something
called
pine
this
thing
smells
balls
on
like
a
barleywine
no
difference
at
all
taste
immediately
goes
the
barleywine
route
sweet
malty
goodness
until
from
out
of
nowhere
a
pungent
tartness
pops
up
the
finish
is
just
a
touch
tinny
with
a
slight
bitterness
lingering
body
overall
goes
from
creamy
to
thin
by
the
finish
overall
its
quite
different
and
a
good
departure
from
pretty
much
anything
else
but
not
something
you
can
really
throw
down
in
any
quantity
overall
glad
i
finally
tried
this
interesting
for
sure
probably
not
something
id
go
to
great
lengths
to
try
again
mainly
due
to
the
aftertaste
it
just
kicks
around
too
long
overall
this
is
okay
a
bit
of
a
sipper
and
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
im
begining
to
not
like
international
gruit
day
wishing
it
was
stout
or
ipa
day
instead
pours
a
clear
medium
copper
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
musters
quickly
then
leaves
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
sugary
caramel
and
lightly
fruity
aroma
i
wouldnt
call
it
pine
but
there
is
a
strange
aroma
deep
underneath
that
defies
all
out
detection
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
lots
of
residual
sugar
mixed
with
a
light
sweet
and
almost
tart
fruit
little
to
no
pine
or
hop
flavor
but
there
is
a
light
herbal
quality
to
this
elixir
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
almost
syrupy
mouthfeel
nice
beer
very
flavorful
easy
to
drink
and
just
a
hint
different
appearance
is
a
cloudy
brownish
liquid
with
no
visible
carbonation
nor
head
aroma
is
sweet
herbs
chamomile
like
taste
is
unexpectedly
mild
not
the
bitter
bite
i
would
imagine
a
brew
made
with
evergreen
needles
to
have
actually
delicious
mild
warming
mouthfeel
drunk
as
suggested
at
room
temperature
from
a
goblet
o
a
unique
brew
that
hits
the
tripel
notes
though
i
wouldve
enjoyed
a
touch
more
on
the
pine
notes
worth
a
try
and
definitely
unique
but
not
certain
i
would
try
it
again
overall
being
that
its
not
exactly
a
popular
style
or
something
i
have
a
ton
of
experience
on
this
one
its
hard
to
place
this
one
still
its
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
are
interested
in
some
of
the
more
obscure
styles
as
well
as
the
more
traditional
ones
it
wouldnt
be
something
id
be
rushing
back
for
although
its
definitely
an
interesting
beer
to
try
final
grade
4
05
an
impressive
a
alba
scots
pine
ale
is
an
interesting
brew
if
nothing
else
i
happen
to
like
piney
tastes
which
as
a
hophead
probably
isnt
all
that
surprising
so
it
stands
to
reason
that
i
would
probably
like
a
wellexecuted
pinespruce
beer
its
just
complex
enough
to
keep
me
interested
without
being
especially
overwhelming
and
the
bodydensity
of
the
beer
works
perfectly
with
the
ethanol
this
would
actually
be
a
really
great
warmer
for
the
fall
and
winter
months
assuming
i
could
find
it
reliably
definitely
worth
a
try
definitely
not
a
runofthemill
beer
this
works
on
quite
a
few
levels
it
is
an
interesting
beer
and
the
pinespruce
character
is
welldone
and
pretty
balanced
give
it
a
try
worth
the
experience
overall
an
interesting
experiment
worth
a
try
if
interesting
in
historical
brewing
or
curious
about
spruce
beers
like
many
hybridspecialty
styles
it
is
well
worth
a
try
but
doesnt
rise
to
the
level
of
something
you
feel
you
want
to
keep
on
hand
or
introduce
all
your
friends
to
overall
its
hard
to
evaluate
something
like
this
as
theres
little
frame
of
reference
notwithstanding
its
a
beer
that
in
my
opinion
is
dramatically
unsessionable
its
very
aggressive
on
the
palate
but
not
in
the
sense
that
its
challenging
also
the
relatively
higher
alcohol
astringency
spiciness
and
cloying
sweetness
makes
for
an
uninviting
beer
having
all
of
that
been
said
however
its
still
an
inspired
attempt
at
an
historical
style
few
brewers
dared
to
take
a
chance
at
and
that
has
to
be
taken
into
account
pours
a
dark
amber
inch
head
fine
lacing
scent
of
plum
caramel
and
yeast
taste
follows
the
nose
quite
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
had
imagined
it
tastes
to
me
like
some
odd
candy
a
bit
of
apricot
a
bit
of
melon
and
plum
come
to
mind
then
a
bit
of
roasted
maltiness
and
a
hint
of
mineral
in
the
background
very
well
balanced
thick
mouthfeel
not
a
challening
beer
at
all
and
very
easy
to
enjoy
id
absolutely
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
more
sweet
and
overall
crowdpleasing
brew
while
still
retaining
complexity
and
balance
wouldnt
make
overall
loved
this
glad
i
tried
it
a
good
surprise
overall
not
something
i
would
buy
again
but
it
was
another
weird
example
of
what
you
can
do
with
ancient
recipes
it
really
wasnt
that
bad
once
you
got
over
the
herbal
tree
sap
quality
medium
carbonation
giving
a
nice
tingling
on
the
tongue
with
a
medium
body
interesting
beer
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
330

pours
lightly

with

12

dense
off

head
with
good
retention
that

to
a
nice

that
lingers
some
decent
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
orange
grape
apple

herbal

with

fairly
creamy
and
slick

that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
small

noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
herbed
ale
nice
balance
and
flavor
complexity
and
quite
smooth
to
drink
very
tasty
o
an
interesting
beer
liked
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
o
this
is
tasty
but
almost
too
sweet
i
did
not
get
any
of
the
pint
others
have
noted
that
may
have
helped
the
balance
somewhat
overall
this
is
an
interesting
style
to
try
and
doesnt
taste
all
too
bad
but
after
about
10
minutes
the
sweetness
of
it
is
making
me
nauseous
plus
it
makes
me
think
of
vikings
and
that
just
makes
it
a
little
extra
awesome
o
really
interesting
perhaps
got
a
bit
cloying
with
the
sweetness
and
spruce
at
the
end
but
a
very
interesting
combination
of
flavors
overall
pretty
good
nice
fruit
and
berry
profile
and
not
over
the
top
with
added
spices
very
floral
and
earthy
hop
profile
balanced
well
with
some
added
sugars
worth
a
drink
for
sure
aside
from
the
bright
copper
color
decent
fluffy
head
and
fruity
aroma
this
beer
is
frighteningly
terrible
rare
is
the
day
that
ill
dump
a
beer
down
the
drain
after
only
two
sips
but
this
was
one
of
those
days
if
youve
ever
eaten
an
old
cantaloupe
youll
know
how
this
beer
tastes
and
feels
rotten
and
slippery
i
literally
gagged
no
wonder
the
vikings
vanished
notes
well
this
is
interesting
the
sweetness
is
a
little
complex
but
it
still
remains
balanced
overall
a
rather
tasty
beer
cheers
certainly
a
unique
style
my
first
of
the
kind
that
im
actually
paying
attention
to
not
bad
but
i
feel
like
theres
something
id
always
choose
over
it
im
sure
it
fits
someones
niche
and
is
a
nice
one
to
try
this
is
a
smooth
beer
that
i
would
buy
agian
and
could
see
me
drinking
sitting
inside
relaxin
buy
the
fire
if
i
had
a
fire
place
poured
a
peachy
red
with
only
a
thin
layer
of
head
even
with
a
substantially
aggressive
pour
some
sparse
bubbles
kinda
resembles
a
cask
pour
nose
isnt
distinctly
pine
some
fruity
notes
and
sweet
caramel
and
maybe
something
herbal
in
there
but
not
distinctly
so
taste
has
more
caramel
berries
and
herbal
qualities
cant
say
the
spruce
or
pine
sticks
out
again
but
there
are
herbal
leanings
here
again
bready
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
carbonation
is
medium
and
the
alcohol
stings
a
bit
as
it
goes
down
above
average
but
wouldve
liked
to
have
had
the
advertised
focus
of
this
beer
to
be
more
prominent
its
pretty
funny
that
ive
had
all
of
the
historic
ales
but
have
never
reviewed
any
except
the
kelpie
seaweed
ale
this
came
as
one
of
four
in
the
gift
pack
for
9
99
not
a
bad
deal
totally
different
beers
than
your
mainstream
offerings
appears
a
pale
ruby
copper
hue
with
a
bright
off
white
head
maybe
a
light
khaki
tone
fine
sparse
lacing
scattered
on
the
sides
of
my
chalice
surprisingly
a
malt
heavy
nose
with
little
to
no
pine
aromatics
very
fruity
bright
cherry
ripened
with
some
earthiness
and
a
bit
of
noticeable
alcohol
as
it
warms
it
begins
to
unleash
more
of
the
pine
character
in
the
nose
flavor
wise
it
starts
out
super
fruity
with
hints
of
cherry
coated
in
sugar
in
a
reduction
and
finishes
bitter
with
pineherbalmint
notes
really
balanced
compared
to
most
spruce
tippine
beers
ive
tasted
finishes
with
a
moderate
dryness
little
heat
from
the
alcohol
but
the
flavor
is
there
in
an
almost
medicinal
nature
with
the
fruity
cherry
notes
carbonation
is
assertive
but
not
overdone
and
body
is
definitely
medium
with
a
light
reduced
sugar
near
syrup
texture
overall
a
solid
beer
that
i
could
offer
up
to
somebody
new
to
the
beer
scene
and
it
would
come
off
both
new
and
interesting
for
me
this
is
more
or
less
a
mass
produced
version
of
something
yards
brewing
as
made
exteme
and
craft
d
probably
the
most
complex
gruit
ive
had
but
also
probably
the
most
accessible
in
that
its
rather
like
a
spiced
strong
ale
definitely
worth
seeking
out
slightly
hazy
copper
colour
one
finger
of
white
head
light
lacing
smell
is
pretty
malty
and
cereal
like
earthy
with
a
very
faint
pine
smell
light
alcohol
as
well
taste
is
biscuity
malt
upfront
mildly
bitter
forest
berries
forest
like
notes
but
not
necessarily
pine
more
berry
and
forest
flavours
in
the
finish
medium
carbonation
medium
body
pretty
decent
feel
this
was
ok
at
best
would
have
liked
more
pine
flavours
and
scents
in
this
fairly
boring
stuff
this
is
one
of
the
best
herbedfloral
beers
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
its
very
drinkable
and
has
almost
no
trace
of
its
abv
i
could
see
myself
buying
a
lot
of
it
were
it
available
outside
of
the
historic
ales
of
scotland
gift
pack
in
which
i
found
it
a
really
enjoyable
brew
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise
the
pine
is
not
over
done
and
adds
to
the
complexity
definitely
worth
having
again
this
was
a
real
quality
beer
very
good
aromas
and
really
well
balanced
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
complexity
took
me
by
surprise
not
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
o
i
like
and
would
recommend
you
pick
this
up
as
well
a
full
flavored
quite
easy
drinking
pine
ale
that
i
enjoyed
can
envision
my
scottish
and
swedish
ancestors
kicking
back
and
enjoying
this
style
4
reccomended
to
fans
of
fullflavoured
rich
beer
alba
scots
pine
ale
is
about
as
unique
and
tastefilled
as
they
come
o
i
am
very
impressed
by
this
ale
i
wish
i
had
purchased
a
full
6
pack
so
i
could
investigate
it
further
it
seems
to
grow
and
change
with
every
sip
i
take
i
didnt
expect
much
and
i
got
blown
away
well
done
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
decent
brew
and
much
more
beer
like
than
a
lot
of
other
gruits
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
nothing
i
would
seek
out
all
the
time
but
an
enjoyable
change
of
pace
o
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
a
bit
too
easy
to
drink
id
have
again
very
fruity
not
what
i
expected
everything
worked
together
and
the
complexity
assures
youll
taste
new
things
everytime
you
drink
this
overall
this
is
a
unique
brew
and
a
nice
option
when
looking
for
something
different
not
a
beery
beer
and
it
presents
a
different
kind
of
pine
than
hops
i
think
the
spruce
adds
a
nice
twist
i
think
this
would
make
for
a
good
holiday
brew
with
some
more
spices
and
darker
malts
this
is
a
pleasant
approachable
pine
ale
nothing
very
intimidating
or
overwhelming
here
i
am
surprised
a
how
drinkable
this
is
though
considering
he
abv
t
caramel
and
malt
upfront
with
a
very
strange
flavor
or
must
and
wet
dog
chew
toy
mixed
with
oak
really
strange
flavor
i
was
not
exactly
a
fan
of
this
one
medium
bodied
nicely
balanced
and
suprisingly
tasty
a
bit
too
sweet
and
cidry
to
hit
it
off
with
me
o
good
for
one
or
two
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
d
really
solid
brew
if
this
is
a
remnant
of
a
recipe
that
my
ancestors
drank
its
no
wonder
i
have
a
taste
for
better
beer
o
really
tasty
stuff
really
really
good
so
wellbalanced
with
all
the
flavors
integrated
well
and
no
notes
out
of
place
very
impressed
overall
great
would
love
to
have
more
the
beer
pours
out
as
a
golden
copper
color
with
a
pretty
good
looking
head
at
first
the
head
doesnt
really
last
too
long
but
does
leave
a
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
very
nice
aroma
of
fresh
pine
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
decent
malt
base
with
a
really
interesting
pine
flavor
i
really
liked
that
its
actually
pine
and
not
hops
giving
off
a
pine
essence
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
and
had
a
little
bit
of
a
creaminess
to
it
overall
i
love
the
history
behind
this
beer
its
got
some
really
nice
flavors
in
it
and
i
try
to
get
a
bottle
of
it
every
time
i
get
down
to
the
braveheart
in
hellertown
picked
this
up
at
the
biggest
beer
store
in
the
uk
beers
of
europe
ltd
clear
copperamber
pour
with
two
finger
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
super
unique
herbal
sweet
nose
thats
dominated
by
fresh
spruce
with
a
hint
of
grape
soda
the
herbal
taste
is
super
unique
as
well
very
malty
and
sweet
with
tons
of
spruce
and
a
little
bit
of
rosemary
as
well
the
7
5
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
making
this
really
drinkable
especially
for
as
sweet
as
it
is
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
chewy
but
in
a
good
way
with
a
nice
tangy
herbal
finish
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
medieval
beer
i
had
at
gruut
in
ghent
belgium
definitely
want
to
try
some
more
from
this
brewery
time
for
a
road
trip
to
scotland
better
than
i
anticipated
in
all
ways
poured
a
3
flaxen
colored
head
which
slowley
dissipated
lovely
clear
amber
color
smells
of
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
pine
taste
has
malt
caramel
and
a
very
mild
pine
and
a
moderate
sweetness
id
wondered
if
this
would
be
ipa
like
and
its
not
nearly
strong
enough
but
the
flavors
are
clean
it
has
a
nice
smooth
body
and
its
quite
enjoyable
at
room
temperature
as
the
label
suggests
however
at
least
to
me
the
beer
seemed
to
taste
less
interesting
than
it
smelled
certainly
good
but
not
great
i
noticed
fewer
of
the
floral
or
pine
notes
than
i
had
expected
and
looked
forward
to
i
would
certainly
consider
trying
this
beer
again
though
and
next
time
will
take
the
advice
on
the
bottle
which
i
only
read
after
consuming
to
serve
this
beer
at
room
temp
it
was
a
wednesday
evening
in
johnstown
for
work
so
where
would
one
go
for
great
beer
selection
tulunes
of
course
first
beer
this
evening
was
alba
scots
pine
ale
recommended
by
the
bar
keep
the
color
was
a
cloudy
amber
with
decent
white
head
but
no
lace
the
aroma
was
strong
with
pine
and
spice
the
taste
was
equally
dominated
by
pine
and
sprig
they
must
have
used
a
sweet
malt
because
it
helped
to
balance
the
strong
pine
flavor
and
elevated
abv
in
addition
to
giving
it
a
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
lil
to
sweet
for
me
only
one
would
do
me
fine
pours
a
very
clear
amberish
copper
color
with
a
thick
eggshell
head
and
a
good
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malts
spices
and
candied
fruits
tastes
of
some
sweet
cherry
sweet
malts
nutmeg
and
brown
sugar
and
maybe
some
spruce
or
maple
sap
notes
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
lively
carbonation
overall
it
isnt
a
a
bad
beer
i
felt
it
was
much
much
too
sweet
and
malty
for
my
taste
i
like
a
little
more
than
just
untamed
sweetness
nothing
about
this
beer
betrays
the
fact
that
its
brewed
with
pine
rather
than
hops
still
a
solid
amber
ale
wow
overall
i
could
just
pound
this
back
all
night
from
the
cask
never
had
anything
like
this
before
this
was
a
great
experience
good
start
for
me
for
this
style
not
sure
about
this
one
strange
brew
but
mostly
in
a
good
sense
d
very
drinkable
fruity
pleasant
with
a
peculiar
earthiness
one
hopes
to
get
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
muted
recommended
if
youre
looking
for
something
new
you
know
its
funny
that
i
loved
this
beer
so
much
yet
im
having
a
tough
time
establishing
specifically
why
i
suppose
the
sublime
cannot
be
reduced
to
words
pours
a
really
nice
ruby
orange
with
a
onefinger
white
head
smells
of
fresh
mixed
berries
and
a
hint
of
pine
flavor
pretty
much
follows
really
good
but
not
overpowering
sweet
berry
flavor
to
start
the
berries
are
obviously
present
but
subtle
at
the
same
time
some
mild
pine
hops
follow
and
mix
well
before
some
more
sweet
malt
to
finish
interesting
this
is
only
the
2nd
of
the
assorted
4
pack
i
got
i
liked
the
heather
ale
better
but
this
is
good
overall
it
sounds
odd
but
was
pretty
decent
d
this
beer
is
an
easy
drinking
interesting
beer
that
i
would
look
for
again
but
wouldnt
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
overall
its
been
my
favorite
williams
brothers
brewery
beer
to
date
well
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
especially
given
its
historical
brewing
traditions
drink
well
as
advertised
this
beer
really
tastes
like
pine
pine
is
not
something
i
really
enjoy
drinking
this
is
a
beer
that
falls
into
the
category
of
im
happy
i
tried
it
but
wont
be
having
it
again
quite
nice
especially
if
you
follow
the
bottles
advice
and
have
it
at
room
temperature
in
a
goblet
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
a
faint
white
head
not
much
head
retention
and
fades
into
a
small
ring
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
great
lacing
as
i
swirl
it
around
my
tulip
glass
aroma
is
very
malt
forward
with
some
pineyearthy
notes
the
flavor
is
also
very
malt
forward
but
with
a
bigger
floralearthy
backbone
pine
spruce
flavors
definitely
come
through
in
the
finish
moderate
carbonation
and
slightly
watery
body
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
earthy
notes
really
start
to
come
out
i
would
definitely
seek
this
beer
out
on
my
own
very
enjoyable
d
very
interesting
flavor
kind
of
like
earthy
ipa
hint
of
fruitfloral
give
this
beer
a
try
the
style
intrigues
and
nice
to
see
something
different
out
there
i
thought
this
beer
would
be
hard
to
get
down
or
too
odd
but
it
just
works
could
have
a
few
i
think
ill
pass
on
the
wassail
tonight
cos
this
beer
is
more
that
appropriate
a
primitive
but
delicate
blend
of
honey
caramel
pine
needles
and
some
herbal
character
this
really
does
taste
like
it
is
born
of
the
earth
unique
in
that
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
really
brings
to
the
partaker
a
sense
of
terroir
while
ive
never
been
this
is
the
find
of
thing
id
want
to
drink
while
watching
for
marauding
vikings
when
in
the
scottish
highlands
on
second
thoughts
maybe
not
because
at
7
5
abv
id
make
for
a
terrible
watchman
especially
after
a
couple
of
these
sweet
on
the
finish
with
some
pine
this
beer
is
mediumfull
in
body
with
a
soft
gentle
carbonation
just
a
touch
watery
on
the
finish
partly
because
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
dextrinous
malt
character
this
beer
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
one
that
i
will
have
to
revisit
and
soon
for
now
however
i
am
off
to
answer
the
call

for
a

with

i
would
never
guess
it
it
hides
it
very
well
and
taste
quite
good
i
am
sure
10
of
these
in
a

will
make
you
happy

toasty
malt

with
an
overarching

taste
is
alot
like
the
nose
on
the
malty
side
quite
fruity
the
pine
isnt
as
prominent
as
i
expected
nor
providing
much
bitterness
but
it
does
add
a
pleasant
layer
of
complexity
crisp

alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
medium
slightly
syrupy
body
with

i
was
originally
looking
for
a
more
bitter
resinous
pine
character
but
i
quite
enjoyed
the
beers
easydrinking
slightly
dry
finish
would
probably
pick
this
up
again
if
it
was
available
more
than
once
a
year
d
very
drinkable
smooth
beer
with
a
pleasant
taste
an
aroma
im
not
much
for
fruity
beers
so
i
couldnt
say
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
for
what
it
is
its
a
solid
well
rounded
beer
pours
a
copperorange
colour
with
thick
white
head
with
fairly
good
retention
almost
no
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
pine
and
toffee
there
seems
to
be
some
fruity
malt
in
there
too
this
really
is
quite
sweet
not
very
bitter
alcohol
is
incredibly
well
hidden
im
surprised
it
is
listed
as
7
5

smooth

a
really
nice
beer
drinkability
a
highly
drinkable
and
highly
enjoyable
beer
definitely
unique
and
definitely
worth
a
try
ive
really
enjoyed
the
other
historic
scottish
beers
from
williams
bros
and
this
one
is
another
great
addition
to
the
lineup
smell
is
ok
cant
really
say
what
i
am
smelling
but
it
is
not
unpleasant
soft
and
sweeter
taste
with
some
herbs
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
medium
body
carbonation
faded
before
the
end
not
an
everyday
beer
but
i
would
like
to
try
more
of
this
style
and
hopefully
a
fresher
bottle
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
cold
weather
nightcapslow
sipper
i
could
easily
drink
like
3
of
thes
7
5
abv
beverages
i
recommend
this
be
had
a
bit
warmer
than
what
this
site
recommends
probably
ca
60
degrees
to
let
the
flavors
have
their
full
say
d
very
nice
enjoyable
and
smooth
tasty
and
interesting
fine
work
taste
is
more
interesting
and
distinctive
with
a
very
interesting
and
very
enjoyable
somewhat
complex
woodyraisinycaramelly
character
it
has
firm
sweetness
with
light
spicey
herbal
zestiness
to
balance
this
rather
than
actual
bitterness
which
is
not
noticeable
it
is
exceedingly
drinkable
and
very
wellrounded
in
character
d
its
defiantly
different
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
looking
for
something
completely
different
from
the
normal
cold
hoppy
brews
of
the
normal
brews
ill
say
it
again
i
like
that
i
can
get
these
beers
here
i
love
trying
something
interesting
and
while
this
isnt
the
greatest
beer
ive
ever
sampled
it
certainly
fulfills
interesting
a
good
beer
although
who
knows
what
the
style
should
be
like
has
a
sweet
component
that
is
surprising
to
me
although
ive
never
chewed
on
pine
before
a
mile
piney
aroma
that
leads
to
the
unique
flavor
the
aroma
also
has
a
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
jelly
beans
sweet
aroma
reminiscent
of
the
flavor
nice
creamy
palate
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
because
the
sweetness
is
balanced
out
with
the
flavors
of
pine
and
spruce
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
d
with
an
abv
on
the
higher
side
i
would
say
its
very
easy
to
drink
no
hard
work
here
just
enjoying
an
interesting
delve
into
the
beers
of
bygone
days
by
far
the
best
of
this
style
ive
tasted
out
of
the
beers
that
are
not
extremely
hard
to
find
this
is
what
normally
starts
my
night
off
at
the
local
establishment
specialty
beers
are
normally
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
this
one
is
a
must
try
if
you
havent
already
instead
of
hops
the
scottish
brewed
beer
back
in
the
day
with
spruce
and
pine
so
it
is
very
different
than
a
hop
brew
the
flavors
come
together
for
a
heavier
sweeter
malt
with
a
light
fruit
finish
leaving
a
wonderful
aroma
and
taste
on
the
palet
its
a
perfect
start
to
the
night
goes
down
extremely
smooth
and
is
delicious
my
mouth
is
watering
for
one
right
now
i
only
gave
it
a
4
5
on
drinkability
mouthfeel
and
appearance
and
not
5s
because
modestly
i
have
not
had
a
beer
that
i
would
give
all
5s
to
the
fact
that
this
beer
has
2
of
the
5
ratings
at
5
sets
a
high
standard
for
others
to
live
by
for
me
delicious
robust
with
a
sweet
start
and
an
equally
sweet
finish
relatively
powerful
though
far
from
overkill
definitely
not
something
the
average
consumer
would
enjoy
but
for
an
evolved
palate
this
beer
is
an
absolute
treat
very
good
with
meals
and
even
better
after
poured
from
a
brown
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
no
head
what
so
ever
smell
is
of
pine
and
malts
taste
is
unique
slightly
sweet
definate
notes
of
pine
and
spruce
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
a
decent
and
unusual
brew
while
not
a
session
drink
a
bottle
or
two
at
time
is
great
worth
the
price
and
effort
to
find
it
d
very
refreshing
and
yet
fulfilling
beer
and
i
recommend
it
i
poured
this
beer
down
the
center
of
a
brandy
snifter
it
came
out
with
a
light
head
and
a
ruby
shade
of
color
the
scent
was
incredibly
sweet
malty
and
almost
reminiscent
of
a
tootsie
roll
i
got
slight
notes
of
pine
in
the
first
whiffs
that
rounded
out
to
a
fuller
christmas
tree
scent
as
the
beer
descended
in
the
glass
the
initial
sip
was
again
very
overtly
sweet
pine
notes
are
not
very
apparent
up
front
but
they
linger
on
the
palate
as
you
journey
through
this
one
the
body
was
very
syrupy
and
coating
almost
unpleasantly
so
interesting
beer
im
just
not
certain
what
the
totality
of
it
is
supposed
to
be
there
are
notes
here
that
dont
fully
communicate
with
one
another
the
pine
and
the
malt
never
seem
to
be
in
sync
impressions
better
than
i
expected
after
tasting
retsina
wine
i
developed
a
distaste
for
pine
flavored
food
or
drink
but
this
has
managed
to
win
my
taste
buds
quite
tasty
and
balanced
certainly
an
interesting
brew
for
such
a
different
beer
the
flavours
work
really
well
almost
like
an
english
ipa
with
pine
instead
of
hops
the
alcohol
is
present
but
well
balanced
id
have
another
i
tried
this
both
at
room
temperature
as
recommended
on
the
bottle
and
chilled
and
much
preferred
it
chilled
the
alcohol
and
malt
are
too
dominant
when
the
beer
is
warm
but
its
pretty
crisp
and
flavorful
cold
not
what
id
expected
but
if
i
could
predict
what
a
new
beer
would
taste
like
before
opening
it
what
would
be
the
point
a
balanced
enjoyable
brew
probably
not
ideal
for
session
drinking
but
great
for
a
sipper
i
cant
score
it
low
because
of
the
lack
of
pine
because
i
genuinely
enjoyed
it
and
frankly
since
ive
never
had
a
pine
ale
i
cant
say
its
not
supposed
to
be
like
this
drinkability
definitely
worth
trying
and
is
very
unique
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
see
this
as
a
regular
purchase
more
like
a
special
occasion
beer
overall
a
solid
good
beer
note
for
some
reason
i
only
find
this
in
single
bottles
do
you
guys
happen
to
know
if
their
even
packaged
in
four
or
sixpacks
or
are
they
just
packaged
to
be
sold
individually
drinkability
could
have
two
or
three
not
the
best
in
the
old
scottish
ales
pack
but
not
bad
either
i
would
still
take
this
over
several
beers
not
a
bad
drink
if
youre
up
to
try
something
else
glad
the
brewer
managed
to
get
the
dry
finish
in
it
it
makes
the
experience
more
dimensional
deep
red
amber
capped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
poor
head
retention
and
no
lace
beautiful
colour
fruity
aroma
of
blueberry
and
raspberry
is
a
bit
of
surprise
in
a
beer
brewed
with
pine
and
spruce
the
pine
is
barely
noticeable
tangy
mixed
berry
and
fresh
bread
flavour
before
a
minty
herbal
finish
a
little
bit
sweet
but
drier
than
its
scent
suggests
alcohol
warms
the
back
of
the
throat
somewhat
light
in
body
with
low
carbonation
light
yet
syrupy
at
the
same
time
alcohol
has
a
bit
of
bite
to
it
decent
but
id
have
liked
it
more
if
it
were
a
bit
more
fullbodied
notes
definitely
not
as
much
pine
and
spruce
flavor
as
i
expected
fairly
sweet
with
a
fair
amount
of
berry
and
general
fruitiness
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
but
not
what
i
expected
interesting
beer
and
worth
trying
interesting
beer
id
definitely
try
this
one
again
overall
surprisingly
good
it
has
a
great
fruity
smell
that
also
comes
across
when
drinking
finishs
well
with
a
slight
bite
of
alcohol
and
nuts
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
like
fruitier
beers
and
for
people
like
me
who
usually
avoid
all
fruity
beers
at
all
cost
you
wont
be
dispointed
if
you
venture
away
from
your
comfort
zone
this
brew
pours
a
deep
copper
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
half
finger
head
and
little
lacingthe
first
aroma
i
get
is
guava
followed
by
some
apples
soaked
in
alcoholthe
taste
is
suprisingly
quite
sweet
with
the
guavaapple
taste
dominating
first
up
followed
by
an
alcohol
infused
piney
finishthis
beer
is
not
bad
by
any
means
and
is
definately
a
totally
different
brew
to
anything
else
ive
tried
and
could
have
more
than
one
of
but
just
could
not
drink
it
all
night
d
a
very
nice
drink
but
certainly
not
in
the
way
of
most
brews
i
guess
i
am
thinking
this
is
pretty
refined
for
a
historic
style
beer
i
could
drink
more
than
one
it
is
enjoyable
but
i
am
pretty
happy
with
just
one
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
but
i
could
not
drink
more
than
one
of
a
day
i
would
recommend
it
but
only
to
those
who
like
to
experience
different
taste
in
their
beer
pours
a
slightly
murky
pale
amber
with
a
dollop
of
white
head
that
quickly
retreats
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
dripping
with
dark
berries
and
light
syrups
a
faint
cry
of
pine
is
detectable
in
the
distance
the
taste
maintains
a
portion
of
this
sweetness
but
it
is
different
than
the
noses
this
is
more
malt
than
berry
and
the
syrup
has
become
more
like
sap
removing
some
of
the
initial
sweetness
replacing
it
with
a
piny
bitterness
the
body
initially
feels
high
on
the
medium
level
but
dissipates
about
as
quickly
as
the
head
following
the
pour
adding
somewhat
to
the
drinkability
love
the
story
on
the
bottle
about
vikings
in
northern
scotland
and
how
they
used
spruce
and
pine
and
how
those
ales
were
very
popular
until
the
end
of
the
19th
century
but
the
history
lesson
did
not
make
this
beer
taste
any
better
this
was
an
experimental
beer
that
i
thought
sounded
very
interesting
when
i
ordered
it
but
i
was
very
disappointed
after
drinking
it
i
wont
have
this
again
and
would
suggest
avoiding
this
beer
d
after
several
encounters
with
spruceenhanced
beers
of
various
styles
i
am
convinced
that
spruce
is
either
inappropriate
for
beer
flavoring
or
an
ingredient
that
requires
the
utmost
restraint
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
half
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
wonderful
pineapple
aroma
small
amount
of
chill
haze
but
not
enough
to
detract
from
the
overall
experience
pine
flavor
is
up
front
with
a
moderately
malty
middle
and
a
surprisingly
watery
finish
very
little
bitterness
but
also
not
as
much
malt
complexity
for
a
scotch
ale
the
pine
flavor
is
well
balanced
with
the
malt
and
provides
an
overall
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
drab
for
the
style
not
bad
but
not
what
i
would
expect
very
little
sweetness
and
tannic
acid
bite
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
as
it
is
a
beautifully
balanced
pine
flavored
beer
but
its
not
a
typical
scotch
ale
by
modern
standards
to
be
sure
d
decent
drikability
per
style
though
one
was
plenty
for
me
at
one
time
interesting
like
most
their
other
beers
with
a
warm
pine
forest
feel
since
im
a
huge
barley
wineold
ale
guy
this
beer
sits
well
with
me
id
love
to
have
a
couple
more
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
strong
ale
with
the
spices
and
the
alcohol
content
a
beautiful
and
different
beer
drinking
experience
warms
my
belleh
the
scots
create
another
water
of
life
this
was
an
amber
pour
into
my
glass
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
and
moderate
lacing
nose
is
of
pine
and
floral
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
body
flavor
is
full
of
pine
and
the
finish
is
spicy
while
the
description
made
you
think
you
were
going
to
get
some
unusual
this
except
for
the
light
spices
was
pretty
ordinary
notes
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
i
will
definitely
be
trying
the
other
spiced
beers
from
their
line
up
although
i
must
say
that
i
was
not
a
huge
fan
of
that
sweet
caramel
flavor
it
was
a
little
too
overpowering
for
me
and
unpleasant
but
the
pine
that
came
through
was
awesome
pull
up
a
chair
next
to
the
hearth
and
enjoy
drinkability
is
decent
there
is
nothing
about
this
brew
that
would
make
it
very
drinkable
simply
because
the
flavors
seem
to
work
against
one
another
the
spiced
and
herbal
notes
are
working
towards
one
flavor
profile
while
the
sweet
malts
in
the
background
do
well
to
work
against
that
could
be
better
but
it
is
still
drinkable
for
7
5
apv
the
taste
is
sweetish
pine
but
not
the
hoppy
type
pine
one
is
accustomed
to
but
a
raw
woodsy
type
pine
flavor
and
lots
of
other
evergreen
like
flavors
this
beer
has
a
very
woodsy
and
raw
simplicity
that
is
really
nice
the
beer
is
quite
sweet
a
touch
boozy
some
caramel
thick
malts
and
lots
of
that
very
unusual
sweet
pine
and
spruce
flavors
what
else
can
you
say
but
try
it
for
its
uniqueness
alone
im
not
sure
i
really
would
want
this
style
as
a
steady
course
but
it
is
a
nice
change
up
for
sure
somewhat
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
somewhat
drinkable
considering
hte
alcohol
percentage
im
very
impressed
how
decent
this
is
conisdering
no
hops
were
using
in
the
brewing
process
a
very
unique
beer
for
sure
it
is
a
pretty
mild
brew
the
alcohol
is
unnoticeable
so
it
is
pretty
drinkable
but
it
isnt
too
exciting
in
the
taste
department
dwont
drink
this
one
again
maybe
more
spruce
flavor
and
this
beer
would
be
worth
it
drinkability
while
i
like
the
concept
behind
this
beer
i
dont
feel
particularly
like
drinking
a
lot
more
of
it
i
may
try
to
find
it
again
near
the
holidays
next
year
however
drinkability
id
hesitate
to
drink
this
all
night
however
if
it
were
acoompanied
by
a
nice
highlands
stew
or
hearty
type
meal
i
am
sure
i
could
down
many
more
of
these
in
the
right
setting
but
standing
alone
1
is
enough
maybe
2
at
a
pinch
aroma
is
sweet
and
there
is
something
that
i
cannot
identify
the
flavor
gives
it
away
holy
raspberries
flavor
batman
sweet
sweet
sweet
too
sweet
for
me
solvency
you
can
totally
taste
the
alcohol
maybe
this
beer
would
be
better
with
some
age
on
it
but
upon
closer
examination
i
cannot
find
a
date
on
the
bottle
who
knows
how
old
this
is
not
a
repeat
final
thoughts
well
this
is
my
second
gruit
beer
and
if
the
last
two
offerings
in
my
sample
pack
continue
to
impress
i
think
ive
found
my
new
favorite
style
save
for
a
bit
of
a
lacking
head
there
isnt
many
negative
things
you
can
say
about
this
beer
i
sadly
dont
foresee
full
packs
of
this
stuff
coming
out
any
time
soon
though
ahh
well
if
i
could
sum
up
my
experience
of
this
4pack
in
one
word
simply
put
it
would
be
interesting
peculiar
means
odd
and
strange
whereas
interesting
is
new
and
exciting
the
scents
and
tastes
are
unlike
anything
ive
encountered
before
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
each
one
although
they
may
not
be
the
most
pronounced
or
flavourful
beers
ive
had
im
still
very
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
buy
and
sample
these
bad
boys
maybe
next
christmas
ill
buy
this
pack
again
just
to
be
reminded
of
the
innovative
taste
and
smell
of
these
scottish
gruits
could
drink
these
all
day
if
i
had
them
its
definitely
the
best
of
the
4
bottles
if
you
get
the
gift
pack
as
the
liquid
passes
over
my
lips
i
feel
a
sense
of
gratitude
that
this
style
of
beer
has
long
since
survived
those
who
originally
made
it
the
brewery
recommends
the
beer
as
a
digestif
but
given
the
rather
pensive
impression
it
has
left
on
me
id
consider
it
a
reflectif
when
drinking
this
beer
be
sure
to
close
your
eyes
and
take
the
time
to
contemplate
the
flavours
the
disposition
and
all
the
history
that
is
contained
in
your
glass
drinkability
very
nice
i
will
drink
it
again
good
scottish
ale
different
and
worth
trying
but
not
really
a
beer
id
drink
for
refreshment
or
with
food
the
jury
is
still
out
im
calling
it
better
than
average
since
it
is
very
different
and
not
unappealing
drinkability
very
strange
flavours
but
quite
enjoyable
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
beer
that
uses
scots
pine
and
spruce
sprigs
instead
of
any
hops
but
this
is
a
good
beer
this
is
very
drinkable
and
i
would
like
to
have
it
again
i
cant
say
why
i
like
the
beer
but
i
tend
to
enjoy
beers
with
a
strong
and
interesting
brewing
history
mouthfeeldrinkability
soft
and
seafoamy
in
the
mouth
the
gentle
waves
allow
the
flavors
to
come
across
in
total
balance
a
joy
to
drink
ive
been
enamored
with
these
great
ales
from
craigmill
over
the
last
few
weeks
d
overall
i
have
to
say
i
can
only
drink
one
of
these
there
is
just
something
about
the
taste
that
isnt
for
me
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
orangebrown
hue
with
lots
and
lots
of
suspended
sediment
and
a
single
finger
of
soapy
offwhite
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lace
the
first
whiff
that
i
get
out
of
the
bottle
is
like
scottish
whisky
alcoholic
and
malty
the
beer
itself
smells
of
caramel
malt
a
mild
herbal
essence
and
some
alcohol
warming
the
taste
is
very
medicinal
up
front
the
kind
of
medicine
that
i
imagine
holistics
or
naturalists
employing
tree
root
dried
sap
a
pine
tree
branch
across
the
face
when
hiking
a
bit
off
the
path
all
stewing
in
booze
uh
i
mean
medicinal
alcohol
and
caramel
carbonation
is
fairly
low
the
body
kind
of
light
for
how
it
looks
and
tastes
but
smooth
overall
and
it
finishes
offdry
with
a
strong
pine
essence
but
this
time
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
hops
and
is
more
direct
and
well
real
im
sure
i
could
get
used
to
this
over
time
should
hops
no
longer
be
available
for
the
modern
beer
brewing
process
but
given
my
wellensconced
predilections
for
post
19th
century
uk
beer
ingredients
i
have
to
view
this
as
an
interesting
but
no
longer
useful
artifact
like
vinyl
records
or
usb
1
0
that
and
i
mildly
object
to
the
proclamation
of
ale
brewed
with
natural
flavors
on
the
label
what
hops
arent
natural
quite
tasty
and
different
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
one
made
me
feel
like
some
badass
scotsman
in
the
middle
ages
i
tried
this
beer
on
december
14
2008
after
purchasing
a
4
pack
of
historic
scottish
ales
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outets
the
beer
poured
an
transparent
muddy
brown
colour
with
a
shortlived
thin
head
the
aroma
was
very
weak
but
there
were
hints
of
sweet
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
midly
carbonated
the
flavour
was
bitter
and
sweet
hints
of
both
spruce
and
pine
come
through
with
the
malt
the
ingredients
do
not
list
hops
on
the
bottle
interesting
appearance
is
a
beautiful
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
smells
of
raspberries
infused
with
a
piney
wheatberry
scent
a
grassy
sweet
taste
is
overrun
with
pine
and
a
spicy
tingle
of
nutmeg
and
cardamom
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
supple
with
a
round
full
body
and
smooth
syrupy
finish
d
this
beer
has
some
good
depth
and
rich
flavor
to
the
malts
but
there
is
nothing
to
support
it
or
balance
the
flavor
i
didnt
taste
any
flavors
from
the
pine
or
even
many
hops
and
the
fusel
alcohol
hint
wasnt
enough
to
balance
the
malt
d
pretty
solid
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
brews
this
is
quite
an
interesting
beer
for
me
this
is
my
first
beer
spiced
with
gruit
and
not
hops
as
such
its
a
little
hard
for
me
to
pin
down
a
certain
feeling
about
this
beer
one
way
or
the
other
but
in
the
end
it
was
pretty
good
and
well
worth
a
try
a
very
mild
flavor
really
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
with
no
real
hop
flavor
if
i
really
look
for
it
i
can
taste
the
hint
of
spruce
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
oily
seems
to
take
like
10
seconds
before
a
whole
swallow
goes
down
there
is
something
im
missing
i
just
cant
come
up
with
it
right
now
its
fairly
easy
to
drink
i
would
say
probably
wont
buy
another
overall
i
am
really
enjoying
this
aged
beer
and
now
i
want
to
go
try
it
fresh
d
moderately
drinkable
i
have
to
say
the
lack
of
carbonation
body
is
slowing
me
down
almost
like
that
finnish
sahti
i
had
a
few
weeks
back
abv
is
high
enough
to
take
notice
thanks
to
trackside
liquor
for
getting
this
one
available
here
in
the
land
of
cl
clam
good
stuff
slightly
hazy
appearance
almost
looks
like
someones
homebrewed
ipa
but
boy
does
it
not
taste
like
an
ipa
or
anything
else
ive
ever
had
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
with
a
succession
of
flavors
like
youre
violet
beauregard
chewing
the
infamous
3coursemeal
gum
at
wonkas
factory
all
sorts
of
flavors
going
on
here
now
here
comes
an
ethereal
bit
of
raspberry
wtf
raspberry
curious
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
carbonated
the
body
of
the
beer
is
a
little
more
over
medium
body
the
finish
lingers
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
like
an
evergreen
tea
the
flavors
are
delicate
but
it
is
balanced
the
beer
as
a
whole
is
very
nice
the
head
dropped
like
a
rock
i
am
kinda
impressed
by
the
beer
this
is
a
beer
style
that
i
never
tried
and
it
is
really
good
there
are
little
bits
of
the
head
linger
in
the
glass
not
enough
to
consider
it
lacing
it
was
difficult
to
pick
out
some
of
those
tastes
and
smells
im
not
sure
if
i
even
got
all
of
them
right
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
and
fun
to
drink
d
having
never
tasted
a
sprucepine
beer
before
im
not
quite
sure
what
to
compare
this
to
but
i
think
it
needs
some
more
pine
this
stuff
is
way
too
sweet
with
almost
no
balance
id
try
it
again
perhaps
if
i
was
to
find
a
really
fresh
bottle
overall
impression
not
really
impressed
with
this
one
if
it
had
more
depth
on
the
front
end
it
might
be
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
you
can
barely
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
one
yet
it
gives
you
a
pretty
hefty
buzz
for
the
7
5
abv
it
contains
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
color
is
a
hazy
amber
no
head
thats
my
one
complaint
though
no
head
the
aroma
includes
some
ester
characters
perhaps
from
the
yeast
a
subtle
spicy
frutiness
and
the
barest
suggestion
of
pine
as
well
as
a
detectable
aroma
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
at
first
sweet
and
then
you
detect
a
spiciness
and
just
the
subtlest
hint
of
pine
ill
admit
i
was
a
little
scared
of
this
beer
but
it
isnt
so
scary
just
sweet
and
clean
and
tasty
the
taste
also
includes
detectable
malt
finishes
with
a
taste
of
greenery
more
of
an
earthy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
well
carbonated
and
perhaps
just
a
bit
sticky
phenomenal
beer
i
could
drink
more
of
these
sadly
i
bought
only
one
in
a
sample
pack
i
dont
know
if
i
could
ever
find
myself
drinking
this
beer
regularly
though
thats
not
a
knock
on
its
quality
its
a
somewhat
enjoyable
beer
but
its
not
your
typical
beer
i
can
imagine
someone
who
likes
tea
could
get
into
this
the
pine
is
in
there
along
with
the
standard
malt
compliments
tasty
different
but
tasty
recommended
d
this
is
good
but
probably
best

my
bottle
was
a
couple
months
late
but
still
good

slightly

inside

few
spots

hanging
around

sweet

almost
honeylike
aroma

the

interesting
seems
a
little
thin

nice

worth
a
try
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
d
that
said
its
tasty
and
it
goes
down
easy
id
drink
it
again
i
almost
feel
badly
about
reviewing
this
beer
because
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
with
in
terms
of
style
and
it
just
isnt
what
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
for
maybe
if
they
replaced
the
pine
brances
with
some
simcoe
hops
everything
would
be
okay
d
im
glad
i
tried
the
style
but
i
dont
think
ill
pick
it
up
again
poura

golden
orange

in

this
is

by
the
fire
d
for
a
beer
that
has
lots
of
intrinsic
value
its
interesting
enough
to
get
me
to
have
another
aside
from
its
spectacle
painfully
awful
this
beer
smells
and
looks
great
darker
amber
with
a
moderate
tan
head
aroma
is
very
nice
piney
and
clean
but
the
taste
is
ass
in
your
mouth
bad
its
as
if
someone
put
a
tree
in
a
blender
and
hit
liquify
then
mixed
with
turpentine
avoid
unless
you
need
to
strip
the
paint
off
your
house
d
outstanding
i
though
this
would
be
some
pinesol
chemically
christmas
tree
bullshit
but
its
not
like
that
at
all
this
tastes
like
a
big
honeyladen
tripel
with
a
gentle
hint
of
fresh
green
mint
the
sweetness
could
get
a
little
bit
cloying
but
the
refreshing
spruce
and
gentle
floral
hops
really
keep
this
refreshing
and
lighter
feeling
than
it
actually
is
damn
good
stuff
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
i
cant
say
it
really
tastes
like
i
expected
it
to
i
expected
a
lot
more
pine
sap
sort
of
flavor
but
it
doesnt
have
that
unique
different
and
definitely
worth
trying
overall
a
good
trip
down
the
road
less
traveled
worth
a
try
it
was
an
interesting
beer
ill
give
them
that
one
it
definitely
could
have
used
more
pine
or
spruce
in
here
the
raspberry
filling
was
good
but
this
is
suppose
to
be
a
pine
ale
not
a
raspberry
chocolate
beer
you
know
what
thats
not
a
bad
idea
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
nose
has
sweet
malts
and
light
herbs
the
taste
is
also
a
bit
light
good
malt
profile
but
needs
a
stronger
herbal
presence
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
conclusion
this
brewery
never
lets
me
down
their
stuff
is
just
fantastic
the
ebulums
my
favorite
still
i
think
this
just
shouts
christmas
eve
in
front
of
a
roaring
fire
with
snow
falling
outside
this
isnt
easy
to
find
around
here
but
at
2
99
a
bottle
im
definitely
gonna
pick
a
couple
up
to
save
for
winter
ajh
although
making
beer
without
hops
probably
wasnt
as
much
of
a
hardship
for
early
americans
as
i
imagined
there
is
nothing
quite
like
hops
once
you
have
become
a
hop
head
poured
a
rich
dark
amber
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
thin
white
head
lots
of
visible
sediment
has
a
scotchyalcohol
smell
a
caramel
sweetness
and
some
dried
fruit
notes
raisins
prunes
dried
cherries
taste
is
rather
sweet
and
fruity
a
pleasant
grainy
taste
medium
bodied
and
warming
really
this
is
not
what
i
expected
in
this
ale
but
its
a
pleasant
surprise
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
to
enjoy
frequently
personal
taste
but
i
would
consider
revisiting
this
beer
again
not
the
best
gruit
ive
had
but
definitely
interesting
pours
a
must
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
settled
into
the
slightest
of
rings
the
aroma
is
of
fruit
punch
raspberries
with
some
herbal
notes
interesting
the
taste
is
of
a
nice
woody
malt
hints
of
chocolate
there
is
a
slightly
caramalized
raspberry
flavor
some
port
as
well
the
feel
is
moderate
with
tingley
carbonation
a
bit
dryastringent
a
fairly
sweet
brew
that
has
enough
malt
backing
to
keep
it
drinkable
there
is
an
herbal
note
that
runs
throughout
to
make
it
unique
nice
beer
different
drinkability
is
fairly
high
although
the
alcohol
is
starting
to
get
high
it
is
quite
tasty
it
is
very
difficult
to
assign
a
rating
to
this
beer
its
difficult
finding
other
beers
to
measure
it
against
and
its
difficult
to
know
if
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
just
due
to
the
lack
of
beers
of
this
type
a
great
experience
nonetheless
t
m
d
quite
a
sweet
beer
with
a
lot
of
candylike
notes
and
something
reminiscent
of
bubblegum
but
like
the
old
sticks
that
came
with
baseball
cards
once
upon
a
time
do
they
still
do
that
fruity
essence
the
spruce
flavouring
is
not
overwhelming
at
all
quite
an
intriguing
beer
quite
full
bodied
and
it
comes
with
a
clean
finish
no
stickiness
oiliness
creaminess
etc
just
straight
up
and
welldefined
i
was
quite
pleased
with
this
and
i
believe
the
price
was
quite
reasonable
as
well
i
could
certainly
go
for
some
more
like
i
said
it
was
alright
but
just
not
for
me
d
something
i
enjoyed
but
anything
this
off
the
beaten
path
taste
wise
isnt
the
sort
of
thing
i
could
make
an
evening
of
glad
i
got
to
try
it
interesting
and
different
thanks
interesting
but
on
the
overly
sweet
side
you
win
alba
scots
pine
ale
down
the
drain
you
go
i
really
dont
know
how
to
classify
this
ale
its
different
but
too
different
for
my
tastes
the
flavor
is
hard
to
digest
its
a
good
thing
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
d
this
one
might
take
a
while
to
get
used
to
interesting
though
and
worth
trying
d
an
interesting
and
unusual
ale
i
would
recommend
as
a
night
cap
or
after
dinner
sipper
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
hue
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
quickly
falls
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
strong
caramel
malts
evergreen
and
some
earthiness
some
scotch
and
leather
in
the
nose
as
well
very
interesting
aroma
to
this
one
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
nuttiness
and
scotch
flavors
the
spruce
and
pine
emerge
midway
with
a
good
amount
of
butterscotch
and
caramel
aftertaste
consists
of
sap
some
woodiness
and
candy
sugar
medium
to
full
body
with
a
rich
and
creamy
feel
carbonation
is
mild
the
big
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
this
one
again
anytime
soon
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
lot
m
fullbodied
and
moderately
carbonated
very
drinkable
for
abv
i
really
expected
something
more
piney
like
a
simcoe
apa
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
drinkability
good
for
an
every
once
and
a
while
type
beer
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
its
quite
a
treat
to
sample
a
piece
of
beer
history
but
on
the
other
hand
im
not
too
keen
to
revisit
it
anytime
soon
too
sweet
and
cloying
for
my
tastes
the
alcohol
is
quit
evident
in
flavor
and
effects
i
will
pass
on
another
one
overall
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
its
got
a
lot
of
stuff
going
on
im
interested
to
try
their
other
beer
not
quite
my
favorite
of
the
craigmill
brews
but
very
impressive
and
interesting
nonetheless
alba
scots
pine
ale
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
11
2
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
quite
malty
and
maybe
a
bit
fruity
im
not
really
getting
any
pine
or
spruce
the
body
is
medium
to
thick
the
flavor
is
quite
malty
and
quite
fruity
almost
raspberry
like
but
not
quite
as
i
drink
more
i
think
the
sprucepine
like
flavors
start
to
appear
more
in
the
aftertaste
than
anywhere
else
an
oddball
of
a
beer
worth
trying
but
i
wouldnt
be
likely
to
buy
it
again
no
wonder
the
vikings
were
sailing
everywhere
kicking
peoples
asses
and
conquering
them
they
were
looking
for
better
beer
to
drink
so
the
vikings
brought
this
to
scotland
eh
nice
import
md
finishes
malty
thin
brew
the
malty
finish
is
excellent
highly
drinkable
curiosity
lowered
this
one
into
my
shopping
cart
as
part
of
a
set
of
four
unusual
scottish
ales
to
my
surprise
alba
was
easy
drinking
and
far
simpler
than
anticipated
but
clearly
worth
more
than
the
one
shot
of
curiosity
such
nice
balance
in
this
beer
makes
it
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
it
all
night
definately
my
favorite
of
the
sample
4pack
from
heather
ale
ltd
i
just
wish
we
could
get
some
sixers
of
these
brews
i
would
love
to
have
such
a
different
session
brew
as
these
on
a
weekend
basis
the
last
of
my
ancient
beers
of
scotland
mix
pack
i
must
say
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
hoppy
taste
but
still
had
that
sweet
viscous
quality
had
it
chilled
in
a
hefeweizen
glass
poured
a
color
on
the
border
of
yelloworange
to
redorange
with
a
wee
fast
melting
head
smell
was
of
faint
wet
pine
logs
and
some
honey
or
is
it
sap
taste
is
a
sweet
sap
cover
pine
log
at
first
and
then
the
spruce
after
taste
just
hangs
at
the
back
of
your
throat
for
ever
everytime
i
exhale
its
like
i
ate
an
evergreen
breath
mint
pretty
smooth
for
the
most
part
but
my
god
is
it
fir
tree
in
my
mouth
cant
say
i
would
try
again
but
worth
the
one
bottle
try
ratings
were
for
my
tastes
not
for
style
as
this
is
my
first
taste
of
pine
ale
good
full
body
with
decent
carbonation
a
real
nice
drinker
and
a
really
good
beer
across
the
boards
i
love
this
gruitherbed
style
so
unique
keep
em
coming
the
flavor
is
big
on
caramel
and
toffee
with
subtle
herbal
and
floral
notes
around
the
edges
i
dont
really
taste
any
pine
but
i
dont
mind
as
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
overall
its
sweet
smooth
and
subtle
not
terribly
different
from
a
wee
heavy
but
worth
a
try
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
too
filling
nice
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
when
you
want
something
a
little
different
however
im
not
sure
i
would
want
to
drink
much
more
than
one
before
i
start
looking
for
something
else
this
brew
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
inch
of
cream
head
a
good
whiff
reveals
a
lot
of
fresh
fruitiness
heavy
on
the
strawberry
and
light
on
banana
it
tasted
of
caramel
malt
and
was
lightly
grassy
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
and
washes
down
easy
with
the
malt
flavor
clinging
to
the
tongue
in
a
tingly
sparkling
sensation
on
the
tongue
i
found
it
refreshing
the
caramel
is
sweet
without
being
overbearing
or
heavy
soft
smooth
medium
bodied
not
highly
carbonated
doesnt
taste
or
smell
like
spruce
or
pine
to
me
drinkability
here
is
average
due
to
the
taste
and
carbonation
i
cant
say
id
want
more
than
2
of
these
in
a
row
making
this
a
nonsession
beer
for
me
if
i
could
find
a
good
food
pairing
that
might
change
drinkability
not
very
common
beer
this
ale
contains
no
hops
but
twigs
of
pine
drinkability
interesting
style
that
is
worth
a
try
wellexecuted
but
not
something
i
would
drink
everyday
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
some
what
medicinal
it
has
a
very
malt
strong
flavor
comprised
of
the
afore
mentioned
fruit
and
such
that
becomes
cloying
with
the
medicinal
cough
syrup
aspect
by
the
end
of
the
glass
i
actually
like
the
flavor
but
one
bottle
would
be
all
id
enjoy
in
a
sitting
ive
never
tasted
a
brew
quite
like
this
give
it
a
try
with
an
open
mind
its
different
12
oz
bottle
copped
singly
from
garys
in
madison
for
3
25
nice
copper
and
amber
appearnce
leads
to
a
decentsized
frothy
and
foamy
head
nice
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
aroma
reveals
a
nice
combination
of
the
two
taste
is
full
of
grapes
no
joke
the
grape
and
plum
essence
bursts
through
on
this
one
ultrathick
ultrasweet
and
very
cloying
couldnt
even
finish
a
12
oz
of
this
one
due
to
the
overbearing
and
dominating
sweet
grape
flavor
that
poured
through
mouthfeel
was
decent
at
best
and
the
drinkability
really
suffered
due
to
the
overwhelming
sweet
and
sugarladen
flavor
that
was
too
much
for
me
to
take
really
got
to
have
a
strong
personal
liking
for
this
one
if
you
want
to
enjoy
it
i
personally
wasnt
crazy
about
this
one
at
all
thick
and
moderatelycarbonated
mouthfeel
and
dangerously
easy
to
drink
for
7
5
abv
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
out
of
this
and
to
be
honest
i
only
picked
it
up
for
the
novelty
factor
very
very
impressed
and
i
am
definitely
anxious
to
try
more
experiments
from
heather
ale
sort
of
a
rusty
amber
color
with
a
sorryass
little
head
that
didnt
get
nowhere
man
smells
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
candy
dish
at
grandmas
first
taste
is
sweet
caramelized
malt
second
taste
finds
me
thinking
hmmm
christmas
the
third
taste
has
me
going
no
wait
christmas
tree
tastes
of
fir
needles
pine
sap
more
aromas
pine
cone
but
not
sharply
there
is
still
a
foundation
of
scotch
ale
english
barley
winelike
malt
that
keeps
everything
in
good
order
medium
body
and
finishes
with
the
sweet
malts
pierced
here
and
there
by
pine
cones
being
dropped
on
my
head
by
squirrels
a
fine
beer
for
december
the
second
half
of
december
and
no
other
time
than
that
or
maybe
good
for
coming
out
of
hibernation
little
after
taste
bottle
from
the
lcbo
i
really
was
not
expecting
this
to
be
as
good
as
it
turned
out
the
nose
was
strongly
of
pine
and
spruce
and
had
me
concerned
that
these
fresh
flavours
would
make
me
feel
like
i
had
been
gnawing
at
a
christmas
tree
for
half
an
hour
surprisingly
the
pine
taste
was
nicely
balanced
by
a
honey
sweetness
and
although
still
being
the
salient
flavour
it
didnt
prevent
the
drink
from
tasting
like
beer
as
i
thought
it
would
an
interesting
scottish
take
on
a
tripel
and
something
i
wish
i
had
more
of
on
the
whole
i
would
say
this
beer
is
certainly
worthy
of
another
try
though
not
the
smoothest
or
most
balanced
beer
ive
ever
drank
it
is
cool
to
think
you
are
imbibing
the
same
type
of
ale
as
viking
invaders
may
have
quaffed
a
thousand
or
so
years
ago
a
nice
beer
definitely
worth
a
go
dont
pass
this
one
up
in
fear
of
it
might
be
something
it
is
not
pours
a
hazed
ruby
with
no
head
nose
is
sweet
like
cotton
candy
flavor
has
a
really
odd
and
unique
tang
to
it
i
suppose
it
is
the
pine
very
present
sweet
flavor
to
it
feel
is
low
on
bubble
and
thicker
with
a
slightly
syrup
like
feel
on
the
tongue
definitely
drinkable
another
from
heather
ale
worth
trying
tastes
rather
fruity
earthy
some
pine
and
malt
there
is
a
nice
lingering
finish
that
also
hints
at
pine
and
alcohol
this
beer
has
a
very
interesting
taste
all
the
flavors
seem
to
brend
together
really
well
making
it
hard
to
describe
what
youre
tasting
over
all
i
think
this
is
very
good
malty
pine
aroma
with
hints
of
the
alcohol
orangetan
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
creamy
head
great
flavor
of
a
malty
scotch
not
scottish
ale
with
some
woodysmoky
character
and
pine
notes
nice
aftertaste
the
pine
blends
well
with
the
heavy
malt
character
the
drinkability
is
ok
but
not
the
best
as
the
style
may
take
time
to
bet
used
to
mk
this
is
an
acquired
taste
its
very
different
from
the
beers
we
normally
drink
never
having
an
herbed
ale
before
this
was
one
of
the
most
unique
beer
tasting
experiences
of
my
young
career
i
learned
to
like
it
and
at
the
end
i
loved
it
recommended
wow
what
a
wonderfully
complex
palate
it
starts
off
sweet
with
notes
of
dark
fruits
cherries
herbs
and
earth
and
as
the
beer
warms
the
pine
and
other
spices
really
envelope
the
taste
buds
alcohol
warms
the
finish
i
always
enjoy
when
you
think
a
beer
is
going
in
one
direction
and
then
suddenly
and
pleasantly
it
takes
you
in
another
thats
what
this
one
did
for
me
the
sweetness
and
spiciness
along
with
the
alcohol
make
for
an
enjoyable
brew
my
favorite
gruit
from
this
pack
so
far
another
winner
from
these
fellas
great
beer
drinkabilty
i
could
go
for
one
of
these
and
it
would
be
on
to
a
different
beer
great
to
have
once
in
a
while
pretty
good
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
deep
amber
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
floral
with
a
touch
of
citrus
the
taste
is
of
sweet
caramel
and
flowers
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
gruit
i
would
drink
this
again
cloudy
ruby
rust
colored
brew
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
and
average
lacing
the
aroma
is
herbal
sort
of
minty
pine
hops
almost
a
eucalyptus
smell
with
a
hint
of
carmel
very
interesting
the
taste
is
a
thick
hoppy
grape
deal
not
highly
carbonated
and
despite
a
thick
bodied
feel
it
still
seems
somewhat
aqueous
fairly
drinkable
for
a
relatively
strong
drink
it
has
good
alcohol
presence
and
will
benefit
from
warming
a
bit
room
temperature
it
hits
you
with
a
tart
start
but
there
is
a
presence
of
honey
and
oak
among
other
curious
qualities
definitely
an
intriguing
brew
and
worth
trying
it
inspires
me
to
try
others
from
this
brewery
and
id
like
to
sample
this
again
unchilled
one
of
the
strangest
brews
ive
ever
come
across
but
also
a
favorite
best
tasted
with
an
open
mind
and
not
too
cold
the
smell
is
difficult
to
place
as
is
the
initial
taste
in
the
mouth
but
both
are
pleasant
it
seems
to
coat
the
mouth
without
being
heavybodied
the
finish
is
what
always
throws
me
as
i
get
a
hint
of
berry
at
the
end
ive
had
several
albas
over
the
years
and
the
finish
has
always
been
the
same
great
for
after
dinner
or
as
a
treat
after
a
long
day
an
excellent
beer
it
pours
smooth
into
a
glass
with
a
nice
head
and
good
lacing
it
was
a
very
nice
dark
wheat
coloring
close
to
an
amber
it
has
an
excellent
scent
a
great
mixture
with
a
large
deep
malt
and
a
great
overtone
of
pine
giving
hints
of
the
outdoors
very
nice
flavor
everything
is
mixed
together
well
again
with
an
excellent
hint
of
pine
in
the
taste
but
not
strong
enough
to
make
it
harsh
it
goes
down
smooth
an
excellent
beer
d
perhaps
good
treated
as
a
digestif
its
certainly
an
interesting
brew
but
not
one
id
be
going
back
to
the
other
gruits
from
this
brewery
are
much
more
drinkable
drinkability
this
is
quite
an
interesting
beer
that
is
pretty
much
a
sipper
not
really
because
of
the
alcohol
but
because
the
flavors
are
so
bold
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
one
but
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
after
dinner
d
drinkability
is
tough
to
call
on
this
one
the
herbal
flavors
are
a
good
bit
too
strong
for
my
taste
but
they
are
very
interesting
i
think
i
would
really
enjoy
a
variation
on
this
with
about
34
of
the
herbs
replaced
with
hops
as
it
is
this
beer
is
kind
of
harsh
and
medicinal
and
while
drinking
one
was
a
unique
experience
drinking
two
would
be
a
chore

deep
amber

large
offwhite

unusual
sweetish
aroma
notes
of
overripe
raspberries
and
pine
needles
not
very
pleasant
the
flavour
is
very
sweet
and
alcoholic
piney
and
sugary
notes
unusual
beer
but
is
it
really
good
im
sorry
but
this
is
not
for
me
d
this
couldnt
be
a
session
beer
it
is
far
too
rich
but
one
a
night
during
the
fall
and
winter
months
would
get
me
through
any
long
ship
voyage
d
a
very
interesting
beer
it
is
nice
to
try
ancient
styles
that
arent
hopped
as
a
change
of
pace
i
would
buy
again
and
recommend
it
slightly
cloudy
yellowish
brown
with
thin
white
head
that
leaves
just
a
little
lace
of
small
bubbles
rich
grainy
malt
with
pine
earth
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
can
be
picked
up
in
the
aroma
the
initial
taste
is
of
malt
and
pine
wood
that
is
just
a
little
sweet
with
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
both
if
and
aftertaste
are
like
nothing
i
have
tried
before
there
is
a
hint
of
oatmeal
or
grain
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
pretty
dry
texture
and
a
soft
carbonation
and
a
slightly
metallic
finish
you
can
pick
up
the
alcohol
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
i
was
pleased
to
try
it
has
a
very
different
flavor
from
the
malt
and
hop
rich
beers
i
am
used
to
drinking
i
would
probably
try
it
again
but
it
definitely
wont
become
a
regular
i
would
like
to
taste
it
with
some
other
beers
of
the
same
variety
but
i
have
never
seen
one
for
sale
try
it
with
a
rich
aged
cheddar
and
crackers
or
maybe
some
lamb
chops
12oz
bottle
from
rons
lighter
amber
translucent
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
offwhite
head
smells
like
caramel
malt
spice
and
pine
sweetness
is
the
first
thing
i
noticed
with
a
flavor
im
not
familiar
with
im
assuming
pine
playing
a
strong
role
and
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
though
otherwise
its
very
wellhidden
medium
bodied
not
syrupy
or
sticky
at
all
fairly
drinkable
an
interesting
ale
and
definitely
worth
the
try
not
something
id
seek
out
again
nor
would
i
oppose
having
it
again
a
pretty
unique
solid
ale
has
a
nice
clear
amber
aleish
color
typical
but
good
aroma
is
malty
with
strong
fruit
and
spicy
hints
and
some
hop
tone
flavor
is
strong
both
malty
and
hoppy
with
an
overtone
rather
like
the
way
a
pine
tree
smells
bitterness
is
minimal
this
is
unlike
any
ale
i
have
ever
tasted
pleasant
and
distinctive
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
is
almost
a
fruit
beer
and
in
fact
definitely
tastes
like
one
this
is
definitely
the
tastiest
of
these
brews
that
i
have
had
so
far
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
fine
prickle
of
carbonation
interesting
but
i
prefer
other
styles
drinkability
an
excellent
strong
ale
with
lots
of
depth
d
i
was
actually
hoping
for
more
pine
flavors
the
fruity
flavors
were
good
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
for
d
its
a
more
complicated
ale
than
ive
had
in
a
while
and
thats
a
good
thing
this
one
has
character
unfortunately
i
didnt
care
for
it
the
heavy
alcohol
and
the
sour
aftertaste
really
prevented
me
from
being
able
to
enjoy
it
outstanding
notes
a
style
and
a
beer
on
its
own
that
many
will
not
like
im
not
going
to
hunt
this
down
by
any
stretch
but
it
is
incredibly
complex
and
tastes
and
feels
very
ancient
in
taste
no
zippy
hops
no
roasted
or
toasted
malts
in
fact
this
has
a
medicinal
quality
that
actually
works
interesting
and
recommended
poured
a
nice
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
left
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
on
the
malty
side
with
some
pine
notes
the
pine
comes
through
beautifully
in
the
taste
there
is
a
very
unique
bitterness
that
i
was
surprised
to
enjoy
as
a
hophead
this
is
a
truly
unique
beer
that
i
would
gladly
enjoy
on
occasion
drinkability
this
was
slow
going
for
me
and
interesting
but
not
something
i
want
again
quite
drinkable
and
a
surprisingly
refreshing
brew
due
to
its
somewhat
dry
and
mildly
astringent
character
more
than
just
a
novelty
beer
but
this
obviously
isnt
for
everyone
either
but
it
was
a
good
brew
on
a
cool
spring
night
strange
maybe
a
little
boring
after
some
while
not
so
easy
to
say
drinkability
is
good
today
felt
like
a
good
day
for
something
like
this
with
no
hops
and
just
tons
of
malt
the
malt
balances
well
against
the
alcohol
making
this
one
really
enjoyable
from
a
11
2oz
bottle
that
says
best
before
october
2006
uh
oh
hope
this
ages
gracefully
pours
darker
than
expected
almost
a
ruddy
red
wine
color
with
tawny
highlights
with
very
little
head
just
some
impact
bubbles
aroma
is
a
touch
unpleasant
with
some
funkiness
that
reminds
me
of
mushrooms
or
manure
but
as
the
glass
warms
some
more
fragrant
inviting
aromas
come
out
pear

spices
tobacco

nice
and

the
palate

as
it
goes
along
and
a

finish
mouthfeel
is
quite
still
and
a
bit
more
watery
than
i
expected
overall
this
beer
is
a
very
interesting
trip
through
history
its
missing
a
lot
of
hallmarks
of
todays
beers
but
it
makes
up
for
that
with
originality
ive
often
said
after
tasting
historical
ale
reproductions
that
im
glad
i
live
in
the
present
time
but
alba
could
make
me
reconsider
that
bias
overall
an
interesting
and
drinkable
beer
the
first
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
whammy
and
unexpected
but
not
because
its
bad
or
poorly
crafted
but
simply
because
its
different
i
can
imagine
why
the
vikings
once
liked
this
style
beers
like
this
remind
me
why
we
are
all
lucky
to
be
living
in
the
greatest
era
in
history
for
beer
drinkers
its
well
balanced
and
has
an
interesting
and
complex
combination
of
aromas
and
flavors
i
certainly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
wants
to
experiment
but
if
i
could
find
it
in
6
packs
id
make
it
a
regular
part
of
my
rotation
everyone
should
try
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
thin
tightly
packed
light
tan
head
aroma
of
bananas
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
pepper
didnt
notice
much
pine
in
the
smell
taste
was
raisiny
sweet
with
some
bananas
and
piney
taste
not
piney
hops
as
this
contains
no
hops
mouthfeel
was
pretty
heavy
like
a
scotch
ale
this
is
very
pleasent
but
its
not
as
good
as
i
remembered
from
last
year
2005
good
deep
reddish
color
with
a
decent
carbonation
level
low
aromai
was
expecting
more
spruce
slight
spiciness
to
it
malty

with
an
underlying
flavor
of
spruce

it
spruce
is
not
all
that
dominant
somewhat
toffeeish
and
floral
good

nice

i
dont
think
i
could

too
many

you
love
to

more
about
the

and
what
would
compel
a
person
to
cook
pine
this
ale
was
a
departure
from
what
i
expected
more
sweet
than
bitter
a
good
sipping
brew
it
poured
dark
amber
with
a
nice
copper
head
which
spewed
aromas
of
candied
malts
and
pine
the
sweet
malts
continued
to
dominate
the
taste
if
you
could
crystallize
and
sweeten
pine
sap
this
would
be
it
not
as
refreshing
as
i
had
thought
but
the
mild
carbonation
and
pleasant
warming
effect
make
it
a
solid
choice
decent
enough
drinkability
for
this
novelty
beer
though
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
overall
its
like
drinking
watered
down
sweet
spruce
sap
with
a
little
malt
kick
genius
its
like
a
refreshing

drinkability
this
is
decent
and
definitely
interesting
a
rather
unique
brew
a
pour
revealed
a
copper
body
sort
of
like
apple
cider
and
a
thick
creamy
head
the
aromas
are
faint
but
i
detect
some
pine
alcohol
and
a
sweetness
of
pineapple
there
is
a
slight
medicinal
taste
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
this
takes
away
from
the
overall
taste
which
is
a
sweet
malty
flavor
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
and
the
body
is
light
to
medium
a
good
beer
with
a
lot
of
history
behind
the
style
check
their
website
but
one
that
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
in
a
short
period
of
time
damn
i
love
these
heather
ales
pours
a
clear
copper
small
white
head

nice
spots
of
lacing
and
good
retention
smell
is
sweet
some
caramel
pine
herbs

taste
is
neat
sweet
fruity
almost
strawberry
herbs
some
medicinal
flavour
and
toffee
in
the
finish
smooth
sherry
like
alcohol
flavour
in
the
finish
almost
solventy
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
not
too
bad
brew
poured
to
a
dull
brown
color
with
an
amber
tint
to
it
had
no
real
head
and
what
it
did
have
disappeared
very
quickly
leaving
only
a
very
light
amount
of
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
strange
as
i
am
picking
up
a
candy
scent
which
seems
very
familiar
but
i
will
be
damned
if
i
can
put
a
name
to
it
i
noticed
that
others
said
they
picked
up
a
pine
scent
i
am
not
so
sure
i
am
finding
that
same
smell
the
taste
is
interesting
not
sure
i
would
say
it
is
my
cup
of
tea
but
has
some
interesting
highlights
a
nice
maltyness
is
the
underlying
flavor
with
a
spicy
twang
to
it
that
highlights
pepper
and
alcohol
mixed
again
this
brew
was
interesting
just
not
what
i
was
looking
for
i
guess
would
i
have
it
again
yeah
i
suppose
would
i
go
looking
for
it
no
doubt
it
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
of
camping
it
is
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
i
could
grow
to
love
the
style
either
i
guess
only
time
will
tell
pours
with
very
little
carbonation
and
not
much
head
either
color
is
a
dark
amberauburn
aroma
is
interesting
and
different
sweet
kind
of
fruity
with
strong
alcohol
smell
and
maybe
some
pine
taste
is
similar
with
lots
of
sweetness
alcohol
taste
and
a
warm
dark
flavor
near
the
finish
that
blends
into
what
i
think
is
the
spruce
mouthfeel
is
mediumthick
and
could
have
used
a
bit
more
carbonation
i
think
overall
pretty
good
beer
thats
different
and
worth
a
try
at
least
once
drinkability
probably
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
what
i
look
for
in
a
beer
an
everyday
beer
probably
not
but
very
interesting
and
worth
a
try
the
most
ponderous
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
i
think
i
love
gruit
good
to
try
but
it
just
wasnt
nearly
as
good
as
the
other
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
d
interesting
beer
but
one
is
plenty
poured
a
caramel
brown
color
with
head
that
did
not
sustain
too
long
malty
tasting
and
surprisingly
not
overwhelmingly
pine
tasting
it
was
worth
a
try
but
certainly
is
not
something
i
could
drink
more
then
one
of
once
every
blue
moon
like
i
said
worth
a
try
because
it
is
interesting
but
not
an
every
day
beer
oddly
malty
with
a
touch
of
peat
and
some
muted
pine
needles
in
the
background
rather
one
sided
and
unimpressive
i
was
expecting
to
be
overwhelmed
by
pine
so
was
a
bit
hesitant
but
its
not
overwhelming
at
all
just
a
mild
tasty
hint
was
noticeable
just
enough
to
give
it
a
pleasant
unique
character
i
had
it
as
a
nightcap
a
good
sipping
choice
this
beer
is
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
i
thought
some
spruce
and
pine
flavors
would
be
present
but
this
beer
was
suprising
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
a
tasty
beer
that
i
might
try
again
i
will
have
to
revisit
this
one
now
that
i
know
what
to
expect
what
a
find
flavors
are
balanced
and
unusual
a
winner
tasty
and
different
very
enjoyable
and
goes
down
easy
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
i
will
look
forward
to
drinking
this
one
again
this
was
nothing
like
the
offensive
pine
sap
i
thought
it
would
be
in
fact
i
thought
this
was
absolutley
delicious
it
poured
a
hazy
orange
bronze
colour
with
a
khaki
coloured
foamy
head
that
lasted
for
about
40
seconds
or
so
it
left
wonderful
looking
lacing
after
the
head
subsided
the
smell
was
very
sweet
much
sweeter
than
i
was
anticipating
the
pine
smell
was
extremely
muted
in
fact
i
really
had
to
look
for
it
the
taste
was
almost
that
of
a
slightly
sweet
ipa
it
wasnt
offensive
at
all
one
can
definitley
taste
the
barley
and
i
suppose
the
spruce
sprigs
are
what
lends
the
bitterness
too
this
brew
this
also
leaves
a
dry
earthy
taste
in
ones
mouth
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
with
very
little
carbonation
i
also
felt
that
drinkability
was
certainly
a
4
0
i
feel
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
nothing
at
all
like
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
about
the
only
thing
good
about
this
beer
was
its
appearance
and
the
fact
that
i
only
had
to
choke
down
a
12
oz
bottle
michael
jackson
describes
it
as
oily
peppery
and
medicinal
that
says
it
all
overwhelming
aroma
taste
and
finish
of
pine
leave
that
for
air
fresheners
im
sorry
to
say
that
in
35
years
of
beer
drinking
this
is
probably
one
of
the
5
worst
ive
ever
had
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
i
like
it
alot
not
much
of
a
pine
flavor
but
very
tasty
indeed
if
i
could
get
a
gift
pack
with
just
this
in
it
id
buy
a
bunch
of
them
amber
colored
body
interesting
aroma
of
candysweet
yeast
banana
and
a
hint
of
pinecones
flavor
follows
suit
but
is
quite
unique
as
the
pine
lingers
in
the
finish
not
so
much
an
overthetop
double
ipa
pine
flavor
but
a
bit
more
subtle
sticky
and
pine
sappy
rather
than
pine
needles
that
really
doesnt
make
sense
when
i
read
it
but
i
know
what
i
mean
ha
bubblegum
sweetness
lingers
on
the
palate
long
after
the
pine
sap
is
gone
malts
are
bready
and
toasted
carbonation
bites
the
tongue
but
is
not
too
overpowering
certainly
an
interesting
beer
something
like
a
brown
ale
crossed
with
a
belgian
tripel
and
a
bunch
of
pinecones
i
like
it
id
really
dig
this
style
more
come
the
colder
months
nonetheless
surprisingly
good
and
worth
a
try
if
you
can
handle
a
different
type
of
brew
great
drinkability
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
theres
good
clarity
to
the
deep
amber
body
of
this
brew
the
nose
i
swear
is
dominated
by
the
aroma
of
red
twizzlers
later
a
spicy
evergreen
element
creeps
in
the
taste
is
immediately
sweet
piney
with
candy
fruit
then
bitterness
and
sweet
malt
midpalate
the
aftertaste
is
piney
like
a
christmas
tree
and
a
little
floral
while
this
drinks
mostly
unobtrusively
its
really
more
of
a
curiosity
than
anything
youd
want
to
drink
repeatedly
better
than
bad
but
not
great
this
will
not
become
a
regular
drinker
really
unusual
and
probably
an
acquired
taste
interesting
to
try
once
in
a
while
i
do
notice
some
of
the
attributes
of
alaskan
winterale
in
this
beer
probably
because
they
are
both
flavored
with
spruce
tips
however
i
love
alaskan
winterale
this
one
i
am
not
so
sure
about
notes
this
beer
is
actually
quite
tasty
the
carbonation
was
very
low
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
the
malt
was
really
good
the
pine
was
well
balanced
and
the
7
5
alcohol
really
cant
be
tasted
over
all
i
liked
the
beer
i
however
attribute
this
to
its
novelty
ive
never
had
a
beer
like
this
before
but
then
again
i
am
just
getting
into
the
whole
drink
to
drink
thing
instead
of
the
drink
to
get
drunk
thing
any
feedback
on
how
to
get
to
know
beer
better
let
me
know
peace
d
if
you
can
get
over
the
bizarre
quality
of
this
beer
its
not
half
bad
this
is
a
unique
beer
but
over
the
top
sweet
for
my
likings
oh
and
this
is
my
100th
review
on
ba
yay
me
101
is
coming
up
shortly
definitely
a
good
inspiration
to
cast
the
net
widely
when
looking
for
different
beers
if
they
can
make
a
beer
this
good
without
hops
what
cant
they
do
wow
this
beer
is
extremely
sweet
not
sickly
sweet
but
more
like
candied
fruit
but
has
a
weird
aftertaste
the
tip
of
my
tongue
dries
very
quickly
you
can
definitely
taste
the
absence
of
hops
however
i
dont
detect
any
of
the
pine
and
spruce
used
to
make
it
a
quality
brew
that
would
be
enjoyed
slightly
warmer
and
with
a
pie
dessert
d
for
all
of
you
hopheads
out
there
this
beer
does
not
have
hops
so
dont
complain
about
the
lack
of
hop
presence
there
is
a
reason
for
that
that
aside
this
is
the
best
thing
to
come
of
scotland
since
hagis
well
actually
i
guess
this
is
the
best
thing
from
scotland
ever
definitely
the
only
thing
to
date
that
i
would
have
again
strong
smooth
and
soothing
it
is
best
at
room
temp
with
no
food
sessionable
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
more
of
these
in
one
setting
than
i
should
i
highly
encourage
everyone
to
seek
it
out
if
nothing
else
it
is
interesting
whoa
there
was
a
thread
a
while
back
that
asked
if
we
call
a
hop
lover
a
hop
head
what
do
we
call

the

a
very
nice
beer
overall
really
very
pleasing
and
i
can
see
why
this
beer
was
originally
brewed
to
slick
the
thirst
of
the
harvest
workers
fresh
light
and
crisp
this
is
a
really
good
drink
a
grand
slooter

a
good

for

taste
has
a

herbal
quality
to
it
along
with
the
toasted
biscuit
malts
and
clean
crisp
hops
gooseberry
and
wheat
they
promise
not
sure
how
much
of
either
i
picked
up
but
maybe
i
just
could
not
distinguish
it
did
have
a
uniqueness
to
it

loving
the
concept
as
described

fruity
somewhat
cloudberry
pear
and
tart
apricot
somewhat
toasty
bitterness
almost
turns
into
creaminess
late
in
the
drink
body
echoes
nearly
the
same
with
some
mushiness
that
the
carbonation
tries
to
prickle
up
a
decent
beer
to
pair
with
food
o
not
overly
impressed
but
it
is
a
very
subtle
drink
not
one
feature
dominates
with
that
said
i
expect
this
to
be
my
least
favourite
in
the
4pack
mainly
because
it
is
brewed
with
lager
malt
which
i
dont
have
a
good
palette
for
with
that
said
others
may
come
to
a
different
conclusion
overall
for
whatever
reason
i
just
didnt
really
enjoy
this
one
of
those
situations
to
me
at
least
where
the
sum
of
the
beer
was
less
than
the
individual
components
i
think
this
is
a
beer
worth
revisiting
as
i
feel
that
i
might
evaluate
this
differently
in
the
future
but
i
definitely
found
it
to
be
the
weakest
beer
of
the
sampler
pack
t
i
dont
know
kind
of
just
tastes
like
a
weak
wheat
ale
underwhelming
to
say
the
least
light
slightly
sour
wheat
note
that
kind
of
just
dies
some
grain
chalky
yeast
and
yeah
offtasting
wheat
thats
about
it
damn
it
the
taste
is
a
little
not
quite
watery
but
trending
in
that
direction
p
value
not
within
significance
but
i
cant
say
its
thin
because
it
actually
has
a
medium
to
chewy
body
which
i
find
quite
appealing
after
smelling
it
i
was
concerned
that
this
would
be
kind
of
stale
and
brackish
on
the
tongue
but
its
actually
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
i
find
myself
pleasantly
surprised
and
would
certainly
consider
it
again
best
when
served
really
cold
o
i
dont
get
much
difference
between
this
and
a
typical
fruity
wheat
ale
but
at
least
this
better
than
some
of
the
crappier
examples
of
the
style
due
to
the
fact
that
its
kind
of
pricey
for
what
it
is
i
probably
wont
get
this
again
o
very
crisp
tasty
beer
not
much
to
say
about
it
this
was
an
old
bottle
though
and
ill
reiterate
the
fact
that
i
would
love
to
get
a
fresh
one
just
gonna
have
to
take
a
tour
of
the
brewery
i
guess
a
good
light
ale
interesting
flavor
worth
trying
for
its
uniqueness
pretty
good
the
light
malt
and
restrained
hopping
complement
the
floral
fruit
flavours
without
overshadowing
them
the
label
describes
it
as
a
brew
designed
to
refresh
which
the
mildtasting
but
sour
gooseberry
will
certainly
achieve
the
lagering
process
adds
depth
to
the
beers
character
a
decent
effort
that
would
go
down
well
on
a
warm
day
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
enjoyable
and
certainly
not
bad
just
somehow
underwhelming
interesting
for
the
style
not
a
particularly
great
representation
of
the
style
but
it
still
works
on
its
own
worth
a
try
overall
interesting
beer
not
the
best
tasting
beer
ive
had
but
not
terrible
i
think
one
time
is
enough
i
found
this
to
be
a
great
beer
tons
of
character
and
appropriate
for
the
style

the
flavor
is
graham
cracker
and
pilsner
malt
with
a
light
fruity
tartness
as
well
as
a
large
amount
of
non
descript
spices
light
to
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
spicy
mouthfeel
another
one
that
is
quite
different
but
i
liked
it
the
sweetness
in
the
malt
works
well
with
the
high
level
of
spice
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
o
a
unique
ale
that
has
a
heavy
sour
flavour
that
provides
for
a
unique
experience
but
i
can
imagine
would
only
appeal
to
a
unique
palette
glad
i
tried
it
though
not
certain
its
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again

this

a

grozet
gooseberry
wheat
ale
is
a
respectable
offering
but
not
a
very
memorable
one
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
with
a
slight
touch
of
herbs
and
berries
a
borderline
bland
base
with
nearly
enough
accents
to
make
it
interesting
but
not
quite
getting
there
the
wheat
malt
and
herb
flavours
actually
do
work
quite
well
together
and
its
certainly
quite
drinkable
but
i
doubt
ill
be
clamoring
for
another
any
time
soon
im
not
sure
what
gooseberries
are
supposed
to
taste
like
but
i
do
know
that
using
more
probably
would
have
made
this
a
bit
more
interesting
ill
give
this
brew
a
thumbs
up
but
its
a
wavering
sort
of
one
probably
not
worth
picking
up
on
its
own
but
not
a
bad
inclusion
in
this
sampler

d
i
dont
know
what
this
would
be
like
fresh
but
with
a
lot
of
time
on
it
its
quite
tasty
o
overall
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
isnt
particularly
interesting
either
williams
brothers
referring
to
this
as
a
wheat
ale
sets
expectations
that
arent
in
line
with
the
true
style
this
specialty
is
more
of
a
curiosity
than
a
musttry
but
it
is
well
executed
and
very
drinkable
light
drinkable
beer
but
a
full
5
abv
this
is
my
favourite
from
this
taster
pack
so
far
o
its
okay
tastes
good
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
dessert
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
m
light
body
with
a
slight
bit
of
chew
light
to
moderate
carbonation
the
feel
is
light
as
i
would
expect
its
both
crisp
and
smooth
but
each
mildly
and
a
bit
more
of
either
would
make
for
a
livelier
sip
as
it
is
its
easy
to
drink
and
is
semidry
straddling
the
fence
a
bit
for
some
reason
i
thought
this
beer
would
be
much
sweeter
but
then
i
have
to
remember
it
is
from
scotland
is
there
anything
thats
fairly
sweet
tasting
from
scotland
will
try
more
beers
from
the
william
brothers
this
one
was
interesting
to
say
the
least
gotta
try
some
actual
gooseberries
and
try
this
beer
fresher
too
overall
not
a
shabby
beer
at
all
this
is
leftover
from
a
sampler
i
gave
somebody
will
have
to
try
the
other
traditional
scottish
ales
from
williams
centuries
old
beer
styles
can
still
be
enjoyed
today
amongst
other
styles
overall
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
wine
cooler
with
the
flavors
it
has
its
light
smooth
and
easy
enough
to
drink
just
not
something
id
want
again
i
noticed
the
long
neck
bottle
was
mostly
empty
in
the
neck
so
i
felt
cheated
out
of
a
shot
of
beer
poured
a
2
offwhite
head
of
medium
life
the
body
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
touch
of
orange
the
smell
is
very
light
just
a
hint
of
tart
fruit
the
taste
is
pretty
interesting
with
gooseberry
tartness
up
front
and
malted
wheat
in
the
midpalate
and
then
an
acidic
grassiness
in
the
finish
o
a
very
nice
drinkable
light
and
airy
beer
not
much
to
write
home
about
here
but
its
nothing
to
complain
over
either
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
going
into
it
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
good
flavor
good
balance
and
highly
sessionable
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
colour
collar
of
soapy
white
head
light
lace
on
the
glass
smell
has
strong
fruity
notes
berries
i
guess
gooseberry
floral
biscuity
malt
is
present
but
second
or
third
string
to
the
floral
and
fruity
scents
that
come
off
of
this
taste
is
grassy
and
herbal
initially
berries
in
the
form
of
blackberry
and
raspberry
biscuity
malt
with
a
long
fruity
finish
lightmed
carbonation
medium
body
decent
weight
overall
this
was
ok
not
outstanding
by
any
stretch
but
refreshing
and
drinkable
would
maybe
have
this
again
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
not
something
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
poured
out
much
like
any
other
wheat
beer
the
color
was
hazy
gold
in
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
lightly
fruity
with
a
nice
light
aroma
of
wheat
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
little
fruity
but
nothing
overpowering
the
grainy
flavors
of
wheat
and
some
malt
make
this
beer
pretty
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
it
had
a
light
body
also
overall
it
was
a
fun
beer
to
try
but
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
other
beers
from
the
williams
brothers
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
the
pilsner
style
with
the
depth
and
body
character
of
an
ale
despite
the
fact
that
the
flavors
are
lacking
the
real
experience
here
is
in
the
mouthfeel
and
aroma
of
the
beer
i
will
definitely
be
having
this
one
again
odd
beer
but
nice
appears
with
lively
small
bubbled
carbonation
very
pale
golden
body
with
a
thicket
of
white
head
forming
and
lasting
nicely
fine
speckled
lacing
lines
in
layers
around
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
a
distinct
berry
jam
nose
with
some
sharp
wheat
additions
some
green
herbal
additions
are
noticeable
as
well
flavor
is
interesting
a
big
spicy
layer
combined
with
a
sharp
wheat
beer
notes
and
finishes
with
sweet
jam
with
the
gooseberries
actually
the
best
tasting
and
most
complex
beer
from
the
3
of
the
4
ive
had
so
far
mouthfeel
does
have
lively
carbonation
lighter
bodied
but
not
watery
and
finishes
with
an
herbal
dryness
not
bad
overall
i
really
like
this
unique
twist
on
a
wheat
beer
with
fruit
additions
and
herbal
spiciness
to
balance
it
all
out
this
is
the
most
adventurous
on
the
palate
and
diverse
in
flavors
unique
and
very
pleasant
refreshing
and
drinkable
pours
gold
with
a
bit
of
a
yellow
tinge
to
it
brilliant
clarity
but
almost
resembling
a
macro
lager
nice
semisoapy
white
head
and
good
retention
nose
has
some
berry
evident
cant
pin
this
one
down
as
gooseberry
as
this
is
my
first
experience
with
the
berry
some
light
grass
wet
wood
cereals
and
general
grain
notes
cant
really
pick
up
the
wheat
here
taste
follows
along
the
same
trail
more
grassy
herbal
and
earth
notes
with
the
berry
as
well
i
guess
gooseberry
takes
on
some
blackberrycurrant
characteristics
again
i
cant
seem
to
find
the
wheat
here
but
the
malts
is
more
cerealy
and
crackery
light
mouthfeel
and
a
carbonation
that
resmebles
a
macro
a
decent
beer
my
girlfriend
liked
this
more
than
i
did
thought
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
definitely
unique
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
ale
that
still
has
a
lot
of
character
and
a
satisfying
earthiness
started
off
a
bit
funky
but
really
opened
up
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
d
a
unique
refreshing
and
easydrinking
gruit
thats
very
accessible
compared
to
more
alien
examples
of
the
style
by
the
same
token
though
its
less
complex
and
sensual
than
other
gruits
ive
only
ever
seen
it
in
the
gift
packs
the
lcbo
stocks
around
winter
but
itd
be
wonderful
in
warmer
weather
very
light
very
crispy
very
refreshing
theres
almost
a
light
bitter
side
to
this
beer
that
comes
midway
through
the
finish
its
a
decent
beer
though
nothing
is
terribly
notable
about
it
id
say
its
worth
taking
a
shot
at
michael
jackson
mentioned
it
in
his
great
beer
guide
moreys
bottom
line
with
the
grape
flavor
and
lower
carbonation
this
beer
almost
taste
like
wine
to
me
if
you
are
a
wine
lover
youd
probably
enjoy
this
one
a
good
introduction
beer
for
your
wine
drinking
friendsfamily
o
the
flavour
was
sourbitter
without
much
else
to
compliment
it

this
a
very
tasty
beer
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
session
beer
outside
of
the
american
pilsner
market
very
easy
drinking
beer
very
average
brew
and
pretty
lacklustre
although
it
has
a
few
interesting
upturns
that
give
a
bit
of
a
surprise
d
pretty
distinctive
taste
not
sure
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
but
it
is
definitely
a
great
try
pours
cloudy
with
a
mild
amount
of
setament
havs
a
very
mild
aroma
and
only
nice
a
mild
hint
of
spices
very
like
sweetness
with
wheat
and
finished
with
a
nice
spice
and
hoppness
and
smooth
finish
dark
nice
amber
color
and
a
mild
caramel
taste
very
good
and
unquie
beer
o
from
reading
the
description
i
thought
this
beer
would
be
pretty
bad
but
quite
the
contrary
definitely
recommended
od
nice
floralberry
mix
not
too
bad
an
interesting
different
blend
o
nothing
too
amazing
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
see
myself
getting
this
again
or
recommending
it
interesting
to
try
but
would
not
want
this
as
a
daily
drink
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
hazy
copper
with
big
chunks
of
sediment
floating
around

people
like
this

dont

dissipating

with
a
strong
scent
of
what
i
assume
is
gooseberry
ive
never
tasted
a
gooseberry
but
this
is
a
gooseberry
beer
after
all
d
sort
of
a
hybrid
of
pears
lemon
zest
blueberry
and
mango
distinctive
layers
in
the
taste
starts
very
pungent
with
fruit
described
in
the
aroma
a
bit
of
funk
and
a
little
spice
in
the
middle
with
some
citrus
hops
coming
through
and
then
a
final
little
unexpected
blast
of
sweet
sour
which
is
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
crisp
and
dry
light
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
seems
like
itd
probably
skunk
pretty
badly
if
left
sitting
around
good
beer
doverall
this
is
a
nice
beer
the
spices
and
wheat
were
well
balanced
and
this
was
very
drinkable

representation
of
this
style
pours

light
golden
color

a

thin

no

some

any

some
gooseberry

that

that
sort

good
an
interesting
concoction

an
historic

well
worth
the
adventure
the
cpj
i
was
looking
forward
to
something
different

might
stretch
my
palate
a
bit
but
it
was
not

this

the

would
be
a

a

could
actually
be

this

certainly
is

the

this

very
faint

what
the

do
to
this
beer
all
i
am
getting
is
a
hoppy
pale
lager
some
earthy
tones
in
the
finish
but
i
feel
as
though
this
beer
fell
flat
not
bad

nothing

and
drink
stuff
from
this
brewery
all

long
ideal
barbecue

would
be
great
on
a
mediterranean

but
i
like
my
beers
to
have
a
bit
more
body

flavours
taste
is

very
characterful
with
subtle

it
has
full

light
zesty

light

that
is
stronger
at

balancing
it
at

after

are

down
but
it
is
extremely

definitely
worth
a

for
the

d
i
always
enjoy
trying
new

styles
this
was
fun
the
beer
is
enjoyable
though
one
is
plenty
it
wasnt
my
favorite
by
any
means
but
the
experience
was
worth
it
d
its
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
and
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
rather
sessionable
i
would
definitely
consider
having
this
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
witbier
but
wanted
a
different
flavor
than
orange
peels
i
got
this
as
a
bottle
in
a
mixed
four
pack
i
wish
theyd
sell
all
of
their
portfolio
in
sixpacks
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
some
dryness
and
tart
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
a
tasty
beer
i
suppose
but
lacking
in
anything
particularly
interesting
decent
but
not
great
an
interesting
brew
similar
to
a
light
pale
ale
but
with
enough
unique
characteristics
to
make
it
enjoyable
looking
forward
to
the
rest
beautiful
light
orange
lightly
hazy
with
a
thick
white
head
with
great
retention
the
nose
has
a
bright
gooseberry
tartness
and
light
caramel
sweetness
no
hops
but
the
sourness
does
add
a
a
lot
of
character
to
this
beer
some
juniper
as
well
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
mild
tartness
not
very
gooseberry
like
with
heather
and
juniper
mild
sweetness
with
caramel
and
honey
drying
on
the
finish
with
tartness
and
heather
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
an
a
long
lasting
finish
with
tartness
and
honey
this
beer
is
quite
exceptional
notes
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
and
an
easy
one
to
drink
compared
to
the
other
beers
they
make
that
use
more
unusual
ingredients
this
one
is
a
bit
more
tame
there
is
definitely
a
fruity
flavor
but
it
doesnt
overpower
the
drink
which
is
nice
the
flavors
are
a
little
thin
for
me
but
they
are
nice
this
is
nice
light
easy
drinking
fruity
beer
nice
flavors
although
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
depth
and
complexity
to
it
but
good
nonetheless
personally
i
expected
more
of
a
gooseberry
tang
up
front
but
the
gooseberry
is
nearly
absent
interesting
not
offensive
but
not
something
memorable
slightly
hazy
pineapple
juice
yellow
with
a
fizzy
and
fast
dissipating
white
head
sweetish
and
mild
aroma
of
bread
malts
lemon
and
tart
fruit
ive
never
actually
had
gooseberries
before
but
i
think
i
taste
them
now
no
chemical
aftertaste
so
i
assume
its
natural
of
course
the
ingredients
list
says
gooseberries
and
not
extract
or
artificial
flavour
aside
from
the
sweet
fruit
flavour
its
a
little
bit
tangy
and
shows
some
faint
hopping
in
the
finish
its
inoffensive
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
feels
thin
and
watery
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
a
whole
lot
more
in
the
middle
of
july
pours
a
clear
strawamber
with
an
active
bubbly
foam
of
white
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
behind
the
smell
has
a
vague
sweetness
to
it
along
with
notes
of
berries
brown
sugar
cloves
spices
and
citrus
the
taste
attempts
to
follow
but
the
gruitstyle
spices
dull
the
citrusy
and
sweet
flavors
replacing
them
with
a
middling
melange
of
herbal
and
spicy
notes
the
overall
taste
resembles
a
bitter
piece
of
old
pineapple
or
the
inside
of
an
orange
peel
luckily
the
moderate
body
and
carbonation
and
slick
feel
allow
this
brew
to
rise
above
its
lackluster
flavor
to
maintain
a
decent
degree
of
drinkability
overall
though
an
unimpressive
gruitstyle
brew
this
brew
pours
a
pale
straw
colour
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
one
finger
head
and
very
sporadic
lacingthe
aroma
is
quite
sweet
with
hints
of
wheatlemongrass
and
gooseberriesit
has
an
average
mouthfeel
with
quite
a
sweet
grassyfruity
taste
to
it
with
tastes
of
sweet
wheat
and
grains
and
also
at
the
end
i
get
a
little
bittersweet
hit
of
gooseberries
mixed
with
hopsalthough
this
beer
is
no
standout
its
very
easy
to
drink
especially
on
a
nice
hot
day
like
today
light
body
to
the
point
of
being
watery
extremely
light
beer
theres
nothing
really
there
whether
good
or
bad
its
drinkable
but
there
is
just
nothing
to
love
or
hate
about
this
one
inoffensive
to
a
fault
conclusion
an
odd
little
number
but
pretty
tasty
overall
a
solid
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
my
guess
would
be
this
is
how
beer
was
served
for
quite
a
long
time
the
taste
reminds
me
so
much
of
a
good
pilsner
though
not
as
hoppy
has
a
pleasant
herbal
quality
that
is
not
too
strong
good
for
swilling
on
a
spring
afternoon
goes
down
easy
pretty
tasty
mild
no
aftertaste
i
seem
to
be
a
minority
voice
on
the
grozet
i
am
also
counted
among
the
dissenters
for
the
ederberry
and
heather
offering
as
well
an
interesting
beer
worth
trying
the
ingredients
list
hops
i
always
thought
that
what
classified
a
gruit
was
the
absence
of
hops
a
fairly
simple
beer
lacking
any
real
depth
or
complexity
but
definitely
something
out
of
the
ordinary
drinkability
i
dont
think
that
grozet
is
ever
going
to
be
an
everydaytype
beer
for
me
but
it
is
quite
tasty
and
original
final
thoughts
if
this
is
representative
of
gruit
beer
then
sign
me
up
this
beer
was
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
and
has
left
me
looking
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
pack
my
thumb
is
way
up
on
this
one
however
i
would
be
naive
to
say
it
is
for
everyone
this
beer
would
have
been
excellent
training
wheels
in
my
youth
to
beer
as
a
whole
overall
an
interesting
and
unusual
beer
but
nothing
really
popped
out
the
gooseberries
were
great
and
balanced
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
but
i
think
they
could
have
been
a
bit
more
pronounced
1
down
and
3
to
go
from
the
historic
ales
pack
and
this
one
despite
being
mediocre
makes
me
look
forward
to
trying
the
rest
gonna
put
drinkablity
above
average
id
have
another
if
i
had
one
around
not
sure
how
the
staying
power
would
be
after
a
second
but
overall
id
buy
this
again
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
mild
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
a
spicy
aftertaste
its
plenty
drinkable
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
for
its
uniqueness
flavor
is
mostly
that
of
a
wheat
beer
carbonation
is
not
adding
anything
to
the
flavor
some
belgium
character
as
well
reminds
me
a
lot
of
loft
ale
from
new
belgium
the
beer
finishes
with
a
mild
aftertaste
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
lightly
carbonated
and
light
bodied
drinkability
it
was
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
i
think
i
tatsed
the
gooseberries
but
i
have
never
tasted
gooseberries
before
a
great
summer
beer
and
very
drinkable
a
unique
take
on
the
style
d
very
sessionable
and
a
perfect
hot
weather
beer
great
complexity
give
it
a
try
the
flavours
of
gooseberry
etc
act
only
as
minor
footnotes
and
suspend
the
belief
that
this
must
really
have
been
what
ancient
scottish
gruit
was
like
by
making
a
most
average
ordinary
beer
out
of
a
unique
traditional
style
serves
only
to
extend
the
problem
this
brewery
means
to
solve
grozet
way
ween
people
onto
more
diverse
styles
but
it
wont
convince
them
theyre
worth
drinking
or
saving
or
that
theyre
all
that
special
poured
a
darker
than
expected
hazy
amber
color
with
a
scant
whitish
head
smells
decent
enough
somewhat
sweet
but
there
is
this
lingering
funk
that
i
cant
seem
to
put
my
finger
on
not
like
a
sour
funk
just
funk
funk
taste
is
flat
really
flat
some
weird
malty
tastes
really
no
sweetness
i
dont
really
know
what
to
make
of
this
mf
is
thin
and
watery
with
no
carbonation
geez
i
mustve
gotten
a
really
bad
bottle
kinda
disappointed
since
ive
been
eyeing
this
one
for
a
while
guess
ill
have
to
get
this
one
again
finish
is
extremely
soft
and
really
smooth
with
a
soft
bite
on
the
back
end
drinkability
this
beer
is
good
but
not
great
in
my
humble
opinion
it
is
something
i
could
drink
again
but
i
feel
there
are
better
beers
out
there
a
nice
apertif
to
pair
prior
to
a
dinner
course
that
will
consist
of
farmhousestyle
ales
e
g
saison
this
makes
for
a
nice
but
logical
reasonable
transition
on
the
palate
the
sweet
and
tart
gooseberries
are
refreshing
but
this
is
really
a
novelty
beer
d
an
interesting
drink
and
its
nice
to
see
a
brewer
trying
to
recreate
these
ancient
celtic
ales
d
a
pretty
good
beer
though
i
do
wish
the
grains
had
been
a
stronger
focus
at
the
end
of
the
day
grozet
is
just
one
big
hodgepodge
of
spices
and
herbs
hitting
a
wide
range
of
flavors
but
missing
the
note
when
it
comes
to
malt
moderate
carbonation
and
a
medium
light
body
make
this
otherwise
refreshing
beer
more
satisfying
after
reading
the
other
reviews
i
think
my
bottle
of
grozet
just
aged
too
long
the
bottle
has
a
november
2008
best
before
marking
but
i
guess
a
lot
can
happen
in
three
months
there
was
zero
froth
lacing
retention
or
anything
of
the
sort
the
beer
had
some
carbonation
but
tasted
a
bit
flat
it
was
slightly
hazy
maybe
a
little
dirty
water
golden
in
color
the
nose
is
floral
a
bit
grainy
perhaps
a
bit
of
grape
skin
or
vinous
qualities
the
taste
is
just
too
flat
and
thin
to
be
overly
interesting
im
getting
some
sweet
berry
flavors
presumably
the
gooseberry
some
hop
in
the
background
this
is
just
too
thin
a
touch
on
the
tart
side
a
bit
of
a
vinous
grape
skin
quality
as
the
nose
would
indicate
i
think
i
will
need
to
try
this
with
a
freshness
date
within
the
proper
range
quite
refreshing
and
i
certainly
enjoyed
it
too
bad
it
was
the
last
bottle
in
the
city
of
coor
lite
and
clam
d
i
could
def
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
maybe
in
the
woods
interesting
for
sure
definitely
worth
trying
for
the
historical
experience
and
the
nice
superdry
finish
d
interesting
and
i
could
probably
have
one
anytime
but
this
probably
wouldnt
displace
traditional
hefes
and
witbiers
from
my
typical
wheat
beer
rotation
drinkability
this
has
a
different
taste
than
other
beers
i
have
tried
there
is
just
enough
to
know
the
beer
is
from
scotland
as
it
has
a
light
scottish
ale
taste
i
could
drink
several
because
of
its
uniqueness
d
interesting
for
sure
definitely
worth
trying
for
the
historical
experience
and
the
nice
superdry
finish
i
can
imagine
sitting
in
a
16th
century
scottish
alehouse
and
getting
belligerently
drunk
on
this
oldtime
brew
a
fun
novelty
beer
to
try
if
youre
feeling
adventurous
give
this
one
a
try
how
often
do
you
see
an
ale
brewed
with
gooseberries
one
of
these
was
enough
for
me
could
it
be
a
session
ale
not
unless
you
really
like
gooseberries
a
sweet
vienous
quality
really
nice
unique
mouthfeel
a
slight
sour
tartness
a
really
nice
brew
not
a
session
brew
but
a
couple
of
these
a
year
would
be
a
treat
d
this
has
a
great
balance
for
not
having
hops
if
you
enjoy
authentic
scotch
ales
this
will
be
great
for
you
this
beer
pours
a
pale
amberorange
color
the
head
is
small
and
there
is
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
gooseberry
floral
hops
heather
and
faint
caramel
the
taste
is
maltier
than
the
aroma
with
a
lot
more
heather
and
some
gooseberry
the
mouthfeel
has
a
wonderful
silky
soft
texture
with
appropriately
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
it
is
flavorful
nuanced
and
easy
drinking
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
clean
moderate
carbonation
and
a
low
to
medium
body
this
is
a
really
great
beer
it
would
go
really
well
with
chicken
or
fish
id
say
id
love
to
have
this
with
a
lemon
chicken
or
lemon
pepper
salmon
steak
great
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
small
pure
white
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
faint
some
honey
malt
and
a
nondistinct
berry
scent
the
taste
is
of
sweet
and
sour
berries
a
flowery
spice
profile
and
an
earthy
bitterness
the
flavors
arent
bold
but
are
quite
unique
and
work
well
together
good
range
the
feel
is
light
with
almost
flat
carbonation
finishes
fairly
crisp
and
dry
quite
the
unique
fruit
wheat
ale
a
nice
change
of
pace
if
you
want
an
herbal
brew
with
a
different
berry
flavor
notes
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
certainly
i
dont
feel
like
its
a
beer
that
would
get
tiring
over
the
course
of
the
night
i
appreciate
the
subtle
mosslike
tones
and
the
balance
fruit
beers
make
me
nervous
about
sweetness
but
this
one
is
in
check
i
would
like
a
little
more
carbonation
though
d
not
a
bad
ale
and
would
be
very
refreshing
outside
on
a
hot
day
very
cool
to
try
a
historic
beer
style
like
this
an
interesting
take
on
a
wheat
beer
the
gooseberries
add
a
decent
mix
of
sweetness
and
sourness
to
the
flavor
the
wheat
seems
well
balanced
its
smooth
and
drinkable
this
ale
does
not
taste
like
a
typical
fruit
beer
enjoyable
but
again
not
an
ordinary
ordeal
d
highly
drinkable
not
too
complex
overall
a
mellow
ale
delicate
flavor
and
an
alternative
when
something
lighter
is
called
for
a
bit
thin
but
smooth
gentle
carbonation
pretty
cool
that
it
doesnt
seem
ancient
or
extreme
in
any
way
could
be
a
pleasant
wheat
beer
for
any
brewpub
pours
a
straw
yellow
and
peachy
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
of
wheat
malt
fermented
fruit
and
berries
almost
a
bit
of
chemical
winelike
fumes
and
funk
the
ingredients
listed
include
malted
barley
bree
wheat
gooseberries
bogmyrtle
and
hops
tastes
wheaty
and
sweet
like
wild
berries
and
fruit
maybe
even
the
slightest
tinge
of
dark
fruitraisin
involved
and
a
light
astringent
bitterness
felt
in
the
back
of
the
throat
fairly
sessionable
with
light
flavors
and
a
light
to
moderate
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
dont
let
the
oddness
of
this
brew
intimidate
you
its
pretty
easygoing
pours
up
a
clear
solid
gold
color
with
basically
no
head
the
nose
is
very
faint
subtle
berries
gooseberries
a
lil
wheat
taste
of
gooseberries
wheat
subtle
spice
in
the
finish
light
bodied
low
carbo
this
is
definately
a
unique
and
sessionable
brew
so
this
is
the
third
beer
from
the
ancient
beers
of
scotland
mix
pack
i
got
enjoying
it
in
a
hefeweizen
glass
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
wee
head
that
melts
quickly
smell
is
sweet
and
floral
with
some
honey
and
what
i
guess
are
gooseberries
taste
is
suspiciously
like
their
heather
ale
hmmmm
that
sweet
floral
taste
with
some
honey
mixed
in
but
mot
that
dried
flower
pedal
aftertaste
like
the
heather
ale
goes
down
fairly
smooth
with
a
tongue
coating
quality
id
say
a
good
after
dinner
treat
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
overall
a
very
nice
and
slightly
different
brew
as
i
said
this
would
make
and
excellent
summer
beer
well
worth
a
try
very
drinkable
and
good
recommended
drinkability
not
very
common
beer
in
the
scottish
gruit
style
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
a
little
yeasty
and
sweet
with
a
decent
malt
finsih
a
very
smooth
brew
mostly
a
frtuiy
wheat
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
but
i
thought
id
be
getting
more
not
sure
why
nobody
on
this
site
seems
to
favor
this
one
too
highly
its
one
of
my
favorite
warmweather
brews
easy
drinking
with
a
bit
of
a
flowery
nose
and
a
sweet
start
to
the
tongue
before
opening
up
to
something
more
complex
its
fun
to
take
the
tastebuds
on
a
history
tour
as
well
this
is
a
decent
fruity
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
a
go
d
this
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
but
its
medicinal
qualities
limit
its
overall
drinkability
it
starts
out
pleasant
enough
but
there
is
a
lingering
quality
of
bitter
chalky
herbs
that
makes
me
less
than
eager
to
go
in
for
another
sip
it
was
interesting
to
have
it
once
but
i
dont
see
any
reason
to
ever
have
another
one
of
these
pours
a
clouded
gold
with
minimal
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
nose
is
like
berries
and
leaves
i
dont
know
exactly
what
gooseberries
are
like
but
i
am
sure
that
is
what
i
am
getting
from
the
fragrance
flavor
is
inky
and
sweet
with
a
mild
but
nice
berry
flavor
feel
is
pretty
standard
definitely
drinkable
but
of
course
is
very
unique
might
not
be
for
all
but
i
certainly
like
everything
this
brewery
puts
out
tastes
clean
and
refreshing
i
have
never
had
gooseberries
but
i
think
thats
what
i
taste
along
with
wheat
and
some
malt
another
different
experience
from
a
brewery
that
i
enjoy
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
this
really
isnt
a
beer
that
i
would
prefer
to
drink
too
many
the
flavor
just
didnt
appeal
to
me
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
very
little
head
smells
of
some
faint
floral
spices
but
im
not
sure
what
they
are
taste
is
very
mild
can
taste
some
of
the
spices
in
it
but
not
very
pronounced
and
the
gooseberry
that
was
almost
non
existent
possibly
some
tartness
from
them
but
not
much
of
anything
in
spite
of
it
being
a
fairly
bland
and
average
beer
i
could
easily
see
this
as
a
summer
quencher
because
it
is
so
light
in
body
and
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
very
easy
to
drink
and
certainly
enjoyable
although
i
expected
more
tartness
from
the
gooseberries
not
as
unique
as
the
ingredients
promise
but
still
a
solid
interesting
beer
give
it
a
whirl
pours
a
nice
golden
with
a
slightly
cloudy
look
a
small
bit
of
head
and
little
lacing
but
not
bad
for
a
bottled
wheat
beer
it
has
a
nice
scent
a
very
sweet
wheat
with
a
slight
fruit
tang
excellent
taste
a
nice
malty
wheat
beer
with
an
excellent
unique
gooseberry
flavor
along
with
some
nice
hints
of
spices
most
notably
what
i
pick
up
to
be
coriander
goes
down
very
well
and
is
a
great
ale
well
chilled
i
could
toss
an
armload
of
these
back
anoter
winner
from
the
scots
i
usually
do
not
like
fruit
in
my
beer
per
se
but
the
tartness
the
gooseberries
added
made
it
rather
enjoyable
not
something
i
could
or
would
drink
every
day
but
worth
keeping
a
bottle
or
two
around
highly
recommended
d
nothing
too
complex
but
still
an
interesting
highly
drinkable
beer
shame
ive
only
seen
it
at
one
place
500
ml
bottle
at
blackfriars
glasgow
as
grozet
lagered
celtic
ale
abv
is
5
0
brewed
with
crushed
gooseberries
golden
colour
slightly
hazy
moderate
head
nice
aroma
of
hops
and
gooseberries
lagerish
flavour
drank
it
too
cold
though
with
moderate
but
decent
hops
and
notes
of
gooseberries
d
this
was
a
very
different
brew
rather
easy
to
drink
certainly
more
tasty
when
its
real
cold
like
that
the
fruit
flavor
was
subdued
worth
a
try
overall
impression
thirst
quenching
beer
i
dont
know
what
a
gooseberry
taste
like
but
this
beer
to
me
could
pass
as
being
brewed
with
heather
tips
instead
of
hops
great
beer
well
brewed
but
not
on
of
those
fruit
beers
that
i
would
crave
12oz
bottle
from
rons
translucent
amber
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
offwhite
head
berry
dominates
the
aroma
a
sweet
and
sour
berry
flavors
come
through
with
the
flavor
with
hints
of
malt
lighter
in
body
but
not
thin
the
berry
is
far
from
simple
or
bland
and
it
combines
with
the
drinkability
in
this
beer
to
make
it
a
good
easy
drinking
tasty
beer
overall
this
is
very
intriguing
beer
its
tasty
and
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
im
not
really
familiar
with
the
style
but
its
enough
to
get
me
interested
in
exploring
other
examples
drinkabilty
it
was
definitely
a
sipper
it
got
better
as
i
went
along
d
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
for
anyone
who
has
enjoyed
the
supremely
sour
gooseberry
off
of
the
bush
another
fine
example
of
how
hops
arent
required
to
brew
interesting
and
drinkable
ale
as
well
as
the
grainy
tastiness
of
this
scottish
brewery
definately
worth
trying
12
oz
bottle
color
of
dark
straw
with
a
white
head
nose
of
straw
grass
floral
clove
and
maybe
soft
berry
quality

taste
of
yeast
wheat
some
fruitberry
blue
and
slight
sourness
body
is
mild
refreshing
and
with
light
carbonation

aftertaste
of
wheat
grasses
some
fruitberry
blue
and
refreshing
looks
like
a
cideryellow
alone
no
sharpness
in
aroma
however
a
touch
of
wheat
adn
the
myrtle
like
a
tea
no
real
visible
head
malted
and
wheat
so
no
edge
indescribeable
tea
taste
with
a
faint
apple
not
too
drinkable
but
worth
the
experience
to
see
what
people
can
brew
a
bit
of
an
odditynovelty
for
a
beer
not
something
id
take
on
a
regular
basis
but
worth
a
try
now
and
then
surely
peculiar
pours
a
clean
light
golden
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
spotty
lacing
in
the
tall
pilsner
glass
nose
is
predominantly
malty
with
some
sweet
fruit
and
citrus
notes
going
on
over
all
though
i
expected
a
bolder
nose
for
this
one
there
is
just
not
much
here
the
palate
is
right
along
with
the
nose
unfortunately
quite
malty
up
front
with
some
notes
of
green
apple
pear
and
grape
not
very
berry
at
all
all
the
flavors
here
are
very
subtle
leaving
this
beer
oddly
thin
and
uninteresting
to
me
definitely
not
a
challenge
to
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
thin
too
thin
slightly
bitter
and
only
lightly
carbonated
finishes
dry
i
feel
like
i
should
appreciate
this
beer
more
given
its
ancient
origins
but
this
one
is
just
wholly
uninteresting
to
me
i
had
high
expectations
and
maybe
i
put
too
much
into
them
but
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
maybe
worth
trying
once
to
say
you
did
but
i
didnt
find
much
of
anything
here
that
is
unique
or
particularly
worth
seeking
out
by
the
way
what
exactly
is
bree
after
the
first
few
sniffs
and
tastes
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
beer
but
i
liked
it
the
more
time
i
spent
with
it
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
with
that
very
dry
after
taste
that
i
mentioned
before
the
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
but
im
not
sure
id
have
more
than
one
in
a
single
sitting
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
the
beer
isnt
anything
special
to
look
at
overall
a
decent
beer
this
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
other
offerings
ive
tasted
from
the
brewers
at
heather
ale
but
i
love
the
experimenting
attitude
of
this
brewery
and
attempts
at
reviving
archaic
recipes
and
ingredients
i
prefer
their
elderberry
pine
and
heather
ales
but
this
one
isnt
bad
either
cheers
drinkability
im
not
sure
this
is
weird
um
this
beer
pours
very
cloudy
but
is
light
golden
in
color
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
as
one
might
expect
from
a
gooseberry
beer
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
very
tart
but
that
is
almost
overpowered
by
the
sweetness
which
hits
after
the
fruit
it
is
a
very
smooth
with
a
farily
light
body
im
not
sure
i
would
drink
this
again
but
it
was
pretty
good
drinkability
is
good
it
doesnt
really
have
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
alcohol
but
theres
lots
of
malt
and
a
nice
light
fruity
sweetness
really
interesting
beer
that
im
definitely
enjoying
overall
a
good
conversation
beer
but
little
else
good
malt
character
but
overly
thin
worth
a
try
nice
color
on
the
pour
thick
head
sticky
sweet
aromas
battle
with
grassy
notes
some
medicinal
characteristics
not
too
sweet
though
the
berry
flavor
is
strong
not
sure
if
its
the
berries
or
some
added
wheats
or
herbs
but
there
is
a
pleasing
sourness
on
the
finish
comes
off
dry
but
refreshing
pleasing
balance
the
best
of
the
multipack
from
this
brewer
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
bubbly
white
head
aroma
of
bubblegum
and
maraschino
cherries
taste
was
sour
gooseberries
and
other
berry
flavours
lots
of
grapefruit
and
sourness
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
astrigently
dry
a
little
puckering
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
still
a
very
unique
and
refreshing
character
subtle
citrus
nose
with
spicy
notes
light
and
slightly
carbonated
refreshing
almostl
lemony
a
tangy
balance
with
an
unexpected
complexity
very
drinkable
whats
a
gooseberry
drinkability
different
but
refreshing
another
nice
one
from
this
very
interesting
brewery
a
clear
golden
pour
with
no
head
interesting
sweet
nose
with
lots
of
berry
and
wheat
very
little
carbonation
that
changed
the
flavor
as
it
waned
it
started
sweet
and
had
hints
of
cranberry
sour
at
the
end
after
taste
left
me
wanting
to
drink
more
i
like
sour
beers
though
good
summer
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
simple
overall
i
dont
know
why
this
sample
was
lacking
carbonation
every
else
smelled
and
tasted
normal
i
will
chalk
it
up
to
a
bad
sample
and
move
on
thank
god
i
love
gooseberries
which
was
well
displayed
in
this
case
not
too
strong
and
not
too
weak
if
i
can
get
a
guaranteed
fresh
and
carbonated
bottle
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
the
overall
drinkability
is
ok
but
would
only
drink
this
beer
occasionally
definitely
not
a
session
beer
not
a
beer
that
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
interesting
brew
goldenamber
body
with
a
frothy
head
decent
retention
smell
of
cereal
some
fruit
and
of
a
lager
it
doesnt
have
a
skunk
smell
but
heinekin
came
to
mind
after
the
smell
body
is
light
to
medium
taste
of
malt
some
mild
tartness
and
a
light
hop
bitterness
an
average
beer
fairly
drinkable
smells
a
little
like
mary
juana
and
tastes
a
little
like
id
imagine
it
would
taste
yeah
yeah
im
the
last
homo
sapien
who
hasnt
done
the
weed
or
pill
thing
hence
my
miraculous
ability
to
say
nothing
of
substance
about
the
taste
of
beer
oh
well
what
a
funky
little
beer
nothing
like
the
other
two
heather
beers
ive
had
a
foggy
medium
color
with
a
synergy
of
bitter
and
sweetness
accompanied
by
a
menthol
like
face
plate
that
straps
you
in
for
the
ride
whether
you
like
it
or
not
it
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
never
really
had
a
goosenberry
beer
before
but
kinda
liked
it
a
dominant
wheat
character
sets
the
tone
of
the
beer
but
the
berries
give
a
rich
and
bold
twist
smells
sweet
with
lemons
cloves
and
with
the
berries
giving
a
grape
licorice
aroma
tastes
rich
with
bready
yeasty
lemons
bannanas
cloves
and
with
the
same
rich
berry
taste
that
gives
a
complex
raison
blackberry
sweetness
spiciness
and
tartness
the
berries
give
off
a
character
similar
to
belgian
strong
dark
malts
interesting
but
odd
in
a
wheat
beer
feels
rich
and
creamy
but
cut
nicely
by
the
tart
berries
sweet
and
tart
in
the
finish
interesting
but
just
a
little
too
unusual
to
rate
highly
the
brewer
has
obviously
acheived
their
objective
of
mingling
native
sctotish
herbsplants
with
traditional
brews
very
nice
delivery
its
most
distinguishing
characteristic
is
its
uniqueness
not
really
my
thing
a
little
too
herbal
and
medicinal
for
my
personal
taste
but
thats
to
be
expected
for
style
worth
drinking
for
something
different
drinkability
surprisingly
drinkable
a
tad
on
the
light
side
perhaps
but
its
still
flavorful
and
interesting
so
the
lightness
helps
drinkability
if
anything
this
is
not
as
rich
as
the
same
brewers
fraoch
heather
ale
but
certainly
a
pleasant
and
interesting
diversion
from
the
normal
ales
i
quaff
all
in
all
a
very
good
ale
with
a
unique
flavor
that
is
pretty
smooth
an
interesting
brew
and
quite
enjoyable
nice
for
a
change
of
gears
once
and
a
while
overall
this
beer
is
unusual
and
interesting
worth
the
experience
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
pallet
not
to
bad
overall
would
enjoy
drinking
this
again
very
different
you
can
check
my
other
reviews
and
see
that
i
do
indeed
enjoy
good
and
interesting
and
exotic
beers
not
this
one
tastes
more
herbal
then
anything
almost
tealike
with
some
grapeish
qualities
sweet
at
first
before
turning
slightly
tart
it
finishes
kind
of
dry
malts
and
wheat
seems
to
be
somewhere
in
there
as
well
but
the
herbal
tea
quality
of
thism
is
definitely
the
most
dominate
flavor
fairly
drinkable
with
a
smooth
mediumbody
pale
golden
light
straw
colored
in
appearance
head
is
evanescent
aroma
is
notably
fruity
up
front
estery
and
vinous
with
hints
of
green
apples
pears
and
green
grapes
herbal
qualities
to
the
nose
as
well
as
a
bit
of
grass
some
pale
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
as
the
typical
wheat
aroma
along
with
very
slight
yeastiness
flavor
is
smooth
up
front
but
the
grainy
wheat
comes
in
quickly
coupled
with
a
lingering
bready
malt
flavor
that
is
felt
more
than
tasted
overall
impression
of
the
flavor
is
its
herbal
quality
fruit
comes
in
a
flash
of
sweetness
but
quickly
moves
to
a
slighly
acidic
flavor
that
lasts
into
the
aftertaste
causing
a
minor
drying
effect
along
with
a
bit
of
sourness
much
more
tealike
than
winelike
a
bit
of
spiciness
balances
the
acidity
and
mixes
with
the
returning
wheat
flavor
another
interesting
ancient
brew
from
heather
ale
taste
very
herbal
with
a
somewhat
weet
profile
from
the
gooseberries
the
wheat
doesnt
quite
stand
out
as
much
as
i
would
have
liked
and
theres
a
strange
aftertaste
that
i
cant
quite
place
that
im
not
really
enjoying
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
and
the
aftertaste
makes
this
a
bit
hard
for
me
to
drink
this
is
something
that
i
wont
be
seeking
out
again
11
2
oz
bottle
pours
a
murkey
oranged
khaki
color
with
just
a
minimal
head
that
falls
to
sparse
wisps
over
top
of
the
brew
this
one
is
pretty
hazy
with
no
apparent
carbonation
nose
is
definately
fruity
what
i
have
to
assume
is
gooseberry
with
a
light
spiceyness
playing
in
there
flavor
is
a
nice
blend
between
a
good
fruityness
that
fades
to
a
moderately
creamy
and
lightly
spicey
wheat
character
i
dont
think
that
gooseberry
is
ever
going
to
be
a
favorite
fruit
in
my
book
as
the
flavor
is
just
not
my
bag
it
doesnt
seem
flawed
i
just
dont
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
could
feel
is
moderate
with
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
id
like
a
little
more
bubble
in
this
one
as
it
would
add
some
sharpness
that
i
think
would
work
well
with
the
flavor
overall
this
one
is
okay
i
dont
think
i
would
do
gooseberries
in
a
beer
but
if
i
hadnt
tried
this
one
id
never
know
that
good
show
for
giving
it
a
try
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
will
go
back
to
this
one
mouthfeel
was
thin
moderately
carbonated
and
just
bland
not
drinkable
for
me
i
had
to
pass
this
one
off
to
my
mom
who
liked
it
lots
otherwise
it
wouldve
been
a
drain
pour
d
this
has
to
be
the
most
unique
beverage
that
ive
ever
had
and
i
have
no
idea
as
to
what
to
think
about
it
yet
is
it
bad
no
is
it
good
im
not
sure
is
it
worth
trying
absolutely
d
well
it
isnt
hard
to
drink
but
there
really
isnt
much
to
it
the
flavor
is
weak
but
if
it
were
any
stronger
it
wouldnt
be
pleasant
at
all
the
smell
would
be
nigh
unbearable
if
it
were
stronger
i
would
get
sick
of
it
after
a
few
a
subpar
beverage
this
is
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
was
quite
unique
especially
with
the
gooseberry
flavor
moderately
amber
in
color
very
sweet
smelling
gooseberries
are
immediately
noticeable
the
berries
are
also
heavily
noticeable
in
the
taste
and
the
finish
is
citrusy
a
nice
brew
nothing
spectacular
this
would
be
nice
in
the
summer
as
it
is
quite
refreshing
i
had
good
expectations
for
this
one
and
they
were
surprisingly
met
this
is
a
good
brew
for
all
seasons
light
and
refreshing
with
enough
body
and
character
to
keep
your
palate
interested

with
just
a
hint
of
the
wily
and
elusive
gooseberry
this
particular
berry
flavor
follows
through
more
in
the
flavor
and
balances
the
bitterness
from
the
herbs
oh
so
very
nicely
dry
and
grassy
at
first
but
does
yield
quite
a
strong
malt
profile
considering
the
other
flavors
going
on
here
reminds
me
very
much
of
heavyweights
juhlia
and
even
moreso
a
real
snakebite
like
youd
get
in
a
real
irish
pub
complete
with
the
black
currant
on
top
though
certainly
not
that
sweet
carbonation
is
a
bit
lacking
but
id
barely
noticed
due
to
the
overall
enjoyment
factor
im
getting
from
this
quite
refreshing
and
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
one
which
id
certainly
quaff
innumerable
amounts
cheers
to
the
scots
poured
a
slightly
hazy
medium
amber
color
with
modet
white
head
that
rapidly
fell
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
very
difficult
to
describe
at
first
i
thought
it
had
a
winelike
scent
then
again
maybe
it
was
limelike
maybe
this
is
what
a
goosebeery
smells
like
i
like
it
but
im
not
sure
why
taste
is
very
ordinary
with
maybe
some
medicinal
notes
very
unique
finish
is
very
thin
and
a
the
flavor
quickly
dissapears
an
ok
beer
but
not
really
something
to
try
again
d
fruit
aroma
is
enticing
easily
approachable
not
too
filling
and
not
too
fruity
drinkability
i
think
this
is
the
first
time
i
can
say
ive
had
gooseberries
before
even
though
technically
its
not
physical
gooseberries
still
a
beer
that
id
suggest
to
try
as
this
is
not
something
you
encounter
every
day
but
its
good
tasty
and
thirst
quenching
its
always
good
to
keep
your
taste
buds
in
check
and
flexible
too
this
didnt
really
come
together
for
me
a
little
to
sweet
and
cloying
bet
you
it
went
like
gang
busters
a
few
100
years
ago
not
something
id
drink
on
regular
basis
but
great
to
try
and
definitely
worth
looking
up
for
something
different
clear
clear
clear
golden
color
pretty
but
a
bit
boring
smells
like
stale
cigarettes
with
lemon
yeah
so
um
taste
better
but
better
isnt
really
good
tastes
like
dirt
stinky
cigaretteinfused
dirt
mouthfeel
feels
kinda
dirty
too
grainy
and
not
smooth
not
that
drinkable
it
just
its
dirt
this
is
beer
dirt
dirt
beer
yech
and
its
fresh
it
says
its
fresh
this
must
be
a
big
burly
man
scot
beer
d
easy
to
drink
good
everyday
beer
if
it
was
easier
to
findcheaper
this
beer
isnt
going
to
spur
the
microbrewed
grozet
revolution
but
its
interesting
notes
i
find
this
one
both
unusual
and
highly
unique
im
glad
that
i
tried
it
once
but
im
not
sure
id
revisit
it
for
awhile
in
spite
of
the
high
drinkability
i
usually
prefer
something
with
more
complexity
however
any
beer
aficionado
should
give
it
a
shot
especially
if
you
can
find
the
whole
gift
set
its
included
in
not
a
bad
beer
not
great
ill
try
the
kelpie
next
and
continue
to
let
the
style
work
on
me
this
is
definitely
a
slammer
its
not
real
complex
and
i
would
personally
like
more
of
everything
but
for
the
style
its
damn
good
recommended
d
personally
i
find
it
very
interesting
but
not
so
much
as
enjoyable
almost
like
fermented
juice
wo
the
sweet
edge
need
to
try
more
of
its
kind
to
get
used
to
it
i
suppose
not
much
to
look
at
but
this
a
prime
example
of
not
judging
a
book
by
its
cover
recommended
this
is
a
good
spiced
ale
from
heather
its
definitely
worth
a
try
very
unique
and
good
use
of
unconventional
ingredients
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
afternoon
it
is
not
a
session
beer
but
one
that
i
would
enjoy
again
in
the
future
keep
it
up
alewives
an
very
interesting
different
and
yet
well
crafted
beer
pours
pale
yellow
in
apperance
with
absolutely
no
head
aroma
is
of
dough
and
bread
and
wheat
i
sure
dont
taste
any
gooseberry
in
this
beer
taste
is
thin
without
much
substance
a
bit
of
cardboard
taste
maybe
a
hint
of
cinammon
or
other
spice
beer
indicates
that
it
is
good
to
2008
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
age
or
mellow
this
much
more
as
it
is
already
pretty
docile
appearance
was
a
clear
gold
almost
khaki
color
for
a
lager
i
was
surprised
by
the
head
retention
very
full
and
lingering
had
a
delicate
fruity
smell
that
was
very
subtle
initial
taste
was
a
very
faint
fruit
with
a
surprising
hop
finish
smooth
on
the
mouth
but
the
unfamiliar
fruit
taste
requires
some
adjustment
not
sure
i
would
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
session
but
definitely
worth
a
try
a
very
interesting
lager
beer
i
found
it
hard
for
me
to
drink
this
beer
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
it
was
just
a
beer
that
wasnt
very
appealing
to
my
tastes
this
beer
can
be
at
best
described
as
ok
its
not
worth
2
59
a
11
2
bottle
its
basically
very
close
to
hefewiezen
with
some
subtle
differences
looks
a
hazy
yellow
smells
of
some
sweet
wheat
the
taste
is
wheat
malt
with
some
different
flavors
in
there
some
sweet
gooseberries
its
good
and
i
would
get
it
if
was
cheaper
but
its
too
subtle
to
comand
that
price
with
a
shot
just
dont
except
anything
that
different
or
anything
grozet
gooseberry
wheat
ale
good
use
of
an
ampersand
is
a
wonderful
example
of
the
gruit
style
some
may
find
it
bland
and
uninteresting
but
i
respectfully
disagree
this
is
yet
another
beer
from
the
brewery
craigmill
that
ive
found
to
be
fascinating
and
remarkably
drinkable
perhaps
after
a
few
more
bottles
ol
robbies
verse
will
start
to
make
sense
not
very
impressed
by
this
one
ive
yet
to
have
a
spiced
ale
from
the
uk
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter
that
has
impressed
me
despite
not
going
in
with
any
expectations
i
think
ill
give
this
style
a
wide
berth
from
now
on
clean
finish
a
slight
alcohol
residue
definitely
will
have
again
another
cellared
bottle
from
my
stash
so
ill
try
and
compensate
for
its
age
at
least
4
years
old
pours
a
dark
murkish
brown
with
a
thin
head
there
is
a
nice
berry
smell
the
taste
shows
a
slight
amount
of
oxidation
and
a
malt
character
that
has
deepend
berry
taste
is
slightly
too
sweet
for
gooseberries
but
then
it
becomes
more
tart
toward
the
finish
any
hop
character
is
severly
diminished
but
i
could
have
thought
there
were
other
bittering
agents
at
work
interesting
and
id
say
its
aged
out
pretty
well
hazy
caramel
colour
with
a
thin
white
lace
of
foam
herbal
aroma
with
some
malt
slightly
hidden
also
some
white
winelike
grape
grainy
malt
flavour
and
sweetness
grapes
perfumy
character
quite
crisp
finishes
dry
with
fruitiness
and
slight
bitterness
low
carbonation
medium
body
initially
crisp
from
the
carbonation
but
becomes
more
slick
towards
the
finish
interesting
unique
brew
to
say
the
least
lots
of
flavour
and
quite
drinkable
pretty
boring
overall
i
will
stick
to
this
brewerys
heather
ale
which
i
really
enjoy
body
is
medium
with
tiny
bubbles
lending
to
a
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
an
interesting
and
tastey
brew
worth
checking
out
the
tiny
bubbles
make
for
a
very
nice
and
creamy
mouthfeel
in
the
end
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
ever
enjoyed
the
fruit
spice
and
beer
flavorscharacters
are
all
there
in
just
the
right
balance
while
the
flavors
are
complex
with
more
to
discover
with
each
sip
its
also
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
is
quite
enjoyable
to
drink
sometimes
complex
beers
just
are
too
much
of
a
workout
for
the
palate
to
drink
casually
but
this
one
can
be
both
deeply
appreciated
and
simply
enjoyed
bottle
poured
a
light
hazy
brown
color
ale
with
a
nice
beige
foamy
head
with
pretty
good
retention
aroma
of
gooseberries
is
easily
detectable
along
with
some
malt
and
weird
spices
sweetness
is
overwhelming
and
well
balance
with
the
malt
nice
refreshing
drink
with
some
originality
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
that
is
slightly
chill
hazed
with
a
14
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
wheat
malt
scent
that
is
enhanced
with
gooseberries
and
a
herbal
aroma
this
is
a
not
a
typical
brew
aroma
but
it
isnt
a
bad
one
either
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
fruity
pale
wheat
flavor
with
berries
in
the
finish
as
well
as
a
herbel
aftertaste
that
is
dry
and
earthy
this
seems
like
a
nice
alternative
to
the
usual
beer
this
is
a
brew
for
the
ladies
or
on
the
hot
summer
day
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
gruit
ale
it
has
good
flavor
and
aroma
a
good
drinker
an
unusual
and
enjoyable
beer
which
would
work
very
well
indeed
as
a
refresher
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
thats
a
little
darker
at
the
top
there
is
very
little
head
even
when
poured
directly
into
the
glass
interesting
lacing
big
bands
that
stay
there
even
after
you
have
begun
sipping
the
smell
is
weak
but
hints
at
fruits
andor
berries
not
much
carbonation
the
taste
is
flat
as
well
there
are
subtleties
of
berries
gooseberries
i
presume
but
nothing
that
jumps
out
at
you
so
nothing
that
could
be
called
anything
special
gclarkeage
was
correct
in
saying
that
it
had
a
tealike
quality
and
that
it
is
very
smooth
but
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
this
would
be
a
great
beer
if
you
wanted
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
something
light
and
arent
looking
for
anything
that
is
too
hard
to
swallow
actually
pretty
enjoyable
if
this
is
the
case
taste
malty
almost
cookiedough
sweet
wheaty
with
a
slightly
acidic
fruity
finish
just
about
no
carbonation
not
too
shabby
for
a
primitive
hefe
but
ill
stick
with
the
mordern
version
easy
drinking
ale
with
an
enjoyable
flavour
drinkability
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
a
great
lightly
fruited
taste
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
imo
will
be
going
back
for
more
of
these
my
favorite
type
from
this
brewery
although
the
seaweed
ale
and
the
pine
scots
are
also
quite
refreshing
too
overalli
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
it
was
not
stupendous
grozet
pours
a
hazy
barn
straw
colour
head
is
almost
a
violent
sea
foam
thickness
one
finger
thick
and
everlasting
not
much
lace
just
a
little
bit
of
foam
that
sticks
to
the
glass
smells
more
like
a
wine
than
a
beer
a
dry
fruit
scent
mixed
with
berries
and
heather
their
is
a
malt
presence
as
well
which
is
the
only
indication
my
nose
detects
of
this
being
an
ale
now
for
taste
i
must
warn
this
is
my
first
time
having
anything
gooseberry
and
ive
come
to
the
conclusion
i
dont
like
gooseberries
so
i
must
say
i
dont
like
the
taste
however
this
is
supposed
to
have
the
gooseberry
flavour
so
i
wont
give
it
a
low
score
simply
for
containing
something
i
dont
like
would
it
be
fair
to
give
an
iipa
a
low
score
if
the
reviewer
hates
a
hoppy
flavour
no
strong
gooseberry
taste
i
find
anyways
dry
wine
flavour
as
well
reminds
me
of
a
good
red
wheat
barley
and
a
bit
of
heather
and
honey
as
well
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
a
little
granular
drinkability
is
tough
for
the
same
reason
taste
was
tough
would
i
drink
this
again
i
doubt
it
unless
i
aquire
a
taste
for
gooseberries
personally
id
give
drinkability
a
1
5
but
i
gotta
keep
in
mind
the
style
of
beer
this
is
ill
give
it
a
three
why
well
if
it
wasnt
for
the
gooseberry
thats
what
id
give
this
beer
and
if
ever
i
do
get
an
appreciation
for
gooseberries
ill
edit
this
review
accordingly
mouthfeel
like
the
taste
is
light
not
much
body
or
carbonation
at
all
drinkability
though
is
very
high
but
im
not
sure
why
anyone
would
want
to
have
many
of
these
im
happy
to
check
out
new
styles
but
there
really
is
not
a
lot
of
good
things
i
can
say
about
this
beer
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
think
i
prefer
a
heavier
beer
most
of
the
time
but
this
was
an
excellent
drinking
experience
the
taste
was
definitely
different
this
is
definitely
a
wheat
tasting
beer
along
with
a
slight
flavor
of
hops
and
herbs
at
first
then
sweettart
fruits
and
a
finally
long
a
vinious
dry
hoppy
finish
it
was
wonderfully
complex
though
one
of
these
is
all
i
could
drink
at
a
sitting
tastes
of
wheat
malt
is
quite
dry
and
crisp
finish
is
sour
and
lightly
pineyfloral
i
am
guessing
the
odd
taste
at
the
end
is
the
gooseberry
not
a
bad
flavor
really
but
where
is
the
rest
of
this
beer
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
interesting
but
leaves
me
cold
theres
not
much
to
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
lacking
beer
is
flat
this
is
my
reward
beer
for
taking
the
gre
today
purchased
as
part
of
a
sampler
heather
ale

for

99
color
is
hazy
goldenorange
with
light
frothy
head
i
can
smell
the
gooseberry
in
the
aroma
makes
the
beer
smell
a
little
like
juice
or
flavored
tea
taste
is
slightly
but
enjoyably
tart
probably
the
effect
of
the
gooseberry
not
much
of
a
malt
presence
but
some
nice
herbal
flavors
mouthfeel
initially
has
some
bite
but
finishes
very
smoothly
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
for
tonight
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
decent
white
head
that
left
some
trace
amounts
of
lacevery
effervesent
spelling
aroma
like
a
spring
meadow
along
with
a
touch
of
citrus
very
pleasing
to
the
nose
taste
is
delicate
lightly
sweet
with
a
lightly
toasted
grain
note
a
little
tart
in
the
finish
but
light
this
would
be
a
good
summer
refresher
i
think
light
and
delicate
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
what
starts
off
as
a
bland
tasting
fruit
tinged
wheat
beer
suddenly
pops
with
what
is
presumeably
the
fruity
flavour
of
gooseberries
sort
of
like
tart
grapes
has
a
bit
of
a
sour
finish
light
body
moderate
carbonation
not
really
my
sort
of
thing
the
feel
is
a
little
thin
but
still
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
im
still
trying
to
figure
out
what
a
gooseberry
is
pours
out
a
cloudy
pale
urine
color
with
virtually
no
head
the
aroma
is
a
subtle
wheat
with
a
fruity
background
the
taste
is
definately
different
and
i
am
not
so
sure
that
is
a
good
thing
this
time
there
is
nothing
as
far
as
taste
goes
it
is
extremely
flat
tasting
and
the
wheat
presence
almost
seems
rotten
and
stale
there
is
a
bit
of
sourness
followed
by
a
dry
earthy
dirttextured
taste
i
cannot
think
of
anything
positive
to
say
about
it
glad
that
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
style
of
beer
but
my
god
this
stuff
is
pretty
bad
very
interesting
and
refreshing
i
found
myself
enjoying
this
i
was
rather
excited
to
try
this
one
as
much
as
i
love
the
wheat
beers
poured
a
very
cloudy
amber
color
no
head
just
some
little
bubbles
around
the
edge
it
looked
thick
like
a
really
good
apple
cider
you
know
the
kind
you
get
on
those
side
stands
in
the
mountains
smelled
sweet
fruit
like
appleish
but
not
apples
i
thought
the
taste
would
be
as
cool
but
yuck
very
tangy
almost
spoiled
tasting
like
spoiled
green
apples
with
pepper
lots
of
carbonation
but
wheres
the
head
not
a
good
feeling
in
the
mouth
i
cant
help
but
wonder
if
this
beer
is
any
good
its
expiration
date
is
june
of
this
year
but
surely
its
still
good
i
let
this
sit
on
the
counter
and
it
got
somewhat
warm
it
is
a
little
better
than
cold
but
i
think
im
going
to
have
to
dump
this
one
down
the
drain
man
what
a
dissapointment
i
think
ill
try
somethiing
else
light
bodied
very
different
and
interesting
but
not
something
id
drink
very
often
light
and
easily
drinkable
for
kids
of
all
ages
a
good
pleasant
flavor
wheat
notes
and
malt
hints
fruit
subleties
that
go
from
sweet
to
a
slight
tartness
in
the
finish
if
it
were
sweeter
and
not
so
thin
not
that
it
is
watery
it
could
be
a
desert
beer
i
do
not
think
i
would
have
this
with
a
meal
maybe
some
cheese
or
pie
hard
to
describe
the
aroma
of
this
beer
tangy
and
citric
im
tempted
to
say
lemony
but
thats
not
quite
it
bright
and
lively
flavor
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
pretty
sweet
but
there
was
just
a
tinge
of
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
red
berry
in
the
middle
a
little
powdery
at
the
end
and
a
fairly
pronounced
bittersweetness
that
meshed
well
with
the
fadeout
of
the
berry
notes
unlike
any
wheat
or
fruit
beer
ive
had
an
interesting
excursion
sampled
42904
overall
its
certainly
interesting
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
im
looking
forward
to
the
other
brews
in
the
pack
but
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
in
the
near
future
love
my
wife
but
the
other
beers
in
the
boxed
set
were
better
the
finish
has
an
odd
tinge
to
it
more
like
a
juice
than
a
beer
refreshing
looking
goldenorange
with
good
splotchy
lace
and
a
softjust
capping
head
of
snowy
somewhat
creamy
white
aromas
are
at
once
both
fruity
and
malty
redolent
of
peaches
and
cream
medium
bodied
with
a
tangy
lively
tartness
that
is
cleansing
lingering
and
very
refreshing
this
brew
exhibits
a
winey
character
with
elements
of
new
zealand
sauv
blancgooseberry
malted
hot
cereal
with
butter
some
red
fruits
and
creamy
peach
flavors
round
out
the
taste
profile
i
like
this
as
it
is
very
unique
complex
and
satiating
this
beer
might
be
past
its
date
so
take
this
review
with
that
in
mind
it
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
some
sediment
present
it
formed
a
small
foamy
off
white
head
that
left
trace
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
hops
herbs
wine
and
possibly
gooseberries
the
flavor
was
of
hops
wine
and
gooseberry
the
finish
was
a
bit
sour
and
astrigent
not
as
good
as
the
heather
or
the
elderberry
but
a
newer
batch
might
prove
better
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
this
brewerys
odd
offerings
too
many
bitter
flavors
going
on
here
and
i
cant
even
identify
the
culprits
i
compliment
the
brewery
for
experimenting
with
these
ancient
styles
and
i
will
continue
to
try
these
certainly
this
is
ale
is
one
that
is
not
mainstream
and
might
be
worth
a
try
interesting
to
try
but
doesnt
get
me
worked
up
in
any
way
a
really
enjoyable
drink
and
probably
my
favorite
besides
the
fraoch
from
heather
ales
as
usual
for
heather
ale
this
is
an
unusual
beer
from
the
bottle
to
the
smell
and
taste
best
before
date
is
october
2004
ingredients
are
listed
as
malted
barley
bree
wheat
gooseberries
bogmyrtle
meadowsweet
hops
to
be
honest
i
have
no
clue
what
bogmyrtle
or
meadowsweet
is
always
ready
for
a
new
experience
i
pour
it
its
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
small
layer
of
fine
yeast
at
the
bottom
the
white
head
is
fairly
thin
but
leaves
a
trace
on
top
to
the
end
the
smell
is
assertively
fruity
but
not
overly
sweet
it
also
has
an
interesting
herbalmedicinal
smell
the
taste
is
vaguely
berrylike
but
the
flavor
sort
of
lingers
on
the
back
end
the
hops
and
herbs
battle
on
the
tongue
for
attention
although
its
a
nice
experiment
its
not
the
type
of
beer
most
people
will
want
to
sit
and
drink
all
day
a
very
different
type
of
brew
cloudy
unfiltered
light
cider
appearance
minimal
lacing
some
fruity
bouquet
with
grapefruit
and
grape
aromas
taste
was
different
fruity
then
tart
on
the
finish
medium
body
refreshing
mouthfeel
was
good
with
the
lightly
tart
finish
giving
it
a
rounded
quality
easy
enough
to
drink
though
a
few
would
be
just
about
right
as
the
flavor
is
just
a
bit
unusual
drinkability
buy
it
if
you
see
it
its
that
good
also
this
is
the
first
time
outside
of
a
dictionary
that
ive
seen
the
word
convivial
used
it
was
printed
on
a
little
blurb
on
the
label
i
showed
it
to
a
few
people
and
we
all
got
a
good
kick
out
of
it
this
is
a
relatively
ordinary
looking
pale
lager
in
colour
and
characteristics
the
smell
might
lead
to
some
early
suspiscions
of
something
odd
going
on
here
something
which
is
reinforced
by
the
first
taste
of
which
there
are
two
distinct
parts
as
other
reviews
have
noted
an
initial
grassy
wheatish
even
taste
and
as
it
makes
its
way
to
the
back
of
your
mouth
and
throat
there
is
quite
a
change
spices
and
goosberries
whatever
they
are
or
taste
like
begin
to
make
their
presence
felt
to
sum
up
a
tasty
and
different
beer
although
i
must
admit
not
quite
as
bizarrely
different
as
i
might
have
hoped
i
might
not
have
liked
it
half
as
much
but
i
wish
theyd
left
the
hops
out
that
would
have
been
really
interesting
drinkability
for
certain
reasons
lower
a
nice
beer
in
some
ways
but
in
other
ways
it
also
makes
you
say
why
it
would
probably
make
a
good
apretif
with
some
shellfish
or
other
seafood
and
cheese
a
curiousity
i
recommend
pours
a
hazy
straw
colored
liquid
with
a
very
thin
lace
on
the
goblet
the
aroma
of
corn
is
paired
with
a
peppery
berry
a
dominant
yeast
flavor
starts
off
the
brew
with
a
lemony
wheat
spice
the
entire
impression
of
the
ale
is
that
of
a
clean
and
refreshing
balanced
brew
very
easy
drinking
and
tasty
with
a
peppery
berry
finish
drinkability
worth
a
shot
on
cask
if
you
see
it
i
cant
honestly
say
the
beer
is
better
for
the
treatment
not
anything
worth
seeking
out
regardless
i
had
no
problems
finishing
the
pint
i
was
given
and
could
have
had
another
but
i
thought
i
should
turn
in
okay
this
ones
a
little
hard
to
describe
pours
a
pale
orange
color
with
a
deep
haze
very
slight
almost
nonexistant
head
big
balloonlike
bubbles
near
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
amazing
very
fruity
but
hard
to
place
the
citrus
twang
of
a
wheat
beer
is
evident
in
the
aroma
and
taste
but
its
subtle
theres
a
floral
mix
in
the
aroma
too
i
mean
truely
floral
like
a
flower
shop
tangy
perfumy
and
soft
truly
unique
and
an
absolute
blast
to
experience
this
confuses
me
because
unlike
scots
pine
the
grozet
does
not
contain
pine
or
spruce
sprigs
the
only
ingredient
common
to
the
two
is
malted
barley
bree
so
perhaps
thats
the
associating
taste
thx
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
another
if
this
brew
had
some
continuity
it
would
be
a
real
winner
source
liquid
solutions
a
bit
cloudy
and
honey
color
big
head
that
quickly
goes
down
to
a
skimmer
across
the
top
smell
is
nothing
special
smells
as
i
would
think
it
would
fruity
with
a
bit
of
honey
thrown
in
there
taste
is
mellow
with
no
harsh
aftertaste
not
a
strong
flavor
nor
a
light
one
at
that
good
taste
goes
down
easy
could
easily
drink
this
with
no
problem
one
after
the
other
not
one
of
those
beers
that
after
drinking
one
that
you
are
too
full
to
drink
anymore
shockingly
smooth
going
down
however
considering
the
flavor
and
i
do
indeed
taste
a
hint
of
gooseberry
so
bonus
points
for
that
perhaps
not
destined
to
be
on
my
standard
drinking
list
but
certainly
something
i
might
reach
for
on
special
occasions
a
vigorous
pour
yielded
2
fingers
of
white
froth
atop
a
hazy
honey
colored
ale
has
a
starchy
muskiness
to
its
aroma
with
slight
citrusy
wheat
note
head
has
settled
down
quickly
and
retains
abit
with
lacing
mouthfeel
is
rather
flat
feeling
with
a
slight
dryness
flavor
is
completely
unusual
and
a
bit
unpleasant
a
bit
sour
and
earthy
with
a
staleness
added
to
it
im
not
sure
if
ill
finish
this
one
or
not
not
a
good
tasting
brew
the
highlight
for
me
is
clearly
the
aroma
its
hazed
light
appearance
is
an
obvious
prelude
to
the
slightly
wheaty
refreshing
characteristics
but
the
nose
is
where
its
at
an
exotic
mix
of
lemon
lemon
balm
and
rotting
berries
delights
the
senses
and
comes
in
waves
to
be
savored
and
contemplated
the
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
chewing
on
lemon
grass
and
drinking
chamomile
herbal
tea
leaves
a
slight
cottonmouthish
feeling
the
body
is
thin
and
slightly
anemic
a
little
more
carbonation
and
body
would
carry
this
really
unique
beer
into
the
stratosphere
note
old
bottle
tasted
medium
brown
color
slightly
cloudy
small
head
aroma
is
fruity
more
applish
than
berrish
a
light
bodied
wheat
more
apple
cider
like
than
beer
no
real
malt
or
hop
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
fruity
after
notes
were
taken
i
noticed
the
best
by
date
was
oct
2000
this
beer
was
tasted
nearly
30
month
after
that
date
will
need
to
retaste
with
a
fresh
beer
overall
im
really
not
sure
what
to
say
about
this
beer
it
was
deffinatly
interesting
ale
meets
cider
meets
lambc
not
what
youd
expect
in
my
notes
i
wrote
gross
but
interesting
as
if
someone
picked
two
styles
of
beer
to
mix
together
that
shouldnt
be
mixed
its
not
bad
but
i
probably
wont
be
reaching
for
this
on
again
nose
of
buttery
whole
wheat
and
charred
alpine
cheese
there
is
a
smart
sunny
tartness
that
lifts
the
ample
maltiness
and
creates
detailed
delicate
balance
after
sniffing
at
it
for
ten
minutes
from
a
wine
glass
there
does
in
fact
emerge
a
subtle
smell
of
sweet
thickskinned
black
berry
it
is
an
enigma
the
more
i
focus
on
it
the
less
obvious
it
becomes
a
slight
smoky
graphite
flavor
emerges
later
too
clean
hazel
dry
dry
thanks
to
johynnyduvel
for
the
reunion
for
the
bjcp
style
experimental
or
historical
beer
id
peg
this
around
4
55
its
very
well
done
it
has
the
appearance
of
apple
juice
thats
not
good
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
and
im
glad
i
experienced
a
gooseberry
ale
in
my
life
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
anytime
soon
it
has
a
variety
of
flavors
but
they
dont
blend
the
best
i
taste
grains
and
a
tartness
to
this
beer
the
gooseberries
were
definitely
recognized
esp
in
the
aftertaste
this
tasted
better
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
overall
a
decent
not
terrific
beer
overall
different
top
marks
for
recreating
this
brew
style
and
i
hope
it
continues
to
be
brewed
so
that
others
can
try
this
auld
scots
beer
recipe
but
i
for
one
will
not
be
seeking
or
even
drinking
this
one
again
though
its
just
not
to
my
taste
to
be
honest
rather
disappointing
330
ml
bottle
best
before
date
of
june
2004
overall
my
least
favorite
of
the
heather
ale
products
grozet
has
the
least
amount
of
complexity
and
character
of
their
products
imho
grozet
is
way
to
thin
for
a
recreation
of
a
500
year
old
scotch
monastic
brew
my
hat
is
off
to
heather
ale
for
their
attempts
of
keeping
historic
brewing
methods
and
ingredients
alive
but
this
one
needs
to
be
reworked
imho
overall
impression
an
interesting
beer
no
doubt
but
to
be
honest
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
it
i
really
enjoy
their
alba
scots
pine
ale
and
the
heather
ale
so
my
expectations
were
high
worth
a
try
though
you
might
like
it
a
light
ale
and
a
bittersweet
mead
this
is
definitely
different
from
what
youd
normally
pick
up
at
the
gas
station
its
not
something
that
id
drink
every
day
but
definitely
something
that
id
think
back
to
from
time
to
time
and
remember
fondly
pour
is
pale
golden
with
a
small
white
head
quickly
diminishing
to
nothing
aroma
is
fruity
and
sweet
hints
of
banana
flavor
is
mildly
spicy
fruity
and
quite
sweet
body
was
on
the
light
side
strongly
carbonated
finished
clean
fairly
boring
and
unimpressive
pours
a
light
golden
color
very
clear
i
was
expection
more
out
of
this
one
i
bought
it
along
with
fraoch
ebulum
and
kelpie
those
three
had
some
great
flavors
in
them
this
one
is
rather
bland
i
can
sense
just
a
touch
of
berry
in
there
other
than
that
its
just
a
little
sweetness
very
easy
to
drink
though
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
if
need
be
pours
out
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
bit
of
head
light
and
sweetish
tastes
of
berry
and
some
other
malts
nice
flavor
balance
this
is
a
very
good
brew
for
a
fruity
beer
worth
a
shot
certainly
i
could
see
how
this
could
be
a
favorite
brew
for
some
lucky
ba
cheers
crystal
clear

very
different
taste
was
very
oddly

im
not
sure
of
the
aroma
i
guess
its
the
gooseberry
thats
supposedly
included
however
wheat
aroma
taste
is
very
tart
wheat
overall
a
good
beer
this
ale
poured
hazy
golden
colour
with
a
thin
white

the
nose
is
really
subtle
maybe
some
corn
and
malt
but
not
much
else
there
is
some
sweetness
on
the
tongue
maybe
caramel
and
malt
as
well
as
a
bit
of
graininess
not
much
else
i
dont
really
even
get
the
heather
that
its
said
its
made
with
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
standard
light
lager
and
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
floral
o
2
75
nothing
to
make
this
one
stand
out
it
is
just
okay
at
best
i
had
some
hopes
for
it
to
be
a
winner
but
it
is
not
doing
it
for
me
the
nose
and
the
taste
are
just
slightly
different
than
bud
that
is
not
a
compliment
smells
and
tastes
not
far
from
light
perfumy
lager
disappointing
check
out

to
determine

i

oh
so

nice
to
try
a

not
bad
just
ok
looks
and
smells
decent
taste
isnt
offensive
but
not
much
to
it
certainly
something
to
give
a
nonbeer
drinker
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
it
does
not
have
a
lot
of
character
it
almost
taste
like
a
light
beer
enjoy
dark
straw
in
color
earthy
nose
grainy
and
mild
interesting
from
a
historical
perspective
but
thats
about
it
im
scottish
my
sisters
name
is
heather
for
the
heather
on
the
hill
i
really
wanted
to
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
did
not
i
love
that
they
tried
to
revive
this
style
but
i
did
not
care
for
it
gave
it
some
bonus
points
overall
for
uniqueness
a
hop
free
beer
a
wonderful
beer
very
subtle
at
the
first
sip
your
tongue
will
most
likely
be
confused
dont
worry
this
is
quite
normal
this
is
most
likely
your
first
time
drinking
a
hop
free
beer
the
heather
flavor
is
heavenly
and
sublime
if
you
dont
know
what
heather
is
look
it
up
and
the
fog
often
mentioned
in
literature
is
still
presenta
sudden
sleepiness
caused
by
certain
fungi
that
grow
on
wild
heather
if
drank
with
food
stick
to
something
mild
that
will
not
overpower
the
floral
goodness
of
this
brew
appearance
is
not
far
off
from
a
hefeweizen
pale
golden
color
hazy
white
head
things
differ
thereafter
clean
nose
light
citrus
light
malt
flavor
with
delicate
hops
clean
light
drinkable
some
light
floral
qualities
noted
beer
is
easily
overpowered
with
foods
this
was
good
and
interesting
ill
search
for
a
fresher
bottle
next
time
overall
this
is
really
good
gruit
id
drink
it
again
without
hesitation
overall
it
was
ok
i
think
i
need
to
give
it
another
try
and
see
if
i
missed
out
on
this
tastes
of
honey
and
florals
heather
slightly
bitter
finish
wheaty
feels
like
brett
hops
yellow
with
a
good
foamy
white
head
sweet
caramel
but
a
strong
rye
feel
underneath
quite
refreshing
a
hint
of
lemon
nice
to
get
a
decent
unhopped
beer
with
a
prereinheitsgebot
recipe
hops
increases
the
production
of
estrogen
in
the
body
and
the
church
wanted
to
feminize
people
to
make
them
more
compliant
especially
as
the
inquisition
was
winding
down
hence
they
forced
the
use
of
hops
upon
brewers
first
in
germany
then
everywhere
first
in
this
style
for
me
so
going
on
description
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
small
white
foamy
head
smells
kind
of
yeasty
with
some
citrus
lemon
maybe
and
a
sweetness
i
cant
pinpoint
taste
is
sweet
and
unique
like
paw
paw
fruit
zesty
citrus
honey
flowery
or
herb
like
but
not
hops
and
a
solid
malt
base
above
average
carbonation
gives
it
a
little
bit
of
a
crisp
bite
like
champagne
slightly
slicksticky
aftertastefinish
otherwise
medium
bodied
not
a
favorite
by
any
means
but
pretty
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
i
would
recommend
trying
just
because
it
is
very
different
very
enjoyable
for
a
beer
with
no
hops
kudos
to
the
brewery
for
recreating
an
ancientstyle
ale
that
you
hardly
ever
hear
of
overall
an
interesting
brew
if
a
little
confusing
it
has
a
long
history
being
the
oldest
beer
style
still
brewed
in
europe
dates
to
2000b
c
flavour
difficult
to
pin
down
and
may
be
very
hard
to
review
for
some
it
is
probably
not
the
best
gruit
i
have
had
but
it
is
still
more
than
drinkable
and
i
would
not
steer
others
away
from
it
even
if
i
personally
would
not
rush
out
to
buy
another
enjoyed
a
bottle
while
in
scotland
different
but
good
very
puzzled
indeed
o
a
nice
easy
drinker
that
has
an
underlying
heather
nose
and
flavor
again
no
real
hop
presence
anywhere
so
its
a
little
different
in
that
regard
recommended
for
a
nice
change
of
pace
the
history
behind
this
ale
is
fascinating
the
bottle
tells
the
story
of
the
oldest
scottish
ale
dating
back
to
2000
b
c
at
the
initial
sip
it
is
sweet
with
distinct
floral
overtones
a
slight
twist
of
hops
then
appears
followed
by
light
earthy
malts
giving
the
beer
its
character
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
nutty
and
is
strangely
chalk
like
very
good
overall
a
testament
to
the
4000
years
its
been
brewed
id
definitely
go
another
i
dont
know
what
heather
smells
or
tastes
like
not
having
been
in
scotland
in
at
least
a
decade
so
i
dont
know
whether
the
herbiness
is
the
typical
heather
aromaflavor
or
not
i
do
know
that
this
is
an
interesting
if
somewhat
innocuous
beer
i
would
like
to
find
this
on
tap
sometime
a
really
really
great
viking
style
pale
the
williams
bros
are
known
for
their
super
light
mouthfeel
and
herbal
flavors
out
of
the
whole
lineup
the
fraoch
heather
is
my
favorite
the
pour
is
a
clear
amber
but
the
lack
of
head
or
lacing
was
originally
concerning
smells
of
sweet
grasses
and
light
florals
the
taste
is
spot
on
crisp
and
clean
heather
comes
in
for
a
quick
kiss
of
herbs
sweet
malt
and
an
earthy
essence
she
finishes
quickly
and
leaves
you
refreshed
but
wanting
more
thirst
quenching
tasty
easy
to
drink
definitely
will
drink
again
food
match
roasted
pig
on
a
spit
with
a
honeyglaze
roast
carrots
potatoes
and
fennel
your
typical
medieval
fare
for
an
ancient
ale
the
taste
has
a
thin
grainy
character
but
the
herbal
spices
really
define
this
beer
i
will
have
to
assume
that
the
unusual
flowery
flavor
comes
from
the
heather
flower
which
i
am
not
entirely
familiar
with
this
most
definitely
has
a
unique
quality
to
it
o
similar
to
the
gooseberry
wheat
ale
by
the
same
company
in
texture
and
somewhat
in
flavour
but
more
gentle
and
relaxed
not
as
intense
would
go
well
with
haggis
i
reckon
love
the
history
good
flavour
but
not
really
grabbing
me
unless
i
can
find
out
more
about
this
unique
brew
had
this
after
a
weekend
camping
trip
to
the
isle
of
eigg
in
mallaig
really
cool
label
and
a
style
of
scottish
beer
that
has
been
around
for
thousands
of
years
great
beer
with
floral
notes
earthy
feel
on
the
palate
surprisingly
smooth
with
a
good
finish
hoping
i
can
find
this
when
i
return
to
the
u
s
similar
appearance
aroma
and
taste
to
a
well
crafted
lager
well
balanced
and
subtle
o
good
drinkability
a
bit
too
sweet
but
a
classic
old
ale
my
first
gruit
ale
really
recommended
havent
had
much
heather
in
my
culinary
ventures
so
its
new
ground
for
me
very
drinkable
summer
brew
im
not
a
huge
lemon
fan
but
it
plays
well
here
o
much
better
than
the
grozet
imo
still
lacking
some
oompf
but
the
sharp
taste
at
the
start
really
sells
it
for
me
would
drink
again
overall
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
one
i
wouldnt
rush
out
to
repurchase
didnt
enjoy
this
nearly
as
much
as
the
elderberry
one
still
nice
use
of
herbs
here
just
wish
it
shone
through
more
overall

i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
buying
a
beer
that
claimed
to
be
made
of
flowers
but
this
brew
did
not
disappoint
certainly
not
so
different
that
it
would
lead
your
average
lover
of
hops
and
barley
would
turn
up
hisher
nose
nonetheless
this
beer
is
unusual
however
it
retains
enough
elements
present
in
modern
beers
to
stand
as
a
beer
that
is
supposedly
similar
to
what
the
scots
drank
in
2000
bce
but
is
still
readily
accessible
to
modern
beer
drinkers
recommended
for
the
historical
elements
alone
but
this
beer
certainly
is
worth
trying
just
to
drink
a
great
beer
impressively
balanced
for
such
subdued
herbal
additions
a
big
departure
from
yeast
malt
or
hop
forward
flavors
it
is
something
that
is
quietly
impressive
for
balance
and
uniqueness
i
unfortunately
probably
judge
too
harshly
because
this
isnt
a
style
i
drink
often
o
this
ale
is
highly
drinkable
and
very
unique
its
also
quite
cool
to
think
that
you
are
partaking
in
an
ale
that
was
first
brewed
in
2000bc
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
balance
this
beer
provides
and
the
honey
tealike
notes
the
heather
while
not
prevalent
is
noticeable
and
provides
that
little
bit
of
something
extra
a
very
good
beer
o
a
fine
quaff
with
no
wow
factor
i
could
easily
drink
this
again
if
not
very
often
good
to
break
up
the
monotony
of
mediocre
brown
ales
and
ipas
though
its
like
a
summer
ale
sessionable
drinkable
and
refreshing
fraoch
is
gaelic
for
heather
this
ale
doesnt
seem
that
ancient
very
civilized
o
interesting
strange
floral
im
not
quite
sold
on
it
but
im
glad
i
had
it
i
didnt
score
a
s
t
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
o
this
is
the
first
gruit
i
have
had
and
the
first
unhopped
beer
i
have
had
as
far
as
i
know
it
is
a
pleasant
experience
to
taste
something
like
this
in
regard
to
the
location
and
time
period
these
kinds
of
beer
were
made
but
on
the
other
hand
its
rather
plain
and
couldnt
find
myself
drinking
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
very
mild
flavor
a
perfect
drinking
and
matching
socks
all
day
kind
of
beer
lightly
carbonated
which
is
good
cause
i
dont
know
how
well
those
sea
monkeys
will
burp
up
no
smell
at
all
which
also
makes
it
good
for
drinking
and
matching
socks
all
day
cause
nothing
is
worse
than
socks
that
smell
like
spilt
beer
bottle
pours
a
dark
yellowgold
color
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
some
residual
lacing
aroma
is
floral
grassy
with
hints
of
grain
flavor
is
a
mix
of
floral
with
sweet
malt
and
clover
honey
light
bodied
and
very
dry
finish
that
borders
on
astringent
light
easydrinking
and
sessionable
but
not
something
i
would
probably
seek
out
excellent
scottish
gruit
pick
this
one
up
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
atmosphere
is
really
solid
nice
hue
not
much
of
head
but
light
but
distinct
lacing
nose
consists
of
many
subtle
notes
of
grass
hop
fruit
and
corn
syrup
flavor
is
a
very
light
malt
tone
accentuated
with
a
little
soda
and
fruit
and
finished
with
a
slight
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
taste
is
more
of
the
herbal
with
a
touch
of
fruit
in
the
mix
somehow
definitely
a
maltbased
ale
this
one
brings
a
floral
finish
enjoyable
and
different
from
the
usual
craft
ales
b
interesting
to
have
an
idea
through
this
example
on
how
beer
tasted
a
long
time
ago
before
the
use
of
hops
also
the
fact
that
it
tastes
a
bit
similar
to
juniper
beers
it
may
indicate
that
this
was
the
standard
of
how
beers
should
taste
like
back
then
semi
hazed
golden
color
with
a
bright
white
head
which
dies
quickly
very
tea
like
and
herbal
on
the
nose
tastes
almost
belgian
like
sweet
rose
water
notes
upfront
with
faint
bubble
gum
and
banana
medium
body
with
light
effervescence
herbal
and
tea
like
on
the
back
end
dismissed
finish
with
bright
flavors
lingering
pretty
nice
and
easy
drinking
rjt
o
explosive
craft
beer
growth
can
make
it
hard
to
find
something
new
and
really
unique
but
take
one
look
at
this
fantastic
label
within
is
an
ancient
beer
brewed
long
before
craft
beer
and
in
a
sea
of
crazy
options
fraoch
heather
ale
is
still
unique
and
outstanding
this
earthy
floral
and
herbal
beer
has
layers
of
complexity
and
ancestry
ingrained
in
it
for
an
outstanding
oneofakind
experience
overall
easy
drinking
and
herbal
the
herbalness
is
subtle
though
would
have
again
basically
this
is
a
weird
experience
and
an
awkward
flavor
i
would
order
this
again
if
i
was
eating
but
only
if
there
was
good
involved
i
have
a
feeling
this
doesnt
get
better
as
it
heats
up
either
just
has
a
certain
flavor
that
i
would
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
that
gets
gross
as
it
gets
warm
glad
this
was
on
the
list
but
i
am
not
blown
away
has
anyone
tried
this
with
food
oh
and
the
burp
is
horrible
it
tastes
like
sour
grapes
overall
flavours
were
okay
but
it
was
too
sweet
for
me
interesting
for
sure
it
pours
with
very
little
head
and
i
got
no
lacing
the
body
is
clear
but
looks
thick
golden
honey
it
has
the
aroma
of
honey
oranges
and
multigrain
bread
it
has
the
taste
of
wild
flowers
and
honey
its
flatness
makes
it
seem
like
a
tea
of
anonymous
mixed
herbs
there
is
no
alcoholic
taste
it
ends
dry
with
a
flowergrass
aftertaste
the
most
striking
aspect
of
this
beer
is
its
balance
nothing
overwhelming
combines
to
make
a
really
good
beer
overall
very
glad
to
have
had
this
on
tap
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
beer
to
have
it
again
a
new
favorite
overall
i
would
have
this
fine
brew
again
very
brilliant
overall
how
do
i
put
it
this
stuff
while
apparently
seemingly
a
novelty
is
quite
flavorful
and
considered
as
a
full
fledged
participant
inthe
world
of
beer
which
is
quite
rare
for
the
novelty
category
it
is
a
decent
brew
and
for
whatever
reason
behind
its
conception
as
the
review
notes
state
its
a
very
drinkable
brew
which
would
convince
me
of
believing
i
am
being
healed
of
whatever
ailment
that
is
bothering
me
of
course
i
prefer
higher
strength
elixirs
but
i
can
understand
the
primitive
ways
of
mankind
o
a
tasty
brew
some
unique
flavours
and
easily
drinkable
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
its
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
final
grade

an
a
fraoch
heather
ale
might
just
be
the
first
spiced
beer
ive
ever
had
that
i
would
consider
truly
sessionable
the
unique
flavour
offers
up
enough
spicy
herbal
notes
to
keep
things
interesting
but
never
comes
close
to
overwhelming
or
exhausting
the
palate
even
i
suspect
after
more
than
one
bottle
of
the
four
ales
in
this
brewerys
sampler
this
is
easily
the
most
drinkable
potentially
the
most
wellintegrated
and
probably
my
favourite
well
worth
a
try
and
id
definitely
recommend
the
sampler
historic
ales
from
scotland
to
any
newbie
who
wishes
to
find
out
what
this
relatively
obscure
style
is
all
about
o
very
strange
and
interesting
beer
strange
cuz
ive
never
had
heather
before
but
this
in
a
good
way
it
took
a
little
to
grow
on
me
but
this
a
good
session
food
pairing
beer
i
was
left
feeling
a
little
underwhelmed
by
this
not
having
much
if
any
experience
with
the
flavors
of
heather
and
sweet
gale
makes
this
hard
to
judge
however
the
bottle
could
have
been
old
and
this
an
ale
much
better
consumed
as
fresh
as
possible
the
herbal
flavors
were
a
little
too
subtle
but
at
the
same
time
you
wouldnt
want
them
to
be
over
the
top
considering
the
alcohol
level
and
seeming
simplicity
of
the
malt
bill
ill
definitely
give
this
another
shot
if
i
can
get
a
younger
bottle
on
tap
at
the
new
course
clubhouse
st
andrews
has
a
compact
white
head
lacing
is
alright
but
could
be
better
limited
carbonation
colour
is
a
medium
straw
gold
smell
is
quite
pleasant
balanced
maltiness
with
a
nice
heather
earthiness
but
not
remarkable
taste
has
a
nice
malt
aspect
heather
and
herbal
character
is
prominant
but
tempered
nicely
a
elegant
mint
character
finish
is
smooth
lightly
bitter
makes
for
a
very
pleasant
sessionable
ale
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
creaminess
carbonation
is
mild
id
recommend
this
an
interesting
take
and
very
well
done
drinks
well
interesting
and
balanced
ogreat
beer
i
had
never
heard
of
the
style
and
just
picked
it
up
glad
i
did
looking
forward
to
finding
more
beers
in
the
style
the
most
surprising
part
of
this
beer
is
how
well
heather
works
as
a
bittering
agent
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
trippel
with
a
similar
level
of
carbonation
and
slightly
spicy
mouthfeel
but
it
ends
with
a
surprising
tartness
more
akin
to
a
saison
i
made
the
mistake
of
letting
it
chill
for
too
long
but
once
it
warmed
some
it
was
quite
good
and
well
worth
the
wait
for
the
warming
a
very
pleasant
change
from
traditional
hopsbased
beers
would
make
overall
im
quite
surprised
by
this
beer
its
not
your
regular
ale
and
definitely
has
a
unique
flavor
combo
going
on
i
love
the
creamy
like
round
feeling
of
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
its
very
fluid
and
refreshing
yet
with
a
dry
finish
and
leaves
you
with
a
aftertaste
that
wants

poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute
glass
pours
a
light
orange
amber
with
a
slight
head
and
a
hint
of
lacing
aroma
of
wheat
with
a
slight
adjunct
component
flavor
is
light
wheat
with
some
floral
elements
light
citrus
and
light
malt
the
heather
element
redeems
this
ale
which
otherwise
would
be
pretty
uninspiring
it
would
be
nice
to
try
a
more
intense
attempt
at
this
style
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
would
not
revisit
in
this
form
breezy
expertly
blended
to
get
away
with
the
spritely
carbonation
and
interesting
brew
i
can
imagine
ancient
scots
downing
a
lot
of
these
tasty
but
not
overpowering
drink
its
a
nice
beer
very
new
very
unique
but
something
people
should
try
i
would
like
to
drink
again
sits
well
on
a
hot
day
overall
nice
brew
but
there
is
something
missing
depth
strength
easy
to
drink
and
i
really
like
the
heather
element
good
brew
but
not
great
brew
overall
quite
an
odd
brew
which
is
expected
from
the
same
guys
that
bring
you
kelpie
seaweed
beer
worth
a
try
to
have
more
scottish
beers
under
your
belt
o
tasty
enjoyable
to
sit
and
sip
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
not
complex
but
good
tasting
m
light
to
medium

with

4
0
d
good
beer
that
works
the
heather
in
seemlessly
solid
all
around
o
a
very
interesting
style
and
much
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
both
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
really
surprised
me
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
as
thick
and
full
bodied
as
it
was
and
i
was
expecting
a
much
more
intense
earthiness
from
the
heather
i
would
actually
buy
this
again
not
necessarily
to
drink
for
myself
but
definitely
to
bring
to
a
tasting
or
as
a
gift
i
could
see
this
beer
being
a
big
hit
at
weddings
or
spring
themed
parties
very
unique
and
worth
a
try
overall
im
a
sucker
for
the
taste
of
gruit
so
this
review
is
biased
pretty
heavily
id
drink
this
instead
of
an
american
pale
ale
any
day
its
light
and
refreshing
its
got
that
wonderful
gruit
taste
and
great
welcoming
bitter
why
dont
more
people
make
this
style
of
beer
poured
into
a
snifter
the
bottle
was
shared
to
gain
varying
options
the
color
was
a
measured
pale
golden
color
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
to
bubble
a
strong
honey
aroma
attracts
attention
of
the
senses
noting
a
sense
of
sweetness
upon
the
initial
taste
a
sweet
and
smooth
taste
was
noted
with
a
honey
taste
and
aroma
present
it
brought
to
mind
a
honey
mead
the
backbone
of
the
beer
was
the
flowery
heather
notes
with
a
slight
wheat
sweetness
in
truth
there
were
few
characteristics
of
beer
present
on
the
other
hand
i
enjoyed
the
texture
and
was
surprised
by
the
taste
i
am
not
certain
it
would
be
something
i
would
drink
in
the
future
it
is
still
recorded
as
a
positive
experience
o
very
interesting
beer
very
happy
i
got
to
try
this
unique
and
ancient
style
hopefully
more
to
come
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
is
different
from
what
youd
expect
by
the
presence
of
the
heather

bottom
line
try
it
its
worth

look
this
was
my

encounter
with
this
style
very
intriguing
if
youre
in
the
mood
fraoch
heather
ale
pours
a
light
sherrycolored
brown
with
a
onefingered
head
that
lingers
like
an
unwanted
guest
the
smell
is
malty
and
relatively
straight
forward
i
get
little
else
maybe
just
a
hint
of
very
faint
herbs
fraoch
tastes
dry
herby
and
winelike
and
i
get
grapes
and
floral
notes
on
the
finish
im
no
expert
on
this
style
but
fraoch
is
very
subtle
not
in
your
face
at
all
its
clearly
different
decently
drinkable
and
a
change
up
from
your
every
day
beer
cheers
overall
this
is
really
good
very
mild
and
refreshing
has
a
tea
like
flavor
and
feel
thats
really
nice
it
really
reminds
me
of
a
mead
and
a
saision
with
a
little
green
tea
spice
note
this
was
tasty
and
man
what
a
great
light
easy
to
drink
summer
beer
give
this
a
try
for
sure
i
would
not
rate
this
higher
than
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
but
it
is
definitely
worth
drinking
again
overall
this
is
unique
complex
and
still
goes
down
easy
overy
interesting
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
but
a
different
experience
thanks
for
sharing
mikey
sorry
about
the
hops
issue
notes
its
tasty
and
very
drinkable
cheers
poured
a

offwhite
head
the
body
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
and
it
exhausts
all
the
effervescence
into
that
small
head
id
expect
some
sort
of
heather
smell
but
really
im
getting
very
little
smell
off
it
just
a
faintest
herbal
essence
the
taste
is
also
very
mild
both
a
little
sweet
and
a
little
sour
faintly
herbal
maybe
even
a
little
cynar
the
body
is
light
sweetness
persists
in
the
finish
i
expected
more
heather
in
the
heather
ale
o
i
expected
a
peculiarunique
beer
but
i
actually
found
a
nice
simple
very
refreshing
pale
ale
that
was
just
a
bit
more
on
the
herbal
side
than
usual
overall
a
pleasant
beer
good
stuff
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
not
enough
to
sustain
my
interest
for
once
the
description
on
the
label
of
this
beers
sensory
properties
seem
on
target
it
has
a
distinctive
floral
aroma
and
a
dry
winelike
finish
malt
is
clearly
evident
in
both
aroma
and
taste
but
not
quite
as
rich
or
pronounced
as
the
full
malt
character
on
the
label
might
lead
one
to
expect
floral
throughout
including
the
aftertaste
this
beer
leans
towards
sweet
which
seems
in
keeping
with
the
floral
flavor
profile
still
it
smells
sweeter
than
it
tastes
the
rather
light
and
dry
mouthfeel
also
work
integrate
nicely
to
produce
a
very
refined
and
distinctive
sensory
experience
from
an
ancient
ale
t
slightly
oaky
flavor
with
some
pale
malt
and
a
nice
herbal
sweetness
i
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
like
this
beer
very
much
but
it
was
actually
pretty
tasty
light
with
some
good
flavor
the
finish
is
clean
and
dry
just
a
whiff
of
alcohol
is
noticed
appears
a
pale
copper
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
forming
thick
fine
speckled
lacing
left
behind
on
the
sides
of
my
chalice
aroma
spicy
herbal
floral
notes
upfront
with
the
heather
additions
sweet
caramel
malt
base
with
minimal
to
no
hops
im
pretty
sure
most
of
their
brews
are
ancient
gruit
ales
also
in
the
nose
is
a
strong
honey
like
note
from
the
malt
profile
i
know
theres
no
actual
honey
but
im
getting
a
light
generic
fruitiness
with
a
strong
presence
of
rich
honey
flavor
is
spicy
with
a
long
dry
finish
upfront
light
fruit
a
touch
of
honey
and
caramel
malts
dance
around
with
floralspicy
heather
and
floral
additions
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
with
a
mellow
carbonation
level
actually
is
pretty
unremarkable
overall
a
beer
that
just
doesnt
excite
definitely
not
worth
it
for
a
ten
dollar
four
pack
thus
far
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
fairly
aggressive
pour
yielded
not
much
head
but
some
white
bubbles
and
a
thin
film
to
support
it
nose
has
some
caramelly
notes
berries
a
bit
of
toasty
malts
and
a
touch
of
an
herbalfloral
note
a
touch
of
a
grain
taste
has
more
of
the
berry
and
sweet
bready
notes
dry
toasty
malts
honey
and
again
a
hint
of
something
herbal
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
mediumlight
but
theres
some
decent
texture
carbonation
is
quite
low
quite
nice
simple
and
relatively
flavourful
if
tame
my
first
experience
with
heather
and
i
think
i
have
a
sense
of
what
it
contributed
to
this
but
its
certainly
something
id
be
open
to
in
beers
in
the
future
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
that
i
found
remarkable
the
characteristics
arent
pronounced
enough
to
distinguish
it
from
various
other
amber
ales
on
the
market
its
worth
trying
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
i
cant
comment
on
the
appearance
as
i
drank
it
right
from
the
bottle
it
had
an
interesting
scent
reminding
me
of
spices
and
flowers
the
taste
was
malty
with
flavors
such
as
honey
and
spices
showing
up
it
had
a
crisp
mouthfeel
i
can
say
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
one
id
like
to
have
some
other
time
outstanding
in
the
bottle
and
i
dream
to
drink
it
on
tap
in
scotland
one
day
what
a
finish
the
ancient
recipe
with
the
heather
gives
a
bit
of
an
aroma
but
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
and
after
taste
not
highly
carbonated
and
not
too
sure
on
the
appearance
mostly
drank
from
the
bottle
but
poured
it
in
a
glass
and
it
was
a
bit
dark
and
cloudy
the
taste
was
so
apealing
that
the
appearance
was
actually
irrelivant
overall
this
beer
is
real
satisfying
unique
tasting
and
real
easy
to
drink
really
enjoy
this
style
this
particular
one
really
reminds
me
of
some
type
of
mellow
herbal
braggot
nice
definitely
worth
a
try
although
i
did
not
enjoy
it
as
much
as
the
alba
o
not
real
impressed
seeing
it
in
a
glass
it
offers
nothing
special
to
set
it
apart
from
a
glass
of
beer
at
a
local
dive
bar
nose
and
taste
are
so
faint
that
once
again
it
offers
nothing
that
makes
me
want
to
buy
this
again
its
a
good
beer
to
introduce
people
to
other
options
with
no
hops
bitterness
but
thats
about
it
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
overall
ill
definitely
buy
this
one
again
full
bodied
and
smooth
this
is
a
very
pleasant
and
bright
ale
that
would
be
great
in
the
spring
or
summer
its
very
easygoing
but
also
rich
with
flavour
d
a
more
flavourful
and
unusual
gruit
thats
still
accessible
fairly
easydrinking
and
complex
enough
to
be
worth
sipping
to
boot
try
it
at
least
once
just
to
broaden
your
definition
of
beer
sweet
light
toffee
malts
up
front
set
the
tone
smack
into
a
floral
bed
of
that
heather
stuff
must
be
eh
i
dont
know
never
tasted
a
heather
flower
but
that
must
be
what
it
is
little
to
no
hop
presence
body
is
light
refreshing
and
overall
is
a
solid
scottish
ale
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
medium
carbonation
descent
brew
first
taste
of
the
style
so
nothing
to
compare
against
not
a
lot
of
flavor
yet
has
a
crisp
refreshing
quality
and
no
repulsive
flavors
if
i
were
alive
4000
years
ago
i
would
drink
this
o
enjoyable
very
unique
ancient
scottish
brew
glad
i
tried
it
but
wouldnt
grab
it
again
moreys
bottom
line
im
glad
that
i
got
to
try
all
4
of
these
scottish
ales
but
aside
from
elderberry
black
ale
theyre
just
a
bit
too
watery
for
my
taste
makes
me
wish
that
i
would
have
got
them
in
the
summer
months
its
unique
but
i
was
expecting
a
fuller
and
more
flavorful
ale
m
very
light
and
drinkable
went
down
rather
quickly
this
beer
was
okay
it
was
nice
to
try
something
new
for
a
change
overall
i
have
never
tasted
a
beer
like
this
one
but
i
am
happy
i
tried
it
dont
think
i
will
pick
up
any
more
myself
though
it
probably
is
a
brew
better
paired
or
just
not
my
favorite
o
a
good
beer
to
try
if
you
want
something
different
an
excellent
beer
if
youre
transitioning
from
wine
i
will
try
and
pair
it
with
cheese
and
bread
next
time
o
i
thought
this
beer
would
be
spicier
im
not
disappointed
though
because
it
has
a
lot
going
on
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
it
feels
like
theyve
used
the
heather
to
replace
the
most
of
the
hops
this
beats
a
budweiser
drink
more
heather
ale
overall
this
was
a
very
unique
brew
its
enjoyable
to
drink
on
its
own
but
the
history
and
novelty
surrounding
the
brew
add
a
great
deal
to
the
experience
very
interesting
much
better
than
expected
light
to
medium
bodied
with
great
carbonation
this
beer
has
great
drinkability
the
body
is
a
little
light
which
prevents
it
from
being
thick
or
sticky
but
also
seems
to
downplay
the
flavors
a
bit
the
carbonation
is
a
good
bit
fizzy
and
while
it
helps
the
beers
drinkability
it
also
seems
to
hinder
the
flavors
a
bit
a
little
less
carbonation
and
a
little
more
body
would
help
to
make
the
flavors
in
this
beer
more
recognizable
and
explorable
a
light
not
hard
to
drinkbrew
but
not
really
that
exciting
either
d
very
approachable
while
still
very
interesting
there
are
unique
flavors
that
arent
present
in
american
brews
that
are
quite
balanced
and
refreshing
overall
boring
boring
boring
is
the
best
way
to
sum
this
up
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
orange
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
patterns
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
subdued
overall
there
is
a
slight
malt
aroma
but
i
am
not
getting
much
else
from
this
one
taste
is
of
malt
and
some
herbal
flavors
i
assume
that
is
possibly
from
the
heather
used
in
the
beer
but
its
really
not
a
floral
taste
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
flat
and
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
i
have
had
some
other
beers
of
this
style
that
are
much
better
overall
and
with
more
of
the
traditional
flavors
i
have
read
about
d
its
easy
drinking
especially
on
a
hot
summers
day
overall
first
scottish
gruit
and
i
must
say
im
impressed
its
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
that
said
go
grab
one
and
see
for
yourself
dvery
easy
to
drink
but
not
among
the
more
complex
beers
ive
had
id
like
to
give
this
style
another
shot
the
fifth
entry
in
swillfest
2011
it
pours
a
clear
light
russetamber
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
dark
greens
light
cocoa
brown
sugar
and
plenty
of
wet
grass
the
herbalness
is
strong
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
chlorophyll
content
is
significantly
diminished
thankfully
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
creamy
feel
overall
not
that
bad
really
i
remember
having
this
years
ago
and
nearly
retching
with
every
sip
but
such
a
reaction
was
nowhere
to
be
found
here
makes
me
wonder
what
its
doing
here
as
part
of
swillfest
this
beer
looks
a
lighter
orange
color
the
smell
has
a
sweet
honey
aroma
the
aromatics
still
have
that
highly
herbal
smell
the
taste
is
heather
and
i
really
dont
like
it
to
be
fair
in
comparison
to
the
last
time
that
i
remember
consuming
this
beer
this
seemingly
has
improved
i
still
dont
like
drinking
this
but
its
perhaps
the
best
part
of
this
so
called
swillfest
o
my
first
gruit
and
a
nice
one
at
that
if
i
could
find
this
more
easily
i
may
pick
it
up
again
nice
summer
beer
it
depends
because
even
though
i
enjoyed
it
nothing
too
amazing
cheers
i
went
in
thinking
this
was
just
a
gimmick
beer
but
came
away
impressed
it
has
some
very
nice
flavors
and
is
easy
drinking
definitely
worthy
of
picking
up
again
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
subtle
it
has
a
nice
drysweet
balance
and
seems
to
achieve
a
flavor
that
is
unique
to
itself
fraoch
heather
ale
pours
a
light
sherrycolored
brown
with
a
onefingered
head
that
lingers
like
an
unwanted
guest
the
smell
is
malty
and
relatively
straight
forward
i
get
little
else
maybe
just
a
hint
of
very
faint
herbs
fraoch
tastes
dry
herby
and
winelike
and
i
get
grapes
and
floral
notes
on
the
finish
im
no
expert
on
this
style
but
fraoch
is
very
subtle
not
in
your
face
at
all
its
clearly
different
decently
drinkable
and
a
change
up
from
your
every
day
beer
o
pretty
tasty
my
first
runin
with
a
gruit
od
cool
and
different
very
floral
and
refreshing
tasty
stuff
and
probably
a
good
example
of
old
school
beer
styles
a
scottish
gruit
my
first
pours
a
golden
cloudy
color
with
a
a
thinner
head
that
dissipates
rather
rapidly
smells
of
grass
malts
and
a
meadow
unusual
tastes
of
flowers
honey
and
light
malt
very
unusual
taste
like
an
experimental
ale
with
orange
blossom
honey
light
body
sessionable
mouthfeel
unusual
not
so
good
glad
i
tried
it
but
would
really
like
to
try
it
fresh
off
the
tap
at
the
brewery
as
it
seemed
to
be
lacking
a
zippy
freshnesstrue
taste
cool
bottle
poured
hazy
orangebrown
with
a
nice
white
head
that
retained
pretty
well
floral
nose
with
some
malts
and
earth
coming
through
nice
herbal
taste
with
crisp
floral
highlights
and
a
bit
of
citrus
and
earthiness
coming
through
finishes
pretty
dry
with
a
bit
of
a
stale
aftertaste
but
overall
crisp
and
drinkable
cheers
dry
smooth
and
light
bodied
i
like
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
it
is
well
made
and
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
was
surprised
at
how
nicely
the
heather
counterbalanced
the
sweet
malts
the
picts
knew
what
they
were
doing
pours
a
crisp
golden
blonde
with
about
a
finger
of
head
and
mild
lacing
has
a
unique
subtle
aroma
of
flora
combined
with
honey
and
malt
creamy
flavor
similar
to
a
belgian
tripel
with
moderate
body
silky
and
mellow
through
the
swallow
with
a
light
hint
of
bitterness
and
carbonation
during
the
aftertaste
overall
a
tasty
brew
simple
but
rich
in
its
own
way
d
this
is
just
an
ok
beer
very
drinkable
but
not
a
bunch
of
flavor
or
taste
that
makes
you
want
to
get
another
one
not
a
bad
beer
just
an
bland
beer
pours
a
copper
orange
color
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
sweet
flowery
aroma
with
spices
fruity
herbal
flavor
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
mediumlight
body
with
a
lingering
sweet
finish
i
can
only
drink
so
much
of
this
but
its
a
very
interesting
and
different
beer
the
heather
ale
is
very
interesting
its
light
in
color
pouring
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
soapy
white
head
the
beer
is
very
smooth
on
mouthfeel
and
light
the
flavors
are
herbal
and
very
floral
the
heather
gives
the
beer
a
bit
of
a
spice
thats
pretty
interesting
a
different
from
most
ales
out
there
i
love
the
historical
quality
of
this
beer
very
cool
stuff
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
dense
white
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
flowers
and
heather
a
very
nice
inviting
perfume
like
aroma
the
taste
has
a
very
nice
floral
taste
along
with
a
very
good
sweetness
to
it
very
light
very
inviting
the
mouthfeel
is
moderatley
carbonated
overall
everything
about
the
beer
is
inviting
the
smell
and
the
taste
also
a
very
easy
drink
could
easily
be
your
session
beer
not
overly
complex
but
just
very
good
if
this
beer
was
more
readily
available
it
would
be
a
great
session
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
regularly
easily
drinkable
and
refreshing
with
nice
herbal
flavour
not
terrible
but
the
fact
that
it
isnt
as
bad
as
the
last
two
makes
it
drinkable
d
this
is
a
very
poorly
executed
beer
only
saving
grace
is
in
the
taste
but
unfortunately
all
other
aspects
lack
severely
a
good
ale
with
some
interesting
flavours
its
surprisingly
muted
anyone
expecting
an
in
your
face
experience
will
be
disappointed
a
worthy
resurrection
of
an
ancient
style
and
well
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
d
very
drinkable
either
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
overall
a
good
beer
different
but
not
different
enough
to
be
weird
if
someone
had
handed
this
to
me
and
had
not
said
it
was
heather
i
would
have
never
known
add
tag
i
dont
have
a
lot
to
compare
this
too
as
im
no
expert
on
gruits
or
heather
ales
but
it
does
taste
similar
to
other
gruits
ive
had
the
heather
is
pronounced
and
the
flavoraroma
are
quite
pleasant
this
would
take
some
getting
used
to
but
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
beer
d
definitely
very
drinkable
if
you
dont
mind
tons
of
interesting
flavors
and
a
low
abv
you
can
session
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
golden
honey
in
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
to
lace
the
glass
the
aromas
are
of
grass
cloves
honey
and
light
malts
it
kind
of
resembles
a
solid
pilsner
the
flavors
consist
of
cloves
honey
a
spice
i
cant
quite
name
and
light
malty
sweetness
its
pretty
tasty
i
cant
get
the
honey
out
of
my
head
it
tastes
like
a
pilsner
with
honey
and
a
light
spice
it
drinks
in
between
light
and
medium
in
body
its
exceptionally
drinkable
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
and
from
the
reviews
it
appears
that
this
is
a
fine
representation
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
id
definitely
have
it
again
now
i
may
have
to
try
the
other
scottish
gruits
that
wbco
have
to
offer
fraoch
heather
ale
has
an
orange
colour
and
poured
with
a
4
mm
head
that
fades
to
nice
lacing
within
a
minute
or
so
this
beer
smells
like
grass
to
me
weird
the
flavour
is
green
and
grassy
up
front
with
hints
of
grain
the
aftertaste
is
nice
and
malty
its
a
bit
too
grassy
for
my
tastes
the
texture
is
foamy
and
thick
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
it
is
decent
but
not
one
of
my
favourites
very
easily
drinkable
the
floral
notes
are
not
strong
enough
to
reduce
drinkability
wouldnt
want
to
have
this
every
day
but
a
nice
ale
with
an
interesting
story
behind
it
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
beer
is
smooth
just
makes
one
feel
good
and
be
happy
a
perfect
session
beer
a
bit
dry
and
medium
bodied
very
pleasant
to
drink
and
i
easily
could
have
another
right
away
allaround
a
solid
beer
a
moderate
mouthfeel
light
carbonation
mild
but
complex
all
in
all
a
unique
but
very
pleasant
drink
much
better
when
fresh
im
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
definitely
worth
trying
d
this
is
an
easy
drinker
much
better
than
i
expected
a
disappointing
beer
this
smooth
wellcarbonated
ale
caresses
the
tongue
with
a
slightly
sweet
grain
flavor
offset
by
a
smattering
of
hops
and
an
intriguing
hint
of
citrus
and
flowers
well
crafted
this
ancient
recipe
is
definitely
worth
keeping
around
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
goes
down
very
quickly
scent
is
very
florally
and
fruity
i
also
get
some
wheat
there
are
mainly
pears
and
apples
in
the
nose
with
a
somewhat
grainy
aroma
as
well
taste
is
initially
a
bit
lemony
with
some
strong
floral
flavors
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
funk
which
i
wasnt
expecting
and
adds
to
great
flavor
taste
doesnt
carry
through
with
the
wheat
aromas
which
im
happy
about
there
are
some
bready
flavors
with
pear
and
green
apples
as
well
taste
is
very
wellbalanced
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
with
a
nice
dry
finish
this
is
quite
a
refreshing
beer
drinkability
is
high
i
think
this
one
is
a
bit
underrated
d
this
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
the
fact
that
you
dont
want
that
funky
aftertaste
to
be
what
youre
tasting
you
have
to
keep
drinking
it
give
them
a
try
you
will
be
surprised
i
could
easily
have
more
than
a
few
of
these
i
think
my
chardonnayloving
wife
may
enjoy
this
beer
highly
drinkable
nice
flavours
but
theyre
not
so
intense
that
theyll
wear
you
out
after
one
bottle
could
easily
quaff
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
drink
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
a
little
floral
it
makes
me
think
of
a
dry
white
wine
in
a
way
its
not
a
very
over
powering
flavor
so
you
could
drink
these
all
night
if
you
wanted
while
i
enjoyed
it
having
experienced
it
once
would
be
enough
for
awhile
drink
a
very
different
beer
that
im
happy
i
tried
cant
say
id
seek
it
out
again
though
overall
an
odd
beer
but
kind
of
good
just
unique
i
really
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
much
of
this
d
not
readily
available
but
not
a
tremendous
price
and
a
pretty
solid
beer
if
i
saw
it
by
happen
chance
i
would
pick
it
up
again
drinkability
id
say
a
very
good
allaround
ale
although
i
dont
have
enough
experience
with
gruits
in
fact
this
is
my
first
so
i
cant
tell
if
this
one
is
true
to
the
style
but
its
a
goodtasting
and
complex
enough
beer
its
kind
of
like
a
nicely
brewed
light
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
fairly
well
done
and
a
bit
different
pale
amber
body
with
a
faint
white
head
aroma
has
some
strong
fruity
floral
notes
sweet
malt
comes
through
in
the
nose
as
well
flavor
follows
the
nose
earthy
floral
spice
compliments
a
malt
forward
flavor
profile
moderate
body
with
a
clean
slightly
fruity
finish
very
drinkable
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
its
a
very
drinkable
combination
not
particularly
robust
flavor
yet
still
a
satisfying
combination
the
5
abv
is
also
a
plus
not
a
lot
of
head
from
this
one
but
the
one
finger
that
there
was
stuck
around
for
awhile
broken
but
clinging
lace
color
is
a
hazy
9
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
nice
floral
smell
with
honey
malt
and
sour
dough
bread
good
flavor
of
clover
honey
spices
wheat
a
tinge
of
ginger
and
malt
not
overly
heavy
in
my
mouth
but
there
is
body
there
good
flavor
and
a
nice
feeling
as
it
warms
my
body
good
ale
would
have
another
drinkability
clean
tasting
crisp
beer
there
is
not
anything
more
to
it
so
no
point
in
going
looking
for
it
enjoyed
it
good
way
to
end
my
night
drinkability
is
very
good
ive
found
it
to
be
very
refreshing
even
on
this
cold
ohio
night
only
drawback
is
i
find
it
gets
a
bit
muddled
as
it
warms
up
so
im
thinking
this
is
one
thats
better
cold
regardless
this
is
definitely
one
ill
revisit
from
time
to
time
my
damn
tongue
was
burnt
on
some
soup
today
so
all
the
flavors
and
such
arent
really
coming
thru
on
my
palate
ill
need
to
review
this
again
at
some
other
point
to
give
it
more
of
a
fair
shake
d
i
was
expecting
something
really
out
there
like
one
of
dfhs
ancient
brews
but
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
it
is
light
bubbly
and
refreshing
but
not
overly
sweet
i
really
like
the
herbiness
but
wish
the
heather
flavors
were
more
prominent
this
style
would
be
great
for
an
outdoor
party
on
a
warm
day
and
i
enjoyed
the
history
lesson
behind
the
style
overall
a
solid
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
and
smooth
my
first
gruit
so
cant
say
how
it
compares
in
the
style
been
hard
for
a
nonhoppy
beer
to
get
my
attention
lately
but
this
one
did
highly
recommend
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
picked
up
on
my
dayton
trip
if
available
near
me
it
would
be
worth
a
few
a
year
especially
in
the
smaller
format
also
good
to
share
with
friends
oy
drinks
nicely
thanks
in
part
to
the
soft
and
subtle
flavors
going
on
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
nice
brew
500
ml

with
a
medium
short
lived
white
head
not
much

aroma
of
ripe
fruit
biscuit
malt
with
hints
of
honey
and
floral

medium
smooth
body
juicy

ripe
fruit
and
earthy

fill
the

finish
is
medium
and
sweet
good
beer
to
try
once
for
5
a
bottle
drinkability
glad
to
have
tried
it
i
would
drink
it
again
if
someone
else
was
buying
purchased
as
part
of
a
four
bottle
pack
from
the
brewery
pours
a
golden
orange
colour
with
thin
white
head
with
hints
of
lacing
smells
really
sweet
lots
of
herbs
i
cant
place
my
finger
on
the
smell
but
probably
heather
and
fruity
flavour
is
almost
like
a
mild
pilsner
combined
with
the
herbs
a
very
nice
beer
i
bought
this
pack
last
year
and
will
likely
buy
this
once
a
year
as
these
beers
are
interesting
conclusion
an
interesting
ale
that
is
worth
trying
and
one
that
i
would
drink
again
without
hesitation
a
widely
distributed
way
to
expose
the
palate
to
this
extremely
old
style
i
wish
it
were
just
a
bit
more
complex
however
another
excellent
brew
from
scotland
d
well
it
looks
and
smells
good
and
then
things
are
underwhelming
i
dont
think
ill
be
running
out
to
get
another
one
of
these
anytime
soon
very
different
ale
must
have
been
nice
to
live
back
then
despite
the
strange
aftertaste
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
for
me
and
nice
for
something
different
worth
searching
out
every
so
often
d
this
is
terrific
all
around
i
see
why
the
style
has
lasted
4000
years
d
i
wouldnt
drink
this
very
often
but
fraoch
is
absolutely
interesting
and
it
was
fun
while
it
lasted
pick
some
up
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
from
a
500
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
brooklyn
brewery
glass
i
have
had
two
other
offerings
by
the
williams
brothers
brewery
the
alba
scots
pine
ale
and
the
kelpie
seaweed
ale
fraoch
ranks
above
kelpie
but
i
have
to
give
alba
scots
the
top
ranking
out
of
these
three
fraoch
pours
a
light
yet
opaque
yellowish
color
the
head
is
impressive
and
lacing
runs
down
the
glass
as
i
sip
it
the
smell
is
absolutely
wonderful
bringing
to
mind
flowers
and
for
some
reason
the
smell
of
a
field
on
a
bright
summers
day
the
taste
is
fairly
bitter
with
the
heather
definitely
coming
through
especially
in
the
after
taste
it
definitely
has
a
very
sweet
feel
to
it
with
almost
a
wineesque
character
to
it
the
drinkability
is
really
the
beers
only
downfall
it
is
tasty
but
even
the
500
ml
was
a
tad
much
overall
its
definitely
worth
a
look
especially
for
the
novelty
factor
the
style
claims
to
date
from
2000
bc
but
the
taste
is
pleasantly
surprising
id
recommend
the
alba
scots
pine
ale
over
this
beer
but
fraoch
did
not
disappoint
taste
is

this

has

poured
a

into
a
guinness
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
almost
copper
about
a
half
inch
of
white
foamy
head
looks
soft
and
creamy
aroma
is
interesting
very
floral
and
spiceherblike
the
same
goes
for
the
flavor
lots
of
subdued
flowery
spicy
and
herblike
tones
almost
tastes
like
an
herbal
tea
maybe
some
chamomilelike
undertones
very
good
stuff
highly
drinkable
and
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
a
darn
good
ale
overall
id
buy
more
of
this
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
because
the
floral
tastes
are
not
very
overpowering
im
not
sure
if
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
because
of
its
mild
amount
of
sweetness
im
coming
to
realize
that
i
like
heather
in
my
beer
this
one
did
not
disappoint
although
i
think
penny
weiz
uses
heather
to
greater
effect
as
the
citrus
notes
are
a
better
complement
than
buttery
ringwood
d
defiantly
something
different
will
have
to
hunt
down
more
of
this
style
drinkability
very
smooth
however
the
flowery
taste
which
was
ok
at
first
began
to
make
me
sick
by
the
end
of
the
beer
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
pollen
maltiness
is
fully
predominant
with
no
hop
presence
detectable
but
since
thats
what
i
expected
so
much
the
better
interesting
my
first
gruet
tasting
the
body
and
mouthfeel
mostly
light
low
carbonation
overall
i
just
didnt
find
this
beer
enjoyable
at
all
it
was
interesting
to
try
something
like
this
but
the
flavor
of
the
heather
just
didnt
sit
well
on
my
tongue
or
in
my
stomach
an
interesting
and
refreshing
brew
id
pick
it
up
again
especially
since
the
price
tag
was
fair
3
99
for
a
pint
d
a
decent
brew
and
quite
different
perhaps
i
romanticize
the
historicalarcheological
aspects
of
the
beer
a
bit
but
i
love
the
idea
of
resurrecting
old
lost
recipes
i
drank
this
in
inverness
and
edinburgh
and
dundee
and
was
really
thrilled
to
find
it
on
the
shelf
locally
i
was
expecting
gimmickry
but
this
is
a
solid
drinkable
summer
ale
as
much
as
i
understand
the
meaty
chewiness
of
scotch
ale
to
make
it
through
a
long
north
atlantic
winter
fraoch
is
a
perfect
beer
to
compliment
a
warm
highland
evening
or
to
imagine
a
highland
evening
on
your
porch
this
is
an
interesting
experiment
and
a
neat
recreation
of
a
very
old
style
the
world
needs
more
gruits
great
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
the
flowers
are
still
around
but
lend
way
to
grains
very
herbaceous
very
winelike
as
well
there
is
a
soft
cereal
taste
which
i
cant
help
but
think
reminds
me
of
banana
nut
crunch
with
milk
co2
was
a
tad
low
the
beer
finishes
with
honey
and
canola
oil
d
low
abv
and
very
easy
to
drink
could
be
a
good
session
beer
nothing
to
crazy
but
very
good
d
an
interesting
change
of
pace
from
other
pale
ales
i
would
drink
this
again
as
this
was
a
pleasant
if
not
impressive
brew
my
only
complaint
about
this
beer
is
that
i
feel
the
heather
flowers
dominate
the
taste
somewhat
rather
than
the
hops
malt
yeast
or
water
used
its
still
very
good
and
i
would
buy
it
again
especially
at
this
price
point
slainte
d
a
somewhat
interesting
brew
that
goes
down
easily
i
probably
wont
pick
this
up
again
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
either
d
smooth
finish
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
pairs
well
with
spicy
or
aromatic
foods
i
would
drink
this
again
if
available
i
dont
really
have
much
to
compare
this
against
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
great
brew
unique
and
enjoyable
i
can
certainly
detect
a
uniquely
scottish
character
to
fraoch
although
it
will
likely
be
a
while
im
looking
forward
to
having
it
again
a
must
try
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
its
very
refreshing
i
dont
think
ill
have
this
again
but
it
was
well
worth
the
try
notes
a
nice
fairly
interesting
beer
like
the
rest
of
their
offerings
this
one
is
a
bit
more
tame
than
the
others
though
well
balanced
flavors
between
the
sweet
malt
and
herbalfloral
heather
and
other
similar
flavors
nice
beer
to
drink
but
i
dont
feel
like
i
need
to
search
it
out
again
although
i
would
get
it
if
i
found
it
for
a
good
price
overall
a
decent
drinkable
beer
the
nose
was
quite
enticing
on
this
one
and
the
rest
of
it
made
for
a
nice
drinking
experience
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
a
really
nice
beer
overall
i
genuinely
enjoyed
it
but
i
only
with
the
flavors
were
richer
d
being
a
style
i
have
never
had
before
and
knew
nothing
about
i
had
nothing
to
compare
it
to
but
it
took
awhile
to
finish
yet
im
glad
i
tried
it
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
big
thick
white
head
that
retains
well
and
laces
very
well
an
herbal
sweet
aroma
sweet
tart
floral
flavors
with
a
medicene
like
aftertaste
very
mild
carbonation
for
the
head
that
it
produces
a
very
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
d
this
would
be
a
great
summer
brew
a
quaffer
to
a
degree
however
the
floral
finish
might
turn
some
folks
off
after
awhile
for
me
this
one
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
and
something
i
would
drink
on
a
warm
spring
or
summer
day
overall
drinkability

interesting
and
different
but
truly
a
onetrickpony
this
showcases
the
heatherjuniper
flavors
and
aromas
at
the
cost
of
all
other
aspects
i
would
enjoy
some
more
malt
backbone
to
balance
it
out
drinkability
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
as
i
didnt
know
quite
what
to
expect
but
liked
what
i
found
the
beer
very
refreshing
and
drinks
very
easily
id
definitely
like
another
i
can
see
trying
this
one
again
as
an
occasional
special
treat
and
think
it
would
be
a
very
nice
beer
to
serve
at
a
party
decent
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
carbonation
but
not
excellent
to
be
honest
a
tad
too
watery
nevertheless
quite
an
easy
drinker
quite
sweet
but
with
a
little
bit
of
exotic
aromas
towards
the
end
im
not
sure
what
heather
flowers
would
taste
like
on
their
own
but
i
can
certainly
taste
them
after
smelling
them
theres
a
flowery
flavour
that
matches
the
flowery
aroma
very
well
complimented
by
very
subtle
hopping
mild
bitterness
light
bodied
and
finely
carbonated
it
feels
very
crisp
and
refreshing
the
flavour
and
aroma
is
a
little
bit
slight
and
onesided
but
also
quite
moreish
this
is
a
solid
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking

this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
and
is
an
interesting
brew
its
very
crisp
with
sweet
flora
of
heather
on
both
the
taste
and
the
nose
good
session
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
d
i
had
one
11
2
oz
bottle
and
could
have
another
but
after
that
my
personal
taste
would
beg
for
something
with
hops
the
sweet
malts
may
become
too
much
for
me
after
two
bottles
as
well
i
would
suggest
this
beer
to
someone
starting
to
get
into
the
craft
beer
scene
since
it
doesnt
really
have
any
overpowering
flavors
drinkability
this
beer
is
one
that
is
less
than
typical
but
is
still
highly
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
definitely
worth
the
try
even
if
only
for
its
unique
characteristics
drinkability
a
great
beer
and
definitely
one
of
the
more
unique
brews
ive
tried
very
tasty
and
definitely
worth
a
try
even
if
just
for
the
uniqueness
pours
a
hazy
dehydrated
urine
color
sorry
just
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
poor
odd
lacing
off
white
head
looks
like
apple
juice
and
hey
kinda
smells
like
apple
juice
actually
more
like
grape
juice
and
malt
nice
slightly
floral
the
taste
is
so
different
tart
candylike
sweetness
with
mellow
malt
a
lot
of
juice
like
qualities
slight
yeast
and
grain
very
short
dry
finish
i
really
enjoy
the
flavors
they
just
dont
remind
me
of
the
usual
qualities
of
beer
that
i
enjoy
so
much
low
carbonation
masked
alcohol
a
lot
more
scottish
malt
and
berries
as
it
warms
very
unique
reminds
me
of
a
white
wine
with
malt
would
make
an
excellent
summer
or
spring
brew
very
refreshing
drinkability
this
style
was
first
brewed
in
2000
b
c
and
i
just
tried
it
in
2010
a
d
so
i
guess
if
youve
got
a
good
thing
going
you
stick
with
it
if
you
see
this
one
anywhere
in
your
vicinity
i
recommend
you
pick
it
up
and
try
it
out
for
yourself
i
would
drink
this
one
more
often
if
it
was
readily
available
guess
i
might
just
have
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
scotland
and
round
up
some
more
slainte
mhath
very
easy
to
drink
this
goes
down
nicely
the
alcohol
isnt
over
the
top
and
there
is
some
nice
malt
flavour
notes
its
tact
might
be
a
shortcoming
at
times
in
particular
when
one
is
pleased
by
the
offering
and
would
hope
that
some
aspects
were
a
bit
more
assertive
but
the
brew
works
rather
well
as
it
is
makes
for
a
nice
social
ale
with
an
interesting
story
and
sturdy
craft
behind
it
my
first
heather
ale
its
a
pale
golden
brew
poured
a
1
finger
head
that
was
white
before
dissipating
had
a
little
bit
of
resiny
lacing
smells
light
malty
with
some
hops
and
floral
characteristics
taste
is
grassylike
with
some
bready
malt
sweetness
underneath
some
floral
type
hops
all
the
way
through
finish
dries
up
quickly
with
only
a
faint
bitterness
remaining
not
bad
i
didnt
really
like
the
mouthfeel
that
much
for
me
the
carbonation
level
was
a
little
too
high
i
think
for
the
flavors
going
on
it
could
have
been
smoother
its
pretty
thin
bodied
and
drinkable
though
i
didnt
find
the
style
was
really
something
i
enjoyed
all
that
much
not
sure
i
would
go
back
to
this
it
does
have
scottish
appeal
but
im
sure
there
are
better
offerrings
available
d
a
solid
beer
with
an
interesting
profile
different
i
would
gladly
like
to
have
this
again
in
the
future
overall
i
am
big
into
indigenous
cultures
and
ancient
recipes
so
naturally
i
would
be
attracted
to
this
beer
i
did
enjoy
this
brew
its
very
unique
and
nice
to
step
away
from
your
regular
ipa
to
try
something
like
this
i
didnt
find
it
phenomenal
but
i
would
gladly
have
it
again
taste
balanced
low
carbonation
herb
honey
beginning
and
slightly
bitter
hop
end
more
similar
to
classic
pale
ales
dry
aftertaste
beer
for
drinking
in
the
shade
on
hot
summers
noons
drinkability
definitely
something
good
to
try
out
because
of
its
uniqueness
but
not
something
i
could
drink
all
the
time
a
good
experience
beer
fraoch
is
an
interesting
offbeat
beer
i
would
have
tried
one
eventually
just
because
of
the
bottle
design
and
name
but
have
to
admit
it
was
to
try
a
scottish
gruit
now
that
i
have
i
believe
my
curiosity
has
been
permanently
satisfied
quite
high
carbonation
which
does
well
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
bitterness
body
is
too
thick
though
the
aroma
was
very
floral
and
it
abounded
out
of
the
glass
the
taste
was
semi
dry
and
had
a
slight
and
pleasant
bitterness
in
the
mouth
it
left
its
hoppiness
on
the
top
of
the
roof
of
the
mouth
i
found
it
a
very
enjoyable
ale
the
beer
drinks
incredibly
easily
and
has
very
low
alcohol
but
it
is
an
interesting
reference
point
for
those
who
want
to
taste
an
ancient
or
at
least
old
recipe
d
very
drinkable
although
not
quite
the
exotic
beverage
it
purports
to
be
in
a
word
inoffensive
overall
this
is
an
all
right
beer
id
heard
a
lot
about
it
and
was
expecting
something
drastically
different
than
anything
id
ever
had
but
this
was
somewhat
disappointing
its
very
refreshing
make
no
mistake
and
has
a
unique
floral
quality
its
just
lacking
in
big
flavor
definitely
worth
a
try
though
overall
a
nice
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
not
for
a
dark
autumn
evening
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
during
the
summer
this
tastes
kind
of
like
a
cross
between
beer
and
mint
tea
it
is
really
good
very
refreshing
i
guess
there
are
no
hops
in
this
but
yet
it
still
tastes
like
beer
kind
of
wish
i
had
bought
2
actually
because
i
want
another
beer
right
now
and
i
could
totally
go
for
another
of
these
i
will
be
buying
it
again
some
time
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
not
too
carbonated
overall
a
decent
beer
not
the
best
in
the
pack
and
not
something
i
would
probably
try
again
but
still
at
least
they
are
trying
something
different
overall
this
is
a
pedestrian
ale
i
could
see
someone
like
guiness
producing
it
has
high
drinkability
for
its
medium
alcohol
content
and
mild
flavor
palate
but
it
is
too
expensive
to
be
a
light
chugging
beer
yeah
hardly
the
most
exciting
beer
but
enjoyable
enough
for
what
it
is
d
a
brand
new
style
for
me
its
been
fun
trying
to
piece
this
one
apart
i
also
take
interest
in
the
whole
ancient
recipe
gimmick
although
if
the
aphrodesiac
properties
are
true
which
im
beginning
to
think
they
are
then
it
may
not
be
a
gimmick
at
all
damn
close
to
session
strength
and
on
point
for
weight
if
i
were
an
ancient
scot
there
would
be
jugs
all
day
son
nowadays
i
may
long
for
normal
beer
after
one
or
two
wheres
my
lass
overall
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
it
has
some
very
different
qualities
from
the
majority
of
beers
ive
had
however
it
seems
well
put
together
and
is
easy
to
drink
worth
checking
out
if
youve
never
tried
a
gruit
ill
keep
this
one
in
mind
when
the
next
scottish
gruit
comes
my
way
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
light
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
floral
with
some
fruits
and
hops
taste
is
rather
mild
some
herbs
and
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
drinkability
while
i
like
the
relatively
exotic
flavor
i
dont
know
that
i
would
call
this
a
session
beer
id
gladly
have
it
again
but
since
my
favorite
thing
about
this
beer
is
how
different
it
is
from
others
i
think
ill
wait
awhile
final
thoughts
this
one
seems
to
be
the
light
summer
beer
of
my
historic
ales
of
scotland
pack
this
stuff
is
meant
to
be
pounded
back
light
lagers
should
be
replaced
with
stuff
like
this
that
is
for
sure
all
that
being
said
though
this
is
the
most
disappointing
beer
in
the
pack
thus
far
its
good
and
has
its
place
even
if
it
was
a
bit
unexpected
nothing
fancy
here
this
was
probably
the
macro
brew
of
the
past
smells
a
lot
like
a
wheat
beer
ether
fruity
sweet
the
smell
does
not
match
the
flavor
unfortunately
there
is
almost
none
i
cannot
taste
any
heather
the
beer
is
fortunately
super
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
just
not
a
very
interesting
flavor
the
flavors
build
as
i
drink
more
i
dont
think
i
would
get
this
again
unfortunately
definitely
interesting
start
to
the
tasting
i
cant
imagine
i
got
the
full
effect
sipping
this
from
a
plastic
cupthe
sort
you
see
next
to
the
chair
at
the
dentists
officebut
still
it
was
like
something
from
a
time
long
past
this
is
how
beer
was
back
in
the
days
of
gruit
mead
and
the
bubonic
plague
its
easy
to
drink
being
so
light
and
the
alcohol
is
never
noticed
i
could
have
used
a
little
less
bitterness
but
then
i
see
some
reviewers
didnt
find
it
hoppy
at
all
so
to
each
his
own
i
guess
liked
this
one
a
bit
more
than
their
grozet
ale
subtle
complex
and
interesting
an
easy
quaffer
but
i
took
my
time
to
enjoy
this
one
2
down
and
2
to
go
d
interesting
and
quite
drinkable
nothing
too
awing
about
the
flavor
but
it
was
a
nice
brew
to
try
drink
ability
is
average
taste
is
odd
not
bad
just
not
that
great
dont
think
i
would
buy
again
but
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
low
carbonation
and
a
light
body
this
beer
was
nothing
special
and
kind
of
felt
flat
conclusion
this
is
another
really
cool
historical
ale
from
this
brewery
i
must
say
that
of
the
three
ive
had
from
craigmill
this
is
my
least
favorite
the
really
grassyflowery
flavors
are
pretty
nice
but
its
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
for
my
first
stab
at
an
ancient
style
im
very
pleased
this
is
a
refreshing
brew
as
well
as
mildly
complex
drinkablity
is
very
good
a
wonderful
taste
with
a
light
abv
makes
this
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
i
could
certainly
have
a
few
of
these
at
one
time
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
poured
a
hazed
semitranslucent
straw
tinged
amber
color
thin
and
sticky
head
smells
sweetly
of
flowers
thistle
herbs
and
honey
light
biscuity
aroma
taste
is
reminiscent
of
a
ricola
throat
lozenge
but
in
good
way
starts
sweet
and
flowery
before
slowly
transitioning
into
a
more
herbal
complexity
slightly
bittersweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
coats
the
throat
and
mouth
seems
syrupy
but
has
a
lighter
feel
thanks
to
moderate
levels
of
carbonation
overall
a
great
beer
very
different
experience
that
doesnt
disappoint
however
i
cant
see
drinking
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
as
the
sweetness
and
herbal
notes
might
overpower
the
senses
as
neither
are
shy
in
this
brew
recommend
trying
would
purchase
again
this
was
a
refreshing
brew
that
tastes
great
with
a
little
patience
very
drinkable
d
a
light
easy
going
beer
with
sweet
smooth
enjoyable
flavors
i
have
regrettably
passed
this
over
so
many
times
worth
a
try
for
sure
this
beer
pours
a
pale
cloudy
straw
colour
that
has
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
head
and
a
ring
of
lacing
around
the
top
it
almost
looks
identical
to
a
organic
pilsnerit
has
a
real
floralminty
herbal
smell
about
itthe
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
even
thinner
than
most
pilsners
and
it
has
a
real
floral
minty
taste
about
it
and
to
be
honest
i
definately
prefer
a
hop
taste
than
this
taste
so
for
me
drinkability
isnt
high
as
it
tastes
kinda
bland
but
i
spose
i
love
my
hops
so
u
might
call
me
biased
notes
this
is
a
very
interesting
flavored
beer
with
a
very
interesting
history
to
the
style
of
the
beer
light
to
medium
bodied
but
seems
a
little
flat
with
not
much
carbonation
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
one
but
it
turned
out
to
be
very
interesting
not
something
i
would
normally
drink
but
very
refreshing
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
33cl
bottle
pours
clear
gold
with
a
surprisingly
full
white
head
that
lasts
smells
very
floral
and
sweet
with
nice
malt
character
aromas
reminiscent
of
honey
and
ginger
taste
is
again
quite
floral
with
nice
spicy
notes
full
grainy
malt
dry
finish
lightmedium
body
having
no
expectations
going
into
this
one
it
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
this
is
kind
of
drinkable
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
only
real
drawback
for
me
regarding
this
beer
is
the
thin
watery
texture
in
the
mouth
it
has
just
a
hint
of
effervescence
but
nowhere
near
enough
to
carry
the
interesting
flavors
through
to
the
finish
its
a
refreshing
beer
that
i
would
enjoy
again
even
colder
next
time
scotland
is
said
to
have
10
million
acres
of
wild
flowering
heather
i
for
one
wouldnt
mind
seeing
each
and
every
one
of
those
acres
dedicated
to
the
production
of
heather
ale
ok
maybe
leave
a
few
for
ornamental
considerations
the
flowers
are
pretty
fraoch
is
a
fine
ale
more
so
enjoyable
than
peculiar
but
somewhat
distinguishing
nevertheless
there
is
a
simple
reason
this
style
ale
has
survived
since
2000
b
c
its
good
drinkability
is
just
ok
the
taste
is
good
but
without
some
carbonation
it
would
get
old
very
fast
d
not
a
beer
that
i
would
recommend
throwing
back
quickly
the
thickness
of
the
beer
makes
you
relax
and
enjoy
the
floral
nature
overall
it
is
a
tasty
beverage
a
very
round
and
very
floral
finish
give
a
wholesome
taste
to
the
end
drinkable
and
welcoming
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
definitely
intend
on
getting
this
again
super
awesome
d
this
beer
is
refreshing
with
enough
unique
details
to
recommend
i
particularly
like
the
unique
taste
and
mouthfeel
combination
this
beer
has
when
sipped
it
is
at
first
flowery
and
carbonated
but
this
immediately
evaporates
into
a
very
clean
dryness
with
a
lingering
spice
overall
nice
unusual
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
a
second
but
might
want
to
switch
it
up
after
that
pours
a
yellow
orange
color
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
it
glows
and
stirs
up
tiny
bubbles
with
each
swig
floral
fruity
and
unique
in
aroma
the
heather
flowers
add
an
interesting
component
viscous
definitely
a
hearty
brew
big
body
for
a
5er
sweet
and
lots
of
herbal
tea
on
the
back
end
with
some
subtle
fruity
bitterness
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
its
everywhere
the
price
is
right
its
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
youve
never
had
it
before
try
the
500ml
format
though
to
me
it
tastes
weirder
in
a
good
way
although
i
have
not
sampled
it
since
the
change
over
from
the
german
style
bottles
to
the
large
beer
bottle
shape
format
drinkability
very
interesting
and
quite
good
definitely
something
i
could
get
again
d
light
very
pleasant
flavor
and
low
alcohol
incredibly
drinkable
the
sweetness
is
a
touch
too
much
as
the
bottle
progresses
and
the
flavors
perhaps
a
little
too
repetitive
but
this
is
a
nice
unique
beer
that
if
given
the
chance
i
would
have
again
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
stingy
white
head
that
leaves
my
glass
quickly
smells
of
cooked
corn
subtle
floral
fragrance
which
i
assume
is
heather
a
bit
of
ginger
some
grainy
malt
maybe
a
bit
of
toffee
as
well
taste
is
floral
herbal
with
a
grainy
honey
malt
kind
of
feel
to
it
crisp
carbonation
medium
body
sweet
thin
syrupy
mouthfeel
i
liked
this
one
its
different
but
the
herbs
dont
attack
you
like
some
other
gruit
brews
that
ive
tried
light
crisp
and
clean
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
id
drink
this
more
d
if
this
wasnt
so
sweet
it
would
be
really
drinkable
but
ive
been
nursing
one
for
45
minutes
and
probably
wont
finish
it
drinkability
if
youre
up
for
a
little
more
honesty
then
here
it
is
ive
always
generally
avoided
this
one
but
i
find
it
surprisingly
refreshing
and
very
easily
drinkable
maybe
ill
give
that
alba
a
try
one
of
these
days
i
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
whispy
white
head
the
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
and
a
bit
floral
the
flavor
was
sweet
adn
light
no
real
bitterness
there
were
floral
and
vanilla
notes
the
brew
was
light
in
body
and
had
average
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
the
beer
was
damn
drinkable
and
when
i
was
done
i
was
craving
another
i
bought
this
just
to
try
the
style
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
ill
have
to
try
more
of
this
style
aformentioned
taste
is
really
interesting
a
little
spicy
in
a
hoplike
way
and
also
both
herbal
and
floral
in
a
very
different
way
than
hops
can
be
i
fear
my
inexperience
in
reviewing
leaves
me
without
the
terminology
to
describe
it
this
is
my
first
gruit
but
its
very
high
drinkability
will
bring
me
back
to
the
style
whenever
i
run
across
it
thinbodied
smmooth
sweet
and
simple
like
koolaid
there
are
hints
of
honey
and
herbal
tealike
hops
mixed
with
something
akin
to
oak
and
minor
sweet
malts
wouldnt
call
this
a
sweet
version
of
a
fruit
beer
but
beer
traditionalists
might
i
myself
enjoyed
the
simple
sweetness
brought
out
by
this
beer
along
with
the
somewhat
fruit
juice
flavors
in
it
and
could
have
this
again
anytime
really
good
shit
a
great
one
of
a
kind
experience
for
those
whove
never
had
this
sort
of
thing
d
i
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
the
sweetness
balances
well
with
the
heather
d
fraoch
is
quite
drinkable
simply
because
of
how
interesting
and
unique
it
is
the
sweetness
is
slightly
detrimental
and
i
cant
help
but
wonder
if
this
is
due
in
part
by
the
lack
of
carbonation
my
main
complaint
is
that
i
wish
there
was
some
accompanying
malt
backbone
to
the
heather
that
was
used
the
flavor
was
interesting
but
i
think
it
couldve
excelled
as
more
than
a
novelty
if
thered
been
some
interplay
between
malt
and
heather
in
the
end
this
isnt
something
id
drink
all
that
often
because
its
a
little
too
sweet
and
the
flavor
is
a
bit
lacking
still
a
unique
and
ineteresting
beer
but
i
doubt
it
will
ever
ascend
from
novelty
i
look
forward
to
the
other
brews
in
the
variety
pack
historic
ales
of
scotland
that
i
got
fraoch
in
i
imagine
you
could
have
done
a
lot
worse
4000
years
ago
i
could
drink
this
beer
quite
often
it
is
light
and
delicate
and
would
be
very
sessionable
shame
i
only
bought
one
edit
as
i
keep
drinking
this
beer
its
changing
character
as
it
warms
i
do
believe
one
shouldnt
taste
this
beer
refrigerated
it
is
picking
up
a
much
more
candylike
aroma
its
very
mysterious
because
i
can
almost
recognize
it
but
its
too
elusive
d
somewhat
like
drinking
smoky
beerflavored
water
dont
think
ill
have
another
quite
an
interesting
brew
but
rather
pleasant
as
well
replacing
the
hops
with
the
herbs
used
creates
a
profile
that
is
alien
to
the
palate
but
one
which
is
easy
to
cope
with
and
enjoy
d
probably
never
get
this
again
not
that
it
was
horrible
just
not
my
type
of
beer
but
it
is
unique
a
really
strange
brew
not
something
id
like
every
day
but
on
oddity
that
was
worth
trying
i
wonder
if
hopinfused
beers
would
taste
as
bizarre
to
the
ancient
scots
how
often
does
one
have
a
heather
ale
so
it
is
difficult
to
compare
it
against
others
of
the
style
notwithstanding
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
the
nose
on
the
beer
is
honeyed
sweetness
plenty
floral
and
sweet
but
very
light
malts
the
beer
is
quite
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
it
is
very
refreshing
very
floral
and
the
sunflower
like
tastes
are
obviously
the
heather
the
beer
is
quite
honey
sweet
no
hop
bitterness
in
the
least
the
ibu
on
this
beer
would
be
in
the
single
digits
the
aftertaste
is
very
light
sweet
and
very
unbeer
like
the
abv
is
completely
hidden
this
is
a
nice
change
up
and
worth
seeking
out
to
taste
what
heather
is
like
in
a
beer
it
is
light
not
at
all
prickly
and
probably
mead
like
in
some
ways
cheers
very
interesting
brew
and
unusual
style
i
cant
say
that
i
knew
what
to
expect
so
this
could
easily
be
the
best
heather
ale
out
there
but
i
dont
have
a
comparison
worth
a
shot
for
historys
sake
deasy
to
drink
could
very
well
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
mouth
is
crisp
and
clean
drinks
very
easy
i
would
definitely
consider
this
for
a
tasting
especially
during
the
warmer
months
of
the
year
incidentally
according
to
the
brewery
website
www
fraoch
com
williams
bros
is
the
new
name
for
brewery
craigmill
the
company
relocated
to
a
larger
facility
in
alloa
to
keep
up
with
demand
and
changed
their
name
so
this
is
the
same
beer
as
the
craigmill
fraoch
drinkability
i
could
have
a
six
but
this
is
an
aquired
taste
this
is
my
favorite
in
the
scottish
ales
pack
i
have
this
does
have
pronounced
lavender
notes
as
well
as
some
other
floralsand
i
like
lavender
so
it
is
a
plus
quite
a
fruit
palate
as
well
quite
light
and
frothy
with
a
slight
tartness
that
announces
itself
quite
meekly
without
any
mouthpuckering
or
courage
speaking
both
literally
and
metaphorically
there
quite
a
sweet
finish
actually
with
the
only
bitterness
coming
somewhere
between
the
front
and
the
middle
of
the
palate
topography
finish
is
like
a
light
unwooded
chardonnay
ie
crap
again
warming
up
may
go
some
way
to
improving
the
character
but
its
otherwise
not
a
stupefying
drop
anyway
mouthfeel
is
quite
thing
and
although
its
lack
of
body
makes
it
drinkable
this
beer
is
otherwise
a
disappointment
to
its
parents
its
family
and
its
country
drinkability
this
is
a
tasty
little
number
one
that
i
will
recommend
to
my
friends
if
all
scottish
gruit
is
this
good
im
definitely
a
new
fan
of
the
style
another
perfect
session
just
this
one
i
dont
inbibe
in
often
a
thick
rocky
head
sits
atop
a
young
mead
im
ecstatic
about
the
spicysweet
aroma
is
this
heather
im
in
heaven
my
first
time
with
her
and
shes
smells
better
outta
the
bottle
a
light
body
carries
thick
honey
a
touch
of
caramel
a
symphony
of
fragrant
flowers
not
nescessarily
of
heather
now
thinking
lillys
and
honey
suckle
the
heather
provides
a
dash
of
warming
cinnamon
and
possibly
nutmeg
definitely
vanilla
easy
body
refreshing
and
crisp
held
together
aesthetically
by
light
lacing
superb
d
very
good
and
very
dry
i
could
go
all
night
over
cards
if
you
wish
but
bring
plenty
of
cash
bloke
aroma
from
the
bottle
is
strong
and
rich
smells
of
heather
flowers
and
grass
notes
cloudy
golden
in
color
with
white
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
from
the

similar
to
the

with
some

and
unique

a
great
session
beer
for
any
season
d
certainly
a
change
of
pace
a
nice
beer
that
im
glad
i
finally
tried
very
drinkable
and
gentle
d
a
interesting
beer
something
that
i
would
have
again
i
would
recommend
this
not
only
for
its
uniquness
but
it
is
also
truly
refreshing

tasty

it
was
a
unique
beer
ill
give
them
that
one
was
it
good
not
bad
but
if
you
like
the
taste
of
flowers
then
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
you
would
i
drink
it
again
i
fully
doubt
it
it
was
too
light
and
too
flowery
out
of
the
4
gruits
ive
had
from
them
this
is
the
one
i
cared
least
for
flower
power
from
a
350
ml
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
beautiful
amberishorange
color
that
ive
not
seen
much
smell
is
actually
quite
mild
picked
up
some
sweetness
from
sniffing
the
bottle
before
pouring
but
not
much
aroma
at
all
after
pouring
the
taste
is
quite
mild
with
an
interesting
sweetness
and
almost
no
bitter
whatsoever
perhaps
this
is
from
the
heathergale
substitution
for
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
it
has
a
sort
of
stickiness
read
someone
else
mentioning
that
as
well
and
the
light
carbonation
gives
it
a
nice
bite
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
at
the
same
time
i
found
myself
not
liking
it
near
as
much
as
i
hoped
i
would
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
this
one
pours
a
light
semihazy
apricot
color
with
little
to
no
head
at
all
it
smells
like
heather
whatever
that
is
and
honey
tastes
very
light
and
floral
with
some
herbal
notes
the
reason
i
rate
this
one
high
is
due
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
recipe
from
2000bc
not
many
people
in
their
life
get
to
try
something
that
has
been
around
over
a
hundred
years
let
alone
4000
definitely
worth
it
for
your
beerhistory
geek
d
this
is
one
of
those
oddly
endearing
beers
id
never
had
this
style
before
that
i
remember
but
im
going
to
try
to
find
others
the
taste
is
nothing
too
crazy
and
is
very
malty
without
much
balance
this
beer
is
not
made
with
hops
so
its
not
very
bitter
that
being
said
its
not
sweet
either
very
earthy
floral
taste
worth
checking
out
but
its
not
as
good
complex
as
some
other
scottish
gruits
a
little
1
dimensional
quite
limited
not
complex
at
all
and
not
very
flavorful
glad
to
have
tried
this
different
beer
but
not
coming
back
pours
a
cloudy
goldyorange
with
minimal
head
minimal
lacing
as
well
floral
aroma
with
honey
mixed
in
honey
appears
to
provide
the
primary
taste
it
is
very
interesting
and
different
from
anything
ive
had
so
far
quite
good
in
its
uniqueness
mouthfeel
is
solid
balanced
medium
light
with
a
touch
of
sticky
sweetness
one
is
very
drinkable
however
i
dont
see
going
beyond
a
couple
as
while
it
is
unique
it
doesnt
fit
my
personal
preference
for
beer
i
do
recommend
trying
it
since
it
is
a
supposedly
ancient
type
of
beer
and
therefore
worth
experiencing
this
is
my
first
gruit
ale
bog
myrtle
and
heather
in
this
beer
im
drinking
this
out
of
my
wooden
mug
from
the
renaissance
festival
it
seemed
appropriate
i
can
only
comment
on
the
color
as
i
poured
and
the
head
which
is
white
and
frothy
and
drops
to
a
thin
layer
with
a
good
amount
of
lacing
it
smells
a
bit
like
a
saison
sour
and
spicy
but
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
english
tea
which
i
think
is
good
regardless
its
a
light
fresh
and
damn
tasty
beer
i
can
see
why
its
been
brewed
for
over
4000
years
this
is
my
first
gruit
and
it
is
very
interesting
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
style
at
all
but
it
reminds
me
of
a
saison
recommended
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
obviously
different
than
anything
else
pours
a
one
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
hazy
amber
color
mellow
sweet
nose
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
flavor
is
sweet
doughy
and
mellow
better
flavor
as
it
warms
4
10
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
i
know
its
not
the
proper
glassware
per
ba
but
wanted
it
all
in
one
glass
hazy
orange
with
yellow
highlights
aroma
of
crisp
grainy
malt
honey
slightly
floral
slightly
sweet
nice
flavor
of
pale
malts
somewhat
sweet
hints
of
lemon
and
grass
interestingly
floral
not
sure
what
the
flowers
heather
are
supposed
to
taste
like
but
theres
something
different
there
that
i
havent
tasted
before
must
be
the
heather
right
creamy
on
the
tongue
good
carbonation
slightly
warming
which
is
strange
considering
the
low
abv
a
very
interesting
and
different
beer
its
kinda
strange
not
having
any
hop
aroma
or
flavor
but
its
a
nice
change
and
a
nice
treat
everyone
should
try
this
interesting
style
at
least
once
quite
drinkable
but
lacks
complexity
and
doesnt
keep
my
interest
very
long
d
fraoch
heather
ale
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
bottles
in
a
sitting
without
getting
bored
or
too
intoxicated
good
beer
will
have
to
purchase
again
recommended
pours
a
cloudy
toasted
grain
color
with
a
small
but
dense
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
toasted
malt
with
some
mild
fruit
herbal
scents
the
taste
has
a
malty
sweetness
honey
lemon
with
a
flowery
herbal
presence
nothing
distinct
but
well
balanced
the
feel
is
moderate
with
active
carbonation
finishes
dry
an
average
brew
at
best
combines
a
pale
ale
with
some
flowery
herbal
notes
but
nothing
that
is
outstanding
try
it
you
might
like
it
to
hell
with
hopheads
d
i
wouldnt
drink
these
all
night
long
but
it
was
nice
tasting
d
this
was
my
first
gruit
im
open
to
trying
more
but
im
not
willing
to
go
to
great
lengths
to
get
another
one
d
split
a
12oz
bottle
nice
beer
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
glad
someone
is
making
this
style
still
d
an
odd
beer
one
im
glad
i
tried
i
would
drink
again
if
only
for
the
aromatics
notefirst
attempt
at
the
style
not
sure
if
a
thin
head
is
standard
for
the
style
rather
enjoyable
and
i
guess
sessionable
an
interesting
mix
of
beer
and
heather
md
light
bodied
and
softlycarbonated
this
delicious
beer
somehow
tastes
much
better
cool
than
chilled
as
my
coldserving
for
the
last
bottle
several
months
ago
was
nowhere
as
good
as
the
glass
tonight
without
the
use
of
hops
the
heather
flower
is
never
imposing
on
the
palate
while
the
bitterness
is
still
prevalent
and
mixed
with
unknown
herbal
edges
and
spices
making
it
a
really
quaffable
ale
d
this
seems
like
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
the
backyard
on
a
nice
day
definitely
a
great
session
beer
interesting
to
try
but
not
something
i
can
drink
more
than
one
of
bottlecap
says
williams
brothers
brewing
co
so
thats
why
im
posting
this
review
under
this
listing
for
fraoch
heather
ale
instead
of
the
other
listing
for
the
beer
this
starts
out
slow
but
evolves
into
a
very
enjoyable
offering
would
be
a
good
nightcap
for
the
first
fireplace
use
of
late
fallwinter
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
musttry
beer
if
only
for
its
unique
ingredients
and
taste
i
will
enjoy
drinking
it
while
i
have
it
but
wouldnt
make
it
a
staple
notes
all
in
all
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
a
warm
spring
day
in
the
sun
having
an
outdoor
lunch
would
be
the
ideal
setting
for
this
beer
in
a
dark
dreary
pub
in
the
dead
of
winter
this
beer
would
be
out
of
place
a
food
beer
maybe
with
camembert
or
better
yet
shy
brothers
farm
hannahbells
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
the
herbal
taste
might
get
irritating
after
a
few
an
interesting
and
drinkable
style
here
nothing
totally
fancy
its
a
change
from
other
styles
not
something
that
id
drink
more
than
once
though
carbonation
was
light
and
made
for
an
easy
to
drink
beer
but
the
flavor
is
too
strong
and
more
than
one
or
two
would
probably
be
too
much
drinkability
is
very
high
unless
you
account
for
the
high
price
tag
sell
me
this
for
8
a
six
pack
and
you
have
my
standby
beer
d
as
an
ancient
style
this
ale
should
be
given
a
shot
by
all
serious
beer
geeks
not
my
favorite
but
damn
drinkable
and
i
can
certainly
appreciate
it
d
got
to
be
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
brews
ive
ever
had
wonderful
for
giving
to
someone
who
hates
beer
the
only
thing
i
would
change
up
the
crispness
d
very
easy
going
tasty
and
refreshing
very
natural
flavours
and
a
very
modest
abv
make
this
a
great
session
candidate
the
floral
flavours
and
touch
of
crisp
feel
present
a
brew
that
would
be
fantastic
on
the
nicer
days
of
spring
drinkability
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
to
make
this
very
special
its
just
got
nothing
but
a
little
spice
it
diesnt
hold
up
well
i
could
probably
finish
this
in
about
5
seconds
if
i
wanted
to
this
ones
just
not
worth
it
drinkability
the
heather
taste
is
far
to
faint
to
make
it
very
drinkable
not
much
character
to
this
one
not
unpleasant
but
nothing
memorable
either
d
i
think
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
if
not
a
little
bit
odd
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
no
hops
were
used
as
its
very
nicely
balanced
theres
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
nowhere
near
as
expected
also
its
mildly
pleasant
compared
to
most
gruitlike
beers
ive
had
most
of
which
are
barely
drinkable
to
my
tastes
pretty
drinkable
a
crisp
and
interesting
beer
what
a
unique
and
fantastic
brew
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
very
much
a
floral
taste
with
a
nice
malt
background
notes
of
honey
also
present
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
i
can
imagine
having
quite
a
few
in
one
sitting
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
would
substitute
wherever
dry
white
wine
would
work
but
i
miss
the
hops
eric
d
drinkable
and
interesting
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
and
lot
of
but
would
come
back
to
it
occasionally
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
i
cant
say
that
im
a
huge
fan
its
certainly
worth
checking
out
given
its
unique
flavor
and
left
of
center
style
but
the
nose
and
the
flavor
need
to
be
a
little
more
pronounced
to
elevate
it
to
a
good
beer
worth
a
try
nonetheless
not
as
weird
as
i
anticipated
interesting
worth
a
try
a
very
interesting
brew
a
lighter
ale
and
a
nice
alternative
if
one
is
tired
of
hop
heavy
beers
this
would
probably
be
good
while
tending
sheep
in
crappy
weather
as
far
as
comparisons
to
other
beers
the
thing
this
most
reminds
me
of
is
the
ginger
honey
ale
available
in
sam
adams
brewer
patriot
collection
i
loved
that
beer
for
its
differentness
its
pleasantly
carbonated
and
nectarlike
flavor
is
the
fraoch
worth
four
and
a
half
bucks
maybe
not
but
its
probably
worth
it
once
and
12
dollars
for
the
historic
beers
of
scotland
pack
is
definitely
so
pretty
much
one
beer
for
free
pours
a
cloudy
haystraw
color
with
a
decent
forming
white
head
that
slowly
dissipated
the
smell
was
very
subtle
but
earthy
for
lac
of
a
better
word
first
sip
and
i
said
gingerbread
definitely
gingerbread
thats
al
i
could
think
about
whil
i
was
drinking
it
as
i
continued
to
sip
the
earthiness
came
forward
as
i
was
trying
to
dissect
the
tatses
light
mouthfeel
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
those
who
like
dry
white
wine
will
most
likely
enjoy
this
floral
nose
sweet
start
dry
finish
refreshing
pairs
well
with
salmon
or
a
salad
with
warm
bacon
dressing
highly
drinkable
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
this
is
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
nose
is
full
of
flowers
and
light
springtime
tones
not
your
usual
hoppy
beer
aromas
the
taste
follows
right
along
with
the
initial
impression
from
the
smell
lots
of
honey
and
sweetness
once
again
no
hop
taste
the
sweetness
and
easy
drinkability
can
almost
cause
you
to
drink
it
too
fast
and
not
sit
back
and
enjoy
it
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
those
who
are
not
big
on
hops
or
bitterness
lots
of
carbonation
very
bubbly
gave
it
an
interesting
mouthfeel
ok
drinkability
a
unique
style
actually
i
was
pretty
impressed
d
this
was
pretty
good
only
the
second
beer
of
this
style
that
ive
had
but
i
enjoyed
it
drinkability
here
is
good
but
its
not
something
im
going
to
drink
everyday
if
your
a
fan
of
this
style
as
i
am
this
is
definately
one
of
the
best
wow
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
gruit
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
new
belgium
tulip
the
aroma
is
earthy
and
floral
its
honestly
kind
of
off
putting
the
taste
reminds
me
off
smelling
flowers
in
my
folks
garden
you
get
a
hefty
amount
of
flowers
but
you
still
get
that
earth
worm
manure
mixtures
also
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
i
can
honestly
say
i
probably
wont
drink
this
beer
again
d
very
interesting
brew
one
id
enjoy
again
without
hesitation
if
you
havent
tried
a
heather
ale
yet
this
is
a
very
tasty
one
to
start
with
a
very
different
beer
and
it
is
a
must
try
for
any
beer
geek
got
this
in
a
hisoric
ales
of
scotland
mix
pack
at
wards
market
in
gainesville
had
it
chilled
in
a
cool
free
sam
adams
glass
poured
a
light
reddish
gold
color
similar
to
a
well
aged
scotch
with
lots
a
tiny
bubbles
rising
up
there
was
a
small
white
head
that
dissapated
quickly
the
smell
was
almost
non
existant
until
the
beer
actually
warmed
up
then
the
heather
blossom
honey
and
malt
notes
came
out
the
taste
was
really
sweet
like
honeydew
melon
but
there
was
a
flower
petal
like
finish
that
dried
on
the
way
down
all
around
a
good
after
dinner
beer
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
its
a
decent
beer
but
for
me
the
flavor
just
prevents
me
from
wanting
to
drink
it
again
with
a
few
more
tastings
i
could
probably
grasp
the
style
a
little
better
and
i
think
this
beer
has
potential
if
you
understand
what
the
purpose
of
the
ancient
ale
style
is
and
what
to
take
from
it
im
not
there
yet
though
pours
a
brilliant
golden
color
pretty
tiny
head
though
not
much
lacing
the
main
scent
must
be
the
heather
ive
never
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
this
heather
but
it
has
to
be
her
scent
taste
is
the
heather
i
guess
very
floral
roses
no
real
hop
character
nice
subtle
sweet
malt
flavor
pretty
full
bodied
medium
carbo
dry
finish
very
interesting
recipe
i
really
liked
it
couldnt
drink
it
all
night
but
well
worth
finding
i
will
buy
it
again
overall
an
okay
beer
and
certainly
an
interesting
thing
to
try
but
i
dont
think
i
will
try
this
one
ever
again
but
i
might
make
a
heather
beer
sometime
on
my
own
this
was
enjoyable
something
different
but
light
and
drinkable
flavors
blend
together
well
interesting
though
too
similar
to
a
golden
euro
lager
even
though
its
an
ale
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
new
and
i
can
certainly
appreciate
something
outside
of
the
ordinary
one
could
quaff
a
good
amount
of
this
and
would
be
continually
drawn
to
the
simplicity
of
drinkability
paired
with
the
faint
complexities
and
subtleties
quite
enjoyable
the
flavors
here
are
a
bit
mild
so
id
recommend
pairing
this
with
something
lighter
like
a
salad
or
mild
cheese
still
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
tasty
deviation
for
my
typical
beer
drinking
i
havent
had
much
like
it
and
recommend
this
to
anyone
interested
in
trying
the
style
its
a
very
interesting
brew
that
im
not
quite
sure
what
to
think
of
it
is
pleasant
and
fairly
refreshing
yet
probably
not
something
i
would
come
back
to
too
often
definitely
worth
a
try
though
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
brews
i
have
ever
tasted
the
aroma
is
of
honey
the
taste
is
smooth
malt
and
again
hints
of
honey
and
it
goes
down
smoothly
loses
a
couple
of
points
for
the
weak
head
but
more
than
makes
up
for
it
with
pure
flavor
cheers
to
the
scots
for
brewing
up
this
unique
ale
i
hate
reading
peoples
reviews
that
say
its
too
malty
or
its
too
plain
the
style
really
needs
to
be
taken
into
account
when
reviewed
not
just
how
it
pairs
up
against
an
iipa
or
istout
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
unique
im
glad
that
beers
like
this
are
still
being
made
well
worth
a
try
i
fear
the
sweetness
makes
this
an
occassional
offereing
for
this
cat
slightly
hazy
deep
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
aromas
of
lychee
fruit
chamomile
and
a
slight
hint
of
vomit
not
joking
flavors
of
light
malt
mild
flowery
fruit
chamomile
tea
this
almost
tastes
like
a
belgian
blonde
ale
medium
body
with
a
light
herbal
bitter
finish
this
is
not
bad
at
all
if
there
are
zero
hops
in
this
beer
havent
checked
yet
then
i
am
glad
to
know
that
i
can
survive
in
a
beer
world
without
them
but
i
would
miss
them
md
the
body
mouthfeel
for
this
is
rather
light
with
a
dry
finish
the
linger
is
nice
with
some
herbal
bittering
carbonation
is
tricky
too
as
it
doesnt
appear
to
be
very
carbonated
but
the
abundance
of
small
bubbles
seems
to
work
well
with
the
dry
finish
accentuating
it
this
is
a
very
different
sort
of
brew
but
i
really
think
i
like
it
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
wow
im
really
surprised
by
this
beer
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
spiced
beers
or
any
beer
where
i
can
tell
that
spices
have
been
added
but
this
beer
works
for
me
i
guess
4000
years
of
brewing
lets
you
figure
out
a
way
to
make
it
taste
good
while
i
dont
see
this
beer
becoming
a
part
of
my
regular
rotation
i
could
see
myself
buying
it
again
a
great
unique
beer
a
novelty
but
also
well
crafted
and
i
could
easily
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
flavours
are
so
unique
and
it
provides
for
a
very
memorable
taste
experience
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
addictive
now
i
want
to
try
more
ancient
ales
if
you
come
across
this
beer
buy
it
you
wont
regret
it
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
quite
a
unique
brew
but
the
refined
character
works
towards
the
strange
mix
of
flavors
present
to
provide
a
smooth
and
drinkable
brew
provided
the
drinker
does
not
take
offense
to
the
actual
mix
of
flavors
present
cheers
if
youre
looking
for
something
totally
unique
give
it
a
try
theres
definitely
nothing
that
ive
tried
that
comes
close
im
happy
for
the
experience
but
i
probably
wont
be
returning
to
this
one
d
good
drinkability
unique
flavor
keeps
things
interesting
thoughout
the
course
of
the
drink
a
definite
recommend
for
something
different
d
reasonable
drinkability
but
hardly
inspiring
especially
at
5
for
a
12oz
bottle
reminds
me
of
an
average
quality
german
pilsner
herbal
but
not
particularly
crisp
or
refreshing
this
was
a
unique
beer
that
i
have
heard
has
a
taste
very
similar
to
what
a
mead
would
have
been
like
brewed
with
honey
flowers
and
herbs
this
is
a
really
interesting
ale
it
definatly
has
a
strong
presence
of
herbs
and
spices
which
combines
to
make
an
original
flavor
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
medium
light
in
body
with
lower
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
pretty
much
sums
up
the
feel
of
this
brew
as
as
to
drinkabilty
i
personally
find
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
12
of
theses
in
one
sitting
the
extreme
flavor
and
forwardness
of
the
herbs
just
is
too
much
for
me
still
this
is
a
brew
that
ill
always
be
coming
back
to
great
taste
to
this
one
really
do
like
it
but
it
is
something
that
is
better
when
you
dont
drink
it
all
the
time
there
isnt
any
overall
distinction
that
i
can
see
for
this
beer
but
i
may
have
opened
an
older
bottle
i
dont
know
how
long
it
may
have
been
setting
at
the
distributer
but
the
drinkby
date
is
august
2008
so
i
feel
safe
in
this
review
pours
out
nicely
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
great
scent
a
very
earthy
and
floral
malt
aroma
excellent
taste
not
only
is
it
a
great
beer
to
try
for
uniqueness
but
its
good
on
its
own
anyway
a
very
refreshing
flavor
with
a
nice
maltiness
and
a
great
floralheather
flavor
goes
down
very
easily
in
fact
im
quite
sad
since
im
nearly
finished
with
the
scots
historic
pack
i
have
guess
ill
have
to
get
more
a
very
interesting
brew
and
with
its
rich
history
this
was
certainly
worth
a
try
paid
almost
5
for
a
500
ml
bottle
from
total
wine
and
more
in
west
orange
pours
a
slightorange
applejuice
color
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
similar
to
that
of
a
floral
bouqet
very
light
mild
with
some
minimal
citrus
overtones
taste
was
very
crisp
and
clear
with
floral
notes
no
bitterness
and
an
easygoing
refreshing
charachter
a
very
unique
and
light
brew
which
goes
down
as
easily
as
a
bottle
of
water
excellent
mouthfeel
and
superb
drinkability
lead
to
a
satisfying
and
enjoyable
brew
that
would
be
a
pleasure
to
drink
anytime
a
musttry
and
definitely
recommended
d
all
in
all
id
say
this
is
pretty
drinkable
interesting
enough
to
have
as
a
stand
alone
and
low
enough
in
abv
to
drink
more
than
1
if
you
want
a
decent
brew
certainly
worth
a
try
d
this
is
the
second
gruit
that
i
have
tried
and
i
like
the
style
but
not
better
then
i
like
about
10
other
styles
overall
i
say
buy
it
if
you
have
the
chance
its
an
interesting
beer
mild
but
has
a
slight
edge
on
the
tongue
it
is
brewed
using
heather
flowers
and
scottish
malt
so
you
get
a
light
petal
textureflavor
across
the
palate
this
is
another
connoisseurs
beer
best
enjoyed
by
someone
who
can
appreciate
its
complexities
also
bestenjoyed
when
fresh
poured
a
cloudy
dark
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
floral
and
it
smells
of
nectar
taste
is
sweet
also
but
is
balanced
by
the
malt
this
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
and
easy
drinking
not
much
lacing
on
the
glass
not
necessarily
something
i
would
seek
out
but
i
would
not
turn
down
another
either
tried
this
oncask
last
night
was
sevearly
lacking
in
flavor
color
and
texture
very
flat
im
sure
the
cask
has
something
to
do
with
that
and
kindof
watery
some
floral
notes
came
through
as
it
warmed
but
it
was
a
very
lackluster
beer
overall
not
one
that
i
would
recommend
in
the
least
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
not
memorable
tastes
flowery
earthy
herbal
pale
malt
and
some
spices
it
took
a
few
sips
for
me
to
start
to
develop
a
taste
for
this
brew
an
interesting
beer
that
despite
the
lower
score
i
recommend
trying
for
historical
curiosity
im
wonder
how
similar
this
is
to
what
was
brewed
a
few
thousand
years
ago
overall
score
71100
d
fraoch
is
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
it
is
rather
mild
but
has
enough
interesting
flavor
to
keep
the
tongue
intrigued
abv
isnt
very
high
and
the
mild
heather
and
herbal
notes
are
satisfying
over
top
of
the
regular
malt
profile
the
spicing
and
expensive
fourpacks
are
a
bit
much
for
me
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
as
i
have
a
friend
who
is
allergic
to
hops
id
recommend
a
ba
try
it
at
least
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
carbonated
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
a
welcome
change
of
pace
if
you
can
find
the
scottish
fourpack
of
these
gruit
ales
then
i
would
certainly
recommend
trying
em
if
youre
feeling
adventurous
drinkability
heather
fraoch
in
irish
is
used
instead
of
hops
to
amoratiser
this
genuine
beer
d
interesting
and
yes
its
quite
drinkable
anyhow
the
flavor
is
complex
but
fairly
subtle
not
my
absolute
favourite
but
i
went
out
and
bought
it
again
immediately
after
buying
the
first
batch
overall
very
unique
with
some
interesting
complexities
that
work
together
well
being
a
product
of
scotland
share
one
with
that
special
someone
while
watching
the
original
wicker
man
and
itll
be
a
great
evening
far
from
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
recent
memory
pours
amber
decent
white
head
smells
very
sweet
maltiness
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
with
a
nice
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
some
strange
aftertaste
i
guess
its
the
heather
overall
pretty
enjoyable
and
unique
worth
trying
for
sure
drinkability
not
bad
i
actually
like
it
the
appearance
was
clear
golden
colored
thin
white
head
read
looked
like
a
standard
pilsner
the
aroma
was
pretty
funky
probably
from
the
heather
the
wort
is
soaked
in
ive
had
a
few
other
beers
with
this
smellflavor
rogue
festive
ale
comes
to
mind
the
flavors
are
all
floral
and
a
little
spicy
not
hot
spicy
kind
of
good
and
probably
authentic
for
the
style
not
my
favorite
flavor
combination
though
so
my
drinkability
score
is
lower
note
the
fact
that
this
tastes
like
beer
did
4000
years
ago
is
pretty
cool
since
it
probably
fueled
the
druids
hoisting
the
monoliths
of
stonehenge
but
while
that
makes
it
interesting
it
doesnt
make
it
good
im
pretty
sure
the
food
they
ate
back
then
was
pretty
rotgut
too
d
not
a
beer
for
everyday
drinking
but
a
good
intresting
beer
for
every
now
and
then
i
have
to
say
that
im
surprised
this
is
an
unexpectedly
delicious
ale
that
can
easily
be
enjoyed
by
itself
or
with
a
lightly
spiced
white
meat
dthis
is
a
unique
and
tasty
treat
there
is
a
slight
contrast
here
between
the
dry
malt
character
and
what
i
believe
to
be
honey
the
aftertaste
is
very
nice
here
as
no
particular
spice
overwhelms
there
is
just
a
vague
spice
character
and
residual
sweetness
that
makes
this
a
great
after
dinner
treat
not
a
bad
beer
and
one
i
would
have
again
but
one
to
drink
when
you
dont
want
to
think
about
the
beer
just
enjoy
it
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
ale
it
has
a
crisp
herbal
aroma
emanating
from
its
generous
head
when
drinking
there
is
a
bittersweet
taste
that
is
unlike
any
other
ale
i
have
tried
i
was
surprised
that
it
does
not
have
more
of
a
hoppy
flavor
it
leaves
a
sweet
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
but
i
find
it
amazing
that
there
is
no
alcoholic
aftertaste
that
i
can
detect
at
5
this
is
definitely
a
plus
i
could
see
myself
getting
very
intoxicated
while
drinking
this
beverage
since
it
goes
down
smoother
than
most
anything
else
i
have
tried
if
youre
looking
for
something
light
and
a
little
bit
different
give
this
a
try
comment
i
have
to
hand
it
to
the
marketing
department
of
heather
ale
ltd
because
they
make
one
hell
of
a
package
it
made
me
buy
a
four
pack
of
their
product
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
too
special
d
very
different
brew
refreshing
light
crisp
finish
worth
a
try
it
is
as
complex
as
any
wine
you
might
try
history
in
a
glass
light
bodied
smooth
and
very
drinkable
an
interesting
brew
that
according
to
the
label
has
been
around
since
2000
bc
12oz
bottle
from
rons
in
farmington
slightly
hazy
amberred
body
with
a
thin
film
of
offwhite
head
floral
and
fruity
in
scent
somewhat
reminiscent
of
banana
though
not
like
a
hef
tastes
fruity
floral
and
somewhat
nutty
the
nut
and
bananalike
qualities
dominate
the
flavor
though
thats
not
quite
accurate
medium
in
body
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
as
well
as
unique
not
similar
to
most
beers
ive
ever
had
but
i
could
definitely
see
drinking
this
one
again
delicious
d
a
good
easydrinking
beer
its
nice
to
see
a
brewery
brewing
these
historical
styles
to
allow
us
the
consumer
to
be
able
taste
a
beer
that
is
similar
to
what
our
ancestors
drank
very
interesting
could
be
sessionable
but
the
price
is
inconvenient
drinkability
givvus
another
willya
extremely
drinkable
most
enjoyable
if
you
dig
unusual
beer
styles
especially
ones
with
plenty
of
history
like
this
one
this
is
my
first
gruit
so
im
no
expert
but
it
would
seem
to
represent
the
style
well
ill
buy
more
next
time
i
see
it
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
it
every
day
overall
a
pleasant
foray
into
the
world
of
scottish
gruits
probably
my
favorite
within
the
style
that
ive
tried
worth
a
try
especially
for
something
thats
out
there
without
being
stupidly
overthetop
for
the
sake
of
being
extreme
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
intresting
and
very
good
the
500ml
bottle
was
labeled
best
before
1007
and
a
small
ring
of
sediment
on
the
bottle
topped
off
a
great
new
style
of
beer
this
has
been
my
first
and
only
gruit
it
is
an
intriguing
flavor
though
i
would
glady
have
it
again
the
3
price
tag
for
12
oz
is
cost
prohibitive
i
got
this
in
a
fourpack
of
historic
scottish
beers
which
was
just
too
much
for
me
to
resist
aroma
is
strong
malty
and
very
pleasant
it
pours
out
an
orangeamber
rather
than
yellowish
or
brownish
with
a
thick
head
taste
is
a
tad
thin
but
pleasantly
malty
with
a
nice
bitter
kick
a
refreshing
and
smooth
ale
i
can
see
or
rather
taste
why
it
has
lasted
for
four
millennia
fraoch
is
alright
but
it
was
a
little
pricey
but
it
is
worth
a
try
oh
yeah
at
3
50
for
11
2
oz
not
too
impressed
on
value
for
the
penny
at
all
d
honey
smooth
without
being
too
floral
or
sweet
it
lightness
and
uniqueness
give
this
beer
extra
points
here
i
have
not
tasted
a
beer
quite
like
it
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
ale
that
is
going
down
great
on
this
hot
may
evening
quite
approachable
and
interesting
i
dont
remember
the
hint
of
ginger
when
i
had
this
one
a
year
or
two
ago
but
it
or
a
very
similar
taste
is
present
and
fits
nicely
within
this
ale
well
worth
trying
its
nice
to
water
my
scottish
roots
with
more
than
just
wee
heavies
from
time
to
time
slightly
redorange
a
bit
hazy
thin
head
smelled
like
flowery
honey
almost
like
a
weak
mead
i
must
say
twas
delicious
again
honey
flowers
a
bit
of
an
herbal
bitterness
that
i
think
could
have
been
more
pronounced
to
give
some
bite
against
the
almostcloying
honey
flavors
id
try
it
again
and
id
recommend
it
to
those
who
like
it
sweet
but
ive
had
much
better
gruits
oh
when
will
tom
baker
begin
brewing
them
again
drinkability
is
good
its
a
fairly
plain
and
simple
beer
but
nice
and
quite
drinkable
pours
a
big
frothy
head
with
a
brown
to
tan
color
but
it
has
no
lacing
smell
is
floral
a
new
smell
for
me
for
sure
the
taste
is
like
flowers
with
some
earthy
tones
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
when
i
was
a
kid
and
ate
flowers
only
not
so
bitter
its
sweet
but
not
very
sweet
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
small
little
bit
of
plantlike
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
very
nice
overall
i
would
definetly
try
this
again
its
very
intriguing
poured
into
my
large
tulip
glass
with
a
rich
dark
scottish
golden
hue
yes
i
did
make
up
that
color
thanks
for
wondering
an
impressive
creamy
offwhite
head
rested
on
top
like
a
beer
induced
cloud
a
good
swirl
brings
it
right
back
to
life
midway
the
nose
was
of
sweet
malt
and
cold
biscuits
with
traces
of
clover
honey
in
the
finish
this
fantastic
malty
tasting
beer
had
a
very
low
hop
presence
as
it
finished
with
a
light
sweet
eucalyptus
like
cooling
sensation
im
guessing
a
product
of
the
heather
flower
seeing
as
though
i
havent
exactly
trampled
through
the
highlands
gnawing
on
fresh
heather
i
cant
really
be
sure
it
had
a
very
smooth
mouth
feel
with
a
medium
body
that
lent
to
easy
drinking
this
beer
pairs
very
well
with
panko
breaded
pork
cutlets
served
with
london
chop
sauce
a
firm
nutty
cheese
like
samsoe
a
danish
cheddar
or
the
semifirm
cheshire
with
its
buttery
finish
would
be
great
served
as
an
appetizerenjoy
nonexistent
head
but
did
yield
some
moderate
lacing
even
with
a
violent
pour
i
couldnt
stir
much
of
a
head
up
it
does
have
an
appealing
color
that
looks
like
a
hazy
apple
cider
the
aroma
has
a
very
earthy
smell
along
with
sweet
floral
notes
and
raisins
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
but
is
a
touch
watery
light
to
medium
bodied
it
is
very
drinkable
but
not
enough
to
become
a
session
beer
the
heather
offers
a
different
taste
as
to
what
hops
delivers
it
still
has
a
touch
of
bitterness
though
i
prefer
the
taste
of
hops
to
heather
not
a
complex
brew
but
it
is
unique
and
tasty
overall
just
about
an
all
4
good
rating
pours
a
very
clear
brilliant
amber
with
golden
highlights
frothy
bigbubbled
head
with
a
collar
that
sticks
aromas
of
honey
suckle
heather
flowers
sweet
clover
honey
and
iced
tea
minimal
malt
aroma
and
zesty
earthyspicy
bits
on
the
palate
a
sharp
floral
character
braces
things
up
followed
by
metallic
carbonation
and
a
sweet
tealeaf
midpalate
that
finishes
off
halfsweet
halfdry
and
unlike
a
conventional
beer
no
hop
oilyness
instead
just
soft
flower
oils
that
have
some
sweet
flavors
but
no
oily
heaviness
surprisingly
fullbodied
and
flavorful
and
very
unique
what
a
wonderful
beer
definitely
unique
stuff
drinkability
a
hearty
brew
but
not
too
heavy
with
a
clean
lingering
finish
of
heather
nicely
done
this
poured
from
the
11
2oz
bottle
with
a
pleasant
warm
orange
color
and
a
wellformer
white
topping
of
white
bubbles
theres
a
nice
little
flowery
aroma
that
youd
expect
from
a
beer
made
with
heather
the
flavors
are
bolder
and
brighter
than
i
might
expect
very
much
flowery
almost
mulchy
herbal

cheers
d
not
something
that
i
would
repeat
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
style
that
is
new
to
me
i
recommend
trying
this
if
available
a
weird
experience
but
worth
a
try
in
this
case
im
glad
to
have
had
this
as
a
sample
could
have
more
if
thats
all
there
was
but
following
the
2
belgians
i
just
had
im
spoiled
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
bubbly
white
head
aroma
of
honey
lots
of
grassy
grains
taste
was
honey
again
with
malty
raisins
and
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
definitely
a
creamy
smooth
plus
this
is
not
bad
at
all
and
the
history
of
this
brew
is
certainly
interesting
d
although
bottle
says
best
by
feb
2007
i
think
this
beer
is
slightly
past
its
prime
i
remember
its
scent
being
intoxicatingly
amazing
and
this
bottle
is
soso
try
it
once
especially
if
it
seems
fresh
i
e
best
by
date
is
several
months
in
future
d
one
that
every
beer
drinker
must
try
at
least
once
the
label
claims
a
heritage
for
this
style
dating
to
scotland
since
2000
b
c
thats
a
remarkably
historic
style
thats
about
as
different
as
a
beer
can
get
its
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
for
the
novelty
with
flavors
good
enough
to
have
again
drinkability
interesting
and
worth
a
try
for
the
historical
context
you
can
surely
see
why
hops
are
an
improvement
on
heather
as
a
bittering
agent
the
taste
throws
another
interesting
factor
into
the
mix
it
is
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
definately
organic
clovers
honey
and
light
malts
are
very
gentle
on
the
tongue
amazingly
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
its
a
little
too
onesided
to
keep
my
interest
12
oz
bottle
color
of
golden
orange
with
thin
white
quickly
departing
head
nose
of
malts
cobwebs
hopps
floral
and
hay

taste
of
oak

spices
earthy
mild

body
thin
and


aftertaste
of
hopps
and
short
drinkability
good
and
interesting
but
not
something
i
want
to
drink
every
night
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
decent
but
nothing
i
am
interested
in
buying
again
i
wast
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
brew
but
it
reminded
me
of
a
light
sahti
less
sweet
than
i
had
expected
it
poured
a
clean
golden
color
with
good
lacing
and
a
bubbly
white
head
some
nice
floral
notes
and
some
spice
in
the
aroma
good
herbal
flavors
with
a
hint
of
sourness
on
the
backend
aggressive
carbonation
was
my
only
complaint
but
very
refreshing
and
tasty
this
pours
a
dark
amber
with
little
head
retention
that
thins
to
some
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
bit
strong
with
a
herbal
like
malt
quality
the
heather
can
be
tastes
as
well
the
taste
somewhat
earthy
and
herby
with
a
light
quality
not
bad
but
not
that
drinkable
for
my
tastes
interesting
notes
this
was
quite
a
surprise
i
tried
this
on
a
whim
one
day
and
it
has
become
a
regular
for
my
wife
and
i
the
herbal
and
floral
aroma
and
flavor
is
so
nice
and
this
beer
is
so
drinkable
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
havent
clear
ambergold
thin
white
head
forms
settles
to
a
thin
film
some
lacing
smell
is
nice
really
grainy
sweet
herbs
chocolate
taste
is
sweet
up
front
very
nice
graininess
bready
medicinal
herbal
quality
very
malty
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
very
smooth
has
the
nice
earthy
characteristics
of
a
good
scottish
ale
like
caledonian
80
im
really
impressed
with
the
ales
from
this
brewer
consistantly
maltherbal
tasting
and
infinitely
mellow
with
a
soft
mineral
mouth
this
beer
suprised
me
as
to
how
good
it
is
a
must
try
i
can
drink
a
ton
of
this
delicious
and
zesty
pours
to
a
very
dull
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
beaks
down
quickly
and
just
leaves
a
slight
film
on
top
the
aroma
is
floral
but
not
in
a
hops
way
slightly
sweet
and
also
reminds
me
of
a
homebrew
smell
the
taste
has
an
earth
herb
taste
that
is
very
different
from
what
i
have
experienced
in
the
past
some
sweet
characteristics
as
well
mostly
caramel
like
flavors
it
has
a
very
dry
feel
in
the
mouth
this
is
an
interesting
brew
but
is
not
one
that
i
would
say
i
truly
care
for
nice
to
try
something
new
but
at
this
point
in
time
not
one
i
would
actively
look
for
in
the
future
its
an
interesting
brew
not
really
my
thing
but
a
good
brew
for
what
it
is
might
add
it
to
my
in
the
mood
for
something
different
list
d
not
a
great
fan
of
this
one
it
was
probably
served
a
bit
too
cold
perhaps
should
have
spent
more
time
letting
it
warm
will
rereview
later
but
on
this
offering
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
one
again
d
despite
my
trepidations
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
im
glad
i
bought
more
than
one
nice
hazy
orange
color
almost
without
a
head
smells
fantastic
very
floral
flowery
but
with
deep
malts
and
a
touch
of
smoke
and
honey
possesses
an
exceptional
light
body
with
medium
low
carbonation
creating
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
given
the
light
body
the
flavor
is
massive
honey
malts
with
a
very
unique
flowery
quality
that
i
will
assume
is
the
heather
somewhat
earthy
as
well
again
a
slight
smoke
aspect
typical
of
many
scottish
ales
very
well
balanced
the
heather
manages
to
contribute
bitterness
yet
it
disappears
almost
completely
from
the
palate
once
you
swallow
very
clean
crisp
finish
very
interesting
amazingly
drinkable
after
i
was
halfway
through
my
5l
in
the
first
couple
minutes
i
had
to
force
myself
to
slow
down
very
nice
beer
overall
this
is
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
without
a
huge
amount
of
complexity
to
the
taste
drinkability
high
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
the
chapin
clan
d
a
tasty
and
interesting
offering
which
is
definitely
worth
trying
d
this
is
my
second
gruit
and
i
still
dont
know
what
to
think
about
it
this
is
just
a
totally
unique
experience
i
definitely
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
but
im
anxious
to
try
as
many
different
kinds
of
this
strange
brew
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
330
ml
bottle
bought
at
mahlers
vinhandel
frederikshavn
denmark
my
first
heather
ale
cloudy
honey
coloured
moderate
head
nice
aroma
of
heather
flowers
and
heather
honey
notes
of
earth
peat
and
fresh
sea
air
too
flavour
is
earthy
and
moderately
herbal
but
not
quite
as
exciting
as
i
hoped
still
good
though
mouthfeel
is
maybe
a
bit
thin
the
beer
is
fairly
dry
but
some
heather
honey
notes
shine
through
a
moderate
herbal
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
is
much
better
than
the
other
product
of
theirs
that
ive
had
alba
scots
pine
ale
however
ill
stick
to
hops
in
my
beer
and
leave
the
heather
to
beautify
the
scottish
countryside
not
to
bad
a
little
different
but
still
enjoyable
another
unsual
and
complex
beer
from
heather
ale
something
off
the
beaten
path
but
well
woth
the
experience
11
2
oz
bottel
poured
into
and
imperial
pint
glass
i
really
like
the
label
on
this
bottle
very
medieval
looking
a
nice
bottle
just
adds
to
the
enjoyment
a
nice
foamy
head
a
little
more
than
a
finger
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
very
thick
and
sticky
lace
color
is
a
dirty
orangebrown
smell
is
very
sweet
floral
and
malt
with
earthy
notes
the
floral
flavor
is
little
overpowering
there
is
also
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
berry
included
mouthfeel
is
slightly
syrupy
and
sticky
this
is
a
very
interesting
adventure
of
a
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
too
sweet
and
im
not
big
on
the
background
flavour
that
im
assuming
is
heather
this
might
actually
be
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
it
sure
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
i
cant
even
choke
back
the
entire
bottle
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
very
low
carbonation
and
slightly
dry
in
the
finish
a
very
interesting
change
of
pace
beer
if
i
could
buy
this
by
the
case
i
probably
would
mine
came
in
a
samplerpack
id
move
on
to
something
with
a
bit
stronger
flavor
after
a
few
if
i
were
having
more
than
one
but
overall
this
is
a
very
memorable
ale
this
is
different
but
not
overly
interesting
from
a
taste
factor
still
its
a
pretty
easy
drinker
and
well
made
enough
this
beer
looked
delicious
and
smelled
very
interesting
beautiful
light
brown
in
appearance
with
some
orange
and
gold
hues
murky
with
visable
sediment
only
a
bit
of
head
formed
at
all
the
smell
was
amazingly
complex
heres
the
list
that
hit
me
in
order
flowers
vinegar
apple
pastry
honey
cider
and
cinnamon
spices
unfortunately
that
proved
to
be
my
favorite
part
the
taste
itself
did
not
suit
me
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
lacking
in
overall
flavor
it
was
somewhat
tart
and
sour
and
a
bit
watery
herbal
tastes
almost
medicinal
an
interesting
beer
to
try
but
i
didnt
finish
the
bottle
i
find
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
companion
on
a
summer
evening
drinkability
its
very
refreshing
and
different
but
the
appeal
is
something
that
wears
out
quickly
i
would
suggest
only
a
half
pint
at
most
after
which
the
novelty
wears
off
i
would
have
another
if
it
was
a
hot
day
and
came
in
half
pint
or
less
reminds
me
alot
of
cold
herbal
tea
500ml
bottle
this
time
marked
6
months
old
previously
had
it
caskconditioned
nice
somewhat
cloudy
apricotgold
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
leaves
thin
lacing
nose
is
more
straightforward
this
time
with
a
prominent
coriander
spice
floral
and
light
with
tar
bright
berries
and
a
subtle
biscuity
base
very
mild
carbonation
medium
body
rolls
on
the
tongue
pleasantly
the
floral
sweetness
is
interesting
herbal
and
citrusy
goes
down
smooth
finishing
dry
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
drinks
like
a
tea
soothing
and
relaxing
easily
quaffable
and
enjoyable
drinkability
goes
down
with
some
effort
was
nice
to
try
this
ancient
style
but
thats
it
dont
want
another
one
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time
but
good
to
try
there
are
better
beers
from
this
brewery
an
interesting
style
you
can
really
taste
the
heather
in
this
beer
while
a
well
made
beer
i
dont
think
its
really
my
style
but
hey
at
least
i
tried
something
new
today
overall
impression
brewed
in
scotland
since
2000
b
c
heather
ale
is
probably
the
oldest
style
of
ale
still
produced
in
the
world
the
heather
flower
also
know
as
heather
tips
impart
a
pleasing
aroma
and
smooth
bitterness
to
beers
with
the
flavor
similar
to
a
chamomilemint
blend
with
hot
lavender
heather
pairs
well
with
honey
it
is
also
great
for
tea
with
reputed
calming
qualities
this
beer
definitely
has
a
distinct
flavor
with
the
use
of
heather
tips
instead
of
hops
very
smooth
and
refreshing
pours
a
cloudy
straw
hue
with
fluffy
one
finger
buttermilk
head
and
mild
carbonation
lemony
floral
nose
with
hints
of
coriander
maybe
cinnamon
very
floral
taste
with
cinnamony
finish
a
little
hop
presence
buried
deep
in
the
mix
well
blended
mouthfeel
is
of
medium
density
with
light
carbonation
i
got
a
strange
burning
sensation
on
my
lips
although
i
couldnt
tell
whether
that
was
coming
from
the
beer
or
some
other
factor
i
wasnt
eating
at
the
time
so
aside
from
the
glass
i
was
using
im
not
sure
where
else
this
could
have
come
from
i
could
see
this
making
a
good
session
beer
not
too
strong
either
tastewise
or
in
terms
of
alcohol
content
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
this
one
out
but
ive
had
a
lot
worse
thanks
to
ostevela
for
the
bottle
i
think
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
i
like
a
beer
with
a
little
more
flavor
to
it
but
i
think
this
is
a
nice
one
to
put
down
with
a
fresh
palate
this
doesnt
seem
sweet
at
all
even
though
there
is
some
underlying
honey
flavour
to
it
heather
is
dominant
though
doing
the
work
one
normally
expects
of
hops
and
producing
a
complexity
of
flavour
comparable
to
some
of
the
better
hops
used
for
potent
ipas
but
distinctively
different
unfortunately
im
not
really
up
to
the
task
of
describing
it
there
is
a
rather
oily
feel
on
the
tongue
and
a
pine
sap
aftertaste
which
i
quite
appreciate
pours
out
a
hazy
rusty
orange
with
a
weak
head
smells
lightly
of
bready
biscuity
malts
with
a
humongous
perfumey
heather
aroma
almost
smells
a
bit
minty
and
berrylike
some
yeast
in
the
nose
as
well
flavor
is
big
on
the
heather
and
berries
with
a
light
malt
backbone
the
malt
really
seems
to
take
a
back
seat
to
the
flavoring
but
that
seems
to
work
out
just
fine
here
flavors
thin
out
a
bit
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
and
prickly
with
bubbles
this
drinks
way
too
fast

this
ale
is
not
just
of
interest
to
antiquarians
as
it
can
hold
its
own
as
a
tasty
brew
whatever
millennium
it
is
wellbalanced
despite
its
lack
of
hops
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
the
pictish
label
art
kicks
arse
too
its
alright
in
my
book
light
but
not
exactly
easy
drinking
i
think
one
sampling
was
enough
unless
im
drinking
local
the
beer
pours
golden
and
cloudy
like
a
wheatbeer
with
a
brighter
yellow
the
head
is
thin
virtually
no
head
the
look
is
interesting
reminiscent
of
a
bottle
conditioned
beer
smells
of
flowers
with
a
deep
roasted
honey
beneath
very
easy
drinking
like
a
lightly
sweetened
water
with
a
slight
tartness
and
a
firm
tart
aftertaste
that
lingers
gently
feels
like
an
instant
lemonade
slight
oiliness
gives
away
the
alcohol
and
particulates
very
drinkable
if
cost
were
not
an
isuue
it
would
be
an
easy
choice
for
an
all
day
drinking
beer
this
was
one
of
my
contributions
to
the
february
meeting
of
the
michana
coalition
of
the
drinking
bottle
says
best
before
october
2004
so
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
poured
cloudy

no
head
lots
of
sediment
nose
is
orangey
flowery
smells
like
an
herbal
tea
flowery
taste
orange
flavor
some
maltiness
interesting
and
not
like
any
other
beer
ive
tasted
almost
totally
flat
which
may
boil
down
to
the
expiration
date
issue
too
strange
to
really
be
drinkable
relatively
light
and
smooth
body
with
fuzzy
carbonation
intriguing
interesting
brew
but
i
wont
likely
buy
it
again
uf
but
man
i
do
still
love
hops
in
my
beer
d
easily
approachable
but
it
doesnt
really
bring
me
back
for
more
poured
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
medium
size
white
that
left
some
lacing
aroma
is
yeastysweet
and
hints
of
honey
flavor
fruity
spices
with
a
taste
of
honey
this
a
differant
beer
at
1st
i
didnt
care
for
it
as
it
warmed
up
i
started
to
get
in
to
it
this
beer
has
a
ton
of
floaters
the
color
is
a
cloudy
light
orange
the
smell
is
sweet
reminds
me
of
honeysuckle
the
taste
is
somewhat
citrus
like
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
no
bite
or
negative
aftertaste
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
i
like
this
much
better
than
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
could
drink
it
again
sometime
all
in
all
a
good
beer
easy
to
drink
and
something
unique
would
be
good
as
a
session
brew
this
beer
smells
and
tastes
of
apples
it
is
a
refreshing
and
quenching
beer
with
a
green
apple
nose
start
and
finish
i
like
it
alot
and
should
keep
some
around
for
the
times
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
something
fruity
there
is
some
bread
and
cinnamon
in
the
nose
as
well
as
the
taste
the
spiciness
is
like
a
chilled
slightly
spicedmulled
cider
not
overpowering
just
pleasantly
there
in
the
back
very
light
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
once
you
get
past
the
interesting
and
different
taste
drinkability
goes
down
easy
had
with
some
stilton
and
salami
the
cheese
was
to
rich
and
overpowering
but
the
salami
added
a
much
appreciated
spice
to
the
beer
interesting
change
of
pace
that
refreshes
and
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
wonder
if
this
what
william
wallace
was
chugging
back
in
the
day
overall
an
excellent
beer
recommended
i
had
never
before
tried
a
heather
ale
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
the
beer
has
a
pale
browngold
color
did
not
have
much
of
a
head
it
has
a
unique
mellow
flavor
something
that
can
obviously
be
attributed
to
the
use
of
heather
flowers
though
an
ale
the
familiar
ale
bitterness
is
very
muted
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
and
is
recommended
for
anyone
who
wants
to
try
a
new
style
of
ale
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
awhile
but
waited
until
i
could
find
a
place
where
i
could
mix
it
into
a
six
pack
330
ml
bottle
with
best
by
april

notched
on
the
back
pours
a
bright
and
radiant
unfiltered
orangegold
with
one
finger
of
white
head
that
leaves
some
wisps
of
lace
smells
flowery
roses
probably
heather
with
a
light
honey
aroma
sweet
malts
and
spices
ginger
orange
tea
mint
it
has
a
fairly
strong
aroma
and
a
medium
to
full
body
that
is
smooth
yet
tingly
and
evenly
coats
the
palate
it
tastes
malty
with
the
same
flowerspice
profile
a
low
bitterness
and
maybe
some
nuttiness
has
a
fairly
high
drinkability
as
i
went
through
the
bottle
fairly
quickly
and
wished
i
had
another
both
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
unique
one
that
makes
for
a
good
change
of
pace
will
buy
this
one
again
im
going
to
have
to
try
this
beer
again
to
decide
how
much
i
like
it
but
after
one
tasting
i
can
say
that
i
really
appreciate
its
distinctiveness
and
theres
no
doubt
that
it
has
a
lot
of
desirable
qualities
pours
a
hazey
dark
copper
color
with
little
head
smell
is
very
slight
with
hints
of
honey
and
flowers
the
flavor
starts
out
with
bready
maltness
and
fades
to
a
kind
of
floral
honey
flavor
when
i
first
saw
this
brew
i
thought
it
was
a
gimmick
i
was
very
wrong
this
is
a
very
good
ale
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
will
be
picking
this
one
up
again
not
really
sure
what
to
give
on
drinkability
id
have
another
but
after
that
the
uniqueness
suggests
trying
something
else
maybe
the
kelpie
offering
by
the
same
label
intriguing
overall
i
was
more
impressed
with
the
nose
than
the
taste
but
its
still
a
good
beer
have
access
to
four
packs
of
fraoch
or
a
mixed
four
pack
with
other
heather
ale
beers
and
although
this
is
my
least
favorite
i
certainly
dont
object
to
it
and
would
gladly
drink
it
again
pourde
a
slightly
hazy
deep
peach
color
with
offwhite
head
smnell
is
earthy
dark
fruity
sweetish
toasty
and
very
enjoyable
taste
can
only
be
described
as
very
herbal
seems
to
have
characteristcis
of
herbal
teas
ive
had
in
the
past
alsp
seems
to
taste
of
flowers
in
a
pleasant
way
finishes
with
a
slight
dryness
and
more
flowery
notes
a
very
different
beer
than
any
ive
had
before
very
pleasant
i
am
going
to
have
to
say
that
this
is
tied
as
my
favourite
beer
of
its
style
light
but
keeps
its
malt
roots
highly
recommended
another
great
ale
by
heather
what
an
interesting
brewery
this
one
is
the
perfect
session
ale
i
have
no
idea
what
the
abv
is
but
i
could
feel
it
when
finished
dont
know
much
about
heather
ales
but
i
have
to
believe
this
is
one
of
the
best
you
should
try
this
beer
malty
aroma
rises
from
freshly
opened
bottle
pours
a
deep
orange
with
very
little
head
what
head
there
is
has
soapy
look
the
aroma
has
slight
floral
tones
with
hints
of
heather
no
suprise
since
fraoch
is
gaelic
for
heather
and
this
ale
is
made
using
traditional
techniques
and
flavored
with
the
flower
of
the
heather
plant
the
flavor
is
very
malty
with
no
strong
bitterness
at
the
front
but
it
does
coat
the
tongue
with
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
malty
sweetness
stays
on
the
palate
long
after
finishing
the
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
for
anyone
who
enjoys
malty
beers
not
particularly
drinkable
i
guess
this
just
isnt
my
style
when
it
comes
to
scottish
ales
ill
stick
to
the
wee
heavy
this
one
was
the
most
popular
brew
served
at
the
world
beer
festival
speaking
engagement
featuring
british
ales
by
the
end
of
the
session
all
of
the
labels
had
been
ripped
off
and
tucked
away
in
drinkers
pockets
to
bring
home
ive
never
seen
something
so
popular
great
new
style
which
i
would
love
to
get
to
know
more
about
howeevr
the
prospects
arent
so
good
pete
brown
from
all
about
beer
magazine
explained
to
us
the
history
here
and
would
really
be
interested
in
trying
out
more
ancient
ales
pours
a
golden
amber
with
very
little
head
earthy
aroma
with
a
little
citrus
a
very
smooth
taste
with
just
a
little
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
does
not
linger
too
long
on
the
palate
as
it
warmed
up
to
near
room
temperature
the
taste
improved
dramatically
i
consider
this
a
must
try
due
to
its
history
and
uniqueness
after
that
you
can
deicide
for
yourself
if
youd
drink
again
i
will
if
this
beer
is
available
in
your
area
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
the
taste
wont
change
your
life
but
its
different
enough
to
make
it
worth
a
trip
to
the
store
add
on
edit
another
reviewer
said
it
was
like
chewing
on
rose
petals
that
hits
it
right
on
the
head
let
me
begin
by
saying
this
is
absolutely
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
tried
before
i
poured
a
pale
bronze
orange
colour
with
zero
head
only
a
negligible
amount
of
thin
lace
ring
the
smell
reminds
me
of
hops
and
oatmeal
dry
oatmeal
a
good
bit
of
malt
as
well
as
a
faintly
noticeable
grassy
herb
undertone
toward
the
finish
strange
pleasant
but
strange
the
taste
is
fantastic
great
malty
taste
will
herbs
present
there
too
i
hate
to
be
so
vague
but
this
is
really
unusual
stuff
and
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
it
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
thin
but
i
believe
if
it
were
heavier
it
would
be
offensive
overall
very
unusual
but
very
pleasant
brew
glad
i
gave
it
a
go
the
beer
pours
a
dark
gold
color
with
12
white
head
that
fades
to
spotty
lacing
there
are
plenty
of
floaties
present
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
mild
pale
malt
scent
along
with
floral
hints
and
fruitiness
it
s
herbal
smelling
with
a
tart
edge
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
an
earthy
flavor
that
boasts
of
herbs
and
floral
hints
pale
malts
act
as
the
base
but
the
herbs
offer
most
of
the
flavor
it
seems
a
bit
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
gruit
but
ive
had
better
it
has
a
nice
aroma
so
your
curiosity
and
your
tongue
and
your
nose
will
be
pleased
what
more
could
you
ask
for
i
like
some
other
mention
that
this
one
really
is
better
when
sat
out
for
awhile
so
that
the
smell
and
taste
can
be
more
subsetiable
but
coming
from
scotland
i
would
of
thought
that
it
be
a
bit
stronger
than
what
it
was
here
slainte
beertracker
a
pleasant
break
from
hoppier
and
bigger
bodied
beers

its

suprisingly
good

slight

flavors
of

like

heather
tips
make
me
feel

very

dvery
interesting
beer
it
is
very
subtle
in
flavors
but
does
have
a
nice
complexity
it
would
really
benefit
from
more
carbonation
but
the
malts
work
well
with
the
heather
dated

a

nice
carbonation
with
a
small

not
much
lacing
afterwards
hoppy
floral
scents
kinda
sweet
very
unique
in
scent
and
taste
i
guess
its
the
heather
sweet
taste
with
a
little
bite
at
the
end
light
body
this
would
make
a
great
session
brew
because
of
the
alcohol
content
and
drinkability
of
the
brew
itself
i
highly
recommend
it
at
least
once
in
your
lifetime
i
really
didnt
know
what
this
was
when
i
bought
it
and
i
wouldnt
have
imagined
a
scottish
beer
to
be
this
light
and
subtle
pours
a
light
golden
hue
smells
and
tastes
flowery
and
light
a
nice
little
bite
and
aftertaste
is
there
and
there
isnt
anything
bad
about
this
beer
these
days
im
really
not
into
light
and
delicate
brews
for
those
who
are
this
is
a
nice
one
unique
heather
ale
is
a
keeper
having
said
that
the
aroma
could
be
more
compelling
and
the
flavor
more
uh
flavorful
these
guys
brew
some
interesting
concoctions
and
deserve
praise
for
brewing
outside
the
box
occasionally
waaay
outside
the
box
the
price

reads

while
it
isnt
quite
worth
that
im
not
sorry
that
i
had
the
good
sense
to
try
this
offbeat
gruit
this
is
a
good
brew
i
may
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
again
but
id
certainly
not
turn
one
down
were
it
offered
to
me
pours
a
pond
water
green
color
very
mucky
there
is
no

is
mildy
sweet
and
watery
not
much
is
going
on
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
bodied
and

with
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
weird
brew
perhaps
im
not
enjoying
it
as
much
as
i
could
be
but
i
miss
the
hops
still
it
is
pretty
refreshing
and
inoffensive
light
head
with
a
golden
color
no
real
lace
on
the
glass
very
floral
aroma
and
slight
malt
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
malty
with
no
real
bitterness
but
a
strong
floral
aroma
its
almost
like
a
bitter
with
no
bittering
hops
only
finishing
the
taste
is
smooth
but
not
terribly
satisfying
definitely
drinkable
its
a
nice
pint
for
historical
reasons
id
be
interested
in
finding
out
what
a
fresh
sample
would
entail
this
bottle
made
enough
of
an
impression
for
me
to
keep
an
eye
out
overall
i
would
highly
recommend

this
is
very
drinkable
and
probably
nice
to
have
around
to
surprise
guests
or
for
a
change

not
as

the

light

i
think
this
is
a

i

i
would

it

that

54it
is
very
malty
tasting
so
sweetness
seems
balanced
by
heather
giving
it
grassy
notes
and
the
dry
finish
as
advertised
plus
a
very
faint
citrusy
aspect
wellmade
relic
of
those
days
of
auld
lang
syne
pours
an
almost
clear
orange
amber
color
with
a
shortlived
white
head
that
leaves
a
delicate
ring
of
lacing
nose
has
a
floral
bouquet
with
sweet
malts
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
is
not
surprisingly
unusual
but
quite
pleasant
the
heather
bitters
the
toffeecaramel
malt
characters
very
well
resulting
in
a
nicely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
ale
if
this
is
what
the
scots
drank
2000
years
ago
then
they
drank
quite
well
this
is
a
really
interesting
concept
for
an
ale
which
i
clasped
onto
immediately
pours
a
bubbly
copper
color
with
a
very
thin
lace
on
the
goblet
the
malty
aroma
has
tones
of
floral
heather
the
ale
is
very
smooth
and
malty
with
a
woven
heather
floral
touch
throughout
the
body
is
refreshing
with
a
moderate
bitterness
entirely
wellbalanced
and
easy
on
the
senses
pours
with
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
minimal
head
even
after
a
vigorous
pour
aroma
is
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
a
very
floral
aroma
from
the
heather
this
is
brewed
with
heather
in
place
of
the
hops
this
really
needs
some
bitterness
though
i
has
sweetness
and
the
tangy
heather
flavor
but
in
my
opinion
i
really
miss
the
hops
nice
looking
brew
when
poured
decent
frothy
offwhite
head
that
reduces
to
a
lace
of
tiny
bubbles
clear
golden
amber
color
floral
aroma
that
is
hoppy
but
then
again
not
quite
hoppy
interesting
use
of
something
other
then
hops
as
a
bittering
agent
from
what
ive
read
elsewhere
there
are
no
hops
used
in
the
brewing
of
this
ale
just
heather
only
a
hint
of
malt
in
the
aroma
smooth
brew
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
light
carbonation
light
bready
malt
notes
with
only
a
light
sweetness
the
finish
has
a
mild
bitterness
that
balances
out
the
brew
rather
nicely
due
to
the
lack
of
hops
however
the
bitterness
is
unique
to
this
brew
the
bottle
says
it
has
a
dry
winey
finish
i
didnt
observe
this
in
the
bottle
i
sampled
this
was
a
good
drinkable
brew
but
did
not
stand
out
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
definitely
worth
a
try
though
overall
this
beer
is
unique
and
interesting
definitely
something
you
should
give
a
try
but
not
one
ill
be
looking
for
again
anytime
soon
not
a
session
brew
but
acceptable
thx
great
brew
highly
recommended
medium
body
crisp
and
a
bit
tingly
on
the
tongue
nice
spices
dominate
it
is
floral
and
a
bit
earthy
it
is
not
as
intensly
flavored
as
some
other
herbspiced
beers
but
it
is
definitely
not
lacking
flavor
some
citrus
notes
here
and
there
and
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
round
it
out
it
is
very
drinkable
and
even
though
it
is
dry
you
could
sit
down
with
more
than
one
my
mouth
is
sucked
free
of
fluid
at
the
end
of
a
sip
and
a
nice
smoky
flavor
lingers
ave
a
bit
sweet
up
front
with
some
bready
flavours
it
then
goes
very
dry
and
transitions
into
apples
herbs
quite
unique
medium
bodied
in
the
mount
but
somehow
stays
heavy
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
a
mild
noise
is
following
a
strong
head
that
lingers
to
almost
stick
to
the
side
of
the
glass
a
slightly
heavy
body
is
followed
by
a
spicy
fruity
taste
with
a
whiny
finish
and
faint
aftertaste
that
that
just
melts
away
interesting
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
and
has
very
little
head
or
carbonation
the
aroma
is
grassy
and
maybe
a
little
floral
tastes
like
weeds
heather
not
too
great
of
a
taste
interesting
yes
but
not
very
good
the
drinkability
was
notsogood
and
the
mouth
feel
was
about
average
pours
a
dull
cloudy
reddishearth
color
nice
thick
head
that
falls
a
little
too
quickly
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
flowerysweetness
and
fleeting
hops
the
taste
is
really
remarkable
its
a
mix
of
fruity
sweetness
and
maltiness
as
well
as
a
dry
tangy
flavor
the
finish
is
often
marked
with
a
powdery
astringent
sensation
surprisingly
drinkable
and
very
interesting
notes
ive
also
had
this
served
from
a
bottle
and
just
had
to
try
it
as
a
caskconditioned
ale
it
has
been
awhile
since
i
had
the
bottled
version
but
i
recall
the
malt
flavor
being
a
bit
more
prominent
the
aromas
and
flavors
of
the
heather
are
a
bit
stronger
in
the
caskconditioned
version
you
could
probably
approximate
the
flavor
by
pouring
the
beer
into
a
glass
and
leaving
it
in
your
fridge
overnight
a
very
nice
looking
brew
that
is
a
clear
deep
amber
with
heavy
hues
of
orange
the
head
is
slightly
off
white
and
fairly
minimal
but
it
does
manage
to
leave
a
continual
lace
from
the
residual
this
is
clearly
a
very
complex
ale
that
provides
many
different
sensory
opportunities
ranging
from
its
earthy
sense
to
the
elegant
spice
notes
and
onward
to
the
very
malty
and
caramel
dominance
the
flavor
is
quite
sweet
with
the
underlying
hops
doing
little
to
disturb
the
malty
sweetness
very
smooth
feel
with
little
bite
or
crispness
to
the
finish
faint
hints
of
the
heather
drift
through
the
brew
which
begins
to
weaken
on
feel
as
the
brew
warms
toward
room
temps
this
is
very
enjoyable
beer
to
be
savored
singularly
on
an
ocassional
basis
overall
along
with
the
scots
alba
pine
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
heather
ales
its
even
better
on
cask
at
3
99
for
a
halflitre
in
the
bottle
it
is
rather
expensive
but
well
worth
treating
yourself
to
one
if
you
have
yet
to
try
it
deep
golden
with
low
retention
nice
big
floralhop
aroma
babysbreath
flavor
is
sweet
and
floral
with
good
hops
and
sweet
malts
a
most
interesting
flavor
earthy
woodsy
and
sweet
body
is
a
bit
light
but
interesting
blends
make
up
for
that
shortcoming
not
one
id
drink
often
but
id
love
to
try
it
on
draught
this
brew
poured
a
small
sized
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
off
white
bubbles
it
has
a
cloudy
amber
brown
body
with
some
carbonation
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
it
had
a
smooth
malty
initial
taste
with
some
but
not
much
tang
to
the
finish
it
was
very
smooth
with
a
good
full
bodied
flavor
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
with
the
pagan
label
it
pours
a
very
nice
looking
gold
thats
just
a
bit
hazy
the
white
head
is
initially
thin
and
then
disappears
almost
immediately
the
smell
is
a
very
pleasant
flowerherb
with
a
hint
of
medicine
and
a
nice
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
most
noticeably
herbal
it
has
a
dry
finish
and
is
really
very
smooth
it
certainly
is
a
nice
change
from
hops
but
not
an
everyday
beer
very
aromatic
beer
with
a
lot
of
spice
in
the
nose
and
a
hint
of
smoke
spcies
come
through
in
the
mouth
and
leave
a
biting
finish
a
mintlike
flavor
was
perceived
in
the
flavor
after
a
while
found
this
one
to
be
a
bit
astringent
and
couldnt
get
past
it
aftertaste
was
not
so
pleasant
hops
were
not
present
at
all
after
having
been
impressed
with
the
two
other
beers
ive
sampled
from
this
brewery
the
fraoch
was
a
letdown
for
a
beer
that
touts
itself
as
being
brewed
with
heather
i
really
expected
quite
a
bit
of
floral
notes
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
the
heather
seemed
to
lend
more
of
a
stodgy
herbal
flavor
quite
typical
of
scottish
ale
in
the
malt
which
was
substantial
but
overall
bland
the
heather
never
did
anything
to
liven
the
beer
and
my
overall
impression
was
blah
not
bad
just
boring
pours
a
golden
light
amber
color
with
some
black
pieces
of
sediment
that
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
nectar
honey
and
flowers
with
a
touch
of
smoky
peat
the
taste
is
complex
being
full
in
flavor
and
yet
also
delicate
at
the
same
time
with
notes
of
spicy
herbs
honey
fruit
dry
malts
and
dry
white
wine
a
grand
brew
and
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
have
sampled
a
musttry
for
anyone
thanks
to
loki
for
the
sample
came
in
a
500ml
brown
bottle
with
freshness

great

nice
big
foamy

good

the
smell
is
fantastic
berries
flowers
a
little
bit
of
grass
very
sweet
flavour
is
sweet
and
flowery
some
hay
a
crisp
aftertaste
but
not
too
dry
something
you
could
sip
on
all
day
especially
in
the
great
outdoors
in
the
sun
hazy
orangishyellow
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
the
malty
fruity
and
floral
it
also
has
an
interesting
aroma
i
am
sure
which
is
the
heather
i
have
never
smelt
heather
before
let
alone
in
a
beer
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
fragrant
beer
the
flavor
is
malty
floral
and
grassy
it
is
a
very
smooth
easy
drinking
lightmedium
bodied
beer
an
interesting
beer
with
a
unique
flavor
and
aroma
thanks
loki
for
my
first
heather
ale
i
loved
it
my
first
heather
ale
great
floral
nose
as
youd
expect
very
unique
also
some
sweet
maltiness
on
the
nose
pours
an
orange
tinted
gold
cloudy
no
head
or
lace
as
you
drink
body
is
medium
firm
enough
big
floral
flavor
combines
with
a
zesty
spiciness
the
sweet
malt
is
there
as
well
and
adds
a
nice
dimension
a
real
interesting
beer
to
taste
not
one
id
be
able
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
love
unique
beers
and
to
me
this
is
pretty
unique
the
mouth
feel
is
very
crisp
and
clean
and
goes
down
very
easily
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
would
make
for
interesting
food
parings
i
think
ill
have
another
allinall
fraoch
is
a
good
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
lot
and
it
is
quite
interesting
but
its
more
interesting
than
it
is
tasty
this
does
not
mean
its
bad
it
doesnt
mean
i
will
never
want
another
what
it
does
mean
to
me
is
that
this
beer
has
an
element
that
many
others
do
not
have
along
with
appearance
aroma
taste
etc
fraoch
has
history
and
that
gets
high
marks
from
me
i
was
not
totally
impressed
by
this
particular
brew
it
poured
a
medium
head
and
it
did
leave
a
good
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
mug
to
me
it
had
a
fruity
citrusy
aroma
to
it
in
my
opinion
it
had
a
bitter
taste
to
it
and
i
noticed
it
had
an
aftertaste
it
also
had
a
cloudy
appearance
overall
i
find
this
beer
to
be
quite
decent
the
herbal
flavours
are
interesting
and
its
easy
drinking
pours
clear
medium
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
slowly
dimishes
to
a
good
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
flowery
grassy
like
a
spring
day
flavor
is
clean
spicy
sweet
flowery
hints
of
rosemary
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
started
to
come
through
about
midway
body
is
medium
ends
dry
lingering
flavor
this
ale
poured
a
hazy
goldenorangish
color
with
creamy
white
foam
the
smell
was
very
nice
sweet
malty
flowery
with
yeast
and
citrus
aromas
too
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
honeylike
lightly
flowery
with
some
citrus
and
a
slight
bitterness
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
this
ale
was
extremely
drinkable
i
was
very
impressed
and
suprised
i
had
seen
this
in
the
store
many
times
but
for
some
reason
was
turned
off
by
the
thought
of
heather
in
a
beer
but
wow
was
i
sorely
mistaken
this
is
one
fine
ale
this
beer
came
in
a
non
standard
size
bottle
but
it
had
a
very
cool
label
with
celtic
designs
fraoch
pours
a
pale
ale
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
the
taste
is
mostly
of
herbal
tea
the
heather
i
suppose
but
there
is
also
some
beer
under
there
the
malt
that
comes
through
tastes
like
your
average
low
end
pale
ale
so
its
a
good
thing
that
only
a
little
comes
through
the
herbal
tones
of
this
ale
is
what
makes
it
good
complex
earthy
and
almost
honeylike
flavors
nip
at
your
tounge
like
hops
heather
has
a
mild
sedative
effect
so
it
is
a
good
herb
for
beer
this
is
definatly
an
ale
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
pat
the
taste
was
remarkably
good
and
it
went
down
smooth
leaving
little
on
the
palette
after
the
fact
i
highly
appreciate
this
one
and
look
forward
to
having
it
again
feels
good
in
the
mouth
not
too
much
carbonation
and
is
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
the
finish
is
not
long
and
a
bit
sharp
which
keeps
the
malt
from
being
overwhelming
its
not
an
overlycomplex
brew
but
it
is
wellbalanced
and
very
quaffable
a
very
good
session
beer
the
taste
is
so
light
sweet
and
utterly
ethereal
this
belongs
in
a
class
of
its
own
lovely
full
texture
honey
citrus
shining
through
with
every
sip
perfect
with
food
dessert
or
when
you
deserve
a
reward
for
being
an
exceptional
example
of
humankind
this
scottish
ale
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
its
very
refreshing
and
i
will
definitely
be
a
repeat
buyer
of
it
i
really
liked
this
huge
beer
i
say
huge
cause
i
got
it
in
a
bottle
that
was
like
a
22oz
or
bigger
i
saw
on
their
website
the
history
of
the
beer
and
what
it
was
all
about
so
that
turned
me
on
too
i
liked
the
smooth
fruity
taste
that
it
embowed
plus
the
almost
pinelike
taste
too
the
finish
was
good
and
easy
to
swallow
so
it
wasnt
harsh
on
the
buds
the
pour
is
a
pellucid
deep
orange
or
amber
if
you
so
desire
with
a
creamy
beige
head
that
is
average
in
size
the
lace
is
decent
and
clinging
nose
is
earthy
heather
peat
or
smoke
tones
also
present
front
somewhat
sweet
the
top
skimpy
finish
is
sparingly
carbonated
dry
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
a
different
taste
not
unpleasant
but
i
miss
the
hops
and
the
bite
but
still
for
something
different
give
it
a
try
golden
coloring
with
a
thick
white
head
medium
carbonation
has
a
fruity
and
believe
it
or
not
a
kind
of
beef
stewbouillon
aroma
as
well
has
a
flowerpetaly
flavor
herbal
and
spicy
also
has
a
tendency
to
dry
the
mouth
out
not
bad
unique
in
its
way
tastes
well
made
and
its
drinkable
for
what
it
is
but
its
not
something
id
go
back
to
with
any
frequency
nice
to
taste
something
so
different
though
kudos
to
heather
ale
ltd
for
reviving
an
ancient
style
this
is
my
kind
of
beer
fraoch
pours
out
a
deep
golden
colour
with
very
little
head
the
nose
is
pleasantly
floral
and
herby
taste
is
also
herby
i
admit
to
no
knowledge
of
the
flavour
of
heather
but
the
taste
i
got
from
this
beer
was
similar
to
rosemary
the
flavour
wasnt
too
strong
but
was
well
equipped
for
the
strength
of
the
beers
own
flavour
not
too
heavy
a
feel
in
the
mouth
and
went
down
smoothly
only
loses
marks
tor
the
lack
of
head
pleasant
all
around
but
not
hugely
memorable
if
they
were
drinking
this
good
4000
yrs
ago
wow
what
an
interesting
beer
hazy
golden
copper
with
thin
lace
which
has
large
bubbles
resting
on
it
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
spice
flavor
begins
with
some
grainy
flavor
with
a
spicy
herbal
tealike
finish
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
with
an
alcoholic
warming
effect
medium
body
with
some
prickly
carbonation
the
history
of
this
beer
alone
makes
it
worth
a
try
a
very
good
change
of
pace
it
is
times
like
this
when
i
regret
having
to
give
a
beer
a
score
every
beer
has
a
time
and
place
though
the
flavors
may
be
alien
we
really
need
to
consider
giving
it
a
grade
appropriate
for
the
style
and
resist
the
temptations
to
contrast
it
with
other
styles
the
smell
is
floreal
and
herbaceous
the
taste
is
different
than
the
smell
lets
think
its
sweet
but
not
sickly
it
has
a
very
equlibrated
taste
with
honey
in
the
smell
i
noted
the
absence
of
hop
and
its
strange
than
without
it
this
beer
appear
very
equilibrated
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
in
hue
topped
by
a
thin
but
tight
layer
that
leaves
loose
lace
pungently
floral
and
spicy
aroma
from
a
combination
of
kent
goldings
hops
and
heather
accompanied
by
lightly
tart
esters
dry
bready
malt
and
light
caramel
sweetness
a
combination
of
mild
hop
and
dried
heather
petal
bitterness
is
perceptible
at
first
but
dry
biscuit
and
bread
notes
quickly
assert
themselves
and
diminish
both
light
caramel
and
residual
sweetness
hop
flavor
is
meager
and
masked
by
the
spicy
heather
flavor
the
light
body
and
mild
overall
malt
profile
allows
the
flavors
of
heather
and
biscuit
to
dominate
in
a
pleasant
manner
that
helps
with
the
drinkability
finishes
very
dry
w
lingering
toasty
malt
notes
fraoch
is
an
unusual
brew
the
heather
petals
added
both
a
bitterness
and
flavor
that
provided
uniqueness
to
this
otherwise
unremarkable
beer
i
could
see
this
beer
becoming
cloying
after
more
than
two
however
truely
a
unique
brew
fraoch
pours
into
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
herbs
and
spices
flow
up
to
the
nose
as
if
to
invite
you
to
drink
this
incredible
brew
one
taste
of
this
and
you
are
hooked
this
is
the
easiest
of
the
heather
ales
to
get
in
my
area
it
pours
out
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
a
nice
hops
aroma
to
it
and
other
aromas
that
might
be
the
heather
intesting
body
to
it
slightly
fizzy
due
to
the
clearly
evident
higher
level
of
carbination
seems
a
bit
cloudy
but
it
may
be
due
to
that
slight
golden
in
color
nice
floral
noseand
a
little
malty
decent
head
the
taste
of
this
is
like
no
other
that
i
have
ever
hadvery
drinkable
if
it
wasnt
about
4
bucks
a
bottle
i
wish
other
people
would
try
this
style
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
very
malty
the
heather
flowers
apparently
arent
very
bitter
but
they
do
lend
a
very
subtle
floral
quality
to
the
taste
id
be
willing
to
drink
this
again
i
think
very
interesting
beer
it
was
a
surprising
find
i
just
happened
upon
it
at
a
liquor
store
i
frenquent
and
there
was
one
bottle
sitting
there
i
had
never
seen
it
before
slightly
hazed
with
a
thin
white
lace
nice
use
of
the
heather
perhaps
a
bit
over
carbonated
for
my
liking
the
sweet
heather
flavour
plays
well
of
the
dry
malt
character
best
before
date
of
dec
2001
real
interesting
old
recipe
heather

or
supplement
the

small

that
stays
around
for
a
minute
musty
winey

a
little

maybe
impressive
mouthfeel
a
little

interesting
flavor
with

yeastyfruityflowery
impression
the
smell
works
well
with
the
taste
on
a
deep
drink
beer
is
a
little
on
the
sticky
side
though
are
heather
flowers
related
to
hops
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
its
not
something
i
want
to
have
when
i
kick
back
a
put
down
a
few
pints
its
got
a
nice
cloudy
ambercolored
body
with
a
thick
head
that
quickly
fades
the
aroma
is
a
bit
thin
but
spicy
a
bit
like
the
scent
of
a
forest
the
taste
is
what
truly
sets
this
beer
apart
the
herbal
taste
dominates
sage
comes
to
mind
and
has
a
very
dry
finish
i
had
heard
about
this
aleand
saw
it
at
the
local
specialty
store
was
pleasantly
suprised
didnt
like
the
smell
but
had
a
nice
fresh
flavornever
had
a
beer
with
that
kinda
flowerylike
tastebest
way
i
could
describe
it
wierd
tasting
but
interesting
and
tasty
i
dont
know
if
this
would
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
but
it
really
is
a
good
beer
interesting
upon
first
taste
i
really
liked
this
beer
unique
and
interesting
but
very
drinkable
smelled
of
woods
and
bark
which
i
guess
is
what
this
beer
is
know
for
has
a
winey
flavor
as
well
i
am
not
sure
if
this
goes
with
any
food
except
maybe
cheese
great
beer
hops
or
no
hops
light
malt
up
front
and
a
beautiful
floral
aroma
a
must
try
notes
for
its
uniqueness
we
highly
recommend
this
ale
as
a
beer
it
is
remarkable
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
fraoch
is
gaelic
for
heather
this
is
one
of
the
oldest
ale
styles
brewed
in
history
from
heather
flowers
and
scottish
malt
NA
NA
brewed
with
handpicked
herbs
sweet
gale
yarrow
and
wild
rosemary
this
unhopped
throwback
to
ancient
days
is
a
unique
brew
today
some
suggest
mind
altering
wed
have
to
agree
this
is
a
musttry
for
those
looking
to
expand
their
palates
and
minds
beyond
the
norm
dont
serve
too
cold
phish
fans
rejoice
o
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
gruit
so
i
didnt
quite
know
what
to
expect
this
one
seems
to
be
lacking
a
little
something
though
its
a
little
thin
in
body
and
in
malt
flavor
ill
admit
that
i
hung
onto
this
one
for
a
bit
longer
than
i
should
have
it
tastes
a
little
soured
gotta
wonder
what
the
shelf
life
is
on
this
without
any
hops
to
act
as
a
preservative
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
cbc
offering
im
glad
they
decided
to
bottle
an
odd
stye
that
can
stand
on
its
own
accord
id
drink
this
again
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
falls
a
little
flat
but
i
am
not
well
sampled
in
gruits
and
as
such
have
little
to
compare
it
to
that
being
said
i
would
try
this
again
maybe
after
trying
a
few
others
overall
you
need
to
be
prepared
for
a
legitimate
gruit
with
a
huge
herbal
forefront
untamed
by
sweetness
bitterness
or
alcohol
definitely
an
interesting
beverage
although
im
not
sure
id
try
it
again
weekapaug
gruit
is
hard
to
place
its
not
the
best
beer
but
then
again
its
not
a
beer
in
the
sense
that
im
used
to
its
not
something
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
however
its
definitely
a
brew
aficionados
should
try
and
i
applaud
cambridge
brewing
company
for
bringing
the
style
back
into
the
light
drink
it
was
tasty
i
like
the
heather
ale
a
little
bit
better
for
the
style
but
this
was
good
as
a
vegetarian
its
kind
of
nice
to
taste
roasted
chicken
again
i
guess
well
i
was
hopeful
first
sip
was
great
but
this
wears
out
its
welcome
quickly
pretty
decent
beer
one
that
should
definitely
comes
in
smaller
packages
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
not
exactly
my
bag
not
my
style
choice
that
said
it
isnt
unpleasant
and
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
thought
an
unhopped
beer
would
be
paired
with
food
it
is
actually
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
brew
its
definitely
interesting
not
having
a
hop
balance
in
there
it
leaves
the
beer
very
thick
and
heavy
im
not
sure
if
i
will
brew
a
gruit
after
getting
to
try
one
but
as
a
home
brewer
i
may
do
it
just
for
the
challenge
of
using
spices
in
place
of
hops
try
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
or
interesting
sweet
mildly
herbal
cant
directly
pick
out
the
wild
rosemary
grassy
and
clean
its
definitely
got
the
same
herbal
feel
as
say
saison
du
buff
but
absent
the
hops
its
smooth
and
detectable
bitterness
is
mild
definitely
a
sort
of
fresh
seasonally
appropriate
feel
if
this
becomes
seasonal
ill
probably
try
a
bomber
every
year
o
my
first
gruit
and
honestly
im
pleasantly
surprised
obviously
very
different
fruity
and
malty
while
being
loaded
with
herbsspices
instead
of
hops
but
still
quite
tasty
i
enjoyed
it
tough
to
compare
this
to
much
else
as
this
is
only
the
second
gruit
ive
ever
had
but
this
is
a
very
different
brew
worth
trying
so
unique
one
should
try
this
style
when
they
get
the
chance
anyway
but
this
is
done
well
good
job
overall
pretty
good
a
nice
gruit
that
combines
the
over
spiced
gruits
with
a
nice
bock
or
belgian
style
beer
it
has
nice
malts
to
balance
mild
sweetness
and
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
it
doesnt
try
to
overpower
with
bittering
herb
like
i
accidentally
did
with
wormwood
on
my
last
homebrew
gruit
i
really
like
how
the
herbs
play
in
just
the
right
amount
that
doesnt
overpower
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
destroy
drinkability
but
at
the
same
time
doesnt
disappear
into
the
background
of
the
other
flavors
of
the
beer
the
esters
fruit
bananaclove
like
from
the
yeast
add
a
nice
touch
as
well
for
a
tasty
nice
drinking
gruit
very
well
done
imo
one
of
several
phish
themed
cbc
beers
ive
been
hoping
to
try
if
you
havent
ever
had
an
ale
brewed
with
gruit
you
should
certainly
give
this
a
try
if
you
enjoy
herbal
beers
or
have
a
penchant
for
original
root
beer
from
scavenged
roots
you
very
well
may
enjoy
this
as
for
myself
i
would
rather
have
hops
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
brownish
amber
color
with
a
creamy
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
give
off
some
of
the
aroma
that
the
gruit
has
the
flavors
were
very
good
in
the
beer
i
spicy
gruit
adds
that
special
herbal
element
that
i
really
really
enjoy
in
these
beers
the
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
this
beer
was
nice
it
was
something
i
was
really
happy
to
see
at
the
ebf
and
even
more
happy
that
i
got
to
try
it
dr
very
drinkable
of
moderate
abv
and
decent
quality
d
a
great
gruit
but
i
couldnt
call
it
great
drinkabilitywise
a
tulip
or
two
would
probably
suffice
this
is
better
than
average
for
they
style
just
not
for
sessioning
imo
m
thin
and
fizzy
with
a
pleasant
chalky
texture
d
nice
and
unique
normal
beer
fair
one
is
enough
taste
mouthfeel
honeylike
sweetness
up
front
with
a
strong
backbone
of
herbs
and
spices
rosemary
and
anise
shining
through
quite
strongly
tastes
almost
like
an
herbal
tea
with
an
alcoholic
kick
sweetness
lingers
from
beginning
to
end
making
it
a
definite
sipper
but
surprisingly
enjoyable
and
unique
loads
of
hops
haha
just
kidding
this
one
true
to
style
is
brewed
without
any
hops
i
really
enjoy
this
style
and
hope
more
breweries
experiment
around
with
it
this
one
is
pure
delicious
a
total
pleasure
to
drink
itd
be
great
to
enjoy
this
at
cbcs
beautiful
brewpub
if
they
could
just
learn
how
to
interact
with
the
general
public
the
one
that
doesnt
wander
in
at
6
after
getting
off
from
its
wellpaying
white
collar
job
this
was
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
likely
try
again
theres
actually
a
warning
on
this
brew
about
how
too
much
can
lead
to
high
intoxication
and
perhaps
some
aphrodesiaclike
effects
due
to
the
mix
of
natural
herbs
that
replace
the
hops
this
is
a
wild
brew
that
proves
will
meyers
of
cbc
is
on
th
cuttingedge
of
brewing
a
real
treat
poured
out
a
cloudy
medium
brown
beer
with
a
big
thick
white
head
that
dissapeared
soon
after
being
poured
out
smelled
sour
citrusy
and
herbal
the
tastemimicks
the
nose
sour
citrus
herbs
with
a
touch
of
something
bitter
licorice
the
mouth
was
fairly
crisp
and
bubbly
the
finish
was
long
with
the
sourness
lingering
the
gruit
is
an
interesting
ale
it
doesnt
have
hops
in
it
but
still
somehow
manages
to
be
delicious
having
only
tried
one
gruit
previously
fraoch
from
scotland
i
had
an
idea
what
i
was
getting
into
the
weekapaug
gruit
named
after
a
phish
song
was
a
bit
better
its
a
deep
dark
black
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
hard
to
put
a
finger
on
some
caramel
a
bit
chamomile
it
has
a
unique
flavor
as
well
its
malty
and
somewhat
sweet
it
seem
nonbeer
until
the
wheat
and
malt
kick
in
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
an
interesting
style
and
one
most
are
probably
unfamiliar
with
i
know
i
am
not
and
i
approached
the
beer
with
an
open
mind
having
little
if
nothing
to
compare
it
to
alone
it
was
a
good
beer
slightly
alla
dopplebock
slightly
alla
rauchbier
this
is
for
sure
an
interesting
an
enjoyable
beer
i
would
say
i
would
not
rush
to
find
as
many
of
these
as
possible
and
drink
them
but
i
would
not
shy
away
from
the
style
when
it
presents
itself
either
this
beer
is
fantastic
very
authentic
and
for
those
looking
for
sort
of
a
history
lesson
of
ancient
herbed
ales
this
is
the
text
book
it
poured
a
dark
brown
that
left
a
thin
tan
lace
that
quickly
disappeared
the
aroma
is
very
flouralrosemary
wheat
grass
chocolate
flowers
very
aromatic
the
taste
is
surprisingly
sweet
upfront
followed
by
bitter
flowertree
bark
balance
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
to
eat
edible
flowers
that
is
the
bitterness
im
talking
about
it
is
then
finished
with
a
nice
malty
honey
base
that
is
so
pleasing
this
beer
is
great
with
the
combination
of
belgian
yeast
and
the
the
fresh
herbal
tastes
this
is
a
treat
my
third
time
sampling
this
style
and
i
must
say
that
i
am
quite
fond
of
it
overall
though
this
gruit
was
to
me
less
adventerous
and
more
watered
down
than
heavyweights
two
druids
it
pours
a
light
brownamberish
colour
with
a
faint
but
sticky
head
the
smell
is
has
an
herbal
tea
feel
to
it
combined
with
some
spice
fruit
sour
apple
or
lemon
perhaps
and
malt
the
flavour
is
quite
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
slight
sour
flavour
combined
with
a
touch
of
ginger
running
throughout
the
finish
is
tart
and
a
touch
sweet
this
is
definitely
a
different
style
that
may
take
some
getting
used
to
but
i
found
this
brew
to
be
quite
refreshing
and
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
murky
dark
brown
with
small
fuzzy
patches
on
top
that
stay
very
floral
and
herbal
aroma
with
dandelions
coming
to
mind
over
a
toasty
backdrop
flavor
is
toasty
caramel
swampwater
with
hints
of
rootbeer
and
a
zing
from
an
herb
that
is
hard
to
place
but
works
well
in
the
brew
finish
is
just
right
in
its
compexity
and
lenth
medium
body
medium
carbonation
smooth
feel
very
smooth
all
around
earthy
this
is
not
as
different
as
i
was
expecting
since
the
flavor
focuses
primarily
on
the
malt
it
was
however
infinitely
drinkable
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
presents
as
a
opaque
belgiandark
ale
in
appearance
with
little
head
again
i
was
having
the
sampler
glasses
on
a
lunchbreak
so
the
light
effervescense
was
probably
hampered
a
light
but
pleasing
herbal
smell
cus
its
brewed
with
herbs
yarrow
gale
rosemary
rather
than
hops
sweet
but
not
too
malty
and
quite
smooth
heck
of
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
the
benevolance
not
that
that
wasnt
fun
i
just
couldnt
take
more
than
a
halfpint
very
good
and
downright
excellent
on
a
brisk
autumn
day
basically
though
a
good
beer
not
my
favorite
its
just
not
quite
as
spicy
as
the
heather
ale
but
definitely
worth
a
try
i
was
sharing
in
the
weekapaug
gruit
at
the
cbcs
15th
anniversary
party
for
a
hopless
beer
this
is
one
balanced
and
spicey
ale
the
grainy
body
is
complimented
by
a
spice
bouquet
theres
a
lot
of
rosemary
and
yarrow
to
give
this
golden
and
headless
brew
a
pleasant
kick
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
the
beer
was
extremely
complex
considering
there
are
no
hops
added
i
loved
it
this
gruit
ale
poured
a
hazy
amber
brown
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
somewhat
sour
with
a
pungent
herbal
aroma
together
with
some
malt
grain
and
citrus
the
taste
was
citrusy
and
herbal
with
some
dry
malt
overtones
and
no
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
very
dry
and
smooth
and
crisp
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
there
was
a
citrusy
feel
and
a
malty
herbal
aftertaste
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
nice
and
refreshing
o
an
interesting
and
spicy
gruit
light
and
flavorful
amber
with
a
loose
head
that
fades
to
a
slim
ring
around
the
edge
sweet
heather
and
lavender
floral
aromas
with
fresh
herbs
grass
and
a
festive
almost
cookielike
toast
and
spice
flavor
duplicates
the
nose
almost
exactly
prominent
earthy
spicy
floral
notes
and
sweet
toasty
grain
with
an
added
slight
lemony
tartness
kind
of
soapy
by
nature
but
in
a
good
way
medium
bodied
slick
and
lightly
carbonated
glad
to
see
this
is
about
as
good
as
i
remember
it
from
several
years
ago
o
this
is
pretty
interesting
spiced
and
herbal
all
over
its
like
seasonal
fall
cookies
meets
beefy
stew
all
topped
with
a
flowery
bouquet
and
a
dash
of
white
cooking
wine
o
very
interesting
my
first
foray
into
the
gruit
style
i
enjoyed
this
i
would
recommend
it
i
dont
see
myself
buying
it
again
though
i
like
how
the
toasted
malts
spices
and
apparently
flowers
come
together
it
reminds
me
of
some
pumpkin
ales
but
also
has
an
added
complexity
not
seen
in
those
the
beer
pours
a
dirty
golden
brown
color
almost
like
honey
or
a
light
cream
soda
the
head
is
massive
and
creamy
white
with
big
rocky
soap
bubbles
that
leave
foamy
clinging
bits
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
beers
body
is
fairly
clear
with
a
nice
light
haze
murking
the
body
enough
that
this
beer
is
not
entirely
translucent
on
the
nose
this
beer
smells
sweetly
herbal
with
a
good
grainy
kick
the
herbs
pack
a
lovely
cornucopia
of
spices
onto
the
nose
moving
from
minty
to
spicy
to
everywhere
inbetween
the
beer
almost
smells
like
a
super
spicy
hefeweizen
as
it
has
some
awesome
banana
and
clove
esters
lying
as
the
backbone
of
this
beer
the
smell
is
quite
enticing
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
like
a
liquefied
and
refreshing
spicy
bread
with
light
touches
of
banana
the
heather
shines
in
the
beer
obviously
leaving
an
almost
minty
tingle
on
the
mouth
the
beer
begins
with
light
grainy
bread
with
a
faint
touch
of
banana
esters
before
it
opens
into
an
herbal
wonderland
that
starts
more
spicy
moves
towards
grainy
then
bursts
with
big
cooling
herbal
mint
flavors
before
rounding
itself
into
perfect
balance
of
all
of
the
different
flavors
listed
the
aftertaste
is
of
light
tingly
herbal
mint
heather
with
a
touch
of
grainy
bread
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
certain
congealing
feeling
to
it
as
it
stretches
out
over
the
tongue
the
beer
is
supremely
refreshing
and
clean
feeling
though
the
strong
herbal
flavors
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
do
place
a
slight
graininess
on
the
tongue
the
mouth
is
left
clean
with
some
nice
little
puddles
on
the
sides
of
the
my
tongue
begging
for
more
of
the
beer
overall
this
beer
is
supremely
tasty
and
another
excellent
example
of
the
burgeoning
american
gruit
scene
bready
complex
refreshing
rejuvenating
my
list
of
descriptions
for
this
beer
could
go
on
and
on
this
is
a
delicious
success
from
the
stellar
cbc
and
definitely
a
beer
you
should
try
i
am
definitely
unfamiliar
with
this
style
and
went
into
it
only
knowing
it
as
an
ale
brewed
with
heather
flowers
a
dry
and
weirdly
abrasive
finish
jlindrosoct

quite
smooth
and
unique
with
some
nice
spice
notes
the
taste
is
pretty
nice

NA
not
a
bad
brew
not
a
lot
of
complexity
but
tastes
good
i
would
drink
again
the
name
of
the
beer
suits
the
appearance
to
a
tea
actually
the
taste
is
very
harsh
and
unusual
not
an
everyday
drinking
beer
if
this
beer
had
some
brett
in
it
i
think
it
would
be
awesome
quite
nice
offering
as
is
i
like
the
unique
terrior
and
the
myrtle
certainly
comes
across
with
some
woody
spicy
notes
all
round
an
interesting
gruit
certainly
pushing
different
worth
a
try
maybe
yet
the
bitterness
or
tartness
could
be
ramped
up
to
improve
complexity
overall
pretty
damn
good
gruit
whilst
being
something
interesting
and
fairly
unique
this
still
isnt
my
style
but
this
is
a
very
good
effort
definitely
may
pick
up
a
couple
bottles
when
my
more
experimental
friends
come
over
final
grade

a
solid
b
beaus
bog
water
is
an
interesting
diversion
if
nothing
else
i
wouldnt
mind
another
bottle
on
occasion
but
its
not
something
im
going
to
be
stocking
up
on
or
seeking
out
i
enjoyed
this
glass
and
while
the
beer
itself
would
make
a
fine
afterdinner
digestif
its
not
the
sort
of
stuff
id
be
interested
in
drinking
in
large
quantities
if
spiced
beers
are
your
thing
then
this
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
cheers
to
beaus
for
having
the
guts
to
brew
an
obscure
esoteric
beer
style
even
if
its
not
entirely
up
my
alley
thx
for
reading
overall
this
brew
has
the
elements
in
place
for
the
style
and
the
flavour
profile
is
quite
different
then
other
beers
i
am
accustomed
to
this
beer
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
for
me
i
found
it
enjoyable
please
bring
back
strong
patrick
overall
interesting
though
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
seems
over
carbonated
making
it
a
little
harsh
but
its
quite
palate
able
overall
o
waited
too
long
to
have
this
beer
this
is
a
great
gruit
to
me
its
like
a
better
version
of
a
wee
heavy
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
mediumbodied
with
somewhat
low
carbonation
smooth
mouthfeel
nice
beer
and
i
dont
mean
this
as
a
complaint
since
i
enjoyed
it
but
there
really
is
something
about
it
that
makes
it
seem
more
dunkelweisse
than
dubbel
but
hey
those
belgian
yeast
strains
can
be
pretty
estery
and
phenolic
as
well
final
thoughts
well
its
not
quite
as
good
as
the
muskoka
spring
oddity
but
im
glad
to
see
another
excellent
ontario
beer
utilizing
gruit
and
other
herbs
besides
hops
id
love
to
see
these
guys
do
a
heather
ale
after
this
o
i
love
this
beer
i
love
it
everytime
i
get
it
and
i
will
continue
to
get
this
beaus
all
naturals
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
ontario
by
far
pours
a
deep
rich
raisin
brown
that
seems
fairly
clear
with
a
nice
head
that
leaves
very
light
lacing
tons
of
belgian
esters
on
the
nose
including
barnyard
aromas
along
with
notes
of
chocolate
body
is
quite
sweet
with
raisin
notes
and
some
herbal
notes
along
with
tartness
and
a
cloying
finish
tart
cloying
mouthfeel
over
time
holy
hell
this
is
sweet
while
i
appreciate
the
attempt
i
do
not
really
like
it
meh
so
much
initial
promise
bog
water
has
the
mildewy
earthy
forestfloor
profile
that
recalls
the
10000
year
old
peat
bog
for
which
its
named
and
the
surrounding
countryside
of
a
wet
cold
eastern
ontario
it
is
a
distinct
but
appropriate
winter
seasonal
and
unless
im
mistaken
the
first
gruit
attempted
by
a
canadian
brewer
bravo
not
something
id
have
frequently
but
once
a
year
sounds
good
o
its
dubbel
like
profile
is
pretty
average
but
the
use
of
myrtle
instead
of
hops
certainly
gives
this
one
an
interesting
flavour
o
very
interesting
and
im
always
glad
to
see
a
gruit
on
the
market
its
not
super
punchy
but
well
done
and
interesting
especially
in
ontario
o
im
going
by
style
here
and
in
the
spicedherb
beer
category
this
is
really
a
great
beer
its
interesting
refreshing
and
something
i
really
enjoy
drinking
that
kind
of
cola
rootbirch
beer
taste
combined
with
the
nice
malts
and
the
sour
yeast
is
a
great
combination
id
actually
buy
six
packs
of
this
if
it
was
a
yearround
option
overall
a
very
interesting
and
complex
experiment
like
a
lighter
belgian
abbey
but
the
hops
and
length
are
missed
d
quite
good
with
a
strong
herbalgrassy
farmhouselike
element
as
advertised
might
not
be
something
regularly
stocked
in
my
fridge
but
certainly
would
occasionally
pick
this
up
again

an

some

in
the

although
it
isnt
too
prohibitive
mouthfeel

and
carbonation

low
but
kinda
helps
this
out
an
interesting
pint
i
would
revisit
this
o
very
interesting
style
belgian
dubbel
in
all
aspects
with
a
little
ganja
not
bad
not
great
overall
this
one
actually
reminded
me
a
bit
of
their
dunkel
buck
but
with
a
lot
less
sweetness
and
taste
it
had
a
very
poor
appearance
and
there
was
really
nothing
exciting
about
the
beer
it
almost
tasted
like
gruit
lite
if
such
a
thing
existed
it
needs
a
bump
up
in
the
flavour
department
and
some
more
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
but
an
interesting
brew
nonetheless
and
hell
its
almost
7
always
a
plus
in
my
book
but
not
really
the
gruit
fix
i
was
hoping
for
worth
a
try
at
any
rate
od
quite
a
pleasant
brew
but
underperforms
in
a
couple
of
areas
would
benefit
from
a
more
robust
latetasteaftertaste
more
carbonation
and
a
little
more
substance
that
said
one
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
without
too
much
difficulty
at
all
this
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
and
unique
ontario
offerings
ive
had
to
date
with
that
being
said
its
not
an
exceptional
one
i
prefer
their
kolsch
over
this
id
still
say
this
is
worth
a
try
od
interesting
not
overly
pleasant
though
a
small
sample
would
have
done
the
sahti
similarity
is
cool
and
the
novelty
of
it
scores
it
points
but
more
malt
backbone
would
have
dones
this
good
with
caramel
or
bready
notes
reminds
me
of
their
dunkel
buck
a
bit
a
very
nice
wild
ale
that
for
me
ranks
as
the
brewerys
best

at

what
pours
a
murky
orange
colour
with
hints
of
brownamber
head
starts
out
thick
but
dissipates
to
small
ring
on
the
top
some
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
berries
and
spices
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
exactly
what
im
smelling
very
sweet
flavour
but
still
some
tartness
smooth
mouthfeel
quite
a
different
beer
but
nice
this
has
a
wonderfully
quirky
complexity
that
is
sure
to
be
misunderstood
by
unseasoned
palates
but
for
those
who
can
appreciate
the
melding
of
a
number
of
uncommon
complimentary
flavors
this
is
a
brew
you
can
relish
and
not
be
shy
about
having
a
couple
weird
oldentimes
brews
like
this
are
neat
to
try
and
i
would
probably
drink
more
of
this
if
hops
were
to
suddenly
vanish
but
in
the
meantime
one
is
enough
for
my
newfangled
palate
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
i
dug
this
one
good
stab
at
the
style
d
very
drinkable
for
its
weight
and
lack
of
hops
myrtle
is
lemony
and
adds
a
citrus
tang
to
tea
as
a
hop
replacement
this
is
odd
and
different
and
queer
dark
brown
with
offwhite
soapy
head
and
lacey
horse
smell
in
there
vegetable
aroma
and
in
taste
medium
mouthfeel
and
aggressive
carbonation
i
had
this
at
the
black
tomato
in
ottawa
i
liked
the
beaus
lug
tread
which
had
a
fresh
cut
grass
or
hay
flavour
so
i
was
more
than
willing
to
give
this
a
try
the
waiter
told
me
it
was
made
with
gale
which
is
an
aromatic
bog
myrtle
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
it
starts
with
a
minty
taste
that
soon
wahse
into
something
like
ginger
and
licorice
it
actually
reminded
me
somewhat
of
a
real
root
beer
im
not
sure
that
i
would
drink
more
than
a
pint
of
this
at
a
go
but
with
a
meal
it
was
a
very
welcomed
beer
a
standout
beer
especially
in
ontario
beaus
has
taken
an
ancient
tradition
and
used
it
in
a
completely
different
style
ottawans
can
say
theyve
got
a
beer
nobody
else
does
makes
me
feel
all
warm
and
fuzzy
or
it
could
have
been
the
beer
distinctive
and
interesting
but
worth
trying
i
would
pick
this
up
again
if
i
have
the
chance
overall
one
of
the
better
beaus
beers
i
have
had
it
had
a
well
balanced
taste
and
was
fairly
interesting
id
pick
up
more
of
this
if
i
saw
it
at
my
local
store
od
seems
to
much
like
mom
added
too
much
nutmeg
to
the
cookies
or
something
i
applaud
the
effort
but
there
would
be
no
reason
to
drink
more
than
half
a
bottle
of
this
even
that
was
a
bit
tough
seemed
like
they
did
what
they
intended
to
just
wasnt
up
my
alley
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
bold
but
still
approachable
complex
but
easy
to
comprehend
a
thinking
beer
as
each
sip
peels
back
another
layer
the
use
of
trappist
ale
yeast
brings
that
much
more
to
the
palate
nothing
short

amazing
here
came
to
the
table

with
some
flashes
of
some
burgundy
at

with
little

and
no

is
an
earthy
mocha
dark
chocolate

and
organic
notes
abound
taste
is
somewhat
similar
with
a
real
earthy
chocolate

and
even
more
organic
than
the
nose
some
cocoa
light
wheat
and
banana
notes
even
some

light
roast
coffee
in
the
periphery
as
well
quite
a
decent
mouthfeel
creamy
and
quite
good
cask
feel
to
it
somewhat
interesting
overall
but
it
lacks
focus
and
feels
all
over
the
place
interesting
but
just
ok
thanks
beaus

something

herby
with

notes
as
well
taste
is
slightly
sweet
earthy
and
notes
of
tea
are
detected
slightly
creamy
i
think
thats
largely
the
effect
of
the
cask
pretty
thin
body
that
was
slightly
watery
but
overall
enjoyable
very
interesting
brew
unique
abv
unnoticeable
could
not
make
this
an
everyday
brew
but
this
is
a
solid
one
off
for
sure
very
unique
and
a
great
experiment
not
an
every
day
drinker
but
a
pleasant
beer
as
an
occasional
oneoff
i
like
how
they
eschewed
hops
and
still
managed
to
pull
this
off
it
seems
like
a
very
dogfish
head
style
beer
and
i
couldnt
see
sam
doing
it

o

my

gruit
and
i
like

i
can

in

the
beer
this

i
have
to

had
some

too
gotta
try
some
more
of
what
this
brewery
has
to
offer
a
solid
beer
with
lots
of
interesting
character
the
smokiness
is
a
little
surprising
for
the
gruit
but
appropriate
and
the
esters
and
very
mild
citrus
notes
add
great
complexity
overall
i
was
surprised
by
the
level
of
roast
in
this
beer
very
interesting
and
worth
a
shot
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
inviting
aroma
complex
flavors
high
drinkability
and
pleasing
to
the
mouth
if
you
come
across
it
pick
it
up
or
try
a
glass
even
for
those
that
dont
like
stouts
though
i
know
it
isnt
the
style
it
shares
similarities
this
might
suprise
you
d
goes
down
quite
easily
nice
kick
not
too
filling
ive
never
had
this
style
before
but
i
would
gladly
snag
this
one
again
drinkability
is
hard
for
me
to
rate
i
dont
have
another
bottle
but
if
i
did
would
i
drink
it
now
yes
but
i
couldnt
say
if
i
would
even
finish
it
tastes
more
herbal
the
farther
you
get
into
a
bottle
hmm
different
definitely
good
in
small
doses
d
it
may
not
always
be
great
but
the
guys
at
the
haandbryggeriet
always
do
something
interesting
that
expands
your
palate
this
isnt
a
mindblowing
beer
but
it
is
a
good
beer
dark
powerful
but
ultimately
a
contemplative
effort

enough

a
fairly
dry

o
a
very
complex
and
delicious
beer
the
ingredients
and
barrel
aging
all
worked
together
perfectly
to
give
this
a
very
wellrounded
and
unique
flavor
definitely
work
checking
out
overall
really
good
i
cant
pick
out
herbs
but
it
is
damn
good
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yelloworange
with
no
head
or
sediment
the
nose
is
subtle
and
herbal
predominantly
highlights
the
lemongrass

also
has
notes
of
gin
yeast

taste
has
a
mild
herbal
quality
modest
lemony
tartness
and
a
slight
bite
from
the
peppercorns
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
with
approachable
herbal
qualities
easy
drinkability
thats
perfect
for
summer
despite
its
relatively
complex
flavor
profile
and
a
citrusy
tart
slightly
bitter
and
semidry
finish
this
beer
has
a
tremendous
amount
of
interesting
flavors
but
is
pulled
off
very
well
and
is
definitely
a
beer
id
enjoy
again
in
the
future
overall
an
exquisite
beer
that
i
feel
lucky
to
have
tried
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
body
with
dry
puckering
funk
and
a
very
prominent
brett
presence
countered
by
spicy
ginger
sweet
juniper
and
earthy
barrel
notes
lots
of
dry
oak
and
damp
earthy
funk
dominating
the
flavor
again
im
picking
up
spices
and
wild
yeast
but
not
much
peach
or
wine
character
very
dry
but
has
decent
flavor
especially
from
the
wild
yeast
light
fruit
and
gin
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
i
could
kill
a
bottle
of
this
pretty
regularly
if
i
had
easy
access
to
it
overall
i
dont
know
what
to
say
about
this
except
that
its
awesome
and
i
dont
know
why
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
slightly
sour
and
tart
with
malt
grain
herb
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
and
tart
fruit
and
herbal
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
great
sour
and
herbal
flavor
that
makes
this
one
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
as
a
big
lover
of
gin
and
they
were
exceeded
i
wish
i
could
get
this
more
often
i
love
the
berry
flavor
additions
to
the
more
standard
light
gueuzelike
qualities
the
gin
and
wine
barrels
have
made
this
beer
absolutely
outstanding
very
complex
very
well
balanced
and
outlandishly
refreshing
and
delicious
using
gin
barrels
for
a
gruit
is
something
that
on
the
face
of
it
seems
a
nobrainer
but
is
seldom
done
and
neer
so
well
its
been
a
while
since
i
was
this
impressed
with
a
beer
brilliant
and
inspired
o
floral
and
oakybarrel
light
and
very
tasty
m
light
to
medium
bodied
o
a
terrific
scent
and
flavour
thats
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
the
interesting
notes
of
the
herbs
bloom
as
the
brew
warms
well
worth
the
wait
would
pair
well
with
bbq
fish
and
a
summer
patio
overall
light
and
refreshing
with
plenty
of
subtle
complexity
a
winner
for
sure
very
much
enjoying
it
this
is
just
flat
out
excellent
on
par
with
the
sole
comp
version
one
of
the
best
from
this
brewery
the
addition
of
peach
balances
and
compliments
the
dry
gin
which
dominated
the
sole
comp
batch
great
stuff
NA
cheers
o
just
ok
for
me
d
this
was
interesting
and
im
guessing
this
new
batch
is
superior
to
the
ones
previously
reviewed
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
heather
tips
were
distinct
but
not
overpowering
not
something
id
want
often
but
a
pretty
enjoyable
gruit
finish
was
smoother
than
i
expected
like
a
good
earl
grey
tea
thanks
to
trbeer
for
delivering
this
one
pours
a
onefinger
cream
head
over
a
rust
colored
liquid
the
beer
is
cloudy
with
floating
bits
as
i
accidentally
poured
the
sediment
from
the
bottle
into
the
glass
smells
earthy
and
floral
roses
and
has
some
sweet
orange
has
a
vienna
malt
sort
of
taste
with
a
downward
acidic
pull
very
aromatic
and
interesting
tastes
potently
sour
tart
starts
with
cherries
and
pineapple
sour
green
apple
then
an
earthy
tartness
acidic
and
metallic
has
a
dry
sweetness
below
the
potent
sour
throughout
there
is
almost
an
oily
feel
in
my
mouth
that
correlates
with
a
flower
taste
you
know
how
roses
smellthats
what
the
floral
tastes
like
medium
to
mediumlight
mouthfeel
and
mediumheavy
carbonation
im
truly
amazed
they
were
able
to
capture
the
floral
essence
so
well
in
smell
and
taste
if
they
could
tame
that
sour
this
would
be
a
truly
fantastic
beer
as
is
i
had
a
hard
time
choking
down
the
last
gulp
you
really
can
taste
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
underneath
and
kuhnhenns
has
served
slightly
off
batches
in
the
past
so
i
wouldnt
be
shocked
if
this
isnt
the
desired
final
product
i
kind
of
hope
thats
the
case
really
only
ok
by
their
standards
at
the
very
least
this
is
my
first
gruit
beer
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
copper
brown
color
very
little
head
there
is
not
much
aroma
a
little
malty
smell
with
a
whiff
of
herb
the
taste
gives
a
little
of
the
same
maltinessherbiness
with
a
discernible
rosemary
taste
in
the
finish
the
overall
effect
is
decent
but
i
find
my
palate
wanting
more
bitterness
this
is
an
interesting
beverage
i
would
recommend
trying
o
the
negative
reviews
are
not
really
justified
its
a
gruit
it
isnt
supposed
to
taste
like
the
beer
you
know
there
is
a
reason
it
died
out
circa
1500
the
unique
bitterness
and
unfiltered
sour
component
alone
make
it
a
worthy
try
the
herbal
component
is
mild
but
present
a
knowledge
of
the
herbs
would
help
in
the
appreciation
of
this
brew
mt
pleasant
sacred
gruit
is
not
a
conventional
ale
nor
does
it
taste
like
one
i
bought
it
expecting
as
much
but
also
hoped
it
would
be
more
interesting
its
not
its
unique
ingredients
that
distinguishes
it
from
other
beers
its
its
totally
forgettable
dismissible
drinkability
whether
viewed
as
a
novel
experiment
or
simply
a
pleasant
drink
it
fails
on
both
counts
people
who
go
by
the
label
and
expect
a
pale
ale
will
be
disappointed
but
people
who
are
looking
for
something
on
the
level
of
a
low
end
jolly
pumpkin
sour
might
enjoy
this
flavor
for
the
price
i
really
found
it
quite
enjoyable
and
find
some
of
the
negative
reviews
to
be
mind
boggling
this
is
by
far
the
one
of
the
most
disturbing
beers
ive
ever
had
didnt
smell
very
good
or
taste
very
good
i
purchased
it
from
the
brewery
in
mt
p
so
it
should
have
been
fresh
might
be
for
some
but
most
def
not
for
me
bought
two
gave
second
one
to
a
friend
he
didnt
care
for
it
either
o
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
judge
mainly
because
you
cant
approach
it
like
most
other
beer
but
that
being
said
there
are
some
rough
edges
here
i
was
really
interested
to
try
a
commercial
gruit
example
the
only
thing
similar
ive
had
is
williams
brothers
fraoch
heather
and
it
was
decidedly
better
the
smell
was
the
best
part
of
the
beer
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
definitely
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
would
not
buy
this
again
and
cant
recommend
it
even
for
the
curious
o
an
interesting
and
refreshing
beer
this
is
only
the
second
gruit
ive
had
and
the
first
was
radically
different
with
juniper
and
lavender
this
one
is
more
like
a
berliner
weissetart
and
sour
yet
light
and
refreshing
enjoyable
overall
though
shows
no
alcohol
and
some
would
like
just
for
the
refreshing
and
appealing
tones
light
citric
finish
i
think
this
is
a
love
it
or
hate
it
kind
of
beer
i
love
it
overall
i
was
pretty
indifferent
about
this
beer
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
for
sure
didnt
love
it
this
is
my
first
of
the
style
so
i
dont
really
know
how
on
par
this
beer
is
but
if
i
had
to
guess
i
would
say
that
its
pretty
average
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
but
the
flavor
really
didnt
hold
my
attention
so
one
is
enough
for
me
but
this
beer
might
hit
the
spot
on
a
really
hot
day
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
wasnt
bad
and
it
reminded
me
of
nicie
spicie
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
that
it
seemed
to
be
pretty
average
all
around
no
aspect
stuck
out
as
being
really
well
done
i
wont
be
buy
this
again
i
could
think
of
a
lot
of
other
beers
that
i
would
much
rather
have
for
the
same
price
if
you
are
a
gruit
fan
then
this
is
worth
a
try
to
see
where
it
stands
but
i
dont
think
i
would
recommend
it
to
my
friends
as
a
good
beer
even
to
the
ones
that
dont
like
hoppy
beers
i
wasnt
too
into
this
beer
there
wasnt
anything
about
it
that
impressed
me
but
it
for
sure
wasnt
horrible
tasting
just
pretty
boring
and
not
exciting
at
all
this
beer
falls
in
the
same
category
as
most
of
mt
pleasants
beers
average
i
am
still
waiting
to
really
impressed
by
this
brewery
my
first
gruit
didnt
leave
a
great
first
impression
but
i
will
still
be
looking
for
more
of
this
style
drinkability
this
is
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
i
qyite
liked
it
it
is
easy
to
dring
and
repeatable
somewhat
memorable
maybe
because
it
was
my
first
i
really
dont
know
and
provides
good
value
for
the
money
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
no
hops
beer
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
while
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
id
definitely
order
it
again
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
definately
didnt
leave
you
wanting
to
come
back
for
more
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
mountain
town
yet
you
really
need
to
try
this
this
was
my
first
experience
with
gruit
the
girl
pouring
the
beer
explained
that
it
was
one
of
their
newer
experimental
beers
brewed
in
similar
style
to
those
before
beer
included
hops
it
had
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
quarterinch
head
easy
drinking
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
nice
light
pilsner
d
good
i
might
have
it
agian
fun
to
try
overall
for
a
no
hop
beer
it
was
pretty
decent
it
was
kind
of
bland
but
alright
not
something
i
really
want
a
lot
of
though
strong
peach
flavor
moderate
sweetness
delicious
a
beer
from
mt
pleasant
brewing
company
my
hometown
i
actually
tried
the
beer
up
north
near
petoskey
the
beer
itself
if
full
bodied
and
very
sweet
it
tastes
of
peaches
and
fruit
but
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
palate
i
enjoyed
the
beer
i
had
but
having
just
one
was
enough
for
me
o
im
not
usually
into
fruity
beers
but
this
beer
really
hit
the
spot
on
this
hot
day
super
tasty
and
very
refreshing
poured
a
clear
orange
body
with
minimal
head
and
little
lace
aroma
is
spicy
and
not
something
one
usually
finds
in
a
beer
anise
and
ginger
stick
out
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
a
little
sticky
and
sweet
yet
balanced
with
spices
like
anise
ginger
and
rosemary
clean
beer
easy
to
drink
nice
finish
not
your
typical
beer
i
e
ipas
stouts
and
was
well
worth
trying
ive
said
too
much
bodied
the
best
gruit
ive
ever
had
find
this
and
drink
this
you
wont
be
dissapointed
o
unique
and
glad
to
say
thank
god
for
hops
bitter
like
unicum
zwack
similar
in
taste
to
a
herbal
bitter
underberg
etc
would
make
a
very
nice
digestif
not
a
quaffable
beer
but
a
nice
drink
st
the
end
of
german
soapy
bright
herbaceous
taste
golden
straw
appearance
with
an
almost
nonexistent
head
overall
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
an
exceptionally
good
beer
very
different
but
very
good
i
will
drink
it
again
and
again
and
flowing
smoothly
on
the
tongue
and
with
a
crisp
bite
that
never
fades
theres
a
dryness
both
from
a
leafy
and
woody
feel
and
from
a
certain
acidity
that
carries
through
without
being
harsh
the
lemony
tang
and
zest
evens
out
the
dryness
and
lingers
well
an
odd
beer
for
sure
but
very
interesting
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
but
i
like
the
idea
of
the
beer
completely
i
could
see
sipping
on
this
instead
of
a
hot
toddy
next
time
im
sick
with
a
nasty
cold
i
would
hope
all
the
herbs
contain
some
sort
of
healing
powers
that
i
could
extol
among
my
friends
when
theyre
sick
as
well
try
this
its
strange
and
hard
to
drink
but
has
mysterious
healing
powers
no
one
can
explain
yeah
i
like
this
give
me
a
13th
century
grut
anytime
cheers
overall
i
really
cant
get
past
the
medicinal
taste
and
extreme
astringency
i
like
to
think
i
have
a
pretty
expansive
palate
and
there
are
very
few
beers
i
just
cannot
drink
but
this
is
one
this
might
just
take
the
cake
as
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tried
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
thick
but
shortlived
head
slight
greenish
hue
to
this
one
my
glass
was
devoid
of
lacing
less
than
half
way
through
which
made
my
glass
feel
naked
the
nose
is
full
of
spices
citrus
and
herbs
i
get
a
face
full
of
bay
leaf
right
off
the
bat
and
hints
of
the
rosemary
and
ginger
looking
for
the
anise
and
caraway
but
couldnt
lock
onto
any
of
those
licoricelike
aromatics
taste
is
tart
but
very
herbaceous
lemon
and
lemon
rind
full
of
pith
bitter
botanicals
from
the
steeping
of
the
herbs
and
spices
the
bay
and
rosemary
really
come
through
in
the
front
with
ginger
playing
a
supporting
role
the
caraway
and
anise
are
there
if
you
really
go
looking
for
them
but
are
easily
lost
in
the
complex
dance
of
flavors
on
this
stage
the
lasting
finish
is
dry
with
a
prolonged
bitterness
on
the
palate
that
reminds
me
of
oversteeping
lemon
peels
in
hot
tea
the
bay
sticks
around
for
a
long
while
i
dont
pick
up
any
of
the
wheat
nor
much
of
the
rosemary
but
this
is
one
worth
returning
to
more
than
once
to
ponder
the
depths
of
this
polyglot
brew
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
not
very
high
in
comparison
to
the
initial
head
but
present
enough
to
play
its
part
overall
its
a
very
interesting
interesting
quaff
and
this
historic
signature
series
is
well
worth
seeking
out
from
the
500
ml
bottle
purchased
at
mayfair
liquors
in
denver
my
first
gruit
to
rate
at
least
though
ive
had
the
scottish
heather
and
seaweed
ones
this
is
a
superbly
refreshing
beer
similar
to
a
radler
i
imagine
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
to
relax
with
in
the
shade
with
friends
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
prost
kind
of
makes
me
glad
to
be
a
beer
drinker
today
not
then
o
interesting
beverage
from
the
13th
century
a
little
bread
note
with
hints
of
spice
bitterness
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
palate
overall
a
style
im
glad
to
have
gotten
the
opportunity
to
sample
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
other
brewers
takes
on
the
style
similar
to
how
berliner
weisse
another
professor
fritz
briem
portfolio
beer
has
become
increasingly
popular
in
the
last
several
years
it
seems
this
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
the
limited
experience
ive
had
with
the
sahti
style
personally
ill
stick
with
hops
for
my
bittering
and
flavor
when
given
a
choice
overall
this
is
probably
the
first
or
second
gruit
beer
ive
ever
had
and
i
enjoyed
it
not
an
everyday
kind
of
beer
but
one
that
certainly
deepens
my
appreciation
for
beers
long
history
and
wide
variety
its
also
a
wellmade
beer
in
its
own
right
o
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
i
gotta
say
its
superb
the
spices
really
work
as
weird
as
they
seem
a
great
easy
drinking
summer
beer
i
will
definitely
grab
more
of
this
cheers
o
in
my
mind
this
is
the
best
of
the
more
readily
available
gruit
ales
on
the
market
something
that
truly
stands
out
and
its
so
drinkable
and
only
a
german
or
better
british
yeast
seems
appropriate
for
this
style
belgian
gruit
is
a
wastejoke
the
yeast
must
have
some
hand
in
the
flavor
here
but
it
still
allows
the
flavorings
to
come
through
definitely
try
this
if
you
havent
bought
from
tacoma
boys
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
lot
of
sediments
floating
around
smells
fantastic
tons
of
spices
cinnamon
rosemary
fruit
and
zest
taste
is
slightly
tart
with
some
ginger
and
rosemary
notes
pretty
good
dose
of
carbonation
compared
to
the
appearance
very
light
body
with
an
abrupt
finish
and
absolutely
no
bitterness
not
bad
and
i
love
this
style
of
beer
always
interesting
and
the
history
is
intriguing
as
well
i
am
excited
by
the
concept
of
gruits
and
the
wild
flexibility
and
variability
they
offer
the
ability
to
flavor
beer
with
just
about
anything
and
to
get
away
from
hops
as
the
main
character
note
but
this
one
went
to
a
bad
place
im
a
little
discouraged
because
the
bros
said
in
their
review
that
this
was
one
of
the
very
best
gruits
theyd
ever
tried
poured
into
an
elysian
snifter
pours
a
clear
honey
amber
with
a
hint
of
a
head
that
dissipated
immediately
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
no
lacing
amazing
aroma
of
rosemary
bay
leaves
ginger
apple
juice
light
citrus
other
unidentifiable
aromatic
herbs
much
like
a
kitchen
dried
potpourri
starts
with
apple
and
pear
juice
light
grape
juice
slightly
vinous
aromatic
herbs
dominated
by
rosemary
slightly
sweet
finishes
abruptly
with
dry
earthy
herbs
leaving
a
light
but
pleasant
dried
herb
aftertaste
light
bodied
a
very
enjoyable
reconstruction
of
this
ancient
ale
style
although
i
have
greatly
enjoyed
some
of
the
other
sweeter
gruit
reconstructions
from
scottish
and
american
breweries
this
one
struck
me
as
more
authentic
a
part
of
me
wished
for
a
bit
more
abv
to
bring
out
the
intensity
of
the
bittering
herbs
i
like
this
professor
briem
series
and
am
glad
that
he
is
bringing
these
old
styles
back
to
life
o
despite
a
couple
of
rough
edges
the
soapy
astringency
in
the
finish
detracted
from
the
experience
slightly
this
was
a
tasty
foray
into
the
sort
of
beverage
our
ancestors
enjoyed
not
a
drink
for
everyday
consumption
but
a
nice
just
because
experience
overall
a
very
unique
and
interesting
beer
id
like
to
try
some
other
examples
of
the
style
but
would
probably
not
seek
out
this
one
again
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
once
is
enough
for
me
pours
a
dulled
golden
straw
lots
of
haze
and
particulate
moderate
cap
of
big
bubbles
short
lasting
scent
brings
a
deep
bouquet
of
of
presh
picked
herbs
quite
a
bit
of
ginger
and
sage
on
the
nose
light
sugary
and
fruity
sweetness
and
faintly
bready
malt
again
fresh
picked
herbs
everywhere
on
the
tongue
luckily
all
work
well
in
conjunction
with
none
being
overly
palate
smashing
little
notes
of
sweet
juicy
berries
play
well
with
the
herbal
notes
lighter
side
of
medium
moderately
carbonated
suprised
by
how
well
the
taste
came
together
enjoyable
still
the
oddball
herbalism
that
is
contained
within
works
i
can
tell
that
every
component
has
been
carefully
counterbalanced
against
each
other
for
the
net
gain
of
something
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
well
worth
experiencing
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
500

is

alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
no
warming
present
on
the
finish
at
all
as
expected
extremely
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
nice
gruit
style
ale
the
aromas
were
certainly
interesting
but
the
taste
was
nicely
balanced
and
very
smooth
this
was
quite
enjoyable
very
interesting
beer
easy
to
dink
low
alcohol
and
low
carbonation
goes
down
easy
not
my
favorite
but
worth
giving
a
shot
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
still
have
a
few
styles
too
try
but
this
one
brings
me
a
little
closer
to
hitting
them
all
o
huge
surprise
in
how
much
i
like
this
beer
i
would
actually
drink
it
on
occasion
not
every
week
but
definitely
atleast
once
a
month
nice
work
fritz
o
this
is
fun
this
isnt
an
every
kind
of
night
of
beverage
but
this
is
just
a
fun
and
different
kind
of
drink
o
a
very
good
beer
interesting
to
say
the
least
and
full
of
great
flavors
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
im
glad
to
be
getting
this
after
hoping
to
see
it
for
a
while
the
beer
is
a
pale
dull
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
and
huge
chunks
of
yeast
this
beer
is
obviously
a
living
organism
and
smells
incredible
there
are
strong
herbal
notes
without
anything
distinct
in
particular
along
with
a
sour
tartness
that
screams
zesty
lemons
absolutely
divine
drinking
with
a
thin
watery
but
zingy
mouthfeel
which
is
rather
unexpected
its
highly
drinkable
and
reminds
me
of
a
mild
ginger
beer
that
would
cool
off
the
hottest
of
summer
days
i
would
definitely
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
shot
if
youve
never
tried
a
gruit
before
it
puts
dfhs
ta
hen
ket
to
shame
and
yes
i
know
thk
isnt
technically
a
gruit
but
its
full
of
funky
herbs
from
the
egyptian
market
nonetheless
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
12
inch
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
herbs
spices
and
some
interesting
sourtart
aromas
taste
is
of
grain
leafsherbs
spices
and
a
sourness
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
an
interesting
history
behind
it
but
its
definitely
weird
in
a
good
way
this
poured
out
as
a
bright
hazy
looking
yellow
color
with
a
big
fizzy
white
head
with
lots
of
chunky
sediment
the
head
fades
but
the
carbonation
spits
from
the
top
of
the
beer
similar
to
how
soda
does
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
lemony
with
some
herbal
qualities
to
it
it
smells
refreshing
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
herbal
with
some
citrus
hints
in
the
distance
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
very
carbonated
and
a
little
on
the
watery
side
overall
i
enjoyed
trying
the
beer
i
cant
say
id
buy
it
again
but
it
was
nice
to
have
once
o
very
interesting
style
and
a
pretty
good
example
of
it
i
have
had
a
couple
of
others
and
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
them
though
not
a
style
that
i
have
frequently
i
really
enjoy
the
savory
aspects
of
the
smell
and
taste
not
a
real
sessionable
beer
but
definitely
good
poured
from
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
blonde
haze
with
a
fizzy
white
head
aroma
is
unique
of
some
ginger
peppery
notes
herbs
and
spices
taste
is
more
sweet
than
spicy
the
ginger
comes
forth
but
not
as
prominently
the
herbs
are
there
but
lean
heavier
on
the
rosemary
the
peppery
spices
seem
tamed
as
well
sweet
malt
and
wheat
come
through
towards
the
back
end
body
is
light
and
refreshing
with
the
carbonation
being
creamier
than
expected
ends
with
more
ginger
and
peppery
flavors
light
rosemary
sweet
malt
and
grains
definitely
an
unique
beer
from
old
germany
pale
malt
and
very
watery
up
front
the
spices
kick
in
quickly
and
dominate
the
taste
from
this
point
onward
mildly
sour
lots
of
effervescence
surprisingly
short
aftertaste
nicely
warming
in
the
throat
and
tummy
overall
a
lot
going
on
the
herbalspice
department
but
not
enough
to
make
me
keep
drinking
good
example
of
the
style
perhaps
just
not
something
i
want
more
of
this
is
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
gruits
so
far
and
a
nice
contrast
to
the
often
darker
siblings
overall
a
very
interesting
concoction
i
appreciated
it
much
more
than
i
liked
it
another
vintage
style
from
the
professor
fritz
briem
series
a
gruit
is
todays
specimen
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
straw
color
with
a
touch
of
white
foam
the
strong
aroma
is
packed
full
of

and
spices
bay

sage
ginger
coriander
and

berries
very
light
and
nimble
on
the
palate
the
flow
is
laced
with
similar
components
to
the
aroma
this
an
unusual
and
tantalizing
brew
i
would
definitely
drink
again
at
first
i
thought
this
might
be
like
drinking
soup
base
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
aromatic
and
gustatory
aspects
of
this
beer
i
repeatedly
thought
how
easily
drinkable
this
was
and
what
an
excellent
apertif
or
dinner
beer
this
would
make
so
its
not
an
overthetop
ris
or
ipa
this
is
still
delicious
and
a
pleasure
while
this
isnt
something
i
see
myself
purchasing
on
any
sort
of
regular
basis
it
was
a
fantastically
interesting
beer
and
unlike
anything
ive
had
before
first
few
sips
were
floral
and
called
to
mind
rosewater
and
coriander
as
the
beer
warmed
a
distinct
spearmint
flavor
emerged
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
with
some
wheatlike
notes
some
ginger
and
other
aromatics
lurk
final
pour
decanted
a
fair
bit
of
unattractive
brown
sediment
o
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
nice
interesting
flavor
i
really
like
the
lemon
citrus
flavor
at
the
beginning
the
spices
are
stronger
than
anything
ive
had
before
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
just
something
i
think
i
have
to
get
used
to
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
cool
interesting
beer
i
think
this
is
a
style
that
a
lot
of
breweries
could
really
use
to
showcase
their
creativity
id
like
to
see
more
of
the
style
i
also
really
like
experiencing
a
beer
that
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
tasting
part
of
history
i
recommend
picking
this
up
even
if
you
dont
really
enjoy
it
although
i
did
it
is
still
worth
the
experience
o
its
probably
the
best
gruit
that
ive
tried
but
i
still
cant
justify
giving
it
a
higher
score
theres
just
too
much
ginger
the
tartness
is
nice
but
ill
take
a
berliner
weiss
over
this
try
it
in
the
end
its
all
lemon
and
im
finishing
it
but
im
not
really
liking
it
quite
refined
nice
for
toasting
or
as
an
apertif
again
this
begs
to
be
paired
i
was
nervous
it
wouldnt
justify
the
price
im
still
not
sure
it
does
but
im
nonetheless
impressed
im
not
sure
id
seek
this
out
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
it
doesnt
really
resemble
beer
as
we
expect
it
but
its
not
bad
paired
with
the
right
foods
it
might
be
a
great
mealaccompanying
beverage
pours

very
light

overall
very

smething
i
would
definitely
have
again
o
d
this
is
pretty
interesting
not
great
but
a
pretty
good
gruit
i
think
the
cpj
o
the
medicinal
quality
of
the
beer
just
threw
me
for
a
loop
i
understand
that
spices
are
a
part
of
what
makes
a
gruit
a
gruit
but
this
beer
was
so
hard
to
drink
hopefully
it
was
only
this
beer
and
not
the
style
that
i
just
dont
like
will
try
to
get
another
gruit
in
the
future
this
is
an
odd
beer
but
worth
a
try
the
alcohol
is
low
and
the
beer
is
light
in
body
for
me
it
is
an
acquired
taste
mainly
because
of
the
anise
i
would
have
to
work
at
acquiring
a
liking
to
it
but
i
would
prefer
it
to
many
ginger
ales
i
think
it
is
a
beer
that
could
pair
well
with
some
foods
while
it
is
a
decent
interpretation
of
an
historical
style
to
me
it
is
more
of
a
novelty
beer
than
one
i
would
seek
out
with
any
regularity
overall
its
quite
nice
and
drinks
very
nicely
its
almost
like
a
dry
cider
in
some
ways

had
too
many
gruits
so
my
experience
is
limited
but
i
like
this
one
very
interesting
array
of
aromas
flavors
and
feel
nothing

overpowering
and
extremely
complex

my
initial
impression
proves
right
for

this

a

good

in

overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
cool
beer
i
like
that
i
got
a
chance
to
drink
an
old
recipe
however
it
seems
a
little
too
much
like
a
basic
ginger
beer
and
im
not
completely
sold
on
the
inclusion
of
the
other
ingredients
listed
because
i
didnt
pick
them
up
maybe
a
different
palate
would
i
enjoyed
the
beer
so
im
going
to
rate
it

is

i

was

to
find

used

its
not

youre
going

this

an

sure

not

enough

can
i

it
yes
would
i
reach
for
one
from

at

no
what
would
it
even
be
doing
at
my
friends
party
overall
its
quite
a
delicious
beer
if
one
that
is
so
far
outside
the
realms
of
expectation
im
so
pleased
to
have
been
able
to
try
this
i
only
wish
i
could
have
tried
a
gruit
from
the
past
when
all
the
ingredients
were
not
only
preservative
but
also
psychotropic
500
ml
german
bottle
with

at
weihenstephan
from
a
base
of
barley
and
wheat
and
spiced
with
bay
leaves
ginger
caraway
anise
rosemary
gentian
and
pollinated
wild
hops
brilliant
pale
gold
color
with
an
inch
of
noisy
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
the
bouquet
starts
with
ginger
and
caraway
and
finishes
with
well
ginger
and
caraway
on
the
palate
there
is
mostly
ginger
and
rosemary
contributing
spice
and
pine
respectively
a
dash
of
malt
is
in
there
as
well
along
with
some
lemon
and
a
slightly
lower
ph
that
helps
keep
the
flavors
bright
its
very
light
very
dry
and
highly
carbonated
body
gives
the
impression
of
tonic
water
i
doubt
that
this
beer
is
in
any
way
historically
accurate
as
i
have
trouble
believing
that
any
beer
brewed
in
the
1200s
including
small
beer
was
this
light
in
color
this
dry
this
lightly
spiced
and
this
cleanly
fermented
however
it
is
possible
that
the
gruit
blend
is
accurate
and
i
applaud
prof
briem
for
at
least
spreading
the
knowledge
of
a
longforgotten
family
of
beers
it
is
no
doubt
approachable
and
easy
to
drink
so
much
so
that
it
could
conceivably
be
a
nice
crossover
beer
for
your
macro
friends
but
i
feel
it
lacks
a
bit
in
character
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
smelled
really
good
if
you
like
a
floral
earthy
beer
it
was
a
light
drinker
that
has
some
nice
twists
to
it
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
for
those
looking
to
experience
beer
of
yore
this
is
a
must
theres
a
lot
going
on
but
its
delicious
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
it
works
well
and
gives
you
a
glimpse
into
beer
geek
palates
of
the
13th
century
and
though
examples
of
the
style
are
quite
rare
we
currently
list
fewer
than
50
on
the
website
this
is
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
gruits
weve
had
todate
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
into
my
chimay
goblet
short
pour
so
not
much
head
but
what
there
was
faded
instantly
and
no
lacing
cloudy
golden
color
with
persistent
bubbles
first
smell
off
the
nose
is
a
massive
whiff
of
mint
a
hint
of
perhaps
belgianish
yeast
some
lemon
rind
on
the
mouth
weird
very
thinly
flavored
tart
as
hell
but
not
full
on
like
a
sour
herbacious
to
the
max
citrus
and
something
pleasantly
medicinal
pretty
thin
bubbly
mouthfeel
i
dunno
this
is
my
first
gruit
i
dont
know
what
to
say
o
overall
i
would
say
this
beer
meets
what
the
brewer
was
trying
to
accomplish
from
what
i
have
read
about
the
style
this
one
fits
perfectly
while
it
would
not
be
my
first
choice
i
would
give
it
a
second
shot
d
interesting
this
is
a
very
light
but
heavily
spiced
beer
the
wheat
flavor
is
fairly
dominant
and
there
is
some
lactic
tartness
that
helps
to
accentuate
this
characteristic
the
spices
are
well
balanced
with
ginger
notes
that
are
significant
enough
to
lend
the
beer
a
little
bit
of
hotness
in
the
finish
this
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
berliner
weisse
but
it
is
something
that
must
be
tried
if
only
once
i
am
looking
forward
to
whatever
the
professor
brews
next
in
this
series
ick
a
very
odd
beer
tastes
like
a
spice
garden
with
a
little
lemon
on
top
the
tastes
are
faint
yet
the
beer
is
not
watery
the
flavors
are
due
to
the
grut
style
of
brewing
there
are
no
hops
used
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
34
inch

of
an
offwhite

decent

wheat

anisenutmeg
slight

hint

and
lemon
citrus
overall
an
unusual
beer
im
not
sure
how
to
rate
this
as
far
as
it
fits
within
the
style
it
had
a
good
blend
body
and
complexity
by
the
way
do
not
swirl
the
remains
of
this
bottle
and
pour
it
in
like
it
was
a
hefe
or
wit
you
may
get
little
chunks
that
look
like
dead
seamonkeys
youre
welcome
drinkability
i
could
drink
glass
after
glass
of
this
all
night
to
be
tried
at
least
once
cant
say
ill
buy
this
again
but
didnt
regret
it
pretty
thin
in
body
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
carbonation
luckily
the
aftertaste
leaves
behind
some
of
the
ginger
and
not
so
much
of
the
medicinal
feeling
if
you
like
the
taste
you
could
probably
drink
this
all
day
but
i
imagine
that
it
would
be
an
acquired
taste
not
one
that
i
plan
on
acquiring
though
im
also
ashamed
to
admit
that
i
passed
on
drinking
the
lees
for
a
change
d
while
i
can
appreciate
the
style
i
think
another
poster
said
it
best
this
is
a
beer
that
would
best
be
shared
with
a
group
of
friends
notes
try
it
to
see
what
its
like
its
worth
having
something
new
that
you
probably
havent
experienced
yet
definately
a
unique
brew
f
semi
bitter
lots
of
light
lingering
spices
which
seem
to
die
rapidly
after
the
nose
more
orange
peel
here
as
well
a
little
anise
more
bay
leaf
and
the
lot
pretty
dry
as
well
with
again
a
touch
of
creamy
malt
and
some
fruit
lingering
d
quite
refreshing
though
the
herbal
funk
does
make
this
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
too
much
of
this
a
nice
venture
into
an
old
and
new
for
me
style
a
little
lower
mark
for
drinkability
however
although
this
was
interesting
and
not
bad
per
se
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
was
ready
to
move
on
one
was
enough
on
a
more
useful
note
when
i
serve
this
to
beer
geeks
which
is
often
i
tell
them
to
think
of
it
as
an
herbal
soda
it
only
remotely
resembles
beer
but
is
supremely
memorable
mindexpanding
and
dare
i
say
delicious
surely
the
best
gruit
i
have
had
to
date
fritz
briem
i
bow
in
your
general
direction
keep
taking
orders
from
the
faeries
and
ill
keep
drinking
this
might
be
worth
trying
to
get
a
good
idea
of
what
beer
was
like
400
years
ago
but
its
not
at
all
drinkable
more
gimmick
than
anything
else
an
intriguing
and
enjoyable
beer
i
will
definitely
take
a
chance
on
other
interpretations
of
the
style
when
i
encounter
them
im
much
more
impressed
with
good
ol
professor
fritz
briems
grut
bier
than
i
anticipated
its
quite
unique
has
an
interesting
flavor
and
a
definite
throwback
feel
to
it
it
does
remind
me
a
sahti
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
if
youre
looking
for
an
interesting
experience
try
this
one
on
for
size
its
a
good
one
thanks
dan
this
beer
is
really
something
special
its
like
im
drinking
some
ancient
medicinal
tonic
quite
refreshing
sehr
grut
herr
professor
refreshing
says
my
wife
and
i
agreealthough
the
weirdly
medicinal
vibe
has
me
wondering
what
illness
i
have
kudos
to
dr
briem
for
keeping
a
centuriesold
tradition
alive
not
one
id
try
again
though
but
hey
nice
aroma
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
unique
beer
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
a
gruit
id
have
guessed
it
was
a
very
smooth
and
well
made
wit
notes
overall
i
find
this
beer
to
be
interesting
complex
and
oddly
delicious
for
me
this
one
pushed
the
limit
of
what
is
and
could
be
all
in
all
and
interesting
drink
but
not
one
i
will
be
rushing
to
revisit
very
hazy
amberyellow
sort
of
color
high
carbonation
level
very
floral
and
spicy
aroma
somewhat
minty
and
grassy
fairly
crisp
upfront
with
a
lot
of
herbal
and
spicy
notes
i
cant
place
the
main
spiceif
i
think
of
it
i
will
edit
my
review
mild
anise
flavor
quite
the
lively
mouthfeel
low
abv
makes
this
somewhat
sessionable
but
the
higher
levl
of
spices
and
floral
notes
might
make
more
then
1
or
2
difficult
for
some
still
an
interesting
beer
and
glad
to
have
tried
it
after
reading
some
favorable
reviews
in
the
press
d
this
tasted
pretty
good
by
itself
and
i
might
have
this
again
the
next
time
i
am
looking
for
an
interesting
change
of
pace
it
might
also
be
interesting
to
pair
with
a
salad
during
dinner
like
gueuze
its
definitely
an
acquired
taste
but
i
am
liking
it
more
with
each
sip
its
also
very
refreshing
and
might
make
for
a
good
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
my
first
time
trying
this

in
the
flavor
profile
thankfully
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
with
an
easy
carbonation
and
some
acidity
at
the
finish
interesting
and
complex
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
went
down
ok
nothing
id
really
chase
again
but
you
wont
hate
this
a
scottish
gruit
from
gemany
not
bad
d
a
sessionable
tasty
brew
i
dont
know
how
traditional
it
can
be
since
it
is
golden
its
nice
to
try
another
example
of
this
rare
style
which
is
one
of
my
favourites
really
different
hard
to
grade
because
it
was
fascinating
if
not
actually
a
great
pleasure
to
drink
the
closest
beer
i
can
liken
it
to
is
orval
though
orval
is
much
more
enjoyable
to
me
glad
i
had
it
cant
say
id
have
it
again
a
concept
beer
pours
a
hazy
lemon
drop
with
at
best
a
finger
of
white
foamy
head
that
doesnt
have
the
drive
to
live
a
long
healthy
life
depression
maybe
i
dunno
when
my
nose
imbibes
the
aura
beneath
it
is
as
though
a
bakers
rack
has
been
spilt
into
a
beer
peppermint
yeah
i
said
peppermint
but
it
could
just
as
easily
be
wintergreen
i
could
never
tell
the
damn
difference
anise
nutmeg
honey
ginger
cinnamon
hops
and
a
melange
of
florals
punch
their
timecards
beginning
their
shift
at
the
olfactory
sorry
i
couldnt
resist
that
pun
at
first
these
workers
are
adrift
in
a
sea
of
vague
bitterness
but
of
course
they
wait
until
after
work
to
let
their
hair
down
at
last
a
wash
of
various
flavors
anise
peppercorn
ginger
honey
nutmeg
and
that
minty
bastard
again
all
dance
toegether
in
such
a
harmony
as
to
make
a
benatton
collection
feel
insecure
enough
to
venture
into
a
walmart
or
something
in
maxs
buddy
bobbys
words
its
pretty
scrumptious
look
it
up
dammit
as
bodies
go
this
one
is
pretty
lithe
and
readily
shows
its
ability
to
glide
through
the
mouth
in
arabesque
of
course
while
not
suffering
from
overeffervescence
dont
you
just
hate
the
overly
bubbly
ones
i
mean
come
on
youve
gotta
get
angry
at
something
am
i
right
guys
overall
id
definitely
partake
in
this
experience
again
if
only
i
knew
how
to
upholster
scents
d
upon
first
wiff
i
was
worried
about
this
beer
then
i
tasted
it
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
i
sort
of
like
it
the
vomit
smell
never
came
through
in
the
taste
nice
beer
this
is
another
beer
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
i
like
trying
unique
things
and
i
wont
hesitate
to
try
other
gruits
in
the
future
i
may
try
this
one
again
after
a
long
day
in
the
sun
with
a
spicy
cold
fruit
soup
some
other
unusual
circumstance
but
im
not
ready
to
go
grab
another
just
yet
not
when
there
are
so
many
others
to
try
d
awesome
this
dr
fritz
briem
who
makes
these
historic
brews
at
weihenstephan
kicks
ass
1809
is
a
real
winner
and
this
is
too
such
an
intriguing
flavor
exotic
yet
familiar
served
in
pint
glass
the
color
of
golden
straw
like
rapunzels
hair
spicyherbal
aroma
initially
picked
up
a
lot
of
ginger
on
the
palate
as
the
beer
warmed
other
flavors
came
out
to
play
like
an
herb
garden
dancing
on
the
tongue
rosemary
bay
anise
and
more
ginger
hints
of
citrus
spritzy
carbonation
quite
refreshing
and
flavorful
pours
very
pale
yellow
with
some
white
yeast
cloudiness
and
much
effervescence
fizzy
large
white
head
subsides
fairly
quickly
no
lacing
the
nose
is
veritable
spice
cabinet
here
ginger
cardamom
clove
and
a
flowery
honeysuckle
sweetness
i
dont
find
the
nose
particularly
appetizing
however
traditional
it
may
be
i
have
had
hopless
beers
that
smell
amazing
in
contrast
the
taste
is
gingery
with
cardamom
and
cloves
malt
sweetness
is
balanced
but
the
spices
makes
it
fairly
crisp
with
a
pleasant
ginger
finish
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
high
level
of
fizzy
carbonation
which
seems
to
complement
the
spicing
interesting
to
try
a
pint
of
this
gruit
thank
you
but
i
have
little
interest
in
revisiting
this
one
i
had
no
idea
what
this
beer
would
be
like
and
am
really
happy
id
buy
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
maybe
its
nothing
more
than
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
the
dipas
ive
been
drinking
but
i
think
not
this
is
a
really
tasty
and
really
unique
beer
that
everyone
should
try
at
least
once
wow
nice
beer
friends
and
i
agree
this
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
the
combination
of
aromas
and
flavors
almost
seem
a
little
lemony
and
pickles
very
refreshing
poured
with
small
white
head
that
lasts
and
no
lace
color
is
a
hazy
light
yellow
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
but
lots
more
going
on
and
really
quite
good
a
lot
of
this
kind
of
beer
im
not
so
partial
to
but
this
works
body
is
very
good
and
great
carbonation
long
finish
of
the
same
flavs
dont
really
think
itd
be
a
session
beer
though
drinkability
i
wasnt
sure
if
id
want
to
finish
this
or
not
but
the
complexity
and
the
act
of
thinking
about
writing
this
review
kept
me
interested
enough
to
do
so
this
isnt
for
everybody
but
i
suspect
if
you
are
a
big
tea
drinker
this
may
be
just
what
you
are
looking
for
especially
if
allowed
to
warm
up
ive
looked
at
this
on
the
shelf
of
the
local
store
for
ages
and
finally
bought
it
the
herbs
are
awesome
especially
in
the
nose
though
it
gets
a
tad
tiring
in
the
taste
either
way
a
solid
and
very
unique
beer
another
thing
about
this
beer
enhancing
its
drinkability
is
the
relatively
low
alcohol
abv
this
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
d
surprisingly
drinkable
light
but
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
very
good
shanty
holy
cow
im
in
love
with
this
beer
d
fun
beer
i
can
see
myself
revisiting
tonights
food
pairing
schnitzel
was
perfect
it
could
go
totally
wrong
with
a
different
dish
though
and
despite
liking
the
taste
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
one
time
to
seek
out
another
flavor
once
youve
gotten
over
the
sensations
this
is
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
i
think
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
there
is
absolutely
no
head
hte
carbonation
is
a
bunch
of
large
bubbles
and
its
steady
it
is
light
yellow
the
lightest
ive
ever
seen
a
beer
and
completely
clear
the
smell
is
of
spice
only
almost
like
chai
tea
interesting
taste
is
sour
and
dry
almost
like
lemon
soda
cloves
anise
rosemary
its
hard
to
drink
not
feeling
this
beer
too
spicy
its
overwhelming
sorry
grut
bier
not
a
repeat
edit
this
is
taking
me
forever
to
gather
my
thoughtspalate
on
this
one
licorice
is
building
as
the
glass
warms
i
dont
like
anise
in
beer
and
this
is
making
it
harder
for
me
overall
a
fantastic
brew
that
might
overwhelm
given
the
mix
of
spices
and
herbs
surely
reminiscent
of
a
potpourri
pot
or
a
kitchen
spice
cabinet
didnt
like
the
body
or
feel
of
this
one
way
overcarbonated
mouthfeel
of
canned
ginger
ale
really
thin
and
watery
and
very
carbonated
i
could
see
this
as
a
lunch
time
beer
with
food
possibly
with
a
turkey
sandwich
or
chicken
salad
wrap
i
found
the
flavors
okay
for
christmas
time
but
any
other
time
of
the
year
the
flavors
would
get
old
fast
a
beer
to
be
consumed
with
christmas
dinner
but
not
really
any
other
time
d
an
airy
tasty
drinkable
beer
great
for
summer
after
trying
a
few
of
the
best
gruits
in
the
world
i
can
unquestionably
say
that
this
one
is
tops
on
my
personal
list
seek
this
out
and
be
prepared
to
taste
something
like
you
have
never
tasted
before
d
this
is
certainly
a
different
beer
that
i
had
to
drink
with
an
open
mind
the
pleasant
herbalism
combined
with
the
low
abv
make
this
beer
go
down
easily
im
really
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
d
refreshing
but
dont
think
i
could
put
up
with
the
different
spices
beyond
a
bottle
glad
i
tried
this
style
of
beer
that
is
not
represented
very
much
on
the
market
i
really
am
trying
to
be
productive
here
the
spices
working
together
in
place
of
normal
ingredients
is
a
nice
try
but
i
really
think
they
ought
to
try
again
i
have
been
hesitant
to
review
things
i
dont
like
on
here
in
the
past
but
a
b
rating
on
ba
for
this
beer
is
calling
into
question
the
integrity
of
the
site
in
my
opinion
so
i
have
sounded
off
people
who
use
this
site
to
find
good
beer
as
i
do
on
occasion
would
be
upset
to
go
by
this
review
in
my
opinion
some
stores
even
print
ba
shelf
talkers
and
i
want
to
have
my
opinion
averaged
in
here
especially
since
i
have
three
other
beer
lovers
who
thought
i
was
being
nice
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
rich
aroma
is
malty
and
just
a
little
bit
fruity
rather
appetizing
flavor
is
mainly
malty
slightly
yeasty
with
an
undertone
of
fruit
and
a
little
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
smooth
fizzy
edgy
texture
helps
it
glide
down
the
pipes
d
different
but
delightfully
so
i
probably
wouldnt
down
several
of
these
back
to
back
however
its
something
i
will
definitely
visit
again
i
dont
know
what
this
is
supposed
to
look
at
its
like
yellow
very
hazy
with
loose
bubbles
and
a
thin
head
looks
a
bit
like
a
mt
dew
or
something
i
cant
say
im
impressed
but
i
cant
say
im
disappointed
im
exited
to
dig
in
to
something
ive
never
seen
before
the
smell
is
what
gets
me
just
incredibly
powerful
on
the
floral
notes
not
hops
but
just
flowers
herbs
maybe
like
rosemary
cardaomom
saffron
cinnamon
coriander
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
exactly
like
i
walked
into
some
kind
of
herb
shop
or
flower
shop
really
out
there
and
not
beery
but
very
pleasant
i
do
get
a
hint
of
sweetness
but
mostly
spiciness
the
taste
continues
with
the
spiciness
but
theres
more
beeriness
to
this
one
i
can
taste
a
nice
light
powdery
maltiness
with
some
pils
malt
flavor
maybe
some
melanoids
then
the
herbal
floral
spicy
flavors
hit
full
force
all
the
things
i
mentioned
before
like
fruity
indian
cooking
almost
or
like
a
really
powerful
and
dry
root
beer
i
cant
say
that
its
my
favorite
drink
on
earth
like
a
strange
tea
that
you
enjoy
drinking
every
once
in
a
while
the
body
is
thin
i
didnt
expect
much
different
but
its
not
watery
theres
enough
to
keep
it
together
nice
carbonation
level
to
bring
the
herbs
to
the
front
overall
it
goes
down
well
clean
a
pleasant
drink
im
not
sure
this
is
a
beer
youd
want
more
than
one
of
but
id
recommend
it
for
an
interesting
drink
i
cant
compare
it
to
others
in
the
style
but
i
would
say
this
is
an
excellent
example
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
and
certainly
fits
the
style
profile
at
least
as
far
as
my
extremely
limited
experience
with
gruit
goes
an
enjoyable
and
educational
brew
but
not
one
i
will
be
drinking
very
often
cool
beer
mouthfeel
was
nicely
zesty
medium
to
light
body
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
although
this
isnt
a
style
that
i
would
normally
drink
this
is
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
in
it
d
very
enjoyable
light
refreshing
and
rejuvenating
one
17oz
bottle
was
perfect
for
me
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
slighly
hazy
with
a
wispy
pure
white
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
herby
some
banana
and
pepper
with
vicks
vaporub
a
bit
bizarre
but
pleasant
the
taste
is
like
a
hefe
spritzer
with
lemon
juice
more
vaporub
action
and
other
various
herbs
a
light
and
very
spritzy
feel
finishes
sweet
and
tart
most
definitely
a
different
brew
but
it
was
enjoyable
very
light
and
refreshing
flavors
are
a
bit
bizarre
but
they
work
together
d
this
beer
has
strong
medicinal
herb
and
soapy
flavors
that
make
it
a
hot
mess
the
herbs
and
spices
all
taste
like
they
are
competing
against
each
other
and
just
make
for
a
strange
cough
drop
in
a
glass
experience
every
ba
owes
it
to
himherself
to
try
this
crazy
shit
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
slight
haze
has
a
good
foamy
white
head
that
evaporates
quickly
i
agree
with
the
bay
leaf
analogy
from
an
earlier
review
the
first
whiff
from
the
bottle
made
me
think
of
bay
rumm
after
shave
the
spice
character
is
the
first
thing
to
hit
you
in
the
aroma
with
the
spicy
hop
notes
and
light
malt
character
coming
in
behind
bay
leaf
rosemary
and
ginger
are
easy
to
pick
up
the
flavor
is
very
light
on
the
palate
with
the
ginger
getting
first
not
and
the
rosemarybay
leaf
showing
up
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
served
chilled
this
still
had
a
marvelous
aroma
and
quenching
mouthfeel
ill
look
for
it
again
this
summer
pours
light
yellow
with
a
whitish
internal
haze
smells
like
bay
leaf
shaving
cologne
mouthfeel
is
both
creamy
and
a
tad
sour
with
fizzy
carbonation
very
interesting
tastes
its
a
sipper
until
i
am
used
to
it
and
then
it
goes
easier
this
brewery
puts
together
some
high
quality
products
quite
interesting
though
and
worth
a
try
to
see
how
perfect
hops
are
for
beer
picked
up
a
bottle
at
four
firkins
pours
a
hazy
bright
yellow
with
a
white
head
im
not
sure
what
the
boundaries
of
the
style
exactly
are
but
certainly
is
a
spiced
beer
its
a
bit
like
a
spiced
wit
of
hefe
in
that
theres
a
lot
of
lemon
ginger
and
pepper
flavors
the
body
is
drinkable
and
the
mellow
bready
malts
are
fairly
smooth
certainly
worth
a
try
for
something
different
in
the
style
a
fun
beer
to
drink
as
things
always
seem
to
be
changing
taste
wise
and
at
4
6
the
flavor
profile
is
intenselots
of
complexity
and
punch
you
in
the
face
flavors
to
boot
just
wish
it
was
prettier
to
look
at
but
i
suppose
there
was
more
to
worry
about
in
the
middle
ages
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
has
some
retention
aroma
is
unique
unlike
any
brew
ive
had
close
to
berliner
weisse
but
way
different
ginger
lemon
and
rosemary
dominate
but
its
a
bbig
salad
of
spice
tastes
like
a
ginger
beer
with
some
mint
mouthwash
and
an
almost
medicinal
aftertaste
like
alka
seltzer
finish
is
somewhat
dry
and
refreshing
not
too
bad
very
drinkable
an
interesting
historical
brew
too
overboard
on
the
spices
for
me
a
beer
to
share
with
a
beer
friend
as
a
conversation
piece
ive
had
gruits
that
were
more
enjoyable
but
this
one
goes
in
a
different
interesting
direction
overall
very
interesting
beer
fruity
carbonated
they
threw
everything
they
could
think
of
in
there
but
the
hops
as
synonymous
with
this
style
overall
this
was
an
intresting
beer
if
you
can
call
it
that
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
though
very
nicely
done
i
could
see
this
fitting
in
quite
well
and
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
leafy
herbal
taste
core
root
beer
spices
without
the
sweetness
mild
popcorn
kernel
all
on
a
soft
bed
of
wheat
so
fresh
smelling
like
fresh
cut
herbs
really
something
unique
its
hard
to
describe
dry
aftertaste
that
has
a
natural
sweetness
to
it
lots
of
character
and
im
at
a
loss
for
words
this
time
its
really
effervescent
and
that
carries
it
along
well
easy
to
finish
the
16
oz
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
medium
sized
fluffy
white
head
with
lots
of
suspended
floaties
throughout
tons
of
spice
and
floral
yeast
esters
make
up

spice
pumpkin

all
spice
banana
bread
white
grapes
and
lemon
zest
crisp
in
body
initially
but
rounded
out
by
a
semisweet
and
coating
toasty
wheat
backbone
lots
of
floral
and
grassy
aromas
and
flavors
going
on
also
herbal
and
slightly
medicinal
different
no
doubt
but
overall
very
pleasant
light
and
refreshing
im
a
fan
of
gruits
but
i
must
say
beers
that
fall
into
this
style
may
not
be
for
everyone
the
aroma
is
nice
and
floral
with
herbs
spices
bread
yeast
ginger
fruit
and
barley
malt
the
appearance
is
cloudy
and
gold
with
a
large
white
head
the
flavor
is
slightly
watery
but
balanced
and
complex
with
a
hefe
like
bubble
gum
clove
and
banana
taste
the
palate
is
thin
but
ok
overall
a
very
very
good
beer
stews
really
a
pleasant
beer
with
great
restraint
in
the
uses
of
the
spices
could
easily
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
its
different
its
interesting
and
its
even
refreshing
a
fine
way
to
revisit
the
oft
overlooked
13th
century
now
i
look
forward
to
a
beer
representing
the
protestant
reformation
of
the
15th
and
16th
centuries
d
an
interesting
beer
from
an
interesting
style
another
solid
beer
from
this
great
brewery
recommended
surprisingly
pleasant
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
white
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
ring
and
film
across
the
beer
with
a
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
is
quite
intense
with
rosemary
and
ginger
the
flavor
is
not
quite
as
intense
as
the
aroma
but
displays
many
of
the
same
characters
along
with
a
bit
of
citrusy
notes
and
various
other
herbs
the
body
is
light
with
lively
carbonation
overall
a
fairly
refreshing
beer
and
the
herbs
are
fairly
balanced
nevertheless
the
spices
would
keep
this
from
being
drank
on
a
regular
basis
from
a
brown
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
not
the
prettiest
to
look
at
smells
of
flowers
spices
cloves
below
average
carbonation
and
light
on
the
lacing
first
sip
is
very
complex
with
flowey
spices
and
herbs
all
making
their
presence
known
tastes
like
patchouli
or
the
inside
of
a
grateful
dead
concert
a
very
interesting
beer
it
is
one
the
wives
will
enjoy
as
well
turbid
milky
lemon
juice
color
with
a
thin
white
head
aromas
of
citrus
and
ginger
first
taste
brought
the
words
childhood
nature
hike
into
my
head
then
i
thought
of
a
dirty
lemon
lollipop
then
i
tasted
the
ginger
rosemary
and
some
caraway
on
the
finish
kinda
light
bodied
i
have
to
seriously
doubt
they
had
a
beer
this
light
in
color
in
the
13th
century
still
its
an
interesting
drink
this
is
actually
quite
refreshing
this
would
be
an
awesome
aperitif
it
gets
the
juices
flowing
and
you
ready
for
a
meal
gruit
beers
are
novel
enough
that
this
beer
gets
props
for
being
unique
i
definitely
enjoy
tasting
modern
interpretations
of
history
i
do
like
the
mix
of
flavors
that
the
specific
herbs
contribute
to
this
beer
very
drinkable
especially
with
lean
red
meat
d
the
ale
is
quite
low
and
the
cardamom
burps
that
im
having
are
quite
enjoyable
pours
a
foggy
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
falls
to
nothing
nose
is
oddly
spiced
and
floral
very
different
flavor
is
twice
as
strange
weird
mix
of
herbs
and
spices
with
a
mild
sweet
fruity
tone
to
it
feel
has
a
lower
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
okay
this
is
a
strange
beer
try
it
once
if
youre
daring
but
dont
really
go
for
it
if
your
palate
isnt
ready
for
some
strange
vibrations
d
this
is
one
tasty
gruit
which
seems
like
a
chameleon
of
a
style
the
spice
blend
w
the
slight
sour
flavor
is
intriguing
and
the
drinkability
is
very
high
for
me
i
could
return
to
this
multiple
times
since
it
is
not
a
boring
or
bland
beer
the
closest
thing
i
have
tasted
to
this
is
troegs
scratch
10
but
that
is
hopped
it
just
has
a
serious
amount
of
anise
this
gruit
is
mellower
but
just
as
tasty
overall
pretty
nice
interesting
nice
floral
flowery
components
but
not
amazing
overall
a
different
beer
thats
worth
drinking
for
the
experience
mostly
clear
medium
golden
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
with
moderate
retention
lemony
herbal
nose
that
reminds
me
of
honey
lemon
cough
drops
light
clove
and
pepper
with
a
hint
of
sweet
honey
like
malt
underneath
the
flavor
is
quite
clovey
with
light
sweet
honey
like
malt
and
hints
of
lemon
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
really
not
my
thing
overall
interesting
but
weird
more
of
a
late
spring
beer
when
its
hot
to
sit
outside
and
enjoy
with
friends
drinking
this
entire
bottle
will
be
a
chore
its
interesting
and
fun
but
not
more
than
a
glass
feels
like
a
mystic
saison
pumped
up
with
lemon
balm
and
flowers
maybe
that
is
what
it
is
it
all
works
out
for
me
and
i
find
the
flavors
balance
out
and
compliment
each
other
smelled
like
toothpaste
nice
juniper
taste

draught
brewery
stopped
here
after
the
granite
state
growler
tour
this
one
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
there
was
almost
no
head
or
lacing
with
this
one
it
has
an
interesting
nose
earthy
definitely
get
some
juniper
and
faint
heather
the
taste
is
good
malty
with
no
real
hops
noticeable
no
real
sweetness
either
some
juniper
unique
and
very
good
poured
from
a
32oz
growler
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
medium
amber
with
a
fair
amount
of
haze
to
it
next
to
no
head
when
poured
and
nothing
shortly
there
after
a
few
small
occasional
streams
of
bubbles
rose
from
the
sidesbottom
the
aroma
was
a
bit
strange
had
a
definite
herbal
smell
but
reminded
me
of
tuna
fish
flavor
was
surprisingly
sweet
and
balanced
some
unherbal
flavors
up
front
but
then
shifted
to
a
berry
flavor
but
not
overly
sweet
coated
the
mouth
nicely
not
that
much
carbonation
however
overall
not
bad
aroma
was
a
kick
in
the
face
but
the
flavor
more
than
made
up
for
it
cloudy
amber
pour
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
minimal
retention
and
lacing
herbal
aroma
notes
of
pine
and
meadow
grass
taste
reflected
the
scent
with
a
bready
malt
base
pine
needles
juniper
berries
making
an
appearance
but
not
overwhelming
anything
herbal
and
earthy
and
something
almost
woody
in
there
as
well
medium
body
lower
carbonation
and
a
nice
beer
overall
the
beer
pours
like
murky
swamp
water
a
gross
yellowed
brown
almost
like
cider
a
light
white
head
forms
and
fizzes
away
leaving
a
slight
headscrim
behind
the
body
is
as
i
have
already
said
murky
and
indiscernible
honestly
if
this
werent
a
gruit
i
would
say
it
was
an
ugly
beer
but
it
being
what
it
is
it
just
looks
fascinating
on
the
nose
this
beer
is
light
and
earthy
with
some
great
candy
bread
scents
and
a
nice
earthy
must
that
i
assume
is
heather
tips
and
juniper
berries
almost
sweet
caramel
is
also
present
and
as
i
push
my
nose
more
into
it
and
let
the
beer
warm
up
i
get
more
of
a
smell
that
is
earthy
and
enticing
in
taste
the
beer
begins
with
light
sweet
bread
and
then
opens
into
spicy
bread
and
herb
notes
the
taste
feels
fresh
and
herbal
with
a
slight
minty
tingle
in
the
aftertaste
but
still
very
strong
earthy
bread
notes
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
notice
that
the
minty
fresh
flavor
actually
is
their
throughout
the
sip
lying
below
the
more
forward
flavors
of
the
beer
and
adding
a
crisp
refreshing
bite
to
the
beer
that
does
give
slight
sweet
berry
notes
as
the
beer
warms
up
i
note
caramelly
sweet
notes
and
very
slight
roasted
flavors
lingering
in
the
flavor
on
the
mouth
this
beer
is
thin
and
highly
drinkable
crisply
kissing
the
tongue
to
refresh
it
and
leaving
the
mouth
only
slightly
wet
with
saliva
but
overall
clean
and
refreshing
im
not
sure
if
it
is
the
thought
that
i
am
drinking
an
herbal
beer
or
if
its
the
actual
beer
but
i
feel
a
lot
of
the
tingling
healthy
affect
that
herbal
tea
imparts
on
my
mouth
which
is
superbly
refreshing
and
highly
fantastic
in
a
beer
earth
eagle
is
a
new
brewery
that
is
specializing
in
brewing
though
not
exclusively
gruits
which
are
superb
and
i
am
really
excited
to
see
what
they
do
with
them
william
wallace
is
a
fantastic
start
to
their
gruit
brewing
and
i
am
really
excited
to
see
where
they
go
from
here
i
may
be
stepping
ahead
of
myself
but
i
feel
this
brewery
may
be
one
of
the
major
starts
of
the
american
gruit
style
and
i
am
excited
to
see
where
it
goes
overall
this
beer
is
terrifically
drinkable
refreshing
and
an
all
around
great
beer
a
wonder
gruit
for
sure
overall
its
enjoyable
enough
to
try
but
i
wasnt
compelled
to
drink
more
overall
i
dont
know
much
about
this
style
or
its
ingredients
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
props
to
spiteful
for
attempting
such
a
rare
style
and
in
my
opinion
executing
it
very
well
tired
of
the
endless
cycle
of
ipas
and
big
beers
this
is
a
brew
for
you
NA
long
finish
good
floral
gruitness
up
front
and
in
the
middle
of
the
mouth
juniper
berries
really
stick
out
great
sourness
maybe
a
bit
of
saltiness
on
the
back
end
this
is
eating
the
enamel
off
my
teeth
i
see
gruit
and
i
think
something
herbal
and
uncommonly
spicy
and
earthy
but
this
really
came
off
more
as
a
wild
saison
or
something
along
those
lines
i
almost
want
to
detract
points
from
the
overall
category
in
that
this
was
not
a
typical
gruit
in
any
way
but
instead
ill
just
say
this
was
not
your
typical
gruit
my
question
is
were
hops
or
herbs
used
in
this
and
what
variety
de
garde
has
improved
by
an
unreal
amount
in
the
past
68
months
with
their
beers
having
evolved
from
glorious
messy
exercises
to
focused
and
welldefined
beers
comparing
the
two
is
like
an
exercise
in
comparing
early
messy
darkthrone
to
later
day
emperor
oanother
wonderful
de
garde
beer
very
thankful
i
was
able
to
try
it
overall
just
another

highly
recommend
this
brew
kudos
to
trevor
for
working
with
this
style
o
overall
i
like
the
complexity
of
this
beer
compared
to
the
more
singular
intense
fruit
of
most
of
the
bu
variants
but
it
lacks
a
bit
of
drinkability
due
to
the
high
acidity
normally
i
can
down
a
750
of
most
de
garde
beers
without
any
problem
but
this
one
is
a
bit
of
work
pretty
damn
exceptional

the
tart

but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
another
beer
that
got
better
as
it
began
to
open
up
a
little
and
is
one
that
i
quite
enjoyed
from
that
stage
on
there
was
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
malts
and
herbs
that
worked
well
together
and
overall
there
was
a
good
balance
with
the
beer
probably
not
one
to
go
back
to
all
that
often
but
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
have
again
if
it
was
on
offer
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
it
doesnt
set
my
world
alight
and
ill
not
be
seeking
out
another
at
first
the
rather
acrid
flavour
reminds
me
of
heather
beer
but
as
this
herbal
flavour
wanes
a
subtle
sweet
strangely
pleasant
element
holds
sway
for
a
while
that
while
ensures
this
is
very
a
much
sipper
rich
caramel
malt
that
leans
to
the
sweeter
side
the
hop
is
here
in
the
taste
but
only
as
a
peppery
spice
great
balance
to
lamb
im
having
rich
body
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
malted
milk
ball
aftertaste
with
white
pepper
from
the
hop
d
pretty
standard
for
a
gruit
not
bad
for
what
it
is
but
the
strange
herbal
flavors
and
muddy
malt
character
keep
it
from
being
anything
more
than
a
novelty
in
many
ways
this
is
more
like
a
soup
than
a
beer
probably
not
something
that
i
would
drink
again
nice
on
the
tongue
and
easy
to
drink
despite
the
somewhat
bitter
flavour
md
the
texture
is
slightly
tainted
by
the
sharply
fizzy
swallow
and
looselycomposed
carbonation
in
its
aftermath
hence
slightly
waterythin
and
unsuitable
for
the
overall
decent
moderate
flavour
that
said
a
pretty
interesting
mixture
is
arrived
at
on
the
palate
much
more
likeable
than
the
cloying
aroma
showing
a
clear
structure
from
light
malts
leading
to
deepening
bitterness
with
the
unusual
ingredients
chiming
in
harmoniously
as
neither
ginger
nor
thistles
comes
too
much
overall
interesting
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
but
i
cant
help
feel
this
could
have
been
great
instead
it
is
a
nice
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
500ml
bottle
according
to
the
label
bittered
by
the
addition
of
thistle
nice
looking
bronzereddish
amber
beer
with
a
thick
creamy
light
tan
head
lightly
floral
aromas
but
mostly
malty
very
malty
flavour
but
somehow
it
comes
across
my
palate
as
creamy
toffeeish
hints
pretty
heavy
floral
thistle
aspectssemidry
with
some
fruitiness
also
good
mouthfeel
pretty
smooth
and
tasty
i
liked
this
it
is
indeed
an
unusual
ale
i
would
certainlly
have
it
again
never
seen
a
dark
gruit
before
this
one
a
huge
lavender
and
rosemary
nose
on
this
brown
looking
ale
with
an
enormous
cream
froth
head
for
an
unhopped
beer
i
taste
way
more
pune
than
other
herbs
in
it
though
presumably
from
the
rosemary
real
long
taste
herbal
almost
like
green
tea
a
little
floral
nice
chocolate
malt
on
it
too
not
used
to
any
real
grain
character
in
the
style
but
its
such
a
great
change
of
pace
piney
as
anything
for
no
hops
drinkable
too
this
is
a
beer
for
the
adventurous
palate
no
doubt
but
a
reward
worth
having
for
sure
not
sure
how
to
rate
to
style
here
but
given
the
product
as
it
is
its
not
too
impressive
in
the
long
run
definitely
worth
consuming
for
novelty
purposes
and
while
the
flavors
are
seriously
well
placed
its
simply
too
thin
tannic
and
not
as
hearty
as
desired
would
love
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
however
this
is
quite
a
dark
gruit
heather
abounds
on
the
nose
flavor
is
quite
deep
much
richer
and
less
light
than
the
few
other
gruits
i
have
had
but
hey
what
do
i
know
pretty
smooth
nice
subtle
herbal
tones
but
nothing
really
comes
at
you
at
100mph
smooth
and
easy
drinking
definitely
a
good
stab
at
a
rarely
touched
style
cheers
and
i
look
foward
to
enjoying
it
again
in
the
future
i
realize
this
beer
has
a
ratings
across
the
board
but
i
just
cant
see
ever
sitting
down
and
drinking
16oz
of
this
at
a
time
3oz
fine
but
it
just
got
tedious
maybe
in
due
time
ill
appreciate
gruit
more
but
its
really
just
a
neat
little
oddity
at
this
stage
of
my
beer
advocacy
note
weekapaug
gruit
is
still
being
brewedas
of
summer
2011
at
least
smoky
herbal
aroma
sort
of
like
scotch
whisky
and
stoutlike
at
the
same
time
oddly
complex
and
unusual
flavors
of
sweet
honeyed
malt
indian
spices
cookies
currants
tea
and
possibly
juniper
lending
a
botanical
impression
smooth
feel
medium
bodied
and
lightly
bitter
overall
its
rather
unique
and
worth
trying
a
pint
of
this
oddity
for
sure
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
mix
of
spices
that
all
balanced
out
very
well
and
tasted
much
more
rich
and
complex
than
most
other
herbal
ales
at
a
bar
with
6
cask
beers
available
we
went
home
with
a
growler
of
the
gruit
the
smell
is
very
good
bringing
all
sorts
of
herbs
and
spices
the
brings
a
touch
of
fruit
underlining
the
herbal
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
spicy
and
pleasing
drinkability
a
tasty
beer
for
a
change
of
pace
i
visited
the
magnolia
brewery
while
in
palo
alto
recently
and
was
absolutely
blown
away
as
a
beer
journal
keeper
with
over
400
beers
under
my
belt
i
was
simply
shocked
that
one
brewpub
could
offer
so
many
amazing
selections
the
gruit
was
quite
possibly
the
best
of
their
offerings
it
is
light
yellow
with
a
slight
red
undertone
the
gruit
is
brewed
with
rosemary
and
other
obscure
herbs
in
the
15th
century
tradition
this
beer
is
a
seasonal
brew
at
magnolia
and
was
offered
on
cask
the
gruit
has
a
light
head
that
is
mostly
creamy
trails
across
the
top
and
the
taste
is
simply
immaculate
this
drink
tastes
like
what
i
imagine
the
ale
in
tolkeins
shire
was
like
the
taste
and
smell
are
both
very
fresh
and
herblike
simply
smelling
rosemary
will
give
it
away
this
beer
is
nothing
like
coriander
flavored
ales
that
are
still
brewed
with
hops
like
traquair
and
is
much
better
it
drinks
very
easily
and
feels
very
smooth
and
full
in
your
mouth
with
a
slight
fruitiness
it
is
best
very
cold
and
the
cask
was
responsible
for
amazing
smothness
a
truly
unique
offering
we
went
back
for
more
before
leaving
town
o
very
forgettable
cheers
lampertland
o
well
its
not
my
bag
but
it
was
certainly
flavourful
that
being
said
it
wasnt
all
that
complex
so
probably
not
the
best
of
the
style
overall
this
beer
doesnt
have
any
crazy
features
but
very
refreshing
and
the
natural
favors
blend
well
together
worth
a
try
if
your
in
victoria
i
had
heatherdale
ale
at
the
gcbf
in
victoria
it
pours
with
a
substantial
but
small
amount
of
head
the
carbonation
is
quite
low
making
it
light
enough
to
drink
a
few
it
has
a
light
golden
color
to
it
i
was
skeptical
about
this
ale
at
first
heather
flowers
in
a
light
ale
did
not
seem
to
appealing
the
smell
was
amazing
thought
it
had
aromas
of
piney
hops
a
delicate
malt
aroma
and
a
flora
smell
that
had
a
slight
rose
aroma
to
it
the
taste
was
multilayered
and
was
delicate
the
taste
began
with
a
smooth
malt
body
which
leads
to
a
floral
piney
hop
flavor
which
leads
into
the
heather
flowers
the
flowers
give
it
a
natural
almost
sweet
and
sour
taste
to
it
that
made
the
beer
very
unique
and
tasty
its
a
shame
it
is
only
available
at
b
gardens
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
to
try
it
go
for
it
infused
with
the
aroma
of
heather
flowers
from
the
butchart
gardens
mild
with
a
floral
aroma
id
love
to
brew
this
beer
overall
a
good
beer
in
the
style
traditional
ale
old
gruit
o
this
is
a
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
gruit
beer
that
is
also
a
little
more
fuller
bodied
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
no
head
and
a
touch
of
sediment
the
nose
is
tame
with
a
caramel
sweetness
and
no
distinct
herbal
characteristics
the
taste
is
a
mellow
brown
ale
sweet
raisins
upfront
with
a
nondistinct
lingering
herbal
finish
the
herbal
flavors
are
slightly
tomatoy
with
a
slowly
building
lingering
tangy
metallic
finish
the
beer
is
lightmedium
bodied
characterized
as
being
sweet
weakly
herbal
drinkable
and
completely
uncarbonated
there
is
very
little
bitterness
this
is
a
drinkable
gruit
but
i
would
have
liked
to
try
it
fresh
as
the
carbonation
and
herbal
pop
were
both
missing
i
had
this
beer
before
and
remembered
it
to
be
good
but
in
fact
it
is
really
good
excellent
i
usually
criticize
the
jopen
brewery
for
having
too
many
different
types
that
are
all
somehow
special
but
not
really
balanced
and
just
not
great
however
with
this
recipe
from
1407
they
are
doing
everything
right
750
ml
bottle
into
tulip
glass
18ic
bottle
code
pours
very
hazy
and
cloudy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
foamy
khaki
head
with
poor
retention
that
reduces
to
a
ring
of
lace
no
lacing
at
all
on
the
glass
aromas
of
apple
skin
pear
caramel
raisin
molasses
herbal
floral
pepper
clove
earth
anise
and
yeast
spiciness
very
nice
and
interesting
aromas
with
good
balance
and
complexity
really
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
taste
of
big
apple
pear
pepper
caramel
toast
molasses
raisin
herbal
floral
earth
clove
and
yeast
spiciness
lingering
notes
of
light

raisin

on
the

for
a
good
bit
very
nice

good
maltspice

almost
zero
cloying
flavors
present
on
the
finish
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
medium
body
with
a
fairly
slick
prickly
and
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
imperial
gruit
ale
this
was
very
interesting
and
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
it
there
is
nice
flavor
complexity
and
balance
and
it
is
quite
smooth
to
sip
on
very
enjoyable
and
unique
offering
o
like
ive
mentioned
10
times
sodacola
like
its
very
nice
although
barely
resembles
a
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
amber
minimal
head
and
no
lacing
nice
dark
belgian
aroma
tasty
dark
malts
with
nutty
flavors
dark
fruit
and
unidentifiable
but
pleasant
herbs
nice
malty
middle
and
finish
medium
bodied
with
creaminsess
delicious
i
really
like
this
beer
excellently
integrated
and
wonderful
o
this
is
a
great
blend
of
characters
with
some
faint
flanders
red
hints
and
some
nice
bock
qualities
all
come
together
if
i
would
have
seen
the
date
before
i
bought
it
i
would
have
passed
on
it
but
it
was
quite
a
surprise
to
taste
this
good
given
the
age
on
it
o
a
very
cool
and
different
beer
the
spices
are
very
present
and
do
their
job
well
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
maybe
a
little
too
strong
and
would
benefit
at
least
drinkabilitywise
from
being
brewed
to
a
lower
gravity
not
sure
if
ill
be
revisiting
it
any
time
soon
but
it
was
definitely
worth
trying
you
should
try
this
one
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
didnt
think
id
drink
the
whole
750ml
bottle
but
i
did
exceptional
example
of
what
a
gruit
style
has
to
offer
i
was
told
that
it
is
a
15th
century
recipe
if
this
is
what
beer
was
like
before
hops
then
i
say
burn
the
hop
crops
and
start
growing
herbs
d
i
really
liked
this
beer
first
gruit
beer
ive
had
so
its
hard
to
judge
but
i
liked
it
would
love
to
buy
again
bottle
was
a
gusher
and
lost
about
40
poured
with
large
tan
head
and
good
lace
color
is
a
hazy
medium
amber
aroma
is
a
slightly
sour
yeasty
malty
spicey
and
bitter
belgian
style
flavors
about
the
same
decent
body
and
carbonation
slightly
boozy
at
the
end
much
better
than
the
other
italian
chestnut
beer
i
just
had
but
thats
not
saying
a
lot
d
very
drinkable
and
a
very
original
one
like
a
good
dark
trappistabbey
beer
with
a
pinch
of
extraordinairy
herbs
will
keep
this
one
in
stock
overall
a
very
good
beer
not
comparable
to
anything
i
had
before
i
read
it
is
not
brewed
with
hops
in
antoher
review
but
with
herbs
the
resulting
spicy
smell
and
taste
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
cough
syrup
but
than
the
nice
one
you
cant
stop
drinking
a
must
try
nice
gruit
from
jopen
pours
a
rich
mahogany
with
a
tna
head
nose
has
a
nice
collection
of
herbs
along
with
nutty
malts
taste
also
has
a
nice
grain
profile
but
the
spice
presence
is
a
bit
dull
medium
to
full
body
carbonation
a
bit
high
good
example
of
the
style
d
its
interesting
to
try
this
one
and
imagine
what
people
would
think
of
it
6
centuries
ago
3
5
m3
d
slightly
stimulating
initially
but
overall
quite
smooth
the
body
is
too
thin
and
flavour
too
simple
and
timid
compared
with
the
promising
aroma
i
wonder
if
its
meant
to
be
like
this
and
perhaps
that
its
nearing
the
bb
date
has
to
do
with
the
lack
of
spicy
intervention
on
the
palate
and
in
the
aftertaste
its
an
interesting
brew
all
the
same
though
my
curiosity
and
interest
stops
with
this
bottle
at
2
5pounds
a
bottle
sweetness
almost
approaches
cloying
but
overall
remains
quite
drinkable
esp
with
something
like
thymepeppergarlic
seasoned
lamb
chops
the
taste
is
of
carameltoffee
with
spicy
earthy
bitterness
and
without
hops
anise
nutmeg
cinnamon
spiciness
blends
so
well
and
mesh
with
the
toffeeish
malt
yet
stops
short
of
being
overspiced
and
allows
the
maltiness
to
dominate
but
in
a
balanced
way
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
in
taste
though
becomes
quite
warming
after
halfway
through
the
750
bottle
earthy
complex
yet
not
overwhelming
with
a
nice
maltiness
it
has
a
creamy
medium
to
full
body
drinks
dangerously
smoothly
though
slows
down
to
a
very
sippable
sipper
this
is
unique
interesting
and
welldone
recommended
i
can
definitely
see
this
being
a
beer
with
quite
a
history
id
be
curious
to
know
how
close
this
comes
to
the
original
versions
unique
i
like
that
d
i
split
the
750
ml
bottle
with
my
wife
i
would
have
finished
the
bottle
if
i
were
on
my
own
ill
definitely
try
this
one
again
d
i
really
enjoyed
everything
about
this
beer
it
made
me
come
back
for
more
early
and
often
the
jopen
pours
a
nice
ruby
brown
mix
and
tops
off
with
a
nice
thick
three
finger
head
the
smell
was
strong
it
consisted
of
fruit
herbs
and
spices
the
taste
was
of
berries
spices
herbs
and
slight
after
notes
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
flavors
explode
on
the
palate
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
little
carbonation
i
would
definitely
go
for
this
again
taste
is
of
alcohol
not
wellhidden
some
sense
of
dark
sweet
fruity
malt
and
a
peripheral
taste
of
the
cinnamon
from
the
nose
aside
from
the
alcohol
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
the
8
5
should
be
better
masked
taste
is
caramel
tobacco
candy
sweets
and
slightly
sweet
a
good
maltiness
and
some
flowery
and
spicy
tastes
could
this
be
the
gagel
that
i
taste
i
dont
know
how
this
tastes
but
for
me
it
is
clear
that
this
beer
is
really
something
special
the
other
tastes
in
here
are
so
special
that
i
dont
know
where
they
are
coming
from
but
i
dont
mind
taste
is
good
drinkability
im
convinced
i
got
a
bad
bottle
will
try
to
review
again
another
time
drinkability
as
far
as
gruits
go
this
one
seems
to
me
more
artificial
actually
it
makes
me
rethink
how
well
crafted
earlier
gruits
might
truly
have
been
worth
a
try
just
for
the
history
but
also
enjoyable
even
for
a
hophead
like
me
alcohol
content
is
not
obvious
but
builds
up
a
nice
warmth
over
the
course
of
a
bottle
not
the
best
example
of
a
true
gruit
that
ive
ever
had
more
like
a
belgian
ale
still
ill
recommend
this
as
a
suitable
starter
beer
for
those
intimidated
by
heavily
spiced
concoctions
makes
room
for
depth
and
complexity
while
offering
a
solid
malty
brew
in
the
background
good
wine
colour
with
a
little
lace
light
mouthfeel
aged
past
expiry
by
eight
months
and
still
quite
drinkable
and
likely
mellowed

remove

drinkability
i
would
not
want
drink
another
bottle
until
2
hours
after
i
had
the
first
this
would
be
a
good
after
dinner
beer
to
have
by
itself
pours
a
deep
burgundy
with
a
big
fluffy
off
white
headwow
the
aromas
are
quite
a
treat
cinnamon
and
clove
dominate
with
a
nice
underlying
cherry
fruitiness
both
intermingle
very
well
together
seems
to
be
quite
complexnutmeg
and
cloves
really
show
up
with
a
real
grape
juice
flavor
showing
up
with
just
a
hint
of
green
herbs
in
the
finish
i
have
to
say
i
have
never
had
a
beer
taste
so
much
like
grape
before
it
was
rather
pleasant
my
second
gruit
and
i
really
enoyed
this
one
my
first
gruit
and
i
wasnt
let
down
very
interesting
and
amazing
considering
the
absence
of
hops
amber
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
nose
is
a
blend
of
fruit
wine
malt
and
grassy
elements
very
nice
tatse
is
excellent
malt
and
alcohol
on
the
front
belnding
into
a
lightly
biiter
finish
mouthfeel
is
suprising
light
for
the
high
abv
very
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
considering
the
high
abv
also
some
qualities
of
a
double
but
without
the
abundance
of
portwine
like
qualities
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
too
bad
for
for
foam
and
mouthfeel
but
all
in
all
most
certainly
one
i
go
for
again
very
slick
in
feel
and
flavor
rich
in
taste
and
texture
full
in
body
and
character
damnit
i
like
it
dont
care
what
you
say
im
an
unabashed
fan
of
thisstuff
and
you
can
cuff
me
if
you
like
ill
still
sing
it
on
high
and
try
to
procure

personal
consumption

to

after
this

was
passed
over
several
times
it
finally
hit
the
basket
for
the
ride
home
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
its
a
murky
reddishbrown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
disappears
almost
immediately
its
not
the
most
inviting
looking
beer
in
the
world
however
its
modest
appearance
is
more
than
made
up
for
by
the
smell

taste
gentle

smells
are
backed
up
by
a
very
nice

the
taste
strikes
an
intriguing
balance
of

sweetness
and
medicinal
herbs
the
8
5
abv
isnt
immediately
apparent
in
the
taste
but
a
pleasant
and
slowly
developing
warmth
announces
the
alcohols
presence
its
not
an
everyday
beer
but
it
certainly
is
worth
a
try

this

the

as
well
but
this
beer
is
not

it
the

quite
muted
i
cant
pick
out
any
individual
contributions
there
is
no
real
balancing
bitterness
here
though
there
is
perhaps
a
light
astringency
in
the
finish
this
is
predominantly
a
fruity
tasting
beer
it
tastes
like
a
cross
between
a
fruit
cake
and
a
spice
cake
this
would
be
an
appropriate
beer
for
a
cold
winter
evening
i
had
this
on
tap
in
amsterdam
i
remember
it
being
darker
and
a
more
intense
this
bottled
version
was
still
an
experience
it
is
a
clear
brown
with
a
head
that
dissipates
fast
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
earthy
the
medioum
body
is
malty
and
has
some
fruitiness
with
some
sweetness
up
front
it
finishes
with
a
peppery
dryness
i
really
liked
this
gruit
it
is
not
the
first
hopless
beer
that
i
have
tried
but
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
it
is
excellent
for
a
cold
winter
night
overall
this
is
an
amazingly
interesting
and
complex
beer
considering
that
it
has
no
hops
hey
if
medievil
beer
was
like
this
send
me
back
in
time
beer
poured
with
a
tan
rocky
head
that
resembled
hardened
molded
foam
the
beer
itself
was
cloudy
and
reddish
amber
the
nose
consisted
of
fresh
granny
smith
apples
but
in
a
dusty
cellar
kind
of
way
some
brambly
berries
emerge
both
in
flavor
and
tartness
as
the
beer
warms
the
alcohol
becomes
apparent
too
it
certainly
was
herbal
in
a
wonderful
kind
of
way
nothing
too
overthetop
like
once
could
easlity
imagine
a
gruit
being
bready
malt
slightly
fruity
and
a
little
toasty
with
a
tealike
quality
on
the
finish
cant
wait
to
age
this
one
a
very
different
beer
this
is
enjoyable
nonetheless
from
the
start
to
the
finish
this
very
different
in
taste
and
aroma
the
look
is
dark
thick
amber
with
a
nice
tan
head
and
lacing
the
sweetness
is
balanced
here
by
the
fruity
spices
which
appear
in
the
nose
as
well
cherry
sourness
or
rather
tartness
seems
to
play
off
the
maltiness
in
a
way
that
limts
the
malt
power
the
feel
is
different
and
a
bit
hard
to
describe
but
good
just
the
same
limited
drinkability
i
believe
this
to
be
an
infrequent
sipping
beer
perhaps
nicely
paired
with
a
dessert
dish
this
is
a
gruit
brewed
without
hops
it
relies
on
herbs
and
spices
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
cloudy
brownish
in
color
with
a
very
fine
and
creamy
14
tan
head
that
holds
very
very
well
and
leaves
some
good
lace
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
fine
effervescence
that
makes
it
quite
soft
in
the
mouth
the
aroma
is
fairly
full
with
dark
fruit
cherries
tartness
a
lightly
peppery
spiciness
soft
caramel
maltiness
and
some
herbal
qualities
that
i
cant
readily
define
the
herbs
do
give
a
drying
quality
and
the
beer
is
well
rounded
some
fruity
herbal
maltiness
lingers
in
the
finish
but
its
not
sticky
as
the
tartness
balances
it
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
only
emerging
toward
the
end
of
the
serving
a
very
unique
interesting
and
rewarding
beer
quite
enjoyable
much
more
balanced
and
mellow
than
id
expected
absolutely
worth
trying

the

the

very
good
beer
not
incredible
but
for
what
it
is
very
good
citrus
spices
and
herbs
taste
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
nice
example
of
gruit
almost
all
the
gruits
ive
had
havent
been
well
balanced
but
this
one
was
with
the
spices
and
herbs
being
part
of
the
beer
and
not
completely
taking
it
over
it
reminded
me
of
a
spiced
and
herbed
version
of
saison
dupont
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
pretty
crisp
slightly
prickly
very
dry
on
finish
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
a
full
bottle
would
be
my
limit
anymore
than
that
and
it
might
start
to
wear
on
me
a
little
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
there
wasnt
any
aspect
that
was
too
overpowering
and
they
all
seemed
to
work
well
with
each
other
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
it
came
in
a
green
bottle
it
imparted
just
a
very
slight
skunky
aspect
that
didnt
need
to
be
there
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
like
this
which
would
be
around
the
summer
time
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
beers
with
some
balanced
herbs
and
spices
to
it
if
you
like
saison
dupont
then
you
need
to
give
this
beer
a
try
all
in
all
i
way
happy
with
this
beer
it
seemed
to
be
right
in
between
a
gruit
and
sasion
dupont
i
liked
that
this
isnt
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
i
like
saison
dupont
a
little
more
but
it
is
the
best
gruit
that
ive
had
so
far
good
job
guys
this
beer
was
tasty
and
a
little
unique
i
can
appreciate
it
keep
up
the
good
work
overall
unusual
and
yet
incredibly
familiar
id
say
this
is
the
golden
standard
of
how
a
gruit
should
be
done
if
youre
trying
to
make
a
modern
gruit
and
the
herbs
and
spices
take
over
the
flavor
of
the
malt
or
reinvent
the
style
you
were
aiming
for
then
i
feel
like
youve
failed
yes
i
know
gruit
is
listed
as
its
own
style
but
the
definition
varies
i
tend
to
call
it
anything
brewed
without
hops
and
with
other
herbsspices
instead
this
was
well
done
o
delicious
gruit
beer
that
has
become
my
go
to
shift
drink
after
a
long
night
tending
bar
maybe
if
the
spicing
where
more
apparent
it
would
be
more
interesting
they
should
list
the
herbsspices
used
on
their
cervesia
entry
on
the
website
otherwise
what
does
it
matter
whats
in
it
prost
o
good
unusual
in
a
good
way
i
havent
had
many
gruits
id
try
again
though
not
super
often
having
not
had
many
any
gruits
until
now
this
is
difficult
for
me
to
rate
to
style
but
it
is
a
well
crafted
ale
and
strikes
one
as
experimental
yet
conservative
all
at
once
a
good
beer
in
the
leadup
to
valentines
day
a
good
beer
in
general
a
great
gruit
and
not
the
best
purchase
while
saison
dupont
still
exists
o
i
dont
know
why
this
has
such
a
high
score
alba
scots
pine
ale
and
the
fritz
briem
13th
century
are
much
tastier
versions
of
the
style
although
this
is
definitely

and
the

this
is

not

i
will

again

a

ancient

with

a

this
doesnt

like
a
modern

is
enjoyable
as
an
alcoholic

and
is

disappointed
overall
taste
was
something
i
personally
couldnt
get
over
i
like
all
of
the
factors
that
much
malty
smooth
refreshing
reminiscent
of
a
barlywine
but
with
a
fruity
twist
very
interesting
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
like
the
nose
the
berry
and
juicy
fruit
flavors
are
the
main
thing
one
gets
but
then
i
pick
up
those
roasted
malts
mild
bitterness
a
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
the
experience
with
this
style
but
when
done
right
its
a
style
that
i
enjoy
and
after
trying
this
beer
i
have
no
doubt
that
dogfish
head
did
a
good
job
with
this
beer
it
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
not
too
acidic
crisp
the
alcohol
was
hidden
very
well
slightly
refreshing
a
little
creamy
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
dont
think
i
would
have
a
problem
drinking
the
whole
bottle
since
its
not
really
acidic
and
the
alcohol
seemed
to
be
expertly
hidden
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
no
single
aspect
ever
got
too
overpowering
the
balance
was
right
where
it
needed
to
be
what
i
liked
the
lest
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
a
single
thing
about
this
beer
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
might
consider
seeing
how
it
ages
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
or
just
tart
fruity
beers
in
general
its
for
sure
worth
a
try
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
and
a
little
impressed
some
of
these
beers
from
this
ancient
ale
series
were
hit
or
miss
for
me
but
this
one
was
for
sure
a
hit
and
enjoyed
drinking
it
it
exceeded
my
expectations
so
far
its
one
of
the
better
dogfish
head
beers
ive
had
its
now
my
favorite
of
the
style
good
job
guys
this
was
one
tasty
unique
and
interesting
beer
keep
up
all
the
hard
work
definitely
honey
faint
cherry
jolly
rancher
interesting
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
tart
and
sweet
flavors
not
something
i
am
likely
to
try
again
as
the
sweetness
ultimately
limits
its
drinkability
but
i
was
glad
to
have
experienced
it
a
solid
effort
overall
the
berry
and
herb
combination
works
better
than
i
expected
i
dig
the
idea
of
recreating
ancient
recipes
for
the
modern
world
i
m
not
sure
if
id
look
for
this
one
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
once
i
couldve
swore
this
was
listed
as
a
kvass
yesterday
oh
well
o
since
this
is
the
first
kvass
ive
ever
had
theres
no
context
for
it
still
this
is
an
unusual
beer
with
some
great
attributes
a
typically
off
the
wall
dogfish
head
concoction
pours
a
reddish
orange
color
with
a
1
head
that
slowly
falls
the
aroma
is
of
cranberry
and
other
fruits
big
fruity
flavor
as
cranberries
and
other
berries
create
a
nice
flavor
mild
bitterness
overall
alcohol
is
well
hidden
here
slow
sipping
but
refreshing
overall
t
overall
a
balanced
beer
it
tasted
quite
a
bit
like
a
hibiscus
tea
with
hints
of
sweettarts
and
honey
draft
poured
a
reddish
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
berries
and
herbs
is
not
the
most
enticing
taste
was
also
a
weird
mix
between
some
berries
notes
herbs
with
weird
unrefined
grainy
notes
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
interesting
experiment
but
with
such
low
drinkability
i
think
i
will
avoid
in
the
future
orangered
color
good
clarity
a
few
dishwaterlike
bubbles
on
top
but
otherwise
no
head
and
very
little
activity
in
the
glass
overall
indicative
of
low
carbonation
in
the
nose
earthy
wood
stale
fruit
notes
of
cough
syrup
and
solventy
booze
i
actually
said
blech
when
i
took
a
sip
of
this
rotten
fruit
cranberry
jam
cardboard
decomposing
wood
a
medicinal
and
almost
vodka
like
booziness
really
messy
and
the
almost
nonexistent
carbonation
wasnt
helping
the
mouthfeel
either
which
came
off
as
slick
and
lifeless
definitely
couldnt
drink
this
one
so
im
glad
i
only
got
a
sample
at
first
sip
this
played
like
a
sour
the
more
i
drank
the
more
it
seemed
to
open
up
the
cranberry
is
a
bit
more
prominent
than
id
like
but
i
think
that
the
subtle
birch
flavors
play
well
with
the
fruit
good
body
and
quite
smooth
for
how
boozy
it
really
is
im
glad
i
made
the
purchase
but
i
think
one
25oz
bottle
will
be
enough
for
me
initial
reaction
was
nonplussed
at
first
sip
but
it
grew
on
me
more
and
more
theres
a
bracing
grapefruitrindlike
bitterness
on
the
back
end
thats
really
pleasant
and
the
fruit
quite
reserved
but
there
i
kind
of
wish
theyd
skipped
the
cranberries
and
gone
alllingonberry
as
that
wouldve
fit
the
scandinavian
theme
better
herbs
are
well
balanced
hard
to
place
either
dill
seed
or
caraway
maybe
both
in
there
the
more
i
drank
the
more
it
seemed
to
reveal
but
most
important
in
a
chilled
glass
it
was
just
wicked
refreshing
on
a
hot
august
day
good
stuff
o
good
no
doubts
there
gimmicky
yes
a
breakthrough
beer
experiment
no
repeatable
yes
for
a
pretty
conservative
price
should
you
try
it
sure
i
dont
care
for
this
beer
in
the
sense
of
it
being
tasty
and
pleasing
to
drink
i
love
this
beer
in
the
sense
that
dfh
allows
me
to
take
a
journey
back
to
fermented
beverage
history
thanks
for
brewing
as
a
man
of
swedish
heritage
i
must
say
i
was
intrigued
and
excited
by
this
beer
it
poured
as
any
darker
ale
with
little
to
set
it
apart
the
nose
was
nice
with
tinges
of
spice
and
malt
the
flavor
is
what
set
this
apart
as
it
was
reminiscent
of
a
christmas
beer
with
nutmeg
spicy
cinnamon
barley
malt
tea
leaves
prune
date
and
then
a
tangy
cranberry
finish
the
feel
was
a
tad
thin
when
it
comes
to
the
overall
style
i
enjoyed
this
immensely
perhaps
a
touch
jaded
by
the
history
but
it
had
great
flavor
high
in
alcohol
but
the
tartness
counters
well
probably
one
of
the
better
big
beers
from
dogfish
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
pours
a
rich
clear
cranberry
with
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipates
only
aroma
i
could
get
was
faintly
honey
not
liking
honey
this
isnt
a
perk
tastes
mostly
like
carbonated
cranberry
juice
with
a
bit
of
honey
and
a
touch
of
cough
syrup

me

flavors
and
very
smooth

on
for
the
big
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
this
beer
surprised
me
i
expected
a
lambic
tasting
beer
that
would
be
sour
it
has
a
great
balance
of
tart
and
sweetness
that
makes
it
so
delicious
i
definitely
recommend
trying
it
amber
hued
with
good
clarity
a
quarter
inch
head
of
off
white
foam
covers
the
majority
of
the
beer
brussels
lacing
aroma
of
cranberries
and
faint
lingonberries
the
body
is
surprisingly
light
but
a
bit
sticky
the
flavor
is
slightly
tart
cranberries
balanced
with
a
bit
of
sweet
honey
you
can
also
sense
a
light
malt
base
o
overall
a
very
solid
beer
it
has
good
flavors
and
definitely
isnt
your
run
of
the
mill
fruit
beer
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
no
lace
nice
crystal
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
light
fruity
nose
and
flavor
is
tart
fruit
some
sweetness
high
abv
is
hidden
take
out
the
hops
and
it
would
be
close
to
a
wine
pricey
at
14
00
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
o
i
thought
that
this
beer
would
be
quite
tart
with
the
cranberries
and
lingonberries
but
the
honey
helps
to
balance
things
off
and
even
adds
a
bit
of
sweetness
onot
much
besides
cranberries
and
honey
would
have
like
more
subtly
or
flavors
the
taste
is
interesting
with
fruity
cranberry
providing
a
juicy
slight
tangy
taste
with
an
herbal
flavor
and
mild
sweetness
of
the
honey
and
birch
syrup
noticeable
on
the
palate
with
a
sweetsour
complimentary
taste
the
yeast
adds
a
light
hint
of
dryness
with
the
alcohol
as
it
finishes
with
some
fruit
there
after
the
swallow
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
ancient
ale
it
is
kind
of
straddling
the
line
between
mulled
wine
and
beer
with
the
birch
syrup
and
hone
making
for
a
smooth
10
ale
i
recommend
this
for
those
who
like
historic
beers
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
a
little
watery
fairly
flat
or
still
overall
more
a
juice
than
a
beer
but
not
bad
maybe
something
to
surprise
a
friend
who
believes
all
beer
tastes
the
same
the
enjoyable
beer
would
be
most
appreciated
with
summer
salads
feta
cheese
cheesecake
or
bitter
greens
thats
because
as
a
standalone
taste
there
seems
to
be
something
amiss
food
and
good
company
would
provide
answers
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
fruit
beer
not
too
sweet
like
most
fruit
beers
this
strikes
the
right
balance
and
i
could
see
myself
having
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
fact
that
it
is
based
on
an
ancient
scandinavian
brew
is
a
plus
for
me
since
i
am
a
history
buff
surprisingly
clear
dark
orange
with
an
off
white
head
cranberries
on
the
nose
super
tart
and
sugary
sweet
the
beer
feels
smooth
and
balanced
at
first
it
then
takes
on
a
dry
tartness
and
hits
you
with
the
cranberry
which
is
the
beers
most
dominant
flavor
a
very
malty
and
plain
backbone
but
rather
pleasant
and
puts
off
no
off
flavors
the
honey
is
somewhat
there
but
this
beer
is
mostly
about
the
cranberry
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
rather
well
balanced
its
sweet
at
first
and
dry
and
tart
later
a
decent
fruit
beer
and
worth
checking
out
o
overall
sweet
honey
and
tart
cranberry
unique
but
more
of
a
cranberry
beer
then
anything
a
bomber
could
lead
to
quite
the
struggle
once
the
novelty
wears
off
for
the
record
i
picked
this
up
from
a
local
store
which
had
20
bombers
on
closeout
at
3
98
a
price
always
worth
a
curious
buy
when
it
comes
to
dogfish
head
but
dont
expect
to
be
knocked
over
i
understand
the
experimental
aspect
but
overall
if
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
drinking
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
probably
wouldnt
be
to
impressed
o
very
good
fruit
beer
nothing
funky
or
weird
just
a
really
nice
blend
of
some
unique
ingredients
i
think
i
will
put
a
couple
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
or
two
as
they
should
age
well
i
appreciate
the
innovation
beer
and
this
beer
does
start
to
grow
on
you
after
a
little
while
that
being
said
its
still
not
nearly
worth
drinking
considering
the
other
offerings
in
the
style
cool
beer
here
loaded
with
a
bunch
of
unconventional
berries
for
brewing
that
have
stained
it
a
grapefruit
pink
color
and
even
the
head
a
pale
shade
of
pink
the
nose
on
this
is
more
herbal
than
fruity
with
a
lemongrass
vibe
and
a
moderate
acidity
the
flavor
starts
with
berries
but
its
a
bit
thin
the
grain
profile
is
very
light
but
interesting
too
not
sure
what
all
is
in
here
but
its
more
than
wheat
and
pale
malt
i
like
how
ripe
this
is
with
tart
berries
without
being
sweet
at
all
the
grassy
flavors
come
on
in
the
finish
lush
and
well
hopped
for
a
fruited
beer
long
tart
finish
maybe
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
very
interesting
also
the
alcohol
is
superbly
well
disguised
you
cant
get
it
at
all
i
would
have
guess
6
5
abv
not
10
no
way
well
carbonated
and
maybe
a
tad
thin
in
body
i
certainly
like
this
a
lot
and
would
like
to
see
some
of
these
berries
resurface
in
other
beers
i
genuinely
like
these
far
out
dogfish
beers
and
although
they
have
faced
some
criticism
i
think
they
are
moving
brewing
forward
in
a
cool
new
way
overall
neither
too
sugary
nor
is
it
too
tart
or
boozy
add
in
some
appreciated
suds
and
its
one
of
the
better
cranberry
beers
and
one
of
the
more
likable
ancient
ales
from
dfh
overall
well
it
was
definitely
really
unique
and
interesting
to
try
i
did
like
the
tart
berry
notes
really
liked
how
well
the
cranberry
actually
came
through
unlike
most
beers
and
tart
piney
lingonberry
that
really
makes
me
think
juniper
berry
the
birch
sap
led
to
a
pine
forest
note
with
syrupy
flavor
mixing
well
with
the
nice
malt
base
and
honey
to
really
dry
out
the
finish
which
didnt
let
it
get
too
syrupy
or
sticky
but
also
let
the
booze
finally
cut
through
as
it
was
mostly
well
hidden
a
really
interesting
beer
to
try
but
not
sure
if
i
would
really
buy
it
again
but
i
may
want
to
bring
it
to
a
family
event
so
the
finnish
cranberry
farm
side
of
the
family
can
try
it
overall
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
i
have
had
it
does
not
try
to
be
something
else
or
copy
someone
elses
style
it
is
its
one
thing
which
i
love
a
good
representation
or
take
on
an
ancient
ale
and
what
it
should
be
not
aggressive
and
booze
but
soft
subtle
and
tart
o
a
really
nice
fruit
beer
from
dogfish
head
definitely
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
o
nothing
bad
here
and
with
most
of
dogfish
heads
beer
id
recommend
trying
it
i
just
didnt
get
any
of
the
notes
mentioned
on
the
label
and
for
me
it
would
not
be
one
id
seek
out
again
overall
this
is
an
interesting
entry
in
the
ancient
ale
series
instead
of
the
supersweet
boozy
meadwinebeer
hybrids
like
sahtea
jaihu
and
the
like
this
is
a
relatively
crisp
and
tart
brew
that
is
very
interesting
d
this
brew
is
quintessential
dogfish
head
not
great
nor
bad
but
completely
unique
and
challenging
the
aroma
is
the
best
part
of
this
offering
the
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
are
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
the
end
result
is
a
beer
worthy
of
the
curious
probable
a
couple
notches
below
theobroma
in
terms
of
my
favorite
dfh
ancient
ale
low
b
clear
shiny
amber
with
almost
no
head
smells
of
cranberry
booze
and
the
medicine
cabinet
after
a
flood
tastes
of
cranberry
herbal
notes
sweet
syrup
and
warming
booze
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
sweet
but
not
very
interesting
no
reason
to
have
more
than
once
hand
it
to
dogfish
head
to
go
far
out
on
the
craft
beer
limb
with
another
ancient
ale
and
this
one
id
love
to
see
more
of
o
ok
better
then
most
recent
dfh
stuff
lately
o
certainly
unique
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
im
now
ready
for
a
stout
this
is
certainly
very
different
closer
to
wine
than
beer
a
strange
combination
that
they
made
work
but
not
something
i
would
drink
again
overall
excellent
let
a
small
amount
warm
up
in
the
glass
so
the
bouquet
opens
up
as
well
tart
and
bitter
cranberry
and
lingonberry
in
spades
malt
underneath
lingering
bitterness
verges
on
herbal
initially
more
carbonated
though
it
ebbs
away
towards
the
end
it
drinks
more
as
a
gruit
which
is
essentially
what
many
of
these
attempts
at
ancient
ales
are
overall
this
is
interesting
but
not
what
i
would
call
beer
notes
again
bravo
to
dfh
for
pushing
limits
of
beer
and
seemingly
to
always
try
new
things
dfh
kvasir
is
an
acquired
taste
in
a
beer
i
love
trying
unusual
and
anciently
inspired
ales
this
one
was
particularly
good
the
beer
from
a
heavy
750
ml
bottle
is
a
burntcopper
color
clear
with
a
very
fleeting
head
moderate
carbonation
the
aroma
is
rich
with
berries
and
honey
it
smells
like
a
a
fresh
forest
harvest
meaty
berries
wood
herbs
and
very
prominent
honey
the
taste
is
a
bit
tart
followed
with
a
fruity
sweetness
dryish
with
lots
of
flavor
it
has
an
herbal
bitterness
up
front
which
does
not
linger
medium
body
and
lightly
carbonated
very
drinkable
and
it
really
masks
its
abv
odefintely
an
odd
ball
of
a
beer
im
liking
it
a
lot
more
than
many
of
their
other
crazy
750ml
beers
its
not
spectacular
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
unless
youre
the
type
of
person
like
me
that
needs
to
try
every
dfh
beer
at
least
once
it
holds
the
alcohol
well
you
can
barely
taste
it
at
all
probably
the
most
tart
dfh
beer
ive
ever
had
just
another
dogfish
head
fruit
beer
features
the
tart
berries
and
captures
that
tartness
at
a
minor
level
not
very
special
in
actuality
could
be
considered
skippable
amongst
others
in
their
lineup
o
intresting
and
unique
not
my
favorite
ancient
ale
but
not
bad
at
all

aroma
of

is
earthy
bark
and

to
start

cranberry

tartness
with
grape
and
berry
elements
and
finishing
with
tart
cranberry
juice
and
earthy
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
peppery
carbonation
another
very
interesting
reconstructed
beer
that
really
does
taste
as
if
it
were
the
result
of
an
ancient
brewer
experimenting
with
flavors
from
the
nearby
environment
the
profile
of
the
base
beer
is
reminiscent
of
a
light
berliner
weisse
fruity
and
tart
but
the
rustic
herbs
have
an
interesting
woodiness
of
putting
your
tongue
on
an
unfinished
pine
board
woody
without
a
resiny
element
likely
due
to
a
mint
family
herb
like
sage
tart
and
refreshing
with
an
odd
herbal
taste
that
i
enjoyed
despite
its
unfamiliarity
we
dont
know
what
these
early
brews
tasted
like
but
a
lot
of
the
dogfish
head
attempts
sure
are
convincing
that
they
could
have
been
brewed
at
the
dawn
of
time
this
beer
has
a
good
amber
color
with
thin
lacing
the
smell
is
sour
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
sour
but
not
offputting
you
can
really
taste
the
cranberry
which
adds
a
nice
bitterness
and
the
sweetness
of
the
honey
paired
with
the
sour
goes
good
together
this
isnt
my
favorite
dogfish
head
but
its
a
good
one
if
you
see
it
try
it
o
better
than
some
of
their
other
ancient
ales
but
still
nothing
to
write
home
about
midas
touch
and
sahti
if
thats
technically
one
of
their
ancient
ales
are
still
far
and
away
the
best
theyve
made
in
this
category
m
medium
bodied
overall
a
rather
interesting
brew
with
a
rather
interesting
tart
fruit
and
winelike
taste
at
first
sip
i
didnt
think
i
liked
it
much
but
over
time
the
more
subtle
hard
to
explain
nuances
and
flavors
became
more
apparent
producing
a
rather
intriguing
and
enjoyable
sipper
of
a
beer
o
interesting
as
most
dfh
beers
are
but
there
is
just
too
much
going
on
for
me
i
think
it
might
be
tolerable
if
the
berries
werent
so
potent
i
will
give
it
credit
for
drinkability
especially
as
it
warms
up
for
a
10
beer
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
lots
of
sweetness
too
poured
from
a
750ml
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
rose
tinted
copper
coloring
slightly
hazed
and
bright
with
a
frothy
filmy
offwhite
head
aromas
of
cranberry
and
raspberry
but
concentrated
like
they
have
been
boiled
for
jam
with
toasted
grains
and
a
kick
of
booze
flavors
are
tart
forward
with
cranberry
in
the
forefront
a
subtle
rich
sweetness
of
honey
roast
characteristics
woody
notes
and
a
hint
of
booze
bold
robust
bodied
but
it
remains
thin
enough
to
be
drinkable
the
aftertaste
is
roasted
and
richly
tart
with
a
subtle
warmth
building
tangy
fruit
sweetness
lingers
into
a
thin
slick
finish
real
fun
and
neat
creation
quite
memorable
and
unique
nice
work
o
i
believe
this
is
my
least
favorite
dfh
brew
i
have
had
yet
its
really
watery
and
just
not
really
all
there
it
seems
its
not
terrible
but
its
not
really
good
either
o
i
find
the
ancient
ales
from
dfh
to
be
a
lot
of
fun
for
better
or
worse
never
knowing
what
to
expect
from
any
standpoint
is
my
main
attraction
to
these
beers
id
say
kvasir
is
a
hit
in
comparison
to
several
of
the
others
but
perhaps
not
one
of
the
top
tier
brews
from
the
series
i
really
think
any
of
these
beers
are
worth
a
try
and
kvasir
is
one
that
i
could
see
myself
buying
again
like
theobroma
sahtea
or
birra
etrusca
worth
a
go
for
sure
im
not
sure
if
this
was
meant
to
be
the
new
fort
or
just
another
crazy
idea
from
dfh
but
if
fort
was
what
you
were
expecting
from
this
its
not
close
by
a
longshot
o
a
nice
little
experiment
in
brewing
history
yet
again
from
dfh
extremely
drinkable
for
being
10
its
almost
like
straightup
alcoholic
herbal
cranberry
juice
with
a
few
more
nuances
obviously
interesting
and
worth
a
try
by
the
way
it
has
an
interesting
description
and
history
of
it
on
the
dfh
website
o
ok
but
different
like
all
of
their
ancient
ales
overall
more
kudos
to
sam
and
team
very
interesting
experiment
and
a
solid
beer
overall
a
bit
more
herbspice
forward
than
i
was
expecting
i
was
hoping
theyd
really
let
the
berries
shine
through
an
be
the
star
of
the
beer
but
that
didnt
end
up
being
the
case
nevertheless
this
is
still
a
decent
offering
thats
worth
picking
up
if
youre
a
dfh
fan
not
the
best
of
the
ancient
ales
series
but
certainly
not
the
worst
either
o
definitely
woodsy
with
a
mild
leafy
taste
very
smooth
and
quaffable
instead
of
hops
this
is
made
using
redwood
tips
like
a
gruit
its
a
ruddy
amber
in
color
with
great
foam
the
aroma
of
redwood
tips
is
there
present
and
upfront
with
that
i
find
notes
of
cherries
and
sweet
vermouth
like
a
wellmade
manhattan
its
lightly
carbonated
giving
it
a
fuller
rounder
body
its
not
hoppy
but
mellow
with
that
sweet
wine
finish
needless
to
say
i
loved
every
sip
o
it
tasted
almost
exactly
like
death
and
taxes
to
me
with
less
of
that
smoky
flavor
until
the
spice
hit
at
the
end
it
is
really
delicious
and
i
loved
the
subtleties
of
the
aftertaste
it
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
classic
beer
style
i
will
definitely
order
this
again
d
interesting
beer
id
probably
guess
hoppy
black
lager
or
porter
if
having
this
blind
which
is
indeed
what
happened
as
flavor
had
no
idea
what
the
beer
was
when
i
asked
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
and
had
no
problem
putting
down
the
entire
pint
o
i
tried
and
was
not
a
fan
legal
tender
which
was
also
a
gruit
i
almost
didnt
order
it
for
that
reason
but
i
am
really
happy
i
did
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
one
i
will
order
again
i
almost
didnt
order
this
becaus
id
had
it
before
im
glad
i
got
it
because
its
way
better
than
i
remember
it
being
great
roasty
tones
with
good
spicing
and
the
redwood
adds
a
nice
flavor
wonderful
this
beer
wasnt
really
what
i
expected
at
all
but
i
liked
it
fairly
understated
in
flavor
i
found
that
i
downed
this
beer
very
quickly
moonlight
brewing
works
hard
for
their
money
and
im
glad
the
beer
reviewing
world
treats
them
right
although
this
offering
with
less
than
20
reviews
under
its
belt
is
still
in
its
infancy
it
already
rates
a
b
and
ive
no
doubt
itll
soon
have
an
a
next
to
it
and
its
a
pretty
clean
and
crisp
beer
on
the
whole
for
a
nonhoppedgruit
style
beer
creamy
head
with
some
nice
lacing
smells
grainy
with
some
spicy
notes
and
a
light
banana
and
cherry
sweetness
the
taste
also
has
a
grainy
anf
fruity
sweetness
with
the
spicyearthy
notes
of
the
redwood
tips
creeping
up
the
backend
there
is
also
some
more
sweet
banana
and
cherry
as
well
as
some
citrus
and
bitter
flavors
that
i
would
swear
were
from
hops
ends
with
some
smooth
what
youd
expect
from
an
english
brown
ale
mild
carbonation
and
delicious
taste
make
this
one
very
drinkable
brew
im
impressed
by
the
fact
that
the
redwood
isnt
really
the
focal
point
of
this
brew
its
evidently
simply
used
in
the
same
capacacity
that
hops
would
have
been
used
rzzzzzmay
11
as
mentioned
by
others
the
appearance
is
quite
nice
things
go
south
pretty
quickly
from
there
the
smell
is
not
completely
terrible
some
nice
nuttyearthy
notes
however
once
it
enters
your
mouth
those
same
notes
are
intensified
to
levels
that
just
arent
very
palatable
d
i
normally
like
moonlights
beers
and
im
one
to
try
just
about
anything
i
couldnt
take
more
than
a
couple
ounces
of
this
and
have
no
desire
to
try
this
again
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
for
purposes
other
than
biological
warfare
its
amber
in
color
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
or
retention
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
smell
it
did
the
beer
is
brewed
with
two
oddball
spcies
but
thyme
and
sage
are
what
they
smell
like
yes
i
know
those
arent
the
exact
spcies
but
thats
what
it
smells
like
to
me
it
smells
like
good
spicy
pizza
sauce
that
my
local
pizzaria
makes
a
hopless
beer
i
dont
taste
much
malt
as
the
spice
is
well
presented
in
this
beer
an
interesting
taste
just
like
the
aroma
it
justs
smells
better
than
it
tastes
one
serving
was
fine
for
me
could
be
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
food
d
this
is
another
crazy
interesting
beverage
from
moonlight
i
really
liked
it
this
is
probably
the
most
unique
review
i
have
done
i
have
tried
a
few
of
brians
nonhopped
beers
before
and
found
this
to
be
my
least
favorite
i
really
see
this
used
better
as
a
cooking
ingredient
than
a
beverage
i
gave
it
3
5
for
smell
and
taste
because
i
found
them
both
to
be
very
interesting
the
taste
is
similar
but
much
lighter
the
herbalwoody
character
is
clearly
present
but
much
more
muted
and
blending
with
the
rest
to
add
some
complexity
and
an
intriguing
character
without
actually
tasting
so
obviously
herbal
as
it
smells
it
has
a
nice
faintly
fruitytoasty
maltiness
along
with
it
light
sweetness
very
light
bitterness
and
good
balance
overall
it
has
a
good
solid
yet
lively
feel
and
character
and
is
easy
to
drink
depsite
the
strong
uniqueness
one
of
the
more
successful
experimental
beers
from
moonlight
in
my
book
this
gets
big
points
for
being
both
very
unusual
and
characterful
yet
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
bottle
poured
an
amber
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
rosemary
and
thyme
is
overpowering
and
almost
too
much
to
handle
taste
is
also
totally
dominated
by
rosemary
and
thyme
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
interesting
but
too
much
herbs
makes
this
one
unbearable
after
a
while
tastes
like
a
mix
of
hefeweizen
and
artemis
to
me
i
get
some
banana
moderately
spiced
with
thyme
and
basil
its
very
different
and
not
was
i
was
expecting
but
overall
it
is
workable
and
easier
to
approach
than
its
love
or
hate
stablemate
that
doesnt
mean
its
a
beer
youd
want
more
than
a
pint
of
though
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
creamy
a
great
combination
here
can
get
a
little
too
fizzy
for
me
at
times
but
overall
it
remains
solid
in
this
category
drinkability
is
very
good
considering
the
heavy
oregano
the
checks
of
citrus
and
grain
do
very
well
cant
say
ive
had
many
beers
in
this
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
with
all
of
moonlights
beers
i
have
had
they
are
crisp
and
delightful
the
flavors
bounce
on
the
palate
wonderfully
and
the
carbonation
plays
perfectly
with
the
beer
another
winner
that
threw
my
palate
for
a
loop
this
is
definitely
something
to
try
it
is
really
well
crafted
the
balance
is
excellent
but
you
have
to
love
rosemary
or
it
may
not
hold
your
interest
past
a
few
interesting
sips
very
special
d
my
palate
was
a
little
unused
to
the
herbed
flavor
of
the
beer
i
am
conditioned
to
expect
hops
as
the
bittering
agent
after
about
4oz
i
was
done
with
my
share
but
i
didnt
regret
trying
the
beer
its
just
that
the
oregano
flavor
becomes
quite
strong
after
a
while
o
plaid
to
the
bone
is
a
pleasant
ale
that
is
a
refreshing
change
from
the
heavily
hopped
brews
i
usually
consume
its
got
loads
of
pleasant
sweetness
without
the
hopbomb
to
go
with
it
although
i
cant
say
this
will
be
a
regular
for
me
it
is
a
good
brew
and
i
could
certainly
see
this
as
a
summer
refresher
aromas
of
butter
and
toffee
dominate
the
aroma
and
flavor
light
burnt
caramel
flavor
little
to
no
spice
theres
supposed
to
be
heather
in
here
but
honestly
there
is
so
much
diacetyl
in
my
glass
i
cant
find
much
else
not
for
me
plaid
to
the
bone
is
pretty
much
just
all
skin
and
bone
it
has
a
pale
frail
and
plain
profile
that
does
no
justice
to
its
special
ingredient
nor
the
fantastic
brewery
that
made
it
hopefully
picaroons
comes
up
with
a
different
recipe
for
2014
because
they
are
capable
of
much
better
than
this
this
may
be
the
first
and
only
picaroons
beer
i
didnt
truly
enjoy
500ml
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
very
clear
and
pale
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
nice
aromatic
bouquet
on
the
nose
with
a
lot
of
herbs
coming
trough
really
pleasant
flavor
well
balanced
and
different
because
of
the
lack
of
hops
really
nice
summer
beer
