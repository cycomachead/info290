detectable

and
to

rather
disappointing
a
p
s
just
for
horst
my
sharing
partner
says
it
was
very
well
made
bone
dry
and
he
really
has
nothing
to
compare
it
to
but
went
into
this
thinking
he
would
not
like
it
but
did
the
beer
pours
a
reding
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
a
thing
of
beauty
the
aroma
is
exceptional
there
are
all
the
elements
of
a
dunkel
weizen
here
but
with
the
addition
of
rye
that
adds
a
unique
aroma
as
well
as
taste
the
taste
is
good
again
the
caramel
wheat
flavor
overcomes
you
but
the
addition
of
rye
adds
an
extra
element
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
has
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
a
great
drinking
beer
a
style
that
i
have
never
tried
before
thanks
chris
the
weekend
warrior
for
bringing
this
one
from
overseas
hmm
well
its
a
very
nice
brew
very
dunkelish
pours
a
red
toned
caramelish
brew
small
head
all
the
aromas
are
very
much
weizen
as
is
most
of
the
flavour
this
beer
is
very
similar
to
the
common
paulaner
naturtrub
but
has
a
slightly
stronger
taste
and
mouthfeel
which
makes
it
only
slightly
different
and
maybe
better
for
some
dunklewiezenish
in
that
it
has
some
very
bananaish
flavours
with
slight
hints
of
craamel
and
toffee
dry
finish
lightly
tart
and
pretty
tasty
all
round
relatively
soft
with
some
earthy
notes
breadydoughy
at
times
with
some
stickyness
dryish
finish
pretty
tasty
flavours
are
a
little
shortlived
but
include
banana
and
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
a
toasty
note
tho
the
rye
isnt
extremely
obvious
the
result
is
a
very
tasty
dunkelweizen
really
good
overall
i
was
very
excited
about
this
one
but
felt
a
bit
let
down
which
probably
led
to
the
relatively
low
grade
was
hoping
for
a
finnish
rye
bread
and
wheat
sweetness
but
ended
up
with
a
rather
strange
flowery
and
perfumeish
beer
its
drinkable
though
rye
and
wheat
in
the
same
beer
i
dont
know
about
this
one
i
like
the
idea
and
its
pretty
well
put
together
but
it
does
feel
like
a
bit
of
a
blindmansbluff
experiment
and
they
could
have
leaned
a
bit
heavier
on
some
elements
to
make
it
pop
out
not
overly
complex
but
a
decent
balance
of
bananayeastwheatness
with
caramel
maltyness
malt
flavor
is
more
honey
caramel
as
opposed
to
much
darkerroasted
flavors
some
spicyness
in
there
not
nearly
as
much
as
american
rye
beers
though
different
i
guess
its
not
a
typical
roggenbier
in
that
its
wheat
based
this
brewery
is
for
sure
hit
or
miss
this
one
seems
ot
be
more
of
a
miss
however
when
i
was
state
side
i
managed
to
have
a
fresh
glass
of
the
bruerys
rugbrod
on
tap
at
the
ginger
man
in
nyc
and
i
remember
a
slightly
more
spiced
character
but
this
is
every
bit
as
good
and
unlike
rugbrod
not
so
strong
so
a
glass
doesnt
overwhelm
you
tastes
i
would
award
5
on
smell
and
taste
but
i
havent
tried
all
rye
beers
in
the
world
to
try
so
maybe
a
edit
in
the
future
but
for
now
a
strong
contender
for
the
best
cheers
heres
to
a
good
discovery
d
if
all
roggens
are
like
this
this
was
a
great
beer
in
my
mouth
at
least
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
creamy
and
i
could
drink
this
again
o
decent
beer
different
and
interesting
though
i
wouldnt
jump
at
it
like
this
beer
suprised
the
abv
was
just
5
5
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
overall
some
interesting
flavors
but
it
didnt
seem
to
blend
very
well
each
was
a
distinct
piece
rather
than
melding
together
into
a
whole
overall
i
like
this
it
has
more
to
offer
spice
wise
than
the
hazelnut
brown
but
is
different
in
its
own
right
i
think
the
use
of
quality
ingredients
is
what
sets
this
apart
i
would
go
again
on
this
one
o
this
is
my
first
roggenbier
so
i
didnt
know
what
exactly
to
expect
it
actually
drinks
like
a
hoppy
peppery
brown
ale
overall
its
not
very
complex
but
quite
drinkable
3
5
final
thoughts
although
this
may
be
my
first
roggenbier
and
not
even
a
germanmade
one
at
that
it
was
highly
enjoyable
and
brought
together
the
flavors
of
a
few
different
styles
my
one
caveat
would
be
that
the
rye
while
in
the
name
of
the
beer
was
not
entirely
present
in
the
flavor
however
it
did
not
stop
me
from
fully
enjoying
the
experience
nicely
done
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
4

very
sophisticated
drop
smoky
curious
but
ultimately
finely
balanced
and
nuanced
this
is
a
wellbalanced
brew
despite
my
misapprehensions
about
rogues
smoked
malts
and
perhaps
a
good
an
introduction
to
this
style
which
i
had
not
tried
before
pours
a
cloudy
hazy
medium
brown
color
with
offwhite
colored
head
thin
layer
of
head
hangs
on
until
the
bottom
of
the
glass
some
lacing
aroma
is
earthy
herbal
but
subtle
taste
is
well
balanced
starts
a
bit
sweet
finishes
drier
long
finish
rye
is
definitely
highlighted
medium
body
and
carbonation
o
this
is
very
good
and
smooth
but
i
wish
there
were
a
little
more
flavor
its
a
bit
too
heavily
carbonated
in
a
medium
body
it
gets
crisp
but
cant
fully
achieve
a
firm
bite
before
the
carbonation
gives
way
to
a
smoother
undertone
it
thins
out
some
in
the
end
after
it
gets
a
little
tinny
o
i
dont
know
much
about
this
style
but
this
version
doesnt
impress
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
rye
that
is
a
little
more
on
the
mild
hop
side
quite
enjoyable
in
the
old
days
we
could
rate
a
beer
for
drinkability
this
would
be
one
of
my
top
5
beers
from
2013
in
drinkability
if
i
could
get
this
in
6packs
it
would
be
in
my
regular
rotation
put
this
up
against
your
favorite
weizenbock
and
i
dont
think
youll
be
disappointed
i
think
this
is
my
first
roggenbier
and
i
rather
liked
it
just
sahti
and
happoshu
to
go
and
ive
tried
every
style
listed
on
ba
overall
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
it
had
a
lot
going
for
it
and
managed
to
package
it
into
a
very
neat
and
coherent
brew

pours
a
dark
brown
hazy
root
beer
hue
with
about
four
fingers
of
tan
head
aroma
does
evoke
weizen
yeast
spice
and
dark
sweet
malts
with
a
whiff
of
smoke
and
fruit
the
beer
starts
with
some
caramel
and
biscuit
malts
and
a
vanilla
bourbonlike
rounded
sweetness
that
is
really
quite
nice
the
smoke
is
subdued
in
my
view
do
not
be
deterred
by
this
the
weizen
yeast
flavors
are
also
subtle
at
least
to
my
palate
i
dont
get
much
banana
but
there
is
some
plum
on
the
finish
peppery
spice
makes
an
appearance
but
once
more
is
mellow
the
malts
add
coffee
flavors
and
the
rye
adds
a
grainy
spicy
bite
but
overall
the
beer
is
smooth
and
balanced
think
brown

weizen
yeast

than
a

offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
caramel
malt
with
slightly
sour
spicy
rye
and
light
grassy
hops
flavor
is
a
very
well
melded
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
rye
and
slight
nuttiness
that
is
somewhat
subdued
but
so
nicely
integrated
that
it
is
quite
satisfying
an
unexpectedly
nice
medium
creamy
body
with
excellent
mouth
feel
a
nice
understated
roggenbier
that
seems
a
bit
bland
at
first
but
won
me
over
with
a
very
satisfying
balance
and
flavor
a
nice
roggenbier
that
i
will
buy
again
medium
bodied
with
a
little
bit
of
an
acidic
mouthfeel
medium
length
overall
this
is
the
first
rogenbier
i
have
had
before
so
it
makes
things
tough
to
compare
with
others
still
an
enjoyable
beer
alright
for
the
style
wouldnt
buy
it
again
most
of
the
special
releases
from
rogue
are
underwhelming
me
drinks
easy
but
doesnt
really
entice
you
to
want
more
o
my
first
of
the
style
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
i
really
like
how
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
the
smoke
and
weizen
yeast
all
work
together
to
provide
a
nicely
complex
and
enjoyable
beer
comparable
to
schlenkerla
weizen
with
a
heavy
rye
presence
i
can
see
how
the
smokiness
might
be
a
bit
polarizing
if
smoked
beers
arent
your
thing
if
youre
a
fan
of
smoked
beers
then
id
recommend
this
the
spice
and
pepper
are
muted
but
present
in
the
smell
hopes
make
a
secondary
appearance
malt
is
a
much
larger
part
of
the
taste
and
it
balances
quite
nicely
mouthfeel
is
decent
perhaps
a
touch
too
much
pepper
for
malt
and
hops
to
stand
up
against
overall
this
is
the
sort
of
flavor
i
look
for
in
a
rye
beer
an
enjoyable
drink
pretty
boring
o
i
expected
a
ton
of
rye
flavor
i
thought
is
was
sort
of
bland
its
cheap
enough
but
i
do
not
foresee
purchasing
any
more
of
it
o
definitely
a
tasty
brew
and
a
style
which
i
dont
recall
having
tried
although
i
was
surprised
on
the
amount
of
yeasty
esters
it
did
seem
to
work
well
to
compliment
the
spicy
grain
not
a
mind
blower
but
another
solid
offering
from
rogue
o
probably
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
in
the
style
not
that
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
have
many
of
these
i
think
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
one
i
could
enjoy
several
of
during
a
session
definitely
worth
grabbing
and
i
am
not
always
the
biggest
fan
of
rogues
offerings
o
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
really
drinkable
compared
to
the
other
beers
ive
had
in
this
style
overall
i
am
not
sure
if
other
roggenbiers
are
like
this
but
i
like
the
diversity
and
balance
in
this
beer
regardless
and
the
smokey
touch
is
a
real
treat
to
me
also
i
could
have
this
again
note
there
is
a
duplicate
of
this
one
called
roguenbier
rye
and
categorized
simply
as
a
rye
ale
these
should
be
combined
they
have
stopped
calling
this
one
rogue
farms
now
they
use
the
title
rogue
chatoe
for
the
series
o
roggenbier
is
a
super
rare
style
so
i
had
to
pick
a
bomber
of
this
up
finishes
a
lot
better
than
it
starts
go
for
it
for
a
unique
experience
though
it
still
has
that
rogue

never
had
this

before
but
this
was
very
enjoyable
overall
appallingly
bad
overall
its
a
fantastic
rye
beer
and
one
that
isnt
overly
hoppy
or
noticeably
rye
on
the
palatte
the
subtle
flavors
come
through
but
arent
in
your
face
you
might
even
have
to
think
about
whats
being
presented
to
you
its
definitely
one
to
try
on
its
own
or
with
food
if
paired
i
might
say
some
pizza
chicken
or
even
some
non
spicy
chinese
food
prost
lampertland
overall
i
am
perplexed
this
just
feels
like
a
complete
miss
to
me
thanks
to
buschbeer
for
the
try
poured
from
a
650ml
bottle
pours
a
brown
slightly
cloudy
colour
the
nose
is
amazingly
complex
with
aromas
of
cloves
spice
grapefruit
ginger
peppered
beef
jerky
smoked
meat
the
taste
is
similarly
intense
dry
and
smoky
there
are
notes
of
grapefruit
and
peppery
spice
the
creamy
mouthful
makes
it
remarkably
easy
drinking
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
the
beer
pours
clear
dark
toffee
brown
from
the
bottle
but
collects
into
a
near
opaque
brown
in
the
glass
theres
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
slowly
there
are
aromas
of
rye
malt
brown
bread
smoked
malt
and
earthy
hops
the
dominant
flavor
is
an
interesting
mix
of
the
spicy
rye
character
and
smokiness
theres
some
brown
bread
and
earthiness
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
theres
a
lingering
earthy
and
smoky
aftertaste
the
beer
does
go
down
smoothly
and
pleasantly
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
its
hard
for
me
to
gauge
how
true
to
the
style
this
beer
is
because
its
the
first
and
only
roggenbier
ive
ever
seen
available
based
on
what
ive
read
though
it
does
sound
like
it
stays
true
to
the
style
that
said
i
doubt
id
buy
this
beer
again
its
fair
but
this
isnt
a
style
i
can
see
myself
getting
into
and
based
on
the
lack
breweries
producing
it
i
think
a
lot
of
people
feel
the
same
way
well
thats
one
way
to
get
pronunciation
right
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sunset
topaz
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
rye
bread
light
black
pepper
and
a
vague
sense
of
some
sort
of
orange
character
the
taste
keeps
some
of
the
spiciness
and
breadiness
and
adds
a
decent
helping
of
soap
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
chewyish
feel
overall
this
beer
just
didnt
sit
right
with
me
theres
no
real
sense
of
weizenyeast
character
the
rye
doesnt
meld
well
with
anything
else
and
the
flavors
just
fall
flat
an
okish
rye
beer
how
this
is
a
german
rogenbier
vs
an
american
rye
ale
i
dont
know
more
rye
than
most
beers
and
whiskies
alike
so
points
abounding
there
i
suppose
but
theres
not
much
more
worthy
here
beyond
that
pithy
foreign
reference
o
my
first
roggenbier
well
balanced
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
just
wish
the
nose
wasnt
so
unpleasant
o
definitely
worth
a
try
as
its
so
unique
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
again
in
the
near
future
but
still
very
good
the
first
taste
of
the
roggenbier
style
but
it
seemed
to
fit
the
descriptions
of
the
style
fairly
well
and
was
enjoyable
to
drink
it
really
makes
me
wish
there
was
a
more
readily
available
example
of
the
style
cheers
this
beer
really
showcases
the
ryes
grain
profile
by
itself
that
quality
will
probably
make
this
beer
a
cult
favorite
and
despised
by
others
but
this
beer
is
also
the
cda
of
rye
beers
judging
from
color
and
aromatic
profile
and
a
good
cda
at
that
tldr
a
heavily
smoked
belgian
ipa
with
a
tart
redapple
bitterness
that
you
will
taste
the
next
morning
3
5s
across
the
board
i
wish
i
could
have
given
higher
numbers
but
personal
preference
definitely
came
into
play
with
this
bottle
NA
from
notes
at
the
brewery
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
orange
with
a
spottylacing
offwhite
head
aroma
of
lightly
sweet
caramel
malt
and
bavarian
yeast
with
a
touch
of
lemon
and
banana
esters
starts
with
average
fullness
and
mild
toasty
malt
and
rye
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
clove
toward
a
dry
crisp
finish
a
pretty
unique
and
drinkable
brew
with
good
authenticity
enjoyed
the
cheeseburgers
here
beer
is
medium
body
a
little
heavier
than
expected
nice
wheat
like
character
or
is
that
the
rye
i
was
expecting
some
more
rye
spice
to
this
beer
but
i
didnt
get
it
there
is
some
banana
ester
flavors
in
the
back
mouth
aftertaste
not
unpleasant
good
drinkability
good
mouthfeel
overall
a
good
beer
d
only
available
at
sweetwater
tavern
so
yeah
definitely
an
easy
beer
to
drink
this
is
the
first
beer
that
i
have
had
from
sweetwater
ill
definitely
have
to
try
some
more
down
the
road
overall
i
liked
this
this
would
go
great
with
a
burger
or
steak
the
rye
is
very
apparent
and
has
a
great
taste
not
overpowering
at
all
NA
o
fantastic
from
the
first
whiff
to
the
last
drop
vintages
tippy
toboggan
blends
the
summery
aromatics
and
flavors
of
a
classic
hefeweizen
with
raw
earthiness
from
rye
for
a
unique
and
spicy
germanstyle
beer
thats
straightup
classic
o
this
style
would
be
something
i
could
really
get
into
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
from
the
tap
this
rogeenbier
comes
amber
colored
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
rather
malty
spicy
and
sweet
with
that
unmistakable
hefeweizen
yeast
characterspicy
cloves
and
banana
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
hefeweizen
sweet
and
malty
with
spicy
slightly
dry
character
from
the
rye
the
beer
finishes
just
slightly
dry
and
makes
you
want
more
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
body
medium
maybe
mediumthin
in
fact
that
might
be
the
one
thing
that
could
use
some
improvement
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
would
like
to
enjoy
again
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
NA
im
unfamiliar
with
the
style
but
this
one
seemed
enjoyable
enough
overall
this
beer
has
a
je
ne
sais
quoi
that
appeals
to
me
although
it
also
seems
like
it
could
be
cleaned
up
a
little
im
not
a
pro
on
roggenbiers
but
this
one
seems
decent
to
me
overall
all
over
the
place
individual
flavors
are
interesting
but
doesnt
work
at
all
together

for

very
interesting
and
quite
tasty
actually
i
would
think
this
would
be
extremely
drinkable
to
most
people
particularly
those
who
like
a
nice
dunkelweisselike
flavor
had
wanted
to
try
this
style
after
reading
about
it
a
few
months
ago
thanx
to
lets
pour
for
the
chance
a
very
interesting
style
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
others
and
see
how
they
stack
up
to
this
one
which
was
very
good
o
rye
and

a
nice

poured

a

and

around
the
glass
aroma
of
wheat
banana

with

mild

sourness
with

with

than
the

indicated
this
is
exactly
the
way
i
would
have
expected
a
rye
hefeweizen
taste
i
have
never
had
a
roggenbier
from
its
native
home
but
this
is
what
i
would
expect
a
nice
refreshing
change
of
pace
light
ale
one
of
three
rye
beers
from
this
brewery
that
were
just
released
and
ill
be
trying
over
the
next
week
glad
to
see
more
rye
styles
available
overall

great

i
love
german
beers
and
i
reserve
a
fair
amount
of
judgment
for
each
contribution
to
the
category
in
conclusion
i
would
humbly
state
that
if
you
have
the
chance
to
drink
this
beer
do
o
not
bad
at
all
but
a
bit
hard
to
place
with
a
soft
mouthfeel
different
it
tastes
like
a
great
alternative
for
the
nonhop
crowd
and
hefeweizen
fans
and
you
for
sure
get
some
smokeytoasty
flavors
in
a
very
easydrinking
vessel
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
seems
i
may
have
gotten
an
infected
batch
as
my
experience
with
the
flavor
and
aroma
was
quite
different
than
all
the
other
reviews
i
see
and
it
has
a
significant
tart
character
however
i
enjoyed
that
aspect
of
it
id
like
to
try
this
again
sometime
to
see
if
it
taste
at
all
the
same
as
this
one
medium
mouthfeel
and
high
carbonation
the
aroma
was
rich
lots
of
caramel
mixed
in
as
well
providing
a
slightly
sweet
balance
to
it
the
only
downside
would
have
to
be
the
lightness
of
the
aroma
needed
a
little
more
kick
the
flavor
was
very
well
rounded
started
with
a
nice
punch
of
caramel
with
a
decent
roasted
malt
and
smoked
quality
coming
through
in
the
middle
light
grain
and
bready
nature
with
a
decidedly
sweet
finish
to
it
that
rolled
off
the
tongue
with
a
subtle
tone
there
was
a
very
nice
feel
on
this
one
coating
would
be
a
good
word
as
it
rolled
through
the
mouth
and
stuck
to
every
surface
available
on
draught
poured
with
absolutely
no
headfoam
very
very
thin
layer
like
a
lace
of
lacing
a
cloudy
light
molasses
color
like
amber
honey
unfiltered
not
picking
up
a
whole
lot
on
the
nose
but
the
taste
wow
the
rye
bursts
through
such
a
great
taste
such
a
great
rye
profile
theres
a
smoothness
to
this
beer
that
is
met
with
the
rye
spiciness
and
a
clean
finish
it
could
go
wrong
in
so
many
ways
but
doesnt
if
it
was
chewy
i
dont
think
id
enjoy
it
as
much
and
its
not
overly
sweet
either
great
mouthfeel
the
rye
dominates
it
shines
another
beer
i
wish
was
bottled
or
made
its
way
to
san
anto
ive
never
tasted
such
a
rye
forward
beer
before
usually
they
seem
to
be
blends
like
a
ryepa
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
it
just
didnt
have
as
much
aroma
or
flavor
as
id
expected
refreshing
but
cant
say
id
be
searching
it
out
would
like
to
try
again
just
to
make
sure
i
got
a
good
sample
of
it
resample
very
mild
hop
profile
really
showcases
the
rye
highly
drinkable
and
delicious
i
guess
you
need
a
real
live
german
to
brew
a
good
roggenbier
it
takes
a
guy
who
loves
pumpernickel
heh
o
full
disclosure
im
something
of
a
novice
with
this
style
so
i
can
only
go
by
what
my
taste
buds
are
telling
me
and
what
ive
read
about
it
the
message
im
getting
is
that
id
like
some
more
of
it
and
at
4
8
i
may
well
sit
on
this
one
all
evening
its
a
good
accompaniment
to
the
hot
weather
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
copper
hue
medium
offwhite
head
with
a
bit
of
retention
and
some
spotty
lacing
the
nose
carries
quite
a
bit
of
rye
and
not
nearly
as
much
yeast
character
as
i
would
prefer
malt
and
yeast
heavy
the
flavor
falls
along
the
same
lines
a
bit
of
german
yeast
but
other
than
that
lots
of
rye
and
accompanying
light
spice
bready
malt
in
the
background
light
to
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
though
not
quite
as
good
as
the
other
live
oak
beers
that
ive
had
the
flavor
of
live
oaks
roggenbier
is
quite
lively
with
that
signature
rye
spice
coating
the
entire
palate
from
start
to
finish
slightly
fruity
and
floral
with
enough
bitterness
from
the
hops
to
balance
the
rye
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
creamy
but
strangely
thin
enough
in
body
to
make
for
an
easy
sipper
the
5
abv
doesnt
hurt
either
overall
a
tasty
take
on
a
style
that
american
brewers
are
just
starting
to
catch
on
to
live
oak
rarely
disappoints
with
their
german
interpretations
and
the
roggenbier
is
no
exception
overall
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
light
enough
to
drink
a
few
but
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
quaffable
its
easy
to
see
why
lobc
chose
this
for
their
summer
seasonal
and
i
definitely
hope
to
have
it
again
next
summer
this
is
also
my
2000th
review
cracked
this
bad
boy
during
taiyeds
graduation
party
congrats
on
the
masters
alex
it
pours
a
cloudy
amberauburn
tawn
topped
by
a
couple
fingers
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
lemon
zest
lemon
peel
black
pepper
and
orange
peel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
wheat
grass
light
clove
very
light
black
pepper
flowers
dark
greens
and
more
wheat
i
dont
get
all
that
much
rye
character
here
oddly
enough
the
body
straddles
the
line
between
hefty
light
and
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
decent
roggen
but
lacking
in
much
rye
character
and
nearly
boring
beyond
that
very
easy
to
drink
though
and
in
no
way
objectionable
i
love
this
there
is
an
excellent
bready
rye
character
that
is
pretty
much
perfect
for
the
style
i
had
several
pints
of
this
and
could
have
easily
had
more
awesome
and
highly
recommended
overall
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
i
hope
live
oak
turns
this
into
a
regular
summer
seasonal
because
i
will
look
forward
to
it
edit
as
i
keep
drinking
i
start
to
get
a
slightly
dirty
buildup
on
my
tongue
docks
a
bit
from
the
taste
still
very
enjoyable
hazy
amber
in
color
the
aroma
has
some
wheat
and
rye
notes
but
what
really
comes
through
is
the
clove
character
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
some
rye
and
clove
notes
as
well
as
the
addition
of
some
banana
the
yeast
really
adds
some
nice
flavors
to
this
beer
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
likely
the
best
abita
beer
i
have
tried
o
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
appreciate
the
extra
1
5
points
in
alcohol
content
above
the
average
for
the
style
provides
some
additional
character
another
my
place
newtown
ct
find
this
one
is
a
very
cloudy
murky
tan
color
with
a
decent
white
head
and
a
goodly
wall
of
lace
the
aroma
is
interesting
with
significant
clove
and
bacon
and
mild
citrusmalt
highlights
the
flavor
brings
on
an
intense
sweet
grass
malt
and
clove
combo
with
the
hint
of
banana
very
nice
and
a
pleasant
surprise
for
sure
clove
and
bright
citrus
bite
dominates
with
a
mellow
wheat
malt
background
and
just
the
suggestion
of
some
booze
the
body
of
this
brew
is
medium
with
a
light
crisp
feel
from
tiny
bubbles
drinks
nicely
though
probably
not
an
ideal
session
beer
restores
my
faith
in
abita
overall
a
great
beer
would
like
to
see
abita
bottle
this
pours
a
great
golden
hazey
color

my
pint
at
bulldog
midcity

taste
is
very
very
amazing
surprisingly
amazing
and
full
of
perfect

flavors
and
aromas
really
surprised
by
this
brew
its
truly
an
amazing
hefe
and
full
of
perfect
banana
and
clove
flavor
perfect
balance
great
feel
some
rye
bitters
if
you
see
this
brew
get
it
although
i
am
failing
to
find
a
real
difference
with
a
roggenbier
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
purchased
in
a
sampler
pack
the
rye
is
not
overpowering
like
it
is
in
some
rye
beers
i
dont
have
a
whole
whack
of
examples
of
this
style
upon
which
to
draw
so
i
cant
say
how
well
this
one
falls
into
the
canon
as
such
but
this
is
certainly
sweeter
than
my
average
roggenbier
worthy
of
giving
a
go
nonetheless
even
if
any
brew
from
this
outfit
reminds
me
of
kicking
it
in
the
bar
of
my
fancy
victoria
st
hotel
with
my
future
wife
a
number
of
years
ago
final

a
b
resurrection
roggenbier
is
the
third
ryefocused
brew
ive
tried
from
camerons
and
as
far
as
im
concerned
its
yet
another
winner
this
beer
has
a
decidedly
hefeweizenesque
vibe
to
it
and
for
that
reason
i
must
strongly
recommend
it
to
fans
of
that
style
as
they
are
sure
to
appreciate
the
spicy
finish
and
banana
esters
that
characterize
this
solid
sessionable
rye
beer
i
cant
say
how
this
compares
to
other
examples
of
the
style
but
i
knows
what
i
likes
and
i
doubt
that
this
is
the
last
my
glass
will
see
of
this
beer
before
the
end
of
the
year
o
never
had
this
style
before
but
it
is
certainly
unique
i
love
the
idea
of
rye
beers
but
i
dont
have
anything
really
to
compare
this
with
as
its
my
first
roggienbier
dry
and
unique
but
nothing
really
standing
out
to
make
it
interesting
it
wants
food
and
by
that
i
mean
i
see
myself
not
drinking
this
for
the
outstanding
flavor
but
more
for
its
unique
even
keeled
character
or
perhaps
as
refreshment
on
a
hot
day
cool
label
camerons
resurrection
is
a
considerably
unique
offering
you
dont
find
many
roggenbiers
indeed
there
is
far
too
much
clove
and
peppery
yeastiness
to
appreciate
any
of
the
conventional
pumpernickel
or
sweet
toasty
graininess
that
many
myself
included
have
become
accustomed
to
tasting
in
rye
beers
ja
gute
arbeit
sicher
a
decent
rye
heavy
beer
with
lots
of
spice
and
herbal
notes
its
a
fairly
good
all
round
beer
rye
is
very
evident
but
there
isnt
a
ton
else
going
on
balance
is
good
and
its
got
a
herbedtonic
character
that
is
cool
but
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
worth
a
try
but
short
if
outstanding
bottle
poured
a
light
brown
color
ale
with
a
generous
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
rye
malt
with
light
spicy
notes
taste
is
quite
smooth
with
some
spicy
notes
and
a
smooth
finish
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
maybe
a
tad
too
dry
for
its
own
good
and
a
bit
too
much
notes
of
unrefined
grain
to
be
highly
drinkable
spicy
nose
like
a
weakkneed
weizen
comes
across
the
same
way
tastewise
spicy
bananafruity
but
a
touch
metallic
with
a
thin
brittle
mouthfeel
slightly
sour
finish
i
just
found
it
too
understated
to
be
interesting
or
satisfying
nothing
in
it
that
pops
overall
a
decent
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
beer
but
nothing
that
is
all
that

workable
closes
out
with
a
semidry

o
quite

goes
down

a

a

lingering

in

feel
is
light
and
easy
drinking
though
it
does
show
its
age
a
little
something
to
try
if
you
havent
had
the
style
but
its
not
representative
of
the
extremes
a
roggenbier
can
be
based
on
my
limited
experience
detailed
above
o
this
is
my
first
roggenbier
and
im
not
sure
what
to
think
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
grain
and
spice
and
a
little
less
sweetness
in
any
event
bioroggen
is
a
decent
beer
but
is
one
i
likely
will
not
revisit
anytime
soon
on
the
whole
a
fairly
average
beer
interesting
but
not
that
memorable
drinking
this
im
thinking
a
nicely
made
helles
lager
with
rye
malt
and
german
influence
kind
of
a
mix
of
the
two
countries
germany
and
austria
its
easy
enough
to
go
down
and
good
for
another
refreshing
o
this
beer
is
thin
and
crisp
with
a
very
soft
flavor
but
some
nice
lagered
qualities
in
the
finish
maybe
the
spiciness
from
the
rye
can
be
contributing
to
that
as
well
because
i
get
a
decent
amount
of
cinnamon
bark
and
other
spices
in
the
taste
as
well
there
is
a
nice
balanced
floral
hoping
to
this
one
with
only
a
modest
amount
of
biterness
the
body
is
mildmedium
slightly
syrupy
and
medium
sweetness
clean
taste
and
very
approachable
this
is
a
year
round
session
beer
which
i
believe
has
flavars
that
can
be
enjoyed
anytime
or
season
this
is
is
a
tad
too
sweet
for
the
style
some
nice
peepry
notes
perhaps
too
old
dont
know
what
the
date
code
41901120
means
picked
up
a
bottle
for
3
50
labeled
roggen
gold
though
im
confident
this
is
the
same
beer
its
simple
but
drinkable
with
plain
bready
euro
lager
malts
to
open
and
then
a
spicy
rye
and
peppery
noble
hops
finish
really
this
beer
could
use
more
character
its
not
offensive
but
its
quite
simple
and
unsurprising
d
not
a
terrible
beer
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
either
it
was
nice
to
try
a
nonus
version
of
a
roggenbier
but
thats
about
it
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
with
a
moderate
head
that
leaves
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
aroma
features
a
much
more
subdued
grain
presence
than
expected
taste
is
oddly
dominated
by
a
heavy
vanilla
presence
would
have
expected
a
much
more
assertive
ryegrainy
presence
than
this
mouthfeel
is
nicely
rounded
with
a
very
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
a
drinkable
brew
but
with
a
disappointing
level
of
graininess
for
my
tastes
i
never
thought
id
have
another
roggenbier
but
i
always
hoped
i
would
this
one
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
about
two
fingers
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
corn
black
pepper
and
rye
bread
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
more
pepper
and
the
addition
of
some
delightful
rye
spice
the
body
is
a
heavy
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
grainy
feel
overall
a
nice
roggen
something
that
can
easily
be
americanly
sessioned
any
day
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
with
thick
foam
head
and
really
nice
lacing
but
it
looks
rather
pale
and
clear
which
i
didnt
assume
typical
the
smell
is
rather
corn
syrupy
and
a
bit
sour
i
assume
from
the
rye
but
what
saves
it
is
there
is
a
sweetness
on
the
back
of
the
nose
that
is
rather
nice
holy
cow
this
tastes
so
much
better
than
it
smells
the
flavors
are
slight
sour
and
fairly
sweet
its
really
nice

the

really

its
a
pretty

you

i

this
beer
to

would

this

yes
but
a

its
an

the

its

that

from

the

the

i
did

a

caramel
mixed

well
providing
a

sweet
balance
to
it
the
only
downside
would
have
to
be
the
lightness
of
the
aroma
needed
a
little
more
kick
the
flavor
was
very
well
rounded

with
a
nice
punch

a
decent
roasted

d
this
is
a
great
use
of
rye
and
is
not
one
that
is
overpowering
i
can
see
drinking
this
again
the
flavors
are
nice
but
the
beer
is
a
bit
too
sweet
overall
and
i
think
that
any
flavors
contributed
by
the

malts
are
overpowered
by
the

overall
not
what
i
was
really
expecting
overall
but
really
enjoyed
my
first
of
this
style
the
rye
and
sweeter
malts
play
along
well
together
here
i
highly
recommend
letting
this
brew
warm
a
touch
as
that
opens
up
a
ton
of
the
dark
fruits
and
herbal
notes
this
is
pretty
much
alcoholic
kvass
its
the
same
bright
refreshing
crispness
with
the
distinctive
slight
tartness
and
spiciness
unlike
traditional
kvass
the
hops
keep
this
from
being
sweet
i
really
like
it
overall
though
its
very
drinkable
wellcrafted
and
undoubtedly
interesting
its
not
as
complex
as
it
could
have
been
i
feel
but
who
am
i
to
say
what
a
roggenbier
should
be
at
least
now
i
have
a
legitimate
benchmark
o
i
would
say
this
beer
is
the
definition
of
rustic
hearty
and
messy
which
does
seem
to
hinder
greater
definition
of
the
complexity
of
the
individual
flavors
this
was
right
up
my
alley
and
certainly
something
i
will
try
again
soon
to
see
what
else
it
may
reveal
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
body
with
a
spicy
rye
presence
thats
countered
by
some
sweet
malt
before
a
lingering
buttery
diaceytl
presence
comes
in
on
the
back
end
peppery
spice
and
rye
followed
by
bready
yeast
caramel
malt
toffee
and
biscuit
but
the
finish
is
really
buttery
metallic
and
astringent
even
without
this
the
rye
is
kind
of
tame
and
the
malt
profile
needs
a
touch
more
sweetness
the
odd
flavors
in
the
finish
make
it
really
harsh
and
unpleasant
tough
to
finish
not
sure
how
i
feel
as
this
is
my
first
roggenbier
its
a
different
type
of
funk
and
im
trying
to
be
openminded
in
the
end
you
feel
like
you
are
drinking
a
living
thing
one
on
the
edge
of
decay
it
feels
like
it
has
some
age
and
the
qualities
that
exist
have
been
nurtured
out
of
the
brewing
process
very
interesting
and
worth

try

the
curious

adventurous
poured

tulip

dark
burnt
caramel
amber
with

half

light
tan
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
leaving

lacing
aroma
of
rich
caramel
malt
cooked
caramel
nuts
and
a
hint
of
rye
sourness
flavor
is
lighter
caramel
and
light
toasted
malt
rye
with
light
rye
sourness
flavor
is
light
compared
to
the
aroma
and
harder
to
determine
because
of
very
active
and
peppery
carbonation
which
was
not
obvious
in
the
pour
but
sadly
detracts
from
the
intensity
of
flavor
light
to
medium
bodied
an
interesting
traditional
rye
ale
that
is
so
actively
carbonated
that
it
is
hard
to
savor
the
somewhat
subtle
flavors
the
rye
and
caramel
malts
are
nicely
balanced
and
this
is
a
tasty
rye
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
have
savored
a
bit
more
this
beer
is
quite
sour
far
more
than
the
smell
would
lead
one
to
expect
the
more
roasted
malts
are
lost
in
thisits
not
extreme
just
dominating
think
sweettart
without
the
sweet
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
are
more
of
the
same
the
body
leans
to
the
thin
side
while
the
carbonation
is
quite
high
overall
just
a
little
bit
above
average
if
this
is
typical
for
the
style
it
is
not
a
style
i
will
be
pursuing
i
would
like
to
try
other
examples
though
i
would
give
it
a
try
if
youve
never
had
a
roggenbier
but
i
would
pass
if
you
have
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
a
style
i
dont
see
as
often
as
id
like
definitely
something
different
and
refreshing
it
was
just
missing
too
much
body
and
the
flavours
only
really
came
through
on
the
initial
sip
definitely
try
this
one
if
your
up
for
a
lighter
feeling
rye
beer
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
o
not
a
bad
beer
if
a
bit
on
the
uneven
side
still
pretty
drinkable
tangy
and
flat
mild
maltiness
and
an
offputting
twang
that
is
either
from
rye
malt
or
a
sign
of
infection
thin
lifeless
feel
like
uncarbonated
wort
mild
flavors
light
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
sort
of
basic
the
carbonation
and
tanginess
seem
to
be
flaws
that
make
this
one
to
pass
on
NA
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
iron
hill
very
drinkable
o
very
nice
i
am
glad
i
started
with
this
one
i
typically
dont
enjoy
too
many
chewy
beers
but
this
one
was
a
revelation
i
really
liked
the
flavors
and
it
never
got
to
the
point
of
being
overpowering
great
stuff
similar
but
distinct
from
the
draft
version
the
softer
carbonation
and
lack
of
c02
brings
out
the
rye
spiciness
much
stronger
than
the
draft
pour
is
similar
to
draft
opaque
and
murky
copper
brown
with
a
bubbly
fleeting
clear
head
initially
has
traditional
dunkelweiss
flavors
clove
fruit
banana
and
yeast
the
rye
spice
and
breadiness
of
the
caraway
i
liked
the
base
and
i
like
this
treatment
even
more
ive
only
previously
had
troegs
scratch
roggen
but
im
very
impressed
by
both
versions
of
iron
hills
m
a
sweet
mouthfeel
that
yoyos
between
weizen
and
rye
super
added
awesomeness
points
for
the
caraway
o
this
is
becoming
a
favorite
style
of
mine
one
i
rarely
get
to
try
unfortunately
this
was
well
worth
ending
my
long
standing
boycott
of
iron
hill
growlers
for
in
fact
ill
probably
go
back
for
another
fill
of
my
new
ih
screw
top
a
very
tasty
rye
beer
poured
a
cloudy
burnt
sienna
with
a
healthy
white
head
that
retained
well
light
spices
and
banana
aroma
toasted
malts
up
front
on
the
taste
very
organic
and
earthy
with
a
thick
banana
taste
coming
through
and
rye
sourness
in
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
spice
smooth
medium
body
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
nice
alternative
to
a
hefe
i
like
how
the
rye
is
there
but
not
too
overpowering
a
sipper
due
to
its
heaviness
but
a
beer
i
would
like
to
have
again
d
easy
drinker
for
the
change
of
winter
to
spring
sourness
is
balanced
and
does
not
build
very
hazy
caramel
colour
topped
by
a
short
cap
of
offwhite
foam
good
head
retention
the
aroma
was
mostly
bread
crust
with
some
spicy
rye
and
mild
banana
character
mild
bitterness
with
sweet
caramel
rye
and
mild
banana
notes
throughout
bread
crust
appeared
at
the
end
and
it
finished
quickly
with
a
burst
of
spicy
rye
slick
oily
texture
with
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
body
a
little
creamy
quite
an
enjoyable
pint
lots
of
interesting
flavours
are
present
but
they
dont
tire
the
palate
if
this
shows
up
again
definitely
try
it

description
this
is
a
solid
beer
overall
bear
republic
know
how
to
brew
with
rye
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
still
prefer
german
versions
of
this
style
but
would
pick
this
up
again
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
malt
profile
enhanced
by
all
of
those
nice
aromatic
spices
the
robust
nose
also
helped
lend
an
appreciation
to
the
malt
profile
but
in
the
end
the
flavoring
was
a
bit
thin
around
the
edges
the
total
refinement
was
simply
not
there
all
while
missing
those
big
characteristic
rye
inclusions
i
appreciate
having
this
experience
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
but
i
like
that
i
was
able
to
get
to
try
this
new
beer
style
i
really
did
like
this
beer
almost
as
much
as
the
change
in
kims
demeanor
she
was
quite
pleasant
tonight
and
once
we
got
used
to
it
it
was
pretty
refreshing
the
same
can
be
said
of
this
beer
if
you
get
used
to
the
rye
coming
through
then
youll
find
this
pretty
refreshing
as
well
pours
a
bright
copper
color
with
a
big
white
head
a
good
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
is
mildly
herbal
with
some
fruity
notes
and
something
like
bread
dough
the
taste
is
a
little
spicy
with
banana
notes
and
some
sweetness
like
shortbread
a
little
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
its
crisp
for
an
ale
with
good
carbonation
and
a
thinnish
body
a
very
nice
beer
incredibly
easy
to
drink
ill
get
this
if
i
see
it
again
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brownish
amber
color
there
is
about
a
finger
of
white
head
resting
on
top
the
head
has
good
retention
and
there
is
some
scattered
lace
left
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
good
bit
of
rye
and
spices
there
is
also
fruity
juiciness
to
the
nose
as
well
as
some
banana
i
am
getting
a
little
bit
of
yeastiness
as
well
the
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
well
it
starts
off
with
some
rye
and
maltiness
there
is
a
nice
fruitiness
and
banana
flavor
there
is
some
clove
and
other
spices
present
as
well
as
some
yeastiness
and
a
mild
hop
presence
on
the
back
end
the
finish
leaves
some
lingering
rye
and
spices
behind
on
the
palate
this
has
a
medium
body
and
the
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
side
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
really
nice
smooth
feel
to
it
there
is
some
rye
spiciness
and
some
fruity
sweetness
to
it
there
is
a
really
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
it
has
a
nice
refreshing
quality
to
it
this
has
really
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
really
easy
and
has
a
really
nice
flavor
overall
i
think
this
is
a
just
a
solid
easy
going
beer
it
is
almost
like
a
rye
hefeweizen
this
is
my
first
roggenbier
but
i
am
definitely
looking
forward
to
trying
more
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
one
out
i
would
buy
more
of
this
one
o
clean
and
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
but
not
super
flavorful
o
this
is
the
first
and
only
roggenbier
i
have
ever
had
i
am
looking
forward
to
tying
a
few
more
served
out
of
a
pitcher
at
the
brewpub
in
healdsburg
very
nice
appearance
with
lacing
that
runs
down
the
glass
not
an
overbearing
rye
smell
but
enough
to
take
notice
a
welcome
change
when
one
gets
tired
of
all
the
great
ipas
in
the
area
and
a
great
choice
when
3
or
4
beers
are
whats
called
for
nice
to
see
an
underrated
style
get
put
on
tap
and
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
their
patio
glad
we
got
it
instead
of
2
pitchers
of
racer
5
just
seems
like
a
beer
that
is
kinda
weird
for
the
sake
of
being
weird
a
nice
rye
flavor
blended
with
a
good
yeast
profile
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
almost
three
fingers
of
head
that
actually
sat
upright
over
the
rim
of
the
pint
glass
smells
of
straw
and
peppery
rye
taste
is
wheat
lemon
and
rye
as
this
is
the
only
roggenbier
i
have
ever
tried
im
impressed
with
the
combination
of
sweet
and
peppery
the
rye
really
comes
through
as
the
beer
warms
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
not
sure
i
would
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
glad
i
had
it
while
on
the
west
coast
hugely
quaffable
and
perfect
for
a
lunch
on
the
patio
during
the
summer
a
very
nice
beer
in
fact
i
sipped
from
a
friends
sampler
of
bear
republics
other
beers
and
id
choose
this
over
any
other
at
least
on
this
day
o
the
beer
isnt
impossible
to
drink
but
seems
like
it
is
an
acquired
taste
enjoyed
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
medium
yellow
colour
with
minimal
white
head
sharp
apple
is
how
the
taste
comes
off
average
mouthfeel
not
very
drinkable
a
bit
of
spicy
nose
featuring
the
rye
a
little
yeast
that
contributes
little
would
like
less
cloves
more
hop
i
loved
this
one
overall
a
tasty
and
refreshing
rye
ale

just
right
spices
here
its
not
quite
winter

the
warmth

hit
the
spot
hints
of

coffee
vanilla

with
the
maltiness

spot
on
when

temperature
starts
to
slip

flying

roggen
is
a
spicy
beer
that
i
think
pairs
really
well
with
food
while
a
bit
onenoted
it
is
a
flavorful
bold
beer
that
seems
at
least
to
me
to
punch
above
its
weight
in
terms
of
flavor
to
abv
ratio
i
enjoyed
it
well
enough
though
two
in
a
rowbecause
of
the
rye
centric
flavormight
be
a
little
too
difficult
to
pull
off
notes
very
hazy
brass
body
beneath
a
twofingerthick

of
white
very
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
a

phenolic
a
bit
of
banana
and
some
slightly
burnt

mildly
caramelish

perhaps

not
much

given
the

cheers
truly
a
nice
likeable
beer
d
pretty
fresh
and
drinkable
worth
finding
this
one
d
absolutely
in
case
someone
ask
me
one
day
whats
a
wheat
beer
i
would
definitely
give
it
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
ful
and
refreshing
similar
to
a
wheat
very
drinkable
but
hey
its
bio
yeah
sarcasm
pours
a
cloudy
pinkish
gold
under
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
to
film
and
collar
leaving
no
appreciable
lace
the
nose
is
strong
and
enticing
full
of
plum
and
a
bit
of
candy
the
mouth
is
light
and
very
prickly
interesting
and
unusual
taste
with
lots
of
yeast
and
slightly
sour
fruit
the
hops
are
very
subdued
at
first
but
come
on
strong
at
the
swallow
dry
and
bitter
the
yeasty
sour
fruitiness
reminds
of
a
hefeweizen
but
this
is
heavier
and
much
more
bitter
definitely
refreshing
this
brew
demands
slow
enjoyment

at
that

disregard
those

perfectly
nice
plenty
of
spice
decent
body
reasonable
depth
just
not
especially
a
rye
beer
no
closer
to
having
insight
into
this

d
a
light
refreshing
profile
just
a
bit
thin
in
the
flavour
profile
and
poor
appearance
possibly
due
to
age
will
need
to
revisit
with
a
fresh
version
tastewell
lets
just
call
it
pretty
hollow
so
disappointingly
little
stuffing
that
it
borders
on
anorexic
there
is
a
slight
trace
of
dark
mealiness
but
in
general
it
is
just
dominated
by
a
flavour
of
bubble
gum
ends
with
a
degree
of
sweeetness
but
it
just
lacks
density
weight
and
substance
great
bbq
beer
nothing
too
exciting
here
im
glad
i
found
this
roggen
though
i
was
expecting
something
with
more
spicy
rye
flavor
d
pretty
fresh
and
drinkable
especially
in
summer
season
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
d
very
interesting
beer
that
i
think
everyone
should
give
at
least
a
try
a
little
bit
for
everyone
in
the
flavor
of
it
cola
black
with
a
nice
pearly
champagne
coloured
head
that
rises
above
the
lip
of
the
glass
like
bread
but
then
collapses
like
soufflé
nicely
layered
aroma
with
chocolate
and
raisins
coupling
with
honey
and
rye
flavour
is
similar
lightly
fruity
and
full
of
earthy
bready
rye
flavor
nuances
of
cherry
banana
bread
and
walnuts
appear
as
well
dry
and
somewhat
fizzy
and
ultimately
quite
interesting
and
drinkable
the
body
is
for
it
quite
light
with
a
pleasant
caramel
spicy
notes
on
the
sweet
but
not
heavy
at
all
its
a
style
i
hope
to
revisit
someday
although
this
beer
and
the
paulaner
version
rumored
to
be
identical
are
the
only
common
examples
we
were
in
regensburg
and
the
women
were
doing
a
little
shopping
i
spied
a
courtyard
entrance
with
a
roggen
sign
next
to
it
so
i
told
them
to
find
me
inside
there
was
a
shaded
courtyard
with
a
fountain
and
i
plopped
myself
down
and
ordered
one
it
came
in
the
prettiest
12
liter
goblet
which
you
can
see
on
the
t
t
website
and
made
this
beer
all
the
more
enjoyable
very
dark
ruby
in
the
glass
with
a
generous
head
which
eventually
faded
away
to
a
tawny
ring
there
were
nice
banana
and
clove
smells
even
with
the
full
body
this
beer
was
a
little
drier
than
i
expected
i
took
my
time
with
this
one
enjoying
the
a
lingering
finish
id
have
liked
to
have
tried
another
but
had
to
move
on
a
wonderful
beer
drinking
memory
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
roggen
style
taste
is
caramellic
with
a
clean
yeast
profile
there
is
no
bitter
and
body
is
thin
which
takes
away
the
attention
of
the
nice
taste
again
i
do
not
get
any
roggen
maybe
a
little
oiliness
but
this
just
guessing
i
want
to
believe
mouthfeel
is
velvet
smooth
the
thin
body
is
a
real
turndown
every
sip
starts
out
good
untill
i
swallow
and
find
very
little
body
and
aftertaste

note
my
bottle
listed
4
7abv
in
all
it
lived
up
to
expectations
and
was
worth
the
search
effort
aside
from
the
winey
flavor
which
i
assume
shouldnt
be
there
it
seemed
like
what
a
german
lager
style
brown
ale
would
be
slight
toasted
malt
character
with
some
rye
roughedgedness
fairly
clean
and
dry
hops
come
through
lightly
in
the
finish
serving
mostly
to
cut
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
carbonation
is
mild
particularly
for
a
german
style
tasty
even
though
i
think
it
was
past
its
prime
id
definitely
like
to
try
this
again
when
i
know
its
fresh
hazy
very
darkorangehoney
color
with
a
huge
tannish
rocky
head
that
drops
shortly
after
pouring
but
leaves
an
excellent
collar
and
some
good
lace
unusual
aroma
a
citrusy
weizenlike
character
along
with
some
mintiness
i
assume
from
rye
the
body
is
mediumlight
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
that
gives
a
zest
on
the
tongue
and
a
drying
grainy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
more
subdued
that
might
be
expected
starting
with
a
crisp
bitterness
showing
some
smoky
chararacter
and
spiciness
along
with
some
softly
sweet
fruit
notes
as
it
crosses
the
palate
and
finishing
dry
and
clean
theres
a
lot
of
complexity
here
but
its
not
readily
apparent
a
different
beer
sweet
spicyness
definitely
with
a
