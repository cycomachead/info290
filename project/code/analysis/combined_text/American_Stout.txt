8

beers
taste
is
dominated
by
roasted
malt
although
it
may
be
more
appropriate
to
call
it
burnt
malt
has
a
very
bitter
burnt
flavor
running
throughout
that
controls
everything
not
sure
coffee
contributes
much
to
the
burnt
bitterness
since
its
not
overly
coffee
flavored
but
the
bitterness
is
similar
to
a
dark
cup
of
joe
mediumlow
carbonation
with
decent
stickiness
some
cocoa
peaks
its
head
near
the
finish
along
with
some
sweetness
after
the

wears
off
enough
overall
this
is

very

not
super
complex
roast

the

then
midpalate
hints
of
vanilla
and
caramel
enter
in
with
roast
flavors
dominating
by
the
finish
as
chocolate
flavors
wrapped
in
a
range
of
grain
flavors
linger
long
through
the
aftertaste
finishes
dry
with
a
touch
of
roast
astringency
bitterness
tastes
as
much
from
the
roast
and
dark
chocolate
than
from
hops
very
creamy

dry
roast
is
the
dominant
flavour
some
liquorice
remains
along
with
the
coffee
just
a
solid
big
stout
all
around
the
body
is
a
bit
thinner
than
most
stouts
like
this
but
the
flavor
works
out
just
fine
with
the
texture
heavily
toasted
nuts
burnt
grains

bitter
cocoa

fine

it

with
a
bitter

flavor
and
sweetness
that
has
a
slightly
burnt

character
to
it
the
middle
is
effervescent
and
brings
forth
a
light
roast
bitterness
over
a
nice

sweetness
that
has
a

character
the

is
a

a
solid
offering
from
left
coast
a
brewery
i
have
never
tried
before
now
pours

that
dies

a

bitterness

mouthfeel
with
an
almost
grit
to
it
from
an
overload
of
cocoa
solid
beer
but
not
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
stout
still
very
happy
to
have
tried
it
will
try
again
later
and
see
if
tastes
have
changed
though
i
doubt
it
overall
a
mediocre
imperial
stout
nothing
really
made
this
brew
stand
out
overall
giving
this
a
4
i
do
love
a
nice
pitch
black
stout
pretty
tasty
most
of
the
stuff
from
left
coast
that
ive
had
is
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
never
bad
just
not
crisp
and
sharp
always
little
things
keeping
it
from
scoring
better
and
this
is
no
different
its
a
good
beer
and
something
id
happily
drink
again
poured
a
deep
rich
black
with
a
onefinger
tan
head
that
left
slight
lacing
it
looks
like
a
good
american
stout
scents
of
rich
roast
malt
roasted
black
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
powder
an
excellent
true
to
style
aroma
profile
for
an
american
stout
but
not
standout
flavor
begins
with
rich
roast
malt
slight
black
coffee
and
some
toffee
sweetness
moves
into
a
more
aggressive
roasted
malt
flavor
more
roasted
black
coffee
and
more
toffee
with
some
cocoa
and
dark
chocolate
and
molasses
in
the
background
finish
is
of
roasted
black
coffee
bitter
roasted

and
bitter

yet
standard
american
stout
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
true
to
style
no
complaints
overall
this
is
a
good
very
true
to
style
american
a
stout
not
fantastic
but
still
a
good
drinking
beer
with
a
nice
aroma
while
not
rich
and
large
like
most
stouts
quite
flavorful
even
for
a
wet
body
nice
fun
beer
looks
fairly
blackish
on
the
pour
smell
is
of
sweet
roast
barley
coffee
sweet
cream
and
chocolate
taste
is
basically
the
same
as
the
nose
but
a
real
milk
stout
feel
going
on
very
delicious
and
certainly
will
be
bought
again
this
is
an
accomplishment
o
a
tasty
well
done
stout
very
easy
to
drink
the
color
is
rich
and
dark
the
head
is
thick
too
but
it
dissolves
quickly
and
the
lacing
is
mediocre
its
smooth
and
light
in
the
mouth
with
less
coffeebitterness
in
the
actual
flavor
than
the
aroma
wouldnt
mind
a
stronger
hint
of
malt
or
nuts
this
is
one
that
tastes
better
when
fresh
compared
to
others
that
even
out
their
flavors
after
sitting
a
bit
i
enjoy
it
and
could
make
a
night
of
it
poured
a
black
body
with
minor
head
on
top
of
an
aroma
that
is
thick
of
roasted
malts
bordering
on
coffee
at
times
touch
of
dark
chocolate
simple
not
complex
stout
but
pretty
tasty
and
enjoyable
chewey
slightly
sticky
body
that
is
a
little
boozy
and
has
some
minor
chocolate
sweetness
and
a
whole
of
roasted
malts
although
not
picking
up
a
hint
of
coffee
as
i
did
in
the
aroma
goes
down
nice
with
no
problems
and
is
a
fine
beer
to
have
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
coloring
with
a
thin
sparse
light
tan
surface
coat
of
head
aromas
of
subtle
coffee
cream
sweetness
chocolate
highlights
and
hints
of
vanilla
smells
great
flavors
are
smooth
and
creamy
initially
with
a
solid
blast
of
roast
and
bitter
coffee
in
the
backbone
extremely
balanced
with
a
smoothness
as
it
travels
over
the
palate
light
bodied
but
it
never
loses
that
smooth
touch
transitioning
to
a
roasted
and
more
heavily
bittered
coffee
aftertaste
the
finish
is
bitter
and
dry
with
a
roasted
linger
solid
beer
and
the
light
body
makes
it
very
drinkable
overall
nice
little
stout
defiantly
worth
trying
but
not
kick
ass
enough
for
regular
consumption
o
a
really
well
done
stout
just
wish
it
had
a
better
mouth
feel
the
taste
pretty
much
makes
up
for
it
though
and
despite
its
flaws
this
one
gets
it
more
right
than
wrong
ill
buy
again
o
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
i
love
a
good
imperial
stout
overall
above
average
to
good
but
mostly
good
beer
does
nothing
that
really
stands
out
but
has
no
flaws
and
is
very
accessible
i
would
give
this
a
try
and
i
might
buy
it
again
overall
its
pretty
tasty
pours
a
luscious
dark
black
hue
with
a
creamy
one
finger
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
dark
roasted
coffeechocolate
maltsmilk
chocolate
and
a
slight
herbalnessthe
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
slightly
carbonated
and
the
tastes
are
dark
and
milky
chocolate
mixed
with
dark
espresso
and
finished
with
a
mix
of
roastiness
and
herbal
hoppiness
and
overall
a
great
drop
that
i
could
drink
alnight
a
classic
dessert
beer
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
but
not
balanced
imo
glad
i
tried
it
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
were
offered
but
would
choose
something
else
myself
o
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
as
a
stout
but
thats
a
possible
upside
for
others
most
of
the
sweetness
quickly
disappears
in
the
finish
leaving
toasted
wood
and
coffee
overall
this
stout
is
pretty
solid
very
decent
roasted
malt
flavors
with
a
nice
touch
of
bitter
chocolate
if
complexity
youre
looking
for
this
one
is
a
little
tamed
just
to
the
point
stout
the
aroma
for
me
is
the
highlight
on
this
brew
i
thought
i
was
baking
a
german
chocolate
cake
while
brewing
some
morning
coffee
this
is
very
drinkable
for
being
8
5
abv
this
one
just
doesnt
scream
excellence
to
me
imo
this
brew
is
worthy
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twentytwo
ounce
brown
glass
bomber
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
served
in
a
tulip
glass
from
a
bottle
pours
black
with
a
small
head
a
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
coffee
with
some
chocolate
the
roasted
malt
flavor
enhances
the
mouth
feel
and
taste
i
was
just
expecting
more
depth
a
well
done
stout
from
my
tasting
notes
this
beer
was
big
and
robust
that
poured
a
deep
black
with
a
decent
fluffy
head
the
taste
was
outstanding
with
loads
of
sweet
malts
and
a
big
burnt
chocolate
bitter
dark
chocolate
flavor
that
sustained
itself
nicely
the
full
creamy
mouthfeel
kept
this
substantial
brew
thick
and
satisfying
the
voodoo
stout
was
a
fantastic
stout
and
one
i
would
drink
again
and
again
o
fairly
average
stout
all
the
flavors
work
well
together
and
it
tastes
good
its
warming
but
theres
no
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
still
though
pretty
average
very
pleasant
coffee
and
malts
up
front
but
there
is
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
i
find
a
little
unsettling
still
not
a
bad
example
of
american
stout
voo
doo
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
but
lacing
head
there
is
a
smokey
aroma
with
strong
coffee
and
roasted
notes
the
taste
is
much
the
same
lots
of
roasted
and
coffee
flavors
good
and
full
bodied
and
flavorful
overall
a
very
nice
enjoyable
stout
pretty
drinkable
run
of
the
mill
somewhere
between
stout
and
export
stout
not
really
my
thing
o
a
very
good
stout
one
of
my
personal
favorites
up
to
this
point
will
definitely
drink
again
if
the
opportunity
arises
overall
i
like
it
the
earthy
note
isnt
where
i
like
my
hops
but
theres
nothing
wrong
here
its
well
made
the
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
are
pretty
far
in
the
background
left
coast
knows
what
they
are
doing
recommended
its
a
good
beer
one
i
would
drink
again
if
it
was
poured
for
me
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
order
or
buy
unless
it
was
on
sale
not
bad
by
any
means
but
really
doesnt
hit
my
worldclass
mark
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
stout
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
better
alternatives
within
the
style
i
would
try
one
more
as
i
thought
it
was
a
bad
batch
glad
i
split
one
beer
with
two
other
people
drinks
well
for
8
overall
a
pretty
solid
stout
more
like
an
imperial
stout
with
a
pretty
rich
and
roasty
profile
o
its
a
good
middle
of
the
road
stout
nothing
fancy
here
the
voo
do
stout
is
a
decent
stout
from
left
coast
the
beer
poured
a
deep
opaque
black
with
minimal
ecru
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
scent
carries
roast
and
espresso
the
taste
is
powered
by
espresso
with
warming
essence
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
subtle
carbonation
overall
a
very
decent
stout
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
reasonable
price
and
has
a
very
unique
taste
i
will
have
to
buy
it
again
overall
good
solid
stout
nothing
truly
noteworthy
but
id
have
no
problem
drinking
it
again
if
there
werent
better
options
available
good
average
stout
something
i
would
recommend
to
a
beer
drinker
that
is
just
starting
out
this
would
be
a
nice
mellow
introduction
to
the
style
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
for
anybody
who
looking
for
something
complex
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
dont
think
its
super
unique
but
nonetheless
a
solid
beer
definitely
recommend
trying
it
the
taste
was
perfect
and
the
rest
of
the
beer
supported
it
well
o
seems
to
be
between
a
regular
stout
and
an
imperial
stout
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
im
taking
off
a
point
because
its
a
bit
pricey
and
i
could
spend
1
more
for
a
much
better
imperial
stout
grab
this
if
you
can
get
it
for
cheap
35
a
fairly
one
dimensional
stout
that
only
delivers
if
youre
really
into
bitter
roasted
malt
flavors
its
drinkable
but
not
much
more
than
that
ive
had
several
left
coast
beers
now
and
im
just
not
very
impressed
by
them
no
date
on
the
bottle
but
comes
off
fresh
enough
for
my
liking
dont
know
that
age
would
improve
this
one
too
much
another
solid
beer
from
left
coast
would
buy
again
at
the
sub
5
price
tag
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
char
and
some
slight
cocoa
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
decent
stout
smells
and
looks
great
nothing
really
special
though
there
are
so
many
great
stouts
out
there
that
the
voo
doo
is
middle
of
the
pack
at
best
all
stouts
pretty
much
look
the
same
so
lets
move
to
aroma
there
was
an
odd
chemical
component
to
the
voo
doo
aroma
which
was
a
low
point
flavor
was
ample
in
chocolate
and
vanilla
but
dry
and
rough
around
the
edges
an
ok
beer
overall
but
with
so
many
other
wonderful
stouts
to
drink
i
will
not
reach
for
a
voo
doo
again
a
good
stoudt
to
be
had
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
chocolate
and
heavily
roasted
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
cream
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
similar
there
is
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
smoke
along
with
a
ton
of
chocolate
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
straightforward
stout
that
is
easy
to
drink
d
it
is
what
it
is
a
solid
but
unexceptional
american
stout
that
probably
lingered
on
a
shelf
for
too
long
for
its
lower
abv
to
warrant
probably
wouldnt
bother
revisiting
this
even
if
i
could
find
a
fresher
example
shame
on
left
coast
for
not
bottle
dating
doa
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
stout
and
i
would
not
hesitate
to
get
it
again
overall
i
would
get
it
again
but
im
not
in
a
rush
did
i
mention
burnt
a
liked
this
a
bit
more
than
i
did
d
next
please
sorry
22
oz
bomber
pours
a
opaque
black
with
huge
lovely
head
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malt
and
alcohol
taste
is
coffee
slight
chocolate
licorice
and
alcohol
creamy
but
thin
mouthfeel
is
lacking
that
strong
bite
you
expect
from
stouts
this
one
got
better
as
it
warmed
but
overall
weak
flavored
lets
see
this
beer
is
roasty
and
uh
roasty
with
some
roast
up
front
and
then
hmm
roasty
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
dark
intimidating
appearance
and
a
nose
of
burnt
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
flavor
is
basic
but
again
burnt
coffee
unsweetened
chocolate
earthy
malt
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
if
this
what
an
american
stout
taste
like
then
fck
american
stouts
no
really
this
beer
gives
america
and
stouts
a
bad
name
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
stout
but
this
beer
taste
weird
like
fckin
playdough
avoid
at
all
cost
dont
be
fooled
try
any
other
stout
but
this
shit
o
very
roasty
but
an
average
stout
easy
drinking
and
smooth
love
the
bottle
art
not
bad
nice
enough
but
not
quite
enough
omphhh
user
friendly
but
not
knockem
sockem
robots
overall
those
wellroasted
black
patent
type
malts
just
always
seem
to
bring
a
bit
of
harshness
to
the
beer
which
im
never
too
enthusiastic
about
still
its
a
decent
enough
stout
drinkable
but
hardly
sessionable
at
8
5
abv
my
bottle
says
6
8
it
drinks
more
like
an
imperial
however
so
maybe
it
is
8
5
as
stated
on
the
left
coast
website
o
a
decent
stout
overall
the
flavor
fades
a
little
too
quickly
for
my
liking
and
i
kept
reaching
for
more
to
keep
the
ride
going
thick
rich
malty
with
some
punch
and
the
consistency
of
motor
oil
very
good
what
a
stout
should
be
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
stout
glass
forms
a
thick
head
that
dissipates
reasonably
quickly
this
stout
has
a
decent
aroma
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
certain
tanginess
that
may
not
be
to
everyones
liking
but
that
i
enjoyed
o
pretty
decent
stout
worth
a
try
and
would
drink
again
in
the
future
pour
a
deep
dark
brownishblack
leaving
a
thick
and
dirty
looking
layer
of
head
immediate
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
beans
which
brings
us
to
what
happens
in
the
palate
coffee
is
definitely
present
along
with
a
bitter
dark
chocolate
somewhat
a
creamier
beer
that
was
a
touch
thinner
than
russian
imperials
that
ive
enjoyed
in
the
past
overall
though
a
pretty
decent
offering
overall
a
decent
stout
with
hints
of
chocolate
a
very
basic
stout
nothing
extraordinary
o
pretty
basic
stout
but
strong
in
alcohol
a
little
onedimensional
worth
a
try
though
for
stout
enthusiasts
overall
a
very
nice
stout
the
smell
promises
more
than
the
taste
delivers
but
i
will
buy
this
again
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
taste
doing
a
complete
180
from
the
smell
and
appearance
first
sip
brought
forth
an
extemporaneous
hmmm
wtf
is
this
nearly
all
of
the
sweetness
disappears
and
the
roast
is
a
bit
excessive
hops
are
flavorful
and
even
a
bit
resinous
so
if
that
is
your
thing
this
beer
might
be
for
you
i
prefer
my
stouts
creamy
full
and
on
the
sweeterchocolaty
side
this
one
does
not
manage
to
capture
any
of
those
adjectives
not
that
it
is
all
bad
ill
still
finish
the
bomber
fairly
easily
but
i
wont
buy
this
again
and
in
a
loaded
style
category
it
pretty
much
falls
flat
on
its
face
this
beer
has
a
killer
looking
bottle
was
bought
for
me
as
a
birthday
gift
i
split
the
bottle
with
the
friends
who
bought
it
for
me
the
color
was
black
and
had
a
sticky
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
set
was
very
minimal
just
a
light
roasted
aroma
the
taste
was
roasted
with
some
burnt
malt
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
smooth
has
a
little
thickness
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
dark
black
pours
with
a
small
brownred
head
smells
of
roasted
coffee
and
come
chocolate
and
the
taste
follows
through
on
that
but
gets
a
little
unbalanced
and
overbearing
its
a
bit
heavy
to
handle
though
id
like
to
try
it
again
and
revisit
it
beer
is
creamy
and
buttery
in
a
bad
way
with
chocolate
and
strong
coffeeish
roast
something
went
wrong
with
an
otherwise
good
beer
interesting
overall
but
it
seems
to
have
diacetyl
problem
fix
it
and
ill
have
ti
again
overall
this
stout
left
me
underwhelmed
i
was
looking
forward
to
something
with
a
bit
more
heft
on
it
and
was
disappointed
it
was
just
too
watery
for
my
total
enjoyment
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
or
something
happened
with
it
being
shipped
over
seas
but
i
would
probably
never
buy
another
bottle
of
this
sorry
left
coast
but
i
gave
it
a
shot
not
a
very
good
experience
with
this
particular
brew
pours
near
black
with
a
short
mocha
head
and
a
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
brings
a
good
amount
of
chocolate
along
with
some
coffee
and
a
fairlystrong
roast
component
the
flavor
has
the
same
characteristics
but
also
has
the
unwelcome
addition
of
diacetyl
which
isnt
overpowering
but
does
a
good
deal
to
kill
the
flavor
profile
of
the
beer
medium
body
with
a
fairlydry
finish
d
very
good
the
beer
is
simple
straightforward
and
delicious
id
love
to
have
on
tap
thanks
chief
this
was
a
fairly
decent
stout
not
perfect
but
very
drinkable
overdone
on
the
maltinyourface
this
is
comparable
to
a
scalded
french
roast
cheap
bitter
but
drinkable
and
a
potent
delivery
vehicle
for
your
favorite
legal
drug
d
very
smooth
if
you
gotta
have
big
welltoasted
malts
its
spoton
it
does
get
tiring
if
you
find
one
of
these
bottles
split
it
with
a
buddy
worth
the
try

its
limited

inexpensive

whatever
is

incredibly
well
done
overall
liked
it
was
drawn
to
the
beer
by
vanilla
chocolate
elements
advertised
however
this
is
not
my
most
favourite
stout
overall
not
bad
i
would
rather
drink
a
smoother
and
richer
expedition
stout
i
dont
know
why
i
compared
it
to
the
expedition
but
i
did
chalky
dark
chocolate
is
here
o
a
great
beer
with
fantastic
flavors
and
complexity
no
faults
and
some
nice
bold
flavors
grab
it
if
you
see
it
as
the
experience
is
worth
it
we
used
it
for
a
5course
beer
pairing
night
at
the
restaurant
though
it
is
great
on
its
own
we
paired
it
to
a
simple
lemon
creme
brulee
the
beer
turned
into
cold
espresso
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
the
combination
was
one
of
the
best
pairing
wine
included
experiences
of
my
life
d
damn
this
is
a
tasty
stout
i
love
the
flavors
and
the
fact
that
it
is
6
5
vs
9
5
like
a
ris
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
not
a
ris
but
it
has
a
lot
of
the
same
complexities
very
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
wish
i
had
got
a
whole
6
pack
highly
recommended
pours
a
nice
dark
colour
with
a
reddish
head
nose
is
rather
subdued
i
think
this
might
be
an
age
issue
its
nice
cocoa
and
faint
vanilla
tastes
a
little
smokey
and
nice
dryness
on
the
end
another
damn
good
beer
from
these
guys
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
are
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
stout
roastiness
at
a
lower
abv
its
decadent
yet
highly
drinkable
i
could
put
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
highly
hiiiighly

a

charred

light

the

carries
through
the
finish
with
some
bitterness
extremely
full

creamy
soft
and
still
has
a
moderate
amount
of
carb
to
it
another
dieu
du

beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
was
highly
drinkable
from
the
start
with
a
good
mix
of
dark
malts
chocolate
sweetness
and
hints
of
coffee
and
fruits
all
combining
very
well
indeed
whilst
not
quite
a
classic
it
was
a
very
good
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
again
if
it
were
a
little
easier
to
find
in
the
uk
still
its
one
well
worth
picking
up

you

would

drinking
as
much
beer
as
i
am
now
had
i
never
drank
this
one
o
a
rather
sessionable
stout
id
maybe
go
for
a
second
if
i
had
one
i
think
ill
pick
this
up
again
its
a
real
goto
stout
like
the
st
ambroise
oatmeal
stout
however
this
is
better
overall
great
stout
from
a
great
brewery
ive
had
a
few
stouts
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
if
you
add
a
shot
of
a
good
port
it
would
make
for
a
good
bloody
aphrodisiaque
im
still
debating
whether
it
would
make
a
good
aphrodisiaque
float
with
a
scoop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
but
i
dont
see
why
not
since
it
already
has
vanilla
in
it
high
five
to
the
brewery
will
definitely
have
again
worth
seeking
out
4

a
good
tasting
stout
which
leaves
behind

feeling
in

chocolate
with

o
i
got
this
beer
on
a
trip
to
vermont
given
my
expectations
the
heavens
would
part
etc
this
one
did
not
disappoint
the
aroma
is
off
the
charts
good
gorgeous
mix
of
coffee
and
chocolate
as
the
beer
warms
the
bitter
coffee
subsides
a
bit
and
gives
way
to
more
of
a
smooth
chocolate
the
tang
of
carbonation
seems
a
little
high
it
distracts
from
the
sensory
experience
and
hurts
the
overall
rating
this
tastes
similar
to
samuel
smiths
chocolate
stout
which
is
a
favorite
for
me
old
ba
score

i
really
wish
i
had
better
access
to
this
brewery
some
really
delicious
stuff
being
put
out
by
them

a
near

black
with
a
touch
of
deep
ruby
a
good
2
finger
head
with
a
creamy
brown
tint
the
first
smell
was
a
bit
disappointing
though
you
can
pick
up
bits
of
vanilla
coffee
and
bitter
earthy
tones
the
first
sip
more
than
made
up
for
the
smell
with
a
burst
of
chocolate
notes
followed
by
red
fruits
vanilla
a
touch
of
booze
and
a
clean
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
incredible
on
this
beer
it
felt
expansive
and
complex
without
being
too
thick
overall
i
was
really
impressed
this
and
péché
mortel
are
among
my
favorite
stouts
now
oi
enjoyed
this
one
a
bunch
and
the
sample
has
prompted
me
to
grab
a
bottle
in
the
near
future
overall
a
beer
to
seek
out
the
complex
flavor
makes
this
a
unique
stout
its
full
of
flavor
and
very
distinct
a
great
beer
to
dip
savor
and
enjoy
overall
a
good
stout
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
o
3

looks
and
smells
great
but
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
taste
and
mouth
feel
are
lacking
definitely
prefer
peche
mortel
o
a
very
good
beer
that
i
will
definitely
purchase
again
its
too
bad
that
this
is
not
a
regularly
listed
item
at
the
lcbo
it
really
should
be
o
great
stout
and
a
nice
surprise
as
i
picked
this
one
up
because
my
local
binnys
had
them
at
a
sweet
sale
price
i
would
reccommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
delicious
chocolate
tasting
brew
i
may
have
to
go
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
for
myself
dark
brown
to
black
colour
with
a
creamy
coffee
head
showing
quite
strong

some

cleaner
note
as
well
taste
is
bittersweet
with
lots
of
chocolate
mixed
with
vanilla
and
lemon
licorice
fairly
nice
actually
the
vanilla
didnt
steal
the
show
it
was
a
bit
sweet
but
still
refreshing
body
was
moderate
smooth
carbonation
with
a
dry
noticeably
vanilla
finish
i
was
worried
this
would
be
too
muc
a
dessert
beer
and
tho
it
certainly
leans
that
way
it
also
has
the
balance
and
complexity
to
be
a
nice
solid
stout
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
very
interesting
mix
of
complex
flavours
another
winner
from
this
outstanding
brewery
well
constructed
with
a
nice
bittersweet
combo
prost
lampertland
o
this
is
a
good
beer
its
a
bit
unbalanced
and
abrasively
bitter
the
vanilla
was
a
bit
subtle
and
i
though
it
could
use
more
heft
in
the
mouth
still
its
amazingly
dry
and
roasty
this
gives
the
chocolate
some
room
to
dance
tastes
darker
than
90
cacao
which
is
awesome
beautiful
brew
here
from
du
ciel
expert
use
of
vanilla
and
cocoa
nibs
in
this
stout
rich
yet
drinkable
never
cloying
and
as
authentic
as
it
comes
as
far
as
the
additives
are
concerned
the
nose
on
it
is
amazing
fresh
vanilla
beans
seeds
scraped
clean
from
the
pod
and
bitter
roasted
barley
and
dark
chocolate
malt
the
flavor
is
the
same
but
the
layers
impress
me
most
coffee
is
subtle
not
even
in
the
beer
but
i
taste
it
the
cocoa
is
earthy
and
bittersweet
but
it
comes
first
than
the
vanilla
as
it
moves
toward
the
finish
but
at
the
end
it
tastes
like
stout
rich
well
made
creamy
delicious
stout
the
additives
are
not
dominant
but
complimentary
a
fine
balance
the
feel
is
great
too
velvety
smooth
and
luscious
on
the
palate
coating
but
not
sugary
or
heavy
not
a
ton
of
carbonation
but
it
doesnt
need
more
than
what
it
has
an
excellent
beer
worthy
of
the
highest
praise
another
thing
i
love
about
this
and
all
of
their
beer
really
is
how
affordable
it
is
five
or
six
bucks
a
bottle
for
beer
of
this
quality
is
incredibly
fair
so
many
other
breweries
would
brutally
overcharge
for
beer
this
good
well
done
all
around
o
really
pleasant
this
followed
up
a
bottle
of
peche
mortel
tonight
and
while
this
doesnt
have
the
horsepower
of
peche
and
is
much
much
sweeter
its
also
really
enjoyable
overall
this
was
an
extremely
easy
drinking
stout
tasty
and
delicious
might
have
to
take
a
road
trip
to
quebec
in
the
near
future
bottle
labeled
aphrodite
unsure
on
the
bottle
date
missing
body
brings
this
down
a
notch
more
of
a
black
ale
other
than
that
it
is
an
easy
drinker
straight
forward
roast
and
bitter
as
you
may
like
o
a
beer
this
big
in
a
body
this
small
is
intriguing
thankfully
it
turned
out
delicious
hopefully
i
can
get
it
fresh
sometime
soon
its
the
roasty
cocoa
smell
that
really
set
this
one
up
for
me
great
example
of
a
creative
stout
and
the
vanilla
is
just
a
hint
which
is
just
fine
with
me
my
only
wishes
are
that
this
would
have
a
bit
more
weight
to
the
mouthfeel
and
a
lower
carbonic
bite
i
was
told
before
drinking
this
beer
that
the
vanilla
would
be
just
a
hint
and
it
wouldnt
be
overpowering
or
much
of
a
dessert
beer
as
it
was
i
think
she
was
right
that
it
isnt
overpowering
but
it
also
was
really
pleasant
in
the
vanilla
aspect
theres
the
roasted
malt
note
a
bit
of
sweet
chocolate
and
a
nice
level
of
vanilla
that
ends
it
out
and
is
so
tasty
a
twinge
of
hop
bitterness
is
found
on
the
very
finish
not
a
dessert
beer
i
wouldnt
say
but
just
an
awesome
beer
all
around
and
thats
coming
from
somebody
who
doesnt
list
stouts
among
his
favorite
styles
overall
a
world
class
stout
so
well
balanced
and
drinkable
highly
recommended
o
a
pretty
decent
beer
nothing
astounding
but
pretty
good
i
could
pick
up
a
six
pack
if
the
price
was
good
bottle
from
proof
pours
the
darkest
of
browns
around
the
edge
and
black
anywhere
further
than
a
millimeter
from
the
edge
slight
medium
brown
head
that
almost
immediately
faded
poor
legs
and
lacing
aroma
is
first
the
vanilla
and
deep
malt
then
a
twinge
of
coffee
then
some
sweet
oaky
bourbon
and
some
dark
chocolate
taste
is
the
chocolate
and
coffee
up
front
vanilla
in
the
midpalate
and
vanillawood
in
the
aftertaste
nice
low
carbonation
and
silky
mouthfeel
id
love
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
peche
mortel
a
truly
chocolate
feast
as
bold
and
deep
as
it
can
be
in
flavors
without
appealing
to
hop
marines
overall
very
good
beer
that
shouldnt
be
a
disappointment
for
stout
lovers
definitely
worth
a
try
and
certainly
a
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
a
winner
when
it
comes
to
lower
gravity
stouts
o
incredible
depth
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
for
a
6
5
beer
and
its
truly
delicious
to
boot
overall
good
stuff
but
i
was
expecting
more
flavors
and
aromas
are
balanced
but
seem
a
little
muted
as
well
the
cocoa
aspects
of
this
beer
are
very
strong
and
felt
in
diverse
ways
throughout
o
a
very
special
beer
from
a
bottle
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
small
khaki
colored
head
big
spicy
earthy
coffee
aroma
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
roast
in
the
background
sweet
roast
and
molasses
up
front
fade
into
earthy
coffee
and
lingering
coffee
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
without
much
carbonation
to
save
it
seems
to
fall
a
little
flat
flavors
are
there
but
not
as
impressed
as
i
was
hoping
pretty
easy
drinking
overall
obetter
than
the
peche
mortel
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
worked
well
together
just
a
tad
more
vanilla
would
have
made
this
phenomenal
o
not
your
average
dessert
beer
the
roasted
malt
flavors
get
bitter
acrid
and
astringent
much
like
a
good
irish
dry
stout
this
balances
any
cocoa
and
vanilla
sweetness
tit
for
tat
all
aspects
of
the
beer
work
together
harmoniously
and
it
stays
very
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
and
texture
are
brilliant
and
go
a
long
way
to
promote
drinkability
pretty
straightforward
pairing
with
chocolate
cake
worked
very
well
with
dark
chocolate
covered
almonds
overall
a
disappointing
beer
for
me
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
one
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
resulting
in
a
gently
foamy
smooth
mouthfeel
that
fits
the
beer
and
its
flavors
quite
well
closes
dry
with
medium
levels
of
stickiness
clinging
to
the
lips
and
palate
ogreat
stoutvery
enjoyable
after
dinner
or
with
dessert
poured
into
a
16
oz
snifter
pours
pitch
black
with
a
one
inch
dark
tan
head
that
leaves
behind
beautiful
lace
smell
is
toffee
vanilla
butterscotch
coffee
and
cocoa
taste
is
all
of
that
the
most
dominant
is
butterscotch
and
vanilla
body
is
maybe
medium
just
the
right
carbonation
a
touch
dry
and
goes
down
easy
this
is
very
nice
seems
bigger
than
its
abv
nice
stout
a
bit
expensive
o
not
a
terrible
beer
but
also
not
a
great
one
i
wouldnt
have
another
based
on
this
though
i
suppose
this
may
not
be
the
best
representation
drinkability
this
is
one
ill
definitely
buy
again
and
recommend
to
friends
however
its
a
toss
up
between
this
one
and
peche
mortel
i
think
id
go
for
peche
mortel
first
before
i
picked
this
one
up
again
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
great
beer
but
peche
mortel
is
a
bit
more
complex
and
i
feel
its
just
crafted
better
i
love
this
beer
and
id
really
like
to
see
a
brew
come
from
them
that
combines
the
elements
of
this
beer
with
peche
mortelthat
would
be
quite
the
beer
o
pretty
powerful
stuff
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
wakemeup
juice
i
could
do
with
a
lot
more
of
the
vanilla
to
tone
down
the
java
bean
flavors
i
cant
say
i
dislike
it
but
at
the
same
time
im
not
blown
away
still
good
though
this
is
one
of
the
best
chocolatevanilla
adjunct
stouts
ive
had
the
first
time
i
had
it
was
at
the
trappist
on
taptwo
years
ago
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
have
it
again
wont
pass
this
up
when
i
see
it
next
o
this
is
my
third
beer
from
dieu
du
ciel
and
they
have
all
been
fantastic
i
am
going
to
buy
every
beer
i
see
of
theirs
being
a
regular
stout
this
is
the
best
ive
had
absolutely
love
this
beer
o
hot
damn
this
is
one
beautiful
stout
even
though
there
was
no
actual
coffee
involved
in
the
brewing
the
coffee
notes
are
vibrant
and
gives
beers
like
fbs
wnb
and
ccb
cubano
espresso
a
run
for
their
money
overall
great
stout
with
an
added
hop
bite
full
flavored
and
unique
more
drinkable
than
most
stouts
and
that
isnt
a
bad
thing
the
only
downside
here
in
the
states
in
the
price
overall
very
good
not
great
a
very
good
combination
of
flavors
especially
with
the
vanilla
but
the
beer
could
definitely
use
more
body
again
enjoyable
but
not
on
the
level
of
peche
mortel
yet
another
solid
offering
from
dieu
du
ciel
this
appeals
to
me
by
not
packing
the
stout
with
loads
of
sweet
textures
and
instead
enhancing
the
aspects
of
chocolate
that
i
enjoy
best
roasted
bitter
fullbodied
and
most
importantly
very
tannic
and
juicy
overall
this
is
instead
rather
dry
and
really
gets
all
of
the
dark
barley
flavors
with
no
juiciness
to
speak
of
but
the
vanilla
is
a
nice
addition
that
makes
this
heartier
without
being
overwhelming
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
rich
so
its
a
conundrum
to
figure
out
how
fast
to
finish
awesome
stuff
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
but
as
opposed
to
my
friend
b
who
quite
enjoys
it
i
will
not
be
revisiting
it
any
time
soon
overall
a
very
nice
beer
though
the
price
of
this
one
will
likely
keep
me
from
revisiting
for
a
nonimperial
stout
it
has
good
flavor
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
o
if
you
want
a
vanilla
or
chocolate
forward
stout
look
no
further
this
one
is
very
good
while
maintaining
a
nice
balance
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
and
never
getting
overly
sweet
this
would
make
the
perfect
dessert
beer
o
nice
with
vanilla
increasing
on
warming
overall
this
is
a
nice
original
stout
but
not
my
favourite
though
tastes
more
like
a
dry
stout
i
prefer
the
mikkeller
beergeek
breakfast
by
far
i
precise
that
i
tried
it
both
for
apertizer
and
dessert
with
black
chocolate
cheers
not
as
robust
as
the
other
couple
stouts
ive
had
from
dieu
du
ciel
but
this
is
quite
nice
im
sure
glad
i
brought
a
6
pack
back
from
quebec
city
but
i
wont
be
hunting
down
any
more
o
very
drinkable
excellent
beer
overall
drank
between
fridge
temperature
and
room
temperature
this
stout
was
very
easy
to
drink
this
was
a
stout
with
balanced
flavours
with
none
overpowering
sessionable
for
a
strong
beer
overall
an
exceptional
stout
not
a
chocolate
or
vanilla
monster
but
very
well
balanced
sessionable
and
delicious
this
pours
a
thick
black
with
a
creamy
foam
topping
it
has
an
amazing
cocoa
smoothness
creamy
velvety
thick
rich
with
a
great
aroma
of
powdered
cocoa
dust
and
an
amazing
full
flavor
to
match
its
such
a
fantastic
belgostout
that
its
become
my
new
benchmark
for
the
style
just
fantastic
all
around
great
balance
of
roast
and
sweetness
chocolate
dominant
with
enough
coffee
and
vanilla
to
create
a
harmonious
flavor
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
retreats
slowly
the
beer
smells
of
deep
chocolate
and
vanilla
with
some
dark
roasted
malt
and
caramel
the
malt
comes
through
stronger
in
the
flavor
than
it
did
in
the
nose
with
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
blending
in
very
well
theres
some
coffee
flavors
that
come
through
in
there
too
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
theres
a
nice
roasty
aftertaste
in
the
finish
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
an
excellent
beer
this
is
a
solid
stout
but
there
is
certainly
nothing
extraordinary
here
i
got
no
hint
of
the
vanilla
beans
mentioned
as
ingredients
on
the
label
in
sum
there
are
better
single
stouts
on
the
market
that
are
also
cheaper
overall
a
disappointment
given
ratings
here
not
up
to
par
due
to
disintegrated
nature
high
b
verdict
a
nice
stout
from
dieu
du
ciel
the
vanilla
is
really
the
star
player
here
and
while
it
comes
off
a
bit
artificial
the
other
supporting
elements
do
enough
to
provide
a
bit
of
balance
this
is
certainly
a
great
choice
for
desert
or
for
anyone
who
has
a
sweet
tooth
o
a
very
good
sweet
stout
if
a
little
high
on
alcohol
at
6
5
more
balanced
than
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
this
category
one
damn
tasty
american
stout
i
wish
it
had
more
dusty
cocoa
to
match
up
to
the
vanilla
but
the
added
roasted
coffee
implication
from
the
malts
was
bonus
recommended
and
recommended
for
myself
to
have
again
d
a
damn
good
stout
by
ddc
full
of
flavor
and
extremely
drinkable
given
the
abv
and
flavor
here
this
one
is
just
too
good
to
pass
up
at
6
50
abv
this
punches
above
its
weight
this
certainly
wont
be
my
last
dance
with
aphrodisiaque
thats
for
sure
o
good
stout
if
youre
not
paying
for
it
its
simple
and
delivers
on
flavor
pours
a
very
deep
dark
brown
topped
with
a
fluffy

light
beige
head
excellent
retention
no

cocoa
fresh
vanilla
and
roasted

on
the
nose
both
dark
and
milk
chocolate
intially
joined
by
rich
vanilla
and
a
considerable
amount
of
roasted
malt
finishes
with
considerable
roastiness
and
hints
of
espresso
combined
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
mediumbodied
smooth
and
creamy
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
that
highlights
a
heavy
chocolate
and
vanilla
presence
without
becoming
overly
sweet
exceptionally
wellbalanced
recommended
o
tastes
as
advertised
with
lots
of
strong
flavors
for
an
otherwise
completly
light
stout
easy
to
drink
dispite
the
heavy
dessert
flavors
impressive
stuff
for
a
standard
stout
definitely
worth
a
try
but
twilight
of
the
idols
was
better
taste
and
it
was
a
porter
o
a
sweet
and
chocolatey
stout
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
samuel
smiths
organic
chocolate
stout
theres
that
burnt
marshmallow
and
chocolate
that
pervades
everything
this
is
a
little
bigger
version
i
think
with
a
little
better
balance
great
dessert
beer
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
fan
of
dark
beer
very
very
nice
cost
5
for
a
12
oz
bottle
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
solid
brew
certainly
a
nice
touch
to
an
american
stout
mouthfeel
was
a
little
off
but
the
taste
was
very
good
my
favorite
stouts
are
heavier
and
thicker
than
this
one
abv
of
6
5
but
given
the
paramters
i
like
it
pretty
well
its
not
as
sweet
as
a
lot
of
other
dark
stouts
and
it
has
a
medium
body
rather
than
a
heavy
body
yet
its
still
very
full
flavored
nice
balancing
bitterness
rare
to
find
in
ontario
so
this
was
just
imported
from
halifax
last
week
will
jump
at
any
future
chances
to
buy
pours
a
solid
black
color
with
a
good
sized
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
cap
on
top
smells
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
up
front
with
hints
of
caramel
coffee
and
roasted
grain
smells
like
a
sweet
stout
with
vanilla
added
the
flavor
is
very
chocolatey
with
a
vanilla
edge
just
like
the
nose
promised
theres
a
lactose
type
sweetness
along
with
some
earthy
hops
and
a
lingering
sweet
roasty
finish
medium
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
light
syrupy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
flavorful
sweet

i
really
enjoyed
this

aroma
surprising
body
for
the
abv
a
light
coffee
cocoa
and
strong
roasty
malt
start
with
a
quick
drop
off
in
flavor
to
a
light
malt
english
style
stout
finish
interesting
progression
and
the
start
is
very
nice
worth
picking
up
on
the
rare
occasions
it
is
available
the
appearance
is
black
with
short
tan
head
atop
the
nose
contains
vanilla
dark
chocolate
some
roasted
malts
sipping
on
this
beauty
and
i
taste
coffee
more
vanilla
and
chocolate
dman
this
beer
tastes
good
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
velvet
texture
overall
a
very
good
beer
that
i
waited
too
long
too
try
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
ive
been
a
little
underwhelmed
with
this
brewery
in
the
past
but
they
certainly
dont
disappoint
here
ill
definitely
be
picking
this
one
up
again
i
actually
think
i
like
it
better
than
the
peche
mortel
overall
a
very
flavorful
stout
that
is
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
checking
out
as
a
different
take
on
the
flavored
stout
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
beer
a
fine
example
of
a
chocolate
stout
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
true
pint
the
beer
is
a
browntoblack
coloring
with
a
thick
dark
chocolate
milk
colored
head
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
abound
with
some
milk
chocolate
blending
flavors
flavors
are
sweet
and
smooth
with
a
roasty
backbone
vanilla
and
cream
sweetness
counteract
the
bitter
chocolate
presence
creamy
and
bitter
aftertaste
blends
nicely
with
the
palate
smooth
rich
finish
this
is
a
strong
tasty
brew
t
lots
of
roasted
malt
and
vanilla
upfront
chocolate
is
there
but
much
darker
than
the
aroma
suggests
some
charred
wood
and
a
touch
of
rye
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
definitely
a
bit
thin
but
for
a
stout
this
low
in
abv
this
is
very
complex
and
awesome
for
me
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
lacking
it
was
on
the
thinner
side
of
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
and
light
creaminess
but
it
felt
insubstantial
for
the
flavors
it
packs
i
know
its
not
an
imperial
stout
and
shouldnt
have
that
hefty
a
body
but
it
seemed
a
little
thin
overall
not
bad
certainly
well
made
but
not
something
id
go
too
nuts
over
tracking
down
again
o
the
stunning
scent
and
flavour
easily
stand
up
as
a
dessert
on
its
own
although
not
overly
sweet
the
notes
of
coco
and
vanilla
develop
a
delightfully
deep
and
robust
brew
id
love
to
try
this
again
with
triamisu
my
only
wish
is
that
it
had
a
heavier
creamier
mouthfeel
o
a
unique
beer
that
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
flavors
of
roasted
cocoa
and
vanilla
o
very
drinkable
and
tasty
definitely
one
of
canadas
top
beers
overall
what
a
fantastic
brew
worth
every
penny
and
then
some
o
the
stouts
i
drink
these
days
are
about
10
abv
on
average
when
i
occasionally
try
something
around
5
i
am
generally
unhappy
with
the
amount
of
flavor
while
this
beers
taste
fades
a
bit
and
is
not
as
big
as
a
black
tuesday
or
dark
lord
it
has
a
great
deal
of
flavor
for
6
5
on
the
sweeter
side
of
stouts
thanks
to
the
vanilla
beans
which
is
just
fine
by
me
it
could
be
more
complex
but
it
still
may
be
my
favorite
nonimperial
or
double
stout
pours
pitch
black
with
minimal
head
something
about
that
makes
me
think
this
is
going
to
be
delicious
smells
lightly
of
roasted
malts
and
vanilla
i
actually
thought
the
nose
would
be
more
prominent
the
first
sip
yields
a
beautiful
mixture
roasted
malts
chocolate
vanilla
and
bit
of
spices
low
carbonation
and
very
smooth
this
is
a
very
flavorful
stout
id
definitely
recommend
it
this
is
a
fantastic
flavored
stout
sweet
but
well
balanced
with
bitterness
very
delicious
swing
and
a
miss
for
ddc
note
to
self
ranked
6
beer
in
canada
and
4
american
stout
when
i
reviewed
it
o
i
like
that
ddc
was
restrained
on
the
body
and
the
sweetness
this
beer
showcases
true
cocoa
and
vanilla
not
some
overly
sweet
milk
chocolate
bar
i
really
liked
that
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
this
out
o
the
beer
is
very
enjoyable
especially
since
it
has
the
tastes
of
the
cocoa
and
vanilla
but
is
not
sweet
it
paired
greatly
with
the
dessert
when
it
was
served
i
wish
that
the
body
was
just
a
hint
fuller
but
this
is
still
a
really
great
beer
definitely
one
i
would
get
again
cheers
o
a
great
drinker
with
sweet
and
roasty
notes
great
chocolate
presence
with
subtle
but
identifiable
vanilla
as
well
recommended
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
by
dieu
du
ciel
has
a
good
balance
of
sweet
vanilla
and
bitter
chocolate
flavours
very
lovely
appearance
and
smoothness
definitely
worth
a
try
definitely
let
this
one
warm
up
in
a
pint
glass
to
get
the
full
experience
this
is
a
great
beer
for
relaxing
conversation
the
development
that
comes
with
warmth
allows
one
to
consume
it
slowly
in
a
long
mellow
session
o
worthy
tasty
credible
absolutely
enjoyable
though
perhaps
a
yard
short
of
astounding
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
drinkability
is
great
now
for
another
sip
wait
the
bottle
is
empty
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
thick
beige
head
big
blast
of
vanilla
chocolate
smells
like
a
sweet
hot
chocolate
a
lactic
presence
in
there
as
well
very
nice
flavor
with
prominent
vanilla
throughout
like
drinking
milky
hot
chocolate
i
would
like
more
roast
presence
medium
bodied
with
lingering
sweetness
overall
tasty
beer
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
im
going
to
try
get
a
fresh
bottle
via
trade
soon
rereview
then
as
i
dont
think
this
review
does
justice
to
the
brew
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
founders
tulip
beer
pours
a
jet
black
shade
with
an
extremely
thin
layer
of
what
can
best
be
simply
described
as
a
layer
of
carbonation
whatever
it
is
it
definitely
does
not
constitute
a
head
or
a
crown
the
layer
is
very
bubbly
effervescent
and
fleeting
this
beer
has
absolutely
no
legs
whatsoever
it
doesnt
cling
to
the
glass
even
a
little
the
nose
is
very
disappointing
there
almost
isnt
one
the
bottles
label
mentions
cocoa
and
vanilla
beans
i
dont
detect
either
just
some
faded
coffee
the
taste
is
marginally
better
than
the
nose
in
that
i
can
actually
get
a
grasp
of
the
coffee
element
its
not
bold
by
any
means
but
its
there
not
a
lot
else
going
on
the
mouthfeel
simply
isnt
what
id
expect
from
this
its
thin
and
despite
the
visual
lack
of
carbonation
on
the
pour
manages
to
give
off
a
very
tingly
feel
on
second
thought
its
just
astringent
this
doesnt
coat
the
mouth
and
just
leaves
bitterness
behind
ive
got
a
feeling
this
is
an
older
bottle
i
wonder
what
itd
have
been
like
fresh
i
truly
believe
coffee
beers
are
best
enjoyed
fresh
despite
everyones
insatiable
desire
to
cellar
everything
called
a
stout
d
the
underlying
beer
is
obviously
fairly
complex
but
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
completely
dominate
this
is
a
perfect
desert
beer
and
despite
its
sweetness
it
doesnt
become
cloying
like
so
many
other
chocolate
stouts
do
poured
from
a
341ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
creamy
head
strong
smell
of
cacao
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
at
first
the
taste
reminds
me
the
bitterness
of
the
cacao
then
sweet
notes
of
malt
appear
with
a
vanilla
finish
that
complete
perfectly
the
blend
mouthfeel
is
excellent
but
i
would
have
appreciated
a
thicker
body
overall
this
beer
is
absolutely
amazing
very
easy
to
drink
and
perfectly
balanced
what
a
success
overall
this
was
a
great
bottle
my
fiance
picked
out
on
our
trip
to
chicago
i
wish
that
this
was
available
to
me
down
here
because
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
for
sure
great
aroma
and
taste
and
easy
to
drink
on
top
of
that
the
6
5
is
a
nice
touch
as
you
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
o
i
really
liked
this
one
a
lot
i
really
like
the
natural
vanilla
smells
and
flavors
i
am
constantly
impressed
with
dieu
du
ciels
stouts
o
overall
i
actually
like
and
prefer
this
over
peche
but
the
body
could
be
just
a
little
heavier
and
this
would
be
great
o
a
very
good
stout
do
not
expect
something
explosive
or
aggressive
here
this
is
all
in
sweetness
and
faint
subtle
touches
o
its
just
an
ok
coffee
stout
without
any
vanilla
flavor
sad
that
they
advertise
something
one
cant
taste
good
beer
would
rate
higher
but
must
deduct
due
to
lack
of
vanilla
flavor
this
is
a
great
stout
with
tons
of
flavors
without
diverting
from
the
tradition
of
the
style
o
very
enjoyable
creamy
stout
with
abv
well
hidden
i
would
highly
recommend
it
o
insanely
drinkable
once
you
start
you
just
cant
put
it
down
o
a
very
good
dessert
brew
i
would
recommend
trying
but
too
expensive
for
all
the
time
overall
a
delicious
stout
with
great
complexity
this
is
not
a
very
carbonated
beer
it
has
a
full
mouthfeel
and
the
chocolate
flavor
continues
down
to
the
last
sip
very
good
beer
to
have
for
dessert
especially
with
a
chocolate
and
caramel
dessert
it
has
enough
flavor
to
stand
up
to
a
really
sweet
dessert
i
loved
it
this
is
a
dessert
that
stands
by
itself
i
would
have
another
maybe
with
a
pastry
or
cheesecake
d
awesome
drink
i
really
liked
this
stout
sweet
while
carrying
a
heavy
roasted
malt
taste
highly
recommended
and
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
very
drinkable
and
if
i
had
this
available
in
6
packs
there
is
certainly
occasions
that
would
call
for
it
d
very
drinkable
i
really
like
the
big
chocolate
and
vanilla
flavors
and
they
taste
great
together
throughout
the
beer
the
lingering
sweetness
is
really
nice
o
while
i
thought
the
nose
and
the
taste
were
pretty
decent
the
mouthfeel
killed
it
it
was
super
thin
and
it
felt
watered
down
paid
a
bunch
of
pretty
pennies
for
this
one
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
is
a
one
and
done
o
good
solid
stout
and
full
of
flavor
drink
near
room
temperature
cold
can
take
alot
out
of
the
flavor
of
this
beer
great
after
dinner
beer
when
i
poured
and
put
my
nose
to
this
thing
i
got
pretty
excited
the
smell
is
such
a
beautiful
crushed
vanilla
bean
and
cocoa
worked
into
a
marshmellow
then
roasted
to
a
perfect
golden
brown
it
smells
so
delicious
and
well
balanced
you
still
get
a
little
of
all
of
that
but
it
very
much
skirts
around
the
edges
of
what
is
mostly
a
roasted
malt
center
this
beer
dreams
and
teases
of
being
smooth
and
sweet
but
instead
its
a
little
coarse
and
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
and
prickly
its
one
of
the
almosts
that
you
have
to
give
its
due
but
its
hard
not
to
drink
with
a
sense
of
wishing
o
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
but
overall
im
disappointed
pours
a
very
dark
coffee
brown
with
a
greyish
dark
brown
head
which
dissipates
rather
quickly
to
a
ring
not
much
lacing
smells
like
nicely
melded
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
a
soupcon
of
vanilla
and
some
roastiness
taste
is
weak
vanilla
on
the
forefront
and
some
cola
and
cocoa
nibs
kind
of
thin
in
a
way
that
really
detracts
from
my
enjoyment
medium
carbonation
which
has
a
colalike
synthetic
feel
and
the
thin
mouthfeel
is
really
lacking
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
from
an
otherwise
great
brewery
i
would
pass
in
the
future
overall
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
ever
had
very
well
balance
with
distinct
chocolate
and
vanilla
flavors
a
masterpiece
overall
this
is
the
second
stout
for
me
from
brasserie
du
ciel
and
theyve
hit
it
out
of
the
park
both
times
its
probably
good
that
this
ones
kind
of
hard
to
obtain
in
indy
id
probably
be
tempted
to
drink
it
to
the
point
of
getting
burnt
out
nothing
but
great
things
to
say
highlyrecommended
and
for
the
record
great
beers
can
come
in
bottles
w
twistoff
caps
o
like
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
is
severely
lacking
looking
for
a
little
creaminess
out
of
this
but
none
to
be
found
still
a
decent
stout
allinall
overall
this
is
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
from
the
first
time
i
had
it
on
tap
i
question
the
freshnessvariability
from
tap
to
bottle
but
anyway
this
is
still
a
worldclass
beer
that
packs
so
much
flavors
for
only
6
5
alcohol
i
would
gladly
have
this
over
many
higher
rated
imp
stouts
for
the
balance
and
drinkability
92
my
first
impression
on
dieu
de
ciel
is
fairly
good
and
i
think
ill
be
back
for
some
other
offerings
rather
soon
im
surprised
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
one
of
their
beers
o
the
heat
that
still
somehow
remains
on
this
keeps
it
from
top
marks
i
will
have
to
rereview
this
with
a
fresher
sample
because
as
it
is
this
is
extremely
tasty
and
minus
the
alcohol
heat
would
be
very
drinkable
pours
black
inky
and
viscous
smells
super
chocolatey
and
with
a
fair
bit
of
vanilla
foxs
ubet
syrup
with
some
dark
cacao
added
the
taste
is
similar
with
the
dark
cacao
evident
especially
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
silky
but
the
flavor
while
good
seems
slightly
thin
a
bit
more
oomph
in
the
flavor
department
would
make
this
beer
excellent
as
it
stands
its
a
fine
beer
but
one
of
the
more
genteel
chocolate
beers
around
the
vanilla
notes
however
are
very
nice
without
being
overbearing
worth
trying
for
sure
o
i
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
after
trying
peche
mortelwhich
i
love
this
one
shouldnt
play
second
fiddle
to
it
either
it
is
a
solid
stout
in
every
sense
of
the
word
not
overley
sweet
and
very
well
balanced
and
blended
the
more
beers
i
try
by
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
the
more
im
liking
what
they
do
well
done
o
very
similar
to
how
i
remember
it
on
tap
though
the
flavor
seems
just
a
touch
less
impressive
still
its
easily
one
of
the
best
regularstouts
ive
had
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
a
little
bit
better
with
some
warmth
but
the
body
is
a
thin
overall
i
dont
get
many
more
dimensions
other
than
the
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
roast
solid
beer
a
little
underwhelming
for
the
price
overall
a
mustdrink
for
stout
or
chocolate
lovers
it
made
its
way
into
my
favorite
stout
leaving
the
youngs
double
chocolate
and
rogue
chocolate
stout
far
behind
ill
try
to
find
more
unfiltered
beers
from
now
on
o
definitely
a
solid
beer
i
did
not
find
it
as
sweet
as
some
have
mentioned
if
this
beer
does
have
a
fault
its
that
its
a
bit
too
sweet
tasting
like
a
good
stout
has
been
poured
over
rich
vanilla
bean
ice
cream
if
thats
your
poison
then
give
this
one
a
try
if
youre
more
into
bitter
hops
and
burnt
flavors
you
might
want
to
go
for
something
a
bit
heavier
nearly
pitch
black
tan
head
with
traces
of
white
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
vanilla
bean
rated
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
not
to
sweet
with
some
bittersweet
notes
very
nice
to
smell
this
one
taste
is
smoky
vanilla
followed
by
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
coffee
and
more
vanilla
in
the
finish
lightly
sweet
but
very
well
balanced
thin
to
medium
body
light
carbonation
cream
and
milky
as
well
excellent
stuff
super
easy
drinking
and
very
complex
while
still
very
approachable
o
loved
this
beer
the
balance
between
the
cocoa
and
the
vanilla
just
outstanding
relatively
thin
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
but
not
detracting
overall
an
excellent
brew
with
this
and
peche
mortel
in
the
lineup
this
brewery
obviously
knows
how
to
make
a
superb
stout
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
drinking
this
is
the
more
refined
felix
to
the
bolder
oscar
that
is
southern
tier
choklat
forget
just
desserts
i
could
drink
this
almost
anytime
overall
what
a
stout
i
really
liked
this
beer
because
it
has
a
bold
flavor
profile
that
is
balanced
to
perfection
i
really
want
to
sit
down
and
drink
2
or
3
bottles
of
this
beer
at
a
time
and
at
6
5
you
can
without
gettng
hammered
this
canadian
brewery
really
brings
some
serious
delicous
dark
beers
into
the
craft
beer
scene
bravo
must
try
for
any
stout
lover
this
was
a
very
nice
second
stout
choice
after
peche
de
mortal
poured
a
really
dark
brown
could
have
been
black
mocha
colored
head
lasted
a
bit
some
lacing
on
glass
smelled
of
vanilla
lots
of
vanilla
tasted
sweeter
rather
than
bittersweet
vanilla
and
coffee
are
prominent
drier
mouthfeel
than
expected
overall
another
solid
beer
from
the
little
brewery
in
montreal
this
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
thats
damn
near
black
a
tan
colored
head
sits
briefly
before
returning
back
into
the
glass
there
is
minimal
lacing
but
some
oily
walls
are
left
behind
the
nose
is
wonderful
some
very
prominent
vanilla
and
cocoa
notes
are
spilling
out
with
boldness
very
sweet
and
inviting
to
say
the
least
the
taste
amplifies
the
nose
by
far
a
bitter
chocolate
hits
and
settles
to
a
sweeter
milkier
taste
there
is
a
good
amount
of
vanilla
blended
in
that
isnt
cloying
or
overpowering
also
a
bit
of
coffee
stands
out
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
i
wanted
but
at
the
same
time
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
good
stuff
for
sure
many
thanks
to
beenitty
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
one
my
second
offering
from
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
the
first
being
peche
mortel
poured
into
my
dfh
snifter
pours
a
pitch
black
syrupy
texture
solid
tan
head
on
top
very
nice
retention
smell
molasses
dark
chocolate
vanilla
maybe
some
woodiness
taste
definetely
dark
chocolate
first
with
nice
roasty
bitterness
this
mouthfeel
is
super
chewy
and
thick
love
it
for
the
style
what
doesnt
play
through
here
is
the
coffee
but
it
may
be
because
this
bottle
has
some
time
on
it
overall
an
impressive
stout
id
have
it
again
for
sure
d
definitely
drinkable
and
will
be
picking
this
up
again
great
naturaltasting
roasted
flavours
without
being
too
over
the
top
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
nearly
black
the
head
was
about
a
half
inch
thick
and
laced
pretty
well
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
strong
roasted
aroma
with
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
on
the
sweeter
side
its
got
good
flavors
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
the
aftertaste
is
semisweet
and
had
a
toasted
bitter
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
about
medium
bodied
and
felt
pretty
slick
overall
it
was
a
good
stout
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
body
is
substantial
a
wonderful
beer
and
a
very
welcome
gift
from
my
friends
in
montreal
wow
i
love
it
im
a
big
fan
of
vanilla
in
beer
and
this
is
certainly
no
exception
as
a
stout
goes
this
is
exemplary
well
balanced
and
well
made
overalla
wonderful
beer
i
could
not
get
enough
of
this
an
excellent
drink
and
a
great
representation
of
a
vanilla
stout
seek
this
out
overall
pretty
interesting
but
i
was
thinking
more
vanilla
would
be
presented
but
it
didnt
come
out
its
still
a
great
stout
for
its
style
would
have
again
anytime
beer
is
medium
body
sweet
up
front
moderate
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
beer
the
midpalate
has
some
vanilla
and
more
sweetness
id
have
it
again
my
wife
loves
this
beer
overall
pretty
amazing
stout
from
a
pretty
amazing
brewery
i
wish
i
could
get
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
but
unfortunately
i
had
to
trade
for
it
and
i
only
got
one
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
and
wish
i
got
a
six
pack
of
it
the
smells
are
great
and
just
what
a
stout
should
be
and
the
tastes
follow
up
just
as
amazing
with
a
fantastic
roasted
malt
smokiness
that
just
does
not
quit
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
stout
and
i
would
definitely
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
if
i
could
one
of
the
nicer
stouts
that
i
have
had
definitely
one
of
the
nicer
stouts
that
i
have
had
that
has
flavor
additives
superior
to

very
nice
drinkability
its
a
great
beer
accompanined
with
great
flavours
and
aromas
great
dessert
beer
overall
not
bad
as
crazy
as
it
sounds
this
would
pair
extremely
well
with
anything
vanilla
i
would
like
to
give
it
a
shot
with
some
vanilla
ice
cream
on
the
side
o
this
is
one
awesome
beer
for
sure
very
drinkable
great
tasting
one
thing
ive
noted
is
that
it
feels
almost
a
bit
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
o
very
drinkable
a
definite
dessert
type
treat
delicious
this
beer
is
a
special
treat
the
cpj
o
surprisingly
nice
small
stout
a
benchmark
vanilla
bean
stout
d
not
too
bad
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
one
if
i
encounter
again
it
was
called
aphrodite
not
aphrodisiac
o
good
drinkable
stout
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
the
vanilla
beans
d
was
expecting
to
like
this
beer
a
lot
more
flavors
need
to
be
stronger
for
my
tastes
a
good
stout
i
dig
it
not
to
many
stouts
in
this
price
range
utilize
vanilla
beans
or
let
them
shine
this
much
worth
the
buy
to
experiance
probally
one
of
the
most
flavorfull
standard
stouts
ive
ever
had
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
small
1
inch
khaki
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
tiny
cap
decent
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
dark
roasted
malt
dark
cocoa
powder
and
vanilla
beans
taste
is
of
rich
chocolate
syrup
roasted
malts
and
vanilla
beans
the
tastes
are
very
balanced
and
overall
this
beer
is
not
sweet
at
all
there
is
a
dark
chocolate
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
making
for
a
thin
and
light
presence
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
with
nice
cocoa
and
vanilla
flavors
that
shows
that
a
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
sweet
to
have
these
flavors
on
display
overall
pretty
decent
beer
taste
is
not
bad
at
all
the
bottle
says
brewed
with
cocoa
and
vanilla
and
that
is
pretty
much
what
you
get
i
have
had
some
better
american
stouts
that
being
said
its
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
just
enough
carbonation
finish
is
surprisingly
dry
given
the
sweet
flavor
this
is
an
excellent
chocolate
stout
will
be
buying
again
this
is
really
delicious
ive
come
to
expect
super
high
quality
from
this
brewery
the
beer
must
be
enjoyed
quite
warm
however
and
it
is
entirely
too
cold
with
too
much
of
a
booze
taste
directly
from
the
tap
o
pretty
tasty
and
unique
wasnt
too
into
it
at
first
but
the
more
it
warmed
i
felt
the
flavors
worked
together
well
a
great
dessert
beer
and
im
sure
it
would
be
great
with
some
kind
of
chocolate
or
brownie
the
price
and
sweetness
would
limit
me
to
one
at
a
time
but
could
see
picking
this
up
from
time
to
time
for
a
chocolatey
treat
overall
all
the
good
stuff
a
stout
should
be
but
still
sets
itself
apart
from
the
rest
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
i
would
recommend
letting
it
warm
up
a
bit
before
drinking
it
really
shines
when
the
vanilla
comes
through
this
is
definitely
a
dessert
sort
of
brew
and
now
one
i
would
have
all
the
time
but
it
is
quite
enjoyable
great
taste
a
decent
bitter
hop
counterpart
i
wasnt
expecting
these
guys
cant
make
their
ipa
hoppy
but
then
the
stout
is
velvety
smooth
after
you
adjust
to
the
apt
bitterness
plenty
of
vanilla
feel
to
it
paired
with
sweetness
this
beer
gives
you
a
good
amount
of
everything
i
tend
to
hold
good
in
a
stout
and
never
seemed
boozy
only
downside
of
this
was
that
it
was
about
5
for
a
12oz
bottle
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
brown
head
in
the
aroma
dry
chocolate
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
vanilla
in
the
taste
cocoa
and
hints
of
vanilla
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
cocoa
aftertaste
big
chocolate
cocoa
presence
nice
hints
of
vanilla
a
bit
thin
but
nice
so
how
does
the
overall
score
exceed
the
average
of
the
other
four
well
since
ba
changed
the
name
of
the
fifth
element
i
think
they
should
have
called
it
leeloo
i
have
taken
it
to
mean
that
subjectivity
is
now
allowed
to
be
a
factor
although
this
did
not
warrant
a
4
5
across
all
the
technical
criteria
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
it
deserved
in
my
humble
estimation
because
of
the
low
alcohol
this
is
a
very
good
beer
to
drink
d
drinkability
is
moderately
high
the
nose
is
easily
the
best
part
of
this
beer
but
thats
not
to
discredit
the
flavor
rather
than
to
praise
the
aroma
i
think
if
the
taste
matched
the
nose
in
complexity
and
composition
this
would
be
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
but
as
it
is
now
i
think
fbs
and
wnb
are
overall
better
beers
at
a
cheaper
pricepoint
d
the
drinkability
was
excellent
as
this
wasnt
a
sweet
drink
but
mostly
the
dark
roast
almost
to
the
point
of
charring
of
the
coffee
is
the
star
of
this
show
it
does
imbue
a
decent
bitterness
to
this
beer
that
surely
doesnt
come
from
hops
though
in
spite
of
the
strong
bitterness
the
head
retention
helps
with
the
mouthfeels
extreme
creaminess
its
an
interesting
contradiction
in
both
flavor
and
mouthfeel
because
an
11
5
oz
bottle
cost
almost

drinkable
but
is
a
pretty
impressive
release
its
biggest
problem
is
that
it
doesnt
have
as
much
body
as
it
needs
it
needs
to
be
a
little
bigger
and
a
little
more
badass
to
truly
display
its
best
qualities
the
nose
would
also
benefit
from
more
strength
having
said
all
that
easy
to
drink
with
its
creamy
feel
and
rich
flavors
vanilla
and

pours
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
moderate
cocoa
colored
head
that
quicly
dissipates
leaving
a
nice
lacing
aroma
is
dominated
by
chocolate
with
mild
coffee
and
molasses
notes
taste
is
domonated
by
dark
chocolate
flavors
backed
up
by
vanilla
and
cocoa
flavors
finishes
moderately
sweet
with
a
medium
body
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
and
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
and
thats
the
only
criticism
i
have
of
this
beer
the
alcohol
never
rears
its
head
in
the
flavors
and
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
definitely
revisit
overall
slightly
disappointing
if
the
chemical
aspect
was
removed
the
sweetness
toned
down
and
cleaned
up
a
bit
i
could
see
it
being
a
good
but
not
great
beer
d
one
and
done
this
beer
is
tasty
but
not
something
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
night
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
and
sweet
flavors
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
make
it
too
much
like
a
dessert
beer
one
is
all
you
need
d
tasty
chocolatey
stout
with
a
wellrounded
flavor
plenty
of
bitterness
and
pleasant
vanilla
sweetness
not
as
amazing
as
peche
mortel
but
still
quite
good
great
drinkability
very
pleasant
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
dieu

d
this
is
the
first
beer
brewed
with

that
i
truly
enjoyed
well
blended
and
balanced
goes
down
easily
very
tasty
that
said
this
isnt
a
sessionable
beer
but
most
certainly
one
to
sit
and
enjoy
a
pint
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
great
flavor
profile
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
several
can
be
had
in
a
session
worth
seeking
this
one
out
d
this
kind
of
seems
like
a
novelty
beer
it
looks
and
smells
great
but
the
taste
is
kind
of
a
let
down
something
i
doubt
ill
pick
up
again
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
stiff
tan
colored
head
minimal
retention
but
decent
lacing
smell
is
of
dark
chocolate
vanilla
oak
roasted
grains
taste
follows
scent
with
dark
chocolate
up
front
with
a
nice
bitterness
vanilla
and
oak
in
the
rear
with
a
overall
roasted
grain
background
not
terribly
complex
and
better
as
it
reaches
room
temperature
feels
a
tad
thinner
and
not
as
creamy
or
silky
as
i
had
hoped
overall
decent
tasting
brew
but
for
double
the
cost
of
a
fbs
and
the
same
price
as
a
kbs
not
nearly
in
their
class
like
the
peche
mortel
manages
to
do
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
pleasant
level
of
carbonation
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
not
quite
on
the
level
of
peche
mortel
but
still
very
good
not
bad
could
use
more
cocoa
i
expected
a
bit
more
but
enjoyed
it
its
hard
not
to
compare
to
peche
mortel
which
blows
this
away
the
perfect
dessertbeer
very
nice
only
downside
is
the
rather
thin
body
the
flavors
open
with
some
vanilla
sugar
with
burnt
caramel
followed
by
some
cocoa
while
the
vanilla
is
strong
to
the
point
that
its
a
fault
its
not
as
obscene
as
say
st
creme
brulee
or
vanilla
bean
dark
lord
the
vanilla
sweetness
does
get
to
be
a
bit
much
after
a
while
and
the
mild
cocoa
bitterness
and
roasted
malt
character
doesnt
really
counter
it
too
well
the
base
stout
characteristics
are
washed
out
the
beer
finishes
pretty
well
long
with
a
blend
of
vanilla
sweetness
and
burnt
malt
and
cocoa
bitterness
medium
light
in
body
with
a
fairly
high
level
of
carbonation
this
is
decent
on
the
palate
while
im
drinking
my
bottle
i
doubt
i
will
go
back
to
this
this
bottle
certainly
pleased
me
more
than
the
rest
i
had
from
this
six
pack
i
wonder
if
even
more
time
would
make
me
like
this
beer
even
more
something
should
be
dialed
back
on
this
beer
and
i
cant
figure
out
exactly
what
it
is
carbonation
is
an
issue
and
of
course
one
of
the
aftertastes
drinkable
but
you
can
do
better
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
but
not
extremely
thick
black
with
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
that
stays
for
a
little
while
some
lacing
but
nothing
crazy
taste
is
great
with
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
coming
together
perfectly
with
neither
standing
out
too
much
over
the
other
pretty
sweet
in
taste
and
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
rich
not
too
high
in
alcohol
so
the
drinkibility
comes
out
pretty
good
not
sure
you
could
drink
them
all
night
due
to
the
sweet
nature
of
them
but
definitely
good
for
one
or
two
at
any
time
of
the
day
would
probably
be
a
good
desert
beer
smell
is
malty
and
chocolatey
with
nothing
really
overpowering
i
have
had
a
few
and
will
most
likely
have
a
few
more
in
my
time
would
recommend
to
anyone
a
fan
of
sweeter
stouts

twist
off
bottle
purchased
at

in
bethlehem
for
around

uncapped
and
poured
into
my
nonic
imperial
pit
glass
the
stout
appears
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
deep
ecru
colored
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
caramel
chocolate
tootsie
rolls
rich
roasted
grains
dark
chocolate
cocoa
bitter
and
sweet
rather
authentic
tasting
vanilla
which
compliments
the
chocolate
notes
quite
nicely
medium
to
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
finish
leaves
behind
a
pleasant
bitterness
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
a
bit
too
pricey
to
have
regularly

a

this
didnt
really
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
another
amazing
beer
from
dieu
du

man
i
wish
i
could
get
more
of
this
stuff
an
amazing
brewery
and
an
amazing
beer
get
some
easy
to
drink
stout
nice
and
light
for
the
style
with
some
nice
flavor
for
me
probably
not
worth
the
high
price
point
d
a
ton
of
flavor
for
an
american
stout
the
body
is
perfect
and
the
flavor
retains
long
after
it
leaves
your
mouth
not
a
huge
alcohol
beer
but
the
only
thing
holding
this
back
from
being
a
session
beer
is
the
price
tag
m
a
drinkable
well
made
stout
overall
ive
had
too
many
spicedherbedvegetable
stouts
over
the
years
and
this
one
is
pretty
damn
good
it
still
needs
to
find
itself
i
sorta
like
peche
mortel
everytime
i
try
it
but
the
vanilla
blows
it
out
for
me
too
much
downable
with
an
easy
going
quickness
due
to
its
creamy
body
and
chocolatey
yummyness
a
nice
chocolate
ride
for
those
who
have
an
infinity
for
the
cocoa
bean
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
id
love
to
have
access
to
dieu
du
ciel
in
my
area
as
they
seem
to
produce
some
of
my
fave
beers
i
love
trading
d
finally
ive
had
a
stout
predominantly
touting
its
chocolate
vanilla
flavor
that
meets
expectations
the
key
to
this
brew
was
the
subtle
way
in
which
they
used
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
flavors
which
tasted
authentic
they
didnt
try
to
smack
you
in
the
face
and
by
doing
so
actually
enhanced
the
overall
brew
a
great
effort
by
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
these
guys
know
their
stouts
d
i
think
the
vanilla
is
a
little
on
the
low
side
but
it
is
good
i
havent
had
anything
like
this
before
and
thats
another
reason
why
i
enjoy
this
cheers
surprisingly
the
cocoa
flavor
exceeds
my
expectations
based
on
the
smell
think
nestles
quick
added
to
a
milk
stout
still
it
is
appealing
vanilla
is
such
a
delicate
spice
that
i
have
not
found
it
anywhere
the
finish
is
coffeeish
but
short
lived
solid
body
with
a
proper
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
pretty
balanced

pretty
darn
good

as
said
above
would
have
liked
a

more

pretty
solid
offering
though
even
without
the
vanilla
this
is
more
of
a
sit
down
and
enjoy
type
of
beer
to
me
rather
than
an
extended
drinking
beer
however
it
is
a
fantastic
beer
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
leisure
like
probably
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
ever
sampled
the
mouth
is
silky
smooth
and
thick
this
is
a
mouthcoater
for
sure
big
roasted
bitterness
at
the
onset
finishes
mildly
sweet
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
fresh
cream
this
is
a
big
bready
beer
like
a
meal
in
itself
i
loved
this
one
but
its
a
bit
heavy
to
have
one
after
the
other
thick
medium
body
with
the
perfect
balance
of
smooth
silky
chocolate
maltiness
roasted
coffee
burnt
toast
subtle
hops
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
complex
with
the
sweet
notes
from
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
bean
perfectly
balancing
out
the
roasted
coffeeespresso
bean
and
burnt
toast
flavors
slight
alcohol
warmth
but
otherwise
the
abv
is
very
well
masked
none
of
these
flavors
overpower
the
other
instead
they
all
bounce
off
of
each
other
and
im
picking
up
something
different
on
each
sip
this
is
one
of
the
most
wellbalanced
beers
ive
ever
had
i
want
to
slowly
drink
it
and
contemplate
each
sip
but
i
find
myself
drinking
it
pretty
quickly
highly
recommended
d
a
good
drinker
id
love
to
try
it
fresh
on
tap
or
cask
this
stuff
is
ambrosia
if
anything
can
go
head
to
head
with
peche
mortel
its
this
aptly
named
stout
if
youre
gonna
start
dating
a
beer
this
is
the
one
and
if
youre
gonna
share
a
beer
with
a
date
or
special
someone
well
the
same
goes
aphrodisiac
indeed
well
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
we
have
to
pay
for
it
out
here
in
alberta
this
is
phenomenal
stuff
my
bottle
has
the
same
picture
as
shown
above
but
is
called
aphrodite
which
i
assume
is
the
english
versionlabel
for
this
beer
beer
is
jet
black
with
no
head
but
a
small
group
of
bubbles
has
me
confident
this
baby
is
carbonated
smell
is
utter
heaven
wow
probably
the
best
smelling
beer
ive
ever
had
not
overly
complex
but
i
dont
care
vanilla
and
chocolate
combo
is
great
and
reminds
me
of
some
of
the
best
cappucinos
ive
ever
had
but
im
hoping
to
enjoy
this
one
more
beer
is
very
well
balanced
with
as
some
bitterness
drives
through
the
entire
beer
and
holds
it
at
bay
was
worried
it
would
be
too
sweet
after
the
smell
but
that
is
not
the
case
finish
has
a
roasted
bitterness
that
leaves
you
longing
for
more
truly
a
great
beer
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
stellar
solid
stout
nicely
flavoured
with
cocoa
and
vanilla
and
never
too
sweet
theres
not
really
much
more
to
say
other
than
très
magnifique
d
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
as
you
can
see
from
my
review
was
great
as
regular
stouts
go
this
was
clearly
my
favorite
drinkability
amazing
that
so
much
flavor
was
packed
into
a
beer
with
a
relatively
low
abv
much
better
than
many
riss
that
are
shooting
for
the
same
flavor
profile
d
pretty
high
for
a
stout
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
overall
all
in
all
i
would
definitely
pick
this
beer
up
again
and
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
i
think
a
trip
to
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
is
in
order
especially
since
they
make
the
delicious
peche
mortel
as
well
overall
a
solid
stout
offering
i
would
drink
it
again
and
again
i
was
pleased
when
this
one
showed
up
in
alberta
putting
it
on
my
got
list
felt
good
but
not
as
good
as
taking
it
of
my
want
list
this
beer
is
wonderful
and
you
should
pick
it
up
if
you
get
the
chance
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
big
vanilla
and
chocolate
flavors
complementing
the
roasty
rich
malt
backbone
theres
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
to
contrast
the
vanilla
and
chocolate
but
this
is
still
pretty
decadent
and
dessertlike
the
body
felt
a
touch
thin
to
me
mediumlight
but
that
may
be
because
i
was
drinking
bigger
stouts
before
this
quite
good
d
i
thought
this
was
pretty
decent
this
beer
isnt
available
around
here
but
if
i
saw
it
i
might
pick
up
another
bottle
d
this
brewery
has
yet
to
dissapoint
me
very
smooth
and
drinkable
this
is
another
unique
offering
from
these
guys
d
a
good
one
very
smooth
and
round
its
sweet
but
not
overly
so
and
the
somewhat
onesided
character
works
really
well
due
to
the
well
crafted
composition
thanks
jlindros
borderline
sessionable
this
is
drinks
way
way
too
easily

eventually
settled
into
a
fairly
consistent
skim
with
only
a
few
breaks
thick
slashes
of
lacing
were
exposed
after
each
tilt
of
the
glass
cocoa
revealed
upfront
as
well
as
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
and
the
merest
suggestion
of
hops
at
the
back
big
cocoa
character
dominates
the
flavor
profile
with
a
kiss
of
vaniila
in
the
mix
and
a
little
bit
of
bittering
hops
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
mediumlight
and
a
bit
fizzy
would
have
preferred
a
little
less
carbonation
on
this
one
really
drinkable
despite
the
carbonation
level
proof
that
a
beer
can
be
flavorful
with
a
low
abv
however

a
bottle
is
a
bit
steep
in
my
opinion
this
beer
was
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
while
both
the
appearance
and
the
aroma
were
nearly
flawless
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
reminded
me
more
of
a
mediocre
irish
dry
stout
than
a
well
crafted
americanstyle
stout
this
is
an
awesome
beer
probably
my
favorite
stout
right
now
opaque
with
a
very
nice
mocha
head
little

recedes
to
a
thin

roasted

met
my
expectations
perfectly
taste
is
the
same
very
well
balanced
between
the
flavors
and
finishes
with
a
roastyness
that
is
desirable
the
mouthfeel
to
me
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
kind
of
watery
with
an
bit
to
much
attack
from
the
carbonation
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
had
as
of
late
dieu
du
ciel
continues
to
impress
everything
in
this
beer
really
harmonizes
to
emphasize
the
chocolate
but
its
subtle
enough
to
not
seem
gimicky
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
highly
drinkable
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
final
thoughts
this
is
a
very
rich
and
complex
beer
with
lots
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
chocolate
oak
and
vanilla
as
well
as
some
deep
rich
fruit
that
surprises
you
very
light
alcohol
taste
and
makes
my
mouth
water
quite
a
bit
i
think
this
will
age
very
well
also
all
the
flavors
are
blended
pretty
well
and
i
think
aging
it
will
just
round
it
off
even
more
ill
have
to
cellar
a
few
of
them

a
fantastic

and
a
real
rare
treat
from

i
hope
this
one
gets
label
approval
in
the
u
s
soon
because
at

its
a
perfect
example
of
an
attractive
gooddrinking
american
stout
with
a
twist
that
elevates
it
a
step
if
not
a
few
steps
above
the
rest
one
i
would
encourage
anyone
who
gets
the
opportunity
to
try
now
if
only
we
could
brew
peche

with
vanilla
sugar
d
an
easy

stout
as
far
as
they
go

excellent
tasting
this
beer
again
after
a
brief
hiatus
reminded
me
of
what
i
was
missing
similar
to
a
short
breakup
with
a
girlfriend
holy
smokes
what
a
fantastic
beer
if
you
remotely
enjoy
chocolate
or
stouts
and
especially
both
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
sample
this
beverage
extremely
easy
to
drink
delicious
and
delivering
on
every
level
there
is
no
doubt
that
several
bottles
of
this
will
find
it
to
my
basement
to
age
incredible
a
great
gift
brought
by
guests
to
a
dinner
party
ads
stouts
are
her
favorite
beer
style
my
wife
got
to
contribute
to
this
review
a
rarity
pours
a
deep
black
licorice
with
a
pretty
coffee
brown
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
but
returns
with
a
gentle
swirl
of
the
glass
the
scent
is
of
toasted
malt
and
leaves
a
reminder
of
chocolate
milk
the
taste
is
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
a
hint
of
coffee
and
a
faint
caramel
aftertaste
some
creaminess
but
also
a
nice
carbonation
slightly
sweet
especially
late
weve
had
chocolatier
stouts
but
this
was
nicely
balanced
and
really
quite
well
done
i
hope
to
get
this
again
but
ill
likely
have
to
share
it
great
stout
with
such
a
chocolate
smell
upon
first
sip
of
this
youd
think
you
were
eating
a
piece
of
70
cacao
pitch
black
in
color
overly
sweet
smell
but
dry
taste
this
might
be
the
base
malts
for
the
voodoo
donut
brew
they
make
this
was
one
of
the
better
bombers
ive
had
in
a
while
tasted
very
very
fresh
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
stuff
pours
a
little
lighter
then
an
imp
with
a
larger
toffee
colored
head
that
keeps
its
shape
taste
has
lots
of
coffee
didnt
get
any
tobacco
notes
feel
is
awesome
not
slippery
but
more
coarse
overall
the
bottle
i
has
was
fresh
and
i
really
really
enjoyed
it
much
worse
than
its
double
counterpart
too
bitter
and
not
enough
chocolate
for
a
beer
called
chocolate
stout
good
chocolaty
stout
with
tobacco
notes
another
great
beer
from
rogue
v
good
value
its
a
year
since
ive
seen
my
girl
my
lips
missed
your
feel
tongue
your
taste
2
inch
head
is
all
you
need
dark
as
night
smooth
as
water
exactly
everything
i
look
for
in
a
chocolate
stout
too
bitter
for
my
palate
hops
seem
to
overpower
the
chocolate
and
roasted
flavors
whoa
thats
a
lot
of
chocolate
nice
smooth
and
flavorful
makes
a
nice
sipping
beer
amazing
chocolate
stout
with
great
hop
under
notes
was
expecting
more
chocolate
flavor
strong
chocolate
smell
improved
as
it
warmed
up
cheers
o
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
stout
with
good
chocolate
flavors
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
from
the
hops
a
good
amount
of
malt
and
hop
flavors
that
work
together
but
dont
overpower
the
other
i
could
see
this
being
a
staple
in
my
fridge
and
i
will
have
to
get
more
soon
thick
black
strong
chocolate
flavor
i
thought
it
tasted
like
nesquick
with
a
drop
of
liquid
smoke
overall
drink
this
beer
immediately
preferably
with
your
buddies
or
by
yourself
in
front
of
a
fire
on
a
cold
night
it
is
excellent
taste
the
chocolate
taste
is
first
but
it
is
not
as
overwhelmingly
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
be
it
actually
had
a
nice
balance
to
it
with
a
little
bitterness
great
go
to
chocolate
stout
the
new
rebel
hop
really
gives
it
a
bitter
finish
that
isnt
quite
as
subtle
as
the
discontinued
9
ingredient
cascade
hop
version
i
think
the
ibu
on
this
new
version
is
underrated
but
this
stout
is
great
being
as
its
not
an
imperialdouble
stout
it
has
a
slightly
thin
mouthful
and
a
modest
6abv
but
it
makes
up
with
chocolaty
goodness
from
beginning
to
end
i
recommend
this
beer
and
i
believe
it
shines
as
it
warms
as
do
most
stouts
i
recommend
a
slight
chill
our
pull
it
out
of
the
fridge
and
let
it
sit
and
warm
a
bit
i
enjoy
it
from
a
balloon
so
it
warms
in
my
hand
the
slight
complexity
that
is
there
can
be
easily
missed
if
its
to
cold
and
it
will
really
mask
the
bitter
chocolate
taste
overall
very
nice
but
not
necessarily
what
i
expected
the
chocolate
aspect
i
thought
was
phenomenal
but
lighter
bodied
and
too
one
sided
for
my
liking
very
good
though
pours
pitch
black
no
light
getting
through
whatsoever
big
chocolate
and
roasted
smell
taste
is
drier
than
the
smell
led
me
to
believe
but
that
is
nice
since
this
is
so
rich
mouthfeel
is
heavy
as
super
thick
like
a
shake
thick
dense
creaming
head
that
sticks
around
forever
and
coats
the
entire
glass
as
you
drink
this
is
a
great
chocolate
stout
around
the
same
enjoyment
as
samuel
smiths
for
me

never

like
this
beer
for
when
i
have
an
extra
2
bucks
to
toss
at
a
bomber

is
kinda
steep
but
is
it
oh
so
good
cream
of
the
crop
when
it
comes
to
affordable
chocolate
stouts
you
can
find
this
about
anywhere
i
bought
mine
from
safety
but
dont
be
discouraged
just
because
its
common
this
stuff
is
legit
and
i
replace
a
bottle
everytime
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
smooth
taste
but
has
that
stout
bitterness
it
should
dark
in
color
great
in
flavor
good
on
cool
nights

what
a
nice
surprise
this
was
recommended
to
me
by
the

goo
gookey
chew
great
chocolate
stout
tasted
just
like
a
liquid
candy
bar
put
on
a
little
john
fogerty
and
i
was
ready
to
rock
this
one
at
6
0abv
it
was
a
little
less
than
i
am
used
too
from
a
stout
but
the
wonderful
flavor
and
that
great
smell
of
chocolate
just
really
did
it
for
me
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
thanks
walrus
pitch
black

with
a
creamy
two

beige
head
with
good

and
great
lacing
the
nose
is

and
really
lives
up
to
the
name
tons
of
cocoa
and
dark
chocolate
along
with
hints
of
milk
chocolate
oats
and
vanilla
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
chocolate
again
dominating
but
with
a
distinct
bitterness
hints
of
cocoa
caramel
leather
vanilla
oats
and
roasty
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
dry
bittersweet
finish
overall
this
surprised
me
as
i
was
expecting
a
sweet
and
syrupy
artificial
mess
but
instead
got
a
much
more
natural
tasting
chocolate
stout
o
pretty
beer
love
the
bronzecopper
head
solid
retention
and
collaring
dress
the
glass
nicely
very
sweet
probably
works
best
for
a

or
after

the

were

a
pretty

with

strong

the

thin

very
strong
and
stained
the
glass
big
time
as
i
drank
the
brew
down
very
nice
to
look
at
nose
was
guess
chocolate
candied
sugar
caramel
nougat
and
a
little
rumlike
ester
all
were
appetizing
to
smell
but
none
were
presented
or
combined
in
an
impressive
way
taste
was
guess
chocolate
and
candied
sugar
had
a
dry
hoppy
finish
but
of
the
bitter
sort
youd
find
in
good
chocolate
even
better
was
its
almost
fruity
espresso
flavors
in
the
middle
of
its
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
a
fizz
that
came
from
the
head
and
hops
a
very
straightforward
beer
but
by
no
means
boring
and
one
of
the
better
stouts
out
of
the
six
famous
and
beeradvocate
highlyranked
ones
ive
had
recently
simple
and
simply
edible
this
is
a
tasty
stout
i
am
welcome
to
return
to
with
a
way
too
easy
mouthfeel
and
skilled
brewing
its
a
beer
version
of
milk
chocolate

personally
this
rogue
beer
is
the
only
worth
trying
rogue
beer
out
there
i
have
tried
a
couple
other
kinds
of
theirs
and
this
one
was
the
only
one
that
tasted
exactly
like
it
was
advertised
very
good
chocolate
stout
for
those
out
there
that
like
their
stouts
actually
sweet
with
chocolate
versus
the
oatmeal
or
bitter
taste
it
has
a
noncreamy
mouthfeel
it
is
so
missing
that
big
chocolate
stoutness
but
it
has
a
great
easier
drinking
vibe
i
can
easily
finish
the
bomber
and
live
to
drink
something
else
afterwards
o
a
surprise
package
smacks
of
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
but
in
such
a
light
taste
overall
undecided
still
unsure
of
rogue
yeast
tho
to
this
palate
with
overall
aftertaste
excellent
beer
going
to
have
to
have
a
go
at
brewing
a
chocolate
stout
now
i
have
seen
this
beer
in
the
fridge
at
work
for
months
though
never
tried
it
i
decided
to
give
her
a
go
and
purchased
a
22oz
bottle
with
my
food
i
poured
the
beer
and
it
looked
fantastic
i
am
a
fan
of
stouts
so
i
had
high
hopes
i
took
a
whiff
and
the
beer
impressed
me
once
again
it
was
only
when
i
proceeded
to
take
a
taste
that
i
realized
that
this
was
not
my
brew
the
initial
taste
was
delightful
but
then
easily
overpowered
by
strong
hints
of
cocoa
powder
i
read
the
bottle
and
they
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
by
describing
it
as
chocolate
truffle
too
choco
for
me
i
would
recommend
to
a
friend
merely
for
kicks
as
a
novelty
beer
o
a
good
chocolate
stout
easy
drinking
and
tasty
this
is
an
excellent
chocolate
stout
the
appearance
is
chocolatey
the
smell
is
that
of
chocolate
and
the
taste
is
right
on
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
overall
i
would
call
this
the
standard
for
all
chocolate
stouts
then
again
if
you
want
more
of
this
have
the
double
chocolate
stout
a
double
serving
of
this
magical
drink
i
will
have
this
regularly
a
beer
that
is
great
by
itself
but
i
think
it
would
excel
paired
with
a
dessert
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
black
with
a
great
tannish
head
first
sniff
and
im
in
heaven
pure
chocolate
expecting
a
sweetness
due
to
the
aroma
but
this
beer
is
not
sweet
at
all
lots
of
body
and
flavor
and
goes
down
well
a
very
impressive
beer
cant
wait
to
try
the
double
chocolate
pours
a
pitchblack
in
color
with
a
3finger
tan
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
you
can
smell
the
imported
chocolate
right
off
the
bat
with
some
malts
hops
the
taste
is
to
be
expected
lots
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
just
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
which
is
from
the
various
hops
the
9
ingredients
2row
c120
chocolate
malts
cascade
hops
rolled
oats
roasted
barley
chocolate
free
range
coastal
water
and
pacman
yeast
is
written
on
the
right
side
of
the
bottle
if
you
like
chocolate
stouts
that
is
loaded
with
taste
then
this
is
for
you
first
rogue
that
i
have
had
and
they
make
several
different
types
overall
a
enjoyable
brew
i
would
of
rated
it
higher
if
not
for
the
slight
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
overall
pretty
solid
american
stout
now
i
why
it
has
been
rated
the
most
for
this
style
quite
enjoyable
o
i
didnt
expect
much
as
rogue
produces
mostly
okay
but
unspectacular
offerings
i
thought
this
one
was
the
bomb
diggety
loved
it
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
well
crafted
the
nose
is
pure
chocolate
and
the
taste
is
nicely
complex
the
main
problem
i
have
is
that
the
nose
suggest
something
sweet
and
what
you
get
at
first
is
sour
and
bitter
i
also
miss
roasted
barley
that
is
typical
for
the
style
anyway
will
definitely
get
this
again
overall
perhaps
a
little
too
tart
for
my
tastes
but
its
not
so
extreme
that
i
dont
want
to
finish
it
o
smells
better
than
it
tastes
but
its
still
a
really
good
chocolate
stout
their
double
chocolate
stout
is
better
dark
pour
mostly
chocolate
in
aroma
and
flavor
nice
not
too
rich
easy
to
drink
for
sure
wish
there
were
more
flavor
profiles
but
they
did
nail
the
chocolate
part
good
but
not
a
stand
out
for
me
overall
another
shitty
beer
from
rogue
i
cant
see
ill
be
buying
anything
more
from
these
guys
o
super
tasty
chocolate
stout
thats
not
overly
sweet
many
different
flavors
come
out
and
all
have
their
fair
share
of
presence
in
your
mouth
go
out
and
buy
this
i
was
impressed
by
the
rich
espresso
color
of
this
stout
it
had
a
perfect
mouthfeel
i
could
pick
up
on
the
chocolate
flavor
without
it
being
overpowering
is
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
just
the
perfect
level
of
carbonation
and
a
pleasantly
bitter
finish
it
may
sound
crazy
but
it
had
the
after
taste
of
a
tootsie
roll
i
have
not
had
a
lot
of
chocolate
stouts
but
after
this
one
i
will
be
seeking
them
out
popped
the
cap
smells
of
chocolate
milkshake
come
to
mind
pours
jet
black
with
a
one
finger
milk
chocolate
colored
head
taste
is
good
not
quite
as
rich
as
id
hoped
for
so
looking
forward
to
trying
the
double
chocolate
stout
honestly
this
tastes
like
a
hersheys
kiss
i
just
wish
it
had
more
of
an
alcohol
zip
the
the
southern
tier
creme
brûlée
great
beer
though
my
wife
likes
would
definitely
buy
again
o
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
a
great
representation
of
it
exactly
what
the
label
declares
chocolate
stout
good
balance
creamy
mouthfeel
plenty
of
chocolate
well
done
beer
by
rogue
this
chocolate
stout
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
its
a
lovely
be
chocolate
brown
and
the
head
is
a
beautiful
mocha
brown
it
smells
vaguely
of
chocolate
in
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
the
deep
malts
roasting
notes
and
of
course
in
some
chocolate
the
mouth
feel
is
also
very
very
well
done
and
the
carbonation
is
perfect
score
overall
awesome
beer
this
is
a
poor
beer
i
do
not
understand
the
love
for
it
on
this
site
the
beer
has
little
flavor
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
chocolate
flavor
the
poorest
aspect
of
this
is
the
mouthfeel
so
thin
nothing
redeeming
about
this
beer
that
i
can
tell
i
used
to
like
rogue
shakespeare
stout
and
id
heard
that
this
was
better
i
hesitate
to
even
try
old
billy
shakes
if
this
is
better
did
a
tasting
from
two
bombers
the
older
12ingredient
version
and
the
new
9ingredient
one
with
real
chocolate
and
less
hop
basically
that
was
the
difference
and
i
thought
the
previous
12
ingredient
version
was
better
more
unique
the
new
version
definitely
has
a
smoother
more
delicious
chocolate
flavor
but
without
that
hop
background
it
tastes
just
like
any
other
quality
chocolate
stout
the
original
12ingredient
had
something
special
in
that
combination
overall
a
good
beer
one
that
i
will
be
buying
again
in
the
near
future
overall
solid
offering
worth
the
try
a
bit
pricey
and
starts
out
strong
but
slowly
declines
a
delicious
stout
that
approaches
the
threshold
of
being
too
sweet
a
nice
dessert
stout
overall
a
really
nice
beer
its
not
as
heavy
as
i
thought
and
the
drinkability
was
really
nice
o
this
is
by
far
the
most
rich
chocolate
beer
ive
ever
had
it
is
delicious
reviewed
22507
split
a
22oz
bottle
with
a
friend
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
brown
head
the
aroma
is
mixture
of
cocoa
and
malts
i
was
expecting
a
heavy
dense
volume
with
this
but
instead
its
rather
light
and
creamy
the
most
obvious
taste
being
the
unsweetened
chocolate
and
malts
i
was
expecting
a
little
something
more
and
different
from
this
one
definitely
on
my
nice
list
high
c
overall
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
and
one
food
pairing
suggestion
raw
chocolate
chip
cookie
dough
with
this
beer
is
a
revelation
o
i
know
this
has
gotten
some
really
good
ratings
but
i
dont
see
why
there
was
very
little
taste
to
this
beer
and
the
chocolate
didnt
add
anything
to
it
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
mf
thin
dry
a
little
astringent
minerally
oi
really
enjoyed
this
one
quite
thick
quite
sweet
and
quite
dominant
i
stout
that
runs
up
to
you
gets
in
your
face
and
demands
that
you
like
it
despite
the
fact
that
the
hardcore
beer
drinkers
think
its
a
sissy
beer
because
contains
chocolate
a
bold
and
brash
boss
who
lets
you
know
who
is
in
the
building
i
really
like
these
thick
and
rich
stouts
that
arent
jam
packed
full
of
alcohol
this
is
a
good
one
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
i
cant
remember
if
i
like
it
better
than
their
regular
oatmeal
stout
or
not
as
its
been
a
while
i
recall
liking
it
tho
and
i
would
guess
this
one
is
somewhat
similar
in
overall
nature
this
beer
had
a
nice
scent
to
it
not
sure
if
cocoa
nibs
was
used
or
just
the
chocolate
malt
but
either
way
i
couldnt
get
the
scent
right
taste
had
a
overpowering
smoked
flavor
that
had
a
alcohol
finish
i
wanted
more
chocolate
but
overall
not
a
bad
stout
just
not
their
best
i
would
stick
with
their
oatmeal
stout
overall
this
is
pretty
good
im
not
sure
i
like
it
as
much
as
samuel
smiths
chocolate
stout
but
that
may
also
be
because
im
new
to
this
style
its
not
exactly
my
style
as
i
prefer
a
creamier
milkier
chocolate
stout
like
some
russian
imperials
or
american
double
stouts
its
more
of
a
well
rounded
beer
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
go
into
this
expecting
a
beer
with
some
chocolate
not
a
chocolate
stout
o
powerful
stout
the
chocolate
is
overwhelming
in
a
good
way
pretty
low
abv
for
a
stout
with
this
much
flavor
but
thats
okay
sweet
and
roasty
would
have
again
o
this
is
the
best
chocolate
stout
that
i
have
had
thats
why
my
fridge
always
has
one
glad
this
one
is
made
year
round
i
tend
to
balk
at
spending
over
5
dollars
for
a
bomber
of
beer
but
ive
never
been
disappointed
with
a
rogue
product
and
consider
the
money
as
wellspent
this
is
hands
down
the
best
chocolate
stout
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
to
date
i
keep
searching
for
something
equal
or
better
tasting
as
i
dont
see
it
often
up
in
maine
but
alas
to
no
avail
this
beer
has
just
the
most
perfect
blend
of
true
chocolate
flavor
not
too
sweet
its
like
desert
in
a
bottle
for
me
o
very
nice
beer
i
didnt
have
a
lot
of
expectations
for
this
beer
so
i
am
pretty
darn
impressed
the
flavors
are
great
its
sweet
but
not
overpowering
its
a
great
dessert
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
and
would
recommend
it
to
someone
looking
for
a
milder
version
of
southern
tiers
choklat
o
this
would
make
a
rocksolid
everyday
stout
if
it
were
a
in
6
packs
and
b
less
expensive
its
still
a
decent
offering
and
better
than
the
double
o
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
a
light
stout
that
can
be
enjoyed
any
day
this
beer
really
has
both
sides
of
the
equation
it
has
the
nice
robust
chocolate
taste
upfront
followed
by
a
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
which
makes
this
beer
very
wellrounded
and
enjoyable
to
most
beer
drinkers
you
really
dont
fell
the
69
ibus
great
stout
and
well
balanced
not
overly
complex
focusing
on
what
is
promising
chocolate
a
must
for
chocolate
lovers
o
competent
if
not
complex
the
components
of
this
beer
dont
for
me
add
up
to
an
outstanding
whole
id
drink
it
again
and
it
is
solidly
aboveaverage
but
somehow
seems
slightly
lacking
o
the
chocolate
presence
is
there
but
more
with
flavors
of
cocoa
than
a
candy
bar
the
dose
of
hops
adds
an
interesting
twist
to
the
finish
pours
seal
brown
with
a
modest
mocha
head
of
coarse
bubbles
aroma
smells
of
milk
and
dark
chocolates
coffee
and
citric
hops
flavor
is
surprisingly
mild
considering
the
aroma
im
thinking
this
may
require
considerable
warming
to
get
the
most
out
of
it
for
now
im
getting
a
well
balanced
blend
of
roasted
malt
tending
toward
coffee
and
earthy
citric
hops
a
delightful
mocha
haze
sneaks
up
late
in
the
aftertaste
some
milk
chocolate
is
there
but
its
very
faint
in
comparison
to
the
more
acrid
elements
to
be
honest
id
be
hardpressed
to
brand
this
a
chocolate
stout
when
i
think
of
the
many
stouts
out
there
with
a
far
great
chocolate
character
even
rogues
own
shakespeare
stout
has
a
stronger
chocolate
presence
in
my
opinion
i
had
this
a
couple
years
ago
and
recall
having
much
the
same
impression
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
zippy
perhaps
a
little
too
much
so
for
the
style
with
that
said
this
remains
a
drinkable
stout
with
a
nice
roasted
character
albeit
short
on
the
eponymous
chocolate
the
taste
is
dry
chocolatey
with
a
strong
burnt
maltiness
touches
of
coffee
mix
with
the
chocolate
and
present
an
espresso
creaminess
theres
some
watery
tones
that
end
with
a
metal
like
feel
at
the
aftertaste
but
its
not
so
offputting
as
to
keep
one
from
enjoying
a
really
good
stout
as
good
as
a
chocolate
stout
can
get
this
is
divine
pours
a
velvety
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
milkshake
head
mocha
in
color
sudsy
and
lasting
the
nose
is
a
mix
of
milk
and
dark
chocolate
not
overly
sweet
but
definitely
real
chocolate
well
roasted
malts
are
nice
and
dark
and
earthy
but
not
burnt
to
the
point
of
being
bitter
the
flavor
is
remarkably
chocolate
heavy
its
almost
like
youngs
but
the
sweetness
isnt
as
intense
thankfully
there
is
a
very
organic
nature
to
this
its
like
adult
dessert
i
really
like
it
not
incredibly
complex
but
more
of
a
simple
and
straightforward
brew
with
little
to
distract
the
drinker
from
the
robust
chocolate
flavors
and
smooth
creamy
feel
everything
is
balanced
perfectly
the
flavors
here
are
just
fantastic
full
body
amazingly
smooth
and
it
changes
from
cold
to
warm
quite
a
bit
carbonation
is
mellow
all
the
way
through
just
enough
to
wash
it
down
clean
overall
this
might
be
the
best
beer
rogue
makes
and
thats
saying
something
i
am
still
yet
to
try
their
double
chocolate
though
so
who
knows
not
subtle
and
perhaps
not
real
sessionable
but
a
definite
pleasure
to
drink
for
this
chocolate
lover
well
done
rogue
o
this
beer
seems
really
overrated
partially
because
i
tend
to
think
ba
is
in
love
with
hoppy
beers
non
matter
what
the
style
and
partially
because
of
rogues
reputation
for
good
brews
this
is
not
even
in
my
top
5
of
chocolate
stouts
and
not
in
my
top
of
10
stouts
i
like
hops
in
an
ipa
not
my
chocolate
stouts
this
is
not
one
of
rogues
typically
verry
good
beers
for
a
stout
it
is
weak
on
flavor
lacks
the
typical
sweetstrong
boldness
i
like
in
a
stout
having
said
that
it
is
still
a
good
beer
just
not
up
to
the
rogue
standard
ive
come
to
expect
worth
trying
but
not
one
of
my
future
go
to
beers
sweet
chocolate
mixed
with
a
nice
stout
and
to
reiterate
hersheys
syrup
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
tall
mug
pours
a
very
dark
brownblack
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
the
chocolate
is
noticeable
right
away
while
pouring
its
a
darker
chocolate
flavor
and
smells
absolutely
delicious
taste
is
surprisingly
hoppy
and
bitter
but
the
dark
chocolate
flavor
softens
the
blow
this
is
almost
like
a
cross
between
an
ipa
and
a
stout
the
hops
bring
a
slight
sting
while
the
chocolate
and
oats
add
creaminess
to
the
palate
mouth
is
very
creamy
goes
down
so
smooth
i
could
drink
this
all
day
second
tasting
after
trying
this
a
second
time
i
have
changed
my
mind
being
from
the
uk
i
am
used
to
a
british
style
of
stout
as
that
was
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
disappointed
this
time
around
i
took
a
more
open
minded
sip
this
is
actually
a
very
tasty
and
balanced
beer
i
still
find
it
some
what
a
hybrid
to
my
tastes
but
a
real
tasty
one
i
hope
to
try
more
from
rogue
ales
overall
an
absolutely
amazing
stout
wonderful
stunning
sexy
beer
just
wow
just
watching
pour
out
into
a
glass
is
magic
sitting
in
your
glass
waiting
to
be
drank
is
almost
too
much
too
bear
its
a
os
chocolate
oh
yeah
enjoy
this
beer
i
can
find
a
thing
wrong
so
enjoy
this
beer
good
times
d
enjoyable
chocolate
stout
but
probably
not
my
first
choice
for
the
style
overall
it
was
certainly
worth
trying
but
id
still
put
it
below
ddcs
aphrodisiaque
another
solid
beer
from
the
folks
at
rogue
good
stuff
thanks
to
kirk
for
this
one
overall
this
was
an
extremely
enjoyable
experience
couldnt
recommend
this
enough
both
to
the
hop
head
andor
the
stout
lover
loved
this
one
a
solid
beer
and
it
definitely
delivers
on
its
chocolate
taste
but
it
wasnt
quite
complex
enough
for
me
just
a
chocolate
beer
by
itself
leaves
me
feeling
like
something
was
lacking
i
also
have
to
say
that
i
would
like
a
little
higher
abv
with
a
beer
like
this
and
it
only
checks
in
at
6
percent
overall
anytime
i
want
to
smell
yummy
liquid
chocolate
this
is
a
great
pick
but
there
are
many
better
tasting
stouts
out
there
though
this
one
is
solid
o
a
good
chocolate
stout
enjoyable
but
not
my
absolute
favorite
of
the
group
flavor
does
improve
substantially
as
it
nears
room
temperature
prost
lampertland
rogue
chocolate
stout
45
overall
a
very
pleasant
stout
to
drink
is
heavy
and
creamy
the
bitter
cocoa
powder
flavor
is
marked
and
lasts
in
your
mouth
like
a
heavy
mocha
coffee
goes
down
easily
alcohol
barely
noticeable
this
opens
up
as
reaching
towards
room
temp
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
definitely
o
not
a
bad
one
though
im
not
sure
i
cared
for
how
much
it
changed
as
it
warmed
up
i
think
its
not
one
to
sip
slowly
o
a
chocolate
stout
that
delivers
on
the
chocolate
flavor
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
great
looking
opaqueblack
pour
with
a
nice
adequate
1
finger
mocca
head
smell
was
baking
chocolates
up
front
with
semisweet
chocolate
on
the
back
fits
the
name
and
thats
what
i
was
looking
for
maybe
some
burnt
malts
stuffed
in
there
but
huge
chocolate
taste
was
melted
chocolate
bars
with
a
little
hop
finish
again
some
dark
fruitsmalts
are
there
but
the
chocolate
takes
center
stage
on
this
chocolate
stout
bomb
i
get
a
blend
of
different
chocolate
which
is
nice
baking
semi
sweet
and
dark
combination
feel
is
middle
of
the
road
and
quite
silkycreamy
mild
carbonation
on
this
which
is
just
fine
overall
it
is
what
it
is
a
chocolate
stout
with
not
a
ton
of
bells
and
whistles
if
you
like
chocolate
in
your
beer
this
is
right
there
for
you
not
over
the
top
but
a
good
sipper
and
pretty
enjoyable
a
solid
effort
that
hit
the
spot
for
me
not
the
best
out
there
but
work
the
try
pour
is
deep
brown
with
a
longlasting
khaki
head
and
great
lacing
sweet
chocolate
hershey
syrup
lacto
light
roast
and
coffee
in
the
aroma
taste
is
much
more
roasty
dark
chocolate
a
hit
watered
down
caramel
coffee
and
anise
with
a
lightly
roasted
bitter
finish
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
not
bad
for
a
chocolate
stout
which
im
not
always
too
crazy
about
too
much
hops
making
the
beer
more
bitter
than
sweet
o
this
is
truly
a
chocolate
tasting
chocolate
stout
yet
since
the
chocolate
has
an
unsweetened
character
it
fits
really
well
into
really
good
oatmeal
stout
the
result
of
this
combination
is
a
pleasing
blend
and
balance
of
unsweetened
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
grains
along
with
the
some
earthy
and
slightly
spicy
hops
to
add
complexity
o
this
is
pretty
good
as
some
nice
complex
flavors
come
out
yet
it
doesnt
overly
excite
though
it
could
pass
for
a
milksweet
stout
id
have
this
again
o
good
beer
great
beer
in
fact
just
didnt
deliver
much
on
its
promise
did
it
smell
chocolatey
oh
yes
did
it
taste
chocolatey
perhaps
same
as
most
stout
it
had
that
roasted
dark
chocolate
character
but
unfortunately
it
wasnt
much
of
anything
special
the
smell
was
more
exciting
and
new
than
the
flavor
but
the
flavor
still
stood
up
as
a
strong
enjoyable
stout
i
will
drink
this
again
but
not
when
im
in
the
mood
for
strong
chocolate

oi
fully
enjoyed
this
beer
and
is
probably
the
only
rogue
beer
i
would
buy
again
because
of
their
high
prices
not
flavor
most
of
their
beers
are
way
over
priced
but
this
one
is
worth
every
penny
for
sure
when
i
go
to
a
friends
house
im
bringin
this
one
for
dessert
such
a
well
done
chocolate
beer
thanks
rogue
for
this
offering
overall
i
love
this
brew
one
of
the
best
flavored
stouts
ive
ever
had
leave
it
to
rogue
which
is
amongst
my
top
10
favorite
brewers
in
america
to
master
a
perfectly
balanced
chocolate
stout
in
every
way
imaginable
once
again
they
cease
to
amaze

a

of

hmm
chocolate

taste

this
almost
drinks
too
fast
im
usually
a
bit
of
a
purist
when
it
comes
to
flavored
beers
but
this
one
is
very
well
done
o
the
perfect
beer
for
dessert
a
great
mood
beer
not
one
to
fit
in
a
regular
stout
rotation
due
to
the
sweet
character
of
this
one
but
very
enjoyable
in
the
appropriate
occasion
also
make
a
great
surprisechange
of
pace
i
think
ill
gift
a
couple
this
year
www
brewreviewboston
blogspot
com
o
a
very
distinguishedtasting
beer
forward
in
approach
embracing
the
style
with
a
simple
elegance
this
is
one
that
is
great
for
introducing
people
to
beer
or
at
least
helping
them
realize
how
diverse
beer
can
be
it
is
also
a
great
food
beer
pairing
well
with
chocolate
but
also
ice
cream
rogue
you
have
changed
my
mind
now
my
quest
to
emulate
this
brew
at
home
begins
oas
advertised
this
is
a
chocolate
stout
and
a
good
one
at
that
is
this
the
best
chocolate
stout
out
there
no
but
if
you
want
to
sip
on
a
dessert
beer
that
wont
bowl
you
over
with
abv
this
is
a
nice
choice
in
complexity
and
taste
too
often
i
find
that
brewers
like
to
hype
their
chocolate
beers
but
rarely
do
they
deliver
on
actual
chocolate
flavor
this
offering
is
one
of
the
few
chocolate
beers
that
can
be
marked
as
advertised
complement
this
beer
with
a
silent
watching
of
foxxy
brown
movie
while
listening
to
grace
jones
singing
la
vie
en
rose
and
more
of
her
techno
punky
miracles
final
thoughts
although
the
flavor
profile
on
this
one
was
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
its
a
unique
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
chocolate
stout
would
i
drink
it
again
probably
not
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
i
feel
the
need
to
revisit
poured
this
from
a
bomber
into
a
drink
vermont
beer
pint
glass
had
a
nice
tan
2
finger
head
that
receded
to
about
a
quarter
inch
not
very
aromatic
but
black
as
night
feel
is
good
medium
bodied
for
a
stout
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
what
really
gets
me
it
tastes
like
a
chocolate
milk
with
far
more
chocolate
than
necessary
its
fantastic
but
really
all
chocolate
and
quite
delicious
definitely
a
chocoholics
dream
overall
not
bad
this
is
rated
higher
than
southern
tiers

rogue
does
not
disappoint
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
had
the
chocolate
is
perfectly
placed
it
is
noticeable
but
much
more
bitter
than
i
expected
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
this
reminds
me
of
a
higher
cocoa
percentage
chocolate
bar
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
disappointing
as
it
is
pretty
thin
the
carbonation
is
a
little
too
high
for
the
style
its
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
large
head
the
smell
is
that
of
just
an
everyday
stout
and
the
taste
is
that
too
i
mean
but
not
disappointing

so
if
you
love
dark
beers
but
dont
want
something
heavy
and
just
tastes
great
pick
one
of
these
up
my
local
stores

medium

but
doesnt
have
overwhelming

or

to
make
this
an
extremely
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
overall
a
great
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
it
is
really
top
100
quality
but
good
and
everyone
should
check
it
out
drinkability
this
beer
is
truly
outstanding
this
is
the
best
all
around
beer
ive
ever
had
in
my
life
there
could
be
better
ones
out
there
but
as
for
right
now
this
has
no
competition
in
my
eye
easily
drinkable
i
would
love
to
have
a
keg
of
this
set
up
in
my
house
i
may
have
just
found
my
new
favorite
without
a
doubt
worth
a
try
i
took
my
time
drinking
this
because
i
didnt
want
to
finish
i
didnt
want
it
to
end
i
could
talk
about
this
beer
all
day
incredible
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
is
in
the
100
beers
it
is
below
average
at
best
not
creamy
like
a
good
stout
should
be
the
carbinaton
was
that
of
a
bottle
of
pepsi
i
thought
that
maybe
it
was
me
and
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
2
of
my
other
friends
had
it
also
one
in
colorado
and
one
in
ohio
both
had
the
same
reaction
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
way
overrated
d
highly
drinkable
this
is
one
to
drink
fresh
over
and
over
not
sure
cellaring
would
do
this
beer
any
good
as
the
abv
is
low
and
the
chocolate
would
probably
just
dissapear
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
is
slightly
over

and
pretty

drinking
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
rogue
beers
generally
i
am
underwhelmed
with
that
brewery
but
this
beer
is
pretty
tasty
d
if
you
enjoy
the
dry
bitterness
of

then
the
amazing
dark
chocolate
flavor
will
keep
you
sipping
very
dark
in
appearance
nice

huge
creamy

medium
body
but
the
flavors
did
not
taste
at
all
integrated
each
sip
tasted
like
a
dark
beer
but
then
the
chocolate
aftertaste
lingeredfor
what
seemed
like
forever
i
like

i
like

this
combo
was
not
appealing

me

with
bitterness
like
the
shakespeare
feel
is
creamy
and
fullbodied
although
with
solid
carbonation
for
such
a
heavy
stout
i
could
drink
this
one
until
i
am
stuffed
an
excellent
brew
this
is
the
best
stout
that
i
have
had
to
date
without
a
doubt
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
such
a
big
body
with
the
first
pint
it
feels
and
tastes
like
drinking
a
slightly
bitter
coffee
the
second
pint
as
it
warms
the
smell
and
taste
shift
more
to
the
chocolate
side
of
this
brew
its
probably
not
something
i
will
be
drinking
once
a
week
but
it
makes
for
a
very
good
desert
beer
on
its
own
or
served
with
desert
a
very
interesting
and
intriguing
beer
it
grew
on
my
as
i
drank
it
and
at
the
end
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
gritty
not
very
smooth
maybe
i
was
just
upset
because
the
taste
was
a
bit
boring
and
it
brought
the
mouthfeel
down
as
well
i
cant
really
say
im
dying
to
try
this
again
this
was
a
wonderful
luxurious
experience
cant
say
ive
had
a
stout
like
this
i
have
certainly
tasted
similar
qualities
in
other
stouts
but
never
like
this
i
can
definitely
vouch
for
this
rogue
offering
as
a
cellaring
candidate
if
you
have
a
chance
put
one
away
for
a
year
or
so
and
taste
for
yourself
what
a
great
stout
the
first
few
are
very
drinkable
after
that
i
start
getting
a
tad
full
it
was
a
realy
treat
to
find
this
on
tap
as
good
as
a
chocolate
stout
is
going
to
get
not
as
thick
as
youngs
but
with
a
more
authentic
and
more
embedded
chocolate
taste
this
is
easily
the
most
decadent
beer
i
have
drank
and
also
among
the
most
drinkable
this
is
rogues
best
pours
a
dark
black
with
browns
and
reds
at
the
edges
head
is
a
dark
cream
color
not
too
thick
not
too
thin
smell
is
very
chocolatey
with
some
coffee
and
toffee
dark
and
roasty
all
the
way
with
this
one
taste
is
very
good
tastes
like
a
hearty
stout
mixed
with
chocolate
syrup
then
again
for
all
i
know
that
could
be
the
case
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
unpleasant
this
one
coats
the
mouth
a
bit
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
the
only
downside
to
this
beer
for
me
is
the
drinkability
the
richness
of
it
is
honestly
a
bit
too
much
for
me
very
good
but
i
would
almost
have
to
down
this
one
as
shots
if
you
have
the
constitution
to
overcome
the
sheer
richness
of
it
and
like
chocolate
stouts
id
heartily
recommend
this
one
if
youre
like
me
and
like
something
not
quite
so
overpowering
id
suggest
splitting
it
with
a
friend
delicious
beer
just
hard
to
drink
d
an
amazing
beer
it
is
like
drinking
a
bar
of
great
dark
chocolate
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
is
a
very
light
and
smooth
stout
at
6
its
pretty
drinkable
i
could
down
a
couple
of
bombers
with
ease
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
offering
from
rogue
highly
recommended
drinkability
this
is
excellent
ale
and
sessionable
to
boot
also
would
go
well
for
andor
with
dessert
the
beer
wasnt
as
full
in
the
bottle
as
it
could
have
been
did
that
effect
the
appearance
most
people
rate
it
a
4
to
4
5
i
had
this
from
a
bottle
at
the
rogue
brewery
in
newport
or
it
poured
a
deep
dark
brownblack
color
not
a
large
or
foamy
head
it
had
a
mild
aroma
of
chocolate
and
malt
but
not
overwhelming
the
taste
was
surprisingly
thin
and
watery
for
a
stout
not
fullbodied
at
all
and
the
flavor
of
chocoalte
wasnt
very
strong
i
have
been
on
the
lookout
for
the
perfect
chocolate
stout
here
it
is
so
sexy
creamy
black
on
the
pour
with
sticky
lacing
and
head
aromas
were
slightly
coffee
like
with
some
undertones
of
chocolate
in
the
malt
the
taste
pure
essence
of
cocoa
bittersweet
chocolate
to
the
max
the
absence
of
cloying
sweetness
made
this
brew
absolutely
delicious
some
mild
flowery
sweetness
like
honey
is
in
the
wings
to
round
it
out
and
the
thick
body
can
take
it
goes
down
so
easy
my
tastebuds
are
in
heaven
drinkability
just
okay
didnt
get
a
second
which
is
unusual
too
cold
too
bland
overall
i
really
havent
had
other
beers
to
compare
this
to
that
are
really
so
similar
i
think
it
uses
the
chocolate
extemely
well
in
this
beer
its
loaded
with
flavor
and
i
see
this
being
a
great
digestif
beer
and
if
not
that
a
great
beer
to
have
on
its
own
and
enjoy
its
unique
flavors
d
good
but
not
great
for
a
sweeter
stout
there
are
others
i
prefer
finally
got
to
try
this
fine
rogue
poured
deep
black
as
night
witha
big
creamy
colored
and
audibly
fizzing
head
that
quickly
faded
leaving
behind
a
half
and
inch
of
thick
bubbles
that
laste
almost
to
the
end
deep
thick
brown
lace
dripped
down
the
glass
very
full
looking
smell
was
off
course
dark
german
chocolate
roasted
or
smoked
smells
wafted
through
as
well
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
mousse
as
it
warmed
delighted
the
senses
rich
smells
like
a
chocolate
dessert
very
strong
tastes
followed
suit
well
strong
roasted
chocolate
soo
much
chocolate
incredible
tasted
like
smoked
pudding
very
nice
carbonation
made
it
very
lively
and
a
dry
finish
capped
it
off
very
well
this
is
a
big
dessert
bear
easily
the
most
filling
beer
i
have
ever
tried
i
actually
felt
bloated
after
this
no
real
alcohol
at
all
detected
in
this
and
at
a
low
abv
i
wouldnt
expect
one
suge
huge
bold
flavors
in
such
a
low
abv
are
a
welcome
treat
and
make
this
very
drinkable
the
smooth
creamy
full
flavor
and
texture
and
overall
chocolate
overload
make
this
the
perfect
night
cap
very
well
done
took
the
bottle
from
the
fridge
and
poured
it
right
into
a
clean
glass
completely
black
with
a
big
brown
head
great
head
retention
and
lacing
almost
odorless
which
was
strange
may
have
been
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
smell
or
it
could
just
be
in
my
mind
because
of
the
name
medium
carbonation
with
a
mediumfull
body
seemed
a
little
bland
for
a
stout
but
the
little
bit
of
flavor
that
was
there
was
very
nice
i
could
certainly
taste
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
good
balance
of
hops
too
no
taste
of
alcohol
present
overall
a
slightly
above
average
stout
thats
very
drinkable
im
still
stumped
by
the
lack
of
smell
though
which
really
brings
the
score
down
for
this
one
i
had
this
from
a
22oz
bomber
bottle
poured
an
almost
black
liquor
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
that
dissipated
almost
immediately
the
smell
was
reminicent
of
earthy
and
chocolatey
tones
there
is
an
initial
bitterness
that
quickly
turns
to
a
smokey
choclate
flavor
it
lingers
in
the
mouth
for
a
while
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
heavy
this
is
definitely
not
your
watery
yellow
fizzy
beer
d
filling
and
delicious
desert
brew
good
brew
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
chocolate
but
id
recommend
this
d
i
was
truly
looking
forward
to
this
one
for
some
time
now
but
it
came
up
a
little
short
i
definitely
want
to
try
it
on
tap
to
get
a
second
opinion
drinkability
a
great
brew
light
chocolatey
and
delicious
i
feel
this
brew
is
lighter
probably
because
ive
had
russian
imperial
and
double
stouts
recently
a
wonderful
stout
to
have
on
a
cold
winter
night
overall
the
low
carbonation
and
full
body
made
this
a
smooth
creamy
brew
its
a
pleasant
experience
in
small
doses
after
half
a
bomber
i
was
ready
for
something
else
d
it
seems
like
this
could
be
a
hard
beer
to
get
as
right
as
rogue
did
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
how
well
balanced
everything
is
went
great
with
a
big
cheeseburger
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
end
what
more
does
there
need
to
be
said
close
to
a
perfect
5
imo
whoa
this
is
super
drinkable
i
could
have
these
all
night
d
easily
drinkable
but
after
a
couple
of
glasses
it
becomes
almost
too
sweet
but
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
my
girlfriend
really
loves
this
one
this
tasty
treat
poured
a
shadeandahalf
away
from
being
jetblack
with
a
sizeable
lightly
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
retention
the
head
subsides
but
begins
as
exceptionally
creamy
the
smell
is
raisiny
with
very
rich
dark
chocolate
moving
to
the
front
cocoa
fills
the
nose
the
taste
is
incredible
rich
and
smooth
yet
dark
and
a
surprising
if
you
dont
read
the
bottle
entrance
of
hops
that
get
stronger
on
the
finish
a
bit
smoky
and
a
ton
delicioius
very
creamy
yet
light
in
the
mouth
and
perhaps
the
most
drinkable
stout
ive
had
d
grandmas
homemade
brownies
in
a
bottle
extremely
well
balanced
without
being
too
sweet
this
is
the
best
chocolate
flavored
beer
that
i
have
tried
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
20oz
dimpled
mug
poured
a
dark
opaque
black
with
a
thin
head
that
was
diminishing
and
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
an
almost
indescribable
abundance
of
chocolate
with
usual
stout
undertones
of
roasted
barley
and
subtle
coffee
all
very
overpowered
by
chocolate
however
the
taste
was
great
but
just
a
tad
on
the
bitter
side
as
far
as
the
chocolate
was
concerned
the
mouthfeel
was
fully
tolerable
with
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
winter
night
this
would
be
an
outstanding
desert
beer
its
really
desert
by
itself
almost
like
a
tootsie
roll
in
a
glass
purchased
at
sams
650ml
bottle
chilled
and
poured
into
a
nonic
head
has
dissipated
into
two
centimeter
milk
chocolate
crème
lingering
on
surface
with
nice
lacing
the
body
is
oily
black
opaque
seriously
does
look
like
an
i
s
smells
of
subtle
light
smoky
chocolate
character
which
permeates
the
totality
of
this
drink
the
roasted
barley
and
oaks
as
listed
on
the
bottle
manifests
and
aids
nicely
to
form
an
earthy
wellrounded
complexity
the
cascades
at
first
were
rather
forward
but
as
this
warms
up
they
mellow
out
and
the
chocolate
is
allowed
to
come
to
the
fore
taste
wise
this
beer
is
rich
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
has
many
flavor
components
of
a
sturdy
ris
but
simply
lacks
the
strength
and
thicker
mouthfeel
i
realize
this
is
not
what
they
were
going
for
but
worth
mentioning
the
mouthfeel
definitely
has
a
literal
chocolate
residual
feel
made
with
imported
chocolate
this
is
very
much
a
worth
while
stout
the
complexity
of
an
imperial
stout
but
the
strength
and
mouth
feel
of
a
standard
stout
totally
worth
a
drink

unfortunately
this
beer
is
quite
difficult
at
least
in
nj
to
track
down
damn
the
big
frothy
thick
head
doesnt
go
away
very
fast
leaving
a
nice
lacing
behind
the
color
is
black
so
much
so
that
light
doesnt
penetrate
at
all
the
flavor
is
sooo
chocolatey
with
a
big
coffee
flavor
behind
it
its
awsome
i
love
this
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
harsh
with
carbonation
at
first
but
i
suppose
that
will
mellow
when
the
co2
has
run
its
course
overall
i
will
get
more
of
this
beautiful
brew
cheers
my
girlfriend
and
i
tried
this
beer
last
week
and
we
loved
it
i
liked
the
aroma
and
taste
of
this
stout
my
girlfriend
doesnt
do
beer
all
that
much
but
she
liked
the
chocolate
stout
so
much
so
that
we
took
home
a
few
bottles
it
went
well
with
some
chicken
we
had
i
really
recommend
it
silky
smooth
rich
mouthfeel
very
nice
to
drink
drinkability
in
a
world
of
so
many
imperial
this
and
double
that
it
is
nice
to
find
a
full
bodied
and
flavorful
stout
that
only
clocks
in
a
6
alcohol
this
is
a
great
drink
and
one
that
you
can
have
a
few
of
plenty
of
complexity
while
still
demonstrating
the
fine
art
of
restraint
a
very
tasty
after
dinner
treat
its
a
dessert
in
its
own
right
but
i
recently
had
the
experience
of
tasting
this
with
ice
cream
in
it
and
while
not
for
everyone
is
freaking
fantastic
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
an
almost
opaque
dark
dark
brown
with
two
fingers
of
dense
dark
tan
foam
modest
lacing
left
on
the
glass
with
each
sip
smells
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
hops
and
roasted
malts
tastes
foremost
of
milk
chocolate
cocoa
powder
then
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
followed
by
a
nice
hop
bitterness
smooth
and
creamy
with
mild
to
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
really
good
chocolate
stout
one
that
i
always
like
to
keep
on
hand
pours
jet
black
with
a
perfect
tan
head
that
has
great
retention
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
sweet
chocolate
as
one
would
expect
but
there
is
also
a
strong
roasted
malt
aroma
taste
is
slightly
fruity
up
front
quickly
followed
up
with
a
big
dose
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
there
is
also
a
subtle
hopiness
in
the
back
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
finishes
pretty
dry
drinkability
is
great
i
hadnt
seen
this
beer
on
the
shelf
for
a
long
time
around
here
and
when
i
did
i
jumped
at
the
chance
to
pick
this
beer
back
up
another
great
beer
from
rogue
overalldrinkability
a
damn
fine
american
stout
well
done
rogue
i
look
forward
to
trying
rogues
shakespeare
stout
next
grab
a
bomber
and
enjoy
cheers
there
is
some
small
print
on
the
bottle
that
brags
of
imported
chocolate
im
not
sure
if
they
should
of
bothered
i
couldnt
tell
the
difference
since
the
chocolate
wasnt
a
very
strong
component
altogether
this
is
a
great
brew
and
is
a
dessert
in
itself
warning
if
you
dont
like
chocolate
dont
even
attempt
to
try
this
beer
d
this
is
a
really
good
stout
the
best
chocolate
stout
ive
ever
had
drinkability
its
a
stout
and
hence
not
easy
drinking
still
very
interesting
and
very
nice
on
a
cold
night
or
with
a
big
juicy
flavorful
steak
well
worth
a
try
i
poured
this
22
oz
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
nectar
that
leaves
a
milk
chocolate
head
hanging
off
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
nothing
but
choclolate
chocolate
chocolate
after
the
first
sip
there
is
rich
chocolate
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
after
another
sip
i
can
taste
the
rich
imported
chocolate
and
then
the
roasted
malts
come
in
the
beer
tends
to
finish
a
little
sweeter
than
the
initial
sip
i
recommend
this
brew
as
a
great
desert
beer
or
a
great
change
of
pace
beer
for
the
long
term
drinker
cheers
oelergud
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
big
chocolate
malt
head
decent
lacing
as
well
the
smell
is
of
fine
dark
chocolate
a
little
sweet
a
little
winey
a
little
malty
and
a
little
sour
with
that
undefineable
chocolate
aroma
as
well
taste
is
similar
not
hugely
malty
and
sweet
but
more
subtle
very
nice
chocolate
flavor
pure
and
rich
with
high
quality
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
quite
smooth
not
the
vreamiest
stout
out
there
but
a
little
tannic
bitterness
from
the
chocolate
helps
to
not
make
it
cloying
either
and
heightens
the
drinkability
the
good
quality
chocolate
in
this
beer
really
makes
a
difference
quite
nice
sipping
and
dark
thoughts
in
the
dead
of
winter
22oz
bottle
poured
very
dark
black
unable
to
see
my
fingers
through
the
glass
with
a
large
brown
head
that
left
lots
of
sticky
lacing
all
over
the
glass
smells
of
chocolate
are
pretty
dominating
lots
of
biter
sweet
chocolate
in
the
taste
with
an
equal
balance
of
cascade
hops
a
very
nice
blend
not
to
sweet
and
a
nice
bite
to
it
mouth
feel
is
very
rich
and
creamy
this
offering
from
rogue
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
one
my
favorite
chocolate
stouts
d
one
would
be
plenty
but
i
could
go
for
another
another
good
dark
brew
from
rogue
i
liked
the
mocha
and
now
the
chocolate
the
only
reason
the
chocolate
scored
lower
was
the
thinness
of
the
stout
i
hear
that
west
coast
stouts
are
thinner
either
way
it
is
still
good
next
stop
on
the
rogue
train
is
the
shakespeare
stout
pours
a
typical
stout
appearance
jet
black
with
a
thinmedium
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
some
lacing
you
can
tell
this
isnt
just
chocolate
malt
the
bottle
says
that
its
made
from
imported
chocolate
and
you
can
really
smell
and
taste
the
chocolate
the
chocolate
taste
is
very
noticeable
afterwards
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
is
detected
a
mediumbodied
stout
with
a
great
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
you
let
your
friends
try
just
so
that
they
can
taste
the
real
chocolate
pours
a
completely
opaque
black
color
with
a
tenacious
tan
head
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
aromas
of
dry
almost
dusty
chocolate
flavors
it
reminds
me
of
bakers
chocolate
there
is
a
milky
creamy
backing
to
the
aroma
maybe
due
to
the
oats
on
the
palate
some
stout
sourness
first
off
medium
carbonation
and
some
juicy
acidity
the
chocolate
flavor
is
quite
dry
not
sweet
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
short
overall
i
was
disappointed
by
this
the
chocolate
flavor
was
a
bit
flat
almost
subdued
and
theres
not
much
else
going
on
in
this
beer
to
make
up
for
it
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
the
staying
power
of
this
beer
is
kind
of
lacking
whats
a
mellifluous
term
for
enh
a
tasty
and
drinkable
stout
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
great
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
jet
black
with
a
nice
full
1
inch
dark
tan
head
that
left
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
dark
chocolate
with
a
slight
burnt
smell
in
the
background
the
taste
is
great
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
sweet
but
not
overdone
the
mouthfeel
is
full
just
the
way
a
stout
should
be
this
beer
is
high
drinkable
maybe
not
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
session
but
easily
an
enjoyable
beer
and
one
worth
beginning
a
session
with
the
only
downside
is
that
availability
is
poor
in
the
dallas
area
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
to
date
rich
fulfilling
and
complex
a
wonderful
winterdessert
beer
fantastic
pours
an
opaque
black
that
seems
to
have
brown
swirling
throughout
with
a
tan
head
that
is
pretty
large
to
begin
with
and
persists
while
drinking
smells
like
chocolate
bars
being
melted
to
make
hot
chocolate
tastes
like
chocolate
dark
chocolate
and
thats
almost
it
a
slight
hop
bitterness
keeps
things
fresh
tasting
nothing
exactly
balanced
here
but
thats
clearly
not
the
goal
where
other
chocolate
stouts
seek
to
add
chocolate
to
the
stout
experience
this
beer
merely
uses
the
stout
as
a
chocolate
delivery
device
mouthfeel
is
amazing
silky
smooth
and
very
thick
it
might
become
too
thick
after
more
than
one
bottle
but
for
one
serving
its
just
about
perfect
drinkability
is
impaired
only
by
the
chocolatey
nature
of
the
beer
and
that
it
is
so
rich
as
a
result
probably
wouldnt
go
to
the
well
to
often
with
this
but
slowly
sipping
two
glasses
is
very
enjoyable
very
good
beer
but
hard
to
compare
when
shakespeare
is
there
as
well
light
tan
head
drops
very
thin
giant
chocolate
in
nose
competely
black
through
and
through
its
like
drinking
a
dark
chocolate
bar
that
theres
so
much
chocolate
in
the
nose
and
taste
one
dimensional
as
a
beer
but
good
and
i
could
see
where
it
could
be
a
chocoholics
favorite
overall
a
tasty
chocolate
beer
must
be
in
the
mood
for
chocolate
though
just
1
bomber
will
do
very
nice
chocolate
aroma
a
beautiful
dark
black
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
nice
creamy
head
had
a
good
chocolate
taste
and
finished
like
bitter
dark
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
good
for
the
style
not
much
carbonation
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
day
every
day
great
beer
this
is
one
tasty
easy
to
drink
chocolate
however
i
had
to
take
a
point
away
for
mouth
feel
because
i
thought
it
was
a
little
thin
other
than
that
i
highly
recommend
it
d
this
trumps
youngs
its
not
something
id
drink
often
but
my
girlfriend
loves
it
this
beer
gets
me
laid
nuff
said
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
small
creamy
tan
slowly
diminishing
head
smells
of
rich
roasted
malt
with
lots
of
chocolate
some
dark
chocolate
in
there
but
its
the
good
dose
of
milk
chocolate
thats
most
notable
actually
yes
it
smells
a
little
like
chocolate
milk
in
a
good
way
accompanied
by
light
brown
sugar
and
grainy
bread
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
chocolate
presence
taking
center
stage
big
and
malty
with
being
overbearing
some
very
light
berry
in
there
too
the
finish
is
pleasantly
bitter
and
dry
and
improves
as
the
beers
warms
at
first
the
body
seems
huge
but
it
thins
a
bit
toward
the
finish
making
this
beer
big
and
satisfying
while
remaining
easydrinking
its
creamyturningdry
texture
and
mediumlow
carbonation
are
also
nice
not
a
bad
beer
overall
interesting
and
definitely
worth
trying
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
rogue
beers
a
superb
brew
by
rogue
this
thing
is
loaded
with
chocolate
the
22oz
makes
it
its
own
desert
or
if
you
like
its
own
meal
i
highly
recommend
this
one
really
very
tasty
nice
take
on
an
american
stout
but
i
think
ill
try
out
some
of
the
other
rogue
beers
before
going
back
to
this
one
i
can
see
me
drinking
this
once
in
a
while
but
probably
not
on
a
too
regular
basis
d
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
stout
ive
always
liked
youngs
doublechocolate
but
this
one
blows
it
out
of
the
water
this
is
how
a
chocolate
stout
should
taste
simple
chocolate
and
an
appropriate
modest
stout
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
really
a
delight
drinkability
for
the
style
this
is
drinkable
to
the
extreme
i
can
easily
have
a
few
pints
of
this
in
one
sitting
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
nice
two
finger
caramelcolored
head
that
dissipates
slowly
chocolate
is
evident
in
the
smell
as
it
is
in
the
taste
just
a
fantastic
experience
creamy
smooth
taste
and
the
feel
is
lighter
than
one
might
expect
not
dense
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
totally
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
due
to
the
sharper
coffee
notes
i
might
be
inclined
to
keep
it
limited
still
good
for
another
especially
suited
for
dessert
d
a
fine
porter
balanced
well
though
a
tad
on
the
bitter
side
its
got
chocolate
without
being
overbearing
a
very
nice
pint
to
enjoy
alone
or
with
dessert
the
rogue
chocolate
stout
float
is
a
dessert
drink
i
have
yet
to
try
but
plan
to
do
so
in
the
near
future
they
serve
them
at
rogue
and
at
pix
supposedly
invented
by
local
beer
writer
fred
eckhardt
i
think
i
was
anxious
to
try
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
expected
maybe
an
a
rather
than
the
expected
a
very
dark
inc
a
dark
tan
head
less
chocolate
more
vanilla
than
i
expected
good
mouthful
really
good
taste
rogue
chocolate
is
probably
one
of
my
top
510
stouts
id
also
recommend
trying
brooklyn
black
chocolate
stout
and
especially
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
the
mouth
is
mellow
and
creamy
on
the
front
and
the
dryness
of
the
malt
and
coco
followed
by
the
assertion
of
hops
results
in
a
delightfully
bittersweet
finish
a
truly
enjoyable
stout
a
wonderful
chocolate
stout
im
never
surprised
at
the
quality
brews
that
rogue
brews
this
stout
is
not
disgustingly
chocolatey
but
right
on
the
money
it
has
a
nice
mix
of
bitterness
and
buttery
sweetness
set
on
a
rich
roasted
malt
canvas
highly
recommended
the
tap
version
looked
just
as
good
but
the
chocolate
and
sweetness
were
far
more
prominent
than
in
the
bottled
version
to
the
point
of
being
a
little
overwhelming
and
seriously
detracting
from
drinkability
this
beer
poured
a
thick
oily
looking
liquid
with
a
nice
cream
colored
head
the
smell
is
sweet
like
a
mild
chocolate
the
taste
is
heavy
and
sweet
the
hops
are
noticeable
without
being
overbearing
the
chocolate
definitely
comes
through
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
chewy
i
love
this
beer
but
dont
think
that
it
is
something
you
can
have
several
of
in
one
sitting
other
an
outstanding
beer
unlike
some
other
stouts
out
there
this
beer
truly
tastes
of
chocolate
and
has
a
rich
full
flavor
overall
quite
impressive
very
drinkable
and
very
pleasant
sort
of
like
liquid
chocolate
would
probably
be
great
in
a
stout
float
in
the
end
rogue
makes
a
wonderful
chocolate
stout
its
one
of
the
better
ones
currently
on
the
market
cheers
this
beer
is
chocalety
like
no
other
chocolate
stout
ive
had
actually
uses
choclate
flavoring
so
no
great
surprise
it
pours
quite
dark
with
a
tawny
foam
big
foam
initially
as
in
my
cup
runneth
over
but
it
calmed
down
perhaps
the
oats
are
giving
it
foam
in
the
smell
and
taste
department
well
did
i
mention
chocolate
that
really
is
the
reason
to
drink
this
one
its
easy
to
forget
it
is
beer
the
hops
and
malt
take
a
back
seat
sweet
but
not
cloying
in
the
mouthfeel
department
it
sort
of
dries
my
mouth
out
after
each
swallow
leaving
a
powdery
feel
i
find
it
interesting
but
not
really
one
that
i
would
try
regularly
poured
from
a
22oz
silkscreened
bottle
and
split
with
a
friend
appearance
is
black
with
no
chance
of
light
penetrating
the
beer
thick
tan
head
that
maintains
itself
until
the
beer
is
gone
smell
is
dark
roasted
malt
with
a
load
of
dark
chocolate
some
coffee
hints
as
well
taste
is
heavenly
evenly
balanced
dark
malts
with
bitter
chocolate
combine
to
form
a
nearly
perfect
beer
coffee
and
blackened
malt
hints
creep
in
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
very
palateable
drinkability
is
also
way
up
there
i
could
have
glass
after
glass
of
this
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
d
this
is
fantastic
the
bitterness
and
burned
quality
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
youre
not
drinking
chocolate
milk
this
is
a
terrific
dessert
beer
this
is
believe
it
or
not
my
first
beer
from
rogue
ive
got
a
few
more
bombers
in
my
beer
cabinet
and
im
now
really
looking
forward
to
them
a
wonderful
introduction
to
the
brewery
im
hooked
served
from
a
bomber
pours
a
pure
black
with
no
light
passing
through
got
a
lot
of
head
out
of
a
normal
pour
kind
of
surprised
by
that
really
liked
the
dark
rich
look
of
the
beer
definitely
has
a
liquid
dark
chocolate
look
to
it
one
person
commented
that
it
looked
like
hot
chocolate
smell
is
pure
chocolate
taste
is
alcoholic
chocolate
milk
picked
it
because
we
were
having
smores
and
it
was
a
hit
mouthfeel
was
rich
and
oily
in
a
good
way
really
was
just
like
a
liquified
chocolate
bar
drinkability
is
lower
because
it
is
really
sweet
and
rich
split
the
bomber
between
four
people
and
it
was
a
good
amount
could
definitely
replace
dessert
after
a
meal
as
far
as
recommending
this
come
on
does
rogue
even
make
an
unimpressive
brew
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
buy
it
now
overall
this
is
a
very
good
chocolate
stout
with
stronger
emphasis
on
the
chocolate
than
other
versions
such
as
brooklyns
or
youngs
another
tasty
brew
from
rogue
taste
as
with
the
smell
the
chocolate
is
the
dominant
flavor
which
isnt
surprising
since
this
is
a
chocolate
stout
a
touch
of
coffee
bitterness
is
oresent
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
a
smokey
quality
this
isnt
to
complex
in
the
flaovr
department
but
it
is
still
very
good
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
and
fits
the
flavor
profile
almost
prefectly
the
only
thing
that
limits
the
drinkability
is
the
heaviness
of
the
beer
overall
i
was
afraid
this
beer
would
be
too
sweet
with
very
dominant
chocolate
flavors
but
the
roasted
bitterness
is
high
with
the
sweet
chocolate
providing
a
nice
balance
d
drinkable
another
great
brew
from
rogue
highly
recommend
very
dark
velvety
black
beer
with
a
dark
tan
barely
red
in
it
head
pours
out
thick
smells
hoppy
more
sweet
and
mild
than
a
hop
bomb
nothing
bad
just
not
too
remarkable
the
aftertaste
is
a
lot
like
semisweet
or
bitter
chocolate
morsels
up
front
it
is
a
lot
fruitier
and
hoppy
it
would
be
nicer
if
the
chocolate
could
come
out
more
at
the
front
thick
and
like
a
stout
should
be
i
could
drink
this
fine
and
its
not
a
bad
beer
maybe
its
just
how
i
feel
right
now
but
i
would
prefer
a
lot
of
beers
to
this
one
when
i
first
had
rogue
chocolate
stout
it
made
me
realize
theres
beer
out
there
to
be
explored
i
work
at
total
wine
beer
spirits
and
more
in
fort
myers
our
beer
section
is
considered
the
home
spot
when
i
started
there
is
february
of
this
year
i
noticed
a
full
case
24
loose
bottles
were
on
a
shelf
under
the
title
great
brews
i
figured
we
had
just
gotten
it
in
months
and
months
went
past
and
not
a
single
bottle
was
sold
but
still
i
thought
nothing
of
it
finally
in
late
august
i
decided
to
make
a
move
and
buy
the
first
bottle
off
the
shelf
it
turned
out
to
be
an
outstanding
rich
chocolate
stout
i
first
took
a
few
sips
directly
from
the
bottle
and
took
in
the
aroma
i
then
poured
the
rest
into
a
glass
and
noted
any
taste
or
smell
change
once
it
got
a
chance
to
breath
it
had
a
slightly
flat
taste
probably
from
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
so
long
it
was
a
dark
cocao
brown
strong
bittersweet
chocolate
flavor
filled
my
mouth
which
reminded
me
of
biting
into
a
hershey
bar
id
have
it
for
dessert
anytime
this
is
one
of
the
darkest
thickest
stouts
ive
had
to
date
this
pours
to
an
opaque
usedmotor
oil
black
with
a
thick
dark
tan
head
the
real
secret
to
enjoying
htis
beer
as
with
many
stouts
is
to
let
it
warm
some
in
my
anticipation
to
try
i
first
smelled
and
tasted
it
right
out
of
the
refrigerator
nothing
special
i
then
waited
20
minutes
and
what
a
difference
great
aroma
of
chocolate
and
toffee
smelled
like
fresh
made
turtle
candy
taste
was
more
of
the
malty
chocolate
but
finely
balanced
by
enough
hops
to
not
be
too
sweet
from
the
looks
and
smell
of
this
thick
bodied
beer
i
was
worried
about
a
syrupy
sweet
but
instead
was
long
smooth
and
just
right
a
very
good
beer
i
am
reviewing
this
about
34
of
the
way
through
this
bomber
ive
been
working
on
it
for
around
an
hour
just
enjoying
it
the
heavenly
smell
and
flavor
have
maintained
throughout
youre
only
going
to
want
one
of
these
but
youll
want
all
of
it
not
sure
about
dessert
but
this
is
a
great
nightcap
and
ill
happily
come
back
to
it
the
flavor
is
rich
malty
chocolateness
swimming
with
roasted
barley
and
some
hop
spice
little
sweet
but
a
damn
great
beer
all
i
have
to
say
is
wow
this
stuff
is
as
good
as
everyone
says
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
thick
tan
heads
that
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
when
smelling
it
fresh
out
of
the
bottle
you
definately
smell
the
malt
and
subtle
hints
of
dark
chocolate
the
taste
it
just
wonderful
to
me
very
balanced
the
malt
is
the
first
thing
i
notice
just
a
small
hint
of
alcohol
then
the
subtle
chocolate
flavor
the
chocolate
aftertaste
is
nice
and
not
overwhelming
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
not
nearly
as
heavy
as
you
would
expect
it
to
be
by
looking
at
it
very
good
drinkability
but
not
something
that
you
pound
4
of
unless
your
a
gorilla
or
something
i
usually
take
a
while
to
drink
my
stout
but
as
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
it
warmed
a
little
the
alcohol
taste
kind
of
started
to
take
over
and
there
was
less
of
a
chocolate
taste
at
that
point
but
i
pretty
much
enjoyed
the
whole
bottle
so
no
real
big
complaints
i
think
it
would
go
great
with
a
nice
chocolate
desert
or
it
can
be
desert
just
by
itself
i
highly
recommend
this
one
if
your
a
fan
of
stouts
tsome
sweet
chocolate
taste
then
leads
to
some
bittering
well
i
was
a
little
worried
this
was
going
to
just
taste
like
sam
adams
choclate
boch
but
let
me
tell
ya
the
taste
was
completely
differentin
a
good
way
made
from
real
chocolate
you
can
really
taste
it
almost
a
hot
chocolate
taste
and
mouthfeel
except
it
was
cold
and
and
alcohol
can
you
say
mmm
mmm
good
if
youre
a
fan
of
youngs
double
chocolate
this
is
a
must
have
first
off
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
heavenly
dark
chocolate
with
macadamia
nuts
and
pieces
of
orange
zest
come
to
mind
my
friend
who
doesnt
really
dig
beer
at
all
loved
the
smell
of
this
one
the
appearance
was
very
nice
with
fluffy
head
and
hardly
any
lacing
the
taste
was
great
chocolate
as
expected
with
a
little
bitterness
this
beer
is
basically
a
dessert
in
a
bottle
not
sure
if
id
drink
this
all
night
but
after
a
three
course
meal
this
would
be
perfect
pours
opaque
black
with
a
mediumsmall
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
strongly
just
like
milk
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
very
unique
and
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
lot
of
chocolate
obvious
and
pleasant
but
not
overpowering
some
hops
are
noticable
in
the
finish
and
the
beer
finishes
with
a
lingering
roasted
malt
bitterness
surprisingly
this
is
pretty
balanced
mouthfeel
is
excellent
thick
and
creamy
delicious
but
the
heaviness
and
chocolate
flavor
do
take
a
bit
away
from
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
awesome
overall
certainly
the
best
chocolate
stout
ive
had
cheers
overall
i
love
this
beer
from
start
to
finish
the
only
bad
thing
was
when
the
beer
was
gone
drinkability
is
just
not
up
to
standard
next
time
pour
me
something
else
mk
still
this
is
a
great
beer
by
far
the
best
chocolate
brew
ive
had
and
the
price
is
cheaper
than
most
of
the
others
too
drinkability
this
would
be
a
great
dessert
but
it
worked
well
as
a
midafternoon
snack
too
dry
finish
helps
drinkability
a
lot
i
went
back
to
the
bottle
to
look
for
a
freshness
date
but
none
was
to
be
found
i
have
to
wonder
if
this
is
either
stale
or
light
damaged
i
honestly
could
not
finish
the
entire
bottle
as
it
simply
was
not
appealing
to
me
in
the
least
im
going
to
try
a
another
bottle
from
a
different
state
and
rereview
if
there
is
a
significant
difference
otherwise
im
very
unimpressed
by
this
beer
a
great
starter
and
a
great
finisherall
qualities
i
love
in
a
beer
enjoy
alone
or
with
a
nice
after
dinner
light
to
medium
bodied
cigar
goes
incredibly
well
with
ny
cheesecake
as
well
im
sure
a
truffle
now
and
then
wouldnt
hurt
either
enjoy
recommended
the
beer
pours
very
very
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
by
far
the
primary
aroma
is
chocolate
but
i
can
smell
some
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
coffee
too
at
first
the
chocolate
sweetness
takes
over
and
then
finishes
bitter
theres
just
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
at
first
but
the
longer
i
drink
the
beer
the
stronger
the
aftertaste
gets
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
its
full
bodied
and
its
pretty
drinkable
i
dont
think
its
quite
as
good
as
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
but
the
rogue
chocolate
stout
is
still
a
pretty
good
beer
thick
and
rich
chewy
must
be
a
bazillion
calories
in
it
a
very
nice
sipper
indeed
this
is
one
to
get
again
and
share
with
friends
d
the
ale
is
very
drinkable
with
a
decent
hop
flavor
that
underscores
a
decadent
chocolate
taste
a
very
impressive
offering
from
rogue
and
one
that
i
definitely
recommend
poured
bomber
into
a
wheat
glass
pours
a
jet
black
in
color
with
a
2
inch
foamy
frothy
carmel
colored
head
very
impressive
looking
that
leaves
serious
lacing
on
glass
smell
is
of
bitter
sweet
chocolate
with
hints
of
coffee
thrown
in
there
taste
is
just
what
i
would
expect
a
chocolate
coffee
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
thrown
in
great
after
taste
of
strong
espresso
as
well
very
tasty
and
balanced
this
is
another
fine
drink
from
rogue
i
highly
recommend
this
to
any
chocolate
beer
lover
out
there
two
thumbs
way
up
on
this
fine
stout
overall
a
pretty
nicely
balanced
stout
with
that
bit
of
extra
malty
sweetness
from
the
chocolate
definitely
a
pleasent
experience
silky
looking
caramel
head
about
an
inch
high
covering
a
tenacious
looking
black
beer
smell
is
of
chocolate
malt
and
a
little
roasted
malt
perhaps
taste
is
almost
abundantly
chocolate
although
the
hops
do
come
through
albeit
just
enough
to
offset
the
sweet
maltiness
chocolate
is
strong
but
not
tedious
yet
more
than
enough
to
please
the
chocoholic
beer
lover
in
me
mouthfeel
is
a
luxurious
smooth
satin
delight
almost
a
romantic
affair
truly
a
sensual
stout
drinkability
is
slightly
better
than
average
as
i
could
maybe
have
a
couple
of
these
but
would
need
something
to
cut
through
the
sweetness
at
some
point
a
delicious
beer
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
overdo
it
drinkability
is
determined
if
you
love
chocolate
or
not
i
do
and
i
could
have
this
over
and
over
for
a
cheap
looking
bottle
this
was
a
suprise
of
a
drink
chocolate
lovers
get
your
fix
here
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
i
dont
know
why
anyone
would
pay
15
for
a
crock
of
impy
stout
when
chocolate
stout
and
shakespere
stout
are
available
for
14
of
the
price
cheers
awesomely
full
mouth
creamy
an
excellent
after
dinner
drink
i
highly
reccomend
psthe
low
appearance
rating
comes
from
the
heads
shortcomings
the
head
wasnt
that
impressive
and
i
didnt
get
any
lacing
i
feel
that
anyone
can
make
a
brew
a
beautifully
dark
as
this
its
the
head
thats
more
nuanced
this
is
a
good
stout
i
had
it
before
and
didnt
like
it
as
much
i
probably
had
it
too
cold
the
last
time
im
sure
this
would
go
very
well
with
most
rich
desserts
this
is
everything
i
was
expecting
and
more
it
poured
a
very
dark
rich
brown
and
left
a
thick
soapy
caramel
coloured
head
that
seems
to
be
hanging
around
for
sometime
laced
the
edges
of
the
glass
nicely
smells
like
milk
chocolate
i
mean
it
actually
smells
like
a
chocolate
easter
bunny
amazing
taste
is
good
and
chocolatey
as
well
but
there
is
almost
a
spiciness
present
like
a
nutmegcinnamonclove
kind
of
spiciness
bizarre
very
much
enjoyable
but
bizarre
nonetheless
has
a
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
which
is
a
bit
dry
as
well
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
little
or
no
carbonation
sting
this
is
a
fabulous
stout
im
glad
i
took
the
time
to
try
it
out
drinkability
good
for
a
long
winter
night
this
one
pours
a
black
with
a
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
you
can
pour
this
one
so
the
head
stays
with
you
for
the
entire
beer
i
find
that
this
gives
a
nice
aroma
to
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
pure
chocolate
sweet
and
inviting
it
is
like
melted
chocolate
in
a
glass
the
taste
is
similar
very
sweet
straight
chocolate
even
with
the
heavy
chocolate
taste
this
beer
is
balanced
so
you
do
not
get
sick
of
it
by
the
last
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
great
smooth
and
rich
i
always
find
that
i
could
have
a
couple
more
after
the
first
every
time
i
have
had
this
beer
it
has
always
impressed
me
an
excellent
brew
that
everyone
should
check
out
enjoy
this
was
a
totally
different
kind
of
beer
than
youngs
the
smell
is
of
sweet
powdery
chocolate
the
taste
is
of
liquified
sweet
chocolate
ibus
register
at
69
but
this
thing
actually
felt
like
maybe
10
this
one
is
pretty
mellow
this
would
be
the
beer
id
put
a
scoop
of
ice
cream
in
if
i
ever
wanted
a
beer
float
overall
i
enjoyed
this
stout
quite
a
bit
but
i
wouldnt
break
it
out
all
the
time
my
first
rogue
offering
this
is
a
tremendous
stout
i
know
some
people
arent
big
on
chocolate
or
coffee
stouts
but
to
heck
with
them
this
is
great
i
really
like
how
the
bittersweet
chocolate
adds
another
dimension
to
what
seems
like
it
would
be
a
worldclass
stout
underneath
definitely
an
easy
going

thissimply
stated

overall
my
impressions
of
this
beer
changed
significantly
over
time
this
beer
doesnt
impress
me
as
much
as
it
did
many
years
ago
however
it
is
still
a
good

this
again
but
not
in
the
warmer
months
of
the
year
very
good
beer
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
its
worth
buying
this
beer
for
the
smell
alone
great
for
dessert
im
not
even
a
huge
stout
fan
and
i
loved
this
beer
highly
recommended
eightyfive
degrees
with
high
humidity
was
not
the
place
for
this
beer
i
will
come
back
to
it
once
we
get
some
frost
in
the
air
d
easy
to
drink
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
this
stuff
is
so
sweet
but
i
did
drink
a
whole
22
oz
bottle
without
trouble
ill
probably
pick
up
another
one
of
these
days
luscious
head
is
dark
brown
like
the
foam
on
a
chocolate
milkshake
body
is
jet
black
like
a
basement
with
the
lights
off
spidery
lacing
is
left
all
the
way
down
the
nose
is
like
ripping
the
lid
off
a
packet
of
instant
hot
chocolate
very
inviting
taste
is
big
bitter
chocolate
roasty
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweetsour
mouth
is
nice
and
even
all
i
can
say
is
if
you
want
chocolate
this
is
your
beer
wonderful
if
you
like
chocolate
you
oughta
love
this
stuff
if
you
dont
you
youre
wierd
the
pour
is
dark
dark
brown
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
milk
chocolate
fills
the
nose
like
chocolate
milk
burnt
and
roasted
malts
join
the
chocolate
in
the
taste
to
remind
you
that
youre
drinking
a
stout
if
you
let
the
beer
sit
on
your
tounge
for
a
moment
it
becomes
velvety
smooth
and
soooo
creamy
another
plus
is
that
this
is
the
only
sweet
stout
ive
had
that
doesnt
become
sickeningly
rich
by
the
end
this
ones
totally
worth
rogues
high
price
pours
a
dark

with
a
nice
creamy

finger

and
a
slight

taste
is
creamy
chocolate
up
front
with
notes
of
coffee
and
hops
finishing
up
the
taste
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
may
be
a
bit
too
strong
for
this
particular
brew
but
they
do
help
clean
the
palate
of
the
sweetness
preparing
you
for
the
next
sip
this
brew
from
rogue
is
an
absolute
first
class
beer
one
of
the
best
and
a
treat
to
drink
d
mmm
goes
down
easy
and
makes
me
want
more
overall
impression
a
great
stout
for
the
month
of
february
when
your
sick
of
the
cold
huge
chocolate
flavor
and
clean
fermented
this
beer
is
made
with
imported
chocolate
i
loved
it
if
you
like
stouts
you
have
to
try
this
one
edit
had
to
add
this
just
made
an
ice
cream
float
with
this
beer
and
some
vanilla
ice
cream
and
it
is
awesome
d
tremendous
for
beer
lovers
and
those
that
claim
that
they
dont
like
beer
delicious
i
dont
think
ive
tried
a
rogue
that
ive
disliked
so
far
but
this
was
excellent
im
dreaming
of
a
trip
to
oregon
very
enjoyable
beer
all
around
though
i
prefer
the
shakepeare
stout
ill
definitely
go
back
to
the
chocolate
in
the
future
you
get
the
idea
cheers
drinkability
i
liked
it
so
much
i
had
another
for
a
fullflavored
stout
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
and
the
6
abv
wont
hit
you
as
hard
as
say
an
imperial
stout
but
if
youre
not
into
chocolateflavored
beer
you
may
consider
this
to
be
a
one
and
done
desserttype
beer
appears
near
pitch
black
with
a
fair
tan
head
smells
great
mainly
and
very
strongly
of
dark
chocolate
the
taste
is
heavy
with
roasted
grains
and
a
distinct
chocolate
aftertaste
after
a
few
drinks
the
chocolate
aftertaste
became
less
pronounced
and
was
slightly
more
bitter
though
i
would
not
have
described
the
first
few
sips
as
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
heavy
on
the
bubbles
and
i
would
say
it
was
a
little
too
much
for
a
stout
but
there
was
some
creaminess
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
but
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
like
this
i
usually
go
for
something
a
bit
stronger
and
more
complex
edit
just
read
cwrws
review
and
creamy
lactose
is
an
absolutely
perfect
phrase
for
this
beer
overhopped
from
my
perspective
a
flaw
in
some
stone
brews
i
cant
help
but
feel
it
would
soar
if
toned
down
just
a
bit
even
after
several
tries
the
unpleasant
bitterness
lingers
to
make
the
drinkability
rating
mediocre
ive
enjoyed
barleywines
that
didnt
suffer
from
this
limitation
maybe
its
just
me
and
my
sweetlonging
palatal
proclivity
decent
numbers
allaround
otherwise
ill
give
this
contender
a
few
more
gos
at
it
before
giving
up
you
never
know
this
is
my
first
chance
to
try
the
chocolate
stout
from
rogue
and
if
reviews
mean
anything
this
should
be
a
fine
stout
indeed
650ml
bottle
with
the
embossed
rogue
label
what
i
love
about
the
rogue
bottles
is
their
listing
of
the
actual
hops
and
malts
used
in
the
beersomething
i
have
yet
to
see
on
any
bottle
here
in
canada
nice
to
have
the
ibu
and
plato
listed
as
well
big
whiff
of
chocolate
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
this
like
their
mocha
porter
is
extremely
dark
and
opaque
with
hints
of
dark
blue
near
the
edges
the
head
is
large
and
mochacoloured
with

a
syrupy
aroma
floats
around
too
akin
to

maple
the
hops
are
really
hard
to
smell
because
this
is
all
about

the

is

it
is

cake
chocolate

etc
anything
chocolate
really
to
its
credit
it
smells
like
fresh
real
chocolate
and
not
some
stale
extract
the
beer
warms
a
little
and
some
creamy
lactose
comes
into
play
as
well
complementing
the
malts
a
really
lovely
malty
aroma

in
all

and
sweet
cocoa
and
mocha

the
tongue
at
first
with
soft
hints
of
dusty
chocolate
on
the
middle
and
a
fairly
bitter
finish
where
the
hops
add
their
oiliness
and
a
little
grassy
citrus
the
bitterness
is
actually
quite
high
after
a
few
sips

malts
with
some
oat
fulness
licorice

raisins
and
very
grainy
and
dusty
malting
in
the
aftertaste
still
the
flavour
is
not
quite
as
full

as
chocolatefilled
as
i
expected
the
body
feels
a
little
weakperhaps
less
smooth
than
i
should
like
for
a
chocolate
stout
lingering
taste
though
with
a
wonderful
roasty
dryness
this
was
very
good
but
not
outstanding
personally
i
dont
see
why
it
rates
so
high
a
definite
case
of
notlivinguptothehype
would
be
best
imo
on
a
colder
day
but
it
was

on
the
shelf
and
i
wanted
to
give
it
a
go
i
was
pleased

slowly
settles
to
a
skim

leaving
a
single

of

at

the
smell
is
thick
and
inviting
filled
with
roastiness
and
a

aroma
similar
to
a
warm
brownie

hersheys

the
taste
is
roasty

that
gives
way
to
clear
as

slightly
bittersweet

chocolate
but
with
a
touch
of

sweetness
there
is
a
creamy
creaminess

as
well
the
roast
chocolate
notes
linger
in
the
mouth
full
bodied
and
also
surprisingly
light
with
almost
no
carbonation
but
this
works
perhaps
not
a
session
beer
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
and
is
a
wonderful
accompaniment
with
rich
desserts
i
must
say
that
this
is
the
rogue
brew
that
i
wanted
to
try
the
most
i
cant
say
that
it
is
a
bad
beer
but
i
am
a
little
disappointed
i
was
hoping
for
something
closer
to
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
as
that
is
one
of
my
personal
favorites
a
good
stout
but
the
chocolate
is
drowned
out
by
the
strong
stout
qualities
damn
good
beer
i
love
it
i
need
more
i
have
tried
other
chocolate
stouts
to
date
none
have
been
in
the
same
league
as
this
one
by
rogue
well
done
overall
wow
a
kickass
porter
i
think
im
in
love
dark
black
pour
leaves
tan
crust
of
foam
aroma
is
distinctively
sweet
and
of
chocolate
cake
the
taste
is
not
as
sweet
perhaps
it
has
a
bit
of
mocha
flavor
with
a
hint
of
smoke
and
a
moderately
bitter
finish
that
has
a
sour
after
taste
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
with
decent
carbonation
drinkabilty
is
good
not
overly
alcoholic
but
the
chocolate
flavor
seemed
a
bit
contrived
as
they
added
flavoring
i
would
have
expected
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
taste
overall
definately
worth
trying
the
chocolate
flavor
is
good
though
it
did
come
off
a
little
onedimensional
nonetheless
highly
drinkable
notes
this
one
is
aboslutely
great
a
chocolate
lovers
dream

foam

cheers
this
is
a
chocolate
lovers
chocolate
stout
it
is
a
beautiful
beer
black
with
a
creamy
slightly
brown
head
that
just
invited
the
lucky
drinker
to
imbibe
the
taste
is
sweet
for
a
beer
with
an
overwhelming
chocolate
taste
it
is
almost
like
drinking
dark
chocolate
with
a
nice
hop
undertone
playing
with
the
semisweet
roastiness
of
the
malt
a
little
slow
going
down
due
to
its
body
this
is
a
very
nice
offering
from
rogue
poured
near
black
with
a
two
inch
mocha
head
smell
is
chocolate
chocolate
chocolate
and
even
more
chocolate
oddly
enough
taste
is
chocolate
too
both
sweet
and
bitter
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
coating
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
rich
malty
sweet
beauty
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
and
thick
lacing
the
color
is
completely
opaque
the
aromas
of
chocolate
and
mocha
are
completely
apparent
from
the
opening
of
the
bottle
there
are
more
subtle
notes
of
toasty
or
roasted
grain
but
not
overpowering
i
think
rogue
has
once
again
proven
to
me
that
they
can
brew
whatever
they
want
and
succeed
i
could
drink
this
beer
for
dessert
any
day
of
the
week
i
really
want
to
hate
this
beer
because
of
who
makes
it
but
i
cant
do
that
this
is
really
a
great
beer
creamy
and
tasty
this
is
quite
good
and
somewhat
expensive
at
7
a
bottle
if
you
are
holding
out
on
trying
this
just
because
of
who
makes
it
then
stop
and
give
it
a
chance
i
would
possibly
question
the
style
classification
as
this
is
most
certainly
a
heavily
spiced
beer
pours
a
thick
ceamy
head
and
then
disapates
quickly
this
beer
is
heavily
carbonated
with
a
strong
scent
of
chocolate
and
malt
not
as
strong
or
smooth
as
i
hoped
considering
shakespears
taste
i
even
tried
to
pare
with
chocolate
and
found
it
very
dissapointing
this
beer
had
no
substance
to
it
and
left
me
hanging
hope
next
years
batch
is
better
this
beer
leaves
a
very
tannic
mouthfeel
with
a
long
choclate
finish
too
choaclaty
for
my
liking
making
this
a
one
beer
and
done
for
me
smells
faintly
of
chocolate
and
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
milky
brownish
head
initial
taste
is
a
bit
harsh
complex
combination
of
quite
bitter
chocolate
and
hops
following
the
beer
is
a
great
mouthfeel
something
like
chocolate
cake
perfect
drink
for
after
dinner
with
a
desert
or
as
a
desert
note
the
ratings
i
gave
reflect
what
i
think
the
beer
deserves
and
i
will
review
it
again
soon
and
adjust
as
i
see
fit
thanks
s
o
overall
the
word
of
mouth
has
been
spreading
and
with
good
reason
this
beer
kicks
ass
it
takes
a
backseat
to
no
chocolate
stout
im
looking
at
you
brooklyn
you
have
been
matched
the
22
oz
size
gives
you
plenty
of
time
to
savor
all
this
beer
has
to
offer
im
glad
i
bought
two
instead
of
just
one
rogue
why
must
you
be
all
the
way
on
the
west
coast
as
much
as
i
like
this
beer
though
ive
opened
two
22oz
bottles
on
seperate
occasions
and
couldnt
finish
either
of
them
afterwhile
it
just
gets
to
be
too
much
for
me
pours
quite
dark
just
about
opaque
big
dark
tan
head
leaves
nice
tracings
on
the
glass
it
took
me
a
while
to
begin
drinking
this
beer
because
i
was
having
so
much
fun
just
smelling
it
rich
milk
chocolate
faint
pipe
tobacco
all
wrapped
up
in
a
general
candy
aroma
smells
like
chocolate
eggs
with
the
hard
candy
shell
smells
like
easter
more
goodness
on
the
palate
surprisingly
airy
and
floral
followed
by
a
candy
sweetness
chocolate
tobacco
then
a
sturdy
roasted
bitterness
in
the
finish
whereas
the
aroma
seems
to
be
all
milk
chocolate
the
flavor
takes
on
more
of
a
dark
chocolatecocoa
profile
along
with
dark
fruits
as
are
often
found
in
dark
chocolate
in
this
case
dark
cherries
perhaps
whereas
this
baby
is
loaded
with
flavor
the
palate
remains
by
and
large
unsmothered
and
as
such
you
may
be
tempted
to
gulp
this
brew
right
down
but
dont
theres
too
much
complexity
and
too
many
rewards
in
here
to
rush
through
bravo
rogue
poured
a
very
deep
brown
color
with
massive
tannish
head
left
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
taste
is
loaded
with
toasted
malt
but
the
dark
chocolate
is
also
present
in
large
quantities
taste
is
sensational
with
the
sweet
choclate
tastes
combining
with
the
roasted
malt
to
form
an
astonishins
delicious
taste
sensation
finishes
with
a
slight
bitterness
but
the
sweetness
of
the
chocolate
overwelms
it
an
excellent
wellmade
beer
i
recommend
it
and
i
will
be
definitely
be
having
it
again
there
is
no
reason
not
to
have
another
an
excellent
brew
the
beer
pours
dark
rich
as
you
might
expect
little
to
no
head
to
speak
of
decent
aroma
with
the
foreshadowing
of
chocolate
syrup
to
follow
decent
but
thin
mouthfeel
with
an
abundance
of
chocolate
overtones
and
a
malty
body
everything
about
this
is
hinted
with
that
chocolate
syrup
taste
overtones
body
nose
finish
aftertaste
you
name
it
its
there
after
i
finished
the
glass
and
licked
my
fingers
it
tasted
like
chocolate
this
could
easily
be
a
gateway
beer
for
chocolate
lovers
a
truly
wonderful
stout
that
is
just
beautifully
crafted
and
will
consistently
bring
a
smile
to
your
face
with
each
sip
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
from
a
22
ounce
brown
bottle
malt
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
nose
tastes
like
a
dark
chocolate
bar
i
like
beers
that
have
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
them
this
may
be
more
than
i
prefer
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
by
any
measure
i
like
the
concept
of
a
chocolate
stout
but
i
found
it
to
be
more
of
a
super
dark
chocolate
malt
taste
than
candy
bar
sort
of
chocolate
its
good
but
i
just
didnt
think
it
was
well
balanced
d
good
drinkability
very
enjoyable
as
a
nightcap
i
think
the
prevailing
word
that
sums
up
this
beer
is
smooth
this
is
an
exceptional
chocolate
stout
pours
jetblack
with
a
thin
lacy
head
smell
is
just
wondrous
very
heavy
dark
chocolate
i
was
a
little
bit
worried
when
i
saw
added
chocolate
flavoring
on
the
label
but
the
smoothness
of
this
brew
is
overwhelming
very
very
nice
a
very
good
beer
but
almost
a
bit
too
intense
on
its
own
paired
with
a
dessert
however
amazing
recommended
drinkability
i
myself
rate
this
verry
high
and
if
you
are
a
fan
of
this
genre
you
proaly
will
too
but
if
not
you
may
find
it
to
ba
a
bit
to
sweet
pours
jet
black
and
completely
opaque
with
a
fairly
dark
brown
head
that
dissipates
reasonably
slowly
and
leaves
a
thick
ring
and
good
lacing
smell
is
laced
with
thick
sweet
chocolate
and
has
a
slightly
burnt
overtone
the
smell
just
gets
stronger
and
sweeter
as
the
beer
warms
until
it
is
like
a
freshly
unwrapped
chocolate
bar
the
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
plenty
of
chocolate
coming
through
again
the
chocolate
becomes
more
palpable
as
the
beer
warms
up
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
thin
but
still
has
enough
body
to
satisfy
and
the
drinkability
is
remarkable
for
a
stout
this
goes
down
easier
than
the
macro
lager
i
was
given
at
a
party
last
night
nearly
perfect
this
is
destined
to
be
an
alltime
favourite
very
nice
not
something
to
drink
more
than
one
of
but
would
be
great
to
go
along
with
desert
or
as
desert
itself
dark
chocolatey
brown
with
a
nice
finger
of
tightlypacked
teddy
bear
brown
head
definite
chocolate
more
so
than
any
other
beer
even
youngs
in
my
opinion
kind
of
dark
chocolate
but
also
some
baking
chocolate
and
maybe
some
chocolate
syrup
roasted

nice
lightly
sweet

roasted

not

almost

ample

yum
this
is
an
awesome

stout
nice
dark
almost

thin
chocolate
head
smells
and
tastes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
creamy
taste
and
mouth
feel
nice
smooth
finish
heavy
enough
that
you
are
satisfied
and
settled
after
one
relaxing
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
a
chocolate
lovers
delight
such
nice
natural
chocolate
smells
and
tastes
very
drinkable
not
at
all
to
thick
or
rich
rogues
chocolate
stout
pours
black
as
night
with
a
one
finger
brown
head
in
a
pint
glass
really
no
lacing
looks
slick
smells
like
dry
bittersweet
cocoa
tastes
more
so
creamy
full
bodied
feel
dry
in
the
finish
very
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
cheers
to
a
delicious
natural
chocolate
beer
drinkability
also
ranks
high
due
to
low
alcohol
and
smooth
well
blended
flavors
if
only
the
aroma
had
more
closely
resembled
the
flavor
this
would
have
been
a
considerably
better
beer
very
sweet
chocolatey
and
drinkable
d
extremely
tasty
brew
get
a
bomber
of
this
and
try
it
the
only
reason
i
knock
off
points
for
drinkability
is
because
i
think
eventually
i
would
get
tired
of
the
chocolate
flavor
and
the
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
would
prohibit
extended
drinking
sessions
an
interesting
idea
with
this
beer
is
to
have
it
with
some
very
bitter
chocolate
i
had
it
with
a
couple
of
pieces
of
85
cocoa
lindt
and
it
was
fantastic
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
bitter
which
i
am
impenetrable
black
with
a
massive
creamedcoffee
froth
smooth
and
undulating
sweet
cocoa
aromas
predominate
but
subtly
over
a
roasted
dark
malt
presence
there
is
an
underlying
and
unexpected
bitterness
perceived
most
strongly
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
that
pervades
the
roasted
coffee
malt
flavors
and
chocolate
sweetness
i
want
to
say
this
peculiar
bitterness
comes
from
the
cocoa
but
subsequent
burps
yield
a
distinct
cascade
flavor
amazing
complexity
of
tastes
acheived
here
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
body
not
something
id
go
for
very
frequently
mainly
because
of
the
special
chocolate
flavor
that
is
the
main
event
of
this
beer
but
nevertheless
an
formidable
and
worthy
accomplishment
by
the
geniuses
at
rogue
drinkability
truffly
goodness
make
this
a
great
specialoccasion
beer
pair
it
with
a
raspberry
torte
and
youre
all
set
pours
a
jet
black
color
with
a
minimal
finely
textured
tan
head
aroma
of
chocolate
cocoa
with
a
light
hoppiness
very
thick
and
creamy
looking
which
follows
onto
the
palate
as
well
lush
body
coats
the
tongue
with
a
pleasant
not
overbearing
chocolate
flavor
slight
hints
of
toasted
malt
lend
a
smoky
burnt
overtone
to
the
flavor
not
overly
sweet
with
a
fairly
dry
finish
a
very
nice
brew
to
relax
and
sip
id
definitely
buy
this
one
again
possibly
a
bad
choice
for
my
first
rogue
but
ill
still
go
for
another
at
some
point
i
hear
dead
guy
is
great
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
i
do
not
have
access
to
many
chocolate
stouts
in
my
area
but
i
think
this
rogue
is
great
i
will
definately
buy
this
one
again
and
again
and
again
i
will
probably
enjoy
this
after
a
meal
since
i
like
sweets
after
i
eat
i
can
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
an
after
dinner
beer
and
sweet
desert
definitely
recommended
bad
artwork
aside
drinkability
good
but
after
a
while
the
sweet
flavors
get
to
be
too
much
would
be
great
on
tap
in
a
single
serving
or
splitting
the
220z
with
a
friend
if
u
like
chocolate
stouts
this
is
a
must
everyone
should
try
this
one
at
least
once
overall
i
love
this
beer
and
buy
it
every
chance
i
get
is
it
better
ontap
or
from
the
bottle
hmm
gonna
need
some
more
experimentation
to
find
out
cheers
to
rogue
this
is
a
fabulous
beer
ontap
and
out
of
the
bottle
i
have
had
both
but
this
review
is
for
the
tap
ill
get
around
to
writing
a
bottle
review
when
i
drink
it
next
time
i
cant
wait
to
try
a
black
and
tan
made
with
rogue
choc
stout
and
rogue
juniper
pale
ale
i
think
it
would
be
fab
surprisingly
bitter
taste
malty
sweet
followed
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
of
pine
and
citrus
chocolate
in
the
taste
is
more
bitter
than
sugary
a
touch
more
sweetness
in
the
flavor
would
make
this
one
more
balanced
the
appearance
and
the
aroma
are
topnotch
though
i
had
a
pint
of
this
while
visiting
kclingers
the
beer
comes
in
a
pint
glas
and
there
is
a
thin
creamy
tan
head
floating
on
the
surface
the
color
of
the
beer
is
drak
brown
with
no
lite
passing
through
when
held
up
the
aroma
is
rich
and
chocolatey
no
surprise
there
the
chocolate
is
actually
fairly
sweet
like
cocoa
powder
of
a
hershey
bar
first
sip
reveals
a
fairly
thick
body
and
very
mild
carbonation
nice
and
smooth
beer
then
the
flavor
things
go
down
a
little
here
imo
the
beer
is
very
sweet
chocolate
flavored
like
eating
a
candy
bar
over
and
over
by
about
mid
pint
it
gets
to
be
very
cloying
and
not
very
enjoyable
maybe
with
some
fruit
or
vanilla
ice
cream
but
with
a
dinner
it
is
just
too
much
sweet
chocolate
of
course
if
you
really
dig
that
this
is
for
you
i
am
turned
off
by
the
overdose
of
chocolate
and
wish
it
was
some
more
roasted
notes
or
coffee
to
balance
the
sweetness
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
very
nice
cool
weather
beer
went
well
with
a
hearty
beef
stew
and
very
nice
after
dinner
very
good
stuff
my
100th
beer
review
no
disappointments
from
this
beer
it
defiantly
lives
up
to
its
name
the
pour
looked
great
dark
and
rich
with
the
head
being
a
dark
brown
the
smell
was
great
it
was
like
you
had
just
taken
a
chocolate
cake
out
of
the
oven
the
chocolate
was
there
but
you
could
still
get
a
whiff
of
the
good
stout
flavor
it
was
very
smooth
good
flavor
kind
of
reminds
me
of
chocolate
milk
dabsolutely
wonderful
the
bittersweet
chocolate
flavors
make
this
one
great
any
more
sweetness
would
ruin
it
outstanding
couldnt
drink
more
than
this
bottle
though
it
is
incredibly
thick
a
great
dessert
brew
beers
like
this
keep
rogue
at
the
top
of
the
list
of
american
breweries
still
though
this
is
a
darned
good
stout
low
carbonation
pleasant
dark
chocolate
aftertaste
a
wonderful
pairing
of
the
stout
and
the
chocolate
with
neither
overpowering
the
other
one
of
the
few
beers
here
i
feel
is
truly
underrated
insanely
easy
to
drink
has
been
a
favorite
for
many
years
im
glad
i
finally
found
a
place
to
get
it
regularly
the
taste
can
only
be
described
one
way
chocolate
followed
by
a
mild
and
nicely
added
bitterness
that
is
a
combination
of
malts
and
hops
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
biscuit
and
bread
in
there
as
well
overall
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
drink
and
very
well
made
poured
an
opaque
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
from
a
22oz
bomber
that
fell
quickly
to
light
foamy
off
white
lacing
aroma
is
rich
of
many
types
of
chocolate
mainly
a
bittersweetbakers
chocolate
and
some
roasted
malt
also
present
smells
very
good
nice
blend
of
sweet
and
bitter
chocolate
taste
is
powerful
chocolate
and
malt
hints
of
hazelnut
and
berries
doesnt
deliver
as
well
as
the
aroma
implies
but
still
very
good
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
moderate
to
heavy
carbonation
maybe
a
little
too
carbonated
drinkability
good
pretty
rich
tasting
brew
would
be
an
excellent
dessert
pairing
for
complementing
something
sweet
with
the
faint
chocolate
bitter
aftertaste
from
this
impressive
beer
would
purchase
again
my
wife
has
some
interest
in
this
beer
as
well
dtoo
intense
for
heavy
drinking
but
great
beer
note
if
you
dont
like
the
smell
or
taste
of
chocolate
you
most
likely
not
enjoy
this
great
brew
taste
was
ok
but
not
as
outstanding
as
the
visual
tasted
a
little
light
not
as
chocolatey
as
expected
kind
of
similar
to
rogue
mocha
porter
for
me
in
that
i
expected
more
based
on
the
name
and
previous
reviews
rogue
continues
to
impress
me
definitely
a
beer
to
try
d
im
not
a
big
chocolate
fan
but
i
do
really
like
this
beer
as
always
another
very
solid
offering
by
rogue
not
something
that
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
at
once
i
dont
think
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
snowy
night
by
the
fire
to
help
warm
you
up
a
little
this
is
an
awesome
stout
this
is
a
tasty
adult
treat
like
chocolate
milk
was
when
i
was
a
kid
i
highly
recommend
it
mmm
i
want
another
however
if
you
like
me
relish
a
good
dark
bar
of
chocolate
lindts
70
for
example
then
watch
out
this
beer
will
be
the
death
of
both
your
waistline
and
your
wallet
dont
say
i
didnt
warn
you
very
black
with
one
of
the
darkest
most
beautiful
heads
i
have
seen
on
a
beer
creamy
with
a
few
different
shades
of
brown
and
tight
lacing
the
aroma
is
so
alive
chocolate
bready
malt
in
the
front
with
raw
leafy
unroasted
coffee
beans
backing
it
up
mouthwatering
taste
is
largely
lukecold
coffee
and
cocoaish
chocolate
with
a
very
strongly
herbal
lasting
finish
thin
feel
is
not
slick
but
smooth
almost
casklike
as
it
warms
very
very
drinkable
one
of
the
if
not
the
best
beer
at
this
alcohol
percentage
i
slightly
prefer
the
shakespeare
but
hell
why
choose
when
you
can
have
both
wonderful
the
roasting
affect
and
bitter
chocolate
leave
a
nice
lingering
after
taste
if
you
like
chocolate
this
is
the
one
for
you
a
nice
one
off
for
me
drinkabilityi
could
drink
this
for
a
night
alcohol
is
not
pumped
up
and
it
goes
down
so
very
easily
desert
in
a
bottle
this
would
be
paired
excellently
with
just
about
any
desert
on
the
planet
friscos
plans
on
adding
it
to
whipped
cream
frambroise
reduction
and
vanilla
ice
cream
yum
notes
i
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
and
while
it
was
good
i
was
expecting
a
more
pronounced
chocolate
than
a
bitter
malt
if
you
like
bitter
stouts
then
please
pick
this
up
this
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
substantial
cafe
au
lait
head
it
had
a
sweet
chocolate
odor
the
taste
was
a
little
offputting
it
was
very
sweet
almost
too
sweet
for
me
and
had
a
pronounced
chocolate
taste
it
felt
very
carbonated
in
my
mouth
and
wasnt
as
substantial
as
i
expected
pours
pitch
black
12
inch
of
head
beginning
with
and
shrinks
to
thin
head
and
already
with
lacing
down
the
glass
and
has
nice
streaks
and
blobs
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
smells
of
chocolate
dark
and
malty
simply
lovely
though
a
bit
too
understated
which
is
about
the
only
complaint
i
have
for
this
beer
taste
is
heavenly
have
i
had
a
better
chocolate
stout
perhaps
but
this
is
up
there
and
as
it
warms
i
only
become
more
impressed
the
great
thing
is
the
chocolate
taste
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
taste
nor
visa
versa
that
is
the
chocalate
and
malts
are
balance
each
other
almost
perfectly
as
far
as
mouthfeel
goes
its
interesting
because
it
gives
you
a
little
phiz
in
the
beginning
is
smooth
through
the
middle
then
gives
you
some
tingle
during
the
aftertaste
with
choclaty
goodness
to
leave
you
wanting
more
this
might
be
the
highest
beer
rating
ive
given
because
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
d
goes
down
smooth
tastes
great
easy
on
the
bankroll
get
some
rogue
please
put
this
stuff
in
a
6pack
pretty
drinkable
no
alcohol
prescence
tasty
and
thick
a
satisfying
stout
overall
has
a
nice
flavor
profilethe
chocolate
is
matched
well
against
hop
bitterness
to
be
honest
i
expected
more
of
chocolate
flavor
however
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
and
the
hop
bitterness
made
this
a
quality
brew
nice
brew
for
the
cold
weather
also
pours
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
small
tan
head
this
might
come
as
a
shock
but
this
beer
actually
smells
like
real
chocolate
if
you
blindfolded
me
and
put
the
beer
and
a
chocolate
bar
in
front
me
i
would
be
hardpressed
to
tell
which
one
was
which
the
taste
is
great
as
well
but
i
did
not
receive
the
chocolate
rush
that
i
did
from
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
slightly
bitter
from
the
use
of
hops
brings
the
drinkabikity
down
a
bit
but
its
still
great
for
a
stout
this
beer
was
a
treat
to
have
on
tap
and
left
me
feeling
very
satisfied
as
a
chocolate
lover
i
find
the
chocolate
component
of
this
beer
to
be
extremely
wellexecuted
it
is
definately
a
major
presence
but
complements
the
other
flavors
without
downing
them
out
the
hop
level
is
similarly
welldonecontributing
to
aroma
and
flavor
without
throwing
things
out
of
balance
overall
this
a
complex
and
wellcrafted
stout
suitable
for
dessert
or
simply
good
drinking
overall
this
beer
is
delicious
smells
amazing
and
is
very
well
made
but
seems
to
fall
just
short
of
true
stout
greatness
for
me
still
definitely
worth
a
3
99
flier
every
once
in
a
while
in
the
winter
do
you
like
chocolate
if
so
this
is
a
great
beer
it
does
not
have
the
usual
overdone
flavors
just
a
wonderfully
balanced
brew
if
youre
expecting
a
dry
stout
this
will
be
quite
distracting
go
with
cocoa
flow
and
enjoy
this
beer
works
well
by
itself
or
paired
with
a
number
of
desserts
yum
one
of
the
better
rouge
beers
in
my
opinion
this
stout
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
thick
and
rich
a
brown
head
with
even
carbonation
the
smell
is
a
very
light
hint
of
chocolate
a
very
stout
taste
with
chocolate
overtones
and
even
more
chocolaty
aftertaste

nice
its
has
a
light
mouth
feel
for
a
stout
this
is
a
very
nice
chocolate
stout
overall
an
ok
stout
that
i
draink
with
apathy
i
cant
really
recommend
it
but
its
worth
a
try
for
stout
fans
beer
and
chocolate
what
could
be
better
together
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
meduim
bodied
the
beer
is
not
as
chewy
in
the
mouth
as
some
other
stouts
however
this
is
still
a
dam
fine
beer
a
very
flavorful
version
of
the
style
unique
yet
still
true
to
the
style
i
dont
see
myself
getting
tired
of
this
one
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
pretty
heavy
but
its
delicious
flavor
makes
it
smooth
drinkability
is
excellent
only
drawback
is
its
price
but
its
worth
the
luxury
once
in
a
while
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
winter
season
this
beer
pours
black
and
thick
it
almost
looks
syrupy
as
it
cuts
through
the
one
finger
head
the
head
is
brownish
tan
in
color
and
provides
good
lacing
the
lacing
continued
to
stick
for
the
entire
beer
which
surprised
me
aroma
is
clearly
chocolate
just
like
a
bag
of
hersheys
cocoa
powder
the
malts
are
also
a
little
toasty
smelling
but
mostly
hidden
by
the
sweet
smell
of
chocolate
taste
is
outstanding
and
actually
has
good
balance
between
the
sweet
chocolate
malts
and
hops
which
became
more
noticeable
as
i
drank
the
beer
hops
have
a
grassy
quality
creamy
but
finishes
a
little
dry
and
surprisingly
crisp
one
word
can
sum
this
one
up
wow
this
brew
pours
a
dark
nearly
black
color
with
a
dense
tan
head
of
moderate
height
decent
lace
coupled
with
the
visual
perception
of
thick
heaviness
and
serious
viscosity
make
this
an
attractive
one
this
is
another
one
of
those
beers
that
deserves
lots
of
nose
attention
bigtime
chocolate
malt
deeply
roasted
grain
oats
dark
coffee
its
a
little
grainy
at
the
start
and
moderately
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
full
robust
and
creamy
its
an
experience
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
a
balance
this
one
is
a
wonderful
nononsense
piece
of
art
i
wish
that
i
had
another
bottle
right
now
drinkability
for
something
made
with
chocolate
this
has
a
great
need
to
be
imbibed
especially
for
desert
as
far
as
chocolate
beers
go
this
is
the
best
i
have
had
makes
an
excellent
dessert
by
itself
but
i
am
sure
it
would
go
excellent
with
a
slice
of
chocolate
cake
perhaps
it
would
even
make
a
good
cake
go
out
and
find
one
if
you
havent
because
this
is
what
a
chocolate
beer
should
be
i
bought
this
and
youngs
double
chocolate
on
the
same
trip
in
order
to
get
my
chocolate
stout
fix
i
drank
the
youngs
a
few
nights
ago
and
was
bitterly
dissapointed
i
dont
feel
that
youngs
is
up
to
the
hype
this
beer
however
is
about
as
prefect
as
i
could
imagine
from
a
chocolate
stout
pours
as
black
as
any
beer
ive
seen
with
a
frothy
mocha
colored
head
which
was
moderate
but
left
nice
lacing
aroma
was
soft
and
subtle
but
difinitely
chocolatey
doesnt
really
even
seem
like
smelling
beer
it
is
so
subtle
and
candylike
taste
is
just
right
chocolate
is
definitely
the
key
here
but
it
changes
to
mocha
and
then
to
coffee
in
the
finish
i
was
worried
that
this
would
be
too
sweet
but
it
is
perfectly
balanced
and
with
each
taste
i
respect
what
rogue
have
done
here
that
much
more
truly
a
world
class
effort
i
suspect
this
is
now
the
bar
by
which
any
chocolate
stout
will
be
judged
for
once
a
22
oz
bomber
is
not
enough
i
could
drink
this
stuff
like
coffee
not
that
i
tried
it
this
time
but
this
might
even
be
tasty
warmed
up
will
definitely
sample
again
i
think
the
saucer
has
it
on
tap
taken
as
a
whole
this
beer
is
terrific
this
is
what
i
have
been
looking
for
in
a
chocolate
beer
it
tastes
very
strongly
of
chocolate
which
is
more
than
some
other
chocolate
beers
can
say
big
body
and
bold
flavor
with
fine
balance
makes
for
a
great
beer
try
it
with
chocolate
cake
good
stuff
wow
as
i
open
this
bottle
man
the
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
sweetness
floural
hop
brown
butter
vanilla
cadbury
milk
chocolate
this
beer
pours
a
jet
black
and
leaves
a
silky
brown
head
that
looks
like
you
poured
too
much
vanilla
in
your
whipped
cream
as
i
smell
this
beer
all
the
aromas
i
talked
about
milk
chocolate
brown
butterbutterscotch
coffee
floural
hops
caramel
sugar
vanilla
are
all
on
display
in
this
beer
the
taste
of
this
beer
just
explodes
on
your
palate
it
starts
with
a
vanilla
chocolate
sweetness
then
moves
to
a
bitter
hop
kick
followed
by
a
coffee
essence
and
finally
finishes
with
a
silky
smooth
butterscotch
aftertaste
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
im
sad
i
took
this
long
to
get
to
it
i
will
not
make
that
mistake
again
cheers
this
stout
pours
a
deep
dark
color
the
head
is
a
tan
color
and
disappointingly
minimal
in
both
size
and
duration
but
this
really
does
not
distract
from
how
wonderful
tasty
this
beverage
is
the
smell
is
of
fine
mocha
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
rather
complex
being
sweet
with
a
strong
chocolate
flavor
there
is
an
occasional
bitter
finish
to
the
taste
which
is
not
overly
distracting
certainly
a
descent
stout
worth
searching
out
and
enjoying
interesting
mouthfeel
a
bit
heavy
but
very
smooth
drinking
big
flavors
but
not
overwhelming
easily
the
best
rogue
brew
ive
had
thusfar
and
best
chocolate
stout
note
ran
to
the
kitchen
to
grab
a
few
pieces
of
dark
chocolate
as
a
i
finished
this
fine
rogue
product
the
only
difference
from
this
and
the
shakespeare
stout
was
that
the
head
was
a
significantly
darker
color
and
that
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
distinct
chocolate
flavor
to
it
these
factors
do
not
make
the
beer
any
better
or
any
worse
in
my
opinon
just
different
and
to
be
honest
with
you
being
different
is
one
of
the
greatest
qualities
of
any
beer
this
normally
factors
greatly
into
my
drinkability
it
is
a
good
choice
if
you
like
these
type
of
brews
i
was
surprised
how
good
it
was
and
will
drink
it
again
definately
worth
the
adventure
cheers
with
a
name
like
chocolate
stout
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
way
to
sweet
rogue
did
an
excellent
job
the
bitterness
in
the
end
is
perfectly
done
in
contrast
to
the
chocolate
flavors
making
this
like
a
liquified
block
of
dark
chocolate
i
really
dont
see
how
this
beer
can
be
improved
flawless
beer
is
good
happy
chocolating
drinkability
very
good
d
i
only
had
one
of
these
and
would
have
another
if
i
could
on
tap
amazing
exceptional
beer
drinkability

the
overbearing
cocoa
notes
detract
from
my
ability
to
really
get
into
this
beer
but
one
can
tell
some
work
went
into
making
it
solid
not
my
cup
of
tea
pours
dark
black
with
some
minimal
brown
highlights
the
head
is
fluffy
and
pudding
like
but
doesnt
stick
around
long
espresso
and
super
dark
chocolate
smell
with
a
hidden
hop
sweetness
tastes
of
hersheys
and
coffee
with
a
sourness
that
lingers
around
the
edge
of
the
tongue
finishes
sour
and
then
fades
into
a
sweet
cocoa
mouth
feel
is
a
little
light
theres
tons
of
chocolate
to
go
around
here
if
thats
your
thing
one
question
though
what
was
the
brown
goo
left
in
the
bottom
of
my
glass
this
is
worth
picking
up
i
will
be
grabbing
a
few
more
of
these
in
the
very
near
future
d
this
beer
is
a
nice
smooth
stout
it
has
good
qualities
and
it
has
a
nice
faint
chocolate
flavor
that
is
made
with
great
grains
and
not
chocolate
powder
or
extracts
it
is
nice
to
see
a
chocolate
stout
that
is
well
balanced
with
hops
and
dark
malts
but
stays
true
to
beer
ingredients
slight
points
detracted
for
the
lingering
bitterness
in
the
end
nothing
bad
but
the
mouthfeel
is
just
slighlty
too
bitter
however
i
cant
remember
a
better
beer
i
have
ever
had
bravo
very
dark
brown
with
very
nice
tan
head
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
chocolate
alcohol
scents
are
present
wonderful
chocolate
and
smokey
flavors
very
rich
with
not
much
alcohol
as
the
scent
suggests
medium
to
full
bodied
with
light
effervesance
very
nice
perfect
appearance
almost
black
great
tan
foam
that
sticks
around
forever
and
coats
the
glass
the
smell
is
domineering
chocolate
the
taste
wow
its
almost
too
chocolatey
to
be
a
beer
you
could
confuse
it
for
some
sort
of
chocolate
liqueur
until
the
roasted
malt
kicks
in
gently
to
balance
the
chocolate
taste
there
is
also
some
molasses
sweetness
hiding
underneath
it
all
which
in
my
opinion
really
completes
this
brew
thats
all
i
get
here
but
the
interplay
is
done
to
perfection
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
and
dry
from
the
chocolate
and
the
acidity
of
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
thick
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
definitely
is
only
hurt
by
the
decadence
of
it
all
this
is
amazing
d
very
good
definitely
one
you
want
to
continue
to
sip
over
and
over
a
great
stout
just
a
damn
tasty
stout
this
beer
is
exactly
what
it
advertises
if
you
want
a
chocolate
stout
look
no
further
you
could
probably
make
chocolate
out
of
this
beer
this
stout
is
the
top
of
the
food
chain
as
far
as
the
evolution
of
american
beer
ingenuity
goes
its
like
putting
laura
secord
in
a
bottle
dark
brown
appearance
with
ample
lacing
and
serious
retention
the
smelltastemouthful
aspect
of
this
stout
was
like
a
643
double
play
in
baseball
it
just
flowed
to
a
natural
progression
culminating
with
a
chocolate
experience
unlike
any
ive
ever
had
before
exceptional
drinkability
may
be
a
gross
understatement
as
this
maybe
one
of
the
five
finest
beers
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
sip
and
sip
and
sip
and
sip
kudos
to
the
rogue
brewery
ps
please
send
more
product
to
ontario
canada
drinkability
this
is
a
fabulous
brew
replacing
youngs
double
chocolate
as
my
favorite
chocolate
beer
the
sweet
aroma
contrasting
bitterness
is
balanced
so
well
and
the
finish
just
makes
me
want
to
have
more
hmm
i
think
i
will
my
only
real
complaints
here
and
they
are
minor
is
that
at
6
abv
i
really
shouldnt
be
able
to
taste
the
alcohol
the
balance
leans
slightly
on
the
bitter
side
just
a
hair
more
sweetness
and
this
would
be
an
instant
favorite
for
dessert
that
said
this
is
a
very
good
stout
and
a
musttry
for
any
stout
or
chocolate
lover
floats
anyone
im
not
writing
off
rogue
by
any
means
it
could
be
a
bad
bottle
i
might
have
served
it
incorrectly
i
dont
know
but
i
have
to
admit
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
bit
more
drinkable
beer
chocolate
smells
like
it
tastes
like
it
looks
like
it
pours
thick
and
black
with
a
nice
mocha
head
the
chocolate
is
the
dominant
flavor
but
also
has
some
smoky
and
malty
characters
hops
were
not
too
evident
really
smooth
to
drink
unfortunately
it
was
on
special
by
the
pitcher
and
even
with
pawning
some
off
on
my
skeptical
friends
i
was
overwhelmed
after
two
pints
it
really
s
quite
bittersweet
very
enjoyable
for
a
pint
or
two
dark
dark
dark
color
with
an
absolutely
beautiful
creamy
brown
head
smells
chocolatey
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
waaaay
in
the
background
deep
very
rich
tastes
delicious
at
first
you
get
a
wave
of
coffee
and
burntness
and
then
the
chocolate
sneaks
up
on
you
deep
rich
complex
and
not
overly
sweet
and
cavityproducing
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
i
could
not
drink
a
bomber
of
this
on
my
own
but
its
damn
good
drink
your
dessert
cheers
good
though
pleasing
to
the
palate
some
might
even
wax
poetic
at
it
chocolate
and
oatmeal
aromas
pours
dark
brown
with
light
brown
creamy
head
bittersweetmostly
bitter
taste
similar
to
baking
cocoa
noticible
taste
of
hops
thick
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
if
you
are
in
the
right
mood
not
something
id
drink
a
normal
bassis
but
definitely
worth
a
try
at
6
abv
its
not
too
strong
and
would
make
a
nice
dessert
after
a
steak
dinner
try
eating
some
chocolate
while
drinking
this
beer
amazing
very
black
stout
black
like
well
dark
chocolate
pours
with
a
decent
one
finger
brown
head
that
lasts
for
most
of
the
duration
no
lace
but
thats
okay
smells
mainly
of
dark
chocolate
with
a
subtle
hint
of
roasted
malts
hmm
very
bittersweet
taste
sweet
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
a
roasted
toast
taste
as
well
nice
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
hmm
not
light
but
ligher
than
expected
i
guess
medium
light
good
but
i
was
expecting
something
thicker
drinkable
hell
yes
perhaps
not
session
beer
drinkable
but
one
could
drink
these
all
night
and
not
get
tired
of
it
the
color
is
pitch
black
with
a
lightbrown
head
that
is
incredably
thick
and
creamy
the
aroma
is
of
dark
bakers
chocolate
with
a
nice
bit
of
roastiness
thrown
in
as
well
the
taste
is
of
an
incredably
rich
sweet
chocolate
flavor
with
a
mild
roast
flavor
the
dark
chocolate
flavors
also
provide
a
moderate
bitterness
that
accenuate
the
incredable
chocolatey
flavor
a
hint
of
hops
gives
the
flavor
a
little
bit
of
an
edge
and
reminds
you
that
youre
drinking
a
rogue
product
anyway
this
is
world
class
what
a
fun
tasty
treat
this
is
a
dessert
unto
itself
and
a
neat
little
novelty
itembut
surprisingly
theres
a
darn
good
stout
in
the
midst
of
all
the
chocolate
beer
gimmickery
notes
well
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
to
date
although
shakespeare
is
right
up
there
rogue
does
a
really
nice
job
with
their
stouts
they
impressed
me
more
than
old
rasputin
or
samuel
smiths
even
and
those
are
imperials
well
done
rogue
this
is
an
excellent
beer
pours
up
thick
and
black
smooth
out
of
the
bottle
and
appealing
from
the
start
the
head
really
rises
more
so
than
i
would
have
expected
to
almost
2
12
fingers
before
settling
out
to
14
finger
and
lacing
the
glass
forever
the
head
is
mocha
in
color
and
had
large
pockets
of
air
within
exagerating
the
thick
frothy
texture
the
smell
is
sweet
and
grainy
heavy
on
chocolate
and
malt
this
is
decieving
understood
when
the
flavor
hits
your
tongue
this
beer
does
not
taste
nearly
as
sweet
as
it
smells
the
light
sugary
flavor
of
the
chocolate
and
malt
is
balanced
more
than
adequately
by
an
excellent
hop
base
the
thick
pour
of
this
beer
is
a
dead
givaway
to
the
smooth
frothy
feel
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
from
an
overall
standpoint
not
an
everday
pour
but
nice
for
special
occasions
will
drink
again
this
brew
pours
a
black
color
with
a
big
tan
head
the
aroma
is
as
chocolatey
as
chocolate
as
is
the
beer
were
chocolate
milk
the
taste
is
as
chocolatey
as
this
brews
name
suggests
there
is
also
a
hint
of
coffee
which
adds
some
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
relaxing
and
comforting

not
so
fast
did
a
vertical
with
the
shakespeare
and
the
chocolate
stouts
these
are
both
equally
impressive
in
almost
every
way
but
are
slightly
different
i
just
cant
accurately
say
which
i
like
better
and
which
id
rank
higher
if
i
had
a
gun
to
my
head
the
shakespeare
might
have
to
get
the
nod
pours
an
absolute
pitch
black
with
a
lovely
thick
tan
head
a
wonderful
and
pervasive
semisweet
baking
chocolate
aroma
in
the
nose
not
much
roastedness
detectable
the
chocolate
really
takes
over
the
taste
is
a
near
perfect
blend
of
the
chocolate
into
the
stout
flavours
it
starts
off
with
a
semisweet
chocolate
but
then
blends
seamlessly
into
the
gentle
roasted
bitteness
of
the
stout
and
finishes
with
a
subtle
hop
bitterness
no
one
flavour
dominates
and
the
meld
in
a
subtle
interplay
a
very
nicely
balanced
chocolate
stout
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
gentle
carbonation
a
very
lovely
and
exceedingly
drinkable
afterdinner
beer
quite
pleased
that
the
lcbo
decided
to
get
this
in
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
around
a
full
dark
chocolately
two
finger
head
with
a
very
dark
liquid
beer
the
smell
is
full
sweet
aromatic
and
delicious
a
dark
creamy
taste
with
hints
of
hopschocolate
and
coffee
rogue
never
stops
amazing
me
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
on
a
side
note
the
label
says
6
abv
but
i
swear
this
has
to
be
at
least
8
it
hits
pretty
hard
22
ounce
bomber
this
beer
pours
out
dark
brown
with
a
brown
head
the
aroma
is
a
delicious
chocolate
smell
with
some
roasted
malts
the
flavor
is
very
roasty
this
is
probably
the
best
use
of
chocolate
ive
tasted
in
a
beer
there
is
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
this
beer
is
mainly
bitter
the
hops
are
just
able
to
come
through
the
strong
malt
and
chocolate
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
make
sure
to
let
this
beer
warm
up
a
little
before
you
drink
the
aroma
and
flavor
really
come
through
as
the
beer
warms
i
thought
this
might
be
good
since
its
rarely
seen
on
the
shelves
the
initial
balance
is
good
and
very
drinkable
and
the
finish
has
an
initial
strong
but
balanced
metallic
grapefruit
and
astringent
smoothness
definitely
worth
a
try
a
good
offering
from
rogue
a
nice
thick
creamy
head
on
a
dark
beer
just
the
way
i
like
em
tastes
great
with
a
pronounced
roasted
flavor
lots
of
lacing
this
is
a
beer
that
is
certainly
worth
buying
again
bitterness
is
also
a
prominate
feature
a
must
try
for
dark
beer
lovers
d
awesome
but
the
body
strength
prohibits
it
from
being
a
long
session
brew
this
ones
more
of
a
meal
tasting
notes
dark
malt
that
is
slightly
charred
which
is
good
dark
semisweet
chocolate
caramel
etc
tastes
of
coffee
and
cream
of
course
it
had
chocolate
in
the

excellent

chocolate

indeed

the
smell
bring
out
roasted

but
softly
mixed
with
vanilla
and
some
almond
the
taste
is
a

chocolate
kiss

with
a

almost
gelatin
like
roast

and
a

beware
the

up
with

matter
in
my
glass
overall
a
good
drinker
and
not
bad
when
your
in
the
mood
overall
a
nice
high
quality
stout
by
rogue
full
bodied
and
delicious
i
could
buy
this
all
the
time
beer
pours
a
jet

with
a
big

beige
head
that
quickly
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of

big
cocoa
aroma
hits
right
awaymore
smelling
reveals
more
rich
luscious
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
taste
is
a
delicious
assertive
bitter
dark
chocolate
with
just
a
hint
of
floral
hops
this
is
the
most
chocolate
tasting
chocolate
stout
ive
ever
hadevery
sip
has
a
rich
chocolate
noteyou
dont
have
to
go
searching
this
is
a
perfect
beer
either
for
just
enjoying
on
its
own
or
pairing
with
a
chocolate
desert
this
is
one
i
wish
i
could
find
more
often
very
tasty
on
its
own
but
would
probably
go
very
well
with
cocolate
cake
brownies
or
ice
cream
or
all
of
the
above
high
quality
the
appearance
is
a
solid
brown
which
lets
no
light
though
this
beer
pours
with
a
nice
brownish
tan
head
which
laces
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
the
taste
of
course
is
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
with
a
nice
chocolate
taste
which
turns
with
a
slight
bitterness
a
drinkable
beer
but
because
of
the
richness
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
like
i
first
stated
high
quality
opinion
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
really
like
how
the
chocolate
is
a
noticeable
addition
rather
than
a
sharp
roast
that
comes
from
generous
helpings
of
chocolate
malt
i
personally
think
that
this
beer
could
use
an
addition
of
oatmeal
or
lactose
sugar
or
something
to
negate
the
bittering
component
added
by
the
cocoa
just
a
thought
but
still
an
excellent
beer
what
can
i
say
i
enjoyed
one
pint
six
fluid
ounces
650ml
of
an
ebony
slice
of
rich
chocolate
cake
like
your
10th
birthday
with
an
earthy
flavor
of
oats
that
gives
way
to
a
truffle
finish
oregon
brewed
sebbie
brown
could
not
have
done
better
ah
yes
sebbie
a
vision
of
beauty
silk
screened
on
the
chocolate
colored
bottle
how
appropriate
kudos
rogue
ales
brewery
kudos
indeed
serving
type
22oz
brown
bottle
this
beer
simply
put
is
amazing
pours
a
deep
chocolate
color
with
a
ruby
lining
a
small
tan
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
front
but
by
the
finish
you
would
swear
you
are
drinking
a
chocolate
shake
just
not
quite
as
thick
one
of
the
best
chocolate
beers
ive
ever
had
the
taste
is
fantastic
to
say
the
least
everything
blends
well
the
chocolate
the
roasty
taste
the
bitterness
but
not
too
bitter
it
slides
down
easily
no
strange
aftertaste
i
could
definitely
drink
more
than
one
this
beer
is
on
point
im
a
fan
of
rogue
so
i
got
what
i
expected
the
only
tip
i
could
offer
for
improvement
on
this
beer
would
be
a
smoother
mouthfeel
possibly
a
little
less
bite
it
is
not
a
big
deal
and
not
overpowering
but
something
a
bit
mellower
would
be
nice
pours
the
deepest
brown
hue
almost
black
with
a
smallish
dark
coffeecolored
head
aroma
of
rich
roasted
chocolate
malt
sweet
brown
sugar
and
a
touch
of
yeast
huge
palate
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
lactose
sugar
and
a
little
tinge
of
hop
bitterness
an
exceptional
mouthfeel
rich
smooth
more
than
a
little
like
chocolate
milk
the
perfect
accompaniment
to
a
rich
chocolate
torte
poured
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
medium
sized
tan

and
some
lacing
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
sweet
chocolate
blunt
wrap
aroma
nice
full
chocolate
taste
with
some
roasted
malt
although
i
gave
the
palate
a
4
i
was
being
generous
the
chocolate
certainly
was
there
but
it
was
not
as
rich
as
i
hoped
for
drinkability
very
drinkable
it
was
a
dark
chocolate
color
doesnt
let
any
light
through
thick
creamy
colored
head
smell
of
like
a
chocolate
esspresso
taste
is
rich
and
complex
taste
like
an
expensive
coffee
strong
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
love
to
let
the
creamy
foam
rest
on
my
palate
for
such
a
rich
complex
brew
it
is
incredibily
drinkable
it
has
a
wonderful
aftertaste
that
last
a
while
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
reward
yourself
for
lifes
great
accomplishments
such
as
mowing
the
lawn
doing
the
dishes
or
making
it
to
work
on
time
this
stout
poured
as
black
as
night
with
creamy
brown
foam
that
settled
to
a
thin
coat
and
clung
to
the
glass
a
bit
the
smell
was
full
of
chocolate
and
cocoa
with
some
mild
maltiness
as
well
the
taste
was
chocolatey
darky
bitter
with
cocoa
malt
and
some
bitter
hoppiness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
smooth
with
full
body
and
good
carbonation
the
bitter
chocolate
flavor
lingered
in
the
aftertaste
very
nice
this
was
an
excellent
beer
and
i
wonder
why
i
dont
drink
it
more
often
i
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
gorgeous
mocha
head
2
fingers
thick
the
lacing
was
pretty
sweet
but
retention
could
have
been
a
little
bit
better
such
an
awesomely
powerful
aroma
i
kept
sniffing
this
beer
all
the
way
through
the
22nd
oz
smells
like
slightly
bitter
dark
chocolate
with
just
a
tinge
of
roastiness
taste
is
less
bitter
and
more
milky
thick
and
rich
without
being
choking
tastes
just
like
milk
chocolate
not
like
beer
at
all
definitely
hides
the
alcohol
at
least
a
top
3
stout
if
not
the
best
imperials
not
included
wonderfully
filling
and
very
drinkable
skip
the
dessert
menu
this
beer
will
be
far
better
than
anything
else
there
although
perhaps
a
little
too
heavy
in
chocolate
flavour
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
to
revisit
often
its
like
chocolate
milk
for
the
beer

nice

a
slight

in
the

a
very
good
beer
not
a
whole
lot
of
different
flavors
just
2
or
3
that
are
seriously
bold
now
i
need
to
find
a
cookie
and
some
ice
cream
pours
pitch
black
maybe
the
blackest
stout
ive
seen
barely
a
glitter
of
light
through
the
edges
when
held
up
to
a
light
big
two
finger
coffee
colored
head

excellent

and
good

is
amazing
cocoa

chocolate

dark
bakers
choclate
i
almost
dont
want
to
stop
smelling
it
taste
doesnt
disappoint
though
same
multifaceted
chocolate
flavors
as
in
the
nose
with
some
mocha
espresso
and
a
slight
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
not
the
most
complex
overall
taste
package
but
a
delicious
one
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
fairly
well
carbonated
smooth
yet
crisp
i
have
found
that
rougue
ales
tend
to
be
delicious
but
fairly
onedimensional
out
of
the
4
rougues
ive
tried
hazelnut
nectar
mocha
porter
and
shakespeare
being
the
others
this
is
the
most
robust
and
interesting
simply
a
world
class
stout
if
you
like
chocolate
not
overpoweringly
sweet
just
the
right
amount
of
coffeehop
bitterness
a
must
try
for
any
stout
lover
bottle
obtained
from
superior
liquor
colorado
and
consumed
a
couple
evenings
later
in
august
2005
pours
a
two
finger
dark
brown
head
over
a
pitch
black
liquid
no
edging
when
held
to
light
smells
wow
chocolate
molasses
a
hint
of
roast
sweet
malty
chocolatey
desert
chocolate
dominating
the
flavor
with
bourbon
cherries
underneath
campfire
wood
fudgecicle
okay
a
minute
of
sniffing
and
the
head
is
a
thin
layer
over
the
beer
whats
it
taste
like
starts
chocolate
with
some
cherry
ie
black
patent
sour
while
these
start
strong
they
become
very
powerful
during
the
swallow
and
in
the
aftertaste
as
they
rise
they
get
a
more
refined
quality
and
a
faint
espressocoffeeroast
steps
in
too
as
strong
as
the
flavors
are
im
surprised
the
flavors
arent
clinging
to
my
tongue
the
body
is
heavy
but
not
thick
the
finish
is
quite
clean
dry
actually
with
some
hop
bitter
a
touch
of
citrusy
hop
flavor
puts
the
chocolate
on
guard
oddly
there
is
a
flavor
in
my
mouth
like
i
just
toked
on
a
cigarette
after
several
months
without
one
nah
maybe
its
just
a
bit
of
wood
flavor
like
the
wood
that
i
found
in
the
smell
anyway
this
was
a
really
enjoyable
beer
as
much
as
i
hate
rogue
for
the
overpriced
offerings
theyve
recently
put
out
you
know
those
bottles
that
are
superpremium
priced
in
flashy
but
stupid
bottles
i
have
to
admit
they
make
really
tasty
beers
notes
if
you
drink
it
cold
it
has
a
dry
coffee
type
characteristic
when
it
warmed
the
chocolate
was
in
control
drinkability
was
exceedingly
good
although
i
like
stouts
i
am
not
what
could
be
termed
a
stout
lover
my
favorite
style
is
double
ipa
so
i
prefer
much
hoppier
somewhat
lighter
beers
but
i
could
have
had
another
of
these
and
it
was
in
a
22
oz
bomber
had
this
brew
for
dessert
tonight
didnt
need
anything
else
an
excellent
way
to
end
the
night
i
put
off
trying
this
brew
for
some
time
mostly
because
i
tend
to
take
rogues
line
for
granted
since
its
so
readily
available
im
glad
i
finally
gave
it
a
try
will
defintely
be
looking
for
this
beer
in
the
fall
pitch
black
color
with
a
large
creamy
brown
head
smells
rich
with
sweet
chocolate
coffee
malts
and
a
hint
of
bitter
hops
the
flavor
is
full
of
hints
of
burnt
malts
and
bittersweet
chocolate
kind
of
like
chocolate
chips
a
hint
of
bitter
hops
pull
through
full
bodied
and
a
creamy
silky
mouthfeel
has
a
semidry
bittersweet
aftertaste
damn
this
is
a
good
stout
one
of
the
best
flavored
stouts
i
have
ever
had
i
had
the
first
glass
by
itself
and
the
second
with
a
slice
of
cherry
pie
cant
go
wrong
either
way
very
nice
drinkability
i
have
to
say
i
wouldnt
want
this
all
the
time
i
would
however
like
to
try
it
with
a
dessert
next
time
as
pairing
this
with
many
different
things
would
probably
make
some
amazing
texture
and
flavor
combinations
im
going
to
get
another
one
asap
and
save
it
again
for
another
night
sipping
for
as
long
as
possible
this
is
easily
the
best
chocolate
beer
that
ive
had
strong
aromas
of
chocolate
along
with
the
slightest
hint
of
roasted
coffee
the
flavor
is
of
authentic
chocolate
not
processed
chocolate
syrup
but
real
chocolate
the
sweetness
is
well
balanced
by
the
hops
and
some
munichish
malts
id
be
in
big
trouble
if
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
i
still
like
it
very
much
but
theres
much
bigger
goals
in
life
this
beer
pours
black
with
brown
head
the
head
stuck
around
for
a
little
while
but
slowly
faded
into
a
ring
around
my
glass
the
nose
is
amazing
it
smells
like
chocolate
mixed
with
maple
syrup
the
flavor
is
also
very
chocolatey
with
sort
of
a
maple
flavor
thing
going
on
in
there
as
well
i
also
detect
some
coffee
flavor
this
is
the
best
stout
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
great
mouthfeel
nice
and
creamy
with
a
full
body
very
drinkable
beer
a
must
try
big
bottle
with
a
characteristic
rogue
illustration
on
it
poured
dark
brown
with
a
massive
dense
lightupsbrown
head
that
laced
well
organic
chocholate
and
caramel
on
the
nose
plenty
of
coffee
too
something
like
burnt
wood
lingering
too
tastes
just
the
same
as
it
smells
with
the
addition
of
one
of
the
best
feels
you
just
want
to
let
it
linger
and
caress
your
tongue
ive
had
given
the
stye
i
think
the
feel
is
not
improvable
i
cant
say
its
too
drinkable
though
although
id
certainly
go
for
it
because
it
is
a
bit
sensory
overwhelming
kinda
of
like
the
feeling
i
get
when
i
have
a
nice
scotch
with
a
fresh
chocolate
cookie
flavor
has
rogue
quality
im
assuming
from
the
yeast
i
like
this
but
not
like
others
do
but
its
not
up
to
some
of
their
other
beers
like
shakespeare
dn
i
think
if
i
ever
have
this
on
cask
i
may
drop
dead
of
the
sheer
pleasure
im
trying
very
hard
to
fight
giving
this
one
fives
across
the
board
i
can
picture
this
one
on
cask
and
it
haunts
me
the
brewers
at
rogue
have
come
up
with
a
true
masterpiece
one
of
the
finest
beers
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
this
isnt
beer
this
is
pure
indulgence
in
liquid
form
buy
this
beer
if
you
see
it
buy
three
its
that
good
i
could
drink
these
all
night
but
i
could
see
where
it
would
be
filling
for
some
excellent
with
a
meal
but
stands
strong
by
itself
as
a
dessert
beer
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
think
its
possibly
just
a
tad
overrated
if
you
want
a
smooth
chocolate
stout
get
youngs
if
you
want
a
big
robust
and
intensely
hoppy
stout
get
shakespeare
or
storm
king
this
is
somewhere
inbetween
and
its
not
so
much
fencesitting
as
trying
to
get
the
best
of
both
worlds
in
my
assessment
it
doesnt
quite
work
some
people
might
give
this
a
low
drinkability
score
because
its
so
thick
and
full
of
flavor
and
filling
i
wont
i
could
drink
this
stuff
morning
noon
and
night
i
would
drink
this
morning
noon
and
night
if
schoolworkmoneylife
in
general
wouldnt
get
in
the
way
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
thin
khaki
head
that
never
quite
disappears
first
smell
reveals
creamy
chocolate
but
swirling
the
glass
a
little
uncovers
roasted
grain
coffee
and
even
some
lovely
hops
ubersmooth
malts
begin
the
flavor
with
the
creamy
milk
chocolate
coming
in
pleasantly
early
the
sweet
smooth
chocolate
sticks
around
adding
an
extremely
nice
flavor
to
this
stout
roasted
grain
is
there
along
with
a
little
fresh
roasted
coffee
finish
has
a
hint
of
citrous
hops
with
also
provide
subtle
spice
long
aftertaste
keeps
this
hoppy
chocolate
wonder
in
my
mouth
long
after
swallowing
a
truely
exceptional
brew
from
rogue
this
is
only
my
third
time
or
so
having
this
style
of
beerchocolate
stout
i
must
say
i
was
overwhelmed
with
the
wonderful
chocolate
taste
and
smooth
drinkability
of
this
beer
i
ordered
this
brew
at
a
restaurant
before
my
food
came
and
damn
near
wanted
to
cancel
my
food
and
have
a
two
or
three
more
of
these
as
this
is
a
very
filling
beer
this
one
would
taste
great
paired
with
damn
near
anything
or
alone
rogue
has
definately
done
it
again
with
this
one
man
am
i
glad
i
found
this
one
on
tap
this
seems
to
me
to
be
what
other
chocolate
stouts
should
be
measured
by
it
came
in
a
22oz
bottle
but
wish
it
either
larger
or
i
bought
several
a
very
good
stout
indeed
this
is
an
outstanding
dessert
beer
i
feel
like
i
should
have
a
nice
cigar
around
though
my
bronchitis
keeps
that
from
being
an
option
havent
had
a
cigar
in
4
months
no
longer
smoke
anything
else
at
all
yet
i
get
bronchitis
from
fing
allgergies
doh
this
is
way
too
sweet
to
have
several
pints
but
as
a
one
bottle
per
session
beer
its
quite
nice
this
will
have
to
serve
as
my
new
beer
sunday
beer
as
im
off
to
wenatchee
for
several
days
and
coincidentally
dont
anticipate
anything
new
or
frankly
good
for
several
days
brown
head
lasting
long
and
stylish
like
black
beercolor
nose
is
exceptional
giving
away
a
magnificent
chocolate
arome
surrounded
by
great
maltarome
and
beautiful
hopbouqet
in
a
very
dry
a
strawlike
surrounding
never
expirienced
a
chocolate
aroma
fresh
and
good
as
that
taste
is
also
great
being
dry
burnt
again
straw
like
and
litle
cacao
give
it
a
strange
not
but
hell
yes
this
is
highly
enjoyable
and
great
to
drink
teasing
my
mouth
and
nose
and
whole
body
to
take
another
sip
what
a
great
beer
imho
this
brew
pours
a
dark
murkey
black
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
to
a
very
generous
ring
over
top
of
the
brew
i
dont
know
if
a
stout
can
look
any
better
the
nose
is
just
like
cooled
down
hot
chocolate
huge
milkchocolate
just
nails
me
in
the
nose
its
almost
like
sniffing
the
concentrated
powder
before
adding
liquid
this
truely
is
a
chocolate
stout
the
flavor
is
very
chocolate
but
with
a
backbone
of
deep
roasted
to
burnt
malt
i
enjoy
it
the
feel
is
where
this
brew
falters
its
moderate
at
best
i
would
really
like
to
see
a
nice
healthy
thickness
on
the
feel
it
really
deserves
it
overall
not
a
bad
brew
i
find
it
easy
drinking
the
flavor
is
pretty
darn
nice
head
to
head
with
a
brooklyn
black
chocolate
it
would
falter
but
it
is
definately
doing
the
trick
for
me
right
now
drinkability
is
high
for
its
style
just
6
makes
this
a
session
brew
if
you
like
the
type
i
would
personally
prefer
brooklyns
chocolate
stout
a
bit
more
but
both
are
two
of
the
best
out
there
split
a
bomber
with
the
wife
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
brown
opaque
but
not
black
with
a
rocky
tan
head
lacing
graced
the
sides
of
the
glass
nose
is
a
licorice
and
dark
chocolate
blend
with
some
cocoa
light
vanilla
hints
also
taste
is
burnt
malt
maybe
the
hops
kicking
in
there
with
chocolate
overall
finish
is
bitter
just
this
side
of
dry
mouthfeel
is
creamy
in
the
middle
but
wet
around
the
edges
a
fine
tasting
chocolate
stout
though
i
prefer
the
brooklyn
and
the
youngs
over
this
i
would
never
refuse
one
though
i
just
love
rogue
ales
tough
to
go
wrong
with
them
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
hige
brown
head
and
great
lace
smwlls
of
bittersweet
chocolate
with
some
highly
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
tastes
of
a
highly
roasted
malt
with
a
bitterswet
chocolate
probably
as
close
to
burt
as
you
can
get
without
actually
being
burt
tick
and
chewy
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
coffee
like
bitternes
on
the
tongue
not
a
huge
drinkability
factor
due
to
its
heavyness
but
will
make
a
great
dessert
brew
an
excellent
dessert
beverage
pours
an
almost
pitch
black
with
a
bumpy
brown
colored
head
there
are
some
little
chunks
of
chocolate
in
there
too
smells
like
umm
chocolate
of
course
it
is
a
bit
more
complex
than
that
if
i
had
to
put
a
finger
on
it
id
say
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
german
chocolate
cake
taste
has
a
nice
bittersweet
chocolate
flavor
with
some
dark
roasted
malt
i
do
have
to
admit
i
occassionally
taste
an
odd
metallic
offflavor
from
what
i
gather
this
wasnt
an
old
bottle
either
this
is
very
disappointing
because
overall
this
is
one
fine
stout
mouthfeel
is
also
a
tad
thin
for
such
a
heavy
looking
beer
very
smooth
almost
like
chocolate
milk
ill
always
try
and
have
one
of
these
in
my
stash
pours
with
a
onefinger
light
brown
head
that
leaves
a
little
lace
totally
opaque
black
color
medium
bodied
and
light
carbonation
nose

of
chocolate
and
hops

for
a
22oz
bottle
from
northend
superette
manchester
nh
22
oz
bomber
straight
into
a
large
snifter
pours
black
not
even
a
dark
red
it
pours
black
the
head
was
a
dark
brown
almost
looked
like
some
kind
of
chocolate
frosting
placed
on
top
smells
of
burnt
coffee
strong
chocolate
and
mild
hops
and
alcohol
first
taste
is
of
strong
coffee
strong
chocolate
and
it
finished
with
a
satisfying
mix
of
chocolate
and
mild
hop
kick
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
tried
but
one
that
i
keep
coming
back
to
highly
recommended
this
beer
pours
out
of
a
bomber
into
a
pint
with
a
2
finger
dark
brown
colored
head
and
a
jet
black
color
that
light
cannot
pervade
the
smell
is
utterly
fantastic
easily
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
ever
come
across
it
smells
like
the
best
dessert
you
could
imagine
dark
yet
sweet
chocolate
truffle
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
perfection
the
taste
nearly
lives
up
to
the
smell
begins
with
bitter
hops
that
resemble
a
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
followed
by
a
smooth
malty
middle
and
ends
with
a
sweet
milk
chocolate
sweetnesss
that
rests
on
the
tongue
along
with
a
slight
hops
bitterness
a
perfectly
put
togeather
stout
one
of
the
best
stouts
period
and
easily
the
best
chocolate
stout
ive
tried
not
very
drinkable
22oz
is
the
most
i
could
see
drinking
at
a
time
and
its
quite
filling
goes
well
with
any
type
of
fine
chocolate
excellent
stout
period
the
drinkability
is
nice
a
22
oz
bomber
is
perfect
for
this
one
drinkability
one
of
my
top
chocolate
flavored
stouts
not
quite
as
good
as
stone
irs
but
not
that
far
quite
delicious
would
be
great
as
an
after
dinner
dessert
finger
licking
good
pours
jet
black
with
decent
head
retention
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
aromas
of
chocolate
coffee
maybe
some
fruits
present
taste
is
quite
bold
not
overly
complex
just
a
ton
of
chocolate
creamyness
maybe
a
touch
of
coffee
and
a
pronounced
hop
finish
the
hopchocolate
dynamic
was
an
interesting
one
although
it
very
much
limits
this
beers
drinkability
in
my
opinion
a
very
good
beer
though
not
quite
as
complex
as
i
was
expecting
ive
had
it
on
draft
before
and
found
that
to
be
a
much
better
experience
i
would
drink
this
out
of
the
bottle
again
though
taste
is
very
bitter
a
great
hoppish
finish
that
beer
has
some
dark
chocolate
flavours
and
roasted
malts
are
also
present
it
is
quite
different
but
even
me
a
hophead
i
do
thing
the
imbalance
between
the
hops
and
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
not
very
pleasurable
for
long
not
a
bad
beer
just
it
doesnt
go
down
smoothly
compared
to
well
balanced
american
stout
edit
i
ended
up
mixing
the
second
half
of
this
bomber
with
the
second
half
of
the
rogue
chipotle
ale
i
just
reviewed
as
well
for
a
molé
black
tan
it
was
good
but
i
think
i
liked
this
beer
better
on
its
own
as
the
smokiness
of
the
chipotle
ale
tends
to
overpower
the
chocolate
this
is
an
artistic
and
imaginative
beer
whose
exotic
properties
are
neither
shy
nor
misplaced
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
the
brew
developed
a
nice
dark
tan
head
that
dropped
down
to
a
very
fine
cap
after
about
5
minutes
coffee
chocolate
dark
roasted
malts
wafted
from
the
glass
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
dominated
the
initial
sip
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
swirl
the
aroma
around
in
the
mouth
and
i
can
still
taste
the
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
some
oatiness
too
slightly
dry
on
the
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
very
much
and
plan
on
getting
some
more
in
the
future
pours
a
beautiful
pitch
black
with
a
great
big
dark
tan
head
smells
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
expected
like
high
quality
hot
cocoa
mix
burnt
coffee
and
malt
aromas
as
well
tastes
like
cocoa
beer
a
very
prominent
chocolate
flavor
dominates
at
first
then
fades
into
a
bitter
coffee
flavor
finish
is
dry
with
a
slight
chocolate
aftertaste
this
beer
is
a
little
heavy
on
the
sweetness
but
as
it
is
a
chocolate
stout
that
is
not
to
be
counted
against
it
reminds
me
of
a
more
inyourface
version
of
youngs
double
chocolate
as
a
novelty
i
did
enjoy
this
brew
pours
black
with
a
rich
tan
head
to
die
for
chocolate
aroma
dominates
burnt
bitter
taste
eddy
in
a
river
of
chocolate
that
flows
from
chocolate
mountains
great
beer
to
end
a
tasting
session
it
could
not
get
much
better
not
embarrassed
to
stand
behind
the
high
marks
why
the
low
drinkability
rating
i
noticed
that
i
was
getting
more
than
my
14
share
joe
derek
and
dave
thanks
for
a
nice
evening
with
five
craft
brews
ending
with
this
standout
notes
this
was
a
very
good
stout
i
love
the
chocolate
as
being
an
aftertaste
this
chocolate
was
not
over
powering
but
right
where
it
needs
to
be
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
price
but
i
was
impressed
with
the
quality
and
taste
as
wonka
says
invention
my
dear
friends
is
93
perspiration
6
electricity
4
evaporation
and
2
butterscotch
ripple
in
this
case
its
2
rogue
magic
deep
black
pour
with
a
tight
thick
head
of
dark
brown
bubbles
head
retains
pretty
well
before
eventually
dissipating
smell
is
sweet
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
just
a
little
bit
of
hoppiness
to
go
along
with
the
big
roasted
malts
flavor
is
roasted
malt
with
a
lot
of
chocolate
but
its
different
from
most
chocolate
stouts
ive
had
the
addition
of
the
real
chocolate
seems
to
give
it
a
feel
that
doesnt
taste
like
cocoa
powder
was
poured
in
after
the
beer
was
brewed
its
deliciously
complex
and
tasty
and
not
at
all
cloyingly
sweet
the
cascade
hops
are
always
there
in
each
sip
and
tie
everything
together
nicely
i
might
not
want
more
than
a
bomber
of
this
in
a
sitting
but
its
delicious
head
and
shoulders
above
all
of
the
other
chocolate
stouts
out
there
if
this
one
didnt
cost
so
much
i
think
id
drink
it
all
the
time
i
enjoyed
this
with
a
bowl
of
vanilla
ice
cream
on
top
of
a
banana
delish
highly
recommended
nice
job
rogue
slàinte
wow
powerful
chocolate
flavor
up
front
followed
quickly
by
a
light
hop
bitterness
maybe
a
little
too
bitter
the
richness
lent
by
the
malt
up
front
doesnt
balance
as
well
with
the
hop
here
great
velvety
mouth
feel
still
very
drinkable
pours
an
opaque
deep
brown
color
with
a
growing
chocolate
milk
colored
head
leaving
nice
lacing
as
the
head
subsides
delicate
aroma
of
chocolate
amongst
black
patent
and
chocolate
malts
a
touch
of
oat
and
a
decent
hop
aroma
for
a
stout
almost
too
chocolatey
roasted
barley
scorchiness
helps
alleviate
this
stout
from
being
too
distracting
with
chocolate
decent
dryness
in
the
finish
from
the
hops
nicely
balanced
between
chocolatey
sweetness
and
the
drier
finish
subtle
carbonation
works
well
on
its
own
a
solid
stout
the
addition
of
chocolate
makes
it
a
bit
more
luxurious
and
exotic
im
not
really
even
a
big
fan
of
chocolate
but
this
stout
is
great
no
synthetic
chocolate
taste
whatsoever
however
is
is
a
touch
too
cloying
to
make
a
sessioner
out
of
cheers
heck
pair
this
up
with
some
black
forest
cake
and
drink
this
instead
of
milk
next
time
great
stuff
pours
black
with
a
brownish
tan
head
the
name
of
this
brew
cant
even
trick
mr
obvious
smells
of
chocolate
with
hints
of
coffee
as
far
as
taste
goes
this
one
tops
the
stout
chart
and
you
guessed
it
tastes
like
chocolate
however
i
had
a
22oz
bottle
of
this
and
if
i
hadnt
shared
it
i
probably
couldnt
have
finished
it
by
myself
a
12oz
bottle
would
be
a
perfect
serving
size
overall
another
wonderful
beer
by
rogue
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
just
like
melted
dark
chocolate
the
head
is
dark
tan
with
good
head
retention
it
leaves
a
good
amount
of
laces
on
the
glass
it
smells
like
chocolate
there
are
hints
of
rosted
malts
but
the
chocolate
is
the
dominant
aroma
this
beer
smells
stronger
of
chocolate
than
any
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
tastes
like
chocolate
i
cant
really
say
any
more
about
that
it
tastes
like
carbonated
slightly
malty
chocolate
it
goes
down
smooth
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
the
carbonation
is
just
right
i
think
that
this
beer
is
very
good
however
i
think
that
the
strong
chocolate
flavor
might
become
a
little
bit
much
after
a
few
pints
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
you
need
to
soon
black
hole
colored
if
i
must
say
so
with
no
light
transmission
i
do
believe
light
is
actually
being
sucked
into
this
beer
there
was
ample
brown
head
to
begin
with
which
reduced
to
barely
a
coating
aroma
was
of
toffee
with
hits
of
tootsie
rolls
and
expresso
flavors
of
ample
toasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
smoke
chocolate
is
definately
a
major
player
in
this
beer
there
was
also
an
unexpected
touch
of
slightly
citrus
hops
coming
through
almost
like
that
orange
flavored
chocolate
you
get
around
the
holidays
and
at
the
very
end
was
a
tiny
amount
of
coffee
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
i
expected
not
really
heavy
at
all
this
is
a
good
afterdinner
beer
that
id
gladly
have
a
couple
of
and
will
revist
again
this
beer
pours
dark
with
a
little
dark
creamy
head
the
smell
is
amazing
perhaps
the
best
part
of
the
stout
it
is
very
chocolatey
with
a
roasted
malt
sneaking
in
behind
the
beer
is
tasty
and
isnt
too
grainy
from
the
chocolate
but
becomes
hard
to
drink
have
one
but
plan
on
sharing
the
bottle
with
a
friend
or
two
so
that
you
dont
have
to
drink
so
much
chocolate
in
summary
a
stout
which
defies
logic
in
obtaining
a
nonintrusive
but
very
rich
flavor
all
the
while
not
trading
off
on
the
drinkability
factor
cheers
presentation
packaged
in
a
twentytwo
ounce
enameled
brown
glass
poptop
bomber
served
in
a
standard
pint
tapglass
overall
a
good
beer
worth
revisiting
im
starting
to
try
rogues
selections
and
i
am
enjoying
them
as
all
stouts
do
this
one
also
pours
a
dark
coffee
color
a
tan
head
meets
the
top
of
the
glass
and
hangs
for
a
spell
then
leaves
no
trace
aroma
of
semisweet
chocolate
is
dominate
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
the
taste
was
a
surprise
i
thought
it
would
be
over
done
as
some
other
chocolate
type
brews
but
this
was
well
balanced
with
the
chocolate
flavor
it
was
not
as
sick
sweet
but
a
bitter
sweet
maybe
the
malt
and
hops
used
blended
this
well
bottom
line
enjoyable
but
too
much
chocolate
could
drive
me
nuts
after
awhile
so
i
couldnt
put
this
as
a
session
brew
but
definitely
in
the
desert
category
if
you
have
had
other
chocolate
brews
and
did
not
care
for
themtry
this
one
from
rogue
it
may
change
your
mind
a
very
drinkable
stout
from
rogue
comments
this
is
a
pretty
incredible
beer
highly
recommended
black
opaque
color
with
an
outstanding
head
that
dies
down
to
small
froth
chocolate
aroma
nice
fluffy
body
with
a
maltchocolate
flavor
aftertaste
is
of
bittersweet
chocolate
a
wonderful
dessert
stout
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
ever
wanted
to
pour
over
ice
cream
oy
vey
this
is
one
special
glass
of
stout
like
a
rich
chocolate
cake
with
only
a
fraction
of
the
calories
it
is
definitely
a
one
per
night
brew
the
rich
complexity
of
this
one
would
be
too
much
for
a
repeat
this
is
my
first
chocolate
stout
i
was
hesitant
to
try
it
because
i
was
afraid
that
it
would
be
too
much
on
the
chocolate
side
but
it
was
not
and
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
in
the
hypothetical
if
you
could
choose
only
one
beer
game
this
would
be
a
contender
it
manages
to
be
completely
inoffensive
and
flavorrich
at
the
same
time
nice
body
but
not
great
goes
down
smooth
this
is
one
of
the
hoppiest
stouts
ive
ever
drank
very
good
bashiba
i
owe
you
big
for
this
one
merry
christmas
lush
creamy
mouthfeel
fullbodied
with
silklike
carbonation
finishes
with
a
balance
of
chocolate
malt
flavors
and
bright
sprucey
hops
this
beer
continues
to
be
one
of
my
all
time
favs
i
had
this
on
tap
at
smokin
joes
in
pittsburgh
this
is
one
top
notch
beer
poured
a
beautiful
black
with
awesome
cascading
action
a
brown
head
that
stuck
around
to
the
very
end
and
left
awesome
lacing
the
smell
is
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
some
hops
the
taste
amazing
dark
chocolate
and
toasted
malts
with
the
aftertaste
of
a
chocolate
truffel
the
mouthfeel
was
rich
and
creamy
just
as
expected
it
was
so
good
i
had
to
have
another
very
drinkable
yet
another
awesome
brew
from
our
friends
at
rogue
wow
another
killer
from
rogue
this
boys
are
doing
some
great
things
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
waaay
too
much
to
drink
in
one
sitting
id
settle
for
6
or
7
oz
once
in
a
while
i
doubt
id
buy
again
unless
i
have
someone
to
share
with
which
isnt
likely
drinkability
its
always
nice
to
taste
a
stout
thats
fullflavored
like
an
imperial
but
lacks
the
high
abv
so
that
it
can
be
drunk
endlessly
try
one
pours
black
with
mahogany
highlights
and
thick
tan
head
which
leaves
good
lace
along
the
glass
smells
of
very
strong
coffee
malts
chocolate
malts
and
actual
chocolate
backed
with
hop
spice
flavor
is
a
lovely
balance
of
coffee
malts
bittersweet
chocolate
and
cascade
hops
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
chewy
but
relatively
drinkable
for
a
beer
this
heavy
extremely
appetizing
as
a
desert
beer
overall
i
think
other
rogues
have
spoiled
me
because
this
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
like
i
hoped
it
would
either
way
i
recommend
it
because
it
is
still
a
great
very
tasty
chocolate
stout
just
not
exactly
to
my
taste
the
heavy
viscocity
might
hurt
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
truly
this
beer
is
a
liquefied
chocolate
bar
and
not
of
the
dirty
american
stepchild
variety
a
chocoholics
dream
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
frothy
tan
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
intense
chocolate
the
smell
is
really
great
but
i
was
dissapointed
by
the
lack
of
chocolate
in
the
taste
it
was
sweet
malty
with
some
hops
and
there
was
a
slight
chocolate
flavor
but
nothing
like
i
expected
from
the
aroma
nice
thick
bodied
beer
like
a
glass
of
chocolate
milk
excellent
drinkablity
definately
a
session
beer
black
and
thick
with
a
creamy
brown
head
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
some
coffee
taste
was
roasty
dark
bitter
chocolate
somewhat
smokey
somewhat
sweet
after
taste
was
a
nice
milky
unsweetened
chocolate
flavour
full
bodied
yet
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
just
delicious
pitch
black
pour
rather
longlasting
big
tan
head
rich
malty
aroma
reminiscent
of
chocolate
milk
smarties
vanilla
definitely
reminds
me
of
smarties
gets
a
bit
too
tart
citric
and
lactic
to
be
extremely
enjoyable
to
me
but
as
far
as
sweet
stouts
go
ive
rarely
encountered
better
i
guess
id
just
love
it
more
would
another
less
citric
hop
replace
those
astringent
cascades
well
made
nutty
bitter
finish
counters
the
heavy
sweetness
although
it
tastes
more
like
bitter
black
chocolate
gets
roastier
and
roastier
as
it
warms
like
burnt
chocolate
good
full
body
oatmealish
velvety
looks
like
chocoalte
smells
like
chocolate
and
tastes
like
chocolate
my
first
chocolate
stout
and
i
was
amazed
how
this
beer
really
does
taste
like
chocolate
the
beer
is
almost
black
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
tan
leather
head
that
did
not
last
long
but
left
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
rich
strong
smell
of
chocoate
and
the
taste
is
a
tart
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
coffee
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
for
such
a
unique
tasting
beer
brown
650
ml
bottle
freshness
code
on
rear
label
i
poured
this
beer
out
of
the
silkscreened
bomber
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
body
of
this
looks
nicely
dense
on
the
pour
and
its
just
about
as
black
as
any
other
big
stout
ive
seen
before
the
head
is
surprisingly
light
sort
of
a
very
light
tan
that
sucker
is
immobile
for
a
long
time
though
it
hangs
tougher
than
the
new
kids
big
fat
clumps
of
foamy
lace
cling
to
the
glass
as
the
liquid
descends
down
my
glass
the
aroma
is
very
inviting
roasty
nutty
and
not
surprisingly
a
big
fat
dollop
of
milk
chocolate
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
really
nice
stout
mixed
with
chocolate
milk
its
that
chocolatey
the
flavor
is
predominately
charred
malt
and
soft
chewy
milk
chocolate
the
cascade
hops
put
their
foot
down
a
bit
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
but
arent
quite
as
assertive
here
as
i
perceive
them
in
some
of
rogues
other
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
an
even
medium
id
say
and
the
carbonation
lightens
the
perception
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
and
ive
never
tasted
this
much
chocolate
in
any
other
beer
before
dark
and
thick
very
roasty
not
in
aroma
but
certainly
in
solid
and
smooth
stout
rolled
oats
provide
body
and
sweetness
to
otherwise
semibitter
chocolate
very
drinkable
very
natural
and
well
rounded
not
sweet
nor
bitter
nicely
hopped
rich
mediumfull
mouthfeel
although
this
beer
was
pricy
5
65
cdn
for
a
650
ml
bottle
it
was
one
that
i
had
to
try
i
was
not
disappointed
in
the
least
it
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
with
a
thick
and
creamy
light
brown
head
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
and
a
sweet
coffeelike
aroma
the
taste
is
amazing
like
an
alcoholized
mix
of
rich
chocolate
milk
and
espresso
the
finish
is
like
a
piece
of
bittersweet
chocolate
melting
down
the
throat
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
nice
a
nice
sweetbitter
flavour
sticks
around
for
a
while
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definitely
be
purchasing
it
again
soon
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
it
goes
down
smoothly
drinkability
is
right
up
there
as
well
it
tates
so
good
i
just
want
to
keep
downing
it
forget
the
cake
pie
cookies
or
anything
else
after
a
fine
meal
serve
some
rogue
chocolate
stout
instead
bottle
poured
a
pitch
black
stout
with
a
medium
brownish
head
with
better
then
average
retention
i
was
quite
surprised
at
the
hoppy
aroma
with
light
chocolate
roasted
coffee
notes
i
guess
my
expectation
because
of
the
name
were
to
find
real
discernable
chocolate
taste
instead
i
feel
that
the
overabundance
of
hops
covered
the
chocolate
with
a
lingering
bitterness
a
bit
more
sweet
and
chocolate
taste
would
have
been
a
better
representation
of
what
to
expect
of
a
chocolate
stout
nonetheless
this
is
a
very
good
stout
sampled
while
in
vegas
poured
from
a
650
ml
brown
bottle
silkscreened
label
a
pitch
black
body
blocks
out
the
light
large
creamy
tan
head
intense
chocolate
aroma
with
faint
hops
sweet
milk
chocolate
flavour
with
dry
coffee
balanced
out
with
the
cascade
hops
smooth
mouthfeel
effervescent
and
somewhat
light
not
necessarily
a
session
ale
but
one
thats
worth
picking
up
on
a
regular
basis
note
one
really
cool
thing
about
this
beer
is
theres
a
residue
left
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
thats
like
the
stuff
you
see
in
a
quick
chocolate
milk
mix
it
might
be
yeast
but
it
really
tastes
like
chocolate
this
beer
is
totally
made
with
real
chocolate
an
excellent
marriage
of
chocolate
and
beer
worth
every
penny
tasty
and
well
crafted
go
buy
a
couple
and
be
prepared
to
enjoy
i
am
really
careful
to
ever
label
a
beer
as
being
perfect
but
the
beer
gods
allowed
me
to
taste
the
nectar
of
heaven
this
beer
is
phenomenal
is
every
aspect
of
the
sense
the
22oz
bomber
is
a
godsend
this
poured
out
a
beautiful
pitch
black
with
fluffy
tan
head
that
resembled
that
of
a
rootbeer
float
the
smell
had
definate
hints
of
chocolate
that
just
teased
the
senses
that
first
sip
got
my
motorneurons
running
100
mph
the
sweet
taste
of
chocolate
was
followed
by
a
little
burnt
taste
and
the
combinate
was
spectacular
this
truly
is
the
finest
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
whoa
call
me
the
koolaid
man
but
i
had
to
exclaim
oh
yeah
when
i
had
this
beer
luckily
i
hadnt
had
enough
to
bust
through
a
wall
yet
deep
brown
with
a
puffy
tan
head
looked
good
but
didnt
look
so
special
but
smelled
like
a
hersheys
special
dark
or
the
bags
of
chocolate
chips
i
used
to
steal
from
the
kitchen
cupboard
ultra
creamy
fabulous
semisweet
chocolate
malts
with
a
lightly
citrusy
hopped
coffee
finish
goes
down
crazy
smooth
with
great
lacing
all
the
way
superb
i
like
this
stout
would
recommend
it
and
actually
prefer
it
to
st
ambroise
oatmeal
stout
one
tip
when
you
pour
this
from
the
large
bottle
leave
2
fingers
in
the
bottle
swirl
it
then
pour
this
into
your
glass
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
delicious
oat
and
cocoa
sediment
on
the
bottom
that
really
aids
in
the
smoothness
of
the
finish
22
oz
bomber
with
a
chick
holding
a
mug
of
stout
on
the
front
poured
a
black
brew
with
a
deep
brown
head
that
didnt
last
long
the
aroma
is
fairly
mild
with
hints
of
roasted
grains
chocolate
and
herbal
hops
the
flavor
is
exceptional
as
this
stout
has
a
sweetness
in
the
beginning
just
as
chocolate
itself
has
a
sweet
creamy
inital
flavor
while
the
beer
then
segues
to
a
nice
chocolate
finish
matched
by
roasted
malt
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
in
regards
to
carbonation
but
i
believe
that
the
body
is
a
bit
light
very
drinkable
with
spicy
foods
as
an
excellent
contrast
of
flavors
as
the
stout
cuts
through
the
heat
of
the
dish
for
the
brief
time
that
it
is
on
your
tongue
then
after
you
swallow
the
heat
is
back
pours
a
deep
beautiful
ink
black
with
a
rather
active
espresso
colored
head
maximal
lacing
and
good
retention
smells
overtly
of
chocolate
and
coffee
this
is
shaping
up
nicely
taste
wise
it
is
a
home
run
huge
waves
of
coffee
slightly
burnt
and
chocolate
malt
enbalm
your
mouth
this
stuff
is
desert
and
thats
just
how
im
having
it
finshes
slightly
dry
with
a
nice
sweetly
astringent
quality
to
it
mouthfeel
is
rather
big
but
quite
enjoyable
god
help
me
if
i
ever
find
this
on
tap
rogue
chocolate
stout
was
served
from
a
22
oz
silkscreened
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
black
and
was
topped
by
an
ample
brown
head
that
eventually
receeded
leaving
pools
of
shimmering
obsidianlike
blackness
rich
aromas
of
cocoachocolate
cola
and
creamy
sasparilla
wafted
from
the
glass
integrated
with
a
superb
and
intriguing
roasty
smoky
earthiness
this
stout
delivered
divine
flavors
beginning
with
a
dark
chocolatecola
roasty
maltiness
that
opened
up
with
an
excellent
earthy
cocoa
bitterness
and
perfectly
subtle
nondescript
esters
the
finish
was
cocoa
dry
and
colalike
with
cherry
esters
leaving
lingering
bitter
chocolate
notes
yes
i
could
tell
there
is
some
real
chocolate
in
there
the
body
was
richly
full
and
smooth
perfect
for
the
flavors
and
character
of
the
beer
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
chocolate
stout
enjoying
it
immensely
in
contrast
to
the
shakespeare
which
i
think
is
a
bit
unrefined
and
outofwack
with
its
esters
being
a
lover
of
both
stouts
and
super
dark
chocolate
i
highly
recommend
this
one
to
other
likeminded
individuals
perhaps
my
favorite
from
rogue
drinkability
id
gladly
have
more
than
one
delicious
im
very
happy
to
have
found
it
on
tap
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
well
i
was
wrong
the
chocolate
is
there
in
the
taste
but
not
nearly
as
aggressive
as
in
the
aroma
and
it
is
quickly
balanced
by
smooth
dark
roasted
malt
with
some
nice
hoppiness
on
the
edge
the
beer
finishes
cleaner
than
any
stout
ive
ever
had
as
the
chocolate
shows
up
again
in
the
aftertaste
more
in
the
form
of
vanillin
perfectly
balancing
out
the
roastiness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
smooth
smooth
one
might
classify
this
as
a
dessert
beer
but
i
think
not
one
to
accompany
dessert
rather
it
is
dessert
sublime
i
dont
care
what
they
added
to
make
it
taste
this
delicious
i
just
hope
they
keep
on
brewing
it
if
ever
there
was
a
chocolate
beershake
this
is
it
if
that
strikes
some
as
heresy
then
ill
gladly
consume
their
share
rogue
chocolate
stout
is
in
my
opinion
the
definitive
chocolate
stout
and
the
one
by
which
all
others
will
now
be
measured
tremendous
stuff
pours
a
deep
viscous
dark
brown
color
which
no
light
can
escape
a
nice
thick
creamy
chocolatey
head
appears
and
stays
for
a
while
leaving
a
beautiful
lace
aromas
are
of
roasted
malts
coffee
cocoa
and
just
a
slight
light
hop
aroma
the
intially
taste
of
this
beer
starts
off
quite
roasty
and
chocolately
with
the
dark
malts
really
finding
their
way
into
this
brew
this
follows
with
a
nice
coffee
tone
with
hints
of
expresso
and
just
more
cocoa
this
beer
finishes
smooth
and
thick
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
and
yet
more
roasty
malts
as
for
mouthfeel
to
this
beer
there
arent
many
that
get
smoother
richer
or
creamier
than
this
beer
and
its
drinkability
is
just
as
good
to
boot
this
was
a
damn
fine
stout
and
my
favorite
of
the
rogues
ive
had
so
far
this
bottle
was
courtesy
of
frank4sail
who
brought
it
amongst
many
others
to
belgium
for
me
i
shared
it
with
belgianbeers
during
an
american
craftbrew
tasting
the
other
night
if
you
are
in
to
stouts
try
it
once
but
thats
about
all
you
need
to
do
with
this
beer
3
49
22
oz
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
beer
was
nearly
black
with
little
head
the
aroma
of
chocolate
was
immediately
evident
chocolate
bars
dont
smell
this
chocolately
sweet
aroma
and
a
slight
hop
backbone
were
detected
taste
was
outstanding
off
the
tap
this
beer
had
a
totally
different
characteristic
than
in
bottles
the
strong
malty
chocolate
was
balanced
by
a
carefully
tuned
hop
note
very
surprizing
in
this
style
very
agreeable
easy
on
the
palate
and
remarkably
easy
to
drink
for
a
heavy
fullbodied
stout
a
superb
brew
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
from
the
aroma
chocolate
flavor
is
present
and
prevalent
in
the
first
few
seconds
to
be
replaced
by
a
bitter
mouthfeel
that
lasts
through
the
finish
interesting
but
not
something
id
enjoy
on
a
daily
basis
sampled
31604
drinkability
for
me
is
good
i
couldnt
turn
this
into
a
session
beer
but
i
dont
really
do
too
many
of
those
anymore
this
is
a
wonderful
dessert
beer
campfire
beer
and
general
tounge
pleaser
the
only
detractor
is
that
it
would
overpower
some
meals
and
might
not
be
suitable
for
a
foodmatch
22oz
bomber
this
one
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
a
great
dark
brown
frothy
head
with
good
size
head
retention
is
good
and
it
leaves
a
nice
brown
lacing
about
the
glass
the
aroma
coming
of
this
one
is
of
heavy
chocolate
with
a
slight
floral
hoppiness
mingling
about
some
coffee
can
also
be
detected
in
the
smell
the
taste
was
excellent
all
the
great
qualities
of
a
stout
were
present
with
the
taste
of
dark
chocolate
it
seems
the
coffee
flavor
can
out
on
the
backside
as
an
after
taste
also
there
was
some
bitterness
present
mouthfeel
was
full
bodies
and
creamy
overall
all
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
the
chocolate
is
defiantly
there
but
no
overwhelming
this
second
half
of
the
bomber
went
great
with
some
good
dark
chocolate
highly
recommended
rogue
does
a
magnificent
job
again
man
this
beer
looks
wonderful
black
on
black
with
nice
brown
head
lots
of
rising
bubbles
with
good
lacing
smells
good
roasted
malts
with
big
chocolate
nose
slight
hint
of
coffee
and
oats
tastes
of
malt
flavored
chocolate
sweet
and
smooth
with
nice
hop
bite
that
leaves
your
tounge
wanting
more
cascade
hops
that
is
strange
for
a
stout
but
good
i
liked
this
beer
but
for
me
one
at
a
time
is
plenty
kind
of
like
a
good
moca
grande
like
one
now
and
then
but
drink
coffee
everyday
overall
this
brew
is
great
it
is
soo
very
chocolatey
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
buy
often
found
my
new
favorite
it
was
served
in
a
22
ounce
bottle
i
purposely
poured
it
to
get
a
nice
thick
head
on
it
it
was
pure
sweet
chocolate
brown
in
color
took
a
while
for
the
head
to
go
away
so
i
sipped
the
foam
tasted
like
dark
chocolate
toffee
a
spotty
lace
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
deep
earthy
malts
dark
chocolate
oatmeal
and
coffee
undertones
the
finish
is
superb
with
the
chocolate
rising
up
through
the
nose
this
is
my
frist
5
ever
the
taste
is
what
blows
me
away
sweet
yet
still
has
the
strong
stout
feel
to
it
i
give
this
beer
the
highest
ratings
i
possibly
can
bomber
bottle
pours

and
rich
engine
oil
heady
nose
of

and
expresso
creamy
smooth

notes
of

cholcoate
chocolate
cake
this
stuff
is
just
plain
yummy
great
dessert
beer
great
for
a
night
capper
classy
product
from
a
long
time
major
player
in
the
craft
brew
market
thanks
rogue
taste
is
overwhelmingly
of
dark
chocolate
and
bitter
coffee
as
you
might
expect
but
there
is
another
dimension
to
this
beer
and
thats
the
sweet
milkiness
that
reminds
you
of
a
milk
stout
mixed
with
the
chocolatecoffee
bitterness
the
creaminess
lends
a
bittersweet
quality
to
this
brew
again
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
but
still
very
smooth
really
luscious
and
easy
to
drink
fantastic
stout
the
smell
was
huge
lots
of
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
aroma
also
very
smooth
and
sweet
maltiness
the
taste
is
dominated
by
toffe
and
a
slight
bitterness
at
first
and
in
the
end
leaves
a
massive
burst
of
dark
chocolate
that
lingers
and
coats
the
mouth
drinkability
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
from
start
to
finish
and
would
buy
it
again
would
work
exceptionally
well
as
an
after
dinner
drink
in
smaller
portions
its
not
something
youd
want
to
quaff
several
glasses
of
unless
youre
really
into
chocolate
too
bad
ive
only
seen
rogue
chocolate
stout
in
650ml
bottles
black
as
night
with
a
very
thin
dark
tan
head
this
beer
even
looks
like
chocolate
the
smell
is
sweet
dark
malts
but
i
cant
really
pick
up
any
chocolate
aroma
specifically
oddly
the
more
i
smell
it
the
less
smell
my
nose
picks
up
as
the
beer
slides
onto
the
tongue
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
the
chocolate
doesnt
assert
itself
until
after
it
has
sat
on
the
tongue
for
a
bit
and
youre
ready
to
swallow
at
that
point
it
really
rears
back
and
smacks
makes
you
think
you
have
a
piece
of
dark
chocolate
in
your
mouth
i
detect
a
slight
metallic
taste
in
the
aftertaste
which
is
eversoslightly
offputting
drinkability
suffers
for
me
as
it
becomes
almost
sickingly
sweet
by
the
end
fo
the
glass
an
8
or
9
oz
serving
would
be
ideal
as
an
afterdinner
drink
but
a
22
oz
bomber
is
just
too
much
pours
a
beautiful
and
pitch
black
color
fairly
large
dark
tan
head
with
good
staying
power
and
good
lacing
smells
faintly
like
dark
chocolate
smooth
and
almost
creamy
lots
of
roasted
malts
and
hoppiness
a
very
tasty
stout
thats
full
of
chocolate
flavor
another
wonderful
brew
from
rogue
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
desert
beers
this
is
pure
chocolate
it
pours
a
nice
thick
black
with
a
very
creamy
tan
head
smell
is
full
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
taste
was
initially
super
chocolatey
but
later
other
flavors
came
out
to
play
i
get
faint
notes
of
coffee
and
a
general
roasted
flavor
out
of
this
as
well
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
great
as
this
is
thick
and
creamy
drinkability
suffers
a
little
as
just
1
of
these
leaves
me
completely
satiated
has
the
darkest
head
ive
ever
poured
albeit
somewhat
uneven
bubbles
chocolate
mocha
aroma
very
nice
thick
creamy
deep
roasted
flavor
a
very
moving
moment
hops
asserts
itself
beautifully
balanced
and
deeply
satisfying
this
is
what
id
hoped
to
experience
with
rogue
silky
and
velvety
on
the
tongue
and
all
the
way
down
wish
i
owned
a
case
or
two
extremely
fine
brussels
lace
rogue
claims
to
use
imported
chocolate
when
making
this
brew
and
it
must
be
said
it
is
done
with
a
restrained
hand
it
is
the
quintessential
chocolate
stout
a
rare
find
pitch
black
in
appearance
it
has
a
small
but
continuing
head
upon
smelling
a
roasty
cocoa
aroma
is
quite
evident
the
chocolate
was
pleasant
went
well
with
the
roasted
notes
but
was
not
overwelming
this
beer
has
strong
bitterness
that
does
not
dominate
but
works
well
with
the
roasty
chocolate
flavors
there
is
a
pleasant
finish
a
very
drinkable
stout
medium
bodied
at
best
packs
a
punch
in
terms
of
carbonation
which
i
suppose
is
for
the
better
otherwise
you
might
get
sick
of
the
burnt
sweets
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
really
sweet
id
like
to
drink
this
sitting
around
the
campfire
in
lew
of
eating
smores
22
oz
bomber
does
the
trick
for
me
overall
this
one
is
a
truly
remarkable
brew
if
you
do
see
this
one
pick
it
up
and
enjoy
it
it
is
worth
it
had
on
tap
at
redbones
pour
was
dark
as
night
low
head
dissipated
quickly
aroma
was
all
about
rich
chocolate
i
thought
the
taste
was
mostly
dark
chocolate
with
some
roasted
notes
a
very
nice
and
tasty
stout
that
does
exactly
what
was
expected
would
get
again
no
problems
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
pours
like
motor
oil
i
am
not
exagerating
at
whatsoever
thick
and
black
light
absorbing
with
the
darkest
brown
head
i
have
ever
seen
smells
like
guess
what
chocolate
i
work
at
a
bakery
and
it
smells
just
like
chocolate
hazelnut
bagels
sweet
and
smooth
smelling
taste
is
like
many
stouts
chocolate
and
coffee
but
you
can
definitely
taste
the
belgian
chocolate
i
think
that
was
used
to
make
this
stuff
i
cant
believe
how
much
like
bitter
chocolate
this
stuff
tastes
that
is
why
i
gave
it
a
5
it
tastes
exactly
like
the
style
it
was
shooting
for
very
delicious
dessert
beer
worthy
of
being
ranked
so
high
and
having
the
rogue
brand
name
notes
this
is
a
dessert
in
a
bottle
and
id
take
this
over
any
actual
dessert
any
day
a
very
smooth
yet
complex
brew
that
is
the
epitome
of
a
chocolate
brew
cheers
delivered
with
a
nice
head
on
top
of
a
dark
brownnear
black
brew
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
scream
out
at
the
nose
and
the
taste
buds
are
not
disappointed
bitterness
tempers
the
sweetness
excellently
almost
like
a
mouthful
of
bittersweet
chocolate
hearty
smooth
imminently
drinkable
get
it
if
you
can
blacks
as
night
with
a
thick
head
with
a
deep
brown
colour
heafty
brown
lace
around
my
glass
smells
of
sweet
malty
chocolate
blasted
with
sweet
chocolate
then
malt
leaves
me
with
a
bitter
chocolate
taste
very
chewy
like
taking
a
bite
of
a
top
notch
chocolate
bar
i
could
drink
this
everyday
all
day
for
the
rest
of
my
life
a
5
star
brew
from
rogue
this
is
a
tasty
brew
definitely
drinkable
near
perfect
for
after
dinner
rogue
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
this
is
an
awesome
stout
that
i
will
definitely
buy
again
try
it
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
dont
like
the
overt
chocolate
flavor
i
dont
think
chocolate
belongs
in
beer
except
youngs
double
chocolate
which
seems
to
be
much
less
overt
in
the
chocolate
department
but
i
know
they
add
chocolate
to
that
beer
in
the
rogue
beer
they
add
chocolate
flavoring
tastes
and
smells
like
nestlea
quik
to
me
actually
really
quite
an
artificial
tasting
beer
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
too
not
quite
sure
how
this
is
top
ranked
19
better
than
thomas
hardys
hennepin
celebration
man
crazyness
in
my
opinion
drinkability
a
rather
delicious
taste
treat
very
smooth
but
a
stronger
chocolate
presence
would
be
nice
pours
a
dark
almost
black
liquid
with
a
tan
foamy
almost
creamy
head
what
a
great
smell
of
bitter
chocolate
and
roasted
dark
malt
immediate
taste
is
of
the
roasted
malt
with
good
bitterness
then
it
hits
this
may
be
the
best
finish
of
a
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
finish
is
of
a
cocoa
powder
and
milk
chocolate
flavor
wow
this
beer
has
just
about
anything
you
could
ask
for
in
a
chocolate
stout
good
mouthfeel
maybe
not
a
great
session
beer
this
is
a
good
special
occasion
beer
another
winner
from
rogue
pours
a
deep
chocolateblack
opaque
in
the
glass
with
a
1
frothy
coffeemocha
head
chocolate
and
chicory
form
the
aroma
not
to
be
redundant
but
the
flavor
is
chocolate
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
reminiscent
of
bittersweet
chocolate
even
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
like
melted
say
it
with
me
chocolate
all
of
this
however
is
contained
within
the
context
of
a
very
satisfying
stout
you
like
chocolate
you
like
stouts
youll
love
this
you
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
all
night
but
as
a
treat
or
a
desert
beer
its
really
good
an
interesting
chocolate
offering
from
rogue
especially
for
those
who
appreciate
a
more
dry
chocolate
taste
this
is
something
id
likely
have
again
smells
simply
fantastic
i
enjoyed
my
last
few
sips
with
a
few
hershey
kisses
lying
around
here
what
a
fantastic
combination
or
maybe
the
taste
developed
because
of
the
alcohol
im
still
not
sure
how
much
was
in
the
bottle
i
feel
like
homer
simpson
right
now
mmm
chocolate
the
first
smell
after
opening
the
22
oz
bottle
was
a
bit
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
coffee
similar
to
the
shakespeare
stout
a
deeper
breath
and
the
smell
of
chocolate
broke
through
quite
clearly
when
poured
in
a
pint
glass
it
looked
the
part
with
an
opaque
brown
body
topped
with
a
rough
brown
head
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
presence
of
chocolate
because
of
the
strong
flavoring
other
tastes
are
a
bit
hard
to
distinguish
i
can
detect
a
bit
of
coffee
and
burnt
toast
quite
dry
and
a
tad
too
harsh
in
the
mouthfeel
department
i
think
it
left
me
wishing
for
more
maltyness
and
a
smoother
and
sweeter
body
this
is
definitely
not
to
be
chugged
but
sipped
and
allowed
to
coat
your
throat
and
tongue
as
it
goes
down
on
tap
at
isaac
newtons
inky
black
with
an
increidibly
dark
brown
bubbling
head
that
retreated
for
the
most
part
on
the
nose
oh
man
what
a
nose
this
had
to
be
one
of
the
best
smelling
flavored
stouts
ive
ever
come
across
deep
dark
milk
chocolate
covered
roasted
barley
smell
i
cant
stress
enough
how
good
this
beer
smells
a
tad
bit
too
much
carbonation
thins
out
medium
body
hints
of
chocolate
and
smoke
at
first
sip
followed
by
a
massive
roasted
flavor
and
quite
strong
for
the
style
leafy
hop
flavor
this
beer
smells
alot
more
chocolatey
than
it
tastes
a
great
sippin
brew
though
i
dont
think
that
id
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
a
must
try
awesome
pours
out
like
a
can
of
motor
oil
two
inch
dark
brown
head
not
unlike
the
top
of
a
chocolate
milk
shake
is
this
a
chocolate
milkshake
besides
the
chocolate
aroma
the
touch
of
hops
and
strong
malts
tell
me
that
this
is
in
fact
a
beer
taste
is
incredibly
smooth
big
malts
up
front
with
a
pronounced
hop
bitterness
in
the
middle
with
a
finish
of
sweet
chocolate
goodness
overall
flavor
is
almost
of
baking
chocolate
this
is
the
best
chocolate
beer
ive
had
yet
and
one
of
the
best
stouts
to
boot
having
had
it
many
times
over
a
few
years
i
find
it
amazing
how
consistant
this
beer
is
regardless
of
whether
it
is
served
on
tap
or
bottle
there
is
really
nothing
that
the
brewer
could
do
with
it
to
make
it
any
more
enjoyable
great
with
a
big
slab
of
chocolate
cake
for
dessert
oh
my
simply
put
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
from
a
bottle
anyhow
pours
black
as
an
accountants
soul
with
a
burnt
umber
shard
at
the
bottom
a
luxurious
frothy
cacao
colored
head
that
is
tenaciously
stubborn
tops
the
brew
and
gives
it
a
regal
look
the
smell
is
initially
sweet
like
hot
chocolate
before
moving
onto
more
bitter
toasted
notes
of
chocolate
and
creamed
coffee
the
taste
is
outlandishly
appealing
chocolate
upon
chocolate
with
the
hops
and
alcohol
more
apparent
when
warmed
it
is
sweeter
and
more
complex
not
to
mention
more
enjoyable
when
allowed
to
warm
a
bit
it
has
a
unique
finish
which
is
both
green
and
creamy
mouthfeel
is
great
chewy
complex
and
mildly
carbonated
perhaps
slightly
thin
for
the
style
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
drinkability
is
perhaps
a
little
too
good
more
drinkability
a
truly
drinkable
beer
that
has
changed
my
mind
about
stouts
the
chocolate
and
hop
balance
make
this
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
sampled
lately
the
creativeness
of
this
wonderful
brew
makes
me
proud
to
be
a
beer
drinker
im
not
sure
if
a
stout
can
look
ant
better
that
this
when
pouring
into
the
glass
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
large
frothy
tan
head
that
has
a
slight
cascading
effect
as
it
builds
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
into
a
perfect
dome
shape
the
head
lasts
a
long
time
slowly
receding
to
a
thick
frothy
lace
lots
of
chocolate
notes
on
the
nose
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
that
seem
earthy
in
nature
some
roasted
and
coffee
notes
also
play
in
but
are
intertwined
with
the
chocolate
character
this
brew
is
huge
in
the
flavor
department
and
really
hits
my
palate
the
right
way
roasted
notes
are
far
more
apparent
on
the
pallet
then
on
the
nose
theres
a
subtle
slightly
smooth
start
of
semi
sweet
dark
chocolate
that
is
followed
shortly
after
by
coffee
and
roasted
notes
a
slight
hint
of
milk
chocolate
comes
in
towards
the
middle
followed
by
and
soft
prickly
carbonation
good
hop
finish
that
is
again
a
bit
earthy
brings
a
nice
balance
roasted
and
coffee
notes
come
back
in
the
aftertaste
and
last
forever
forcing
me
to
draw
the
glass
back
up
for
another
sip
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
white
sediment
is
noticeable
as
it
collects
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
overall
mouth
feel
is
medium
and
is
smooth
yet
not
quite
so
smooth
due
to
the
roasted
notes
despite
this
the
brew
is
incredibly
drinkable
im
sorry
to
see
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
im
even
more
sorry
that
i
only
bought
two
bottles
an
outstanding
brew
exceptional
appearance
black
choclolate
creamy
head
chunky
and
leving
a
beautiful
lace
smell
hops
chocolate
malt
a
hint
of
coffee
all
in
their
definitely
invites
you
to
drink
taste
was
initially
slightly
sweet
leveling
off
at
mid
palate
and
ending
in
anice
hoppy
burst
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
dry
almost
astingent
in
the
finish
a
delight
for
malt
chocolate
and
hops
lovers
highly
revommend
a
most
drinkable
stout
nice
a
thick
pour
opaque
black
beer
the
head
is
dark
tanbrown
and
crusty
nice
spotty
lacing
the
nose
shows
off
plenty
of
dark
chocolate
but
no
possibility
of
hiding
the
cascades
yum
but
the
hops
are
almost
confined
to
the
aroma
the
beer
starts
with
sweet
chocolate
travels
through
a
thick
malty
chocolate
base
to
a
bitter
dark
chocolate
finish
this
is
a
very
tasty
chocolate
drink
the
cascades
in
the
nose
offset
the
chocolate
a
little
but
i
wouldnt
take
offense
if
somebody
called
this
beer
a
bit
onedimensional
comes
in
a
nice
22oz
bomber
damm
skippy
pours
a
black
gold
a
classical
stout
look
with
a
good
meaty
head
smell
is
of
malt
and
what
else
but
chocolate
taste
is
straight
up
solid
much
less
of
a
burnt
taste
is
there
though
still
quite
active
this
is
the
best
brew
to
ever
hit
the
chocolate
nail
on
the
head
bold
and
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
chocolate
stouts
out
there
this
is
dessert
in
a
bottle
it
poured
a
jet
black
color
with
a
dark
brown
head
that
settled
into
a
pillow
of
foam
after
about
1
min
the
smell
was
all
chocolate
just
like
sniffing
the
inside
of
a
truffle
the
taste
was
just
amazing
with
a
great
chocolate
sweetness
and
just
enough
hops
to
balance
out
the
flavor
this
is
one
that
could
be
enjoyed
with
cake
or
ice
cream
or
just
by
its
self
what
a
beer
what
the
hell
was
i
drinking
is
this
beer
who
cares
it
was
dark
with
a
chocolate
head
it
tasted
like
a
good
chocolate
truffle
not
a
cheap
one
but
like
a
dark
chocolate
lindt
it
was
so
yummy
the
perfect
dessert
i
find
myself
crazing
this
over
cake
or
ice
cream
masterfull
bomber
bottle
pours
black
as
pitch
with
a
thick
dark
tan
head
the
aromas
are
all
chocolate
not
the
syrupy
sweet
milk
chocolate
but
a
real
good
bitter
dark
baking
chocolate
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
with
a
keen
dry
hop
finish
the
the
cold
mouthfeel
contrasted
nicely
with
the
warm
chocolate
stout
flavors
dryness
increased
as
the
beer
warmed
good
stuff
but
couldnt
see
doing
more
than
the
one
bomber
dark
pitck
black
its
like
looking
into
the
nightmares
of
a
child
even
the
head
is
a
dark
tan
color
but
then
it
all
becomes
a
dream
the
everlasting
chocolate
smell
brings
me
back
to
my
childhood
its
like
unwrapping
a
symphony
dark
chocolate
bar
and
getting
that
magnificent
odor
the
taste
is
purely
chocolate
also
you
can
feel
it
melt
on
your
tongue
as
it
goes
down
no
beer
has
ever
brought
me
back
to
my
preteen
years
except
colt
45
but
that
is
a
different
story
another
a
for
rogue
good
times
very
nice
pours
jet
black
with
a
huge
tan
head
aroma
is
of
chocolate
chocolate
and
more
chocolate
also
sweet
malts
first
taste
that
hits
is
slightly
burnt
malts
then
some
bitterness
so
much
chocolate
dry
with
very
little
actual
sweetness
extremely
smooth
mouthfeel
with
just
a
bit
of
crispness
somewhat
oatmeal
stoutlike
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
brew
pours
the
colour
of
night
with
a
light
mocha
head
which
sat
and
lingered
like
froth
on
a
cappucino
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
almost
like
an
ovaltine
gone
adult
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
at
first
then
the
chocolate
slides
in
and
dominates
just
enough
hops
come
in
to
dry
out
the
palate
and
keep
everything
in
line
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
with
the
flavours
lingering
around
long
enough
to
keep
the
smile
on
your
face
drinkability
is
good
although
they
could
fill
you
up
quick
overall
a
killer
chocolate
beer
i
give
it
the
edge
over
the
sam
adams
chocolate
bock
because
the
chocolate
character
is
more
subtle
and
refined
a
fantastic
beer
and
a
very
unique
flavored
stout
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
even
though
it
lightened
the
wallet
a
little
pours
with
a
thick
darkish
brown
head
quite
black
in
color
the
head
is
so
meringue
like
that
i
take
a
bite
of
it
the
head
is
like
biting
into
the
lightest
fluffiest
slightly
sweet
chocolate
mousse
the
aroma
is
strongly
of
chocolate
it
dominates
the
aroma
of
this
beer
quite
a
creamy
body
lightly
sweet
as
well
this
beer
finishes
with
a
bit
of
dark
malt
and
a
subdued
bitterness
just
like
the
aroma
the
chocolate
is
dominant
in
the
taste
of
the
beer
as
well
it
is
like
eating
a
dense
rich
creamy
chocolate
dessert
that
is
only
lightly
sweet
very
good
though
i
must
say
that
it
seems
a
bit
onedimensional
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
thin
but
lasting
head
the
nose
is
of
chocolate
and
little
spicy
perhaps
cinnamon
the
69
ibus
are
amply
balanced
by
the
malts
chocolate
and
oats
mellow
it
even
further
although
the
hops
may
a
play
for
dominance
in
the
finish
chocoholics
rejoice
i
like
chocolate
and
i
like
this
beer
no
hints
here
it
is
what
it
is
and
thats
a
thick
rich
robust
stout
to
make
willy
wonka
proud
the
heft
and
abv
limit
this
to
mostly
singular
indulgences
but
that
one
ok
maybe
two
goes
down
smooth
and
with
gustatorial
delight
nestles
quik
has
always
been
a
downhome
comfort
drink
for
me
now
that
im
a
big
boy
this
beer
will
take
that
role
in
a
nutshell
youd
have
to
hate
chocolate
not
to
like
this
beer
this
is
a
defining
beer
for
the
style
rogue
just
keeps
proving
itself
650
ml
bottle
pours
an
opaque
deep
brownalmost
black
with
an
honesttogoodness
light
brown
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
eventually
giving
way
to
ring
and
sheet
cocoa
lacing
big
aroma
of
chocolate
irish
cream
coffee
and
burnt
smoky
malts
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
carbonation
doesnt
bite
but
its
there
taste
is
chocolate
roasted
and
caramelized
smokiness
is
noticeable
cascade
hops
peep
in
but
the
dutch
chocolate
drives
them
away
damn
this
stuff
has
an
overwhelming
taste
i
dont
know
how
any
other
stout
can
claim
to
be
a
chocolate
stout
standing
against
this
one
excellent
product
here
and
i
love
it
really
close
to
liquid
food
intense
flavor
and
heavy
mouthfeel
detract
from
the
overall
drinkability
of
this
beer
the
single
22oz
bottle
was
enough
to
leave
me
burned
out
on
chocolate
and
feeling
stuffed
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
bodied
subtle
coffee
and
bitterness
linger
on
the
tongue
behind
the
chocolate
well
into
the
aftertaste
the
drinkability
is
knocked
down
a
notch
because
after
finishing
the
bomber
bottle
i
felt
like
i
ate
the
several
whole
chocolate
bars
and
i
had
enough
for
this
sitting
i
consider
this
a
chocolate
meal
i
think
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
something
cause
i
got
no
choclate
in
this
whole
beer
the
most
i
got
was
a
heavy
bite
from
hops
which
i
dont
care
for
too
much
i
have
had
the
brooklyn
chocolate
stout
and
that
blows
this
one
away
as
far
as
balanced
out
malts
and
hops
as
well
as
taste
this
one
was
way
too
hoppy
for
me
and
had
little
balance
i
got
very
little
malts
in
it
at
all
which
was
a
huge
let
down
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
for
me
was
the
apperance
this
is
simply
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
you
will
ever
see
nice
head
retention
and
super
dark
color
the
color
was
so
beautiful
i
couldnt
see
through
it
so
thats
a
plus
in
my
book
other
than
that
this
was
below
average
as
far
as
chocolate
stouts
go
i
couldnt
finish
the
bomber
and
that
says
a
lot
to
me
very
easy
to
drink
the
only
problem
is
i
think
id
burn
out
on
the
chocolate
after
awhile
not
a
fault
drinkability

a
perfect
nightcap
this
would
go
well
with
burnt
crème
or
crème
brulee
drinkability
highly
drinkable
willy
shakes
gone
swiss
miss
rivals
youngs
double
chocolate
but
a
tad
more
bitter
and
not
as
silky
smooth
3

a
bomber
dark
cola
colored
head
was
solid
the
beer
was
dark
as
hell
light
absorbing
and
whatnot
it
reaked
of
chocolate
like
a
bottle
of
chocolate
syrup
the
body
was
middle
of
the
road
which
is
good
because
i
didnt
feel
like
actually
drinking
a
bottle
of
syrup
the
taste
was
all
stout
not
nearly
as
much
chocolate
as
in
the
aroma
and
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
i
just
thought
the
chocolate
in
the
aroma
was
overbearing
and
a
little
artificial
black
motor
oil
stout
with
a
huge
rocky
head
that
lasts
for
days
huge
chocolate
aroma
with
a
good
hop
backbone
the
flavor
is
chocolate
and
coffee
with
hop
bitterness
behind
the
finish
is
bitter
chocolate
and
dry
full
body
beer
with
good
drinkability
tasted
blind
at
the
121403
st
louis
ba
tasting
one
of
the
more
disappointing
rogue
brews
ive
tried
the
taste
on
this
beer
is
just
not
on
mark
for
such
a
proud
name
the
slightly
thin
body
provides
a
flavor
that
is
just
weak
and
quite
short
of
stout
strength
dark
as
night
this
beer
had
a
small
nondescript
head
and
little
lace
effect
truly
short
of
chocolate
sense
as
well
but
long
on
a
thin
malt
sense
drinkability
not
at
all
excited
about
this
one
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
imo
wont
try
again
we
tried
this
with
a
piece
of
death
by
chocolate
cake
from
gregs
restaurant
in
providence
rimaking
for
a
great
combination
this
stout
definitely
deserves
its
high
ranking
tastes
exceptional
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
on
this
but
it
seemed
like
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
will
surely
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
in
the
coming
weeks
im
astounded
at
how
much
chocolate
flavor
and
aroma
is
crammed
into
this
beer
its
not
a
beer
its
like
a
dark
chocolate
mousse
that
got
liquified
unbelievably
drinkable
try
to
restrain
yourself
from
guzzling
it
all
before
it
has
a
chance
to
warm
up
some
appearance
ebony
just
barely
letting
any
ruby
highlights
through
at
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
seems
viscous
with
the
pour
and
forms
a
nice
sized
milk
chocolate
colored
brown
head
leves
behind
beautiful
uniformed
webbed
lacing
aroma
hints
of
roasted
marshmallows
deep
milky
chocolate
toasted
nuts
just
one
heavenly
aroma
barely
letting
some
floral
notes
of
hops
taste
ladies
and
gents
what
a
beer
this
one
is
definitely
worthy
of
the
best
of
ba
with
dark
roasts
blending
with
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
upfront
the
beer
is
full
of
toasted
nuts
and
chocolate
pleasure
nothing
compares
to
this
one
just
awesome
i
like
brooklyns
luxury
double
chocolate
and
youngs
as
well
but
this
one
kicks
up
a
notch
in
the
right
direction
mouthfeel
full
bodied
almost
chewy
definitely
pours
like
motor
oil
this
is
one
big
brew
awesome
drinkability
limit
yourself
to
bomber
this
stuff
is
flavorful
and
full
in
body
as
lucious
as
they
come
an
experience
that
i
am
going
to
enjoy
for
the
next
30
to
60
minutes
just
sipping
on
it
this
was
a
great
dessert
on
thanksgiving
too
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
you
will
not
want
to
serve
too
cold
it
just
got
better
and
better
as
it
warmed
chocolate
stout
pours
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
and
great
lacing
it
smells
of
chocolate
chocolate
and
more
chocolate
very
rich
creamy
and
absolutely
delicious
when
i
first
tasted
this
beer
i
was
amazed
how
they
could
pack
so
much
chocolate
into
one
beer
an
utter
joy
from
the
tap
this
beer
poured
out
an
amazingly
rich
and
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
creamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
rich
with
roasted
tones
and
what
else
chocolate
theres
no
mistaking
it
this
beer
incorporates
the
chocolate
flavor
into
the
beer
perfectly
sweet
cocoa
comes
through
along
side
a
semisweet
body
of
malts
theres
a
hop
bitterness
hiding
in
there
also
this
is
a
special
beer
jet
black
in
appearance
with
a
thick
tan
head
aroma
of
chocoalate
liquor
taste
is
of
dark
chocolate
not
overly
sweet
a
bit
of
a
roasty
quality
reminds
you
that
yes
this
is
a
stout
youre
drinking
and
not
dessert
thick
silky
mouthfeel
gets
better
as
it
warms
excellent
use
of
chocolate
poured
with
a
somewhat
substantial
chocolate
soda
head
for
a
stout
had
a
chocolately
malt
aroma
a
chocolate
frosting
first
taste
with
a
pleasant
not
supersweet
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
thick
but
not
chewy
got
thicker
and
bolder
as
it
warmed
for
what
it
is
its
top
notch
but
to
one
dimensional
to
be
placed
amongst
the
top
world
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
for
my
liking
but
ill
live
drinkability
im
pretty
sure
i
could
polish
off
two
or
three
of
these
in
a
night
good
but
not
as
good
as
shakespeare
but
then
again
what
is
rogue
set
themselves
an
impossible
standard
with
that
one
compared
to
the
draft
version
see
my
review
the
differences
i
notice
in
the
bottled
version
are
1there
is
a
hint
of
nutmeg
or
ginger
towards
the
middle
its
slightly
spicier
but
in
a
herbal
fashion
2the
chocolate
flavor
and
aroma
is
more
subdued
3
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
denser
silken
and
smooth
but
not
quite
as
soft
this
is
still
my
favorite
chocolate
stout
however
the
draft
was
a
pure
pint
of
heaven
overall
impression
a
smooth
clean
tasting
beer
with
a
chocolate
twist
the
chocolate
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
a
nice
counterpoint
to
a
typically
for
rogue
delicious
stout
there
is
more
of
the
chocolate
in
the
nose
than
the
taste
but
its
all
good
makes
me
want
to
try
more
chocolate
in
my
homebrews
drinkability
is
great
i
had
trouble
writing
the
review
between
sips
the
nice
dry
finish
invites
another
mouthful
recommended
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
for
dinner
party
desserts
rogue
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
again
this
is
a
damn
fine
brew
pours
black
as
hell
with
a
dark
tan
foamy
head
that
is
oh
so
creamy
looking
there
is
an
obvious
sweet
chocolate
smell
that
dominates
with
a
bit
of
maltiness
as
well
it
smells
and
tastes
a
bit
like
chocolate
milk
the
chocolate
is
more
dominant
in
the
flavour
than
the
smell
which
was
maybe
the
only
drawback
for
me
with
this
beer
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
at
times
if
that
was
toned
down
a
bit
this
would
be
that
much
better
of
a
beer
very
creamy
and
smooth
and
just
enjoyable
all
around
a
big
and
thick
black
pour
generates
a
decent
and
creamy
tannish
head
thats
slightly
more
even
in
color
than
shakespeare
nice
intricate
lacing
properties
aroma
is
too
tipped
toward
chocolate
to
my
mind
quite
strong
and
unidimensional
excellent
body
mouthfeel
and
proper
carbonation
but
like
the
smell
the
malt
flavors
and
sweetness
leans
too
far
to
the
chocolate
side
for
my
everyday
tastes
just
a
slight
coffee
compensates
just
when
you
think
this
is
going
to
be
a
youngs
luxury
double
on
steroids
the
famed
rogue
hopping
balances
very
well
and
brings
the
close
and
after
sensation
about
a
good
beer
for
the
right
mood
it
just
lacks
the
slightly
more
masterful
complexity
and
outstanding
balance
of
rogue
shakespeare
stout
still
the
finest
beer
on
the
planet
in
so
many
characteristics
more
than
one
pint
of
chocolate
stout
at
a
time
gets
very
cloying
for
me
the
pour
was
black
and
i
couldnt
see
through
it
head
was
tan
but
pretty
weak
and
faded
fast
nice
lacing
though
smell
was
of
a
cocoa
flavor
taste
was
strong
intense
flavors
came
through
lots
of
chocolate
but
not
really
sweet
chocolate
more
bitter
chocolate
flavor
another
flavor
was
a
woody
flavor
that
complemented
the
chocolate
nicely
mixture
of
sweetness
and
hoppiness
stayed
balanced
throughout
very
roasted
feel
in
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
a
medium
to
thick
body
here

it

in

until
i
tried
this
this

a
dark

a
thick

as
with
the
rogue
shakespeare
stout
i
find
the
chocolate
flavor
to
be
ideal
strong
enough
to
know
its
chocolate
but
without
tasting
artificial
or
being
overbearing
as
to
ruin
the
stout
taste
a
thick
hanging
tonguecoating
mouthfeel
with
an
aftertaste
that
follows
the
initial
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
through
it
is
somewhat
pricey
but
after
drinking
many
good
stouts
this
one
is
very
memorable
with
the
ideal
amount
of
chocolate
unlike
flavored
coffees
that
taste
gimmicky
or
artificial
this
is
an
ideal
blend
of
stout
and
chocolate
flavors
like
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
its
a
bit
gimicky
sweet
vanilla
and
chocolate
flavour
to
start
off
with
the
finish
is
quite
roasty
with
some
bitter
chocolate
and
then
the
mandatory
hoppyness
of
rogue
beers
kicks
in
it
had
lots
of
flavour
and
i
quite
enjoyed
it

im
not
quite
sure

knew

to
go

sweet

bitter

all
kinds
of
chocolate
flavors
milk
dark
and
some
coffee
in
the
bitter

this
beer
redefines
full
bodied
with
an
amazing
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
that
reminds
me
of
drinking
some
good
homemade
hot
chocolate
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
reminds
you
that
brewing
is
an
art
form
on
second
tasting
a
week
or
too
later
i
had
to
lower
my
review
this
is
a
suboptimal
beer
this
beer
pours
almost
black
there
was
a
bit
of
a
dark
tan
head
the
aroma
is
almost
like
taking
a
whiff
of
a
hersheys
bar
definitely
too
much
chocolate
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
chocolate
bar
is
a
glass
they
have
gone
a
bit
too
far
with
this
one
its
not
bad
but
hard
to
finish
more
than
1
if
i
want
a
chocolate
bar
id
prefer
to
eat
one
another
spectacular
beer
from
rogue
this
bottled
beer
is
one
that
i
could
drink
exclusively
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
the
draft
is
even
better
deep
brown
color
with
reddish
highights
topped
by
a
nice
brown
head
that
shows
good
retention
as
it
slowly
fades
to
a
rocky
layer
of
foam
aroma
is
sweet
with
roasted
notes
and
good
chocolate
scents
but
theres
also
a
good
hop
component
as
well
the
taste
is
very
good
with
sweet
malt
and
dark
chocloate
notes
surrounding
a
slightly
fruity
note
then
a
great
coffee
flavor
sweeps
in
accompanied
by
a
blast
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
lingering
aftertaste
is
a
lot
like
eating
dark
chocolate
cake
with
raspberries
and
then
chasing
it
with
an
irish
coffee
it
surprising
how
much
the
chocolate
flavors
show
through
as
this
is
not
a
one
dimensional
beer
at
all
much
more
chocolate
than
youngs
double
chocolate
and
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
of
everything
else
as
well
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
had
passed
by
a
few
times
not
wanting
to
pay
the
pa
premium
but
im
glad
i
finally
got
a
bottle
last
month
this
is
a
great
beer
truly
deserving
of
its
praise
now
if
i
could
only
get
this
much
chocolate
taste
in
a
beer
without
the
complimenting
and
great
bitterness
maybe
i
could
get
my
wife
to
have
a
brew
a
must
buy
worth
the
price
you
pay

hops
is
there
along
with
the
roasted
malt
and
coffee
taste
is
chocolatey
good
lots
of
good
roasted
coffee
flavor
in
there
as
well
this
is
one
very
good
drinking
beer
i
could
very
easily
sit
and
drink
this
all
night
rogue
does
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
brown
head
that
lasts
the
aroma
is
rich
and
sweet
it
smells
like
a
chocolate
bar
there
is
a
heavy
presence
of
dark
malts
mostly
chocolate
the
taste
is
good
but
a
little
too
rich
there
is
a
taste
of
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
this
is
a
heavy
bodied
beer
its
well
carbonated
and
very
smooth
this
beer
drinks
very
well
definately
a
good
sessions
beer
one
of
the
best
beers
period
in
my
opinion
a
must
try
for
any
stout
lover
it
is
pretty
much
true
to
its
name
but
ill
describe
my
thoughts
of
the
brew
anyway
this
one
pours
thick
and
is
a
black
hole
of
a
brew
a
nice
thin
light
brown
head
caps
it
off
smell
is
chocolate
and
roasty
and
oh
yeah
chocolate
taste
is
exceptional
very
chocolaty
perhaps
slight
hints
of
coffee
but
mainly
chocolate
and
more
chocolate
a
thick
and
smooth
mouthfeel
easy
on
the
palate
this
one
is
a
little
thick
to
drink
too
many
but
thats
a
good
thing
in
my
book
nonetheless
i
usually
limit
myself
to
one
of
these
at
a
sitting
a
delicious
brew
at
the
brewery
this
stout
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
smell
of
chocolate
is
wat
i
can
discribe
as
being
outstanding
the
taste
was
of
a
bittersweet
nature
and
the
chocolate
flavor
filled
the
mouth
and
palate
the
finish
was
bitter
but
oh
so
good
and
very
pleasant
those
initial
unpleasant
flavors
lowered
this
review
for
me
ill
have
to
try
it
again
in
the
future
granted
this
is
a
chocolate
stout
but
the
chocolate
is
way
too
overpowering
a
complex
well
crafted
brew
but
the
over
the
top
chocolate
and
spices
just
arent
for
me
it
was
like
trying
to
drink
a
melted
hershey
bar
i
couldnt
finish
it
wow
what
a
appetizing
beerpoures
a
ddep
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
creamy
headthe
aroma
is
of
biiter
chocolate
and
powdered
sugar
flavor
is
malty
sweet
and
of
course
chocolaty
nice
and
creamy
tasting
with
a
nice
sweet
finish
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
had
in
some
time
looks
like
chocolate
smells
like
chocolate
tastes
like
chocolate
i
almost
forgot
this
is
beer
this
is
good
beer
pours
a
beautiful
opaque
with
very
brown
high
head
the
head
even
tastes
like
chocolate
not
sure
if
the
taste
is
bitter
chocolate
bar
or
cocoa
right
out
of
the
can
i
drank
this
at
about
5055f
somewhat
dry
finish
yet
creamy
the
taste
sticks
around
no
need
to
hurry
enjoy
the
only
thing
that
held
the
score
down
was
a
momentary
different
taste
right
when
you
take
a
sip
also
readily
available
rogue
brewery
is
one
of
the
top
brewrys
in
the
u
s
drinkability
i
enjoy
fine
chocolate
as
it
is
valrhona
noir
amer
being
one
of
my
favorites
and
callebaut
this
beer
is
so
deliciously
chocolaty
i
could
sip
it
all
night
long
its
just
too
good
to
stay
away
from
this
is
the
desert
beer
so
sweet
but
it
retained
all
its
stout
like
qualities
and
was
never
overwhelmed
by
the
chocolate
poured
stout
black
with
a
ruddy
tan
head
the
smell
was
initially
dominated
by
sweet
chocolates
and
was
rounded
out
by
mollasses
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
was
tons
of
meaty
deep
smooth
chocolates
and
caramel
with
a
malty
middle
and
a
huge
rogue
like
hop
finish
with
plenty
of
bitterness
kind
of
like
shakespeare
stout
with
chocolate
overall
i
was
impressed
ive
had
several
rogue
beers
now
and
have
liked
all
of
them
including
the
hazelnut
brown
nectar
and
dead
guy
but
this
one
blew
me
away
definately
a
beer
first
but
the
chocolate
flavor
is
definately
there
thanx
to
liquid
solutions
for
this
one
had
to
order
it
because
i
cant
find
it
anywhere
around
me
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
though
excellent
as
much
as
a
chocolate
flavor
as
any
other
and
a
nice
balance
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
this
may
be
the
best
rogue
ive
had
for
once
the
hops
dont
dominate
nice
body
appearance
is
as
it
should
be
good
head
retention
lacing
throughout
tastes
like
a
hershey
bar
had
it
along
with
youngs
double
chocolate
and
i
would
give
rogue
the
nod
thanks
to
weefisheads
for
the
bottles
i
had
this
one
in
a
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
black
with
1
finger
of
dark
tan
head
there
is
just
minimal
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
rich
in
cocoa
and
molasses
there
is
a
hint
of
hop
aroma
also
the
taste
is
full
of
chocolate
with
some
coffee
and
toffee
undertones
it
is
exceptionally
smooth
also
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
heavy
and
just
a
little
bubbly
the
drinkability
is
also
fairly
good
for
this
fine
dessert
beer
pours
ink
black
with
a
tall
pillowy
tan
colored
head
that
very
slowly
dissipates
leaving
spider
webs
of
lace
across
the
sides
of
the
glass
nose
is
milk
chocolate
and
fresh
cocoa
and
is
very
inviting
full
in
body
with
a
very
creamy
mouth
feel
taste
is
sweet
roasted
malts
and
dark
fruit
followed
by
tons
of
bittersweet
chocolate
with
notes
of
unsweetened
dark
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
a
marvelous
brew
and
a
perfect
choice
as
a
dessert
drink
thanks
to
loki
for
the
sample
truly
a
masterpiece
of
the
brewers
art
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
but
seeing
that
im
a
ba
and
a
chocaholic
i
could
drink
this
delightful
concoction
any
time
anywhere
double
your
pleasure
double
your
black
black
pout
huge
broze
head
the
nose
was
chocolatey
but
not
sweet
the
taste
was
heavenly
rich
with
cholcolate
both
dark
and
unsweetened
a
nice
bitterness
but
not
so
much
that
it
takes
away
from
the
chocolatley
treat
somewhat
creamy
a
nice
rich
finish
that
lingers
long
after
this
is
what
a
chocolate
stout
should
be
a
true
classic
of
the
style
and
of
the
overall
beer
world
mediumhigh
body
with
decent
but
not
great
mouthfeel
a
beautiful
chocolate
stout
and
a
chocolate
lovers
wet
dream
inky
black
liquid
with
a
small
but
dark
mahogany
colored
head
the
head
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
but
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
distinctly
of
chocolate
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
toffee
the
chocolate
flavor
is
just
right
slightly
understated
not
overdone
or
overpowering
at
all
and
it
doesnt
fight
with
the
fine
hop
bitterness
smooth
and
wellrounded

pretty
drinkable

into
another

full

flavors
and
a
snap
of

make
it
taste
like
bittersweet
chocolate
chips
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
to
date
just
plain
incredible
dark
godiva
chocolate
brown
and
thick
with
a
dark
froth
aroma
is
distinctly
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
a
little
earthy
very
smooth
like
most
good
stouts
and
creamy
as
well
hop
flavors
are
present
but
in
the
background
and
flavor
is
full
this
is
a
very
good
stout
and
im
continually
impressed
by
the
high
quality
brews
from
rogue
bottom
line
another
fine
example
of
rogues
constant
innovation
better
than
most
chocolate
stouts
but
i
am
still
having
a
tough
time
getting
chocolate
and
coffee
to
taste
good
together
dont
get
me
wrong
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
like
a
bit
more
stout
this
beer
is
fairly
rich
in
flavor
but
not
thick
in
flow
easy
to
drink
and
it
has
a
distinct
hint
of
chocolate
but
it
is
slightly
tart
as
though
there
are
grapes
or
something
hidden
in
the
shaddows
very
enjoyable
beer
but
the
aftertaste
is
very
undesireable
cheers
if
you
want
chocolate
this
is
the
beer
quite
tasty
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
with
a
quickly
diminishing
small
creamy
tan
head
which
leaves
a
minimum
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
and
full
of
dark
bakers
chocolate
flavor
is
similar
with
dark
maybe
a
semisweet
bakers
chocolate
being
dominant
and
a
hint
of
hops
bitterness
in
the
end
body
is
smooth
creamy
and
slick
goes
down
quite
easy

with

or
maybe
by
itself
for
desert
cheers
to
sakaroo
for
the
sample
its
inkyblack
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
leaves
lace
down
the
glass
as
soon
as
the
smell
hits
the
nose
you
know
youre
in
for
a
treat
chocolate
and
oats
with
a
fair
dose
of
hops
blend
together
very
nicely
leaving
you
in
serious
anticipation
of
the
first
drink
as
a
chocolate
lover
im
certainly
biased
but
the
flavor
is
fantastic
the
chocolate
is
more
akin
to
semisweet
baking
chololate
than
the
milk
chocolate
commonly
used
in
desserts
however
it
does
make
a
wonderful
dessert
beer
i
enjoyed
this
after
a
big
plate
of
spaghetti
with
italian
sausage
and
was
ready
to
loosen
my
belt
and
take
a
nap
chocolate
and
beer
in
almost
perfect
combinationthis
is
life
as
it
should
be
just
awesome
in
every
way
pours

luscious
black
color
with
a
thick
dark
beige

well

mediumbodied
with
a
nice
bitter
dark
chocolate
taste
throughout
along
with
malt
and
caramel
the
finish
is
lightly
hopped
but
has
a
sweet
aspect
as
well
i
am
surprised
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
any
technical
knowledge
i
can
pretend
to
fails
me
and
with
a
very
good
reason
this
was
the
third
and
largest
sample
in
my
trio
of
chocolate
stout
tastings
i
may
have
gone
overboard
damn
this
is
good
a
large
dark
brown
head
on
the
pour
and
the
beer
itself
is
black
a
coal
even
when
head
up
to
the
light
there
is
no
color
change
as
implied
by
the
name
there
is
a
nice
taste
of
chocolate
in
this
drink
ive
never
had
a
chocolate
beer
before
so
i
cant
compare
to
others
but
if
you
run
across
this
in
the
store
i
would
definately
recommend
it

chocolate
is
a
delicious
rich

i
prefer
my
willy
shakes
unadulterated
since
the
chocolate
character
muted
the
hop
and
roasted
grain
profile
a
highly
enjoyable
treat
nonetheless
i
really
like
this
beer
and
i
think
most
people
will
agree
with
me
a
pretty
dark
stout
color
with
a
strong
mocha
colored
head
the
lace
thin
but
very
strong
and
stained
the
glass
big
time
as
i
drank
the
brew
down
very
nice
to
look
at
nose
was
guess
chocolate
candied
sugar
caramel
nougat
and
a
little
rumlike
ester
all
were
appetizing
to
smell
but
none
were
presented
or
combined
in
an
impressive
way
taste
was
guess
chocolate
and
candied
sugar
had
a
dry
hoppy
finish
but
of
the
bitter
sort
youd
find
in
good
chocolate
even
better
was
its
almost
fruity
espresso
flavors
in
the
middle
of
its
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
a
fizz
that
came
from
the
head
and
hops
a
very
straightforward
beer
but
by
no
means
boring
and
one
of
the
better
stouts
out
of
the
six
famous
and
beeradvocate
highlyranked
ones
ive
had
recently
simple
and
simply
edible
this
is
a
tasty
stout
i
am
welcome
to
return
to
with
a
way
too
easy
mouthfeel
and
skilled
brewing
its
a
beer
version
of
milk
chocolate
the
was
first
taste
of
rogues
version
of
a
chocolate
stout
and
it
wont
be
my
last
bought
a
22
oz
bomber
of
this
to
help
me
get
in
the
mood
to
study
for
me
midterm
tomorrow
something
about
that
didnt
sound
right
hmm
poured
a
oily
jet
black
and
produced
a
very
large
very
thick
creamy
brown
head
left
lace
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
dominated
by
cocoa
with
small
hints
of
roasted
coffee
the
first
sip
is
always
the
best
with
any
chocolate
stout
and
this
one
didnt
let
me
down
somewhat
higher
carbonation
relative
to
others
i
have
tried
the
overall
taste
was
of
rich
chocolate
fighting
with
the
hops
for
mouth
domination
thats
how
i
would
describe
it
in
the
end
they
both
live
in
peace
blending
into
a
bittersweet
chocolate
finish
and
we
all
lived
happily
ever
after
time
to
study
what
can
i
say
the
name
says
it
all
chocolate
chocolate
and
more
chocolate
its
like
having
a
thin
chocolate
shake
it
pours
a
dark
used
motor
oil
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
disappears
all
too
soon
the
smell
takes
me
back
to
a
childhood
of
quaffing
chocolate
carnation
instant
breakfast
before
rushing
off
to
school
if
only
i
had
been
drinking
this
instead
classes
wouldve
been
oh
so
much
more
enjoyable
the
flavors
come
in
waves
first
there
is
a
quick
muted
blast
of
citrus
then
wave
after
wave
of
chocolate
first
sweet
and
creamy
then
bittersweet
the
finish
leaves
you
with
a
bit
of
roast
barley
bitterness
the
moutfeel
is
quite
smooth
more
like
a
dry
stout
good
stuff
though
between
the
two
id
choose
shakespeare
stout
tried
this
stout
thanks
to
gusler
it
pours
a
dark
black
colour
topped
by
a
creamy
tanned
head
aroma
consists
of
chocolate
with
hints
of
malt
and
coffee
strong
dark
chocolate
dominates
the
taste
an
excellent
beer
the
only
disadvantage
is
that
its
a
bit
poor
on
the
drinkability
point
of
view
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
1
liter
in
one
go
i
like
the
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
i
could
recommend
it
given
that
its
the
kind
of
beer
some
might
really
dislike
the
chocolate
flavours
are
so
strong
that
its
almost
not
even
a
beer
but
rather
some
sort
of
chocolate
desert
malt
beverage
simply
put
excellent
i
need
not
say
more
pours
black
with
a
brown
frothy
head
at
first
dark
then
a
lighter
shade
settles
into
a
guinnessstyle
thick
table
top
aroma
is
rich
chocolate
oh
wow
taste
starts
off
with
roasted
malt
a
thin
but
respectable
layer
of
hops
and
finishes
with
enough
chocolate
to
make
you
feel
you
had
a
melting
hersheys
kiss
in
your
mouth
when
you
drank
and
with
signature
oatmeal
notes
mixed
in
definitely
an
oatmeal
stout
at
the
bottom
of
this
specialty
thick
lush
and
smooth
across
the
tongue
had
this
a
couple
years
ago
and
thought
the
chocolate
was
way
over
the
top
but
it
is
far
more
balanced
now
an
exceptional
dessert
beer
nightcapper
this
brew
was
all
black
with
very
tan
creamy
head
that
diminshed
into
a
thin
layer
with
excellent
lacing
this
brew
just
looks
creamy
smooth
the
smell
is
all
rich
chocolate
with
a
slightly
bitter
tinge
the
taste
again
is
all
chocolate
big
surprise
there
even
though
there
is
a
lightly
bitter
finish
which
gives
this
brew
an
excellent
balance
if
it
wasnt
for
the
bitter
end
it
would
be
too
sweet
this
is
my
new
favorite
stout
especially
for
dessert
i
used
this
brew
to
top
of
a
steak
and
it
was
excellent
i
really
didnt
think
that
i
would
like
this
beer
i
figured
that
it
would
be
either
too
sweet
or
just
taste
like
a
cheap
flavored
beer
i
should
have
known
better
considering
this
brew
comes
from
rogue
they
did
a
great
job
of
creating
a
mellow
chocolate
stout
without
slapping
you
in
the
face
with
the
flavor
instead
of
seeming
artificial
it
just
seems
right
slick
stick
to
the
shakespeare
i
tried
this
and
i
must
say
that
i
dont
like
it
stouts
are
some
of
my
favorite
brews
but
not
this
stout
its
like
rogue
took
their
awesome
shakespeare
brew
and
spiked
it
will
yucky
chocolate
this
tastes
way
too
chocolate
there
are
other
flavors
going
around
in
there
but
the
chocolate
overpowers
i
can
see
how
some
could
like
this
but
i
do
not
i
am
definately
running
back
to
my
store
and
buying
a
few
more
bottles
to
stow
away
for
later
mmm
one
of
the
better
chocolate
stouts
rogue
has
found
that
secret
passage
that
leads
chocolate
to
beer
and
meshes
them
together
so
perfectly
i
love
this
beer
went
to
andys
corner
in
bogota
to
hear
that
it
was
here
the
first
keg
to
hit
nj
sounded
too
good
to
be
true
fortunately
it
wasnt
this
beer
smells
fantastic
has
a
great
look
and
feel
to
it
pours
with
a
great
head
and
tastes
just
like
heaven
willie
wonka
and
sam
smith
couldnt
team
up
to
beat
this
beer
the
only
thing
that
keeps
it
from
becoming
a
perfect
5
its
hard
to
drink
many
of
them
in
one
sitting
be
that
as
it
may
if
it
is
possible

brooklyn

much

make
this
a

a
coffeelike
roastiness
as
tasty
as
you
would
imagine
were
not
talking
chocolate
malt
here
were
talking
real
chocolate
i
almost
expected
to
see
a
halfdissolved
hershey
bar
clinking
around
in
the
bottle
after
i
poured
out
the
last
of
the
beer
pour
was
thick
and
black
like
used
motor
oil
only
a
stout
lover
could
find
this
description
appetizing
creamy
and
chockfull
of
mocha
chocolate
like
a
chocolate
creme
soda
im
a
fan
of
youngs
luxury
double
chocolate
stout
but
youngs
is
no
match
for
this
chocolate
monster
my
only
ding
against
this
rogue
is
the
drinkability
factor
a
little
of
this
beer
went
a
long
way
for
me
and
toward
the
end
the
chocolate
became
cloying
and
just
too
much
a
great
dessert
beer
rogue
can
do
stouts
and
thats
all
there
is
to
it
not
as
good
as
the
shakespeare
stout
but
good
stouts
have
a
little
dark
chocolate
flavor
to
them
to
start
with
and
this
one
just
accents
that
flavor
a
bit
more
good
stuff
wow
when
rogue
says
chocolate
they
mean
it
spectacular
brew
smooth
oatmeal
stout
with
light
coffee
hints
despite
this
being
related
to
a
stout
it
got
as
much
ipa
in
it
and
i
love
both
sides
because
they
add
up
so
well
together
the
long
aftertaste
rounds
it
all
up
as
it
is
defined
by
a
hoppy
bitterness
which
goes
along
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
which
again
stand
in
perfect
balance
to
each
other
the
coffee
used
seems
to
be
quite
funky
with
a
hint
of
barnyard
coming
through
teku
glass

pitch
black
with
mochlike

this
was

at

and
im
so
glad
that
i
know
how
good
they
can
be
probably
the
best
black
ipa
ive
had
although
its
more
like
a
stout
but
really
great
stuff
topnotch
beer
dont
let
this
one
slide
by
if
you
enjoy
beer
brewed
with
coffee
mikkeller
beer
geek
breakfast
is
amazing
and
one
of
my
favorites
but
this
beer
shows
that
you
cant
just
add
hops
to
anything
to
make
it
better
the
coffee
and
hops
compete
with
each
other
too
much
and
destroy
each
other
to
create
another
hoppy
stout
mostly
indistinguishable
from
the
others
it
looks
nice
at
least
i
really
like
hops
but
there
are
other
beers
better
suited
to
showcase
hop
flavors
than
this
says
black
india
pals
ale
brewed
with
coffee
on
bottle
it
is
ipa
with
lots
of
coffee
the
beauty
of
these
really
dark
beers
is
that
when
i
employ
an
aggro
pour
the
pseudocascade
is
extremely
visible
i
sat
back
in
awe
and
watched
it
settle
into
two
fingers
of
very
dense
deeptanlightbrown
head
with
good
retention
color
was
an
opaque
black
srm
44
and
it
looked
like
the
depths
of
outer
space
in
my
glass
nose
was
both
darkroasted
coffee
and
fresh
mint
possibly
spearmint
or
perhaps
peppermint
very
nice
mouthfeel
was
slightly
full
just
a
step
above
medium
the
taste
was
what
i
want
from
this
cascadiandarkblack
ipa
style
mint
chocolate
and
coffee
i
was
actually
getting
the
hops
which
is
not
usually
the
case
i
was
really
reminded
of
a
york
peppermint
patty
especially
since
i
was
getting
the
sensation
finish
was
semidry
and
very
pleasant
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
before
reaching
for
a
regular
aipa
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
it
is
big
and
has
bold
flavors
but
it
has
comparatively
more
balance
than
many
american
stouts
very
good
thick
and
wholesome
roasty
and
toasted
malt
barley
and
coffee
nice
tannish
head
more
coffeeish
than

beautiful
creamy

super
dark

the
tannins
and
bitter
residual
from
the
coffee
come
with
the
very
slight
hops
very
coffeebitter
at
the
end
poured
into
a
fremont
small
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
appearing
opaque
in
the
glass
with
a
thin
head
dissipating
to
light
patches
and
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
slight
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
dark
toasted

of

with

rich

cocoa
milk
chocolate
light

very
nicely
integrated

with

an
excellent
very
well
balanced
coffee
stout
with
a
rich
creamy
oatmeal
stout
body
supplemented
with
good
quality
coffee
and
cocoa
flavors
smooth
and
very
tasty
o
ive
been
losing
interest
in
stouts
admitted
so
i
decided
to
pick
this
one
up
on
a
whim
to
give
it
a
whirl
this
brew
has
successfully
reminded
me
of
why
i
loved
stouts
in
the
first
place
lots
of
roasted
coffee
flavors
that
are
perfectly
balanced
with
some
dark
chocolate
notes
and
a
delicate
hint
of
hops
this
brew
definitely
satisfied
and
makes
for
a
perfect
treat
in
the
early
afternoon
or
late
at
night
this
is
good
beer
but
one
that
ive
never
really
had
on
my
own
mikkel
hop
breakfast
is
something
ive
always
wanted
to
try
but
at
the
same
time
its
rosti
its
hot
the
intended
peppers
shine
through
nice
hot
peppery
stout
aftertaste
is
peppery
spicy
roasted
red
green
and
yellow
peppershabanero
awesome
wonderful
hoppy
and
dark
malt
scents
that
err
on
the
sweet
side
the
palate
mimics
the
nose
closely
with
a
nice
kiss
of
char
and
huge
bite
of
bitterness
would
gladly
have
this
hop
forward
offering
again
interesting
hybrid
beer
a
cross
between
a
black
ipa
and
a
flavored
oatmeal
stout
tons
of
complexity
the
aftertaste
threw
me
off
a
little
but
did
not
ruin
the
experience
definitely
a
unique
beer
but
i
personally
prefer
beer
geek
breakfast
bottle
snagged
from
tipples
pours
pitch
black
into
my
tulip
with
a
big
fluffy
mocha
head
aroma
if
lemony
hops
chocolatey
roast
that
somehow
seem
to
work
nicely
together
the
flavor
follows
with
an
initial
burst
of
bitter
lemon
hop
flavor
then
fades
into
big
roasty
chocolate
and
then
leaves
a
strangely
lemon
chocolate
combo
on
the
palate
but
more
lemon
than
chocolate
velvety
and
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
this
is
very
unique
and
the
only
other
stout
i
have
had
with
this
level
of
hops
is
darkness
but
the
flavor
profile
is
totally
different
glad
to
try
it
it
is
tasty
but
i
dont
know
that
i
would
want
this
on
a
regular
basis
kind
of
like
someone
poured
lemon
pinesol
in
my
fis
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film

of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
dark
chocolate
herbal
hop
and
slight
rubber
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
coffee
and
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
fairly
intense
presence
from
both
the
roasty
and
hop
flavors
o
hop
heads
and
coffee
lovers
unite
right
there
with
stone
on
their
coffee
ipa
really
enjoy
the
unique
aspect
of
this
one
listed
as
a
black
ipa
on
the
label
marketing
or
just
poking
fun
at
the
grey
area
here

with

get
this
dont
think
twice
get
it
if
you
prefer
your
stouts
smooth
with
some

this
is
still
worth

overall
this
is
a
fantastic

all
around
great
balance
and
complexity
of
roasted

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
one
of
the
more
bitter
stouts
ive
had
i
enjoyed
the
hopped
character
to
this
one
surprisingly
drinkable
despite
the
complexity
from
all
of
the
balanced
components
i
dig
a
pleasant
surprise
i
thought
this
was
a
second
bottle
of
beer
geek
brunch
that
i
had
brought
back
from
steins
in
new
orleans
last
year
pulled
the
bottle
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
my
mistake
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
like
a
baltic
breakfast
stout
hoppy
sweet
and
delicious
need
to
make
more
mistakes
like
this
only
thing
i
would
change
would
be
to
add
just
a
little
more
body
o
my
favorite
that
ive
had
from
the
breakfast
lineup
very
drinkable
but
like
usual
mikkeller
is
just
so
expensive
have
had
better
dark
beers
this
one
tastes
quite
heavy
but
not
quite
a
full
enough
flavour
to
compensate
for
the
weighty
bitterness
just
a
bit
ashy
and
astringent
not
an
everyday
beer
visually
really
really
appealing
pitch
black
body
flowing
huge
tan
head
frothing
above
the
sides
of
my
chalice
fine
even
lacing
as
it
slowly
fades
aroma
has
dark
chocolate
bitterness
and
hint
of
pine
and
citrus
tone
hops
in
the
background
with
a
somewhat
creamed
coffee
in
the
middle
bitterness
unwavering
bitterness
green
hops
assault
the
palate
with
a
pelletized
hop
concentration
black
malts
mainly
black
patent
bring
out
the
charcoal
and
roasted
malt
bitterness
so
theres
a
bit
of
a
tag
team
combo
hitting
me
hard
right
now
i
really
couldnt
tell
you
they
used
oatmeal
but
dark
bitter
coffee
dark
malts
and
hops
are
screaming
hello
mouthfeel
never
gets
past
any
one
of
the
waves
of
bitterness
it
coats
all
dimensions
of
the
palate
medium
bodied
even
solid
carbonation
no
issues
there
just
the
lacquer
known
has
beer
hop
breakfast
is
left
behind
coating
the
entire
palate
with
a
lingering
unbalanced
bitterness
overall
i
wish
the
gypsy
brewer
had
a
stroke
of
finesse
in
his
paint
brush
maybe
due
to
the
country
where
the
brewing
scene
is
breaking
out
like
a
punk
rock
movement
do
most
of
these
guys
feel
the
need
to
brew
this
way
believe
me
i
like
extreme
beer
i
just
like
well
balanced
big
beers
o
i
enjoy
beer
geek
breakfast
more
but
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
hoppiness
makes
it
almost
taste
like
a
black
ipa
o
this
is
good
stuff
just
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
given
the
stout
style
description
i
suppose
the
word
hop
in
the
name
shouldve
been
a
give
away
but
still
think
of
this
as
an
american
black
ale
and
youll
be
pleased
pours
up
amazing
foamy
dark
tan
head
great
lacing
the
head
made
it
thru
the
whole
journey
aroma
is
very
hoppy
some
malts
creeping
thru
nice
aroma
now
the
taste
its
too
much
youve
got
big
bold
malts
battling
heavy
hops
i
dont
ever
eat
chocolate
with
ketchup
its
too
crazy
in
this
bottle
its
not
bad
but
its
not
good
full
bodied
heavy
crispy
carbo
meh
just
an
experiment
i
suppose
overall
a
nice
imperial
stout
with
an
extra
dimension
from
the
hops
its
not
uber
complex
but
there
are
some
nice
layers
here
that
make
it
interesting
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
search
this
out
but
i
will
pick
it
up
again
if
i
see
it
for
a
decent
price
odefinitely
an
awesome
stout
has
a
high
quality
flavor
to
it
something
you
expect
from
a
high
profile
stout
beer
hop
breakfast
is
a
fascinating
beer
that
even
after
an
entire
bottle
i
still
dont
feel
that
i
have
fully
explored
the
beer
nor
decided
about
its
character
its
certainly
a
complex
beer
that
has
some
bullyish
overtones
though
its
taste
is
brash
it
seems
to
work
somehow
o
while
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
seemed
a
bit
overwhelming
at
first
the
flavors
really
start
to
blend
and
work
together
as
the
beer
goes
along
a
stout
hopped
like
a
pale
ale
is
certainly
an
interesting
experience
while
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
regularly
i
definitely
appreciate
the
experience
and
i
think
mikkeller
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
d
nice
hoppy
stout
great
overall
balance
interesting
combination
of
flavors
the
citrus
juxtaposes
the
roast
malt
and
coffee
which
are
complemented
well
by
the
bitter
resiny
hops
but
its
too
bitter
for
my
liking
the
beer
pours
a
dull
black
with
almost
no
head
the
nose
is
bitter
with
a
faint
roastiness
tasting
presents
a
bit
of
alcohol
with
a
lot
more
burnt
roastiness
and
much
more
of
the
juicy
piney
hops
which
announce
themselves
startlingly
on
my
unsuspecting
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
not
thickchewy
like
a
ris
with
a
saturating
bitterness
its
a
good
beer
with
a
bitterness
at
the
caliber
of
a
fresh
oak
aged
yeti
yup
i
think
this
tops
the
beer
geek
breakfast
for
me
what
an
awesome
brew
this
is
big
thanks
to
my
lovely
girlfriend
for
hooking
this
up
as
an
xmas
present
for
me
the
pour
is
real
dark
pushing
black
no
light
through
at
all
big
frothy
four
fingers
of
white
lace
on
top
settling
some
but
not
going
totally
away
the
nose
and
taste
are
both
coffee
first
rich
and
black
fresh
brewed
but
its
not
as
intense
as
mikkellers
other
coffee
stouts
its
tempered
here
by
a
lot
of
oats
and
some
malt
sweetness
and
hops
the
hops
are
low
key
bitter
but
not
oily
or
pungent
too
much
just
a
nice
complement
to
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
and
a
knife
through
the
sugary
malts
heavy
roast
delicious
finish
is
long
and
complex
evolving
feel
makes
it
though
so
much
smoothness
in
texture
from
the
oats
no
coffee
acidity
at
all
i
have
no
idea
how
he
does
it
but
this
beer
is
extraordinary
full
body
just
enough
carbonation
i
would
honestly
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
this
beer
for
breakfast
anytime
it
has
everything
you
need
couldnt
feel
the
caffeine
in
this
one
like
i
could
in
some
of
his
others
but
nevermind
that
this
is
outstanding
more
than
outstanding
one
of
his
best
and
thats
saying
a
lot
from
me
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
as
are
most
of
the
mikkeller
breakfast
beers
in
my
opinion
with
a
nice
complexity
of
flavor
and
a
pleasant
hop
bite
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
i
would
be
happy
to
have
another
one
of
these
overall
enjoyable
beverage
comparable
to
founders
double
chocolate
stout
once
again
mikkeller
has
failed
once
again
this
brew
was
not
worth
the
10
tag
dissapointment
thin
dark
tan
head
on
a
jet
black
body
and
nice
tan
lacing
absolutely
great
coffee
aroma
earthy
hops
fire
wood
and
campfire
with
hints
of
cocoa
flavor
is
very
good
as
well
with
more
excellent
espresso
and
coffee
roast
toasted
malts
earthy
hops
hint
of
dark
chocolate
medium
body
and
light
to
medium
body
for
the
style
great
coffee
flavor
near
perfect
coffee
roasted
malt
and
hop
balance
only
thing
to
make
this
one
better
would
be
a
more
complex
hop
profile
overall
tried
cause
i
love
the
breakfast
variations
ive
tried
in
the
past
fully
expecting
this
to
be
a
mediocre
experiment
not
so
much
quite
good
o
definitely
a
stout
made
in
heaven
well
crafted
and
with
very
complex
aromas
and
flavors
seek
it
out
now
ordered
a
goblet
for
8
at
top
hops
in
les
nyc
and
it
made
for
a
perfect
fall
beer
there
was
a
deep
roasted
malt
character
complemented
by
a
sharp
citrus
hop
bite
the
citrus
hops
didnt
get
much
of
a
chance
to
stand
out
from
the
richly
mocha
barley
but
they
did
blend
in
wonderfully
for
a
long
lingering
pine
and
cocoa
finish
i
like
that
the
abv
isnt
over
the
top
yet
its
still
a
fantastic
sipping
beer
get
yourself
a
glass
and
let
the
dry
cocoa
coffee
bean
and
american
hops
roll
around
on
your
tongue
a
high
recommendation
that
i
will
seek
out
again
as
i
really
liked
this
crazy
combo
of
strong
hops
blended
with
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
there
was
a
ton
of
sediment
in
the
last
sip
and
it
washed
over
my
tongue
like
a
bitter
stout
poured
through
a
burnt
wood
funnel
complete
with
chunks
that
closed
the
door
on
a
great
beer
experience
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
but
at
10
40
for
a
half
liter
it
should
be
killer
reisinous
hops
roastycascadian
ipa
all
the
way
wellbalanced
and
great
flavor
another
winner
from
mikkeller
a
bit
pricey
but
certainly
worth
a
try
omy
introduction
to
mikkeller
and
i
will
certainly
be
trying
the
remaining
brews
i
can
get
my
hands
on
16
9
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
frothy
tan
head
that
stayed
around
a
while
theres
also
a
lot
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
piney
hops
burntcharred
malt
and
some
light
citrusy
hops
i
think
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
its
roasty
hoppy
bitter
and
sweet
all
at
the
same
time
its
a
very
tasty
brew
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
with
good
carbonation
im
liking
this
beer
a
lot
and
i
plan
on
picking
up
another
bottle
soon
9
99
a
bottle
overall
a
very
nice
hoppy
stout
that
tastes
really
good
i
cant
find
much
to
complain
about
but
theres
nothig
that
makes
it
a
really
memorable
beer
just
a
good
solid
beer
pours
black
in
color
with
a
tall
tan
head
citrus
peel
floral
and
perfume
hints
of
chocolate
lots
of
roasted
malt
some
ash
and
a
bit
of
char
maybe
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
flavor
is
quite
ashy
heavy
on
the
roast
and
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
some
dark
chocolate
piney
hops
and
a
hint
of
citrus
peel
beer
hop
breakfast
indeed
very
good
a
deep
complex
soup
much
hops
and
much
more
this
is
a
nice
one
time
experience
with
that
said
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
again
a
bit
off
tasting
with
the
amount
of
hops
they
used
do
i
like
it
maybe
do
i
love
it
not
really
but
keep
at
it
mikkeller
youve
more
hits
than
misses
and
your
misses
are
interesting
enough
but
perhaps
not
exactly
worth
the
price
a
very
impressive
beer
and
one
that
has
reminded
me
why
i
like
mikkeller
so
much
a
delicious
stout
with
an
amped
up
hop
profile
deep
complexities
and
tons
of
flavor
impressive
blend
of
bitterness
from
all
of
the
roast
and
hops
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
true
pint
the
beer
is
an
extremely
dark
auburnbrown
to
almost
black
coloring
with
a
tall
frothy
dense
chocolate
milk
colored
head
that
quickly
recedes
into
a
thin
filmy
coating
aromas
are
roasty
with
a
heavy
mocha
and
slight
hoppy
balance
smells
heavy
and
delicious
flavors
are
heavily
roasted
with
a
dark
coffee
backbone
that
almost
has
a
charcoal
character
to
it
resiny
hops
highlights
throughout
with
an
unbalance
that
strangely
works
with
the
style
the
body
is
slightly
thinner
than
i
was
expecting
for
the
style
and
even
after
i
poured
it
but
it
works
the
aftertaste
has
a
slight
smoke
and
roast
but
surprisingly
more
hoppy
than
anything
wet
resiny
bitter
hops
at
the
end
of
the
palate
make
it
feel
like
you
just
drank
a
heavy
dipa
the
finish
is
rich
slick
and
with
a
slight
roasty
linger
good
solid
brew
o
glad
i
tried
this
and
it
is
pretty
tasty
the
intense
hop
bitterness
almost
moves
this
into
black
ale
territory
a
bit
of
added
sweetness
would
bump
this
up
a
notch
for
me
but
still
a
good
brew
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
has
almost
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
hops
just
a
fantastic
oatmeal
stout
final
thoughts
at
11
a
pop
and
a
7
5
abv
this
is
expensive
but
awesome
awesome
beer
d
enjoying
the
pronounced
hop
and
malt
profiles
that
compliment
each
other
very
well
incredibly
bitter
and
dry
characteristics
that
i
wish
i
could
magically
sprinkle
into
any
beer
when
i
want
impressed
o
this
is
an
odd
combo
it
works
if
you
expect
it
but
i
cannot
see
myself
drinking
more
than
this
bottle
a
weird
mix
for
sure
check
it
out
and
see
if
you
like
it
who
knows
it
could
be
the
next
big
thing
mikkeller
always
like
to
push
the
envelope
and
this
is
one
of
those
tasty
once
and
maybe
sketchy
twice
overall
this
has
been
the
best
beer
that
i
have
had
from
mikkeller
their
beers
are
usually
done
well
but
not
well
enough
to
justify
the
price
they
charge
however
this
one
was
worth
the
price
and
id
buy
it
again
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
fairly
aggressive
carbonation
that
makes
this
a
bit
prickly
on
the
palate
a
fairly
high
alcohol
content
in
an
oatmeal
stout
would
suggest
a
thicker
beer
with
a
smoother
carbonation
this
is
not
particularly
smooth
at
all
the
carbonation
level
makes
you
sip
it
rather
quickly
finish
is
mostly
dry
with
a
bit
of
stickiness
around
the
edges
of
the
mouth
this
isnt
as
robust
or
full
bodied
as
i
would
have
hoped
but
it
is
smooth
and
flavorful
its
worth
checking
out
od
quite
a
good
hoppy
stout
richness
makes
it
clearly
a
stout
and
not
a
black
ipa
really
drinkable
nails
it
pretty
good
o
not
my
cup
of
brew
i
can
see
how
someone
really
into
stouts
would
love
this
beer
but
its
just
not
for
me
i
expected
more
hops
less
stout
and
coffee
a
quality
stout
though
it
falls
just
short
of
superb
the
hop
flavour
doesnt
really
come
across
subtle
hints
that
are
smothered
by
an
excess
of
coffee
the
mouthfeel
also
seems
a
tad
thin
however
the
coffeemalt
character
are
without
deficiency
all
in
all
a
beer
that
strives
for
greatness
and
is
found
wanting
which
isnt
to
say
that
its
bad
grab
one
if
you
can
stomach
the
price
could
use
more
carbonation
to
create
a
creamier
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
that
combines
the
stout
and
ipa
styles
which
are
my
two
favorites
into
one
bottle
definitely
not
for
all
beer
geeks
but
it
was
tasty
and
very
interesting
for
me
for
10
99
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
as
this
is
not
quite
a
world
class
brew
thick
two
finger
head
of
super
dark
brown
surface
filled
with
larger
bubbles
which
contributes
to
a
steady
dissolve
you
can
watch
it
disappear
the
lacing
has
moderate
strength
but
not
so
much
density
the
liquid
is
fully
black
however
you
see
some
tiny
bubbles
rising
inside
and
the
outer
rims
and
surface
take
on
a
yellow
hue
looks
sturdy
the
nose
offers
palpable
coffee
roast
along
with
powdered
chocolate
and
cocoa
big
burst
of
pink
grapefruit
and
pine
betrays
the
hops
presence
in
some
ways
the
green
herbal
nature
becomes
dominant
minor
notes
of
plum
or
cherry
fruit
doesnt
come
across
as
sweet
as
expected
mediumbodied
whats
there
feels
heavy
on
the
tongue
here
the
roast
more
pronounced
and
bitter
coffee
grounds
dark
chocolate
mocha
tar
tobacco
resin
with
toasted
bread
more
than
softer
yeast
accents
the
pine
grapefruit
and
leaf
to
grass
hops
bust
right
up
the
middle
minimal
sweetness
found
on
the
tongue
too
the
carbonation
is
subtly
refreshing
more
than
a
definite
presence
no
real
fruit
presence
the
finish
becomes
more
astringent
to
bitter
tastes
clearly
like
a
fusion
of
two
different
beers
more
curious
than
pleasurable
probably
my
least
favourite
of
the
beer
geek
series
so
far
o
disappointing
not
a
bad
oatmeal
stout
but
doesnt
live
up
to
the
price
or
hype
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
but
it
is
quite
a
shock
at
first
but
interesting
to
think
about
o
this
is
a
very
nice
coffee
stout
yet
another
really
good
brew
from
mikkeller
o
overall
this
beer
is
tough
for
me
to
review
it
walks
a
line
between
two
styles
not
quite
as
hop
heavy
as
id
like
for
a
black
ipa
and
not
nearly
as
creamy
chewy
as
id
want
for
a
stout
that
being
said
this
is
still
another
solid
offering
from
mikkeller
overall
a
nice
assault
by
mikkeller
update
definitely
notice
the
coffee
more
throughout
and
there
is
a
strong
yeast
flavor
its
maybe
covered
up
by
the
other
strong
flavors
o
incredible
beer
that
every
beer
lover
should
try
just
to
the
light
of
mid
bodied
nearly
creamy
drinks
pretty
easy
but
there
is
a
warming
for
only
7
5
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
it
is
different
but
pretty
good
this
was
a
good
experience
but
the
balance
just
didnt
work
out
for
me
i
may
age
the
bottle
or
trade
it
to
get
the
edge
off
works
better
than
i
thought
it
would
on
paper
didnt
think
adding
coffee
to
a
black
ipa
or
more
technically
adding
hops
to
a
coffeeoatmeal
stout
would
work
well
but
this
does
i
would
like
to
see
this
done
a
bit
more
the
hops
were
definitely
more
present
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
falls
off
a
bit
from
there
in
overall
intensity
overall
this
is
one
of
the
tastiest
abas
i
have
come
across
have
a
very
hard
time
seeing
how
it
fits
into
the
beer
geek
breakfast
series
however
o
great
in
some
dimensions
lacking
in
others
if
you
like
a
hoppy
stout
this
beer
is
for
you
a
hoppy
stout
but
a
good
one
despite
the
mouthfeel
not
matching
up
with
the
nose
and
taste
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
definitely
has
the
most
assertive
hop
character
is
any
stout
i
have
every
had
and
it
does
so
without
being
too
bitter
and
without
encroaching
on
the
other
characteristics
very
well
done
o
never
had
something
like
this
with
the
amount
of
hops
in
a
stout
something
different
probably
couldnt
drink
two
in
a
row
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
creamy
yet
the
bitters
of
the
hops
and
coffee
are
very
overpowering
nothing
wrong
with
that
on
many
levels
but
just
not
a
preferred
lingering
mouthfeel
that
i
enjoy
the
order
goes
like
this
beer
geek
brunch
beer
geek
breakfast
beer
hop
breakfast
that
isnt
to
say
hop
breakfast
is
bad
the
aromas
great
and
its
so
highly
hopped
that
i
confused
it
at
times
with
a
black
ipa
the
citrusy
hops
just
never
meld
with
the
coffee
in
a
way
that
agrees
with
my
palate
beer
hop
breakfast
is
a
very
dark
black
color
with
a
thickish
look
the
dark
brown
mocha
colored
foam
up
top
has
great
retention
with
minor
sticks
a
slick
coats
the
glass
when
sipping
smell
is
very
hoppy
pine
is
very
in
charge
with
earthy
tones
and
coffe
grinds
roasted
malt
plays
a
part
as
well
tasting
this
beer
hop
breakfast
delivers
hops
and
coffee
some
flaked
oats
oatmeal
with
roasted
malt
and
a
somewhat
astringent
bitter
taste
towards
the
end
like
most
mikkeller
beers
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
feel
is
a
nice
healthy
medium
and
probably
bigger
than
that
fair
carb
with
a
piney
lasting
aftertaste
that
kills
things
at
least
for
me
mikkeller
is
hit
or
miss
with
me
and
this
one
was
not
a
hit
i
could
not
even
finish
my
glass
o
i
generally
do
not
care
for
hoppy
stouts
but
i
find
this
one
to
be
very
interesting
this
is
really
a
near
excellent
americanstyle
stout
very
much
worth
picking
up
o
i
wasnt
very
impressed
certainly
liked
the
beer
geek
better
i
didnt
like
that
there
wasnt
any
coffee
coming
though
if
you
told
me
it
was
a
black
ipa
versus
a
imperial
stout
with
coffee
and
hops
id
certainly
believe
you
interesting
but
not
the
best
ive
had
o
a
very
interesting
variation
on
beer
geek
breakfast
the
hops
dominate
like
no
other
but
i
think
that
was
the
point
i
do
wish
it
was
a
bit
thicker
in
body
because
i
think
it
would
work
better
however
beer
geek
is
pretty
thin
too
nice
work
by
mikkeller
and
certainly
worth
a
try
but
i
probably
dont
need
to
have
this
one
again
for
a
while
a
lot
of
hop
some
stout
this
could
almost
pass
for
a
black
ipa
im
still
not
a
huge
fan
of
mikkellers
stouts
but
i
appreciate
the
beer
geek
series
thus
far
for
how
hoppy
this
beer
is
i
imagined
more
body
and
more
dark
flavors
especially
with
the
rise
of
black
ales
and
ipas
its
really
important
to
distinguish
between
styles
this
beer
almost
comes
in
a
gray
area
between
the
two
o
from
the
smell
i
was
expecting
something
more
like
a
black
ipa
on
steriods
but
what
i
got
was
an
average
stout
with
a
descent
hop
finish
lots
of
coffee
and
a
strong
piney
grassy
hop
flavor
malty
with
moderate
sweetness
and
dark
chocolate
not
that
thick
which
makes
this
pretty
easy
to
drink
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
and
doesnt
clash
with
the
roasty
flavor
of
the
beer
making
it
astringent
it
drinks
like
a
black
ipa
highly
recommended
let
the
battle
begin
the
roasted
malts
wrestle
with
the
piney
resinous
hops
for
control
over
the
tongue
very
interesting
alternative
to
the
style
fullbodied
and
delicious
i
didnt
expect
to
want
this
beer
again
o
wow
very
interesting
beer
the
pine
and
resin
is
incredible
even
mixed
into
a
pretty
strong
stout
this
level
of
hoppiness
in
an
ipa
would
probably
melt
my
teeth
its
not
bad
at
all
in
fact
its
quite
good
just
be
prepared
for
the
onslaught
that
you
cant
possibly
expect
o
interesting
beer
the
name
beer
hop
breakfast
does
not
lie
very
hoppy
the
gf
thought
it
was
too
hoppybitter
and
she
loves
a
hoppy
ipa
the
hop
bitterness
was
balanced
with
a
nice
coffeesmokeyspicy
malt
backbone
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
into
an
impy
nonic
pitch
blackno
light
showing
thru
thisa
fluffy
mocha
colored
crown
atop
that
left
broken
chunks
of
lace
behind
as
it
setteled
slowly
into
a
frothy
mass
big
hop
resin
mixed
molasses
sweetness
just
awesomethis
is
truly
a
hybrid
of
stout
and
aba
chocolate
malts
and
tobacco
flavors
mixed
with
a
healthy
shot
of
pine
resin
on
the
palatesome
molasseslike
sweetness
comes
into
play
but
doesnt
intrued
on
the
resiny
hops
i
have
the
hop
burps
wich
makes
me
like
this
beer
even
morea
great
example
of
the
styleone
of
the
best
i
have
had
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
unique
beer
there
were
a
lot
of
elements
present
that
i
would
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
but
lots
of
hoppy
ipa
character
as
well
and
it
was
all
blended
very
smoothly
together
definitely
will
seek
this
one
out
again
o
an
awesome
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
love
the
choice
of
hops
used
in
this
one
i
really
love
the
way
the
favors
intermingle
o
if
i
close
my
eyes
im
drinking
a
3f
black
sun
but
with
bigger
oat
stout
flavor
this
beer
melds
hop
and
oatmaltcoffee
while
still
showcasing
the
hops
up
front
and
letting
the
classic
oat
stout
shine
through
on
the
end
mikkeller
imo
is
either
an
out
of
the
park
dinger
or
a
monumental
bust
for
which
i
feel
i
have
paid
too
much
usually
the
former
rather
than
the
latter
this
one
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
aroma
and
the
taste
if
you
closed
your
eyes
you
may
be
tricked
into
thinking
this
is
a
straight
ipa
but
when
you
open
your
eyes
up
and
dig
deeper
you
discover
a
vast
depth
to
the
malt
profile
the
hops
too
are
bright
and
bold
and
mix
nicely
with
the
equally
as
stark
grain
bill
the
smokiness
puts
this
brew
over
the
top
and
helps
make
this
a
standup
example
of
the
style
o
extremely
enjoyable
for
such
a
big
beer
it
is
very
approachable
and
easy
to
drink
booze
is
subtle
and
bitterness
is
balanced
superb
taste
again
more
like
beer
geek
breakfast
this
is
a
very
minor
and
subtle
variation
frankly
but
thats
not
all
bad
since
the
base
beer
is
quite
good
same
beer
more
hops
thats
really
about
it
loads
of
chocolate
malt
coffee
ashy
bitterness
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
deep
tan
mocha
head
rings
and
patches
of
lace
go
down
the
glass
aromas
of
coffee
herbal
hops
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
in
the
taste
decadant
malt
body
coffee
vanilla
chocolate
all
savory
flavors
hop
bitterness
is
substantial
and
coarse
piney
leafy
and
resinous
oatmeal
lends
to
the
smoothness
of
this
beer
and
its
creamyness
overall
the
beer
hop
breakfast
is
a
delicious
oatmeal
stout
with
plenty
of
hops
as
advertised
complex
and
easy
to
drink
id
suggest
giving
it
a
try
o
quite
enjoyable
but
i
like
the
original
better
im
a
hop
head
but
when
i
want
a
stout
i
dont
necessarily
want
it
to
be
hoppy
but
thats
just
personal
taste
this
perfectly
matches
what
the
brewer
was
trying
to
accomplish
though
a
hopped
up
stout
so
i
say
this
beer
is
a
win
o
hop
head
and
coffee
fans
might
love
it
i
feel
its
lacking
in
body
and
complexity
i
expect
more
from
mikkeller
but
mikkel
is
still
my
favorite
brewer
lastly
i
could
smell
this
all
day
gotta
say
i
like
beer
geek
breakfast
more
but
this
one
isnt
bad
by
any
means
bottle
500
ml
color
back
with
small
brown
head
aroma
hop
and
only
hop
at
first
after
some
time
you
can
smell
some
espresso
taste
coffee
but
so
much
coffee
that
dominates
everything
else
some
hop
light
chocolate
strange
beer
a
little
unbalanced
but
i
like
it
this
is
my
first
mikkeller
and
it
was
simply
fantastic
in
all
aspects
cheers
dr
very
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
and
for
the
style
the
price
is
high
but
its
well
worth
it
for
the
quality
pour
was
a
nice
dark
brown
nearly
black
in
color
with
a
nice
head
of
off
white
tan
color
on
top
that
really
just
showed
how
nicely
this
one
was
put
together
a
wonderful
aroma
of
thick
coffee
and
crisp
piney
hops
then
came
up
and
cleared
the
air
really
making
its
presence
known
huge
aroma
with
warming
bringing
caramel
and
brown
sugar
to
the
front
and
smooth
lightly
bitter
coffee
balancing
it
out
nice
smooth
hop
presence
with
a
rich
malty
back
bone
that
was
beyond
smooth
really
just
wonderfully
done
o
probably
my
favorite
beer
that
i
have
experienced
so
far
everything
about
this
was
wonderful
from
start
to
finish
and
it
is
such
a
disappointment
to
see
that
beautiful
tan
residue
on
the
glass
where
an
outstanding
beer
once
was
if
you
see
this
beer
anywhere
for
any
price
buy
it
you
will
not
be
let
down
m
medium
body
light
carbonation
pours
near
black
with
a
longlasting
deep
tan
head
strong
lacing
and
a
heavy
roast
and
chocolate
character
in
the
nose
good
dosing
of
pine
and
faint
earth
heavy
pine
especially
as
it
warms
good
balance
between
the
pine
and
roast
in
the
flavor
medium
body
with
a
dry
resinous
finish
fairly
bitter
mostly
from
the
hops
really
quite
tasty
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
thin
beige
cap
the
appearance
bears
an
uncanny
resemblance
to
the
other
beer
geek
stouts
surprisingly
good
aroma
exceeding
my
expectations
terrific
blend
of
hops
and
dark
roast
this
taste
much
more
like
an
american
black
ale
black
ipa
than
a
stout
really
well
balanced
and
full
of
flavor
a
wonderful
marriage
of
roast
and
hops
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
mouthfeel
weak
body
great
carbonation
oatmeal
stouts
need
to
be
thicker
than
this
and
creamier
neither
one
is
there
whatsoever
o
my
hats
off
to
mikkeller
on
this
one
stoutipa
rolled
into
one
the
best
of
both
worlds
starts
out
like
a
creamy
oatmeal
stout
and
finishes
with
that
bitter
dry
ipa
finish
well
done
this
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
stouts
ive
had
it
has
all
of
the
better
qualities
of
a
stout
with
the
exception
of
the
overly
bitter
aftertaste
and
adds
to
that
a
hoppy
undertone
it
may
have
an
effect
on
the
hops
but
aging
this
might
improve
it
some
i
like
the
interplay
of
hops
and
stout
in
the
flavor
loads
of
roasted
dark
malts
in
the
front
and
a
decidedly
citrusy
hops
flavor
in
the
rear
no
negative
bitterness
and
not
really
sweet
either
making
this
much
tastier
than
darkness
or
nightstalker
the
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
which
i
like
just
fine
very
nice
a
great
addition
to
the
lineup
mouthfeeloverall
medium
bodied
with
extremely
fine
carbonation
very
smooth
drinking
comes
close
to
creamy
probably
the
best
aspect
of
the
beer
overall
a
good
stout
by
mikkeller
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
o
a
fantastic
incorporation
of
hops
in
a
big
heavy
stout
well
worth
a
try
and
maybe
even
a
second
purchase
pours
jet
black
with
a
chocolate
brown
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
roast
and
pine
hops
in
the
taste
pine
hops
and
a
small
sweet
and
roasty
oatmeal
a
hop
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mothfeel
with
a
dryer
small
hop
and
small
roast
in
the
aftertaste
big
hops
and
small
oatmeal
and
roast
notes
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
stout
but
it
is
tasty
o
i
would
certainly
buy
it
again
and
recommend
it
to
others
not
sold
on
its
breakfast
beer
quality
since
im
use
to
founders
breakfast
stout
for
that
though
with
the
huge
addition
of
hops
you
could
sub
out
your
morning
orange
juice
i
suppose
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
creamy
smooth
texture
yet
oily
and
clingy
as
well
it
boasts
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
decently
drinkable
but
very
oily
and
overly
bitter
from
the
combination
of
hops
and
roasted
grain
i
throughly
enjoy
stouts
but
really
dislike
when
they
are
over
hopped
like
this
no
matter
how
much
i
try
to
like
them
i
just
cant
get
into
it
if
american
black
ales
are
your
thing
this
is
a
must
try
but
for
14
a
500ml
bottle
they
can
keep
it
in
my
opinion
o
the
flavor
on
this
beer
is
really
quite
something
the
way
that
the
hops
is
assimilated
into
the
chocolate
dessert
is
special
however
i
think
thats
the
most
special
thing
about
this
beer
its
so
much
better
than
the
mouthfeel
which
doesnt
connote
creaminess
in
the
same
way
the
flavor
pulls
butter
out
of
the
hop
resins
i
think
that
is
a
really
hard
thing
to
overcome
in
beer
as
it
requires
a
less
dry
mouthfeel
the
gap
in
the
longevity
of
mouthfeel
which
allows
the
alcohol
to
creep
in
over
the
flavor
to
contaminate
the
subtle
theme
of
buttery
chocolate
creaminess
eventually
the
hops
takeover
to
reclaim
the
flavor
in
favor
of
coffees
however
that
temporary
hole
in
the
transition
of
flavor
is
a
bit
irritating
and
generally
disrupted
a
pleasantly
surprising
flavor
experience
otherwise
this
is
really
something
to
try
o
one
thing
i
will
say
immediately
about
this
beer
as
its
best
to
enjoy
it
and
try
it
at
varying
temperatures
as
it
really
does
change
an
unusual
amount
as
it
warms
up
this
is
an
excellent
single
oatmeal
stout
with
some
unusual
characteristics
and
a
lot
of
well
developed
parts
sadly
though
no
eurekas
in
this
like
you
might
hope
for
from
the
occassional
mikkeller
stroke
of
genius
there
are
probably
cheaper
oatmeal
stout
alternatives
on
a
similar
level
available
to
an
american
craft
brew
drinker
also
while
this
is
good
i
think
its
not
quite
as
strong
as
mikkellers
other
breakfastbrunch
offerings
if
youre
curious
and
have
the
extra
cash
nothing
wrong
with
picking
this
up
but
this
is
not
a
must
for
anyone
interested
in
mikkeller
or
a
good
oatmeal
stout
o
this
is
a
really
well
put
together
stout
with
just
enough
hop
character
to
balance
out
the
rich
thick
malt
flavors
one
of
my
favorite
mikkeller
offerings
poured
reddish
black
color
with
an
average
frothy
brown
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
with
good
lacing
solid
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
malt
and
earthy
hop
aroma
medium
to
full
body
with
a
dry
smooth
texture
and
soft
carbonation
medium
to
heavy
roasted
balanced
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
with
a
heavy
chocolate
bittersweet
finish
of
long
duration
this
is
a
standout
beer
man
the
hops
really
mingle
nicely
with
this
coffee
stout
would
classify
well
as
a
black
ipa
yet
another
tasty
offering
in
the
beer
geek
series
and
im
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
even
if
it
was
overpriced
even
for
a
mikkeller
offering
beer
geek
breakfast
is
still
the
best
of
the
series
poured
into
stone
ris
glass
pours
a
nice
dark
black
with
a
large
one
finger
head
i
enjoyed
the
smell
on
this
one
classic
smell
of
the
base
beer
with
a
small
but
noticeable
herbal
hop
characteristic
at
the
end
the
taste
was
a
little
disappointing
to
me
as
the
hop
flavor
strong
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
were
there
but
the
hop
characteristic
did
not
come
through
that
much
slight
citrus
finnish
bitter
aftertaste
was
really
all
that
i
picked
up
as
far
as
the
hops
go
with
the
smell
i
thought
a
lot
more
would
come
through
in
the
taste
the
was
a
medium
to
full
body
beer
still
has
the
creamy
tongue
feel
that
the
rest
of
the
series
has
nice
bitter
tingle
left
at
the
end
not
bad
overall
mostly
carried
because
of
the
base
beer
not
a
bad
twist
but
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
hoppy
stouts
and
while
still
a
good
beer
didnt
live
up
to
what
i
was
hoping
for
o
love
mikkeller
helps
that
were
getting
more
of
this
stuff
distributed
up
here
a
nice
twist
on
an
already
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
just
really
creamy
alcohol
isnt
a
factor
at
all
if
i
can
find
it
i
will
buy
it
again
huge
notes
of
pine
fill
the
air
along
with
roasted
notes
slight
coffee
and
chocolate
poured
black
with
a
big
3
finger
mocha
head
dissipated
to
a
spongy
film
leaving
sticky
spongy
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
big
pine
notes
are
lot
more
balanced
in
the
taste
though
bold
they
meld
nicely
with
big
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
the
coffee
bitterness
blends
well
with
the
hop
bitterness
the
feel
is
nice
and
creamy
solid
medium
bodied
even
a
tad
chewy
nice
bit
of
substance
for
the
style
overall
im
in
love
i
adore
hoppy
stouts
and
this
is
a
shining
example
kudos
mikkel
o
usually
i
dont
mind
the
smell
of
simcoe
it
is
the
taste
that
annoys
the
crap
out
of
me
here
it
has
been
used
well
all
around
wow
im
in
love
with
this
beer
a
permawant
whatever
coffee
theyve
used
lent
itself
brilliantly
and
really
tied
things
together
overall
this
seemed
like
just
an
ok
stout
but
then
it
was
nicely
hopped
and
superbly
coffeed
idk
what
kind
but
id
love
to
try
a
brew
of
the
beans
they
seemed
kona
quality
o
i
feel
like
this
is
what
nighstalker
should
have
been
but
couldnt
do
i
didnt
feel
like
nightstalker
worked
and
i
didnt
really
enjoy
that
one
whereas
this
one
was
a
pretty
good
hoppy
stout
i
prefer
the
normal
beer
geek
breakfast
to
this
but
it
was
still
good
and
fun
to
try
would
have
it
again
be
in
the
mood
for
an
ipa
when
you
open
this
or
you
may
not
like
your
first
impression
very
interesting
brew
be
sure
to
let
it
warm
a
tad
for
max
enjoyment
another
nice
installment
from
mikkeller
in
the
beer
geek
series
with
some
fresh
green
hops
adding
some
complexity
to
things
i
still
like
the
original
better
though
this
one
has
certainly
earned
the
name
beer
hop
breakfast
the
hops
are
very
intense
here
if
only
the
breakfast
qualities
were
pushed
more
overall
an
excellent
brew
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
of
this
one
but
it
certainly
worked
out
great
the
coffee
was
very
present
but
it
didnt
overwhelm
the
brew
the
malt
base
still
played
a
roll
and
the
hops
were
the
star
of
the
show
especially
after
the
swallow
one
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
whos
looking
for
a
stout
with
a
little
something
going
on
thanks
doopie
o
i
think
this
is
what
mikkeller
was
going
for
with
koppi
has
the
coffee
characteristics
along
with
the
ipa
characteristics
if
anything
id
like
more
stout
flavor
but
its
a
damn
solid
brew
from
mikkeller
as
usual
an
excellent
dark
and
thick
rich
black
chocolate
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
that
fades
fast
but
leaves
pretty
sea
foam
lace
the
smell
is
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
a
touch
of
citrus
and
pine
the
taste
is
complex
full
rich
and
full
of
robust
coffee
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
notes
of
caramel
nuts
and
citruspine
making
an
appearance
im
not
sure
how
well
the
citrus
flavors
melt
together
with
the
roasted
flavors
not
that
well
balanced
for
a
stout
in
my
opinion
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
and
chalky
on
the
mouthfeel
could
use
more
sweet
caramel
notes
and
a
creamier
mouthfeel
excellent
beer
overall
but
had
holes
for
critique
i
was
surprised
and
pleased
to
find
this
bottle
of
beer
hop
breakfast
i
hadnt
heard
of
it
before
its
a
nice
addition
to
their
lineup
im
a
fan
of
hoppy
stouts
the
hop
presence
is
very
strong
the
coffeeespressoburnt
flavors
are
as
well
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
intense
flavored
beer
im
enjoying
it
and
have
no
reservation
recommending
it
d
really
liked
this
one
front
to
back
great
dessert
beer
and
might
be
even
better
for
breakfast
only
downside
is
the
pricetag
11
99
as
far
as
coffee
stouts
go
this
can
hold
up
to
the
best
of
them
i
like
this
a
lot
it
would
wake
me
up
a
lot
faster
than
the
other
beer
geek
beers
if
i
actually
drank
it
for
breakfast
but
there
is
no
way
id
have
beer
this
complex
that
early
in
the
day
great
variation
on
an
already
great
beer
series
o
delicious
and
definitely
improves
as
it
warms
i
dont
like
hoppy
beers
but
this
is
great
another
awesome
brew
from
mikkeller
o
very
interesting
cornucopia
of
flavors
that
put
an
allout
assault
on
the
senses
as
i
got
used
to
the
beer
i
found
it
more
drinkable
disguise
any
alcohol
very
well
it
is
a
mouthful
its
alright
mediumbodied
a
lot
to
like
or
dislike
but
there
certainly
is
a
lot
of
flavor
cool
experiment
id
maybe
tone
down
the
bitterness
a
bit
more
not
sure
what
else
id
do
fun
and
beastly
o
this
is
an
awesome
hoppy
stout
probably
my
favorite
offering
so
far
from
mikkeller
second
bottle
thanks
to
jon
big
hops
like
a
black
ipa
but
not
cascadian
pours
a
completely
opaque
pitch
black
light
brown
head
with
some
big
bubbles
around
the
edges
nose
starts
with
some
big
hop
notes
pine
and
pineapple
at
the
forefront
coffee
and
espresso
make
themselves
visible
closer
to
the
end
of
the
sensation
a
general
creaminesssweetness
as
well
taste
is
all
espresso
and
hops
with
great
interplay
between
the
two
each
sip
alternates
between
these
flavours
and
works
wonders
great
full
bodied
feel
to
it
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
share
this
truly
a
strange
creation
here
im
very
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
cant
imagine
ill
ever
buy
this
again
this
beer
is
deceptive
all
around
i
thought
it
smelled
well
balance
between
the
coffee
and
the
hops
turns
out
their
is
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
that
really
competes
with
the
coffee
the
beer
didnt
form
a
big
head
yet
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
then
its
dark
and
the
overall
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
tricky
tricky
mikkeller
overall
this
is
a
really
good
brew
i
loved
every
sip
while
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
geek
but
still
better
than
most
other
coffee
beers
out
there
pick
one
up
and
feel
free
to
drink
it
anytime
kind
of
like
how
breakfast
can
be
eaten
at
any
time
o
the
medium
body
and
hop
character
are
more
akin
to
some
of
the
black
ipas
floating
around
than
a
hopstout
but
in
that
regard
id
rate
it
as
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
ever
had
overall
a
well
executed
play
on
the
style
id
say
grab
all
four
in
the
line
if
you
can
having
them
together
is
a
treat
the
way
each
of
these
beers
distinguish
themselves
is
remarkable
and
each
has
a
unique
offering
personally
id
put
the
beer
hop
breakfast
second
in
the
lineup
just
short
of
the
brunch
weasel
o
a
definite
winner
from
mikkeller
with
a
great
flavoured
offering
i
would
certainly
drink
this
stuff
for
breakfast
it
is
the
most
important
meal
of
the
day
d
an
interesting
stout
not
had
an
american
version
yet
and
this
was
enjoyable
not
overly
hopped
with
roasted
malts
notes
working
well
with
a
subtle
coffee
hint
overall
interesting
styleflavor
profile
nice
to
try
once
but
definitely
prefer
the
regular
beer
geek
breakfast
another
good
breakfast
stout
from
mikkeller
nice
coffee
flavor
but
too
bitter
for
me
to
love
this
beer
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
thoroughly
and
plan
on
on
going
to
buy
another
now
this
is
a
great
mikkeller
beer
as
good
or
better
than
beer
geek
breakfast
i
would
buy
this
one
again
and
again
stick
to
the
regular
beer
geek
breakfast
if
you
have
never
tried
mr
mikkellers
stout
before
what
we
have
here
is
a
failure
to
um
well
a
failure
to
differentiate
between
a
silky
oatmeal
coffee
stout
and
the
american
ipaization
of
such
bully
for
me
i
likes
em
both
just
fine
bottle
poured
into
matilda
glass
pours
thick
black
with
small
mocha
head
that
fades
to
a
collar
very
nice
lacing
smell
is
average
lots
of
slightly
stale
coffee
some
noble
hops
a
touch
of
roasted
malts
taste
is
a
lot
better
then
the
smell
but
nothing
special
coffee
bakers
chocolate
hop
bitterness
that
carries
no
other
hop
characteristics
some
earthy
hops
and
roasted
malts
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
and
to
active
of
a
carbonation
not
as
silky
as
i
would
expect
from
an
oatmeal
stout
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
worth
the
hefty
price
tag
but
i
suppose
it
delivers
what
it
advertises
hoppy
coffee
stout
overall
im
not
in
love
with
this
beer
the
roast
and
the
hops
seem
to
be
fighting
for
my
attention
i
prefer
the
less
hoppy
versions
of
the
mikkeller
breakfast
stout
overall
hoppy
stout
and
porters
are
the
new
it
beers
that
said
there
are
many
other
breweries
doing
better
interpretations
o
the
beer
is
interesting
in
that
it
somewhat
tastes
like
a
hybrid
between
a
stout
and
an
ipa
although
the
stout
properties
are
much
more
prevalent
o
overall
this
is
the
weakest
in
the
beer
breakfast
series
in
my
opinion
i
was
really
hoping
for
a
hoppy
stout
a
la
darkness
but
instead
the
hops
serve
mostly
to
bitter
and
dry
out
an
otherwise
nice
stout
looks
amazing
but
a
bit
of
a
let
down
from
there
you
are
way
better
off
going
for
a
beer
geek
breakfast
or
a
beer
geek
brunch
weasel
i
am
however
excited
to
see
more
of
these
beers
showing
up
on
shelves
and
i
will
continue
to
try
as
many
as
i
can
this
is
a
killer
example
of
the
style
at
hand
the
hops
werent
as
strong
as
i
thought
going
by
the
title
which
i
thought
meant
a
ton
of
hops
but
it
did
not
take
away
from
the
overall
taste
i
highly
recommend
this
as
a
replacement
for
your
morning
cup
o
joe
not
overly
complex
but
it
still
works
for
me
this
time
around
the
contrast
of
whats
going
on
is
poetic
in
how
beautifully
it
all
works
together
this
is
a
fantastic
hoppy
stout
that
not
only
does
justice
to
the
style
but
is
an
exemplar
of
how
to
do
it
properly
this
is
really
good
its
thick
its
hoppy
as
hell
really
great
pour
an
color
the
aroma
smells
of
big
time
hops
chocolate
malts
and
some
burnt
aromas
too
the
beer
is
silky
smooth
and
oily
the
aftertaste
is
of
oats
and
toast
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
really
strong
black
ipa
i
highly
enjoy
the
combination
of
hops
and
imperial
stout
d
an
interesting
beer
though
it
might
not
please
everyone
who
likes
a
classic
stout
still
its
very
drinkable
d
this
one
is
just
as
the
bottle
promises
a
very
hoppy
stout
it
loses
some
of
the
smoothness
that
comes
with
being
an
oatmeal
stout
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
beer
not
sure
that
i
could
have
any
more
than
one
500ml
is
perfect
an
interesting
mix
of
a
big
stout
with
a
hop
bomb
this
ones
worth
looking
for
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
o
a
killer
hoppy
stout
the
batch
that
just
hit
chicago
is
super
fresh
and
im
thinking
i
just
might
go
back
to
buy
another
m
nice
well
rounded
this
is
friggin
awesome
if
you
like
big
americanstyle
imperial
stouts
packed
with
bitter
hops
really
well
done
drinkability
is
great
good
balance
between
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
but
with
just
buckets
of
hop
character
on
top
great
depth
to
the
hop
character
wow
odd
to
find
a
stout
that
is
such
an
ode
to
the
hop
but
it
is
damn
good
stuff
d
an
interesting
beer
value
for
money
isnt
great
and
sessionability
is
low
due
to
the
bitterness
as
a
stout
man
i
would
have
it
again
though
so
thats
worth
something
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
red
highlights
and
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
great
i
get
a
lot
of
caramel
and
roasted
malt
with
some
pine
and
citrus
hops
the
flavor
is
roastedburnt
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
but
i
also
get
a
lot
of
bitter
pine
and
orange
notes
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
hoppy
stout
this
brew
pours
a
dark
cola
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
coffee
laced
two
finger
frothy
head
and
some
sporadic
lacingthe
aromas
are
fruity
hops
mixed
with
dark
coccoa
and
coffeeit
has
a
rather
lucious
mouthfeel
which
is
well
carbonated
and
coats
the
mouth
with
flavours
of
coffeedark
coccoamocha
and
finishes
with
a
fruityhoppy
kick
and
for
me
i
love
this
brew
its
definately
an
interesting
combination
but
mikkeller
pulls
it
off
well
as
i
like
my
oatmeal
stouts
and
really
hoppy
brews
so
this
is
a
beautiful
combination
of
both
and
i
highly
recommend
and
obviously
i
will
revisit
this
brew
as
much
as
possible
absolutely
love
it
i
like
the
original
beer
geek
breakfast
but
the
bitterness
from
the
coffee
doesnt
play
well
with
the
hops
it
just
gets
overwhelming
had
problems
finishing
12
bottle
smells
fantastic
imo
cedary
floral
and
some
grapefruity
hoppiness
over
some
chocolatey
maltiness
bits
of
roastedness
pop
through
the
aroma
and
then
down
to
some
resiny
hops
lovely
stuff
taste
follows
along
the
same
lines
but
the
hops
and
chocolate
tones
dont
come
together
as
well
as
in
the
aroma
interesting
interplay
but
the
roasted
qualities
get
lost
a
little
still
nice
stuff
medium
to
thinner
mf
about
the
same
as
a
regular
beergeek
breakfast
with
some
softer
carbonation
a
sipping
brew
but
not
due
to
the
weight
interesting
brew
that
could
almost
as
easily
be
classified
as
a
black
ipa
in
some
ways
at
least
when
fresh
unusual
coffee
flavor
overwhelms
too
much
resulting
in
overly
bitter
taste
my
least
favorite
sierra
nevada
beer
coffee
is
the
dominant
note
as
advertised
a
bit
creamy
on
the
nose
and
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
otherwise
a
run
of
the
mill
stout
o
mostly
excellent
but
a
shade
too
bitter
o
4

this
is
a
really
nice
beer
all
around
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
style
not
a
coffee
drinker
but
i
love
coffee
beers
this
one
is
a
hit
on
the
visual
appeal
the
nose
is
great
the
taste
is
good
and
the
mouthfeel
is
also
good
overall
a
great
beer
to
grab
and
enjoy
the
flavor
also
changes
as
it
warms
it
moves
in
a
more
coffee
like
direction

o
like
a
good
strong
cup
of
black
coffee
in
the
morning
this
one
doesnt
mess
around
pretty
well
done
overall
the
aroma
is
the
highlight
better
than
the
taste
o
coffee
aroma
is
nice
but
the
bitterness
of
this
beer
is
overwhelming
out
of
balance
would
be
interesting
to
try
it
again
a
few
months
later
an
excellent
coffee
stout
not
thats
any
surprise
rich
coffe
dry
stout
very
good
s
nice
notes
of
coffee
and
cocoa
l
pitch
black
with
a
brownish
off
white
head
t
roasted
coffee
cocoa
raisins
and
all
three
combined
to
have
a
nice
balance
sweetness
with
the
mild
bitterness
of
the
beer
f
smooth
mild
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
overall
a
good
american
stout
the
flavor
profile
is
quite
nice
and
is
intense
slightly
complex
and
somewhat
balanced
although
coffee
dominates
it
begins
with
a
blend
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
that
slowly
allows
detection
of
the
chocolate
the
middle
has
a
subtle
caramel
note
under
the
coffee
a
mild
roasthop
bitterness
is
also
present
in
the
middle
the
finish
is
slightly
sweet
then
fades
into
a
lingering
coffee
flavor
that
is
somewhat
stale
o
a
great
coffee
stout
definitely
worth
trying
perfect
for
breakfast
a
rare
miss
for
me
from
sn
o
better
than
i
expected
nice
creamy
quality
complements
the
semisweet
coffee
taste
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
it
would
be
great
if
snbc
made
this
a
winter
seasonal
every
year
snowpack
was
a
great
value
this
year
glad
i
picked
it
up
deep
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
great
iceberg
looking
head
and
thick
lacing
clinging
everywhere
aroma
is
of
deep
roasted
coffee
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
maltiness
taste
hits
first
with
the
chocolate
and
then
bitter
coffee
there
is
a
pleasurable
sweetness
to
the
first
taste
and
then
all
balances
well
with
the
coffee
and
such
kinda
tastes
like
a
european
heavy
roasted
coffee
with
cream
added
nice
mouthfeel
is
clingy
thick
and
chewy
and
the
finish
is
of
heavily
roasted
coffee
super
bitter
black
as
night
over
the
top
coffee
putrid
dreck
feels
not
smooth
taste
yucky
dumped
it
this
was
a
nice
surprise
definitely
coffee
on
the
nose
and
palate
not
extremely
balanced
but
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
black
as
night
and
no
light
will
penetrate
this
brew
i
have
an
inch
of
light
brown
tightly
packed
foam
on
top
nice
brussels
lacing
aroma
of
dark
roast
coffee
dominates
the
flavor
is
initially
bitter
dark
black
coffee
and
then
the
overwhelming
bitter
dar
coffee
flavor
kicks
into
overdrive
just
shy
of
surly
coffee
better
intense
the
body
is
creamyslightly

dry
great
characters
of
a
stout
with
a
awesome
roasty
coffee
flavor
best
part
of
the

pack
delicious
huge

as
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
packs
the
same
with
give
and
take
in
sweetness
and
bitterness
maybe
a
touch
of
prune
i
love
this
and
hope
its
offered
again
definitely
a
great
coffee
stout
absolutely
delicious
the
aroma
is
freaking
amazing
and
it
looks
gorgeous
upon
pouring
the
flavor
is
great
as
well
though
it
doesnt
follow
the
nose
for
long
and
soon
loses
some
of
the
flavors
one
would
expect
from
a
coffee
stout
theres
still
plenty
of
roasted
malt
and
bitter
hops
and
the
texture
is
really
smooth
with
some
crispness
from
the
carbonation
so
its
still
quite
enjoyable
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
pours
a
deep
black
and
with
light
barely
see
through
ruby
color
head
went
away
quick
and
left
a
normal
lace
had
a
fresh
espresso
scent
with
maybe
a
hint
of
a
milk
stout
creamy
going
in
creamy
going
down
with
a
dry
finish
and
a
bit
of
bitter
there
is
a
fresh
coffeeespresso
overtone
but
the
real
winner
is
the
balance
sweetand
again
almost
a
milk
stout
that
has
the
right
bitter
raisin
notes
overall
this
seems
like
another
standard
for
the
style
not
overdone
but
not
a
weakling
o
a
little
harsh
nice
dark
pour
with
off
white
creamy
rocky
head
and
moderate
lacing
nice
aroma
of
espresso
malt
and
hints
of
dark
chocolate
nice
flavor
of
espresso
mixed
with
notes
of
tobacco
medium
body
and
creamy
with
a
slightly
oily
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
stickiness
on
the
back
end
overall
this
is
better
than
the
best
coffee
ive
had
and
i
like
good
coffee
o
overall
very
tasty
quite
a
nice
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
and
while
it
might
not
be
as
wonderful
as
some
of
the
impy
stouts
with
coffee
for
everyday
drinking
this
beer
is
pretty
fantastic
overall
this
is
an
excellent
stout
another
winner
from
sierra
nevada
this
is
no
uncommon
stout
a
hoppy
coffee
to
be
sure
o
a
really
nice
coffee
stout
great
almost
outstanding
in
my
book
its
definitely
good
enough
that
i
wish
it
was
a
year
round
offering
although
i
wonder
how
viable
that
would
be
considering
they
already
offer
their
standard
american
stout
either
way
its
a
very
nice
beer
and
one
that
you
should
try
and
get
if
you
are
into
the
sweetmilkcoffee
stouts

overall
a
very
flavorful
coffee
stout
that
has
the
typical
sn
hop
presence
great
beer
a
promising
beer
from
the
initial
senses
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
in
the
feel
hurt
my
overall
enjoyment
from
the
lofty
beginning
still
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
when
your
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
at
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
could
feel
a
slight
warming
sensation
buy
by
no
means
was
this
a
typical
stout
the
strength
wasnt
really
here
and
there
werent
notes
of
licorice
black
sambuca
or
bitter
chocolate
as
in
so
many
others
the
dark
chocolate
lent
a
good
dessertlike
feel
to
this
and
this
was
almost
like
a
cream
stout
that
trended
on
the
richer
side
a
solid
offering
form
sierra
nevada
thats
in
line
with
many
of
their
other
beers
not
the
best
example
of
their
given
style
but
a
hallmark
thats
nearly
impossible
to
dislike
fun
stuff
extremely
pleasant
not
overpowering
silky
smooth
perfect
beer
for
a
snowy
winter
night
boring
really
just
nothing
special
kinda
watery
good
but
not
has
intense
as
i
expected
dark
brown
with
ruby
edges
there
is
some
nice
roast
and
obviously
coffee
notes
in
the
nose
the
coffee
flavors
mesh
well
with
the
roasted
malts
the
finish
is
nicely
bitter
from
both
the
roast
and
the
generous
hoppiness

this

a

this
was
the

champion
of
the

seasonal
sampler
its
called
coffee
stout
for
a
reason
because
wow
what
a
great
coffee
taste
and
aroma
this
one
has
perfect
hop
balance
just
enough
to
let
you
know
its
there

not

the
main
characters
coffee

wouldnt

theres

coldpressed
coffee

which
feels

it
most
definitely
tastes
like
a
delicious
cup
of
high
grade
black
coffee
it
has
medium
to
high
carbonation
but
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
flavor
its
just
lightweight
enough
to
not
be
too
filling
but
dark
and
heavy
enough
to
know
im
drinking
a
stout
mostly
due
to
the
pleasant

can
spy
some
carbonation

the

absolutely

definitely
a
winter
warmer
just
added
this
one
too
my
list
of
beers
that
i
get
for
traditions
sake
every
winter
had
this
poured
into
a
stout
glass
my
tenth
sierra
nevada
review
the
color
was
a
very
very
dark
brown
inviting
in
the
winter
the
taste
is
nice
and
smooth
as
youd
like
for
a
stout
not
as
much
coffee
flavor
as
id
hoped
for
though
worth
a
shot
o
i
would
say
a
slightly
above
average
coffee
stout
i
expected
more
in
the
aroma
but
this
could
have
been
due
to
the
onset
of
a
cold
i
was
also
given
a
frosted
pint
glass
which
may
have
been
the
reason
the
head
stuck
to
it
as
i
drank
and
a
bottle
that
i
felt
was
way
too
cold
for
this
beer
leaving
me
to
want
to
rereview
this
another
time
under
better
circumstances
a
very
drinkable
stout
medium
bodied
smooth
with
an
appealing
coffee
flavor
beer
and
cheddar
bisque
o
a
nice
stout
full
of
cold
coffee
and
bittersweet
cocoa
delivered
at
a
modest
abv
overall
a
damn
nice
beer
i
hope
they
make
this
one
a
regular
item
o
a
notch
below
founders
breakfast
stout
but
hey
thats
the
gold
standard
for
coffee
stouts
in
my
book
this
beer
is
mighty
tasty
and
should
be
made
available
in
six
packs
serving
type
bottle
a
really
good
stout
with
just
a
hint
of
coffee
really
good
after
a
nice
meal
on
a
cold
day
part
of
a
winter
assortment
12er
from
sn
who
never
disappoints
popping
the
top
i
get
a
smell
of
sweet
fresh
brewed
coffee
pours
into
my
trusty
sapp
to
a
motor
oil
color
with
a
guinesslike
cascading
mutlicolor
transitioning

the
head
clings
and
reiains
a
trasition

on
the
taste
this
brew
has
a
great
standout
coffee
bitter
flavor
with
a
slightly
sweet
malt
in
the
background
transitioning
to
a
drier
chaulky
bitterness
that
then
lingers
through
the
aftertaste
this
brew
is
not
overly
sweet
and
has
outstanding
coffee
accent
another
good
job
by
sn
who
always
pleases

the

i

pulled
this
out

it
was
the

of
the

i
really
hope
they
make
this
one
into
a
seasonal
offering
all
to
itself
its
a
damn
good
stout
and
you
cannot
beat
the
price
i
honestly
dont
know
how
sierra
nevada
keeps
doing
this
i
have
recently
purchased
a
few
of
their
high
end
stouts
and
because
of
the
size
i
want
to
share
them
but
if
this
is
any
indication
i
have
a
feeling

be

o

really
enjoyed
this
lots
of

and
dark

flavors
i
hope
sierra

offers
this
as
a
winter
seasonal
o
a
very
nice
coffee
stout
that
combines
coffee
chocolate
and
fruit
notes
very
well
easy
to
drink
while
remaining
complex
and
thick
enough
to
be
a
sipper
definitely
a
great
winter
brew
at
a
great
value
in
the
mix
pack
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
pretty
much
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
dry
on
the
finish
not
filling
at
all
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
these
and
i
cant
say
that
for
many
coffee
stouts
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
how
true
to
style
it
was
and
the
drinkability
i
thought
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
body
i
wish
it
was
just
a
little
thicker
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
it
would
be
nice
to
be
able
to
buy
this
on
its
own
and
i
think
it
makes
for
a
great
cold
weather
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
coffee
stouts
its
for
sure
worth
a
try
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
good
coffee
stout
and
i
think
it
can
hold
its
own
in
the
style
but
founders
breakfast
stout
is
till
my
favorite
of
the
style
and
it
isnt
my
favorite
sierra
nevada
beer
but
i
do
think
its
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
them
good
job
guys
this
was
a
tasty
coffee
stout
and
i
think
you
guys
made
a
good
move
putting
this
in
the
winter
variety
pack
keep
up
the
good
work
great
beer
for
what
it
is
strong
coffee
nose
coffee
forward
coffee
aftertaste
mocha
colored
head
with
dark
coffee
color
you
can
taste
sweet
malt
back
there
but
definitely
one
for
fans
of
coffee
coffee
stouts
seem
to
be
a
bit
of
a
fad
right
now
it
puts
me
in
a
bit
of
a
paradox
should
i
be
drinking
it
in
the
morning
or
at
night
oh
what
the
hell
its
all
good
in
this
case
pours
out
jet
black
and
leaves
a
small
mocha
head
that
dissipates
rather
fast
while
leaving
beautiful
lacing
down
the
glass
nice
and
roasty
up
front
with
a
rich
coffee
toffee
earthy
sweetness
and
slight
dark
fruit
when
trying
it
for
the
first
time
you
get
the
roasted
bitterness
like
the
nose
then
you
pick
up
the
sweet
toffee
nuttiness
earthy
hops
then
in
the
finish
i
s
some
strong
lingering
coffee
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
to
light
and
seems
rather
slick
and
dry
i
like
my
stouts
a
little
fuller
bodied
then
this
overall
this
is
a
really
strong
tasting
coffee
stout
not
shying
away
from
the
full
flavor
of
coffee
here
not
the
best
stout
but
an
enjoyable
one
at
that
if
you
like
coffee
and
stouts
look
out
for
sierra
nevadas
snow
pack
cheers
dark
cola
looking
opaque
with
a
fluffy
head
nice
lacing
to
the
end
smell
is
certainly
coffee
with
some
cocoa
and
caramel
flavor
is
like
a
cold
cup
of
espresso
with
a
bit
of
the
chocolate
flavors
as
well
a
some
sweet
caramel
and
roasty
dark
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
i
expected
for
such
a
dark
stout
but
very
clean
and
creamy
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
hope
that
sierra
nevada
makes
this
a
yearround
offering
everything
else
about
this
brew
is
close
enough
to
spot
on
as
to
be
a
reference
for
the
style
but
the
singular
aspect
that
made
my
evening
is
the
aroma
at
first
whiff
beautifully
rich
dark
full
bodied
scent
of
freshly
ground
beans
if
you
dont
drink
it
you
really
should
at
least
smell
it
nice
job
sn
excellent
coffee
stout
try
this
now
this
tastes
like
a
coffee
stout
should
like
roasted
coffee
not
a
lot
of
nuance
or
complexity
just
strong
roast
there
is
some
chocolate
malt
and
i
might
have
found
a
bit
of
caramel
but
the
coffee
is
huge
my
only
complaint
is
that
this
is
a
bit
too
thin
for
a
stout
but
it
doesnt
weigh
on
your
stomach
m
fairly
thick
with
mediumlow
carbonation
how
a
stout
should
be
i
didnt
get
as
much
coffee
out
of
this
as
i
had
hoped
for
but
thats
about
my
only
real
critique
of
an
otherwise
beautiful
beer
i
think
because
their
hoppy
stuff
is
so
good
that
sierra
nevada
gets
overlooked
for
their
dark
beer
sometimes
not
fair
this
is
really
good
obsidian
black
with
a
similar
shine
and
over
an
inch
of
lasting
mocha
bubble
lace
on
top
more
roast
than
coffee
on
the
nose
although
the
coffee
is
there
in
the
back
with
a
dried
fruit
character
to
it
im
surprised
the
body
is
as
light
as
it
is
not
to
say
its
light
but
that
its
not
thick
and
heavy
like
stouts
can
be
not
sure
if
i
dig
that
or
not
but
it
is
immediately
noticeable
dark
chalky
malts
meet
some
caramel
sweetness
in
the
middle
its
very
well
rounded
in
its
grain
base
the
coffee
is
subtle
and
its
all
in
the
finish
i
could
stand
to
see
this
ramped
up
just
a
bit
but
i
like
it
as
an
accent
flavor
too
the
beer
tastes
rich
but
feels
quite
delicate
lending
to
drinkability
nice
cold
weather
beer
i
always
like
the
one
off
stuff
in
these
mix
boxes
they
do
this
is
a
good
one
o
man
this
is
a
great
coffee
stout
i
really
hope
they
keep
making
this
one
and
its
not
exclusive
to
the
snowpack
o
lovely
take
on
the
coffee
stout
this
one
offers
a
decent
kick
and
solid
full
feel
to
couple
with
the
strong
powerful
flavors
hope
well
see
this
one
again
soon
overall
real
good
beer
some
of
the
best
coffee
ive
had
in
a
beer
light
easy
drinking
very
solid
i
relearned
my
lesson
from
the
previous
debacle
and
began
backing
off
of
my
heavyhanded
pour
a
little
earlier
this
time
i
still
created
a
nice
pseudocascade
which
developed
into
almost
precisely
three

i

i

o
if
someone
asked
what
a

is
this
is

nothing
extraordinary
here
but
very
well
crafted
overall
this
is
exactly
how
i
want
a
coffee
stout
to
taste
well
balanced
and
loads
of
coffee
flavor

overall
a
solid
coffee
stout
i
wish
they
made
this
in
a
six
pack
this
is
a
good
stout
and
a
decent
coffee
stout
i
dont
think
its
anything
special
its
wellcrafted
consistent
and
drinkable
o
a
very
good
beer
i
do
actually
prefer
the
regular
sn
stout
over
this
one
though
as
its
a
little
sweeter
and
creamier
the
taste
has
bittersweet
cocoa
flavor
with
dark
burnt
brownie
crust
up
front
and
a
kind
of
roast
coffee
flavor
with
sweet
malt
combination
and
slight
dark
sugar
and
bittterness
of
hops
or
dark
malt
i
am
not
sure
which
the
flavor
is
intenslely
roasted
in
the
long
finish
with
mild
sweetness
trading
off
with
mild
bitter
taste
in
the
mostly
dry
finish
this
is
a
quality
coffee
stout
with
light
hop
bitterness
which
adds
a
nice
balancevery
drinkable
as
expected
from
sierra
nevada
with
plenty
of
coffee
flavor
yet
you
still
taste
the
base
stout
which
is
great
simple
coffee
stout
really
nice
roasty
coffee
character
followed
by
a
slight
sweetness
really
liking
this
o
a
straight
forward
coffee
stout
that
packs
plenty
of
coffee
flavor
while
remaining
very
drinkable
well
done
this
is
a
great
beer
i
get
a
very
aromatic
smell
of
iced
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
the
taste
even
better
very
nice
carbonation
on
the
tongue
up
front
which
makes
it
thirst
quenching
and
wanting
more
then
the
coffee
and
the
same
malts
they
use
in
their
porter
come
together
to
make
an
amazing
iced
coffee
beer
they
should
definitely
put
this
in
six
packs
and
make
it
year
round
perfect
body
not
watery
at
all
the
body
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
compare
with
higher
alcohol
coffee
stous
or
stouts
in
general
its
great
to
see
a
brewery
that
thrives
on
hop
forward
beers
absolutely
nail
a
darker
beer
tastes
like
beer
tastes
like
coffee
i
can
drink
a
few
of
them
overall
while
pretty
basic
it
hits
the
mark
its
by
no
means
the
best
coffee
stout
out
there
but
it
satisfies
in
every
way
extremely
dominant
coffee
taste
but
not
too
creamy
notes
of
milk
chocolate
to
follow
great
at
first
sip
but
it
does
the
opposite
of
grow
on
me
o
excellent
coffee
beer
this
one
makes
the
snow
pack
worth
the
purchase
for
sure
i
would
get
this
beer
again
its
like
their
world
class
stout
through
a
randall
filled
with
coffee
beans
great
beer
clean
and
dry
in
finish
the
stouts
full
carbonation
lifts
the
sweetness
from
the
palate
and
promotes
an
arid
coffeelike
closure
upon
the
palate
leaving
behind
a
slight
roasty
peppery
and
tannic
bite
the
aftertaste
is
awash
with
cocoa
and
faint
ash
glass
snifter
overall
sn
nailed
this
one
a
very
tasty
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
before
enjoying
the
flavors
pop
as
it
starts
to
warm
with
the
current
popularity
of
flavored
stouts
i
have
a
feeling
sn
would
sell
the
shit
out
of
this
if
they
released
it
outside
of
a
variety
pack
overall
very
nice
coffee
stout
and
at
a
great
price
which
is
par
for
the
course
for
sn
taste
is
bold
coffee
with
plenty
of
cocoa
notes
as
well
and
some
trace
of
dark
fruit
underneath
the
palate
roasty
dark
and
full
to
the
brim
with
flavor
this
is
a
lovely
brew
for
either
morning
or
night
overall
it
seems
like
most
coffee
beers
are
either
5
abv
beers
which
seem
watery
with
all
the
coffee
or
massive
imperial
stouts
it
is
great
to
have
something
in
between
a
very
well
done
stout
great
balance
between
roasty
and
sweet
notes

overall

5sierra
nevada
never
disappoints
me
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
my
relatively
low
score
is
simply
because
i
do
not
like
the
coffee
stout
style
who
wants
to
drink
a
nearly
7
beer
in
the
morning
other
than
jim
morrison
or
conversely
who
wants
to
have
a
coffee
buzz
while
drinking
beer
at
night
regardless
this
came
with
the
sample
pack
and
i
tried
it
out
and
was
not
a
big
fan
hope
you
are
picked
up
the
snow
pack
largely
because
of
this
and
it
didnt
disappoint
id
really
like
this
to
be
a
more
frequent
release
in
six
packs
maybe
to
replace
one
of
their
lackluster
seasonal
ipas
all
of
them
other
than
celebration
love
this
my
favorite
of
the
snowpack
it
reminds
a
bit
of
breakfast
stout
in
its
coffee
character
this
is
what
i
want
in
a
sessionnonimperial
stout
lots
of
coffee
and
chocolate
yet
very
drinkable
and
relatively
light
bodied
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
tons
of

the
right
amount
of
roast
a
nice

flavor
very
creamy
and
smooth
a
steal
at
a

a

overall
a
very
good

good
mix
of

with

overall
freshness
is
popping
drink
these
coffee
stouts
while
fresh
pure
excellence
in
my
glass
im
shocked
at
the
quality
of
this
beer
i
will
be
seeking
out
another
12
pack
overall
a
commendable
coffee
stout
from
sierra
doesnt
quite
break
the
mold
and
stand
out
from
the
pack
but
its
rather
enjoyable
its
a
hard
style
to
screw
up
but
even
harder
to
make
a
truly
outstanding
example
so
theres
no
shame
in
this
one
if
youre
a
coffee
stout
lover
youll
want
to
try
this
one
1
to
those
who
regard
this
as
the
essence
of
the
american
stout
im
searching
for
beers
that
i
call
elemental
that
represent
ideals
from
which
other
beers
are
concocted
as
mixturescompounds
this
just
may
be
the
elemental
american
stout
and
its
available
at
fantastic
price
for
the
brilliance
that
youre
getting
here
its
a
nearperfect
balance
of
smooth
creamy
and
bold
i
salute
sierra
nevada
for
the
continuing
great
quality
of
the
older
staple
beers
even
as
the
marketing
arm
seems
to
be
convinced
that
appealing
to
hopheads
is
the
way
to
go
and
id
suggest
that
marketing
this
stout
as
their
3
grocery
store
beer
after
pale
ale
and
seasonal
hopheavy
beer
instead
of
another
hopheavy
variety
would
be
beneficial
to
sales
in
the
long
run
delicious
and
smooth
very
easy
drinking
with
some
hops
flavor
noticeable
m
mediumlow
carbonation
a
little
thin
in
the
middle
full
but
clean
finish
very
drinkable
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
finest
beers
look
this
beer
is
awesome
it
is
in
every
way
an
exemplary
stout
its
just
solid
no
frills
just
an
allaround
excellent
stout
dont
assume
youve
had
this
unless
you
have
a
very
precise
recollection
of
drinking
it
you
may
not
have
had
this
and
if
this
is
the
case
my
advice
to
you
is
to
not
let
this
beauty
pass
you
by
nice
mild
chocolatey
and
roasty
aromas
i
pronounce
it
good
very
drinkable
good
finish
one
i
will
surely
buy
again
comes
across
as
pretty
basic
but
solid
nonetheless
overall
a
nicely
balanced
stout
without
any
off
flavors
or
quirks
not
terribly
distinctive
either
mild
and
not
too
bitter
hops
profile
drinkable
a
bit
richer
and
less
bitter
than
the
sn
porter
note
that
this
one
was
in
the
bottle
for
5
months
which
might
explain
the
milder
hops
disappointing
stout
from
sierra
nevada
ive
had
plenty
of
much
nicer
stouts
it
isnt
unpleasant
simply
underwhelming
this
is
a
solid
stout
the
dark
malt
characters
are
exceptional
roasty
and
deep
evolving
complexity
i
enjoy
the
malt
so
much
that
i
wish
the
hops
werent
as
heavy
in
the
flavor
for
me
its
too
much
hop
flavor
for
a
stout
but
that
malt
flavor
keeps
me
drinking
its
definitely
a
solid
pick
it
may
he
the
best
yearround
available
stout
in
its
pleasingly
low
price
point
very
well
made
beer
by
our
chico
friends
not
spectacular
when
you
are
used
to
drink
barrel
aged
imperial
stouts
but
nevertheless
a
good
beer
doesnt
live
up
to
the
brothers
rating
for
me
its
good
allaround
but
nothing
special
on
the
nose
and
a
little
too
hoppy
and
bitter
at
the
finish
for
my
taste
without
the
richness
before
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
choose
it
over
many
in
the
style
if
given
the
choice
very
tasty
stout
nice
blend
of
flavor

a

well
done

this
is
a

great

delicious
simple

yet

about

i
love
going
back
to
this
classic
stout
bitter
for
a
stout
in
my
opinion
i
drank
from
the
bottle
vs
glass
so
that
may
have
contributed
an
underrated
beer
in
my
opinion
while
purposefully
not
as
strong
in
malty
sweetness
or
hops
as
an
imperial
stout
the
mixture
of
flavors
is
rather
brilliant
recommended
o
very
solid
straight
forward
stout
o
a
great
example
of
what
a
more
subdued
porter
can
be
not
everything
has
to
be
high
abv
or
aged
in
barrels
simplicity
can
be
effective
as
well
an
awesome
beer
that
highlights
everything
right
with
sierra
nevada
so
much
flavor
and
perfect
balance
hard
to
believe
its
a
5
8
abv
beer
for
the
money
there
is
not
a
better
american
stout
v
medium
value
not
too
expensive
not
too
cheap
either
seems
about
right
for
their
take
on
a
stout
very
bitter
for
a
stout
not
for
me
pours
dark
with
a
nice
creamy

smells
of
burnt

with

of
burnt

with
a
mild
hoppy
aftertaste
has
some
depth
little
creamy
mouthfeel
with
some
carbonation
with
a
nice
finish
overall
a
very
nice
stout
one
of
my
first
stouts
a
little
watery
decent
stout
but
honestly
very
disappointed
pretty
flavorless
and
very
light
aromas
makes
this
beer
a
let
down
not
the
worst
but
will
not
buy
again
i
much
prefer
the
sierra
nevada
porter
this
one
was
too
hoppy
for
my
tastes
more
like
a
porter
blended
with
snpa
killer
just
wish
the
abv
was
a
little
higher
a
6
5
would
be
fantastic
but
its
still
really
good
its
a
goto
from
what
i
could
gather
the
porter
and
stout
have
very
similar
taste
profiles
the
stout
is
smoother
and
creamier
while
the
porter
is
more
crisp
and
a
tad
bit
sour
pretty
good
better
than
a
lot
of
stouts
not
so
much
a
liquid
hershey
bar
still
sticks
to
the
sierra
nevada
corporate
general
flavor
which
is
very
good
indeed
o
excellent
stout
lives
up
to
my
expectations
a
great
halfway
point
between
the
best
of
british
stouts
that
generally
top
out
at
5
abv
and
the
mighty
imperial
us
stouts
wish
this
one
was
available
from
supermarkets
in
the
uk
like
snpa
is
looking
back
i
had
to
bump
up
my
ratings
on
this
one
a
bit
a
very
solid
stout
that
fires
on
all
cylinders
and
washes
down
most
meals
very
well
at
the
time
of
my
first
rating
i
think
i
was
measuring
it
against
my
own
system
which
inappropriately
ranked
it
against
imperial
stouts
did
a
side
by
side
with
the
porter
for
1
25
this
is
a
great
brew
to
drink
on
those
cold
nights
for

means
70

it

along
with
a
subtle

fantastic
smooth

the

that

in

gentle

this
beer
wins
by
its
outstanding
balance
on
the

hand
its
not
too
far
away
from
their
porter
either
this
is
my
third
of
these
tonight
and
it
has
been
absolutely
great
this
beer
is
a
gem
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
that
is

on
the
alcohol
but
doesnt
compromise
on
flavor
this

is
a

fit
the
value
is

overall
a

i

would

this

one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
i
didnt
believe
the
hype
at

yes
it
is
that

if

want

that

an

but
you
dont
want
to
get
drunk
this
is
for
you
americans
often
overrate
their
own
beer
this
is
not
a
case
of
that
best
ive
had
so
far
from

perfectly

stout
however
not
overly
ambitious
which
is

on

quite
smooth
sort
of
creamy
very
little
bitterness
worth
a
try
but
no
asterisks
very
light
stout
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
combination
of
the
hop
character
of
an
american
ipa
with
the
fullness
and
roastiness
of
a
stout
i
personally
find
it
very
satisfying
as
all
the
best
qualities
of
both
styles
are
balanced
and
play
out
their
roles
admirably
overall
considering
the
bottled
on
date
this
has
stood
up
very
well
there
is
a
great
balance
between
roasted
flavor
cocoa
hops
and
malt
the
flavor
profile
hits
all
these
notes
and
has
a
nice
dry
finish
with
little
lingering
flavor
a
solid
stout
o
the
slight
bitterness
that
this
one
had
balances
out
the
sweetness
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
nice
overall
it
was
nice
to
see
this
beer
relatively
fresh
its
a
very
solid
stout
o
excellent
4

pleasantly
hefty
body
roasted
coffee
and
light
chocolate
with
a
bitter
and
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
what
a
stout
should
be
deep
black
color
with
a
thick
rich
long
lasting
tan
head
both
the
smell
and
taste
are
a
nice
combination
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
the
hop
bitterness
working
with
the
sweetness
to
provide
great
balance
rich
mouthfeel
almost
creamy
this
is
my
benchmark
for
what
an
american
stout
should
be
o
would
definitely
go
with
something
else
just
not
what
i
want
in
a
stout
however
we
all
know
that
beer
is
an
individual
thing
that
being
said
nothing
about
this
beer
is
exceptional
it
is
simply
a
solid
stout
for
the
money
pours
a
very
deep
dark
brown
in
color
and
is
close
to
being
pitch
black
looks
great
has
a
nice
1finger
beige
thick
head
a
good
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
that
sticks
to
the
inside
of
the
glass
also
perfect
carbonation
for
a
stout
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
for
the
most
part
but
nothing
else
the
taste
of
the
roasted
malts
comes
through
at
first
then
followed
up
by
a
very
bitter
aftertaste
almost
like
drinking
a
strong
i
p
a
india
pale
ale
after
a
few
more
sips
it
didnt
get
any
better
way
to
bitter
and
after
a
good
hour
i
ended
up
pouring
about
half
of
it
out
one
of
the
worst
stouts
i
had
drank
to
me
the
best
part
of
this
one
was
the
pour
and
look
in
the
glass
o
would
try
another
brand
if
i
was
in
mood
for
a
stout
pours
a
clear
black
exceptional
head
lacing
and
retention
light
nose
of
chocolate
roast
and
caramel
almost
full
bodied
yet
creamy
normal
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
very
well
balanced
but
not
as
complex
as
the
world
class
stouts
its
a
nice
blend
of
chocolate
roast
and
slightly
sweet
caramel
that
flows
into
a
low
level
bitterness
the
finish
is
smooth
leaving
you
with
a
nice
lingering
tingle
of
cocoa
and
hops
overall
every
time
i
have
more
of
this
the
more
i
like
it
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
solid
option
for
an
american
stout
and
well
worth
its
price
not
a
bad
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
too
many
others
taste
better
d
not
bad
color
and
smell
good
taste
not
so
much
complete
surprise
to
me
i
usually
love
sierra
nevada
but
this
too
many
better
choices
out
there
but
hardly
anyone
does
hops
like
sn
o
as
fine
a
budget
stout
as
likely
can
be
found
good
representation
of
the
style
mild
enough
to
be
a
good
dinner
brew
and
tasty
enough
to
be
a
pretty
good
sipper
overall
this
is
another
strong
offering
from
sierra
nevada
and
a
must
try
for
any
stout
lover
here
is
chicago
6ers
of
these
fly
off
the
shelves
fast
so
im
always
happy
to
pick
this
up
when
i
can
find
it
sierra
nevada
doesnt
make
a
bad
beer
and
its
nice
to
see
this
isnt
hopped
up
into
a
black
ipa
or
some
such
a
true
american
maltbomb
o
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
one
is
no
frills
and
straight
to
the
point
that
point
is
an
awesome
roasty
characteristic
with
enough
hoppiness
to
keep
things
interesting
o
very
well
brewed
beer
there
is
nothing
fancy
about
it
just
a
perfectly
brewed
stout
ranked
obsidian
the
highest
with
barney
flats
second
and
sn
stout
slightly
behind
in
third
final
thoughts
basically
i
need
to
try
this
one
a
bit
fresher
this
is
still
a
very
tasty
stout
but
the
flavors
on
it
seem
quite
subdued
almost
as
if
this
is
watered
downa
porter
i
will
definitely
need
to
revisit
this
when
its
either
ontap
or
in
a
fresher
notsodusty
bottle
at
this
moment
its
just
a
very
solid
stout
but
not
a
great
one
o
a
very
nice
stout
that
is
quite
flavorful
very
dark
black
beer
with
finger
of
tan
head
and
good
lacing
that
held
up
throughout
lots
of
chocolate
in
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
hops
flavor
is
typical
stout
chocolate
coffee
toffee
etc
medium
body
for
a
stout
not
spectacular
but
a
solid
drinkable
stout
my
fifth
offering
from
sierra
nevada
have
to
admit
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
light
body
for
a
stout
easy
burnt
raisin
flavor
not
to
heavy
on
the
malt
super
smooth
glides
down
the
back
of
the
throat
very
dark
brown
flavor
its
good
but
really
just
a
pretty
prototypical
stout
overall
this
is
a
good
traditional
no
frills
stout
its
smooth
and
very
approachable
although
i
prefer
robust
stouts
with
more
malt
and
dark
fruit
character
if
i
were
to
recommend
a
stout
to
someone
new
to
the
style
itd
be
this
o
a
really
drinkable
stout
and
a
really
fantastic
example
of
the
style
if
you
are
unfamiliar
with
stouts
this
one
would
be
a
great
introduction
also
dont
let
the
50
ibus
scare
you
as
it
really
does
not
taste
nearly
that
bitter
to
me
and
i
am
not
one
that
usually
takes
to
more
bitter
beers
do
yourself
a
favor
and
give
it
a
try
nice
stout
impressed
with
the
smoothness
of
it
its
a
stout
that
i
could
have
a
few
of
without
feeling
full
but
not
too
thin
as
to
loose
some
of
the
creamy
texture
wish
it
was
available
at
more
pubs
down
under
one
of
the
earliest
craft
stouts
to
be
brewed
and
a
terrific
one
at
that
o
tons
of
flavor
for
a
6
stout
a
classic
as
with
all
sierra
nevada
beers
well
crafted
always
a
safe
choice
there
is
a
kind
if
milk
chocolate
flavor
that
is
nice
and
relaxing
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
slight
bitterness
lingering
on
at
the
end
minimalist
hops
o
good
example
of
the
style
this
is
something
i
would
drink
again
like
all
sierra
nevada
beers
this
is
a
solid
contender
for
the
style
and
at
a
good
price
o
one
of
the
best
american
regular
stouts
nice
to
have
a
stout
that
isnt
above
9
alcohol
o
a
straightforward
but
wellmade
stout
that
shows
good
typicity
for
the
style
cheers
o
a
prime
example
of
a
stout
sierra
nevada
done
good
purchased
at
total
wine
in
naples
florida
for
7
49
a
6
pk
o
american
stout
or
american
black
ale
it
doesnt
matter
this
is
terrific
i
had
this
one
once
before
about
6
years
ago
in
my
beer
rookiedom
its
much
better
than
i
recall
happy
for
the
retaste
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
very
good
american
stout
by
sn
recommended
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
shelf
stout
especially
at
its
price
point
this
is
where
id
go
if
i
have
a
craving
for
an
americanstyle
stout
as
deschutes
doesnt
distribute
in
wisconsin
obsidian
stout
overall
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
smoother
balanced
and
flavorful
american
stout
at
just
under
6
its
not
a
big
monster
so
you
can
enjoy
a
few
bottles
world
class
and
really
underated
in
part
to
being
very
available
and
low
alcohol
i
feel
many
would
look
past
this
beauty
if
you
ahvent
had
yet
you
need
to
try
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
o
for
the
price
and
the
availability
this
has
got
to
be
the
best
stout
out
there
not
too
light
and
not
too
heavy
this
has
become
my
new

fantastic
stout
and
sold
yearround
im
quickly
becoming
a
bigger
fan
of
sierra

although
ive
always
been
a
local
supporter

to

and

woop
woop
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
again
overall
an
excellent
complex
stout
at
a
great

beer
sierra
nevadas
stout
is
a
classic
in
every
sense
of
the
word
from
the
bold
roasted
profile
to
the
smooth
chocolate
notes
this
beer
is
wonderfully
balanced
from
front
to
back
and
despite
its
intimidating
nature
is
quite
easy
to
drink
october
thru
march
this
lovely
loves
me
o
not
my
favorite
its
definitely
on
the
complex
side
with
some
hop
potency
and
bitterness
definitely
changes
as
temperature
warms
and
mellows
out
a
little
this
is
a
nice
stout
recommend
this
is
a
wellbalanced
great
tasting
stout
its
got
a
great
mix
of
chocolate
toffee
smoke
and
malt
flavors
the
malts
are
perfect
and
theres
a
slight
lingering
hint
of
hop
bitterness
great
body
slightly
chewy
a
little
dry
and
mild
on
carbonation
overall
a
solid
beer
tough
to
beat
overall
while
i
prefer
a
creamy
rich
ris
this
stout
easily
holds
its
own
with
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
bold
complex
flavors
for
a
5

abv
stout
great
flavor
nice
transition
and
very
sessionable
a
great
stout
if
you
want
to
throw
a
few
back
with
friends
i
recommend
this
one
an
easy
to
find
inexpensive
but
well
crafted
stout
overall
this
is
a
really
goodtasting
beer
and
the
fact
that
its
not
a
huge
hulking
stout
of
a
stout
is
actually
a
good
thing
because
this
is
a
yummy
stout
that
i
could
sit
and
have
several
of
its
not
as
flavorful
or
bitter
as
old
rasputin
not
as
big
and
sweet
as
sam
adams
imperial
stout
but
id
rather
have
three
or
four
of
these
than
even
two
of
those
at
a
sitting
to
compare
it
to
something
of
comparable
abv
its
better
than
guinness
a
good

for
its
abv
easy

and
a
good

beer
its
pretty
well
done
sierra
nevada
stout
finally
getting
around
to
reviewing
this
classic
its
appearance
is
archetypal
with
a
dark
shade
of
brown
not
unlike
oil
light
barely
passes
through
the
glass
and
over
top
is
a
12
inch
layer
of
puffy
tan
froth
the
aromas
coming
from
the
beer
are
great
as
well
milk
chocolate
sweet
bread
and
molasses
one
sip
and
the
drinker
will
be
in
love
the
velvety
smooth
liquid
coats
the
palate
nicely
and
tastes
milky
toasty
nutty
and
decadent
for
such
a
low
abv
beverage
the
brewers
best
achievement
here
is
the
balance
of
all
the
aforementioned
elements
though
it
finishes
with
a
slightly
bitter
end
which
leaves
one
to
only
want
more
buy
with
confidence
this
is
no
run
of
the
mill
stout
poured
into
an
elysian
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
black
in
the
glass
with
a
fine
light
brown
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
promising
aroma
of
dark
toasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
of
toasted
lightly
charred
malt
light
coffee
chocolate
and
hints
of
nuts
finishes
moderately
bitter
with
charred
coffee
notes
medium
bodied
with
hints
of
creaminess
a
well
balanced
light
stout
that
hits
all
the
flavor
notes
i
want
from
a
stout
perhaps
a
bit
thinner
on
flavor
than
i
expected
perhaps
because
ive
been
drinking
a
lot
of
imperial
stouts
a
well
made
traditional
stout
as
expected
from
sierra
nevada
overall
while
the
flavor
is
quite
nice
if
i
were
judging
purely
on
accuracy
of
style
i
would
have
to
deduct
a
few
points
in
even
this
area
the
lighter
sweeter
taste
reminds
me
of
a
porter
as
opposed
to
a
stout
still
the
overall
deliciousness
makes
up
for
what
the
drink
lacks
in
aroma
and
in
the
case
of
at
least
this
bottle
that
is
saying
a
lot
i
will
happily
continue
my
search
for
a
finesmelling
bottle
and
even
if
that
effort
turns
out
to
be
in
vain
i
will
continue
to
drink
this
beer
yes
indeed
i
will
overall
a
decent
stout
but
sort
of
down
on
my
list
of
stouts
i
normally
buy
widely
available
however
this
is
for
sure
a
great
beer
that
everyone
should
try
just
shared
a
taster
ontap
as
part
of
four
flights
at
the
brewery

then
ordered
a
half
pint
later
yum
as

o
good
not
great
o
very
good
stout
to
savor
after
a
long
day
i
quite
enjoyed
this
i
would
give
this
to
a
friend
as
an
introduction
stout
easy
to
drink
with
a
full
flavor
thanks
sierra
nevada
overall
this
is
a
nice
stout
if
not
for
the
off
finish
to
me
at
least
this
would
be
a
great
one
poured
this
american
stout
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
an
opaque
black
color
produced
a
thick
tan
color
great
retention
and
it
left
a
outstanding
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
and
earthy
hops
full
bodied
this
stout
has
a
foundation
of
roasted
barley
chocolate
and
caramel
bitter
hops
finishes
dry
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
sampled
to
date
a
nicely
done
stout
filled
with
dark
rich
flavors
throughout
complexity
check
balance
check
more
dry
than
sweet
but
should
readily
appeal
to
any
stout
lover
charred
malts
lead
the
way
in
a
rather
one
dimensional
taste
albeit
a
very
good
taste
very
malty
but
slightly
coffeed
the
char
reigns
throughout
there
is
a
certain
ease
and
smoothness
that
makes
this
stout
remarkable
o
highly
drinkable
sessionable
stout
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
might
give
this
one
another
shot
sometime
o
overall
a
nice
hoppy
stout
almost
too
much
so
style
wise
i
feel
this
is
more
akin
to
a
black
ipa
i
can
only
fault
it
for
its
name
it
is
delicous
o
this
is
an
amazing
stout
and
probably
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
so
far
i
love
the
hop
presence
in
this
beer
which
most
stouts
do
not
have
only
complaint
was
that
i
didnt
have
another
one
of
these
to
drink
after
i
finished
it
cheers
notes
like
sn
porter
this
is
a
hoppier
for
the
style
interpretation
which
is
powerful
complex
and
tasty
want
more
soon
overall
im
going
to
the
store
to
buy
up
the
rest
of
these
at
an
amazing
bargain
price
because
the
drink
by
date
is
in
two
weeks
its
that
good
i
am
very
impressed
this
stuff
is
the
real
deal
it
puts
guinness
draught
to
shame

for
a
6
pk
its
an
outstanding
american
stout
very
delicious
and
smooth
if
you
like
a
beer
on
the
dry
bitter
side
not
so
damn
sweet
then
you
may
very
well
enjoy
sns
i
would
play
some
west
coast
jazz
with
this
hampton
hawes
trio
music
would
be
a
good
choice
i
cant
say
why
it
just
comes
to
mind
o
i
liked
it
a
lot
its
a
real
easy
drinker
and
the
malts
arent
overdone
with
the
roasty
flavor
it
makes
for
a
great
session
stout
which
is
almost
an
oxymoron
sometimes
simplicity
looks
so
much
better
on
a
label
than
some
sad
excuse
for
a
pun
or
some
ridiculously
longwinded
and
adjectiveladen
description
sometimes
this
stuff
pours
a
dark
siennabrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
baking
cocoa
light
coffee
and
a
smattering
of
dark
greens
the
taste
focuses
on
the
roast
and
a
milder
version
of
the
greens
with
a
dash
of
coffee
in
there
for
the
sheer
fun
of
it
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
though
a
touch
on
the
thin
side
this
is
a
pretty
nice
stout
one
that
keeps
things
as
simple
as
the
label
presentation
osolid
not
amazing
medium
full
body
and
light
carbonation
reasonably
smooth
with
just
a
bit
of
hop
sharpness
to
cut
the
malt
and
prevent
it
from
being
cloying
an
extremely
good
brew
o
a
surprising
experience
a
rich
bold
and
well
balanced
beer
overall
a
great
stout
drinkable
and
not
too
over
the
top
overall
a
wellconstructed
stout
i
just
wish
the
incredible
nose
was
followed
by
similarly
incredibly
flavours
in
the
mouth
the
cost
of
au90
a
case
makes
other
equally
good
stouts
a
better
option
not
a
bad
stout
at
all
just
suffers
a
bit
when
it
comes
to
the
actual
flavours
not
bad
just
not
interesting
enough
to
cover
the
high
price
o
standard
sn
good
cheap
and
easy
to
find
its
worth
a
try
cheers
a
very
good
stout
and
one
that
i
would
happily
drinking
a
good
few
of
without
getting
bored
of
this
one
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
is
very
well
balanced
and
goes
down
wonderfully
0verall
this
brew
was
excellent
its
a
great
winter
brew
it
went
great
with
bbq
beer
crockpot
chicken
cheers
ogreat
interpretation
of
the
american
stout
style
a
bookish
stout
o
a
fine
tasty
and
unassuming
stout
very
drinkable
nothing
mindblowing
just
a
good
stout
this
beer
pours
up
a
deep
black
with
a
big
fluffy
two
finger
caramelcolored
head
decent
retention
and
outstanding
lacing
the
smell
is
molasses
toffee
and
malt
the
taste
follows
the
nose
very
sweet
on
the
front
end
with
a
molasses
like
sweetness
followed
by
a
dry
not
very
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasing
without
excessive
carbonation
as
with
just
about
all
other
offerings
from
sierra
nevada
this
one
is
very
solid
there
may
be
better
beers
in
every
category
but
as
a
whole
is
there
really
a
better
brewer
overall
great
beer
what
else
does
one
expect
of
this
brewery
overall
a
little
less
malty
than
i
wouldve
liked
but
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
fact
that
this
is
an
excellent
tasting
stout
and
that
it
is
absolutely
worth
checking
out
i
like
this
though
its
not
as
complex
as
the
other
stouts
ive
had
lately
after
a
few
sips
i
paired
it
with
paula
deens
not
yo
momas
banana
pudding
and
the
combination
was
excellent
a
solid
if
not
polite
stout
at
one
point
it
reminded
me
of
a
porter
a
good
gateway
to
the
style
tasty
and
would
buy
again
more
sn
craft
is
tasted
in
this
brew
true
to
style
light
on
its
feet
and
delivers
a
nice
roasted
coffee
and
cocoa
fix
good
on
a
balmy
socal
winter
night
note
live
review
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
flavoring
there
was
nice
and
robust
smokiness
to
add
to
the
already
rich
and
deep
chocolatey
malts
a
hop
bitterness
also
permeated
each
level
adding
complexity
balance
and
blend
the
feel
was
nicely
drying
leaving
a
pleasant
smack
and
froth
to
the
lip
if
anything
the
nose
was
comparably
light
but
the
rest
made
up
for
it
in
this
tasty
brew
either
way
if
you
want
a
standard
stout
that
has
more
hops
than
most
this
is
the
beer
for
you
however
id
prefer
to
just
get
something
from
laginitas
or
anchor
and
have
a
better
stout
style

medium

a

i
think
trying
a
classic
american
stout
is
a
must
o
a
great
stout
overall
i
look
forward
to
having
this
beer
again
o
definitely
the
best
american
stout
ive
ever
had
i
dont
think
it
gets
much
better
than
this
overall
an
incredibly
enjoyable
beer
sierra
nevada
makes
some
good
stuff
and
this
stout
is
on
the
money
so
fundamentally
sound
and
simple
just
executed
beautifully
a
pretty
awesome
stout
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
wasnt
the
best
stout
i
have
had
but
it
certainly
was
worth
drinking
i
have
enjoyed
pretty
much
everything
sierra
nevada
puts
out
some
day
i
will
have
to
make
the
two
hour
journey
north
to
visit
their
brewery
if
you
see
this
beer
in
your
local
store
give
it
a
try
i
think
you
will
be
surprised
like
i
was
cheers
overall
a
nicely
crafted
stout
pleasing
to
all
of
the
senses
smooth
and
balanced
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
or
few
overall
a
classic
stouts
that
is
a
benchmark
to
the
style
sierra
nevada
knows
how
to
brew
some
beer
worth
picking
up
at
least
once
o
overall
this
is
a
good
example
that
a
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
10
abv
to
be
good
a
simple
beer
that
hits
all
the
right
notes
can
be
pretty
damn
good
and
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
stout
overall
a
really
impressive
stout
tons
of
flavor
but
not
overly
heavy
and
sweet
and
almost
sessionable
something
i
should
really
pick
up
more
often
o
meh
decent
but
reminds
me
more
of
a
moderate
porter
with
some
zest
and
char
not
as
good
as
the
founder
breakfast
stout
or
porter
i
like
my
stouts
to
have
a
thicker
mouthfeel
and
a
bigger
and
richer
malt
bill
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
to
date
and
i
will
no
doubt
be
coming
back
to
revisit
it
when
poured
gently
this
full
bodied
stout
has
a
half
of
a
finger
tawny
head
resting
upon
a
pure
black
delicious
mass
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
very
enticing
malty
and
coffee
the
taste
of
this
beer
follows
the
nose
very
rich
and
satisfying
unlike
other
some
stouts
there
is
little
dark
chocolate
flavor
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
beer
is
lacking
in
flavor
because
it
is
not
at
all
the
mouth
is
nice
this
beer
goes
down
easily
oft
said
on
this
site
chewy
mouthfeel
that
hangs
around
for
a
beautiful
hoppy
stout
aftertaste
pours
pitch
black
with
a
brown
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
slight
lacing
smell
is
typical
stout
taste
is
pretty
good
i
get
the
chocolate
coffee
and
dark
malts
id
say
nothing
remarkable
but
still
a
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lasting
the
backend
dissipates
pretty
quickly
making
you
want
another
sip
the
taste
varies
as
the
beer
warms
its
not
an
oskar
blue
ten
fidy
but
i
will
buy
it
again
and
keep
it
in
my
refrigerator
a
fine
fine
beer
all
around
nice
to
be
able
to
try
this
again
overall
i
consider
this
to
be
a
top
notch
brew
that
i
intend
to
purchase
on
a
regulare
basis
in
the
future
if
it
had
a
little
more
on
the
nose
i
could
have
easily
scored
it
a
5
overall
go
pick
it
up
its
a
must
try
the
taste
was
surprising
different
than
what
i
expected
but
excellent
o
i
would
say
this
is
a
solid
american
stout
that
i
would
have
again
a
solidly
constructed
and
robust
stout
hits
everything
by
the
book
and
keeps
things
bitter
through
and
through
with
a
roast
maltforward
profile
very
much
worth
trying
out
at
least
once
in
a
lifetime
this
is
a
superb
stout
pours
a
blackish
color
oddly
bubbly
around
the
glass
longlasting
head
noticeable
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the

roasted
malts
are
on

and
the
taste
but
the
hop
bitterness
does
come
through
to
balance
the
flavor
in
the
usually
sierra
nevada
way
very
smooth
very
tasty
well
done
o
overall
this
was
a
delicious
stout
with
a
wonderful
flavor
im
convinced
that
sierra
nevada
may
be
the
best
of
the
best
when
it
comes
to
well
know
breweries
whom
of
which
produce
easy
to
find
beers
taste
starts
off
with
flash
of
sweetness
followed
by
a
little
bit
of
a
dryness
and
ending
with
a
mild
aftertaste
o
overall
a
good
stout
and
great
beer
o
stouts
dont
get
a
whole
lot
better
than
this
for
me
it
could
use
a
tiny
bit
less
bitterness
and
carbonation
but
really
im
just
splitting
hairs
here
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
1
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
some
coffee
bean
aromas
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
roasted
coffee
beans
and
cocoa
nibs
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
drink
a
nice
small
stout
i
only
got
one
but
this
seems
like
it
wouldnt
age
well
slightly
better
above
cellar
temp
as
more
and
more
flavor
profiles
developed
id
have
again
a
true
stout
and
highly
drinkable
as
well
o
a
perfect
stout
it
doesnt
get
much
better
then
this
for
plain
old
stouts
cant
believe
it
took
me
almost
250
beer
reviews
wot
get
here
the
more
i
try
i
of
sierra
nevada
the
more
i
am
impressed
this
beer
doesnt
break
the
trend
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
in
the
style
stout
one
of
the
best
here
boys
o
this
is
a
solid
allaround
stout
from
sierra
nevada
that
brings
a
tasty
flavor
and
would
be
very
easy
to
consume
in
numbers
if
youre
looking
for
a
stout
with
solid
amount
of
both
hops
and
roasty
character
look
no
further
as
this
offering
certainly
does
the
job
well
o
pretty
nice
stout
readily
available
helps
and
is
a
nice
stout
you
dont
have
to
hunt
down
to
enjoy
o
im
not
a
big
sierra
nevada
fan
but
i
got
this
one
in
a
make
your
own
6
pack
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
is
on
the
cusp
of
being
too
thin
and
too
bitter
but
it
never
quite
falls
over
the
cliff
i
would
pick
it
again
in
a
pick
a
6
type
situation
sierra
nevada
stout
is
short
on
flavor
but
quite
harsh
all
in
all
i
found
it
really
difficult
to
put
down
this
beer
might
have
been
considered
respectable
back
in
the
day
but
times
have
changed
o
powerful
i
love
this
beer
a
step
up
from
sierra
nevadas
porter
in
flavor
and
body
of
all
the
stouts
ive
ever
had
this
one
tastes
the
mostpure
hard
to
explain
but
it
satisfies
in
an
unexpected
way
its
refreshing
overall
a
little
disappointing
i
was
hoping
for
more
roasted
malt
but
the
hops
battle
it
out
for
supremacy
rather
than
taking
a
backseat
like
your
typical
stout
comes
across
as
a
brownporter
hybrid
moreso
than
a
stout
still
the
incredible
mouthfeel
makes
up
for
what
it
lacks
in
ideal
flavor
and
comes
out
somewhere
around
great
drinking
at
a
warmer
temp
allows
the
malt
character
to
blossom
too
cold
and
the
hops
dominate
o
pretty
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
though
not
exactly
a
sessionable
beer
i
like
the
dark
roasted
malt
flavors
and
smells
are
very
enjoyable
i
would
enjoy
getting
this
one
another
time
originally
reviewed
11032010
a
very
worthy
stout
up
there
with
guinness
and
murphys
i
personally
like
my
stouts
less
hoppy
and
smoother
but
still
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
an
enjoyable
fairly
classic
example
of
an
american
stout
pours
black
with
a
thumbs
width
mocha
head
and
decent
lacing
maybe
this
is
an
old
bottle
but
aroma
and
flavor
was
largely
lacking
some
roasted
barley
cocoa
and
maybe
a
touch
of
smoke
a
crisp
not
quite
medium
bodied
to
this
overall
an
alright
beer
enjoyable
enough
to
drink
but
nothing
that
has
me
needing
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
overall
sierra
nevada
pulls
it
off
again
a
great
standard
for
a
style
drinkable
and
then
some
id
love
to
see
a
coffeeinfused
version
if
youre
used
to
ris
or
stouts
in
general
this
one
will
probably
disappoint
on
its
own
merits
meh
its
alright
its
drinkable
nothing
imposing
but
still
comes
off
as
a
hybrid
of
stout
and
cheap
beer
and
if
thats
your
kind
of
beer
power
to
you
me
i
was
really
hoping
for
something
richer
or
at
the
very
least
having
a
sturdier
mouthfeel
not
recommended
do
this
is
a
lighter
stout
that
looks
and
feels
great
but
could
use
a
shot
of
assertiveness
when
it
comes
to
the
sensory
qualities
of
smell
and
to
a
lesser
extent
flavor
as
with
most
of
sierra
nevadas
darker
offerings
the
hops
are
more
attentiongetting
than
one
might
anticipate
on
the
other
hand
the
roasted
qualities
which
ought
to
be
defining
are
mellow
and
supportive
instead
while
deschutes
obsidian
stout
is
a
more
balanced
allpurpose
example
of
the
style
this
is
still
not
without
its
charms
overall
a
really
tasty
easydrinking
lowabv
stout
w
lots
going
on
perhaps
the
bestvalue
stout
ive
had
hard
to
rank
among
others
of
the
same
style
a
simple
american
stout
with
loads
of
flavor
a
bright
nose
some
intermediate
complexity
and
sessionability
at
the
strength
sierra
nevada
is
all
about
characterizing
their
beers
on
hops
even
the
malty
styles
im
glad
i
didnt
pass
this
one
up
4
0
from
the
ubiquitous
12
oz
bottle
another
wellmade
beer
from
people
who
know
what
theyre
doing
o
ive
had
the
porter
before
which
i
feel
is
just
ok
so
i
assumed
the
stout
would
be
the
same
i
was
sorely
mistaken
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
sn
beers
ive
ever
had
o
a
really
sessionable
beer
and
overall
appearance
is
amazing
taste
impeccable
seemingly
can
hardly
be
faulted
i
want
more
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
black
with
a
twofinger
length
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
there
are
strong
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malts
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
i
can
detect
some
faint
hop
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
barley
malt
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
it
tastes
like
it
smells
but
the
flavors
are
full
and
bold
there
is
some
bitterness
in
the
flavor
as
well
and
the
hops
provide
some
of
that
bitterness
as
well
as
extra
flavor
to
go
with
the
traditional
stout
flavors
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
some
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
the
beer
coats
the
mouth
very
well
overall
this
is
a
most
excellent
stout
and
one
id
recommend
pours
a
very
ominous
black
hardly
an
edge
of
clarity
healthy
finger
of
mocha
colored
head
that
dissipates
to
a
fine
ring
good
lacing
resinous
hops
cut
through
the
roasted
dark
malts
on
the
nose
an
uncanny
balance
like
a
black
ipa
the
taste
is
nice
and
smokey
like
a
breath
of
fresh
air
after
a
few
blunders
recently
in
the
stout
category
theres
all
the
appropriate
stout
characteristics
dialed
back
to
achieve
a
smooth
and
approachable
balance
not
sure
why
ive
overlooked
this
one
until
now
quite
good
all
4s
pours
black
in
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipated
and
leaves
good
lacing
on
the
glass
not
much
carbonation
aroma
is
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
tasted
of
roasted
chocolate
malts
and
coffee
with
some
bitterness
full
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
overall
not
a
bad
stout
if
you
like
them
bitter
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
sometime
but
we
really
dont
get
anything
aside
from
pale
ale
on
tap
in
nj
o
this
was
a
very
good
stout
definitely
worth
the
price
not
as
much
flavor
as
some
of
the
top
notch
stouts
that
ive
had
but
at
less
then
12
for
a
6pack
it
is
very
hard
to
beat
definitely
recommended
if
you
like
sweet
stouts
overall
a
good
affordable
session
drinking
stout
it
has
a
nice
taste
a
creamy
body
and
is
not
overpowering
making
it
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
a
great
offering
from
sierra
nevada
that
really
reminds
me
of
their
porter
naturally
perhaps
a
bit
more
fullbodied
and
bold
than
the
porter
a
great
brew
for
anyone
who
enjoys
roasty
malt
forward
beers
o
hopped
up
without
sacrificing
balance
pretty
damn
delicious
o
a
good
example
of
classic
stout
o
while
it
wont
blow
any
doors
off
in
terms
of
complexity
this
is
a
quality
versatile
stout
that
would
serve
as
a
very
nice
transitional
beer
for
newcomers
to
the
category
and
a
nice
pint
anytime
for
the
rest
of
us
like
a
number
of
their
beers
there
isnt
one
thing
that
stands
out
but
the
elements
all
come
together
so
well
you
can
taste
the
brewing
experience
in
it
this
has
become
my
goto
stout
to
keep
around
for
when
i
get
the
stout
jones
but
dont
want
to
break
into
my
stash
of
stuff
for
critical
reviewing
as
good
a
stout
as
you
can
buy
in
a
sixpack
as
far
as
im
concernced
pours
a
rich
thick
dark
chocolate
color
with
a
fluffly
lasting
mocha
head
smells
deeply
roasty
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
flavor
is
well
balanced
a
little
hoppy
bite
at
the
end
but
all
smoothed
out
by
the
dark
malts
i
dont
pick
up
much
coffee
or
chocolate
flavor
in
this
one
just
a
very
organic
feeling
beer
its
smooth
like
a
good
oatmeal
stout
and
has
a
bit
of
the
flaked
oat
flavor
in
there
feel
is
wonderful
carbonated
just
enough
with
a
drinkably
full
body
i
enjoyed
the
whole
6er
and
would
reach
for
another
if
there
were
any
more
in
the
fridge
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
all
around
went
really
with
a
big
mushroom
pasta
dish
as
well
yummmm
overall
this
is
a
very
wellbalanced
complex
and
flavorful
beer
thats
oh
so
easy
to
drink
nothing
really
makes
me
think
wow
but
it
does
everything
very
well
i
simply
prefer
more
robust
and
fullbodied
stouts
to
ones
that
are
the
more
drinkable
type
still
this
is
a
solid
and
very
enjoyable
offering
from
sierra
nevada
i
didnt
expect
anything
less
o
overall
was
a
good
stout
with
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
than
i
anticipated
maybe
slightly
on
the
hoppy
side
for
me
but
hey
its
sierra
nevada
this
is
a
quality
stout
doa
o
a
nicely
rounded
and
well
put
together
stout
perfect
for
six
packs
honestly
i
could
have
easily
finished
this
in
just
a
few
minutes
had
i
not
been
taking
the
time
to
review
it
nothing
special
or
memorable
but
no
real
flaws
either
id
gladly
drink
this
again
if
handed
to
me
delicious
with
some
subtle
sweet
hints
but
it
still
has
that
fullbodied
coffeeanddarkchocolate
taste
that
makes
the
stout
one
of
my
personal
favourites
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
must
try
im
surprised
i
cant
find
it
as
easily
as
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
or
ipa
because
if
i
could
i
know
i
would
pick
this
one
up
more
often
definitely
o
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
readily
available
and
a
remarkable
value
one
of
the
better
american
stouts
and
a
solid
brew
from
sierra
nevada
definitely
worth
a
try
and
comes
recommended
too
bad
it
is
the
only
regular
sn
beers
that
is
not
readily
available
in
our
area
overall
this
stout
is
sweet
with
big
notes
of
chocolate
and
some
dark
fruit
to
round
things
out
some
may
not
like
this
stout
because
of
it
but
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
as
is
and
will
gladly
return
to
it
in
the
future
first
time
ive
had
the
stout
sierra
nevada
has
never
disappointed
me
o
fantastic
stout
very
underated

probably
a

inflated
rating
after

ipas
all

not
a

of

very
mild
for
a
stout
but
not
exactly
my
favorite
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
o
warm
inviting
a
great
sipping
stout
what
a
nice
surprise
this
is
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
tried
sierra
nevada
keeps
ringing
the
bell
recommended
o
i
dont
know
that
i
liked
this
beer
as
much
as
others
on
this
site
but
it
was
fairly
drinkable
o
i
think
this
beer
is
well
executed
with
some
complexity
and
robust
flavors
its
just
not
my
preference
pours
out
a
beautiful
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
tan
frothy
head
smells
like
a
hop
field
and
some
dark
charred
malts
and
more
bold
citric
hops
ahh
what
a
lovely
smell
the
taste
is
like
a
choir
of
angels
beating
your
ass
with
vines
of
humulus
lupus
and
then
giving
you
a
scalp
message
in
a
swiss
chocolate
factory
this
beer
has
a
nice
big
grapefuit
twang
and
finished
off
with
rich
toasted
marshmallow
smores
if
you
wanted
to
dig
deeper
youd
discover
some
bright
coffee
flavors
and
complex
tobacco
leaf
despite
all
of
these
symphonic
flavors
and
aromas
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
the
only
other
stout
that
comapares
to
this
one
is
storm
king
and
pound
for
pound
id
rather
be
drinking
this
one
right
now
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
stouts
you
could
get
your
cold
dead
hands
on
overall
im
not
sure
what
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
beer
sierra
nevada
knows
how
to
make
a
complete
stout
this
will
be
one
of
my
go
to
stouts
when
im
looking
for
something
easy
drinking
under
6
abv
well
done
sierra
nevada
well
done
o
not
a
bad
stout
something
simple
and
easy
for
the
everyday
stout
drinker
i
wouldnt
put
this
on
any
search
out
list
but
i
would
keep
it
around
home
for
when
noncraft
beer
fans
come
by
and
want
something
darker
o
this
beer
looks
phenomenal
i
felt
the
nose
and
flavor
were
dominated
by
the
hops
i
prefer
the
dogfish
head
chicory
stout
but
this
is
still
a
really
good
stout
o
overall
a
prettydamn
good
beer
though
it
lacks
the
viscosity
and
pungency
of
other
beers
of
this
style
its
very
approachable
affordable
and
easy
to
drink
it
definitley
doesnt
lack
in
the
flavor
category
either
glad
i
picked
this
one
and
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
medium
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
the
lighter
body
could
cause
some
to
perceive
this
beer
to
be
watery
but
it
really
allows
the
flavors
to
come
out
without
ever
becoming
thick
or
sticky
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
prickly
but
does
not
seem
to
interfere
with
the
flavors
verdict
a
fine
stout
from
sierra
nevada
not
overly
complex
but
really
pleasant
and
approachable
nice
roasty
flavors
make
this
a
worthy
brew
overall
a
really
great
take
on
a
smaller
stout
great
blend
of
dark
malts
and
hops
one
of
the
better
bargains
out
there
man
i
wish
this
thing
tasted
like
it
smelled
a
little
too
balanced
for
me
between
the
hops
and
roasted
malt
flavor
which
i
think
ultimately
dilutes
the
potential
robustness
of
the
drink
definitely
worth
having
another
though
o
not
a
bad
stout
but
could
definitely
use
more
depth
sierra
nevada
stout
continuing
my
tour
of
the
stout
world
last
night
i
tried
a
sierra
nevada
stout
the
sierra
nevada
comes
with
the
standard
black
body
and
brown
head
the
head
was
ample
and
lasted
until
near
the
end
with
a
sheet
of
lacing
on
one
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
mild
compared
to
other
stouts
but
foretold
of
what
was
to
come
this
stout
has
a
bid
flavor
mostly
malt
and
molasses
there
is
a
bit
of
bitter
toward
the
end
but
not
overly
so
some
stouts
have
a
harsh
finish
and
that
is
not
the
case
for
the
sierra
nevada
i
do
not
think
i
could
drink
two
of
these
but
for
one
stout
this
is
a
robust
flavorful
and
manageable
choice
o
i
dont
quite
see
the
hype
here
while
its
decent
to
be
sure
i
like
my
stouts
a
little
less
hoppy
than
this
on
the
positive
side
its
suited
pretty
well
to
both
winter
and
summer
drinking
duty
if
you
dont
like
your
stouts
hoppy
look
elsewhere
otherwise
give
it
a
shot
o
this
is
a
very
good
stout
i
enjoyed
the
hop
presence
ive
been
drinking
a
lot
of
founders
breakfast
stout
lately
and
it
is
my
favorite
but
this
was
a
nice
change
up
i
would
highly
recommend
this
brew
o
this
was
an
excellent
excellent
beer
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
it
since
i
got
into
stouts
and
beer
a
few
months
ago
based
on
ba
reviews
a
lot
of
times
ive
been
disappointed
with
highly
rated
beers
but
not
this
time
a
good
stout
i
dont
mind
big
hops
in
a
stout
but
i
think
it
brought
down
the
overall
flavor
and
drinkability
here
enjoy
damn
thats
a
good
stout
its
creamy
as
hell
smooth
great
blend
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
coffee
flavors
the
alcohol
provides
a
nice
warmth
thats
all
i
can
really
say
its
simple
but
perfect
overall
pretty
great
overall
beer
ive
had
it
several
times
in
the
past
but
only
yesterday
did
i
sit
down
and
really
pay
attention
to
the
details
a
top
notch
representation
of
an
american
stout
o
not
a
big
fan
ive
really
liked
most
of
sierra
nevadas
stuff
but
i
have
to
say
this
didnt
hit
home
for
me
i
liked
innovated
brewing
but
i
felt
this
beer
was
too
hoppy
and
not
nearly
as
smooth
and
thick
as
it
should
be
cost
4
at
the
bar
8
99
a
sixpack
overall
a
solid
yearround
beer
from
sn
good
stout
overall
this
was
a
solid
brew
i
cant
say
that
id
pick
it
up
a
lot
however
thats
only
due
to
the
fact
that
imperial
stouts
are
more
my
thing
this
is
a
very
solid
regular
porter
and
it
gives
some
of
the
imperial
stouts
a
run
for
their
money
but
its
a
tad
light
to
really
knock
my
socks
off
definitely
a
nice
session
stout
though
o
an
amazing
stout
this
reminded
me
of
how
much
i
enjoy
this
style
picked
up
a
6er
for
6
99
tough
to
beat
that
medium
body
soft
carbonation
perhaps
a
slight
creaminess
though
no
real
apparent
alcohol
o
not
a
bad
stout
sierra
nevada
very
rarely
makes
a
bad
beer
and
this
one
holds
up
to
that
an
excellent
beer
that
id
highly
recommend
o
just
another
really
really
good
beer
from
the
sn
main
line
like
pale
ale
torpedo
kellerweis
and
porter
quality
stout
right
here
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
after
the
pour
its
tar
black
with
a
hint
of
brown
hue
in
the
light
the
head
starts
out
frothy
cream
colored
and
bubbly
the
head
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
on
top
with
more
bubbles
around
the
glass
nice
thick
sticky
lacing
this
stout
smells
good
dark
rich
bitter
chocolate
and
burnt
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
very
solid
bitter
chocolate
stands
out
with
burnt
malts
like
the
smell
with
a
dry
hopped
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
as
its
not
watery
nor
too
thick
overall
this
is
a
solid
stout
all
the
way
around
not
an
every
week
stout
for
me
because
i
have
other
favourites
but
this
represents
the
american
stout
category
well
and
ill
revisit
this
one
eventually
which
is
saying
a
lot
with
all
the
options
out
there
stout
pours
black
with
the
perfect
sized
tan
head
the
smell
is
rich
very
malty
a
bit
of
chocolate
can
be
detected
the
taste
has
a
great
malty
earty
backbone
with
a
strong
choclate
coffee
flavors
belnding
in
everything
blends
the
perfect
amount
and
leaves
a
very
bold
flavor
the
flavor
is
very
strong
and
leaves
a
nice
bitterness
on
the
palete
you
would
proabily
not
watn
to
swtich
to
other
beers
after
this
no
watery
taste
like
some
other
stouts
and
no
one
flavor
is
sharp
on
the
tounge
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
best
american
stouts
out
there
i
got
a
six
pack
of
this
due
to
having
almost
every
sierra
nevada
except
the
stout
from
the
first
smell
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
ever
had
it
had
a
mix
of
both
chocolate
and
hops
balanced
perfectly
with
a
dry
biscuity
finish
i
couldnt
stop
drinking
them
it
was
that
good
truly
one
of
sierra
nevadas
best
will
be
drinking
this
in
the
future
a
persistent
dark
tan
head
sits
atop
the
pitch
black
liquid
leaving
a
lot
of
lacing
behind
as
it
disappears
strong
scents
of
coffee
molasses
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruity
esters
make
for
a
pleasant
smell
roasty
malts
and
coffee
dominate
the
taste
but
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
bitterness
in
the
finish
creates
a
very
nice
balance
a
solid
stout
all
around
a
great
example
of
the
american
stout
style
in
my
opinion
overall
a
good
tasting
enjoyable
stout
o
one
of
the
best
stouts
around
o
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
i
have
had
in
a
while
it
is
really
well
balanced
and
subtle
in
both
taste
and
smell
while
still
being
fullflavored
and
easy
to
drink
overall
very
flavorful
and
satisfying
stout
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
dr
easy
to
drink
but
fairly
low
quality
a
poorly
executed
stout
with
no
clear
appreciation
for
the
style
above
average
abv
both
in
style
and
beer
and
lacking
in
quality
ill
never
have
this
again
except
maybe
on
draught
o
overall
a
really
great
classic
example
of
the
style
it
seems
like
a
lot
of
stouts
nowadays
have
some
type
of
gimmick
to
them
i
love
those
and
they
are
not
bad
at
all
but
it
is
nice
to
just
have
a
straight
up
example
of
the
style
im
really
glad
i
decided
to
go
with
this
stout
one
of
the
best
tasting
feeling
and
smelling
stouts
around
the
balance
of
the
robust
roasted
flavors
blend
beautifully
with
the
bitterness
it
really
makes
this
a
treat
for
a
cool
night
o
this
is
a
great
easydrinking
stout
especially
for
the
fall
season
and
with
the
weather
the
way
it
is
right
now
cold
and
rainy
doesnt
pack
too
much
of
a
punch
especially
for
a
solid
american
stout
so
its
not
too
hard
to
session
this
pour
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
light
does
get
through
with
a
nice
mocha
colored
head
with
decent
retention
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
smells
are
of
darker
malts
not
as
roasted
malt
smell
as
some
other
stouts
though
the
feel
is
medium
a
little
thin
compared
to
other
stouts
the
taste
is
pretty
good
though
and
the
highlight
plenty
of
dark
malts
a
little
chocolate
and
a
nice
hop
type
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
another
pretty
good
sn
product
i
remember
after
drinking
guiness
for
so
long
the
revelation
i
had
the
first
time
i
tried
one
of
these
while
i
prefer
a
ris
over
this
i
do
love
this
beer
as
a
nice
session
type
stout
o
really
enjoyed
the
hop
profile
and
it
took
the
beer
a
couple
minutes
to
warm
up
to
that
point
where
i
could
really
smell
and
taste
the
hops
really
good
enjoyable
beer
o
one
of
the
better
american
stouts
i
have
had
very
flavorful
for
a
nonimperial
stout
and
an
impressive
effort
o
good
stout
easy
to
drink
not
very
heavy
you
can
drink
a
few
and
not
be
full
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
a
very
good
dry
stout
well
ahead
of
jokes
especially
the
draught
from
guinness
brewery
o
likely
my
favorite
sn
offering
ill
try
again
and
if
still
impressed
could
become
a
regular
dinsanely
drinkable
and
a
slightly
different
spin
on
the
style
which
i
thoroughly
enjoy
pours
black
with
brown
highlights
and
a
mocha
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
smell
is
inviting
roasted
malt
dominates
with
chocolate
and
smoky
notes
the
taste
starts
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
would
suggest
the
smoky
notes
come
through
and
it
finishes
with
a
bitter
malt
flavor
the
aftertaste
has
the
chocolate
and
almost
coffee
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
with
bigger
carbonation
and
nice
flavors
the
bitter
finish
calms
as
you
drink
but
initially
takes
away
from
the
mouthfeel
but
the
flavors
are
still
delicious
to
make
this
beer
enjoyable
overall
a
well
done
stout
with
many
great
flavors
overall
a
delicious
stout
that
has
exceptional
feel
this
beer
delivers
with
lots
of
flavor
and
keeps
me
reaching
for
another
a
truly
great
beer
from
sierra
nevada
for
its
quality
style
and
general
availability
one
could
barely
ask
for
more
the
answer
to
all
that
ails
the
american
nay
global
perception
of
good
standard
beer
one
caveat
though
one
must
like
robust
stouts
o
great
beer
d
no
misssteps
here
sierra
nevadas
stout
is
a
half
point
from
being
perfect
in
every
category
overall
this
is
a
very
decent
stout
its
probably
not
my
favorite
but
it
is
certainly
going
to
become
a
goto
stout
because
of
its
tastiness
and
availability
good
dark
chocolate
brown
colored
body
with
a
smooth
creamy
texture
nice
bouquet
not
overly
sweet
doesnt
have
a
heavy
taste
but
has
a
bold
nutty
chocolaty
taste
nice
feel
no
bitter
after
taste
nice
creamy
two
finger
head
too
bad
it
doesnt
make
a
black
and
tan
overall
i
think
this
stout
is
better
than
most
of
the
off
the
shelf
stouts
that
we
consumers
have
to
choose
from
problem
is
this
isnt
off
the
shelf
for
most
of
the
country
well
your
problem
not
mine
a
go
to
if
you
can
o
a
phenomenal
representation
of
the
style
and
it
is
easy
to
see
why
this
brew
is
in
the
top
100
beers
of
fame
here
excellent
moreys
bottom
line
while
this
is
definitely
good
its
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
ive
really
grown
to
love
some
of
the
thicker
full
bodied
stouts
like
founders
imperial
ten
fidy
old
raspy
and
even
fritz
and
kens
overall
a
very
good
stout
i
am
more
familiar
with
sierra
nevadas
hoppier
offerings
but
this
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
would
buy
this
again
o
this
is
a
great
stout
creamy
full
of
flavor
very
drinkable
and
a
very
affordable
beer
that
is
a
quadruple
threat
for
me
good
job
sierra
nevada
the
roastiness
and
spice
is
what
i
will
most
remember
about
this
beer
lots
of
it
creamy
head
and
taste
drier
than
i
expected
yet
not
too
hoppy
which
makes
me
happy
the
color
is
the
dark
murky
chocolate
you
expect
from
a
good
stout
but
lacks
the
fall
effect
one
sees
in
guinness
for
example
overall
a
nice
drinkable
and
easy
on
the
palate
brew
enjoy
reviewed

overall
a
superb
standard
stout
almost
on
par
with
the
russian
imperials
well
as
everything
sn
it
is
a
very
well
made
and
drinkable
beer
maybe
not
as
robust
as
some
of
the
local
offerings
but
makes
a
good
comparison
and
can
easily
be
used
as
another
style
benchmark
chocolate
taste
caramel
comes
in
to
give
the
dark
sharp
cocoa
a
break
and
provides
sweetness
seems
complex
but
really
its
just
a
straight
up
stout
take
their
porter
and
put
more
choc
malt
and
hops
in
it
thats
what
it
seems
like
to
me
im
having
it
in
midsummer
gonna
have
it
again
later
in
the
year
not
the
best
but
good
and
damn
solid
m
this
full
bodied
stout
from
sierra
nevada
is
really
a
world
class
brew
i
found
it
to
be
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
very
tasty
and
fulfilling
in
all
test
areas
its
great
for
the
fall
and
winter
seasons
and
is
a
great
beer
experience
for
those
who
love
stouts
all
the
time
and
even
the
drinker
who
just
wants
a
change
top
tier
brew
from
a
top
tier
brewer
exceptional
overall
good
cheap
stout
that
i
could
drink
everyday
overall
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
example
of
an
american
stout
quite
enjoyable
overall
just
a
fantastic
stout
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
and
the
next
time
i
cross
the
border
into
the
usa
you
bet
your
ass
i
will
o
for
the
price
and
availability
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
fails
to
meet
some
of
my
expectations
for
a
stout
for
the
price
and
light
consistency
id
sooner
go
for
a
black
ale
like
1554
which
i
love
o
very
good
sessionable
stout
for
an
affordable
stout
this
is
hard
to
beat
o
so
as
i
figured
sierra
nevada
didnt
disappoint
a
great
stout
my
favorite
is
still
obsidian
but
this
is
right
up
there
a
very
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
sierrra
nevada
can
do
more
than
hops
o
sierra
nevada
stout
is
another
outstanding
offering
from
this
brewery
overall
rating
approaches
4
5
particularly
recommended
to
those
seeking
a
significant
but
not
intrusive
hop
component
in
their
stouts
do
whats
not
to
love
about
this
beer
i
could
and
gladly
would
drink
this
all
night
long
highly
drinkable

overall
very
enjoyable

overall
this
is
a
good
stout
complexity
of
flavor
and
balance
meet
with
good
mouthfeel
to
form
a
good
offering
from
sierra
nevada
the
beer
is
black
with
a
thick
soapy
light
brown
head
that
clung
to
the
glass
it
smells
of
roasted
dark
chocolate
and
molasses
it
tastes
of
bitter
coffee
and
unsweetened
dark
chocolate
with
a
slight
piney
bitterness
its
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
it
also
has
a
great
dry
bitter
finish
this
stout
can
hang
with
the
best
i
would
drink
this
over
most
others
of
the
style
o
great
beer
its
sweet
and
malty
with
a
nice
hop
presence
perfectly
balanced
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
and
i
love
that
it
is
a
year
round
brew
overallive
had
maybe
more
sierra
nevada
beers
then
any
other
craft
brewery
but
have
never
had
their
stout
this
beer
is
balanced
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
its
not
one
dimentional
and
wont
get
boring
i
could
drink
a
6
pack
by
the
pool
in
100
degree
heat
very
nice
what
cani
add
to
the
brothers
a
very
palitable
stout
truly
a
sessionable
brew
i
buy
this
at
every
oppertunity
i
love
the
mouth
feel
as
well
as
the
taste
the
only
bad
part
of
the
whole
thing
is
that
i
tend
to
drink
a
6er
at
a
time
prosit
ive
had
beer
as
a
hobby
for
only
a
year
but
i
have
had
a
decent
number
of
stouts
and
porters
from
around
the
world
and
i
feel
like
id
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
stout
with
the
tastiness
and
balance
this
brew
provides
ubersmooth
so
drinkable
sn
has
produced
yet
another
winner
here
an
affordable
everyday
stout
to
enjoy
yearround
a
nice
sessionable
easydrinking
stout
for
those
looking
for
a
break
from
ultraboozy
imperial
stouts
o
very
good
stout
i
buy
this
beer
every
winter
great
on
a
cold
night
simply
a
solid
stout
its
a
great
introduction
to
stouts
i
enjoy
it
and
like
to
suggest
it
to
people
who
have
never
tried
stouts
before
the
best
part
about
it
is
how
widely
available
it
is
its
nice
to
be
able
to
get
a
good
quality
beer
like
this
in
almost
any
grocery
store
probably
one
of
the
best
all
around
stouts
that
ive
ever
had
readily
available
at
any
major
grocery
store
i
would
highly
recommend
picking
this
up
and
trying
it
o
this
is
a
decent
stout
4
this
stout
pours
out
almost
solid
black
with
just
a
hint
of
light
that
shines
through
the
head
is
pretty
decent
with
a
light
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
good
roasted
malt
aroma
going
on
with
some
light
hops
in
the
back
end
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
pretty
good
also
its
well
roasted
and
has
just
a
touch
of
burnt
toast
flavors
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
leaves
a
dry
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
overall
its
a
good
stout
not
really
my
favorite
but
id
totally
drink
it
if
it
were
available
sierra
neveda
does
it
again
with
this
bad
boy
they
are
definitely
one
of
my
top
5
favorite
breweries
they
dont
know
how
to
make
a
bad
beer
its
not
as
explorative
or
adventurous
as
a
lot
of
other
stouts
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
more
traditional
this
should
do
the
trick
this
beer
is
excellently
balanced
and
manages
to
be
simultaneously
complex
and
simple
american
stouts
that
are
not
extreme
in
any
way
almost
seem
hard
to
find
these
days
for
the
record
this
works
well
in
a
batch
of
chili
this
beer
was
quite
a
surprise
from
the
nose
i
was
expecting
a
very
weak
stout
but
it
was
anything
but
and
has
lots
to
offer
real
interesting
beer
really
this
is
quite
a
very
good
beer
exceptionally
well
made
and
to
be
honest
one
i
havent
had
for
years
until
i
bought
a
six
pack
recently
after
noticing
it
on
the
classic
beer
list
here
on
ba
id
honestly
forgotten
how
good
and
satisfying
this
beer
could
be
what
i
particularly
like
about
it
is
that
as
far
as
the
experience
of
drinking
it
goes
it
sort
of
straddles
the
line
between
a
dry
stout
and
a
cream
stout
nice
roasty
dryness
up
front
with
some
clean
bitter
roasty
notes
but
without
the
coffee
or
chocolate
notes
you
often
can
get
with
a
stout
the
backend
is
very
creamy
while
the
tight
bitterness
still
echoes
in
the
background
dry
throughout
but
just
a
haunting
hint
of
sweetness
on
the
finish
wonderfully
satisfying
im
going
to
make
it
a
point
to
addd
this
back
into
the
rotation
o
i
was
overly
impressed
with
stout
everything
from
appearance
to
smell
to
taste
was
dead
on
remarkable
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
overall
great
quaffable
stout
for
the
price
it
cant
be
beat
overall
this
is
a
great
value
at
7
50
per
sixer
i
ll
drink
this
again
but
i
think
ill
wait
til
winter
an
absolutely
delicious
american
stout
so
much
flavor
so
easy
to
drink
and
low
enough
in
abv
to
enjoy
more
than
a
few
over
the
course
of
a
night
phenomenal
wow
really
have
to
give
it
up
for
this
one
a
beer
so
flavorful
that
drinks
so
easily
thats
a
winning
combo
in
my
book
this
is
a
really
great
beer
and
needs
to
be
tried
if
you
havent
already
pours
black
with
some
ruby
highlights
the
aroma
is
a
bit
muted
with
mostly
coffee
and
roasted
malts
coming
through
but
not
very
strongly
the
taste
however
is
very
nice
its
a
perfectly
balanced
stout
the
coffee
and
roasted
malts
are
nicely
bittered
by
some
nice
very
earthy
hops
a
very
dry
stout
the
finish
has
a
nice
touch
of
smoothness
along
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
a
ride
in
itself
going
from
prickly
carbonation
to
smoothness
to
a
dry
finish
the
drinkability
is
exceptional
overall
this
is
just
a
really
good
drinking
stout
available
for
great
prices
medium
to
full
in
body
the
roast
bitterness
in
the
back
just
isnt
there
im
worried
that
this
isnt
teh
stout
at
all
but
some
black
pale
ale
mildly
sweet
up
front
the
body
carries
this
mild
sweetness
throughout
and
then
it
ends
im
bored
moving
on
again
id
have
this
again
if
i
were
in
a
really
shitty
bar
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
im
sure
ill
have
it
again
at
some
point
in
the
future
pours
like
you
hope
a
stout
would
dark
with
a
half
inch
of
mocha
foam
the
head
dissipates
too
quickly
and
the
nose
is
malty
without
sweetness
and
contains
faint
hops
the
taste
has
lots
of
roasted
malts
and
finishes
dry
thanks
to
a
subtle
hoppiness
that
makes
this
easy
to
drink
the
mouth
feel
is
a
fuller
body
but
not
quite
the
creaminess
of
a
guinness
a
good
take
on
the
style
with
definite
character
from
sierra
nevada
overall
this
is
a
very
good
standard
american
stout
certainly
above
average
but
doesnt
stand
out
much
overall
this
is
a
great
stout
at
its
price
and
at
only
5
8
this
is
easily
a
repeat
brew
worth
a
go
but
you
knew
that
anyway
notes
for
a
bitter
stout
this
is
great
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
will
buy
again
next
time
i
want
to
have
a
stoutnight
o
good
brew
well
done
for
the
style
not
among
my
favorites
for
the
style
but
good
overall
for
8
a
sixpack
this
is
a
great
choice
and
is
easily
found
in
most
liquor
stores
and
supermarkets
near
me
highly
recommended
the
taste
is
solid
the
roastiness
comes
across
as
a
drying
element
but
is
fairly
clean
and
doesnt
harm
the
drinkability
it
finished
wi
a
bitter
chocolate
thats
fairly
pleasing
this
beer
is
just
solid
but
i
cant
help
but
think
its
unspectacular
id
take
a
sixer
of
this
for
4
50
any
day
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
make
sure
i
stock
it
t
this
isnt
one
of
those
in
your
face
stouts
but
its
well
done
lots
of
roasted
malts
upfront
to
the
point
they
almost
taste
burnt
and
then
some
bitter
hop
flavors
towards
the
finish
slight
hint
of
coffee
grounds
as
well
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
too
light
for
me
but
this
is
insanely
drinkable
a
medium
to
high
body
some
roast
from
beginning
until
the
end
and
there
is
the
bitter
explosion
for
a
long
final
nice
combination
great
drinkability
something
you
can
have
a
bunch
of
overall
this
is
more
or
less
the
perfect
example
of
the
style
all
i
could
ask
for
would
maybe
be
a
touch
more
roast
m
only
slightly
viscous
but
very
drinkable
because
of
that
drying
slightly
astringent
mouthfeel
from
the
black
maltroast
barley
addition
but
that
just
makes
me
want
to
take
another
sip
and
another
and
another
o
im
really
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
stout
it
doesnt
fit
what
i
expect
from
an
american
stout
i
certainly
like
it
though
the
earthy
and
bitter
hops
complement
nicely
its
incredibly
drinkable
and
it
works
much
better
with
food
than
most
other
stouts
maybe
ill
think
of
it
as
a
dark
chocolatey
american
brown
ale
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
full
for
how
fluidly
the
beer
poured
its
not
viscous
but
it
definitely
isnt
watery
either
carbonation
is
high
and
id
prefer
it
a
bit
lower
but
it
isnt
ridiculous
or
anything
drinkability
is
aided
by
the
smooth
and
easy
flowing
nature
of
the
beer
but
hurt
a
bit
by
the
buttery
aftertaste
i
like
the
taste
just
not
as
one
that
lingers
for
a
while
leaving
itself
as
a
souvenir
of
the
beer
it
doesnt
measure
up
to
the
coffee
and
chocolate
so
id
rather
have
those
to
keep
tasting
before
the
next
sip
this
is
a
really
good
stout
though
and
may
be
on
my
shortlist
of
sixers
to
buy
regularly
o
a
solid
stout
in
terms
of
chocolate
character
and
mouthfeel
it
bears
a
resemblence
to
a
number
of
your
better
milksweet
stouts
a
definite
recommend
o
solid
example
of
the
style
id
expect
nothing
less
from
sn
i
don
wish
theyd
get
rid
of
that
obtuse
bottling
code
though
o
a
very
good
stout
easy
to
drink
nice
unique
taste
as
always
from
sn
and
a
beer
i
would
always
go
back
for
taste
is
delicious
a
wellbalanced
mix
of
burnt
chocolate
malts
and
a
little
hops
at
the
finish
eminently
drinkable
and
sessionworthy
this
is
a
definitive
representation
of
a
welldone
stout
in
the
end
beer
doesnt
get
much
more
enjoyable
than
this
is
someone
were
to
ask
me
which
stout
they
should
try
first
i
would
recommend
this
one
without
hesitation
this
is
a
very
balanced
stout
and
dry
enough
to
be
sessionable
this
beer
is
a
headscratcher
for
me
sierra
nevada
is
world
class
and
i
love
a
lot
of
what
they
do
its
rated
higher
than
id
expect
from
tasting
it
but
more
importantly
it
tastes
worse
than
id
expect
from
who
made
it
theres
a
slim
possibility
ill
pick
up
another
bottle
sometime
to
rereview
on
the
strength
of
their
other
beers
but
as
is
i
was
very
unimpressed
rjt
overall
a
good
beer
and
for
8
a
six
pack
a
good
go
to
a
good
representation
of
an
american
stout
o
this
is
a
textbook
american
stout
what
a
beer
excellent
stuff
per
usual
from
sierra
nevada
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
more
carbonated
than
i
expected
with
a
mouth
coating
creaminess
its
not
a
super
heavy
stout
by
any
means
which
definitely
makes
it
drinkable
drinkability
not
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
but
for
you
bitter
hop
lovers
out
there
that
drink
the
occasional
stout
this
one
is
perfect
for
you
pours
a
black
hue
with
a
creamy
thick
tan
head
that
manages
to
last
throughout
the
drink
chocolate
syrupy
bittersweet
roasted
malts
and
vanilla
come
on
a
par
with
a
considerable
level
of
cascadelike
hop
fragrance
decent
level
of
balance
in
the
glass
a
refreshing
but
also
lubricating
mouthful
of
bitter
roast
malts
with
a
sound
touch
of
sourness
is
soon
overtaken
by
the
fragrant
hopmalt
swallow
leaving
an
aromatic
finish
hinting
at
cocoa
powder
toasted
walnutsalmonds
and
datecake
laced
with
raisins
complex
finish
with
nutty
and
rootherbal
undertones
lingering
with
a
good
level
of
sour
fruitiness
and
chewy
bitterness
highly
drinkable
beer
low
abv
and
medium
body
make
for
easy
drinking
tasty
a
dark
but
not
jet
black
like
some
other
stouts
of
note
head
was
quite
bubbly
actually
this
beer
was
quite
carbonated
for
a
stout
smelled
of
roast
nuts
and
maybe
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
taste
matched
the
smell
to
a
t
i
liked
this
allot
i
like
the
fact
that
they
didnt
care
to
think
of
a
name
so
they
named
it
stout
oh
well
lots
of
potential
to
add
a
great
name
to
this
so
it
gets
more
recognition
maybe
i
liked
it
will
be
getting
more
of
it
given
the
high
overall
review
ill
assume
that
i
got
a
bad
bottle
ill
have
to
try
again
at
a
later
date
d
very
drinkable
and
full
flavored
imo
sierra
nevada
has
a
stranglehold
on
well
priced
easily
accessible
highly
flavorful
brews
cheers
the
cpj
get
some
i
think
people
should
be
careful
reviewing
this
as
a
stout
and
not
an
imperial
stout
for
its
style
it
is
very
easy
drinking
mellow
smooth
and
creamy
its
nice
and
dark
black
the
head
is
a
bit
thin
and
fizzy
and
quickly
recedes
sea
foam
lacing
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
follows
with
the
chocolate
roasted
malts
a
hint
of
coffee
and
a
dash
of
earthy
notes
nicely
balanced
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
rounded
carbonation
slight
creaminess
and
a
lingering
of
roasted
taste
an
overall
nicely
balanced
easy
drinking
beer
d
far
and
away
the
worst
sierra
nevada
ive
encountered
decent
but
not
recommended
looking
at
other
reviews
i
wonder
if
i
just
tried
a
dud
bottle
ill
give
it
a
go
some
other
time
and
see
if
my
opinion
has
changed
i
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
the
roasted
flavor
is
upfront
it
is
a
fresh
tasting
roasted
barley
the
carbonation
is
upfront
only
on
the
tongue
it
leaves
behind
a
dry
roasted
flavor
on
the
tongue
d
i
could
sit
with
a
couple
of
these
very
easy
drinking
stout
with
interesting
flavors
and
aromas
im
verry
happy
about
this
one
i
love
stouts
i
love
sierra
nevada
it
is
drinkable
however
i
expect
a
lot
larger
and
more
prominent
palate
out
of
my
stouts
just
too
uncomplicated
overall
a
nice
serviceable
stout
no
complaints
strictly
to
style
probably
a
solid
a
beer
but
to
personal
tastes
i
just
cant
score
it
that
high
overall
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
damn
good
i
find
no
faults
with
this
beer
another
stellar
selection
from
sierra
nevada
with
the
reasonably
low
alcohol
you
can
easily
drink
nothing
but
this
all
night
long
d
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
bought
it
as
a
single
but
will
definitely
be
keeping
this
one
in
the
rotation
this
is
the
perfect
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
beer
drinkability
simply
drinkable
like
others
ive
tried
from
sierra
nevada
drinkability
easily
drinkable
nice
set
of
scents
and
flavors
with
nothing
overwhelming
to
the
palate
and
the
body
isnt
so
thick
that
its
like
chewing
used
motor
oil
or
anything
so
it
certainly
doesnt
sit
heavy
at
all
lastly
the
abv
is
under
6
so
its
more
than
manageable
picked
up
a
single
at
trader
joes
for
under
2
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
dark
brown
color
with
blood
red
highlights
great
head
forms
atop
the
body
smell
was
like
a
fresh
cup
of
coffee
flavor
was
very
potent
like
a
double
shot
of
espresso
very
luscious
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
also
the
one
negative
i
have
against
the
beer
is
the
bitterness
that
comes
from
the
roasted
malt
i
found
it
a
bit
harsh
on
the
palate
where
it
hurt
the
beers
overall
drinkability
a
nice
stout
though
and
priced
quite
well
at
your
local
tjs
prost
matt
drinkability
is
superior
mainly
due
to
its
lower
abv
the
flavor
is
such
that
i
kept
reaching
for
my
glass
and
to
my
surprise
i
finished
the
bottle
in
due
haste
glad
i
have
more
of
this
in
stock
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
and
the
taste
of
it
invites
me
to
keep
drinking
more
extremely
drinkable
solid
overall
d
fairly
drinkable
but
with
this
strong
a
flavor
and
this
much
dryness
it
lacks
a
bit
a
very
drinkable
stout
very
simple
but
complex
great
job
and
i
definitely
will
buy
it
again

again

bravo
sierra

drinkability
outstanding
i
have
a
new
favorite
stout
in
sierra
nevada
stout
super
smooth
without
being
too
thick
and
a
complex
taste
everything
is
superbly
balanced
in
this
brew
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
but
not
too
much
and
not
too
sweet
the
hops
and
roasted

balance
each

i
picked
up
a
sixer
figuring
this
would
be
a
quality
stout
and
i
was
impressed
this
will
be
in
my
yearround
rotation
from
now
on
has
a
nice
taste
and
a
light
mouthfeel
and
great
aftertaste
that
leaves
you
wanting
to
drink
more
this
is
a
great
beer
highly
recommend
d
very
nice
introduction
to
an
american
take
on
stout
definitely
would
work
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
beer
poured
into
a
pint
black
with
mahogany
highlights
if
you
can
find
them
thick
coffee
cream
head
with
decent
retention
and
good
lace
aroma
is
roastiness
and
chocolate
overlaid
with
clean
hop
brightness
taste
follows
a
nice
blend
of
roasted
and
hop
characters
medium
body
with
creamy
carbonation
d
overall
sierra
nevadas
stout
stands
as
a
well
crafted
example
of
its
style
roasty
sweet
smooth
but
at
the
same
time
not
overpowering
on
the
palate
i
could
easily
drink
multiples
without
batting
an
eyelash
definitely
a
recommended
beer
for
either
a
gateway
stout
or
just
an
all
around
well
rounded
and
affordable
staple
probably
partial
being
a
sierra
nevada
fan
ipa
d
very
drinkable
and
nice
and
toasty
on
a
cold
night
drinkability
simple
but
there
is
great
balance
and
the
flavors
flow
smoothly
together
yes
this
is
real
good
the
bitteracrid
bent
puts
you
at
full
attention
reminds
me
much
of
a
strong
dark
bitter
roast
coffee
very
american
in
its
stoutiness
very
sn
very
drinkable
the
feel
is
sharp
initially
from
the
carbonation
it
lingers
like
a
phantom
through
the
finish
it
is
dry
from
beginning
to
end
the
body
is
a
rung
above
medium
but
not
overly
syrupy
or
viscous
cant
believe
ive
been
passing
on
this
one
all
these
years
note
to
self
everything
sierra
nevada
does
is
world
class
outside
of
the
completely
nondescript
aroma
this
is
a
very
solid
stout
and
one
that
i
would
buy
again
d
i
dont
go
out
of
my
way
for
stouts
but
this
one
i
would
have
no
problem
buying
again
good
beer
d
one
and
done
for
me
there
are
too
many
other
brews
out
there
of
this
style
and
not
to
waste
more
time
on
this
one
drinkability
an
excellent
beer
but
the
flavors
and
alcohol
level
are
too
strong
for
me
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
dvery
drinkable
and
overall
a
very
good
brew
an
accessible
stout
for
all
people
i
drank
a
6
pack
of
these
without
even
realizing
it
almsot
too
drinkable
if
there
is
such
a
thing
really
nicely
balanced
truly
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
stout
will
buy
again
if
other
substitutes
arent
available
drinkability
even
with
the
bold
flavors
and
strong
body
i
could
sit
around
and
drink
this
stout
all
night
would
complement
a
grilled
sandwich
and
then
provide
the
perfect
topping
for
a
scoop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
the
mouthful
is
very
thick
but
not
the
thickest
ive
had
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
that
ive
had
to
date
and
its
extremely
deserving
of
a
spot
in
my
regular
stock
id
have
no
problem
drinking
these
one
after
another
on
a
nightly
basis
d
this
tastes
good
looks
amazing
but
nothing
really
sticks
out
its
a
good
stout
to
have
once
and
is
great
for
its
style
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
12oz

a
basically
black
color
with
a
big
frothy

a
dark
chocolate
character
to
it
along
with
roasted
malts
some
coffee
flavor
another
great
beer
by
sierra
nevada
mouthfeel
is
good
but
not
exceptional
i
find
the
carbonation
to
be
a
little
too
fizzy
and
that
co2
acidity
takes
away
from
the
flavors
of
the
brew
it
does
have
a
decent
chewiness
that
i
like
but
not
enough
to
save
it
from
the
slip
its
had
s
n
stout
starts
out
rocking
the
house
and
then
quickly
slips
into
mediocrity
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there

spot
on
for

from
sierra

impressive
ddevelops
a
creamy
tanginess
that
i
find
undesirable
alcohol
of
course
doesnt
come
in
to
play
which
is
nice
for
a
stout
but
still
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
i
hadnt
had
this
one
in
ages
but
it
remains
complex
and
full
in
flavor
lowerabv
by
american
standards
and
smooth
balanced
flavor
allow
for
a
stout
which
can
be
enjoyed
in
quantity
its
a
good
stout
that
id
be
proud
to
have
made
but
it
doesnt
knock
my
socks
off
in
competition
against
similarly
priced
sixers
of
this
style
its
not
my
first
choice
but
im
sure
ill
have
it
again
this
beer
pours
out
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
off
white
head
that
lingers
looking
like
a
layer
of
clouds
on
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
of
roast
barley
and
a
light
hoppiness
the
taste
is
sweet
on
the
front
of
the
taste
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
due
to
the
combination
of
the
roast
barley
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
creamy
very
tasty
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
definitely
a
session
beer
d
one
of
the
more
drinkable
stouts
that
isnt
too
heavy
or
to
filling
this
could
be
a
good
cool
weather
session
stout
drinkability
very
nice
subtle
amount
of
presumably
strong
flavors
mixed
with
hints
of
unexpected
pleasantries
may
make
it
a
staple
amongst
the
american
stout
style
pretty
good
stout
definitely
liked
this
better
than
their
porter
not
bad
by
any
means
but
as
far
as
sierra
nevada
is
concerned
ill
take
the
a
few
of
their
offerings
before
this
overall
this
beer
is
amazing
kind
of
a
curve
ball
for
me
since
the
hops
were
out
front
and
the
roasted
was
in
the
back
but
a
the
beer
is
smooth
and
tasty
great
body
as
well
as
a
finish
worthy
of
angels

it

i
give

c
there
is
a
chance
ill
buy
this
again
drinkablity
easy
to
drink
heavy
enough
to
feel
like
you
are

with

light
enough
to
have

light
tan
1
head
thick
medium
density
roasted

well
balanced
with
a
big
hoppy
biterrness

would
have
expected
that
for
sierra
sort
of
a
bright
aroma
for
a
stout
medium
thickness
to
mouthfeel
with
a
mild
to
moderate
carbonation
coffee
and
roasted

seem
to
be
the
biggest
player
in
flavor
again
well
accompanied
with
a
big

flavor
nice
dry
hop
finish
almost
has
a
slight
fruitness
to
finish
expected
and
enjoyed
the
bigger
hoppy
presence
in
the
beer
not
over
done
though
well
balanced
i
was
a
bit
afraid
this
stout
would
be
overwhelmed
by
the
judicious
use
of
hops
but
sierra
nevada
has
pulled
it
off
beautifully
this
is
a
wonderfully
balanced
brew
the
hop
presence
adds
a
lot
to
this
beer
and
takes
nothing
away
from
it
think
itll
be
making
a
regular
appearance
in
my
fridge
bought
in
2010
in
a
case
from
shangys
in
emmaus
pa
d
the
ridiculous
burnt
flavor
really
puts
me
off
and
causes
me
to
not
even
want
to
finish
this
i
am
surprised
by
this
one
coming
from
sierra
nevada
mouthfeel
is
thinnish
for
a
stout
but
not
too
thin
not
sticky
relatively
light
overall
but
pleasant
very
drinkable
stout
i
like
this
i
wish
i
hadnt
taken
so
long
to
finally
try
it
pours
an
opaque
black
body
with
1
inch
head
and
some
lacing
on
glass
head
dwindles
to
light
dusting
of
froth
on
the
body
smells
of
smokey
molasses
some
hoppy
notes
similar
to
sns
pale
ale
with
faint
whiff
of
alcolol
tastes
of
smokey
dark
chocolate
with
hints
of
coffee
i
really
like
how
sn
kept
their
hoppy
presence
in
this
beer
feels
smooth
but
with
nice
bubbly
carbonation
on
the
tongue
overall
an
excellent
stout
with
more
of
a
hoppy
kick
than
most
after
reading
about
this
brew
i
decided
to
try
it
out
i
love
stouts
and
just
bitter
fooddrinks
in
general
especially
dark
chocolate
this
is
right
up
my
alley
and
it
is
an
exceptional
stout
that
is
easy
to
find
i
love
this
stuff
sierra
nevada
stout
is
an
excellent
everyday
stout
its
uberdrinkable
well
balanced
and
pretty
affordable
between
this
and
obsidian
you
can
enjoy
great
stouts
all
winter
long
without
breaking
the
bank
drinkability
is
fairly
good
the
taste
balance
is
a
little
skewed
to
the
bitter
chocolate
side
with
malts
taking
a
backseat
but
thats
not
a
gamebreaker
could
easily
have
put
away
a
few
more
another
solid
brew
from
sierra
nevada
notes
i
used
to
live
off
of
this
beer
when
i
was
in
college
literally
i
would
drink
one
almost
every
day
for
lunch
with
a
reuben
sandwich
i
ate
the
same
exact
meal
for
about
four
months
straight
before
i
decided
to
switch
it
up
why
mess
with
a
good
thing
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
stout
it
packs
a
bit
of
a
hop
punch
but
that
should
be
expected
from
sierra
nevada
big
taste
for
a
low
price
in
that
regard
its
hard
to
beat
this
is
a
regular
in
my
fridge
d
with
a
reasonable
abv
and
flavor
that
is
full
and
delicious
while
being
far
from
overpowering
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
ultimately
it
could
be
much
better
with
a
slightly
higher
gravity
and
more
viscosity
ive
learnt
in
the
past
couple
of
weeks
that
this
bottle
is
a
grey
market
import
to
australia
worrying
as
this
could
be
i
think
the
folks
at
sn
neednt
be
overly
concerned
in
this
case
because
this
beer
im
drinking
is
damned
delicious
i
can
only
imagine
how
good
this
would
be
fresh
and
god
willing
ill
be
rereviewing
this
in
california
some
day
good
generic
tasting
stout
accompanied
by
a
bold
cocoasugar
flavor
this
beer
is
backed
by
strong
hop
character
and
pours
nice
with
a
thick
dark
head
i
personally
think
the
malt
character
is
perfect
but
could
see
another
tasters
dissatisfaction
with
the
roasted
malt
backbone
also
prefer
it
served
at
a
lower
temperature
approximately
44f
than
other
stout
beers
perhaps
because
of
the
lowmoderate
alcohol
content
md
medium
bodied
but
seemed
a
little
thin
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
glad
it
is
readily
available
overall
a
decent
enough
brew
just
not
quite
up
to
sns
usual
high
standards
an
ok
beer
worth
trying
but
not
special
this
one
is
a
very
good
plain
stout
something
that
could
be
a
staple
of
a
beer
fridge
alcohol
is
hidden
and
the
finish
is
so
smooth
i
like
this
one
a
lot
surprised
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
it
forget
the
pale
ale
give
me
a
sierra
nevada
stout
poured
the
medium
bodied
stout
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
head
tastes
of
dark
roast
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
the
malts
and
hops
give
a
slight
bitterness
possibly
the
dtrains
favorite
sierra
nevada
brew
poured
deep
black
in
color
with
thick
offwhite
head
that
reduced
to
a
thick
cap
lots
of
wet
lacings
on
the
glass
roasted
malt
aroma
with
a
hints
of
sweet
malt
and
coffee
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
smooth
velvety
feel
rich
roasted
malt
flavor
in
the
beginning
that
leads
to
a
burst
of
coffee
flavors
in
the
middle
and
mild
bitter
hop
finish
a
light
bitter
pine
aftertaste
that
slowly
fades
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
stout
sierra
nevada
nefer
disappoints
very
drinkable
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
wow
i
am
really
impressed
with
sierra
nevada
in
regards
to
this
beer
i
thought
they
were
a
one
horse
show
with
their
hops
but
this
beer
shows
that
they
can
do
malty
too
im
going
to
be
sure
and
pick
this
one
up
again
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
defiantly
not
the
best
stout
i
have
had
but
its
still
a
good
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
poured
into
my
snifter
glass
that
accented
the
head
slightly
a
beautiful
dark
beer
with
a
nice
2
finger
creamy
head
that
went
away
after
a
few
minutes
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
the
taste
follows
the
same
lines
with
sort
of
a
roasted
malt
flavor
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
good
drinkability
one
was
enough
another
one
sure
would
be
nice
overall
this
is
one
of
the
quintessential
american
stouts
it
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
that
i
drink
often
this
beer
as
most
of
sierra
nevadas
is
balanced
towards
being
dry
drinkability
pretty
good
american
stout
i
like
the
bit
of
warmth
it
provides
this
beer
is
well
above
average
it
would
be
nice
during
the
cold
winter
months
of
course
i
wouldnt
have
a
bit
of
trouble
trying
this
one
again
sierra
nevada
just
knows
how
to
brew
a
solid
product
drinkability
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
the
original
american
stout
while
better
have
been
made
in
the
subsequent
years
this
is
still
damn
good
great
roasted
flavor
and
very
drinkable
d
i
would
say
that
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
good
it
goes
down
smooth
and
after
each
sip
i
find
myself
wanting
to
take
another
this
stout
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
me
but
i
still
very
much
enjoyed
it
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
cheers

this
stout
looks
like
itll
have
a
permanent
home
in
my
fridge
another
great
offering
from
sierra

wish
it
were
an
imperial
but
as
the
song
goes
you
cant
always
get
what
you
want
a
sure
winner
here
definitely
a

i
could
drink
this
anytime

the
year

day

of
checking
out

low
side
a
touch
watery
but
nothing
egregious
pretty
drinkable
i
would
welcome
another
overall
another
tasty
beer
from
sierra
nevada
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
but
it
seems
somewhat
limited
in
availability
around
here
overall
it
makes
for
a
great
session
stout
thats
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
nearly
opaque
mahogany
with
a
tan
head
that
stays
around
forever
wonderful
toasty
smoky
aroma
with
earthy
hop
undertones
a
very
hoppy
stout
the
leafy
green
bitterness
hits
early
but
the
midsection
of
this
beer
is
very
roasty
never
sticky
or
sweet
the
malt
has
a
great
roasted
fireside
flavor
while
keeping
the
mouthfeel
lean
and
drinkable
the
finish
is
dominated
by
hops
long
bitter
and
clean
one
of
the
all
time
greats
a
stout
that
sets
the
bar
for
flavor
drinkability
and
price
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
would
definitely
recommend
it
theres
not
much
i
can
say
about
this
beer
other
than
its
average
nothing
really
stood
out
for
me
while
drinking
it
it
poured
a
nice
color
and
had
a
nice
foamy
head
the
retention
was
also
very
high
when
i
swirled
it
around
in
my
glass
to
bring
out
more
flavor
but
the
thing
is
to
me
there
is
not
a
lot
of
flavor
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
beer
but
it
fell
a
little
short
it
wasnt
that
complex
i
also
did
taste
some
hops
which
is
not
common
for
stouts
so
that
kind
of
turned
me
off
a
little
stouts
are
my
favorite
kind
of
beer
and
i
would
recommend
this
one
for
a
beginner
just
getting
into
stouts
since
most
stouts
can
be
overpowering
with
their
taste
and
character
but
not
for
a
regular
stout
drinker
like
myself
pours
near
black
with
a
good
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
some
really
nice
chocolate
notes
with
a
bit
of
roast
and
slight
coffee
the
taste
is
really
nice
and
great
for
an
american
stout
not
of
the
imperial
variety
great
chocolate
coffee
and
roast
great
feel
with
a
very
nice
body
and
carbonation
levels
drinks
quite
well
i
wish
i
had
a
nonstop
supply
of
this
throughout
the
colder
months
very
high
drinkability
this
is
an
outstanding
american
stout
go
by
a
six
pack
if
you
are
a
fan
of
stouts
and
especially
american
stouts
as
this
is
the
top
of
the
class
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
that
ive
had
highly
reccomended
beautiful
dark
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
edge
nice
big
beautiful
creamy
head
i
love
the
look
of
this
beer
the
aroma
was
fairly
weak
to
me
faint
dark
chocolate
and
some
coffee
beans
no
booziness
or
funk
so
thats
good
the
flavor
is
a
very
nice
blend
of
dark
and
amber
flavors
dark
chocolate
comes
through
very
strong
not
picking
up
much
of
that
coffee
from
the
smell
but
theres
a
fair
amount
of
caramel
malt
and
toastiness
giving
a
nice
and
fairly
unique
sweet
stout
taste
nice
and
thick
it
goes
down
nicely
a
great
stout
for
the
price
i
recommend
it
highly
d
as
sessionable
as
a
stout
gets
nice
tasty
not
over
filling
and
drinks
down
quick
and
easy
tastes
full
like
a
savory
meal
a
bready
fullness
then
the
bitter
hops
pop
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
followed
by
caramel
sweetness
towards
the
front
the
sweetness
doesnt
come
through
it
mainly
tames
the
bitterness
for
a
delightful
mouthfeel
and
excellent
taste
ends
with
a
nice
chocolate
coating
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
very
nice
d
perfection
in
this
category
an
abv
that
makes
it
almost
sessionable
smooth
enough
to
enjoy
all
day
but
with
enough
robust
flavors
and
body
to
remind
you
that
youre
drinking
a
real
beer
fantastic
brew
this
is
stout
easily
the
best
stout
beer
ive
had
and
easily
ranks
among
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
an
offering
that
im
proud
to
call
american
t
still
very
hoppy
some
roast
anf
vinous
dark
fruits
come
to
try
to
help
but
nothing
can
be
done
to
over
throw
the
hops
just
carbonated
enough
in
the
mouth
just
enough
body
damn
well
made
stout
most
stouts
are
either
imperial
sippers
or
they
lack
the
sipper
qualities
needed
to
enjoy
and
savor
a
stout
unless
you
find
stouts
refreshing
summer
beers
well
this
is
just
ideal
d
really
great
a
great
underrated
sierra
nevada
brew
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
thought
it
would
be
priced
higher
than
the
pale
ale
but
no
a
value
at
that
notes
a
really
enjoyable
stout
pretty
typical
stout
flavors
that
are
executed
very
well
and
balanced
well
the
body
is
very
good
as
well
with
great
creaminess
a
very
well
executed
stout
not
a
world
class
one
but
a
very
good
one
excellent
value
for
the
price
definitely
recommend
it
d
decent
not
what
i
expected
from
thesame
company
that
brought
the
best
damn
american
porter
still
it
is
a
sessionable
beer
in
the
dead
of
winter
perhaps
food
pairing
would
benefit
this
beer
been
awhile
since
i
had
this
one
but
its
as
good
as
i
remembered
poured
into
new
dfh
glass
black
with
a
frothy
tan
head
some
lasted
the
whole
way
through
rich
roasted
maltchocolate
aroma
tasted
as
it
smelled
but
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
this
is
a
creamy
and
fullbodied
example
of
this
traditional
style
ale
very
dark
and
very
rich
fairly
easy
drinking
stout
i
guess
ive
spoiled
myself
on
too
many
imperial
stouts
and
excellent
porters
and
perhaps
am
expecting
more
of
this
stout
than
i
should
nonetheless
id
definitely
have
this
again
and
it
was
easily
my
best
beer
of
the
night
gorgeous
2
finger
tan
head
that
lingers
great
carbination
with
less
than
average
body
strong
aroma
of
sweet
carmel
and
chocolate
strong
roasted
malt
taste
very
drinkable
as
long
as
your
not
full
one
of
my
goto
beers
if
i
dont
see
anything
else
exciting
drinkability
definitely
a
great
stout
the
hops
at
the
end
provide
a
refreshing
feel
while
still
giving
you
the
wholesome
characteristics
of
a
good
malty
brew
this
is
one
of
the
stars
of
the
stout
style
definitely
preferred
over
guiness
extra
stout
will
be
purchasing
this
more
often
in
the
future
light
and
drinkable
for
a
stout
due
in
part
to
the
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
i
found
this
brew
to
be
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
though
the
balance
of
roasty
malts
and
a
slight
hop
kick
on
the
finish
helped
to
balance
things
out
the
feel
of
this
one
is
superb
it
really
took
me
aback
and
would
be
worth
trying
for
that
alone
as
it
is
it
happens
to
taste
damn
great
as
well
if
only
it
were
a
tad
cheaper
over
these
parts
it
would
be
a
colder
weather
staple
its
inviting
and
simple
and
probably
makes
a
great
gateway
drug
to
the
stout
world
it
surely
beats
the
pants
off
guinness
by
any
measure
overall
this
is
a
solid
stout
with
character
flavor
and
social
interaction
this
is
my
first
sierra
nevada
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
others
from
this
company
i
give
it
8
pints
out
of
10
dthis
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
when
my
favorite
obsidian
stout
is
available
in
six
packs
for
8
99
often
as
low
as
5
99
on
sale
there
really
is
no
place
in
my
fridge
for
this
beer
drinkability
smooth
drinking
good
complexity
rich
flavor
as
far
as
stouts
go
i
think
this
is
pretty
good
on
a
technical
level
thick
malty
and
straight
forward
i
cant
fault
it
for
anything
goes
down
average
for
me
i
went
into
this
thinking
that
i
would
love
this
beer
i
kept
passing
up
buying
it
for
years
for
some
strange
reason
the
odd
combination
of
flavors
just
does
not
work
for
me
and
the
aftertaste
is
even
worse
i
guess
not
every
beer
is
meant
for
everyone
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
to
see
if
this
experience
is
just
an
aberration
cheers
seems
to
me
that
this
could
be
a
session
stout
but
its
still
a
sipping
beer
not
because
of
its
body
thickness
and
alcohol
content
but
because
of
its
flavor
another
great
offereing
from
sierra
nevada
if
you
ask
me
d
a
few
places
around
here
stock
sixers
at
a
reasonable
price
so
the
only
way
to
get
this
on
the
cheap
is
in
a
case
where
is
the
variety
case
for
such
a
common
brew
this
one
should
be
included
btw
d
easy
of
drink
and
very
enjoyable
could
be
bigger
and
bolder
but
still
a
very
nice
stout
to
have
around
too
much
hops
not
enough
complexity
somewhat
disappointing
after
their
lovely
porter
drinkabilityquite
drinkable
with
a
rather
long
finish
md
nice
thick
mouthfeel
but
the
carbonation
makes
it
go
down
smooth
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
6er
or
more
of
this
brew
4
drinkability
this
is
a
great
solid
stout
with
big
american
hops
a
perfect
stout
for
the
summer
months
when
you
need
to
change
things
up
roasty
and
hoppy
for
the
style
and
price
its
an
excellent
offering
anytime
i
want
a
stout
less
than
imperial
this
would
be
a
fine
offering
d
i
have
felt
let
down
by
other
sn
beers
i
have
had
in
the
past
but
this
beer
really
rekindled
my
optimism
in
sierra
nevada
what
a
lovely
complex
stout
a
great
session
beer
to
have
at
hand
will
definitely
be
getting
more
of
this
a
superb
beer
and
actually
a
little
underrated
in
my
opinion
though
i
havent
had
many
of
the
style
i
now
see
this
as
the
definite
american
stout
if
the
hops
are
somewhat
subdued
with
age
i
think
this
is
probably
a
positive
because
the
beer
i
just
drank
was
beautifully
balanced
definitely
one
alltime
favorite
standbys
nice
rich
coffee
color
with
offwhite
head
the
aroma
presents
nice
roasted
qualities
balanced
by
hints
of
caramel
and
a
kiss
of
earthy
hops
flavors
are
equally
balanced
great
roasted
malt
that
never
over
extends
its
welcome
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
especially
as
the
it
lingers
on
the
palate
and
a
nice
earthy
pine
quality
that
builds
in
the
background
from
the
hops
a
very
easy
drinking
stout
that
is
spot
on
for
style
and
addictive
highly
recommended
served
on
2jul2010
d
a
very
good
beer
overall
probably
the
best
porter
ive
tried
quite
drinkable
with
a
nottooheavy
feel
which
could
happen
with
the
strong
taste
d
some
say
sessionable
some
say
quaffable
i
say
poundable
like
jennifer
love
hewitt
if
that
is
too
brash
then
ill
just
say
it
is
good
and
i
can
drink
it
all
day
pours
a
light
black
with
a
light
brown
impressive
head
faint
roasted
aroma
bittersweet
chocolate
and
roasted
notes

the
flavor
profile
hops
come
through
to
balance
out
the
stout
a
hint
of
citrus
hops
lead
to
a
semibitter
taste
but
well
rounded
medium
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
of
creaminess

is
very
dark

with
a
nice
light

smell
is
lightly
roasted
but
not
burnt
very
strong
chocolate
smell
very
sweet
scent
no
hop
smell
which
is
surprising
for
a
sierra
nevada
ale
taste
is
delicious
very
strong
chocolatey
taste
with
light
hops
nice
coffee
backbone
mouthfeel
is
very
delightful
not
watery
at
all
even
for
someone
who
has
drank
a
lot
of
imperial
stouts
lately
i
would
say
this
beer
lies
between
your
average
watereddown
stout
and
an
imperial
stout
amazing
drinkability
wish
i
had
a
whole
sixer
of
this
sierra
nevada
fails
to
disappoint
once
again
o
yum
a
buy
again

from

that
continues
to
impress
me
with
quality
beers
despite
their
growing
size
d
an
outstanding
stout
another
great
sierra
nevada
beer
i
can
think
of
fewer
better
stouts
in
the
sixpack
highly
circulated
varieties
d
an
awesome
example
of
an
american
stout
very
tasty
easy
to
drink
and
excellent
stout
to
have
around
at
all
times
again
completely
disappointed
i
love
their
porter
but
his
was
completely
over
hopped
for
the
style
the
reason
people
drink
stouts
and
porters
are
for
the
maltiness
of
them
not
the
hops
if
i
wanted
and
ipa
i
would
have
drank
one
d
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
beer
can
knock
back
45
in
a
sitting
and
be
able
to
function
well
a
lot
of
flavor
and
well
balanced
still
i
think
it
is
the
cone
hops
that
make
this
stand
out
with
the
earthiness
and
touches
of
pine
and
citrus
that
mellow
out
the
coffee
malts
and
chocolate
in
this
d
slightly
drinkable
i
could
have
23
of
these
with
no
problem
the
light
body
and
relatively
low
abv
makes
this
drinkable
yet
without
sacrificing
flavor
d
the
crisp
feel
of
this
beer
makes
it
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
stouts
ive
had
i
could
easily
quaff
23
pints
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
i
loved
the
earthy
hop
character
of
this
stout
id
definitely
buy
this
one
again
cheers
overall
a
very
nice
stout
something
you
can
drink
year
round
d
very
good
but
not
my
favorite
from
sn
a
decent
stout
but
lacking
something
for
me
the
flavour
balance
isnt
quite
there
d
if
i
could
find
this
regularly
i
would
drink
it
every
day
enjoy

liqour

cold
when
bought
has
been
out
of

for
several

and

upon

smells
from
the
bottle
are
dark

and
a
faint
hint
of
hops
pours
dark
black
with
no
chance
of
light
coming
through
and
a
three
finger
head
that
recedes

slowly
taste
is
very
smooth
and
light
for
its
darkness
with
a
bitter
chocolate
note
in

mouthfeel
is
ok
and
does
not
seem
to
stick
to
the
palate
overall
a
pretty
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
stout
taste
is
strong
chocolatecoffee
roasted
malt
and
a
subtle
hoppiness
to
it
excellent
balance
i
may
have
had
a
better
stout
but
this
one
is
impressive
in
its
diversity
and
balance
medium
full
body
smooth
a
just
a
subtle
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
exit
overall
this
a
very
attainable
stout
and
worth
a
shot
for
any
occasion
notes
yes
indeed
this
feels
like
a
notched
up
version
of
the
porter
and
in
that
context
slightly
better
md
not
too
bubbly
and
pretty
smooth
d
very
good
not
the
best
stout
but
good
id
buy
a
sixer
and
probably
order
a
second
sierra
nevada
strikes
again
with
a
solid
beer
that
is
more
or
less
true
to
style
d
very
nice
thick
and
complex
flavor
and
refreshing
enough
to
keep
going
back
for
more
i
generally
prefer
my
stouts
with
a
greater
emphasis
on
the
roasted
malt
flavor
but
this
is
still
great
d
it
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
d
could
drink
this
literally
all
day
my
new
favorite
stout
drinkability
great
stout
up
there
in
the
favorites
category
this
particular
stout
is
acceptable
but
its
not
that
good
im
a
little
amazed
to
see
so
many
a
reviews
its
tolerable
and
ill
drink
the
entire
sixpack
i
bought
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
in
my
opinion
they
went
a
little
overboard
with
the
hops
this
has
been
the
case
with
every
sierra
nevada
brew
ive
tried
irrespective
of
style
i
dont
think
of
stouts
as
being
this
hoppy
so
it
was

dont

this
its
not
necessarily
my
favorite
interpretation
of
style
since
sierra

has
traditionally
meant
pale
ale
to
me
very
well
crafted
and
a
pleasant
surprise
to
boot
very
drinkable
thanks
to
the
sweetness
being
a

than

on

how

i

ive
tried
many
that
do
improve

warm

i
dont
know
if
ive
ever
had
one
that
really
changed

improved
so
much
as
it
warms
the
chocolate
taste
especially
becomes

smelled

tasted

its

it
was
transparent
in

just
not

tastes
like

cake
may
be
a

overwhelming
though
overall
it
really
gets
the
chocolate
check
in

box
but
there
is
no

to
set
as
a
canvas
its
just
a
watered
down
chocolate
drink
it
really
is
unfortunate
because
the
chocolate
stands
out
and
would
probably
work
great
on
a
beer
that
has
some
flavor
and
body
i
wouldnt

it

unscrewed
the

i
really
have
to
give
a
tip
o

to
the
reviewer
who
said

with

icing
spot
on
i
was
braced
for
it
to
be
sickeningly
sweet
but
it
was
very
pleasant
i
did
not
have
a
cake
since
i
am
not
big
on
sweets
but
this
stood
in
nicely
in
lieu
of
one
the
finish
was
semisweet
and
the
chocolate
was
not
front
and
center
as
i
imagined
but
there
was
a
cakelike
flavor
leading
the
way
instead
happy

to
us
all

not

surprisingly
this
is

the

to
me
taste

this
is
due
in

to
the

of
the

give
this

a

than
i

over

this
is

option
that
is
not

of
their

overall
if
you
want
a

that
tastes
pretty

exactly

look
no

iglesias
about
it
thats
how
similar
it
is
to
chocolate
cake
i
havent
tried
any
other
beer
from
shiner
yet
their
bock
is
the
only
one
i
ever
see
around
here
though
i
did
spot
a
few
others
in
the
roanoke
area
alongside
this
one
but
if
the
special
beer
for
their
107th
birthday
is
on
the
same
level
of
yumminess
as
the
106th
ill
be
sure
to
check
that
out
when
it
comes
around
heck
i
may
just
have
to
get
some
more
of
their
106th
birthday
beer
for
my
29th
thats
coming
up
in
a
few
monthsitd
be
a
shame
to
only
have
this
once
in
my
entire
life
pours
black
with
a
thin
head
smells
like
fudge
brownies
the
smell
is
incredible
and
is
really
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
a
stale
tootsie
roll
not
much
complexity
here
very
thin
mouthfeel
overall
its
just
not
a
very
good
stout
the
smell
from
the
bottle
was
very
nice
though
yummy
ive
never
tasted
a
beer
that
taste
exactly
what
its
going
for
like
this
beer
holy
shit
its
chocolate
cake
but
at
the
same
time
its
gross
because
im
drinking
beer
that
taste
like
chocolate
cake
awesomely
interesting
the
great
chocolate
aroma
but
downplayed
chocolate
sweet
flavor
make
this
quite
drinkable
tried
this
beer
today
after
finding
it
at
the
store
wow
i
want
more
of
this
stuff
it
was
as
if
i
just
drank
a
piece
of
chocolate
cake
this
is
a
very
limited
beer
so
if
you
want
to
try
and
can
still
find
it
buy
it
its
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
this
style
of
beer
i
bought
the
last
one
so
im
on
the
hunt
for
at
least
one
more
of
these
before
they
are
gone
for
good
very
light
taste
great
smell
overall
im
going
to
stop
writing
so
i
can
enjoy
this
beer
fabulous
session
stout
with
no
off
flavors
and
a
milky
silky
feel
o
not
bad
glad
i
got
a
free
can
nice
dark
color
good
head
that
sticks
around
the
taste
reminds
me
of
footsie
rolls
overall
a
really
nice
beer
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
this
is
the
first
shiner
beer
ive
tried
everything
about
it
screams
old
scool
and
it
is
enjoyable
the
aroma
is
straight
up
a
mixture
of
chocolate
cake
and
tootsie
rolls
the
taste
is
thinner
than
expected
and
very
sweet
overall
would
try
again
on
a
hot
winter
day
a
nice
dark
beer
with
the
rich
chocolate
finish
this
beer
goes
from
being
enjoyable
to
inoffensive
at
best
as
you
drink
it
nice
creamy
chocolate
notes
give
way
to
a
taste
not
to
dissimilar
to
soy
sauce
started
out
liking
this
one
ended
up
disliking
it
please
bring
back
the
ability
to
just
give
a
number
for
a
rating
this
outlierreview
stuff
just
sucks
as
does
this
horrible
beer
watery
fake
chocolate
flavor
is
nothing
close
to
what
i
consider
a
stout
probably
my
last
shiner
beer
i
bought
a
12
pack
with
high
hopes
i
keep
trying
them
and
drain
pouring
aroma
is
spot
on
initial
taste
is
spot
on
so
i
guess
by
those
standards
the
brewers
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
however
i
have
a
hard
time
stomaching
more
than
half
a
bottle
as
offerings
from
shiner
go
id
rank
it
at
the
bottom
any
ratings
over
a
3
i
find
hard
to
believe
i
was
thouroughly
disappointed
because
im
a
stout
lover
and
a
shiner
supporter
id
rather
drink
a
tequiza
than
this
though
wooooooooooooio
so
so
so
wo
this
was
terrible
as
someone
who
loves
dark
beer
this
was
almost
undrinkable
it
tasted
like
someone
took
shitty
beer
and
added
nesquick
to
it
also
no
nice
foamy
top
which
just
made
me
sad
this
beer
needs
to
be
drank
very
cold
out
of
the
bottle
its
the
tits
that
way
super
chocolate
never
gives
up
but
not
sweet
tastecocoa
toasted
malt
cashews
vanilla
faintly
sweet
think
chocolate
frosted
yellow
cake
and
the
flavors
will
reveal
themselves
interesting
flavor
ive
had
other
chocolate
stouts
that
were
decent
but
i
find
this
one
to
be
very
heavy
on
the
chocolate
side
if
you
like
really
sweet
beers
i
say
go
for
it
however
i
find
this
beer
hard
to
drink
and
agree
that
it
tastes
like
a
tootsie
roll
spotted
this
at
whole
foods
bought
it
for
my
birthday
was
a
little
bit
disappointed
with
the
taste
is
no
one
going
to
say
it
it
tastes
exactly
like
a
tootsie
roll
very
good
if
you
like
dessert
beers
i
wish
shiner
made
a
normal
stout
that
they
kept
on
the
shelf
we
need
to
fix
this
outlier
thing
review
not
optional
good
beer
dark
and
intensely
flavorful
with
virtually
no
effervescence
or
bitterness
the
heavy
intense
chocolate
notes
over
power
any
secondary
notes
or
flavors
rendering
birthday
an
occasional
indulgence
not
at
all
refreshing
best
when
served
very
cold
in
a
chilled
glass
i
could
never
drink
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
a
huge
minus
this
beer
is
ridiculous
i
mean
its
really
neat
that
they
got
so
much
flavor
into
the
beer
and
i
have
to
respect
that
because
its
unique
but
i
would
never
be
able
to
finish
a
whole
one
of
these
it
smells
and
tastes
exactly
like
cake
batter
for
a
chocolate
cake
or
brownie
straight
hersheys
in
the
taste
and
the
nose
has
more
of
a
vanilla
cocoa
complexion
but
its
anything
but
subtle
and
the
fact
that
its
a
beer
instead
of
a
milkshake
is
entirely
lost
on
me
aside
from
being
cold
and
wet
nothing
about
this
is
beerlike
at
all
which
obviously
negatively
impacts
my
overall
opinion
of
it
it
hardly
even
seems
like
a
beverage
more
like
a
dessert
so
much
chocolate
at
to
be
diabetic
in
its
sweetness
and
it
never
finishes
i
taste
this
for
hours
i
cool
project
i
suppose
to
invent
the
most
overly
flavorful
beer
ever
brewed
but
it
does
very
little
for
me
in
terms
of
overall
satisfaction
i
encourage
you
to
try
it
though
there
absolutely
isnt
anything
else
like
this
in
the
market
good
beer
for
a
birthday
very
smooth
chocolatey
taste
with
a
thick
tight
foamy
head
reminded
me
of
a
liquid
birthday
cake
a
good
example
of
a
dessert
beer
but
definitely
not
a
stout
the
chocolate
dominates
a
bit
too
much
serving
type
bottle
smells
like
chocolate
cake
one
of
the
best
chocolate
stouts
ive
ever
tasted
tastes
watered
down
nice
chocolate
flavor
but
bad
finish
over
all
not
worth
another
try
a
different
taste
for
a
stout
on
the
sweet
side
actually
tastes
a
little
like
birthday
cake
not
my
favorite
but
i
would
drink
it
again
guess
my
sweet
taste
buds
are
jacked
up
because
this
did
not
taste
as
decadent
as
cake
or
icing
to
me
that
being
said
it
does
exhibit
sweet
toasted
caramel
flavors
but
to
me
not
as
sweet
as
everyone
made
it
seem
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
for
a
birthday
cake
theme
yet
viscosity
could
be
thicker
id
drink
it
again
but
im
still
on
the
hunt
for
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
you
want
to
like
this
yet
the
residual
sugars
and
cloyingly
sweet
character
generally
detract
from
the
beer
overall
it
tastes
like
a
german
chocolate
cake
or
very
sweet
chocolate
fudge
which
may
appeal
to
some
folks
but
for
those
looking
for
a
better
balanced
chocolate
stout
you
may
want
to
keep
looking
way
too
sweet
it
tastes
like
chocolate
frosting
in
a
bottle
dont
get
my
wrong
i
love
chocolate
but
this
is
way
too
rich
it
needs
some
balance

slightly

and
rocky
khaki
head
with
good

that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
nice
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
with
a
moderate
amount
of
streaming
carbonation
retaining
the
head
aromas
of
big
milk
chocolate
cocoa
caramel

vanilla

and
light
toast
very
nice

with
good
balance

on

of
darkroasted

with
zero
cloying

after
the

medium

with
a
very

fairly
creamy
and
lightly
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
zero
warming
present
after
the
finish
as
expected

overall
this
a
very
good
sweet
stout
all
around
good
balance
complexity
and
solid
robustness
of
darkroasted

and
cocoa
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
great
taste
good
choice
it
taste
alot
like
chocolate
very
nice
and
gentle
chocolate
cake
smell
and
taste
good
start
it
does
smell
and
taste
like
really
good
chocolate
cake
at
first
but
middle
and
aftertaste
a
bit
like
that
lame
canfields
chocolate
soda
from
the
1970s
id
buy
it
again
tasted
like
a
chocolate
cupcake
grainy

definitely
a
novelty
pours

smells
of

strong

hint
of

hint
of

and
slight
of
coconut
fits
the
style
of
an
american

feel

clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
chocolate
strong
sweet
malt
hint
of
yeast
hint
of
coconut
and
a
hint
of
wood
overall
this
beer
tastes
the
most
similar
to
actual
chocolate
cake
than
any
beer
ive
ever
had
this
was
quite
appropriate
since
there
is
a
birthday
cake
on
the
bottle
the
chocolate
and
the
sweet
malt
are
very
strong
so
the
balance
is
off
but
i
will
rate
with
the
intention
of
making
a
cake
beer
in
mind
feel
medium
body
smooth
overly
lively
carbonation
tastes
like
chocolate
birthday
cake
but
is
that
a
good
thing
really
sweet
tasting
beer
its
like
a
bottle
of
chocolate
cake
frosting
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
tan
head
smells
like
chocolate
cake
and
kind
of
tastes
like
it
too
not
bad
tastes
like
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
artificial
extract

a
good
beer

almost
black

toasted

i

more

i
was
excited
to
try
this

were
not

subtle
dark

undertones
here
its
like
drinking

is
heavy

chocolate

who
only
drinks
ciders

generally
hates

absolutely
loved
it

i
wish
i
only
bought
one
of

not

only
the

of

at

end
it

this

the

in

big

almost
too
much
though
i
feel
like
im
drinking
a
fizzy

cake
and
couldnt
have
more
than
two
in

that

it

if
you
dont

more

not

very

my
stouts
mostly
liking
irish
dry
stouts
and
not

i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
some
have
noted
it
doesnt
necessarily
have
that
much
of
a
stout
flavor
i
saw
it
for
10
at
another
store
and
hope
that
this
review
will
prevent
someone
from
throwing

away

ap
poured
a
murky
deep
rusty
brown
can
see
light
through
it
giant
caramel
colored
head
slowly
settled
into
just
a
faint
frosting
over
the
top
slight
residual
lacing
pooled
together
very
quickly
ar
smell
was
over
the
top
death
by
chocolate
no
roast
no
nuttiness
just
straight
out
of
the
jar
sugary
frosting
ta
slightly
bitter
licorice
front
gives
way
to
under
baked
chocolate
cake
tastes
like
licking
the
bowl
in
the
finish
mostly
yeasty
raw
egg
mf
super
thin
and
watery
oa
i
was
interested
to
see
if
the
gimmick
worked
no
im
pissed
i
bought
two
bottles
lots
of
chocolate
smell
and
taste
little
thin
on
the
body
a
bit
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
i
like
a
good
stout
but
this
is
not
it
too
much
of
the
birthday
cake
gimmick
it
tastes
like
a
chocolate
protein
shake
glad
i
bought
a
single
smells
better
than
it
tastes
smells
just
like
chocolate
cake
too
thin
for
my
liking
tasted
like
a
stout
with
chocolate
syrup
added
rjt
so
disappointed
chocolate
stout
didnt
live
up
to
the
expectation
this
beer
does
not
start
nor
finish
well
i
like
this
beer
id
be
happy
to
hear
it
if
shiner
decided
to
brew
this
more
than
once
black
in
color
with
a
very
minimal
amount
of
light
penetrating
and
only
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
quarter
inch
of
creamy
beige
head
with
consistently
erupting
tiny
bubbles
of
foam
is
present
this
smells
like
a
hostess
cupcake
nailed
the
aroma
and
dessert
is
served
the
flavor
is
as
advertised
with
the
aroma
sweet
milk
chocolate
in
abundance
the
mouth
is
very
creamy
and
dry
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
and
pair
this
with
raspberries
or
blueberries
you
will
be
in
heaven
pretty
good
beer
comparable
to
many
big
craft
name
stouts
i
enjoyed
it
for
sure
slight
nutty
taste
but
a
nice
rich
stout
taste
great
beer
best
brew
shiner
has
put
out
in
a
while
o
this
one
surprised
me
some
folks
thought
it
was
too
sweet
but
my
wife
and
i
dove
right
in
would
go
well
with
of
course
chocolate
cake
i
like
the
taste
and
smell
it
is
a
good
to
drink
with
a
cohiba
toro
cigar
as
well
the
pair
together
nicely
it
has
a
nice
brown
head
as
well
as
being
a
shiner
beer
anyway
is
enough
the
body
was
ok
smooth
and
even
but
certainly
thin
for
a
stout
drinkability
was
good
my
can
was
gone
quickly
but
im
not
sure
id
have
several
in
a
row
overall
a
pretty
nice
brew
and
one
worth
having
for
a
change
of
pace
nice
chocolate
stout
almost
tastes
like
german
chocolate
cake
if
the
goal
here
was
to
make
a
birthday
cake
stout
for
the
birthday
beer
mission
accomplished
but
its
not
very
stout
like
not
chewy
at
all
still
id
have
another
overall
not
particularly
something
i
would
go
for
again
it
does
have
a
good
chocolate
cake
quality
about
it
im
glad
i
tried
it
though
o
not
a
great
example
of
a
milk
stout
but
still
enjoyable
the
chocolate
flavors
as
slightly
artificial
like
cheap
chocolates
hersheysrussell
stovertootsie
rolls
still
easy
to
drink
and
just
about
sessionable
my
mom
got
me
this
saying
it
was
a
tasty
beer
ive
been
on
a
stout
kick
lately
so
i
was
excited
to
try
it
it
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
watery
simple
flavor
drinkable
but
not
enjoyable
pours
deep
espresso
blackishbrown
with
glimmers
of
cherry
red
when
held
to
the
light
adequatenot
abundanttan
head
with
moderate
lacing
as
the
head
fades
big
nose
aromas
of
dark
cacao
dark
roasted
malts
and
cherries
with
hint
of
birthday
cake
sweetness
in
line
with
the
name
taste
is
lighter
than
the
nose
with
more
of
the
birthday
cake
coming
forward
in
front
of
the
chocolate
with
a
slightly
higher
carbonation
than
expected
for
a
stout
enjoyable
to
drink
glad
i
bought
as
single
and
not
a
sixpack
normally
big
fan
of
spoeztls
offerings
and
may
go
for
a
single
again
next
year
of
course
this
was
for
a
birthday
party
chocolate
cocoa
bomb
not
overly
sweet
better
as
it
warms
great
with
chocolate
almond
mocha
cake
extremely
artificial
tasting
the
worst
chocolate
stout
i
have
ever
had
i
really
injoyed
this
beer
tasty
drinkable
a
good
chocolate
flavor
thin
artificial
mess
i
had
seen
some
decent
reviews
for
this
and
figured
i
would
give
it
a
chance
when
i
saw
a
single
if
this
were
cakeadvocate
this
beer
would
get
a
solid
5
as
a
beer
its
damn
close
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
average
tasting
example
of
the
style
when
it
came
to
the
aroma
it
was
much
more
chocolate
cake
like
than
i
ever
expected
it
would
be
but
that
never
really
carried
over
to
the
taste
and
in
the
end
i
was
a
little
let
down
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
watery
a
little
creamy
slightly
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
is
enough
for
me
the
taste
doesnt
really
make
me
want
to
go
back
for
more
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
good
and
to
me
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
lacked
that
rich
chocolate
cake
aspect
that
the
aroma
had
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
if
they
release
it
next
year
but
it
isnt
something
im
going
to
stock
up
on
and
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
if
you
really
like
chocolate
stouts
but
i
dont
find
it
to
be
a
stand
out
for
the
style
all
in
all
i
wasnt
to
impressed
with
this
beer
the
aroma
was
just
a
little
impressive
but
the
taste
was
not
and
it
left
me
wanting
more
out
of
this
beer
so
far
this
beer
falls
right
in
the
middle
for
shiner
and
i
think
its
a
pretty
average
example
of
the
style
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
with
some
work
it
could
be
much
better
better
luck
next
time
guys
overall
wow
happy
birthday
shiner
this
is
pretty
special
i
dont
think
it
would
hold
up
well
in
the
cellar
so
ill
have
to
hope
they
make
more
in
the
future
until
then
im
getting
another
6er
not
terrible
for
what
it
is
somebody
had
to
make
a
chocolate
stout
for
people
who
read
chocolate
on
a
beer
label
and
want
chocolate
shiner
did
it
bummed
by
the
low
abv
for
a
stout
otherwise
color
and
flavor
are
there
maybe
garnish
with
mint
bought
this
on
a
whim
as
i
love
stouts
especially
chocolate
stouts
and
this
is
under
3
for
the
bomber
so
figured
why
not
awesome
chocolate
smell
off
the
bat
had
me
encouraged
sadly
this
was
the
highlight
moutfeel
weird
rather
thin
and
yes
i
realize
this
is
a
lower
abv
stout
but
expected
more
almost
like
water
the
taste
is
just
off
putting
i
guess
its
chocolate
but
more
of
the
fake
imitation
chocolate
you
run
across
it
reminds
me
when
as
a
kid
my
dad
would
get
cheap
and
buy
the
store
brand
chocolate
syrup
yes
its
chocolate
syrup
but
it
was
obvious
it
wasnt
the
real
thing
outside
of
the
nice
smell
this
beer
is
a
great
example
for
other
on
how
not
to
make
a
chocolate
stout
low
d
o
overall
loved
this
beer
very
much
had
at
home
mostly
in
recliner
in
a
large
osdh
snifter
from
bottle
really
great
chocolate
stout
tastes
like
a
chocolate
cake
like
drinking
liquid
chocolate
cake
tons
chocolate
dough
faint
licorice
mild
roasted
malt
smells
like
bakery
taste
chocolate
cake
light
roast
slight
bitter
sweet
finish
solid
dark
brown
with
ruby
at
the
edges
huge
hersheys
chocolate
syrup
aroma
dominates
letting
little
else
through
brownie
batter
and
milk
chocolate
flavors
abound
kind
of
sweet
and
one
dimensional
but
satisfies
like
licking
a
bowl
of
batter
does
overall
had
to
pour
most
of
this
down
the
drain
thank
goodness
there
are
plenty
of
good
craft
breweries
in
texas
to
make
up
for
the
damage
that
shiner
has
done
smooth
beer
tastes
like
chocolate
clean
finish
and
easy
on
carb
ok
this
is
a
birthday
cake
chocolate
stout
i
will
not
compare
this
to
a
serious
ris
or
ba
stout
because
i
do
not
believe
spoetzl
was
going
for
that
this
is
a
sweet
chocolate
stout
schocolate
a
little
hops
and
some
roasted
malts
tchocolate
and
yes
chocolate
frosting
i
think
if
i
were
to
drink
a
liquid
tootsie
roll
it
would
taste
like
this
no
bitterness
present
in
this
stout
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
after
having
this
on
tap
on
nye
it
is
a
sweet
desert
beer
and
i
treat
it
as
such
it
is
only
a
5
0
abv
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
but
again
i
dont
think
they
were
trying
to
put
out
such
a
stout
this
is
certainly
a
tasty
stout
and
a
treat
i
wouldnt
drink
one
every
night
but
i
like
having
it
in
the
fridge
i
will
pick
up
more
for
the
non
beer
friends
that
come
over
and
for
the
occasional
sweet
low
abv
beer
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
coming
from
spoetzl
but
i
think
they
did
a
great
job
on
this
beer
considering
what
it
is
not
bad
a
bit
sweet
but
easily
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
ever
had
from
these
guys
a
bit
one
dimensional
though
a
nice
novelty
beer
to
hand
out
on
birthdays
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
trip
to
uncharted
territory
for
the
spoetzl
brewery
i
like
it
genuinely
surprised
with
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
o
birthday
cake
in
a
bottle
pairs
well
with
one
amazing
chocolate
smell
great
taste
one
of
the
best
chocolate
stouts
ive
had
great
chocolate
flavor
and
nice
stout
body
this
beer
smells
amazing
and
has
a
delightful
taste
to
match
definitely
a
favorite
of
the
winter
season
my
wife
and
i
would
love
to
see
shiner
dabble
in
with
barrel
stouts
now
normally
i
dont
like
chocolate
stouts
however
shiner
has
converted
me
on
this
one
as
soon
as
you
smell
it
it
smells
like
chocolate
syrup
but
it
is
delicious
super
thin
smells
and
tastes
artificial
i
do
not
recommend
and
sent
the
brewery
a
note
stating
such
black
opaque
body
thin
brown
head
aroma
is
laden
with
sweet
chocolate
not
much
else
lots
of
chocolate
too
much
chocolate
taste
brings
more
of
the
same
like
russell
stover
chocolate
candies
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
slick
pretty
one
sided
and
artificial
tasting
not
a
lot
of
beer
qualities
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
chocolate
with
hints
of
cherry
i
didnt
notice
that
much
carbonation
like
some
of
the
other
reviews
i
thought
it
was
a
fine
stout
its
not
a
heavy
stout
its
very
much
like
a
chocolate
milk
shake
with
alcohol
in
it
big
chocolate
milk
aroma
definitely
tastes
like
chocolate
as
well
more
milk
chocolate
than
dark
chocolate
with
sweeter
notes
that
is
a
all
good
but
the
body
on
this
is
really
lacking
it
is
thin
and
too
carbonated
not
sure
which
of
those
two
attributes
bothers
me
more
probably
the
carbonation
a
nice
creamy
but
thin
bodied
stout
is
fine
in
my
book
but
this
drinks
too
charged
up
im
tempted
to
just
let
it
sit
for
a
few
hours
to
see
if
it
drinks
any
better
they
got
the
chocolate
part
in
there
for
sure
though
i
would
not
buy
again
drank
this
straight
out
of
the
bottle
because
its
just
a
shiner
its
very
light
for
a
stout
but
i
was
expecting
that
the
cocoa
flavor
is
very
prominent
with
an
initial
unpleasant
stale
beer
flavor
right
behind
that
cocoa
flavour
whats
kind
of
cool
though
is
that
the
aftertaste
is
very
much
like
chocolate
cake
and
not
unpleasant
at
all
tastes
and
smells
like
chocolate
milk
i
really
dont
like
it
very
tasty
chocolate
stout
tastes
like
chocolate
cake
without
being
sweet
its
a
good
stout
but
nothing
really
special
unnatural
flavoring
odd
smell
and
a
lingering
unpleasant
aftertaste
i
am
not
great
at
describing
the
taste
of
beer
or
what
notes
a
beer
drinker
can
derive
from
a
beer
but
this
stuff
tastes
like
duncan
hines
chocolate
cake
no
notes
of
a
stout
exist
in
this
beer
that
is
it
does
not
taste
like
any
stout
i
have
ever
had
it
tastes
and
smells
exactly
like
chocolate
cake
made
from
a
store
bought
mix
avoid
it
and
do
not
buy
as
a
birthday
beer
for
your
girlfriend
as
you
will
both
be
quite
disappointed
unless
you
dont
care
for
beer
but
enjoy
cake
from
a
box
mix
i
could
see
somebody
in
those
shoes
liking
it
i
only
gave
a
decent
rating
for
the
smell
because
i
like
the
smell
of
chocolate
cake
from
a
box
mix
or
from
scratch
shiner
you
failed
once
again
shabbiest
brewery
in
texas
hands
down
the
beer
smells
and
tastes
like
wort
i
still
like
me
some
shiner
black
and
cheer
but
unless
they
were
trying
to
hit
some
obscure
version
of
a
chocolate
stout
which
maybe
they
were
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
for
this
one
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
i
drank
it
from
a
bottle
40
degrees
tasted
exactly
like
a
chocolate
cake
an
almost
too
rich
chocolate
cake
pours
a
very
deep
chocolate
brown
letting
hardly
any
light
through
decent
mocha
head
and
tremendous
lacing
aroma
is
of
hot
chocolate
and
maybe
a
small
hint
of
coffee
taste
is
of
hot
chocolate
there
is
a
subtle
ending
taste
of
coffee
also
this
beer
has
nice
carbonation
and
feels
great
going
down
this
is
slightly
on
the
weaker
side
as
stouts
go
but
the
hot
chocolate
flavor
makes
it
happy
birthday
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
black
letting
no
light
through
when
held
to
light
bulb
one
finger
thick
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
very
little
lacing
s
rich
chocolate
and
mocha
with
a
hint
of
bitter
hops
very
subtle
hints
of
dark
fruit
like
raisin
and
date
t
immediately
hit
with
strong
dark
chocolate
almost
too
rich
but
then
the
bold
chocolate
is
balanced
out
with
coffee
and
mocha
flavors
aftertaste
leaves
mainly
mochawithhints
of
bitter
hops
and
dark
fruits
m
smooth
very
little
carbonation
more
dominant
froth
like
you
would
get
from
a
guinness
o
great
beer
for
the
winter
or
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
shiner
did
a
great
job
making
this
limited
edition
106
year
anniversary
beer
o
if
theres
such
a
thing
as
a
light
stout
but
it
is
still
present
nevertheless
goes
down
smooth
i
would
recommend
this
beer
with
a
doughnut
or
strudel
sounds
strange
blueberries
add
a
nice
subtle
touch
to
the
aroma
and
taste
of
this
stout
feel
is
nice
as
well
enjoyable
try
it
overeall
this
is
definitely
a
different
take
on
a
stout
its
decently
good
i
enjoy
that
its
not
a
blueberry
bomb
and
that
the
stout
flavors
can
meld
with
it
there
is
some
sort
of
subtle
off
flavor
i
get
however
perhaps
from
the
artificial
flavoring
i
also
get
a
sense
of
lactose
on
the
finish
that
is
odd
to
me
becuase
i
dont
think
its
a
milk
stout
for
me
the
aftertaste
is
the
biggest
negative
to
this
beer
all
in
all
worth
checking
out
as
a
fun
beer
but
its
a
one
and
done
for
me
overall
a
very
good
twist
on
a
stout
the
blueberries
add
a
nice
fruity
kick
without
making
things
overly
sweet
solid
chocolate
malt
notes
i
endorse
this
beer
smell
was
great
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
overall
a
nice
sipper
for
a
cold
day
that
reminds
of
summer
but
is
thoroughly
imbued
with
the
essence
of
winter
meh
not
my
type
of
beer
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
not
a
1010
for
someone
else
a
very
tasty
stout
but
dont
be
intimidated
by
the
addition
of
blueberry
the
fruit
adds
very
mild
undertones
not
at
all
overpowering
the
blueberries
gives
the
look
a
darkish
purple
kinda
sexy
ha
the
smell
is
not
over
powering
mild
one
can
say
it
is
kind
of
sweet
for
stout
but
not
all
that
bad
it
feels
light
on
the
tongue
however
it
is
very
easy
to
swallow
overall
this
is
one
of
those
stouts
that
you
can
get
sexy
with
your
woman
with
not
too
boozy
yet
not
too
overpowering
either
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
12oz
bottle
poured
into
stout
glass
very
dark
brownand
opaque
half
finger
of
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
aroma
is
roasty
with
clear
but
not
overpowering
blueberry
also
there
is
dark
roast
coffee
and
a
little
alcohol
taste
is
initially
roast
coffee
and
dark
cocoa
bitterness
with
blueberry
and
chocolate
sweetness
mediumfull
body
creamy
and
a
bit
oily
in
texture
low
carbonation
lingering
berry
sweetness
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
solid
stout
with
a
twist
for
those
times
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
different
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
i
have
no
real
complaints
either
overall
a
good
stout
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
blueberry
stout
skip
it
if
you
are
looking
for
something
that
has
blueberry
flavor
i
didnt
expect
this
thing
to
taste
like
koolaid
or
anything
but
some
blueberry
flavor
would
have
been
nice
o
just
not
good
really
weird
pours
a
very
deep
opaque
black
with
just
a
skin
of
head
nose
is
dominated
by
smoke
and
roast
but
the
berry
is
clearly
present
flavor
is
dry
and
smokey
with
a
bit
of
berry
sweetness
balancing
palate
was
exceptionly
clean
even
all
these
big
flavors
its
was
good
but
the
blueberry
taste
was
real
fake
had
this
beer
last
night
and
when
i
first
opened
the
beer
the
blueberry
smell
was
strong
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
thinking
the
blueberry
taste
should
have
been
a
little
stronger
it
isnt
bad
enjoy
the
blueberry
but
this
combo
could
be
better
nice
try
dark
horse
i
dont
have
a
great
analysis
here
i
just
didnt
enjoy
the
flavor
of
the
beer
thin
artificial
blueberry
flavor
and
generally
not
very
good
pretty
descent
fruit
stout
it
lacks
for
lacing
and
is
really
thin
which
is
a
shame
however
it
smells
like
a
proper
stout
with
dark
chocolate
oak
char
and
malt
with
a
hint
of
blueberries
taste
is
similar
with
the
blueberries
amping
up
the
dark
fruit
on
the
palate
excellent
thick
brown
head
nice
sweet
smell
good
stout
texture
not
quite
as
thick
as
i
like
my
stout
but
damn
good
would
definitely
consider
buying
this
to
share
with
friends
who
like
something
different
to
try
not
what
id
buy
a
case
of
to
knock
back
at
home
by
myself
but
still
a
great
beer
for
me
its
a
winter
beer
not
a
hot
hard
day
at
work
beer
im
actually
enjoying
one
right
now
i
love
the
smell
and
color
definitely
blueberry
nice
change
from
all
the
raspberry
beers
a
ba
version
would
be
probably
really
good
desert
in
a
bottle
tastes
so
good
but
having
more
than
two
isnt
recommended
kind
of
like
a
brownie
you
can
have
too
much
a
good
thing
overall
i
was
intrigued
by
the
idea
of
a
blueberry
stout
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
probably
wont
go
after
it
again
though
sorry
dark
horse
but
plead
the
5th
is
so
much
better
its
nice
that
the
addition
of
blueberries
is
subtle
feels
natural
and
helps
the
dark
fruit
characteristic
of
the
beer
without
messing
with
the
great
stout
notes
of
this
beer
its
blueberry
its
a
stout
i
wish
the
blueberry
werent
so
dominant
but
were
more
of
an
accent
to
a
nice
stout
not
something
id
drink
regularly
o
good
stout
but
i
was
hoping
for
bigger
nose
and
stronger
flavors
eh
not
bad
but
theres
nothing
here
that
really
makes
me
want
another
one
the
kind
of
beer
that
you
only
have
one
of
at
a
time
o
not
quite
as
delicious
as
shipyards
smashed
blueberry
this
flavorful
stout
does
have
an
ample
blueberry
component
an
appealing
aroma
and
nicely
balanced
flavors
it
pours
a
purplish
black
if
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
right
blueberry
and
dark
chocolate
aromas
make
for
a
sweet
start
however
a
roasted
teetering
on
bitter
aftertaste
aids
the
drinkability
there
is
a
dry
cocoa
powder
flavor
that
makes
it
sessionable
despite
its
abv
combined
with
the
juicy
sweet
blueberry
aromas
at
the
beginning
it
just
makes
you
want
to
sip
and
wish
you
had
a
porch
swing
o
dark
horse
holds
it
own
again
with
another
above
par
beer
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
never
had
a
blueberry
stout
before
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
extremely
drinkable
wish
it
was
available
in
my
region
a
really
nice
light
tasting
stout
mild
amounts
of
blueberry
flavors
mild
alcohol
presence
medium
amount
of
sweetness
but
so
well
balanced
that
it
just
drinks
so
well
to
me
not
as
full
bodied
as
it
claims
but
thats
ok
its
nice
to
have
a
light
fruity
stout
that
goes
down
smoothly
my
second
beer
regular
pt5
was
the
first
from
this
brewery
and
im
not
disappointed
so
far
very
nice
looks
thin
but
has
rather
low
abv
for
a
stout
so
that
is
understandable
has
a
good
smell
nice
roasty
notes
with
some
light
chocolate
and
lots
blueberry
taste
has
less
blueberry
than
the
nose
but
it
still
very
present
and
makes
for
a
solid
brew
fairly
well
balanced
but
needs
a
little
more
body
imo
an
amazing
stout
dark
horse
continues
to
impress
me
terrifically
enjoyable
a
good
take
on
a
classic
style
might
be
worth
a
new
look
when
the
season
warms
up
think
summer
bbq
at
night
or
bonfire
on
the
beach
snifter
as
a
brewer
i
understand
the
complexity
of
fruit
incorporation
to
any
type
of
beer
let
alone
the
incorporation
of
blue
berries
into
a
stout
total
blueberry
and
coffee
roast
along
with
a
subtle
sweetness
from
a
light
lactose
addition
medium
body
with
a
nice
chocolaty
roast
finish
carbs
fill
the
gap
nice
job
guys
cheers
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
dark
horse
its
not
often
you
see
a
fruit
infused
stout
turn
out
to
be
as
tasty
as
this
one
is
again
the
blueberry
is
there
to
accent
this
beer
not
turn
it
into
fruit
juice
if
i
had
any
complaint
itd
be
that
id
like
it
to
be
a
bit
more
bold
on
the
flavor
more
blueberry
and
more
roasty
depth
this
stuff
tastes
great
as
it
is
but
uhm
maybe
an
imperial
version
dark
horse
just
a
thought
definitely
try
this
one
out
o
overall
my
only
complaint
is
not
much
complexity
though
overall
this
is
very
tasty
id
love
to
bake
this
into
a
dessert
with
blueberries
o
though
i
like
shipyards
smashed
blueberry
just
a
tad
better
this
is
a
very
well
done
blueberry
stout
with
balanced
flavors
a
soft
mouthfeel
and
enticing
aroma
o
always
try
a
beer
twice
i
was
unhappy
with
the
amount
of
blueberry
on
my
first
try
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
fruit
beer
this
is
a
stout
with
a
blueberry
aroma
and
maybe
some
flavor
in
that
first
sip
of
head
i
will
be
picking
up
another
4
pk
if
i
see
one
still
on
the
shelves
on
draft
at
global
brew
huge
aroma
of
blueberry
muffins
jet
black
with
minimal
head
surprisingly
not
as
much
blueberry
when
tasted
flavors
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
with
subtle
blueberry
not
thick
or
syrupy
rather
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
finish
would
definitely
recommend
great
fruit
stout
the
blueberry
goes
great
with
the
with
dark
grains
will
definitely
look
for
this
again
o
this
is
a
terrific
stout
unique
with
the
addition
of
blueberries
this
may
be
the
best
fruit
stout
ive
had
it
manages
to
mix
disparate
concepts
fruit
sweetness
and
stout
roast
the
blueberry
comes
out
more
bready
as
a
muffin
but
that
seems
to
work
with
the
overall
stout
properties
my
scores
are
probably
a
bit
lower
then
they
should
be
simply
because
i
dont
care
all
that
much
for
blueberries
that
said
the
fact
that
my
scores
are
as
high
as
they
are
is
indicative
of
the
quality
of
this
beer
the
sweet
roasty
and
tart
flavors
defy
logic
and
actually
come
together
to
make
a
pleasant
beer
so
what
im
trying
to
say
is
its
light
on
the
blueberries
but
ill
be
ok
booboo
says
hi
this
beer
is
wonderful
i
find
myself
lost
in
the
beer
isle
of
my
local
liquor
store
i
see
this
4
pack
and
it
calls
out
to
me
i
always
wait
for
one
to
do
that
to
me
ive
had
this
beer
again
and
again
over
the
years
ill
agree
with
some
other
posts
i
have
seen
as
the
head
does
not
have
very
good
retention
but
when
it
is
there
is
has
a
nice
red
color
this
beer
is
pitch
black
and
oily
it
has
the
most
wonderful
aroma
of
blueberries
and
smokey
malts
dark
horse
makes
a
fantastic
stout
ive
had
them
all
but
this
one
is
my
favorite
if
there
wasnt
blueberries
in
it
and
it
was
just
a
little
thicker
this
would
be
a
perfect
regular
stout
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
there
is
the
slightest
bite
which
i
figure
comes
from
the
fruit
while
the
taste
is
definitely
not
what
you
would
expect
and
i
only
say
that
because
you
would
think
blueberry
would
be
most
prominent
which
it
is
not
the
rest
of
the
smell
meets
taste
in
perfect
symmetry
the
mouth
feel
is
watery
for
a
stout
of
this
abv
but
it
is
almost
chewy
which
i
like
this
is
art
in
my
opinion
and
its
relatively
cheap
in
my
opinion
for
a
beer
of
this
quality
id
love
to
have
this
on
tap
i
recommend
o
ill
take
a
blueberry
stout
over
a
generic
blueberry
apa
any
day
the
flavor
is
just
much
more
suitable
to
a
thick
dark
beer
and
this
one
is
pleasant
and
distinctive
and
is
a
nice
alternative
to
spiced
winter
ales
alcohol
and
antioxidants
sure
o
tres
blueberry
is
just
delicious
it
would
be
a
very
good
stout
without
the
addition
of
blueberry
but
by
adding
it
theyve
created
a
ridiculously
smooth
bodied
stout
without
really
even
needing
a
thicker
texture
this
stout
gets
its
blueberry
notes
across
but
takes
nothing
away
from
the
stout
experience
itself
maybe
one
of
the
better
examples
of
pulling
a
bold
stout
off
most
overdue
the
fruit
this
has
a
slap
of
fruit
while
still
delivering
a
true
american
stout
this
is
a
true
classic
very
great
smelling
beer
showcases
the
blueberries
quite
well
somewhat
the
same
for
the
flavour
though
it
could
be
executed
a
little
bit
better
im
not
going
to
complain
that
much
just
because
this
beer
smells
so
damn
good
as
far
as
i
know
there
arent
a
lot
of
blueberry
stouts
out
there
so
this
one
is
at
least
unique
and
interesting
i
still
prefer
one
oatmeal
to
this
but
this
one
ill
certainly
buy
again
a
very
enjoyable
stout
that
perfectly
integrates
enjoyable
blueberry
flavors
an
excellent
and
unique
stout
that
is
well
worth
trying
d
this
was
a
very
nice
blueberry
stout
the
scent
and
taste
were
simple
but
delicious
the
body
was
weak
but
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
very
nice
brew
wow
a
dark
stout
labelled
as
a
blueberry
with
an
actual
honesttogoodness
blueberry
taste
dh
really
pulled
off
a
feat
with
this
issue
tough
to
combine
a
good
stout
taste
with
a
blueberry
flavor
without
one
drowning
the
other
but
the
balance
is
remarkable
here
drink
it
if
you
like
a
stout
or
drink
it
if
you
like
blueberry
but
if
you
like
both
then
this
is
a
musthave
o
my
first
blueberry
stout
and
one
that
i
would
try
again
loved
the
aroma
and
the
blueberry
worked
nicely
with
the
chocolaty
malt
o
a
very
good
beer
i
usually
dont
like
fruit
beers
but
with
one
just
works
it
probably
helps
that
they
know
how
to
make
a
good
stout
and
then
figured
out
how
to
complement
it
with
a
nice
fruit
addition
definitely
recommended
for
any
stout
lover
you
might
not
love
it
but
it
is
worth
trying
o
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brew
let
me
start
off
by
saying
the
smell
was
phenomenal
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
overly
sweet
and
it
wasnt
in
fact
its
a
great
definition
of
a
stout
minus
the
bleberries
now
ive
never
had
a
blueberry
stout
so
nothing
to
base
it
off
of
but
definitely
in
the
top
3
blueberry
alone
any
style
smell
ive
encountered
personally
ive
had
better
stouts
base
beer
wise
but
this
as
well
is
definitelyup
there
its
no
bumb
i
just
think
the
folks
over
at
dark
horse
blended
together
a
perfectly
balanced
stout
nothings
overdone
for
me
me
and
all
the
flavors
come
out
and
stay
for
the
perfect
amounts
of
time
definitely
recommend
o
this
stout
is
delicious
it
would
be
great
without
the
blueberries
but
the
fruit
just
serves
as
a
great
complement
to
the
sweet
chocolate
and
bitter
coffee
because
of
that
its
a
nearly
perfectly
executed
fruit
beer
the
base
beer
is
great
but
the
fruit
improves
it
on
top
of
all
that
it
is
insanely
drinkable
great
beer
from
dark
horse
thanks
a
ton
jared
great
range
of
flavor
blueberry
chocolate
cream
licorice
id
love
to
see
more
brewers
take
a
stab
at
this
concept
this
is
an
interesting
attempt
to
meld
fruit
with
stout
but
in
the
end
both
the
blueberry
flavor
and
the
roasted
bitterness
are
too
muted
to
make
for
a
true
masterpiece

texturally
they
may

stiffen
it
up

these
type

beers
get
and
not
gimmicky
beer
is

b
o
a
good
blueberry
stout
just
not
sure
id
go
for
more
cheers
the
body
is
thick
and
rich
theres
a
good
carbonation
that
isnt
too
high
but
gives
it
some
creaminess
along
with
just
enough
crispness
to
make
for
an
even
feel
that
doesnt
bite
too
much
for
a
stout
overall
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
one
but
there
was
almost
no
flavor
in
this
beer
it
was
just
ash
tray
and
some
blueberry
with
a
rounder
malt
profile
this
would
have
been
a
far
better
experience
i
love
me
a
dark
beer
and
i
think
we
can
all
agree
that
its
hard
to
find
a
stout
or
porter
with
a
particular
fruit
in
its
name
this
beer
covered
all
the
main
components
of
a
spectacular
stout
and
one
upd
it
by
adding
a
perfect
amount
of
blueberry
to
it
smells
of
blueberries
pours
completely
black
tastes
of
chocolate
coffee
and
blueberries
has
a
fairly
pleasant
mouth
feel
overall
this
beer
was
all
that
i
wanted
and
was
expecting
there
are
countless
amounts
of
fruit
wheat
beers
but
how
many
fruit
stouts
do
you
have
this
beer
could
replace
coffee
and
pie
for
dessert
o
enjoyable
and
great
spin
on
an
imperial
stout
beautiful
dark
stout
with
foamy
brown
head
berry
beers
are
not
typically
my
favorite
but
the
blueberry
taste
is
not
sugary
or
overwhelming
coffee
and
caramel
taste
pairs
perfectly
with
the
blueberry
there
is
a
strong
chocolate
aftertaste
but
not
too
bitter
very
nice
beer
for
anytime
of
the
year
o
hey
i
dont
like
false
advertising
and
dark
horse
wasnt
lying
with
the
name
lots
of
blueberry
in
the
smell
and
taste
even
a
little
in
the
color
it
actually
works
really
well
blueberry
coffee
chocolate
delicious
dark
brownopaque
with
a
creamy
mocha
brown
head
ok
retention
and
no
lasting
lace
aroma
is
dark
and
roasty
with
the
light
sweetness
of
blueberries
a
surprisingly
pleasing
combination
that
goes
really
well
together
taste
is
chocolately
and
malty
kind
of
lactoseesque
with
blueberry
weaved
in
throughout
it
adds
a
lot
to
the
smoothness
and
the
suckdownability
im
not
trying
to
drink
this
fast
but
i
definitely
seem
to
be
mouthfeel
is
smooth
slick
soft
and
blankety
stout
appropriate
overall
i
think
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
was
a
little
weary
of
the
blueberry
at
first
but
it
works
really
well
with
this
style
pours
an
inky
solid
black
brimming
with
offwhite
foam
some
lacing
is
present
as
well
taking
in
the
aroma
i
could
tell
that
this
brew
would
exceed
my
expectations
fruit
flavored
beers
have
always
been
very
hit
or
miss
with
me
the
smells
i
picked
up
were
those
of
luscious
desserts
and
bakery
treats
natural
blueberry
muffin
pie
crust
cappuccino
dark
roasted
malts
the
flavor
of
the
blueberry
was
front
and
center
but
there
was
an
unexpected
and
pleasant
smoked
character
as
well
slightly
bready
it
coats
the
mouth
nicely
with
a
moderate
chewiness
and
a
crisp
finish
dont
hesitate
to
pick
this
up
even
for
those
wary
of
fruit
beer
pours
black
three
finger
coffee
head
that
dissipates
quickly
you
can
smell
the
blueberries
immediately
on
the
pour
nose
is
pretty
much
all
blueberries
and
kinda
artificial
blueberries
at
that
taste
isnt
gimmicky
though
probably
the
crispiest
stout
ive
ever
had
lots
o
carbonation
that
seems
to
fit
balance
of
malts
against
the
sweet
blueberry
is
right
on
its
unlike
any
stout
that
ive
had
i
have
to
admit
i
like
it
o
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
the
blueberry
flavor
and
aromas
are
very
juicy
and
pielike
and
fits
nicely
with
the
chocolate
and
roast
very
tasty
stuff
overall
a
very
interesting
and
different
fruit
infused
stout
i
like
the
blueberry
flavors
more
than
cherry
that
usually
comes
in
stout
not
sure
if
id
get
this
again
but
a
very
interesting
and
solid
beer
o
not
a
pure
stout
but
it
works
well
as
a
stoutfruit
beer
hybrid
the
blueberry
does
a
good
job
of
blending
in
with
the
base
never
fully
overpowering
things
id
gladly
drink
this
one
again
o
overall
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
flavors
from
the
malts
and
the
blueberry
i
thought
this
was
pretty
interesting
but
not
sure
i
would
have
another
in
a
single
session
o
the
beer
has
a
nice
balance
between
fruity
and
stout
flavors
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
opaque
blackish
color
with
a
thin
filmy
brown
head
that
clings
around
the
glass
aromas
of
blueberry
tart
and
sweet
with
a
heavy
dose
of
roasted
coffee
in
the
backbone
flavors
are
rich
and
creamy
with
a
mocha
backbone
giving
rise
to
a
subtle
sweet
blueberry
ribbon
of
sweetness
the
fruit
imparts
a
blueberry
muffin
character
to
the
brew
and
there
are
roasty
highlights
throughout
very
robust
on
a
smooth
full
body
roasty
and
fruity
aftertaste
with
a
balancing
bitterness
clean
slightly
dry
finish
very
good
serving
type
12oz

poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
thanks
for
reading
pours
opaque
black
with
a
thick
one
finger
brown
head
that
sticks
the
nose
reminds
me
of
blueberry
morning
breakfast
cereal
a
sweetened
dehydrated
blueberry
aroma
flits
above
the
surface
but
underneath
is
an
almost
nutty
bran
muffin
and
hint
of
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
is
not
quite
as
integrated
as
the
nose
it
starts
off
with
an
artificial
blueberry
flavor
with
a
tinge
of
sweetener
that
somewhat
sloppily
transitions
into
a
moderate
roasty
finish
by
way
of
a
kick
of
tartness
and
astringency
on
the
midpalate
overall
blueberry
is
one
of
my
favorite
flavors
and
i
think
it
really
worked
in
this
one
i
look
forward
to
picking
up
a
couple
of
these
up
every
winter
o
well
i
finally
found
it
not
that
i
was
looking
really
hard
but
it
was
a
nice
surprise
thumbs
up
to
dark
horse
brewers
for
mixing
blueberries
with
stout
so
well
very
pleasant
drink
mellow
and
lulling
also
have
to
add
that
at
the
end
those
7
5
abv
start
to
get
through
oi
have
mixed
blueberry
lagers
and
stouts
before
but
this
beer
takes
the
cake
blueberry
is
not
artificial
nor
overpowering
in
the
taste
a
great
beer
overall
everything
about
this
beer
intrigued
me
from
the
start
the
simple
label
the
blueberry
in
a
stout
the
dark
horse
branding
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
the
beer
had
plenty
of
surprises
and
the
only
disappoint
if
any
was
that
the
blueberry
was
a
little
underwhelming
however
still
turned
out
to
be
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
would
most
certainly
pick
up
again
typical
stout
appearance
near
black
opaque
body
with
a
thick
beige
head
the
aroma
brings
the
blueberries
right
away
blueberry
chocolate
roast
smells
very
inviting
the
flavor
offers
more
roast
and
chocolate
initially
with
blueberries
coming
in
mid
palate
quite
tasty
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
i
was
expecting
dry
finish
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
time
to
buy
a
couple
4
packs
o
i
love
blueberries
so
this
was
a
must
buy
and
i
personally
thought
it
was
rather
enjoyable
i
was
wondering
how
much
blueberries
would
actually
be
noticed
but
as
this
brew
warms
up
the
blueberries
really
start
to
come
forward
drinkable
and
overall
pretty
tasty
nice
fruit
addition
without
being
too
gimmicky
or
played
out
blueberry
might
be
a
little
too
much
as
this
one
approaches
warmer
temps
though
although
i
still
dont
know
how
i
feel
about
fruity
stouts
this
one
may
make
a
believer
out
of
certain
skeptics
o
i
enjoy
fruit
notes
in
stouts
and
this
one
is
no
exception
i
always
pick
up
a
4
pack
each
year
overall
i
was
expecting
a
lot
out
of
this
one
but
it
underwhelmed
and
am
i
glad
i
bought
a
single
rather
than
a
four
pack
or
even
two
for
that
matter
overall
i
love
blueberries
so
i
had
to
give
this
one
a
shot
what
i
can
say
about
this
is
that
it
is
very
interesting
a
great
beer
no
a
solid
not
typical
offering
yes
wasnt
sure
about
this
one
but
worth
a
try
pours
pitch
black
with
a
brown
one
finger
head
really
gorgeous
pour
aroma
not
helping
me
want
to
drink
this
i
can
tell
it
is
a
mix
of
blueberry
and
chocolate
but
really
it
kind
of
smells
like
vomit
by
kind
of
i
mean
it
literally
smells
like
last
nights
dinner
coming
back
for
an
encore
just
weird
luckily
the
flvaor
starts
out
okay
not
much
blueberry
going
on
to
start
but
the
flavor
is
very
roasty
with
hints
of
chocolate
definite
bitternessnot
expected
at
this
level
from
a
sweet
stoutand
there
are
definitely
hops
here
slight
tinge
of
blueberry
roasty
smokey
aftertaste
with
some
cocoa
as
i
get
through
it
a
bit
more
the
blueberry
really
starts
coming
out
on
the
finish
and
then
all
the
way
through
this
just
ends
up
becoming
an
all
blueberry
beer
sweeter
and
sweeter
as
i
go
ultimately
a
drainpour
i
just
cant
deal
with
this
one
admittedly
i
am
not
a
huge
blueberry
fan
anyway
higher
carbonation
for
a
stout
which
keeps
it
a
bit
lighter
than
it
actually
is
on
the
palate
overall
i
guess
they
hit
what
they
were
going
for
but
need
to
work
on
that
truly
effed
up
aroma
pi
would
think
even
for
those
who
are
blueberry
fans
certainly
different
and
interestingly
complex
but
not
for
me
it
was
worth
a
try
o
this
is
an
excellent
stout
has
the
usual
characteristics
an
average
stout
but
the
blueberries
and
hoppy
finish
just
make
this
beer
o
overall
i
bought
this
due
to
all
the
fans
and
heard
it
was
one
of
the
best
of
the
series
not
sure
if
the
bottle
sludge
matters
or
not
but
possibly
it
does
who
knows
interesting
but
flawed
pours
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
moderate
tan
head
that
recedes
to
a
creamy
topping
blueberry
is
definitely
apparent
in
the
aroma
blending
with
some
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
berries
take
it
down
a
notch
in
the
mouth
as
the
flavor
opens
with
more
of
a
dark
charred
maltiness
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
roasted
coffee
almost
like
a
dry
stout
before
the
blueberry
enters
and
permeates
all
the
nooks
and
crannies
with
lightly
tart
juicy
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
some
texture
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
perhaps
not
quite
as
impressive
as
the
first
two
holiday
stout
series
beers
for
me
but
still
a
satisfying
and
intriguing
brew
that
im
sure
ill
try
again
very
good
stout
would
definitely
recommend
overall
nice
beer
balanced
well
and
fun
to
drink
blueberry
works
well
not
overly
sweet
or
overpowering
has
the
right
amount
of
tart
sour
and
sweetness
to
enjoy
a
nice
winter
offereing
and
a
great
addition
of
the
blueberry
to
a
american
stout
will
enjoy
annually
o
excellent
beer
from
dark
horse
delicious
stout
with
just
enough
blueberry
to
really
push
it
over
the
edge
overall
it
is
pleasing
but
not
perfect
it
certainly
is
an
upper
tier
blueberry
stout
an
indefinite
linger
of
roast
and
fruit
extend
well
into
the
next
sip
but
resists
the
malty
textures
that
would
accompany
it
tres
is
a
fantastic
stout
thats
been
dress
rehearsed
in
blueberry
dress
clothes
o
i
expected
more
blueberry
but
i
think
my
brother
had
aged
this
a
bit
would
like
to
try
a
fresh
one
might
try
at
brewpub
to
see
if
the
aging
diminished
the
fruit
i
expected
more
from
my
initial
impressions
but
this
one
didnt
stick
to
my
tongue
long
enough
to
taste
all
that
delicious
blueberry
i
was
smelling
a
little
coffee
on
the
back
this
might
be
a
better
stout
for
a
warm
day
it
didnt
hit
the
spot
tonight
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
opaque
brown
that
seemed
to
have
a
very
slight
bluish
purple
tinge
to
it
had
a
1
finger
mocha
brown
head
that
was
all
little
bubbles
over
time
it
flattened
out
and
became
a
bit
creamer
with
just
a
bit
of
hold
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
had
an
initial
hint
of
blueberry
but
shifted
to
a
more
of
a
roasted
dark
chocolate
smell
a
bit
of
fruity
reminded
hiding
in
the
back
flavor
was
more
a
mild
chocolate
that
shifted
to
a
definite
blueberry
pie
filling
a
bit
of
blueberry
lingered
afterwards
coated
nicely
in
mouth
a
bit
of
cling
to
the
sides
with
a
nice
chew
overall
exactly
as
it
should
be
well
balanced
stout
with
a
flavor
profile
that
hit
the
name
dead
on
overall
i
didnt
like
the
blueberry
and
floral
tastes
i
was
getting
in
this
one
didnt
go
very
well
with
the
base
beer
for
me
overall
a
nice
addition
to
the
numerical
order
of
dark
horse
stouts
got
to
go
find
me
some
fore
next
such
an
enjoyable
stout
and
the
blueberry
really
didnt
kill
the
beer
and
let
all
the
other
characteristics
stand
out
do
an
enjoyable
unique
niche
beer
but
the
blueberry
is
out
of
balance
and
makes
this
not
terribly
drinkable
for
me
fun
on
an
occassion
but
not
something
id
want
by
the
keg
pours
a
used
motor
oil
black
with
a
tiny
khaki
head
smells
of
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
blueberry
tastes
like
blueberry
pancakes
with
maple
syrup
and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
and
chewy
for
a
low
abv
stout
and
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
as
it
should
be
overall
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
brew
didnt
think
i
would
like
it
much
but
it
turned
out
to
be
awesome
my
pour
resulted
in
twoplus
fingers
of
thick
deepbrown
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
stygian
dense
dark
brown
that
allowed
for
zero
light
penetration
nose
was
indeed
tres
blueberry
redolent
with
blueberries
in
fact
how
can
you
go
wrong
with
blueberries
they
are
full
of
antioxidants
and
i
like
to
pop
a
handful
in
my
mouth
and
bite
down
for
an
explosion
of
blueberries
that
is
what
this
tasted
like
along
with
a
slight
coffeelike
bitterness
wow
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
if
it
could
have
been
just
a
little
creamier
i
would
have
been
heavensent
finish
lingered
with
the
taste
of
blueberry
and
i
was
thankful
that
i
followed
someone
elses
suggestion
o
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
for
me
i
never
had
a
blueberry
stout
much
less
heard
of
one
it
matches
all
the
characteristics
of
a
stout
with
blueberry
added
some
will
like
it
some
wont
for
me
it
gets
a
solid
thumb
up
for
innovation
and
quality
md
smooth
for
its
flavor
punch
yet
with
chewy
elements
and
surprisingly
drinklable
this
amazing
beer
has
quite
a
layered
flavor
that
demands
some
attention
if
youre
not
paying
attention
while
you
sip
this
brew
you
will
after
that
first
sip
nothing
really
extraordinary
here
though
the
blueberry
component
is
a
nice
touch
but
for
a
relatively
low
alcohol
stout
this
beer
is
pretty
nice
o
a
nice
combination
paired
it
with
a
ben
and
jerrys
yogurt
too
good
stuff
a
nice
specialty
stout
and
fairly
well
done
but
i
see
no
need
to
revisit
a
blueberry
stout
an
interesting
beer
to
be
sure
and
i
now
know
why
the
reviews
are
so
mixed
you
either
like
a
strong
roast
presence
or
you
dont
i
usually
do
but
the
interpretation
of
burnt
toast
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
o
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
the
blueberry
factor
but
this
was
really
very
good
i
would
gladly
recommend
this
beer
o
this
one
sounded
interesting
so
i
picked
it
up
as
a
single
during
a
trip
to
indiana
this
is
certainly
not
your
typical
blueberry
beer
more
flavorful
and
complex
than
just
a
stout
with
blueberry
added
a
little
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
but
i
enjoyed
it
drank
on
462012
exactly
what
a
fruit
beer
should
be
a
good
base
beer
with
a
real
nonextract
tasting
fruit
flavor
while
i
question
pairing
a
stout
with
blueberry
i
cant
question
the
execution
oh
the
taste
thick
malt
flavor
roasted
malt
and
leather
come
to
mind
the
blueberries
area
very
nice
addition
to
what
be
a
nice
thick
stout
drinkable
overall
incredible
beer
such
a
unique
offering
and
theres
nothing
to
not
like
here
dark
horse
continues
to
outperform
o
the
scent
is
good
in
the
blueberry
department
but
really
a
pretty
average
or
just
above
stout
all
around
o
a
good
beer
overall
that
smells
great
but
unfortunately
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
id
like
more
complexity
from
the
roasted
malts
and
a
stronger
blueberry
presence
thanks
matt
capones
overall
drank
this
beer
a
few
different
time
and
did
not
like
it
i
revisited
this
beer
and
i
am
glad
that
i
did
its
really
an
outstanding
stout
i
think
that
i
will
be
revisiting
one
two
and
four
as
i
have
drank
them
but
never
reviewed
them
i
am
really
impressed
by
this
beer
solid
solid
stout
they
used
blueberries
perfectly
in
this
dark
beer
this
is
first
and
foremost
a
stout
the
blueberry
is
definitely
a
spice
in
this
beer
i
think
it
enhances
the
flavor
pleasantly
theres
a
subtle
sweetness
to
this
beer
yet
it
is
not
sweet
enough
to
be
a
sweet
stout
nor
can
it
be
described
as
a
dry
stout
its
like
a
blend
the
finish
and
aftertaste
has
the
blueberry
show
up
one
last
time
tastes
very
berries
and
chocolate
smooth
and
sweet
but
almost
to
a
fault
seems
almost
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
this
is
still
inarguably
a
fine
blueberry
stout
melding
the
berry
tones
with
a
traditional
smooth
stout
o
blueberry
comes
on
a
bit
strong
but
i
actually
didnt
mind
that
as
much
the
beer
underneath
is
still
allowed
to
come
through
the
lack
of
body
is
really
what
took
this
one
down
a
notch
or
two
for
me
poor
head
retention
too
it
would
probably
be
nice
in
a
pie
crust
served
in
a
nonic
a
rich
obsidian
black
with
a
halfinch
of
creamy
mocha
head
that
domed
precariously
over
the
rim
of
the
glass
moderate
retention
and
lacing
aroma
heavy
with
dark
roasty
malts
and
a
distinctive
scent
of
freshbaked
blueberry
muffins
i
know
how
hard
it
is
to
successfully
meld
fruit
with
the
dark
malts
of
a
rich
stout
and
get
a
satisfying
result
but
i
think
dark
horse
really
nailed
it
with
this
one
very
roasty
on
the
tongue
lots
of
dark
malts
notes
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
and
an
ubiquitous
presence
of
fresh
blueberries
well
it
delivered
what
it
promised
good
balance
heaviermedium
body
nice
flavor
and
quite
drinkable
overall
again
i
want
more
cant
imagine
itd
be
quite
as
good
if
not
fresh
though
received
in
trade
from
barak316
thanks
for
the
opportunity
a
vigorous
pour
produces
jet
black
body
with
tight
tan
head
that
looks
like
poetry
in
a
glass
it
smells
like
blueberry
muffins
as
soon
as
i
pop
the
cap
roasty
herbal
earthy
aromas
as
well
as
some
berries
upon
closer
sniffing
taste
is
herbal
and
earthy
up
front
to
the
point
of
being
annoying
that
slowly
fades
into
a
burnt
sugar
roasted
kind
of
thing
long
lingering
caramel
roasty
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
heat
in
the
finish
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
rough
sticky
mouthfeel
this
kind
of
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
but
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
this
for
me
was
very
similar
to
the
two
with
the
addition
of
blueberry
flavoring
overall
a
great
stout
from
dark
horse
sweet
and
bitter
with
great
roasted
taste

with
a

fairly
dense
tan
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
some
decent
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
big
dark
chocolate
blueberry
roasted
malt
caramel
coffee
and
a
bit
of
smokiness
fantastic
aromas
smells
very
much
like
fresh
blueberries
very
authentic
taste
of
dark
chocolate
roasted

blueberry
coffee
caramel
toast
and
light
herbal

fair
amount
of
coffee
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
chocolate
blueberry
coffee
roasted
malt
and
caramel
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
great
balance
of
flavors
very
nice
showcase
of
the
blueberry
and
roasted
chocolate
notes
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
very
nice
highly
creamy
and
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
at
7
with
only
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
present
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
stout
probably
the
best
i
have
had
with
fruit
in
it
great
balance
and
big
robust
flavors
with
very
smooth
drinking
for
the
alcohol
level
overall
i
like
blueberry
stouts
the
roasted
malt
works
well
with
the
blueberry
sweetness
the
smell
on
this
one
is
very
good
and
the
taste
just
about
matches
it
another
fine
beer
from
dark
horse
overall
an
excellent
blend
of
sweet
stout
and
blueberries
a
fun
beer
but
not
one
that
i
can
have
more
than
2
of
in
one
sitting
was
hoping
for
more
of
the
sweetness
in
the
aromas
to
carry
thru
into
the
flavor
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
blueberry
stout
option
but
this
one
stands
tall
among
the
ones
that
ive
had
couldve
used
something
a
hoppy
character
higher
malt
bitterness
level
more
roastiness
more
of
a
fresh
fruit
character
still
a
quality
offering
from
dark
horse
overall
i
drank
this
for
dessert
with
some
85
dark
chocolate
and
let
me
tell
you
heavenly
the
beer
itself
is
unfreakingbelievably
delicious
if
you
like
fruity
sweet
beers
i
usually
dont
but
this
one
is
so
well
crafted
overall
this
stout
came
from
the
have
to
try
this
once
category
to
the
need
to
get
some
more
category
i
tried
this
out
of
morbid
curiosity
yet
im
loving
what
theyve
done
with
the
brew
im
pretty
convinced
that
dark
horse
could
make
just
about
anything
tasteful
now

95
for
a
12
oz
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
o
a
pretty
good
sweet
stout
overall
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
wish
i
had
more
to
share
with
more
friends
ive
been
drinking
my
way
through
dark
horses
numbered
stouts
this
one
is
definitely
the
best
so
far
the
blueberry
works
really
well
with
the
dark
roasted
malts
so
well
that
im
surprised
more
brewers
dont
do
this
an
excellent
beer
imo
overall
this
is
not
as
amazing
as
i
remember
in
the
bottle
when
i
first
sampled
last
year
this
is
much
more
roasted
and
smokey
than
i
remember
and
i
prefer
the
lighter
coffee
and
chocolate
from
the
bottled
version
than
this
thick
roasted
acrid
example
this
did
not
resonate
with
me
the
smell
was
very
offputting
o
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
besides
blueberries
of
course
and
came
out
very
satisfied
id
definitely
like
to
drink
one
again
sometime
overall
this
is
pleasant
as
a
fruity
stout
i
have
tried
various
efforts
towards
this
concept
with
no
avail
this
is
pretty
damn
nice
overall
a
nice
fruit
addition
on
a
decent
stout
the
flavors
play
well
together
and
give
it
an
interesting
appeal
fruit
gets
a
little
much
toward
the
end
of
the
bottle
overall
good
stuff
a
flavor
i
wouldnt
expect
to
go
well
the
stout
tames
a
dominant
blueberry
flavor
nicely
and
i
dont
feel
like
im
drinking
a
fruit
beer
i
could
use
a
couple
more
of
these
well
considering
this
was
an
extra
sent
to
me
2x
im
assuming
a
lot
of
people
feel
the
same
way
about
this
beer
its
a
tremendous
fruitstout
hybrid
and
is
definitely
worth
tryingsharing
o
well
done
not
overly
blueberry
at
all
it
really
works
well
in
this
stout
pretty
good
drinkability
too
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
tastedark
roasted
malt
coffeesubtle
yet
substantial
bluberry
that
provides
a
nice
counterpoint
to
the
roasted
malt
very
well
balanced
great
depth
and
character
smooth
abv
not
evident
great
stout
all
in
all
though
i
dug
tres
blueberry
its
always
a
pleasure
to
imbibe
dark
horses
stouty
concoctions
this
being
no
exception
recommended
black
with
a
coffeeandcream
colored
head
that
crackles
while
it
shrinks
to
a
collar
nose
is
blueberry
at
first
whiff
but
after
a
couple
passes
it
definitely
is
multidimensional
layers
of
coffee
roast
chocolate
blueberry
pancake
and
a
touch
of
smoke
reveal
themselves
as
well
as
a
hint
of
proper
oldschool
style
vinousness
that
seems
to
be
amped
up
by
the
berry
flavor
a
bit
and
the
taste
reveals
even
more
layers
on
the
palate
its
almost
like
the
blueberry
is
meant
to
be
there
all
the
proper
stout
flavors
are
at
play
and
they
all
seem
to
be
elevated
by
the
blueberry
as
well
as
the
blueberry
being
elevated
by
them
this
is
surprisingly
delicious
full
body
with
a
good
tingle
from
carbonation
berry
throughout
while
chocolate
a
little
smoke
and
coffee
sing
in
the
finish
hint
of
warmth
at
the
back
end
also
one
of
the
best
uses
of
fruit
in
a
stout
that
i
have
experienced
ive
had
a
couple
blueberry
stouts
before
and
i
didnt
enjoy
them
i
figured
if
i
didnt
enjoy
a
blueberry
stout
from
dark
horse
who
can
make
one
id
enjoy
if
youve
had
a
blueberry
stout
before
and
enjoyed
it
then
id
definitely
recommend
this
one
you
cant
really
ask
for
much
more
i
just
dont
appreciate
the
flavors
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
an
interesting
stout
the
blueberry
is
definitely
there
but
not
overpowering
its
just
right
along
with
the
blueberry
is
a
very
good
stout
slightly
high
as
far
as
alcohol
goes
but
the
flavors
are
really
very
good
and
balanced
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
delivers
nice
blueberry
flavor
without
being
overwhelming
by
far
one
of
the
better
blueberry
infused
beers
out
there
imho
fixing
the
mouthfeel
would
go
a
long
ways
on
this
one
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
every
year
during
darkhorses
five
stout
winter
release
its
a
relatively
smooth
beer
with
a
great
finish
i
personally
think
the
smell
is
great
but
would
prefer
even
more
fruit
taste
im
glad
i
tried
this
and
would
have
it
again
o
interesting
very
unique
and
it
changed
a
lot
depending
on
the
temperature
of
the
beer
a
lot
going
on
but
it
wasnt
all
balanced
still
good
but
not
dark
horses
most
impressive
beer
bb
beer
overall
its
a
smelling
blueberry
cigar
dipped
in
a
big
roasty
malty
stout
absolutley
love
this
even
if
it
doesnt
taste
like
blueberry
fantastic
beer
pours
a
nearly
pitch
black
with
a
big
fluffy
tan
head
and
some
minor
lacing
its
one
of
the
most
substantial
heads
ive
seen
on
a
stout
but
thats
maybe
because
im
used
to
drinking
high
abv
stouts
smell
is
fantastic
smells
like
blueberry
muffins
and
roasty
stoutness
combined
together
and
it
seems
like
theres
something
somewhat
spicy
lingering
there
as
well
taste
isnt
quite
as
impressive
as
the
flavor
but
its
still
quite
nice
blueberries
and
roast
are
the
primary
flavors
neither
overwhelms
and
theyre
pretty
balanced
but
i
almost
wish
that
there
was
more
blueberry
here
theres
also
some
breadiness
in
there
and
some
interesting
spice
that
doesnt
seem
to
fit
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
the
style
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
almost
is
great
but
falls
a
little
bit
short
odd
but
tasty
would
be
a
good
conversation
piece
for
a
tasting
definitely
try
o
pretty
stinking
good
but
the
after
taste
isnt
that
great
o
disappointing
i
was
excited
about
trying
this
too
much
blueberry
and
not
enough
stout
this
beer
starts
out
like
every
other
stout
dark
brownblack
body
half
inch
of
brown
head
that
quickly
settles
to
a
little
skim
on
top
smell
is
where
this
starts
to
set
its
self
apart
from
the
others
at
first
there
is
a
strong
blueberry
smell
with
a
burnt
coffee
and
smokey
over
cooked
bacon
the
all
of
these
smels
together
remind
me
of
the
cheap
gas
station
breakfast
where
a
pancake
is
wrapped
around
other
garbage
while
i
have
never
ate
that
stuff
from
the
gas
station
i
imagine
it
would
taste
like
this
and
that
is
not
good
dont
know
that
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
series
so
far
even
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
fruit
in
beer
i
think
you
would
enjoy
this
one
the
blueberry
is
definitely
there
but
in
a
subtle
and
unexpected
way
a
bit
to
much
roast
and
burnt
toast
for
my
liking
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruity
stouts
but
i
would
like
some
more
sweetnessfruit
flavors
to
balance
out
the
acrid
burnt
stout
even
though
i
did
like
it
very
much
it
could
be
even
better
with
less
aggressive
carbonation
and
a
more
oily
liquid
in
my
opinion
at
least
o
i
liked
this
more
than
i
was
expecting
to
for
a
fruit
complemented
stout
dark
horse
makes
some
very
good
stouts
and
this
is
no
exception
overall
this
is
a
solid
stout
and
a
nice
sweet
compliment
to
the
style
definitely
a
dessert
beer
perfect
about
this
time
of
year
o
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
wonderful
all
of
the
scents
and
flavors
are
spot
on
great
work
by
dark
horse
for
perfecting
a
blueberry
stout
o
good
stout
different
flavor
profile
this
pours
out
as
a
deep
black
color
with
a
brown
colored
head
on
top
the
head
has
a
good
retention
to
it
and
the
lacing
is
a
little
sticky
too
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
not
really
all
that
great
its
too
acidic
i
think
it
makes
the
beer
smell
a
little
like
puke
there
is
a
hint
of
blueberry
on
the
nose
but
not
enough
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
quite
nice
plenty
of
blueberry
flavors
with
some
heavy
roasted
malts
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
heavy
and
creamy
overall
it
was
a
good
brew
but
the
smell
just
turns
me
off
a
little
overall
this
beer
was
good
and
very
drinkable
there
was
some
acidity
to
it
however
on
the
stomach
this
is
my
first
stout
that
has
a
fruit
added
i
like
the
sweetness
the
fruit
brings
i
will
have
to
look
for
more
fruit
flavored
stouts
after
finding
this
one
hoping
to
work
my
way
through
all
five
of
these
stouts
this
year
for
some
reason
i
decided
to
start
here
with
number
three
go
figure
it
pours
a
straight
onyx
topped
by
a
finger
of
darkly
sienna
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
dank
blueberries
and
some
molasses
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
the
conflict
between
the
dark
chocolatebitter
roasted
malts
and
the
blueberries
is
apparent
from
the
getgo
it
ends
up
coming
off
as
too
bitter
too
pithy
sort
of
for
me
the
body
is
lightly
hefty
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nearly
chewy
feel
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
flavors
involved
just
dont
seem
to
mesh
entirely
well
i
can
drink
it
just
not
very
easily
and
without
complete
enjoyment
close
though
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
aasher
for
this
one
third
in
the
series
and
third
on
the
day
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
right
before
it
was
murdered
by
my
friend
poured
pitch
black
with
a
half
finger
light
brown
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
blueberries
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
blueberries
and
subtle
dark
chocolate
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
blueberry
stout
you
say
hmmm
might
as
well
since
i
have
the
rest
of
the
series
to
get
through
today
doesnt
smell
too
bad
but
you
can
definitely
tell
this
thing
has
blueberries
in
it
without
a
doubt
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
typical
american
stout
based
brew
with
a
touch
of
blueberry
that
comes
throughout
the
sip
and
after
swallowing
still
not
sure
how
i
personally
feel
about
fruit
infused
stouts
but
this
one
is
at
least
a
good
start
my
all
time
favorite
fruit
beer
this
is
2
things
a
very
well
composed
fruit
beer
and
an
excellent
stout
both
separately
you
can
disect
both
flavors
in
your
mouth
very
easily
this
is
the
best
example
of
a
hint
of
fruit
i
have
ever
had
in
a
beer
you
get
a
very
roasty
smoky
deliscious
stout
up
front
with
the
perfect
small
amount
of
blueberry
in
the
back
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
thick
dark
brown
color
with
a
sticky
mocha
tan
head
that
slowly
settles
some
lace
left
as
the
head
calms
dark
chocolate
notes
with
an
almost
pepper
like
hint
as
well
for
only
7
is
smells
a
touch
boozy
as
well
light
blueberry
flavor
in
the
beginning
that
is
quickly
dominated
by
a
growing
leather
and
roast
flavor
a
couple
of
sips
of
this
pretty
much
told
me
exactly
what
kind
a
beer
this
was
lingering
roast
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
meh
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
nice
look
but
the
aroma
and
smell
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
o
a
good
stout
being
they
went
out
on
a
limb
with
the
blueberries
its
a
little
off
at
first
but
grows
on
you
the
roasty
finish
is
awesome
from
the
beginning
the
aroma
harkens
back
to
the
childhood
cereal
with
the
blue
ghost
known
as
boo
berry
the
malts
in
the
aroma
combines
with
the
scents
of
blueberry
make
for
an
interesting
combination
the
appearance
shows
a
dark
murky
brown
with
little
head
after
the
pour
no
forced
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
the
creaminess
of
the
lactose
reinforces
the
cereal
theme
nicely
the
sweet
malt
flavors
really
stand
out
in
the
initial
taste
this
is
no
macrobrew
stout
the
sweetness
and
the
blueberry
hints
make
an
easy
drink
the
blueberry
is
not
overpowering
in
the
taste
if
the
fruit
were
more
potent
one
might
forget
heshe
was
drinking
beer
the
sweet
malt
fades
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
ending
the
pleasant
experience
overall
kind
of
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
will
have
to
pick
up
another
four
pack
when
they
release
it
this
winter
and
can
only
hope
i
do
not
have
the
same
experience
i
did
not
even
finish
my
glass
oexcellent
id
gladly
have
this
one
again
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
didnt
think
would
be
pulled
off
everything
works
together
in
near
perfect
harmony
to
achieve
everything
i
would
ever
want
in
a
blueberry
stout
not
an
everyday
drinker
but
a
nice
treat
for
sure
a
tasty
brew
from
a
quality
brewery
o
all
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
in
this
beer
go
well
together
the
amount
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
make
it
feel
lighter
than
most
heavy
stouts
do
this
is
the
last
of
the
stout
series
for
me
and
this
one
pours
just
like
the
rest
pitch
black
with
a
bubbly
mocha
head
that
dissipates
to
a
ring
there
is
little
lacing
but
lots
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
middle
throughout
aroma
is
surprising
for
a
stout
it
smells
like
a
blueberry
cobbler
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
thrown
in
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
nice
as
the
aroma
but
still
good
with
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
bittersweet
chocolates
dominating
the
blueberries
are
present
but
not
overwhelming
making
for
a
nice
balanced
flavor
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
tons
of
carbonation
odd
for
a
stout
this
is
right
up
there
with
plead
the
5th
in
the
series
great
beer
and
the
best
sessionable
stout
ive
tasted
in
a
while
i
shared
this
1
but
i
will
buy
more
o
actually
really
not
bad
i
think
it
does
a
lot
to
capture
blueberry
character
and
maintains
it
throughout
smell
and
taste
im
not
sure
it
takes
it
to
a
level
of
deliciousness
that
really
makes
it
worth
reaching
for
though
would
like
to
try
this
again
on
tap
o
ive
noticed
that
the
blueberry
comes
out
a
long
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
up
but
never
in
an
obtrusive
way
i
was
quite
surprised
how
well
the
blueberry
works
within
the
framework
of
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
grains
soft
on
the
palate
and
easy
to
drink
its
a
stout
i
probably
wouldnt
even
turn
down
in
the
heat
of
july
i
think
this
is
a
impressive
beer
it
has
some
flavors
that
normally
would
be
the
end
of
a
stout
to
me
but
rounds
them
out
with
a
lot
of
interesting
angles
to
the
taste
it
really
keeps
you
sipping
to
continue
to
get
all
those
subtle
hints
on
a
nice
side
note
when
you
burp
it
tastes
like
blueberry
pancakes
i
cant
wait
to
share
this
beer
with
a
few
friends
do
in
celebration
for
purchasing
my
third
ha
car
enjoyed
this
one
especially
how
it
felt
in
my
mouth
although
the
blueberry
aspect
was
lacking
it
seemed
thanks
mammothbrew
poured
into
a
goblet
the
beer
appears
as
a
deep
mocha
brown
bordering
black
held
up
to
the
light
with
a
nice
coffee
head
smell
on
this
one
was
great
blueberry
was
very
pronounced
for
me
up
front
with
some
roast
coffee
in
the
background
in
the
smell
i
felt
like
i
was
sitting
down
to
some
blueberry
pancakes
with
a
cup
of
coffee
at
the
ready
taste
did
not
deliver
quite
the
overwhelming
blueberry
flavor
that
i
picked
up
on
it
the
aroma
but
it
was
still
present
some
standard
roast
malt
and
chocolate
was
present
as
well
not
the
thickest
stout
by
any
means
but
a
nice
medium
profile
in
mouthfeel
which
almost
seemed
more
appropriate
since
its
a
fruit
stout
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
could
see
picking
up
a
four
pack
each
year
on
its
release
to
have
something
different
available
o
i
love
dark
horse
but
this
beer
is
less
than
i
was
hoping
for
a
decent
stout
but
lacking
as
a
fruit
stout
imho
322011
this
stout
has
a
moderate
malt
sweetness
on
entry
with
mild
bitter
tinge
and
sweet
element
of
blueberry
the
blueberry
tastes
like
natural
fruit
not
extract
with
elements
of
spice
from
the
hops
and
gentle
bitter
tinges
the
caramel
and
dark
malt
flavors
form
a
solid
base
for
the
blueberry
to
be
supported
by
with
mild
toastiness
and
semidry
flavor
as
it
finishes
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
think
it
has
just
enough
blueberry
without
going
overboard
and
losing
sight
of
the
base
stout
i
am
a
fan
of
blueberry
so
i
could
probably
enjoy
it
in
any
style
as
long
as
it
is
done
well
i
think
dark
horse
did
a
great
job
of
combining
the
two
flavors
as
an
american
stout
lover
this
is
one
of
the
best
perfect
dark
head
on
this
one
with
the
rolling
bubbles
that
suggest
perfect
carbonation
dark
as
hell
the
nose
is
beautiful
with
a
touch
of
fresh
blueberries
not
some
sweetened
blueberry
flavoring
and
that
is
the
key
for
this
beer
it
has
a
subtle
flavor
of
blueberry
that
backs
off
with
age
it
is
not
overshadowing
the
important
qualities
and
characters
of
a
dry
stout
i
highly
recommend
this
one
for
all
beer
lovers
i
would
love
to
find
this
guy
on
tap
as
well
especially
nitro
o
pretty
good
fruit
stout
the
first
ive
ever
had
for
sure
even
if
you
think
its
odd
its
definitely
worth
a
shot
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
its
definitely
my
favorite
from
this
series
so
far
o
wow
what
a
unique
brew
this
one
is
like
no
other
ive
ever
had
hands
down
one
of
the
more
amazing
fruit
brews
ive
ever
had
i
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
brew
come
my
way
in
the
future
thank
you
andyavalanche
for
an
awesome
ship
i
never
would
have
thought
to
put
blueberries
in
a
stout
but
dark
horse
did
a
great
job
with
this
brew
truly
unique
o
by
far
the
best
use
of
blueberry
ive
had
in
a
beer
to
date
i
really
hate
smoke
but
i
think
in
this
case
the
smoke
and
heavy
roast
helps
the
beer
from
being
too
sweet
o
i
usually
opt
out
to
beers
infused
with
fruits
that
arent
lambics
or
what
have
you
but
this
was
an
exceptional
treat
never
would
have
thought
that
the
malt
base
would
do
so
well
with
the
blueberries
really
a
treat
in
a
glass
i
wish
i
had
some
muffins
to
accompany
this
beer
o
very
impressed
with
this
beer
great
job
of
creating
a
beer
with
a
huge
blueberry
aroma
without
an
overwhelming
blueberry
taste
skeptical
at
first
but
would
certainly
buy
this
beer
again
all
in
all
a
top
notch
american
stout
and
it
shows
what
american
brewers
can
do
with
nontraditional
ingredients
a
winner
blueberries
on
the
nose
allthough
my
wife
swears
she
smells
only
black
licorice
and
tastes
only
black
licorice
taste
is
all
blueberry
up
front
to
me
coffee
after
ive
swallowed
the
after
taste
is
better
for
me
then
the
in
my
mouth
taste
the
taste
transition
from
blueberry
to
coffee
is
pretty
cool
though
very
different
much
sweeter
than
i
like
from
a
stout
something
that
any
stout
lover
should
try
at
least
once
based
purely
upon
the
peculiararity
of
it
allthough
once
was
enough
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
high
overall
it
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
the
blueberries
really
worked
well
for
it
i
especially
liked
how
they
interacted
with
the
bitter
roasty
flavors
definitely
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
overall
and
one
of
the
better
fruit
stouts
ive
had
up
for
review
is
a
bottle
of
tres
from
dark
horse
enjoyed
at
room
temp
in
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
black
with
an
espresso
head
a
sweet
milky
stout
with
some
artificial
blueberry
body
drinks
well
lacks
complexity
not
bad
but
nothing
great
either
this
is
drinkable
but
the
blueberry
flavor
seems
a
bit
artificial
its
not
a
complex
stout
but
if
you
like
blueberry
muffins
youll
like
this
one
pours
a
thick
opaque
black
with
a
nice
2
inch
dark
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
thick
frothy
lace
that
drips
back
down
into
the
beer
on
the
drink
down
smells
exactly
like
chocolate
covered
blueberries
awesome
taste
is
pure
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
covered
dried
blueberries
a
very
complex
balance
between
the
roasted
and
chocolate
flavors
and
the
blueberry
an
almost
perfect
level
of
carbonation
leaves
this
beer
feeling
very
crisp
yet
smooth
and
creamy
overall
this
is
a
shockingly
exceptional
beer
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
way
different
with
a
fake
tasting
fruit
flavor
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
long
without
getting
tired
of
it
especially
at
the
4
5
abv
it
has
i
am
super
glad
i
have
2
more
bottles
of
this
in
my
cellar
to
enjoy
at
a
later
time
o
i
love
almost
everything
about
this
beer
it
looks
great
it
smells
great
and
is
creamy
and
thick
the
taste
could
use
a
tweaking
to
make
this
a
phenomenal
beer
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
stout
i
really
did
not
think
that
a
blueberry
stout
would
be
something
that
would
interest
me
that
much
but
this
beer
turned
out
to
be
well
made
and
has
some
very
nice
flavors
this
is
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
i
definitely
recommend
you
pick
up
some
and
try
it
for
yourself
i
bought
this
beer
a
couple
of
times
over
a
year
ago
and
would
love
to
find
it
again
its
a
nice
combination
of
a
very
dry
and
bitter
stout
with
the
perceived
aromatic
sweetness
of
blueberries
making
for
a
phenomenal
balance
i
usually
prefer
a
hefty
stout
with
twice
the
alcohol
but
this
was
just
as
satisfying
im
glad
to
see
it
get
good
ratings
since
the
blueberry
thing
might
pigeonhole
it
with
some
people
as
somewhat
of
a
novelty
and
i
didnt
even
think
of
myself
as
much
of
a
blueberry
fan
before
trying
it
o
this
is
a
nice
sweet
treat
certainly
unique
and
fairly
well
crafted
this
is
a
beer
that
id
pick
up
from
time
to
time
if
i
saw
it
it
would
be
nice
to
keep
on
hand
this
beer
pours
a
color
of
pitch
black
night
no
hint
of
anything
but
black
not
much
head
to
speak
of
maybe
a
tight
layer
at
the
rim
not
overtly
carbonated
but
that
was
ok
because
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
terrible
viscous
thought
it
could
have
used
some
more
carbonation
and
heavier
mouthfeel
the
nose
is
wonderful
blueberry
not
much
more
than
that
with
a
hint
of
caramel
maltiness
not
as
much
blueberry
on
the
taste
kind
of
not
loving
the
flavor
as
much
as
the
nose
the
malty
roasty
flavors
i
like
in
a
stout
arent
really
prevalent
overall
good
beer
glad
i
tried
it
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
a
relatively
light
wellrefined
stout
that
matches
well
with
pastries
of
all
forms
dare
i
suggest
one
for
breakfast
i
wish
the
flavor
had
followed
through
from
the
aroma
i
could
use
more
berries
decent
but
not
as
good
as
it
could
be
im
midway
through
my
backwards
through
the
dark
horse
stout
series
and
im
a
big
fan
of
each
one
ive
had
so
far
theyve
definitely
been
in
the
same
family
but
more
like
cousins
than
brothers
a
great
series
from
a
brewery
i
havent
been
wild
about
until
now
overall
a
good
stout
to
revert
to
every
now
and
again
not
much
of
a
session
stout
though
cheers
o
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
thought
there
was
some
real
potential
in
adding
a
hint
of
blueberries
to
a
stout
but
in
the
end
the
fruit
was
a
bit
to
dominant
for
me
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
it
tasted
just
as
good
as
it
did
a
year
ago
this
beer
had
some
complexity
to
it
and
had
great
balance
between
roasty
stout
flavors
and
freshly
picked
blueberrys
i
thought
the
combination
of
blueberrys
worked
really
well
with
this
beer
it
really
makes
it
stick
out
from
all
the
other
stouts
on
the
market
one
whiff
of
this
and
you
know
its
not
your
average
stout
i
am
going
to
have
to
go
back
to
the
store
and
grab
another
four
pack
before
this
beer
disappears
till
next
year
if
you
like
your
stouts
with
a
twist
and
are
looking
for
a
fruit
stout
done
right
look
no
further
this
one
is
on
point
i
find
a
lot
of
fruit
infused
stouts
dont
turn
out
that
good
and
taste
artificial
well
this
one
doesnt
dark
horse
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
brew
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
the
their
stout
series
dont
pass
this
one
up
pours
a
dark
thick
color
with
a
finger
or
so
of
thick
dark
foam
that
lingers
the
blueberries
come
through
best
on
the
nose
on
top
of
the
large
roasted
scent
of
the
barley
only
a
hint
of
blueberry
comes
through
in
the
flavor
profile
but
it
is
there
especially
lingering
at
the
end
between
sips
the
main
flavor
is
of
a
robust
roasted
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
thick
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
pretty
darn
tasty
drink
and
the
low
abv
lends
itself
to
being
a
good
session
beer
o
i
am
pretty
impressed
with
this
i
really
like
the
way
the
blueberries
play
with
the
chocolate
and
roast
and
at
only
4
5
i
could
have
a
few
of
em
reccomended
skal
o
started
off
well
but
i
was
expecting
more
blueberry
pretty
standard
stout
but
i
was
surprised
how
much
flavor
they
packed
in
for
such
a
small
abv
o
a
nice
take
on
a
blueberry
beer
this
one
shows
a
lot
of
promise
at
the
beginning
and
middle
but
starts
to
fall
apart
a
bit
towards
the
end
finish
is
too
sweet
and
leaves
a
filmy
powdery
feel
right
at
the
end
nice
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
but
could
also
use
a
little
work
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
medium
brown
head
very
nice
looking
beer
scent
is
very
unique
strong
blueberries
up
front
followed
by
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
a
lot
more
delicious
than
i
was
expecting
great
blueberry
flavor
followed
by
coffee
and
dark
fruits
then
some
chocolate
and
roasted
flavors
finishes
with
more
blueberry
there
is
strong
sweetness
throughout
so
much
flavor
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
for
a
stout
not
to
thin
and
not
overly
thick
like
an
imperial
stout
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
not
compare
to
anything
else
ive
ever
had
extremely
genuine
and
delicious
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
for
the
style
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
making
for
a
fizzyodd
mouthfeel
im
in
the
minority
here
but
i
thought
this
was
an
awful
beer
i
normally
dont
slam
a
beer
like
this
but
it
tastes
like
blueberry
soda
mixed
with
bad
coffee
m
and
d
sits
thicker
on
the
palate
than
expected
again
calls
to
mind
a
much
bigger
beer
than
it
actually
is
creamy
full
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
and
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
a
pleasure
to
drink
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
this
again
this
brew
and
the
others
in
the
line
are
good
but
so
burnt
tasting
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
pick
out
other
traits
when
the
roast
character
is
so
prevalent
however
at
4
5
this
one
could
easily
be
an
imperial
stout
except
that
it
doesnt
have
a
big
alcohol
character
which
helps
to
balance
the
big
roast
by
not
having
more
than
one
extreme
characteristic
for
only
being
4
5
abv
the
tres
drinks
like
a
much
bigger
stout
not
necessarily
that
there
are
overwhelming
hints
of
alcohol
but
something
seems
too
over
the
top
big
for
such
a
small
beer
i
would
revisit
for
sure
but
not
something
i
could
sit
and
drink
for
more
than
one
pint
i
have
mixed
feelings
on
this
beer
i
was
enjoying
it
with
the
exception
of
the
carbonation
so
i
tried
to
swirl
it
down
which
didnt
seem
to
help
much
a
good
swirl
brought
forth
some
off
almost
stale
aromas
and
the
flavors
seemed
in
disarray
too
im
taking
it
with
a
grain
of
salt
as
i
otherwise
enjoyed
this
beer
ive
simply
never
encountered
this
before
the
aroma
is
particularly
good
on
this
stout
there
is
a
lot
of
fresh
blueberry
aroma
along
with
nutty
chocolaty
and
yeasty
aromas
to
compliment
the
beer
pours
with
a
very
deep
black
color
and
a
head
that
stays
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
leaving
a
swirl
on
top
of
the
beer
from
the
smell
i
expected
this
to
be
very
fruity
which
in
its
own
right
it
is
however
not
in
an
alcipop
sort
of
way
the
initial
flavors
are
of
a
very
strong
and
bitter
stout
flavors
that
hit
the
tongue
right
off
the
bat
are
a
little
overwhelming
but
very
nice
to
pick
through
the
blueberry
introduces
the
beer
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
while
strong
flavors
of
wood
and
dark
roasted
coffee
take
over
the
back
of
the
tongue
gets
a
deep
almost
burnt
malt
flavor
which
dances
well
with
the
hop
bitterness
the
flavors
are
so
intense
that
it
reminds
me
of
an
imperial
stout
the
palate
is
almost
bizarre
as
the
beer
slides
across
your
tongue
but
is
somewhat
harsh
going
down
overall
this
is
absolutley
worth
a
try
or
even
a
case
d
tres
smells
tastes
and
feels
like
a
much
bigger
stout
but
without
the
alcohol
heat
while
i
didnt
get
much
blueberry
this
was
a
fine
stout
regardless

ripe
blueberries
intertwined
with
a
roasted

medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
slightly
bitter
finish
a
nice
beer
but
wish
the
blueberry
was
a
bit
stronger
still
i
like
this
this
quite
a
bit
d
very
drinkable
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
here
but
this
is
a
solid
stout
glad
to
get
a
chance
to
try
it
and
certainly
would
have
more
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
full
the
mouth
pucker
is
weird
but
not
a
killer
finish
is
drier
than
usual
for
the
style
because
of
the
fruity
character
but
thats
ok
the
beer
is
drinkable
as
well
although
not
as
drinkable
as
other
stouts
out
there
due
to
the
blueberry
effect
on
the
mouthfeel
abv
is
not
noticeable
and
finish
is
good
though
it
could
be
better
great
fruit
stout
as
there
arent
many
that
can
pull
something
like
this
off
half
pint
at
black
swan
brew
pub
plainfield
indiana
poured
a
very
nice
deep
brown
near
black
but
with
no
head
and
very
little
lacing
nice
stout
aroma
with
decent
roasted
grains
along
with
a
huge
blueberry
scent
mingles
together
nicely
decent
flavor
but
the
blueberries
almost
completely
overwell
the
stout
you
do
get
a
bit
of
nice
roasted
grains
but
mostly
its
berry
goes
down
fine
nothing
grand
nothing
bad
wish
it
has
slightly
less
blueberry
since
this
was
a
blueberry
stout
and
not
a
stout
blueberry
this
is
the
last
of
the
stout
series
i
had
yet
to
try
i
thought
too
cream
stout
was
good
but
this
is
phenomenal
jet
black
orangetan
head
robust
roasted
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
with
a
whisp
of
fresh
blueberries
flavor
is
brief
blueberry
that
explodes
into
roasted
coffee
patent
malt
toffee
brief
end
of
blueberryfruitiness
and
finishes
deep
roast
malt
bitterness
carbonation
that
bounces
flavor
off
the
taste
buds
this
is
not
a
fruit
beer
however
the
blueberry
lends
a
complexity
and
finish
like
no
other
absolute
mastery
if
you
havent
tried
the
stout
line
from
dark
horse
go
out
and
try
them
but
save
this
one
for
last
stout
that
is
extremely
and
dangerously
drinkable
thanks
to
hurfer
for
the
extra
poured
from
12oz
bottle
no
date
stamp
into
snifter
glass
pours
a
silky
black
with
a
creamy
dark
brown
head
and
a
tight
ring
of
lace
aroma
is
wonderfully
unique
with
huge
notes
of
fresh
blueberries
backed
by
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
earth
and
a
bit
of
peat
with
hints
of
coffee
and
cinnamon
oatmeal
flavor
is
great
as
well
never
tasted
anything
like
it
really
tastes
like
blueberry
spiked
coffee
with
notes
of
dark
chocolate
roast
and
dry
barley
with
a
hint
of
ash
palate
is
medium
bodied
with
solid
carbonation
and
a
dry
blueberrycoffee
finish
overall
one
of
the
most
unique
fruity
stouts
ive
tasted
deasily
drinkable
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
to
try
it
this
is
the
first
fruitstout
ive
had
and
it
is
better
than
i
expected
it
is
heavy
enough
to
only
want
one
but
id
be
happy
to
have
another
drinkability
impressive
not
a
big
fan
of
fruits
in
my
beer
but
this
one
works
very
well
a
great
beer
so
happy
to
receive
this
as
an
extra
and
will
be
looking
for
more
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
good
carbonation
level
drinkable
yes
hv
drinkability
i
really
liked
this
beer
other
than
the
after
taste
i
dont
think
id
have
more
because
of
it
i
was
quite
impressed
by
this
beer
wasnt
gimimicky
just
plain
good
surprised
by
the
amount
of
flavor
in
a
stout
comparable
to
guinness
in
terms
of
alcohol
content
great
beer
overall
a
real
nice
stout
that
is
really
different
but
really
good
the
low
alcohol
allows
you
to
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
it
with
no
worries
this
is
an
excellent
stout
that
i
will
definitely
drink
more
of
well
done
dark
horse
d
very
good
nice
combination
of
flavors
and
absolutely
delicious
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
a
bit
creamy
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
i
was
surprised
to
find
out
the
abv
on
this
beer
after
i
had
it
especially
since
the
body
was
still
full
enough
to
hold
the
beer
together
i
was
expecting
the
blueberries
to
wreck
the
flavor
but
the
chocolate
and
malt
played
nicely
with
this
it
pours
black
with
dark
brown
edges
thick
and
creamy
head
of
decent
height
the
color
of
this
topper
is
unique
as
it
is
brown
but
has
this
interesting
blue
tint
to
it
the
promised
blueberry
is
present
in
the
nose
but
blended
well
with
notes
of
bitter
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
a
dab
of
caramel
this
definitely
has
all
the
flavor
of
a
good
american
stout
the
bitter
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
is
in
there
mixed
with
a
shot
of
coffee
and
a
dab
of
blueberry
the
blueberry
takes
a
backseat
in
this
stout
which
is
nice
im
not
sure
of
the
ibus
but
there
is
a
moderate
hop
presence
but
hardly
noticeable
mediumfull
body
and
the
medium
carbonation
play
perfectly
in
the
mouth
very
very
tasty
and
low
abvs
make
this
very
very
drinkable
seek
this
out
while
its
available
i
am
getting
more
immediately
drinkability
is
moderate
as
i
cant
see
a
lot
of
faults
with
this
beer
but
also
no
stand
out
characteristics
other
then
smell
i
could
drink
this
all
night
dont
get
me
wrong
but
it
definitely
wasnt
near
the
top
of
my
favorites
pours
jet
black
with
a
chocolate
brown
head
in
the
aroma
hints
of
sweet
blueberry
and
roasty
sweet
oatmeal
in
the
taste
sweet
roasty
oatmeal
with
just
a
hint
of
blueberry
a
small
hop
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
sweet
oatmeal
in
the
aftertaste
small
blueberry
notes
but
more
oatmeal
stout
like
but
quite
nice
d
drinkability
i
rated
higher
because
decent
pricelow
abv
and
the
taste
is
really
good
d
id
classify
this
a
welldone
gimmicky
type
beer
its
something
you
want
to
try
and
enjoy
once
but
not
something
id
want
more
than
once
in
a
while
strange
but
when
thinking
of
a
food
pairing
i
keep
thinking
this
beer
would
work
great
for
breakfast
with
a
plate
of
blueberry
pancakes
pours
a
black
color
with
huge
dark
chocolate
head
that
holds
for
quite
a
while
it
looks
as
appealing
as
any
beer
ive
seen
the
smell
is
strongly
of
roasted
malt
with
slight
hint
of
chocolate
and
blueberries
the
taste
is
fruity
but
not
of
blueberry
the
stout
in
this
beer
still
shines
through
more
than
anything
else
but
its
unlike
any
other
tried
moderate
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
from
the
rich
head
that
is
still
persisting
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
solid
stout
and
a
unique
beer
its
not
one
id
pound
all
night
long
but
good
work
by
dark
horse
here
sjg
i
plead
the
fifth
d
a
nice
dessert
treat
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
this
all
night
drinkability
surprisingly
good
the
blueberry
character
is
really
fresh
and
natural
actually
i
really
like
this
possibly
more
than
one
and
too
i
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
this
regularly
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
fruitflavored
stouts
ive
ever
had
overall
i
like
how
dark
horse
worked
the
blueberry
into
this
one
this
is
one
crazy
tasting
beer
i
think
there
is
a
time
and
a
place
for
this
one
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
all
the
time
but
i
think
it
is
a
very
successful
combination
of
one
my
favorite
fruits
with
beer
the
blueberries
are
surprising
despite
the
smell
the
bitter
flavor
offsets
the
sweet
and
sour
blueberries
wonderfully
this
beer
is
full
and
heavy
in
the
mouth
with
moderate
carbonation
i
really
think
this
one
is
delicious
i
did
not
expect
to
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
do
d
fairly
drinkable
but
the
sweetness
of
the
blueberry
drops
the
drinkability
a
little
d
a
mostly
hit
or
miss
beer
across
its
individual
categories
the
blueberry
intensity
here
without
a
great
flavor
to
back
it
up
was
just
too
much
for
this
one
to
go
down
easily
at
all
d
was
impressed
by
how
creamy
and
roasty
this
beer
was
but
really
expected
more
fruit
flavor
still
if
your
looking
for
a
flavored
stout
this
one
is
perfect
harsh
yet
mildly
sweet
with
subdued
fruit
flavor
awesome
drinkability
never
would
have
guessed
that
blueberry
and
a
stout
would
go
so
well
together
just
fantastic
very
drinkable
and
delicious
to
say
the
least
drinkability
is
great
i
honestly
went
into
this
thing
thinking
that
it
would
be
tasty
enough
as
i
have
really
liked
the
few
darkhorse
brews
but
this
far
exceeded
my
expectations
its
a
great
brew
i
sure
hope
my
buddy
up
in
oh
sends
another
bottle
or
two
next
time
wink
wink
a
very
enjoyable
stout
the
flavor
is
the
highlight
of
the
beer
with
the
blueberry
mixed
in
quite
nicely
d
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
stout
i
loved
the
nose
and
really
thought
the
blueberries
came
through
in
it
i
think
the
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
muted
the
blueberries
in
the
taste
a
bit
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
would
certainly
have
again
d
at
4
5
this
is
one
of
the
best
drinking
and
looking
at
that
low
of
a
threshold
very
well
done
well
done
dark
horse
verdict
despite
being
slightly
watered
down
it
is
a
perfect
mixture
of
blueberry
taste
it
was
different
from
any
other
dark
fruit
stout
or
porter
ive
had
before
definitely
worth
checking
out
d
as
stated
above
i
didnt
feel
compelled
to
write
until
this
evening
has
a
light
viscosity
no
cloying
no
syrupysugary
sweetness
drinks
well
finishes
better
blueberry
as
stated
very
prevalent
but
in
an
encouraging
manner
certainly
going
to
give
this
another
run
well
done
dark
horse
i
loved
the
too
cream
this
was
better
congrats
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
thick
opaque
black
creamy
with
half
an
inch
or
so
of
head
smells
like
what
youd
expect
a
chocolate
covered
blueberry
to
smell
like
taste
combines
semisweet
dark
chocolate
with
light
blueberry
mouthfeel
is
light
and
wellcarbonated
theres
almost
no
alcohol
presence
here
making
for
excellent
drinkability
i
like
this
very
well
done
at
smokin
joes
this
beer
was
amazing
dark
roasted
malts
bring
out
that
dark
chocolateslight
coffee
hint
as
the
nose
opens
up
you
realize
theres
a
nice
earthy
blueberry
character
taking
hold
low
alcohol
minimalizes
interference
from
other
flavors
overall
you
take
the
first
sip
and
you
realize
dark
roasted
maltscreaminessblueberry
all
at
once
almost
overwhelming
but
excessently
awesome
version
of
a
fruit
stout
i
will
grab
a
four
pack
when
available
in
oh
but
this
version
on
tap
at
smokin
joes
was
my
beer
of
the
night
mouthfeel
was
creamy
alcohol
was
smooth
or
nonexistent
on
the
palate
excellent
version
of
a
great
beer
drinkability
overall
was
class
a
the
type
of
beer
i
want
to
experience
again
and
again
from
todays
craft
brewing
industry
you
can
just
tell
this
beer
is
labor
intensive
overall
absolutely
incredible
beer
the
blueberry
is
fresh
and
natural
almost
too
drinakble
fairly
simple
when
you
really
think
about
it
but
this
is
one
of
my
highest
rated
beers
there
is
nothing
i
can
really
knock
it
for
except
for
the
lame
label
blueberry
stout
what
for
a
long
time
i
passed
this
beer
over
for
other
ventures
my
bad
it
seems
for
this
is
a
really
good
brew
blueberries
not
overpowering
chocolate
maybe
i
dont
know
but
i
do
like
this
beer
a
new
go
to
for
me
well
done
dark
horse
this
pours
a
medium
bodied
black
with
a
one
finger
creamy
dark
khaki
head
it
looks
like
it
should
the
aromas
are
of
light
blueberry
bitter
chocolate
and
light
malty
sweetness
you
definitely
pick
up
the
blueberry
first
but
it
isnt
overpowering
by
any
means
the
flavors
too
are
blueberry
upfront
followed
by
both
sweet
and
bitter
chocolates
and
a
mild
coffee
roast
the
blueberry
presents
itself
well
here
as
well
this
beer
drinks
very
very
smoothly
and
is
overly
drinkable
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
presented
quite
well
and
get
the
blueberry
across
in
a
light
and
appealing
manner
this
is
one
of
dark
horses
better
offerings
and
worth
a
try
d
definately
drinkable
beer
i
dont
know
about
wanting
to
drink
this
all
night
but
a
few
of
these
to
enjoy
is
a
ok
to
me
would
definitely
drink
this
again
not
bad
at
all
am
i
buying
again
no
did
that
drank
that
tossed
the
bottle
d
a
bit
too
dry
to
be
very
drinkable
and
i
wish
there
was
more
blueberry
flavor
in
it
but
its
still
good
to
drink
drink
is
good
no
real
heavy
overpowering
or
off
flavors
the
blueberry
flavor
and
especially
aroma
is
a
little
heavier
than
desired
but
doesnt
really
effect
drinkability
def
sessionable
when
it
comes
to
booze
and
smoothness
drinkability
if
i
had
a
case
d
i
like
that
this
is
a
lowabv
highflavor
beer
and
really
wish
dh
would
make
this
a
year
round
brew
that
would
probably
make
it
less
special
in
the
lineup
though
drinkability
wow
i
really
like
this
beer
the
blueberry
really
goes
well
with
the
roastiness
of
the
stout
the
blueberry
tastes
natural
and
not
syrupyyet
the
beeriness
is
still
there
could
have
several
new
favorite
from
the
brewery
md
bittery
aftertaste
nice
carbonation
leaves
a
touch
of
a
tingle
but
a
dry
aftertaste
glad
i
got
a
taste
interesting
idea
just
not
executed
very
good
pass
d
wow
just
wow
i
need
to
get
some
more
of
this
infact
id
love
to
keep
this
in
the
fridge
and
have
it
year
round
there
is
great
stout
qualities
here
with
some
really
tasty
real
natural
blueberry
aromas
and
flavors
definately
need
more
of
this
d
its
an
okay
stout
i
feel
like
the
blueberry
should
have
been
more
pronounced
its
not
bad
for
a
stout
but
i
feel
like
if
you
call
it
a
blueberry
stout
you
should
be
able
to
taste
some
blueberry
t
get
some
chocolate
than
some
coffee
followed
by
some
blueberries
and
a
little
hint
of
hops
and
some
roasted
malts
the
blueberries
balance
nicely
with
the
chocolate
and
coffee
to
give
this
beer
a
nice
pleasant
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
creamy
feel
that
ends
on
the
dry
side
after
the
last
drop
is
swallowed
and
with
a
4
5
alcohol
and
not
being
too
filling
makes
this
a
nice
six
pack
to
take
to
a
party
db
alright
flavor
after
a
very
nice
aroma
the
fruit
flavor
feels
more
artificial
in
the
taste
it
doesnt
blend
very
great
with
the
huge
stout
flavors
present
drinkability
is
good
here
as
the
flavors
are
mild
enough
and
clean
enough
to
please
this
brew
could
pass
as
a
dessert
brew
although
it
could
stand
for
a
bump
in
abv
to
beef
it
up
drinks
surprisingly
well
i
was
going
to
pass
on
this
one
as
most
fruity
dark
beers
have
been
not
for
me
but
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
would
revisit
would
probably
go
well
with
certain
culinary
dishes
as
well
will
keep
that
in
mind
a
one
of
a
kind
beer
that
is
well
done
maybe
sessionable
but
the
roast
may
prevent
it
a
bit
dark
horse
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
with
beers
like
this
one
d
love
this
could
drink
many
more
i
absolutely
love
blueberries
however
this
just
didnt
agree
with
me
i
havent
had
another
blueberry
stout
to
compare
this
to
so
maybe
the
flavor
im
picking
up
on
is
simply
a
product
of
combining
roasted
malt
hops
and
tobacco
and
is
rather
typical
i
really
wish
i
had
liked
this
more
but
its
just
not
for
me
the
blueberry
flavor
is
clearly
there
not
ridiculous
like
drinking
some
weird
acaiblueberry
crap
at
your
health
club
this
beer
is
balanced
giving
you
enough
roasted
malt
and
blueberry
to
make
you
think
of
blueberry
pie
and
for
us
michiganders
blueberry
pie
at
christmas
made
from
berries
from
the
falls
harvest
is
well
there
i
go
romanticizing
beer
again
just
drink
one
yet
not
a
bad
one
for
when
you
have
a
bit
of
a
cold
i
guess
the
charcoal
can
cut
through
just
about
anything
overall
quite
an
interesting
combination
of
blueberry
and
stout
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
was
happily
surprised
not
sure
how
old
this
bottle
is
but
its
held
up
well
i
found
this
beer
was
better
colder
and
became
harder
to
drink
as
it
warmed
regardless
worth
a
shot
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
blueberries
there
is
not
as
much
fruit
in
the
aroma
as
i
expected
the
flavor
is
different
as
the
fruit
is
much
more
apparent
i
get
a
lot
of
blueberry
character
as
well
as
some
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
smoke
the
beer
has
a
slight
medicinal
tastes
but
it
works
ok
in
this
beer
there
is
a
strong
lingering
blueberry
aftertaste
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
high
hopes
after
a
strong
start
falls
just
a
bit
short
might
work
well
as
a
dessert
or
even
breakfast
beer
split
with
a
friend
dark
horses
tres
taken
as
a
regular
american
stout
is
really
good
add
in
the
blueberry
aromaflavors
and
you
got
something
special
easy
drinking
as
far
as
stouts
go
not
much
alcohol
but
a
ton
of
flavor
great
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
and
not
too
heavy
the
best
non
russian
or
imperial
stout
ive
had
in
a
long
time
an
excellent
stout
though
with
some
weird
carbonation
and
a
fair
level
of
sweetness
i
dont
know
if
i
could
have
this
one
all
night
pretty
good
stout
that
really
showcases
the
blueberries
well
worth
a
try
for
something
unique
d
pretty
good
stout
but
not
one
i
would
want
to
drink
very
often
blueberry
works
well
with
the
roasted
character
of
this
beer
but
its
not
that
noticeable
and
doesnt
really
add
enough
to
this
beer
to
make
me
want
to
choose
it
over
a
number
of
other
stouts
bonus
points
for
drinkability
for
low
abv
while
maintaining
flavor
and
great
mouthfeel
the
flavors
are
all
very
bold
i
couldnt
see
myself
sessioning
this
beer
but
i
would
definitely
enjoy
the
two
or
three
that
id
have
before
i
was
done
would
i
buy
more
of
it
absolutely
id
buy
a
lot
more
if
i
could
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
mildly
fruity
sweet
in
the
palate
not
sure
what
to
think
about
it
it
is
really
quite
bitter
i
am
not
really
enjoying
this
beer
and
im
glad
i
split
it
at
this
point
not
a
repeat
didnt
taste
like
blueberries
or
smell
like
them
what
a
wreck
d
this
is
the
second
bluberry
stout
ive
tasted
and
this
version
blew
the
other
one
out
of
the
water
it
was
like
putting
dark
chocolate
on
your
blueberry
pie
d
no
problem
to
have
quite
a
few
of
these
di
was
expecting
a
blueberry
explosion
and
didnt
get
it
but
nonetheless
a
good
beer
overall
and
worth
getting
again
d
not
too
heavy
a
stout
and
it
shouldnt
be
at
only
4
5
thanks
very
much
to
grownfool
for
including
this
as
an
extra
in
our
recent
trade
pours
nearly
black
with
a
2
inch
tan
head
as
advertised
smells
like
dark
roasted
malt
blueberries
and
a
dash
of
cocoa
quite
nice
for
a
stout
consumed
on
a
summer
day
the
flavor
is
in
accord
charred
malts
blueberries
and
cocoa
never
had
a
blueberry
stout
before
but
this
definitely
works
blueberries
arent
so
strong
as
to
push
this
into
a
nasty
fruit
beer
mess
nor
so
subtle
that
you
barely
notice
them
nor
is
this
beer
excessively
sweet
body
is
medium
with
lots
of
carbonation
if
this
really
is
only
4
5
its
surprising
as
i
would
guess
its
more
like
6
57
overall
quite
a
tasty
beverage
that
id
try
again
if
i
lived
within
distribution
range
i
expected
more
blueberry
taste
but
it
did
well
as
a
subtle
note
adding
to
all
the
chocolate
deliciousness
overall
awesome
d
one
of
those
differentinteresting
beers
that
actually
was
quite
good
i
look
forward
to
having
another
one
of
these
done
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
i
miss
american
beer
full
bodied
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
that
adds
fullness
and
complexity
verydry
and
roasty
with
hits
of
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
coffee
bean
and
burnt
toast
hut
this
is
balanced
out
by
subtle
dry
spic
and
swee
dark
fruit
the
bluberry
presence
is
evident
but
not
verly
sweet
balancing
outthe
roasted
malt
notes
very
well
slight
alcohol
warmth
onthe
finish
pretty
drinkable
for
how
heavy
it
is
black
nothing
comes
through
when
holding
to
the
light
rich
tan
head
forms
on
a
pour
but
it
dissaptes
to
nothing
quickly
yep
there
are
blueberries
in
there
fruity
boo
berry
cereal
aroma
wafts
from
the
glass
its
not
a
bad
aroma
at
all
just
different
for
a
beer
if
this
beer
were
a
standard
stout
it
would
be
an
amazing
one
with
the
blueberries
it
makes
it
interesting
and
a
nice
change
from
the
ordinary
nice
rich
velvety
stout
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
a
touch
of
roasted
coffee
and
cocoa
blueberry
is
not
overwhelming
just
a
nice
touch
mouthfeel
is
full
and
rich
d
pretty
decent
and
certainly
easy
to
drink
at
4
5
im
glad
this
wasnt
an
overly
sweet
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
blueberry
flavor
happy
to
try
would
drink
it
again
i
let
some
of
the
beer
warm
up
quite
a
bit
while
distracted
with
other
activities
and
most
of
the
blueberry
flavor
left
which
might
explain
the
reactions
of
several
recent
reviews
take
note
this
should
be
poured
around
40
when
the
blueberry
smell
and
flavor
is
more
evident
pours
a
very
nicely
carbonated
opaque
black
topped
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
mocha
colored
foam
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
as
it
warms
fresh
blueberries
the
blueberries
are
very
nicely
integrated
into
the
flavors
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
another
nice
one
from
dark
horse
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
thick
and
this
drinks
pretty
easily
if
this
werent
labeled
with
the
word
blueberry
it
would
score
pretty
highly
as
it
is
though
as
drinkable
as
it
is
it
is
only
worthy
of
a
b
dry
taste
but
without
bitterness
or
hopping
usually
the
roast
from
the
malt
has
a
little
too
much
contribution
though
once
you
get
accustomed
to
it
it
approaches
a
smooth
mouthfeel
not
a
thick
sludge
stout
by
any
means
a
great
palate
cleanser
relatively
speaking
as
long
as
you
arent
drinking
other
fruit
beers
i
guess
minimal
coffee
feel
not
overly
sweet
like
bad
fruit
beers
still
tastes
like
beer
dark
horse
brewing
company
has
a
nice
thing
going
with
the
stout
series
i
really
like
every
one
of
them
i
was
least
excited
to
try
tres
but
its
good
it
has
a
nice
solid
flavor
and
works
in
every
respect
i
do
think
a
little
more
body
and
fewer
bubbles
would
help
but
otherwise
it
works
if
you
havent
had
a
chance
to
check
out
the
series
do
so
its
impressive
overall
i
thought
it
was
an
unexpectedly
nice
brew
was
not
expecting
to
like
this
one
as
much
as
i
did
the
blueberry
balances
the
flavors
within
this
brew
better
than
i
imagined
for
those
who
dont
like
an
all
out
stout
and
enjoy
fruity
beers
this
could
be
a
huge
hit
with
you
that
said
i
love
the
heartiest
of
stouts
and
this
brew
still
appeals
to
me
definitely
a
unique
stout
worth
trying
thanks
to
steve
for
the
bottle
and
a
great
driveby
trade
thanks
again
jon
for
this
awesome
beer
now
ive
gotta
go
get
more
d
i
already
know
exactly
what
dessert
i
would
pair
this
with
i
think
i
could
only
be
able
to
handle
this
guy
in
small
portions
extremely
complex
pallet
shocking
and
delicious
a
great
buy
d
killer
drink
here
for
sure
i
havent
had
anything
like
this
and
at
first
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
but
hell
if
this
aint
great
d
goes
down
easy
which
isnt
common
with
many
fruitflavoured
beers
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
that
i
would
buy
again
d
another
great
stout
from
dark
horse
they
one
too
tres
fore
plead
the
5th
are
all
in
the
same
realm
as
far
as
the
malt
profile
is
concerned
this
one
takes
the
sweetness
to
a
much
different
level
which
i
believe
is
successful
a
very
smoth
drinkable
stout
the
blue
berry
comes
through
in
the
aeoma
and
a
vey
nic
hint
on
the
tounge
we
bought
this
beer
at
our
favorite
beer
store
in
big
rapids
grunst
brothers
its
also
the
second
time
we
bought
it
and
will
be
at
the
top
of
our
list
agian
very
tasty
brew
makes
it
very
drinkable
d
im
very
glad
i
picked
this
up
dark
horse
is
showing
me
lately
that
they
know
what
they
are
doing
with
stouts
ive
had
tres
and
too
now
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
two
stouts
in
this
series
highly
recommended
i
am
impressed
with
this
stout
it
is
slightly
lighter
in
body
and
alcohol
than
most
stouts
i
have
had
but
enjoyable
still
my
aversion
to
fruit
flavored
beers
is
gone
at
least
in
this
stout
that
is
d
nice
and
refreshing
for
summer
not
light
enough
to
be
a
hot
summer
day
beer
but
certainly
a
nice
spring
night
beer
smooth
and
clean
tasting
beer
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
blueberries
can
be
quite
potent
in
beer
but
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
they
were
handled
pretty
favorable
in
this
stout
especially
in
the
taste
where
they
didnt
come
off
as
artificial
tasting
at
all
and
were
well
integrated
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
just
a
bit
too
heavy
feeling
to
be
totally
sessionable
but
this
was
overall
pretty
nice
pretty
good
overall
not
awesome
but
good
drinkability
is
high
4
5
damn
dogg
this
is
a
real
session
beer
hmmm
carbonation
is
a
tad
high
and
just
slight
coffee
flavors
a
late
blueberry
hits
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
at
fridge
temp
as
it
warms
it
gets
a
lot
better
and
the
flavor
really
improves
more
blueberry
and
mild
coffee
flavors
reside
with
a
medium
to
light
body
still
high
carbonation
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
stout
maybe
its
all
of
the
ipa
drinking
i
have
been
doing
lately
but
this
beer
was
not
as
easy
for
me
to
drink
as
some
stouts
i
have
had
it
has
the
heavy
almost
chewiness
of
imperial
stouts
without
the
abv
just
by
the
magnitude
of
this
beer
i
would
have
expected
it
to
have
twice
the
abv
that
it
does
this
could
be
a
full
meal
d
very
drinkable
stout
that
fuses
roastedness
and
fruit
as
well
dark
horse
just
seems
to
not
do
wrong
with
anything
they
do
drinkability
was
good
as
well
i
think
this
is
a
winner
dark
horse
walks
the
line
without
falling
into
fruit
hell
nice
beer
fellas
d
very
easy
to
drink
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
drinkability
a
strong
moderately
complex
stout
the
blueberry
flavor
provides
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
traditional
variety
the
bitter
aftertaste
will
slow
me
down
a
little
bit
but
this
is
a
good
stout
to
rotate
into
the
mix
d
the
stout
tastes
bigger
than
it
is
full
and
filling
this
beer
would
be
perfect
on
a
cold
winter
night
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
though
kind
of
disappointing
as
i
thought
it
would
be
a
little
stronger
overall
a
great
complex
fruit
based
stout
it
is
unique
to
be
sure
but
delicious
nonetheless
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
two
perfect
for
a
desert
beer
pick
this
up
if
you
see
it
d
highly
drinkable
due
to
ease
of
taste
and
low
alcohol
doesnt
taste
much
like
beer
think
you
could
give
this
to
anyone
even
bmc
drinkers
and
theyd
be
able
to
enjoy
it
pretty
easily
not
sure
if
blueberry
is
the
right
direction
to
head
with
a
stout
think
it
might
work
better
in
a
wild
ale
a
good
attempt
solid
beer
but
it
would
be
great
if
someone
could
do
a
novelty
stout
like
this
and
make
something
really
kickass
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
the
beer
is
a
bit
too
carbonated
for
a
stout
not
bad
to
sip
but
needs
the
right
food
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
astringent
bitter
and
dry
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
with
a
medium
full
finish
this
is
an
odd
beer
combo
but
somehow
works
fairly
well
the
blueberry
stand
out
and
the
stout
is
hidden
a
little
bit
i
would
have
like
to
seen
it
be
equal
single
from
the
foodery
nl
philadelphia
pours
black
with
big
rocky
brown
head
sticks
around
for
a
while
but
eventually
fades
smell
is
decent
twodimensional
blueberries
and
roast
coffee
not
terrible
but
not
melded
at
all
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
good
blueberry
notes
on
top
of
a
decent
stout
typical
roasted
flavors
with
some
chocolate
mf
is
very
smooth
and
oily
i
like
the
carbonation
level
decently
drinkable
not
something
i
would
want
to
make
a
night
out
of
d
darkhorse
has
a
top
notch
winner
on
their
hands
here
the
addition
of
blueberries
makes
the
a
truly
unique
offering
wonderfully
executed
in
all
facets
with
many
memorable
characteristics
if
thats
not
enough
the
4
5
abv
makes
this
exceedingly
quaffable
i
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
as
my
past
experience
with
fruit
infused
stouts
hasnt
been
positive
but
this
a
top
notch
offering
in
every
respect
have
i
mentioned
im
really
impressed
excellent
beer
the
taste
is
dark
roasted
malt
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
the
blueberries
are
present
but
not
as
strong
as
i
thought
they
might
be
medium
bodied
and
average
carbonation
a
nice
easy
to
drink
stout
which
i
would
buy
again
very
interesting
experience
i
have
had
other
fruited
stouts
and
enjoyed
them
as
much
as
i
enjoy
this
one
the
blueberry
was
an
interesting
choice
and
i
think
it
goes
well
d
good
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
blueberry
is
lost
i
will
say
it
was
nice
that
the
blueberry
was
not
overdone
and
the
blueberry
does
work
well
with
this
beer
but
it
is
also
on
the
light
side
leading
to
a
better
than
average
but
not
overly
unique
stout
at
4
5
this
is
actually
a
pretty
muscular
stout
while
you
dont
feel
much
alcohol
the
big
roasty
flavors
probably
limit
this
to
2
glasses
or
so
once
again
proving
that
big
beers
dont
necessarily
have
to
be
high
in
abv
a
good
idea
and
very
well
executed
the
beer
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
brown
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
stiff
black
malt
earthiness
as
well
a
touch
of
chocolate
malt
sweetness
the
blueberry
aroma
is
fresh
and
damn
enticing
there
is
a
nice
roasted
character
here
the
taste
is
decent
its
bone
dry
with
lots
of
roasted
black
malts
present
it
goes
down
easy
with
a
bit
of
prickly
carbonation
the
blueberry
flavoring
seems
artificial
most
likely
extract
which
is
disappointing
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
i
believe
needs
some
minute
tinkering
its
a
good
drinker
that
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
buying
in
the
future
pours
a
rich
dark
near
black
with
a
minimal
khaki
colored
head
minimal
retention
and
ok
lacing
smell
is
of
earth
ash
roasted
nuts
cocoa
powder
and
blueberry
dark
roasted
malts
are
at
the
forefront
with
a
earthy
ashy
quality
to
them
the
blueberry
comes
through
and
does
not
over
power
akin
to
a
blueberry
pancake
hints
of
cocoa
powder
and
a
slight
bittering
at
the
end
body
is
medium
semi
creamy
with
maybe
a
touch
too
much
carbonation
very
nice
beer
where
the
fruit
flavor
is
neither
over
or
underpowered
in
relation
to
the
other
ingredients
would
have
prefered
a
little
more
body
and
creamyness
to
compliment
the
flavors
overall
a
good
fruit
stout
i
would
have
preferred
more
fruit
character
but
the
roasted
notes
are
wellbalanced
overall
better
than
i
was
expecting
blueberries
are
represented
perfectly
notes
i
like
stouts
and
i
like
fruit
beers
know
im
in
the
minority
for
the
latter
so
im
very
pleased
to
announce
that
dark
horse
has
adeptly
combined
both
styles
to
produce
something
delicious
and
unique
however
tres
blueberry
is
definitely
a
stout
first
and
foremost
as
any
flavored
stout
should
be
its
a
stouts
stout
which
just
so
happens
to
taste
like
blueberrys
tres
bien
id
say
this
beer
goes
beyond
being
just
a
good
stout
with
fruit
added
but
one
of
the
best
standard
stouts
ive
had
full
stop
this
is
the
first
beer
from
dark
horse
ive
sampled
and
color
me
impressed
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
their
beers
i
got
this
from
dunt
in
a
bif
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
perfect
pint
glass
it
is
jet
black
in
color
and
pours
very
thick
the
head
is
about
2
fingers
and
tan
in
color
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
slight
roasted
coffee
with
blueberry
muffins
the
flavor
is
roasted
coffee
with
nice
amounts
of
sweet
chocolate
it
has
enough
hops
for
balnce
the
blueberries
are
there
as
a
background
it
finished
with
a
lingering
sweetness
it
is
medium
in
body
and
highly
carbonated
this
beer
really
worked
for
me
very
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
i
could
session
with
this
thanks
again
to
prototypic
for
a
great
trade
and
great
extras
taste
blueberry
isnt
as
central
in
the
taste
as
it
was
in
the
smell
dark
chocolate
flavor
and
decent
bitterness
definitely
a
sipper
of
a
beer
to
be
savored
this
beer
is
interesting
to
say
the
least
and
chalk
full
of
flavour
at
4
5
abv
its
would
make
a
great
session
stout
the
fruitiness
lending
a
refreshing
quality
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
beers
from
these
guys
soon
92100
d
tres
surprised
me
in
a
lot
of
ways
it
has
more
body
and
flavor
that
i
expected
from
its
meager
abv
but
doesnt
have
the
drinkability
that
i
would
have
expected
the
blueberries
arent
overdone
but
combined
with
the
peppery
notes
it
doesnt
do
much
for
drinkability
md
excellent
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
and
possibly
the
most
unique
one
ive
ever
had
overall
a
very
interesting
and
well
integrated
stout
i
liked
the
addition
of
blueberry
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
the
stouts
in
the
series
recommended
if
this
beer
were
available
to
me
all
of
the
time
i
would
have
it
by
the
case
it
has
as
good
a
feel
as
most
impy
stouts
that
ive
had
its
damn
near
as
flavorful
and
its
only
4
5
abv
i
want
more
a
lot
more
a
really
really
interesting
and
complex
beer
a
great
installment
to
a
really
great
series
thanks
to
ericwo
for
sending
me
this
one
poured
out
deep
black
with
a
creamy
two
finger
head
smells
lightly
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
blueberries
and
some
spiciness
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
taste
is
blueberries
up
front
stout
in
the
middle
then
a
combination
of
the
two
in
the
finish
its
a
nice
balance
that
blends
really
well
the
blueberries
arent
too
intense
or
overwhelming
and
lend
nicely
to
the
roasty
chocolaty
flavors
of
the
stout
like
a
homemade
blueberry
muffin
medium
to
full
body
smooth
and
creamy
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
excellent
for
dessert
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
but
couldnt
really
see
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
i
liked
this
very
much
im
leary
on
blueberry
beers
because
i
find
the
taste
to
be
a
lot
like
morning
cereals
but
dark
horse
really
impressed
me
with
this
offering
i
would
not
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
even
with
the
low
abv
but
i
see
myself
getting
this
again
in
the
future
d
this
beer
has
been
done
right
subtle
flavors
from
the
fruit
while
the
style
is
still
portrayed
he
way
it
should
be
very
enjoyable
drinkable
but
in
all
fairness
not
my
favorite
style
the
blueberry
stout
pours
deep
black
with
an
extremely
deep
tan
color
frothy
head
that
quickly
fizzles
away
not
much
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
malted
stout
smell
at
the
base
with
a
sweet
fruity
kick
that
takes
over
as
the
beer
warms
up
i
hate
to
be
original
but
there
is
a
lot
of
blueberry
in
the
nose
the
quaff
also
has
lots
of
blueberry
in
it
with
a
nice
crisp
bitter
finish
i
really
am
enjoying
the
taste
of
this
beer
something
new
to
me
but
the
sweetness
is
very
well
balanced
with
the
malty
and
bitter
notes
from
this
style
mouthfeel
is
fairly
think
drinkability
is
good
not
great
for
what
it
is
it
is
very
good
tasting
just
blueberry
stout
is
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
regularly
overall
good
beer
from
dark
horse
very
tasty
overall
this
is
medium
to
fully
body
a
slight
creamy
edge
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
fruit
addition
very
nice
drinkable
and
sessionable
there
is
so
much
going
on
though
that
you
cant
help
but
stop
and
ponder
over
the
tasty
black
liquid
you
are
drinking
thanks
to
chonyr
for
bringing
this
north
its
damn
good
stuff
and
something
i
would
highly
recommend
to
fans
of
blueberries
and
stouts
i
like
dark
beers
and
this
is
a
fantastic
one
d
being
on
the
lower
alcohol
end
of
the
spectrum
for
an
american
stout
make
this
one
pretty
drinkable
a
good
fruit
flavored
stout
md
good
flavor
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
i
would
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
the
mouth
on
this
was
stellar
a
thick
creamy
wash
over
the
entire
palate
this
was
almost
downright
chewable
flavors
of
chocolate
roasted
nuts
some
espresso
and
the
slightest
hints
of
blueberry
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
this
doesnt
smack
of
cheap
fruit
concentrates
wow
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
i
daresay
i
guzzled
this
one
i
wish
i
had
more
d
good
stout
pours
a
nice
black
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
chocolatetoffee
slight
blueberry
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
very
nice
touch
of
chocolatetoffee
picking
up
more
of
the
blueberry
now
medium
body
got
some
heat
for
a
4
5

with
a
steady
thick
tanmocha
head
that
has
great
retention
but
very
little

looks
like
an
amazing
stout
rich
complex
aroma
of
a
roasted
malt
smoke
dark
chocolate
a
little
coffee
etc
finishes
with
slightly
sweet
note
of
blueberry
not
quite
as
strong
as
i
hoped
for
but
again
smells
like
a
great
stout
creamy
medium
thick
body
with
minimal
carbonation
flavor
begins
and
ends
with
mild
blueberry
sweetness
and
body
has
great
balanced
flavored
with
strong
roasted

flavor
with
chocolate
smoke
and
other
dark
flavors
like
the
nose
easily
one
of
my
favorite
easy
drinking
beers
i
would
actually
prefer
a
little
more
fruit
flavor
but
otherwise
no
complaints
pours
black
and
thick
blueberry
somewhat
natural
aroma
and
oily
roast
aroma
above

almost
no

certainly
no

a
decent
dry

abv

thanks
jon
d
another
quality
stout
from
dark
horse
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
blueberry
flavor
provides
good
break
from
your
typical
stout
flavors
ill
have
to
buy
more
of
this
next
time
i
am
in
illinois
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
you
can
sip
on
this
delcious
beer
all
night
theres
nothing
off
putting
and
at
4
5
this
beer
will
do
you
no
harm
enjoy
there
is
plenty
of
blueberry
and
grape
jelly
in
the
taste
and
it
is
blended
harmoniously
with
bitter
chocolate
toffee
roasted
chestnuts
and
vanilla
this
beer
is
dangerously
sessionable
and
highly
drinkable
i
had
this
with
a
chocolate
cake
and
it
paired
incredibly
such
a
great
dessert
beer
if
you
like
blueberries
and
i
do
one
of
my
favorite
fruit
stouts
d
highly
drinkable
i
finished
the
goblet
fast
delicious
edit
after
warming
up
a
lot
more
of
that
delicious
blueberry
flavor
came
out
as
a
fan
of
sours
and
stouts
this
is
truly
a
great
beer
the
beer
pours
amazingly
dark
just
like
the
other
two
to
this
point
the
head
on
this
one
comes
out
fighting
i
mean
well
over
an
inch
pushing
2
but
the
bubbles
are
loose
and
rush
very
quickly
pushing
the
dark
liquid
up
on
top
of
them
really
interesting
to
see
but
if
you
look
away
for
just
a
second
the
head
is
gone
the
smell
without
question
immediately
reminds
me
of
blueberry
muffins
i
mean
its
very
bready
a
bit
grainy
filled
with
overripe
caramelized
blueberries
maybe
a
dayold
blueberry
muffin
one
thats
a
little
cold
very
good
the
smell
if
you
look
for
it
has
a
nice
roastiness
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
some
light
coffee
smells
some
burnt
bits
it
says
its
a
blueberry
stout
and
when
you
smell
it
you
can
tell
the
taste
keeps
on
where
the
smell
ends
there
a
great
burst
of
ripe
blueberry
in
each
taste
but
almost
no
tartness
like
young
blueberries
theres
an
incredible
breadiness
sweet
an
cakey
but
efinitely
not
too
sweet
you
get
a
bit
of
burnt
bread
a
tiny
bit
of
chocolate
thats
the
extent
of
roastiness
the
body
on
this
is
nice
not
too
heavy
and
full
not
like
the
others
but
i
suppose
that
its
tough
when
the
abv
is
so
much
less
but
the
carbonation
definitely
does
not
have
the
same
burst
as
the
others
pretty
normal
with
a
bit
of
a
slickness
from
the
fruit
the
drinkability
on
this
is
pretty
good
i
mean
its
not
going
to
hamper
further
drinking
too
much
as
some
flavored
beers
tend
to
do
and
the
abv
isnt
too
high
but
the
fruitiness
would
keep
me
from
coming
back
to
this
often
ive
had
the
privilege
of
trying
tres
blueberry
stout
on
many
occasions
now
and
each
time
i
come
back
to
it
i
am
more
impressed
and
gratified
the
way
that
dark
horse
has
managed
to
integrate
the
tart
tannic
wild
and
dark
berry
flavour
of
the
fruit
into
this
classically
rich
base
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malts
is
nothing
short
of
mouthwatering
not
to
say
downright
heavenly
if
paired
with
the
right
dessert
highly
recommended
d
smooth
and
tasty
this
is
the
most
dessert
worthy
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
time
doesnt
need
anything
to
accompany
it
although
i
imagine
it
would
go
extremely
well
with
chocolate
cake
very
drinkable
smooth
and
easy
have
to
get
more
of
these
at
4
5
this
is
a
ridiculously
delicious
beer
that
wont
kill
you
in
the
drinking
it
also
means
it
has
a
lighter
body
than
many
other
stouts
and
makes
it
feel
lighter
and
a
little
less
luxurious
that
said
the
flavor
holds
it
up
its
quite
drinkable
though
the
blueberry
limits
what
you
can
pair
it
with
more
a
dessert
beer
but
normally
i
look
for
something
a
little
heavier
in
that
category
nonetheless
delicious
all
around
great
beer
thanks

brian2345
for
the
extra
pours
black
with
thin
brown
head
on
the
edges
smells
of
roasted
malt
light
chocolate
mild
fruit
some
cinnamon
nothing
special
tastes
the
same
with
roasted
malt
dominating
and
light
fruit
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
that
finishes
with
just
a
slight
bittterness
one
is
good
enough
for
me
way
to
much
carbonation
roast
is
much
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
with
a
burnt
coffee
core
that
holds
up
notes
of
chocolate
and
toasted
caramel
the
blueberry
is
all
but
an
afterthoughta
vinous
tart
note
thats
overridden
by
a
snappy
almost
impeding
carbonation
level
the
body
is
as
thin
as
youd
expect
for
a
4
5
stout
with
a
smooth
finish
that
leaves
some
sticky
residuals
as
if
it
were
a
much
bigger
imperial
stout
still
the
low
abv
adds
to
the
drinkability
as
does
the
fact
that
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
from
a
solid
michigan
brewery
the
taste
was
overwhelmingly
of
blueberry
with
a
sweetness
that
seemed
true
to
the
fruit
itself
some
mocha
chocolate
notes
a
slightly
understated
coffee
presence
more
sweet
than
bitter
and
quite
delicious
the
real
bitterness
although
understated
came
at
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
nutty
astringency
that
lasted
quite
long
there
was
a
slightly
creamy
texture
and
it
was
a
bit
thin
in
body
for
a
stout
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
an
abundance
of
natural
berry
fruit
set
in
a
dark
malt
backdropvery
nicely
done
by
dark
horse
brewing
company
another
winning
recipe
well
worth
the
1
99
i
paid
for
it
at
merchants
in
dearborn
too
bad
i
didnt
pick
up
six
more
of
these
drinks
really
easy
would
be
winner
with
or
without
the
blueberries
good
stuff
glad
to
have
tried
it
drinkability
since
i
love
blueberries
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
i
was
not
disappointed
i
really
like
this
beer
the
flavors
just
work
this
is
arguably
the
nicest
fruit
beer
ive
had
and
i
could
easily
sip
it
all
night
im
already
looking
forward
to
my
next
one
even
before
this
one
is
finished
bottle
pours
black
with
a
small
light
tan
head
aroma
of
blueberry
muffins
also
sort
of
smells
like
glue
flavor
is
lightly
roasted
with
the
sweet
blueberryglue
interesting
stout
but
the
blueberry
flavor
is
a
bit
odd
to
me
ill
have
to
try
this
again

at
the
grand

almost
black

maine
blueberries
with
a
whisper

and
a
roasted

interesting

i
like
the
subtlety

thin
low
abv
easy
session
stout
drinkability
i
have
to
say
that
im
very
happy
that
this
is
only
4
5
it
makes
the
drinkability
of
this
stout
so
much
easier
to
call
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
and
not
get
bored
at
all
well
done
dark
horse
ta
very
nice
session
stout
it
is
hard
to
pack
much
flavor
into
a
4
5
beer
though
so
it
doesnt
peak
my
interest
too
much
they
need
to
market
this
in
maine
it
would
sell
great
overall
i
didnt
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
it
was
way
too
smokey
i
would
have
rather
had
more
blueberries
instead
of
the
smoke
i
will
not
being
having
this
again
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
crisp
for
my
tastes
to
the
point
that
the
initial
bite
distracts
from
the
taste
a
bit
of
swirling
improves
things
nice
full
body
this
beer
drinks
very
easily
could
easily
have
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
night
i
am
only
recently
exploring
stouts
in
the
last
couple
of
months
and
this
is
not
one
of
my
top
3
or
4
it
is
certainly
the
most
unique
ive
had
very
identifiable
flavors
super
unique
and
highly
recommended
for
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
bitters
or
stouts
d
a
unique
stout
the
blueberry
flavors
are
just
enough
to
be
enjoyable
without
being
overbearing
i
was
shocked
to
see
that
this
was
4
5
abv
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
i
would
love
to
see
some
more
flavorful
stouts
like
this
at
this
kind
of
abv
d
i
would
serve
this
beer
after
a
meal
for
desert
its
almost
like
having
an
after
dinner
treat
d
very
easy
to
drink
likable
flavors
lovable
feel
and
aroma
glad
to
have
tried
this
id
certainly
have
another
one
d
awesome
i
really
love
this
beer
its
something
unique
and
fun
ill
be
seeking
more
of
this
out
often
keeps
you
thinking
and
is
so
low
in
abv
you
can
have
a
few
to
study
the
subtle
nuances
of
such
a
great
beer
tastes
the
same
without
being
overly
sweet
i
find
this
absolutely
delectable
albeit
one
glass
of
this
is
more
than
enough
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
one
instead
of
just
the
one
bottle
dh
should
really
think
about
making
this
a
regular
release
12
oz

pour
with
a
surprisingly
dark
brown
head
head
disappates
fairly
quickly
aroma
of
some
coffee
and
chocolate
covered
blueberry
i
didnt
think
the
blueberry
was
too
strong
in
the
aroma
or
flavor
but
others
thought
it
was
a
bit
much
in
the
aroma
flavor
is
a
good
stout
roast
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
blueberry
is
sprinkled
in
and
definetely
has
an
interesting
effect
more
in
the
finish
the
blueberry
is
what
makes
this
not
quite
as
good
as
the
too
cream
stout
still
stands
on
its
own
merits
however
an
excellent
unique
brew
all
the
dark
horse
stouts
are
a
must
try
excellent
stout
from
dark
horse
most
peoples
favorite
of
the
holiday
stout
series
though
im
also
a
fan
of
too
pick
this
up
if
you
havent
tried
it
drinkability
is
great
a
wonderfully
rich
fruit
infused
dark
brew
which
is
few
and
far
between
the
blueberries
impart
a
subtle
sweetness
that
when
combined
with
the
malts
produces
a
brilliant
profile

none

is

the
roasted

this
is
a

i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
the
next
time
i
see
it
what
i
cracked
with
my
breakfast
im
a
big
fan
i
think
ill
have
to
see
if
i
can
hunt
up
another
four
pack
around
madison
i
really
dug
this
beer
my
only
other
forray
into
a
blueberry
beer
is
the
one
made
by
marin
brewing
and
that
one
has
never
been
one
of
my
favorites
im
not
sure
i
would
chase
down
this
beer
again
but
i
am
very
glad
i
was
given
the
chance
to
try
it
kinda
makes
me
want
to
play
with
fruit
stouts

comuserthegrandolehopry1
d
an
interesting
worthwhile
combination
between
roasted
malt
and
tart
blueberry
that
is
worth
a
try
but
its
not
something
i
would
crave
nor
purchase
often
kudos
to
dark
horse
for
taking
the
risk
however
sensational
drinkability
i
love
lowgravity
stouts
and
could
session
with
this
all
night
im
picturing
an
orgasmic
caskconditioned

of
this

very
nice
like
a
blueberry
muffin
and
a
cup
of
coffee
for

taste
is
nice

mixed
with

chocolate
semisweet
at
first
dry
on
the

nice
thick

appropriately
low

this
is
a
very
nice
stout
not
quite
as
good
as
the
too
milk
stout
but
impressive
and
another
great
stout
from
dark
horse
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
very
little
head
just
a
slight
dusting
of
dark
beige
fluffiness
and
leaving
around
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
like
a
fruity
fudge
pop
dark
fudge
cream
and
blueberries
all
come
out
in
the
nose
the
flavor
follows
suit
almost
to
a
tee
milk
chocolate
fudge
cream
and
blueberry
juice
the
blueberries
in
the
flavor
remind
me
more
of
an
artificial
blueberry
then
the
actual
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
dry
i
thought
there
might
be
oatmeal
in
the
mash
but
the
creaminess
dies
in
the
finish
dryness
is
all
i
get
from
the
tip
of
the
tongue
this
is
a
good
beer
i
wish
the
creaminess
would
come
out
a
bit
more
and
the
blueberry
was
a
bit
more
real
medium
body
with
mellow
carbonation
lend
some
smoothness
to
the
mouth
yet
there
is
a
bit
of
prickliness
here
and
there
overall
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
very
intriging
flavor
a
stout
of
its
own
this
was
my
first
dark
horse
brew
and
i
will
definetly
be
looking
for
more
4oz
sample
shared
the
bottle
with
2
others
pours
black
like
the
others
in
the
series
no
transparency
nice
creamy
brown
head
which
leaves
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
obvious
sweet
blueberries
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
flavors
are
milk
chocolate
espresso
and
finishes
fairly
boldly
with
roasted
malts
and
fresh
ripe
blueberries
that
are
not
overbearing
in
flavor
this
was
something
i
was
concerned
with
prior
to
drinking
it
they
were
actually
quite
pleasant
i
liked
this
unique
stout
and
it
was
worth
the
try
given
it
was
in
a
series
of
5
but
wouldnt
try
it
again
i
find
that
often
times
a
lot
of
interesting
or
creative
beers
offering
different
takes
on
a
style
or
a
wildly
different
take
dont
really
work
see
my
aprihop
120
min
or
autumn
maple
reviews
i
like
to
try
for
curiosity
sake
but
i
dont
often
love
the
beer
the
tres
however
is
fantastic
the
blueberry
makes
the
beer
interesting
complex
and
tasty
i
enjoyed
this
all
the
way
through
a
noteworthy
beer
and
now
one
i
need
to
figure
out
how
to
get
my
hands
on
with
regularity
damn
fair
to
say
i
am
blown
away
this
is
a
rich
beer
but
not
a
big
abv
beer
still
it
is
a
sipper
and
one
i
would
not
want
more
than
two
of
at
a
time
never
the
less
this
is
one
of
the
better
flavored
stouts
i
have
had
this
is
one
good
stout
not
overpowering
in
any
way
i
only
picked
up
one
and
plan
on
grabbing
a
few
more
super
low
abv
means
drink
up
d
i
find
this
to
be
very
drinkable
great
flavor
and
only
4
5
abv
if
i
was
the
type
to
drink
one
beer
all
night
i
could
do
this
one
easily
d
fair
i
would
not
order
another
or
a
six
pack
drinkability
chalk
this
one
up
as
a
happy
surprise
i
can
definitely
see
myself
buying
this
again
its
kind
of
gimmicky
but
still
a
pretty
solid
brew
not
something
where
id
want
to
have
more
than
one
serving
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
duvel
tulip
glass
appears
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
hearty
finger
of
rich
dark
tan
foam
really
nice
to
look
at
smells
reminds
me
of
chocolate
covered
dried
blueberries
kind
of
like
the
ones
harry
david
sellsused
to
sell
notes
of
molasses
and
raisins
are
also
evident
tastes
of
rich
roasted
grains
caramel
mocha
and
real
blueberries
nothing
artificial
or
fake
about
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
blueberries
medium
maybe
a
touch
thin
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
out
of
the
handful
of
blueberry
stouts
that
ive
tried
this
is
no
doubt
the
best
by
a
huge
margin
d
very
easy
to
drink
cant
pick
up
alcohol
and
the
flavor
tastes
nice
a
creamy
warm
roasted
malt
is
the
base
of
its
flavor
dark
coffee
and
chocolate
abounds
til
the
blueberry
envelopes
them
in
a
stately
but
not
overstated
manner
the
finish
is
a
nice
balance
of
all
the
flavors
that
leave
enough
time
to
savior
but
not
staying
around
too
long
thanks
dark
horse
keep
up
the
great
fantastic
work
incredible
wow
that
is
something
not
an
overwhelming
blueberry
taste
this
is
a
thick
strong
brew
with
great
coffee
chocolate
and
just
the
slightest
blueberry
hint
in
the
after
taste
nothing
of
what
i
expected
it
to
be
better
i
could
get
a
little
sick
of
the
aftertaste
if
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
but
if
like
today
when
i
am
just
having
an
after
dinner
drink
this
is
fantastic
excellent
wellrounded
and
unique
stout
overall
an
enjoyable
unique
beer
in
that
ive
never
had
a
blueverry
stout
before
plenty
of
blueberry
beers
and
stouts
but
never
together
this
easily
surpasses
a
black
and
blue
combination
of
guinness
and
wachusett
blueberry
the
local
favorite
drinkability
could
really
be
higher
all
things
considered
but
its
an
all
around
pleasant
beer
and
hopefully
one
i
will
drink
again
thanks
to
weirdbeer
for
hooking
this
up
in
our
trade
this
brew
pours
up
black
with
a
nice
brown
head
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
blueberries
chocolate
malts
sweet
and
roasty
malts
too
i
taste
big
toasty
malts
combating
with
intense
blueberry
acids
creating
this
crazy
battle
in
my
mouth
good
but
weird
in
a
way
slight
hop
bittering
in
the
finish
full
bodied
med
to
low
carbo
decent
not
dark
horses
best
work
but
very
interesting
enough
hats
off
this
pours
a
dark
midnight
blueblack
color
with
very
little
head
but
a
great
looking
amber
black
ring
and
lacing
til
the
finish
very
nice
the
smell
is
blueberry
and
cocoa
first
followed
by
toasted
malts
and
hop
smells
it
tells
you
this
is
going
to
be
a
differentgood
stout
the
taste
is
not
of
strong
blueberry
just
a
hint
great
with
toasted
biscuit
coffee
malt
chocolate
and
cream
tastes
yum
the
mouth
feel
fills
the
tongue
nose
and
stomach
with
a
superb
flavor
this
is
a
very
good
stout
easy
drinking
and
low
abv
for
the
style
for
me
and
a
great
offering
from
dark
horse
btw
2
of
my
new
favorite
breweries
are
from
michigan
founders
and
now
dark

oh
and
lets
not
forget
bells
a
poured
like
oil
only
the
slightest
hint

passes
through
at
the
edge
definite
undertones
of
blue
nice
cream

an
intense
aroma

that
of
an
imperial
stout
with
very
obvious
blueberries
enticing
signs
of
espresso
and
molasses
mixed
what
appears
to
some
generous
hops
4

t
quite
a
clash
of
flavors
large
as
a
result
of
the
blueberries
which
play
a
dominant
role

d
my
second
brew
from
dark
horse
and
like
the
first
this
beer
excels
an
extreme
beer
packed
with
flavor
and
well
suited
as
an
after
dinner
drink
4
25
d
quite
drinkable
i
was
a
little
bit
skeptical
of
this
one
and
wasnt
quite
willing
to
go
after
the
4pack
but
was
lucky
enough
to
see
a
single
of
this
this
will
definitely
be
a
yearly
purchase
d
good
but
not
something
that
i
would
really
buy
over
anything
else
there
is
not
enough
blueberry
in
it
to
make
me
want
it
more
than
a
blueberry
ale
and
the
stout
is
on
par
with
many
others
available
good
worth
the
try
but
i
wont
be
getting
a
sixer
had
it
after
a
year
of
cellaring
at
first
doughier
makes
way
for
a
wonderful
body
blueberry
is
still
there
but
at
first
masked
by
the
yeastiness
once
it
opened
up
quite
better
earthier
a
thicker
wall
of
stout
oozing
down
the
side
of
the
pint
glass
wonderful
job
d
the
blueberry
is
here
but
it
seems
a
bit
artificial
what
i
really
like
though
are
the
roasty
and
sweet
flavors
i
think
if
you
took
the
blueberry
out
this
would
be
one
hell
of
an
irish
dry
stout
the
problem
of
course
being
this
beer
is
a
blueberry
stout
and
it
doesnt
execute
as
well
as
it
does
in
other
places
dquite
high
although
i
was
nervous
for
a
blueberry
brew
i
am
quite
pleased
smooth
and
blanced
fruit
flavor
add
to
instead
of
overwhelms
the
big
stout
flavor
drinkability
i
would
probably
purchase
this
again
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
though
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
at
the
very
least
worth
a
try
d
its
nice
to
see
a
stout
have
an
interesting
taste
and
be
this
low
in
alcohol
this
is
something
i
could
have
several
of
in
an
evening
i
was
a
little
worried
about
the
idea
of
a
blueberry
infused
stout
but
it
came
out
really
well
winter
is
definitely
the
best
time
of
year
for
dark
horse
pours
a
nice
pitch
black
body
with
an
espresso
colored
head
thats
not
too
big
and
finishes
down
nice
and
lacy
smells
like
blueberry
and
malt
smell
not
to
overpowering
just
right
actually
on
first
taste
i
could
not
help
but
notice
how
smooth
it
went
down
about
the
smoothest
stout
i
have
ever
had
on
first
taste
to
be
honest
on
a
second
taste
the
blueberry
really
comes
out
and
as
the
beer
warms
it
becomes
more
pronounced
probably
the
best
session
stout
i
have
ever
had
nice
and
smooth
feel
tastes
great
and
is
highly
drinkable
1st
rate
stout
what
an
incredible
pour
into
my
sam
adams
sensory
glass
delicious
smell
of
blueberries
the
appearance
was
remarkable
as
it
looked
like
blueberry
pancake
mix
poured
onto
a
hot
griddle
with
big
globlike
bubbles
popping
all
over
a
two
inch
purplish
head
so
it
goes
without
saying
perfect
5s
for
both
appearance
and
taste
taste
started
out
with
a
tinge
of
blueberries
with
a
burnt
stout
overtone
very
tasty
thick
taste
sticks
to
your
teeth
you
have
to
use
your
tongue
to
clean
off
your
teeth
its
that
thick
scrumptious
good
mouthful
is
exceptional
and
thus
the
drinkability
is
very
high
too
im
sorry
i
only
picked
up
a
4
pack
at
the
liquor
stop
in
highland
in
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
great

fruit
stout
but
will
for
sure
not
be
my
last
dark
horse
has
come
up
with
a
great
combination
of
flavors
that
come
together
nicely
id
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
my
stout
drinking
friends
a
good
stout
and
my
notes
would
be
more
positive
if
i
went
into
it
with
the
realization
that
it
was
based
on
a
4
5
american
stout
ratings
adjusted
accordingly
overall
i
was
not
the
least
bit
disappointed
in
this
beer
has
a
definite
natural
blueberry
character
that
mixes
with
the
dark
malts
beautifully
very
drinkable
but
think
this
beer
would
benefit
from
being
on
cask
great
beer
looking
forward
to
the
other
three
another
great
offering
from
dark
horse
thick
and
rich
tasty
treat
all
the
way
around
man
would
be
nice
to
know
the
abv
im
guessing
78
it
packs
some
ass
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
but
no
hint
all
though
out
unfortunately
the
taste
of
brew
is
essential
for
drinkablility
in
my
opinion
therefore
i
gonna
leave
this
brew
at
average
but
because
of
the
unique
qualities
this
brew
has
i
will
recommend
my
pals
give
one
a
sip
splendid
stuff
pretty
tasty
but
as
with
most
blueberry
beers
the
blueberry
is
way
subdued
the
base
beer
is
substantial
and
enjoyable
on
its
own
mouthfeel
is
sweet
bitter
roasty
drinks
nicely
and
is
a
good
take
on
a
fruity
stout
i
am
normally
not
a
big
fan
of
blueberries
in
general
but
this
beer
is
very
good
i
was
expecting
an
fruitier
beer
instead
the
stout
style
came
through
nicely
d
a
tad
harsh
in
my
opinion
but
overall
pretty
good
nice
session
stout
and
the
fruit
helps
it
stand
out
as
well
overall
an
interesting
beer
the
aroma
is
very
misleading
but
i
think
thats
a
good
thing
as
i
wouldnt
want
a
beer
to
taste
like
a
blueberry
muffin
that
being
said
i
think
a
little
more
malt
sweetness
would
bring
out
a
little
raspberry
flavor
which
would
be
sufficiently
balanced
by
the
roast
malts
this
beer
pours
jet
black
with
a
3
fingered
brown
head
with
some
lacing
i
was
suprised
to
see
a
4
5
beer
with
such
a
dark
head
and
i
was
excited
to
taste
this
beer
has
a
very
large
nose
with
tons
of
blueberry
and
some
carmel
notes
basically
it
smells
like
a
blueberry
pietart
the
taste
as
well
is
very
well
composed
with
a
nice
amount
of
blueberries
and
a
nice
dark
malt
base
i
would
imagine
this
beer
has
a
much
higher
of
dark
malts
compared
to
other
american
stouts
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
little
oily
and
the
carbonation
level
seems
nice
a
highly
drinkable
brew
i
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
a
few
more
on
my
next
trip
to
michigan
the
blueberry
nose
on
this
one
should
be
envied
by
every
other
blueberry
stout
attempt
out
there
not
the
first
time
i
have
been
lucky
in
ct
to
have
this
first
review
of
it
though
thanks
noreaster
quite
honestly
this
is
an
easy
drinking
stout
with
a
blueberry
kick
like
a
swift
jab
in
the
face
of
blueberry
with
chocolate
goodness
to
boot
this
beer
manages
to
pair
a
decent
stout
with
an
amazing
blueberry
enhancement
worth
a
try
i
promise
buckeyesox
provided
the
bottle
and
while
ive
previously
passed
over
this
in
stores
in
mi
i
will
start
buying
it
on
future
trips
this
is
very
good
drinkability
darn
tasty
stout
that
is
a
really
cool
change
of
pace
the
blueberry
isnt
something
you
find
every
day
in
a
stout
and
its
more
than
interesting
dark
horse
has
the
stout
thing
down
except
for
the
mouthfeel
they
need
to
beef
that
up
and
this
is
another
winner
in
my
book
d
my
glass
is
disappearing
fast
and
this
is
one
drinkable
beer
glad
i
have
another
poured
into
a
pint
glass
opaque
black
with
a
graham
cracker
colored
head
that
retained
well
smells
of
chocolate
coffee
blueberry
and
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
predominately
that
of
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
the
blueberry
having
faded
a
bit
this
is
from
last
years
batch
but
still
noticable
the
fruit
gives
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
feel
is
a
bit
creamy
and
sticky
coating
the
roof
my
mouth
and
back
of
my
throat
slightly
a
delicious
stout
with
a
moderate
abv
makes
this
one
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
regularly
and
in
succession
drinkability
this
is
s
creative
treat
and
i
wish
i
had
tasted
it
a
week
ago
as
i
was
at
a
dogfish
head
beer
dinner
in
richmond
and
the
couple
sitting
next
to
me
was
trying
to
think
of
a
good
blueberry
beer
i
had
no
answer
then
but
i
do
now
i
only
wish
it
were
not
quite
so
sweet
a
little
messy
around
the
edges
and
maybe
the
blueberry
doesnt
mingle
as
well
as
id
hoped
but
ultimately
this
is
delightful
enough
and
burp
it
upthe
blueberry
comes
back
to
haunt
note
for
12008
tasting
as
i
drink
this
fresh
from
this
years
batch
i
cant
help
but
notice
that
the
blueberry
flavor
is
less
than
when
i
had
it
with
several
months
age
on
it
last
year
this
is
the
last
of
the
stout
series
for
me
and
this
one
pours
just
like
the
rest
pitch
black
with
a
bubbly
mocha
head
that
dissipates
to
a
ring
there
is
little
lacing
but
lots
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
middle
throughout
aroma
is
surprising
for
a
stout
as
it
smells
like
a
blueberry
cobbler
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
thrown
in
fascinating
smell
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
nice
as
the
aroma
but
still
good
with
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
bittersweet
chocolates
dominating
the
blueberries
are
present
but
not
overwhelming
making
for
a
nice
balanced
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
tons
of
carbonation
and
leaves
the
palate
tingling
this
is
right
up
there
with
plead
the
5th
in
the
series
and
this
one
may
win
for
originality
great
beer
overall
an
interesting
beer
not
particulary
sessionable
but
good
in
small
quantities
nicely
done
i
certainly
liked
this
one
more
than
i
was
expecting
and
the
more
i
drank
the
more
interesting
it
became
d
excellent
and
adventuresome
offering
from
what
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
there
is
nothing
else
like
this
on
the
market
to
my
knowledge
good
good
stuff
not
a
session
beer
though
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
it
would
be
a
good
dessert
beer
i
think
i
might
have
to
get
some
of
it
for
the
colder
months
thanks
to
brewandbbq
for
the
chance
to
enjoy
this
one
ive
sampled
this
from
the
bottle
quite
a
few
times
and
enjoyed
every
single
bottle
this
is
my
first
experience
on
tap
and
its
damn
tasty
blueberry
stout
is
a
beer
i
would
love
to
see
more
of
the
flavors
seem
to
go
together
perfectly
and
dark
horse
did
a
great
job
putting
this
one
together
the
idea
of
a
blueberry
stout
lowered
my
expectations
but
overall
it
was
great
who
would
have
thought
what
a
nice
dessert
beer
even
without
tasting
much
alcohol
i
would
have
guessed
it
was
at
least
7
based
on
the
thickness
and
rich
flavor
the
fact
that
it
is
only
4
5
is
amazing
i
would
like
to
have
more
of
this
now
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
all
id
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
brew
pours
midnight
black
with
a
great
mochacolored
head
that
settles
into
a
good
ring
around
the
glass
with
some
decent
lacing
smells
like
a
blueberry
stout
how
about
that
blueberry
smell
up
front
some
dark
and
roasty
malt
notes
maybe
a
touch
of
bitter
chocolate
the
blueberry
taste
is
just
right
kind
of
gets
you
on
the
back
and
sides
of
the
tongue
slight
burnt
taste
through
the
middle
and
a
pretty
noticeable
hop
presence
nice
rounded
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
lively
but
it
keeps
things
from
becoming
too
syrupysweet
never
had
anything
like
this
and
certainly
a
tasty
brew
if
willy
wonka
brewed
beer
this
is
one
he
would
approve
of
dreally
nice
not
as
sweet
as
one
would
think
as
the
chocolateespresso
components
really
mellow
out
the
blueberry
sweetness
a
very
nicely
done
fruited
stout
notes
funny
story
i
had
what
i
thought
was
a
bottle
of
this
in
my
cellar
after
i
managed
to
find
some
more
the
other
day
i
cleaned
out
my
cellar
only
to
discover
i
had
a
bottle
of
dark
horse
too
and
absolutely
none
of
this
it
was
a
brew
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
and
id
have
been
very
dissapointed
to
discover
that
i
didnt
have
any
thanks
to
sprinke
for
the
extra
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
going
in
pours
an
opaque
black
with
nice
head
big
time
blueberry
in
the
nose
tastes
definitely
blueberry
with
a
nice
american
stout
hiding
underneath
very
balanced
and
not
too
bitter
hint
of
smoke
and
roasted
malt
comes
through
overall
i
think
it
was
a
great
base
stout
that
they
just
added
the
blueberry
to
somehow
nice
full
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
highly
enjoyed
thanks
to
iceicebaby
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
served
in
a
nonic
poured
an
opaque
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
expressed
during
the
pour
and
with
each
tilt
of
the
glass
halfinch
mochacolored
head
dissipated
within
seconds
into
a
thin
oily
slick
zero
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
scent
of
blueberry
syrup
dominates
with
just
a
subtle
suggestion
of
chocolate
in
the
background
blueberry
flavoring
is
significantly
masked
by
a
strong
malt
presence
in
addition
to
a
wellbalanced
chocolate
and
coffee
character
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
starts
off
slightly
viscous
at
the
front
but
a
light
carbonation
balances
it
out
at
the
finish
drinkability
is
outstanding
this
brew
went
down
easy
and
left
me
wanting
for
more
excellent
offering
from
dark
horse
pours
an
inky
black
with
almost
no
head
burnt
orange
and
tan
where
it
exists
though
very
little
lacing
smells
of
fresh
blueberries
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
cappuccino
tastes
of
a
blueberry
explosion
up
front
followed
by
a
smooth
chocolate
middle
and
a
mellow
coffee
finish
medium
to
medium
full
in
body
low
in
carbonation
and
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
nice
unique
blueberry
twist
that
is
very
easy
to
detect
but
not
detracting
of
the
other
flavors
a
very
different
and
tasty
stout
very
dessertlike
as
if
you
dipped
a
blueberry
in
some
chocolate
fondue
and
chased
it
with
a
sip
of
cappuccino
very
creamy
and
delicious
im
impressed
pours
very
dark
and
thick
with
a
thin
beige
head
a
nice
roasted
aroma
with
blueberries
standing
out
blueberry
touches
the
tongue
but
does
not
dominate
the
overall
flavor
finishes
with
some
coffee
characteristics
a
mediumbodied
stout
that
is
surprisingly
good
for
a
fruitflavored
beer
d
this
is
an
awesome
brew
because
its
so
unique
yet
appetizing
blueberry
stout
awesome
had
this
on
tap
at
hop
devil
in
nyc
and
was
even
better
however
the
bottle
does
not
disappoint
could
take
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
love
it
not
certain
id
run
out
to
get
more
but
definitely
interesting
to
try
very
unique
tasted
on
4508
beer
level
seemed
too
low
in
the
bottle
almost
all
the
way
down
to
the
shoulder
of
the
longneck
bottle
but
the
beer
didnt
seem
to
suffer
at
all
surprisingly
i
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
maybe
maybe
not
im
impressed
with
the
dark
horse
beers
ive
had
to
date
will
be
seeking
out
more
of
them
this
beer
pours
motor
oil
black
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
blueishtan
unlit
now
i
had
never
known
blueishtan
was
a
color
in
color
and
recedes
very
quickly
into
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
fresh
blueberries
with
underlying
roasted
malt
and
graham
cracker
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
blueberries
and
has
a
graham
cracker
and
vanilla
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
like
how
the
blueberry
is
perfectly
balanced
into
the
stout
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
thanks
to
autumnaldave
for
this
bonus
bottle
this
pours
practically
black
with
a
very
dark
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
blueberry
molasses
and
surprisingly
alcohol
tiny
bit
of
chocolate
coming
through
as
it
warms
diving
in
theres
clearly
a
solid
dry
stout
flavor
profile
here
roasty
coffee
chocolate
slight
nuttiness
and
faint
oak
bitterness
but
the
blueberry
sweetness
is
just
derailing
it
for
me
it
just
dosent
mesh
liking
the
dry
finish
but
it
clashes
a
bit
with
the
lingering
increasingly
cloying
fruit
bitterness
leaves
off
with
a
strange
herbal
twang
very
thin
mouthfeel
heavily
carbonated
same
sort
of
seltzerlike
quality
i
noted
in
double
crooked
tree
could
use
a
bit
more
body
maybe
an
oatmeal
version
and
maybe
dialing
back
the
bitterdryness
novel
effort
but
id
much
rather
drink
the
clearly
quite
good
plain
old
stout
here
thats
been
dressed
up
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
pours
and
looks
like
motor
oil
with
a
thin
creamy
looking
mocha
colored
head
the
nose
has
a
nice
wiff
of
blueberries
on
first
smell
and
a
deeper
examination
reveals
subtle
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
taste
is
nice
an
intro
to
sweet
blueberry
followed
by
the
finish
of
a
dry
stout
coffee
being
prevalent
the
mouthfeel
is
viscous
and
very
lightly
carbonated
drinkability
is
a
little
lacking
in
my
opinion
interesting
brew
but
not
one
i
could
session
a
very
nicely
crafted
beer
well
balanced
and
not
overly
sweet
i
would
like
to
track
down
some
more
beers
from
dark
horse
generally
iwe
like
it
im
not
a
stout
fan
like
my
wife
but
this
is
a
better
crafted
option
all
in
all
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
one
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
the
blueberry
aroma
and
flavor
keeps
it
from
being
too
overpowering
as
a
big
stout
i
could
easily
put
a
few
of
these
babys
away
in
one
sitting
delicious
do
you
like
blueberry
muffins
dipped
in
stout
i
do
overall
i
thought
this
was
excellent
and
was
easily
my
favorite
among
all
of
the
ones
that
i
had
before
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
as
i
am
sure
it
would
be
outstanding
if
you
can
get
this
it
is
a
must
try
one
of
the
best
and
most
unique
stouts
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
pours
dark
oily
black
with
a
medium
sized
nice
and
dark
brown
head
smell
definitely
has
some
blueberry
as
well
as
some
rich
chocolately
slightly
sweet
creamy
roastiness
taste
is
dark
roasty
and
blueberries
as
advertised
very
drinkable
and
chocolately
much
like
dark
chocolate
covered
dried
blueberries
really
nice
slightly
sweet
but
not
overly
so
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
and
my
favorite
dark
horse
beer
so
far
wish
i
had
more
of
this
overall
not
a
bad
beer
a
departure
from
the
norm
and
good
for
a
change
of
pace
its
not
something
id
buy
regularly
but
its
rotation
and
rarity
make
it
impossible
to
do
so
as
it
is
as
this
tasting
was
on
tap
i
will
add
an
addendum
to
this
review
once
i
get
to
the
bottle
that
is
currently
in
my
fridge
drinkability
its
actually
pretty
nice
the
flavors
contrast
and
complement
each
other
quite
well
d
not
a
bad
beer
the
first
i
have
had
from
dark
horse
and
it
did
not
disapoint
cant
wait
to
find
more
of
these
awesome
beers
while
i
am
not
a
fruit
beer
nut
i
do
enjoy
a
well
crafted
one
dark
horse
gets
it
right
here
with
a
great
balance
of
sweet
to
roast
and
enough
blueberry
to
go
around
with
out
being
overkill
in
sum
this
is
worth
trying
not
just
for
the
novelty
but
for
the
true
unique
effort
to
pull
off
this
beer
id
put
this
near
the
bottom
of
dhs
stout
series
above
the
oatmeal
which
tastes
sour
and
off
but
under
the
fabulous
smoked
and
cream
stouts
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
chewy
very
nice
for
a
dry
stout
blueberry
isnt
sweet
at
all
this
is
just
a
very
well
done
beer
a
very
interesting
stout
blueberry
complements
the
hearty
stout
character
unusual
and
very
interesting
flavor
pick
this
one
up
if
you
get
the
chance
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
a
unique
and
tasty
fruit
stout
combination
i
wish
i
knew
what
tha
abv
was
since
this
didnt
have
the
characteristics
of
an
imperial
stout
or
even
something
closer
to
guinness
no
matter
im
glad
i
tried
this
and
i
like
the
pairing
of
blueberry
with
a
style
such
as
this
one
could
call
this
a
dark
horse
of
sorts
but
i
dont
think
thats
the
case
if
somewhere
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
serves
this
so
dark
that
you
cant
see
through
the
pour
yields
better
than
a
full
finger
foamy
dark
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
leaving
spotty
lacing
patterns
hey
guess
what
it
smells
like
no
seriously
it
starts
out
with
a
distinct
celebration
of
blueberries
then
settles
out
to
a
lowroasted
chocolate
stout
that
sells
its
edge
to
the
berry
blueberrys
arent
naturally
very
fragrant
this
bottle
has
a
residue
on
the
lip
that
picks
up
berryroast
combo
as
a
muffinlike
aroma
lightly
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
rich
and
tingles
nicely
in
a
medium
body
the
flavor
is
really
nice
too
a
solid
stout
character
that
trades
what
might
have
been
a
modestly
roasted
chocolate
flavor
with
that
of
the
healthy
blueberry
the
berry
taste
isnt
a
big
blast
but
it
lingers
long
enough
to
be
considered
well
its
really
a
cinch
to
drink
a
little
warming
on
the
way
down
but
otherwise
well
integrated
this
one
scores
maximum
points
for
imagination
besides
the
new
glarus
products
this
dark
horse
is
one
of
the
first
fruitvegetable
beers
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
stick
in
my
grocery
cart
thanks
bigdaddywil
for
the
opportunity
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
at
once
if
i
was
having
dessert
or
something
but
after
that
it
would
be
too
much
very
nice
though
would
welcome
these
any
time
in
my
house
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
but
it
is
warming
going
down
as
well
if
i
had
to
guess
id
go
in
the
78
range
tasting
this
beer
is
where
its
at
the
real
flavors
come
out
i
tasted
strong
chocolate
and
coffee
but
to
me
these
tastes
didnt
blend
well
with
the
blueberry
slighty
carbonated
at
the
end
with
a
fruity
aftertaste
that
mixes
with
java
it
has
a
thick
mouthfeel
that
envelopes
your
tastebuds
i
would
drink
this
again
but
id
be
inclined
to
try
something
new
before
ordering
this
again
thanks
to
hoppymeal
and
seaoflament
for
an
extra
each
of
this
pours
to
perfect
beauty
with
a
inky
black
body
hosting
a
coco
powder
colored
head
at
two
fingers
with
decent
retention
nose
is
a
welcome
mix
of
opening
the
bread
box
to
blueberry
muffins
and
zesty
spicey
malt
this
beer
comes
into
the
mouth
shockingly
smooth
like
a
chocolate
covered
blue
berry
malty
dark
chocolate
richness
is
created
by
the
burnt
malt
the
blueberries
add
a
slight
sweet
sour
feel
happens
on
the
mouthfeel
a
dark
chocolate
bon
bon
effect
is
all
over
the
palate
also
overall
they
did
a
great
job
integratin
the
blueberries
without
making
it
seperate
wonderfully
drinkable
solid
beer
d
very
good
beer
back
to
back
drinking
could
come
too
easily
edit
0408
just
drank
2
of
these
from
the
latest
release
and
it
holds
up
well
after
a
year
this
beer
is
inky
black
with
what
i
swear
is
a
little
bit
of
purple
foam
on
top
the
aroma
is
of
tons
of
blueberries
covered
in
dark
chocolate
covered
with
ground
espresso
beans
i
think
that
is
pretty
much
how
the
beer
tastes
as
well
this
beer
is
everything
a
stout
should
be
very
dark
with
a
heavy
roasted
malt
character
and
an
acrid
bitterness
with
the
added
and
welcome
addition
sweetaromatic
blueberries
the
only
real
flaw
i
see
in
this
beer
is
its
dissapointing
lack
of
a
thick
creamy
head
otherwise
if
blueberry
stout
is
what
youre
lookin
for
its
right
here
d
this
wasnt
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewery
i
could
see
how
some
like
it
but
it
didnt
suit
me
drinkability
is
ok
not
really
into
blueberries
but
this
is
not
bad
worth
a
try
certainly
want
to
thank
merlin48
for
this
one
pours
a
complete
old
motor
oil
black
with
a
dark
brown
one
finger
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
stickiness
is
here
and
there
a
bit
spotty
smell
is
dark
chocolate
covered
blueberries
with
a
hint
of
fresh
roasted
coffee
some
woody
vanilla
notes
tingle
the
nose
as
well
with
bit
of
caramel
malt
taste
starts
off
with
a
tiny
bit
of
fresh
blueberries
which
is
quickly
dominated
by
the
big
french
roast
coffee
flavor
a
bit
of
an
oaky
wood
taste
towards
the
end
with
some
grassy
hop
flavors
as
well
i
was
hoping
for
just
a
bit
more
blueberry
sweetness
on
the
tongue
with
this
one
but
still
a
decent
taste
overall
mouthfeel
is
a
creamy
medium
body
with
a
mild
carbonation
bite
very
enjoyable
beer
over
all
i
wish
more
breweries
would
experiment
fruit
stouts
tres
blueberry
stout
carries
this
combination
off
very
well
with
a
perfect
blending
of
chocolates
and
blueberries
nothing
fights
everything
harmonizes

with
a
small
deep
brown

aroma
of
strong
blueberry
is
well
mix
with
some

notes
taste
is
a
mix
between
fresh
and
sweet
blueberry
and
some
roasted
malt
with
a
light
bitter
finish
i
am
not
usually
fond
of
fruit
in
stout
but
i
thought
this
mix
worked
very
well
and
the
balance
between
fruit
sweetness
and
bitterness
from
the
malt
was
well
achieved
body
was
quite
full
with
some
light
carbonation
i
will
search
more
of
this
one
out
it
was
not
fresh
hopefully
a
fresh
batch
will
have
a
bit
more
blueberry
taste
i
only
wish
i
could
buy
this
in
chicago
i
feared
the
blueberry
stout
would
be
just
a
gimmick
but
it
paid
off
quite
nicely
im
a
huge
fan
of
dark
horses
holiday
stout
series
its
too
bad
that
i
only
have
one
more
to
go
tres
blueberry
stout
is
a
delicious
marriage
of
fruit
and
roasted
barley
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
see
this
stuff
on
the
shelves
dont
hesitate
tres
is
tres
magnifique
sometimes
fancy
shit
like
this
works
out
this
is
a
sometime
overall
impression
one
of
the
best
fruit
stouts
ive
had
i
love
the
background
blueberry
notes
with
the
stout
profile
shining
strong
all
other
brewers
should
take
notes
on
this
one
strongly
recommended
very
fine
looking
beer
black
body
thick
crop
of
deep
brown
froth
to
cap
it
off
lacing
is
quite
nice
bountiful
nice
aroma
plump
sweet
blueberries
contrast
with
the
gritty
and
roasty
black
malts
of
this
stout
this
beer
is
about
80
stout
20
fruit
which
is
good
it
works
the
main
gist
of
the
of
the
flavor
is
deep
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
nice
burnt
edge
to
it
and
the
sugar
coated
blueberries
give
a
ghostly
presence
in
the
background
the
creamy
mouthfeel
lends
to
a
very
drinkable
stout
this
is
good
beautiful
smooth
creamy
black
pour
with
a
medium
sized
dark
tan
crown
very
tiny
bubbles
moderate
head
retention
aroma
is
a
huge
blast
of
blueberry
filling
syrup
nothing
more
flavorful
taste
of
chocolate
blueberry
blended
nicely
with
some
roastyness
towards
the
back
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
a
very
delicious
dessert
beer
good
to
enjoy
slowly
but
may
not
want
more
than
one
in
a
row
pours
a
very
opaque

almost
purple
they
must
have
used
a
shitload
of
blueberries

to
the

thanks
for
sharing
jan
d
well
i
dont
know
if
this
may
have
been
a
tad
off
or
what
either
way
the
bottle
that
i
have
is
not
too
great
imo
not
a
drainpour
but
a
definite
no
thanks
in
the
future
overall
if
there
were
points
for
originality
and
creativity
this
beer
would
get
a
5
one
of
the
more
memorable
beers
ive
tried
and
good
choice
for
something
different
full
bodied
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
finely
crafted
stout
with
a
nice
fruit
addition
inky
oily
black
body
with
a
small
but
persistent
cocoa
brown
head
wheres
the
blue
just
kidding
intriguing
nose
of
crushed
blueberries
flowers
espresso
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
very
unique
aroma
created
by
the
floral
blueberry
aroma
and
the
roasted
coffeemalt
and
its
good
taste
starts
out
nice
and
roasty
rich
roasted
coffee
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
work
nicely
together
hints
of
floral
fruitiness
soon
become
stronger
with
noticeable
blueberry
essence
midpalate
strong
coffee
bitterness
baking
chocolate
and
slight
roasted
grain
astringency
in
the
finish
slightly
warming
mediumbodied
could
be
a
bit
fuller
imo
with
a
dry
slightly
metallic
finish
darkhorse
pulled
this
one
off
nicely
i
was
leary
at
first
but
i
might
just
have
to
buy
more
of
this
now
it
was
a
dark
black
color
completely
opaque
head
was
nudepantyhose
tan
with
a
hint
of
blue
in
some
of
the
larger
bubbles
aroma
was
toasted
malt
and
blueberries
taste
is
a
decent
amount
of
burned
pizza
crust
which
i
dig
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
blueberry
flavor
i
wouldnt
think
fruitiness
and
toastiness
would
play
well
together
yet
they
do
mouthfeel
is
quite
dry
and
good
definitely
recommended

very
interesting
but
it
works
quite
well
the
blueberry
flavor
is
subtle
and
integrates
very
well
into
the
stouts
roasty
character
an
excellent
fruit
stout
glad
i
tried
it
dark
horses
tres
blueberry
stout
is
an
interesting
seesaw
of
a
beer
hitting
you
upfront
with
a
sweetish
and
somewhat
tart
blueberry
flavor
and
aroma
theres
less
in
the
aroma
than
the
flavor
and
then
turning
spotonadime
and
hammering
home
dark
rich
malts
with
a
solid
bitterness
and
roasted
character
the
fruitiness
helps
to
cut
through
it
and
keep
it
refreshing
or
at
least
interesting
while
the
blunt
darkness
of
the
endside
offers
it
great
depth
some
grassy
leafy
hops
flutter
here
and
there
in
the
finish
and
theres
an
edge
of
black
coffee
acrid
character
but
its
not
acidic
as
many
beers
this
dark
can
be
and
dark
bittersweet
chocolate
but
very
little
blueberry
odd
its
an
unusual
combination
that
works
and
although
ive
seen
this
done
with
raspberry
and
cherry
i
think
that
the
blueberry
might
be
a
better
or
at
least
more
distinct
choice
because
it
stands
out
so
readily
and
of
course
were
talking
about
extract
here
but
it
really
makes
no
difference
it
does
the
job
and
its
done
nicely
in
fact
you
couldnt
do
it
with
real
blueberries
they
just
wouldnt
cut
it
theyd
ferment
through
and
leave
too
little
behind
and
more
of
a
fruitpulp
character
than
any
recognizable
blueberry
as
for
drinkablility
however
im
not
sure
the
playfulness
and
teetertotter
gentility
of
this
beer
could
keep
up
beyond
one
serving
its
very
well
done
and
interesting
but
i
think
id
have
to
move
on
after
one
or
two
of
these
certainly
worth
trying
however
another
fine
brew
from
the
folks
at
dark
horse
d
there
is
not
much
depth
or
complexity
to
this
beer
and
the
odd
flavor
of
blueberries
taste
more
like
an
off
flavor
that
a
compliment
to
the
stout
it
poured
a
opauqe
dark
color
with
a
brownviolet
head
that
disappeared
quickly
i
could
smell
the
blueberries
as
it
was
being
handed
to
me
what
a
treat
the
taste
was
of
chocolate
blueberries
vanilla
and
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
thick
and
slightly
carbonated
i
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
wonderful
fruit
stout
i
would
recommend
seaking
this
out
i
have
also
tried
the
bottled
version
and
it
is
very
similar
d
sweet
wins
over
bitter
for
this
stout
making
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
nice
in
the
mouth
i
really
enjoy
the
subtle
but
persistant
carbonation
almost
by
definition
i
dont
think
youd
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
time
but
this
is
a
very
creative
beer
and
easy
to
enjoy
im
very
new
to
dark
horse
brewing
co
but
thanks
to
my
friend
dan
from
michigan
im
getting
the
opportunity
to
sample
some
of
these
wondrous
brews
seek
them
out
many
thanks
to
patyoda
for
sending
me
this
delicious
and
unique
beer
i
had
looked
forward
to
sampling
this
the
most
out
of
the
dark
horse
stout
series
it
did
not
disappoint
pours
black
with
a
short
lived
brown
tan
head
that
fizzled
to
nothing
i
guess
i
expected
that
beautiful
head
to
last
a
little
longer
anyway
the
aroma
consists
of
chocolate
and
fresh
blueberry
skins
the
taste
has
a
lush
blueberry
taste
to
it
blended
with
a
rich
stout
flavor
the
blueberry
is
fresh
and
real
not
at
all
like
a
concentrate
or
syrup
it
reminded
me
of
the
jersey
blueberries
we
pick
in
summer
while
visiting
my
wifes
grandma
in
indiana
the
blueberry
taste
is
definitely
featured
here
in
the
stout
and
is
done
without
comprising
the
stout
characteristics
of
the
beer
powdery
dry
finish
to
wrap
things
up
very
unique
and
if
youre
a
fan
of
blueberries
this
is
a
musttry
the
flavor
is
very
rich
and
malty
solid
and
roasty
good
carmelized
malt
with
a
solid
blueberry
flavor
but
not
iver
powering
very
balanced
beer
pours
an
opaque
brownblack
with
a
thin
dark
brown
head
looks
nice
not
very
many
bubbles
smells
very
good
fresh
blueberries
and
roasted
malts
nice
and
smoky
taste
is
very
aggressive
and
acidic
heavy
on
malts
and
acrid
blueberry
way
too
tart
not
sweet
at
all
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
average
d
like
kidadam
says
below
i
could
easily
finish
off
a
six
pack
of
these
it
is
that
good
great
balance
between
the
bitter
chocolate
smooth
oats
and
slightly
tart
blueberries
i
was
afraid
that
this
might
taste
cloying
and
phony
one
sip
was
all
it
took
to
allay
my
fears
this
is
a
superb
fruit
stout
d
a
very
nice
brew
the
blueberry
is
a
great
compliment
to
the
stout
and
not
too
sweet
i
have
had
several
on
tap
lately
and
remember
them
being
better
than
this
bottle
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
one
on
tap
again
d
fantastic
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
i
would
guess
that
it
is
about
67
abv
only
a
little
strong
for
sessioning
this
is
a
stout
first
and
a
fruit
beer
second
the
blueberry
aspects
are
subtle
and
give
a
unique
twist
on
what
would
otherwise
be
only
a
damn
good
stout
this
years
tres
just
arrived
in
south
bend
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
go
poured
super
dark
and
greatlooking
dark
brown
head
tremendous
lacing
make
this
look
like
a
super
good
beer
blueberry
is
really
big
on
the
nose
and
underneath
is
a
bitter
burnt
grain
odor
that
i
expect
from
nice
bitter
stouts
do
they
meld
well
kind
of
i
can
smell
the
blueberry
from
three
feet
away
which
is
interesting
taste
is
pretty
interesting
too
and
it
has
3
stages
first
its
just
a
blast
of
heavy
blueberry
juice
then
you
get
the
burnt
roasted
malt
of
the
stout
and
then
the
finish
is
a
nice
blend
of
the
two
the
blueberry
falls
more
into
the
background
as
i
drink
more
and
its
more
of
just
a
good
stout
full
nicely
put
together
beer
not
a
great
drinkin
swiggin
beer
but
its
made
well
and
interesting
to
drink
i
might
even
buy
it
again
although
im
much
more
likely
to
buy
the
other
3
stouts
from
dh
is
i
see
them
soon
unfortunately
the
beer
is
downhill
from
smell
simple
roasted
malt
with
a
heavy
dose
of
blueberries
black
currant
dark
chocolate
and
some
herbal
qualities
the
problem
is
this
beer
lacks
depth
super
thin
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
finish
is
not
that
greatly
palatable
worth
a
try
but
not
many
after
that
t
yuck
it
definitely
smelled
like
blueberries
more
than
it
tasted
in
fact
it
almost
had
a
vegetable
taste
to
it
that
i
didnt
find
pleasant
at
all
thankfully
the
roasted
malt
takes
charge
but
still
not
enough
to
mask
the
unpleasantness
of
it
pours
black
with
a
muddy
red
head
bottleconditioned
blueberry
aroma
is
nice
the
sweet
malts
contribute
to
make
it
like
a
blueberry
cobbler
there
is
also
some
roastiness
and
a
colalike
sweetness
the
blueberry
flavor
is
taken
over
pretty
quickly
by
the
roasted
and
smoky
malts
in
the
flavor
although
as
it
rolls
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
little
blueberry
cobbler
and
blueberry
cola
flavors
the
beer
finishes
with
a
tanginess
from
the
malts
and
a
slightly
dry
bitterness
good
stout
i
really
enjoyed
the
blueberry
aroma
but
the
blend
of
stout
and
blueberry
flavors
didnt
do
as
much
for
me
dextrinous
thick
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
an
enjoyable
beer
but
a
bit
dry
happy
to
try
one
bottle
but
glad
i
dont
have
a
6er
overall
despite
the
complexity
very
mild
and
drinkable
if
anything
the
base
stout
is
smooth
with
a
subtle
roast
factor
and
the
berry
complicates
things
is
dark
horse
the
new
kuhnhenn
but
with
better
qc
looks
like
it
this
beer
is
outstanding
and
should
be
heralded
as
such
a
real
achievement
in
brewing
12
oz
bottle
9
oz
sample
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
half
finger
of
brown
head
that
falls
to
just
a
full
coat
over
top
no
light
comes
through
the
brew
and
no
carbonation
is
apparent
no
doubt
about
this
one
being
a
stout
nose
tells
me
that
its
a
blueberry
stout
initial
aromas
are
full
blueberry
almost
like
a
fresh
squezed
berry
hanging
over
a
malty
chocolate
base
with
a
hint
of
coffee
hanging
on
the
end
its
interesting
to
take
a
deep
inhale
and
see
how
it
progressed
from
blueberry
to
stout
over
the
course
of
a
few
seconds
for
what
it
is
supposedto
be
i
have
to
say
the
aroma
really
carries
the
flag
flavor
definately
portrays
both
characteristics
taking
air
over
the
beer
as
its
in
my
mouth
brings
moderate
notes
of
blueberry
that
hang
over
a
nice
base
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roast
swallowing
the
beer
blends
the
blueberry
nicely
with
the
chocolate
and
mocha
notes
on
the
finish
the
roasted
character
really
comes
through
leaving
a
very
mild
bitter
but
not
something
i
would
attribute
to
hops
but
to
the
blueberry
and
coffee
i
enjoy
this
one
even
thought
i
dont
like
blueberry
all
that
much
i
think
it
works
well
in
the
stout
feel
is
nice
and
thick
with
a
very
light
carbonation
i
definately
have
to
say
i
am
surprised
by
this
one
i
obtained
it
because
of
the
novelty
of
having
a
blueberry
stout
but
i
am
more
than
pleased
with
how
enjoyable
this
one
has
been
blueberry
and
stout
are
a
great
combination
who
would
have
thought
pours
pitch
black
but
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
color
of
blueberries
is
evident
how
cool
smells
like
blueberries
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
blueberry
smell
is
nice
but
not
overwhelming
tastes
like
blueberry
coffee
with
a
bit
of
dark
cocoa
mixed
in
enjoyable
but
primarily
a
dessert
or
end
of
the
evening
beer
for
me
little
carbonation
and
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
not
very
pleasant
a
light
thin
for
my
liking
this
is
a
nice
attempt
blueberries
and
coffeechocolate
come
together
nicely
here
black
beer
i
couldnt
even
find
real
highlights
with
a
dense
dark
brown
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
as
well
it
smelled
like
a
combination
of
blueberry
pancakes
and
roastcoffee
like
breakfast
the
blueberries
came
through
in
the
flavour
as
well
along
with
some
chocolate
character
and
a
bitter
roast
in
the
finish
moderate
bitterness
overall
the
body
and
carbonation
were
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
produced
a
slightly
creamy
texture
there
was
a
little
dryness
as
well
i
was
surprised
at
how
well
the
blueberry
flavour
came
through
particularly
with
all
the
dark
malts
different
and
tasty
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
black
as
night
moderately
aromatic
with
notes
of
blueberry
pancakes
coffee
anise
and
chocolate
taste
is
odd
revealing
more
than
twice
its
potency
in
flavor
a
subtle
blueberry
flavor
is
present
but
it
distracts
from
other
flavors
more
than
contributing
a
flavor
notes
of
anise
ginger
strong
coffee
grounds
and
a
hint
of
blueberry
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
very
creamy
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
this
is
just
one
fantastic
gem
of
a
stout
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
between
sweet
maltyness
and
hoppyness
mmmm
aroma
is
a
crusty
baked
blueberry
pie
served
right
next
to
a
steaming
cup
of
quality
roasted
coffee
deep
black
color
in
the
body
with
a
very
dark
brown
pinky
thin
creamy
head
fore
is
roasty
with
chooclate
and
coffee
notes
slightly
bitter
then
the
bluberries
kick
in
toward
the
middle
lots
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
cocoa
and
coffee
flavors
collide
with
the
blueberry
notes
in
the
finish
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
and
it
is
not
lost
in
the
blueberry
notes
its
still
very
much
a
stout
first
drinkability
is
good
based
simply
on
what
this
is
a
blueberry
stout
if
this
had
a
profoundly
delicious
taste
it
would
be
the
ultimate
in
dangerous
the
drinkability
would
be
off
the
hook
this
beer
made
me
skeptical
from
the
jump
but
as
i
started
to
ponder
the
possibilities
it
led
me
to
hope
ultimately
this
brew
was
very
disappointing
so
much
potential
dry
finish
i
love
stouts
and
blueberries
so
i
had
to
give
this
one
a
try
very
dark
black
in
color
with
a
thin
tan
colored
head
that
didnt
last
long
the
best
part
of
this
brew
is
the
smell
lots
of
blueberries
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
the
blueberries
taking
a
backseat
to
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavours
a
mediumheavy
bodied
mouthfeel
not
much
carbonation
i
would
recommend
this
stout
to
anybody
its
worth
a
try
but
not
a
session
brew
orange
chocolate
flavored
stout
would
tastes
like
a
very
well
crafted
crossover
between
a
stout
and
a
fruit
beer
poured
out
to
an
onyx
black
color
with
a
nice
1
inch
brown
foamy
head
medium
low
level
of
carbonation
and
many
rings
of
lace
are
some
of
the
characteristics
that
make
this
brew
very
stout
like
aroma
is
sweet
and
earthy
with
a
powerful
natural
blueberry
aroma
almost
like
blueberry
pancake
syrup
taste
is
very
very
unique
flavors
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
blueberry
are
all
very
present
and
seem
to
work
out
ok
i
give
this
brew
a
4
for
taste
in
the
sense
that
the
flavors
are
there
but
they
dont
mesh
all
that
well
mouthfeel
is
again
very
stout
like
heavy
and
dense
drinkability
is
fair
id
have
this
every
once
in
awhile
but
not
all
that
often
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
compared
to
the
robust
flavor
drinkability
is
good
for
a
nice
roasty
stout
ill
take
a
pass
on
this
one
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
fully
bodied
along
with
the
blueberry
sweetness
lingering
has
a
full
stouty
mouthfeel
however
this
isnt
something
i
would
buy
again
nice
crisp
body
cuts
through
the
richness
of
the
malt
and
keeps
the
beer
on
its
toes
very
nice
bottleconditioned
mouthfeel
the
restraint
of
the
fruitiness
and
the
level
of
integration
make
this
an
easy
one
to
down
great
job
good
for
the
novelty
factor
but
probably
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
weird
labels
great
beer
thats
dark
horse
this
was
an
attractively
alluring
stout
to
behold
a
yummy
treat
that
was
the
perfect
dessert
beer
for
after
dinner
yum
thanks
trbeer
pretty
beer
pitch
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
that
doesnt
fade
immediately
but
doesnt
last
the
bluebeery
aroma
is
nice
and
is
the
first
thing
you
notice
under
that
is
a
bit
of
hop
and
chocolate
the
malts
take
dominance
in
the
flavor
with
chocolate
laying
down
the
foundation
of
the
flavor
with
toast
and
a
little
char
filling
in
the
cracks
the
blueberry
is
there
in
the
flavor
but
not
so
strongly
thanks
to
trbeer
for
the
bottle
a
good
beer
to
have
one
of
but
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
blueberry
and
hence
dont
care
for
the
flavor
much
still
maybe
have
a
single
one
again
in
the
future
it
was
good
interesting
i
had
my
little
pbr
8oz
or
whatever
glass
of
this
during
a
movie
so
it
had
a
chance
to
sit
and
warm
and
change
a
bit
it
was
a
dark
stout
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
it
smelled
like
blueberry
muffins
and
coffee
nice
and
roastytoasty
it
tasted
similar
not
too
much
blueberry
though
more
of
the
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavour
ive
seen
blueberry
muffin
coffee
at
7eleven
but
was
always
afraid
to
try
it
i
think
it
may
be
similar
to
this
beer
the
blueberry
taste
did
shine
through
a
bit
more
as
time
went
on
but
i
think
i
wouldve
liked
more
berries
in
there
mouthfeel
was
ok
maybe
a
little
watery
and
thin
for
a
stout
so
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
id
try
it
again
but
im
not
upset
that
i
dont
have
another
bottle
right
here
and
now
overall
a
decent
beer
with
an
interesting
flavour
opaque
black
with
tan
edges
aromas
of
blueberry
cake
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
hoppy
caramel
taste
is
roasty
toasty
and
sweet
the
blueberry
presence
is
minimal
but
it
is
noticed
more
as
the
brew
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
but
the
drinkability
remains
nice
drinkability
is
decent
but
one
is
enough
ive
never
heard
of
a
blueberry
stout
until
i
saw
this
one
at
my
local
beer
store
it
poured
very
dark
almost
pitch
black
but
not
quite
with
a
weak
dark
head
there
were
some
signs
of
oxidation
which
was
this
beers
main
problem
but
it
was
so
unique
and
tasty
i
didnt
even
have
to
smell
the
beer
the
blueberries
came
out
and
smacked
my
nose
with
a
strongass
scent
the
actual
taste
had
a
lot
of
roastiness
it
actually
was
so
roasty
that
it
was
smoky
blueberry
was
still
prevalent
it
reminded
of
toast
with
blueberry
jam
on
it
tarty
finish
i
need
more
dark
horse
products
quite
amazing
stuff
it
would
earn
a
perfect
score
if
it
gained
some
sort
of
cohesion
or
balance
perhaps
a
lighter
touch
with
the
roasties
would
help
quite
the
little
beer
here
from
dark
horse
neat
bw
label
dark
brownblack
in
color
with
a
deep
tan
porterlike
head
definite
blueberry
aroma
but
mixed
with
a
deep
roasted
aroma
roasted
flavor
hits
the
tongue
first
and
mellows
to
a
nice
chocolateblueberry
flavor
pretty
easy
to
drink
id
certainly
have
this
a
few
more
times
itd
pair
nicely
with
a
chocolate
cake
if
youre
sick
of
your
standard
chocolate
cake
beer
whatever
that
might
be
much
thanks
to
trbeer
for
this
brew
i
have
been
waiting
to
try
this
one
for
awhile
pours
black
with
a
small
tan
head
that
seems
to
last
malt
fruit
blueberry
and
grain
are
what
i
smell
the
taste
is
malt
smoke
blueberry
and
coffee
very
good
but
not
great
the
aftertaste
is
very
much
coffee
and
chocolate
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
some
place
youd
think
that
dark
horse
bc
pays
4th
graders
to
create
their
labels
in
sweatshops
what
appears
to
be
a
mobius
strip
and
either
1
a
rabbit
turd
2
a
red
blood
cell
or
3
a
tomato
adorn
this
label
youd
think
they
would
put
a
blueberry
on
the
oh
wait
nevermind
this
beer
looked
a
little
oily
when
i
was
pouring
so
i
thought
id
try
to
give
it
a
little
head
with
a
vigorous
pour
and
ended
up
with
some
of
it
on
my
countertop
oily
absolutely
ebonyblack
with
a
quickly
thinning
darkbrown
head
resembling
espresso
crema
no
lace
at
all
nada
the
aroma
is
rich
with
darkroasted
grains
dark
coffee
a
sweet
little
tang
of
blueberries
subtle
hops
and
a
wisp
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
moderately
smooth
thick
and
oily
with
a
mediumstrong
body
taste
starts
with
lots
of
darkroasted
malts
followed
by
dark
coffee
and
chocolate
a
metallic
note
a
dry
whisky
character
and
then
giving
way
to
an
unpleasant
alcohol
bite
which
thankfully
only
last
a
short
instance
before
the
nice
finish
with
a
pronounced
nutty
coffeebean
character
the
blueberries
are
only
evident
in
aroma
and
one
is
never
cognizant
of
their
presence
otherwise
the
alcohol
becomes
evident
as
the
brew
warms
taking
on
an
isopropyl
character
and
giving
me
an
odd
sensation
again
dunno
what
the
abv
is
but
it
gives
me
a
wierd
little
buzz
these
guys
seem
to
have
a
way
with
stouts
enjoy
my
personal
favorite
from
atwater
very
silky
smooth
feel
because
of
the
low
carbonation
sweet
dark
chocolate
aromas
make
the
mouth
water
great
taste
from
start
to
finish
your
typical
sweet
not
bitter
dark
chocolate
taste
turns
almost
into
a
root
beerish
middle
and
finishes
smooth
with
more
cocoa
tastes
wonderful
beer
from
a
wonderful
town
overall
i
would
definitely
try
again
a
solid
enjoyable
beer
great
visual
and
aroma
flavor
is
a
little
disappointing
its
not
as
smooth
and
it
lacks
body
however
chocolate
flavor
does
come
through
nicely
in
the
after
taste
look
and
smell
are
excellent
taste
is
disappointing
lacks
depth
and
is
over
carbonated
two
parts
soda
water
and
one
part
hersheys
syrup
about
sums
it
up
just
an
amazing
brew
easy
drinker
i
enjoy
it
but
if
you
dont
like
chocolate
forget
this
beer
o
lots
of
carbonation
almost
like
carbonated
chocolate
drink
with
slight
vodka
burn
off
delicious
chocolate
ale
tastes
like
a
chocolate
bar
if
you
want
a
true
chocolate
stout
this
is
the
one
tons
of
true
chocolate
and
caramel
flavors
coming
though
wonderful
carbonated
yet
creamy
mouthfeel
nice
thin
head
and
lacing
retained
throughout
really
nice
in
a
tulip
glass
on
a
winter
day
will
pick
up
again
when
i
can
find
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
khaki
colored
head
smells
like
a
brownie
or
chocolate
cake
tastes
like
it
too
i
like
o
it
absolutely
delivers
on
the
name
heavy
chocolate
eclipses
most
other
characteristics
as
an
exercise
of
how
to
amplify
chocolate
smells
and
tastes
the
exercise
is
interesting
but
ends
up
feeling
a
bit
onenoted
that
is
a
significant
detraction
for
a
beer
even
with
the
spoton
chocolate
hit
it
delivers
overall
not
too
great
it
has
chocolate
yes
but
thats
about
all
it
has
and
the
mouthbody
and
base
malt
beer
are
just
sooo
thin
and
watery
it
def
could
have
benefited
from
some
oats
or
creamy
feel
in
general
or
even
just
more
body
from
the
malts
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
period
a
must
try
for
chocolate
lovers
great
smell
and
taste
recommend
giving
it
a
try
chocolate
chocolate
chocolate
fun
beer
but
not
sure
i
could
drink
them
all
night
one
of
my
favorite
beers
magical
things
happen
when
you
mix
this
5050
with
their
vanilla
java
porter
tastes
like
ice
cream
mouth
feel
smooth
soft
quite
pleasant
o
a
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
brew
although
perhaps
too
lightweight
to
justify
being
called
decadent
an
enjoyable
holiday
time
andor
colder
weather
beverage
overall
its
a
very
ok
beer
it
isnt
quite
remarkable
in
any
way
and
i
think
youngs
chocolate
stout
beats
this
in
most
categories
even
if
its
a
different
style
if
youre
looking
for
a
chocolate
stout
definitely
go
with
youngs
over
this
one
if
youre
looking
for
something
new
to
try
i
recommend
trying
something
else
if
you
want
to
drink
a
hersheys
bar
this
is
your
beer
very
good
for
a
novelty
drink
super
chocolatey
although
one
of
my
friends
tasted
coffee
not
an
afficionado
probably
the
roasted
malts
you
arent
going
to
want
to
drink
it
all
night
order
one
for
shits
and
giggles
and
then
let
it
go
youve
tried
it
and
you
can
tell
all
of
your
friends
sort
of
like
that
banana
bread
beer
most
accurate
label
ive
seen
just
smelling
gives
you
a
good
idea
how
strong
the
chocolate
flavor
is
and
actually
drinking
is
a
bit
overwhelming
the
first
time
around
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
delicious
dark
brown
and
opaque
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
beige
head
of
frothy
foam
that
settles
quickly
rich
aroma
of
cocoa
and
dark
malt
flavors
of
sweet
cocoa
upfront
morphs
to
coffee
and
marshmallow
notes
of
cola
dry
and
tannic
slightly
puckery
and
talcy
average
beer
if
you
like
hershey
syrup
this
is
your
beer
all
other
notes
are
average
at
best
if
you
like
chocolate
stouts
like
i
do
youll
love
this
one
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
fav
atwater
beer
the
flavor
has
a
good
cocoa
flavor
with
mildly
sweet
taste
and
light
toasted
malt
flavor
with
very
light
sweetness
and
yeast
in
taste
the
cocoa
carries
a
light
woody
accent
w
mostly
dry
flavor
in
the
finish
overall
a
pretty
decent
chocolate
flavor
not
as
stout
as
it
could
be
but
it
is
certainly
above
average
w
enough
cocoa
to
redeem
the
lack
of
malt
somewhat
black
pour
with
a
small
tan
head
big
chocolatey
aroma
taste
follows
the
nice
with
chocolate
upfront
that
has
a
combination
of
dark
chocolate
milk
chocolate
and
light
bittersweet
flavors
also
has
additional
flavors
of
light
espresso
and
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
medium
bodied
but
drinks
very
easy
finishes
lightly
sweet
and
chocolatey
not
what
i
expected
tastes
like
diet
yahoo
tastes
really
flat
and
plain
this
brewery
usually
puts
out
really
solid
stuff
this
brew
is
extremely
dark
with
reddish
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
tan
and
fairly
this
a
brilliant
chocolate
and
malt
aroma
dominates
the
beer
reminiscent
of
a
chocolate
malted
mild
in
the
smell
it
is
an
engaging
and
enticing
aroma
the
taste
is
balanced
and
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
flavorful
it
has
a
mildly
toasted
and
breads
character
as
well
as
the
chocolate
somewhat
chalky
full
in
body
and
good
this
beer
is
over
the
top
the
only
way
i
could
express
the
pleasure
is
to
compare
it
to
a
night
on
the
beach
with
a
beautiful
woman
m
wife
a
fine
cigar
a
fine
beer
and
soft
music
off
in
the
distance
how
could
i
better
express
my
satisfaction
this
had
a
pleasant
colalike
feel
but
this
seemed
more
like
a
schwarzbeir
lager
it
didnt
seem
to
have
the
full
ale
flavor
it
had
a
bright
finish
maybe
ill
try
another
though
o
good
beer
very
little
chocolate
more
toasty
malt
well
balanced
its
colalike
finish
is
a
far
cry
from
the
promising
upstart
of
lavishness
silkiness
or
velvety
texture
that
the
nose
and
early
taste
promises
light
perhapse
thin
and
on
the
verge
of
watering
the
beers
structure
falls
flat
and
gives
its
taste
a
colalike
finish
and
thats
unfortunate
because
its
upstart
is
so
so
promising
pours
very
dark
deep
brown
with
scarce
foam
on
top
deep
dark
chocolate
nose
malty
and
sweet
taste
is
on
the
lighter
side
chocolate
falls
a
little
flat
though
and
off
the
mark
not
enough
bitter
just
ok
final
grade

a
b
atwater
brewerys
decadent
dark
chocolate
ale
delivers
as
advertised
anyone
looking
for
an
affordable
sessionable
chocolate
stout
should
consider
giving
this
one
a
try
my
only
real
complaint
with
this
one
is
the
weak
mouthfeel
but
other
than
that
its
getting
the
job
done
tasty
stuff
ill
have
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
more
atwater
products
in
the
future
big
thanks
to
adam
for
gifting
me
this
and
other
michigan
beers
the
beer
is
near
black
the
lighting
was
low
with
a
small
tan
head
this
beer
is
all
about
the
chocolate
the
scent
and
the
flavor
are
rich
dark
chocolates
a
hint
of
espresso
bean
cocoa
medium
bodied
with
a
light
sweetness
perhaps
i
was
in
a
chocolate
mood
this
was
delicious
was
a
big
fan
of
the
bottled
on
date
at
the
bottom
of
the
sticker
got
a
fairly
old
batch
bottled
jan
2014
but
it
was
still
good
beer
dark
brown
color
no
head
has
an
amazing
dark
chocolate
smell
but
the
taste
is
underwhelming
despite
the
promise
of
the
aroma
i
got
very
little
in
terms
of
flavor
has
a
watery
feel
the
taste
is
strongly
reminiscent
of
a
weak
dr
pepper
palate
is
strongly
carbonated
and
comes
off
a
little
too
harsh
dark
rich
color
with
red
undertones
but
when
you
drink
it
it
doesnt
feel
heavy
or
thick
i
like
the
subtle
bubble
almost
like
soda
but
not
too
much
carbonation
so
its
still
smooth
and
not
airy
the
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
is
stronger
than
the
flavor
unfortunately
and
the
after
taste
is
a
bit
bitter
which
takes
away
from
upcoming
sips
so
the
first
swallow
is
the
best
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
as
a
snack
or
dessert
rather
than
with
a
meal
because
it
is
so
delicious
on
its
own
merit
its
bright
enough
that
you
can
drink
several
and
not
get
tired
or
overwhelmed
by
its
sweetness
atwater
brewery
can
claim
a
degree
of
pride
despite
the
low
reputation
of
detroit
my
only
other
suggestion
is
a
slightly
higher
alcoholic
content
if
youre
looking
to
enjoy
such
a
wealth
of
flavor
and
texture
you
might
as
well
get
a
buzz
while
youre
at
it
i
could
like
this
beer
but
at
every
step
im
left
wanting
more
more
flavor
more
richness
more
body
its
not
bad
its
just
not
enough
dark
chocolate
ale
pours
a
black
color
with
a
very
small
head
there
is
a
strong
dark
semisweet
chocolate
flavor
the
taste
has
a
semisweet
dark
chocolate
flavoring
very
nice
bold
chocolate
flavors
and
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
body
overall
wow
a
very
strong
darkchocolate
bomb
very
interesting
pick
j
overall
interesting
and
somewhat
complex
not
overdone
with
chocolate
so
you
could
have
a
few
just
as
if
you
were
drinking
a
straightforward
stout
worth
trying
o
overall
the
nose
is
the
best
aspect
here
fresh
strong
and
powdery
the
flavor
falls
off
a
bit
decent
but
a
bit
disappointing
when
compared
to
the
nose
and
the
mouthful
is
okay
but
could
of
been
more
lush
and
full
drinks
more
like
a
milk
stout
imho
with
a
nice
chocolate
aspect
o
solid
brew
kind
of
like
the
bud
light
of
american
chocolate
stouts
liked
it
that
was
about
it
for
the
positives
somehow
all
the
wonderful
chocolatey
elements
were
strictly
limited
to
the
smell
and
none
are
evident
in
the
taste
theres
a
slight
malt
character
with
a
the
barest
hint
of
the
chocolate
that
was
so
decadent
in
the
smell
and
after
that
nothing
it
literally
tastes
like
a
watered
down
version
of
itself
or
what
i
expected
based
on
the
intoxicating
smell
just
bland
slightly
sour
not
decadent
in
the
slightest
the
mouth
feel
is
similarly
poor
just
thin
and
weakly
carbonated
with
no
body
it
really
feels
like
drinking
a
killians
or
bud
that
had
slight
chocolate
flavor
added
as
it
warms
instead
of
the
flavor
opening
up
it
just
gets
bland
and
kind
of
gross
id
drink
this
over
something
like
pbr
but
whats
the
point
if
not
for
the
delicious
aroma
this
beer
would
be
a
total
waste
of
money
when
you
consider
that
a
four
pack
of
this
costs
the
same
as
founders
breakfast
stout
or
some
of
the
excellent
new
holland
high
gravity
series
here
in
michigan
at
least
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
to
buy
this
o
a
decent
beer
for
sure
worth
trying
especially
for
the
nose
but
wont
be
added
to
the
regular
lineup
price
point
2
2512oz
single
dark
cola
hue
nearly
black
with
ruby
highlights
thin
tan
head
texture
seems
a
bit
flimsy
for
a
big
chocolate
stout
aroma
is
sick
with
chocolate
syrup
perfume
laden
caramelized
sugars
with
a
hint
of
roasted
coffee
it
could
induce
diabetes
just
by
smelling
it
but
seriously
the
perceived
sweetness
on
the
nose
if
off
the
charts
think
hershey
syrup
flavor
how
does
that
sweetness
the
nose
derives
to
the
senses
play
out
on
the
palate
actually
somewhat
balanced
think
dry
cocoa
powder
in
a
very
much
bitter
dark
roasted
base
stout
enough
creamy
bitterness
with
a
bit
of
lactose
and
coffee
roasts
pleasantly
blends
the
flavor
into
something
much
more
enjoyable
than
the
initial
aromatics
expansive
creamy
dark
chocolate
fades
away
to
let
the
lactose
milk
sugars
take
stride
leaving
a
bit
of
an
interesting
creamy
texture
to
the
medium
to
full
bodied
stout
carbonation
level
is
natural
and
smooth
on
the
palate
finishes
pretty
clean
with
minimal
acrid
notes
of
acidity
from
the
dark
notes
overall
a
complex
stout
that
i
was
thinking
was
going
to
be
a
train
wreck
ended
up
being
pretty
much
a
win
in
my
book
only
2
50
for
a
single
definitely
worth
the
experience
but
in
truth
im
glad
i
didnt
invest
any
more
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
type
of
beer
that
i
would
drink
in
number
decent
little
beer
good
flavor
worthy
this
ale
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
with
very
little
head
or
lacing
smell
is
chocolate
first
and
foremost
a
hint
of
bread
and
not
much
else
heavily
harshly
carbonated
taste
begins
as
chocolate
soda
the
only
clue
i
have
that
this
is
beer
is
at
the
finish
which
is
thin
and
watery
with
some
nondescript
beer
flavor
the
chocolate
flavor
reminds
me
of
chocolate
necco
wafers
ive
had
chocolate
stouts
that
were
much
better
this
tastes
more
like
soda
than
beer
to
me
wont
be
drinking
this
again
tastes
very
similar
if
not
exactly
like
the
vanilla
java
porter
that
atwater
also
makes
this
flavor
was
great
excellent
you
can
sense
a
medium
coffee
taste
hinted
with
a
vanilla
creamer
i
would
rank
this
in
my
top
5
because
its
such
a
great
combination
of
everything
intertwined
together
i
could
drink
this
pretty
steady
est
168
calories
per
bottle
at
5
5
abv
overall
delivers
on
the
promised
chocolate
but
sweet
balance
thin
body
and
a
lack
of
complexity
limit
its
appeal
still
woth
trying
overall
this
is
not
as
good
as
it
should
be
but
the
misclassifying
does
not
help
i
guess
you
do
have
to
call
it
something
and
i
dont
know
what
it
should
be
called
american
dark
ale
with
flavoring
maybe
the
only
thing
that
keeps
this
from
being
an
outstanding
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
at
the
same
time
ive
come
to
like
it
for
the
same
reason
like
others
have
said
its
a
little
watery
but
comes
off
as
refreshing
to
me
and
goes
down
great
on
a
hot
day
i
think
i
may
have
stumbled
on
a
sessionable
stout
it
may
not
satisfy
the
need
for
a
nice
hefty
dessert
beer
but
might
cure
the
urge
for
stout
on
a
summer
day
without
the
big
beer
commitment
definitely
chocolatey
a
dessert
of
a
beer
would
be
more
pleasant
without
that
mid
palate
character
and
the
cola
notes
too
charred
for
my
liking
mild
head
maybe
half
a
finger
of
deep
tan
which
is
gone
licketysplit
not
much
stick
in
the
lacing
which
is
more
of
a
thin
slippery
sheet
than
anything
else
while
the
liquid
is
pure
black
it
doesnt
seem
impenetrably
dense
for
effects
sake
thin
aura
of
yellow
around
the
rims
there
you
can
see
a
blip
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
extremely
creamy
maple
syrup
molten
milk
chocolate
caramel
coffee
ice
cream
malted
milk
balls
light
cherry
fruit
not
overtly
sugary
nor
is
it
lacking
posture
simply
a
one
trick
pony
its
light
to
mediumbodied
in
the
mouth
and
drier
than
expected
based
on
the
nose
tighter
punch
to
the
carbonation
too
the
chocolate
cocoa
coffee
malt
flavors
are
all
there
however
they
lack
resonance
and
depth
more
grains
and
oats
and
a
dried
to
blanched
nuttiness
as
well
here
theres
some
herbal
hoppy
kick
any
fruit
gets
cloaked
by
the
roast
minor
cherry
plum
at
best
tacky
character
dries
onto
your
tongue
plenty
of
retronasal
cocoa
powder
unfortunately
it
is
sort
of
lifeless
and
turns
watery
at
the
end
ehh
what
can
you
do
o
a
bit
thin
for
a
heavy
chocolate
stout
but
its
not
bad
would
i
buy
again
probably
not
but
its
definitely
not
bad
for
dark
chocolate
lovers
this
is
the
beer
you
want
have
tried
many
chocolate
beers
in
the
past
and
atwater
hit
it
head
on
actually
walked
into
this
one
blindly
having
only
tried
a
few
other
beers
by
atwater
starting
to
become
a
huge
fan
of
this
brand
overall
tasty
sort
of
a
gimmicky
beer
that
i
probably
wont
buy
a
six
pack
of
that
being
said
it
was
an
interesting
experience
that
got
old
a
bit
fast
the
nose
is
definitely
its
strongest
attribute
but
the
thin
mouthfeel
and
relative
lack
of
complexity
are
definitely
its
weaknesses
that
being
said
its
not
a
terrible
beer
so
if
youre
thinking
about
trying
one
in
a
mixasix
i
definitely
encourage
you
to
try
it
very
enjoyable
and
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
beer
from
atwater
which
is
a
brewery
that
tends
to
underwhelm
me
if
the
feel
on
this
one
were
to
be
a
little
bit
creamier
and
the
aftertaste
was
more
like
the
taste
is
on
the
front
this
could
be
my
favorite
chocolateforward
stout
regardless
a
shockingly
tasty
beer
and
the
price
is
right
overall
the
strongest
aspect
of
this
beer
was
its
aroma
this
showed
big
chocolates
brown
malts
sugars
vanillas
and
general
sweetness
certainly
deserving
of
the
title
of
decadence
where
we
lost
points
was
through
the
end
of
the
sip
where
the
flavoring
was
almost
entirely
washed
out
with
watery
grain
affecting
not
only
the
taste
but
also
the
feel
atwater
has
continued
to
disappoint
us
in
cohesion
and
final
execution
of
their
styles
so
i
guess
well
have
to
wait
for
the
next
one
in
hopes
of
finding
something
that
is
worth
coming
back
to
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
chocolate
milkshake
sweet
some
hints
of
vanilla
taste
is
very
chocolatey
roasted
malts
some
vanilla
sweet
and
tasty
lots
of
flavor
here
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
worth
seeking
out
o
i
like
this
beer
it
is
not
the
best
chocolate
ale
the
label
does
not
say
stout
but
says
ale
but
i
think
it
is
good
not
exactly
what
i
normally
want
in
a
chocolate
brew
but
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
could
use
as
a
session
beer
i
will
get
again
overall
not
bad
but
from
the
nose
i
was
expecting
much
more
in
the
taste
and
the
feel
which
it
fell
somewhat
short
of
worth
a
try
but
not
the
best
out
there
overall
promise
unfulfilled
after
a
very
nice
start
the
chocolate
was
not
sustained
and
ultimately
the
beer
was
a
disappointment
malt
beverage
just
sounds
wrong
somehow
like
old
english
800
or
zima
overall
this
was
much
better
that
i
expected
that
it
would
be
with
really
enjoyable
chocolate
flavors
and
notes
which
mix
well
with
the
roasted
malts
coffee
and
vanilla
notes
an
easy
drinking
beer
o
a
pretty
good
beer
which
i
do
recommend
at
least
trying
if
nothing
else
the
chocolate
presence
is
nice
if
youre
like
me
and
absolutely
love
chocolate
and
beer
and
the
two
together
just
be
prepared
to
be
a
little
disappointed
because
this
beer
had
the
potential
to
be
great
excellent
brew
i
recommend
grabbing
it
but
to
be
enjoyed
in
limited
quantities
as
they
flavor
might
wear
on
you
after
one
or
two
on
a
side
note
i
would
like
to
note
that
this
could
match
up
amazingly
with
a
nice
cigar
the
decadent
dark
chocolate
ale
is
a
very
interesting
beer
the
beer
poured
an
opaque
black
with
thin
offwhite
head
that
is
leaving
some
lacing
the
smell
is
unbelievable
sweet
dark
chocolate
is
pronounced
the
taste
has
some
chocolate
but
would
definitely
want
more
cocoa
powder
is
present
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lacking
would
really
like
a
more
creamy
body
overall
thou
it
was
amazing
thanks
to
my
bro
in
law
the
nose
on
this
one
is
a
very
good
advertiser
unfortunately
the
rest
of
the
beer
doesnt
live
up
to
things
kind
of
chalky
with
cocoa
or
something
doesnt
mesh
well
with
the
beer
at
all
meh
this
is
looking
quite
like
a
waste
of
money
and
something
i
dont
want
to
finish
i
got
a
cap
of
a
finger
of
dense
deeptan
head
with
good
retention
from
my
pour
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
allowing
zero
light
penetration
nose
smelled
like
a
liquid
chocolate
bar
i
have
to
admit
that
i
have
been
underwhelmed
by
some
previous
atwater
offerings
but
this
was
showing
real
promise
mouthfeel
was
thin
especially
for
a
stout
but
the
taste
was
very
chocolaty
although
not
what
i
would
have
expected
from
dark
chocolate
were
they
referring
to
the
color
hmmm
it
was
quite
sweet
but
still
very
chocolaty
finish
remained
very
sweet
and
this
would
be
a
dessert
beer
for
me
not
bad
but
not
great
either
o
im
let
down
here
the
smell
started
off
pretty
strong
but
it
was
all
downhill
from
there
there
are
better
options
out
there
even
if
this
6er
was
right
around
10
good
stuff
here
nice
to
have
a
stout
that
is
flavored
with
chocolate
that
is
sessionable
good
stuff
here
highly
drinkable
and
tasty
a
really
nice
wintertime
change
of
pace
brew
for
me
o
a
decent
beer
i
would
recommend
trying
it
once
or
twice
after
a
meal
definitely
a
fall
to
winter
beer
i
havent
had
many
atwater
brews
and
this
one
doesnt
turn
my
opinion
either
way
o
i
had
high
hopes
so
i
am
a
little
disappointed
but
it
was
an
interesting
beer
to
try
this
isnt
a
very
drinkable
beer
by
itself
but
i
feel
like
it
would
be
a
treat
if
it
is
paired
well
with
something
else
for
some
reason
ham
with
pineapple
comes
to
mind
as
a
good
complement
to
this
beers
flavors
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
nice
extremely
dark
opaque
brown
poured
a
practically
nonexistent
head
aroma
was
a
very
rich
milk
chocolate
slightly
over
sweet
taste
was
a
sweet
chocolate
up
front
before
shifting
to
a
slightly
smokey
flavor
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
a
bit
of
chew
slightly
thick
coated
well
but
no
carbonation
at
all
overall
not
bad
but
a
few
notches
short
of
what
it
could
be
this
is
terrible
i
like
maple
syrup
but
a
i
was
expecting
chocolate
and
b
thats
a
nasty
back
end
thats
yucky
two
ways
d
nice
brew
from
atwater
defintely
worth
a
try
and
very
appropriate
for
late
autumn
early
winter
worth
a
pickup
for
a
holiday
meal
ender
o
good
beer
very
desert
esk
but
easy
to
drink
i
would
recommended
giving
it
a
try
the
chocolate
isnt
overwhelming
like
some
other
chocolate
ales
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
and
an
average
example
of
a
chocolate
stout
it
was
going
in
the
right
direction
when
it
came
to
the
aroma
but
when
it
came
to
the
taste
is
felt
like
a
watered
down
version
of
the
aroma
and
that
was
a
bit
of
let
down
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
but
the
flavors
would
wear
on
me
quickly
so
i
think
one
would
be
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
nice
and
dominated
by
chocolate
syrup
the
appearance
was
also
wasnt
that
bad
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
is
how
watery
it
tasted
and
felt
this
beer
would
be
much
better
if
the
body
was
much
thicker
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
often
i
would
much
rather
have
their
vanilla
java
porter
but
it
is
worth
trying
once
to
see
where
you
stand
with
it
all
in
all
i
thought
this
beer
had
a
flavor
thats
pretty
similar
to
vanilla
java
porter
but
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
chocolate
syrup
it
was
ok
but
its
nothing
i
feel
the
need
to
drink
again
anytime
soon
this
was
a
decent
attempt
by
atwater
but
when
it
came
to
flavor
and
mouthfeel
it
fell
short
better
luck
next
time
guys
overall
this
is
a
successfully
drinkable
chocolate
ale
o
not
bad
but
not
good
enough
to
break
into
the
rotation
overall
finally
a
beer
from
atwater
that
i
actually
enjoyed
its
no
southern
tier
chocolat
but
it
fills
the
need
for
chocolate
flavored
beer
very
nice
flavors
are
richer
than
those
of
southern
tiers
choklat
and
theres
a
better
balance
here
i
wonder
if
the
abv
affects
such
flavors
overall
delicious
at
first
i
thought
it
more
of
a
dessert
beerthe
kind
where
you
have
just
one
by
the
time
i
the
first
though
i
found
myself
wanting
another
and
even
a
third
after
that
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
this
beer
out
in
the
future
overall
the
dark
chocolate
seems
a
bit
forced
ive
had
several
other
stouts
with
a
more
natural
and
better
quality
cocoa
flavor
the
aroma
had
my
hopes
sky
high
but
the
taste
didnt
quite
come
though
i
really
like
this
beer
probably
the
best
chocolate
beer
ive
had
i
would
gladly
buy
it
again
and
would
recommend
it
i
cant
say
ive
ever
had
a
chocoalte
beer
as
well
balanced
as
this
one
kudos
12

pours
slightly
hazy
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
1
finger
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
slight
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
big
chocolate
caramel
toffee
roasted
malt
vanilla
cream
and
a
touch
of
herbal

nice
and
well
balanced

with
good
strength
taste
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
vanilla
caramel
toffee
biscuit
and
herbal
hops
good
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
roasted
malt
caramel
toffee
vanilla
chocolate
and
herbal
spiciness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
not
as
much
chocolate
in
the
taste
as
i
was
hoping
but
there
is
a
good
flavor
balance
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
present
overall
this
is
a
nice
pleasant
and
enjoyable
brew
from
atwater
very
smooth
and
drinkable
as
well
overall
one
of
the
best
chocolate
ales
i
have
had
this
brewery
has
exceptional
chocolate
stouts
i
am
glad
they
transferred
that
knowledge
to
an
ale
overall
not
too
bad
good
to
try
what
a
treat
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
huge
sweet
beer
like
the
southern
tier
blackwater
series
but
this
is
quite
the
opposite
all
the
flavors
of
chocolate
cream
and
vanilla
are
present
without
the
diabetic
shock
coming
with
it
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
out
worth
seeking
out
to
try
smell
is
the
highlight
with
overwhelming
coffee
aroma
really
thin
for
a
stout
overall
not
bad
not
great
o
fantastic
coffee
beer
i
only
drink
my
coffee
dark
roasted
and
black
this
hits
all
the
right
notes
no
sweetness
just
great
notes
of
bitter
coffee
and
chocolates
just
great
though
i
can
see
how
some
might
be
put
off
if
they
are
expecting
something
sweeter
overall
a
very
good
coffee
beer
lighter
and
less
boozy
than
most
coffee
stouts
but
thats
not
always
a
bad
thing
plenty
of
flavor
here
subdued
inital
malt
with
a
stronger
coffee
taste
bitter
but
not
egregiously
so
aftertaste
overall
mild
for
a
stout
no
alcohol
taste
whatsoever
man
i
really
liked
this
fantastic
coffee
roasted
malt
and
slight
chocolate
flavor
until
about
3
seconds
after
i
swallowed
terrible
i
mean
terrible
aftertaste
ruined
everything
great
it
initially
one
of
the
worst
stout
aftertastes
i
have
experienced
almost
a
rotten
moldy
flavor
sad
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
and
stock
up
on
a
good
cheap
coffee
stout
overall
i
like
the
sweet
chocolate
and
roast
coffee

overall
very

othis
definitely
gets
the
job
done
it
lacks
any
real
charisma
unfortunately
its
a
tasty
stout
that
delivers
plenty
of
java
flavor
and
not
much
more
a
great
stout
one
of
those
enormous
dark
beers
that
just
satisfies
like
no
other
on
an
unseasonably
cold
monday
afternoon
dark
in
color
almost
black
in
fact
but
showing
some
dark
chocolate
tones
around
the
edges
under
a
rather
lazy
inch
of
tan
foam
the
nose
is
coffee
first
mixed
in
with
some
chocolate
malt
dark
chocolate
cake
or
fudge
brownie
and
a
bold
ale
yeast
love
the
combination
here
the
taste
is
similar
with
plenty
of
robust
coffee
flavor
but
very
little
acidity
or
mouthfeel
weirdness
from
it
belgian
dark
chocolate
flavor
in
the
finish
some
mild
birch
or
maple
syrups
sweetness
and
a
dark
roasted
barley
that
is
large
without
being
especially
bitter
i
think
the
mix
of
flavors
and
textures
is
wonderful
velvety
smooth
but
shockingly
full
flavored
full
bodied
yet
real
easy
drinking
a
nice
mix
i
think
oakshire
has
impressed
during
its
brief
stead
in
colorado
and
i
hope
they
continue
to
show
up
periodically
with
new
stuff
as
i
think
everything
they
do
has
been
excellent
great
use
of
coffee
in
a
drinkable
stout
perfect
cold

brew
12oz

paid

59
dark
black
tan
head
looks
decent
doesnt
smell
like
much
other
than
some
burnt
coffee
and
grounds
flavor
is
more
burnt
coffee
not
very
much
stout
not
very
appetizing
i
wouldnt
say
this
tasted
bad
but
i
wouldnt
reach
for
another
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
beer
though
plenty
of
coffee
both
stale
and
fresh
a
bit
thin
does
as
advertised
but
nothing
more
o
tasty
stout
with
light
coffee
flavor
the
taste
is
a
nice
dose
of
coffee
but
there
does
not
seem
to
be
much
in
the
way
of
caffeine
it
is
also
rather
milky
and
slightly
bitter
at
the
end
this
is
a
stout
worth
having
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
much
like
the
other
oakshire
beers
they
have
done
a
great
job
with
this
one
as
well
pours
blackwith
a
bubbly
mocha
head
aroma
is
not
nearly
as
aggressive
as
i
hoped
its
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
i
was
hoping
this
would
be
bolder
and
not
quite
as
balanced
as
it
turns
out
to
be
roasted
espresso
dark
chocolate
and
some
sweetness
from
the
sugars
that
come
from
the
oats
a
touch
more
of
that
espresso
shows
itself
in
the
flavor
roasted
barley
chocolate
and
some
sugars
from
the
oats
a
touch
of
some
char
flirts
with
things
throughout
providing
a
kiss
of
some
bitterness
a
creamy
kinda
thinner
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
nice
beer
at
5
49
a
bomber
well
worth
my
money
something
i
would
definitely
buy
again
overall
not
bad
clean
beer
and
a
nice
coffee
flavor
but
not
a
lot
else
going
on
o
very
good
i
like
how
it
is
surprisingly
refreshing
for
an
oatmeal
coffee
stout
finishes
mostly
clean
o
one
has
to
love
how
drinkable
this
is
the
lack
of
creamy
softness
is
easy
to
overlook
for
this
reason
i
wouldnt
trade
for
it
but
i
would
buy
it
again
if
i
ever
caught
it
in
a
store
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
i
have
tried
this
in
the
past
and
i
hate
coffee
but
my
palette
has
changed
it
pours
our
black
and
thin
but
very
dark
the
foam
was
a
dark
brown
color
and
it
disappeared
almost
instantly
held
up
to
light
nothing
gets
through
the
smell
perhaps
this
is
too
cold
is
coffee
that
is
it
not
much
else
going
on
here
not
that
strong
i
wonder
how
old
this
bottle
is
the
flavor
is
delicious
the
coffee
is
more
subtle
this
has
to
have
aged
for
just
a
bit
but
long
enough
for
some
of
the
flavors
to
taper
down
basically
you
get
the
coffee
burnt
ashy
malts
smokiness
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
for
the
mouthfeel
i
was
a
bit
let
down
this
is
thin
for
an
oatmeal
stout
it
is
a
low
alcoholic
stout
so
i
would
imagine
it
to
be
a
bit
thin
on
the
medium
side
of
beer
mouthfeel
but
with
that
low
carbonation
the
flavors
linger
and
and
i
like
that
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
wonder
what
its
like
fresh
this
bottle
has
to
be
a
bit
older
but
i
like
it
and
since
i
live
near
oregon
i
can
get
this
really
cheap
its
worth
the
price
ill
get
it
again
if
i
want
a
dark
low
end
beer
o
this
is
a
delicious
creamy
espressoforward
beer
the
palate
opens
with
a
nice
espresso
flavor
fresh
clean
mildly
fruity
and
moderately
roasty
it
is
expressed
in
a
way
i
like
the
base
stout
however
isnt
up
to
the
challenge
mildly
roasty
not
chocolatey
enough
and
rather
thin
the
base
stout
really
is
disappointing
drying
roasty
faintly
watery
and
with
a
nice
lingering
coffee
flavor
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
carbonated
a
little
too
highly
for
my
liking
the
carbonic
acid
clashes
with
the
excellently
expressed
coffee
acidity
the
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
finish
is
a
nice
touch
decent
stuff
it
could
use
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
body
to
go
with
the
rather
excellent
coffee
flavor
served
from
a
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
this
beer
is
really
dark
a
dark
brown
to
almost
black
it
has
a
nice
tanish
brown
head
which
leaves
a
nice
lacing
aroma
is
dominated
by
coffee
and
chocolate
hints
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
light
carbonation
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavor
with
sweet
malts
and
dark
coffee
overall
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
is
pretty
drinkable
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on

of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
dirtearth
and
some
super
roasty
espresso
and
coffee
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
along
with
a
cocoa
flavor
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
but
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
smells
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
has
deecent
retention
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
lots
of
coffee
a
light
nutty
note
and
a

come
in
as
well
as
a

of
hops
to
round
things
out
taste
lacks

sweetness
and
stays
on
the
dry

side
of
things
very
dry
on

not
a

to

mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonation
with
somewhat
light

lots
of
espresso
here
as
well
as
roasted

but
there
is
not
enough
sweetness
to
balance
out
these
flavors
the
results
is
somewhat
ashy
and
overly
dry
o
what
an
amazing
coffee
forward

coffee
without
the
astringent
over
roasted

overall
this
is

a

with
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
i
really
have
no
complaints
really
well
done
o
nice
stout
with
good
amount
of
coffee
and
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
balance
this
beer
out
nicely
o
good
coffee
stout
good
oatmeal
stout
good
stout
i
have
had
better
but
i
would
certainly
buy
this
again
overall
plenty
of
coffee
drinks
pretty
easy
great
with
brunch
overall
this
one
went
down
easy
loving
what
oakshire
is
doing
and
very
happy
that
boise
has
access
please
keep
us
in
your
loop
o
coffee
dominates
with
roast
chocolate
and
hints
of
dark
fruitiness
behind
very
little
hop
character
and
while
i
liked
this
beer
as
a
showcase
for
espresso
there
are
also
better
coffee
beers
out
there
imo
still
an
easy
drinker
and
recommended
a
decent
option
at
a
decent
price
it
was
good
enough
to
make
me
pick
up
another
bottle
next
time
im
in
waor
and
next
time
ill
drink
it
fresh
and
see
what
happens
o
pretty
good
cappucinno
stout
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
and
quite
drinkable
coffee
beer
id
definitely
have
this
guy
again
a
nice
coffee
stout
but
ill
admit
ive
been
spoiled
lately
by
copious
amounts
of
wakenbake
and
founders
breakfast
stout
this
one
is
a
bit
different
than
those
however
using
a
sweet
stout
as
a
base
making
this
a
bit
unique
as
those
sweet
stout
characteristics
definitely
come
through
thanks
chumba526
for
the
opportunity
t
roasted
malt
and
day
old
coffee
upfront
some
hints
of
dark
chocolate
licorice
and
a
hint
of
smoke
and
charred
malt
on
the
finish
im
digging
the
flavors
but
not
the
mouthfeel
its
way
too
thin
for
my
taste
thin
watery
lingers
when
i
dont
want
so
disgusting
nasty
flavors
and
body
i
like
it
a
lot
i
like
coffee
a
lot
so
its
a
natural
that
i
would
like
this
o
a
good
espresso
stout
not
fantastic
but
good
i
would
enjoy
another
one
if
i
came
across
it
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
it
out
the
mouthfeel
was
this
beers
biggest
letdown
for
me
drinkable
but
lacks
sweetness
and
body
really
well
balanced
good
flavour
that
comes
out
and
it
is
balanced
enough
that
you
could
drink
several
overall
this
beer
is
definitely
a
favorite
of
mine
and
a
big
favorite
of
the
locals
for
a
reason
o
pretty
good
and
for
a
single
stout
it
boasts
a
lot
of
flavor
overall
pretty
good
for
a
coffee
stout
but
i
tend
to
lean
more
towards
the
bigger
bolder
imperial
coffee
stouts
such
as
yeti
speedway
etc
i
wont
hold
that
against
this
beer
as
they
are
not
the
same
style
i
probably
wouldnt
search
this
out
again
as
i
enjoyed
the
imperial
version
more
still
good
for
the
style
nothing
too
fancy
but
a
a
solid
well
made
coffee
stout
overall
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
warm
opaque
sable
just
a
hair
above
black
with
a
very
finebubbled
and
persistent
tan
head
roast
coffee
aroma
has
a
hint
of
semisweet
chocolate
flavor
is
like
a
topoftheline
mocha
quality
coffee
and
chocolate
with
nutty
smoky
and
molasses
hints
texture
is
velvety
smooth
and
nicely
fizzy
as
this
beer
progressed
the
carbonation
almost
disappeared
that
became
much
less
of
a
problem
the
flavor
improved
and
the
mouthfeel
got
smoother
but
neither
of
them
were
all
that
much
better
than
what
they
started
out
at
tried
it
at
oakshire
brewing
poured
from
tap
into
a
pint
glass
according
to
the
brewmaster
there
is
one
shot
of
espresso
per
pint
aroma
was
full
of
coffee
and
malty
subtleties
the
pour
and
appearance
was
dark
and
lent
to
the
richness
to
come
this
brew
is
creamy
sweet
and
has
a
wonderful
hop
middle
that
is
not
to
be
messed
with
this
brew
is
a
perfect
marriage
of
coffee
and
beer
aka
oregon
greatness
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
is
very
strong
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
ton
of
coffee
and
chocolate
as
well
as
some
strong
roasted
malt
notes
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
coffee
stout
this
beer
is
incredible
it
pours
out
a
deep
black
color
with
brown
edges
and
a
gnarly
brown
thick
head
the
aroma
is
heavily
of
chocolate
and
darkly
roasted
thick
coffee
awesome
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
this
beer
has
so
much
flavor
for
only
being
5
8abv
it
has
a
medium
body
and
very
rich
flavors
i
have
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
from
this
brewery
every
beer
they
make
is
awesome
and
this
is
no
exception
well
done
all
in
all
one
of
my
favorite
coffee
stouts
out
there
not
quite
the
top
but
definitely
up
there
and
worth
seeking
out
if
coffee
brews
are
up
your
alley
o
pretty
good
coffee
beer
not
overwhelming
or
knock
your
socks
off
good
but
solid
maybe
my
bottle
was
skunked
maybe
the
added
coffee
thinned
it
too
much
i
just
found
too
much
barley
malts
and
not
enough
balance
live
and
learn
if
you
are
in
the
market
for
an
espressocoffee
stout
i
strongly
suggest
this
beer
the
smell
doesnt
give
off
a
strong
coffeeespresso
aroma
if
anything
i
get
a
little
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
great
good
espresso
taste
which
goes
down
very
smooth
i
am
getting
a
nice
creamy
head
and
average
lacing
review
based
on
notes
from
tasting
on
feb
1
2011
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
perhaps
a
little
thin
for
an
oatmeal
stout
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
good
i
really
enjoyed
the
espresso
flavors
the
flavors
were
kind
of
one
dimensional
in
that
the
espresso
overpowered
everything
but
that
seems
like
the
intent
thankfully
the
espresso
was
very
nice
and
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
evening
i
could
drink
one
of
these
but
not
many
more
the
standout
coffee
flavor
may
appeal
to
coffee
freaks
but
other
than
that
it
is
not
much
of
a
session
as
others
have
said
drink
this
for
breakfast
or
on
a
hot
summer
dayassuming
you
really
enjoy
22
ounces
of
cold
black
coffee
i
seriously
think
you
could
add
cream
and
sugar
to
this
stuff
with
this
beer
its
coffee
to
the
max
no
balance
whatsoever
on
the
dry
spectrum
of
coffee
stouts
which
really
lets
the
espresso
come
through
a
good
drink
for
a
coffee
beer
drinkability
great
if
you
love
coffee
the
bitterness
from
the
espresso
as
opposed
to
hops
is
a
fun
and
different
spin
the
stoutness
of
the
beer
makes
it
a
sturdy
drink
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
pint
because
of
its
unique
taste
however
i
am
surely
enjoying
this
one
pint
d
very
quaffable
d
im
not
a
huge
coffee
drinker
so
im
not
inclined
to
revisit
this
one
that
being
said
though
i
can
see
what
is
trying
to
be
accomplished
here
and
for
those
fans
of
big
roasty
coffee
and
coffee
beers
this
is
a
must
try
bottle
poured
into
a
ccb
tulip
glass
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
quickly
forms
a
tan
collar
around
the
glass
aroma
is
that
of
leather
coffee
hazelnut
and
dark
chocolate
the
nuttiness
is
stronger
in
the
aroma
more
than
anything
nice
lace
left
on
the
glass
as
i
swirl
it
around
medium
mouthfeel
espresso
indeed
dark
bitter
roast
coffee
dominate
the
flavor
profile
in
this
one
some
leather
type
notes
as
well
bitterness
lingers
on
well
it
pretty
much
is
what
it
says
it
is
strong
coffee
style
stout
might
use
a
little
more
malt
to
balance
it
out
as
the
bitterness
from
the
roast
is
pretty
strong
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
ruby
brown
highlights
that
had
a
thin
bubbly
head
and
left
a
little
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
very
nice
espresso
coffee
aroma
dominate
the
nose
with
roasty
character
chocolate
malts
vanilla
and
slight
lacto
milky
notes
the
espresso
coffee
notes
also
dominate
the
taste
with
milky
lacto
vanilla
and
chocolate
accents
the
brew
was
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
slight
astringent
roasty
and
creamy
finish
it
drank
pretty
good
but
was
also
damn
rich
in
flavor
it
is
definitely
a
dessert
beer
that
would
go
great
with
chocolate
cake
or
sometime
like
that
d
lowish
on
the
abv
highish
on
flavor
a
nicely
drinkable
little
stout
i
have
to
thank
my
buddy
ck
for
this
tasty
offering
this
is
a
great
idea
if
youre
drinking
it
for
breakfast
any
other
time
of
day
i
think
this
bomber
may
be
a
bit
too
much
pours
a
mice
dark
brown
really
coming
close
to
being
black
and
nearly
opaque
small
mocha
head
nose
brings
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
along
with
some
really
strong
espresso
notes
great
coffee
character
the
taste
tones
the
coffee
down
a
bit
but
its
still
quite
pleasurable
good
feel
with
nice
carbonation
a
very
fine
coffee
beer
wow
i
was
blown
away
i
had
no
real
expectations
as
id
never
even
heard
of
the
brewery
but
this
is
an
incredible
coffee
stout
for
everyday
drinking
highly
recommended
sampled
this
at
savor
2010
poured
black
with
a
beige
head
modest
retention
and
good
lacing
huge
roasted
coffee
bean
nose
with
some
bittersweet
chocolate
and
cocoa
powder
hints
as
well
copious
amounts
of
flavor
in
the
taste
with
roasted
malt
and
coffee
dominating
and
then
mixing
with
some
chocolate
midpalate
and
finishing
on
a
pronounced
dry
coffee
note
smooth
and
on
the
thicker
side
with
very
little
carbonation
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
coffee
stout
dthis
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
when
my
favorite
obsidian
stout
is
available
in
six
packs
for
8
99
often
much
less
on
sale
there
really
is
no
place
in
my
fridge
for
this
beer
that
is
usually
about
5
a
bomber
this
is
the
second
oakshire
beer
that
i
have
had
the
chance
to
try
and
all
i
was
say
is
that
i
wish
this
brewery
were
closer
to
me
or
vice
versa
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
definately
one
that
i
would
continue
to
purchase
if
given
the
opportunity
dvery
big
flavor
and
low
on
alcohol
content
nice
tastes
and
straight
forward
espresso
easy
drinking
not
heavy
and
still
very
tasty
served
in
a
pint
glass
at
henrys
12th
st
basically
this
is
a
big
tasty
espresso
stout
where
the
beans
stand
up
and
are
support
by
a
background
of
cocoa
and
roasted
barley
no
coffee
lover
should
pass
this
beer
up
its
a
great
example
of
how
to
integrate
espresso
and
beer
in
one
heck
of
a
tasty
brew
drinkability
very
drinkable
balanced
flavor
dthis
brew
has
huge
flavor
for
a
nonimperial
stout
its
a
big
beer
all
around
its
nice
to
see
a
small
beer
packed
with
tons
of
big
beer
flavorbut
it
does
seem
kinda
one
dimensional
at
times
if
coffee
beers
are
your
thingthen
this
beer
is
definitely
for
youif
notstay
away
cheers
to
james
for
sending
me
another
great
brew
impression
i
may
be
moving
to
oregon
soon
somewhere
between
bend
and
eugene
drinkability
overall
very
good
this
was
the
most
straightforward
coffee
flavored
stouts
ive
had
tasty
enjoyable
and
reasonable
abv
makes
this
easy
to
enjoy
could
be
a
bit
more
balanced
in
flavor
but
the
point
is
espresso
stout
and
it
certainly
accomplishes
that
id
recommend
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
lot
a
good
coffee
stout
that
i
woulod
purchase
again
if
it
was
avaialble
in
ca
oakshire
espresso
stout
is
easy
drinking
craft
beer
that
should
please
a
lot
of
java
junkies
in
the
pacific
northwest
that
said
why
not
crank
up
the
barley
boost
the
abv
to
7
5
and
go
for
greatness
shows
an
excellent
dark
color
with
an
oatmeal
hue
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
decent
lace
the
aromas
are
prominent
with
mostly
coffee
and
espresso
like
notes
the
taste
is
all
nutty
coffee
and
smoke
good
but
not
very
complex
the
palate
is
medium
bodied
with
good
grip
finishes
pretty
balanced
and
smooth
overall
a
great
albeit
one
dimensional
stout
tastes
like
an
alcoholic
iced
espresso
d
i
enjoy
stouts
and
usually
find
coffee
stouts
to
be
a
bit
overpowering
after
a
while
but
this
one
is
much
more
drinkable
the
coffee
flavors
blend
in
well
with
malts
and
really
adds
to
the
beer
this
one
is
best
at
cellar
temp
the
nose
is
dominant
espresso
with
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
a
little
toffee
the
malt
has
a
strong
roasted
profile
with
an
earthy
quality
the
flavor
opens
with
strong
coffee
notes
and
roasted
malt
astringency
is
light
and
theres
a
moderate
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
silky
and
full
overall
impression
excellent
stout
probably
my
favorite
coffee
beer
ive
tried
so
far
this
is
a
very
good
espresso
stout
with
a
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
and
good
coffee
presence
in
the
nose
good
beer
for
coffee
lovers
who
dont
mind
the
big
burnt
malt
character
nothing
wrong
here
just
a
really
nicely
made
oatmeal
espresso
stout
assertive
yet
balanced
coffee
flavors
with
the
oatmeal
adding
a
smoothness
and
overall
good
drinkibility
to
this
thats
2
for
2
on
oakshires
bottled
offerings
im
looking
forward
to
more
of
their
stuff
in
the
future
gorgeous
looking
beer
darkdarkest
brown
with
a
lovelly
tight
bubbly
tan
head
very
coffee
accented
nose
coffee
and
burnt
oat
again
the
flavour
is
dominated
by
the
dark
french
roast
style
coffee
followed
by
some
dark
raisin
fruit
and
cream
weird
thinish
palate
actually
more
like
a
porter
palate
but
overall
a
good
beer
this
beer
looks
and
smells
amazing
but
is
not
very
well
balanced
with
way
too
intense
of
a
roasty
coffee
flavor
that
overpowers
the
silky
choclate
malt
notes
lying
underneath
overall
a
nice
stout
with
a
noticable
but
not
overpowering
coffee
presence
supposedly
a
full
shot
of
organic
espresso
is
brewed
into
each
pint
of
stout
making
this
an
odd
choice
as
one
of
just
four
ales
oakshire
offers
year
round
but
overcast
succeeds
admirably
anyone
looking
for
an
espresso
stout
should
look
here
very
dark
sweet
thick
coffeeish
and
chocolatey
for
some
reason
the
other
reviewers
didnt
seem
to
take
to
this
beer
but
we
think
its
a
fine
coffee
stout
well
worth
seeking
out
although
probably
only
available
in
oregon
we
had
it
at
the
atlantis
lounge
at
mississippi
pizzahighly
recommended
the
dublin
pub
and
a
coffeehouse
in
the
ecotrust
building
in
the
pearl
d
unknown
abv
but
seems
in
the
6
range
as
such
its
drinkable
enough
worth
having
again
d
flavors
in
some
regards
come
and
go
coffee
and
more
coffee
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
coffee
in
my
beers
but
this
one
lacks
overall
elements
to
make
it
the
least
bit
enjoyable
body
is
not
chunky
enough
for
me
and
results
in
a
slightly
average
experience
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
goes
down
very
easily
bartender
was
sure
of
abv
but
thought
around
6
which
seems
a
bit
high
to
me
based
on
how
it
drank
even
as
a
coffee
lover
though
i
didnt
need
more
then
one
of
these
a
bit
too
one
dimensional
and
not
that
exciting
on
tap
at
good
times
extremely
heavy
espresso
taste
and
a
dark
as
sin
black
pour
with
a
solid
head
very
refreshing
and
relaxing
it
makes
me
want
to
take
a
nap
but
in
a
good
way
at
this
point
this
brew
is
probably
what
i
have
most
often
on
tap
at
my
favorite
bar
hopefully
more
people
will
learn
about
this
one
soon
all
in
all
a
nice
little
beer
that
i
can
see
having
a
pint
of
on
ocasion
and
im
really
not
a
small
beer
fan
small
head
dissipates
very
quickly
not
as
deep
black
as
i
like
when
observing
the
stout
in
the
glass
smells
unbelievable
like
a
roastcoffeehouse
the
aroma
really
is
all
there
taste
is
upfront
stouty
but
really
unoffensive
if
youre
ia
stout
head
then
this
is
very
mild
brew
but
still
very
flavorful
and
enjoyable
very
smooth
and
grainy
i
really
enjoy
hopworks
and
this
stout
was
certainly
no
dissapointment
smooth

id
be
curious
to
taste
these
seven
grains
without
such
a
potent
dose
of
coffee
in
the
mix
the
latter
flavor
is
too
strong
masking
the
other
goodies
that
one
can
sense
are
lurking
beneath
this

me

i
honestly
cant
tell
if
there
are
7

3

in
this

its
delicious

that

can

a

are

is
incredibly

its
got
an
appealing

flavor
that
improves

glad
it
is
organic
this
is
right
in
my
wifes
wheelhouse
with
the
almostsessionable
abv
and
porterlike
flavor
flavorwise
its
a
solid
contendor
for
a
top
spot
but
the
thin
mouthfeel
detracts
from
the
overall
experience
for
me
but
not
my
wife
o
what
an
interesting
brew
lots
of
exotic
grains
that
balance
well
and
combine
into
a
surprisingly
decent
flavor
coffee
is
very
strong
in
the
aroma
but
it
is
toned
down
in
the
flavor
portion
quite
a
bit
such
that
it
melds
with
all
the
grains
instead
of
overpowers
them
dont
expect
a
normal
stout
with
this
one
its
basically
got
lots
of
toasted
borderline
roasty
grain
notes
with
coffee
mixed
in
like
a
maltheavy
brown
ale
with
coffee
in
a
manner
of
speaking
sort
of
a
hybrid
beer
still
very
tasty
complex
especially
for
5
3
balanced
and
smooth
i
enjoyed
it
o
the
organic
aspect
is
appreciated
i
wish
it
had
more
of
a
variety
in
the
flavor
profile
to
balance
out
the
earth
tones
really
reminds
me
of
a
cold
carbonated
cup
of
coffee
not
a
bad
thing
but
not
what
i
expected
would
go
great
with
a
granola
bar
o
i
had
higher
expectations
for
a
beer
that
looked
so
good
but
unfortunately
it
didnt
hold
up
the
flavor
is
good
with
nice
coffee
accent
and
mild
hop
bitterness
with
creamy
malt
which
is
toasted
with
some
dried
fruit
flavor
from
both
the
coffee
and
yeast
with
nice
tinge
of
herbal
hops
that
balances
the
grain
flavor
which
has
sweet
and
earthy
flavor
that
adds
to
the
cold
pressed
coffee
which
is
more
cocoalike
than
bitter
coffee
the
overall
impression
was
a
very
good
stout
i
like
the
unique
combination
of
ingredients
and
flavors
that
it
brings
with
some
nice
currant
and
coffee
in
the
taste
as
a
coffee
beer
it
fails
as
there
are
dozens
of
better
ones
in
the
market
as
a
exotic
grain
beer
it
fairs
much
better
as
the
flavor
is
unique
thanks
gkatsoris
for
the
opportunity
a
elegant
fresh
coffee
stout
with
well
hidden
alcohol
i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
and
though
not
something
i
would
get
all
time
i
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
it

i
want

to

this
is
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
the
more
i
drink
of
it
the
more
i
like
it
definitely
worth
checking
out
that
said
i
should
do
this
side

only
the
two
could
ever
be

found
it
to
be

bad

not

overall
a
nice

the
body
is
a

weird
and
light
and
it
feels
like
the
abv
should
be
higher
from
the
shine
it
leaves
in
my
mouth
perhaps
thats
the
grains
at
work
smells
pretty
great
and
tastes
solid
as
well
a
worthwhile
stout
to
check
out
for

a

overall
a
very
nice
enjoyable
stout
overall
just
and
ok
beer
not
sure
if
it
is
the
organic
ingredients
or
the
coffee
but
it
has
a
funky
flavor
profile
overall
very
good
coffee
beer
coffee
bender
has
a
challenger
wow
this
was
good
stout
with
those
lush
flavors
just
seeming
to
literally
jump
out
of
the
glass
here
on
draft
i
became
a
big
fan
of
stumptown
coffee
during
this
trip
so
i
wasnt
surprised
to
find
out
that
this
ended
up
being
finished
with
it
as
the
coffee
character
here
was
my
favorite
part
of
this
it
was
maybe
a
little
too
coffee
heavy
at
times
as
i
really
didnt
get
any
of
the
nuances
from
the
multitude
of
grains
used
in
this
but
whatever
stouts
this
rich
and
flavorful
are
always
appreciated
when
i
find
them
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
puffy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
mark
the
drink
down
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
of
brewed
coffee
coffee
grounds
and
grain
aromas
taste
is
very
heavy
on
the
coffee
flavor
almost
like
a
strong
coffee
that
some
coffee
grounds
got
into
there
are
also
some
grainy
flavors
but
i
have
never
had
amaranth
or
kamut
so
i
have
no
idea
if
these
are
present
bitter
coffee
ground
flavors
stick
around
after
each
sip
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
that
is
heavier
on
the
coffee
than
the
grains
still
a
solid
brew
that
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
the
appearance
was
a
little
interesting
the
beer
gave
me
pretty
good
lacing
not
amazing
though
the
body
looks
good
from
the
start
and
it
still
does
the
one
thing
that
kinda
sucks
is
the
foam
and
head
on
top
of
the
body
are
completely
gone
now
and
the
top
of
the
body
kinda
just
reminds
me
of
the
mouthfeel
watery
and
thing
its
not
a
huge
problem
because
the
overall
appearance
was
good
but
it
makes
it
easier
for
me
to
give
this
beer
a
4
for
appearance
rather
than
a
4
5
a
perfect
winter
beer
great
coffee
flavour
while
still
being
a
little
balanced
overall
a
solid
stout
that
i
would
defiantly
seek
out
again
if
i
had
the
chance
to
i
had
no
problem
drinking
the
entire
bomber
the
abv
was
on
the
low
side
and
it
made
this
beer
that
much
easier
to
drink
im
interested
to
see
how
this
would
taste
with
a
year
or
two
under
its
belt
but
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
tasty
coffee
stout
super
big
espresso
flavor
ive
always
found
this
to
be
a
very
good
beer
and
while
todays
offering
delivers
more
coffee
then
im
accustomed
to
i
miss
some
of
the
nuance
ive
enjoyed
in
previous
versions
o
a
drinkable
stout
with
barley
wheat
oats
amaranth
quinoa
spelt
and
kamut
as
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
in
regards
to
the
different
grains
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
have
again
interesting
bottle
picked
up
in
vancouver
a
lot
of
interesting
grains
that
yield
a
cerial
of
tastes
yet
it
doesnt
all
integrate
together
expresso
and
coffee
so
if
you
are
a
coffee
drinker
you
probably
liked
this
better
dark
and
lacey
despite
a
small
head
big
roast
above
average
mouthfeel
of
course
in
a
word
roasted
grains
aroma
has
tones
of
semisweet
chocolate
and
fine
roast
coffee
with
a
very
strong
smoky
overtone
and
a
hint
of
toffee
it
pours
a
deep
warm
sable
with
a
thick
if
not
overly
persistent
tan
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
smoky
flavor
has
roast
coffee
and
woody
tones
with
nutty
chocolate
and
toffee
hints
texture
is
smooth
and
fizzy
a
teensy
on
the
watery
side
but
still
more
than
acceptable
if
ever
you
are
in
oregon
look
for
this
one
o
a
very
tasty
oatmeal
stout
only
slight
knock
being
the
chaulkiness
but
that
is
outweighed
by
its
drinkability
and
great
flavours
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
this
is
still
a
very
solid
offering
from
the
folks
at
hub
o
a
tasty
stout
and
definitely
worthy
seeking
out
if
its
available
nice
coffee
notes
and
not
overly
bitter
the
coffee
on
the
finish
is
quite
enjoyable
this
is
one
of
the
better
6
stouts
ive
had
in
recent
memory
it
integrates
the
coffee
extremely
well
as
it
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
really
well
done
get
this
beer
good
times
a
dark
black
pour
with
a
mocha
coloured
creamy
head
the
typical
stout
aromas
of
espresso
molasses
and
heavy
roasted
malts
are
all
present
the
taste
however
is
a
little
lacking
i
find
and
comes
off
as
a
cold
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
light
and
has
a
bit
of
a
watery
feel
there
are
some
good
flavours
here
and
it
is
an
easy
drinker
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
d
this
is
my
new
favorite
beer
from
hub
excellent
i
will
be
buying
this
again
for
sure
works
for
me
for
the
most
part
but
some
of
the
extra
grains
tend
to
detract
more
than
add
in
fact
i
think
the
coffee
and
any
dark
malt
used
helps
to
mask
the
sour
astringency
of
them
if
anything
otherwise
hits
the
spot
for
a
dry
stout
overall
a
decent
enough
stout
smooth
sure
but
silky
not
so
much
the
different
grains
get
lost
in
the
mire
with
only
the
barley
wheat
and
oats
standing
out
in
their
typical
manner
if
this
thing
had
to
survive
on
the
other
four
the
whole
house
of
cards
would
come
tumbling
down
still
drinkable
and
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
a
brewing
geek
marketing
gimmick
overall
this
is
a
great
coffee
beer
and
a
good
beer
overall
the
lighter
abv
is
excellent
but
the
coffee
tends
to
become
a
bit
overwhelming
while
attempting
to
finish
the
entire
22
oz
bottle
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
its
working
well
for
me
right
now
so
id
say
its
worth
a
try
d
drinkability
is
high
easily
drank
this
bomber
over
the
course
of
studying
and
it
went
down
a
lot
easier
than
expected
really
surprising
beer
and
wish
i
could
get
more
drinkability
very
high
d
for
someone
that
has
a
hard
time
finding
stouts
i
like
this
would
rate
right
up
there
wow
what
a
way
to
take
a
coffee
stout
and
turn
it
up
a
few
notches
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
strong
roastiness
throughout
the
beer
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
trade
im
pretty
happy
with
it
but
overall
its
a
strong
bitter
coffee
stout
id
have
it
again
but
it
was
an
above
average
beer
to
me
in
a
style
that
i
have
a
hard
time
really
getting
into
i
can
appreciate
a
good
example
but
otherwise
im
fine
pours
a
near
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
a
collar
as
the
small
head
settles
down
the
nose
brings
forward
a
pretty
good
amount
of
coffee
plus
a
nice
bit
of
roasted
malt
fairlystrong
roast
throughout
the
taste
carries
this
a
bit
further
and
is
almost
a
bit
too
roasty
without
much
else
in
the
way
of
complexity
slight
coffee
presence
but
thats
about
it
feel
is
pretty
good
with
a
medium
body
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
though
there
wasnt
anything
all
that
special
about
it
i
liked
their
ipa
much
more
d
easily
a
daily
drinker
excellent
flavor
and
too
drinkable
the
smell
is
really
the
star
here
incredible
d
this
beer
represents
a
rare
achievement
in
the
world
of
stouts
brewed
with
coffeeit
allows
all
of
the
coffees
contributions
to
deliciousness
that
it
is
capable
of
providing
without
struggling
with
the
acidity
and
astringency
issues
that
are
typical
of
the
style
while
the
seven
grain
advertising
slogan
smacks
of
hipster
marketing
in
the
vein
of
dogfish
head
one
cannot
help
but
wonder
if
some
quality
of
those
grains
are
coming
together
here
to
smooth
out
the
harshest
qualities
of
the
coffee
or
do
the
talented
brewers
at
hub
simply
hold
mastery
over
that
unruly
ingredient
this
beer
works
on
so
many
levels
creepily
drinkable
restrained
abv
coffee
utilized
in
proper
manner
simple
but
elegant
brutally
tasty
my
first
beer
from
hopworks
im
impressed
excellent
beer
a
benchmark
for
those
striving
to
make
a
good
stout
overall
a
nice
brew
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
and
perhaps
some
effort
to
get
drinkable
and
sessionable
but
not
a
particularly
good
stout
there
are
a
lot
better
and
at
a
much
more
reasonable
price
drinkability
definitely
a
smooth
stout
very
balanced
nothing
prominent
which
could
also
be
a
weakness
to
some
reviewers
its
worth
drinking
and
the
organic
quality
is
a
nice
addition
dthis
is
a
very
drinkable
and
approachable
stout
d
good
oatmeal
stout
but
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
but
rather
nice
drinker
drinkability
probably
the
best
pure
coffee
stout
ive
ever
had
i
cant
remember
ever
encountering
better
coffee
flavors
and
aromas
in
a
beer
id
buy
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
id
consider
this
more
of
an
imperial
porter
based
on
the
mouthfeel
but
its
pretty
damn
good
regardless
cheers
hv
i
found
this
to
be
a
rather
average
stout
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
see
why
i
should
need
to
try
it
again
i
dig
it
very
robust
round
flavor
a
bit
more
than
a
typical
stout
in
some
areas
i
hope
they
do
an
imperial
soon

if
presented

wont
hunt
down
again
in

what

nicely
with

of

chalky

still

is
a

underwhelming
but
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
with
a
creamy
smooth
finish
overall
a
very
tasty
stout
great
flavor
and
supremely
drinkable
even
in
the
summer
austin
heat
enjoying
the
survival
stout
after
a
blackout
in
my
building
i
hate
it
here
in
nova
it
pours
a
slightly
translucent
rubyhighlighted
blackbrown
topped
by
about
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
coffee
bitter
chocolate
powder
roasted
malts
blackened
oats
and
a
dash
of
black
smoke
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
roast
and
the
coffee
with
the
toasted
oats
maintaining
the
darkness
its
nice
and
charry
without
being
overbearing
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
almost
watery
feel
overall
a
very
nice
rather
darktasting
stout
without
being
overpowering
or
too
thick
a
very
nice
very
drinkable
dark
beast
with
sessionability
to
boot
overall
this
is
a
very
good
strong
coffee
stout
that
has
strong
flavor
but
is
still
quite
smooth
mdlight
bodied
for
a
stout
with
a
little
bit
of
a
grainy
texture
as
it
goes
down
doesnt
leave
a
strong
or
bitter
aftertaste
very
enjoyable
if
you
like
coffee
pours
coffee
black
with
eggshell
colored
head
the
aroma
is
tremendously
coffeelike
which
goes
well
with
the
unexpectadly
light
body
its
hard
to
rate
this
beer
because
as
i
drink
it
i
keep
forgetting
its
a
beer
and
thinking
that
im
jst
drinking
a
cup
of
coffee
thats
gotten
cold
there
is
no
hint
of
alcohol
at
all
anywhere
in
the
taste
and
this
is
generally
very
drinkable
not
my
absolute
favorite
md
mouthfeel
is
thinner
but
still
filled
the
mouth
well
this
is
about
the

drinkable

i
have
ever

most
in

i

each
this
brew
is
extremely
tasty
light
and
easydrinking
the
flavor
is
perhaps
less
multidimensional
than
other
stouts
but
for
those
who
love
coffee
dont
hesitate
to
pick
this
one
up
d
good
d
goes
down
ok
but
ive
had
better
stouts
to
drink
this
is
roasted
and
charred
enough
that
22oz
goes
a
long
way
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
kudos
to
hub
for
unique
and
flavorpacked
stout
good

but
the
bitter
taste
really
makes
this
an
after

sipper
even
if
this
were
served
in
smaller
bottles
i
think
this
is
a
once
a
night
beer
i
have
had
this
on
tap
and
in
bottles
this
is

from

pours
a

with
a
minimal

taste
is
coffee
toffee
burnt
toast
and
some
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
pretty
good
for
a
standard
stout
a
respectable
coffee
stout
to
be
sure
in
honor
of
the
last
episode
of
24
i
wanted
to
drink
a
beer
that
summed
up
jack
bauers
life
survival
i
have
had
this
beer
in
my
cellar
for
about
10
months
now
since
bringing
it
back
from
portland
last
summer
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
very
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
almost
like
cola
huge
tan
head
formed
atop
the
jet
black
body
smell
was
like
roasted
oats
and
espresso
taste
was
excellent
heavy
grain
presence
flavors
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
barley
the
coffee
flavor
was
there
but
did
not
overwhelm
it
was
a
nice
balance
this
stout
was
not
as
thick
on
the
mouthfeel
as
i
would
have
expected
considering
the
ingredients
still
with
a
low
abv
and
a
great
smoothness
its
an
outstanding
oatmeal
stout
i
will
have
to
try
to
pick
up
more
hub
bombers
if
i
can
find
them
in
the
northwest
on
my
next
visit
this
summer
poured
from
a
bomber
this
stout
is
pitch
black
with
a
tan
head
the
7grains
are
intriguing
but
the
star
of
this
beer
is
the
stumptown
espresso
beans
the
malt
does
get
an
unusual
earthy
spicy
taste
from
all
the
grains
but
those
beans
deliver
smooth
java
taste
that
reminds
me
of
the
best
iced
coffee
ive
ever
had
stout
lovers
looking
for
something
different
or
anyone
that
likes
coffee
beer
should
check
this

for

drinking
this
beer
pours
a
nice

with
no

activity
present
after
the
pour
there
is
a
nice
two
finger
off
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
least
half
the
beer
there
is
really
no
cling
to
the
glass
either
as
far
as
the
smell
goes
i
am
picking
up
heavy
notes
of
roaste
malts
and
small
hints
of
the
oatmeal
overall
a
nice
smelling
beer
it
seems
to
set
itself
apart
a
little
from
other
stouts
in
terms
of
smell
in
regards
to
the
taste
this
is
where
the
beer
shines
it
is
front
loaded
with
a
roaste
malt
flavor
that
which
mellows
out
quite
nicely
a
good
tasting
beer
that
makes
this
a
must
drink
when
available
i
recieved
this
beer
from
madhombrwer
as
part
of
a
portland
locals
box
a
very
nice
beer
that
is
going
down
rather
well
allandall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
am
not
an
organic
i
view
it
as
an
effective
marketing
tool
and
thus
was
wary
of
this
beer
i
believe
this
survival
7grain
stout
would
make
an
excellent
session
beer
for
the
winter
months
id
love
to
have
this
on
tap
the
next
time
im
in
the
portland
or
area
this
beer
made
me
miss
shizzy
b
throwing
up
in
the
bathroom
the
last
time
we
went
to
portland
what
a
doll
pours
black
with
a
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
strong
coffee
with
some
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
strong
coffee
with
some
bitterness
as
well
as
some
chocolate
you
also
get
some
nutty
characteristics
medium
mouthfeel
but
a
little
more
watery
than
i
expected
very
drinkable
great
beer
d
very
drinkable
and
goes
down

some
hopworks
urban

continues
to
impress
this
ba
ive
now
had
three
of
their
beers
and
have
enjoyed
each
and
every
one
if
you
like
hoppy
stouts
that
also
include
coffee
survival
7grain
stout
will
do
you
right
and
wake
you
up
poured
deep
brown
to
black
with
a
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
quick
but
lacing
stays
to
the
last
drop
the
nose
has
some
clear
coffee
notes
but
also
an
underlying
earthiness
the
taste
is
pretty
complex
compared
to
your
traditonal
coffee
stout
i
love
how
the
coffee
is
present
but
not
overly
powerful
it
lacks
that
dominating
roasted
espresso
note
you
also
get
some
sweet
molasses
brown
sugar
and
milk
chocolate
in
the
taste
followed
by
a
light
balance
of
earthy
hops
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
making
it
highly
sessionable
well
done
from
a
22
oz
bottle
this
poured
a
very
dark
brown
that
looked
nearly
black
in
the
glass
with
a
foamy
and
rocky
tan
head
that
left
lacing
like
carpenters
glue
nose
is
roasted
malts
with
aromas
of
chocolate
coffee
and
grains
very
smooth
and
velvet
mouthfeel
the
flavor
is
malty
but
there
are
a
lot
of
complex
nuances
in
there
making
this
a
top
flight
stout
this
was
very
good
stout
and
is
worth
seeking
out
huge
marks
on
drinkability
the
flavor
is
great
and
the
mouthfeel
is
great
i
could
sit
and
drink
this
stuff

this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
my
first
from
this
brewery
thanks
brian
d
i
happen
to
really
like
this
one
nice
work
hopworks
as
my
glass
heads
toward
room
temperature
thing
get
even
tastier
overall
delicious
well
done
and
interesting
i
cant
say
how
all
the
unique
grains
specifically
contribute
but
the
end
product
is
great
survival
has
smooth
contours
all
around
it
is
an
ale
of
irrepressible
character
aggressive
yet
agreeable
highly
recommended
overall
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
at
the
brewery
very
drinkable
quite
sessionable
for
a
stout
very
impressive
for
all
organic
ingredients
well
done
hub
the
heat
from
the
chipotle
peppers
comes
through
as
the
beer
warms
up
especially
good
on
nitro
i
was
expecting
another
gimmicky
kind
of
beer
where
the
gimmick
advertised
cant
be
discerned
i
was
wrong
chipotle
flavor
is
noticeable
and
adds
a
nice
zing
to
an
already
decent
stout
i
had
low
expectations
but
i
was
nicely
surprised
overall
i
really
liked
this
stout
the
coffee
malt
and
chocolate
are
balanced
well
together
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
the
subdued
peppers
give
it
a
unique
taste
without
being
too
much
overall
great
beer
as
for
spiced
beers
this
and
stone
smoked
porter
with
chipotle
are
my
two
favorites
smell
is
light
all
around
but
what
comes
through
is
plum
sweet
cigar
chocolate
coffee
toasted
grain
with
a
slight
astringent
finish
flavor
is
dark
chocolate
cherry
tobacco
strong
roasted
coffee
slightly
sweet
no
bitterness
mild
chili
on
the
back
end
heat
dissipates
instantly
finish
is
dry
light
effervescence
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
wish
the
chili
lingered
a
bit
longer
but
still
a
good
beer
o
this
is
nice
because
the
spice
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
to
the
point
where
the
stout
flavors
are
dominated
would
have
like
a
little
more
roasted
qualities
but
overall
its
better
than
average
overall
a
good
winter
warmer
having
played
around
with
my
own
chile
brews
i
know
the
temptation
to
just
go
wild
with
the
spice
but
this
beer
keeps
it
on
the
quiet
and
lets
the
coffee
and
peppers
take
turns
with
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
left
me
a
bit
unimpressed
but
id
gladly
have
another
extrad
by
daveydapoolman
thanks
pours
a
deep
opaque
brownish
black
pour
yields
minimal
head
with
no
lacing
or
retention
to
speak
of
the
nose
starts
with
medium
roast
coffee
followed
by
a
hint
of
smoke
and
some
green
pepper
notes
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
are
sprinkled
in
but
coffee
and
pepper
dominate
the
nose
the
taste
starts
with
mild
acidity
presumably
from
the
coffee
this
develops
into
notes
of
chocolate
and
deep
notes
of
fresh
brewed
coffee
paired
with
smoke
the
chipotles
dont
bring
much
heat
to
the
table
but
some
definite
smoke
and
vegetal
notes
the
finish
dry
and
revisits
the
coffee
along
with
roasted
barley
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
that
could
be
so
much
better
i
think
the
brewers
went
a
little
shy
with
the
chipotles
as
heat
never
really
presents
itself
on
the
palate
ill
admit
i
was
a
little
hesitant
to
try
this
for
a
while
for
i
was
in
doubt
of
how
this
would
taste
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
lots
of
coffee
up
front
with
a
nice
spicy
kick
from
the
chipotle
in
the
tail
end
nice
and
smooth
creamy
goes
down
easy
will
definitely
be
having
one
of
these
again
o
more
than
i
was
expecting
here
my
first
beer
from
bootleggers
was
very
nice
i
see
the
ratings
are
bit
lower
than
mine
i
think
some
people
forget
this
is
not
a
imperial
stout
as
others
ba
reviews
have
eluded
to
i
see
where
this
one
is
going
but
just
misses
the
mark
on
the
flavors
of
a
big
stout
its
a
single
stout
it
hits
all
of
the
bjcp
criteria
and
its
very
flavorful
and
full
for
the
style
well
done
overall
i
liked
this
beer
i
really
dont
like
too
many
coffee
stouts
or
chipotle
stouts
or
chipotlechili
pepper
any
beer
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
think
the
roast
malts
hops
coffee
and
chipotle
was
all
balanced
very
nicely
i
think
this
beer
would
be
good
with
a
big
bowl
of
chili
on
a
cool
fall
night
watching
football
or
with
a
big
bowl
of
venison
chili
in
deer
camp
i
would
get
this
beer
again
a
solid
beer
nice
flavour
and
good
to
see
it
on
tap
in
an
airline
lounge
overall
lacked
on
most
aspects
to
me
and
ends
up
just
being
ok
to
me
overall
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
only
has
just
a
trace
amount
of
heat
to
it
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
i
was
very
much
enjoying
the
coffee
flavor
of
this
stout
definitely
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
coffee
flavored
ales
ashy
at
times
didnt
really
perceive
any
heat
of
flavor
for
the
most
part
of
my
drinking
experience
related
to
the
peppers
yes
it
does
grow
as
the
beer
warms
but
i
think
stone
has
a
cheaper
alternative
smoked
porter
w
chipotle
that
is
easier
to
find
and
better
quality
good
enough
but
wont
be
stocking
up
on
these
pours
a
black
color
with
a
half
finger
of
off
white
head
there
is
just
a
touch
of
heat
in
this
beer
until
the
finish
when
the
peppers
ramp
up
im
getting
some
coffee
but
its
more
in
the
background
than
the
peppers
just
enough
sweetness
from
the
roasted
malt
b
o
as
someone
who
loves
spice
and
coffee
this
beer
ultimately
let
me
down
with
only
moderate
coffee
notes
and
nonexistent
spice
presence
o
if
it
wasnt
for
the
crazy
high
carbonation
this
would
be
a
very
good
beer
nice
amount
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
some
pepper
burn
first
thing
i
noticed
wasnt
the
taste
but
how
this
bear
foamed
up
right
when
it
hit
my
tongue
its
highly
carbonated
the
mediumfull
body
brings
a
bunch
of
roasted
coffee
beans
right
upfront
and
through
the
midpalate
the
beer
finishes
with
the
slightest
heat
and
then
more
coffee
only
to
be
followed
by
by
a
bit
of
an
itch
in
my
throat
form
the
peppers
again
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
coffeeforward
and
comes
in
waves
quite
interesting
but
the
burps
come
in
waves
afterward
too
o
overall
this
is
one
i
would
pass
on
in
the
future
i
like
how
big
the
chipotle
heat
is
but
the
stout
flavors
and
characteristics
just
arent
there
i
appreciate
what
they
were
trying
to
do
but
its
sure
as
hell
no
mexican
cake
drink
i
enjoyed
it
i
am
just
not
a
fan
like
i
said
of
the
smoky
hot
thing
i
like
the
addition
of
the
coffee
on
this
one
and
it
was
a
good
idea
to
keep
the
abv
low
to
make
everything
a
bit
more
mellow
and
not
compete
against
the
booze
pours
black
and
has
a
rim
of
light
tan
foam
and
quite
a
bit
of
clarity
smells
of
herbal
hops
some
some
some
soily
dust
bits
of
coffee
and
some
cardboard
taste
is
empty
watered
down
stout
with
toasted
and
roated
malts
some
coffee
a
little
too
much
smoke
flavor
some
hints
of
coconut
and
weedy
mouth
is
empty
with
alittle
too
hi
carb
and
an
off
dry
finish
okay
beer
my
wife
really
dug
it
so
she
drank
most
of
the
bottle
o
i
like
my
stouts
and
porters
very
much
this
one
is
a
very
filling
and
bold
stout
i
dont
know
about
breaking
the
wallet
for
one
but
if
you
can
afford
it
go
for
it
yum
yum
yum
so
there
are
a
few
differences
between
the
nitro
and
nonnitro
versions
the
nitro
version
is
easier
to
take
while
the
nonnitro
version
fills
your
mouth
with
more
spicy
peppers
and
coffee
im
totally
taking
this
ride
again
picked
up
a
bomber
while
in
el
segundo
i
opened
the
bottle
after
dinner
and
it
makes
a
fine
dessert
beer
its
by
no
means
sweet
but
theres
a
medium
thicker
body
and
tasty
cocoa
notes
i
only
get
the
slighted
hint
of
chipotle
and
heat
once
the
beer
warms
to
cellar
temperature
but
its
a
nice
touch
this
is
definitely
not
a
beer
to
drink
too
cold
the
subtle
flavors
are
totally
lost
im
not
getting
any
noticeable
coffee
but
the
smooth
chocolate
liquor
taste
balanced
by
a
mild
roast
will
ease
your
mind
and
please
your
palate
give
this
a
try
if
you
find
it
no
false
advertising
here
it
says
chipotle
coffee
stout
on
the
bottle
and
thats
exactly
what
it
is
not
as
big
or
complex
as
i
prefer
my
stouts
but
overall
its
not
bad
at
all
no
problems
finishing
the
bottle
myself
in
one
sitting
but
not
something
ill
hunt
in
the
future
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
borderline
black
has
a
small
tan
head
scent
is
nice
and
toasty
with
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
cocoa
sweet
vanilla
and
some
cinnamon
as
well
fresh
coffee
not
really
any
chile
or
chipotle
in
the
aroma
taste
is
a
little
different
however
initially
there
is
a
definite
chile
pepper
flavor
not
heat
but
just
the
flavor
the
heat
is
very
subdued
and
only
comes
through
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
after
quite
a
few
sips
of
this
not
overwhelming
at
all
just
some
tingling
heat
that
lingers
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
the
lips
there
are
lovely
coffee
flavors
and
great
cocoa
taste
very
well
balanced
and
a
great
way
to
introduce
someone
to
what
peppers
can
do
to
a
beer
mouthfeel
is
where
this
beers
lacks
its
a
little
too
light
i
wish
i
could
try
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
mild
spicy
finish
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
beer
is
an
outstanding
chile
stout
i
would
definitely
buy
more
of
this
o
overall
this
was
just
slightly
above
average
for
me
i
like
the
addition
of
chipotle
peppers
just
wish
they
were
more
present
in
the
aroma
however
their
presence
in
the
taste
saved
this
one
for
me
d
very
drinkable
nice
stout
and
the
touch
of
hot
chipotle
is
a
nice
touch
for
some
depth
overall
if
you
dont
mind
the
light
carbonation
of
it
its
still
a
solid
drink
i
really
wish
it
had
more
carbonation
though
because
i
believe
it
would
liven
up
the
flavors
the
man
who
was
doing
the
samples
said
to
get
it
on
tap
and
i
think
itd
help
smooth
beer
very
smooth
initial
hits
of
the
coffee
flavor
den
that
lil
spicy
note
crept
up
on
me
like
all
sudden
n
stuff
kinda
like
wen
im
watchin
tha
dodgers
in
my
own
zone
n
my
girl
all
of
a
sudden
asks
me
for
a
20
to
get
her
nails
did
she
look
good
with
her
nails
did
chewy
body
with
a
good
balance
of
sweet
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
lots
of
sweet
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
along
with
hints
of
toffee
coffee
and
oatmeal
toward
the
end
of
the
palate
there
is
a
prominent
chili
pepper
spiciness
that
lingers
well
after
the
finish
chocolate
and
chili
well
integrated
creating
a
well
balanced
and
flavorful
sipper
reminds
me
of
an
artisan
chocolate
bar
bootleggers
should
only
put
this
on
nitro
its
so
much
amazingly
better
than
the
carbed
up
version
o
tasty
smells
nice
appearance
and
feel
are
less
than
perfect
would
love
to
try
at
the
source
phoenix
is
a
very
very
good
porter
especially
on
nitro
gentle
pepper
heat
and
nice
roasty
flavors
the
body
isnt
quite
up
to
the
standard
of
most
nitro
beers
but
its
good
enough
here
doa
o
could
have
been
decent
ended
up
a
blank
foamy
light
liquid
not
sure
if
a
batch
issue
or
what
but
i
see
some
reviews
eith
my
same
problem
and
some
without
the
base
porter
i
could
taste
really
was
decent
but
everything
else
sigh
overall
not
bad
and
higher
hopes
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
spicy
mocha
after
taste
overall
its
a
good
beer
and
real
easy
to
drink
i
was
just
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
chipotle
representation
in
the
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
o
this
beer
is
not
too
bad
some
good
stuff
but
there
is
all
sorts
of
bubbles
goin
on
and
its
not
helping
o
pretty
tasty
and
it
was
my
first
from
this
brewery
gotta
keep
my
eye
out
for
more
during
my
trip
to
cali
to
try
more
of
their
offerings
thanks
to
monkeymagic
for
this
poured
into
a
snifter
at
first
lots
of
carbonation
not
sure
if
thats
from
movement
during
shipping
very
black
beer
after
all
it
is
black
phoenix
could
smell
the
coffee
in
the
beer
tasted
dark
chocolate
malts
and
coffee
flavor
didnt
taste
the
chipotle
very
much
very
smokey
finish
but
just
too
carbonated
for
me
for
a
stout
but
was
overall
a
good
beer
o
pretty
interesting
fairly
tasty
worth
a
try
feels
lightish
to
medium
bodied
seems
right
for
the
style
overall
im
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
brew
i
did
have
high
hopes
and
almost
from
beginning
to
end
not
a
very
pleasant
experience
im
hoping
it
was
a
fluke
and
later
on
down
the
line
ill
get
a
bottle
that
will
impress
me
and
ill
get
to
rereview
this
beer
but
for
now
this
is
where
i
must
stand
an
overcarbonated
mess
that
was
either
past
its
prime
or
just
a
horrible
brew
looking
at
other
reviews
i
hope
its
the
former
and
not
the
latter
a
simple
though
uninteresting
chili
stoutnothing
special
but
nothing
unpleasant
either
the
postfantasy
football
draft
party
continues
here
this
stuff
pours
a
garnethighlighted
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
coffee
hickory
smoke
roasted
malts
light
dark
chocolate
and
a
rather
light
twinge
of
hot
pepper
in
the
background
im
not
entirely
certain
how
much
the
power
of
suggestion
was
at
work
here
but
i
could
swear
the
pepper
was
back
there
the
taste
holds
notes
of
mild
smoke
roasted
malts
watereddown
coffee
and
a
larger
bit
of
pepper
in
the
back
with
every
drink
the
pepper
seems
to
grow
more
powerful
similar
to
the
effect
found
in
hunahpus
just
with
different
flavors
surrounding
it
it
makes
for
an
interesting
taste
experience
believe
you
me
unfortunately
the
ancillary
flavors
are
all
kinda
weak
save
for
the
roasted
malts
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
bit
thicker
and
more
fullbodied
but
it
wasnt
too
big
a
deal
here
id
also
been
worried
that
the
pepper
had
faded
seemed
to
be
the
recent
review
consensus
but
instead
it
seemed
the
coffee
had
faded
though
this
allowed
for
a
nice
cumulative
pepper
effect
id
say
this
brew
was
a
success
regardless
just
not
a
monstrous
one
dark
brown
with
about
a
centimeter
of
light
brown
head
that
quickly
fades
away
to
a
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
certainly
not
bad
looking
as
it
rests
in
the
tulip
glass
but
not
exceptional
either
smells
of
fresh
coffee
very
subtle
chili
a
touch
of
chocolate
faint
caramel
and
some
grassy
hops
taste
is
a
little
bigger
than
the
nose
with
some
roasted
coffee
notes
up
front
roasted
chocolate
malt
caramel
lighter
hops
in
the
middle
and
a
mild
chili
flavor
in
the
very
end
for
some
reason
it
makes
me
think
of
poblano
peppers
instead
of
chipotle
which
seems
a
bit
odd
even
to
me
but
it
works
alright
mouth
is
a
bit
watery
in
between
bursts
of
flavor
feels
a
bit
undercarbonated
and
finishes
quite
dry
and
sticky
overall
a
rather
average
coffee
stout
the
addition
of
the
pepper
mixes
it
up
a
bit
but
really
doesnt
add
much
value
to
the
beer
for
me
im
certainly
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
i
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
again
d
not
sure
how
old
this
bottle
was
ive
know
chris
and
bobby
for
about
a
year
so
i
havent
had
this
bottle
for
more
than
a
few
months
hopefully
ill
get
to
try
this
fresh
and
its
a
significant
improvement
however
bootleggers
could
using
some
bottle
dating
coffee
and
pepper
flavors
seemed
to
fall
out
rather
quickly
in
this
beer
cheers
future
outlook
enjoyed
this
formeoneoff
that
i
drug
back
from
cali
doesnt
make
it
out
here
though
so
unlikely
to
encounter
again
o
this
beer
is
really
on
the
edge
of
quite
good
and
just
good
for
me
the
smell
would
be
a
lot
weaker
if
it
wasnt
for
that
smokiness
but
the
chipotle
in
that
smokiness
is
a
hard
note
to
pick
out
furthermore
the
taste
is
a
bit
tame
considering
the
ingredients
the
chocolate
and
coffee
is
there
but
the
chipotle
is
done
with
a
pretty
light
hand
lastly
the
body
is
saved
by
the
creamy
sensation
of
smokey
adobo
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
lot
of
saving
graces
in
each
category
definitely
worth
trying
and
i
think
bootleggers
have
a
decent
starting
recipe
to
a
much
better
beer
o
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
good
mix
of
flavors
but
i
think
it
was
a
little
simplistic
and
straightforward
and
underplayed
its
most
interesting
ingredient
chipotle
worth
picking
up
if
you
like
the
aforementioned
flavors
not
worth
picking
up
if
youre
looking
for
an
intense
pepper
experience
or
just
something
complex
and
new
hats
off
to
bootleggers
though
as
everything
ive
had
from
them
so
far
has
at
least
been
good
overall
i
really
really
really
like
this
beer
as
i
am
writing
this
i
actually
just
cracked
another
one
i
like
it
so
much
the
peppers
are
noticeable
but
are
very
well
balanced
the
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
really
give
this
beer
a
great
flavor
overall
an
ok
beer
not
bad
worth
a
try
might
have
it
again
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
think
its
a
very
tasty
stout
like
i
said
before
the
coffee
in
this
is
better
than
some
ive
had
before
it
seems
to
be
very
well
integrated
the
chipotle
adds
a
weird
angle
once
you
have
a
glass
or
two
and
start
to
realize
its
there
enjoyable
brew
d
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
after
reading
the
description
fails
to
deliver
on
the
promise
of
chipotle
coffee
was
decent
but
couldnt
carry
this
beer
on
its
own
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
dark
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
random
spots
of
lacing
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
coffee
beans
and
a
smokiness
from
the
chipotle
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
with
a
nice
roasty
pepper
taste
that
lingers
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
the
body
on
this
beer
is
somewhat
light
for
a
stout
though
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
and
i
really
like
the
smoked
chipotle
aroma
and
flavor
found
in
this
beer
a
large
medium
tan
headed
formed
atop
the
pitch
black
body
good
retention
aroma
includes
smoky
bqq
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
heavy
focus
on
the
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
earthy
clean
ferrmentation
nonthreatening
moderate
level
of
bitterness
carbonation
level
seems
slightly
high
mediumbodied
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
pretty
bitter
at
the
back
lots
of
roasted
coffee
coming
up
in
this
one
overall
the
beer
has
this
mildly
dry
finish
and
on
that
desert
of
a
palate
remains
this
slight
smoky
heat
interesting
the
chili
flavor
comes
out
the
more
i
drink
it
the
stronger
it
gets
but
it
never
get
overwhelming
it
is
just
resting
there
in
the
background
popping
up
to
remind
you
this
isnt
a
porter
it
is
a
chile
beer
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
but
i
did
enjoy
it
d
fun
to
try
taste
is
bittersweet
chocolate
and
some
decent
coffee
roastiness
the
chipotle
addition
is
more
of
a
light
smokeash
presence
as
opposed
to
spicy
pepperiness
which
is
fine
by
me
as
i
typically
have
not
enjoyed
any
of
the
other
beers
i
have
had
with
chipotle
mouthfeel
is
less
than
full
but
enough
and
certainly
not
thin
good
beer
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
but
it
is
a
very
nice
little
coffee
stout
here
makes
me
want
to
try
some
more
offerings
from
bootleggers
nice
and
low
abv
makes
it
that
much
more
enjoyable
this
is
most
certainly
reminiscent
of
a
stout
like
bootleggers
claims
however
classifying
this
as
a
chile
beer
here
is
wrong
imo
nonetheless
this
is
probably
the
best
example
ive
seen
of
how
to
properly
use
chipotle
peppers
in
a
beer
they
should
not
be
the
focus
instead
blended
with
other
flavors
that
will
play
well
off
each
other
something
bootleggers
has
done
drank
most
of
a
tulip
glass
at
pizza
port
in
ocean
beach
san
diego
o
slightly
above
average
its
a
bit
mild
on
the
chipotle
side
but
its
still
there
and
in
that
regard
a
good
intro
for
the
chile
beer
style
imho
still
pretty
solid
and
ive
enjoyed
it
when
ive
had
it
so
far
its
been
my
favorite
offering
from
bootleggers
viewed
as
a
sweet
stout
vs
this
chile
nonsense
yet
still
quite
marginal
overall
bottom
line
yet
another
overpriced
wannabe
check
please
this
was
an
exceptional
surprise
i
was
expecting
to
have
just
another
tick
but
this
beer
is
actually
quite
good
i
would
gladly
drink
another
the
aroma
of
rich
dark
coffee
dominates
this
brew
with
a
slight
chipotle
coming
up
in
the
back
end
in
the
taste
department
you
get
a
lot
of
coffee
at
first
i
think
if
this
was
marketed
as
a
coffee
brew
alone
it
would
be
fantastic
but
the
chili
pepper
is
under
done
a
bit
there
was
some
but
i
really
had
to
think
about
it
to
pick
it
out
i
think
it
just
needs
a
touch
more
chili
the
concept
was
great
but
it
didnt
quite
come
thru
for
me
smells
like
a
porter
with
a
few
muted
coffee
notes
and
peppers
tastes
decent
but
the
chipotle
part
isnt
really
doing
it
for
me
im
almost
getting
an
ashtray
taste
hiding
behind
the
peppers
i
still
drank
the
bottle
but
not
sure
id
get
this
one
again
overall
a
decent
chipotle
brew
smooth
mellow
yet
just
enough
character
to
keep
me
interested
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
more
of
these
easily
mouthed
rauchiness
a
thin
beer
not
too
hearty
a
small
bit
o
chipotle
an
odd
combination
that
could
work
with
perhaps
a
bit
more
sweetness
or
malty
creaminess
6
7
it
is
decent
to
try
the
once
but
nothing
i
will
try
again
unless
on
tap
or
cask
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
a
great
late
night
beer
as
i
am
enjoying
right
right
now
handled
in
moderation
absolutely
nothing
i
would
ever
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
a
pedestrian
stout
with
a
dash
of
pepper
i
dont
like
chile
beer
sin
general
and
this
one
didnt
change
my
mind
d
ill
admit
i
have
fall
in
love
with
add
a
dash
of
chipotle
to
beers
ive
brewed
my
own
chipotle
ale
turned
out
great
its
a
great
twist
on
a
all
ready
good
porter
or
maybe
its
masking
some
of
its
bad
traits
who
knows
i
def
plan
to
drink
more
of
this
although
after
one
you
might
be
running
a
risk
of
heart
burn
overall
this
is
a
good
nice
drinkable
stout
with
a
hint
of
chili
spice
i
like
it
a
lot
even
though
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
spice
kick
overall
decent
beer
it
could
be
awesome
if
it
wasnt
so
roasted
somewhat
drinkable
to
wrap
this
up
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
like
this
beer
i
think
it
could
just
be
the
bottle
that
gave
this
beer
the
lacking
smell
and
taste
i
would
love
to
get
a
nice
big
glass
of
this
right
from
the
tap
my
local
beer
stores
here
in
san
diego
are
selling
a
22oz
bottle
of
this
for
5
99
i
think
this
is
very
reasonable
price
considering
the
expensive
ingredients
that
went
into
making
this
darkness
i
would
say
if
you
like
dark
beers
with
coffee
and
have
never
tried
one
with
chipotle
peppers
than
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
and
enjoy
vigorous
pour
gets
you
two
plus
fingers
of
creamy
dark
brown
foam
all
microbubbles
with
a
uniformly
flat
surface
you
can
see
hundreds
of
bubbles
popping
at
once
as
it
simmers
down
to
the
surface
with
ease
the
foam
glides
down
the
glass
sides
in
solid
sheets
no
lacing
as
expected
the
liquid
is
pure
jet
black
without
a
trace
of
color
appears
to
have
no
haziness
wastes
no
time
unleashing
the
chipotle
peppers
albeit
the
heavily
roasted
coffee
beans
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
follows
up
with
lactose
cumin
and
coriander
spice
over
time
the
pepper
recedes
in
favor
of
earth
muddy
straw
and
cigar
ash
mediumbodied
firm
and
muscular
the
weak
carbonation
would
surprise
if
you
only
viewed
the
glass
after
the
pour
and
not
minutes
later
when
there
is
absolutely
no
bubbles
to
found
anywhere
as
a
result
the
heat
and
spice
are
able
to
soak
in
and
maintain
as
consistent
a
presence
as
the
bitter
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
milk
cream
except
for
the
burn
theres
no
real
roughness
smooth
enough
overall
texture
oatmeal
corn
bread
biscuit
breadiness
is
doughy
and
not
that
sweet
momentary
touch
of
orange
peel
any
greenness
is
akin
to
tea
leaves
or
tobacco
wrappers
not
particularly
complex
but
does
show
determination
in
getting
its
few
words
across
d
this
is
a
really
good
chile
beer
the
chipotle
isnt
as
in
your
face
as
i
have
experienced
with
other
chile
beers
instead
the
are
more
subtle
and
complementary
in
their
use
big
thanks
to
maxstout
for
sending
this
to
my
doorstep
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
that
featured
some
roastiness
chocolate
and
chipotle
peppers
i
just
just
wished
the
chipotle
character
was
more
potent
throughout
still
drank
good
and
was
a
decent
brew
it
was
drinkable
at
approx
six
percent
and
felt
alright
in
the
boca
pretty
please
the
palate
is
also
pretty
good
heavy
on
the
grainybready
malt
and
dark
roasted
coffee
light
on
the
chipotle
flavor
and
heat
the
beer
grows
in
complexity
as
it
warms
bringing
the
chipotle
flavor
closer
to
the
forefront
the
finish
is
roasty
and
mildly
hot
which
lingers
nicely
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
id
like
but
hefty
enough
this
was
surprisingly
enjoyable
hv
o
nice
beer
overall
ill
definitely
be
sampling
another
to
see
if
i
just
got
an
off
bottle
d
i
couldnt
drink
this
all
day
but
its
quite
nice
one
bomber
is
probably
good
for
me
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
now
d
okay
this
is
an
okay
coffee
stout
but
with
the
light
almost
unnoticeable
pepper
flavor
and
heat
its
just
a
little
bit
weird
drinkability
damn
drinkable
and
for
how
cheap
this
beer
is
a
definite
repeat
bootleggers
continues
to
impress
d
for
5
its
wellpriced
and
its
tastier
than
a
number
of
traditional
stouts
id
buy
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
i
get
chocolate
coffee
smoke
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
smoke
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
pepper
flavor
or
aroma
but
i
get
the
smoke
from
the
chipotles
very
nice
beer
very
dark
pour
with
a
huge
tan
head
on
top
a
lot
of
foam
at
first
that
quickly
receedes
into
nice
fluffy
head
mocha
and
chocolate
aroma
upfront
bit
of
roasted
graininess
mildly
metallic
improves
as
it
warms
aroma
wise
big
roasted
mocha
and
chocolatey
flavors
with
a
decent
level
of
roasted
grains
the
chile
peppers
tend
to
come
thru
near
the
end
with
a
pleasant
bite
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
coffee
is
more
of
an
afterthought
herehence
the
mocha
flavor
over
straight
coffee
smooth
and
velvety
mouthfeel
for
the
most
parta
bit
acrid
in
the
finish
very
enjoyable
and
well
balanced
between
the
ingredients
in
here
dat
only
6
7
its
pretty
easy
drinking
im
really
loving
how
the
peppers
and
coffee
shine
in
their
own
ways
and
compliment
each
other
this
beer
is
really
bad
big
fail
for
bootleggers
made
it
through
about
an
inch
of
this
beer
before
the
rest
went
down
the
drain
dark
brown
to
black
beer
without
head
my
nose
is
greeted
with
pleasing
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
aromas
immediately
also
a
certain
milky
creaminess
and
a
little
smoke
very
chocolaty
taste
i
wouldnt
put
this
in
the
chile
beer
catagory
at
all
even
though
chiles
are
used
would
we
put
wrath
of
pecant
in
the
plantain
catagory
just
because
they
are
used
you
know
what
i
mean
there
isnt
much
chile
or
spice
to
this
beer
at
all
maybe
a
hint
of
chipotle
late
in
the
swallow
it
could
much
easier
pass
as
a
coffee
stout
its
clean
with
quite
active
carbonation
its
enjoyable
but
you
know
what
not
to
expect
nicely
done
id
drink
this
again
d
good
nice
drinkable
stout
with
a
hint
of
chili
i
like
it
a
lot
this
one
is
pretty
good
actually
interesting
and
worth
a
second
look
hopefully
that
chlorine
smell
was
just
my
imagination
pours
a
deep
rich
black
color
with
a
nice
dense
brown
head
coffee
is
prevalent
on
the
nose
along
with
dark
chocolate
and
just
a
hint
of
the
promised
chipotle
tastes
like
a
big
roasty
porter
with
hints
of
coffee
smoke
chocolate
and
chipotle
as
the
beer
warms
i
start
to
feel
a
little
more
of
the
heat
coming
through
a
very
nice
effort
smooth
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
wasnt
the
best
example
of
a
chile
stout
ive
had
however
it
didnt
skimp
on
the
chile
flavor
like
some
others
ive
had
either
worth
a
shot
dthis
is
a
great
stout
i
actually
am
not
a
huge
chile
beer
guy
and
would
prefer
the
chilies
not
in
this
to
take
away
that
peppery
spice
but
knowing
that
is
what
they
wanted
the
rest
of
the
stout
properties
are
great
big
flavors
nice
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
a
little
sweetness
at
the
finish
with
a
very
solid
body
id
love
to
try
a
regular
or
even
better
an
imperial
stout
d
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
for
the
style
that
is
from
talking
to
people
it
seems
they
have
dialed
back
the
chipotle
component
and
its
for
the
better
of
the
beer
its
not
spicy
but
does
have
a
little
kick
that
said
it
wasnt
my
favorite
beer
but
an
interesting
one
to
try
wont
be
revisiting
this
is
a
very
complex
and
original
stout
with
the
peppers
really
bringing
something
different
to
the
table
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
overall
this
was
pretty
damn
solid
i
have
to
say
nothing
really
over
the
top
and
the
pepper
really
balanced
well
against
the
coffee
playing
off
each
other
very
nicely
a
solid
brew
from
top
to
bottom
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
medium
amount
of
head
strong
coffee
aroma
and
light
nutty
and
chile
aromas
slightly
spicy
front
end
followed
by
powerful
coffeestoutish
flavors
on
the
back
end
light
to
moderate
sweetness
low
carbonationvery
smooth
going
down
typical
of
style
d
pretty
drinkable
actually
which
is
surprising
for
a
coffeechipotle
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
though
not
all
that
high

begin
with

real
well
with
our
sweet
and
hot
pepper
cheddar
d
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
would
really
comsume
in
a
night
probably
just
one
this
is
tasty
beer
and
very
unique
but
like
all
spicy
foods
the
more
you
drink
the
more
chipotle
you
taste
the
burn
is
not
intense
but
it
is
there
one
and
done
for
me
notes
i
could
definitely
see
how
some
people
would
love
this
beer
if
what
youre
looking
for
is
some
smoky
spiciness
in
your
american
stout
then
this
is
probably
your
holy
grail
personally
as
much
as
i
liked
the
aroma
it
just
didnt
float
my
boat
when
it
hit
my
palate
still
excited
to
see
a
bootleggers
brew
in
a
local
shop
gotta
support
the
locals
d
a
very
nice
beer
from
bootleggers
both
of
the
local
north
county
breweries
have
made
a
chile
beer
and
both
have
turned
out
to
be
really
good
check
this
effort
out
served
on
tap
at
the
verdugo
bar
this
beer
came
out
black
as
night
with
only
a
trace
of
head
that
quickly
fizzled
away
a
little
disappointing
until
i
got
a
whiff
the
nose
was
a
big
hit
of
coffee
i
dont
particularly
care
for
coffee
by
itself
but
i
love
me
some
coffee
in
my
beer
this
one
did
not
disappoint
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
fresh
ground
coffee
perfectly
blended
with
roasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
spice
at
the
end
the
chipotle
takes
a
back
seat
in
this
beer
with
the
coffee
up
front
and
then
a
nice
touch
of
spice
in
the
finish
complimenting
the
beer
instead
of
overpowering
it
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
a
medium
body
i
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
if
the
verdugo
didnt
have
so
many
great
beers
to
try
overall
this
was
an
excellent
beer
well
balanced
and
extremely
drinkable
ill
be
looking
for
more
of
these
in
the
future
recommended
for
the
locals
if
you
arent
keeping
up
with
bootleggers
you
are
going
to
get
left
behind
i
have
tasted
this
a
couple
times
on
draft
as
well
the
the
local
roasted
coffee
stood
out
more
intense
and
delicious
i
plan
on
putting
up
another
review
for
the
growler
format
soon
22
ounce
bottle
purchased
from
hitimes
for
4
49
saw
this
one
last
bottle
on
the
shelf
and
snagged
it
out
of
curiousity
split
with
my
dad
tonight
as
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
style
poured
into
my
stone
pint
glass
color
is
very
dark
brown
big
1
12
inch
creamy
tan
head
some
lacing
at
the
top
decent
retention
too
aroma
consists
of
mostly
coffee
bit
of
chipotle
shining
through
but
nothing
like
i
expected
as
far
as
the
scent
from
the
peppers
also
some
roasted
malts
smokiness
toffee
and
dark
chocolate
taste
starts
off
with
a
slightly
sweet
coffee
flavor
fades
into
some
malt
in
the
middle
that
is
a
little
roasted
finish
is
the
same
but
a
mild
burning
sensation
from
the
peppers
once
this
beer
warms
up
you
can
taste
them
more
but
not
much
at
any
point
not
like
other
chile
beers
i
have
had
in
the
past
at
least
roasted
slightly
sweet
and
spicy
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
taste
lingers
well
could
have
drank
this
bomber
but
not
much
after
that
pretty
heavy
for
how
low
the
abv
is
sweet
and
spicy
at
times
which
can
throw
the
stomach
for
a
loop
still
decent
drinkability
considering
its
style
would
drink
again
this
was
a
limited
release
according
to
the
label
but
i
hope
to
see
it
again
recommended
very
rich
coffee
and
spicy
rye
flavor
deep
roast
creamy
body
in
a
relatively
low
abv
package
totally
satisfying
not
the
least
bit
thin
or
watery
would
work
nicely
with
a
light
barrel
treatment
or
as
a
hearty
breakfast
beer
the
color
is
black
opaque
with
thick
light
tan
head
cream
head
the
smell
has
a
slight
cocoapuff
type
sweet
odor
with
mild
malt
roast
and
dry
burnt
toast
flavor
up
front
good
bittering
hop
balance
not
much
dark
chocolate
or
coffee
but
this
is
still
very
flavorful
reminds
me
of
nearly
burnt
toast
rather
full
busy
for
the
style
but
the
bubbles
balance
it
out
well
o
unique
stout
that
is
worthy
of
a
try
the
beer
is
black
with
an
inch
of
beige
cap
the
aroma
brings
big
dark
roast
chocolate
light
spice
a
touch
of
hops
the
flavor
offers
a
big
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
bill
with
hints
of
coffee
and
smoke
rye
character
emerges
mid
to
late
palate
and
really
adds
a
nice
touch
medium
to
full
bodied
and
smooth
a
delicious
beer
id
have
this
again
baume
has
always
been
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
in
my
eyes
and
one
i
pick
up
multiple
times
each
year
theres
great
depth
especially
with
the
spicy
rye
and
a
bold
hopping
good
looks
great
flavors
and
high
drinkability
wraps
up
this
7
stout
heres
to
half
acre
overall
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
barely
a
stout
o
very
enjoyable
rye
beers
are
so
unique
and
this
is
a
good
example
the
flavors
mostly
roasted
coffee
and
rye
mesh
well
the
aroma
hinted
at
a
little
more
than
was
there
in
the
flavor
powerful
aftertaste
i
like
a
good
dry
bitter
stout
though
this
comes
close
to
a
scotch
ale
every
now
and
then
glad
i
had
it
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
sessionable
in
my
opinion
it
clocks
in
at
only
6
5
stated
on
the
bottle
so
a
bomber
is
easy
to
finish
up
myself
i
like
the
flavors
but
i
love
smell
o
this
is
so
nearly
a
good
beer
nailed
the
appearance
scent
even
mouthfeel
but
the
generic
bitterness
held
it
back
next
time
i
want
a
beer
like
this
ill
be
reaching
for
wookey
jack
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
rye
and
cocoa
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
rye
and
cocoa
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
smells
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
o
a
nicely
done
rye
stout
if
you
dont
like
the
flavor
it
scent
if
rye
why
drink
a
rye
stout
after
all
i
would
have
like
a
bit
more
layering
of
flavors
but
overall
a
very
solid
beer
brewreport

com
verdict
a
nice
easy
stout
from
half
acre
its
not
in
your
face
but
it
doesnt
hide
anything
either
very
sessionable
and
enjoyable
as
a
nightcap
after
having
this
and
hearths
ablaze
i
am
really
beginning
to
enjoy
their
lighter
american
stouts
solid
effort
overall
i
like
the
flavors
but
it
could
use
some
more
rye
wish
it
was
thicker
too
i
would
have
this
again
o
very
different
a
light
dry
stout
with
a
different
take
not
as
complex
as
it
could
be
but
certainly
off
the
beaten
path
probably
not
a
beer
id
frequent
but
definitely
enjoyed
this
is
a
pretty
nice
stout
that
hits
some
unusual
notes
with
the
rye
and
more
prominent
hops
than
youd
expect
not
the
usual
fare
and
a
nice
changeup
from
that
definitely
worth
a
flyer
o
pretty
enjoyable
stout
the
rye
and
hops
are
a
bit
bracing
even
after
the
aging
but
i
think
it
works
with
the
beer
a
superior
stout
from
chicago
trip
of
5
months
back
well
features
rye
spicy
characteristic
hops
not
overpowering
and
lending
some
citrus
to
the
chocolate
flavour
some
ageing
probably
helping
there
very
creamy
thick
lasting
head
thick
chocolate
a
nice
drinker
o
super
spicy
for
what
it
is
its
awesome
but
you
gotta
love
rye
thanks
again
jbck109
o
a
nice
stout
but
not
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
the
rye
and
hops
are
just
a
bit
too
much
for
me
even
though
i
love
both
and
i
think
id
rather
have
a
porter
or
brown
then
go
back
to
this
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
dark
decent
d
a
nice
stout
for
sure
balanced
and
easy
drinking
well
done
o
decent
stout
not
on
the
same
level
as
big
hugs
in
my
opinion
but
that
is
an
imperial
stout
of
course
rye
adds
a
nice
accent
not
dominant
in
any
way
not
sure
id
seek
this
out
again
but
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
o
i
liked
the
flavors
the
rye
incorporated
it
didnt
dominate
the
chocolate
flavors
of
the
stout
and
it
really
balanced
everything
out
o
this
a
fine
american
stout
as
far
as
regular
non
whatever
barrel
aged
stouts
go
this
is
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
had
o
never
had
anyhting
like
this
that
being
said
i
would
like
to
try
more
rye
chocolate
stouts
this
is
a
really
smooth
but
complex
brew
probably
the
best
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
cost
7
99
for
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
o
very
good
regular
stout
like
the
citrus
hop
aroma
and
taste
will
buy
this
one
yearly
this
is
a
quality
stout
well
balanced
and
while
not
extremely
complex
it
hits
the
notes
really
well
and
is
really
enjoyable
digging
the
dark
malt
flavors
combined
with
a
pepperyrye
bread
spice
firm
bitterness
helps
balance
the
brew
while
lending
a
drinkability
that
keeps
me
back
for
another
sip
the
type
of
beer
id
love
to
have
easier
access
to
and
another
impressive
offering
from
a
brewery
that
keeps
churning
out
winners
edit
it
did
cross
my
path
2012
version
a
few
months
old
out
of
the
bottle
much
more
rye
heavy
awesome
bittersweet
cocoa
roastiness
throughout
similar
to
everett
by
hf
i
know
strange
comparison
in
its
lingering
delicious
aftertaste
a
great
improvement
over
last
year
for
me
overall
i
really
enjoyed
my
first
half
acre
offering
i
dont
believe
this
was
brewed
or
designed
to
blow
my
socks
off
or
to
be
the
next
great
want

nice

good
beer
i
like
everything
about
only
issue
was
that
it
was
served
way
to
cold
once
it
warmed
a
little
i
got
more
of
the
flavors
and
aroma
i
was
expecting
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
this
stout
was
on
the
lighter
side
the
finish
was
a
bit
thin
meh
expecting
a
bigger
bourbon
note
draught
into
a
snifter
beautiful
deep
dark
brown
only
beer
ive
ever
rated
a
5
overall
as
i
absolutely
loved
it
coffee
and
great
bourbon
flavor
and
the
toastiness
gives
it
a
great
depth
of
flavor
my
personal
favorite
of
all
of
the
bbss
ive
tried
ok
for
an
everyday
beer
but
more
girlie
than
i
prefer
pours
a
deep
deep
brown
without
a
light
overhead
it
looks
black
it
has
a
thick
light
tan
head
that
settles
down
and
leaves
some
nice
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
big
bourbon
goodness
it
doesnt
have
the
vanilla
or
oaky
but
the
bourbon
sweetness
there
is
also
a
little
dark
roasted
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
robust
but
both
the
aroma
qualities
are
present
it
almost
tastes
as
though
someone
dropped
a
shot
in
the
beer
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
but
the
two
flavors
dont
meld
a
seamlessly
as
other
barrelaged
beers
the
body
is
lighter
in
weight
as
well
not
as
thick
or
oily
just
short
of
great
this
is
the
first
bba
beer
i
considered
pouring
down
the
drain
a
good
drinking
bourbon
stout
as
the
flavor
doesnt
drive
you
away
if
your
not
a
whiskey
drinker
too
thin
for
my
stout
preference
but
drinkable
for
its
lighter
abv
good
intro
stout
like
a
piece
of
buttered
toast
just
a
hint
of
whiskey
and
a
real
bargain
compared
to
most
barrel
aged
stouts
this
beer
made
me
happy
not
an
huge
fan
of
this
beer
too
thin
too
much
bourbon
for
the
low
svc
and
no
real
presence
of
the
base
beer
rather
have
had
a
shot
of
wild
turkey
instead
overall
its
a
little
too
bourboney
but
for
the
most
part
is
a
very
welldone
beer
will
not
seek
out
or
purchase
again
i
will
try
a
few
more
barrel
aged
style
beers
though
to
see
if
it
was
the
style
or
just
this
one
that
i
didnt
like
look
is
a
dark
dark
brown
smell
roasted
chocolate
malt
smell
bourbon
with
some
raisin
s
on
the
nose
lots
of
vanilla
taste
is
a
really
nice
roasted
chocolate
with
bitter
caramel
and
vanilla
dark
chocolate
covered
coconut
feel
light
body
watery
bitterness
hangs
around
a
lil
bit
overall
this
is
not
your
typical
bbs
it
is
6
5
which
is
cool
because
you
could
drink
the
whole
bottle
it
is
not
overly
sweet
and
heavy
it
has
the
complexity
of
your
typical
bourbon
barrel
beer
which
is
pretty
awesome
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
bought
a
couple
and
going
to
try
aging
a
couple
see
how
a
low
abv
handles
a
cellar
i
had
this
beer
on
draft
and
it
was
served
a
little
to
cold
the
beer
is
very
dark
and
has
a
nice
dark
chocolate
milk
colored
head
a
little
disappointed
on
the
aroma
and
flavor
this
beer
had
no
bourbon
barrel
aroma
or
flavor
if
they
had
left
out
the
name
than
bourbon
barrel
i
would
not
have
cared
the
beer
is
delicious
but
when
you
put
something
in
the
name
it
leads
the
consumer
to
expect
it
i
did
get
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
but
no
bourbon
notes
so
maybe
it
did
do
some
time
in
some
oak
great
beer
but
disappointed
on
the
bourbon
thing
the
bar
charged
alot
for
this
beer
that
doesnt
even
have
hops
in
it
and
didnt
taste
like
it
spent
doing
any
hard
time
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
easy
to
drink
smooth
as
others
have
said
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
had
on
tap
slight
ring
of
foam
i
was
expecting
something
more
leaves
you
feeling
like
it
is
missing
something
great
stout
full
bodied
and
deliciously
smooth
were
there
rankings
higher
i
would
use
them
i
think
this
whole
effect
would
be
better
served
by
taking
a
shot
of
whiskey
and
dropping
it
in
a
stout
duh
then
you
would
have
some
extra
kick
too
im
going
to
try
that
some
time
soon
this
is
2nd
time
ive
had
this
from
tap
and
was
hoping
it
would
change
my
mind
but
its
very
thin
hardly
any
bb
smell
or
taste
drinks
more
like
a
porter
decent
but
not
great
incredibly
smooth
great
french
vanilla
flavor
and
perfect
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
hard
to
finish
the
bottle
doesnt
live
up
to
mid
level
bourbon
beers
out
there
pour
is
black
with
a
lot
of
tan
head
a
good
bit
of
bubbles
and
a
lot
of
lacing
nose
has
some
scorched
wood
moderate
bourbon
notes
light
roasted
malt
taste
is
a
bit
thin
barrel
fades
in
flavor
some
chocolaty
malt
a
touch
chalky
light
vanilla
body
is
a
touch
thin
soft
carb
soft
and
creamy
feel
on
tap
at
howells
and
hood
all
i
can
say
is
were
spoiled
in
wisconsin
enjoy
damn
good
stout
beer
yup
tobacco
overwhelms
everything
on
the
dry
side
chocolate
and
vanilla
and
a
little
cooked
sugar
for
good
measure
on
both
the
tongue
and
nose
as
expected
with
a
barrel
aged
stout
not
as
much
alcohol
as
i
expected
from
a
turkeybarrelaged
beer
so
it
lacks
a
little
of
the
typical
warmth
but
i
dont
really
miss
it
here
it
is
an
exceedingly
pleasant
brew
that
i
feel
would
be
a
great
introduction
to
the
breed
it
is
not
the
heavier
fuller
bodied
more
potent
example
i
can
sip
on
for
an
entire
football
game
but
it
can
be
nursed
for
a
really
good
half
as
a
matter
of
fact
buy
2
and
make
it
a
full
game
you
can
enjoy
win
or
lose
perfect
for
the
cool
winter
evenings
of
the
south
since
it
isnt
quite
as
heavy
as
expected
worthy
of
a
purchase
for
sure
wow
this
is
an
incredibly
complex
beer
that
manages
to
unite
two
of
my
favorite
beverages
the
nose
is
heavy
on
vanilla
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
a
mouthful
of
this
beer
starts
with
the
appropriate
stout
dark
malts
and
moves
to
a
very
enjoyable
bourbon
finish
the
undertones
of
oak
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
combine
to
create
a
very
unique
taste
experience
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tasted
in
the
last
year
more
bba
than
beer
cant
stand
wild
turkey
so
i
was
skeptical
however
this
beer
hit
all
the
right
notes
for
me
bourbon
ties
perfectly
with
the
blarney
flats
body
and
flavor
thats
some
bahl
hornin
rich
flavor
able
full
bodied
complex
bourbon
malt
flavor
works
really
well
overall
there
are
just
way
too
many
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
to
waste
your
time
on
this
one
if
this
is
your
first
and
you
like
it
all
the
others
are
better
taste
some
bitterness
up
front
light
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
carbonation
is
well
balanced
but
watered
down
light
vanilla
and
toffee
with
a
very
faint
hint
of
alcohol
hotness
at
the
end
poured
a
darker
black
this
beer
smells
absolutely
delicious
smells
of
bourbon
and
vanilla
you
can
smell
it
as
soon
as
you
crack
the
bottle
open
i
was
expecting
more
in
the
taste
department
it
is
a
smooth
beer
bourbon
and
vanilla
dominate
the
taste
it
almost
tastes
watered
down
though
most
bourbon
barrel
stouts
are
over
the
top
and
a
bomber
will
knock
you
off
your
feet
at
first
i
didnt
like
this
one
because
it
wasnt
that
by
the
end
of
the
bomber
though
it
won
me
over
overall
much
like
their
pinchy
jeek
barl
effort
the
bourbon
barrels
really
dominate
everything
about
the
beer
o
i
am
a
big
fan
of
anderson
valley
and
their
oatmeal
stout
this
one
may
surpass
it
as
my
favorite
stout
they
make
really
great
flavor
combination
and
the
bourbon
is
used
in
a
way
that
isnt
overpowering
but
really
compliments
the
chocolate
toffee
caramel
mix
under
7
alcohol
as
well
so
this
is
an
incredibly
sessionable
beer
that
wont
weigh
you
down
like
traditional
imperial
stouts
or
bb
stouts
very
impressed
not
real
often
you
come
across
a
barrel
aged
stout
thats
comes
in
under
7
abv
but
carries
this
much
flavor
and
mouthfeel
i
love
it
not
a
huge
wild
turkey
fan
myself
and
the
specific
character
of
the
whiskey
comes
through
a
lot
in
this
beer
but
it
seems
to
work
frothy
look
soft
grayish
brown
head
on
a
dark
chocolate
colored
body
with
good
viscosity
and
so
e
clinging
density
nose
is
whiskey
first
thin
vanilla
and
booze
with
sweet
oak
milk
chocolate
and
derived
fruit
maybe
raisin
leading
the
way
in
the
flavor
oats
might
froth
this
up
a
little
chocolate
malt
is
robust
and
the
oak
is
long
lasting
in
the
finish
its
great
because
all
the
booze
and
body
of
the
huge
imperials
is
here
right
there
to
enjoy
from
first
sip
but
it
never
gets
hit
and
heavy
allowing
me
to
consume
way
more
of
this
than
i
could
some
imperial
props
to
anderson
valley
for
putting
this
one
together
its
perfect
this
time
of
year
a
touch
of
acidity
in
the
finish
is
my
only
complaint
i
would
describe
this
as
a
very
sessionable
bourbon
maybe
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
stout
but
on
the
whole
a
very
enjoyable
drink
amazing
stout
if
youre
a
fan
of
bourbon
or
a
fan
of
the
rich
malty
stout
this
is
the
one
for
you
pours
thick
and
black
with
a
dark
head
dark
chestnut
colored
with
a
beige
head
that
sizzles
as
it
rises
up
and
recedes
quickly
low
aroma
of
bourbon
and
dark
malt
rich
flavor
of
darkly
toasted
malt
not
roasty
subtle
woody
notes
bourbon
hints
and
vanilla
bourbon
is
understated
no
hop
flavor
but
firm
bitterness
offsets
the
malt
somewhat
thin
body
dry
and
talcy
a
carbonation
tingle
finishes
woody
notes
linger
good
but
not
great
this
one
was
difficult
to
rate
many
bourbon
barrel
stouts
are
so
high
on
the
abv
there
is
a
lot
more
going
on
this
one
is
smooth
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
the
barrel
notes
do
shine
through
and
mix
well
with
the
already
sweet
taste
i
like
this
beer
but
its
not
amazing
something
i
might
drink
as
a
stout
i
can
have
a
handful
of
worth
giving
a
try
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
ok
at
best
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
average
example
of
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
stout
the
stout
base
was
thin
watery
and
not
to
flavorful
and
it
got
overpowered
by
the
bourbon
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
it
wasnt
too
smooth
crisp
a
little
watery
not
filling
and
the
taste
couldnt
hold
my
attention
one
glass
was
more
than
enough
for
me
a
whole
bottle
would
be
too
much
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
nice
looking
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
it
wasnt
good
and
the
stout
base
needed
to
be
beefed
up
a
little
to
balance
out
all
those
boozy
bourbon
flavors
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
i
just
dont
think
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
in
the
end
it
left
me
wanting
a
lot
more
out
of
the
stout
base
i
thought
it
was
odd
that
a
beer
under
7
feltso
boozy
so
far
this
is
now
my
least
favorite
beer
from
anderson
valley
and
its
on
the
lower
end
of
the
scale
as
far
as
the
style
goes
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
this
beer
needs
some
work
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
pours
a
cola
color
with
cocoa
foam
i
found
it
had
a
somewhat
prominent
albeit
light
rootbeer
aroma
and
a
muddled
bourbon
and
rootbeer
aftertaste
thin
mouthfeel
for
what
it
promises
oo
rating
a
22oz
bottle
served
in
pint
glass
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
in
color
with
an
oily
slickness
to
it
and
forms
a
large
dark
brown
head
with
pillowy
foam
aroma
is
not
particularly
roasty
hoppy
or
otherwise
beery
but
is
distinctly
of
oaky
bourbon
flavor
is
like
sipping
fine
bourbon
creamy
smooth
low
alcohol
zero
burn
bourbon
as
a
stout
this
is
pretty
unremarkable
and
fulfills
the
requirement
perfunctorily
with
the
right
color
but
as
a
vehicle
for
sweet
vanilla
oak
barrel
flavor
this
is
quite
a
lot
of
fun
smell
is
super
barrely
light
bodied
chocolatey
lightly
smoky
tasty
the
verdict
awesome
its
not
in
the
league
of
firestones
sucaba
but
its
right
up
there
in
the
same
neighborhood
smooth
complex
and
delicious
very
creamy
body
medium
full
very
fine
soft
carbonation
above
average
o
at
first
not
quite
as
bourbon
dominated
as
the
aroma
and
initial
taste
suggested
easy
drinking
the
light
mouthfeel
at
first
distracts
a
bit
from
the
drinking
experience
but
the
persistent
bourbon
flavor
grows
more
enjoyable
to
the
point
you
dont
mind
iof
the
mouthfeel
is
light
pours
out
a
beautiful
black
color
with
a
tan
head
that
quickly
retreats
to
a
thin
but
lasting
lace
the
aroma
is
coffee
and
chocolate
and
the
taste
is
dominated
by
dark
chocolate
not
much
bourbon
flavor
considering
how
flavorful
wild
turkey
bourbon
is
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
low
but
sufficient
carbonation
overall
a
decent
entry
on
tap
at
brews
brothers
mild
aroma
of
chocolate
and
bourbon
nice
dark
color
has
a
slightly
carbonated
taste
similar
to
coke
can
tell
it
is
wild
turkey
really
has
that
alcohol
taste
all
right
beer
prefer
some
of
the
barrel
aged
beers
in
the
great
lakes
region
more
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
bourbonbarrel
aged
stout
but
not
a
great
one
there
are
some
good
flavors
of
malt
and
sweetness
and
some
bourbon
too
but
its
not
as
strong
as
some
other
better
bourbon
barrelaged
stouts
out
there
still
its
worth
a
drink
when
you
want
a
bourbon
barrelaged
stout
but
dont
want
to
get
a
full
buzz
or
drunk
on
i
really
like
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
strong
and
sorta
smooth
at
the
same
time
nice
aroma
and
the
aftertaste
is
bourbony
love
it
their
pumpkin
variation
is
incredibly
good
too
btw
on
tap
at
empire
slice
house
okc
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
finger
of
creamy
mocha
head
that
recedes
quickly
the
tap
is
pretty
cold
so
theres
not
a
lot
of
aroma
you
can
definitely
smell
the
bourbon
some
chocolate
and
coffee
the
bourbon
predominates
the
taste
and
is
a
bit
much
some
dark
chocolate
and
red
plums
sneak
their
way
in
really
really
boozy
medium
mouth
but
not
a
lot
of
oil
the
aftertaste
disappears
quickly
did
i
mention
its
a
bourbon
first
brew
it
really
loses
any
sense
of
balance
as
it
warms
im
not
likely
to
revisit
this
one
soon
on
draught
at
kraftwork
in
fishtown
great
initial
smell
and
taste
but
taste
subsides
just
a
bit
o
this
beer
adds
to
my
suspicion
that
low
abv
stouts
and
bourbon
dont
mix
velvet
merkin
was
better
but
not
by
a
significant
margin
basically
the
beer
itself
acts
mostly
a
conduit
for
the
bourbon
flavor
and
whatever
flavor
the
beer
does
have
doesnt
mesh
terribly
well
with
the
bourbon
gotta
give
them
credit
for
shooting
for
a
low
abv
ba
stout
at
a
reasonable
price
but
just
doesnt
get
there
edit
got
a
bit
better
at
room
temp
but
still
closer
to
mediocre
export
version
from
the
netherlands
bottle
simply
reads
bourbon
barrel
stout
without
a
mention
of
wild
turkey
contains
the
same
alcohol
content
and
a
different
background
image
of
what
looks
like
a
bear
i
believe
this
is
the
same
beer
though
bought
a
bomber
bottle
of
this
from
tanakaya
in
mejiro
tokyo
japan
poured
into
a
pint
class
awesome
chocolate
foam
and
a
thick
wonderful
mouthfeel
to
this
but
it
really
lets
me
down
as
far
as
bourbon
barrel
stouts
go
there
was
not
much
in
the
nose
to
excite
and
while
the
taste
was
pleasant
i
was
hoping
for
more
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
would
not
make
my
top
rankings
of
barrelaged
stouts
i
picked
up
a
case
for
the
restaurant
that
i
work
for
after
going
to
a
trade
show
where
avbc
was
showing
this
off
at
first
i
was
kind
of
dismissive
because
there
are
a
lot
of
these
bourbon
barrel
stouts
showing
up
and
i
just
logged
it
away
with
another
one
trick
pony
like
some
of
the
rest
so
i
visited
a
few
other
tables
and
then
found
myself
standing
back
in
front
of
this
display
so
i
gave
in
the
nose
was
all
wild
turkey
that
sweet
warm
toasty
smell
i
fully
prepared
myself
for
the
same
on
the
palate
and
was
so
delighted
to
have
this
delicious
delightfully
bitter
stout
greet
my
taste
buds
the
finish
is
long
and
that
is
where
the
wild
turkey
showed
up
again
i
am
usually
more
open
minded
to
beer
and
i
immediately
kicked
myself
for
initially
passing
this
one
over
so
i
would
say
overall
this
a
joy
of
a
brew
that
i
immediately
ordered
so
that
i
had
it
available
for
myself
whenever
i
want
it
its
a
good
beer
but
very
bland
indeed
i
have
had
trader
joes
stout
that
had
betterintense
aroma
and
flavor
than
this
beer
the
smell
is
aromatic
but
not
at
the
same
level
as
other
barrel
stouts
i
have
tried
i
will
give
this
beer
a
try
again
to
make
sure
that
this
review
i
am
posting
is
sane
and
by
no
means
i
was
biased
in
this
review
o
a
little
thin
in
body
to
be
a
heavy
hitting
ba
stout
the
carbonation
is
also
a
little
too
much
the
finish
is
also
rather
uninspring
a
great
beer
just
needs
to
be
a
little
thickerricher
flavors
are
awesome
the
bourbon
notes
really
stand
out
both
in
taste
and
smell
it
pours
beautifully
nice
color
and
wonderfully
formed
head
it
just
seems
like
it
should
be
strongerstarker
o
a
perfectly
acceptable
beer
especially
given
the
availability
and
reasonable
price
range
however
certainly
fails
when
held
to
the
high
standards
of
other
barrelaged
stouts
out
there
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
a
good
option
if
youre
at
a
bar
with
limited
choices
on
tap
nothing
id
go
far
out
of
my
way
for
however
this
beer
is
deceptive
in
many
ways
as
it
looks
like
its
going
to
be
this
bad
ass
stout
with
a
wild
turkey
kick
but
then
it
hits
you
like
a
pillow
with
soft
complex
flavors
that
come
through
a
very
light
body
and
highlight
the
bourbon
complexities
without
being
obnoxiously
in
your
face
and
overpowering
my
friend
chris
told
me
this
was
a
great
beer
and
he
suggested
that
i
try
it
and
i
must
say
that
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
it
was
much
easier
to
drink
than
i
expected
and
the
low
abv
to
me
added
to
the
overall
experience
and
made
this
a
very
solid
brew
this
is
not
the
most
complex
bourbon
barrel
aged
stout
ive
ever
had
but
its
tasty
and
drinkable
and
doesnt
fatigue
you
like
some
of
the
big
boys
do
an
above
average
stout
but
not
great
the
attempt
was
great
but
it
wasnt
quite
as
balanced
as
it
should
have
been
overall
its
a
session
bourbon
barrel
stout
for
me
good
for
when
you
need
that
kick
but
dont
want
to
fully
commit
overall
the
brew
is
not
very
complex
no
real
depth
the
only
thing
going
for
the
brew
is
that
you
could
taste
the
wild
turkey
there
are
several
other
bourbon
ales
i
would
drink
before
this
one
but
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
snifter
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
more
complex
than
the
taste
taste
is
dominated
by
black
licorice
from
begining
to
end
when
i
say
dominated
i
mean
it
i
had
trouble
pulling
any
other
tastes
from
this
brew
the
smell
however
was
really
nice
with
chocolatebrown
sugar
toffee
and
maybe
a
hint
of
mocha
the
taste
just
really
let
me
down
with
how
one
dimentional
it
was
beer
tastes
stronger
than
the
listed
alcohol
content
of
6
3
not
a
great
beer
imo
but
not
horrible
either
dont
plan
to
buy
again
do
have
a
anderson
bourbon
barrel
amber
that
i
hope
wil
be
better
o
decent
but
not
close
to
being
on
same
level
as
many
of
the
other
ba
stouts
on
the
market
these
days
for
a
bourbon
barrel
stout
this
is
on
the
lower
end
o
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
at
first
but
it
definitely
grew
on
me
particularly
the
big
bourbon
characters
in
the
taste
nothing
special
but
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
oit
is
nice
to
be
able
to
get
this
any
time
but
it
is
a
last
resort
ba
stout
the
combination
of
heat
booze
and
thin
feel
is
not
good
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
coffee
notes
are
noteworthy
there
is
a
reason
the
successful
ba
stouts
are
crafted
in
small
batches
with
careful
attention
i
get
the
impression
this
ale
is
mass
produced
with
little
attention
to
detail
o
quite
a
contrast
from
the
enjoy
by
i
had
earlier
some
might
not
like
the
upfront
bourbon
taste
or
the
sweetness
but
i
think
this
is
extremely
close
to
pulling
it
off
it
reminds
me
of
the
home
brew
my
cousin
used
to
make
with
crown
you
know
the
crown
was
there
and
it
added
positively
to
beer
a
touch
more
heft
in
the
stout
department
would
be
a
great
addition
overall
a
nice
very
tasty
beer
low
alcohol
for
the
beer
style
22
picked
up
at
cap
market
in
salem
wild
turkey
on
the
label
suggests
someone
might
be
paying
attention
to
this
one
maybe
a
bit
but
not
enough
pours
well
mild
foam
a
bit
of
decent
lacing
ring
of
foam
throughout
the
rest
of
the
glass
colors
a
nice
dark
molassescaramel
nose
is
cocoa
bit
of
raisin
a
bit
boozy
mind
you
its
only
6
9
taste
is
ok
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
not
bad
either
though
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
bit
of
cocoa
leather
but
for
6
9
it
seems
kind
of
a
bit
much
on
the
bourbon
a
bit
more
than
id
expect
id
rather
have
some
nuanced
characteristics
but
it
just
comes
across
as
basic
again
nothing
really
wrong
but
nothing
to
warrant
a
second
glass
especially
at
10
for
a
bomber
i
had
a
clown
shoes
blaecorn
unidragon
before
which
may
affect
this
review
pours
black
with
some
reddening
around
the
edges
and
a
persistent
two
fingers
of
light
brown
head
on
the
nose
i
get
woodsy
vanilla
caramel
and
chocolate
with
an
alcohol
aroma
which
is
surprising
given
that
its
only
6
9
abv
theres
a
roasted
malt
quality
as
well
all
these
flavors
are
stretched
thin
in
the
taste
here
there
is
relatively
little
malt
presence
its
bourbon
forward
with
a
dry
cocoa
powder
and
vanilla
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
and
it
finishes
with
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
o
the
bourbon
was
more
prominent
than
i
expected
given
the
low
abv
however
i
think
the
base
beer
struggled
to
match
up
with
the
other
barrel
flavors
still
very
drinkable
for
a
bba
stout
rich
and
chocolatey
starts
off
innocently
but
theres
a
strong
fudge
kick
in
the
swallow
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
an
after
dinner
chocolate
i
do
not
taste
the
whiskey
i
smelled
earlier
the
body
is
thick
and
the
carbonation
low
its
a
bit
like
drinking
a
carbonated
chilled
hot
cocoa
on
tap
at
yardhouse
i
think
a
pint
was
7
looks
like
your
typical
stout
black
head
was
decent
and
tan
in
color
aroma
was
a
nice
bourbon
thick
with
hints
of
stout
flavor
was
above
average
heavy
bourbon
with
roasted
malts
but
it
felt
too
thin
i
ordered
thus
thinking
it
was
huge
arker
and
was
a
little
disappointed
i
think
bourbon
barrels
are
great
for
beer
but
the
base
beer
needs
to
be
pretty
big
to
stand
up
to
it
lower
abv
beers
are
just
too
watery
this
offering
is
good
but
there
are
a
number
of
bourbon
barrel
stouts
out
there
that
are
definitely
superior
o
great
but
less
bourbon
than
i
was
expecting
a
super
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
aromas
of
vanilla
and
charred
oak
taste
begins
with
some
sweet
grain
then
some
oak
after
that
is
some
vanilla
a
hint
of
earthy
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouth
feel
is
a
little
light
but
not
too
bad
overall
quite
good
not
as
rich
as
some
bourbon
barrel
stouts
but
not
as
high
alcohol
either
i
will
definitely
get
it
again
pours
and
off
very
very
deep
opaquer
brown
with
creamy
tan
head
that
held
well
thin
collar
aroma
is
some
dark
chocolate
vanilla
and
caramel
sweetness
taste
is
much
the
same
with
no
noticeable
bourbon
or
oak
presence
until
the
very
end
creamy
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
and
a
body
just
on
the
thin
side
of
thick
this
is
my
third
anderson
valley
review
had
this
on
tap
at
the
village
anchor
outstanding
almost
definitely
the
best
beer
of
this
kind
that
ive
had
heavy
smoke
brown
sugar
and
of
course
bourbon
flavor
incredible
bourbon
and
coffee
aroma
if
you
like
bourbon
ales
i
cant
think
if
anything
better
on
a
chilly
night
only
drawback
is
the
price
usually
i
dont
invest
this
much
for
a
beer
but
this
time
it
mightve
been
worth
it
bottle
aroma
is
strange
to
me
for
the
style
lots
of
vanilla
caramel
toffee
on
the
nose
poured
jet
black
with
an
inch
thick
light
tan
head
that
dissipated
quickly
taste
is
exactly
like
the
nose
vanilla
caramel
toffee
didnt
get
much
roasted
malt
and
seemed
a
little
light
for
a
stout
finish
just
drops
out
decent
but
not
my
favorite
the
barrel
treatment
is
obvious
but
there
is
no
there
there
meaning
there
is
no
depth
here
just
kind
of
falls
flat
is
it
bad
no
not
by
any
means
and
in
fact
this
might
be
great
with
certain
food
pairings
but
overall
it
seems
lacking
overall
a
really
good
beer
that
proves
you
dont
have
to
turn
the
glass
of
beer
into
a
12
hot
bourbon
drink
it
maintains
its
beer
character
very
well
alongside
the
bourbon
one
of
the
better
blends
ive
seen
under
8
a
very
welldone
stout
with
the
creamy
dark
grain
and
malt
sweetness
character
shining
throughout
wellbalanced
and
nicely
complex
while
keeping
a
respectably
low
abv
not
necessarily
a
session
brew
but
could
just
about
make
the
cut
most
of
the
whiskey
barrel
notes
come
through
in
the
aroma
while
letting
the
malt
flavors
do
the
talking
in
the
overall
taste
very
satisfying
overall
this
beer
is
amazing
drinks
so
easy
while
packing
a
huge
amount
of
taste
bourbon
and
chocolate
roasted
into
a
delicious
stout
the
finish
has
a
dry
taste
of
bourbon
and
chocolate
making
you
want
more
and
more
of
this
wonderful
stout
this
is
by
and
far
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
had
overall
my
1st
anderson
valley
beer
and
i
am
not
overly
impressed
this
is
a
lite
stout
and
is
lacking
in
body
and
oomph
feels
thin
but
refreshing
not
deep
in
rich
flavors
as
i
prefer
my
porters
but
perhaps
appealing
to
someone
who
likes
a
lighter
style
a
little
thin
overall
flavors
on
the
tongue
but
not
substantial
it
is
close
to
being
great
would
love
to
see
this
on
cask
somewhere
overall
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
for
it
but
i
feel
like
it
just
lacks
the
body
to
be
great
everything
starts
out
good
but
kind
of
craps
out
midway
through
i
would
get
this
again
though
just
seems
a
bit
faint
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
well
balanced
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
on
the
palate
to
carry
the
beer
forward
gets
better
with
warmth
and
time
but
never
really
reaches
that
high
there
are
just
too
many
good
bourbon
stouts
out
there
i
suppose
o
first
impression
is
this
is
more
like
a
mildly
barrel
aged
porter
enjoyable
but
doesnt
knock
it
out
of
the
park
its
got
some
nice
flavors
for
a
7
brew
but
i
think
id
rather
have
their
oatmeal
stout
of
interest
my
wife
liked
this
more
than
me
particularly
because
it
was
lighter
flavored
and
had
a
lower
abv
while
i
was
looking
for
more
she
liked
the
simpler
lighter
bourbon
stout
flavors
on
display
with
this
brew
taste
boom
boom
there
it
is
thickness
and
richness
of
the
bourbon
barrels
all
over
the
palate
plump
and
full
and
ending
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
and
theres
the
cherry
theres
the
vanilla
theres
the
roast
and
the
toast
mmmm
not
quite
so
full
bodied
pretty
much
mediumish
lots
of
tastiness
easydrinking
not
too
strong
this
one
lot
of
bourbon
barrel
beers
are
imperial
stouts
this
one
is
regular
stout
and
its
awfully
nice
o
interesting
take
on
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
stout
id
say
go
boozier
on
the
abv
and
you
got
yourself
a
nicely
balanced
imperial
as
it
amazing
bourbon
flavor
seems
slightly
too
subtle
the
smell
is
actually
deceiving
for
what
you
get
for
taste
unusually
thin
with
perhaps
slightly
too
much
bitterness
in
the
finish
for
its
lack
of
more
intense
flavors
nothing
in
particular
stands
out
to
make
you
say
wow
im
relatively
new
to
this
type
of
beer
but
perhaps
have
been
spoiled
by
higher
rated
ones
its
a
beer
id
recommend
trying
for
the
sake
of
trying
it
after
all
its
subjective
but
nothing
to
rave
about
not
a
bourbon
stout
that
improves
as
it
warms
i
felt
as
though
i
needed
to
drink
the
full
glass
before
it
warmed
vs
other
beers
in
this
category
which
improved
as
they
warmed
and
breathed
and
literally
lasted
12
hrs
for
12
oz
other
bourbon
stouts
seem
to
encourage
continual
tastes
to
decipher
the
full
complexity
of
the
beer
whereas
this
seems
like
a
stout
one
would
drink
for
the
sake
of
drinking
a
stout
while
attention
is
aimed
elsewhere
not
bad
but
not
great
overall
a
great
beer
for
people
just
getting
into
the
ba
beer
style
easy
to
drink
not
to
expensive
and
pretty
easy
find
and
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
ba
beers
overall
i
hope
this
beer
bottles
and
lasts
as
well
as
it
tastes
fresh
ontap
because
if
it
does
this
will
be
added
to
my
alwayskeeponhand
selection
prost
lampertland
i
enjoyed
this
beer
alot
and
wish
i
could
drink
this
all
day
cause
its
sessionable
at
7
but
for
something
to
get
at
10
bucks
a
pop
well
i
was
expecting
more
very
nice
though
near
jet
black
1
5
fingers

is
roasted
with

some
bourbon
and

mild

as
well
a
bit
of

and
lightly

but
not
unpleasant
taste
is
lightly
roasted
chocolate
and
vanilla
oak
is
light
with
a
bit
of
bourbon
mid

vanillaoaky
finish
medium
carbonation
fairly
thin

as
well
not
bad
in
terms
of
flavour
but
the
thin
points
of
this
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
though
its
somewhat
of
a
mess
and
i
cant
understand
why
theyd
attempt
this
with
such
a
light
and
carbonated
base
beer
overall
its
easy
to
drink
not
overwhelming
yet
welldefined
in
its
aroma
and
taste
really
smooth
but
not
amazing
on
terms
of
depth
or
complexity
good
drink
ability
but
would
seek
out
others
in
the
future
3
75
and
it
tastes
like
bourbon
this
beer
is
a
little
on
the
mild
side
at
6
9
meaning
that
it
just
gets
bulldozed
by
the
barrelaging
now
if
youre
a
barrelaged
nut
who
is
all
about
their
beer
tasting
like
bourbon
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
look
to
barrelaging
to
add
complexity
to
already
intense
ales
look
elsewhere
as
this
is
a
mild
stout
bourbonized
poured
from
bottle
into
chalice
deep
black
color
with
really
nice
airy
foamy
tan
head
lots
of
roasted
malt
aromas
and
hints
of
chocolate
similar
flavor
roasted
malt
and
a
lot
of
chocolate
flavor
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
only
a
slight
note
of
bourbon
but
that
may
be
the
vanilla
i
taste
i
think
the
best
quality
of
this
brew
is
how
smooth
it
is
its
silky
creamy
and
so
easy
to
drink
really
a
nice
stout
although
walking
the
line
of
imperial
its
nice
to
get
such
a
good
quality
semilow
abv
american
stout
well
worth
a
try
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
but
i
was
expecting
some
bite
upon
further
review
its
only
6
9
which
is
its
oly
drawback
o
solid
example
nice
notes
and
flavors
this
price
overall
its
the
best
beer
on
tap
in
singapore
and
i
am
glad
to
have
had
a
glass
before
the
barrel
kicks
im
sure
the
bottle
is
just
as
nice
but
nothing
beats
a
tap
lighter
body
characteristics
solid
stout
flavor
and
minor
bourbon
hints
make
it
extremely
sessionable
stout
i
should
have
gone
back
today
for
another
recommended
o
overall
really
liked
the
wild
turkey
burbon
barrel
influence
here
a
burbon
i
am
highly
familar
with
from
my
youth
straight
from
the
bottle
smooth
spiciness
sweet
caramel
cream
thought
the
stout
portion
comes
off
a
bit
light
bodied
and
seems
a
bit
underweight
per
class
like
a
feather
weight
boxer
to
a
heavy
weight
this
is
not
going
to
be
your
typical
huge
ba
stout
to
the
likes
of
dark
lord
black
hole
insert
any
other
ba
stout
to
your
liking
here
rather
this
seems
like
an
easy
and
sweet
milk
stout
with
gentle
burbon
highlights
perfect
for
that
causual
drinking
in
multiples
despite
its
6
9abv
which
seems
perfect
here
i
really
enjoyed
the
gentle
and
sweet
drinking
nature
it
had
to
offer
showing
not
every
ba
stout
has
to
be
a
malt
monster
and
soaked
with
alcohol
this
does
nicely
as
a
causual
drinker
and
something
i
would
consider
multiples
in
with
good
company
salud
incredibly
easy
to
drink
o
glad
i
tried
this
as
im
a
big
fan
of
their
oatmeal
stout
a
little
too
much
fresh
barrel
has
tee
for
be
but
probably
what
they
were
going
for
so
still
worth
a
try
absolutely
o
its
a
nice
beer
but
theres
nothing
really
great
about
it
overall
i
guess
for
the
relatively
low
abv
this
is
alright
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
however
its
pretty
uneventful
and
underwhelming
anderson
valley
has
never
really
impressed
though
so
i
guess
thats
not
too
much
of
a
surprise
not
offputting
just
nothing
worth
remembering
thanks
again
doodler

to
see
it

in

would
definitely
recommend
the
body
thins
out
a
little

much
and
it
carries
from
beginning
to

its
somewhat
lacking
the
boldness
and
robustness

the

americans
especially
are
famous
for
its
semidry

playing
off
sweeter
aspects
d
over

pleasant
enough
i
wont
go
seek
it
again
but
if
it
happened
to
be
around
i
would
drink
it
again
i
really
like
the
taste
of
this
beer
and
its
aroma
it

too
thin
for
me
and
it
just
isnt

good

to
my
satisfaction
the

the

allowed
some

to
shine

superb

to
it

15
stouts
i
am
actually
a
big
fan
of
when
the
bourbon
shows
big
in
stouts
but
the
subtleties
of
this
one
are
fantastic
easily
one
of
the
better
american
stouts
i
have
had
over
the
years
lighter
than
most
in
this
category
i
get
some
sweet
first
and
some
bitter
at
the
finish
in
the
middle
i
get
a
lighter
variation
of
the
roasted
malts
maybe
some
burnt
chocolate
vanilla
very
smooth
the
more
i
taste
this
the
more
i
like
it
perhaps
the
lighterthanmost
abv
allows
the
smootherthanmost
taste
from
this
one
i
have
found
most
anderson
valley
brews
to
be
very
much
above
average
and
this
one
is
a
tad
better
than
that
not
world
class
but
excellent
the
body
was
much
thinner
than
i
expect
in
the
style
this
felt
more
like
a
light
porter
drinkability
was
excellent
my
glass
disappeared
quickly
and
i
think
therell
be
another
in
my
future
overall
a
pretty
nice
brew
maybe
not
one
that
will
please
the
moar
extreme
now
crowd
but
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
brew
worth
trying
o
im
not
sure
the
price
of
this
but
i
would
benchmark
it
against
dragons
milk
if
it
is
around
6
a
bomber
then
it
is
worth
picking
up
i
wouldnt
spend
much
more
on
it
thank
you
ken
for
the
bottle
the
barrel
is
really
dominant
here
as
the
base
beer
is
somewhat
dazed
lost
amist
the
turkey
interesting
to
taste
so
much
of
the
barrel
though
pretty
good
beer
not
the
extreme
complexity
of
some
of
the
big
bb
monsters
that
we
all
know
and
love
but
plenty
going
on
in
something
a
lighter
lighter
worth
trying
for
sure
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
its
good
tasting
easy
to
drink
and
mostly
matches
the
description
it
doesnt
have
to
be
assertive
to
be
good
its
just
a
great
beer
even
if
you
dont
have
the
ibus
abv
and
the
heaviness
to
brag
about
im
not
here
to
brag
im
here
to
drink
a
good
beer
and
this
really
is
a

finished
wanting

is

with

and
very

i
was
looking
for
more

in
the
taste
but
otherwise
a
nicely
enjoyable
stout
excellent
brew
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
thick
foamy
tan
head
that
settled
after

cocoa
whiskey
vanilla
caramel
hint
of

flavors
like
nose
starts
more
like
stout
with
a
hint
of
whiskey
then
the
whiskey
really
comes
out
strong
to
a
point
thats
perhaps
a
tad
too
much
carbonic
tang
is
up
front
followed
immediately
with
malt
sweet
then
some
bitter
at
the
end
bodycarbonation
are
very
good
tho
the
whiskey
throws
the
balance
a
smidgen
finish
is
like
flavor
the
whiskey
makes
it
long
probably
only
have
this
one
bomber
be
a
good
one
to
share
o
nice
lots
of
flavor
and
fairly
smooth
didnt
pick
up
much
bourbon
here
and
heavy
on
the
vanilla
notes
but
still
quite
tasty
overall
i
really
dig
and
am
very
happy
to
see
anderson
flats
in
maryland
if
this
is
what
theyre
selling
taste
is
similar
with
elements
of
caramelised
ginger
bread
hints
of
wood
and
vanilla
some
dry
dark
toast
in
the
finish
overall
leaning
slightly
to
sweet
side
with
gentle
nice
warming
element
a
mild
whiskeyish
hint
very
mild
bitterness
to
help
balance
out
its
not
super
sweet
though
and
is
not
very
oily
or
heavy
in
body
and
feel
oa
tasty
beverage
was
waiting
a
long
time
to
try
this
one
pours
jet
black
there
is
definetly
some
nice
bourbon
oakey
notes
in
the
nose
not
very
over
bearing
though
overall
taste
is
what
i
excpeted
an
amped
up
version
of
anderson
valleys
already
awesome
oatmeal
stout
a
fair
ammount
of
vanilla
along
with
a
nice
oakey
smoke
flavors
its
a
really
chewey
chunky
oatmeal
mouth
texture
to
it
which
i
really
enjoy
great
to
have
a
ba
stout
that
wont
beat
you
over
the
head
with
the
abv
or
break
the
bank
overall
nothing
remarkable
but
its
very
good
nonetheless
you
wont
be
disappointed
in
this
one
but
you
probably
wont
actively
seek
it
out
in
again
either
if
you
think
of
this
as
a
single
stout
that
has
been
barrelaged
i
would
say
that
the
underlying
beer
is
a
little
weak
still
the
barrel
aging
really
helps
it
become
more
interesting
i
would
never
be
able
to
pick
out
that
it
was
specifically
wild
turkey
though
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
really
all
that
good
id
say
its
a
just
above
average
stout
but
with
so
many
great
bourbon
barreled
beers
out
there
this
seems
shitty
in
comparison
wouldnt
recommend
disappointing
for
the
price
subpar
taste
like
a
watered
down
stout
with
a
splash
of
cheap
bourbon
hastily
poured
in
mouthfeel
relatively
thin
for
a
ba
stout
ov
a
solid
very
drinkable
stout
with
good
flavours
if
you
like
bourbon
flavour
in
your
stout
then
this
wont
disappoint
you
just
know
going
it
that
its
not
a
chewy
ris
style
definitely
worth
trying
and
i
would
drink
it
again
anderson
valley
is
a
good
name
in
beer
but
this
is
a
miss
disappointing
as
bourbon
barrel
aged
stouts
go
and
generally
as
craft
beer
goes
its
meh
its
almost
ok
but
its
not
at
all
memorable
its
mild
and
round
and
has
no
real
distinguishing
character
except
for
a
bit
of
wood
taste
which
isnt
particularly
good
it
is
lacking
in
substance
and
almost
tastes
diluted
almost
has
a
touch
of
that
taste
from
the
bottom
of
a
glass
of
cola
with
ice
when
the
cola
has
been
watered
down
by
all
of
the
melted
ice
and
its
a
diet
cola
at
that
and
i
think
thats
actually
the
bourbon
taste
trying
to
come
through
which
doesnt
speak
well
for
the
bourbon
it
has
kind
of
a
cheap
taste
yet
costs
plenty
smells
decent
with
a
nice
chocolate
frosting
note
smooth
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
they
were
going
for
with
this
beer
would
not
by
again
would
not
recommend
needs
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
o
overall
definitely
a
quite
drinkable
beer
this
certainly
wont
take
you
out
quickly
like
most
others
as
others
have
noted
this
is
more
sessionable
than
other
bourbon
barrel
stouts
pretty
tasty
though
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
bourbon
goodness
theres
a
good
beer
here
but
two
things
fail
it
one
a
lack
of
body
and
two
a
lack
of
real
barrel
character
close
but
no
cigar
i
am
not
a
stout
drinker
at
all
but
the
thought
of
chocolate
in
a
bourbon
barrel
was
intriguing
and
what
a
bad
thing
it
would
have
been
if
i
hadnt
tried
this
delicious
brew
i
keep
hoping
someone
else
will
have
it
on
tap
when
it
is
i
am
gonna
buy
a
couple
of
growlers
and
believe
me
they
wont
last

overall
a
really
drinkable
bourbon
stout
most
bourbon
stouts
are
very
high
abv
and
you
can
only
have
1
or
2
this
is
quite
sessionable
at
6
9
however
if
you
may
want
to
begin
your
session
with
dessert
since
this
beer
definitely
has
a
sweetness
to
it
3
25
d
its
worth
a
try
i
guess
but
its
not
something
worth
revisiting
interesting
brew
has
some
attractive
characteristics
though
something
a
bit
off
for
me
in
the
flavor
department
maybe
has
something
to
do
with
the
malt
beverage
versus
beer
identifier
on
the
label
no
hops
i
love
anderson
valleys
canned
oatmeal
stout
so
when
i
saw
they
did
a
barrel
aged
stout
i
was
sold
pours
pitch
black
into
my
chalice
with
at
least
four
fingers
of
tan
head
even
spread
lacing
i
like
how
they
kept
the
abv
pretty
modest
compared
to
some
of
the
other
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
the
nose
is
beautiful
a
kiss
of
bourbon
amongst
a
nice
creamy
dark
chocolate
back
drop
hints
of
vanilla
and
charred
oak
complement
the
dark
roasted
barley
in
the
stout
flavor
develops
nicely
with
each
sip
expressing
more
wild
turkey
bourbon
characteristics
especially
the
smooth
boozy
vanilla
and
charred
oak
expressions
tucked
into
a
glorious
dark
roasted
malt
and
mild
herbal
hopped
stout
flavors
im
getting
are
dark
chocolate
bitter
and
dry
with
a
creamy
vanilla
center
its
man
candy
in
the
realm
of
barrel
aged
stouts
mouthfeel
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
but
the
warmth
of
the
whiskey
comes
through
a
medium
bodied
stout
mild
carbonation
albeit
natural
feeling
and
smooth
going
down
alcohol
burns
the
palate
minimally
at
6
9
its
a
22
ounce
bottle
that
your
liver
doesnt
mind
finishing
on
its
own
overall
an
impressive
complex
and
approachable
barrel
aged
stout
i
would
drink
this
again
and
i
know
its
not
too
over
the
top
to
introduce
bud
drinking
friends
who
enjoy
whiskey
this
could
convert
your
friends
into
craft
beer
and
i
can
tell
its
going
to
pair
great
with
my
aj
fernandez
blended
san
lotano
habano
toro
cigar
im
about
to
toast
up
pairing
with
the
san
lotano
the
spicy
nicaraugan
tobacco
goes
great
with
this
flavorful
stout
actually
bringing
out
more
whiskey
flavors
leather
and
oak
from
the
well
aged
tobacco
also
complement
the
flavor
profile
of
this
stout
if
you
try
this
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pair
it
with
a
hand
rolled
cigar
d
this
was
a
solid
bourbon
stout
the
scent
and
taste
were
well
composed
and
balanced
the
body
was
weak
but
the
finish
was
very
smooth
so
it
was
really
easy
to
drink
probably
not
for
aging
but
it
was
great
fresh
its
drinkable
for
sure
with
the
low
abv
smells
real
good
somewhat
weak
in
the
taste
but
overall
its
pretty
good
not
sure
its
worth
the
10
price
tag
though
maybe
agin
another
bottle
will
prove
successful
overall
solid
really
packs
a
punch
of
flavor
and
can
really
taste
the
beam
in
it
if
you
like
jim
beam
then
this
is
a
beer
for
you
its
really
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
gives
you
a
big
beer
feeling
wrapped
into
a
6
9er
worth
a
drink
for
sure
its
not
on
par
with
kbs
but
it
is
well
worth
a
try

of
bourbon
here
i
really
like
this
beer
dispute
the
flaws
and
it
is
flawed
it
runs
around
9
bucks
for
a
bomber
which
in
the
bourbon
barrel
world
is
great
but
for
such
a
thin
beer
it
feels
like
it
is
a
touch
high
this
all
said
no
review
to
put
out
but
seek
this
one
out
in
tap
over
the
bottles
do
this
beer
represents
the
relatively
uncommon
practice
of
barrelaging
a
normal
gravity
porterstyle
ale
not
surprisingly
it
is
reminiscent
of
barrelaged
black
marlin
porter
by
ballast
point
yet
falls
short
of
that
other
beer
due
to
a
less
wellestablished
malt
base
it
does
yield
many
transformative
qualities
indicative
of
the
spirit
and
the
wood
but
its
runaway
acidity
also
leaves
the
palate
feeling
nearly
scorched
o
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
such
a
relatively
weak
bba
stout
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
certainly
not
as
flavorrich
as
the
heavier
stouts
in
the
category
but
overall
it
was
a
pleasant
beer
that
was
very
drinkable
like
a
bba
stout
lite
i
had
it
from
a
22oz
bomber
and
felt
like
i
could
finish
the
whole
thing
i
wish
the
bourbon
was
a
bit
more
prominent
perhaps
to
cover
the
aftertaste
id
buy
it
again
since
it
has
some
complexity
but
not
as
alcoholic
as
the
highgravity
beers
overall
it
really
is
tasty
and
well
made
not
your
traditional
bourbon
stout
considering
its
abv
reviews
for
this
beer
are
kinda
silly
just
because
its
not
super
thick
and
strong
doesnt
mean
this
isnt
a
great
bourbon
barrel
stout
the
taste
has
an
extremely
well
integrated
bourbon
flavor
which
wonderfully
mingles
with
the
base
stout
strong
vanilla
and
oak
tones
extremely
tasty
very
drinkable
overall
tasty
brew
really
like
what
the
barrel
did
to
this
one
subtlety
works
in
this
genre
let
the
barrel
shine
i
must
admit
i
really
enjoy
wild
turkey
so
this
beer
delivered
a
great
2
in
1
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
an
inch
frothy
tan
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
bourbon
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
it
tastes
like
roastedcharred
malt
bittersweet
and
milk
chocolate
coffee
vanilla
and
bourbon
the
bourbon
character
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
is
light
but
still
noticeable
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
thin
for
a
stout
it
has
moderate
carbonation
and
goes
down
easy
enough
im
a
little
disappointed
that
the
bourbon
in
this
brew
isnt
stronger
but
its
still
a
decent
beer
overall
with
that
being
said
i
wouldnt
pay
11
99
a
bottle
for
this
again
when
the
label
says
bourbon
barrel
stout
i
am
looking
for
some
serious
flavors
but
this
did
not
deliver
in
that
regard
closer
to
a
brown
ale
than
a
stout
imo
and
had
no
bourbon
to
be
found
anywhere
still
this
could
make
an
excellent
desert
beer
or
a
beer
for
a
lighter
palate
who
doesnt
like
a
lot
of
roast
or
bourbon
in
their
beer
o
even
for
a
7
abv
bourbon
barrel
stout
i
expected
this
one
to
be
more
pronounced
and
full
in
smell
taste
and
feel
a
bit
disappointing
a
rather
boring
barrel
aged
brew
but
it
drinks
nice
and
has
a
nice
flavor
o
this
was
one
of
the
more
boring
beers
i
have
had
in
the
last
couple
of
years
one
of
avs
poorer
beers
i
think
this
is
an
attempt
to
lighten
up
a
beer
that
i
dont
think
really
can
be
light
it
needs
the
big
imperial
stout
dark
maltiness
to
work
with
the
whiskey
character
without
it
they
both
feel
off
i
would
definitely
skip
this
one
especially
at
the
unbelievable
price
point
o
guess
i
expected
more
than
what
i
got
a
little
too
thin
feeling
and
not
a
very
strongly
flavored
beer
felt
closer
to
a
porter
than
a
stout
and
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
dried
it
out
a
bit
too
much
for
my
tastes
o
definitely
the
lowest
abv
if
seen
on
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
brew
is
it
the
most
flavorful
smack
in
the
face
no
not
at
all
but
its
still
got
great
balanced
flavor
an
incredibly
smooth
drinkability
and
a
hint
of
that
bourbony
deliciousness
we
all
know
and
love
much
lighter
than
most
bourbon
barrel
stouts
this
makes
an
easy
drinker
however
at
13
a
bottle
the
quality
is
surely
questionable
o
good
flavors
and
a
decent
balance
not
a
lot
of
barrel
character
but
it
allows
the
other
flavors
to
shine
a
bit
more
its
more
of
a
supporting
role
than
dominant
flavor
inoffensive
and
quite
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
not
my
personal
favorite
but
complex
fans
of
bourbon
barrel
aged
stouts
should
give
this
a
try
pours
black
with
a
big
creamy
fluffy
light
mocha
head
aroma
is
dark
fruits
and
booze
maybe
a
bit
of
chocolate
bit
of
vomit
smell
blegh
thin
mouthfeel
sweet
malta
and
candy
feuits
mixed
with
alcohol
flavor
these
nonimperial
stouts
and
porters
with
the
bourbon
just
dont
do
it
for
me
thin
alcoholic
and
no
complexity
just
tastes
like
booze
but
without
much
booze
meh
pours
midnight
black
with
a
generous
finger
of
foam
retention
could
be
better
good
lacing
though
no
visibility
or
carbonation
smells
of
bourbon
oak
coffee
chocolate
cherry
some
vanilla
rigid
malts
and
some
alcohol
not
the
most
complex
but
some
definite
activity
going
on
here
taste
comes
up
pretty
short
though
the
bourbon
is
a
bit
perpendicular
to
the
rest
of
the
taste
which
comes
and
goes
pretty
quick
a
flash
of
flavor
coffee
chocolate
oak
bourbon
is
quickly
ended
by
the
after
taste
of
malt
bourbon
and
oak
feel
is
the
lowest
part
its
strange
how
this
washes
over
the
palate
flavor
changes
quickly
but
isnt
enjoyable
not
the
most
drinkable
overall
this
would
be
a
lot
better
executed
with
an
imperial
stout
the
stout
simply
isnt
strong
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
bourbon
and
the
beer
is
for
naught
another
one
shared
by
a
friend
last
night
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
the
nose
is
pretty
weak
as
im
not
getting
much
bourbon
at
all
slightly
sweet
aroma
of
vanilla
but
this
is
really
underwhelming
decent
feel
creamy
and
smooth
velvety
texture
the
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
as
well
im
getting
little
bourbon
and
vanilla
notes
mild
oak
dryness
some
chocolate
malt
present
this
beer
is
just
sort
of
blah
not
much
going
on
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
a
bottle
thanks
anyways
for
the
pour
jacob
overall
i
was
impressed
with
the
oakiness
of
this
beer
at
first
but
unfortunately
the
taste
did
not
carry
all
the
way
through
this
beer
it
was
still
strong
enough
but
i
wish
the
flavor
was
a
bit
stronger
still
i
would
get
this
one
again
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
not
quite
what
i
would
call
good
but
certainly
one
of
the
better
brews
from
anderdon
valley
o
would
be
much
better
if
thicker
but
still
definitely
enjoyable
nope
this
doesnt
work
for
me
in
fact
this
beer
probably
explains
why
my
experience
with
bourbon
barrel
stouts
has
to
date
been
only
imperial
versions
the
bourbon
doesnt
do
anything
for
this
beer
and
in
fact
probably
harms
it
it
takes
over
the
stout
without
providing
much
good
characters
itself
the
flavours
are
assertive
but
they
just
dont
work
for
me
overall
its
not
bad
but
nothing
great
good
to
try
once
but
not
much
more
and
it
wont
age
at
all
the
buttery
vanilla
oak
is
nice
but
lack
of
bourbon
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
and
lack
of
overall
malt
profile
as
it
disappears
to
the
barrel
also
leaves
something
to
be
desired
oh
and
also
lack
of
carbonation

overall
its
a
good
bourbon
barrelaged
beer
for
the
bourbon
barrelaged
beer
lover
in
us
all
overallthis
is
the
beer
i
dreamed
on
anerderson
valley
got
this
one
right
i
have
a
ton
of
this
stuff
in
the
frig
and
will
age
it
and
see
what
happens
while
enjoying
some
now
as
well
almost
a
perfect
beer
here
if
you
like
stouts
and
wild
turkey
you
will
love
this
beer
no
where
near
worth
the
12
i
paid
for
it
here
in
nc
not
quite
as
nice
as
their
regular
oatmeal
stout
either
if
wild
turkey
was
indeed
the
barrel
for
this
particular
aging
project
that
would
go
a
long
way
in
explaining
the
big
upfront
bourbon
essence
followed
by
the
dropoff
which
here
at
least
is
picked
up
by
the
heady
malt
of
the
base
stout
sans
beer
that
effect
is
typically
unpleasant
as
a
hungry
croc
as
wild
turkey
is
rather
unappealing
on
its
own
nice
to
see
it
actually
used
for
good
av
has
done
some
excellent
work
with
this
beer
i
previously
tried
and
liked
the
tap
version
and
i
think
this
bottle
is
even
better
im
very
impressed
that
theyve
managed
to
get
such
complexity
richness
and
delicacy
into
a
beer
of
this
strength
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
their
barrel
program
and
its
exciting
to
see
av
and
fal
allen
put
something
fun
and
new
in
bottles
overall
tasty
but
not
sure
this
succeeded
thea
bourbon
barrel
treatment
didnt
yield
much
beyond
a
non
ba
stout
o
its
hard
to
make
a
bourbon
barrel
beer
work
in
a
smaller
beer
and
while
this
beer
has
its
moments
its
just
ok
in
the
end
the
bomber
price
at
9
79
is
crazy
low
b
interesting
but
lacking
depth
thin
and
lackluster
seems
like
they
barreled
a
beer
that
wasnt
quite
up
to
the
task
there
are
plenty
of
other
far
better
barrel
aged
stouts
available
for
the
money
bottled
version
different
from
the
keg
version
at
least
as
far
as
abv
is
concerned
pours
a
beautiful
dark
black
color
with
a
mediumlarge
frothy
tan
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
a
goodlookin
beer
scent
is
lacking
a
bit
a
little
on
the
light
side
mellow
bourbon
flavors
with
sweet
chocolate
and
hints
of
vanilla
some
nuttiness
and
dark
malt
aromas
hoping
the
flavors
are
a
bit
more
aggressive
they
sure
are
i
mean
as
aggressive
as
a
6
9
bourbon
barrel
aged
stout
can
be
lovely
barrel
flavors
definitely
pick
up
the
bourbon
still
has
the
characteristics
of
an
easydrinking
sessionable
stout
but
with
much
more
complexity
due
to
barrel
aging
nice
coffee
flavors
with
a
bit
of
toffee
and
vanilla
somewhat
dry
malty
finish
tasty
and
enjoyable
from
first
sip
to
the
last
mouthfeel
is
lacking
a
bit
could
be
more
heavy
as
this
one
is
light
and
creamy
almost
like
guinness
on
nitro
but
less
watery
drinkability
is
high
this
beer
and
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
nut
brown
ale
i
had
from
alesmith
are
part
of
the
beginning
of
a
new
craze
in
craft
beer
i
really
enjoy
these
low
abv
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
because
you
get
to
enjoy
a
good
amount
of
it
without
becoming
completely
intoxicated
yet
you
obtain
those
tasty
bourbon
vanilla
and
oak
notes
winwin
solid
beer
havent
had
the
lower
abv
draft
version
but
this
one
is
quite
enjoyable
the
taste
is
even
stronger
coconut
with
hints
of
vanilla
the
graham
crackery
end
lends
to
a
breadiness
or
maltiness
very
low
in
abv
it
is
my
fear
that
the
lack
of
malts
lends
to
a
watery
taste
and
feel
near
the
end
of
the
swallow
overall
this
is
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
another
fine
entry
from
a
valley
d
very
nice
overall
abv
not
heavy
helps
make
it
almost
sessionable
worth
seeking
it
out
o
this
beer
feels
much
bigger
than
it
actually
is
and
makes
you
want
to
sip
it
very
slowly
having
only
a
small
serving
impressive
to
have
the
depth
of
flavor
and
bourbonness
without
huge
abv
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
is
a
darkbrown
coloring
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
tall
dense
foamy
light
tan
head
the
nose
is
layered
with
grainy
sweet
aromas
highlighted
by
a
boozey
spicy
bourbon
scent
flavors
of
vanilla
and
spice
with
an
oaky
overtone
and
a
slow
build
of
bourbon
characteristics
there
is
a
roasty
and
coffee
backbone
throughout
rye
and
boozey
aftertaste
with
a
low
profile
that
keeps
the
drinkability
up
smooth
toasty
finish
very
strong
brew
with
building
characteristics
as
a
fan
of
bourbon
and
beer
i
am
digging
on
this
brew
overall
uneven
but
pleasant
and
certainly
not
bad
for
a
regular
stout
in
barrels
drinks
easy
my
first
of
this
kind
and
also
my
first
barrelaged
brew
from
anderson
valley
would
try
again
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
it
seems
that
the
barrels
imparted
a
far
bigger
flavor
than
the
base
beer
if
i
had
to
rate
each
flavor
separately
id
give
the
wild
turkey
an
a
and
the
base
stout
a
b
the
base
beer
just
needs
a
bolder
flavor
to
stand
up
to
the
barrel
aging
overall
though
this
is
definitely
a
good
stout
and
one
that
is
well
worth
trying
overallthis
is
nothing
more
than
a
bourbon
beer
i
can
hardly
tast
the
base
beer
in
this
the
barrel
characters
just
devour
the
oatmeal
stout
if
your
not
into
bourbon
this
is
not
the
beer
for
you
that
being
said
im
into
bourbon
and
this
beer
is
killer
very
drinkable
and
at
a
smaller
abv
than
most
barrel
aged
beers
its
totally
sessionable
its
not
as
complex
as
most
other
barrel
beers
but
what
it
lacks
in
complexity
it
makes
up
with
drinkability
4
5
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
was
the
nice
bourbon
flavoring
and
rich
woodiness
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
nose
the
nice
thing
about
this
was
that
they
came
with
sole
flavoring
without
any
overpowering
burn
and
excessive
depth
of
musky
agedness
each
component
was
strong
with
a
certain
cleanliness
to
delineate
each
from
the
next
the
lower
abv
also
contributes
to
this
guy
being
a
considerably
sessionable
stout
at
times
however
the
sweetness
does
get
up
there
and
make
this
beer
seem
a
bit
young
but
regardless
this
is
a
refreshing
offering
from
anderson
valley
the
taste
is
great
with
the
aforementioned
raisiny
yeast
fruitiness
and
slight
cocoa
blending
with
the
bourbons
sweet
and
woody
elements
that
have
a
mild
dark
malt
synergy
and
subtle
toasted
taste
overall
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
it
was
enjoyable
and
i
am
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
i
would
order
it
again
because
the
original
oatmeal
stout
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
the
barrel
definitely
is
an
improvement
adding
to
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
profile
in
my
opinion
the
way
i
hear
it
this
is
the
only
brewery
allowed
to
age
in
wild
turkey
barrels
im
not
sure
if
this
is
entirely
true
but
it
makes
for
a
good
story
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
straight
obsidian
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
whiskey
toasted
oak
and
dark
chocolate
its
pretty
simplistic
but
pleasant
nonetheless
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
now
the
oak
character
is
lessened
the
whiskey
is
consequently
increased
slightly
and
it
certainly
tastes
like
turkey
at
this
point
and
there
is
an
addition
of
very
light
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
guinnessstyle
sourness
near
the
finish
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
fluid
feel
overall
though
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
and
a
touch
too
heavy
with
the
whiskey
at
times
this
is
a
pretty
solid
barrelaged
stout
definitely
worth
a
shot
drink
i
wanted
to
love
this
sadly
i
didnt
nothing
but
mess
and
lack
of
balance
behind
it
no
vanilla
no
oak
and
no
balance
sadly
i
wont
come
back
to
this
one
overall
not
bad
but
not
really
my
bag
too
much
whiskey
character
and
not
enough
stout
in
the
end
it
just
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
beer
id
want
to
try
again
o
i
always
enjoy
bourbon
barrelaged
beers
this
one
is
certainly
solid
but
not
at
the
front
of
the
pack
appearance
is
black
with
heavy
lacing
smell
is
ripe
with
hot
wild
turkey
biurbon
and
plenty
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
a
stiff
helping
of
barrel
char
character
taste
starts
with
rich
chocolate
that
is
somewhat
thin
heavy
on
vanilla
and
booze
light
waves
of
fudge
followed
by
heat
taste
is
more
of
the
same
light
cocoa
and
vanilla
with
light
oak
and
bourbon
quality
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
worth
a
try
o
id
drink
more
of
it
but
it
would
not
be
a
top
choice
o
not
exactly
why
anderson
valley
would
take
a
medium
bodied
base
stout
which
cant
hold
up
to
a
barrel
and
throw
it
in
a
barrel
not
enough
body
on
this
and
really
not
all
that
great
overall
should
not
be
served
cold
drinks
bigger
than
6

has
a
little
bit
too
much
bourbon
barrel
influence

streaks
of

form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted

cocoa
cookie
dough
wood
and
a
mild
bourbon

taste
is
much
the

with
a
slight
tartness
to
it
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the

with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
barrel

flavor
wise
is
subdued

update
had
this
on
tap
at
rogue
in
san
francisco
lots
of
vanilla
fruity
with
hints
of
mango
and
pineapple
warm
rich
and
seriously
drinkable
the
beer
simply
exudes
class
both
from
the
stout
and
bourbon
standpoints
this
new
barney
flats
variation
is
much
more
than
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
its
a
collaboration
of
taste
that
dovetail
together
perfectly
overall
i
was
a
bit
concerned
about
wild
turkey
barrels
being
used
as
its
too
harsh
for
me
to
enjoy
straight
but
this
changed
my
mind
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
the
regular
stout
but
i
dont
recall
it
being
exceptional
this
aging
really
raises
it
up
a
notch
not
enough
people
are
barrel
aging
lower
strength
brews
it
really
let
the
bourbon
character
come
out
while
not
overshadowing
the
base
beer
excellent
balance
o
this
is
a
nice
easy
to
drink
bourbon
barrel
aged
stout
that
has
a
pleasant
aroma
but
lacks
the
complexity
in
the
taste
that
some
of
the
other
barrel
aged
beers
have
had
a
pint
at
idle
hands
in
nyc
i
havent
had
many
nonimperial
stouts
aged
with
bourbon
that
had
a
good
balance
but
damn
this
is
fine
beer
the
smooth
toast
and
vanilla
liquor
notes
play
off
the
roasted
barley
with
touches
of
coffee
sweet
chocolate
and
oats
its
a
mediumweight
stout
just
big
enough
to
carry
all
the
flavors
overall
its
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
and
i
went
back
to
the
bar
for
a
second
i
guess
this
is
an
appropriate
beer
for
nfl
draft
night
hopeful
anticipation
followed
by
a
let
down
from
a
usually
great
cleveland
brewery
the
cleveland
browns
of
stouts
tastes
like
belgian
dark
chocolate
and
vanilla
beans
which
yields
great
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
vanilla
and
caramel
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
bittersweet
finish
nose
is
roast
dark
malt
and
creamy
cocoa
a
little
dry
definite
hazelnut
and
a
complex
finish
and
lactic
oaty
creaminess
this
beer
poured
out
wonderfully
with
a
very
nice
head
and
very
good
lacing
pretty
distributed
in
the
smell
almost
nothing
there
for
the
noise
taste
isnt
too
bad
tasty
chocolate
and
hint
of
vanilla
but
the
aftertaste
was
lacking
mouth
feel
was
ok
a
bit
creamy
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
for
a
stout
a
previous
reviewer
suggested
pairing
oompa
loompa
with
a
quality
cheddar
cheese
and
i
would
concur
with
that
fine
suggestion
this
is
a
great
choco
cream
stout
that
is
far
less
sweet
and
root
beery
than
samuel
smiths
version
i
highly
recommend
this
one
fatheads
knows
beer
this
is
one
to
find
o
another
good
brew
from
fat
heads
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
two
inch
light
brown
bubbly
head
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
big
dark
chocolate
malts
roasted
malts
and
some
espresso
it
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
but
there
is
something
there
thats
a
bit
offputting
medium
body
creamy
and
roasty
smooth
all
the
way
through
not
really
bitter
or
sticky
overall
its
an
alright
brew
but
was
hoping
for
more
not
a
bad
stout
at
all
but
a
little
light
in
the
body
and
heavy
in
the
carbonation
for
me
to
consider
it
excellent
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
stout
this
is
certainly
a
viable
option
stupidly
drinks
real
easily
and
one
of
the
nicer
simpler
stouts
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
thanks
kbuzz
for
the
opportunity
o
a
worthwhile
try
but
nothing
special
overall
an
excellent
american
stout
that
i
will
look
forward
to
every
year
fatheads
oompa

choclate
cream

is
sweet
stout
that
pours
jet
black
with
just
a
touch
of
raisin
plum
color
when
held
to
a
light
colossal
head
more
head
than
violet
beaurgarde
on
prom
night
about
three
fingers
tall
and
lasted
for
what
seemed
more
than
a
whimsical
whim
palette
was
fuller
than
augustus
gloop
and
had
enough
cream
to
make
you
feel
about
as
glutinous
nose
is
mocha
root
beer
vanilla
buttery
and
had
more
coco
to
make
arthur

taste
is
just
a

butterscotch

chocolate

rounding

this
is
the
golden

is
a
bit
bitter
and
very
sweet
mr
turkentine
says
odds
are
this
is
a
brew
you
will
approve
of
i
think
grandpa
joe
would
agree
to
bad
you
need
a
veruca
salt
pedigree
to
acquire
it
overall
91
the
body
is
full
but
theres
an
almost
spritzy
impression
simply
from
the
abundance
of
the
carbonation
theres
plenty
of
creaminess
but
as
the
char
comes
in
it
dries
it
out
at
the
back
of
the
throat
a
little
though
more
roast
is
preferred
this
darker
chocolate
ale
really
lets
the
cream
and
cocoa
sing
it
pairs
particularly
well
with
sharp
white
cheddar
cheese
cabot
in
this
case
overall
nice
to
try
this
but
nothing
special
a
straightforward
semisweet
stout
that
is
much
too
thin
pours
jet
black
with
a
small
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
roast
and
chocolate
in
the
taste
lots
of
chocolate
up
front
with
a
small
spice
underneath
a
small
spice
like
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
and
dry
spice
of
cinnamon
and
all
spice
in
the
aftertaste
quite
nice
just
the
wrong
time
of
year
for
me
its
a
really
nice
stout
fairly
sweet
for
a
stout
but
never
over
the
top
or
cloying
the
bittersweet
chocolate
provides
both
the
sweet
and
the
bitter
for
a
surprising
easy
to
drink
beer
o
pretty
unique
stout
i
dont
love
it
but
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
worth
picking
up
if
you
want
a
stout
without
all
the
bodyweight
of
an
imperial
and
it
could
easily
blend
into
almost
a
lineup
highlighting
various
styles
from
beer
to
beer
without
being
overbearing
i
have
to
knock
the
mouthfeel
it
isnt
creamy
enough
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
but
no
stick
no
real
creaminess
it
might
be
better
with
nitro
this
is
a
tale
i
two
beers
as
is
out
o
the
bottle
it
is
over
carbonated
for
my
taste
and
what
i
expect
with
the
style
this
carbonation
distracts
me
too
much
and
i
cannot
really
appreciate
the
chocolate
and
the
dark
roasted
malt
so
i
swish
it
around
in
my
glass
for
a
while
and
the
beer
improves
dramatically
i
think
they
have
a
good
base
recipe
on
this
one
and
once
they
get
the
carbonation
right
they
will
have
something
here
o
kind
of
a
letdown
was
hoping
for
more
chocolate
and
less
bubbles
the
aroma
features
such
fancy
as
acidic
roast
earthy
chocolate
detritus
and
watery
vanilla
the
taste
is
a
little
better
than
the
aroma
but
both
the
flavors
and
the
feel
are
puffy
hollow
and
vapid
the
vanilla
is
really
out
of
place
and
the
roast
is
pathetically
weak
its
basically
a
tangy
bitterness
the
chocolate
becomes
a
little
more
plush
but
not
not
enough
to
save
the
beer
no
if
anything
it
adds
unneeded
sweetness
the
carbonation
is
such
that
it
would
be
spoton
with
an
excellent
beer
but
all
it
does
here
is
portray
the
shortcomings
of
oompa
loompa
overall
a
nicely
done
stout
with
some
nice
chocolate
and
roast
qualities
i
wasnt
blown
away
however
and
i
feel
there
are
much
better
stouts
out
there
thanks
to
hopface
for
this
extra
the
label
is
classic
fatheads
dude
as
an
oompa
loompa
the
beer
sounds
sickeningly
sweet
thank

gods
and

not
the
case
here

rolling
in
the
backend
flavor
has
a
balanced

with
dark
chocolate
cacao

not
overtly
creamy
or
sweet

to

flavor
with
layered

additions
peaking

some
warming

shows
up
a
bit
which
is

considering
its

lingering
bitterness
from
dark
chocolate
and
herbal
hops
breaking
through
just
barely
medium
to
full
bodied
with
flowing
carbonation
levels
goes
down
extremely
smooth
and
easy
overall
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
regular
fatheads
lineup
roasted
dark
chocolate
bitterness
intermingles
with
hints
of
vanilla
bean
again
thank
the
beer
gods
and
matt
cole
for
having
the
foresight
not
to
make
this
a
lactose
bomb
in

its
very
much
balanced
and

it
paired
well
with
the
spicy
nicaraguan
tobacco
and
dark
tannins
of
the
rich
cigar
which
brought
leather
spice
pepper
and
black
walnuts
to
the
party
lactosey
sourness
mingles
with
a

and
has
a

of
nuttiness
mouthfeel
blows
goats
overcarbonated
and
flabby
body
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
i
like
the
idea
and
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
does
not
deliver
sweet
creamy
chocolaty
goodness
bummer
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
stout
scents
and

are
muted
and
its

if

not
my

excellent
sweetbitter

deep

great

roasted

very

just
enough
coffee
overall
a
great

this
is
the
gold
standard
for
coffee
stouts
i
like
this
good
level
of
alcohol
at
a
level
that
i
think
works
well
would
drink
this
one
again
tons
of
coffee
flavor
not
overly
carbonated
or
overly
boozy
both
of
which
are
good
things
i
definitely
plan
to
have
this
again
taste
like
fresh
coffee
great
stout
taste
is
of
deep
coffee
grounds
roasted
malt
and
slight
bitter
hops
super
roasty
this
is
a
coffee
beer
for
coffee
lovers
one
to
try
but
for
me
i
have
had
more
balanced
beers
in
the
style
overall
ok
stout
overall
not
bad
nice
flavors
of
malt
and
coffee
with
some
good
sweetness
but
just
a
tad
too
much
of
the
coffee
bitterness
for
me
to
really
really
like
it
this
is
our
favorite
coffee
stout
have
tried
all
i
find
but
this
one
always
stands
out
in
the
palate
pretty
nice
lots
of
bitterness
and
a
tad
thin
but
smells
great
and
tastes
less
filling
good
beer
overall
a
nice
beer
to
accompany
a
sweet
dessert
pretty
decent
stout
overall
pretty
good
it
has
a
great
nose
the
taste
had
some
good
aspects
but
dropped
off
on
the
cocoa
and
fudge
while
increasing
the
roasty
slightly
acrid
burnt
notes
and
big
on
bitterness
it
had
some
great
characters
and
was
tasty
in
general
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
made
this
feel
like
it
was
a
lot
bigger
and
syrupier
than
it
actually
was
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
have
made
the
mouth
pop
a
bit
more
and
the
flavors
come
out
more
and
i
think
it
would
have
bumped
up
quite
a
bit
4
beautifully
black
thick
and
creamy
tan
head
wonderful
aroma
of
malty
sweetness
combined
with
coconut
surprisingly
less
coffee
than
i
would
have
thought
noted
in
the
aroma
it
present
in
the
flavor
though
starts
stouty
fades
to
sweet
notes
of
roasted
coconut
finish
with
bitter
coffee
flavor
could
be
flatter
nitro
tap
would
be
awesome
i
want
to
taste
all
of
this
with
no
co2
interference
this
is
an
excellent
brew
coffee
is
surely
there
but
very
nicely
balanced
and
not
overpowering
i
would
describe
it
as
a
fbs
less
the
oatmeal
and
a
toned
down
on
the
beans
roasted
chocolate
malts
with
a
very
good
aroma
a
little
on
the
thinwatery
side
but
very
well
done
overall
i
would
give
it
a
4
outstanding
o
pretty
decent
but
it
feels
like
the
coffee
beans
were
a
little
green
o
this
is
really
well
done
and
actually
my
new
favorite
coffee
stout
it
beats
bells
java
stout
by
a
few
points
in
my
book
i
just
wish
i
could
get
this
in
my
area
really
a
fantastic
coffee
stout
that
puts
the
coffee
front
and
center
without
overwhelming
awesome
brew
this
also
has

good

light
roast
and
heavy
coffee
bean
note
clean
but
simple
taste
is
a
bit
more
roasted
stronger
heavy
roast
coffee
and
bitterness
towards
the
back
faint
chocolate
and
burnt
caramel
in
the
finish
body
is
medium
and
creamy
with
strong
carbonation
overall
nice
amount
of
coffee
which
is
appreciated
by
this
habitual
coffee
drinker
comes
together
well
good
mouthfeel
a
good
coffee
stout
nice
body
good
consistency
apparently
very
easy
to
drink
as
i
blew
through
it
before
i
got
to
reviewing
it
i
guess
i
have
had
a
lot
of
coffee
stouts
at
this
point
so
my
standards
are
high
this
is
good
enough
but
not
enough
to
really
jar
my
attention
or
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
o
a
nice
full
flavor
coffee
stout
verdict
a
decent
coffee
stout
from
evolution
the
nose
offered
some
promise
but
it
was
just
too
roasty
and
toasted
for
my
palate
the
dry
finish
didnt
offer
any
consolation
nor
did
the
weak
body
but
for
someone
looking
for
an
out
and
out
coffee
stout
this
should
definitely
hit
the
spot
i
would
still
recommend
the
lot
6
dipa
from
evo
before
this
but
still
a
great
drink
if
you
can
find
it
overall
a
rather
odd
experience
a
flat
beer
which
still
tasted
pretty
good
have
another
in
the
fridge
and
if
its
significvantly
different
ill
rereview
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
lot
of
biting
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
and
very
delicious
coffee
stout
bottle
poured
a
deep
black
color
stout
with
a
nice
large
dark
brown
foamy
head
with
light
retention
and
almost
no
retention
aroma
of
floral
coffee
notes
is
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
floral
coffee
notes
with
some
light
black
chocolate
notes
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
style
and
lack
some
creaminess
coffee
notes
are
really
great
but
body
is
a
bit
too
thin
for
the
style
really
delicious
coffee
beer
that
i
call
12
bcbcs
because
i
like
how
it
looks
at
12
the
abv
beautiful
black
crimson
highlights
very
nice
big
coffee
aroma
and
taste
while
not
forgetting
its
a
stout
finishes
dry
more
bitter
than
sweet
fruity
coffee
overall
outstanding
well
worthy
of
its
number
1
ranking
and
12
per
4
makes
this
a
best
buy
o
very
good
easy
drinking
coffee
stout
overall
coffee
like
whoa
might
not
be
super
complex
but
the
coffee
is
boss
o
i
cant
remember
when
i
got
this
only
knowing
that
i
picked
it
up
at
capones
i
will
search
this
one
out
again
it
is
as
good
as
any
coffee
beer
made
bravo
d
big
appearance
big
aroma
big
flavor
big
mouthfeel
all
at
a
respectable
6
8
abv
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
stouts
out
there
i
have
no
complaints
and
no
suggestions
for
improvement
highly
enjoyable
as
are
many
of
the
recent
evolution
brews
ive
sampled
they
are
starting
to
turnout
some
really
solid
brews
and
deserve
to
be
recognized
overall
this
is
the
way
i
feel
stout
should
be
very
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
now
i
need
to
find
this
on
tap
a
very
solid
coffee
stout
with
some
nice
hop
characteristics
to
it
overall
a
sip
of
this
does
it
no
justice
a
whole
glass
and
youll
want
more
and
more
the
comparison
to
founders
breakfast
stout
is
close
but
this
lacks
a
bit
of
the
depth
that
fbss
malt
flavor
has
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
to
come
out
of
evolution
so
far
and
when
i
have
a
hankering
for
a
coffee
stout
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
up
a
4pack
on
draft
at
the
high
spot
in
cambridge
pours
thick
and
dark
with
small
brown
head
aroma
of
earthy
coffee
and
some
sweet
chocolate
flavor
follows
with
a
creamy
motuhfeel
with
prickly
carbonation
at
the
front
sweet
chocolate
and
bitter
earth
balance
well
medium
to
heavy
mouthfeel
very
nice
beer
surprising
from
something
out
of
salisbury
this
is
a
damn
fine
coffee
stout
and
it
really
impressed
this
should
be
included
in
discussion
among
the
elite
in
the
category
excellent
job
evolution
o
heavy
on
the
dark
roast
more
so
than
the
majority
of
the
stouts
out
there
o
ive
seemingly
had
a
billion
coffee
stouts
recently
but
this
is
the
one
that
could
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
as
the
fbswnb
pantheon
and
not
get
embarrassed
as
a
result
it
definitely
deserves
to
be
the
3
rated
american
stout
on
ba
o
big
bold
flavors
bordering
on
an
imperial
stout
with
the
body
and
flavor
huge
coffee
flavor
that
jumps
out
right
away
very
nice
very
quaffable
the
coffee
notes
a
strikingly
similar
to
founders
breakfast
stout
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
solid
take
on
a
coffee
stout
with
well
hidden
alcohol
i
love
how
fresh
the
coffee
character
was
in
this
without
turning
musty
and
stale
i
would
drink
this
again
for
sure
thanks
again
heath
o
excellent
coffee
stout
great
flavors
and
aromas
overall
a
somewhat
unbalance
stout
that
left
me
somewhat
disappointed
dry
and
bitter
finish
as
well
left
an
ashtray
flavor
in
my
mouth
dont
recommend
this
stout
so
many
better
options
out
there
d
one
of
the
best
coffee
flavors
i
have
experienced
in
a
brew
super
fresh
great
on
the
nose
and
on
the
drink
im
sure
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
to
this
one
from
evolution
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
ill
be
having
more
in
the
future
overall
a
real
solid
coffee
stout
certainly
the
nose
seems
my
favorite
but
also
better
than
many
others
ive
had
o
a
great
stout
with
a
ton
of
coffee
i
have
had
imperial
stout
that
have
had
less
flavor
than
this
hard
to
believe
this
is
a
stout
under
7
abv
very
happy
i
can
buy
bottles
of
this
now
o
i
am
thrilled
that
evolution
has
decided
to
bottle
this
stuff
with
the
huge
aromas
and
flavors
it
is
hard
not
to
compare
this
to
some
of
the
best
double
stouts
out
there
while
it
may
not
live
up
to
some
of
the
big
boys
it
is
damn
close
at
the
very
least
it
is
the
best
american
stout
not
double
i
have
had
grab
this
one
if
you
can
get
it
o
it
could
be
a
bit
creamier
and
the
metallic
taste
throws
things
off
but
for
a
small
maryland
brewery
barely
anyones
heard
of
it
aint
too
shabby
served
in
a
nonic
a
glowing
onyx
color
with
a
small
creamy
tan
head
that
displayed
moderate
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
coffee
and
cream
presumably
this
is
a
milk
stout
moderate
roastiness
nice
taste
that
reflects
the
smell
rich
coffee
smooth
cream
dark
malt
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
that
came
out
more
as
the
beer
warmed
body
was
not
quite
full
but
still
rich
and
overall
tasty
and
drinkable
id
imagine
this
would
make
an
amazing
nitro
beer
oit
a
very
drinkable
stout
i
love
soda
a
lot
and
the
drinkability
on
this
reminds
me
of
soda
definitely
something
ill
go
back
to
an
recommend
to
others
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
to
finish
off
the
night
with
it
would
work
well
as
a
desert
beer
with
some
vanilla
cake
or
even
ice
cream
by
the
end
you
suddenly
realize
that
you
should
have
had
two
pints
pulled
because
you
would
just
hate
yourself
if
you
couldnt
enjoy
another
glass
brought
home
a
growler
of
this
from
the
tap
house
in
salisbury
a
delicious
stout
that
is
very
sessionable
and
super
smooth
a
nice
hop
character
but
great
additions
of
malt
really
add
to
the
taste
along
with
a
great
mouthfeel
and
creaminess
on
the
palette
too
bad
its
only
available
on
tap
but
definitely
near
the
top
of
the
list
on
american
stouts
ive
tried
o
a
very
tasty
blend
of
dark
possibly
black
patent
malts
espressolike
organic
coffee
bittersweetness
and
a
sturdy
6
8
abv
to
support
everything
this
was
an
exceptional
american
coffee
stout
stylized
with
a
caribbean
flair
m
medium
bodied
drinks
like
its
less
abv
couldnt
believe
it
was
mid6s
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
coffee
stout
and
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
so
far
from
evolution
the
nose
and
body
were
great
and
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
would
like
to
have
it
again
this
is
truly
a
great
stout
although
i
stumled
upon
this
id
seek
this
out
for
sure
beer
is
medium
in
body
nice
finish
pretty
bitter
with
the
coffee
but
not
overly
so
as
far
as
a
coffee
stout
goes
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
glad
i
got
to
try
it
the
wife
loved
it
too
id
have
it
again
very
nice
robust
caramel
smell
mixed
with
aromas
of
coffee
and
hints
of
roasted
nuts
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
overall
not
bad
first
impression
was
really
just
the
perfect
carbonation
great
frothy
and
fluffy
mouthfeel
and
just
all
around
benefit
to
the
palate
lots
of
caramel
flavors
and
again
a
bit
of
a
smoked
hint
at
the
back
small
flavors
of
roasted
nuits
chocolate
and
hints
at
black
coffee
very
nice
this
has
a
good
creamy
stout
feel
im
not
a
huge
stout
fan
but
have
been
recently
warming
up
a
bit
to
them
this
one
is
amazing
beer
with
the
coffee
smell
and
once
it
warms
is
a
real
treat
to
drink
this
one
is
all
about
the
coffee
pours
a
murky
black
smells
like
a
fresh
pot
of
strongly
brewed
coffee
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
coffee
but
not
so
much
that
you
cant
get
some
hints
of
other
stout
qualities
in
there
chocolate
vanilla
a
slight
touch
of
alchohol
warmth
etc
actually
found
it
to
be
quite
sessionable
for
me
and
almost
killed
the
entire
growler
in
one
night
the
rest
i
had
with
my
breakfast
the
next
morning
if
you
like
coffee
stouts
as
i
do
if
you
get
the
chance
i
would
not
pass
this
one
up
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
makes
for
a
good
accompaniment
to
breakfast
the
beers
color
is
a
rich
dark
brown
with
minimal
light
visible
the
has
a
soft
coffee
aroma
but
is
by
no
means
overpowering
subtle
hints
of
chocolate
can
also
be
sensed
the
the
nose
the
beers
taste
is
velvety
and
smooth
light
in
body
with
a
mild
coffee
flavor
soft
finish
the
coffee
stout
is
not
as
robust
as
others
which
taste
like
a
double
expresso
but
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
light
body
easy
drinking
coffee
stout
this
beer
is
perfect
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
cola
like
color
with
a
two
finger
khaki
color
head
which
gives
way
to
some
decent
lace
the
aroma
is
of
big
big
coffee
along
with
some
dark
chocolate
there
are
aslo
hints
of
vanilla
present
the
smell
is
big
and
bold
very
inviting
the
taste
is
of
big
coffee
and
is
balalnced
out
by
dark
chocolate
there
is
also
a
nice
oaky
vanilla
taste
to
bring
even
more
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
but
slightly
watery
overall
a
very
good
beer
nice
big
nose
and
a
big
bold
flavor
one
of
the
smoother
and
more
balanced
coffee
beers
you
will
run
into
o
i
like
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
based
off
the
aroma
since
it
is
over
the
top
coffee
grinds
for
anyone
that
likes
coffee
beer
this
one
is
for
them
the
low
abv
makes
this
extremely
drinkable
also
had
this
infused
with
oak
chips
and
vanilla
which
imo
made
it
even
better
it
cut
some
of
the
coffee
and
drew
out
more
of
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
o
this
is
how
you
do
a
low
abv
stout
really
complex
rich
and
extremely
drinkable
i
throughly
enjoyed
this
one
a
growler
fill
may
be
in
my
future
thumbs
up
yet
another
winner
from
evo
this
is
a
very
nice
local
coffee
stout
much
better
than
flying
dogs
recent
take
imo
but
the
carbonation
issues
remind
me
of
the
lesser
batches
of
planet
bean
and
make
the
flavor
one
dimensional
d
thin
mouth
with
less
than
8
abv
make
this
extremely
drinkable
with
big
chewy
stouts
at
1012
abv
you
have
one
or
two
and
youre
full
this
is
what
i
think
the
definition
of
a
session
stout
should
be
compared
to
others
in
the
class
its
very
good
but
not
the
top
of
the
heap
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
strong
and
pungent
as
the
nose
and
this
is
perhaps
due
to
the
mouthfeel
which
is
a
bit
thin
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
big
creamy
body
that
i
would
expect
from
the
wondrous
nose
while
the
feel
is
a
bit
thin
the
drinkability
on
this
is
sky
high
beautiful
coffee
notes
and
a
not
overwhelming
amount
of
coffee
d
an
intense
coffee
flavor
makes
this
a
very
good
drink
ill
share
a
pint
or
so
with
ksak
but
thats
it
the
rest
is
mine
dm
deff
a
session
beer
but
is
smooth
and
velvety
on
the
tongue
and
is
not
overly
carbonated
the
beer
poured
incredibly
black
and
syrupy
into
a
pint
glass
the
head
was
tan
and
thick
with
toffee
chocolate
and
burnt
toast
aromas
very
nice
a
wonderfully
smooth
low
carbonation
mouthfeel
viscous
with
burnt
toast
black
malt
and
toffee
flavors
dominating
a
lingering
burnt
toast
aftertaste
with
malt
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
a
fantastic
stout
d
an
exceptional
american
stout
not
imperial
or
double
imo
but
plenty
of
flavor
from
the
coffee
so
no
mistaking
that
the
stout
is
easy
to
drink
even
for
6
8
it
deserves
a
5
for
sheer
quality
of
brew
and
flavor
of
the
coffee
the
cold
drip
method
was
utilized
per
brewery
repit
has
given
the
beer
such
balanced
coffee
taste
havent
had
a
beer
from
them
that
i
didnt
enjoy
yet
and
the
rise
up
stout
continues
that
trend
if
you
have
a
chance
to
get
this
beer
i
very
very
strongly
recommend
it
very
very
dark
in
color
but
some
minor
ruby
highlights
near
the
edges
of
the
glass
when
held
to
the
light
nice
looking
tan
head
on
top
good
aromamild
coffeeespresso
notes
with
a
decent
roasted
aroma
almost
has
more
of
a
dark
chocolate
scent
to
me
then
a
lot
of
coffee
flavor
is
in
a
wordkiller
perfectly
balanced
roasted
and
coffee
flavors
simply
meld
together
nice
lingering
mocha
flavor
slightest
hint
of
chocolate
roasted
graininess
also
comes
thru
retains
enough
stout
flavor
that
it
isnt
overshadowed
by
the
coffee
great
body
just
a
great
great
beer
and
an
even
better
stout
easily
could
become
a
new
favoritewait
i
think
it
is
awesome
i
love
when
both
a
great
brewery
and
coffee
company
get
together
and
make
a
coffee
stout
baby
of
extreme
awesomeness
like
this
this
was
just
thick
with
java
roast
sweetness
and
the
drinkibility
was
top
notch
be
on
the
look
out
for
this
very
soon
in
12
oz
bottles
in
the
mdde
markets
i
pray
that
this
remains
as
good
as
it
is
on

the

nice
well
made

to
coffee
with
a
nice
dark
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
unlike
an
irish
stout
a
light
hint
of
vanilla
on
the
nose
but
mostly
toasted
malt
notes
cocoa
coffee
and
toffee
the
mouth
feel
in
concert
with
the
flavors
are
almost
immediately
reminiscent
of
a
classic
egg
cream
soda
its
the
carbonation
of
this
beer
that
really
do
that
its
uncanny
actually
it
was
the
first
thing
i
thought
of
upon
my
first
sip
nice
long
finish
and
lingering
aftertaste
really
a
fine
stout
ogood
but
not
great
stout
above
average
but
nothing
special
o
a
good
stout
but
more
coffee
tasting
with
less
vanilla
than
i
was
hoping
for
low
abv
allows
for
multiple
glasses
of
this
fine
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
with
main
ever
overall
wow
what
a
great
stout
tons
of
roasted
malt
and
brown
sugarlike
sweetness
and
vanilla
wrapped
up
in
an
extremely
smooth
beer
delicious
would
prefer
a
stronger
vanilla
taste
as
opposed
to
chocolate
smooth
stout
with
sweet
notes
i
was
happy
the
vanilla
was
not
overpowering
it
was
nicely
balanced
pours
a
dark
brown
with
thick
white
head
smells
of
chocholate
also
hints
of
vanilla
and
caramel
taste
is
dominently
chocholate
with
slight
hints
of
the
vanilla
bean
some
dissapointment
as
would
have
preferd
more
vanilla
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbination
and
drinks
very
smooth
overall
solid
offering
from
maine
any
beer
than
can
incorporate
hints
of
onion
peel
and
pepperoni
paired
with
all
the
expected
coffeelike
vanilla
bean
flavors
is
impressive
to
me
this
beer
is
probably
underrated
but
why
maine
beer
co
does
everything
large
recommended
aroma
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
faint
vanilla
thin
tan
head
with
a
pitch
dark
body
the
vanilla
takes
a
back
seat
in
the
overall
taste
profile
here
gives
this
beer
a
slight
undertone
rather
than
a
sweetness
which
is
a
good
thing
all
things
considered
a
very
good
beer
carbonation
and
roasted
malt
comes
together
almost
a
porter
mouthfeel
not
overly
thick
another
winner
from
the
maine
beer
company
on
nitro
at
blind
tiger
new
years
eve
party
super
coffee
flavor
and
very
creamy
excellent
cheers
overall
its
a
decent
beer
probably
would
not
purchase
again
doesnt
stand
out
exactly
but
it
isnt
a
bad
offering
either
i
dont
understand
why
this
beer
doesnt
receive
higher
marks
very
wellbalanced
with
a
solid
vanilla
flavor
one
of
the
best
maine
has
to
offer
imo
more
coffee
and
chocolate
in
taste
with
vanilla
in
the
nose
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
creaminess
in
mouthfeel
and
more
smoothness
and
vanilla
in
the
taste
surprisingly
tastes
more
like
a
coffee
stout
it
pours
a
lovely
black
color
with
a
beautiful
two
finger
head
of
caramel
colored
foam
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
nose
is
a
little
underwhelming
a
nice
roasted
stout
with
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
taste
is
simply
fantastic
nothing
super
strong
but
a
complex
meld
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
just
a
touch
of
warming
spice
all
finishing
with
a
pleasant
vanilla
aftertaste
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
feel
is
rich
and
creamy
with
a
proper
carbonation
level
this
is
a
bit
pricey
but
the
quality
of
the
ingredients
is
evident
in
the
final
product
its
certainly
worth
a
try
o
overall
its
a
smooth
beer
thats
very
drinkable
im
slightly
disappointed
with
the
flavor
i
expected
more
i
will
try
this
one
again
in
the
future
to
see
if
there
is
any
change
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
other
reviews
on
ba
i
dont
read
them
before
i
review
maine
brewing
doesnt
make
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
assertive
given
the
aroma
presentation
when
i
first
poured
it
dont
go
into
this
expecting
to
be
bowled
over
by
vanilla
after
the
initial
wave
hits
you
it
turns
into
a
relatively
pedestrian
but
extremely
drinkable
dry
stout
i
consider
it
a
bridge
between
a
boring
irish
stout
and
the
more
aggressively
flavored
big
stouts
save
for
the
oatmeal
characteristic
this
could
easily
be
rebranded
a
porter
which
would
be
fine
except
maine
already
makes
an
outstanding
porter
that
mean
old
tom
does
not
want
to
be
compared
to
very
enjoyable
to
sip
and
even
gulp
serving
type
bottle
o
very
good
stout
the
dark
chocolate
malt
dominates
the
added
vanilla
o
nice
complex
flavors
o
yet
another
solidly
made
beer
from
maine
beer
company
well
made
and
drinkable
o
i
was
pretty
excited
to
try
this
beer
besides
the
great
reputation
of
mbc
it
just
looked
and
smelled
the
part
of
a
top
notch
stout
i
mean
just
smelling
this
thing
was
enough
to
put
me
in
a
good
mood
sadly
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
simply
not
up
to
par
it
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
its
actually
quite
good
but
the
taste
letdown
is
just
too
much
well
that
and
the
7
price
tag
for
a
16oz
bottle
but
thats
another
story
high
b
ooverall
a
great
stout
could
use
more
lacing
pours
black
in
body
with
khaki
head
that
melts
down
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
of
cocoa
mild
ash
tobacco
dirt
and
burnt
ends
tastes
of
cocoa
burnt
bread
tobacco
comes
through
toward
the
finish
and
then
cocoa
and
vanilla
come
back
again
surprising
how
smooth
this
beer
is
glad
to
see
it
isnt
a
booze
bomb
either
very
refreshing
despite
the
dry
tone
of
the
flavors
very
good
stuff
very
very
good
stout
vanilla
on
the
very
back
is
light
coffee
dominates
a
bit
less
body
than
anticipated
good
flavor
cannot
go
wrong
with
maine
beer
company
o
was
glad
to
find
another
brew
by
this
maine
brewery
in
chicago
at
whole
foods
drinking
it
aug
25th
2014
in
new
hamburg
on
not
really
a
fan
of
stouts
but
this
is
a
solid
offering
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
very
dark
chocolate
brown
brew
nearly
black
with
little
in
the
way
of
colored
highlights
and
a
large
amount
of
creamy
light
brown
head
for
a
stout
aroma
is
assertive
dark
roast
coffee
and
chocolate
slight
floral
vanilla
and
grassy
hops
on
the
palate
one
gets
more
of
the
same
dark
coffee
and
chocolate
milk
faint
butterscotch
and
red
licorice
starts
quite
sweet
but
dries
out
quickly
an
interesting
contrast
i
am
noticing
a
nice
nutty
malt
character
as
well
a
unique
element
for
this
style
that
is
amplified
over
the
course
of
multiple
sips
very
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
moderately
thick
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
finishes
roasted
and
very
dry
peanut
shells
coming
to
mind
very
light
citrus
hops
wink
in
and
out
they
use
centennial
in
this
the
vanilla
beans
add
a
tinge
of
floral
perfume
and
do
not
dominate
the
proceedings
debates
about
price
points
notwithstanding
i
think
the
ingredients
these
guys
use
and
their
entire
approach
justifies
the
cost
not
to
mention
how
freaking
good
the
beers
are
maine
beer
company
proves
here
that
they
arent
just
hop
wizards
although
i
imagine
i
will
always
prefer
the
hoppy
stuff
from
these
guys
o
mouthfeel
is
there
but
taste
is
of
an
average
dry
irish
style
stout
i
get
no
vanilla
appearance
is
very
dark
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
the
smell
has
a
lot
of
malt
to
it
giving
off
some
very
sweet
aromas
the
taste
is
full
of
dark
chocolate
and
a
little
bit
of
espresso
also
the
vanilla
bean
makes
for
a
semisweet
very
delicious
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
also
nice
consistency
for
a
stout
not
overly
thick
but
with
a
very
defined
body
overall
i
really
liked
it
ill
definitely
pick
up
another
one
soon
o
me
likey
may
be
my
favorite
flavored
stout
due
to
mouthfeel
and
not
overtly
chewy
malty
notes
o
honestly
the
weak
mouthfeel
is
the
only
thing
keeping
mean
old
tom
from
being
a
world
class
stout
the
flavors
are
bombastic
and
incredible
and
the
addition
of
organic
vanilla
bean
flavoring
keeps
this
dark
roasted
behemoth
balanced
and
smooth
truly
delicious
but
not
without
flaws
excellent
taste
with
dark
chocolate
flavor
blending
perfectly
with
the
vanilla
very
drinkable
with
silky
mouth
feel
dark
black
appearance
with
strong
lingering
tan
head
smell
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
is
dessert
like
paired
with
ribeye
steak
and
jalapeño
mash
ended
potatoes
a
well
crafted
rich
not
boozy
interesting
yet
not
complex
beer
i
should
have
bought
a
second
bottle
poured
a
black
body
with
two
finger
khaki
head
and
minor
lace
patches
with
a
coffeeroasted
malt
aroma
that
has
more
than
just
traces
of
both
vanilla
and
chocolate
more
vanilla
than
chocolate
smooth
creamy
the
roasted
coffee
edge
is
there
for
flavor
and
balance
as
well
as
making
the
beer
a
little
more
fuller
bodied
and
have
a
slightly
dry
finish
but
its
the
vanillaespresso
like
sweetness
with
some
chocolate
as
well
that
livened
up
my
sweet
tooth
and
led
me
to
really
like
this
beer
overall
a
quite
enjoyable
stout
with
lots
of
flavor
all
at
a
more
modest
at
least
in
big
flavored
stout
terms
abv
of
only
6
5
this
was
a
rather
nice
roastey
and
sweet
treat
overall
an
american
stout
that
is
more
subdued
than
i
am
used
to
for
the
style
there
are
good
flavours
in
here
but
i
wish
they
were
more
pronounced
well
worth
a
try
but
unlike
the
other
beers
ive
had
from
these
guys
i
dont
think
id
drop
10
on
another
half
litre
bottle
calling
yourself
an
american
porter
may
mean
for
the
most
part
employing
adjuncts
that
the
english
dont
allow
or
particularly
care
for
and
thats
the
problem
here
maine
advertises
the
vanilla
in
the
end
a
sort
of
snakeoil
salesman
move
and
fails
on
the
yankee
hopitude
front
there
is
indeed
a
special
vein
running
through
the
majority
of
this
brewerys
offerings
but
methinks
this
offering
took
one
too
many
sick
days
when
they
were
handing
out
the
decoder
ring
for
that
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
4
finger
brown
head
and
great
retention
aroma
is
coca
and
chocolate
shavings
taste
has
a
nice
semisweet
chocolate
base
but
not
getting
much
vanilla
medium
body
at
best
lacks
a
little
but
a
good
pick
i
think
o
this
is
my
first
sampling
from
maine
beer
co
and
after
this
tasty
treat
will
surely
not
be
my
last
being
readily
available
in
my
area
this
could
become
my
new
go
to
american
stout
excellent
brew
the
vanilla
beans
add
a
nice
creamy
sweetness
that
for
all
purposes
is
subtle
however
the
roasty
stout
base
beer
is
a
great
combination
of
roast
barley
and
deep
dark
chocolate
after
having
this
on
nitro
the
bottled
version
is
a
tad
underwhelming
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
overall
its
pretty
good
not
great
the
first
maine
beer
ive
had
that
im
not
too
interested
in
having
again
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
with
a
tad
chalky
bite
that
makes
for
a
rather
dry
finish
a
nice
quaff
from
a
great
maine
brewer
o
an
enjoyable
hop
forward
stout
with
strong
notes
of
coffee
with
some
nice
vanilla
creamyness
body
is
thinner
than
expected
but
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
recommend
if
you
like
hoppyroasty
stouts
found
them
when
i
was
in
nj
on
business
wish
i
could
get
them
in
sc
would
be
a
nice
dark
beer
to
drink
at
sunset
in
the
lowcountry
heat
first
maine
beer
co
that
i
have
tried
very
nice
dark
stout
with
a
decent
foam
head
smells
of
strong
roast
with
slight
hints
of
vanilla
the
taste
was
more
of
roasted
coffee
than
chocolate
for
me
and
the
vanilla
is
there
too
hop
bitterness
to
boot
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
where
this
beer
worked
for
me
medium
bodied
smooth
soft
like
maybe
velvet
clean
and
so
wellbalanced
to
conclude
ive
rated
this
low
abv
stout
quite
high
even
though
i
prefer
my
stouts
super
strong
in
taste
thickness
and
alcohol
overall
there
was
nothing
i
did
not
like
about
this
brew
and
it
actually
took
me
by
surprise
very
well
done
maine
beer
company
gentle
carbonation
lends
a
smoothnes
to
the
front
end
that
is
quickly
nicely
washed
away
by
burnt
barley
roughness
this
segues
into
a
semisweet
finish
of
bakers
chocolate
coffee
and
fresh
vanilla
bean
stout
style
creates
an
obviously
dark
appearance
with
nice
head
retention
little
to
no
aroma
the
bitterness
is
rather
subdued
for
a
stout
though
the
beer
was
brewed
with
vanilla
beans
i
also
picked
up
on
an
almost
salty
chocolatey
note
the
mouth
feel
was
velvety
and
incredibly
smooth
overall
a
great
choice
for
the
stout
category
of
which
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
pours
very
dark
with
extremely
dark
head
lots
of
coffee
vanilla
on
the
nose
very
roasty
flavor
matches
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
hops
light
to
medium
bodied
creamy
fluffy
feel
very
nice
brew
indeed
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
milky
sweetness
very
drinkable
pour
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
and
a
fair
bit
of
bubbles
nose
is
moderate
roasted
malt
notes
of
cooked
coffee
bean
with
a
decent
touch
of
vanilla
and
notes
of
dark
chocolate
taste
is
not
sweet
but
does
have
a
good
bit
of
the
vanilla
light
roasted
malts
rich
chocolate
and
vanilla
a
marshmallow
quality
well
balanced
and
not
sugary
pretty
well
done
medium
body
and
incredibly
smooth
feel
with
gentle
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
this
bottle
was
originally
purchased
to
honor
a
friend
who
recently
joined
the
ranks
of
the
elderly
while
im
not
sure
if
he
enjoyed
the
homage
the
beer
was
enjoyed
with
lengthy
nonsensical
conversation
a
second
bottle
was
aged
about
ten
months
which
mellowed
out
the
alcohol
and
the
vanilla
aged
or
not
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
works
as
well
on
a
warm
day
as
a
cold
windy
november
evening
a
pretty
good
stout
with
nice
flavor
and
aroma
in
a
lowerabv
package
very
enjoyable
and
worth
trying
m
medium
bodied
maybe
a
touch
to
much
carbonation
wish
i
was
a
tad
creamier
o
my
first
mbc
it
was
a
good
beer
delicious
not
a
revelation
but
well
executed
i
might
have
been
a
bit
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
vanilla
notes
if
it
werent
for
the
fact
that
it
is
so
easy
for
those
to
become
overpowering
and
this
was
such
a
decent
brew
that
i
didnt
miss
them
they
know
dark
beer
at
mbc
i
love
the
king
titus
porter
this
one
is
pitch
black
big
tan
head
forms
thick
and
leaves
fine
even
lacing
aroma
has
dark
chocolate
malts
roasted
malt
brings
out
hints
of
coffee
and
the
beer
was
aged
on
vanilla
beans
so
therefore
theres
a
define
creaminess
on
the
nose
to
bring
it
all
together
dark
chocolate
bitterness
on
the
palate
creamy
vanilla
beans
with
a
hint
of
acidic
coffee
notes
from
the
dark
malts
because
im
pretty
sure
theres
no
coffee
in
this
brew
no
signs
of
oxidation
bottled
on
121013
im
okay
with
that
its
a
bottle
i
bought
in
pittsburgh
yet
mbc
is
not
distributed
here
yet
the
nose
is
magnificent
the
flavor
is
sufficient
and
its
a
damn
solid
beer
creamy
smooth
natural
carbonation
the
palate
goes
down
way
too
easily
overall
a
very
stand
up
solid
beer
that
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
when
i
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
after
pour
has
a
nice
thick
head
and
good
initial
smell
vanilla
is
certainly
present
but
not
overpowering
i
get
some
good
roasted
malt
with
coffee
as
well
taste
has
some
chocolate
light
coffee
toastyness
and
only
a
slight
amount
of
vanilla
went
down
smooth
but
just
wasnt
as
impressed
as
i
expected
to
be
from
maine
ill
be
sure
to
drink
a
lunch
next
time
instead
rich
and
roasty
with
a
tangy
hop
profile
and
a
good
dose
of
vanilla
faint
coffee
bitterness
and
flavor
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
dryness
behind
this
stout
really
makes
it
that
much
more
palatable
quality
roasted
malts
and
floral
hops
with
a
glimpse
of
pine
awesome
mouthfeel
with
a
velvety
body
and
an
elegant
carbonation
level
good
stuff
o
solid
offering
reasonably
priced
would
recommend
but
i
have
to
say
leaves
you
wanting
could
use
more
vanilla
more
coffee
notes
o
a
nice
beer
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
but
i
actually
enjoyed
how
drinkable
it
was
as
a
consequence
and
the
complement
of
flavors
was
really
nice
i
was
giving
this
beer
credit
for
the
vanilla
that
was
nearly
imperceptible
partly
due
to
the
bottle
being
slightly
past
its
enjoy
by
recommendation
that
said
ive
typically
not
had
vanilla
fall
off
like
that
so
maybe
there
just
wasnt
much
to
begin
with
pours
a
nice
opaque
black
with
some
tan
head
and
a
nice
medium
collar
good
lacing
out
of
this
one
aroma
is
really
deep
roasted
malt
some
faint
coffee
and
earthy
too
taste
is
where
the
vanilla
comes
out
vanilla
up
front
char
and
roasted
malt
in
the
middle
then
fades
into
a
sweet
dark
caramel
nice
thick
body
and
low
carbonation
very
good
but
the
whole
time
i
felt
there
was
just
something
offputting
pours
a
dark
brown
color
off
white
forms
and
retains
well
aroma
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
not
so
much
vanilla
in
the
taste
vanilla
coffee
smoke
and
sweet
malts
quite
nice
and
coffee
like
a
bit
of
vanilla
as
it
warms
nice
citrus
hops
with
mild
acidity
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
brew
with
vanilla
coffee
and
hops
in
the
finish
tasty
brew
through
and
through
i
pounded
it
but
i
didnt
particularly
enjoy
it
like
nights
of
youthful
indiscretion
i
kept
my
eyes
shut
maybe
this
is
mean
by
maine
standards
but
here
in
wisconsin
we
well
shit
most
everybodys
nice
but
still
this
aint
all
that
mean
500
ml
bottle
into
tulip
glass
bottled
on
1012013
pours
pitch
black
color
with
a
2
finger
dense
dark
tan
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
around
the
glass
aromas
of
big
milk
chocolate
vanilla
roasted
malt
cocoa
light
coffee
caramel
toast
oats
light
floral
and
roasted
earthiness
damn
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
and
complexity
of
darkroast

and
vanilla
notes
with
light
hops
and
good
strength
taste
of
dark
chocolate
cocoa

roasted

vanilla

light
char
floral
light

and
roasted

fair

of

coffee
roasted

toast
oats
vanilla
caramel
light
char
floral
and
roasted
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
very
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
darkroasted
malt
flavors
with
light
vanilla
and
hop
presence
with
good
robustness
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
moderately
creamy
and
slightly
chalky
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
stout
all
around
good
balance
robustness
and
complexity
of
darkroasted
malt
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
vanilla
was
much
more
prominent
in
the
aromas
than
the
flavors
but
it
was
very
enjoyable
offering
otherwise
overall
this
one
gets
a
thumbs
up
a
nice
light
easy
drinking
stout
as
a
fanatic
of
the
style
i
could
drink
this
in
the
summer
time
bottle
dated
7213
poured
on
122713
shared
with
dad
says
drink
within
90
days
but
whatever
dark
brown
to
black
pour
with
a
light
brown
creamy
half
finger
head
aroma
of
huge
roast
and
light
vanilla
some
smoke
semisweet
chocolate
flavor
follows
the
smell
with
big
roast
and
semisweet
chocolate
light
vanilla
and
lingering
bitter
roast
lingers
medium
carbonation
and
light
medium
body
this
comes
off
as
a
porter
rather
than
a
stout
and
with
that
expectation
is
very
nice
recommended
for
lighter
stout
fare
for
sure
on
the
flipside
its
very
well
balanced
this
is
a
good
beer
but
my
palate
needs
something
a
little
more
exciting
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
with
less
emphasis
on
the
vanilla
beans
and
more
so
on
the
baked
dark
chocolate
the
slightest
touch
of
dry
bitterness
on
the
backside
very
nice
beer
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
it
was
much
much
better
vegetal
flavors
coming
through
the
palate
and
dominating
pretty
soundly
over
the
light
vanilla
characteristic
ive
known
before
on
this
brew
what
happened
here
minus
points
for
really
only
the
flavor
but
im
probably
sensitive
and
its
still
a
good
stout
o
enjoyable
stout
that
isnt
heavy
at
all
and
is
super
easy
to
drink
a
nice
low
abv
at
6
5
makes
this
a
nice
stout
to
drink
and
wont
set
you
on
your
ass
each
sip
makes
you
want
to
keep
going
back
for
more
and
more
for
sure
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
in
the
future
really
enjoyed
this
its
a
mediumbodied
stout
with
a
lasting
roast
flavor
very
well
balanced
not
too
high
in
alcohol
just
a
very
solid
beer
some
might
say
its
expensive
for
what
it
is
i
believe
i
paid
around
7
for
the
16
9
oz
bottle
but
i
justify
that
by
comparing
its
price
to
what
i
might
pay
at
a
bar
though
anything
is
more
reasonable
that
way
in
any
case
this
is
one
of
the
more
wellbalanced
stouts
that
ive
had
recently
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
capped
by
a
light
beige
one
finger
head
average
retention
a
bit
of
lacing
present
robust
roastiness
espresso
and
accents
of
vanilla
cream
slightly
reminiscent
of
a
vanilla
latte
bakers
chocolate
upfront
and
hints
of
cream
vanilla
beans
join
in
with
continued
dark
chocolate
notes
finishes
with
big
bold
roasted
malt
espresso
notes
and
ample
hops
smoothed
out
by
returning
vanilla
notes
moderately
carbonated
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
bordering
on
full
bodied
smooth
velvety
on
the
palate
exceptional
overall
this
brew
was
much
more
bold
and
robust
than
expected
a
nice
enjoyable
surprise
a
crisp
jazzy
upbeat
side
to
an
aged
stout
roastie
nuts
mild
chocolate
vanilla
and
cream
maybe
a
hint
of
peanut
butter
and
rum
in
the
finish
dry
earthy
hops
provide
a
nice
balance
complexity
is
good
but
the
flavors
could
meld
more
lay
this
one
down
for
3
mounths
and
we
might
just
have
a
true
epic
this
is
an
ordinary
stout
that
is
gets
taken
to
the
next
level
by
the
vanilla
beans
very
drinkable
with
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
very
nice
coffee
like
finish
o
a
solid
option
very
different
than
most
stouts
i
have
tried
give
it
a
try
overall
a
very
tasty
american
stout
o
i
am
not
a
stout
drinker
but
i
decided
to
give
this
one
a
shot
having
luck
with
all
of
the
other
mbc
beers
overall
this
was
an
excellent
brew
very
drinkable
and
tons
of
flavors
definitely
was
very
enjoyable
on
a
cold
vt
night
maine
beer
company
mean
old
tom
45
right
up
there
with
titus
mo
and
peeper
great
stuff
o
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
but
is
a
good
change
of
pace
it
is
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
of
dark
beers
compared
to
maines
hoppy
offerrings
this
one
falls
flat
in
both
body
and
taste
a
thinner
stout
if
you
could
call
it
that
with
some
good
flavors
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
heat
overall
solid
and
goes
down
really
smooth
with
nice
complexity
and
flavor
profile
curious
how
it
would
be
for
a
year
in
bourbon
barrels
o
id
say
that
king
titus
as
a
porter
is
a
better
stout
than
mean
old
tom
is
as
a
stout
overall
a
nice
stout
im
not
a
huge
stout
fan
so
im
perhaps
not
the
best
judge
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
bottle
pours
dark
brown
with
long
lasting
foamy
beige
head
aroma
is
of
toasted
malt
sunflower
seeds
vanilla
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
body
is
medium
and
smooth
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
burnt
grain
vanilla
coffee
chocolate
and
hints
of
dark
fruit
long
finish
is
bittersweet
delicious
stout
this
is
an
extremely
approachable
stout
i
was
hoping
for
more
vanilla
flavor
instead
i
was
left
with
a
strong
burnt
toast
toffee
and
coffee
finish
that
was
far
less
dominating
than
in
other
stouts
this
is
a
very
creamy
and
smooth
brew
and
is
one
of
the
betterpriced
offerings
from
maine
beer
co
o
very
rich
and
tasty
not
too
tart
very
good
stout
froths
up
past
three
fingers
of
loose
foam
mostly
larger
bubbles
lots
of
dimpling
very
dark
brown
coloration
the
lacing
is
wispy
but
has
stickiness
to
spare
pitch
black
liquid
perhaps
a
touch
flat
and
not
a
lot
of
shine
you
can
see
little
pin
pricks
of
carbonation
as
the
bubbles
reach
the
surface
otherwise
opaque
while
theres
a
good
deal
of
roast
to
the
nose
it
is
not
overdone
and
allows
the
chocolate
vanilla
and
licorice
to
sweeten
things
up
date
and
fig
fruit
dose
of
candied
nuts
lasts
well
without
losing
its
relaxed
feel
mediumbodied
plus
has
a
pleasingly
dry
texture
without
sacrificing
flavor
cocoa
milk
chocolate
coffee
more
than
vanilla
carbonation
keeps
it
refreshing
not
fluffy
and
soft
theres
plum
cherry
and
light
fig
going
on
at
times
there
is
some
booziness
odd
given
its
relatively
light
abv
for
the
type
comes
up
with
a
bit
of
mineral
and
earth
for
depth
fashioned
in
a
classic
style
has
length
and
cleanliness
leaves
you
without
much
to
say
preferable
to
just
enjoy
it
great
stout
probably
a
bit
overpriced
but
its
top
shelf
stuff
great
nose
total
4250
o
eh
an
average
stout
with
not
enough
of
the
special
ingredient
that
is
supposed
to
make
it
stand
out
from
the
rest
i
feel
like
an
imperial
oak
aged
vanilla
stout
wouldve
been
a
winning
ticket
this
just
doesnt
have
enough
gusto
for
me
overall
id
drink
this
over
and
over
o
a
very
enjoyable
stout
the
vanilla
bean
is
a
nice
compliment
not
a
bruiser
or
anything
just
well
crafted
highly
drinkable
is
this
a
stout
or
a
black
hop
ipa
couldnt
finish
in
one
seating
so
i
put
in
the
fridge
overnight
finding
the
tanginess
went
away
this
kind
of
stout
had
me
at
one
time
saying
i
could
take
em
or
leave
em
bottom
line
for
me
is
this
is
not
sweet
or
creamyshould
it
be
basically
bitter
coffee
and
bakers
chocolate
with
vanilla
extract
every
stout
has
its
place
poured
into
a
goblet
born
on
date
82612
color
was
a
very
dark
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
nice
1
finger
creamy
light
brown
head
head
thinned
out
fairly
fast
but
left
a
thin
layer
with
plenty
of
lacing
aroma
was
very
slightly
sweet
subtle
chocolate
notes
but
very
faint
with
a
bit
of
brunt
vanilla
flavor
started
off
sweet
than
developed
a
bit
of
tang
with
some
earthiness
that
hung
around
in
the
mouth
mellowed
out
a
bit
over
time
which
made
it
more
enjoyable
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
definitely
hung
around
for
a
while
coated
nicely
but
left
a
slightly
strange
feel
at
the
back
of
the
throat
definitely
showed
potential
but
perhaps
needs
a
bit
more
time
to
mellow
out
this
is
a
great
stout
from
a
great
brewery
it
leads
me
to
want
to
seek
out
more
imperialaged
stouts
will
definitely
buy
again
wow
i
loved
this
beer
i
was
looking
for
something
different
to
go
with
my
steak
i
grab
it
off
the
shelf
warm
brought
it
home
and
poured
it
into
the
glass
it
poured
dark
and
creamy
the
foam
stayed
thick
and
creamy
for
as
long
as
it
took
me
to
drink
i
smelled
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
with
chocolate
tasted
malt
and
chocolate
at
first
the
more
i
drank
the
more
vanilla
i
tasted
i
do
not
know
if
they
barrel
age
this
beer
but
if
they
did
i
would
love
to
try
it
this
is
the
first
maine
brewing
company
beer
i
have
tried
but
it
will
not
be
the
last
additionally
i
drank
this
on
one
of
the
hottest
days
of
the
year
in
the
middle
of
the
day
outside
in
my
back
yard
out
of
my
favorite
tulip
glass
maybe
it
was
because
of
its
thin
body
thin
for
a
stout
or
maybe
because
i
left
it
in
my
fridge
for
a
day
but
it
was
a
great
stout
to
have
in
warm
weather
o
this
is
a
solid
stout
that
i
would
buy
again
i
dont
know
if
i
would
classify
it
as
a
dessert
beer
by
itself
but
the
lower
sweetness
level
might
make
it
nice
to
pair
with
sweet
desserts
the
only
thing
i
really
wanted
was
some
more
of
that
vanilla
to
come
through
on
the
palette
though
the
ales
demeanor
is
bold
and
masculine
its
not
overwrought
either
its
a
sensible
stout
with
impeccable
balance
vanilla
intrigue
and
flawless
in
recipe
design
and
brewing
technique
but
because
of
its
perceived
modesty
itll
never
get
the
notoriety
that
it
deserves
a
near
miss
something
about
the
body
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
it
is
smooth
and
has
some
fantastic
characteristics
but
falls
a
bit
short
for
me
maybe
this
needs
to
be
had
even
sooner
than
the
90
days
stated
on
the
label
that
is
a
question
for
you
to
ponder
my
fellow
beer
pioneers
o
this
is
a
tasty
stout
with
lots
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavors
the
vanilla
bean
aspect
while
present
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
was
hoping
for
a
lot
more
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
great
for
a
stout
good
rich
body
but
not
to
thick
carbonation
is
good
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
stout
the
vanilla
really
shines
through
but
isnt
overdone
at
all
theres
a
great
roasted
malt
character
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
of
the
vanilla
im
really
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
one
thanks
frank
overall
a
nice
stout
nicely
balanced
good
overall
flavor
the
vanilla
brought
a
nice
sweetness
without
being
too
strong
the
smokiness
was
a
little
surprise
but
maybe
that
is
not
the
right
term
enjoyable
will
drink
again
on
tap
had
at
the
brewery
i
would
give
it
a
slightly
higher
rating
it
lost
a
fraction
of
something
in
the
bottle
in
my
opinion
very
dark
to
black
in
color
about
18
inch
head
and
some
light
lacing
strong
aromas
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
wow
very
strong
smokey
burnt
roasted
malt
hits
you
some
dark
chocolate
some
vanilla
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
carbonation
ok
not
weak
didnt
taste
any
smoother
for
the
oats
in
the
brew
a
little
to
strong
and
bitter
for
my
taste
and
i
am
not
putting
it
down
in
any
way
o
3
5
mean
old
tom
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
roasted
aroma
with
nice
hints
of
coffee
and
vanilla
notes
the
taste
is
sweeter
roasted
flavors
are
present
with
generous
hints
of
vanilla
and
nice
subtle
coffee
flavors
nice
full
flavors
and
very
nice
full
body
subtle
but
noticeable
flavors
overall
a
nice
creamy
flavored
stout
o
not
bad
definitely
not
great
if
you
really
like
dry
stouts
you
may
like
this
a
bit
more
i
also
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
hoppy
stouts
and
this
is
leaning
in
that
direction
vanilla
aroma
and
flavor
is
fairly
absent
from
this
beer
sweet
vanilla
kiss
right
off
melds
into
a
warm
chocolate
flavor
with
a
bit
of
char
on
the
back
end
a
touch
of
alcohol
noted
but
it
is
incorporated
well
into
the
beer
adding
a
nice
touch
of
heat
to
it
this
was
a
really
good
beer
glad
i
added
it
to
my
wants
thanks
again
jeff
a
fantastic
stout
im
sure
there
will
be
a
barrel
version
of
this
some
day
right
wow
it
pours
a
midnight
black
color
with
creamy
frothy
thick
off
white
head
with
fantastic
retention
the
nose
is
a
big
stout
to
me
the
vanilla
doesnt
add
much
aromatically
somewhat
surprisingly
big
bitter
barley
malt
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
is
all
the
flavor
is
true
to
style
rich
and
creamy
not
sweet
at
all
more
bitter
than
anything
and
the
vanilla
is
also
subtle
but
natural
its
less
vanilla
intensive
than
some
others
which
is
just
fine
by
me
it
lets
the
malts
really
shine
big
sturdy
mouthfeel
soft
and
dry
full
body
enough
bubbles
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
genre
ive
encountered
for
some
time
a
really
nice
beer
like
they
all
are
from
maine
beer
company
a
well
balanced
stout
that
could
be
a
great
one
with
less
carbonation
and
more
body
definitely
worth
a
buy
or
a
try
o
a
really
good
stout
that
i
could
enjoy
more
than
one
in
a
setting
the
vanilla
isnt
as
potent
as
they
make
it
out
to
be
in
flavor
but
its
a
nice
touch
id
say
its
similar
to
dominions

real

overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
aroma
here
things
were
kept
fresh
well
balanced
inclusive
and
cooling
the
vanilla
came
out
decently
with
a
great
simple
and
heartily
roasty
stout
base
this
translated
well
through
the
flavoring
but
some
of
the
vanilla
brightness
did
get
a
bit
lost
until
the
very
end
of
the
sip
and
aftertaste
where
it
gave
sourness
and
eventual
cleanliness
respectively
the
feel
was
silky
smooth
and
creamy
aiding
drinkability
the
current
trend
is
that
people
are
loving
all
over
maine
beer
companys
more
hoppy
stock
but
we
think
it
is
these
sleepers
that
you
need
to
watch
out
for
pours
almost
black
thick
looking
with
a
khaki
head
of
tight
foam
that
shrank
slowly
to
a

that
kept
coming

some
and
i

some

some

finishes
semi
wet
and
a
little
ashy
the
hops
were
in
there
i
can
tell
by
the
underlying
fruit
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
slick
oil
that
lightly
coats
the
tongue
bitterness
is
very
light
considering
all
that
roasted
toasted
and
burnt
this
is
a
hearty
and
favorable
stout
that
is
not
too
complex
and
has
a
lot
to
enjoy
t
opens
on
a
nice
coffee
and
roasted

note
theres
just
a
hint
of
acidity
to

its
never
so
strong
that
it
becomes
unpleasant
vanilla

chocolate
and
some
charred

intermingle
fantastically
in
the
middle
finish
brings
some
light

dark

nothing
about
this
beer
feels
forced
the
vanilla
is
very
subtle
but
adds
a
lot
of
depth
to
the
flavor
profile
not
the
craziest
stout
out
there
but
this
is
a
keeper
o
this
is
a
solid
wellbalanced
stout
this
beer
isnt
charting
new
territory
but
it
succeeds
in
being
a
great
stout
where
many
others
fall
short
appreciate
it
for
what
is
a
stout
no
barrelaging
no
crazy
flavors
this
is
definitely
a
goto
stout
when
i
want
a
classic
example
of
the
style
well
done
maine
beer
company
overall
thick
robust
slightly
bitter
desserty
brew
pairs
great
with
tiramisu
would
definitely
recommend
oa
nice
stout
with
good
body
and
a
decent
flavor
profile
with
excellent
aftertaste
lingering
mf
some
creaminess
sharp

served

cold

black

with
undertones
of
roasted

and
some
dark
chocolate
drinks
very
smooth
vanilla
dark
chocolate
and
a
light
coffee
flavor
dance
around
ignoring
the
light
hop
bitterness
that
sits
on
the
side
like
a
5th
grader
at
his
first
middle
school
dance
full
bodied
but
still
easy
to
put
down
alcohol
makes
an
appearance
in
aroma
na
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
but
remains
subtle
its
only

i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
overall
a
good
stout
not
the
best
but
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
id
have
another
taste
steps
it
up
a
notch
with
a
nice
clean
drinkable
stout
with
a
moderate
compliment
of
vanilla
beans
i
wouldnt
mind
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
go
with
the
beans
but
i
think
mbc
was
going
for
an
easy
drinking
balanced
beer
here
mission
accomplished
vanilla
additions
are
nice
and
would
make
a
really
nice
cask
ale
to
have
a
pint
or
two
locally
but
it
just
leaves
me
wanting
a
little
more
richness
sweetness
and
surprisingly
chocolate
to
compliment
the
vanilla
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
i
wish
it
offered
a
stronger
nose
and
that
there
was
a
bit
more
vanilla
in
the
taste
it
is
very
understated
to
the
point
you
actively
have
to
look
for
it
that
being
said
id
definitely
drink
it
again
o
ive
heard
great
things
about
maine
beer
co
and
this
is
my
first
of
their
offerings
i
may
have
built
it
up
too
much
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wont
actively
seek
it
out
o
overall
a
well
crafted
stout
the
mouth
feel
is
amazing
and
the
taste
is
delicous
o
a
solid
american
stout
and
the
vanilla
while
not
strong
does
add
a
nice
touch
a
little
pricy
for
frequent
consumption
but
worth
trying
on
occasion
od
a
nice
stout
my
frist
from
maine
brewing
and
i
was
slightly
underwhelmed
based
on
their
hype
complex
and
tasty
nonetheless
quite
rich
but
needed
some
more
vanilla
o
pretty
drinkable
they
managed
to
hit
a
good
level
of
vanilla
without
overdoing
it
and
to
integrate
it
well
with
the
base
beer
that
being
said
the
vanilla
can
be
a
bit
fatiguing
in
moderate
quantities
o
certainly
pleased
to
have
tried
this
brew
but
probably
wouldnt
have
it
again
perhaps
i
just
like
my
stouts
bigger
and
fuller
but
the
taste
wasnt
quite
right
here
either
may
just
be
personal
taste
though
overall
good
stout
not
remarkable
but
solid
and
enjoyable
worth
the
cost
my
wife
thoroughly
enjoyed
and
she
is
more
of
a
stout
drinker
than
i
d
this
was
a
great
stout
i
didnt
pick
up
as
much
vanilla
character
as
i
hoped
but
the
scent
and
taste
were
both
still
very
enjoyable
the
body
was
great
seeming
more
like
a
double
stout
the
finish
was
incredibly
smooth
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
doesnt
need
age
but
who
knows
what
cellaring
may
accomplish
great
refined
brew
recommended
i
think
the
rating
suffer
from
people
looking
at
this
to
fit
a
doubleimperial
stout
profile
its
not
a
double
people
good
to
see
that
mbc
can
do
nonhoppy
beers
this
is
one
is
understated
and
elegant
pours
nearly
jet
black
except
for
a
tinge
of
ruby
when
held
right
up
to
the
lighta
creamy
beige
head
atop
that
left
a
broken
ring
of
lace
behind
vanilla
and
more
vanilla
in
the
nosesome
dark
roast
comes
into
play
as
well
as
some
chocolate
but
the
vanilla
wins
out
its
roasted
on
the
palate
but
i
love
the
vanilla
warming
flavorsits
not
overly
sweet
with
a
nice
somewhat
drying
earthy
finish
this
beer
is
underrated
in
my
opinionits
warming
with
a
nice
vanilla
flavor
that
isnt
overly
donea
great
beer
blackish
brown
with
a
thick
and
frothy
head
that
rises
up
a
full
inch
and
then
settles
out
to
a
low
cap
with
legs
and
ringlets
rising
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
rich
aroma
of
darkly
roasted
malt
and
subtle
vanilla
rich
flavor
of
roasty
malt
somewhat
smokey
bitter
malt
cocoa

some

bitterness
subtle
hop

subtle

a

really

beer
o
quite
good
the
carbonation
conflicts
with
the
favor
profile
a
bit
but
overall
pretty
unique
and
very
enjoyable
this
is
definitely
a
solid
beer
and
it
is
well
crafted
which
is
what
makes
it
exceptional
cheers
o
very
good
drinks
more
like
a
vanilla
porter
than
an
american
stout
but
no
matter
what
you
call
it
its
good
light
to
medium
body
o
perhaps
it
was
my
inclination
to
stack
this
up
against
double
and
imperial
stouts
but
that
is
not
what
this
beer
is
its
a
relatively
moderate
abv
stout
with
a
solid
coffee
and
vanilla
flavor
its
tasty
and
enjoyable
but
not
exactly
world
class
once
again
i
feel
conflicted
on
the
price
tag
of
an
mbc
beer
o
other
great
beer
from
mbc
no
surprise
there
really
tasty
vanilla
stout
the
vanilla
isnt
subtle
its
definitely
here
and
a
big
component
of
this
brew
nice
chocolate
notes
too
ive
got
one
more
bottle
that
ill
sit
on
for
a
couple
of
months
to
let
the
hops
fade
out
a
bit
which
i
think
would
help
o
heck
id
pay
78
buck
for
this
again
maine
never
disappoints
welcome
to
dc
d
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
wouldnt
have
hated
for
more
of
the
vanilla
bean
aspect
to
come
across
on
the
nosepalate
however
still
a
good
american
stout
overall
once
again
maine
brewing
has
done
it
another
excellent
brew
that
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
beer
it
had
an
inch
of
thick
brown
fluffy
head
the
smell
was
pretty
mesmerizing
too
very
roasty
and
chocolatey
the
taste
was
almost
disappointing
after
that
its
good
maybe
even
very
good
but
not
mesmerizing
the
chocolatey
and
coffee
notes
hit
you
first
but
as
your
palate
adjusts
to
their
bitterness
its
a
pretty
straightforward
stout
its
a
very
thick
one
with
a
lot
of
bitter
notes
the
roasted
malt
the
chocolate
bitterness
and
the
cold
coffee
ground
flavours
all
come
together
in
a
nice
way
and
maybe
the
vanilla
bean
flavour
helps
to
mellow
those
out
a
bit
but
i
sort
of
wish
it
did
more
to
that
end
breckenridges
vanilla
porter
may
be
catering
to
a
different
crowd
with
its
sweetness
but
i
thought
it
did
a
much
better
job
of
making
the
vanilla
bean
flavour
a
key
part
of
the
beer
at
least
this
one
just
screams
of
cold
coffee
flavour
its
still
a
decent
stout
though
it
too
is
partakable
be
prepared
for
a
bitter
more
traditional
american
stout
though
there
is
no
sweetness
here
i
was
wondering
how
something
aged
on
vanilla
beans
could
be
mean
but
now
i
know
tom
was
indeed
a
rascal

this

from

again
if
the

was

not
a

thing
though

with

coffee
taste
is
the
opposite
roast
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
forward
with
sweetness
underneath
as
a

not

the
coffee
has
a
definite
roasted
note
not
burnt
beautiful
balance
one
of
the
smoothest
stouts
ive
had
very
good
beer
enjoyed
enough
to
bring
home
growler
of
it
great
aroma
great
taste
definitely
a
nice
dessert
beer
or
winter
warmer
not
as
creamy
or
heavy
as
expected
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
good
thing
to
some
what
else
to
expect
from
kuhnhenn
im
not
normally
huge
on
stoutsporters
but
this
pretty
much
blew
my
mind
bold
flavor
awesome
aroma
easy
drinking
what
a
beer
overall
smells
and
tastes
quite
nice
until
that
roasted
bitterness
takes
over
o
great
beer
i
may
be
biased
because
im
partial
to
kuhnhenn
beers
and
im
also
partial
to
coffee
stouts
but
this
was
just
an
awesome
wellblended
flavorful
stout
best
nose
of
any
beer
ive
ever
had
and
the
taste
doesnt
disappoint
either
not
too
much
coffee
not
too
much
vanilla
not
too
sweet
and
it
actually
still
tastes
like
beer
unlike
the
southern
tier
creme
brulee
if
i
was
left
with
only
one
beer
i
could
drink
for
the
rest
of
my
life
it
would
be
this
one
cost
28
for
a
64
oz
growler
oa
decent
creme
brulee
stout
but
not
quite
as
flavorful
or
comparable
in
body
to
others
ie
southern
tier
m
light
to
medium
bodied
more
porter
than
stout
drink
this
one
was
worthy
the
hype
that
i
put
in
my
head
it
was
creamy
smooth
rich
lush
and
full
of
that
vanilla
caramel
chocolate
note
i
might
finish
a
growler
in
one
night
and
i
am
okay
with
that
o
a
decent
beer
but
not
sure
its
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
try
overall
not
too
sweet
but
really
tasty
the
coffee
is
smooth
and
complimented
well
by
the
other
flavors
i
would
have
this
again
would
love
to
try
this
again
sometime
thanks
again
not
about
destroying
your
mouth
but
what
is
there
is
really
well
pit
together
overall
it
was
pretty
tasty
it
did
however
almost
become
unbearably
sweet
by
the
end
one
10
oz
pour
was
plenty
for
me
o
i
think
the
burnt
sugar
made
this
less
enjoyable
d
this
is
very
hard
to
drink
the
smell
is
not
good
and
the
flavor
is
just
awful
i
had
to
choke
down
my
glass
of
this
and
barely
made
it
through
i
would
recommend
steering
clear
of
this
one
overall
this
was
very
good
although
it
became
a
little
bit
sweet
as
the
glass
progressed
overall
a
tasty
beer
wish
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
looks
and
smells
growler
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
dark
forboding
black
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
very
very
coffee
and
vanilla
in
the
nose
one
of
the
most
decadent
aromas
outside
of
southern
tier
ive
had
in
a
long
time
medium
mouthfeel
the
java
coffee
flavor
domintes
the
start
to
this
but
after
a
second
a
nice
sweet
vanilla
note
joins
the
flavors
and
pairs
nicely
with
the
coffee
slightly
roasty
and
dry
finish
some
chocolate
notes
as
well
overall
pretty
good
d
a
great
flavoured
sweet
stout
they
managed
to
perfectly
balance
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
in
this
one
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
quite
a
bit
of
haze
singlefinger
offwhite
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
is
quite
nice
with
a
lot
of
cream
and
vanilla
plus
a
good
deal
of
coffee
some
roasted
malt
lingering
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
a
bit
too
cloying
as
the
vanilla
and
cream
start
to
take
over
a
bit
still
nice
flavors
lingering
in
the
background
and
i
like
the
addition
of
the
coffee
which
makes
this
much
much
more
drinkable
than
southern
tiers
creme
brulee
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
and
the
sweetness
works
here
i
like
this
version
better
than
the
imperial
terrific
brewed
coffee
aroma
and
very
nice
appearance
the
rest
of
the
experience
is
average
there
is
vanilla
some
woodiness
but
surprisingly
sour
a
fresh
newly
bottled
beer
thanks
to
tim
ipfreely
for
sharing
much
better
in
the
imperial
version
drinkability
moderate
at
best
despite
the
amazing
flavors
that
ive
been
raving
about
throughout
this
whole
review
the
weight
starts
to
sit
a
little
heavy
after
a
bit
and
the
sweetness
would
become
a
bit
much
after
a
while
so
while
its
awesome
here
in
a
snifter
i
dont
think
id
want
it
too
much
as
it
could
get
to
the
point
where
it
actually
turns
the
stomach
well
i
appreciate
the
chance
to
try
this
from
a
generous
trader
but
i
must
sadly
admit
it
is
one
of
the
worst
tasting
beers
i
have
ever
had
dwonderful
at
only
5
8
this
brew
has
all
of
the
flavour
you
could
want
simply
outstanding
very
nice
head
and
dark
almost
black
smelled
like
coffee
and
candy
tasted
like
something
you
could
sink
your
teeth
into
the
carmelized
sugar
gave
it
this
great
desert
taste
with
a
knockout
coffee
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
i
would
drink
this
day
after
day
after
day
my
brother
doesnt
drink
anything
thats
not
candy
and
i
think
that
he
would
even
jump
for
this
beer
this
is
what
i
call
a
desert
beer
overall
ashleys
has
had
southern
tiers
creme
brulee
stout
on
tap
for
the
last
couple
of
weeks
and
let
me
tell
you
i
dented
that
keg
quite
nicely
but
the
kuhnhenn
version
blows
the
st
out
of
the
water
imo
i
like
the
st
because
of
its
high
abv
but
the
kuhnhenn
just
tastes
that
much
better
a
lot
of
coffee
and
a
lot
of
cocoa
not
as
rich
as
st
sorry
southern
tier
kuhnhenn
beats
you
out
here
pitch
black
with
a
billowing
fluffy
head
smell
is
coffee
beans
with
very
strong
hints
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
like
washing
down
a
spoonful
of
brownie
batter
with
a
cup
of
a
fresh
gourmet
coffee
full
bodied
and
extremely
inviting
and
drinkable
this
is
one
that
i
will
have
to
seek
out
again
and
rereview
the
proper
way
note
at
the
michigan
craft
brewers
guild
summer
fest
kuhnhenn
poured
this
in
slushee
form
in
their
brain
freeze
edition
beers
still
very
good
smell
and
taste
are
semisweet
dark
chocolate
fairly
bitter
for
being
such
a
strong
chocolate
flavored
beer
virtually
no
alcohol
presence
and
extremely
drinkable
not
much
in
terms
of
hops
or
heavy
malt
flavor
but
a
lot
of
dark
rich
chocolate
pours
a
very
dark
brown
in
color
a
nice
tan
colored
head
forms
and
sits
on
top
of
the
beer
smell
is
creme
vanilla
and
some
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
a
wonderful
balance
of
vanilla
creme
chocolate
and
roasted
espresso
this
beer
is
everything
that
i
was
wanting
much
different
than
the
southern
tier
version
this
beer
is
much
more
approachable
and
drinkable
very
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
contrary
to
what
i
was
expecting
i
could
actually
see
myself
drinking
a
few
glasses
of
this
before
tiring
of
it
thought
i
would
get
tired
of
the
flavors
but
its
just
so
damn
enjoyable
and
good
very
good
beer
overall
a
solid
beer
and
unlike
many
i
have
ever
tasted
really
unique
flavors
and
complex
on
many
levels
thanks
again
russ
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
beer
kuhnhenns
creme
brulee
pours
jet
black
with
a
thin
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
for
long
or
leave
anything
in
its
wake
thats
fine
cos
the
beer
is
the
bomb
on
the
nose
excellent
this
is
what
southern
tier
should
have
done
brilliant
vanilla
butterscotch
and
chocolate
but
to
keep
things
from
getting
cloying
theres
some
coffee
and
a
gorgeous
roasted
character
both
of
which
along
with
the
chocolate
lend
a
balancing
bitterness
to
the
beer
on
the
palate
this
beer
opens
up
with
the
same
flavors
moderate
vanilla
some
butterscotch
caramel
chocolate
and
coffee
the
roasted
bitterness
provides
the
necessary
backbone
for
this
beer
the
mf
is
great
too
mediumlight
in
body
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
great
sweetbitter
finish
i
drank
about
20oz
and
could
have
gone
for
more
dthis
is
a
great
beer
overall
and
definitely
trumps
southern
tiers
offering
wonderful
sweet
rich
and
creamy
it
almost
becomes
cloying
after
12
a
growler
but
it
takes
much
much
longer
than
sts
offering
to
reach
this
point
about
3
oz
great
beer
overall
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
brewery
a
great
desert
beer
if
i
lived
in
the
area
i
would
defiantly
use
this
brew
to
close
out
a
great
dinner
with
friends
this
brew
is
very
unique
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
doesnt
mind
a
little
sweetness
in
their
brews
thanks
to
the
ugly
duckling
for
making
me
this
way
p
pours
an
almost
complete
black
with
a
monster
three
finger
brownish
chunky
head
that
takes
a
while
to
subside
to
a
thin
layer
which
lasts
throughout
a
fair
amount
of
stick
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
here
and
there
smell
is
just
sublime
vanilla
toffee
egg
nog
caramel
and
bittersweet
chocolate
a
good
amount
of
smokey
malts
and
coffee
beans
as
well
just
a
delight
to
stick
your
nose
down
into
taste
starts
off
with
a
big
explosion
of
sugary
coffee
with
lactose
and
butterscotch
midway
some
slightly
burnt
toast
flavors
and
dark
chocolate
emerge
on
the
tongue
the
finish
is
nutty
and
sweet
with
a
toffee
glazed
almond
taste
body
is
somewhat
thin
but
still
creamy
and
soft
carbonation
is
light
in
the
mouth
but
enjoyable
another
one
of
those
i
want
to
take
this
to
work
beers
i
cant
find
a
touch
of
alcohol
anywhere
making
this
way
too
easy
to
put
down
this
is
a
zillion
times
better
than
southern
tiers
creme
brulee
because
its
actually
drinkable
why
they
have
the
same
b
score
is
beyond
me
excellent
beer
for
sure
kudos
to
kuhnhenn
drinkability
ridiculous
can
a
beer
be
too
drinkable
no
but
this
one
is
close
mouthfeel
is
sweet
roasty
bitter
and
light
bodied
loads
of
flavor
excellent
notes
from
112205
d
its
a
nice
sipper
that
id
really
like
to
try
again
i
had
the
first
glass
out
of
the
firkin
at
the
ba
gathering
at
hopcat
in
grand
rapids
2
months
ago
it
was
amazing
it
was
black
with
a
very
dirty
brown
head
with
a
light
milky
hint
the
smell
was
very
rich
and
well
balanced
a
very
good
foreshadowing
of
the
flavor
there
was
not
a
lot
of
mouth
feel
witch
i
thought
fit
this
very
flavorful
beer
the
mocha
and
cream
flavors
were
very
well
balanced
not
overpowering
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
go
well
after
a
big
italian
dinner
or
maybe
in
the
morning
to
help
nurse
a
hangover
over
all
excellent
beer
d
highly
drinkable
even
with
the
relatively
complex
flavor
structure
the
beer
is
in
many
ways
still
refreshing
d
pretty
high
if
you
like
sweet
coffee
this
would
be
good
for
breakfast
methinks
balance
well
done
im
also
impressed
with
how
well
the
sweetness
was
kept
at
bay
is
this
beer
really
or
is
is
dessert
while
i
would
have
like
to
have
seen
the
coffee
character
shine
a
little
more
beneath
all
that
sweetness
i
cant
really
argue
that
this
is
one
hugely
tasty
and
quaffable
concoction
poured
into
a
pint
glass
very
dark
black
thick
tan
head
forms
tons
of
lacing
on
the
glass
very
good
retention
nice
ring
smell
is
awesome
insanely
rich
mocha
chocolate
toffee
coffee
grinds
bread
nice
malts
caramelized
great
taste
is
similar
rich
coffee
roast
chocolate
toffee
actually
tastes
like
creme
brulee
caramelized
sugars
and
a
cup
of
coffee
amazing
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
smooth
and
drinkable
a
fantastic
stout
d
tasty
and
definitely
a
unique
beer
the
lower
alcohol
is
great
and
ill
finish
nearly
the
entire
growler
tonight
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
literally
simply
amazing
d
doesnt
get
any
better
than
this
poured
a
deep
black
with
a
touch
of
deep
reddishbrown
hues
thin
coffee
tan
head
had
little
retention
and
left
some
lacing
smells
like
dessert
lots
of
vanilla
brown
sugar
caramel
coffee
and
cream
definitely
sweet
tastes
of
sweet
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
cappuccino
with
a
roasted
coffee
bitter
finish
medium
body
smooth
and
creamy
really
sweet
and
vanillay
with
a
subtle
bitterness
in
the
finish
easy
to
drink
low
in
alcohol
making
it
really
sessionable
if
you
like
sweet
coffee
flavored
beers
this
could
be
a
nice
dessert
beer
or
a
good
way
to
start
off
the
day
growler
generously
shared
by
tyee
thanks
the
bottom
line
i
love
coffee
and
i
love
beer
i
think
most
of
the
coffee
brews
that
are
put
out
end
up
unbalanced
in
some
way
or
unsatisfying
kuhnhenn
have
put
together
my
ideal
java
brew
here
strong
coffee
but
balanced
a
unique
sweet
vanilla
finish
really
great
stuff
id
definitely
order
it
again
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
an
after
dinner
drink
but
this
certainly
isnt
something
id
drink
everyday
or
more
than
one
of
at
a
time
the
flavors
are
very
strong
not
in
a
bad
way
but
they
still
hinder
the
drink
ability
of
this
ive
had
better
stouts
but
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
if
i
ever
find
it
again
d
very
enjoyable
d
why
dont
i
live
in
michigan
a
definite
good
beer
that
id
like
to
try
on
draft
or
in
the
bottle
omg
absolutely
delicious
probably
the
best
stout
that
i
have
tasted
a
well
balanced
beer
with
tons
of
malt
and
a
subtle
sweetness
it
smells
sweeter
than
it
tastes
if
you
get
the
chance
stop
by
the
brew
pub
and
try
a
glass
or
two
can
i
say
heaven
in
a
bottle
the
appearance
was
pretty
good
nearly
opaque
brown
color
with
a
wetlooking
but
none
too
clingytoglass
head
the
aroma
was
very
sweet
vanilla
and
cocoa
and
maybe
a
touch
of
smoke
the
flavor
was
intensely
sweet
almost
tasted
like
a
syrup
was
added
to
the
beer
or
something
decent
enough
mouthfeel
but
the
bitingly
sweet
taste
was
too
much
for
me
enjoyed
at
the
brewpub
this
beer
was
almost
completely
black
with
just
a
faint
chestnut
tint
at
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
dark
tan
head
left
some
chunky
lacing
and
the
foam
showed
good
retention
the
aroma
was
overwhelmingly
vanilla
with
a
fair
bit
of
roast
almost
coffee
and
milk
chocolate
as
well
mild
bitterness
definitely
balanced
towards
sweetness
this
brew
is
malty
full
of
chocolate
and
roasty
notes
theres
still
a
lot
of
vanilla
in
here
full
bodied
low
carbonation
and
silky
smooth
this
stuff
is
good
but
really
intense
i
imagine
it
would
go
great
with
a
lot
of
desserts
shouldnt
this
be
a
double
stout
this
was
beer
4
of
4
last
night
the
most
disappointing
of
the
four
last
summer
at
the
world
beer
expo
this
was
the
hit
of
the
festival
for
me
but
since
i
only
had
a
taste
i
didnt
want
to
review
it
until
i
had
an
entire
glass
i
must
have
had
it
built
up
so
much
in
my
head
that
this
was
bound
disappoint
brought
to
me
in
a
pint
glass
out
of
a
nitro
pour
the
appearance
is
nice
thin
tan
head
over
deep
mahogany
dark
brown
smells
like
vanilla
cakefrostingcake
batter
burnt
sugar
roasted
malt
aside
from
the
malt
it
smells
like
a
creme
brule
taste
is
vanilla
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
some
bitter
espresso
malt
but
then
theres
a
bizarre
sour
flavor
that
hits
like
cheap
coffee
very
odd
the
mouthfeel
was
very
watery
this
needs
to
be
creamier
with
all
of
this
taken
into
consideration
this
is
not
very
drinkable
it
was
actually
difficult
to
finish
hopefully
it
was
just
a
bad
batch
not
recommended
drinkability
i
am
wowed
by
the
flavor
here
much
less
cloying
than
southern
tier
yet
still
a
bit
sweet
to
drink
in
quantity
12

label
many
thanks
to
hoppdeup
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
at
the
quiet
bar
on
saturday
afternoon
despite
the
fact
that
i
am
not
a
stout
drinker
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
be
glad
to
have
another
pint
given
the
opportunity
taste
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
this
is
the
antithesis
of
smooth
and
tastes
like
a
cold
cup
of
coffee
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
not
very
smooth
a
drainpour
for
me
very
dark
in
color
not
a
lot
of
head
to
speak
of
fantastic
aromachocolatey
and
vanilla
mixjust
a
great
blend
of
smellstruely
dessert
in
a
glass
great
roasted
flavor
with
a
full
though
mellow
coffee
flavor
behind
it
all
pefect
blend
of
the
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
with
a
creamy
vanilla
mix
in
there
great
bodysomewhat
thin
for
all
that
flavor
a
fantastic
beer
overall
incredible
stuff
methinks
i
shall
d
enticing
but
not
very
sessionable
took
that
one
at
the
mondial
2006
a
nice
dark
black
body
with
a
dark
brown
thin
head
who
disappear
quickly
it
really
smells
like
a
cola
soft
drink
with
a
hint
of
peppermint
strange
and
some
roasted
coffee
flavor
of
sour
berries
black
tea
and
chocolate
mint
i
didnt
really
liked
it
in
fact
i
think
that
one
was
infected
but
maybe
that
was
the
real
taste
of
it
for
sure
i
wont
try
it
again
for
a
while
it
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
while
i
wouldnt
want
to
do
sessions
of
it
id
have
no
problem
having
a
pint
or
two
in
a
sitting
definitely
a
must
try
the
worst
stout
ive
ever
encountered
id
like
to
try
it
fresh
since
this
bottle
was
a
year
old
another
great
brew
from
kuhnhenns
i
cant
wait
for
my
next
trip
to
michigan
i
could
sit
and
smell
this
one
all
day
but
its
all
i
can
do
to
finish
the
bottle
this
is
a
february
2005
bottle
almost
10
months
later
and
judging
from
the
reviews
it
is
way
past
its
prime
too
bad
because
it
looked
great
dark
with
solid
black
coffee
with
sugar
sweetness
the
taste
was
like
a
beer
cocktail
combining
a
coffee
stout
with
a
sour
lambic
some
may
like
this
blend
but
sad
to
say
that
i
had
to
dump
it
it
didnt
make
me
gag
but
the
taste
and
smell
do
not
work
together
thanks
to
mjohn27603
for
throwing
this
in
a
recent
trade
i
think
this
is
the
definitive
review
on
this
beer
my
friend
brought
me
some
fresh
from
the
brewery
on
a
visit
out
east
delaware
in
august
2005
amazing
the
coffee
chocolate
burnt
caramel
creme
brulee
flavors
were
there
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
the
taste
and
the
beer
was
awesome
i
set
3
aside
to
see
what
age
would
do
the
results
were
not
good
the
beer
took
on
a
vinous
sour
taste
after
2
months
and
by
4
months
it
was
undrinkable
poured
2
bottles
out
after
sampling
definitely
this
beer
is
to
be
consumed
as
soon
as
posible
and
should
not
be
put
down
for
future
consideration
unless
you
mean
to
put
it
down
by
shooting
it
like
old
yellr
sob
sob
i
cant
speak
to
the
rest
of
their
beers
durability
cuz
they
didnt
survive
the
weekend
they
arrived
at
my
house
they
brew
very
good
beers
just
dont
wait
to
drink
them
drinkability
the
aroma
alone
is
worth
cracking
one
open
but
dont
get
the
taste
buds
overly
excited
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
14
light
brown
head
above
the
opaque
dark
brownblack
brew
head
fades
slowly
to
a
continuous
film
of
small
bubbles
with
nice
lacing
aroma
is
coffee
with
a
slight
sour
fruity
tinge
to
it
uh
oh
taste
is
actually
reasonably
well
balanced
between
coffee
and
fruity
cherry
tartness
sort
a
light
lambic
thing
going
on
mouthfeel
is
average
maybe
a
bit
above
with
smoothness
overcoming
the
sourness
a
bit
and
drinkability
is
okay
just
have
trouble
believing
this
brew
is
supposed
to
be
like
this
and
i
would
think
a
stout
would
last
in
good
storage
for
longer
than
the
prescribed
4
months
oh
well
this
brew
was
very
drinkable
however
i
could
go
for
a
sixpack
every
now
and
again
were
it
available
around
here
the
creme
brulee
java
stout
looks
and
smells
pretty
typical
for
the
style
thick
and
black
brown
head
a
dayold
coffee
grounds
smell
but
the
taste
is
literally
the
worst
i
have
ever
encountered
in
a
beer
there
are
undertones
of
flavors
mirroring
the
smell
but
the
only
thing
youre
going
to
notice
is
the
sournessits
like
a
goddamn
warhead
only
it
never
wears
off
i
could
only
manage
a
few
sips
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
but
even
if
you
took
away
the
pucker
itd
only
be
an
average
coffee
stout
with
it
however
it
is
undrinkable
drinkability
and
notes

an
unexpectedly
bad
beer
that
i
could
not
finish
hopefully
i
will
get
another
at
some
point
so
that
i
can
see
if
this
sourness
is
as
prevalent
in
a
fresh
sample
while
this
was
my
only
bottle
of
kuhnhenn
i
did
visit
the
brewpub
and
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
sweet
some
bitterness
comes
through
in
the
form
of
roast
coffee
and
then
it
goes
sweet
again
plenty
of
milk
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
medium
full
bodied
very
gentle
carbonation
too
damn
sweet
fairly
drinkable
there
is
so
much
coffee
you
could
probably
substitute
this
at
a
nice
session
with
friends
ill
need
to
get
another
bottle
or
more
to
determine
the
infected
theory
still
seemed
ok
to
me
in
a
way
but
the
weird
sour
tone
conjured
up
a
bad
vibe
on
this
one
sorry
tim
i
think
ill
need
some
more
rather
light
in
the
mouth
but
it
could
be
a
decent
session
brew
it
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
ring
of
head
over
top
the
nose
is
really
nice
almost
like
an
iced
french
vanilla
coffee
milkshake
it
smells
really
damn
good
the
flavor
is
not
good
its
almost
sour
none
of
the
great
full
flavor
of
chocolate
and
coffee
i
expect
bleh
not
right
the
feel
is
light
and
lacking
the
creamy
thickness
that
i
want
this
beer
is
like
that
hot
girl
i
dated
in
high
school
that
told
me
she
wouldnt
put
out
till
marriage
it
teases
me
with
a
voluptuous
and
complex
aroma
only
to
leave
me
blueballed
with
the
flavor
feel
and
drinkability
i
just
dont
dig
it
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
divine
tons
of
chocolate
mocha
buttery
coffee
diacetyl
marshmallows
smells
like
really
good
french
vanilla
coffee
the
flavor
is
a
huge
let
down
has
a
strong
sour
thing
going
on
that
i
dont
care
for
there
is
a
slight
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
but
the
sour
is
really
in
the
majority
of
the
flavor
profile
body
is
moderate
at
best
drinkability
isnt
very
good
the
flavor
is
such
a
huge
letdown
from
the
aroma
other
no
aftertaste
save
a
slight
generic
kahlua
leftover
raspberry
eisbock
somewhat
overhyped
but
great
this
beer
is
a
total
failure
in
all
respects
and
similar
reviews
show
i
didnt
have
a
bad
bottle
i
just
wont
be
accepting
of
a
beer
this
off
with
an
average
score
i
hope
my
4th
dementia
bottle
is
better
and
worth
what
i
gave
up
in
the
trade
same
as
above
but
i
have
found
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
the
flavor
is
much
more
intense
and
enjoyable
taste
went
from
2
5
to
3
5
just
my
findings
cheers
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
thick
and
chewy
definitely
a
sipping
beer
because
the
beer
is
so
overwhelming
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
this
is
a
unique
brew
but
one
that
i
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
overall
i
find
it
amazing
that
these
flavors
can
even
exist
in
a
beer
let
alone
in
such
a
way
that
is
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
only
suffers
from
my
point
of
view
because
this
is
a
desert
beer
and
i
personally
cant
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
well
done
k
bros
pours
out
to
a
nearly
opaque
very
dark
brown
forming
a
small
tan
head
despite
a
vigorous
pour
poor
retention
and
absent
lacing
carbonation
is
mild
the
aroma
is
predominated
by
black
coffee
a
ton
of
vanilla
caramelized
and
burnt
sugar
and
deeply
roasted
grains
very
nice
aroma
medium
thin
body
and
stinging
mouthfeel
hrmmm
the
taste
is
odd
its
sour
and
i
think
i
better
gobble
this
up
before
it
gets
any
more
sour
as
its
barely
tolerable
now
perhaps
its
just
a
bad
bottle
not
sweet
at
all
and
not
stoutish
at
all
this
reminds
me
of
the
reaper
ale
with
the
wierd
sourness
ill
have
to
revisit
this
as
this
must
be
a
bad
batch
see
jetsbeer
review
which
was
also
feb
2005
for
now
ill
call
it
as
i
see
it
its
nearly
black
without
much
head
it
smells
like
chocolate
milk
perhaps
with
subtle
smoke
and
coffee
notes
it
tastes
like
chocolate
milk
but
with
a
bit
of
a
tangy
whitewiney
snap
at
the
end
there
is
also
a
finetextured
effervescence
not
bad
at
all
aroma
is
of
coffee
with
some
sweetness
had
on
nitro
tap
taste
is
great
it
seems
like
i
am
drinking
custard
the
carmelized
sugar
is
definitely
present
without
being
overwhelming
this
might
taste
good
with
some
orange
flavor
too
ive
never
quite
drank
anything
like
this
before
quite
a
unique
combination
the
stout
works
beautifully
with
the
coffee
and
carmelized
sugars
sweetness
with
roasted
notes
it
takes
you
on
an
interesting
taste
journey
through
the
glass
have
when
fresh
a
repeat
visit
some
weeks
later
would
cause
me
lower
my
ratings
by
0
5
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
solid
efforts
by
kuhnhenn
very
smooth
mouthfeel
i
also
tried
the
bottled
version
and
it
didnt
have
the
mouthfeel
or
the
carmelized
sugars
in
great
presence
this
is
why
we
bas
try
new
beers
crème
brulee
pours
virtually
black
with
just
ever
so
subtle
highlights
of
deep
mahogany
around
the
edges
its
topped
by
a
toffee
colored
head
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
sweet
hot
chocolate
with
vanilla
and
caramel
notes
mixed
in
with
the
coffee
and
chocolate
the
flavor
is
absolutely
mind
blowing
heavy
cream
chocolate
coffee
vanilla
caramel
molasses
and
then
the
hints
of
hops
and
roasted
malt
the
aftertaste
is
cocoa
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
lingers
on
the
tail
end
the
flavor
draws
out
for
a
good
while
and
you
could
really
stretch
a
pint
of
this
beer
very
easy
to
sit
and
savor
but
just
as
easy
to
have
more
than
a
couple
the
mouthfeel
is
just
ultra
creamy
silky
sexy
i
considered
skipping
my
flight
for
this
beer
but
thankfully
they
provided
me
with
a
couple
bottles
for
the
trip
home
this
is
that
beer
that
falls
into
the
top
1
of
beers
you
drink
i
feel
enriched
having
had
the
opportunity
to
experience
it
i
will
pine
for
a
return
trip
to
the
motor
city
and
kuhnhenn
thanks
again
clark
this
kuhnhenn
stout
sure
does
resemble
the
acclaimed
founders
breakfast
stout
it
is
very
dark
brown
and
proposes
a
nice
offwhite
ring
its
aroma
is
an
overwhelming
espresso
medley
not
even
beany
this
wins
big
points
considering
the
vanilla
undertones
i
rarely
encounter
them
without
this
usually
unpleasant
beany
aspect
strong
chocolate
complexities
make
this
a
total
dessert
brew
strongly
carbonated
body
medium
in
size
it
has
pleasant
sweet
and
tart
vanilla
essence
notes
that
match
the
chocolate
in
an
overall
sweet
flavour
profile
that
doesnt
quite
match
the
aroma
but
this
remains
a
surprisingly
good
stout
split
a
bottle
of
this
lovely
beer
the
other
night
i
was
quite
excited
about
having
something
called
creme
brulee
java
stout
sounds
like
heaven
in
a
bottle
it
wasnt
quite
that
but
still
good
the
beer
was
very
dark
brown
reddish
up
to
the
light
with
a
light
brown
fat
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
which
lasts
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
kind
of
got
to
me
it
took
me
a
few
sniffs
before
i
was
ok
with
it
i
thought
it
smelled
like
sweet
sweet
coffee
with
the
slightest
creaminess
some
sourness
and
covered
in
dust
from
some
attic
really
i
got
a
weird
musty
smell
mixed
in
with
the
roasty
desserty
goodness
tasted
better
than
it
smelled
thankfully
there
is
a
highly
acidic
flavour
which
helps
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
and
roastiness
of
the
beer
so
no
one
taste
is
overpowering
i
got
a
dry
almosty
fruity
grapey
aftertaste
not
bad
mouthfeel
was
good
and
creamy
not
too
thick
though
drinkability
for
me
is
not
the
best
i
would
maybe
have
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
ahold
of
a
bottle
mainly
because
the
sour
musty
smell
kept
punching
me
in
the
face
and
not
in
a
real
good
way
the
taste
made
up
for
that
a
bit
but
didnt
cancel
it
out
i
was
glad
for
the
opportunity
to
taste
it
though
dark
black
with
red
ruby
edges
head
is
tan
coloured
in
nature
and
billowy
the
aroma
screams
of
strong
dark
roasted
colombian
coffee
beans
roasted
malts
also
come
into
play
there
is
also
a
slight
hint
of
vanilla
in
the
background
the
taste
is
all
roasted
coffee
bitter
and
acidic
there
is
also
a
sweetness
in
the
background
and
hints
of
vanilla
bean
sugar
and
perhaps
even
the
creme
brulee
that
this
brew
is
named
after
the
mouthfeel
is
light
considering
all
of
the
flavor
that
is
packed
into
this
gem
its
also
acidic
and
a
little
lactic
on
the
tongue
one
can
certainly
tell
that
a
doubleimperial
version
of
this
brew
beefed
up
to
about
10abv
with
a
thickass
mouthfeel
would
be
legendary
hopefully
the
brothers
kuhnhenn
take
note
drinkability
is
good
as
well
but
not
perfect
the
mouthfeel
and
acidic
sweetness
of
this
could
get
annoying
after
a
while
but
if
i
had
a
six
pack
in
front
of
me
it
would
probably
be
gone
by
the
end
of
the
night
another
majestic
creation
from
this
brewery
that
sits
amongst
my
personal
favorites
thanks
to
walleye
for
the
sample
slàinte
not
an
adult
beer
im
not
sure
how
much
of
this
is
natural
and
how
much
is
petroleumbased
flavoring
agent
from
the
tap
at
the
brewery
pored
black
brown
a
nice
size
tan
head
aroma
hazelnut
carameldark
cherries
irish
cream
flavor
same
as
above
wow
this
is
a
greak
java
even
though
this
is
differant
than
bells
java
it
is
far
better
i
just
hope
they
keep
brewing
this
after
having
the
blueberry
that
these
guys
make
this
was
the
coffee
with
my
pancakes
wow
what
a
great
dessert
beer
i
love
the
look
of
the
dark
beers
and
this
one
doesnt
dissapoint
nice
chocolate
mix
with
toffee
creme
head
after
all
the
beers
i
sampled
at
the
world
beer
festival
yesterday
this
was
the
most
unique
the
combination
of
flavors
and
smells
was
off
the
planet
vanilla
coffee
caramel
creme
malty
thick
and
yummy
sweet
but
not
sickly
sweet
i
would
love
to
have
this
with
creme
brule
wow
what
a
beer
what
a
great
chance
to
try
some
of
the
different
brews
from
this
place
yesterday
at
the
world
beer
festthis
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
an
almond
colored
head
awesome
aromas
of
caramel
and
dark
roast
coffee
this
hit
the
nose
and
woke
me
up
taste
couldnt
get
any
better
like
eating
vanillacaramel
ice
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
mouthfeel
was
amazing
like
biting
into
a
marshmellow
cant
think
of
a
better
dessert
beer
i
have
ever
had
thats
for
sure
next
time
i
go
home
i
might
have
to
take
a
trip
down
to
warren
for
this
place
one
of
the
most
unique
and
impressively
creative
beers
ive
ever
tried
nice
coffee
flavor
nice
runofthemill
coffee
brew
very
consistent
great
flavor
tastes
like
a
coffee
frappacino
nice
o
for
the
money
its
decent
but
once
it
warms
this
beer
becomes
near
undrinkable
my
advice
is
to
drink
this
beer
cold
and
considering
its
narragansett
it
isnt
all
that
surprising
could
be
worse
but
could
also
be
a
whole
lot
better
it
was
just
ok
to
me
perfect
combination
of
coffee
and
stout
when
your
done
it
leaves
you
wanting
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
pint
of
beer
narrys
got
a
winner
with
this
sixpack
of
tall
boys
from
wh
abc
an
excellent
beer
for
the
price
more
in
line
with
stone
coffee
milk
stout
light
bodied
is
my
only
complaint
but
10
for
a
6
pack
of
tall
boys
its
a
winner
rich
stout
with
a
bold
coffee
presence
this
beer
has
coffee
in
abundance
finish
is
bitter
good
coffee
kick
first
like
this
ive
had
its
good
this
brewerys
best
offering
by
far
love
it
all
i
can
say
is
wow
this
stout
has
everything
it
should
nice
roastiness
along
with
a
good
bit
of
coffee
flavor
the
milk
stout
feel
was
a
bit
low
possibly
being
a
little
overpowered
by
the
coffee
poured
black
with
a
nice
head
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
lower
alcohol
stout
that
borders
on
great
got
in
a
bif
from
zebracakez
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
bottled
on
9252014
pours
fairly
pitch
black
color
with
a
12
finger
dense
and
rocky
dark
tan
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
small
cap
that
lingers
nice
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
with
a
good
amount
of
streaming
carbonation
retaining
the
head
aromas
of
big
dark
chocolate
cocoa
coffee
toast
cream
light
char
and
roasted
earthiness
very
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
and
complexity
of
darkroasted
malt
and
coffee
notes
with
great
strength
taste
of
dark
chocolate
cocoa
coffee
toast
cream
light
char
and
roasted
earthiness
slight
roasted
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
dark
chocolate
cocoa
coffee
toast
cream
light
char
and
roasted
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
short
bit
good
complexity
and
solid
robustness
of
darkroasted
malt
and
coffee
flavors
with
a
good
roasted
bitternesssweetness
balance
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
dryness
on
the
finish
as
well
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
smooth
fairly
creamy
and
slightly
chalky
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
coffee
milk
stout
all
around
good
complexity
and
solid
robustness
of
darkroasted
malt
and
coffee
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
this
felt
more
like
a
dry
stout
but
was
still
nicely
enjoyable
this
is
an
average
beer
that
drinks
more
like
a
session
brown
ale
than
a
stout
i
like
that
it
is
lower
abv
and
is
easy
drinking
overall
it
is
enjoyable
but
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
i
tend
not
to
love
coffee
in
beer
unless
it
is
a
big
rich
stout
i
really
enjoyed
this
relatively
low
abv
stoutporter
it
compares
well
with
my
favorite
stout
sn
stout
you
get
a
nice
head
on
the
pour
with
decent
lacing
as
the
beer
is
consumed
some
have
mentioned
the
level
of
carbonation
and
it
is
a
bit
higher
than
some
other
stouts
ive
tried
it
does
contribute
to
a
lighter
mouthfeel
i
think
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
thickness
than
a
typical
stout
almost
akin
to
a
porter
the
appearance
of
cola
and
a
coffeish
chocolately
taste
breathes
a
roasted
flavor
of
coffeebeans
ive
found
its
better
to
let
it
age
in
the
can
for
a
couple
months
it
lets
the
carbonation
and
particles
settle
more
delicious
beer
though
comes
with
a
buzz
i
have
to
admit
that
i
was
skeptical
about
this
beer
given
the
narragansett
name
but
it
totally
delivers
its
rich
with
an
authentic
coffee
flavor
as
well
as
chocolate
and
caramel
and
perfectly
balanced
without
any
flavors
covering
over
others
or
eventually
building
to
take
the
lead
a
moderate
bitterness
balances
it
and
it
teeters
between
sweet
and
dry
but
always
with
a
pleasant
roasted
edge
some
might
argue
that
theres
not
enough
body
or
malt
to
it
but
i
feel
that
if
its
got
the
flavor
that
youre
looking
for
thats
enough
its
a
tradeoff
more
body
and
malt
might
be
more
satisfying
but
less
leaves
it
more
drinkable
it
finishes
dry
and
fairly
short
with
some
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
lingering
along
with
some
very
subtle
hops
its
not
complex
but
its
rich
i
cant
fathom
why
anybody
would
rate
this
low
except
that
maybe
the
reviewer
just
doesnt
think
well
of
narraganset
lager
i
dont
like
their
lager
much
at
all
either
but
their
dark
seasonal
beers
have
been
outstanding
o
this
is
as
local
as
it
gets
for
me
and
i
grew
up
with
autocrat
so
im
already
a
fan
but
its
also
just
a
good
beer
in
my
opinion
nothing
crazy
special
but
its
pretty
cheap
and
well
worth
a
spot
in
the
fridge
my
rating
2
95
i
had
this
on
tap
and
was
good
strong
coffee
taste
but
smooth
in
the
can
it
taste
overpowering
with
coffee
and
booze
really
turned
me
off
drank
straight
from
the
can
i
have
averaged
out
the
ratings
based
on
an
overall
score
i
liked
the
flavor
the
coffee
was
fairly
limited
and
it
was
nice
and
smooth
good
body
would
drink
again
o
easy
drinker
coffee
is
solid
but
not
overbearing
if
this
was
local
and
cheap
it
could
be
a
go
to
type
beer
the
coffee
aromas
and
flavors
are
dominant
here
but
the
milk
stout
character
doesnt
quite
come
out
if
were
talking
about
being
true
to
the
coffee
milk
stout
style
it
loses
a
few
points
but
if
we
can
judge
it
as
a
coffee
stout
or
as
a
beer
overall
its
quite
good
overall
not
a
bad
coffee
stout
with
decent
thickness
my
review
is
simple
because
this
beer
pretty
much
boils
down
to
one
word
coffee
it
was
alright
kind
of
one
note
and
it
wasnt
that
good
of
a
note
to
begin
with
nothing
special
about
it
at
all
i
think
id
rather
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
and
then
a
beer
quite
dry
for
a
milk
stout
pours
nearly
opaque
with
a
inchtall
brown
head
smells
lightly
sweet
and
chocolatey
with
a
fine
compliment
of
dry
hops
tastes
like
it
smells
straightforward
mild
coffee
nodes
move
into
a
sweet
and
smooth
middle
ending
on
darkroasted
barley
and
bitter
hops
this
beer
was
great
and
totally
unexpected
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
had
very
thin
no
real
flavor
tasted
like
a
cup
of
coffee
that
had
been
sitting
out
for
a
couple
of
days
on
the
counter
maybe
skip
the
lactose
and
just
call
it
a
dry
coffee
stout
pours
a
dark
brownblack
with
a
brown
head
with
a
good
amount
of
retention
to
the
carbonation
the
smell
is
full
of
coffee
and
espresso
with
some
sweetness
dark
chocolate
scents
coming
through
the
taste
was
full
of
coffee
flavors
with
an
undercurrent
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
very
tasty
and
makes
a
hell
of
an
after
dinner
beer
strong
coffee
scent
and
flavor
not
thick
like
most
stouts
however
certainly
kind
of
one
dimensional
but
i
dig
it
for
the
format
and
price
coffee
feels
fresh
and
flavorful
and
delivers
atop
that
narragansett
yeast
profile
a
smooth
stout
with
a
refreshing
coffee
flavor
taste
starts
with
roasted
dark
grains
tart
lactic
character
in
the
middle
and
then
smooths
back
into
the
close
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
enjoyable
representative
of
the
style
o
despite
losing
some
of
the
more
subtle
flavors
and
aromas
due
to
the
dominant
ones
being
magnified
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
hits
all
of
the
required
nails
right
on
the
head
the
pour
is
beautiful
and
the
finish
leaves
you
wanting
more
this
works
out
well
given
the
moderate
abv
which
lends
this
to
be
a
definite
session
candidate
honestly
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
with
any
of
the
recent
offerings
from
narragansett
and
this
is
no
different
at
8
for
a
six
pack
of
tallboys
it
may
be
the
best
coffee
milk
stout
ive
had
for
the
money
can
pours
dark
brown
with
an
accompanying
dark
brown
head
aroma
is
moderate
coffee
chocolate
and
roast
it
does
not
smell
very
intense
which
is
fine
because
the
actual
smells
are
on
point
the
flavor
was
pleasantly
dry
it
was
not
too
sweet
thankfully
the
coffee
and
roasted
flavor
are
dominant
unsweetened
chocolate
also
works
its
way
im
there
is
some
sweetness
but
it
isnt
an
overly
sugary
beer
body
was
slightly
creamy
but
not
too
heavy
i
enjoyed
this
one
good
beer
this
is
a
revelation
probably
the
best
narragansett
beer
ive
had
much
better
than
the
recent
stone
coffee
milk
stout
a
bit
more
complexity
on
the
finish
and
it
would
be
even
more
amazing
narragansetts
autocrat
coffee
milk
stout
is
an
immensely
flavorful
and
enjoyable
beer
that
pays
homage
to
an
iconic
rhode
island
product
like
dels
shandy
this
is
a
welcomed
edition
to
the
brewerys
portfolio
poured
from
a
can
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
a
creamy
dense
dark
tan
head
that
doesnt
go
anywhere
very
nice
aromas
of
dark
roasted
coffee
subtle
crème
hints
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
earthy
notes
flavors
are
pretty
heavy
roasted
coffee
forward
rich
and
bitter
with
a
highlight
of
cocoa
nibs
subtle
crème
and
a
hint
of
nut
sweetness
smooth
bodied
with
dry
undertones
this
is
an
easy
drinker
the
aftertaste
has
more
of
the
milky
sugar
notes
with
coffee
and
chocolate
still
blending
together
nicely
smooth
slightly
dry
finish
with
a
solid
bitter
and
roasted
linger
this
is
a
well
balanced
solid
brew
o
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
coffee
milk
stout
and
one
that
i
had
to
get
because
of
the
nostalgia
factor
i
lived
in
southern
ne
growing
up
and
drank
more
than
my
fair
share
of
autocrat
coffee
milks
the
coffee
flavor
is
strong
but
still
very
enjoyable
a
very
good
coffee
stout
not
an
imperial
nice
mouthfeel
not
too
heavy
at
all
for
a
stout
id
say
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
for
the
style
but
it
still
has
a
lingering
flavor
great
carbonation
level
tickles
your
taste
buds
yet
its
really
smooth
starts
sweet
stays
smooth
almost
milkycreamy
then
has
a
nice
dry
bitter
finish
crazy
drinkable
all
around
great
beer
regardless
of
style
great
price
too
im
a
huge
stone
brewing
company
fan
but
their
coffee
milk
stout
isnt
as
good
as
this
and
it
costs
more
for
less
beer
nice
job
narragansett
you
nailed
this
one
overall
one
of
gansetts
best
i
think
and
one
that
ill
rereview
when
i
get
to
trying
it
in
an
actual
glass
or
something
i
intend
on
buying
more
of
this
for
the
winter
months
as
it
would
be
a
great
beer
for
the
season
without
being
too
boozy
pours
dark
black
brown
with
a
very
lovely
tan
creamy
head
smells
of
toasted
brown
bread
and
rich
malts
taste
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
hints
of
brown
bread
malts
and
rich
creamy
coffee
and
milk
flavor
this
is
an
awesome
coffee
milk
stout
and
one
i
will
get
an
extra
case
of
this
week
while
it
is
around
i
give
it
a
complete
rating
of
4
5
it
is
awesome
this
is
a
very
good
stout
my
only
knock
is
that
it
really
isnt
a
stout
more
of
a
porter
at
best
great
coffee
flavor
another
well
made
brew
from
narragansett
will
buy
more
for
sure
o
super
drinkable
nose
is
a
little
one
dimension
but
i
loved
the
flavor
profile
cant
beat
the
price
either
overall
as
a
staple
of
ri
coffee
it
is
good
to
see
narragansett
getting
back
to
their
original
state
in
due
time
they
will
get
back
to
ri
in
the
mean
time
we
can
enjoy
more
of
these
delicious
brews
overall
a
decent
beer
an
easy
drinker
of
a
stout
o
certainly
no
fbs
but
still
a
solid
coffee
stout
with
a
nice
lactose
addition
very
drinkable
and
definitely
gets
you
your
roasty
coffee
fix
great
value
at
under
9
for
a
6pack
of
16
oz
cans
a
very
thin
coffee
milk
stout
for
being
a
gannsett
beer
this
is
pretty
darn
good
would
i
buy
this
over
the
stone
coffee
milk
stout
probably
its
cheaper
per
ounce
and
just
as
good
its
probably
slightly
less
flavorful
though
its
a
bargain
well
worth
a
try
if
you
like
narragansetts
other
offerings
o
not
a
stout
i
would
reach
for
but
ok
overall
like
it
a
lot
and
a
super
bargain
at
the
price
have
paid
a
lot
more
and
gotten
less
will
drink
again
o
3
75
definitely
good
for
what
it
is
i
was
expecting
more
coffee
but
a
decent
american
stout
nonetheless
o
an
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
stout
highly
sessionable
goes
well
with
meals
including
breakfast
i
had
my
first
today
with
sunday
brunch
instead
of
coffee
and
it
was
lovely
but
its
also
a
good
sipper
slightly
superior
as
such
to
the
new
stone
cms
at
not
much
more
than
half
the
price
a
deft
use
of
an
otherwise
awful
product
balances
the
syrupy
nature
of
autocrat
with
a
decent
base
stout
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
its
all
welldone
and
thats
more
than
enough
overall
i
knew
i
would
dig
this
its
just
such
a
great
concept
for
a
stout
even
if
its
more
straight
coffee
than
coffee
milk
its
an
excellent
stout
i
would
love
to
see
them
add
this
to
their
annual
seasonal
lineup
it
would
make
a
great
beer
to
look
forward
to
every
winter
narrangansetts
craft
offerings
never
let
me
down
and
this
may
be
my
favorite
one
since
the
straightup
porter
overall
disappointed
wanted
a
good
local
milk
stout
but
got
watery
maybe
malt
liquid
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
aromas
of
roast
coffee
cream
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
murphys
but
add
some
coffee
to
it
earthy
bitter
roasted
grains
with
a
bit
of
cream
and
a
whole
lot
of
coffee
medium
to
thin
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
silky
mouthfeel
decent
enough
brew
but
a
bit
heavy
on
the
coffee
without
enough
body
or
sweetness
of
something
to
back
it
up
o
its
ok
lot
of
coffee
flavor
and
the
price
is
always
right
on
narrangansett
i
wouldnt
buy
again
the
porter
that
apparently
is
discontinued
is
far
better
i
loved
that
beer
not
much
aroma
a
little
nutty
if
anything
served
on
tap
at
sullivans
in
pawtucket
thought
it
was
unavailable
so
wanted
to
try
it
smooth
flavor
very
drinkable
very
little
aftertaste
soso
head
but
left
decent
lacing
body
was
kind
of
weak
decent
carbonation
feel
it
was
made
to
be
a
flashinthepan
rithing
by
adding
the
autocrat
name
to
it
i
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
i
do
the
gansett
porter
hope
they
repeat
it
next
year
probably
comparable
to
sams
winter
lager
overall
an
above
average
slightly
sweet
coffee
beer
the
coffee
is
not
overpowering
tasty
but
just
above
average
for
the
style
imagine
a
5050
split
of
iced
coffee
with
dark
beer
and
this
would
be
the
likely
result
theres
little
else
to
noteno
cream
no
hop
and
very
little
residual
sugar
the
body
is
thin
with
a
decent
level
of
carbonation
a
good
novelty
i
bought
this
can
out
of
curiosity
but
i
was
afraid
to
drink
it
for
a
few
weeks
because
i
feared
it
would
be
way
too
sweet
surprisingly
it
isnt
it
is
sweet
but
it
works
the
coffee
flavor
could
be
better
but
i
suppose
that
judgment
is
wrong
if
youre
a
huge
fan
of
autocrat
i
guess
its
a
rhode
island
thing
the
taste
is
also
a
coffee
and
cream
paradise
with
a
mildly
bitter
bite
coming
up
behind
not
bad
at
all
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
as
the
name
implies
its
a
stronglyflavored
coffee
beer
and
its
a
very
good
one
o
decent
milk
stout
a
great
changeup
from
a
coffee
porter
as
a
nice
coffee
flavored
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
pair
this
with
jalapeno
poppers
or
a
similar
spicy
appetizer
o
the
acidity
and
astringency
really
wear
on
the
palate
and
make
it
tough
to
drink
towards
the
end
the
sweeter
lactose
side
of
things
is
stifled
on
the
whole
very
solid
not
amazing
not
mindblowing
but
very
very
solid
as
a
native
of
rhode
island
gansett
did
both
themselves
and
autocrat
proud
with
this
one
and
i
hope
it
comes
around
again
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
a
really
nice
beer
thin
at
first
but
grows
bolder
and
more
complex
well
balanced
a
great
drinker
or
it
would
be
good
to
put
in
stew
or
chili
id
return
when
it
grows
colder
it
is
very
hard
to
find
im
in
southeast
massachusetts
and
find
it
sold
out
all
over
the
area
and
im
very
disappointed
that
this
is
a
limited
brew
i
really
hope
that
the
gansett
crew
will
add
this
to
the
family
its
a
welcome
addition
o
overall
i
really
love
the
beer
hard
to
find
in
rhode
island
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
now
it
seems
its
hard
to
find
because
people
figured
out
hey
this
is
an
awesome
brew
its
my
new
favorite
from
gansett
but
drinkable
o
absolutely
fantastic
offering
here
from
good
old
gansett
have
to
say
this
would
wash
down
a
couple
of
hot
weinies
quite
well
o
gansett
did
a
solid
job
with
this
one
very
easy
drinking
coffee
brew
unlike
most
coffee
infused
stouts
that
need
to
be
sipped
this
one
goes
down
very
easily
and
would
go
well
with
a
classic
new
england
breakfast
couple
over
easy
some
hash
browns
bacon
and
sausage
not
epic
but
a
great
coffee
stout
and
a
steal
for
the
price
16oz
tall
boy
pours
a
super
dark
brownish
black
color
with
a
half
inch
of
khaki
head
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
chocolate
with
light
and
sweet
cofee
slight
amount
of
earth
the
taste
is
when
the
roasty
coffee
flavor
comes
out
dark
and
sweet
coffee
with
some
milk
chocolate
earth
and
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
towards
the
end
finishes
nicely
with
some
more
of
the
coffee
and
lactose
mouthfeel
is
light
with
lots
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
overall
a
great
addition
to
the
gansett
lineup
i
hope
this
one
becomes
part
of
the
regular
lineup
i
was
surprised
at
the
drinkability
of
this
milkstout
i
plan
on
drinking
more
of
this
in
the
future
overall
a
tasty
treat
but
not
anything
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
check
it
out
pretty
interesting
concept
that
could
have
easily
turned
out
bad
im
pleased
overall
surprisingly
lacking
from
the
ba
version
pours
a
thick
black
with
little
mocha
head
the
smell
is
sweet
with
heavy
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
with
a
few
hints
of
cinnamon
as
well
the
taste
starts
sweet
and
heavy
with
the
spices
coming
on
then
finishing
very
spicy
with
some
heat
almost
like
a
chili
pepper
beer
it
has
a
heavy
thick
mouthfeel
smooth
with
very
little
carbonation
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
the
spicy
finish
deters
me
from
liking
it
a
subpar
stout
infused
with
excessive
heat
to
compensate
there
is
definitely
a
habenero
kick
to
it
which
lingers
the
other
components
work
against
each
othe
imo
the
mouthfeel
is
oddly
smooth
for
a
beer
with
this
type
of
bite
on
the
back
end
3
535
good
chocolate
really
good
hot
peppers
notsogood
mouthfeel
thick
head
definitely
got
some
habaneros
in
there
not
overwhelming
which
i
am
glad
of
a
good
beer
not
thick
lingering
flavor
which
i
also
like
i
am
not
disappointed
that
i
got
a
six
pack
had
this
on
tap
after
reading
other
reviews
i
think
some
people
must
have
very
delicate
palates
when
it
comes
to
heat
strong
initial
coffee
chocolate
taste
finishes
in
a
smooth
yummy
tingle
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
just
a
hint
of
pepper
taste
itself
im
a
big
fan
of
odd
sides
unique
combinations
and
i
loved
this
nice
smell
not
a
fan
of
the
habanero
the
heat
of
the
habanero
on
the
tonsils
detracts
the
taste
of
the
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
coffee
solid
black
color
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
dissipates
almost
instantly
aromas
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
a
whole
lot
of
chocolate
and
some
light
earth
and
roast
to
round
us
out
the
flavor
is
spices
up
front
with
chocolate
coming
in
next
nutmeg
pops
out
again
before
the
spicy
heat
settles
into
the
back
of
the
throat
and
just
lingers
there
medium
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
that
is
a
tasty
beer
could
use
a
hint
more
carbonation
but
i
still
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
it
o
very
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
overwhelm
tmo
not
as
full
bodied
as
i
expected
but
the
flavor
is
there
a
wonderful
blend
of
chocolate
spice
coffee
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
super
silky
super
smooth
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
then
again
this
isnt
an
imperial
stout
great
great
great
beer
definitely
seek
this
out
i
like
spicy
beers
and
was
very
curious
how
a
coffee
spice
and
habanero
pepper
flavored
beer
would
come
together
overall
a
good
beer
definitely
drinkable
but
you
must
like
spicy
things
to
enjoy
i
could
see
myself
drinking
12
at
a
time
but
no
more
than
that
in
single
evening
my
first
review
so
this
will
be
brief
and
echo
others
pours
with
a
thin
head
which
was
a
little
surprising
great
chocolate
and
spice
flavors
with
a
perfect
amount
for
me
of
habanero
on
the
back
end
very
interesting
drink
that
grows
on
you
only
negative
as
others
have
noted
is
the
watery
mouthfeel
maybe
not
a
go
to
beer
that
you
always
have
on
hand
but
certainly
one
to
try
and
to
savor
on
occasion
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
this
is
a
delicious
and
drinkable
stout
that
gets
better
as
it
goes
the
flavor
on
this
beer
is
great
i
found
the
spice
from
the
habanero
was
hiding
on
the
bottom
with
the
settled
yeast
the
only
thing
holding
this
beer
back
was
the
mouthfeel
i
found
it
very
watery
finally
starting
to
get
some
habanero
on
the
back
end
really
nice
pretty
good
stuff
overall
this
beer
was
an
experience
to
drink
odd
side
really
balanced
all
the
ingredients
well
and
produced
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
i
have
ever
drank
overall
a
great
and
complex
light
stout
a
good
change
up
from
all
the
big
and
super
roasty
and
hoppy
stouts
dark
brown
beer
with
a
brown
head
smells
like
chocolate
and
coffee
has
a
strong
coffee
flavor
with
a
hint
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
has
a
nice
burn
from
the
habanero
at
the
end
a
little
harsh
but
still
enjoyable
surprisingly
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
version
seems
a
little
sweeter
and
has
less
of
a
bite
than
this
i
really
enjoy
the
concept
and
beers
like
this
is
the
reason
i
admire
odd
side
ales
for
their
creativity
ive
had
this
on
tap
at
oddside
on
tap
at
other
places
and
in
the
bottle
i
seem
to
remember
that
about
a
year
ago
i
thought
it
was
with
too
little
body
it
seems
this
has
improved
since
then
however
it
could
still
bear
a
bit
more
5
base
malt
and
a
bit
less
5
roasted
malt
as
it
stands
however
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
in
which
you
can
really
taste
all
the
ingredients
and
they
are
all
in
balance
with
each
other
a
testament
to
the
brewers
as
this
is
a
tricky
recipe
overall
the
smell
got
me
interested
flavour
kept
me
interested
but
the
mouthfeel
absolutely
derailed
this
beer
it
wouldnt
hurt
to
get
some
more
body
in
there
overall
nice
adjuncts
even
if
they
overpower
the
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
cinnamon
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
cinnamon
and
pepper
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
nice
cocoa
and
cinnamon
qualities
all
around
its
ironic
that
i
realized
this
beers
true
power
after
it
disappeared
from
shelves
12
for
a
sixer
isnt
the
best
price
but
still
pretty
fair
its
not
quite
in
the
same
league
but
this
tastes
like
a
satisfying
little
brother
of
prairie
bomb
definitely
get
it
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelf
o
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
wish
the
appearance
was
better
and
think
this
would
be
better
as
a
richer
fuller
imperial
stout
still
really
really
enjoyed
this
beer
o
this
is
a
great
pass
at
the
spicy
stouts
the
flavours
all
blend
together
quite
well
overall
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
i
am
really
getting
into
these
mexican
style
stouts
lately
this
beer
is
honestly
just
as
good
as
prairie
bomb
the
only
difference
is
that
prairie
bomb
has
a
thick
full
mouthfeel
that
is
just
way
better
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
and
i
honestly
did
not
expect
this
beer
to
be
this
good
its
my
first
introduction
odd
sides
ales
but
this
beer
has
won
me
over
i
am
a
fan
of
this
michigan
brewery
o
this
is
a
very
unique
stout
with
some
heat
in
the
back
end
very
impressive
look
to
this
along
with
an
inviting
smell
that
works
into
a
really
solid
tasting
brew
loses
points
with
a
bad
aftertaste
and
mouthfeel
i
will
not
get
this
again
smells
like
chocolate
and
the
taste
follows
up
front
some
coffee
and
creamy
smoothness
in
the
middle
it
then
leaves
you
with
mild
lingering
pepper
by
far
the
best
pepper
infused
beer
i
have
tried
the
pepper
is
there
but
never
overbearing
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
i
really
cant
believe
that
this
isnt
rated
higher
i
was
originally
thinking
that
this
is
one
of
those
perfect
beervana
moments
but
the
more
i
keep
drinking
this
beer
the
more
i
really
like
it
appearance
is
like
any
other
stoutdark
and
opaque
with
a
small
amount
of
head
smells
of
chocolate
light
coffee
roast
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
tastes
of
chocolate
cinnamon
and
on
the
back
end
the
perfect
amount
of
heat
mouthfeel
is
moderate
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
it
would
have
more
body
and
little
bit
more
sweetness
but
this
is
a
terrific
beer
as
it
stands
must
get
more
man
this
sucker
packs
some
real
heat
not
for
the
timid
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
spicy
foods
this
will
fit
right
in
with
ya
lovely
brew

but
dig
the
hot
pepper
burn
o
chocolatey
coffee
with
a
rnice
ound
bitterness
the
beer
definatly
came
alive
as
it
warmed
up
verdict
an
ambitious
beer
that
really
misses
the
mark
i
do
have
to
say
that
i
appreciate
that
all
the
adjuncts
are
notably
represented
in
the
beer
and
that
the
habañero
isnt
too
overpowering
however
the
balance
is
poor
the
body
lacks
any
substance
and
it
just
all
around
fails
to
redeem
in
any
way
overall
i
thought
this
was
very
nice
beer
and
very
nice
example
of
the
style
all
the
aspects
seem
to
work
pretty
well
with
each
other
and
they
make
for
one
flavorful
and
unique
stout
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
and
the
taste
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
the
warming
heat
would
start
to
wear
on
me
after
a
couple
so
that
would
be
my
limit
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
well
all
the
different
aspects
in
this
beer
worked
together
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
i
thought
it
was
a
little
too
thin
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
wouldnt
mind
keeping
some
in
the
fridge
for
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
beer
a
like
this
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
coffee
beers
and
doesnt
mind
some
spice
to
go
along
with
it
i
pretty
much
recommend
it
to
all
my
friends
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
a
little
different
then
the
draft
version
since
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
seemed
a
little
toned
done
but
other
than
that
it
was
pretty
much
just
how
it
remember
it
would
put
it
up
there
with
citra
and
bean
flicker
as
my
favorite
bottled
beers
by
them
so
far
good
job
odd
side
ales
keep
up
the
good
work
and
interestingly
unique
beers
o
if
youre
going
to
put
mocha
in
the
name
of
your
beer
you
need
to
have
coffee
and
chocolate
having
chocolate
in
this
beer
would
improve
it
by
leaps
and
bounds
as
it
would
compliment
the
coffee
and
pepper
very
well
and
keep
the
spices
from
being
too
cloying
hopefully
we
will
see
another
version
of
this
from
oddside
with
chocolate
that
would
be
a
great
beer

mayan

a

id
appreciate

if
it

especially
this
much

andor
similar
tastes
in
my
stouts
during
the
summer
for
what
its
worth
id
only
bump
my
score
slightly
either
way
definitely
a
unique
stout
so
give
it
a
whirl
o
i
had
this
on
tap
and
loved
it
the
bottle
version
is
good
but
i
prefer
this
on
draft
was
pleasantly
surprised

this
beer
hits
your

you
start
to
feel
the
heat
oh
yes
and
wait
for
it
bam
cloves

wow
lingering
heat
went
superb
with
my
brisket
i
will
be
looking
for
this
in
bottles
i
hope
o
nice
and
different
stout
lacks
some
body
but
has
a
nice
peppery
kick
thanks
to
justin
for
sharing
the
growler
good
but
not
great
would
drink
it
again
a
good

weak
across
the
board
beyond
that
i
could
list
20
beers
same
style
that
are
superior
too
watery
and
carbonated
for
a
stout
great
beer
good
for
both
beer
and
coffee
lovers
one
of
the
most
underrated
stouts
ive
had
absolutely
delicious
and
pretty
easy
to
find
in
california
what
am
i
drinking
water
hardly
passable
as
a
stout
thin
to
medium
mouth
feel
taste
didnt
live
up
to
the
initial
aromas
slightly
dry
lingering
after
taste
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
assuming
that
you
enjoy
the
tastearoma
of
coffee
without
any
associated
sweetness
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
beer
borders
on
being
sessionable
when
i
saw
coffee
stout
i
expected
more
of
a
sweeter
beer
not
so
the
case
with
this
one
tastes
exactly
like
a
cold
brewed
coffee
with
fizz
if
you
like
that
taste
this
one
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
for
me
this
would
do
much
better
on
nitro
or
at
least
with
less
carbonation
other
than
that
i
probably
would
get
this
again
i
guess
the
lowish
review
has
to
do
with
my
expectation
more
than
the
actual
flavor
was
expecting
a
run
of
the
mill
stout
but
actually
very
flavorful
and
smooth
going
down
the
coffee
taste
is
very
noticeable
in
the
beer
also
sense
some
light
bitterness
and
a
little
sweetness
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
get
it
again
overall
a
decent
coffee
stout
overall
excellent
beer
better
than
i
expected
ill
likely
go
out
and
pick
up
another
bottle
eventually
another
awesome
beer
from
san
diego
im
convinced
any
beer
brewed
in
san
diego
is
going
to
be
amazing
and
this
one
did
not
let
up
this
beer
is
absolutely
amazing
in
every
way
possible
would
i
want
it
on
a
hot
day
to
cool
me
down
no
but
its
a
chocolate
and
coffee
lovers
dream
come
true
if
you
like
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
this
beer
is
very
comparable
to
that
and
thats
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
go
get
this
d
this
was
a
good
coffee
stout
with
simple
but
solid
scent
and
taste
the
body
wasnt
right
but
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
nice
to
try
but
maybe
not
top
tier
o
wellcrafted
light
version
of
the

is

when
held
up

i
enjoyed
it
the
flavor
has
the
coffee
dialed
down
its
still
strong
and
dominant
but
not
overwhelming
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side
and
the
carbonation
on
the
high
side
overall
a
bit
of
a
onedimensional
beercoffee
without
sugar
or
cream
o
quite
good
i
very
much
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
the
second
beer
from
coronado
that
i
have
had
and
it
is
very
tasty
would
definitely
buy
it
again
overall
mixed
coffee
seems
almost
like
coffee
syrup
or
extract
but
has
a
roasty
tannic
note
as
well
like
hot
brewed
and
condensed
the
fudgey
chewy
and
creamy
oat
aspect
is
nice
but
the
sticky
syrupy
isnt
some
nice
flashes
and
some
not
so
nice
poured
a
clear
deep
brown
not
black
with
a
what
i
initially
thought
was
a
fizzy
head
the
head
however
settled
into
a
creamier
consistency
and
had
great
retention
and
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
fairly
weak
with
only
some
mild
coffee
notes
and
a
slight
earthiness
to
it
tastewise
there
was
a
little
more
coffee
flavor
especially
up
front
with
some
more
pronounced
earthy
hops
towards
the
finish
there
was
a
decent
fullness
on
the
palate
and
a
little
bit
of
a
crisp
hops
bite
on
the
finish
not
a
mindblower
but
a
decent
beer
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
molassesbrown
coloring
with
no
head
there
was
no
sound
of
carbonation
when
i
pried
the
cap
either
this
beer
pours
smooth
and
slick
aromas
of
rich
toffee
bitter
coffee
notes
some
molasses
highlights
subtle
roast
character
and
a
creamy
sweetness
the
nose
leans
a
bit
more
to
the
sweet
side
than
i
was
expecting
but
smells
good
regardless
flavors
are
slightly
roasted
forward
with
a
subtle
coffee
bitterness
in
the
backbone
some
sweet
highlights
throughout
but
mostly
the
coffee
notes
shine
through
on
the
palate
very
dry
and
smooth
bodied
with
no
frills
to
distract
the
aftertaste
is
a
building
roasted
coffee
bitterness
as
you
go
the
finish
is
slick
and
dry
at
the
same
time
like
i
said
no
frills
but
this
is
a
solid
drinkable
brew
purchased
at
sprouts
in
poway
ca
pours
very
dark
blackish
color
decent
lacing
and
a
whiteish
head
that
faded
quickly
smell
is
really
great
coffee
faint
hints
of
chocolate
some
nice
earthy
undertones
too
taste
is
very
coffee
forward
kinda
reminds
me
of
those
chocolate
espresso
beans
some
people
like
to
eat
for
a
dessert
i
found
the
coffee
flavor
on
this
stout
really
nice
its
the
first
thing
that
really
hits
the
palate
and
its
bitterness
followed
by
some
malts
and
chocolate
to
balance
it
out
makes
for
a
very
pleasent
drinking
experience
not
a
particularly
thick
stout
with
a
pretty
thin
mouthfeelvery
much
like
a
cup
of
coffee
but
even
a
russian
imperial
stout
enthusiast
can
find
a
enjoyable
beer
in
this
one
more
coffee
grounds
come
out
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
nice
stout
that
worth
trying
overall
its
quite
drinkable
for
its
weakness
and
its
pleasant
enough
overall
theres
certainly
at
least
some
interest
there
it
feels
a
bit
like
its
neither
committing
to
being
light
nor
is
it
being
really
rich
one
way
or
the
other
and
itd
be
very
good
on
the
lighter
side
compared
to
modern
day
stouts
but
does
not
lack
in
the
flavor
department
at
all
smooth
roasty
coffee
and
barley
leads
the
way
in
a
drinkable
stout
poured
into

8
oz

almost
dirty
with

i
like
a
dryer
earthy
stout
but
this
may
have
been
a
little
over
the
top
in
the
category
for
me
nice
flavour
could
use
a
bit
more
coffee
character
in
there
overall
a
tasty
easy
drinking
stout
taste
was
disappointing
a
little
astringent
leaving
a
bitter
aftertaste
with
very
thinwatery
mouthfeel
beer
didnt
match
its
aroma
tried
it
chilled
and
at
room
temperature
did
not
develop
much
character
o
powerful
coffee
flavor
and
aroma
in
this
make
this
a
great
go
to
if
youre
into
coffee
but
its
another
good
mark
in
the
book
for
me
as
far
as
corodado
goes
food
match
if
you
want
to
drink
beer
in
the
morning
like
some
sort
of
loser
then
this
is
a
good
replacement
for
coffee
along
with
the
baconeggtoastsunday
edition
newspaper
the
last
one
to
read
not
eat
you
might
be
on
to
a
winner
you
morningbeerdrinker
loser
overall
a
well
executed
coffee
stout
coronado
brewing
the
taste
leans
towards
a
bitter
cup
of
black
coffee
as
opposed
to
a
sugary
mocha
latte
a
smoother
creamier
body
could
make
this
stout
even
more
special
pours
a
dark
kola
hue
with
a
fast
vanishing
one

head
and
sporadic
lacingthe
smell
is
strong
coffee
with
tobacco
and
portthe
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
over
carbonated
with
tastes
of
chocolatecoffeetobacco
and
finished
with
a
roasted
malty
sweetness
and
overall
its
average
and
would
not
buy
again
cheers
overall
a
decent
beer
but
a
little
to
light
in
body
and
a
little
to
heavy
in
smoky
flavor
for
me
add
some
oats
or
malto
dextrin
and
youve
got
yourself
a
better
beer
not
great
d
definitely
more
of
a
sessionable
table
stout
coffee
flavors
are
nice
but
not
particularly
robust
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
of
a
letdown
for
me
would
have
this
again
on
tap
or
nitro
even
would
be
nice
dominated
by
coffee
a
little
one
note
but
the
coffee
does
make
it
a
guilty
pleasure
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
but
if
they
got
the
carbonation
under
control
this
could
be
world
class
imo
a
very
tasty
and
quality
coffee
makes
this
beer
earthy
and
darkroasted
i
like
it
overall
just
a
regular
coffee
beer
overall
a
sessionable
pick
me
up
stout
with
agreeable
flavor
but
i
found
it
a
bit
thin
and
watery
its
not
bad
id
get
it
again
someday
overall
nice
easy
drinking
straightforward
coffee
stout
a
solid
offering
from
coronado
pours
a
solid
three
fingers
of
very
dark
brown
foam
while
frothy
with
many
larger
bubbles
the
retention
is
credible
and
long
lasting
the
lacing
comes
in
fairly
thick
streaks
but
this
tends
to
slide
away
swiftly
at
first
glance
the
liquid
seems
black
but
it
is
likely
the
darkest
shade
of
brown
possible
completely
opaque
no
visible
bubbles
no
hint
of
other
coloration
at
the
rims
the
nose
is
quite
roasty
with
a
heavy
emphasis
on
the
coffee
quite
milky
too
black
fruits
and
raisins
oatmeal
and
other
sweeter
baking
grains
splash
of
mineral
water
overall
its
not
that
sugary
but
likewise
it
does
not
have
a
noticeable
hoppy
charge
to
it
either
fullbodied
dense
and
reluctant
to
move
freely
it
has
a
strong
drying
effect
on
the
mouth
to
the
point
where
it
impairs
the
flavors
coffee
powdered
dark
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
molasses
yet
no
core
of
sweetness
the
plum
cherry
fruit
diminished
and
no
citric
nor
floral
element
the
minor
doughy
breadiness
helps
carbonation
is
low
but
not
absent
some
chicory
notes
at
the
end
smooth
but
the
dustiness
adds
to
its
lack
of
flow
and
slightly
dilute
ending
not
horrible
but
nothing
i
would
purchase
a
second
time
overall
a
pretty
straightforward
approach
to
a
coffee
stout
easy
to
drink
and
approachable
but
nothing
particularly
extraordinary
or
unique
here
overall
i
am
not
wowd
by
this
stout
but
am
impressed
they
made
such
a
balanced
coffee
stout
totally
worth
the
6
50
paid
and
i
would
do
it
again
coronado
blue
ridge
coffee
stout
pours
a
deep
brown
with
two
fingers
of
mocha
head
the
aroma
is
about
what
youd
expect
from
a
coffee
stout
coffee
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
robustly
roasty
at
first
and
that
is
only
doubled
by
the
coffee
flavors
that
present
themselves
theres
nothing
sweet
in
this
stout
at
all
its
all
roast
all
the
time
some
hops
help
contribute
to
the
overall
bitterness
of
the
beer
its
lacking
a
little
in
complexity
but
its
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
light
for
style
and
wellcarbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
good
its
a
solid
coffee
stout
o
a
decent
offering
with
room
for
improvement
having
it
on
nitro
would
improve
it
tremendously
i
feel
overall
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
coronado
blue
ridge
coffee
stout
i
would
blame
the
name
more
than
anything
else
in
fact
right
under
the
name
it
says
ale
brewed
with
coffee
there
you
have
it
folks
ale
that
jives
with
my
take
a
moderately
dry
yankee
stout
for
those
caffeine
freaks
out
there
you
can
certainly
taste
the
guest
ingredient
in
this
one
i
have
to
give
credit
however
for
as
strong
as
the
coffee
initially
seems
theres
enough
else
going
on
to
keep
the
rest
of
us
nonusers
and
nonearly
risers
happy
with
a
10
price
tag
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
a
second
its
decent
beer
but
i
could
get
nearly
a
6
pack
of
a
similar
quality
for
what
i
spent
on
a
bomber
overall
this
coffee
stout
is
not
showing
off
and
not
falling
behind
the
coffee
or
roasted
malt
kind
of
lend
a
burnt
taste
to
the
beer
that
is
a
bit
off
putting
someone
described
on
here
a
flavor
of
cigarettes
i
do
however
like
the
low
alcohol
coffee
is
very
sessionable
why
shouldnt
coffee
stout
be
im
not
much
of
a
coffee
drinker
but
this
stuff
might
help
sway
me
its
5
4
in
the
bottled
version
bought
the
22
oz
bottle
at
ibis
market
in
mission
hills
sd
o
a
drinkable
coffee
stout
good
flavours
nothing
wowing
but
a
solid
wellmade
effort
this
coffee
stout
heads
in
the
direction
of
an
ink
black
color
topped
with
a
mochatinted
head
leaving
its
marks
around
the
glass
are
healthy
doses
of
lace
you
can
expect
lots
of
coffee
in
the
aroma
theres
mocha
and
chocolate
covered
coffee
beans
and
a
nice
roasty
aspect
too
theres
a
theme
going
on
here
and
its
coffee
which
continues
into
the
taste
the
flavor
is
coffee
all
the
way
with
a
light
stout
aspect
that
attempts
to
catch
ones
attention
a
little
mocha
makes
its
case
but
this
is
all
coffee
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
very
bubbly
body
a
bit
overcarbonated
for
what
i
like
in
a
stout
in
summary
this
is
an
acceptable
coffee
beer
one
that
tastes
more
like
a
coffee
than
a
beer
d
not
going
to
be
my
goto
might
be
good

ice
cream
and
chocolate

opaque

some

around

a
small

on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
roasted
coffee
beans
and
some
slight
cocoa
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
but
there
is
a
slight
sourness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
better
smell
than
taste
in
my
opinion
however
the
slight
sourness
i
am
getting
in
the
taste
is
unexpected
overall
not
a
bad
coffee
stout
very
drinkable
this
beer
could
be
really
good
if
aged
in
some
bourbon
or
whiskey
barrels
for
a
couple
years
overall
a
good
coffee
stout
mellow
and
enjoyable
o
very
nice
coffee
stout
would
call
it
more
of
a
porter
but
would
be
good
for
breakfast
overall
i
like
this
brew
i
have
frequent
the
cbc
just
for
a
pint
of
this
bad
boy
one
of
the
most
significant
coffee
smelling
and
tasting
brews
ive
had
good
stuff
i
like
a
good
coffee
stout
like
the
next
guy
but
this
just
leaned
way
too
heavy
to
the
dark
side
of
things
just
not
enough
actual
flavor
beyond
charred
roast
coming
through
and
this
could
have
also
used
some
more
balancing
sweetness
there
were
a
lot
of
interesting
looking
beers
on
tap
here
during
our
visit
and
this
one
left
me
disappointed
overall
a
very
good
stout
d
while
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
this
is
a
very
coffeeforward
stout
with
a
bold
roasted
malt
presence
and
nice
chocolate
character
to
complement
the
heavy
coffee
flavor

tan

a
strong
chocolate
taste
and
a
little

roasted
coffee
taste
some
dark

somewhat
watery
palate
this
beer
would
benefit
greatly
from
an
improved
mouthfeel
creamy
and
more
carbonated
would
make
this
one
a
winner
this
tastes
exactly
the
way
it
sounds
id
like
to
drink
it
with
a
big
plate
of
beans
very
unique
loved
it
great
graham
cracker
and
marshmallow
smell
and
flavor
but
still
tastes
like
a
stout
had
the
highwater
campfire
stout
based
on
a
recommendation
from
a
friend
and
it
was
a
great
recommendation
a
very
good
stout
with
a
rich
but
smooth
feel
and
taste

definitely
a
smoresy
aroma
to
it
melting
marshmallow
graham
cracker
and
some
milk
chocolate
all
come
through
backed
by
a
thick
body
for
heft
a
little
too
rich
for
me
in
anything
but
a
small
dose
overall
while
this
was
a
pleasant
offering
we
found
it
to
be
a
bit
inconsistent
to
start
things
off
the
aroma
was
fantastic
very
complex
malt
forward
and
balanced
by
enough
sweetness
the
taste
however
left
us
somewhat
perplexed
again
it
just
felt
inconsistent
in
what
it
was
trying
to
do
you
would
start
with
some
syrupy
sweet
notes
then
dive
into
some
deep
and
boozy
chemical
things
and
then
finish
off
with
a
unique
bitterness
the
next
sip
would
be
entirely
different
the
mouthfeel
lent
to
a
thinned
flavor
and
with
such
a
curious
showing
of
rummy
booziness
made
for
a
thought
provoking
display
to
put
it
nicely
intense
critique
and
criticism
aside
those
moments
of
chocolatey
and
vanilla
sweetness
created
a
more
fullflavored
experience
saving
the
beer
rather
substantially
i
think
i
got
an
old
bottle
high
sweetness
and
almost
metallic
that
befuddles
all
the
flavors
get
little
graham
cracker
if
at
all
wish
i
had
this
beer
on
campouts
it
would
get
me
to
go
more
often
super
nice
stout
on
draft
with
a
decent
abv
for
what
the
beer
is
nice
sweet
almost
marshmallow
undertones
to
it
flies
off
the
shelves
at
my
bar
very
good
beer
taste
like
smores
the
reason
im
giving
this
beer
a
4
0
is
because
its
a
fun
beer
this
really
tastes
like
smores
and
great
on
a
snowy
upstate
ny
night
taste
has
the
rich
caramelised
marshmallow
prune
coffee
candy
and
dark
toast
and
graham
cracker
toast
nice
sweetness
with
light
balancing
bitterness
this
beers
is
tasty
nice
smell
of
graham
crackers
i
did
think
being
called
campfire
that
there
would
be
a
smoked
note
somewhere
but
there
is
not
it
tastes
like
a
more
balanced
version
of
boulder
shake
very
impressive
and
inviting
aromas
of
smores
taste
is
slightly
less
impressive
a
very
good
cold
weather
stout
though
loaded
with
adjuncts
this
one
is
still
quite
tasty
o
i
love
this
stout
i
would
love
to
see
an
imperial
version
this
is
one
of
my
beer
tools
to
turn
people
to
the
dark
side
next
time
i
go
camping
you
better
believe
this
one
will
go
with
me
subtle
toasty
aroma
of
smores
incredibly
smooth
and
delicious
chocolate
taste
serves
well
with
slightly
salted
desserts
think
pretzels
salted
caramel
etc
this
is
my
favorite
dessert
beer
an
excellent
dessert
beer
extraordinary
in
terms
of
style
aroma
doesnt
give
you
much
but
the
taste
has
a
ton
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
and
is
extremely
smooth
i
was
damn
impressed
finished
the
whole
bottle
and
want
more
great
stout
i
wanted
so
so
much
more
based
on
that
nose
that
shouldnt
be
to
its
detriment
of
course
as
its
still
very
nice
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
beer
overall
a
clever
idea
for
a
beer
and
fun
to
drink
for
half
the
pint
but
i
found
that
i
couldnt
finish
it
due
to
the
sweetness

overall
i
decided
to
review
this
beer
because
it
was
so
interesting
omg
the
smell
is
ridiculous
fantastic
smell
i
recently
saw
a
fellow
ba
stocking
his
shopping
cart
with
6
of
these
so
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
i
really
do
love
the
smell
one
of
the
best
ever
although
its
very
polarizing
because
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
really
lets
down
for
me
id
say
a
very
solid
stout
just
for
the
smell
interesting
id
probably
buy
again
its
only
6
5
which
is
probably
the
issue
overall
okay
i
guess
not
sure
i
like
what
was
going
on
here
but
it
certainly
tasted
as
advertised
started
off
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
got
better
as
i
got
into
it
not
something
i
would
go
for
again
but
i
could
understand
why
someone
else
would
really
like
it
give
it
a
chance
and
see
for
yourself
overall
the
smell
is
so
good
i
can
just
sit
here
and
smell
it
without
drinking
it
and
in
many
ways
thats
the
way
to
go
with
this
beer
o
it
is
very
unique
to
have
the
smokey
marshmallow
flavor
without
it
it
would
be
pretty
generic
but
its
a
good
beer
to
try
o
it
sounds
odd
but
its
like
drinking
smores
and
its
delicious
definitely
worth
a
try
o
smores
in
a
glass
very
tasty
stuff
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
but
this
is
perhaps
best
consumed
split
with
others
while
its
not
really
sweet
although
it
is
decadent
its
quite
a
huge
task
to
consume
by
yourself
as
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
flavors
do
start
to
weigh
you
down
in
the
long
run
otherwise
its
a
neat
little
twist
on
the
style
with
a
flavor
and
feel
that
brings
me
back
to
many
late
nights
spent
around
campfires
back
in
the
day
overall
on
the
light
side
might
be
better
served
if
it
was
more
viscous
superb
smell
and
excellent
taste
worth
a
try
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
22
oz
bottle
i
mean
baby
we
cool
right
now
this
was
a
surprise
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
had
never
heard
of
his
beer
or
brewery
brought
this
to
a
local
tasting
tonight
was
the
star
of
the
show
deep
dark
rich
color
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
unbelievable
nose
on
this
straight
smores
taste
is
exactly
like
the
nose
smores
on
the
tongue
very
good
cant
wait
to
try
this
again
mf
this
coats
your
mouth
wonderfully
there
is
a
smooth
and
silky
quality
to
it
with
very
low
carbonation
it
leaves
your
mouth
with
a
slightly
dry
sensation
making
you
want
to
drink
more
highish
d
nice
sweetness
no
bitterness
at
all
good
carbonation
keeps
the
flavor
going
hints
of
coconut
nose
and
coconutcaramel
flavor
but
not
strong
overpowering
very
drinkable
but
can
be
filling
due
to
the
sweetness
should
be
really
good
with
a
rich
dessert
especially
chocolate
o
lives
up
to
itsdescription
very
well
really
coolunique
idea
for
a
beer
boost
for
awesome
creativity
deep
black
body
with
practically
no
head
or
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
interesting
with
chocolate
and
some
vanilla
as
well
as
light
smokiness
its
an
inviting
start
the
flavors
do
not
come
together
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
flavors
taste
artificially
added
rather
than
extracted
the
light
smoke
does
not
balance
out
the
beer
the
beer
does
not
sit
on
the
palate
well
either
this
was
a
total
miss
for
me
the
flavors
do
not
balance
well
and
it
tasted
like
a
gimmick
not
a
beer
the
artificial
taste
was
the
biggest
issue
overall
i
am
not
sure
where
everyone
is
getting
all
these
awesome
flavors
to
me
it
taste
like
licking
a
charcoal
briquet
even
if
it
was
just
a
smoke
stout
it
would
fail
at
being
just
that
since
its
not
very
balanced
overall
highwater
really
nailed
this
they
took
a
gimmicky
concept
put
it
into
a
bottle
and
made
a
respectable
stout
thats
rare
to
do
great
after
a
glass
but
im
not
so
sure
id
wanna
session
this
due
to
the
sweetness
at
worst
its
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
heres
a
well
put
together
ale
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
i
was
expecting
more
but
not
bad
by
any
means
i
was
just
hoping
for
great
it
definitely
has
a
very
marshmallow
taste
but
a
little
too
light
of
a
body
for
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
imo
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
i
had
to
try
it
it
was
well
beyond
my
expectations
super
tasty
and
actually
works
yes
its
super
sweet
but
no
more
so
than
any
good
chocolate
sweet
stout
they
just
add
a
few
more
things
in
there
but
add
plenty
of
roast
and
hops
to
tone
it
down
i
think
the
only
thing
that
would
elevate
it
to
amazing
for
me
would
be
just
a
touch
more
roast
a
touch
more
bitterness
but
not
much
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
and
i
wouldnt
hesistate
to
recommend
poured
into
a
maudite
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
black
in
the
glass
thin
light
brown
head
dissipates
slowly
into
a
thin
film
and
ring
around
the
glass
leaving
light
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
and
toasted
malt
vanilla
and
chocolate
flavor
follows
with
toasted
malt
sweet
vanilla
and
chocolate
finishing
a
bit
dryer
and
roasty
medium
bodied
flavor
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
expected
but
pleasant
flavors
an
interesting
take
on
an
american
style
stout
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
of
smoke
from
the
name
but
still
enjoyed
this
drinkability
easy
to
drink
tastes
like
smores
a
good
beer
o
an
excellent
impression
of
a
smore
in
a
stout
without
being
sweet
cloying
or
artificial
super
solid
this
beer
brings
me
back
to
camping
a
great
combination
of
flavors
on
tap
pours
a
dark
brown
with
small
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
and
leaves
a
very
minimal
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
marshmallow
graham
cracker
light
chocolate
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
a
light
roastiness
the
taste
has
quite
a
bit
of
initial
sweetness
with
marshmallow
and
vanilla
there
is
also
some
graham
cracker
and
light
chocolate
the
finish
has
a
light
roastiness
with
a
lingering
marshmallow
mediumlight
body
medium
carbonation
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
but
i
didnt
find
it
to
work
that
well
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
o
pleasantly
surprised
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
o
a
fun
beer
to
try
the
smore
character
is
definitely
there
and
tastes
and
smells
above
all
quite
good
a
tad
pricey
but
this
is
not
just
some
novelty
its
a
complete
effort
o
might
be
a
good
desert
beer
but
seems
more
like
a
novelty
couldnt
finish
my
glass
because
the
sweetness
was
just
too
overwhelming
overall
this
reminds
me
of
a
dry
irish
oyster
stout
with
some
subtle
sweet
additions
good
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
balance
of
flavors
the
graham
crackers
and
marshmallows
are
just
right
o
very
interesting
beer
for
sure
its
somewhat
of
a
novelty
brew
worth
trying
though
one
of
the
better
beers
that
is
supposed
to
taste
like
something
other
than
a
beer
o
this
was
a
decent
stout
that
i
enjoyed
trying
i
know
their
goal
was
to
create
a
campfire
stout
with
a
smore
like
presence
and
they
were
definitely
able
to
do
this
the
presence
was
definitely
detectable
in
the
smell
and
taste
however
the
tastemouthfeel
had
a
little
bit
too
much
booze
for
only
a
7
3
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
id
recommend
trying
it
if
you
like
really
sweet
beers
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
vanilla
and
marshmallows
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
nice
aromas
and
flavors
that
is
easy
to
drink
carbonations
fine
its
unobtrusive
t
definitely
not
as
sweet
as
it
smells
but
still
delivers
on
the
smores
light
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
vanilla
hit
first
with
graham
cracker
char
and
marshmallow
creeping
in
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lighter
than
it
probably
should
be
but
nonetheless
i
would
call
this
a
success
pours
almost
black
with
a
tan
head
nose
is
full
of
sweet
sugar
and
marshmallow
a
nice
toasted
sugar
note
graham
cracker
vanilla
and
milk
chocolate
smells
and
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
smore
tons
of
marshmallow
and
chocolate
flavor
graham
cracker
maltiness
a
hint
of
roast
and
sweet
sugar
really
awesome
stuff
3
5
d
decent
beer
worth
a
try
just
for
the
nose
this
would
have
scored
a
lot
better
is
the
bitterness
wasnt
so
distracting
drink
it
was
overall
a
good
beer
a
hard
to
make
work
beer
but
its
worth
a
shot
to
split
with
friends
as
a
dessert
beer
or
something
new
a
lot
better
than
rogues
attempt
at
a
donut
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
large
tan
head
that
takes
some
time
to
go
down
scent
is
quite
sweet
with
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
quite
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
toasted
marshmallows
just
like
the
label
says
great
aroma
on
this
one
taste
is
just
as
the
label
describes
there
is
a
slight
metallic
taste
up
front
but
it
disappears
after
a
couple
of
sips
great
smores
flavors
here
you
definitely
get
the
graham
cracker
marshmallow
and
chocolate
lovely
vanilla
along
with
a
bit
of
smoke
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
would
love
to
see
this
as
an
imperial
stout
with
more
body
higher
abv
and
maybe
some
barrel
aging
that
would
taste
amazing
this
one
is
great
though
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
the
best
thing
i
have
tasted
from
high
water
thus
far
solid
stout
really
really
interesting
stuffextremely
well
executed
even
if
the
concept
of
a
campfireroasted
sandwich
of
chocolate
and
marshmallow
is
not
your
thing
i
believe
ill
have
to
keep
my
eye
on
high
water
in
the
future
its
an
interesting
and
wellmade
beer
but
i
cant
say
that
i
really
like
it
all
that
much
i
would
love
to
try
it
from
a
nitro
tap
that
might
up
my
score
a
fair
bit
im
generally
not
a
big
milk
or
sweet
stout
fan
but
nitro
seems
to
help
out
that
said
if
you
are
a
milk
stout
fan
a
bottle
will
probably
be
right
up
your
alley
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
deserves
praise
for
taking
a
creative
risk
and
doing
it
well
overall
it
contributes
well
to
high
waters
mix
of
bold
traditional
styles
and
more
interesting
offerings
this
is
less
one
of
those
beers
you
drink
while
out
and
more
one
that
is
meant
to
be
consumed
fireside
as
the
bottle
hints
this
would
also
be
a
great
winter
beer
chocolate
bourbon
milkshake
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
very
thin
overall
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
dark
rich
robust
i
liked
it
wow
this
is
impressive
definitely
surpassed
my
expectation
highly
recommended
brewed
with
vanilla
i
dont
know
about
that
but
as
a
standard
stout
it
is
a
more
than
solid
offering
lacked
body
had
an
abnormal
odor
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
dissipates
almost
instantly
aromas
of
chocolate
roast
and
vanilla
dominate
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
charred
sugar
and
light
earth
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
big
chocolate
and
vanilla
countered
with
a
sharp
molasses
char
kind
of
flavor
happening
little
to
no
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
that
i
could
find
thick
body
with
an
oily
sugary
mouthfeel
and
a
faint
level
of
carbonation
5
3
abv
but
it
drinks
like
its
9
and
thick
inky
oily
as
shit
not
something
i
enjoyed
much
robust
coffee
and
coffee
grounds
molasses
nice
sugary
middle
with
vanilla
and
cream
compose
the
flavor
profile
nice
and
sweet
with
a
crisp
finish
my
first
beer
from
finchs
and
i
was
pleasantly
impressed
i
will
hunt
this
down
and
get
it
again
a
solid
milk
type
stout
with
a
higher
degree
of
residual
sugar
than
a
basic
american
stout
usually
has
but
without
the
body
added
by
the
lactose
its
lighter
than
others
texturally
but
the
flavors
are
real
robust
dark
specialty
grain
keeps
the
roast
high
and
the
bitterness
lower
than
usual
from
unmalted
roasted
barley
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
are
in
the
middle
of
this
and
a
vanilla
pudding
flavor
too
very
desserty
but
drinkable
since
its
not
to
huge
in
body
its
been
awhile
since
i
had
a
beer
from
these
guys
but
all
have
been
quite
good
if
i
remember
correctly
this
is
one
of
those
stouts
you
probably
go
back
to
again
and
again
if
its
for
sale
in
your
market
its
distinct
its
drinkable
and
its
just
rich
enough
i
like
the
way
the
grain
leads
the
way
and
builds
up
so
much
depth
lots
of
character
in
this
beer
very
well
made
was
a
pleasure
to
have
it
on
tap
rjt
secret
stache
pours
a
deep
brown
with
an
extremely
frothy
rather
tall
khaki
head
the
aroma
contains
sweet
notes
of
caramel
toffee
and
lots
of
roasted
malt
after
sampling
the
flavor
i
find
it
to
be
very
full
for
only
a
5
3
abv
beer
its
big
with
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
vanilla
bean
flavor
its
got
a
creamy
finish
and
a
pleasantly
soft
mouth
feel
overall
a
fine
balance
of
toasty
bitter
and
sweet
im
glad
i
tried
it
as
i
hadnt
heard
of
the
brewery
before
would
definitely
buy
again
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
stouts
i
have
ever
tried
the
coffee
hits
you
in
the
mouth
the
chocolates
warms
the
nose
and
the
vanilla
bean
makes
it
all
flow
smooth
this
is
a
sweeter
stout
but
one
i
can
finish
any
day
with
pour
over
vanilla
ice
cream
and
there
is
nothing
better
prost
the
brewer
manages
to
achieve
guinness
level
nitro
carbonation
and
creaminess
that
provides
a
perfect
vehicle
for
the
rich
palate
o
must
try
interesting
whiskey
like
rich
deep
stout
at
a
moderate
abv
but
sweet
for
some
secret
stache
stout
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
tan
lacing
head
there
is
a
big
roasted
aroma
hints
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
big
and
roasted
a
little
smokey
nice
vanilla
flavors
body
is
just
a
little
watery
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
if
the
body
was
fuller
it
could
be
great
o
well
done
with
the
addition
of
vanilla
it
introduces
itself
early
adding
a
depth
of
sweetness
to
the
aroma
and
taste
without
becoming
cloying
and
then
steps
aside
to
remind
you
that
this
is
a
stout
after
all
smooth
drinking
with
a
low
abv
this
stout
punches
well
above
its
weight
given
its
price
point
and
relative
obscurity
compared
to
similar
stouts
with
more
name
recognition
id
rate
this
beer
a
couple
of
points
higher
on
the
basis
of
those
two
factors
alone
but
focusing
on
what
this
stout
brings
to
the
table
it
is
highly
affordable
highly
delicious
and
all
from
a
tallboy
can
recommended
this
is
good
but
no
where
near
the
top
for
the
type
of
beer
it
is
overall
this
beer
is
not
available
in
my
part
of
the
country
but
i
would
partake
fairly
regularly
if
it
was
very
drinkable
chocolate
coffee
stout
that
doesnt
overwhelm
the
senses
but
makes
for
an
enjoyable
experience
o
my
first
finchs
beer
company
beer
and
wont
be
my
last
according
to
their
website
lactose
was
used
during
the
brewing
process
i
didnt
get
the
normal
sweetness
and
lessening
of
bitterness
lactose
tends
to
add
to
a
stout
either
way
this
is
a
great
stout
in
my
opinion
i
love
the
fact
it
comes
in
a
16ounce
can
a
well
done
yearround
stout
i
cant
wait
to
find
a
4pack
of
this
beer
sweet
tasting
for
sure
but
obnoxiously
so
lots
of
chocolately
malts
with
a
well
incorporated
hint
of
vanilla
no
layers
of
complexity
but
this
is
a
very
satisfying
drink
overall
an
excellent
easy
drinking
stout
i
am
a
big
fan
of
finch
beers
easy
drinking
not
overdone
and
lots
of
flavor
a
not
too
bad
stout
but
pretty
heavy
into
the
chocolate
good
palate
and
aroma
but
the
rapidly
diminishing
small
head
and
poor
lacing
detract
from
the
appearance
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
smokiness
without
being
sticky
or
overpowering
doesnt
assault
your
taste
buds
o
the
aroma
was
good
then
it
started
breaking
down
the
burnt
flavor
made
it
unpleasant
by
the
end
this
stout
leans
heavily
to
the
chocolate
malt
and
less
so
to
the
black
patent
malt
burnt
flavors
think
rich
porter
the
body
makes
this
a
very
smooth
beer
low
carbonation
the
aftertaste
features
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
overall
a
tasty
beer
that
may
be
best
described
as
a
stoutporter
hybrid
notes
quite
drinkable
and
very
good
for
a
cool
night
cheers
nice
job
on
a
very
sessionable
stout
as
easy
a
drinker
as
there
is
in
the
category
and
it
comes
it

overall
it
has
easy
drinking
qualities
with
a
solid
stout
base
and
vanilla
additions
light
years
better
than
their
flagship
ipa
o
overall
this
is
a
good
basic
american
stout
fans
of
the
style
should
be
pleased
o
i
didnt
pick
up
any
vanilla
as
mentioned
on
the
can
but
overall
i
liked
it
and
would
buy
again
o
tasty
and
a
solid
effort
all
the
right
parts
are
there
but
for
me
they
just
didnt
harominze
black
color
with
a
light
beige
head
smell
is
very
pronounced
with
malts
and
roastyness
taste
is
quite
tame
but
has
an
interesting
malt
character
and
an
inviting
sweetness
on
the
back
end
mild
body
low
carbonation
good
easy
drinking
lower
abv
stout
o
very
good
lots
of
vanilla
flavor
and
a
nice
toffee
touch
to
it
though
i
appreciate
the
lower
alcohol
content
of
this
one
because
its
packed
with
flavor
it
could
benefit
just
a
little
from
a
more
thick
and
velvety
composure
in
flavor
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
think
most
stout
lovers
are
going
to
enjoy
it
and
like
i
said
it
has
an
impressive
mouthfeel
despite
the
5
3
however
the
acidity
of
the
hops
and
the
roast
hurts
it
a
bit
and
doesnt
lend
to
me
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
any
given
time
4450
it
was
a
tasty
stout
but
nothing
stuck
out
to
me
about
it
ive
tried
plenty
of
other
chocolatey
coffee
stouts
before
and
this
tasted
very
similar
to
those
poured
a
blackish
body
with
minimal
tan
head
that
died
quick
mostly
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
a
little
breadiness
and
hint
of
coffee
and
vanilla
espresso
in
the
nose
the
beer
is
sweet
easy
to
drink
not
heavy
or
sticky
and
has
a
good
balance
between
chocolate
and
vanilla
sweetness
and
roastedcoffee
malts
along
with
touches
of
dark
fruit
i
can
only
think
of
black
cherries
and
something
sugary
like
molassessyrupfigs
and
has
a
complimentary
dry
finish
i
like
this
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
it
was
a
toochilled
can
or
just
mental
on
my
part
but
there
was
a
touch
of
medicinalmetallic
canniness
or
something
that
caused
some
of
the
sips
to
be
bitter
and
watery
shouldve
bought
the
bottle
still
a
good
beer
overall
for
an
only
5
3
abv
brew
this
beer
packs
quite
the
flavor
punch
a
nice
and
tasty
session
style
stout
the
taste
evolves
as
it
warms
with
the
same
distinctive
smoked
roasted
malts
and
vanilla
flavors
merging
ever
so
slightly
with
a
low
dry
hop
bitterness
it
evolves
in
favor
of
the
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
with
a
medium
body
modest
carbonation
overall
solid
after
only
a
slight
hiss
when
i
cracked
the
can
i
gave
this
one
a
pretty
aggressive
pour
and
ended
up
with
paperthin
khaki
layer
on
the
surface
impressively
black
though
with
absolutely
no
light
getting
through
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
bean
aromas

and
center
lactose
creaminess
caramelized

and
some

coffee
with

plenty
of
bittersweet

and

light
on
the
carbonation
creamy
texture
a
little
dry
char
developing
as
i
sip
it
would
make
a
nice
dessert
beer
though
many
wouldnt
even
consider
a
5
3
abv
stout
to
do
the
job
rich
creamy
very
nice
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
if
a
touch
sweet
for
my
tastes
definitely
one
that
i
would
grab
again
as
it
was
a
hit
with
my
wife
and
motherinlaw
who
both
thought
it
was
quite
tasty
would
be
a
really
nice
beer
with
dessert
overall
very
drinkable
but
suffers
in
that
it
is
thin
and
diluted
in
the
taste
fantastic
aroma
though
and
a
great
stout
for
those
wary
of
a
heavy
mouthfeel
secret
stache
features
outstanding
coloration
to
complement
its
delicious
chocolate
backbone
the
thin
body
is
a
disappointment
but
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
this
is
a
smooth
tasty
stout
with
great
drinkability
not
quite
as
amazing
as
i
recall
on
tap
but
still
very
good
o
the
smell
is
great
but
doesnt
quite
transfer
over
to
the
taste
which
is
kind
of
a
weird
mix
of
cloying
sweetness
ashy
roast
and
hops
still
a
good
low
abv
stout
with
strong
flavors
kind
of
similar
to
a
milk
stout
as
far
as
i
know
this
isnt
one
saw
this
about
a
year
ago
and
picked
up
the
last
four
pack
at
my
local
beverage
store
i
really
liked
it
i
was
hoping
to
get
some
more
later
on
but
the
store
said
it
didnt
sell
that
well
and
they
didnt
plan
on
ordering
anymore
bummer
well
today
was
a
good
day
as
it
just
happened
to
show
up
again
on
the
shelf
apparently
the
distributor
made
a
deal
the
store
could
not
refuse
for
such
a
low
alcohol
content
this
beer
is
a
really
really
big
beer
i
disagree
that
with
another
reviewer
who
thought
it
was
thin
it
truly
is
motor
oil
im
thinking
this
stuff
is
darker
than
any
of
the
imperial
stouts
ive
tried
and
ive
tried
more
than
a
few
its
characteristics
are
pretty
simple
chocolate
and
vanilla
and
im
ok
with
that
tastes
yummy
not
allot
of
crazy
things
going
on
like
a
high
alcohol
imperial
stout
but
no
minihangover
the
next
day
either
from
having
two
of
these
nothing
else
like
this
out
there
as
far
as
i
know
a
truly
unique
beer
but
more
of
a
niche
taste
not
for
everyone
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
very
complex
mainly
burnt
roast
and
vanilla
in
both
the
nose
and
the
head
id
like
the
body
to
be
thicker
too
othis
beer
is
almost
like
a
liquid
tootsie
roll
it
is
also
very
easy
to
drink
overall
id
drink
it
again
with
joy
if
someone
bought
me
a
pint
but
its
not
a
stout
id
seek
out
again
overall
not
bad
a
light
but
decent
vanilla
nice
dark
malt
characters
that
get
just
a
touch
acrid
a
little
yeasty
character
takes
away
from
it
a
bit
but
otherwise
nice
tasty
and
drinkable
a
decent
canned
stout
the
vanilla
adds
enough
to
save
it
from
being
average
but
doesnt
bump
it
too
far
either
overall
good
stuff
for
me
the
best
of
the
finch
bunch
to
date
solid
stout
with
a
large
cocoa
powder
flavor
and
some
vanilla
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
in
the
flavor
and
body
but
nothing
comes
off
as
bad
o
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
the
bolder
and
harsher
flavors
are
brought
into
balance
nicely
by
the
lactose
and
vanilla
sweetness
and
the
body
and
texture
go
a
long
way
to
increasing
drinkability
as
well
poured
from
the
can
into
a
oversize
wine
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
brown
but
not
quite
black
had
a
mocha
brown
2
finger

only
lasted
a
few
minutes
before
leaving
just
a
thin
layer
primary
aroma
was
chocolate
very
much
like
a
hersheys
bar
vanilla
with
a
small
hint
of
pepper
in
the
back
flavor
was
very
slightly
sweet
like
watery
chocolate
milk
but
also
had
sour
notes
coated
very
well
needed
perhaps
a
touch
of
carbonation
seemed
pretty
flat
overall
not
bad
but
not
very
flavorful
or
with
any
must
have
qualities
tried
this
beer
at
a
backyard
cookout
not
a
session
beer
though
the
alcohol
level
is
manageable
this
a
very
malty
sweet
stout
with
a
heavy
mouthfeel
the
beer
i
had
was
fairly
flat
which
i
like
in
this
style
it
was
far
too
sweet
and
heavy
for
a
labor
day
cookout
but
as
a
desert
beer
this
would
be
wonderful
overall
a
very
good
stout
overall
real
nice
drinking
and
light
and
full
of

this
is
a
nice
vanilla
milk
stout
with
a
good
roasty
character
and
a
little
sweetness
should
definitely
be
characterized
under
milksweet
stout
because
its
brewed
with
lactose
and
it
definitely
comes
through
providing
some
sweetness
along
with
the
vanilla
not
a
bad
value
at
10
59
for
a
4pack
of
16
oz
cans
a
very
flavorful
stout
in
a
can
i
would
like
to
try
their
other
stout
offerings
soon
because
this
is
the
most
flavorful
stout
ive
had
in
a
while
o
not
bad
its
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
though
so
i
doubt
ill
buy
this
again
well
worth
a
try
if
you
like
vanilla
or
cream
soda

as

pretty

with

but
a
nice

earthiness
keeps
it
in
checkalot
of
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
flavors
to
go
along
with
bitter
chocolate
at
the
onset
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
i
have
had
in
awhileits
sweet
but
its
also
got
a
big
earthyroasted
finish
the
crack
reveled
yet
another
brimful
craft
can
and
as
a
previous
reviewer
mentioned
not
only
are
you
definitely
not
getting
gypped
it
is
like
a
bakers
dozen
the
only
drawback
in
this
instance
is
that
it
is
a
very
dark
beer
and
if
it
splashed
on
white
or
colorful
clothing
it
might
be
an
issue
i
recommend
opening
it
away
from
the
cansumers
body
as
a
result
the
tallboy
nature
of
the
can
made
it
a
little
more
difficult
to
perform
an
inverted
glug
but
as
a
professional
i
was
able
to
pull
it
off
i
was
faced
with
a
finger
of
dense
deeptanlightbrown
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
dark
colabrown
which
allowed
for
zero
light
penetration
i
even
took
a
wee
dram
in
a
fest
tasting
glass
outside
to
see
if
i
could
get
any
traction
and
even
then
only
at
the
edges
the
srm
on
this
one
must
be
extremely
high
nose
smelled
like
french
vanilla
coffee
reminding
me
to
pick
up
some
of
giant
eagles
brand
the
next
time
i
am
near
one
to
quantify
there
were
roasty
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
but
with
vanilla
added
to
the
equation
i
have
never
made
or
drank
a
full
pot
of
french
vanilla
coffee
as
it
tends
to
be
too
sweet
but
i
am
pressing
on
with
this
one
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
an
oily
slickness
on
the
tongue
that
i
had
not
expected
previous
reviewers
had
led
me
to
expect
a
fullness
which
was
not
present
but
neither
was
there
anything
wrong
with
that
slick
feeling
the
taste
was
definitely
french
vanilla
coffee
and
i
recommend
a
name
change
to
finch
vanilla

this
disappointed
me
a

it

well
but
the
end
of
each

is
just
disappointing
and
bland
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
oomph
taste
roasted
coffee
flavor
with
a
little
chocolate
taste
is
quite
strong
so
i
dont
think
its
old
roasted
malt
still
slightly
sweet
couldnt
get
and
chocolate
and
only
faint
coffee
notes
what
a
positive
surprise
very
good
stout
intense
and
complex
but
not
tiresome
given
its
relatively
light
body
not
being
overly
sweet
and
actually
somewhat
refreshing
balancing
its
roasted
and
burnt
notes
this
is
almos
a
ris
recommendable
pours
a
deep
inky
black
with
no
light
getting
through
there
is
a
smidge
of
dark
tan
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
alcohol
esters
with
just
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
flips
this
around
with
much
more
emphasis
on
the
roasted
malts
it
has
a
slicker
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
smooth
finish
a
very
good
stout
overall
its
very
decent
but
many
lowabv
stouts
are
it
is
the
higherabv
stout
with
exceptional
quality
which
gains
the
notoriety
but
this
one
will
do
very
nice
mouthfeel
creamy
and
almost
chewy
medium
carbonation
o
overall
its
a
nice
american
stout
fit
to
the
style
i
may
be
biased
in
my
judging
because
i
prefer
the
ris
this
may
compete
in
that
style
as
well
overall
pretty
solid
extra
stout
that
has
ris
and
porter
features
pretty
solid
a
very
good
beer
russian
imperial
stout
for
the
little
guy
i
cant
handle
those
12
abv
brews
i
love
how
dark
this
one
is
almost
inky
looking
can
be
compared
to
certain
imperial
russian
stouts
depending
on
the
brewery
hints
of
coffee
very
smooth
and
slithers
down
your
throat
smells
very
robust
like
a
porter
and
i
sense
a
smoky
smell
as
well
just
going
by
taste
it
would
be
good
with
ice
cream
or
some
chocolate
dessert
the
mouth
feel
is
good
although
at
clocking
in
at
6
5
abv
it
could
use
a
little
more
alcohol
to
enhance
the
taste
and
even
out
the
robust
creamy
coffee
flavor
great
for
the
average
stout
hound
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
tiny
brown
head
smells
of
coffee
and
slight
chocolate
tastes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
slight
vanilla
taste
intermixed
beer
is
carbonated
correctly
and
goes
down
smooth
with
its
medium
body
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
edit
i
do
realize
that
some
beers
especially
stouts
may
have
some
yeast
in
them
but
this
was
solid
thick
and
absolutely
coating
the
bottle
very
unappealing
the
taste
just
flat
great
dry
chocolate
notes
malt
and
smoky
coffee
flavors
fill
the
mouth
crackery
crust
and
dry
grain
ease
to
the
back
of
a
flavorful
stout
for
as
thick
and
viscous
as
it
pours
the
feel
is
rather
thin
but
it
doesnt
draw
away
from
a
simply
well
done
beer
this
one
surprised
me
a
bit
it
has
all
the
flavor
of
a
fullon
russian
imperial
but
with
the
body
and
alcohol
content
youd
expect
of
a
more
typical
stout
pours
very
dark
i
expect
there
is
some
solids
present
here
as
well
not
much
head
aroma
of
what
else
roasted
barley
very
full
flavor
roasted
barley
and
coffee
intense
how
they
got
this
much
flavor
into
a
fairly
lightbodied
brew
i
can
only
guess
i
poured
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
and
was
impressed
with
the
dark
beautiful
brown
pour
with
a
beautiful
dark
brown
head
and
i
generally
dont
care
about
the
head
but
this
one
is
really
good
looking
this
is
a
dark
beer
very
tough
to
get
any
light
through
it
a
nice
chocolately
malty
scent
that
is
just
right
everything
about
this
beer
is
tempting
poured
it
looked
at
it
smelled
it
and
was
dying
to
taste
it
this
is
what
beer
drinking
is
about
a
percentage
point
or
two
of
alcohol
higher
would
of
made
this
a
total
winner
but
whos
to
complain
i
guess
ill
just
have
to
drink
more
than
one
aftertaste
lingers
a
bit
longer
than
i
would
like
and
gets
a
bit
sour
on
the
tongue
but
the
taste
is
good
enough
to
sustain
the
linger
well
worth
the
price
o
this
beer
is
very
flavorful
and
nice
and
easy
to
drink
it
seems
to
have
a
very
good
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
overall
for
something
i
just
randomly
found
at
my
corner
market
this
was
a
treat
its
a
great
beer
to
have
around
not
as
complex
as
some
other
stouts
but
certainly
a
step
above
the
common
ones
had
again
in
march
2013
much
better
roasty
full
bodied
and
dry
pretty
decent
stout
o
a
fantastic
stout
very
well
balanced
with
roasted
malts
dark
chocolatecoffee
and
citrusy
pop
of
hops
oh
so
drinkable
a
very
tasty
offering
this
is
a
damn
good
stout
its
intensely
flavorful
but
also
easy
to
drink
i
was
really
impressed
by
the
intense
chocolate
notes
throughout
this
is
definitely
a
refreshing
stout
that
i
would
have
again
o
i
really
like
this
beer
balanced
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
if
you
like
this
you
should
also
try
the
8
ball
stout
from
lost
coast
pair
with
a
symphony
charles
ives
symphony
1
this
is
an
extremely
unique
thick
fullbodied
rich
stout
the
way
a
stout
should
be
when
one
decants
a
steelhead
a
thick
layer
of
goodness
can
be
seen
on
the
bottom
of
each
bottle
we
have
found
that
the
beer
becomes
even
more
complex
if
such
a
thing
could
be
possible
given
the
unbelieveable
depth
of
this
brew
if
we
decant
11
oz
then
swirl
the
final
ounce
around
to
loosen
the
sediment
before
pouring
the
last
bit
this
also
serves
to
create
a
beautiful
thick
rich
dark
brown
head
i
would
have
this
one
again
and
i
recommend
that
you
try
it
if
you
havent
already
o
i
like
it
a
good
deal
but
i
dont
love
it
a
textbook
example
of
a
fallback
stout
when
little
else
is
available
but
its
a
great
choice
to
fill
out
a
mixed
6
pack
with
overall
a
well
done
american
stout
looking
at
others
reviews
i
am
baffled
to
see
people
rave
about
the
mouthfeel
ive
seen
stranger
things
when
it
comes
to
beer
though
i
doubt
ill
come
across
this
one
again
to
retry
it
but
you
never
know
overall
a
great
american
stout
flavorful
aggressive
yet
goes
down
with
grade
a
smoothness
sweet
with
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
to
balance
things
out
this
is
not
one
ill
quickly
forget
o
an
impressive
stout
in
a
small
package
cant
beat
that
id
gladly
have
multiple
bottles
with
dinner
sometime
or
just
on
a
cold
night
pours
black
with
an
effervescent
mocha
head
and
nice
lacing
a
nice
rich
roasty
aroma
with
some
chocolate
and
coffee
a
roasty
flavor
that
dies
just
before
it
reaches
burntness
some
licorice
and
coffee
thinnish
medium
mouthfeel
some
activiy
nothing
noticeable
overall
a
solid
stout
drinking
an
yeti
espresso
stout
before
this
wasnt
helpful
to
this
beers
cause
but
i
did
enjoy
this
and
will
have
to
revisit
it
with
a
fresher
palate
overall
this
extra
stout
tastes
great
the
wonderful
flavor
complexities
make
for
an
interesting
and
very
enjoyable
beer
i
feel
some
of
the
flavors
could
have
been
drawn
out
even
more
and
the
feel
could
be
creamier
but
these
are
nit
picky
things
definitely
have
this
if
you
can
o
i
honestly
didnt
expect
a
whole
lot
from
this
beer
but
was
quite
impressed
the
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
are
great
and
the
thick
mouthfeel
works
well
with
the
stout
o
a
really
fine
stout
have
been
enjoying
this
six
pack
for
the
last
few
days
and
will
need
to
try
their
other
beers
which
have
just
arrived
in
town
well
done
indeed
yeah
a
lovely
stout
here
pours
a
sensational
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
thick
creamy
milkshakey
mocha
head
smells
like
a
cup
o
joe
but
also
with
some
nice
roasty
dark
malts
and
a
bit
of
cocoa
flavor
is
similar
plenty
of
dark
malts
and
a
mild
espresso
flavor
feel
is
excellent
rich
and
creamy
without
being
filling
on
a
plenty
full
body
this
is
a
great
stout
and
possibly
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
mad
river
save
the
scotch
porter
which
border
epic
this
is
a
sessionable
one
too
good
before
or
after
dinner
and
different
than
most
a
winner
o
a
pleasant
surprise
i
dont
get
many
plain
stouts
that
have
the
depth
of
flavor
this
showed
will
be
a
go
to
stout
for
me
when
im
not
in
the
mood
for
a
bigger
ris
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
stout
and
glad
i
tried
it
has
all
the
makings
of
a
good
sessions
beer
oreally
good
this
is
very
well
balanced
a
bit
light
feeling
but
very
very
good
flavor
o
overall
a
really
nice
smooth
stout
nothing
really
stood
out
but
a
good
brew
none
the
less
o
everything
an
extra
stout
should
be
definitely
different
taste
than
expected
given
the
aroma
lots
of
american
hop
influence
and
a
decent
stout
base
odridiculous
deal
4
99
a
sixpack
this
is
actually
a
very
good
stout
a
great
nonimperialdouble
stout
no
glaring
flaws
a
textbook
stout
with
nothing
to
complain
about
overall
this
could
easily
become
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
under
7
abv
i
will
seek
this
one
out
again
this
is
exactly
what
a
stout
should
taste
like
well
done
mad
river
you
have
a
new
east
coast
fan
holy
cow
this
is
good
this
is
a
very
dark
appearing
ale
it
almost
looks
black
it
has
a
wonderful
malty
aroma
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
flavor
was
the
most
distinctive
thing
about
it
it
starts
with
an
almost
coffee
flavor
then
moves
on
to
a
chocolate
aftertaste
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
and
i
can
almost
picture
this
with
a
scoop
of
vanilla
ice
cream
like
a
root
beer
float
o
an
exceptional
and
very
flavorful
stout
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
2
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
random
dots
and
streaks
of
foam
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
malt
balls
and
cocoa
powder
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
dark
cocoa
powder
and
some
slight
coffee
flavors
there
is
a
nice
roasty
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
yet
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
with
a
very
nice
balance
in
the
smell
and
flavor
a
nice
stout
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
but
could
definitely
drink
another
bottle
o
this
is
an
awesome
stout
i
just
want
to
keep
on
sipping
this
stuff
so
the
flavor
is
always
in
my
mouth
i
will
be
having
another
tonight
a
truly
awesome
beer
i
love
stouts
and
this
one
really
hits
the
spot
o
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
style
but
its
enjoyable
this
is
a
hard
style
to
stand
out
in
and
this
does
it
by
taking
me
off
guard
of
my
original
assumption
though
it
may
not
be
amongst
my
top
stouts
it
has
left
its
mark
sure
if
my
options
are
limited
and
if
its
set
at
the
right
price
i
would
buy
again
and
share
with
friends
overall
an
ok
stout
worth
a
try
but
i
wont
pick
it
up
again
i
think
this
is
a
good
solid
brew
exemplary
of
its
type
and
recommend
this
beer
was
creamy
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
was
actually
expecting
this
beer
to
a
little
heavier
than
what
it
actually
was
in
fact
i
think
i
drank
it
a
little
too
fast
and
didnt
give
it
a
chance
to
warm
up
my
only
complaint
about
this
beer
is
that
i
wish
the
abv
was
a
bit
higher
i
like
my
stouts
to
be
in
the
911
range
but
overall
i
cant
complain
at
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
i
would
probably
have
had
another
one
if
it
werent
for
all
of
the
other
beers
that
were
calling
my
name
at
buckeye
oa
good
solid
american
stout
that
i
enjoyed
and
would
have
again
overall
this
is
a
must
try
brew
if
you
havent
already
indulged
i
would
have
no
issue
with
trying
this
one
again
as
it
went
down
quite
nicely
and
really
left
a
soft
sweet
note
in
the
end
very
well
done
not
as
viscous
as
i
initially
thought
it
would
be
but
still
decent
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
overall
while
i
dig
the
flavor
i
dont
dig
the
body
and
this
beer
is
a
ltttle
pricey
to
boot
would
rather
have
a
sn
stout
or
founders
porter
poured
out
an
oily
black
whit
a
slight
amount
of
head
that
quickly
went
away
a
bite
of
bitter
bakers
chocolate
in
the
nose
with
a
lot
of
booze
as
well
the
taste
is
smoother
than
expected
but
it
still
has
a
sharp
bite
that
has
a
pungent
bourbon
alcohol
aftertaste
i
was
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
brown
head
in
the
aroma
big
roasted
malt
and
sweet
notes
are
in
there
too
in
the
taste
dry
coffee
and
a
big
roasted
maltiness
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
to
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
coffee
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
nice
coffee
note
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
thick
oily
black
small
brown
colored
head
and
little
in
the
way
of
lace
or
retention
aroma
of
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
some
smoke
in
the
flavor
black
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
moderately
sweet
with
little
to
no
alcohol
presence
smooth
and
full
bodied
a
nice
sessionable
stout
with
a
moderate
abv
quite
tasty
cheers
a
brown
head
over
an
opaque

reasonable
carbonation
and

dark

character
in
the
aroma
good
chocolate
essence
maybe
a
hint
of
yeast
to
the
smell
as
well
taste
is
similar
to
smells
dark
malt
flavors
and
a
bitterness
that
reminds
me
of
strong
coffee
acidic
dark
malts
are
smoothed
out
by
thick

and

pretty
thick
and

body
very
filling
while
still
maintaining
6
6
abv
decent
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
personally
but
a
good
brew
with
exciting
flavors
i
enjoyed
it
overall
i
liked
this
its
a
nice
departure
from
the
traditional
american
stout
a
solid
pickup
ddefinitely
not
my
kind
of
stout
very
acridlike
roast
notes
make
this
one
not
very
palatable
to
me
pours
nearly
black
opaque
and
thick
with
a
coffeecolored
onefinger
head
smell
is
mostly
roasted
malt
with
coffee
notes
but
not
a
ton
of
complexity
taste
is
delicious
straightforward
and
just
what
i
want
from
a
stout
malty
strong
coffee
flavors
some
sweetness
and
nicely
rounded
mouthfeel
is
mediumthick
but
bubbly
has
a
bit
of
the
stout
syrupy
texture
but
enough
carbonation
to
balance
it
overall
quite
good
the
only
thing
holding
it
back
from
an
even
higher
rating
is
the
lack
of
complexity
to
the
flavor
quite
drinkable
maybe
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
for
great
drinkability
d
very
good
drinkability
fairly
average
abv
so
no
alcohol
noticeable
but
very
smooth
and
inviting
beer
slightly
sweeter
than
i
would
prefer
but
still
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
get
again
d
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
it
goes
down
like
a
9
or
10
imperial
which
is
to
say
that
the
flavors
and
whatnot
are
very
intense
a
very
tasty
stout
that
looks
amazing
and
lives
up
to
the
complexities
and
appearance
of
some
imperials
i
have
had
flavors
may
be
too
strong
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
all
in
all
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
and
definitely
my
favorite
from
the
west
coast
very
drinkable
very
sessionable
not
a
great
stout
but
it
will
do
a
good
flavorful
stout
heavy
enough
to
be
leaning
towards
the
desert
side
of
things
ive
had
better
i
think
the
carbonation
and
lack
of
body
hurt
this
one
for
me
taste
hoppy
for
a
stout
bitter
chocolate
malt
not
super
thick
but
not
thin
either
may
have
a
very
slight
amount
of
very
weak
coffee
or
it
could
be
the
bitterness
making
me
think
that
smoky
at
times
in
a
minimized
way
not
a
bad
beer
all
around
tends
to
tail
off
just
a
tad
a
good
beer
from
a
good
brewery
dpretty
drinkable
but
lacking
a
little
in
the
flavor
dosnt
really
stand
out
no
freshness
date
so
im
not
sure
how
fresh
this
is
would
definitely
give
it
another
go
d
wow
they
make
some
great
ca
beers
this
is
the
third
beer
this
brewery
has
impressed
me
with
an
a
couple
of
places
carrying
this
i
may
happen
on
a
case
on
of
the
best
stouts
i
ever
had
a
very
nice
stout
nonetheless
im
not
sure
ive
had
a
better
nonimperial
american
stout
this
is
very
tasty
with
some
genuinely
pleasant
and
genuinely
robust
characters
and
the
lightness
means
it
goes
down
very
easily
good
drop
of
beer
db
not
a
bad
stout
at
all
the
flavor
ends
up
being
pretty
balanced
and
well
crafted
no
complaints
here
except
for
the
sharp
dark
fruit
aroma
aroma
is
strong
and
nosefilling
rich
oily
and
smoky
with
a
firm
overtone
of
molasses
what
i
expect
from
a
quality
stout
it
pours
a
deep
opaque
sable
a
whisker
above
black
with
a
fairly
thick
and
finebubbled
light
tan
head
perky
flavor
is
smoky
and
malty
with
tones
of
quality
roast
coffee
and
molasses
slightly
sweet
and
smoky
texture
is
smooth
yet
fairly
fizzy
leaving
a
subtle
tingle
d
solid
stout
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
many
down
the
road
not
the
best
in
category
but
overall
very
good
mad
river
nailed
this
one
a
stoutlovers
stout
with
the
imperialdouble
stouts
getting
all
of
the
hype
beers
like
this
just
dont
get
enough
attention
this
one
is
a
must
overall
a
very
tasty
stout
thats
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
rich
flavor
and
easy
drinkability
make
it
a
winner
if
youre
seeking
a
more
drinkable
beer
with
a
big

body
is
mediumfull
and
extremely

the

with

drinkability
generous

well
balanced
tasty
stout
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
dangerously
so
i
had
two
of
these
coupled
with
another
beer
and
i
am
feeling
the
effects
of
three
straight
6
beers
definitely
worth
trying
a
six
of
excellent
stout
nice
aroma
good
flavor
the
smell
was
a
great
balance
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
even
better
im
a
tough
grader
on
stouts
and
this
was
a
great
american
stout
a
nice
smokey
taste
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweet
chocolately
goodness
very
smooth
to
drink
i
would
love
to
have
these
on
a
nice
fall
day
very
nice
stout
as
good
as
any
great
flavor
and
aroma
i
have
a
local
specialty
shop
that
carries
this
just
for
me
now
there
are
more
and
more
folks
picking
it
up
it
is
just
the
right
balance
of
malt
and
abv
the
appearance
is
exceptional
and
the
smell
draws
you
in
the
flavor
is
full
and
satisfying
it
is
a
bit
costly
but
worth
it
if
you
like
a
big
stout
one
super
solid
stout
drinkable
by
many
theres
so
many
average
to
ok
regular
american
stouts
out
there
and
mad
rivers
steelhead
is
an
entire
step
if
not
more
than
a
few
above
most
of
them
d
multiple
bottles
are
possible
highly
recommended
d
a
beautiful
beer
reminds
me
why
i
love
beer
well
done
in
summary
this
brew
is
incredible
i
had
this
one
along
time
ago
on
a
buisness
trip
to
talahassee
there
i
was
at
the
abc
and
i
thought
i
would
do
a
little
mix
and
match
action
so
i
picked
it
up
once
i
got
back
to
the
hotel
room
poured
it
and
took
a
sip
i
knew
this
was
a
first
class
stout
unfortunatly
i
havent
been
able
to
pick
one
up
since
as
they
seem
to
be
pretty
rare
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
though
as
fate
would
have
it
i
found
one
peaking
out
of
the
dusty
shelves
at
the
local
total
wines
and
spirits
once
it
caught
my
eye
it
was
in
the
cart
the
body
is
nothing
short
of
full
very
syrupy
anticipated
by
how
it
poured
feel
and
mild
carbonation
a
sipper
for
sure
notes
a
solid
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
it
is
true
to
type
and
just
smacks
you
around
hard
to
explain
but
i
like
this
one
not
my
favorite
stout
but
very
solid
fairly
sweet
so
it
is
great
for
a
beer
after
dinner
or
sometime
late
at
night
d
my
overall
impression
of
the
beer
is
that
its
more
of
a
dessert
stout
than
anything
else
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
without
food
but
i
would
of
liked
it
a
bit
more
robust
with
more
malty
flavors
instead
of
a
dominate
chocolate
syrup
kinda
thing
not
worth
seeking
out
to
me
but
worth
a
try
if
you
like
dessert
stouts
i
think
this
one
needed
a
bit
more
though
this
beer
must
fly
under
the
radar
as
im
surprised
there
is
not
more
buzz
about
this
very
welldone
stout
that
lands
firmly
in
the
american
stout
category
nice
mocha
head
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramel
no
over
the
top
chocolate
or
coffee
flavors
just
straight
forward
big
stout
slightly
sweet
and
with
a
clean
finish
will
see
more
of
my
beer
fridge
d
i
like
it
d
because
it
was
light
and
not
over
the
top
in
any
one
of
the
above
taste
i
think
that
i
would
be
able
to
drink
two
or
three
of
these
in
one
sitting
before
i
change
it
up
a
good
not
great
stout
not
as
well
balanced
as
i
would
have
liked
d
not
too
strong
pretty
easy
to
drink
though
thick
a
solid
beer
overall
not
my
top
stout
but
if
i
had
no
other
choice
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
overall
easy
to
drink
not
too
much
booze
to
even
notice
great
american
stout
wish
i
tried
this
sooner
buy
this
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
like
a
good
stout
everything
with
this
beer
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
run
out
an
get
this
one
d
very
drinkable
considering
its
body
and
complex
flavors
this
beer
grows
on
me
with
every
sip
very
tasty
d
fairly
drinkable
but
the
light
mouthfeel
ruins
it
for
me
d
very
drinkable
suffers
from
the
light
mouthfeel
but
still
good
not
running
back
to
this
one
with
the
mediumlight
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
loaded
with
tons
of
flavor
im
glad
it
was
recommended
to
me
when
i
was
otherwise
occupied
with
russian
imperial
stouts
american
stouts
are
a
whole
new
category
for
me
and
im
liking
them
as
much
as
the
robust
porters
ive
been
trying
too
highly
recommended
by
me
now
as
well
d
a
nice
creamy
stout
lots
of
chocolate
flavor
with
significant
spice
notes
that
are
reinforced
by
the
herbal
hops
very
rich
and
somewhat
sweet
for
the
style
it
has
a
surprising
level
of
complexity
so
far
i
have
been
surprised
by
the
quality
of
mad
rivers
brews
and
this
stout
is
no
exception
highly
recommended
d
very
sessionable
this
is
only
available
in
one
shop
around
here
that
ive
found
so
ill
be
stopping
by
there

with

in

than
sooner
it
starts
to
slowly

a

is
complex
with
caramel

eathy
hops
black
licorice
stale
coffee
and
burnt

which
all
blend
to

perfection
tastes
of

with
a
good
addition
of
hops
right

for
more
near

in
the

department
goes

i
had
no

pretty
black
dark

dark

sweet

but
the

is
light
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
would
have
been
a
lot
better
with
some
proper
heft
to
it
thanks
russ
drinkability
is
to
the
sky
with
this
brew
i
can
down
a
few
of
these
in
the
winter
months
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
was
my
first
beer
from
mad
river
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
there
other
beers
wonderful
viscous
feel
omits
a
very
warming
burn
but
at
the
same
time
i
cant
stop
drinking
it
this
beer
is
fullbodied
and
viscous
but
it
finishes
with
only
a
light
sweetness
that
keeps
it
amazingly
drinkable
a
stout
that
i
will
be
sure
to
have
on
hand
more
often
especially
as
fall
turns
into
winter
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
notes
besides
the
wet
cardboard
and
slightly
burnt
malts
this
is
a
pretty
darn
good
stout
ive
been
really
impressed
with
the
other
steelhead
offerings
that
i
have
had
scotch
porter
double
ipa
and
this
one
is
no
different
i
would
love
to
buy
a
fresh
six
pack
of
this
and
session
the
unoxidized
version
it
speaks
volumes
about
this
beer
when
even
an
oxidized
bottle
gets
high
marks
recommended
drinkability
very
flavorful
with
a
lot
to
commend
itself
this
is
a
great
stout
huge
robust
hearty
bold
and
fullflavored
the
tendency
is
toward
astringency
and
it
would
take
just
so
little
more
complexity
to
put
it
to
an
a
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
me
are
a
stout
person
d
this
did
not
look
impressive
but
really
delivered
with
great
flavor
drinkability
overall
its
a
pleasant
quaffable
fairly
solid
stout
d
at

this
is
a
very
big
dry
stout
ba
calls
this
an
american
stout
which
it
is
but
the
flavor
wateriness
and
dry
finish
remind
me
a
lot
more
of
an
irish
dry
stout
than
a
traditional
american
stout
my
go
to
example
of
that
is
either
shakespeare
fro
rogue
or
sierra
nevada
stout
pours
an
ink
black
color
with
a
quickly
fading
highly
carbonated
looking
dark
tan
head
i
literally
watched
the
head
disappear
before
my
eyes
more
quickly
than
any
i
can
remember
a
nice
aroma
of
chocolate
malts
in
the
nose
coffee
hints
in
the
background
definitely
an
appetizing
smelling
stout
in
the
classic
sense
just
strong
dark
malt
taste
is
even
better
extremely
strong
chocolate
flavor
but
a
purely
malt
based
chocolate
the
flavor
does
not
end
there
as
coffee
and
a
slight
bitterness
add
a
nice
blend
to
the
backend
of
the
flavor
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
without
any
alcohol
heat
makes
this
a
highly
drinkable
stout
i
am
surprised
that
much
flavor
comes
from
a
standard
stout
it
is
an
incredibly
well
built
beer
drinkability
definitely
killin
this
growler
always
one
to
switch
things
up
so
im
sure
itll
be
some
time
before
i
grab
this
one
again
definitely
drinkable
and
a
great
stout
for
a
non
highgravity
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
good
carbonation
also
after
i
poured
the
bottles
contents
i
noticed
that
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
was
coated
in
something
which
i
am
assuming
is
lactose
but
either
way
it
contained
what
seems
to
be
coffee
grinds
pretty
nice
touch
on
a
nice
beer
poured
from
a
stubby
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
stout
appears
a
dark
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
rather
dense
ecru
foam
the
head
lingers
for
a
bit
before
settling
to
a
thin
layer
smells
and
tastes
of
medium
roasted
grains
bittersweet
chocolate
mild
coffee
notes
sweet
malt
mocha
bordering
on

nice

some

dark

out

a
touch
of
coffee

dark

nice
thick
and

this
was
a
nice
extra
stout
and
i
could
certainly
drink
this
again
if
it
ever
became
available

me

six

for

poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
extremely
dark
brown
thick
brown
head
decent
lacing
smelled
like
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
taste
caught
me
off
guard
it
was
so
good
not
expecting
that
from
a
ten
buck
six
pack
man
that
was
great
really
rich
and
creamy
chocolate
mixed
with
a
nice
subtle
coffee
flavor
perfect
balance
of
flavor
and
roasted
barley
thick
and
chewy
in
the
mouth
but
easy
to
drink
even
more
flavor
erupted
as
it
warmed
to
room
temp
could
sit
all
night
and
enjoy
one
or
have
a
couple
because
the
flavor
was
so
good
and
it
was
so
easy
to
drink
ive
had
one
or
two
other
mad
rivers
brews
in
the
past
but
i
am
going
to
keep
my
eyes
open
for
more
based
on
the
overall
strength
of
this
beer
a
great
stout
pours
a
dark
black
color
14
inch
head
of
a
dark
tan
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
strongly
of
roasted
malt
slight
alcohol
and
some
sweet
malt
as
well
fits
the
style
of
an
american
stout
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
low
carbonation
level
a
strong
dryness
is
associated
with
this
brew
tastes
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
some
hop
background
slight
biscuit
flavors
and
some
alcohol
throughout
overall
a
good
blend
of
flavors
strong
palate
and
a
good
drinkability
d
im
very
impressed
by
this
beer
my
first
from
mad
river
they
really
get
the
job
done
with
what
is
an
aggressive
yet
drinkable
stout
ill
be
picking
this
up
in
the
future
for
sure
not
bad
but
too
ashydusty
and
the
slight
sourtart
throws
it
off
a
bit
for
too
much
despite
that
there
is
a
smoothness
and
enough
taste
that
it
drinks
well
enough
mouthfeel
was
a
little
light
for
my
liking
not
standing
up
to
the
strong
flavors
and
aromas
of
the
beer
the
middle
was
especially
flat
with
a
body
lacking
the
ability
to
carry
the
beer
around
the
mouth
or
compliment
its
character
the
drinkability
is
also
low
because
of
this
but
otherwise
this
is
a
nice
strong
example
of
the
style
and
something
id
pick
up
again
on
occasion
all
in
all
not
a
bad
stout
id
consider
drinking
it
again
and
id
definitely
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
nothing
amazingly
memorable
and
the
price
is
just
a
smidgen
high
for
something
unmemorable
but
all
in
all
a
nice
roasty
stout
one
of
the
darker
brown
heads
youll
find
good
two
fingers
deep
and
quite
dense
and
reluctant
to
dissolve
quality
lacing
as
well
as
black
as
the
ace
of
spades
nary
a
hint
of
color
anywhere
naturally
it
is
fully
opaque
the
nose
is
perhaps
too
dense
itself
you
have
to
work
at
teasing
out
accents
of
milk
chocolate
mocha
powder
carob
coated
raisins
and
then
apricot
apple
fruit
scents
coffee
oddly
absent
for
all
of
its
maltiness
and
lack
of
hops
there
is
a
saline
metal
edge
to
it
before
it
dissolves
in
your
nostrils
fullbodied
and
bottom
heavy
in
spite
of
its
very
polished
and
round
mouth
feel
and
suave
carbonation
like
it
gets
to
the
party
and
plops
down
on
the
first
coach
it
sees
more
toast
than
roast
dark
chocolate
carob
licorice
green
coffee
bean
not
very
bready
maybe
raw
grain
or
meadow

traces
of

past

the
palate
dries
out
appreciably
you
can
feel
the
moisture
evacuate
while
more
or
less
monochrome
flavorwise
does
have
depth
and
not
difficult
to
drink
this
is
a
pretty
high
bodied
beer
very
heavy
drinkability
is
average
to
good
not
a
lot
of
directly
appealing
flavors
but
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
harshness
as
well
this
probably
could
have
been
rearranged
a
bit
into
a
nice
irish
stout
but
instead
it
turned
out
weird
drinkability
its
definitely
a
dessert
stout

itself

very

odors
with

flavor
are
excellent
but
what
makes
this
stand
out
is
one
of
the
best
palates
evey
feels
almost
rich
enough
to
eat
with
a
spoon
mad
river
does
not
get
a
lot
of
distribution
but
very
good
it
was
a
little
syrupy
but
had
a
strong
robust
mouthfeel
that
coated
nicely
drinkability
was
not
great
due
to
the
sweetness
i
usually
prefer
a
little
more
bitterness
in
extra
stoutse
g
coopers

very
enticing

leaves
just
enough
bitternees
to
perfectly
balance
this
beer

but
i
mean
that
in
the
best
way
possible
theres
nothing
surprising
or
original
here
but
what
is
there
is
all
about
mocha
java
leaning
more
heavily
on
the
chocolate
there
is
a
very
subtle
caramel
scent
it
tastes
of
coffee
but
this
is
an
ideal
blend
of
both
that
produces
a
solid
stout
aroma
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
full
bodied
appropriate
medium
carbonation
taste
features
a
full
onslaught
of
roasted
coffee
it
even
refreshed
dense
head
over
a
black
and
a
touch
of
espresso
chocolate
tasting
and
lightly
bitter
the
maltiness
is
heavy
and
the
tastes
a
little
like
wine
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
fabulous
stout
yet
creamy
finish
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
an
extremely
rich
black
and
chocolate
malt
flavor
that
is
very
thick
and
dry
it
goes
down
slow
and
finishes
with
a
bitter
black
malt
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
drinking
stout
it
has
a
little
lacking
in
the
mouthfeel
department
as
well
as
a
little
too
intense
in
the
grain
bill

o
i
accidentally
aged
this
one
that
got
lost
in
the
back
of
the
cellar
but
it
ages
gracefully
all
of
the
flavors
are
meshed
and
mellow

stuff

burned
chocolate

very
poor
example
of
a

thick
coffee
aroma
full
bodied
roasted
coffee
beans
heavy
chocolate
and
a
little
bitter
easily
the
worst
stout
ive
ever
had
some
guy
at
a
local
beer
store
recommended
it
to
me
over
the
left
hand
milk
stout
what
a
poor
brew
the
taste
was
bland
and
it
took
forever
to
drink
one
beer
took
me
about
45
minutes
to
suffer
through
im
a
big
fan
of
bells
brewery
but
this
beer
is
simply
pathetic
i
would
suggest
avoiding
this
beer
at
all
costs
its
simply
not
worth
the
time
to
drink
it
or
the
money
to
pay
for
it
tasted
from
a
12
oz
bottle
on
march
29
2015
just
ok
disappointed
thought
it
would
be
more
like
muddy
little
bitter
taste
dry
and
nicely
crispy
roasted
malt
some
hot
alcohol
at
the
end
a
little
smoke
in
the
middle
thick
dark
grainy
and
somewhat
smokey
with
a
definite
hop
presence
the
vegetal
smell
seems
a
little
off
a
perfect
example
of
the
nonbarrel
aged
nonimperial
american
stout
the
thing
thats
great
about
this
beer
is
that
it
lacks
a
gimmick
and
doesnt
try
to
do
anything
that
takes
it
away
from
being
a
great
stout
the
roasty
burnt
finish
is
divine
o
this
is
a
nice
everyday
stout
something
i
could
drink
regularly
it
has
a
nice
mellow
coffee
dark
chocolate
bitterness
up
front
some
roasted
malt
flavors
in
the
middle
a
semi
dry
finish
definitely
drinkable
worth
a
try
if
you
love
stouts
but
the
price
might
keep
me
away
as
i
can
get
a
stout
just
as
good
for
less
than
10
a
sixpack
compared
to
that
was
well
over
10
for
the
sixpack
yeah
i
gave
it
a
5
in
look
its
beautiful
most
beer
is
the
flavor
is
nice
but
for
some
reason
seems
thin
at
the
end
but
its
good
nonetheless
like
some
of
their
other
stuff
this
is
an
easy
going
brew
reminds
me
of
modern
times
stuff
in
the
way
it
appeals
across
the
ranks
although
modern
times
is
quickly
turning
on
my
palate
due
to
the
ultra
sweet
malts
and
flavors
all
their
brews
have
sorry
to
get
off
track
this
one
is
very
good
perfect
blend
of
roasted
grains
coffee
molasses
and
chocolate
in
a
stout
handsdown
this
would
be
one
of
my
top
choices
for
an
everyday
stout
if
only
it
didnt
cost
north
of
13
bucks
a
6
pack
just
an
average
stout
expected
morevery
little
coffee
and
licorice
disappointing
this
was
a
decent
beer
overall
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
typically
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
thin
watery
terrible
body
no
interesting
tastes
just
bland
nothingness
barely
any
smell
this
is
an
awful
stout
very
average
beer
not
great
not
bad
pours
a
deep
black
with
khaki
colored
head
coffee
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
some
nice
molasses
notes
on
the

the

with
some

more

and
chocolate
roasty

after

good
body
postscript
note
the
bottled
date
on
the
beer
was
21813
and
i
drank
this
beer
on
21714
which
if
my
math
is
correct
and
i
was
never
good
at
math
but
i
can
do
this
math
the
beer
was
almost
a
year
old
to
the
day
if
this
lower
abv
beer
was
this
good
aged
accidently
almost
to
a
year
to
the
day
i
have
to
try
a
more
fresh
bottle
to
see
if
its
better
that
being
said
if
you
happen
upon
an
older
bottle
of
this
beer
up
to
and
including
a
year
old
though
maybe
even
older
would
be
good
too
dont
worry
youll
enjoy
it
flavor
is
rich
and
roasty
with
a
charred
character
hitting
mid
palate
and
carrying
into
the
finish
where
theres
a
slightly
sweet
reprise
of
chocolate
nutty
malt
offers
strong
support
a
little
more
charred
than
i
care
for
dark
cherry
emerges
as
it
warms
the
nose
is
toffee
and
cocoa
with
a
sniff
of
drip
coffee
perfectly
carbonated
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
the
liquorice
back
end
dances
with
your
tastebuds
and
gives
this
an
extra
element
that
elevates
the
beer
to
another
level
fantastic
not
bad
but
flavor
seems
a
bit
weird
better
stouts
are
out
there
extremely
light
bodied
for
a
stout
carbonation
was
fine
not
bad
a
little
disappointed
with
bells
lately
kalamazoo
needs
a
little
something
more
to
be
better
then
just
above
average
i
dont
really
pick
up
the
licorice
but
i
do
get
a
nice
amount
of
dark
coco
i
would
drink
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
search
for
it
overall

this
is
just
a
good
ol
standard
stout
nothing
more
or
less
it
has
a
good
chocolate
presence
with
a
hefty
amount
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
character
with
undertones
of
smoke
and
licorice
it
wont
knock
ur
socks
off
but
it
does
hit
the
spot
pretty
good
not
my
favorite
but
much
better
than
the
dagger
stout
i
had
sampled
same
trip
to
bells
it
tastes
like
black
licorice
but
not
in
a
way
that
makes
you
say
aw
shit
no
one
likes
black
licorice
its
good
the
smell
made
my
mouth
water
and
want
a
drink
the
first
drink
was
fantastic
the
flavor
was
deep
and
rich
it
has
a
slight
bite
very
slight
i
its
a
great
beer
i
have
had
better
stouts
like
left
hand
brewing
companies
nitro
but
that
being
said
this
is
still
a
fantastic
beer
o
a
greatlooking
stout
which
is
a
little
lighter
bodied
than
some
but
tasty
pours
an
almostblack
deep
brown
theres
a
thinish
mediumlight
tan
head
that
mostly
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
some
nice
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
roasted
notes
with
a
little
alcohol
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
good
but
not
particularly
complex
with
a
deeper
roasted
tone
and
maybe
a
hint
of
chicory
the
body
is
thinner
and
smooth
o
a
terrific
sipper
great
with
cheddar
cheese
or
something
chocolate
o
drink
ability
is
high
flavor
is
well
balanced
definitely
a
stout
i
will
search
for
when
craving
one
cheers
overall
i
can
hardly
imagine
a
better
stout
i
feel
like
i
could
just
knock
these
back
one
right
after
the
other
and
with
the
relatively
low
abv
i
probably
could
absolutely
perfect
flavors
and
feeling
they
really

rich

it

not

fan
but
this
is

an

beer
the
best

ive
had
in

poured
with

with
maybe
a
little

too
smells

taste
coffee
flavor
is
very

almost
too
strong
pleasing
taste
overall
perhaps
not
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
though
overall
i
really
liked
this
stout
nicely
balanced
flavor
and
attenuation
very
enjoyable
decent
beer
a
light
stout
with
a
beautiful
color
and
ample
head
the
bitterness
and
sweetness
do
blend
together
weel
to
give
a
nice
balanced
flavor
overall
not
as
strong
as
i
expected
band
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewery
m
very
smooth
and
creamy
o
a
good
beer
with
some
flaws
enjoyed
the
flavor
but
it
was
rather
simplistic
overall
i
have
a
new
favorite
beer
taste
is
bitter
coffee
and
chocolate
with
sweet
fig
and
plumb
notes
it
has
a
very
thick
mouth
feel
with
a
nice
bitter
roasted
malt
caramelized
notes
this
a
a
stout
with
big
dark
flavors
yet
ii
is
surprisingly
drinkable
with
a
modest
6
abv
overall
im
liking
this
stout
much
more
than
i
anticipated
unsure
as
to
why
the
ratings
arent
higher
o
not
my
favorite
from
bells
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
overall
very
roasty
intense
and
flavorful
o
this
is
a
bold
and
superb
stout
lots
of
robust
flavors
great
balance
and
superb
drinkability
something
i
would
easily
drink
again
one
gripe
i
have
is
the
weaker
than
expected
mouthfeel
the
lacking
mouthfeel
is
the
one
missing
facet
is
an
otherwise
excellent
beer
recommended
overall
solid
stout
from
michigan
this
brewery
puts
out
some
stellar
beers
o
the
word
licorice
in
the
description
scared
me
i
hate
licorice
but
there
are
no
discernible
licorice
flavors
in
the
beer
i
mark
that
as
a
big
plus
very
nice
roast
flavor
with
a
modest
6
0
abv
there
are
not
a
lot
of
complexities
of
chocolate
and
coffee
but
this
is
still
a
well
made
and
good
tasting
stout
cheers
overall
i
like
the
balance
and
touch
of
licorice
in
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
cloying
but
does
not
distract
from
the
overall
beer
a
sessionable
brew
and
every
day
drinkable
great
job
bells
yesterday
was
a
very
brisk
day
for
may
so
i
wanted
a
beer
to
match
bells
kalamazoo
stout
didnt
disappoint
a
bold
fragrant
heavy
brew
that
matched
the
dark
overcast
day
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
loves
a
classic
dark
stout
this
stout
brewed
with
brewers
licorice
pours
black
with
a
very
small
tan
lots
of
lacing
after
each
sip
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
coffee
and
licorice
with
roasted
malt
very
nice
smell
of
the
mixed
flavors
lots
going
on
with
the
taste
as
would
be
expected
not
overpowering
though
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
very
pleasant
overall
and
would
rate
this
a
good
solid
8
if
not
a
8
5
o
its
pretty
good
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
that
is
really
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
makes
for
a
nice
drinker
body
is
just
thin
enough
make
it
easy
drinking
a
smooth
sipper
really
quite
enjoyable
o
a
very
enjoyable
and
moderately
complex
porter
overall
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
upfront
taste
but
then
it
comes
fairly
heavy
not
overwhelming
this
is
a
really
tasty
stout
but
if
i
had
one
complaint
it
would
be
that
the
aftertaste
builds
towards
bitterness
o
this
is
a
very
nice
lower
abv
stout
really
reminds
me
of
founders
porter
in
pretty
much
every
way
there
are
some
nice
qualities
that
you
usually
find
in
a
bigger
imperial
beer
o
well
brewed
amazing
appearance
but
too
one
sided
on
bitterness
and
dry
mouth
let
me
start
by
saying
that
this
is
my
go
to
stout
so
i
maybe
a
little
bit
partial
in
my
judgment
of
this
offering
it
pours
a
very
near
black
mahogany
with
a
small
tan
head
that
leaves
a
great
film
and
lacing
the
nose
is
a
robust
blend
of
coffee
chocolate
black
licorice
and
dried
fruit
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
yet
still
quite
light
for
a
stout
definitely
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
as
deep
and
complex
as
the
nose
with
the
addition
of
a
wonderful
tobacco
note
and
a
chewy
bitter
finish
that
lasts
long
after
last
sip
is
taken
sure
id
love
to
drink
founders
breakfast
stout
kbs
big
bad
baptist
or
black
note
every
day
but
its
not
available
everyday
nor
could
i
afford
it
so
i
settle
for
this
delicious
and
much
more
accessible
stout
pick
up
a
six
and
enjoy
very
full
bodied
with
complex
tastes
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
with
almost
a
hint
of
licorice
balances
the
significant
hop
presence
against
the
roast
malt
body
when
poured
offers
a
big
head
of
dark
beige
and
very
dark
brown
in
color
caramel
and
vanilla
undertones
as
well
solid
beer
o
slightly
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
a
really
distinct
flavour
but
this
is
going
up
on
the
list
of
allaround
favourite
stouts
o
i
like
it
not
even
close
to
some
of
bells
other
stuff
can
you
compare
anything
to
black
note
this
is
a
good
stout
im
very
fond
of
this
brewery
its
a
nice
deep
dark
color
cant
see
thru
it
a
thin
brown
head
kind
of
classic
of
a
stout
the
smell
is
pleasant
and
very
bold
tastes
of
rich
dark
malts
has
a
heavy
coffee
malt
flavor
for
me
its
surprisingly
dry
which
really
is
a
nice
addition
for
the
mouth
feel
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
its
the
first
ive
had
that
im
aware
of
brewed
with
brewers
licorice
i
cant
taste
it
and
i
do
enjoy
licorice
so
i
guess
im
slightly
disappointed
i
couldnt
pick
it
apart
in
that
regard
from
any
other
dark
stout
i
picked
it
out
thinking
it
would
be
a
bit
more
unique
but
if
youre
a
dark
beer
fan
chances
are
good
you
will
like
this
beer
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
bells
o
pretty
damn
good
overall
with
something
interesting
at
every
phase
of
the
experience
definitely
opens
into
a
different
place
upon
warmed
state
i
will
give
it
credit
for
the
better
drafts
and
bottles
ive
had
before
o
whatta
class
act
bells
has
proven
to
be
this
is
a
quality
stout
thatll
satisfy
most
fans
of
the
style
dark
ales
porters
and
the
like
licorice
is
showcased
quite
nicely
i
suppose
if
you
dislike
licorice
this
beer
may
not
strike
you
the
way
it
struck
me
i
will
try
some
more
of
bells
brewerys
offerings
since
i
have
heard
positive
comments
about
the
beers
but
do
not
believe
i
will
return
to
their
stout
do
a
very
balanced
drinkable
stout
the
chocolatecoffee
combo
grows
on
you
with
every
sip
this
is
a
fine
dark
beer
however
it
lacks
the
mystery
and
intrigue
i
was
seeking
on
a
dark
and
dreary
halloween
night
good
balance
between
coffee
bitterness
and
sweet
chocoaltiness
when
youre
a
jersey
kid
in
a
pa
bottle
shop
you
get
whatever
bells
has
i
only
got
two
actually
two
hearted
and
this
one
and
this
ones
a
pass
cant
say
im
blown
away
by
it
looking
forward
to
2
hearted
o
a
smooth
easy
drinking
stout
that
has
sweetness
and
lots
of
earthy
bitter
notes
to
round
out
the
taste
i
was
worried
at
first
because
im
not
a
fan
of
licorice
forward
beers
but
it
works
well
with
this
beer
and
compliments
nicely
a
great
stout
to
stock
up
on
perfectly
crafted
stout
likely
more
hoppy
than
it
feels
but
it
is
completely
balanced
by
its
bold
malt
profile
pours
a
used
motor
oil
black
that
i
cant
see
any
light
through
about
1
finger
of
a
brown
mocha
colored
frothy
head
that
dissapates
rather
quickly
leaving
good
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
straight
roasted
coffee
almost
a
milky
chocolate
lactose
type
note
to
the
smell
i
dont
detect
any
of
the
licorice
that
used
in
the
brewing
process
the
taste
is
pure
coffee
and
creamy
chocolate
nice
bitterness
roastyness
i
get
the
licorice
on
the
back
of
the
tounge
just
faintly
after
a
sip
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
this
beer
must
be
great
on
nitro
tap
if
thats
even
available
overall
a
damn
good
stout
definatly
something
id
pick
up
again
too
bad
the
abv
is
a
little
to
low
for
any
real
cellaring
cheers
drinkability
another
top
stout
without
too
much
abv
one
of
my
favorites
dark
brown
ale
with
a
slight
tan
head
has
a
roasty
aroma
and
a
slight
roasty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
smooth
and
has
a
nice
full
body
feel
nicely
balanced
this
is
a
beer
that
is
just
a
pure
joy
to
drink
on
any
occasion
nice
mouthfeel
medium
full
bodied
moderate
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
you
will
too
o
this
is
a
nice
mild
not
so
inyourface
but
definitely
flavorful
stout
i
generally
prefer
milk
chocolate
flavor
to
dark
chocolate
flavor
which
is
what
youll
find
in
this
beer
o
overall
bittersweet
with
a
tiny
hint
of
licorice
in
the
aftertaste
not
terribly
hoppy
if
at
all
darn
good
stout
i
would
certainly
try
this
again
o
a
very
nice
stout
highlighted
by
an
amazing
body
o
this
is
a
really
smooth
example
of
a
strong
american
stout
why
cant
imperials
be
this
good
if
youve
never
had
it
try
it
if
you
have
had
it
why
arent
you
drinking
it
now
overall
a
simple
wellcrafted
stout
by
an
excellent
brewery
it
is
flavorful
and
full
bodied
and
meets
all
the
criteria
you
would
like
for
in
a
regular
stout
seems
to
be
pitch
black
but
close
examination
shows
its
just
a
little
off
some
brown
hues
in
there
but
thick
and
completely
opaque
nice
light
brown
head
that
lingers
and
a
lace
that
clings
to
the
glass
nicely
nice
smoky
sweet
aroma
that
is
balanced
by
some
maltiness
and
clean
bitterness
in
the
nose
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
very
coffee
bitter
like
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
burnt
wood
flavors
some
deep
fruit
notes
like
raisins
or
plums
but
only
slight
there
is
a
little
hop
bitterness
that
hangs
out
on
your
mouth
with
the
burnt
flavors
to
make
a
very
pleasant
aftertaste
not
groundbreaking
in
my
opinion
but
a
solid
stout
overall
a
really
good
if
not
excellent
stout
while
the
aroma
is
lacking
a
bit
it
is
full
of
flavor
and
stops
short
of
being
over
the
top
remaining
quite
drinkable
very
nice
o
its
a
great
stout
with
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
that
work
well
together
its
a
great
winter
beer
so
i
picked
up
the
bells
kalamazoo
stout
without
really
checking
it
out
i
figured
its
cold
outside
a
stout
sounds
good
it
wasnt
till
i
got
home
that
i
realized
it
was
brewed
with
licorice
ive
been
a
huge
licorice
fan
since
my
childhood
it
poured
dark
and
silky
into
my
glass
a
nice
coffee
scent
with
just
a
hint
of
licorice
the
taste
was
the
same
with
very
light
carbonation
a
great
stout
i
will
definitely
get
this
beer
again
o
4
25
very
nice
beer
smooth
and
delicious
overall
this
is
a
very
good
stout
nicely
balanced
and
good
for
a
session
beer
ive
seen
this
one
on
draft
before
and
will
probably
try
it
on
draft
as
well
a
pretty
good
stout
middle
of
the
road
for
the
stouts
ive
enjoyed
od
a
pleasant
stout
great
drinkability
complex
for
its
strength
and
hits
all
the
requisite
notes
for
me
o
a
solid
stout
overall
just
not
my
favorite
out
there
one
of
the
great
stouts
of
the
midwest
this
is
a
real
winner
shiny
black
dense
to
light
and
sporting
a
lovely
just
off
white
head
over
an
inch
tall
full
of
air
and
leaving
plenty
of
lace
big
bitter
roast
barley
aromatics
with
just
enough
hops
smoke
wet
earth
and
acidic
coffee
all
contribute
to
the
nose
and
taste
of
this
beer
as
well
but
what
i
love
about
it
is
its
straightforward
nature
no
frills
just
good
roasty
stout
its
really
clean
for
the
style
finishing
quickly
and
not
drinking
too
heavy
at
all
kind
of
an
all
year
stout
rather
than
just
a
short
day
cold
weather
beer
its
not
overly
creamy
in
feel
either
with
a
slick
sort
of
coating
mouthfeel
thin
enough
to
drink
several
off
but
big
enough
to
satiate
me
after
that
many
sweet
in
the
middle
comes
out
of
nowhere
but
the
bitter
finish
triumphs
one
of
bells
less
exotic
but
most
trustworthy
beers
overall
this
stout
is
low
alcohol
6
0
but
its
a
formidable
beer
on
taste
alone
the
absence
of
coffee
and
the
presence
of
dark
chocolate
makes
this
a
memorable
beer
overall
a
nice
lighter
stout
not
super
unique
or
complex
but
very
well
done
the
beer
is
not
as
creamy
and
smooth
as
id
hope
for
but
its
enjoyable
a
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
regularly
although
i
think
my
local
stout
beats
it
not
my
thing
theres
a
lightness
to
the
mouthfeel
that
is
at
odds
with
the
overall
taste
kalamazoo
poured
a
gorgeous
creamy
2
finger
head
with
great
lacing
but
other
than
that
i
felt
the
other
factors
being
reviewed
were
too
subdued
for
my
taste
there
were
dark
fruits
a
little
coffee
chocolate
and
licorice
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
all
were
on
the
lighter
side
except
dark
fruity
sweetness
and
a
sourness
on
the
back
end
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
mouthfeel
was
light
with
little
carbonation
o
an
excellent
american
stout
that
balances
its
intended
flavors
very
well
without
overpowering
your
senses
this
is
a
beer
by
which
ive
long
been
intrigued
it
just
keeps
being
superceded
by
other
opportunities
i
found
a
single
on
sale
at
the
store
today
and
decided
to
pull
the
trigger
im
extremely
glad
i
did
i
would
consider
this
in
the
upper
tier
of
everyday
stouts
that
ive
had
its
got
a
good
reputation
and
its
one
that
is
well
earned
bells
continues
to
impress
me
and
having
only
recently
a
couple
of
months
ago
moved
to
within
their
distro
i
look
forward
to
the
continuing
education
in
their
zymurgical
endeavours
owing
to
brands
like
kalamazoo
as
well
as
expedition
double
cream
cherry
and
java
bells
became
an
elder
statesman
for
american
craftbrewed
stouts
even
before
it
could
legitimately
be
considered
an
elder
like
so
many
others
this
beer
was
one
of
my
first
forays
into
stouts
not
named
guinness
or
murphys
and
i
still
enjoy
it
now
as
much
as
i
did
then
overall
an
excellent
stout
and
thats
coming
from
an
ipa
lover
who
only
recently
developed
a
taste
for
stouts
not
a
huge
fan
of
black
licorice
so
the
aroma
wasnt
my
favorite
but
the
roasted
coffee
flavors
more
than
make
up
for
it
another
hit
for
bells
i
cant
believe
i
hadnt
rated
this
beer
nice
and
dark
for
a
good
stout
in
fact
i
like
putting
this
stout
in
my
chili
along
with
the
bells
porter
for
flavoring
purposes
small
to
medium
head
smooth
tasting
all
the
way
down
and
really
cant
ask
much
more
from
this
stout
bells
always
has
fine
products
this
one
is
no
exception
overall
a
smooth
easy
drinking
stout
im
surprised
it
held
up
as
well
as
it
did
definitely
better
fresh
though
o
a
great
nonimperial
stout
nearly
perfect
i
will
likely
drink
several
of
these
this
winter
its
very
dark
and
syrupy
to
look
at
unimpressive
head
which
doesnt
last
but
who
cares
this
stout
is
a
feast
for
the
other
senses
and
i
really
really
like
it
bottom
line
recommended
overall
one
real
nice
stout
dead
on
to
the
american
stout
style
one
you
can
enjoy
throughout
the
night
o
really
smootheasy
drinking
stout
probably
best
consumed
relatively
fresh
if
you
want
more
flavor
really
smooth
drinker
but
a
bit
mild
poured
from
a
bottle
into
an
english
pub
style
glass
massive
chocolate
brown
head
that
lingers
and
leave
great
lacing
on
the
glass
the
licorice
notes
are
very
evident
along
with
some
more
subtle
chocolate
notes
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
no
overpowering
coffee
or
chocolate
here
just
a
mild
roasty
flavor
with
little
hoppy
bitterness
has
a
chewy
mouth
feel
with
minimal
aftertaste
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
at
less
than
10
for
a
6
pack
this
could
one
of
my
seasonal
favorites
a
good
not
great
everyday
stout
merry
christmas
o
to
me
the
smell
is
better
than
the
taste
had
a
bit
to
much
bitterness
for
me
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
the
bite
tho
the
fizziness
was
a
little
more
than
i
cared
for
but
passable
would
have
another
but
wont
be
stocking
it
o
try
it
its
great
thanks
bells
overall
this
beer
is
tasty
and
goes
down
smooth
if
you
like
stouts
this
one
is
well
made
and
has
some
unique
subtleties
that
might
make
it
your
favorite
stout
o
a
definite
tasty
treat
always
a
fan
of
the
chocolatey
shouts
so
this
speaks
to
me
well
worth
a
try
i
poured
this
one
from
a
bottle
and
the
tan
head
and
the
black
beer
seemed
right
on
for
the
style
the
aroma
was
subdued
but
that
is
what
i
expect
from
a
stout
there
was
a
little
bit
of
roast
however
the
flavor
was
little
sweeter
and
a
little
less
dry
than
id
expect
from
a
nonimperial
stout
at
6
abv
it
is
a
little
stronger
than
some
traditional
stouts
but
i
still
felt
like
a
drier
and
more
roasted
profile
would
be
better
i
saw
that
they
added
licorice
to
it
so
maybe
this
has
something
to
do
with
it
id
definitely
have
this
one
again
but
there
are
others
that
i
like
more
i
really
enjoyed
this
why
does
their
porter
lack
the
same
dynamic
flavorful
and
creamy
qualities
this
has
this
could
pare
well
with
a
lot
of
food
and
desserts
and
works
well
on
its
own
i
hope
to
seek
out
more
beers
from
bells
that
are
more
on
this
level
for
sure
poured
into
nonic
pint
glass
jet
black
showing
slight
tinges
of
gentle
brown
in
the
sun
on
the
edges
very
minimal
fizzy
tan
head
which
fades
to
nothing
rapidly
not
sure
how
much
it
would
have
given
even
if
shed
poured
it
more
vigorously
smell
is
dark
roasted
malt
gentle
licorice
toffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
dark
bitter
roasted
malt
coffee
and
a
very
slight
probably
psychosomatic
hint
of
licorice
hint
of
some
hops
at
the
end
not
much
of
the
sweetness
suggested
by
the
smell
very
roasty
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
fizzy
for
the
lack
of
head
overall
mediumthin
almost
porterlike
if
it
werent
for
the
strong
flavors
other
than
the
slightly
unpleasant
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
licorice
seems
to
take
a
backseat
to
the
more
roasty
traditional
notes
of
a
good
stout
so
i
would
be
curious
to
see
how
it
changed
with
age
the
body
is
pretty
full
with
a
nice
thickness
and
pleasantly
creamy
off
a
bite
of
crispness
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
that
is
a
good
example
of
this
style
im
not
a
big
fan
of
licorice
and
was
glad
that
that
this
was
minimally
present
in
the
taste
as
expected
this
beer
benefits
from
letting
it
warm
up
overy
tasty
stout
not
my
favorite
but
overall
a
decent
go
to
stout
o
their
porter
and
stout
arent
making
me
too
excited
for
their
much
lauded
expedition
stout
too
dry
and
without
prominent
flavors
for
me
o
a
very
good
solid
stout
nice
smokey
and
roasted
coffee
flavors
with
it
being
a
lighter
feeling
stout
a
person
could
easily
have
multiples
overall
a
really
great
beer
the
faint
licorice
flavors
really
compliment
the
roastiness
of
the
malts
its
a
fantastic
combination
especially
when
you
consider
other
adjuncts
thrown
into
stouts
e
g
coffee
chocolate
i
would
love
to
taste
a
more
heavy
licorice
flavor
i
like
black
licorice
so
the
subtlety
of
the
flavor
makes
an
impact
but
i
would
love
to
see
it
be
a
little
more
assertive
i
really
appreciate
that
bells
has
such
variety
and
strong
tastes
but
that
necessarily
means
that
youre
not
going
to
like
some
of
it
overall
one
of
the
best
american
stouts
out
there
period
this
is
definitely
under
rated
if
given
the
time
and
opportunity
i
can
drink
these
all
day
kalamazoo
stout
can
hold
up
well
to
an
oily
cigar
o
for
me
kalamazoo
stout
is
a
year
round
stout
the
craft
brew
lover
can
enjoy
any
time
and
enjoy
multiple
without
the
sloppiness
it
packs
all
the
flavors
a
good
stout
should
all
while
remaining
an
easy
offering
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
enjoys
stouts
as
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
stouts
anyone
in
the
world
has
to
offer
overall
i
prefer
more
heft
and
body
in
a
stout
and
i
shouldnt
work
too
hard
to
find
the
flavors
the
taste
is
there
but
just
dial
down
the
bubbles
and
we
could
have
something
truly
good
o
drink
one
the
beer
for
me
is
too
toned
down
i
prefer
deschuttes
obsidian
stout
with
its
bigger
roasted
malt
character
and
deeper
flavors
in
the
end
its
a
well
made
beer
and
quite
delicious
however
just
a
good
stout
a
great
stout
comparable
to
a
deschutes
obsidian
or
sn
stout
overall
impression
a
very
complex
stout
for
its
relatively
low
abv
with
heavy
emphasis
on
the
roastedcharred
flavors
i
only
wish
it
was
balanced
with
a
bit
more
lighter
malt
character
and
sweetness
the
body
seemed
a
bit
thin
although
the
high
carbonation
is
partially
to
blame
love
the
beer
love
the
name
pour
black
in
a
glass
looks
a
little
watery
but
thats
ok
its
the
taste
that
will
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
frist
taste
of
bitterness
works
for
me
i
coulddrink
this
all
night
i
taste
chcolate
and
other
goodness
enjoy
this
and
their
bell
porter
are
wonderful
overall
one
could
almost
call
this
a
session
stout
at
6
abv
i
now
understand
why
this
american
stout
is
so
talked
about
will
definitely
visit
again
pours
a
dark
browntoblack
color
with
over
a
finger
of
tan
head
there
is
mild
roast
in
the
nose
roasted
maltiness
and
bitterness
are
upfront
but
the
bitter
finish
is
the
most
noticeable
quality
of
this
offering
quite
flavorful
for
a
single
stout
went
to
school
in
kalamazoo
great
beer
town
very
light
carbonation
and
thick
mouthfeel
smooth
for
as
dark
as
it
is
it
is
a
lighter
stout
overall
a
solid
near
exceptional
american
stout
more
sweet
than
roasty
with
great
smoothness
and
a
remarkably
drinkable
body
has
the
flavor
of
an
imperial
stout
without
the
punch
as
much
as
im
enjoying
it
its
strangely
one
of
those
remarkable
beers
that
i
wouldnt
miss
if
i
never
had
it
again
mostly
due
to
cost
availability
and
the
quality
of
other
stouts
more
readily
available
to
me
taste
is
is
ok
but
with
the
lack
of
alcohol
the
beer
missen
that
something
kalamazoo
stout
is
a
solid
bells
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
stouts
but
this
ones
fine
and
good
its
not
super
big
roasty
and
thick
like
some
other
stouts
out
there
or
imperial
stouts
of
course
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
not
extremely
memorable
but
still
a
good
one
definitely
overrated
though
in
my
opinion
oso
far
my
favorite
bells
brew
its
the
only
one
that
exceeded
my
expectations
subtle
but
the
flavors
all
make
a
good
presence
the
body
is
thick
and
chewy
but
it
finishes
crisp
very
satisfying
brew
overall
a
good
light
beer
aroma
taste
had
a
big
chocolate
and
toffee
aroma
the
beer
was
heavy
and
full
bodied
with
a
long
finish
the
chocolate
and
toffee
mashed
well
over
slight
molasses
and
spice
undertones
the
long
finish
added
to
the
enjoyment
aromas
of
coffee
and
chocolate
enticed
as
a
thick
foamy
head
formed
on
the
thick
dark
black
beer
the
taste
is
very
roasted
malty
and
sweet
with
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
aftertaste
is
pleasantly
sweet
this
stout
was
so
sweet
to
me
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
as
a
digestifdessert
type
beer
but
the
roasty
stoutness
complements
the
sweetness
well
overall
i
am
very
glad
that
i
finally
tried
this
stout
admittedly
i
initially
predicting
this
beer
to
suffer
from
common
stout
complaints
watery
thinbodied
etc
however
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
stouts
at
this
price
point
and
given
its
easydrinking
and
enjoyable
qualities
kalamazoo
stout
should
never
be
overlooked
o
teriffic
the
nice
smoky
wood
flavor
is
wonderful
up
front
and
the
licorice
adds
a
nice
touch
this
almost
reminds
me
of
dogfish
heads
chicory
stout
only
better
and
more
regularly
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
definitely
be
buying
again
alot
of
complex
flavor
without
the
the
big
alcohol
volume
this
beer
fills
the
void
in
the
quest
for
big
stout
like
flavor
that
it
might
be
a
while
before
i
pick
up
an
imperial
stout
again
i
might
have
to
try
founders
side
by
side
bells
nailed
it
overall
a
good
beer
made
even
better
on
cask
highly
recommended
if
you
can
have
it
served
this
way
ill
have
this
again
for
further
thoughts
pours
about
a
finger
width
of
head
mocha
to
tan
in
color
smells
of
coffee
chocolate
and
licorice
tastes
of
espresso
chicory
and
licorice
with
just
a
bit
of
smoky
peat
mouthfeel
is
not
very
fizzy
due
to
low
carbonation
but
rather
thick
and
rich
overall
a
nice
smoky
stout
cant
go
wrong
with
bells
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
im
not
sure
the
cellar
did
much
if
anything
for
this
brew
that
being
said
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
it
either
the
beer
is
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
half
inch
of
beige
head
the
aroma
offers
molasses
dark
roast
black
coffee
malty
with
dark
roasted
coffee
rich
and
slightly
sweet
finishing
bitter
molasses
with
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
medium
bodied
with
moderately
low
carbonation
another
solid
offering
from
bells
overall
a
great
tasting
stout
not
as
big
a
licorice
flavor
as
advertised
but
the
other
flavors
were
blended
nicely
o
great
stout
good
mix
of
flavors
very
enjoyable
another
great
product
from
bells
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
good
stout
really
great
balance
of
flavors
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
tasty
stout
with
a
great
drinkability
and
wonderful
feelflavor
a
great
roasty
but
rather
balanced
stout
overall
thank
god
the
burnt
smells
i
got
werent
in
the
taste
this
would
make
a
wonderful
session
beer
for
stout
lovers
not
the
best
stout
out
there
but
one
that
is
above
average
for
sure
price
is
right
for
the
flavor
you
get
this
would
be
one
i
get
again
4
o
outstanding
single
american
stout
this
beer
is
very
robust
and
complex
for
a
single
6
abv
stout
it
has
more
depth
and
flavor
than
many
imperial
stouts
i
have
had
the
licorice
is
well
balanced
as
is
this
beer
in
general
slam
dunk
for
bells
the
taste
impressed
me
enough
to
want
to
try
another
one
poured
a
little
more
aggressively
overall
this
is
a
unique
stout
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
the
color
is
black
with
a
light

the
head
didnt
last
long
but
left
a
foamy
ring
the
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
coffee
bitter
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
caramel
the
taste
is
of

and
licorice
the

this
is
a
must

will
definitely
be
seeking
this

the
taste
overall
a
nice
change
up
if
you
are
looking
for
a
bit
more
hops
in
your
stout
this
one
may
be
right
up
your

medium

less

than
i
expected
based
on
the
appearance
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
could
be
slightly
creamier
overall
a
great
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
this
is
the
first
bells
that
ive
had
looking
forward
to
trying
more
this
a
great
quality
tasting
stout
especially
given
the
good
price
i
picked
a
bottle
up
for
on
a
whim
often
it
seems
stouts
can
be
a
little
heavy
on
coffee
or
chocolatey
tastes
but
there
was
none
of
that
noticeable
to
me
in
this
beer
which
works
to
its
benefit
because
of
its
fairly
low
profile
but
all
around
crisp
and
relatively
mild
flavor
its
definitely
something
i
could
drink
with
some
regularity
i
will
certainly
be
purchasing
it
again
in
greater
quantity
in
the
future
oa
very
good
stout
and
a
shame
i
cannot
get
this
and
other
bells
beer
in
california
ill
continue
to
buy
this
when
i
can
overall
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
especially
for
the
price
i
think
it
was
on
sale
at
meijers
for
8
50
i
would
say
its
way
better
then
the
majority
of
easy
to
get
bells
beer
excluding
hopslam
two
hearted
and
expedition
o
a
very
good
stout
a
great
combination
of
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
along
with
notes
of
vanilla
chocolate
coffee
several
beers
from
this
brewery
do
not
disappoint
i
cant
wait
to
sample
some
of
the
other
stouts
in
the
lineup
not
bad
a
little
on
the
bland
side
an
average
stout
worth
a
try
but
nothing
all
that
special
i
would
say
this
was
a
slightly
above
average
stout
it
could
have
been
more
flavorful
but
overall
not
bad
overall
this
is
a
solid
stout
that
is
packed
with
a
huge
aroma
and
a
huge
flavor
especially
for
being
only
6
abv
the
body
could
stand
to
be
a
bit
thicker
and
creamier
but
this
is
still
something
that
is
very
drinkable
and
very
flavorful
all
the
way
up
and
down
commendable
brew
i
have
an
expedition
waiting
in
the
fridge
expectations
from
which
have
increased
o
its
what
i
was
expecting
i
have
been
impressed
with
bells
a
trend
that
is
likely
to
continue
it
wasnt
too
pricey
either
and
it
was
worth
every
penny
and
more
a
must
have
o
easy
drinking
solid
stout
but
something
about
the
licorice
and
smoke
turn
me
off
bottle
poured
into
snifter
this
one
has
been
chilling
in
the
cellar
for
a
while
10
months
and
moved
to
the
fridge
a
few
weeks
ago
pour
was
a
fairly
uneventful
motor
oil
with
a
tiny
mocca
head
a
minimal
lacing
and
retention
smell
is
of
dark
malts
burnt
chocolate
coffee
and
some
carmel
a
decent
smelling
stout
taste
follows
the
nose
but
i
pick
up
more
of
the
coffee
and
a
slight
metallic
finish
some
chocolate
and
licorice
come
on
at
the
end
its
a
pretty
bold
tasting
stout
and
a
bit
too
much
on
the
burnt
end
for
me
has
a
smoky
quality
as
well
feel
is
nice
and
creamy
not
a
ton
of
carbonation
and
i
do
like
the
silk
quality
on
the
end
overall
its
a
pretty
good
stout
that
was
enjoyable
the
metallic
finish
was
a
bit
disappointing
and
i
wanted
more
of
the
chocolate
and
less
of
the
burnt
coffee
better
than
average
but
not
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
would
like
to
try
another
that
is
more
fresh
will
give
this
another
shot
its
worth
the
try
this
a
very
good
stout
the
taste
is
spot
on
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
non
imperial
stouts
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
id
still
serve
it
chilled
pours

thick

coffee
flavor
with
the
presence
of
carbonation
and
alcohol
finishes
bittersweet
with
a
long
lingering
char
flavor
that
keeps
on
coming
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
it
had
a
bit
more
of
a
smoky
taste
than
i
was
expecting
o
this
beer
looks
totally
phenomenal
in
the
glass
i
was
disappointed
in
the
aroma
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
made
up
for
that
outstanding
stout
o
a
tasty
stout
which
has
a
pleasant
undertone
of
liquorice
and
a
solid
cocoa
malt
flavour
glad
i
scored
a
bottle
as
it
easily
exceeded
my
expectations
o
a
highly
drinkable
stout
benefiting
from
a
wealth
of
flavor
without
being
heavy
a
great
brew
for
only
11sixer
o
great
beer
over
all
another
one
of
the
many
great
beers
brewed
and
enjoyed
in
my
college
town
this
makes
a
great
session
beer
for
parties
and
tasting
it
brings
back
some
wonderful
memories
it
has
a
lot
of
shocking
parts
with
the
mediumlight
body
anise
incredibly
dark
head
and
it
all
works
out
wonderfully
o
overall
kind
of
disappointed
by
this
beer
was
expecting
more
chocolate
coffee
something
anything
m
thicker
than
i
thoughtpretty
fullbodied
velvetsmooth
with
little
noticeable
carbonation
overall
great
looking
and
smelling
beer
i
only
wish
it
was
some
what
sweeter
to
balance
with
the
roasted
coffee
and
hops
flavor
an
awesome
stout
by
a
great
brewery
hard
to
believe
the
java
stout
was
a
bit
more
subtle
than
this
on
the
roasted
flavors
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
everyday
stout
lower
abv
good
balance
and
something
i
would
go
for
again
if
i
wanted
a
low
abv
stout
i
will
get
the
higher
abv
imperial
stouts
next
time
though
if
i
am
looking
for
the
stout
flavor
i
love
overall
this
is
a
very
good
stout
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
given
the
opportunity
poured
dark
with
a
relatively
thick
nitro
like
head
giving
off
little
nose
smells
of
wood
chocolate
and
toasted
malts
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
malt
smoke
oak
coffee
smooth
mouthfeel
with
medium
carb
overall
a
decent
stout
but
if
it
wasnt
local
i
wouldnt
trade
for
it
kalamazoo
stout
pours
up
a
nice
black
with
a
minimal
tan
head
and
lots
of
residual
delicate
lacing
left
on
the
glass
smell
is
licorice
roasted
nuts
coffee
bread
soy
sauce
and
floral
mouthfeel
is
very
full
erring
on
the
side
of
less
carbonation
taste
is
fantastic
hops
at
the
beginning
sweet
in
the
middle
and
hops
in
the
end
with
a
not
so
disagreeable
coffee
aftertaste
a
magnificent
offering
from
bells
o
great
stout
the
finish
takes
a
little
bit
away
from
it
overall
but
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
this
was
a
very
disappointing
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
or
something
but
mine
poured
nearly
completely
flat
with
absolutely
no
head
i
looked
at
it
and
there
was
literally
about
3
bubbles
floating
around
on
top
one
of
my
favorite
parts
of
stouts
is
the
nice
thick
head
i
got
it
at
a
bar
and
needless
to
say
i
was
very
upset
that
i
had
just
wasted
6
on
such
a
terrible
beer
luckily
i
had
some
amazing
beers
as
well
that
night
that
made
up
for
it
o
a
very
nice
stout
balanced
and
tasty
o
i
really
liked
this
i
do
tend
to
lean
towards
darker
beers
in
general
but
this
was
great
nonetheless
very
complex
brew
and
i
will
most
likely
seek
this
out
again
the
kalamazoo
stout
is
a
straight
ahead
traditional
stout
that
reminds
of
how
good
a
beer
can
be
when
the
fundamentals
are
well
honed
kalamazoo
stout
pours
solid
black
with
about
two
fingers
of
dark
tan
foam
rising
up
and
filling
whatever
empty
space
there
was
in
the
glass
head
retention
is
very
good
and
theres
a
decent
amount
left
sticking
around
the
glass
the
nose
has
plenty
of
coffee
but
its
on
the
sweet
side
rather
than
dry
black
coffee
that
sweetness
comes
together
on
my
palate
as
a
healthy
dose
of
caramel
right
up
front
roasted
grains
come
in
next
with
coffee
featuring
much
more
prominently
than
chocolate
theres
a
very
subtle
flourish
of
licorice
in
the
finish
which
adds
to
the
beer
nicely
the
body
has
some
sturdiness
but
ideally
id
like
it
to
be
just
a
little
bit
more
full
the
carbonation
does
an
admirable
job
of
largely
staying
out
of
the
way
and
letting
the
malt
shine
im
usually
a
fan
of
bells
beers
but
the
other
stout
ive
had
from
them
expedition
stout
wasnt
my
favorite
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
when
i
opened
kalamazoo
stout
its
an
admirable
american
stout
though
and
one
id
welcome
in
my
glass
again
this
one
serves

o
good
stout
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
would
be
a
good
stout
for
winter
but
is
still
drinkable
enough
to
enjoy
in
the
hot
summer
too
o
its
always
a
treat
to
get
the
chance
to
try
a
bells
beer
here
in
california
ive
had
several
varieties
and
havent
been
let
down
yet
save
for
cherry
stout
they
sure
know
what
they
are
doing
in
mi
i
can
see
myself
buying
this
on
a
regular
basis
the
only
other
year
round
unimperial
stout
that
holds
a
candle
is
deschuttes
obsidian
id
be
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
was
available
in
my
part
of
the
world
went
down
easy
even
on
a
hot
summer
evening
m
lighter
side
of
medium
slick
feeling
final
thoughts
i
really
liked
this
beer
its
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
from
a
bottle
almost
treading
the
line
between
being
a
porter
and
a
stout
ill
definitely
being
seeking
this
one
out
again
especially
in
the
colder
months
this
beer
is
pitch
black
and
has
a
brownish
head
with
decent
retention
this
beer
has
a
relatively
low
bitterness
there
is
a
smooth
and
very
creamy
feel
to
the
beer
and
it
has
an
overall
great
feel
to
it
this
beer
is
very
roasty
but
also
has
some
chocolate
flavor
in
it
to
keep
it
from
being
too
bland
i
quite
enjoyed
this
stout
and
hold
it
a
notch
higher
then
their
double
cream
stout
a
nicely
dry
mild
stout
that
doesnt
overpower
but
stands
its
ground
would
definitely
recommend
o
this
is
a
good
stout
all
of
the
usual
suspects
are
here
as
far
as
look
smell
and
taste
with
the
addition
of
a
little
bit
of
licorice
at
the
finish
the
body
is
a
little
bit
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
but
the
zip
from
the
licorice
adds
a
uniqueness
that
keeps
the
mouthfeel
at
a
4
i
kind
of
expected
a
little
bit
more
probably
unfairly
just
because
its
bells
but
this
is
definitely
a
good
and
drinkable
beer
a
drinkable
stout
but
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
d
very
drinkable
excellent
example
of
an
american
stout
balance
is
spot
on
no
glass
so
unable
to
comment
on
color
or
head
scent
of
coffee
and
milk
chocolate
excellent
taste
likely
my
favorite
of
bells
stouts
thus
far
particularly
pleasing
aftertaste
tasted
slightly
nutty
strong
coffee
taste
hint
of
licorice
lingering
coffee
aftertaste
less
herby
than
expedition
a
robust
and
well
balanced
stout
d
if
it
werent
for
the
wonderful
succession
of
flavors
that
i
got
in
the
ten
seconds
following
each
sip
i
would
call
this
beer
mediocre
as
it
is
i
call
it
good
but
by
no
means
great
hayward
abbey
rating
87
pours
a
wonderfully
deep
black
with
some
very
nice
tan

and
very
good

throughout
nice
deep
roasted

scents
with
a
nice
bit
of
earthiness
underneath
wonderfully
deep
roasted

flavors
with
great
chocolate
taste
and
a
hint
of
coffee
along
with
a
nice
semicitrus
and
semiearthy
hoppiness
at
the
end
very
rich
creamy
smooth
and
thick
overall
its
surely
a
favorite
and
worth
putting
in
the
six
pack
rotation
of
stouts
o
a
solid
american
stout
unique
intensely
flavored
yet
with
a
very
manageable
abv
a
great
stout
with
a
pleasant
black
licorice
twist
without
the
added
sweetness
of
molasses
overall
good
but
a
little
lighter
bodied
than
i
like
between
this
and
the
double
cream
i
had
recently
i
think
bells
make
a
pretty
damn
good
stout
overall
a
slightly
better
than
average
stout
too
bad
i
dont
see
it
around
here
often
osimilar
to
their
porter
a
solid
stout
nothing
makes
it
stand
out
among
the
crowd
though
very
fine
beer
i
want
to
drink
this
before
sex
in
the
snow
but
after
a
fine
conaque
larry
well
done
again
o
pretty
good
stuff
licorice
didnt
really
translate
into
the
taste
but
whatever
im
fine
with
that
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
very
quaffable
it
sits
very
lightly
in
the
stomach
a
nice
sessionable
beer
o
pretty
nice
stout
the
licorice
is
a
little
too
dominant
and
some
other
strong
flavors
to
balance
it
would
be
nice
otherwise
quite
good
finger
and
a
half
billowing
medium
brown
head
fairly
slow
dissipating
with
clinging
solid
lacing
over
dark
brown
oapque
body
really
dark
nose
features
complex
amalgam
of
roast
some
citrus
mild
licorice
faint
cocoa
nib
a
bit
of
grassiness
the
aroma
changed
significantly
once
the
beer
warmed
chocolate
notes
became
more
assertive
taste
is
more
sweet
than
bitter
fruity
up
front
some
roast
not
a
lot
of
coffee
compared
to
java
stout
in
the
middle
licorice
towards
the
backend
mild
resin
bitterness
in
the
back
as
the
beer
warmed
the
chocolate
became
more
prevalent
mouthfeel
pretty
close
to
medium
not
heavy
good
effervescence
a
pretty
filling
beer
for
the
abv
on
the
heavy
side
a
bit
pretty
complex
for
style
o
hard
to
believe
that
the
same
brewer
that
makes
expedition
makes
this
watered
down
flat
stout
i
guess
i
can
tick
this
off
the
list
and
never
be
wanting
one
again
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
stout
with
lovely
notes
of
licorice
in
it
there
is
an
enjoyable
flavor
aroma
and
mouthfeel
not
exactly
a
sessionable
beer
but
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
you
could
probably
enjoy
a
couple
in
an
evening
overall
this
is
a
great
stout
i
normally
dislike
black
licorice
notes
in
dark
beers
but
this
is
enjoyable
good
stout
made
by
bells
overall
for
a
stout
it
has
alot
going
for
it
its
got
rich
flavors
a
great
smell
and
a
balanced
mouthfeel
this
is
hands
down
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
and
its
absolutely
worth
checking
out
this
is
a
very
good
stout
it
has
very
clean
flavor
and
the
aftertaste
is
really
good
i
wish
i
could
get
this
in
new
jersey
i
would
like
to
age
a
few
bottles
to
try
over
time
maybe
i
could
find
this
in
pennsylvania
first
off
i
must
say
those
guys
over
there
at
bells
continue
to
put
out
a
quality
product
this
beer
is
very
good
upon
pouring
you
will
notice
the
rich
dark
chocolate
color
and
how
smoothly
it
pours
with
the
right
amount
of
head
and
lace
the
aroma
is
of
creamy
malts
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
extraordinary
very
few
beers
go
down
this
smooth
this
is
a
great
stout
leaves
no
aftertaste
just
smooth
refreshing
stout
at
its
finest
o
easy
drinker
and
an
excellent
stout
well
worth
a
try
o
the
licorice
never
really
crossed
my
palate
or
was
identified
i
thought
the
smell
was
unmatched
for
a
simple
american
stout
but
lacked
depth
in
taste
still
very
much
enjoyed
i
blame
some
of
the
quality
on
the
store
which
i
purchased
this
single
beer
from
world
market
where
this
beer
was
stored
warm
for
multiple
months
i
can
easily
get
a
six
pack
fresh
which
i
will
do
and
rereview
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
solid
stout
another
good
offering
from
bells
i
have
been
disappointed
with
my
last
few
reviews
so
it
is
nice
to
review
an
impressive
beer
which
exceeded
my
expectations
i
would
highly
recommend
this
brew
sessionable
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
them
man
this
was
good
i
will
get
more
overall
a
very
nice
stout
bells
seems
to
do
no
wrong
and
i
only
wish
that
i
could
buy
their
beers
in
ontario
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
modest
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
accentuated
by
the
body
and
carbonation
quite
pleasant
to
sip
the
palate
opens
with
a
wonderful
blend
of
licorice
dark
chocolate
and
an
aggressive
yet
restrained
roast
fruity
midpalate
with
some
dried
figs
along
with
an
excellent
creaminess
dries
up
on
the
finish
with
a
rather
exceptional
balance
of
roast
licorice
dark
chocolate
and
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
them
all
out
this
is
really
nice
mediumlight
in
body
with
moderate
but
creamy
carbonation
this
feels
really
really
good
on
the
palate
among
the
best
stouts
there
is
highly
recommended
o
very
drinkable
but
also
pretty
standard
for
the
style
its
not
outstanding
in
any
way
but
taken
on
its
own
merits
it
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
and
easily
a
session
ale
overall
not
the
best
stout
in
bells
lineup
coming
in
at
only
6
its
a
welcomed
change
from
all
the
heavy
hitters
ive
had
lately
o
definitely
a
great
stout
its
not
perfect
but
it
genuinely
makes
me
wish
i
didnt
have
to
drive
to
virginia
to
get
it
then
again
its
worth
going
a
state
over
to
pick
it
up
this
is
an
enjoyable
stout
but
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
see
it
offered
somewhere
where
youre
shopping
or
if
you
are
a
big
fan
of
licorice
as
an
additive
pours
black
with
small
off
white
head
nose
is
heavy
on
chocolate
with
some
beautiful
roasty
earthy
spicy
coffee
in
the
background
taste
is
full
bodied
with
the
big
coffee
and
mocha
standing
out
prominently
earthy
light
coffee
spice
roast
wow
not
too
sweet
or
syrupy
medium
carbonation
what
an
excellent
stout
this
is
probably
the
best
nonimperial
nonsweetmilk
stout
out
there
and
you
can
drink
it
all
day
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
finishes
dry
overall
this
is
a
great
stout
even
if
i
would
only
have
one
per
sitting
othis
is
pretty
good
nothing
special
but
great
stout
for
a
pretty
good
price
could
benefit
from
a
bit
more
of
a
chocolate
flavor
but
very
good
still
o
overall
quite
good
again
somewhat
different
than
the
usual
stout
but
still
quite
good
in
its
own
respects
o
a
very
tasty
brew
with
a
nice
balance
the
coffee
is
very
well
presented
the
taste
is
robust
a
balanced
bit
of
hop
bitterness
is
definitely
there
while
the
dark
malt
leaves
an
amazing
roasty
bourbonesque
flavor
in
your
mouth
long
after
you
swallow
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
only
ever
so
slightly
carbonated
i
dont
know
how
they
pulled
this
off
while
keeping
it
at
6
abv
im
impressed
a
good
sipper
this
beer
pours
a
really
dark
black
with
a
medium
tan
head
smell
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
great
beer
and
on
a
winter
day
also
a
very
good
beer
to
pair
with
dessert
highly
enjoyable
o
not
really
my
type
of
stout
it
was
overwhelmingly
dry
and
bitter
and
just
lacked
much
flavor
with
the
licorice
barely
being
noticeable
one
last
note
the
brewers
licorice
comment
on
the
label
made
me
shy
away
from
this
at
first
do
not
let
this
deter
you
if
you
dont
like
licorice
this
is
not
a
licorice
beer
the
licorice
is
simply
a
component
of
a
complex
symphony
one
that
is
worthy
of
tasting
o
the
flavors
and
smell
are
right
on
although
a
tad
more
liqorice
would
be
nice
but
to
me
a
more
substantial
mouthfeel
would
make
this
a
much
more
enjoyable
beer
maybe
more
carbonation
or
simply
a
bit
thickeroilywhatever
easy
drinking
smooth
taste
i
remember
my
first
time
drinking
it
after
a
night
out
that
it
tasted
like
pure
chocolate
of
course
in
more
of
a
sober
state
it
doesnt
taste
exactly
like
chocolate

o
overall
id
say
that
the
appearance
and
some
of
the
uniqueness
in
flavor
of
the
beers
taste
balance
out
the
shortcomings
of
body
and
traditional
stout
flavor
its
a
beer
that
makes
you
want
to
take
a
second
sip
after
the
first
because
you
cant
really
figure
out
what
flavors
your
tastebuds
are
pointing
you
towards
i
didnt
get
a
lot
of
coffee
caramel
chocolate
etc
from
the
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
actually
quite
thin
its
a
tossup
the
body
isnt
overly
robust
albeit
extremely
easy
to
drink
the
carbonation
is
gentle
and
the
fluffy
mouthfeel
has
a
slippery
character
to
it
it
finishes
pretty
dry
aiding
to
its
effortless
quaffability
i
wasnt
particularly
looking
forward
to
this
beer
because
i
feared
a
licorice
bomb
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
this
is
just
one
small
aspect
of
a
very
big
flavor
i
approve
a
black
body
with
about
an
inch
of
foamy
frothy
light
khaki
head
nice
gobs
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
caramel
hints
of
vanilla
and
cane
sugar
it
tastes
rather
sweet
up
front
with
sugar
chocolate
vanilla
and
some
faint
hops
finishes
with
roasted
malt
and
coffee
grounds
mouthfeel
is
rich
thick
and
finishes
a
bit
syrupy
overall
a
good
american
stout
o
superb
stuff
from
bells
definitely
need
to
get
more
of
this
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
with
a
light
body
an
almost
watery
overall
feel
and
a
tasty
bitterness
that
makes
this
a
sessionable
stout
for
me
very
smooth
full
of
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
light
stout
that
i
could
drink
all
night
or
pair
with
food
the
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
to
high
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
body
in
the
range
of
moderate
to
full
finishes
dry
with
an
aftertaste
of
dark
bitter
roasted
coffee
overall
a
solid
stout
on
a
side
note
bells
says
this
has
licorice
in
it
but
i
couldnt
detect
any
pours
black
and
opaque
impenetrable
to
light
cocoa
brown
coloured
head
of
a
finger
or
two
with
light
retention
and
some
pretty
good
lace
nose
has
some
cocoa
licorice
and
a
general
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
roast
taste
has
bakers
chocolate
a
bit
of
sugary
dark
fruits
licorice
is
more
subtle
and
big
kick
of
roastiness
at
the
end
good
sweetness
complements
the
roasty
bitterness
and
balances
it
nicely
pretty
fullbodied
with
a
fairly
low
carbonation
an
excellent
stout
i
wish
i
could
stock
this
regularly
o
not
really
a
fan
and
i
wouldnt
purchase
again
it
doesnt
taste
too
bad
just
average
pours
a
nice
deep
black
with
a
great

head
great
deep
aroma
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
slight
hint
of
licorice
fantastic
tasting
beer
really
deep
complex
flavor
that
has
just
enough
licorice
for
you
to
taste
but
not
to
overpower
the

itself
and
grab
my
attention
thanks
so
much
to
marc
for
sending
me
this
in
an
epic
michigan
beer
box
this
was
a
great
stout
with
big
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
it
had
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
is
perfect
as
a
session
stout
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
never
get
old
of
it
it
is
also
surprisingly
refreshing
great
brew
thanks
again
marc
d
and
o
a
great
american
stout
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
more
enjoyable
classic
stouts
ive
had
in
a
while
great
balance
lots
of
flavor
easy
drinking
very
straight
forward
nothing
unique
but
very
enjoyable
good
stuff
from
bells
i
was
lukewarm
on
this
beer
at
first
but
i
find
myself
liking
it
more
with
each
sip
its
flavorful
and
balanced
i
wouldnt
mind
it
if
they
cranked
up
the
licorice
though
pours
straight
black
with
one
finger
of
dark
brown
head
lots
of
nice
roasty
chocolatey
notes
on
the
nose
it
also
has
an
underlying
complexity
that
i
am
interpreting
as
the
licorice
that
the
label
says
is
in
there
just
a
touch
boozy
estery
on
the
nose
taste
is
more
of
the
same
really
full
bodied
roasted
stout
good
complexity
but
also
very
easy
drinking
overall
a
really
nice
brew
just
wish
they
distributed
to
my
area
overall
an
absolutely
fantastic
stout
big
fan
of
bells
and
most
of
their
brews
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
overall
a
good
beer
it
feels
a
little
lighter
bodied
out
of
the
bottle
than
what
i
remember
out
of
the
tap
but
still
robust
and
filling
good
way
to
start
my
day
an
excellent
stout
that
feels
more
flavorful
that
its
abv
might
lead
on
this
beer
is
extremely
well
executed
and
very
drinkable
after
having
their
sweet
and
luxurious
double
cream
stout
this
one
is
kind
of
like
that
but
with
a
hefty
dose
of
hops
to
halt
the
sweet
malts
in
their
place
it
is
really
a
toss
up
between
them
and
you
cant
go
wrong
with
either
bottom
line
id
drink
it
again
gladly
pours
an
inky
black
with
a
brown
head
which
clings
nicely
to
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
crisp
and
medicinal
i
believe
this
is
due
to
the
licorice
mentioned
on
the
bottle
the
taste
consists
mostly
of
roasted
barley
toasted
bread
and
a
hint
of
caramel
this
beer
coats
the
mouth
very
well
it
is
solidly
thick
not
as
dry
as
some
stouts
either
well
done
bells
great
start
to
thanksgiving
o
this
beer
is
great
not
the
best
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
deschutes
obsidian
is
more
the
american
stout
for
me
but
this
certainly
has
its
place
too
i
love
the
rich
roastiness
ive
been
having
so
many
imperial
stouts
lately
i
drink
it
expecting
it
to
be
10
so
its
nice
thats
its
not
and
a
little
more
laid
back
4
5
d
really
great
beer
this
one
surprised
me
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
this
stellar
overall
good
is
the
best
adjective
to
describe
this
beer
in
my
opinion
it
is
good
but
doesnt
really
have
any
qualities
that
really
set
me
off
or
make
me
really
think
hard
about
the
flavors
it
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
that
i
will
be
thinking
about
for
too
long
o
i
must
say
the
apprehensive
nature
of
this
beer
is
impressive
here
you
could
have
an
extreme
beer
with
a
9
abv
loads
of
carbonation
and
a
bunch
of
licorice
dumped
into
it
instead
its
a
humble
6
as
much
carbonation
as
is
needed
and
doesnt
have
an
overabundance
of
licorice
so
you
can
actually
drink
more
than
one
without
being
weighed
down
by
unnecessary
alcohol
and
intense
flavors
yet
again
i
say
bells
is
the
shiznit
o
a
very
nice
stout
i
love
that
it
is
only
six
percent
allowing
you
to
really
enjoy
the
beer
without
fear
of
it
messing
you
up
too
bad
this
is
a
good
stout
staple
embodies
what
i
think
of
as
a
regular
nonimperial
stout
if
i
wanted
to
introduce
someone
to
the
style
i
might
use
this
one
o
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
bells
there
cherry
stout
still
reigns
supreme
of
this
but
it
is
decent
this
is
a
solid
stout
its
fairly
simple
and
to
the
point
but
the
simplicity
works
here
ive
had
this
one
several
times
and
will
probably
have
it
again
overall
its
a
brew
like
this
that
makes
oatmeal
stouts
and
stouts
overall
among
my
favorite
styles
i
will
get
this
again
and
soon
this
was
certainly
a
surprise
as
i
tend
to
dislike
anything
brewed
with
aniselicorice
the
good
part
is
that
its
not
overpowering
by
any
means
and
really
works
as
an
addition
to
the
base
flavors
again
put
it
on
the
label
i
dont
think
so
unless
you
just
want
to
say
youre
doing
something
different
i
think
that
this
has
a
lot
going
for
a
nice
stout
very
drinkable
and
a
great
sessionable
brew
for
a
stout
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
slight
coffee
and
nice
roasted
malt
this
is
a
bit
slick
on
the
tongue
and
didnt
quite
have
the
body
that
i
would
have
liked
light
tan
head
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
that
seemed
to
be
a
nice
tickle
on
the
way
down
i
think
that
for
me
this
just
needed
a
bit
more
body
to
it
and
maybe
a
bit
more
alcohol
to
back
it
up
i
do
understand
that
this
is
not
an
ris
but
i
guess
im
spoiled
for
an
everyday
stout
this
is
great
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
with
the
great
rating
this
has
been
given
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
a
little
syrupy
but
not
overly
so
very
drinkable
and
good
i
get
this
once
in
awhile
and
i
always
enjoy
it
kalamazoo
stout
pours
with
a
deep
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
which
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
lacing
on
top
of
the
beer
aroma
is
very
good
lots
of
coco
roast
can
get
a
touch
of
earthyness
and
a
very
mild
caramel
note
the
flavor
is
nice
but
falls
a
bit
short
the
creamy
chocolatey
character
that
the
aroma
had
gives
way
to
more
of
a
patent
malt
burnt
roastyness
with
a
bit
of
an
earthy
chalky
coco
flavor
which
is
nice
but
not
as
great
as
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
not
much
creaminess
a
bit
sharp
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
for
a
stout
for
me
this
is
closer
to
a
dry
stout
than
a
regular
stout
but
it
is
damn
good
anyway
o
unique
a
good
tasty
stout
with
the
combination
of
sweetness
roast
and
dryness
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
though
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
stouts
i
have
had
in
this
abv
range
i
would
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
while
i
sat
at
a
pub
drink
i
like
the
use
of
the
licorice
in
this
bottle
the
format
works
well
as
i
dont
think
i
could
do
a
whole
bomber
or
750
of
this
stout
im
glad
i
tried
this
though
it
would
not
be
my
first
choice
for
a
stout
it
is
interesting
and
good
cheers
overall
i
would
try
this
stout
again
good
stuff
from
bells
overall
a
great
stout
for
somebody
who
doesnt
want
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
big
that
is
so
common
of
this
style
yet
keep
from
compromising
the
flavor
easily
understood
as
a
cult
classic
ty
bells
way
back
when
this
was
my
first
stout
that
wasnt
a
guinness
still
one
of
my
favorites
overall
really
the
first
beer
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
just
an
overall
great
beer
a
decent
wellflavoured
dessertadjacent
yankee
stout
the
extra
point
of
abv
wellobfuscated
the
licorice
not
overplayed
whats
not
to
like
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
roasty
and
a
small
sweet
licorice
presence
in
the
taste
a
small
roast
sweet
coffee
and
notes
of
licorice
a
small
bite
yet
mainly
smooth
and
a
medium
to
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
and
roasty
coffee
and
licorice
in
the
aftertaste
nice
sweet
to
dry
coffee
and
notes
of
licorice
o
just
okay
not
something
i
would
revisit
oa
its
okay
more
regular
stout
than
licorice
i
liked
the
stone
belgo
anise
irs
better
just
had
the
stronger
anise
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
12
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
this
one
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
uncooked
bread
dough
slight
chocolate
and
oddly
enough
a
bit
like
playdough
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
powder
and
some
mild
coffee
bean
flavors
i
am
not
getting
licorice
in
either
the
smell
or
taste
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
quickly
fades
from
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
crisp
level
of
carbonation
with
a
nice
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
but
nothing
that
great
in
the
long
run
i
enjoy
the
way
this
beer
smells
more
than
the
way
it
tastes
o
not
a
bad
take
on
a
stout
the
licorice
at
the
end
is
kinda
different
but
that
isnt
always
a
bad
thing
i
enjoyed
this
but
it
didnt
wow
me
overall
a
very
solid
stout
that
is
very
full
flavored
and
heavy
for
a
non
imperial
stout
an
impressive
everyday
stout
that
mixes
in
some
flavors
other
than
straight
coffee
really
liked
the
licorice
scent
o
really
solid
licorice
is
a
differentiator
flavors
could
be
a
little
more
bold
overall
an
excellent
stout
in
all
regards
very
hard
to
beat
kalamazoo
stout
is
an
amazing
american
stout
great
stout
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
in
bottles
pours
opaque
black
with
a
cream
beige
head
aroma
of
roasted
malts
milk
chocolate
and
licorice
taste
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
coffee
notes
sweet
chocolate
caramel
and
light
sensations
of
dark
fruits
and
licorice
fullbodied
smooth
and
rich
and
nicely
drinkable
overall
too
bitter
not
necessarily
in
a
hoppy
way
but
more
of
a
burnt
manner
mouthfeel
is
too
oily
not
overwhelmingly
impressed
a
delicious
stout
thanks
again
o
reminds
me
a
lot
of
edmund
fitzgerald
but
with
the
chocolate
notes
being
at
the
forefront
of
this
one
rather
than
the
roasted
coffee
being
at
the
forefront
of
the
edmund
fitzgerald
good
balance
of
sweet
roasty
and
bitter
though
and
very
drinkable
this
has
always
been
a
beer
i
have
avoided
because
i
really
dont
like
anise
i
think
time
may
have
faded
it
a
bit
to
a
not
that
bad
beer
i
couldnt
get
behind
this
as
much
as
the
other
three
bells
i
had
pale
ale
two
hearted
amber
ale
but
that
wont
stop
me
from
trying
more
bells
well
money
has
been
tight
so
i
havent
had
the
luxury
to
buy
some
good
beer
but
i
decided
to
splurge
for
something
new
beer
pours
darker
than
almost
any
other
beer
i
can
think
of
its
as
dark
as
celebrator
easily
it
may
be
the
darkest
beer
ive
ever
had
smells
of
toffee
and
sweet
roasted
malt
with
maybe
some
chocolate
in
there
taste
is
fantastic
as
one
would
expect
from
bells
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
and
the
chocolate
smell
is
much
more
pronounced
in
the
mouth
it
really
is
a
good
beer
and
im
going
to
savor
this
6
pack
othis
is
a
good
resonably
priced
stout
this
may
be
my
favorite
stout
i
have
had
all
year
o
a
pretty
good
stout
nothing
mindblowing
and
doesnt
really
deliver
on
the
licorice
flavor
but
definitely
a
solid
beer
i
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
a
lot
very
thick
and
very
drinkable
a
good
session
beer
although
maybe
just
a
tad
high
at
6
enjoy
o
i
like
this
beer
but
the
appearance
and
nose
totally
deceived
me
that
being
said
its
still
a
good
beer
that
id
like
to
try
again
o
a
very
good
stout
another
well
done
beer
from
bells
not
sure
what
to
make
of
bells
stout
offerings
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
a
great
brewery
is
a
superlative
stout
and
having
had
expedition
kalamazoo
and
java
all
come
well
short
of
that
distinction
yet
everything
else
ive
had
from
bells
is
invariably
great
i
guess
stouts
just
arent
their
sweet
spot
overall
bells
is
quickly
becoming
my
favourite
brewer
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
with
any
of
their
beers
the
mouthfeel
with
this
beer
was
amazing
and
it
has
a
fantastic
appearance
in
the
glass
the
taste
was
great
and
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
id
buy
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
o
i
love
this
stout
its
not
my
favorite
and
not
my
goto
but
it
is
still
fantastic
the
flavors
meld
perfectly
overall
a
good
well
rounded
drinkable
stout
not
overly
complex
and
i
enjoy
the
licorice
o
solid
but
simple
id
buy
it
again
overal
this
is
a
very
good
stout
smooth
yet
still
big
and
chewy
its
a
mouthful
very
complex
with
bitter
chocolate
hints
of
charred
wood
and
those
anise
notes
maybe
even
some
grape
in
there
too
it
all
leads
to
a
dry
chalky
woody
lingering
finish
pretty
excited
when
a
customer
dropped
this
off
at
the
store
for
us
to
try
the
beer
pours
black
with
brown
around
the
edges
with
an
espresso
head
smells
big
and
roasty
the
taste
has
got
a
lot
going
on
big
ashy
charred
flavors
roasted
coffee
bitter
chocolate
touch
of
licorice
im
not
a
licorice
fan
but
i
like
the
stout
not
something
to
avoid
even
if
you
dont
like
licorice
this
is
a
wonderful
fullbodied
stout
that
im
honored
to
try
outside
of
distribution
bells
come
to
ny
had
this
one
at
the
fountainhead
pours
pitch
black
and
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
licorice
the
taste
is
extremely
roasty
but
there
is
an
astringent
side
that
really
balances
this
brew
i
was
disappointed
that
they
did
not
have
the
expedition
stout
so
i
tried
this
one
instead
it
ended
up
working
out
for
me
overall
great
stout
everything
a
stout
should
be
easy
drinking
but
very
satisfying
overall
this
beer
was
great
despite
my
low
expectations
due
to
the
addition
of
licorice
i
will
seek
this
out
in
the
future
oa
very
decent
stout
though
im
noticing
that
the
flavors
start
to
diminish
the
more
i
drink
making
it
not
something
id
want
to
drink
all
night
long
its
still
a
great
stout
that
i
would
absolutely
recommend
for
any
who
likes
stouts
or
even
those
that
arent
big
fans
my
first
beer
i
had
mixed
feelings
on
it
the
licorice
was
commanding
to
me
as
it
warmed
it
was
less
prominent
a
solid
beer
from
bells
o
tons
of
roasty
goodness
great
representation
of
the
style
i
was
worried
about
this
being
overly
licoricey
but
the
licorice
gives
a
nice
light
note
it
could
be
a
little
more
full
bodied
o
disappointed
with
this
beer
was
looking
forward
to
it
but
i
will
definitely
not
be
seeking
this
out
again
medium
to
full
bodied
with
excessive
carbonation
this
beer
has
great
drinkability
for
a
stout
the
body
is
just
a
little
sticky
and
coating
which
is
just
right
for
the
flavors
and
the
style
on
the
other
hand
the
carbonation
is
so
powerful
it
truly
detracts
from
the
beer
while
it
does
help
to
make
this
beer
more
drinkable
it
is
so
strong
and
fizzy
that
it
covers
the
flavors
when
the
beer
is
held
in
the
mouth
o
very
nice
stout
which
while
not
medium
or
heavy
bodied
and
super
creamy
is
still
creamy
enough
and
thick
enough
that
its
not
a
porter
and
coupled
with
the
licorice
really
add
another
layer
of
character
to
the
beer
worth
trying
and
drinking
more
of
o
a
good
beer
but
the
smell
was
really
the
only
thing
i
found
memorable
about
this
one
overall
a
pretty
straightforward
but
decent
stout
d
another
good
brew
from
bells
pretty
enjoyable
i
would
get
this
brew
again
and
recommend
it
i
suppose
i
was
expecting
more
pronounced
licorice
or
molasses
flavor
given
the
description
of
this
one
but
i
think
bells
did
a
nice
job
in
producing
a
stout
thats
wellbalanced
and
engaging
i
can
come
back
to
this
one
again
and
again
overall
very
drinkable
on
the
sweet
side
for
the
style
barely
any
bitter
o
pretty
good
stout
more
complex
than
some
of
the
other
nonimperial
stouts
ive
had
maybe
went
a
tad
overboard
but
big
kudos
for
doing
something
slightly
different
d
i
do
like
the
licorice
it
gives
the
beers
aroma
something
unique
when
compared
to
other
american
stouts
however
i
found
the
palate
mouthfeel
etc
to
be
sort
of
american
stout
redundant
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
as
blown
away
as
the
masses
pours
a
black
as
hell
color
with
no
head
smells
like
a
rich
milk
chocolate
and
roast
roast
roastiness
tastes
the
same
with
rich
chocolate
flavor
and
coffee
hints
feel
is
super
smooth
and
moderate
to
thick
with
the
slightest
carbonation
creaminess
and
roastiness
come
on
bells
just
fucking
distribute
to
western
ny
already
this
is
really
a
pretty
unique
stout
but
the
licorice
flavors
while
interesting
dont
really
do
it
for
me
but
i
love
the
smoothness
bells
gives
to
their
stouts
and
this
i
can
drink
this
one
easily
i
liked
the
oatmeal
stout
at
the
eccentric
cafe
much
more
than
this
though
overall
another
solid
beer
from
bells
decidedly
drinkable
with
a
wealth
of
flavor
and
aroma
to
keep
things
interesting
everyone
who
can
get
his
all
the
time
im
jealous
revisited
and
tweaked
with
a
2012
bottle
in
nov
2013
paired
with
a
green
flash
double
stout
which
proved
to
have
more
flavor
but
otherwise
was
quite
similar
mouthfeel
is
surprising
this
beer
is
as
rich
and
filling
as
a
double
stout
at
1012
abv
but
without
the
paralyzing
kick
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
stout
that
will
please
the
risimperial
stout
lovers
with
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
as
well
as
the
pint
man
that
could
quaff
a
few
o
nice
semisessionable
and
accessable
stout
jeez
louise
it
looked
like
spent
motor
oil
coming
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
my
glass
i
briefly
had
a
finger
of
deeptan
head
before
it
disappeared
color
was
solid
black
with
zero
light
penetration
nose
was
very
smoky
and
charcoalish
underlain
by
a
dark
chocolate
scent
mouthfeel
was
fairly
full
and
the
roasted
bitterness
had
really
come
to
the
forefront
with
coffee
initially
and
chocolate
following
finish
was
more
like
chocolate
fudge
than
anything
rendering
it
a
dessert
beer
it
held
up
extremely
well
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
not
the
best
from
bells
definitely
would
not
buy
again
oa
solid
stout
with
nice
flavor
and
balance
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
black
color
the
head
was
thick
and
tan
colored
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
roasted
and
has
a
light
chocolate
aroma
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
heavy
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
chocolate
too
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
wasnt
as
thick
as
i
was
hoping
for
overall
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
i
would
gladly
drink
it
again
i
just
feel
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
sampled
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
totally
black
in
color
poured
with
a
rich
beige
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
nice
cap
that
leaves
a
few
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
aromas
smells
creamy
too
thick
and
resinous
feel
in
the
beginning
and
creamy
smooth
toward
the
finish
with
rich
carbonation
dark
roasted
and
chocolate
flavor
up
front
with
dark
malt
flavors
transitioning
to
a
lightly
burnt
malt
flavor
into
the
middle
hop
bitterness
then
comes
alive
with
pleasant
herbal
pine
character
that
intensifies
from
the
middle
to
the
end
dark
maltiness
also
carries
through
to
the
end
along
with
hints
of
black
coffee
and
a
dry
finish
leaves
you
with
a
light
herbal
pine
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
while
o
not
the
best
showing
from
bells
but
id
say
licorice
is
a
hard
flavor
to
balance
in
a
single
style
stout
theres
no
real
bite
to
any
of
the
flavors
and
thats
something
that
really
bothers
me
as
someone
that
is
really
quite
the
flavor
fiend
i
cant
help
but
feel
frustrated
by
a
strong
flavor
ingredient
being
subdued
by
the
nature
of
the
body
feel
and
complimentary
flavors
i
just
dont
understand
why
theyd
bother
with
licorice
if
it
ends
up
being
so
dissonant
in
such
a
light
bodied
stout
perhaps
this
used
to
be
a
classic
or
even
one
of
the
breweries
first
beers
but
it
really
feels
like
a
novelty
just
because
an
ingredient
should
work
on
paper
doesnt
mean
it
works
in
execution
go
big
and
imperial
with
your
licorice
or
risk
being
a
dissonant
and
imbalanced
single
stout
o
glad
i
tried
this
and
very
happy
to
try
some
bells
things
but
this
was
pretty
mediocre
volume
definitely
needs
to
be
turned
up
on
the
flavors
and
their
development
if
the
same
flavors
were
amped
this
would
be
an
easy
b
or
b
as
it
is
hard
to
really
recommend
this
beer
unless
you
like
your
stouts
unusually
light
and
fleeting
for
me
there
is
something
wrong
here
the
alcohol
note
is
slightly
acetone
like
and
fusely
further
the
malt
character
doesnt
have
the
chocolately
coffee
roasty
note
expected
of
the
style
a
nice
stout
i
would
buy
this
one
again
o
this
is
a
decent
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
black
color
very
little
head
or
lacing
roasty
aromas
that
continue
in
the
mouth
with
bitter
hops
coffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
flavors
also
present
medium
mouthfeel
not
too
thick
or
carbonated
modest
abv
allows
for
decent
drinkability
yummy
and
typical
of
the
style
no
surprises
here
just
delivers
the
goods
a
very
nice
stout
indeed
not
too
big
or
over
the
top
gotta
find
myself
a
bottle
of
their
imperial
stout
next
from
the
wide
variation
in
reviews
here
on
ba
it
seems
that
this
brew
is
very
sensitive
to
age
and
whether
its
in
a
bottle
vs
on
tap
i
found
myself
literally
saying
mmm
without
thinking
after
every
few
sips
i
dont
believe
ive
ever
done
that
before
it
was
very
hard
to
put
down
i
know
ill
have
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
of
this
luckily
one
of
my
local
places
does
get
bells
in
overall
a
solid
stout
that
if
they
had
six
packs
around
me
of
i
would
buy
as
an
every
day
stout
overall
a
nice
stout
worth
drinking
at
least
once
overall
this
is
an
excellent
stout
the
roasty
bitterness
blends
well
with
the
slight
sweetness
to
create
good
balance
o
this
is
a
great
year
round
stout
to
scratch
an
itch
for
the
darker
beers
just
solid
simple
brewing
in
this
beer
one
of
the
best
in
the
911
sixer
range
for
me
o
well
this
has
a
definite
following
amongst
bells
lovers
stout
lovers
and
just
plain
ol
beer
lovers
now
i
see
that
its
for
good
reason
i
only
wished
that
this
beer
had
a
bigger
presence
more
abv
thicker
body
bigger
roasts
etc
other
than
that
though
it
has
earned
its
place
in
my
heart
and
mind
as
a
bells
classic
thanks
again
guys
ill
be
sure
to
think
twice
next
time
im
tempted
to
just
walk
by
your
other
offerings
mf
almost
full
bodied
but
creamy
and
smooth
o
definitly
a
drinker
over
and
over
again
good
till
there
aint
no
more
sort
of
a
thick
pour
like
used
motor
oil
into
my
glass
resulting
in
a
two
finger
head
of
moderately
dense
foam
of
light
brown
color
lace
is
somewhat
clingy
color
is
a
30
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
intriguing
with
aromas
of
licorice
currant
honey
coffee
coco
and
lemon
peel
the
taste
well
was
not
quite
a
full
and
robust
as
i
thought
it
would
be
lots
of
flavor
but
not
so
intense
to
knock
my
shoes
off
there
are
flavors
of
coffee
coco
anise
molasses
charred
oak
celery
grapefruitlemonpine
and
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
thick
creamy
and
has
some
pop
from
the
carbonation
a
bit
of
dryingstickiness
on
the
sides
of
my
tongue
and
back
of
my
soft
palate
yes
i
would
like
to
drink
some
more
of
this
brew
but
i
got
the
last
bottle
and
being
at
the
end
of
the
supply
chain
i
can
only
dream
dark
in
color
with
2
fingers
worth
of
tan
head
laced
through
out
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
much
of
a
nose
here
flavor
is
robust
lots
of
burnt
malts
and
strong
coffee
heavier
part
of
medium
thickness
in
mouthfeel
would
definitely
not
be
on
the
top
of
the
stout
style
imo
o
a
very
tasty
brew
i
would
get
it
again
it
it
was
distributed
to
my
state
o
a
very
tasty
stout
4
overall
a
nice
stout
but
i
found
it
lacked
a
bit
of
oomph
well
made
though
and
worth
a
look
a
very
solid
american
stout
lacks
the
bright
hop
flavors
and
aromatics
of
some
american
stouts
but
has
the
characteristically
big
flavors
and
big
roast
this
beer
would
pair
fantastically
with
a
number
of
desserts
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
inky
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
considerable
lacing
throughout
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
taste
is
the
same
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
very
little
in
the
way
of
licorice
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
light
mouthfeel
but
not
unexpected
for
the
moderate
abv
overall
very
drinkable
and
an
excellent
stout
beer
pours
a
thick
black
with
tan
creamy
head
decent
retention
and
nice
lacing
roasted
aromas
of
coffee
and
cocoa
some
char
and
maybe
leather
flavor
is
roasted
coffee
and
some
sort
of
dark
fruitiness
a
really
nice
stout
that
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
a
decent
brew
very
roasty
and
a
bit
one
dimensional
there
is
too
much
out
there
that
i
enjoy
more
for
me
to
go
back
to
this
one
again
o
overall
a
good
to
average
beer
a
little
one
dimensional
but
enjoyable
not
sure
ill
rush
back
to
it
any
time
soon
o
i
know
why
i
used
to
love
this
stuff
i
do
not
know
why
i
havent
got
back
with
this
sooner
now
some
controversy
though
different
styles
and
intents
kalamazoo
is
a
wayyy
better
beer
than
expedition
yes
ive
had
fresh
expedition
yes
ive
had
xyearold
expedition
kalamazoo
ftw
d
mild
carbonation
not
as
sweet
as
many
stouts
nice
o
i
strongly
dislike
licorice
so
i
was
a
little
hesitant
picking
this
up
but
im
happy
to
report
im
not
picking
up
any
licorice
at
all
the
bottle
says
this
is
brewed
with
brewers
licorice
im
not
entirely
sure
if
brewers
licorice
has
a
completely
different
flavor
profile
than
your
standard
old
school
licorice
either
way
im
really
enjoying
this
the
flavors
are
bold
and
straightforward
not
any
complexity
but
this
is
exactly
what
im
looking
for
right
now
a
great
stout
for
a
cold
winter
night
or
in
my
case
a
humid
thursday
night
poured
from
bottle
into
tulip
glass
poured
almost
black
with
a
huge
light
brown
rocky
head
that
lasted
throughout
and
had
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
burnt
cereal
malts
a
leathery
yeast
with
notes
of
molasses
chocolate
and
coffee
it
tasted
mildly
bitter
and
acidic
in
the
beginning
and
finished
with
a
sweetbitter
coffee
flavor
that
stayed
with
you
for
an
average
length
of
time
mouthfeel
was
full
in
body
and
creamy
in
texture
with
a
flat
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
basic
stout
overallnotes
frankly
this
beer
does
all
of
the
important
things
right
dont
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
has
never
been
truer
maybe
the
dark
chocolate
helped
it
taste
better
than
it
really
was
but
no
no
i
just
liked
the
beer
another
strong
one
from
bells
i
have
had
my
eye
on
this
stout
for
a
while
and
i
picked
up
a
single
recently
during
my
last
trip
to
save
on
i
poured
the
12oz
glass
into
a
snifter
glass
to
find
a
deep
black
body
with
a
tan
one
inch
head
that
left
no
lacing
around
my
glass
the
aroma
was
great
with
hints
of
dried
fruits
roasted
malts
coffee
and
hints
of
chocolate
the
taste
was
great
the
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
are
there
like
you
would
expect
but
they
way
the
licorice
is
worked
into
the
flavor
its
great
the
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
heavy
and
chewy
side
but
mellows
out
nicely
and
is
enjoyable
to
drink
the
carbonation
and
creaminess
of
the
beer
and
very
well
balanced
overall
this
beer
met
my
expectations
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
will
defiantly
pick
this
one
up
again
o
a
nice
wellcrafted
stout
by
bells
they
seem
to
make
nothing
but
good
beers
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
very
easy
drinking
a
good
beginner
stout
was
a
little
skeptical
about
the
licorice
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
poured
black
with
a
small
carmel
head
roasts
on
the
nose
but
not
as
strong
as
i
like
nice
balance
between
creamy
and
carbonation
very
nice
chocolate
and
malt
although
not
as
much
malt
as
i
was
expecting
and
i
expected
more
licorice
but
im
ok
with
the
subtlety
finish
lingers
of
roasts
and
coffee
very
nicely
balanced
id
prefer
a
little
more
umph
from
it
as
far
as
abv
i
think
that
would
add
to
the
overall
but
all
in
all
very
nice
beer
the
taste
is
a
beautiful
thing
with
a
dry
chocolate
and
roast
mix
thats
very
full
bodied
and
smooth
some
faint
licorice
notes
but
mostly
it
has
an
almost
ris
level
of
roast
and
burnt
qualities
that
i
really
like
easy
drinking
and
tasty
stout
o
this
is
a
solid
refreshing
stout
the
flavors
were
solid
roasted
malt
and
dark
notes
nothing
too
adventurous
delicious
brew
didnt
blow
my
mind
but
very
good
and
will
certainly
drink
it
in
the
future
o
so
far
my
second
favorite
stout
excellently
crafted
obsidian
still
holds
the
top
for
me
but
this
would
be
a
great
substitute
od
i
would
call
this
a
good
session
stout
not
too
heavy
and
the
flavor
is
a
good
balance
of
sweet
bitter
and
trace
smoke
i
will
be
picking
this
up
again
overall
drinkability
hmmm
i
think
this
would
be
good
with
steak
but
by
itself
its
a
nice
beer
to
sip
savor
and
finish
the
evening
with
but
just
one
is
enough
per
evening
its
very
intense
in
flavor
which
is
good
but
by
the
end
im
pleasantly
sated
i
think
this
would
also
be
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
desert
especially
something
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
weak
this
feels
way
too
carbonated
id
like
something
a
bit
smoother
for
sure
maybe
a
bit
more
thickness
too
let
it
sit
for
a
while
to
let
the
carbonation
mellow
and
it
becomes
more
enjoyable
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
this
is
a
great
unique
stout
that
i
highly
recommend
o
a
less
bold
stout
a
nice
starter
to
your
stout
night
overall
its
a
good
but
not
great
beer
i
probably
wont
think
to
have
to
have
this
beer
again
o
roaster
than
i
typically
like
in
the
style
and
i
feel
like
the
smoke
note
is
a
little
unbalanced
but
not
a
bad
beer
o
this
is
a
good
stout
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
than
a
normal
stout
i
enjoyed
the
feel
of
it
and
the
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
fullbodied
and
very
smooth
it
has
even
more
of
those
dark
roasted
malt
flavors
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
initially
it
delivers
black
currant
and
roasted
malt
but
it
quickly

the

enjoyable
to

drinks
pretty
well
a
good
offering
from
bells
o
quite
happy
with
this
beer
glad
that
the
coffee
doesnt
overwhelm
the
beer
since
i
am
not
a
fan
of
coffee
beers
not
my
favorite
stout
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
away
doverall
this
a
a
great
stout
lots
of
good
flavors
come
out
very
drinkable
great
smell
and
taste
goes
down
soo
smooth
love
this
stout
o
i
thought
i
wasnt
going
to
like
this
with
the
black
licorice
and
all
but
its
not
as
dominant
as
i
thought
itd
be
the
mouth
could
be
thicker
but
this
is
drinkable
curious
to
try
other
stout
offerings
from
bells
and
their
brews
in
general
overall
solid
good
light
stout
very
nice
and
enjoyable
easy

you

this

overall
all
in

a
very
solid

good

great
smells
and
a
great
taste
that
lingers
a

go
to
for

as
stoutsporters
go

little
retention

has
plenty
of
roasted

giving

is

to
the

theres
the
dark

flavour
with
toasty
cocoa
notes
full
bodied
mouthfeel
well
rounded
with
a
creamy

and
a

a
decent
stout
with
a
unique
overall
taste
of
licorice
well
priced
and
another
quality
beer
from
bells
lineup
o
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
rises
above
average
by
being
more
complex
than
a
lot
of
its
competitors
a
great
year
round
beer
overall
a
cool
new
addition
to
an
old
style
one
of
the
few
times
ive
seen
a
cool
twist
on
a
stout
overalla
very
enjoybale
drinking
experience
this
stout
is
lively
and
flavorfull
and
dances
on
your
palate
i
am
not
a
huge
stout
fan
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
out
there
and
definitely
a
23
pinter
d
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
not
great
but
pretty
good
for
me
the
charredsmokey
flavor
was
kind
of
overpowering
it
wasnt
bad
but
could
have
been
a
little
less
of
a
punch
to
the
palate
o
a
pretty
good
beer
one
of
my
favorite
bells
beers
and
worth
having
again
overalltwo
hearted
oberon
and
now
this
bells
makes
very
nice
sessionable
beers
for
people
with
different
tastes
please
distribute
to
texas
overall
this
is
a
decent
but
slightly
unbalanced
stout
at
6
abv
this
is
quite
sessionable
but
not
overly
flavorful
enough
that
i
need
to
revisit
worth
a
go
but
not
necessary
to
sample
o
really
nice
easy
drinking
stout
you
could
definitely
have
a
couple
of
these
o
very
nice
beer
easy
drinker
with
a
bundle
of
flavor
i
still
dont
get
the
chocolate
that
everyone
else
is
talking
about
or
the
brewers
licorice
this
is
the
ideal
american
stout
without
adding
anything
to
it
they
did
everything
just
right
for
the
style
imo
not
enough
breweries
make
this
simple
tasty
yet
overlooked
style
i
could
drink
this
anytime
of
year
and
i
would
definatly
recommend
it
a
nice
session
beer
good
stout
first
stout
ive
had
from
bells
looking
forward
to
trying
more
bells
makes
another
great
beer
in
this
kalamazoo
stout
one
thing
great
about
bells
is
that
they
are
not
a
one
trick
pony
but
put
time
and
effort
into
all
their
beers
to
be
one
of
the
best
hand
crafted
breweries
this
stout
pours
jet
black
into
my
pint
glass
with
a
little
creamy
head
chocolate
and
sweet
smell
either
hops
or
alcohol
is
very
pleasant
hoppy
chocolate
taste
to
a
bitter
hazelnut
coffee
flavor
you
can
feels
the
hops
on
tongue
and
is
an
easy
drinker
love
this
michigan
beer
quite
enjoyable
another
great
brew
from
bells
which
i
love
is
in
my
hometown
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
a
very
good
one
i
have
to
say
i
love
expedition
aged
but
fresh
this
just
does
it
for
me
id
buy
again
d
a
very
solid
stout
and
one
that
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
regularly
if
it
were
available
to
me
lots
of
different
flavors
going
on
but
overall
its
not
very
potent
easy
to
drink
m
just
what
i
expected
from
seeing
how
much
of
that
foam
clung
to
the
side
of
the
glass
big
and
chewy
with
a
dry
finish
leaving
you
craving
the
next
sip
mouthfeel
is
buttery
creamy
and
thick
and
it
works
well
for
this
beer
drinkability
is
quite
good
due
to
the
lack
of
any
overpowering
flavors
and
the
buttery
character
in
the
middle
makes
me
want
to
keep
drinking
this
finish
is
just
bitter
enough
to
get
the
palate
ready
for
the
next
sip
as
well
this
is
a
really
good
regular
stout
and
its
nice
to
have
one
of
these
while
everyone
chases
big
huge
enormous
stouts
all
the
time
myself
included
o
overall
this
a
a
decent
stout
it
has
all
the
makings
of
being
really
explosive
you
can
taste
it
on
your
tongue
that
it
wants
to
be
better
than
it
is
the
sweetness
hits
a
little
too
strong
on
the
tongue
at
first
and
controls
the
feel
of
the
beer
from
there
very
sweet
great
brew
overall
fun
to
drink
easy
to
appreciate
would
definitely
rec
to
anyone
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
smoke
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
to
add
some
balance
it
lacks
any
overwhelming
flavor
per
say
but
its
a
good
heavy
balance
body
is
big
and
its
a
smooth
beer
going
down
particularly
with
a
reasonable
abv
d
a
solid
beer
especially
for
the
abv
its
a
good
near
sessionable
beer
and
i
plan
to
get
this
again
also
its
one
of
the
best
regular
stouts
in
regards
to
character
most
stouts
seem
lacking
in
one
way
or
another
but
this
one
has
all
you
could
ask
of
a
6
stout
cheers
d
due
to
its
lighter
body
and
only
6
0
abv
this
is
something
you
could
have
a
few
of
and
still
keep
your
wits
about
you
this
would
be
a
great
coldweather
beer
unfortunately
i
could
never
find
bells
beer
when
i
lived
in
syracuse
and
i
dont
have
too
much
time
to
drink
big
winter
beers
in
the
florida
heat
d
this
is
a
pretty
approachable
stout
in
a
world
filled
in
ris
this
provides
a
nice
lower
abv
alternative
another
excellent
offering
from
bells
ive
enjoyed
everything
ive
had
from
them
and
this
one
was
no
different
d
i
have
been
too
busy
with
ba
stouts
so
this
one
went
down
very
easily
d
nice
and
drinkable
at
at
6
abv
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
solid
everyday
stout
this
seems
very
comparable
to
the
sn
stout
actually
however
less
hopped
this
is
a
good
go
to
beer
this
beer
was
definitely
drinkable
but
one
was
enough
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
i
was
also
unable
to
locate
a
bottle
dating
so
i
have
no
idea
if
this
is
fresh
or
not
very
drinkable
the
beer
goes
down
very
easy
with
moderate
alcohol
you
can
enjoy
these
all
night
long
d
ive
had
better
stouts
from
bells
its
just
decent
to
me
d
i
could
kill
a
few
of
these
fairly
quick
due
to
the
smooth
goodness
of
them
i
would
absolutely
drink
this
again
the
cpj
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
glass
and
will
certainly
be
picking
this
up
again
glad
i
gave
it
a
second
chance
after
picking
it
up
initially
and
being
disappointed
maybe
i
was
expecting
something
much
more
similar
to
an
imperial
stout
this
is
a
totally
different
but
equally
enjoyable
style
d
very
very
drinkable
the
thinness
of
the
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
and
it
carries
the
abv
well
a
daring
beer
complex
but
a
bit
too
much
not
a
chore
to
finish
but
kinda
close
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
especially
if
you
like
black
coffee
or
licorice
not
my
drink
of
choice
but
definitely
a
great
beer
pours
very
very
dark
a
reddish
tint
around
the
edges
a
small
amount
of
brown
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
smells
roasty
and
chocolatey
lots
of
bitterness
on
the
nose
from
the
dark
chocolate
tastes
sweet
and
malty
lots
of
roasted
flavours
and
a
tough
of
licorice
backing
it
all
up
coffee
and
licorice
blend
well
thick
solid
mouthfeel
well
carbonated
fairly
drinkable
but
its
a
pretty
low
abv
drinkability
well
crafted
and
complex
without
being
huge
and
in
your
face
what
a
delicious
beer
i
think
you
can
sip
this
for
an
evening
and
i
think
you
put
34
back
in
an
evening
as
well
its
actually
pretty
versitle
thanks
to
a
wonderful
taste
profile
combined
with
a
reasonable
abv
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
id
go
for
an
expedition
stout
over
this
every
time
but
this
is
a
little
cheaper
and
easier
to
find
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
this
is
a
very
flavorful
stout
for
6
loads
of
roasted
flavors
as
well
i
expect
these
flavors
in
a
ris
so
it
is
really
nice
to
see
in
a
lower
abv
brew
caramel
and
buttery
notes
come
out
more
as
the
beer
warms
which
adds
an
odd
flavor
so
i
prefer
to
drink
this
stout
a
bit
colder
doutstanding
especially
for
this
style
the
low
abv
definitely
helps
along
with
the
good
but
not
overly
complex
taste
poured
almost
black
with
a
huge
light
brown
rocky
head
that
lasted
throughout
and
had
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
burnt
cereal
malts
a
leathery
yeast
with
notes
of
molasses
chocolate
and
coffee
it
tasted
mildly
bitter
and
acidic
in
the
beginning
and
finished
with
a
sweetbitter
coffee
flavor
that
stayed
with
you
for
an
average
length
of
time
mouthfeel
was
full
in
body
and
creamy
in
texture
with
a
flat
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
basic
stout
hey
my
labels
different
im
sorry
its
all
i
had
to
start
with
ill
try
better
next
time
no
matter
it
pours
sleek
obsidian
that
seems
to
want
to
be
tinged
with
either
ruby
or
garnet
but
just
cant
quite
get
it
done
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
light
char
a
very
light
touch
of
anise
and
a
sprinkling
of
dark
chocolate
though
there
may
be
more
listed
there
the
roast
is
king
and
everyone
round
town
knows
it
the
taste
mimics
the
smell
with
roasty
dominance
continuing
however
here
the
dark
chocolate
and
anise
shine
through
a
bit
more
along
with
a
dull
cut
of
coffee
in
the
back
room
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
stout
kinda
onedimensional
and
then
some
but
it
definitely
hits
the
spot
when
a
stout
is
desired
overall
a
pretty
decent
stout
nice
and
creamy
though
the
burnt
coffee
aftertaste
is
a
bit
unappealing
d
good
but
i
am
not
a
licorce
fan
the
amount
of
body
and
flavor
are
impressive
for
a
6
brew
pretty
substantial
beer
and
this
one
seems
to
have
aged
quite
well
although
any
licorice
is
barely
detectable
and
only
found
because
i
was
looking
for
it
pours
very
dark
brown
which
ends
black
once
settled
in
the
snifter
the
tan
colored
head
fluffs
to
about
an
inch
and
slowly
settles
the
nose
offers
scents
of
toasty
malt
and
light
coffee
a
calm
sweet
scent
is
also
present
the
taste
is
bold
and
toasty
the
roasted
and
sweet
malts
are
balanced
well
in
combination
with
a
subtle
coffeecocoa
taste
that
offers
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
tickle
the
palate
this
this
stout
is
very
drinkable
due
to
a
well
hidden
abv
and
great
taste
poured
dark
as
night
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
thin
caramel
head
quickly
vanished
but
created
a
light
brown
ring
surrounding
the
glass
very
good
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
for
the
nose
which
gets
enhanced
on
the
taste
roasty
chocolate
malts
on
the
tongue
make
for
a
real
easy
drink
a
slight
bitter
finish
but
not
filling
at
all
pretty
good
lil
stout
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
again
though
could
really
use
some
more
sweetness
in
my
opinion
vanilla
chocolate
or
something
d
though
this
stout
is
a
bit
too
coffeeey
for
my
likings
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
complex
enough
for
my
likings
it
was
perfect
with
a
chocolatebased
dessert
d
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
because
it
isnt
very
filling
overall
anoth
bells
to
be
very
happy
with
has
a
light
mouthfeel
which
makes
the
drinkibility
high
this
is
a
highly
complex
brew
good
beer
would
pick
this
up
again
drinkability
is
great
over
all
very
easy
to
drink
with
good
tastes
and
aromas
multiples
should
be
a
must
overall
probably
my
favorite
american
stout
another
great
beer
from
bells
this
is
going
to
be
a
regular
in
my
rotation
highly
recommended
only
negative
here
is
the
lame
label
dsmooth
drinker
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
a
winner
d
one
of
my
favs
from
bells
will
definitely
be
having
this
one
again
exceptional
example
of
an
american
stout
tons
of
flavor
with
excellent
balance
doverall
this
was
a
disappointment
from
a
brewery
that
has
gained
high
accolades
the
flavor
is
closer
to
the
classic
dry
stout
profile
it
has
notes
of
espresso
and
faint
nuttiness
theres
a
blend
of
hop
and
burnt
toast
taste
in
the
finish
which
lingers
long
after
the
swallow
the
body
light
to
moderate
and
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
a
good
but
not
great
stout
mouthfeeldrinkability
full
bodied
and
creamy
a
flavorful
beer
with
a
wonderful
smell
but
i
couldnt
manage
to
drink
too
many
of
these
even
though
the
abv
is
not
crazy
high
its
not
one
that
id
have
back
to
back
this
is
a
one
at
a
time
as
the
coffee
keeps
me
satisfied
at
one
could
certainly
drink
this
another
day
an
overall
good
brew
this
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
tan
head
that
fades
rapidly
the
smell
gives
way
strongly
to
smoked
malts
coffee
notes
exist
behind
the
prevalent
smoke
notes
and
lend
to
an
overall
interesting
aroma
the
main
taste
that
comes
through
is
char
now
i
know
how
that
sounds
not
too
pleasant
but
with
the
smoke
nose
because
it
doesnt
come
up
in
the
taste
its
not
too
bad
the
remaining
flavors
are
rich
caramel
notes
and
a
backer
of
roasted
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
bitter
and
astringent
on
the
palate
for
a
stout
the
body
is
pretty
damn
good
but
this
doesnt
sit
too
well
on
the
tongue
with
out
messing
with
it
it
has
the
strong
bitterness
and
acidity
of
a
strong
cup
of
black
coffee
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
overall
is
a
still
good
and
i
would
not
turn
this
beer
down
if
it
were
offered
to
me
at
a
later
date
really
good
example
of
stout
thickcreamy
and
bursting
with
rich
dark
stout
flavors
highly
recommended
d
not
too
thick
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
but
heavy
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
pretty
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
minimal
carbonation
on
the
palate
there
is
a
nice
chocolaty
midpalate
flavor
after
the
initial
mild
sweetness
the
bitterness
in
this
beer
is
practically
perfect
a
very
good
beer
all
around
d
neither
dry
nor
sweet
with
a
firmly
dark
dark
roast
character
just
impressive
depth
and
breadth
to
its
flavor
profile
it
doesnt
really
too
strongly
on
any
one
note
and
only
hints
at
the
harsh
rough
things
dark
malts
can
bring
mostly
it
is
smooth
robust
and
deeply
darkly
roasted
rather
cozy
chad
d
a
very
drinkable
solid
goto
stout
i
like
it
better
than
the
double
cream
d
this
is
actually
one
of
my
goto
beers
when
i
want
a
good
all
around
american
stout
d
this
is
a
mighty
taste
explosion
on
the
palate
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
have
a
good
number
of
these
unlike
most
big
huge
stouts
that
pack
as
much
flavor
as
this
one
nice
job
bells
on
this
one
d
good
flavor
and
carbonation
and
a
relatively
dry
finish
make
this
a
very
sessionable
stout
d
down
right
delicious
this
one
kinda
blew
me
away
was
just
expecting
an
average
beer
and
got
a
really
wonderful
one
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
this
and
definitely
wont
be
the
last
d
great
drink
with
sweetness
and
bitterness
combined
sweeter
beers
tend
to
make
me
thirstier
not
always
a
bad
thing
good
balance
d
a
very
solid
stout
especially
if
you
like
yours
on
the
bitter
side
poure
jet
black
from
the
bottle
with
a
tight
1
inch
tan
head
bottle
says
stout
brewed
with
licourice
but
the
smell
of
this
beer
off
the
bat
is
coffee
and
roasted
malt
maybe
the
licorice
is
in
the
taste
taste
is
roasted
malt
bitter
cocoa
and
coffee
with
perhaps
a
small
amount
of
licorice
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
but
it
finished
dry
do
that
helped
the
beer
a
bit
drinkability
is
good
not
my
favorite
stout
from
bells
definately
prefer
the
special
double
milk
from
them
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
overall
i
am
a
fan
of
bitter
stouts
though
a
dark
black
opaque
color
with
a
beige
half
inch
head
that
stays
there
and
doesnt
move
the
rich
aroma
of
coffee
chocolate
and
a
little
tickle
of
licrorice
at
the
end
the
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
malt
then
moving
to
a
sweet
and
tangy
licorice
flavor
blending
to
a
coffee
bitterness
that
stays
there
till
the
end
that
is
smacked
by
the
quick
taste
of
licrorice
at
the
end
the
look
makes
think
this
is
thick
and
syrupy
but
in
fact
it
is
the
exact
opposite
thin
and
watery
it
does
gain
weight
gradually
but
never
becoming
what
you
would
think
the
palate
is
left
with
a
tongue
smacking
dryness
that
stays
there
for
some
time
this
beer
has
some
drinkable
characteristics
a
seductive
and
inviting
look
the
aroma
and
taste
are
solid
what
one
would
expect
but
the
feel
is
inconsistent
the
finish
is
dry
making
up
for
the
texture
yet
it
is
still
a
solid
beer
d
nice
stout
try
this
fine
bells
sample
could
have
more
than
a
few
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
the
licorice
is
not
my
favorite
candy
flavor
but
i
enjoy
it
in
small
amounts
i
actually
pick
up
more
coffee
then
licorice
for
some
reaso
drinkability
an
excellent
american
stout
very
indicative
of
the
style
affordably
priced
and
not
over
done
this
is
the
perfect
dark
beer
for
a
cold
winter
night
pours
into
a
black
beer
with
a
tan
head
that
has
very
good
retention
excellent
lacing
and
moderate
carbonation
the
smell
is
of
licorice
roasted
malts
faint
scent
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
is
licorice
followed
by
some
floral
hops
some
chocolate
toffee
and
coffee
notes
the
after
taste
is
licorice
balanced
with
a
mix
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
that
is
nicely
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
soft
creamy
feel
that
is
also
thick
and
chewy
at
the
same
time
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
is
now
one
of
my
favorites
after
trying
it
for
the
first
time
this
is
a
must
try
stout
for
any
beer
lover
that
likes
a
good
beer
d
very
pours
black
with
a
tan
head
about
1
finger
high
really
dark
in
appearance
cant
see
through
it
which
is
classy
for
a
stout
lacing
quickly
sticks
to
glass
but
falls
away
quickly
too
smells
of
sweet
coffee
hints
of
licorice
stronger
licorice
on
second
sniff
tastes
good
and
solid
like
i
would
expect
from
a
stout
sweet
coffee
taste
with
undertones
of
licorice
and
caramel
this
is
very
tasty
has
a
thick
mouthfeel
with
nice
carbonation
goes
down
solid
tastes
fantastic
i
really
like
this
stout
its
a
nice
twist
on
this
variety
of
beer
tastey
would
definitely
drink
this
again
and
i
cant
wait
i
think
i
will
have
another
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
overall
impression
good
stuff
check
this
one
out
if
you
get
the
chance
nice
chocolate
stout
appearance
light
coffee
bean

somewhat
unique
for
reasons
i
cant
quite
point
out
tastes
of
strong
middlepalate
malt
more
malt
than
coffee
which
isnt
typical
of
a
stout
light
body
but
full
flavor
lingering
malt
bitterness
a
different
kind
of
stout
with
a
burnt
malt
and
a
lighter
illusory
complex
flavor
a
pleasure
to
drink
notes
batch
9984
really
enjoyed
this
a
great
stout
and
just
what
i
was
hoping
for
definitely
worth
picking
up
really
balanced
and
a
joy
to
drink
moreys
bottom
line
a
well
made
and
easy
drinking
stout
i
love
two
hearted
but
have
been
a
little
less
impressed
with
a
few
other
of
bells
offerings
however
this
is
another
good
one
taste
kind
of
bland
first
entering
the
mouth
but
a
distinct
malty
stout
flavor
takes
over
in
the
middle
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
coming
in
to
mix
things
up
mild
spice
and
dark
fruit
in
the
finish
with
smokiness
and
bitterness
very
present
in
the
aftertaste
journey
along
the
palate
is
slightly
dirty
and
prickly
but
theres
a
certain
creaminess
to
the
body
and
mouthfeel
at
the
same
time
like
many
of
bells
beers
this
strikes
me
as
decent
and
above
average
but
nothing
mindblowing
too
dirtybitter
for
my
taste
probably
but
you
could
do
worse
other
reviews
mention
licorice
but
i
really
have
to
look
for
that
consciously
to
even
faintly
detect
it
good
head
retention
and
one
of
the
foamiest
stickiest
sheets
of
lacing
ive
seen
in
a
while
all
in
all
b
at
best
decentish
but
not
a
personal
favorite
im
a
fan
but
not
going
to
be
craving
this
tomorrow
d
this
is
a
very
good
stout
mouthfeel
is
excellent
that
alone
is
enough
to
have
me
come
back
to
this
one
flavors
are
good
and
blended
well
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
d
quite
the
tasty
american
stout
complete
with
the
herbal
semifruity
bitterness
of
american
hops
married
to
a
darkroasted
creamy
and
bittersweet
malt
blend
that
warms
with
its
6
abv
fullbodied
and
roasted
indeed
the
kalamazoo
stout
is
a
very
good
traditional
american
stout
drinkability
this
beer
could
get
me
in
trouble
truly
an
outstanding
beer
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
could
make
a
night
or
two
out
of
this
all
too
easy
i
can
see
myself
sitting
by
the
fireplace
with
this
all
night
long
d
a
stout
that
lends
itself
more
toward
the
savory
than
the
sweet
dryness
is
a
dominant
sensory
quality
found
here
becoming
relentless
by
the
finish
qualities
of
this
beer
allow
it
to
stand
out
from
other
american
exportstyle
stouts
which
makes
it
worth
investigating
even
if
frequent
return
visits
are
unlikely
cheers
drinkability
the
flavor
is
bold
and
invigorating
drinking
a
bottle
for
breakfast
sounds
like
a
good
idea
i
am
impressed
and
also
a
little
frightened
by
the
prospect
of
drinking
bells
java
stout
which
must
be
pretty
sinister
if
it
is
more
coffee
flavored
than
this
d
this
is
high
for
me
it
is
a
simple
yet
effective
beer
nice
abv
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
hearty
and
full
bodied
it
is
big
but
not
heavy
going
down
with
little
effort
it
tickles
as
it
goes
down
a
really
delicious
stout
drinkability
good
after
dinner
not
more
than
one
i
like
this
stout
an
awful
lot
because
it
reminds
me
of
boulevard
bully
porter
only
not
as
good
because
bully
porter
is
less
sweet
features
some
heavy
hops
and
is
even
more
roasted
regardless
bells
has
opted
for
something
restrained
here
and
they
succeed
this
is
a
beer
you
will
always
be
happy
to
drink
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
smell
is
roasted
coffee
with
a
deep
earthiness
and
a
hint
of
the
licorice
taste
is
dense
and
roasted
with
a
bitter
base
nicely
complex
the
feel
all
the
while
is
complex
too
dry
yet
effervescent
drinkability
is
above
average
a
unique
brew
thats
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
medium
full
with
a
level
of
carbonation
which
lends
a
little
bit
of
creaminess
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
with
the
only
ding
against
it
being
the
lasting
roast
after
the
sip
is
done
i
find
this
character
in
many
but
not
all
stouts
and
i
dont
find
it
very
pleasant
overall
this
is
a
really
great
stout
readily
available
and
with
a
great
flavor
profile
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
d
very
good
across
the
board
but
just
a
little
to
roasted
for
me
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
brutality
to
it
one
is
enough
to
damage
the
tongue
from
sampling
another
beer
great
stout
though
d
not
hard
to
put
down
but
it
isnt
exactly
my
favorite
stout
however
its
a
decent
one
that
is
worth
picking
up
every
now
and
again
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
thick
black
with
a
small
tan
head
that
turns
into
a
cap
with
some
great
lacing
smell
is
burnt
sugar
roasted
malts
sweet
black
licorice
spicy
hops
taste
is
spicy
hops
and
roasted
malts
up
front
some
burnt
flavors
coffee
and
licorice
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
and
rich
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
clean
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
easily
my
favorite
american
stout
right
up
there
with
shakespeare
stout
i
miss
you
bells
a
lot
poured
a
nice
very
very
dark
brown
had
a
decent
tan
head
on
it
that
lasted
for
just
a
little
bit
before
falling
and
leaving
just
a
little
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
smelled
of
dark
malts
chocolate
and
molasses
tasted
of
chocolate
molasses
toffee
and
a
hint
of
coffee
possibly
decent
carbonation
with
a
mediumheavy
body
coats
the
mouth
nicely
and
really
gives
you
a
chance
to
taste
it
i
really
like
this
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
the
time
great
job
bells
this
one
pours
the
darkest
of
browns
with
the
slightest
khaki
head
which
quickly
dissipated
it
smells
rich
and
sweet
as
of
molasses
it
tastes
bold
and
rich
very
coffeejava
like
it
is
rather
sweet
but
appealingly
so
it
drinks
smoothly
and
medium
bodied
it
has
subtle
carbonation
but
has
an
appealing
mouthfeel
this
one
didnt
miss
where
most
craft
american
stouts
miss
its
very
drinkable
a
great
american
stout
probably
one
of
my
new
favorites
overall
im
pleasantly
surprised
with
how
good
this
is
i
dont
know
why
bells
always
delivers
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
with
just
enough
character
and
certainly
something
i
would
like
to
enjoy
again
normal
pour
into
a
pint
glass
leaves
2
fingers
of
mocha
colored
head
with
light
lacing
somewhat
muted
scents
maybe
some
roasted
malts
some
dark
fruits
as
well
the
taste
is
much
more
pronounced
than
the
nose
malty
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
upfront
also
some
semi
sweet
chocolate
which
is
followed
by
licorice
fruity
flavors
on
the
finish
complex
and
well
balanced
maybe
just
a
touch
thin
in
the
mouth
otherwise
another
nice
offering
from
bells
brewery
d
this
is
one
tasty
brew
im
ashamed
that
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
it
d
well
i
did
like
it
and
may
pick
up
a
six
pack
in
the
future
but
it
defiantly
treated
me
better
than
the
batch
9000
soild
stout
drinkabilty
high
id
love
a
case
of
this
but
ive
never
seen
this
around
til
i
hit
a
bottle
shop
on
a
trip
i
could
see
drinking
46
of
these
if
i
didnt
watch
it
has
everything
youd
want
in
a
regular
stout
good
but
there
is
some
better
stuff
around
for
sure
32
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
without
dipping
into
the
imperials
a
very
solid
brew
and
one
i
will
purchase
again
and
again
drink
well
my
friends
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresh
one
now
too
just
to
see
if
the
freshness
would
make
a
change
in
the
appearance
and
taste
one
of
the
most
flavorful
regular
stout
ive
ever
had
cant
believe
i
hadnt
reviewed
it
yet
as
ive
gone
through
a
number
of
sixers
through
the
years
and
will
continue
to
do
so
fantastic
stuff
d
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
by
a
campfire
drinkability
is
limited
somewhat
by
the
bitterness
but
its
tasty
and
pretty
well
balanced
nice
representation
of
the
american
stout
serving
type
bottle
to
be
fair
if
i
didnt
like
smoky
beers
the
taste
would
probably
have
turned
me
off
given
my
bias
i
give
it
a
b
d
i
would
stick
to
this
as
a
goto
stout
as
well
as
recommend
to
a
person
willing
to
expand
their
styles
given
the
style
and
abv
this
is
a
very
solid
single
stout
tally
another
for
bells
d
good
drinkability
i
would
get
sick
of
it
after
a
few
or
so
it
does
drink
fairly
easily
though
d
really
nice
i
also
drank
this
in
a
stout
tasting
of
14
different
stouts
i
setup
this
beer
was
ranked
2
second
only
to
bells
expedition
d
moderate
good
with
mexican
food
and
any
cooler
evening
adventure
d
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
of
beer
its
smooth
and
drinkable
yet
very
complex
bells
beers
rarely
disappoint
me
i
wish
bells
distribution
channel
would
bring
it
to
the
west
coast
so
that
i
can
enjoy
these
beers
more
often
overall
this
one
damn
tasty
beer
bells
set
the
benchmark
for
stouts
with
this
brew
this
beer
is
great
example
of
not
going
overboard
just
a
great
stout
overall
and
one
of
my
favorites
a
classic
example
of
focusing
on
staying
true
to
the
style
rather
then
breaking
the
mold
dfull
bodiedfull
flavored
american
stout
extremely
sessionable
extremelyflavorful
as
far
as
stouts
go
i
dont
think
this
would
be
among
my
top
choices
as
the
chocolate
is
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
for
me
and
its
just
too
thin
pretty
average
d
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
i
have
to
say
this
beer
tasted
off
and
was
not
harmonious
at
all
a
very
solid
stout
fairly
heavy
but
its
flavors
and
complexity
are
what
one
would
expect
out
of
a
good
american
stout
overall
i
would
compare
all
other
american
stouts
to
this
one
bells
really
went
to
work
on
this
american
crafted
piece
of
excellence
for
being
an
ipa
fan
and
mostly
that
this
brew
is
great
for
a
change
of
pace
i
highly
suggest
you
all
to
give
this
a
try
d
awesome
stout
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
tasty
fantastic
finish
to
my
around
the
world
tour
of
a
bells
variety
pack
d
not
as
challenging
as
some
imperial
stouts
so
its
very
approachable
d
a
must
try
could
drink
this
again
d
about
as
drinkable
as
they
come
there
is
an
overall
sense
of
several
flavors
vying
for
the
lead
in
this
one
not
exactly
reaching
an
accord
this
could
be
distracting
taken
in
whole
with
the
onoff
body
this
probably
decreases
the
repeat
samesession
drinkability
but
nonetheless
i
enjoyed
kalamazoo
stout
and
will
not
have
a
problem
finishing
the
other
five
and
i
will
buy
it
again
a
very
good
everyday
stout
d
great
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
stouts
nah
this
is
my
favorite
d
very
approachable
easy
to
drink
stout
im
not
crazy
about
it
but
its
good
d
easy
and
tasty
however
a
bit
filling
after
a
few
d
decent
overall
would
love
to
see
an
imperial
version
of
this
sometime
body
is
lacking
and
falls
apart
at
times
d
this
one
was
quite
the
mixed
bag
for
me
the
appearance
and
aroma
were
great
the
taste
was
middle
of
the
road
but
confusing
but
it
fell
apart
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
overall
i
found
this
one
rather
unpleasant
and
slightly
off
putting
d
a
delicious
stout
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
and
another
success
from
bells
all
the
same
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
every
once
in
a
while
definitely
one
to
pick
up
as
a
single
but
i
dont
know
if
id
grab
a
sixpack
pours
pitch
black
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
that
diminishes
rather
quickly
i
smell
some
very
sweet
chocolate
scents
lots
of
chocolate
some
sweet
malts
and
maybe
just
a
tiny
bit
of
hoppiness
this
taste
is
definitely
highly
chocolatey
tasting
tons
of
sweet
chocolate
and
vanilla
dancing
around
on
my
palate
i
also
get
maybe
the
slightest
little
bit
of
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
this
sure
is
delicious
though
the
mouthfeel
on
this
is
a
bit
light
its
not
watered
down
or
anything
but
it
could
use
maybe
just
a
tad
more
body
to
it
the
drinkability
is
very
high
due
to
how
tasty
and
light
the
mouthfeel
is
this
beer
is
amazing
everything
that
i
want
in
a
straightup
stout
d
a
lighter
stout
not
really
sure
where
the
licorice
is
coming
in
to
play
maybe
its
that
tingly
feeling
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
d
not
a
huge
fan
the
feel
throws
me
off
a
lot
and
the
licorice
is
a
flavor
im
not
used
to
dominating
a
stout
like
this
dont
think
id
get
again
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
but
as
i
would
always
personally
do
i
wouldnt
drink
this
with
food
at
least
not
with
anything
very
heavy
or
filling
i
think
you
would
do
just
fine
drinking
one
or
two
of
these
by
themselves
d
are
you
kidding
me
i
could
drink
these
all
night
and
for
the
price
i
just
might
do
that
very
soon
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
very
smooth
and
drinkable
quite
complex
for
a
standard
stout
yet
very
inviting
bells
puts
out
many
solid
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
this
is
a
very
potent
drink
which
almost
comes
off
as
an
imperial
or
experimental
stout
though
it
is
technically
a
standard
american
stout
it
is
quite
cheap
and
widely
available
in
my
area
which
results
in
a
great
deal
because
the
brew
itself
is
superb
buy
again
no
this
one
pours
very
dark
black
and
the
head
is
brown
and
made
up
of
big
bubbles
the
aroma
presents
some
notes
of
roasted
malts
but
nothing
else
on
the
taste
it
is
still
roasted
malts
and
the
bitterness
at
the
end
is
similar
to
an
espresso
coffee
creamy
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
good
stout
nothing
complex
but
it
delivers
to
bring
some
good
feelings
in
the
mouth
a
nice
one
to
have
and
could
be
very
sessionnable
d
bells
certain
has
no
problem
with
brewing
stouts
very
enjoyable
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
its
nice
to
see
the
basics
being
done
properly
easy
to
drink
especially
if
stouts
are
your
thing
if
you
are
a
porter
fan
but
dont
like
stouts
this
is
your
beer
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
great
job
to
larry
and
his
employees
another
reason
i
love
bells
drinkability
great
finish
but
then
again
kalamazoo
always
brings
a
smile
to
my
face
despite
the
somewhat
creepylooking
guy
on
its
label
this
beer
utterly
enjoyable
and
a
great
milk
stout
ill
surely
visit
kalamazoo
again
notes
i
loved
the
smell
of
this
one
and
the
taste
was
quite
inviting
the
only
thing
i
wasnt
terribly
fond
of
was
the
harsh
bitterness
i
detected
towards
the
end
that
made
it
somewhat
offputting
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
especially
considering
the
reasonable
price
conclusion
bells
has
some
great
beers
this
one
just
doesnt
come
together
for
me
i
cant
really
pinpoint
it
pours
a
thick
and
dark
brown
color
nice
plume
of
brown
head
leaving
little
lacing
behing
smell
is
of
charred
wood
earth
hints
of
bitter
coffee
and
cocoa
despite
the
aggressive
scents
the
taste
is
a
smooth
blend
of
the
char
smoke
earth
coffee
and
chocolate
note
hints
of
licorice
and
molasses
in
the
background
the
subduedness
is
almost
porter
like
but
and
interesting
finnishing
taste
is
present
almost
bolder
than
the
first
sip
medium
to
full
bodied
chewy
and
grainy
a
very
nice
unique
stout
d
excellent
american
stout
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
if
i
were
closer
to
home
michigan
and
this
were
more
readily
available
id
drink
this
more
often
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
american
stouts
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sit
down
with
friends
and
enjoy
with
friends
ive
had
some
really
good
stouts
but
this
is
by
far
going
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
d
really
nice
i
drank
the
whole
six
pack
d
easily
even
eminently
drinkable
hit
the
spot
wonderfully
after
a
long
day
at
work
while
this
is
a
decent
stout
there
are
many
better
ones
out
there
even
by
bells
such
as
their
java
stout
or
expedition
stout
d
a
very
good
stout
the
licorice
flavor
could
wear
on
you
after
a
while
but
it
holds
up
fairly
well
db
a
fairly
standard
six
pack
price
and
a
good
stout
flavor
with
a
nice
addition
of
licorice
it
is
nice
to
have
variations
on
a
pretty
beaten
down
style
and
licorice
certainly
does
the
job
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
lot
of
bells
when
i
was
in
pa
and
hope
to
go
back
and
try
some
more
soon
i
think
if
this
beer
werent
so
easy
to
get
it
would
be
rated
higher
scarcity
makes
demand
i
guess
these
are
the
days
of
limited
release
d
easy
going
almost
sessionable
beer
definitely
a
session
beer
in
flavor
just
not
alcohol
6
i
had
a
half
pint
of
this
the
night
it
was
tapped
the
head
had
awesome
retention
as
have
all
the
bells
casks
ive
tried
the
nose
nearly
matches
the
flavor
of
the
actual
liquid
being
light
and
playful
with
the
roasted
malts
that
are
typically
quite
heavy
needless
to
say
it
was
gone
way
before
i
was
ready
to
be
done
with
my
beer
kudos
to
bells
again
d
an
excellent
stout
definitely
worthy
of
being
a
staple
the
licorice
adds
a
nice
dimension
to
this
stout
that
is
definitely
welcome
not
too
sure
how
this
would
go
at
parties
unless
im
there
cause
id
drink
this
all
day
long
thumbs
up
its
nice
to
have
a
tasty
easy
drinking
stout
of
a
lower
abv
after
drinking
bcbcs
and
kbs
lately
would
definitely
buy
this
again
nice
session
beer
to
wash
down
a
burger
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
i
was
very
surprised
by
the
well
blended
flavors
in
this
one
if
you
like
stouts
then
this
is
a
definitely
must
try
worth
hunting
down
this
is
a
very
good
easy
drinking
brew
this
is
yet
another
sessionable
brew
from
bells
pours
a
thick
black
with
a
tiny
tan
head
smells
rich
and
wonderful
notes
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
with
a
hint
of
spices
taste
is
also
excellent
a
bitter
blend
of
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
licorace
not
very
sweet
at
all
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
bit
overcarbed
very
drinkable
despite
the
richness
of
this
beer
very
nice
drinkability
not
as
filling
as
the
nose
indicates
definitely
tastes
like
much
more
than
a
6
beer
d
i
would
have
another
for
sure
this
is
a
wellcrafted
beer
that
would
be
highly
sessionable
for
the
stout
lover
pretty
decent
price
tag
too
notes
plenty
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
flavorful
stout

needing
to
be

crazy

ever
experienced
in

beer

being
dense
i
could
not

more
than
12
of
this
beer

well
its
d

i
made
a

trips
back
to
the
cask
it
was
just
addictive
as

nice

on
this
beer
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
so
glad
i
did
an
exceptional
stout
incredibly
chewy
in
feel
complex
and
warm
this
stout
is
a
little
more
smoky
than
chocolate
or
coffee
but
not
an
overwhelming
smokiness
dark
fruits
also
come
through
a
little
thinner
than
some
stouts

it
really
works
for
this

interesting

harmonized
into

nice

ive
had

this

has
some
nice
individual
characteristics
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
with

is
good
ive
never
been
a
big
fan

it

quite
nice

has
a
traditional

maltiness
with
a
bit
of
a
bitter
kick
and
a
great
deal
of
molasses
in
the
finish
the
flavour
would
likely
have
been
a
4
5
if
the
mouthfeel
had
been
better
perhaps
it
was
the
aging
but
the
carbonation
was
too
low
and
it
didnt
have
any
real
carbonation
in
the
mouth
to
make
more
flavours
burst
out
it
was
so
antithetical
compared
to
the
large

that
was

bad
mouthfeel

to
the
lower

have

to

would

thanks
to
jdv
for
this
one
d
not
a
bad
stout
i
enjoyed
the
smell
much
more
than
the
taste
i
thought
the
bitterness
was
a
little
too
prevalent
in
the
taste
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
this
is
just
another
great
beer
from
a
fantastic
brewery
for
a
standard
stout
theres
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
and
variety
of
flavor
you
cant
go
wrong
with
bells
and
this
is
just
another
example
as
to
why
a
very
good
to
great
beer
that
is
certainly
worth
drinking

was

wasnt

of

to
it
it
had
a
heavy
taste
and
there
were
flavors
of
coffee
it
was
heavy
but
easy
to
drink
overall
it
was
a
very
good
stout
deffently
worth
picking
up
only
real
downside
is
its
a
little
pricy
overall
pretty
good
nothing
crazy
or
overpowering
really
reminds
me
of
a
sessional
porter
d
easy
didnt
expect
a
stout
with
this
flavor
to
be
so
smooth
and
chewy
at
the
same
time
but
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
in
one
sitting
d
were
the
taste
a
bit
stronger
this
would
be
a
really
good
brew
as
it
is
you
could
drink
this
singularly
all
evening
but
there
are
better
options
out
there

stout
aroma
was
a
mix
of
roasted

dark

taste
was
similar
to
the
aroma

with
a

more

the
roast

coffee
rather
than
cocoa
pretty
good
weight
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
had
well
carbonated
for
a
stout
and
has
a
silky
feel
it
has
a
soft
roasty

that
makes
it
very
drinkable

lacing
the
smell
was
anise
espresso
and
vanilla
with
a
slightly
smoky
undertone
coffee
and
sweet
vanilla
are
the
major
tastes
theres
also
a
smoky
nutty
thing
going
on
i
didnt
get
the
licorice
until
i
was
in
between
drinks
has
some
bite
in
the
feel
and
a
pretty
clean
finish
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
just
a
batch
number
almost
totally
black
in
color
with
about
an
inch
of
tan
head
roasted
grains
malts
and
nut
like
smells
dark
chocolate
flavors
some
minor
notes
of
dark
dried
fruit
thick
mouthfeel
almost
syrupy
very
tastey
stout
would
certainly
have
this
one
again
i
would
recommend
this
stout
to
anyone
who
wants
to
try
a
stout
but
isnt
quite
sure
a
beginner
stout
if
you
will
notes
to
experience
euphoria
pair
with
fresh
chocolate
chip
cookie
overall
the
dark
fruits
in
the
nose
bothered
me
a
bit
with
each
sip
but
luckily
the
taste
of
the
beer
made
up
for
it
in
a
way
im
glad
ive
passed
over
this
one
and
i
will
probably
continue
to
do
that
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
for
the
price
but
by
no
means
is
it
bad
d
velvety
and
smooth
easy
drinking
but
just
not
my
style
of
stout
i
like
em
big
and
real
thick
d
quite
full
bodied
for
a
beer
that
is
this
low
abv
bells
really
knows
their
stouts
and
it
shows
here
a
bit
carbonated
for
its
style
but
it
works
for
me
here
nose
and
flavors
are
complex
and
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
go
for
this
one
again
d
not
too
bad
for
a
heavy
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
had
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
succession
around
a
campfire
would
be
quite
satisfying
that
molasses
follows
through
on
the
palate
with
a
swift
kick
of
vanilla
and
as
i
leisurely
took
my
final
sips
i
got
an
aroma
and
flavor
of
chocolate
mousse
like
the
final
bite
of
a
delicious
dessert
great
job
bells
overall
a
solid
stout
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
stout
d
overall
not
that
complex
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
bells
ive
had
many
of
your
beers
now
and
i
have
to
say
kalamazoo
is
one
to
be
remembered
would
love
to
have
a
chance
to
try
their
cream
stout
expedition
stout
and
this
tasty
brew
sidebyside
i
know
that
would
make
for
one
hell
of
a
night
this
is
a
stout
you
could
pour
into
a
snifter
and
sip
as
a
winter
warmer
when
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
a
high
alcohol
bomber
this
is
a
good
stout
but
its
powerful
astringent
dryness
limits
its
appeal
for
me
serving
type
bottle
next
review
this
is
one
beastly
stout
gorgeous
black
color
in
the
glass
with
dark
brown
head
that
almost
overflowed
my
glass
head
retention
is
good
with
nice
lace
nose
has
some
pleasant
freshly
ground
coffee
aromas
and
a
trace
of
fruit
in
the
distant
background
big
dessert
flavors
are
noted
on
the
palate
perhaps
like
one
of
those
double
chocolate
chip
cookies
hops
balance
out
nicely
and
finish
is
long
with
a
lot
of
roasty
flavors
wrote
this
from
my
phone
hopefully
not
a
ton
of
tpyos
smooth
mouthfeel
followed
by
a
long
bitter
finish
easy
drinking
pours
jet
black
in
color
with
a
boisterous
brown
head
that
leaves
a
decent
lacing
behind
aroma
consists
of
bubblegum
licorice
with
hints
of
toffee
coffee
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
bitterness
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
up
front
with
sweetness
of
black
licorice
in
the
finish
a
bit
watery
finish
as
well
though
dark
almost
opaque
color
with
a
thin
tawny
head
aromas
of
burnt
coffee
and
faint
hints
of
chocolate
some
fruity
and
hoppy
notes
as
well
in
the
nose
medium
bodied
and
smooth
the
taste
is
consistent
with
the
aromas
nice
coffee
bitterness
chocolate
and
caramel
and
toffee
even
a
little
vanilla
bean
very
easy
drinking
stout
not
at
all
heavy
makes
you
want
more
than
one
a
very
very
competent
offering
by
a
premier
brewery
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
this
one
has
a
lower
alcohol
content
and
manages
to
be
crisp
and
clean
very
flavorful
and
fun
to
enjoy
licorice
and
chocolate
in
the
aroma
my
friend
picked
up
some
definite
soy
sauce
notes
also
taste
is
roasty
malt
and
licorice
up
front
clean
finish
with
some
lingering
coffee
notes
medium
body
clean
finish
unusally
high
drinkability
for
a
stout
while
maintaining
big
tasted
another
winner
by
bells
d
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
not
great
either
the
burnt
and
somewhat
bitter
flavor
makes
it
hard
to
drink
quickly
the
slowestdrinking
low
abv
american
stout
ive
experienced
i
normally
dont
mind
bitterness
in
a
stout
but
theres
nothing
really
balancing
this
out
essentially
an
average
looking
stout
thats
enjoyable
in
every
way
but
wasnt
quite
as
exceptional
as
i
hoped
md
possibly
a
little
on
the
thin
side
here
a
nice
subtle
carbonation
fits
in
quite
well
the
mouthfeel
brings
out
some
of
the
coffee
characters
so
it
does
work
for
this
beer
but
i
could
use
a
little
more
viscosity
its
quite
easy
drinking
for
a
stout
no
extreme
flavors
slowing
you
down
d
this
beer
is
so
complex
it
makes
many
an
ris
seem
simple
no
element
of
this
beer
is
even
slightly
offensive
to
the
senses
this
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
in
all
a
very
tasty
stout
that
doesnt
sacrifice
flavor
for
drinkability
i
like
this
a
lot
and
will
probably
purchase
again
this
one
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
but
with
not
much
head
i
dumped
it
pretty
hard
towards
the
end
and
got
maybe
18
smells
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
tastes
the
same
with
some
licorice
thrown
in
a
nice
blend
of
flavor
but
not
very
intense
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
and
this
one
is
almost
bordering
on
a
porter
aside
from
appearance
drinkability
very
good
and
not
too
bad
in
terms
of
alcohol
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
after
a
while
i
think
i
would
get
sick
of
how
ridiculously
strong
and
coffeelike
this
is
d
an
overall
satisfying
taste
and
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
medium
body
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
wish
i
bought
more
than
one
drinkability
excellent
especially
considering
this
is
a
stout
not
a
session
beer
but
id
drink
two
pours
a
licorice
black
color
with
a
1
head
like
all
bells
brews
have
it
had
a
black
cherry
ring
with
some
nice
lacingsmell
was
chocolatemolasses
fig
and
plum
the
taste
was
a
bittersweet
chocolate
with
an
over
roasted
coffee
taste
followed
by
some
currant
fruits
and
malts
overall
a
good
stout
allthough
a
little
to
bitter
and
not
well
balanced
not
my
favorite
but
worthy
bells
is
no
longer
a
go
to
brew
for
all
styles
4
me
their
quality
in
small
batch
brewery
charm
has
taken
a
hit
in
their
hopes
to
expand
to
quickly
to
many
areas
to
fast
and
in
turn
has
hurt
them
imo
slight
hop
bitterness
in
front
fades
into
a
roasted
coffee
rich
flavor
with
anise
showing
up
to
on
the
back
end
the
mouth
feel
of
this
is
great
really
full
and
creamy
without
being
to
cloying
the
aftertaste
shows
mostly
the
roast
flavor
and
just
a
bit
of
the
hops
as
well
giving
this
beer
a
spicy
kind
of
aspect
to
it
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
stout
and
at
10
99
a
sixer
and
only
6
im
only
a
little
bummed
this
is
one
of
hell
of
beer
my
first
offering
from
bells
and
im
impressed
a
wonderful
american
stout
this
convinced
me
to
pick
up
a
case
this
time
around
i
wasnt
as
impressed
still
good
just
not
as
good
as
the
first
only
thing
to
compare
that
may
be
the
reason
it
was
better
ice
cold
the
colder
the
better
the
second
time
i
had
it
there
was
more
of
a
bitterness
to
the
licorice
than
recalled
overall
though
definately
a
worthy
stout
enjoy
it
md
medium
bodied
and
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
the
plain
old
american
stout
is
often
neglected
but
this
is
an
excellent
one
great
roasted
flavor
and
char
taste
in
this
stout
thinner
mouth
feel
than
expected
from
an
american
stout
but
i
like
it
makes
for
about
as
sessional
yet
decent
a
stout
as
you
are
going
to
find
the
stout
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
tan
bubbly
head
that
is
about
2
fingers
thick
not
much
lacing
lines
the
glass
ah
how
i
love
the
smell
of
a
good
stout
big
malty
smell
hits
you
up
front
with
a
sweet
nutty
finish
taste
is
a
little
different
than
i
am
guessing
it
is
the
licorice
that
is
giving
the
strange
sweet
quaff
but
i
cant
quite
pinpoint
what
is
going
on
with
this
thing
very
good
tasting
none
the
less
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
drinkability
is
of
course
high
i
dont
think
there
is
a
bells
brew
that
i
couldnt
handle
a
whole
nights
worth
of
drinking
overall
a
great
american
stout
from
the
brewers
at
bells
mfd
im
a
bit
divided
on
whether
or
not
to
give
the
body
a
4
or
4
5
i
think
it
is
a
bit
too
light
but
the
carbonation
does
a
great
job
of
thickening
out
the
overall
feeling
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
but
the
carbonation
is
quite
full
either
way
the
drinkability
is
extraordinary
as
the
beer
is
incredibly
delicious
d
all
around
a
very
respectable
stout
i
wouldnt
refuse
another
but
i
can
think
of
some
other
beers
id
rather
have
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
provides
a
hint
of
coffee
and
the
flavor
is
reminiscent
of
black
coffee
with
a
bit
of
fruity
malt
sweetness
to
balance
heavily
roasted
malts
are
one
thing
but
the
flavor
of
this
one
makes
me
think
they
went
one
step
further
and
burnt
some
of
the
malt
again
however
the
malt
sweetness
brings
some
balance
to
this
dark
bitterness
this
combination
provides
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
without
giving
up
the
distinctive
flavor
profile
that
makes
this
stout
as
easydrinking
as
many
of
the
yearround
offerings
from
bells
jet
black
with
a
light
brown
head
and
deep
dark
mahogany
highlights
against
the
light
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
on
the
nose
the
roasted
flavors
are
awesome
strong
but
nicely
integrated
great
balance
between
the
roasted
coffee
bitterness
and
the
devils
food
cake
fudgechocolate
flavors
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
i
think
ive
ever
had
damn
fine
stout
drinkabilitycould
easily
sit
down
and
drink
a
few
of
these
anytime
really
enjoyed
the
brew
a
greatly
balanced
unique
stout
in
my
opinion
obsidian
color
with
tree
bark
colored
head
abundant
aromas
dark
bakers
chocolate
everywhere
something
alot
like
raisinettes
too
mildly
roasted
a
bit
milky
flavor
licorice
is
hardly
noticeable
some
minerality
in
there
too
very
rich
mouthfeel
is
very
chewy
a
moderate
abv
makes
it
much
easier
to
order
a
second
d
its
easily
drinkable
i
would
like
to
see
how
it
fares
on
tap
other
than
that
i
am
in
no
hurry
to
drink
it
again
there
are
several
other
stouts
i
would
turn
to
before
this
several
other
bells
offerings
too
d
this
is
one
sessionable
stout
i
love
black
licorice
so
this
was
a
real
treat
for
me
definitely
will
always
have
a
spot
for
one
in
the
fridge
i
went
to
this
brewery
back
during
the
time
i
lived
in
michigan
it
was
called
the
kalamazoo
brewery
then
and
not
bells
i
think
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
not
really
sure
i
got
the
bottle
and
poured
it
straight
down
the
middle
of
the
room
temperature
glass
and
beheld
a
glass
full
of
black
liquid
with
a
tan
head
about
12
fingers
tall
the
aroma
was
very
smokey
with
hints
of
chocolate
tasting
it
revealed
nothing
more
still
a
lot
of
smokeyness
and
some
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
coffee
the
mouthfee
was
a
little
heavy
but
not
too
much
considering
you
couldnt
even
see
through
the
glass
holding
it
up
to
a
light
im
not
big
on
stouts
or
licorice
but
this
is
very
good
from
tasting
notes
dated
23
aug
2009
overall
a
nice
variation
on
the
magic
of
bells
a
stout
recipe
drinkability
fairly
easy
to
drink
d
a
good
stout
with
very
potent
roasted
components
great
for
a
fallwinter
night
beside
the
fireplace
or
for
an
early
morning
pickmeup
rather
simple
and
straightforward
but
rewarding
nonetheless
this
was
a
nice
medium
stout
the
strong
coffee
taste
made
it
very
drinkable
for
me
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
reduces
to
a
collar
aroma
was
light
coffee
the
taste
surprised
me
imo
bells
forte
is
the
ipa
types
and
their
dark
beers
are
not
up
to
that
level
however
the
kalamazoo
stout
is
an
exception
very
nice
flavor
of
coffee
and
a
little
licorice
far
better
than
their
porter
or
that
horrible
expedition
stout
absurdly
strong
coffee
taste
the
mouth
feel
was
a
little
light
for
a
stout
not
bad
drinkability
was
quite
reasonable
for
a
stout
the
6
0
abv
helps
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
and
at
only
6
abv
im
sure
i
could
easily
consume
a
sixer
to
myself
on
a
cold
winters
night
yummy
this
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
opaque
black
with
a
thin
dark
brown
head
to
it
that
recedes
very
quickly
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
of
strong
coffee
with
toasted
and
roasted
malts
in
the
background
taste
starts
with
some
burnt
malts
moving
in
to
toasted
malts
in
the
middle
finishes
with
a
strong
bitter
coffee
finish
there
is
a
bit
of
cream
that
mingles
in
this
beer
to
give
a
touch
of
sweetness
medium
body
low
carbonation
creamy
feel
to
this
beer
this
is
by
and
far
one
of
the
best
stouts
that
i
have
had
recently
and
is
one
to
sit
with
for
a
long
time
mouthfeel
was
rich
and
silky
moderate
fine
carbonation
i
really
cant
put
my
finger
on
what
i
think
about
this
beer
stouts
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
the
taste
is
interesting
even
on
a
stout
kick
this
wouldnt
be
the
first
one
id
reach
for
dnice
stout
i
would
love
to
drink
again
i
am
going
to
pair
this
with
a
cuavana
intenso
cigar
and
i
am
betting
it
will
be
a
nice
pairing
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
but
it
has
a
surprising
carbonation
bite
there
is
even
a
slight
acidity
that
i
wasnt
expecting
drinkability
is
high
i
could
and
will
slam
these
back
all
night
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
my
go
to
stouts
reasonably
priced
too
the
texture
and
feel
of
this
beer
is
perfect
full
bodied
rich
and
thick
much
moreso
than
id
expect
from
a
6
stout
this
beer
is
an
absolute
joy
to
drink
d
nice
example
of
the
style
but
i
prefer
heavier
stouts
notes
i
feel
as
if
this
stout
is
one
that
is
perfect
for
someone
looking
to
start
drinking
this
style
notes
this
is
a
big
beer
with
lots
of
dark
fruit
this
is
an
imperial
stout
in
flavor
without
the
abv
my
bottle
of
kalamazoo
stout
poured
a
deep
opaque
black
as
if
from
stygian
depths
its
thin
light
brown
head
slowly
disappeared
decorating
my
glass
with
a
pretty
lacing
a
light
chocolatey
smell
roasted
almost
charred
coffee
flavor
no
bitterness
or
aftertaste
immensely
smooth
and
drinkable
thick
and
hearty
mouthfeel
much
more
drinkable
than
old
rasputin
although
it
lacks
the
latters
complex
array
of
flavors
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
a
little
burnt
tasting
but
still
excellent
and
the
6
percent
abv
makes
it
sessionable
pours
nearly
black
with
a
thin
beige
head
and
nice
lacing
coffee
aroma
and
a
little
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
complex
with
some
coffee
malt
chocolate
and
a
mildly
smoky
finish
mediumheavy
mouth
feel
is
satisfying
not
too
sweet
nor
bitter
good
balance
overall
quite
good
and
will
probably
be
a
regular
for
me
overall
a
nice
and
tasty
treat
but
overall
not
quite
a
smash
hit
lots
of
bold
flavors
which
were
both
enjoyable
and
almost
overwhelming
it
might
be
tough
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
but
that
one
would
be
a
real
treat
good
beer
a
must
try
for
lovers
of
the
style
drinkability
excellent
beer
but
a
little
filling
for
my
taste
however
i
could
certainly
get
this
again
the
body
lets
this
one
down
its
just
too
light
a
little
more
bulk
to
this
one
a
little
more
roast
and
it
could
be
a
worldbeater
as
it
is
nice
but
nothing
spectacular
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
still
a
pretty
damn
good
stout
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
light
head
tan
in
color
was
no
lace
but
the
head
and
color
was
great
smells
a
strong
strong
coffee
and
chocolate
with
roasted
malt
and
hops
a
very
creamy
feel
with
a
full
body
and
smooth
carbonation
tastes
mostly
of
coffee
and
chocolate
d
i
usually
do
not
like
licorice
but
the
addition
of
this
to
the
stout
actually
was
welcome
here
and
produced
a
good
beer
d
great
stout
and
pairs
fantastically
with
my
cheesecake
for
dessert
tasty
beer
good
flavor
of
roasted
grains
not
overly
bitter
at
any
point
slightly
burnt
chocolate
taste
with
even
a
slightly
sweet
finish
not
a
lot
of
overwhelming
hop
character
to
this
beer
but
balanced
well
i
dont
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
my
hands
on
more
but
it
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
more
than
one
of
drinks
very
smoothly
the
sweetcream
flavor
makes
it
a
great
drinker
tastes
like
old
musty
cigar
smoke
this
is
slightly
below
average
for
the
style
maybe
some
sweetness
for
balance
or
some
other
dimensions
another
great
one
from
bells
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
night
darkest
brown
almost
black
with
a
dark
chestnut
head
of
dense
foam
that
leaves
thick
creamy
lace
behind
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
coffee
fudge
and
anise
the
flavor
is
nice
and
roasty
with
much
of
the
same
flavors
as
the
nose
but
with
an
assertive
charred
bitterness
that
balances
the
flavors
nicely
nice
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
smooth
and
slightly
viscous
a
great
stout
well
its
no
expedition
but
its
still
pretty
tasty
this
would
actually
make
a
fairly
decent
session
stout
to
be
honest
i
wasnt
expecting
a
great
deal
from
this
beer
but
it
pleasantly
surprised
me
its
a
darn
good
stout
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
kalamazoo
stouts
another
fine
beer
from
bells
its
a
very
very
good
milk
stout
easily
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
personally
i
think
the
coffee
flavors
a
little
too
intense
for
the
style
but
it
still
produces
a
really
fine
tasting
beer
i
like
coffee
a
lot
so
that
doesnt
offend
me
it
might
be
a
little
better
if
that
aspect
were
more
restrained
and
allowed
more
of
the
other
flavors
to
shine
a
little
slight
complaint
but
there
it
is
a
little
more
body
would
add
a
smoother
feel
as
well
who
am
i
kidding
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
and
worth
seeking
out
go
find
a
few
pours
out
a
dark
pretty
much
black
color
with
like
a
cm
brown
head
kind
of
thick
and
dense
leaves
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
it
sort
of
fades
but
does
have
pretty
decent
retention
there
is
an
incredibly
roast
barley
smell
tiny
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
roast
character
is
very
nice
much
greater
than
the
average
sweet
stout
not
a
huge
amount
of
sweetness
but
there
is
kind
of
a
creamy
smell
with
a
bit
of
a
lactic
twang
very
nice
the
taste
is
very
nice
too
a
bit
burnt
but
overall
exactly
what
it
should
be
theres
a
dark
roasty
center
to
it
like
some
kind
of
a
combination
of
dark
bitter
chocolate
or
coffee
but
really
it
cant
be
anything
other
than
the
roast
barley
and
black
malt
a
tiny
bit
of
sourness
some
decent
sweetness
with
a
tiny
bit
of
estery
oily
taste
but
not
overopowering
a
nice
bit
of
sweetness
balances
it
out
and
fills
out
the
body
leaving
it
nice
and
creamy
pretty
full
and
pelasant
id
say
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
one
of
my
favorites
to
date
particularly
because
of
the
extra
roasty
character
a
nice
straightforward
stout
a
good
beer
for
any
occasion
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
deep
opaque
sable
with
a
thick
beige
head
aroma
is
strong
and
oily
mainly
of
burnt
coffee
mouthfilling
flavor
is
strongly
smoky
with
a
coffee
undertone
and
hints
of
molasses
there
is
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
texture
is
thick
and
smooth
with
a
tingly
edge
and
it
leaves
a
coffeeish
aftertaste
drinkability
is
high
based
on
the
flavor
and
the
relatively
low
abv
a
classic
and
it
seems
to
keep
well
it
trades
off
a
little
body
for
drinkability
but
thats
just
nitpicking
its
obviously
a
great
beer
mouthfeel
drinkability
creamy
and
fullbodied
borders
on
chewy
this
is
a
rather
robust
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
what
i
would
expect
from
a
milk
stout
very
nice
another
solid
stout
from
bells
while
the
kalamazoo
stout
is
definitely
more
complex
in
its
tastes
than
other
similarly
situated
stouts
while
i
realize
its
no
longer
in
the
same
stylistic
category
i
think
youngs
double
chocolate
is
fairly
comparable
with
its
roasted
coffeemilk
chocolate
flavor
profile
it
doesnt
have
that
same
mouthfeel
and
overall
experience
for
me
nonetheless
i
would
heartily
recommend
the
kalamazoo
stout
to
any
stout
fans
and
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
beer
again
drinkability
one
of
the
top
two
in
the
style
i
have
tried
so
far
definately
worthy
of
my
200th
review
on
this
site
a
great
beer
by
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
you
barely
notice
the
high
abv
really
tasty
stout
d
id
love
another
this
is
an
excellent
representative
of
the
sweet
stout
style
tasty
but
very
filling
great
dessert
beer
all
in
all
a
very
nice
albeit
sweeter
stout
from
bells
everything
melds
quite
well
and
its
construction
is
nearly
flawless
this
is
not
one
i
would
seek
out
all
the
time
but
as
the
occasional
session
stout
hell
im
game
d
very
drinkable
for
such
a
serious
beer
could
drink
34
but
wouldnt
out
of
respect
finishes
very
well
smooth
and
mealy
with
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
drinkability
a
nice
drinkable
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
d
fairly
drinkable
a
lessintense
stout
experience
not
sure
if
this
is
an
english
sweet
stout
or
an
american
stout
doesnt
matter
as
either
way
this
is
the
best
nonimperial
stout
i
have
ever
had
this
isnt
really
exceptional
but
it
is
a
solid
lighter
stout
that
is
pretty
sessionable
drinkability
i
turn
to
milk
stouts
as
a
snack
something
to
enjoy
after
dinner
and
could
get
around
to
two
or
three
in
a
row
if
im
in
the
mood
this
beer
is
pleasant
great
drinkability
sipper
and
savor
or
session
if
you
can
i
would
recommend
this
for
the
man
looking
to
get
his
woman
a
stout
or
a
man
looking
to
enjoy
a
few
on
a
cool
night
love
this
beer
overall
these
days
its
getting
hard
to
find
good
stouts
with
bold
flavors
that
come
in
at
a
relatively
low
abv
to
my
tastes
at
least
this
is
one
is
pretty
good
but
i
wouldnt
put
it
up
with
the
likes
of
obsidian
for
example
it
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
and
overcarbonated
the
aroma
is
terrific
but
the
body
and
taste
dont
live
up
to
that
promise
d
this
is
a
fairly
easy
drinker
for
a
stout
i
dont
quite
buy
into
the
taste
but
it
goes
down
easy
anyway
d
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
that
had
a
deep
roasted
flavor
overall
this
is
a
solid
stout
with
bold
flavor
that
hinges
on
being
sessionable
highly
recommend
buy
this
beer
if
you
want
something
good
to
drink
nothing
else
needs
to
be
said
pours
black
with
a
huge
rocky
tan
head
that
holds
great
ret
leaves
an
explosion
of
lacing
aromas
are
chocolate
roasty
espresso
creamy
rich
dark
bitter
bakers
chocolate
roasted
barley
french
roast
coffee
ashy
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
creamy
full
body
overall
great
to
go
back
to
this
and
reaffirm
its
awesomeness
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
i
prefer
it
to
the
taste
because
i
dont
get
that
kinda
nasty
licorice
aftertaste
when
i
let
the
beverage
simply
rest
in
my
mouth
im
obviously
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
but
i
respect
bells
and
enjoy
stouts
enough
to
appreciate
the
character
this
beer
offers
to
a
true
beer
advocate
d
very
good
stout
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
a
while
would
be
perfect
as
an
evening
beer
highly
recommended
would
drink
again
mouthfeel
is
smooth
mediumfull
body
with
a
higher
than
expected
level
of
carbonation
notes
had
this
about
a
week
ago
just
taking
me
time
to
post
the
review
though
its
been
saved
on
my
computer
bells
are
not
available
in
my
area
but
i
got
this
from
a
friend
that
made
a
beer
run
in
ohio
i
wish
i
could
get
it
more
often
without
a
two
hour
drive
involved
want
to
give
props
on
how
thick
this
beer
is
something
a
lot
of
so
called
stouts
lack
very
drinkable
beer
its
so
drinkable
in
fact
that
this
glass
of
it
may
be
going
down
slightly
too
fast
over
all
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
its
everything
i
look
for
in
an
american
stout
strong
but
not
to
hoppy
and
a
great
lasting
finish
i
highly
recommend
it
d
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
stouts
are
my
favorite
style
and
this
beer
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
do
enjoy
a
lot
of
bigger
stouts
but
this
one
stands
out
among
others
bells
brews
two
of
my
favorite
stouts
between
this
and
expedition
d
very
good
another
quality
offering
from
bells
overall
this
is
another
great
beer
from
bells
it
is
quite
drinkable
because
the
flavor
does
not
thrash
the
palate
and
the
abv
does
not
send
you
to
the
moon
if
you
havent
had
it
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
and
likely
enjoying
d
this
is
a
top
level
stout
not
the
best
by
any
means
but
its
right
up
there
in
the
big
leagues
dig
the
licorice
ive
always
been
a
big
fan
of
black
licorice
drinkability
another
solid
beer
form
bells
not
as
sweet
as
some
milksweet
stouts
but
maybe
a
little
more
complex
poured
a
thick
almost
pitchblack
body
with
brisk
carbonation
that
led
to
a
twofinger
tan
head
that
died
at
a
medium
pace
and
left
some
spider
lacing
a
pleasant
thick
malt
smell
of
roasted
maybe
toasted
maltsoats
something
akin
to
bread
and
coffee
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
caramel
a
mediumtofull
bodied
beer
that
mixes
being
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
burnt
dryness
goes
down
smooth
almost
slick
at
times
and
has
the
drying
sensation
that
a
quality
stout
possesses
taste
is
comprised
of
bread
malt
some
roastedtoasted
and
coffee
malt
notes
possible
toffee
some
chocolate
and
caramel
maybe
molasses
there
seems
to
be
hints
of
heavy
fruits
in
there
my
pallete
is
all
over
the
place
trying
to
pick
up
the
bits
and
pieces
of
everything
in
there
even
has
a
slight
alkie
kick
on
the
backend
to
boost
it
up
and
some
spices
a
mildly
warming
complex
sipper
that
is
great
to
relax
w
anytime
especially
as
a
nightcap
d
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
carbonated
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
think
i
enjoyed
it
better
fresh
overall
bells
brewery
continues
to
amaze
me
ive
yet
to
drink
one
of
their
beers
that
isnt
extremely
inspired
and
worthy
of
my
hard
earned
cash
the
kalamazoo
stout
along
with
the
heavier
expedition
stout
is
a
very
solid
stout
where
the
expedition
stout
is
meant
to
be
more
of
a
sipper
the
kalamazoo
is
something
that
can
be
enjoyed
at
a
bit
quicker
pace
with
such
a
low
abv
this
is
one
that
can
be
ready
to
go
with
only
about
30
minutes
in
the
fridge
drinkability
for
a
stout
this
is
one
i
couldnt
have
more
than
a
couple
of
strongly
flavored
but
pretty
smooth
more
tangy
than
sweet
tons
of
roast
chocolate
and
coffee
probably
the
most
ive
tasted
in
a
nonris
stout
smokiness
that
reminds
me
of
a
rauchbier
but
only
vaguely
slightly
bitter
and
very
roasty
aftertaste
smooth
but
the
carbonation
is
almost
sharp
and
when
combined
with
the
strong
flavors
almost
makes
the
beer
a
little
harsh
nevertheless
this
is
an
incredibly
flavorful
stout
and
youd
think
it
would
be
heavier
based
on
that
absolutely
delicious
and
very
drinkable
at
around
6
abv
not
too
dry
but
im
sure
it
would
be
a
bit
tart
for
some
but
for
a
stout
it
is
what
it
is
and
should
be
very
drinkable
as
well
its
like
guinness
but
a
bit
more
refined
a
very
pleasant
stout
would
be
a
great
stout
with
seafood
d
not
the
most
exciting
version
of
this
style
and
something
i
wont
buy
again
i
guess
i
expected
more
from
bells
this
beer
pours
out
very
dark
taste
a
lot
like
an
imperial
stout
smells
like
dark
chocolate
exceptional
mouthfeel
calm
and
yet
so
smooth
robust
flavor
that
doesnt
overwhelm
your
taste
buds
yet
rich
in
flavor
very
nice
aftertaste
as
well
not
an
overly
impressive
head
but
creamy
in
color
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
d
oh
how
i
wish
we
had
this
in
texas
smooth
thick
delicious
flavor
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
usually
catagorize
a
sweet
stout
as
more
like
a
heavy
stout
but
with
a
smoother
finish
to
the
roasted
malts
highly
recommended
a
very
tasty
sweet
stout
thanks
to
imstillthegman
for
the
opportunity
drinkability
good
not
sure
that
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
thin
dark
brown
head
which
settles
around
the
glass
edges
quickly
vacating
the
center
lacing
not
as
pronounced
as
you
might
expect
really
truly
cannot
get
any
blacker
than
this
not
even
a
hint
of
color
sweet
nose
of
grapes
rum
cake
licorice
duh
coffee
rinds
wood
smoke
dark
chocolate
powder
more
creamy
in
texture
than
scents
granola
and
cereal
as
it
warms
a
little
more
mixed
black
fruit
comes
out
fullbodied
dense
attack
requires
you
focus
on
the
act
of
swallowing
more
roast
and
toast
here
charred
black
coffee
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
and
fried
butter
this
tends
to
rise
up
and
plaster
your
mouth
roof
while
the
tongue
undergoes
a
noticeable
release
of
pressure
the
carbonation
does
what
it
can
given
the
compactness
of
the
whole
same
interplay
between
green
grapeapple
acidity
and
darker
fruits
no
citrus
nor
flowers
licorice
lower
here
murmur
suggestion
of
mineral
water
opens
a
space
for
grainy
notes
nothing
leaps
out
at
you
perhaps
too
tightly
coiled
to
strike
fully
tires
the
palate
out
before
the
first
glass
done
d
i
dont
think
it
was
designed
as
a
session
beer
but
it
is
highly
drinkable
for
a
sweet
stout
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
full
with
some
carbonation
the
finish
is
medium
to
full
and
last
for
a
few
moments
on
the
palate
this
is
a
great
full
flavored
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
wonderful
characteristic
in
this
stout
it
is
not
overtly
sweet
but
well
balance
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
very
nice
brew
drinkable
most
definitely
i
could
go
through
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
an
excellent
stout
really
struck
me
more
of
a
strong
stout
than
a
sweet
stout
more
roasty
and
bitter
notes
than
creamy
sweetness
which
is
alright
its
still
delicious
just
not
as
expected
definitely
worth
the
time
to
give
it
a
shot
this
is
a
very
good
very
drinkable
stout
and
a
full
notch
better
than
the
double
cream
stout
im
not
sure
what
the
differences
are
in
the
recipes
but
it
doesnt
seem
quite
as
simple
as
start
with
kalamazoo
and
add
more
cream
which
is
too
bad
because
that
would
make
the
double
cream
stout
a
better
beer
this
is
a
very
good
one
great
stuff
that
id
be
glad
to
have
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
very
dark
with
a
dense
tan
head
that
subsided
quickly
smelled
of
bitter
coffee
and
slightly
burnt
toast
surprisingly
thin
on
the
tongue
and
very
carbonated
for
a
stout
flavors
of
espresso
and
molasses
strike
first
with
a
lasting
feel
of
burnt
caramel
and
overboiled
coffee
but
in
a
good
way
expected
this
to
be
an
intense
and
robust
stout
but
was
surprised
to
find
it
thinner
and
softer
than
i
thought
well
balanced
but
lacking
some
of
the
backing
sweetness
of
a
milk
stout
and
somewhat
dominated
by
the
carbonation
the
flavors
blend
well
and
offer
a
pleasing
experience
overall
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
straight
up
stouts
its
just
as
flavorful
as
a
lot
of
riss
without
all
the
alcohol
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
wonderful
oil
black
color
with
a
thick
chocolate
milk
head
the
head
is
short
lived
but
leaves
a
nice
cap
on
the
brew
with
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
solid
with
strong
tones
of
coffee
chocolate
roasted
malts
but
the
burnt
smell
is
a
little
overpowering
the
taste
is
great
the
chocolate
rolls
on
your
tongue
and
leads
to
a
balanced
coffee
finish
this
is
a
full
bodied
brew
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
that
makes
the
taste
pop
in
your
mouth
extremely
well
put
together
brew
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
very
dark
malt
molasses
and
bitter
chocolate
in
the
taste
seems
to
be
a
bit
reserved
the
younger
brother
of
the
expedition
a
little
thin
but
smooth
in
taste
decent
beer
but
there
is
not
much
that
can
hang
with
the
expo
ill
stick
with
it
d
great
taste
combined
with
reasonable
abv
would
make
this
a
decent
session
beer
it
would
be
a
great
one
but
theres
a
little
too
much
sweetness
for
this
to
be
a
classic
getting
drunk
with
the
boys
on
saturday
night
beer
poured
into
my
pint
glass
very
dark
coffee
colored
with
a
substantially
sized
creamy
off
white
head
smells
of
coffee
toffee
and
malt
very
roasted
tastes
like
roasted
malts
with
a
very
slight
sweetness
exceptionally
smooth
and
well
blended
easy
on
the
palate
the
archetype
of
the
style
this
is
the
anchor
porter
the
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
the
best
representation
of
the
style
that
being
said
ill
always
be
on
the
lookout
for
one
thats
better
and
rest
assured
it
will
happen
even
jordan
retired
and
brewers
will
always
get
better
but
now
this
is
the
top
dog
cheers
d
this
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
it
was
nice
to
sit
back
at
sip
on
md
a
nice
light
bodied
stout
that
has
a
very
smooth
nice
taste
and
is
easy
drinking
pours
a
dark
black
14
inch
head
with
slight
retention
and
lsight
lacing
smells
of
a
dark
rich
malt
and
sweetness
fits
the
style
of
a
milksweet
stout
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
slighty
thick
theres
a
high
carbonation
level
and
an
associated
bitterness
tastes
very
rich
of
a
strong
malt
some
roasted
malt
as
well
and
theres
a
slight
hop
bitterness
overall
a
very
good
rich
stout
definitely
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
overall
i
liked
this
as
a
good
stout
to
have
on
hand
when
a
nice
food
beer
is
needed
kalamazoo
stout
pours
jet
black
iwth
a
big
fluffy
brown
head
with
good
retention
smells
are
good
but
nothing
extraordinary
all
of
the
dark
chocolate
and
roastiness
expected
of
a
craft
stout
sipping
wow
before
i
even
say
a
word
about
the
taste
let
me
just
say
that
the
body
of
this
beer
hits
me
just
right
its
substantial
fullness
is
is
keenly
felt
initially
before
the
carbonation
lightens
it
up
and
lets
the
numerous
flavors
come
out
to
express
themselves
the
roasty
and
dark
chocolate
bittersweetness
come
through
clearly
but
dont
shock
the
senses
rather
they
are
quite
well
balanced
the
finish
is
a
long
and
gratifying
tugofwar
between
the
burnt
malts
and
smoky
bitterness
that
i
find
endlessly
gratifying
a
very
nice
stout
that
i
intend
to
have
year
after
year
completing
my
bells
beer
slam
of
tonight
with
this
stout
brewed
with
brewers
licorice
smell
is
chocolate
both
milk
and
semisweet
and
cinnamon
some
coffee
cookies
and
cream
ice
cream
wow
pours
to
a
jet
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
taste
is
roasted
malts
sugars
chocolate
milk
and
some
coffee
hints
only
slightly
bitter
at
the
end
but
overall
sweet
this
style
is
really
starting
to
grow
on
me
and
this
brew
is
definitely
in
the
upper
echelons
of
this
style
complex
and
delicious
a
typical
offering
of
bells
in
that
it
has
a
spectrum
of
flavors
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
smooth
a
little
sweet
to
be
a
sessioner
but
these
would
be
great
rotated
in
with
a
hoppy
brew
d
easy
to
drink
could
knock
out
a
few
of
these
d
average
a
pretty
good
brew
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
dvery
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
and
unusual
complexity
enjoyable
for
sure
i
must
say
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
had
it
at
the
melting
pot
in
minneapolis
there
isnt
much
of
a
head
but
a
nice
deep
black
color
smell
and
taste
are
very
similar
nice
chocolate
nose
and
taste
a
bit
of
dry
malt
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
weak
for
the
way
that
i
like
my
stouts
drinkability
is
great
for
the
style
d
very
good
stout
that
you
can
have
a
few
of
due
to
the
moderate
abv
pours
a
deep
black
that
i
cant
see
tyhrough
a
creamy
brown
modest
head
sits
on
top
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
aroma
is
earthy
chocolaty
grainy
with
a
hint
of
licorice
and
milk
the
flavor
begins
with
sweet
dark
malt
and
fruit
but
is
quickly
cut
by
an
acrid
slightly
smokey
and
roasty
bitterness
a
nice
lingering
roasted
barley
flavor
sticks
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
thick
with
a
nice
mild
tingle
from
the
carbonation
reminding
you
that
its
there
though
not
in
a
dominant
fashion
drinkability
very
nice
stout
with
a
lot
of
different
flavors
going
on
one
of
the
more
interestingcomplex
nonimperial
stouts
ive
tried
kind
of
like
shakespeare
stout
but
a
bit
more
ballsy
and
earthy
that
being
said
the
drinkability
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
opt
for
this
as
a
session
beer
by
any
means
though
im
not
in
a
big
stout
mood
these
days
its
a
well
balanced
interesting
flavorful
and
bold
stout
this
tastes
pretty
good
for
a
sweet
stout
again
the
tastes
mirror
the
scents
pretty
well
as
im
tasting
dark
chocolate
coffee
nuts
and
some
winelike
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
little
weak
slightly
watery
it
looks
thick
but
goes
down
a
little
thin
all
in
all
not
bad
give
it
a
try
all
in
all
the
finest
milk
stout
ive
ever
had
i
venture
to
a
decent
stout
now
and
then
and
this
one
i
really
like
black
as
night
nice
creamy
think
head
nose
does
remind
one
of
licorice
its
nice
to
have
a
stout
not
heavy
on
the
coffee
chocolate
flavor
the
licorice
is
faintly
there
toasty
surprising
bit
of
hops
for
a
stout
which
nicely
licks
off
the
whole
package
worth
a
buy
anytime
if
your
into
guinness
or
english
stouts
give
this
one
a
try
the
flavor
comparison
is
insane
head
to
head
overall
another
excellent
offering
from
bells
only
wish
we
could
get
this
here
in
the
great
beer
desert
of
texas
st
arnolds
being
the
oasis
highly
recommend
for
me
too
bitter
to
want
to
make
a
session
beer
if
available
but
this
would
be
a
player
in
the
changeup
rotation
d
very
good
rather
complex
without
being
a
very
big
beer
seems
to
be
a
theme
for
this
beer
quite
impressive
for
its
size
nothing
crazy
but
a
killer
example
of
a
robust
american
stout
i
dont
agree
with
the
milksweet
stout
classification
at
all
a
very
drinkable
delicious
stout
at
6
0
abv
go
for
two
or
three
never
once
did
it
cross
my
mind
that
this
might
be
strong
enough
as
the
6
50
abv
would
indicate
the
deep
brown
hue
with
the
traces
of
crimson
at
the
edges
indicates
that
this
has
a
softer
tone
to
it
than
other
beers
in
its
style
and
if
you
can
handle
a
strong
chocolate
aftertaste
that
subtly
lingers
this
is
worth
going
out
of
the
way
to
find
if
root
beer
could
be
made
for
adults
it
would
probably
resemble
this
great
thickness
and
mellowmoderate
carbonation
which
is
just
the
way
i
enjoy
my
stouts
a
very
good
drink
overall
and
cant
wait
to
buy
again
along
with
other
bells
brews
bells
knows
how
to
knock
their
stouts
out
of
the
park
and
this
is
no
exception
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
and
one
of
the
best
of
its
style
highly
recommended
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
and
kinda
milky
when
it
first
hits
the
tongue
its
followed
a
roasted
malt
warmness
and
a
slight
bit
off
coffee
bitters
it
then
finishes
with
a
complete
turn
around
with
the
same
characteristics
that
were
found
in
the
front
its
light
carbonation
and
little
less
than
medium
body
make
it
an
easy
drinker
i
enjoyed
the
nice
dark
flavor
i
also
like
the
old
school
no
frills
label
which
i
think
microbrewerys
sometimes
go
too
far
on
many
purchase
a
beer
based
on
the
graphics
on
the
label
see
anyone
who
likes
saranac
beers
despite
all
the
quality
attributes
of
this
beer
i
do
find
it
to
not
be
particularly
distinguished
against
the
competition
exceptional
and
wont
ruin
the
checkbook
what
more
could
a
guy
ask
for
this
beer
is
just
like
a
good
dog
always
there
never
fussy
will
be
the
same
today
and
tomorrow
no
frills
and
will
stand
by
you
through
thick
and
thin
what
more
could
you
want
mellow
roasted
flavors
licorice
milky
consistency
goes
down
fairly
easily
but
quite
filling
nice
lighter
colored
tan
head
on
top
this
jet
fuel
black
liquid
head
retention
is
fair
aroma
faint
coffee
grounds
milklike
sweetness
a
pinch
of
cocao
as
for
flavor
this
is
very
coffeelike
roasted
ground
coffee
but
theres
a
little
more
carbonation
than
i
like
here
anyway
very
roasted
flavor
a
slight
sweetness
akin
to
creamer
keeps
this
beer
in
balance
if
you
like
your
stouts
robust
and
roasty
this
is
one
to
grab
drinkability
is
a
high
point
this
goes
down
easy
and
would
make
a
good
session
stout
would
have
again
this
beer
has
a
nice
creamy
texture
with
a
fairly
mild
amount
of
carbonation
which
really
lends
itself
to
the
creaminess
throughout
a
really
good
offering
from
bells
as
far
as
im
concerned
id
put
this
stout
in
my
top
five
for
any
variety
ris
dry
irish
milk
stout
oatmeal
etc
this
is
a
sexy
stout
overall
very
nice
satisfying
stout
d
very
drinkable
this
reminds
me
of
why
i
used
to
drink
a
lot
of
stouts
pours
black
like
oil
with
a
medium
tan
head
aroma
of
roast
maltcocoand
coffee
this
brew
has
a
very
smooth
creamy
falvor
with
notes
of
licorice
raisin
smoke
vanilla
coffeeand
so
onand
so
on
i
could
find
no
fault
with
this

i

it
made

get
your
beer
on
notes
again
another
good
stout
from
bells
but
i
really
did
not
detect
any
licorice
i
have
read
in
others
reviews
after
publishing
mine
for
the
first
time
that
the
licorice
is
sublte
subtle
would
be
the
minimum
word
that
i
would
use
to
describe
it
if
anything
there
is
a
shade
of
it
in
the
taste
spectrum
for
a
more
classic
stout
look
for
bells
expedition
i
love
the
bells
dark
offerings
they
generally
add
more
hop
character
than
most
this
works
out
really
well
in
their
stout
offerings
i
lived
in
kalamazoo
so
maybe
im
partial
nice
black
pour
with
a
dark
tan
head
standard
stout
flavors
intense
as
with
any
bells
i
will
say
as
ive
seen
in
reviews
for
this
that
most
bells
beers
are
not
all
that
well
balanced
the
special
double
cream
stout
is
slightly
better
id
rate
this
one
2nd
in
their
stable
poured
from
bottle
to
a
sam
perfect
pint
pours
a
slick
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
smells
of
dark
chocolate
light
alcohol
some
dark
sugar
taste
is
of
very
bitter
chocolate
with
a
coffee
like
finish
i
get
the
slightest
bit
of
black
licorice
on
the
sides
of
my
tongue
as
the
aftertaste
very
different
bitter
type
milk
stout
tends
to
take
on
a
medicinal
aroma
as
it
warms
as
well
good
original
beer
must
try
beer
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
its
well
made
and
has
solid
attributes
i
had
read
a
lot
of
good
things
about
this
beer
and
was
not
the
least
bit
disappointed
good
job

this
is
one
of
the
more
perfect
stouts
that
i
have
had
i
normally
go
much
higher
for
imperials
but
this
had
everything
in
it
that
i
could
ever
ask
for
killer
pours
a
dark

with
a

aroma
of

roasted

with

and
dark

nice
bitter
dry

with
strong
chocolate
roasted
coffee
and
icorice
aftertaste
pretty
good
although
after
trying
other
bell
beers
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
pours
black
with
a
very
thin
dark
tan
head
nose
is
a
good
bit
of
roasted
and
molasses
tones
flavor
brings
the
same
with
an
almost
oat
bitter
tone
that
mixes
in
very
hearty
and
robust
nearly
a
meal
in
itself
smooth
liquid
feel
low
carbonation
a
nice
winter
time
beer
its
30something
outside
and
this
is
precisely
what
i
should
be
drinking
d
good
to
session
but
not
something
to
really
seek
out
great
beer
for
the
colder
months
and
a
fine
offering
from
bells
regular
lineup
very
highly
recommended
drinkability
surprisingly
good
given
the
concoction
of
flavors
here
alcohols
wellhidden
and
reasonably
low
though
perhaps
on
the
highend
for
the
style
but
what
it
really
comes
down
to
are
the
flavors
and
aromas
here
and
though
theyre
bizarre
theyre
strangely
not
as
offputting
as
they
should
be
anise
cocoa
heavilyroasted
coffee
all
wrapped
up
in
a
dirt
bow
sounds
weird
but
give
it
a
shot
i
cant
believe
i
hadnt
had
this
before
it
pours
a
thick
oily
blackness
with
a
light
chocolate
brown
head
the
smell
is
chocolatey
but
the
taste
is
a
great
roasted
coffeeness
its
a
nice
heavy
body
and
the
coffee
flavors
are
apparent
as
soon
as
it
touches
the
tongue
its
incredibly
flavorful
and
if
you
like
this
style
of
stout
then
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
it
remains
drinkable
despite
its
thickness
ill
definitely
be
buying
this
again
and
often
i
was
hoping
for
somthing
a
bit
more
thick
and
creamy
as
the
nose
and
flavors
may
have
hinted
towards
still
a
terrific
beer
id
give
it
an
a
if
it
were
more
thick
and
creamy
notes
from
71805
d
the
slightly
lighter
body
and
complex
flavor
profile
add
to
the
drinkability
of
this
very
good
sweet
stout
another
winner
from
the
bells
lineup
notes
i
dont
know
if
this
one
really
qualifies
as
a
sweet
stout
but
nonetheless
it
is
one
fullbodied
smoothoperator
that
is
quite
the
tasty
brew
i
really
liked
the
interesting
twist
of
licorice
that
this
one
brings
to
the
table
unusual
but
pleasant
overall
its
a
very
good
stout
that
i
will
definitely
have
again
in
the
near
future
d
pretty
good
stout
and
a
complex
one
at
that
there
are
certainly
lots
of
flavors
and
aromas
to
unearth
from
this
brew
ive
been
on
a
stout
kick
lately
so
it
was
nice
to
try
this
one
after
having
it
sit
in
the
fridge
for
about
six
months
drinkability
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
its
a
litlte
more
pricey
than
i
prefer
although
still
very
reasonable
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
beers
out
there
and
the
taste
and
feel
of
it
is
a
nice
changeup
i
rated
it
a
little
higher
than
i
thought
i
would
but
its
got
a
lot
going
for
it
d
never
had
a
memorable
milk
sweet
stout
before
this
one
and
then
this
came
and
broke
the
bank
bells
has
a
huge
winner
here
this
is
an
amazing
brew
which
is
amongst
the
elite
ive
had
at
this
point
ive
been
wanting
to
try
more
bells
and
this
has
me
officially
hooked
im
on
the
lookout
for
more
of
their
luscious
stouts
now
d
it
was
a
nice
and
enjoyable
midwinter
late
night
sipper
not
a
great
session
beer
unless
the
session
is
two
bottles
long
its
heavy
and
too
rich
for
a
long
session
yeah
we
can
see
why
this
beer
has
cult
status
this
stout
is
so
robust
you
can
almost
chew
it
big
thumbs
up
for
the
subtle
and
artful
addition
of
licorice
for
a
pairing
try
some
rosemary
beerbraised
lamb
lollipops
or
even
an
oldfashioned
pot
roast
looks
like
a
stout
dark
opaque
smaller
head
chocolate
milk
foam
color
nice
denisty
smell
is
chocolate
malt
molassas
and
playdoe
what
i
think
i
may
have
a
bad
bottle
on
my
hands
had
a
yeast
aspect
but
not
bready
thicker
i
wouldnt
go
for
this
one
if
you
expect
a
sweet
milk
stout
its
mild
in
all
aspects
d
something
just
doesnt
seem
quite
right
here
its
burnt
nature
seems
to
throw
everything
off
balance
the
bottle
says
its
brewed
with
brewers
licorice
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
licorice
and
this
one
seems
overly
astringent
for
the
style
its
certainly
interesting
but
i
cant
say
id
have
more
than
one
a
great
coffee
stout
bells
really
does
some
great
stuff
and
im
usually
very
impressed
with
their
offerings
this
is
definitely
one
of
their
finest
an
absolutely
brilliant
beer
from
bells
the
best
ive
had
of
theirs
and
one
of
the
best
sweet
stouts
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
a
solid
straightforward
no
bullshit
beer
a
very
enjoyable
stout
with
great
flavor
and
balance
would
highly
recommend
and
look
forward
to
another
d
easy
drinking
tasty
stout
overall
this
is
a
spectacular
showing
by
bells
not
sweet
like
a
milk
stout
but
a
nice
big
bold
stout
that
deserves
another
go
d
this
was
a
very
nice
stout
its
dark
and
toasty
and
the
anise
note
is
very
well
balanced
perfect
for
mn
winter
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
shaker
glass
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
healthy
three
fingers
of
fluffy
ecru
colored
head
smells
of
milk
chocolate
roasted
grains
coffee
and
anise
seed
tastes
like
a
mocha
coffee
with
a
shot
of
black
sambuca
added
to
it
minus
the
alcohol
burn
rather
complex
with
a
bitter
finish
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
a
nice
bitter
stout
that
i
like
to
revisit
from
time
to
time
this
is
a
gratifyingly
rich
and
satisfying
beer
it
has
as
much
flavor
as
some
smaller
imperial
stouts
but
with
less
alcohol
and
heaviness
an
excellent
beer
to
take
you
from
fall
into
winter
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
tap
or
better
yet
on
cask
ive
tried
a
lot
of
beers
in
this
style
and
its
a
little
hard
to
choose
a
lot
of
the
time
this
one
has
its
own
unique
character
and
its
a
little
more
iced
coffee
than
the
dark
hot
mochas
of
other
milk
stouts
enjoyable
and
worth
a
reccommendation
bells
kalamazoo
stout
pours
a
creamy
dark
as
night
black
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
it
smells
of
burnt
grains
and
roasted
coffee
with
sweetness
that
i
cant
pinpoint
it
tastes
much
like
it
smells
which
is
great
its
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
mild
crispness
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
like
all
stouts
its
pretty
filling
and
a
bit
thick
all
in
all
another
great
beer
from
bells
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
allows
you
to
partake
in
a
couple
not
heavy
but
has
enough
meat
in
its
body
its
almost
as
if
you
want
another
one
just
to
experience
it
all
again
d
i
am
not
too
crazy
about
it
just
a
decent
milk
stout
to
me
definitely
not
standoutish
but
glad
i
could
try
it
poured
to
a
good
two
inch
head
head
was
light
brown
in
color
stout
was
black
in
appearance
head
hung
around
awhile
and
had
some
good
lacing
that
left
rings
with
every
swallow
smelled
a
slight
sweet
cream
coffee
and
malt
had
a
strong
burnt
coffee
taste
with
again
a
slight
cream
had
a
slight
burnt
coffee
bitter
aftertaste
that
seemed
to
linger
in
your
mouth
felt
good
in
the
mouth
i
thought
the
carbonation
was
right
almost
felt
a
little
thicker
i
would
enjoy
these
on
a
cool
october
day
like
this
one
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
brew
of
choice
on
a
hot
summer
day
ill
buy
again
and
perhaps
this
fall
once
again
d
a
nice
drinkable
stout
from
bells
with
it
not
being
distributed
here
i
dont
think
ill
have
it
for
a
while
but
ill
definitely
revisit
it
if
given
the
chance
body
is
mediumheavy
and
oily
more
suited
to
a
double
stout
but
where
does
it
say
that
milk
stouts
cant
be
thick
definitely
drinkable
if
you
like
roast
and
coffee
flavors
i
dont
however
a
good
session
stout
but
its
not
my
first
choice
drink
is
very
good
wish
it
was
a
little
higher
abv
for
its
desert
style
taste
all
in
all
a
good
beer
i
would
grab
it
again
i
would
really
like
to
try
it
off
cask
the
nose
on
the
beer
has
a
sweetness
that
comes
through
with
a
great
hint
of
roastiness
the
beer
is
super
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
about
a
centimeter
in
height
with
good
retention
looks
beautiful
not
much
carbonation
though
the
flavour
of
this
beer
is
pretty
roasty
and
not
very
sweet
i
dont
think
this
is
a
sweet
stout
but
the
flavours
are
quite
strong
they
have
a
good
mixture
of
roasted
barley
with
chocolate
the
bitterness
comes
from
the
roasted
malts
and
the
hops
are
far
in
the
background
the
beer
is
pretty
creamy
with
a
bite
from
carbonation
the
beer
is
drinkable
d
not
bad
but
just
not
great
good
stout
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
d
too
much
bitterness
for
me
to
drink
it
so
quickly
but
its
a
decent
stout
looks
and
smells
wonderful
with
a
solid
flavor
definitely
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
hadits
almost
like
a
rislite
d
this
is
a
great
stout
it
definitely
holds
its
own
in
the
flavor
and
interest
departments
for
me
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
my
first
stout
tried
was
guinness
at
the
factory
in
dublin
and
this
is
no
guinness
though
american
guinness
is
not
either
sadly
this
stacks
up
well
as
a
stout
in
its
own
right
due
to
the
nice
licorice
hints
pours
dark
as
can
be
a
little
dark
cherry
color
around
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
with
nice
thick
dark
tan
head
lacing
is
ok
retention
isnt
great
but
a
very
thin
cream
is
left
on
the
beer
for
the
remainder
smell
is
of
dark
sweet
chocolate
some
coffee
grinds
and
a
tiny
bit
of
black
licorice
taste
is
great
let
this
one
warm
up
and
it
has
a
sweet
milk
chocolateness
too
it
very
pronounced
chocolate
flavor
with
some
toasted
grains
as
well
very
slight
bitterness
as
it
goes
down
but
i
dont
detect
any
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
velvety
more
on
the
fuller
side
this
is
a
great
beer
from
bells
i
must
say
this
might
be
my
favorite
right
up
there
with
two
hearted
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
stout
it
has
great
aroma
and
flavor
a
good
sessions
ale
very
velvety
smooth
with
taste
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
slightly
sweet
with
slight
hoppy
finish
brussels
lace
hung
nicely
down
side
of
glass
a
very
smooth
drinking
delicious
stout
drinkability
very
solid
beer
im
so
glad
bells
is
now
distributed
in
florida
d
solidly
drinkable
very
very
tasty
and
before
i
even
realized
it
my
glass
was
empty
nice
and
smooth
couterpoint
stuck
between
this
beer
and
the
bells
porter
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
with
some
complexity
and
uniqueness
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
very
drinkable
carbonation
is
just
right
dability
a
heavyweight
stout
even
if
just
6
5
abv
but
a
good
choice
if
in
the
mood
for
a
big
flavorful
stout
i
could
see
myself
buying
it
again
but
drinking
it
a
bit
cooler
d
overall
a
good
stout
with
an
easy
drinking
quality
this
is
such
an
amazing
beer
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anybody
i
am
so
impressed
with
bells
on
this
one
drinks
easy
a
good
not
great
stout
middle
of
the
road
as
bells
offerings
go
the
kalamazoo
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
some
small
reddish
brown
light
slivers
and
a
2
finger
brown
head
after
a
rigorous
pour
a
subtle
but
direct
nose
of
big
roasted
chocolate
malts
same
is
with
the
taste
toasty
chocolate
malt
and
coffee
notes
are
right
upfront
followed
by
semisweet
bakers
chocolate
molasses
and
brown
sugar
the
flavors
of
the
licorice
used
is
very
subtle
and
by
no
means
threatening
this
stout
is
so
toasty
it
simply
adds
more
complexity
and
pleasant
bold
nuances
some
hop
bitterness
is
detected
on
the
finish
as
well
as
some
slight
alcohol
heat
it
sports
a
surprisingly
lightmedium
body
very
smooth
and
sort
of
creamy
the
after
taste
is
long
lingering
and
very
enjoyable
excellent
beer
must
try
d
i
love
this
stuff
and
i
say
that
while
admitting
i
like
bigger
heavier
stouts
ill
always
be
happy
to
bring
it
home
this
brew
poured
up
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
brown
head
perfect
little
appearance
the
nose
was
delicious
dark
chocolate
malts
love
it
the
taste
was
very
nice
and
straight
forward
subtle
sweetness
and
dark
chocolate
malts
subtle
alcohol
blended
in
the
flavor
not
bad
at
all
though
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
a
sixer
drinkability
not
bad
not
great
one
was
enough
i
like
the
color
its
nice
and
dark
the
aroma
is
quite
pleasant
and
the
feel
is
robust
but
not
to
thick
the
taste
was
surprisingly
hoppy
for
the
style
not
that
i
really
minded
bitter
resinous
hops
coated
the
palate
while
bakers
chocolate
and
black
licorice
added
a
great
balance
the
chewy
thick
body
was
perfectly
carbonated
and
the
hop
bite
at
the
finish
made
the
experience
all
the
more
enjoyable
bells
makes
very
few
brewing
erros
and
kalamazoo
isnt
one
of
them
not
by
a
long
shot
taste
wise
is
melasse
flavours
with
shy
licorise
malty
dark
chocolate
with
a
shy
bitterness
some
hints
of
coffee
notes
are
present
too
im
very
picky
with
stouts
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
dont
like
too
much
roasted
malt
flavor
and
this
certainly
isnt
heavy
it
is
a
great
balanced
stout
with
just
enough
of
everything
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
12
ouncer
with
different
art
work
then
shown
on
this
site
no
freshness
into
be
had
this
one
pours
stout
black
dark

well
knot
retentive
and
then
leaves
plenty
of
slippery
and
then
sticky
lace

of

dark

and
roasty
silky
as
it
rides
over
the
tongue
and
swirls
in
the

top
notch
in
all
ways
more
fine
suds
from
bells
pours
an
opache
black
with
a
small
tannish
head
aroma
is
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
maybe
just
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
buried
underneath
all
of
the
dark
malt
flavor
is
really
more
of
the
same
although
the
fruit
shines
through
a
bit
more
finishes
somewhat
short
and
cocoa
bitter
medium
bodied
very
smooth
texture
pours
a
black
color
topped
with
just
a
thin
brown
head
aroma
is
roasted
chocolate
and
malts
but
rather
mild
there
is
however
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
to
this
one
it
starts
off
with
a
nice
rich
toasty
dark
chocolate
flavor
blended
in
with
malts
and
traces
of
coffee
in
the
background
a
bitter
aftertaste
lingers
a
while
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
in
between
sips
i
keep
tasting
a
roasted
almost
burned
dark
chocolate
bitter
flavor
this
is
good
overall
very
good
stout
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
the
softness
of
it
would
lead
to
several
brews
something
one
cant
get
with
many
heavy
hittin
craft
brew
stouts
d
an
enjoyable
and
reasonably
complex
beer
pretty
drinkable
but
with
this
level
of
sweetness
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
the
chocolate
notes
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
particularly
nice
overall
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
it
is
a
very
good
one
worth
a
shot
done
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
had
in
a
while
i
have
been
very
hit
or
miss
with
bells
and
this
is
for
sure
a
direct
hit
definitely
a
good
stout
worth
the
money
you
pay
for
it
a
decent
stout
the
licorice
is
a
nice
touch
id
buy
it
again
but
not
really
seek
it
out
another
day
another
great
beer
from
bells
pours
to
a
thick
rich
head
of
dark
tan
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
somewhat
muted
i
get
some
tree
bark
coffee
and
roasted
malts
with
a
faint
sweet
note
what
this
lacks
in
the
nose
is
made
up
for
in
taste
and
body
wow
black
licorice
roasted
coffee
and
a
nutty
bitter
finish
that
lasts
and
lasts
all
of
this
is
nicely
built
on
top
of
a
rich
thick
sweet
frame
i
will
be
keeping
more
of
this
around
as
our
nights
begin
to
cool
this
beer
tastes
and
smells
of
bitter
chocolatecoffee
raisins
and
has
a
big
malt
profile
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
i
absolutely
love
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
very
smooth
drinkability
is
relativly
high
on
this
one
a
great
session
beer
even
with
the
abv
being
a
little
higher
d
a
damn
fine
stout
despite
the
abv
its
still
a
session
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
drink
again
the
taste
on
this
one
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
compared
to
bells
other
stouts
i
didnt
find
it
that
interesting
i
really
really
dug
java
double
cream
and
expedition
stouts
but
i
didnt
find
this
one
to
be
as
interesting
excellent
mouthfeel
saves
this
though
its
certainly
not
bad
i
think
my
expectations
for
bells
are
now
very
high
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
a
bit
dry
and
the
drinkability
is
way
up
there
d
sip
or
go
on
and
indulge
a
little
more
carefree
it
is
suitable
for
either
which
is
a
a
plus
an
interesting
flavour
contrast
this
one
might
take
a
couple
experiences
to
really
get
a
feel

id
have
this

again
a
really
solid
brew
d
a
good
overall
stout
ive
had
better
though
could
probably
only
have
about
2
consecutively
before
my
mouth
was
overpowered
i
could
definitely
see
myself
buying
more
of
this
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
american
stout
category
very
tasty
very
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
another
great
beer
from
bells
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
from
bells
cant
wait
to
get
me
some
more
this
is
definitely
not
your
normal
stout
but
i
rather
enjoyed
it
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
wanting
to
try
something
new
or
during
a
large
hearty
meal
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
it
drinkability
is
pretty
top
notch
while
the
flavor
does
somewhat
fade
quickly
the
overall
brew
as
a
whole
is
nicely
done
a
good
bells
beer
overall
a
very
drinkable
example
of
the
style
that
i
feel
falls
a
bit
flat
on
mouthfeel
and
taste
i
tend
to
lean
more
towards
the
double
cream
though
however
this
is
a
good
starting
point
for
a
stout
and
if
you
like
it
already
seek
out
the
double
cream
for
more
of
the
goodness
a
likeable
fairly
straightforward
stout
roasty
aromas
and
flavors
dominate
with
some
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
and
a
solid
licorice
presence
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
and
the
reasonable
abv
makes
this
a
nice
one
to
spend
a
quiet
evening
with
this
isnt
one
of
those
stouts
where
every
sip
is
a
long
flavor
journey
but
whats
there
is
quite
pleasant
bells
seems
to
excel
at
making
solid
yet
approachable
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
overall
a
very
drinkable
interpretation
of
a
stout
nothing
to
set
it
apart
from
the
pack
but
a
pretty
good
beer
d
easy
to
drink
just
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
black
in
color
with
a
mocha
colored
head
after
pouring
from
a
bottle
nose
is
so
faint
that
i
am
not
even
able
to
place
it
it
teases
but
doesnt
make
itself
available
coffee
flavor
is
very
strong
and
there
appears
to
be
a
strong
flavor
of
anise
that
i
am
guessing
comes
from
the
brewers
licorice
heavy
smoke
flavor
i
rated
it
a
c
but
must
admit
that
it
varied
from
many
of
the
normal
stouts
you
might
try
so
it
almost
dares
you
to
try
and
pin
it
down
d
drinkability
is
okay
but
not
much
higher
than
other
sweet
stouts
and
i
really
didnt
like
the
mouthfeel
with
the
sting
on
my
tongue
enjoyable
brew
as
drinkable
as
you
can
get
with
a
stout
d
very
drinkable
easy
to
drink
not
overly
sweet
md
smooth
clean
crisp
a
great
stout
from
a
great
brewery
poured
thickly
from
a
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
darkest
brown
you
can
imagine
bordering
on
black
with
an
inch
of
chocolate
milk
colored
foam
leaving
moderate
lacing
not
getting
much
from
the
smell
just
some
graininess
and
roasted
malts
taste
is
slightly
bitter
and
dry
with
hints
of
burnt
caramel
roasted
coffee
beans
and
bitter
bakers
chocolate
very
thick
and
fullbodied
and
light
on
the
carbonation
as
somewhat
average
representation
of
the
style
i
prefer
their
special
double
cream
stout
myself
this
certainly
was
my
second
favorite
taste
the
eccentric
cafe
last
night
this
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
tan
head
once
i
smelled
this
beer
i
knew
i
was
in
love
very
complex
with
deep
rich
coffee
smells
chocolate
and
other
yummy
things
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
just
as
delightful
as
the
smell
very
complex
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
amount
of
flavor
they
were
able
to
fit
into
this
beer
very
well
done
again
another
beer
i
will
suggest
to
my
local
beer
distributor
bells
kalamazoo
stout
pours
a
medium
thick
black
with
a
short
tanish
head
the
smell
is
moderately
strong
of
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
hint
of
liquorice
taste
is
very
malty
with
just
a
touch
of
tart
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
light
to
moderately
thick
and
has
a
low
amount
of
carbonation
the
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
just
enough
for
a
really
nice
feel
overall
drinkability
is
good
i
wish
this
had
more
flavor
but
the
silky
smoothness
goes
a
long
way
and
makes
this
one
quite
enjoyable
d
good

smell
coffee
taste
that
holds
in
the
mouth
with
licorice
in
the
back
i
rated
it
a
4
in
taste
because
i
dont
like
coffee
but
if
i
liked
coffee
i
would
rate
higher
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
it
is
a
smoothe
stout
drink
em
if
ya
got
em
d
a
decent
session
beer
probably
not
something
i
would
drink
one
after
the
other
of
but
for
a
stout
its
nicely
drinkable
mediumbodied
dry
and
somewhat
crisp

with
a
lingering
sticky

taste
follows
through
with
additional
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
really
nice
finish
bubbles
are
a
bit
more
than
id
normally
like
but
otherwise
a
pretty
smooth
brew
with
a
more
than
decent
taste
usually
more
of
a
fan
of
the
more
hop
forward
bells

this
one
impressed
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
lots
of
texture
roasty
drybitter
finish
delicious
one
of
my
most
favorite
stouts
from
bells
d
good
stuff
dark
and
a
bit
thick
with
a
little
head
smell
is
smoky
and
complex
and
the
taste
follows
that
lead
with
notes
of
molasses
and
dark
roasted
malts
at
the
end
of
the
glass
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
wish
i
had
more
of
bells
knows
what
theyre
doing
with
their
line
of
stouts
for
sure
another
kick
ass
offering
from
bells
these
guys
know
how
to
get
it
done
pours
out
very
dark
with
a
lot
of
creamy
caramel
colored
head
lacing
was
very
good
the
smell
is
very
strong
lots
of
roasted
malts
the
malts
pretty
much
dominate
the
smell
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
was
outstanding
once
again
the
roasted
malts
dominate
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
fullbodied
also
has
a
very
thick
almost
syrupy
feel
overall
this
beer
was
excellent
and
a
definite
recommendation
to
anybody
that
likes
stouts
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
pours
thick
black
with
a
good
tan
head
that
leaves
good
lace
nose
is
of
roasted
malt
some
copper
taste
is
quite
good
with
great
roasted
malt
flavor
a
great
sweetness
that
is
nice
and
mellow
rather
than
sickly
thick
very
robust
some
slight
coffee
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
flavor
nice
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
that
is
just
about
perfect
very
crisp
and
snappy
mouthfeel
which
is
refreshing
drinkability
is
quite
good
for
the
style
would
love
to
session
this
one
if
it
was
locally
available
defenitely
would
be
a
go
to
stout
for
me
too
bad
i
live
on
the
ends
of
the
earth
defenitely
a
unique
and
impressive
stout
from
bells
has
inspired
me
to
dig
out
one
of
my
expeditions
and
try
it
again
this
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
all
around
stout
breweries
great
d
overall
a
stout
that
packs
a
lot
of
punch
and
is
yet
easy
to
drink
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
expedition
except
i
found
this
to
be
more
balanced
one
thing
i
have
noticed
about
bells
stout
is
that
they
seem
to
have
some
earthiness
and
some
bitterness
to
it
that
you
have
to
get
used
to
however
i
was
rather
impressed
by
this
one
and
it
would
be
a
great
one
to
have
as
a
session
stout
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
smooth
and
easygoing
stout
that
does
not
overpower
the
palate
but
provides
rich
and
complex
flavors
at
the
same
time
a
solid
offering
from
bells
cheers
big
full
body
smooth
and
creamy
just
a
little
chewy
tastes
and
drinks
much
bigger
than
your
typical
6
5
beer
which
takes
a
notch
away
from
the
drinkability
the
flavor
and
complexity
does
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
not
quite
a
sipper
but
not
a
session
beer
either
what
ever
it
can
be
classified
as
this
is
one
damn
good
beer
d
one
is
enough
for
this
average
brew
d
it
has
a
slight
drying
after
taste
that
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
for
its
style
its
much
more
drinkable
than
most
but
its
far
from
a
session
beer
t
full
bodied
very
thick
and
creamy
but
not
as
cloying
or
lactosey
as
some
other
milk
stouts
body
has
a
slightly
stronger
nutty
chocolate
taste
than
expected
and
lots
of
rich
roasted
malts
aftertaste
is
more
chocolate
than
milk
throughout
there
is
a
subtle
hop
bitterness
providing
nice
balance
one
of
my
favorite
easy
drinking
stouts
not
just
for
milk
stouts
pours
pitch
black
with
small
cocoa
head
sweet
aroma
of
chocolate
caramel
and
unknown
spice
perhaps
clove
tastes
of
mediumsweet
chocolate
roasted
coffee
clove
with
delicious
slightly
sourbitter
ending
on
back
of
tongue
that
lasts
everything
in
perfect
balance
creamy
rich
mouthfeel
easy
drinker
but
not
sure
about
sessioning
this
one
nonetheless
its
a
fine
standalone
beer
should
go
well
with
red
meat
bottle
code
on
back
is
7837
indicating
it
was
bottled
on
feb
21st
2007
so
its
a
about
13
months
old
perhaps
past
its
peak
or
getting
close
has
sort
of
a
soy
or
slightly
sour
dark
malt
smell
to
it
the
taste
has
a
little
creaminess
in
flavor
maybe
from
added
lactose
some
very
mellow
coffee
in
the
background
but
not
much
else
in
terms
of
roasted
flavor
not
bad
this
one
is
probably
better
right
when
it
comes
out
of
the
tanks
this
poured
pitch
black
with
a
little
bit
of
dark
tan
head
it
smelled
like
a
cappuccino
with
dominant
milk
and
coffee
scents
and
a
bit
of
licorice
that
it
was
brewed
with
it
tasted
stronger
than
expected
like
bitter
coffee
and
burnt
chocolate
mixed
with
the
surprising
presence
of
floral
hops
it
was
slightly
thick
with
no
carbonation
and
a
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
stout
with
some
unique
characteristics
but
it
wasnt
the
best
of
bells
brews
definitely
something
to
sip
and
enjoy
its
a
heavy
stout
but
very
drinkable
medium
alcohol
level
but
after
a
few
you
know
youve
been
drinking
it
d
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
milksweet
stout
it
was
ok
there
are
way
too
many
other
stouts
out
there
that
blow
this
out
of
the
water
to
spend
too
much
time
here
again
taste
mouthfeel
dark
chocolate
and
light
roast
coffee
in
even
portions
with
a
nice
creamy
backbone
the
use
of
brewers
licorice
lends
a
spicy
undercurrent
though
its
subtle
enough
that
it
doesnt
distract
from
the
malt
great
mouthfeel
velvety
and
rich
but
not
overly
thick
the
dryness
of
the
finish
really
enhances
the
drinkability
for
me
as
im
generally
not
a
huge
fan
of
beers
that
are
sweet
from
beginning
to
end
great
stuff
here
probably
a
top
example
of
the
style
d
very
enjoyable
this
stuff
goes
down
way
too
easily
great
brew
if
you
see
it
dont
hesitate
recommended
thanks
a
bunch
steve
this
is
a
really
nice
stout
and
easy
to
drink
for
sure
highly
recommended
overall
an
enjoyable
classic
stout
with
great
chocolatemalty
flavor
recommended
d
this
gets
3
5
only
because
its
a
bit
much
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
very
good
once
in
a
while
however
and
should
be
on
anyones
list
who
can
get
it
so
easy
to
drink
that
this
would
be
perfect
to
session
nice
tasty
beer
d
this
is
a
definite
sipper
that
grew
on
me
i
decided
to
hold
off
on
tasting
notes
until
i
had
a
second
later
in
the
week
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
much
but
the
subtle
nose
and
delicate
palate
made
up
ground
for
me
this
would
probably
pair
well
with
sweet
desserts
to
help
cut
that
bitter
closing
d
best
cream
stout
i
have
had
i
love
the
complex
roasted
character
and
the
creamy
feel
very
easy
drinking
bold
and
delicious
a
very
drinkable
stout
much
better
than
i
expected
from
some
reveiws
and
i
will
certainly
have
more
of
these
this
is
a
stout
for
those
who
love
that
roasted
barley
bite
md
this
is
a
great
creamy
beer
that
leaves
a
great
sensation
on
the
palate
i
love
it
good
times
its
got
a
big
imperiallike
flavor
but
with
the
mouthfeel
of
a
regular
stout
i
really
enjoyed
it
as
it
opens
with
a
nice
roasted
taste
and
ends
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
the
riss
ive
been
drinking
overall
a
quality
stout
pours
basically
opaque
black
with
a
sticky
staying
big
tan
head
smell
is
big
and
roasty
at
first
with
some
dryness
about
it
as
it
opened
up
i
didnt
enjoy
the
smell
quite
as
much
tastes
of
dry
unsweetened
roastiness
but
with
a
tart
soy
flavor
creeping
up
more
and
more
as
i
drank
it
creamy
nice
body
and
mouthfeel
with
good
a
carbonation
level
but
i
get
the
roast
soy
flavor
more
than
coffee
and
chocolate
still
not
bad
but
just
had
a
component
im
not
crazy
about
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
smokestack
goblet
pours
an
opaque
black
that
turns
slightly
red
when
held
to
the
light
when
poured
it
has
a
rocky
tan
head
that
turned
into
a
thin
oily
layer
that
left
flecks
of
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
up
front
like
cream
from
whole
milk
then
it
melds
into
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
instant
coffee
taste
is
dark
chocolate
and
then
milk
sugar
this
isnt
a
horribly
complex
beer
in
its
taste
but
it
isnt
a
negative
either
mouthfeel
is
thin
honestly
thinner
than
i
would
have
wanted
its
a
really
drinkable
beer
and
a
6
5
it
makes
it
that
much
more
drinkable
this
beer
poured
a
nice
black
color
wit
a
huge
rocky
tan
head
the
aroma
was
chocolate
and
espresso
the
taste
was
of
light
coffee
almost
a
ground
coffee
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
heavy
with
very
little
carbonation
overall
this
beer
was
great
bells
makes
some
great
beer
da
good
medium
sort
of
stout
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
a
good
drink
drinkability
well
its
all
subjective
didnt
really
like
the
dominant
and
lingering
bitter
taste
i
wish
the
beer
would
taste
more
like
it
smelled
some
sweetness
would
help
served
in
a
nonic
poured
a
dark
opaque
brown
almost
black
with
deep
red
highlights
around
the
edges
halfinch
coffee
colored
head
quickly
dissipated
into
a
thin
skim
of
beer
algae
scent
of
malted
milk
chocolate
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
lingers
at
the
end
taste
similar
to
nose
but
also
yielded
a
pronounced
coffee
presence
and
perhaps
a
slight
hops
presence
at
the
finish
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
body
was
not
overly
full
and
alcohol
was
wellhidden
making
this
an
excellent
session
stout
wish
this
was
more
widely
distributed
in
my
area
nice
chewy
stout
the
flavors
are
complex
and
there
is
a
struggle
between
sweet
and
bitter
over
the
tongue
that
bitter
chocolate
coffee
taste
wins
out
though
with
a
similar
linger
that
sticks
with
you
way
past
the
finish
i
dont
know
that
i
necessarily
agree
with
the
sweet
stout
designation
but
i
enjoy
the
beer
just
the
same
similar
to
bells
java
stout
except
less
intense
flavorwise
close
to
a
masterpiece
without
a
doubt
served
in
a
16oz
glass
at
alibis
last
week
enjoyed
it
so
much
on
wednesday
i
returned
on
thursday
for
two
more
there
wasnt
much
of
a
head
on
this
beer
but
what
was
there
made
a
nice
creamy
top
to
my
glass
the
color
was
very
dark
but
held
to
the
light
a
faint
dark
red
came
through
the
glass
the
aroma
was
all
about
the
roasted
coffee
bean
and
this
followed
through
to
the
flavor
the
flavor
was
additionally
complex
with
dark
chocolate
and
as
others
have
mentioned
a
slight
licorice
tang
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
the
flavor
burst
made
up
for
that
i
was
really
glad
to
find
this
available
two
nights
in
a
row
md
carbonation
is
slightly
high
full
and
slightly
creamy
body
drinkability
is
good
pretty
easy
drinking
for
a
6
5
stout
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
but
overall
as
much
as
i
love
my
dark
beers
this
one
just
wasnt
what
i
was
looking
for
i
dont
think
the
flavors
meld
very
well
and
something
just
seems
misplaced
the
best
part
of
this
brew
is
the
mouthfeel
thanks
again
to
clockworksorange
and
theodorherzl
12
oz
bottle
pours
pitch
black
with
a
2
cm
foamy
tan
head
that
is
lasting
aroma
of
chocolate
dominates
the
maltiness
flavor
is
balanced
between
the
bitter
chocolate
mild
malts
and
a
hint
of
sweet
creaminess
tons
of
lacing
no
noted
carbonation
and
light
on
alcohol
medium
to
full
body
drinkable
and
great
for
when
you
want
a
big
tasting
beer
without
the
imperial
alcohol
overall
its
a
great
example
of
the
style
a
very
easy
to
drink
stout
a
nice
finish
to
the
night
if
it
was
available
i
drink
it
again
recommended
this
a
very
good
beer
and
another
winner
from
bells
super
easy
to
drink
beer
smooth
and
mellow
are
two
things
that
this
beer
has
in
spades
super
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
look
forward
to
trying
again
pours
a
dense
opaque
molasses
color
brown
head
quickly
dissipates
leaving
a
persistent
ring
aroma
is
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
is
a
sweet
expresso
flavor
with
chocolate
some
roasted
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thick
slightly
stick
with
some
tingling
carbonation
a
very
nice
sweet
stout
pretty
disappointed
with
this
one
for
the
most
part
do
not
think
it
measures
to
any
of
the
other
bells
stouts
i
have
tried
not
worth
seeking
out
if
this
beer
is
unavilable
to
you
like
it
is
for
me

with
some
of
the
other

brews
poured
a
deep
dark
almost
opaque
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
smells
slightly
of
licorice
and
coffee
starts
of
tasting
sweet
with
a
coffee
and
licorice
flavor
finishes
somewhat
drier
than
the
start
it
is
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
little
carbonation
medium
to
heavy
in
body
very
drinkable
no
off
tastes
very
much
in
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
very
deep
black
with
no
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
i
was
a
little
disappointed
on
the
head
on
this
a
small
swirl
of
tan
head
dissipated
quite
quickly
but
did
leave
solid
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
fairly
classic
for
a
sweet
stout
chocolate
and
coffee
make
way
for
molasses
and
roasted
grain
the
flavor
profiles
two
strongest
flavors
are
roasted
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
but
it
also
has
a
nice
medium
sweetness
as
well
side
flavor
characteristics
include
black
liquorice
and
toasted
grain
on
my
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
very
creamy
an
easy
drinking
stout
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
i
very
much
have
enjoyed
my
bells
variety
case
thank
you
beer
god
all
in
all
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
brew
but
strangely
sweet
for
my
taste
in
a
stout
notes
a
very
good
stout
but
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
unique
flavor
here
i
might
pick
this
up
again
a
good
experience
all
around
d
a
good
beer
by
itself
but
probably
not
one
to
drink
several
at
once
certainly
good
to
enjoy
slowly
and
sip
on
d
would
definitely
love
to
have
this
as
a
constant
beer
in
my
fridge
a
great
one
dnot
bad
i
could
have
two
but
if
there
was
other
beers
to
choose
i
might
switch
after
one
i
liked
it
enough
to
drink
it
again
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
pours
a
solid
black
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
around
the
glass
smells
of
roasted
malts
some
dried
fruit
and
a
sweet
milk
stout
smell
taste
is
sweet
lactose
some
more
of
the
dried
fruit
and
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
background
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
but
is
a
little
thin
great
sweet
stout
not
over
the
top
with
sweetness
like
so
many
of
this
style
tend
to
be
definitely
a
good
sweet
stout
i
much
prefer
the
expedition
taste
is
chocolately
with
rum
soaked
dark
fruit
nice
roasted
malt
bitterness
but
not
overly
done
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
fullbodied
nice
carbonation
level
this
is
a
beer
i
have
seen
at
my
local
shop
for
a
long
time
and
for
whatever
reason
i
had
not
picked
up
and
i
dont
know
why
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
will
become
a
regular
part
of
my
rotation
terrific
stuff

on

drinks
bigger
than
it
really
is
a
lot
of
impy
stouts
probably
wish
they
had
the
richness
and
flavour
profile
of
this
brew
one
of
the
best
non
impy
stouts
ive
had
great
work
pours
black
with
about
a
quarterinch
tan
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
though
some
lacing
remains
aroma
and
taste
are
pleasant
enough
with
roasted
flavors
and
hints
of
the
brewers
licorice
coming
through
in
the
taste
finishes
with
a
slight
bite
pours
completely
black
with
a
nice
1
inch
tan
head
of
foam
aroma
was
an
enticing
mix
of
roasted
coffee
beans
licorice
and
dark
chocolate
taste
was
very
similar
to
the
aroma
lots
of
roasted
coffee
flavor
dark
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
drinkability
was
damn
good
as
i
love
a
bold
tasting
stout
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
in
the
palate
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
another
great
beer
from
bells
mouthfeelvery
tasty
a
lower
carbonation
the
flavors
run
the
stout
spectrum
bitterness
from
the
dark
roastedblack
malts
earthy
hops
are
present
and
they
linger
with
the
finish
bittersweet
chocolate
robust
with
very
little
sweetness
a
good
froth
on
the
palate
releases
some
licorice
flavor
good
stout
and
a
solid
offering
from
bells
the
taste
consists
of
burnt
coffee
chocolate
and
other
dark
malt
flavors
it
has
a
dry
finish
and
a
bit
taken
back
by
how
dry
it
is
it
is
medium
bodied
with
excellant
carbonation
for
the
style
this
is
a
strange
milksweet
stout
it
is
not
sweet
but
has
deeper
flavors
and
heavier
body
than
a
dry
stout
and
it
is
not
as
big
as
an
imperial
stout
a
good
stout
overall
but
not
really
to
my
liking
style
wise
very
dark
in
color
with
an
inch
of
fine
bubbled
tan
foam
plenty
of
lacing
down
the
sides
aroma
of
coffee
though
initially
strong
fades
to
subtle
taste
is
dry
to
bitter
the
taste
is
superior
to
the
smell
good
mouthfeel
with
pleasant
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
may
i
have
another
this
is
one
fine
stout
i
will
have
to
trade
for
more
bells
if
not
ill
have
to
visit
my
brother
in
michigan
sooner
than
expected
very
dark
in
the
glass
with
an
equally
dark
thin
head
that
does
some
respectable
lacing
down
the
sides
there
is
alot
going
on
in
the
nose
and
taste
nose
is
sweet
dark
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
simply
amazing
bitter
sweet
in
the
begining
that
turns
to
a
dark
roasted
chocolate
maltiness
and
well
balanced
hops
that
finishes
semidry
but
makes
me
salivate
for
more
very
smooth
and
silky
in
the
mouth
i
feel
like
there
is
more
there
but
my
brain
can
only
comprehend
so
much
highly
recommended
thanks
to
kryptic
for
the
trade
this
is
an
easy
drinker
as
far
as
bigger
stouts
go
i
quite
enjoyed
it
thanks
to
orrshow
for
splitting
the
bottle
i
love
a
good
milk
stout
and
kalamazoo
really
hit
the
spot
well
done
bells
now
would
you
kindly
sell
your
beer
in
my
home
state
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
beer
with
a
bit
of
head
that
is
off
white
the
head
has
a
nice
consistency
and
lasted
most
of
the
glass
there
is
a
dried
fruit
burnt
chocolate
smell
at
first
unfortunately
the
smell
didnt
translate
well
into
the
first
taste
first
the
roasted
chocolate
flavor
and
then
a
hoppy
bitter
aftertaste
overwhelms
by
mouth
as
the
beer
warmed
the
balance
between
slightly
sweet
and
bitter
hops
got
better
enjoy
this
after
dinner
before
but
not
with
dinner
it
is
just
too
good
to
pair
up
with
food
except
ice
cream
i
really
dug
this
stout
i
am
a
big
stout
fan
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
the
aroma
wafted
up
revealing
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
licorice
the
mouthfeel
was
silky
the
taste
was
right
there
some
roastiness
to
be
sure
but
a
nice
licorice
undertone
that
came
just
shy
of
being
too
far
forward
finally
the
hop
presence
was
nicely
aggressive
for
this
style
of
beer
keeping
it
from
being
too
sweet
if
you
want
a
stout
making
yours
a
kalamazoo
wouldnt
leave
you
crying
in
your
beer
this
beer
packs
a
flavor
wallop
but
remains
quite
drinkable
this
may
be
my
favorite
stout
that
is
not
a
ris
but
much
more
sessionable
nice
and
smooth
beer
will
seek
it
out
again
i
couldnt
stop
drinking
this
one
its
just
outside
of
the
range
of
a
session
beer
but
a
few
of
them
can
probably
be
handled
with
a
good
meal
the
licorice
adds
a
nice
touch
without
being
dominating
and
distracting
this
one
is
more
of
a
malt
lovers
beer
as
the
hops
dont
really
come
into
play
recommended
the
label
on
the
back
not
describing
the
beer
shouldve
been
a
good
clue
opened
cold
tasted
wasnt
much
but
it
is
a
stout
so
of
course
i
let
it
warm
up
at
cool
still
not
impressive
up
to
about
55
degrees
and
still
a
flat
slightly
watery
unimpressive
stout
it
poured
dark
giving
me
hope
head
was
flat
and
dissipated
quickly
had
light
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
and
hints
of
more
complex
flavors
but
it
never
got
there
the
flavors
didnt
meld
was
unveven
in
the
mouth
light
mouthfeel
neither
sweet
nor
bitter
would
not
recommend
it
to
a
serious
stout
drinker
d
i
loved
this
beer
bells
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
overall
a
decent
stout
i
wouldnt
have
penned
this
as
a
sweet
stout
although
i
guess
its
not
as
dry
or
bitter
as
most
regular
stouts
its
good
for
the
lover
of
roasted
malt
and
its
silky
mouthfeel
makes
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
not
my
favorite
but
certainly
worth
a
try
recommended
this
is
one
fine
stout
obtained
from
merchants
fine
wine
in
dearborn
poured
an
oily
shiny
black
and
sat
that
way
in
the
glass
with
deep
brown
edges
and
a
tan
head
that
settled
very
nicely
carbonated
by
fine
bubbles
the
smell
is
of
cocoa
freshly
ground
coffee
beans
cinammon
sticks
dark
wood
furniture
a
huge
roast
malt
burnt
coffee
taste
dark
chocolate
and
expresso
with
a
brazil
nut
astringency
making
itself
felt
from
time
to
time
the
finish
is
nutty
chocolate
a
lingering
chocobitter
aftertaste
quite
satisfying
all
around
sufficiently
complex
yet
highly
drinkable
if
i
had
access
id
try
always
to
have
some
of
this
on
hand
a
very
nicely
put
together
stout
that
succeeds
on
so
many
levels
edited
to
add
that
it
was
batch
8007
mouthfeel
surprisingly
crisp
for
a
sweet
stout
with
carbonation
that
is
not
quite
creamy
but
thats
really
all
to
criticize
with
this
brew
the
flavors
of
dark
roasted
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
form
the
backbone
with
various
spicy
and
hoppy
notes
dancing
and
fleeting
just
enough
dextrinous
sweetness
to
balance
the
bitters
but
this
is
a
remarkably
refreshing
dark
inky
black
awesome
beer
longgg
finish
incredibly
enjoyable
stout
another
great
effort
from
bells
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
but
could
be
more
so
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
it
was
available
d
very
im
not
a
big
fan
of
black
coffee
so
the
coffee
bean
aspect
of
some
stoutsporters
is
sometimes
a
turnoff
but
this
one
has
done
it
very
nicely
for
me
well
balanced
and
supremely
easy
to
quaff
d
not
a
bad
stout
at
all
too
bad
bells
isnt
available
around
here
this
beer
was
a
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
dessert
beverage
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
big
light
brown
head
that
dies
slow
and
laces
smells
roasty
chocolate
and
expresso
all
of
the
smells
are
in
the
taste
along
with
a
small
hop
bite
balanced
delicious
and
subtle
all
around
medium
in
the
mouth
and
smoooth
very
drinkable
on
its
own
session
or
as
a
treat
d
this
is
a
very
good
stout
not
a
surprise
that
bells
churned
out
another
good
brew
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
as
with
most
stouts
ill
be
stopping
with
one
and
saving
the
rest
to
be
enjoyed
later
looking
forward
to
trying
the
expedition
stout
d
i
give

a
bells
kalamazoo
stout
pours
an
opaque
dark
brownalmost
black
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
the
flavor
is
nice
and
rich
chocolate
notes
and
especially
coffe
notes
are
noticeable
the
coffee
especially
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
thicker
but
thats
a
minor
quibble
an
excellent
stout
bell
scores
in
a
major
way
with
this
stout
huge
flavors
with
a
slightly
sweet
background
to
complement
the
dark
malts
and
a
long
finish
that
leaves
a
good
aftertaste
smooth
coating
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
and
very
interesting
highly
recommended
drinkability
rich
and
full
flavored
this
is
one
you
could
drink
for
the
long
haul
with
its
lower
abv
its
money
i
might
drink
nothing
but
stout
if
bells
distributed
to
atlanta
despite
the
flavors
this
brew
is
quite
refreshing
light
and
very
drinkable
not
my
top
stout
but
a
very
good
one
would
definitely
revisit
this
if
given
the
chance
taste
was
equally
as
pleasing
tons
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
hit
the
tastebuds
first
with
a
little
bitter
kick
to
it
a
nice
touch
of
the
brewers
licorice
was
noticed
along
with
some
roasty
malt
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
a
little
tingle
in
the
throat
from
the
ample
carbonation
leaves
a
very
nice
but
soft
flavor
behind
a
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
leaves
you
wanting
more
very
good
drinkability
thanks
to
the
lower
abv
overall
a
very
tasty
stout
drinkability
very
smooth
and
tasty
that
meants
highly
drinkable
lower
alcohol
content
makes
this
a
beer
you
could
have
a

definitely
be
searching
this
out
again

like
roasted
malt
coffee
subtle
hops
and
licorcie
for
sure
well
blended
complex
and
sweet
smooth
silky
thick
and
velvety
goes
down
nice
ill
have
another
please
perfect
for
a
gloomy
rainy
afternoon
drinkability
simply
astounding
overall
a
tasty
brew
that
is
easy
drinking
yet
another
fine
brew
from
bells
im
thrilled
that
they
are
making
their
way
into
florida
eric
overall
this
is
a
very
well
made
stout
and
one
i
hope
to
run
into
again
now
i
can
hardly
wait
to
open
the
expedition
stout
d
a
mouthfull
of
flavor
with
a
nice
lingering
bitterness
not
quite
as
sweet
but
certainly
full
enough
for
my
liking
a
bit
strong
for
a
sessionable
stout
but
a
wellbalanced
one
that
id
love
to
have
again
thanks
to
crjmellor
for
sending
this
one
several
months
back
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
creamy
medium
colored
tan
head
that
leaves
lacing
all
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malt
with
some
cocoa
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
with
a
semisweet
and
bitter
finish
overall
this
is
a
solid
stout
that
is
recommended
drinkability
i
could
toss
back
a
few
of
these
without
any
trouble
whatsoever
nothing
offensive
at
all
d
a
full
bodied
stout
w
a
good
hop
profile
licorice
flavor
with
tinges
of
molasses
the
sweetness
is
balanced
by
the
herbal
flavors
it
is
not
one
i
would
drink
single
every
day
but
so
smooth
i
probably
could
get
a
bottle
and
try
your
hand
at
reviewing
this
recommended
probably
way
too
sophisticated
for
my
palette
since
i
was
thinking
about
my
next
beer
halfway
through
this
one
it
was
just
kicking
the
back
of
my
tongues
ass
and
i
wasnt
into
that
at
the
time
my
favorite
stout
hands
down
it
has
a
unique
bitterness
for
a
stout
that
smacks
your
tongue
instead
of
shaking
its
hand
the
initial
pow
is
balanced
with
malty
coffeey
chocolaty
desserty
tastes
it
smells
of
all
the
best
things
available
to
the
style
after
sitting
and
sipping
this
awhile
it
occurs
to
me
that
this
would
be
an
excellent
stout
for
those
new
to
the
style
superbly
balanced
straightforward
but
not
simpleminded
and
purely
delicious
also
bells
needs
to
put
their
stuff
it
bigger
bottles
it
always
disappears
to
quickly
another
fine
entry
by
this
excellent
brewery
something
seems
off
and
astingent
i
do
like
it
especially
the
way
the
licorice
plays
in
but
too
chalky
and
burnt
to
really
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
creamy
with
a
bit
of
natural
carbonation
very
smooth
and
dessertlike
throughout
original
4

pours
the
first
totally
black
beer
ive
ever
seen
with
a
solid
finger
of
tan
head
on
top
that
disappears
fairly
slowly
nose
is
strong
on
molasses
dried
fruit
caramel
and
maybe
some
chocolate
too
feel
is
solid
although
maybe
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
taste
is
excellent
as
well
all
over
the
place
up
front
is
some
sweet
chocolate
crazy
roasted
malts
and
then
some
nice
and
pointedly
sweet
flavors
of
raisins
and
brown
sugar
in
the
middle
roasted
malt
shows
up
again
a
little
more
often
as
the
beer
warms
ends
with
a
solid
slightly
hoppy
bitter
aftertaste
solid
aftertaste
though
which
sticks
around
with
a
nice
sweetbitter
mix
this
ones
outstanding
as
well
im
really
stunned
by
how
consistently
great
bells
offerings
are
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
possibly
topped
only
by
the
incredible
expedition
stout
overall
good
brew
i
like
some
of
bells
other
stouts
better
but
this
is
the
only
one
currently
available
in
florida
its
an
easy
drinking
stout
that
i
can
get
my
hands
on
which
scores
it
extra
points
it
is
complex
in
taste
and
i
love
the
added
smoke
in
there
there
is
no
easier
drinking
stout
around
bells
in
my
opinion
is
one
of
the
top
5
brewers
around
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
please
i
am
begging
you
bring
your
entire
line
to
the
sunshine
state
d
purely
subjective
its
not
for
everyone
but
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
drinkability
quite
nice
it
should
be
on
anyones
list
of
things
to
drink
before
they
die
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
roasted
malts
and
coffee
being
the
dominant
flavors
i
dont
really
notice
the
licorice
as
much
at
all
which
means
to
me
its
just
the
right
amount
enough
to
add
to
the
flavor
but
not
enough
for
me
to
refer
to
this
as
the
licorice
stout
fairly
heavily
bodied
though
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
theres
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
too
it
not
a
bad
thing
really
just
makes
me
want
to
drink
more
ill
have
to
slow
down
though
this
is
the
only
one
i
bought
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
pours
a
nice
oft
beige
head
and
leaves
tons
of
lacing
down
the
glass
tastes
better
as
it
warms
lots
of
chocolate
with
some
nice
hoppy
dryness
towards
the
back
of
the
tongue
nice
smelling
brew
possible
coffee
and
milk
shine
through
a
great
interpretation
of
a
milksweet
stout
and
very
comparable
to
st
petes
cream
stout
taste
is
very
heavily
of
roasted
malt
the
brewers
licorice
adds
a
lovely
subtle
dimension
especially
in
the
finish
dark
chocolate
coffee
black
pepper
and
a
light
buttery
sweetness
to
finish
very
well
executed
mpouthfeel
is
not
overcarbonated
with
a
full
body
and
a
bit
of
dryness
after
a
thick
bitter
finish
this
is
a
stupidly
drinkable
stout
not
overly
complex
to
me
but
thats
what
i
like
about
it
its
not
muddled
its
well
made
and
super
sessionable
what
more
can
you
ask
for
an
oustanding
stout
with
a
complex
flavour
profile
very
enjoyable
poured
a
complete
opaque
black
with
a
two
finger
dark
tan
head
that
dies
down
to
a
nice
lacing
stickiness
is
very
good
holds
on
all
the
way
through
smell
is
of
a
toffee
like
malt
with
a
toasted
nut
aroma
very
mild
hop
odor
as
well
that
tickles
the
nose
taste
is
so
sweet
and
creamy
with
hints
of
milk
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
aftertaste
is
a
hint
of
a
smokey
nut
character
with
peppery
spices
that
tingle
as
well
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
mild
but
suitable
carbonation
so
smooth
drinkability
is
there
for
sure
with
this
style
glad
i
picked
up
another
one
in
a
trade
bells
continues
to
amaze
me
bham
uk
d
it
very
high
because
it
is
creamy
but
not
acidic
like
some
other
stouts
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
damn
solid
beer
it
seems
that
everybody
including
myself
is
trying
to
reinvent
the
stout
and
this
beer
right
here
is
just
clean
simple
and
delicious
appearance
is
an
inky
black
with
a
decent
head
that
seems
to
materialize
once
the
beers
been
in
your
glass
for
10
seconds
already
aroma
is
very
chocolately
but
this
didnt
show
up
much
in
the
flavor
the
flavor
was
distinctly
smoky
which
i
was
a
bit
intrigued
by
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
good
definitely
recommended
i
like
other
stouts
better
but
this
is
good
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
and
try
their
other
offerings
its
not
that
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
it
was
tasty
and
satisfying
but
overall
its
quite
a
bit
unbalanced
in
my
opinion
and
feels
like
there
are
some
flavors
that
could
be
there
but
arent
being
let
shine
through
due
to
the
imbalances
i
kept
noticing
myself
thinking
i
was
about
to
taste
something
that
never
actually
came
still
though
not
too
bad
overall
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
bells
kalamazoo
stout
was
opaque
black
in
color
with
a
tan
head
the
head
had
good
retention
and
left
a
sheet
of
lace
behind
the
smell
was
nice
with
coffee
and
chocolate
aromas
the
taste
was
roasted
grain
dark
malts
and
chocolate
with
a
nice
balancing
bitterness
and
long
finish
it
was
full
bodied
and
creamy
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
this
is
definately
one
of
the
better
stouts
out
there
and
is
worth
seeking
out
a
unique
and
superbly
crafted
milk
stout
my
favorite
to
date
highly
recommended
the
drinkability
is
hindered
by
the
metallic
aftertaste
taste
is
burned
with
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
and
a
strong
maltbitter
there
is
also
a
good
hopbitterness
which
together
with
the
roasted
side
are
the
2
key
players
in
this
beer
the
burned
notes
could
have
been
a
little
more
pronounced
or
sharper
body
is
slightly
sweet
and
medium
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
impressive
american
stout
it
is
flavorful
and
potent
a
sipper
at
the
start
but
good
for
more
than
one
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
it
is
pretty
thick
but
for
a
stoutlovin
guy
thats
all
right
its
very
very
sweet
maybe
i
wouldnt
have
too
many
of
these
if
i
was
out
with
other
option
but
two
of
these
makes
me
smile
pretty
good
drinkability
the
6
5
abv
is
well
hidden
beneath
the
rest
of
whats
going
on
with
this
one
i
could
nurse
a
couple
more
watching
the
second
round
of
the
stanley
cup
playoffs
many
thanks

go
sabres
12
ounce
long
neck
bottle
but
with
a
different
label
than
shown
above
the
beer
has
a
very
dark
color
basically
black
with
just
a
hint
of
light
able
to
shine
through
when
held
to
the
light
it
has
a
thick
brown
head
great
stability
with
sheets
of
lace
an
excellent
looking
brew
beer
was
served
cold
so
had
to
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
so
all
of
the
aromas
and
flavors
came
through
roasted
malts
aroma
with
some
fruitiness
coffee
and
cocoa
tastes
slightly
bitter
roasted
coffee
dark
chocolate
all
the
flavors
you
want
in
a
sweet
stout
balanced
by
some
sweetness
in
the
end
full
bodied
creamy
smooth
with
just
enough
alcohol
warmth
very
enjoyable
solid
beer
worthy
of
its
praise
average
beer
i
am
definitely
unimpressed
their
expedition
stout
is
infinitely
better
a
tasty
stout
with
great
aroma
and
complexity
d
okay
i
might
have
again
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
a
good
stout
to
keep
around
not
too
extreme
on
any
front
but
with
enough
complexity
to
be
rewarding
the
take
i
would
get
this
again
i
have
to
for
more
fine
tuning
good
choice
d
very
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
slightly
filling
decent
kick
this
one
is
an
excellent
sipper
especially
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
with
the
flavor
of
an
ris
but
less
of
the
alcohol
punch
this
was
like
pouring
carbonated
oil
into
a
glass
it
was
black
with
a
beautiful
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
was
faint
of
malt
mostly
the
taste
is
malty
and
spicy
it
is
robust
but
not
overpowering
it
ends
with
a
faint
taste
of
licorice
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
carries
the
beer
quite
well
i
admit
that
i
am
happily
surprised
at
this
beer
brewed
with
licorice
and
find
it
quite
drinkable
pours
pitch
black
with
lots
of
lace
and
a
head
that
lasts
all
the
way
down
very
roasty
malty
dark
fruit
coffee
cocoa
aroma
flavor
is
the
same
but
much
more
intense
carbonation
is
spot
on
finish
is
actually
better
than
the
taste
gets
rid
of
the
dark
fruit
thing
not
into
that
so
much
solid
stout
character
poured
a
black
licorice
black
with
some
light
penetrating
the
beer
at
the
bottom
and
at
the
top
it
just
had
a
thin
and
tan
colored
head
of
foam
that
just
dissipated
away
in
a
matter
of
only
a
few
seconds
there
wasnt
much
of
it
to
dissipate
away
anyway
when
it
dissipated
away
it
left
behind
a
small
trace
of
mocha
rings
and
tan
colored
lace
around
the
glass
the
aroma
was
just
a
little
bit
this
and
a
little
bit
of
that
it
just
had
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
caramel
chocolate
molasses
and
a
little
bit
of
herbal
hops
to
finish
off
the
aroma
the
taste
was
a
little
different
it
had
a
dominate
element
and
that
was
the
dry
roasted
malts
after
that
came
the
bakers
chocolate
dab
of
sweet
molasses
a
touch
of
roasted
coffee
beans
and
the
slightest
hint
of
dry
roasted
herbal
hops
at
the
end
its
a
smooth
medium
bodied
beer
with
moderate
carbonation
and
with
a
simple
aftertaste
of
just
dry
roasted
malts
and
nothing
else
overall
its
just
an
above
average
decent
offering
from
bells
i
kinda
expected
more
from
a
beer
with
a
grizzled
dwight
d
eisenhower
on
the
label
solid
stout
one
ill
seek
out
again
overall
this
is
not
an
overpowering
stout
extremely
wellcrafted
and
balanced
the
espresso
flavor
lasts
for
a
while
and
is
quite
mellow
a
very
laid
back
stout
with
a
lasting
flavor
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
not
extremely
heavy
but
definitely
a
little
dry
allinall
one
of
damn
fine
beer
not
the
best
but
something
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
again
in
fact
i
may
pick
up
a
couple
more
just
to
share
them
with
friends
a
very
unique
and
wonderful
experience
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
a
deffinate
favorite
d
very
drinkable
for
a
sweet
stout
so
well
balanced
and
dry
in
the
finish
leaves
you
wanting
more
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
i
could
drink
these
all
day
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamier
and
in
my
opinion
better
than
the
mackeson
both
are
superbly
drinkable
and
extremely
tasty
well
done
d
this
stout
performed
the
balancing
of
sweetness
and
roasted
bitterness
quite
well
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
huge
brown
head
with
a
black
body
and
some
very
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
and
some
faint
chocolate
its
very
smooth
since
its
a
milk
stout
and
very
easy
going
down
carbonation
is
very
easy
also
and
its
sorda
between
thick
and
thin
side
i
cant
smell
any
of
the
smells
in
it
i
may
enjoy
this
more
as
i
drink
it
i
think
the
hype
hasnt
set
in
that
im
drinking
a
bells
kalamazoo
stout
all
in
all
its
a
damn
good
stout
pours
a
large
tan
head
and
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
dissapates
the
color
is
basically
black
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
coffee
and
figs
tastes
of
dark
roated
malt
and
coffee
with
a
slight
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
another
very
drinkable
quality
beer
from
bells
not
really
a
sweet
or
milk
stout
if
you
ask
me
certainly
isnt
sweet
bitter
flavors
abound
and
the
finish
is
bitter
borderline
astringent
drinkabilty
is
lower
due
to
the
bitterness
of
the
beer
overall
and
its
astringency
medium
mouthfeel
very
average
stout
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
large
creamy
thick
tan
head
that
stays
forever
the
color
is
opaque
and
murky
the
aroma
is
a
nice
roasted
chocolate
with
a
licorice
twist
the
taste
follows
suit
big
creamy
choclate
roasted
highlights
slight
astrigent
bite
once
the
beer
is
in
your
mouth
hop
bitterness
and
that
licorice
flavor
pulls
through
the
body
is
medium
and
oooh
so
creamy
smooth
a
great
brew
that
i
can
enjoy
a
couple
in
a
sitting
maybe
my
favorite
stout
overall
thanks

right
over
the
other

a
fine
stout
fine
stout
indeed
some
interesting
complexity
nice
roast
and
body
and
a
pleasant
kick
i
would
have
to
say
i
like
the
nose
on
the
beer
a
bit
better
than
the
taste
the
bite
at
the
end
was
just
a
little
strong
for
my
liking
in
a
sweet
stout
finally
able
to
taste
a
bells
stout
picked
this
one
up
at
brawleys
on
my
last
trip
poured
a
thick
deep
dark
black
with
a
big
creamy
brown
head
faded
from
the
initial
2
inches
to
a
12
inch
lace
that
stayed
till
the
bottom
of
the
glass
very
nice
light
brown
coating
left
down
the
sides
smell
was
very
sweet
first
hints
were
of
coffee
and
licorice
followed
by
sugary
sweetness
and
rootbeer
as
it
warmed
hints
of
rootbeer
or
cream
soda
were
apparent
and
suprisingly
pleasent
smells
were
not
too
strong
a
little
more
pronounced
and
it
would
have
been
perfect
taste
was
very
rich
and
creamy
with
a
soda
like
consistency
due
to
the
light
feel
and
high
carbonation
predominant
taste
was
coffee
and
caramel
again
with
hints
of
some
kind
of
sweet
cola
taste
only
complaint
on
this
was
it
came
off
a
bit
thin
other
than
that
this
was
a
fine
brew
just
a
bit
thin
but
a
good
session
beer
d
this
goes
down
like
water
very
refreshing
for
a
stout
bells
does
it
again
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
rendition
of
the
style
and
shoots
bells
further
up
the
charts
of
my
favorite
breweries
ill
be
looking
forward
to
changing
it
up
and
having
expedition
stout
later
tonight
i
drank
it
blind
and
after
read
the
label
and
went
oh
yeah
that
was
licorice
in
there
nice
job
drinkability
good
stuff
i
purchased
this
bottle
while
in
michigan
but
i
can
now
get
this
in
council
bluffs
iowa
as
with
most
of
the
bells
beers
ive
had
so
far
this
is
one
damn
fine
brew
just
had
this
on
tap
tonight
at
flying
saucer
and
reviewed
from
notes
poured
a
very
opaque
black
with
a
thin
darkish
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
and
left
almost
no
lacing
aroma
was
good
and
strong
abundant
chocolate
and
black
malt
this
beer
had
a
rich
complex
flavor
chocolate
molasses
and
just
a
hint
of
black
licorice
there
were
subtle
hops
present
as
well
but
you
could
tell
they
knew
there
job
was
just
to
balance
the
beer
had
a
decent
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
overall
this
is
a
great
stout
very
enjoyable
drinkability
if
it
wasnt
for
the
fact
that
it
is
above
6
0
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
day
a
great
beer
after
18
holes
or
after
a
hard
day
at
the
office
interestingly
flavorful
with
that
nice
dry
stout
bitter
finish
really
nice
brew
all
around
worth
bringing
a
sixer
home
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
quite
possibly
the
best
feeling
beer
ive
ever
had
in
my
mouth
a
full
heavy
creamy
body
is
what
i
expect
from
a
stout
and
here
my
expectations
are
surpassed
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
with
light
carbonation
this
beer
slides
down
easily
this
is
a
beer
ill
definitely
buy
again
and
in
addition
to
that
ill
be
sure
to
check
out
more
milk
stouts
as
this
is
my
first
it
just
beats
the
normal
dry
stout
if
you
ask
me
i
found
the
mouthfeel
smooth
but
a
tad
thin
this
a
stout
i
think
i
could
have
a
session
with
so
i
rate
the
drinkability
high
i
would
love
to
have
a
significant
supply
of
this
on
hand
to
input
in
my
everyday
drinking
cycle
thanks
for
this
one
johnnym2002
rigorously
poured
into
a
small
snifter
glass
to
stir
up
the
beautiful
thick
tan
head
about
two
fingers
worth
looks
black
almost
entirely
opaque
except
it
does
look
like
a
little
bit
of
light
can
creep
into
the
edges
to
make
a
dark
burgundy
produces
a
fantastic
aroma
of
dark
fruits
roasty
bitter
chocolate
light
hops
and
light
alcohol
mmm
smells
great
medium
to
medium
light
body
with
perfect
palate
smoothing
carbonation
creamy
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
flavors
hit
the
taste
buds
as
a
light
tanic
stringency
hits
the
roof
of
the
mouth
im
not
a
big
fan
of
that
tanic
flavor
but
this
one
is
quite
different
to
me
it
reminds
me
of
a
porter
more
than
a
stout
at
this
point
bu
i
digress
so
finally
to
end
the
trip
we
get
a
nice
dry
hop
bitterness
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
milk
stout
with
a
unique
body
and
mouthfeel
however
the
tanic
flavor
keeps
me
from
thinking
that
this
is
highly
drinkable
i
can
not
believe
that
people
in
indiana
of
all
places
can
enjoy
what
we
in
the
only
outpost
of
civilization
in
the
entire
midwest
are
forbidden
this
is
the
finest
stout
made
not
quite
as
black
as
i
would
prefer
but
if
you
dim
the
lights
you
will
not
notice
easily
the
most
drinkable
stout
that
i
have
enjoyed
and
perhaps
what
made
me
finally
appreciate
the
genre
give
your
guiness
to
a
small
child
and
awake
to
the
good
news
bells
beer
is
alive
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
its
been
quite
a
while
since
ive
come
across
a
stout
that
ive
enjoyed
this
much
it
just
all
seems
to
work
its
not
bombastic
its
not
over
the
top
its
not
overwhelming
just
a
great
sessionworthy
stout
after
my
heart
id
reach
for
this
again
and
again
if
it
were
available
locally
bells
is
fairly
new
to
my
area
and
ive
been
trying
as
many
of
their
brews
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
lately
i
noticed
that
they
pull
of
the
coffee
flavor
really
well
in
a
lot
of
their
stouts
in
any
case
like
most
of
their
beers
this
one
is
well
crafted
and
drinkable
recommended
this
beer
pours
a
nice
black
with
a
creamy
head
that
holds
nicely
and
laces
well
the
smell
is
sweet
with
a
small
roasted
characteristic
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
very
sweet
and
a
small
amount
of
roasted
and
chocolate
characteristics
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
as
expected
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
a
good
stout
i
was
expecting
the
liquorice
flavor
but
it
was
not
too
strong
found
this
one
at
a
local
store
that
has
some
pretty
hard
to
find
beers
at
least
in
my
area
pours
a
dark
near
pitch
black
decent
brown
head
but
nothing
too
special
batch
7767
smell
is
chocolate
with
some
fruit
undertones
and
a
hint
of
the
brewers
licorice
they
mention
on
the
bottle
taste
was
better
than
i
expected
after
the
initial
impression
i
received
the
milk
and
sweet
side
of
this
stout
come
through
especially
when
poured
in
a
pint
glass
goes
down
well
all
things
considered
overall
i
would
consider
this
one
to
count
on
8
49
6pack
this
is
a
very
creamy
stout
with
a
very
good
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
the
smell
is
of
toffee
and
cocoa
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
malt
has
a
sweet
roasted
coffee
flavor
reminescent
of
vanilla
hops
is
definetly
present
not
too
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
extreamly
creamy
and
chocolaty
reminding
my
of
nutella
i
would
rank
this
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
one
of
the
better
from
bells
one
beer
i
wish
i
would
have
been
drinking
for
many
years
now
the
brewers
licorice
used
dominates
the
taste
as
well
as
the
scent
as
the
coffee
and
roasted
flavors
again
help
carry
the
day
this
is
a
dry
stout
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
and
medium
body
that
could
use
a
slight
upgrade
in
the
thickness
department
the
flavor
has
many
textures
and
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
stout
with
a
lot
going
for
it
12
oz
bottle
brewed
with
brewers
licorice
batch
7715
packaged
11106
it
pours
into
the
chalice
quite
black
with
a
mediumbubbled
yellowkhaki
head
that
is
thin
yet
sustains
and
leaves
decent
lacing
it
smells
of
roastedchocolate
and
burnt
malts
with
dark
fruits
figs
plums
and
a
little
bit
of
a
lactic
character
the
flavor
is
roasted
and
charred
almost
acrid
with
chocolate
coffee
greenpiney
hops
a
medium
to
high
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
roasted
malts
and
licorice
that
makes
a
cameo
after
the
beer
warms
a
bit
the
body
is
medium
and
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
long
roastedcoffee
finish
seems
more
like
an
american
stout
than
a
milksweet
stout
but
regardless
it
is
big
robust
and
quite
tasty
bells
kalamazoo
stout
has
a
lot
of
wonderful
qualities
and
very
few
if
any
low
points
the
pour
is
thick
and
creamy
with
very
nice
lacing
and
a
coffee
house
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
zesty
without
bitterness
or
sour
each
sip
seems
to
have
a
life
all
its
own
and
remains
on
the
palate
for
a
while
i
am
rarely
disappointed
by
any
of
bells
offerings
and
this
is
positively
no
exception
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
winters
night
oelergud
black
color
and
a
firm
tan
head
with
excellent
retention
and
heavy
lacing
to
the
bottom
the
nose
is
primarily
nutty
coffee
and
roasted
nuts
a
lot
of
malt
activity
hearty
dark
roasted
espresso
roasted
and
charred
malts
dry
but
not
too
bitter
other
balanced
notes
of
some
sour
fruit
and
a
strong
hop
addition
that
doesnt
detract
from
the
flavor
buttery
caramel
notes
notes
develop
half
way
down
bringing
together
the
hop
and
malt
characters
the
mouth
is
chewy
with
a
nice
creamy
smoothness
the
finish
is
relatively
clean
with
slight
lingering
nutty
roasted
malt
notes
solid
brew
and
one
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
i
really
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
beer
id
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
and
i
could
easily
drink
bells
out
of
this
stuff
given
the
opportunity
taste
is
very
smooth
with
a
fine
blend
of
roasted
malts
followed
by
a
nice
bitterness
from
the
hops
this
is
a
very
fine
example
of
the
style
and
is
very
drinkable
very
satisfying
hits
the
spot
when
you
have
a
hankering
for
a
stout
and
thats
always
a
good
thing
another
great
stout
from
one
of
the
best
stout
brewers
in
the
world
its
amazing
how
many
stouts
bells
can
brew
yet
all
of
them
are
good
and
unique
recommended
good
easy
drinking
sweet
stout
from
bells
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
expected
this
is
a
drinkable
stout
which
probably
would
not
fill
you
up
as
quickly
as
others
as
far
as
the
taste
of
the
beer
itself
i
found
it
very
average
at
best
for
a
stout
had
a
fairly
bitter
finish
with
lingering
flavors
of
coffee
the
head
pours
a
nice
lacing
that
falls
thin
into
a
lacing
that
doesnt
stick
all
to
well
the
taste
is
a
little
too
bready
and
the
coffee
flavors
are
dominated
by
off
flavors
that
arent
great
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
very
smooth
overall
i
would
like
something
a
little
more
fresher
but
i
will
still
try
another
for
freshness
sakes
taste
does
have
a
burnt
quality
to
it
in
a
good
way
though
the
roasty
toasty
malts
so
strong
with
notes
of
coffee
espresso
chocolate
anise
maybe
and
unhoppily
bitter
hops
mouth
is
a
zinger
hefty
carbonation
prickling
the
tongue
yet
still
kind
of
smooth
this
seems
to
me
that
this
beer
is
to
stouts
as
mean
beastly
bastard
hopbombs
are
to
ipas
and
as
with
hop
bombs
i
like
it
dark
as
hell
nice
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
the
smell
is
a
roasty
ride
punctuated
with
fruity
notes
and
anisefennelesque
musings
the
taste
is
a
powerful
sweet
stout
with
plenty
of
coffee
roastedness
to
even
out
the
sweet
with
the
anise
flavors
noticeable
and
nice
without
being
to
ripe
the
body
is
a
little
thinner
than
most
stouts
but
it
fits
well
with
the
beer
it
is
a
pleasent
drinker
but
not
an
all
day
affair
pours
a
five
finger
brown
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
black
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
chocolate
nose
starts
with
a
roastedburnt
chocolate
flavor
some
sweetness
nice
stout
1
89
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
chalet
party
goshen
in
very
drinkable
has
enough
interestinf
flavors
to
keep
you
going
but
its
dry
enough
to
not
at
all
be
cloying
incredible
appearance
smell
and
taste
in
this
one
they
all
speak
of
creamy
smoothness
with
a
rich
coffee
taste
and
a
toasted
burnt
malt
flavor
i
am
incredibly
glad
that
this
was
made
available
in
my
area
and
i
recommend
it
to
all
who
enjoy
great
craft
beer
if
they
get
a
chance
to
taste
it
i
personally
recommend
drinking
this
slightly
colder
than
most
stouts
as
it
seems
to
enhance
the
smoothness
and
slightly
mellow
the
burnt
flavors
regardless
an
outstanding
beer
overall
a
delicious
milk
stout
very
smooth
despite
the
burnt
malts
very
sessionable
poured
into
tumbler
at
50
degrees
beer
had
a
nice
head
that
reeked
of
chocolate
and
smoked
nuts
the
tase
was
fantastic
and
was
also
rich
with
that
nice
malty
rich
coffeetoffee
but
not
sweet
chocolatey
yummy
taste
i
really
like
this
stout
and
will
certainly
purchase
again
drinkability
and
notes
i
could
picture
having
two
of
these
but
its
in
no
way
a
session
beer
regardless
its
too
much
of
a
pleasure
to
drink
to
take
away
points
because
of
this
well
the
reason
to
celebrate
the
arrival
of
bells
to
washington
d
c
is
this
kalamazoo
stout
top
notch
stuff
d
if
you
have
had
trouble
finding
a
good
stout
milksweet
stout
to
drink
this
is
the
one
to
start
with
to
get
into
the
type
of
brew
excellent
beer
to
have
after
a
small
meal
in
my
opinion
d
very
drinkable
excellent
example
of
the
style
still
a
very
solid
stout
from
a
solid
brewery
the
body
is
thick
and
creamy
not
too
dry
not
too
sweet
not
too
roasty
just
good
beer
very
drinkable
like
i
said
ive
had
mixed
results
with
this
beer
in
the
dozens
of
times
ive
tried
it
but
it
just
so
happens
that
the
bottle
i
decided
to
finally
review
is
the
best
it
has
ever
been
as
much
as
i
have
loved
this
particular
beer
i
have
much
more
consistent
enjoyability
with
the
porter
if
only
the
stout
were
consistently
this
good
sometimes
it
tastes
like
beef
jerky
i
found
this
to
be
drinkable
but
it
tasted
better
with
food
than
by
itself
perfectly
decent
stout
certainly
worth
trying
i
got
a
gal
in
kalamazoo
well
i
got
a
beer
named
kalamazoo
anyway
and
its
a
tasty
creamy
sassy
stout
everything
about
it
comes
across
as
crisp
refreshingly
and
nicely
drinkable
so
maybe
kalamazoo
is
a
state
of
mind
and
if
so
my
mind
is
now
a
happy
place
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
brew
coming
from
bells
ive
also
had
better
milk
stouts
not
bad
but
not
great
d
another
amazing
brew
from
bells
have
they
a
bad
beer
not
sure
they
do
very
drinkable
bordering
ons
session
like
smooth
and
silky
makes
this
offering
a
must
if
you
can
try
it
a
good
stomach
warmer
easy
going
coated
the
palate
well
perfect
level
of
carbonation
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
pound
away
constantly
since
it
just
wasnt
anything
special
to
me
batch
7571
via
trade
with
akorsak
i
did
not
even
know
i
was
recieving
this
beer
and
im
very
happy
to
have
tried
it
average
looking
stout
without
too
much
of
a
head
but
the
nose
really
stands
out
the
licorice
root
is
apparent
as
it
melts
in
with
the
sweet
malts
lactose
sweetness
and
chocolate
roastedness
hops
are
not
featured
as
per
the
style
but
the
depth
of
the
malts
keeps
things
exciting
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
dull
but
it
fits
the
style
just
fine
great
for
anytime
of
day
and
its
also
a
very
accessible
stout
for
the
uninitiated
recommended
cheers
marvelous
chewy
and
sweet
then
roasted
lingering
i
love
oh
how
i
love
a
beer
that
encourages
you
to
slow
down
well
done
and
highly
recommended
edit
just
read
some
other
reviews
and
i
dont
seem
to
be
the
only
one
who
has
found
the
smell
offputting
could
be
a
more
extensive
problem
very
nice
flavorful
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
the
pour
into
my
fullers
nonic
raises
a
sparse
dark
brown
colalike
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
into
just
a
slight
glass
ring
over
a
virtually
opaque
body
that
lets
just
a
little
light
through
at
the
edges
lacing
is
impressive
considering
the
complete
lack
of
head
but
still
pretty
sudsy
the
nose
is
very
much
filled
with
dark
chocolate
and
roast
with
definite
espresso
notes
pretty
straightforward
the
flavor
is
quite
bitter
but
loaded
with
roast
and
coffee
notes
with
some
very
dark
bready
tones
as
well
leaves
a
pleasant
lingering
bitterness
in
the
mouth
bits
of
piney
hoppiness
too
the
mouth
first
struck
me
as
being
incredibly
thick
but
on
second
thought
its
only
mildly
thick
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
quite
high
but
smooth
a
hefty
beer
but
i
now
know
i
wont
be
hunting
for
this
one
solid
creamy
mouthfeel
damn
tasty
and
damn
drinkable
this
is
a
session
beer
thatll
leave
you
feeling
nice
and
warm
overall
the
astringency
of
this
brew
hurt
the
taste
and
drinkability
scores
big
time
i
had
a
hard
time
isolating
the
characteristics
of
this
beer
during
my
tasting
experience
ill
probably
pick
up
one
more
six
pack
just
to
make
sure
im
not
missing
anything
looking
at
the
other
reviews
of
this
beer
i
must
be
missing
something
oh
well
cheers
the
kzoo
stout
when
poured
from
the
bottle
is
extremely
dark
pitch
black
medium
head
kzoo
smells
of
malts
mixed
with
coffee
as
stouts
go
kzoo
is
a
pretty
smooth
one
not
too
bitty
but
this
beer
is
no
slouch
has
a
hint
of
malts
mixed
with
coffee
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
great
adding
to
an
already
decent
line
of
bells
beers
the
drinkability
is
also
good
this
is
quite
a
nice
brew
prosit
mk
very
drinkable
smooth
delicious
and
nothing
here
that
slows
down
the
enjoyment
i
wouldnt
say
its
light
but
its
not
thick
at
all
the
drinkability
is
great
all
nighter
everyday
overall
a
very
comfortable
easy
drinking
flowing
tasty
stout
that
could
use
some
work
on
the
aroma
all
in
all
this
is
quite
the
stout
and
i
actually
prefer
this
slightly
over
its
also
excellent
big
brother
expedition
stout
this
is
about
as
balanced
a
sweet
stout
as
ive
yet
encountered
itd
be
a
stretch
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
but
as
a
regular
especially
in
the
winter
months
it
would
be
wonderful
wish
i
could
get
this
stuff
here
these
drink
great
after
dinner
bells
just
keeps
giving
me
more
and
more
reasons
to
be
happy
i
moved
to
the
midwest
this
may
be
my
50th
bottle
of
kalamazoo
stout
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
sat
down
to
review
it
formally
inky

almost

soft
looking

sugary

with
extra
shots

as
always
heres
to
the
next

glass
a
black
color
nice
carbonation
nice
creamy
tan

some
lacing
afterwards
scents
of

am
not
disappointed
d
very
good
stout
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
i
have
tried
not
to
strong
of
flavors
think
it
is
well
balanced
the
mouth
is
mediumbodied
and
considerably
complex
its
very
drinkable
and
slightly
sweet
yet
still
has
some
bite
on
the
finish
its
not
my
favorite
of
the
bells
stout
family
yet
it
still
a
damn
fine
brew
d
actually
not
too
shabby
the
mellow
taste
is
nice
and
that
little
bite
keeps
it
interesting
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
drink
a
great
flipping
beer
a
must
try
top
notch
baby
overall
an
excellent
stout

up
there

its
dark
almost
balck
color
and
its
dart
tan

i
smelled
and
tasted
sweet
of
coffee
and
dark
hops
its
mouthfeel
is
full
and
well
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
i
really
like

relaly
make
this
a
good
stout
on
a
cold
winter
day
near
a
fire
place
you
could
really
warm
up
with
a
few
of
these
d
i
drank
this
after

well
in
place
of
dinner
and
it
fared
very
well
for
a
coolweather
dessert
beer
i
drank
this
to
commemorate
the
1year
anniversary
of
my
jeep
running
out
of
excuses
cheers
notesdrinkability
this
is
one
fine
stout
richly
dark
in
appearance
with
a
subtle
underlying
sweetness
full
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
dark
roast
coffee
makes
for
a
great
combination
alcohol
never
shows
its
head
at
6
5
highly
drinkable
i
could
see
sitting
down
and
putting
these
back
all
night
my
first
beer
from
bells
and
im
very
impressed
definitely
a
must
buy
and
one
that
i
will
try
and
aquire
again
glad
i
have
10
more
left
highly
recommended
all
in
all
bells
kicks
major
beerass
this
is
a
tasty
stout
just
seems
kinda
low
on
the
creaminess
and
sweetness
factors
with
the
creaminess
for
me
being
an
especially
nice
characteristic
for
this
style
overall
kalamazoo
is
a
good
beer
heck
i
drank
a
six
and
enjoyed
the
flavorful
roasted
elements
and
the
small
hint
of
alcohol
it
left
on
my
tongue
the
beer
is
very
enjoyable
but
i
think
i
would
tire
from
the
roasted
bitterness
after
a
couple
of
these
its
a
nice
example
of
a
sweet
stout
355
ml
bottle

thanks
beerbeing
perfect
big

i
dont
think
it
could
be
any
more
black
great
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
nothing
atypical
with
respect
to
sweet
stouts
flavor
was
perfect
no
bite
or
alcohol
taste
very
very
smooth
this
got
even
better
as
it
warmed
up
i
wish
more
brewers
would
brew
this
type
of
stout
poured
this
beer
out
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
dark
as
night
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
slim
rim
with
good
lacing
the
smell
is
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
not
overly
strong
but
pleasing
the
taste
is
definitely
of
deep
roasted
malt
but
it
is
balanced
nicely
which
makes
for
a
drinkable
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
well
bodied
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
would
recommend
trying
it
poured
opaque
black
with
a
small
tan
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
chocolate
roated
malt
and
light
caramel
in
the
aroma
bakers
chocolate
light
smoke
roasted
and
toffee
malts
in
the
taste
this
is
a
solid
lower
gravity
stout
that
can
be
sessioned
as
opposed
to
the
expedition
pours
a
dark
black
liquid
with
a
light
browncream
color
head
smell
is
weak
but
some
roasted
like
smell
taste
is
a
sweet
coffee
with
a
somewhat
metallic
finish
mouthfeel
is
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
sweet
stout
smooth
with
almost
no
carbonation
drinkability
would
be
high
on
a
fall
or
winter
day
but
this
being
mid
summer
ill
limit
myself
to
two
tonight
an
incredibly
drinkable
brew
considering
its
richness
and
alcohol
content
the
bittering
hops
cleanse
the
sugars
from
this
big
bad
beer
its
ard
to
describe
something
this
black
but
its
topped
with
a
rather
thick
super
sticky
tan
head
that
lasts
for
a
long
time
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
barley
taste
is
not
as
dry
as
i
would
have
expected
given
the
dry
nose
its
dry
but
still
has
a
bit
of
sweetness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
nice
carbonation
its
a
slowdrinking
beer
but
not
because
of
the
alcohol
content
theres
a
lot
of
beer
in
this
beer
retains
a
good
head
of
foam
sweet
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
malt
in
the
nose
ahh
that
supreme
roast
flavor
takes
me
back
to
the
last
kalamazoo
stout
i
had
almost
a
year
ago
it
builds
up
on
the
palate
appropriately
bitter
with
a
hint
of
chicory
or
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
still
vibrant
and
packs
a
punch
after
112
years
in
the
cellar
an
excellent
stout
that
i
will
visit
again
after
visiting
with
some
of
his
brothers
rye
up
next
d
very
enjoyable
stout
very
good
flavor
another
awesome
beer
recieved
in
trade
with
nlmartin
dark
black
appearance
with
brown
head
creamy
on
top
and
fizzy
on
the
sides
diminishes
but
lasts
throughout
the
beer
strong
roasted
flavor
with
average
to
long
aftertaste
smooth
from
beginning
to
end
this
is
a
high
quality
very
drinkable
stout
and
my
choice
over
the
expedition
by
bells
which
has
too
much
of
an
alcohol
bite
for
my
taste
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
dark
brown
with
some
reddish
tints
when
held
up
to
the
light
theres
also
about
an
inch
creamy
tan
head
and
a
lot
of
lacing
remains
on
the
glass
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
semisweet
chocolate
caramel
and
some
coffee
it
tastes
like
dark
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
coffee
and
theres
a
good
roasted
flavor
too
the
start
is
a
little
bitter
then
the
sweetness
hits
and
then
finishes
bitter
again
with
a
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
good
body
to
it
the
kalamazoo
stout
is
a
very
good
beer
id
definitely
buy
more
of
this
in
the
future
pours
jet
black
nearly
opaque
except
for
thin
dark
mahogany
highlights
the
brown
sugar
colored
head
is
dense
and
creamy
and
reaches
one
and
a
half
fingers
in
hieght
shows
good
retention
and
the
epitome
of
spotty
lacing
roasted
barley
nose
with
coffee
notes
faint
black
patent
and
molasses
first
sip
is
sweet
with
dark
roasted
malts
and
blackstrap
some
dark
chocolate
and
bitter
black
patent
semidrying
aftertaste
a
tame
hop
bitterness
paired
with
coffee
and
chocolate
lowmedium
carbonation
with
a
full
body
this
is
less
dry
than
expected
and
more
syrupy
which
i
found
quite
agreeable
finish
is
akin
to
the
aftertaste
with
plenty
of
complex
residual
sweetness
balancing
the
roasted
flavor
and
mild
hop
bitterness
the
drinkability
would
score
better
as
an
export
stout
but
will
please
fans
of
russian
imperial
stout
an
excellent
bargain
at
78
a
sixpack
medium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
very
easy
drinking
despite
the
bitterness
very
smooth
and
balanced
drinkability
is
good
it
feels
like
a
big
beer
even
though
it
comes
in
at
6
5
so
the
lower
alcohol
makes
it
more
drinkable
but
the
mouthfeel
lowers
it
some
the
highly
charred
flavour
lingers
long
after
finishing
the
glass
which
also
serves
to
lower
the
drinkability
overall
its
ok
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
little
thick
to
have
more
than
just
a
couple
though
a
good
sipping
beer
d
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
finish
this
is
a
delicious
drinkable
meal
in
a
bottle
poured
a
deep
brown
with
a
thick
head
the
smell
score
is
low
just
due
to
a
soured
smell
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
oatmeal
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
this
is
a
heavy
bodied
beer
very
filling
a
meal
in
a
bottle
a
good
beer
for
the
style
drinkability
not
too
bad
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
had
like
i
said
it
could
be
alittle
over
powering
if
your
drink
a
few
in
a
short
period
of
time
but
all
in
all
a
very
nice
stout
i
have
got
to
get
me
some
more
of
this
i
mean
this
is
great
the
malt
magicians
at
bells
have
done
another
magnificent
job
drinkability
glad
my
parents
grabbed
me
2
bottles
when
they
were
in
michigan
sadly
i
cant
find
this
stuff
locally
but
man
is
it
good
it
would
be
a
regular
in
my
mixed
6
packs
if
i
could
find
it
locally
thanks
to
thefatkid13
for
the
trade
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
garnet
highlights
topped
by
an
inch
of
creamy
brown
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
aroma
of
coffee
grounds
dark
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
some
fruity
hops
palate
is
rich
sweet
malt
milk
sugar
dark
chocolate
and
just
a
touch
of
bittering
from
the
hops
body
is
rich
and
velvety
damn
near
perfect
an
excellent
milk
stout
and
one
that
i
wish
id
asked
for
more
of
in
my
trade
pours
out
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
with
very
good
retention
smell
is
very
complex
reminds
me
of
dark
lord
full
of
coffee
chocolate
and
different
dark
fruits
very
very
good
taste
is
awesome
as
well
starts
out
deceiving
but
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
hits
you
with
an
onslaught
of
taste
beginning
is
green
then
roasty
changing
quickly
into
cherries
plums
other
dark
fruits
then
adds
some
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
to
finish
it
off
if
it
didnt
start
off
a
little
weak
with
the
green
flavor
it
would
be
an
easy
5
for
taste
medium
carbonation
medium
to
full
bodied
slick
on
the
tongue
if
the
very
beginning
of
the
taste
was
eliminated
this
would
just
be
beyond
a
great
beer
the
green
flavor
isnt
bad
but
doesnt
seem
to
fit
with
the
rest
of
this
beer
seriously
get
this
if
you
see
it
highly
recommended
oh
and
criticize
if
you
want
this
reminds
me
of
a
baby
dark
lord
i
love
it
this
beer
looks
great
its
dark
as
crude
oil
just
barely
can
see
a
hint
of
red
and
brown
around
edges
the
head
is
a
centimeter
or
so
tall
but
is
a
nice
carameltoffee
color
and
comes
back
quickly
if
you
swirl
your
glass
i
really
liked
the
head
of
this
beer
the
smell
is
very
roasted
but
sweet
with
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
but
there
are
clear
scents
of
dark
tart
fruit
as
well
there
are
a
lot
of
dark
tart
fruit
flavors
in
the
beer
as
well
cherry
and
plum
but
there
is
alway
a
strong
noticeable
roasted
flavor
that
is
bitter
but
not
too
this
should
be
a
really
chewy
beer
its
so
sweet
and
thick
but
there
is
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
as
well
that
i
thought
gave
this
beer
a
great
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
this
is
a
pretty
heavy
beer
average
drinkability
for
a
good
stout
bells
just
plain
knows
how
to
make
stouts
medium
feel
with
a
lowmedium
carbonation
sugary
coffee
roasted
bitterness
and
alcohol
dominate
the
flavors
finish
is
bitter
coffee
and
a
touch
of
hoppiness
lighter
in
feel
than
many
other
stouts
but
with
a
robust
flavor
close
to
black
with
deep
brown
hues
small
brown
head
settles
to
a
quarter
inch
smokey
as
a

chimney
after
a
hard

creosote

roasted

coffee
roasted
nuts
taste
is
dominated
by
huge
smoky
roastedness
slightly
sweet
with
a
thick
rich
body
low
carbonation
leads
to
easy
drinking
i
remember
it
being
much
better
on
tap
overall
i
dont
know
if
this
is
one
i
could
sit
and
drink
all
night
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
wellrounded
blanced
brews
ive
had
recently
i
could
easily
drink
another
bottle
drinkability
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ever
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
at
this
one
drinkability
this
goes
down
great
and
is
excellent
rich
and
hearty
and
satisfying
i
could
session
this
any
time
but
it
may
be
too
hearty
for
some
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
medium
tan
pillowy
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
lingering
chunks
lots
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
aroma
is
fairly
typical
for
a
stout
with
the
usual
roasted
malt
characteristics
coffee
chocolate
caramel
and
very
light
smoke
also
some
moderate
yeast
and
dark
fruit
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
at
first
with
the
roasted
malts
again
taking
centerstage
on
the
finish
it
turns
lightly
bit
but
theres
a
sourness
in
the
there
as
well
that
i
wasnt
expecting
and
didnt
really
enjoy
it
has
a
mediumfull
body
creamy
texture
and
soft
carbonation
not
bad
but
nothing
impressive
especially
coming
from
bells
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
from
the
bottle
and
theres
little
to
no
difference
this
beer
was
pitch
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
it
smelled
heavily
of
roasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
back
ground
taste
is
similar
with
a
very
dry
bitter
bite
to
it
appears
to
have
a
very
clean
yeast
strain
and
the
malts
almost
taste
like
youre
chewing
on
the
grains
i
found
it
nice
and
interesting
at
first
but
the
dryness
got
to
me
after
a
couple
bottles
drinkability
i
am
glad
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
this
is
an
excellent
beer
as
far
as
the
smokier
stouts
go
this
ones
top
notch
its
charred
but
still
smooth
and
clean
with
a
superb
silky
mouth
feel
poured
from
a
12ozer
into
a
standard
pint
glass
appears
almost
opaque
black
with
a
massive
chocoatecolored
head
nose
is
sweet
malt
oatmeal
and
a
bit
of
bakers
chocolate
palate
is
of
roasted
malt
oats
nuts
and
espresso
very
rich
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
light
carbonation
finishes
slightly
drier
than
i
would
have
thought
for
the
style
its
labeled
under
but
thats
not
a
complaint
good
hop
bitterness
lingers
here
this
is
a
very
good
stout
though
i
would
hesitate
to
call
it
a
milk
stout
really
topnotch
as
is
most
of
what
bells
offers
may
i
have
another
smooth
across
the
tongue
lightly
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
leaning
to
the
full
side
though
i
expected
a
chewier
brew
a
nice
alcoholinfused
oak
smoke
aftertaste
this
is
a
really
good
beer
it
went
great
with
the
homemade
chocolate
chip
cookies
i
finished
it
off
with
d
im
hoping
i
can
get
some
of
this
fresh
someday
i
bet
it
is
a
million
times
better
pours
a
strong
black
coffee
color
with
a
medium
tan
cap
with
orange
hues
a
one
finger
cap
quickly
dissipates
to
lacings
on
top
aroma
is
chocoloate
coffee
orange
and
fusal
hops
flavor
is
maltose
malt
toffee
chocolate
coffee
orange
and
roasted
barley
mild
citrus
and
fusal
hops
in
background
very
good
beer
with
lots
of
toasty
roasted
barley
good
blend
of
sweetness
hops
and
burnt
notes
medium
carbonation
and
medium
body
this
one
is
pretty
good
the
roasted
malt
and
slightly
overcarbonated
body
makes
it
a
bit
uneasy
to
swallow
easily
but
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
great
characteristics
found
in
this
brew
i
could
drink
this
stout
all
night
long
i
didnt
find
it
tough
to
drink
after
the
first
half
of
the
glass
as
some
sweetmilk
stouts
are
very
impressive
all
around
d
very
nice
stout
very
nice
a
lower
alcohol
content
allows
this
beer
to
be
enjoyable
and
not
over
the
top
another
good
stout
from
bells
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
for
being
a
darker
beer
ive
drank
a
6pack
of
this
on
a
few
occasions
with
out
a
problem
or
regret
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
beer
pours
a
very
dark
deep
brown
color
nearing
black
not
much
head
or
lacing
smells
of
yeast
and
malty
sweetness
taste
is
very
good
bready
with
subtle
fruit
tones
and
a
hop
profile
that
is
perfect
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
such
a
smooth
beer
going
down
medium
and
nice
im
thinking
this
must
be
a
standard
thing
with
bells
stouts
expedition
is
the
only
other
stout
i
can
recall
feeling
this
good
in
my
mouth
drinkability
is
also
very
good
too
bad
i
cant
get
it
in
california
overall
ok
the
smell
seems
like
the
odd
man
out
for
this
beer
everything
else
is
so
perfect
that
the
aroma
pales
in
comparison
even
at
that
the
aroma
is
still
good
all
i
can
say
is
if
you
dont
drink
this
beer
ill
pick
up
the
slack
d
refreshing
stout
with
a
lower
abv
which
is
not
noticeable
could
definitely
be
a
fallback
beer
if
i
wanted
something
familiar
and
heavy
a
nice
and
solid
beer
im
imagining
that
more
complexity
may
show
up
on
cask
but
im
not
sure
if
ill
ever
experience
that
two
fingered
brown
sugar
headover
a
black
brew
sharp
espresso
dark
bittersweet
chocolate
aroma
double
crack
roasted
coffee
roasted
barley
and
balanced
hop
bitterness
in
flavor
very
strong
chocolate
flavor
full
bodied
viscous
mouthfeel
finishes
w
a
lingering
enjoyable
hop
and
roasted
unmalted
barley
bitterness
almost
an
imperial
stout
put
this
together
with
my
first
beer
at
bells
ecclectic
cafe
and
i
was
in
heaven
bells
stouts
rock
bottom
line
this
is
quite
the
different
stout
and
one
i
favour
i
recommend
it
drinkability
is
high
a
very
pleasant
beer
overall
a
little
expensive
in
my
opinion
nice
black
color
with
a
big
foamy
dark
tan
head
a
fairly
heavy
pour
created
huge
lumpy
head
the
head
falls
to
a
fairly
thick
film
that
leaves
some
nice
clumpy
lacing
hints
of
expresso
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
smell
isnt
as
strong
as
i
expected
taste
does
come
through
with
more
punch
than
the
smell
again
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
slight
bitter
chocolate
aftertaste
but
very
minimal
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
almost
a
milk
like
smoothness
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
world
class
but
certainly
very
good
d
a
solid
easy
drinking
stout
nothing
jumps
out
and
grabs
you
about
this
beer
but
there
are
not
really
any
flaws
either
a
great
session
beer
to
have
on
hand
when
you
are
looking
for
a
nice
stout
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
a
very
high
quality
milk
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thick
but
nothing
you
would
not
expect
from
a
milk
stout
fills
the
mouth
and
coats
the
inside
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
very
nice
tan
head
sits
on
top
of
a
near
black
body
leaving
fair
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
dark
coffee
and
roasted
malts
dominate
the
nose
acrid
and
astringent
dark
malts
dominate
the
initial
swallow
i
cant
find
any
lacticmilk
sweetness
full
bodied
and
somewhat
rich
but
i
cant
get
around
the
roasted
malt
that
sticks
around
to
the
end
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
rank
up
near
the
top
end
either
poured
jet
black
with
a
beautiful
thick
brown
1in
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
isnt
too
potent
but
whats
there
is
nice
subtle
chococlate
with
mild
roasted
malts
when
i
take
the
first
sip
what
immediatley
comes
to
mind
is
frozen
coffee
drink
maybe
a
coolata
or
something
nice
and
sweet
with
a
nice
balance
of
a
little
bit
of
hops
along
with
the
malts
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thicker
than
medium
body
drinkablility
is
high
as
this
one
is
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
solid
review
400
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
might
be
a
bit
too
much
for
some
but
i
like
it
and
it
is
a
sweet
stout
afterall
that
being
said
the
kzoo
stout
is
very
well
balanced
and
has
an
exceptional
amount
of
complexity
this
is
a
mainstay
around
our
house
black
beer
with
brown
edges
and
a
dark
tan
stand
of
head
composed
of
fine
bubbles
plenty
of
thick
lace
rich
malty
roasted
aroma
with
some
coffee
and
licorice
character
moderate
bitterness
that
seems
to
be
from
both
hops
and
dark
grains
plays
nicely
with
the
roasty
malt
sweetness
that
lingers
into
the
finish
theres
some
chocolate
as
well
as
leafy
hops
that
contribute
a
bit
of
citrus
light
wellintegrated
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
produce
a
silky
creamy
texture
a
bit
drying
in
the
finish
an
excellent
beer
with
a
big
roasty
flavour
ill
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
was
impressed
with
the
look
of
this
beer
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
1in
caramel
colored

head
is

exceedingly
dry
roasted

lick
smackingly
dry
smooth
slightly
oily
again
so
dry
as
to
be
almost
tart
a
very
drinkable
stout
but
not
overwhelming
from
a
batch
in
the
6700s
which
would
put
it
around
a
year
old
da
wonderful
stout
i
d
have
maybe
one
more
due
to
the
thickness

a

from

as

of
ss

the

id

printed
on
the
reverse
lable
indicates
a
bottling
date
of
not
found
in

pours
nearly
black
with
a
smallish
tan
head
the
smell
was
not
very
pronounced
mainly
bitter
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
however
was
quite
good
starting
with
sharp
roasted
coffee
flavors
and
decent
herbal
hops
then
with
sweeter
chocolatetoffee
notes
finishing
with
some
more
bitter
hop
somewhat
complex
and
decently
rich
mouthfeel
is
very
well
balanced
with
good
carbonation
and
very
slightly
oily
finish
high
drinkabiliy
and
decent
value
with
that
being
said
you
could
put
this
up
against
the
brooklyn
chocolate
stout
or
the
rogues
and
it
would
hold
its
own
if
you
are
a
stout
lover
then
please
give
this
a
try
just
dont
expect
greatness
medium
to
full
bodied
could
throw
back
a
couple
not
bad
not
groundbreaking
but
pretty
good
on
tap
strong
musty
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavors
are
quite
robust
for
a
single
stout
too
many
stouts
fall
on
the
thin
side
and
the
rest
of
the
brew
falls
apart
but
this
one
is
thick
and
creamy
enough
to
help
the
rest
of
it
out
the
little
brother
to
expedition
this
brew
is
very
rich
and
flavorful
and
a
musttry
if
you
havent
been
able
to
sample
it
yet
overall
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
less
my
taste
description
does
it
justice
this
beer
is
not
especially
complex
its
no
imperial
stout
but
the
balance
of
roast
chocolate
and
woody
flavors
is
sublime
expedition
may
be
the
showpiece
of
bells
stouts
but
this
ones
definitely
the
bread
and
butter
i
could
drink
kalamazoo
stout
all
night
long
a
pretty
good
stout
rich
creamy
and
robust
an
exceptional
sipping
stout

but
to
me
more
along
the
lines
of
an
export
stout
versus
milk
the
beer
is
smooth
with
a
mild
body
very
nice
drinkability
with
a
easy
finish
the
acidic
aftertaste
keeps
the
astringency
down
but
still
lets
it
come
out
overall
a
great
stout
but
would
like
a
bit
cleaner
fermentation
drinkability
even
a
stort
that
reimnds
of
motor
oil
deserves
to
take
another
glass
to
the
lips
overall
a
nice
stout
somewhat
sweet
but
not
cloying
with
a
big
roasted
chocolate
flavor
one
that
ill
pick
up
again
bells
never
fails
to
impress
initial
mouth
feel
is
full
but
finishes
more
thin
highly
drinkable
the
standard
bells
stout
good
and
easy
to
find
in
michigan
chocolatey
in
taste
and
a
bit
chalky
on
the
mouthfeel
excellent
flavor
dry
and
smooth
but
seemingly
a
tad
thin
still
the
roasted
malty
chocolatey
flavor
wins
over
as
it
warms
the
coffee
moves
to
the
forefront
the
lacing
is
still
marking
the
starting
line
while
i
hit
the
finish
line
still
an
amazing
everyday
stout
that
is
easy
to
forget
in
the
midwest
with
so
many
other
good
bells
stouts
nice
stout
for
sipping
but
the
sourness
might
be
a
bit
too
much
after
a
while
first
bells
stout
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
on
tap
at
klingers
in
hanover
pa
served
in
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
absolutely
pitch
black
no
light
at
all
coming
through
a
finger
of
beige
head
nice
retention
and
solid
lacing
smell
isnt
as
strong
as
expected
a
light
roasted
malt
and
some
slight
espresso
taste
is
excellent
a
nice
roasted
malt
cocoa
smooth
milk
chocolate
and
a
nice
finish
with
some
slight
hops
and
a
bitter
lingering
roast
excellent
balance
between
the
sweet
lactose
and
the
bitter
roast
despite
the
thick
chewey
mouthfeel
i
found
myself
downing
this
rather
quickly
this
is
an
amazing
stout
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
more
often
mouthfeel
is
big
and
viscous
it
fills
the
mouth
and
definetly
has
a
nice
chewiness
however
at
the
same
time
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
i
find
my
glass
emptying
rather
quickly
a
great
stout
overall
from
a
brewery
that
seems
to
never
miss
with
the
style
put
the
words
bells
and
stout
together
on
a
brown
bottle
and
youll
undoubtedly
see
a
smile
on
my
face
well
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
dark
brown
in
color
with
mahogany
highlights
this
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
and
was
topped
by
a
bubbly
tan
colored
head
that
leaves
an
intricate
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
it
settles
the
aroma
is
more
subtle
than
the
expedition
stout
hints
of
roast
malt
espresso
and
just
a
touch
of
chocolate
come
across
immediately
just
a
touch
of
citrus
on
the
back
end
the
flavor
is
again
more
subtle
than
the
expedition
layers
of
chocolate
espresso
just
a
bit
of
walnut
caramel
in
the
finish
nice
touch
of
bitterness
lingers
as
i
contemplate
the
rich
full
mouth
feel
nice
beer
much
more
approachable
than
the
expedition
heavy
dark
roasted
coffee
flavor
reminds
me
of
starbucks
mochachip
ice
cream
a
little
dextrinous
and
moderately
chewy
while
it
has
an
initial
hit
of
sourness
almost
like
an
oldschool
porter
it
finishes
smooth
with
a
kick
of
roasted
malt
bitterness
somewhat
out
of
balance
but
still
quite
good
and
quite
intriguing
overall
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
i
am
just
not
impressed
the
sweetness
is
not
balanced
by
any
other
taste
factors

chocolate
in
the

taste
is
very
creamylike
with
a
nice
dose
of
chocolate
not
a
whole
lot
of

but
i
think
this
is
for
the
best
very
well
balance
beer
a
fairly
straightforward
beer
coffee
flavors
are
most
predominant
so
if
thats
what
you
look
for
in
a
sweet
stout
this
is
a
great
one
otherwise
this
is
solid

offering
nearly
pitch
black

some
brown
around
the
edges
medium

was
small
and
fleeting
as

chocolate
and
some
caramel
maltiness
the
slightest
bit
of
charring
in
the
background
this
has
a
very
pleasing
flavor
which
isnt
overdone
at
all
again
slightly
sweet
to
start
some
raisin
plum
fruitiness
this
fades
to
a
sweet
chocolate
toffee
flavor
and
finishes
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
from
some
faintly
floral
hops
and
dark
roasted
malts
nice
and
crisp
mouthfeel
makes
this
one
refreshing
still
has
an
oilyness
to
it
as
well
drinkability
is
superb
a
very
well
crafted
beer
drinkability
incredible
this
one
is
black
and
i
mean
black
no
light
or
any
other
color
shines
through
when
held
up
to
the
light
there
is
a
somewhat
small
yet
brilliant
dark
brown
colored
head
maybe
the
darkest
colored
foam
ive
seen
on
a
beer
the
smells
are
strong
of
sweet
roasted
malts
and
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
quite
sweet
scents
the
taste
is
gordgeous
quite
possibly
the
perfect
balance
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
with
a
nearly
citrusysweet
finish
wonderful
tasting
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
nice
the
carbonation
is
present
which
i
was
hoping
for
the
drinkability
is
nice
as
well
its
a
sipper
but
you
shouldnt
get
bored
with
it
definitly
worth
a
try
if
you
find
it
on
the
shelf
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
beer
is
not
the
best
the
flavor
isnt
engaging
enough
for
me
to
want
another
and
i
have
a
feeling
that
the
thickness
of
this
beer
would
get
to
me
after
a
while
starring
bells
kalamazoo
stout
as
blacula
big
rocky
determined
chocolatecolored
headabout
as
good
as
a
stout
can
look
smells
fairly
caramelly
and
lactosesweet
but
not
really
strongly
of
anything
tastes
strongly
of
toffee
a
roasted
buttery
sweetness
with
a
little
hint
of
rotten
prunes
and
raisins
underneath
yeah
diacetylroastedcarameltoffee
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
creamy
overall
easy
to
drink
but
not
especially
interesting
the
java
stout
is
better
again
the
roasted
notes
are
strong
in
the
taste
the
cocoa
is
there
again
but
coffee
comes
through
with
a
balancing
dose
of
dry
hops
solid
i
would
like
a
fuller
mouth
but
the
drinkability
doesnt
suffer
another
great
beer
from
the
folks
at
kalamazoo
brewing
company
this
was
my
first
second
stout
and
i
think
that
it
is
delicious
this
will
definitely
be
in
my
fridge
during
the
winter
months
keep
up
the
great
work
kalamazoo
brewing
pours
black
in
color
with
creamy
brown
head
that
gave
way
to
good
amount
of
lacing
intensive
roasted
malt
along
with
carmael
chocolate
coffee
are
the
dominant
flavors
somewhat
bitter
which
i
liked
if
you
like
stouts
you
will
not
find
to
many
any
better
than
this
one
this
is
one
great
stout
that
i
will
not
get
the
chance
to
sample
much
since
im
down
here
in
north
carolina
great
mix
of
chocolate
caramel
and
coffee
smell
and
taste
beautiful
head
and
lacing
smooth
and
milkyeasy
to
finish
and
ask
for
more
not
too
overwhelming
could
really
enjoy
in
the
winter
months
a
smoky
flavor
is
complemented
by
the
malts
which
came
through
as
the
dominant
flavor
there
was
also
a
sweet
aftertaste
left
in
my
mouth
so
i
would
assume
this
beer
is
a
sweet
stout
mouthfeel
for
this
beer
can
be
described
as
confident
not
brash
or
cocky
nor
weak
or
feeble
the
beer
lets
you
know
it
is
there
in
your
mouth
but
it
doesnt
overwhelm
your
senses
as
the
i
drank
more
of
the
beer
and
the
temperature
increased
the
flavors
seemed
to
become
stronger
and
bolder
as
one
would
expect
this
however
did
not
affect
the
drinkability
at
all
as
it
went
down
smooth
for
the
entire
twelve
ounces
i
would
reccomend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
regional
stout
in
the
area
overall
tastes
wonderful
and
the
aroma
is
to
die
for
very
balanced
milk
stout
but
the
roasted
flavors
and
sweet
malts
take
charge
many
thanks
to
skyhand
for
this
brew
wow
this
one
is
really
amazing
poured
out
to
a
really
nice
black
color
really
it
was
totally
black
couldnt
see
through
it
perfect
carbonation
and
an
nice
2
inch
head
i
poured
it
with
the
intent
of
creating
a
large
head
some
minor
lace
was
noted
around
the
glass
aromas
of
sweet
cream
and
earth
are
present
albeit
very
light
the
flavor
is
phenominal
smooth
cocoa
and
chocolate
caramel
coffee
bean
raw
sugar
and
an
earthy
roasted
taste
very
well
balanced
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
but
this
brew
went
down
with
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
making
the
glass
quite
hard
to
put
down
finished
like
on
a
roasted
nutty
note
this
is
a
top
beer
for
me
i
just
wish
i
had
bought
more
highly
recommended
for
all
bas
12
oz
bottle
enjoyed
at
waldo
pizza
in
kcmo
espresso
dark
chocolate
and
some
hop
aroma
pitch
black
with
a
brown
head
some
lace
looks
pretty
think
very
sweet
reminds
me
of
like
chewing
on
a
coffee
bean
bitter
enough
to
balance
sweetness
quite
full
bodied
an
silky
smooth
taste
is
smooth
and
creamy
no
mouthfeel
is
creamy
nevertheless
you
get
this
nice
roastybitterness
in
the
aftertaste
and
very
much
a
bit
of
that
coffeechocolate
lingering
tastes
upfront
are
a
bit
of
sourness
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
this
really
nice
creaminess
almost
like
a
round
feeling
mouthfeel
is
good
bonus
points
for
spilling
over
onto
taste
although
this
is
a
great
beer
im
not
sure
i
could
session
on
this
one
another
excellent
bells
overall
pours
pitch
black
with
a
very
small
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
small
ring
of
foam
around
the
edges
that
sticks
to
the
glass
smells
fantastic
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
fruit
taste
is
dominated
by
the
roasted
malt
there
are
definitely
some
chocolate
molasses
espresso
flavors
lurking
here
too
they
arent
quite
as
noticable
as
the
wonderful
aroma
would
suggest
but
they
do
emerge
as
the
brew
warms
very
tastey
but
maybe
slightly
off
balance
not
quite
as
delicious
as
its
aroma
would
suggest
its
medium
to
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
definitely
not
a
chore
to
drink
because
of
the
ridiculously
hot
and
humid
weather
here
lately
ive
been
in
the
mood
for
lighter
bodied
beers
but
the
temps
have
cooled
down
for
a
few
days
and
i
need
to
experience
a
good
solid
stout
this
one
pours
as
black
as
midnight
with
a
small
dark
head
but
poor
retention
nice
roasted
nut
aroma
slight
hops
can
be
detected
upon
tasting
but
nothing
too
hoppy
this
was
all
about
the
malts
black
coffee
overwhelmed
the
taste
bitter
aftertaste
hurt
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
as
well
as
the
drinkability
another
impressive
stout
by
bells
this
has
a
similar
flavor
aromatic
and
visual
profile
as
the
expedition
stoutjust
kicked
down
a
notch
this
is
impressive
with
its
balance
of
roasted
chocolate
caramel
and
barley
malts
hopped
only
for
balance
slight
tartness
creamy
with
sight
bittering
no
astringency
or
graininess
present
alcohol
but
never
dominates
finishes
slightly
bitter
with
nice
linger
period
all
in
all
an
okay
stout
but
not
quite
what
i
had
expected
while
it
had
some
sweet
components
and
a
moderately
smooth
body
i
was
surprised
to
read
this
is
a
milk
stout
a
drinkable
stout
but
not
what
i
would
have
called
outstanding
black
in
colour
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
very
dark
head
the
aromas
are
generally
sweet
and
malty
with
notes
of
milk
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
plum
the
flavors
are
quite
roasty
and
suggest
coffee
molasses
caramel
and
a
bit
more
chocolate
i
could
also
detect
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
as
well
but
most
of
the
bitterness
comes
from
the
roasted
malts
massive
body
to
this
one
too
d
this
milk
stout
has
nice
character
but
it
is
missing
some
depth
that
would
really
add
to
its
flavor
i
would
like
to
see
some
more
creaminess
in
the
mouthfeel
nice
stout
non
the
less
pours
jet
black
with
some
sediment
nice
creamy
tall
head
which
stays
for
a
while
smells
lightly
malty
sweet
with
some
bittersweet
coffechocolate
and
also
rather
fruity
taste
surprisingly
reminded
me
of
bittersweet
apple
cider
maybe
some
grapes
not
nearly
as
roasty
as
the
back
of
the
bottle
might
have
implied
quite
interesting
mouthfeel
was
thinish
but
smooth
quite
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
java
stout
just
blows
this
out
of
the
water
not
bad
by
any
means
a
decent
fruity
sweet
stout
and
a
solid
offering
from
bells
which
has
yet
to
disappoint
tastes
are
not
overly
defined
rather
laid
back
and
utterly
drinkable
fairly
thick
body
makes
the
kzoo
forceful
yet
not
bullying
this
is
fine
but
it
is
not
going
to
make
headlines
i
love
stouts
of
imperial
stature
i
cannot
remove
them
from
my
mind
as
i
review
this
beer
as
a
common
stout
this
one
will
do
i
would
prefer
something
more
over
the
top
though
might
as
well
go
big
another
great
beer
from
bells
pours
a
motor
oil
black
with
a
small
dark
tan
head
smells
of
chocolate
cream
and
toffee
taste
is
sweet
and
creamy
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
it
is
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
in
the
way
most
stouts
can
be
a
different
kind
of
drinkability
medium
body
though
it
isnt
really
a
session
beer
best
enjoyed
a
couple
at
a
time
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
a
killer
stout
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
bells
i
like
this
much
more
than
their
double
cream
stout
this
one
offers
more
complexity
and
richness
while
still
being
highly
drinkable
good
stuff
thanks
to
nerofiddled
for
the
trade
the
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
big
coffe
aroma
expresso
or
something
strong
chocolate
cream
and
a
roasted
background
a
very
nice
and
complex
aroma
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
expedition
but
toned
down
alot
personally
i
thought
the
expedition
was
slighly
overwhelming
which
is
definaetly
a
good
thing
because
i
can
pick
up
the
flavors
more
easily
the
taste
begins
with
a
big
coffee
note
which
is
followed
by
flavors
of
lightly
sweetened
dark
chocolate
cream
a
sweet
molasses
like
flavor
and
a
slightly
bitter
roasted
malt
and
hops
finish
really
a
well
executed
stout
kind
of
like
a
mini
expedition
or
maybe
the
expedition
stout
is
the
giant
kalamazoo
stout
but
really
tasty
and
complex
enough
to
satisfy
even
the
biggest
beer
snob
lightly
sweet
but
the
finish
is
bitter
to
balance
the
brew
quite
well
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
appropriate
for
the
style
and
the
drinkability
if
pretty
high
drinkability
goes
down
very
easy
definitely
could
session
if
one
were
so
inclined
bottle
deep
dark
brown
big
tan
head
bordering
on
brown
decent
lacing
nice
roasty
coffee
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
lots
of
roasty
grains
nice
full
bodied
roasty
flavor
hints
of
coffee
and
sweet
dark
chocolate
roasty
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
this
is
exceingly
drinkable
for
a
stout
lover
rich
and
satisfying
i
think
the
best
of
the
style
creamy
smooth
very
drinkable
overall
this
stout
can
be
many
things
to
different
palates
what
i
mean
is
this
stout
really
breathes
the
flavors
have
enough
space
between
them
that
leave
room
for
many
interpretations
i
love
it
for
its
subtleties
soft
silky
fluffy
and
a
tad
dry
but
never
chalky
not
sweet
but
very
creamy
roasted
malts
but
not
burnt
or
coffeeish
probably
the
perfect
balance
between
a
milk
and
dry
stout
a
marriage
of
the
two
styles
if
you
will
i
most
definitely
will
be
trying
this
throughout
the
year
to
experience
more
nuances
i
might
detect
a
true
flagship
from
bells
pours
opaque
black
with
a
khaki
colored
head
milk
chocolatey
aroma
mixed
coffee
and
roastedness
very
creamy
bittersweet
chocolately
taste
with
plenty
of
roasted
character
some
hops
bite
out
admist
the
huge
malty
smoothness
finish
is
roasted
dry
with
a
lingering
coffee
like
aftertaste
very
pleasant
to
sip
and
admire
the
finish
definitely
another
good
stout
from
bells
who
i
have
come
to
respect
as
talented
in
the
stout
field
drinkability
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
had
creeping
fairly
close
to
stone
irs
wish
i
had
easy
access
to
these
ive
been
damn
lucky
with
stouts
and
porters
as
of
recent
pours
out
thick
and
dark
with
a
dark
brown
head
sweet
malty
aroma
with
some
chocolate
the
aroma
is
good
but
not
strong
enough
the
flavor
is
very
strong
with
a
big
malty
flavor
up
front
followed
by
chocolate
and
a
solid
roasted
flavor
full
mouthfeel
mikshake
like
in
the
consistency
and
the
sweet
flavor
highly
drinkable
too
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
notice
my
review
is
higher
than
many
of
the
others
maybe
being
in
michigan
i
have
the
chance
to
get
this
beer
a
lot
fresher
than
bas
out
of
state
mouthfeel
is
luch
creamy
and
luxurious
carbonation
is
very
light
which
suits
this
style
just
fine
delicious
in
every
respect
more
please
slàinte
pours
inky
black
with
a
nice
mocha
colored
head
and
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
smoky
and
bittersweet
tastes
much
like
the
nose
smoky
roasted
malts
sweet
sugar
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
slightly
salty
hoppy
balance
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
the
perfect
balance
between
bitterness
and
cloying
sweetness
best
stout
ive
had
in
a
while
black
in
hue
it
is
damn
dark
when
backlit
there
is
a
slight
dark
brown
highlight
around
the
edges
the
color
is
beyond
ideal
the
head
was
brunette
in
color
the
tightly
compacted
bubbles
formed
a
head
of
two
fingers
in
height
the
head
retention
was
excellent
and
the
tight
cap
lasted
forever
there
was
some
spotty
subsequent
lacing
clingy
the
appearance
is
good
the
nose
is
soft
and
wellrounded
it
smells
like
espresso
with
milk
and
a
side
of
gourmet
chocolate
lightly
acidic
the
potency
is
moderate
i
like
what
this
beer
is
saying
it
is
fairly
complex
for
they
style
but
straightforward
it
is
pleasant
to
sniff
the
palate
matches
the
nose
perfectly
softly
roasty
malts
supply
some
coffee
notes
and
kisses
of
chocolate
milky
sweetness
dry
finish
with
a
long
roasted
coffee
bean
aftertaste
im
sure
this
beer
would
be
killer
with
cheesecake
the
palate
is
a
bit
straightforward
but
it
is
plenty
tasty
balanced
medium
in
body
low
but
natural
carbonation
with
a
pleasant
creamy
mouthfeel
it
feels
right
for
this
beer
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
quite
sessionable
if
youre
a
stout
fan
well
it
should
be
noted
that
the
6
5
abv
is
not
really
conducive
to
drinking
a
sixpack
at
once
it
if
is
any
consolation
the
alcohol
is
hidden
in
the
taste
maybe
it
would
bypass
your
brain
as
well
just
a
thought
it
is
no
frills
but
good
overall
it
is
more
roasty
and
dry
than
say
mackeson
triple
xxx
stout
both
are
good
beers
but
both
offer
different
interpretations
on
the
sweet
stout
style
i
obtained
a
sixpack
of
bells
pale
ale
and
i
drank
five
of
them
i
went
to
review
the
last
bottle
and
this
is
what
i
pulled
out
bastards
oh
well
payback
is
a
bitch
as
ive
substituted
beers
before
this
was
purchased
in
kansas
city
mo
it
is
a
solid
beer
this
is
a
nice
fullflavored
stout
im
not
disappointed
with
this
one
at
all
great
drinkable
stout
one
of
the
best
tasting
and
balanced
stouts
i
have
ever
had
smooth
malty
roasty
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
these
flavors
really
come
out
as
it
warms
a
nice
6
50
abv
pours
rather
thick
but
not
too
thick
with
a
creamytan
head
lacing
goes
all
the
way
down
the
glass
recommended
one
inch
to
an
inch
and
a
half
head
on
this
dark
beauty
wonderful
lacing
as
well
toffee
aroma
id
expect
a
bit
more
roastiness
in
the
aroma
for
a
stout
but
thats
just
me
taste
is
okay
a
bit
of
the
bells
yeast
funk
going
on
roasted
flavors
are
rather
muted
as
well
mouthfeel
is
good
and
coating
this
isnt
a
bad
stout
by
any
streach
of
the
imagination
but
it
fails
to
wow
me
this
pours
black
in
the
glass
with
a
thick
billowing
root
beer
float
kind
of
head
that
leaves
nice
patches
of
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
malts
biscuits
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
roastedburnt
coffee
flavors
in
the
end
absolutely
smooth
and
velvety
across
the
mouth
medium
to
full
bodyvery
drinkable
wildly
impressed
with
this
stout
a
dark
typical
looking
stout
with
a
bit
of
bubbly
brown
head
floating
around
smells
of
chocolate
milk
coffee
grounds
sweet
roasted
malts
taste
is
a
bit
off
though
it
tastes
too
much
like
coffee
i
think
its
a
great
flavor
to
have
in
a
beer
but
not
when
it
overpowers
everything
else
i
think
thats
the
case
here
dry
mouthfeel
but
a
bit
thick
as
well
strange
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
its
a
nice
try
maybe
itd
be
better
if
they
toned
down
the
coffee
taste
kalamazoo
stout
is
the
best
milksweet
stout
that
ive
had
yet
surpassing
bells
own
special
double
cream
stout
although
its
been
a
while
since
i
sampled
sdcs
its
one
of
the
biggest
and
boldest
6
5
abv
beers
that
youre
ever
likely
to
drink
and
is
truly
one
of
the
best
kudos
all
around
picked
this
beer
up
a
few
days
ago
because
i
tried
the
double
cream
stout
a
little
bit
ago
and
wanted
to
see
where
this
fell
in
relation
to
it
the
beer
pours
a
very
black
color
with
a
half
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
ring
the
beer
the
nose
is
great
balanced
between
the
chocolate
and
the
milky
marshmellow
creamyness
wow
the
flavor
is
not
quite
as
creamy
as
the
nose
tells
there
is
a
lot
of
chocolate
that
finishes
coffee
with
only
a
slight
bit
of
the
creamy
milky
tones
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
their
double
cream
but
not
a
bad
flavor
the
feel
is
nice
and
thick
with
a
velvety
creamy
smooth
texture
good
feel
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
i
enjoy
all
the
parts
of
it
i
will
have
to
have
this
again
when
i
find
it
solid
beer
pours
a
black
on
black
no
light
thru
this
baby
with
a
big
fluffy
chocolate
colored
head
that
leaves
a
good
lace
coat
looks
great
smell
is
lightly
roasted
malt
with
expresso
and
chocolate
present
some
light
fruits
in
background
taste
is
great
lightly
roasted
malt
expresso
flavors
with
some
hints
of
chocolate
moves
from
lightly
sweet
malt
to
burnt
bitterness
from
malt
aided
by
good
dose
of
hop
bite
a
great
stout
wish
i
could
get
this
down
in
tn
mouthfeel
is
right
side
of
medium
not
heavy
enough
to
be
creamy
but
still
feels
good
drinkability
is
good
man
this
is
one
tasty
beer
thanks
go
to
merlin48
for
this
tasty
treat
if
i
ever
make
it
to
the
liquor
barn
in
lexington
this
will
be
on
my
list
of
must
haves
thanks
to
pisskynights
and
feloniousmonk
for
sending
a
bottle
each
respectively
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
12oz
bottle
this
pours
an
inky
dark
brown
color
there
was
very
little
brown
head
to
this
one
the
aroma
is
raosted
coffee
with
some
sweetness
also
possible
chocolate
and
caramel
the
taste
is
quite
rich
it
is
silky
sweet
and
has
roasted
coffee
chocolate
full
bodied
extremely
nice
very
straightforward
and
not
overly
complex
but
still
a
fine
stout
this
has
a
deep
black
color
and
a
huge
brown
head
almost
as
dark
but
not
as
oily
looking
as
an
imperial
stout
the
head
leaves
heavy
lacing
there
is
a
delicious
sweet
malty
chocolaty
aroma
that
is
very
appealing
the
taste
is
great
it
starts
out
sweet
then
the
chocolaty
roasted
flavor
hits
and
it
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
also
great
i
hate
thin
tasting
stouts
but
this
one
has
some
nice
body
and
a
very
creamy
texture
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
leaves
one
waiting
for
a
secondgoround
a
very
drinkable
stout
overall
this
is
a
very
fine
drinking
stout
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
looking
for
a
classic
example
of
an
american
stout
poured
black
small
brown
head
with
very
little
lacing
aroma
was
a
very
pleasant
sweet
chocolate
carmel
and
molasses
my
nose
said
thank
you
got
a
nice
coffee
chocolate
taste
with
a
taste
of
raisins
ended
with
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
for
me
this
is
a
rich
and
impressive
drink
i
enjoy
it
but
dont
know
if
i
could
enjoy
more
than
one
at
a
setting
this
beer
is
a
solid
quality
representation
of
a
sweet
stout
and
i
find
it
always
a
pleasure
to
partake
of
which
is
quite
often
pours
out
a
pitch
black
with
a
slow
forming
head
that
works
its
way
up
to
about
an
inch
and
a
half
of
brown
foam
as
the
head
recedes
down
to
a
smaller
on
that
lasts
throughout
rings
of
lace
are
left
decorating
the
glass
picture
perfect
looking
brew
here
nice
head
good
lace
what
more
could
you
want
strong
aroma
with
roasted
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
coming
out
the
most
i
was
able
to
smell
this
as
i
was
pouring
it
taste
is
similar
with
a
bitter
coffee
flavor
up
front
and
a
slight
earthy
hoppiness
as
well
slight
bit
of
cream
to
the
flavor
before
it
ends
in
a
lingering
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
slick
with
a
medium
to
full
body
great
drinkability
as
this
went
down
very
easy
and
i
would
have
had
another
if
i
had
it
rich
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
medium
carbonation
nice
body
but
doesnt
quite
match
up
with
the
heavy
dose
of
roast
not
a
bad
stout
by
any
means
but
not
one
to
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
can
they
make
excellent
stouts
or
what
the
beer
came
in
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
when
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
body
was
black
with
brown
tones
the
head
was
rich
and
creamy
and
khaki
in
color
the
aroma
was
very
roasty
with
strong
black
coffee
being
the
prominent
smell
the
taste
was
robust
with
bitter
coffee
burnt
toast
raisins
and
unsweetened
cocoa
powder
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
soft
carbonation
the
aftertaste
was
dry
and
slightly
peppery
very
nice
and
drinkable
stout
that
has
an
amazing
depth
of
complexity
to
boot
many
thanks
go
to
ninjaworm
for
this
bottle
in
trade
pours
with
a
tiny
and
bubbley
dark
brown
head
the
smell
is
sour
and
acetyl
with
a
woddy
smell
oak
the
texture
of
this
beer
is
fantastic
on
the
palate
it
has
a
frothy
creaminess
to
is
but
the
beer
is
a
bit
empty
of
flavor
it
is
very
roasty
but
not
complex
at
all
which
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
simply
excellent
as
soon
as
i
finished
my
first
bottle
i
was
online
looking
up
the
brewery
and
how
far
it
was
from
st
louis
the
aroma
was
sublime
the
taste
was
warm
sweet
and
urging
me
to
take
another
sip
the
color
was
black
as
a
moonless
night
the
head
was
nice
and
thick
with
good
lacing
throughout
the
glass
from
the
bottle
comes
a
deep
dark
black
liquid
with
a
great
tan
creamy
fluffy
head
the
head
on
this
beer
was
present
for
much
of
the
beer
and
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
what
a
great
looking
beer
so
far
smells
of
milk
chocolate
cocoa
maybe
a
hint
of
coffee
and
slight
dark
fruit
tastes
are
a
nicely
roasty
malt
followed
by
some
sweet
chocolate
flavors
maybe
just
slightly
smoky
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
low
carbonation
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
this
could
probably
be
a
little
fuller
but
that
is
about
all
i
can
complain
about
pretty
drinkable
although
it
is
slightly
sweet
another
winner
from
bells
what
a
nice
beer
from
kzoo
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
bells
the
kind
kzoo
brew
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
sampled
a
milk
stout
this
one
is
quite
nice
the
head
is
thick
and
leaves
an
intricate
lacing
the
nose
is
quite
varied
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
hops
are
subdued
but
they
compliment
the
sweet
character
very
well
tastes
of
chocolate
combine
well
with
a
literally
bittersweet
character
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
dry
which
is
suprising
for
this
style
of
beer
quite
drinkable
and
tastey
drink
up
a
pitch
black
stout
with
a
small
saddle
colored
head
that
faded
to
a
ring
before
long
smell
eas
of
dark
coffee
and
semisweet
chocolate
with
a
gentle
acididty
to
the
back
taste
is
slightly
hoppy
for
a
milksweet
stout
but
not
imperial
hoppy
chocolate
malts
with
a
slight
sour
coffee
are
dominant
slight
pepper
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
heavy
thick
very
nice
beer
to
break
up
an
all
day
drinkathon
will
try
again
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
brown
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
dark
malt
scent
that
is
dominated
with
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
it
is
sweet
to
the
nose
and
seems
a
bit
creamy
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
dry
black
malt
flavor
with
some
chocolate
hints
and
a
semisweet
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
stout
it
has
great
aroma
and
flavor
a
good
sessions
ale
i
will
not
have
any
problem
drinking
the
rest
of
this
sixpack
overall
a
finely
crafted
beer
but
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
good
but
not
great
final
thought
the
bells
line
is
quite
impressive
with
this
being
the
best
of
the
breweries
stout
line
tastes
like
a
full
flavored
guinness
comments

big
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
the
hookup
i
think
this
would
be
my
favorite
sweeter
stout
to
date
would
make
a
very
good
session
stout
and
would
be
perfect
with
dessert
preferably
a
heaping
of
vanilla
ice
cream
poured
an
ink
black
that
allowed
no
light
through
even
when
held
up
to
a
lamp
good
deal
a
moderatly
thick
head
that
thinned
out
before
i
got
through
half
of
the
glass
little
to
no
lacing
last
couple
beers
have
been
like
that
maybe
its
me
aroma
was
of
burnt
malts
very
roasty
taste
was
of
expresso
with
a
ting
of
milk
sweetnes
peeking
through
aftertaste
was
that
of
a
sweetened
coffee
mouthfeel
was
of
a
full
bodied
brew
this
was
a
thicker
brew
and
i
dug
it
a
fine
beer
in
my
opinion
damn
fine
poured
black
as
crude
oil
with
a
monster
chocolatemilk
coloured
foamy
head
very
chocolatecoffee
like
in
smell
almost
like
melted
warm
chocolate
ice
cream
and
extremely
so
in
taste
quite
tasty
this
is
my
favourite
style
of
brew
to
begin
with
but
id
have
to
place
this
one
in
particular
in
my
top
five
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
and
quite
easy
to
drink
a
bit
heavy
but
so
is
the
nature
of
the
beast
i
have
yet
to
have
a
brew
of
this
style
that
wasnt
a
least
a
little
bit
heavy
i
strongly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
fancies
portersstouts
simply
one
of
the
best
sweet
stouts
ive
ever
tasted
this
stout
is
very
drinkable
for
dessert
and
after
might
be
a
bit
sweet
for
most
dinners
but
starting
with
dessert
and
even
a
couple
after
it
would
be
very
enjoyable
peering
out
through
its
opacity
i
was
impressed
by
the
depths
of
the
kzoo
stouts
darkness
there
wasnt
much
head

but
the
color
of
the
beer
almost
made
up
for
that
failing
the
coffee
and
chocolate
aroma
drew
me
deeper
in
love
with
this
black
beauty
the
strong
flavors
of
roasted
malt
provided
a
foundation
for
chocolate
coffee
and
a
few
hop
notes
its
a
most
excellent
full
bodied
and
warming
beer
the
alcohol
doesnt
play
on
the
palate
but
it
contributes
significantly
to
the
mouth
feel
poured
a
distinctly
opaque
black
nice
slight
tan
head
atop
nice
roasted
aromahints
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
huge
roasted
flavor
theresa
great
combination
of
mochalicoriceroasted
malt
and
chocolate
really
well
donenot
overly
complex
i
dont
find
the
residual
sweetness
you
get
in
some
other
milk
stouts
nice
full
mouthfeelfull
bodied
but
not
too
big
and
oily
very
drinkable
beer
it
pours
opaque
black
with
a
very
generous
longlasting
sticky
tan
head
in
my
fin
du
monde
glass
great
with
stouts
i
find
aroma
displays
very
creamy
malt
i
could
have
believed
this
was
a
milk
stout
roasted
chocolate
and
burnt
coffee
grains
complement
the
sweetness
very
round
and
full
mouthfeel
creamy
particularly
low
carbonation
alcohol
hint
accompanies
the
restrained
bitterness
in
the
finish
alcool
which
i
thought
should
not
be
felt
at
all
in
a
6
5
beer
with
all
that
roasted
malt
once
again
this
stout
got
this
milky
aspect
that
i
came
to
dislike
when
combined
with
an
almost
still
mouthfeel
it
feels
not
unlike
a
wine
just
dead
in
the
mouth
despite
all
the
licorice
molasses
chocolatey
flavors
from
the
dark
malts
well
done
but
still
severly
overrated
to
my
tastes
and
definitely
nowhere
near
as
complex
as
expedition
smooth
yet
ultimately
close
but
no
cigar
the
beer
isnt
thin
yet
it
also
isnt
very
thick
also
it
lacks
the
really
heavy
taste
akin
to
a
brooklyn
black
choc
stout
but
it
is
still
rather
good
on
its
own
right
id
pick
up
another
sixer
of
this
sometime
for
sure
had
this
again
after
three
years
and
it
really
hits
the
spot
often
imitated
never
copied
bitterness
is
so
well
controlled
by
roast
and
malt
not
overwhelming
coffee
either
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
big
ol
1
mochahued
head
above
an
opaque
dark
brownblack
brew
dense
head
has
good
staying
power
and
laced
tremendously
aroma
is
of
coffee
and
choco
malts
with
a
bit
of
milk
sweetness
that
rounds
it
out
nicely
the
taste
is
follows
the
aromas
map
and
the
sweetness
really
rounds
out
the
flavor
on
the
palate
dont
know
where
that
6
5
is
hiding
but
it
was
cloaked
with
some
artistic
brewing
if
i
had
to
find
a
fault
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
such
a
hearty
brew
but
this
is
really
nitpicking
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
enjoyed
just
wish
it
was
more
widely
available
somewhat
disappointed
in
this
one
bottle
appears
to
be
fresh
and
has
been
stored
properly
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
possibly
an
offbottle
here
judging
from
other
reviews
lack
of
carbonation
and
the
mysterious
sour
element
in
the
taste
are
my
reasons
for
wondering
about
this
one
this
was
a
very
dark
beer
midnight
black
in
color
and
topped
off
with
a
tan
creamy
head
of
foam
the
aroma
is
malty
and
rich
with
chocolate
syrup
sweet
and
buttery
with
molasses
and
caramel
the
taste
is
pleasantly
rich
and
very
smooth
not
overly
anything
sweetness
is
right
on
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
roasted
bitterness
good
malt
body
with
some
of
that
roasted
bitterness
coming
through
in
the
finish
and
lingering
in
the
throat
overall
a
very
pleasant
and
an
exceptionally
drinkable
dark
beer
pours
a
jet
black
with
almost
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
a
little
different
i
smell
some
butter
and
im
not
sure
what
else
to
be
exact
it
wasnt
an
awful
aroma
just
not
the
best
either
taste
is
full
of
roasted
malts
and
yeast
not
very
well
balanced
if
you
asked
me
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
as
this
is
a
nice
thick
creamy
stout
this
isnt
my
favorite
stout
by
any
means
but
i
wonder
if
i
just
got
an
off
bottle
the

basic
stout
while
not
exceptionally
strong
or
earthy
i
can
sip
it
all
night
as
slow
as
i
want
at
whatever
temperature
i
want
and
it
never
becomes
overwhelming
or
lose
its
appeal
when
you
dont
feel
like
youre
up
to
handle
an
imperial
stout
but
you
still
want
that
thick
earthy
feeling
and
full
mouthfeel
look
to
kalamazoo
as
an
easy
drinking
stout
that
has
a
taste
that
is
simple
and
subtle
this
beer
would
be
something
else
if
the
diacetyl
was
cleaned
up
a
bit
having
said
that
if
you
dont
mind
a
bit
of
diacetyl
this
would
be
a
really
good
beer
for
you
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
some
reddish
highlights
as
well
as
a

that
very
slowly
recedes

it
does

cocoa

blended
with
fresh
brewed
butterpecan
coffee
medium
to
full
in
body
and
quite
smooth
and
creamy
in
texture
taste
begins
with
notes
of
french
roast
followed
by
unsweetened
dark
chocolate
and
some
spicy
yeasts
some
faint
smoky
charcoal
is
present
towards
the
finish
as
well
as
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
probably
not
what
id
call
a
milkcreamsweet
stout
but
quite
enjoyable
nevertheless

my
new
favorite
beer
theres
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
smell
these
flavors
show
through
stronger
in
the
taste
you
can
also
make
out
carmel
hops
and
a
breadyyeasty
flavor
its
all
very
balanced
and
very
enjoyable

alcohol

this
one

pint
glass
arrived
with
a
nice
creamy
thick
tan
head
i
must
say
that
the
appearance
of
that
glass
as
the
server
brought
it
was
the
best
part
of
the
beer
a
nice
lace
coated
the
glass
from
the
top
to
the
last
drop
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
faintly
licorice
odor
it
also
had
a
fairly
noticeable
licorice
flavor
that
i
personally
didnt
care
for
a
nice
roastiness
tried
to
chase
it
away
and
that
is
what
saved
the
beer
and
made
it
drinkable
it
did
have
a
full
substantial
mouthfeel
overall
i
thought
it
was
adequate
but
unremarkable

with

is
that

in

and
weak
way
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
carbonated
more
than
a
traditional
stout
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
pours
a
jet
black
with
little
head
the
aroma
is
of
a
sweet
chocolate
and
hint
of
coffee
but
isnt
that
powerful
the
taste
is
a
blast
of
chocolate
and
espresso
that
blend
very
well
together
this
taste
lingered
in
my
mouth
for
quite
sometime
afterwards
this
is
a
very
sweet
mellow
brew
again
the
mouthfeel
and
aftertaste
are
outstanding
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
any
occasion
and
a
must

for

quite
sweetly
at

proceeding
to
huge
roastiness
in

a
slight

sweetness
lingers
here
to
the

of
the

then
hops
make
their

known
in

and
yet
again
a
fruitiness
almost
like

around
in

and
a

more
oaken
than

mouthfeel
is
tingly

delicate

just
approaching

with

subsides

very

theres

this

was
very
comforting
started

with
a
strong
flat
cola
taste
i
find
this
to
be
positive
and
finshed
with
a
bunch
of
roasted
coffee
overall
a
extremely
drinkable
and
tasty
stout
probably
one
of
the
more
flavorful
nonimperials
i
have
had
in
a
while
the
flavors
all
blend
together
really
nicely

and

delicious
this
is
trendy
these
days
but
bells
was
out
ahead
of
the
curve
and
has
produced
another
good
variant
here
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
the
flavors
are
all
subtle
which
is
both
good
and
bad
it
makes
for
an
easy
to
drink
beer
problem
is
the
finish
is
weak
and
i
cant
pinpoint
any
outstanding
qualities
pretty
nice
beer
and
worth
checking
out
seems
like
more
of
a
milksweet
stout
than
a
regular
stout
i
wouldve
liked
the
rye
to
play
a
more
prominent
part
but
overall
it
was
a
pretty
tasty
beer
m
medium
body
light
carbonation
overall
easy
and
sessionable
but
slightly
bitter
for
a
bells
stout
cherry
expedition
etc
it
was
below
average
but
easily
above
average
for
every
other
stout
out
there
enjoyable
and
would
drink
again
i
think
the
next
bottle
ill
drink
as
my
first
beer
of
the
day
to
try
and
get
a
better
grasp
on
the
rye
aspect
o
decent
beer
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
try
this
at
3
for
4oz
i
would
probably
skip
it
next
time
overall
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
there
was
rye
in
this
but
its
a
fairly
tasty
stout
from
bells
overall
decent
offering
from
bells
enjoyable
stout
with
impressive
profiles
all
around
fuller
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
dry
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
a
nice
hybrid
between
the
stout
and
rye
qualities
something
id
definitely
drink
again
o
its
decent
creative
too
i
probably
wouldnt
revisit
but
doesnt
mean
you
shouldnt
had
a
pint
at
the
bells
cafe
i
enjoyed
the
earthy
roasted
character
but
overall
the
stout
was
just
a
little
too
thick
and
sweet
for
my
liking
this
is
a
pretty
big
thick
stout
but
didnt
have

complexity

want

finish

a

the

is
completely
sweet
odd
brew
that
i
completely
enjoyed
overall
i
enjoyed
the
experiment
with
rye
but
i
think
that
it
doesnt
really
impart
too
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
and
i
came
up
thinking
that
the
stout
could
have
used
a
bit
more
in
that
department
this
would
be
a
very
interesting
beer
to
barrelage
or
flavor
with
wood
as
it
is
its
easy
to
drink
but
was
left
a
bit
cold
by
it
possibly
because
all
the
brews
at
their
cafe
were
served
extremely
cold
o
the
rye
makes
it
different
but
thats
about
it
for
this
beer
thought
it
was
good
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
found
this
one
to
be
pretty
interesting
this
beer
pours
out
like
most
stouts
do
with
a
deep
black
color
and
brown
head
the
lacing
was
pretty
good
on
this
one
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
deep
roasted
aroma
and
had
a
pretty
good
amount
of
rye
on
the
nose
the
taste
had
an
impressive
amount
of
spicy
rye
too
the
mouthful
was
at
a
good
thickness
overall
i
enjoyed
this
stout
quite
a
bit
im
a
big
fan
of
rye
beers
so
i
was
very
pleased
to
see
this
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
its
easy
enough
to
find
a
rye
ipa
or
lighter
beer
much
harder
to
find
a
rye
stout
i
really
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
poured
dark
brown
approaching
black
with
a
creamy

smells
of
spicy
rye
balanced
beatifully
with
some
firm
malt
and
some
roastiness
tastes
similar
and
very
nice
lovely
gobs
of
spicy
rye
supported
by
lightly
roasty
malt
and
a
huge
creaminess
the
rye
really
shines
here
and
isnt
overwhelmed
by
charred
notes
great
beer
black

with
little
head
unpleasantly
reminiscent
of
blended
black
and
tans
the
flavors
are
lacking
in
coffee
notes
but
almost
compensates
with
nice
toasted
malt
flavors
the
smooth
dry
finish
is
a
high
note
for
this
blandish
understated
stout
while
the
carobonation
is
nice
and
the
brew
is
smooth
it
lacks
the
creaminess
expected
overall
eh
o
d
a

a
good
drink
this
is
a
good
beer
though
bells
for
me
has
always
been
topnotch
to
this
point
still
id
drink
this
again
for
sure
d
just
not
very
impressed
this
was
my
first
bells
and
i
was
impressed
i
was
told
this
isnt
even
one
of
bells
best
so
i
cannot
wait
to
try
their
other
concoctions
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
i
expected
more
from
a
stout
from
bells
overall
was
a
great
stout
that
i
would
recommend
overall
this
was
not
bad
however
it
was
a
little
underwhelming
for
me
i
expect
everything
from
bells
to
really
push
through
and
hammer
down
styles
i
was
just
not
so
sure
this
one
was
really
that
big
of
a
winner
definitely
worth
a
try
no
doubt
just
not
as
big
as
i
hoped
it
would
be

toffee
also
strikes
me
in
the
flavor
definitely
a
decent
brew
but
pales
in
comparison
to
other
bells
stouts
still
its
better
than
a
lot
of
other
breweries
efforts
dsuper
easy
to
drink
really
like
the
unique

cant
really
pin

it

like
it
will
get
this

the
stout
has
a
very
sweet
chocolatey
caramel
flavor
clearly
the
result
of
a
pleasant
malt
mixture
the
flavors
meld
together
seamlessly
allowing
the
stout
character
and
a
bit
of
rye
sharpness
to
come
together
nicelessly
the
rye
sharpness
is
a
nice
undertone
that
keeps
the
stout
together
the
velvety
smooth
stout
is
a
joy
to
drink
chocolatey
yet
silky
smooth
a
delicious
ale
the
ale
is
smooth
and
sweet
delicious
without
going
overboard
on
the
roasted
malt
element
bells
really
knows
how
to
do
a
stout
not
my
favorite
from
them
but
very
solid
overall
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
beer
however
i
found
the
rye
influence
to
be
more
muted
than
i
would
have
liked
still
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
good
deal
of
complexity
thats
worth
a
shot
d
very
good
i
had
to
fight
the
urge
to
drink
this
beer
quicker
than
i
did
which
is
often
true
anyway
but
savoring
it
was
well
worth
the
effort
overall
a
really
solid
stout
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
highly
recommend
would
love
to
try
a
fresher
one
as
well
to
compare
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
shipped
back
from
my
indy
trip
rotation
this
is
an
occasional
release
but
id
get
a
sixer
or
two
per
release
if
i
lived
where
available
for
now
id
definitely
get
more
to
ship
back
during
trips
to
the
folks
also
would
get
a
6
to
drink
while
in
indy
ryship
rye
stout
is
easily
drinkable
enjoyable
its
solid
too
i
just
wish
the
rye
was
cranked
up
several
notches
ill
have
to
give
a
fresh
bottle
a
go
sometime
to
see
if
thats
the
issue
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
the
rye
stout
substyle
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
when
you
want
something
thats
a
bit
different
than
youre
normal
stout
d
not
the
most
rye
beer
ive
had
making
it
more
approachable
and
a
good
learning
beer
for
a
person
just
getting
into
rye
d
okay
but
i
had
much
higher
expectations
im
not
sure
if
they
followed
my
advice
after
my
last
review
bottle
or
if
its
just
that
much
better
out
of
the
tap
or
if
my
palate
changed
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
have
before
and
i
tasted
it
from
a
tap
at
a
bar
in
chi
recently
and
i
think
my
thoughts
then
were
what
my
past
review
in
607
reflected
very
easy
drinker
for
7
drinkability
for
a
rye
stout
its
pretty
drinkable
thanks
in
large
part
to
the
lightness
and
the
coffee
which
blends
the
alcohol
into
the
background
quite
effortlessly
the
slight
sweetness
makes
it
that
much
easier
to
open
another
bottle
d
ya
dont
believe
i
will
be
having
this
again
just
unremarkable
overall
sorry
bells
d
this
is
my
first
rye
stout
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
come
back
to
it
again
super
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
amount
of
flavour
going
on
here
pours
a
dark
black
that
doesnt
appear
to
be
too
viscous
a
pretty
decentsized
medium
brown
head
plenty
of
rye
and
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
flavor
is
similar
along
with
a
little
bit
of
coffee
medium
to
full
body
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
high
good
take
on
the
rye
beer
category
one
of
the
more
unique
ones
ive
had
within
the
style
the
flavor
finds
spicy
rye
grains
battling
it
out
with
roasted
milk
chocolate
malts
earthy
soily
hops
grab
hold
of
the
tastebuds
and
provide
a
lasting
bitterness
the
carbonation
was
really
a
sleeper
and
it
fired
up
after
the
pour
to
lash
the
palate
with
spritzy
sharp
bubbles
on
into
the
finish
rye
eventually
pushes
out
the
rest
of
the
malt
unfortunately
because
i
think
the
base
for
this
beer
is
probably
delicious
still
rye
stout
is
tasty
and
i
applaud
bells
for
the
ingenuity
again
it
helps
that
i
love
rye
pick
this
up
and
give
it
a
try
the
light
body
and
high
carbonation
levels
the
finish
loses
the
harshness
but
the
tartness
continues
as
it
fades
quickly
with
some
lingering
sweetness
d
i
really
liked
this
beer
something
quite
a
bit
different
would
drink
this
again
it
is
a
very
drinable
beer
and
a
great
stout
but
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
flavor
from
the
rye
when
it
comes
to
something
that
has
rye
in
the
name
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
very
good
stout
not
too
heavy
but
carries
enough
of
a
presence
to
fill
you
up
might
need
a
little
more
carbonation
but
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
smokiness
and
roasted
flavor
make
it
good
tasting
however
the
strong
flavor
hinders
the
drinkability
overall
i
dont
dislike
the
beer
but
its
definitely
one
of
the
least
remarkable
of
the
dark
side
case
i
found
it
to
lack
the
complexity
of
the
expedition
or
the
third
coast
though
i
understand
that
they
are
different
styles
of
stout
i
guess
they
cant
all
be
first
place
winners
and
its
not
my
least
favorite
in
the
case
either
the
stout
pours
near
black
with
a
bit
of
a
garnet
hue
when
held
to
the
light
the
moderate
fluffy
tan
head
diminished
to
a
skin
with
just
a
hint
of
a
lace
the
aroma
is
moderately
roasty
along
with
some
hints
of
chocolate
the
flavor
is
moderatehigh
malt
bittersweet
upfront
followed
by
roast
and
chocolate
the
roast
character
of
the
malt
hop
bitterness
and
maybe
rye
give
a
spicy
slightly
dry
finish
that
is
pleasant
and
leaves
just
a
bit
of
bittersweet
malt
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
moderate
and
body
medium
overall
well
crafted
stout
rather
drinkable
yet
a
lot
of
flavor
maybe
a
bit
less
roast
than
most
stouts
and
more
bittersweet
malt
with
a
spicyslightly
dry
finish
this
beer
suffers
a
bit
on
drinkability
it
does
sort
of
overwhelm
you
after
awhile
drinking
more
than
one
12oz
bottle
would
be
tough
a
solid
offering
overall
though
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
would
venture
to
say
that
this
wouldnt
be
a
stretch
for
your
guinness
drinkers
overall
no
one
quality
is
overpowering
enjoyable
and
a
unique
twist
on
a
stout
but
not
the
best
option
rye
has
been
done
better
o
a
good
stout
not
a
lot
of
rye
but
worth
getting
a
sixer
of
d
this
is
a
very
good
stout
the
rye
added
a
sweetness
to
a
bitter
stout
d
nice
big
roasty
flavors
dominate
bready
smokey
and
tasty
as
all
hell
though
a
bit
of
a
sipper
still
damn
fine
brew
drinkability
is
good
any
lower
abv
stout
with
this
much
flavor
is
a
winner
in
my
book
a
little
too
carbonated
off
the
bat
but
once
i
got
to
the
end
of
the
glass
it
felt
just
perfect
the
roasted
malts
are
a
little
too
sharp
for
an
excellent
drinkability
bottle
poured
a
deep
pitchblack
color
stout
with
a
small
dark
brown
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
minimal
lacing

of
roasted
malt
with
light
peat
notes
taste
is
very
particular
with
some
good
peat
notes
and
deep
roasted
malt
body
is
quite
full
with
a
very
nice
creamy
texture
and
good
carbonation
very
singular
since
i
am
not
used
to
rye
being
used
in
a
stout
but
still
very
interesting
mouthfeel
is
coating
as
each
swallow
glides
down
my
throat
there
must
be
some
oatmeal
in
there
to
make
it
so
creamy
carbonation
is
a
little
too
crisp
while
cold
let
it
warm
up
a
little
and
it
expands
in
its
chewiness
this
is
not
like
any
stout
ive
ever
had
and
its
fantastic
d
i
need
to
find
a
six
pack
of
this
because
it
opened
my
eyes
being
that
there
are
not
a
lot
of
rye
stouts
out
there
this
moved
me
i
also
want
to
see
if
there
is
any
difference
in
appearence
vs
the
kegged
version
this
is
easy
drinking
and
probably
my
favorite
of
bells
lower
abv
dark
beer
offerings
will
have
again
da
well
done
beer
by
bells
and
an
interesting
way
to
do
a
stout
i
could
go
with
a
little
more
rye
but
i
would
imagine
that
is
hard
to
pull
off
with
the
bold
roasted
malt
presence
growler
purchased
from
liquor

in

with
about
an
inch

are
both
good
aroma
is
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
rye
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
dark
fruit
and
a
little
bit
of
licorice
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
and
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
winter
day
id
definitely
buy
this
again
d
i
like
it
i
could
have
another
i
think
but
again
my
lack
of
experience
in
the
rye
area
doesnt
allow
me
much
insight
into
the
exact
uniqueness
of
this
over
say
bells
java
stout
drinkability
a
rye
stout
is
an
interesting
concept
and
this
is
good
but
its
not
quite
up
to
the
standards
of
most
bells
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
bells
or
those
who
love
rye
but
a
bit
lacking
for
my
palate
d
decently
drinkable
smooth
a
little
heavy
though
and
will
fill
you
up
d
this
is
a
seriously
tasty
stout
bells
is
a
master
w
so
many
great
tasting
stouts
this
is
one
of
the
best
they
make
as
the
rye
addition
is
not
overdone
just
enough
to
compliment
the
caramel
and
dark
malt
flavor
the
smokiness
adds
complexitytruly
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
stout
with
any
glaring
weaknesses
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
i
initially
questioned
this
brew
i
was
so
wrong
and
will
never
ever
question
a
brew
from
bells
again
high
drinkability
very
manageable
abv
and
tastes
great
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
on
top
of
all
the
roasted
malt
characteristics
it
is
pretty
easy
drinking
the
cocoa
in
the
aroma
is
awesome
i
am
glad
that
they
brought
this
one
back
d
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
bells
the
rye
brings
a
nice
bready
quality
to
the
stout
as
well
as
accentuates
the
roasted
malt
and
barley
characteristics
of
the
brew
bells
offers
a
solid
lineupbut
i
still
have
not
found
a
bells
brew
that
really
wows
me
pours
a
dark
black
cherry
color
with
a
quick
dissipating
head
it
does
have
some
clinging
sticky
lacing
the
smell
was
toffee
and
fig
some
caramel
and
rye
the
taste
was
rye
and
spice
with
chocolate
and
some
roasted
coffee
this
is
one
good
stout
that
may
be
overlooked
i
like
the
addition
of
rye
to
this
style
its
sweet
and
robust
a
well
balanced
stout
that
is
highly
drinkable
from
a
brewery
that
puts
out
lots
of
stouts
another
fine
one
from
bells
this
is
good
but
a
bit
thin
for
me
tasty
beer
overall
though
should
be
a
bells
staple
for
every
winter
have
to
thank
grumpy
for
sending
me
this
one
off
of
my
wants
list
poured
a
deep
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
chocolate
and
lightly
roasted
malts
in
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
rye
taste
was
nice
and
simple
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
some
rye
all
perfectly
balanced
each
flavor
complimenting
the
next
although
the
head
wasnt
too
impressive
the
carbonation
was
present
in
the
mouthfeel
which
added
nicely
to
the
beer
very
smooth
and
super
drinkable
medium
to
full
body
this
beer
doesnt
try
to
overwhelm
you
with
flavors
it
just
uses
each
flavor
extremely
well
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
had
high
hopes
and
it
did
not
disappoint
hope
to
get
more
soon
d
very
drinkable
and
delicious
alcohol
is
well
masked
and
this
is
quite
drinkable
d
quite
good
i
could
have
several
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
night
very
balanced
and
im
quite
pleased
to
discover
it
rather
fair
drinkability
big
and
flavorful
this
beer
is
worthy
of
a
good
session
in
the
winter
months
medium
bodied
and
quite
soft
very
quaffable
the
rye
seems
to
work
well
with
this
beer
whereas
most
rye
beers
seem
to
be
hoppier
expressions
where
the
hops
overpower
the
rye
here
the
rye
has
a
chance
to
express
itself
well
done
bells
thin
tan
headbut
it
has
decent
retention
the
body
is
pretty
much
black
only
a
little
bit
of
brown
shines
through
the
edges
of
the
glass
chocolatey
sweet
flavors
combo
nicely
with
the
rye
bit
of
a
smokey
quality
to
this
really
rich
and
luxurious
stuff
once
again
bells
has
made
an
outstanding
stout
not
bad
an
average
stout
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
with
a
rye
stout
but
there
is
not
much
rye
from
what
i
can
detect
it
is
still
worth
a
try
the
beer
is
poured
a
black
to
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
to
light
caramel
colored
head
on
top
the
deep
chocolate
and
coffee
aromas
come
out
at
first
scent
there
is
a
slight
fragrance
of
dark
bread
and
rye
to
finish
each
scent
the
dark
malt
dominates
the
palate
at
the
beginning
with
chocolate
and
dark
bread
roll
across
the
palate
there
is
a
hint
of
coffee
as
well
it
finishes
with
a
touch
of
rye
sharpness
and
a
mild
pine
flavor
that
lingers
shortly
then
fading
away
the
feel
is
hearty
a
milky
texture
at
the
start
then
gradually
thinning
leaving
a
medium
dryness
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
a
pleasing
color
strong
aroma
and
flavor
along
with
the
rich
feel
make
this
a
beer
to
crave
each
taste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
a
little
on
the
light
side
but
that
makes
it
easy
to
throw
a
few
back
12oz
bottle
from
a
sixer
purchased
in
detroit
in
december
2009
the
beer
is
nearly
opaque
dark
burnt
reddish
brown
thin
tan
foam
the
aroma
is
nice
roasted
malts
chocolate
a
nice
dose
of
rye
just
brilliant
the
taste
is
no
slouch
either
roasted
but
not
overly
bitter
some
rye
spiciness
that
contrasts
the
dark
malts
possibly
some
wheat
but
its
hard
to
tell
through
all
the
other
rich
flavors
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
maybe
some
oatmeal
was
added
seems
like
bells
pulled
all
stops
on
this
one
outstanding
and
delicious
needs
to
be
a
standard
beer
a
very
sessionable
stout
from
bells
not
great
but
very
solid
notes
maybe
not
outstanding
and
surely
for
my
liking
i
would
be
expecting
a
far
more
assertive
rye
profile
and
still
leves
me
wondering
what
a
stout
like
that
would
be
like
here
it
works
on
a
rather
subtle
and
balanced
side
giving
a
decent
and
fairly
likeable
stout
d
pretty
easy
drinking
considering
its
close
to
7
it
was
interesting
in
that
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
beers
with
a
rye
component
ill
be
sure
to
try
others
and
probably
come
back
to
this
one
a
very
solid
winter
stout
i
cant
really
find
much
wrong
with
this
despite
a
lackluster
nose
this
ultimately
emerges
as
an
enjoyable
drinkable
stout
given
a
bit
of
a
twist
thanks
to
the
rye
not
a
huge
wallop
of
godliness
but
certainly
not
a
purchase
to
be
sad
about
that
poor
thing
on
the
label
must
not
have
had
enough
money
to
purchase
a
bottle
cheer
up
you
drinkability
is
great
and
leaves
me
desireing
more
then
this
one
bottle
fizzy
for
the
style
but
a
good
heavy
feel
very
easy
drinker
for
a
stout
good
fullness
for
the
abv
overall
of
their
6
stouts
this
one
is
just
ok
d
it
had
high
drinkability
i
could
have
kept
drinking
this
one
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
the
rye
isnt
overdone
and
mixes
with
the
stout
body
surprisingly
well
its
very
quaffable
and
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
now
if
it
just
had
a
tinge
more
body
this
thing
would
be
a
homerun
d
very
complex
and
exciting
and
yet
very
drinkable
perfect
for
a
slow
session
where
one
drinks
two
or
three
over
a
period
of
four
or
five
hours
like
a
movie
or
a
night
of
chatting
d
this
started
off
as
a
nice
stout
and
it
really
could
have
finished
as
a
good
stout
but
the
addition
of
the
rye
kind
of
knocked
it
down
for
me
i
like
both
stouts
and
rye
beers
but
this
combination
just
didnt
work
for
me
it
was
just
an
okay
beer
overall
this
is
a
fairly
easy
beer
to
drink
but
mostly
because
there
is
a
lack
of
intensity
but
solid
components
fairly
good
but
i
would
have
preferred
more
kick
to
this
beer
my
hopes
were
high
because
1
bells
typically
makes
good
stouts
and
2
i
love
rye
beers
the
rye
is
very
unfortunately
a
minor
player
in
this
stout
this
should
have
been
an
imperial
stout
as
more
body
and
more
rye
would
have
made
for
an
improved
product
as
is
this
beer
is
too
expensive

this
is

this
could

in

if
you
like

this
is

better

yet
make

12
oz
your

o
this
is
a
stout
made
to

easy
on
the
tongue

not
one
to

the
elements
are
clear
and
present
and
yep
coffee
is
at
its
core

good
poured

fell

very

almost
black
with
a

coffee
smell
tastes
of
coffee
with
a
little
burnt
chocolate
in
the
background
mildly
carbonated
but
very
well
balanced
overall
a
nice
stout
that
has
a
coffee
lean
to
it

is
balanced
strong
coffee
balanced
by
smooth
chocolate
tastes
better
at

pretty

nothing
overly

here
a
bit
pricey
for
a
sixer
glad
i
was
able
to
pick
up
one
bottle
to
try
if
you
like
black
coffee
give
this
one
a
try
nice
hints
of
coffee
aroma
the
taste
is
really
quite
subtle
for
such
a
stout
the
roastedcoffee
flavor
lasts
a
long
time
on
the
finish
not
sweet
at
all
but
i
have
a
hard
time
attributing
that
to
hops
or
to
coffee
or
to
overroasted
malt
overall
a
very
good
stout
not
sure
it
earns
the
elite
stout
price
the
aroma
is
coffee
and
roasty
with
a
definite
coffee
character
the
flavor
has
a
touch
of
the
coffee
astringency
with
a
big
shot
of
coffee
taste
sharp
and
bitter
on
the
finish
with
a
thinner
yet
distinct
body
i
feel
like
this
is
a
wake
up
call
in
a
bottle
other
than
the
expedition
stout
bells
has
really
disappointed
me
this
beer
had
a
bit
of
a
tinny
after
taste
and
was
not
as
full
bodied
as
i
expected
it
to
be
i
usually
love
dark
beers
with
chococoffee
notes
but
this
was
a
dud
hopefully
a
bad
batchbottle
because
i
poured
it
out
o
a
bit
too
roastforward
for
my
taste
but
definitely
a
drinkable
coffee
stout
if
you
prefer
dark
strong
coffee
and
dark
strong
beer
you
will
love
this
one
its
like
drinking
your
favorite
stout
with
the
smell
and
reminiscent
taste
of
a
deliciously
dark
roasted
coffee
another
great
beer
from

i
had
two
fantastic
coffee
stouts
in
the
last
week
this
one
and
the
whole
hog
expresso
stout
from
point
well
done
overall
for
the
price
this
is
not
that
good
if
this
beer
was
about
the
same
is
two
hearted
then
i
would
consider
it
a
better
option
but
considering
other
breweries
are
putting
out
better
beer
in
the
same
category
for
less
money
then
this
beer
doesnt
get
the
rating
from
me
i
think
price
is
what
kills
this
one
most
of
all
otherwise
its
an
alright
beer
the
last

at

for

not

abv
beer
thatd
id
buy
again
overall
really
great
coffee
stout
gives
its
obvious
competitor
fbs
a
pretty
serious
run
for
its
money
with
its
betterdeveloped
coffee
flavors
really
really
great
nice
deep
chocolate
color
with
decent
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
coffee
and
chcocolate
taste
is
a
hit
of
roasted
coffee
beans
right
up
front
followed
by
some
sweet
and
bitter
malts
and
then
a
kick
of
alcohol
feels
ok
on
the
palate
the
bitterness
is
just
a
touch
too
much
but
overall
this
stout
balances
pretty
good
bells
most
underrated
beer
big
coffee
notes
and
very
enjoyable
omg
such
a
delicious
coffee
stout
think
pungent
aroma
heavy
but
not
gutwrenching
nice
balance
a
winter
seasonal
pouring
black
and
creamy
with
a
nice
tan
head
has
a
big
coffee
nose
and
palate
with
rich
roast
flavors
accented
by
the
coffee
perfect
balance
between
the
coffee
the
roast
malts
and
the
alcohol
chewy
with
medium
low
carbonation
eh
not
something
i
think
ill
go
for
again
o
like
the
smell
taste
was
somewhat
of
a
let
down
didnt
care
for
the
bitter
acid
like
finish
coming
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewerys
this
was
a
disappointment
maybe
it
sat
to
long
in
my
beer
celler
will
get
a
fresher
one
and
rereview
at
some
point
overall
not
totally
impressed
but
im
glad
i
took
the
time
to
try
it
as
it
did
go
down
pretty
easy
mf
smooth
mediumbodied
with
a
super
dry
finish
a
bit
less
carbonated
than
expected
a
round
start
with
a
prickly
thin
finish

o
another
great
offering
from
bells
this
is
how
i
like
my
coffee
beers
with
a
subtle
blend
that
doesnt
take
your
head
off
a
nice
brunchtime
wakerupper
the
chocolate
certainly
is
my
favorite
part
of
this
brew
malt
backbone
is
rich
and
the
coffee
isnt
overwhelming
for
this
non
coffee
lover
o
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
any
coffee
enthusiast
i
think
the
price
tag
is
a
little
steep
for
what
youre
getting
but
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
o
its
a
decent
coffee
stout
but
i
would
have
like
to
have
seen
a
fuller
body
and
more
complexity
in
the
taste
and
aroma
o
this
is
my
favorite
everyday
stout
i
love
the
coffee
taste
so
if
that
is
not
your
thing
this
beer
is
not
for
you
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
coffee
stout
try
this
beer
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
overall
this
is
a
very
good
stout
i
would
most
definitely
drink
this
again
i
may
buy
it
again
if
i
see
it
but
i
likely
wont
be
on
the
hunt
for
it
almost
pitch
black
with
a
tiny
bit
of
red
around
the
edges
and
half
a
finger
of
khaki
head
the
nose
is
a
bouquet
of
coffee
shop
aromas
including
coffee
beans
vanilla
chocolate
cream
and
roasted
grains
and
malts
coffee
comes
through
big
on
the
taste
with
a
bitterness
that
is
attenuated
by
a
sweetness
from
unfermented
sugars
i
also
get
some
milk
chocolate
and
a
nutty
character
feels
nice
and
creamy
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
for
breakfast
on
a
brew
day
or
on
a
golf
course
its
not
something
to
grab
every
day
there
are
better
coffee
stouts
out
there
this
one
is
just
ok
overall
delicious
coffee
stout
quite
reminiscent
of
the
lagunitas
cappuccino
stout
id
buy
it
if
it
were
available
in
california
but
wouldnt
trade
for
it
again
if
only
because
it
tastes
so
close
to
the
aforementioned
brew
pours
a
jet
black
with
minimal
head
but
excellent
lacing
smells
like
fine
roasted
coffee
with
dark
chocolate
taste
is
similar
of
coffee
and
subtle
chocolate
very
roasty
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
very
smooth
and
full
bodied
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
fresh
and
only
thought
it
was
ok
now
having
a
bottle
with
over
a
year
on
it
has
really
helped
it
to
fill
out
it
seems
to
have
become
much
more
smooth
and
rich
especially
in
the
mouth
feel
im
changing
my
rating
from
a
3
5
to
4
25
im
going
to
have
to
go
find
some
more
to
stash
away
for
a
year
or
so
tm
unfortunately
the
taste
misses
the
richness
being
more
a
stringently
bitter
and
less
rich
than
expected
the
tobacco
notes
are
stronger
in
the
taste
and
not
as
smokey
however
i
dont
think
the
taste
itself
is
far
off
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
body
in
the
feel
the
beer
feels
a
bit
light
on
the
tongue
although
the
tobacco
and
bitter
coffee
tastes
do
cling
to
the
mouth
in
a
mildly
oily
way
o
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
better
ontap
than
out
of
the
bottle
not
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
out
there
but
its
worth
going
for
if
youve
got
a
hankering
for
coffee
and
its
the
only
one
on
the
list
love
this
beer
my
absolute
favorite
shelf
stout
although
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
easier
on
the
wallet
pours
dark
brown
with
little
head
great
coffee
smell
taste
is
all
coffee
all
day
some
chocolate
and
vanilla
but
coffee
dominant
moderate
mouthfeel
which
suits
the
flavor
appropriately
not
too
heavy
not
too
thin
just
right
i
love
coffee
stouts
so
this
beer
is
amazing
and
am
actually
surprised
it
doesnt
have
higher
review
scores
seek
it
out
if
you
havent
already
tried
it
another
great
bells
offering
another
fantastic
beer
from
the
gang
at
bells
brewery
puts
most
other
coffeeinfused
beers
to
shame
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
the
pricetag
might
be
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
for
some
but
i
promise
that
if
you
like
coffee
and
beer
and
you
do
this
is
definitely
worth
making
it
rain
in
the
checkout
line
o
the
further
along
i
go
the
more
i
like
it
possibly
due
to
temp
but
i
allowed
it
to
warm
up
a
bit
from
the
breezeway
this
is
good
but
in
direct
comparison
to
lagunitas
cappuccino
stout
it
is
a
close
second
sure
dont
hate
it
o
nice
coffee
forward
stout
for
a
stout
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
recommended
love
bells
keep
up
the
fantastic
work
overall
delicious
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
that
ive
had
easy
drinking
with
an
excellent
flavor
very
assertive
stout
if
i
had
to
describe
with
some
precision
with
one
word
it
would
be
obviously
coffee
overall
solid
coffee
stout
i
was
expecting
more
body
which
maybe
i
shouldnt
have
you
can
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
row
as
usual
a
solid
bells
beer
overall
very
pleased
by
this
and
another
example
of
a
great
stout
done
by
bells
who
has
yet
to
disappoint
me
in
that
category
though
i
have
yet
to
try
the
cherry
stout
at
a
decently
high
7
5
abv
the
alcohol
burn
is
nonexistant
making
this
one
hell
of
a
fun
ride
for
both
coffee
stout
newbies
and
veterans
who
are
looking
for
an
easy
to
drink
one
only
real
complaint
is
its
expensive
at
roughly
14
99
a
6
pack
the
value
compared
to
founders
breakfast
stout
isnt
quite
as
great
still
a
highly
interesting
beer
though
overall
this
is
a
very
good
stout
if
you
like
coffee
stouts
this
is
a
very
good
one
7
5
abv
but
doest
drink
like
it
very
smooth
before
i
know
it
the
glass
is
empty
will
defiantly
drink
again
the
only
real
critique
i
have
is
maybe
too
much
coffee
but
what
do
you
expect
from
java
stout
bell
never
seems
to
dissapoint
michigan
knows
how
to
deliver
stouts
and
porters
this
is
a
rather
an
exceptional
coffee
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
available
id
probably
buy
it
again
but
i
might
think
twice
considering
the
17
a
6
pack
price
this
super
fresh
im
imagining
a
4
75
o
overall
a
very
very
good
coffee
stout
i
love
coffee
stouts
and
this
one
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
one
should
taste
like
nice
coffee
taste
that
isnt
over
powering
but
is
definitely
there
nice
sweetness
perfect
mouthfeel
7
5
that
i
have
no
idea
where
they
put
i
can
drink
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
cheers
well
the
label
of
this
beer
pretty
much
says
it
all
java
java
java
if
you
like
coffee
flavored
stouts
this
is
the
beer
for
you
it
pours
smooth
and
dark
with
very
little
foam
which
is
a
nice
deep
brown
it
smells
like
drinking
a
beer
in
a
coffee
bar
and
tastes
like
a
nice
chilled
cup
of
dark
roast
coffee
it
leaves
your
pallet
clean
without
a
bitter
aftertaste
and
leaves
you
wanting
for
more
a
great
coffee
stout
overall
4
25
another
example
of
bells
hitting
something
of
a
standard
out
of
the
park
kind
of
like
two
hearted
its
just
so
easy
to
drink
and
so
approachable
for
having
such
good
full
rich
flavor
and
feel
honestly
this
is
an
underrated
beer
without
a
doubt
and
i
will
most
likely
be
seeking
this
out
again
in
the
future
db
not
sure
if
this
bottle
is
too
old
or
the
batch
is
messed
up
the
sour
isnt
mentioned
by
many
others
which
makes
me
determined
to
find
more
and
taste
it
again
a
very
nice
coffee
aspect
probably
only
for
coffee
lovers
because
of
its
strength
will
try
again
because
my
faith
in
bells
and
my
love
for
coffee
stouts
o
a
solid
coffee
stout
that
is
easy
to
drink
really
looking
forward
to
bells
coming
to
long
island
o
its
pretty
good
but
i
have
been
drinking
nothing
but
top
notch
ris
lately
i
am
not
trying
to
be
a
smartass
but
it
is
hard
to
evaluate
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
good
head
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
pure
coffee
grounds
love
it
the
taste
is
also
strong
on
the
coffee
almost
too
much
so
i
love
strong
coffee
so
i
enjoy
the
flavor
but
i
would
prefer
it
be
balanced
with
something
else
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
a
lingering
coffee
bitterness
overall
a
good
coffee
beer
that
id
like
to
see
with
some
additional
flavors
like
chocolate
smoked
malt
or
barrel
aging
o
heavy
and
bitter
but
almost
watered
down
at
the
same
time
nevertheless
it
is
enjoyable
and
a
great
substitute
for
your
morning
coffee
o
too
much
coffee
for
me
o
a
terrific
stout
that
does
not
disappoint
with
the
coffee
flavor
a
little
too
much
bitter
coffee
and
not
enough
roasted
malts
for
me
however
still
a
good
representation
of
a
coffee
stout
o
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
its
a
tad
too
sweet
for
me
as
i
tend
to
like
bitter
coffee
stouts
but
its
still
pretty
awesome
this
is
definitely
for
those
whole
prefer
sweeter
coffee
stouts
o
overall
a
tasty
beer
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
still
it
delivers
on
what
it
promises
o
great
cold
weather
beer
really
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
it
might
be
a
little
too
straightforward
for
me
to
enjoy
drinking
many
back
to
back
but
picking
up
a
sixer
to
start
the
winter
seems
like
a
good
start
overall
a
tasty
coffee
beer
but
admittedly
onedimensional
certainly
one
that
ill
probably
pick
up
a
bottle
or
two
each
season
but
nothing
mindblowing
there
are
other
coffee
stouts
id
gladly
pick
up
first
based
on
price
and
taste
still
a
solid
offering
from
bells
as
advertised
plenty
of
java
this
beer
is
straightforward
and
in
my
opinion
nails
the
coffee
stout
it
is
just
shy
of
imperial
status
but
on
the
bigger
side
of
american
stouts
side
note
just
realized
the
abv
of
this
is
not
apparent
in
the
profile
of
the
beer
what
so
ever
drinker
be
warned
this
one
is
sneaky
o
a
great
stout
to
have
on
a
cold
snowy
late
afternoon
its
not
really
for
me
still
better
than
a
lot
of
beverages
ive
had
but
if
youre
a
coffee
fanatic
this
might
be
one
for
you
i
cant
mark
it
down
too
much
because
it
still
seems
like
they
hit
what
they
were
aiming
at
with
this
one
feels
soft
and
besides
a
light
bristle
from
a
light
but
coarse
carbonation
almost
velvety
easy
to
drink
due
to
relatively
low
alcohol
presence
o
really
solid
im
glad
a
gave
it
a
shot
one
of
the
better
coffee
stouts
o
reminds
me
very
much
of
founder
breakfast
stout
but
without
the
complementing
sweet
chocolate
notes
and
creaminess
from
the
oatmeal
this
delivers
on
the
coffee
and
a
great
example
what
midwest
brewery
stouts
are
about
big
flavors
imo
there
arent
many
breweries
that
can
hold
a
candle
to
bells
stout
lineup
kinda
wish
they
would
swap
out
the
double
cream
stout
they
put
in
black
note
with
this
othe
best
bells
beer
ive
had
so
far
im
a
sucker
for
coffee
based
stouts
and
this
one
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
the
feel
is
rather
dry
not
astringent
but
almost
like
a
coffee
without
any
additives
it
has
a
neutral
carbonation
level
and
really
moves
through
the
palate
easy
an
extreme
coffee
stout
in
my
eyes
needs
some
more
flavors
to
balance
it
out
o
coffee
beers
arent
really
my
thing
i
love
a
few
of
them
but
this
thing
is
what
it
says
it
has
a
crazy
amount
of
java
character
and
is
more
coffee
flavored
than
stout
flavored
still
a
very
well
crafted
stout
that
im
certain
a
lot
of
people
would
enjoy
definitely
one
that
can
be
broke
out
during
a
big
breakfast
on
a
cold
winter
morning
o
glad
i
tried
not
my
favorite
by
far
glad
i
have
5
more
to
trade
away
bottled
83013
coffee
is
the
predominate
flavor
with
a
medium
body
a
heavier
texture
and
additional
malt
sweetness
higher
malt
billflaked
oats
would
improve
this
beer
from
very
good
to
outstanding
the
coffee
needs
balanced
with
sweetness
to
taste
what
im
talking
about
pour
a
half
and
half
of
java
and
expedition
the
result
is
an
outstanding
coffee
stout
i
for
one
seek
this
out
every
year
its
too
good
to
pass
up
drink
it
fresh
to
really
enjoy
the
coffee
flavor
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
like
the
rest
of
bells
dark
beers
it
is
so
overshadowed
by
expedition
stout
the
taste
is
chocolate
and
malt
up
front
followed
by
the
coffee
flavor
as
it
warms
up
the
coffee
becomes
more
balanced
with
the
chocolate
and
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
has
a
little
heavyness
to
it
and
the
mouthfeel
is
really
good
o
overall
pretty
solid
drinks
easy
enough
with
good
flavors
and
nothing
offensive
about
it
good
coffee
flavor
but
probably
a
bit
one
sided
o
really
good
stout
dominated
by
roast
coffee
characters
great
if
you
like
strong
coffee
overall
this
is
almost
more
coffee
than
beer
if
you
like
black
coffee
you
will
like
this
i
prefer
stones
espresso
irs
over
this
but
i
could
easily
drink
this
every
morning
better
than
lagunitas
cappuccino
stout
maybe
not
for
everyone
but
if
you
like
strong
coffee
flavored
beers
bells
hit
this
one
spot
on
o
a
very
good
coffee
stout
but
was
hoping
for
even
more
from
bells
probably
the
best
craft
brewer
out
there
it
has
grown
on
me
as
i
work
my
way
through
it
an
extremely
pleasurable
beer
rather
heavy
on
the
coffee
dont
be
subtle
go
for
it
the
one
pours
real
dark
but
looks
more
like
good
rootbeer
when
held
to
a
sunny
window
the
head
is
an
inch
tall
but
fades
to
a
thin
film
in
about
a
minute
plenty
of
yeast
particles
settled
out
on
the
bottom
of
my
glass
the
nose
is
bitter
acidic
coffee
and
burnt
barley
super
robust
almost
like
a
pot
of
cold
coffee
a
few
hours
old
and
there
is
a
slight
smoke
character
too
the
flavor
is
balanced
coffee
until
the
finish
when
its
flavors
and
its
acidity
take
over
normally
i
dont
like
acidity
in
coffee
beers
but
in
this
one
it
provides
a
nice
contrast
to
the
big
pillowy
soft
body
and
rolling
carbonation
its
needed
the
alcohol
is
maybe
a
little
higher
than
it
needs
to
be
burns
slightly
with
the
coffee
but
this
is
your
hangover
maker
and
killer
in
one
bottle
probably
better
as
a
first
beer
than
a
last
beer
in
a
session
another
solid
bells
brew
by
all
counts
o
this
is
one
of
the
most
coffee
forward
beers
that
ive
tried
unfortunately
i
think
i
overpowers
some
of
the
chocolaty
roasted
malt
flavors
still
quite
enjoyable
and
a
must
for
those
of
you
that
like
to
drink
your
coffee
dark
roast
and
black
coffee
flavors
are
about
as
strong
as
a
sumatra
coffee
holy
cow
this
is
a
tasty
tasty
beer
its
kind
of
like
taking
espresso
melt
in
a
chocolate
bar
pour
in
a
bada
stout
then
take
it
boil
it
down
put
it
through
a
strainer
then
take
it
and
throw
in
some
carb
tablets
or
force
carbonate
it
then
you
pour
it
in
my
glass
and
then
i
drink
it
thats
a
nice
nice
nice
beer
yah
its
a
big
beer
but
i
love
that
i
can
find
it
in
a
6
pack
poured
this
american
coffee
stout
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
poured
a
black
color
produced
a
thick
tan
head
excellent
retention
and
tons
of
lace
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
the
stout
consisted
of
roasted
grain
and
fresh
roasted
coffee
medium
bodied
a
foundation
of
roasted
grain
coffee
sweet
malt
apple
slight
touch
of
bitter
hops
overall
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
i
have
sampled
better
coffee
stouts
but
this
one
is
enjoyable
two
words
burnt
folgers
0
a
pretty
good
coffee
stout
seeing
as
most
coffee
stouts
are
imperials
it
is
nice
to
have
a
session
able
coffee
stout
that
i
could
have
in
the
morning
as
well
recommended
for
coffee
lovers
overall
this
was
a
nice
stout
strong
with
coffee
it
would
be
much
better
if
it
wasnt
so
thin
overall
great
coffee
stout
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
b
beer
it
sticks
true
to
being
a
coffee
stout
o
very
fun
to
drink
and
not
have
to
give
all
your
attention
to
too
pricey
for
what
it
actually
is
needs
more
body
and
complexity
pours
deep
brownblack
nice
big
kahki
head
on
this
one
spicey
coffee
wafts
off
the
top
like
my
morning
stop
for
caffeine
hints
of
bitter
cocoa
lacing
present
as
the
head
recedes
very
nice
all
coffee
flavor
wow
this
is
great
almost
like
a
cold
cup
of
joe
here
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
right
on
what
it
should
be
very
nice
could
drink
this
all
night
must
pair
this
with
food
sometime
dark
brown
almost
black
with
about
three
fingers
of
light
brown
head
dense
and
creamy
retention
great
lace
nose
of
fresh
roasted
coffee
beans
earthy
and
herbal
taste
has
a
whole
load
of
roast
and
more
coffee
beans
still
some
earth
notes
and
chalk
perhaps
even
some
dark
chocolate
palate
is
lighter
than
id
like
body
is
disappointingly
thin
although
it
appears
to
full
up
as
it
warms
roast
lingers
for
quite
some
time
coffee
quite
prevalent
here
does
well
for
a
straight
up
coffee
stout
o
way
too
thin
and
watered
down
to
be
very
enjoyable
its
like
drinking
cold
coffee
i
wont
be
buying
any
more
overall
i
was
disapointed
with
this
as
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
a
while
its
a
1
trick
pony
in
my
book
its
all
iced
black
coffee
that
misses
on
any
kind
of
balance
now
if
drinking
cold
black
coffee
is
your
thing
then
you
will
love
this
o
everything
about
this
beer
is
big
and
bold
and
this
is
simply
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
i
have
ever
had
seemlessly
blended
and
almost
flawlessly
presented
a
must
for
coffee
lovers
terrific
coffee
beer
here
loads
of
coffee
flavor
very
rich
does
have
a
heavier
price
tag
however
m
thin
body
im
disappointed
this
doesnt
have
a
bit
more
substantial
mouthfeel
to
it
carbonation
is
understated
but
adequate
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
that
bell
has
certainly
improved
over
the
years
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
for
coffee
lovers
a
great
coffee
stout
that
doesnt
warrant
the
price
tag
give
it
a
go
if
you
can
score
a
single
o
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
dark
roast
coffee
beans
so
if
you
are
a
coffee
lover
you
would
probably
like
this
beer
would
pair
perfectly
with
a
big
breakfast
of
bacon
and
eggs
just
great
black
coffee
flavors
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
used
to
drink
it
fairly
regularly
when
i
lived
in
an
area
that
bells
distributed
their
beers
im
a
huge
fan
of
coffee
and
i
really
like
a
big
stout
so
this
is
the
best
of
both
worlds
very
nice
coffeeespresso
flavors
and
smells
with
a
similar
bitterness
to
it
definitely
one
that
i
would
come
back
for
again
and
again
pretty
easy
to
drink
with
the
well
hidden
alcohol
and
the
lightness
in
the
body
i
had
this
on
tap
at
bells
a
while
ago
the
bottled
version
is
not
quite
as
good
but
its
still
a
decent
brew
when
all
is
said
and
done
little
pricey
for
what
youre
getting
though
like
any
other
stout
i
personally
wouldnt
drink
this
one
too
often
but
its
a
great
everynowandthen
beer
nice
black
with
with
a
brown
mahogany
tint
smells
like
a
cup
of
joe
with
roasted
malts
taste
really
coffee
like
but
not
sharp
or
crisp
on
the
coffee
bitter
and
roasted
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
soft
carbonation
overall
a
nice
coffee
stout
but
definitely
not
the
best
i
would
recommend
but
not
ahead
of
some
greater
brews
othe
coffee
was
nice
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
too
much
of
it
poor
balance
o
this
is
a
good
stout
especially
if
you
like
coffee
it
only
has
a
little
bit
of
the
sweet
chocolate
and
vanilla
flavors
that
can
be
found
in
stouts
but
it
has
a
ton
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
what
can
you
expect
from
a
beer
thats
called
java
stout
its
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
in
stouts
but
it
still
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
another
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
from
bells
b
this
is
a
very
tasty
coffee
flavored

smooth

enjoyable
offering
note
i
had
a
beer
like
this
last
night
dark
horses
perkulator
dopplebock
the
two
were
very
similar
in
their
presentation
of
coffee
but
i
must
say
dark
horse
wins
this
one
im
not
sure
ill
buy
java
stout
again
this
is
simply
a
straight
forward
coffee
stout
it
has
solid
flavor
and
great
drinkability
ultimately
there
is
little
beyond
balance
that
separates
this
beer
from
the
other
coffee
stouts
out
there
but
for
anyone
who
likes
the
style
this
is
a
must
try
o
im
not
a
huge
coffee
person
but
i
tried
to
review
this
objectively
anyway
i
think
it
is
really
good
for
a
coffee
stout
it
has
a
vivid
coffee
aroma
and
taste
the
beer
also
looks
wonderful
in
the
glass
i
was
disappointed
in
the
mouthfeel
pours
a
rich
blackish
brown
color
with
an
off
white
light
tan
head
strong
nose
of
perfumy
alcohol
roasted
malts
and
just
a
touch
of
coffee
smells
like
an
aged
russian
imperial
stout
in
the
flavor
roasted
malts
black
acidic
coffee
and
a
touch
of
dark
soy
sauce
as
it
warms
some
vanilla
notes
come
out
and
the
firm
maltyness
takes
over
cocoa
nibs
black
coffee
smoky
malts
and
alcohol
make
up
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
well
carbonated
and
smooth
overall
this
coffee
stout
is
pretty
good
at
about
a
year
old
but
since
its
coffee
bill
is
so
strong
i
recommend
consuming
it
fresh
the
flavors
dont
really
improve
with
age
medium
body
decent
carbonation
chewy
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
definitely
a
quality
coffee
beer
that
doesnt
become
too
sweet
or
too
bitter
id
definitely
drink
this
again
overall
im
very
disappointed
with
this
i
expected
a
lot
more
there
is
no
balance
if
you
like
your
coffee
black
and
cold
you
might
like
this
im
having
trouble
finishing
it
its
that
bitter
overall
another
great
beer
from
bells
flavor
is
more
roasty
coffee
beans
with
a
mild
hint
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
booziness
at
the
finish
overall
a
perfectly
tasty
blend
of
coffee
and
dark
stout
and
possibly
the
best
melding
of
the
two
ive
ever
had
o
now
this
is
coffee
stout
to
me
it
is
better
than
the
expedition
and
double
cream
all
three
are
good
but
this
one
stands
alone
this
is
what
i
want
in
a
coffee
stout
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
pours
black
as
ebony
with
no
head
but
some
residual
lacing
smell
is
overwhelming
coffee
mouthfeel
is
great
with
a
surprising
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
beer
of
this
type
taste
is
what
a
stout
should
be
i
love
that
strong
black
coffee
taste
as
it
is
the
dominant
flavor
i
highly
recommend
this
one
if
you
are
a
fan
of
stouts
o
bells
has
yet
to
disappoint
and
this
is
no
exception
a
nice
american
stout
that
lives
up
to
its
name
o
a
pretty
good
beer
strong
simple
flavor
the
problem
for
me
not
being
a
huge
black
coffee
lover
is
that
the
coffee
flavor
was
too
strong
andwhile
the
first
couple
of
sips
were
really
good
it
didnt
have
enough
interest
to
keep
me
wanting
to
drink
the
entire
glass
bottled
on
91411
so
its
basically
a
ten
month
old
coffee
stout
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
clear
plastic
hotel
cup
dark
black
body
with
an
ugly
greyish
mocha
head
solid
lacing
and
retention
smell
is
roasted
malt
and
black
coffee
taste
is
roasted
malts
light
salty
smoke
and
smooth
coffee
its
not
a
dark
roast
or
an
espresso
its
just
a
basic
run
of
the
mill
black
coffee
very
light
bitterness
finishes
cleanly
with
lingering
coffee
notes
its
simplistic
but
very
effective
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
smooth
even
aged
this
beer
has
a
solid
coffee
presence
damn
tasty

thanks
to
egadbananas
for
this
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
dark
brown
with
a
two
finger
length
creamy
tan
head
that
dissipates
slowly
some
ruby
red
can
be
seen
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
some
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
the
head
dissipates
there
are
aromas
of
dark
roasted
barley
malt
strong
coffee
and
mild
chocolate
it
smells
sweet
the
taste
follows
the
nose
there
are
strong
flavors
of
coffee
and
roasted
barley
malt
theres
chocolate
and
molasses
the
flavors
are
full
and
robust
the
alcohol
is
not
present
in
the
flavor
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
adequate
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
an
excellent
beer
while
the
body
is
on
the
lower
end
for
imperial
stouts
this
is
by
no
means
a
point
against
this
beer
try
this
one
if
you
can
find
it
ill
just
say
it
this
is
not
an
imperial
stout
it
kind
of
approaches
territory
of
an
imperial
stout
but
it
doesnt
entirely
fit
the
bill
if
you
go
into
drinking
this
thinking
that
it
is
going
to
be
a
heavy
imperial
stout
you
will
be
disappointed
if
youre
expecting
a
regular
american
stout
with
a
strong
coffee
flavor
youll
wont
be
disappointed
this
beer
is
actually
quite
sessionable
i
sessioned
it
last
night
as
a
matter
of
fact
pretty
good
almost
on
par
with
fbs
not
sure
why
fbs
gets
so
much
hype
compared
to
this
beer
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
wine
glass
the
label
on
the
bottle
has
a
funny
cartoon
character
anyhow
the
body
of
it
pours
a
near
black
with
very
little
hear
a
ring
soon
sits
atop
smell
has
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
taking
a
sip
of
this
and
i
taste
roasted
malts
quite
a
bit
of
dark
roast
coffee
and
some
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
velvetlike
with
a
bittersweet
finish
this
is
fine
doublecoffee
stout
and
i
am
glad
that
i
picked
this
up
a
few
weeks
ago
when
i
was
in
philly
another
treat
kevin
hooked
up
poured
from
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
dark
black
with
brown
edges
in
the
light
with
a
decent
1
finger
mocha
colored
head
has
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
coffee
dominated
behind
the
coffee
is
roasted
malt
bakers
chocolate
and
just
enough
alcohol
warmth
to
remind
you
this
is
an
imperial
similarly
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
coffee
from
start
to
finish
the
roast
chocolate
and
mild
bitterness
play
2nd
fiddle
but
also
provide
a
nice
flavor
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
finishes
dry
with
a
lingering
coffee
flavor
overall
this
was
a
treat
a
bit
too
aggressive
with
the
coffee
in
my
opinion
but
still
good
poured

a
bit
of
a

coffee
smell
which
was
distracting
taste
follows
the
nose
with
that
heavy
coffee
punch
initially
and
then
fading
to
some
butterscotch
and
dark

not
a
huge
fan
of
the
big
coffee
stouts
but
this
was
not
too
over
the

on

decent

feel
was
nice
and

not

is
pretty
damn
good
i
i
think
its
really
hard
to
mess
up
a
coffee
stout
this
one
has
been
mastered
the
feel
alone
is
heavenly
o
jesus
cofffeee
not
my
thing
recommended
if
you
like
your
coffee
black
otherwise
no
overall
one
of
the
better
coffee
stouts
good
brew
didnt
blow
me
away
but
it
has
flavor
and
is
quite
drinkable
o
not
bad
at
all
but
nothing
outstanding
about
it
a
solid
brew
worth
a
try
although
the
java
focus
doesnt
quite
come
through
the
roasty
flavours
overall
not
terribly
impressed
but
not
bad
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
flavor
complexity
other
than
just
the
coffee
profile
o
i
find
this
to
be
a
terrific
brew
and
bells
has
done
a
nice
job
of
balancing
out
the
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
those
subtle
hop
and
alcohol
create
a
bit
more
balance
and
helps
draw
the
taste
buds
away
from
the
coffee
grounds
this
one
is
kind
of
steep
on
the
price
but
i
find
it
worthy
of
a
repurchase
appearance
is
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
generous
tan
head
scents
of
coffee
and
cocoa
are
pleasant
and
strong
with
a
stronger
lean
toward
the
cocoa
scent
than
coffee
the
taste
follows
the
nose
but
with
a
bit
more
coffee
taste
than
cocoa
solid
mouthfeel
all
around
a
good
stout
especially
if
you
like
coffee
the
aroma
of
java
is
strong
and
the
drink
and
aftertaste
matches
it
tenfold
which
is
not
true
among
most
others
of
this
kind
if
you
like
stouts
and
you
like
coffee
and
are
interested
in
breaking
into
this
kind
of
beer
then
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
o
yet
another
winner
from
bells
and
a
standup
coffee
stout
with
a
well
hidden
abv
kick
easily
drinkable
and
nicely
balanced
between
the
bitter
and
sweet
highly
recommended
o
this
is
the
most
coffeeforward
beer
i
have
tried
most
other
coffee
stouts
i
have
tried
use
the
coffee
to
blend
in
with
roasted
malt
and
other
flavors
this
one
hits
you
from
beginning
to
end
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
but
different
overall
a
very
enjoyable
stout
which
is
true
to
its
name
as
a
java
stout
a
little
more
bitter
than
founders
and
lacking
some
of
the
latters
complexity
overall
this
is
one
nice
affordable
coffee
stout
one
to
try
over
and
over
again
and
have
on
many
of
occasions
tastemouthfeel
good
full
flavor
of
espresso
and
semisweet
chocolate
in
the
front
before
finishing
nice
and
clean
the
7
5
abv
is
not
in
evidence
at
all
making
this
an
easy
drinking
stout
bells
has
always
been
solid
when
it
comes
to
stout
and
this
does
not
disappoint
overall
a
very
good
coffee
stout
better
than
average
but
not
mind
blowing
this
beer
is
damn
tasty
o
this
is
a
well
constructed
coffee
stout
that
is
quite
enjoyable
i
normally
turn
to
founders
or
central
waters
for
my
stouts
but
this
beer
deserves
to
be
part
of
my
rotation
pours
a
midnight
black
with
a
onefinger
brown
head
goes
away
without
making
too
much
of
a
fuss
wow
has
as
strong
of
a
coffee
nose
as
any
stout
ive
tried
pure
strong
espresso
and
dark
roast
coffee
beans
coffee
tails
off
in
the
flavor
but
still
pronounced
and
stronge
roasted
coffee
notes
not
a
sweet
coffee
like
many
other
coffee
flavored
beers
but
a
black
espresso
vibe
nice
milk
chocolate
sweetness
to
kill
some
of
the
bittering
coffee
at
the
finish
this
is
a
beer
for
coffee
lovers
not
lovers
of
coffee
flavored
things
i
can
see
how
it
might
be
offputting
to
some
and
has
a
onenote
flavor
profile
but
there
is
definitely
room
for
this
coffee
specialty
stout
its
a
good
coffee
stout
id
get
again
if
available
in
ny
overall
i
seldom
rate
coffee
stouts
very
highly
this
one
was
no
different
above
average
as
it
had
no
offensive
flavors
but
nothing
terribly
interesting
o
i
generally
love
bells
beers
but
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
ive
tried
unbalanced
thin
and
not
particularly
pleasant
maybe
just
an
offbatch
o
overall
fantastic
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
coffee
stout
i
wish
that
i
had
regular
access
to
it
definitely
a
buy
again
if
i
could
o
i
was
a
bit
thrown
off
by
the
smell
honestly
but
then
tasted
it
and
i
now
know
why
i
really
like
bells
brewery
their
stouts
they
got
this
down
to
a
t
much
like
two
hearted
this
is
something
i
want
on
a
frequent
basis
alas
such
a
desire
is
only
a
dream
this
is
not
a
mindblowing
coffee
beer
but
its
tasty
and
wellrounded
overall
a
solid
coffee
stout
it
has
its
problems
but
its
solid
4
0

jet
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
coffee
and
a
nice
roast
in
the
taste
dry
coffee
and
nice
bitterness
a
coffee
bitterness
and
a
medium
to
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
coffee
like
aftertaste
nice
coffee
presence
a
bit
sweeter
in
the
nose
but
very
nice
o
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
one
of
my
go
to
beers
in
the
winter
this
coming
sunday
i
will
literally
go
to
church
and
pray
to
the
lord
to
convince
bells
brewery
to
make
this
a
year
round
beer
it
is
fantastic
o
damn
solid
stout
ive
really
come
to
love
this
style
this
is
a
notch
below
fbs
for
me
but
overall
quite
good
i
think
im
finally
finished
with
this
beer
ive
tried
it
several
times
at
different
temperatures
and
after
different
meals
now
ive
let
one
sit
for
a
while
i
have
given
it
every
opportunity
since
i
respect
bells
brewery
so
very
much
and
i
am
convinced
that
i
just
dont
think
it
stands
up
to
some
of
the
other
coffee
stouts
ive
had
its
good
but
i
cant
quite
put
it
on
my
top
shelf
overall
a
very
enjoyable
stout
more
so
obviously
if
you
love
coffee
not
the
best
ive
had
but
i
would
certainly
not
be
averse
to
more
o
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
the
taste
was
very
onedimensional
and
the
thin
mouthfeel
is
something
i
cannot
put
aside
finally
getting
down
to
retrying
this
guy
and
putting
my
thoughts
to
words
posterity
maybe
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
very
dark
blackbrown
with
very
deep
ruby
highlights
all
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
tan
foam
the
nose
is
primarily
a
playground
for
nutty
coffee
though
a
touch
of
roast
vainly
attempts
to
peek
through
the
beany
fog
the
taste
continues
this
trend
though
the
roast
still
relatively
faint
stands
a
bit
stronger
than
it
once
did
nasally
speaking
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
dry
finish
overall
a
onetrick
pony
that
has
honed
his
trick
decidedly
well
not
necessarily
toptier
but
close
to
it
o
i
gave
this
beer
straight
4s
it
has
a
fantastic
coffee
flavor
that
is
at
once
intense
and
still
lingers
very
nicely
a
well
done
beer
if
you
have
ever
had
chocolate
covered
espresso
beans
good
ones
that
is
the
closest
thing
to
describe
the
flavor
on
this
one
o
this
is
a
very
good
stout
tons
of
coffee
flavors
and
a
unique
bite
to
it
will
probably
buy
again
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
good
coffeeforward
stout
if
thats
the
kind
of
thing
youre
looking
for
legit
coffee
flavors
and
just
the
right
amount
of
bitter
and
roastiness
to
keep
it
an
easy
drinker
o
a
good
coffee
beer
and
one
i
would
love
to
have
again
o
a
very
good
stout
with
no
booze
scents
very
pleasing
aroma
and
taste
o
pretty
decent
coffee
stout
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
java
pours
deep
and
dark
2
finger
light
tan
head
nice
to
look
at
head
was
gone
quick
along
with
light
lacing
smell
is
sweet
but
all
coffee
taste
is
all
roasted
coffee
beans
black
earthy
a
touch
of
maltiness
peaking
in
the
back
dry
java
finish
its
definitely
all
java
here
in
and
out
no
sign
of
alcohol
or
hops
drier
thinner
stout
body
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
not
my
style
though
was
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
7
5
abv
beer
might
give
it
a
shot
as
the
first
beet
of
the
night
better
for
winter
months
not
to
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
overall
i
love
my
coffee
and
i
love
beers
when
the
two
are
put
together
the
results
can
be
really
good
i
did
enjoy
this
one
but
i
think
it
might
have
benefited
from
some
balancing
sweetness
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
ive
had
this
a
time
or
two
before
and
have
enjoyed
it
theres
no
difference
this
time
around
im
thoroughly
impressed
by
bells
stouts
and
java
stout
fits
in
just
fine
recommended
overall
more
coffee
than
stout
really
pretty
disappointed
especially
considering
what
i
know
bells
can
achieve
they
have
many
stouts
that
blow
this
out
of
the
water
though
it
does
emulate
coffee
well
too
well
o
considering
the
repuation
well
deserved
of
the
brewery
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
one
coffee
dominant
but
bitter
and
a
bit
thin
i
would
certainly
not
turn
my
nose
up
at
this
one
but
i
would
probably
choose
a
different
selection
next
time
thebeeralmanac
com
o
decent
coffee
stout
but
nothing
too
special
about
this
one
for
about
the
same
price
expedition
is
by
far
a
better
beer
this
is
as
close
to
coffee
as
beer
gets
only
with
a
thicker
mouthfeel
and
since
i
love
coffee
i
like
this
beer
and
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
even
if
no
particular
area
stands
out
as
exceptional
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
1
finger
tan
head
the
smell
is
coffee
loads
of
it
and
a
little
sweetness
and
roastiness
the
taste
is
a
lot
of
coffee
with
a
little
roastiness
and
sweetness
but
not
well
balanced
between
beer
and
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
sa
little
thinner
than
expected
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
something
i
would
go
after
again
with
the
other
coffee
beers
out
there
o
a
good
coffee
beer
with
a
huge
coffee
flavor
but
there
are
better
coffee
beers
out
there
very
happy
i
got
to
try
this
but
i
wouldnt
take
the
time
to
hunt
it
down
again
kind
of
reminds
me
of
péché
mortel
but
the
coffee
beans
used
in
java
stout
are
not
as
good
o
a
very
nice
beer
not
sure
that
it
fits
in
with
the
larger
ris
but
standing
on
its
own
as
a
stout
i
really
like
it
not
complex
but
flavors
are
rich
enough
to
make
up
for
it
this
one
is
opaque
and
almost
completely
black
tan
head
at
the
corners
of
the
glass
smells
of
chocolate
and
strong
java
coffee
the
smell
reminds
me
of
coffee
from
starbucks
tastes
of
strong
coffee
some
chocolate
some
sweetness
followed
by
a
strong
bitter
coffee
flavor
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
smooth
nicely
carbonated
i
love
having
coffee
stouts
on
brew
day
although
very
nicely
done
i
prefer
fbs
overall
to
be
honest
ive
come
to
expect
a
bit
more
from
bells
its
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
at
all
memorable
for
its
styleclass
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
mediumlow
carbonation
seems
a
bit
more
like
beer
coffee
than
coffee
beer
but
i
liked
it
just
the
same
massive
coffee
bomb
on
the
tongue
as
it
rushes
to
the
back
of
my
throat
espresso
galore
lingering
bitter
coffee
as
it
descends
surprisingly
thin
body
detracts
from
the
experience
absolutely
imbalanced
but
i
happen
to
like
it
pretty
sure
this
wasnt
an
old
bottle
so
i
think
bells
just
overdid
it
on
this
one
may
have
gotten
a
little
cocky
ha
overall
not
a
fan
the
coffee
flavor
is
overboard
and
not
very
flavorful
no
balance
just
java
bomb
and
not
very
good
java
at
that
one
finger
head
in
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
near
black
brew
with
some
retention
and
little
lacing
smell
is
coffee
and
burnt
malt
and
the
taste
follows
the
nose
medium
body
with
little
carbonation
it
is
dry
and
bitter
with
some
vanilla
and
chocolate
notes
a
very
nice
brew
overall
really
a
nice
and
balanced
java
stout
lots
of
roasted
coffee
and
perfect
dryness
to
keep
you
sipping
overall
almost
too
aggressive
on
the
coffee
i
can
only
imagine
what
fresh
must
do
im
pretty
sure
its
coffee
with
a
time
lapse
maltalcohol
tab
that
dissolves
over
a
2
week
bottle
condition
nice
but
definitely
a
bit
overbalanced
on
the
coffee
the
taste
is
malty
and
full
of
coffee
it
also
has
some
caramel
and
vanilla
but
just
a
touch
it
is
robust
and
reminds
me
of
a
heavily
roasted
bean
truly
enjoyable
first
review
for
me
cant
get
over
the
overwhelming
tastearoma
of
generic
coffee
beans
seriously
mouth
feel
appearance
etc
are
all
put
aside
due
to
being
a
coffee
snob
as
well
the
taste
was
like
drinking
a
mixture
of
some
crappy
coffee
like
choc
full
of
nuts
and
carbonation
if
you
like
drinking
gas
station
coffee
then
you
might
enjoy
the
heartiness
the
texture
is
actually
what
i
would
expect
from
a
fullbodied
brew
and
low
head
with
slow
tracing
would
all
be
appealing
if
i
didnt
have
to
deal
with
aforementioned
crap
coffee
taste
and
aftertaste
d
this
is
a
sipper
i
love
to
examine
how
this
beer
changes
over
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
update
waited
another
4
weeks
to
try
another
one
of
the
original
6
pack
and
time
has
been
good
to
this
brew
the
alcohol
bite
is
entirely
gone
nice
chocolate
and
lightly
bitter
coffee
notes
medium
mouthfee
and
a
scrupteoush
beer
this
is
a
definate
a
brew
once
it
has
bottle
conditioned
for
a
while
5
weeks
in
my
case
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
lot
like
founders
breakfast
stout
in
my
opinion
this
should
be
enjoyed
late
afternoon
or
after
dinner
but
if
you
dare
you
could
surely
replace
your
morning
cup
of
joe
with
this
a
must
try
for
a
coffee
stout
lover
o
this
beer
pure
awesomeness
i
love
coffee
beers
and
this
beer
has
what
i
need
igredient
heavy
and
well
balanced
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
out
there
o
a
solid
beer
overall
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
bells
drinkability
is
good
for
such
a
rich
brew
not
quite
as
smooth
or
refined
as
some
of
the
better
known
coffee
stouts
out
there
but
still
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
very
decent
beer
if
you
love
super
dark
roast
coffee
and
slightly
burnt
notes
in
your
beer
i
prefer
other
coffee
stouts
but
i
would
never
turn
this
one
down
it
is
simple
but
it
makes
up
for
that
by
having
a
robust
taste
if
you
love
dark
roasted
coffee
try
this
beer
out
bells
says
damn
it
all
and
just
loads
you
up
on
coffee
it
is
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
some
stout
with
your
coffee
o
good
coffee
stout
but
i
prefer
mine
a
little
bolder
in
many
aspects
but
this
is
easy
drinking
compared
to
many
cost
15
99
for
a
six
pack
overall
it
is
a
very
good
straightforward
coffee
stout
o
this
is
a
nice
combination
of
coffee
and
stout
but
a
bit
intense
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
the
coffee
flavor
really
comes
out
well
and
it
balances
nicely
with
the
malt
would
only
recommend
if
you
like
coffee
if
coffee
is
your
thing
this
is
a
good
stout
i
prefer
something
like
founders
breakfast
as
a
more
balanced
coffee
flavor
good
beer
o
i
was
hoping
this
beer
would
taste
better
fresh
but
i
was
wrong
it
tastes
like
burnt
coffee
with
some
faint
dark
chocolate
flavor
im
not
sure
what
bells
was
trying
to
do
here
overall
not
my
cup
of
coffee
i
guess
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
but
not
up
to
the
aforementioned
coffee
stouts
imo
what
a
nice
stout
pours
black
with
a
nice
thickness
creamy
espressocolored
head
smells
like
roasted
malts
and
spent
coffee
grinds
in
a
good
way
taste
is
smooth
and
surprisingly
not
bitter
earthy
hops
present
nice
and
full
coating
and
oily
this
is
good
stuff
overall
a
solid
coffee
lovers
stout
me
thinks
they
should
have
put
coffee
brewed
with
beer
on
the
lable
12oz
bottle
pours
a
pitch
black
heavy
looking
liquid
with
coarse
finger
of
mocha
head
clinging
to
the
snifter
the
aroma
is
a
coffee
explosion
burnt
chocolate
roasted
coffee
beans
tobacco
leaves
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
of
bold
guatemalan
coffee
bean
a
light
hop
presence
a
very
bitter
dark
charred
chocolate
taste
finishes
up
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
presence
and
the
body
is
less
filling
than
what
meets
the
eye
but
medium
to
full
overly
carbonated
which
creates
a
smoothness
equivalent
to
the
back
of
a
fat
chicks
legs
rocky
like
mogul
just
not
very
smooth
perhaps
age
could
round
some
things
out
and
calm
the
coffee
down
this
beer
is
not
very
good
and
bells
continues
to
disappoint
thanks
for
nothin
d
ill
crush
fbs
overall
this
isnt
too
bad
but
its
surprisingly
a
little
underwhelming
and
if
i
could
describe
the
beer
with
one
word
it
would
be
flat
out
of
the
bottle
this
really
didnt
deliver
but
i
could
certainly
drink
this
again
but
probably
not
at
the
price
they
charge
for
it
mouthfeel
is
just
above
medium
bodied
with
slightly
above
average
carbonation
not
quite
smooth
enough
for
me
not
all
that
easy
to
drink
either
overall
a
decent
stout
im
going
to
let
a
few
of
these
sit
for
a
while
and
see
how
they
turn
out
another
decent
stout
from
bells
but
still
havent
seen
the
great
one
not
worth
the
16
a
6er
but
oh
well
its
called
java
for
a
reason
dark
brown
color
no
light
penetrates
it
a
quarter
inch
of
tan
foam
floats
atop
the
beer
for
a
moment
then
dissipates
leaving
thin
lacing
the
nose
is
coffee
and
milk
chocolate
taste
is
big
coffee
up
front
followed
by
silky
milk
chocolate
and
a
mildly
roasty
malt
profile
more
coffee
in
the
finish
which
is
dry
with
a
slight
diactyl
aftertaste
feel
is
somewhat
full
bodied
with
a
low
but
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
a
nice
example
of
a
coffee
stout
perhaps
not
as
complex
as
some
others
but
a
solid
offering
nonetheless
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
of
all
the
coffee
stouts
i
have
tried
this
one
retains
its
coffee
flavors
among
the
best
of
em
and
for
the
longest
time
which
is
what
ranks
it
in
the
upper
echelon
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
like
chewing
on
a
coffee
bean
whilst
stout
beer
coats
the
mouth
and
no
ordinary
coffee
bean
either
a
deeply
roasted
bean
it
smells
delightful
coffee
aromas
abound
but
the
taste
is
less
satisfying
pungent
flavor
an
unbalanced
attempt
at
a
java
brew
overall
this
is
great
beer
lots
of
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
not
hard
on
the
wallet
bells
makes
good
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
2
inch
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
very
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
beans
and
cocoa
powder
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
dusted
coffeeespresso
beans
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
coffee
stout
and
probably
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
tried
im
very
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
o
the
7
5
isnt
really
noticeable
pretty
easy
drinking
hard
to
not
compare
this
with
fbs
falls
short
of
fbs
in
pretty
much
every
category
but
still
a
well
made
and
enjoyable
stout
o
if
you
love
coffee
stouts
this
is
the
place
to
go
its
onedimensional
but
i
love
the
coffee
aspect
so
i
found
it
to
be
a
tasty
beer
i
rather
like
this
one
when
it
was
cold
the
roastiness
was
a
little
overpowering
almost
smelled
like
burnt
coffee
but
as
it
is
warming
its
developing
into
something
really
delicious
roast
coffee
with
an
almost
kahlualike
richness
really
good
black
in
body
with
off
white
head
that
dissipates
aroma
of
chocolate
coffee
with
milk
cinnamon
and
some
earth
tastes
of
chocolate
dark
coffee
some
strong
cinnamon
cola
and
booze
heavy
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
a
mediocre
coffee
stout
with
unbalanced
flavors
this
beer
is
as
advertised
i
dont
know
if
i
can
really
fault
it
on
the
taste
for
tasting
like
black
coffee
i
will
say
that
i
thought
it
was
a
little
one
dimensional
but
definitely
not
bad
tasting
its
spot
on
as
far
as
coffee
goes
the
rest
of
this
beer
was
spot
on
definitely
worth
trying
especially
if
you
are
a
coffee
lover
this
is
an
almost
beer
almost
great
its
like
an
ingredient
away
i
still
recommend
it
i
will
drink
it
when
offered
i
will
even
by
it
from
time
to
time
but
candidly
this
doesnt
even
scratch
the
surface
of
my
great
stouts
list
o
a
very
solid
choice
one
i
wish
i
could
have
again
my
only
regret
is
that
i
have
yet
to
find
this
on
tap
as
i
believe
it
would
be
even
better
o
a
decent
coffee
stout
for
me
a
better
than
average
coffee
stout
i
cant
really
pick
out
any
aspect
of
it
that
blows
me
away
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
an
imperial
stout
but
i
almost
feel
like
coffee
stouts
are
a
style
unto
themselves
with
abvs
all
over
the
place
so
i
wont
hold
this
against
java
im
a
coffee
lover
so
i
like
this
one
very
much
hope
to
get
my
hands
on
as
many
as
possible
while
theyre
available
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
oddly
enough
i
am
getting
both
burnt
and
sweet
notes
in
the
nose
there
is
definitely
no
sweet
flavor
here
it
is
wholesome
stout
bitterness
with
a
trace
of
coffee
the
finish
is
a
bit
flat
but
the
overall
flavor
profile
is
robust
this
fits
my
general
feeling
about
bells
beers
they
are
solid
and
well
above
average
beers
but
none
are
extraordinary
o
the
refermentation
or
whatever
makes
this
beer
pretty
undrinkable
after
a
few
sips
the
novelty
of
a
sour
coffee
beer
wears
off
i
tried
this
beer
for
the
first
time
a
few
months
ago
and
wasnt
impressed
now
the
second
time
around
its
even
worse
do
i
feel
like
java
stout
could
benefit
in
using
highergrade
java
weird
thing
to
say
but
i
think
i
prefer
my
coffee
stout
homebrew
better
its
really
a
like
it
or
leave
it
polarizing
beer
as
can
be
seen
throughout
these
reviews
o
not
a
bad
stout
at
all
so
i
gave
it
a
slightly
higher
overall
to
pick
it
up
a
little
good
brew
but
pretty
one
dimensional
o
reminds
me
of
a
stale
french
press
coffee
i
was
not
crazy
about
this
i
am
looking
at
my
past
reviews
and
it
looks
as
if
i
dont
like
coffee
stouts
but
i
swear
here
are
quite
a
few
that
i
do
like
this
is
just
not
one
of
them
most
beers
try
to
walk
the
tightrope
between
one
flavor
and
the
next
greatly
concerned
at
the
prospect
of
an
overbearing
flavor
this
is
not
one
of
those
beers
although
i
generally
like
beers
i
had
no
idea
as
to
just
how
strong
the
java
flavor
of
this
one
would
be
i
generally
like
milk
and
sugar
with
my
coffee
admittedly
but
i
can
tolerate
coffee
black
from
time
to
time
the
bells
java
stout
however
has
a
stronger
coffee
flavor
than
coffee
itself
so
my
recommendation
if
you
are
a
coffee
fiend
this
may
just
be
your
holy
grail
if
you
are
beerstout
fiend
though
you
may
want
to
give
this
order
a
second
or
third
thought
this
is
a
drinkable
stout
especially
if
you
love
quality
coffee
goes
well
with
desserts
overall
pass
just
a
huge
miss
as
far
as
coffee
beers
or
any
beer
for
that
matter
goes
i
dont
plan
on
finishing
this
even
though
its
already
mainly
gone
wow
bells
continues
to
disappoint
me
beer
after
beer
smooth
mouthfeels
reminded
me
of
an
oatmeal
stout
as
it
warmed
decent
drinkability
this
stout
poured
out
as
a
deep
rich
brown
color
the
head
was
light
brown
on
top
the
lacing
wasnt
too
great
on
this
one
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
good
amount
of
coffee
on
the
nose
the
coffee
was
probably
the
entire
aroma
that
this
beer
had
in
my
opinion
other
than
the
roasted
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
wasnt
too
bad
but
i
felt
that
the
coffee
flavors
were
a
little
weak
when
comparing
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
id
drink
it
again
overall
like
i
said
one
of
my
favorite
beers
out
there
right
now
and
easily
a
top
coffee
stout
i
would
recommend
this
one
strongly
to
anyone
looking
to
try
bells
or
coffee
stouts
for
the
first
time
one
of
the
better
bells
beers
i
have
tried
and
a
solid
coffee
stout
in
general
i
have
however
received
an
infect
bottle
of
this
before
worth
trying
not
something
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
though
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
tend
to
like
beers
that
go
along
with
their
genre
with
maybe
a
little
something
extra
and
though
this
wouldnt
necessarily
be
a
go
to
beer
it
was
overall
excellent
my
pour
was
even
more
impressive
in
its
result
than
bells
extra
special
stout
the
last
one
i
reviewed
prior
to
this
two
dense
fingers
of
deeptan
head
with
excellent
retention
color
was
an
ebony
black
allowing
zero
light
penetration
nose
was
really
roasty
reminding
me
why
i
shied
away
from
it
lo
those
many
years
ago
it
was
somewhere
between
colombian
and
french
roast
in
its
roastiness
and
both
of
those
are
still
ones
that
i
add
to
a
simple
original
blend
either
one
on
their
own
and
i
could
be
hooked
up
to
a
generator
for
the
day
that
is
to
give
you
an
idea
of
intensity
on
top
of
which
we
are
talking
7
5
abv
this
is
not
a
beer
for
the
faint
of
heart
mouthfeel
was
unbelievably
full
and
creamy
and
one
of
us
had
mellowed
in
terms
of
taste
either
it
had
come
down
or
i
have
elevated
or
perhaps
both
but
it
was
still
pretty
intense
in
terms
of
its
darkroasted
coffee
flavor
and
the
difference
was
that
i
found
it
very
enjoyable
i
think
that
i
was
really
on
a
hops
kick
back
then
and
this
just
did
not
taste
right
to
me
at
the
time
the
lacing
that
was
beginning
to
appear
looked
like
it
would
take
a
jackhammer
to
remove
later
finish
was
like
finishing
a
demitasse
of
cappuccino
i
kid
you
not
you
had
really
better
like
intense
coffee
not
just
simply
a
cuppa
joe
or
this
is
not
going
to
be
your
cup
of
tea
so
to
speak
oh
my
heart
drinkability
a
readily
available
brew
that
has
the
depth
and
character
to
hold
up
the
best
of
them
great
stuff
o
ump
ok
o
this
one
isnt
try
to
hide
what
it
is
but
i
think
it
might
be
a
little
confused
as
a
coffee
lover
i
am
obviously
drawn
to
strong
coffee
flavors
when
i
choose
to
drink
a
coffee
stout
its
my
way
of
combining
my
love
for
beer
with
my
love
for
coffee
in
this
case
i
find
myself
wanting
to
finish
this
one
off
so
i
can
open
up
a
beer
overall
solid
stout
but
not
mind
blowing
i
let
this
one
warm
up
thinking
i
may
pull
more
flavor
characteristics
but
it
remains
the
same
dark
chocolate
dominant
not
much
complexity
just
a
really
good
tasting
stout
mo
i
m
not
a
great
fan
of
imperial
stouts
but
this
one
really
drinkable
and
not
just
a
cold
weather
beer
o
a
very
focused
coffee
beer
good
quality
coffee
tasty
beer
would
have
this
one
again
for
sure
o
this
is
a
very
good
stout
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
o
all
in
all
this
one
came
out
of
left
field
for
me
phenomenal
coffee
stout
so
creamy
and
bold
with
the
flavors
yet
all
flavors
work
so
well
together
once
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
i
have
had
if
you
like
stouts
with
big
flavor
and
coffee
then
this
is
right
up
your
alley
way
to
go
bells
overall
a
great
coffee
stout
coffee
flavor
dominates
and
is
very
tasty
even
for
someone
who
is
not
much
of
a
coffee
drinker
like
me
pours
dark
coffee
color
with
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
tan
foam
minimal
lacing
smell
is
foremost
a
mediumroast
coffee
with
some
nice
roasted
chocolate
malt
notes
the
coffee
comes
to
dominate
the
taste
although
i
still
get
a
hint
of
malt
with
a
pretty
smooth
slightly
bitter
long
finish
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
carbonation
and
body
are
both
appropriately
medium
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinker
a
good
coffee
stout
where
the
emphasis
is
on
the
coffee
cheers
consumed
on
11072010
certainly
a
full
bodied
beer
smoothsyrupy
finish
that
is
pretty
nice
ironically
sort
of
a
sweetsmooth
finish
pretty
nice
pretty
drinkable
but
more
of
a
slow
sipper
heavier
than
i
expected
for
the
abv
but
its
good
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
didnt
hate
it
but
only
go
for
it
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
coffee
beer
o
it
is
a
good
imperial
stout
and
has
a
nice
coffee
flavor
as
the
name
suggests
and
a
nice
bittereness
as
well
overall
this
guy
is
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
im
having
it
as
a
night
cap
and
am
really
enjoying
it
for
such
an
occasion
this
one
is
probably
a
little
too
aggressive
to
try
as
food
pairing
but
standing
alone
it
is
a
nice
robust
brew
would
make
a
great
pairing
to
any
dessert
o
a
good
enough
beer
but
lacked
complexity
o
a
solid
coffee
beer
like
many
beers
of
this
nature
you
do
have
to
enjoy
the
coffee
flavor
but
if
you
do
this
is
a
winner
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
was
looking
for
a
good
solid
coffee
stout
and
i
found
it
delicious
its
a
good
beer
if
you
like
coffee
interesting
brew
only
had
one
other
of
this
style
and
do
believe
i
would
buy
one
again
for
those
who
like
coffee
youll
love
it
for
those
who
dont
beyond
anything
but
a
nuance
i
cant
recommend
this
to
you
poured
into
a
pint
glass
almost
pitch
black
in
appearance
with
a
big
fluffy
khaki
colored
head
smells
of
rich
roasted
coffee
with
hints
of
mocha
tastes
like
a
cold
cup
of
not
too
bitter
coffee
has
a
rich
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
one
of
my
favorite
of
this
style
pours
into
a
snifter
dark
black
with
a
huge
fluffy
tan
head
standard
for
the
style
nose
is
espresso
cream
and
roasted
dark
coffee
beans
taste
is
actually
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
the
coffee
flavour
is
mild
yet
remains
subtly
bitter
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
a
decent
and
well
executed
coffee
stout
one
of
the
better
medium
roast
profiles
overall
i
love
this
beer
it
has
all
my
favorite
qualities
of
a
stout
while
the
bite
keeps
every
sip
from
getting
boring
d
very
easy
drinking
and
full
flavored
stout
and
even
with
this
being
half
a
year
old
is
remarkable
many
coffee
stouts
that
i
come
across
share
the
same
problems
with
bells
java
stout
where
the
coffee
is
so
aggressive
it
is
unpleasant
too
bad
i
like
bells
o
fine
coffee
stout
especially
for
40raining
opening
day
for
mlb
great
inbetween
beer
got
enough
flavor
to
sip
but
find
myself
gulping
it
too
overall
this
one
is
a
solid
a
i
havent
had
a
much
better
beer
drinkability
is
good
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
slowdrinker
but
it
is
tasty
and
very
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
feels
just
great
going
down
and
the
drinkability
is
exceptional
i
really
had
a
good
time
drinking
this
one
this
is
just
a
great
stout
bells
just
has
hit
after
hit
with
regards
to
stouts
theyre
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favourite
breweries
over
all
a
good
beer
far
short
of
beers
such
as
founders
breakfast
stout
but
if
you
want
a
bit
more
espresso
this
might
be
the
way
to
go
a
perfect
beer
pours
black
smells
of
coffee
and
chocolate
which
is
a
benefit
for
those
that
are
coffee
and
chocolate
lovers
tastes
of
malts
coffee
and
chocolate
of
course
smooth
overall
feeling
drinkability
just
like
my
coffee
cant
stop
at
one
cup
well
this
beer
i
cant
stop
at
one
bottle
to
me
coffee
stouts
are
very
hit
or
miss
this
one
doesnt
quite
get
it
im
not
going
to
ding
a
beer
thats
in
a
style
that
im
not
wild
about
but
this
one
seems
to
miss
something
on
the
aftertaste
o
a
nice
surprise
here
this
goes
down
really
easy
and
that
is
on
top
of
an
old
raspy
very
drinkable
it
tastes
good
and
the
lingering
flavors
of
coffee
and
chocolate
rival
many
i
have
had
at
7
5
abv
it
is
well
hidden
o
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
i
felt
the
flavor
was
lacking
for
a
coffee
stout
it
could
have
used
a
more
intense
roastiness
and
although
the
coffee
smells
and
flavors
were
definitely
there
i
would
have
preferred
a
fresher
taste
instead
i
felt
as
if
i
was
drinking
a
cold
watered
down
irish
coffee
i
will
not
seek
out
this
beer
again
batch
8158
this
beer
is
over
4
years
old
but
there
is
still
a
lot
of
coffee
flavors
in
here
a
bit
boozy
but
seriously
delicious
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
coffee
but
this
is
a
coffee
lovers
dream
cant
speak
for
it
fresh
but
with
four
years
on
it
theres
still
plenty
of
carbonation
and
deliciousness
in
this
glass
bells
always
kills
it
d
not
a
session
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
full
and
thick
but
strangely
a
bit
watery
for
brief
moments
drinkability
is
excellent
due
to
the
awesome
coffee
flavor
being
well
balanced
and
not
too
bitter
at
all
bells
clearly
aims
for
one
thing
in
this
beer
and
they
achieve
it
well
o
i
try
this
one
year
after
year
and
i
just
cant
get
a
taste
for
it
i
want
to
cheer
for
it
because
of
my
love
for
the
brewery
however
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
rough
beer
session
this
is
where
the
beer
falters
the
flavors
needed
a
bold
feel
yet
it
feels
a
bit
thin
little
creaminess
and
even
a
bit
oily
maybe
it
was
an
old
bottle
still
a
decent
beer
drinkability
decent
brew
but
not
very
complex
in
taste
it
seem
the
tartness
is
out
of
character
for
this
beer
and
was
most
unappealing
to
me
d
drinkability
is
low
unfortunately
for
the
look
and
first
half
of
the
smell
the
taste
and
infection
just
destroy
this
didnt
even
get
halfway
through
before
throwing
in
the
towel
i
will
be
looking
out
for
a
fresh
batch
of
this
though
as
it
does
seem
to
have
promise
drinkability
if
you
love
coffee
in
your
beer
this
one
is
for
you
nicely
balanced
as
compared
to
other
coffee
offerings
ive
had
not
something
i
would
make
a
habit
of
having
due
to
the
intense
nature
of
the
coffee
addition
but
i
can
appreciate
the
depth
needed
to
make
this
more
than
a
onetrickpony
109th
the
flavor
sticks
strictly
to
the
coffee
end
of
the
equation
not
even
much
sweetness
to
balance
chocolate
does
emerge
especially
on
the
finish
but
its
heavily
balanced
toward
the
java
pretty
bitter
but
not
much
in
the
hops
direction
body
is
middle
of
the
road
could
definitely
be
bigger
for
my
taste
pretty
smooth
but
the
carbonation
works
too
hard
up
front
definitely
a
coffee
stout
from
top
to
bottom
and
as
a
daily
drinker
of
black
joe
i
enjoy
it
very
much
not
for
everyone
d
im
drinking
this
pretty
quickly
this
is
a
very
tasty
coffee
stout
if
youre
a
coffee
fan
this
is
a
must
try
smooth
rich
and
chewy
low
effervescence
with
a
full
body
some
coffeeburnt
shows
up
in
the
aftertaste
a
thoroughly
fine
brew
in
all
regards
d
this
is
okay
but
the
roastiness
is
way
over
done
it
does
not
come
close
to
fbs
or
wake
n
bake
overall
a
good
beer
since
i
love
coffee
good
sipper
with
nothing
you
would
not
expect
from
a
coffee
stout
though
just
like
with
coffee
one
is
usually
enough
in
a
sitting
drunkability
great
beer
but
not
sure
on
how
many
i
could
drink
wihtout
switching
to
something
less
distinct
pepper
taste
gets
to
me
even
tho
i
do
love
it
d
4
i
dont
usually
want
to
have
multiple
stouts
in
one
sitting
but
i
think
i
could
get
there
with
this
one
its
really
not
all
that
heavy
for
its
style
and
i
enjoyed
its
flavor
id
recommend
trying
this
one
to
anyone
that
loves
java
and
brew
moreys
bottom
line
a
pretty
good
coffee
stout
i
just
drank
a
fbs
prior
to
this
and
i
prefer
it
but
this
is
still
pretty
good
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
coffee
stout
it
had
all
the
flavors
that
i
have
come
to
expect
from
this
style
but
was
better
balanced
then
most
and
the
flavors
never
felt
artificial
as
they
sometimes
can
after
all
is
said
and
done
i
would
say
this
is
the
second
best
coffee
stout
i
have
had
with
founders
breakfast
stout
being
slightly
better
but
not
by
much
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
brew
and
i
dont
know
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
it
this
beer
has
definitely
earned
a
place
in
my
fridge
keep
it
up
bells
you
guys
rock
drinkability
not
something
id
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
really
the
feel
is
extreme
smoothness
with
a
hint
of
carbonation
with
a
strong
taste
of
coffee
no
surprise
and
dark
chocolate
because
of
the
almost
syrupy
feel
the
aftertaste
lingers
for
a
very
long
time
this
seems
to
be
an
excellent
afterdinner
drink
but
because
of
the
heaviness
has
limited
drinkability
still
it
is
an
outstanding
coffee
stout
mouthfeel
drinkability
an
addictive
taste
as
coffee
often
is
very
bitter
and
tart
in
your
mouth
im
glad
i
finally
decided
to
pick
this
up
it
is
quite
a
different
stout
because
of
its
sour
prune
notes
d
id
call
this
highly
drinkable
it
tastes
good
and
doesnt
have
any
truly
objectionable
qualities
d
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
not
really
the
problem
coffee
overload
is
really
what
knocks
down
the
drinkability
a
half
notch
this
is
a
nice
coffee
beer
but
if
you
have
a
couple
in
a
row
it
will
crush
your
palate
in
a
coffee
mess
i
think
imperial
stout
is
a
wrong
declaration
of
style
for
the
record
d
easy
going
down
nothing
superspecial
but
nothing
bad
either
this
one
is
good
save
for
the
ashyburnt
taste
if
i
could
get
past
that
this
would
be
a
fantastic
beer
but
i
cant
get
past
it
to
compare
with
coffee
this
is
an
espresso
shot
straight
up
not
a
caramel
mochachino
latte
there
are
a
lot
of
intense
flavors
being
thrown
around
which
is
fun
but
quite
trying
the
bitter
roastiness
the
coffee
the
sweetness
the
booze
its
all
there
and
dancing
around
in
some
crazed
circus
overall
a
lot
of
fun
for
your
palate
but
not
an
everydayer
drinks
okay
nothing
special
unfortunately
though
its
heavily
charredashburnt
character
sets
it
apart
from
some
others
of
the
style
pretty
good
d
this
beer
drinks
pretty
good
the
flavors
are
intense
though
so
one
is
enough
to
give
your
buds
a
ride
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
stout
the
flavors
arent
too
over
the
top
but
the
beer
is
filling
ill
definitely
grab
some
more
this
winter
this
beer
combines
my
two
loves
beer
and
coffee
very
dark
black
in
color
nice
tannish
head
that
stays
around
lacing
is
average
overall
very
pleasing
in
appearence
wow
nothing
pretentious
about
this
beer
the
nose
is
heavenly
with
tons
of
strong
coffee
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
the
style
and
apv
taste
is
what
i
expected
and
wanted
burnt
chocolatecoffeenice
bitterness
great
finish
enjoyable
offering
from
bells
if
youre
looking
for
a
stout
that
has
real
coffee
flavor
thats
not
over
the
top
this
is
a
good
option
drinkability
smooth
creamy
stout
with
and
easy
finish
may
not
be
my
favorite
stout
but
would
definitely
drink
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
coffeeinfused
stout
but
a
bit
more
restraint
with
the
coffee
would
do
this
brew
much
more
justice
d
one
at
a
time
this
is
a
specific
beer
very
nice
appropriate
for
the
style
i
cant
imagine
what
its
like
completely
fresh
pours
as
black
as
coffee
with
a
thin
brown
head
that
dissolves
into
almost
nothing
except
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
almost
all
coffee
roasted
beans
burnt
grinds
and
cold
coffee
there
is
also
a
little
stout
aroma
in
there
dark
fruits
some
almond
and
roasted
malts
the
flavor
just
accentuates
all
of
these
aromas
espresso
black
coffee
roasted
malts
some
leather
but
also
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
a
vague
sweetness
the
coffee
flavor
is
very
strong
but
not
necessarily
the
best
coffee
flavor
that
ive
had
in
a
coffee
stout
it
tastes
a
bit
like
old
cold
coffee
the
finish
is
pretty
mild
with
a
faint
roasted
bitterness
however
the
aftertaste
is
really
nice
and
creates
some
nice
eructations
its
a
pretty
good
coffee
stout
but
ive
been
spoiled
on
the
likes
of
breakfast
stout
and
berkshire
coffeehouse
porter
and
this
isnt
quite
in
their
league
d
much
better
than
i
thought
not
a
coffee
drinker
but
very
easy
drink
great
for
a
cold
winters
night
or
early
in
the
morning
when
standing
in
line
for
a
beer
release
d
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
d
its
good
but
im
ready
to
move
on
good
example
of
the
style
but
i
usially
want
to
move
on
after
having
one
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
it
just
tastes
like
coffee
edit
i
always
meant
to
try
this
again
and
thanks
to
salukialum
i
was
able
to
get
a
bottle
since
i
moved
west
on
27
january
2012
almost
a
year
to
the
date
after
having
this
the
first
time
i
cant
say
i
was
wrong
about
it
the
body
still
seems
thin
and
the
coffee
in
the
nose
just
seems
stale
and
musty
d
moderate
drinkability
this
beer
almost
needs
something
to
compliment
or
contrast
it
perhaps
some
ice
cream
on
its
own
its
just
a
little
too
direct
abv
is
up
there
but
well
hidden
d
great
coffee
stout
im
not
a
big
fan
of
coffee
and
this
one
has
plenty
of
it
very
little
malt
or
hop
flavor
rich
bodied
with
a
suitable
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
like
drinking
coffee
not
my
cup
of
tea
pun
intended
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
love
coffee
and
beer
but
its
just
not
for
me
d
i
could
and
would
drink
it
for
breakfast
lunch
and
dinner
instead
of
my
morning
coffee
at
work
just
crack
one
of
these
i
love
iced
coffee
so
this
cold
works
great
heck
it
might
be
worth
a
try
warm
i
love
coffee
and
thats
what
this
beer
is
but
it
stays
safely
within
drinkable
bounds
but
for
those
who
sugar
up
their
coffee
in
the
morning
this
stout
will
be
too
offensive
the
flavor
is
big
coffee
and
roasted
malt
flavor
the
coffee
flavor
is
strong
and
bitter
hits
big
up
front
then
mellows
considerably
into
more
of
a
porter
like
beer
with
a
high
drinkability
the
nose
is
much
stronger
than
the
flavor
which
is
nice
because
the
nose
is
huge
on
this
one
and
i
think
too
much
coffee
would
be
overpowering
all
and
all
a
good
beer
perhaps
my
favorite
coffee
stout
this
is
truly
a
benchmark
for
this
style
if
you
havent
has
this
pick
it
up
and
it
cellars
well
this
review
is
from
a
beer
that
cellared
for
a
year
and
tasted
every
bit
as
good
if
not
slightly
more
mellow
than
it
did
a
year
ago
the
first
time
i
ever
tried
this
beer
i
was
much
earlier
on
in
my
good
beer
journey
and
i
have
to
say
i
was
not
a
fan
it
pretty
much
just
tasted
like
cold
coffee
and
since
i
like
my
coffee
to
be
99
beer
i
did
not
seek
this
out
to
buy
it
again
having
it
now
i
can
reach
through
and
pick
out
the
beer
qualities
and
find
it
to
be
a
nice
complex
coffee
stout
that
should
please
coffee
and
beer
lovers
alike
d
easy
as
pumpkin
pie
or
is
it
apple
pie
cherry
pie
for
a
seven
a
half
you
dont
feel
it
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
i
had
been
drinking
this
all
season
long
instead
of
staring
at
the
price
tag
hella
worth
it
lieutenant
worf
it
even
overall
this
is
a
very
good
coffeeflavored
brew
and
id
drink
it
again
however
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
a
few
in
a
single
sitting
i
think
if
the
coffee
was
toned
back
just
a
tad
itd
be
more
ideal
for
drinkability
overall
java
stout
is
just
another
good
beer
from
the
guys
at
bells
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
diversity
and
complexity
in
the
flavor
for
this
to
be
a
really
good
stout
but
as
it
is
this
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
bottle
dwow
this
is
quite
a
heavy
beer
it
took
awhile
to
get
through
because
of
this
picks
up
no
weird
tastes
but
i
found
no
reason
why
id
ever
want
to
try
this
again
a
coffee
lovers
beer
through
and
through
possibly
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
thus
far
hopslam
is
too
limited
oracle
is
even
worse
and
too
boozy
expedition
is
great
but
not
as
tasty
as
this
dvery
balanced
for
such
a
big
beer
which
i
like
very
much
often
the
sweetness
and
bitterness
fight
for
control
and
the
coffee
can
seem
like
a
sideline
player
in
this
brew
coffee
is
the
star
and
she
is
a
diva
drinkability
as
a
coffee
lover
this
has
a
strong
appeal
for
me
and
i
find
it
very
easy
to
drink
people
who
do
not
enjoy
coffee
as
much
will
not
like
this
stout
d
wow
what
a
good
beer
coffee
stout
bells
awesomeness
verdict
one
of
the
boldest
most
intense
stouts
that
i
have
ever
had
but
impressive
all
around
if
you
enjoy
java
coffee
or
espresso
as
much
as
you
enjoy
beer
theres
no
doubt
that
this
will
fill
your
cravings
everything
tastes
pure
and
real
and
the
end
result
is
a
well
done
coffeeheavy
beverage
definitely
worth
a
try
for
everybody
bells
brewery
did
very
well
for
this
one
a
4
1
this
coffee
stout
appears
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
thin
eighth
inch
layer
of
beige
head
the
aroma
is
primarily
of
coffee
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
lingering
behind
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
not
as
fullflavored
as
i
would
prefer
the
coffee
and
roasted
malt
are
certainly
there
but
could
be
fresher
zestier
more
aromatic
flavorful
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
not
among
the
elite
coffee
stouts
this
is
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
ive
had
the
problem
is
it
drinks
like
coffee
a
few
cups
and
your
done
if
you
are
thinking
about
coffee
is
give
this
one
a
go
you
wont
regret
it
d
maybe
two
before
moving
on
drinks
pretty
easily
smooth
tasty
clean
and
moderately
complex
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
id
certainly
get
it
again
sometime
will
not
buy
again
this
is
a
nice
roasty
stout
i
dont
like
coffee
but
still
enjoyed
this
the
only
issue
i
could
find
is
that
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
heavier
and
creamier
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
some
malt
leadoff
and
nice
coffee
flavors
in
the
latemid
palate
regions
the
finish
is
nice
and
mildly
dry
and
mildly
bitter
no
lingering
aftertaste
pretty
decent
beer
notes
a
pleasant
surprise
that
i
have
seen
on
the
shelves
for
years
and
finally
tried
due
to
price
and
availability
i
would
buy
this
ahead
of
founders
breakfast
stout
it
feels
about
average
going
down
and
while
it
tastes
good
its
not
great
best
part
is
the
label
and
the
label
is
nice
like
a
big
nosed
coffee
cup
drinkability
flavorful
and
big
on
coffee
even
refreshing
for
a
imperial
stout
the
is
no
doubt
this
is
a
coffee
stout
your
sense
are
assailed
by
strong
coffee
the
minute
the
bottle
is
opened
over
all
not
a
bad
beer
the
coffee
is
a
little
stronger
than
id
like
but
it
drinks
easy
id
be
more
impressed
if
id
never
had
pipeline
porter
that
is
made
with
kona
coffee
which
was
smoothe
as
silk
bells
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
even
though
this
is
not
a
home
run
in
my
mind
mdthick
and
rich
filling
unbelievably
delicious
easy
to
drink
wish
i
had
a
6er
and
not
a
single
smooth
with
a
touch
of
a
bite
the
coffee
in
this
one
is
a
perfect
match
for
the
beer
bells
never
disappoints
and
this
one
is
no
exception
my
verdict
here
is
that
it
has
a
great
aroma
and
starts
decent
enough
but
in
the
end
im
turned
off
by
what
id
consider
to
be
off
flavors
for
a
stout
d
dont
drink
this
if
you
dont
like
coffee
great
beer
but
its
heavy
heavy
very
good
but
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
more
then
one
or
too
fast
dark
tan
34
head
at
pour
dark
black
color
literally
as
black
as
coffee
powerful
coffee
aroma
could
be
some
chocolate
hidden
in
aroma
but
smells
exactly
like
wet
coffee
grinds
heavy
silky
cream
texture
to
mouthfeel
almost
syrupy
huge
coffee
flavor
with
some
small
chocolate
notes
bold
even
if
you
are
a
regular
coffee
drinker
nice
dark
lacing
on
the
glass
warmth
brings
a
nutty
note
to
aroma
and
a
little
more
sweetness
to
the
already
sweet
flavor
dry
roasty
bitter
finish
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
true
to
its
name
in
every
form
you
definitely
have
to
like
or
be
able
to
tolerate
coffee
to
drink
this
one
basically
like
drinking
cold
coffee
coffee
being
the
dominate
factor
in
this
one
does
give
much
room
for
anything
else
d
enjoyable
beer
definitely
in
the
top
for
coffee
brews
this
beer
pours
the
darkest
of
browns
on
the
verge
of
black
with
the
lightest
of
light
khaki
heads
it
smells
of
very
very
rich
roasted
coffee
beans
and
has
chocolate
aromas
as
well
the
flavor
essentially
mirrors
a
chocolate
influenced
java
coffee
it
is
very
rich
and
very
chocolaty
the
flavor
is
exceptional
it
drinks
very
smoothly
full
bodied
and
rich
the
content
creeps
up
on
you
it
is
very
drinkable
and
a
delicious
beer
id
highly
recommend
it
drinkability
great
stout
easy
to
drink
not
too
thick
or
overwhelming
great
balance
this
is
one
sexy
brew
i
could
see
getting
this
once
a
year
and
pulling
one
from
the
pack
on
occasion
great
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
it
bell
makes
some
great
beers
and
i
think
they
delivered
with
this
one
if
your
in
the
mood
to
try
a
good
stout
try
this
one
i
dont
think
youll
regret
it
d
good
drinkability
as
much
as
i
love
coffee
the
flavor
is
somewhat
intense
a
great
beer
for
coffee
and
beer
lovers
d
with
more
carbonation
this
beer
would
be
significantly
more
interesting
d
sort
of
an
out
of
whack
coffee
stout
if
you
ask
me
i
do
fear
most
that
the
bottle
may
be
past
prime
but
ive
also
encountered
other
carbonated
coffee
beverages
with
this
same
issue
at
any
rate
the
7
5
abv
which
carries
a
bit
of
a
stinging
hard
swallow
that
combined
with
the
sour
coffee
flavor
doesnt
score
it
very
high
with
me
dpretty
easy
though
not
in
mass
amounts
due
to
the
added
flavors
of
the
coffee
with
that
however
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
enjoy
when
looking
for
something
in
the
realm
of
coffee
beers
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
a
bit
big
and
full
with
both
hands
it
goes
down
with
a
warm
smooth
feeling
and
is
a
drinkable
flavorful
stout
that
feels
like
it
has
my
number
a
really
well
built
stout
d
drinkability
is
good
and
even
upping
the
abv
of
this
brew
to
really
give
it
imperial
status
would
be
ideal
pours
a
deep
brownish
black
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
coffee
and
tasty
black
chocolate
tastes
a
little
of
smoke
caramel
coffee
dark
chocolate
sweet
malts
a
little
hops
and
hints
of
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
this
beer
pours
a
blackness
with
a
tan
foam
and
good
lacing
the
smell
is
clearly
really
very
coffeelike
perhaps
caramel
but
really
its
just
espresso
this
beer
tastes
like
coffee
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
for
a
coffee
stout
its
rather
nice
but
i
would
like
more
complexity
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
oddly
smooth
for
coffee
being
involved
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
a
great
standard
coffee
stout
but
as
i
said
its
just
standard
no
complexity
to
make
it
wonderful
first
one
of
these
that
ive
had
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
hard
pour
made
for
a
large
head
that
took
about
10
minutes
to
go
away
very
dark
with
a
smell
dominated
by
the
coffee
the
taste
was
also
dominated
with
strong
coffee
so
much
so
that
nothing
else
made
it
through
at
first
but
the
coffee
is
slightly
off
tasting
as
if
the
pot
sat
out
a
bit
too
long
and
oxidized
as
the
beer
warmed
the
malt
and
a
bit
of
chocolte
barely
make
their
way
into
the
flavor
but
still
mostly
slightly
stale
coffee
the
mouthfeel
was
solid
and
not
overly
thick
this
is
one
stout
that
i
could
probably
have
2
and
not
be
overwhelmed
by
i
just
dont
know
if
id
want
that
much
coffee
flavor
especially
when
it
just
seems
to
have
a
little
missing
in
the
flavor
the
flavor
is
coffee
with
a
hint
of
tanginess
i
dont
really
like
it
i
seem
to
be
getting
a
lot
of
misses
with
coffee
beers
lately
pours
out
a
rich
coffee
black
color
with
a
beige
head
head
dissipates
into
a
thin
foam
crema
with
some
lacing
already
happening
to
my
glass
smell
is
interesting
black
coffee
some
liquorish
tobacco
smoke
and
bittersweet
chocolate
very
complex
smelling
you
can
keep
smelling
it
and
picking
up
other
whiffs
other
subtleties
it
is
quite
nice
now
for
the
taste
wow
big
espresso
middle
with
some
dark
roasted
chocolate
malts
and
bitter
oily
aftertaste
the
taste
of
this
beer
lingers
on
the
palate
for
quite
a
long
time
like
a
rich
demitasse
of
espresso
i
would
rate
the
mouthfeel
as
being
exactly
as
it
should
be
but
the
rich
oilyness
affects
drinkability
a
little
bit
overall
it
is
a
quite
nice
although
i
am
thankful
it
is
available
in
singles
at
my
local
liquor
store
i
could
imagine
this
beer
would
be
a
bit
much
in
a
full
six
pack
would
take
me
a
while
to
drink
all
of
them
but
would
be
great
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
aging
a
little
i
think
java
stout
could
also
make
a
great
nightcap
cheers

soaked
in

coffee
hits
the
palate
first
followed
by

very
roasty
and
smokey
aftertaste
that
lingers
around
for
awhile
accents
the
strong
coffee
flavor
very
well
fairly
light
mouthfeel
with
minimal
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
from
bells
sorta
on
the
light
side
i
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
no
problem
though
i
love
beer
and
i
love
coffee
so
you
would
think
this
beer
would
be
perfect
but
not
so
this
java
stout
features
a
combination
of
a
weak
stout
beer
and
a
coffee
that
tastes
as
though
it
has
been
sitting
in
the
pot
for
weeks
and
was
very
weak
when
brewed
everyone
else
seems
to
love
it
on
here
so
maybe
a
just
got
a
bad
bottle
d
i
hope
you
like
coffee
if
you
bought
this
if
you
didnt
abort
overall
this
beer
from
bells
hides
the
7
5
abv
very
well
as
far
as
american
doubleimperial
stouts
go
this
one
goes
down
smooth
definitely
a
sipper
its
missing
that
certain
wow
factor
that
would
put
this
beer
into
an
a
range
but
a
solid
very
good
beer
a
little
thicker
than
most
on
the
tounge
so
definately
more
of
a
sipper
but
a
really
nice
beer
bells
knocks
another
one
out
of
the
park
it
may
not
have
gone
500
ft
but
definately
put
a
run
on
the
board
d
very
easy
drinking
for
the
style
low
abv
helps
in
that
respect
this
one
is
more
like
a
jackedup
irish
stout
than
the
smooth
and
mellow
imperial
stouts
and
porters
that
are
more
akin
to
barley
wines
poured
a
nice
dark
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
left
a
little
bit
of
lacing
but
not
much
it
smells
really
good
you
can
definitely
smell
the
coffee
there
are
also
notes
of
chocolate
molasses
and
a
bit
of
licorice
it
tastes
great
you
can
really
taste
the
coffee
and
it
melds
well
with
the
dark
malts
chocolate
notes
are
present
near
the
finish
and
are
very
nice
also
there
is
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
there
somewhere
there
is
a
nice
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
its
nice
and
creamy
with
a
heavier
body
on
it
but
deinitely
not
the
heaviest
one
of
the
style
by
any
means
decent
carbonation
on
this
beer
as
well
this
was
a
really
drinkable
stout
it
went
down
a
lot
smoother
than
a
lot
of
coffee
stouts
i
have
had
before
i
really
like
this
beer
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
that
is
a
fan
of
the
style
good
job
bells
cheers
drinkability
good
you
cant
drink
it
all
night
but
one
or
two
while
watching
hockey
games
is
a
good
fit
overall
im
very
happy
with
this
beer
i
enjoyed
my
last
bottle
more
than
i
had
in
the
past
drinkability
im
inclined
to
say
that
this
is
the
ultimate
coffee
stout
the
coffee
flavor
is
so
rich
and
deep
that
no
others
can
really
compare
in
that
respect
however
this
also
makes
the
beer
slightly
onedimensional
so
youve
got
to
really
like
coffee
for
this
one
to
make
your
day
fortunately
im
in
this
camp
d
i
like
it
and
can
easily
drink
a
few
tonight
dark
brown

with

smooth
creamy
finish
nice
coffee
stout
from

i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
im
a
huge
coffee
lover
that
being
said
i
found
this
disappointing
overall
glad
i
only
grabbed
a
single
alcohol
is
apparent
and
taste
is
strong
a
real
sipper
the
beer
pours
black
no
highlights
shining
through
at
all
a
23
finger
tan
head
rises
up
and
lingers
for
a
moment
lacing
and
head
retention
are
both
decent
but
overall
ive
seen
a
few
more
impressive
looking
stouts
bells
java
stout
has
one
of
the
bestmost
potent
aromas
ive
found
on
a
beer
in
a
long
time
after
pouring
i
could
smell
the
coffee
from
halfway
across
the
room
and
were
talking
a
pretty
good
sized
room
to
boot
further
olfactory
inspection
leads
to
the
discovery
of
a
fair
amount
of
dark
chocolate
sweetness
though
rich
coffee
is
definitely
still
in
the
drivers
seat
each
sip
brings
exactly
what
the
nose
promised
a
healthy
dose
of
coffee
with
dark
chocolate
making
some
noise
in
the
background
id
like
to
see
a
little
bit
more
going
on
before
i
give
it
a
better
score
a
dash
of
caramel
a
hint
of
fruits
just
something
beyound
the
coffeechocolate
i
also
am
picking
up
on
a
little
bit
of
a
harsh
bitterness
it
feels
like
maybe
bells
extracted
some
unwanted
flavors
when
adding
coffee
to
java
stout
not
to
the
point
of
being
a
real
nuisance
but
definitely
noticeable
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
but
definitely
still
present
perfectly
suited
for
the
style
java
stout
is
impressively
rich
for
a
stout
of
relatively
small
size
very
creamy
java
stout
is
another
very
good
offering
from
bells
up
there
with
terrapins
coffee
oatmeal
stout
and
fbs
as
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
around
today
notes
good
coffee
stout
not
my
favorite
and
certainly
not
as
good
as
it
was
last
year
if
i
remember
right
and
my
taste
hasnt
changed
too
much
seems
like
they
spared
some
expense
on
the
ingredients
flavor
came
up
a
little
short
just
like
some
of
their
recent
stuff
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
overall
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
a
good
represenation
of
the
style
having
this
at
nearly
1
year
old
has
me
wanting
to
go
get
a
fresh
one
immediately
give
it
a
try
sounds
like
a
good
opportunity
for
a
sidebyside
maybe
with
expo
as
a
3rd
party
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
so
full
of
coffee
im
sure
has
as
much
caffeine
as
a
cup
of
coffee
so
drink
it
for
breakfast
kids
notes
definitely
a
coffee
stout
coffee
dominates
with
not
a
lot
else
coming
out
too
strong
as
it
just
gets
overwhelmed
went
back
and
forth
about
how
i
feel
about
the
taste
deciding
that
in
small
doses
its
nice
but
i
dont
really
want
too
much
the
smokey
tobacco
flavors
are
probably
what
really
probably
brings
this
down
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
though
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
a
coffee
lover
d
definitely
one
of
the
more
impressive
imperial
stouts
out
there
bells
is
really
impressing
me
more
and
more
with
each
offering
perfect
flavor
and
spot
on
mouthfeel
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
and
im
looking
forward
to
revisiting
it
pours
a
vet
dark
brown
with
a
tan
mocha
head
and
a
faint
bit
of
lace
nose
consists
mostly
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
coffee
takes
over
the
flavor
win
some
dy
roast
between
the
coffee
flavor
and
bitterness
i
really
like
the
feel
not
one
of
the
best
coffee
beers
but
a
solid
offering
a
decent
tasting
beer
but
definitely
not
an
a
beer
maybe
because
im
not
a
huge
coffee
fan
but
something
like
founders
breakfast
stout
is
much
better
this
is
a
little
too
bitter
like
its
straight
black
coffee
doubt
id
have
more
than
1
at
a
time
would
definitely
have
again
though
preferably
on
tap
d
not
bad
at
all
very
easy
to
handle
for
most
anyone
id
drink
these
all
the
time
if
i
could
afford
it
the
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
plentiful
carbonation
but
as
i
swallow
it
leaves
a
nice
chocolatey
coating
around
my
mouth
feeling
very
similar
to
eating
a
piece
of
chocolate
not
the
most
drinkable
coffee
stout
ive
ever
had
but
it
does
go
down
pretty
easy
for
a
7
5
beer
d
this
beer
is
unique
and
i
like
it
for
that
i
dont
believe
this
is
something
i
will
have
often
but
when
having
a
craving
for
it
probably
rarely
all
together
its
a
great
beer
to
try
but
i
recommend
getting
a
single
bottle
if
at
all
possible
a
big
rocky
brown
head
very
evident
coffee
aroma
on
the
nose
opaque
color
burnt
malts
on
the
nose
also
the
coffee
taste
is
not
subtle
in
this
beer
it
meshes
so
nicely
in
this
brew
i
am
not
a
coffee
drinker
but
absolutely
love
this
beer
theres
a
bit
of
carbonation
in
this
one
besides
coffee
i
get
toffee
and
roasted
undertones
a
great
bitterness
present
from
coffee
and
roasted
malts
rather
than
hops
much
like
other
people
that
have
had
batch
9462
i
can
confirm
that
this
must
be
infected
i
just
bought
this
beer
in
philly
at
the
foodery
after
having
had
this
beer
earlier
from
a
trade
the
one
from
the
trade
tasted
the
exact
same
way
and
though
i
didnt
review
that
beer
or
make
note
of
the
batch
i
have
to
assume
it
was
this
same
batch
drinker
beware
that
if
you
want
to
taste
acidic
rotten
brew
this
batch
is
it
the
question
is
will
i
ever
get
a
proper
java
stout
frm
bells
i
hope
batch
9462
poured
a
deep
dark
black
nice
tan
head
smells
good
coffee
with
hints
of
chocolate
thats
where
the
good
traits
end
this
tasted
awful
i
usually
love
stouts
i
drink
cold
espresso
and
coffee
ive
had
other
coffee
stouts
this
was
bitter
and
putrid
the
only
beer
i
ever
poured
away
because
i
couldnt
choke
it
down
i
would
be
curious
to
know
if
this
was
a
bad
batch
i
did
notice
one
other
review
which
mentioned
this
batch
number
and
they
had
the
same
experience
if
so
shame
on
bells
for
letting
this
out
of
the
brewery
this
rated
a
d
because
out
of
fairness
it
did
look
and
small
good
but
it
should
be
a
f
d
the
mouthfeel
helps
this
beer
and
as
it
warms
it
develops
a
little
more
complexity
and
balance
but
overall
this
beer
needs
more
malt
profile
and
balance
to
make
it
a
truly
great
example
too
much
coffe
aroma
and
flavor
for
me
i
bought
a
bottle
of
this
as
part
of
a
mix
a
6
from
food
friends
on
20th
spruce
in
philadelphia
i
must
have
purchased
a
bad
bottle
it
was
from
batch
9462
the
smell
was
there
it
had
an
awesome
coffee
aroma
to
it
that
i
was
very
excited
for
until
i
tasted
it
it
tasted
like
a
sour
i
love
sours
but
not
when
im
expecting
a
coffee
stout
notes
not
overly
complex
but
seems
well
balanced
with
hopcoffeenot
overly
sweet
and
because
the
espresso
isnt
in
your
face
strong
its
quite
drinkable
d
i
was
afraid
this
beer
was
going
to
be
so
overdone
that
it
would
be
nearly
undrinkable
gladly
i
was
wrong
very
tasty
brew
that
is
pretty
easy
on
the
palate
d
well
i
will
have
to
try
a
fresh
one
for
sure
to
see
if
i
can
get
any
hops
with
all
this
coffee
malt
i
sampled
here
but
for
the
price
its
a
very
good
smooth
beer
nice
d
i
sipped
this
beer
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
every
last
drop
especially
since
im
on
the
west
coast
and
dont
normally
get
to
drink
this
stuff
as
i
was
drinking
it
i
was
feeling
a
nice
warming
effect
and
a
nice
little
buzz
i
dont
think
this
is
a
good
session
beer
tastes
great
though
d
bells
definetely
created
a
java
stout
great
pairing
of
coffeeespresso
and
roasted
malts
i
wish
i
could
have
one
of
these
in
the
morning
before
work
although
the
flavor
is
not
as
complex
the
flavor
works
great
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
d
if
you
can
get
past
the
smell
its
not
too
bad
total
dessert
beer
in
my
mind
d
extremely
well
balanced
beer
makes
this
one
of
my
favorite
breakfast
beers
pours
a
moderishly
thick
black
with
no
head
thus
no
lacing
scent
is
of
fresh
brewed
iced
coffee
full
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
carmel
hints
of
dark
roasted
grains
and
char
taste
is
not
as
aggressive
as
the
scent
but
after
a
bitter
char
and
roasted
coffee
begining
it
ups
the
dark
fruit
and
carmel
charachters
so
much
so
that
they
are
in
balance
with
the
coffee
notes
making
a
somewhat
strange
yet
halfway
decent
tasting
brew
medium
bodied
not
oily
or
sludgy
little
aftertaste
mfd
a
sizzle
of
flavor
leaves
a
lasting
tingle
carbonation
offers
a
slight
buzz
on
the
tongue
though
a
little
too
coffee
heavy
for
my
liking
dinteresting
a
bit
heavy
on
the
coffee
for
me
i
like
mostly
beer
with
coffee
notes
but
this
was
the
opposite
either
way
glad
i
tried
it
and
worth
looking
into
bells
java
stout
poured
black
with
a
tan
head
that
persisted
for
awhile
it
smelt
dark
and
rich
with
a
strong
coffee
flavor
the
taste
contained
a
very
strong
coffee
flavor
it
had
a
very
strong
and
heavy
flavor
overall
a
good
beer
the
coffee
flavors
may
be
a
bit
strong
one
to
avoid
if
you
dislike
cofee
d
this
is
a
easy
going
beer
not
too
heavy
but
not
too
weak
a
nice
balance
of
complexity
between
coffee
and
stout
d
it
is
a
good
one
off
but
you
likely
wont
want
multiples
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
a
coffee
stout
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
nothing
extraordinary
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
go
nuts
trying
to
seek
this
one
out
medium
to
almost
full
body
and
good
coffee
flavors
on
the
finish
this
is
a
contemplative
beer
one
to
enjoy
but
not
necessarily
a
beer
to
have
2
or
3
in
one
sitting
d
on
the
heavier
side
for
a
stout
so
only
somewhat
drinkable
probably
wouldnt
be
able
to
finish
a
second
in
succession
d
not
sessionable
but
a
good
tasting
single
beer
treat
you
could
have
this
for
breakfast
with
your
leftover
pizza
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
coffee
and
chocolate
you
also
get
some
bitter
notes
either
from
the
coffee
or
the
roasted
malts
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
coffee
with
some
chocolate
mixed
in
there
is
some
low
bitterness
in
the
beer
and
the
coffee
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
mediumthick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
the
mouthfeel
helps
this
beer
and
as
it
warms
it
develops
a
little
more
complexity
and
balance
but
overall
this
beer
needs
more
malt
profile
and
balance
to
make
it
a
truly
great
example
beer
poured
black
as
night
with
a
bubbly
brown
head
nose
is
sweet
mocha
and
hints
of
coffee
taste
is
heavy
on
the
roasted
malts
coffee
sweet
mocha
with
a
bitter
coffee
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
in
which
the
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
but
it
is
not
for
the
faint
of
palate
as
the
finish
is
very
strong
on
the
coffee
beansit
reminds
me
of
the
expresso
beans
from
trader
joes
d
the
acridness
makes
this
one
a
hard
beer
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
hidden
but
that
sour
acridness
makes
it
tough
going
down
d
not
a
bad
stout
a
very
strong
coffee
smell
and
taste
to
it
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
but
a
pretty
good
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
coffee
tasting
stouts
would
try
again
in
a
pinch
i
could
drink
it
but
for
the
price
there
are
far
better
stouts
to
be
had
d
easy
to
drink
for
a
stout
not
my
top
pick
but
definitely
id
im
in
the
mood
for
a
coffee
rich
flavor
dark
beer
i
would
choose
this
one
looks
excellent
smells
like
ground
coffee
tastes
like
ground
coffee
beans
not
getting
much
else
an
acrid
aftertaste
not
very
drinkable
imo
very
one
dimensional
for
me
i
like
my
beer
to
taste
a
little
bit
like
coffee
this
is
coffee
that
tastes
a
little
like
beer
overall
another
highly
enjoyable
offering
from
bells
a
bit
pricey
but
its
worth
it
would
be
a
nice
desert
or
after
dinner
beer
the
taste
and
drinkability
really
sold
me
on
this
one
if
you
enjoy
coffee
and
american
stouts
id
recommend
it
drinkability
i
would
buy
again
because
theres
not
alot
of
coffee
brews
in
my
area
but
i
could
have
used
more
balance
between
bitter
and
sweet
very
hearty
stout
with
a
strong
coffee
nose
dark
smooth
malty
with
the
coffee
opening
up
even
further
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
drinkability
although
i
do
not
imagine
i
would
want
to
session
this
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
one
that
i
went
through
a
bit
faster
than
expected
md
average
body
not
much
residual
sweetness
which
indicates
a
full
fermentation
nice
drink
but
not
sure
how
many
id
put
down
its
called
a
java
stout
and
the
dancing
coffee
cup
on
the
front
makes
it
very
clear
what
they
were
shooting
for
so
i
cant
really
dock
them
for
not
being
more
complex
but
id
really
like
to
see
some
of
the
other
more
traditional
stout
flavors
join
the
party
caramel
chocolate
dark
fruits
d
i
like
stouts
however
i
dont
believe
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
i
bet
it
would
taste
better
on
tap
d
yeah
id
order
another
and
buy
a
sixer
drinkability
i
would
certainly
seek
these
out
again
in
the
future
if
i
want
an
after
dinner
beer
now
that
ive
been
on
ba
for
over
a
year
and
have
tried
my
fair
share
of
great
beers
it
takes
quite
a
beer
to
blow
me
away
and
oddly
this
one
totally
did
it
i
really
am
enjoying
this
right
now
and
glad
i
waited
until
i
was
in
the
mood
to
have
a
good
stout
instead
of
forcing
a
new
beer
just
to
try
it
bells
grows
ever
higher
on
my
favorite
brewery
list
i
wouldnt
run
out
and
get
this
again
but
it
didnt
hurt
to
buy
a
single
bottle
of
it
and
i
will
probably
try
it
again
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
bad
bottle
d
i
could
def
drink
a
few
will
i
drink
it
all
night
no
overall
if
youre
a
coffee
drinker
you
will
enjoy
this
stout
however
for
the
price
16
bucks
a
sixer
i
cant
help
but
still
feel
i
paid
too
much
after
having
tried
it
if
you
got
the
dough
sip
this
joe
if
you
desire
something
that
pushes
the
envelope
look
elsewhere
overall
impression
i
do
like
coffee
stouts
and
coffee
stouts
but
this
was
just
a
bit
overthetop
in
the
coffee
department
for
me
d
i
like
this
for
a
coffee
stout
but
dont
know
how
many
i
could
have
in
a
sitting
the
sweetness
noted
in
the
taste
discounts
the
drinkability
d
bells
produces
some
outstanding
products
this
one
is
not
one
of
them
average
at
best
full
bodied
which
i
enjoy
but
i
cant
get
past
the
smell
and
taste
of
old
soggy
day
old
coffee
grounds
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
feel
and
low
carbonation
almost
drinks
more
like
a
milkshake
than
a
beer
not
particularly
big
bold
or
complex
but
there
is
a
good
balance
of
flavors
making
this
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
stout
d
maybe
2
or
3
tops
but
the
abv
and
body
are
very
coffeefreak
friendly
an
excellent
coffee
stout
one
of
many
black
pour
with
two
fingers
of
head
the
aroma
is
an
assault
of
coffee
beans
of
a
fruity
variety
some
milk
and
creamer
as
well
this
is
blistering
the
flavor
is
coffee
forward
and
it
is
a
gourmet
variety
some
chocolate
and
creamer
seem
to
be
at
play
in
the
background
very
clean
tasting
overall
and
not
very
bitter
despite
the
huge
coffee
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fuller
than
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
on
point
this
really
is
a
fantastic
coffee
beer
and
probably
the
first
one
to
impress
me
in
quite
a
while
d
relatively
low
abv
for
an
imperial
stout
and
more
drinkable
than
other
heavy
impy
stouts
very
good
beer
very
tasty
both
cold
and
roomtemp
its
much
silkier
at
roomtemp
and
not
as
bitter
d
very
good
but
there
are
many
better
coffee
stouts
out
there
overall
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
bells
makes
some
fantastic
brews
and
this
is
another
one
of
them
lots
of
stiff
dark
coffee
in
a
well
brewed
stout
the
beer
looks
beautiful
and
has
a
good
coffee
aroma
this
is
an
excellent
pairing
of
beer
and
coffee
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
overall
this
one
is
not
bad
i
have
had
more
wellrounded
coffee
stouts
than
this
but
itll
do
in
a
pinch
md
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
very
drinkabe
for
7
5
abv
if
i
could
getthis
in
ct
this
would
be
one
of
my
gotos
on
a
regular
basis
bottle
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
decent
amount
of
foam
using
the
duvel
tulip
smells
of
dark
roasted
coffee
the
flavour
follows
suit
as
you
get
hit
by
waves
of
coffee
goodness
very
smooth
drink
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
almost
wish
there
was
more
booze
in
this
one
a
decent
offering
and
way
better
then
the
cup
of
joe
from
the
same
state
i
got
this
from
dunt
in
a
bif
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
an
obsidian
black
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
if
full
of
freshly
brewed
coffee
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
coffee
is
the
dominant
flavor
overtaking
any
beerish
flavors
it
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
double
stout
but
not
terrible
very
well
carbonated
a
solid
coffee
beer
but
not
outstanding
this
was
an
enjoyable
stout
its
not
my
favorite
as
far
as
coffee
beers
go
but
i
thought
it
was
solid
good
drinkability
but
not
great
i
would
pour
another
if
i
had
it
d
easy
enough
to
finish
not
the
greatest
coffee
beer
ive
had
but
certainly
not
the
worst
overall
very
enjoyable
beer
i
have
stopped
drinking
coffee
for
the
most
part
so
this
is
a
nice
trip
down
tastebud
memory
lane
for
me
it
really
would
get
a
higher
rating
if
it
werent
for
the
thinness
of
the
body
but
then
again
that
same
thinness
makes
it
so
it
doesnt
fill
you
up
hmmm
interesting
dilemma
drinkability
good
drinkability
for
the
1
bottle
having
another
back
to
back
wouldnt
work
for
me
but
thats
not
a
knock
on
the
beer
at
all
the
7
5abv
though
not
obvious
would
sneek
up
on
me
and
i
try
not
to
let
beers
get
the
better
of
me
hey
id
be
posting
jibberish
in
the
forums
if
i
did
good
solid
brew
drinkability
was
good
overall
this
was
a
semi
sessionable
beer
very
rich
and
full
of
coffee
goodness
i
guess
the
only
downside
to
this
beer
was
that
there
was
nothing
to
balance
out
the
strong
coffee
flavors
my
favorite
beers
in
the
world
peche
mortel
and
espresso
yeti
both
have
some
sweetness
to
round
out
the
beer
and
make
them
more
complex
java
stout
was
just
slightly
rough
around
the
edges
but
still
extremely
good
wish
it
was
available
in
my
state
overall
highly
recommended
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
and
much
better
than
90
of
the
coffee
stouts
ive
tried
absolutely
destroys
breakfast
stout
in
my
opinion
i
drink
black
coffee
all
day
long
hot
or
cold
this
tastes
like
i
just
polished
off
the
last
cup
of
the
day
not
the
best
beer
but
not
a
bad
cup
of
joe
d
goes
down
smooth
for
sure
but
wouldnt
want
more
than
1
in
a
night
i
would
be
up
for
hours
and
hours
this
beer
accomplishes
exactly
what
it
seemingly
sets
out
to
do
mediumbodied
stout
dark
smooth
creamy
very
onedimensional
flavor
profile
but
nails
it
perfectly
coffee
is
wellintegrated
nice
touches
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
roasted
qualities
are
very
soft
a
pleasure
to
drink
kind
of
like
a
minispeedway
another
one
that
im
going
to
pay
more
attention
to
this
is
a
no
brainer
if
you
like
coffee
i
forsee
myself
getting
six
of
these
very
soon
especially
this
batch
and
i
may
up
that
to
24
a
lot
of
beers
dont
open
my
eyes
much
but
this
one
certainly
did
and
it
was
not
the
coffee
doing
it
this
is
a
great
one
to
go
to
if
you
want
some
stout
qualities
in
your
coffee
stout
ive
had
this
before
but
havent
appreciated
it
as
much
as
now
it
pours
like
it
may
be
thin
and
is
black
as
night
with
a
deep
foamy
dark
tan
head
that
fades
to
spotty
patterns
of
belgian
lacing
the
smell
is
aggressive
and
rich
with
well
roasted
coffee
beans
like
a
great
cup
of
coffee
then
it
pans
out
some
and
it
leaves
you
with
a
bitter
nose
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
on
the
oily
side
that
lends
to
a
fine
coating
texture
that
i
really
appreciate
in
a
good
double
stout
adds
nicely
to
the
rich
coffee
taste
a
really
fine
drinker
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
for
the
level
of
roastiness
but
it
hampers
the
drinkability
for
me
d
a
very
good
coffee
stout
from
bells
multidimensionally
chocolatey
much
more
so
than
i
was
anticipating
i
like
this
a
lot
but
it
doesnt
quite
jump
out
at
me
anyone
whos
a
fan
of
the
style
should
dig
this
one
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
but
nice
and
smooth
mobile
review
d
it
would
be
more
drinkable
if
the
taste
was
better
there
are
just
a
lot
better
coffee
stouts
out
there
imo
im
glad
i
tried
it
its
not
horrible
whatsoever
just
an
average
coffee
beer
d
this
was
a
very
good
coffee
stout
from
bells
the
coffee
flavors
are
nice
and
the
chocolate
pairs
well
too
but
i
was
hoping
for
some
stronger
and
fuller
flavors
overall
a
nice
drink
this
was
a
good
beer
but
nothing
i
am
stoked
over
i
wish
there
was
some
more
beer
flavors
in
there
the
burnt
coffee
taste
just
really
dominated
overall
this
was
another
fine
offering
from
bells
and
a
quality
coffee
stout
thanks
again
kevin
highly
recommended
very
good
stout
that
is
not
to
heavy
in
the
coffee
department
would
love
to
try
again
i
think
this
is
a
fine
coffee
stout
this
is
another
good
job
from
bells
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
am
looking
forward
to
the
others
i
have
in
my
stock
md
dryish
feeling
on
the
palate
texture
is
thick
and
minimally
carbonated
but
it
isnt
silky
like
other
beers
of
this
style
i
could
definitely
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
coffee
makes
this
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
with
breakfast
no
seriously
the
pour
is
jet
back
with
a
creamy
tan
head
and
some
sticky
lacing
nose
is
solely
roasted
coffee
beans
the
aroma
is
not
very
strong
and
is
not
complex
in
any
way
although
it
is
a
coffee
stout
i
would
like
some
chocolate
or
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
has
a
lot
of
roasted
characteristics
in
it
as
well
as
coffee
coffee
and
coffee
the
taste
is
very
good
but
pretty
straight
forward
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
could
definitely
sip
on
a
few
of
these
for
a
session
i
was
just
looking
for
a
little
more
complexity
d3
0
pours
a
near
black
with
a
light
brown
head
that
exhibits
pretty
good
retention
nice
patches
of
lace
aroma
is
dominated
by
roasted
malts
with
touches
of
chocolate
coffee
and
an
oatmeal
sweetness
taste
is
of
coffee
and
chocolate
frosting
with
a
hearty
roasty
finish
the
sweetness
makes
for
a
sticky
mouthfeel
although
its
creamy
too
quite
drinkable
the
carbonation
is
not
too
high
and
is
perfect
for
this
beer
medium
to
full
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
has
a
sticky
finish
to
it
nicely
drinkable
d
i
had
2
imperial
pints
20
oz
each
and
they
were
both
delicious
and
then
the
beer
got
warm
and
it
went
from
beer
to
pure
coffee
id
say
stick
to
one
drinkability
not
as
quite
as
good
as
founders
breakfast
stout
but
damn
close
java
stout
is
maybe
a
little
sweeter
and
not
quite
as
smooth
d
if
you
like
coffee
and
like
coffee
flavored
beers
youll
enjoy
this
coffee
is
all
up
in
it
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
certainly
one
that
i
would
sit
with
for
a
while
if
you
love
fbs
but
what
more
coffee
then
this
is
the
stout
for
you
good
beer
and
i
would
gladly
drink
it
again
but
there
is
a
very
good
field
of
coffee
beers
out
there
and
id
put
this
in
the
middle
tier
this
is
a
good
coffee
stout
but
nowhere
near
the
great
ones
both
beers
are
a
wonder
to
behold
if
you
can
find
them
both
you
are
a
lucky
person
indeed
and
if
youre
only
given
the
chance
to
try
this
one
then
thats
more
than
enough
too
drinkability
i
love
coffee
and
stouts
so
its
obvious
that
im
a
fan
of
coffee
stouts
this
is
very
tasty
and
definitely
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
i
recommend
this
if
youre
into
this
style
of
beer
d
ignore
the
label
and
any
preconceived
expectations
especially
if
youre
a
coffee
connoisseur
and
its
actually
a
pretty
unique
and
pleasing
beer
experience
time
to
go
french
press
some
ethiopian
yirgacheffe
to
remind
myself
what
good
coffee
tastes
like
overall
i
think
its
one
of
the
better
coffee
stouts
ive
had
leaves
very
nice
frothysticky
lacing
for
a
long
period
of
time
d
quite
yummy
the
bold
flavors
just
get
to
be
a
bit
much
towards
the
end
but
an
outstanding
affordable
and
readily
available
coffee
stout
yum
d
this
beer
did
impress
the
impressive
parts
were
unexpected
however
the
idea
of
coffee
beer
is
here
the
real
highlights
were
the
look
and
feel
of
this
beer
a
well
made
coffee
beer
indeed
but
the
look
and
feel
is
well
above
average
seek
out
drinkability
is
fairly
high
im
a
sucker
for
coffee
beers
and
this
is
a
very
good
one
f
finishes
bitter
from
the
stout
flavors
and
scorched
malts
it
dries
off
a
little
from
the
bittersweet
start
a
little
spicy
as
well
it
leaves
a
coating
on
the
entire
mouth
leaving
you
the
rich
coffee
and
roasted
flavors
for
a
while
a
nice
beer
pretty
thick
and
rich
a
little
difficult
to
drink
a
big
sipper
poured
black
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
short
tan
head
smells
of
used
coffee
grounds
and
burnt
malts
i
was
surprised
that
the
was
not
a
stronger
nose
of
warm
coffe
flavors
and
maybe
chocolateas
you
would
expect
for
a
coffee
stout
the
taste
of
burnt
day
old
coffe
overwelmed
my
tongue
the
only
other
flavor
i
got
was
a
slight
alcohol
finish
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
coffee
stouts
but
this
one
just
missed
i
expected
more
from
the
high
price
tag
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
duvel
glass
i
find
most
coffee
stouts
to
have
too
much
or
too
little
coffe
flavor
this
one
is
well
balanced
the
aroma
was
fantastic
and
the
taste
while
good
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
from
the
smell
starts
out
a
stout
and
finishes
with
the
taste
of
strong
coffee
and
hint
of
unexpectedbut
welcomesmokiness
would
definitely
drinkbuy
again
if
bells
were
a
little
easier
to
come
by
around
here
picked
up
a
lousy
of
this
at
the
beer
store
and
wanted
to
see
what
i
got
bells
on
a
whole
has
put
out
good
stuff
from
what
i
have
had
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
pick
up
a
sixer
of
not
bad
but
there
are
others
that
i
would
go
for
first
i
definately
plan
on
trying
other
stuff
from
bells
and
expect
to
get
good
results
d
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
as
fullbodied
as
i
hoped
i
like
coffee
and
stouts
so
i
had
hoped
i
would
really
like
this
for
the
price
i
think
i
probably
wont
buy
this
very
often
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
i
thought
drinkability
was
fine
but
not
awesome
the
strength
of
the
coffee
character
was
a
bit
too
much
d
while
i
like
the
taste
the
sweetness
may
preclude
me
from
drinking
more
than
one
good
beer
though
d
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
very
straightforward
and
powerful
drinkabilit
all
i
have
to
say
here
is
i
wish
it
didnt
taste
like
burnt
starbucks
not
high
on
my
list
of
coffee
stouts
the
bitter
was
too
much
for
me
i
like
coffee
stouts
a
lot
and
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
it
isnt
as
good
as
others
ive
had
the
coffee
is
very
overpowering
which
hurts
the
balance
and
doesnt
smell
or
taste
like
the
highest
quality
coffee
either
more
like
dayold
folgers
rather
than
gourmet
beans
granted
my
bottles
are
extremely
fresh
so
im
hoping
a
few
months
of
age
may
help
mellow
it
out
a
bit
this
review
is
based
on
my
second
bottle
about
a
week
after
the
first
one
and
it
is
better
than
initial
impressions
the
high
price
doesnt
help
either
next
review
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
having
sampled
it
once
however
i
feel
like
i
dont
need
to
purchase
it
again
it
was
just
a
little
too
coffeed
out
to
make
it
an
extremely
good
beer
much
better
than
the
cherry
stout
by
bells
would
definitely
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
with
no
real
bitterness
but
a
silky
texture
due
to
coffee
it
seemed
this
was
an
ok
beer
seemed
flat
to
me
only
problems
too
much
coffee
and
no
enough
sweetness
not
very
complex
i
wasnt
impressed
fullbodied
beer
here
slight
chewy
feel
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
flavors
of
coffee
cocoa
coffee
roasted
flavors
and
more
coffee
this
is
the
most
coffeeforward
beer
ive
ever
had
if
you
are
into
that
sorta
thing
this
is
the
beer
for
you
i
liked
it
d
its
a
good
coffee
stout
to
be
certain
but
it
lends
itself
to
the
sipping
category
more
than
anything
nicely
brewed
but
id
back
off
on
how
roasted
the
malts
are
if
it
were
me
it
would
let
the
coffee
flavor
pull
through
a
little
more
i
think
d
its
as
close
to
breakfast
as
any
beer
ive
had
the
coffee
is
the
star
so
you
better
be
a
big
coffee
fan
to
enjoy
this
in
its
current
state
i
would
say
one
and
done
i
am
interested
to
see
how
it
would
age
perhaps
letting
some
of
the
intense
coffee
flavor
meld
more
into
the
beer
i
would
have
liked
it
more
if
i
could
have
tasted
more
of
the
beer
nose
and
taste
are
both
loaded
with
coffee
slight
hints
of
cocoa
and
smokiness
but
this
brew
features
first
and
foremost
one
thing
coffee
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
which
is
to
be
expected
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
and
fairly
creamy
carbonation
is
appropriate
enjoyable
to
drink
but
quite
heavy
youre
not
chugging
this
thing
aroma
is
just
like
fine
coffee
with
a
smoky
overtone
hardly
like
beer
at
all
but
most
inviting
it
pours
a
deep
opaque
sable
nearly
black
with
a
very
thick
finebubbled
tan
head
flavor
is
rich
and
very
smoky
maybe
a
wee
bit
too
smoky
it
has
a
tasty
chocolate
undertone
and
hints
of
toffee
and
molasses
texture
is
thick
smooth
fairly
tingly
and
quite
satisfying
overall
an
immensely
pleasing
stout
this
is
a
supersolid
coffee
stout
i
must
take
umbrage
with
two
things
1
this
isnt
a
doubleimperial
stout
imo
and
2
at
1415
a
sixpack
this
is
incredibly
incredibly
overpriced
i
was
tempted
to
knock
the
drinkability
down
because
of
the
outrageous
price
but
then
i
realized
that
i
never
do
that
with
any
beer
those
two
things
said
this
is
yummy
thats
the
most
important
thing
seek
it
out
if
youre
a
coffee
stout
fanatic
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
if
you
like
coffee
finish
is
smooth
and
leaves
a
pleasant
coffee
flavor
on
the
pallet
the
bitterness
form
the
coffee
and
hops
blend
well
together
and
there
is
a
very
pleasant
after
taste
the
makes
the
desire
for
another
sip
d
very
drinkable
this
would
definitely
be
one
that
i
could
drink
several
of
in
a
sitting
if
it
was
distributed
to
ca
notes
great
beer
but
i
think
that
i
enjoyed
the
taste
a
little
more
on
tap
unfortunately
i
wasnt
able
to
write
my
review
down
so
the
bottle
will
have
to
do
for
now
d
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
and
has
plenty
of
coffee
flavor
definitely
recommended
for
those
who
like
coffee
augmented
beer
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
sandy
colored
head
could
have
used
a
bit
more
head
retention
andor
lacing
but
it
was
good
enough
in
my
estimation
smells
of
bitter
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
these
aromas
are
present
in
the
flavor
profile
as
well
and
give
the
overall
impression
of
chocolate
covered
espresso
beans
the
roasted
bitterness
is
present
but
restrained
and
balanced
to
perfection
with
the
hop
bitterness
lightbodied
with
a
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
mouthcoating
malt
presence
definitely
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
ive
had
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
could
definitely
see
myself
having
this
one
again
once
again
bells
has
lived
up
to
their
reputation
this
is
a
definite
musttry
coffee
stout
d
im
not
sure
what
was
up
with
the
cigarette
thing
but
i
think
it
ruins
what
is
otherwise
a
pretty
solid
coffee
stout
maybe
ill
try
it
again
in
the
future
d
very
good
example
of
style
pretty
complex
nose
and
taste
spot
on
coffee
stout
drinkability
nice
flavors
near
perfect
for
a
cool
night
rather
filling
and
the
abv
is
a
tad
high
for
more
than
one
though
d
if
you
dont
enjoy
coffee
look
elsewhere
for
those
of
us
who
do
java
stout
is
a
must
this
is
definitely
a
coffee
beer
not
just
a
beer
with
coffee
delicious
looked
like
i
poured
a
cup
of
coffee
into
my
pint
glass
other
than
the
noticeably
thicker
viscosity
and
the
half
finger
of
dark
tan
head
really
has
a
coffee
aroma
along
with
some
bitter
chocolate
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
although
i
felt
there
was
a
hint
of
chocolate
brownies
in
there
as
well
velvety
smooth
going
down
i
like
strong
black
coffee
hot
and
iced
so
this
was
right
up
my
alley
i
did
notice
some
alcohol
on
the
backend
but
nothing
overt
d
this
was
the
first
coffee
beer
i
ever
had
and
its
still
one
of
the
best
d
true
to
its
name
java
stout
brings
together
the
best
of
coffee
and
beer
in
a
classic
way
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
wish
it
was
readily
available
another
good
beer
from
bells
d
a
pretty
sessionable
coffee
stout
drinkability
this
coffee
stout
is
a
good
blend
of
coffee
and
beer
the
coffee
is
not
too
strong
that
it
dominates
the
rest
of
the
flavors
but
compliments
them
well
drinkability
terrible
i
could
barely
finish
this
im
so
sad
i
have
another
one
of
these
in
my
fridge
i
cant
stand
to
pour
things
down
the
drain
so
im
already
annoyed
that
im
going
to
eventually
force
myself
to
drink
the
second
bottle
some
night
for
any
kind
of
coffee
stout
its
relatively
drinkable
like
real
coffee
you
dont
want
to
guzzle
itand
i
realize
thats
not
necessarily
what
drinkability
means
still
this
beverage
is
probably
better
sampled
with
friends
than
poured
as
a
single
serving
this
is
hands
down
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
i
have
ever
had
i
love
every
bit
of
this
and
then
some
this
is
a
coffee
stout
j
cheers
d
an
easy
sipper
that
i
actually
enjoy
a
bit
more
on
the
cold
side
even
though
it
was
a
small
bottle
i
would
have
prefered
to
share
it
because
the
sweetness
was
a
bit
more
than
i
usually
like
d
this
beer
is
great
in
the
first
half
and
a
bit
of
a
let
down
in
the
second
that
is
each
sip
starts
thick
full
flavored
and
complex
but
finishes
a
bit
dusty
dry
and
one
dimensional
if
it
were
not
for
the
jeykl
and
hyde
aspects
of
this
beer
it
would
rank
up
there
with
some
of
the
better
coffee
beers
out
there
easy
enough
to
drink
one
of
but
honestly
they
priced
me
right
out
of
ever
really
going
after
this
one
again
a
solid
beer
but
i
have
had
far
better
within
the
style
d
a
decent
coffee
stout
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
this
one
is
a
bit
onedimensional
and
even
that
dimension
isnt
all
that
wonderful
dont
get
me
wrong
though
this
is
still
a
pretty
good
beer
its
just
not
as
good
as
it
could
be
drinkability
i
could
have
three
not
six
this
has
got
a
near
perfect
coffee
taste
and
what
i
envision
when
i
think
coffeestout
bells
knows
how
to
make
pleasing
stouts
d
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
for
the
abv
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
at
all
dry
on
the
palate
which
turns
slightly
chalky
which
more
or
less
works
with
the
flavor
profile
but
which
i
dont
care
much
for
medium
to
full
in
body
but
light
enough
to
make
it
quite
drinkable
very
enjoyable
mouth
is
heavily
bodied
and
viscous
i
would
say
its
undercarbonated
but
the
bitterness
doesnt
allow
much
more
drinks
slowly
but
its
a
damn
fine
beer
the
only
downfall
is
the
drinkability
its
delicious
but
the
overwhelming
coffee
taste
makes
this
one
to
take
slow
and
savor
it
dark
brownblack
poured
into
a
chimay
chalice
thick
with
an
inch
or
so
of

smell
is

therefore
i
love
this
beer

is

by

at

feel
bad
that
it
had
to
follow
a

and
vanilla
body
is
cranberries
though
it
snaps
just
a
little
this
one
also
has
good
texture
and
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
coffee
stout
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
some
of
the
finer
coffee
stouts
on
the
market
the
coffee
is
there
and
not
cloying
but
i
was
happy
to
get
a
chance
at
one
but
happy
it
ended
there

the
taste
is

there
is
no
mistaking
the
fact
that
this
is
a
coffee
stout
the
nose
is
absolutely
full
of
it
it
smells
like
dark
chocolate
covered
coffee
beans
literally
this
stout
is
packed
full
of
java
i
also
get
some
bitter
chocolate
but
i
would
definitely
enjoy
1
or

think
that
if
you
are
big

with
mahogany
edges
and
a
huge
frothy

roasted
malty
aroma
with
lots
of
coffee
as
well
as
some

the
amount
of
coffee
bitterness
is
a
bit
too
strong
in
my
opinion
it
makes
it
hard
to
have
more
than
just
the
one
if
youre
a
coffee
nut
this
was
a
welcomed
break
if
drinking
these
in
succession
i
am
sure
they
will
catch
up
rather
quickly
with
a
7

alcohol
plus
the
richness
of
the
flavors
might
tire
you
out
after

you

i
know
that
you
will

it
is
really

there
you
straight

coffee

will
notice
the
similarities
between
the
color

this

it
had
a
thin
layer

tan

foam
that
dissipated
away
in
a
matter
of
a
few
seconds
and
into
a
few
tan
rings
and
tan
colored
bubbles
that
acted
as
its
lace
around
the

the
beer
smelled

walked
into

coffee
house
while
they
were
brewing
a
chocolate
flavored
coffee
or
espresso
no

mouthfeel
is

lasts
very

to
have
several
in

my
favorite
session
coffee
stout
this
is
made
for
a
coffee
drinker
hence
the
name
so
if
you
dont
like
coffee
stay
away
otherwise
this
is
a
nice
java
stout
and
a
fairly
solid
offering
medium
to
full
bodied
but
quite
smooth
with
alcohol
completely
hidden
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
several
of
these
due
to
the
infusion
of
coffee
but
something
i
would
drink
again
id
even
recommend
this
to
coffeehaters

to
its

i
have
ever
had
i
liked
it
and
would
drink
it
again

definately
not
all

thanks
go
out

beer

a

the
beer
pours
very
dark

with
a
half
inch
tan
head
whoa
you
can
really
smell
the
coffee
in
this
beer
i
can
also
smell
some
malt
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
but
coffee
is
the
main
smell
by
far
taste
is
mostly
coffee
with
some
maltchocolate
sweetness
at
first
then
the
coffee
taste
kicks
in
and
finishes
with
a
slight
lingering
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
slick
and
the
body
is
medium
but
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
drinkability
is
good
its
nice
and
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
if
you
like
coffee
youll
like
this
beer
i
think
its
pretty
decent
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
23
in
a
sitting
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
mouthfeel

bleh
taste
is
ye

stout
with
a
touch
of
coffee
maybe
not
in
your
face
coffee
taste
like
speedway
more
of
a
it
says
java
on
the
label
so
i
must
be
tasting
coffee
taste
carbonation
is
high
mouthfeel
is
thin
alcohol
is
a
bit
more
noticeable
than
it
should
be
not
going
back
to
this
one
as
if
you
couldnt
tell
from
my
review
heretofore
it
is
not
too
particularly
drinkable
i
will
not
buy
any
more
of
this
after
my
six
pack
is
finished
i
knew
i
should
have
topped
off
my
case
with
an
additional
hopslam
or
expedition
dark
as
concentrated
coffee
with
a
tan
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
the
smell
is
of
old
coffee
gone
cold
with
the
mix
of
choclate
tones
and
some
pleasent
soft
sweetness
the
flavor
comes
out
strong
of
coffee
but
fades
to
roasty
burnt
flavors
with
a
lift
of
malt
the
body
is
a
little
thinner
than
most
stouts
but
it
works
with
the
coffee
premiss
truly
a
better
option
than
redbull
and
vodka
to
get
a
little
perk
in
a
session
bottle

johnnym2002
full
bodied
with
a
creamy
but
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
dthe
ultimate
coffee
experience
now
this
is
a
beer
to
start
your
day
off
on
the
right
foot
nevermind
that
now
open
it
pours
a
deep
rich
rubyblack
color
with
a
burnt
orange
head
which
clings
to
the
glass
in
a
unformulaic
webbed
pattern
its
bubbly
too
with
a
lot
of
noticeable
carbonation
at
the
bottom
of
the
brew
my
premonition
however
did
not
come
true
because
the
coffee
smell
here
is
nice
but
not
overwhelming
not
enough
to
penetrate
the
bottle
prior
to
opening
wishful
thinking
on
my
part
perhaps
but
there
is
a
coffeechocolate
aroma
here
with
hints
of
smoke
wood
and
dark
fruit
not
an
unpleasant
aroma
but
nothing
special
but
everything
comes
together
in
the
taste
the
coffee
taste
is
powerful
but
spoton
mellows
out
with
chocolate
and
some
vanilla
flavoring
sweet
and
malty
up
front
but
finishes
with
some
balancing
hops
as
well
this
is
kinda
like
eating
a
chocolatecovered
coffee
bean
with
a
patch
of
dried
fruit
sitting
in
your
cheek
sturdy
mouthfeel
that
develops
more
as
the
beer
rises
to
room
temp
not
everyone
is
going
to
like
this
beer
but
if
youre
a
fan
of
stouts
you
should
give
this
a
try
and
especially
if
you
like
coffeeflavored
stouts
this
ranks
among
the
top
in
that
category
another
welldone
brew
by
bells
looks
like
well
it
looks
like
a
stout
in
a
glass
smells
like
cherryrum
pipe
tobacco
chocolate
and
suede
it
tastes
a
little
leathery
and
musty
funky
with
notes
of
coconut
infused
rum
or
is
it
rum
soaked
curried
nuts
there
is
a
faint
coffeelike
roast
on
the
finish
and
im
getting
a
lot
of
nuances
that
one
normally
finds
in
a
bourbonbarrel
stout
i
have
to
say
this
beer
is
really
commanding
my
full
attention
mediumfull
body
with
sweetness
flirting
with
the
bitterness
it
goes
back
and
forth
before
finishing
bitter
this
is
something
i
only
want
one
of
but
not
because
its
too
filling
or
heavy
or
rich
etc
but
just
because
it
delivers
so
much
on
my
senses
all
around
that
one
is
enough
to
get
the
idea
i
get
it
good
idea
i
think
its
sumatran
coffee
which
explains
the
earthy
leathery
funkiness
rad
overall
a
good
niche
beer
especially
if
coffee
is
your
thing
this
is
a
really
great
coffee
stout
very
enjoyable
drinkability
enjoyable
just
like
a
decent
cup
of
coffee
is
enjoyable
but
it
fails
the
complexity
test
i
wouldnt
advise
this
for
your
last
beer
of
the
night
as
im
pretty
sure
the
coffee
is
enough
to
keep
you
up
for
at
least
a
bit
i
have
to
wonder
how
this
would
taste
on
tap
i
can
just
imagine
the
intensity
of
the
flavors
would
just
be
off
the
chart
superb
drinkability
lots
of
coffee
and
dark
roasted
malts
all
the
flavors
work
well
together
and
the
aroma
is
really
inviting
pretty
easy
to
put
down
a
few
if
i
wanted
to
and
definately
something
i
would
pick
up
again
i
find
this
somewhat
similar
to
the
terrapin
wakenbake
stout
i
normally
get
down
here
i
think
ill
try
a
sidebyside
with
my
remaining
bottle
of
this
oelergud
the
beer
poured
a
syrupy
black
back
that
had
an
ever
so
slight
brown
head
to
it
which
dissipated
rather
quickly
the
aroma
was
nothing
more
then
just
coffee
well
there
also
was
a
slight
presence
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
but
mainly
it
was
an
overwhelming
aroma
of
coffee
the
taste
was
to
no
suprise
coffee
all
i
could
figure
out
in
the
taste
was
coffee
with
some
alcohol
if
i
have
a
coffee
stout
i
would
like
the
nose
and
the
taste
to
have
at
least
a
little
hint
of
stout
the
beer
moved
slowly
over
my
tounge
the
way
a
double
stout
should
with
a
slight
alcohol
warming
to
it
this
beer
left
me
rather
unimpressed
and
not
wanting
another
one
draft
at
kclingers
tavern
hanover
pa
what
a
beauty
this
emits
a
perfect
coffee
aroma
and
the
beers
flavor
is
like
sweet
coffee
from
starbucks
even
my
nonbeer
drinking
friend
loved
it
lightly
bittered
cold
coffee
in
a
glass
excellent
stout
if
you
like
the
coffeeflavored
variety

the
pour
into
my
sam
smith
pint
raises
a
negligible
head
the
color
of
creamed
coffee
it
fades
to
an
even
smaller
glass
ring
after
only
a
few
seconds
lacing
is
spotty
but
stubborn
the
body
is
utterly
black
the
nose
is
bursting
with
rich
bittersweet
coffee
aroma
and
for
my
nose
thats
it
it
smells
like
concentrated
cold
coffee
pleasant
though
the
taste
has
more
to
it
than
the
smell
the
coffee
flavor
is
not
alldominant
but
still
of
course
a
huge
portion
of
the
flavor
profile
there
are
definite
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
flavors
hiding
behind
the
coffee
there
is
a
very
nice
lasting
bitter
coffee
flavor
in
the
back
of
the
throat
too
i
feel
that
the
heavy
body
and
lighter
carbonation
make
this
beer
sit
perfectly
in
the
mouth
a
fine
beer
one
that
i
probably
will
revisit
after
this
first
sixer
this
isnt
as
complex
as
a
beer
as
i
expected
based
on
my
past
experiences
with
bells
products
not
as
much
going
on
but
the
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
flavors
are
still
very
tasty
thanks
to
melbatoast93
for
sending
this
back
in
october
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
really
enjoy
coffee
beers
id
love
to
try
this
beer
with
a
different
roast
applied
to
the
coffee
beans
used
or
a
different
bean
it
would
be
cool
to
see
a
brewer
do
a
coffee
stout
series
with
different
beans
time
to
fire
up
the
homebrew
kit
medium
bodied
an
ok
stout
but
i
think
they
failed
to
give
this
beer
a
really
pleasant
coffee
character
d
its
pretty
much
burnt
coffee
but
with
some
stout
characteristics
added
to
it
thats
what
they
were
going
for
and
thats
what
they
got
it
did
not
wow
me
in
any
way
which
let
me
down
a
bit
i
love
coffee
and
thought
i
would
love
this
beer
sadly
i
did
not
not
bad
but
a
pass
in
my
book
wow
i
personally
found
this
brew
outstanding
it
reminds
me
of
being
in
miami
and
ordering
a
shot
of
cuban
expresso
coffee
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
3
inch
mocha
brown
head
that
fully
lasted
throughout
the
drink
also
left
a
excellent
amount
of
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
was
an
intense
expresso
coffee
with
a
hint
of
molasses
and
licorice
the
flavor
was
long
lasting
and
coffee
bitter
sweet
from
start
to
finish
felt
thck
full
body
creamy
softly
carbonated
with
a
small
hint
of
alcohol
overall
i
could
drink
this
all
day
which
i
did
and
i
cant
wait
to
get
back
to
columbus
to
buy
some
more
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
i
remember
it
being
much
more
smoother
but
then
again
i
also
remember
when
i
could
fit
into
a
size
32
waist
pair
of
pants
quite
drinkable
considering
the
abv
but
hardley
a
session
beer
another
fantastic
stout
from
bells
youve
got
to
be
a
coffee
drinker
to
like
this
one
though
1
99
for
a
single
pours
well
black
as
a
stout
should
head
retention
is
lacking
though
aroma
is
well
coffee
like
roasty
slightly
sweet
perhaps
as
well
taste
is
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
expresso
that
shows
up
stronger
in
the
finish
its
a
good
beer
its
solid
but
lacking
alot
of
character
that
i
have
come
to
expect
from
big
stouts
overall
first
off
coffee
stouts
are
my
thing
this
version
has
monster
coffee
taste
with
a
chocolate
finish
but
the
strength
of
the
coffee
overshadows
other
tastes
tasty
and
drinkable
overall
d
if
you
love
coffee
this
is
the
brew
for
you
drink
it
with
breakfast
or
for
a
late
night
eye
opener
it
doesnt
matter
because
this
beer
is
good
any
time
of
the
day
not
a
session
beer
as
it
is
thick
and
rich
but
damn
good
none
the
less
bottle
received
in
a
trade
from
hoppymeal
many
thanks
batch
number
7221
im
assuming
this
is
from
last
winter
deep
darkchocolate
brown
with
a
lovely
light
brown
mocha
head
no
light
gets
through
but
this
still
retains
a
definitively
brown
hue
as
opposed
to
out
and
out
black
huge
dark
roasted
coffee
aroma
earthy
and
slightly
burnt
with
a
thick
hersheys
dark
chocolate
syrup
backbone
and
some
slight
toffee
notes
this
is
getting
me
pretty
excited
as
the
nose
is
really
reminding
me
of
the
heavenly
scent
of
founders
kentucky
breakfast
stout
okay
so
kybs
it
is
not
but
it
is
certainly
a
delicious
coffee
stout
roasted
grounds
bite
the
palate
bitterly
right
away
and
linger
to
strafe
the
tastebuds
throughout
the
swallow
there
is
a
mildly
astringent
black
malt
flavor
in
the
middle
which
approaches
the
point
of
sourness
until
it
is
overtaken
by
the
dark
bitterness
of
the
coffee
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
of
the
chocolate
i
detected
in
the
aroma
appearing
in
the
taste
for
that
reason
id
say
that
unless
you
like
rather
like
coffee
as
i
do
this
may
come
across
as
sort
of
onedimensional
as
it
warms
a
bit
of
oak
character
emerges
but
it
still
doesnt
make
up
for
the
chocolate
the
nose
led
me
to
expect
despite
this
the
flavor
is
quite
tasty
all
told
light
in
body
for
the
style
and
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
making
for
a
very
drinkable
coffee
stout
definitely
fits
the
bill
when
in
the
mood
for
a
coffeeinfused
beer
more
so
at
least
than
any
other
coffee
beer
ive
tried
d
i
like
the
black
majic
better
as
this
is
a
little
sweet
for
me
but
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
appears
black
with
a
big
brown
head
some
lacing
smells
of
fresh
brewed
coffee
tastes
like
straight
up
black
coffee
very
smooth
and
tangy
from
the
coffee
overload
a
nice
drinkable
beer
that
i
wont
mind
having
again
and
i
dont
even
like
coffee
drinkability
can
be
an
adventure
but
a
fun
adventure
heavy
intense
cofee
flavors
without
much
sweetness
is
not
for
the
meak
it
will
grow
hair
on
your
chest
i
really
enjoyed
it
not
sure
how
many
i
could
drink
but
id
have
it
during
any
breakfast
black
with
ruby
highlights
around
edges
of
glass
creamy
tan
head
dissipates
to
leave
a
thin
ring
around
the
rim
huge
coffee
smell
no
surprise
there
that
taste
pretty
much
overpowers
everything
else
heavy
and
deep
dark
roasted
coffee
with
a
slight
chocolately
aftertaste
followed
up
with
a
long
and
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
was
on
the
chalkier
side
tough
one
for
me
to
get
through
but
is
unique
for
a
stout
to
have
this
flavor
respectable
for
what
it
is
my
least
favorite
stout
so
far
but
i
am
not
a
coffee
drinker
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
a
little
bit
filling
this
one
is
a
perfect
sipper
but
you
can
still
knock
a
few
back
fairly
quickly
another
excellent
bells
product
this
is
a
coffee
stout
that
lives
up
to
its
billing
this
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
a
very
substantial
and
slow
fading
head
it
smells
strongly
of
coffeeand
not
just
any
coffee
this
brew
smells
just
like
a
fine
espresso
and
tastes
a
good
bit
like
one
as
well
other
coffee
brewed
beers
will
have
an
undernote
of
coffee
but
this
one
puts
its
beans
up
front
the
result
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
that
drinks
a
bit
heavy
but
fully
satisfies
in
the
flavor
department
this
a
great
stout
from
bellsit
blows
away
the
cherry
stout
from
bells
that
i
drank
last
night
anybody
that
loves
stout
must
try
this
beer
expensive
sixpack
but
worth
it
poured
from
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
black
opaque
with
a
nice
two
finger
sudsy
head
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
the
initial
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
of
coffee
followed
by
a
slightly
alcoholic
smooth
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
slight
amount
of
creamy
carbonation
the
overall
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
actually
higher
than
what
i
had
expected
not
a
bad
brew
for
better
or
for
worse
this
a
love
it
or
sort
of
like
it
kind
of
beer
its
the
latter
for
me
a
noncoffee
drinker
if
you
have
that
java
monkey
on
your
back
when
you
wake
up
in
the
morning
and
if
you
have
the
day
off
i
cant
imagine
a
better
way
to
start
the
day
than
with
a
bottle
of
bells
java
stout
ill
stick
with
kalamazoo
and
expedition
though
thanks
cheers
d
the
bottom
line
if
youre
a
coffee
drinker
youll
love
this
stout
if
not
find
something
else
to
drink

d
i
recently
fell
into
a
small
stockpile
of
bells
through
trades
and
a
beer
expedition
to
westys
with
akorsak
after
trying
all
of
them
this
is
my
favorite
i
also
found
it
to
be
a
good
accompaniment
to
meals
not
just
with
or
in
place
of
dessert
if
you
have
the
opportunity
pick
some
up
verdict
i
have
now
gone
through
two
6packs
before
reviewing
this
beer
i
had
no
clue
it
was
at
7
5
abv
i
have
found
one
of
my
new
favorites
a
great
balance
of
coffee
and
beer
i
like
beers
that
are
more
coffee
than
beer
but
their
drinkablity
is
greatly
reduced
because
of
this
java
stout
goes
down
so
well
i
keep
looking
at
my
glass
and
going
oh
crap
i
am
already
more
than
half
done
d
an
excellent
choice
to
start
thanksgiving
big
and
bold
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
coffee
intensity
and
roasted
depth
of
the
stout
sitting
on
this
for
year
was
a
good
idea
if
you
like
coffee
and
not
beer
this
is
you
if
you
like
beer
but
not
coffee
forget
it
if
you
like
beer
but
hate
coffee
dont
even
try
but
i
would
say
this
is
a
definite
recommend
and
also
a
nice
rebound
from
the
hell
hath
no
furry
this
thing
is
all
coffee
all
coffee
it
pours
black
with
a
nice
tan
rocky
head
that
sticks
around
there
is
no
malt
no
hops
just
coffee
really
just
coffee
it
is
a
nice
drinking
beer
and
was
shocked
to
see
it
listed
with
such
a
high
abv
must
be
sneaky
because
there
is
just
a
slight
hint
of
it
in
the
back
a
nice
beer
but
for
me
not
one
to
drink
one
after
another
filled
from
the
growler
station
at
the
party
source
in
bellevue
kentucky
this
is
absoultely
pitch
black
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
great
head
retention
aroma
is
huge
on
coffee
not
quite
to
espresso
but
well
roasted
and
earthy
the
first
delight
is
the
mouthfeel
this
baby
is
thick
and
creamy
coffee
and
cream
flavors
play
well
together
big
and
robust
but
well
balanced
finishes
with
mocha
flavors
nice
patches
of
lace
coat
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
it
is
drank
this
is
a
gem
if
you
dont
like
coffee
you
may
not
like
this
i
do
and
did
very
well
made
another
solid
beer
from
bells
aquired
this
stout
in
a
trade
with
bigern
served
slightly
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
deep
shiny
black
that
no
light
could
pass
through
came
up
with
about
an
inch
of
creamy
coffee
browntan
head
that
had
decent
retention
and
left
generous
amounts
of
lace
on
my
glass
smelled
strongly
of
burnt
coffee
mocha
and
some
hints
of
sweet
toffee
tasted
of
bitter
roasted
coffee
chocolate
slight
notes
of
black
licorice
nice
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
rather
drinkable
fours
across
the
board
wow
what
a
wonderful
beer
these
have
been
sitting
in
my
closet
a
couple
of
months
and
they
might
even
be
better
fresh
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
this
wonderful
brew
do
so
good
brew
for
those
that
like
coffee
a
lot
this
is
a
great
brew
for
those
of
us
that
arent
into
coffee
that
much
either
cant
thank
mynie
enough
for
the
bottle
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
soon
even
if
i
have
to
drive
to
kalamazoo
myself
i
am
not
a
fan
of
coffee
and
have
only
drunk
about
5
or
6
cups
my
entire
life
its
not
that
i
dont
like
it
mixed
with
milk
and
sugar
but
my
reasoning
is
why
drink
something
if
you
have
to
dilute
it
and
change
its
whole
natureof
course
this
doesnt
apply
to
beer
id
much
rather
just
drink
a
pepsi
well
now
a
diet
pepsi
i
dont
mind
it
at
as
an
additive
or
flavoring
and
thus
my
like
for
it
in
beer
this
however
is
too
much
usually
with
coffee
stouts
there
is
a
balance
with
chocolate
andor
smokiness
but
this
is
overpowering
smoky
coffee
to
the
extreme
not
a
bad
flavor
at
all
just
too
much
of
it
kind
of
like
knocking
knickers
with
a
starbucks
expresso
machine
now
that
youve
knocked
it
up
you
have
to
take
care
of
your
little
java
tar
baby
for
the
next
18
years
all
right
thats
a
bit
dramatic
the
next
18
seconds
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
marked
batch
7170
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
a
syrupy
opaque
blackishbrown
with
a
thin
dark
beige
ring
of
head
that
quickly
fell
away
to
a
light
tan
circle
of
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
rich
deep
and
dark
coffee
aromas
with
some
strong
roasty
malt
character
present
sweet
chocolaty
notes
finish
out
the
nose
taste
is
hardhitting
huge
coffee
and
espresso
sinfully
decadent
rich
and
bold
roasty
malts
and
chocolate
slightly
drying
bitter
aftertaste
just
like
a
good
cup
of
coffee
mouthfeel
is
heavy
fullbodied
profile
with
a
syrupy
viscosity
that
just
coats
the
mouth
as
it
goes
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
levels
of
the
spectrum
slight
tickle
on
the
tongue
is
the
only
noticeable
carbonation
present
drinkability
is
great
very
satisifying
rich
stout
hardly
hints
towards
the
7
5
abv
would
purchase
again
i
recommend
it
fresh
roasted
coffee
more
like
espresso
again
those
edys
chocolate
chips
come
to
mind
overpowers
the
palate
no
cream
like
taste
to
this
one
just
pure
caffeinated
java
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
midsip
finish
is
exactly
like
that
of
coffee
bitter
and
drying
by
far
the
most
intense
coffee
flavor
ive
encountered
in
a
beer
pours
dark
with
a
nice
tan
laced
head
you
can
smell
the
roasted
coffee
from
the
first
pour
the
first
taste
is
an
immediate
blast
of
strong
java
then
smooths
out
with
the
alcohol
and
comingled
chocolate
there
is
a
strong
roasted
java
taste
left
on
the
palate
after
every
drink
although
the
coffee
taste
kind
of
kicks
you
in
the
mouth
its
quite
drinkable
ive
had
a
whole
growler
of
this
beer
a
nice
stout
to
occasionally
drink
but
not
something
i
would
put
in
the
weekly
rotation
if
you
like
coffee
stouts
this
is
a
must
try
this
is
drinkable
like
desert
but
drinkable
like
a
port
its
not
a
session
beer
but
is
drinkable
in
its
own
right
like
having
a
chocolate
mousse
and
cappucino
for
desert
yummy
thank
you
felonious
i
must
find
more
of
this
one
overall
this
is
very
good
and
i
would
love
another
one
sometime
pours
black
yet
still
has
an
unmistakable
brown
hue
to
pair
with
a
brown
head
coffee
overwhelms
the
aroma
and
when
you
finally
take
a
sip
you
think
you
are
drinking
a
nice
cup
of
joe
just
without
the
caffine
and
warmth
burnt
flavor
doesnt
emerge
until
the
end
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
than
you
might
expect
for
one
of
bells
stouts
but
a
spot
on
match
for
a
coffee
beverage
the
thing
is
that
even
when
you
exhale
you
still
get
more
coffee
flavor
i
dont
think
this
is
the
most
drinkable
beer
on
the
market
but
from
the
other
coffee
stouts
i
have
tried
it
is
delicious
and
i
would
not
mind
having
another
nice
effort
it
is
just
that
the
style
begs
the
question
why
dont
you
simply
order
a
nice
warm
cup
of
joe
drinkability
very
drinkable
if
you
like
coffee
and
i
do
this
one
is
a
winner
pours
out
very
dark
with
a
nice
tan
head
leaving
a
good
lacing
and
plenty
of
head
stays
on
top
the
name
says
it
all
this
one
definately
smells
rich
of
coffee
if
you
dont
care
for
coffee
it
might
be
too
strong
but
to
me
it
smells
awesome
taste
starts
with
a
bit
of
coffee
and
then
some
sort
of
green
flavor
comes
in
not
strong
but
i
can
only
seem
to
describe
it
as
fresh
vegetables
straight
from
the
garden
then
the
taste
shifts
back
into
a
bitter
chocolate
flavor
before
joining
back
up
with
the
coffee
for
a
chococoffee
finish
medhigh
carbonation
thin
little
bubbles
bounce
around
on
the
tongue
light
bodied
and
pretty
dry
mouthfeel
doesnt
say
double
stout
says
more
irish
dry
stout
to
me
i
imagine
this
would
be
nice
just
about
any
time
during
the
day
breakfast
would
fit
in
well
with
this
but
it
becomes
a
bit
cloying
by
the
end
one
bottle
would
be
enough
definately
worthy
of
a
try
and
i
could
see
myself
having
more
but
probably
wouldnt
break
my
regular
lineup
pours
deep
sludgy
black
with
minimal
head
the
liquid
rolls
around
almost
like
mercury
dark
chocolates
and
ground
espresso
beans
on
the
nose
some
creamy
milky
smells
in
there
too
but
the
emphasis
is
on
dry
and
dusty
coffee
grounds
sweetandbitter
up
front
but
the
sweetness
fades
from
its
high
dextrin
level
to
a
faint
faint
backdrop
to
the
dry
bitter
espresso
notes
the
finish
is
all
coffee
and
it
feels
like
coffee
in
the
mouth
i
imagine
that
hardcore
coffeeespresso
fans
would
be
big
fans
of
this
but
for
others
the
coffee
bitterness
is
too
unattentuated
by
malt
or
other
sweetness
to
be
very
drinkable
bells
java
stout
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
brown
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
coffee
dominates
the
aroma
the
flavor
has
a
nice
coffe
aftertaste
some
nuttiness
and
some
strange
green
flavor
almost
like
green
pepper
but
not
green
coffee
perhaps
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
coffee
flavored
stouts
pours
black
with
a
good
size
creamy
light
brown
head
strong
smell
of
roasted
coffee
beans
and
a
dry
smokiness
most
of
the
sweetness
from
the
malts
gets
lost
in
the
coffee
aroma
however
there
is
a
little
chocolate
and
also
a
little
black
licorice
sweetness
not
overly
anise
flavored
but
just
a
hint
taste
is
a
tangy
milky
sweetness
up
front
with
a
dry
slightly
bitter
roasted
coffee
finish
a
little
acidicnesssourness
in
the
coffee
aftertaste
as
well
medium
bodied
and
creamy
alcohol
is
hidden
completely
very
good
breakfast
style
stout
the
coffee
flavors
and
aromas
come
through
well
im
not
sure
i
could
do
more
than
two
or
three
of
these
before
the
coffee
taste
would
wear
on
my
palette
not
to
mention
the
alcohol
content
but
a
very
nice
treat
excellent
bottle
conditioning
paste
on
the
bottom
a
good
swirling
brought
up
all
the
yeast
goodies
for
a
splendid
ending
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
for
the
coffee
lover
no
head
very
dark
and
syrupy
looking
lots
of
lacing
enough
to
comment
on
at
least
looks
very
dark
and
think
and
tasty
whoo
this
beer
smells
more
like
coffee
than
any
toher
ive
had
sweet
fresh
coffee
beans
with
some
dark
chocolate
odors
too
super
coffee
flavor
very
sweet
too
kind
of
like
a
cold
expresso
with
3
spoonfuls
of
sugar
and
some
cream
just
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
either
from
hops
or
coffee
its
hard
to
tell
vey
thick
and
fun
to
drink
one
of
my
favorites
from
bells
which
is
saying
something
low
carbonation
full
body
very
rich
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
just
as
it
should
be
for
this
beer
very
satisfying
this
is
a
beer
for
the
coffee
lover
actually
this
is
a
beer
for
anyone
since
i
dont
like
coffee
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
ill
start
drinking
this
in
the
morning
a
flavorful
and
bold
blend
of
roasted
goodness
keeping
with
the
stylings
of
the
bells
stout
clan
there
is
a
substantial
sweetness
but
i
find
it
blends
well
with
the
heap
o
roastedness
a
substantial
brew
great
beer
m
d
mouthfeel
is
awesome
silky
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
slight
carbonation
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
in
the
nose
which
gives
way
to
a
bitter
burnt
coffee
finish
drinkability
is
high
provided
you
like
the
taste
of
coffee
what
a
wonderful
tasting
stout
i
could
have
one
of
these
for
breakfast
and
it
would
rival
an
iced
coffee
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
nearly
full
body
the
beer
is
almost
balanced
the
beer
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
quaffable
beer
i
enjoyed
this
from
start
to
finish
d
high
a
coffee
drinkers
beer
if
i
were
a
coffee
drinker
id
like
this
more
as
i
am
not
and
still
like
it
alot
must
count
for
something
well
done
bells
taste
espresso
black
malt
and
dark
chocolate
this
beer
does
have
a
strong
astringency
in
my
mouth
and
leaves
it
feeling
very
dry
i
love
the
beers
made
by
bells
but
i
have
to
say
i
call
the
balance
of
this
beer
into
question
the
burnt
flavor
is
almost
a
little
over
the
top
next
time
ill
just
pick
up
two
packs
of
the
expedition
stout
poured
as
dark
as
the
night
with
a
mocha
colored
head
that
was
thick
and
left
behind
rings
of
lacing
the
high
viscosity
of
the
beer
was
apparent
as
soon
as
i
poured
it
very
appealing
big
bold
bubbles
were
scattered
about
the
surface
giving
it
a
frothy
look
aromas
of
slow
roasted
coffee
brown
sugar
fresh
bread
and
malt
seemed
evident
the
taste
was
dominated
by
expressolike
flavors
with
bitter
coffee
dominating
the
initial
and
end
of
each
sip
in
between
was
a
creamy
and
slighly
chewy
blast
of
sweetness
great
depth
and
flavors
like
having
a
beer
and
coffee
at
the
same
time
but
in
a
good
way
over
time
the
sweetness
became
more
dominant
and
near
the
end
of
my
pint
it
was
too
rich
to
fully
enjoy
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
have
more
than
an
pint
or
two
of
this
so
the
drinkability
takes
a
hit
drinkability
is
ok
lots
of
java
aromas
and
flavors
but
overall
not
a
big
stout
and
not
much
going
on
except
the
java
if
in
the
mood
for
a
coffee
stout
i
would
look
elsewhere
if
i
could
get
the
good
stuff
in
tenn
very
dark
brown
with
a
mediumsized
dark
tan
slowly
diminishing
head
the
smell
and
taste
are
both
dominated
by
coffee
i
know
thats
the
point
of
a
java
stout
but
i
think
this
was
taken
just
a
little
too
far
theres
an
excellent
chocolaty
sweet
malt
presence
in
there
which
id
like
to
be
able
to
see
a
little
more
of
in
this
beer
its
still
a
good
beer
just
nothing
stellar
and
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
mean
coffee
very
nice
mouthfeel
though
black
with
mahogany
highlights
the
beer
looked
thick
as
it
poured
out
of
the
bottle
thin
dark
brown
head
even
after
agitation
spotty
lacing
rich
roasted
coffee
ground
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
nuttiness
peeking
through
coffee
flavour
and
bitterness
throughout
theres
a
bit
of
milk
chocolate
sweetness
in
there
as
well
low
carbonation
creamy
texture
full
body
quite
luxurious
very
enjoyable
even
for
someone
who
doesnt
drink
coffee
me
intense
coffee
character
makes
this
beer
less
than
complex
but
it
does
exactly
what
it
sets
out
to
do
and
in
fine
form
perfect
for
after
diner
or
a
rainy
afternoon
this
is
more
coffee
then
stout
it
pours
like
an
ice
coffee
with
only
a
thin
dark
leathery
head
earthy
and
roasted
nut
overtones
come
more
from
the
coffee
then
the
malt
i
think
i
will
save
a
couple
bottles
for
use
in
the
ice
cream
machine
yummmm
i
really
recommend
giving
this
a
try
but
make
sure
it
isnt
too
cold
if
you
love
stouts
then
you
should
seek
this
one
out
right
now
you
dont
know
what
you
are
missing
this
is
a
quirky
brew
in
your
face
unapologetic
it
doesnt
get
my
money
back
guarantee
offer
because
i
dont
know
if
you
have
the
same
tastes
i
do
but
i
will
say
that
if
you
dig
coffee
seek
this
one
out
it
might
just
be
your
fetish
like
it
is
for
me
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
medium
tan
1
finger
head
in
a
snifter
glass
head
is
loose
and
drops
to
a
thin
cap
after
a
couple
of
minutes
aroma
is
huge
coffee
maybe
more
coffee
aroma
here
than
in
any
other
beer
ive
experienced
once
you
get
past
the
coffee
theres
also
a
big
burned
roasty
and
woody
aroma
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
at
random
points
during
the
drink
unbelievable
fresh
coffee
bean
aroma
if
you
couldnt
have
guessed
this
also
tastes
like
crazy
coffee
there
is
a
decent
hop
bitterness
to
balance
and
a
nice
chocolatey
malty
finish
nice
how
its
just
bitter
enough
to
mimic
a
coffee
bitterness
instead
of
a
ris
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
and
thick
medium
body
with
a
low
to
medium
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
despite
this
being
more
of
a
sipper
alcohol
is
well
masked
with
some
warming
kicking
in
at
the
end
overall
this
is
very
much
like
an
alcoholic
hopped
and
carbonated
iced
coffee
if
you
like
coffee
youll
love
this
beer
but
if
you
dont
like
coffee
then
you
may
hate
it
excellent
example
and
excellent
from
a
snifter
give
me
this
over
a
coffee
porter
any
day
overall
this
is
a
coffee
lovers
dream
i
would
gladly
substitue
this
beer
for
coffee
along
with
desserts
i
bet
a
scoop
of
ice
cream
would
be
fabulous
in
this
one
i
like
this
a
lot
combining
two
favorite
beverages
does
work
drinkability
is
good
i
actually
liked
this
a
bit
more
out
of
the
bottle
than
on
draft
carbonation
at
least
has
settled
just
enough
to
make
it
decent
i
want
this
year
round
but
it
fits
best
in
the
cooler
seasons
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
i
would
prefer
to
drink
one
a
night
and
spread
out
the
enjoyment
make
room
for
another
bells
that
delivers
if
you
like
the
style
this
is
a
must
try
a
fairly
thick
stout
with
coffee
grounds
wake
up
and
smell
the
coffee
java
and
roast
including
burnt
ground
taste
ok
for
some
but
not
my
type
of
stout
marvellous
appearance
with
the
dark
head
creamy
yet
mouth
numbing
bitter
and
roasty
aftertaste
pours
deep
jet
black
color
with
a
small
deep
tan
head
that
falls
to
an
almost
complete
skin
over
top
of
the
brew
good
looking
stuff
the
aroma
hit
me
immediately
after
opening
the
bottle
lots
of
coffee
no
doubting
that
this
is
a
java
stout
there
is
a
really
nice
sweetness
in
there
too
very
much
chocolatey
but
dominated
with
coffee
it
almost
smells
like
a
mocha
shake
i
am
a
fan
flavor
is
all
coffee
upfront
a
little
mocha
creeps
in
after
swallowing
with
some
lighter
chocolate
notes
but
it
is
a
bit
one
dimensional
a
modest
bitter
comes
through
on
the
finish
thought
its
not
apparent
if
this
is
from
the
coffee
or
hopping
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
it
but
id
like
to
see
more
going
on
with
it
feel
is
chewy
thick
with
a
very
minimal
carbonation
not
too
thick
where
it
gets
in
the
way
of
the
brew
i
think
the
feel
really
compliments
the
brew
alcohol
is
not
apparent
on
this
brew
i
think
this
is
a
nice
brew
thought
id
like
to
see
the
coffee
a
bit
less
with
some
more
malty
character
coming
through
to
balance
bells
keeps
me
coming
back
mouthfeel
is
medium
just
right
this
brew
is
thick
enough
to
inspire
love
and
thin
enough
to
inspire
a
great
drinkability
this
is
a
very
worthy
pick
up
that
is
a
fine
breakfast
stout
very
nice
stout
rich
but
not
incredibly
heavy
quite
drinkable
dsimply
great
i
love
the
coffee
flavor
in
this
stout
think
i
will
have
a
few
more
wonder
if
it
will
keep
me
awake
tonight
perhaps
i
should
have
this
in
the
morning
instead
of
coffee
this
brew
pours
an
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
twoandahalffingers
in
height
creamy
and
dark
tan
in
color
this
brew
simply
looks
like
a
solid
stout
the
aroma
screams
of
java
while
the
beer
is
still
once
agitated
chocolate
bursts
through
java
diffinately
dominates
the
flavor
but
like
the
aroma
a
chocolaty
malty
backbone
makes
itself
very
present
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
little
more
carbonation
than
most
other
stouts
however
i
think
that
is
a
good
thing
as
it
doesnt
interfere
with
the
beers
flavor
and
makes
it
easier
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
fine
brew
it
doesnt
seem
to
complex
but
it
does
a
great
job
of
being
what
it
says
it
is
a
java
stout
all
in
all
a
coffee
lovers
dream
come
true
this
is
a
fantastic
example
of
a
coffee
stout
bells
has
a
reputation
for
a
reason
huge
concentrated
coffee
aroma
deep
black
with
a
head
that
remindmed
of
those
snake
firework
things
youd
set
on
fire
on
the
4th
that
just
raised
up
as
they
burned
this
head
just
flew
up
once
the
pour
was
finished
wow
this
actually
tastes
more
like
coffee
than
it
does
like
stout
huge
coffee
flavor
that
is
so
acidic
it
actually
burns
the
throat
ample
chocolate
and
minor
notes
of
roasted
barley
touch
of
cream
sweetness
in
the
finish
i
could
see
how
some
might
be
put
off
by
this
i
however
love
the
hell
out
of
it
i
believe
that
this
beer
will
be
much
more
impressive
with
a
year
of
bottle
age
under
its
belt
i
think
that
the
flavors
will
mellow
a
bit
and
this
beer
will
really
come
into
its
own
serving
suggestion
if
this
beer
has
been
in
your
fridge
for
a
while
leave
a
bottle
out
for
15
minutes
before
drinking
it
really
needs
a
higher
serving
temp
to
be
appreciated
that
being
said
this
is
a
disappointing
beer
for
me
the
worst
stout
i
have
had
from
bells
which
produces
great
stouts
pick
up
some
kalamazoostout
pours
nice
enough
black
and
thick
deep
brown
head
that
is
fleeting
aroma
is
also
great
rich
and
complex
coffee
grounds
dark
chocolate
great
coffee
beers
smell
like
fresh
espresso
this
is
a
bit
stale
though
alcohol
is
apparent
in
the
aroma
the
ale
is
quite
flat
this
is
typical
of
a
thick
stout
but
it
would
have
benefitted
from
more
c02
malty
sweet
and
less
dry
than
i
like
the
hops
are
also
on
the
light
side
generally
stale
tasting
and
lacking
somewhere
again
more
stale
grounds
than
fresh
espresso
on
the
positive
side
the
smoky
toasted
malts
are
nice
and
a
rich
fudge
flavor
emerges
as
it
warms
as
much
chocolate
malts
as
the
base
malt
would
allow
are
used
here
bravo
to
that
another
great
beer
from
bells
brewing
great
for
a
coffee
and
beer
lover
i
will
be
definitely
picking
some
more
of
this
up
keep
up
the
great
work
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
coffee
aroma
taste
in
this
java
stout
it
reminded
me
of
the
results
i
get
when
i
try
to
coldbrew
coffee
which
has
never
worked
out
well
its
strong
on
the
bitterness
and
short
on
the
roasty
fullness
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
if
you
have
access
to
the
bells
line
of
stouts
pick
a
different
one
yeah
buddy
this
one
ranks
up
there
with
the
likes
of
founders
oatmeal
stout
this
is
a
badass
brew
poured
out
to
a
dark
black
color
with
a
syrupy
like
delivery
into
the
glass
a
big
yummy
foam
head
quickly
developed
and
stood
strong
at
about
34
of
an
inch
aromas
of
cocoa
and
roasted
malt
mixed
perfectly
with
coffee
and
sweet
cream
nice
taste
was
superb
coffee
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
dominate
and
fill
the
palate
with
sweet
sweet
flavors
mouthfeel
is
very
good
thick
with
a
chewy
element
but
not
so
much
as
to
feel
like
its
sticky
or
too
dense
drinkability
is
good
i
could
hammer
this
down
in
no
time
flat
and
go
for
another
one
in
a
heart
beat
a
nice
dessert
treat
id
happily
drink
another
two
or
three
of
these
if
i
didnt
think
itd
keep
me
awake
all
night
enchanting
indeed
this
offering
from
bells
is
a
superb
combination
of
a
distinct
coffee
note
coupled
with
a
rich
dark
stout
the
initial
pour
was
very
smooth
and
did
not
churn
or
overhead
in
the
glass
the
head
was
chocolate
brown
and
hung
in
there
for
the
beer
though
much
thinner
toward
the
end
the
smell
was
a
rich
odor
of
dark
coffee
roasted
malts
and
a
slight
alcohol
nose
the
taste
was
initially
that
of
the
roasted
and
dark
malts
but
not
overly
sweet
the
coffee
flavor
then
came
through
and
was
very
pleasant
and
not
at
all
overpowering
the
alcohol
taste
was
noticeable
on
the
back
of
the
throat
and
a
nice
compliment
to
the
deep
complex
flavors
of
this
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
complex
but
well
planned
very
enjoyable
not
a
session
beer
but
well
worth
enjoying
any
time
taste
the
coffee
stand
out
right
away
followed
by
some
bitter
hops
and
a
little
chocolate
the
burned
coffee
doent
follow
through
quite
as
much
as
i
feared
it
would
in
the
taste
but
its
still
there
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
and
creamy
just
how
i
like
my
stouts
not
my
favorite
stout
but
still
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
damn
sam
had
one
of
these
last
night
at
mackenzies
with
fellow
bas
stubob
and
fantome
deep
dark
color
appears
almost
a
dirty
oil
color
in
glass
big
brown
head
looking
like
oil
sludge
again
big
coffee
and
roasted
malt
nose
this
beer
looks
thick
and
follows
through
on
that
promise
heavy
lacing
down
the
inside
of
the
glass
huge
coffee
taste
followed
by
huge
roasted
malt
taste
stout
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
an
extreme
stout
imo
however
and
deserves
to
be
tried
at
least
once
has
kind
of
a
syrupy
heavy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
glad
i
tried
it
though
not
sure
i
will
again
12
ounce
bottle
this
beer
pours
out
black
with
half
an
inch
of
tan
foam
the
aroma
is
mostly
coffee
but
also
nuts
oak
and
chocolate
roasted
chocolatey
flavor
with
lots
of
coffee
some
fruit
in
the
finish
tasty
hop
flavor
oatmeal
too
this
beer
has
an
inredible
variety
of
flavors
and
they
really
work
well
together
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
very
smooth
well
carbonated
alcohol
is
noticable
but
does
not
take
over
the
flavor
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
coffee
and
stout
is
certain
to
love
this
beer
edit
just
looked
up
this
batch
number
on
bells
website
and
realized
this
was
packaged
on
october
28
2004
at
almost
a
year
old
this
brew
is
still
amazing
i
will
have
to
try
one
fresh
and
then
get
some
more
to
cellar
i
love
it
when
beer
exceeds
my
expectations
poured
this
into
a
tulip
and
glad
i
did
as
it
greatly
enhances
the
appearance
a
deep
black
with
a
pillowy
soft
brown
head
upon
close
inspection
lots
of
tiny
cascading
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
to
the
top
of
this
keeping
the
small
lace
head
alive
as
now
the
large
initial
head
has
faded
nose
has
notes
of
toasted
bread
milk
chocolate
bakers
chocolate
and
of
course
coffee
warming
after
just
a
sip
the
alcohol
is
clearly
there
but
gives
a
nice
balance
to
the
rest
of
the
flavors
and
theres
a
lot
to
pick
out
aside
from
an
odd
astringent
plastic
flavor
which
is
mild
and
i
think
from
the
coffee
a
sweet
cream
and
solid
hop
bitterness
balances
the
darkness
of
the
chocolate
and
roastiness
of
the
coffee
making
this
a
pretty
nicely
flavorful
brew
nice
well
balanced
carbonation
helps
the
body
of
this
brew
however
the
fullbody
and
sweetness
of
it
make
it
a
little
tough
to
drink
definitely
a
brew
that
id
drink
one
at
a
time
per
week
maybe
very
tasty
with
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
could
enjoy
one
of
these
from
time
to
time
but
not
on
a
regular
basis
maybe
i
just
need
to
start
drinking
black
coffee
to
truly
appreciate
this
stout
i
am
a
coffee
lover
but
the
aftertaste
of
this
beer
kind
of
reminds
me
of
coffee
that
is
made
too
strong
and
cooked
on
a
burner
for
a
couple
hours
this
is
a
good
beer
and
would
love
to
try
on
draught
the
drinkability
suffers
a
litte
from
the
aftertaste
but
is
still
slightly
above
average
wow
i
love
this
beer
hey
who
put
a
pot
of
espresso
in
my
beer
glass
that
is
what
it
looks
like
tastes
like
and
smells
like
it
has
some
high
gravity
sweetness
and
body
but
the
espresso
flavors
and
ground
bean
texture
overpowers
it
all
i
dont
know
if
the
bittering
is
from
intense
flavor
hopping
or
from
grain
astringency
it
even
has
a
bitter
nose
that
is
more
reminescent
of
itallian
espresso
than
a
stout
yeast
nicely
earthy
and
nutty
nicely
alcoholic
something
to
cut
through
the
body
warming
and
intensely
flavored
into
the
finish
the
aftertaste
ligers
like
a
fine
cigar
full
velvet
like
mouthfeel
the
easy
drinkability
and
hidden
alcohol
makes
this
one
quite
drinkable
mmm
i
could
see
this
one
with
a
nice
chocolate
cake
however
if
i
had
the
opportunity
to
get
several
of
these
puppies
i
wouldnt
mind
making
a
nice
tira
misu
with
it
my
second
bells
after
their
porter
love
coffee
and
coffee
flavored
things
so
i
had
to
give
this
one
a
try
as
it
says
right
on
the
bottle
that
its
brewed
with
coffee
pours
jet
black
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
disappates
to
a
coating
that
lasts
til
the
final
drop
cloudy
with
what
appear
to
be
coffee
grounds
at
the
end
looks
great
smell
is
straight
up
coffee
surprised
good
roasted
coffee
too
not
burnt
coffee
which
is
nice
for
a
change
taste
follows
suit
thank
god
i
bet
this
would
even
be
good
heated
up
nice
and
sweet
but
not
cloying
with
enough
bitter
to
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
is
right
on
immaculately
smooth
with
good
carbonation
could
drink
this
for
days
even
in
the
morning
highly
recommended
for
any
other
coffee
heads
out
there
body
is
dark
as
night
maybe
a
hint
of
light
sneaking
thourgh
the
bottom
of
the
chalice
head
is
dark
tan
fairly
large
with
good
retention
a
whole
lot
of
coffee
in
the
nose
not
much
of
a
surprise
but
very
welcome
like
a
cup
of
fresh
brew
this
will
peobably
keep
me
up
to
3
in
the
morning
taste
is
brash
and
bold
a
huge
amount
of
coffee
in
the
flavor
alcohol
is
also
present
which
just
adds
to
the
spirit
of
this
brew
original
in
the
sheer
amount
and
interaction
of
the
huge
flavors
of
this
beer
excellent
and
challenging
seriously
the
flavor
of
this
brew
is
overthetop
way
more
flavorful
than
i
was
expecting
very
good
but
maybe
a
little
too
unbalanced
tastes
like
a
cup
of
lightly
sweetened
dark
roast
brew
mixed
with
spicy
hops
ends
with
a
bitter
you
guessed
it
coffeelike
finish
as
it
warms
its
reminiscent
of
chocolatecovered
espresso
beans
mouth
is
thick
and
syrupy
yet
spritzy
and
tingly
on
the
tongue
its
a
real
mouthful
practically
a
meal
in
itself
albeit
a
caffeinated
one
amazing
stuff
specially
for
the
coffee
freak
in
the
mouth
it
felt
quite
creamy
and
a
little
fizzy
overall
just
fine
the
coffee
flavor
dominated
the
taste
as
well
but
it
was
very
enjoyable
somewhat
bitter
as
well
coffee
lots
im
not
a
coffee
drinker
so
this
flavor
isnt
my
favorite
but
still
its
good
relatively
thick
and
a
rich
experience
so
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
at
once
full
bodied
almost
totally
black
and
opaque
with
a
thick
creamy
chestnut
colored
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
some
decent
lace
the
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malt
espresso
coffee
and
charred
wood
the
dark
roasted
malts
hit
you
right
up
front
with
just
a
touch
of
caramel
to
balnce
then
the
coffee
taste
comes
in
with
a
creamy
smooth
slightly
fruity
almost
cappacino
impact
with
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
finishes
dry
with
a
lingering
charred
wood
taste
with
a
little
more
of
the
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
background
i
had
to
check
the
bottle
to
make
sure
it
didnt
say
starbucks
a
beer
for
coffee
lovers
substantial
mouthfeel
almost
like
an
oatmeal
stout
but
still
very
drinkable
this
would
be
great
after
dinner
take
your
time
and
let
it
warm
up
a
little
it
just
gets
better
notes
drinkable
but
not
for
the
noncoffee
drinker
ive
had
this
one
when
it
was
colder
and
the
flavors
werent
as
noticeable
drink
this
one
after
its
had
a
chance
to
warm
up
from
the
fridge
if
you
would
like
the
full
coffee
flavors
pours
out
an
espresso
brown
with
a
smallish
tan
head
smell
is
decidedly
coffeelike
smell
is
unsurprisingly
of
roasted
coffee
beans
but
not
much
else
taste
is
smooth
roasted
coffee
all
over
the
place
not
a
lot
of
definition
otherwise
almost
no
hop
feel
but
overall
nice
and
creamy
if
you
like
coffee
youll
really
like
this
stuff
otherwise
id
stick
to
other
stouts
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
though
drinkability
while
thick
and
deliciously
complex
this
is
not
a
flavor
suited
for
session
drinking
it
is
also
not
immediately
accessible
and
it
took
a
while
for
me
to
aquire
a
taste
for
it
overall
a
fine
example
of
what
a
coffee
stout
should
be
modeled
after
bold
solid
and
hugely
flavorful
left
me
with
mucho
coffee

wonder
how
this
would
taste
accompanied
with
some

revisit
lots
of
fantastic
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
fridgecold
it
was
a
little
mintycitron
but
then
the
coffee
beans
really
rounded
out
and
complimented
the
moderate
easy
drinking
roasty
stout
underneath
delicious
scores
left
intact
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
the
flavor
is
mostly
coffee
and
some
fruity
esthers
from
fermentation
in
the
background
there
are
the
typical
stout
flavors
that
keep
this
from
being
too
off
the
wall
if
you
are
a
stout
or
a
coffee
fan
this
is
one
that
is
definately
worth
trying

please
my
only
criticism
id
the
thin
mouthfeel
if
this
beer
had
more
chewiness
to
it
i
would
have
given
it
5s
across
the
board
nice
coffee
stout
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
every
morning
a
big
thanks
go
out
to
feloniousmonk
for
this
choice
beer
overall
this
isnt
a
beer
id
buy
again
while
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
think
in
the
future
ill
stick
to
drinking
kalamazoo
expedition
and
third
coast
old
ale
if
i
want
a
bells
brew
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
as
well
undeniably
smooth
and
just
a
great
beer
this
brew
here
is
a
jet
black
concoction
brown
hues
in
the
light
dark
brown
head
sits
on
the
top
some
lace
the
scent
is
not
surprisingly
dominated
by
coffee
aroma
the
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
front
is
blown
away
by
a
rich
coffee
taste
hops
are
there
but
are
dominated
as
well
smooth
creamy
body
stouts
arent
my
favorite
and
i
normally
dont
like
coffee
but
this
beer
is
done
quite
right
especially
if
you
like
coffee
this
ones
worth
a
shot
final
thought
a
little
disappointed
as
high
expectations
were
shattered
however
this
beer
is
still
good
if
youre
just
into
dark
roast
coffee
and
chocolate
in
one
with
that
then
this
is
your
beer
if
you
dont
like
coffee
you
might
want
to
skip
this
if
you
do
like
coffee
embrace
it
mouthfeel
is
thick
silky
and
smooth
hard
to
make
the
call
whether
this
is
a
coffeeflavored
beer
or
a
beerflavored
iced
coffee
far
and
away
the
best
coffee
beer
ive
ever
tried
blessings
to
trbeer
for
feeding
both
my
addictions
pours
opaque
black
with
a
healthy
tanbrown
head
good
lacing
and
nice
head
retention
a
nice
strong
aroma
of
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
full
of
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
beans
with
a
hint
of
smoke
strong
roasted
malts
countered
with
black
coffee
bitterness
make
for
one
hell
of
a
big
beer
the
finish
is
dry
and
roasted
much
like
a
sip
of
black
coffee
the
huge
coffee
flavor
may
be
intimidating
for
some
as
a
black
coffee
lover
i
adore
this
stout
cheers
dark

no

mama
likes
wow
they
bells
brewers
definitely
put
some
coffee
in
here
dark
roasty
bitterness
right
up
front
like
carbonated
coffee
midpalate
reveals
the
familiar
kalamazoo
stout
base
earthy
peaty
roasty
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
quite
delicious
finish
is
sweetish
with
a
roasty
coffee
bitterness
fullbodied
and
chewy
with
more
carbonation
than
it
needs
another
great
bells
stout
maybe
i
should
drink
this
every
morning
drinkability
pretty
heavy
stuff
so
i
couldnt
see
drinking
a
ton
of
this
this
paired
nicely
with
my
wifes
fresh
baked
brownies
this
is
good
but
there
are
better
versions
out
there
smells
of
over
roasted
bitter
burt
coffee
i
dont
mean
that
in
a
bad
way
the
easiest
way
to
explain
the
taste
is
nicely
roasted
stout
mixed
with
a
shot
of
esspresso
a
bit
too
much
roasted
bitterness
perhaps
leaves
a
strong
aftertaste
so
drink
this
one
when
you
are
all
done
drinking
everything
else
this
is
one
to
keep
in
the
fridge
and
pull
one
out
every
now
and
again
not
super
drinkable
but
tastes
good
every
once
in
a
while
this
came
from
another
gift
bottle
thanks
zac
it
poured
a
deep
brown
to
black
with
little
head
or
lace
the
malty
sweet
aroma
is
accented
by
the
coffee
added
to
this
beer
the
coffee
accents
some
chocolate
malt
added
to
the
mixture
the
coffee
is
more
subtle
in
this
beer
than
in
others
of
this
style
ive
tried
it
still
dominates
the
taste
but
doesnt
mask
some
of
the
chocolate
and
other
flavors
that
come
from
the
malt
any
hops
are
completely
disguised
by
the
addition
of
the
coffee
it
has
that
same
silky
smooth
bells
mouth
feel
and
has
a
decent
drinakbility
this
is
a
fairly
stout
stout
and
the
alcohol
would
prevent
drinking
too
many
of
these
this
pours
out
the
expected
pitch
black
with
a
quick
forming
tall
dark
brown
head
the
head
stays
for
a
while
and
leaves
nice
chunks
of
lace
around
the
glass
as
soon
as
you
pop
the
cap
you
know
this
is
going
to
be
one
coffee
intense
brew
without
much
effort
you
can
smell
the
huge
amounts
of
coffee
that
went
into
this
aroma
is
chock
full
of
coffee
goodness
with
a
lighter
back
by
chocolate
malts
and
a
bit
of
roastiness
this
smells
like
liquid
coffee
beans
almost
flavor
starts
of
with
a
strong
bitter
coffee
followed
by
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
after
taste
is
a
bitter
lingering
coffee
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
quite
drinkable
to
if
you
like
the
taste
of
coffee
otherwise
the
huge
coffee
flavors
would
get
too
much
after
awhile
but
for
me
its
great
taste
is
a
little
simple
but
still
good
and
this
can
definitely
be
a
replacement
for
your
morning
cup
of
coffee
many
thanks
to
clvand0
for
this
one
thanks
to
pisskynights
and
feloniousmonk
for
each
sending
me
a
bottle
good
stuff

the
head

staying
power
sweat
beef
chocolate
of
course
lots
of
coffee
hit
youre
nose
from
several
feet
away
the
coffee
aroma
has
a
somewhat
odd
character
too
it
one
that
i
guess
is
typical
of
coffee
stouts
but
that
maybe
is
a
bit
more
sour
than
it
should
be
hard
to
pin
down
flavor
is
full
roasty
but
disappointingly
ununified
an
enjoyable
if
confusing
blend
of
the
darkest
malt
unfinished
coffee
the
coffee
character
has
the
flavor
of
beans
that
have
been
soaked
in
cool
water
for
a
week
rather
than
brewed
a
fascinating
flavor
but
one
that
sounds
better
in
theory
than
in
execution
better
than
the
one
i
had
when
i
bought
the
6
last
year
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
after
its
time
left
to
its
self
deep
opaque
brown
with
a
brown
head
in
the
light
the
edges
appear
a
nice
amber
good
solid
lacing
the
aroma
is
initially
chocolate
giving
way
to
roasted
malts
and
coffee
the
flavor
is
bitter
and
malty
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
this
is
a
great
stout
not
relying
too
heavily
on
the
coffee
for
character
it
has
some
body
and
a
slightly
astringent
aftertaste
i
enjoy
the
balance
here
it
makes
it
more
drinkable
poured

duh
coffee
flavor
coffe
chocolate
i
was
a
little
hesitant
about
buying
this
becausse
of
the
java
because
of
past
experiences
i
have
had
with
things
with
coffee
flavor
in
it
but
this
was
differant
the
flavor
of
the
coffee
ws
like
the
cuban
blend
that
i
like
to
drink
strong
bout
not
bitter
a
very
good
beer
pours
black
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
the
aroma
consists
of
dark
roasted
coffee
french
roast
and
expresso
combined
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
fruit
raspberry
syrup
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
the
front
features
dark
chocolate
expresso
and
roasted
malt
middle
sweetens
a
bit
almost
like
chocolate
frosting
the
finish
combines
flavors
of
burnt
malt
and
introduces
a
slight
bite
from
the
hop
bitterness
a
touch
grainy
too
java
stout
is
complex
and
robust
both
in
flavor
and
texture
this
is
a
filling
stout
and
although
delicious
one
all
by
itself
hits
the
spot
i
could
sip
on
this
one
for
a
long
while
thanks
to
brent
for
sharing
drinkability
didnt
particularly
care
for
this
but
if
i
see
it
on
tap
would
be
inclined
to
give
it
a
2nd
chance
this
is
a
nice
beer
bells
has
done
it
once
again
i
have
found
a
couple
of
bells
that
i
dont
like
but
this
one
is
nice
drinkablityoverall
unbalanced
yet
smooth
all
that
is
missing
is
the
caffeine
not
too
bad
but
its
not
something
id
stock
up
on
comments

one
good
bells
deserves
another
last
night
kalamazoo
this
night
java
stout
what
a
treat
a
treat
that
was
made
possible
by
feloniousmonk
so
i
have
to
give
him
props
for
this
killer
trade
i
lowered
the
drinkability
score
a
halfpoint
because
this
is
one
beer
that
you
dont
want
to
drink
much
of
its
good
but
a
little
goes
a
long
way
if
you
dont
like
coffee
move
along
otherwise
this
is
a
coffeebeer
geeks
wet
dream
and
a
very
intense
marriage
of
the
two
not
the
best
coffee
beer
that
ive
had
it
lacks
balance
and
is
a
bit
overdone
but
its
worth
a
try
for
adventurous
coffee
lover
thanks
to
crjmellor
for
the
bottles
this
one
is
pretty
rich
and
thick
it
is
full
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
it
is
a
bit
chewy
it
is
loaded
with
coffee
flavors
and
if
you
dont
like
a
big
roasty
burnt
beer
this
one
may
be
a
bit
much
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
balance
with
some
sweet
chocolate
or
some
dark
fruit
but
i
am
not
complaining
this
is
an
intense
beer
and
i
would
have
to
say
it
seems
to
be
at
the
level
of
4
or
5
shots
of
espresso
it
is
unique
and
it
still
remains
drinkable
i
will
search
for
this
one
again
the
color
of
this
beer
teeters
somewhere
between
dark
mahogany
brown
and
midnight
black
the
small
creamy
head
of
tan
foam
was
short
lived
wonderful
aroma
of
freshly
ground
and
roasted
coffee
cocoa
butter
and
even
a
touch
of
tart
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
is
rich
with
bittersweet
roasted
flavors
espresso
and
cocoa
blend
into
a
smooth
and
dark
stout
medium
bodied
with
a
roasted
bittersweet
finish
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
a
beer
and
coffee
blend
very
impressive
i
thoroughly
liked
this
beer
aside
from
the
smell
but
a
little
musty
tent
smell
is
a
small
price
to
pay
for
this
beer
pours
black
as
night
no
light
or
colored
hues
come
through
huge
billowing
tan
head
slowly
recedes
and
leave
excellent
lace
deep
roasted
aroma
coffee
and
grain
with
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
flavor
is
pretty
much
the
same
black
coffee
roasted
grain
dark
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
alcohol
stays
well
hidden
finishes
dry
with
a
nuttiness
full
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
highly
drinkable
considering
the
richness
of
flavor
and
higher
alcohol
content
goes
nice
with
breakfast
or
would
be
good
after
dinner
i
am
not
coffee
drinker
but
this
i
love
this
stout
pours
tar
black
with
a
thick
dark
tan
head
with
abundant
lacing
one
of
the
most
impressive
beers
i
have
ever
layed
eyes
on
the
aroma
is
almost
strictly
coffee
as
you
can
smell
it
twenty
feet
across
the
room
overpowering
to
say
the
least
there
is
a
hint
of
oreo
cookie
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
the
flavor
but
coffee
grounds
again
dominate
both
i
personally
think
the
flavor
is
better
than
the
aroma
but
is
still
too
much
like
stale
coffee
grounds
the
extremely
astrigent
harsh
coffee
taste
is
unpleasant
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
as
i
like
both
stouts
and
coffee
but
this
took
it
too
far
it
isnt
too
much
that
i
cant
finish
the
beer
but
it
sure
comes
close
to
that
threshold
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
creamy
this
coffee
stout
does
have
some
great
characteristics
but
the
coffee
is
taken
too
far
i
cant
drink
caffeine
as
it
gives
me
headaches
and
unfortunately
this
did
give
me
one
consequently
drinkability
is
way
down
for
me
a
definite
beer
to
try
for
stout
and
coffee
fans
and
i
am
glad
i
did
but
i
am
also
glad
i
only
bought
a
couple
of
bottles
a
very
solid
stout
with
a
pronounced
coffee
character
as
intended
with
the
use
of
fresh
roast
beans
well
done
hmmmm
maybe
ill
have
this
again
if
it
is
at
about
600
a
m
notes
a
solid
coffee
stout
with
just
enough
coffee
flavor
not
to
get
in
the
way
yet
add
something
special
to
the
palate
the
color
was
a
darkreddish
brown
with
a
beige
head
no
lacing
really
it
smells
exactly
like
starbucks
coffee
it
had
a
roasted
coffee
flavor
the
aftertaste
was
bitter
though
not
unlike
coffee
the
mouthfeel
was
sticky
and
heavy
this
beer
was
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
one
was
enough
for
me
had
this
beer
on
tap
on
a
rainy
april
afternoon
so
enjoyable
and
perfect
for
the
time
place
date
and
circumstance
a
william
trevoresque
beer
for
the
english
major
in
you
beautiful
dark
chocolate
color
nice
balance
of
malt
and
a
even
mouthfeel
made
this
a
silky
experience
descending
down
this
gullet
my
first
impression
of
taste
would
be
fudgecicle
in
a
glass
chocalate
essence
and
full
body
combined
with
a
creamy
head
made
this
an
exceptional
stout
it
may
be
on
my
list
of
stouts
that
can
hold
a
candle
to
my
absolute
favoritesam
smiths
doulbe
choccolate
stout
a
perrenial
winner
but
what
i
expect
from
larry
bell
and
kalamazoo
brewing
comapny
a
wonderful
libation
to
get
a
buzz
off
life
too

the
nose
and
i
swear
i
smelled
some
smoke
but
maybe
not
taste
is
all
about
the
coffee
and
works
well
the
alcohol
of
this
big
beer
is
well
hidden
by
the
coffee
and
which
makes
it
both
dangerously
drinkable
and
just
plain
dangerous
not
a
big
coffee
fan
normally
but
if
im
going
to
have
coffee
this
is
the
form
i
want
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
just
the
right
viscosity
stays
on
your
tounge
like
an
imperial
but
without
the
big
alcholhop
oomph
very
tasty
very
drinkable
ive
always
seen
people
say
that
a
stout
should
be
served
with
ice
cream
that
always
sounded
nasty
to
me
this
guy
would
actually
be
a
great
compliment
to
something
like
that
great
stuff

im
going
to
have
to
find
some

fingers
of
dark
tan
head
there
is
good
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
chock
full
of
burnt
malt
and
roasted
coffee
smells
just
like
a
quality
cup
of
joe
the
taste
has
lots
of
burnt
malt
up
front
and
a
black
coffee
bitterness
it
has
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
the
finish
contains
a
small
dose
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
super
smooth
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
a
coffee
lovers
dream
thanks
feloniousmonk
i
thought
id
seen
black
beers
before
i
was
wrong
this
baby
is
the
deepest
shade
of
black
one
might
imagine
espresso
black
topped
with
a
creamy
milk
chocolate
14
head
that
recedes
to
an
everpresent
topping
huge
aromas
of
brazillian
coffe
and
roasted
oats
it
really
smells
like
a
cup
of
coffee
i
cant
get
over
it
slight
chocolatey
undertones
carbonation
is
just
a
little
bit
on
the
high
side
still
quite
full
and
chewy
in
the
mouth
big
roasted
oats
and
waves
and
waves
of
mocha
coffe
flavors
light
blanacing
hops
in
the
end
with
a
touch
of
signature
bells
sourness
a
very
full
bodied
and
big
beer
but
still
somewhat
drinkable
one
hell
of
an
impressive
stout
this
one
will
stand
out
in
my
mind
for
quite
some
time
aroma
and
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
lots
of
coffee
nicely
bittered
dry
and
smooth
medium
to
heavy
body
a
different
and
well
crafted
brew
let
me
just
say
right
off
the
bat
that
i
love
coffee
and
espresso
and
i
love
beer
and
have
tried
the
hybrid
before
but
i
was
especially
looking
forward
to
trying
this
one
because
ive
enjoyed
everything
ive
tried
from
the
kalamazoo
brewery
poured
jet
black
with
a
thick
brown
head
at
55
degrees
obvious
notes
of
coffee
and
black
patent
malts
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
some
dark
chocolate
quite
enjoyable
but
the
coffee
portion
of
the
brew
tastes
a
bit
like
folgers
or
eight
oclock
rather
than
gevalia
or
even
starbucks
overall
quite
a
solid
hybrid
brew
drinkability
very
smooth
beer
but
i
probably
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
night
i
like
coffee
but
even
for
me
the
overwhelming
coffee
flavor
in
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
cant
knock
it
on
drinkability
however
cause
this
is
one
deliciously
drinkable
beer
gds
dark
brown
hue
dark
tan
head
sheets
of
lacing
noted
throughout
some
coffee
cocoa
roasted
malts
on
the
nose
sweet
roasted
malts
extremely
thick
perhaps
a
full
based
body
definitive
coffee
beans
espresso
notes
a
touch
carbonated
very
creamy
and
rich
texture
a
mild
bitterness
some
chocolate
should
be
noted
towards
the
finish
enjoyed
a
bit
better
when
warmed
to
room
temp
flavorful
and
unique
clearly
a
sipper
to
enjoy
its
rich
creamy
offerings
bells
has
yet
to
disappoint
once
again
they
go
outside
the
bottle
with
another
fine
dark
brew
drinkability
not
my
favorite
coffee
stout
too
much
coffee
bitterness
takes
away
some
enjoyment
but
oddly
enough
grows
on
me
over
time
give
this
one
a
try
when
you
can
intense
aromas
of
burnt
coffee
emanate
from
my
glass
there
is
a
bit
of
offputting
astringency
acidity
as
well
as
a
hint
of
chocolate
as
well
a
deep
dense
dark
brown
color
approaching
a
deep
black
color
fairly
low
carbonation
but
when
roused
the
beer
produces
a
thick
brow
dense
head
a
thick
creamy
body
this
beer
is
far
better
when
it
is
on
the
warm
side
when
it
is
cold
it
is
far
to
astringent
out
of
balance
when
allowed
to
warm
the
sharp
acrid
roast
coffee
notes
mellow
meld
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
has
a
strong
roast
component
as
well
as
a
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
taste
finishes
with
a
bit
of
sharp
acidity
perhaps
it
could
use
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
to
balance
the
roast
component
this
beer
just
seems
a
bit
out
of
balance
overall
a
great
big
stout
but
lacking
in
the
java
department
for
me
id
have
this
again
however
its
abv
and
flavor
mesh
perfectly
for
a
winter
beer
i
can
see
how
some
might
not
like
the
java
stout
but
i
found
it
quite
tasty
i
cant
drink
it
too
quickly
but
i
can
still
see
consuming
several
in
an
evening
i
wonder
is
there
actually
any
caffeine
in
this
pours
jet
black
with
a
small
creamy
tan
head
on
top
smell
is
mostly
pure
coffee
but
theres
a
hint
of
some
sort
of
creamy
smell
though
smells
great
taste
is
of
coffee
mainly
and
roasted
malts
but
the
coffee
flavor
dominates
the
roasty
stout
flavor
more
according
to
my
palate
anyway
this
stout
is
fairly
bitter
but
i
think
a
lot
is
due
to
the
coffee
the
finsish
is
kind
of
acidic
harsh
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
and
thick
very
nice
the
overall
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
this
beer
seems
to
be
inconsistent
or
maybe
my
palate
is
because
i
bought
a
case
of
this
and
ive
had
several
on
different
occasions
and
sometimes
its
an
amazing
coffee
stout
and
other
times
it
is
just
too
harsh
and
acidic
overall
id
definitely
give
it
a
try
to
see
what
you
think
more
than
any
other
bells
offering
id
label
this
one
an
acquired
taste
many
people
i
know
have
never
been
able
to
finish
a
bottle
of
it
as
the
taste
is
so
dominating
if
you
normally
like
espresso
youll
probably
like
it
others
are
urged
to
buy
a
bottle
before
a
6
pack
as
its
usually
either
a
home
run
or
a
complete
strike
out
in
my
experience
its
been
quite
sometime
since
i
reviewed
this
beer
much
to
long
im
afraid
the
beer
pours
a
piceous
color
with
the
head
a
chocolate
brown
crown
on
that
ebony
body
the
head
is
creamy
in
texture
and
the
lace
a
fine
curtain
to
drape
the
glass
deep
roasted
grain
coffee
sweet
malt
fresh
and
clean
to
the
senses
start
is
lightly
sweet
thickly
malted
with
the
top
full
in
its
feel
finish
is
masterfully
hopped
moderately
carbonate
and
the
toasted
grains
leave
a
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
dry
and
a
really
nice
stout
one
i
enjoy
and
wish
were
more
available
deep
dark
beer
with
reddish
highlights
dark
tan
head
completes
the
presentation
the
aroma
is
pretty
much
all
coffe
maybe
a
bit
of
hops
but
more
likely
just
some
extra
roasted
grains
but
the
smell
was
pleasing
the
taste
was
strong
on
espresso
flavors
with
a
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
almost
overpowering
in
its
assetive
coffeeness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
lighter
than
a
cup
of
cappuccino
drinkability
was
ok
but
this
is
not
a
favorite
a
little
more
chocolate
a
little
more
sweetness
and
this
would
be
good
as
it
is
its
coffee
for
drunks
or
those
of
us
that
may
want
an
excuse
to
drink
a
beer
with
breakfast
this
beer
poured
a
dark
color
with
a
small
tan
head
and
left
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
mostly
comprised
of
a
coffee
smell
nothing
much
else
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
totally
dominated
by
the
coffee
very
strong
blend
of
coffee
at
that
there
is
a
hint
of
a
roasted
malt
but
it
is
well
covered
by
the
strong
coffee
not
being
a
coffee
fan
i
found
this
beer
to
be
ok
it
is
a
well
made
beer
if
youre
a
coffee
fan
big
thanks
to
winomark
for
this
one
the
name
well
fits
this
beer
as
dose
the
label
as
soon
as
its
opened
the
aroma
of
coffee
bean
hits
you
on
the
nose
the
appearance
is
good
black
as
black
coffee
can
get
no
light
through
this
beer
the
pour
i
admit
was
impressive
its
a
thick
full
bodied
beer
so
the
dark
tan
head
bellows
up
slowly
and
cascades
as
it
grows
to
a
very
nice
frothy
top
lace
is
ringing
thick
and
stickyvery
cool
the
taste
is
at
first
almost
sour
but
soon
the
mouth
feels
a
smooth
mellow
dark
roasted
balance
of
malt
and
a
bitter
hop
the
mouth
is
left
tart
or
with
a
bean
bitter
aftertaste
the
mouth
is
dry
but
left
with
a
slight
oil
feel
a
dark
stout
busy
beer
alot
going
on
and
abit
much
for
its
not
an
easy
drinker
java
stout
feels
very
smooth
and
full
inside
the
mouth
i
must
admit
however
that
for
a
noncoffee
drinker
the
taste
is
a
bit
overpowering
im
glad
i
tried
one
but
its
too
roasty
and
javainfused
for
my
tastes
a
wonderful
stout
very
rich
well
built
and
the
taste
is
all
there
if
you
cant
stand
the
taste
of
coffee
howevery
you
would
want
to
steer
clear
of
this
one
but
otherwise
you
definately
should
try
this
one
out
like
most
any
stout
i
could
only
drink
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
there
is
just
so
much
to
them
if
you
havent
tried
this
out
yet
put
it
on
your
list
and
enjoy
this
stout
poured
a
nice
brownish
black
with
a
tan
head
all
i
could
smell
was
coffee
which
didnt
bother
me
one
bit
i
think
that
i
enjoyed
the
smell
more
than
tasting
the
it
the
tase
was
of
very
strong
coffee
just
as
i
had
expected
im
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
it
was
pretty
decent
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
coffee
i
love
stouts
and
porters
that
feature
coffee
flavors
i
like
coffee
i
like
most
of
bells
products
but
i
did
not
like
this
beer
poured
an
oily
inky
black
aroma
was
like
cold
used
coffee
grounds
flavor
was
that
of
a
pretty
good
dry
stout
with
a
5050
mix
of
extrastrong
columbian
coffee
unlike
maltderived
coffee
flavors
here
the
real
coffee
used
in
the
brewing
process
imparted
a
thin
harsh
cold
coffee
flavor
for
me
this
was
like
their
cherry
stout
a
beer
that
was
an
interesting
exercise
and
worth
having
tried
but
not
one
i
care
to
have
again
though
not
my
favorite
of
the
bells
stouts
this
coffee
taste
appeals
so
much
to
the
geek
in
me
personally
i
like
a
little
water
with
my
beans
and
the
jolt
of
caffiene
that
follows
im
just
surprised
that
im
not
feeling
that
jolt
now
still
a
decent
beer
and
certainly
will
look
forward
to
it
in
the
future
i
like
coffee
and
stout
so
this
is
a
match
in
heaven
super
dark
nearblack
body
and
a
mountainous
rocky
tan
head
silky
rich
body
perfect
equilibrium
between
beer
and
coffee
no
one
taste
seems
to
dominate
the
other
a
nice
roasted
malt
taste
marries
well
with
a
light
coffee
flavor
a
brief
bitterness
is
left
in
the
palate
along
with
the
java
presence
the
typical
bells
aftertaste
is
somewhat
masked
with
the
java
java
yup
blacker
than
black
your
arent
gonna
see
through
this
one
it
also
has
a
creamy
light
bronw
head
the
aroma
is
like
a
freshly
brewed
pot
of
coffee
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
roastiness
the
flavor
is
like
a
pot
of
black
coffee
with
a
burnt
coffee
flavor
upfront
a
bit
of
roastiness
in
the
middle
and
a
burnt
bitterness
in
the
oily
creamy
finish
this
is
definitely
the
coffee
drinkers
beer
i
would
love
to
have
a
pot
of
this
at
work
in
the
morning
a
fullbodied
drinkable
stout
i
love
it
a
tasty
beer
but
not
one
i
could
have
more
than
once
in
a
night
nevertheless
its
easy
to
see
the
talent
it
takes
to
brew
a
stout
with
coffee
this
well
this
beer
is
very
dark
black
with
a
thick
light
brown
head
the
smell
is
not
strong
but
chocolate
and
coffee
are
evident
the
taste
of
coffee
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
malt
is
well
balanced
with
the
malt
sweetness
and
warming
alcohol
there
is
some
slight
bitterness
but
it
isnt
a
hop
bitterness
it
must
be
from
the
coffee
chocolate
and
dark
malt
for
a
beer
this
dark
and
at
7
5
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
becoming
a
favorite
of
mine
is
the
price
served
on
tap
at
the
bw3
in
downtown
indianapolis
my
glass
of
bells
java
arrived
at
my
barstool
an
extremely
dark
brown
to
black
coor
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
topping
it
off
aroma
is
very
bold
coffee
and
chocolate
these
dominate
anythign
else
tastes
like
a
dark
roasted
coffee
at
first
then
blends
into
chocolate
and
becomes
quite
sweet
through
the
middle
to
the
finish
where
just
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
is
detectable
body
is
very
full
and
thick
and
its
quite
smooth
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
a
good
beer
to
finish
a
meal
with
or
even
drink
with
or
as
dessert
not
a
beer
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
in
one
session
but
definitely
worth
enjoying
a
pint
or
two
roasty
big
time
coffee
grounds
nose
dark
black
opeque
look
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
sticky
rich
off
white
slightly
tan
head
the
taste
is
dominated
by
coffee
if
you
are
not
a
coffee
fan
dont
even
try
it
if
you
are
man
enjoy
the
ride
it
a
coffee
lovers
dream
inital
flavors
of
bitter
coffee
and
this
then
mellows
into
a
slight
hazelnut
smoke
and
slight
hops
finish
on
the
tongue
the
mouth
is
smooth
but
seems
just
a
slight
bit
flat
on
the
tongue
its
drinkability
suffers
slightly
for
me
just
due
to
the
total
coffee
experience
it
is
very
good
i
just
could
not
imagine
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
session
appears
dark
brown
basically
black
without
being
too
technical
nice
full
thicket
of
tan
foaming
head
speckled
lacing
aroma
consists
of
fresh
grounded
coffee
beans
chocolate
and
nuts
brought
out
by
the
dark
roasts
tastes
like
a
strong
cup
o
joe
with
creamy
chocolate
additives
brought
on
by
the
combonation
of
dark
roasted
malts
used
here
coffee
flavor
dominates
here
so
good
i
could
serve
this
up
with
breakfast
and
not
feel
bad
about
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
very
cream
textured
drinkability
like
i
said
i
get
drink
it
for
breakfast
putting
coffee
in
a
stout
is
a
great
concept
especially
when
bells
is
doing
it
this
is
no
coffee
flavored
stout
this
is
one
wake
your
ass
up
and
get
moving
coffee
first
beer
second
in
my
mind
strong
coffee
smell
and
taste
which
is
awesome
nice
steady
carbonation
holds
the
flavors
together
so
well
definitely
roasted
with
some
nutty
chocolate
mixed
in
finishes
slightly
acidic
just
like
coffee
does
the
only
problem
is
that
i
couldnt
have
many
of
these
because
id
get
way
too
wired
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
offering
from
kalamazoo
brewing
they
put
two
of
my
favorite
drinks
together
in
one
for
me
and
i
cant
thank
them
enough
i
cant
wait
for
bells
to
finally
reach
socal
ng
drinkability
hell
yeah
i
felt
like
a
drunken
squirrel
a
whole
bottle
might
be
a
bit
hazardous
but
i
will
be
fighting
my
girlfriend
for
this
anyways
and
sharing
is
caring
thank
god
for
beertrading
a
big
java
cheers
to
feloniousmonk
for
a
fing
marvelous
beer
sir
the
flavor
is
nicely
bitter
but
bitter
coffee
nonetheless
the
taste
is
very
much
of
a
dark
chocolate
blended
coffee
this
is
a
very
impressive
taste
the
feel
is
quite
full
creamy
and
smooth
one
of
the
best
stout
mouthfeel
dimensions
ive
experienced
the
drinkability
is
limited
by
the
heavily
bitter
flavor
and
the
abv
poured
pitch
black
and
opaque
smells
strong
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
tasted
much
like
a
cold
strong
bitter
coffee
the
bitter
notes
came
from
the
taste
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
the
coffee
taste
is
obvious
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thinner
than
perfect
but
still
nice
and
heavy
the
drinkability
is
nice
and
easy
multiple
brews
can
be
had
and
for
an
extra
treat
enjoy
with
frozen
snack
size
snickers
excellent
this
stout
from
bells
pours
a
lovely
opaque
black
colour
with
an
espresso
head
the
aromas
are
all
coffee
heavy
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
booze
the
taste
is
a
yummy
blend
of
dark
coffee
flavors
and
roasted
malt
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
especially
for
a
stout
that
is
7
5
abv
wow
you
could
have
fooled
me
it
pours
a
deliciously
dark
glass
with
a
toasty
tan
head
the
aroma
is
basically
a
strong
coffee
aroma
with
some
chocolate
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
coffee
flavor
prevailing
over
all
chocolately
as
well
it
has
a
mild
bitterness
from
either
the
hops
or
coffee
creamy
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
it
has
a
rich
finish
i
liked
it
a
lot
dark
black
color
medium
head
aroma
is
wet
coffee
beans
a
full
bodied
stout
strong
coffee
flavor
dominates
over
everything
else
in
this
beer
there
are
some
roasted
malt
flavors
choclately
and
sweet
but
they
are
so
blown
away
by
the
coffee
its
like
drinking
a
stout
that
has
had
some
coffee
added
i
realize
that
thats
the
effect
they
were
going
for
but
it
doesnt
really
work
well
for
me
there
is
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
i
cant
tell
if
its
the
coffee
or
the
hops
despite
its
unbalances
its
very
smooth
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
vintage
2001
poured
a
pure
black
witha
fair
size
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
pure
coffee
like
an
espresso
taste
however
while
it
has
that
coffee
and
roasted
barley
flavor
it
is
watery
and
lacking
body
it
was
still
a
good
beer
maybe
some
additional
aging
will
help
wow
full
body
full
flavor
an
awesome
beer
i
would
like
to
thank
feloniousmonk
again
but
youre
wrong
about
the
nippy
bottles
i
want
all
12oz
of
this
big
boy
this
beer
poured
a
brown
head
with
smallmedium
bubbles
the
hue
of
this
beer
was
black
and
there
was
no
lacing
the
nose
was
coffee
and
it
had
a
strong
coffee
flavor
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
smooth
unfortunately
i
didnt
like
this
particular
stout
because
i
just
cant
acquire
a
taste
for
coffee
tasting
beers
even
though
this
particular
stout
didnt
have
as
strong
of
a
coffee
taste
as
i
have
recently
tried
but
at
least
i
tried
it
flavor
it
has
a
very
big
roasted
coffee
taste
a
very
dry
mouthfeel
this
brew
poured
a
very
dark
black
body
with
a
dark
brown
head
full
of
small
to
large
bubbles
it
had
a
very
strong
smell
of
coffee
in
this
one
as
i
eagerly
anticipate
my
first
taste
the
head
is
still
hanging
in
there
and
the
lacing
becomes
apparent
on
the
side
of
the
glass
as
i
raise
my
glass
for
my
first
taste
its
very
strong
coffee
tasted
as
i
expected
it
to
when
a
hint
of
oh
my
god
what
have
i
got
here
hit
my
tongue
its
after
bite
is
just
within
my
range
of
acceptance
it
is
pretty
smooth
for
a
coffee
beer
time
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
great
brew
as
i
watch
the
military
bomb
iraq
aroma
contains
a
nice
mix
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malt
quite
pleasing
black
with
red
borders
when
held
in
the
light
firm
tan
head
with
some
lacing
present
taste
matches
aroma
very
well
sweet
tones
with
some
fruitiness
finishes
dry
and
medium
long
maybe
a
little
thin
but
nicely
carbonated
i
e
not
excessive
best
java
stout
ive
had
better
complexity
than
most
nice
chocolate
undertones
and
not
too
rich
just
a
little
thin
after
being
blown
away
by
the
expedition
stout
i
was
hopeful
of
another
good
stout
looks
impressive
with
its
deep
brown
body
and
fluffy
tan
head
aroma
of
strong
coffee
reminded
me
of
coffee
ice
cream
crisp
and
slightly
effervescent
with
medium
fullness
flavor
tastes
like
that
time
when
i
accidently
drank
coffee
grounds
that
were
floating
in
my
cup
this
is
rather
unpleasant
in
my
opinion
like
stale
wet
coffee
grounds
i
may
not
even
finish
this
one
to
me
the
aroma
didnt
appear
to
be
right
lots
of
ashy
roasted
coffee
beans
and
oddly
some
rotting
vegetables
i
liked
the
first
part
of
the
aroma
i
mentioned
but
not
the
second
aspect
i
dunno
if
ot
was
a
bad
bottle
but
the
palate
didnt
suggest
it
was
palate
is
quite
smooth
roasty
and
ashy
decent
with
quite
pronounced
bitterness
interesting
and
innovative
but
i
dont
think
this
quite
worked
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
this
overall
i
think
this
would
be
one
i
would
have
around
just
for
the
few
occasions
i
think
one
would
would
hit
the
spot
thank
you
feloniousmonk
for
this
awesome
bottle
color
is
a
super
thick
black
with
a
large
inch
tall
tan
head
that
crumbled
down
super
slowly
leaving
a
puffy
diveted
landscape
for
a
top
that
stays
present
til
about
half
glass
which
then
stays
as
a
hazy
skim
and
smaller
bubbles
a
hefty
head
for
sure
leaves
lace
in
thickly
sticking
sheets
ahhh
the
smell
is
just
lovely
its
all
dried
espresso
coffee
very
roasted
and
very
dried
and
uniquely
so
reminds
me
of
true
espesso
thats
served
in
eastern
world
cafes
dry
and
roasted
somewhat
bittering
too
in
the
smell
taste
is
crazy
espresso
deeply
roasted
dryish
malt
tones
with
all
sorts
of
dry
roasted
bitterness
thats
very
easy
to
handle
finish
is
nice
and
levels
off
nicely
leaving
lingering
espresso
dryness
slight
hop
bitterness
and
light
deep
dark
chocolatey
tones
across
the
palate
its
partially
full
quite
rich
barring
heavyness
and
silky
smooth
and
packed
with
nice
espresso
flavors
that
are
a
bit
overpowering
at
first
if
your
not
ready
for
it
but
once
it
settles
in
its
fantastic
makes
for
a
great
dessert
beer
and
conversational
piece
to
share
with
friends
if
you
like
coffee
in
any
form
this
is
a
must
try
and
if
you
like
highly
flavored
stouts
this
is
a
big
must
try
wow
black
as
night
with
ruby
hues
thick
huge
rocky
two
inch
dark
tan
head
bottle
conditioned
with
lots
of
black
sediment
strong
espresso
and
black
malt
nose
some
dark
chocolate
and
vanilla
whiffs
just
awesome
the
flavor
profile
is
astounding
rich
espresso
bitter
black
malt
chocolate
and
caramel
hints
all
in
the
beginning
yeasty
middle
bits
of
belgian
malt
a
touch
of
tart
sweetness
and
a
long
coffee
liquer
finish
some
well
disguised
hop
juiciness
is
present
as
well
full
bodied
richly
smooth
and
almost
silky
sweet
for
a
profoundly
bitter
beer
all
the
desirable
characteristics
for
a
bitter
but
smooth
coffee
stout
meld
together
in
an
unbelievable
drinkability
a
great
brew
and
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
its
a
coffee
lovers
decadent
delight
a
scoop
of
ice
cream
would
be
perfect
for
this
stout
absolutely
amazing
i
love
coffee
and
i
love
beer
i
love
beer
that
tastes
like
coffee
but
this
tasted
like
a
beer
with
coffee
grounds
dumped
in
it
i
could
only
take
a
couple
of
sips
i
actually
thought
i
would
love
this
combination
but
as
much
as
i
love
strong
coffee
if
i
brewed
this
i
would
have
dumped
it
tasted
just
like
when
you
screw
up
and
get
grounds
in
your
coffee
and
make
it
far
too
strong
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
sending
this
bottle
yet
another
winning
stout
from
bells
dark
as
night
in
the
glass
with
next
to
no
head
aroma
is
that
of
very
deeply
roasted
malt
and
begs
you
to
take
another
sniff
the
roasted
malt
shines
through
in
the
taste
and
actually
nudges
the
hops
to
the
background
which
is
something
different
in
a
bells
stout
delicious
overall
a
very
nice
coffee
stout
a
stout
to
get
your
day
started
and
make
you
ask
where
the
eggs
and
bacon
are
i
only
wish
it
was
a
little
bolder
in
its
aroma
buzz
beer
has
nothing
on
this
stout
thank
you
feloniousmonk
for
send
this
most
wonderful
stout
to
maine
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
smells
like
coffee
and
tastes
like
coffee
too
if
i
could
start
my
day
with
this
stuff
i
would
be
a
happy
camper
strong
coffee
flavors
with
roasted
maltiness
backing
things
up
not
the
typical
bells
malt
though
i
was
kind
of
skeptical
about
this
beer
but
i
really
think
it
works
id
recommend
this
to
coffee
and
stout
lovers
alike
very
deep
brown
w
a
murky
crimson
hue
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
beige
dense
one
fingered
head
leaves
spotty
lace
freshly
ground
dark
roast
coffee
dominates
the
aroma
but
is
supported
by
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
dark
caramel
w
hints
of
nutty
and
mildly
buttery
malt
not
unlike
a
rich
coffee
ice
cream
shake
unique
and
enticing
aromawise
coffee
while
quite
assertive
in
flavor
melds
well
with
chocolate
malt
and
pronounced
dark
caramel
sweetness
when
combined
with
the
judicious
hop
bitterness
and
mild
butterscotch
diacetyl
an
impression
of
sweetened
mocha
and
cream
bathes
the
palate
full
bodied
with
an
agreeably
creamy
mouthfeel
subdued
hint
of
black
currant
like
fruitiness
emerges
late
finishes
with
a
lingering
balanced
mix
of
residual
sweetness
and
roasted
barley
bitterness
java
stout
is
a
delightful
flavorful
and
unique
brew
that
exhibits
well
integrated
coffee
character
i
should
have
saved
this
one
for
breakfast
a
hearty
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
the
bottle
massive
cocoa
puff
head
that
leaves
stratums
of
lace
like
some
sort
of
high
school
geology
project
colossal
nose
of
coffee
chocolate
and
dark
ripe
fruits
should
have
saved
this
one
for
breakfast
a
creamy
smooth
malt
spine
is
the
vehicle
for
this
tasty
roast
elixir
to
make
its
way
across
your
buds
posthaste
i
wish
more
of
bells
stouts
were
as
carbonated
well
done
and
probably
my
favorite
of
the
kzoo
stouts
another
unique
brew
from
kzoo
the
late
2004
batch
has
been
particularly
better
than
last
years
highly
recommended
i
could
probably
put
back
34
of
these
no
prob
1105
and
ive
found
that
this
is
utterly
sublime
when
consumed
at
room
temp
dont
get
it
anywhere
near
a
refridgerator
amazing
really
if
you
like
coffee
and
you
love
stout
damn
but
this
is
surely
your
idol
bow
down
before
it
and
beg
to
be
worthy
that
bit
about
the
nip
bottles
that
wasnt
me
talkin
that
was
only
my
concern
for
those
who
cant
hack
this
much
coffee
and
who
cares
about
them
not
me
cant
run
with
this
stay
away
if
you
must
its
the
ultimate
sweetness
for
me
though
another
pitch
black
baby
but
this
time
one
with
a
nice
head
the
other
november
stouts
have
been
a
bit
sluggish
in
this
department
what
starts
out
as
lacing
on
the
glass
ends
up
being
sheeting
and
was
a
little
more
difficult
than
usual
to
clean
even
left
my
lips
a
little
sticky
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
very
roasty
and
fairly
dry
the
coffee
in
the
beer
does
more
to
reinforce
and
complement
the
roasty
malt
than
to
actually
pop
in
the
flavor
a
black
chocolate
is
submissive
to
the
bitter
roast
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
gritty
the
sourness
present
in
a
lot
of
the
other
november
stouts
is
only
a
ghost
lurking
behind
the
other
flavors
this
is
probably
the
best
of
the
groups
offerings
but
it
would
have
benefitted
from
a
creamier
mouthfeel
with
or
without
the
grittiness
dark
black
color
creamy
tan
head
leaves
a
lace
in
my
glass
strong
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
veryvery
bitter
kind
of
like
chewing
on
coffee
beans
after
it
warms
gets
much
more
flavoful
the
most
bitter
coffee
stout
i
have
ever
had
and
i
like
it
to
say
this
stout
is
infused
with
coffee
would
be
an
understatement
it
pours
opaque
with
a
charged
up
brown
head
leaves
some
lace
down
the
glass
nose
is
dominated
by
roast
coffee
espresso
etc
the
taste
is
rather
roasty
as
well
with
a
little
malt
character
seeking
through
but
the
majority
of
the
taste
is
coffeebased
pretty
good
stuff
if
you
are
a
java
head
mouthfeel
is
solid
a
little
carbonated
but
smooth
alcoholwise
it
packs
a
punch
due
to
the
massive
implementation
of
coffee
in
this
stout
i
dont
know
how
much
of
it
i
could
drink
but
overall
its
a
solid
unique
brew
you
have
to
like
coffee
to
like
this
stout
i
dont
drink
coffee
but
i
do
like
a
hint
of
it
in
many
of
the
stouts
i
drink
and
enjoy
there
is
much
more
than
a
hint
here
though
dark
brown
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
pure
coffee
flavor
is
somewhat
bitter
but
not
to
the
point
where
it
becomes
hard
to
drink
finish
is
all
roasted
coffee
with
a
little
malt
i
couldnt
take
this
in
large
doses
this
is
my
second
bells
november
stout
ive
tried
and
cant
wait
to
get
to
the
third
gotta
love
a
brewer
with
the
guts
to
pull
this
off
this
beer
poured
as
black
as
the
night
and
formed
a
hug
foamy
cascading
style
head
that
speaks
of
a
lot
of
carbonation
present
circular
lace
just
hangs
on
the
glass
with
this
one
as
it
subsides
an
aroma
of
malt
and
burnt
coffee
a
flavor
of
malt
and
burnt
coffee
a
rather
light
body
for
a
stout
the
finish
had
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
it
my
fourth
of
the
november
stouts
line
nose
is
darkroasted
coffee
and
malt
with
an
appetizing
bitter
note
rich
and
oily
on
the
palate
but
with
a
firm
acidic
backbone
which
keeps
the
richness
in
check
good
bitterness
but
its
more
coffee
bitterness
than
hop
bitterness
very
nice
deep
opaque
black
with
an
impressive
light
brown
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
very
much
roasted
coffee
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
flavor
is
bitter
not
like
hops
bitterness
like
eating
spent
coffee
grinds
bitterness
in
a
very
good
way
its
also
balanced
by
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
very
thick
almost
oily
mouthfeel
with
a
very
smooth
finish
this
is
a
wonderful
stout
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
to
end
this
review
just
because
its
taking
time
away
from
enjoying
this
beer
cheers
nicely
done
a
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
beer
my
coffee
tasting
brain
is
confused
it
smells
equally
of
american
roast
tart
strong
coffee
colombian
and
euroroast
black
oily
beans
there
is
caramelized
fruit
there
too
and
a
certain
reggiano
cheesiness
hints
of
citrus
leaves
roasted
tomatoes
chocolate
cumin
and
black
tea
appear
as
well
but
without
question
this
is
at
least
half
coffee
i
give
larry
and
crew
high
marks
for
making
such
an
interesting
beer
it
is
completely
undrinkable
head
as
stiff
as
puff
pastry
nice
and
big
sweet
and
deep
aroma
opaque
black
color
bitter
oily
expresso
taste
upfront
almost
like
coffee
beans
themselves
malts
soften
taste
somewhat
just
a
mild
fade
in
flavor
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
sweet
smells
and
bitter
taste
work
well
on
a
deep
drink
nice
idea
and
an
interesting
take
on
a
bitter
stout
for
coffee
lovers
this
goes
beyond
a
typical
dry
stout
you
need
to
be
careful
pouring
this
one
its
pretty
charged
up
you
get
a
big
rocky
brown
head
very
evident
coffee
aroma
on
the
nose
opaque
color
burnt
malts
on
the
nose
also
the
coffee
taste
is
not
subtle
in
this
beer
it
meshes
so
nicely
in
this
brew
i
am
not
a
coffee
drinker
but
absolutely
love
this
beer
theres
a
bit
of
carbonation
in
this
one
besides
coffee
i
get
toffee
and
roasted
undertones
a
great
bitterness
present
from
coffee
and
roasted
malts
rather
than
hops
ive
had
coffee
stouts
from
new
glarus
lakefront
and
redhook
double
black
stout
while
those
are
all
very
good
this
one
is
in
a
class
by
itself
obviously
a
new
favorite
fantastic
nose
w
coffee
but
not
overpowering
it
draws
you
in
and
then
delivers
on
the
promise
well
rounded
for
a
brew
with
something

coffee
bean
flavor
definitely
a
different
taste
to
this
one
nice
specialty
stout
creamy
tasty
different
its
great
its
really
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
malty
bite
to
it
i
was
fairly
impressed
with
this
brew
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
guess
i
like
my
stouts
more
robust
with
a
bit
of
a
thicker
tastei
think
cream
stouts
might
just
not
be
my
thing
decent
smelling
stout
for
a
lighter
alcohol
content
the
flavor
is
pretty
intense
will
revisit
again
when
i
want
to
drink
more
than
just
one
stout
in
an
evening
a
very
average
craft
cream
stout
in
a
world
of
great
ones
it
was
just
ok
overall
good
but
underwhelming
nothing
stands
out
either
good
or
bad
its
not
going
to
replace
my
satin
solitude
any
time
soon
hard
to
think
of
another
beer
with
such
a
range
of
strengths
and
flaws
ill
finish
the
fourpack
i
bought
but
probably
will
not
repurchase
o
i
like
this
beer
its
got
coffee
roasted
malts
not
sweet
but
it
smells
and
taste
like
it
has
oats
my
only
complaint
is
that
there
is
little
to
no
carbonation
i
can
see
this
as
a
regular
in
my
fridge
not
my
favorite
cream
stout
not
as
creamy
as
i
was
hoping
and
probably
a
bit
strong
on
the
alcohol
taste
but
still
a
fine
beer
did
not
like
this
at
all
this
is
a
nice
fullbodied
creamy
stout
that
is
smooth
as
a
winters
night
is
long
it
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
unfortunately
doesnt
last
too
long
the
nose
is
all
malt
it
is
a
very
sweet
stout
but
not
overly
sweet
to
the
point
you
cant
swallow
it
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
burnt
aftertaste
that
provides
a
nice
balance
thanks
bells
ill
have
another
i
first
drank
a
bells
stout
on
tap
when
i
was
in
college
in
ann
arbor
in
1985
or
86
that
was
a
ridiculously
sweet
stout
time
flies
good
stout
creamy
mouthfeel
and
nice
taste
o
4
50
this
is
such
a
solid
all
around
beer
the
smell
was
inviting
and
the
taste
was
spot
on
for
the
style
really
good
flavor
throughout
this
is
the
best
stout
i
have
had
in
quite
a
while
the
roasted
malts
balanced
with
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
is
fantastic
overall
with
all
the
stouts
out
there
these
days
id
consider
this
one
decently
good
the
flavors
and
aromas
arent
very
robust
or
complex
and
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
its
tasty
nontheless
the
mouthfeel
is
where
this
beer
shines
as
the
name
implies
decent
stout
very
smooth
mouthfeel
muted
flavor
up
front
might
be
the
cream
but
finishes
with
some
roasted
malt
and
medium
espresso
a
little
bit
of
a
boozey
finish
maltier
and
smoother
than
the
kalamazoo
stout
with
a
milder
flavor
profile
but
still
a
hearty
roastiness
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
but
not
a
really
good
one
theres
some
good
roasty
flavors
balanced
with
some
sweetness
but
theres
something
missing
that
is
keeping
this
beer
from
being
great
unfortunately
i
dont
know
what
that
is
i
just
know
that
this
beer
is
missing
it
this
beer
was
pretty
meh
for
me
with
thousands
of
stouts
to
choose
from
these
days
it
might
be
easy
to
pass
this
one
over
slightly
less
oily
laced
brown
head
cold
hot
cocoa
its
a
thing
dusted
truffles
bittersweet
cocoa
and
very
smooth
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
love
bells
overall
delicious
and
easy
drinking
only
detraction
is
the
light
mouthfeel
that
is
incongruous
with
the
color
head
and
nose
this
jet
black
beauty
went
right
from
from
the
bottle
to
the
trusty
tulip
with
enough
of
an
aggressive
pour
to
produce
a
full
inch
of
mocha
head
right
to
the
brim
waiting
for
the
head
to
settle
allowed
the
stout
to
warm
a
bit
do
not
drink
this
ice
cold
the
warmer
it
gets
the
more
pronounced
the
burnt
chocolate
espresso
becomes
and
all
all
without
being
to
bitter
on
the
way
down
a
double
cream
mouthfeel
indeed
the
easiest
drinking
stout
i
can
remember
with
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
usually
i
like
a
stout
as
a
sipper
or
something
to
have
with
a
big
full
meal
this
one
is
refreshing
i
want
more
than
one
and
can
see
myself
going
through
a
couple
on
a
hot
summer
day
highly
recommended
medium
sweet
with
a
little
bitterness
very
good
easy
drinking

this
was
by
far
the
highlight
of
my
latest
visit
to
bells
i
sampled
it
on
the
paddle
initially
and
went
back
for
a
full
pint
on
the
nitro
pour
it
has
a
great
chocolate
brown
non

look
with
a
fabulously
thick
rich
creamy
head
with
a
mild
roastbold
taste
of
coffee
and
malt
that
made
for
a
smooth
creamy
finish
a
rich
malty
feel
with
a
nice
bite
of
grain
im
not
a
fan
of
stouts
but
this
one
was
very
enjoyable
overall
okay
but
not
all
that
special
a
bit
burnt
and
a
decent
amount
of
sweet
flavors
but
this
is
a
little
one
dimensional
and
not
all
that
interesting
besides
black
note
i
hate
to
say
that
i
havent
found
much
to
enjoy
in
bells
stout
beer
this
certainly
is
nothing
worth
writing

about

sometimes
deliver

this

drink
it

not

this
is
balanced
by
a
better

i
like
it
overall
this

a

comes
off
as

on

of
the

i
would
still
choose
left

nitro
milk
stout
over
this
but
then
this
isnt
really
a
milk
stout
its
a
cream
stout
i
dont
believe
they
use
the
lactose
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
its
good
worth
seeking
out
and
the
price
is
about
where
it
should
be

the

some

the
aroma
is
pretty
roasty
despite
the
taste
notes
with
hints
of
coffee
and
cocoa
the
taste
doesnt
have
much
burnt
malt
until
the
finish
with
some
upfront

of

the

there
is

a
very
creamy
sweet
milk
stout

by
abundant
roasted

this
mediumfull
bodied
stout
is
very
sessionable
great
example
of
the
style
odd
apparently
theres
no
lactose
in
thisit
tastes
just
like
any
milk
stout
should
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
ive
triednow
i
dont
know
what
to
think
this
is
a
really
great
double
cream
stout
with
no
dairy
o
underated
beer
imo
i
love
it
and
would
have
again
cheers
beautiful
no
see
through
ebony
color
aroma
is
of
sweet
milk
interesting
taste
is
smooth
malty
milky
goodness
well
balanced
and
awesome
in
taste
this
is
one
of
the
most
creamy
stouts
i
have
had
and
the
taste
is
awesome
and
the
aftertatste
is
mellow
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
burnet
sugar
nice
job
very
drinkable
in
multiples
love
it
overall
first
had
this
beer
last
winter
great
to
see
it
back
on
shelves
again
its
just
another
one
of
those
great
goto
stouts
for
the
colder
months
pretty
enjoyable
drier
than
i
usually
like
with
a
stout
but
one
of
the
better
cream
stouts
ive
had
chewy
with
an
extraordinarily
creamy
body
very
fine
carbonation
on
nitro
at
als
this
allowed
the
beer
to
a
creamier
softer
taste
as
compared
to
a
bottled
version
paired
well
with
a
chocolate
dessert
pours
black
with
a
creamy
brown
head
not
too
keen
on
the
smell
kind
of
boring
but
the
flavor
really
makes
up
for
it
nice
creamy
feel
at
first
toasty
chocolate
flavor
not
really
any
coffeeness
to
it
which
is
nice
i
like
this
one
o
a
solid
stout
from
bells
even
though
my
opinion
is
that
this
is
not
their
best
stout
nor
is
it
my
favorite
from
their
lineup
it
is
still
a
very
pleasant
offering
that
features
a
nice
depth
of
roasted
flavors
supremely
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
taste
is
great
very
smooth
rich
and
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
at
all
reminds
me
somewhat
of
st
peters
cream
stout
leaves
silky
after
taste
on
the
palate
simple
yet
delish
the
beer
is
rich
and
robust
and
does
not
hold
back
despite
its
abv
a
pleasant
surprise
from
bells
final
word
a
solid
drinkable
no
frills
stout
all
of
the
flavors
are
very
pleasant
and
balanced
but
nothing
here
really
surprises
or
innovates
this
is
the
kind
of
stout
you
can
rely
on
when
you
need
something
comfortable
and
drinkable
but
will
disappoint
if
you
are
looking
for
something
to
take
you
out
of
the
ordinary
this
is
a
double
edged
sword
as
there
is
definitely
something
to
be
said
for
really
nailing
a
rich
stout
but
it
lacks
that
special
something
that
could
make
it
a
favorite
or
make
it
stand
out
in
your
memory
grab
it
when
you
want
something
very
drinkable
and
smooth
or
when
you
want
to
make
a
meal
pairing
as
its
straightforward
profile
makes
it
perfect
for
that
purpose
cheers
an
absolutely
delicious
stout
but
i
dont
get
the
cream
part
there
s
no
sweet
finish
or
body
like
the
milk
sugar
usually
imparts
on
these
beers
but
other
than
that
curious
absence
for
its
name
its
a
wonderful
beer
rich
and
dark
huge
grain
bill
i
have
to
imagine
with
special
dark
carafa
and
burnt
barley
among
chocolate
and
caramel
too
it
all
combines
into
a
very
coffee
like
aroma
with
some
good
roast
to
it
no
acidity
and
an
intense
dark
chocolate
element
bakers
chocolate
unsweetened
even
super
dark
to
look
at
too
no
light
coming
in
and
not
much
head
on
it
but
some
khaki
froth
when
i
aggravate
it
the
flavor
is
not
overly
complex
just
the
dark
grains
meshing
together
all
the
way
through
the
thing
that
makes
this
beer
special
i
think
is
its
texture
its
rich
and
creamy
without
being
filling
sweet
or
too
strong
to
drink
a
bunch
of
not
as
bitter
in
the
finish
as
its
color
should
mandate
that
it
is
velvety
and
i
could
make
a
morning
of
these
for
sure
great
prenoon
beer
if
you
ask
me
thanks
to
clay
station
for
sharing
a
bottle
this
morning
looks
dark
and
beautiful
smells
delicious
mouthfeel
is
so
creamy
and
it
tastes
as
delicious
as
it
smells
i
know
its
seasonal
but
i
stash
a
few
to
enjoy
all
summer
long
the
roasted
malt
characteristics
stand
out
with
some
fleeting
hints
of
smoke
and
dark
fruit
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
earthiness
and
hop
bitterness
such
a
great
beer
i
cant
get
enough
of
it
this
is
a
great
beer
to
help
your
taste
buds
reset
after
a
couple
of
hop
bombs
also
a
perfect
choice
if
you
want
to
move
a
guiness
drinker
to
better
beers
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
good
stout
o
decent
stout
would
drink
again
o
i
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
this
stout
initially
because
there
are
so
many
flavors
and
sensations
going
on
but
id
say
its
good
maybe
a
bit
scatterbrained
as
far
as
its
approach
and
perhaps
unfocused
but
still
good
dessert
has
been
served
in
the
form
of
bells
special
double
cream
stout
this
is
one
that
id
love
to
try
again
o
very
easy
drinking
roasted
stout
a
little
more
body
would
help
out
still
very
good
had
this
last
night
at
the
bar
i
have
not
had
anything
from
bells
that
i
have
disliked
so
far
this
one
i
truly
appreciated
since
it
is
a
cream
stout
that
does
not
contain
dairy
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
delicious
chocolate
flavor
this
stout
is
pleasing
without
being
thick
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
recommend
it
highly
a
mellow
stout
with
a
velvet
sensation
good
not
exceptional
typical
dark
brownblack
pour
youd
expect
from
a
stout
a
small
creamy
tan
head
sank
to
a
ringlet
holding
there
and
dotting
the
glass
with
lace
dark
roasty

the
nose
milk

and
lightly
roasted
coffee
smooth
sugary
sweetness
in
the
taste
cocoa
light
roasty
bitterness
for
balance
and
a
slight
mineral
element
in
there
as
well
medium
body
slick
mouthfeel
but
perhaps
not
quite
as
luscious
as
the
name
would
imply
id
bet
this
would
be
great
on
nitro
but
i
say
that
about
many
stouts
nice
beer
overall
but
id
reach
for
an
expedition
much
quicker
than
this
deeply
roasty
but
lacks
maybe
a
bit
of
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
for
me
solid
stout
nonetheless
and
something
i
would
certainly
have
again
i
wonder
if
some
of
the
other
reviewers
had
a
serving
that
was
too
cold
because
this
is
one
of
the
most
flavorful
dark
beers
i
have
had
or
it
was
a
different
beer
it
did
seem
to
have
more
of
a
kick
than
the
double
cream
stouts
advertised
6
1
alcohols
its
not
overly
aggressive
not
very
bold
but
it
tastes
good
and
is
very
drinkable
o
one
of
my
favorite
bells
beers
very
sessionable
in
my
opinion
i
could
see
some
nervous
stout
wannabes
give
this
a
go
and
enjoy
it
worth
the
high
price
point
if
you
ask
me
very
nice
rich
yet
sweet
stout
smooth
enough
to
session
on
also
full
enough
to
enjoy
only
one
or
two
very
creamy
and
balanced
worth
seeking
out
but
wont
blow
you
away
o
this
is
one
rich
and
creamy
stout
it
has
great
balance
with
the
sweetness
of
the
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
bitter
hop
back
fits
like
peanut
butter
and
jelly
good
job
bells
overall
a
tasty
stout
another
solid
offering
from
bells
overall
a
little
disappointed
due
to
it
being
hyped
to
highly
by
someone
i
know
with
similar
beer
taste
as
me
good
but
not
great
still
quite
enjoyable
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
just
a
bit
thin
and
light
for
a
double
cream
stout
overall
for
price
point
this
one
is
a
bit
high
ive
had
better
and
far
worse
this
one
is
middle
of
the
road
for
me
i
wouldnt
buy
a
whole
pack
but
if
offered
to
me
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
jet
black
in
color
and
i
dont
see
any
light
getting
through
this
brew
i
see
a
wisp
of
light
brown
foam
on
the
top
of
this
beer
i
smell
rich
dark
maltroasted
barley
and
black
licorice
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
is
a
nice
contrast
to
the
bitterness
from
the
roasted
barley
that
fades
into
a
light
sweetness
at
the
back
of
the
palate
overall
i
am
not
disappointed
by
this
brew
great
take
on
the
style
i
would
like
a
little
more
from
this
one
though
if
this
had
the
fullness
of
their
kalamazoo
stout
then
we
would
be
in
serious
business
here
overall
a
very
good
stout
im
more
of
an
in
your
face
type
guy
when
it
comes
to
stouts
but
this
is
a
very
pleasant
mild
stout
that
i
could
have
a
good
day
grilling
in
the
cool
weather
with
my
first
foray
into
bells
isnt
a
bad
one
ill
be
checking
out
their
other
brews
soon
like
the
name
suggests
this
beers
main
selling
point
is
the
creamy
texture
and
mouthfeel
that
nicely
contrasts
with
the
roasted
flavors
that
come
from
the
malts
not
a
bad
beer
decent
body
appropriate
carbonation
level
stickyoilysmoothe
i
like
this
beer
and
its
perfect
for
a
snowy
night
in
the
teens
and
twenties
definitely
worth
picking
up
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
overall
definitely
a
good
brew
and
more
complex
than
some
other
stouts
that
i
have
had
however
i
was
quite
disappointed
that
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
beer
considering
bells
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
makes
my
favorite
ipa
and
my
favorite
wheat
beer
overall
a
good
but
not
great
milk
stout
bittersweet
chocolate
with
a
silky
mouthfeel
make
for
a
good
cold
weather
sipper
overall
3
5
in
the
grand
picture
this
is
a
really
good
beer
but
an
establishment
that
can
put
out
expedition

note
two
hearted

my
1
overall
beer
the
oracle
and
then
a
great
second
tier
java
oberon
oarsman
etc
this
beer
just
doesnt
hold
up
to
bells
usual
standards
imo
obviously
they
are
still
a
top
5
brewery
for
me
o
high
black
coffee
taste
with
very
little
chocolate
flavor
to
it
if
you
enjoy
black
coffee
this
would
be
a
beer
you
would
enjoy
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
stout
not
overly
creamy
which
is
what
i
was
expecting
nice
head
on
the
pour
with
a
deep
dark
appearance
it
has
a
great
smell
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
mouth
feel
is
fantastic
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
that
ill
try
again
without
hesitation
it
also
paths
the
way
to
try
other
beers
produce
by
bell
brewery
overall
this
is
my
dads
favorite
beer
but
i
can
not
say
that
myself
with
that
said
this
beer
is
excellent
an
excellent
choice
for
all
stout
lovers
another
solid
beer
from
bells
very
dark
and
creamy
i
love
a
creamy
stout
with
average
head
and
dark
color
too
bad
i
couldnt
find
this
in
six
pack
at
the
place
i
work
at
gays
hopsnschnapps
auburn
indiana
this
is
a
stout
i
could
drink
day
after
day
after
day
as
creamy
and
addicting
the
flavor
is
so
smooth
this
thing
was
all
over
the
place
for
me
the
aroma
was
excellent
but
unfortunately
the
taste
did
not
follow
the
nose
the
mouth
feel
was
thin
and
not
at
all
what
i
would
expect
from
a
stout
and
particularly
a
cream
stout
this
beer
had
some
potential
but
honestly
i
was
disappointed
especially
after
smelling
it
this
is
a
great
stout
my
favorite
stout
is
still
the
milk
stout
nitro
by
left
hand
brewing
company
but
this
is
still
very
good
it
is
very
smooth
with
a
great
burnt
coffee
finish
the
smell
is
great
very
malty
with
vanilla
and
coffee
and
hints
of
chocolate
i
like
the
texture
but
i
love
stouts
stouts
are
my
favorite
type
of
beer
and
i
feel
that
they
should
have
a
creamy
texture
this
beer
could
be
a
bit
more
creamy
its
a
bit
watery
like
guinness
but
not
too
bad
im
a
stout
man
so
i
could
easily
session
this
beer
but
for
someone
who
doesnt
drink
stouts
this
is
not
a
session
beer
i
feel
that
i
would
drink
this
after
a
steak
dinner
or
with
a
hamburger
great
stout
better
than
the
reviews
on
here
had
me
thinking
it
would
taste
overall
this
was
pretty
good
nicely
balanced
and
flavorful
i
may
buy
from
time
to
time
mouthfeel
slightly
carbonated
and
hoppy
coffee
malty
like
after
taste
best
served
really
cold
perfect
beer
for
these
cold
nights
bittersweet
fullbodied
stout
interesting
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
has
a
great
mouthfeel
if
it
wasnt
as
bitter
or
charred
up
this
beer
would
do
better
in
my
estimation
worth
trying
at
least
once
o
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
with
this
beer
considering
that
i
like
batch
1
750ml
black
note
more
than
batch
2
and
the
12ozers
price
point
2
2512
oz
single
overall
a
good
take
on
the
style
a
nice
change
up
to
most
of
the
stouts
im
use
to
drinking
worth
a
try
but
its
not
mindblowing
perhaps
in
the
future
if
it
is
on
tap
ill
try
a
sample
to
see
if
it
still
is
the
same
but
this
experience
left
me
wanting
more
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
mahogany
highlighted
blackishbrown
coloring
with
a
creamy
fluffy
smooth
tall
light
tan
head
that
slowly
settles
into
a
filmy
surface
coat
leaving
an
impressive
lacing
along
the
glass
aromas
of
cream
first
and
foremost
with
a
subtle
bittersweet
mocha
character
in
the
backbone
hints
of
vanilla
and
smoke
as
well
flavors
are
cream
forward
with
a
rich
and
sweet
blend
cut
through
with
the
bitterness
of
dark
roast
coffee
hints
of
bakers
chocolate
and
highlights
of
smoke
very
short
lived
sweetness
but
it
flashes
back
just
as
strong
with
every
sip
only
to
be
the
trojan
horse
for
the
bittersweet
and
smoky
blend
on
the
palate
solid
and
balanced
dry
light
bodied
despite
the
robust
flavors
but
the
beer
is
able
to
maintain
a
smooth
feeling
throughout
the
bitter
lingers
through
to
the
aftertaste
with
a
coffee
theme
but
there
are
also
lingering
hints
of
the
creamy
sweetness
that
started
it
all
slick
transition
into
a
dry
finish
with
a
bittersweet
linger
very
easy
to
drink
both
in
body
and
abv
and
very
flavorful
solid
beer
mouthfeel

a
creamy

all
around
good
balance

robustness
of
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
nice
stout
without
trying
to
be
too
over
the
top
not
overly
alcoholic
with
great
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
o
good
cream
stout
full
bodied
simple
yet
timeless
mix
of
flavors
its
easy
to
go
overboard
trying
to
be
unique
this
is
just
a
damn
good
beer
by
bells
thats
all
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
definitely
worth
a
taste
smoother
than
their
kalamazoo
stout
variant
medium
bodied
with
a
good
balance
of
roast
and
hops
the
finish
is
quite
clean
with
a
pleasant
roasthop
lingering
aftertaste
if
you
like
tame
stouts
this
one
fits
the
bill
if
you
wish
to
experience
the
best
then
founders
breakfast
stout
is
my
choice
o
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
sweet
milk
stout
by
the
name
but
even
so
a
solid
stout
from
a
place
known
for
great
stouts
i
think
i
will
do
a
5050
mix
with
expedition
and
get
a
taste
of
a
nonba
black
note
o
smell
is
very
relaxed
and
the
taste
follows
suit
good
balance
with
nothing
being
overly
complex
decent
beer
worth
trying
like
most
of
the
bells
line
up
overall
4
good
beer
one
of
the
better
bells
beers
poured
into
a
16
oz
tulip
way
passed
its
prime
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lace
smell
is
chocolate
biscuit
vanilla
and
smoke
taste
is
all
of
that
but
not
as
nice
body
is
thin
to
medium
enough
carbonation
a
little
dry
and
strong
drinkability
this
is
o
k
but
it
is
several
months
past
its
prime
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
flavoring
the
aroma
begins
things
nicely
giving
smoothness
heartiness
and
functional
sourness
much
like
an
english
porter
as
we
move
to
the
taste
however
we
get
a
beautiful
blend
of
rich
and
roasty
malts
sweetness
evenness
cleanliness
and
inclusive
darkness
the
feel
too
is
gloriously
soft
and
smooth
glugging
back
with
ease
and
providing
the
drinker
with
pleasing
closure
at
the
end
of
each
sip
this
is
an
excellent
beer
with
robust
and
devilish
flavoring
and
something
we
will
now
look
forward
to
each
winter
a
really
smooth
and
easy
drinking
cream
stout
editing
my
review
after
having
this
again
changing
the
smell
from
a
3
5
to
a
3
75
the
taste
from
3
5
to
a
4
0
the
mouthfeel

a
4
0
to
a
4
25
and
overall
from
a
3
5
to
a
4
0
i
definitely
like
this
beer
more
than
when
i
initially
reviewed
it
its
an
amazingly
drinkable
american
stout
and
tastes
and
smells
better
than
i
remember
or
my
review
previously
said
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
awesome
thick
but
nothin
too
crazy
has
an
overall
creamy
rich
feel
to
it
carbonation
is
there
but
not
overdone
this
is
a
great
s
beer
you
will
have
a
hard
time
finding
an
american
stout
better
then
this
unless
you
go
to
the
brewery
and
grab
the
nitro
version
o
a
very
good
stout
here
i
think
bells
does
a
nice
job
here
enjoy
cheers
o
not
my
favorite
stout
not
my
favorite
bells
beer
but
overall
a
solid
beer
enjoyable
to
drink
first
beer
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
from
the
guys
at
bells
poured
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
beer
came
out
jet
black
but
ran
smooth
down
the
glass
not
overly
viscous
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
very
little
head
that
emerged
smell
strong
roasted
malt
and
slightly
sweet
not
much
else
yet
i
let
the
beer
sit
for
about
five
minutes
and
some
notes
of
coffee
began
to
emerge
first
sip
very
smooth
roasted
malt
obviously
comes
through
the
coffee
i
smelt
earlier
makes
a
strong
entrance
without
overpowering
second
sip
begins
to
reveal
subtle
flavor
of
burnt
sugar
and
the
creaminess
of
the
beer
becomes
more
noticeble
with
a
name
like
double
cream
stout
i
honestly
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
of
what
to
compare
it
to
but
great
beer
overall
overall
youre
not
getting
any
surprises
with
this
beer
it
hits
all
the
notes
youd
expect
a
double
cream
stout
to
hit
when
its
all
said
and
done
though
the
cream
sweetness
is
just
a
tad
too
much
for
me
to
call
this
beer
great
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
2
of
these
before
id
have
to
throw
in
the
towel
hard
to
believe
this
is
dairy
free
which
amazes
me
peace
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
mediumlow
carbonation
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
not
particularly
good
for
this
style
certainly
smooth
and
creamy
but
apparently
at
the
expense
of
richness
and
fullness
closes
dry
with
little
residual
stickiness
across
the
palate
liquid
cocoa
pebbles
cereal
o
as
of
right
now
this
is
considered
an
exceptional
beer
i
think
its
a
good
stout
not
a
session
stout
because
of
its
complex
flavors
but
probably
something
id
buy
again
just
to
pick
up
on
the
different
flavors
extremely
easy
to
drink
lots
of
good
flavor
and
only
moderate
alcohol
all
bitterness
is
kept
in
check
so
you
dont
have
to
sip
you
can
chug
it
sad
ive
only
got
a
six
pack
overall
an
ok
beer
while
it
was
fun
to
try
i
would
prefer
more
depth
and
creaminess
in
a
double
cream
stout
i
did
appreciate
some
of
the
roasted
subtleties
here
but
i
doubt
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
overallthis
beer
is
kind
of
a
mixed
bag
for
me
while
i
love
the
flavor
everything
else
kinda
falls
flat
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
regularly
but
it
is
a
nice
detour
from
other
stouts
on
a
side
note
i
would
love
to
know
the
ratio
bells
mixes
this
with
expedition
stout
for
aging
in
barrels
to
make
black
note
3
75
overall
a
nice
stout
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
creamy
or
sweet
characteristic
but
the
stout
itself
was
tasty
overall
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
not
an
exceptional
example
of
this
type
of
stout
either
creamy
mouthfeel
was
not
as
creamy
as
double
cream
would
suggest
but
creamy
none
the
less
i
wish
i
wouldve
been
able
to
try
this
one
fresher
as
it
was
a
month
from
bells
suggested
shelf
life
but
i
will
give
it
another
shot
fresh
next
year
o
this
is
a
deadly
stout
that
is
very
highly
drinkable
oh
boy
if
this
was
available
in
my
area
i
would
have
a
new
go
to
for
the
style
rich
flavors
aromas
superbly
smooth
and
full
without
being
overbearing
on
the
palate
or
stomach
i
give
this
one
very
high
marks
and
highly
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
who
appreciates
a
super
high
quality
stout
i
was
very
excited
to
try
the
double
cream
stout
from
bells
that
excitement
unfortunately
faded
on
my
first
sip
it
pours
nicely
and
looks
great
but
the
first
smell
was
a
bit
burnt
to
me
and
it
didnt
lend
itself
well
to
the
taste
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
bit
more
burnt
and
bitter
than
i
would
expect
from
a
cream
stout
i
was
truly
disappointed
in
it
i
had
extra
bottles
left
over
from
the
sixer
i
bought
so
i
offered
some
friends
a
try
and
got
the
same
response
from
them
unfortunately
this
is
not
one
of
the
beers
that
will
be
gracing
my
home
any
time
soon
two
words
satisfying
sampler
i
think
the
name
might
lend
some
suggestion
to
the
flavor
and
it
probably
doesnt
have
a
sweet
cream
flavor
i
can
definitely
taste
it
though
so
maybe
im
just
an
idiot
o
its
tasty
though
not
as
complicated
as
the
bottle
description
would
suggest
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
dont
expect
to
be
blown
away
update
mine
was
bottled
a
little
under
4
months
ago

should
be
well
within
drinkable
time
barring
improper
storage
overall
definitely
a
great
stout
i
would
gladly
try
this
again
o
very
impressed
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
stouts
as
i
feel
they
tend
to
be
very
heavy
on
the
roasted
malts
this
one
gets
it
just
right
for
me
very
glad
i
tried
this
o
this
beer
was
only
hamstrung
by
how
tart
and
astringent
it
became
as
it
got
warmer

im

this
would

o
maybe
im
just
spoiled
by
all
the
super
flavorful
stouts
out
there
but
this
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
not
bad
but
not
one
id
buy
again
overall
another
winner
from
bells
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
flavours
and
it
tastes
like
it
was
made
with
quality
ingredients
not
my
favourite
style
of
beer
but
something
im
glad
i
tried
this
was
a
very
tasty
stout
i
wish
i
was
able
to
drink
more
of
this
one
i
just
the
rich
aromas
and
dark
compexity
of
bells
double
cream
stoutit
smooth
creamy
and
sweet
taste
give
this
stout
a
a
in
my
bookthe
over
all
essence
of
the
tones
blend
well
with
it
as
it
is
roastedthe
malts
that
are
used
play
a
key
role
in
finishing
this
wonderful
stout
on
the
palate
soft
o
great
beer
and
tastes
like
the
name
very
creamy
and
just
enough
sweetness
overall
quite
a
tasty
brew
its
a
not
too
overly
sweet
and
fairly
roasty
cream
stout
well
worth
a
try
o
this
is
a
good
stout
the
aroma
and
flavor
arent
quite
as
robust
as
they
could
be
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
short
of
the
wonderful
velvety
feel
that
great
stouts
have
but
this
is
still
a
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
with
all
the
elements
that
it
should
have
its
not
a
big
stout
but
no
one
ever
said
it
should
be
nice
beer
from
bells
tastefeel
up
front
you
get
that
extremely
creamy
texture
which
is
awesome
smooth
all
the
way
through
the
taste
is
somewhat
burnt
which
turns
me
off
a
good
bit
but
the
bitterness
isnt
too
extreme
and
the
super
roasty
malt
flavors
make
it
pretty
drinkable
overall
somewhat
disappointed
with
this
the
smell
was
promising
but
the
taste
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
its
just
sort
of
bland
still
its
easy
drinking
o
very
drinkable
with
a
pleasant
chocolate
linger
on
the
back
end
my
wife
hates
beer
specifically
stouts
and
she
actually
didnt
make
her
usually
disgusted
face
when
she
tried
this
the
underlying
roasted
character
gives
it
more
drinkability
and
would
be
a
good
option
for
ose
who
dont
quite
have
the
palate
for
super
roasted
and
smoky
stouts
o
bells
does
make
great
beer
and
this
no
exception
make
a
winter
choice
for
sure
and
share
it
with
friends
overall
an
amazing
stout
for
only
being
6
there
is
a
ton
of
flavor
packed
into
a
small
package
in
addition
to
excellent
body
a
great
winter
beer
o
a
toast
to
the
roast
of
this
incredibly
rich
yet
wellbalanced
and
supremely
flavorful
american
stout
at
6
1
abv
it
would
make
for
a
nice
afterdinner
drink
before
or
with
rich
vanilla
custard
or
chocolate
torte
topped
with
raspberries
its
malts
varieties
play
so
well
off
one
another
only
adding
roasted
bitterness
to
the
artfully
used
hops
o
a
really
solid
stout
and
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
a
coffee
stout
with
actually
having
coffee
added
big
aromas
and
flavors
in
a
relatively
small
abv
package
really
enjoyed
it
and
will
buy
again
rich
smooth
and
creamy
drinkable
damn
you
bells
for
knowing
how
to
make
me
want
to
drink
things
i
cant
get
oa
good
drinkable
stout
defiantly
going
to
enjoy
this
6pack
very
good
stout
that
probably
developed
the
sherry
quality
due
to
age
think
id
rather
it
not
be
there
not
a
bad
stout
it
would
be
great
if
not
for
the
metallic
and
acidic
finish
i
will
probably
try
this
a
few
more
times
because
i
have
had
wildly
different
experiences
with
different
stout
batches
from
bells
overall
a
fine
beer
very
smooth
and
tasty
o
good
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
just
a
little
too
hoppy
in
the
smell
and
taste
for
me
o
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
stout
not
complex
by
any
means
but
the
overall
flavor
is
nice
i
only
wish
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
so
thin
i
still
believe
that
x2
stout
is
a
superior
cream
stout
but
this
is
fine
o
this
is
a
solid
stout
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
it
does
not
have
any
surprises
or
variations
or
twists
on
the
style
it
is
simply
a
very
good
stout
that
stays
true
to
the
style
and
is
very
well
crafted
of
all
bells
stouts
this
was
always
my
least
favorite
but
i
remember
liking
it
alot
more
besides
the
mouthfeel
its
not
too
memorable
maybe
its
not
bells
best
work
but
its
still
a
well
crafted
beer
had
this
beer
a
long
time
ago
and
was
blown
away
this
time
around
it
didnt
impress
quite
as
much
but
its
still
an
excellent
beer
definitely
one
to
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
bells
192nd
overall
superb
american
stout
very
delicious
final
thoughts
ive
been
anticipating
this
beers
seasonal
release
but
without
incredibly
high
expectations
in
the
end
it
has
left
me
satisfied
with
making
the
purchase
of
a
sixer
would
i
drink
it
again
yep
given
the
season
and
limited
availability
ill
be
sure
to
ration
them
throughout
the
long
winter
and
probably
buy
it
again
next
year
overall
really
great
winter
beer
fantastic
mouthfeel
nice
fullbodied
and
rich
sweetness
all
packed
into
fairly
low
abv
b
personal
rate
3
5
mouthfeel
rich
and
creamy
there
is
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
astringency
keeping
me
from
giving
this
a
4
5
but
its
pretty
awesome
still
o
this
is
a
good
stout
but
the
nose
is
mild
and
nothing
about
the
taste
sticks
out
to
me
above
average
but
not
exceptional
o
overall
this
was
a
good
stout
though
not
as
good
as
i
expected
i
would
have
again
overall
very
enjoyable
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
very
solid
stout
maltyroasty
aroma
you
definitely
get
the
roasted
barley
thick
mouthfeel
and
very
roasty
excellent
on
a
cold
rainy
fall
day
this
is
a
winter
seasonal
beer
and
should
be
enjoyed
seasonally
overall
another
solid
offering
form
bells
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
complex
milk
stout
the
roasted
malts
are
intense
and
the
coffee
flavors
add
a
nice
balanced
bitterness
theres
a
nice
creaminess
and
some
toffee
notes
throughout
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
im
not
sure
i
would
be
able
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
once
but
i
will
definitely
be
having
it
again
very
nice
stout
with
some
potency
a
great
novemberdecember
beer
a
bells
beer
i
always
indulge
in
o
very
very
good
stuff
the
depth
and
complexity
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
at
this
abv
are
impressive
solid
overall
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
fits
perfect
with
the
season
nothing
better
than
a
stout
when
it
is
cold
outside
o
for
an
out
of
the
bottle
cream
stout
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
on
nitrotap
i
think
this
beer
would
be
a
knock
out
i
would
have
also
liked
a
little
more
decisiveness
in
the
flavor
either
more
chocolate
or
more
cream
since
its
a
cream
stout
more
cream
would
be
great
d
good
beer
i
think
it
could
be
a
little
more
rich
however
i
recommend
it
d
good
as
a
standalone
beer
as
every
sip
is
eagerly
anticipated
but
one
12
oz
serving
seems
to
adequately
satisfy
my
desire
for
a
full
bodied
double
cream
stout
at
the
end
of
an
evening
o
a
nice
mix
of
chocolate
roast
and
caramel
easy
to
drink
yet
quite
flavorful
o
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
still
packs
in
a
lot
of
nice
aromas
and
flavors
without
being
fullbodied
o
very
enjoyable
but
not
sure
i
get
why
it
is
called
a
double
cream
stout
i
think
i
had
expectations
of
a
much
creamier
mouthfeel
based
on
the
name
nice
flavors
and
very
enjoyable
id
get
this
one
again
if
i
had
easy
access
to
it
o
this
was
a
decent
cream
stout
has
a
very
nice
roasty
chocolate
taste
that
is
easily
drinkable
but
is
a
little
bit
too
thin
for
the
style
if
bells
was
readily
available
to
me
i
would
probably
drink
this
fairly
often
i
expected
spectacular
and
was
disappointed
but
like
anything
bells
still
believe
this
to
be
better
than
most
this
quality
brew
looks
great
in
the
glass
and
is
a
good
stout
to
have
when
you
are
looking
for
a
little
something
extra
o
very
solid
i
would
drink
this
often
if
it
was
available
nearby
o
an
extremely
tasty
beer
with
alot
of
complexity
for
a
61
brew
bells
always
impresses
recommended
brew
but
theres
nothing
double
or
exciting
about
it
other
then
bitterthiness
it
was
missing
sweetness
and
depth
and
was
over
smoked
thin
nuttyness
o
pretty
pedestrian
to
me
sure
overall
it
is
pretty
good
but
nothing
stands
out
and
makes
me
want
to
go
get
more
my
favorite
of
bells
stouts
easily
approachable
with
lots
of
good
flavors
going
on
after
it
warmed
up
the
aroma
came
out
nicely
too
bad
it
was
all
gone
by
that
point
o
really
nice
i
had
heard
good
things
about
this
brew
and
have
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
awhile
it
does
not
disappoint
glad
i
picked
this
up
o
quite
possibly
the
greatest
flavortoalcohol
ratio
ive
experienced
in
a
beer
so
far
it
would
be
a
shame
to
miss
this
whenever
i
saw
it
on
the
shelves
especially
for
aging
overall
an
easy
drinking
and
tasty
stout
could
use
more
of
a
punch
but
that
may
take
away
from
its
sessionability
better
on
tap
o
this
is
wonderful
and
very
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
and
aroma
was
not
overpowering
and
the
mouth
was
light
and
creamy
wish
i
had
more
right
now
d
this
is
a
really
nice
drinkable
stout
that
provides
lots
of
rich
flavor
without
the
thick
heavy
and
heavy
body
of
an
impy
has
me
wishing
i
picked
up
a
full
6er
with
the
wetter
finish
the
flavors
do
seem
to
drop
out
a
bit
quicker
than
desired
but
overall
nicely
done
i
really
hope
people
understand
and
are
not
mislead
into
thinking
this
is
a
milk
stout
or
anything
similar
it
is
a
plain
stout
that
has
a
rich
and
roasty
creamy
body
that
is
full
flavored
not
sweet
but
not
too
dry
o
this
is
a
fantastic
hit
from
bells
that
i
have
had
on
a
number
of
occasion
but
just
now
am
getting
around
to
reviewing
for
those
who
love
creamy
full
bodied
brews
look
no
further
robust
and
contains
the
balance
of
some
of
the
best
oi
think
this
is
better
than
kalamazoo
should
have
them
side
by
side
in
the
future
a
tad
more
vanilla
and
this
beer
would
be
a
lot
better
o
i
was
honestly
expecting
a
milk
stout
until
i
read
the
description
this
really
is
a
stellar
beer
though
the
peanut
taste
i
was
getting
was
much
better
than
my
experience
with
the
uber
goober
lol
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
and
heavy
nice
lacing
to
the
end
its
aroma
is
complex
leading
off
with
wood
with
nuts
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
flavor
is
a
superb
blend
of
wood
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
followed
by
milk
chocolate
and
anise
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
full
creamy
and
smooth
bells
special
double
cream
stout
is
an
outstanding
brew
well
balanced
and
very
complex
very
highly
recommended
o
this
is
a
solid
entry
at
a
lower
level
abv
stout
i
typically
drink
imperial
stouts
but
i
figured
id
give
this
a
shot
based
on
what
they
have
on
tap
where
i
am
i
dont
regret
my
decision
unlike
my
first
beer
oberon
othis
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
have
recently
decided
to
raise
my
standards
for
a
4
and
this
i
think
still
gets
one
across
the
board
very
nice
blend
of
all
the
malts
pours
dark
black
with
tiny
light
brown
head
aroma
is
very
roasty
with
lots
vanilla
lactose
and
chocolate
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
roasted
coffee
toffee
and
chocolate
solid
sweetness
from
the
lactose
full
bodied
but
not
syrupy
good
carbonation
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
this
one
is
really
good
no
wonder
they
mix
this
in
for
some
black
note
o
overall
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
the
label
is
deceiving
i
wanted
sweeter
and
this
was
light
with
subtle
roast
and
lacking
the
creamy
body
to
support
it
i
also
felt
it
was
over
carbonated
for
the
style
wow
that
was
my
initial
reaction
when
i
popped
this
bad
boy
open
the
beer
was
a
beautiful
golden
shade
of
caramel
the
aroma
of
the
cream
and
barley
is
absolutely
top
notch
the
beer
poured
perfectly
just
the
right
amount
of
head
and
lace
and
the
taste
was
out
of
this
world
this
by
far
is
probably
the
smoothest
beer
ive
ever
had
samuel
adams
needs
to
watch
out
because
bell
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
the
best
american
breweries
this
beer
is
just
flat
out
amazing
i
dont
say
this
often
but
this
beer
is
an
absolute
must
nice
brew
o
i
remember
this
being
better
last
year
but
whos
to
say
after
all
taste
is
subjective
only
paid
3
99
for
a
sixpack
at
total
wine
more
since
its
technically
out
of
season
so
im
not
complaining
o
those
10
malts
took
me
on
a
joyride
smooth
as
silk
very
drinkable
dare
i
say
sessionable
o
its
pretty
much
an
enjoyable
easy
drinker
overall
i
love
sweet
stouts
but
this
one
left
me
pining
for
more
in
the
sweet
and
vanilla
flavor
regions
if
you
look
really
hard
there
might
be
a
little
vanilla
sweetness
but
otherwise
this
is
just
a
solid
american
stout
o
a
worthwhile
brew
not
as
mindboggling
as
a
founders
breakfast
stout
but
quite
good
nice
carbonation
but
i
dont
think
this
will
get
another
purchase
from
me
again
still
a
good
stout
beer
o
not
the
world
changer
some
find
it
to
be
bells
double
cream
stout
is
still
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
lot
of
flavor
in
your
stout
with
a
lower
abv
look
no
further
this
is
a
fine
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
locally
highly
recommended
d
a
fine
sample
o
didnt
really
impress
me
especially
for
being
bells
very
good
tasty
stout
worthy
of
even
the
most
elite
ones
maybe
not
the
best
but
very
solid
indeed
bells
double
cream
stout
pours
jet
black
with
a
voluminous
four
fingers
of
caramel
colored
foam
left
sitting
atop
the
beer
the
head
retention
is
fantastic
and
lacing
is
left
behind
in
a
thick
weblike
pattern
an
absolutely
gorgeous
beer
the
nose
is
fairly
coffee
heavy
but
rather
than
the
usual
heavily
roasted
black
aroma
this
smells
like
coffee
with
a
bit
of
milk
and
sugar
added
the
flavor
brings
more
of
the
same
though
id
say
it
has
a
little
bit
more
roasty
intensity
than
was
found
in
the
nose
the
body
is
wonderfully
creamy
and
smooth
for
a
stout
thats
not
imperialized
in
any
way
its
paired
with
a
nice
subtle
carbonation
that
gives
the
beer
a
little
life
without
taking
away
from
the
fact
that
this
is
a
100
malt
driven
beer
bells
double
cream
stout
is
one
of
the
best
regular
stouts
ive
had
and
a
beer
id
buy
regularly
if
bells
was
sold
in
nj
pours
a
nice
dark
head
and
has
decent
aromas
of
chocolate
and
caramel
verdict
certainly
an
interesting
cream
stout
the
roasted
flavors
are
definitely
very
strong
and
at
times
overly
abrasive
the
body
is
great
though
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
i
probably
wont
be
seen
hunting
this
one
down
again
many
thanks
to
kzoobrew
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
brew
poured
from

rich

definitely
some
raisins
and
vanilla
brown
sugar
some
mocha
chocolate
notes
on
the
end
with
some
nice
roasty
bitterness
this
beer
is
much
more
complex
and
enjoyable
than
i
expected
the
play
between
the
creamy
texture
and
the
borderline
quad
brown
sugar
and
dark
fruit
flavors
are
enjoyable
this
is
a
great
beer
in
my
book
that
i
would
try
again
i
am
finding
that
this
stout
is
growing
on
me
becoming
more
complex
and
interesting
as
it
warms
definitely
something
to
look
for
next
winter
when
my
tastes
turn
back
to
porters
and
stouts
a
solid
stout
overall
this
is
a
tasty
stout
at
6
1
abv
it
is
just
above
the
sessionable
range
nice
beer
to
have
if
you
have
not
experienced
it
yet
overall
pretty
good
enjoyable
and
definitely
worth
having
again
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
creamy
stout
no
bitterness
and
is
rather
sweet
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
stouts
that
i
have
came
across
very
good
lighter
stout
nice
smooth
taste
that
is
malty
but
has
a
sweet
and
lingering
malty
drier
coffee
malt
that
comes
through
in
an
okay
way
is
this
a
great
stout
depends
what
you
think
is
a
good
stout
or
ale
bells
is
a
shitty
brewery
run
by
bad
man
i
hate
to
indorse
larry
bell
but
he
did
a
good
job
and
this
is
his
best
stout
which
isnt
saying
much
o
a
very
nice
stout
probably
may
have
gotten
a
higher
rating
had
i
not
just
had
the
java
stout
an
hour
ago
woops
and
holy
crap
its
not
even
930
this
is
what
the
life
of
a
brewer
is
like
i
suppose
o
this
beer
is
very
rich
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
about
what
i
would
expect
for
a
cream
stout
well
done
o
i
love
almost
all
of
bells
beers
and
especially
their
stout
cant
wait
until
all
stouts
day
again
next
year
cheers
color
is
nearly
pitch
black
a
moderatelysized
dark
tan
head
fades
pretty
quickly
with
not
much
lacing
smell
is
chocolate
with
maybe
some
coffee
notes
roasted
malts
are
prominent
in
the
taste
some
dark
chocolate
notes
in
the
background
with
coffee
flavors
up
front
not
terribly
complex
but
good
mouthfeel
was
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
double
cream
name
might
suggest
o
easy
drinking
stout
loaded
with
flavour
will
easily
satisfy
your
craving
for
a
chocolate
infused
coffee
while
also
quenching
your
thirst
if
only
i
could
buy
a
6er
of
these
at
the
corner
store
in
canada
overall
this
was
just
a
very
average
beer
decent
nose
on
it
a
good
stout
taste
but
nothing
special
dont
get
me
started
on
the
mouthfeel
i
would
have
loved
to
have
the
nose
and
flavor
of
this
beer
on
a
double
cream
stout
body
and
not
such
a
thin
body
very
easy
drinking
and
if
i
were
wanting
to
have
multiple
stouts
this
would
be
one
to
go
for
i
know
im
hitting
this
one
a
little
hard
but
im
still
very
appreciative
of
this
extra
but
outside
of
hopslam
bells
continues
to
underwhelm
me
overall
not
a
good
beer
for
my
second
review
should
have
chose
another
but
i
need
to
jump
into
the
deep
end
and
get
busy
i
like
the
beer
though
it
seemed
lacking
the
first
beer
i
have
had
from
bells
looking
forward
to
the
next
brew
from
comstock
in
summary
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
had
the
smooth
feel
and
subtle
complexities
will
keep
you
drinking
overall
sokay
have
a
few
after
a
steak
an
you
good
o
not
my
favorite
nothing
really
special
about
this
one
cryptic
freshness
date
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
a
dark
with
a
tan
head
which
quickly
recedes
leaving
spotty
lacing
s
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
with
a
characteristic
roasted
malt
aroma
t
milk
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
acidity
not
overly
complex
m
smooth
and
creamy
like
an
oatmeal
stout
not
a
bad
stout
but
not
the
best
ive
had
reviewed
on
01262011
020348
overall
average
but
nothing
spectacular
at
all
definitely
expect
more
from
bells
but
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
measure
pours
a
solid
black
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
displays
moderate
retention
and
lace
smells
of
roast
coffee
milk
and
dark
chocolate
hints
of
sweet
caramel
and
little
to
no
hop
aroma
taste
is
sweet
creamy
and
smooth
whipped
milk
chocolate
mousse
with
hints
of
mocha
caramel
and
roast
sweet
roasty
creamy
and
flavorful
medium
body
with
a
velvety
smooth
creamy
silky
mouthfeel
and
a
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
that
is
a
nice
flavorful
stout
its
hard
to
believe
there
is
no
lactose
in
there
this
is
an
above
average
stout
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
if
i
came
across
it
but
i
dont
think
ill
go
out
of
my
way
to
track
a
bottle
down
i
am
relatively
new
to
stouts
so
i
cant
fairly
compare
this
to
any
one
in
particular
but
this
was
a
very
nice
drink
and
the
flavorsaromas
blend
very
well
for
me
d
pretty
good
better
than
i
had
remembered
it
from
the
glass
very
excited
to
half
64oz
of
it
but
my
wife
tried
it
and
dug
it
so
looks
like
ill
have
help
finishing
this
with
the
game
one
of
the
better
american
stouts
ive
come
across
very
nice
roasted
flavors
and
just
super
drinkable
ill
revisist
this
in
the
future
for
sure
nothing
extreme
or
out
of
the
ordinary
but
they
nailed
the
classic
stout
flavors
just
right
imo
part
of
me
wants
to
say
this
is
pretty
average
for
a
stout
nothing
is
intense
or
stands
out
but
instead
this
blend
of
flavors
seems
to
work
surprisingly
well
overall
very
good
would
definitely
have
again
great
flavor
profile
good
body
without
being
overly
strong
an
excellent
creamy
stout
pours
black
and
bubbly
in
body
with
light
tan
head
that
sticks
around
hefty
aroma
of
butterscotch
cream
light
cocoa
and
vague
hop
presence
tastes
of
smooth
milk
chocolate
cream
light
butter
cola
roast
comes
in
towards
the
finish
along
with
a
hop
bitterness
and
leaves
a
faint
tobacco
finish
pretty
heavy
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
and
medium
bodied
the
flavors
are
welcomed
but
the
carbonation
turns
me
off
wish
it
wasnt
as
fizzy
on
the
palate
and
thicker
in
body
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
on
26
nov
2012
and
it
left
me
with
the
same
impressions
this
time
the
beer
actually
finished
drier
than
previously
which
was
a
greater
disappointment
while
this
is
a
wonderful
stout
it
does
not
feel
creamy
o
a
pleasant
wellbalanced
highly
drinkable
stout
with
good
substance
pours
a
black
color
with
a
thin
cocoa
head
average
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
cbs
snifter
the
nose
is
malt
chocolate
coffee
fairly
simple
and
a
little
weak
nose
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
chocolate
malt
vanilla
and
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
here
very
smooth
and
creamy
in
feel
with
a
somewhat
dry
finish
overall
a
good
brew
that
id
have
again
cheers
o
i
was
shocked
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
it
is
a
fantastic
stout
i
love
the
taste
as
it
is
a
festival
of
flavors
but
in
a
calm
and
elegant
delivery
and
each
one
balanced
perfectly
with
the
next
officially
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
and
if
its
on
tap
im
getting
it
this
is
a
good
stoutbells
tends
to
do
them
well
but
its
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
really
o
a
pretty
solid
stout
tasty
no
huge
thrills
but
nothing
off
at
all
overall
a
tasty
stout
well
balanced
good
drinkability
o
this
was
a
very
solid
cream
stout
easy
drinker
im
definitely
picking
this
one
up
again
overall
extremely
enjoyable
and
balanced
cream
stout
not
too
overpowering
but
rustic
smoke
flavor
is
apparent
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
texture
great
winter
beer
o
very
solid
stout
here
tasty
and
good
mouthfeel
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
no
real
notice
of
the
alcohol
overall
this
is
an
excellent
stout
o
a
great
cream
stout
one
of
my
favorites
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
coffee
some
chocolate
taste
is
the
same
heavy
with
the
coffee
some
underlying
notes
of
chocolate
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
o
man
this
is
an
amazing
stout
this
might
even
be
better
than
the
bbcs
bourbon
barrel
stout
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
evolved
and
complex
as
i
remember
it
which
might
just
be
from
this
particular
bottle
maybe
light
struck
or
batch
either
way
its
still
a
great
beer
4
5
o
an
excellent
stout
that
is
very
drinkable
and
with
no
harsh
flavors
an
excellent
stout
to
introduce
to
someone
who
is
new
to
the
style
overall
easily
my
favorite
session
stout
the
low
abv
allows
you
to
easily
pound
a
few
of
these
no
problem
this
beer
is
fantastic
and
i
could
easily
drink
it
all
night
if
all
american
stouts
tasted
this
way
the
world
would
be
a
better
place
highly
recommend
one
of
the
finer
american
stouts
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
o
good
not
great
but
a
wellbalanced
lighter
stout
overall
well
balanced
and
complex
very
smooth
flavors
and
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
do
this
is
a
respectable
export
stout
whose
lactose
qualities
are
perhaps
the
least
impressive
features
sweetness
is
understated
and
mouthfeel
is
unremarkable
compared
to
other
examples
of
the
stylealthough
it
does
possess
some
noted
unctuous
angles
in
the
smell
and
flavor
strained
milk
descriptors
aside
it
is
dark
and
flavorful
and
does
not
stray
into
strong
territory
which
makes
it
balanced
and
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
lived
up
to
the
expectation
of
a
double
cream
with
lush
silky
viscous
qualities
nicely
cut
by
the
bittersweet
chocolate
i
like
the
6
1
abv
which
gives
it
that
little
extra
oomph
that
some
milk
stouts
cry
for
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
short
cream
colored
head
double
cream
stout
has
a
a
smell
of
toffee
vanilla
dark
chocolate
and
a
burned
aspect
too
it
tastes
of
roasted
malts
more
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
kinda
creamy
as
the
name
would
lead
one
to
guess
an
enjoyable
and
quaffable
stout
while
i
remembered
this
beer
being
better
than
i
thought
it
was
today
it
remains
a
very
solid
beer
for
its
style
it
is
quite
impressive
what
bells
is
able
to
do
with
malt
in
a
beer
that
has
no
special
ingredients
strong
aroma
is
quite
smoky
with
notes
of
burnt
coffee
and
caramel
and
a
hint
of
licorice
it
pours
a
luscious
opaque
sable
with
a
fairly
thick
and
finebubbled
if
not
too
persistent
head
mouthfilling
flavor
has
burnt
coffee
semisweet
chocolate
and
licorice
notes
with
a
hint
of
caramel
smooth
firmbodied
texture
has
a
fair
amount
of
fizz
and
leaves
a
smoky
tingly
finish
i
had
this
before
on
tap
and
as
good
as
it
is
in
a
bottle
as
with
most
beers
it
is
better
from
a
keg
or
barrel
o
very
smooth
creamy
stout
bitterness
is
definitely
kept
in
check
very
enjoyable
another
great
brew
from
bells
o
not
quite
the
beer
i
remember
it
being
but
nonetheless
i
am
glad
i
have
a
couple
to
cellar
dark
brown
in
appearance
with
a
finger
head
and
no
retention
there
is
a
slight
roasty
smell
that
would
be
better
if
it
were
more
upfront
the
malt
taste
is
a
bit
thin
there
is
a
pleasant
coffee
finish
but
this
entire
offering
lacks
the
distinct
roasted
bite
that
would
make
it
complete
o
a
great
smooth
crazy
tasting
stout
bells
does
great
things
as
always
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
average
carbonation
easy
to
drink
overall
not
bad
but
not
that
impressive
ive
had
much
better
stouts
but
this
is
something
that
can
be
enjoyed
even
by
those
who
are
just
being
introduced
to
the
game
overall
a
very
good
easy
drinking
dessert
stout
from
bells

d
i
dont
know
if
this
batch
is
a
bit
off
or
if
my
bottle
is
but
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
brew
i
remember
it
to
be
oh
well
ill
rereview
if
necessary
pours
very
dark
brown
near
black
with
a
thick
medium
tan
head
in
when
using
a
snifter
good
nose
of
roasted
and
sweet
malts
with
a
bready
essence
the
brew
leasves
a
beautiful
lacing
in
the
glass
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
it
is
smooth
creamy
and
delicious
this
is
a
superb
stout
just
an
excellent
effort
from
bells
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
so
long
to
get
this
beer
this
is
an
exceptional
example
of
a
near
perfect
stout
i
can
point
out
no
faults
and
can
give
only
praise
to
this
glorious
stout
do
highly
drinkable
thoroughly
enjoyable
strongly
recommend
this
keg
purchase
was
not
a
mistake
o
really
enjoy
this
beer
creamy
balanced
nicely
not
overly
burdensome
and
quite
tasty
well
done
this
brew
pours
up
very
dark
opaque
with
a
microbubble
soft
pillowy
head
of
medium
size
the
smell
is
strongly
of
malt
and
slightly
of
alcohol
taste
is
malty
smokedroasty
on
the
back
end
and
the
mouthfeel
is
ideal
smooth
overall
a
decent
offering
dont
know
if
i
can
palate
the
smoked
feature
any
more
glad
i
tried
it
o
double
cream
indeed
simply
a
solid
creamy
sweet
coffee
flavored
stout
quite
drinkable
another
good
one
from
bells
o
a
solid
stout
provides
the
profile
with
a
doublecreaminess
that
makes
it
go
down
quite
easy
without
losing
the
character
overall
bells
stouts
are
great
choices
different
from
kalamazoo
but
just
as
good
o
worth
trying
just
for
the
nice
mouthfeel
the
flavors
are
only
slightly
above
average
but
in
its
totality
its
a
good
stout
o
if
you
want
a
creamy
and
sweet
stout
look
no
further
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
double
cream
stout
it
does
a
marvelous
job
of
balancing
the
sweet
flavors
with
the
roasted
character
of
the
stout
fantastic
beer
overall
though
i
really
like
the
nose
on
this
beer
and
its
the
most
impresssive
thing
about
it
so
i
dont
seem
to
mind
ramming
my
shnoze
in
the
glass
and
having
another
sip
overall
a
very
nice
stout
i
love
the
creamy
flavor
it
offsets
some
of
the
bitter
coffee
flavors
you
get
with
most
stouts
yet
you
dont
lose
the
traditional
stout
flavor
not
as
creamy
as
i
was
expecting
but
a
very
good
stout
overall
a
nice
smooth
flavorful
stout
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
with
a
ton
of
complex
aromas
and
flavor
to
strike
the
balance
of
smooth
and
complex
is
seemingly
not
an
easy
task
this
is
a
really
nice
brew
and
i
commend
bells
on
a
job
well
done
cheers
incredible
its
got
more
to
it
than
their
kalamazoo
stout
but
doesnt
fill
you
up
like
the
expedition
a
somewhat
special
stout
that
wont
knock
you
over
o
a
good
stout
but
not
one
that
i
would
return
to
too
often
b
this
is
a
tasty
brew
as
previously
stated
nice
balance
not
too
sweet
or
heavy
great
beer
to
have
with
a
nice
stew
on
a
cold
winters
evening
o
very
nicely
done
for
the
nice
without
the
huge
alcohol
roasted
barrel
flavors
a
very
enjoyable
stout
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
one
pours
a
milk
chocolate
brown
in
color
very
smooth
and
creamy
medium
in
bodied
with
a
beige
lacing
around
the
glass
it
smells
of
creamy
chocolates
light
roast
light
coffee
witha
slight
bitterness
and
a
slightly
sweet
and
creamy
finish
it
is
very
smooth
and
finishes
light
the
flavors
consist
of
smooth
and
creamy
milk
chocolate
with
a
light
and
slightly
bitter
roast
its
excellent
the
aftertaste
is
both
light
and
very
appealing
it
is
exceptionally
smooth
and
drinks
perfectly
for
the
style
its
too
drinkable
and
perfect
for
cold
weather
i
love
this
one
overall
a
very
good
light
stout
wont
fill
you
up
like
expedition
but
has
enough
flavors
to
satisfy
most
stout
lovers
o
a
good
stout
a
bit
strong
in
flavor
and
sweetness
boa
race
of
a
thousand
camels
pours
a
dark
brown
nearly
black
body
with
less
than
a
centimeter
of
beige
head
theres
some
nice
strands
of
bubbles
that
sift
through
the
surface
of
the
liquid
but
there
is
littletono
retention
of
the
head
itself
tiny
scattered
patches
of
bubbles
remain
as
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
grounds
caramel
and
toastedburned
sugar
some
dark
fruits
come
together
in
the
rear
the
taste
is
of
dark
fruit
molasses
a
touch
of
milk
chocolate
coffee
roasted
malt
and
a
hoard
of
cane
sugar
the
sugar
carries
over
into
the
mouth
where
is
leaves
a
very
sticky
resinous
finish
to
the
seemingly
thinner
beer
overall
a
decent
stout
but
it
seems
to
have
an
overpowering
sugar
sensation
that
is
not
quite
balanced
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
notes
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
bells
has
to
offer
fullbodied
and
rich
in
flavor
yet
very
wellbalanced
it
has
superb
drinkability
and
pulls
off
a
style
of
beer
that
normally
calls
for
other
ingredients
to
give
it
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
it
has
overall
this
is
a
cool
beer
much
like
a
chocolate
stout
that
uses
no
chocolate
i
like
that
this
beer
can
achieve
the
aspects
of
a
milk
stout
without
anything
added
in
a
great
sitting
beer
and
one
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
great
i
love
this
beer
its
malty
and
toasty
im
really
feeling
some
coffee
with
this
beer
far
more
pronounced
than
the
nose
slight
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
really
wonderful
bitterness
throughout
o
another
solid
offering
from
bells
a
nice
stout
that
hasnt
been
imperialized
just
a
nice
brew
very
drinkable
a
good
stout
to
intro
someone
to
the
style
appearance
is
dark
very
dark
poured
from
a
bottle
theres
almost
no
head
and
later
a
thin
rapidly
sinking
lacing
smells
of
vanilla
nutmeg
raisin
molasses
fruit
red
licorice
black
licorice
taste
is
bold
with
spicy
raisin
and
coffee
up
front
quickly
gives
a
blast
of
cocoa
and
roasted
malt
the
licorice
notes
arent
far
behind
extremely
creamy
mouthfeel
very
light
prickly
carbonation
a
bit
too
syrupy
and
sugary
for
me
but
i
suppose
thats
the
idea
of
a
double
cream
stout
still
i
wish
there
was
something
to
counterbalance
the
sweetness
and
gummy
residue
taste
is
complex
and
very
interesting
for
fans
of
the
style
this
is
not
to
be
missed
overall
ive
never
been
truly
disappointed
by
bells
and
this
is
no
exception
its
a
very
good
beer
though
not
a
great
beer
o
not
a
bad
cream
stout
but
not
in
elite
territory
o
impressive
stout
to
say
the
least
they
just
oneupped
a
whole
lot
of
stouts
in
the
world
oits
good
id
drink
this
many
times
again
overall
very
tasty
and
appealing
brew
mouthfeel
and
taste
slightly
outshine
the
other
qualities
its
somewhat
standard
but
also
of
tremendous
quality
im
definitely
a
fan
of
bells
special
double
cream
stout
overall
a
very
good
beer
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
fallwinter
low
enough
in
abv
to
drink
several
but
tasty
this
isnt
a
study
in
subtle
layers
of
flavor
but
a
study
of
how
to
make
a
very
tasty
nonimperial
stout
another
great
bells
fallwinter
offering
like
all
of
them
o
only
great
things
to
say
about
this
they
did
a
fantastic
job
playing
up
the
soft
sweet
flavors
a
stout
can
produce
well
keep
coming
back
to
this
beer
overall
smooth
malty
sessionable
goodness
definitely
recommend
this
one
no
real
flaws
it
lives
up
to
be
the
type
of
solid
milk
stout
that
one
would
expect
from
bells
overall
nice
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
was
not
as
creamy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
more
of
a
dry
stout
in
my
opinion
but
good
overall
drinkability
enjoyable
some
of
the
soy
sauce
charater
dissipates
over
time
and
with
each
sip
which
is
great
because
its
a
big
flaw
otherwise

another
highlight
of
the
2011
brass
hat
brewing
brew
fest
in
watertown
ct
last
weekend
this
bells
beauty
shows
an
opaque
brownblack
with
a
thin
but
solid
light
brown
head
lacing
follows
suit
and
coats
nicely
the
aroma
leads
heavily
with
prominent
coffee
like
a
classic
milky
regular
undercurrents
of
light
chocolate
and
sweet
seaweed
round
it
out
interestingly
the
flavor
really
nails
my
remembrances
of
good
old
fashioned
cream
soda
with
plenty
of
vanilla
and
light
coffee
mixed
in
along
with
a
sweet
dose
of
chocolate
milk
a
bit
of
a
treat
perhaps
on
the
dessert
side
of
the
beer
world
but
not
terribly
so
although
it
had
a
somewhat
milky
feel
i
didnt
find
it
perfectly
creamy
it
was
actually
a
bit
aqueous
and
a
little
thinner
than
i
anticipated
mediumlight
bodied
to
my
tastes
especially
after
a
few
imperial
stouts
it
was
fairly
drinkable
for
the
style
especially
if
you
have
a
fondness
of
sodalike
brews
and
sweet
treats
i
liked
it
fine
though
i
probably
expected
a
little
more
guts
from
a
bells
brew
thebeeralmanac
com
pours
the
blackest
of
black
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
recedes
very
coffeechocolate
forward
nose
taste
heavily
leans
towards
chocolate
and
burnt
malt
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
cherry
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
the
only
real
ding
i
dont
get
the
smooth
and
creamy
here
its
much
more
on
the
astringent
side
of
things
although
ive
had
worse
in
that
regard
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
stout
not
one
id
run
around
looking
for
but
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
it
were
it
offered
to
me
mind
a
nice
stout
other
than
a
slightly
higher
than
normal
creaminess
out
of
a
bottle
pretty
standard
but
well
executed
overall
this
is
a
tasty
stout
but
it
isnt
quite
as
creamy
as
i
was
hoping
all
things
considered
i
am
still
happy
to
have
five
more
in
my
fridge
but
i
was
just
expecting
something
slightly
different
i
give
a
schlitz
about
this
stout
i
really
liked
this
one
overall
bells
doesnt
disappoint
drinkable
flavorful
and
complex
taste
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
much
more
so
than
i
expected
because
i
have
been
really
displeased
with
the
majority
of
bells
offerings
that
i
have
sampled
to
date
i
had
this
following
dieu
du
ciel
aphrodisiaque
and
although
it
was
no
where
as
good
it
held
its
own
in
the
flavor
department
not
a
beer
i
will
turn
away
if
offered
and
i
would
have
it
again
glad
i
sampled
it
for
sure
overall
a
very
a
good
stout
nice
flavor
and
enjoyable
skål
overall
while
its
not
that
complex
and
it
certainly
is
dialed
back
a
little
from
more
other
stouts
on
the
market
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
has
some
good
flavors
kicking
around
in
the
bottle
another
solid
job
by
bells
they
had
me
scared
there
for
a
moment
on
this
one
o
tasty
stouts
arent
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
not
outstanding
but
overall
a
pretty
solid
stout
with
complexity
o
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
ordering
this
in
a
bar
however
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
the
flavor
it
seemed
to
be
very
one
sided
the
initial
cream
sweetness
holds
through
but
not
as
many
other
flavors
come
out
after
i
feel
like
even
with
a
year
under
its
belt
this
beer
might
not
round
out
o
great
stout
very
reminiscent
of
deschutes
obsidian
stout
these
beers
could
be
brothers
obsidian
gets
a
slight
edge
in
my
book
because
of
the
bigger
smokiness
any
east
coast
lovers
of
this
beer
need
to
try
obsidian
pleasant
rich
dark
ale
quite
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
caramel
with
a
darker
overtone
distinct
touch
of
cocoa
quite
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
quick
pour
but
carbonation
dissipates
handsome
dark
reddish
brown
in
the
glass
topped
with
a
beige
head
good
on
drinkability
only
modest
bitterness
faint
touch
of
sourness
and
a
good
dose
of
burnt
malt
along
with
the
mellower
flavors
grateful
we
have
another
three
bottles
to
reevaluate
this
nice
cream
stout
thanks
urbancaver
for
another
great
one
and
thanks
walows
for
sharing
it
with
me
overall
i
havent
visited
this
brew
in
a
number
of
years
and
i
forgot
what
i
was
missing
bells
nails
a
easy
drinking
and
complex
stout
overall
this
is
a
excellent
representation
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
had
i
would
suggest
this
to
any
stout
drinker
out
there
who
has
yet
to
have
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
this
one
the
pour
created
an
impressive
finger
of
deeptan
head
with
excellent
retention
color
was
obsidian
black
allowing
zero
light
penetration
nose
had
a
sweetish
smell
like
dried
dark
fruits
underlain
by
a
light
smokiness
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
dried
dark
fruits
smoke
and
charcoal
in
the
mouth
wow
finish
was
incredibly
silky
smooth
very
chocolaty
especially
on
the
extreme
finish
i
have
been
on
a
stout
kick
the
last
day
or
so
and
this
struck
me
as
more
of
a
dessert
beerstout
given
its
lingering
sweetness
this
was
the
third
different
way
that
i
have
had
this
beer
and
each
time
it
was
enjoyable
that
has
to
count
for
something
o
a
very
good
stout
not
particularly
deep
or
complex
but
great
flavors
a
real
pleasant
creaminess
and
overall
a
very
enjoyable
drink
do
packs
the
flavors
in
at
6
1abv
a
nice
after
dinner
treat
thanks
mammothbrew
the
mouthfeel
is
full
rich
not
well
carbonated
and
creamy
from
my
weekend
notes
roasty
so
roasty
with
a
chocolatecream
heart
and
a
dry
soul
this
bottle
makes
for
quite
the
tasty
pint
the
nose
makes
for
no
big
hoopla
as
does
the
pour
not
the
best
opening
no
but
the
flavor
makes
up
for
lost
ground
full
of
bitter
cocoa
and
roasted
malt
but
with
a
modestly
hoppy
finish
that
accentuates
the
blackened
fade
the
feel
is
bubbly
yet
with
a
decadent
smoothness
that
makes
this
brew
disappear
much
too
quickly
nice
stout
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
huge
3
inch
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
nice
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
chocolate
caramel
and
aromas
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
dark
fruit
with
subdued
coffee
and
cocoa
flavors
on
the
finish
very
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
quickly
fades
this
beer
has
a
low
almost
flat
level
of
carbonation
making
it
thick
and
chewy
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
that
apparently
uses
10
different
malts
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
most
likely
d
this
is
a
really
good
beer
very
malty
but
it
really
works
with
this
beer
it
has
very
good
flavor
and
is
highly
drinkable
if
only
i
could
get
bells
in
ma
this
is
a
very
nice
one
from
bells
aside
from
being
a
very
good
beer
pick
this
one
up
to
satisfy
a
craving
for
malts
or
if
you
want
something
sweet
dark
black
with
hints
of
red
in
the
light
very
little
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
malty
and
roasty
with
hints
of
dark
cocoa
rich
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
rich
chocolate
notes
a
hint
of
burnt
caramel
roasted
coffee
tones
and
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
chewy
creamy
chalky
smooth
silky
chocolate
velvet
very
tasty
and
smooth
awesome
beer
o
a
very
good
beer
one
i
make
sure
i
snag
a
6er
of
at
least
each
season
it
rolls
out
a
real
treat
this
is
a
creamy
relatively
sweet
chocolatey
stout
with
enough
bitterness
to
balance
with
a
vibrant
vanilla
hint
throughout
that
really
makes
this
a
spectacular
brew
with
plenty
of
depth
overall
a
nice
ale
that
could
be
more
fullbodied
but
still
manages
to
please
recommended
d
overall
a
good
lightbodied
stout
something
id
like
to
try
on
nitro
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
black
thick
liquid
its
got
a
creamy
brown
head
the
lacing
is
pretty
decent
on
this
brew
the
smell
is
rich
and
roasted
has
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
as
well
the
taste
is
on
the
stronger
side
its
got
a
good
roasted
malt
base
that
carries
the
beer
from
start
to
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thicker
than
some
of
bells
beers
overall
its
not
a
bad
brew
its
worth
revisiting
for
sure
overallnice
stout
nice
late
night
stout
right
before
bed
refreshing
and
sweet
would
go
great
with
some
chocolate
cake
another
winner
from
bells
stouts
from
bells
and
i
havent
always
gotten
along
so
well
but
double
cream
is
solid
finish
just
north
of
ok
if
it
finished
the
way
it
smelled
it
would
be
a
home
run
but
instead
its
a
hard
hit
double
that
just
missed
being
a
triple
o
a
good
beer
would
be
a
touch
better
if
the
flavors
were
a
bit
bolder
but
still
very
good
and
lives
up
to
its
name
of
being
creamy
a
stout
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
for
sure
o
i
think
i
got
a
bad
bottle
had
this
on
tap
before
and
liked
it
this
seems
just
bad
o
a
good
beer
that
i
would
get
again
if
it
was
available
locally
for
a
decent
price
not
one
id
seek
out
though
the
drinkablility
was
good
m
near
perfect
creamy
like
no
other
goes
down
with
such
ease
d
another
solid
offering
from
bells
nothing
about
it
is
really
special
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
it
again
because
of
its
sweet
character
this
beer
probably
wont
appeal
to
everyone
however
if
youre
into
creamy
chocolaty
easydrinking
stouts
youll
feel
right
at
home
personally
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
had
a
difficult
time
setting
the
glass
down
drink
good
carbonation
d
my
friend
that
gave
me
this
did
so
because
in
three
hours
hed
only
drank
2
5
and
im
not
surprised
t
the
mouthfeel
absolutely
steals
the
show
here
incredibly
creamy
and
velvety
notes
of
roasted
malt
milk
chocolate
molasses
and
cream
soda
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
with
a
touch
of
dark
roasted
coffee
pretty
nicely
done
d
aside
from
the
extreme
richness
this
one
goes
down
without
effort
the
drawback
however
is
that
i
feel
like
i
just
ate
a
huge
wedge
of
chocolate
cake
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
aroma
and
feel
win
belly
feels
good
despite
the
companys
explanation
lactose
or
no
lactose
with
a
name
like
double
cream
stout
i
would
have
expected
something
a
bit
sweeter
o
a
very
good
beer
that
was
very
enjoyable
to
drink
overall
impression
a
flavorful
dark
malt
dominated
american
stout
im
not
sure
it
would
fit
the
style
guidelines
for
an
american
stout
due
to
the
lack
of
hop
character
but
thats
probably
the
best
style
for
this
beer
bells
can
make
a
great
stout
and
this
is
no
different
easily
quaffable
and
nicely
done
recommended
overall
this
is
smooth
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
not
overly
sweet
yet
still
has
some
stout
kick
to
it
i
get
no
alcohol
in
each
drink
a
nice
twist
on
a
stout
i
enjoyed
mostly
cause
it
wasnt
overly
sweet
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
a
strictly
black
pour
with
a
thin
mocha
cap
aromas
of
caramel
toasted
hops
mocha
and
coffee
are
all
distincly
present
and
making
my
mouth
water
a
very
creamy
brew
with
great
toasty
notes
with
a
lactic
finish
that
lets
you
know
that
the
cream
is
ther
the
carbonation
is
nice
on
the
pallet
and
the
full
bodied
brew
is
creamy
and
thick
going
down
the
hatch
the
bittnerness
does
get
a
little
harsh
after
a
full
pint
and
is
actually
a
little
mroe
typical
of
a
chocolate
stout
overall
the
beer
is
very
drinkabel
though
maybe
only
slightly
out
of
bounds
with
regard
to
style
o
as
mentioned
in
the
taste
portion
this
begs
to
be
drank
on
my
next
trip
to
bowling
green
i
may
pick
up
an
entire
6
pack
of
this
if
available
not
too
bad
this
one
but
not
a
beer
which
blows
you
out
of
your
socks
o
a
pretty
darn
sweet
milk
stout
alot
of
dark
sweetness
in
this
one
o
a
much
roastier
sweeter
stout
than
usual
but
still
excellent
easy
to
drink
due
to
smoothness
overall
definitely
some
alcohol
present
in
this
despite
the
moderate
level
d
4
5
this
is
a
very
tasty
stout
that
isnt
all
that
heavy
and
has
a
very
good
flavor
profile
im
a
big
fan
of
coffee
and
the
sweetness
that
is
combined
with
it
in
here
from
the
malts
works
very
well
and
isnt
overbearing
for
the
style
i
could
drink
as
much
of
this
one
as
any
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
bells
this
brew
is
mediumfull
bodied
mouthfeel
is
silky
cremy
and
a
bit
sticky
it
rich
and
rewarding
definetly
worth
a
try
full
bodied
and
moderately
smooth
good
carbonation
level
with
a
surprisingly
clean
bitter
finish
not
quite
what
i
expected
not
really
a
milky
or
creamy
feel
but
still
good
and
smooth
very
drinkable
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
stout
not
quite
what
i
expected
but
very
good
overall
a
very
good
stout
and
a
shining
star
in
bells
offerings
creamy
and
easy
drinking
this
is
one
that
you
could
drink
all
night
personally
i
liked
it
and
would
definitely
drink
this
again
overall
a
very
enjoyable
well
balanced
yet
well
flavored
stout
i
thought
the
double
cream
stout
would
be
related
to
the
flavor
not
the
mouthfeel
unfortunately
not
the
case
the
flavor
is
interesting
but
not
what
i
had
hoped
for
however
the
mouthfeel
is
worth
giving
it
shot
this
one
is
designed
for
drinking
all
through
your
session
delicious
smooth
easy
m
creamy
is
the
word
even
the
carbonation
isnt
too
biting
my
only
critique
is
that
it
could
be
a
bit
thicker
but
at
6
1
abv
its
hard
to
really
achieve
that
big
body
typical
of
russian
imperials
drink
and
overall
honestly
bells
has
some
fantastic
stout
the
list
goes
on
and
on
but
this
one
is
a
personal
favorite
great
balance
and
awesome
textureflavor
profile
always
a
treat
when
i
can
enjoy
one
of
these
guys
o
another
nice
offering
from
bells
really
nice
stout
and
one
that
i
think
could
be
consumed
multiple
times
in
a
sitting
overall
this
is
pretty
drinkable
a
lot
of
flavor
and
a
very
good
mouthfeel
not
my
favorite
stout
by
any
means
but
ill
have
another
o
this
is
an
extremely
tasty
beer
that
i
feel
falls
just
short
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
left
hand
milk
stout
and
terrapin
moohoo
which
is
less
a
knock
on
this
excellent
offering
by
bells
than
it
is
a
testament
to
the
quality
of
those
other
two
brews
given
that
terrapin
doesnt
distribute
this
far
north
i
would
easily
buy
this
if
left
hand
pulled
out
of
wisconsin
sampled
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
poured
completely
black
with
a
brief
dark
beige
head
that
left
a
wispy
cap
a
few
lazy
lacings
on
the
glass
with
each
sip
sweet
chocolate
aroma
is
dominant
with
rich
roasted
malt
and
light
coffee
aromas
as
well
thick
creamy
feel
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
but
pleasant
nonetheless
nice
balance
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
in
the
beginning
with
coffee
flavors
rolling
through
the
middle
leading
to
a
prominent
hoppy
finish
hop
bitterness
lingers
a
bit
smooth
and
tasty
with
a
nice
variety
of
aromas
and
flavors
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
finger
of
tan
foamy
head
nose
is
sweet
with
cocoa
espresso
notes
dark
and
complex
malts
a
sense
of
roasted
beans
taste
is
full
good
coffee
flavour
mixed
with
roasted
malts
sweet
and
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
creamy
yet
smooth
and
dry
a
decent
stout
but
not
mind
blowing
or
bells
best
o
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
i
have
a
hard
time
keeping
it
in
my
fridge
o
a
better
than
good
beer
appearance
and
smell
could
be
better
taste
was
very
good
which
is
the
most
important
thing
yummy
yums
the
bros
say
bells
beer
taste
too
oxidized
too
bad
they
do
not
live
20
miles
from
the
brewery
cuz
mine
is
as
fresh
as
the
morning
dew
this
stout
has
a
dark
rich
brownishblack
with
a
gorgeous
creamy
head
pour
complex
notes
of
malts
i
like
my
stouts
to
be
more
robust
and
less
chocolaty
this
one
delivers
nice
and
sweets
with
a
smooth
finish
my
new
favorite
stout
thanks
again
michigan
for
making
me
smile
with
great
beer
a
nice
stout
but
a
bit
underwhelming
i
know
everything
doesnt
have
to
be
big
but
with
special
in
the
name
i
was
hoping
there
would
be
something
of
the
sort
still
a
nice
and
very
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
lives
up
to
the
beers
name
creamy
smooth
velvety
texture
is
a
great
match
for
the
milk
chocolate
flavors
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
smoothness
of
the
beer
lower
abv
for
the
style
and
softer
flavors
i
really
like
the
balance
this
beer
has
and
the
fact
that
it
isnt
going
for
a
world
record
in
some
chocolatey
or
coffeelike
category
this
is
just
a
well
made
stout
that
doesnt
do
anything
extraordinarily
but
doesnt
do
anything
really
wrong
either
d
i
really
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
on
this
brew
im
assuming
oats
were
used
and
they
definitely
add
that
creaminess
that
is
mentioned
in
the
name
overall
good
flavors
but
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
level
for
me
very
creamy
and
smooth
despite
the
carbonation
though
and
the
sugary
sweetness
matches
the
malts
just
right
for
such
a
dark
beer
the
flavors
are
fairly
mild
nothing
really
overpowering
as
far
as
the
flavors
go
and
they
fit
together
nicely
easy
to
drink
andvery
well
balanced
drinkability
full
flavored
and
quite
tasty
gorgeous
in
the
glass
drinkable
very
much
so
would
order
another
highly
regarded
and
recommended
d
this
is
a
great
beer
this
has
great
balance
and
i
would
get
this
beer
again
anytime
i
wouldnt
make
this
a
goto
stout
the
mouthfeel
its
creamy
as
said
above
also
is
fairly
thick
delicious
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
it
does
drink
like
its
a
bit
higher
in
abv
though
a
great
stout
im
glad
i
picked
up
the
last
single
at
a
local
bottle
shop
recommended
d
i
dont
need
another
it
tastes
quite
good
and
the
roasted
flavor
is
a
big
hit
with
my
tastebuds
but
the
thickness
would
get
to
me
after
a
while
one
is
plenty
i
would
consider
buying
again
at
some
point
but
i
have
a
few
other
stouts
with
this
flavor
that
arent
as
heavy
and
more
my
type
d
a
nice
drinking
beer
for
a
colder
night
a
little
bit
higher
abv
will
keep
you
warm
but
also
overall
limits
the
beer
in
terms
of
pint
after
pint
drinking
a
nice
stout
like
usual
from
bells
always
look
forward
to
this
one
coming
out
wow
thats
dark
black
as
a
matter
of
fact
head
is
brown
stiff
and
sticky
first
smell
is
yeasty
roasty
and
slight
metallic
theres
something
unpleasant
in
the
smell
that
i
cant
place
barnyard
wet
leather
taste
has
that
same
unpleasantness
it
got
a
little
better
as
it
burned
off
during
warming
dispite
this
distration
i
do
get
some
nice
chocolate
with
a
pretty
nice
dry
finish
that
not
to
puckering
mouthfeel
is
leaning
toward
creamy
with
a
body
surprisingly
lighter
than
expected
but
not
watery
by
any
means
still
that
being
said
ill
finish
this
one
but
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
sorry
bells
drinkability
pretty
good
i
like
the
fact
the
roasted
malts
do
not
dominate
but
it
is
still
a
solid
stout
it
just
tastes
like
a
bells
stout
this
was
pretty
darn
good
frankly
im
surprised
id
gladly
have
this
again
drinkability
ive
had
better
more
robust
complex
stouts
but
this
one
is
solid
enough
to
be
considered
a
good
example
very
easy
to
drink
and
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
nothing
over
complicated
more
than
anything
a
nononsence
pretty
enjoyable
stout
the
two
things
that
stand
our
are
the
its
thick
mouthfeel
and
the
stunning
visual
appearance
drinkability
very
good
brew
the
combination
of
all
of
the
malts
makes
an
interesting
taste
nice
and
complex
d
quite
drinkable
do
to
its
smoothness
not
as
filling
as
one
might
expect
from
a
double
cream
either
d
the
sweetness
and
not
quite
extraordinary
taste
keep
this
from
going
down
too
quickly
but
i
did
enjoy
this
glass
carbonation
doesnt
seem
high
but
the
bubbles
make
this
feel
a
bit
crisp
on
the
tongue
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
otherwise
but
not
syrupy
or
overtly
heavy
nice
long
finish
that
is
roasty
and
sweet
very
nice
excellent
brew
great
drinking
d
there
is
almost
too
much
malt
to
this
brew
if
thats
your
thing
then
you
may
love
it
to
me
this
didnt
really
taste
like
a
stout
it
tasted
like
a
more
brown
style
of
beer
d
decent
abv
coupled
with
a
very
interesting
taste
range
and
creaminess
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
stouts
like
this
but
this
is
a
great
beer
for
certain
occasions
from
notes
november
2010
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
minimal
head
that
remains
as
a
bit
of
foam
on
the
surface
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
following
it
mouthfeel
is
very
good
smooth
rich
about
medium
for
a
stout
with
that
odd
creamy
coating
feeling
that
milk
stouts
often
have
taste
is
good
and
wellbalanced
with
a
strong
sweet
roasted
malt
flavor
up
front
thats
complemented
by
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
a
very
solid
stout
though
the
flavor
could
be
more
complex
d
yeah
ill
have
another
served
ontap
at
charlie
hoopers
in
kc
nice
looking
pour
12
inch
dark
head
over
midnight
black
beer
smell
is
really
faint
but
mostly
of
roasted
malts
this
is
a
mild
creamy
tasty
stout
malts
predominate
not
sensing
any
hops
not
much
bitterness
or
too
much
roasted
flavor
a
very
good
choice
as
a
session
beer
for
a
stout
pours
a
thick
opaque
pitch
black
thick
is
an
unstatement
which
i
believe
hinder
this
beer
a
bit
very
cream
sodaesque
while
the
flavors
of
roast
malts
coco
and
coffee
and
hoppy
alcohol
bite
at
the
finish
was
nice
the
heavy
cream
is
fatiguing
and
muddled
the
nuances
of
this
brew
a
bit
nevertheless
this
a
sip
enjoy
kinda
brew
d
a
midlevel
abv
and
the
vast
array
of
flavors
and
feel
make
this
fun
to
drink
definitely
worth
seeking
out
the
profile
gives
the
most
after
it
warms
a
bit
so
sip
this
one
d
it
seems
bells
can
do
no
wrong
i
have
yet
to
have
any
of
their
beer
that
is
even
mediocre
great
beer
recommended
drinkability
is
just
right
for
this
beer
great
flavor
and
mouthfeel
d
definitely
could
drink
a
few
bottles
of
this
in
one
session
drinks
very
nicely
for
a
stout
with
that
much
flavor
i
can
only
imagine
what
this
would
be
like
on
tap
especially
a
nitro
tap
the
cpj
d
another
great
brew
from
bells
never
disappointed
with
this
brewery
will
definitely
have
another
overall
it
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
however
at
this
price
point
i
expect
it
to
be
a
lot
more
balanced
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
and
i
can
recommend
many
more
before
this
one
however
in
no
way
is
it
a
bad
beer
with
its
dark
color
and
hearty
stout
taste
a
very
dark
pour
that
yields
a
on
finger
khaki
brown
head
that
recedes
very
quickly
into
a
thin
ring
around
the
edges
with
minimal
lacing
smell
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
taste
is
of
sweet
toasted
maltschocolate
and
caramel
that
finishes
dry
despite
how
sweet
it
begins
each
sip
is
better
than
the
rest
as
it
warms
and
the
carbonation
mellows
the
creamy
smoothness
this
bottle
claims
begins
to
come
through
i
would
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
as
the
booze
is
low
d
close
to
room
temp
this
really
just
goes
down
so
easy
and
i
could
see
a
future
with
a
few
more
its
a
nice
break
from
the
huge
viscous
stouts
ive
been
settling
in
with
so
far
this
winter
nov
2011
forgot
i
previously
reviewed
this
one
looking
back
on
my
old
review
i
still
feel
the
same
style
is
along
the
lines
of
beer
i
favor
but
overall
its
quite
an
ordinary
brew
there
are
roasted
flavors
throughout
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
but
fairly
blah
d
pretty
good
beer
takes
some
time
to
drink
and
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
one
but
pretty
drinkable
for
a
stout
abv
is
lower
than
i
would
like
for
a
beer
this
big
though
could
use
more
warmth
and
a
bigger
punch
to
it
i
have
no
idea
what
took
me
so
long
to
enter
a
review
for
this
guy
this
era
ends
now
it
pours
a
sleek
obsidian
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
sandy
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
light
vanilla
light
maple
syrup
and
very
light
molasses
a
mild
sweetness
hangs
above
it
all
a
whisper
confirming
the
style
the
taste
ups
the
roast
ante
a
bit
and
adds
a
touch
of
coffee
but
beyond
that
everything
else
from
the
smell
remains
constant
the
body
is
a
slightly
hefty
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
silky
feel
overall
other
than
a
carbonation
a
smidgen
too
active
for
my
tastes
here
this
is
a
great
milk
stout
get
some
d
good
drinkability
for
a
heavier
stout
d
easy
drinker
for
sure
definitely
a
well
crafted
beer
only
managed
to
drink
a
quarter
of
it
through
this
review
but
it
definitely
goes
down
easily
i
really
like
this
one
and
it
is
a
great
malty
stout
the
bottle
has
a
batch
number
proudly
stamped
on
it
no
freshness
date
pours
a
thick
oily
black
color
dark
brown
one
finger
head
decent
lacing
dark
roasted
malt
hits
the
nose
first
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
it
has
a
bitter
taste
with
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
espresso
very
creamy
as
the
description
says
good
but
a
bit
thin
feeling
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
extraordinarily
creamy
and
complements
the
taste
drinkability
is
above
average
the
sweetness
brings
it
down
a
tad
theres
not
much
alcohol
flavor
to
it
and
it
makes
a
solid
chocolate
filled
stout
leaning
fairly
heavily
towards
the
dark
chocolate
side
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
would
definitely
recommend
as
soon
as
i
poured
this
bells
special
cream
stout
i
knew
it
meant
business
tit
pours
black
as
pitch
with
a
golden
caramel
head
the
smell
is
slighter
that
i
would
expect
the
taste
is
a
robust
blackness
it
is
blackened
and
chocolaty
its
a
good
cold
evening
beer
you
dont
pound
this
beer
it
pounds
you
with
flavor
lulz
drink
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
goes
down
quite
easy
a
very
good
quality
beer
nothing
thrilling
but
a
good
stout
a
very
nice
beer
nothing
thrilling
but
a
good
beer
d
i
find
this
beer
enjoyable
and
drinkable
but
not
at
an
exceptional
level
d
drinkable
but
there
are
better
cream
stouts
out
there
get
the
feeling
this
one
is
rated
well
because
its
bells
not
because
its
great
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
brown
a
whippy
darkishtan
head
clings
all
over
the
glass
smell
is
very
nice
earthy
malts
with
a
bit
of
mineral
taste
is
sweet
and
milkchocolatey
more
than
anything
a
creme
brulee
of
beer
ends
rather
dry
with
a
touch
of
bitter
feel
is
a
little
creamy
yet
pithy
at
the
same
time
a
little
reserved
but
its
exactly
what
this
beer
set
out
to
do
and
it
was
good
to
sample
drinks
good
but
i
like
a
bit
more
oomph
in
a
stout
o
overall
i
think
that
this
beer
could
definately
use
something
else
in
the
flavor
it
is
not
that
this
beer
is
bad
but
more
like
it
is
lacking
something
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
more
than
one
great
work
d
i
must
say
for
not
being
much
of
a
fan
of
bells
brews
i
really
do
love
this
one
can
i
have
another
tasty
brew
but
probably
better
fresh
and
a
bit
sweet
for
my
liking
the
carbonation
is
flatish
which
hurts
the
appearance
nose
and
palate
a
bit
watery
and
thin
for
the
style
d
really
good
d
this
had
to
be
an
off
batch
but
i
will
review
what
i
purchased
this
was
extremely
disappointing
with
the
dominating
sourness
hopefully
this
review
doesnt
get
deleted
like
my
review
of
thomas
hardys
this
is
just
godawful
like
drinking
vinegar
i
hate
that
this
looks
decent
because
it
deserves
a
lower
score
i
would
honestly
rather
have
a
bud
light
right
now
but
am
masochistically
punishing
myself
to
finish
it
in
order
to
have
a
legit
review
i
hate
myself
for
opening
this
beer
as
my
nightcap
the
only
beer
i
ever
had
which
was
more
challenging
to
finish
was
the
aforementioned
thomas
hardys
each
sip
is
like
acid
eating
away
my
entire
digestive
system
drinkable
and
clean
this
one
has
a
lower
enough
alcohol
volume
to
be
one
you
go
back
to
and
it
feels
about
the
same
i
dig
its
a
stout
thats
basically
like
a
milk
stout
but
has
a
bit
of
hop
character
to
keep
it
interesting
d
it
isnt
too
strong
or
thick
but
it
isnt
very
drinkable
the
flavors
get
a
bit
annoying
like
the
rest
of
bellss
stouts
i
dont
get
it
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thinner
than
expected
moderate
carbonation
not
one
of
my
favorite
bells
beers
it
becomes
smoother
and
roastier
as
it
warms
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
good
beer
but
i
enjoy
louder
stouts
this
was
mild
and
from
what
i
understand
i
need
to
try
the
expedition
d
sweet
and
creamy
i
liked
it
id
say
its
worth
trying
another
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
drinkability
great
seasonal
beer
for
drinking
once
a
year
outside
of
that
this
beer
isnt
something
id
search
out
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
definitely
falling
into
my
regular
rotation
of
brews
a
must
try
for
stout
fans
the
cream
comes
in
the
swallow
surprisingly
theres
no
sourness
that
i
associate
with
the
style
coffee
without
cream
up
front
a
very
easy
to
drink
stoutsmooth
body
and
carbonation
is
accurate
scary
how
think
can
easy
become
a
session
beer
d
easy
drinker
and
great
character
a
must
try
overall
bells
sdcs
is
a
good
stout
for
what
it
is
its
not
going
to
blast
your
taste
buds
but
it
is
sufficiently
complex
to
be
enjoyable
and
could
be
drank
in
earnest
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
and
i
would
happily
have
another
overall
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
its
tasty
and
unique
and
recommend
others
to
try
this
dhard
to
drink
a
pint
of
this
unless
you
like
smokypeppery
style
beers
d
not
nearly
as
imposing
as
i
thought
it
would
be
which
actually
lends
itself
to
drinkability
it
really
is
creamy
pretty
dark
black
with
a
hint
of
ruby
rubytan
head
that
is
about
1
or
so
and
dissapates
quickly
leaving
small
islands
with
a
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
rich
in
malty
overtones
very
sweet
smelling
strong
vanilla
chocolate
and
toffee
flavors
among
the
10
malts
that
are
used
smell
is
excellent
for
a
beer
and
one
of
the
best
points
taste
is
definitely
creamy
and
milky
along
with
the
aforementioned
malts
its
a
delectable
stout
the
finish
is
some
toasted
bitter
coffee
and
kind
of
brings
a
nice
clean
finish
to
the
sweet
malty
beginning
gets
better
with
every
taste
well
brewed
and
crafted
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
i
will
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again

overall
this
is
a
straight

yet
satisfying
stout
that
nails
the
style
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
and
is
a
stout
of
which
i
could
knock
back
a
few
i
really
enjoy
its
pronounced
creaminess
as
well
as
the
nutty
roasted
malts
this
is
definitely
another
winner
from
bells
this
beer
pours
a
dark
dark
black
smell
is
good
but
not
the
best
of
any
stout
mouthfeel
is
impressive
and
you
can
taste
a
multitude
of
flavors
in
each
sip
overall
not
the
best
stout
i
have
had
but
it
is
well
above
average
i
really
enjoy
bells
brews
in
general
and
this
one
didnt
disappoint
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a

the
pour
is

the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
meld
well
it
finishes
with
a
slight
burnt
coffee
the
body
is
medium
well
carbonated
and
i
did
not
feel
like
it
was
exceptionally
creamy

good

a
nice
frothy
khaki
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
great
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
some
mild
roasted

and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
a
wonderfully
smooth
kick
of
roasted
malts
with
nice
subtle
cocoa
that
leaves
a
wonderful
finish
the
beer
is
quite
light
crisp
and
smooth
with
nice
carbonation
this
is
a
great
stout
one
ive
been
overlooking
for
a
few
years
drinkability
a
one
and
done
beer
but
decent
nonetheless
not
one
id
buy
in
the
future
to
be
honest
dthis
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
am
not
disappointed
this
is
not
available
to
me
in
the
pnw
my
sisterinlaw
brought
this
out
from
ohio
when
she
visited
for
christmas
overall
this
is
one
damn
good
stout
all
the
typical
stout
flavors
that
we
know
and
love
are
there
but
they
are
mixed
perfectly
with
sweet
roasted
malts
and
a
super
creamy
mouthfeel
that
really
makes
this
beer
stand
out
from
the
mainstream
bells
broke
the
mold
with
this
one
and
i
hope
they
continue
to
blow
my
mind
with
their
crazy
good
brews
d
drinkability
is
moderate
the
flavors
are
nice
and
balanced
but
as
mentioned
before
dont
pop
out
at
me
its
a
solid
drink
but
nothing
i
would
actively
seek
out
again
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
pitch
black
with
a
half
finger
tan
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cream
and
slight
roasted
malt
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
caramel
roasted
malt
and
cream
on
the
followthrough
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
the
flavor
on
this
one
was
kind
of
watereddown
in
my
opinion
the
aroma
on
this
one
isnt
overly
great
either
but
decent
just
seemed
to
be
lacking
in
intensity
in
both
aspects
with
that
said
however
it
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
i
could
imagine
this
being
mixed
with
expedition
and
being
quite
good
mouthfeel
on
this
one
was
kind
of
thin
as
well
for
my
taste
while
this
helps
the
drinkability
of
the
brew
it
also
hurts
it
overall
d
awesome
mouthfeel
and
complex
malts
make
it
great
thanks
to
cdkrenz
for
this
sample
in
a
secret
santa
exchange
notes
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
is
a
great
stout
very
complex
in
flavor
and
its
relatively
low
abv
makes
it
very
drinkable
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
the
flavor
is
very
similar
like
very
soft
tissue
paper
on
my
bum
it
washes
down
my
palate
with
a
silky
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
it
finishes
very
dry
but
extremely
pleasant
nothing
too
big
and
bold
here
just
a
magnificently
crafted
stout
that
is
as
easy
drinking
as
they
come
poured
from
the
bottle
oil
black
with
an
incredibly
thick
rocky
tan
head
that
took
some
time
to
recede
and
stuck
to
the
side
of
the
glass
with
lacing
smell
is
semi
sweet
chocolate
small
amount
of
coffee
and
roasted
grain
taste
is
sweet
upfront
chocolate
and
sweet
coffee
that
is
followed
with
a
small
hop
bit
and
roasted
grain
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
thick
creamy
great
body
to
this
beer
for
such
a
full
bodied
beer
i
could
always
have
another
one
of
my
winter
time
favorites
the
taste
rich
yet
soft
very
easy
drinking
not
big
on
the
roast
or
chocolate
it
keeps
a
velvet
like
average
chewiness
with
that
dallop
of
cocoa
powder
not
heavy
on
the
sweetness
doesnt
leave
much
of
an
aftertaste
at
all
ends
dry
for
a
milk
stout
or
whatnot
a
little
twang
with
it
this
beer
offers
a
ton
of
different
flavor
profiles
all
under
one
cap
but
none
of
them
are
really
in
your
face
one
of
those
stouts
that
you
can
use
to
convert
someone
to
stouts
but
isnt
overly
simplified
complex
and
enjoyable
enough
for
everyone
big
surprise
i
hadnt
ever
had
this
before
and
it
was
a
really
good
find
definitely
on
my
awesome
list
drinkability
brace
yourself
bells
made
another
wellrounded
quality
stout
hard
to
believe
i
know
all
jokes
aside
this
is
a
damn
fine
american
stout
no
twist
no
gimmicks
just
quality
crafting
would
drink
again
the
flavor
is
big
on
the
lactose
creamy
sweetness
thy
almost
reminds
me
of
ice
cream
there
is
enough
sweet
and
surly
malt
to
balance
the
whole
thing
very
nicely
mouthfeel
is
fantastically
smoky
and
creamy
drinkable
as
well
doesnt
feel
too
heavy
or
boozy
a
dessert
stout
if
you
will
rich
and
complex
a
dry
but
creamy
stout
very
nice
this
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
smells
of
roasted
malts
sweet
malt
almost
like
cream
or
milk
and
a
little
bit
of
a
coffee
smell
to
it
as
well
the
taste
is
smooth
creamy
with
a
roasted
malt
character
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
thick
and
is
drinkable
d
an
easy
drinking
sweet
stout
bells
has
done
well
with
this
one
if
you
like
the
style
as
i
do
its
well
worth
a
try
overall
impression
color
me
confused
the
bottled
version
was
crazy
sweet
but
the
tap
version
is
for
the
style
not
sweet
enough
either
this
beer
is
an
entirely
different
animal
on
tap
or
it
was
mistakenly
served
under
this
label
and
was
in
fact
a
different
beer
altogether
maybe
kalamazoo
its
somewhat
of
a
puzzle
rating
this
serving
its
certainly
enjoyable
yet
fails
to
fully
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
style
awesome
brew
from
bells
what
more
would
you
expect
i
just
bottled
a
milk
stout
that
i
think
will
taste
very
close
to
this
but
less
abv
and
probably
more
carbonation
looks
like
a
pretty
standard
coffee
stout
very
light
chocolate
nose
over
the
maltiness
surprisingly
light
malt
for
a
stout
mellowed
by
cream
flavors
full
smooth
body
with
a
faint
malt
stickiness
in
the
finish
incredibly
light
and
mellow
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
definitely
try
it
out
if
you
can
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
brown
topped
with
over
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
smell
i
found
to
be
slightly
coffee
and
mostly
malted
sugar
with
a
decent
amount
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
pretty
decent
mix
of
vanilla
and
coffee
but
it
wasnt
too
bold
on
either
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
everything
seemed
to
be
in
order
there
was
nothing
outstanding
or
spectacular
about
this
beer
but
it
was
pretty
solid
and
enjoyable
overall
i
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
some
more
of
these
will
revisit
taste
warm
colalike
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
a
buttery
mouthfeel
and
a
drierthananticipated
finish
the
creaminess
here
is
more
in
the
body
and
mouthfeel
and
only
one
of
many
aspects
of
the
taste
there
are
some
low
dark
fruit
notes
in
the
background
of
this
one
and
the
dry
finish
has
a
grainy
coffeelike
feel
im
not
sure
all
the
elements
here
add
up
as
ideally
as
desired
for
me
though
at
least
its
interesting
the
colafeel
contrasts
a
little
strangely
with
the
buttery
cream
notes
and
the
fruit
notes
a
little
strangely
against
the
coffee
finish
its
a
decent
enough
sipper
not
one
id
turn
away
by
any
means
but
its
not
an
absolute
home
run
either
unlike
the
bros
i
noticed
zero
lacing
and
poor
head
retention
in
my
glass
the
feel
of
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
is
smooth
going
down
but
has
a
fierce
character
that
can
jump
out
at
you
at
any
time
damn
good
stuff
i
dont
know
why
i
dont
get
this
stuff
more
often
fine
to
sip
on
a
cold
night
but
not
overly
rememberable
moreys
bottom
line
a
solid
stout
from
a
solid
brewery
theres
no
wow
factor
with
this
beer
though
its
good
but
not
outstanding
its
pretty
easy
drinking
as
far
as
stouts
go
poured
almost
opaque
black
with
one
finger
tan
head
nose
of
a
good
stout
malty
chocolatey
coffee
taste
is
medium
carbonation
and
sweet
malt
start
coffeelike
bitterness
at
the
back
bittersweet
chocolate
and
smoke
in
the
aftertaste
leans
toward
the
taste
of
an
imperial
stout
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
decent
drinkability
drinks
easily
and
while
not
cravable
certainly
a
solid
beer
mouth
feel
as
you
would
expect
is
very
creamy
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
drinkability
is
held
back
slightly
due
to
sweetness
verdict
great
wellmade
stout
that
makes
up
for
its
ubiquitous
nature
by
being
damn
excellent
and
tasty
drink
well
my
friends
absolutely
opaque
black
in
color
a
simple
dark
tan
head
holds
for
several
minutes
and
then
drops
to
a
thin
surface
covering
and
very
nice
collar
the
aroma
reveals
licorice
sweet
milk
chocolate
creamy
coffee
mild
buttery
biscuit
and
a
touch
of
raisin
roasty
an
interesting
fruity
tasty
up
front
becoming
quickly
mildly
sweet
and
creamy
like
a
rich
sour
cream
the
bitterness
deepens
as
the
beer
warms
and
breathes
on
the
palate
there
is
a
touch
of
alcohol
but
it
burns
off
quickly
leaving
a
dry
finish
thats
loaded
with
lingering
bitterness
dry
coffeelike
roastiness
and
a
light
touch
of
mildy
tart
dark
fruitiness
the
body
is
medium
the
texture
is
softly
fluffy
as
the
beer
seems
to
expand
on
the
palate
oily
on
the
finish
drinkability
is
high
because
this
beer
invites
you
back
with
the
promise
of
another
intriguing
sip
one
of
the
best
ive
had
a
very
nice
stout
drinkability
i
really
liked
this
beer
not
a
heap
of
complexity
great
mouthfeel
a
seasonable
cream
stout
to
say
the
least
my
first
bells
offering
and
certainly
not
the
last
a
very
nice
beer
to
sip
on
and
savor
the
thickness
makes
it
kinda
of
weird
to
down
one
after
another
d
i
am
sure
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
just
maybe
not
all
in
one
sitting
a
very
nice
cask
offering
from
bells
id
love
to
say
im
more
impressed
but
i
suppose
im
not
just
seems
like
another
run
of
the
mill
stout
to
me
not
really
sweet
at
all
per
style
and
kind
of
thin
nice
beer
d
very
easy
drinking
milk
stout
is
my
preferred
type
of
stout
next
to
imperial
this
is
really
well
balanced
and
easy
to
put
down
i
like
the
chocolate
flavors
in
this
d
highly
drinkable
stout
that
could
be
easily
sessionable
overall
a
tasty
beer
it
is
a
tad
overcarbonated
but
the
flavours
are
strong
and
rich
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
moloko
plus
but
it
is
still
an
exceptional
brew
from
bells
this
pours
black
with
a
nice
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
with
good
lacing
on
the
nose
the
main
note
is
caramel
with
some
chocolate
and
raw
sugar
in
the
back
on
the
tongue
its
the
same
idea
as
the
nose
and
towards
the
back
there
is
a
good
deal
of
sweetness
in
the
mouth
its
not
especially
thick
but
there
is
the
cloying
quality
that
often
comes
with
these
sweeter
beers
its
plenty
drinkable
as
long
as
sweet
stouts
dont
turn
you
off
overall
overall
the
beer
was
very
nice
im
a
big
fan
of
the
sweet
stouts
so
i
wasnt
disappointed
when
i
tried
this
one
the
flavor
is
complex
and
goes
through
phases
of
sweetness
and
finishes
with
a
nice
bitter
flavor
well
done
id
recommend
this
to
all
beer
drinkers
d
a
light
body
with
good
taste
make
this
a
pretty
good
choice
if
i
wanted
something
creamy
and
roasty
i
could
definitely
knock
a
couple
of
these
back
but
would
probably
pick
another
stout
if
it
was
available
however
this
would
be
wonderful
withas
dessert
so
my
percentage
of
ordering
it
would
increase
exponentially
after
a
meal
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
creamy
unforgiving
tan
head
with
tons
of
residual
lacing
smells
of
coffee
and
some
chocolate
and
maybe
roasted
malts
tastes
of
tons
of
coffee
with
tasty
sweetness
and
roasted
malts
hops
round
out
the
flavor
and
cut
some
of
the
sweetness
you
can
taste
some
chocolate
in
there
as
well
nice
thick
and
full
bodied
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
really
good
overall
good
beer
overall
not
my
favorite
stout
but
its
worth
a
try
d
i
could
drink
these
all
night
tastes
great
and
goes
down
smooth
exceptional
cream
stout
well
done
im
a
fan
of
sweet
stouts
and
this
is
a
very
good
one
ill
certainly
get
it
again
i
have
sampled
this
many
times
over
the
last
five
or
six
yearshad
on
tap
today
the
mellow
mushroom
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
jet
black
with
a
creamy
one
finger
mocha
colored
headit
just
looked
rich
from
the
tap
bitter
chocolate
and
cookie
dough
aromas
really
stood
out
with
a
bit
of
char
thrown
in
there
as
well
flavors
are
highly
roasted
and
coffeelike
upfront
with
some
char
again
as
wellsome
cookie
and
molasses
sweetness
comes
in
late
in
a
nice
finish
a
well
rounded
solid
stoutit
wont
blow
you
away
but
its
got
a
nice
balanced
flavor
profile
not
bad
this
one
is
a
decent
stout
i
think
the
cream
could
come
through
a
little
more
but
for
what
it
is
this
one
isnt
shabby
at
all
if
they
could
fix
the
roast
on
the
finish
i
think
this
one
would
be
a
go
to
for
me
d
another
solid
stout
from
bells
especially
for
those
with
a
sweet
tooth
would
go
best
with
dessert
d
if
milk
stouts
are
your
thing
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
still
hold
fff
moloko
up
on
a
pedestal
in
this
regard
because
of
its
complex
cinnamonlike
quality
but
this
is
still
a
very
worthy
entry
into
this
fantastic
style
pours
black
with
a
hint
of
brown
at
the
edges
the
head
is
a
medium
brown
color
and
sticks
around
through
most
of
this
beer
aroma
is
of
dark
roated
grains
coffee
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
very
enjoyable
this
is
one
complex
but
well
integrated
beer
it
is
not
sweet
at
all
for
a
milk
stout
but
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
common
for
the
style
overall
i
would
say
the
taste
is
pretty
dry
flavor
of
dark
roasted
grains
and
coffee
some
slight
chocolate
and
vanilla
notes
are
present
there
is
also
a
slightly
hoppy
note
at
the
end
of
the
sip
mouthfeel
is
fairly
heavy
and
appropriate
for
the
style
bells
really
knows
how
to
do
stouts
well
and
this
is
another
great
example
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
color
with
1
finger
of
creamy
tan
head
leaving
some
slight
lacing
not
a
whole
lot
in
the
smell
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
is
about
it
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
but
there
is
also
some
tartness
to
this
stout
maybe
some
dark
fruits
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
just
cant
get
over
the
tartness
of
this
sweet
stout
this
is
my
2nd
time
giving
this
bells
offering
a
chance
and
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
again
unfortunately
definitely
prefer
their
other
stouts
overall
well
balanced
enjoyable
sweet
stout
i
am
editing
my
rating
on
this
beer
i
still
love
the
flavor
of
this
beer
but
i
recently
purchace
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
and
found
that
after
a
couple
of
beers
that
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
was
a
little
overwhelming
changing
my
drinkability
from
5
to
4
d
the
bitter
and
sweet
balance
make
this
a
drinkability
winner
received
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
trade
pours
a
jet
black
color
shot
through
with
ruby
highlights
and
capped
off
with
a
medium
brown
head
aromas
of
chocolate
caramel
vanilla
and
heavy
cream
flavors
of
bitter
burnt
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
milk
creamy
and
full
bodied
but
not
for
me
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
mingling
of
flavors
but
overall
a
good
beer
indeed
serving
in
bottle
i
poured
into
chilled
pint
glass
i
should
have
made
it
colder
before
drinking
drinkability
no
question
this
one
is
double
creamtastic
and
goes
down
easy
three
bottles
were
harmed
in
the
writing
of
this
review
d
i
think
the
abv
being
lower
than
some
of
the
big
stouts
helps
its
sustained
drinkability
separate
from
that
its
not
quite
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
cream
stout
lacks
an
overall
uh
creaminess
d
i
wish
i
could
have
one
of
these
every
day
very
delicious
we
have
a
hver
hot
fall
season
and
this
is
the
perfect
stout
to
make
the
transistion
to
the
heavier
beers
dgood
winter
session
beer
notes
after
tasting
enjoyed
this
with
strawberries
and
dark
chocolate
truffles
for
dessert
perfect
pairing
in
my
opinion
this
is
about
as
tasty
as
it
gets
for
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
midnight
black
color
with
a
monstrous
light
chocolate
head
that
creamy
in
its
consistency
and
the
left
over
lace
a
fine
satiny
sheet
to
meld
with
the
glass
rich
chocolate
malt
sweet
nose
coffee
roasted
grain
and
just
a
treasure
to
sniff
front
is
ambrosial
full
and
rich
as
is
the
full
bodied
top
finish
is
bittersweet
mildly
acidic
bone
dry
and
a
real
pleasing
beer
notes
a
nice
sweet
stout
with
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
keeps
the
sweetness
in
check
a
little
on
the
thin
side
and
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
number
of
these
in
a
night
but
it
was
definitely
a
nice
treat
d
quite
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
23
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
really
love
this
beer
definitely
my
favorite
milk
stout
oh
and
the
label
is
cool
too
this
stout
is
deliciously
simple
i
really
could
drink
it
all
night
it
is
creamy
and
a
touch
of
sweet
balanced
by
a
touch
of
roast
and
bitterness
drinks
like
confusion
not
creamy
enough
and
a
little
too
tangy
double
cream
stout
isnt
one
ill
be
seeking
out
again
had
this
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
black
with
some
brown
highlights
and
a
super
creamy
offwhite
head
with
excellent
lacing
smells
nutty
and
lightly
roasty
with
some
creaminess
tastes
delicious
creamy
and
slightly
sweet
with
a
fresh
cream
citrus
hop
and
a
light
roasty
flavor
and
some
toasted
hazlenut
and
almonds
creamy
and
with
some
sweetness
in
the
mouth
a
very
nice
beer
d
this
is
one
easydrinking
double
cream
stout
full
bodied
creamy
and
rich
yet
finishes
clean
and
without
a
heavy
lingering
aftertaste
m
very
nice
smooth
finish
but
bitter
taste
was
a
bit
overwhelming
the
creamy
texture
is
probably
the
best
part
of
this
beer
edit
tried
a
bottle
of
batch
10151
aka
012511
on
82711
and
theres
no
acidity
at
all
just
smooth
and
creamy
score
for
taste
and
mouthfeel
reflect
this
bottle
d
overall
way
more
bitter
than
i
had
hoped
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
i
need
to
stop
having
pre
concieved
notions
about
the
beers
i
drink
d
if
i
could
find
this
often
id
be
drinking
it
often
a
good
stout
that
everyone
should
try
this
is
my
favorite
milkcream
stout
m
mediumheavy
body
this
feels
like
milk
in
your
mouth
and
beckons
me
to
eat
it
with
ice
cream
a
bowl
of
vanilla
and
a
pint
of
this
make
a
great
pair
i
really
enjoy
one
of
these
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
1
in
a
night
its
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
d
extremely
drinkable
this
definitely
wouldnt
be
a
session
beer
but
theres
so
much
going
on
with
it
that
you
just
have
to
constantly
go
back
for
more
to
see
what
the
next
sip
will
bring
welcome
to
the
embodification
is
that
even
a
word
of
twoface
this
dark
and
edgy
beer
seems
to
have
a
dual
nature
in
many
ways
the
finish
is
both
clean
and
dirty
the
flavors
are
both
bitter
and
sweet
the
nose
mirrors
its
flavors
as
both
bitter
and
sweet
it
is
not
like
these
two
are
one
and
the
same
either
it
is
not
bittersweet
but
two
unique
personas
i
would
drink
this
beer
every
night
of
the
week
it
has
so
little
of
an
alcohol
punch
that
i
couldnt
even
note
it
anywhere
minus
the
very
beginning
i
loved
it
bells
cream
stout
poured
black
with
a
small
tan
head
it
smelt
sweet
with
choclate
it
tasted
very
sweet
and
a
bit
harsh
on
the
palette
it
had
strong
flavors
and
wasnt
the
easist
to
drink
overall
different
and
not
bad
but
not
the
best
iam
sure
i
would
get
this
one
again
bells
other
stouts
are
much
better
pours
a
deep
dark
rich
black
color
with
a
huge
huge
foamy
head
that
almost
went
over
the
glass
smell
is
really
bitter
dark
chocolate
sour
cherries
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
powder
taste
is
way
off
i
think
its
infected
really
has
a
bitter
tart
sour
cherry
flavor
goign
on
has
nothing
like
a
cream
stout
should
have
going
on
really
this
might
be
infected
otherwise
its
just
not
good
mouthfeel
is
decent
a
bit
over
carbonated
for
my
liking
on
a
stout
drinkability
is
average
despite
the
sourness
in
this
beer
i
will
have
to
get
another
sample
just
to
verify
if
this
is
what
the
beer
is
really
like
d
the
acidity
and
oxidation
make
this
undrinkable
beer
is
medium
body
the
roast
is
in
the
aftertaste
only
the
forward
is
moderately
thin
in
flavor
with
some
sweetness
followed
by
the
burned
sugar
taste
its
a
little
tangy
too
interesting
but
im
not
super
impressed
it
tastes
fine
but
ive
had
better
stouts
o
buy
again
definitely
recommend
highly
search
out
yes
worth
the
price
for
the
alcohol
and
strength
of
flavor
yes
something
like
a
dollar
fifty
a
bottle
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
considering
the
great
balance
another
great
beer
from
bells
but
this
falls
short
of
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
a
cream
stout
black
with
barely
noticeable
brown
tint
dense
medium
sized
head
smells
soothingly
roasty
with
light
espresso
and
chocolate
a
big
and
creamy
mouthfeel
the
beer
tastes
buttery
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
lactic
sweetness
balanced
by
roasted
dryness
and
bitter
chocolate
very
low
hop
the
beer
is
tremendously
satisfying
well
balanced
and
gives
me
a
nourished
feeling
every
time
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
drinkability
this
beer
isnt
necessarily
bad
it
just
lacks
a
balance
between
sweetness
and
roastiness
i
will
definitely
enjoy
the
sixer
i
bought
and
have
no
problem
grabbing
one
of
these
if
its
available
or
at
a
party
however
i
think
ill
stick
with
the
cream
stout
when
looking
for
a
sweet
creamy
alternative
to
the
big
stouts
d
pretty
drinkable
for
the
most
part
d
a
below
average
beer
disappointing
didnt
expect
vinegar
im
pretty
disappointed
because
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
and
i
cant
get
it
in
my
hometown
oh
well
d
not
bad
its
a
lighter
stout
definitely
different
prominent
tastes
in
this
stout
not
really
what
i
go
for
d
for
being
a
sweet
stout
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
was
a
lot
better
than
their
expedition
stout
the
cream
never
became
overly
sweet
and
the
malts
really
lasted
throughout
another
solid
beer
from
bells
a
nicely
drinkable
stout
although
more
suited
for
colder
weather
perhaps
if
it
ever
makes
it
to
tucson
i
will
probably
pick
up
a
sixer
come
winter
time

good
mouthfeel
comments
i
am
a
big
fan
of
bells
brewery
and
i
also
really
enjoy
the
milk
stout
style
accordingly
it
is
no
surprise
that
this
beer
impresses
me
as
my
review
indicates
balance
is
key
with
this
one
d
this
seems
pretty
solid
but
im
not
wellversed
in
the
milk
stout
style
so
i
cant
judge
it
all
that
well
certainly
id
revisit
this
one
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
am
from
kalamazoo
and
this
beer
has
never
disappointed
it
has
a
big
creamy
ambercolored
head
and
an
even
creamier
mouthfeel
in
fact
i
would
say
that
this
is
the
creamiest
mouthfeel
i
have
ever
had
in
a
beer
it
pours
very
dark
brown
going
in
and
looks
nearly
black
in
the
stout
glass
it
has
a
complex
taste
that
finishes
just
a
little
bit
tart
with
a
definite
black
patent
aftertaste
this
bottle
has
the
code
9446
on
the
back
the
label
has
changed
from
red
lettering
to
tan
lettering
outlined
in
black
d
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
which
at
6
is
high
for
a
nonimperial
stout
is
not
noticeable
at
all
it
tastes
like
well
it
tastes
like
that
awesomeness
you
get
from
a
good
stout
its
like
guinness
but
with
a
lot
more
flavor
di
thought
this
beer
was
good
but
not
great
definitely
worth
getting
again
though
as
i
think
its
the
type
that
grows
on
you
imo
d
a
rare
miss
by
bells
with
a
6
1
abv
im
not
sure
cellaring
would
have
made
any
improvements
but
i
cant
help
but
wonder
if
i
drank
this
one
a
little
too
early
acquired
from
a
pa
store
nice
dark
black
pour
tanmocha
1
cm
head
good
retention
smells
like
sour
milk
coffee
and
chocolate
initially
tastes
like
sour
milk
then
i
am
getting
some
hop
bitterness
followed
by
roasted
malts
tastes
mostly
like
coffee
has
a
slick
mouthfeel
i
might
be
wrong
but
i
thought
this
was
supposed
to
sweet
d
a
great
start
but
the
richness
of
the
malts
makes
it
difficult
to
drink
this
for
too
long
all
in
all
though
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
bells
this
one
really
sounded
like
it
would
be
good
i
guess
you
cant
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
or
hundreds
of
good
reviews
i
dont
think
there
was
anything
wrong
with
the
beer
in
the
way
of
spoilage
or
oxidation
but
i
dont
understand
where
some
people
are
coming
from
in
their
reviews
if
i
ever
come
across
it
again
i
will
have
to
try
it
and
see
no
bitterness
to
note
maltiness
is
way
up
front
i
should
note
that
the
longer
this
one
lived
in
the
glass
and
the
closer
it
came
to
room
temp
the
more
enjoyable
it
became
i
thought
this
was
smoother
and
maybe
a
little
more
fullbodied
on
draft
still
enjoyable
and
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
regularly
available
out
there
d
as
ive
said
the
taste
on
this
improves
the
more
you
drink
which
is
a
great
inducement
to
drink
even
more
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
it
doesnt
knock
my
socks
off
its
definitely
worth
trying
but
there
are
other
milk
stouts
which
id
rather
drink
for
the
lake
louie
left
hand
come
to
mind
thats
not
to
say
that
i
wouldnt
love
to
try
black
note
i
can
see
this
pairing
nicely
with
the
expedition
stout
and
bourbon
barrel
aging
would
certainly
add
a
lot
obviously
it
didnt
meet
my
expectations
but
it
was
still
a
good
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
spend
a
night
drinking
these
drinkability
if
you
like
the
style
it
fits
though
maybe
at
a
more
intense
level
and
you
could
have
a
couple
of
these
easily
enough
at
6
1
abv
it
seems
like
something
that
i
would
like
given
its
a
stout
and
sweet
but
1
is
definitely
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
least
was
the
peculiar
tangy
sourness
in
the
middle
d
this
is
not
very
good
to
me
i
am
pretty
sure
this
is
a
fresh
bottle
given
the
batch
number
but
this
is
like
carbonated
slightly
sour
milks
with
coffee
and
carbonation
i
think
i
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
d
its
a
one
glass
drink
for
me
makes
for
a
good
dessert
brew
but
doesnt
draw
me
in
d
a
really
solid
example
of
the
style
recommended
very
drinkable
stout
not
too
complex
and
very
smooth
nice
touch
in
not
killing
it
with
a
high
abv
great
ballance
on
this
one
again
if
it
wasnt
for
the
metallis
bite
this
one
would
be
a
bit
better
still
its
very
drinkable
and
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
d
great
balance
of
sweet
and
smokey
with
a
smooth
body
its
an
easy
drinker
full
of
flavor
without
being
too
big
at
all
the
sweet
comes
from
both
the
fruit
and
the
milk
balancing
the
acidity
on
that
end
as
well
really
pleasant
overall
impression
this
is
a
very
mellow
sweet
stout
i
really
liked
the
chocolate
finish
it
was
better
previously
at
the
pope
on
cask
but
that
goes
without
saying
i
never
actually
smelled
milk
in
a
beer
before
and
ive
had
many
milksweet
stouts
over
the
years
regardless
i
still
liked
it
this
beer
really
did
not
come
to
life
until
it
warmed
up
more
so
than
most
other
fine
ales
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
big
roasty
malts
a
smooth
body
and
tangy
milkiness
i
like
sour
beers
but
im
not
sure
if
this
pairing
is
really
my
thing
i
think
bells
has
done
a
good
job
with
the
style
and
if
i
had
a
fresher
bottle
maybe
i
wouldnt
notice
the
lactic
sourness
as
much
all
in
all
though
this
is
still
a
tasty
beer
and
one
that
id
like
to
try
again
overall
its
interesting
i
dont
know
if
so
much
milk
is
my
thing
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
must
have
had
my
first
bottle
of
double
cream
stout
a
little
too
cold
but
served
at
cellar
temps
this
beer
is
extremely
welldone
a
wonderful
aroma
and
flavorful
taste
make
this
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
in
a
while
d
good
stuff
but
not
as
mind
boggling
as
some
other
bells
brews
two
hearted
anyone
i
tried
this
at
the
good
beer
spot
in
town
and
it
may
have
been
a
little
to
chilled
id
like
to
savor
this
in
a
snifter
at
room
temp
at
home
and
give
it
another
go
d
exceptional
a
very
well
made
beer
5
0
d
this
is
a
very
odd
beer
the
aroma
is
quite
subdued
but
the
flavor
is
robust
just
not
in
a
good
way
this
may
be
because
the
primary
flavor
component
is
sticky
cloying
sweetness
this
excessive
sweetness
is
accompanied
by
an
odd
cola
like
note
of
artificial
caramel
flavoring
and
some
strange
sourness
the
only
thing
i
can
find
to
like
about
it
is
the
pleasant
dark
roasted
coffee
note
that
is
always
lingering
in
the
background
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
beer
it
is
strange
one
dimensional
and
overly
sweet
and
i
definitely
wont
be
drinking
it
again
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
it
real
fast
or
drinking
too
many
of
these
at
once
but
it
is
working
pretty
good
as
my
desert
beer
of
the
night
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
overall
a
good
brew
this
was
my
first
milk
stout
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
another
overall
this
i
a
very
nice
stout
that
tastes
as
the
label
states
the
sweetness
makes
it
very
drinkable
double
cream
is
not
too
strong
and
quite
easy
to
drink
its
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
a
double
cream
stout
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
smells
strong
and
robust
very
tart
yogurt
like
aromas
the
taste
is
very
tart
and
sour
but
i
like
it
mouthfeel
isnt
very
stouty
but
you
can
actually
taste
some
cream
like
qualities
very
interesting
d
not
something
to
daisy
chain
together
for
sure
but
too
good
not
to
finish
this
is
somewhere
between
a
sipper
and
a
dessert
beer
terrific
exceedingly
easy
drink
and
goes
down
very
fast
d
maybe
i
just
dont
enjoy
this
style
very
much
but
this
one
just
doesnt
hold
up
very
well
for
me
the
flavors
are
there
but
fall
off
very
quickly
succumbing
to
an
unappealing
mouthfeel
i
was
contemplating
pouring
this
for
a
bit
before
i
decided
to
suck
it
up
not
an
awful
beer
just
not
for
me
j
mda
little
on
the
thin
side
for
a
stout
of
this
abv
for
me
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
a
little
more
here
very
drinkable
though
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
get
my
hands
on
this
in
ct
d
this
is
a
very
good
offering
from
bells
its
a
shame
i
so
seldom
see
it
i
would
drink
it
more
often
3
54444
serving
type
ontap
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
but
sits
a
bit
heavy
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
two
bottles
pours
a
dark
chocolaty
color
with
littlel
head
and
minimal
lacing
it
has
a
great
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
chocolatey
smell
that
surpasses
the
taste
and
drinkability
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
co2
for
a
stout
but
it
does
not
really
stand
out
as
a
stout
that
separates
itself
from
the
rest
dvery
drinkable
a
perfect
balance
of
bitter
like
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
and
the
sweetness
of
lactose
a
very
nice
balanced
sweet
stout
that
can
definately
be
enjoyed
throughout
the
night
drinkability
a
solid
stout
and
i
would
drink
again
seemed
sessionable
and
not
too
double
as
stated
on
the
label
very
much
just
like
anormal
milk
stout
very
good
though
i
would
probably
try
this
again
but
stouts
are
not
really
my
thing
for
what
it
was
though
i
thought
it
was
a
good
beer
and
something
id
recommend
to
anyone
into
that
style
overall
a
decent
stout
carbonation
plays
in
well
with
the
flavors
and
helps
to
balance
things
out
on
the
palate
a
good
example
of
a
finely
crafted
cream
stout
another
winner
from
bells
why
is
this
available
in
florida
but
not
colorado
i
looked
forward
to
finally
trying
this
one
it
wasnt
quite
as
good
as
i
hoped
but
it
certainly
is
another
respectable
offering
from
bells
great
texture
to
the
beer
creamy
and
not
too
heavy
the
flavors
are
exactly
what
i
like
in
a
milk
stout
with
emphasis
on
the
creaminess
and
overall
sweet
character
just
an
awesome
milk
stout
imo
the
aroma
flavor
in
this
one
for
me
if
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
it
would
be
an
easy
4
as
it
is
i
prefer
bells
kalamazoo
stout
which
is
also
cheaper
than
this
double
cream
stout
odd
duck
seems
to
vary
a
little
in
its
characteristics
this
time
i
dont
think
im
imagining
it
and
dont
know
how
it
could
be
possible
but
it
seems
to
me
like
the
cream
qualities
i
e
the
lactose
is
spoiled
i
pick
up
some
sour
milk
aroma
and
flavor
other
than
that
part
the
flavor
is
spot
on
and
ditto
aroma
body
is
creamy
and
is
for
me
one
of
my
favorite
kinds
of
beer
milkcream
stout
so
easy
drinking
dont
pick
up
any
alcohol
in
this
at
all
so
its
a
sneaky
one
carbonation
is
perfect
head
is
tan
fine
and
medium
size
nice
lace
id
give
it
much
better
rating
except
for
the
sour
thing
and
admittadly
my
sensory
apparatus
is
defective
soooo
i
leave
it
there
the
brew
looked
great
in
the
glass
the
smell
was
great
very
full
and
it
draws
you
in
the
flavor
is
a
bit
odd
the
first
mouthful
i
actually
did
not
like
it
was
a
little
like
an
odd
cheese
but
after
that
i
really
liked
it
i
wished
that
i
had
more
than
one
bottle
i
do
think
that
i
could
drink
this
for
a
full
evening
drinkability
i
have
been
seeking
out
rare
one
ofs
much
less
lately
and
just
grabbing
a
six
pack
here
and
there
it
is
nice
to
relax
and
have
some
solid
well
produced
craft
beer
without
breaking
the
bank
or
feeling
the
need
to
review
definitely
a
hit
some
hoppy
bitterness
in
flavors
and
finish
all
around
pretty
average
pours
a
very
dark
brown
to
near
black
that
allows
some
light
to
pass
head
is
light
tan
and
the
nose
has
a
caramelcream
sweet
aroma
to
it
roasty
flavors
are
noted
up
front
on
the
palate
as
it
moves
towards
some
general
malt
sweetness
some
traits
from
the
milk
components
and
a
sweet
to
somewhat
tart
finish
d
very
easy
to
drink
its
quite
tasty
definitely
worth
a
shot
id
love
to
run
across
this
on
draft
pleasant
easy
to
drink
stout
with
a
good
full
mouthfeel
nice
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
black
with
some
brownred
highlights
the
head
is
a
wetsandy
color
and
manages
to
stick
around
for
a
while
nice
roasted
malt
aroma
with
a
delicate
vanilla
sweetness
roasted
coffee
flavors
thats
countered
by
a
nice
creamy
vanilla
flavor
the
sweetness
is
more
restrained
than
some
other
milk
stouts
ive
had
but
still
very
nice
perhaps
more
of
a
compromise
for
those
who
dont
like
superdry
or
supersweet
this
one
lands
squarely
in
the
middle
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
theres
still
a
pleasant
carbonated
quality
that
lifts
the
sweetness
of
the
palate
there
may
be
better
milk
stouts
out
there
but
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
and
has
great
balance
to
it
overall
another
impressive
brew
from
bells
and
another
solid
bottle
from
ottovon
o
the
perfect
pint
of
guinness
happens
to
be
bells
special
double
cream
stout
drink
this
one
as
fresh
as
possible
as
this
one
is
already
smooth
and
its
flavors
are
already
on
their
way
out
drinkability
not
a
scary
abv
here
to
contend
with
so
i
say
drink
away
as
im
doing
very
easy
drinker
a
16
ounce
draft
good
foamy
head
mocha
in
color
little
lacing
looks
black
in
color
with
the
carbonation
making
very
pretty
lines
on
the
glass
deep
mocha
smell
the
heavy
but
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
i
was
hoping
for
strong
malts
with
a
bitter
sweet
end
nice
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
i
had
4
of
them
before
i
knew
it
and
had
to
slow
down
a
bit
could
easily
have
finished
off
the
sixer
d
definitely
drinkable
the
creaminess
of
it
makes
it
worth
drinking
for
sure
a
recommendation
to
any
fan
of
stouts
d
just
a
trial
beer
for
me
i
wouldnt
get
this
in
a
sixer
or
anything
for
not
being
an
imperial
stout
this
one
holds
its
own
surprisingly
well
a
nice
winter
warmer
indeed
d
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
milk
stout
at
first
it
tasted
strong
of
coffee
to
me
but
i
definitely
thought
it
improved
as
i
drank
it
and
began
to
taste
the
cream
flavor
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
dark
black
color
with
a
2
finger
tan
head
with
large
bubbles
and
decent
retention
smells
of
dark
roasted
coffee
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
the
same
the
bitter
coffee
and
the
sweet
malt
balance
each
other
out
there
is
also
some
vanilla
flavor
present
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
and
has
a
sweet
sticky
aftertaste
a
nice
drinkable
beer
which
i
would
buy
again
d
im
a
bit
conflicted
on
this
one
i
love
sweeter
lactic
stouts
and
this
definitely
fits
the
bill
the
bittersweet
aftertaste
tasty
as
it
is
seems
a
bit
oafish
and
slightly
overstays
its
welcome
id
say
this
beer
may
be
a
victim
of
its
own
hype
i
routinely
see
this
selling
for
15sixer
i
expected
something
excellent
but
this
falls
just
short
of
that
d
an
easy
to
drink
version
of
a
milk
stout
very
mild
flavor
but
very
sticky
and
for
no
reason
the
flavor
is
muted
but
still
very
decent
a
solid
example
of
the
style
one
not
readily
brewed
right
now
on
the
west
coast
d
certainly
drinkabletwo
or
three
in
a
row
is
not
out
of
my
range
light
enough
to
drink
three
with
enough
taste
and
texture
to
keep
your
buds
entertained
enjoyed
this
one
with
strawberries
and
a
70
coco
chocolate
bar
the
beer
was
simply
perfect
and
with
these
could
have
drank
all
six
but
ate
up
all
my
strawberries
and
chocolate
so
decided
to
save
the
rest
talk
about
harmony
with
food
wow
wine
cant
hang
with
this
combo
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
khaki
head
the
aroma
is
awesome
smells
like
a
mochaccino
along
with
some
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
very
creamy
with
coffee
and
roasted
malts
the
aftertaste
is
dominated
by
the
coffee
and
you
get
some
good
bitterness
from
that
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
low
carbonation
drinkability
bells
is
the
king
of
stouts
and
this
is
another
winner
wish
i
bought
two
sixpacks
and
wish
this
was
here
love
the
combo
of
toasted
and
burnt
malts
an
excellent
milk
stout
to
rival
left
hand
abv
is
low
enough
to
have
a
few
but
the
syrupy
richness
and
the
inyourface
chocolate
cake
flavor
may
make
this
a
one
and
done
affair
doble
cream
is
a
very
very
dark
brown
that
might
as
well
be
called
black
it
practically
is
a
nice
semi
full
off
white
vanilla
head
stayed
a
float
but
did
not
manage
to
leave
any
lace
smell
up
front
is
dark
malt
and
chocolate
warming
up
some
of
vanilla
creeps
in
with
toasted
nuts
further
warming
reveals
coffee
beans
the
taste
is
pretty
much
in
the
same
order
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
but
the
cream
seems
to
be
lacking
a
lot
of
coffee
with
warming
that
i
was
not
expecting
i
dont
see
why
they
call
this
a
double
the
feel
is
a
bumpy
ride
and
a
bit
rugged
not
as
easy
going
down
as
others
in
the
style
perhaps
this
would
be
best
off
a
nitro
hopefully
one
day
ill
find
it
bells
needs
to
take
double
out
of
the
name
or
add
double
the
amount
of
cream
next
batch
but
all
is
not
lost
with
this
specialty
bells
stout
malts
are
super
toasty
and
dark
practically
begging
to
be
followed
with
a
fat
chunk
of
chocolate
or
maybe
a
chocolate
covered
espresso
bean
and
hey
with
such
a
beautiful
malty
finish
i
think
the
puny
sweetness
is
a
blessing
in
disguise
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
fairly
thin
tan
head
that
sits
that
settles
atop
you
can
smell
the
creamy
milk
characteristics
of
this
beer
very
refreshing
smell
with
some
hints
of
roasted
coffee
beans
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
with
some
added
taste
of
coffee
and
the
milkcream
really
dominate
the
quaff
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
while
refreshing
very
solid
milk
stout
alcohol
is
masked
really
well
by
the
complexity
and
sweetness
of
the
taste
very
sessionable
in
my
opinion
drinkability
i
give
it
a
4
very
nice
flavors
that
are
robust
solid
mouthfeel
and
smell
and
a
moderate
abv
would
be
very
nice
for
a
cool
night
poured
into
a
pint
glass
black
with
a
1
finger
mocha
head
that
dissolved
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
thin
lacing
smelled
of
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
the
taste
followed
the
nose
and
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
with
a
hint
of
mocha
and
a
hops
aftertaste
that
was
far
from
overpowering
but
balanced
the
beer
just
fine
moderate
carbonation
this
is
about
as
drinkable
of
a
beer
as
ive
had
i
would
be
more
than
happy
having
a
few
more
it
was
creamy
and
silky
as
it
should
be
with
a
very
low
astringency
very
drinkable
and
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
that
isnt
over
the
top
creamy
and
cloying
big
aggressive
head
of
dark
tan
lots
of
dense
foam
yet
offers
a
host
of
large
bubbles
as
well
excellent
retention
and
strong
lacing
as
well
onyx
black
in
color
actually
black
is
not
a
color
so
more
or
less
colorless
the
nose
has
a
dryness
to
it
which
controls
the
sweeter
qualities
of
the
dark
chocolate
cocoa
licorice
accents
the
cherry
plum
scents
show
good
contour
some
scone
or
flaky
dough
notes
nothing
overtly
hoppy
but
one
assumes
they
contribute
to
the
dryness
fullbodied
the
creamy
texture
relieves
much
of
the
weight
as
well
as
a
good
bit
of
bitterness
still
the
dark
chocolate
coffee
bean
cocoa
powder
has
some
bitterness
licorice
orange
peel
tea
leaves
nuts
drift
in
and
out
lower
level
of
cherry
apricot
apple
fruit
subtle
the
carbonation
is
itself
smooth
but
has
a
relentless
power
to
it
adds
to
a
sense
of
movement
very
consistent
balanced
presentation
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
though
not
as
big
and
bold
as
i
was
expecting
looks
good
and
feels
good
with
a
nice
combination
of
flavors
that
make
for
an
easy
sipping
stout
f
finishes
semi
bitter
but
not
from
hops
just
a
good
old
fashion
bitter
earthy
starched
charred
malts
after
chewing
on
it
for
a
while
it
goes
down
the
hatch
not
so
easily
it
leaves
a
few
layers
on
the
mouth
when
its
gone
leaving
the
chocolate
roast
and
malty
flavors
to
dwell
on
some
light
syrupy
flavors
almost
molasses
its
not
really
dry
but
not
really
sweet
either
on
the
finish
pretty
neutral
and
surprisingly
drinkable
for
the
weight
d
exelent
can
go
for
many
of
this
gems
d
great
for
a
milk
stout
not
really
a
session
style
imho
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
clean
and
light
drinkable
tasty
beer
poured
into
a
dfh
snifter
opaque
black
as
with
most
stouts
very
little
head
and
lacing
it
has
a
very
pleasant
aroma
of
toffee
caramel
roasted
malts
and
coffee
it
is
very
light
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
the
coffee
and
roasted
malts
flavors
coming
to
the
forefront
it
goes
down
really
smooth
with
a
slight
aftertaste
of
the
chocolate
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
and
it
is
definitely
a
brew
that
i
will
seek
out
when
it
comes
around
again
a
great
stout
to
start
out
the
evening
very
drinkable
and
not
too
overpowering
overall
i
expected
sort
of
a
milk
stout
but
got
more
of
a
peppery
magic
hat
howl
with
a
smoother
body
would
buy
again
a
nice
brew
but
nothing
too
interesting
duck
rabbit
remains
my
favorite
milk
stout
md
as
stated
before
creamy
and
smooth
especially
towards
the
back
of
the
palate
the
consistency
is
light
to
medium
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
despite
the
completely
flat
pour
to
add
texture
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
but
this
beer
is
just
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
more
than
one
of
its
a
good
every
once
in
a
while
beer
but
not
a
goto
d
drinks
well
nicely
drinkable
and
unassuming
for
a
stout
one
to
enjoy
on
a
sunday
afternoon
next
review
jet
black
admits
no
light
medium
tan
head
disappears
quickly
leaves
nice
lacing
aroma
of
cafe
au
lait
with
burnt
edges
taste
begins
with
chocolate
then
progresses
to
roasted
coffee
beans
then
finally
to
burnt
espresso
very
nice
indeed
laid
down
6
bottles
tonight
hopefully
i
can
wait
a
year
not
as
heavy
as
you
would
think
ok
so
its
not
a
traditional
milk
stout
due
to
the
roast
and
lack
of
super
sweet
lactose
in
the
flavor
but
this
is
a
damn
good
and
its
towards
the
top
of
the
abv
range
so
im
sure
the
roast
is
necessary
to
avoid
this
tasting
too
hot
a
great
offering
from
bells
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
if
youre
looking
for
something
sweeter
out
of
a
stout
very
smooth
on
the
palate
showing
the
roasted
malt
up
front
but
not
exactly
showcasing
it
turns
toward
burnt
caramel
and
bitter
chocolate
in
the
middle
before
rounding
out
and
fading
into
a
long
smooth
finish
mouthfeel
is
again
smooth
but
lacks
the
body
for
me
to
consider
it
exactly
creamy
very
quaffable
and
were
it
not
for
the
alcohol
content
would
be
a
great
session
beer
indeed
if
it
were
up
to
me
id
leave
a
few
more
fermentable
sugars
in
this
brew
thickening
the
mouthfeel
while
dropping
the
abv
a
very
good
beer
regardless
d
this
is
also
distinguishable
from
your
typical
milk
stout
by
the
fact
that
it
lacks
the
drinkability
the
finest
examples
of
the
style
possess
its
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
gulper
another
enjoyable
beer
by
bells
though
side
thoughts
the
2009
batch
is
better
then
the
2008
imo
this
years
batch
is
sweeter
and
is
not
suffering
from
that
metallic
after
taste
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
i
find
the
15
99
price
tag
on
a
sixer
to
be
way
too
high
for
the
product
d
the
milksweet
stout
is
a
style
thats
beginning
to
grow
on
me
generally
i
am
more
of
an
ris
fan
but
the
sweetness
is
quite
a
welcomed
change
of
pace
a
great
beer
and
im
glad
i
have
another
dthis
is
a
solid
tasting
beer
with
a
great
mouthfeel
and
robust
creamy
flavors
i
could
drink
this
beer
quite
frequently
not
bad
could
have
been
better
could
have
been
worse
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
drinking
stout
that
i
can
have
a
few
of
in
a
sitting
a
nice
beer
from
bells
here
good
balance
and
though
its
a
bit
strong
its
still
quite
good
special
mention
must
be
made
about
the
label
its
stark
image
of
a
dark
skinny
tree
amidst
a
snowy
white
background
looks
like
an
agalloch
album
cover
d
honestly
i
really
like
this
beer
but
i
find
i
have
a
hard
time
drinking
it
as
a
session
beer
i
find
it
to
be
a
really
filling
beer
two
of
these
is
pretty
much
the
limit
for
me
the
taste
follows
suit
with
coffee
becoming
dominant
the
malt
balance
is
awesome
the
sweetness
and
roasty
bitterness
compliment
each
other
well
with
the
sweetness
in
front
solid
hop
presence
merges
with
the
slight
malt
bitterness
on
the
finish
the
creamy
silky
mouthfeel
and
great
balance
contribute
to
the
high
drinkability
score
overall
a
great
milk
stout
a
style
which
i
am
not
normally
a
fan
of
i
really
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
luckily
i
have
one
more
bottle
to
enjoy
pours
black
with
a
one
finger
high
cappucino
colored
head
surprisingly
bright
fruity
smell
i
almost
get
strawberries
along
with
a
dry
roasted
coffee
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
definitely
not
the
whiff
of
lactose
sweetness
i
expected
tastes
of
roasted
barley
and
coffee
with
a
nice
accompanying
malt
sweetness
that
hits
me
with
coconut
and
prunes
finish
is
roasty
to
a
spicy
degree
with
a
rich
cookie
dough
ending
with
a
hint
of
flora
great
blend
of
roast
and
sweet
malts
with
dark
fruits
and
coconuts
medium
to
full
body
with
a
silky
almost
chewy
presence
medium
carbonation
really
far
above
average
when
it
comes
to
sweet
stouts
a
treat
damn
you
bells
for
making
one
of
the
better
milk
stouts
i
have
had
and
i
cant
even
think
about
buying
your
beers
in
california
most
of
the
style
end
up
too
sweet
or
too
roasty
but
this
is
just
right
i
would
definitely
go
for
this
beer
again
another
great
stout
by
the
fine
folks
at
bells
church
key616
oz
d
great
this
is
one
delicious
sweet
stout
that
doesnt
push
the
sweetness
too
much
and
is
quite
balance
when
it
comes
to
sweetness
and
roast
in
the
taste
improvements
could
be
the
head
and
the
mouthfeel
but
you
cant
have
everything
sometimes
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
one
again
bells
comes
through
really
well
made
year
after
year
this
was
my
original
go
to
breakfast
stout
and
for
that
i
give
it
props
poured
from
a
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
very
nice
tan
head
that
faded
fairly
quickly
to
a
fine
tan
lacing
round
the
glass
pours
coffee
black
smells
sweet
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
this
beer
is
definitely
a
well
balanced
treat
this
beer
is
thick
and
creamy
definitely
one
of
the
creamier
stouts
that
i
have
had
it
starts
off
sweet
with
a
very
nice
roasted
finish
if
you
enjoy
stouts
this
is
a
must
try
drinkable
beer
the
sweetness
really
changes
the
moutfeel
of
the
beer
good
stuff
smooth
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
really
into
this
beer
drinkability
this
beer
was
rather
drinkable
especially
due
to
the
finish
the
carbonation
was
not
too
much
to
affect
the
drinkability
there
was
a
certain
smoothness
that
was
nice
and
the
nice
light
even
though
not
crisp
finish
was
rather
enjoyable
i
liked
the
big
flavor
for
the
smaller
abv
i
just
wish
it
was
a
bit
cheaper
as
i
do
with
quite
a
few
of
bells
beers
pours
clear
brown
with
slight
red
highlights
and
a
clingy
creamy
tan
head
the
scent
of
sweet
chocolate
is
subtle
on
the
nose
and
is
echoed
in
the
flavor
behind
the
taste
of
the
chocolate
there
is
a
background
coffee
flavor
the
body
is
mild
with
low
levels
of
carbonation
a
semitart
flavor
throughout
remains
to
the
finish
which
fades
slow
through
a
subtle
yet
robust
coffee
malt
flavor
as
the
flavor
fades
slowly
it
leaves
only
a
hint
of
alcohol
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
beer
my
only
real
complaint
is
that
it
is
a
little
filling
for
me
i
could
certainly
get
this
again
but
could
only
have
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
highly
enjoyable
d
this
is
very
rich
and
complex
or
a
cream
stout
definitely
has
more
character
than
say
left
hand
milk
stout
or
fff
moloko
there
is
a
lot
of
caramel
and
toffee
aspects
which
are
quite
nice
the
drinkability
is
good
but
takes
a
hit
due
to
its
intense
richness
drinkability
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
mild
and
the
low
carbonation
makes
it
easier
to
drink
quickly
i
wasnt
getting
the
complexity
a
lot
of
people
got
out
of
this
one
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
not
my
favorite
beer
but
solid
in
its
own
right
pours
thick
with
bubbles
taking
some
time
to
push
their
way
to
the
top
but
eventually
forming
a
nice
finger
tall
tan
head
that
eases
its
way
back
to
a
ring
with
a
few
chunky
islands
of
head
floating
in
the
middle
opaque
black
smells
good
but
its
very
subtle
admittedly
the
beer
is
a
little
cooler
than
it
ought
to
be
so
this
may
be
part
of
the
problem
taste
initially
suffers
for
the
same
reason
but
as
it
warms
up
the
flavor
profile
expands
nicely
nice
roasted
flavors
that
meld
with
a
slight
sweetness
reminds
me
of
burnt
marshmallow
the
mouthfeel
is
velvety
and
thick
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
sweet
stout
i
put
the
sweet
in
quotations
because
it
definitely
does
not
play
this
side
up
as
much
as
some
of
its
peers
its
a
stout
first
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
bitterness
nicely
leaving
a
very
full
character
taste
i
would
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
pours

cream
is
brewed
with
a
blend
of
10
different
malts
to
me
it
felt
like
the
brewery
was
trying
to
do
too
much
with
this
beer
and
a
little
restraint
would
go
a
long
way
it
wasnt
altogether
unenjoyable
but
this
isnt
one
that
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
d
very
highly
drinkable
body
is
great
for
its
style
though
its
not
as
malty
as
i
expected
kind
of
like
mackeson
xxx
stout
but
not
as
sweet
with
a
more
robust
body
definitely
recommended
cheers
d
double
cream
is
a
good
stout
overall
and
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
more
bitter
than
i
was
anticipating
tasty
but
not
overly
complex
as
i
tend
to
like
my
stouts
drinkability
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
mild
and
the
low
carbonation
makes
it
easier
to
drink
quickly
i
wasnt
getting
the
complexity
a
lot
of
people
got
out
of
this
one
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
not
my
favorite
beer
but
solid
in
its
own
right
the
combination
of
dessertlike
qualities
actually
cuts
down
allnight
drinkability
however
drinkability
fantastic
englishstyle
stout
lots
of
flavor
yet
very
easy
to
drink
however
i
am
strangely
not
compelled
to
seek
it
out
again
as
i
would
rather
have
the
kalamazoo
stout
d
a
very
good
milksweet
stout
had
a
couple
of
these
during
the
night
but
was
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
after
a
bit
definitely
intend
to
purchase
again
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
to
date
d
indeed
d
this
isnt
really
intended
to
be
a
session
beer
but
it
definitely
goes
down
easier
than
say
bells
kalamazoo
stout
this
has
a
silkier
softer
finish
that
while
still
a
bit
thicker
on
the
roastiness
than
i
would
like
for
the
style
allows
this
brew
to
go
down
very
smoothly
o
awesome
beer
ill
be
buying
more
to
share
with
friends
and
family
md
medium
bodied
and
very
creamy
fee
carbonation
gives
a
lightly
fizzy
feel
on
the
tongue
in
the
finish
very
easy
drinking
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
and
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
someone
who
seeks
a
dark
malt
character
supported
by
a
subtle
coffee
as
a
lactose
come
in
at
the
end
when
the
server
brought
this
to
me
there
was
easily
two
fingers
worth
of
head
on
this
beer
the
head
was
a
dark
caramel
color
that
stayed
around
for
two
minutes
or
so
before
subsiding
then
after
the
head
subsided
it
left
a
prolific
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
for
the
pure
aesthetics
of
appearance
this
easily
earned
a
five
just
wow
it
looks
just
like
a
stout
should
and
the
head
was
prevalent
and
pleasing
to
look
at
the
smell
was
faint
it
was
there
but
subtle
i
was
able
to
make
out
hints
of
vanilla
and
coffee
notes
the
taste
was
really
something
else
my
first
impression
was
that
it
was
a
bit
watery
but
as
i
continued
to
drink
and
as
it
continued
to
warm
bells
special
double
cream
stout
became
something
truly
wonderful
the
cream
was
definitely
present
but
not
overpowering
there
was
some
roasted
malts
and
i
think
i
picked
up
hazelnut
not
sure
if
thats
in
there
but
it
had
that
impression
on
my
tongue
the
coffee
notes
and
vanilla
balanced
so
well
together
that
it
created
a
truly
unique
taste
and
mouthfeel
that
ive
at
least
never
had
before
it
was
like
drinking
a
licorice
yogurt
for
real
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
enough
and
the
balance
of
the
ingredients
created
a
yogurt
like
texture
this
became
more
prevalent
as
it
continued
to
warm
but
i
was
enamored
i
ordered
another
beer
before
i
finished
this
one
and
i
didnt
want
to
stop
drinking
the
special
double
cream
stout
pick
this
up
buy
it
on
tap
whatever
just
try
this
beer
tastesuper
smooth
and
creamy
rich
roasted
coffee
and
toasted
maltsa
rather
dry
black
coffee
finish
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
nice
chewy
blend
of
coffeee
and
sweetish
malts
it
stays
subdued
true
through
the
middle
until
the
finish
where
enough
malty
complexity
opens
up
to
resemble
a
breaded
smoked
candied
culinary
treat
sweet
tobacco
and
cocoa
show
up
as
well
at
the
top
of
my
mouth
only
a
hint
of
lactic
sweetness
towards
the
very
end
which
turns
quickly
i
love
when
a
beer
changes
direction
on
a
dime
into
a
surprisingly
bold
bitter
hop
finish
the
medium
body
finds
its
way
into
all
crevices
and
deposits
the
leaflike
bitterness
of
the
hops
did
i
say
unexpected
i
thought
sweet
stouts
favor
round
malted
milkiness
instead
of
sharp
flavors
and
at
first
i
am
ready
to
deduct
points
but
then
again
the
chewy
and
wellcarbonated
mouthfeel
helps
keep
extremely
tight
reigns
on
the
beer
and
combined
with
the
smoky
dryness
this
is
a
restrained
affair
the
first
several
sips
i
was
not
a
big
fan
now
the
glass
is
empty
and
i
wish
i
had
another
to
give
this
a
fresh
look
that
is
a
compliment
again
i
am
allured
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
thin
yet
fluffy
khaki
head
smell
is
brown
sugar
forward
with
a
nice
roasted
matl
backbone
taste
is
very
sweet
up
front
the
malts
give
a
chocolate
carmel
and
molasses
taste
to
the
middle
and
hints
of
dark
fruit
smoke
and
earth
on
the
back
end
presence
of
bittering
hops
noted
full
bodied
yet
creamy
the
heavy
body
and
the
supersweet
taste
keep
this
otherwise
yummy
brew
from
being
top
notch
thanks
again
to
ericwo
for
sending
this
one
poured
an
inky
black
with
a
big
billowing
creamy
tan
head
that
left
lacing
all
the
way
down
my
glass
this
is
one
good
looking
beer
the
smell
is
good
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
chocolate
but
nothing
too
overwhelming
or
overpowering
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
taste
of
roasted
malt
and
a
little
chocolate
that
coats
your
tongue
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
really
a
well
rounded
beer
excellent
balance
an
excellent
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
bells
special
double
cream
is
a
nice
smooth
unremarkable
and
safe
stout
poured
a
dark
brown
with
red
highlight
when
held
to
a
light
just
a
thin
covering
for
a
head
and
that
faded
to
almost
nothing
the
aroma
was
coffee
and
sweet
the
taste
was
coffee
sweetened
with
chocolate
but
there
was
just
a
hint
of
sour
too
the
feel
was
mediumheavy
bodied
with
light
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
a
half
step
down
from
3f
moloko
an
enjoyable
beer
and
another
solid
effort
from
bells
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
fairly
good
example
of
the
style
and
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
its
not
my
favorite
but
i
could
see
having
it
again
sometime
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
very
silky
creamy
texture
to
it
a
nice
thick
and
hearty
beer
that
goes
down
easy
d
a
fantastic
milk
stout
that
is
very
well
balanced
and
just
well
done
overall
bells
really
seems
to
have
a
good
handle
on
stouts
and
im
very
excited
to
get
my
hands
on
java
and
expedition
this
was
a
really
easy
drinking
brew
sips
very
nicely
with
the
milky
mocha
flavor
this
goes
in
the
musttry
catagory
go
get
some
if
youre
looking
for
a
solid
stout
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
hints
of
ruby
along
the
bottom
and
sides
of
the
glass
head
was
light
brown
in
color
but
went
quite
quickly
a
few
pods
of
bubbles
remained
clinging
to
the
top
of
this
chocolate
coffee
and
prune
smelling
brew
i
got
an
almost
vanilla
extract
flavor
at
the
beginning
this
was
followed
by
coffee
and
sweet
roasted
malts
also
get
the
prune
taste
on
the
back
end
im
not
really
getting
the
chocolate
many
others
have
referenced
i
love
the
feel
of
this
id
have
it
again
thanks
for
the
haul
buschbeer
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
thin
film
of
brown
head
it
is
dark
brownblack
in
color
i
smell
dark
fruit
chocolate
and
coffee
very
nice
it
tastes
very
nice
as
well
i
get
the
coffee
right
off
the
bat
but
the
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
come
out
subtly
i
really
like
this
stuff
this
might
be
my
favorite
bells
that
i
have
sampled
i
still
have
a
lot
to
try
though
overall
a
little
out
of
my
standard
range
but
i
enjoyed
it
certainly
a
good
effort
from
bells
appears
dark
brownblack
almost
opaque
with
a
lightbrown
head
that
was
almost
nonexistent
following
a
standard
pour
aroma
was
mainly
chocolate
with
noticeable
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
very
inviting
as
might
be
expected
taste
was
very
sweet
upfront
with
a
light
chocolate
and
mild
roasted
malt
flavor
a
light
a
sweet
roasty
flavor
lingered
into
the
aftertaste
with
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
little
to
no
carbonation
detectable
body
was
light
to
medium
lighter
than
i
would
have
liked
this
beer
was
enjoyable
but
for
me
a
bit
too
rich
to
have
several
bye
pours
a
pitch
black
with
no
head
the
smell
is
all
malt
sweet
roasted
grain
in
the
nose
slight
hint
of
alcohol
taste
is
impressive
this
is
a
malt
bomb
very
thick
and
to
the
point
i
can
taste
chocolate
prunes
coffee
sweet
bitter
honey
this
leaves
a
sweet
thick
finish
on
my
palate
after
drinking
sip
after
sip
this
truly
needs
to
be
sipped
to
enjoy
the
strong
roasted
character
overall
this
beer
holds
a
special
place
it
has
so
much
flavor
profile
this
has
quickly
become
my
favorite
sweetmilk
stout
great
beer
that
drinks
like
a
desert
too
bad
this
isnt
distributed
to
atlanta
in
bottles
yet
for
this
stlye
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
would
only
have
one
at
a
time
i
look
forward
to
the
next
one
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
silky
creamy
and
velvety
the
body
of
the
beer
is
thick
and
rich
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
stout
with
a
lot
of
cream
flavor
packing
a
punch
the
beer
isnt
sweet
at
all
but
nonetheless
the
beer
is
wonderful
overall
good
full
stout
but
a
bit
strong
to
be
true
to
the
style
expected
more
out
of
this
one
especially
with
bells
on
the
label
didnt
have
the
depth
i
was
expecting
was
more
tart
than
i
thought
a
cream
stout
should
be
color
was
dark
little
lacing
left
on
the
glass
thinner
than
i
thought
it
should
be
run
of
the
mill
stout
good
but
not
worth
searching
all
over
for
i
dont
know
if
this
is
bad
six
pack
or
too
old
or
what
but
its
a
big
disappointment
to
me
if
i
not
bought
it
all
the
way
in
orlando
i
would
take
the
rest
back
i
see
its
rank
3rd
in
milk
stouts
i
have
to
try
again
from
somewhere
else
but
not
in
the
same
league
at
young
double
chocolate
stout
overall
your
traditional
black
color
with
tan
halo
around
the
rim
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
as
well
not
much
of
a
nose
honestly
maybe
a
touch
of
roasty
malt
and
coffee
taste
is
a
slight
dark
fruitiness
with
coffee
bitterness
and
a
twinge
of
creaminess
overll
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
for
a
stout
not
really
all
that
wild
about
this
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
depth
i
thought
it
would
just
seems
like
another
stout
to
me
a
standard
dark
black
color
with
a
tan
head
smell
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
a
touch
of
bittersweet
chocolate
in
the
nose
mixed
in
with
a
coffee
scent
taste
has
a
little
bit
of
a
metallic
bite
to
it
cream
taste
definitely
leaves
its
fingerprint
on
this
one
it
combines
with
the
bitter
coffee
and
semisweet
chocolate
very
well
a
little
on
the
thin
side
in
the
feel
and
not
as
robust
as
it
should
be
a
rare
miss
for
bells
its
a
little
bit
of
a
downer
but
not
horrible
special
double
cream
stout
is
an
unbelievably
easy
drinker
the
light
body
and
the
delicious
flavor
make
this
one
go
down
very
easily
once
again
bells
brews
a
winner
overall
a
tasty
and
utterly
enjoyable
milk
stout
with
plenty
of
chocolate
smoothly
creaminess
and
general
tastiness
to
please
the
most
discerning

light
12oz
poured
very
near
black
with
a
light
brown
head
that
was
quick
to
dissipate
and
left
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
were
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
rather
sweet
smelling
tastes
were
of
bold
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
coffee
finished
nicely
sweet
with
some
milk
chocolate
as
well
mouthfeel
was
velvety
smooth
and
creamy
another
solid
brew
from
bells
d
very
good
beer
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
given
how
heavy
it
is
d
very
drinkable
one
tasty
beer
pours
with
a
tan
head
that
thins
out
while
leaving
a
mild
lace
on
the
glass
the
color
is
dark
opaque
almost
black
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
cocoa
initial
flavor
is
very
much
cream
almost
like
chocolate
milk
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
the
10
malts
advertised
begin
to
give
a
more
complex
flavor
profile
in
addition
to
the
traditional
cream
stout
flavor
low
hop
flavor
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
all
the
malts
very
drinkable
beer
while
the
complex
malt
profile
teases
the
tongue
it
still
in
some
ways
is
just
another
cream
stout
just
a
more
expensive
cream
stout
worth
a
try
but
wouldnt
want
to
spend
too
much
on
what
could
be
more
affordable
in
other
brands
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
the
beer
is
more
carbonated
than
expected
and
the
beer
is
also
pretty
light
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
stout
of
this
magnitude
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
off
not
something
that
i
will
have
more
than
one
of
this
is
the
first
bells
brew
that
i
havent
liked
drinkability
is
great
as
these
tend
to
slide
down
the
throat
easily
i
really
enjoyed
each
of
these
double
cream
stouts
not
very
drinkable
i
used
to
think
this
beers
relative
rarity
around
my
parts
meant
it
was
especially
good
and
exclusive
now
i
wonder
if
its
relative
obscurity
relates
more
to
its
quality
although
i
loved
the
aroma
of
this
beer
the
taste
was
a
bit
too
burnt
and
bitter
for
my
liking
overall
this
was
definitely
one
of
the
more
extreme
versions
of
a
milk
stout
i
have
yet
to
try
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
best
milk
stouts
ive
ever
had
im
lucky
i
was
able
to
sample
this
on
tap
small
fizzy
bubbles
cascade
down
the
inside
of
the
glass
and
make
the
carmelcolored
head
grow
the
beer
is
perfectly
black
and
allows
no
light
to
pass
through
the
body
there
are
several
key
aromas
that
i
detect
chocolate
coffee
burnt
plums
molasses
brown
sugar
and
roasted
malt
an
excellent
combination
nice
creamy
lactic
texture
and
low
carbonation
not
too
heavy
either
but
not
too
easy
to
drink
sweet
coffee
and
roasted
malt
is
the
most
prodominant
flavor
feature
in
my
opinion
a
small
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
but
the
taste
seems
weaker
than
the
smell
if
that
makes
sense
after
sniffing
the
beer
i
expected
a
stronger
flavor
with
more
bite
its
pretty
mild
but
good
i
feel
some
alcohol
warmth
also
good
beer
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
this
stout
appears
a
barely
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
dense
creamy
lingering
foam
aroma
and
flavors
are
of
richly
roasted
barley
milk
chocolate
mocha
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
smooth
and
creamy
and
adequately
carbonated
great
stuff
overall
this
is
an
easydrinking
milk
stout
that
balances
that
milk
and
stout
portions
quite
nicely
worth
a
shot
notes
another
finely
crafted
beer
from
larry
bell
and
co
i
havent
had
s
good
milksweet
stout
in
a
while
so
this
seemed
like
a
fitting
choice
for
tonight
label

this
comes
from
batch

thanks
to
the
fam
for
briniging
this
beer
back
from
pennsylvania
for
me
pour
is
a
cool
black
with
about
half
a
finger
of
tanned
heading
sweet
lactose
comes
through
in
the
aroma
as
expected
along
with
some
cream
chocolate
and
coffee
more
of
the
same
comes
through
in
the
smell
a
roasty
edge
balances
out
the
sweetness
as
well
despite
the
abv
body
doesnt
feel
too
big
more
medium
if
you
ask
me
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
would
be
no
problem
with
some
dessert
overall
a
fine
beer
from
the
bells
line
not
their
best
stout
but
definitely
one
of
them
it
reminds
me
of
left
hands
version
a
bit
pair
this
with
some
tuffles
and
see
how
they
work
together
cheers
i
have
had
this
before
and
noticed
a
metallic
flavor
but
this
time
this
bottle
was
kept
in
the
fridge
the
whole
time
i
couldnt
even
find
it
this
beer
needs
to
be
drank
fairly
fresh
and
kept
cool
until
it
is
consumed
overall
out
of
the
few
6milk
stouts
i
have
had
this
one
is
tops
so
far
mfd
i
do
not
like
two
things
about
this
beer
the
carbonation
which
is
a
little
high
for
my
liking
in
this
style
and
the
dryness
which
is
bone
dry
other
than
that
pretty
drinkable
certainly
enjoyable
another
great
beer
from
bells
i
would
love
to
have
more
access
to
this
beer
due
to
the
relatively
low
abv
and
the
fact
that
it
is
not
overly
heavy
black
with
dark
brown
head
good
carbonation
smells
of
a
typical
stout
with
roastyness
and
sweet
malt
the
tasts
are
of
sweet
roasted
flavor
but
has
a
strange
tinney
hint
very
smooth
and
not
dry
like
a
regular
stout
i
liked
this
cream
stout
and
plan
on
trying
some
other
brands
to
see
what
the
cream
stout
is
all
about
being
sober
kicks
ass
steve
o
excellent
change
of
pace
with
this
brew
bells
has
yet
to
let
me
down
this
is
an
extremely
interesting
beer
i
am
pretty
sure
this
is
my
first
milk
stout
ive
had
other
sweet
stouts
but
not
that
were
like
this
at
least
that
i
could
remember
a
very
nice
brew
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
soon
well
played
bells
d
very
pleasant
to
drink
but
one
is
quite
enough
for
me
wow
i
really
loved
this
beer
and
im
not
a
particular
fan
of
the
milk
stout
style
a
big
fluffy
beige
head
tops
a
very
dark
brown
beer
very
inviting
sitting
around
with
a
couple
other
people
we
did
not
want
to
stop
sniffing
this
beer
rattling
off
flavors
such
as
the
obligatory
coffee
and
chocolate
but
as
diverse
as
peanut
butter
raisins
and
even
rice
milk
was
thrown
out
there
complex
in
the
flavor
as
well
lots
going
on
and
its
all
working
big
roasty
notes
molasses
aforementioned
coffee
and
a
nice
milkchocolateyness
almost
like
a
cup
of
coco
but
with
out
being
too
sweet
still
maintains
a
nice
finish
silky
and
creamy
on
the
palate
very
impressive
special
double
indeed
taste
is
refreshingly
sweet
and
light
mouthfeel
is
extraordinarily
thick
and
creamy
and
definitely
fits
the
name
there
isnt
much
hop
character
here
and
it
isnt
really
that
strong
in
terms
of
alcohol
presence
it
is
fairly
refreshing
and
a
good
desserttype
beer
d
this
is
a
slow
sipper
however
its
not
terribly
thick
and
might
be
nicer
once
the
heavier
stout
season
has
passed
now
if
it
only
smelled
better
notes
i
could
easily
make
this
a
session
beer
the
beer
was
medium
bodied
very
enjoyable
and
very
rich
but
at
7
5
abv
i
think
as
a
session
id
have
to
make
it
a
very
very
early
night
d
one
of
the
best
milk
stouts
ive
had
extremely
good
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
if
i
had
them
this
one
was
interesting
for
me
a
complex
enough
beer
but
one
dominated
by
one
flavor
for
me
the
nose
was
entirely
dominated
with
an
aroma
of
bread
bread
cooling
after
being
removed
from
the
oven
lots
of
yeast
and
flour
not
what
i
was
expecting
taste
is
sweet
very
sweet
actually
with
flavors
of
caramel
and
maple
syrup
good
stuff
however
again
the
huge
yeasty
flavor
of
bread
dominated
the
taste
while
not
bad
the
breadyeast
smell
is
nice
it
really
does
dominate
the
entire
beer
just
seemed
a
bit
strange
to
me
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
stout
from
bells
future
outlook
very
good
beer
the
smell
made
me
leery
but
the
taste
and
feel
were
better
than
expected
id
be
happy
to
have
this
again
overall
a
good
beer
maybe
not
the
big
brother
to
the
kzoo
stout
but
more
like
its
cool
cousin
the
one
who
would
buy
you
your
first
beer
and
it
would
be
this
one
maybe
still
good
solid
choice
for
a
tasty
beverage
like
good
music
beer
requires
balance
and
harmony
between
its
instruments
the
use
of
such
a
profound
malt
bill
has
provided
an
orchestra
of
grainy
malty
flavours
that
rotate
positions
like
a
game
of
musical
chairs
its
too
bad
that
with
this
being
my
last
bottle
im
going
to
be
the
one
left
without
a
seat
when
the
music
stops
thanks

it
smells
of

some
sort

and
dark

is
very

there
is
a
a
nice

to

the
carbonation
is
fine

this

could
bite
me
in
the
ass
if
i
had
a
bunch
d
the
abv
is
a
little
bit
high
to
be
really
drinkable
but
i
enjoy
most
of
the
products
by
bells
and
this
is
also
very
enjoyable
bells
has
impressed
me
a
number
of
times
and
this
one
is
immediately
one
of
my
favorites
im
not
sure
ive
ever
enjoyed
a
stout
this
much
this
is
a
rare
find
d
this
is
a
good
milk
stout
certainly
a
much
better
imperial
cream
stout
than
creme
brulee
its
goodbut
not
as
good
as
sessionable
beers
of
the
same
character
i
still
do
like
this
one
and
will
have
it
again
worth
trying
for
sure
d
high
quality
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
would
order
another
and
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
this
beer
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
not
too
coffeeee
if
that
is
a
word
pours

with
a
thin

into

glass
chocolate
notes
laced
with
espresso
both
in
the
nose
and
taste
smoot
mouthfeel
gets
more
expressive
and
tastier
as
it
warms
a
nice
nice
effort
from
bells
worth
the
price
big
thanks
to
psychohops
for
this
one
pours
thick
and
black
with
a
good
amount
of
mocha
brown
head
wafts
of
chocolate
and
coffee
come
from
the
pour
sticking
my
nose
in
the
glass
for
a
quick
huff
reveals
a
lot
of
coffee
with
some
hints
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
taste
is
also
coffee
with
a
smooth
milky
chocolate
sweetness
turning
to
a
light
hop
bitterness
great
aftertaste
and
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
thicker
than
most
but
nothing
crazy
very
good
beer
i
would
not
refuse
one
of
these
if
offered
but
i
doubt
i
will
seek
it
out
super
creamy
mouthfeel
silky
smooth
great
dark
chocolate
flavor
that
finishes
like
a
bitter
coffee
great
roasted
characteristics
in
this
one
this
was
a
very
easy
stout
to
drink
and
most
often
with
stouts
for
me
its
oneanddone
but
not
this
one
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
for
sure
recommend
d
i
find
it
to
be
very
drinkable
i
dont
think
its
too
strong
and
i
can
see
myself
having
a
few
at
a
function
that
off
bitter
flavor
is
the
only
thing
that
bothers
me
otherwise
this
would
be
very
drinkable
the
pour
was
nice
with
a
rich
dark
black
color
with
a
small
head
of
tan
rising
up
and
over
it
that
settled
down
gently
without
much
fan
fare
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
rich
vanilla
molasses
sweet
sugary
notes
and
a
touch
of
almost
licorice
like
candy
smooth
mellow
carbonation
let
this
one
sit
down
nicely
and
made
it
a
really
nice
sipper
i
have
to
admit
as
it
warmed
subtle
notes
of
chcolate
and
roasted
malts
took
over
but
always
leaving
it
moderatly
sweet
this
was
a
nice
little
stout
i
had
no
issues
polishing
this
one
off
and
would
have
no
issue
in
doing
so
again
a
solid
beer
all
around
i
would
have
to
say
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
and
as
advertised
would
go
every
well
with
chocolate
dessert
i
could
easily
sip
my
way
through
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
this
stout
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
big
head
that
has
a
brown
coffee
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
delicious
its
coffee
chocolatemollasses
dark
currant
fruity
smells
the
taste
is
the
same
but
so
smooth
for
a
stout
it
fills
the
mouth
with
a
maltycoffee
chocolate
semisweet
bitterness
that
just
warms
the
stomach
its
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
stout
although
i
only
want
1
at
a
time
try
this
one
as
a
first
stout
experience
or
keep
on
the
rotation
for
the
wintertime
as
i
do
only
available
in
the
winter
months
another
great
stout
from
bells
who
probably
has
the
most
seasonal
stouts
of
any
brewer
this
is
much
sweeter
and
fruitier
than
bells
kalamazoo
i
prefer
the
kalamazoo
over
this
and
that
shows
in
drinkability
d
delicious
flavor
and
slightly
higher
alcohol
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
have
to
say
this
is
among
the
better
cream
stouts
i
have
tried
i
really
wish
this
was
available
in
my
state
overall
a
good
beer
and
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
somewhere
i
would
get
it
but
i
am
not
going
to
waste
any
more
trading
efforts
to
seek
it
out
taste
has
a
slight
roastiness
and
is
mostly
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
not
much
aftertaste
with
this
stout
it
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
that
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
average
highly
drinkable
beer
that
i
enjoy
regularly
d
something
about
this
beer
really
works
for
me
i
cant
stop
drinking
it
i
think
it
just
goes
down
way
too
smooth
too
bad
its
10
for
a
sixer
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
it
was
milder
both
in
aroma
and
flavor
than
id
expected
which
makes
it
ever
so
drinkable
although
it
doesnt
really
fit
the
bill
of
youre
looking
for
a
strong
sweet
stout
an
excellent
brew
nonetheless
and
if
it
was
available
locally
it
may
be
one
of
my
goto
brews
this
brew
is
absolutely
phenomenal
pours
an
ofttan
head
with
lacing
smells
of
chocolate
and
coffee
malts
tastes
the
same
extremely
drinkable
almost
scary
if
priced
a
little
better
i
would
keep
this
in
the
fridge
year
round
very
smooth
and
silky
on
the
palate
a
nice
clean
and
crisp
follow
through
love
this
one
as
one
who
regularly
sessions
irish
dry
stouts
i
may
have
to
add
this
to
my
session
beers
nothing
too
overwhelming
but
with
an
abundance
of
flavors
on
the
nose
and
such
an
smooth
feel
i
could
def
find
myself
putting
back
a
few
of
these
overall
impressions
meh
its
okay
but
i
expect
something
thicker
and
creamier
from
a
cream
stout
the
aroma
was
very
nice
but
the
flavors
dont
follow
suit
and
the
result
is
a
somewhat
bland
stout
more
akin
to
an
irish
stout
than
a
sweet
milk
stout
cant
wait
to
try
it
on
draft
ddecent
very
smooth
beer
a
nice
cream
stout
ill
be
keeping
an
eye
out
for
this
one
as
an
occasional
indulgence
this
is
the
second
offering
ive
had
from
bells
and
like
the
first
it
makes
a
great
impression
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
their
other
offerings
im
adding
this
last
paragraph
about
two
hours
after
the
initial
pour
this
beer
just
tastes
better
and
better
the
longer
it
sits
and
warms
up
exceptional
brew
d
an
easy
drinking
stout
thats
smooth
with
a
nice
balance
of
malty
flavor
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice
beige
quarter
inch
head
smell
is
roasted
black
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
coffee
huge
coffee
flavor
in
the
taste
wasnt
expecting
that
at
all
really
dominant
a
little
cloying
in
the
mouthfeel
to
be
truthful
very
creamy
and
velvety
smooth
to
drink
very
good
but
still
cant
get
over
the
amount
of
coffee
in
the
flavor
that
im
getting
i
wanted
to
like
this
one
so
much
more
i
really
think
this
has
the
potential
to
be
a
remarkable
beer
but
its
not
quite
there
mouthfeel
is
superb
but
it
could
just
use
more
flavor
although
not
the
grainy
bite
with
some
tweaks
this
could
be
simply
divine
for
now
its
good
not
great
taste
pretty
thick
and
substantial
mouthfeel
roasted
coffee
upfront
creamy
taste
and
feel
on
the
swallow
mild
bitterness
aroma
was
a
little
off
the
usual
suspects
were
here
but
something
wasnt
quite
right
i
found
it
hard
to
pick
out
the
tastes
and
smells
on
this
one
i
knew
that
i
really
didnt
dig
the
harsh
bitterness
in
this
stout
and
i
like
hoppy
beers
the
harshness
was
more
from
a
burnt
wort
or
burnt
grain
taste
than
from
hops
thanks
to
drgonzo3705
for
tossing
this
on
a
recent
trade
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
this
once
on
name
alone
i
am
intrigued
pours
a
very
thin
head
and
a
jet
black
but
thin
looking
brew
its
odd
it
doesnt
look
as
much
like
a
stout
as
it
does
an
extremely
dark
ale
just
not
as
dense
a
fair
amount
of
carbonization
as
well
the
creamy
sweet
smell
is
strong
and
quite
delicious
that
cream
comes
through
hard
in
the
flavor
as
well
it
tastes
like
part
beer
and
part
cream
soda
there
is
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
in
a
stout
and
that
combined
with
the
sweetness
deters
me
from
being
able
to
have
much
more
than
one
overall
impression
bells
makes
some
fantastic
beers
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
its
disappointing
because
their
kalamazoo
stout
is
such
a
fantastic
beer
unless
you
are
a
big
fan
of
massive
oat
character
stay
away
from
this
beer
instead
save
yourself
some
cash
and
go
pick
up
a
sixer
of
bells
porter
or
traditional
kalamazoo
stout
drinkability
overall
highly
drinkable
beer
i
dont
have
much
of
a
sweet
tooth
so
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
a
couple
of
these
beers
this
beer
would
be
perfect
for
dessert
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
however
i
would
rather
get
a
different
product
for
the
price
i
enjoyed
expedition
a
lot
more
and
hopslam
is
such
a
bomb
this
is
one
of
bells
more
expensive
products
and
i
just
dont
like
it
enjoy
to
want
to
purchase
it
again
allinall
a
great
beer
just
not
my
favorite
d
a
rich
beer
to
sip
rich
flavors
with
not
a
ton
of
alcohol
md
not
alot
of
flavor
with
this
one
interesting
zest
in
the
finish
that
wasnt
expected
i
guess
id
have
to
try
it
again
to
see
what
a
different
day
would
bring
overall
a
highly
enjoyable
stout
from
an
excellent
brewery
right
up
there
with
lancasters
milk
stout
but
i
would
still
say
that
lancaster
takes
the
style
imho

this
beer
has
a
creaminess
that
is
heavenly
it
has
a
good
balance
on
sweetness
mixed
with
roasted
flavors
it
is
extremely
drinkable
partly
because
the
7
5
abv
is
hardly
noticeable
this
beer
would
be
great
alone
or
with
the
dessert
of
your
choice
d
not
to
bad
at
all
just
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
a
solid
brew
that
i
could
drink
again
d
i
really
love
the
milk
stout
if
bells
puts
this
much
craft
in
the
rest
of
their
beers
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
them
in
the
future
goes
down
smooth
easy
to
say
the
least
awesome
dessert
beer
well
done
by
bells
having
said
that
this
beer
has
the
unfortunate
distinction
of
being
of
the
same
style
as
one
of
my
goto
beers
mackesons
triple
xxx
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
i
would
personally
just
as
soon
grab
a
mack
i
try
not
to
let
my
personal
taste
interfere
with
objectivity
but
since
im
comparing
apples
to
apples
well
there
you
go
d
not
as
lactic
or
milky
as
other
milk
stouts
drinkability
its
hard
for
a
beer
to
have
all
of
the
aforementioned
qualities
and
be
as
easy
to
drink
as
a
domestic
and
alas
this
brew
fails
in
this
category
i
found
it
hard
to
have
more
than
2
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
sticky
residue
harsh
taste
and
full
bodied
characteristics
allow
this
beer
to
be
a
treat
rather
than
a
go
to
brew
d
an
exceptional
beer
in
the
drinkability
realm
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
smoother
stout
that
could
handle
itself
on
an
evening
of
enjoyment
quite
like
this
beer
if
there
is
one
fault
to
the
beer
it
is
the
busy
taste
you
get
so
many
tastes
and
flavors
all
at
once
by
the
end
of
the
glass
you
can
notice
some
additional
flavors
coming
forth
but
its
like
watching
someone
in
the
fog
almost
but
not
quite
finishes
slighty
dry
and
bitter
nice
example
for
a
milk
stout
in
conclusion
i
like
this
one
a
lot
a
little
heavy
for
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
this
is
to
be
expected
from
such
a
robust
beer
i
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
and
i
would
have
to
say
i
think
it
was
better
than
most
of
the
other
bells
beers
i
have
tried
t
the
taste
is
good
its
got
the
complexity
of
a
good
stout
but
lacks
certain
flavors
that
should
be
there
it
doesnt
live
up
to
its
name
wheres
the
double
cream
regardless
the
oat
presence
is
noticeable
some
dryness
is
provided
through
both
roasted
malts
and
coffee
bitterness
some
pretty
good
chocolate
come
out
and
very
slight
dark
fruit
hints
mainly
rasphberry
as
noticeable
in
the
smell
tons
of
bourbon
not
too
much
but
slightly
overpowering
to
the
other
flavors
theres
a
slight
roughness
to
the
flavor
which
im
assuming
is
coming
from
the
caramel
malts
this
is
a
good
beer
im
interested
to
see
if
it
will
smooth
out
with
time
easily
my
least
favorite
bells
beer
so
far
ive
tried
14
to
date
its
not
at
all
badi
dont
think
even
the
worst
bells
beer
would
be
terribleand
it
wont
be
a
chore
getting
through
the
other
3
remaining
from
the
6pack
but
i
probably
wont
return
and
yeah
we
should
review
to
style
and
i
believe
i
am
but
this
has
never
been
my
favorite
style
so
this
beer
is
nothing
like
the
expedition
stout
and
is
a
nice
departure
from
some
of
the
riss
ive
been
drinking
of
late
a
very
nice
effort
from
bells
to
no
great
surprise
recommended
for
the
super
stout
lover
pours
a
nearly
impenetrable
black
with
a
tall
brown
head
with
long
retention
the
smell
is
of
surprisingly
faint
but
still
delicious
cocoa
powder
taste
is
roasty
big
on
the
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
elements
more
sweet
than
bitter
all
around
yummy
could
be
considerably
heavier
but
still
its
weight
is
sufficient
and
quite
easily
sustainable
if
you
want
to
drink
several
of
these
guys
in
a
sitting
the
body
is
firmly
medium
not
to
thick
and
full
but
far
from
thin
finish
is
a
little
fruitier
and
probably
hoppy
its
a
little
hard
to
tell
but
i
think
the
hops
are
contributing
that
slight
amount
of
complexityadding
fruitiness
at
each
turn
pretty
drinkable
if
not
totally
adventurous

it

me

the

i
could
ive
had
the
beer
from
the
bottle
before
and
i
like
it
a
lot
but
its
just
excellent
on
cask
recommended
d
due
to
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
it
is
very
difficult
to
drink
more
than
a
beer
or
two
at
a
time
it
should
be
paired
with
a
hearty

with

there
isnt

much

in

which
is

hmmmm
a

this
is

it

in

d
this
seems
like
a

beer
while
this
brew
goes
down

easy
why
even

i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
coming
in

will
likely
not

it
again

conclusion
the
best

stout
ive
tried
yet
and
im
not
typically
huge
on
the

bells
has
a
real
winner
here
this
would
be
an
absolutely
fantastic
dessert
beer
this
would
kill
with
a
nice
yorkshire
caramel
shortbread
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
around
with
its
great
blend
of
sweetness
and
roasty
character
very
solid
and
interesting
stout
flavors
could
be
stronger
but
well
worth
trying
the
beer
was
cold
when
i
started
but
i
let
it
warm
up
before
i
finished
it
when
warmer
there
are
more
complex
flavors
and
other
nuances
i
would
suggest
drinking
slightly
colder
than
room
temperature
for
maximum
enjoyment
overall
a
good
drinkable
cream
stout
and
not
just
a
stout
for
stout
lovers
but
one
that
would
go
over
well
with
many
beer
drinkers
regardless
of
their
favorites
this
could
definitely
work
its
way
into
a
reserved
spot
in
my
fridge
quality
drinkability
other
than
the
mouthfeel
i
like
this
brew
better
out
of
the
bottle
it
might
have
been
that
the
bottle
had
a
little
age
on
it
unlike
the
fresh
cask
but
it
seemed
to
make
a
world
of
difference
still
pretty
tasty
though
and
glad
to
have
had
again
drinkable
and
delicious
from
a
killer
brewery
maybe
my
favorite
black
beer
from
bells
d
very
drinkable
like
above
the
sweetness
eases
the
coffee
like
bitterness
d
solid
brew
but
i
was
slightly
disappointed
by
this
one
in
the
bottle
as
i
found
it
phenomenal
from
the
tap
still
an
enjoyable
milk
stout
that
is
overly
sweet
and
can
be
enjoyed

on

bottle
not
the
7

it
says
here
its
not
a
particularly
heavy
beer
and
with
the
abv
at
a
reasonable
level
you
could
certainly
have
many
of
these
but
the
beer
just
doesnt
do
that
much
for
me
it
will
probably
be
my
last
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
thin
brown
head
aroma
of
malty
chocolate
roasted
coffee
and
hops
very
smooth
easy
drinking
stout
nice
balance
of
creamy
chocolate
maltiness
with
a
nice
touch
of
bitter
hoppiness
i
wasnt
entirely
sure
how
this
was
going
to
turn
out
ive
tried
so
many
milk
stouts
and
was
curious
about
bells
double
take
on
the
style
being
that
they
like
to
try
doing
thier
own
thing
i
was
definitely
not
disappointed
by
this
and
if
you
come
across
it
ever
i
highly
reccomend
a
try
d
it
is
a
touch
too
bitter
for
my
taste
but
the
mouthfeel
is
so
wonderful
that
i
find
myself
wanting
another
sip
and
another
pours
black
with
a
dark
tan

of
chocolate
caramel
and
fresh
roasted
coffee
lots
of

a

d
stouts
at

this

d
this
is
a
very
drinkable

stout
i
think
i
prefered
the
2007

this

is
much
lower

only
thing
i

mouthfeel
its
just
too
prickly
and
a

too
thin
if
bells
works
on
that
but
i
appreciate
that
it
has
complexity
and
value

someone

pretty
good
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
all
year
long
and
sweet
cream
taste
is
basically
the
same
double
cream
i
think
this
is
the
best
in
terms
of
drinability
then
this
becomes
a
quality
session
stout
perfect
for
those
cool

dont

this
beer
is
a
pretty
standard
above

stout
if
thats
not
an
oxy
moron
not
to
say
you
shouldnt
try
it

its

cheers

as
my
journey
into

continues
im
falling
more
in
love
with
bells
and
their
collection
of
stouts
wonderful
winter
nightcap
i
feel
like
i
am
drinking
a
mackesons
milk
stout
and
that
is
a
good
thing
i
am
going
to
have
to
drink
these
beer
back
to
back
to
get
my
bearings
because
they
seem
almost
the
same
which
is
a
good
thing
very
smooth
nice

roasty
chocolate
coffee
and

absolutely
solid
i
do
not
need

way
to
go
bells
brewing
conclusion
i
generally
prefer
imperial
stouts
and
things
of
the
more
bitter
variety
but
this
is
a
great
beer
i
think
i
like
it
more
than
the
average
person
on
here
but
i
cant
get
enough
of
it
and
absolutely
crave
it
when
it
is
out
of
season
this
beer
will
make
your
night
better
it
might
not
solve
your
problems
but
it
will
certainly
help
you
forget
about
them
for
a
while
pours
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
smell
is
sweet
with
some
burnt
characters
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
a
moderately
strong
alcohol
smell
taste
is
similar
yet
very
weak
for
a
stout
the
taste
was
somewhat
underwhelming
the
aftertaste
is
subtle
with
the
burnt
flavor
showing
up
most
the
mouthfeel
was
not
very
smooth
and
had
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
i
really
wanted
to
enjoy
this
beer
but
didnt
find
much
to
rave
about
a
decent
stout
worth
checking
out
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
bells
would
like
to
thank
bigern
again
for
this
brew
served
slightly
chilled
in
a

poured
a
very
deep

nothing
too
overwhelming
here
tasted
of
freshly
roasted
ingredients
short
blasts
of
espresso
with
maybe
a
touch
of
alcohol
very
little
carbonation
has
a
somewhat
thick
almost
milky
feeling
in
the
mouth
didnt
think
it
was
anything
spectacular
but
it
was
pretty
good
drinkability
gets
high
marks
as
i
have
just
finished
the
beer
and
am
wishing
i
had
another
at
my
disposal
this
is
quite
a
complex
beer
perhaps
having
to
do
with
the
ten
malts
used
that
takes
a
bit
of
dissecting
pick
one
up
and
drink
it
slowly
the
bottle
shows
the
code
7250
though
roasted

a
slightly
better

you
that

on
the
trees
or
gone
into
some
nice
preserves
or
something
keep
your
cherries
out
of
my
beer
please
skip
this
one
in
the
future
and
pay
the
extra
money
for
the
bells
expedition
stout
totally
worth
it
the
look
and
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
fantastic
however
the
taste
is
too
tart
for
me
and
i
did
not
like
the
texture
of
this
beer
while
i
was
drinking
it
if
you
like
sour
beers
though
you
will
enjoy
this
one
maybe
this
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
but
the
cherry
tasted
so
artificial
it
made
me
gag
i
am
a
huge
stout
lover
but
this
was
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
overall
i
really
really
liked
this
beer
the
abv
is
not
that
high
and
it
goes
great
as
a
dessert
or
with
some
kind
of
chocolate
or
vanilla
or
cheesecake
i
dont
understand
the
low
ratings
on
this
one
not
much
cherry
in
the
aroma
smells
like
an
aromatic
vanilla
laced
chocolate
stout
the
tart
cherries
hit
you
in
the
taste
with
dark
chocolate
reminiscent
of
of
a
holiday
boxed
dark
chocolate
with
sour
cherry
filling
at
first
it
was
a
little
strange
for
a
stout
lover
who
loves
the
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
but
after
having
a
bite
of
whole
wheat
bread
this
beer
truly
shines
not
a
session
beer
but
is
superb
with
a
meal
this
beer
cant
decide
if
its
a
stout
or
sour
4th
of
the
evening
smooth
black
with
a
mocha
head
and
a
hint
of
amber
smells
roasted
bitter
tart
and
tastes
very
much
much
the
same
best
cherry
stout
ive
had
so
far
not
cloying
artificial
or
overwhelming
like
others
ive
had
this
is
a
smooth
and
very
tasty
beer
worth
every
sip
a
pleasant
mixture
of
dark
chocolate
and
tart
cherry
like
if
a
stout
and
a
wild
ale
had
a
delicious
baby
if
you
like
the
taste
of
tart
sours
and
stouts
you
should
try
this
beer
it
really
is
good
i
really
enjoyed
it
cherry
was
too
cloying
like
cough
syrup
mouthfeel
is
thick
syrup
like
and
pours
out
weird
even
the
way
it
rolls
out
of
the
bottle
is
strange
like
syrup
i
cant
believe
bells
put
this
out
maybe
if
this
were
going
to
be
a
sour
stout
it
might
have
been
better
but
this
beer
tastes
unfinished
the
sourness
of
the
cherry
juice
overpowers
the
rest
of
the
stout
im
a
huge
sours
fan
but
this
basically
taste
like
a
stout
that
was
infected
and
not
in
a
good
way
i
can
smell
the
cherries
and
the
roast
but
that
doesnt
come
through
in
the
taste
i
like
bells
but
this
was
not
good
there
was
absolutely
no
head
when
this
poured
and
gave
off
a
slight
roasted
malt
and
sour
smell
the
taste
was
medicinal
cherry
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
flavors
just
did
not
mesh
together
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
by
bells
price
point
1
6712
oz
bottle
c
bad
taste
not
what
i
thought
it
would
be
nasty
skip
it
god
awfull
did
i
say
nasy
worse
than
camo
black
special
resurve
nice
tasting
stout
with
good
reason
to
call
it
cherry
the
cherry
is
immediately
noticeable
has
almost
a
slight
burn
effect
when
drinking
it
which
i
liken
to
a
whiskey
pours
a
rich
black
color
with
cherry
red
accents
visible
during
the
pour
once
it
hits
the
glass
the
subtle
red
hue
is
barely
detectable
an
interesting
and
unique
appearance
despite
the
lack
of
lacing
or
head
retention
the
scent
is
that
of
a
silky
porter
with
chocolate
malts
and
light
roast
theres
a
sour
cherry
aroma
hiding
in
the
background
the
first
sip
is
surprising
to
say
the
least
the
slight
chocolate
malt
sweetness
is
absolutely
crushed
by
a
shockingly
sour
flavor
a
lemonlike
puckering
tartness
and
vague
cherry
gives
way
to
an
ashy
finish
the
body
and
carbonation
are
thin
with
little
intrigue
wow
pretty
much
a
train
wreck
it
was
as
if
someone
poured
lemon
juice
in
to
a
nondescript
porter
then
emptied
their
ashtray
in
to
it
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
think
this
one
was
spoiled
judging
by
the
bottle
date
11614
and
the
other
comments
this
is
the
intended
product
i
nearly
relegated
this
to
drain
pour
status
but
a
part
of
me
was
really
rooting
for
bells
so
i
gave
it
the
old
college
try
i
must
admit
i
am
not
particularly
fond
of
sours
after
it
reached
room
temp
it
was
considerably
easier
to
drink
the
underlying
flavors
of
the
stout
became
more
discernible
and
attempted
to
keep
the
sour
notes
in
balance
attempt
is
the
key
word
either
way
this
is
one
sour
beer
and
the
flavor
profile
just
doesnt
add
up
ashy
tobacco
smoke
and
citric
sour
cherry
tartness
are
just
an
odd
combination
quite
frankly
it
just
doesnt
work
tastes
like
dark
chocolate
covered
cherries
and
toast
great
by
itself
and
would
be
good
with
chocolate
cake
highly
recommended
my
700th
different
brew
pours
black
with
minimal
head
smells
of
roast
malt
some
chocolate
and
licorice
cherry
comes
through
on
the
tongue
slightly
tart
some
chocolate
dark
molasses
licorice
hint
of
coffee
and
burnt
toast
medium
body
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
good
beer
that
i
found
rather
unique
but
not
a
standout
by
any
stretch
oily
black
lacing
brown
roasted
choc
malt
burnt
ends
cocoa
and
backend
cherry
star
and
finish
tart
roasty
choc
middle
interesting
looked
great
disappointing
otherwise
smell
as
taste
were
reminiscent
of
something
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
rather
thin
as
well
nobody
is
immune
to
a
clunker
sweetest
stout
i
have
ever
tasted
there
is
just
something
offputting
about
this
beer
for
me
i
freely
admit
that
i
am
a
bells
fanboy
so
i
have
tried
cherry
stout
now
a
few
times
across
many
years
but
everytime
i
get
the
same
sour
cloying
aftertaste
not
a
sour
stout
like
funk
metal
or
tart
of
darkness
more
like
it
was
spoiled
i
have
given
up
on
this
one
and
have
moved
onto
greener
pastures
hard
to
finish
taste
was
overpowered
by
tartness
sampled
on
tap
at
surfside
tap
house
on
oceanside
full
disclosure
this
beer
had
been
on
tap
over
2
months
so
perhaps
not
the
experience
the
brewer
intended
pours
a
very
attractive
rich
black
color
with
a
beautiful
dark
tan
head
smell
is
dominated
by
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
cherry
sweetness
lurking
wow
taste
is
surprisingly
tart
maybe
like
a
tart
version
of
a
chocolate
covered
cherry
while
i
generally
dig
sours
this
combination
is
a
bit
off
putting
mouth
feel
is
almost
gritty
interesting
but
not
something
i
need
to
try
again
an
enjoyable
stout
the
tart
cherry
can
be
a
bit
strong
at
times
but
i
think
it
mixes
well
with
the
stout
body
the
body
can
be
a
bit
beefier
i
suppose
overall
i
feel
that
this
would
have
been
better
as
a
milk
stout
with
more
chocolate
malt
solid
but
not
awe
inspiring
a
novelty
but
nothing
i
would
do
more
than
get
a
single
of
couldnt
get
past
the
fact
that
it
just
tastes
like
a
puckering
infecting
stout
i
knows
its
a
tart
cherry
stout
but
all
i
can
taste
is
infection
way
too
tart
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
are
ready
for
tartness
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
took
me
by
surprise
arena
was
not
enjoyable
but
a
renderer
that
me
pallet
adjusted
and
it
wasnt
too
bad
i
was
able
to
sip
through
it
and
enjoy
it
personally
i
wouldnt
order
it
at
a
bar
at
full
price
and
i
wouldnt
buy
it
but
as
a
special
at
the
bar
and
considering
it
is
7
its
not
bad
to
have
one
and
switch
it
up
overall
i
love
the
tart
michigan
cherries
that
bells
is
using
in
this
so
i
really
want
to
like
this
beer
however
you
do
get
the
tart
cherry
notes
but
it
just
isnt
integrated
in
a
way
that
comes
together
for
me
maybe
if
there
was
more
chocolate
i
dont
know
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
bells
stouts
not
good
too
much
sour
cherry
juice
not
enough
stout
overall
this
is
more
of
a
novelty
beer
than
anything
the
cherry
taste
is
contrived
and
achieves
no
synergy
with
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
the
harsh
prickliness
is
offputting
and
theres
just
not
enough
else
there
to
overcome
its
flaws
if
you
want
cherry
find
yourself
some
new
glarus
or
a
good
sour
ale
overall
i
cant
say
they
didnt
tell
me
what
it
was
still
its
kinda
disappointing
not
terribly
balanced
if
you
dont
like
big
fruit
notes
especially
tart
ones
stay
away
do
people
really
not
like
this
i
thought
it
was
a
brilliant
fusion
of
tart
cherries
and
rich
earthy
stout
the
fruit
is
maybe
a
little
medicinal
in
the
nose
of
this
dark
chocolate
colored
forthy
tan
headed
wonder
sharp
sting
from
the
cherry
and
the
alcohol
is
maybe
a
little
much
on
the
nose
but
i
think
its
pleasantly
mellowed
by
the
charred
dark
barley
character
and
a
hint
of
sweet
cocoa
the
flavor
is
better
balanced
i
think
than
the
nose
but
equally
dynamic
it
is
a
stout
first
lots
of
nice
deep
dark
grain
properties
and
a
perplexing
smoothness
while
the
cherries
come
on
later
they
marry
well
into
the
dark
grain
a
definitely
chocolate
covered
cherry
thing
going
on
here
like
those
little
ones
soaked
in
booze
you
eat
at
holiday
time
dark
authentic
fruit
with
enough
tartness
to
almost
trick
me
into
tasting
wild
ale
yeast
or
bacteria
its
not
though
its
just
piquant
enough
too
and
clean
in
the
finish
for
the
style
not
the
least
bit
sweet
i
like
its
complexity
and
its
drinkability
it
feels
perfect
with
snow
and
chirstmas
coming
on
and
like
all
bells
beer
its
expertly
made
i
would
definitely
buy
this
if
it
were
available
in
colorado
nice
tart
crisp
cherry
ive
found
fruits
are
tough
to
do
in
beers
most
of
the
time
and
thats
true
with
this
one
too
it
just
wasnt
special
and
was
a
bit
too
tart
o
not
what
i
expected
from
a
bells
stout
much
less
a
cherry
stout
the
cherry
was
apparently
code
for
sour
stout
with
some
cherry
qualities
ive
seen
this
in
six
packs
and
loving
most
bells
i
had
reluctantly
passed
this
up
for
others
on
the
shelf
glad
i
did
a
pint
was
all
i
needed
try
it
but
at
a
bar
first
before
purchasing
the
6er
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
hey
it
comes
from
bells
so
the
expectations
are
always
high
o
a
good
stout
but
i
prefer
mine
cherryless
however
if
you
like
cherries
and
stouts
you
are
in
luck
an
interesting
mix
of
tart
cherries
and
roasted
malt
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
not
sure
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
again
but
glad
to
try
it
straight
out
of
the
gate
this
one
leaves
me
conflicted
i
want
to
like
this
beer
it
pours
jet
black
and
almost
oily
devoid
of
any
carbonation
or
even
lacing
its
nose
is
its
best
feature
a
malty
sweetness
with
presence
of
coffee
and
cherries
it
tastes
like
a
nice
stout
with
some
great
malt
accompanied
by
coffee
which
introduces
some
bitterness
the
second
half
of
its
flavour
quickly
turns
into
a
sickly
sweet
experience
before
the
tart
cherries
finish
it
off
this
is
the
part
which
leaves
me
conflicted
the
stout
by
itself
would
be
great
the
middle
is
very
offputting
and
the
cherries
at
the
end
just
dont
seem
to
belong
in
the
end
the
mixture
of
sweet
alcohol
and
tart
is
reminiscent
of
cough
syrup
i
have
a
second
bottle
and
hope
to
revisit
this
after
a
better
experience
pours
midnight
black
a
decent
tan
head
that
dissipates
somewhat
quickly
with
average
retention
lacing
is
nice
though
coating
my
glass
from
start
to
finish
smell
is
classic
export
stout
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
faint
coffee
no
cherries
in
the
aroma
for
me
the
flavor
saves
this
one
for
me
a
ton
of
fresh
tart
cherries
up
front
followed
by
roasted
malt
chocolate
mild
sweetness
and
espresso
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
extremely
creamy
finishing
just
a
bit
dry
and
somewhat
chalky
overall
very
enjoyable
and
tasty
cherry
stout
that
is
well
balanced
and
definitely
left
me
wanting
to
drink
another
a
great
beer
for
the
fall
season
upon
us
its
a
different
stout
not
something
i
would
crave
but
its
not
undrinkable
it
is
a
good
blend
of
the
great
michigan
cherries
with
bells
stout
the
tart
cherry
is
just
to
overwhelming
for
my
tastes
i
could
no
even
finish
the
bottle
i
would
have
preferred
a
more
subtle
cherry
im
sure
there
are
those
who
will
love
this
its
just
not
for
me
o
this
is
a
great
beer
and
is
very
refreshing
for
a
stout
highly
recommend
and
dont
understand
why
it
only
has
a
score
of
80
except
that
people
may
expect
it
to
be
a
sweet
cherry

not
much
of

speak
of
smell

a

taste
is
quite
tart
im
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
much
tartness
it
has
there
is
a
subtle
sweetness
from
the
cherries
too
its
nowhere
near
being
a
cherry
bomb
but
the
cherry
notes
really
do
add
something
special
to
this
beer
as
a
stout
its
got
good
roast
also
id
buy
it
again
age
it
again
and
consider
it
pretty
underrated
at
a
mere
80
points
ba
score
bottled

poured
into
a
snifter
the
cherries
are
still
tart
and
delicious
while
the
base
stout
is
roasty
malt
with
a
slight
bitterness
if
memory
serves
correct
this
beer
tastes
a
lot
like
it
did
fresh
the
smell
is
fantastic
rich
and
roasty
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
cherry
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
very
tart
and
briney
im
trying
really
hard
to
enjoy
this
one
but
if
cant
get
past
the
initial
taste
of
olive
juice
type
flavor
i
personally
think
that
the
cherry
juice
needs
to
toned
down
a
lot
in
order
to
make
this
one
palatable
glad
i
can
say
ive
tried
this
one
but
i
personally
didnt
care
for
it
and
wouldnt
drink
it
again
good
beer
nice
to
have
at
the
end
of
cherry
season
too
the
appearance
and
smell
bring
forth
the
stout
dont
get
any
cherries
on
the
nose
those
came
later
on
the
finish
slightly
sour
which
i
like
this
beers
starts
out
all
stout
then
finishes
almost
all
cherry
syrup
occasionally
youll
get
the
stout
mixed
with
cherry
tartness
which
is
excellent
good
but
not
great
would
like
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
sometime
d
not
very
drinkable
thin
and
tart
does
not
hold
up
well
to
room
temperature
this
is
cherry
juice
with
a
little
stout
not
the
other
way
around
unfortunately
carbonation
feels
a
bit
too
lively
i
will
definately
be
drinking
more
of
these
and
hopefully
the
barrell
aged
variety
as
well
dark
black
in
color
and
impenetrable
to
any
light
the
head
is
minimaldark
brownand
does
not
cover
half
of
the
top
of
the
beer
aroma
of
roasted
barley
along
with
more
of
a
sweet
cherry
note
that
seems
almost
along
the
lines
of
a
plum
note
the
sweetness
of
the
cherries
is
on
the
front
end
and
nicely
transitions
into
a
bitterness
from
the
roasted
barley
the
mouth
is
pretty
carbonated
and
creamy
overall
a
really
drinkable
beer
that
i
love
and
will
definitely
be
buying
it
every
year
i
do
give
credit
for
cherries
tasting
real
but
the
cherries
are
almost
too
tart
for
the
price
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
worth
trying
one
time
though
o
interesting
beer
but
i
find
the
sourness
somewhat
distracting
in
a
stout
that
absent
the
cherry
would
be
offering
a
smooth
lusciousness
and
very
nice
roasted
malt
characteristics
as
it
is
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
pretty
sure
it
wont
enter
the
short
list
of
my
goto
options
overall
i
like
what
bells
tried
to
do
here
but
i
think
it
missed
the
mark
the
cherries
are
a
little
too
tart
while
somewhat
contradictory
the
finish
is
too
sweet
good
beer
here
and
ill
revisit
it
in
the
future
but
this
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
way
most
bells
beers
do
by
itself
it
is
pretty
sour
for
a
stout
but
with
some
food
it
is
really
good
it
definitely
is
an
interesting
concoction
and
the
kind
of
treat
i
deserve
o
i
am
extremely
disappointed
here
but
i
still
want
to
try
the
java
special
double
cream
and
black
note
obviously
i
dont
think
im
going
to
be
able
to
finish
this
but
will
probably
just
share
it
with
someone
or
cook
with
it
o
i
enjoy
the
complexity
of
flavors
offered
in
this
brew
but
i
thought
it
was
just
a
little
too
much
with
the
coffee
smokey
flavor
and
sour
cherries
together
i
really
like
the
idea
of
a
sour
stout
and
will
be
looking
for
beers
of
similar
style
thick
black
solid
body
nice
lacing
wet
mouthfeel
smells
of
sour
cherries
front
palate
is
all
port
and
merlot
lots
of
sour
cherries
and
some
coffee
bite
midpalate
full
bitter
stout
riding
over
chocolate
covered
cherries
with
some
more
merlot
lots
of
sour
its
real
hard
to
make
a
consistent
beer
flavor
with
something
this
sour
but
they
pull
it
off
very
drinkable
despite
the
complexity
not
for
amateurs
a
real
sour
beer
in
stout
form
3
5
out
of
5
good
o
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
at
17
996pk
not
at
all
worth
the
money
i
really
wish
it
was
more
flavorful
and
cherryier
as
this
would
really
accentuate
the
transition
from
sweet
to
tart
if
i
had
paid
9
996pk
like
most
of
bells
beers
i
would
have
a
much
better
opinion
of
this
beer
probably
better
on
tap
bells
is
my
go
to
brewery
when
i
cant
decide
on
what
im
in
the
mood
for
i
love
cherries
and
stouts
so
i
imagined
this
being
a
match
made
in
heaven
unfortunately
it
was
far
from
that
im
a
guy
that
likes
tart
so
when
i
say
its
tart
take
notice
it
is
worth
trying
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
add
it
to
your
palate
of
tastes
thanks
to
illudium
for
the
sample
o
this
beer
isnt
really
that
heavy
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
has
a
nice
mixture
of
cherry
flavors
while
i
usually
enjoy
beers
from
bells
i
was
very
disappointed
with
the
cherry
stout
i
like
both
cherries
and
stout
but
the
bcs
was
in
my
opinion
difficult
to
drink
as
each
sip
left
a
lingering
bad
aftertaste
on
the
palate
in
addition
it
was
hard
to
taste
the
cherry
juice
the
beer
tasted
artificial
o
not
something
want
all
the
time
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
stout
o
i
think
its
great
i
do
warn
you
though
its
super
tart
and
the
cherries
really
give
your
taste
buds
the
blam
style
but
its
still
got
that
nice
bitter
chocolatey
malty
background
to
remind
you
its
a
stout
if
youre
new
and
wanting
to
get
into
stouts
i
would
recommend
this
to
you
if
youre
not
a
sweet
beer
person
id
still
say
try
it
but
just
be
warned
its
sweet
and
tart
o
im
surprised
how
low
this
beer
scores
its
a
very
innovative
and
unique
beer
people
flavor
ales
all
the
time
with
cherry
juice
but
they
do
it
in
a
stout
and
pull
it
off
try
it
incredible
beer
with
an
initial
sourness
that
balanced
with
its
cherries
notes
and
strong
roasted
and
hoppy
base
try
it
but
its
not
tart
or
sweet
like
youd
think
for
a
dessert
in
a
glass
a
dark
brown
beer
with
a
red
tint
and
a
nice
tan
head
the
tart
flavor
was
offputting
at
first
but
as
i
continued
drinking
it
i
began
to
enjoy
the
combination
of
tart
cherry
and
roasty
caramel
this
is
one
i
would
revisit
again
maybe
after
aging
it
some
o
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
the
stout
world
i
actually
like
the
tartness
of
the
cherry
juice
however
it
somewhat
overpowered
the
base
stout
would
like
to
see
more
emphasis
on
chocolate
malt
to
give
it
that
chocolate
covered
cherry
effect
o
the
sourness
creates
imbalance
without
providing
much
cherry
flavor
the
qualities
of
the
base
beer
are
good
the
tartness
is
mouth
puckering
12
oz
bottle
into
rogue
pint
glass
very
dark
syrupy
appearance
when
poured
light
brown

dissipates

label

this
drinks
more
like
cherry
juice
with
a
little
bit
of
stout
added
strong
sweet
cherry
syrup
taste
interesting
but
less
than
moderately
appealing
its
an
ok
beer
overall
this
one
just
doesnt
strike
my
fancy
the
cherry
comes
across
a
bit
fake
and
subtracts
more
than
it
adds
to
the
flavor
profile
thinking
it
would
be
better
as
a
regular
milk
stout
an
interesting
beer
the
cherry
flavor
needs
work
though
welp
that
does
it
for
the
longest
review
in
the
history
of
beeradvocate
cheers
o
found
it
very
interesting
use
of
tart
cherries
reminds
me
of
a
flanders
red
than
of
a
stout
still
a
pretty
good
beer
if
you
like
that
style
which
i
do
from
time
to
time
i
am
curious
how
this
one
does
with
age
like
a
good
lambic
would
the
fruit
age
gracefully
and
fade
into
the
background
lets
find
out
3
485

ocant
believe
im
saying
this
but
bells
really
missed
the
mark
the
balance
was
off
the
cherry
wasnt
where
it
should
have
been
o
i
just
cant
dig
this
stout
i
guess
cherries
dont
do
well
in
beer
for
me
but
admittedly
i
am
rather
partial
to
a
bitter
beer
o
bells
cherry
stout
holds
a
well
deserved
place
amongst
an
array
of
their
stout
releases
the
breweries
from
michigan
i
love
call
the
cold
months
stout
season
and
its
hard
to
argue
bells
dont
release
a
load
of
great
drinkable
stouts
for
winter
i
enjoy
cherry
stout
and
its
almost
a
tradition
for
my
friends
and
family
to
have
one
every
winter
its
like
an
american
stout
meets
sour
ale
with
them
walking
hand
in
hand
down
your
palate
with
the
cherries
only
being
there
for
flavor
and
not
to
just
pucker
you
up
cherry
stout
holds
a
place
in
my
heart
and
a
place
in
bells
winter
lineup
and
i
hope
it
remains
there
one
of
the
best
fruit
stouts
ever
made
overall
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
feels
is
pretty
typical
although
its
a
bit
carbonated
for
a
stout
super
silky
smooth
but
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
glad
i
tried
it
but
low
on
my
list
of
bells
beers
worth
a
try
but
i
prob
wont
give
it
another
shot
wont
dissuade
me
from
bells
though
cheers
o
damn
this
is
a
good
beer
one
is
enough
though
as
a
dessert
beer
its
hard
to
fault
while
its
really
only
great
in
the
right
mood
during
said
mood
it
hits
the
spot
fantastically
the
beer
is
smooth
and
drinkable
and
i
am
enjoying
it
throughout
the
sampling
quite
a
bit
of
a
coater
on
my
palate
and
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
12
of
these
in
a
night
but
it
is
fairly
enjoyable
overall
overall
an
interesting
cherry
stout
while
it
starts
out
with
a
decent
stout
flavor
cherry
is
really
the
dominating
taste
in
this
one
especially
at
the
end
where
it
almost
entirely
knocks
out
the
stout
flavors
while
it
is
not
a
brew
that
i
would
go
to
all
that
often
it
is
one
that
is
well
worth
a
try
stout
in
standard
pint
glass
hardly
any
foam
dark
dark
chocolate
cherry
color
and
taste

balanced
and

ever

love

when
poured
into
a
glass
not

from
the
bottle
beer
hopslam
forever
overall
i
liked
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
the
sour
cherry
thing
actually
proved
to
be
an
asset
in
my
opinion
it
sets
it
apart
from
other
stouts
id
buy
it
again
o
great
example
of
a
fruit
beer
where
the
fruit
can
really
stand
on
its
own
without
being
in
a
sour
and
theres
a
solid
stout
behind
it
to
boot
looking
forward
to
having
another
of
these
next
winter
tasted
slightly
better
as
it
warmed
and
wasnt
a
drainpour
yet
i
wont
be
buying
anymore
overall
i
love
cherries
and
i
love
stouts
but
i
cant
say
the
same
for
this
cherry
stout
the
cherries
are
almost
a
distraction
to
what
is
a
pretty
good
stout
still
a
decent
beer
but
i
would
prefer
to
try
just
the
base
beer
by
itself
tried
a
sampler
glass
mixed
5050
with
a
chocolate
stout
and
it
was
close
to
perfection
o
this
is
a
great
cherry
stout
it
is
pretty
simple
but
very
flavorful
let
it
sit
and
get
close
to
room
temp
to
max
out
the
flavor
overall
a
pretty
good
slow
sipper
one
would
be
enough
at
a
sitting
though
o
3
75
its
a
great
take
on
michigan
beer
average
beer
overall
o
an
interesting
beer
could
use
some
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
tart
i
guess
the
profile
im
really
looking
for
would
be
a
cherry
founders
breakfast
stout
missed
getting
this
beer
two
years
ago
and
last
year
they
didnt
brew
it
due
to
a
cherry
shortage
did
have
the
barrel
aged
version
and
have
to
say
that
is
far
superior
the
barrel
adds
the
vanilla
and
sugars
this
beer
needs
o
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
beer
as
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
from
a
naturally
flavored
stout
and
because
i
have
never
been
a
fan
of
chocolate
covered
cherries
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
is
something
i
would
have
again
o
nice
stout
but
one
is
enough
for
me
its
been
a
few
years
since
ive
had
this
and
although
it
was
a
bit
better
than
i
remember
its
not
something
id
buy
regularly
good
to
finally
come
back
to
though
overall
this
is
somewhat
disappointing
but
then
again
its
enjoyable
peculiar
o
while
this
is
a
great
idea
sour
cherries
in
a
stout
it
might
need
to
a
little
more
balance
between
the
tartness
of
the
cherries
and
some
sweeter
cherries
or
more
milk
chocolate
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
bodied
it
has
a
little
creaminess
which
i
absolutely
love
overall
i
very
much
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
one
its
much
different
than
other
fruit
blended
stouts
because
its
sour
instead
of
sweet
thoroughly
recommended
o
not
bad
tangy
michigan
cherries
nice
roast
flavor
not
too
complex
if
you
dont
like
cherries
you
really
wont
like
this
a
nice
beer
o
a
decent
stout
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
this
one
falls
short
of
the
excellent
stouts
expedition
black
note
double
cream
ect
that
bells
usually
does
as
much
as
i
love
cherries
here
they
are
too
overly
dominant
wish
more
of
the
classic
stout
flavors
where
there
if
the
cherries
were
toned
down
just
a
notch
this
one
could
be
damn
near
perfect
o
very
interesting
brew
i
would
recommend
this
but
not
sure
i
would
get
it
again
any
time
soon
nice
to
try
once

probably
will

surprised

in

taste

i
could
not

in

however
it
added
some

as
i

this
it
is
growing
on
me
im
not
a
big
over
the
top

person
given
it
is
a
cold

here
in

this
is
a

with
a

overall
a
poor
showing
from

i
expected
a
lot
from
this
one
especially
after

hiatus
last

but
the
strong
juice
taste
takes
away
from
what
this
beer
could
be

certainly
drinkable
but

straightforward
dark
beers
are
much
better

pleasantly
surprised
ive
gotta
a

more

ill
break
out
with
some
friends
over
the

well
as
this

has
held
up
over
the
course
of
the
last
2
years
i
dont
expect
that
to
continue

id
drink
this

polished

10
minutes
overall
i
love
the
aroma
of
this
beer
and
i
really
do
like
cherry
beers
in
general
i
find
this
to
be
a
delightful

really
does

think
that
most
people
wont
appreciate
the
cherry
influence
its
not
a
dessert
cherry
and
not
what
most
people
are
thinking
when
they
see
cherries
but
this
beer
is
a
great
reflection
of
michigan
they
did
very
well
indeed
bottle
from
sahara
mart
bloomington
in
pours
pitch
black
with
about
a
1
finger
reddishbrown
head
aroma
has
stout
characteristics
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
cherry
taste
has
none
of
the
chocolate
and
all
of
the
cherry
the
slight
carbonation
gives
a
smooth
sweet
texture
if
you
like
very
tart
stouts
then
this
beer
is
for
you
but
other
than
that
it
is
not
balanced
well
and
is
too
tart
for
a
sweet
stout
if
the
other
ingredients
could
come
through
this
would
be
an
above
average
beer
but
just
settles
for
average
a
mess
of
a
brew
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
but
it
was
just
too
off
from
what
it
represents
to
be
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
presents
no
heat
cant
quite
recommend
it
although
i
did
drink
it
and
kinda
enjoyed
it
thanks
for
sharing
adam
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
kind
of
presents
a
chocolate
covered
cherry
flavor
not
sure
if
id
go
for
this
again
but
a
new
experience
at
least
well
done
bells
impressive
o
good
beer
definitely
one
ill
try
again
its
a
different
take
and
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
1
at
a
sitting
but
the
unique
taste
was
one
i
enjoyed
ive
heard
some
people
describe
this
as
tasting
like
chocolate
covered
cherries
and
i
can
certainly
see
that
correlation
as
long
as
you
remember
it
is
a
beer
hiding
in
there
definitely
a
desertstyle
beer
and
one
that
i
could
really
see
myself
enjoying
with
a
piece
of
chocolate
cake
or
chocolate
dessert
overall
a
little
bit
more
carbonation
would
be
nice
and
maybe
a
touch
more
sweetness
the
taste
is
interesting
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
ripe
sweet
cherry
rather
than
a
tartness
glad
to
have
tried
but
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
again
had
this
one
on
tap
at
the
khyber
during
pbw
while
i
appreciate
the
attempt
this
one
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
this
was
the
2007
version
too
the
sour
cherries
def
come
through
but
add
a
little
unsettling
tart
funk
that
i
didnt
enjoy
glad
to
have
tried
it
though
overall
drinkable
enough
but
sort
of
an
experiment
that
didnt
fully
succeed
this
is
a
cherry
stout
not
a
stout
with
cherry
notes
o
the
initial
sourness
stuns
you
when
you
are
expecting
a
stout
and
isnt
the
best
flavor
otherwise
pretty
good
beer
drinkability
is
very
high
due
to
the
sour
combination
of
the
cherries
and
the
real
stout
flavor
at
7
abv
it
makes
a
robust
pairing
with
any
food
really
enjoyed
this
very
well
balance
with
and
excellent
flavor
profile
combining
an
outstanding
stout
with
cherry
tartness
highly
recommend
o
i
enjoy
this
i
think
its
a
good
fit
using
the
cherries
i
wish
though
it
was
a
lot
heavier
than
it
is
i
feel
the
juice
watered
down
the
beer
considerably
a
nice
find
at
the
world
of
beers
in
fort
myers
florida
this
one
is
a
pitch
black
brown
color
this
stout
carries
a
decent
chocolatetan
colored
cover
and
modest
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
unique
blend
of
tart
cherries
and
chocolatey
malt
pleasant
and
enticing
with
a
lemony
hint
the
flavor
brings
a
more
challenging
blend
of
bitter
cherries
with
charcoal
malt
with
very
little
chocolate
bitterness
really
takes
over
here
but
the
malt
base
remains
and
carries
a
modest
herbal
hop
tasty
but
takes
some
taste
bud
adjustments
medium
bodied
with
a
pretty
cohesive
feel
that
includes
a
bit
of
chalkiness
carbonation
is
very
subtle
but
a
bit
prickly
you
do
get
use
to
this
and
i
would
say
its
a
neat
unique
stout
worth
trying
i
like
this
beer
more
tartness
than
i
would
like
but
still
has
its
place
its
different
thats
for
sure
a
beautiful
dark
brown
pour
into
a
snifter
with
enough
room
for
the
dark
brown
head
to
rise
to
the
top
without
spilling
over
excellent
lacing
scents
of
cherries
maple
smokey
coffee
tobacco
a
bitter
roasty
flavor
with
a
touch
of
sourness
caramel
cherries
toasted
oats
and
grains
chocolate
coffee
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
constant
carbonation
creating
a
nice
fizzy
feeling
going
down
this
would
have
been
perfect
this
winter
but
seems
a
little
out
of
season
with
the
heat
rising
still
a
very
refreshing
fruity
stout
so
itll
be
ok
for
the
remainder
of
the
spring
season
im
glad
i
made
the
dive
and
spent
so
much
on
the
six
pack
edit
i
let
it
sit
for
about
6
weeks
and
found
it
much
more
palatable
ive
got
a
few
left
and
i
am
going
to
age
them
a
little
longer
o
a
fine
stout
the
balanced
roastychocolatecoffeecherry
aroma
is
rather
deceiving
as
the
taste
is
dominated
by
tart
cherries
not
bad
at
all
but
i
hoped
for
a
more
robust
balanced
beer
still
worth
trying
at
least
once
not
at
all
what
ive
experienced
as
a
cherry
stout
before
the
aroma
hides
the
tart
flavor
and
seems
to
indicate
a
much
more
sweet
malt
presence
interesting
but
a
bit
more
tart
dominant
than
i
initially
expected
i
like
it
much
more
as
it
warms
pours
a
dark
brownish
color
with
the
slightest
pink
tinge
to
an
otherwise
khaki
colored
head
aroma
of
sweet
cherries
and
roasted
malts
in
the
flavor
a
blend
of
roasted
malt
notes
mimicking
coffee
cocoa
and
mild
astringent
bitterness
paired
with
tart
cherry
flavor
interesting
how
tart
the
cherries
have
become
this
beer
was
aged
5
months
tart
sour
roasty
mildly
bitter
and
quite
tasty
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
overall
a
pretty
nice
stout
with
tart
cherry
flavor
solid
overall
this
beer
just
doesnt
work
i
must
say
that
the
sweet
and
tart
flavors
arent
as
out
of
balance
as
they
were
two
months
ago
when
i
tried
my
first
one
but
now
its
just
more
medicinal
i
dont
think
its
getting
any
better
as
it
ages
o
i
like
cherries
and
i
like
stouts
but
this
didnt
blend
well
not
bad
but
i
probably
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
a
day
one
of
my
least
favorite
bells
offerings
that
being
said
i
dont
often
think
the
addition
of
cherry
is
beneficial
to
most
stouts
cherry
stout
pours
a
very
dark
black
color
with
a
very
small
brown
head
there
is
a
dark
roasted
malty
coffee
like
smell
with
chocolate
notes
and
just
hints
of
a
tart
cherry
smell
the
flavor
starts
with
a
nice
roasted
malty
flavors
with
good
hints
of
chocolate
then
the
tart
cherries
flavors
kick
in
it
finishes
with
a
rather
tart
cherry
note
it
can
be
a
bit
hard
to
drink
the
after
taste
is
strong
and
doesnt
blend
well
overall
i
found
this
a
very
good
beer
you
must
love
cherries
to
enjoy
this
and
there
is
a
nice
complex
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
abrasive
and
doesnt
fit
well
but
there
is
a
moment
with
each
sip
that
all
the
flavors
mingle
and
make
this
beer
worth
it
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
and
very
tart
cherry
forward
stout
it
is
very
good
if
you
like
cherries
but
would
be
very
difficult
to
have
more
than
one
if
your
not
a
big
fan
of
tart
cherries
i
do
like
this
the
cherries
almost
yield
a
winelike
feel
but
many
may
not
want
to
session
something
like
this
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
tart
on
the
corners
and
sweet
up
front
the
flavors
are
interesting
but
not
a
combo
that
i
particularly
enjoy
i
had
enough
after
a
bottle
and
wont
be
going
back
for
more
not
bad
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
though
overall
i
think
theres
a
really
good
stout
under
there
the
cherry
does
more
harm
than
good
o
not
my
favorite
offering
from
bells
too
bad
since
i
had
it
on
cask
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
was
blown
away
im
still
not
blown
away
but
i
am
intrigued
by
the
wine
similarities
your
wine
drinking
friends
might
like
it
it
still
costs
a
little
too
much
but
if
you
really
want
to
reel
a
certain
wino
pal
of
yours
into
the
beer
sphere
this
might
prove
a
sufficient
lure
o
its
a
mysterious
dance
alright
combining
this
one
with
some
chocolatecovered
coffee
beans
seemed
to
cut
through
the
tartness
a
little
still
pretty
overwhelming
but
a
beer
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
try
o
overall
i
think
a
person
could
get
some
enjoyment
out
of
the
malt
sweetness
but
the
fruit
flavor
has
an
alarmingly
pungent
flavor
that
is
offputting
not
really
the
same
as
what
i
get
from
lambics
but
just
off
i
dont
recommend
the
beer
o
this
was
not
a
favorite
of
mine
it
could
be
that
i
just
dont
like
cherries
but
wow
this
stuff
is
sour
i
have
had
other
cherry
flavored
beers
such
as
mad
elf
and
quite
enjoyed
it
but
the
cherry
in
this
beer
i
find
to
be
overpowering
the
combination
of
the
cherry
and
the
stout
iness
remind
me
of
cough
syrup
o
a
strange
stout
like
someone
dumped
a
bit
of
wine
into
a
heavy
porterlight
stout
pours
a
dark
brown
with
extremely
small
tanoffwhite
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
bit
of
vegetable
aroma
and
some
cherry
hints
of
vanilla
and
coffee
as
well
taste
is
chocolate
with
some
coffee
and
burnt
malt
there
is
also
some
tart
cherry
flavor
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
tart
kinda
like
the
cherry
stout
collab
from
stone
mouthfeel
is
kinda
light
borderline
medium
drinkability
is
fair
overall
this
beer
is
somewhat
strange
i
love
sourstart
beers
and
i
love
rich
dark
beers
i
also
love
beers
that
fall
safely
between
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
fit
in
the
safely
between
category
still
an
okay
beer
though
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
i
think
i
may
like
the
concept
of
a
cherry
stout
more
than
the
actual
cherry
stouts
i
have
tried
this
one
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
potential
but
it
needs
some
more
balance
between
the
cherry
and
the
malts
overall
pretty
disappointed
in
this
brew
i
was
hoping
for
more
complexity
and
this
brew
is
overpriced
imo
everything
seems
to
be
lacking
except
for
the
tarty
cherries
overall
not
bad
interesting
overall
a
tasty
cherry
stout
the
cerry
is
very
prevalent
in
the
taste
but
subtle
in
the
aroma
drinkability
is
good
i
love
cherries
and
id
say
this
is
a
okay
use
but
this
isnt
something
i
could
drink
alot
of
due
to
the
tart
sourness
its
not
really
something
im
used
to
identifying
with
a
stout
still
overall
its
very
solid
though
not
a
stout
i
think
id
return
to
except
for
on
occasion
the
cherries
definitely
shine
through
but
they
never
dominate
the
craft
of
the
drink
though
it
might
wear
a
bit
thin
by
the
end
of
the
drink
if
youre
not
into
cherries
or
tart
flavors
overall
this
beer
isnt
a
cherrybomb
its
not
a
sweet
syrupy
fruit
beer
and
in
my
experience
its
not
going
to
be
the
gateway
kind
of
beer
for
nonbeer
drinkers
i
had
this
at
a
party
and
was
careful
to
share
sips
with
others
curious
about
it
who
were
expecting
something
lighter
fruiter
and
sweeter
by
suggesting
they
smell
it
think
of
dark
cherries
and
let
it
warm
this
is
a
real
treat
of
a
brew
and
im
glad
i
can
enjoy
it
to
the
extent
that
i
do
o
the
cherry
dominates
the
stout
a
bit
much
and
the
stout
component
itself
is
rather
unimpressive
but
its
a
unique
and
moderately
tasty
beer
overall
o
an
ok
dessert
beer
but
the
cherry
flavor
doesnt
taste
as
if
its
fully
integrated
with
the
base
beer
giving
two
flavors
that
just
seem
to
lie
on
top
of
one
another
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
puckering
from
the
tannins
cherry
skin
and
barley
husk
come
to
mind
although
the
overall
effect
is
nice
this
beer
drinks
smoothly
and
i
enjoyed
it
o
i
like
this
beer
but
i
think
itd
be
even
better
with
a
better
balance
of
the
cherries
and
other
flavors
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
black
body
with
a
little
brown
head
that
goes
away
quickly
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
of
cherries
and
a
hint
of
chocloate
the
taste
upfront
is
tart
of
the
cherries
then
the
roasted
malts
come
next
and
then
at
the
end
on
the
back
of
the
tonuge
is
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
mouth
feel
is
really
good
rolls
off
the
tongue
nice
overall
this
is
a
really
good
stoudt
o
this
is
a
tasty
cherry
stout
from
bells
i
would
probably
drink
more
of
them
if
they
were
available
but
was
glad
to
have
received
this
in
a
trade
from
scoot69
thanks
again
o
decent
stuff
i
had
it
as
an
aperitif
of
sorts
after
some
time
outside
in
the
cold
and
it
worked
to
wake
up
the
taste
buds
and
warm
the
belly
but
a
bit
too
tart
overall
to
get
a
higher
score
overall
this
stout
has
a
nice
smooth
rich
cherry
taste
the
drinkability
is
phenomenal
very
well
balanced
and
delicious
15
for
a
sick
pack
worth
it
cheers
pours
a
super
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
beautiful
one
finger
dark
chocolate
head
average
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
the
nose
is
chocolate
cherry
malt
and
some
funk
not
bad
the
taste
is
interesting
a
little
heavy
on
the
sour
cherry
and
a
little
light
on
the
chocolatemalt
still
its
pretty
good
feel
is
super
smooth
w
the
malt
backbone
vs
tart
w
the
cherries
nice
overall
a
solid
brew
if
it
was
a
little
bit
more
balanced
this
would
be
a
great
beer
o
ive
been
waiting
a
year
for
this
and
i
am
not
disappointed
very
good
and
very
interesting
m
it
actually
feels
like
drinking
cherry
juice
in
the
way
that
its
lightly
astringent
and
cleanses
the
palate
dont
get
me
wrong
a
great
body
for
a
stout
mediumtofull
bodied
and
a
noticeable
carbonation
becomes
a
bit
too
bitter
and
cloying
once
the
beers
warms
but
still
drinkable
i
cant
get
over
how
cherry
the
taste
and
feel
are
its
very
unique
for
the
style
but
i
guess
my
expectations
were
too
specific
very
typical
of
bells
to
transcend
the
style
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
though
overall
i
love
this
beer
and
will
gladly
purchase
it
again
another
home
run
for
bells
stouts
d
its
a
tasty
beer
but
not
the
most
drinkable
one
it
may
be
the
cherries
for
me
just
too
odd
4

d
this
accomplishes
what
i
imagine
the
goal
was
in
creating
this
brew
solid
taste
solid
overall
cherries
are
well
incorportated
o
a
fine
beer
an
interesting
cherry
thing
and
a
nice
balance
this
beer
was
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
which
is
to
say
it
was
alright
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
it
looks
good
on
the
pour
dark
and
a
nice
head
that
diminished
over
time
and
left
just
a
little
lacing
it
smells
of
cherry
predominantly
i
served
it
fairly
cold
and
it
was
enjoyable
more
cherries
came
out
as
it
warmed
up
which
i
let
happen
to
get
that
aspect
of
the
beer
but
i
actually
preferred
the
more
subtle
cherry
flavor
when
it
was
cold
before
the
cherry
started
dominating
i
got
some
chocolate
and
more
heavy
malt
but
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
now
that
the
cherries
are
kicking
me
in
the
teeth
thats
really
all
im
pulling
out
of
this
one
its
a
fun
beer
to
drink
but
as
i
said
earlier
i
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
overall
i
liked
this
but
really
didnt
love
it
i
think
brewing
with
cherries
is
a
great
idea
but
this
one
was
brewed
with
cherry
juice
and
i
think
that
takes
it
way
out
over
the
top
too
tart
for
me
i
like
to
taste
roasted
flavors
in
my
stouts
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
just
pick
a
bottle
like
i
did
pours
black
with
a
hint
of
a
reddish
hue
not
much
head
on
this
beer
slight
hint
of
cherry
and
roasted
malts
in
the
aroma
not
much
else
and
not
too
strong
flavor
begins
with
tart
and
distinct
cherry
juice
flavor
tastes
a
bit
artificial
and
borders
on
sour
a
slight
roasted
malt
adds
a
much
needed
counter
to
the
cherry
with
hints
of
coco
a
little
bit
of
metallic
flavor
but
cant
really
say
it
distracts
from
the
overall
enjoyment
its
very
cherry
dominated
and
tart
if
you
dont
like
that
dont
venture
forth
unto
this
beer
its
really
what
its
all
about
usual
coffee
and
chocolate
suspects
stay
well
behind
the
cover
provided
by
the
cherry
definitely
interesting
and
different
but
could
be
better
nice
job
bells
overall
it
was
not
bad
just
nothing
there
to
balance
the
sourness
i
finished
the
glass
feeling
just
a
little
disappointed
as
i
really
looked
forward
to
this
offering
from
bells
will
try
it
again
another
time
lots
of
cherries
very
fruity
malty
background
is
a
bit
lost
but
you
still
know
it
is
a
darker
brew
than
most
fruit
beers
many
stout
characters
are
not
present
here
roasty
coffee
burnt
toast
and
chocolate
all
seem
to
be
pretty
m
i
a
the
fruitiness
is
just
a
bit
much
and
i
love
a
good
fruit
beer
it
falls
somewhere
in
the
netherrealm
of
a
tart
sour
a
sweet
fruit
beer
and
a
export
stout
but
never
commits
to
any
of
them
to
the
beers
detrimenton
my
palate
at
least
i
am
glad
i
got
this
as
a
single
instead
of
a
whole
sixer
and
would
not
seek
it
out
again
its
not
bad
but
is
a
bit
overpowering
an
after
dinner
type
drink
beer
if
you
ask
me
moreys
bottom
line
i
have
a
few
problems
with
this
beer
its
too
thin
its
undercarbonated
and
theres
too
much
juice
imo
so
much
so
that
it
really
doesnt
taste
all
that
much
like
beer
on
the
back
end
overall
an
interesting
mix
of
bright
and
sweet
cherries
and
dark
malts
would
go
well
with
a
piece
of
cherry
cake
or
pie
overall
this
is
a
decent
stout
but
i
find
the
tart
cherries
to
be
very
distracting
form
what
i
want
out
of
a
stout
o
this
beer
would
have
benefitted
either
from
more
cherry
flavor
without
adding
more
tart
or
toning
it
down
more
as
it
stands
it
came
across
just
as
a
tart
stout
without
the
vibrant
fruit
flavor
i
hoped
for
o
nice
if
you
like
real
cherry
juice
and
stouts
its
a
great
marriage
taste
is
good
but
not
really
something
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
a
great
fruity
stout
so
yes
technically
this
is
a
sound
beer
but
if
you
are
expecting
to
taste
something
a
little
different
this
one
will
probably
let
you
down
in
that
category
overall
a
lil
too
sweet
but
a
very
well
done
beer
would
have
to
be
in
a
specific
mood
to
enjoy
one
again
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
rich
looking
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
head
faded
and
doesnt
really
lace
the
glass
all
too
much
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
roasted
and
has
a
tart
cherry
aroma
coming
off
of
it
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
sweet
cherry
but
either
way
you
can
tell
there
will
be
some
cherry
in
there
the
flavor
if
the
beer
is
just
a
little
off
in
my
opinion
i
was
thinking
that
this
would
have
gone
better
together
but
i
felt
the
cherry
was
just
a
little
too
tart
for
me
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
light
side
also
which
hindered
my
thoughts
on
this
beer
too
overall
this
brew
was
fun
to
try
but
i
havent
really
got
much
desire
to
have
it
again
o
it
isnt
all
that
drinkable
the
sweetness
while
headed
off
by
the
tart
cherries
and
roastiness
is
undeniable
and
sort
of
takes
over
after
a
while
strange
aftertaste
pitch
black
head
with
browntan
head
smell
of
tart
cherries
maybe
slight
chocolate
but
that
may
be
my
mind
playing
tricks
on
me
by
its
appearance
taste
is
tart
cherries
and
smoke
this
was
a
lot
more
sourtart
than
i
was
expecting
slight
chocolate
taste
mouthfeel
is
way
too
watery
for
a
stout
for
me
this
was
the
them
most
disappointing
aspect
of
this
brew
for
me
overall
its
interesting
but
i
would
pass
on
it
next
time
around
o
very
enjoyable
stout
a
bit
more
malty
than
i
prefer
excellent
use
of
the
fruit
component
blends
very
well
with
the
stout
without
overpowering
overall
i
dont
like
the
addition
of
the
cherry
juice
to
this
i
think
it
overpowers
the
malts
of
the
stout
and
ruins
the
taste
not
a
huge
fan
overall
strong
flavors
but
wellbalanced
for
what
it
is
o
this
beer
just
does
not
do
it
for
me
the
tartness
of
the
cherries
is
there
but
the
flavor
does
not
come
though
enough
for
me
i
feel
that
the
cherries
either
need
to
make
more
of
an
appearance
or
not
be
in
the
beer
at
all
overall
traditional
stout
base
with
lots
of
cherry
infused
into
it
at
all
levels
strong
alcohol
feel
and
taste
which
is
surprising
since
it
is
a
low
abv
beer
more
of
an
opaque
brown
than
black
if
i
can
get
away
with
saying
that
bubbly
light
coffee
head
that
stays
strong
aroma
of
booze
slight
cherry
earth
medicinal
notes
and
raisins
dark
chocolate
and
sharp
cinnamon
whoa
chocolate
tangy
and
sour
fruit
cherry
purée
booze
and
rides
sharp
tang
to
the
finish
heavy
in
body
and
light
in
carbonation
the
cherries
are
a
bit
strong
here
and
personally
would
like
it
more
as
an
accent
in
the
drink
rather
than
being
at
the
forefront
pours
out
a
dark
brown
hue
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
maintains
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
nose
has
a
strong
cherry
aroma
with
some
chocolate
and
sweet
malts
in
the
back
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
in
which
the
cherries
over
takes
everything
the
cherry
taste
stays
through
out
and
in
the
aftertaste
i
do
get
some
chocolate
coffee
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
back
everything
is
well
balanced
but
the
cherries
was
a
bit
too
much
i
think
it
would
have
been
better
with
a
little
less
cherries
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
easy
drinking
and
if
you
like
a
strong
cherry
taste
in
your
stout
than
this
is
the
beer
for
you
o
im
all
for
adding
fruit
to
a
stout
but
it
would
be
nice
to
pick
up
more
on
the
malts
without
all
the
sour
cherry
taking
over
i
love
a
good
sour
beer
but
not
when
im
expecting
a
nice
rich
deep
complex
roasty
and
malty
stout
overall
a
great
beer
given
it
incorporates
fruit
but
im
not
sure
how
it
works
singularly
as
a
stout
the
interplay
of
cherry
and
malt
flavor
alone
makes
this
worth
drinking
and
almost
makes
it
a
lower
gravity
dessert
beer
if
you
werent
into
drinking
an
eisbock
i
aged
this
bottle
for
a
year
and
while
it
liked
it
better
fresh
this
is
still
a
great
one
for
a
cold
night
certainly
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
from
bells
but
still
worthy
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
chewy
on
the
tongue
this
smells
delicious
but
the
overwhelming
tart
cherry
became
a
turn
off
for
me
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
sour
cherry
taste
mixed
with
the
dark
chocolate
aftertaste
moutfeel
is
pretty
good
im
not
the
best
judge
for
this
category
it
honestly
felt
like
a
lot
of
other
stouts
by
bells
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
more
often
so
will
have
to
get
lucky
at
ashlys
or
make
a
trip
out
to
bells
when
its
on
tap
at
the
eccentric
cafe
overall
its
good
but
the
pieces
dont
really
come
together
it
also
has
a
bit
of
bite
that
brings
it
down
a
notch
for
me
not
bad
but
not
great
smells
slightly
of
cherries
but
mostly
hidden
by
the
strong
chocolate
malt
smell
it
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
fizzy
brown
head
that
settles
quickly
it
tastes
a
bit
sour
from
the
cherry
juice
and
that
is
followed
by
a
sweet
chocolate
taste
smooth
on
the
palate
but
it
is
a
bit
heavy
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
more
of
and
i
would
like
to
see
if
it
is
a
bit
better
on
tap
drinkability
more
of
a
sipping
beer
that
opens
up
once
it
hits
45
degree
overall
a
good
stout
but
in
my
opinion
nothing
spectacular
overall
good
beer
overall
not
my
favorite
but
the
cherry
adds
an
interesting
element
worth
a
shot
o
very
impressed
with
this
beer
the
massive
domination
of
the
cherries
are
the
only
thing
wrong
if
not
so
tart
and
a
little
sweeter
and
more
hidden
this
would
be
a
truly
awesome
beer
o
not
my
favorite
stout
happy
to
be
able
to
try
it
considering
bells
does
not
distribute
here
i
doubt
i
would
ever
get
it
again
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
received
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
poured
with
a
nearly
nonexistent
head
despite
a
fairly
vigorous
pour
the
nose
starts
off
with
a
faint
cherry
scent
fast
forward
to
the
taste
and
its
all
cherry
all
the
time
big
bold
sour
cherry
this
is
like
a
sour
stout
mouthfeel
is
very
tart
this
ones
hard
to
retain
intake
swallow
repeat
the
longer
its
in
your
mouth
the
more
twisted
and
contorted
your
face
is
sure
to
become
overall
this
is
average
at
best
wouldnt
make
an
effort
to
revisit
and
might
not
drink
if
it
was
the
only
beer
option
interesting
nonetheless
and
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
this
is
definitely
the
tartest
stout
ive
ever
had
its
a
unique
brew
that
one
could
order
to
mix
things
up
later
in
a
drinking
session
i
generally
like
rounder
roastier
maltiersweeter
stouts
but
this
one
was
an
enjoyable
change
o
although
not
my
favorite
stout
this
brew
has
me
interested
in
cherry
stouts
even
when
i
didnt
think
i
would
enjoy
them
o
this
is
a
treat
to
be
appreciated
in
the
wrong
tasting
context
or
with
an
expectation
of
a
different
experience
it
would
be
easy
to
write
off
this
brew
as
a
creators
indulgence
however
i
was
lucky
enough
to
taste
after
a
late
summer
meal
of
fresh
vegatables
and
only
ipas
to
influence
my
palate
i
taste
and
imagine
this
brew
and
its
ingrediants
all
mellowed
from
time
stored
in
american
oak
barrels
a
beer
perfectly
suited
for
a
last
of
the
night
choice
esp
in
the
context
of
slow
and
relective
evaluation
of
events
of
the
day
and
this
brew
demonstrates
the
top
capability
of
a
very
experienced
brewer
i
dont
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
expected
to
i
guess
cherry
juice
roasted
malts
too
much
acid
if
i
reframe
it
as
a
sour
beer
its
a
little
more
palatable
but
too
roasty
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
oh
well
not
an
awful
beer
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
overall
i
put
this
akin
to
my
first
experience
with
brooklyn
black
chocolate
stout
its
all
tobacco
and
burnt
theres
a
chance
ill
love
it
in
a
few
years
but
right
now
its
a
charred
mess
its
definitely
unique
but
its
not
the
strongest
beer
in
bells
lineup
not
by
far
overall
this
sure
seems
like
a
big
miss
for
bells
this
is
one
that
should
be
dropped
from
their
lineup
imo
this
took
some
effort
to
finish
o
interesting
brew
if
i
look
at
it
from
my
wild
alesour
loving
perspective
this
is
definitely
an
ok
beer
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
stoutee
and
didnt
get
that
at
all
its
a
confused
brew
not
quite
sour
but
not
quite
a
stout
if
you
like
roasted
sour
cherries
give
it
a
go
i
probably
wont
be
trading
for
it
any
time
soon
though
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
overall
im
surprised
to
say
that
i
really
liked
this
beer
since
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
cherries
the
tartness
from
the
cherries
really
blends
well
with
the
roasted
malts
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
purchase
this
on
a
regular
basis
highly
recommend
you
try
if
you
have
the
chance
o
one
is
enough
with
the
intensity
of
tart
cherry
12
ounce
bottle
shared
at
the
july
santa
cruz
tasting
pours
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
aroma
is
chocolatey
but
sort
of
salty
too
like
uh
those
salted
chocolates
a
touch
of
soy
and
smoke
coffee
and
a
mild
cherry
tartness
flavor
is
dark
chocolate
and
cherry
juice
with
a
nice
dry
finish
pours
black
and
syrupy
with
a
small
dark
brown
head
and
a
minimum
of
lace
some
sediment
is
present
smell
is
roasty
and
a
bit
of
smoke
with
a
ton
of
cherry
the
malty
stout
aroma
floats
in
the
middle
taste
is
smoky
roast
on
the
front
with
some
minimal
sweetness
in
the
middle
with
bittersweet
sour
cherry
at
the
finish
tartness
is
a
bit
of
a
shock
but
grows
on
you
quickly
very
complex
slippery
mouthfeel
with
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
actually
the
cherry
is
very
tart
throughout
aftertaste
is
sour
cherry
and
lots
of
smoky
bitterness
this
is
not
your
girly
fruit
beer
the
taste
is
complex
and
smoky
and
the
cherry
is
bitterly
tart
this
cries
out
for
a
bold
smoky
ham
sandwich
with
sharp
cheddar
o
the
tartness
on
the
nose
was
nice
and
added
some
depth
but
it
really
took
over
on
the
palate
and
became
too
much
overall
exciting
fruit
stout
good
for
lambicflemish
fans
drinking
this
beer
made
me
think
of
black
forest
cake
since
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
black
forest
cake
this
did
not
bode
well
for
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
if
you
can
handle
the
clash
of
tartness
and
richness
youll
like
this
beer
personally
the
cherry
tartness
just
didnt
quite
work
for
me
i
wont
buy
this
again
drink
and
overall
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
stout
on
tap
this
beer
does
not
age
well
in
a
bottle
for
whatever
reason
the
cherry
fades
and
turns
into
an
unappealing
mess
but
fresh
on
tap
its
a
work
of
art
i
really
enjoy
what
bells
has
done
pours
black
just
doesnt
look
very
thick
reddish
gold
lacing
smells
of
tart
cherries
dark
chocolate
roasts
and
a
bit
of
coffee
first
taste
has
coffee
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
sweet
cherry
however
when
i
swallow
im
overwhelmed
with
tart
cherry
different
kind
of
stout
than
what
im
used
to
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
a
bit
thin
not
much
carbonation
the
cherry
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
tart
but
not
overly
tart
i
catch
quite
a
bit
of
chocolate
on
the
aftertaste
as
well
overall
this
wasnt
bad
not
sure
ill
buy
it
again
but
not
bad
dark
black
pour
with
a
thin
gray
head
potent
aroma
of
cherries
that
yields
a
light
cherry
cough
syrup
taste
the
cherries
are
prevalent
enough
to
tell
these
are
very
likely
real
cherries
and
pretty
fresh
a
bit
too
much
malt
black
patent
for
my
taste
though
the
alcohol
comes
a
bit
to
hard
and
bitter
but
still
well
worth
trying
d
no
carbonation
at
all
oily
in
the
mouth
overall
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
its
one
for
the
books
as
they
say
something
to
try
but
if
you
like
cherries
and
stouts
its
all
for
you
i
used
a
very
gentle
pour
as
i
was
concerned
that
lees
may
have
formed
over
time
i
am
unsure
that
it
mattered
however
as
there
was
very
little
carbonation
present
and
even
a
vigorous
swirl
failed
to
produce
any
head
color
was
an
opaque
black
srm
44
with
only
some
cola
highlights
visible
at
the
edges
nose
was
filled
with
the
scent
of
dried
tart
cherries
slightly
medicinal
but
still
pleasant
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
and
without
carbonation
as
i
had
previously
mentioned
this
allowed
the
tartness
of
the
cherries
to
really
shine
and
i
feel
as
though
i
have
come
a
long
way
since
my
original
review
i
did
not
find
it
to
be
at
all
unpleasant
instead
i
liked
the
way
the
cherries
had
really
come
to
the
forefront
especially
since
i
was
not
getting
much
in
the
way
of
the
dark
malts
finish
remained
tart
but
not
puckering
it
was
an
interesting
experiment
to
be
sure
but
i
am
coming
to
the
realization
that
fresher
probably
would
have
been
better
my
last
pour
was
that
of
the
lees
agitated
back
into
suspension
this
last
bit
was
much
more
tart
than
the
rest
which
is
worth
noting
o
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
could
be
an
excellent
beer
if
the
cherry
were
a
little
more
subtle
but
i
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
o
i
wish
this
was
a
little
more
roasty
and
had
some
better
balance
a
little
too
cherry
forward
definitely
a
sour
tart
cherry
flavor
but
i
like
sour
beers
so
the
sourness
did
not
bother
me
but
the
chocolate
and
espresso
background
got
lost
some
if
this
tasted
more
like
the
aroma
this
could
be
great
personal
opinion
only
i
still
prefer
my
local
wildrose
cherry
porter
wish
i
could
have
tried
them
side
by
side
overall
i
enjoyed
it
although
the
flavor
profile
did
not
provide
the
depth
that
the
aroma
provided
it
was
still
enjoyable
pours
black
with
a
finger
of
dark
khaki
foam
decent
retention
but
no
lacing
aroma
is
a
nicely
balanced
dark
chocolatecocoa
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
cherry
fruit
smells
tasty
the
taste
opens
with
a
burst
of
tart
mouthwatering
cherry
which
slowly
fades
over
a
good
30
secondsimpressive
if
it
were
balanced
with
other
stouty
flavors
but
it
turns
out
like
cherry
juice
i
do
get
some
cocoa
on
the
finish
which
turns
out
to
be
better
than
the
beer
itself
carbonation
is
low
too
low
for
the
style
overall
the
nice
aroma
got
my
hopes
up
but
this
beer
doesnt
avoid
the
trap
common
to
cherry
stouts
of
hamhandedness
over
subtlety
pours
pitch
black
with
almost
no
head
at
all
nose
is
somewhat
muted
but
along
the
lines
of
guinness
or
murphys
stout
palate
is
somewhat
tart
but
mostly
just
tastes
roast
and
like
coffee
molasses
and
malta
sounds
more
interesting
than
it
actually
tastes
cherry
does
manage
to
not
seem
artificial
which
is
a
plus
and
the
beer
is
bells
cherry
stout
2
for
2
guessing
beers
when
i
know
the
brewery
now
otherwise
ive
been
off
thanks
a
lot
kyle
this
is
a
beer
that
should
have
been
on
my
wants
list
very
thick
dark
brown
in
color
with
thin
but
lasting
head
the
scent
was
full
of
malt
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
cherry
which
was
much
more
present
in
the
taste
tart
cherry
dominated
the
taste
following
an
initial
chocolaty
smoothness
overall
this
was
an
excellent
beer
and
it
makes
an
great
dessert
drink
overall
wow
you
have
to
try
this
stout
to
enjoy
it
not
sure
i
would
name
this
a
fruitvegetable
beer
because
it
definitely
has
the
attributes
of
an
american
stout
drinkability
was
decent
but
wouldnt
drink
more
than
2
in
a
night
perfect
beer
with
a
chocolate
cheesecake
or
dessert
will
be
promoting
this
beer
without
a
doubt
overall
decent
but
certainly
not
worth
the
hefty
pricetag
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
the
smell
is
good
enough
lots
of
tart
cherries
but
not
much
else
works
for
me
very
light
on
the
mouthfeel
and
the
taste
lingers
but
i
dont
care
for
the
taste
it
has
a
medicinal
taste
and
not
in
a
good
sizzurpy
kind
of
way
it
is
very
light
for
a
stout
and
i
dont
think
i
would
purchase
this
again
in
a
word
meh
o
decent
but
too
sour
for
me
3
5
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
small
whispy
head
smells
pretty
interesting
but
not
overly
appetizing
roasted
grains
chocolate
and
cherry
that
is
somewhat
medicinal
palate
is
basically
the
same
as
the
nose
with
more
of
the
tart
cough
syrup
flavor
very
fluid
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
seems
a
bit
too
thin
and
watery
for
a
stout
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
but
could
be
worth
a
try
if
cherry
flavor
is
your
thing
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
bell
i
get
what
they
were
going
for
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
do
it
for
me
the
blend
of
tart
cherries
and
malty
coffee
just
doesnt
seem
to
work
right
off
the
bat
the
beer
looks
great
but
the
nose
and
taste
leave
something
to
be
desired
if
there
was
a
little
more
sweetness
to
the
beer
to
balance
out
the
tart
that
might
help
tart
and
bitter
in
this
case
not
a
great
combo
note
not
sure
how
fresh
this
beer
is
could
be
affecting
some
of
the
tartness
im
getting
out
of
this
beer
served
from
bottle
into
goblet
at
refrigerator
temperature
pours
jet
black
with
an
appropriatly
thick
brown
head
the
aroma
is
quite
subtle
and
doesnt
offer
much
of
a
hint
to
the
large
flavor
to
come
a
flavor
which
is
dominated
by
tart
michigan
cherries
the
cherry
flavor
which
is
quite
authentic
and
doesnt
resemble
cough
syrup
or
candy
at
all
is
far
and
away
the
most
dominant
flavor
in
this
brew
the
flavor
is
more
adult
than
other
massmarket
cherry
beers
owing
much
to
the
tart
cherries
but
is
still
very
cherry
indeed
although
very
tasty
i
believe
that
the
best
use
of
this
beer
is
in
cooking
this
is
not
a
complaint
this
would
make
a
great
component
to
a
sweet
dessert
for
drinking
though
it
would
be
tough
to
drink
more
than
one
but
the
quality
is
quite
evident
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
this
one
o
its
interesting
and
well
crafted
i
like
the
deep
roasted
stout
flavor
but
the
cherry
tartness
and
sweetness
was
a
bit
strong
good
beer
nonetheless
o
ok
i
buy
this
occasionally
its
interesting
to
try
i
like
sour
stouts
so
this
is
more
up
my
alley
but
it
cant
hold
a
candle
to
madrugada
obscura
o
a
very
surprising
failure
from
bells
overall
i
just
didnt
like
the
way
this
one
came
together
the
roast
and
the
tart
fruit
kept
fighting
for
my
attention
poured
into
a
pint
glass
not
a
lot
of
head
just
less
than
one
finger
of
tan
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
of
black
cherries
and
roasted
cold
coffee
beans
the
favor
plays
rigth
into
the
smell
subtle
cherryblackberry
favor
drying
winey
note
that
reminds
me
of
the
use
of
real
fruit
when
i
brew
the
alochol
is
hidden
but
there
just
seems
something
missing
still
a
good
brew
it
pours
black
with
a
reddishbrown
twofinger
head
thats
slow
to
fall
when
cold
the
nose
is
a
bit
difficult
to
distinguish
as
it
warms
the
aromas
of
tart
cherries
and
bittersweet
chocolate
are
apparent
this
is
definitely
another
sipping
beer
the
cherry
flavor
is
strong
and
tart
far
from
the
oversweetened
brew
i
expected
its
roasty
and
malty
with
a
nice
bitter
chocolate
coffee
finish
but
its
a
bit
too
carbonated
i
am
inclined
to
marinate
pork
in
this
one
completely
opaque
dark
brown
syrupy
looking
on
the
pour
almost
no
head
but
what
there
is
looks
like
espresso
foam
smells
a
bit
tart
with
alcohol
on
the
nose
but
the
smell
is
surprisingly
weak
the
flavor
is
very
interesting
and
hard
to
pin
down
whether
its
good
or
kind
of
bad
i
guess
it
depends
on
your
mood
the
positives
are
a
sweet
chocolaty
tart
cherry
medley
which
makes
this
come
off
as
a
dessert
beer
if
there
is
such
a
thing
the
downside
is
it
can
lean
towards
a
cough
syrup
flavor
and
consistency
so
not
good
there
but
it
plays
tricks
on
my
tasting
facilities
one
sip
is
hey
this
is
pretty
good
and
the
next
is
no
its
not
my
thing
a
strange
brew
with
a
little
bit
of
smoke
or
ash
im
not
getting
cherries
at
all
in
the
nose
the
taste
2011

543perhaps
these
arent
the
right
cherries
for
this
beer
their
sourness
makes
this
feel
less
a
cherry
stout
and
more
a
lactoinfected
mess
i
finished
the
glass
and
bittersweet
chocolate
on
the
finish
there
is
an

this

wow
but
the
flavor
definitely
fits
the
bill
enjoyable
and
drinkable
reminiscent
of
marchiano
cherries
some
warmth
from
the
alcohol
but
not
in

felt
like
the
beer
was
just
to

that

age

this

the
finish

unpleasant
tart
though
not
quite
as
overthetop
tart
to
me
as
some
of
the
other
reviewers
here
mentioned
wish
there
was
a
heavy
chocolate
flavor
as
that
may
have
really
meshed
with
the
other
flavors
well
and
pulled
this
up
to

here
finally
having
picked
some
up
driving
through
philly
i
was
excited
to
finally
try
one
of
their
brews
this
poured
out
black
with
some
red
highlights
and
now
head
at
all
the
pour
was
not
light
either
almost
black
being
a
meld
of
tastes
ranging
from
perfumy
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
not
much
to
the
mouthfeel

taste
and
there
is
tart
acidity
from
the
cherries
still
i
think
a
good
stout
lies
underneath
but
not
as
much
as
id
like
in
a
stout
drinkability
is
decent
at
first
reminiscent
of
the
traverse
city
cherry
festival
body
is
more
medium
than
full
alcohol
becomes
a
bit
apparent
in
the
finish
but
isnt
too
noticeable
a
delicious
stout
from
bells
although
a
failed
one
or
maybe
some
percentage
of
sweet
cherries
i
really
wanted
to
like
cherry
stout
and
feel
that
with
a
few
tweaks
here
and
there
this
is
a
middleoftheroad
fruit
beer
the
sour
aspect
of
the
cherry
juice
added
with
the
bitterness
imparted
by
the
hops
and
dark
malt
overwhelm
the
sweeter
nature
of
the
beer
i
just
kept
tasting
what
i
would
say
was
fermented
prune
juice
and
i
honestly
have
not
tried
fermenting
prune
juice
but
imagine
this
is
kind
of
what
it
would
taste
like
i
must
admit
creamy
in
its
texture
and
the
color
a
dark
chocolate
brown
and
my
thanks
to
tavernjef
for
his
supplying
me
with
this
bottle
gusleraug

and
a
tart
cherry
aroma
come
through
in
the
nose
my
lips
puckered
upon
my
first
sip
of
this
but
the
cherries
add
a
nice
flavor

o
delicious
stuff
like
i
said
who
can
turn
down
a
mocha
milkshake
i
definitely
never
would
easily
the
best
coffee
stout
ive
tried
and
it
is
probably
the
best
non
ba
stout
ive
tried
one
of
my
top
10
favorite
beers
cant
recommend
this
highly
enough
the
only
reason
why
this
doesnt
get
a
perfect
5
is
because
good
morning
exists
and
this
beer
can
somehow
be
improved
upon
the
smell
is
out
of
this
world
only
can
really
compare
it
to
a
fresh
2013
bcbcs
without
the
bourbon
this
is
what
a
big
coffee
stout
should
smell
like
incredible
smooth
taste
with
balanced
sweetness
and
bitterness
coffee
flavor
is
still
there
love
this
beer
and
lucky
enough
to
live
in
ma
treehouse
can
do
no
wrong
distant
second
to
good
morning
very
strong
on
the
coffee
to
the
point
of
being
a
bit
out
of
balance
definitely
a
step
or
two
down
from
good
morning
theres
not
much
more
to
say
treehouse
hit
this
one
out
of
the
park
again
if
i
had
some
now
i
would
put
it
in
my
morning
coffee
cup
smells
and
tastes
like
coffee
serving
type
on
tap
o
a
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
brew
which
does
not
suffer
from
a
thin
body
as
some
do
a
solid
top
level
stout
o
one
of
the
better
and
definitely
the
best
in
recent
memory
regular
coffee
stouts
ive
had
i
wish
this
was
available
locally
because
i
would
definitely
drink
this
regularly
thanks
again
for
the
growler
kevin
appeared
solid
black
in
the
light
of
the
bar
with
a
dark
brown
head
that
retained
as
a
small
ringlet
leaving
dots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
earthy
roasty
coffee
in
the
aroma
dark
malts
and
more
roast
good
melding
of
dark
malts
and
coffee
in
the
taste
which
i
like
as
opposed
to
some
coffee
beers
which
end
up
tasting
like
a
fullblown
glass
of
cold
coffee
notes
of
caramel
ash
and
maybe
some
subtle
dark
fruit
rich
tasty
smooth
medium
to
mediumfull
body
i
can
be
picky
with
coffee
beers
but
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
100
coffee
dominated
the
flavor
is
also
strong
with
coffee
but
there
is
plenty
of
beer
aspect
remaining
get
this
its
great
thank
you
heath
for
sharing
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
ive
had
even
up
against
some
double
digit
abv
stouts
overall
not
bad
but
mostly
just
all
coffee
doesnt
have
a
ton
going
for
it
other
than
the
coffee
which
is
great
but
more
complexity
or
at
least
the
nice
malts
i
know
are
there
that
cant
get
through
due
to
the
coffee
just
overpowering
them
would
be
nice
o
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
loads
of
coffee
but
thats
about
it
really
would
benefit
from
some
barrel
aging
some
day
edit
had
a
sample
at
the
source
and
it
cemented
how
delectable
this
beer
is
overall
an
ok
stout
i
was
expecting
much
more
from
avery
straightforward
pours
with
almost
no
head
very
very
dark
hoppy
with
very
little
malt
flavor
almost
closer
to
a
porter
or
black
ipa
than
a
stout
still
a
tasty
brew
oi
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
brew
i
dont
know
why
regardless
this
is
an
excellent
stout
worth
seeking
out
not
bad
but
in
world
with
many
better
not
again
for
me
the
taste
brings
out
a
coffee
grainy
character
with
an
earthy
bitter
bite
at
the
end
o
solid
beer
would
have
again
please
avery
adjust
your
mash
temperatures
o
i
usually
really
enjoy
the
offerings
from
avery
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
especially
not
the
flavor
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
stout
glass
black
in
color
with
a
quickly
dissolving
head
that
leaves
lacing
on
the
side
smells
like
roasted
black
coffee
and
subtle
roasted
barley
tastes
like
black
coffee
with
subtle
hints
of
bitter
chocolate
that
works
with
the
coffee
taste
it
has
a
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
it
is
thin
for
a
stout
but
not
so
thin
that
it
is
watery
with
a
barely
noticeable
hop
flavor
as
swallowing
this
is
something
that
is
probably
very
good
on
tap
but
just
good
bottled
o
decent
stout
the
hops
used
in
this
is
a
bit
different
than
typical
american
stouts
but
the
roastiness
and
hops
come
together
for
a
very
tasty
if
bitter
combination
overall
damn
this
is
another
great
stout
seriously
bold
flavors
of
roasted
malt
beautifully
balanced
with
some
sweetness
and
hops
absolutely
delicious
an
alright
stout
nothing
amazing
would
try
again
basic
stout
good
smell
but
overall
nothing
makes
it
outstanding
but
a
decent
stout
overall
worth
a
try
overall
this
stout
has
a
promising
aroma
but
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
a
bland
mess
maybe
10
months
of
shelf
life
has
killed
what
might
be
an
otherwise
great
stout
but
im
not
getting
much
of
what
might
have
been
candidate
for
a
rereview
but
to
be
blunt
my
expectations
with
a
fresher
bottle
isnt
very
high
chocolate
malt
flavor
coming
through
but
expecting
more
roasted
for
a
stout
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
is
almost
black
with
ruby
highlights
close
to
a
1finger
beige
head
is
seen
that
settles
down
to
a
3mm
of
so
after
a
bit
sheets
of
lacing
is
seen
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
with
a
good
amount
of
cocoa
pretty
much
the
same
is
said
for
the
taste
with
a
light
hint
of
coffee
unlike
some
stouts
that
have
a
lot
just
a
very
slight
bitter
finish
which
is
probably
from
the
semisweet
cocoa
very
tasty
and
goes
go
easy
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
for
this
brew
style
overall
i
liked
this
one
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
roasted
malts
and
tobacco
with
a
thick
char
and
ash
feel
i
think
this
an
underrated
beer
it
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
nice
onefinger
beige
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
it
smells
and
tastes
like
dark
chocolate
with
coffee
notes
with
a
decent
hop
presence
in
the
backgroundsort
of
like
a
junior
imperial
stout
this
is
a
solid
beer
o
a
very
solid
stout
that
ive
been
wanting
to
try
for
a
while
now
drinkable
flavorful
and
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
kick
im
on
board
a
decent
stout
but
this
is
the
junior
varsity
compared
to
mephistopheles
if
you
want
a
6pack
of
a
drinkable
stout
rather
than
going
for
the
gusto
then
this
is
a
good
choice
but
as
good
as
avery
is
with
their
bigger
beers
why
not
gear
up
for
that
instead
poured
midnight
black
into
the
old
snifter
1
finger
of
ecru
the
wifes
word
head
with
very
small
bubbles
shes
a
looker
this
had
some
nice
mild
coffee
and
chocolate
aromas
with
a
nice
faint
tobacco
note
as
well
the
tobacco
note
transferred
to
the
taste
and
the
slight
sweetness
nice
malty
notes
and
slight
bitterness
were
good
but
not
the
complete
package
mouthfeel
was
rather
light
for
the
style
but
nothing
worrisome
i
must
admit
this
is
a
good
stout
i
am
a
bit
partial
to
bigger
stouts
myself
and
this
may
have
clouded
my
judgment
just
a
little
bit
solid
but
maybe
more
of
a
tick
than
a
keeper
for
me
pitch
black
until
disturbed
at
which
point
it
goes
a
little
brown
light
tan
head
aroma
is
coffee
and
dark

taste
is
similar
with
more
pronounced
coffee
and
earthy
hops
nice
weight
excellent
regular
stout
nice
roasty
qualities
with
some
malt
complexity
and
a
subtle
hop
presence
pleasant
but
not
overwhelming
makes
for
a
drinkable
experience
o
a
more
than
solid
stout
definitely
recommended
if
you
like
stouts
overall
its
a
decent
enough
stout
this
beer
is
dark
brown
black
color
it
has
a
decent
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
filled
with
cocoa
toasted
malts
not
too
heavy
or
too
light
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
know
thhat
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
like
to
have
it
again
if
i
can
find
it
again
this
pours
a
dark

color
with
a
decent
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
filled
with
cocoa
coffee
and
toasted
malts
the
flavor
is
wellbalanced
and
smooth
its
a
stout
that
isnt
too
heavy
or
too
light
smooth
malts
and
cocoa
are
very
evident
this
finishes
a
with
a
bit
of
chalky
malt
after
taste
very
drinkable
overall
and
with
some
really
great
flavours
to
it
this
could
be
a
genuinely
superb
brew
if
it
were
a
bit
bigger
i
say
that
and
then
remember
that
perhaps
the
bigger
version
of
this
is
something
like
averys
mephistopheles
stout
and
yes
that
is
a
beer
throbbing
with
indescribable
power
i
guess
its
no
bad
thing
to
be
the
smaller
wimpier
brother
to
a
beer
like
that
o
a
notable
stout
definitely
recommendable
not
however
what
could
be
had
with
similar
brews
flavorful
stout
with
character
still
quite
light
and
drinkable
relatively
hoppy
but
far
from
aggressive
a
flavorful
beer
from
avery
a
bit
lighter
than
i
look
for
in
an
american
stout
interesting
flavor

for
some
reason
this
beer
just
doesnt

overall
i
was
disappointed

in
my
opinion
could
use
either
some
sweetness
or
richness
to

this
thing

i
really
like
avery
but
not
their

and
roasty
bitterness
the
chocolate
character
is
pleasant
theres
a
bit
of
harshness
thats
offputting
d
this
was
a
nice
stout
nothing
special
but
the
scent
was
solid
the
taste
and
body
could
have
been
better
and
the
finish
was
a
little
rough
so
it
wasnt
the
easiest
to
drink
but
still
not
a
bad
brew
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
well
executed
low
abv
stout
lots
of
flavor
for
a
lighter
stout
feel
is
not
particularly
substantial
but
the
relative
thinness
of
it
does
make
a
good
match
for
the
crisper
taste
overall
this
is
easily
drinkable
and
a
nice
attempt
at
doing
something
different
without
any
real
missteps
but
at
the
same
time
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
its
worth
trying
if
you
get
a
good
price
if
youre
more
of
an
ipa
person
this
would
probably
be
a
decent
gateway
to
the
heavier
dark
beers
overall
quite
nice
would
definitely
drink
again
overall
pretty
nice
american
stout
that
is
drinkable
and
enjoyable
o
nice
one
here
id
love
to
try
it
a
bit
fresher
so
the
hops
will
be
more
defined
right
now
however
its
solid
but
unexceptional
im
on
the
fence
about
buying
this
one
again
overall
this
is
tame
very
tasty
and
easily
moves
its
way
into
the
starter
stouts
not
a
bad
effort
yet
nothing
about
this
stout
really
jumps
out
and
grabs
me
pours
a
dark
brown
color
12
inch
head
of
a
dark
tan
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
slight
alcohol
hint
of
pine
and
a
hint
of
dark
citrus
fits
the
style
of
an
american
stout
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
noticeable
bitterness
tastes
of
strong
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
slight
hops
hint
of
pine
hint
of
dark
citrus
and
slight
alcohol
overall
good
appearance
body
aroma
is
simple
and
the
blend
is
dramatically
bent
towards
roasted
malt
flavors
and
bitterness

d
started
out
strong
but
ultimately
didnt
do
much
for
me
o
nice
beer
for
the
style
overall
a
good
stout
imo
and
one
ill
continue
to
purchase
o
a
surprise
that
it
tastes
so
much
like
a
porter
apparently
a
hoppedup
stout
perhaps
a
bit
thin
for
a
porter
and
definitely
for
a
stout
nevertheless
a
quality
brew
and
a
bargain
at
the
1
25
it
cost
me
id
definitely
buy
more
the
next
time
i
want
porter
i
was
going
to
hate
this
beer
but
the
more
i
drink
the
better
it
got
great
color
looks
good
in
a
glass
says
the
ypound
it
with
hops
but
its
not
a
factor
here
it
just
has
a
bitter
sweet
taste
and
it
a
stout
so
im
saying
try
it
you
may
like
it
a
rosaty
good
fun
beer
enjoy
the
beer
is
black
with
a
small
broken
head
the
aroma
offers
some
light
roast
and
chocolate
super
smooth
and
easy
drinking
man
youve
got
to
love
a
good
cask
ale
nothing
like
it
light
in
body
with
a
mild
chocolate
and
roast
character
working
together
nicely
also
a
bit
of
bready
malt
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
solid
oas
i
mentioned
above
there
is
a
quite
a
mixture
of
smells
and
flavors
here
sometimes
that
is
a
good
thing
but
here
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
layer
or
integrate
with
one
another
so
my
palate
is
left
confused
this
beer
does
get
credit
for
good
looks
and
for
coaxing
flavors
out
of
a
6
3
stout
that
i
would
normally
expect
to
find
only
in
an
8
or
9
percent
ris
but
the
flavors
here
just
didnt
hookup
overall
in
a
sea
of
great
stouts
this
one
is
forgettable
and
lacks
anything
which
really
warrents
me
to
come
back
o
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
stout
that
has
a
a
great
flavor
it
does
not
shy
away
from
boldness
and
will
not
leave
one
disappointed
only
wish
is
that
it
had
a
slightly
thicker
consistency
with
greater
head
overall
avery
has
some
really
decent
stuff
having
that
large
a
as
a
standard
on
their
labels
help
to
recognize
and
remember
when
youve
had
their
products
while
the
stout
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
it
easily
meets
the
other
stouts
in
its
taste
and
i
could
probably
have
another
one
of
these
o
a
solid
stout
offering
but
not
a
crowd
pleaser
nothing
stands
out
to
really
bring
me
back
to
this
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
wont
revisit
o
definitely
a
stronger
medium
body
beer
i
liked
it
but
there
was
nothing
there
that
makes
me
want
to
buy
more
i
like
avery
and
love
ellies
brown
ale
for
me
this
a
solid
but
not
spectacular
stout
a
fine
moderate
abv
nonbarrel
aged
nonsoured
everyday
stout
o
this
one
had
plenty
of
taste
for
the
abv
but
it
didnt
seem
to
gel
quite
right
and
the
tobaccolike
smell
was
a
bit
if
a
turn
off
o
good
beer
kind
of
unique
in
how
dry
and
roasty
it
is
while
still
maintaining
balance
a
perennial
favorite
for
me
o
a
decent
american
stout
with
hefty
roasted
character
and
a
good
spike
of
hoppiness
i
wish
they
let
the
malt
character
come
through
which
would
take
a
reduction
in
roasted
malt
decent
but
not
really
a
goto
beer
personal
rate

o

aboveaverage

the
nose
and

stood
out
to
me
the
most
i
like
this
beer
average
final
thoughts
i
liked
this
one
at
just
under
10
for
a
sixpack
its
a
fair
deal
its
robust
beyond
its
6
3
abv
expect
a
big
roasty
profile
and
some
decent
bitterness
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
especially
in
the
colder
months
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
there
are
plenty
of
stouts
out
there
and
this
one
doesnt
really
stand
out
from
the
rest
but
it
might
be
worth
a
try
solid
but
nothing
spectacular
overall
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
and
again
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
in
warm
weather
but
would
welcome
it
alongside
a
warm
chili
in
the
cool
of
the
fall
or
winter
this
is
a
solid
beer
its
simple
but
full
flavored
the
nose
caught
me
off
guard
but
the
big
roasty
flavor
made
up
for
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
if
i
come
across
it
again
ill
buy
a
few
more
bottles
o
not
super
spectacular
but
a
very
solid
classic
american
stout
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
this
brew
poured
with
a
barely
there
tan
head
that
hung
around
for
the
duration
of
the
drinking
but
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
body
was
a
deep
and
dark
brown
due
to
the
color
there
was
no
visible
carbonation
on
the
brew
the
nose
was
glorious
it
had
lots
of
coffee
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
which
is
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
stout
the
taste
was
very
much
of
the
same
that
was
apparent
in
the
nose
i
got
a
lot
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
not
as
much
chocolate
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
the
brew
had
very
low
carbonation
and
the
finish
lasted
awhile
with
the
roasted
malts
it
also
had
medium
thickness
this
was
definitely
a
great
brew
and
i
cant
believe
its
taken
me
so
long
to
try
it
i
will
definitely
have
this
one
again
a
solid
stout
both
for
a
summer
day
or
these
transitional
chilly
months
overall
this
beer
has
it
all
going
on
full
bodied
malty
with
a
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
flavor
light
body
for
super
drinkability
id
have
this
any
day
of
the
week
a
avery
overall
this
is
a
good
little
american
stout
i
wish
this
was
1
weaker
in
abv
for
the
amount
of
flavor
but
still
id
have
no
problem
knocking
back
a
few
pints
of
this
o
great
stout
im
really
digging
the
hop
character
and
bitterness
in
this
one
o
overall
this
is
a
great
stout
and
i
have
plans
on
drinking
more
of
these
in
the
future

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
it
has
a
very
nice
flavor
profile
as
well
as
a
very
nice
aroma
only
thing
holding
it
back
is
the
lack
of
an
lacing
which
really
can
be
pardoned
as
well
as
the
somewhat
too
thin
of
a
body
overall
though
it
is
quite
nice

stouts
i
have

still
worthwhile
smooth

but
only
average
fizz
overall
a
decent
stout
if
not
outstanding
give
it
a
try
o
far
from
the
worst
stout
ive
had
but
also
far
from
the
best
o
this
was
a
really
good
stout
actually
closer
to
a
porter
than
a
stout
really
whats
the
difference
the
roasty
aftertaste
was
my
favorite
part
not
bad
at
all
pours
an
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
beans
and
some
cocoa
powder
notes
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
some
coffee
and
cocoa
flavors
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slight
crispness
but
a
somewhat
light
body
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
but
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
in
my
opinion
dark
brownblack
color
with
big
head
that
is
retained
throughout
there
is
heavy
lacing
and
this
beer
is
beautiful
to
behold
aroma
is
big
roastedsmoky
malt
flavor
matches
with
initial
malty
sweetness
strong
smoke
flavor
and
a
dose
of
hops
to
finish
things
off
almost
two
fingers
of
dark
brown
foam
highly
dimpled
surface
looks
like
someone
just
whipped
it
with
an
egg
beater
decent
retention
given
the
large
amount
of
larger
bubbles
the
lacing
is
not
thick
but
stays
present
in
wide
sticky
sheets
on
the
glass
sides
the
liquid
is
close
to
black
but
you
come
down
deciding
its
really
just
very
dark
brown
touch
of
orange
at
the
glass
bottom
loads
of
roast
to
the
nose
still
its
the
green
herbaceous
hoppiness
which
is
most
evident
this
over
coffee
cocoa
and
malted
milk
ball
accents
pronounced
floral
side
too
the
burnt
qualities
make
it
difficult
to
discern
much
fruit
its
general
dryness
makes
an
impression
just
smelling
it
fullbodied
close
to
heavy
but
more
so
just
dense
for
the
sake
of
being
dense
nothing
gained
texturally
from
it
here
the
dryness
takes
some
sting
out
of
the
roastiness
palate
already
deadened
some
dark
roast
coffee
beans
cocoa
to
pine
dried
flowers
earth
and
tar
bring
big
pucker
factor
the
carbonation
does
not
distinguish
itself
however
doesnt
really
seem
undercarbonated
either
ok
a
pinch
of
cherry
to
red
plum
fruit
could
give
you
a
little
more
to
love
here
but
no
doubting
its
strong
personality
a
nicely
sessionable
stout
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
big
roast
and
almost
a
sweet
oatmeal
like
in
the
taste
dry
roast
with
notes
of
coffee
a
smooth
and
medium
to
bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
roast
and
note
of
pine
hops
in
the
aftertaste
a
good
flavor
and
nice
hop
presence
in
the
end
quite
nice
a
good
example
of
the
style
that
manages
to
get
dark
fruit
qualities
without
actually
adding
fruit
like
the
north
peak
porter
with
cherries
in
it
o
the
big
black
stout
is
dry
with
a
big
roasted
barley
gives
it
nice
flavor
but
is
a
bit
to
big
for
a
session
beer
but
still
tasty
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
for
a
widely
available
basic
stout
it
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
nothing
incredible
just
a
good
solid
brew
that
i
will
be
glad
to
order
again
this
is
a
nice
roastycoffee
tasting
stout
with
some
hop
bitterness
pleasing
and
easy
to
drink
if
youre
looking
for
a
lighter
stout
that
is
flavorful
and
not
too
heavy
this
would
be
a
really
good
choice
overall
completely
average
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
but
if
i
would
have
bought
a
sixer
i
would
be
upset
a
pass
for
me
pours
a
dark
brown
cola
color
with
a
one
finger
dark
khaki
colored
head
the
head
leaves
some
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
earthy
hops
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
big
roasted
malt
backbone
there
is
also
a
slight
earth
hop
bite
that
is
really
about
it
the
taste
is
not
overly
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
lowly
carbonated
and
a
bit
thin
overall
this
is
an
average
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin

the
taste

a
little
lacking

kinda
felt
closer
to

from

a
stout

medium
bodied
at
its
thickest
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
not
bad
but
not
really
my
thing
o
overall
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
better
than
i
expected
from
the
scent
its
a
good
stout
overall
a
nice
stout
nothing
surprising
or
unusual
just
a
tasty
beer
overall
rating
reflects
the
fact
that
i
oscillated
between
3
5
and
4
for
taste
not
a
bad
stout
feels
nice
and
the
taste
is
there
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
what
is
lacking
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
dry
finish
and
the
robust
malt
activity
throughout
the
other
flavors
however
were
a
bit
subdued
and
we
would
have
liked
to
see
a
thicker
feel
to
back
up
the
stronger
flavoring
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
it
isnt
ideal
as
the
flavoring
is
not
rounded
out
as
nicely
and
as
strongly
as
one
might
hope

dvery
easy
drinking
and
solid
stout
nice
and
complex
i
would
buy
this
one
again
for
sure
notes
i
started
drinking
this
one
while
it
was
still
a
little
too
cold
the
aroma
really
changes
as
it
warms
another
avery
revisiting
this
time
going
even
darker
it
pours
a
straight
onyx
topped
by
a
finger
of
deep
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
light
char
really
more
of
a
darklytoasted
bread
kinda
thing
dark
chocolate
powder
and
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
for
good
measure
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
same
pattern
though
everything
is
darker
roastier
toastier
more
charred
and
subsequently
bitterer
aside
a
reviewer
before
me
mentioned
something
about
chicory
in
retrospect
i
think
thats
indeed
something
that
came
through
just
surreptitiously
without
making
itself
known
very
well
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
solid
stout
but
its
a
bit
too
roasty
for
my
tastes
especially
in
something
like
this
which
to
me
is
meant
to
be
more
of
an
everyday
stout
if
that
makes
sense
yum
pours
a
dead
sexy
black
color
into
a
stout
glass
with
a
one
and
a
half
inch
tan
head
smells
like
dark
roasted
barley
and
faint
coffee
taste
is
really
roasted
and
a
little
smokey
chicory
root
and
licorice
notes

i
wouldnt
call
this

its
not

dry
at
all
and
the

is

elsewise
it

d
not
a

overall
actually
sessionable
but
not
a
great
one
by
any

i
dont
know
what
bounds
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
out
of
but
it
operates
well
within
the
bounds
of
any
reasonable
stout
ive
ever
had
despite
adjectives
on
the
label
such
as
big
and
extreme
and
despite
the
tons
of
roasted
malts
and
the
mountains
of

used
to
make
this

disappated

thickened
up
on

and
left
lacings
as
i
drank
the
beer
smelled
very
slightly
of
oatmeal
didnt
pick
up
much
for

slightly
grainy
with
very
small
touch
of

sugar
tasted
bitter
on
the

and
in

mouth
very
easy
to
drink

not
very
pleasant
due
to
the
bitternessacidity
this
beer
pours
an
attractive
inky
black
with
lots
of
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
on
the
surface
of
the
liquid
but
clings
aggressively
to
the
glass
aroma
is
very
lightly
sweet
and
roasted
like
coffee
with
condensed
milk
in
it
flavor
is
rather
roasty
but
occupies
an
unsatisfying
ground
that
is
neither
exceptionally
dry
and
roasty
no
burned
pizza
crust
nor
sweet
like
the
aroma
would
indicate
mouthfeel
is
not
bad
but
just
a
bit
watery
up

not
bad
but
not
great
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
more
candy
barish
than
is
typical
for
the
style
not
a
lot
to
set
it
apart
from
other
stouts
but
it
would
be
a
decent
session

satisfying

flavored

tempered
by

malts
mmm
mmm

quite

it
out

bounds
stout
poured
an
extremely
dark
brown
that
almost
had
me
fooled
that
it
was
a
dark
black
beer
it
tried
to
pull
a
fast
one
but
it
didnt
work
if
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
you
can
see
a
few
glimmers
of
ruby
red
highlights
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
it
had
a
1
and
a
half
inch
head
of
tanmocha
foam
that
had
decent
retention
that
left
behind
some
mocha
rings
along
the
edge
of
the
beer
and
some
spotty
tan
lace
around
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
roasted
coffee
beans
roasted
malts
cocoa
dark
chocolate
and
with
a
slight
funky
smell
of
black
smoke
in
the
background
the
taste
was
slightly
dry
with
bitter
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
cocoa
powder
roasted
coffee
beans
and
a
few
dry
roasted
hops
in
the
background
when
the
beer
really
warms
up
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
will
emerge
in
between
the
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
dry
aftertaste
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
avery
says
this
beer
is
an
extreme
experience
thats
stretching
it
a
bit
too
far
a
nice
offering
from
avery
that
has
plenty
of
roasted
flavors
but
its
no
where
near
extreme
going
down
the
widowmaker
now
thats
extreme
this
beer
not
even
close
would
i
pick
this
one
up
again
in
the
future
i
might
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
decent
reasonably
priced
dry
stout
overall
i
would
say
that
it
is
an
average
beer
with
above
average
potential
pours
a
deep
black
that
obscures
all
light
a
thin
tan
head
quickly
rises
no
waiting
for
this
stout
to
foam
but
disappears
way
to
quickly
smells
of
piney
hops
and
burnt
oak
with
something
sweet
and
malty
creeping
in
from
the
back
dry
hoppy
taste
and
burnt
caramel
mouthfeel
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
not
as
creamy
as
it
should
be
good
brew
but
lacks
a
little
something
to
make
it
a
great
this
came
of
as
more
of
an
english
stout
to
me
not
th
best
but
a
pretty
good
one
the
flavor
was
mostly
coffee
with
some
sweetness
from
the
yeast
it
was
a
big
rich
flavor
a
bit
heavy
but
still
nice
the
aroma
also
focused
on
the
coffeeroasted
grains
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
stouts
black
in
color
with
a
small
but
lasting
head
of
white
foam
moderately
aromatic
with
hints
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
burnt
currants
big
roasted
malt
flavor
with
notes
of
chocolate
coffee
and
plums
followed
by
a
substancial
citrus
twang
from
the
hops
very
hoppy
but
it
works
with
this
very
well
nice
mouthfeel
a
very
good
beer
the
taste
is
also
a
bit
odd
the
smoked
malt
thing
returning
roasted
a
whole
bunch
not
very
much
depth
to
it
the
body
is
somewhere
around
medium
the
carbonation
about
right
but
still
comes
off
a
bit
well
off
in
all
not
my
favorite
selection
from
avery
and
i
do
like
my
stouts
but
overall
pretty
decent
the
mouthfeel
of
this
is
very
rich
and
deep
incredibly
creamy
and
dry
ill
be
drinking
many
more
of
these
but
not
tonight
drinkability
is
alright
i
will
finish
the
beer
without
any
problem
but
one
is
enough
give
it
a
try
d
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
stout
for
nonstout
drinkers
it
is
not
too
heavy
on
the
palate
and
the
flavor
is
not
overpowering
this
one
puts
the
dry
in
irish
dry
stout
dark
as
can
be
on
the
pour
a
bright
light
coaxes
only
a
bit
of
crimson
at
the
margins
capped
by
a
rocky
clingy
tan
head
darkly
roasted
smells
dominate
the
nosecoffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
though
a
bit
of
ripe
dark
fruit
is
present
too
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
overtaken
by
heavily
roasted
malts
mediumbodied
at
the
start
giving
way
to
a
lingering
dry
finish
that
invokes
downing
a
spoonful
of
cocoa
powder
intense
but
not
very
nuanced
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
wont
likely
grab
it
again
maybe
a
little
bitter
but
still
very
drinkable
drinkability
ill
have
to
average
it
one
bottle
can
be
quite
drinakable
however
i
would
rarely
want
to
make
this
a
session
or
even
have
more
than
one
this
beer
pours
a
really
nice
opaque
black
with
a
huge
3
finger
dark
tan
head
that
laces
all
over
the
place
the
smell
is
black
coffee
and
a
lot
of
roast
malt
and
black
patent
with
a
touch
of
a
wood
smokey
character
as
well
maybe
a
bit
too
heavy
on
roasted
maltburnt
coffee
the
taste
is
full
of
bitterness
from
the
dark
malts
combined
with
a
burnt
or
iced
coffee
taste
not
something
im
a
big
fan
of
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
definitely
still
a
medium
bodied
beer
but
maybe
im
too
used
to
the
full
body
and
smoothness
of
guinness
a
decent
to
good
irish
dry
stout
not
a
standout
by
any
means
but
not
bad
for
a
change
of
pace
d
id
probably
try
this
again
though
i
wouldnt
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
a
good
not
great
beer
serviceable
balanced
stout
fine
for
a
dry
irish
style
stout
with
some
coffee
a
tad
heavy
roast
with
a
spot
of
smoke
jet
black
colour
appropriate
carbonation
medium
mouthfeel
and
dryish
finish
a
bit
bitter
and
acidic
in
aftertaste
like
coffee
can
be
worth
a
try
a
decent
overall
brew
but
i
expect
more
from
avery
which
usually
serves
up
a
more
robust
brew
still
it
is
an
irish
dry
so
they
did
hit
that
mark
an
ok
dry
stout
perhaps
a
bit
one
sided
with
the
char
and
some
offness
that
was
unsuiting
to
the
overall
experience
md
smooth
and
well
balanced
a
nice
stout
from
a
nice
brewery
well
flavored
and
well
balanced
an
easy
down
stout
that
is
easy
to
enjoy
a
very
flavorful
dry
irish
stout
which
is
quite
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
to
the
boring
onedimensional
offerings
that
are
out
there
in
abundance
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
this
style
a
six
pack
of
out
of
bounds
wont
disappoint
the
dryness
is
nice
really
bites
the
toungue
but
is
a
bit
thin
in
the
back
i
love
avery
but
this
falls
very
short
no
real
balance
no
real
character
and
finish
is
almost
awful
if
you
want
something
more
than
dry
overall
a
very
nice
dry
stout
very
sessionable
toasted
in
honor
to
those
who
are
in
the
middle
of

mouthfeel

level
pretty
drinkable
stout
that
would
make
a
nice
session
poured
into
a
sammie
smith
english
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
opaque
not
quite
totally
black
right
on
style
very
large
and
rocky
headvery
impressive
very
good
lacing
not
much
of
an
aroma
which
surprised
me
the
taste
is
really
roasty
and
very
nice
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
full
a
really
good
drinking
irish
style
dry
stout
avery
has
done
another
good
job
here
avery
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
fave
western
brewers
d
very
good
stout
the
roasted
malt
flavor
is
very
nice
pours
with
a
jet
black
body
and
khaki
colored
rocky
head
that
sticks
tenaciously
to
my
glass
roasted
malts
and
coffee
sweetened
with
brown
raw
sugar
on
the
nose
on
the
tongue
this
beer
steps
up
its
complexity
it
starts
out
thick
and
just
a
bit
bitter
with
hops
before
moving
on
to
silky
sweetsour
malts
typical
to
the
style
the
finish
is
long
and
bone
dry
with
roasted
malts
warming
the
tongue
this
beer
is
on
the
thick
and
substantial
side
especially
compared
to
the
paragons
of
the
style
but
it
doesnt
compromise
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
very
good
irish
dry
stout
staying
pretty
true
to
style
while
also
being
identifiably
american
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
little
off
the
flavors
arent
as
balanced
as
it
could
be
the
unusual
woodyness
and
immense
dark
grain
seem
a
little
harsh
i
didnt
have
any
trouble
drinking
this
one
but
there
is
better
out
there
very
drinkable
a
very
good
dry
irish
im
really
digging
the
extra
bitterness
in
it
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beers
body
is
sleightly
less
than
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
bigger
body
to
this
beer
the
beer
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
has
been
sessioned
at
my
place
on
numerous
occasions
thanks
for
the
trade
hogtownharry
this
one
couldnt
wait
to
get
out
of
the
bottle
and
celebrate
so
after
pouring
85
foam
between
an
ayinger
mug
and
a
sunset
tall
glass
and
refilling
with
the
excess
from
the
bottle
it
finally
came
to
a
mushroom
cloud
atop
the
sunset
glass
and
sllllllowly
settled
theres
still
a
smoke
puff
of
scud
cloud
at
top
and
thats
fine
with
me
daddyo
everything
has
its
purpose
and
as
such
this
cloud
performs
its
duty
similar
to
winter
cloud
cover
does
in
keeping
heat
from
escaping
and
the
tempertaure
from
plummeting
this
buffer
zone
keeps
me
from
gulping
this
fucker
right
down
exultant
dark
mark
mucilaginous
hops
and
an
indeterminable
scintilla
of
fruit
that
gives
a
puissant
taste
which
perorates
in
idiolallic
tongues
yes
it
is
ok
to
look
over
the
precipe
laugh
and
then
consider
jumping
bold
bitter
burnt
thats
how
i
would
characterize
this
beer
appearance
is
very
dark
brownblack
slight
tan
head
stays
consistent
throughout
fair
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
crisp
burnt
malty
first
sip
and
everyone
thereafter
is
bitter
hoppy
aftertaste
is
bitter
as
well
solid
stout
but
would
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
few
at
a
time
the
mouth
is
light
yet
dries
out
getting
bitter
and
smoky
on
the
finish
i
wish
there
was
some
more
complexity
more
of
a
progression
into
the
rather
harsh
finale
its
alright
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
avery
d
pretty
solid
stout
nothing
unexpected
but
nothing
out
of
whack
dry
pleasant
on
a
cold
day
and
hits
the
spot
i
can
see
myself
eaasily
enjoying
one
or
two
of
these
in
an
evening
very
easy
to
drink
sessionable
not
a
complex
beer
but
a
well
done
beer
very
solid
poured
a
rich
very
dark
brown
with
almost
no
head
and
a
few
tan
bubbles
looks
much
thinner
along
the
edges
when
i
tilt
the
glass
and
shows
some
reddish
highlights
not
all
that
aromatic
for
a
stout
but
smells
faintly
nutty
and
malty
very
smooth
and
creamy
at
first
sip
but
it
doesnt
take
long
for
the
hops
zing
to
kick
in
prickly
on
the
tongue
as
i
swallow
and
finishes
very
dry
with
a
bit
of
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
certainly
not
a
boring
beer
im
pretty
sure
im
a
fan
and
will
definitely
revisit
pours
a
jet
black
color
with
brownish
white
head
that
has
more
than
14
inches
worth
of
head
on
it
leaves
lacing
as
it
falls
but
has
no
real
lacing
itself
the
head
is
thick
a
fluffy
like
ice
cream
the
smell
is
like
an
expresso
with
good
roastiness
and
some
cocoa
as
well
taste
is
coffee
like
the
expresso
smell
mouthfeel
is
smooth
overall
i
think
its
ok
worth
drinking
more
often
tasty
enough
but
there
are
better
versions
of
the
style
probably
should
be
reclassified
as
a
milk
stout
drinkability
i
stopped
at
one
but
i
only
had
one
i
could
get
down
with
a
few
of
these
d
for
the
style
its
better
than
most
the
dry
crispness
makes
it
easy
to
drink
with
some
nuts
or
cheese
the
flavor
is
full
rich
malty
bitter
roasty
spicy
bitter
out
of
bounds
stout
had
a
medium
body
that
lacked
the
feeling
i
look
foward
to
in
a
good
stout
it
wasnt
a
bad
stout
it
just
seemed
to
be
another
beer
from
a
brewery
that
seems
to
make
soso
beer
to
me
its
a
nice
style
but
it
had
nothing
to
set
it
apart
from
anything
this
beer
was
poured
slow
out
of
a
tap
and
it
produced
a
rich
thick
head
that
lasted
nearly
as
long
as
i
had
the
beer
in
front
of
me
i
nearly
burned
my
nostrils
trying
to
smell
this
the
very
dark
roasted
malt
smelled
smoky
like
embers
with
coffee
and
charcoal
it
had
a
lovely
mouthfeel
very
creamy
if
you
like
malt
this
has
it
in
spades
but
the
flavor
was
a
litttle
too
overdone
for
me
like
sucking
on
a
burndt
down
forrest
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
this
one
although
it
was
somewhat
of
a
unique
take
on
a
stout
worth
buying
a
bottle
and
sharing
it
with
some
friends
just
so
you
can
say
been
there
done
that
i
know
ill
look
for
this
beer
on
my
next
beer
restock
excursion
pretty
easy
to
drink
several
hopefully
the
rest
of
the
new
avery
beers
will
fail
to
disappoint
as
well
unlike
many
of
the
higravity
beers
of
theirs
ive
had
drinkability
the
burnt
coffee
flavors
were
abit
of
a
turnoff
for
me
admittedly
a
noncoffee
drinker
i
could
imagine
it
being
more
drinkable
in
the
winter
but
for
me
id
much
prefer
a
number
of
stouts
over
this
one
its
not
bad
but
it
wasnt
great
could
drink
this
for
quite
a
while
definitely
sessionable
even
though
its
quite
a
monster
of
a
stout
there
are
plenty
of
beers
id
rather
drink
but
i
could
drink
this
one
for
as
long
as
i
was
out
12
ounce
bottle
avery
out
of
bounds
stout
pours
out
black
with
a
large
brown
head
the
aroma
is
an
earthy
roastines
roasted
coffee
flavor
with
some
nuttiness
not
much
hop
flavor
there
is
a
restrained
sweetness
but
the
finish
is
very
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
good
drinkability
if
this
beer
had
a
stronger
maltiness
it
would
be
a
perfect
dry
stout
as
is
its
still
pretty
good
nice
drinkability
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
which
is
right
on
for
the
style
but
mouthfeel
isnt
overly
thick
and
heavy
sits
light
on
the
stomach
something
i
could
come
back
to
often
since
the
abv
is
low
but
the
flavor
is
still
there
a
true
to
style
irish
dry
stout
and
beats
guiness
by
a
mile
pours
about
as
close
to
black
as
you
can
get
nice
tan
head
great
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
body
is
on
the
light
side
taste
is
almost
fruity
up
front
but
the
finish
was
a
bit
bitter
for
me
still
a
good
beerand
well
worth
a
try
a
little
too
dry
to
enjoy
more
than
a
few
but
stout
lovers
would
probably
easily
session
this
although
i
prefer
the
new
world
porter
avery
comes
through
again
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
and
generously
carbonated
a
solid
stout
to
be
sure
but
it
lacked
a
certain
wow
factor
to
push
it
over
the
top
the
body
is
black
what
color
is
it
around
the
edges
black
there
too
head
is
slightly
tangrey
not
at
all
deep
brown
and
thick
and
rocky
smells
very
strongly
of
black
tea
oh
man
now
that
i
thought
of
that
i
cant
smell
anything
else
slightly
bready
a
little
bit
of
a
soda
scent
taste
mouthfeel
taste
is
also
tealike
dry
and
bready
resolving
to
roasty
malt
a
slight
bitterness
persists
in
an
otherwise
clean
palate
body
is
kind
of
thin
and
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
that
thicker
would
be
ok
but
the
lightness
keeps
it
drinkable
notwithstanding
the
glacial
overpass
pictured
on
the
bottle
the
tea
flavor
makes
me
think
this
would
be
a
nice
summer
afternoon
beer
verdict
i
cant
say
its
the
best
irish
stout
around
but
its
a
nice
stab
at
it
mouthfeel
is
full
and
robust
good
stout
but
not
the
most
drinkable
strong
flavor
12oz
bottle
there
was
pretty
much
no
head
at
all
on
my
sample
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
the
main
component
of
the
nose
is
chocolate
malts
with
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
in
there
also
there
is
also
some
coffee
notes
the
taste
is
a
good
mix
of
chocolate
malts
with
some
roastiness
and
coffee
flavors
a
bit
of
the
sweetness
comes
through
also
nice
drinkability
is
average
for
the
style
bought
a
nice
big
bomber
while
on
vacation
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
a
slight
head
of
off
white
to
tan
a
little
hoppy
citrus
on
the
nose
and
some
roast
coffee
aroma
as
well
taste
is
nice
roasty
and
slightly
burnt
not
overwhelming
roast
sensation
though
actually
a
little
less
than
i
might
like
mouthfeel
is
fairly
crisp
and
dry
could
be
a
little
thicker
the
slightly
thinner
mouthfeel
definitely
makes
it
easy
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
guys
for
my
tastes
i
think
i
would
most
likely
max
out
at
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
is
a
no
nonsense
pay
attention
to
me
kind
of
beer
hanging
out
with
friends
everyone
sharing
in
the
craft
beer
revolution
this
would
be
a
hit
i
dont
think
i
could
handle
a
beer
like
this
at
the
average
bar
while
being
distracted
by
yuengling
drinking
friends
who
no
doubt
would
be
ordering
their
third
or
fourth
rounds
while
i
was
still
savoring
my
first
save
this
for
those
occasions
when
you
can
pay
this
stout
the
attention
it
deserves
it
will
be
worth
your
while
this
is
a
rather
easy
to
drink
stout
pours
a
nice
nearly
opaque
dark
color
the
head
was
moderate
in
size
and
duration
the
smell
was
nonstimulating
with
only
faint
hints
of
the
malts
within
the
taste
is
slightly
better
than
average
being
slightly
malty
with
limited
hints
a
fruity
flavors
the
mouthfeel
which
is
very
smooth
really
makes
this
a
highly
drinkable
brew
while
i
wouldnt
recommend
searching
this
beer
out
if
you
come
across
it
it
is
worth
giving
a
go
as
a
mild
and
highly
drinkable
stout
overall
wish
there
was
some
more
complexity
in
the
taste
pairs
very
nice
with
some
smoke
oysters
great
smell
like
a
bbq
just
lit
with
fresh
cedar
chips
nice
deep
black
color
but
hard
to
get
a
head
out
of
it
and
what
little
i
teased
up
faded
fast
mmmm
quaffable
and
bitter
without
being
annoyingly
overhopped
like
a
lot
of
averys
stuff
damn
solid
beer
that
id
love
to
see
on
draft
somewhere
uf
looks
like
a
porter
but
a
little
darker
with
a
good
white
hat
the
beer
thins
too
much
on
the
side
the
smell
is
nice
roasted
with
out
too
much
coffee
more
chocolate
tastes
good
if
a
little
thin
i
would
like
a
touch
more
body
i
know
it
is
only
5
and
all
but
i
guess
you
could
session
it
but
not
something
to
seek
out
cheers
avery
hasnt
impressed
me
so
far
as
i
have
tried
this
stout
and
their
ipa
but
here
goes
poured
dark
to
black
with
very
little
head
and
almost
no
lacing
smells
strong
with
coffee
most
of
all
and
hints
of
chocolate
hops
are
ever
present
as
well
tastes
of
strong
coffee
which
doesnt
appeal
to
me
as
much
as
some
stouts
as
well
as
its
very
bitter
and
watered
down
isnt
even
a
pleasent
feeling
drink
perhaps
due
to
the
watered
down
nature
something
that
i
wouldnt
drink
regularly
is
this
beer
worth
drinking
you
bet
it
is
i
would
probably
keep
a
few
of
there
in
my
beer
fridge
if
i
could
find
them
drinkability
not
hard
to
drink
but
not
good
pours
a
dark
blackish
color
with
slight
ruby
highlights
the
head
is
tan
thick
dense
and
longlasting
this
is
a
fine
looking
brew
the
aroma
has
a
pleasing
and
very
intense
roast

its
exactly
as
a

smell

through
and
doesnt
disappoint
a
bit
of
sweetness
is
upfront

its
mostly
dry
and

there
are

with

well
i

quickly
retort
malts
with
mild
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a

bite
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
irish

stouts
mouthfeel
is
certainly
thicker
than
the
guinness
and

ive
had
in
the
past
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise
certainly
superior
to
the
two
massproduced
imports
still
one
of

styles
of

i
wouldnt
be
seeking
this

this
is

representation
im
not

its
worth
going
out
of
your

to
try
this

really
quite

maybe
a

just
a

carbonated

these

really
know
how
to
make
a
great
beer
while
it
is
not
my
favorite
of
their
beers
it
beats
a
lot
of
other
breweries
stouts
out
of
the
water
it
has
a
great
coffee
chocolate
aroma

b
o
eh
im
not
super
stoked
by
this
its
a
decent
roasty
stout
dryer
than
most
flavors
are
a
bit
one
dimensional
t
color
me
impressed
i
know
alpine
is
know
for
the
hops
but
this
is
a
nice
beer
nice
harmonization
of
chocolates
roast
and
sweet
malt
my
criticism
would
be
maybe
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
almost
makes
it
feel
like
a
soda
otherwise
its
an
easy
drinker
with
nice
flavors
not
heavy
enough
to
be
a
sipper
but
not
something
to
rush
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
cadillac
mountain
in
some
ways
what
a
great
example
of
a
nice

to

a

oa
good

but
the
unbalanced

hurts
it
captain
stout
was
slightly
disappointing
it
looked
rich
and
beautiful
had
a
decent
head
but
lacked
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
what
i
typically
enjoy
in
oatmeal
stouts
not
super
robust
lacking
in
mealiness
went
down
more
like
a
porter
and
i
didnt
detect
much
in
the
way
of
chocolate
notes
not
bad
but
not
excellent
pours
an
opaque
very
dark
brown
with
a
quickly
dissipating
pale
mocha
head
chocolate
up
front
on
the
nose
that
yields
to
coffee
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
little
to
no
chocolate
in
the
flavor
but
smoke
and
coffee
in
spades
finishes
pretty
abruptly
c
o
overall
a
nice
stout
are
you
sure
this
isnt
a
porter
super
easy
drinker
o
a
really
easy
drinker
lots
of
stout
characteristics
but
nothing
beyond
pushing
it
to
outstanding
a
really
good
stout
but
it
isnt
anything
breathtaking
nice
to
try
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
this
was
a
pretty
solid
stout
in
my
opinion
not
as
above
average
as
alpine
ipas
are
to
the
rest
of
the
world
but
pretty
good
overall
its
a
solid
beer
nothing
exciting
but
nothing
disappointing
i
would
drink
it
if
i
found
it
on
tap
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
overall
alpine
is
not
known
for
their
dark
beers
and
this
beer
is
no
reason
for
that
change
it
certainly
isnt
bad
but
it
is
mediocre
which
i
suppose
means
its
pretty
bad
in
terms
of
comparing
o
if
youre
looking
for
an
everyday
dare
i
say
session
american
stout
youve
come
to
the
right
place
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
its
such
a
chill
beverage
yet
it
aint
easy
to
craft
something
this
well
balanced
and
drinkable
an
easy
recommendation
from
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
breweries
o
just
light
enough
to
be
able
to
want
to
drink
more
but
big
enough
to
carry
all
the
aspects
of
the
beer
well
balanced
and
a
lot
of
fun
to
drink
not
necessarily
exciting
but
a
well
performed
beer
types
of
beers
i
wish
were
made
more
often
down
here
and
not
the
watery
4
5
ones
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
stout
with
lots
of
balanced
flavors
but
still
on
the
lighter
side
and
fairly
sessionable
from
the
usual
22
oz
bottle
quite
drinkable
but
i
cant
see
paying
the
bomber
price
for
an
average
stout
medium
bodied
but
on
the
fuller
end
with
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
roasted
malt
notes
slight
creamy
texture
and
not
as
smokey
as
the
aroma
suggests
hints
of
toast
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
oatmeal
along
with
some
creamy
silky
chocolate
not
overly
roasted
acrid
or
but
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
one
was
not
too
bad
it
never
really
wowed
me
in
any
way
but
it
was
still
pretty
solid
a
good
pallet
cleanser
after
all
the
sours
we
had
overall
an
easy
drinking
stout
with
simple
tasty
flavors
appropriately
dry
not
necessarily
outstanding
for
the
style
but
certainly
good
one
doesnt
generally
think
of
stouts
when
they
think
of
alpine
do
they
a
rather
standard
beer
from
alpine
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
isnt
it
crazy
how
this
retails
for
8
in
stores
even
around
san
diego
yet
5
at
the
brewery
a
good
stout
but
not
awesome
almost
more
of
a
big
brown
but
still
tasty
o
this
was
a
nice
end
to
a
rough
day
but
in
all
honesty
really
expect
more
from
alpine
it
was
ok
but
not
as
in
your
face
as
the
rest
of
alpines
lineup
that
i
have
had
overall
this
is
an
ok
stout
based
on
the
nose
it
is
a
let
down
great
nose
weak
flavor
fuller
medium
body
well
carbonated
a
little
chewy
and
sticky
on
the
tongue
a
pretty
decent
stout
although
ive
come
to
expect
a
little
more
explosive
flavor
from
alpine
o
an
easy
drinking
stout
while
not
overly
complex
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
a
little
more
chocolatecaramelvanilla
would
have
been
nice
63100
o
nice
flavors
but
the
mouthfeel
was
way
too
light
for
my
liking
a
decent
offering
from
alpine
mouthfeeloverall
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
great
amount
of
carbonation
very
smooth
and
creamy
overall
a
good
stout
nice
roast
character
and
nicely
integrated
flavors
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
o
pretty
drinkable
and
flavors
are
in
balance
nice
stuff
cheers
o
a
really
solid
stout
with
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
interesting
flavor
profile
o
not
bad
especially
for
the
price
around
45
bucks
definitely
a
nice
starter
to
stouts
i
would
consider
this
a
great
gateway
beer
from
getting
people
off
the
guinness
and
murphy
kind
of
watered
down
stouts
a
bit
of
a
miss
from
alpine
for
me
overall
i
found
this
enjoyable
but
more
of
a
sessiontype
stout
with
the
thin
light
body
that
wont
fill
you
up
but
i
lacked
that
great
mouthfeel
one
expects
with
an
oatmeal
stout
got
this
courtesy
of
a
trade
with
hamilton23
aggressive
pour
of
a
22
oz
bottle
revealed
a
dark
brown
with
a
huge
3finger
coffeecolored
head
lacing
was
thin
but
lasting
nose
was
coffee
roasted
vanilla
some
dark
chocolate
and
grains
taste
was
coffee
cocoa
with
some
citrus
milk
and
a
notable
nutty
taste
finish
was
somewhat
bitter
and
dry
mouthfeel
was
kinda
thin
and
not
overly
carbonated
if
you
had
given
me
this
blindfolded
i
would
have
guessed
this
was
a
stout
by
looks
but
a
porter
by
taste
liked
it
but
with
so
many
great
offerings
from
this
brewery
i
wouldnt
kill
for
another
decent
but
not
thrilling
o
a
lot
of
good
flavors
and
complexity
running
around
in
this
considering
its
a
single
stout
i
think
if
you
fixed
up
the
body
this
would
be
very
exceptional
instyle
i
loved
the
coconut
note
and
might
just
find
myself
trying
their
captain
willy
mix
someday
would
actually
probably
be
pretty
tasty
a
smooth
intensely
flavored
stout
alpine
isnt
just
the
best
with
hops
these
guys
know
their
roast
as
well
a
roasty
and
somewhat
sweet
stout
incredibly
drinkable
overall
i
enjoy
captain
stout
greatly
kind
of
a
guinness
on
chocolate
steroids
with
substantial
vanilla
bean
and
maple
flavors
just
wish
that
mouthfeel
was
more
than
she
wrote
taste
is
ok
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
dark

almost
has

keeps
its

never

22oz
bottle
poured
into
my
stone
taster
glass
not
a
thick
pour
but
this
looks
like
a
stout
dark
brown
with
some
tan
head
smell
is
fairly
muted
with
some
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
perhaps
some
coffee
taste
is
a
bit
watery
and
muted
as
well
roasted
malts
are
the
main
feature
a
little
thin
with
decent
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
from
alpine
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
moderate
malt
flavor
up
front
no
hops
to
speak
of
moderate
bitterness
and
roast
at
the
back
not
a
dry
finish
overall
a
decent
average
american
stout
pretty
good
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
is
a
bit
roast
and
oddly
cherry
sweet
its
actually
a
bit
of
an
uhoh
nose
that
taste
ugh
the
taste
a
huge
mess
of
sweet
dark
fruit
gross
cherry
sweetness
a
some
what
dry
finishing
stout
the
whole
thing
was
a
mess
and
possibly
and
infected
mess
i
dont
toss
that
term
around
but
this
was
pretty
awful
in
that
cherry
beginning
vinegar
way
that
suggests
such
alpine
makes
some
amazing
beer
and
this
in
the
state
it
reached
me
in
the
bottle
is
not
in
that
stratosphere
major
let
down
mouthfeel
was
thin
starting
to
get
a
bit
watery
lets
just
say
that
everyone
in
the
room
drain
poured
after
01
sips
i
gave
it
a
few
but
after
that
it
was
down
the
drain
pours
black
and
is
cola
brown
at
the
edges
under
light
two
fingers
of
creamy
light
khaki
colored
head
and
leaves
foamy
sheeting
on
the
glass
nose
is
very
sweet
with
brown
sugar
molasses
dehydrated
tropical
fruits
mango
guava
and
a
faint
whisper
of
roasted
malts
taste
hits
with
roasted
and
almost
charred
malts
and
some
coffee
and
again
with
a
dark
sugary
sweetness
and
no
fruit
to
speak
of
never
really
found
any
chocolate
character
in
this
beer
drinkable
and
tasty
albeit
somewhat
sweet
and
really
had
a
hard
time
getting
around
it
o
a
decent
light
stout
but
a
little
too
watery
for
my
tastes
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
having
this
one
again
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
tiny
12
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
smells
of
slight
chocolate
and
coffee
but
i
think
this
one
is
infected
there
is
a
musty
gym
socks
smell
this
would
make
the
2nd
alpine
beer
so
far
that
has
been
infected
taste
is
of
funky
chocolatecoffee
that
has
been
fermented
in
used
gym
socks
horrible
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
average
overall
another
loser
of
a
beer
from
alpine
and
i
am
disappointed
once
again
i
appreciate
this
is
a
fairly
6
priced
bottle
of
a
sessionable
oatmeal
stout
but
i
just
dont
see
the
complexities
in
this
beer
that
other
reviews
do
coffee
vanilla
caramel
just
dont
taste
it
in
this
beer
its
a
good
beer
for
sure
not
your
standard
stout
so
i
can
see
how
some
wouldnt
like
it
a
lot
but
i
think
its
tasty
o
easily
drinkable
but
i
would
rather
go
for
something
with
a
bit
more
depth
d
its
an
average
stout
at
best
personally
i
wouldnt
buy
another
bottle
finish
is
all
medium
bitter
black
coffeeespresso
not
their
best
work
not
very
complex
compared
to
a
lot
of
stouts
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
a
spotty
lacing
it
smells
of
coffee
and
chocolate
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
taste
is
the
same
its
is
coffee
and
chocolate
up
front
but
neither
is
spectacular
i
would
call
this
a
safe
beer
it
isnt
great
but
it
isnt
terrible
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
while
exponential
is
on
tap
3
0
d
pretty
mediocre
across
the
board
worth
a
try
but
mainly
to
know
that
this
shouldnt
be
sought
after
its
pitch
black
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
the
head
dissipated
quickly
and
does
not
lace
at
all
smells
very
malty
and
chocolatey
perfectly
stoutly
thick
and
oaty
taste
is
chocolate
massive
malt
backbone
something
slightly
nutty
or
sweet
and
fruity
i
like
it
its
very
drinksble
and
yes
good
mouthfeeling
just
what
i
look
for
in
a
stout
d
drinkability
is
pretty
high
a
pleasant
stout
for
sure
but
not
a
mindblowing
one
really
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
i
am
glad
to
try
it
i
would
happily
drink
more
of
these
if
the
opportunity
arose
d
outstanding
drinkability
i
think
it
ran
5
a
bomber
which
is
on
the
cheaper
end
for
bombers
in
this
state
i
am
impressed
and
will
be
seeking
this
out
again
im
glad
i
stopped
in
at
alpine
during
my
trip
to
sd
very
nice
brew
lower
abv
and
an
over
all
tasty
brew
make
this
an
easy
drinker
alpine
really
makes
some
very
enjoyable
beers
d
nice
but
really
big
flavors
would
tire
during
session
dthis
beer
had
a
nice
drinkability
factor
and
was
quite
pleasant
overall
drinkability
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
smelled
great
but
missed
the
mark
at
the
taste
it
lacked
the
complexity
that
i
look
forward
to
in
the
style
notes
i
would
have
guessed
this
was
a
porter
if
id
tasted
it
blind
i
think
the
name
threw
me
off
alpine
makes
big
beer
and
captain
stout
doesnt
sound
like
a
shrinking
violet
that
being
said
the
end
product
is
a
very
tasty
easytodrink
ale
and
one
i
would
recommend
to
someone
new
to
the
style
d
low
abv
and
good
flavors
make
it
a
very
drinkable
stout
imo
my
pour
created
two
fingers
worth
of
rich
deeptan
head
with
great
retention
the
nose
was
very
roasty
rich
with
coffee
and
chocolate
zounds
but
i
found
myself
wishing
that
i
had
someone
to
share
this
with
it
just
smelled
like
an
after
dinnerdessert
beer
and
a
bomber
would
probably
be
overkill
for
a
solo
drinker
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
definite
roastycharcoal
flavor
on
the
tongue
color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
going
back
to
the
taste
i
was
reminded
of
a
hersheys
milk
chocolate
bar
that
i
purchased
in
c
1970
for
10
my
first
allowance
my
mother
was
with
me
and
it
remains
one
of
my
earliest
memories
seldom
does
a
beer
evoke
such
vivid
reminiscences
but
this
one
certainly
did
the
finish
had
a
silky
quality
generally
found
in
caskconditioned
beers
accompanied
by
the
chocolate
flavor
that
simply
transported
me
in
time
i
feel
justified
in
giving
this
a
solid
5
while
i
appreciated
the
richness
of
the
flavors
here
the
thickness
of
the
roasty
character
and
overall
feel
just
help
the
drinkibility
back
some
for
me
despite
this
being
on
cask
im
interested
in
checking
this
out
in
the
bottle
or
draft
to
see
how
it
compares
dthis
is
actually
what
i
look
for
in
stoutsa
bit
of
coffee
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
sessionability
i
think
i
could
knock
down
a
few
of
these
around
the
fire
and
be
satisfied
good
stuff
deasy
drinking
and
big
bold
flavors
i
love
a
good
american
stout
with
nice
low
abv
and
this
is
done
quite
well
nice
roasted
backbone
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
overall
i
probably
wont
try
this
again
especially
if
there
are
other
things
to
try
or
i
know
are
better
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice
twofingered
head
the
smell
was
nice
lots
of
roasted
malt
and
a
little
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
is
quite
nice
as
well
with
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
as
well
as
coffee
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
roast

little
thin
but
very
drinkable

always

otherwise
a

this
beer
may
not
take
the
world
by
storm
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
very
acceptable
stout
might
not
be
my
first
choice
for
stout
but
id
not
turn
this
one
down
served
from
a
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
d
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
a
good
stout
to
have
thats
better
than
your
run
of
the
mill
guiness
but
not
a
big
ol
monster
of
a
beer
either
d
good
drinking
stout
you
can
have
a
few
pints
and
not
be
stuff
not
the
best
from
alpine
but
that
isnt
saying
much
as
they
have
a
barrage
of
incredible
beers
drinkability
is
high
i
had
to
down
8oz
within
about
a
minute
when
our
cab
showed
up
early
and
it
was
no
problem
although
it
didnt
help
my
brutal
hangover
the
next
day
solid
stout
from
alpine
overall
a
really
good
stout
that
for
me
falls
a
mostly
into
american
stout
but
with
strong
hints
of
milk
stout
and
a
little
bit
of
oatmeal
stout
had
this
at
the
brewery
during
my
trip
and
it
was
just
a
little
better
ontap
i
still
prefer
the
pure
hoppiness
and
duet
from
them
but
this
is
great
change
of
pace
and
a
quality
stout
rotation

overall
drinkability

this
is
a
wonderful
stout
full
of
character
that
i
could
enjoy
all
day
i
found
the
flavors
in
this
one
to
be
very
subtle
and
mild
not
really
in
a
bad
way
just
a
more
toned

than
im
used
to
a
slight
chocolaty

quality
didnt

quickly
mellows

id
probably
get

usually
flavor

this

pretty

what
it
reminds
me
of
is
a
souped

big

version
of
stockyard
oatmeal
stout
solid
drinkability
and
offers
a
smooth

recommend
d
a
real
nice
stout
from
the
guys
at

just
wish
i
could
get
it
up
here
would
be
a

quite
enjoyable

not
as
heavy
an
you
would
expect
not
light
but
creamy
overall
a
very
good

that
needs
a
bit
of
time
in
a
barrel
or
a
little
more
substance
notes
from

dark
black
healthy
head
smells
malty
and
tastes
like
it
has
a
touch
of
cocoa
not
a
bad
stout
and
a
nice
change
from
all
these
high
gravity
stouts
everyone
seem
to
make
these
days
solid
beer
and
im
glad
my
cousin
brought
it
to
me
and
i
wish
i
had
a
bottle
of
the
old
chez
monieux
to
follow
it
up
pours
black
with
a

is

old

minor
roasted

strikes
me
as
a
bit
green
a
bit
too
bright
and
tangy
decent
roasted
tones
feel
has
a
fairly
full
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is

aroma
with
moderate
roastiness
bitter
chocolate
flavor
with
a
metallic
roasty
finish
a
little
thin
but
still
very
drinkable
im
glad
that
i
got
to
try
this
and
id
recommend
it
to
others
but
its
not
necessarily
my
most
favorite
stout
out
there
overall
this
was
a
mixed
bag
for
me
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
much
fuller
then
it
was
the
aroma
look
and
flavors
were
really
quite
nice
but
that
bitter
and
acidy
taste
in
the
finish
combined
with
a
less
then
full
mouthfeel
were
real
distracters
for
me
still
though
a
very
worthy
stout
and
something
that
is
definitely
worth
trying
out
notes
a
very
solid
stout
but
i
can
think
of
a
few
others
i
like
more
purchased
south
bay
drugs
pharmacy
imperial
beach
ca
overall
a
decent
stout
but
not
fantastic
not
my
favorite
alpine
brew
but
still
good
good
to
see
they
took
a
break
from
brewing
all
those
ipas
will
probably
grab
some
bottles
of
this
in
the
future
recommended
pours
beautiful
as
a
stout
should
with
a
fuzzy
active
milk
chocolate
colored
three
finger
head
it
quickly
settles
to
just
a
half
inch
body
sets
in
the
glass
like
a
big
black
opal
nose
is
zesty
and
sweet
with
malty
spice
smoke
an
initial
sweet
and
sour
battle
dances
on
the
tongue
noticeable
bitter
sweet
feel
reminds
me
of
bakers
chocolate
this
tart
bitter
feel
bounces
off
each
other
and
completely
dominates
the
palate
as
for
as
an
american
stout
goes
this
one
lacks
the
soft
rich
balance
i
expect
from
this
style
mouthfeel
stays
with
that
same
sour
bitter
with
a
bit
of
thickness
as
i
do
some
research
i
relize
that
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
based
on
other
reviews
i
have
looked
at
as
far
as
this
one
goes
its
drinkability
is
just
ok
a
full
brown
with
lots
of
head
dots
of
lace
a
lactic
sourness
that
tears
through
before
settling
on
the
roasty
and
coffee
and
chocolate
malted
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamed
but
the
body
is
still
average
at
most
its
a
brown
beer
with
stouty
characteristics
pours
black
with
a
light
tan
head
smell
is
milky
roasted
malt
and
metal
at
first
body
is
a
bit
too
thin
but
not
too
bad
decent
roasty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
watery
finish
and
i
had
a
hard
time
deciding
how
much
i
liked
this
one
didnt
get
the
oatmeal
creaminess
as
listed
in
the
description
decent
but
very
forgettable
its
a
good
beer
but
its
definitely
not
the
most
impressive
stout
ive
ever
had

decently
good
beer
alpine

one
of
the
more
unique
beers
that
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
it
wouldnt
be
a
regular
purchase
assuming
i
had
easy
access

from
a

week

at

pours
with
a
clear
black
that
is
ruby
red
at
the
corners
nice
light
tan
head
builds
up
but
fades
fairly
fast
this
from
a
few
inches
away
this
beer
smells
of
high
roastiness
but
when
you
get
your
nose
into
it
a
ton
of
caramel
and
a
little
chocolate
come
out
the
taste
is
like
a
sweet
caramel
liquid
its
a
pretty
savory
beer
with
some
roasted
bitterness
at

very

stout
here
another
stellar
offering
from
alpine
this
might
not
quite
be
on
the
level
of
cadillac
mtn
but
its
not
far
behind
pours
a
complete
black
with
not
a
single
bit
of
light
coming
through
with
a
dark
tan
one
finger
head
with
large
bubbles
that
quickly
dies
down
to
just
about
nothing
stickiness
is
hardly
there
disappointing
in
a
sense
but
looks
can
be
deceiving
smell
is
a
great
combination
of
roasted
barley
dark
chocolate
malt
and
french
roast
coffee
sweet
caramel
malt
is
definitely
there
too
love
this
one
on
the
nose
tatste
starts
off
with
a
fresh
roasted
coffee
flavor
soon
followed
by
a
quick
hop
bite
midway
through
is
a
perfect
caramel
sweetness
this
one
ends
with
a
big
roasted
barley
flavor
that
lasts
and
lasts
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
bodied
with
some
graininess
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
great
drinkability
for
this
one
due
to
the
light
body
and
complete
absence
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
great
brew
overall
definitely
get
a
hold
of
this
one
if
you
have
the
chance
alpine
continues
to
produce
great
brews

an
opaque
black

coffee
beans
and
minimal
malt
and
caramel
finishes
with
a
bite
of
hops
medium
in
the
mouth
with
some
nice
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
its
not
a
sipper
but
its
not
a
session
beer
overall
a
tasty
offering
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
while
being
fairly
smooth
this
has
turn
into
a
staple
stout
to
be
in
my
beer
fridge
and
for
only
3
99
per
22oz
bottle
is
incredible
great
job
for
alpine
highly
recommended
one
of
the
best
american
stouts
i
have
had
and
loaded
with
chocolate
an
excellent
thing
and
yes
alpine
is
indeed
bottling
this
now
d
fits
style
well
flavor
is
excellent
would
pair
well
with
desserts
or
could
be
one
on
its
own
sessionable
recommended
the
is
surprising
this
tasted
like
it
had
alot
more
alcohol
than
5
5
this
is
an
interesting
stout
but
i
think
it
might
be
better
with
some
age
d
good
balance
with
nice
complexity
hand
crafted
and
well
done
another
fine
beer
from
alpine
the
flavor
is
all
of
the
above
super
rich
smooth
and
creamy
very
tasty
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
full
body
with
a
smoothness
that
is
easy
to
swallow
and
a
mild
abv
that
makes
it
all
too
easy
to
drink
a
great
breakfast
or
dessert
beer
highly
recommended

a

great
offering

one
of
the
better
dry
stouts
out
there
definitely
worth
a
try
or
even
a
session
not
to
be
missed
on
cask
this
beer
would
make
an
excelent
session
beer
it
is
not
high
in
alcohol
and
the
flavor
is
not
aggressive
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
ever
had
if
alpine
bottled
this
i
would
definately
keep
a
stock
of
it

head
showed
amazing
staying
power
and
the
aroma
was
strongly
of
coffee
and
chocolate

following
along
those
lines
the
taste
was
as
well
of
the
roasted

mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
excellent
for
such
a
heavy

i
could
try
it
over
and
over

dark

lush
with
a
creamy
lingering
into
the
middle
where
espresso
flavors
really
meld
in
incredibly
nicely
oh
so
close
to
burnt
roasted
espressolike
flavors
and
the
bittering
is
subdued
enough
for
full
enjoyment
quite
nice
to
behold
hence
the
finish
where
it
gets
a
bit
of
everything
mixing
and
changing
with
a
sweetened
roast
filled
espresso
dryness
that
has
a
chocolate
twinge

close

good
amount

an
espresso

chocolatey

coming
through
from
midway
all
the
way
to
its
remarkable
little
finish
nice
lingering
capabilities
with
the
bittering

espresso
this
reminds
me
alot
of
the
bells
java
stout
just
not
as
over
the
top
as
the
bells
but
right
up
there
just
the
same
big
thanks
to
the
big
dog
for
sending
me
a
refilled
and
capped
bottle
from
a
growler
im
assuming
overall
one
of
the
best
dry
irish
stouts
i
have
had
in
a
very
long
time
the
first
of
my
abc
samplers
and
still
my
favorite
after
the
other
three
a
larger
glass
would
have
been
ordered
for
sure
if
i
had
not
been
on
a
quest
to
try
as
many
of
the
offerings
as
possible
in
the
limited
time
we
had
as
well
as
the
fact
that
it
was
very
early
in
a
long
days
tour
of
san
diego
beer
establishments
highly
recommended
for
filling
growlers
or
any
container
for
that
matter
including
your
stomach
coffee
smell
and
taste
cold
as
it
warms
up
the
chocolate
comes
through
and
taste
sweeter
had
nitro
on
draft
and
traditionally
carbed
from
a
can

prefer
the
canned
better
not
too
strong
great
coffee
stout
taste
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
had
on
tap
at
a
winter
beer
fest
awesomely
clean
and
fresh
taste
for
a
stout
goes
along
well
with
their
other
offerings
like
blazing
world
love
modern
times
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
think
i
would
gave
been
more
impressed
if
it
was
called
a
porter
instead
of
stout
stout
conjures
thoughts
of
deep
abyss
blackness
and
insane
viscosity
this
beer
has
a
nice
taste
but
its
not
world
class
at
best
this
is
worth
trying
and
then
passing
on
minimal
carb
despite
vigorous
pour
smell
is
muted
with
some
black
coffee
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
seems
like
a
black
ale
taste
is
old
bitter
coffee
that
tastes
stale
there
is
no
canned
date
not
sure
if
the
beer
is
old
but
thats
on
the
brewer
to
date
if
this
beer
does
go
bad
or
fade
the
thinness
of
the
body
really
makes
it
hard
to
call
this
a
stout
pretty
good
stout
had
it
on
draft
and
i
think
i
could
taste
some
of
the
grounds
but
really
good
overall
coffee
flavor
pours
nearly
black
and
thinner
than
color
would
suggest
with
a
bit
of
beige
head
big
toasty
malty
rye
and
coffee
nose
taste
reminds
me
of
pumpernickel
bread
and
coffee
very
clean
finish
and
solid
stout
the
can
says
chocolatecovered
espresso
bean
and
that
is
a
good
description
a
nice
surprise
in
a
can
worth
a
try
would
love
to
try
the
variants
of
this
beer
my
favorite
stout
incredible
creamy
mouth
feel
but
not
viscous
fresh
roasted
coffee
nose
hits
you
right
away
flavor
has
mocha
smooth
coffee
not
bitter
i
can
drink
this
stout
all
day
even
on
a
warm
day
poured
from
a
20oz
big
boy
can
chilled
to
below
40
pours
a
deep
dark
chocolate
brown
if
not
black
12
finger
of
head
dissipated
quickly
aromas
of
espresso
thinking
ethiopian
and
sumatra
roasted
malts
light
in
the
mouth
with
strong
above
coffee
and
roasted
malts
not
boozy
must
be
light
abv
definitely
better
than
guinness
but
not
far
from
it
solid
like
it
stout
you
can
drink
all
day
on
a
warm
day
even
o
perfection
in
a
can
this
beer
is
exactly
what
the
label
says
it
is
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
if
i
could
verdict
a
nice
american
stout
from
modern
times
really
well
done
while
not
being
yet
another
10
coffee
stout
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
easy
to
enjoy
on
a
chilly
evening
nothing
too
pretentious
or
overly
complicated
just
simple
coffee
and
stout
goodness
not
a
huge
fan
of
low
gravity
nonbarrel
aged
stouts
but
this
bad
boy
is
packed
with
complexity
and
allaround
solid
flavor
coffee
is
perfectly
placed
and
the
roastyness
of
the
malt
shines
through
great
beer
from
modern
times
overall
a
good
beer
for
sure
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
didnt
get
much
coffee
for
it
worth
checking
out
and
solid
for
sure
would
buy
it
occasionally
if
i
were
a
local
easy
to
drink
roasty
chocolately
and
coffe
whats
not
to
like
huge
coffee
flavors
and
still
low
in
abv
i
like
what
they
did
here
i
could
throw
back
a
number
of
these
no
problem
overall
pretty
nice
a
big
creamy
rich
stout
with
nice
cocoa
milk
chocolate
roast
coffee
and
hint
of
bitter
hops
very
nice
rich
and
big
while
still
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
another
great
beer
by
modern
times
i
love
that
they
house
roast
their
own
coffee
this
beer
is
perfectly
balanced
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
i
really
enjoy
it
it
is
a
great
stout
at
a
great
price
the
verdict
darn
good
beer
they
describe
it
as
chocolate
covered
espresso
beans
and
that
just
about
covers
it
tmo
taste
really
matches
the
nose
a
medley
of
gourmet
coffee
the
can
says
75
ethiopian
and
25
sumatraman
would
i
love
to
try
the
coffee
of
the
blend
of
these
beans
nice
soft
vanilla
notes
round
out
the
chocolate
the
feel
is
way
more
porter
than
stout
fizzy
charcoal
and
although
the
low
point
of
the
brew
still
an
easy
drinker
very
impressive
beer
mi
would
like
the
beer
tube
beefed
up
and
stuck
in
bourbon
barrels
but
this
one
is
heaven
for
a
coffee
lover
while
i
greatly
prefer
bigger
bolder
ris
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
beer
pours
jet
black
with
a
halffingerwidth
head
the
aroma
is
pleasant
with
robust
coffee
and
a
touch
of
roasted
barely
the
taste
has
loads
of
coffee
but
its
not
overbearing
there
is
some
roasted
barely
on
the
back
end
interestingly
this
is
first
time
ive
had
a
beer
in
which
the
mouth
feel
was
a
majorcontributor
to
the
overall
rating
it
had
a
nice
medium
milky
mouth
feel
that
complemented
the
flavors
perfectly
the
beer
is
not
incredibly
complex
but
delicious
all
the
same
its
just
a
fantastic
beer
o
its
pretty
enjoyable
as
ive
found
with
a
few
of
the
coffee
beers
ive
had
lately
i
wish
the
coffee
would
be
just
a
bit
more
pronounced
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
its
really
smooth
and
has
a
real
nice
toasted
chocolate
flavor
that
is
definitely
enjoyable
on
its
own
for
sure
worth
a
pick
up
poured
from
a
pint
can
into
my
stone
snifter
pours
jet
black
with
a
delayed
light
tan
head
that
begins
to
form
from
the
middle
of
the
glass
smells
of
coffee
and
cigar
tobacco
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
smooth
and
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
pint
can
was
the
perfect
amount
for
a
good
relaxing
buzz
i
drank
this
beer
over
two
highly
regarded
imperial
stouts
because
i
didnt
want
an
entire
bomber
at
the
time
delicious
late
night
or
cold
weather
brew
will
be
buying
some
more
awesome
coffee
stout
if
you
like
coffee
and
beer
youll
love
this
i
wouldve
liked
for
a
little
more
head
on
the
stout
but
cant
complain
cause
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
is
great
highly
recommend
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
milk
chocolate
medium
roast
coffee
thats
pretty
fruity
dried
cherries
a
little
bit
of
cream
and
some
sugar
mildly
roasty
on
the
midpalate
the
chocolate
does
dominate
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
softly
carbonated
and
has
a
beautiful
coffee
flavor
on
the
finish
excellent
stuff
thanks
lincolnbeard
for
the
opportunity
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
dark
brownblack
with
a
thick
tan
head
a
lot
of
coffee
in
the
nose
some
chocolate
and
maybe
just
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
taste
follows
pretty
closely
a
good
amount
of
coffee
bitterness
i
dont
drink
many
single
stouts
mostly
imperials
so
obviously
the
lighter
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
different
for
me
although
expected
from
a
6
beer
overall
a
great
drinkable
stout
i
love
how
much
the
coffee
stands
out
in
this
one
its
so
smooth
too
it
feels
like
im
drinking
a
milk
stout
o
overall
a
nice
big
coffee
stout
however
thats
about
it
not
much
else
going
on
here
overall
this
is
an
okay
stout
needs
more
richness
and
other
flavors
overall
a
pretty
solid
brew
from
modern
times
would
gladly
pick
up
if
it
became
available
in
nj
overall
dominated
by
coffee
but
its
very
drinkable
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
not
too
much
for
me
to
love
it
the
way
this
brew
feels
should
be
heavy
and
coat
the
palate
with
its
goodness
there
could
be
some
more
residual
sweetness
from
the
malts
as
well
just
my
two
cents
worth
yet
for
being
a
stout
this
doesnt
scream
greatness
this
brew
is
worth
a
shot
this
stout
is
very
standard
the
appearance
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
all
mediocre
maybe
my
taste
buds
are
spoiled
or
maybe
they
arent
and
i
can
discern
a
quality
stout
over
something
simple
this
stout
is
pretty
cut
and
dry
simple
nothing
stands
out
or
makes
me
want
to
drink
this
beer
again
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
in
a
can
and
can
be
toted
around
fairly
easy
i
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
brew
but
i
also
have
nothing
good
to
say
either
i
would
try
this
again
overall
i
pay
to
have
access
to
some
type
of
stout
like
this
locally
the
version
of
east
ends
coffee
beer
they
recently
brewed
was
amazing
on
cask
at
pipers
pub
its
called
joe
melt
instead
of
their
winter
seasonal
snow
melt
all
comparisons
aside
this
stands
out
as
a
great
coffee
beer
that
this
newer
brewery
should
stand
behind
and
let
it
cruise
into
position
as
their
flagship
offering
that
will
put
them
on
the
map
for
the
rest
of
the
country
i
bet
those
16
ounce
cans
will
ship
great
across
the
country
once
modern
times
grows
enough
to
expand
overall
solid
allaround
stout
that
puts
coffee
on
full
display
i
have
never
had
a
more
intensely
coffee
flavored
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
i
expected
i
would
its
a
tasty
stout
that
delivers
on
its
promise
of
rich
coffee
flavor
it
is
lighter
than
other
stouts
that
i
prefer
but
i
would
hardly
say
that
detracts
from
its
appeal
not
the
most
exotic
beer
but
i
can
imagine
i
would
not
get
sick
of
drinking
this
very
quickly
would
recommend
overall
i
enjoyed
this
stout
very
much
it
tasted
exactly
like
it
smelled
which
was
a
little
too
overwhelmingly
coffee
but
not
unpleasantly
so
i
would
prefer
a
little
chocolate
notes
to
it
as
well
but
overall
very
enjoyable
i
tend
to
prefer
my
coffee
stouts
thicker
heartier
and
slightly
sweeter
but
this
is
a
quite
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
brew
solid
enjoyable
work
but
other
than
being
packaged
in
a
tallboy
can
which
is
indeed
awesome
it
doesnt
quite
pull
ahead
of
the
rather
crowded
pack
of
coffee
oatmeal
stouts
o
this
stout
really
delivers
on
the
roasty
and
coffee
aromas
i
would
have
liked
more
chocolate
maltyness
and
a
heavier
feel
but
this
is
good
for
a
coffee
fix
overall
wonderfully
balanced
and
i
love
its
simplicity
more
than
anything
this
would
be
a
great
go
to
stout
to
have
all
the
time
sort
of
reminds
me
of
cadillac
mountain
a
bit
minus
the
coffee
angle
16oz
can
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
cola
brown
with
fizzy
head
that
disappears
rapidly
the
nose
is
heavy
roasted
coffee
with
a
touch
of
oatmeal
and
biscuit
not
a
whole
lot
else
the
taste
is
similar
pretty
one
dimensional
heavy
coffee
roast
a
bit
of
cream
and
not
much
else
wish
there
was
more
of
a
malt
backbone
here
the
oatmeal
is
definitely
present
and
brings
a
cream
like
component
to
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
this
is
an
easy
drinking
coffee
stout
this
would
be
a
good
summer
stout
as
it
features
some
nice
roasty
flavors
but
drinks
very
light
and
is
refreshing
d
this
is
a
brew
served
two
ways
could
easily
pass
as
an
iced
mocha
in
the
can
even
though
the
coffee
steals
the
show
what
you
get
is
an
incredible
fusion
of
all
the
flavors
and
the
mouth
feel
is
a
true
delight
probably
my
favorite
from
modern
times
next
to
the
fortunate
islands
i
really
liked
this
beer
would
love
to
have
it
again
i
seem
to
detect
an
english
influence
throughout
though
the
lack
of
yeast
character
and
the
purity
of
the
coffee
bring
the
beer
back
to
this
side
of
the
pond
while
not
perfectly
to
style
it
is
a
tasty
brew
bonus
points
for
their
copywriting
packaging
and
label
design
wellmade
but
ultimately
somewhat
unsuccessful
take
on
a
coffee
stout
a
bigger
stouter
stout
would
have
supported
the
coffee
flavor
better
i
think
or
maybe
less
coffee
the
relatively
modest
nature
of
this
beer
note
the
abv
means
the
coffee
runs
roughshod
over
the
other
flavors
maybe
coffee
oatmeal
stouts
shouldnt
be
sessionable
a
solid
coffee
stout
a
heavier
bodied
mouthfeel
would
propel
this
effort
to
greatness
overall
not
a
bad
beer
however
i
prefer
a
bit
more
chewier
and
developed
stout
if
you
are
looking
for
a
straightforward
coffee
offering
of
this
style
this
is
for
you
light
black
in
coloryet
still
penetrable
to
light
a
minuscule
bit
of
khaki
colored
head
covers
the
top
brussels
lacing
aroma
of
dark
roasted
coffee
greets
my
nose
the
mouth
is
silkysmoothand
dry
the
taste
is
bitterly
dark
roasted
coffee
and
roasted
barley
the
finish
is
pretty
smooth
and
sweet
along
the
lines
of
plums
o
a
very
sessionable
stout
aroma
is
subtle
but
has
a
good
amount
of
coffee
light
bitter
chocolate
and
dark
malts
flavor
is
very
similar
with
a
balanced
coffee
component
playing
off
the
dark
malts
carbonation
is
right
on
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
thick
and
syrupy
overall
a
great
stout
that
i
will
have
whenever
i
get
the
chance
overall
really
good
beer
modern
times
is
making
some
excellent
beers
very
well
balanced
between
the
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
not
over
done
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
drinkable
stout
that
wont
knock
you
out
after
having
one
o
the
more
it
warms
up
the
better

coffee

earth
finishes
with
some
more
coffee
and
bitter
dark

mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
but
its
a
coffee
stout
so
it
fits
the
style
very
drinkable
with
very
little
alcohol
presence
roasty
with
lots
of
coffee
and
dark

with

with
sweet
coffee
and
a
hint
of

bitterness
nice
medium

a
nicely
made
and
balanced
coffee
stout
with
no
real
wow
components
but
nicely
put
together
and
quite
flavorful
for
a
nonimperial
stout
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
with
my
lunch
i
hope
to
taste
more
from
this
brewery
when
i
visit
southern
california
smooth
full
bodied
and
viscus
im
very
glad
that
i
bought
a
4pack
because
the
black
house
kicks
ass
its
very
flavorful
without
forcing
you
to
take
small
sips
the
type
of
beer
that
you
would
show
off
to
your
friends
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
toasted
oat
cocoa
and
slight
coffee
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
coffee
bean
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
slightly
better
cocoa
and
coffee
presence
in
the
smell
in
my
opinion
edit
i
have
had
the
nitro
version
on
tap
on
a
recent
visit
to
san
diego
and
i
have
to
say
that
it
really
really
does
well
with
nitro
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
this
on
nitro
o
a
nice
coffee
stout
im
a
fan
of
sumatra
coffee
and
could
distinguish
it
in
the
beer
highly
drinkable
for
a
coffee
stout
good
intro
to
modern
times
for
me
a
very
simple
and
good
coffee
stout
doesnt
cut
any
corners
with
the
flavor
or
the
aroma
mouthfeel
could
be
hefted
up
to
add
body
and
sweetness
to
the
back
end
of
the
drink
as
a
whole
im
feeling
it
but
like
your
little
sister
who
is
trying
to
be
the
next
jennifer
lawrence
there
is
still
more
work
to
be
done
low
abv
more
flavorful
taste
true
even
for
a
stout
still
getting
used
to
a
canned
stout
oh
well
here
it
is
nice
frothy
foam
in
the
glass
nice
pour
indeed
nice
head
super
dark
brown
distinct
can
taste
if
there
is
one
but
it
seems
so
nice
aroma
great
taste
chocolates
and
coffees
typical
of
the
stouts
and
very
nice
smooth
taste
wonder
if
the
can
plays
a
role
in
the
taste
kind
of
hard
to
envision
drinking
something
so
thick
and
yet
so
low
in
abv
but
hey
its
got
a
great
flavor
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
the
faintest
of
ruby
highlights
at
the
edges
when
held
to
light
the
aroma
is
fresh
ground
coffee
beans
in
spades
with
a
roasty
malty
edge
light
cream
and
earthy
hop
round
out
the
aroma
roasty
earthy
coffee
grounds
with
a
huge
bitter
edge
and
a
touch
of
cream
make
up
the
flavor
pretty
straight
forward
possibly
a
bit
one
sided
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
bitter
roasty
ashy
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
the
first
few
sips
of
this
but
as
my
glass
warmed
it
got
harder
and
harder
to
finish
the
pint
the
coffee
and
bitter
roast
is
over
the
top
on
this
especially
at
warmer
temps
there
needs
to
be
more
malty
sweetness
to
back
up
the
coffee
bite
here
imho
nice
dark
roast
coffee
ground
feel
and
some
good
black
malts
to
support
it
rich
aroma
is
especially
nice
overall
im
excited
to
get
some
cans
in
the
fridge
next
two
weeks
they
tell
me
maybe
in
my
opinion
this
immediately
jumps
toward
the
top
of
local
sub6
stouts
love
the
ability
to
kick
back
a
few
of
these
instead
of
the
crazy
10
abv
gutbombs
going
around
sometimes
less
is
more
coffee
flavor
is
quite
pronounced
but
its
a
nice
mellow
roast
a
tangy
taste
with
a
flicker
of
hops
but
mostly
its
the
dark
roasted
malt
some
charred
grain
adds
a
little
bitterness
this
has
a
better
coffee
flavor
than
a
lot
of
the
muddy
flavored
stouts
but
maybe
it
needs
some
cream
dark
dark
rubyish
color
kinda
looks
like
a
really
dark
coke
color
pours
a
dense
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
roasted
malts
tastes
chocolatey
and
coffee
like
has
somewhat
of
a
medium
creamy
mouth
feel
it
kinda
feels
a
bit
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
regardless
it
is
one
tasty
beer
not
sure
if
this
should
be
considered
a
stout
thick
head
not
super
dark
in
color
very
thin
i
rated
it
as
such
smelled
alike
a
stout
but
was
light
to
the
point
were
it
almost
was
a
porter
or
a
black
lager
tasted
fine
but
just
not
much
to
it
kinda
glad
its
just
a
single
not
a
drain
pour
by
any
means
just
kinda
a
boring
low
abv
stout
i
am
not
saying
low
abv
stouts
are
bad
there
are
just
much
better
stouts
in
this
abv
range
pitch
black
thin
brown
foamy
head
retention
and
lacing
small
slight
roasted
with
chocolate
aroma
watered
down
aroma
and
taste
malty
taste
with
more
chocolate
slight
bitterness
decent
and
drinkable
pleasant
enough
drinkable
beer
not
especially
dark
thin
body
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
other
than
dark
roasted
malt
nice
flavor
but
nothing
really
special
also
seems
a
bit
overcarbonated
to
me
pours
a
dark
brown
with
tan
head
roasted
malt
is
foremost
on
the
nose
with
a
little
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
coffee
follows
onto
the
palate
finishes
with
more
roasted
flavors
could
be
a
bit
stronger
for
a
stout
its
a
nice
stout
but
a
tad
on
the
light
side
for
my
taste
the
head
is
weak
at
best
and
dissipates
rapidly
it
has
a
hint
of
coffee
and
chocolate
that
is
not
over
whelming
it
pours
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
slight
amber
hew
it
has
a
lighter
then
average
feel
for
a
stout
with
a
smooth
light
roast
malty
finish
it
may
be
much
improved
with
a
nitro
poor
on
tap
however
i
have
only
partaken
in
the
bottled
version
maybe
ive
had
too
many
ba
imperial
stouts
lately
the
new
mobile
format
is
making
me
justify
my
rating
with
a
review
this
was
a
surprising
disappointment
coming
from
st
arnold
thin
mouthfeel
bitter
throughout
ive
tried
three
of
these
and
didnt
finish
any
of
them
got
home
and
realized
one
of
the
beers
in
only
half
filled
didnt
get
much
better
from
there
beer
looks
good
but
is
waaaay
too
light
tasting
for
my
liking
im
probably
going
to
switch
to
sierra
nevadas
narwhal
after
im
finished
with
this
beer
overall
not
a
bad
stout
a
little
light
bodied
in
my
opinion
but
well
worth
trying
this
stout
has
good
malts
and
chocolate
characters
to
it
and
the
hops
are
hidden
but
balanced
o
it
was
pretty
good
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
but
i
was
happy
to
try
it
o
major
disappointment
theres
just
a
pinch
more
dark
malt
in
this
than
sas
amber
lager
and
thats
a
bummer
a
perfect
gateway
beer
for
your
friends
but
if
you
want
a
stout
this
aint
it
o
the
2012
batch
seems
to
have
been
a
lot
better
from
what
i
remember
not
sure
because
i
have
come
a
long
way
since
then
and
never
even
reviewed
it
i
just
remember
drinking
the
2012
really
liking
it
and
wanting
more
it
is
not
bad
its
just
not
as
good
as
last
year
i
dont
think
i
bought
a
sixer
and
i
will
drink
it
but
will
not
be
buying
more
this
year
overall
this
was
lackluster
for
me
what
roasted
chocolate
flavors
that
are
present
are
quite
muted
that
chalky
presence
doesnt
add
wellness
to
this
brew
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
one
o
while
its
quite
lacking
in
the
mouthfeel
department
its
a
halfway
decent
beer
otherwise
above
average
stout
esp
from
cask
served
with
about
1cm
head
heavy
roasted
aroma
is
very
pleasant
initial
taste
is
softened
by
the
cask
but
still
has
plenty
of
flavor
certainly
less
acidic
finish
is
surprisingly
strong
with
a
good
deal
of
malt
flavor
remaining
along
with
the
thickness
of
the
stout
considerable
lacing
down
the
glass
sure
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
but
if
you
find
this
especially
from
a
cask
give
it
a
try
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
some
ruby
light
is
visible
along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
there
are
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malts
chocolate
nuts
and
toffee
the
tasty
follows
the
nose
and
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
the
roastiness
is
pretty
mild
overall
with
some
mild
toffee
sweetness
the
chocolate
and
nut
notes
also
play
well
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
producing
a
wellbalanced
brew
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
the
body
is
full
this
is
an
easy
drinking
stout
this
is
a
very
good
beer
this
is
an
angsty
teen
of
a
beer
a
lot
of
things
going
on
that
ultimately
dont
make
a
ton
of
sense
not
bad
but
there
are
better
takes
on
the
style
for
at
least
the
same
price
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
dark
hue
maybe
a
little
too
much
carbonation
not
much
of
a
head
and
no
real
lacing
nuts
and
coffee
with
black
licorice
in
the
nose
full
roasted
nutty
coffee
malt
body
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
o
saint
arnold
makes
some
serious
beers
in
my
opinion
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
it
has
all
the
classic
stout
characteristics
and
the
perfect
mouth
feel
puts
a
lot
of
other
stouts
to
shame
with
its
perfection
of
a
simple
approach
id
love
to
see
the
imperial
version
but
itll
probably
be
a
while
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
though
it
is
not
iconic
of
a
traditional
stout
for
drinking
in
cold
wet
environs
it
gets
the
job
done
here
in
southeast
texas
update
much
better
flavor
and
aroma
when
served
at
the
proper
temperature
im
an
idiot
or
impatient
numbers
upgraded
accordingly
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
moderate
carbonation
level
pours
out
lookin
like
a
soda
pop
dark
brown
body
with
ruby
highlights
has
the
head
of
a
soda
also
quickly
rises
and
quickly
fizzes
out
to
nothin
smell
is
pretty
weak
some
dark
malt
and
milk
chocolate
taste
is
meh
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
cola
like
if
i
didnt
pour
this
myself
i
would
swear
this
is
a
glass
of
pepsi
sittin
here
pretty
thin
and
weak
overall
in
all
categories
poured
a
deep
brown
with
a
nice
amount
of
tan
head
great
lacing
smells
of
vanilla
coffee
cocoa
caramel
very
sweet
in
taste
basically
tastes
like
cafe
con
leche
with
a
few
sugars
hints
of
toffee
subtleness
of
toasted
grains
a
very
nice
light
tasting
medium
bodied
stout
with
a
creaminess
to
it
that
makes
you
thirstier
and
thirstier
overall
a
really
good
light
tasting
stout
honestly
perfect
for
the
fallwinter
months
thanks
to
tim
in
houston
for
the
beer
trade
that
brought
me
a
six
of
this
brew
o
very
easy
drinking
stout
almost
a
hybrid
between
an
irish
stout
and
an
american
oatmeal
stout
imo
i
would
drink
again
if
it
was
around
but
definitely
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
good
value
good
product
just
need
a
little
more
oomph
in
my
craft
beer
quests
overall
a
medium
bodied
stout
but
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
but
its
slightly
1
dimensional
still
quite
drinkable
a
good
session
or
introductory
stout
im
always
glad
to
have
a
decent
goto
texas
beer
at
my
disposal
the
flavors
are
all
there
though
not
too
complex
its
not
heavy
enough
for
me
but
its
very
drinkable
so
if
you
want
a
good
and
drinkable
stout
then
this
is
a
good
choice
d
very
very
drinkalbe
enjoy
o
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
its
hard
to
go
back
to
normal
stouts
after
drinking
ris
for
months
but
this
one
is
very
good
m
o
thinner
mouthfeel
and
mediumlow
carbonation
to
this
one
pretty
sure
this
was
last
years
vintage
so
i
would
go
easy
on
it
winter
stout
is
not
bad
at
all
but
i
would
very
much
like
to
try
this
fresher
o
id
call
this
a
porter
but
everything
else
agrees
with
me
nice
sweetness
but
reserved
enough
to
remain
approachable
and
quaffable
the
taste
is
mildly
roasted
it
has
some
creamy
and
milk
chocolaty
notes
the
beer
has
a
light
maltiness
which
gives
a
bready
impression
the
bitterness
is
low
for
a
stout
the
hops
make
me
think
of
us
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
o
interesting
but
not
really
much
of
a
stout
overall
pleasing
flavors
mild
and
easy
but
has
good
malt
and
spice
to
it
very
flat
even
for
a
stout
would
be
good
for
an
intro
into
the
stout
world
o
its
a
bit
sweet
and
not
balanced
enough
to
really
enjoy
many
of
didnt
particularly
enjoy
this
one
hard
to
finish
the
bottle
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
little
pencil
thin
head
not
too
thick
of
a
pour
either
tastes
very
bland
some
malt
some
light
chocolate
and
a
little
roast
coffee
this
beer
was
over
carbonated
and
had
an
unwelcomed
acidic
finish
maybe
a
bad
bottle
but
this
beer
is
a
miss
for
us
taste
is
really
good
lots
of
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
taste
very
sweet
the
after
taste
is
bitter
and
more
sweetness
which
becomes
a
slight
turn
off
moutfeel
is
relatively
heavier
and
carbonation
is
excellent
this
is
a
very
solid
stout
that
doesnt
leave
me
feeling
bloated
mouthfeel
way
too
light
bodied
especially
for
the
style
nothing
making
me
enjoy
it
in
my
mouth
which
is
sad
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
o
i
feel
this
beer
has
been
unjustly
maligned
3
6
i
just
dont
see
it
easydrinking
tasty
and
solid
perhaps
not
the
best
stout
on
offer
but
certainly
more
than
mediocre
recommended
o
ehh
its
a
fairly
typical
stout
with
a
toothin
body
and
too
much
carbonation
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
overall
i
thought
this
one
was
a
pretty
average
american
stout
heavy
on
coffee
and
roasted
malts
it
was
a
bit
too
carbonation
for
me
as
well
glad
to
have
tried
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
overallvery
average
what
i
was
expecting
still
a
drinkable
beer
i
could
throw
one
of
these
down
at
7am
just
not
complex
and
rather
boring
notes
again
nothing
to
rave
about
but
it
made
for
a
nice
casual
stout
during
this
visit
to
texas
with
its
5
6
percent
abv
this
is
very
drinkable
its
not
flashy
wont
leave
a
major
impact
on
you
but
it
has
the
makings
of
a
goto
beer
big
thanks
goes
out
to
optimator13
for
sending
me
this
one
in
the
small
aquatic
mammal
bif
11
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
a
massively
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
two
finger
light
khaki
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cream
toffee
and
subtle
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocoalte
coffee
subtle
caramel
and
cream
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
american
stout
this
had
a
pretty
nice
flavor
that
made
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
as
with
most
american
stouts
i
have
had
this
one
also
wasnt
very
robust
the
aroma
was
okay
but
not
very
robust
either
definitely
worth
trying
as
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
while
sitting
out
on
the
patio
o
well
done
not
great
but
above
average
if
i
were
in
houston
and
this
was
on
tap
i
would
likely
drink
again
mouthfeeloverall
this
beer
is
slightly
over
light
bodied
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
not
bad
overall
this
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
doesnt
measure
up
real
well
probably
about
average
for
the
style
do
not
a
bad
little
stout
nothing
too
memorable
but
glad
i
was
able
to
have
it
very
easy
drinking
stout
rjt
d
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
no
profound
flavors
but
good
for
the
style
is
this
beer
getting
better
every
year
seems
like
it
a
little
more
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
but
by
no
means
a
lot
looks
great
with
its
black
translucent
pour
nice
head
lots
of
bubbles
a
little
lacing
and
small
head
taste
is
a
tad
more
complex
in
the
malt
department
than
i
remember
and
the
bitterness
is
a
little
more
pronounced
nice
job
sa
definitely
worth
getting
a
single
every
once
and
a
while
this
winter
lighter
medium
body
for
the
style
higher
carbonation
a
bit
dry
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
easy
on
the
alcohol
but
pretty
light
on
flavor
and
feel
as
well
drinkability
is
ok
the
beer
itself
is
pretty
good
decent
flavors
and
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
it
just
misses
the
mark
for
being
a
stout
d
one
of
my
favorite
local
stouts
when
it
comes
out
every
year
and
one
i
buy
when
i
can
this
is
a
nice
replacement
for
higher
abv
stouts
like
buried
hatchet
and
is
not
as
expensive
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
based
on
aroma
alone
i
expected
this
to
be
better
than
it
was
the
taste
just
doesnt
follow
up
and
the
mouthfeel
comes
off
a
bit
watery
this
one
is
just
okay
but
not
one
of
my
first
picks
for
a
decent
stout
i
thought
it
was
very
tasty
its
not
too
heavy
and
its
not
really
a
typical
stout
i
thought
it
tasted
like
a
cross
between
a
porter
and
a
marzen
thanks
freeverse
for
the
opportunity
picked
up
on
a
recent
trip
to
texas
my
first
saint
arnold
brew
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
black
but
the
body
allows
some
light
to
pass
which
creates
ruby
reddish
flashes
in
the
glass
small
tan
head
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
lightly
roasted
chocolate
but
both
are
somewhat
muted
pleasant
but
would
prefer
a
stronger
presence
similar
in
the
taste
all
the
elements
are
there
buy
would
love
them
to
stand
out
a
little
more
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
too
thin
almost
watery
finishes
dry
the
thin
characteristics
of
this
beer
arent
always
what
i
want
when
i
grab
a
stout
but
it
does
increase
the
drinkability
in
terms
of
being
able
to
drink
a
few
and
still
enjoy
it
i
dont
really
dig
any
of
the
saint
arnold
beers
except
the
divine
reserve
ones
and
lawnmower
aint
bad
im
beginning
to
think
theyre
all
too
light
for
my
heavy
beer
tastes
but
being
in
texas
and
almost
always
hot
they
probably
need
much
lighter
beers
not
quite
up
my
alley
mostly
but
im
sure
theyre
much
better
on
a
hot
day
in
texas
from
the
label
as
bishop
of
metz
saint
arnold
spent
his
life
warning
of
the
dangers
of
drinking
water
and
extolling
the
virtues
of
ale
during
his
funeral
his
pallbearers
stopped
to
slake
their
thirst
but
regretfully
there
was
just
one
mug
of
ale
to
share
among
them
then
a
miracle
came
to
pass
that
one
mug
never
ran
dry
and
all
of
the
thirsty
mourners
in
the
entire
gathering
were
satisfied
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
snifter
glass
thanks
to
philhyde
for
the
extra
beautiful
stout
beer
pour
black
with
dissipating
beige
head
nice
stout
aroma
rich
dark
chocolate
nuts
and
some
mild
roast
fun
and
nice
immediate
palate
bubbly
fresh
and
stouty
roasty
taste
does
not
overwhelm
very
good
stout
experience
there
is
a
developing
attempt
to
be
bitter
towards
the
end
just
what
i
expect
from
st
arnold
quality
beer
md
light
for
a
winter
stout
which
would
make
you
think
the
alcohol
and
flavors
would
be
big
could
pass
as
a
decent
english
brown
ale
but
a
stout
disappointing
d
the
thin
body
adds
quite
a
bit
to
drinkability
and
the
flavors
arent
too
upfront
a
solid
beer
if
a
little
lacking
in
the
typical
big
stout
flavors
solid
drink
it
was
a
nice
extra
from
a
good
trader
i
like
st
arnolds
9
and
i
think
st
arnolds
does
a
nice
brew
here
too
d
if
it
werent
for
the
odd
aftertaste
this
would
really
be
pretty
drinkable
as
it
is
however
its
almost
a
drain
pour
ill
finish
it
but
its
not
something
that
ill
look
for
again
for
a
dark
stout
i
was
very
surprised
how
watery
and
non
thick
this
beer
was
again
i
may
just
be
a
curmudgeon
with
bad
memory
and
changing
tastes
and
sensibilities
but
hey
isnt
that
the
definition
of
a
beer
geek
overall
this
is
a
solid
little
stout
with
solid
drinkability
definitely
my
favorite
from
st
arnold
we
should
be
seeing
in
stores
here
soon
and
im
pretty
stoked
now
saint
arnold
usually
hits
it
out
of
the
park
with
their
cask
offerings
not
to
mention
i
am
a
fan
of
the
winter
stout
to
begin
with
though
this
is
just
off
and
seems
week
to
me
along
with
the
odd
sourness
i
want
to
question
the
cask
or
stags
head
quality
though
both
those
are
usually
fine
a
disappointment
for
me
d
not
my
new
favorite
but
very
drinkable
good
session
stout
d
overall
this
was
pretty
light
and
enjoyable
yet
complex
enough
to
keep
my
attention
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
yes
but
this
one
strived
to
be
better
than
just
average
and
succeeded
a
good
drinkable
beer
all
around
d
well
this
one
is
getting
3s
across
the
board
for
the
fact
its
super
easy
to
drink
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
but
it
is
boring
as
all
holy
hell
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
formed
a
34
orangey
tan
head
above
the
slightly
cloudy
orangey
amber
brew
head
falls
gradually
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
spicy
sweetness
taste
begins
with
spicy
maltiness
finds
somewhat
tart
fruitiness
in
the
middle
and
closes
lightly
chalky
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
soft
over
the
tongue
with
alright
drinkability
was
looking
for
more
on
tap
at
alamo
west
oaks
the
beer
was
fairly
opaque
and
dark
brown
good
12
fingers
of
tan
foam
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
more
on
the
roasted
side
than
sweet
toasted
and
a
little
biscuitbread
but
mostly
roasted
malts
same
with
the
taste
not
as
sweet
as
id
like
but
still
not
bad
fairly
simple
roasted
malt
stout
profile
medium
body
i
guess
this
is
a
simple
fairway
shot
safe
and
playable
but
not
anything
to
make
the
crowds
applaud
with
appreciation
while
this
beer
wasnt
really
the
american
stout
i
was
expecting
its
a
quality
very
easydrinking
winter
seasonal
d
its
a
drinkable
stout
not
too
heavy
overall
probably
no
surprise
here
but
this
is
a
good
porter
how
it
ever
got
labeled
a
stout
is
beyond
me
i
dont
think
anyone
that
knows
much
about
porters
and
stouts
would
call
this
a
stout
in
a
blind
taste
test
another
question
what
makes
this
a
winter
stout
when
i
here
a
name
like
that
i
think
there
might
be
a
bit
of
spices
or
something
that
sets
it
apart
from
a
regular
stout
porter
but
nadda
d
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
like
a
nice
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
and
there
is
more
sweetness
to
this
beer
than
most
stouts
the
hop
flavor
gives
it
a
really
nice
balance
and
the
light
body
makes
it
highly
drinkable
different
than
the
dry
irish
stouts
and
popular
imperials
tasty
and
worth
a
try
while
this
received
lower
marks
in
some
categories
i
felt
it
tasted
just
fine
i
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
but
would
gladly
drink
it
if
offered
i
want
to
like
this
there
just
isnt
enough
there
to
like
i
would
probably
drink
this
again
but
not
over
any
of
their
other
beers
i
enjoy
some
of
the
year
rounds
more
at
least
it

this
is
a
thinbodied
stout
it
goes
down
easy
but
it
is
very
light
for
the
style
there
is
no
lingering
taste
or
mouthfeel
you
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
it
feels
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
alcohol
is
very
slight
d
very
good
for
a
stout
the
lighter
flavor
and
body
make
for
easy
drinking
i
liked
this
one
nothing
incredible
or
really
special
but
a
good
serviceable
easydrinking
stout
thin
watery
stout
alcohol
not
hidden
well
which
is
kind
of
funny
considering
its
only
5
abv
head
dissipated
quickly
one
of
the
lighter
colored
stout
ive
seen
almost
no
lace
thin
nose
offering
roasted
barley
malt
and
espresso
coffee
the
taste
is
thin
and
hurt
by
a
poor
mouthfeel
offering
burnt
coffee
beans
dark
chocolate
covered
coffee
beans
and
the
hops
add
an
earthy
character
this
might
be
good
to
a
newb
but
not
to
an
experienced
stout
drinker
honestly
i
have
been
very
unimpressed
with
saint
arnolds
even
their
divine
reserve
series
has
only
been
beefed
up
versions
of
their
already
crappy
beers
poured
into
a
new
belgium
glass
dark
brown
at
first
then
to
black
once
it
filled
the
glass
thin
off
white
head
min
lacing
there
is
a
slight
carmal
malt
scent
to
it
the
taste
is
fairly
generic
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
hop
front
is
slight
but
the
carmel
sweets
are
well
defined
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
isnt
too
terribly
thick
probably
just
perfect
overall
this
is
a
very
very
drinkable
winter
treat
allaround
average
its
a
stout
very
solid
beer
thanks
guys
d
nothing
exciting
but
its
enjoyable
and
very
sessionable
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
when
youre
burned
out
on
biggies
taste
is
nearly
all
roasty
and
cocoa
maltiness
with
a
few
flashes
of
dark
chocolate
it
is
certainly
not
a
sweet
stout
and
has
a
fair
amount
of
hop
bite
on
the
finish
overall
it
is
a
malty
stout
without
alot
of
complexities
but
it
is
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
i
usually
pick
up
at
least
one
sixer
every
december
its
not
a
bad
stout
but
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
tastes
thanks
to
mhewes
for
tossing
this
in
on
a
recent
trade
as
spring
is
already
here
i
figured
it
was
time
to
give
this
one
a
whirl
pours
jet
black
with
about
a
one
finger
head
not
much
lacing
left
as
that
tan
head
erodes
swiftly
a
slight
but
nice
sweet
coffee
aroma
a
sweet
but
backended
bitter
taste
the
bland
of
the
malt
sweetness
almost
seems
countered
by
bitter
lactose
flavor
feels
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
but
definitely
a
drinkable
stout
with
a
subtle
sweet
milk
stout
character
to
it
this
is
a
decent
if
pretty
lightweight
stout
thats
drinkable
but
not
too
complex
drinkable
almost
too
for
a
winter
brew
not
bad
nothing
particularly
special
though
just
an
easydrinking
stout
that
doesnt
have
much
to
it
esp
in
the
body
pours
a
very
dark
brown
amber
that
is
black
until
held
to
the
light
there
is
a
two
finger
tan
head
that
recedes
to
a
thick
ring
and
thin
cover
the
smell
is
of
licorice
bitter
coffee
roasted
malts
dark
fruits
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
taste
is
roasted
malts
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
sweetness
from
the
dark
fruits
balances
out
the
bitter
roasted
malt
and
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
still
silky
and
creamy
drinkability
is
great
for
such
a
cold
night
not
an
alcohol
bomb
but
helped
warm
me
up
overall
tasty
but
relatively
mild
flavors
easy
to
drink
would
have
another
nothing
awesome
but
a
serviceable
stout
id
have
again
gets
better
as
it
warms
this
is
a
just
above
average
stout
that
definitely
resembles
a
winter
warmer
the
smell
of
light
chocolate
hit
me
as
i
took
my
first
sip
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
quite
drinkable
but
reminded
more
of
a
porter
than
a
stout
djust
a
tad
bit
warm
on
the
alcohol
which
could
be
more
hidden
but
very
drinkable
d
i
rarely
dislike
darker
beers
but
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
beer
again
it
reminded
me
of
kahlua
liquor
if
only
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
looked
again
im
getting
more
of
a
porter
vibe
from
this
beer
especially
with
respect
to
the
mouthfeel
which
is
highly
carbonated
and
has
a
tangy
porteresque
zing
flavors
of
light
chocolate
roasted
cocoa
beans
and
a
finish
of
dark
peppery
spices
despite
missing
the
style
this
isnt
in
any
way
a
bad
beer
i
suppose
it
goes
well
with
the
lighter
texas
winters
but
i
like
a
little
more
meat
on
my
stouts
d
this
beer
has
the
tastes
of
a
stout
that
i
especially
want
in
the
the
cold
dark
winter
but
it
doesnt
have
the
body
to
back
up
the
flavor
profile
better
on
draft
despite
this
it
is
a
quality
tasting
ale
from
texas
and
worth
a
try
if
youre
here
to
get
it
this
is
a
mighty
chocolatey
stout
it
feels
like
a
baby
brother
to
choklat
except
not
quite
as
bitter
and
more
heavily
carbonated
not
overly
sweet
all
i
can
really
taste
is
the
chocolate
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
for
balance
also
seems
to
cloy
a
bit
with
a
slightly
medicinal
taste
for
me
its
a
little
thin
in
the
middle
for
a
stout
its
not
a
real
heavy
body
at
all
drinkability
is
helped
along
by
the
carbonation
overall
i
like
the
chocolatey
taste
and
that
is
the
saving
grace
without
that
flavor
theres
nothing
for
me
to
like
here
i
dont
know
if
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
again
but
i
like
it
ok
enough
drinkability
very
drinkable
but
this
beer
is
to
fizzy
and
carbonated
for
my
taste
i
would
also
have
liked
to
taste
more
flavor
especially
the
chocolate
that
you
can
smell
black
ruby
highlights
obviously
maybe
a
bit
thin
looking
but
pretty
none
the
less
brown
head
with
soft
lacing
roasty
aroma
a
bit
of
coffee
bean
more
coffee
in
the
flavor
some
where
between
dry
and
sweet
a
sweet
dryness
definitely
dry
in
the
back
very
nicely
balanced
again
a
bit
thin
with
the
mouthfeel
overall
though
nice
to
sip
on
i
could
have
a
few
for
sure
and
will
this
brew
pours
up
a
solid
dark
brown
with
a
decent
tan
head
nice
lacing
too
in
the
nose
i
get
bread
dough
from
the
yeast
roasted
malts
cocoa
powder
dark
chocolate
i
taste
sweet
chocolate
malts
toasted
grain
burnt
wood
slight
hop
bittering
piney
hops
in
that
order
medium
bodied
medium
spritzy
carbo
my
favorite
of
the
saint
arnold
line
up
besides
the
divines
d
a
decent
brew
id
prefer
a
little
less
bitterness
notes
needs
more
hops
and
dry
malts
to
balance
the
sweetness
still
there
are
not
enough
regular
stouts
available
to
suit
my
taste
and
saint
arnolds
beer
is
a
welcome
one
lower
the
chocolate
malt
and
use
less
attenuative
yeast
and
this
one
will
get
better
d
if
youre
a
fan
of
malt
this
goes
down
great
very
easy
to
sip
d
very
good
sweet
and
filling
yet
dry
and
clean
overall
another
great
winter
seasonal
from
saint
arnold
i
usually
dont
like
beers
that
have
any
kind
of
chocolate
or
caramel
flavoring
but
this
beer
has
just
enough
to
be
good
not
overpowering
at
all
throw
in
the
hops
and
it
makes
this
a
very
solid
beer
from
saint
arnold
d
nice
stout
a
little
too
roasty
for
me
d
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
most
part
fairly
easy
to
drink
a
little
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
but
overall
its
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
black
colored
body
with
a
light
tan
head
small
and
quickly
diminishing
has
an
aroma
of
malts
some
nuttiness
and
chocolate
fizzy
palate
coffee
and
chocolate

a

stout

to
phawk
for
a
few
of
these
traded
at

d
not
a
bad
stout
all
around
a
bit
thin
but
the
flavor
is
good
id
drink
it
again
not
bad
but
the
major
downfall
is
the
airiness
of
the
mouthfeel
thanks
to
turbine2475
for
including
this
beer
in
a
trade
and
giving
me
a
chance
to
try
it
pours
chestnut
brown
with
an
okay
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
smells
lightly
roasty
somewhat
more
like
a
brown
ale
than
a
stout
a
touch
of
cherry
and
plum
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
is
similar
but
with
a
nice
biscuity
chocolate
on
the
the
finish
as
well
as
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
the
same
roastiness
is
there
as
well
and
a
bit
deeper
flavored
than
the
smell
might
suggest
a
bit
light
in
body
but
nice
quite
drinkable
toasty
and
nice
d
not
a
terrible
beer
by
any
means
just
not
a
favortie
of
mine
fairly
easy
to
drink
though
notes
nothing
too
fancy
here
but
very
solid
thanks
to
jonathanl7890
for
tossing
this
in
as
an
extra
drinks
pretty
good
but
a
little
too
much
coffee
for
me
to
session
on
overall
not
bad
at
all
not
the
best
stout
i
have
had
but
it
would
work
in
a
pinch
cant
say
i
would
recommend
seeking
it
out
but
it
is
certainly
not
one
to
avoid
at
all
drinkability
aside
from
the
green
taste
this
would
be
a
good
beer
i
was
disappointed
to
taste
the
weirdness
not
worth
trying
i
wont
get
this
one
again
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
poured

opaque
dark
brown
with
deep
red
highlights
halfinch
off
white
head
dissipated
almost
immediately
yielding
a
thin
skim
and
then
nothing
some
watery
lacing
during
the
tasting
but
zero
adherence
scent
of
coffee
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
taste
similar
to
nose
with
coffee
slightly
more
pronounced
but
all
and
all
pretty
bland
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
and
finish
is
a
bit
chalky
average
drinkability
not
what
i
would
consider
a
go
to
beer
a
little
light
on
the
mouthfeel
not
substantial
almost
a
little
watery
the
light
body
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
not
a
huge
stout
but
it
would
be
a
good
dark
session
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
good
stout
from
a
brewery
made
up
of
really
good
people
it
is
not
the
best
stout
i
have
had
but
it
ranks
pretty
highly
on
my
list
pours
almost
black
but
lets
in
a
touch
of
light
big
tan
head
but
fades
very
quickly
smell
is
of
coffee
dark
roast
malt
and
a
hint
of
a
cardboard
too
taste
is
sweet
dark
roasty
malt
mildly
bittered
with
a
somewhat
sweet
roasty
finish
medium
bodied
and
more
carbonated
than
ideal
for
a
stout
but
its
easy
drinking
and
actually
doesnt
taste
that
bad
honestly
expected
worse
and
this
is
a
decent
beer
all
around
but
no
great
standout
qualities
really
either
verdict
this
a
truly
a
brilliant
example
of
an
american
stout
with
the
added
bonus
of
being
local
i
really
wish
saint
arnold
would
brew
this
yearround
but
they
say
the
demand
is
not
there
what
a
shame
pours
out
a
straightup
ruby
body
with
a
thin
head
that
fizzles
out
to
just
a
ring
of
bubbles
smells
of
some
roastiness
milk
chocolate
and
gummy
worms
the
weird

candy
esters
are
going
wild
on
this
one
really
overpowers
a
lot
of
the
chocolate
and
roast
overbearing
in
the
aftertaste
more
stout
characteristics
come
out
its
too
bad
i
have
to
wade
through
the
actual
taste
of
the
beer
to
get
to
the
decent
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thinnish
with
a
bit
of
harsh
carbonation
scraping
against
my
tongue
not
all
too
drinkable
poured
black
with
red
edges
and
looked
a
little
bit
thin
on
the
pour
decent
off
white
head
that
dissipates
failry
quick
not
a
ton

roasted
flavor
and
fruittiness
maybe

taste
was
fruitier

i
expected
mild
roasted

flavor
light
coffee
light

with
some
cherry
and
some
citrus
fruit
flavors
low

hops
but
add
to
the
citrus
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
kind
of
thin
in
the
mouth
decent
carbonation
and
crisper
than
most
stouts
very
drinkable
not
the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
but
good
and
a
little
different
take
on
the
style
great
for
a
weekday
beer
with
the
lower
abv
enjoyed
it
d
a
decent
stout
that
is
a
great
alternative
to
any
guiness
drinker
that
wants
to
try
a
crisp
beer
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
a
good
stout
and
tasty
too
as
previously
stated
this
beer
is
all
about
the
malts
it
starts
with
great
malt
taste
that
fades
into
some
dark
fruits
and
mild
chocolates
the
aftertaste
is
all
malt
this
beer
tastes
as
fresh
as
a
beer
brewed
just
the
other
day
and
thats
a
good
thing
in
this
case
it
has
a
fresh
mouthfeel
and
taste
that
inspires
you
to
drink
more

overall
not
a

the

it
should
be
and
the
roast
could
be
a
bit
more
up
front
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
any
down
overall
this
brew
is
not
a
complete
failure
but
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
that
there
are
several
things
that
could
use
some
fine
tunning
not
a
half
bad
brew
though
as
some
part
of
me
does
actually
like
it
even
though
its
not
the
best
example
of
what
a
good
stout
should
be

to
wasatch

this
sample
of
another
nice
brew
from

nice
clear
dark

lasted
awhile
not
much

afterwards
the
nose
is
of

roasted

the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
malty

stout
true
to

not

i
wont
go
into
depth
w
a
description
of
the
beer
since
so
many
others
have
done
so
quite
accurately
ill
simply
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
its
incredibly
smooth
creamy
and
a
bit
lighter
than
is
typical
appearance
is
black
with
ruby
at
the
edges
a
medium
brown
head
that
settles
to
a
cap
and
laces
well
smells
is
pretty
straightforward
roasted
grains
chocolate
some
raisin
taste
starts
with
a
bit
of
roast
and
transitions
into
a
strong
chocolatey
finish
pretty
light
bodied
for
a
stout
but
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
overall
an
easy
drinking
stout
that
isnt
strong
enough
to
put
you
under
and
is
tasty
enough
to
bring
you
back
for
more
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
front
label
has
a
notch
on
the
side
indicating
the
month
brewed
december
in
this
case
the
color
was
a
dark
dark
brown
basically
black
with
just
a
hint
of
mahogany
when
held
right
to
the
light
it
has
a
couple
fingers
of
head
that
slowly
dissipated
to
constant
film
with
some
lacing
mouthfeel
was
really
good
with
a
smooth
creamy
bite
the
aroma
was
roasted
malts
with
coffee
and
chocolate
but
was
not
very
strong
overall
the
taste
was
incredibly
smooth
it
starts
with
a
malty
bite
that
jumps
right
into
a
smooth
chocolately
finish
this
may
not
be
the
best
tasting
stout
out
there
but
something
about
it
justs
hits
the
spot
perfectly
if
you
told
me
that
id
find
a
stout
session
beer
i
would
never
have
believed
you
for
me
most
stouts
are
a
once
and
while
beer
but
i
ready
to
crack
open
another
one
of
these
right
away
this
is
now
my
favorite
st
arnold
by
far
only
wish
it
was
available
year
round
highly
recommend
4
75
hr
t
y
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
high
on
the
malts
without
being
too
powerfully
bitter
seems
dangerously
close
to
the
irish
dry
stout
style
recommended
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
forming
a
12
inch
tan
head
that
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
mostly
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
is
that
expected
from
a
stout
roasted
malts
and
coffee
flavoring
medium
mouthfeel
a
very
tasty
stout
and
an
easy
session
beer
for
those
cold
winter
nights
by
far
my
favorite
offering
from
saint
arnold
try
this
one
before
the
season
ends
lightweight
stout
but
still
a
decent
brew
i
would
call
it
a
porter
a
pleasing
and
exceptionally
tasty
winter
treat
from
saint
arnold
this
is
on
their
top
echelon
of
beers
i
highly
recommend
it
overall
i
have
to
say
i
like
it
definitely
above
average
a
decent
stout
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
expected
a
little
more
body
and
robustness
in
a
winter
stout
overall
very
nice
stout
more
complex
than
i
expected
quite
enjoyable
cheers2beers
this
is
st
arnolds
winter
special
beer
the
appearance
was
exceptional
a
beautiful
dark
stout
the
smell
was
average
at
best
the
tast
was
strong
with
limited
bitterness
overall
the
drinkability
was
phenomenal
probably
one
of
st
arnolds
best
seasonals
only
falling
short
of
teh
summer
pils
arguably
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
so
my
review
reflects
my
enjoyment
of
the
beer
more
than
whether
or
not
it
really
fits
into
a
traditional
stout
category
poured
a
deep
dark
ruby
colour
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
chocolate
and
coffee
aromas
tart
almost
sour
to
start
finishes
dry
and
with
a
slightly
bitter
chocolate
flavour
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
perhaps
a
little
watery
okay
for
once
and
awhile
but
not
a
stout
that
i
would
drink
very
often
opinion
i
think
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
this
year
it
is
quite
under
carbonated
so
this
makes
it
come
across
the
palate
as
rather
heavy
with
some
serious
accent
on
the
roast
grains
it
is
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
solid
winter
stout
from
sa
this
year
forget
about
color
head
sizeduration
this
stout
delivers
this
stout
has
a
dark
brown
color
and
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
and
very
pleasant
aroma
and
taste
the
aroma
is
malty
it
is
sweeter
than
many
other
stouts
and
finishes
with
a
slight
bitterness
that
may
not
please
fans
of
dry
stouts
however
since
the
sweetness
subsumes
the
dryness
a
lot
of
subtle
flavors
can
be
detected
notably
caramel
coffee
and
dark
liquorish
a
mild
after
taste
lingers
for
a
few
seconds
due
to
a
watery
texture
that
leaves
your
palate
warm
and
refreshed
the
saint
arnold
winter
stout
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
moderate
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
strong
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
the
aroma
translates
very
well
to
the
flavor
which
is
roasty
and
sweet
with
a
slight
hoppy
finish
this
stout
does
have
a
sweet
character
but
this
is
not
a
sweet
stout
the
roasted
malt
gives
the
beer
a
dry
character
that
overpowers
the
sweetness
for
a
winter
stout
i
would
like
the
alcohol
to
be
a
little
more
pronounced
or
at
least
have
a
warming
character
however
this
is
a
tasty
beer
this
beer
pours
a
rubied
dark
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
a
mix
of
coffee
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
coffee
bitter
but
slightly
chocolate
sweet
on
the
finish
the
feel
is
not
quite
as
thick
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
just
at
moderate
this
is
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
but
i
want
a
little
less
drinkability
in
my
stouts
i
want
to
have
it
be
thick
and
coating
so
i
sip
it
more
and
drink
it
less
still
not
a
bad

full
enough
to
be
great
everything
seems
just
a
little
light
here

may
actually
increase

this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
lacks
a
richness

is
needed

a

i
think
this

suffers
from
its

its
really
a

not

to

it

very

one
of
the
first
things
you
notice
besides
the
lack

is
the
sweet
chocolate

coffee
smells
these

are
also
the
most
noticeable
flavors
you
find
while
drinking
this
brew
lots
of
roasted

dark

this
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
just
really
wish
it
had
a
little
more
carbonation

overall
not

bottom
line
a
pretty
good
stout
this
is
the
second
time
im
having
this
stout
and
it
seems
a
bit
different
from
the
first
especially
the
aroma
a
nutty
caramel
aroma
is
still
there
but
a
stale
sour
odor
dominates
it
the
heavy
roasted
malt
flavors
hold
more
than
their
own
against
the
slightly
spicy
hops
a
gentle
moderate
carbonation
gave
it
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
not
as
smooth
as
i
had
remembered
it
would
be
more
drinkable
if
the
aroma
wasnt
so
off
thanks
morris729
for
the
sample
saint
arnold
winter
stout
pours
with
a
black
body
ruby
in
the
light
with
an
annoyingly
fastdissipating
head
characteristic
of
all
saint
arnold
beers
the
nose
smells
of
burnt
sugar
sweetened
café
au
lait
and
belgian
aromatic
malts
the
last
of
which
really
lends
a
nice
aroma
to
this
beer
unfortunately
i
poured
too
much
of
the
carbonation
out
of
this
beer
while
trying
to
raise
a
head
so
the
body
was
a
little
thinner
than
i
know
it
to
be
the
result
was
that
the
roasted
malts
last
time
i
spoke
with
brock
wagner
at
saint
arnold
they
used
no
roasted
barley
in
the
stoutchocolate
and
black
malts
only
created
a
slightly
astringent
sour
flavor
in
the
finish
other
than
that
this
sweet
stout
was
pretty
enjoyable
and
better
than
mackesons
though
saint
arnold
uses
no
lactosesweet
roasty
smooth
and
uncomplex
nearly
black
with
clear
deep
burgundy
hue
when
held
to
light
the
initially
thick
head
settles
readily
into
a
spotty
dark
tan
layer
sparse
foam
aggregates
remain
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
chocolate
malt
and
smooth
mildly
smokey
roasted
grain
with
sweetness
provided
by
dark
caramel
trace
butterscotch
chocolate
laced
sugary
sweetness
hits
the
palate
at
first
then
is
briefly
superceded
by
grainy
tartness
which
quickly
diminishes
sweetness
reemerges
in
the
form
of
molassestinged
brown
sugar
and
couples
with
the
mild
chocolate
malt
undertone
lending
token
richness
paltry
hop
bitterness
leaves
malt
sweetness
unhindered
lightly
bodied
passably
dextrinous
mouthfeel
finishes
mostly
clean
with
a
fading
impression
of
powered
glucose
and
cocoa
not
a
particularly
rich
or
complex
stout
and
somewhat
one
dimensionally
sweet
its
cleanliness
stately
roasted
malt
character
and
lack
of
flaws
lend
it
good
drinkability
a
touch
too
sweet
to
be
a
great
session
stout
thanks
to
txhops
for
sending
the
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
perhaps
black
color
with
garnet
highlights
it
produced
a
small
tan
head
that
was
very
short
lived
but
leaves
a
nice
layer
providing
a
cover
for
the
brew
light
aromas
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
smell
quite
nice
the
flavor
mirrors
the
smell
with
the
chocolate
being
dominant
followed
by
the
roasted
malt
hops
and
finishes
with
a
burnt
bitter
taste
this
beer
is
too
thin
imho
and
it
finishes
just
slightly
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
the
only
flaw
that
i
can
find
but
when
you
are
not
dissecting
a
beverage
the
mouthfeel
can
affect
the
taste
as
in
this
case
it
is
still
a
pretty
decent
brew
and
since
its
made
in
texas
ill
continue
to
support
them
cheers
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
definitely
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
one
but
if
i
had
to
choose
a
stout
i
would
definitely
go
with
one
of
the
youngs
stouts
this
is
an
excellent
seasonal
stout
with
hints
of
christmas
buried
deep
within
the
hops
and
malts
are
blended
well
to
give
s
surprisingly
good
finish
to
this
beer
the
head
is
not
very
creamy
and
is
a
brown
foam
when
poured
it
settles
pretty
quick
and
leaves
you
wondering
what
you
just
got
in
the
way
of
a
stout
the
initial
taste
is
surprisingly
good
and
so
is
the
last
an
excellent
and
matured
stout
that
has
the
harshness
taken
off
by
a
proper
fermentation
that
is
not
speed
up
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
colored
head
that

dissipates

is
dominated
by
sweet
roasted
malts
and
grains
with
notes
of

dark
coffee

chocolate
come
through
in
the
taste
not
a
great
stout
but
one
of
the
better
texas
brewed
stouts
ive
tried
o
this
is
a
decent
stout
big
coffee
flavor
but
for
me
a
little
too
big
it
lacks
something
perhaps
a
complexity
that
other
stouts
have
its
definitely
a
beer
that
i
would
have
no
problem
sitting
back
with
on
a
cold
winter
night
overall
good
stout
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
that
i
drank
but
the
coffee
flavor
can
dominate
o
average
re
drinkable
but
the
type
i
wouldnt
go
out
and
pick
up
more
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
its
ok

drinkable

i
like
coffee
heavy
beers

there
is
enough
coffee
to
satisfy
coffee
lovers
but
not
too
much
to
turn
off

who
arent

d
very
drinkable
good
coffee
stout
nice
balance
of
roasted
coffee
flavors
with
a
stout
base
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
it
has
a
jet
black
body
with
a
small
tan
head
that
lays
down
quickly
to
a
nice
lace
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
and
some
coffee
notes
the
taste
does
have
coffee
on
the
front
of
the
tonuge
also
has
a
roasted
malt
taste
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
with
a
little
bit
of
a
coffee
after
taste
on
the
tongue
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
one
is
enough
for
me
pours
jet
black
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
dry
roast
coffee
in
the
taste
dry
coffee
with
notes
of
roast
and
lactose
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
coffee
and
small
sweet
lactose
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
coffee
balance
with
a
nice
roasty
malt
nothing
worth
seeking
out
a
very
average
coffee
stout

let
some

in

with
this
as

enjoy
with
another

a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
finger
length
tan
head
that
shrinks
to
nothing

leaves
decent

aroma

very

is

stout
a
says

for

in
a

which
is
odd
because
she
doesnt

for
chocolate
i
could
not
pick
up
any
roasted

patent
chocolate

or
anything
just

dark
black
with
some
foam
at
onset
to
a
small
layer
strong
espresso
and
coffee
bean
smell
really
roasted
coffee
taste
and
a
strong
coffee
finish
smooth
chocolate
malt
in
between
more
coffee
than

bitter
finish
nice
new
stout
like
final
thought
below
6
abv
and
nothing
amazing
this
one
is
kept
for
the
christmas
season
pours
dark
chestnut
bordering
on
ebony
a
decent
sized
mocha
head
was
achieved
with
a
vigorous
pour
and
left
appreciable
lacing
the
aroma
is
primarily
coffee
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
flavor
matches
the
smell
though
i
find
it
to
be
very
onedimensional
the
coffee
flavor
is
closer
to
your
generic
cup
of
joe
as
opposed
to
any
fancy
artisinal
brew
this
lends
an
ascerbic
element
to
the
coffee
that
i
dont
particularly
enjoy
yet
appears
all
too
common
in
coffee
themed
beers
this
wouldnt
be
too
much
of
a
problem
if
there
were
stronger
supporting
flavors
to
shoulder
the
load
but
unfortunately
bitter
black
coffee
is
the
only
prominent
taste
maybe
if
you
look
hard
you
can
find
some
milk
chocolate
in
there
and
a
meager
dose
of
hops
but
on
the
whole
there
is
a
surprising
lack
of
substance
for
the
style
this
isnt
a
terrible
brew
in
that
it
is
technically
drinkable
but
theres
not
much
to
relish
in
a
thin
bitter
onedimensional
stout
overall
a
decent
coffee
beer
no
overwhelmingly
strong
flavors
but
fairly
well
balenced
wish
it
was
sweeter
and
had
a
more
solid
beer
base
brew
is
good
and
sessionable
and
has
some
different
things
going
on
other
than
what
you
would
you
would
expect
from
a
straight
up
coffee
stout
good
solid
brew
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
chewy
and
thick
though
good
though
o
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
it
is
nice
to
have
a
solid
stout
with
the
coffee
addition
vs
a
ris
with
coffee
i
like
those
also
this
makes
me
want
to
brew
a
sweet
stout
with
coffee
something
i
would
not
have
thought
of
before
having
this
beer
i
would
not
reach
for
this
all
the
time
but
i
have
enjoyed
the
couple
out
of
the
mixed
pack
i
would
definitely
pick
up
a
sixer
next
fallwinter
m
solid
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
coffee
stout
does
not
disappoint
if
youre
craving
a
brew
that
tastes
like
coffee
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
12
inch
foamy
tan
head
leaving
a
good
amount
of
lacing
along
the
glass
the
smell
is
bitter
chocolatey
sweet
the
taste
is
also
bitter
with
hints
of
molasses
caramel
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
towards
the
end
the
flavors
dissipate
a
bit
and
youre
left
with
basically
just
the
bitterness
although
most
like
to
pair
a
coffee
or
oatmeal
stout
with
dessert
im
more
along
the
lines
of
pairing
these
types
of
stouts
and
imperial
stouts
with
a
good
burger
id
have
this
one
again
if
i
was
eating
a
burger
or
maybe
as
an
afterdinner
brew
but
its
definitely
a
novelty
beer
imo
as
opposed
to
a
truly
great
stout
an
intense
coffee
experience
that
i
would
classify
as
an
after
dinner
dessert
beer
probably
wont
agree
with
everyone
but
i
thought
it
was
very
enjoyable
had
this
around
the
holiday
season
and
it
was
a
decent
sipping
beer
it
tasted
and
finished
really
good
i
wana
try
it
on
tap
and
see
if
there
is
a
difference
then
the
bottle
i
enjoy
most
of
sam
adams
beer
this
one
ill
enjoy
again
im
sure
o
another
nice
offering
in
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
there
are
richer
and
more
flavorful
coffee
stouts
out
there
and
i
wouldnt
be
thrilled
or
disappointed
if
this
was
around
next
year
nice
change
of
space
but
nothing
special
o
the
flavor
cant
live
up
to
the
nose
but
it
is
still
a
tasty
coffee
stout
bottle
says
the
finish
has
notes
of
dark
fruit
too
that
would
have
been
nice
oh
well
a
pretty
decent
but
not
great
stout
but
enjoyable
enough
and
worth
having
not
going
to
win
any
awards
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
in
the
future
incredibly
drinkable
but
this
one
is
a
little
one
dimensional
the
coffee
dominates
the
stage
front
and
center
without
much
to
back
it
up
taste
follows
suit
maybe
a
touch
sweeter
than
expected
moderate
quality
coffee
more
drip
than
press
or
espresso
healthy
dose
of
cream
and
sugar
dry
cocoa
powder
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
not
overly
complex
but
easy
drinking
medium
bodied
a
touch
thin
for
the
style
would
have
liked
a
little
more
heft
or
coating
a
nice
approachable
coffee
stout
for
the
masses
overall
this
is
actually
a
pretty
tasty
cofee
stout
i
remember
the
1st
time
i
tried
it
was
back
during
the
tasters
choice
in
08
or
09
this
lost
out
to
the
blackberry
wheat
i
dont
know
why
i
think
this
is
a
much
better
beer
its
an
excellent
addition
to
the
winter
classic
pack
in
my
opinion
o
pretty
much
what
i
expected
from
a
sam
adams
stout
drinkable
but
not
otherworldly
o
drinkable
if
you
like
black
coffee
which
is
ok
in
moderation
make
sure
to
serve
this
at
the
proper
temp
overall
a
very
good
choice
for
anyone
with
a
different
outlook
on
what
they
want
from
their
beer
definately
an
a
plus
for
any
stout
fan
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
try
this
is
a
definite
must
try
during
the
holiday
season
o
pretty
typical
for
a
sam
adams
nothing
too
ambitious
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
but
unique
in
its
own
right
wish
it
would
have
had
a
bigger
body
and
more
alcohol
but
overall
not
bad
pours
out
a
dark
brown
so
deep
in
color
it
passes
for
black
until
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
tan
colored
head
with
some
decent
retention
but
only
mediocre
lacing
levels
nice
bitter
chocolate
presence
but
the
real
show
stealer
is
the
amazingly
fresh
coffee
flavor
and
aroma
that
upstages
everything
texture
is
perhaps
a
wee
bit
thinner
than
it
ought
to
be
for
such
bold
and
aggressive
flavoring
but
the
carbonation
is
alright
memorable
for
having
an
extremely
fresh
and
delicious
coffee
flavor
emphasis
that
outshines
the
weaker
roasted
malts
in
the
background
its
very
strong
and
tasty
and
would
go
great
with
some
eggs
and
bacon
after
a
long
night
of
drinking
overall
a
solid
coffee
stout
one
that
could
be
overlooked
if
one
only
looks
at
imperials
but
should
be
appreciated
on
its
own
level
overall
this
beer
showed
a
lot
of
promise
but
didnt
fully
deliver
still
it
is
a
very
good
stout
and
for
coffee
stouts
its
one
of
the
best
ive
had
the
acidity
that
the
coffee
brings
isnt
the
most
pleasant
addition
to
the
beer
but
the
flavor
is
nice
the
body
is
good
and
the
look
is
magnificent
appearance
pours
a
very
dark
brown
having
a
easily
dissipating
head
leaving
nil
lace
smell
of
roasted
maltcoffee
chocolate
and
creamer
taste
of
the
coffee
maybe
more
of
chocolate
covered
coffee
beans
roasted
malt
with
light
caramel
and
dark
fruits
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
it
has
a
nice
flavor
of
coffee
thats
enjoyable
for
coffee
lovers
that
has
a
little
alchohol
involved
pours
a
very
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
mild
light
brown
head
scent
is
mostly
of
robust
malts
and
cocoa
not
too
much
of
a
coffee
scent
taste
is
rather
mild
for
a
stout
starts
off
with
a
bold
cocoacoffee
flavor
but
finishes
rather
clean
with
not
much
of
an
after
taste
rather
smooth
and
filling
making
for
a
great
sipping
stout
poured
a
dark
black
color
with
a
one
finger
caramel
colored
head
which
disappeared
quickly
smell
of
dark
coffee
roasted
malts
and
a
kiss
of
vanilla
medium
carbonation
which
fizzles
in
the
palate
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
this
style
of
beer
tastes
of
strong
coffee
grains
and
light
chocolates
sweet
and
bitter
which
balances
out
okay
but
leaves
the
palate
feeling
a
bit
slimey
overall
this
is
not
bad
but
it
is
not
great
probably
wont
buy
again
drinkability
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
oneoffs
ive
had
worth
its
one
carton
in
my
opinion
o
a
drinkable
brew
that
is
smooth
has
light
mellow
flavor
and
some
balance
it
does
not
knock
socks
off
but
it
is
drinkable
an
opaque
brownblack
colored
stout
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
that
clears
to
more
of
filmy
ring
with
good
signs
of
lacing
the
nose
picks
up
a
firm
coffee
scent
somewhat
kaluha
i
think
cocoa
as
well
the
flavor
says
lots
more
coffee
bitter
grounds
and
a
touch
of
charcoal
softened
by
mild
chocolate
wash
i
pick
up
the
usual
bit
of
prune
darkness
with
peppery
edges
body
is
mediumplus
with
a
smooth
but
somewhat
chalky
feel
carbonation
is
quite
modest
but
adequate
making
for
an
overall
good
coffee
beer
sammy
a
has
done
it
again
sob
this
is
a
good
beer
the
black
brew
pours
a
nearly
opaque
deep
rich
amber
with
ecru
head
that
is
lacing
the
smell
is
espresso
with
hints
of
semi
sweet
choclate
the
taste
is
like
a
mochacinno
delight
espresso
with
chocolate
i
luv
when
a
brewer
hits
his
mark
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
taste
beer
that
really
hit
the
mark
overall
one
of
the
best
samuel
adams
ive
had
well
balanced
and
reminded
me
a
little
of
fbs
good
work
mr
adams
cheers
overall
pretty
good
a
coffee
forward
stout
that
looks
and
smells
really
good
and
taste
so
so
a
good
addition
to
the
holiday
sampler
o
this
is
a
solid
coffeedominated
brew
from
sam
adams
i
thought
the
taste
was
pretty
good
but
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
is
what
stands
out
for
me
this
beer
is
definitely
a
worthy
addition
to
the
winter
classics
variety
pack
and
one
that
i
would
enjoy
having
again
oits
ok
but
i
really
dont
think
id
search
it
out
again
overall
a
nice
change
of
pace
im
just
starting
to
learn
to
enjoy
a
stout
now
and
then
a
decent
attempt
by
sam
adams
at
a
coffee
stout
the
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
bodied
with
brisk
enough
carbonation
that
this
feels
pleasurable
yet
still
smooth
and
mildly
creamy
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
dry
though
a
bit
too
sticky
and
sweet
around
the
periphery
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
very
creamy
this
is
one
of
my
top
35
sa
beers
of
all
time
i
was
really
pleased
with
this
one
i
suspect
this
would
be
a
great
coffee
gateway
beer
as
the
coffee
isnt
in
your
face
but
more
subdued
and
milder
a
great
beer
indeed
great
looking
black
pour
with
a
large
offwhite
head
good
roasty
coffee
and
malt
notes
on
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
also
quite
good
with
a
fairly
complex
journey
of
the
bitter
coffee
and
roast
notes
coming
through
first
then
some
of
the
sweeter
chocolate
malts
come
through
with
a
bit
of
a
creamy
taste
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
creamy
and
has
a
satisfying
amount
of
body
and
the
drinkabilty
is
very
good
overall
a
great
coffee
stout
too
bad
that
the
odds
are
pretty
high
that
its
a
oneoff
o
black
and
brew
is
a
solid
coffee
stout
a
great
addition
to
the
winter
mix
pack
the
black
and
brew
is
quite
enjoyable
o
i
like
this
and
would
get
it
again
but
i
really
like
stouts
and
i
like
coffee
so
its
right
up
my
alley
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
musttry
for
coffee
fans
overall
a
very
good
stout
not
too
light
not
too
heavy
the
coffee
aspect
isnt
overbearing
wellbalanced
and
tasty
o
reminds
me
of
an
iced
coffee
for
some
reason
nice
stout
but
nothing
overpowering
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
black
with
brownish
edges
and
a
creamy
mocha
head
that
settles
to
a
nice
cap
leaving
lots
of
spotty
lacing
sweet
and
rich
aromas
of
coffee
beans
chocolate
cream
and
sugar
really
coffeeforward
but
not
insanely
intense
taste
is
spoton
with
the
nose
sweet
flavors
of
chocolate
and
cream
with
a
pleasantly
bitter
freshground
coffee
character
nicely
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
for
a
coffee
stout
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
mediumthin
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
solid
coffee
stout
that
is
insanely
drinkable
could
be
decent
as
a
dessert
beer
i
guess
if
you
wanted
a
dessert
beer
with
a
very
low
abv
but
who
does
o
not
a
bad
brew
just
too
smokey
in
the
middle
for
what
i
had
expected
and
hoped
for
still
drinkable
and
decent
overall
i
like
this
one
almost
a
lot
this
is
the
first
sam
adams
ive
had
where
i
think
theyve
got
most
of
it
right
most
of
their
other
offerings
have
just
been
ok
but
this
one
gets
a
lot
right
this
was
a
respectable
coffee
stout
i
have
definitely
had
better
but
i
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
this
is
probably
one
of
boston
beers
better
additions
to
their
catalog
o
definitely
a
roasty
coffee
blast
a
little
sweetness
and
dark
fruit
balance
it
out
nicely
not
over
the
top
as
the
smell
might
suggest
overall
not
too
shabby
a
very
welcome
addition
to
the
winter
classics
mix
which
has
always
been
my
favors
sam
adams
variety
this
is
more
coffee
flavor
than
a
stout
with
coffee
taste
i
prefer
the
latter
but
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
beer
and
a
fun
addition
to
this
years
package
theres
just
enough
of
a
hop
balance
to
compliment
this
brews
other
attributes
and
it
is
definitely
boozy
enough
to
make
it
a
very
satisfying
treat
at
the
end
of
the
day
im
a
sucker
for
coffee
stouts
and
this
is
no
exception
a
real
easy
drinker
pours
dark
with
a
moderate
head
its
not
outstanding
in
any
regard
with
your
typical
malty
front
and
bitter
coffee
finish
but
its
overall
just
a
nice
brew
wont
turn
this
one
down
if
offered
but
there
are
better
coffee
stouts
out
there
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
tastier
coffee
flavored
beer
its
a
little
rich
and
sweet
for
quaffing
but
a
nice
nip
from
the
13
oz
bottle
o
very
good
beer
the
abv
is
relatively
low
which
aids
in
making
this
a
highly
drinkable
beer
probably
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
beers
ive
tasted
overall
this
coffee
stout
has
great
flavors
and
really
surprised
me
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
lacking
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
very
solid
coffee
stout
overal
im
happy
and
impressed
with
this
beer
i
dont
understand
the
low
reviews
by
some
its
a
very
good
coffee
stout
d
think
of
this
as
a
desert
beer
not
bad
at
all
but
not
for
guzzling
this
one
had
the
complexities
but
some
of
the
flavors
were
just
not
to
my
liking
m
good
coffee
that
trails
off
into
caramel
and
mild
roast
decent
and
the
coffee
kickoff
as
ive
stated
above
is
worth
it

nice

dry
roasty
plenty
of
coffee
no
astringent
bitterness
creamy
without
feeling
like
there
was
a
lactose
addition
or
other
type
of
adjunct
thrown
in
really
tastes
artisan
in
the
sense
that
it
is
craftfully
done
in
a
simple
and
minimalistic
way
chocolate

roasted
two

done
and
easy
to

very
enjoyable

youre
getting
it

a
bottle
had
a
bottle
tonight
at
a
friends
house
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
light
black
color
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
smell
had
a
nice
aroma
of
rich
coffee
taste
was
fairly
good
for
a
new
sam
adams
attempt
at
a
style
you
could
really
taste
the
flavors
of
the
coffee
which
complimented
well
the
flavors
of
chocolate
from
the
roasted
dark
malt
my
only
knock
on
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
i
felt
it
was
a
bit
too
bitter
and
astringent
not
a
bad
beer
after
all
definitely
a
decent
offering
in
their
winter
mix
pack
a
very
good
coffee
infussed
stout
that
rejects
the
temptation
to
forge
into
imperial
stout
catagories
and
remains
lighter
and
more
drinkable
cheers
d
not
bad
but
not
very
balanced
chocolate
and
espresso
roast
are
ok
but
bitterness
may
be
a
bit
too
much
to
be
completely
enjoyable
i
like
the
addition
to
the
winter
pack
but
its
one
of
my
least
favorite
included
enjoyable
and
i
drank
the
second
bottle
as
my
next
out
of
the
holiday
pack
pours
almost
jet
black
with
a
few
ruby
hints
there
is
less
than
a
finger
worth
of
tan
head
with
no
retention
the
nose
is
complex
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
are
all
present
the
upfront
flavor
is
that
of
a
relatively
light
and
toasty
stout
this
offering
lacks
the
roasted
bite
that
i
really
look
for
in
a
stout
but
it
makes
up
for
that
detriment
with
a
good
combination
of
flavors
some
roast
some
sweet
notes
as
well
as
this
beer
warms
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
becomes
more
noticeable
not
exceptional
but
very
good
o
a
good
stout
not
a
great
one
to
me
it
comes
off
as
a
slightly
watered
down
version
like
they
were
afraid
to
really
commit
to
a
dark
bitter
heavy
beer
its
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
o
liked
it
more
than
i
expected
i
would
typically
not
a
fan
of
coffee
beers
but
this
one
was
ok
this
is
a
desert
beer
and
a
good
pairing
would
be
a
mocha
swirl
cheesecake
tried
this
as
part
of
the
sam
adams
winter
mixed
12
pack
a
solid
addition
definitely
an
improvement
over
the
god
awful
cranberry
lambic
while
the
overall
flavors
are
a
bit
subdue
and
its
a
bit
boring
in
its
overall
taste
its
a
nice
allaround
beer
that
makes
for
a
nice
drinker
the
coffee
taste
is
definitely
present
but
not
overly
strong
by
any
means
a
good
session
beer
and
good
mix
up
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
pack
o
another
very
good
coffee
stout
these
seem
to
have
gone
from
rarities
to
nearly
commonplace
e
g
kona
in
a
short
time
sweetened
black
coffee
up
front
slight
burnt
caramel
a
little
hint
of
dark
fruit
dry
finish
body
is
medium
yet
pretty
creamy
while
the
taste
is
not
as
good
as
the
smell
it
is
still
a
pretty
tasty
offering
from
the
bbc
coffee
is
still
big
but
gets
a
bit
acrid
and
too
roasty
does
not
have
enough
malt
heft
and
sweetness
behind
it
to
back
it
up
that
all
leads
to
a
fairly
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
bitter
finish
but
not
really
from
the
hops
the
coffee
is
fresh
tasting
though
and
the
beer
still
goes
down
smooth
despite
the
heavy
roast
while
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
a
standalone
sixer
of
black
brew
i
think
this
is
a
fine
addition
to
the
winter
mixed
pack
and
would
like
to
see
it
included
again
sometime
o
this
is
a
solid
offering
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
not
overpowering
but
are
very
noticeable
i
probably
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
the
most
i
could
very
easily
down
a
six
pack
of
this
and
be
left
feeling
satisfied
tasteroasted
dark
malt
roasted
coffee
chocolate
smooth
creamy
nice
coffee
flavor
wellbalnced
throughout
o
i
can
say
for
the
first
time
that
the
fezziwigs
were
not
my
favorite
pair
in
the
sams
holiday
pack
this
guy
stole
the
show
and
i
really
hope
they
bring
it
back
next
year
if
you
enjoy
coffee
stouts
this
is
worht
getting
really
enjoy
the
smoothness
of
this
one
though
so
drinkable
a
pretty
darn
good
stout
effort
by
sam
adams
would
probably
buy
this
one
in
a
sixer
to
share
as
its
pretty
drinkable
o
color
me
impressed
with
this
boston
beer
company
brew
it
has
a
nice
look
great
flavor
and
a
great
mouthfeel
this
is
a
solid
brew
overall
not
a
badtasting
brew
at
all
especially
if
youre
one
who
likes
coffee
or
chocolatecovered
expresso
beans
but
otherwise
not
very
interesting
easy
drinking
stout
but
not
the
heartiest
stout
out
there
would
of
liked
more
body
and
stout
flavor
ive
had
beers
where
it
simply
tastes
like
coffee
watered
down
or
added
as
an
afterthought
this
is
not
one
of
those
beers
this
one
is
balanced
and
tasty
i
find
that
many
of
the
beers
made
by
sam
adams
have
very
similar
characteristics
but
the
black
brew
coffee
stout
seemed
to
distinguish
itself
from
the
rest
this
may
not
be
one
of
the
most
exciting
coffee
stouts
on
the
market
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
nonic
glass
served
cool
pours
an
ink
black
body
and
a
nice
dark
tan
head
smells
like
old
coffee
agree
with
alstrom
some
chocolate
creamy
some
bite
at
the
end
and
a
little
boozy
full
and
dry
on
the
palate
overall
i
kind
of
like
this
beer
despite
not
having
a
refined
coffee
flavor
i
would
drink
this
again
and
think
this
is
a
very
nice
winter
breakfast
beer
poured
a
very
nice
dark
brown
near
black
with
some
very
nice
initial
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
went
down
nice
scent
some
good
roasted
grains
and
a
very
nice
coffee
hit
in
the
nose
good
flavors
well
balanced
with
roasted
grains
bittersweet
coffee
flavors
the
tiniest
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
nice
coffee
and
slightly
earthy
bitter
finish
went
down
well
this
is
a
good
coffee
stout
i
surprising
didnt
mind
this
beer
considering
that
i
dont
drink
coffee
ive
never
had
a
beer
so
similar
this
is
not
a
bad
little
coffee
stout
i
like
it
better
than
many
ive
tried
id
get
this
again
if
no
founders
breakfast
stout
was
available
overall
a
brew
that
starts
out
a
little
mild
and
weak
but
finishes
with
a
nice
strong
robust
smoky
coffee
flavor
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
thought
i
might
like
it
a
little
more
than
i
did
but
that
happens
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
it
above
average
would
be
a
good
descriptor
overall
a
very
solid
beer
and
a
nice
complement
to
the
seasonal
mixed
pack
like
most
sam
adams
brews
its
not
going
to
blow
your
mind
but
it
holds
its
own
o
its
a
nice
tasting
beer
in
the
mixed
winter
pack
better
than
the
cranberry
lambic
and
slightly
better
than
the
winter
lager
but
not
as
drinkable
everything
else
in
the
mixer
is
better
imho
o
im
happy
to
see
sam
adams
continuing
to
experiment
with
their
seasonal
cases
and
putting
in
interesting
styles
that
being
said
this
drinks
like
a
light
introductory
coffee
stoutporter
i
love
the
idea
of
giving
this
to
a
person
just
getting
into
craft
as
it
is
a
good
intro
to
the
style
but
for
the
initiated
who
have
sampled
the
likes
of
fbs
and
wake
n
bake
this
brew
will
do
nothing
for
you
d
again
nothing
offensive
but
this
isnt
great
especially
considering
the
competition
in
the
style
o
a
decent
beer
to
have
with
friends
that
are
just
getting
a
taste
for
good
beer
definitely
many
better
coffee
stout
options
taste
of
milk
chocolate
initially
and
somewhat
thin
in
body
in
the
middle
improves
with
a
bit
of
agitation
however
and
yields
a
light
fruity
character
at
that
time
along
with
some
brown
sugar
notes
offers
a
generally
pleasant
roast
character
becoming
a
bit
dry
in
the
end
like
most
samuel
adams
brews
this
one
comes
really
close
to
be
a
home
run
but
falls
just
short
in
some
way
a
welcome
if
unexceptionable
addition
to
one
my
favorite
winter
mixes
final
thought
its
another
solid
sam
adams
beer
and
a
nice
complement
to
the
bbcsa
holiday
pack
which
now
boasts
three
dark
beers
of
the
six
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
big
but
not
too
big
there
is
a
rich
flavor
and
a
bit
of
a
dark
heavy
coffee
flavor
but
the
body
holds
some
of
the
heaviness
but
lets
is
slowly
slip
a
away
giving
a
nice
drinkable
feel
easy
cream
on
the
mouth
with
a
slight
burnt
toast
finish
overall
ok
better
than
i
thought
the
creamy
cousin
if
not
more
so
than
cream
stout
overall
a
slightly
less
than
average
coffee
stout
the
flavors
and
aroma
dont
shout
out
like
they
should
still
havent
found
anything
better
than
boston
lager
from
sam
one
of
bbs
better
brews
and
a
welcome
addition
to
the
winter
classics
pack
overall
this
is
really
good
coffee
stout
its
not
too
sweet
it
definitely
tastes
like
coffee
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
big
up
front
with
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
dominating
the
scene
the
malt
flavor
tastes
a
little
milky
like
a
latte
it
finishes
a
little
thin
and
astringent
detracting
from
the
overall
flavor
a
good
stout
with
some
good
big
flavors
but
one
that
falls
a
little
short
of
great
overall
though
still
enjoyable
to
drink
and
quite
easy
and
with
a
very
good
coffee
presence
i
was
really
let
down
by
this
one
the
look
and
smell
were
very
nice
but
actually
drinking
this
beer
wasnt
as
enjoyable
as
i
had
hoped
its
an
a
brew
for
me
and
a
great
samuel
adams
brew
both
by
the
style
description
and
personal
preferance
overall
impression
a
coffee
beer
more
coffee
and
less
beer
but
its
well
crafted
would
like
to
see
more
american
stout
character
but
the
coffee
flavor
is
well
done
and
works
with
the
style
a
definite
upgrade
to
the
winter
sampler
pack
overall
a
very
solid
stout
from
sam
adams
nicely
roasty
and
robust
beer
is
medium
in
body
mildly
bitter
at
the
end
with
some
mild
chocolate
malt
and
some
coffee
beer
is
fine
for
a
little
coffee
stout
and
id
have
it
again
but
its
not
special
in
anyway
medium
bodied
mildly
sweet
stout
with
coffee
great
smooth
mouthfeel
creamy
and
almost
soothing
how
do
they
do
that
great
substance
to
this
beer
an
extremely
quaffable
stout
tastes
like
it
smellsits
hard
to
come
up
with
a
neat
way
to
describe
something
so
unneat
starts
off
with
raw
nicely
rough
barley
thats
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
this
mellows
out
into
sweeter
malt
near
the
middle
and
then
ending
on
bitter
coffee
the
bodys
nice
and
thick
and
the
balance
is
wonderful
crisp
lots
of
carbonation
too
much
carbonation
to
be
honest
this
still
doesnt
stop
it
from
being
full
bodied
and
nigh
creamy
that
makes
it
halfway
delightful
to
feel
interesting
beer
not
worth
buying
the
winter
classics
pack
just
to
try
this
do
a
fairly
drinkable
coffee
stout
tasty
but
not
as
much
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
as
id
like
o
an
above
average
coffee
stout
and
a
pleasant
addition
to
the
sam
adams
winter
sampler
pack
my
favorite
of
their
seasonal
sampler
mixes
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
holiday
12pack
a
refreshing
additon
to
the
sam
adams
winter
seasonal
pack
this
has
been
a
solid
seasonal
pack
and
the
black
and
brew
on
a
nice
compliment
to
this
years
variety
this
was
a
very
good
beer
i
recommend
this
but
then
you
can
only
get
it
in
the
variety
pack
d
overall
it
was
a
very
drinkable
stout
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
mix
of
the
flavors
and
feel
on
this
one
pours
night
black
with
two
fingers
of
nice
tanoffbrown
head
that
lasts
quite
a
while
initial
aroma
is
of
strong
black
coffee
roasty
and
warm
with
some
chocolate
malt
in
the
back
mouthfeel
is
adequate
coating
but
not
thick
tastes
like
a
cold
glass
of
coffee
backed
by
chocolate
from
the
malt
i
assume
low
levels
of
a
nondescript
hop
bitterness
with
some
coffee
bite
shoring
it
up
the
overall
picture
is
kind
of
weak
it
meets
its
requirements
but
theres
something
missing
all
things
considered
its
average
and
ill
drink
the
second
in
the
mix
pack
if
the
wife
doesnt
shell
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
around
to
it
though
since
im
not
in
a
rush
to
refill
the
glass
o
slightly
above
average
coffee
stout
i
havent
had
any
other
coffee
stouts
before
so
i
would
try
this
again
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
black
color
with
a
brown
creamy
looking
head
on
top
the
lacing
is
minimal
the
rentention
is
decent
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
really
nice
coffee
aroma
with
some
malt
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
full
of
creamy
coffee
flavors
with
a
healthy
amount
of
sweet
dark
malts
the
finish
has
a
good
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
a
little
thin
could
have
been
a
little
thicker
overall
this
beer
was
still
pretty
good
and
i
would
enjoy
having
this
one
again
o
possibly
the
thinnest
stout
ive
ever
had
and
not
too
flavorful
but
still
decent
the
flavor
it
does
have
is
enjoyable
overall
a
pretty
good
coffee
stout
got
this
in
the
winter
12
mix
pack
that
is
a
great
seasonal
pack
that
i
will
buy
every
year
and
this
one
is
good
but
not
the
best
in
the
pack
overall
i
thought
it
was
nicely
balanced
all
around
and
a
good
addition
to
their
yearly
winter
multipack
nothing
too
exciting
or
memorable
but
quite
drinkable
and
much
better
than
past
winter
pack
beer
cranberry
lambic
coffee
and
beer
two
of
my
favorite
things
i
especially
love
strong
black
coffee
so
i
assumed
that
this
would
be
great
its
color
is
absolutely
pitchblack
with
a
thin
chocolate
colored
head
the
aroma
is
less
intense
than
i
expected
although
it
has
some
coffee
scents
roasted
beans
and
some
chocolate
and
grain
character
it
seems
onedimensional
its
a
muted
unassuming
smell
it
doesnt
exactly
wake
you
up
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
redeeming
bitter
highly
roasted
nearly
burnt
flavors
its
a
bit
astringent
but
it
is
also
flavorful
the
intense
deep
roast
is
good
but
could
use
some
balance
the
body
is
less
full
and
rich
than
expected
and
isnt
helped
with
the
astringent
character
overall
this
is
an
okay
brew
but
not
stellar
overall
for
me
this
was
an
average
coffee
stout
but
i
cant
say
it
wasnt
enjoyable
as
part
of
the
winter
pack
i
prefer
this
style
on
a
cold
night
o
honestly
if
you
photoshopped
a
label
and
stuck
coffee
brown
ale
on
this
beer
i
very
well
might
have
rated
it
better
to
call
it
a
stout
really
surprised
me
and
frankly
it
disappointed
me
its
worth
a
try
if
you
bought
the
winterpack
it
comes
with
but
dont
expect
it
to
replace
your
favorite
stouts
o
not
bad
not
great
i
nice
middle
of
the
road
stout
if
there
is
supposed
to
be
a
lot
of
coffee
in
here
i
dont
taste
it
which
is
fine
with
me
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
isnt
very
flavorful
aroma
of
raisin
and
light
cocoa
some
coffee
notes
some
sharp
espresso
and
some
faint
hops
rich
flavor
of
coffee
and
cocoa
upfront
moving
quickly
to
floral
hops
good
balance
of
flavors
good
offsetting
bitterness
but
not
too
harsh
even
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
smooth
and
creamy
i
wouldnt
mind
it
being
a
bit
more
viscous
oits
ok
again
im
not
really
a
coffee
guy
people
who
enjoy
coffee
will
definately
enjoy
it
imo
overall
a
decent
dessert
beer
o
overall
a
decent
stout
its
probably
my
favorite
from
the
mix
pack
next
to
the
chocolate
bock
hopefully
they
make
this
a
six
pack
its
pretty
good
it
would
sell
im
sure
of
it
o
i
tend
to
be
a
defender
of
the
boston
beer
companys
efforts
but
this
one
does
not
do
a
thing
for
me
the
best
part
of
it
is
the
smell
if
the
body
were
a
bit
thicker
and
the
carbonation
less
forceful
i
might
be
inclined
to
give
this
beer
a
better
review
overall
not
bad
a
bit
too
milky
and
creamy
almost
like
it
has
nitro
but
not
quite
decent
coffee
and
milk
chocolate
light
and
drinkable
overall
i
actually
quite
enjoy
this
beer
and
i
am
glad
sam
adams
switched
out
the
stupid
white
ale
in
place
of
this
o
felt
this
was
a
nice
solid
brew
not
spectacular
but
id
drink
it
again
good
flavor
profile
and
drinkability
overall
other
readers
dont
seem
to
think
this
ranks
well
among
stouts
but
i
think
the
flavor
is
great
i
highly
recommend
it
pretty
good
coffee
is
there
but
subtle
for
the
most
part
o
it
doesnt
have
the
mellow
notes
of
higher
quality
stouts
but
i
like
how
it
smells
the
taste
is
good
but
it
is
deadened
by
that
burnt
coffee
after
taste
its
an
ok
beer
but
i
cant
say
that
i
am
drawn
back
to
this
one
overall
a
great
dessert
beer
sip
and
enjoy
with
a
little
hersheys
kiss
on
the
side
o
yet
again
this
is
another
beer
from
the
bbc
that
is
a
good
gateway
beer
for
the
style
its
not
overly
done
or
exciting
but
its
an
overall
good
beer
worth
picking
up
the
mix
pack
for
this
beer
and
the
other
winter
brews
in
it
i
am
an
irreverent
beer
snob
i
usually
shy
away
from
coffee
beers
because
they
rarely
do
much
for
me
however
two
of
my
fave
sa
beers
only
show
up
in
their
winter
classics
mixer
so
i
bit
the
bullet
i
came
away
pleasantly
surprised
the
body
is
light
with
lots
of
carbonation
this
one
is
drinkable
but
its
underwhelming
weak
flavors
with
that
are
just
a
bit
off
clearly
not
the
star
of
the
variety
pack
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
that
flavor
is
really
nice
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
the
thing
i
liked
about
this
beer
was
that
i
think
it
is
the
first
coffee
stout
i
have
had
that
wasnt
an
imperial
stout
usually
they
are
big
and
boozy
but
i
like
the
approach
of
this
beer
it
kind
of
shows
a
different
side
of
what
a
coffee
stout
can
be
overall
i
think
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
definitely
think
this
one
is
worth
checking
out
i
would
buy
it
again
if
it
came
in
6packs
pours
out
a
black
color
with
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
the
smell
like
a
lot
of
sa
brews
is
kind
of
underwhelming
there
are
some
detectable
coffee
notes
along
with
dark
chocolate
and
liqourice
aromas
the
flavor
is
nice
and
bold
with
big
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
battling
it
out
for
the
predominate
flavor
it
ends
with
a
nice
smokey
finish
to
be
honest
this
brew
reminds
me
a
bit
of
guinness
and
i
dont
typically
make
that
comparison
it
is
just
has
certain
pleasant
smokey
flavor
that
is
nice
to
find
in
a
stout
once
in
a
while
the
hops
provide
some
bitterness
but
not
a
lot
in
the
nose
unfortunately
what
i
really
like
is
how
well
the
coffee
blends
with
the
dark
malts
i
was
afraid
that
i
would
get
a
stale
coffee
taste
from
the
brew
and
i
dont
get
that
at
all
the
coffee
bolsters
the
chocolate
malts
in
a
way
like
eating
a
nice
piece
of
quality
dark
chocolate
with
a
fresh
cup
of
joe
mouthfeel
was
smooth
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
and
it
actually
justified
buying
the
variety
pack
overall
this
is
an
impressive
new
at
least
to
me
offering
from
the
boston
beer
company
and
an
excellent
addition
to
the
alreadygreat
holiday
12
pack
othis
is
a
pretty
good
stout
im
not
much
of
a
coffee
person
but
i
do
somehow
enjoy
some
coffee
stouts
and
this
one
is
pretty
good
final
notes
not
really
a
fan
about
the
only
thing
really
great
about
this
beer
is
the
look
there
are
better
stouts
to
be
had
and
in
my
opinion
this
is
sam
adams
worst
attempt
at
a
stout
ill
drink
it
to
get
rid
of
the
mixed
pack
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
sixer
of
it
overall
not
a
bad
coffee
beer
from
sam
adams
it
does
have
a
fullness
of
body
also
per
label
and
the
carbonation
is
medium
as
a
result
its
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
yes
i
like
again
and
im
glad
theres
more
of
this
in
the
box
well
done
o
not
bad
overall
it
does
ok
in
most
categories
but
only
truly
excels
in
one
which
is
the
appearance
definitely
worth
revisiting
though
dr
a
drinkable
beer
that
is
in
need
of
some
work
but
nonetheless
a
good
one
this
approach
might
work
better
as
a
porter
rather
than
a
stout
id
try
it
on
draught
but
overall
it
really
isnt
special
pricing
is
average
drinkability
is
very
good
i
am
not
a
really
big
coffee
guy
but
this
beer
is
really
good
it
has
nice
coffee
notes
without
being
overpowering
one
of
the
most
balanced
and
drinkable
coffee
stouts
i
have
ever
had
and
would
recommend
anyone
to
try
this
brew
o
great
solid
effort
by
koch
it
is
very
delicious
and
drinkable
and
has
some
well
crafted
flavors
that
play
well
with
each
other
overall
i
dont
like
it
very
much
its
not
bad
or
off
but
not
pleasing
an
okay
drink
it
has
a
robust
coffee
profile
but
it
was
not
balanced
with
the
rest
of
the
stout
smelled
and
looked
great
though
moreys
bottom
line
this
is
a
bit
thinner
than
fbs
and
wnb
but
in
all
fairness
to
sas
this
is
a
stout
not
an
imperial
stout
this
is
really
pretty
well
done
and
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
o
if
you
dont
like
coffee
dont
bother
drinking
this
one
on
the
flip
side
if
you
like
coffee
i
would
recommend
this
one
im
debating
starting
my
morning
with
a
cup
of
this
to
save
time
brewing
a
pot
of
coffee
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
very
good
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
overall
it
was
pretty
good
overall
a
tasty
beer
but
there
are
better
coffee
stouts
out
there
very
drinkable
its
a
heavy
bodied
beer
coats
the
mouth
superbly
as
its
very
sticky
its
a
yummy
beer
that
kept
me
happy
throughout
o
another
winner
from
the
winter
pack
i
am
a
sucker
for
a
coffee
stout
and
while
this
isnt
the
top
it
is
still
a
solid
representation
for
a
low
price
o
this
is
a
nice
coffee
stout
a
good
effort
from
sam
adams
overall
i
was
certainly
impressed
by
sam
adams
on
this
one
its
not
the
best
stout
youll
ever
have
and
there
are
better
coffee
stouts
out
there
but
this
is
a
solid
brew
love
if
they
would
put
this
in
a
sixer
the
only
thing
that
i
wish
were
improved
was
the
body
yes
its
nice
and
smooth
but
it
could
be
thicker
though
im
not
a
fan
of
coffee
i
do
like
how
it
smells
and
the
coffee
element
here
tastes
like
how
it
smells
so
im
good
with
that
for
a
stout
this
is
very
lightbodied
plus
the
vast
bulk
of
the
flavor
is
in
the
aftertaste
kinda
odd
and
not
very
interesting
i
probably
would
not
have
this
beer
ever
again
o
one
of
the
best
coffee
brews
ive
ever
had
and
one
of
sams
finest
offerings
im
a
huge
fan
a
must
try
for
any
coffee
brew
lover
this
would
be
the
perfect
pregamemorning
beer
pours
a
nice
pitch
black
color
with
a
nice
brown
head
laces
well
with
good
head
retention
aroma
is
mild
coffee
grounds
with
some
toasted
malts
and
hints
of
dry
cocoa
powder
the
coffee
kicks
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
and
is
accompanied
by
a
nice
subtle
cocoa
note
and
pleasant
toasted
malts
its
got
a
nice
full
body
and
creaminess
to
it
and
finishes
a
little
dry
overall
i
think
ive
enjoyed
this
the
most
out
of
the
mixed
12
this
year
id
drink
this
year
round
im
talking
to
you
koch
overall
an
ok
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
here
still
pretty
solid
o
i
wont
call
it
mindblowingly
amazing
but
i
will
call
it
a
very
good
borderline
great
session
stout
that
would
make
a
great
alternative
to
guinness
draught
the
only
thing
holding
it
back
is
its
slightly
suspect
mouthfeel
oh
who
cares
its
still
a
must
try
are
you
listening
boston
beer
company
give
us
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
now
kthx
o
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
when
i
heard
about
it
but
now
i
just
wish
i
could
forget
about
it
maybe
ill
use
the
other
bottle
when
i
make
my
24hr
coffee
rubbed
pork
shoulder
i
sure
aint
gonna
drink
it
oa
nice
beer
good
to
see
sa
make
a
stout
as
well
worth
a
try
to
bad
i
think
it
is
limited
to
the
winter
mix
o
a
good
coffee
stout
one
that
i
will
definitely
revisit
because
its
an
extremely
easy
drinker
and
very
full
of
flavor
o
ok
too
thin
in
feel
and
too
onedimensional
in
taste
could
use
a
much
bigger
malt
backbone
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
for
me
it
is
possibly
in
the
realm
of
a
sessionable
stout
overall
the
initial
flavors
present
in
a
single
sip
of
this
beer
are
excellent
the
coffee
flavors
being
strongly
present
and
joined
by
decent
stout
flavors
soon
after
but
the
beer
does
fade
in
its
potency
fairly
quickly
on
the
tongue
and
i
found
myself
wanting
the
espresso
profile
to
last
for
much
longer
over
the
course
of
a
mouthful
as
well
many
of
the
stout
flavors
seem
to
be
light
as
if
a
mediumgrade
stout
had
been
amped
up
with
heavy
aging
the
mouthfeel
is
also
strangely
watery
for
the
potency
of
these
initial
flavors
creating
a
distracting
contrast
still
the
beer
does
deliver
delicious
coffee
flavors
and
is
quite
drinkable
worth
a
try
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
an
active
but
quicksettling
tan
head
aroma
of
freshly
brewed
coffee
with
cream
a
bit
of
vanillacaramel
too
this
one
is
very
wellmade
really
good
coffee
flavors
that
are
sweet
and
robust
not
too
bitter
and
a
really
nice
mild
roasty
flavor
nothing
is
overpowering
or
out
of
line
a
simple
tasty
beer
moderately
heavy
mouthfeel
for
the
abv
nice
finish
allaround
good
stuff
overall
a
pretty
badass
coffee
stout
it
is
an
extremely
solid
example
of
the
style
that
fits
very
well
as
a
winter
seasonal
o
just
average
i
was
really
hoping
this
would
be
better
it
has
a
good
base
but
there
are
some
off
flavors
that
i
didnt
care
for
overall
a
decent
beer
in
this
variety
pack
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
but
two
of
them
are
fine
my
only
gripe
is
mouthfeel
its
actually
too
carbonated
for
this
type
of
brew
i
bet
it
would
be
superb
on
cask
very
good
offering
by
sam
if
you
like
coffee
seek
this
out
o
thinking
sam
adams
did
what
they
wanted
to
do
with
this
one
chocolate
and
coffee
as
for
me
yeah
id
have
it
again
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
nice
addition
to
the
winter
sampler
pack
feels
medium
in
body
with
a
refreshing
almost
dark
chocolate
ice
cream
kind
of
flavor
and
feel
not
a
bad
coffee
beer
imho
overall
i
should
say
that
this
is
the
best
sam
adams
offering
i
have
had
to
date
it
is
a
whole
lot
more
on
the
porter
side
than
stout
but
a
great
beer
for
the
newbies
that
buy
the
winter
sampler
pack
if
they
like
this
they
may
venture
out
and
try
other
crafted
stouts
that
is
a
good
thing
for
all
of
us
the
taste
is
a
little
different
then
the
aroma
the
carbonation
starts
the
flavors
off
filling
the
mouth
and
subsiding
quickly
the
initial
flavor
is
sweet
malt
it
turns
to
stout
with
roasted
flavors
the
coffee
and
roasted
malt
meld
to
form
a
roasted
finish
almost
hints
of
smoke
this
would
be
a
good
brew
to
make
burgers
will
o
not
a
bad
beer
here
if
you
want
coffee
this
is
it
a
little
bit
one
dimensional
but
definitely
a
welcoming
addition
to
the
winter
mix
pack
i
like
this
fairly
well
for
a
lighter
coffee
stout
drink
it
on
the
warmer
side
o
i
like
it
its
twonoted
which
i
appreciate
and
i
really
like
coffee
o
i
like
this
beer
however
it
could
do
with
some
simple
recipe
revisions
that
would
make
it
stellar
bottle
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
dense
medium
to
thick
tan
head
loads
of
roast
deep
coffee
very
roasty
soft
vanilla
sugar
note
caramel
medium
bodied
roast
coffee
chocolate
flavors
sour
finish
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
experience
tastes
more
like
an
irish
dry
stout
the
beer
is
drinkable
but
you
should
drink
it
slow
to
savor
the
flavor
profile
some
might
say
the
beer
is
unfocused
it
tasted
like
a
porter
at
first
before
morphing
into
a
stout
and
then
a
black
lager
but
i
think
the
progression
of
flavors
in
intriguing
not
a
singledimensional
brew
but
do
all
the
dimensions
converge
not
sure
it
works
for
everyone
overall
good
easy
to
drink
and
a
must
for
coffee
fans
just
starting
out
with
stouts
if
russian
stouts
or
double
americans
are
too
much
this
is
a
good
brew
to
try
its
a
little
watery
but
theres
enough
going
on
to
enjoy
and
the
lower
alcohol
makes
it
easy
to
enjoy
a
few
at
a
time
overall
i
thought
it
was
nicely
balanced
all
around
and
a
good
addition
to
their
yearly
winter
multipack
i
hate
to
break
it
to
ya
cranberry
lambic
but
overall
i
really
do
like
this
beer
actually
very
good
for
the
price
if
you
like
this
beer
and
want
a
real
treat
get
a
4pak
of
fbs
a
black
pour
with
a
2finger
tan
head
leaving
a
thick
ring
and
dense
lacing
nose
is
coffee
old
and
oily
coffee
at
that
pretty
one
dimensional
with
some
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
maybe
some
darkfruit
esters
palates
mouthfeel
is
pretty
decent
nice
weight
with
a
roasty
sweetness
and
moderate
bitterness
but
has
an
odd
twang
and
again
with
the
onedimensional
coffee
vibe
overall
i
sought
out
the
2011
sam
adams
winter
classics
pack
because
i
read
a
thread
here
saying
how
good
it
was
guess
it
was
the
limited
availability
that
people
were
hyped
about
cuz
the
porter
and
winter
lager
are
the
only
ones
worth
a
damn
o
not
a
beer
id
buy
on
its
own
but
a
welcome
addition
to
the
seasonal
mix
pack
o
not
bad
at
all
though
i
expected
a
fresh
coffee
flavor
rather
than
a
cooked
grounds
character
there
is
a
slight
bite
on
the
palate
one
bottle
is
enough
and
i
am
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
o
a
decent
stout
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
about
this
beer
but
i
really
like
it
my
wife
tried
it
and
loves
it
and
she
hates
dark
beers
i
wished
sam
adams
sold
this
in
6packs
i
may
buy
again
o
different
strokes
for
different
folks
i
would
say
about
this
one
if
you
are
a
hardcore
coffeeaholic
and
like
lots
of
bitter
coffee
notes
digging
into
your
palate
you
may
not
care
for
this
one
but
if
youre
like
me
and
like
for
the
coffee
to
be
candyized
youll
probably
dig
it
i
think
this
in
one
of
the
best
brews
that
sam
adams
makes
because
of
this
mildness
it
is
inherently
easy
to
drink
but
somewhat
unsatisfying
there
is
no
outstanding
characteristic
i
will
probably
have
more
of
the
holiday
samplers
this
season
but
i
wish
the
lambic
were
still
there
that
and
i
would
buy
a
twelve
of
old
fezziwig
overall
i
dont
go
crazy
for
coffee
stouts
if
theres
a
coffee
flavor
thats
usually
a
good
sign
but
mixing
coffee
and
stout
does
not
a
good
beer
make
this
beers
average
ive
had
better
and
ive
had
worse
overall
a
very
solid
coffee
stout
that
falls
in
line
with
expectations
it
doesnt
have
that
wow
factor
but
is
still
quite
pleasant
to
drink
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
coffee
stout
and
a
good
american
stout
i
find
that
most
coffee
stouts
tend
to
be
bigger
and
more
on
the
imperial
side
of
the
spectrum
so
i
liked
the
fact
that
sam
adams
chose
to
use
an
american
stout
as
the
base
of
this
beer
there
are
enough
imperial
coffee
stouts
it
nice
to
have
one
that
is
a
little
lighter
with
better
drinkability
this
beer
has
really
good
drinkability
some
of
those
coffee
stouts
are
so
rich
and
robust
that
you
really
cant
have
more
then
one
but
with
this
beer
i
feel
like
i
could
have
two
or
three
without
being
overwhelmed
by
the
flavor
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
and
the
look
this
beer
looked
damn
good
and
the
flavor
had
just
enough
roast
and
coffee
flavor
to
it
the
only
thing
i
would
change
would
be
to
make
it
just
a
little
thicker
but
other
then
that
it
is
pretty
spot
on
i
will
for
sure
be
getting
the
holiday
pack
again
with
beers
like
this
chocolate
bock
and
holiday
porter
make
this
the
most
solid
holiday
pack
around
i
only
wish
that
they
would
put
this
in
six
packs
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
that
is
a
fan
of
coffee
flavors
in
their
beer
this
beer
should
do
the
trick
i
really
like
this
beer
i
like
to
refer
to
this
beer
as
breakfast
stout
light
the
flavors
are
pretty
similar
ir
is
just
in
a
lighter
and
more
drinkable
beer
this
is
one
solid
coffee
stout
and
this
beer
fits
in
nicely
in
their
holiday
pack
good
job
sam
adams
i
going
to
miss
this
beer
when
the
season
is
over
o
its
ok
but
i
expect
more
out
of
coffee
stouts
especially
one
made
by
a
brewery
i
usually
like
so
much
o
not
a
bad
addition
to
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
but
im
not
sure
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
it
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
aroma
is
of
coffee
toasted
malt
dark
fruit
and
hints
of
caramel
the
body
is
medium
and
creamy
flavors
are
toasted
roasted
malt
coffee
and
dark
fruit
the
finish
is
medium
bittersweet
on
a
light
side
but
tasty
easy
drinking
brew
pours
black
in
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
leaves
great
lacing
aroma
of
chocolate
malts
and
coffee
taste
follows
the
nose
but
the
coffee
is
off
tastes
like
cheap
coffee
follows
with
sweet
chocolate
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
thin
but
that
makes
it
easier
to
drink
not
too
bad
but
not
fantastic
o
if
you
like
sams
stouts
then
you
will
love
this
perfect
for
after
a
meal
smooth
mellow
feel
a
bit
like
a
milk
stout
dark
chocolate
roast
malt
aftertaste
light
coffee
notes
some
tobacco
leaf
and
banana
sweetness
fairly
light
bodied
but
smooth
and
flavorful
mild
coffee
bitterness
dry
finish
overall
its
pretty
good
not
especially
bold
but
plenty
of
coffee
and
mellow
roastiness
perfect
for
fall
weather
i
wasnt
expecting
to
be
impressed
and
it
may
not
be
outstanding
but
this
is
as
good
a
coffee
stout
as
you
might
ask
for
apart
from
the
very
best
if
this
came
in
fourpacks
id
buy
one
o
i
was
quite
surprised
with
this
beer
from
sam
adams
i
feel
they
did
a
very
nice
job
making
a
coffee
stout
this
is
a
very
welcomed
addition
to
the
winter
collection
the
body
is
medium
with
a
nice
creamy
feel
its
not
heavily
carbonated
but
maybe
a
hint
much
for
a
stout
a
good
effort
overall
pretty
complex
for
a
coffee
stout
with
some
unique
notes
to
it
and
not
overrun
by
the
coffee
the
texture
is
its
biggest
let
down
but
still
quite
good
d
i
enjoyed
this
coffee
stout
more
than
most
that
a
try
a
nice
surprise
overall
an
extremely
nice
coffee
stout
and
one
that
id
surely
have
again
although
i
think
itd
be
better
named
chocolate
coffee
stout
rather
than
just
coffee
stout
o
definitely
a
nice
contribution
by
the
sam
people
im
seeing
that
im
far
up
on
the
ratings
compared
to
most
others
but
im
not
comparing
this
to
other
stouts
it
seems
in
its
own
and
very
intentional
style
of
a
decent
schwarzbier
infused
with
sumatran
coffee
i
tend
to
think
its
miscategorized
as
an
american
stout
and
that
it
might
be
better
described
as
a
coffee
schwarzbier
pours
a
pretty
solid
black
with
not
much
light
entering
has
a
big
tan
soapy
head
that
laces
the
glass
the
nose
is
dominated
by
roasted
malts
and
coffee
the
taste
follows
with
coffee
and
toasted
malts
burnt
brown
sugar
and
caramel
has
a
pretty
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
its
a
good
beer
that
i
could
easily
drink
more
of
o
this
along
with
the
rauchbier
from
the
harvest
pack
are
fantastic
beers
sa
really
hit
the
mark
here
would
like
a
bit
more
coffee
but
i
am
a
coffee
lover
so
theres
never
too
much
coffee
in
anything
quite
surprised
that
this
is
a
sa
beer
wish
it
were
available
in
a
6
pack
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
stout
if
you
like
coffee
andor
are
just
getting
into
stouts
this
would
be
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
sam
adams
makes
solid
beers
for
the
most
part
and
this
one
is
no
different
o
this
is
a
really
good
coffee
stout
not
up
there
with
peche
mortel
but
the
balance
is
fantastic
and
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
a
great
addition
to
the
winter
mix
pack
o
a
nicely
balanced
stout
very
easy
drinking
with
a
good
amount
of
coffee
flavors
including
some
rich
espresso
theres
also
some
subtle
chocolate
aromas
and
a
good
deal
of
roastiness
excellent
for
a
lower
abv
stout
im
very
surprised
with
this
sam
adams
offering
this
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
brown
hues
around
the
edges
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
solid
quarter
inch
cap
of
light
tan
foam
the
aroma
is
of
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
has
more
roasted
malt
and
less
coffee
and
chocolate
than
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
coffee
stout
that
i
would
certainly
drink
again
dark
brown
and
nearly
opaque
with
faint
reddish
highlights
a
short
brown
cap
of
fine
bubbles
appeared
during
the
pour
lingered
for
quite
some
time
and
left
some
sticky
streaky
lacing
on
the
glass
roasty
aroma
coffee
malted
milk
mild
molasses
caramel
and
chocolate
moderate
bitterness
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
sweetness
roast
nutty
coffee
grounds
caramel
and
chocolate
notes
were
very
faint
compared
to
the
aroma
slight
cherry
or
currant
flavour
in
the
finish
decent
texture
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
mild
astringency
from
the
dark
grains
overall
a
solid
and
drinkable
coffee
stout
overall
i
would
get
a
sixer
of
this
very
tasty
it
was
one
of
the
main
reason
for
getting
the
winter
12pk
and
im
happy
i
got
to
try
it
o
hmm
i
like
it
but
its
kinda
sorta
an
intro
to
the
stout
style
brew
to
me
i
really
like
the
flavor
profile
but
i
would
have
liked
more
of
a
roasted
character
especially
on
the
finish
when
it
just
sorta
goes
flat
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
definitely
worth
a
try
though

someone

better
wont
mind
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
again
i
like
that
sam
adams
is
moving
into
other
styles
to
round
out
its
selections
id
like
black
and
brew
to
be
a
bit
bolder
and
the
mouthfeel
to
be
livelier
worthy
and
part
of
a
terrific
sampler
pack
i
am
impressed
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
seasonal
offerings
from
this
pack
o
theres
an
artificiality
in
the
flavors
its
a
coffee
stout
and
as
such
hits
the
mark
otherwiseits
uneventful
fun
to
drink
but
a
kitsch
marketing
ploy
not
fit
for
competiting
with
the
finest
stouts
its
flavorful
enough
to
exceed
most
beers
but
i
just
cant
get
into
it
overall
not
my
favorite
coffee
beer
not
very
complex
the
coffee
is
overpowering
and
very
astringent
the
chocolate
is
very
subdued
tastes
like
cold
diner
coffee
in
a
bottle
not
something
id
search
out
but
certainly
good
enough
to
drink
as
part
of
the
winter
classics

was

this
is
a
great
addition
to
the
holiday
sampler
good
riddance
cranberry
lambic
make
way
for
black
brew
terrible
name
but
good
beer
o
solid
offering
from
sam
adams
not
bad
at
all
though
i
expected
a
fresh
coffee
flavor
rather
than
a
cooked
used
grounds
character
there
is
a
lingering
bite
that
the
palate
just
cant
shake
one
bottle
is
enough
and
i
am
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
offering
it
started
off
enjoyable
and
started
to
fall
apart
but
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
when
it
got
warmer
i
started
to
enjoy
it
more
this
is
worth
checking
out
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
for
nearly
6
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
pop
with
this
one
and
it
just
sort
of
fell
short
when
i
first
heard
this
was
going
to
be
a
part
of
the
collection
i
was
excited
to
get
to
try
it
and
i
feel
a
little
let
down
by
this
im
not
ripping
the
beer
but
i
just
feel
like
it
could
have
been
a
lot
better
overall
its
a
very
nice
coffee
beer
especially
for
a
mass
produced
and
widely
spread
beer
it
really
isnt
quite
a
stout
though
imo
it
should
be
called
a
coffee
porter
due
to
how
thin
it
is
but
its
a
great
addition
to
the
best
mixed
seasonal
pack
on
the
market
o
pretty
damn
good
but
im
a
sucker
for
coffee
stouts
i
really
wish
sam
adams
would
sell
this
in
6
packs
so
i
could
drink
it
all
the
time
o
great
drinkable
american
stout
my
favorite
in
the
winter
pack
really
happy
to
see
it
new
this
year
this
is
some
good
stuff
i
am
really
impressed
lots
of
flavor
well
blended
and
highly
drinkable
well
done
overall
the
only
drawback
i
can
come
up
with
is
the
misplaced
slightly
cloying
sweetness
the
java
notes
are
not
heavy
handed
which
could
be
perceived
as
a
plus
i
would
definitley
buy
this
by
the
six
or
twelve
pack
if
it
were
available
highly
recommended
poured
this
into
my
duvel
tulip
nice
head
retention
and
a
nice
coffee
stout
smell
to
it
taste
was
nice
not
a
ris
by
any
means
just
a
nice
lite
coffee
stout
the
espresso
really
came
through
to
me
my
real
only
gripe
with
this
one
was
that
it
just
felt
very
thin
on
the
pallete
it
needed
some
more
body
on
it
i
believe
this
is
the
first
year
for
this
one
so
all
in
all
a
nice
coffee
brew
to
enjoy
after
work
while
the
temp
is
starting
to
dip
a
bit
easily
this
is
one
of
the
better
coffee
stouts
i
have
ever
had
its
not
the
easiest
style
to
work
with
oftentimes
oftentimes
coffee
and
malt
flavors
can
become
disjointed
and
awkward
this
isnt
the
case
with
the
black
and
brew
the
appearance
is
a
nice
black
with
pleasant
but
fleeting
tan
head
it
smells
like
coffee
but
not
just
coffee
but
with
added
cream
and
perhaps
a
little
chocolate
too
its
creamy
which
is
great
its
got
a
good
sticky
mouthfeel
that
lingers
for
quite
a
while
the
taste
does
too
overall
id
say
this
would
be
the
celebrated
beer
out
of
the
sam
adams
winter
assortment
but
thats
just
me
cheers
mouthfeeloverall
lightmedium
bodied
with
moderate
fine
carbonation
pretty
smooth
drinking
but
would
be
nice
if
it
had
a
bit
more
body
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
coffee
stout
its
no
fbs
or
central
waters
coffee
stout
in
terms
of
quality
but
nice
would
love
to
be
able
to
pick
this
up
year
round
perfect
for
cold
winter
nights
o
a
nice
american
stout
with
the
added
complexity
and
allure
of
sumatra
coffee
at
5
8
abv
black
brew
is
poised
as
a
nice
replacement
for
your
after
dinner
coffee
or
morning
accompaniment
for
the
more
brazen
id
really
like
to
see
this
stout
added
to
sams
lineup
as
a
sixer
next
winter
this
is
an
excellent
beer
its
like
if
they
added
coffee
to
their
already
delicious
cream
stout
samuel
adams
is
expert
at
mixing
their
malts
for
a
delicious
sweet
full
bodied
beer
their
stouts
and
darker
beers
are
always
excellent
as
well
this
one
being
no
exception
this
is
actually
my
first
coffee
beer
and
while
i
know
theres
probably
stronger
tasting
ones
out
there
this
one
is
really
a
perfect
combination
of
coffee
and
beer
not
too
much
coffee
where
its
weird
to
drink
but
not
too
little
where
you
dont
taste
it
excellent
offering
from
samuel
adams
gotta
admit
i
was
pretty
excited
to
try
this
when
i
heard
of
its
inclusion
in
this
years
winter
variety
pack
it
pours
a
browntinged
obsidian
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
mild
chocolate
and
a
subtle
twinge
of
coffee
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
stronger
coffee
contingent
one
that
comes
across
nice
and
smooth
rather
than
overly
bitter
or
roasted
too
darkly
very
nice
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
surprisingly
very
tasty
and
easygoing
coffee
stout
nuff
said
get
some
this
is
a
real
nice
effort
by
boston
beer
its
a
lighter
but
very
drinkable
stout
with
an
unusual
mix
of
flavor
notes
not
sure
if
they
need
to
tinker
with
that
winter
sampler
much
more
overall
i
liked
it
and
am
glad
i
have
one
more
but
consider
me
spoiled
since
i
would
rather
have
a
breakfast
stout
nice
beer
overall
overall
a
betterthanaverage
outing
by
sam
adams
a
great
addition
to
the
already
great
winter
mixed
pack
o
got
it
in
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
good
buy
great
selection
in
the
pack
this
is
a
good
stout
but
for
a
coffee
infused
stout
its
just
decent
this
beer
is
nothing
like
any
beer
i
have
had
before
especially
at
the
affordability
of
a
sam
adams
variety
pack
which
can
often
be
found
on
sale
at
a
total
wine
or
local
grocery
store
sam
adams
may
have
taken
a
while
to
put
out
a
coffee
beer
but
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
especially
if
you
like
coffee
beers
they
did
a
great
job
of
getting
the
coffee
flavor
in
the
beer
which
i
have
had
trouble
finding
previously
though
i
think
this
is
two
in
a
row
that
i
have
liked
o
i
have
to
say
out
of
all
the
samuel
adams
brews
ive
had
throughout
the
years
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
this
takes
the
exceptional
cream
stout
taste
and
adds
a
certain
edge
to
it
thats
the
only
way
i
can
explain
it
a
pretty
darn
good
coffee
stout
i
usually
lean
towards
stout
that
lean
to
the
chocolate
side
of
things
but
this
beer
is
quite
well
done
and
id
have
no
problem
drinking
these
all
winter
talk
about
being
taken
by
surprise
and
having
a
really
well
made
coffee
stout
by
sam
adams
its
beers
like
this
that
rejuvenate
my
appreciation
for
the
boston
beer
company
and
remind
me
they
still
brew
their
beers
as
a
craft
not
all
are
winners
but
when
they
have
the
portfolio
to
brew
essentially
every
style
thats
amazing
while
tasting
great
too
even
though
id
rather
drink
a
different
kind
of
stout
i
can
appreciate
this
beer
it
certainly
wont
prevent
me
from
buying
another
variety
pack
in
my
attempt
to
procure
more
of
the
holiday
porter
and
old
fezziwig
mouthfeel
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
mediumbody
feel
overall
black
and
brew
is
an
impressive
addition
to
the
sam
adams
lineup
seems
to
get
the
coffee
vs
stout
balance
just
right
i
like
this
coffee
stout
easily
one
of
my
favorites
from
samuel
adams
i
want
a
12
pack
because
id
replace
my
morning
coffee
with
this
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
am
a
fan
of
coffee
stouts
and
while
the
mouthfeel
might
be
a
tad
bit
thin
here
the
abv
is
lower
than
most
other
coffee
stouts
so
its
to
be
expected
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
a
lot
of
these
this
winter
12oz
bottle
purchased
as
part
of
this
years
newlyreleased
winter
mixedpack
pours
a
virtually
opaque
black
body
with
nearly
an
inch
of
khakicolored
head
roasty
espresso
dominates
the
aroma
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
espresso
blasts
the
palate
with
dark
chocolate
caramel
just
the
slightest
hint
of
date
medium
to
full
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
a
solid
coffee
stout
nothing
more
nothing
less
wow
not
bad
at
all
samuel
adams
definitely
a
holiday
feel
to
this
brew
too
o
a
very
nice
beer
it
becomes
more
appreciable
as
it
warms
and
you
get
near
the
bottom
of
the
glass
well
done
this
is
a
solid
easy
drinking
delicious
stout
nicely
done
sa
very
nice
robust
caramel
smell
mixed
with
aromas
of
coffee
and
hints
of
roasted
nuts
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
overall
not
bad
first
impression
was
really
just
the
perfect
carbonation
great
frothy
and
fluffy
mouthfeel
and
just
all
around
benefit
to
the
palate
lots
of
caramel
flavors
and
again
a
bit
of
a
smoked
hint
at
the
bac
it
has
an
average
head
size
coming
in
at
about
2
inches
and
had
a
33
5
degree
temperature
in
the
bottle
the
head
is
foamy
and
medium
brown
and
has
excellent
lacing
the
body
is
even
darker
than
the
vanilla
stout
i
had
a
couple
days
ago
i
put
it
up
to
the
light
i
couldnt
see
through
it
at
all
it
has
a
coffee
aroma
and
a
coffee
taste
with
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
it
has
a
moderate
flavor
and
an
average
finish
length
that
hits
the
middle
of
the
tongue
coffee
flavor
is
much
more
intense
than
the
nose
a
good
dark
roast
a
mild
astringency
comes
off
as
a
quenching
acidity
the
body
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
but
a
tad
thin
the
body
and
the
5
8
abv
make
this
a
very
in
my
book
anyway
sessionable
beer
something
you
dont
often
see
in
a
good
coffee
stout
a
pity
theres
only
two
per
case
overall
this
beer
is
the
entire
reason
i
choce
to
buy
the
holiday
pack
i
hope
they
telease
it
sometime
in
a
six
pack
this
beer
is
great
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
from
bbc
smooth
bold
and
delicious
nothing
complex
here
but
super
nice
balance
of
roasted
sweet
and
bitterness
levels
very
nice
pours
an
expected
black
color
with
a
large
pillowy
mocha
cream
head
aroma
of
fresh
ground
coffee
beans
and
a
touch
of
confectioners
chocolate
in
the
taste
a
well
balanced
mix
of
espresso
roasted
malts
cocoa
and
milk
chocolate
even
balance
with
a
nice
bitterness
from
hop
and
coffee
drying
and
roasty
with
notes
of
malted
milk
balls
and
chocolate
covered
coffee
bean
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
quite
smooth
with
adequate
carbonation
overall
though
a
little
late
to
the
party
boston
beer
co
has
brewed
a
fine
coffee
beer
very
nice
o
i
bought
the
24
pack
just
to
try
this
beer
i
couldnt
wait
to
try
it
and
it
didnt
disappoint
i
just
cant
get
over
the
smell
its
just
so
good
pours
a
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
burnt
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
little
to
no
lacing
is
left
on
the
class
has
a
sweet
hoplike
chocolaty
aroma
mouth
feel
is
smooth
tastes
sweet
at
the
beginning
with
a
sour
aftertaste
the
coffee
is
a
little
hard
to
detect
until
the
very
end
great
tasting
beer
to
try
once
or
twice
poured
dark
brown
with
short
deep
tan
head
head
does
not
last
very
little
lacing
of
the
glass
aroma
is
chocolaty
taste
is
a
bit
too
sweet
the
coffee
flavour
overpowers
any
other
ingredient
luckily
its
a
decent
coffee
in
the
beer
a
bit
sour
in
the
aftertaste
worth
trying
once
coffee
beers
arent
really
my
cup
of
tea
but
this
one
isnt
too
bad
wouldnt
buy
it
if
it
wasnt
in
the
winter
variety
pack
though
o
nice
surprise
in
the
winter
sa
12
pack
this
is
a
drinkable
and
well
balanced
coffee
stout
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
packaged
by
itself
as
6
packs
or
12
packs
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
large
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
heavy
on
the
coffee
with
some
chocolate
mixed
in
the
coffee
smells
like
straight
black
coffee
with
no
sissy
sugar
or
cream
added
the
flavor
is
also
very
heavy
on
the
coffee
there
are
also
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
notes
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
cream
the
beer
is
a
little
thinner
in
body
than
i
expected
and
the
carbonation
is
medium
to
high
a
very
nice
coffee
stout
and
one
that
i
hope
goes
into
regular
production
odoverall
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
beers
i
have
had
way
better
than
expected
really
hits
the
coffee
flavor
well
this
needs
to
be
at
very
least
a
seasonal
six
pack
i
really
liked
it
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
pours
an
amazing
beautiful
black
with
a
two
and
a
half
inch
sticky
mocha
head
lots
of
lacing
very
impressed
with
the
retention
smell
is
expresso
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
all
of
that
with
coffee
chocolate
to
start
with
some
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
smoke
and
vanilla
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
great
especially
considerin
the
reasonable
abv
heavy
for
its
size
with
plenty
of
carbonation
a
great
addition
to
the
winter
mix
pack
might
be
the
stand
out
now
nothing
i
dont
want
to
drink
in
this
12
any
more
nice
work
o
definitely
a
winner
in
the
line
up
of
samuel
adams
seasonal
12
pack
i
thought
that
this
was
a
remarkably
well
blended
coffee
stout
that
plain
and
simple
got
it
right
not
frills
attached
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
this
were
it
available
this
pours
a
solid
flat
black
with
a
generous
topping
of
tan
foam
theres
a
sharp
delicious
aroma
of
dark
chocolates
and
darkroasted
coffee
that
comes
through
the
coffee
definitely
dominates
the
flavor
its
as
if
i
dumped
my
favorite
french
roast
into
a
stout
recipe
stout
or
porter
im
not
going
to
enter
that
debate
right
now
this
is
smartly
balanced
with
a
lingering
coffee
finish
that
coats
the
palate
all
around
solid
brew
mohas
a
real
nice
body
impressive
lacing
down
side
of
this
beer
is
your
taste
buds
get
fatigue
rather
quickly
one
is
good
enough
for
me
in
one
setting
after
that
im
looking
for
somthing
else
somthing
new
is
always
nice
i
know
alot
of
us
buy
the
mix
pack
for
the
old
fezzy
wig
alone
nothing
wrong
with
that
though
anyways
its
a
good
beer
not
great
now
if
i
can
just
keep
my
wife
from
finding
the
other
bottle
o
pretty
damned
good
beer
and
i
must
say
i
am
surprised
i
think
this
is
a
fine
coffee
stout
nice
addition
to
the
winter
pack
o
a
definite
winner
from
bbc
fits
the
season
perfectly
and
isnt
so
extreme
that
it
will
push
noncraft
drinkers
away
havent
particularly
enjoyed
some
of
their
new
seasonal
beers
their
saison
and
kolsch
in
the
summer
pack
tasted
too
similar
and
were
just
decent
overall
but
this
one
is
a
nice
exception
2011
sam
adams
holiday
samplers
offers
up
this
new
brew
from
jim
koch
and
company
appears
pitch
black
no
light
makes
it
through
when
held
toward
the
light
deep
thick
mocha
tan
head
forms
a
dense
foam
cap
with
speckled
even
coated
lacing
left
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
is
great
pure
ice
brewed
coffe
roasts
with
creamy
sweet
lactose
sugar
notes
and
a
caramelized
malt
presence
really
makes
for
a
pleasant
smell
creamy
dark
chocolateroasted
coffee
accents
works
wonderfully
together
semi
acidic
nautre
about
it
from
the
coffee
roasts
robust
coffee
flavor
in
each
sip
really
a
well
rounded
sipping
stout
easy
to
drink
but
intense
with
layers
of
flavor
caramelized
creamy
malt
sugars
and
robust
sumatran
coffee
even
has
layers
of
vine
ripened
fruitiness
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fuller
bodied
never
thick
or
hard
to
bear
on
the
palate
quite
the
oppposite
with
velvet
texture
and
smooth
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
source
of
mainstream
coffee
beer
the
way
it
should
be
brewed
every
time
one
that
highlights
the
nature
of
how
awesome
both
coffee
and
beer
can
be
especially
as
in
the
symbiotic
relationship
that
black
and
brew
provides
just
try
this
one
this
holiday
season
a
nice
stout
not
big
but
it
is
flavorful
a
good
keeper
for
sam
adams
a
new
winner
from
sam
adams
this
was
smooth
tasty
and
very
enjoyable
this
brew
hid
the
5
8
abv
very
well
and
at
first
it
seemed
like
a
gimmick
beer
until
i
got
the
cap
off
and
then
inhaled
that
wonderful
coffee
aroma
this
beer
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
and
a
beer
i
definitely
recommend
checking
out
overall
a
great
beer
for
a
cool
day
solid
all
the
way
around
ive
been
increasingly
impressed
with
what
bbc
is
doing
with
what
is
pretty
much
massproduced
beer
i
was
highly
impressed
by
this
beer
especially
after
having
there
chocolate
bock
which
was
terrible
in
my
opinion
this
beer
had
a
very
creamy
head
along
with
a
very
creamy
taste
the
roasted
malt
characteristics
were
on
point
as
well
as
the
smooth
finish
it
could
have
had
a
little
more
hop
tastecoming
from
someone
who
isnt
high
on
hops
but
overall
i
still
give
this
beer
an
8
5
out
of
10
o
i
really
like
this
new
offering
most
coffee
stouts
i
have
had
are
higher
abv
beers
this
is
perfect
balance
is
the
key
nothing
overpowers
and
this
is
highly
drinkable
a
great
alternative
to
the
imperial
stouts
with
coffee
a
great
beer
imho
ill
certainly
stock
up
on
this
if
it
goes
to
sixers
overall
i
must
say
i
bought
the
12
pack
winter
variety
just
to
try
this
beer
and
i
am
really
glad
i
did
i
was
really
kind
of
surprised
at
the
quality
of
this
one
very
coffee
forward
but
does
not
dismiss
the
great
qualities
of
a
stout
chocolates
and
roasted
malts
very
nice
i
am
impressed
oim
fairly
impressed
with
this
stout
its
one
of
the
most
full
flavored
american
stouts
that
ive
had
it
shows
how
good
and
fairly
intense
flavor
can
come
from
a
lower
abv
it
does
seems
to
lose
some
of
its
luster
as
the
drink
goes
on
o
definitely
a
nice
wintertype
drink
theres
a
lot
more
coffee
character
than
any
stout
ive
ever
had
before
its
not
really
a
bad
thing
at
all
its
just
strange
i
guess
you
dont
how
much
it
tastes
like
coffee
unless
you
try
it
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
coffee
avoid
this
one
you
wont
like
it
otherwise
its
a
quality
albeit
interesting
stout
definitely
worth
picking
up
especially
since
it
comes
packaged
with
some
other
great
brews
mo
this
beer
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
not
too
overpowering
and
not
too
sweet
overall
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
drinkable
normally
beers
like
this
are
a
bit
to
bitter
for
my
taste
but
this
one
gives
me
a
bit
of
sweet
combined
with
a
nice
coffee
flavor
minus
the
bitterness
definitely
worth
checking
out
overall
it
was
a
little
underwhelming
decent
option
for
its
low
price
tag
for
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
beer
seems
like
a
lot
of
them
are
ten
times
more
expensive
these
days
but
the
more
expensive
ones
are
indeed
better
so
getting
what
you
pay
for
very
good
bourbon
barrel
stout
not
too
heavy
o
despite
the
poor
mouthfeel
this
beer
looks
and
smells
great
and
is
tasty
enough
just
for
kicks
i
added
a
small
pour
of
bourbon
to
the
second
half
of
the
glass
and
it
made
it
quite
nice
bourbon
barrel
stout
is
a
great
tasting
beer
i
prefer
the
beer
taste
from
the
tap
instead
of
bottled
when
you
open
the
bottle
you
smell
bourbon
you
can
taste
the
bourbon
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
you
should
try
this
beer
on
tap
at
fords
fish
shack
in
south
riding
and
served
in
a
small
snifter
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
thats
nearly
opaque
but
shows
some
cola
highlights
when
held
to
the
lamp
minimal
head
once
it
got
to
the
table
which
settled
to
a
sheen
clearly
a
barrel
aged
beer
from
the
aroma
which
is
deep
with
vanilla
and
oak
there
are
roasted
malt
molasses
and
char
notes
as
well
taste
is
not
exciting
and
leads
off
watery
it
is
moderately
sweet
with
vanilla
molasses
and
a
dusting
of
cocoa
it
is
also
moderately
bitter
on
the
finish
with
espresso
oak
char
and
roasted
malt
flavors
a
weak
medium
body
thin
texture
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sweet
woody
finish
i
poured
it
in
the
sink
after
three
sips
being
from
louisville
it
makes
me
sad
to
say
that
bbc
just
does
not
come
through
on
anything
poor
execution
this
was
very
nice
and
balanced
bit
of
bourbon
bit
of
chocolate
unfortunately
i
sampled
it
after
extremely
angry
beast
if
you
like
subdued
barrel
aging
like
i
normally
do
this
might
just
be
for
you
more
of
a
gentle
pinch
than
a
bone
crunching
hay
maker
glass
snifter
o
a
decent
entry
level
bba
stout
nothing
special
best
bourbon
stout
by
far
you
can
really
taste
the
bourbon
taste
is
a
little
light
in
the
loafers
so
to
speak
the
malts
need
some
beef
the
barrel
character
is
pretty
nice
and
the
roast
well
integrated
it
just
seems
to
lack
body
and
sweetness
that
would
go
a
long
way
here
certainly
thin
is
a
good
descriptor
the
aroma
was
good
here
but
the
taste
leaves
me
wanting
a
better
beer
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
give
this
one
another
go
o
nothing
special
here
maybe
it
would
be
good
if
it
was
the
first
ba
stout
ever
tasted
o
a
decent
enough
bbs
but
not
particularly
complex
very
mild
this
might
be
the
bbs
to
serve
your
friends
that
have
never
had
one
o
decent
mild
in
all
sense
for
this
style
light
on
the
flavors
and
complexity
had
this
while
waiting
entirely
too
long
for
my
takeout
thai
food
to
be
ready
second
offering
from
these
guys
nice
brownishblack
color
relatively
mild
bourbon
flavor
couldve
used
a
little
more
some
slight
pecan
notes
in
there
as
well
faint
aromas
considering
the
genre
expected
stronger
not
as
smooth
of
a
mouthfeel
as
youd
expect
either
decent
maybe
a
little
underrated
on
here
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
this
if
you
want
a
good
bourbon
stout
id
suggest
alltechs
brewing
their
brewery
is
shared
with
town
branch
bourbon
distillery
so
the
barrels
they
use
are
fresh
literally
the
barrel
empties
5
year
old
bourbon
and
hours
later
is
filled
with
a
batch
of
beer
to
age
they
have
perfected
the
art
of
bourbon
barrel
aging
for
beer
o
was
really
hoping
for
a
more
robustness
really
missed
the
bourbon
solid
pssffft
upon
prying
the
tap
and
the
oversized
bubbly
head
both
suggest
an
overcarbonated
stout
given
the
appearance
the
aroma
suggests
this
could
be
an
infected
bottle
it
smels
dank
and
sour
there
is
a
hint
of
bourbon
and
maybe
the
dank
is
just
from
the
oak
barrel
sips
definitely
overcarbonated
flavor
features
spoiled
dark
grains
its
drinkable
barely
at
best
a
few
more
sips
actually
i
think
id
rather
pour
this
out
and
have
a
good
beer
o
this
was
a
disappointment
the
carbonation
was
way
too
much
it
blew
out
the
rest
of
my
sences
in
the
taste
no
hints
of
oak
or
a
barrel
at
all
overall
i
was
a
bit
sad
with
my
experience
of
my
first
barrel
aged
stout
i
feel
that
the
bourbon
was
overdone
without
the
flavors
of
the
beer
remaining
in
the
taste
profile
o
its
a
decent
barrel
aged
stout
that
is
easy
to
get
in
my
area
i
would
like
just
a
little
bit
more
flavor
and
a
thicker
mouthfeel
oaverage
stout
barrelaged
adds
a
little
but
still
does
not
have
notable
flavor
and
light
body
for
a
stout
best
bourbon
barrel
stout
ive
had
its
my
go
to
when
i
feel
like
a
bourbon
barrel
stout
the
bourbon
flavor
is
not
over
the
top
like
some
new
holland
dragon
milk
for
example
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
you
can
taste
the
bourbon
but
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
stout
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
poured
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
nearly
jet
black
except
for
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
lighta
very
thin
beige
head
that
was
one
in
a
blink
atop
big
vanillabourbon
and
sweet
brown
sugar
in
the
nosesmells
very
sweet
almost
cloying
thin
and
borderline
watery
feel
just
takes
any
steam
this
beer
may
have
had
awayflavors
of
vanilla
and
brown
sugarfaint
char
but
it
doesnt
impede
the
sweetness
much
wow
this
is
a
clunkeri
was
hoping
for
something
much
better
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
goblet
black
its
a
stout
surprise
surprise
with
very
little
to
no
head
the
aroma
was
nice
but
very
subtle
like
some
other
reviews
i
wouldve
appreciated
a
stronger
hint
of
bourbon
but
it
definitely
was
not
offensive
by
any
means
the
taste
reminded
me
a
bit
of
something
oakbarrel
aged
i
e
vanilla
notes
not
sure
if
thats
the
case
or
not
it
was
a
bit
watery
for
lack
of
a
better
word
not
as
creamy
as
id
like
but
overall
pretty
solid
stout
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
in
awhile
would
definitely
drink
again
definitely
not
as
strong
as
what
i
would
like
the
bourbon
flavor
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
try
it
youll
probably
like
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
stout
with
a
touch
of
bourbon
flavor
id
say
the
flavor
was
added
instead
of
it
being
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
like
most
other
beers
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
isnt
necessarily
a
sipper
id
recommend
it
a
thick
black
pour
with
a
slight
bit
of
head
which
quickly
dissipated
smells
of
delicious
sweet
chocolate
hint
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
molasses
the
bourbon
smells
really
subtle
which
is
honestly
relieving
for
a
change
ooh
yeah
a
delicious
coffeechocolate
flavor
blast
up
front
followed
by
a
nice
mellow
vanilla
bourbon
bite
a
really
nicely
done
stout
i
honestly
cannot
for
the
life
of
me
understand
the
average
rating
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
nice
bitter
dark
chocolate
flavor
lingers
for
most
of
the
drink
and
every
gassy
burp
brings
up
hints
of
vanilla
really
loving
this
one
medium
in
bod
with
moderate
carbonation
light
for
a
heavy
bourbon
barrel
stout
but
honestly
nice
for
a
change
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
stout
mellow
on
the
bourbon
but
its
still
very
noticeable
really
like
this
one
a
lot
lacks
in
bourbon
character
good
notes
of
chocolate
but
may
be
a
little
overly
sweet
o
my
grading
is
based
on
what
it
is
a
stout
although
the
abv
may
suggest
otherwise
i
was
looking
for
more
bourbon
flavors
but
its
still
a
pretty
tasty
stout
nonetheless
low
b
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
was
expecting
something
much
bolder
in
flavor
but
i
can
see
that
the
barrel
aging
didnt
take
the
main
focus
here
my
biggest
beef
is
that
the
base
beer
the
stout
was
fairly
standard
to
begin
with
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
topnotch
stout
as
the
base
beer
this
could
have
been
great
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
liked
it
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
lots
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
and
some
nice
light
bourbon
this
is
a
good
bba
stout
that
comes
in
12
oz
bottles
and
isnt
too
heavy
or
high
abv
would
definitely
have
it
again
overall
not
bad
not
a
great
beer
but
the
base
stout
seems
like
a
pretty
good
beer
it
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
malts
and
flavors
going
on
its
not
an
imperial
stout
so
fairly
good
for
just
an
american
stout
however
the
lack
of
bourbon
barrel
really
hits
hard
as
i
really
wanted
some
of
that
a
fairly
okay
barrel
aged
stout
nothing
special
pours
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
nose
has
chocolate
coffee
vanilla
and
bourbon
the
tastes
are
balanced
with
a
nice
but
not
overwhelming
bourbon
character
at
first
and
finishes
mostly
vanilla
bourbon
the
feel
is
very
nice
and
chewy
i
would
have
this
beer
again
nice
on
a
cold
night
i
want
to
like
this
more
but
for
the
price
there
are
just
too
many
others
that
surpass
pours
dark
but
with
no
head
the
smell
is
coffee
taste
is
vanilla
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
a
little
sweet
and
some
fruit
bourbon
and
woody
barrel
taste
as
name
implies
the
alcohol
lingers
on
the
tongue
creamy
and
has
a
full
body
however
the
body
needs
more
depth
before
i
rank
it
higher
overall
a
real
missed
opportunity
here
i
think
if
the
mouthfeel
could
be
improved
this
could
really
be
a
top
notch
brew
until
then
not
really
worth
seeking
out
o
looks
good
smells
good
but
the
thin
body
and
booziness
just
seems
out
of
place
overall
id
say
this
is
pretty
good
the
chocolate
flavour
was
greatsmooth
and
creamy
overall
a
good
experience
but
a
little
pricy
for
just
good
served
from
bottle
into
a
flared
pilsner
poured
a
dark
red
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
wood
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
wood
sweet
alcohol
subtle
caramel
and
smoke
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
i
saw
this
one
on
the
menu
and
that
it
was
bourbon
barrel
aged
and
had
to
try
it
however
while
the
barrel
was
definitely
there
in
this
one
it
really
made
me
wonder
how
good
the
actual
base
beer
really
is
as
the
barrel
was
pretty
much
the
dominate
factor
on
this
one
while
being
okay
to
drink
it
did
leave
a
little
to
be
desired
worth
trying
at
least
once
if
you
can
but
i
would
leave
it
at
that
pours
black
with
an
off
white
head
that
lasts
all
the
way
down
red
around
the
edges
the
nose
matches
the
taste
there
is
a
bit
of
chocolate
a
bit
of
coffee
some
roastyness
a
bit
of
vinalla
and
of
course
a
touch
of
bourbon
the
tastes
all
seem
balanced
and
in
check
but
its
not
extremely
exciting
and
i
didnt
get
a
ton
of
the
bourbon
character
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
size
but
it
has
a
somewhat
unpleasant
soapyness
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
nothing
to
really
seek
out
by
any
means
but
if
your
into
it
not
bad
o
mild
and
buttery
not
terrible
but
certainly
not
average
for
bourbon
barrel
stout
to
be
in
the
largest
font
on
the
label
this
beer
doesnt
live
up
to
its
namesake
its
an
okay
stout
but
its
missing
the
mark
on
many
levels
this
is
an
averagetohalfdecent
american
stout
that
happens
to
be
barrelaged
although
it
didnt
pick
up
many
complexities
im
going
to
give
it
a
3
5
overall
but
mostly
for
effort
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
little
thinner
that
i
wantedexpected
for
the
style
there
is
a
nice
complexity
to
the
flavor
but
it
is
a
little
harsh
to
be
a
sessionable
beer
alcohol
could
have
been
more
well
hidden
m
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
for
a
stout
good
flow
and
a
pleasant
aftertaste
good
stuff
i
liked
it
alot
it
was
an
ok
beer
in
general
but
a
complete
miss
on
the
style
o
a
great
barrel
aged
stout
that
is
very
drinkable
hardly
a
trace
of
booziness
in
this
beer
just
some
nice
warming
really
flavorful
and
a
great
mouthfeel
i
have
not
had
a
ton
of
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
but
many
i
have
had
really
overdo
the
bourbon
but
this
beer
strikes
a
great
balance
fizzy
carbonation
is
the
first
impression
in
the
mouth
overall
this
beer
shows
some
of
the
promise
of
a
barrel
aged
double
stout
but
perhaps
also
some
of
the
difficulty
in
finding
the
right
balance
in
the
barrel
treatment
overall
extremely
disappointed
in
this
one
you
can
barely
tell
theres
bourbon
in
there
tastes
like
a
weak
brown
ale
not
even
close
to
a
stout
not
offensive
tastewise
but
offensive
to
the
style
stay
away
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
for
a
stout
overall
i
find
this
beer
to
be
too
sweet
and
thin
to
compete
in
the
bal
aged
category
decent
try
but
not
great
o
not
a
very
good
beer
unfortunately
i
found
this
to
be
pretty
good
stuff
and
better
than
the
ba
score
here
indicates
i
had
only
modest
expectations
going
in
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
not
up
to
the
level
of
the
big
barrel
aged
heavy
hitters
out
there
but
i
would
put
this
on
par
with
something
like
weyerbachers
heresy
disappointing
this
is
the
example
of
a
brewery
that
has
jumped
on
the
barrel
aged
bandwagon
this
is
a
watereddown
example
of
a
barrel
aged
stout
and
is
frankly
a
disgrace
to
carry
the
name
barrel
aged
stout
black
in
color
with
a
weakly
colored
brown
head
taste
is
weak
with
light
notes
of
chocolate
that
fade
as
quick
as
you
can
begin
to
taste
them
watery
and
light
for
a
barrel
aged
beer
mouthfeel
is
like
drinking
water
save
your
money
extreme
disappointment
feel
thin
to
medium
body
with
very
little
carbonation
this
is
neither
a
good
stout
nor
a
good
bourbonbarrel
beer
its
not
pricey
but
i
guess
i
know
why
there
is
a
hint
of
that
char
from
the
inside
of
a
barrel
that
penetrates
the
brew
i
dont
care
for
that
flavor
in
a
wine
but
it
works
well
with
a
stout
so
long
as
it
is
subtle
overall
this
actually
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
for
slapping
the
bourbon
barrel
name
on
there
this
is
not
quite
pulling
it
off
its
more
of
a
roasty
american
porterstout
to
me
but
still
enjoyable
overall
i
am
disappointed
by
this
years
offering
past
years
have
been
mush
better
and
in
fact
the
jeffersons
aged
beer
is
far
superior
to
this
beer
o
not
a
bad
beer
for
its
price
no
bad
flavors
just
falling
a
little
short
of
its
competitors
o
poor
attempt
at
a
ba
stout
missing
the
bourbon
vanilla
and
oak
flavors
and
aromas
acustomed
to
the
style
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
an
abundance
of
carbonation
that
is
effervescent
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
i
dont
want
to
be
the
one
that
screams
infection
over
this
brew
but
this
is
a
drastically
different
experience
from
the
last
bottle
i
had
the
previous
bottle
i
consumed
had
an
abundance
of
dark
cherry
tartness
and
minerals
that
was
not
enjoyable
at
all
while
this
bottle
was
slightly
better
it
still
tasted
a
bit
off
to
me
this
brew
flirts
with
having
potential
but
something
has
gone
wrong
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
when
it
is
fresh
but
i
would
be
hesitant
not
bad
overall
but
really
lacking
in
some
areas
just
kind
of
wimped
out
honestly
plus
some
offnotes
in
the
aroma
doable
i
dont
think
id
pass
up
another
one
but
not
real
memorable
o
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
definitely
not
as
good
as
others
in
the
style
o
again
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
not
awesome
either
im
pretty
sure
it
is
going
to
get
a
c
from
me
and
a
little
sweet
for
what
id
like
to
see
overall
bourbon
and
a
bit
of
bourbon
medium
carbonation
and
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
nice
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
it
was
vanilla
overload
for
me
smokey
as
producing
beers
like
this
can
very
quickly
lead
to
a
dead
end

not
a
bad
beer
alcohol
bourbon
it
is
almost
within
the
range
of
appropriateness
for
the
style
the
strong
carbonation
doesnt
help
wow
pretty
awesome
with
a
nice
bitter
coffee
flavor
from
the
onset
and
then
slowly
maturing
into
a
nice
chocolate
mild
bourbon
malts
a
good
representation
of
the
american
stout
style
though
i
have
had
others
that
i
enjoyed
more
12
oz
split
with
a
friend
who
brought
it
back
from
a
recent
trip
to
kentucky
appearance
is
decent
for
the
style
although
a
bit
heavy
on
the
fizz
but
it
goes
down
from
there
tons
of
sicky
vanilla
in
the
nose
same
in
the
taste
totally
one
dimensional
not
enough
bitterness
and
no
malt
complexity
too
much
vanilla
flavor
does
not
hide
alcohol
well
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
weak
and
not
lively
overall
this
beer
is
not
that
good
not
at
all
always
nice
to
try
something
new
though
even
if
it
sucks
poured
from
a
bottle
and
wow
so
much
popping
from
all
of
the
carbonation
way
too
much
for
the
style
imo
and
i
havent
even
tasted
it
yet
smell
is
of
weak
coffee
and
roasts
no
bourbon
taste
has
much
less
body
than
i
want
for
a
stout
theres
the
carbonation
so
much
too
much
still
no
hint
of
bourbon
i
taste
mild
malt
taste
kind
of
watered
down
with
a
mild
coffee
finish
if
you
are
curious
to
try
this
i
would
recommend
buying
a
single
bottle
before
buying
the
4
pack
if
possible
light
coca
and
some
powdery
sugar
are
in
here
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
oak
round
out
of
the
flavors
roasted
bitter
flavors
as
well
but
there
is
an
underlying
sour
note
thats
really
taking
away
from
this
over
carbonated
to
the
extreme
makes
drinking
this
undesirable
as
well
the
head
looks
nice
deep
brown
chocolate
milk
like
with
a
fairly
black
body
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
dark
tan
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
head
that
collars
around
the
glass
throughout
the
session
the
aroma
is
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
slight
bourbon
medium
mouthfeel
roasty
coffee
dark
chocolate
with
a
slight
bourbon
note
but
not
really
overly
strong
not
bad
the
body
isnt
as
heavy
as
i
would
like
for
a
beer
like
this
however
this
reminds
me
of
a
kbs
which
brought
a
grin
to
my
face
a
cheap
and
accessbile
beer
that
is
the
bourbon
is
pretty
minimal
as
well
a
pretty
easy
and
good
drinking
beer
overall
o
not
a
bad
stout
but
not
what
i
wanted
from
the
label
pours
black
with
a
small
amount
of
tan
head
smell
is
a
light
but
enjoyable
vanilla
and
roasted
malt
flavor
of
a
stout
taste
is
of
a
pretty
light
stout
the
roast
is
predominant
in
the
flavor
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
barrel
aging
from
vanilla
and
oak
not
bad
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
barrel
is
almost
comically
absent
given
the
title
of
the
beer
distinctly
average
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
with
a
sugary
finish
and
a
fairly
light
body
this
one
is
hard
to
rate
because
it
seems
to
be
barely
what
it
claims
to
be
its
not
bad
and
is
kind
of
odd
the
body
seems
to
change
as
you
make
your
way
through
it
kind
of
meek
in
the
flavor
despite
the
sugar
clinging
to
my
palette
after
each
sip
o
im
thinking
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
batch
because
there
just
wasnt
any
head
or
depth
slight
metallic
bite
as
well
probably
an
outlier
d
was
this
infected
with
brett
its
very
dry
and
low
in
sugars
and
its
definitely
overcarbonated
there
are
some
off
flavors
in
the
nose
too
the
light
texture
makes
this
easy
to
drink
even
though
its
far
from
the
best
barrelaged
stout
ive
had
o
taste
is
not
exactly
a
winner
but
the
aroma
is
a
complete
deal
breaker
12oz
bottle
pousr
near
black
with
khaki
head
and
small
carbonation
bubbles
aroma
has
oak
chocolate
coffee
but
im
not
getting
much
in
the
way
of
bourbon
hmmm
brewed
in
kentucky
but
not
much
bourbon
now
it
smells
fine
but
it
just
doesnt
smell
like
a
bourbon
barreled
stout
taste
is
roasty
bitterness
that
is
balanced
by
some
sweetness
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
slick
texture
dry
finish
this
is
actually
a
very
nice
beer
but
i
just
dont
get
any
bourbon
that
its
from
kentucky
is
what
makes
me
shake
my
head
overall
this
was
a
good
attempt
at
a
barrel
aged
stout
this
beer
is
taken
to
much
barrelling
and
not
enough
time
being
a
stout
less
carbonation
and
heavier
body
overall
skip
this
one
the
flavors
arent
off
per
se
there
just
isnt
enough
of
it
the
mouthfeel
just
really
kills
this
beer
though
o
all
in
all
this
one
is
slightly
strange
in
the
taste
but
not
unbearable
just
kind
of
taste
like
milk
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
syrup
good
to
try
if
you
want
a
milk
chocolate
stout
i
liked
the
bottle
i
had
and
would
buy
again
drinkability
well
this
beer
looked
really
good
in
the
glass
i
loved
the
smokey
aspects
although
i
was
expecting
and
hoping
for
a
bit
more
of
the
bourbon
aroma
and
flavoring
oh
well
it
was
still
rather
enjoyable
and
an
easy
drink
went
down
very
easy
considering
the
high
abv
not
horrible
but
kind
of
misleading
i
would
have
another
though
maybe
two
i
thought
this
would
be
a
sipper
and
vanilla
notes
this
beer
is
somewhat
over
carbonated
for
this
style
and
leaves
a
weird
fizzy
feel
on
the
palate
overall
as
the
aromas
that
came
out
were
rather
pleasant
there
is
a
great
deal
of
vanilla
on
the
nose
with
oak
portions
hints
of
coffee
waft
into
the
aroma
as
well
but

just

makes
this
end
with
a
peaceful
atmosphere
overall
i
first
drank
this
years
ago
from
a
holiday
sampler
but
in
seeking
its
standalone
i
find
it
a
worthy
first
beer
after
a
long
lenten
journey
an
allaround
balanced
stout
with
enough
nuance
to
stand
out
the
flavor
is
a
letdown
after
the
smell
it
has
some
interesting
notes
but
its
kind
of
flavorless
overall
the
peaty
smoke
works
well
but
the
vanilla
is
very
faint
not
much
else
here
just
a
little
chocolate
milk
the
body
is
pretty
watery
the
flavor
has
a
very
nice
vanilla
bean
component
with
a
very
faint
oak
barrel
component
and
a
moderate
level
of
dark
roasted
malts
the
vanilla
is
more
obvious
in
the
nose
and
but
builds
in
the
flavor
with
repeated
sipping
eventually
becoming
a
tiny
bit
too
strong
lightly
sweet
sweetbitter
balance
will
drink
this
one
again
i
am
sure
this
is
about
as
perfect
as
it
gets
as
winter
comes
to
a
close
i
usually
do
not
drink
stout
but
this
one
i
like
the
hint
of
vanilla
very
drinkable
pours
an
almost
clear
intense
brown
so
deep
as
to
appear
black
expressing
a
ruby
tint
when
held
to
the
light
more
when
i
find
out
the

produces
almost
3

had

slightly

afterwards
overall
i
really
liked
this
stout
love
the
massive
malt
presence
blended
beautifully
with
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
im
certainly
getting
some
more
of
this
o
an
easy
drinking
american
stout
initially
surprised
by
how
light
the
body
was
by
the
end
i
found
it
rather
enjoyable
good
flavor
profile
no
need
for
food
to
accompany
this
beer
simply
delicious
had
it
at
the
airport
waiting
in
d
c
overall
a
very
good
stout
and
better
than
i
was
expecting
recommended
lots
of
vanilla
on
this
stout
its
a
great
morning
beer
not
too
dark
on
the
roasted
malt
not
too
thick
just
right
short
lived
tan
head
just
a
quarter
inch
tall
the
nose
presents
smoked
malt
in
small
proportion
and
quite
a
bit
more
hops
than
is
common
in
the
style
vanilla
is
the
predominant
flavor
but
the
malt
complexity
is
awesome
and
layered
oak
presence
is
light
and
sweet
im
guessing
a
pretty
quick
aging
process
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
and
for
the
richness
of
flavors
it
seems
watered
down
to
me
but
the
flavors
are
awesome
my
first
beer
from
old
dominion
is
a
hit
o
solid
and
worth
a
try
but
could
be
a
bit
fuller
there
are
a
lot
of
really
good
stouts
out
there
this
isnt
one
of
them
the
flavor
of
malt
is
dominant
with
a
yeast
flavor
trailing
at
first
with
noticeable
vanilla
and
some
sweetness
with
a
mild
caramel
malt
flavor
and
subtle
roasted
barley
core
with
more
vanilla
adding
to
the
base
with
yeast
adding
to
the
complexity
as
it
warms
there
is
perhaps
a
little
raisin
and
light
spice
in
the
finish
with
low
alcohol
flavor
overall
this
is
a
very
good
stout
pretty
well
integrated
vanilla
makes
me
think
it
is
used
to
augment
the
oak
barrel
as
the
name
implies
but
smooth
flavor
and
easy
to
quaff
at
the
6
strength
overall
drinkability
overall
its
missing
some
things
that
i
would
expect
from
a
stout
smell
is
mild
and
the
mouthfeel
is
weak
and
yet
its
got
a
quite
good
flavor
profile
and
appearance
so
overall
very
good
in
some
aspects
and
weak
in
others
making
it
an
above
average
stout
in
my
opinion
not
sure
i
would
want
another
one
in
an
evening
but
i
think
with
food
like
steak
or
even
dessert
a
second
glass
would
be
welcoming
fairly
complex
beer
with
a
nice
tart
and
char
balance
its
not
overly
roasted
and
the
toasted
oak
complements
well
o
all
in
all
a
very
good
stout
that
id
recommend
in
high
hopes
for
this
beer
died
as
soon
as
i
poured
it
the
head
was
almost
nonexistent
had
almost
no
aroma
and
tasted
very
gland
in
general
got
better
as
it
warmed
up
but
not
at
all
the
beer
that
it
surely
would
like
to
be
i
didnt
detect
even
the
slightest
hint
of
the
vanilla
beans
that
were
mentioned
and
that
was
possibly
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
description
od
fairly
drinkable
not
sure
where
the
smoke
or
barrel
are
but
it
wasnt
too
bad
scored
lower
because
it
lacks
what
it
advertises
overall
like
i
said
before
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
its
always
easy
to
find
here
in
virginia
so
i
pick
it
up
pretty
often
o
this
is
a
classic
beer
to
me
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
and
i
still
enjoy
it
to
this
day
the
oak
presence
is
really
nice
and
not
dominating
very
earthy
in
flavor
but
overall
an
outstanding
beer
i
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
im
not
much
of
a
stout
drinker
but
this
one
was
tasty
super
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
there
is
a
wonderful
oakiness
which
i
know
was
intended
and
just
a
slight
hint
of
vanilla
over
the
roasted
malt
body
i
am
impressed
this
beer
may
have
just
opened
a
new
door
for
me
f
densely
packed
flavor
as
in
a
ris
without
the
abv
perfect
everyday
slightly
sweet
stout
with
good
balancing
hops
bitter
and
smokey
finish
must
try
appearence
is
decent
smell
is
lacking
it
kills
me
that
they
can
claim
oak
barrel
stout
when
it
is
just
aged
on
oak
chips
not
in
actual
barrels
taste
follows
the
nose
almost
like
a
weak
stout
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
this
seems
way
overrated
o
definitely
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
had
lots
of
rich
complex
flavors
with
smooth
drinking
qualities
a
definite
recommendation
what
a
truly
excellent
beer
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
foamy
12
tan
head
i
cant
recall
ever
having
a
beer
that
leaves
as
much
lacing
along
the
glass
as
this
one
the
smell
is
strong
with
vanilla
beans
chocolate
malt
roasted
barley
excellent
the
predominant
aspect
of
the
taste
is
definitely
the
vanilla
beans
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
makes
this
very
easy
to
drink
had
this
with
some
hamburger
sliders
w
onions
and
pickles
and
it
was
a
great
match
highly
recommend
mo
softly
effervescent
not
terribly
smooth
though
the
body
comes
rather
light
against
the
flavour
profile
which
again
is
not
quite
robust
either
interestingly
without
specifying
the
alc
strength
on
the
bottle
my
impression
is
that
it
goes
just
around
6
06
5abv
not
bad
but
not
the
most
complex
ive
had
either
o
great
beer
definitely
recommend
giving
this
a
try
the
body
is
full
and
smooth
but
the
crispness
is
held
firm
by
a
carbonation
thats
a
little
too
high
for
a
stout
overall
the
most
enjoyable
thing
about
this
beer
was
its
robustness
of
flavor
this
remained
true
even
though
they
kept
the
body
and
the
feel
so
light
and
easily
flowing
while
the
flavor
was
there
in
its
meaty
peaty
smokiness
the
aroma
fell
a
bit
flat
we
missed
a
lot
of
those
heavy
oaky
butters
that
youve
come
to
expect
in
any
oakedbarreled
beer
these
days
that
said
this
guy
does
its
style
a
bit
of
justice
as
pleasant
single
stouts
are
becoming
scarce
this
beer
will
hit
the
spot
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
cleanly
executed
simplicity
but
it
likely
will
not
become
your
new
favorite
as
always
as
this
is
a
new
brewery
to
us
we
remain
excited
to
see
what
else
dominion
has
got
in
their
arsenal
overall
this
is
ok
you
would
expect
more
flavor
from
a
barrel
stout
but
the
flavors
it
does
have
are
nicely
placed
this
review
is
for
the
dominion
oak
barrel
stout
in
a
12oz
bottle
and
served
in
a
tall
glass
this
beer
is
a
nice
dark
brownblack
you
cant
see
through
it
what
i
got
from
this
beer
was
a
bunch
of
oak
vanilla
chocolate
and
coffee
bean
in
that
order
if
you
are
into
those
sort
of
notes
you
will
probably
like
this
sort
of
beer
im
figuring
out
that
this
isnt
my
style
of
beer
not
a
big
fan
of
beers
like
this
i
figured
id
give
this
a
try
again
you
might
really
like
it
if
you
are
into
these
sort
of
flavors
all
in
all
an
okay
stout
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
goes
down
easy
its
possible
i
didnt
let
it
warm
up
enough
since
the
last
third
was
the
most
enjoyable
another
one
is
in
the
beer
fridge
so
if
its
significantly
different
ill
rereview
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
harvest
party
sitting
on
a
haybail
near
a
warm
fire
remembering
the
glory
days
and
trash
talking
how
da
bears
will
cream
whoever
it
is
this
weekend
m
medium
bodied
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
very
smooth
though
i
was
worried
i
wasnt
going
to
enjoy
this
as
much
since
were
in
the
dog
days
of
summer
but
its
actually
pretty
refreshing
for
a
stout
a
very
dark
color
with
a
thin
light
brown
color
head
i
have
had
a
more
frothy
head
before
so
i
am
wondering
if
there
is
carbonation
issues
or
if
time
in
the
bottle
effected
this
nontheless
the
aroma
is
clearly
vanilla
and
chocolate
with
a
light
roasted
smell
the
taste
brings
out
a
light
oak
flavor
with
the
vanilla
and
chocolate
dominating
very
smooth
feel
the
vanilla
is
quite
an
enjoyable
change
up
for
a
stout
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
certainly
have
again
so
apparently
this
beer
used
smoked
and
peated
malts
i
got
pretty
much
no
hint
of
smoke
or
meatiness
here
unless
you
count
the
touch
of
oak
throughout
but
im
sure
that
can
be
attributed
to
fermenting
with
oak
chips
overall
a
basic
and
timid
stout
kind
of
boring
and
uneventful
and
while
its
not
bad
by
any
means
it
wasnt
really
enjoyable
or
tasty
or
different
enough
for
me
to
seek
out
again
this
one
pours
dark
dark
brown
with
shallow
frothy
head
that
isnt
going
anywhere
aroma
is
vanilla
and
roasted
chocolate
taste
to
match
smooth
thick
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
again
dont
hesitate
to
give
this
one
a
try
overall
the
drinkablity
is
very
high
on
this
beer
pretty
good
buy
i
feel
for
around
2
bucks
defiantly
enjoyed
it
and
it
was
worth
the
try
i
wasnt
impressed
with
the
first
few
sips
but
some
air
and
time
turned
things
around
its
not
a
showstopper
but
damn
if
it
isnt
tasty
nice
overall
complexity
without
trying
to
be
too
much
that
touch
of
smoke
in
the
back
is
awesome
overall
pretty
solid
stout
might
have
to
look
for
more
of
this
next
time
through
delaware
overall
a
pretty
nice
drinking
stout
good
roasted
malt
flavors
with
a
nice
sweet
chocolate
and
vanilla
and
some
oakiness
b
overall
i
was
expecting
quite
a
bit
more
out
of
this
it
taste
very
much
like
a
run
of
the
mill
american
stout
really
no
oak
or
smoke
whatsoever
so
my
take
on
this
is
that
the
vanilla
and
sweetness
has
somewhat
run
away
with
the
show
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
vanilla
stout
but
that
seems
to
dominate
and
obscure
further
complexity
some
interesting
stuff
going
on
behind
that
but
i
feel
the
potential
is
left
somewhat
unfulfilled
an
interesting
experience
nonetheless
3
5
o
decent
beer
i
felt
like
it
was
missing
a
lot
it
claims
to
be
oak
barrel
aged
and
then
they
say
they
use
oak
chips
i
couldnt
find
either
of
those
in
this
beer
the
vanilla
stands
out
nicely
though
crisp
clean
lighter
styled
stout
o
overall
i
think
this
beer
looks
better
than
it
tastes
which
not
optimal
in
my
opinion
when
being
forced
to
choose
one
over
the
other
the
aroma
helps
the
overall
experience
but
doesnt
follow
through
to
the
mouth
i
would
say
its
worth
a
shot
but
i
dont
think
i
would
go
back
for
a
second
one
with
so
many
great
options
available
im
not
even
going
to
go
through
the
usual
list
sorry
but
this
beer
is
not
worth
buying
stay
away
bourbon
barrel
beer
this
is
not
stout
this
is
not
watery
charred
crap
it
is
if
you
think
this
is
worldclass
or
excellent
or
even
good
stick
with
your
coors
light
wow
only
redeeming
quality
is
some
silkiness
look
at
my
other
stout
reviews
this
is
not
one
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
almost
a
drain
pour
d
not
nearly
as
good
as
it
sounded
the
body
is
far
too
thin
to
carry
the
oak
and
vanilla
and
it
just
comes
across
as
a
mediocre
american
stout
overall
not
very
dynamic
and
pretty
watered
down
i
would
like
more
oak
too
which
actually
comes
through
in
the
aroma
more
than
the
flavor
which
is
odd
in
my
experience
its
good
but
not
quite
great
i
think
for
something
boasting
oak
aging
i
want
more
of
that
flavor
tastedark
roasted
malts
subtle
oakey
spiciness
and
vanilla
notes
roasty
and
flavorfull
a
nice
allaround
stout
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
thin
beige
head
the
aroma
brings
chocolate
roast
milk
chocolate
or
chocolate
milk
really
smooth
and
creamy
perhaps
a
touch
of
oak
if
any
at
all
vanilla
and
cream
soda
like
flavors
fairly
sweet
a
decent
beer
but
one
is
plenty
o
overall
this
is
a
tasty
wellpriced
stout
that
accomplished
its
goal
perhaps
slightly
short
of
sessionable
id
have
again
the
alcohol
was
quite
low
in
this
for
a
stout
i
didnt
notice
at
all
during
my
session
and
even
after
i
polished
off
the
contents
of
my
pint
glass
i
still
couldnt
feel
or
taste
it
at
all
while
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
there
are
so
many
other
american
stouts
and
stouts
in
general
that
are
better
than
this
was
for
a
beginner
this
would
be
a
decent
choice
for
anyone
else
this
will
probably
be
a
slight
disappointment
in
a
field
crowded
with
heavyweights
in
more
than
one
sense
of
the

you
wont
be

the

dry

give
this
beer
a
unique
taste
that
is
not
too
overwhelming
and
doesnt
take
over
your
palate
this
is
a
decent
stout
but
nothing
that
blows
me
away
it
has
typical
characteristics
of
a
traditional
stout
but
not
much
else
going
for
it
worth
trying
and
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
great
either
everything
about
this
beer
is
misleading
why
its
called
a
stout
when
it
drinks
like
an
alcoholic
soda
why
they
call
it
an
oak
barrel
stout
at
that
when
theres
barley
any
stout
flavor
to
begin
with
and
there
certainly
aint
any
oak
in
this
thing
halfway
through
my
second
one
and
i
dont
know
what
the
hell
im
gonna
do
with
the
rest
of
these
things
not
bad
enough
to
drain
pour
but
not
something
i
really
wanna
drink
either

watered
down
for
the

even
for
just
being
a
stout
it
feels
watered
down
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
it
seems
like
very
little
aging
was
done
to
this
in
barrels
and
it
seems
like
maybe
they
shouldve
worked
on
their
stout
profile
before
bothering
putting
it
in
a
barrel
truly
amazing
ale
bottled
on
103112
the
aftertaste
is
mild
and
not
too
sweet
a
very
drinkable
stout
with
character
and
how
smooth
it
is
a
very
interesting
brew
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
overall
pretty
nice
unique
malt
profile
mingling
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
is
nice
i
didnt
pick
up
much
noticeable
oak
the
slightly
thin
body
detracted
overall
but
a
very
nice
beer
o
this
beer
has
become
a
staple
with
me
and
my
friends
where
i
live
it
is
widely
available
and
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
i
know
i
will
be
able
to
find
at
most
places
it
seems
everyone
who
i
have
try
this
beer
loves
it
o
this
is
one
of
those
hidden
gems
i
regret
not
purchasing
sooner

overall
this
beer
is
very

quite
sessionable
for
a
stout
with
so
much
flavor
lacking
in
the
mouthfeel
but
also
in
the
abv
so
it
goes
hand
in
hand
great
stout
for
those
wanting
one
they
can
drink
more
and
more
of
without
getting
drunk
while
also
having
some
flavorful
nectar
to
sip
on

thin

a
scattered
lack

smell
of
the
beer
is
really
nice
its
got
a
big
roasted
aroma
upfront
with
a
sweet
natural
vanilla
aroma
in
there
as
well
the
taste
has
a
bitter
roasted
flavor
with
the
sweet
vanilla
throughout
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
has
a
carbonation
that
is
a
little
too
sharp

really
good

would

note
live
review
o
i
enjoyed
this
offering
from
old
dominion
the
complexities
keep
it
interesting
and
they
provide
a
unique
take
on
a
stout
love
the
balanced
flavor
profile
but
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
of
a
body
good
drinking
though
wonderful
nose
but
the
bulk
of
it
is
nothing
too
special
o
overall
a
nice
level
of
complexity
rich
deep
stout
sweet
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
gives
this
a
big
beer
flavor
in
a
little
bottle
smooth
drinking
and
highly
recommended
o
excellent
beer
overall
somewhat
complex
and
satisfying
taste
very
nice
to
have
a
reasonably
complex
and
rich
stout
for
a
reasonable
price
i
also
find
it
refreshing
to
have
a
rich
and
rewarding
stout
that
isnt
overly
alcoholic
i
would
very
much
like
to
see
more
rich
stouts
in
the
5
to
6
5
abv
range
this
is
probably
my
favorite
american
stout
i
especially
love
that
it
is
session
friendly
i
just
wish
the
finish
wasnt
quite
so
dry
o
found
this
one
to
be
really
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
with
a
lot
of
complexities
like
how
dominion
has
a
date
on
the
back
of
their
bottle
really
nice
light
stout
that
i
could
definitely
session
worth
a
try
if
you
like
a
light
complex
stout
cheers
an
oily

body
sits

small
less

vanilla

with
some
american
oak
tannins
cutting
through
dark

and
some
cocoa
powder
rounding
out

never
really

sweetness
peeks
out

accompanied
by
dry
toasted
oak
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
watery
in
spots
the
oak
and
vanilla
beans
are
the
real
bright
spots
here
but
this
guy
just
lacks
some
body
overall
i
find
it
quite
enjoyable
it
is
a
good
dry
stout
but
rounded
and
expanded
by
the
oak
barrel
vanilla
o
i
like
the
smokiness
of
this
one
but
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
a
bit
subdued
the
mouthfeel
is
also
lighter
than
a
traditional
stout
worth
trying
though
woody
flavored
and
pitch
black
i
would
call
this
a
typical
stout
which
does
everything
right
but
it
is
too
good
to
be
labeled
typical
the
mouth
and
nose
follow
a
main
trail
of
malt
dark
chocolate
side
paths
lead
to
a
coffee
flavor
noticeably
in
the
back
ground
there
is
a
woody
flavor
the
result
of
the
oak
barrel
i
do
not
know
but
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
it
were
the
finish
is
smooth
not
crisp
or
dry
at
all
o
this
is
a
very
oak
and
vanilla
focused
beer
it
is
also
a
very
sweet
beer
it
is
a
good
solid
stout
the
vanilla
and
the
sweetness
combine
to
give
this
beer
a
colalike
flavor
oa
decent
stout
with
nice
flavor
good
value
overall
this
is
a
very
good
stout
that
i
was
very
surprised
with
for
the
price
about
10
per
6
its
tough
to
beat
its
not
an
overpowering
stout
but
its
definitely
one
that
ill
have
again
and
recommend
to
fellow
beer
drinkers
this
is
not
an
imperial
stout
and
while
it
has
pretty
big
flavors
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
definitely
on
the
high
side
theres
just
a
little
bit
of
stickiness
but
the
overall
feel
is
almost
prickly
as
i
work
my
way
through
the
glass
it
seems
to
get
thinner
and
a
bit
watery
in
terms
of
the
intensity
of
the
flavors
rather
than
the
other
way
around
doesnt
really
ever
open
up
and
winds
up
not
being
particularly
complex
still
a
tasty
brew
for
vanilla
fans
and
an
inexpensive
buy
to
boot
o
the
taste
and
nose
were
solid
but
nothing
special
the
only
detractor
was
the
thin
body
and
prickly
carb
but
for
6
10
you
really
cant
expect
a
thick
body
ogiving
this
a
5
because
its
got
to
be
the
best
stout
ive
had
for
this
price
it
has
a
decent
complexity
to
it
seen
in
some
of
te
higher
end
aged
stouts
its
missing
a
lot
of
robustness
and
serious
flavor
but
hey
that
doesnt
bother
me
knowing
how
cheap
i
got
this
drink
and
overall
hey
pretty
solid
i
have
to
say
i
like
what
they
have
done
with
this
thinner
bodied
stout
the
addition
of
oak
chips
and
vanilla
gave
it
some
real
depth
but
it
wasnt
too
heavy
or
cloying
and
i
could
definitely
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
cheers
to
dominion
i
will
seek
out
more
of
your
brews
o
the
beer
has
a
very
good
flavor
and
is
quite
enjoyable
this
is
a
good
sipping
beer
and
i
am
glad
that
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
pretty
easy
to
drink
o
i
bought
this
bottle
at
a
wegmans
and
im
not
sure
if
anyone
else
had
quality
problems
with
the
bottles
they
bought
from
there
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
dark
brownblack
pour
opaque
with
a
small
cap
of
tan
head
that
receded
completely
after
a
few
minutes
the
recipe
boasts
peated
malts
and
vanilla
bean
but
i
didnt
really
get
either
of
these
items
in
the
aroma
or
taste
on
the
nose
a
pretty
standard
stout
dark
roasty
malts
some
milky
sweetness
and
a
vegetal
woody
quality
about
the
same
on
the
palate
dark
malts
sweet
and
roasty
oak
earthy
hops
in
the
distance
maybe
a
vague
hint
of
vanilla
somewhere
in
there
medium
mouthfeel
pretty
smooth
and
fairly
drinkable
not
what
id
call
a
goto
or
anything
might
be
better
if
the
smoke
andor
vanilla
actually
came
out
from
hiding
but
overall
its
still
a
solid
stout
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
vanilla
bean
and
slight
cocoa
taste
is
the
same
with
a
woody
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
only
a
slightly
crisp
and
thin
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
stout
with
some
mediocre
aromas
and
flavors
and
a
bad
mouthfeel
really
surprised
by
this
one
i
love
regional
beers
i
have
never
tried
that
rock
this
one
does
youll
love
it
it
pours
a
deep
black
and
is
thick
as
hell
two
fingers
of
brownish
head
and
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thing
later
that
remains
smells
oak
caramel
vanilla
coffee
smells
amazing
the
taste
matches
the
smell
a
nice
and
complex
flavor
profile
from
start
to
finish
creamy
malt
profile
up
front
balanced
with
a
bitter
finish
this
is
a
well
crafted
stout
and
that
is
very
complex
you
need
to
try
this
overall
a
good
stout
needs
a
little
more
body
however
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
more
as
it
warmed
o
good
beer
overall
especially
with
the
complexity
over
time
it
changes
even
more
as
it
warms
for
10
per
6
pack
you
cant
miss
on
this
overall
solid
ba
imperial
stout
that
is
almost
on
the
borders
of
being
a
brown
ale
with
the
nuttiness
and
salty
peanut
notes
in
the
nosetaste
of
the
brew
slightly
oxidized
but
tasty
none
the
less
loved
the
vanilla
aspect
of
this
one
pleasant
surprise
thanks

o
singularly
underwhelming
in
almost
every
way
this
beer
is
thin
mostly
flavorless
and
is
way
too
watery
for
a
robust
stout
aged
with
vanilla
and
oak
chips
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
dominion
but
ive
definitely
had
better
woof
label
says
dry
hopped
with
vanilla
but
all
i
taste
is
smokey
beer
that
is
as
dark
as
a
guiness
it
has
a
boring
label
thats
cream
in
color
with
a
brown
botlle
if
you
are
into
a
smokey
sharp
stout
this
is
a
great
beer
for
you
this
is
smokey
whiskey
and
water
overall
a
very
enjoyable
stout
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
overall
disappointing
more
porter
than
stout
the
oak
and
vanilla
defiantly
come
through
and
are
nicely
balanced
in
a
very
solid
beer
but
id
like
stronger
aromas
in
the
nose
more
body
and
better
head
retention

thin

but
this
rim
remains
smell
is
very
mild
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
and
vanilla
a
bit
of
oakeywood
hits
the
palate
with
a
sweet
milky
taste
the
more
it
warms
up
the
more
vanilla
comes
out
in
the
flavor
a
bit
bitter
finish
but
works
well
with
the
sweet
vanilla
overall
a
really
great
stout
and
as
a
fan
of
vanilla
brews
this
is
as
vanilla
as
i
ever
had
overall
a
good
stout
but
just
not
getting
the
oak
that
i
was
expecting
i
suggest
playing
the
black
crowes
w
jimmy
page
loudly
while
consuming
this
o
the
aroma
and
flavors
are
not
very
powerful
but
it
isnt
bad
i
didnt
know
anything
about
this
beer
or
brewery
but
i
wasnt
overwhelmed
the
price
was
right
though
so
i
would
rate
the
value
as
strong
o
overall
a
real
good
beer
one
of
the
better
single
stouts
i
have
had
decent
complexity
in
the
palate
profile
and
a
great
nose
i
wish
the
bourbon
characters
were
more
prominent
but
still
well
done
and
worth
a
try
especially
as
a
flavorful
sessionable
alternative
to
a
big
ris
incredibly
complex
with
more
flavors
than
i
can
name
including
touches
of
smoke
and
creamy
vanilla
as
well
as
coffee
the
layers
of
flavor
are
immense
and
all
compliment
each
other
amazingly
an
impressive
brew
wonder
if
the
oak
really
improved
this
one
sweet
malted
aroma
with
hint
of
vanilla
pours
deep
rubybrown
with
a
full
dark
beige
head
the
head
lingers
and
then
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
to
the
end
taste
is
mildly
hopped
and
lightly
sweet
from
the
vanilla
pleasing
to
the
tounge
and
palate
o
meh
medium
to
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
delicious
sipper
that
begs
to
be
gulped
the
body
is
full
and
thick
gliding
over
the
tongue
like
milk
without
becoming
overly
coating
or
sticky
the
carbonation
is
dialed
in
just
right
as
it
does
not
present
itself
much
allowing
the
flavors
to
really
pop
while
really
assisting
in
the
swallow
d
the
drink
ability
is
in
the
balance
of
this
beer
it
goes
down
more
like
a
porter
and
has
a
solid
mix
of
flavors
very
worthy
stout
from
notes
on
tap
blackbrown
pour
tan
head
with
small
amounts
sticking
to
the
glass
barrel
dominates
the
aromas
with
some
roast
malt
and
cocoa
taste
is
a
good
blend
of
all
of
these
vanilla
oak
blended
with
some
chocolate
and
roast
malt
finish
with
a
twinge
of
coffee
and
vanilla
a
little
thinner
than
one
would
like
for
a
stout
nothing
mindblowing
but
very
good
for
a
regular
stout
oak
barrel
stout
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
dark
tan
head
there
are
chocolate
and
vanilla
odors
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
is
nice
and
full
good
blend
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
with
hints
of
coffee
on
a
smokey
malty
slightly
bitter
backbone
the
flavors
arent
overpowering
and
blend
nicely
nice
creamy
consistency
great
taste
easy
to
drink
overall
a
fantastic
stout
complex
flavors
but
put
together
perfectly
im
impressed
but
it
might
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
overall
it
was
a
decent
stout
if
unremarkable
overall
this
is
a
well
done
american
stout
that
is
readily
available
i
will
say
that
1
is
enough
for
me
in
a
sitting
pick
one
up
if
you
see
it
o
this
beer
looks
great
and
is
so
smooth
but
the
nose
and
taste
are
just
above
average
in
my
opinion
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
vanilla
still
good
overall
a
little
thin
for
the
style
which
was
disappointing
to
me
overall
it
was
a
very
complex
and
satisfying
stout
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
that
i
would
drink
again
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
it
would
be
pretty
easy
to
knock
back
several
o
one
of
the
more
dynamic
tasting
regular
stouts
ive
had
the
vanilla
and
oak
definitely
add
another
dimension
but
this
brew
is
a
little
weak
overall
this
is
easily
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
ever
had
yet
it
is
very
complex
and
delicious
i
usually
like
imperial
stouts
over
regular
but
this
one
is
so
good
that
i
think
i
will
try
to
have
this
in
my
fridge
more
often
definitely
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
pours
a
brownblack
with
a
tin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
while
it
indicates
it
is
brewed
with
vanilla
this
taste
is
very
faint
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
stout
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
i
didnt
notice
much
carbonation
but
there
was
noticeable
lacing
on
the
glass
as
i
said
before
there
was
a
slight
hint
of
the
vanilla
coffee
notes
and
a
creamy
texture
to
this
one
overall
the
taste
and
smell
of
this
beer
are
quite
different
i
would
like
the
flavor
to
be
a
bit
fuller
but
still
not
bad
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
an
opaque
blackbrown
brew
with
a
fair
light
brown
cover
and
good
lacing
i
can
smell
a
mild
citrus
licorice
idea
here
theres
a
bit
of
cocoacharcoal
to
make
for
a
pleasant
but
subdued
enticement
the
taste
buds
pick
up
on
tart
charcoal
and
tasteful
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
orangecitrus
bite
the
body
is
mediumish
but
it
is
a
bit
aqueous
i
get
a
slightly
resinous
malt
finish
that
also
suggests
some
earthy
juniper
brightness
carbonation
is
tiny
spritzy
stuff
that
flows
smoothly
and
makes
for
a
very
decent
stout
that
could
prove
pretty
sessionable
recommended
o
i
love
this
beer
until
i
felt
how
thin
it
is
if
this
was
a
touch
on
the
chewier
side
this
would
be
a
world
class
stout
overall
this
beer
empties
very
well
its
an
interesting
balance
between
a
lighter
bodied
beer
and
a
strong
flavor
highly
recommended
dont
let
the
lack
of
head
and
light
color
throw
you
off
o
what
a
great
beer
i
am
still
developing
a
taste
for
stouts
but
this
one
is
great
high
marks
for
complex
flavor
and
smells
pick
one
up
pours
a
dark
brown
close
to
black
w
a
one
finger
chocolate
head
decent
lacing
on
my
snifter
nose
is
that
of
vanilla
coffee
barley
chocolate
with
the
vanilla
and
coffee
really
coming
out
front
very
smooth
though
not
bitter
taste
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
me
it
just
lacks
that
oomph
that
the
best
stouts
have
its
tasty
just
not
quite
put
together
how
id
like
feel
is
the
same
too
thin
for
the
style
and
a
little
on
the
fizzy
side
this
is
probably
the
weak
point
of
this
beer
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
something
ill
probably
seek
out
again
still
its
worth
trying
if
youve
never
had
it
cheers
opleasant
beer
would
have
again
not
a
terrible
beer
but
kind
of
strange
for
the
style
and
over
all
not
super
impressive
worth
the
under
2
though
pours

one

50
for
a
12oz
bottle
at
skyland
resort
luray
va
on
the
balancing
sweetness
i
would
have
liked
it
even
more
overall
i
would
recommend
this
one
bottled
021711
and
was
amazingly
smooth
tasted
as
if
it
had
some
age
on
it
complex
and
smoooth
oh
and
for
the
record
moving
dominion
brewing
out
of
virginia
the
old
dominion
state
should
require
you
to
change
the
fcking
name
o
its
certainly
not
the
best
oak
aged
and
infused
beer
ive
had
but
its
a
solid
enough
american
stout
with
some
extra
flair
thrown
in
it
the
6
1
abv
makes
it
a
nice
choice
to
pair
with
a
chocolate
or
raspberry
dessert
or
both
or
even
a
couple
as
dessert
itself
d
great
complexity
between
the
wood
and
vanilla
just
nice
to
have
some
other
flavors
worked
into
your
standard
roast
chocolate
sweet
stout
flavors
very
enjoyable
and
unique
american
stout
o
a
great
stout
some
beautiful
notes
and
a
great
mouthfeel
this
is
an
awesome
stout
and
it
will
be
making
a
reappearance
in
the
fridge
worthy
thanks
robo
for
the
opportunity
o
not
a
good
stout
at
least
this
bottle
wasnt
barely
a
mediocre
beer
i
finished
it
but
i
wouldnt
have
really
cared
if
it
disappeared
drinkable
but
why
would
you
mouthfeel
and
a
general
weakness
of
character
ruins
any
chance
at
more
than
a
passable
brew
absolutely
not
recommended
though
you
could
do
much
worse
i
wont
be
having
another
o
its
good
for
what
it
is
id
like
to
try
one
with
a
bit
more
vanilla
on
it
i
think
thats
a
special
kind
of
this
one
right
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
not
necessarily
what
i
was
expecting
to
get
but
a
good
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
nonetheless
at
the
old
dominion
brewery
located
in
terminal
a
of
dulles
and
the
second
beer
i
am
trying
is
the
oak
barrel
stout
the
color
poured
deep
dark
rich
amber
with
ecru
colored
head
the
aroma
is
roasty
with
good
malt
balance
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
complex
the
peat
and
vanilla
are
very
apparent
there
definitely
smokey
undertones
and
flashes
of
aniseblack
licorice
the
body
is
decent
right
on
the
borderline
of
being
too
watery
for
me
the
mouthfeel
is
good
for
me
it
would
be
tough
to
have
more
than
two
or
three
at
a
sitting
a
lot
of
tasty
notes
going
on
but
seem
kind
of
superficial
zappow
still
pretty
enjoyable
really
didnt
even
pick
up
on
the
barrel
character
fun
no
less
o
very
good
american
stout
overall
could
become
my
go
to
local
stout
highly
recommend
it
was
truly
amazingthe
color
smell
teste
was
just
awsome
i
do
suggest
if
u
get
this
beer
in
the
bottle
let
it
rest
b4
drinking
i
found
this
to
be
better
but
thats
just
me
enjoy
really
solid
stout
quite
ideal
flavor
profile
at
its
abv
overall
recommended
if
youre
looking
for
an
inexpensive
but
tasty
alternative
to
guinness
try
a
dominion
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
with
a
2
finger
khaki
head
that
leaves
a
thin
film
for
the
remainder
of
the
beer
loose
lacing
dribbles
down
the
glass
smell
is
notes
of
coffee
raisins
and
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
taste
is
very
smooth
with
an
even
balance
of
roasted
malts
that
are
not
too
overpowering
very
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
having
an
oak
barrel
stout
that
is
not
through
the
roof
with
a
high
abv
wonderful
take
on
the
classic
stout
style
taste
the
oak
a
little
bit
a
tad
more
would
be
nice
great
brew
though
o
a
very
balanced
stout
with
tons
of
flavor
and
complexity
this
one
is
awesome
this
beer
had
a
beautiful
appearance
for
a
stout
nice
fluffy
head
smell
and
taste
were
very
smooth
yet
flavorful
overall
for
a
stout
not
an
imperial
stout
this
one
was
balanced
and
not
watery
or
weak
like
so
many
others
a
well
made
stout
worth
sampling
many
thanks
to
mdaschaf
for
this
extra
in
our
recent
trade
actually
the
second
time
to
try
it
but
the
first
time
to
review
it
poured
into
my
dfh
snifter
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
tan
head
that
fills
the
top
of
the
glass
then
recedes
leaving
nice
tan
lacing
on
my
glass
smell
brown
sugar
molasses
taste
brown
sugar
first
thick
carbonation
brown
sugar
oak
vanilla
on
the
end
kick
ass
so
much
going
on
here
zero
alcohol
detected
here
at
all
its
not
a
big
abv
beer
but
this
is
pure
flavor
with
no
heat
mouthfeel
nice
rich
carbonation
smooth
medium
bodied
stout
drinkability
im
intensely
jealous
i
cant
get
this
beer
in
texas
i
could
easily
see
this
being
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
12oz
bottle
poured
into

bottled

black
body
with
a
thick
and
creamy
tan
head
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
my
nose
picks
up
bitter
chocolate
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
coffee
the
taste
is
the
same
but
add
in
some
caramel
brown
sugar
and
something
boozy
low
abv
for
that
but
it
seems
to
be
there
full
bodied
low
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
good
beer
and
my
first
from
dominion
if
this
is
any
indication
of
what
they
offer
then
i
will
be
back
asap
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
i
would
gladly
try
again
but
do
not
see
myself
buying
again
unless
something
more
interesting
is
not
available
due
to
the
fact
that
this
was
given
to
me
by
a
beerofthemonth
subscriber
i
consider
myself
lucky
to
try
a
beer
of
such
limitation
not
much
to
say
about
this
other
than
how
amazing
easy
it
is
to
drink
its
one
of
those
beers
you
tell
your
buddies
cmon
just
try
it
its
perfect
for
new
and
experienced
drinkers
alike
definitely
make
a
trade
or
pick
some
up
if
your
in
the
area
stay
thirsty
my
friends
a
pretty
nice
stout
overall
but
a
little
heavy
on
the
vanilla
which
masks
the
rich
malts
utilized
here
nice
bitterness
though
i
brewed
a
vanilla
bourbon
porter
using
a
tincture
in
the
dry
hop
that
tasted
quite
similar
fuller
medium
body
high
carbonation
a
bit
dry
and
tingly
on
the
tongue
which
i
usually
dont
prefer
for
this
style
this
drinks
okay
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
lower
which
was
nice
but
not
really
what
im
looking
for
from
an
oak
aged
vanilla
bean
stout
o
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
stout
i
had
one
but
could
have
had
3
or
4
overall
a
average
beer
at
best
to
mild
and
bland
for
my
liking
too
easy
to
drink
for
what
style
it
is
maybe
a
good
starter
for
a
stout
drinker
but
not
worthy
after
youve
had
a
kbs
or
old
rasputin
another
of
over
150
different
brews
that
has
arrived
at
my
doorstep
via
botmc
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
combination
of
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
almost
a
roasted
malted
milk
ball
smell
this
is
a
new
one
for
my
olfactories
and
is
quite
pleasing
this
brew
pours
to
a
motor
oil
color
and
consistency
with
a
tan
yet
transitioning
from
darker
to
light
head
consisting
of
multisized
bubbles
ranging
from
medium
to
small
with
a
pillow
top
head
laces
as
it
recedes
on
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
quickly
stands
out
as
highly
viscous
and
silky
the
taste
then
starts
with
a
milky
roasted
flavor
that
slowly
ascends
to
a
sweeter
chocolate
and
vanilla
then
transitions
to
a
smoky
bitterness
that
still
remains
sweet
in
the
background
the
finish
stays
bittersweet
throughout
this
is
a
delicious
brew
i
highly
recommend
d
very
high
especially
for
the
style
nothing
comes
on
too
strong
but
all
the
flavors
are
there
on
the
taste
buds
and
it
feels
nice
in
the
mouth
would
have
been
nice
to
see
a
little
more
bitterness
or
roast
character
but
the
vanilla
and
sweetness
are
welcome
too
drinks
pretty
good
not
bad
at
all
o
well
this
isnt
a
bad
american
stout
but
theres
not
really
much
barrel
flavor
here
despite
the
name
there
is
some
oaklike
vanilla
but
its
pretty
subtle
the
brewing
is
fair
enough
but
just
doesnt
deliver
the
barrel
expectations
very
well
overall
though
this
is
kind
of
surprising
this
is
not
what
i
expected
for
this
style
i
was
thinking
more
of
big
roast
and
chocolatecoffeelicorice
sort
of
for
this
style
but
its
basically
rauchbier
light
to
me
and
a
good
one
to
boot
o
very
easy
drinking
and
a
very
good
tasting
stout
im
not
a
stout
lover
and
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
4
o
really
surprisingly
good
didnt
expect
to
love
it
like
this
but
for
the
style
and
abv
the
taste
is
phenomenal
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
into
a
little
package
the
label
says
that
it
was
bottled
on
01172011
and
it
was
reviewed
on
03182011
but
the
beer
didnt
seem
up
to
par
to
me
anyway
i
havent
had
a
known
fresh
sample
of
it
so
im
not
sure
that
it
was
stale
but
my
experience
doesnt
really
follow
along
with
the
others
i
had
this
from
a
bottle
poured
in
to
a
samuel
adams
glass
this
stout
was
black
as
night
with
a
beautiful
tan
head
that
reduces
to
a
nice
thin
lace
on
top
this
has
smell
of
a
robust
coffee
the
first
sip
is
of
coffee
with
a
hints
of
vanilla
at
the
end
overall
this
is
a
really
flavorful
stout
this
stout
is
smooth
drinking
definitely
on
of
my
favorites
very
tasty
dominion
oak
barrel
stout
has
a
black
colour
and
a
5
mm
tan
head
that
lasts
awhile
and
maintains
good
lacing
the
smell
is
all
chocolate
and
and
woodiness
the
taste
is
quite
hoppy
to
begin
with
but
the
roasty
charcoal
and
woodiness
take
over
quickly
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
with
some
charcoal
this
beer
has
a
good
foamy
texture
overall
a
decent
oakaged
stout
although
not
especially
interesting
as
they
would
say
in
chicago
you
can
put
it
on
the
boaaard
yes
overall
not
used
to
lower
alcohol
oakaged
stouts
i
like
it
proves
that
a
brewer
can
be
innovative
with
overdoing
the
abv
or
ibus
sampled
from
a
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
totally
black
in
color
poured
with
an
ample
beige
head
that
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
and
light
sticky
lacings
sweet
vanilla
and
dark
roasted
malt
aromas
vanilla
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
in
the
beginning
that
transition
to
coffee
flavors
and
a
bitter
hoppy
ending
vanilla
coffee
and
hop
flavors
combine
at
the
end
to
leave
a
black
licoricelike
taste
in
the
back
of
the
throat
and
nose
very
easy
to
drink
d
a
solid
stout
bolstered
by
a
delicious
vanilla
character
i
could
definitely
have
a
couple
of
these
without
a
problem
the
appearance
is
pretty
darn
black
for
a
just
a
regular
old
stout
the
aromatics
are
pretty
bland
there
is
some
oak
woodsiness
in
the
background
but
there
is
no
malt
characteristics
in
the
aroma
at
all
the
flavor
is
actually
really
damn
good
there
is
a
lot
of
vanilla
in
the
flavor
some
of
it
from
oak
some
of
it
from
added
vanilla
the
barrel
is
palatable
and
you
can
taste
the
dank
oak
the
roasted
malt
flavor
is
pretty
weak
but
it
does
exist
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
really
creamy
and
it
was
really
really
nice
this
was
really
really
tasty
as
far
as
drinkability
it
was
really
nice
but
there
was
something
still
generic
about
it
overall
still
a
pleasant
surprise
from
a
random
stout
d
very
drinkable
possible
session
if
youre
in
the
darkerbeer
mood
with
a
slight
vanilla
twist
would
be
fantastic
with
dark
rich
chocolate
desserts
might
be
an
interesting
twist
with
a
swissmushroomburger
definitely
not
fish
or
steak
drinkability
was
good
i
enjoyed
it
and
if
i
were
in
the
mood
to
session
stouts
this
would
be
a
candidate
i
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
and
finished
the
six
pack
over
the
course
of
the
week
being
basically
as
stout
with
some
oak
notes
it
sure
as
hell
is
a
lot
tastier
than
a
guinness
draught
and
i
would
order
this
at
a
bar
given
the
option
ill
be
reaching
for
something
else
though
this
beer
is
very
different
from
all
of
the
other
stouts
ive
tried
in
a
not
so
good
way
the
flavors
are
very
lively
perhaps
because
of
the
sodalike
effervescence
continuously
arising
to
the
top
but
those
flavors
are
not
well
balanced
i
feel
like
this
beer
was
an
experiment
in
brewing
and
marketing
an
oak
aged
beer
pours
a
near
black
color
with
a
small
tan
film
on
top
very
little
lacing
smell
is
very
subdued
some
roasted
malts
and
a
little
chocolate
and
coffee
chocolate
malt
although
mild
is
the
most
dominate
flavor
in
the
palate
followed
by
lactose
sweetness
and
a
kiss
of
oak
from
the
oak
chips
that
were
added
the
oak
character
is
nice
because
it
is
subtle
and
doesnt
hide
the
other
flavors
like
some
stouts
that
are
actually
aged
in
barrels
the
thing
is
there
isnt
alot
of
other
flavors
the
vanilla
beans
get
lost
completely
and
there
is
no
prominent
hop
flavors
also
the
roasted
malt
and
coffee
in
the
nose
doesnt
really
show
up
yet
the
chocolate
and
oak
are
enough
to
make
it
work
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
rolls
around
nicely
overall
an
approachable
and
enjoyable
stout
that
due
to
its
mild
flavor
profle
is
quite
drinkable

taste
is
moderately
sweet
with

and

i
dont
exactly
pick
up
on
the
vanilla
but
it
may
be
responsible
for
some
of
the
residual
sweetness
taste
is
more
like
a
milk
stout
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
my
only
complaint
is
naming
a
beer
aged
on
oak
chips
oak
barrel
stout
just
a
touch
misleading
d
a
sipper
due
the
amount
of
oak
in
this
still
very
drinkable
and
can
have
multiple
bottles
in
a
sitting
if
not
in
the
mood
for
a
monster
stout
this
is
a
very
good
alternative
a
lot
of
flavor
and
character
and
perfect
carbonation
for
this
level
of
beer
might
need
a
touch
more
vanilla
but
otherwise
very
good
beer
d
by
no
means
complex
still
not
bad
if
your
looking
for
a
easy
drinker
good
price
point
for
what
you
get
i
think
not
my
favorite
but
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
i
left
wanting
a
little
more
pours
a
slightly
thick
very
dark
brown
with
a
thick
creamy
light
tan
head
aroma
isnt
huge
but
is
quite
nice
with
scents
of
roasted
nuts
cofee
a
bit
of
charred
wood
and
a
chocolate
malt
ball
note
flavor
is
solid
but
nothing
special
smoked
wood
and
roasted
coffee
up
front
with
the
slightest
hint
of
oak
and
vanilla
coming
in
late
with
a
lingering
coffee
finish
palate
is
a
bit
light
for
a
stout
and
felt
slightly
thin
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
overall
a
decent
stout
that
with
a
little
more
style
could
be
quite
delicious
overall
full
flavored
full
bodied
yet
easy
to
drink
what
a
great
take
on
the
style
has
everything
you
ask
for
in
the
style
poured
aggressively
only
a
brief
1finger
head
reduces
to
almost
nothing
almost
no
lacing
caramel
head
and
black
in
color
aroma
of
smoked
malt
no
oak
and
vanilla
as
stated
on
the
bottle
although
i
havent
gotten
to
tasting
yet
more
aroma
of
chocolate
and
dark
malts
taste
of
a
little
smoke
chocolate
roasted
malts
no
oak
and
only
slight
vanilla
when
breathing
out
while
tasting
even
at
5
2
abv
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
aaand
that
sucks
i
would
only
recommend
this
beer
as
a
dark
beer
option
for
a
gettogether
or
party
or
something
otherwise
i
would
not
seek
out
this
beer
the
pour
doesnt
look
too
dark
it
gathers
pretty
black
though
the
head
is
small
but
nice
while
it
lasts
a
couple
rings
of
lacing
are
left
behind
the
smell
is
nice
but
kinda
toned
down
its
pretty
damn
woody
with
a
sweet
kick
of
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
the
flavor
falls
kinda
flat
its
missing
a
big
velvety
richness
theres
just
a
thin
vanilla
taste
with
an
oaky
finish
with
a
dr
pepper
flavor
somewhere
in
between
the
body
is
extremely
too
thin
it
really
ruins
any
chances
this
beer
has
at
being
smooth
and
creamy
the
body
isnt
even
enough
to
give
the
sharp
carbonation
something
to
struggle
through
it
has
a
very
prickly
feeling
a
very
dry
finish
is
very
abrupt
in
all
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
i
wont
have
a
problem
finishing
it
especially
at
this
5
2
abv
it
just
leaves
me
wanting
much
more
i
really
liked
the
taste
of
this
beer
with
the
vanilla
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
front
the
roasted
malt
dominating
the
middle
and
the
bittersweet
aftertaste
in
the
back
nicely
balanced
a
very
drinkable
stout
good
job
dominion
brewery
d
very
easy
to
drink
beer
nothing
overwhelming
but
solid
everything
is
balanced
although
would
want
a
little
more
flavor
out
of
an
oak
aged
stout
still
with
the
lower
abv
would
be
great
to
have
a
sixer
of
this
on
a
snowy
night
d
nice
this
isnt
the
most
complex
or
mind
blowing
stout
out
there
but
its
very
drinkable
and
does
down
easily
id
drink
this
again
drinkability
is
high
as
it
has
a
low
abv
and
is
a
nice
sipper
good
for
a
night
you
want
to
sip
a
few
but
not
get
drunk
d
very
tasty
but
heavy
and
thick
nothing
overpowering
and
no
alcohol
presence
heavy
enough
to
be
a
sipper
though
dvery
nice
lacking
a
bit
in
depth
perhaps
but
very
tasty
taste
nice
mild
the
slightest
amount
of
vanilla
very
light
bourbon
presence
same
with
the
oak
this
is
a
nice
example
of
making
a
full
bodied
wood
aged
stout
without
having
it
be
of
such
abv
that
will
wreck
you
a
twist
of
leather
for
ya
hints
of
chocolate
hints
of
everything
nothing
is
massive
but
it
still
is
full
of
flavor
a
very
drinkable
stout
at
a
good
price
3
a
single
di
have
drank
a
couple
of
these
at
different
times
and
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
the
weird
flavor
cuts
into
its
drinkability
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
pleasant
carbonation
and
quite
drinkable
i
could
probably
drink
a
bunch
of
these
pours
a
black
with
a
pretty
big
tan
head
that
leaves
pretty
good
lacing
the
nose
is
of
roasted
malt
sweet
vanilla
and
coffee
the
taste
is
strong
of
vanilla
with
a
healthy
dose
of
coffee
and
some
roasted
malt
its
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
and
not
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
but
an
alright
beer
and
definitely
worth
trying
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
but
not
extremely
drinkable
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
a
very
nice
session
one
at
that
black
with
dark
brown
highlights
and
a
dense
brown
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
solid
prominently
roasty
with
a
blend
of
heavily
kilned
and
mildly
charred
malts
the
added
vanilla
bean
character
is
noticeable
and
quite
enjoyable
oak
isnt
particularly
noticeable
on
the
nose
which
is
surprising
given
that
this
was
aged
on
chips
rather
than
barrels
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
appears
as
this
beer
warms
up
the
palate
is
just
as
good
as
the
nose
with
a
very
enjoyable
level
of

is
low
apart
from
the

that
appears
midpalate
theres
not
much
by
way
of

here
mediumlight
in

with
soft

this
feels
pretty
smooth
on
the

the

is

and
bitter
with
plenty
of
roasted
grain
and
a
little

very
good
especially
at
420oz
pour
ill
revisit
this
for
sure
this
is
very
drinkable
brew
for
a
stout
i
was
amazed
the
flavor
is
strong
but
not
overbearing
its
a
hearty
brew
but
still
goes
down
easy
i
could
surely
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
and
enjoy
every
drop
the
price
seems
to
be
pretty
good
as
well
once
again
i
am
super
impressed
with
dominion
mfd
silky

on
the

with
its
share
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
amazing
low

at

and
great
flavors
for
the
style
its
by
far
the
best
of
this
style
that
ive
ever
had
if
youre
looking
for
a
hityouoverthehead
stout
this
isnt
for
you
the
bitterness
is
balanced
with
sweetness
the
vanilla
complements
the
coffee
and
the
overall
taste
does
not
demolish
the
palate
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
pours
dark
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
nose
brings
some
lift
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
hints
of
vanilla
a
bit
of
oak
taste
is
malty
with
a
light
oak
touch
decent
feel
with
some
tannins
pretty
good
but
a
bit
plain
for
what
it
is
good
beer
to
relax
in
the
evening
after
a
long
day
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
2
in
evening
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
nuclear
free
beer
festival
the
aroma
and
even
the
taste
brought
early
childhood
memories
back
there
was
a
store
on
m
st
in
georgetown
called
the
georgetown
coffee
and
tea
shop
that
is
what
it
reminded
me
of
i
would
go
in
there
every
sunday
after
church
and
i
always
loved
the
smell
it
was
nice
and
balanced
and
finished
like
a
good
espresso
edit
recently
got
to
try
one
of
the
early
vintages
of
this
brew
it
was
very
solid
whats
produces
nowadays
ehhh
not
so
much
drinkability
is
excellent
given
the
alcohol
a
standout
brew
quite
frankly
i
wish
they
distributed
here
before
my
friend
finally
picked
up
the
keg
to
send
it
back
i
poured
another
hit
of
this
stuff
into
a
growler
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
poured
it
into
my
old
old
dominion
brewing
company
growler
from
a
very
fine
brewpub
that
is
no
longer
in
existence
sad
d
man
where
have
you
guys
been
all
my
life
i
have
been
kicking
around
equally
as
cheap
stouts
and
exposed
to
some
that
taste
as
good
for
double
the
price
but
i
have
no
idea
how
they
can
just
throw
this
at
you
with
a

would

a

theres

of
roasted

at

stout
enjoyable
to
say
the

coming
from

with

of

the
inclusion
of
the

the

a

interesting
but
the
smokey
peat
aroma

overdone
and
distracting
d
fairly
drinkable
because
of
the
light
body
i
think
a
better
feel
would
make
me
like
it
even
more
however
d
the
flavors
are
balanced
and
i
could
definitely
enjoy
a
few
of
these
again
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
like
but
still
good
overall
this
is
a
nice
low
alcohol
easy
to
understand
stout
while
nothing
exciting
its
still
a
pleasant
easy
to

is
the

probably
not

place
to
enjoy
this
beer
md
silky

thin
on
the

little

no

the
thinness
makes
this

easy

constrains

i
could
easily

this
is

pretty

the

arent

i
have
sampled
this
beer
a
few
times
in
the
pastthis
is
the
first
bottle
i
have
had
to
myself
poured
into
a

a
deep
dark
but
not
opaque
cola
color
with
a
minimal
light
mocha
colored
head
atop
aromas
of

and
dark
coffee
stand
out
most
with
just
a
hint
of
molasses
as
well
a
little
thin
and
prickly
in
the
mouthfeel
department
but
not
overly
annoying
flavors
are
dominated
by
vanilla
and
heavy
roast
up
front
with
a
drying
earthywoodiness
that
comes
thru
in
a
long
finish
its
a
year
and
a
half
old
but
i
dont
think
it
matters
mucha
decent
flavorful
stout
d
very
drinkable
i
could
put
a

of
these
away
pretty
easily
not
the

stout
ive
ever

bottled
on

indicated
on
the

poured
one
shade
shy
of
black
with
a
loose

that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
skim
with
a
band
of

around

taste
consistent
with

but
very
muted
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
watery
with
a
light
background
carbonation
and
a
slight
acidity
not
bad
but
somewhat
lackluster
i
had
high
hopes
for
oak
barrel
stout
but
am
ultimately
disappointed
its
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
has
some
glaring
flaws
the
carbonation
is
the
biggest
the
lack
of
any
standout
in
flavor
is
the
second
overall
its
above
average
but
would
need
some
work
to
reach
the
next
level
its
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
d
very
drinkable
well
not
very
drinkable
but
maybe
2
of
these
to
truly
understand
its
complex
flavors
overall
the
beer
come
across
to
me
as
plain
but
in
another
sense
the
beer
is
rather
simple
the
mouth
feel
is
a
medium
body
not
chewy
and
a
bit
creamy
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
dry
the
beer
lingers
for
a
moment
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
good
but
not
great
it
needs
more
character
and
body
d
would
make
an
excellent
session
stout
though
just
a
bit
high
on
the
abv
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
deep
opaque
sable
with
a
finebubbled
tan
head
strong
aroma
is
smoky
and
coffeeish
and
slightly
chocolaty
rich
flavor
is
like
a
good
mocha
and
has
a
yeasty
undertone
along
with
nutty
and
molasses
hints
texture
is
smooth
and
a
little
tingly
would
have
this
again
a
very
nice
stout
though
slightly
undistinguished
d
not
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
too
much
oak
and
a
thinner
than
expected
mouthfeel
makes
for
a
brew
which
after
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
the
aroma
is
almost
prototypical
for
the
style
it
has
coffee
chocolate
burnt
malt
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
larger
than
average
head
for
a
stout
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
a
tad
thin
but
ok
overall
its

decent

this
is
a

brew
and
thus
far
a
highlight
in
my
beer
journey
however
limited
that
may
be
pours
an
opaque
dark

aged
oh
wait
a

only
oak
chips
were

there
is
a
much

citrusy
hop
profile
in
the
nose
that
i
had
expected
faint
notes
of
caramel
malt
and
roasted
chocolate
light
in
body
hardly
any
chew
going
on
simple
roasted
chocolate
malts
and
some
hints
at
roasted
coffee
beans
the
carbonation
is
insane
the
way
overthetop
carbonation
hurts
its
body
and
mouthfeel
subtle
notes
of
vanilla
sweet
wet
wood
and
lemony
sourness
on
the
finish
this
one
was
a
disappointment
maybe
put
the
beer
in
a
barrel
next
time
poured
a
perfect
shade
of
black
with
a
frothy
sleek
onefinger
head
that
was
tan
and
then
slowly
died
and
left
a
ring
around
the
glass
a
light
malt
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
sweet
malts
like
caramel
mixed
with
cocoa
and
coffee
and
yes
oak
mediumtofull
bodied
really
really
sweet
and
smooth
creaminess
the
beer
is
balanced
with
hints
of
dryness
and
although
it
goes
down
somewhat
silky
it
has
a
moderately
dry
backbone
roasted
toffee
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
all
make
their
way
in
the
taste
i
could

i
have
a

more

each
drinks
better
than

smokiness

extreme
drinkability
overall
pretty
decent
stout
was
slightly
sweet
reminded
me
of
a
milk
stout
but
it
was
very
tasty
the
oak
and
vanilla
flavors
were
strong
and
it
worked
very
well
together
to
give
a
very
drinkable
complex
stout
that
wasnt
a
sipper
this
beer
is
awesome
im
pleased
to
see
somebody
making
a

stout
that
isnt

you
in

was

to

for
the
style
but
the
creaminess
sits
well
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
thick
and
almost
creamy
what
i
would
really
expect
from
a
stout
a
very
nice
beer
overall
d
drinkability
is
good
alcohol
is
very
light
and
this
beer
is
creamier
than
most
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
an
evening
with
no
problems
if
i
had
access
to
this
beer
i
might
even
have
it
in
my
fridge
from
time
to
time
the
vanilla
in
the
aroma
threw
me
off
at
first
because
it
was
so
strong
but
after
a
few
sips
the
vanilla
is
hard
to
even
pick
out
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
drinkability
for
me
on
this
one
is
tarnished
by
the
thin
mouthfeel
id
not
want
more
than
one
of
these
as
there
isnt
enough
in
it
to
make
it
more
than
a
starter
effort

smooth
on
the
palate
a
very
easy
good
drinking
beer
its
a
shame
whats
going
on
with
the
brewery
but
this
will
always
be
a
good
beer
in
my
memories
creamy
mouthfeel
this
was
a
real
taste
bud
pleaser
glad
i
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
as
i
will
be
enjoying
this
all
week
bottling
date
of
080808
d
good
a
great
beer
could
have
several
but
its
nice
just
to
savor
it
d
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
buy
again
pours
a
thin
dark
reedish
black
and
3
fingers
of
head
rose
to
the
top
of
this
one
the
flavors
are
bitter
chocklat
and
lightly
roasted
coffiee
then
a
smokey
flavor
takes
over
in
the
middle
the
end
is
a
bunch
of
hops
and
some
strong
vanilla
that
is
in
purfict
ballance
with
the
mild
oak
flavor
that
is
the
last
sutle
flavor
you
are
left
with
after
swallowing
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
tons
of
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
this
one
i
will
savor
every
one
of
these
that
i
am
lucky
to
have
in
my
posetion
the
mouth
is
extremely
silky
but
thins
out
a
bit
in
the
end
it
is
easy
to
session
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
well
done
neat
interpretation
of
an
american
stout
might
be
a
little
light
bodied
balance
wise
could
use
a
bit
more
overall
pours
very
black
like
cokeand
rich
with
a
nice
dark
head
the
smell
and
taste
of
oak
is
very
noticeable
the
beer
has
a
very
earthy
smell
and
taste
it
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
may
be
my
favorite
beer
in
this
category
it
is
a
great
bridge
beer
between
lighter
beers
and
hard
core
stouts
i
hope
ab
incs
marketing
takes
this
beer
to
more
markets
to
show
its
true
potential
d
really
easy
to
drink
d
a
very
good
stout
tastes
like
itd
pair
well
with
a
good
steak
i
can
definately
see
myself
drinking
a
couple

flavors
yummy
not
the
most
complex
stout
in
the
world
and
actually
kind
of
thin
in
the
middle
but
there
are
some
tasty
flavors
in
there
its
kind
of
confusing
slightly
watery
but
flavorful
medium
bodied
goes
down
easy
enough
ill
get
it
again
but
i
feel
like
with
a
couple
tweaks
it
could
be
great
d
an
aboveaverage
stout
that
blends
sweet
flavors
with
an
appropriately
dry
finish
that
hits
the
americansweet
stout
style
pretty
well
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
considering
the
complexity
at
work
this
one
has
a
lot
of
character
and
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
this
is
a
great
american
stout
and
the
solid
mouthfeel
and
flavor
make
it
one
to
be
enjoyed
slowly

this
is

my
review
may
have
sounded
a
little
harsh
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
just
expected
a
little
more
i
would
have
loved
to
see
more
of
the
vanilla
and
any
oak
i
did
enjoy
the

i
picked
this
up
randomly
at
the
grocery
store
which
made
me
think
it
wasnt
going
to
be
that
great
im
glad
i
was
wrong
this
beer
is
a
little
too
complex
for
me
to
pick
everything
out
but
it
tastes
so
well
rounded
and
delicious
this
beer
seems
to
be
backwards
from
what
i
usually
experience
as
it
was
kind
if
astringentbitter
at
first
and
finished
sweet
the
bourbon
barrel
process
gives
it
the
taste
of
a
much
higher
alcohol
beer
very
interesting
i
will
definitely
get
this
one
again
got
lucky
enough
to
get
stuck
at
bwi
airport
in
baltimore
and
went
to
rams
head
tried
the
copperhead
first
and
liked
it
next
i
tried
this
wonderful
stout
extremely
smooth
and
very
flavorful
of
course
the
malts
were
just
right
each
drink
left
that
leveled

that
the

are
telling
about

hope
to
get
stuck
at
bwi
again
soon
overall
a
unique
balanced
and
somewhat
complex
brew
though
not
too
complex
to
keep
someone
familiar
with
stouts
from
downing

may
hold
some

but
has
all
the
makings
of
a
big
beer
with
out
any
of
them
overshadowing
the
beer
really
a
good
brew
this
robust
black
stout
sports
a
great
tancolored
head
that
has
very
good
retention
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
this
is
also
a
rather
complex
stout
with
a
coffee
nose
evolving
into
a
chocolate
malt
flavor
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
thick
though
many
stouts
this
flavorful
are
a
bit
heavier
in
the
mouth
this
one
is
lightened
even
more
by
a
carbonation
level
that
is
a
bit
higher
than
most
stouts
but
makes
the
drink
refreshing
combined
with
this
the
subtle
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
gives
it
a
crisp
finale
the
oak
the
vanilla
and
the
roast
malt
are
all
in
perfect
proportion
the
brewers
have
struck
a
harmony
between
the
creaminess
and
the
roast
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
dominions
oak
barrel
stout
is
a
beverage
that
is
all
those
things
at
once
and
that
is
something
of
a
marvel
a
delicious
delicious
flavoured
marvel
the
brewers
have
listed
this
on
the
label
as
their
little
treasure
indeed
it
is
and
i
owe
a
big
thanks
to
idatetheformula
for
sending
me
this
gem
md
low
carbonation
and
it
was
rich
creamy
and
smooth
so
it
was
highly
drinkable
overall
if
i
could
find
this
beer
in
atlanta
it
would
probably
become
a
stable
in
my
fridge
excellent
beer
highly
recommend
overall
very
drinkable
especially
for
stout
lovers
not
extreme
not
super
hoppy
not
overthetop
but
an
enjoyable
brew
id
have
another
if
made
available
again
d
drinks
very
easy
for
a
stout
nice
complex
flavor
would
serve
this
with
a
dessert
the
beer
poured
an
inkblack
with
a
thick
tan
head
into
a
pint
glass
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
barleyburnt
toast
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
a
big
roasted
barley
and
burnt
toast
combination
slightly
astringent
with
black
patent
malt
and
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
excellent
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
with
low
carbonation
i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
and
most
of
the
other
old
dominion
offerings
as
well
d
really
not
your
typical
stout
but
i
really
like
it
if
the
mouthfeel
were
heavier
this
might
become
too
sweet
and
dessert
like
not
the
malty
flavors
of
normal
stouts
but
it
works
this
isnt
a
beer
i
think
i
would
typically
like
but
every
one
i
have
gets
better
and
better
d
rather
drinkable
an
old
friend
i
hadnt
had
in
a
few
years
dominion
is
a
solid
beer
that
manages
to
integrate
barrelaging
pretty
well
d
very
drinkable
excellent
for
sessions
an
interesting
stout
worthwhile
m
d
quite
nice
the
bourbon
flavours
didnt
stand
out
like
i
might
have
thought
but
its
still
there
carbonation
sizzle
over
the
tongue
was
kept
to
a
minimum
and
suited
the
brew
quite
smooth
silky
and
amazingly
refreshing
though
i
still
wouldnt
drink
the
style
as
any
sort
of
thirst
quencher
a
very
nice
release
from
old
dominion
though
i
find
it
very
unusual
that
this
isnt
available
here
in
charlottesville
it
might
be
worth
the
drive
to
richmond
this
one
was
a
little
too
thin
for
me
ive
not
had
it
fresh
but
it
was
a
little
underwhelming
with
a
year
on
it
not
bad
by
any
means
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
one
smells
outstanding
poured
directly
from
the
bottle
slightly
sweet
and
quite
toasted
the
head
disappears
quite
quickly
leaving
a
dark
pleasing
baking
chocolate
color
beer
this
great
start
is
somewhat
let
down
once
you
get
the
beer
into
your
mouth
however
the
prominent
toasty
oakiness
in
the
smell
is
very
subtle
in
the
flavor
which
is
lighter
than
many
beers
in
this
style
and
flees
the
pallet
quite
abruptly
the
negligable
mouthfeel
and
aftertaste
makes
this
beer
easy
to
drink
which
i
guess
is
a
plus
its
not
bad
but
i
wont
be
recommending
it
to
anyone
who
is
looking
for
an
oak
aged
stout
overall
havent
had
1
of
these
in
a
few
years
and
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
solid
and
easily
drinkable
still
as
good
as
i
remembered
an
inch
and
a
half
of
thick
creamy
foam
head
is
a
milk
chocolate
brown
that
fades
to
just
a
skim
as
i
finish
this
sentence
body
is
a
usuall
suspect
jet
oil
black
nose
is
very
big
with
luscious
roasty
and
carmalized
malt
tones
jumping
at
the
senses
yeasty
rich
alchol
notes
also
tingle
within
the
nose
on
first
sip
you
get
a
mix
of
sour
and
glazing
bitter
richness
which
is
all
up
front
there
is
a
carmalized
malt
feel
that
draws
out
nicely
on
the
palate
brief
vanilla
notes
are
found
if
you
search
the
soured
feel
does
calm
down
a
bit
with
warmth
but
is
consistant
throughout
then
more
noticeable
again
on
the
finish
and
mouthfeel
the
carmalized
malt
shows
itself
again
a
bit
on
the
finish
dont
really
get
any
oak
in
this
one
kind
of
a
let
down
fot
the
style
overall
a
very
solid
beerwould
buy
again
a
lot
of
people
love
this
beer
to
me
and
others
agreed
it
tasted
like
half
guinness
and
half
whiskey
the
guinness
taste
is
of
course
because
its
a
stout
and
the
whiskey
flavor
is
due
to
the
oak
barrel
this
is
great
for
those
who
enjoy
whiskey
but
i
simply
dont
enjoy
that
flavor
so
this
beer
just
isnt
for
me
had
the
privilege
of
sampling
this
beverage
at
happy
hour
in
dc
poured
a
deep
brown
with
red
edges
and
formed
a
light
beige
head
mild
lacing
the
nose
was
chocolate
toffee
coffee
vanilla
toasted
malt
and
light
hops
and
oak
the
flavor
was
primarily
light
cafe
mocha
and
the
finish
was
a
mixture
of
hops
and
toasty
malt
that
sat
very
well
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
lighter
than
i
would
have
liked
but
this
stouts
lighter
body
and
modest
carbonation
made
it
a
very
smooth
drink
that
i
could
enjoy
for
an
extended
period
another
homerun
from
dsigmon
brock
thanks
again
exceptional
and
very
generous
extra
black
with
a
beige
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
a
a
ring
around
the
glass
smell
gives
me
quite
a
bit
of
roast
and
some
cherries
upon
further
agitation
of
the
glass
i
got
a
little
bit
of
a
malted
milk
ball
aroma
really
dont
think
i
picked
out
vanilla
taste
is
a
bit
roasty
at
the
beginning
but
then
i
get
a
much
more
creamy
taste
that
comes
through
again
i
dont
know
that
i
would
have
specifically
picked
out
vanilla
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
used
medium
carbonation
and
body
is
a
little
less
than
medium
thanks
to
dsigmon
for
the
sample
overall
i
expected
more
the
head
completely
dissapeared
12
way
through
and
the
flatness
prevailed
i
didnt
sense
any
of
the
vanilla
in
the
taste
either
which
i
wouldve
liked
i
would
drink
this
again
but
not
back
to
back
ill
pair
one
bottle
with
food
next
time
d
pretty
good
very
tasty
and
balanced
i
could
actually
do
several
of
these
impressive
and
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
very
dark
with
a
darker
tannish
head
nose
is
a
touch
of
wood
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
going
with
it
the
first
hit
of
flavor
gave
cause
for
concern
but
then
it
ended
up
being
not
so
bad
however
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
acidic
and
citric
in
nature
that
makes
it
kind
of
leaning
towards
an
not
so
loved
realm
it
isnt
bad
but
there
is
just
this
edge
that
i
personally
dont
like
and
the
feel
is
a
bit
thin
on
the
liquid
carbonation
is
kind
of
low
too
it
is
nice
to
drink
but
i
dont
really
see
how
an
oak
barrel
has
really
done
anything
for
this
beer
the
beer
poured
a
rich
dark
amber
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
coffee
and
malt
the
taste
carried
this
straight
over
and
was
ver
y
rich
coffee
and
malt
the
feel
was
medium
and
dry
i
found
this
to
be
a
real
nice
bitter
stout
they
did
a
good
job
with
the
hops
so
that
the
bitterness
seemed
to
be
strictly
from
the
coffee
malt
pours
almost
pitch
black
except
for
some
reddish
around
the
edges
when
the
light
hits
a
small
thin
head
of
cocoa
colored
suds
quickly
dissipates
into
a
thin
ring
the
aromas
of
ground
coffee
and
vanilla
mix
well
taste
of
toasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
with
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
finishes
dry
a
surprisingly
thin
body
and
fairly
low
abv
for
this
style
which
also
makes
this
a
good
session
beer
medium
bodied
a
little
thinner
than
expected
very
smooth
easy
drinking
stout
and
just
complex
enough
not
the
best
stout
out
there
but
pretty
solid
a
nice
and
interesting
session
stout
d
good
sipper
this
beer
pours
out
of
the
bottle
like
motor
oil
minimal
head
and
carbonation
pleasant
aroma
of
burnt
oak
chips
and
a
wisp
of
vanilla
taste
is
also
pleasant
with
the
same
oak
chips
and
vanilla
this
is
something
i
would
buy
again
but
i
doubt
i
could
drink
more
than
3
at
one
sitting
d
its
hard
for
me
to
rate
this
too
much
above
average
i
did
enjoy
it
but
not
sure
i
will
rush
out
to
buy
it
again
if
you
were
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
tasting
stout
this
would
serve
fine
d
likable
stout
with
a
few
weaknesses
most
of
which
im
guessing
are
due
to
age
i
have
another
of
these
to
try
however
its
just
a
couple
months
younger
i
like
the
vanilla
and
oak
and
i
like
the
direction
this
beer
is
going
it
makes
for
a
drinkable
stout
with
a
nice
dessertlike
twist
recommended
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
thin
very
drinkable
and
possibly
the
most
drinkable
oaked
beer
ive
ever
come
across
i
enjoyed
it
get
some
old
dominion
oak
stout
on
a
cold
night
and
itll
see
ya
through
d
i
love
stouts
but
this
is
really
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
the
vanilla
flavor
is
nice
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
oak
taste
they
really
compliment
each
other
well
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
classic
dark
black
body
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
head
the
smell
is
wicked
powerful
there
is
a
ton
of
vanilla
and
a
light
malt
presence
imo
the
vanilla
is
too
strong
it
should
complement
the
aroma
not
dominate
it
the
flavor
about
half
as
strong
as
the
aroma
but
the
dominant
flavor
is
sour
there
are
some
dark
malt
flavors
and
an
acidic
aftertaste
the
flavor
is
pretty
thin
and
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
i
was
pretty
excited
about
this
beer
initially
but
it
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
as
is
to
me
it
would
be
even
greater
if
it
were
smoother
and
more
full
this
beer
is
not
much
like
guinness
because
it
lacks
the
strong
burnt
coffee
and
salty
components
of
guinness
which
may
be
a
plus
or
a
minus
depending
on
how
much
you
like
the
irish
icon
oak
barrel
is
a
good
stout
pleasant
and
inoffensive
i
would
enjoy
it
again
though
it
does
not
rank
among
the
leading
american
stouts
in
my
opinion
the
taste
has
all
sorts
of
flavours
going
on
lots
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
and
wood
with
helpings
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
a
slight
citrus
bitterness
in
the
background
and
it
finishes
witha
nice
hot
cocoa
bitter
bite
but
its
smooth
as
all
hell
and
it
doesnt
hurt
that
its
only
5
2abv
it
makes
it
sessionable
as
hell
lol
man
is
this
son
of
a
gun
drinkable
and
velvety
smooth
great
fullish
mouthfeel
and
its
lightly
carbonated
i
like
this
one
a
lot
lots
of
flavour
easy
to
drink
smooth
this
has
it
all
going
on
id
get
this
one
again
no
problem
overall
an
excellent
brew
top
notch
the
abvs
only
5
2
which
would
make
this
a
great
session
beer
for
a
cold
winters
night
highly
recommended
if
you
see
this
around
grab
it
immediately
pours
pure
black
with
a
couple
fingers
of
quickly
fading
head
smells
of
oaky
vanilla
roasted
coffee
beans
and
some
chocolate
tastes
bigger
on
coffee
then
i
thought
it
would
vanilla
and
oak
make
a
presence
but
no
bourbon
which
i
actually
like
finishes
a
little
sweet
and
bitter
like
bakers
chocolate
medium
in
the
mouth
and
outstanding
drikability
it
poured
a
dark
handsome
shade
of
black
it
had
a
slight
malty
aroma
nothing
over
powering
its
a
dark
beer
but
not
too
heavy
and
what
sets
it
apart
for
me
is
that
vanilla
mouth
feel
and
after
taste
the
drinkabilty
is
through
the
roof
if
this
were
any
higher
in
abv
it
could
be
really
dangerous
damn
i
could
use
another
very
nice
beer
when
you
want
a
stout
with
a
little
extra
something
it
pours
with
a
nice
foamy
head
it
has
a
nice
dark
appearance
it
has
a
wonderful
smell
a
strong
coffee
scent
with
definite
hints
of
vanilla
goes
down
nice
and
has
an
excellent
additional
oaky
flavor
you
can
definitely
tell
the
beer
has
had
some
contact
with
bourbon
oak
barrels
while
its
not
my
favorite
its
definitely
a
distinct
stout
with
a
great
taste
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
stout
that
is
a
bit
unique
in
the
flavor
profile
with
alcohol
level
at
5
abv
this
is
a
nice
session
stout
for
me
thanks
to
nacir69
for
this
one
pours
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
of
about
12
a
finger
disappointing
head
smells
of
coffee
with
a
nice
woodsy
aftertaste
tastes
like
sweetened
coffee
alcohol
completely
undetectable
in
the
flavor
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
dry
clean
and
refreshed
not
too
thick
but
not
watery
just
about
right
in
texture
has
a
distinct
bitterness
that
is
strong
but
in
a
very
pleasant
way
probably
offset
by
the
sweetness
much
easier
to
drink
than
most
stouts
partly
because
the
mouthfeel
isnt
as
coating
and
the
fact
that
it
is
not
as
heavy
goes
down
smooth
pours
a
solid
black
color
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
subtle
oak
and
vanilla
are
in
the
air
in
the
taste
chocolate
and
somewhat
like
mocha
an
aftertaste
that
is
a
bit
dry
and
leaves
a
coffee
presence
in
the
mouth
a
lighter
body
than
most
stouts
a
nice
flavorful
stout
i
enjoyed
the
coffeemocha
vanilla
flavor
for
dessert
pretty
drinkable
but
could
be
more
complex
and
rely
on
the
oak
less
hmm
i
hope
i
didnt
get
a
bad
bottle
ill
look
for
it
again
and
give
it
another
try
despite
its
weight
this
beer
is
delicious
enough
to
have
a
few
alright
i
had
some
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
it
did
not
really
pan
out
as
i
had
hoped
pour
was
uneventful
thick
black
oil
like
with
no
real
head
decent
lacing
throughout
smell
was
very
full
lots
of
oak
and
bourbon
aromas
and
the
vanilla
is
unmistakable
in
fact
pretty
much
over
powering
first
impression
was
not
pleasant
it
was
vanilla
overload
for
me
nad
what
the
vanilla
didnt
kill
the
oak
took
care
of
later
not
enough
carbonation
left
it
feeling
utterly
flat
and
uneventful
really
had
a
rough
time
getting
all
of
this
down
as
the
vanilla
and
oak
were
just
overdone
and
killing
it
for
me
overall
nah
i
am
good
i
normally
like
oak
aged
beers
but
this
was
overdone
for
sure
and
just
not
that
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
stout
but
the
drinkability
is
pretty
darn
good
since
this
brewery
seems
to
be
affiliated
with
ab
now
didnt
know
until
i
came
to
review
it
maybe
i
can
find
it
again
easily
would
love
a
case
of
this
for
the
fallwinter
thanks
jnn4v
this
is
just
a
solid
across
the
board
brew
it
hits
you
with
good
flavour
and
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
having
a
barrel
aged
brew
that
does
not
smack
you
in
the
head
with
a
strong
bourbon
presence
was
a
nice
touch
as
well
and
one
id
like
to
see
more
of
from
other
breweries
as
it
provides
for
a
bit
more
complexity
without
being
overpowering
and
still
remaining
fairly
straightforward
good
stuff
overall
overall
this
selection
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
smooth
and
a
slightly
creamy
but
bit
light
and
mild
for
my
taste
in
stouts
a
solid
beer
d
good
for
a
stout
very
mild
but
flavorful
gifted
to
me
by
shivtim
who
liked
this
so
much
on
tap
that
he
brought
me
a
bottle
back
from
d
c
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
little
head
which
is
more
of
a
thin
little
ring
of
bubbles
than
anything
kind
of
unexcitinglooking
esp
considering
the
name
odor
is
strongly
of
chocolate
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
bourbon
also
some
toasty
notes
the
vanilla
odor
worries
me
and
for
the
first
time
i
notice
that
this
is
aged
with
vanilla
beans
taste
is
heavy
on
the
vanilla
up
front
with
a
transition
to
a
toasty
roated
malt
and
chocolate
alcohol
is
present
in
a
slumbering
bourbon
quality
and
the
vanilla
is
a
beany
icecream
vanilla
rather
than
a
a
fake
vanilla
flavoring
one
still
like
a
lot
of
vanillatinged
beers
its
very
freaking
distracting
and
i
wish
it
wasnt
there
so
i
could
just
concentrate
on
the
bourbon
and
stout
parts
of
the
beer
also
a
little
watery
for
the
style
but
well
balanced
not
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
but
im
sure
its
better
on
tap
thanks
paul
served
up
on
tap
came
cascading
beautiful
its
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
giant
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
into
place
the
nose
is
sweet
toasted
malts
and
creamy
coffee
taste
is
smoky
malts
with
hints
of
earthy
fruits
and
sweet
white
vanilla
frosting
on
the
end
mouthfeel
is
good
and
full
drinkability
is
up
there
great
brew
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
actually
one
that
i
enjoy
drinking
in
the
warmer
months
when
my
thrist
for
stouts
typically
declines
much
more
complex
and
balanced
than
some
of
the
highly
hyped
imperial
stouts
and
certainly
sessionable
seek
this
one
out
d
very
complex
for
a
smaller
stout
very
well
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
recommended
i
was
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
the
vanilla
sweetness
up
front
lingered
and
dominated
the
flavor
too
much
its
a
nice
attempt
at
a
relatively
low
abv
beer
with
alot
of
taste
poured
out
a
near
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
nothing
the
nose
offered
strong
malt
notes
accompanied
by
light
smoke
bbq
hickory
and
mollasses
the
taste
had
some
nice
malt
smoke
mollasses
and
maple
syrup
flavors
but
everything
fell
a
bit
short
has
a
very
light
body
and
clean
finish
more
reminiscent
of
a
porter
than
a
stout
and
not
satisfying
at
all
granted
this
is
a
beer
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
without
getting
sick
something
most
aoked
beers
cant
claim
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
starts
off
with
promise
and
then
falls
flat
d
highly
sessionable
stout
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
beer
that
i
had
in
ireland
beamish
a
lot
of
complexity
goes
into
each
different
flavor
aspect
and
truly
rounds
together
for
an
outstanding
stout
experience
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
with
a
great
character
good
beverage
not
really
a
standout
for
me
a
pretty
flavorful
vanilla
stout
it
is
drinkable
but
would
not
be
my
choice
d
i
can
do
a
bunch
of
these
the
flavors
meld
together
well
and
one
doesnt
overpower
the
other
the
lighter
abv
allows
you
to
have
a
few
could
use
a
bit
more
oak
flavor
but
id
still
go
for
this
one
again
recommended
poured
a
mostly
opaque
black
with
some
brown
showing
aroune
the
edges
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
smell
is
mostly
lightly
scented
with
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
grain
the
flavor
is
very
smooth
and
light
with
some
light
roastiness
and
detectable
vanilla
but
not
a
lot
more
going
on
very
very
smooth
mouthfeel
you
could
just
suck
this
down
like
a
glass
of
milk
not
the
most
interesting
stout
in
the
world
but
refreshing
for
the
style
call
it
an
odd
experiment
but
every
once
in
a
while
something
wierd
like
this
actually
pays
off
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
thin
for
the
style
you
could
do
much
worse
but
i
had
such
high
expectations
for
this
being
a
stout
and
having
had
oak
chips
and
vanilla
beans
marinating
in
it
ill
definitely
drink
the
other
five
but
i
wont
be
rushing
out
to
spen
another
799
on
another
six
d
even
though
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
awful
somehow
this
beer
remains
drinkable
as
long
as
you
are
drinking
it
the
gumminess
doesnt
bother
you
or
the
slightly
drying
aspect
the
flavor
itself
is
complex
and
devoid
of
sweetness
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
might
have
it
again
cheers

this
stout
is
quite
different

others
ive

so

this
ones
a
quaffer
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
with
a
chocolate
desert
would
be
nice
to
be
able
to
get
something
like
this
for
happy
hour
one
of
the
more
impressive
stouts
ive
had
in
a
while
which
admittedly
isnt
many
i
dont
really
get
a
lot
of
of
the
oak
character
but
its
tasty
all
gimmicks
aside
drinkability
good
thanks
for
the
chance
muenchenerkindl
to
preface
this
accordingly
i
must
say
that
im
a
fan
of
the
old
dominion
brews
i
live
in
washington
dc
and
visit
the
brewery
once
every
23
months
for
sixtels
and
pony
kegs
their
beers
are
good
not
great
and
the
customer
service
at
their
brewpup
is
subpar
most
of
the
waitstaff
is
clueless
and
the
bartenders
appear
to
be
idiots
but
i
like
what
they
do
so
i
keep
going
back
the
oak
barrel
stout
pours
a
deep
rich
reddish
black
with
a
thin
head
not
much
foam
or
lace
to
speak
of
but
the
aroma
is
what
captures
you
strong
vanilla
scent
with
some
chocolate
some
caramel
and
a
woody
overtone
the
taste
is
just
as
nice
with
the
vanilla
present
again
as
well
as
some
bitter
coffee
and
a
hint
of
citrus
in
the
finish
which
is
unusual
for
a
stout
of
this
nature
but
present
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
weak
overall
i
like
the
oak
barrel
mostly
because
it
presents
a
formidable
opponent
to
some
lesser
stouts
out
there
the
problem
is
that
you
cant
find
it
everywhere
so
youre
stuck
drinking
inferior
stouts
until
old
dominion
can
get
distribution
widerspread
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
like
drinking
a
nitrogenated
beer
light
and
airee
feelinggoes
down
nice
and
easy
just
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
drink
all
night
long
a
beer
thats
worth
a
try
bigger
would
be
better
i
have
had
this
beer
several
times
in
the
bottle
and
on
tap
and
never
know
what
to
expect
sometimes
great
and
sometimes
disappointing
this
was
a
great
bottle
bottled

the
pour
into

nonic
raises
a
very
thin
dark
tan
glass
ring
over

is
minimal
nothing
impressive
here
the
nose
is
where
the
fun
begins
definite
oak
vanilla
and
chocolate
coming
through
not
very
intense
but
lovely
the
taste
is
fairly
dry
throughout
but
has
a
very
strong
caramelvanilla
presence
which
is
more
potent
than
the
traditional
stout
flavors
which
hide
in
the
background
it
has
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
is
essentially
the
same
no
complaints
this
beer
has
quite
the
thick
consistency
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
for
a
stout
i
guess
that
helps
to
lighten
it
up
a
little
i
will
definitely
reach
for
this
beer
the
next
time
i
can
get
some
a
nice

stout

and
a
great

beer
for
the

overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
i
however
was
expecting
a
bit
more
of
a
filling
beer
not
to
say
it
wasnt
good
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
one
for
the
ages
i
am
blown
away
d
very
tasty
very
easytodrink
slightly
filling
this
is
a
good
beer
to
sit
and
relax
with
received
in
a
recent
trade
from

nriech
bottled
on

2006
pours
a
deeply
dark
chocolate
brown
almost
black
with
a
rather
thin
light
mocha
head
roasty
black
malt
aromas
mix
with
a
faint
vanilla
sweetness
some
coffee
undertones
and
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
appear
as
well
but
overall
the
nose
is
surprisingly
restrained
since
this
is
served
at
just
about
cellar
temperature
and
no
colder
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
good
or
bad
thing
meaning
its
not
overpoweringly
vanillascented
but
im
not
all
that
excited
by
the
nose
either
okay
the
taste
helps
me
decide
the
nose
is
good
regarding
the
flavor
the
vanilla
sweetness
and
the
roasted
malt
characteristics
mentioned
above
really
come
forward
in
the
taste
but
not
too
forcefully
in
either
respect
they
are
quite
well
balanced
in
fact
a
dry
oakiness
is
also
present
in
the
taste
lingering
for
a
while
afterwards
lending
a
vinous
aspect
to
the
finish
slight
carbonation
a
bit
slippery
in
the
mouthfeel
leaning
towards
a
velvet
smoothness
medium
body
not
the
dryest
stout
in
the
world
i
like
mine
to
be
pretty
heavy
on
the
roasty
side
of
things
and
the
vanilla
beans
prevent
that
from
really
taking
over
in
this
beer
but
its
got
a
very
compelling
flavor
profile
nevertheless
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
someday
as
i
get
the
feeling
it
might
be
a
little
more
exciting
that
way
easily
sessionable
as
long
as
you
dont
mind
a
slight
persistent
vanilla
flavor
in
stouts
d
goes
down
very
easy
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
d
one
of
the
only
stouts
i
could
describe
as
light
and
refreshing
you
could
easily
drink
this
in
summerin
fact
better
than
in
winter
not
so
much
stout
as
slightly
husky
this
beer
pours
a
dark
black
with
hints
of
red
lace
with
a
smallish
tan
head
that
disspates
to
just
some
whisps
of
foam
with
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
wood
the
taste
is
up
front
with
the
roasted
and
black
malts
again
the
vanilla
and
wood
make
a
lingering
presence
here
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
but
not
bad
on
carbonation
overall
a
good
stout
but
not
one
i
was
so
thrilled
with
id
like
to
get
over
and
over
again
overall
a
delicious
brew
that
exhibits
a
complex
flavor
profile
nicely
done
carbonation
if
the
appearance
were
a
little
better
this
one
would
be
tops
the
flavor
is
top
notch
nonetheless
definately
worth
a
try
and
at
the
abv
a
few
can
be
had
the
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
finger
of
tan
soda
like
head
the
nose
was
dark
malts
and
strong
vanilla
tones
a
very
nice
aroma
on
this
beer
the
flavor
of
a
distinct
mellow
dark
maltiness
to
start
that
mellowed
into
a
vanilla
and
then
lightly
oaky
flavor
after
the
swallow
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
but
incredibly
drinkable
and
a
stout
that
i
wish
were
available
here
in
jacksonville
overall
thanks
go
out
to
himerman
for
this
great
beer
thank
you
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
try
this
beer
thanks
also
for
a
great
trade
poured
to
a
typical
stout
opaqueblack
with
thick
tan
head
that
lingers
and
then
leaves
good
lacing
i
couldnt
detect
much
aroma
but
the
flavor
was
a
tasty
mix
of
vanilla
with
a
hint
of
malty
chocolate
finish
was
very
smooth
yet
not
too
sweet
i
generally
dont
consider
stouts
for
session
beers
but
could
actually
see
drinking
several
of
these
over
a
few
hours
a
darn
good
beer
pours
a
nearly
opaque
blackbrown
with
just
a
hint
of
light
penetrating
the
edges
thin
head
of
small
brown
bubbles
aroma
is
mostly
coffee
just
a
hint
bourbon
and
vanilla
taste
is
dominated
by
vanilla
maybe
just
a
bit
too
much
i
dont
get
any
coffee
in
the
taste
just
vanilla
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
just
a
dash
of
bourbon
the
dash
of
bourbon
is
perfect
in
my
opinion
not
overdone
just
an
accent
creamy
texture
aftertaste
long
and
mild
burnt
grains
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
impressive
this
is
one
case
where
the
bottled
version
wins
out
i
have
had
this
on
draft
before
and
i
dont
recall
it
being
as
complex
and
creamy
grade
a
stout
one
i
will
keep
in
rotation
in
the
coming
months
cheers
this
is
truly
a
great
one
i
love
all
stouts
most
have
a
coffee
like
finish
as
a
result
of
the
roasted
malts
but
this
is
an
exceptionally
smooth
beer
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
my
only
regret
is
that
i
live
1200
miles
away
from
the
source
cheers
very
drinkable
brew
that
id
highly
recommend
d
not
bad
but
the
flavors
seemed
a
little
fake
its
very
obvious
that
this
isnt
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
but
oak
chips
and
vanilla
beans
are
used
certainly
drinkable
but
not
stellar
this
was
interesting
to
say
the
least
the
beer
really
picked
up
the
wood
flavors
almost
to
the
point
of
overkill
again
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
its
not
something
id
want
to
order
over
and
over
either
good
for
what
it
is
and
worth
at
least
a
shot
i
had
this
brew
from
a
nitrotap
wile
traveling
in
arlingtonva
its
an
incredibly
black
liquid
with
a
unremarkable
nitroinduced
head
the
aroma
is
of
highly
roasted
barley
mingled
with
a
subtler
smoke
quality
theres
also
a
bit
of
chocolate
wood
and
malt
in
the
smell
id
expected
the
aromas
to
be
a
little
more
intense
but
their
somewhat
faint
the
taste
has
an
initial
modest
sweetness
but
quickly
dries
out
in
the
midtaste
nice
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
medium
fullness
and
very
smooth
nitrogen
body
make
this
very
drinkable
all
in
all
this
ones
not
bad
this
is
an
interesting
treat
of
a
stout
not
much
head
when
i
poured
it
what
was
there
quickly
turned
to
caramel
lace
over
a
typical
dark
stoutblack
brew
no
matter
the
beer
held
a
strong
aroma
throughout
the
drink
at
room
temperature
it
is
fantastic
forget
the
black
forest
cake
this
beer
is
dessert
in
itself
while
not
especially
assertive
at
least
initially
it
is
still
a
very
enjoyable
classy
stout
the
smokiness
is
kept
tame
but
capable
and
thats
a
pleasing
touch
in
my
mind
as
it
rounds
out
the
flavor
is
full
and
crisp
in
its
way
the
manageable
abv
and
rather
refreshing
nature
make
this
nicely
drinkable
with
multiple
indulgences
virtually
guaranteed
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
and
now
im
looking
forward
to
my
next
opportunity
for
a
stout
incredibly
drinkable
not
too
thick
and
the
flavour
is
so
incredibly
enjoyable
i
always
find
myself
reaching
for
another
lower
the
carbonation
levels
and
this
would
easily
be
a
5
for
me
all
in
all
a
fantastic
beer
beautiful
roasted
burnt
aroma
and
black
as
night
with
slight
browning
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
light
glides
down
your
throat
like
soft
silk
temping
you
with
flavors
of
vanilla
oak
and
dark
malt
this
beer
is
sweet
like
dark
chocolate
and
complex
enough
to
sit
and
savor
but
not
overly
so
good
stuff
old
dominion
a
coffee
component
comes
into
play
in
the
taste
like
a
latte
heavy
cream
choclate
covered
cherry
good
wood
integration
and
a
finish
of
at
least
45
seconds
drinkable
as
hell
if
not
a
tad
to
sweet
i
felt
this
was
an
ok
blended
stout
not
the
best
and
certainly
not
the
worst
this
a
very
light
and
easy
beer
for
the
style
with
a
just
a
fantastic
smokeoak
blend
one
of
my
favorite
beers
appearance
like
most
dry
stouts
but
then
the
aromas
of
vanilla
and
rum
the
creamy
mouthfeel
nitro
and
flavors
of
dry
roast
layered
with
vanilla
and
that
rummy
sweet
bourbon
note
befuddle
my
brain
and
i
become
silent
secretly
hating
everyone
else
in
the
room
that
doesnt
have
one
in
front
of
them
the
bottled
and
keg
version
for
sale
outside
the
brewery
is
purely
criminal
no
good
the
taste
was
much
of
the
same
with
a
great
complexity
and
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
tastes
chocolate
and
sweet
cream
the
motufeel
was
very
good
as
well
a
sweetness
and
creamy
smoothness
balanced
by
alcohol
and
mild
bitterness
wonderful
and
wonderfully
drinkable
too
hats
off
to
old
dominion
oh
sorry
as
i
was
saying
this
beer
is
with
no
real
its
drinkable
and
i
like
it
mk
this
stout
had
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
dissipated
quickly
it
had
a
medium
malt
aroma
with
the
slightest
hint
of
vanilla
in
it
the
taste
was
wellbalanced
with
a
medium
body
for
a
stout
and
a
medium
hop
bitterness
that
wasnt
too
strong
but
seemed
just
right
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumthick
with
mediumlow
carbonation
i
felt
that
for
a
stout
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
it
went
down
easy
i
would
gladly
have
another
and
i
feel
this
was
an
allaround
good
beer
highly
recommended
drinkability
notes
although
the
bourbon
aftertaste
makes
you
think
it
have
a
higher
abv
level
it
doesnt
no
more
or
less
drinkable
than
most
stouts
ive
had
and
yet
it
is
a
great
light
stout
the
bourbon
and
vanilla
are
at
a
perfect
level
not
at
all
overwhelming
but
supplement
the
other
stout
flavours
well
great
smell
with
some
unique
linguiring
flavours
interesting
brew
in
that
it
has
the
complex
mix
of
flavors
of
a
big
beer
but
isnt
pours
with
a
syrupy
smell
of
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
maple
when
in
the
glass
theres
a
brown
spongy
head
over
a
ruby
to
black
body
taste
is
of
a
dry
stout
but
well
mellowed
with
a
trace
of
smoke
and
coffee
vanilla
is
in
just
the
right
proportion
to
be
a
part
of
the
beer
instead
of
making
it
a
flavored
beer
if
you
get
my
meaning
very
light
oakiness
helps
smooth
out
the
brew
too
12
oz
bottled
on
2906
fermented
with
vanilla
beans
and
oak
chips
i
served
this
one
in
a
chalice
it
pours
black
with
dark
brown
tinges
on
the
edges
and
a
thin
espresso
head
of
medium
bubbles
leaving
some
spots
of
lace
it
smells
very
roasted
with
tobacco
juice
chocolate
lots
of
floralspicy
almost
citric
hops
and
a
big
vanilla
profile
that
mixes
well
into
the
bouquet
there
are
flavors
of
oak
and
vanilla
right
away
with
chocolate
roasted
malts
tobacco
charred
wood
and
some
dark
fruit
notes
delicious
it
has
a
medium
to
thick
body
that
leaves
a
long
finish
and
drinks
very
easily
a
damn
fine
stout
overall
a
very
drinkable
stout
with
some
interesting
flavors
that
make
this
a
worthwhile
try
mouthfeel
is
substantial
silky
and
fairly
thick
drinkability
is
good
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
tan
head
rich
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
fudge
coffee
and
chocolate
brownies
light
aromatic
hops
hints
of
vanilla
and
a
light
hint
of
oak
pretty
subtle
and
gentle
overall
with
a
roasted
coffee
vanilla
bean
chocolate
hops
and
a
light
hint
of
toasted
oak
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
not
sure
if
this
bottle
is
touched
or
what
but
this
is
not
a
complex
or
exceptional
on
the
taste
end
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
have
just
sat
and
smelled
and
smelled
and
smelled
it
poured
a
beautiful
black
chocolate
with
a
thin
white
not
tan
head
taking
a
whiff
of
the
beer
was
like
waking
up
after
camping
to
the
smell
of
rainsoaked
charred
oak
campfire
logsit
was
a
subdued
smokeyoaky
scent
it
was
heavenly
in
comparison
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
were
thin
and
a
bit
of
a
letdown
i
could
taste
the
classic
stout
malts
that
resemble
the
acidic
bitterness
in
coffee
but
there
was
not
much
more
there
nevertheless
the
aroma
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
very
creamy
and
overall
a
great
beer
i
had
this
as
part
of
the
beer
of
the
month
a
while
back
and
then
again
at
eulogy
in
philadelphia
pa
pours
nice
and
smells
great
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
in
nj
or
pa
to
pick
up
a
case
the
vanilla
finish
is
great
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
on
the
menu
at
summits
in
sandy
springs
personally
i
really
love
the
oakbourbon
style
of
stouts
the
aroma
was
very
oaky
but
not
overpowering
thhis
was
very
easy
to
drink
very
creamy
with
minimal
carbonation
i
hope
that
i
can
find
some
of
this
in
a
bottle
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
on
a
cold
winter
day
appeared
an
opaque
viscous
black
color
with
a
soft
tan
colored
head
that
didnt
remain
but
left
behind
some
nice
lacing
aromas
of
wood
alcohol
vanilla
and
roasted
sugar
seemed
to
come
out
very
nicely
the
taste
was
just
an
explosion
of
sweetness
with
a
roastedsmoky
character
upfront
and
a
honey
vanilla
finish
the
flavors
of
this
beer
ontap
are
much
more
prominent
and
aggressive
than
in
the
bottled
verison
which
is
much
much
more
subtle
and
gentle
the
dominating
flavors
work
very
well
together
and
generate
a
lingering
sweetness
that
feels
more
like
root
beer
or
an
ice
cream
float
than
a
stout
i
felt
my
tongue
coated
after
every
sip
with
an
almost
breadychewy
texture
so
rich
and
so
smooth
i
could
have
this
all
day
though
eventually
the
sweetness
might
rot
my
teeth

not

not

just
different
pleasant
and
tasty
stout
with
a
very
moderate
alcohol
level
as
close
to
a
session
beer
as
stouts
ever
really
get
very
dark
brown
with
a
short
medium

head
quickly
reduced
to

left

of

in
the

mild

same

in
the
flavour
but
with
chocolate
in

slightly
acidic
with
muted
cherry
and
weak
vanilla
theres
a
bit
of
woodiness
in
the
finish
soft
carbonation
and
silky
texture
with
some
lingering
dryness
medium
bodied
solid
beer
but
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
from
the
advertised
vanilla
and
oak
thanks
northyorksammy
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
character
with
a
good
quality
stout
that
is
enhanced
by
the
wood
and
vanilla
they
are
not
to
strong
and
not
to
soft
very
nice
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
but
the
carbonation
is
where
i
enjoy
it
and
it
is
easily
consumed
with
a
fairly
low
abv
for
me
would
love
to
try
this
one
on
cask
as
the
oak
age
flavors
are
nice
but
would
really
shine
as
a
real
ale
imo
overall
it
was
hard
to
score
this
stout
because
the
middle
scores
imply
average
which
this
wasnt
but
the
rummy
oak
flavor
kind
of
clobbered
everything
else
this
beer
is
very
cellarable

on

much

from

this
up
at

for

650ml

a
very
dark
black
with
a

roasted

tastes
pretty
good
picking
up
notes
of

thin

not
the
best
chocolate

but
for
2

im
not
disappointed
i
paid
2

for
a
bomber
of
this
at
trader

i
figured
it
was
a
great
deal
now
i
realize
i
overpaid
long

short
inoffensive

cheap

beverage
not

a

mine
was
brewed
by
rhinelander
the
coffee
was
very
prominent
with
a
very
smooth
roasty
bitterness
behind
it
i
actually
enjoyed
this
deep
chocolate
brown
with
decent

and
ok
lacing
smell
is
of
a
bit
of
chocolate
taste
has
a
touch
of
chocolate
but
the
malt
presence
is
way
too
high
and
renders
this
beer
to
the
bottom
of
its
style
not
bad
would
happily
drink
anytime
good
enough
value
for
me
to
not
regret
buying
a

despite
it
being
a
waterycarbonated
stout
rather
than
a
creamydense
one
like
i
usually
prefer
there
seems
to
be
some
debate
here
about
how
chocolatey
it
is
i
found
it
to
be
delightfully
less
chocolatey
than
the
overt
claims
on
the
label
might
imply
overall
this
was
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
but
nothing
outstanding
there
was
something
that
tasted
off
but
i
couldnt
pinpoint
that
thing
glad
i
tried
it
but
its
far
from
the
best
in
a
crowded
market
looks
good
but
taste
and
aroma
are
quite
lacking
and
without
a
payoff
kick
its
not
so
stout
notes
distinctly
chocolatey
with
a
decisive
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
character
some
fruit
and
roasted
character
appears
as
well
both
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
the
grassy
and
leafy
hops
as
might
be
expected
for
the
style
are
relegated
to
a
background
role
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
carbonation
level
that
leaves
it
with
a
delicate
caress
before
smoothly
passing
balanced
pleasant
but
still
somehow
lacking
wow
very
nice
very
chocolatey
very
underrated
i
think
im
not
afraid
to
call
it
what
it
is
a
trader
joes
special
okay
but
its
pretty
darned
good
low
abv
but
that
transfers
to
taste
hopefully
i
do
not
understand
the
75
rating
maybe
because
it
is
trader
joes
stuff
but
this
is
pretty
good
in
my
opinion
on
a
neutral
evening
and
with
unbiased
taste
buds
i
tasted
quite
a
bit
more
chocolate
than
many
of
the
reviewers
here
but
generally
concur
that
it
falls
short
of
what
a
chocolate
stout
can
be
for
the
price
not
bad
at
all
but
quite
a
few
other
comparablypriced
trader
joes
offerings
surpass
it
not
enough
chocolate
not
enough
black
patent
malt
but
not
bad
by
any
stretch
bought
from
trader
joes
in
raleigh
nc
supposed
to
be
chocolate
stout
but
minimal
chocolate
flavor
not
very
good
wont
be
trying
again
overall
it
is
unfortunate
but
this
doesnt
seem
like
a
super
high
quality
beer
its
not
horrible
or
anything
but
a
chocolate
stout
can
be
so
much
more
than
this
overall
a
good
brew
for
the
cost

with
three
fingers
of
a
foamy
khaki
head
smells
of
malt
hints
of
metal
and
a
corny
lager
smell
overall
not
too
appealing
on
the
nose
it
tastes
of
malt
hints
of
roast
or
smokiness
with
a
strong
chocolate
finishing
taste
medium
carbonation
medium
bodied
with
a
crispy
carbonation
feel
overall
its
nothing
exceptional
and
the
best
thing
it
has
going
for
it
is
its
appearance
poured
into
my
frozen
beer
mug
the
one
thing
this
brew
has
going
for
it
is
the
appearance
rich
creamy
brown
foam
with
small
to
medium
lacing
so
dark
when
i
held
it
up
to
the
afternoon
sun
you
still
cant
see
through
it
however
this
one
proves
the
saying
you
get
what
you
pay
for
yes
it
is
definitely
a
stout
it
just
lacks
depth
and
has
a
certain
watery
body
to
it
couldnt
taste
any
chocolate
personally
a
bit
of
creaminess
with
a
slightly
hoppy
aftertaste
its
drinkable
but
i
wont
be
looking
out
for
this
one
next
time
im
in
the
store
overall
nothing
special
much
cheaper
than
a
chocolate
stout
from
rogue
but
not
nearly
as
enjoyable
o
gave
it
a
chance
but
it
wasnt
happening
the
chocolate
fades
fast
and
you
are
left
with
smokeash
o
looks
good
smells
decent
from
the
bottle
not
a
fan
of
the
flavor
as
it
gets
bunched
up
into
nothing
was
really
hard
for
me
to
pick
out
the
flavors
that
i
smelled
glad
i
did
not
pay
much
for
this
one
wont
be
getting
it
again
o
nothing
that
stands
out

flavor

feel

poured
from
a
22

bottle
into

o

from

overall
a
decent
chocolate
stout
definitely
not
horrible
with
some
great
characteristics
though
not
a
comprehensive
package
certainly
unique
and
appreciable
for
its
good
appearance
and
vibrant
chocolate
taste
but
still
quite
a
distance
from
perfection
i
am
picking
up
some
chocolate
malts
and
a
slightly
bitter
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
but
the
beer
really
feels
like
someone
sprinkled
some
nestle
cocoa
mix
into
the
beer
that
cocoa
powder
they
boast
about
on
the
label
tends
to
become
its
downfall

with

chocolate
overall
a
pretty
decent

i
like
that
its
not

heavy

still
has
some
nice

it

are
ok
but
the
palate
is
weak
still
a
pretty
tasty
brew
which
i
would
buy
again
on
nitrotap
at
bernies
in
waukesha
wi
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
creamy
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
rich
with
coffee
the
taste
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
robust
flavors
but
not
too
heavy
has
a
smooth
maltly
flavor
that
is
wellbalanced
nice
find
on
nitro
great
beer
not
necessarily
an
easy
beer
but
definitely
not
pretentious
great
nose
of
roasted
grains
and
black
coffee
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
expected
but
it
worked
this
is
a
great
choice
for
the
stout
fan
or
coffee
lover
not
a
quaffer
but
not
a
one
pint
princes
overall
better
than
average
for
the
style
an
overall
good
choice
pours
a
rich
creamy
looking
black
with
a
large
creamy
deeptan
head
very
good
lacing
very
good
legs
thick
wisps
on
the
surface
and
medium
collar
aroma
and
taste
are
of
very
deep
malt
burnt
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
full
body
and
low
carbonation
lend
to
a
great
thick
rich
mouthfeel
and
completely
satisfying
drinking
experience
best
beer
brewed
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
highly
recommended
id
also
lump
this
one
in
as
being
just
for
beer
geeks
its
too
dark
and
roasty
to
be
used
as
a
gateway
beer
and
its
aggressive
carbiantion
would
not
be
helpful
either
even
for
a
coffee
loving
beergeek
initiate
im
not
seeing
this
one
working
as
their
first
coffee
beer
would
i
buy
it
again
absolutely
its
coffee
with
a
dark
malt
backing
i
was
very
disappointed
in
this
one
i
love
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
so
i
should
i
like
this
but
found
myself
wanting
more
there
are
much
better
performers
in
the
coffee
stout
arena
i
recommend
reaching
for
those
first
o
hinterlands
luna
coffee
stout
makes
a
good
first
impression
with
its
aromatic
scent
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
but
its
overuse
is
too
much
for
such
a
small
light
beer
overwhelming
in
flavor
with
little
body
or
sweetness
to
compensate
for
the
acrid
bitterness
what
id
love
to
see
in
luna
is
less
roasted
malt
and
more
bodybuilding
sweetness
adding
specialty
maltiness
such
as
caramel
it
could
add
really
nice
balance
and
body
without
adding
too
much
alcohol
i
did
not
have
the
proper
glassware
for
this
stout
all
i
had
was
a
shaker
pint
with
that
said
a
very
dark
brown
to
black
color
a
nice
tall
tan
head
that
i
lost
about
halfway
through
great
lacing
to
the
end
smells
obviously
of
coffee
dark
roast
coffee
meets
chocolate
not
as
smooth
as
i
was
anticipating
almost
lighter
feeling
than
expected
very
good
stout
was
not
disappointed
o
a
solid
stout
for
the
price
not
the
most
complex
beer
for
the
style
but
still
a
flavorful
brew
o
the
coffee
flavor
is
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
its
one
of
the
poorer
stouts
that
i
have
tried
d
not
bad
it
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
the
coffee
character
is
pleasant
especially
in
the
aroma
though
it
is
a
bit
on
the
generic
side
overall
a
mild
drinkable
if
unremarkable
coffee
beer
this
was
a
decent
stout
but
not
quite
what
i
expected
somewhat
watery
but
great
aroma
there
are
much
better
values
out
there
a
disappointment
from
green
bay
brewery
compared
to
their
ipa
and
saison
luna
is
a
great
bitter
coffee
stout
that
pours
out
a
deep
brown
aroma
and
taste
are
both
coffee
coffee
coffee
hinterland
is
new
to
my
area
and
i
know
freshness
matters
on
a
coffee
stout
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
its
seriously
got
an
amazing
fresh
coffee
taste
with
a
touch
of
hops
on
the
finish
highly
recommended
the
beer
as
a
stout
in
itself
is
pretty
solid
consistent
flavor
though
its
a
bit
thin
and
could
have
a
heavier
body
the
coffee
tones
are
minimal
on
the
front
i
get
a
push
from
earthy
grinds
it
seems
but
there
is
little
influence
showing
after
the
first
second
or
two
as
a
stout
this
is
nice
enough
but
as
a
coffee
stout
itd
be
nice
to
get
a
bit
more
off
of
the
coffee
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
dark
black
some
foam
mostly
settles
but
light
layer
remains
rich
malty
nose
nutty
with
just
a
hint
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
too
the
taste
is
much
more
coffee
than
not
full
throughout
roasted
bitter
close
smooth
mouthfeel
need
a
little
more
balance
not
much
else
to
say
loads
of
coffee
with
enough
other
flavors
going
on
to
make
it
interesting
id
do
this
again
overall
elements
of
this
beer
are
excellent
but
the
taste
is
really
not
great
and
it
really
takes
away
from
the
good
elements
16
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
head
retention
is
decent
and
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
coffee
roasted
malt
and
some
bittersweet
chocolate
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
its
all
coffee
roasted
malt
and
bittersweet
chocolate
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
and
a
nice
coffee
stout
ive
been
waiting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
now
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
im
a
fan
of
hinterlands
16

bottles
too
9

a
4pack
final
thoughts
be
ready
for
a
lot
of
coffee
flavor
and
just
enough
malt
to
back
it
up
its
a
little
onedimentional
but
that
seems
to
be
true
of
most
american
stouts
would
i
drink
it
again
probably
not
there
are
too
many
other
stouts
i
have
yet
to
try
before
cycling
back
to
this
one
overall
an
enjoyable
beverage
which
effectively
combines
both
coffee
and
malt
easily
drinkable
could
probably
have
more
than
one
a
good
beverage
for
those
who
appreciate
both
beer
and
coffee
o
not
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
by
any
means
a
solid
coffee
flavor
and
a
pretty
easy
drinker
basic
beer
and
it
tastes
nice
o
the
lighterbodied
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
easy
to
drink
although
it
feels
like
a
heavier
body
would
make
the
flavors
stand
out
a
little
more
16oz
bottle
pours
black
with
a
huge
creamy
beige
head
excellent
retention
and
lacing
aromas
are
roasted
barley
coffee
chocolate
tastes
are
coffee
roasted
barley
chocolate
oats
and
somewhat
nutty
mouthfeel
is
creamy
medium
bodied
slightly
chalky
finishes
roasty
overall
good
example
of
a
coffee
stout
and
better
than
expected
o
if
your
a
lover
of
beer
and
coffee
this
is
a
pretty
good
marriage
of
the
two
its
definitely
not
in
the
same
class
as
fbs
but
it
has
good
drinkability
glad
to
recommend
this
nitro
tap
version
is
better
than
the
bottle
but
not
by
much
o
overall
a
solid
brew
here
real
disappointing
nose
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
make
up
for
it
paired
perfectly
with
a
large
sunday
brunch
of
bacon
eggs
and
cinnamon
pancakes
i
would
drink
again
pours
jet
black
with
a
tannish
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
coffee
presence
to
nothing
in
the
taste
a
bit
watery
and
a
mellow
dry
coffee
flavor
a
small
bite
and
a
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
quite
light
across
the
board
and
a
bit
astringent
o
usually
by
this
time
of
year
ive
finished
off
all
of
my
coffee
stouts
so
its
nice
once
in
a
while
to
pull
one
out
and
remind
myself
what
i
like
about
them
this
was
good
but
not
great
middle
of
the
pack
o
close
but
falls
a
little
short
of
being
great
just
need
to
turn
the
volume
up
a
little
bit
overall
i
think
that
it
is
a
very
good
stout
i
would
have
it
again
and
recommend
it
to
friends
poure
out
of
the
tap
with
the
beautiful
nitro
cascade
that
resulted
in
a
super
creamy
two
finger
head
nose
was
freshly
pressed
coffee
with
hints
of
dry
cocoa
and
dark
chocolate
taste
starts
off
with
chocolate
notes
that
is
quickly
replaced
by
a
really
nice
bold
coffee
flavor
coffee
is
very
rich
and
well
accented
the
coffee
is
mixed
in
with
some
dark
chocolates
and
bitter
cocoa
really
nice
coffee
beer
mouth
is
creamy
and
smooth
overall
really
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
the
better
coffee
beers
i
have
tried
notes
very
tasty
a
very
drinkable
american
stout
begining
to
end
cheers
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
it
is
advertised
as
such
worth
trying
a
pretty
sessionable
coffee
stout
overall
impressive
stout
strong
coffee
notes
and
i
can
dig
it
oh
bitter
oh
so
freaking
bitter
upfront
with
espresso
beans
and
100
dark
bakers
chocolate
the
base
beer
is
a
bit
weak
all
i
get
are
the
coffee
and
chocolate
too
bitter
and
unbalanced
overall
it
is
an
alright
coffee
stout
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
this
beer
was
disappointing
i
was
expecting
a
nice
frothy
stout
but
got
a
metallic
taste
instead
jet
black
pour
with
a
medium
tan
head
smell
is
coffee
and
roasted
malts
flavor
was
not
there
metallic
and
old
coffee
taste
overall
hinterland
has
brewed
a
stout
that
has
coffee
coffee
and
then
more
coffee
to
spare
i
really
appreciate
this
beer
for
that
however
the
nose
could
be
just
as
big
as
the
palate
after
all
one
of
the
best
parts
of
coffee
are
the
aromatics
lastly
beef
up
that
body
so
that
is
not
like
downing
a
cold
cup
o
joe
pitch
black
coffee
hue
with
a
big
frothing
tan
head
forming
thick
this
beer
is
pitch
black
it
eats
all
visible
light
waves
head
leaves
behind
even
patterned
speckled
lacing
as
it
dwindles
aroma
dark
chocolate
strong
espresso
dark
nearly
burnt
malts
black
patent
malt
with
some
coffee
notes
as
it
warms
i
get
more
creamed
coffee
notes
in
the
nose
than
i
did
initially
out
of
the
fridge
dry
roasted
malts
its
a
one
note
flavor
profile
with
dark
nearly
burnt
old
coffee
water
the
texture
is
so
watery
for
a
stout
and
the
luna
coffee
mentioned
on
the
label
is
lacking
big
time
hints
of
dry
roasted
coffee
but
nothing
like
ive
tasted
in
other
coffee
beers
mild
green
fruity
character
shows
up
after
a
few
sips
even
hints
of
sourdough
bread
really
a
dry
roasted
malt
fest
one
pint
bottles
is
pretty
nice
a
beer
out
of
green
bay
the
steelers
would
have
won
the
superbowl
if
this
beer
were
against
any
of
the
dark
offerings
from
east
end
in
the
burgh
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
with
astringent
dark
roasted
malts
and
coffee
beans
leaves
an
unpleasant
bitterness
on
the
palate
and
for
a
stout
this
is
a
dry
stout
with
coffee
that
is
remarkably
thin
for
being
a
stout
carbonation
is
moderate
doesnt
add
or
take
anything
away
from
the
party
this
is
my
second
straight
coffee
beer
and
im
wide
awake
guess
what
the
coffee
infused
amber
ale
i
just
had
sleighed
this
big
brusing
pitch
black
coffee
stout
from
the
north
not
bad
all
in
all
smooth
it
out
balance
it
get
that
astringent
element
out
and
its
great
o
our
first
hinterlands
beer
great
move
to
keep
it
simple
would
be
a
wonderful
brunch
beer
o
ok
coffee
stout
but
needs
more
body
to
it
o
the
big
coffee
softer
stout
flavor
with
is
rich
but
not
much
depth
and
is
a
bit
thin
in
the
body
with
a
nice
dry
finish
a
nicely
made
stout
for
sure
but
i
might
not
have
known
this
was
made
with
coffee
had
i
tasted
it
blind
its
somewhat
hard
to
determine
whether
the
deep
roasted
coffee
flavors
come
from
the
malt
or
actual
coffee
a
well
made
beer
nontheless
glad
to
have
tried
it
drinkability
it
is
some
pretty
sinister
stuff
and
i
would
not
mind
drinking
it
with
that
chick
from
the
aaron
rodgers
discount
double
check
commercials
that
is
if
she
has
time
away
from
hanging
out
at
her
state
farm
office
o
this
brew
is
pretty
good
i
dont
know
if
it
lives
up
to
the
standards
of
great
rivers
redband
stout
or
new
glarus
coffee
stout
but
its
a
decent
beer
im
extremely
happy
to
have
tried
it
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
stein
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
a
thick
foamy
dense
towering
head
of
tan
big
bubbled
head
the
aroma
is
bordering
on
a
big
bag
of
coffee
grinds
with
the
slightest
hint
of
dark
chocolate
hidden
in
there
flavors
are
rich
and
strong
and
heavy
in
you
guessed
it
coffee
dark
roasted
and
slightly
bitter
the
coffee
profile
rides
a
somewhat
creamy
and
sweet
backbone
of
malt
flavors
are
a
bit
one
dimensional
smooth
bodied
but
the
overt
bitterness
gives
it
a
somewhat
dry
feel
as
well
very
dynamic
on
the
tongue
and
in
mouth
the
head
retention
is
impressive
the
aftertaste
is
a
mild
version
of
the
taste
with
a
slowly
weening
coffee
profile
the
finish
is
slightly
drying
with
a
slight
linger
to
the
roastiness
decent
but
not
amazing
the
flavor
is
extremely
burnt
like
from
too
much
black
patent
malt
it
tastes
like
day
old
coffee
in
a
decent
way
the
body
is
light
with
a
high
carbonation
very
dry
and
bitter
from
the
overly
toasted
malts
pours
almost
black
as
night
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
consistent
lacing
that
stays
on
glass
smells
just
like
a
black
coffee
tastes
as
good
as
it
smells
and
looks
coffee
right
up
front
with
a
slight
after
taste
of
chocolate
perfect
carbonation
and
consistency
not
a
heavy
stout
can
certainly
drink
more
than
one
just
a
great
beer
glad
i
tried
and
will
buy
more
enjoyable
flavor
but
thin
mouthfeel
detracted
towards
the
end
let
this
warm
a
bit
from
the
fridge
it
poured
with
large
tan
foamy
frothy
sudsy
head
that
soon
settled
out
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
with
a
flashlight
thru
the
narrow
part
of
the
glass
very
deep
dark
red
aroma
is
cocoa
coffee
malt
roast
bit
of
fruit
flavor
is
like
nose
plus
more
sweet
than
bitter
and
only
a
little
carbonic
tang
finish
is
like
flavor
and
has
good
length
a
very
drinkable
beer
session
not
bad
at
all
cheers
o
appearance
and
smell
were
great
but
the
rest
was
just
holding
this
back
from
being
a
world
class
beer
still
its
pretty
good
lowered
to
three
cause
i
felt
the
taste
was
really
a
3
25
this
beer
started
out
strong
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
just
a
little
better
than
ok
i
love
the
fact
that
the
bottles
are
a
pint
though
ill
have
this
again
now
that
its
readily
available
in
il
but
there
are
better
choices
just
as
available
if
you
havent
tried
this
one
go
for
it
appearance
of
this
beer
makes
you
feel
on
1st
pour
that
you
are
going
to
get
something
a
little
more
robust
than
you
do
the
malty
smell
also
adds
to
that
feeling
however
the
head
soon
disappears
and
the
feel
is
a
little
thin
the
taste
is
good
at
the
front
but
for
me
lacks
a
little
at
the
tail
pint
bottle
poured
to
a
regular
pint
glass
not
bad
but
probably
wont
search
this
one
out
again
d
nice
aroma
slightly
lacking
flavor
but
still
a
solid
coffee
stout
valuehowever
there
are
other
coffee
stouts
that
are
just
as
good
and
sell
at
a
lower
price
point
so
i
dont
know
if
i
would
purchase
this
again
super
creamy
and
rich
mouthfeel
make
this
a
goto
stout
for
me
seek
it
out
cheers
overall
this
isnt
bad
but
i
doubt
i
would
buy
it
again
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
completely
opaque
dark
brown
almost
black
had
a
2
finger
head
that
was
a
nice
mocha
brown
that
didnt
cling
at
all
reduced
to
about
a
single
finger
but
had
good
staying
power
poured
exactly
to
the
top
of
the
glass
aroma
was
strongly
of
used
coffee
grounds
with
a
milky
sugar
hint
flavor
started
off
with
hints
of
sour
bitter
but
as
it
rested
those
disappeared
it
ended
up
switching
over
to
a
slightly
water
down
coffee
ice
cream
had
definite
lactose
undertones
felt
good
in
the
mouth
a
bit
acidic
but
coated
fairly
well
and
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
overall
a
solid
stout
flavor
profile
wasnt
my
normal
cup
of
tea
but
i
dont
see
any
issues
with
this
as
a
stout
overall
not
bad
not
great
the
body
and
overall
malt
profile
is
too
thin
but
decent
dark
malt
flavor
and
nice
coffee
addition
o
a
notch
below
solid
for
a
coffee
stout
its
one
dimensional
with
the
best
attributes
being
the
appearance
and
smell
its
a
bit
of
a
let
down
after
that
but
still
good
enough
to
enjoy
i
might
buy
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
good
coffee
stout
and
theres
not
too
much
else
around
o
kind
of
lackluster
and
bland
unfortunately
not
really
something
id
care
to
have
again
new
edition
to
beer
in
nh
i
brought
a
few
bottles
home
today
form
a
tasting
at
berts
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
has
some
staying
power
smells
of
coffee
and
roasted
grains
hints
of
chocolate
but
the
coffee
aromas
are
strong
with
this
one
taste
is
again
coffee
and
roasted
grains
slightly
acridic
but
overall
nicely
coffeed
there
are
hints
of
chocolate
caramel
and
licorice
in
here
but
the
coffee
overwhelms
most
of
the
flavor
here
medium
body
light
to
moderate
level
of
carbonation
slick
oily
acridic
mouthfeel
the
coffee
is
strong
in
this
but
it
still
has
enough
other
flavors
to
keep
it
interesting
i
like
it
d
a
very
decent
beer
but
the
body
is
a
little
disappointing
while
the
flavor
profile
is
a
little
onenote
o
good
beer
overall
the
first
one
was
good
enough
that
i
felt
inspired
to
have
a
second
and
write
a
review
not
the
season
to
fully
appreciate
this
beer
but
im
looking
forward
to
having
one
of
these
on
a
cold
january
evening
d
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
coffee
stout
and
my
favorite
so
far
from
the
hinterland
line
ill
be
stocking
this
in
my
fridge
in
the
near
future
solid
not
a
must
have
im
just
gonna
chalk
it
up
as
unimpressed
so
overall
this
beer
is
fine
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
but
it
was
not
my
favorite
stout
nor
even
my
favorite
coffee
stout
another
gift
single
a
decent
beer
but
both
hinterland
beers
ive
had
are
very
light
in
body
this
one
gives
you
coffee
but
not
much
else
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
pretty
good
coffee
beer
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
worth
trying
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
was
expecting
a
much
stronger
coffee
presence
from
a
beer
advertising
itself
as
such
this
is
not
viscous
or
syrupy
in
any
way
in
fact
it
feels
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
this
doesnt
detract
from
the
fact
that
i
could
drink
several
of
these
not
perfect
but
i
like
it
a
lot
d
not
bad
not
the
best
coffee
stout
ive
had
but
its
certainly
drinkable
glad
to
have
been
able
to
try
this
d
this
is
a
very
delicious
brew
probably
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
two
a
night
simply
due
to
size
and
this
is
definitely
not
a
im
gonna
tie
one
on
beer
but
on
a
cold
winter
night
you
cant
ask
for
a
cold
beer
to
warm
you
up
more
than
this
one
mouthfeeldk
medium
full
body
lightly
carbonated
lightly
acidid
agreeable
and
enjoyable
picked
this
up
in
onalaska
recently
pour
is
dark
brown
with
a
tiny
bit
of
light
peeking
through
the
edges
of
the
glass
no
head
or
lacing
present
smell
is
mostly
roasted
coffee
beans
and
not
much
else
theres
a
bit
of
roasty
malt
and
chocolate
in
the
background
but
its
light
taste
is
very
nice
its
not
a
super
charged
up
stout
but
its
got
great
flavor
although
lacking
in
body
coffee
is
the
dominant
flavor
with
bitterness
mostly
coming
from
that
and
the
roasted
barley
but
its
balanced
out
by
a
mellow
sweetness
all
in
all
this
is
tasty
but
its
a
bit
watery
and
could
definitely
use
a
little
more
body
its
very
drinkable
however
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
two
of
these
16oz
bottles
in
a
sitting
and
not
getting
sick
of
it
like
i
would
with
other
coffee
stouts
decent
stuff
id
been
wary
of
the
bottles
due
to
the
lower
fill
level
but
im
glad
to
report
the
beer
is
perfectly
fine
mouth
feel
is
a
tad
thin
and
there
seems
to
be
a
generous
amount
of
carbonation
i
would
prefer
a
little
less
fizz
and
a
little
more
of
a
creamy
texture
but
that
is
a
personal
preference
drinkability
is
high
as
long
as
you
are
a
fan
of
coffee
because
it
isnt
as
thick
as
some
stouts
it
is
easy
to
plow
through
a
bottle
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
d
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
but
coca
cola
comes
to
mind
big
time
i
dont
think
id
reach
for
this
stout
again
because
of
this
solid
thanks
again

this

blend
into
the
beer
otherwise
it
seems
it
is
not
a
well
intergrated
ingredient
after
the
warming
the
chocolate
and
coffee
really
come
out

show
off

the

could
have
been

d
a
no
nonsense
coffee
stout
with
the
flavor
you
would
expect
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
around
for
fall
this
was
my
first
beer
from
hinterland
and
i
was
impressed
this
had
some
rather
robust
and
roasty
coffee
flavors
but
stayed
well
balanced
with
the
sweetness
and
the
nitropour
and
accessible
body
on
this
really
kicked
the
drinkibility
up
a
notch
well
done
drinkability
quite
sessionable
overall
a
really
solid
local
that
needs
to
get
out

world
thanks
brandon
d
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
coffee
stout
and
its
quite
easy
to
drink
picked
up
a
little
too
much
roasted
bitterness
in
the
taste
especially
on
teh
finish
but
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
d
i
wish
this
had
a
bit
more
heft
its
imperative
that
you
drink
this
at
cellar
temp
or
above
because
its
nearly
lifeless
directly
from
the
refrigerator
all
in
all
a
good
beer
single
sent
down
south
by
the
dirtman
overall
a
solid
coffee

not
world
class
but
very
drinkable
in
all
its
a
very
nice
coffee
stout
drinkability
good
d
very
good
a
very
good
stout
i
wasnt
expecting
this
beer
to
be
as
good
as
it
turned
out
to
be
and
its
always
nice
to
be
surprised
would
highly
recommend
this
one
an
excellent
effort
a
truly
easy
drinking
stout
going
to
be
tough
to
find
here
in
chicagobut
worth
a
look
i
had
this
ontap
at
the
hinterland
location
on
erie
st
in
milwaukee
hinterland
doesnt
brew
at
this
location
and
the
hinterland
beer
served
there
is
shipped
down
from
green
bay
as
i
understand
it
the
best
of
the
bunch
of
the
7
beers
they
had
on
tap
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
i
have
ever
tried
so
smooth
and
tasty
perfect
beer
to
replace
coffee
with
during
dessert
at
the
restaurant
now
if
i
were
thinking
i
would
have
asked
if
they
did
growlers
and
brought
home
several
pints
of
this
delicious
brew
or
trade
it
to
spread
the
word
on
this
masterpiece
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
from
a
wisconsin
brewery
perhaps
the
best
compares
to
speedway
in
many
ways
very
chocolate
smooth
chocolate
finish
bland
everything
i
cant
leave
a
shorter
message
not
sad
i
tried
it
but
probably
not
going
to
have
this
one
again
which
is
disappointing
judging
by
the
great
overall
rating
but
lackluster
recent
reviews
maybe
the
brew
has
changed
creamy
and
a
fair
amount
of
chocolate
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
one
in
a
competitive
style
these
days
a
very
nice
mild
chocolate
stout
not
heavy
nice
balance
of
taste
pours
a
dark
black
color
loses
its
head
and
not
much
lacing
not
as
smooth
as
some
a
little
bite
on
the
back
end
that
somehow
shouldnt
be
there
dark
chocolatey
smooth
stout
not
bitter
at
all

a

stout
well

the
class
of
many

would
not
buy
again
o
the
lack
in
depth
of
flavor
and

disappointed
me

it
was
still

light

the

cloying

odd
overall
boring
weak

and
lacking

if
it
wasnt

this
would

nothing
id

overall
there
are
better
stouts
to
be
had
than
this
while
the
flavor
isnt

it
is
rather

a

also
not

would
be

recommended
buy
at

at

id
say
pass
rather
than
compliment
the
molasses
seems
to
dominate
not
in
that
this
is
an
overwhelmingly
sweet
beer
though
it
is
quite
sweet
but
in
that
the
flavor
of
it
with
the
cheap
grainy
vibe
i
pick
up
is
just
not
something
worth
2
69
a
pop
cocoa

is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
after
having
too
cream

this
beer
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
overall
a
rather
tasty
chocolaty
brew
with
some
nice
big
flavors
sweet
and
delicious
this
is
a
wellmade
beer
the
mouthfeel
alone
makes
it
worth
a
try
poured
onto
a
16
oz
tumbler
only
slight
head
with
virtually
little
retension
mild
aroma
with
a
decent

taste
but
a
rather
musty
aftertaste
not
as
heavy
or
as
flavorful
as
you
would
expect
a
full

stout
to
be
weak
on
flavor
doest
compare
w
most
stouts
on
the
market
today
will
not
buy
again
overall
not
bad
but
not
as
chocolatey
as
the
name
would
imply
also
i
dont
notice
much
sweetness
in
spite
of
the
lactose
for
what
would
seem
like
a
similar
brew
to

hoo
im
a
bit
disappointed
if
the

im
actually
being

be

bad

but
then
again
theres
no

it
should
be

d
the
nose
got
me
interested
but
unfortunately
this
beer
falls
just
north
of
average
new
beer
t
first
it
seems
its
not
a
particularly
big
stout
but
it
does
end
up
having
quite
a
bit
of
heft
the
body
is
full
and
rich
with
a
good
creamy
bulk
to
it
its
fortunate
that
it
doesnt
sit
to
heavy
and
i
think
a
good
balance
is
struck
in
the
feel
as
well
as
in
the
other
aspects
the
combination
of
thickness
and
sweetness
tends
toward
a
sticky
feel
but
its
ultimately
kept
in
check
overall
okay
but
certainly
doesnt
live
up
to
the
loco
chocolate
level
in
my
opinion
really
flavorful
and
tasty
stout
good
rich
character
definitely
worth
trying
and
i
would
have
it
again

a
interesting
try
but
not
hitting
the
mark
for
me
poured
like
a
stout
thick
and
black
with
a
nice
khaki
head
that
stayed
for
a
minute
or
two
the
scent
is
weak
a
bit
of
malt
a
bit
of
graham
cracker
even
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
nice
not
overly
flavorful
but
nice
the
chocolate
and
graham
cracker
are
there
nothing
complex
but
nice
theres
a
touch
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
but
i
like
it
this
brew
is
nothing
special
but
id
certainly
drink
it
again
and
enjoy
it
unfortunately
i
never
did
no
matter
how
much
this
warmed
up
it
felt
a
lot
stronger
than
it
actually
was
and
the
kind
of
chocolate
that
this
emulated
was
not
powdery
enough
to
match
the
flavors
and
aroma
this
was
a
different
stout
but
certainly
not
better
and
with
so
many
coming
onto
the
shelves
this
time
of
the
year
there
are
plenty
of
better
options
to
spend
your
money
on
pretty
nice
stout
smooth
creamy
body
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
mild
chocolate
and
cocoa
powder
up
front
rolls
into
a
bitter
black
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
with
an
underlying
earthy
bitterness
faint
chalky
mouthfeel
good
balance
faint
alcohol
heat
and
mild
bitterness
that
builds
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
not
overly
complex
but
has
enough
going
on
overall
a
pretty
nice
stout
but
should
definitely
come
in
6
packs
alcohol
heat
and
astringency
takes
away
from
the
beer
slightly
a
flavorful
stout
that
is
unbalanced
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
its
only
above
average
due
to
the
nice
complex
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
flavor
that
basically
rule
the
taste
it
was
good
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
wouldnt
run
out
to
buy
it
yet
id
definitely
have
it
again
if
i
saw
it
at
a
bar
do
enjoyable
and
repeatable
overall
a
great
stout
and
i
like
the
creative
additions
to
the
recipe
they
definitely
spent
some
time
with
this
perfecting
the
balance
and
the
result
is
very
tasty
not
bad
at
all
much
more
bitter
than
im
used
to
in
a
stout
brewed
with
lactose
but
an
interesting
combination
worth
trying
but
i
dont
think
id
pay
over
3
for
another
bottle
overall
its
an
ok
beer
overall
good
brew
here
very
mocha
like
tasty
bl
d
very
drinkable
not
the
best
stout
ive
had
but
overall
it
was
very
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
drink
again
pours
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
khaki
head
maybe
a
touch
watery
on
the
nose
but
otherwise
nice
roast
and
chocolate
aromas
a
hint
of
coffee
and
some
molasses
for
sweetness
the
flavor
isnt
bad
but
similarly
watery
cocoachocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malt
make
up
most
of
the
substance
a
slight
sweetness
of
toffee
and
molasses
too
not
bad
but
not
great
either
o
a
decent
beer
one
id
gladly
drink
again
but
wont
go
seeking
out
an
awesome
looking
stout
that
was
very
drinkable
the
flavors
were
muddied
up
at
times
but
the
clean
and
sweeter
finish
were
the
highlights
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
sweet
and
smooth
throughout
the
taste
a
bit
dry
on
the
finish
mediumbodied
and
a
pleasant
easily
drinkable
sipper
o
im
not
sure
why
everyone
is
hating
on
this
beer
so
much
i
thought
it
was
a
very
tasty
stout
yes
its
mostly
all
the
way
over
on
the
sweet
rather
than
bitter
side
of
the
spectrum
but
not
artificially
so
i
think
the
lactose
blends
well
with
the
molasses
and
chocolate
which
i
definitely
thought
had
a
strong
presence
here
i
thought
this
was
a
tasty
beer
and
ill
look
for
more
from
arcadia
in
the
future
this
beer
pours
pitch
black
with
a
rather
modest
one
finger
of
a
brown
head
not
a
whole
lot
of
retention
the
smell
is
quite
nice
on
this
one
some
cocoa
and
coffee
as
well
as
some
roastiness
the
smell
is
this
beers
best
quality
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
chocolate
coffee
and
a
nice
complex
malt
variety
i
do
think
this
beer
could
have
lost
the
lactose
sugar
and
been
fine
because
its
a
little
too
bitter
sweet
overall
this
is
a
solid
stout
not
as
heavy
on
the
chocolate
as
i
would
have
liked
but
a
pretty
solid
offering
from
arcadia
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
i
picked
up
a
single
simply
because
the
description
sounded
interesting
its
a
nice
beer
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
i
have
found
better
milksweet
stouts
than
this
i
get
a
stouts
nose
full
of
roast
and
a
bit
of
the
lactic
stout
aroma
if
i
was
to
map
the
flavor
out
id
say
that
theres
a
bit
of
a
roast
up
front
followed
by
a
noticeable
bitterness
and
a
lactic
sting
before
finishing
sweet
and
malty
yet
dry
flavor
coats
the
mouth
and
lingers
in
a
way
that
i
find
enjoyable
a
big
pleasing
dessert
brew
that
id
gladly
try
again
if
given
the
chance
o
im
glad
i
bought
only
one
bottle
and
not
a
6pack
or
case
what
this
beer
has
in
look
feel
it
lacks
in
taste
wish
there
were
more
chocolate
notes
to
this
beer
especially
if
its
labeled
as
a
chocolate
stout
its
more
similar
to
a
milk
stout
than
anything
else
but
a
very
lightly
flavored
one
at
that
m
somewhat
thin
and
watery
a
bit
too
bubbly
as
well
carbonation
was
distractingly
high
o
i
hate
to
dog
on
arcadia
beers
but
this
beer
is
not
good
i
bought
a
four
pack
and
wish
i
hadnt
i
havent
been
this
disappointed
since
mackinac
island
fudge
stout
i
was
really
expecting
a
good
to
great
beer
not
so
much
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
especially
the
bitterness
that
prevailed
throughout
the
taste
there
were
some
other
sweet
flavors
going
on
that
kept
it
easy
to
drink
but
it
was
very
robust
which
i
tend
to
want
in
this
style
good
beer
overall
for
the
price
this
beer
is
a
rockstar
lets
be
honest
this
could
not
stand
up
to
a
barrelaged
stout
or
deep
dark
russian
but
for
the
style
its
spot
on
o
pretty
average
nothing
sticks
out
as
that
great
with
this
beer
even
the
taste
which
is
supposed
tp
be
quite
chocolately
strikes
me
as
fairly
unremarkable
o
as
i
love
chocolate
stouts
i
wanted
to
love
this
beer
but
i
cannot
too
much
roast
flavor
and
not
enough
chocolate
o
a
little
heavy
on
the
chocolate
side
of
things
for
my
taste
but
if
youre
a
chocolate
lover
this
is
your
stout
note
live
review
the
mouthfell
is
grainy
and
tart
sweet
and
tart
in
and
out
interesting
o
i
thought
this
was
a
fairly
good
representation
of
the
style
it
is
on
the
sweeter
side
though
chocolate
flavoring
in
it
o
the
taste
had
wonderful
depth
to
it
but
this
beer
wasnt
much
to
look
at
and
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
overall
i
would
call
it
a
tie
between
this
and
youngs
its
a
good
stout
but
theres
much
better
out
there
on
a
regular
basis
i
bought
this
looking
for
something
sweet
and
chocolatey
and
thats
not
what
i
got
at
all
cocoa
loco
pours
a
black
color
with
a
darker
tan
head
there
is
a
nice
chocolate
smell
the
taste
is
creamy
its
malty
but
has
a
nice
blend
of
chocolate
that
doesnt
overpower
there
is
almost
like
a
chocolate
milk
flavor
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
no
problem
having
a
few
of
these
overall
a
very
nice
stout
the
chocolate
doesnt
over
power
mixes
very
well
o
stradles
the
line
between
a
traditional
americn
stout
and
a
double
stout
at
7
abv
kind
of
the
best
of
both
worlds
a
nice
sipper
that
doesnt
knock
you
over
a
lot
going
on
with
the
chocolate
lactose
and
molasses
additions
fortunately
they
compliment
one
another
and
nothing
gets
lost
o
not
impressed
at
all
no
dates
on
bottle
and
guy
at
store
said
they
just
got
it
in
so
i
assumed
it
was
recent
the
chocolatecocoa
character
is
well
done
but
id
like
to
see
more
complexity
in
the
malt
flavors
to
make
this
a
better
example
of
the
style
none
the
less
a
good
brew
and
id
not
turn
down
another
serving
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
beer
with
a
name
like
cocoa
loco
i
thought
that
chocolate
was
going
to
be
the
main
flavor
in
this
beer
but
to
my
surprise
it
was
the
coffee
that
stuck
out
the
most
the
mixture
of
both
was
pretty
nice
and
to
my
liking
but
i
would
have
liked
the
chocolate
to
be
in
the
forefront
and
the
coffee
in
the
background
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
just
looked
really
nice
in
my
imperial
pint
glass
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
was
spot
on
but
it
just
seemed
to
be
a
little
thin
and
watery
for
the
style
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
of
drinkability
in
this
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
more
then
one
in
a
sitting
i
may
pick
this
up
when
i
need
a
coffee
and
chocolate
fix
and
there
is
no
fbs
around
but
if
i
had
to
choose
between
the
two
it
would
be
fbs
every
time
the
taste
is
a
little
similar
but
fbs
does
it
much
better
if
your
a
big
fan
of
coffee
and
chocolate
forward
beers
this
is
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
it
to
blow
your
socks
off
this
is
a
descent
offering
from
arcadia
but
when
i
can
get
fbs
for
the
same
price
ill
go
with
the
fbs
every
time
overall
looks
aroma
and
taste
is
all
quite
nice
a
bit
to
thin
for
the
style
but
this
is
still
something
i
would
be
happy
having
regularly
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
pretty
nice
looking
deep
brownish
black
color
with
a
fluffy
brown
head
on
top
the
aromas
of
sweet
chocolate
fill
your
nose
right
away
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
the
far
end
of
the
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
sweet
with
a
light
bitterness
of
dark
chocolate
in
there
the
other
flavors
of
roasted
malts
come
through
after
the
swallow
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
medium
to
heavy
with
a
smooth
texture
to
it
overall
i
thought
this
wasnt
a
bad
brew
to
try
o
overall
a
solid
effort
minus
the
clear
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
one
to
pick
up
for
sure
but
not
necessarily
one
to
keep
going
back
to
all
in
all
i
had
high
hopes
and
this
didnt
really
come
close
not
really
together
like
i
had
hoped
not
as
full
or
rich
as
i
wanted
but
the
flavors
are
unfortunately
there
begging
for
a
thick
rich
luscious
mouthfeel
that
it
just
kind
of
falls
flat
like
a
helium
balloon
a
few
days
past
its
prime
o
anything
remotely
decent
in
this
beer
is
overpowered
by
an
off
flavor
or
unpleasant
factor
alcohol
presence
is
just
waaay
to
much
like
straight
ethanol
this
is
the
little
beer
that
could
but
didnt
overall
not
bad
nice
malt
flavors
doesnt
get
too
burnt
or
briny
but
the
whole
mouth
and
body
just
feel
like
its
missing
something
o
the
mouthfeel
and
sweetness
really
dominated
this
beer
for
me
wanted
to
really
love
this
beer
but
it
was
a
bit
off
full
disclosure
i
drank
this
the
same
evening
as
i
enjoyed
a
founders
breakfast
stout
so
my
scores
may
be
skewed
slightly
lower
hard
to
compare
to
that
one
od
the
chocolate
isnt
as
strong
as
the
coffee
but
even
that
factor
keeps
it
at
a
slightly
above
average
stout
i
dont
know
this
is
a
somewhat
unusual
beer
what
with
the
lactose
but
it
wasnt
a
beer
i
really
got
into
i
may
give
it
another
try
its
decent
kind
of
has
an
identity
crisis
does
it
want
to
be
sweet
or
roasty
does
it
want
to
be
thin
or
full
does
it
want
to
be
bitter
or
sweet
does
it
want
to
be
chocolaty
or
milky
it
falls
short
of
being
balanced
because
of
the
detectable
offflavors
though
if
it
went
one
direction
or
the
other
it
may
get
past
those
off
qualities
as
it
is
its
a
decent
brew
but
it
falls
short
of
many
other
available
options
o
a
very
good
stout
something
i
could
definitely
stand
to
keep
stocked
in
my
beer
fridge
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
a
solid
b
in
my
book
overall
i
would
have
liked
this
one
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
and
have
a
thicker
body
overall
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
dont
know
that
i
feel
the
need
to
have
it
again
o
was
actually
darned
good
on
nitro
and
id
try
again
is
a
good
beer
with
dessert
given
the
cocoa
potency
this
excellent
stout
is
very
dark
with
a
thick
dark
brown
head
the
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
chocolate
come
through
on
the
nose
as
you
take
the
first
swallow
in
the
mouth
it
is
very
thick
and
creamy
with
a
hint
of
spicyness
that
blends
well
with
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
had
this
beer
at
the
good
life
in
massapequa
ny
d
great
dessert
drink
full
of
rich
dark
flavors
and
sweet
too
needs
to
rid
itself
of
the
drip
coffee
taste
and
feel
i
get
should
get
a
richer
and
deeper
espresso
taste
to
it
still
comes
wellrecommended
from
me
o
very
smooth
and
tasty
beer
it
seems
to
fit
more
into
the
the
sweet
stout
13b
category
than
the
american
stout
category
a
little
more
carbonation
would
bring
this
into
the
next
level
of
greatness
overall
this
is
a
darned
tasty
chocolate
stout
not
as
bold
or
thick
as
most
others
which
makes
it
easier
to
drink
yet
sacrifices
thickness
and
creaminess
has
a
fantastic
and
distinct
cocoa
aroma
this
makes
for
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
d
very
nice
id
order
another
and
buy
again
o
i
think
a
richer
mouthfeel
could
have
saved
this
would
have
helped
that
chocolate
hang
around
and
really
pop
but
it
doesnt
deliver
overall
pretty
good
right
in
the
middle
between
a
highlydrinkable
session
ale
and
a
slow
sipper
the
third
beer
this
evening
for
me
was
the
arcadia
cocoa
loco
and
yes
there
is
not
question
that
chocolate
was
used
to
brew
this
beer
the
color
was
absolutely
dark
with
virtually
no
head
the
smell
was
very
chocolately
and
sweet
like
molassis
the
taste
was
very
heavy
almost
like
a
sweet
liquior
definite
chocolate
semisweet
with
molassis
very
rich
plenty
of
body
just
too
sweet
for
my
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
tough
because
of
the
sweetness
not
enough
balance
while
drinking
this
i
find
myself
thinking
that
this
is
what
the
original
chocolate
beverage
of
native
peoples
could
have
tasted
like
sort
of
while
you
can
call
this
a
stout
its
almost
like
its
own
style
of
that
genre
the
superchocolaty
stout
the
flavor
is
big
enough
to
make
this
a
sipper
and
the
alcohol
level
is
just
about
there
too
if
you
enjoy
chocolate
or
chocolatetasting
beverages
you
should
check
this
one
out
i
know
ill
be
returning
to
it
good
worth
trying
this
pours
slate
black
with
just
a
little
bit
of
light
through
at
the
edges
the
head
is
two
fingers
espresso
crema
colored
with
a
little
lace
on
the
nose
there
is
a
great
combination
of
ultrarich
chocolate
a
huge
molasses
note
a
slightly
sour
lactose
note
a
dark
roasted
malts
to
me
the
only
fault
is
that
the
lactose
might
be
a
step
ahead
of
where
it
ought
to
be
in
the
balance
in
the
mouth
all
of
the
parts
of
the
nose
are
apparent
on
various
parts
of
the
tongue
with
the
lactose
hanging
in
the
background
until
a
long
finish
leaves
it
as
the
last
thing
on
the
tongue
the
body
is
medium
light
much
lighter
than
id
have
expected
based
on
the
nose
and
pour
and
while
its
not
bad
to
the
point
of
distraction
its
definitely
short
on
body
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
might
classify
as
a
milk
stout
due
to
the
lactose
which
is
just
on
the
safe
side
of
enjoyable
for
me
overall
fairly
disappointed
in
this
brew
its
drinkable
as
in
im
going
to
drink
it
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
anyone
perhaps
my
opinion
is
swayed
because
i
had
an
ris
to
precede
this
one
but
seriously
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
good
no
matter
when
you
drink
it
and
this
just
isnt
hitting
the
spot
i
am
more
likely
to
go
on
the
same
cruise
than
buy
this
again
but
the
cruise
would
have
been
better
had
they
had
this
brew
o
not
bad
its
a
bit
of
an
oddity
of
sorts
as
some
of
the
flavors
are
really
indescribable
but
the
complexity
is
there
its
probably
a
bit
too
outside
the
box
for
a
lot
of
people
and
i
wouldnt
consider
it
sessionable
not
bad
but
not
great
either
but
if
you
want
to
try
something
a
bit
different
this
one
wouldnt
be
bad
to
give
a
shot
this
is
a
drain
pour
without
question
i
want
to
try
this
fresh
but
it
seems
all
i
see
lately
are
35
year
old
bottles
of
arcadias
beers
and
they
are
showing
up
new
to
the
stores
i
have
no
idea
if
theres
some
weird
issue
with
kentuckys
distribution
chains
or
what
either
way
im
skeptical
to
blame
this
beer
completely
on
the
age
considering
all
their
beers
seem
to
give
off
this
odd
flavor
d
nothing
outstanding
either
way
the
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
and
its
a
decently
tasty
brew
but
just
not
what
i
expected
i
was
expecting
a
big
in
your
face
stout
the
label
says
its
a
stout
brewed
with
chocolate
mollasses
and
lactose
in
addition
to
the
claim
of
it
being
chewey
it
led
me
to
thinking
this
beer
was
going
to
be
a
monster
brew
so
dont
expect
that
but
know
its
a
very
solid
tasty
brew
brewed
in
collaboration
with
sonny
of
cocoa
puffs
fame
you
never
know
it
pours
a
sleek
obsidian
topped
by
a
lovely
finger
of
creamecru
froth
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
light
coffee
very
light
molasses
and
a
touch
of
char
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
the
roast
back
with
a
vengeance
along
with
some
of
that
char
and
a
heaping
amount
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
it
all
comes
out
a
bit
astringent
to
the
tongue
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
drying
finish
overall
a
decent
stout
but
things
didnt
seem
to
come
together
all
the
way
for
me
d
well
for
3
50
a
12oz
bottle
i
would
never
get
it
again
but
with
no
balance
and
such
harsh
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
tones
it
really
doesnt
seem
worth
getting
again
there
are
more
drinkable
stouts
out
there
so
avoid
if
you
can
drinkability
not
one
i
would
like
to
drink
straight
very
often
possibly
as
something
heavy
to
pair
up
with
an
overly
sweet
dessert
i
think
this
is
also
best
enjoyed
in
8oz
servings
very
much
a
sipper
not
for
quenching
thirst
this
is
surely
the
most
charismatic
stout
ive
had
thus
far
and
ill
surely
look
for
it
again
the
beer
is
kind
of
a
mess
i
did
find
it
unique
and
interesting
but
other
aspects
of
the
beer
did
not
sit
at
all
with
me
overall
big
brew
with
a
lot
going
on
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
because
of
it
feel
like
some
time
in
the
cellar
might
do
it
well
tasty
though
with
some
fun
mouthfeel
thanks
to
their
adjuncts
cocoa
and
molasses
are
evident
but
not
overwhelming
if
i
see
any
more
out
and
about
i
will
lay
a
bottle
or
two
down
for
a
while
to
see
if
the
flavors
meld
together
a
little
better
with
some
time
d
good
drinkability
for
a
bigger
beer
might
be
tough
to
put
too
many
of
these
down
im
really
noticing
the
bitterness
thanks
dan
for
sharing
this
one
last
weekend
poured
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
aromas
of
molasses
vanilla
creme
brulee
and
milk
chocolate
on
the
palate
this
one
was
rather
thin
for
a
stout
with
flavors
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malt
with
a
rather
bitter
finish
black
beer
creamy
brown
head
moderate
amounts
of
lacing
interesting
aroma
and
quite
complex
i
get
the
molasses
in
there
but
also
heavy
chocolate
coffee
and
black
licorice
overall
impression
on
the
buds
is
fairly
sweet
with
the
lactose
and
molasses
and
whatnot
full
flavored
there
arent
many
beers
id
just
want
one
of
but
this
is
one
of
them
really
heavy
and
rich
definite
dessert
beer
full
bodied
and
viscous
get
flavors
of
leather
and
licorice
as
well
bakers
chocolate
well
done
actually
for
the
type
of
beer
that
it
is
bottle
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
tiny
bubbled
tan
head
dark
chocolate
oat
leather
and
chocolate
again
domintate
the
aroma
nice
velvety
medium
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
sharp
transition
to
some
bittersweet
chocolate
notes
along
with
some
leather
notes
some
booze
notes
as
well
along
with
a
touch
of
metallic
lingering
bitterness
some
lace
on
the
glass
as
the
head
settles
for
being
called
cocoa
loco
i
would
like
to
see
this
have
a
more
chocolate
forward
flavor
very
dense
darkness
with
a
small
tan
head
that
had
decent
retention
before
settling
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
pleasant
aroma
of
something
along
the
lines
of
chocolate
milk
and
graham
crackers
there
is
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
that
is
detectable
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
not
quite
so
nice
because
the
alcohol
is
hot
for
a
7
abv
stout
otherwise
the
chocolate
malt
is
featured
nicely
bitterness
is
moderate
despite
the
lactose
addition
medium
body
with
a
nice
texture
not
creamy
but
is
soft
and
nicely
carbonated
not
quite
a
desert
beer
as
it
is
not
very
sweet
but
has
some
nice
chocolate
qualities
d
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
some
what
good
beer
i
think
that
for
a
imperial
stout
4pk
i
would
look
in
other
places
as
well
as
if
i
wanted
to
show
someone
a
chocolate
beer
i
would
move
on
as
for
this
brew
it
is
a
nice
session
stout
with
nice
flavors
and
complex
subtleties
pours
near
with
with
a
nearly
nonexistent
head
and
no
lacing
somewhat
forgivable
given
the
style
nose
brings
a
good
amount
of
cocoa
and
roast
plus
a
touch
of
coffee
and
vanilla
really
strong
cocoa
the
taste
adds
in
a
bit
of
extra
vanilla
flavor
though
its
quite
faint
delivers
hard
on
the
cocoa
with
quite
a
bit
of
roast
in
the
background
medium
body
and
somewhat
smooth
actually
really
smooth
drinks
really
nicely
a
solid
hit
for
arcadia
drinks
great
solid
abv
here
a
not
sessionable
but
smooth
stout
a
standup
beer
while
not
overly
big
as
it
holds
on
to
its
drinkable
character
its
big
enough
to
know
that
this
is
a
sipper
two
thumb
up
here
if
you
are
looking
to
pair
this
one
dont
go
for
the
usual
chocolate
try
it
against
some
chiliinfused
chocolate
or
a
spicy
mole
sauce
over
chicken
i
could
do
two
of
these
tops
but
its
because
it
drinks
like
an
imperial
stout
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
beer
hard
to
believe
it
is
only
seven
percent
abv
it
is
tasty
and
unique
this
is
a
bit
of
a
hidden
gym
with
an
overall
score
of
a
b
i
recommend
giving
this
a
whirl
with
as
many
good
chocolate
stouts
as
there
are
i
dont
think
ill
give
this
one
another
try
arcadia
cocoa
loco
is
a
brownblack
beer
with
a
dense
light
brown
head
that
fades
to
a
film
and
leaves
excellent
lacing
it
has
a
roasty
aroma
with
notes
of
chocolate
coffee
and
licorice
its
smooth
and
full
bodied
with
a
scratchy
chalky
finish
it
has
a
nice
roasty
flavor
it
tastes
just
like
the
aroma
theres
some
sweetness
to
it
and
the
bitter
finish
seems
to
come
from
the
chocolate
it
would
be
awesome
if
it
wasnt
so
tongue
shredding
lighter
body
carbonation
is
slightly
low
seems
thin
to
me
a
bit
boozy
after
a
few
minutes
not
the
amount
of
cocoa
or
lactose
that
i
thought
there
would
be
rather
disappointing
overall
this
beer
was
alright
but
i
have
had
much
better
too
much
lactose
flavors
not
very
drinkable
because
of
this
i
like
some
of
the
flavors
but
wow
this
is
drinking
slow
drinkability
who
says
a
big
stout
is
not
a
good
summer
beer
very
smooth
rich
and
enjoyable
without
being
heavy
d
a
decent
stout
with
a
lot
of
nice
cocoachocolate
would
try
again
d
the
beer
was
relatively
easy
to
consume
and
is
a
good
dessert
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
somewhat
dry
stout
that
has
flavors
of
bittersweet
chocolate
d
a
very
good
beer
would
drink
ti
again
i
was
hoping
for
a
malt
bomb
and
got
a
hoppy
mess
the
hops
they
used
didnt
fit
the
rest
of
the
beer
too
bitter
west
coast
hops
dont
fit
with
this
beer
notes
this
beer
has
a
nice
mingling
of
favor
notes
firm
palate
and
a
very
drinkable
7abv
what
is
not
to
like
frinkability
a
good
sipper
that
id
only
want
one
of
at
a
sitting
but
thats
no
reflection
on
the
quality
of
the
brew
as
it
is
good
d
moderate
drinkability
can
be
a
hair
filling
abv
is
higher
but
manageable
for
light
sessioning
flavors
are
a
hair
potent
for
a
multibeer
run
d
the
flavors
have
certainly
transformed
with
a
little
age
the
chocolate
and
cocoa
are
much
more
pronounced
as
is
the
alcohol
d
a
very
average
lacto
chocolate
stout
i
cant
say
i
find
anything
overly
tasty
about
this
beer
however
i
also
cant
say
its
offensive
either
conclusion
not
bad
persay
but
not
something
id
pick
up
again
either
its
not
good
its
not
bad
it
just
kinda
is
d
solid
effort
top
to
bottom
glad
to
see
the
bottle
i
marked
down
isnt
reflected
on
tap
at
least
in
this
batch
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
decent
frothy
tan
head
good
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
and
roasted
malts
cocoa
a
hint
of
metal
and
a
little
bit
of
an
acidic
burn
flavor
is
sweet
and
roasted
malts
coffee
chocolate
dark
fruits
and
lactic
acid
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
creamy
soft
carbonated
and
fairly
bitter
pretty
good
beer
lots
of
chocolate
gets
more
acidic
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
this
is
an
enjoyable
fairly
complex
chocolate
beer
that
marries
flavors
quite
well
the
smell
is
a
distinctive
dark
chocolate
and
molasses
the
beer
is
fullbodied
clearly
showing
its
7
0
abv
and
has
strong
chcolate
roasted
malt
and
caramel
notes
while
i
enjoyed
this
id
probably
stick
to
just
one
considering
its
strong
flavor
and
heaviness
i
would
not
buy
it
again
with
my
dime
but
would
drink
it
again
d
this
is
a
decent
stout
at
first
i
was
pretty
disappointed
but
enjoyed
it
more
and
more
as
i
drank
it
not
bad
but
nothing
uberly
special
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
super
drinkable
it
went
down
way
too
easily
and
im
reaching
for
another
one
d
decently
balanced
goes
down
quite
easily
not
an
outstanding
representation
of
the
style
but
it
is
rather
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
turn
a
pint
away
i
bet
this
is
heavenly
on
tap
but
in
the
bottle
there
is
an
obvious
problem
drain
pour
next
review
very
dark
brown
low
carbonation
slight
chocolate
aroma
that
balances
well
with
the
hops
and
malt
a
very
good
beer
dnot
a
very
compelling
beer
the
taste
is
okay
many
better
stouts
out
there
daverage
at
best
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
mostly
roasted
malt
and
seems
watered
down
the
beer
started
off
alright
but
the
growler
got
tired
really
early
the
score
is
a
touch
generous
its
merely
the
sum
of
its
parts
notes
while
the
harsh
bitter
dark
roast
nearly
burnt
malt
reduced
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
it
is
clearly
better
than
several
of
the
other
arcadia
ales
in
that
it
provided
much
interest
several
of
the
others
anglers
ale
comes
to
mind
were
really
boring
lastly
i
do
not
know
how
this
is
not
a
milk
stout
md
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
and
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
a
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
and
little
lacing
smells
of
burnt
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
sour
milk
taste
much
better
than
the
smell
sweet
and
bitter
chocolate
with
a
dry
finish
thin
to
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
actually
pretty
drinkable
i
would
have
another
if
the
price
was
right
overall
i
dug
this
one
nice
balanced
drinkable
beer
i
didnt
even
notice
the
alcohol
worth
a
try
beer
is
black
with
a
brown
head
it
doesnt
last
very
long
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
perhaps
some
butterscotch
as
well
although
not
much
the
aroma
of
alcohol
is
present
as
well
beer
tastes
a
bit
hoppy
at
first
more
of
a
goldings
type
flavor
this
is
followed
by
a
rich
roastiness
and
a
malty
sweetness
and
finishing
with
a
deep
roasted
note
the
mouthfeel
is
very
silky
and
smooth
perhaps
i
dont
taste
the
chocolate
as
strongly
as
it
might
be
implied
on
the
packaging
but
i
think
its
more
in
the
aroma
this
beer
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
very
generous
head
with
that
quickly
dissipated
to
a
thin
skin
the
aroma
was
chocolate
the
taste
was
chocolate
and
molasses
but
weak
uninspired
feel
initially
felt
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
but
as
it
warmed
medium
while
losing
some
of
the
carbonation
drinkability
is
fair
loco
did
improve
as
it
warmed
probably
worth
a
tasting
but
dont
make
the
mistake
of
buying
more
than
a
bomber
pours
a
deep
black
with
no
visibility
through
the
brew
up
top
is
a
12
finger
tan
color
head
that
lingers
around
a
while
smell
is
dominate
with
chocolate
nothing
else
really
hits
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
milk
chocolate
no
bitter
finish
and
not
much
alcohol
is
noted
i
am
a
little
disappointed
in
that
yes
the
quaff
only
consists
of
chocolate
it
is
not
a
very
overpowering
in
your
face
taste
it
is
a
little
too
smooth
and
light
for
my
liking
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
drinkability
is
mediocre
i
am
usually
nuts
about
this
style
of
beer
but
the
thing
i
like
about
them
is
the
overpowering
chocolate
taste
that
makes
the
style
overall
i
think
it
is
pretty
solid
and
will
continue
to
stock
some
in
my
dbf
when
available
poured
nearblack
with
zero
head
into
a
guinness
glass
absolutely
zero
hint
of
hops
in
the
nose
or
flavor
if
youre
a
chocolate
fanatic
the
smell
will
be
addictive
as
there
are
no
other
discernible
aromatic
characteristics
the
flavor
is
absurdly
thick
and
chocolate
for
a
beer
ive
had
good
chocolate
stouts
before
but
the
good
ones
were
balanced
with
hints
of
hops
and
other
flavors
this
beer
is
onedimensional
think
chocolate
milkshake
without
the
dairy
too
thick
to
drink
more
than
one
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
a
clump
of
brown
loose
bubbles
forms
up
around
12
cm
but
it
falls
fast
leaving
only
a
bit
of
lacing
fits
the
usual
description
nothing
impressive
the
comes
off
first
with
a
nice
roasty
whiff
floating
on
the
co2
then
comes
the
chocolate
it
starts
out
like
raw
cocoa
powder
but
then
it
gets
creamy
and
full
theres
almost
a
milky
smell
surprise
theres
lactose
after
looking
at
the
bottle
it
smells
sugary
but
not
sickeningly
sweet
actually
once
tasteing
it
its
not
even
close
to
being
as
sweet
as
it
smells
i
actually
which
the
taste
was
a
bit
sweeter
but
theres
plenty
that
is
interesting
in
there
tastes
like
dessert
without
quite
as
much
sugar
theres
a
nice
molasses
presence
combined
with
the
cocoa
powder
thats
a
bit
of
an
obvious
statement
i
suppose
theres
a
bit
of
a
slickness
which
is
common
in
dryer
stouts
theres
a
bit
of
a
cherry
or
raspberry
taste
too
the
molasses
flavor
is
most
prominent
in
the
taste
but
the
chocolate
does
not
have
a
very
major
presence
here
the
taste
isnt
exactly
exceptional
but
its
interesting
and
could
definitely
be
worse
i
would
say
that
there
ought
to
be
a
bit
more
sweetness
maybe
a
bit
more
roastiness
and
if
its
supposed
to
be
cocoa
loco
then
the
chocolate
should
be
toned
up
in
the
taste
also
the
body
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
which
isnt
much
in
the
stout
category
the
carbonation
is
kind
of
nice
not
stingy
not
harsh
but
pleasant
but
still
this
is
about
average
in
the
style
overall
i
think
its
just
a
bit
too
dry
and
a
little
too
slick
its
a
fairly
enjoyable
drink
not
too
heavy
or
high
in
abv
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
more
its
enjoyable
at
least
once
and
interesting
but
it
doesnt
exactly
deliver
completely
on
what
i
was
hoping
for
a
sessionable
stout
and
one
i
would
seek
out
again
flavor
definately
didnt
improve
as
it
the
brew
warmed
no
signifigant
difference
in
flavor
than
an
average
stout
mouthfeel
was
too
heavy
to
enjoy
at
its
seasonal
release
time
if
you
are
expecting
something
special
dont
was
you
time
on
this
one
d
i
would
reccommend
this
beer
to
a
serious
beer
advocate
but
not
to
newcomers
to
hoppy
chocolate
beers
i
thought
this
was
great
pours
very
dark
brown
just
about
black
in
the
glass
very
little
khaki
colored
foam
nose
is
sweet
roasted
chocolate
with
some
nutty
notes
with
a
touch
of
molasses
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
and
heavy
but
creamy
and
surprisingly
carbonated
the
sweetness
really
comes
out
very
creamy
roasted
taste
almost
like
something
youd
get
at
starbucks
pretty
much
understated
flavor
for
a
big
beer
like
this
oh
so
smooth
though
really
a
nice
big
stout
without
being
overbearing
d
very
drinkable
very
tasty
i
didnt
even
know
this
was
a
vintage
2006
till
i
got
home
i
would
like
to
try
one
fresh
and
record
the
difference
if
any
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
and
do
recommend
it
drinkability
even
as
i
take
the
last
sip
i
still
love
the
nose
on
this
one
its
too
bad
that
this
beer
fell
kinda
fell
flat
after
that
with
a
few
more
adjustments
this
one
could
really
be
something
special
but
right
now
it
feels
like
an
unfinished
product
on
tap
at
mr
goodbardark
pour
significant
chocolate
and
coffee
but
otherwise
unexceptional
burnt
more
than
roast
when
so
many
are
doing
the
similar
so
similar
ranking
brown
with
white
head
on
the
sweeter
side
despite
english
progress
liberty
summit
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
feel
that
makes
it
fairly
easy
to
drink
id
probably
drink
this
one
again
if
given
the
chance
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
track
it
down
though
more
of
a
dessert
beer
than
anything
all
in
all
not
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
but
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
for
sure
the
feel
is
dry
but
oily
and
slick
thick
and
tremendous
its
a
heavy
and
really
outstanding
chocolate
stout
sweet
dry
bitter
nutty
and
everything
in
between
excellent
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
as
i
had
in
a
series
with
some
that
were
much
better
my
memory
is
a
little
skewed
and
my
notes
are
a
little
sloppy
at
the
time
i
thought
it
was
a
b
so
id
order
it
again
d
though
this
one
is
not
bad
there
are
so
many
better
stouts
out
there
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
poured
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
this
stout
appears
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
of
lingering
ecru
foam
notes
of
milk
chocolate
bittersweet
chocolate
vanilla
medium
roast
coffee
beans
mocha
a
hint
or
raisin
sweet
malt
the
stout
falls
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
bodied
and
is
adequately
carbonated
for
the
style
no
doubt
about
it
this
is
a
chocolaty
stout
tasty
stuff
this
would
be
a
good
candidate
for
a
nitro
tap
drinkability
not
too
bad
at
all
very
enjoyable
beer
with
a
body
that
doesnt
sit
like
a
brick
and
pretty
moderate
abv
this
is
pretty
close
to
a
sessionable
stout
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
good
chocolate
stout
and
isnt
overpowering
in
it
though
notes
despite
the
name
this
is
really
a
milk
stout
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
chocolate
specifically
fresh
cocoa
nibs
i
didnt
get
it
as
a
result
i
tried
to
rate
it
fairly
even
though
milk
stouts
are
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
drinks
fairly
easy
not
a
stout
i
could
pound
every
night
but
going
down
great
on
cool
april
fools
evening
nice
one
from
arcadia
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
slightly
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
decent
but
expected
a
bit
more
cocoachocolate
flavor
from
this
d
the
sweetness
does
become
a
bit
overwhelming
a
nice
desert
beer
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
1cm
brown
head
sweet
chocolaty
aroma
acidic
yet
sweet
chocolaty
flavor
moderate
mouthfeel
i
felt
like
the
slightly
sour
yes
somehow
it
was
sweet
and
sour
acidic
flavor
was
too
much
for
the
brew
and
tended
to
dominate
i
wouldnt
mind
smelling
this
beer
again
but
with
all
of
the
great
chocolate
stouts
out
there
id
probably
go
with
something
else
though
it
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
actual
quality
of
the
beer
i
would
like
to
note
that
the
label
of
the
person
going
mad
on
this
bottle
is
amongst
my
alltime
favorite
this
beer
was
a
nearlyopaque
dark
brownblack
color
the
twofingers
of
mochacolored
head
displayed
decent
retention
especially
as
a
skim
and
very
good
lacing
like
torn
sheets
the
aroma
was
full
of
milk
chocolate
cocoa
and
hints
of
coffee
and
earth
the
flavors
were
similar
starting
sweet
with
lots
of
milk
chocolate
dark
chocolate
notes
of
earth
and
coffee
in
the
middle
and
a
baking
chocolate
bitterness
on
the
finish
rather
onedimensional
but
if
you
like
chocolate
its
a
great
choice
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
medium
pours
an
opaque
dark
reddish
brown
black
away
from
the
light
but
some
dark
red
in
the
edges
very
thick
tan
head
forms
keeps
a
nice
layer
and
ring
great
retention
smell
is
okay
dry
and
toasty
cocoa
powder
raisins
caramel
sweetness
brown
sugar
light
roast
and
chocolate
malt
quite
fruity
but
not
as
much
going
on
as
i
would
like
bland
taste
is
very
milky
sweet
and
caramelized
toast
chocolate
roast
coffee
raisins
and
dark
fruit
chocolate
milk
and
coffee
very
dry
in
the
finish
lightly
sour
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
pretty
interesting
although
nothing
real
special
going
on
thanks
russ
d
pretty
good
i
suppose
especially
if
youre
a
coffee
fan
overall
a
tasty
stout
cheers
beertracker
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
one
ill
try
it
again
but
only
to
see
if
this
one
was
a
bad
one
if
it
tastes
the
same
ill
pour
it
out
and
get
something
else
i
finally
put
my
finger
on
the
aftertaste
and
the
smell
this
is
going
to
sound
weird
but
it
almost
like
a
brine
or
olives
not
something
i
want
in
my
beer
maybe
a
martini
but
not
my
beer
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
or
hoping
for
has
a
smooth
feel
that
compliments
the
style
one
major
downfall
for
this
beer
is
an
acidic
feel
that
leaves
it
sitting
heavy
in
your
stomach
it
gets
hard
to
drink
though
i
suppose
itd
be
easier
with
some
food
smooth
full
body
good
carbonation
nice
beer
could
not
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
will
try
again
next
year
and
maybe
sometime
in
between
overall
a
very
interesting
drinking
experience
pours
into
a
pint
an
inky
black
with
a
dirty
tan
head
thats
thin
but
lingering
the
head
boils
over
the
top
of
the
glass
no
matter
how
you
control
the
pour
or
clean
the
glass
deep
black
in
the
glass
with
almost
no
light
getting
through
nose
of
roasted
coffee
burnt
molasses
on
the
mouth
the
carbonation
rules
from
start
to
finish
flavors
are
of
bitter
chocolate
overroasted
coffee
and
black
strap
molasses
the
finish
is
brief
and
driven
by
the
zing
of
carbonation
pairs
well
with
hearty
rustic
fair
on
a
winter
evening
lacks
sufficient
balance
to
stand
out
in
a
crowded
stout
field
pours
a
deep
cloudy
brown
almost
black
with
a
thing
tan
head
smells
like
a
sweet
milk
stout
cant
pick
up
to
much
taste
is
big
not
a
heavy
bold
drink
but
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
i
can
definitely
pick
out
the
carmel
chocolate
and
milk
flavors
the
sweet
milk
comes
overtop
and
blend
all
the
flavors
together
well
a
good
creamy
mouthfeel
no
bitterness
and
good
drinkability
this
is
awful
down
the
drain
she
goes
hmmm
strange
taste
on
the
first
drink
starts
with
a
super
sweet
tang
and
metalic
flavor
then
a
strong
cocoamix
taste
comes
through
and
lingers
on
the
palate
sure
is
chalky
very
different
from
any
other
beer
i
have
had
mouthfeel
seems
to
be
thin
but
like
i
said
the
beer
sticks
around
even
after
you
think
its
gone
it
seems
to
stick
to
the
roof
of
your
mouth
and
gums
drinkability
is
not
high
given
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
crave
or
pick
this
up
again
finally
a
good
regular
stout
that
i
can
get
pretty
easily
d
very
drinkable
good
flavor
and
texture
not
much
coco
and
certainly
not
loco
with
coco
pours
a
two
finger
tan
head
that
leaves
a
good
lace
totally
black
color
molasses
nose
lightmedium
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
flavor
is
smooth
molasses
some
bakers
chocolate
at
finish
7

for
a
22
oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
overall
drinkability
is
about
average
cant
see
drinking
this
one
too
often
or
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
but
could
be
a
good
treat
d
goes
down
pretty
easy
not
one
to
have
a
lot
but
a
good
treat
taste
was
sort
of
a
let
down
from
the
smell
definitely
detected
cocoa
a
very
dry
cocoa
taste
not
as
sweet
as
i
thought
it
would
have
been
very
dry
and
i
must
say
i
did
like
the
fact
that
it
was
dry
this
stout
was
good
but
was
missing
something
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
maybe
a
touch
more
of
hops
needs
a
little
tinkering
and
this
could
be
a
very
good
stout
very
dark
chocolate
brown
in
color
with
reddish
tinted
maltshop
head
that
doesnt
stay
too
long
but
leaves
a
healthy
cap
and
some
thick
runny
lacing
huge
on
the
cocoa
in
the
scent
other
aromas
are
of
tootsie
rolls
a
really
warm
roasty
malt
more
than
a
dash
of
molasses
and
a
pinch
of
alcohol
the
flavor
and
feel
of
this
fuller
end
of
the
medium
scale
body
wise
beer
is
a
chocolate
malted
the
use
of
lactose
in
the
brewing
process
brings
out
a
creamy
quality
that
compliment
the
super
huge
rich
cocoa
flavors
melding
them
together
nicely
than
just
leaving
each
other
stand
apart
as
it
warms
it
does
take
on
some
bitter
dark
chocolate
characteristics
but
still
has
soothing
texture
all
the
way
down
the
aftertaste
has
a
some
warming
effect
from
the
alcohol
and
slight
bit
of
a
powered
chocolate
used
in
baking
but
has
a
silky
feeling
keeps
it
from
lingering
around
too
long
no
doubt
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
big
bottle
series
unfortunately
thats
not
saying
much
at
all
its
definitely
got
chocolate
but
its
the
dry
kind
youll
find
in
ommegangs
chocolate
indulgence
sweet
mother
of
malt
did
i
just
compare
these
two
beers
not
a
whole
lot
of
depth
or
complexity
to
this
one
just
a
lingering
rather
pleasant
sweetness
that
saves
what
is
otherwise
a

a

there
it

just
not

cant
beat
the

i
liked
it
alot
and
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
it
again
but
my

didnt
like
the
dry

but
he
doesnt
like
anything
remotely
bitter

with
a

center
and
a
bitter
roasted
coffee
finish
also
hints
of
toffee
and
caramel
overall
a
good
try
but
nowhere
near
thick
creamy
and
sweet
enough
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
sweet
lactose
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
complex
flavor
arrangement
that
boasts
of
chocolate
and
molasses
as
well
as
a
bit
of
milk
sugar
its
dry
with
a
nice
roasted
edge
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
chocolate
stout
its
beautiful
to
look
at
and
it
tastes
great
also
i
would
say
it
was
above
average
overall
but
not
great
very
rich
and
a
great
foam
very
similar
to
a
guinness
in
appearance
body
and
color
a
sweet
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
some
molasses
flavor
it
is
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
and
would
probably
go
well
for
just
sitting
around
with
some
friends
and
just
there
to
enjoy
the
flavor
of
a
good
beer
wouldnt
go
well
with
wings
or
nachos
or
anything
like
that
very
good
for
people
who
like
guinness
but
want
something
with
fuller
taste
and
a
bit
sweeter
notes
from
51107
tasted
a
bit
too
sweet
a
bit
similiar
to
southern
tier
creme
brulette
note
the
label
if
you
can
read
it
includes
lactose
and
molasses
there
was
a
cocoa
taste
and
aroma
as
well
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
and
oily
but
drinkable
overall
probable
better
on
tap
or
out
of
a
more
appropriate
serving
vessel
i
will
be
indulging
in
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
d
super
drinkable
and
nice
got
a
12oz
on
draft
and
it
was
perfect
really
great
beer
get
it
on
cask
if
you
can
12oz

from
the

in

maine
pours
an
opaque
black

with
a

film
of

smells
nutty
somewhat
chocolatey
maybe
some
banana
tastes
like
chocolate
for
sure

some

somewhat

some
vineousraisin
qualities
chocolate
dominates
though
supersmooth
medium
to
full
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
no
alcohol
apparent
anywhere
a
supertasty
wellcrafted
american
stout
one
i
have
difficulty
finding
much
wrong
with
very
good
definitely
one
ill
be
snagging
again
should
i
see
it
again
this
is
a
tasty
well
balanced
beer
the
chocolate
does
not
overwhelm
and
theres
just
enough
bitterness
to
ease
the
sweet
flavors
overall
a
very
different
beer
in
style
interesting
though
very
different
from
an
imperial
ale
as
it
is
listed
mouth
is
thick
and
oily
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
but
amooth
the
whole
way
down
suprisingly
good
because
the
bartender
just
gave
me
one
and
said
youll
like
this
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
stout
the
nice
chocolate
flavors
and
no
perceived
bitterness
made
this
extremely
drinkable
i
will
continue
to
buy
this
one
d
alcohol
is
quite
well
hidden
and
the
flavours
are
similar
to
some
other
brews
that
take
it
in
a
similar
direction
though
something
seems
to
be
missing
its
good
not
great
but
id
get
it
again
a
good
stout
although
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
give
it
a
try
if
youre
into
milkstouts
or
similar
ales
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
dark
dark
brown
that
let
no
light
pass
it
had
a
nice
2
finger
light
brown
hot
chocolate
colored
head
that
lingered
well
and
left
a
nice
ring
smell
reminded
me
of
a
sweet
mocha
or
possibly
a
hersheys
bar
taste
was
definitely
cocoa
with
a
bit
of
bread
almost
seemed
like
a
smore
wo
the
marshmallow
felt
bitter
and
acidic
in
the
mouth
and
was
a
little
watery
drank
fairly
well
for
an
imperial
stout
but
the
bitternessacidity
made
me
drink
it
even
slower
than
normal
d
this
has
complex
and
unique
flavors
and
isnt
over
the
top
powerful
body
a
bit
north
of
medium
creamy
and
slick
good
drinkability
alot
of
flavor
for
a
7
brew
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
for
a
double
stout
however
i
just
feel
this
is
not
a
big
enough
brew
while
very
enjoyable
as
it
is
i
prefer
my
doubleimperial
stouts
to
be
big
ugly
nasty
huge
flavored
beasts
drink
more
like
a
standard
stout
than
an
imperial
drinkability
ehh
d
real
easy
to
drink
one
i
would
love
to
have
again
it
would
probably
go

the
taste
is
an
abundance
of

roasted

the
beer
is
very
crisp
and
smooth
especially
for
the
style
making
it
very
enjoyable
even
on
a
hot
summer
night
worth
a
shot
d
great
beer
this
is
my
first
sample
from
arcadia
and
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
i
am
happily
supprised
tasted
on
51608
this
is
as
advertisedlots
of
cocoa
and
semisweet
chocolate
flavors
its
worth
trying
simply
because
it
is
such
a
pleasant
departure
from
the
style
id
love
to
try
it
against
other
big
chocolate
stoutsporters
deep
chocolate
colour
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
5
liter
glass
full
of
foam
just
too
frothy
taste
was
slightly
creamy
there
was
a
bitter
aroma
detected
here
this
is
not
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
and
it
left
me
disappointed
i
expected
a
more
chocolate
feel
i
also
detected
a
bitter
aftertaste
me
and
my
wife
had
dinner
arcadia
last
night
i
saw
on
the
board
that
there
was
a
double
imperial
chocolate
stout
being
served
and
i
nearly
creamed
my
pants
here
i
am
thinking
rogue
chocolate
stout
well
wow
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
been
so
disappointed
by
a
beer
the
appearance
was
nice
but
that
was
about
it
the
flavor
was
borderline
repulsive
drink
this
beer
next
to
a
rogue
chocolate
stout
and
tell
me
how
u
give
this
beer
anything
higher
than
a
c
the
mouthfeel
was
also
very
uncomfortable
calling
this
a
double
imperial
stout
is
travesty
it
tasted
more
like
a
skunked
milwaukees
best
with
food
coloring
in
it
seems
to
be
a
very
mild
hint
of
cinnamon
flavor
in
there
too
along
with
some
milk
chocolate
flavors
it
wasnt
as
sweet
as
i
had
expected
but
there
was
a
sweet
creamy
malt
thing
going
on
similar
to
an
irish
carbomb
the
creaminess
was
there
but
mild
doesnt
really
seem
much
like
it
belongs
in
the
is
category
but
its
still
decent
drinkability
this
is
okay
but
there
are
plenty
more
complex
tasty
stouts
to
be
had
it
is
kind
of
like
the
best
glass
of
soursemisweet
chocolate
milk
you
will
ever
have
that
is
not
a
put
down
either
just
very
unique
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
espresso
beans
and
cocoa
powder
first
sip
reveals
fine
tingly
carbonation
and
a
smooth
velvety
texture
flavor
is
roasted
malt
with
some
sweet
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
coffee
dryness
hints
of
molasses
and
general
sweet
malt
as
well
no
hop
presence
or
hints
of
abv
a
pretty
big
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
nice
well
crafted
beer
mfd
imo
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
a
stout
when
i
swirled
it
in
my
mouth
it
seemed
to
foam
up
like
crazy
i
enjoyed
the
aftertaste
i
only
wish
the
stout
tasted
more
like
it
worth
a
try
but
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
again
not
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
that
sourness
and
nose
burn
bugs
me
might
try
one
more
time
on
tap
mfd
this
beer
is
fairly
thin
for
a
stout
but
still
remained
creamy
it
coated
the
mouth
well
with
a
slightly
sticky
feel
and
left
behind
a
slight

this

something
i
would
recommend
spending
the

on
in

i
wouldnt

this
was
a
terrible

just
not

im
not

impressed
with
this
one
i
got
a
little
excited
when
i
saw
triple

on
the

but
really
this
is
just
your
run
of
the
mill
milk
stout
i
dont
know
why
its
classified
as
an
imperial
on
here
as
it
barely
resembles
any
imperial
stout
ive
ever
had
i
say
skip
this
one
unless
youre
a
big
fan
of

only
then
might
it
be
worth
trying
otherwise
not

not
as
flavorful
as
i
would
have
liked
but
decent
nonetheless
pretty
tasty
more
akin
to
an
export
stout
and
the
cocoa
adds
a
nice
twist
without
becoming
burdensome
a
pleasant
stout
with
unique
flavor
additions
however
this
tastes
much
more
like
a
sweet

than
a
doulbe

worth
a
try
anyway
despite
the

that

is
a
sweetness
that
at
times
was
a

surreal
maybe
that
was
the
lactose
it
struck
me
as
a

artificial
still
this
is
an
amazing
stout
with
layers

to
it

you
can

by

why
its

is
rather
bland
there
are
no
roated

hints
just
a
slight

a

of
the

i
think
they
canceled
each

out
and
didnt
leave
much
else
goes
down
all
right
for

chocolate
was
just
too
powerful
in
this
beer
the
lack

it
somewhat

cut

the
name
rather
than
the
loco
part
nice
beer
glad
i
picked
it
up
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
had
a
lot
of
sweetness
and
chocolate
with
just
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
the
flavor
was
filled
with
caramel
malts
and
cocoa
notes
along
with
a
hint
of
lactic
acid
very
smooth
and
tasty
drinks
very
well
for
the
alcohol
and
doesnt
seem
to
have
that
strong
of
a
punch
thick
bodied
as
well
very
nice
beer
but
much
more
subtle
and
downtoearth
than
i
expected
particularly
because
the
previously
drank
big
beers
by
arcadia
have
been
exceptional
the
beer
pours
a
viscous
dark
brown
color
with
some
chocolate
milklike
haze
and
an
airy
froth
that
laced
quite
well
the
aromas
were
light
and
again
took
on
milk
chocolate
notes
with
light
kona
coffee
roasted
malts
and
caramel
malts
the
flavors
are
rich
and
full
but
not
agressive
or
strong
by
any
means
the
cocoa
flavors
rise
above
the
coffee
nutty
malty
notes
light
bittering
only
offers
balance
for
the
sweetness
and
no
other
contributing
flavors
or
aromas
the
body
seems
full
and
round
but
not
heavy
or
weighted
at
all
remains
airy
finishes
quite
powdery
with
a
continuous
cocoa
flavor
very
nice
but
quite
mellow
tasting
and
feeling
for
a
bigger
beer
cheers
notes
not
a
bnd
brew
by
any
means
but
for
the
price
tag
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
many
stouts
both
in
and
out
of
the
imperial
category
that
blow
this
one
away
for
less
of
a
wallet
hit
poured
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
an
opaque
black
no
light
even
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
large
2
finger
fluffy
mocha
color
head
atop
that
settled
very
slowly
into
a
near
creamylike
mass
the
molasses
and
chocolate
used
in
this
brew
are
the
main
components
to
the
aromas
with
a
light
roasted
note
as
well
for
the
most
part
rather
light
aromas
lighter
mouthfeel
than
expected
for
a
bigger
stout
but
it
goes
down
pretty
easilyquite
dry
and
earthy
on
the
palate
the
molasses
imparts
a
light
sweetness
but
its
very
light
the
lactose
i
thought
would
provide
a
bit
more
sweetness
all
in
all
its
rather
dry
and
earthy
the
chocolate
is
there
in
essence
form
providing
a
little
depth
not
bad
but
could
much
better
this
brew
like
alot
of
arcadia
brews
meets
with
mixed
results
for
me
overall
i
was
surprised
at
how
light
bodied
this
beer
was
a
good
summer
time
stout
lots
of
new
interesting
flavors
but
it
seems
to
lack
character
and
depth
just
plain
pleasurable
dark
dark

burnt

with
a

odor
ok
flavordecent
blend
of

but
nothing
stands
out
one
way
or
another
somewhat
dry
and
astringent
tasting
ok
bodycould
use
a
kick
in
the
pants
when
it
comes
to
the
mouthfeel
departmentrather
thin
for
a
double
stout
no
big
deal
overall
i
was
more
impressed
with
the
label
then
the
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
inspiring
it
suffers
from
that
acridity
i
would
not
have
it
too
often
pours
an
opague
thin
motor
oil
with
a
tan
head
that
fell
quickly
to
a
slight
layer
of
bubbles
with
a
little
lacing
after
the
pour
it
smelled
good
but
once
the
head
fell
i
lost
the
chocolate
scent
roasted
malt
molasses
and
a
hint
of
coffee
lingers
its
smooth
on
the
way
down
and
finishes
a
little
dry
with
minimal
hop
taste
and
aroma
its
dinkable
but
not
sessionable
nice
dark
black
coloring
with
brown
red
edges
and
a
thin
head
of
cocoa
the
smell
is
of
a
stout
but
were
is
the
chocolate
loco
means
crazy
right
well
the
lack
of
a
crazy
chocolatelike
aroma
leads
to
big
no
real
taste
of
chocolate
i
couldnt
taste
the
choclate
either
and
the
beer
was
so
thin
it
reminds
me
of
kate
moss
looks
can
be
deceiving
and
this
one
really
leaves
me
scratching
my
head
i
really
love
the
regular
brews
from
arcadia
but
the
big
beer
series
is
mostly
junk
i
hope
the
start
over
drinkability
decent
not
an
overpowering
double
stout
almost
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
but
in
no
way
is
thin
bodied
not
bad
i
would
probably
have
this
one
again
in
the
future
drinkability
meh
its
really
not
that
interesting
that
said
its
pretty
drinkable
since
the
flavors
arent
that
aggressive
could
work
as
a
crosssover
to
the
dark
side
kinda
like
killing
sandpeople
not
a
double
stout
by
any
means
flavors
arent
in
your
face
and
really
fade
into
the
background
i
can
buy
a
6
pack
of
mackeson
xxx
stout
which
is
a
much
better
beer
for
the
cost
of
one
of
these
not
worth
it
imo
mouth
is
bitter
bitter
dark
chocolate
mediumfull

i
dont
know
if
im
loco
about
the
label
on
this
22
oz
bottle
pours
an
anticipated
dark
dark

nearly

brown
head
settles
quickly
to
a
ring
of
foam
nose
of
roasted

dark
coffee
peppery
spice
and
dark
chocolate
the
chocolate
aroma
is
on
the
bitter
side
with
a
light
hersheys
syrup
sweetness
pretty
good
light
roasted
malt
flavors
greet
the
tongue
followed
by
a
milky
sweetness
hints
of
sweet
chocolate
mix
with
singed
fruits
and
coffee
swampy
staleish
finish
is
disappointing
after
a
decent
beginning
roasted
bitterness
in
the
background
but
the
swampy
cardboardplastic
is
unavoidable
doesnt
taste
infected
but
just
off
maybe
its
from
the
chocolate
i
dont
know
mediumbodied
with
a
chalky
finish
would
be
a
nice
beer
if
the
finish
wasnt
off
overall
this
is
an
ok
chocolate
stout
quite
frankly
there
are
far
better
versions
youngs
brooklyns
rogues
but
this
is
worth
a
try
if
youve
had
the
others
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
a
very
gentle
carbonation
still
seems
watery
which
is
weird
considering
the
body
not
something
ill
ever
want
to
try
again
though
actually
it
is
too
big
for
me
alone
right
now
oof
should
have
saved
it
for
my
next
hot
date
or
something
now
its
kicking
in
dgood
but
not
the
best
chocolate
stout
i
have
had
drinkable
enough
quite
sticky
and
a
bit
out
of
sync
but
a
decent
attempt
if
this
does
indeed
turn
into
an
annual
as
the
bottle
indicates
ill
be
curious
to
see
if
it
improves
being
what
it
currently
is
though
im
not
sure
its
worth
the
price
of
admission
not
a
bad
beer
slightly
acidic
light
bodied
tastes
a
bit
watered
down
a
standard
wellexecuted
american
stout
no
bells
and
whistles
of
impy
or
what
have
you
but
quite
a
tasty
dark
beer
loaded
with
flavor
for
5
75
moderateheavy
coffee
moderate
dark
fruits
light
chocolate
medium
body
finishes
somewhat
dry
insanely
drinkable
and
refreshing
will
be
getting
this
again
its
cheap
good
job
as
always
ng
on
tap
at
brews
brothers
typical
stout
aroma
nice
dark
color
some
coffee
flavors
its
ok
had
higher
hopes
i
think
its
good
but
ive
if
much
better
coffee
stouts
overall
this
brew
is
kind
if
a
miss
there
is
not
much
taste
to
this
one
o
a
bit
one
note
and
too
dry
for
my
likes
a
rare
new
glarus
miss
for
me
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
combines
excellent
balance
with
an
understated
sophistication
i
rate
it
as
comparable
to
founders
breakfast
stout
though
the
two
are
quite
distinct
o
an
english
oriented
stout
almost
porter
like
with
a
mild
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
that
would
be
something
that
could
be
drank
quantity
i
expected
this
coffee
stout
to
be
bigger
and
more
chocolateroast
forward
this
isnt
that
not
really
my
thing
but
i
could
see
this
going
over
well
with
someone
that
isnt
typically
a
stout
fan
very
drinkable
as
an
after
dinner
drink
i
could
drink
this
at
any
point
in
the
year
because
of
how
light
it
feels
while
drinking
o
a
solid
drinkable
stout
that
i
could
and
will
proceed
to
session
this
would
make
an
interesting
imperial
stout
if
it
was
beefed
up
come
to
think
of
it
when
is
the
last
time
new
glarus
made
anything
stoutrelated
on
the
thumbprint
series
it
would
be
nice
to
see
them
go
nuts
and
make
a
monster
stout
overall
highly
recommended
o
a
nice
light
stout
that
has
some
porter
like
characteristics
and
worth
trying
again
reminds
me
of
another
light
coffee
stout
that
i
enjoy
and
that
is
fuel
cafe
from
lakefront
brewery
also
from
wisconsin
the
beer
tastes
almost
nothing
like
coffee
nor
stout
but
intstead
literally
like
a
porter
and
for
that
it
is
a
good
one
at
that
if
one
wants
their
roasted
malt
fix
at
a
smaller
abv
then
this
is
a
very
good
brew
o
as
i
finish
this
first
bottle
i
realize
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
different
than
my
first
impression
i
think
this
is
more
for
the
icedcoffee
lover
than
the
stout
lover
this
bottle
has
been
sitting
around
for
while
and
its
finally
time
to
give
it
a
try
too
bad
i
waited
because
this
is
a
nice
brew
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
decentsized
ecru
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
a
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
character
not
much
of
a
hops
presence
to
of
the
beer
is
so
smooth
velvety
its
almost
like
a
chocolate
liqueur
but
much
better
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
malt
are
at
the
forefront
as
the
collective
entity
moves
rearward
the
bitterness
from
the
roasted
malt
is
nicely
complemented
by
subtle
hops
presence
deep
rich
and
very
tasty
o
simple
delicious
and
a
great
price
when
you
want
a
lighter
tasty
coffee
stout
this
one
hits
the
spot
o
underwhelmed
by
this
one
the
smelltaste
lack
complexity
and
the
body
is
too
thin
please
drink
this
near
room
temperature
where
this
beer
really
shines
its
heavy
with
the
coffee
yet
not
onedimensional
a
wonderfully
complex
balanced
smooth
brew
very
welldone
exceptionally
enjoyable
i
hate
stouts
absolutely
hate
them
but
this
beer
was
awesome
in
full
disclosure
i
just
opened
a
20122013
coffee
stout
that
i
had
stored
in
my
beer
refrigerator
since
last
season
it
didnt
miss
a
beat
i
dont
drink
coffee
anymore
but
this
beer
has
the
perfect
mixture
of
coffee
flavor
and
beer
qualities
they
didnt
overdo
the
coffeeness
like
so
many
other
brewers
do
when
making
a
coffee
beer
i
enjoy
almost
all
ng
beers
especially
their
fruit
beers
i
like
to
think
they
are
the
best
at
flavored
beers
in
general
and
their
normal
beers
arent
far
behind
cheers
certainly
not
the
most
aggressive
coffee
stout
bottle
from
trade
pours
deep
brown
with
a
one
finger
kahki
head
that
recedes
quickly
earthy
coffe
and
roasty
malt
aroma
with
some
hop
presence
flavor
is
lots
of
coffee
and
roasty
smokey
goodness
really
easy
drinking
and
relatively
high
carbonation
dry
finish
and
a
bit
of
bite
at
the
end
good
stuff
a
stout
you
could
drink
all
day
but
not
sure
i
would
put
it
in
the
sweet
stout
category
like
it
is
here
closer
to
a
porter
than
to
sweet
o
this
was
a
decent
beer
for
a
6
coffee
stout
however
like
i
mentioned
the
stout
side
could
have
come
out
a
little
bit
more
with
the
coffee
being
a
little
bit
bolder
drank
a
little
bit
more
like
a
coffee
flavored
ale
then
a
coffee
stout
despite
that
being
said
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
still
enjoyed
trying
it
o
an
easydrinking
coffee
stout
thats
pretty
light
on
the
coffee
o
creative
take
on
an
already
good
style
crisp
and
clean
are
not
word
usually
associated
with
coffee
stouts
but
new
glarus
has
a
way
of
making
seemingly
questionable
combinations
delicious
mine
was
poured
into
a
new
glarus
flutelike
pint
glass
that
i
got
from
the
brewerys
sampling
garden
recommended
but
not
a
must
find
thanks
for
sharing
oa
solid
stout
with
decent
flavor
probably
new
glaruss
least
impressive
beer
just
does
not
deliver
the
coffee
and
the
base
stout
is
not
that
impressive
either
good
flavor
light
body
this
is
a
good
beer
o
the
malt
taste
skips
pretty
much
all
intermittent
crystal
malts
and
goes
right
for
chocolate
malts
leaving
a
onedimensional
flavor
sometimes
you
get
a
coffee
stout
that
seems
to
consist
of
diner
coffee
in
this
case
the
coffee
is
distinguishable
and
yet
smooth
with
no
harsh
bitterness
pleasant
body
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
and
the
nose
was
a
little
understated
i
recommend
drinking
this
beer
as
absolutely
fresh
as
possible
ive
had
this
beer
around
for
a
little
while
and
it
seems
to
diminish
quickly
with
age
m
big
medium
leading
to
full
good
carbonation
makes
it
feel
lighter
b
overall
an
excellent
beer
another
nicely
done
to
new
glarus
on
wisconsin
o
out
of
the
bottle
seemed
poised
to
amaze
aromas
were
ridiculous
gotta
say
it
came
up
a
little
short
on
the
finish
nice
beer
just
ended
up
a
little
too
one
note
in
the
end
to
be
spectacular
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
but
its
unfortunately
pretty
average
enjoyable
but
pretty
average
o
easy
drinking
stout
tasty
but
nothing
too
special
overall
this
coffee
stout
comes
off
as
a
safe
and
easydrinking
stout
with
little
in
the
way
of
complexity
or
nuance
not
quite
coffee
enough
for
a
coffee
fan
or
stout
enough
for
a
stout
fan
i
cant
help
but
feel
a
little
underwhelmed
in
spite
of
this
brews
adequacy
o
i
liked
this
beer
i
will
probably
not
seek
it
out
again
as
there
are
just
so
many
other
coffee
beers
out
there
that
are
more
pleasing
to
my
palate
there
is
something
about
this
one
that
seems
artificiallike
herseys
syrup
in
dunkin
donuts
coffee
counterintuitive
as
i
know
new
glarus
cares
a
whole
lot
more
than
that
hmm
o
if
this
beer
was
billed
as
a
vanilla
porter
i
would
have
given
it
better
marks
but
instead
i
ended
up
being
very
disappointed
and
sad
to
say
this
was
the
first
craft
beer
i
poured
down
the
drain
coffee
stouts
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
unfortunately
this
beer
fell
flat
for
me
i
have
great
respect
for
ng
especially
their
fruit
beers
maybe
this
was
a
bad
bottle
and
a
second
try
will
be
better
the
best
coffee
stout
ive
ever
had
should
be
a
yearround
brew
now
i
need
to
speed
back
to
wisco
and
pick
up
a
couple
more
sixpacks
an
excellent
stout
wish
this
wasnt
a
seasonal
but
hey
im
glad
i
have
a
steady
trade
buddy
to
send
me
full
packs
of
stuff
like
this
randomly
o
a
decent
but
in
no
way
extraordinary
beer
o
overall
the
coffee
in
this
beer
is
definitely
reminiscent
of
breakfast
stout
and
joe
mamas
milk
and
other
coffee
stouts
that
i
dig
but
the
body
is
lacking
watery
and
fizzy
at
the
same
time
good
just
not
great
id
have
it
again
but
wont
actively
seek
it
out
o
overall
a
solid
american
stout
some
nice
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
though
it
is
light
on
the
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
thin
for
a
stout
but
worth
trying
would
have
it
again
overall
very
easy
to
drink
very
easy
to
acquire
and
the
price
is
right
at
6
99
for
a
6pack
its
what
you
expect
from
new
glarus
well
balanced
wellput
together
and
true
to
the
style
at
a
price
thats
nothing
but
right
its
essentially
a
welldone
stout
put
together
with
coffee
coffee
drinkers
who
drink
the
occasional
beer
will
enjoy
it
and
vice
versa
4
overall
i
have
drank
a
few
bottles
of
this
beer
yearly
and
never
reviewed
it
honestly
i
forgot
how
enjoyable
this
new
glarus
beer
really
is
every
single
year
wow
i
almost
always
love
every
ng
beer
they
put
out
for
us
here
in
wi
but
this
one
is
a
step
above
most
if
you
are
a
coffee
beer
fan
either
trade
for
it
or
if
you
are
here
in
wi
then
just
buy
it
o
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
by
new
glarus
hits
the
spot
everytime
new
glarus
puts
out
fantastic
beer
and
this
take
on
a
coffee
stout
is
phenomena
simply
outstanding
i
have
yet
to
have
anything
from
new
glarus
that
is
anything
short
of
pure
talented
excellence
look
forward
t
making
a
trip
up
there
soon
overall
a
pretty
solid
coffee
beer
definitely
not
thick
like
an
imperial
stout
its
more
like
a
sweetmilk
stout
but
a
pretty
good
one
honestly
ill
take
this
over
founders
breakfast
stout
way
more
balanced
overall
definitly
a
1
dimensional
beer
that
lacks
balance
and
complexity
o
this
is
a
fantastic
coffee
stout
and
you
certainly
cant
beat
the
price
of
a
six
pack
glad
to
recommend
this
beer
better
than
most
coffee
stouts
not
overly
acrid
and
good
chocolatey
flavor
drinks
very
easily
and
chock
full
of
flavor
i
wish
more
of
the
coffee
was
here
but
the
overall
product
is
still
wonderful
chris
lemke
of
wisconsinbrewreview
com
o
ive
been
waiting
for
this
one
to
come
back
and
im
glad
its
here
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
coffee
stout
incredible
balance
and
feel
will
definitely
stock
up
on
this
one
especially
at
this
price
point
beer
pours
a
dark
brownnearly
black
with
a
medium
tan
head
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
coffee
and
chocolate
pretty
nice
the
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
after
the
nice
smell
its
pretty
one
dimensional
with
coffee
and
not
much
else
backing
it
up
beer
isnt
overly
roasty
or
sweet
and
doesnt
have
much
of
the
chocolate
that
i
got
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
the
style
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
okay
coffee
stout
that
is
far
from
bad
but
isnt
really
all
that
spectacular
either
its
simple
and
very
coffeeforward
o
very
drinkable
but
no
breakfast
stout
o
a
very
good
coffee
stout
very
drinkable
and
almost
sessionable
for
a
stout
the
coffee
flavor
is
very
nice
and
mild
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
cofee
stouts
and
the
mouthfeel
isnt
nearly
as
creamy
and
heavy
very
nice
for
an
after
dinner
beer
or
a
beer
to
go
along
with
desert
i
would
definetly
get
this
again
if
i
can
truely
a
perfect
cofee
stout
o
this
is
a
great
coffee
stout
its
under
appreciated
and
possibly
one
of
the
best
coffee
beers
on
the
market
id
drink
this
brew
all
the
time
if
i
could
get
a
hold
of
it
pours
a
solid
black
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
cap
and
leaves
spotty
lace
on
the
way
down
smells
of
coffee
chocolate
caramel
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
lactose
taste
is
mildly
roasty
with
a
coffee
edge
chocolate
caramel
vanilla
a
hint
of
smoke
all
play
supporting
roles
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
sugary
mouthfeel
nice
easy
drinking
stout
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
maybe
not
work
the
three
years
i
waited
for
it
but
good
just
the
same
overall
great
coffee
beer
subtle
less
is
more
the
two
things
that
i
liked
best
about
this
beer
were
the
smell
and
the
taste
although
it
had
a
nice
strong
coffee
tastesmell
there
was
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
to
make
it
a
little
more
interesting
and
to
make
it
feel
like
you
werent
just
drinking
a
cup
of
coffee
i
wish
the
abv
was
higher
but
it
was
still
solid
this
is
a
nice
coffee
stout
its
definitely
on
the
thin
side
both
in
feel
and
in
flavor
but
its
good
all
around
and
definitely
worth
drinking
o
a
pretty
good
beer
gotta
love
new
glarus
beer
is
thin
and
light
on
the
coffee
it
is
not
very
sweet
not
very
bitter
not
very
much
of
anything
this
is
a
plain
stout
in
my
opinion
nothing
else
moving
on
do
honestly
i
dont
know
how
i
got
this
old
of
a
bottle
i
could
have
swore
i
got
this
specific
one
at
the
brewery
a
month
ago
either
way
tasted
pretty
similar
to
a
fresh
one
so
im
reviewing
it
as
such
pretty
sessionable
coffee
stout
if
there
ever
was
one
could
be
usedseen
as
a
good
gateway
beer
bottle
from
reillys
in
madison
shared
with
chris
substantial
coffee
taste
and
aroma
good
think
its
very
good
coffee
some
cocoa
to
make
it
go
down
and
impart
sweetness
a
bit
light
mouthfeel
very
lacey
carbonation
right
there
good
drinkability
good
after
dinner
beer
the
smell
and
taste
were
on
the
appearance
and
mouth
feel
brought
it
down
not
the
best
coffee
beer
i
had
but
a
solid
offering
a
totally
fine
very
drinkable
and
unremarkable
stout
from
new
glarus
a
little
more
coffee
would
really
push
this
to
a
new
level
for
me
skål
great
stout
and
its
way
different
than
their
road
sludge
different
flavor
profile
makes
this
one
interesting
and
not
just
another
coffee
stout
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
expected
with
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
there
is
a
slight
film
left
on
the
inside
of
your
mouth
but
it
disappears
quickly
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
by
far
not
the
best
stout
ive
experienced
the
coffee
flavor
adds
a
nice
note
for
drinking
in
the
morning
but
just
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
overall
stouts
arent
my
favorite
style
yet
i
do
enjoy
a
good
one
from
time
to
time
this
is
a
pretty
decent
stout
not
mindblowing
but
satisfying
i
would
possibly
purchase
again
not
the
best
coffee
beer
ive
sampled
but
certainly
a
decent
example
that
i
will
be
drinking
again
appearance
is
lacking
some
of
those
robust
stout
qualities
and
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
otherwise
a
good
offering
from
one
hell
of
a
brewery
loved
it
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
to
date
big
thanks
goes
out
to
branimal9
for
sharing
this
one
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
deep
red
brown
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
coffee
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
caramel
cream
and
coffee
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
nothing
on
this
one
really
stood
out
to
me
if
im
honest
the
flavors
and
aromas
were
pleasant
but
not
overly
exciting
for
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
i
did
enjoy
the
touch
of
cream
in
the
flavor
though
definitely
worth
trying
at
least
once
though
as
it
might
surprise
you
overall
this
bottle
is
over
a
year
old
and
ive
never
had
a
fresh
one
so
its
hard
for
me
to
say
anything
about
how
the
beer
has
aged
regardless
while
the
flavors
were
somewhat
mild
i
thought
what
i
had
here
was
a
very
complex
and
interesting
coffee
stout
that
tells
a
story
as
it
goes
down
couple
that
with
a
very
light
and
creamy
body
and
this
one
is
extremely
drinkable
as
well
good
stuff
thanks
again
dlucky
o
a
pleasant
stout
nice
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
id
have
another
one
notes
nice
coffee
stout
that
is
heavy
on
coffee
flavors
but
has
enough
other
flavors
to
balance
it
out
nice
balance
between
sweet
bitter
and
astringent
coffee
aspects
body
is
the
only
aspect
not
up
to
snuff
o
a
very
well
balanced
beer
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
coffee
but
still
a
very
well
done
beer
drinkability
high
quality
stout
no
doubt
as
the
first
pint
emptied
i
think
i
got
over
my
qualm
about
the
mouthfeel
o
nice
easy
drinking
coffee
stout
doesnt
wow
me
but
still
a
good
beer
o
im
normally
not
a
huge
fan
of
coffee
stouts
but
this
one
was
very
enjoyable
d
this
is
a
coffee
beer
that
is
really
easy
to
drink
thanks
to
the
lack
of
harsh
acidity
or
palateraping
bitterness
if
youre
looking
for
a
lighter
stout
with
some
coffee
kick
to
it
this
is
a
fine
choice
im
told
the
coffee
new
glarus
uses
varies
so
i
expect
theres
some
variation
from
batchtobatch
still
another
wellcrafted
brew
from
new
glarus
do
this
coffee
stout
serves
ably
as
a
porterstyle
ale
for
all
occasions
thanks
to
its
coffee
qualities
being
kept
in
check
overall
flavor
and
smell
is
found
to
be
in
copacetic
agreement
suggesting
cookies
to
the
drinker
opaque
dark
brown
in
the
glass
topped
by
a
lighter
offwhite
head
that
lasts
great
aroma
grainy
at
the
forefront
along
with
coffee
toasted
malt
and
cream
smells
semisweet
and
the
coffee
is
nicely
integrated
rather
than
dominant
tastes
close
to
the
aroma
quite
malty
and
grainy
coffee
with
cream
at
an
even
balance
with
the
other
flavors
mediumbodied
lightly
sweet
in
the
finish
and
only
mildly
bitter
great
stuff
id
drink
this
regularly
if
it
were
locally
available
overall
i
really
like
this
brew
its
best
fresh
but
isnt
terrible
if
it
has
a
bit
of
age
a
nice
light
coffee
stout
that
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
face
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
not
quite
the
best
in
the
style
but
its
a
decent
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
not
great
but
id
definitely
drink
this
again
o
a
nice
coffee
stout
very
easy
to
drink
and
reminds
me
of
a
coffee
milk
stout
due
to
the
creaminess
and
milk
chocolate
enjoyed
this
one
the
low
abv
is
a
perk
due
to
most
coffee
bombs
hitting
at
8
overall
a
good
beer
i
would
seek
this
out
again
but
i
agree
with
some
of
the
criticism
that
it
is
a
little
light
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
solid
approach
to
the
style
id
certainly
love
to
get
my
hands
on
one
of
these
fresh
to
maximize
on
the
coffee
aromatics
and
flavors
o
i
am
hung
up
on
this
misnomer
but
the
brew
is
decent
though
quite
underwhelming
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
and
ends
black
with
two
fingers
if
light
tan
head
the
nose
has
light
coffee
notes
but
is
quite
faint
an
odd
sour
scent
is
noticed
the
taste
is
malty
and
tinted
with
coffee
the
coffee
bean
taste
lingers
for
quite
some
time
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
level
if
carbonation
not
too
sure
this
one
is
that
fresh
due
to
faint
characteristics
but
its
okay
either
way
love
chad
o
pretty
good
but
nothing
outstanding
o
a
little
too
dry
light
bubbly
coffee
is
subdued
and
burnt
reveal
new
glarus
coffee
stout
shut
the
front
door
this
had
coffee
infused
into
it
this
beer
the
one
right
in
front
me
lemme
take
another
sip
ya
no
barely
a
coffee
tone
on
it
i
can
see
some
of
the
roast
and
bitterness
being
coffeerelated
but
i
would
never
have
guessed
that
off
of
the
flavor
they
present
b
up
for
review
is
a
bottle
of
coffee
stout
from
new
glarus
poured
into
a
pint
glass
at
room
temp
nice
dark
pour
thin
head
well
balanced
coffee
presence
over
a
hearty
stout
not
too
much
coffee
which
is
nice
medium
body
is
a
bit
light
but
drinks
well
black
body
with
dark
brown
edges
significant
small
bead
head
tan
in
color
recedes
quickly
leaving
slight
lace
this
one
smells
of
coffee
caramel
bitter
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
follows
suit
with
notes
of
black
coffee
bitter
chocolate
caramel
and
roasted
malt
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
this
was
a
great
coffee
beer
and
my
first
offering
from
new
glarus
ill
be
back
have
not
met
a
ng
beer
that
let
me
down
yet
a
very
easy
drinking
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
would
revisit
o
a
solid
stout
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
o
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
session
stout
if
you
like
an
easy
beer
that
you
can
put
down
a
few
and
like
roasty
dark
beers
this
is
for
you
try
if
you
like
session
stouts
top
of
the
line
for
a
session
stout
right
now
i
am
really
into
stouts
and
i
love
new
glarus
so
my
review
may
be
a
little
biased
i
just
think
this
is
such
a
stellar
brew
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
i
have
experienced
taste
shows
a
bit
more
roast
but
has
a
nice
sweetness
to
give
it
a
bit
of
a
mocha
character
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
is
excellent
delicioso
one
of
the
best
coffee
stouts
i
have
ever
had
well
balanced
d
definitely
go
back
to
this
one
as
a
great
stout
tasty
stuff
really
glad
this
fell
into
my
lap
nice
coffee
notes
and
very
drinkable
with
the
less
than
5
abv
i
grew
up
10
minutes
away
from
southern
wisconsin
but
wasnt
of
drinking
age
when
we
moved
so
it
is
nice
to
get
a
taste
of
what
ive
been
missing
thanks
to
pitmonkey
for
the
extra
unfortunately
i
am
not
a
coffee
drinker
and
not
a
big
fan
of
it
either
hence
the
lower
ranking
poured
from
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
the
pour
is
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
rather
thin
tan
colored
head
the
nose
offers
up
a
decent
stout
aroma
with
notes
of
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
acidity
picks
up
some
coffee
theres
some
nice
roast
and
nutty
qualities
to
the
flavor
with
the
same
caramel
sweetness
the
body
is
the
usual
medium
maybe
a
touch
on
the
thin
side
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
but
not
my
style
overall
a
very
pleasant
coffee
stout
aromas
are
nice
as
is
the
taste
its
not
stellar
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
available
to
me
on
the
regular
pours
a
spot
on
cola
brown
with
a
fluffy
head
that
leaves
no
noticable
lacing
nice
notes
of
smoky
roasted
grain
chicory
coffee
dusty
wood
and
coffee
berries
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
diluted
though
some
nice
coffee
and
dark
red
fruits
come
out
also
a
touch
of
fruity
caramel
and
some
foresty
hops
shows
up
at
the
end
my
first
new
glarus
good
for
what
it
is
but
not
overly
impressed
o
pretty
happy
with
this
one
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
coffee
flavor
but
all
in
all
pretty
good
the
toasted
malt
is
quite
nice
and
the
bitterness
from
the
coffee
is
welcomed
nice
skal
pours
dark
black
with
a
large
foamy
light
tan
head
that
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
a
full
bodied
stout
with
a
good
amount
of
roasted
coffees
beans
taste
is
a
well
rounded
dark
roast
coffee
flavour
creamy
on
the
palate
nove
dark
malts
compliment
the
cocoa
and
java
notes
a
full
bodied
stout
that
uses
a
strong
coffee
profile
for
an
expected
taste
profile
one
of
the
better
and
decent
coffee
infused
stouts
ice
had
overall
not
the
best
new
glarus
offering
ive
had
taste
coffee
not
as
pronounced
o
a
pretty
middle
of
the
pack
coffee
stout
i
am
sure
the
coffee
they
infused
into
the
beer
was
of
high
quality
i
just
wish
i
could
taste
more
of
it
bottle
picked
up
on
my
last
run
to
hudson
wi
poured
into
a
dfh
tulip
a
pretty
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
12
finger
head
of
mocha
tan
head
settles
to
slight
collar
around
the
glass
mediumdark
roast
coffee
notes
in
the
nose
along
with
some
chocolate
this
is
not
the
most
coffee
coffee
stout
i
have
had
but
it
drinks
nice
it
has
a
sublte
sweetness
in
the
beginning
with
a
roasted
coffee
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
ends
with
a
mixture
of
roast
bitter
and
sweet
slightly
dry
i
felt
that
this
stout
was
surprisingly
sweet
more
oatmeal
stout
than
coffee
stout
in
fact
there
was
very
little
coffee
to
be
found
overall
its
a
pretty
average
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
not
too
far
off
the
average
for
a
5
75
stout
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
this
is
a
very
approachable
and
drinkable
coffee
stout
for
my
money
id
take
this
over
any
other
coffee
stout
ive
had
to
date
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
a
relatively
low
abv
thin
body
and
fresh
coffee
taste
gives
it
great
upside
with
no
downside
o
a
bit
dissapointed
by
this
one
since
its
not
a
double
stout
i
wasnt
expecting
the
massive
flavor
profile
for
some
others
but
this
just
came
up
a
bit
short
in
all
areas
overall
the
beer
doesnt
really
come
together
for
me
flavors
not
integrated
well
and
i
get
an
old
drip
coffee
aftertaste
that
lingers
ill
attribute
this
to
age
and
rereview
with
a
fresh
bottle
when
time
allows
id
never
say
no
to
a
bottle
of
new
glarus
and
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
this
d
the
first
beer
i
had
out
of
this
six
pack
i
couldnt
taste
the
coffee
at
all
but
that
beer
had
been
in
the
fridge
for
a
couple
of
days
this
one
was
barely
chilled
probably
around
55f
drink
this
beer
on
the
warm
side
if
you
want
to
taste
the
coffee
if
you
cant
stand
drinking
your
beer
that
warm
then
you
might
as
well
buy
something
else
since
you
wont
taste
the
coffee
anyway
i
think
i
still
like
coffee
bender
better
but
this
is
still
one
of
the
best
coffee
beers
i
have
had
d
because
it
actually
does
taste
like
very
good
coffee
i
cant
say
id
want
more
than
2
or
3
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
i
think
i
could
drink
that
many
every
day
i
wish
i
had
more
of
them
thanks
joseph
this
was
tasty
thanks
to
wisconsinbeer1
for
letting
me
try
this
great
brewery
for
the
first
time
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
skimpy
for
a
stout
but
the
carbonation
comes
across
as
creamy
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
and
i
like
that
in
a
coffee
stout
d
a
very
good
coffee
stout
would
get
this
one
again
if
it
were
available
near
me
101st
taste
is
pretty
balanced
with
a
medium
coffee
taste
and
some
creaminess
a
little
sweet
yet
bitter
interesting
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
but
a
nice
drinkable
stout
this
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
very
little
head
that
disapated
very
quickly
there
is
a
coffe
aroma
but
it
is
weak
the
taste
starts
malty
then
the
coffee
flavors
show
up
at
the
end
a
nice
strong
overall
flavor
but
lacking
just
a
bit
of
the
coffee
overall
a
real
nice
taste
and
nice
blend
with
the
coffee
it
isnt
over
powering
its
overall
pretty
good
and
would
have
another
d
if
i
had
a
six
pack
of
this
i
would
have
no
problems
drinking
it
in
one
sitting
as
this
has
a
lot
of
the
notes
that
i
really
enjoy
in
an
imperial
stout
toned
down
to
a
single
stout
very
nicely
done
minus
the
wet
dog
smell
in
the
nose
pours
black
with
some
amber
hues
similar
to
regular
coffee
had
a
1
finger
whitebrown
head
the
smell
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
with
sweetburnt
sugar
and
coffee
overtones
that
are
so
appealing
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
however
for
a
beer
that
is
less
than
6
i
found
it
a
bit
harsh
on
the
palate
it
seemed
a
little
off
balance
between
the
coffee
and
the
malts
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
silky
smooth
and
it
was
not
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
however
i
would
probably
lean
towards
some
other
coffee
stouts
especially
since
this
one
is
not
easily
accessible
for
me
d
this
would
be
one
that
i
would
recommend
to
others
the
flavors
are
key
and
the
drinkability
is
great
slight
deduction
of
points
due
to
the
light
body
which
would
in
turn
bring
the
drinkability
up
d
an
all
around
great
beer
for
the
coffee
lover
drink
at
around
room
temperature
and
be
ready
for
a
treat
this
is
the
first
new
glarus
product
that
ive
truly
enjoyed
and
could
see
myself
buying
in
a
pinch
tried
to
make
a
black
and
tan
with
the
little
king
cream
ale
but
did
not
get
separation
still
the
combo
was
very
nice
ok
beer
but
no
where
near
the
best
coffee
stout
ive
had
worth
trying
though
d
i
know
this
doesnt
fit
the
traditional
definition
of
a
session
ale
i
think
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
it
didnt
exhaust
my
palate
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
drinkability
was
average
i
dont
know
that
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
know
some
people
would
like
it
it
has
the
creamy
feel
youd
expect
from
a
stout
all
in
all
a
refined
example
of
the
style
the
looks
to
this
beer
was
just
average
to
me
the
body
is
pretty
dark
and
the
head
was
near
white
and
left
within
a
couple
minutes
with
my
stout
i
really
look
for
a
good
head
retention
the
smell
was
delicious
chocolatey
coffee
fills
the
nose
and
alot
of
malt
hit
you
right
away
the
best
thing
about
the
beer
in
my
opinion
the
taste
was
good
but
not
a
ton
of
flavor
i
would
expect
more
the
mouthfeel
hit
me
as
a
little
light
with
tons
of
carbonation
almost
the
mouthfeel
of
a
lager
or
ale
the
drinkability
of
this
one
is
high
i
have
come
to
realize
i
rate
the
drinkibility
on
if
i
can
drink
a
bunch
of
it
and
with
this
beer
i
can
but
i
kinda
dont
want
that
in
my
stouts
i
enjoy
thick
filling
stouts
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
liked
it
but
it
was
different
then
i
expected
the
sweetness
reminded
me
of
a
milk
stout
a
bit
the
coffee
was
fairly
light
compared
to
most
coffee
stouts
but
added
some
nice
bitter
and
roasted
notes
to
the
sweetness
in
the
finish
pretty
solid
beer
overall
d
very
easy
going
and
extremely
sessionable
at
5
5
abv
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
note
from
28
tried
another
bottle
either
i
got
another
bad
one
or
this
beer
just
isnt
too
good
real
disappointing
feels
rich
due
to
good
carbonation
drinks
easily
very
approachable
coffee
beer
i
didnt
take
down
any
notes
while
having
this
one
so
i
will
be
going
off
memory
which
i
realize
is
slightly
unfair
however
i
wouldnt
have
a
lot
to
say
about
this
even
if
i
did
have
notes
there
wasnt
anything
wrong
with
it
but
i
just
do
not
prefer
coffee
stout
it
poured
black
and
had
a
coffee
and
chocolate
smell
and
taste
i
remember
that
it
took
me
a
while
to
get
it
down
so
i
wasnt
loving
it
it
was
more
bitter
than
sweet
i
think
this
needs
to
be
consumed
with
some
sort
of
dessert
to
really
appreciate
it
fantastic
drinking
this
stout
pours
nearly
black
with
a
faint
garnet
glow
and
a
thick
sticky
tan
head
the
aroma
is
moderately
roasty
with
obvious
coffee
along
with
hints
of
chocolate
the
flavor
is
moderately
malty
deliciously
bittersweet
with
roast
coffee
flavor
the
finish
is
just
a
bit
dry
with
pleasantly
lingering
roast
coffee
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
moderate
overall
a
well
planned
well
crafted
brew
that
can
be
drunk
for
eternity
i
think
the
best
way
to
sum
up
this
beers
excellence
is
to
observe
that
a
lot
of
other
breweries
would
try
and
pour
this
into
a
bomber
and
sell
it
to
you
at
a
premium
price
new
glarus
offers
it
at
its
standard
price
point
in
their
usually
affordable
sixpacks
another
masterpiece
from
dan
and
deb
drinkability
is
quite
high
this
is
a
well
constructed
stout
in
a
more
traditional
form
than
many
ive
tried
in
recent
years
the
thinner
body
and
relative
dryness
keep
it
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
which
is
something
that
can
be
appreciated
from
time
to
time
in
a
world
of
imperial
this
and
double
thats
admittedly
i
am
not
a
fan
of
american
stouts
this
one
delivered
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
coffee
in
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
however
as
most
american
stouts
do
the
feel
fell
way
short
and
it
really
takes
so
much
away
from
the
beer
all
in
all
an
impressive
stout
not
as
coffeeforward
as
some
but
that
might
be
a
good
thing
if
this
one
were
readily
available
id
probably
be
readily
drinking
it
its
fine
i
could
have
another
one
if
i
had
more
than
one
on
a
hypothetical
second
pour
id
dump
it
in
the
glass
and
serve
it
warmer
but
even
if
this
was
in
my
market
it
probably
would
not
make
it
into
my
rotation
overall
im
not
disappointed
by
this
one
in
the
least
it
is
a
great
session
candidate
for
coffee
beer
fans
the
coffee
flavor
works
on
a
lot
of
levels
and
reveals
some
complexity
as
i
enjoyed
the
whole
bottle
however
if
you
are
looking
to
compare
this
one
to
bigger
styles
of
stout
in
terms
of
overall
flavor
youll
be
disappointed
drinkability
well
put
together
subtle
flavors
in
typical
new
glarus
style
but
with
a
quality
of
coffee
flavor
that
few
breweries
can
duplicate
and
while
most
coffee
stouts
are
quite
heavy
this
one
is
really
easydrinking
this
was
just
fine
but
didnt
really
stand
out
pours
dark
and
opaque
deep
brown
with
a
thick
tad
head
average
retention
and
thick
lacing
coffee
presence
is
much
more
subdued
than
other
coffee
stouts
but
for
a
sessionable
stout
this
is
great
with
a
strong
smooth
oatmeal
stout
like
flavor
with
a
mild
coffee
bitterness
we
dig
in
to
the
haul
from
our
woodmans
run
this
first
offering
pours
a
nearly
opaque
rubytinted
blackbrown
topped
by
about
a
finger
or
so
of
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
soft
coffee
roasted
malts
and
mild
chocolate
the
taste
is
mostly
a
showcase
of
roasted
malts
but
then
an
upsurge
of
lightish
coffee
comes
in
bringing
with
it
a
touch
of
vanilla
the
finish
though
comes
off
as
slightly
staletasting
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
coffee
stout
nothing
overtly
special
but
eminently
drinkable
wonderful
seek
this
out
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
sufficiently
dark
with
a
light
beige
head
on
the
beer
the
smell
is
a
blend
of
mostly
coffee
roast
and
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
not
really
strong
or
complex
but
still
good
the
taste
is
pretty
basic
with
there
being
coffee
and
roasted
barley
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
and
this
is
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
good
to
enjoy
its
highly
drinkable
but
just
like
many
beers
from
ng
i
think
there
is
so
much
more
that
could
be
done
even
though
the
beers
are
solid
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
it
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
but
quite
a
let
down
compared
to
the
aroma
the
aftertaste
of
this
brew
is
more
enjoyable
than
the
taste
itself
which
is
sad
i
dont
know
if
it
is
possible
to
tweak
this
recipes
flavor
without
changing
the
aroma
but
if
that
could
be
done
this
brew
would
be
spectacular
d
pretty
drinkable
but
doesnt
have
as
much
coffee
flavor
as
i
was
hoping
for
a
decent
beer
but
not
notable
there
are
a
lot
of
better
coffee
stouts
out
there
i
had
this
right
after
central
waters
coffee
stout
however
and
have
to
say
that
one
stomps
all
over
this
one
glad
to
try
this
one
and
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
drinkability
definitely
an
enjoyable
coffee
stout
full
of
flavor
but
lower
in
terms
of
abv
to
some
of
the
other
coffee
stouts
ive
been
drinking
i
would
get
this
again
very
good
coffee
stout
at
the
good
price
tag
well
worth
picking
up
a
6pack
wellmade
but
not
a
standout
by
any
means
graded
next
to
the
better
coffee
stouts
out
there
this
is
somewhat
bland
and
mediocre
but
as
a
sub
6
american
stout
its
pretty
solid
definitely
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
faint
hints
of
red
thin
but
solid
dark
tan
head
very
deep
fresh
coffee
smell
you
can
tell
that
its
beer
but
it
smells
more
like
a
cup
of
fresh
strong
coffee
or
espresso
strong
dark
coffe
taste
at
first
obviously
but
some
robust
bitter
and
malty
beer
flavors
mix
with
the
coffee
you
dont
forget
you
are
drinking
beer
after
you
swallow
though
the
strong
espresso
flavor
is
what
stays
behind
a
lot
of
coffee
beers
taste
they
brewed
the
beer
first
and
then
just
mixed
it
with
coffee
this
one
seemed
to
take
the
natural
bitter
chocolate
and
coffe
flavors
of
a
stout
and
enhance
them
with
a
fresh
coffee
flavor
very
smooth
and
fresh
tasting
beer
creamy
mouthfeel
and
smooth
drinkability
for
a
big
thick
beer
very
nicely
flavored
beer
overall
d
drinkability
is
high
given
the
short
finish
i
mentioned
myself
going
back
to
the
glass
shortly
after
taking
a
sip
i
feel
this
would
be
a
great
introduction
to
more
coffeeforward
stouts
as
this
beer
really
blends
well
with
the
hops
and
although
the
coffee
is
the
main
attraction
it
doesnt
overwhelm
and
assault
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
coffee
stout
that
i
think
can
stand
with
the
best
of
them
d
very
drinkable
i
would
enjoy
this
on
a
cold
winter
christmas
morning
if
readily
available
d
this
is
a
fantastic
coffee
stout
here
as
previously
mentioned
many
coffee
stouts
are
pretty
onedimensional
in
their
palate
new
glarus
provides
a
rich
flavorful
coffee
stout
well
done
easy
easy
drinking
the
first
stout
that
ive
really
loved
pretty
much
the
new
glarus
trademark
taste
profile
very
flavorful
but
not
overbearing
cheers
all
in
all
a
very
good
brew
worth
a
purchase
or
three
on
an
annual
basis
its
not
the
very
best
coffee
stout
out
there
but
for
the
price
its
hard
to
top
d
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
in
its
style
great
balance
and
awesome
mouthfeel
this
is
comparable
to
founders
breakfast
stout
but
with
almost
half
the
abv
quite
an
achievement
try
it
pours
black
with
a
nice
mocha
head
the
nose
really
brings
forward
a
strong
amount
of
coffee
along
with
some
slight
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
coffee
roasted
malt
hints
of
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
really
great
and
smooth
body
drinks
quite
well
overall
and
is
one
of
the
better
coffee
beers
ive
had
in
awhile
pours
a
deep
brown
black
color
with
a
medium
tall
tan
brown
head
and
some
residual
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malts
coffee
and
some
dark
chocolate
tastes
of
roasted
malts
for
bitterness
some
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
coffee
for
bitterness
and
some
caramel
for
some
ending
sweetness
body
is
light
to
medium
with
a
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
very
solid
beer
certainly
sessionable
although
the
java
flavors
are
not
quite
intense
enough
to
simply
be
called
coffee
stout
theres
quite
a
bit
of
ash
and
even
a
little
chalk
coffee
is
unquestionably
present
but
not
overthetop

54conclusion
one
of
the
better
coffee
stouts
ive
had
this
is
a
nice
stout
a
12oz
bottle
is
an
appropriate
serving
size
for
this
beer
and
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
it
i
could
definitely
have
this
one
around
more
often

flavors

some
sweet
roasty

with
not
even
the

and

a
lot
of
flavor
with
an
exceptional
dry
finish
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
well
done
pretty
expensive
beer
wouldnt
buy
again
i
was
sold
on
the
idea
that
this
is
the
first
chocolate
stout
i
was
also
sold
on
the
idea
that
ancient
aztec
culture
montezuma
and
his
chocolate
obsession
is
upon
the
label
associated
with
this
beer
i
expected
richly
intense
flavors
of
cocoa
and
that
claim
of
peruvian
coco
by
the
label
i
was
led
astray
this
is
an
acceptable
stout
not
exceptional
moreover
it
is
really
only
a
mild
stout
not
what
now
would
be
considered
chocolate
according
to
new
craft
beer
standards
i
think
what
bothers
me
most
is
the
diluted
almost
watery
mouth
feel
roasted
malts
mostly
dominate
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
beer
meaning
the
overpowering
roastyness
works
against
its
purpose
as
being
chocolatey
i
can
see
how
in
89
this
stout
may
have
seemed
game
changing
but
today
the
stout
and
its
recipe
are
due
for
some
improvement
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
until
the
flavor
and
smell
can
rightly
be
boasted
of
in
the
context
of
peru
ancient
aztecs
and
montezuma
serving
up
chocolate
in
goblets
of
beaten
gold
o
nothing
here
is
terribly
surprising
for
a
stout
ash
and
soy
are
not
my
favorite
notes
but
there
is
a
chocolate
component
and
a
strong
roasted
grain
and
these
are
always
welcome
the
main
challenge
is
that
it
is
not
terribly
cohesive
and
ultimately
the
balance
is
not
what
id
hope
not
a
bad
coffee
chocolate
stout
but
it
could
use
a
much
smoother
mouthfeel
and
some
refinement
in
the
traditional
stout
profile
pours
a
brown
color
with
tan
head
charred
cocoa
charred
malt
on
the
nose
follows
onto
the
palate
very
bitter
and
offputting
another
dam
good
stout
to
drink
overall
i
think
there
has
likely
been
some
improvement
with
the
recipe
on
this
since
others
reviewed
this
one
not
great
but
inoffensive
while
there
is
a
good
chocolate
flavor
here
its
really
lost
in
the
thin
watery
feel
and
taste
to
make
this
beer
not
really
worth
the
effort
not
much
head
and
very
little
aroma
this
beer
has
more
of
a
coffee
bitterness
than
the
chocolate
that
i
was
expecting
if
there
was
chocolate
here
it
seems
to
have
been
washed
away
by
the
somewhat
watery
taste
ok
beer
a
little
disappointed
i
had
higher
expectations
from
a
microbrew
although
ive
never
had
a
beer
from
bison
brewery
i
cannot
imagine
a
microbrew
wanting
to
put
their
name
on
a
beer
like
this
o
weak
thin
and
sour
is
all
i
can
say
overall
i
really
dont
recommend
this
beer
as
aquality
crafted
example
of
the
style
at
all
i
would
drink
it
if
offered
again
as
its
not
offensive
in
any
way
but
just
is
really
lacking
in
many
areas
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
mahogany
highlighted
blackish
coloring
with
a
light
frothy
low
profile
creamy
tan
colored
head
nose
of
roast
cocoa
nib
bakers
chocolate
and
some
subtle
cream
notes
flavors
are
roast
forward
with
a
blend
of
cocoa
and
bakers
chocolate
forward
with
a
bitter
undertone
and
creamy
highlights
that
help
to
keep
the
palate
balanced
roast
and
bitter
aftertaste
the
body
is
thin
and
light
with
a
dry
finish
that
has
a
lingering
bitterness
from
the
chocolate
notes
this
is
alright
but
the
characteristics
are
a
little
muted
throughout
for
my
tastes
o
not
a
fan
really
craved
a
stout
so
i
picked
this
up
because
it
was
4
bucks
regret
it
closest
thing
i
have
had
to
a
drain
pour
immediately
went
out
and
bought
ten
fidy
in
its
place
avoid
overall
this
beer
gets
better
as
it
warms
and
both
its
flavor
and
nose
fully
develops
a
beer
of
the
month
selection
that
i
would
not
mind
keeping
in
the
refrigerator
overall
ive
had
a
lot
of
stouts
and
this
easily
was
one
of
the
least
flavorful
ive
ever
had
no
chocolate
no
coffee
no
real
malt
substance
at
all
this
is
the
first
time
im
having
it
if
i
have
it
again
and
experience
the
same
thing
i
will
avoid
it
in
the
future
eric
overall
its
very
stoutlike
and
reminds
me
a
lot
of
guinness
depending
on
whether
or
not
you
like
guinness
thats
either
good
or
bad
overall
this
beer
is
gross
the
flavor
would
have
to
become
a
lot
smoother
to
even
approach
mediocrity
i
would
probably
rather
have
some
bmc
i
cannot
recommend
this
beer
at
all
how
does
he
brew
with
those
hooves
of
his
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
dark
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
cocoa
powder
mild
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
chocolate
a
tad
milder
and
coming
across
as
dark
chocolate
powder
theres
a
light
acridity
in
there
not
unlike
when
you
bite
into
the
darkest
of
chocolates
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smoothish
feel
overall
a
solid
stout
that
delivers
what
it
promises
without
tasting
artificial
not
bad
o
not
quite
a
drain
pour
but
way
less
than
i
was
hoping
for
ive
had
some
excellent
organic
beers
this
isnt
one
of
them
o
this
is
an
underwhelming
watereddown
disappointment
avoid
low
c
for
a
little
over
4
a
bomber
this
is
definitely
a
good
budget
option
for
a
stout
this
kind
i
wish
id
have
someone
to
split
this
with
as
its
a
bit
too
rich
yet
thinned
to
make
this
an
easy
drinking
experience
its
luckily
not
too
sweet
but
its
not
creamy
enough
to
hold
my
interest
in
the
long
run
ill
definitely
be
drinking
this
for
the
next
day
however
when
it
comes
to
introducing
people
to
more
complex
beers
this
should
do
no
harm
not
my
favorite
but
at
least
theres
that
the
first
thing
you
notice
with
this
one
is
the
pitch
black
pour
with
a
great
head
from
there
is
it
all
down
hill
for
me
the
chocolate
was
faint
it
got
a
bit
stronger
as
it
warmed
but
not
enough
when
i
read
chocolate
on
the
bottle
that
is
what
i
want
to
smell
and
taste
this
one
had
a
very
unpleasant
aftertaste
with
really
turned
me
off
plus
there
was
not
a
whole
lot
to
chew
on
for
a
stout
i
felt
it
was
quite
thin
i
was
really
disappointed
with
this
beer
it
took
a
lot
for
me
to
finish
it
to
keep
it
from
being
a
drain
pour
overall
its
disappointing
super
watery
for
a
stout
very
mild
chocolate
notes
in
the
flavor
the
smell
makes
you
think
thered
be
more
chocolate
and
roasty
flavors
the
price
point
is
great
at
4
but
id
gladly
spend
more
for
a
better
beer
next
time
good
middle
of
the
road
chocolate
stout
a
solid
stout
o
looks
great
but
the
mouthfeel
is
totally
wrong
overall
stout
hardly
chocolate
barely
this
is
a
poor
beer
even
weaker
as
a
stout
and
a
shame
to
be
called
a
chocolate
stout
ive
had
this
beer
a
few
times
in
the
past
this
will
be
my
final
time
overall
this
is
a
basic
but
tasty
and
overall
quite
satisfying
and
drinkable
stout
id
definitely
have
this
again
overall
im
not
impressed
at
all
very
bland
and
watery
if
yhe
flavours
were
stronger
this
would
be
so
much
better
im
regretting
buying
6
of
these
had
this
bottle
sitting
around
for
quite
some
time
so
time
to
give
it
a
try
the
color
is
pretty
much
solid
black
the
light
brown
head
is
near
two
fingers
high
and
leaves
generous
lacing
the
nose
includes
a
very
nice
deep
nutty
malt
with
milk
chocolate
sweetness
i
get
some
sweet
herbal
hop
and
light
charcoalcoffee
very
nice
by
my
senses
the
first
taste
brings
a
fairly
tart
citrusgrass
bite
quickly
followed
by
decided
charcoal
and
subtle
chocolate
this
is
medium
bodied
with
a
pretty
aqueous
feel
with
a
chalky
edge
it
has
modest
but
adequate
carbonation
the
flavor
leans
a
little
too
close
to
ash
tray
at
times
but
generally
is
fine
and
provides
a
somewhat
bitter
malt
brew
with
a
chocolate
kiss
not
overly
sweet
reasonably
drinkable
if
you
enjoy
the
style
definitely
worth
trying
o
decent
stout
slightly
astringent
buy
overall
very
good
overall
this
is
enjoyable
just
enjoyable
i
felt
a
little
something
was
missing
and
i
think
that
something
is
complexity
for
a
stout
its
a
little
light
and
bland
but
this
also
bumps
up
the
drinkability
points
i
can
see
myself
pulling
one
or
two
of
these
out
of
the
fridge
when
im
wanting
a
decent
stout
but
dont
want
to
feel
weighed
down
id
go
for
something
else
if
i
really
wanted
to
treat
myself
though
this
beer
was
quite
disappointing
although
it
is
very
drinkable
the
flavor
profile
is
almost
nonexistent
when
i
read
the
words
chocolate
stout
i
expect
deep
rich
and
hopefully
bold
flavors
this
brew
has
none
of
that
the
chocolatecoffeeish
aroma
is
actually
stronger
than
the
flavor
profile
which
is
annoying
because
i
keep
smelling
what
i
wish
i
were
tasting
overall
a
pretty
generic
tasting
stout
nothing
exceptional
about
it
shouldnt
even
be
called
chocolate
stout
because
its
just
kind
of
a
side
note
like
the
coffee
or
hops
overall
this
is
a
very
average
chocolate
stout
nothing
about
it
is
bad
or
offputting
its
just
completely
innocuous
a
pretty
tasty
stout
that
seems
to
always
be
in
stock
at
the
local
whole
foods
making
it
a
good
option
for
when
im
in
the
stout
mood
o
this
is
a
delicious
treat
of
a
beer
it
almost
qualifies
as
a
dessert
to
me
with
its
rich
chocolatey
tones
and
hints
of
caramel
and
even
burnt
marshmallow
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
1
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
some
slight
coffee
aromas
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
roasted
coffee
beans
and
some
cocoa
nibs
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
and
a
slightly
acidic
quality
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
with
some
nice
roasty
and
cocoa
aromas
and
flavors
initially
chocolate
aroma
the
taste
is
a
mediocre
stout
with
some
chocolate
that
gets
drier
and
bitter
not
from
hops
not
very
drinkable
though
quaffable
black
with
some
white
head
average
mouthfeel
and
average
beer
not
sweet
is
the
best
part
but
also
not
that
well
balanced
chocolate
sells
poured
into
a
wine
glass
color
was
a
nice
dark
brown
that
was
pretty
much
completely
opaque
very
thin
head
that
left
lacings
aroma
was
definitely
of
cocoa
slightly
sweet
with
a
bit
of
dark
cocoa
hints
flavor
alternated
between
espresso
and
cocoa
nicely
well
balanced
coated
the
mouth
well
but
was
a
bit
over
carbonated
overall
a
very
solid
beer
for
the
price
and
being
organic
never
hurts
overall
a
great
choice
for
a
chocolate
stout
the
only
con
i
found
is
the
mouthfeel
everything
else
is
excellent
would
definitely
buy
it
again
and
recommend
it
overall
nothing
mind
blowing
here
i
think
that
this
beers
niche
would
be
an
excellant
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
a
stout
as
a
new
beer
style
they
have
not
tried
yet
but
here
the
bottom
line
4
for
a
bomber
awesome
price
point
for
a
soild
craft
beer
offering
i
would
buy
this
on
a
regular
basis
if
i
had
it
readily
available
to
me
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
not
terribly
interesting
or
thoughtprovoking
but
still
goodtasting
o
despite
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
that
was
different
from
what
i
expected
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
out
of
the
bottle
o
not
a
bad
just
a
bit
above
an
average
stout
the
body
needs
some
work
but
other
aspects
are
solid
carbonation
on
this
is
heavy
it
bites
the
tongue
but
keeps
the
beer
flowing
it
would
likely
be
sludgy
without
the
help
pours
almost
black
with
mahogany
brown
edges
when
held
toward
the
light
thin
tan
head
forms
leaves
speckled
lacing
left
behind
fair
retention
aromatics
full
of
roasted
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
from
the
dark
roasted
malt
profile
utilized
here
this
is
weird
but
also
a
hint
of
watermelon
light
herbal
hop
profile
texture
is
light
watery
and
slippery
again
like
watermelon
juice
very
low
carbonation
finish
is
like
a
milk
stout
with
some
sourness
no
unpleasant
detractors
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
stout
not
a
bad
beer
not
that
good
either
though
but
still
worth
a
try
without
the
metal
it
would
be
pretty
good
light
to
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
especially
at
only
5
abv
the
body
is
light
and
easily
flows
over
the
tongue
but
still
offers
a
big
flavor
impact
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
unnecessarily
fizzy
but
does
not
seem
to
detract
from
the
flavors
or
experience
much
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
quite
average
overall
taste
could
be
more
assertive
here
but
overall
a
light
crisp
refreshing
chocolate
stout
overall
the
sour
flavor
is
putoff
but
there
are
some
redeeming
elements
i
e
the
roastiness
and
cocoa
ogoes
down
easy
tasty
as
hell
not
filling
decent
representation
of
style
i
highly
enjoyed
this
beer
id
passed
it
over
numerous
times
before
that
wont
happen
again
overall
tasty
drinkable
and
cheap
just
needs
bottle
dating
overall
a
decent
beer
but
i
dont
get
as
much
chocolate
as
id
expect
from
a
chocolate
stout
id
certainly
drink
this
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
if
there
were
a
good
selection
of
alternatives
o
overall
a
decent
stout
but
not
as
good
as
i
remember
its
fairly
bland
as
it
warms
and
it
turns
into
a
dry
chalky
beer
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
many
times
over
the
years
but
never
had
the
chance
to
properly
review
it
pours
a
black
body
into
my
snifter
with
a
bit
of
brown
head
with
decent
retention
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
and
marker
ink
notes
that
occasionally
strike
me
as
similar
to
the
casings
of
belgian
pralines
the
creaminess
of
the
body
is
rich
and
thick
asking
you
to
take
your
time
to
swish
and
enjoy
your
sip
for
a
while
the
milkiness
runs
deep
i
like
that
drinks
beautifully
this
is
a
beer
that
everyone
who
likes
chocolate
to
be
taken
literally
should
try
solid
brew
here
overall
drinkability
not
the
worlds
best
stout
here
weak
in
the
appearance
and
aroma
department
and
the
stout
flavor
is
not
outstanding
either
its
above
average
but
for
something
with
a
chocolate
emphasis
in
the
name
its
quite
muted
in
the
chocolate
flavors
unless
you
drink
it
fast
or
in
large
gulps
in
which
case
the
flavor
becomes
more
pronounced
so
okay
beer
but
one
is
enough
pours
a
dark
brown
color
off
white
head
aroma
is
very
light
some
roasted
malts
and
bread
pretty
much
it
in
the
taste
watery
with
some
faint
roasted
notes
spent
hop
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
flavor
as
it
warms
alittle
roasted
small
chocolate
notes
but
mainly
carbonated
water
it
may
be
organic
but
it
could
stand
to
have
some
more
lively
flavors
and
a
fuller
body
o
the
look
and
the
nose
were
promising
but
the
beer
was
a
bit
wanting
just
roused
a
pretty
nice
looking
mocha
head
that
screams
chocolate
from
the
pitch
black
tint
and
bubbles
busting
the
nose
is
all
chocolate
malt
no
smokiness
i
dig
mouth
is
definitely
hit
with
the
malty
chocolateyness
and
some
nuttyness
and
caramelly
notes
to
well
balance
this
beast
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
milky
even
enjoythis
overall
not
the
best
stout
but
by
far
not
the
worst
one
out
there
id
have
it
again
over
many
others
would
love
to
see
an
oatmeal
stout
mixed
with
this
that
said
go
grab
one
and
see
for
yourself
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
this
is
a
beer
that
contends
with
some
of
the
second
tier
stouts
o
glad
i
finally
tried
this
beer
but
it
isnt
something
i
will
revisit
taste
just
didnt
have
many
solid
beerstout
qualities
i
dont
know
if
it
is
lack
of
brewers
skillsknowledge
or
the
strict
adherence
to
keeping
the
beer
organic
that
brought
it
down
either
way
it
just
doesnt
cut
it
for
a
beer
drinker
o
not
a
terrible
beer
the
roasted
malt
flavors
are
nice
but
i
would
have
liked
to
see
some
more
powerful
chocolate
on
this
one
pours
a
jet
kola
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
fast
vanishing
one
finger
head
and
a
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
is
cocoadark
chocolate
and
dark
fruity
hopsthe
mouthfeel
is
abit
lacklustre
and
only
light
bodied
and
has
tastes
of
dutch
cocoadark
bitter
chocolatetruffles
and
finished
with
a
dark
fruity
hoppiness
and
overall
its
alright
and
another
drinkable
brew
thats
just
not
that
memorable
cheers
overall
i
guess
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
but
i
think
that
i
wont
give
anything
else
a
try
despite
the
simplicity
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
lot
i
cant
think
of
the
last
beer
i
had
where
nothing
about
it
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
this
unassuming
stout
manged
to
pull
it
off
i
remember
enjoying
this
beer
much
more
from
the
tap
at
the
scottsdale
culinary
festival
from
the
bottle
its
just
another
stout
poured
a
nice
dark
almost
black
with
a
good
looking
head
which
went
away
quickly
no
lacing
at
all
smell
is
a
bit
metallic
i
get
a
lot
of
black
olive
in
the
nose
and
no
chocolate
taste
is
where
the
biggest
letdown
comes
metallic
up
front
i
get
some
burnt
maltiness
and
bitterness
chocolate
is
not
very
pronounced
the
mouthfeel
is
so
thin
its
weird
feels
almost
as
thin
as
a
light
beer
no
body
very
little
stout
flavor
i
wont
buy
this
again
overall
you
get
what
you
paid
for
an
organic
beer
with
artificial
chocolate
flavors
mostly
cocoa
and
syrup
why
the
hate
pretty
tasty
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
thin
this
is
a
stout
right
drinks
more
like
a
notsointeresting
brown
ale
o
not
too
bad
but
not
overly
impressed
with
it
either
it
is
rather
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
weak
attempt
at
the
style
this
was
one
of
the
first
real
beers
i
ever
had
i
wasnt
impressed
then
today
i
am
fully
impressed
at
how
theyve
managed
to
craft
an
amazingly
flavorful
brew
with
such
a
low
abv
i
often
am
not
impressed
with
non
imperial
stouts
i
generally
feel
theyre
rather
boring
and
lack
luster
i
dont
see
the
point
in
a
stout
that
isnt
a
sipper
to
warm
me
in
the
winter
i
mean
stouts
still
dont
make
summer
drinking
that
said
call
me
impressed
id
certainly
buy
this
again
i
was
a
little
disappointed
had
hoped
for
more
of
a
youngs
double
chocolate
flavor
color
was
black
aroma
was
roasted
barley
not
any
chocolate
flavor
was
very
stoutlike
too
much
bitterness
for
a
chocolate
stout
and
not
a
whole
lot
of
chocolate
flavor
carbonation
was
good
m
exceptionally
smooth
and
creamy
very
good
carbonation
level
but
id
like
a
little
more
body
beer
is
a
bit
watery
in
the
finish
o
i
couldnt
finish
this
one
whether
it
was
old
or
infected
doesnt
matter
it
was
plain
gross
drain
pour
sorry
bison
i
love
the
organic
approach
but
i
wont
be
having
this
again
good
beer
overall
not
a
bad
stout
the
price
is
great
and
you
could
probably
afford
to
drink
this
stuff
all
night
long
but
i
would
suggest
you
try
this
one
and
spend
the
rest
of
your
money
on
a
better
stout
pour
is
nearly
black
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
not
too
much
lacing
just
a
few
spots
here
and
there
there
is
a
very
thin
cap
with
a
slight
collar
to
go
along
with
it
the
nose
bursts
with
quite
a
bit
of
chocolate
mostly
of
a
dark
and
dry
variety
there
is
also
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
in
the
background
the
flavor
disappoints
after
this
with
the
dryness
of
the
dark
chocolate
coming
through
but
not
all
that
much
of
the
actual
chocolate
flavor
some
modest
roast
character
in
the
background
feel
is
medium
in
body
and
dry
in
finish
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
not
something
i
kept
coming
back
for
i
had
this
out
of
a
bottle
poured
with
a
decent
tan
head
but
disappeared
completely
after
a
little
bit
at
first
it
had
an
ok
taste
but
an
off
after
taste
the
more
of
it
i
drank
the
worse
this
taste
got
i
didnt
even
finish
it
it
was
also
a
pretty
watery
stout
poured
black
with
a
large
light
brown
creamy
head
tha
lasted
throughout
and
had
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
burnt
chocolate
malts
and
a
sweet
yeast
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
it
tasted
light
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
at
first
and
then
had
a
slighltly
bittersweet
chocolatecoffee
flavor
at
the
end
with
the
flavor
lasting
a
nice
long
time
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
in
body
and
very
creamy
in
texture
with
a
flat
carbonation
overall
a
nice
mild
flavorful
stout
d
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
missing
complexity
body
and
flavor
the
appearance
and
aroma
are
great
after
that
its
a
bit
of
a
letdown
d
nothing
bold
or
outstanding
and
a
little
thin
this
beer
is
way
too
thin
too
watery
also
the
cocoa
is
barley
there
it
more
just
tasted
like
a
regular
watered
down
stout
this
beer
has
potential
especially
if
they
give
it
a
little
more
mouthfeel
and
a
little
more
cocoa
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
i
really
did
but
its
just
misses
for
a
stout
d
quite
high
an
easy
drinker
with
no
overpronounced
flavors
or
excessive
alcohol
taste
admittedly
with
a
low
abv
a
good
introductory
level
stout
might
appeal
to
those
who
like
guinness
a
lot
this
is
a
decent
beer
considering
but
theres
too
much
tartness
that
prevails
all
the
way
through
and
its
a
bit
light
in
stout
character
id
still
try
it
again
i
know
they
went
organic
with
this
one
but
just
bland
offering
that
needs
a
lot
of
work
the
clerk
at
the
store
recommended
it
and
i
was
actually
skeptical
as
he
was
pointing
out
the
organic
qualities
i
am
nto
sure
if
it
makes
any
difference
but
this
was
a
tasty
not
bitter
stout
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
stout
and
appreciate
the
brewers
ability
and
desire
to
make
this
organically
i
would
happily
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
will
not
be
buying
any
more
soon
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
little
stout
not
the
best
but
worth
a
try
i
think
i
could
go
for
this
on
occasion
without
any
fuss
i
might
pick
it
up
again
if
i
see
it
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
and
trying
some
of
their
other
brews
too
i
do
really
appreciate
the
smell
of
this
brew
though
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
not
a
significant
amount
of
chocolate
but
definitely
a
coffee
flavor
ive
seen
oily
mentioned
here
and
i
tend
to
agree
body
is
full
and
thick
its
a
good
one
off
drink
and
it
needs
to
be
paired
with
a
food
that
can
stand
up
to
it
drink
was
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
a
nice
beer
for
the
2nd
time
around
with
bison
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
solid
not
too
thin
and
not
too
thick
it
keeps
you
wanting
more
and
doesnt
leave
your
palate
saturated
like
many
bigger
imperial
stouts
would
d
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
balance
and
thats
not
really
to
my
taste
but
its
certainly
not
a
bad
brew
dwhile
the
beer
exhibits
no
flaws
other
than
the
chocolateroasted
flavor
it
is
not
too
interesting
it
is
certainly
drinkable
for
a
session
beer
lotta
cola
goin
on
here
the
chocolate
is
nice
but
isnt
enough
to
save
an
average
stout
drinkability
wouldnt
seek
out
again
d
i
dont
think
ill
ever
have
this
again
its
not
awful
by
any
means
but
its
not
that
memorable
a
light
and
drinkable
stout
but
the
taste
doesnt
deliver
much
complexity
or
even
the
chocolate
character
promised
by
the
aroma
rich
aroma
has
a
firm
tone
of
quality
roast
coffee
and
a
sweet
chocolate
overtone
it
pours
a
deep
bubbly
sable
with
a
thick
fluffy
light
tan
head
flavor
is
smoky
and
chocolaty
with
an
undertone
of
molasses
slightly
sweet
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
still
pleasing
texture
is
smooth
and
fizzy
a
bit
watery
but
not
too
shabby
d
easily
drinkable
due
to
its
mildness
however
its
mildness
is
also
its
problem
as
there
a
better
flavored
choices
out
there
easy
to
drink
taste
good
and
goes
down
smooth
with
no
funky
lingering
after
tastes
tastesubtle
milk
chocolate
coffee
notes
a
bit
thinbodied
seemed
more
of
a
porter
than
a
stout
not
too
bad
overall
but
i
was
left
wanting
a
bit
more
in
the
flavor
department
drinkability
a
little
above
average
for
a
stout
would
have
to
say
that
i
might
give
it
a
better
rating
if
i
had
some
good
food
to
go
with
it
nice
stout
i
was
expecting
more
chocolaty
taste
but
overall
its
a
good
one
overall
this
beer
is
hurt
by
being
a
style
that
has
some
amazing
beers
in
competition
with
it
compared
to
the
average
beer
i
taste
this
beer
would
rank
well
compared
to
the
average
chocolate
stout
its
only
average
and
compared
to
rogues
interpretation
of
the
style
there
is
no
comparison
this
is
a
drinkable
stout
and
i
like
that
it
is
all
organic
just
wish
it
had
more
there
there
if
i
had
to
describe
this
beer
itd
probably
be
chocolate
stout
light
it
seems
a
bit
sweeter
than
others
and
less
bold
in
its
flavors
thatll
disappoint
some
but
i
find
it
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
this
is
also
my
first
organic
beer
so
theres
that
my
first
impression
of
this
was
uh
oh
because
the
appearance
really
is
not
good
and
looks
watered
down
but
after
trying
it
this
beer
has
a
great
flavor
and
is
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
well
balanced
stout
and
a
good
after
dinner
or
session
beer
d
very
disappointing
again
the
curse
of
organicmetallic
flavor
too
thin
and
harsh
d
i
would
generally
opt
for
something
else
but
it
isnt
the
worst
brew
out
it
goes
down
with
little
resistance
its
good
but
not
to
my
liking
overall
a
decent
chocolate
stout
that
is
balanced
quite
well
worth
trying
at
the
price
its
a
good
chocolate
stout
i
would
probably
get
it
again
but
only
a
bottle
or
two
at
a
time
nothing
more
this
one
also
says
that
its
only
5
alcohol
not
6
1
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
small
tan
head
smell
is
a
light
presence
of
cocoa
powder
taste
is
a
hint
of
tobacco
up
front
dark
chocolate
in
the
middle
and
a
tart
slightly
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
average
nice
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
could
drink
2
of
these
in
a
row
a
good
stout
to
try
drinkability
not
a
particularly
heavy
stout
so
that
certainly
aids
in
the
overall
drinkability
its
no
southern
tier
choklat
or
rogue
chocolate
stout
heck
its
not
even
a
clipper
city
siren
noire
still
though
it
gets
the
job
done
for
being
a
chocolaty
stout
overall
as
i
kept
drinking
it
i
began
to
enjoy
it
more
the
malts
really
are
pretty
good
and
balanced
they
just
wash
out
way
too
quickly
it
feels
like
water
an
ok
beer
d
not
terrible
but
feels
raw
and
unfinished
this
really
is
missing
body
sweetness
and
depth
it
tastes
watered
down
and
not
particularly
inspiring
gets
very
tiresome
after
a
while
and
whatever
pleasant
notes
were
promised
on
the
nose
are
really
not
delivered
there
is
not
much
of
aftertaste
after
its
down
and
the
little
roast
malt
and
hop
flavor
combined
with
the
low
carbonation
makes
the
mouthfeel
lacking
and
needs
to
be
improved
upon
but
for
a
relatively
low
price
id
might
buy
it
again
drinks
pretty
easy
a
nice
take
on
the
style
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
and
at
5
abv
according
to
the
bottle
this
stout
is
really
easy
drinking
this
was
a
good
one
to
try
once
but
im
not
too
impressed
not
really
what
i
look
for
in
a
stout
pretty
underwhelming
all
in
all
pours
opaque
black
with
generous
head
nose
is
incredible
on
this
beer
with
plenty
of
coffee
chocolate
aromas
on
the
palate
its
a
bit
thin
and
watery
for
a
stout
but
still
has
rewarding
flavors
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
a
healthy
balance
of
hops
roasty
on
the
finish
and
very
easy
drinking
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
thick
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
the
nose
on
this
beer
just
doesnt
match
the
taste
the
nose
is
a
rich
vibrant
fudge
like
and
the
taste
is
like
bland
cocoa
it
is
a
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
nothing
phenomenal
but
at
less
than
4
a
bomber
its
a
pretty
good
deal
a
nice
little
stout
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
im
certainly
enjoying
it
the
fact
that
its
organic
is
another
plus
the
body
is
crisp
yet
smooth
decent
feel
flavor
of
cocoa
milky
sweetness
graham
cracker
crust
and
some
breadiness
bitterness
is
low
this
is
what
it
is
a
chocolate
stout
with
plenty
of
chocolatecharacter
not
bad
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
less
than
a
finger
of
tanned
head
nice
amount
of
lace
despite
a
poor
display
of
retension
nose
is
mostly
dominated
by
chocolate
powder
and
so
is
the
taste
light
feel
and
medium
amount
of
carbonation
overall
it
just
seems
a
bit
watered
down
the
organic
stamp
since
1989
shouldnt
be
an
excuse
for
lack
of
taste
as
it
warms
there
is
a
very
minor
amount
of
hop
character
in
the
nose
and
some
coffee
character
reveals
itself
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
after
letting
this
beer
warm
up
well
beyond
ideal
serving
temp
while
i
contemplated
pouring
it
down
the
drain
i
went
back
in
for
one
last
smell
an
taste
and
noted
just
a
bit
of
dark
fruitiness
overall
impression
is
that
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
it
is
somewhat
interesting
how
very
subtle
flavors
are
hidden
behind
all
the
cocoa
powder
character
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
purchase
it
again
overall
i
felt
this
was
an
excellent
brew
ive
passed
by
this
countless
times
in
the
store
but
was
given
it
as
a
gift
for
christmas
im
glad
i
did
very
well
balanced
and
worth
a
try
salud
review
from
notes
taken
on
101309
this
is
a
more
chocolate
suggestive
stout
for
sure
less
of
a
coffee
bomb
thna
some
others
and
sessionable
at
6
abv
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
would
get
it
again
if
the
price
is
right
and
i
want
a
cold
weather
sipping
stout
thats
not
too
boozy
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
or
recomending
it
to
friends
that
are
heavily
into
chocolate
stouts
not
bad
certainly
for
an
organic
beer
being
a
stout
with
a
chocolate
accent
certainly
helps
any
off
favors
that
usually
are
paired
with
organic
beers
nothing
too
exciting
but
a
good
well
rounded
beer
to
cap
off
an
evening
drinkability
this
is
a
good
drinking
brew
but
the
carbonation
hangs
in
the
stomach
more
than
others
and
causes
some
bloating
the
liquid
itself
is
not
all
that
heavy
but
with
the
carbonation
it
is
rather
filling
even
after
a
single
pint
i
can
see
drinking
this
in
the
evening
with
friends
or
family
or
drinking
one
with
a
steak
dinner
but
i
cant
imagine
anyone
slamming
these
at
a
party
i
certainly
recommend
this
brew
as
a
drinkable
and
flavorful
expression
of
what
a
stout
is
while
not
being
completely
overbearing
d
easy
drinking
stout
i
suppose
deep
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
some
decent
fine
lace
behind
roasty
java
and
spice
aroma
with
semisweet
chocolate
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
where
the
chocolate
comes
to
life
semisweet
with
a
charred
coffee
bitterness
balanced
by
rich
malts
and
mild
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
and
slightly
chalky
with
a
very
understated
carbonation
a
nice
stout
although
the
chocolate
didnt
come
through
in
this
brew
as
i
had
hoped
it
is
a
versitile
beer
i
think
this
paired
with
nicely
seared
scallops
would
pair
immensely
well
as
the
medium
body
of
the
beer
would
not
overwhelm
the
seafood
and
ther
malty
flavor
of
caramelized
sugar
would
reflectnicely
off
of
each
other
this
beer
doesnt
quite
deliver
what
was
expected
but
food
pairings
woulkd
benefit
nicely
d
not
bad
but
not
great
just
because
its
not
amazing
very
drinkable
but
not
in
a
good
way
it
is
quaffable
because
it
is
fairly
watery
hides
its
abv
well
i
guess
if
youre
looking
for
a
plus
d
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
stout
but
still
deserves
a
pat
on
the
back
nice
and
tasty
with
good
flavors
i
likeem
a
little
bit
chewier
but
if
the
flavors
match
i
cant
complain
watery
roasty
cocoa
flavor
a
bit
of
coffee
and
slight
hop
bite
lend
a
mildly
bitter
finish
plenty
drinkable
but
ultimately
a
very
forgettable
fish
swimming
in
an
ocean
of
stouts
no
need
to
describe
the
color
the
head
is
about
12
inch
thick
decent
retention
and
leaves
thin
rings
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
low
on
firepower
some
chocolate
and
chocolate
malt
you
better
inhale
deeply
or
youll
miss
it
theres
some
stoutness
to
this
but
the
body
is
a
little
thinner
than
id
expect
faint
powered
chocolate
mild
burnt
edges
a
flowery
hoppiness
in
the
back
and
a
smooth
overall
flavor
makes
this
a
solid
stout
poured
a
jet
black
with
a
nice
brown
head
nose
was
of
light
cocoa
not
a
heavy
chocolate
like
many
stouts
something
different
and
unique
to
me
the
chocolate
was
vry
subtle
and
smooth
roasted
malts
complimented
and
blended
well
with
the
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
very
roasty
and
chocolately
seemed
pretty
complex
to
me
i
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
it
my
second
favorite
behind
rogue
chocolate
stout
nothing
outstanding
but
significantly
better
than
some
of
the
other
chocolate
stout
offerings
out
there
a
touch
bitter
and
more
cocoa
than
chocolate
but
a
nice
stout
when
all
is
said
and
done
it
doesnt
hurt
to
have
a
few
bottles
of
this
one
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
just
in
case
22
ouncer
brackish
black
pour
as
it
should
dark
tan
head
heavy
roasty
malt
and
chocolatecoffee
nose
flavors
match
similarly
to
the
nose
reminds
me
more
of
a
milk
stout
maybe
a
chocolate
milk
stout
if
there
was
such
a
thing
on
the
border
of
being
quite
sessionable
would
drink
this
one
again
d
a
very
nice
chocolate
stout
the
only
think
holding
it
back
it
the
lack
of
a
little
more
creamyness
and
body
if
you
like
a
chocolate
beer
that
is
not
to
much
like
a
stout
then
this
is
you
beer
i
would
try
again

drinkability
while
the
appearance
smell
and
taste
were
pretty
decent
the
mouthfeel
really
let
me
down
to
me
thats
half
the
fun
of
a
nice
stout
and
i
was
just
let
down
by
this
i
have
5
left
and
it
wont
bother
me
to
drink
them
over
the
next
week
or
so
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
purchasing
any
more
of
it
dark
dark
brown

with
a
brown

taste
is
a
split
between
burnt
coffee
with
roasted
malt
and
watery
chocolate
not
well
balanced
finish
is
surprisingly
smooth
these
organics
are
always
lacking
in
something
this
one
being
body
good
not
great
light
to
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
bit
watery
in
the
mouth
for
this
style
very
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
really
impress
none
the
less
tasty
pours
darker
than
alfonso
soriano
i
wasnt
sure
if
it
was
beer
or
oil
has
nice
foamy

reminds
me
of
hot

like
dark
chocolate
very
clean
taste
fairly
bitter
coffee
incredibly
dark
chocolate
aftertaste
at
the
back

unfortunately
i
dont
like
dark

kind

appearance
im
pretty
bored
too
thin
for
a
good
american
stout
says
it
is
richly
textured
but
im
not
sure
i
agree
drinkability
isnt
bad
but
the
flavor
isnt
really
there
so
im
not
sure
i
would
glad
to
try
but
probably
wont
return
i
wonder
if
those
tree
sitters
in
berkeley
drink
this
beer
fascinating

silky
smooth

nice

and
easily
quaffable
a
light
interesting
take
on
the
nonexistant
chocolate
stout
style
overall
this
is
a
decent
stout
unlike
most
stouts
that
ive
had
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beverage
i
could
see
myself
going
through
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
all
in
all
i
think
that
this
stout
is
slightly
above
average
though
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
drink
by
date
etched
somewhere
on
the
bottle
although
this
beer
is
not
perfected
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
overall
an
interesting
beer
its
one
i
would
not
want
to
have
more
than
a
bottle
at
a
time
but
the
flavors
in
it
gives
it
a
little
uniqueness
however
i
think
it
falls
in
the
cracks
of
other
beers
for
not
standing
out
with
good
enough
flavors
as
i
am
now
wishing
this
was
a
mackeson
xxx
or
a
rogue
chocolate
stout
too
close
to
beers
i
like
more
and
makes
we
wish
i
had
that
one
instead
but
still
worth
a
try
i
gather
no
how
fresh
it
may
be
this
will
still
be
too
unbalanced
with
the
cocoa
to
be
comparable
to
the
many
other
options
of
chocolate
stouts
out
there
unexpected
discovery
at
my
favorite
store
picked
up
a
couple
singles
to
enjoy
aroma
is
very
malty
and
yeasty
i
like
it
the
roasted
malts

the
scent
chocolate
isnt
very
detectable
looks
good
typical
stout
a
trace
amount
of
light
shines
through
when
held
very
close
to
the
lamp
nice
dark
tan
head
that
diminishes
too
soon
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thin
but
a
nice
smooth
finish
keeps
this
category
at
par
fantastic
flavors
are
present
roasted
and
coffee
malt
are
clearly
detectable
soon
followed
by
a
perfectly
blended
chocolate
taste
cocoa
is
added
to
the
mash
when
this
is
brewed
which
is
clearly
evident
the
chocolate
tone
is
that
of
powdered
cocoa
not
overdone
at
all
nice
medium
flavored
stout
very
drinkable
and
thoroughly
enjoyable

good
the
aroma
is
roasted

and
coffee
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
although
i
think
it
tastes
a
lot
more
like
coffee
than
chocolate
but
im
not
complaining
about
that
it
is
labeled
as
a
chocolate
stout
and
the
chocolate
should
be
the
strongest
taste
in
this
beer
but
it
isnt
in
my
opinion
theres
both
sweet
and
bitter
in
this
brew
and
it
does
have
a
bitter

its

to

overall
its
a
decent
brew
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
make
it
a
point
to
seek
this
one
out
either
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
to
try
out
has
an
interesting
take
on
a
chocolate
stout
with
the
large
amount
of
cocoa
flavor
but
i
would
definitely
pass
if
offered
a
different
choice
pours
like
a
typical
stout
the
smell
is
really
weird
it
doesnt
have
too
much
of
a
roasted
smell
but
more
of
a
higher
roasted
burnt
astringent
malt
the
taste
has
a
god
amount
of
chocolate
though
it
really
went
well
with
my
rice
krispy
treats
i
was
eating
not
too
highly
roasted
in
the
taste
but
enough
to
be
stouty
overall
not
a
bad
chocolate
beer
if
it
were
a
bit
more
pleasant
smelling
then
it
would
round
out
the
experience
more
d
its
surprising
to
drink
a
chocolate
stout
that
doesnt
taste
like
dessert
im
looking
at
you
youngs
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
does
a
fantastic
job
putting
a
new
twist
on
the
style
m
d
on
the
thinner
side
in
this
case
its
a
little
more
suitable
as
it
might
become
pretty
intense
and
overwhelming
if
its
much
thicker
perhaps
some
time
id
give
it
another
shot
but
i
wont
be
in
any
rush
to
pick
up
more
the
body
is
a
downer
very
wispywater
texture
carbonation
is
low
overall
just
missing
some
depth
and
if
you
are
going
to
call
it
a
chocolate
stout
you
need
more
chocolate
in
there
not
just
choc
malt
ie
but
a
bison
in
there
d
moderately
drinkable
but
a
bit
dissapointing
overall
the
chocolate
character
is
nice
in
the
nose
but
distinctly
lacking
in
the
flavor
the
finish
is
kind
of
dull
and
lacking
in
complexity
for
a
chocolate
stout
mfd
drinkable
again
not
to
the
level
of
rogues
with
a
decent
mouthfeel
a
little
much
carbonation
for
me
in
a
stout
but
still
nice
great
little
brew
from
a
great
little
brewery
that
gets
kudos
for
being
organic
bottle
pretty
decent
little
stout
heaps
of
roasted
bitterness
and
bitter
chocolate
decent
balance
and
flavour
not
particularly
complex
but
tasty
as
with
all
west
coast
beers
theres
a
fair
few
hops
in
here
but
it
doesnt
really
unbalance
it
or
anything
a
nice
stout
drinkability
this
is
a
good
ale
and
it
is
very
sessionable
di
dont
know
if
i
would
ever
try
one
of
these
again
i
choked
the
one
down
and
i
know
i
will
never
buy
these
d
i
might
drink
this
one
again
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
appears
a
dark
almost
black
with
mahogany
brown
edges
when
held
toward
the
light
tan
head
forms
thick
and
creamy
in
texture
with
even
fine
speckled
lacing
left
behind
as
it
dwindles
aromatics
full
of
roasted
dark
chocolate
and
pseudo
coffee
notes
from
the
dark
roasted
malt
profile
utilized
here
doesnt
smell
any
more
chocolate
than
any
other
stout
but
i
guess
they
did
add
some
danish
cocoa
according
to
the
label
light
herbal
friendly
hop
profile
with
creamy
milk
chocolate
in
the
finish
flavor
brings
it
altogether
seems
light
and
airy
in
texture
but
the
flavor
rides
a
nice
wave
over
the
palate
with
mildly
brash
dark
roasts
finishing
into
a
creamy
milk
chocolate
crescendo
staying
semi
bitter
sweet
without
going
candy
on
me
some
may
ask
for
more
chocolate
sweetness
im
cool
with
the
cocoa
addition
to
the
boil
with
just
the
subtle
flow
going
on
and
definitely
more
bitterness
from
the
darker
roasts
rather
than
from
hops
which
are
evident
but
more
light
and
herbal
than
anything
else
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
texture
wise
creamy
almost
nitro
draft
feel
to
it
bitter
dry
finish
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
sweetness
carbonation
is
subtle
and
smooth
on
the
palate
finishes
with
the
dark
roasted
malt
bitterness
lingering
the
way
it
should
drinkability
is
definitely
better
than
their
ipa
this
one
brings
you
on
a
bit
of
a
journey
especially
when
living
in
the
beer
deprived
armpit
of
ohio
where
i
currently
reside
not
a
bad
stout
but
nothing
remarkable
about
it
to
me
except
being
organic
and
at
4
a
bomber
i
feel
like
i
get
more
moneys
worth
with
quite
a
few
other
stouts
in
that
price
range
d
it
is
fairly
drinkable
because
of
the
almost
imperceptible
alcohol
but
i
probably
wont
buy
another
bottle
soon
it
may
go
well
with
food
but
sampled
alone
on
its
merits
i
found
it
wanting
pours
jet
black
with
a
dark
tan
to
light
brown
head
in
the
aroma
cocoa
and
a
roasty
maltiness
in
the
taste
a
roasty
malt
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
yet
very
watery
in
the
taste
a
small
bite
yet
very
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
semi
dry
and
small
cocoa
aftertaste
good
look
and
aroma
however
watery
and
quite
thin
d
overall
a
very
good
and
for
me
very
local
beer
that
has
a
good
balance
of
flavor
with
the
only
marked
downside
being
its
the
thinness
of
body
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
on
tap
d
a
nice
cocoaforward
stout
that
is
hampered
by
a
thin
and
watery
body
and
quickly
dissipating
malt
flavors
a
decent
offering
i
wouldnt
shun
in
the
future
this
is
probably
a
one
and
done
for
me
but
not
too
bad
bison
makes
a
lot
of
good
stuff
and
im
sure
someone
who
really
liked
this
sort
of
beer
would
think
it
quite
good
mouthfeel
is
between
medium
and
light
bodied
an
easy
drinking
stout
that
borders
on
a
porter
in
body
either
way
i
thought
it
was
a
good
beer
but
not
as
robust
and
flavorful
as
i
expected
d
interesting
it
is
one
of
the
darkest
tasting
stouts
i
have
ever
had
i
might
have
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
usually
one
expects
stouts
to
be
full
in
body
i
find
this
one
to
be
a
bit
thin
carbonation
is
acceptable
though
however
the
beer
is
smooth
on
the
palate
all
in
all
this
brews
mouthfeel
is
about
average
maybe
its
just
me
but
i
think
that
it
should
have
a
tiny
bit
more
body
oh
well
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
though
there
are
much
better
american
stouts
out
there
wouldnt
buy
it
again
though
unless
this
was
the
only
stout
i
could
get
my
hands
on
really
nothing
to
write
home
about
just
another
average
stout
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
this
beer
was
very
black
with
a
very
nice
tan
head
the
beer
smelled
like
a
big
fat
hershey
bar
it
was
kinda
burnt
sorta
roasted
taste
that
i
liked
very
well
i
also
liked
that
it
was
organic
as
a
plus
very
heavy
i
will
buy
again
drinkability
excellent
goes
very
well
with
steak
and
potatoes
does
not
detract
from
the
intrinsic
glory
of
these
marvelous
foods
alone
it
is
as
easy
as
water
to
drink
no
hints
of
alcohol
that
i
noticed
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
good
representation
of
style
a
good
beer
to
relax
with
but
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
a
bomber
in
an
evening
i
found
that
the
organic
beers
need
to
be
either
really
hopped
up
or
a
heavy
stout
to
mask
whatever
causes
the
nasty
bite
that
always
seems
to
come
in
organic
beers
but
this
one
does
the
latter
very
well
purchased
bevmo
pasadena
ca
drinkability
i
dont
see
myself
trying
another
beer
to
watery
and
bitter
not
enough
umph
w
this
drink
the
chocolate
stout
is
black
as
night
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
it
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
the
flavor
that
hits
the
palate
is
deep
dark
maltiness
with
chocolate
overtones
and
good
alcoholic
nature
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
a
tad
bit
bitter
for
my
tastes
not
a
bad
organic
beer
the
carbonation
is
low
which
lets
the
aftertaste
of
the
cocoa
come
to
play
up
here
in
the
nw
i
am
seeing
more
organic
beers
hit
the
shelf
d
high
since
its
watery
but
i
wont
have
it
again
tastes
like
it
smells
very
well
balanced
only
the
malts
are
dulled
by
a
weak
body
and
a
watery
middle
dry
stout
goes
into
water
which
goes
into
a
nice
dry
hop
if
that
middle
was
chocolatey
or
even
stouty
this
would
be
one
hell
of
a
stout
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
and
enjoiyable
beer
great
taste
d
highly
drinkable
flavorful
robust
as
many
extremes
as
i
can
think
of
and
more
this
is
probably
not
recommended
for
those
who
want
a
chocolate
malt
flavor
since
it
tastes
like
real
chocolate
combined
w
a
very
smooth
stout
not
over
the
top
or
extreme
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
it
hands
out
a
gentle
punch
and
makes
you
want
to
continue
tasting
long
after
the
first
pint
is
gone
poured
with
some
head
though
not
long
lasting
and
lacing
was
minimal
very
dark
in
color
as
expected
nice
aroma
with
some
cacao
oder
the
chocolate
taste
was
very
subtle
at
finish
not
nearly
enough
too
really
be
called
a
chocolate
stout
but
the
taste
was
very
good
overall
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
nothing
irritating
on
the
tongue
a
good
drinkable
chocolate
stout
actually
gains
drinkability
based
on
the
minimal
chocolate
taste
d
i
could
probably
only
handle
one
of
these
in
any
given
period
one
is
enough
unless
youve
got
an
addiction
to
chocolate
or
a
major
sweettooth
overall
this
is
a
good
session
beer
but
not
greatly
balanced
as
far
as
trying
to
promote
this
as
a
chocolate
stout
i
cant
taste
the
cocoa
at
all
dang
the
mouthfeel
lets
me
down
instantly
before
the
taste
even
has
a
chance
to
the
texture
is
watery
and
lifeless
with
no
kick
or
energy
to
the
aftertaste
some
reasoable
coffee
malt
a
little
hop
balance
but
overall
kind
of
dull
and
one
dimensional
no
assertiveness
no
aggresiveness
just
kind
of
blah
definitely
disappointing
so
many
better
stouts
for
the
dough
silky
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
not
as
thickfull
as
expected
its
a
great
pint
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
want
to
polish
off
a
six
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
as
i
powered
through
this
one
pretty
fast
its
a
solid
stout
but
i
dont
know
about
the
chocolate
there
just
isnt
a
whole
lot
there
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
notes
chocolate
flavors
are
actually
quie
subdued
when
compared
with
the
hefty
roasted
malt
flavors
hints
of
bitter
coffee
that
leaves
a
nice
bitterness
on
the
palate
well
into
the
finish
leafy
hops
also
are
noticeable
creamy
and
smooth
across
the
palate
a
nice
brew
but
not
anything
thats
jaw
dropping
d
went
down
easy
but
didnt
really
want
another
one
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
poured
very
dark
back
with
big
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
not
a
real
heavy
mouthfeel
and
flavors
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
finish
is
nice
with
a
touch
of
citrus
hops
this
is
not
rogue
chocolate
stout
but
then
what
is
very
well
done
the
beer
was
as
dark
as
a
89
cocoa
chocolate
bar
it
had
a
massive
mocha
head
of
foam
to
it
but
i
think
it
was
too
big
the
first
time
i
poured
it
this
mocha
head
of
foam
came
out
of
nowhere
and
made
the
mug
look
like
an
erupting
volcano
of
black
beer
after
it
overflowed
the
glass
it
looked
like
the
mug
was
leaking
oil
all
over
the
place
after
it
settled
i
tried
to
pour
it
a
second
time
and
it
did
it
again
so
after
it
settled
down
for
the
second
time
i
poured
the
beer
a
third
time
and
it
didnt
do
it
again
i
finally
got
the
entire
bottle
into
the
glass
and
it
only
took
three
tries
it
had
a
rich
aroma
of
old
dark
chocolate
roasted
chocolate
malt
a
hint
of
chocolate
covered
cherries
and
a
pinch
of
chocolate
covered
hops
at
the
end
the
taste
was
a
lot
like
the
aroma
but
it
had
a
few
subtle
differences
it
tasted
like
a
bar
of
dark
chocolate
was
infused
with
chocolate
malt
chocolate
covered
hops
and
with
a
pinch
of
chocolate
covered
cherries
it
wasnt
just
one
taste
after
another
it
was
just
one
big
organic
chocolate
punch
to
the
tastebuds
it
was
medium
bodied
with
an
aftertaste
of
a
watered
down
hersheys
milk
chocolate
bar
with
a
dash
of
bitter
hops
added
into
the
mix
it
was
just
an
ok
beer
and
probably
is
the
best
organic
beer
ive
had
if
you
love
drinking
organic
alcoholic
chocolate
then
by
all
means
try
this
one
this
beer
poured
a
jet
black
with
a
large
caramel
colored
head
that
quickly
disappated
with
no
retention
appearance
a
bit
disappointing
looked
stellar
at
the
pour
but
thinned
down
to
a
watery
body
most
captivating
is
the
taste
with
a
thick
smokiness
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
and
comines
with
the
darkroasted
coffee
flavors
roasted
almonds
and
of
course
the
dark
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
again
a
bit
watery
for
a
stout
but
wellbalanced
in
carbonation
but
lacked
the
creaminess
i
was
hoping
for
if
this
was
a
bit
thicker
it
would
do
wonders
for
the
mouthfeel
appearance
and
boost
the
already
great
taste
then
it
would
be
a
slamdunk
but
for
now
its
a
slightly
above
average
stout
drinkability
not
the
best
chocolate
stout
out
there
but
certainly
not
the
worst
the
head
is
very
noisy
while
it
falls
its
a
light
tan
color
over
a
nearopaque
brown
body
the
head
is
far
too
slick
to
the
glass
id
really
like
to
see
a
lot
less
carbonation
in
this
one
the
nose
is
highly
roasted
and
also
a
bit
sweet
i
can
definitely
smell
a
bit
of
dry
cocoa
and
some
anise
the
taste
is
very
dry
but
very
noticeably
chocolatey
sour
too
due
to
high
acidity
the
mouth
is
medium
with
very
high
carbonation
this
is
not
a
beer
ill
be
buying
again
but
it
might
be
nice
with
a
high
chocolate
bar
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
yesterday
at
the
same
time
as
one
of
brooklyn
black
chocolate
stout
two
very
different
beers
i
know
but
both
having
chocolate
in
the
name
i
wanted
to
see
how
they
compared
this
one
is
somewhat
easier
to
drink
due
to
the
lower
alcohol
content
the
addition
of
actual
cocoa
added
a
unique
chocolate
bitterness
however
overall
a
good
beer
for
nightcap
on
a
cold
winter
night
dinkability
pretty
good
love
the
flavor
unique
powerful
aroma
not
too
heavy
a
nice
surprise
given
its
organic
which
is
usually
the
kiss
of
death
i
liked
it
a
quality
desert
beer
but
not
something
id
like
to
session
this
is
a
chocolate
stout
with
a
real
chocolate
finish
very
dark
and
very
packed
with
cocoa
vanilla
roasted
malt
and
even
tobacco
notes
a
big
beer
with
not
so
much
alcohol
this
is
worth
buying
for
those
cold
winter
nights
when
you
want
a
beer
and
a
piece
of
chocolate
22
oz
bottle
color
dark
black

sharp
quickly
dissipating
coffee
color
head
nose
of
milk
chocolate
vanilla
coffee
and
anise

taste
of
milk
chocolate
roasted
and
dark
berries
body
medium
and
fizzy
almost
over
carbonated

aftertaste
of
bitter
chocolate
and
sour
an
absolutely
excellent
brew
you
would
be
fool
not
to
have
one
or
more
of
these
an
awesome
example
for
the
style
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
im
gonna
go
get
some
oreos
and
finish
this
22
oz
bad
boy
drinkability
when
cold
low
when
room
temp
good
not
a
chocolate
beer
to
give
to
a
chocolate
lover
and
expect
them
to
like
it
though
served
at
cellar
temp
in
pint
glass
poured
a
deep
ebony
with
a
dark
tan
long
lasting
head
the
aroma
of
fresh
roasted
malt
and
coffee
rushed
from
my
glass
the
stout
is
a
tad
richer
on
the
front
side
malt
coffee
and
roasted
malt
dominated
through
out
the
finish
was
suprisingly
dry
for
such
a
rich
stout
a
clean
aftertaste
resulted
deep
tan
head
with
strong
retention
into
its
foamy
formy
former
self
deep
blackbrown
color
no
lacing
left
great
bitter
chocolate
nose
with
roasted
and
very
lightly
smoked
malts
by
bitter
chocolate
nose
i
mean
bakers
chocolate
straight
up
cacao
the
cacao
bitterness
blends
with
the
more
subtle
hop
to
creat
a
great
bitter
palate
blend
this
with
the
great
dark
malts
giving
off
hints
of
toffee
and
coffee
smooth
palate
but
a
little
chewy
at
the
end
great
beer
though
will
purchase
again
if
they
start
distributing
to
il
had
to
go
to
in
to
buy
drinkability
the
yeasty
flavor
turned
me
off
from
another
one
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
again
though
a
good
chocolate
stout
though
not
the
best
ever
i
bought
a
case
of
24s
for
20
and
was
very
happy
with
my
purchase
i
liked
this
one
much
better
than
their
red
or
belgian
the
chocolate
could
be
more
pronounced

d
easy
to
drink
but
there
are
so
many
better
stouts
out
there
on
tap
at
the
sierra
brewfest
in
grass
valley
ca
found
this
one
and
kept
coming
back
deep
dark
brown
with
big
bubbles
and
a
brownishwhite
head
sweet
and
rich
with
major
chocolate
notes
both
from
chocolate
malts
and
from
real
chocolate
the
sugary
sweetness
of
the
malts
lingers
forever
and
it
pulls
it
off
without
being
overly
thick
or
sticky
refreshing
even
on
this
hot
sunny
day
a
real
treat
for
stout
and
chocolate
fans
alike
also
good
to
see
an
organic
brew
that
fits
in
and
doesnt
scream
im
organic
so
thats
why
i
taste
a
little
bit
different
than
your
favorite
beer
this
is
just
a
good
old
beer
that
happens
to
be
organic
poured
a
nice
walnuttinged
black
faint
cocoa
powder
in
the
aroma
nice
substance
to
the
flavor
with
the
chocolate
note
up
front
but
reserved
front
was
shortlived
with
a
follow
up
by
roasted
malt
that
was
a
touch
rough
chocolate
perception
faded
rather
quickly
and
the
beer
held
up
nicely
but
without
depth
nice
enough
with
a
beef
dinner
drinkability
i
tend
to
prefer
the
smoother
less
burnt
style
of
stout
but
this
is
a
fine
beer
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
thin
yet
bold
i
wont
be
drinking
many
more
of
these
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
on
the
plus
side
of
medium
bodied
the
beer
has
a
sweet
begining
but
quickly
dries
out
this
is
a
pretty
solid
stout
however
i
would
drink
one
or
two
and
move
on
to
a
different
brew
mouthfeeldrinkability
pleasantly
more
dry
in
the
finish
than
i
expected
however
it
has
a
powdery
finish
to
it
almost
like
undissolved
jello
granules
in
your
jello
maybe
this
would
be
good
for
a
beginner
to
stouts
i
thought
it
needed
more
kick
with
the
first
sip
i
taste
heavy
cocoa
mixed
in
with
some
bitterness
and
stale
coffee
i
really
dont
taste
any
chocolate
at
all
but
loads
of
cocoa
and
like
most
things
organic
this
is
not
very
good
not
at
all
others
might
like
it
i
dont
i
dont
know
if
i
want
to
choke
it
down
and
hope
i
end
up
liking
it
or
pouring
it
down
the
drain
overall
a
decent
stout
not
too
chocolatelynothing
close
to
rogues
chocolate
stout
the
first
time
i
ever
had
an
organic
beer
was
in
new
york
and
they
were
some
offerings
from
wollavers
i
had
not
really
begun
to
appreciate
good
beers
quite
yet
and
this
time
i
feel
like
there
is
still
something
missing
pours
nice
and
black
but
still
feels
a
bit
thin
tastes
something
like
coffee
that
doesnt
have
much
body
burnt
aroma
the
thing
is
that
compared
to
rogues
offering
in
this
department
this
bison
beer
just
doesnt
measure
up
it
is
a
nice
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
but
i
wont
be
searchign
it
out
again
anytime
soon
poured
a
pitch
black
color
the
light
tan
head
was
sticky
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lace
around
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
hint
of
dark
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
and
leafy
hop
has
a
creamy
mediumfull
body
bitter
sweet
choclates
hit
the
tounge
first
i
can
really
taste
the
chocolate
they
add
to
the
mash
a
hint
of
coffee
bitter
hops
and
roasted
malts
has
a
dry
slighty
bitter
finish
this
beer
pairs
nicey
with
any
dark
meat
but
i
would
personally
wait
until
after
dinner
and
drink
it
for
desert
i
appreciate
their
dedication
to
organic
brewing
though
im
not
sure
ive
ever
drank
an
inorgantic
one
anyhow
the
beer
is
nice
the
color
hue
and
darkness
is
typical
for
good
stouts
the
aroma
is
firm
with
roasted
grain
cocoa
espresso
and
a
fermented
sourness
tastes
very
agressive
with
the
roasted
grains
adding
big
charcoallike
bitter
roasted
dryness
the
cocoa
helps
to
temper
the
hasrsh
burnt
flavors
and
add
a
faint
sweetness
most
sweetness
results
from
a
nice
malt
balance
the
feel
is
moderately
heavy
but
not
thick
smoothes
considerably
toward
the
finish
to
help
with
the
drinkability
but
still
finishes
with
a
chared
roasty
bittering
that
remains
a
little
overbearing
this
one
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
chocolate
seems
to
be
the
bitter
version
not
the
sweet
chocolate
the
flavor
has
some
roasted
character
along
with
a
strong
cocoabitter
chocolate
very
malty
with
little
trace
of
hops
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
but
it
could
use
a
little
more
body
to
bring
it
around
overall
a
nice
chocolate
stout
drinkability
taste
but
i
would
prefer
less
carbonation
and
a
more
straightforward
stout
experience
as
mentioned
astringent
mouthfeel
dry
finish
with
not
much
body
for
a
stout
i
was
disappointed
with
this
offering
probably
will
not
buy
this
one
again
second
time
i
have
had
this
and
i
still
like
it
thanks
to
darkover
for
the
hookup
dark
brownblack
with
a
thick
and
foamy
dark
brown
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
decent
lacing
very
appealing
look
all
around
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
body
seems
rich
at
first
then
suddenly
becomes
a
little
watery
cocoa
and
chocolatey
malt
flavors
are
pretty
strong
with
a
bit
of
coffee
thrown
in
too
the
finish
is
moderately
bitter
coffee
all
in
all
above
average
drinkability
a
little
rough
going
down
i
enjoyed
trying
this
and
this
was
the
first
organic
beer
ive
had
but
i
dont
see
myself
grabbing
for
it
again
big
coffee
and
chocolate
aroma
i
get
more
coffee
notes
than
chocolate
really
but
then
cocoa
powder
can
do
that
deep
black
with
a
slowly
diminishing
two
finger
thick
mocha
head
taste
a
little
like
count
chocula
and
beer
very
chalky
cocoa
fore
followed
by
some
roasty
malt
and
an
admirably
bitter
finish
though
it
is
a
tad
watery
but
something
just
doesnt
work
for
me
here
its
just
forced
feeling
and
while
i
like
the
individual
tastes
there
is
something
about
the
total
effect
i
dont
like

this
beer
kept
its
flavor
in
my
mouth
for
for
a
long
time
after
each
drink
it
was
a
rich
flavor
of
a
dark
chocolate
truffle
rolled
in
coco
powder
then
washed
down
with
a
shot
of
esspresso
highly
recommend
this
beer
lost
a
point
due
to
the
fact
that
there
were
some
chunks
floating
in
my
glass
after
the
pour
wow
what
a
beer
pours
a
midnight
black
color
topped
by
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
of
dark
roasted

cocoa
a
hint
of
licorice
and
a

palate
is

roasted

dark
chocolate
some
bittering

and
some
anise
and
licorice
on
the
finish
body
is
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
but
creamy
nonetheless
and
leading
to
a
nice
dry
finish
doesnt
pair
as
well
with
a
chocolate
orange
as
i
would
have
hoped
not
particularly
special
pours
an
opaque
black

a
nice

doesnt

at
all
the
aroma

a
big
coffee
character
roasted

dark

blackstrap

some

the
flavor
starts
off
with

roasted

floral
hops
and
some
dutch
cocoa
in
the
finish
as
well
as
some
mild

it

if
they
hadnt

find
the

beer

especially
in

with

a

on

this

is
right
up
there
with

of
the
better

ales
in
my
book
good
beer
but
not
great
o
great

ill
be
back
othis
is
a
tasty
stout
that
i
should
drink
more
of
the
bitterness
levels
are
just
right
for
me
it
looks
good
smells
good
and
tastes
good
if
i
had
to
knock
it
i
would
say
that
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
no
specific
scent
pulling
through
picking
up
mostly
on
burnt
coffee
bean
leaves
a
bitter
malty
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
a
few
extra
seconds

obsidian
is
the
standard
i
use
for
stouts
midnight

the
taste
is
absurdly
good

roasted

and
dark
chocolate
sweetness
predominant
anise
rumsoaked
berries
and
a
healthy
taste
of
bittering
hops
that
do
not
bite
its
a
bitter
brew
not
for
those
expecting
guinness
or
stouts
of
that
ilk
but
the
bitter
is
elegantly
balanced
by
a
complex
flavor
profile
moderate
mouthfeel
overall
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
in
this
style
and
in
beers
in
general
overall
the
first
time
i
had
this
a
few
months
ago
i
remember
thinking
it
was
thin
and
lacking
flavor
compared
to
what
i
expect
from
a
stout
after
seeing
the
ba
rating
i
figured
i
must
have
been
missing
something
or
maybe
i
got
a
bad
sample
despite
the
very
inviting
presentation
and
a
good
balance
i
still
found
it
to
be
lacking
richness
and
flavor
in
every
other
respect
it
is
an
excellent
stout
and
it
is
very
drinkable
i
will
happily
drink
more
of
these
the
deschutes
black
butte
porter
is
more
exemplary
of
its
style
in
my
opinion
taste
rich
roasty
chocolate
up
front
with
some
pronounced
charred
burnt
wood
accents
i
get
a
bittersweet
warming
finish
a
strong
sturdy
and
perfectlyexecuted
stout
that
packs
tons
of
complexity
and
flavors
into
every
sip
wonderful
and
an
ideal
example
deschutes
are
masters
of
the
darkroast
ale
and
obsidian
more
than
proves
it
just
an
excellent
american
stout
overallgood
beer
that
leaves
a
little
zip
on
the
end
of
your
tongue
overall
what
a
kickass
stout
and
for
an
insane
value
to
boot
7

a
sixer
for
me
as
you
can
see
from
my
review
i
think
this
beer
rocks
on
all
levels
and
there
just
isnt
much
more
to
say
about
it
than
that
o
as
everyone
below
has
mentioned
this
nails
the
stout
style
smooth
and
good
not
too
heavy
a
nice
stout
one
of
my
favorites
from
over
twenty
years
ago
finally
got
to
have
it
again
on
a
ski
trip
this
winter
and
it
didnt
disappoint
it
was
as
good
as
i
remembered
definitely
a
world
class
beer
the
way
a
stout
should
look
and
taste
this
is
one
great
tasting
stout
probably
the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
dark
and
what
a
beer
should
taste
like
well
balanced
nice
and
roasty
this
is
what
a
stout
should
taste
like
overall
great
coffee
creamy
stout
overall
this
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
night
if
you
are
a
stout
lover
this
a

a

stout
out
there
i
havent
had
it
had
this
on
tap
recently
too
and
id
have
to
rate
that
experience
as
very
close
to
perfection
wow
what
a
wonderful
stout
just
so
damn
tasty
and
rich
in
flavor
beautifully
dark
stout
with
a
smooth
taste
and
feel
o
i
havent
had
this
in
a
while
and
i
had
forgotten
how
much
i
liked
it
very
good
beer
to
have
on
hand
and
im
glad
i
have
easy
access
to
it
looks
pitch
black
obsidian
is
a
good
name
for
this
nice

head
smells
of
roasted
coffee
tastes
like
smokey
roasted
coffee
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
great
stout
in
a
6
pack
v
medium
o
frankly
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
the
flavors
are
bold
and
perfectly
balanced
while
the
beer
is
not
too
heavy
or
boozy
ive
still
never
had
even
a
mediocre
brew
from
deschutes
my
first
real
stout
still
a
great
beer
got
a
bottle
of
this
at
a
tiny
shop
in
honolulu
while
the
smell
and
look
were
on
point
the
taste
was
just
too
bitter
for
me
it
left
a
nasty
burned
chocolate
flavor
in
my
mouth
wasnt
a
fan
of
it
id
be
willing
to
try
it
on
tap
but
for
now
its
a
no
go
for
me
popping
a
bottle
of
obsidian
open
as
with
most
beers
i
first
notice
the
head
it
is
thick
but
its
the
color
thats
more
notable
a
kind
of
really
light
umber
tone
capping
the
impenetrably
black
body
its
smooth
and
i
noticed
a
relatively
low
amount
of
carbonation
in
my
glass
the
flavor
is
primarily
roasted
malts
with
the
usual
notes
of
coffee
and
cocoa
more
than
a
straight
chocolate
as
one
reviewer
noted
there
is
a
bit
of
a
char
to
the
flavor
especially
in
the
aftertaste
overall
i
can
see
this
as
an
easydrinking
stout
it
almost
seems
a
bit
too
thin
but
i
do
like
its
cleanliness
served
at
5560
f
in
a
tulip
great
stout
more
complex
char
to
sweetness
imo
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
a
great
value
on
a
readily
available
and
high
quality
stout
pours
pitch
black
with
dark
brown
edges
thick
and
foamy
light
brown
head
dissipates
quickly
leaves
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
sweet
roasted
malts
tastes
dark
roast
coffee
mocha
and
dark
roastedburnt
malts
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
nice
medium
body
overall
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
stouts
but
enjoyed
this
one
when
included
in
a
sampler
pack
not
something
ill
seek
out
by
itself
but
worth
trying
if
you
like
the
stout
style
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
for
sure
overall
a
solid
brew
a
friend
brought
me
a
six
pack
while
on
vacation
id
definitely
buy
another
o
a
great
baseline
for
stouts
and
another
great
beer
from
deschutes
its
not
as
special
as
the
abyss
or
black
butte
but
its
very
good
overall
these
guys
win
this
is
a
stellar
stout
its
just
so
smooth
and
tastes
like
it
should
be
thicker
smells
like
roasted
malts
and
goes
down
so
smooth
the
appearance
is
spelled
out
in
the
name
and
i
love
seeing
peoples
eyes
pop
when
they
see
it
for
the
first
time
cant
have
just
one
though
serving
type
bottle
o
excellent
beer
in
my
top
ten
of
stouts
perfectly
balanced
very
good
stout
had
it
on
nitro
very
smooth
overall
this
is
so
far
an
impressive
beer
and
one
that
offers
an
abundance
of
flavors
and
complexity
along
with
an
abv
6
4
that
would
easily
allow
having
more
than
one
it
has
definitely
earned
a
place
on
my
have
more
in
the
future
list
this
is
an
ultra
black
thick
brew
tan
head
with
a
decent
lace
grain
and
a
touch
of
smoke
and
coffee
in
the
smell
firm
bitterness
in
the
taste
some
underlying
thick
smoothness
bitter
and
powerful
excellent
brew
if
guinness
had
a
bigger
badder
stronger
better
looking
twin
brother
obsidian
would
be
it
definitely
a
great
go
to
stout
not
going
to
blow
your
socks
off
but
its
a
must
have
in
your
fridge
if
your
a
stout
drinker
like
i
am
happy
thanksgiving
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
it
tastes
great
and
is
satisfying
o
solid
bold
stout
though
i
wish
it
was
a
skoche
less
bitter
and
the
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
were
a
bit
more
dominant
still
a
very
good
brew
taste
very
strong
roasted
flavor
it
does
have
nice
coffee
flavor
as
well
lastly
there
is
a
small
hint
of
chocolate
but
it
was
not
very
strong
overall
this
this
an
easy
drinking
stout
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
does
not
leave
a
bitter
aftertaste
the
lack
of
bitterness
makes
this
an
interesting
stout
good
if
you
dont
like
a
bitter
stout
poured
an
opaque
black
with
slight
chocolate
hue
in
the
light
minimal
head
bitter
aromas
roasted
malt
bitter
coffee
some
light
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
molasses
tasted
of
coffee
roasted
malt
balanced
bitterness
tasted
bigger
than
6
medium
mouthfeel
perfect
for
a
regular
stout
i
prefer
them
a
little
meatier
overall
outstanding
update
it
is
even
better
on
nitro
all
of
the
great
flavors
etc
with
a
mouthfeel
like
chocolate
milk
amazing
o
with
all
the
big
impy
stouts
out
there
you
can
easily
forget
how
good
a
regular
good
ol
stout
can
be
this
one
is
happy
to
remind
you
overall
4
02
this
is
not
my
favorite
deschutes
offering
it
is
definitely
a
good
smokey
stout
with
heavy
char
and
dark
notes
long
after
the
swallow
the
taste
lies
lingering
on
the
palate
with
roasted
coffee
and
light
smoke
it
is
a
worthy
offering
and
should
be
tried
if
spotted
this
is
a
great
stout
very
bitter
but
stays
true
to
style
well
crafted
and
very
enjoyable
recommended
overall

i
ended
up
buying
the
deschutes
variety
pack
because
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
now
and
have
not
seen
it
anywhere
else
it
did
live
up
to
my
expectations
but
considering
my
indulgence
in
riss
its
not
quite
robust
enough
speaking
of
robust
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
smuttynose
robust
porter
still
a
great
regular
stout
and
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
mouthfeel
bitter
is
very
light
can
drink
a
few
easily
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
with
no
problem
very
similar
to
their
black
butte
which
seemed
a
tad
less
bitter
but
both
are
very
good
strong
coffee
flavor
and
hints
of
chocolate
impressive
stout
this
might
be
one
of
the
most
perfect
regular
stouts
ive
ever
head
smooth
creamy
roasted
barley
just
a
nice
beer
rating
a
deschutes
makes
a
fine
stout
and
you
should
seek
this
one
out
if
you
like
stouts
i
actually
think
their
porter
is
slightly
better
but
i
enjoy
both
this
stout
is
a
touch
on
the
bitter
side
but
not
as
much
as
some
so
i
can
still
make
it
work
another
success
from
this
brewery
o
awesome
stout
very
heavy
and
very
dark
just
like
a
stout
should
be
big
time
bitterness
though
which
threw
me
a
bit
at
first
but
once
you
get
used
to
it
it
works
well

o
a
heavenly
stout
one
im
glad
to
finally
get
my
mitts
on
a
tempting
taste
by
the
fireside
or
on
the
back
porch
at

the
beer
pours
a
foamy
brown
head
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
the
beer
itself
is
an
opaque
and
very
dark
brown
color
the
beer
smell
is
a
sweet
dark
chocolate
with
deeply
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
the
beer
taste
is
surprisingly
different
from
the
smell
the
beer
taste
has
a
much
stronger
hop
presence
with
a
weaker
mexican
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
taste
the
hop
bitterness
and
chocolate
mix
rather
well
the
beer
is
heavy
bodied
creamy
and
thick
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
and
worth
getting
i
gotta
say
i
may
have
drank
more
than
my
share
of
these
sorry
uncle
packs
a
lot
of
punch
for
a
standard
stout
smooth
and
flavorful
chocolate
and
roast
richness
with
the
convenience
of
only
being
6

o
a
very
good
imperial
stout
especially
for
a
yearround
massproduced
ale
tons
of
flavor
but
the
finish
is
a
minor
setback
glass
stout
glass
looks
like
a
compromise
between
a
tulip
and
a
snifter
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
definitely
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
gets
the
opportunity
if
youre
looking
to
venture
out
and
try
a
stout
and
youre
a
bit
afraid
to
do
so
dont
be
afraid
to
try
this
stout
if
you
dont
like
this
stout
you
wont
like
any
stouts
i
expected
this
to
be
good
and
was
surprised
by
its
quality
its
a
perfectly
crafted
stout
and
i
wish
i
could
drink
it
regularly
no
distro
nearby
cheers
smell
exceptional
notes
of
caramel
malts
and
hazelnut
tastemouthfeel
exceptional
as
well
roasted
malts
and
espresso
with
a
rich
smooth
flavor
overall
i
prefer
this
beer
chilled
as
it
warms
it
tends
to
become
more
bitter
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
far
overall
definitely
a
good
stout
i
had
somewhat
of
spicyfruity
undertone
that
wasnt
my
favorite
but
it
melds
really
well
with
the
beer
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
stout
with
an
abundance
of
flavor
it
is
very
malty
and
the
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
compliment
it
well
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
some
more
of
these
in
the
future
wonderful
stout
overall
good
stuff
though
it
pretty
much
drinks
like
an
imperial
stout
a
dense
and
straightforward
roastforwardchocolate
flavor
for
a
lowerabv
stout
done
well
always
nice
hints
of
coffee
beautiful
color
smooth
and
creamy
just
delightful
i
love
the
thickness
and
the
mouthfeel
of
this
stout
i
very
much
enjoyed
the
creaminess
and
the
full
bodied
taste
this
beer
is
highly
rated
for
a
reason
it
is
fantastic
try
it
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
overall
perfect
american
stout
so
well
balanced
i
prefer
to
drink
this
at
at
least
50
degrees
or
warmer
because
it
adds
creaminess
and
even
more
balance
my
favorite
beer
by
deschutes
and
my
favorite
stout
ever
flys
off
the
shelf
all
the
components
of
a
solid
stout
are
here
notes
of
cocoa
coffee
and
roasted
dark
malt
all
combined
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
good
but
not
great
overall
some
sweet
chocolate
and
heavily
roasted
burnt
chocolate
malts
with
a
little
coffee
and
a
bitter
burnt
finish
a
little
too
burnt
for
me
wish
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smelled
but
its
still
a
decent
stout
overall
i
liked
this
one
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
lived
up
to
its
hype
i
will
have
to
revisit
and
review
again
some
time
full
body
low
to
medium
carbonation
mostly
smooth
hops
are
a
bit
abrasive
in
the
finish
and
feel
a
little
out
of
place
overall
very
good
for
a
standard
easy
to
find
stout
a
little
heavier
than
i
expected
but
very
good
for
standards
i
really
like
firestones
velvet
merlin
inexpensive
and
very
good
and
refreshing
this
is
a
solid
allaround
stout
nothing
stands
out
but
nothing
is
lacking
there
are
a
few
others
i
would
select
before
this
stout
however
this
brew
has
an
advantage
because
it
is
readily
available
in
the
area
solid
good
on
all
fronts
definitely
a
goto
stout
othis
one
doesnt
do
anything
to
crazy
its
just
very
solid
draft
nitro
into
5
oz
sampler
appearance
is
impenetrable
black
beautiful
rising
head
resembling
a
cappuccino
aroma
is
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
subtle
hops
flavor
is
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
caramel
followed
by
bitter
hops
mouth
feel
is
medium
full
not
font
or
bubbly
the
nitro
i
guess
overall
this
is
a
really
outstanding
stout
noticeably
richer
in
flavor
than
the
bottled
equivalent
i
have
at
home
right
now
love
it
o
excellent
stout
o
in
the
debate
of
stout
vs
porter
and
contrasts
and
similarities
of
each
it
appears
that
deschutes
has
made
the
distinction
between
the
two
their
porter
being
their
black
butte
by
making
this
beer
certainly
damn
roasty
and
bitter
while
their
porter
highlights
more
of
a
dynamic
cerealcakey
malt
foundation
and
more
pronounced
chocolaty
flavor
this
stout
though
is
an
easy
and
safe
sell
to
those
who
havent
had
it
fantastic
o
i
never
found
deschutes
to
be
the
most
outspoken
brewery
around
and
with
beers
like
this
they
dont
have
to
be
everything
deschutes
has
to
say
gets
said
as
you
take
a
sip
of
their
brews
and
obsidian
stout
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
deschutes
is
all
about
theres
no
gimmicks
or
arrogance
here
just
a
divine
stout
from
a
company
who
knows
how
to
brew
legendary
beer
this
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
for
a
stout
especially
one
called
obsidian
nevertheless
its
unique
and
drinkable
overall
very
balanced
and
tasty
sweet
ranked
obsidian
the
highest
with
barney
flats
second
and
sn
stout
slightly
behind
in
third
flavor
lots
of
chocolates
sweet
and
bitter
hops
come
as
the
beer
warms
the
alcohol
wraps
itself
on
the
young
along
with
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
once
again
a
heavyhanded
aggro
pour
caused
a
pseudocascade
as
threeplus
fingers
of
dense

head
formed
with
excellent
retention
and
everything
went
on

obsidian
indeed
as
the
initial
head
settled
i
continued
my
pour
and
now
it
looked
like
a
muffin
top
protruding
from
the
glass
will
this
head
ever
subside
the
nose
smelled
like
devils
food
cake
rich
chocolaty
slightly
smoky
underlain
by
a
coffeelike
odor
it
smelled
like
a
birthday
cake
that
i
had
when
i
was
really
young
like
5
yo
chocolate
with
purple
icing
dig
that
i
was
obsessed
with
purple
when
i
was
really
young
and
my
cake
played
into
it
mouthfeel
was
big
dense
and
creamy
and
the
chocolate
cake
was
having
espresso
as
a
chaser
phew
you
had
better
really
like
those
kinds
of
intense
flavors
in
combination
with
one
another
and
since
i
am
the
king
of
intensity
it
was
right
up
my
alley
beautiful
lacing
began
to
form
as
i
drank
so
i
sat
back
and
watched
it
do
its
thing
while
taking
a
contemplative
moment
for
myself
finish
was
exceptionally
smooth
i
had
drank
down
almost
half
of
it
without
a
second
thought
at
6

abv
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
get
people
interested
in
the

brewed
up

nice
stout
by

very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
an
excellent
session
stout
that
beats
the
pants
off
of
guinness
and
comparable
offerings
its
flavorful
without
becoming
cloying
albeit
not
especially
complex
and
highly
drinkable
on
account
of
the
smooth
airy
mouthfeel
ive
not
tried
anything
else
by
deschutes
thus
far
but
this
was
a
good
start
o
strong
in
everything
but
aroma
and
taste
even
besides
the
meek
nature
of
those
components
the
flavors
just
didnt
stand
out
to
me
a
picture
of
it
could
be
considered
fine
art
but
beyond
that
i
have
a
few
other
favorite
milk
stouts
to
which
ill
be
returning
instead
poured
from
bottle
into
chilled
pint
glass
deep
dark
color
with
beautiful
thick
brown
head
which
slowly
dissipated
to
thin
band
of
bubbles
great
retention
and
lacing
and
the
nose
inviting
scent
of
dark
roasted
chocolate
portends
something
truly
special
and
yet
on
the
palate
the
taste
was
startlingly
thin
and
disappointing
i
was
expecting
something
much
warmer
and
seductive
but
instead
found
the
taste
to
be
bitter
thin
and
sadly
cheap
like
somebody
poured
miller
lite
in
my
stout
not
sure
ill
finish
the
six
pack

one
of

screen
overall
nothing
fanatical
but
a
solid
stout
o
im
rarely
disappointed
with
beer
from
deschutes
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
it
is
a
good
stout
very
drinkable
but
also
complex
definitely
one
of
the
more
hoppy
stouts
i
have
tried
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
reuslting
in
a
smooth
23
somewhat
foamy
13
mouthfeel
that
is
suitable
for
the
beer
and
the
style
ethanol
not
detectable
closes
dry
with
heavy
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
and
lips
o
black
as
coal
obsidian
stout
is
a
gorgeous
looking
beer
that
has
simple
layers
of
roasted
malt
complexity
in
the
aroma
transforming
from
sweetish
to
bitter
in
flavor
balanced
by
a
sharp
level
of
hops
smooth
and
robust
this
dark
stout
is
a
hefty
beer
to
sip
deschutes
obsidian
stout
45
outstanding
beer
and
the
flavor
and
experience
that
comes
through
given
the
abv
means
you
can
have
more
than
1
and
enjoy
anytime
this
was
a
bottle
poured
into
a
stout
glass
the
appearance
is
superb
that
nice
dark
ruby
color
with
a
mocha
head
just
looks
delicious
as
far
as
the
smell
its
certainly
not
bad
but
you
definitely
pick
up
plenty
of
alcohol
maybe
a
little
coffee
something
along
the
lines
of
an
italian
roast
the
smell
certainly
isnt
bad
but
would
lead
you
to
believe
this
beer
might
be
harsh
on
the
palate
but
its
not
as
far
as
the
mouthfeel
just
perfect
nice
creamy
no
serious
carbonation
and
what
is
there
works
well
as
far
as
taste
wow
its
all
there
everything
youd
expect
the
first
wave
is
some
not
so
subtle
barley
with
some
not
so
subtle
malt
but
then
some
subtle
dark
chocolate
and
a
slight
punch
of
that
italian
roast
coffee
it
all
balances
amazing
with
a
relatively
high
alcohol
content
so
be
careful
just
a
remarkable
stout
with
amazing
balance
and
exceptional
craftsmanship
or
call
it
whatever
youd
like
just
very
well
done
overall
an
enjoyable
stout
for
a
good
price
i
do
think
i
prefer
fw
velvet
merlin
though
for
the
stronger
flavor
profile
and
better
mouthfeel
medium
body
stout
on
the
edge
of
thin
great
color
and
consistency
definitely
let
it
sit
in
your
mouth
for
an
extra
moment
very
good
stout
but
its
missing
that
extra
touch
that
would
make
it
great
you
wont
regret
buying
it
but
not
sure
if
youd
take
this
one
home
to
mom
o
im
really
pleased
with
this
beer
hadnt
tried
it
before
but
i
will
definitely
be
getting
it
again
deschutes
typically
nails
it
but
no
easy
as
herethe
beer
speaks
for
itself
highly
recommended
pours
a
very
dark
brown
hue
which
leaves
a
massive
dimple
laden
rocky
head
lacing
absolutely
everywherethe
smell
is
dark
roasty
maltsbarley
and
rich
mochathe
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
with
tastes
of
rich
dark
chocolateroasty
toasty
maltsa
herbal
earthy
hoppiness
and
finished
with
a
chocolate
bittersweetness
and
overall
its
not
bad
and
drinkable
but
nothing
exuberant
cheers
this
is
a
very
robust
and
bold
flavored
beer
for
sure
one
of
my
favorites
following
an
afternoon
on
bachelor
7
99
for
a
6
pk
o
excellent
robust
american
stout
instant
favorite
of
mine
for
the
style
will
have
again
worth
seeking
out
a
deep
inky
black
with
just
enough
transparency
to
flash
brown
and
red
here
and
there
with
some
mochacolored
foam
and
an
aroma
of
roasted
barley
dark
sugar
and
hints
of
fruit
and
american
hops
pine
but
just
a
wee
bit
go
slow
with
this
one
it
is
intricate
yet
powerful
a
sip
reveals
deep
roasted
flavors
right
out
of
the
gate
but
there
is
a
surprisingly
clean
crisp
finish
you
expect
this
to
hang
there
like
some
massive
imperial
and
certainly
the
sweetness
does
accumulate
but
theres
more
going
on
than
just
syrupy
smoky
malt
strong
acidic
coffee
molasses
and
dark
chocolate
flavors
give
this
beer
a
classic
stout
character
while
some
dark
fruit
raisintype
notes
add
complexity
body
is
dextrinous
and
chewy
but
its
easy
to
forget
that
this
is
a
big
beer
considering
the
crisp
finish
with
aromatic
hop
echoes
and
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetsour
persistence
that
most
certainly
pays
off
creamy
and
smooth
the
alcohol
lurks
in
there
like
a
spectre
only
the
faintest
hint
of
a
boozy
presence
superb
balance
and
carbonation
level
once
you
go
obsidian
you
may
never
go
back
this
creature
is
blended
so
well
and
kind
to
the
tongue
just
a
dram
of
extra
ethanol
would
elevate
it
to
near
perfection
by
lifting
the
nose
and
adding
a
warm
edge
to
the
flavor
and
feel
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
it
is
highly
complex
and
offers
a
lot
from
a
beautiful
appearance
to
a
lot
of
different
flavors
from
bitter
to
sweet
to
roasted
coffee
this
is
one
of
the
better
stouts
that
i
have
had
and
i
definitely
recommend
it
o
i
really
like
it
it
is
really
satisfying
and
tasty
i
moved
to
portland
or
metro
area
in
2003
and
always
loved
how
the
pacific
nw
caters
to
stout
lovers
i
have
drunk
a
lot
of
beer
in
my
life
much
of
it
bad
and
though
i
always
liked
how
the
microbrew
phenomena
coincided
with
my
achieving
legal
drinking
age
sadly
though
the
atlantic
seaboard
does
not
carry
many
dark
beers
hence
my
equal
love
for
ipas
back
to
the
review
im
not
a
beer
geek
but
i
love
well
crafted
things
in
general
deschutes
brewing
has
always
been
great
with
balancing
fine
beer
with
mass
production
except
maybe
for
jubelale
and
obsidian
stout
has
been
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
10
years
running
equal
layers
of
coffee
chocolate
with
a
slight
tobacco
and
leathery
sweetness
yes
ive
tasted
leather
the
mouthfeel
is
like
real
maple
syrup
consistency
with
a
whipped
foam
coffee
aftertaste
just
bitter
enough
to
remind
you
that
bitter
is
a
masculine
taste
profile
the
beer
is
hearty
like
a
bowl
of
chunky
soup
without
the
chunks
it
drinks
likes
meal
if
you
find
this
on
nitro
get
it
as
it
lightens
the
beer
while
adding
richness
second
only
to
alameda
black
bear
on
nitro
but
tops
on
a
regularly
available
beer
of
any
kind
i
have
loved
european
beer
for
far
longer
but
have
a
difficult
time
justifying
their
cost
when
craft
brewers
like
deschutes
keep
it
real
this
is
the
best
value
of
any
stout
on
the
market
folks
enjoy
it
when
you
can
overall
this
is
brilliant
im
buying
a
six
pack
very
soon
overall
an
outstanding
beer
and
one
i
could
easily
drink
everyday
each
sip
is
very
tasty
and
complex
and
overall
this
was
a
damn
good
stout
that
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
dangerously
drinkable
due
to
the
6
4
abv
and
a
definite
recommendation
heavenly
seek
it
out
o
one
of
the
best
accessible
stouts
out
there
this
one
has
suffered
a
bit
from
age
but
still
quite
good
wish
deschutes
distributed
out
here
cappaccino
appearance
poured
into
the
glass
like
sweet
black
oil
leaving
a
nice
looking
coffee
foam
head
doesnt
have
that
ashtray
aftertaste
that
so
many
stouts
can
have
perfect
initial
taste
follows
through
with
a
medium
roast
flavor
its
a
beautiful
beer
final
thoughts
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
a
good
stout
for
those
looking
for
robust
dark
malt
flavor
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
nitrotap
would
probably
be
worth
seeking
out
this
seems
like
a
pedestrian
dark
beer
at
first
sip
but
it
grows
on
you
extremely
drinkable
with
a
lot
of
fat
malty
flavors
ill
have
to
get
a
six
of
the
bottles
this
seems
like
a
flavorful
easy
to
drink
brew
to
have
around
overall
a
great
looking
stout
especially
impressive
was
the
nice
cap
the
head
was
reduced
to
like
a
cappuccino
impressive
nose
with
that
nice
medium
roasted
coffee
smell
i
felt
like
the
body
could
have
been
a
bit
more
well
stout
it
was
a
little
too
slick
and
thin
for
my
liking
though
the
carbonation
was
perfect
that
aside
a
great
american
stout
that
would
go
well
with
most
desserts
in
my
case
a
cake
doughnut
never
had
such
an
incredible
mouthfeel
fall
so
one
dimensional
aroma
was
muted
and
taste
was
offset
with
a
metallic
taste
cold
draft
to
even
warmed
up
mehhh
feels
more
like
a
porter
or
even
pretty
close
to
their
black
butte
porter
sowwy
o
outstanding
aroma
and
flavor
having
all
of
the
dark
malt
notes
of
chocolate
coffee
and
a
a
touch
of
burnt
bitterness
along
with
some
hops
bitterness
its
fairly
dry
with
and
smooth
its
pretty
evident
why
the
beer
has
earned
so
many
awards
o
a
nice
american
stout
not
overbearing
but
hearty
and
tasty
overall
just
a
good
american
stout
nothing
too
special
but
easy
drinking
and
tasty
bonus
points
for
being
lower
in
abv
but
tasting
just
as
good
as
any
of
the
10ers
you
wont
be
disappointed
here
overall
a
very
solid
stout
nothing
fancy
or
exciting
here
but
everything
youd
expect
out
of
a
good
stout
overall
its
good
would
most
definitely
get
again
but
not
seek
it
out
if
i
cant
get
it
locally
poured
to
a
very
nice
deep
robust
and
rich
creamy
foamy
head
topping
this
very
good
roasted
malt
and
black
barley
beer
giving
way
to
notes
of
coffee
a
definite
beer
to
buy
again
and
enjoy
very
similiar
to
guiness
foreign
extra
but
not
quite
the
bitterness
summary
pretty
nice
stout
ive
liked
some
other
stuff
from
deschutes
but
this
is
definitely
now
one
of
my
favorites
of
theirs
typically
i
will
enjoy
a
stout
if
it
refrains
from
pounding
me
with
its
roastedness
this
one
has
just
the
right
amount
to
be
enjoyable
o
was
very
excited
for
this
one
my
first
form
deschutes
nose
was
huge
taste
a
little
below
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
especially
those
who
love
a
less
smooth
stout
spot
on
with
the
bitterness
and
hops
overall
ok
but
the
ashtray
association
was
a
little
disconcerting
o
as
ive
alluded
to
this
is
the
gold
standard
of
stouts
as
far
as
im
concerned
im
only
out
west
for
the
summer
but
i
already
know
that
im
gonna
grab
a
few
sixers
of
these
babies
for
when
im
back
on
the
other
side
of
the
mississippi
a
spicy
strong
entry
to
the
stout
canon
altogether
familiar
and
yet
like
nothing
youve
ever
had
before
a
triumph
o
what
a
delight
this
is
a
rich
and
thoughtful
beer
worth
a
taste
its
the
kind
of
stout
you
could
easily
make
a
session
of
overall
just
a
well
crafted
brew
and
definitely
my
favorite
thus
far
from
deschutes
pours
out
to
a
creamy
beige
head
and
deep
ruby
black
color
aroma
is
smoky
roasty
espressolike
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
earthy
hops
flavor
is
roasted
barley
toasted
malts
vanilla
esters
and
a
balance
of
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
heavy
with
creamy
nitro
goodness
top
notch
stuff
must
have
again
i
was
about
to
give
up
on
stouts
until
obsidian
arrived
at
the
table
this
is
a
solid
stout
all
the
way
around
o
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
for
the
most
part
the
malt
and
charred
qualities
sort
of
overtook
the
nuance
but
the
overall
effect
is
still
rather
good
great
brew
a
fantastic
stout
i
am
only
upset
that
it
took
this
long
for
me
to
figure
it
out
overall
an
excellent
stout
though
its
not
too
far
off
from
their
black
butte
in
terms
of
flavor
this
ones
a
little
darker
but
the
basic
flavor
profile
is
there
a
classic
example
in
every
sense
of
the
way
if
theres
one
gripe
i
have
and
its
a
small
one
its
that
the
sweetness
can
get
a
touch
cloying
when
drinking
this
beer
too
fast
a
virtual
catch
22
because
this
beer
is
so
enjoyable
its
hard
not
to
want
to
take
drink
after
drink
in
quick
succession
well
i
did
not
expect
this
from
a
nonimperial
stout
it
basically
has
the
flavor
of
an
imperial
stout
sans
the
high
abv
if
there
are
any
lovers
of
imperial
stouts
out
there
who
are
skeptial
of
a
regular
stouts
capacity
to
sufficiently
satisfy
their
selachian
and
senual
cravings
for
scrumptious
stouts
you
must
try
this
now
or
i
will
annihilate
you
with
my
aggravating
alliterative
abilities
the
label
on
the
neck
of
the
bottle
reads
give
in
to
the
deep
dark
spell
as
the
layers
unfold
and
like
the
plot
of
some
eerie
mystery
you
cant
put
down
haha

d
a

stout
from

known

its
juggernaut
imperial
stout
refreshingly
light
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
especially
given
the
full
flavor
balanced
complex
and
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
medium

light
for

carbonation
is
high
coffee
notes
are
strong
throughout
booze
is
low
infact
not
really
noticable
at
all
this
beer
should
be
drank
at

temp

fridge
temps
seriously
hurt
the
flavor
on
the
palate
overall
though
a
good
stout
from
deschutes
i
was
hoping
for
more
but
not
bad
at
all
drinkability
great
the
rich
flavors
coupled
with
the
very
smooth
feel
in
your
mouth
makes
this
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
repeatedly
this
beer
will
be
a
part
of
the
regular
rotation
overall
this
is
a
balanced
and
delicious
stout
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
again
next
time
i
have
the
opportunity
i
do
wish
the
booziness
was
more
well
hidden
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
nice

definitely
will
be
picking
this
up
again

great
beer
the
smoke

flavors
would
probably
keep
me
from
ordering
more
than
one
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium

the
finish
is

this
is
a

the

a
bit
of
coffee
grounds
with
smooth
creamy
finish
not
to
sweet
but
dead
on
with
the
style
and
one
that
i
truly
enjoyed
overall
this
is
one
fine
damn
offering
of
a
stout
hands
down
one
of
the
best
stouts
on
the
face
of
the
planet
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
to
black
coloration
with
a
subtle
golden
mocha
head
that
leaves
little
remnant
of
its
presence
on
the
glass
aroma
profile
is
a
rich
blend
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
slight
licorice
taste
is
beyond
comparison
plenty
of
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
definitive
hoppy
finish
to
drown
the
palate
in
beery
ecstasy
making
the
lucky
imbiber
want
to
take
in
more
of
this
delicious
nectar
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
best
around
not
thin
but
chunky
and
chewy
with
lots
of
texture
drinkability
is
surprisingly
high
its
not
uncommon
for
me
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
while
enjoying
the
world
go
by
believe
it
or
not
it
makes
the
movie
bound
even
better
and
in
a
way
it
is
the
jennifer
tilly
of
the
beer
world
a
sumptuous
vixen
with
legs
that
dont
stop
and
a
mind
that
keeps
you
questioning
the
existence
of
your
very
being
d
very
very
drinkable
a
solid
american
stout
with
classic
flavors
from
a
brewery
that
has
yet
to
disappoint
if
it
werent
for
the
mouthfeel
this
would
be
an
exceptional
beer
for
sure
overall
perhaps
one
of
the
best
or
simply
the
best
readily
available
american
stouts
priced
at
a
value
i
have
seen
sixpacks
for
7
99
for
a
world
class
stout
that
is
hard
to
match
another
solid
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
overall
another
really
killer
beer
from
deschutes
every
beer
ive
had
from
them
has
been
at

above

d
a

discovery
for
me
and
one
of
my
new

stouts
i
could
drink
these
all
night
quite
an
accomplishment
given
the
moderately
high
abv
of
6
4
getting
close
to
imperial
stout
ranges
highly
reccommended
d
i
have
to
say
this
really
is
a
terrrific
stout
has
some
complexities
and
intensities
of
an
imperial
but
at
a
standard
alcohol
level
what
more
could
you
ask
for
a
truly
sessionable
imperial
stout
i
do
wish
the
flavors
were
more
multidimensional
to
match
the
aroma
but
it
really
is
hard
to
complain
about
this
one
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
definitely
was
not
on
my
radar
but
will
be
now
thats
why
we
trade
right
excellent
stout
highly
recommended

obsidian

of
toasted
malt
chocolate
and
dark

three
hallmarks
of
a
good

d
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
american
stout
bold
where
it
needs
to
be
and
graceful
in
all
the
right
places
has
all
the
elements
of
a
wonderfully
crafted
beer
cheers
to
deschutes
for
this
one
a
good
almost
great
session
beer
enjoyable
but
not
quite
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
for
definitely
could
enjoy
as
few
but
there
are
better
stouts
out
in
my
area
that
i
would
drink
rather
than
trade
for
this
again
thanks
sugit
for
such
a
bold
dry
taste
and
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
it
manages
to
go
down
smooth
with
a
smack
of
tart
bitterness
at
the
end
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
in
the
flavor
but
given
the
huge
flavoring
id
consider
this
of
only
average
drinkability
for
a
stout
this
one
was
big
and
bold
in
the
flavor
with
good
aggressive
hopping
pretty
awesome
stout
d
well
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
beer
but
i
did
enjoy
every
sip
of
it
i
really
enjoyed
the
intoxicating
aroma
with
an
unexpected
note
of
charcoal
and
the
richhearty
flavor
profile
very
drinkable
for
6
4
abv
around
2
pints
for
me
it
doesnt
get
overly
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
its
definitely
worth
seeking
out
cheers
edit
head
is
more
brown
than
tan
big
coffee
hit
in
the
nose
and
the
hops
are
very
noticeable
pretty
good
effervescence
this
might
have
been
a
fresher
bottle
than
first
review
bump
up
smell
score
and
taste
score
not
a
high
abv
version
but
one
of
the
tastiest
stouts
to
be
found
this
is
a
longtime
favorite
of
mine
and
a
stout
that
stacks
up
well
next
to
many
of
the
imperialdouble
stouts
despite
coming
in
at
a
relatively
low
6
4
very
nice
stout
for
any
time
of
the
year
deschutes
you
are
truly
great
dthis
is
extremely
tasty
but
the
burning
seems
to
take
away
from
it
it
is
quite
powerful
for
a
regular
stout
and
i
would
seek
it
out
again
this
is
truly
one
of
the
greats
not
just
in
its
style
but
in
the
beer
world
period
drinkability
definitely
one
of
the
most
drinkable
richlyflavored
dark
beers
ive
ever
had
its
flavor
builds
on
the
palate
so
theres
a
cumulative
effect
at
work
here
but
the
flavor
is
just
so
smooth
and
lacking
in
detriments
that
i
dont
mind
a
classic
warming
and
welcoming
drink
this
on
a
cold
night
this
is
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
during
the
winter
months
but
im
in
arizona
and
its
sunny
and
75
degrees
good
nonetheless
taste
is
very
smooth
with
bakers
chocolate
maltiness
leading
the
way
a
tad
roasty
and
toasty
while
the
hops
are
more
subtle
than
the
nose
indicates
still
pretty
bitter
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
very
smooth
and
adequately
full
mouthfeel
while
this
is
not
deschutes
finest
offering
it
is
a
damn
tasty
stout
more
please
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
rich
full
thick
and
creamy
strong
roasted
coffee
finish
with
a
bit
of
a
bitterness
from
it
but
not
overwhelming
carbonation
is
low
adds
to
drinkability
for
the
style
finish
is
a
bit
too
bitter
for
me
but
its
decent
that
deep
taste
of
chococoffee
never
fades
it
becomes
even
more
drinkable
throughout
the
bottle
while
ive
had
other
deschutes
stuff
that
at
times
tastes
inconsistent
ive
had
numerous
obsidian
stouts
in
various
forms
and
never
ever
has
any
of
them
been
anything
short
of
magnifique
overall
an
above
average
stout
a
really
fantastic
beer
everything
is
very
well
balanced
with
no
component
totally
overwhelming
this
is
one
of
those
rare
american
stouts
that
one
can
drink
a
lot
of
truly
one
of
the
best
overall
a
very
good
stout
i
wish
this
was
available
in
my
area
d
nicely
blended
very
tasty
not
very
filling
this
is
one
of
the
better
stouts
that
i
have
had
recently
with
a
reasonable
abv
if
they
distributed
here
it
would
be
one
i
buy
frequently
d
impressive
and
satisfying
this
stout
walks
the
fine
line
of
subtle
and
flavorful
just
beautifully
d
very
drinkable
this
one
was
awesome
to
drink
loved
it
world
classall
of
the
aspects
of
a
great
stout
mixed
together
in
one
bottle
the
finish
is
warming
and
a
med
body
that
leaves
notes
of
coffee
in
the
nasal
this
is
a
great
stout
and
its
even
better
that
it
comes
in
six
packs
and
doesnt
cost
an
arm
and
a
leg
a
true
standby
this
is
my
first
written
review
i
hope
it
didnt
suck
d
damn
skippy
this
one
is
a
keeper
i
find
it
more
enjoyable
with
each
sip
a
decent
stout
not
as
much
roasted
malt
as
i
thought
there
was
going
to
be
and
there
are
two
different
bitter
flavors
that
are
at
odds
with
each
other
one
from
the
chocolate
and
one
from
the
hops
this
is
worth
a
try
but
not
one
of
there
better
beers
overall
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
values
out
there
often
in
the
sub7
dollar
range
for
a
sixer
quality
like
this
at
that
price
is
one
of
lifes
small
pleasures

d
not

would
like
to
see
the
burnt

supplemented
with
some
malty

though
drinkability
an
excellent
stout
that
i
could
have
several
ofespecially
if
i
could
find
it
around
here
nice
and
smooth
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
an
excellent
first
experience
with
this
brewery
d
loved
it
burnt
and
heavy
roasted
malts
maybe
even
some
smokey
malts
hints
of
vanilla
and
mocha
liek
sweetness
for
this
dark
stout
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
these
deepite
the
abv
and
the

this
beer
is
so
chock
full
of

i
could

thsi
till
i
burst
d
really
nice

coffeechocolate

i
really
wish
i
could
get
deschutes
out
here
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
stout
rich
enough
to
satisfy
without
making
it
too
overbearing
ill
have
to
try
it
on
nitro
sometime
smooth
and
creamy
light
and
utterly
drinkable
this
could
def
become
my
new
stout
of
choice
the
finish
is
a
clean
hop
bitterness
with
some
roast
and
light
malt
character
pours
black
with
a
red
tint
a
onefingered
head
forms
but
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
cap
just
a
little
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
a
complex
blend
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
leather
and
smoke
or
ash
there
is
a
lot
going
on
with
this
stout
the
flavor
is
complex
as
well
roasted
malt
gives
the
base
with
a
burnt
bitterness
but
there
is
also
bitter
chocolate
some
dark
dried
fruit
like
prunes
and
finishes
with
an
ash
smokey
flavor
overall
bitterness
is
moderate
to
high
hard
to
pick
out
any
sweetness
in
this
one
in
fact
it
makes
it
a
little
difficult
to
drink
has
a
hardy
body
but
it
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
making
it
seem
lighter
than
it
really
is
an
outstanding
stout
that
packs
a
lot
of
different
elements
in
if
you
like
bitter
flavors
drinkability
i
like
it
great
beer
for
a
cold
night
pretty
good
stout
but
i
have
seen
better
ones
out
there
overall
its
something
you
can
try
but
nothing
fascinating
to
pick
up
again
i
would
love
to
have
more
of
this
but
i
never
see
it
in
the
midwest
this
is
very
drinkable
maybe
my
favorite
ale
in
deschutes
very
fine
year
round
lineup
a
great
beer
and
very
affordable
in
salem
or
often
available
for
6
99
a
sixer
on
sale
great
value
overall
impression
very
satisfied
with
the
beer
very
aromatic
for
a
stout
i
could
smell
the
beer
before
even
coming
close
to
the
glass
the
lingering
taste
in
your
mouth
after
this
beer
will
remind
you
what
a
fine
chocolate
stout
you
just
enjoyed
the
most
impressive
aspect
is
the
balance
with
the
deep
roasted
malts
and
hops
the
bitterness
is
hardly
noticeable
this
beer
was
exciting
to
drink
it
felt
like
the
immage
one
would
have
of
a
kid
in
a
candy
store
in
their
mind
if
they
didnt
mind
thining
about
kids
in
candy
stores
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
fairly
drinkable
with
a
big
flavor
i
dont
think
it
would
be
too
hard
to
have
another
one
of
these
in
the
night
give
this
one
a
shot
its
pretty
good
while
i
dont
normally
enjoy
beers
served
on
nitro
i
would
certainly
order
this
one
again
i
would
enjoy
reviewing
this
beer
carbonated
with
co2
as
opposed
to
nitro
and
compare
the
differences
d
i
started
it
thinking
how
sessionable
it
was
bit
before
i
even
finished
i
had
to
second
guess
that
i
really
enjoyed
one
but
would
move
on
to
something
else
after
d
top
notch
a
fantastic
stout
well
crafted
another
and
another
and
another
please
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
stout
that
i
wish
was
readily
available
to
me
in
massachusetts
unfortunately
it
isnt
so
i
relished
the
opportunity
to
taste
this
and
enjoyed
it
down
until
the
very
last
sip
very
nice
nitro
version
how
about
serving
this
one
with
a
mole
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
standard
stouts
ive
had
recently
and
the
jekyll
hyde
type
taste
is
very
unique
and
well
executed
overall
impression
a
rock
solid
stout
sessionable
yet
assertive
great
stuff
d
would
not
feel
guilty
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
well
done
drinkability
a
great
break
from
studying
for
the
lsat
this
is
truly
a
stunning
stout
too
bad
it
is
entirely
unavailable
in
my
area
overall
its
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
can
only
imagaine
it
would
be
exceptional
allaround
if
it
was
served
on
nitro
future
outlook
obtained
in
a
trade
and
not
available
here
the
price
is
apparantly
quite
reasonable
once
you
pair
that
with
the
superb
quality
it
makes
it
a
damn
shame
that
it
is
unavailable
here
pours
a
deep
black
with

quickly
fell

a

deliciously
chocolatey
malty

bitter
mouthfeel
is

wonderfully
complimenting
the
taste
drinkability
is
absurdly
good
i
would
love
more
of
these
there
is
something
in
the
dry
finish
though
i
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
with
but
certainly
not
much
of
a
detractor
this
is
more
than
likely
the
best
american
stout
out
there
so
close
to
being
perfect
d
very
drinkable
not
sessionable
really
but
its
a
good
treat
and
id
like
to
use
it
for
a
float
too
and
the
darkness
of
obsidian
stout
quelled
my
passions
d
starts
out
good
and
enjoyable
but
by
the
time
i
finish
i
need
to
wash
my
mouth
out
from
the
after
taste
drinkability
at
6
4
abv
this
might
be
a
slightly
more
sessionable
stout
the
richness
and
the
complexity
of
the
taste
profile
challenge
you
to
drink
just
one
if
i
had
more
in
the
fridge
there
would
be
more
going
down
the
hatch
tonight
oh
well
all
in
all
this
is
one
hell
of
an
american
stout
d
smooth
filling
and
tasty
just
another
day
with

like
this
brew
alot
great

recommend
note
this
was
not
the
best
bottle
of
obsidian
ive
encountered
its
usually
quite
a
bit
more
even
like
a
good
cup
of
coffee
not
too
sweet
or
bitter
but
complex
and
full
maybe
it
was
me
maybe
it
was
the
brew
either
way
i
have
given
this
a
combined
rating
which
may
change
the
next
time
i
buy
a
bottle
or
order
one
out
if
you
like
a
well
made
stout
grab
this
one
if
you
dont
like
stouts
you
should
still
try
this
because
you
may
be
very
surprised
at
this
price
who
can
not
like
this
beer
d
drinks
lighter
than
it
is
a
very
nice
stout
that
i
can
drink
too
much
of
if
im
not
careful
the
simple
flavor
profile
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
d
i
will
preface
it
with
this
is
one
of
my
top
styles
it
goes
without
saying
not
a
session
beer
for
me
i
see
this
beer
widely
available
out
here
in
sd
i
need
to
remember
how
lucky
i
am
for
that
great
solid
stout
d
a
great
american
stout
at
a
low
abv
which
is
great
in
this
land
of
imperials
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
i
would
drink
a
few
the
burnt
malt
may
wear
thin
after
some
time
either
way
this
was
a
treat
and
i
would
drink
again
would
like
to
try
a
freshie

very
sessionable
stout
this
is
one
stout
that
you
could
have
a
few
of
over
the
course
of
a
night
overall
a
great
beer
very
refreshing
aromas
flavors
and
mouth
feel
combine
to
offer
both
complexity
and
variety
its
not
transcendent
by
any
means
but
it
is
highly
enjoyable
and
at
an
abv
of
6
4
virtually
a
session
beer
that
invites
repeated
pourings
and
indulgences
pitch
black
big
frothy
dirty
head
looks
amazing
aroma
has
tons
of
roasted
malts
hint
of
sweetness
creamy
medium
to
full
bodied
balanced
fantastic
bittering
dangerously
drinkable
completely
blown
away
by
my
first
descutes
experience
i
like
most
everything
i
have
drank
from
deschutes
so
i
wasnt
worried
about
this
one
it
pours
black
into
the
glass
with
a
big
frothy
head
with
good
lacing
as
the
pint
got
lower
smells
roasty
milk
chocolate
coffee
some
vanilla
and
a
little
doughy
taste
faintly
of
bitter
coffee
and
some
chocolate
full
bodied
creamy
good
beer
another
exceptional
beer
from
deschutes
d
this
beer
alone
was
worth
the
1
5
mile
walk
to
the
liquor
store
from
my
hotel
as
far
as
american
stouts
go
this
one
is
near
the
top
d
this
beer
was
a
wonderful
example
of
a
stout
lots
of
flavors
and
complexity
to
it
a
great
beer
to
bad
deschutes
does
not
distribute
down
here
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
and
tannic
thanks
to
sparky27
for
sharing
this
one
as
far
as
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
go
the
beer
has
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
and
is
not
too
thick
for
a
stout
it
pours
thicker
than
it
drinks
that
is
for
sure
the
alcohol
is
not
very
pronounced
and
it
has
a
complex
mix
of
sweet
and
bitter
flavors
that
make
it
very
enjoyable
d
for
the
style
very
drinkability
a
phenomenal
beer
one
of
the
best
american
stouts
ive
ever
had
and
a
firm
winner
from
deschutes
it
manages
to
strike
the
perfect
balance
in
a
lot
of
places
not
too
astringent
or
too
sweet
or
too
dry
and
has
plenty
of
complexity
to
go
around
all
in
a
reasonablysessionable
package
highly
recommended
first
sip
reveals
average
body
and
very
mild
carbonation
the
flavor
is
sweet
cocoa
for
a
second
and
rolls
to
some
roasted
malt
as
the
nose
predicted
i
dont
find
any
hop
presence
or
hints
of
abv
either
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
smooth
and
i
would
definitely
enjoy
this
brew
again
a
nice
version
of
a
good
stout
pick
up
a
bottle
or
6
if
you
see
it
d
despite
some
big
malt
attributes
i
though
this
was
as
close
to
a
session
stout
as
youd
want
actually
like
the
balance
the
asringency
i
couild
have
done
without
come
to
think
of
it
im
gonna
do
that
right
now
drinkability
have
deschutes
distribute
to
western
pa
and
see
how
fast
i
go
through
their
lineup
very
good
beer
d
i
guess
you
could
call
this
a
session
stout
as
its
quite
thin
and
refreshing
for
such
a
dark
beer
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
from
these
guys
minus
the
lingering
astrigency
it
would
get
a
lot
better
score
from
me
seriously
i
could
still
taste
it
10
minutes
after
i
finished
this
glass
of
beer
this
is
a
standout
beer
this
is
a
pretty
damn
drinkable
stout
definitely
something
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
d
i
want
this
beer
to
be
part
of
my
life
d
if
i
can
get
through
a
six
pack
of
it
and
it
is
a
stout
then
it
has
pretty
damn
good
drinkability
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
smells
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
tastes
of
coffee
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
bodied
this
is
very
good
stout
i
would
recommend
this
to
anybody
extremely
drinkable
stout
especially
with
the
abv
not
blowing
you
off
your
seat
nice
work
on
an
american
stout
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
not
too
big
not
too
small
this
beer
is
really
well
balanced
id
gladly
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
night
drinkability
very
easy
dinking
yet
a
substantial
beer
outstanding
overall
i
could
only
have
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
that
is
because
it
only
takes
one
to
be
satisfied
this
is
my
favorite
general
drinking
stout
a
rich
blackness
a
crisp
roasted
barley
aroma
full
bodied
without
being
overly
sweet
ive
always
loved
the
sharp
bite
from
the
roasted
malts
and
hop
bitterness
and
how
they
balance
the
chocolatey
malt
the
ethanol
is
perhaps
overly
apparent
with
this
beer
but
i
think
thats
a
defect
that
adds
a
little
charm
keeps
it
from
being
boring
same
goes
for
the
uncharacteristic
aggressive
hopping
this
is
a
flavor
profile
i
seek
to
emulate
in
my
homebrewed
stouts
3

picked
up
a
six
pack
for
6
99
at
albertsons
in
magnolia
wa
had
a
few
while
watching
the
seahawks
game
before
xmas
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
black
color
like
obsidian
to
borrow
from
the
name
brownish
white
head
decent
lacing
smelled
like
roasted
barley
and
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
noticeable
too
taste
was
way
above
average
dark
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
abound
in
this
brew
a
bit
dry
in
the
finish
and
like
i
said
after
a
few
the
alcohol
is
present
a
textbook
example
of
a
great
stout
from
an
excellent
american
brewer
taste
is
much
better
hoppy
for
an
american
stout
huge
malt
flavor
as
well
dark
viscous
truely
the
best
non
imperial
stout
i
have
ever
had
i
look
forward
to
having
this
in
the
bottle
form
drinkability
is
dangerously
high
if
you
like
american
stouts
this
is
one
of
the
best
period
the
fact
they
they
can
maintain
such
a
luscious
mouthfeel
in
the
bottle
is
a
true
testament
to
their
skill
a
masterpiece
side
note
their
bottles
have
some
nice
ornamentation
pours
jet
black
with
a
decent
tan
head
nice
lacing
aroma
is
thick
with
coffee
and
malt
the
flavor
is
very
smooth
the
bitter
coffee
and
chocolate
is
balanced
nicely
with
the
roastiness
of
the
malt
avoids
the
soysauce
bite
good
hop
bitterness
as
well
a
very
good
stout
a
solid
stout
especially
creamy
and
full
bodied
nothing
really
stands
out
for
me
but
its
still
a
damn
good
offering
non
the
less
overall
impression
i
have
always
loved
this
stout
but
i
must
admit
looking
at
this
with
a
critical
eye
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
its
aggressive
though
and
despite
the
abv
of
6
4
it
has
an
almost
imperial
stout
quality
and
the
bitterness
characteristic
of
a
west
coast
brew
locally
this
is
reasonably
priced
and
the
lower
abv
allows
it
to
be
an
excellent
session
stout
some
friends
whose
palates
i
admire
akbelgianbeast
for
example
just
dont
like
this
one
for
whatever
reason
i
do
it
is
not
a
speedway
or
abyss
or
berzerker
by
any
stretch
but
it
is
a
great
blue
collar
stout
in
my
book
even
way
out
in
rural
alaska
90
miles
by
sea
from
the
distributor
in
juneau
i
can
get
a
sixer
for
as
little
as
7
sometimes
8
50
this
time
d
this
is
a
absolute
drinker
for
sure
great
flavor
buttery
smooth
and
superb
balance
notes
another
delicious
offering
from
deschutes
brewery
a
rich
creamy
flavorful
stout
that
tastes
great
and
is
incredibly
smooth
easy
to
drink
and
a
pleasure
at
that
this
is
one
that
i
have
made
a
regular
in
my
beer
diet
a
truly
delicious
americanstyle
stout
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyand
quite
often
at
that
d
gotta
love
it
great
brew
and
easy
drinker
nice
flavors
throughout
d
this
is
a
very
flavorful
stout
quite
drinkable
d
again
it
is
a
nice
departure
from
the
strong
smoke
and
bitter
coffee
flavors
of
a
lot
of
stouts
and
is
quite
drinkable
for
a
stout
d
definitely
drinkable
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
bottle
this
one
has
a
bit
of
uniqueness
that
separates
it
from
the
generic
stout
but
that
also
makes
it
a
bit
strong
in
flavor
to
drink
a
ton
of
it
begins
to
wear
at
the
tastebuds
in
a
good
way
the
sweet
sour
roasted
and
burnt
flavors
are
incredible
but
take
a
turn
away
from
sessionability
in
my
mind
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
chance
if
nothing
else
than
do
see
what
a
stout
has
the
ability
to
be
this
one
nears
an
imperial
stout
in
the
best
ways
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
an
abundance
of
roasted
black
malts
with
espresso
and
cocoa
notes
the
taste
is
a
nice
abundance
of
fresh
espresso
cocoa
and
a
plethora
of
roasted
malts
the
beer
is
crisp
and
light
with
decent
carbonation
very
smooth
drinking
this
is
certainly
an
enjoyable
stout
one
that
i
would
love
to
see
here
on
the
east
coast
pours
a
midnight
black
with
some
faint
brownish
highlights
foamy
mocha
colored
head
fading
very
slowly
with
just
a
few
spots
of
lacing
left
in
the
glass
lots
of
milk
chocolate
in
the
nose
faint
coffee
and
nice
burntcharred
edges
taste
follows
right
along
just
the
perfect
amount
of
sweetness
nothing
overly
bitter
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
level
of
carbonation
this
is
just
plain
delicious
and
drinkability
is
completely
off
the
map
extremely
impressive
stout
good
beer
id
drink
it
again
happily
im
sorry
deschutes
i
really
tried
its
me
not
you
taste
mouth
feel
is
full
crisp
from
the
carbonation
dark
malts
produce
a
sweet
creamy
roasted
coffee
taste
and
bitterness
burnt
coffee
flavor
with
the
combination
of
hops
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
taste
mixed
in
here
also
this
beer
has
become
a
current
favorite
of
mine
and
i
highly
recommend
this
bier
to
friends
and
fellow
members
and
bier
drinkers
pours
dark
brown
with
three
fingers
of
chocolatychunky
head
that
leaves
some
massive
swiss
cheese
lacing
as
is
drops
at
a
snails
pace
the
nose
is
caramely
with
some
light
roasted
coffee
aromas
this
stout
is
rich
and
full
of
bitter
chocolates
and
burnt
coffeesome
good
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
tail
the
body
is
full
and
just
rite
for
my
likingthis
is
a
bit
dryand
could
use
a
touch
more
creaminessbut
overall
is
a
great
stout
with
lots
of
character
to
spare
very
quaffable
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
pours
a
solid
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
a
roasty
chocolaty
affair
with
some
dried
fruit
and
a
touch
of
hop
aroma
for
good
measure
taste
follows
the
smell
but
lingers
with
a
bit
of
ash
in
the
finish
full
body
creamy
texture
ample
carbonation
if
not
for
the
ash
in
the
finish
id
love
this
beer
as
is
its
still
good
just
not
spectacular
despite
the
darkness
and
abv
this
is
easily
a
session
beer
and
a
regular
purchase
of
mine
just
took
forever
to
get
around
to
reviewing
it
obsidian

a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
only
a
small
slice
of
a
ruby
red
highlight
peaks
through
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
sports
a
small
tan
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
its
got
a
big
nose
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
and
semi
sweet
coffee
beans
this
beer
is
a
roasted
master
piece
an
awesome
caliber
of
malt
quality
shines
through
right
away
followed
by
hints
of
caramel
and
coffee
a
great
balancing
hop
character
on
the
finish
and
a
bready
yeast
character
its
got
a
smooth

sticky
and
excellent

awesome
beer

i
could
get
it

brewery

i
am
starting
to
learn
about
in
the
mouth
its
mediumfull
not
superchewy
but
great
for

keep
things
in
line
great
american
stout
im
sad
ive
not
had
it
until
now
d
pretty
good
stout
honestly
i
prefer
less
dark
bitter
coffee
but
i
know
thats
exactly
what
a
lot
of
stout
lovers
are
looking
for
so
i
cant
fault
it
for
that
thanks
daniela
for
bringing
this
back
from
portland
poured
ohso
black
and
beautiful
a
lovely
looking
stout
bit
of
hop
aroma
roasty
aromas
for
sure
milky
and
semisweet
flavors
yum
it
had
a
wet
almost
to
porterish
mouthfeel
high
drinkability
only
the
mf
throwing
me
off
a
bit
id
love
to
have
this
on
draft
another
great
brew
from
a
so
far
impressive
brewery
thanks
again
bill
good
but
not
exceptional
overall
a
drinkable
beer
dark
but
not
overpowering
or
overly
filling
something
i
have
drunk
before
and
will
drink
again
dman
only
6
4
with
all
of
that
flavour
its
made
year
round
and
easily
accessable
fine
work
by
the
folk
at
deschutes
this
is
a
world
class
beer
imho
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
everyday
drinking
stouts
around
amazing
flavor
out
of
this
stout
making
it
my
new
go
to
for
stouts
happy
to
have
access
out
here
in
hawaii
highly
recommend
d
minus
being
overly
hopped
the
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
as
far
as
american
stouts
go
but
it
is
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
3
5
drinkability
very
smooth
we
were
expecting
something
a
little
more
challenging
we
dont
have
any
beef
with
this
stout
however
we
cant
see
any
reasons
to
seek
it
out
again
as
fas
as
american
standard
stouts
go
this
is
my
favorite
d
excellent
the
flavor
is
a
plethora
of
dark
rich
coffee
and
chocolate
which
coat
the
palate
with
a
milklike
sweetness
before
giving
way
to
a
dark
chocolate
and
spicy
organic
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
ubercreamy
velvety
thickbodied
and
oh
so
drinkable
but
tends
to
get
a
little
thinner
as
the
nitrogen
wears
down
all
in
all
an
excellent
beer
and
one
im
glad
i
got
to
try
not
only
straight
from
the
horses
mouth
but
on
nitrotap
too
this
is
deschutes
best
staple
beer
in
my
opinion
it
pours
a
nice
dark
blackish
color
and
has
a
thick
brown
head
the
nose
has
roasted
malts
dark
fruits
coffee
and
chocolate
balanced
by
bitter
floral
hops
the
taste
is
also
very
roasty
and
sweet
with
a
nice
bitterness
full
body
goes
down
well
d
this
is
a
tasty
but
not
overpowering
stout
id
like
to
drink
another
one
but
i
know
that
would
make
me
want
to
drink
a
third
and
then
d
its
a
stout
through
and
through
it
is
easy
to
drink
ive
shared
this
with
friends
and
i
hope
to
do
so
again
tasted
great
with
all
the
coffeechocolate
flavors
necessary
and
at
6
4
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
excellent
beer
and
i
hope
anyone
who
likes
stouts
gets
to
try
this
d
pretty
good
worth
a
try
worth
having
again
a
decent
stout
but
far
from
the
best
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
just
a
shade
or
two
away
from
being
completely
pitch
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
provides
some
solid
lacing
the
aroma
is
dark
and
roasty
with
a
good
dose
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
very
well
crafted
with
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
good
amount
of
roasted
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
bodied
with
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
of
this
stout
is
off
the
charts
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
throw
down
a
few
more
of
these
in
one
sitting
overall
obsidian
stout
is
a
pretty
damn
tasty
stout
that
is
highly
recommended
d
good
brew
easy
to
drink
and
a
decent
abv
that
allows
you
to
have
several
without
going
too
out
of
control
lighter
aspect
is
welcome
for
a
good
stout
to
have
on
a
hot
day
like
today
not
as
well
balanced
as
the
cadillac
mountain
stout
but
still
delicious
drinkability
not
one
to
hoard
but
i
like
it
d
good
flavor
but
could
use
a
powerboost
this
is
almost
a
session
stout
the
right
flavors
with
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
and
fairly
drinkable
granted
its
a
little
high
in
alcohol
for
that
but
hopefully
that
gives
you
a
good
idea
of
how
the
beer
tastes
obsidian
stouts
a
very
impressive
beer
in
my
opinion
itd
be
a
little
better
if
the
roasted
malts
were
toned
down
and
the
body
were
thickened
a
bit
but
its
packed
with
flavor
and
really
is
an
enjoyable
beer
its
been
a
treat
thanks
again
adam
taste
is
strongly
roasted
but
also
has
some
woody
burnt
aspect
all
malt
taste
with
some
coffeeness
assertive
carbonation
smoothness
is
a
bit
rough
but
decent
decent
stout
very
drinkable
looking
forward
to
the
abyss
nitro
tap
at
papago
in
scottsdale
az
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
with
an
inch
of
tan
head
leaving
a
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
mildly
of
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
nuts
and
tastes
a
it
smells
except
for
the
fact
that
the
flavors
are
mild
compared
to
what
i
taste
out
of
the
bottle
the
bartender
told
me
it
might
have
been
put
on
the
nitrotap
by
mistake
but
he
wasnt
sure
at
any
rate
its
got
a
silky
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
but
the
flavors
are
a
notch
less
than
im
used
to
from
this
beer
overall
a
really
nice
sessionable
stout
clean
with
strong
flavors
wellrounded
everything
a
stout
should
be
d
great
big
beer
taste
without
the
drunken
lawn
mover
ride
to
the
store
to
get
more
seriously
great
beer
on
nitro
tap
this
would
be
sublime
overall
not
too
bad
of
a
brew
d
pleased
to
be
traveling
through
deschutes
distributionland
would
be
drinking
this
a
lot
if
it
were
available
at
home
d
as
i
said
before
the
drinkability
is
not
affected
by
the
heaviness
and
it
goes
down
really
well
the
taste
and
smell
leaves
you
wanting
more
which
can
be
very
dangerous
at
the
bar
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
looking
forward
to
our
next
meeting
d
good
but
the
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
also
the
alcohol
presence
is
slightly
alarming
in
a
6
4
beer
delicate
aroma
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
opening
to
a
smooth
taste
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
it
is
very
nice
well
balanced
but
lacks
some
edge
im
sure
this
will
go
excellently
with
the
fudge
walnut
brownie
that
i
have
sitting
beside
it
a
very
nice
beer
from
deschutes
that
im
happy
to
have
tried
a
malty
toasty
stout
this
one
poured
black
as
midnight
in
the
glass
with
a
twofinger
chocolate
head
the
aroma
wasnt
quite
there
much
more
subtle
than
i
was
expecting
this
is
also
more
of
a
dry
stout
tasting
of
dark
roasted
coffee
more
than
anything
else
perfect
hop
balance
and
finishes
pretty
quick
this
one
lacks
some
of
the
hints
of
fruit
i
generally
prefer
in
stouts
but
not
going
to
hold
that
against
deschutes
this
is
a
nice
beer
the
taste
leaves
little
to
the
imagination
though
like
the
nose
it
gives
the
impression
of
an
impy
stout
a
big
beefy
flavor
but
without
the
massive
body
abv
etc
as
if
it
were
a
super
drinkable
tongue
lasher
there
is
plenty
of
roasted
toasted
deliciously
whoppin
malts
a
very
nice
bitter
hop
counterpoint
and
some
fruit
a
bit
of
full
roast
coffee
very
very
nice
the
mouth
is
full
but
not
overwhelming
nice
and
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
its
just
a
fantastic
stout
kind
of
the
little
brother
of
their
abyss
but
no
underachiever
itself
d
overall
a
good
stout
but
not
one
that
really
left
me
wanting
another
one
have
to
say
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
one
and
just
thought
it
would
have
been
a
bit
better
plus
something
in
the
aftertaste
makes
me
not
really
want
to
have
another
one
either
and
i
think
it
maybe
that
the
hops
seems
to
linger
and
leave
a
bit
of
an
odd
feeling
in
the
mouth
the
taste
was
rich
complex
and
satisfying
it
left
a
nice
bitterness
in
finish
it
was
a
sweet
malty
in
the
front
you
gotta
love
the
work
they
are
doing
in
bend
and
this
is
another
example
pours
a
deep
dark
chocolate
with
nice
initial
head
and
great
lacing
smell
is
a
ricjh
blend
of
coffee
burnt
malt
and
hops
taste
follows
a
similar
pattern
with
the
balance
of
malt
and
hops
doing
quite
well
mouthfeel
is
extremely
smooth
rich
and
chewy
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
smooth
yet
with
a
light
dry
finish
one
of
my
favorite
local
brews
many
thanks
to
dnichols
for
this
fine
brew
poured
from
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
beautiful
dark
black
with
touches
of
light
around
the
edges
huge
tan
foamy
head
that
left
tons
of
lacing
wonderful
roasted
coffee
and
slight
smoke
smell
i
have
to
take
a
while
to
enjoy
the
look
of
this
beer
before
drinking
taste
if
full
and
tremendous
hints
of
chocolate
andor
coffee
i
really
cant
tell
as
they
blend
together
and
make
for
a
really
satisfying
full
flavored
stout
this
is
not
thin
or
crisp
it
does
a
slight
bitter
finish
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
i
feel
this
may
be
the
perfect
beer
to
drink
by
the
fire
on
a
cold
night
very
robust
drinks
bigger
than
you
would
think
after
being
on
a
imperial
stout
kick
i
figured
a
stout
at
6
4
would
be
a
session
beer
not
quite
the
case
alcohol
gets
warming
and
more
noticeable
midway
through
high
roasted
character
and
astringency
takes
a
notch
or
two
away
from
the
drinkability
nice
solid
stout
streams
out
of
the
bottle
an
even
pitch
blackness
settling
into
my
maudite
glass
builds
a
two
finger
deep
chocolate
brown
head
that
hosts
fuzzy
bubbles
that
leave
lace
as
they
disapate
nose
consists
of
smokey
malt
and
soured
toffee
sense
maybe
even
some
dark
fruit
sweetness
dark
alchol
soaked
cherries
wraped
in
coco
grace
the
tongue
on
first
sip
a
clean
biscuit
like
richness
fills
the
mouth
joined
by
dark
malt
and
slight
spiceyness
an
slmost
phenol
like
sweetness
develops
on
the
back
of
the
tonguw
as
this
one
warms
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
a
soft
mix
of
richness
and
dark
bitter
this
stout
is
not
to
big
to
really
enjoy
drinking
drinkability
nothing
objectionable
here
good
solid
american
stout
i
never
thought
that
id
say
this
but
this
beer
could
use
just
a
touch
more
carbonation
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
definitely
buy
again
deschutes
brewery
has
several
good
beers
and
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
try
their
black
butte
porter
as
well
another
highly
anticipated
brew
from
geoff
aka
surlyduff
thanks
man
appearance
this
one
absolutely
absorbs
all
light
it
fades
to
black
as
soon
as
the
stream
of
carbonation
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
to
form
a
huge
moccha
tan
textured
head
like
whipped
cream
it
rises
a
good
inch
above
the
rim
of
my
glass
awesome
appearance
as
the
head
dwindles
even
fine
lacing
is
left
evenly
behind
in
an
annular
ring
like
pattern
aroma
is
full
of
dark
creamy
yet
mildly
acidic
coffee
roasts
dark
chocolate
strong
herbal
hop
leaf
approach
as
well
awesome
creamy
robust
roasted
malt
layers
with
a
fine
herbal
hop
aroma
flavors
blend
poetically
a
beautiful
clash
of
cream
caramel
and
mild
toffee
liqueur
with
brash
dark
roasted
malts
bringing
burnt
toast
chocolate
and
robust
espresso
to
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
doesnt
way
you
down
at
all
drinks
like
a
light
beer
easy
moderate
carbonation
yet
a
bitter
dry
roasty
finish
makes
it
all
so
good
velvety
smooth
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
amazing
the
most
flavorful
session
beer
ive
come
across
this
one
brings
out
imperial
stout
like
flavors
with
out
crushing
your
skull
beautiful
beer

plan
to
get
some
more
whether
friends
or

solutions
com
thanks
matt
maples
d
great
tasty
stout
with
great
hop
bite
finish
only
thing
i
could
ask
for
is
to
be
a
little
thicker
on
the
mouth
feel
black
oily
pour
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
rich
roasty
and
chocolate
smell
mostly
with
a
touch
of
hops
as
one
rater
noted
it
was
nice
and
roasty
without
any
burnt
smells
or
tastes
taste
was
beautiful
on
first
sip
creamy
chocolately
perfectly
bittersweet
roasty
goodness
with
a
nice
amount
of
hop
bitterness
perfectly
light
to
medium
carbonation
and
an
solid
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
and
flavor
goes
down
easily
and
smooth
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
definitely
a
great
stout
and
worth
going
out
of
the
way
for
i
expected
more
from
this
beer
because
of
the
reviews
and
all
of
the
talk
but
it
really
didnt
do
much
for
me
i
honestly
expected
a
lot
more
but
it
really
didnt
do
much
for
me
i
really
like
this
beer
on
sale
at
5
99
a
sixpack
it
is
really
a
bargain
in
this
age
of
6
to
15
bombers
very
drinkable
im
on
my
3rd
of
the
evening
very
well
balanced
without
any
one
flavor
dominating
the
taste
one
of
my
regulars
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
the
milkiness
of
it
is
awesome
i
could
easily
make
a
session
out
of
this
drinkablity
a
solid
stout
very
enjoyable

luscious
coffeecolored
threefingered
head
with
excellent
retention
that
left
behind
concentric
bands
of
thick
sticky
lacing
during
the
tasting
scent
out
of
the
bottle
was
coffee
and
malt
in
glass
was
much
more
diffuse
taste
similar
to
nose
with
roasted
coffee
flavors
much
more
pronounced
slightly
burntastringent
aftertaste
lingers
at
the
finish
mildly
effervescent
and
fullbodied
mouthfeel
not
as
chewy
as
an
ris
but
you
definitely
know
its
there
very
drinkable
and
would
be
a
regular
if
it
was
locally
available
i
find
this
is
a
very
versatile
stout
that
goes
well
with
food
or
holds
its
own
alone
here
in
oregon
it
is
ridiculously
affordable
and
easy
to
find
all
that
together
makes
this
one
of
the
most
drinkable
brews
around
keep
it
up
deschutes
this
is
a
wondeful
stout
the
moderate
abv
makes
this
very
drinkable
but
the
quality
is
very
high
and
very
clean
if
you
like
stouts
youre
going
to
want
another
d
highly
drinkable
very
good
stout
more
hop
bitterness
than
most
tons
of
malt
good
stuff
d
while
not
a
session
beer
its
fantastic
for
a
one
or
two
a
nighter
all
in
all
a
very
good
try
a
nice
beer
i
have
been
hitting
the
stouts
pretty
hard
lately
and
this
was
no
slouch
this
is
one
hell
of
a
stout
ive
been
impressed
with
every
deschutes
offering
ive
had
and
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
them
more
easily
awesome
brew
that
id
stock
my
fridge
with
if
i
could
within
months
of
the
best
by
date
the
blue
packaging
currently
depicted
is
out
of
date
an
opaque
darkness
in
the
glass
but
you
can
see
through
the
pour
i
nice
fluffy
tan
head
that
fades
to
sticky
lacing
patterns
the
smell
is
similar
to
the
last
bunch
of
stouts
that
ive
sampled
in
that
the
aroma
through
the
head
is
different
than
the
surface
smell
an
agitated
whiff
reveals
a
creamy
alcohol
like
a
barrel
aged
treated
product
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
that
is
altogether
creamy
closer
to
the
surface
exposes
a
roasted
malt
and
coffee
notes
lightly
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
but
the
rich
full
flavors
take
you
to
a
heavier
place
the
flavor
is
special
a
creamy
milky
semisweet
lightly
roasted
malt
with
subtle
chocolate
and
a
perfect
little
grainy
coffee
and
alcohol
flavor
that
lingers
really
nicely
this
is
an
easy
drinker
im
surprised
how
much
of
the
6
4
abv
that
you
sense
in
the
nose
and
taste
but
its
all
a
pleasure
highly
recommended
shout
out
to
drumrboy22
for
the
opportunity
the
body
is
good
with
more
of
a
mid
than
full
feel
even
with
the
astringent
bite
there
is
a
sweetness
that
stays
even
after
tasting
a
nice
stout
found
in
liquor
store
but
not
sure
if
naturally
occurring
or
not
md
full
bodied
and
wow
what
a
smooth
full
body
carbonation
does
nothing
but
lend
to
a
smooth
creamy
velvety
body
drinkability
is
top
notch
its
just
so
damn
smooth
and
easy
drinking
by
far
the
best
of
the
style
ive
ever
tasted
i
can
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
definitely
sessionable
for
a
6
beer
drinkability
this
beer
is
smooth
and
tasty
unlike
some
other
thick
and
sweet
beers
it
is
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
which
is
usually
good
md
carbonation
is
great
body
is
rich
enough
to
support
the
big
flavors
easy
to
have
several
in
a
sitting
big
flavor
of
strong
coffee
and
unsweetened
chocolate
a
good
roasted
malt
and
a
sightly
bitter
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
and
body
are
both
fine
this
is
a
fine
stout
deschutes
brewery
are
to
be
commended
for
taking
on
such
a
challenge

this
stuff
is
good
1
of
the
best
stouts
i
can
recall
a
fantastic
stout
that
fits
my
preferences
nicely
it
really
tastes
like
dessert
with
its
cookie
sweetness
thankfully
its
not
overly
sweet
and
theres
just
enough
bitterness
and
malt
heft
to
round
it
all
out
i
used
to
think
i
preferred
especially
roasted
tasting
stouts
but
this
has
shown
me
i
can
really
enjoy
maltier
ones
too
its
a
nicely
done
stout
and
one
i
wish
was
readily
available
two
finger
mocha
head
aroma
of
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
well
balanced
smooth

very
nice
mouthfeel
if
this
was
local
to
me
i
could
see
making
it
a
go

could
see
this
being
a
regular
for
me
if
i
could
get
it
all
the
time
all
in
all
a
great
brew

noted
on
the
finish
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
drinks
good
no
doubt
this
is
my
favorite
locally
available
american
stout
and
it
is
exactly
what
i
expect
out
of
deschutes
and
other
pnw
breweries
bigger
is
sometimes
better
pours
such
a
black
as
night
color
with
plenty
of
bubbling
two
inch
tall

the
once
bubbly
head

leaves
plenty
of

side

doughy

dried
fruit
with
chocolate
notes
smell
is
not
quite
black
licorice
but
more
of
a
slight
anise
smell
this
one
started
out
strong
but
there
was
not
a
lot
of
flavor
here
some
chocolate
coffee
but
it
is
all
muted
mouthfeeling
is
way
too
carbonated
and
makes
this
one
not
very
drinkable
i
had
such
high
hopes
for
this
beer
coming
from
the
makers
of
the
abyss
i
agree
with
the
akbelgianbeast
extremely
overrated
it
starts
off
with
hints
of
epoxy
maybe
some
asphalt
the
middle
and
finish
have
the
taste
and
texture
of
some
lowend
cheap
hairspray
and
that
nasty
array
of
not
so
nice
flavors
lingers
for
far
too
long
this
brew
is
definitely
the
shame
of
the
deschutes
lineup
bahh
i
cannot
beleive
this
ranks
in
the
90s
an
irishmen
would
ponder
suicide
if
he
drank
this
beer
it
pours
black
and
promising
the
nose
is
standard
for
an
american
stout
the
first
sip
has
notes
of
black
tar
followed
by
a
sweet
sort
of
hairspray
middle
rounding
out
in
a
monarch
vodka
flavor
to
me
this
beer
is
extremely
overrated
if
its
your
thing
then
more
power
to
you
but
if
you
like
true
irish
dry
stout
or
american
oatmeal
stout
then
this
beer
is
not
for
you
give
this
beer
to
someone
you
hate
for
christmas
or
be
nicer
and
give
them
some
natty
ice
roasted
dark
malt
and
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
mixed
with
dark
bittersweet
chocolate
on
the
tongue
creamy
and
smooth
very
drinkable
reminds
me
of
an
oatmeal
stout
in
terms
of
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
not
overly
thick
but
it
does
stand
up
the
20
degrees
outside
that
were
sitting
through
finishes
dry
and
nicely
bitter
the
hops
definitely
comes
out
more
at
the
end
of
the
beer
nicely
done
d
extremely
drinkable
holy
hell
this
could
be
my
goto
stout
if
they
sold
it
in
boston
its
an
excellent
brew
heard
so
much
about
this
i
finally
had
to
try
poured
into
chalice
nice
and
dark
all
but
black
with
nice
two
finger
light
brown
head
good
lacing
smell
is
of
toasted
grains
with
a
slightly
burnt
touch
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
very
nice
blend
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
toasted
grain
some
dark
malts
very
complex
yet
suprisingly
smooth
one
thing
i
did
like
is
that
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
heavy
some
stouts
its
like
drinking
motor
oil
this
was
a
little
lighter
and
easier
to
drink
while
it
doesnt
stand
out
as
an
amazing
beer
it
is
a
very
good
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
little
thin
for
me
easy
to
drink
a
very
solid
stout
i
used
to
drink
this
all
of
the
time
out
of
the
bottle
and
i
thought
it
was
prety
decent
much
better
on
nitrotap
and
normally
i
prefer
regular
taps
over
nitro
but
this
beer
really
benefits
from
the
extra
creaminess
imparted
pours
black
with
a
huge
creamy
head
and
phenomenal
lacing
the
smell
has
a
verylight
aroma
of
cream
and
some
relatively
light
roastiness
the
flavors
of
light
roastines
huge
creaminess
lingering
licorice
bitterness
and
touch
of
malty
sweetness
are
very
well
integrated
and
balanced
delicious
super
creamy
easydrinking
mouthfeel
somewhat
light
but
easy
going
i
always
thought
this
beer
was
a
little
overrated
having
it
this
way
changed
my
mind
thanks
younger35
for
another
fine
deschutes
brew
overall
probably
the
best
made
standard
american
stout
on
the
market
insane
drinkability
for
the
style
always
a
pleasure
to
have
highly
recommended
d
could
do
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
i
am
classifying
this
as
a
great
nightcap
drink
to
be
savored
rather
than
an
all
out
session
d
exceptional
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
and
incredibly
smooth
beer
to
go
along
with
all
the
big
and
great
stout
flavors
d
i
really
wish
deschutes
beers
were
available
in
my
area
this
was
damn
tasty
and
i
hope
to
have
another
one
day
d
a
good
stout
that
i
could
drink
all
night
i
first
encountered
deschutes
beers
in
washington
dc
in
2001
when
i
stopped
at
the
brickskellar
and
at
chevy
chase
wine
and
liquors
chevy
chase
charged
14
99
for
a
six
pack
of
deschutes
beer
unfortunately
ive
not
seen
this
beer
in
dc
since
2001
ive
had
to
depend
on
a
schoolteacher
friend
bringing
some
of
this
beer
back
from
the
western
us
when
he
vacations
there
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
highly
roasted
heavy
notes
of
coffee
and
touches
of
cocoa
flavor
is
chock
full
of
roasted
malt
goodness
along
with
lots
of
unsweetened
chocolate
type
flavor
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
some
carbonation
is
noted
on
the
finish
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
fans
of
stouts
could
easily
make
this
a
go
to
beer
out
here
its
available
everywhere
and
even
on
nitro
in
select
places
im
honestly
surprised
ive
not
reviewed
it
up
till
now
as
ive
probably
had
it
at
least
a
dozen
times
i
picked
up
a
6pack
in
vegas
as
its
not
currently
distributed
to
oh
the
beer
is
completely
opaque
black
with
a
thin
but
resilient
tan
foam
the
aroma
has
plenty
of
good
things
going
on
dark
roasted
malt
with
toasty
bread
and
a
hint
of
cacao
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
initially
a
little
bitter
or
burnt
flavor
at
the
backend
the
roasted
malts
come
through
big
time
all
in
all
a
very
good
stout
one
i
could
easily
recommend
to
anyone
i
bought
this
at
liquor
mart
in
boulder
co
during
a
visit
to
attend
the
gabf
d
if
every
stout
tasted
this
good
i
would
become
a
real
fan
i
love
coffee
and
semisweet
chocolate
and
this
brew
has
those
flavors
in
spades
it
may
be
a
bit
to
rich
and
filling
for
long
sessions
but
i
would
like
to
try
overall
another
great
beer
from
dechutes
i
havent
had
a
beer
of
theirs
i
disliked
yet
i
well
made
beer
that
im
lucky
to
have
tried
as
its
not
available
in
my
area
ill
be
looking
for
this
again
on
my
trips
out
west
it
would
certainly
be
great
to
have
on
hand
on
occasion
i
believe
this
is
only
my
second
beer
from
deschutes
the
other
being
black
butte
porter
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
in
buying
either
one
of
them
again
both
very
good
examples
in
their
respective
styles
pours
pitch
black
with
an
impressive
mocha
colored
head
which
displays
excellent
retention
and
leaves
webs
of
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
mingle
with
overpowered
hops
dont
know
how
else
to
describe
it
but
theres
a
crayonlike
aroma
in
there
as
well
taste
is
lightly
sweet
at
first
and
then
turns
deeply
bitter
especially
in
the
back
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
flavor
and
hops
combine
to
create
an
overall
bitterness
that
hits
you
from
all
angles
theres
also
an
earthy
woodlike
flavor
in
there
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
abrasiveness
builds
on
the
tongue
as
you
dig
deeper
into
the
glass
this
has
been
a
longtime
standby
that
i
will
continue
to
revisit
as
long
as
the
fine
folks
at
deschutes
keep
sending
it
through
the
bottling
line
a
classic
good
body
and
carbonation
well
balanced
love
the
darker
fruit
flavors
in
this
one
versus
the
typical
coffee
or
espresso
flavors
nicely
done
easier
to
drink
than
it
should
be
this
is
a
really
nice
stout
thanks
to
elricorico
for
the
bottle
a
great
beer
which
i
hope
to
get
more
of
soon
d
a
great
american
stout
i
could
drink
this
all
day
one
of
deschutes
best
beers
better
than
their
porter
which
is
also
pretty
good
an
american
classic
had
this
again
and
it
was
not
near
as
good
as
i
remembered
it
must
have
been
because
i
drank
a
few
beers
before
i
tasted
this
one
the
first
time
considering
it
can
be
had
for
8
99
a
sixpack
all
over
the
place
really
underappreciated
likely
the
greatest
american
stout
i
have
ever
had
poured
up
absolutely
black
with
a
bit
of
a
rocky
sand
coloured
head
this
is
precisley
how
a
stout
should
look
imo
smell
was
phenomenal
this
is
the
perfect
stout
smell
to
me
anyway
coffee
beans
unsweetened
bakers
chocolate
a
bit
of
a
lactic
sourness
some
smoke
the
smell
of
dried
cereals
and
perhaps
most
importantly
it
is
bereft
of
any
hops
at
all
at
the
very
least
it
is
bereft
of
any
cascade
cenntenial
or
any
other
really
pineycitrusy
hops
anyway
this
is
a
truly
great
stout
taste
starts
out
a
bit
sweet
and
then
turns
dry
toward
the
finish
flavour
profiles
include
coffee
grounds
a
bit
of
caramel
bitter
chocolate
and
a
tiny
touch
of
smoke
mouthfeel
is
very
solid
and
heavy
this
to
me
is
exactly
what
a
good
stout
should
be
absolutely
amazing
d
this
is
damn
good
as
far
as
stouts
go
i
would
put
this
close
to
the
top
of
the
class
for
the
fan
of
stouts
this
is
a
must
do
i
have
a
bad
bottle
or
just
not
like
this
beer
it
smelled
a
bit
like
molasses
and
while
there
was
a
decent
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
overall
flavor
is
nothing
to
brag
about
roasted
coffeelike
but
not
really
coffee
flavored
grains
with
a
bit
of
cocoa
i
was
expecting
something
exciting
like
a
shakespeare
stout
but
didnt
get
any
depth
like
that
smooth
creamy
fuller
bodied
beer
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
but
it
works
very
easy
drinking
stout
more
than
one
bottle
wouldnt
be
a
problem
and
thats
rare
for
me
and
stouts
hopefully
i
can
get
more
of
this
someday
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
giant
chocolate
milk
head
that
stays
awhile
and
laces
all
over
this
looks
like
a
big
bad
stout
smells
of
roated
barley
caramel
expresso
fruits
and
some
chocolate
notes
tastes
silky
smooth
starting
out
with
some
sweet
malt
with
a
bitter
bite
and
finishes
with
cocoa
roasted
coffee
nuts
and
some
hops
feels
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
little
carbonation
feel
alcohol
is
not
detected
at
all
in
this
this
is
an
awesome
stout
that
is
perfect
for
sessioning
and
a
must
try
oregon
delight
a
very
solid
stout
pours
as
black
liquid
with
a
very
nice
tan
head
aromas
were
cool
and
clean
very
attractive
to
the
stout
lover
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
smooth
flowed
like
liquid
silk
there
is
no
unpleasantlness
whatsoever
this
is
an
incredibly
balanced
brew
semisweet
chocolate
malts
slight
mocha
flavors
and
earthy
slightly
resinous
hops
round
out
the
sweetness
which
is
minimal
and
perfectly
paired
to
the
style
one
of
the
better
american
stouts
available
as
most
tend
to
be
extreme
in
one
sense
or
another
this
one
knows
what
is
best
and
sticks
to
it
drinkability
this
is
such
a
terrific
stout
that
i
wish
i
drank
more
often
it
is
readily
available
to
me
yet
i
dont
enjoy
it
as
often
as
i
should
such
balance
and
flavors
its
in
the
same
realm
as
a
imperial
stout
with
a
touch
less
alcohol
which
really
helps
in
its
drinkability
awesome
tastes
amazing
roasted
goodness
black
coffee
with
a
slight
char
very
dark
chocolate
a
little
nut
exceptional
mouthfeel
big
body
nice
carbonation
dry
cocoa
finish
and
for
a
6
abv
this
is
very
sessionable
for
those
who
dont
mind
bitterness
another
feather
in
the
cap
of
deschutes
and
in
my
opinion
one
of
americas
greatest
stouts
one
of
the
great
northwestern
stouts
it
is
entirely
black
with
a
silky
smooth
body
and
a
lush
fragrance
of
coffee
and
roasted
grains
the
taste
is
bold
and
reliable
and
finishes
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
ive
never
had
a
bad
bottle
and
its
even
better
on
tap
it
pours
out
with
a
thick
beige
head
and
leaves
lots
of
lace
on
the
glass
every
sip
delivers
big
flavor
i
wish
every
stout
was
this
good
its
deep
black
and
has
a
light
tan
head
that
leaves
a
alot
of
lace
the
aromas
are
a
blend
of
chocolate
coffee
roast
and
some
deep
grain
there
are
no
hop
aromas
to
be
found
which
is
good
and
very
easy
to
take
the
taste
is
a
perfect
balance
of
the
aforementioned
aromas
but
it
blends
into
a
sweeter
flavor
the
chocolate
dominates
the
other
two
but
it
is
balanced
with
the
roasty
bitterness
there
is
a
real
sweet
finish
almost
a
caramel
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
doesnt
dry
out
too
bad
in
the
end
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
stouts
ive
ever
had
remined
me
almost
of
a
dark
lager
like
the
3
dechutes
beers
ive
have
all
were
very
drinkableevery
day
drinkable
would
always
keep
some
in
the
fridge
if
avalible
locally
not
extreme
beers
very
solid
and
all
well
done
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
forming
a
12
dark
brown
head
over
the
opaque
dark
brownblack
brew
head
is
down
to
a
layer
of
film
pretty
quick
with
ample
sticky
dark
lace
aroma
is
dark
malts
with
touches
of
hops
taste
meets
the
noses
indications
and
more
starts
with
dark
grains
some
bitterish
coffee
notes
and
then
closes
pleasantly
bitter
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
very
goodm
and
i
am
glad
i
finally
was
able
to
check
this
one
out
pours
a
complete
black
letting
no
light
shine
through
full
two
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
quickly
dies
down
stickiness
is
insanely
good
all
over
the
glass
smell
is
a
bit
dull
not
really
what
i
expected
mild
barley
and
malt
with
a
tiny
bit
of
alcohol
some
toasted
nut
seems
to
tingle
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
a
pretty
bold
flavor
of
dark
coffee
and
some
roasted
caramel
malt
as
well
theres
a
nice
hop
bite
on
the
tongue
that
balances
this
one
out
quite
well
very
strong
enjoyable
aftertaste
of
espresso
with
a
hint
of
caramel
mouthfeel
is
very
full
bodied
with
a
surprisingly
good
amount
of
carbonation
for
this
style
deschutes
does
an
amazing
job
with
this
complex
brew
represents
this
style
very
well
pick
it
up
if
you
get
the
chance
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
at
6
4
abv
maybe
a
bit
too
drinkable
if
you
know
what
i
mean
d
it
is
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
go
crazy
over
it
but
it
is
a
easy
drinking
stout
i
am
so
happy
deschutes
has
made
the
choice
to
distribute
to
pa
not
only
is
it
great
to
have
beer
that
brought
me
to
the
craft
movement
but
it
is
still
is
of
the
same
quality
as
when
i
first
enjoyed
it
almott
two
decades
ago
overall
this
beer
seemed
to
be
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
while
many
may
be
attracted
to
its
deep
roasted
flavors
i
found
the
bitterness
to
be
too
much
to
handle
it
pours
thick
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
beautiful
contrast
of
black
and
tan
theres
plenty
of
roasted
barely
in
this
beer
one
thats
very
bitter
from
the
burnt
flavors
pretty
drinkable
i
had
this
after
eating
some
greasy
pizza
and
my
palate
welcomed
the
rush
of
roasted
bitterness
d
excellent
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
a
great
straightforward
stout
though
i
slightly
prefer
black
butte
porter
hmmdamn
itim
a
convert
forget
what
i
said
about
this
brews
mediocrity
as
it
warms
it
just
gets
better
and
better
forget
about
it
this
is
great
stuffand
oh
so
drinkable
very
well
done
and
deserving
of
praise
now
im
off
to
see
a
head
shrink
about
my
manic
beer
reviewing
tendencies
9107
got
another
bottle
from
younger35
and
its
just
as
tasty
as
the
first
d
the
bitterness
is
not
distinctly
hops
and
not
roasted
malt
but
a
blend
of
the
two
which
is
interesting
nice
rich
malt
flavors
make
this
a
full
flavored
stout
mouthfeel
is
as
smooth
as
can
be
with
roasted
nuts

thin

a
wonderfully
full
flavor
to
it

a
little
too
carbonated
for
my
liking

still
damn
good
definitely
very
drinkable

love
to
get
more

russ
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts

of
the

dry

thin
swirling
head
with
little
retention
on
the
ring
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
smell
was
a
little
weak
for
me
perhaps
i
had
a
bit
of
an
oncoming
cold
but
nothing
spectacular
here
taste
is
most
excellent
dark
malts
coffee
chocolate
everything
you
would
expect
from
a
stout
of
this
caliber
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
dry
very
easy
going
down
if
it
werent
for
the
6something
abv
on
this
i
could
drink
this
all
day
very
drinkable
stout
and
one
of
my
favorites
i
think
deschutes
gets
a
bad
rap
around
here
because
the
mirror
pond
and
black
butte
are
the
only
widely
availabe
selections
from
them
and
they
are
a
bit
weak
in
all
categories
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer

also
standard
stout
to
me
roasty
no
hops

was
a
nice
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
should
be
in
the
top

is
easy
to
drink

strong

good
well
balanced
this
is
a
damn
tasty
stout
that
id
love
to
have
available
locally
d
for
a
stout
its
crazy
drinkable
somehow
i
dont
find
stouts
filling
but
its
also
compliments
to
deschutes
for
making
a
great
drinkable
beer
if
i
had
this
on
tap
at
a
bar
i
would
have
ordered
a
second
round
right
from
the
first
sip
the
flavors
never
leave
and
never
tone
down
such
an
awesome
beer
on
every
level
when
you
find
this
beer
dont
mix
it
in
a
sixpack
buy
a
whole
sixpack
of
it
biggie
goes
well
with
a
stout
man
i
just
wrote
a
short
story
opinion
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
and
i
would
consider
it
to
be
one
of
the
best
american
stouts
that
i
have
had
to
date
i
like
that
there
is
some
real
depth
to
the
malt
so
that
you
dont
have
a
watery
beer
with
hops
and
roast
and
that
is
it
this
beer
is
balanced
with
all
of
the
components
independently
noticeable
d
overall
this
was
awesome
the
perfect
desset
beer
as
a
good
stout
should
always
be
i
found
no
hint
at
all
of
any
alcohol
nothing
but
great
aromas
and
flavors
very
robust
full
of
complex
suprises
in
flavor
and
taste
an
all
around
great
brew
definatly
lived
up
to
its
reputation
from
babydoc
for
my
bombing
served

a
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice

inch

nice
lacing
and
froth

smell
is
roasted
malts
and
cocoa
bean
taste
is
of
bittering
coffee
bean
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
medium
in
feel
a
decent
stout
from
an
above
average
brewery

i
would

quickly

leaves
a
nice
bit
of

mainly
of

a
dark
cocoa

an
incredibely
drinkable
and
satisfying
stout
without
the
insane
alcohol
content

for
a
smaller
stout

the
difficulty

to
the
local
liquor
store

expect
shipment
in
2008

will
be
a
great
day
very
good
stout

on
the
level
of
cadillac
mtn

excellent
nonetheless

harsh

it
makes
it
easier

delicious
looks

a

this
one
is
so
black
though
i
like
a
nice
malty
blackness
and
this
one
serves
me
right
overall
this
beer
surprised
me
i
was
not
looking
for
such
a
complicated
and
masterful
brew
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
in
a
while
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
very
dark
brown
opaque
with
two
fingers
of
deep
tan

which
leaves
a
nice
lacing
from
start
to
finish
smells
of
dark
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
and
dried

taste
is
of
roasted
nuts
hops
unsweetened
cocoa
dark

medium

and
complex
very
nice
ill
have
another
this
is
about
as
good
as
a
stout
can
be
without
being
taken
to
the
imperial
level
drinkability
overall
definitey
deserving
of
its
high
rating
and
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
style
ive
ever
tried
the
abv
sneaks
up
on
you
a
bit
as
i
found
myself
going
through
a
sixpack
fairly
quickly
before
slowing
myself
down

the

a

then
a

scent
emerges
as
it

interesting
smell
for
a
nonimperialized
stout
the
first
sip
of
this
stout
screams
perfection
without
a
doubt
chewy
surprisingly
viscous
body
with
an
amazing
nearlyburnt
roasted
quality
to
the
grain
flavors
that
never
becomes
too
bitter
because
of
a
lucious
black
cherry
nectar
and
toffeechocolate
truffle
taste
that
emerges
at
the
finish
which
ends
in
a
powerfully
bittersweet
medicinal
flourish
much
heavier
on
the
palate
than
most
representatives
of
the
style
id
usually
find
this
distracting
but
with
the
utterly
fascinating
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
i
cant
help
but
consider
the
heavierthanusual
weight
to
be
a
simple
reassertion
of
the
overall
force
of
this
masterful
stout
i
want
more
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
loaded
with
roasted
flavors
the
beer
has
a
low
carbonated
medium
body
this
is
a
dam
fine
beer
and
i
would
definately
have
it
again
merry
christmas
to
me
a
great
brew
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
very
filling
for
a
stout
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
can
be
both
a
good
sipper
and
a
good
pounder
bitter
coffee
a
hint
of
chocolate
a
splash
of
citrus
trying
to
make
itself
heard
more
chocolate
like
a
milkshake
and
so
damned
creamy
and
smooth
as
i
said
marvelous
thanks
to
flexabull
for
this
a
rich
and
creamy
brew
the
charcoal
toast
intermixed
well
with
the
previous
mentioned
aspects
body
was
dry
and
gritty
just
an
allround
good
quaffing
brew
d
a
session
stout
at
its
finest
even
with
the
slightly
higher
abv
smooth
and
silky
this
brew
has
what
it
takes
the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
will
drink
what
i
have
sparingly
and
seek
out
more
a
huge
double
thanks
to
fartingdog
for
a
great
trade
prosit
mk
very
drinkable
treat
easily
great
session
fare
on
a
fall
or
winters
eve
even
light
bodied
enough
for
year
round
enjoyment
would
also
be
a
great
stout
to
introduce
rookie
stout
drinkers
to
would
gladly
drink
again
but
unfortunately
not
available
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
session
worthy
stout
ive
had
this
on
nitro
before
and
that
is
a
real
treat
mouthfeel
is
good
little
thin
good
body
but
less
than
optimal
drinkability
is
very
good
so
smooooth
its
not
only
an
excellent
example
of
american
stout
but
just
a
damn
tasty
beer
im
going
to
start
calling
my
liver
the
place
deschutes
beers
go
to
die
this
is
a
fine
stout
and
quite
easy
to
consume
if
i
could
i
would
make
this
a
staple
beer
in
my
fridge
d
just
a
terrific
stout
im
fortunate
to
live
in
oregon
where
i
can
get
this
one
anytime
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
this
id
forgotten
how
delicious
obsidian
is
highly
reccommended
great
winter
beer
good
with
stew
or
steak
palate
started
out
kind
of
thin
but
it
was
too
cold
got
better
as
it
warmed
awesome
a
great
stout
from
deschutes
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
will
probably
buy
it
more
often
12
ounce
bottle
i
thought
this
rather
tasty
and
a
great
representation
of
the
style
the
taste
is
good
its
smooth
as
glass
thanks
to
the
caskconditioning
just
like
obsidian
this
stout
is
one
slick
black
treat
hands
down
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
stout
ive
had
this
is
up
there
with
the
imperial
stouts
in
my
mind
after
a
agonizingly
slow
pour
with
the
last
drizzles
of
the
12oz
bottle
oozing
out
like
oil
it
left
a
jet
black
color
with
a
dense
2
5
finger
tan
head
beautiful
aroma
is
very
complex
with
blends
of
sweetness
alcohol
notes
roasted
maltiness
coffee
chocolate
a
very
pleasing
mixture
the
taste
is
just
as
complex
as
the
aroma
but
bordering
on
perfection
first
impression
is
a
biting
tingling
on
the
tongue
with
a
slight
bitterness
that
fades
into
a
robust
earthy
toasted
malt
with
splashes
of
coffee
chocolate
and
a
finishing
mild
bitterness
and
afterall
that
you
have
an
aftertaste
of
roasted
nuttiness
as
it
warms
it
gets
even
more
complex
excellent
mouthfeel
is
good
creamy
and
complete
i
successfully
sessioned
this
at
a
bbq
recently
and
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
stouts
that
this
is
about
as
easy
drinking
as
it
gets
from
a
12oz
bottle
a
deep
opaque
black
with
a
bubbly
thin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
of
roasted
and
black
malts
and
maybe
cascade
hops
somewhat
mustysour
taste
is
of
heavy
rostiness
and
coffee
not
too
viscous
but
has
nice
body
carbonation
is
about
medium
the
flavor
definitely
carries
this
one
with
strong
coffee
character
along
with
a
fairly
mild
bitterness
d
very
drinkable
an
very
tasty
stout
from
deschutes
highly
recommended
on
nitro
nice
buubbly
nitro
head
that
slowly
joins
the
black
goodness
below
very
gentle
smell
that
does
not
beat
you
over
the
head
with
over
strong
scents
but
ones
that
entice
you
to
find
what
lurks
witthin
the
glass
before
you
the
nitro
gives
a
smoothness
that
unveeils
the
flavors
before
you
with
chocolate
burnt
caramel
and
a
softly
balanced
bitterness
in
its
aftertaste
having
this
on
nitro
is
a
real
treat
for
any
stout
lover
it
takes
an
amazing
stout
and
just
brings
it
up
to
that
holy
jeez
i
cant
even
believe
how
good
this
is
level
great
in
the
bottle
unbelievable
on
nitro
building
on
this
theme
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
viscous
yet
quaffable
awesome
drinkability
two
bottles
or
pints
are
almost
a
given
with
this
beer
my
favorite
everday
stout
and
quite
a
bargain
at
just
over
a
buck
a
bottle
superb
drinkability
low
alcohol
and
lots
of
flavor
mouthfeel
isnt
over
the
top
so
this
one
goes
down
a
bit
too
easily
definately
one
of
the
best
standard
stouts
ive
had
to
date
a
must
try
to
see
how
a
stout
should
be
made
pitch
black
in
color
with
an
amazingly
frothy
mocha
colored
head
about
34
of
an
inch
in
height
decent
retention
leaving
a
good
amount
of
delicate
lacing
mostly
smells
of
dark
chocolate
espresso
hints
of
dark
fruits
and
some
sort
of
musty
smell
tastes
pretty
much
the
same
as
it
smells
quite
delicious
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
finishes
clean
very
creamy
and
smooth
and
not
too
heavy
this
is
a
pretty
awesome
beer
super
easy
too
drink
and
very
refreshing
a
great
example
of
an
american
stout
i
hope
i
can
trade
for
more
of
this
seek
this
one
out
roasted
and
chocolaty
malts
in
the
flavor
with
a
bitter
smoky
lingering
finish
medium
body
with
a
mediumhigh
carbonation
seems
like
it
should
have
a
bit
more
weight
to
it
flavors
are
passable
but
stiffly
bitter
finish
hurts
the
drinkability
good
stuff
this
is
a
well
made
beer
and
i
can
see
why
its
rated
highly
but
i
cant
get
past
the
lactose
flavor
i
prefer
more
roastiness
from
my
stouts
i
can
see
why
this
is
near
the
top
of
its
class
d
the
burnt
malt
bitterness
may
be
a
bit
hard
to
take
sometimes
but
if
you
can
handle
it
this
is
a
lovely
beer
the
afterthoughts
are
just
as
good
as
the
aftertaste
its
all
here
flavorwise
roasted
malts
rule
the
roost
with
the
subsequent
coffee
chocolate
and
licorice
coming
through
periodically
mildly
bitter
in
a
dark
chocolate
sort
of
way
very
delicious
and
chewy
came
off
slightly
heavy
bodied
however
for
some
reason
it
went
down
way
too
fasthappy
i
was
given
two
bottles
to
enjoy
i
see
now
why
this
one
gets
rated
so
highly
good
drinkability
but
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
have
more
than
a
few
imo
this
is
one
hell
of
an
impressive
brew
bottom
line
one
of
my
favourite
american
stouts
out
there
i
highly
recommend
it
drinkability
this
is
the
example
of
a
liquid
meal
very
flavorful
and
these
can
be
quaffed
for
a
while
this
beer
should
be
had
by
everyone
drinkability
very
good
well
above
average
i
only
wish
that
this
beer
was
available
here
one
thing
for
sure
next
time
youre
at
your
favorite
venue
demand
the
obsidian
be
put
on
nitro
this
was
really
a
good
stout
poured
jet
black
with
thin
tan
head
and
okay
lacing
aroma
was
that
of
chocolate
mixed
with
dark
fruit
grapes
plums
cherries
taste
was
very
much
chocolate
malt
as
beer
warmed
alcohol
became
more
noticeable
about
midglass
but
perfectly
blended
with
the
flavor
very
good
long
smooth
finish
this
has
to
be
my
favorite
stout
to
date
just
sorry
i
cant
readily
obtain
in
ga
d
although
i
was
dissapointed
i
think
it
tastes
better
wo
the
nitro
it
still
was
a
great
beer
and
i
orderered
another
as
soon
as
i
was
finished
with
the
first
the
next
time
i
go
to
the
store
il
pick
up
a
sixpack
and
review
this
again
notes
well
it
hit
my
palate
just
right
for
the
price
wow
how
can
this
be
priced
similar
to
their
small
beer
offerings
deschutes
is
amazing
in
that
they
have
good
beers
and
at
times
in
the
excellent
to
outstanding
range
yet
they
maintain
a
low
price
by
craft
brew
standards
i
have
yet
to
see
this
beer
offered
in
chicago
but
will
not
hesitate
to
order
a
case
from
my
local
retailer
if
they
can
fulfill
a
special
order
great
drinkability
really
smooth
drinking
stout
here
that
just
gets
better
the
more
that
you
drink
it
this
beer
strikes
a
nice
balance
between
interesting
and
mild
to
drink
just
about
perfectly
my
bottle
looks
different
than
the
one
in
the
picture
but
its
definitely
deschutes
obsidian
stout
so
here
we
go
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
just
faint
hints
of
ruby
around
the
edges
thin
lightish
brown
head
smells
deeply
toasty
and
sweet
just
a
hint
of
the
charcoal
bite
mmm
incredibly
rich
chocholate
espresso
flavor
roasty
and
vinous
with
a
fizzy
bitterness
that
balances
the
slight
sweetness
perfectly
i
never
know
quite
what
to
say
about
drinkability
with
american
stouts
i
havent
met
an
american
session
stout
yet
but
id
love
to
sit
around
and
drink
this
all
night
if
it
wouldnt
fill
me
up
after
just
a
couple
d
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
still
has
a
very
nice
flavor
slàinte
drinkability
is
high
if
you
want
a
stout
this
would
surely
please
you
in
every
way
you
could
hope
for
i
get
the
feeling
someone
worked
very
hard
on
this
recipe
because
ever
aspect
of
this
beer
strives
for
greatness
and
pleases
on
nearly
every
level
another
fantastic
job
by
deschutes
thanks

cheers
drinkability
i
dont
think
that
is
a
fair
question
for
either
this
style
or
this
particular
beer
it
is
satisfying
in
itself
in
the
single
glassful
im
drinking
this
while
eating
a
brownie
and
believe
me
one
could
want
for
nothing
else
the
perfect
ending
to
a
wonderful
meal
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
as
it
settles
into
the
glass
i
understand
the
obsidian
part
of
this
one
wow
a
2cm
frothy
tan
head
w
ruby
hues
settles
nicely
atop
of
the
body
very
sticky
to
the
glass
aroma
is
mainly
of
mocha
and
cocoa
i
also
find
some
slight
fruit
rasberry
and
even
some
roasty
malt
in
there
i
get
a
rasberry
chocolate
icecream
aroma
mainly
maybe
even
some
grains
oats
very
brilliant
sipping
it
i
first
notice
the
creaminess
of
it
really
full
body
with
a
slight
tingly
carbonation
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
but
the
smooth
body
takes
over
quickly
at
first
i
can
taste
the
rasberries
along
with
a
big
roasty
malt
some
mocha
coffee
comes
through
as
well
and
the
end
is
balanced
out
nicely
by
bitterness
of
the
hops
which
are
just
slightly
grassy
or
a
bit
of
pine
long
lasting
aftertaste
of
mocha
coffee
and
hops
very
nice
the
ending
is
creamy
and
is
a
great
winter
brew
imo
i
could
drink
this
a
whole
lot
very
nice
drinkability
is
good
nice
coffee
flavors
and
nice
lingering
hop
flavors
thanks
to
bcg
bif
and
babydoc
for
this
bottle
final
thoughts
you
might
like
this
one
right
away
you
might
not
i
wasnt
sure
until
i
got
a
few
pints
in
but
as
it
turns
out
its
as
great
a
stout
as
any
a
very
roasty
stout
d
overall
obsidian
is
a
very
tasty
stout
very
drinkable
the
smell
is
dominated
by
roasted
malts
the
taste
brings
more
roasted
malt
up
front
with
a
touch
of
smoke
flavor
hops
come
through
in
the
finish
and
leave
a
long
taste
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
while
drinkability
is
great
for
the
alcohol
content
flavor
is
thick
and
mighty
medium
roast
coffee
wuickly
followed
with
some
dark
chocolate
carbonation
kind
of
sparkles
on
the
tongue
slight
hoppiney
bitterness
towards
the
end
even
reminds
me
just
a
bit
of
spearmint
candy
for
some
reason
lots
of
burnt
and
toasted
malts
in
hte
flavor
even
a
bit
dry
in
the
finish
really
nice
slow
sipping
beer
that
i
struggled
to
sip
slowly
note
the
label
has
apparently
been
redesigned
since
the
ba
picture
was
posted
it
might
be
worthy
of
an
update
i
think
i
like
the
new
packaging
better
drinkability
this
would
be
in
my
regular
rotation
if
it
were
available
a
nice
example
of
the
style
drinkable
it
is
this
beer
has
grown
on
me
greatly
the
first
half
of
my
glass
just
failed
to
wow
me
the
second
half
impresses
me
i
have
to
take
this
beer
as
a
whole
though
some
movies
start
slow
but
have
a
hell
of
a
finish
this
stout
falls
into
that
category
it
leaves
me
on
a
positive
note
but
the
first
impression
cant
escape
my
memories
either
all
in
all
this
is
clearly
a
wellbrewed
beer
i
like
it
i
purchased
a
couple
bottles
from
liquid
solutions
i
am
happy
i
finally
got
to
try
this
stalwart
of
ba
top
100
beers
worth
a
try
as
it
pours
the
head
takes
time
to
develop
it
expands
into
only
a
small
crust
on
top
the
color
of
the
foam
being
a
very
reddish
browntan
it
then
dissipates
pretty
quickly
also
the
beer
color
is
very
dark
black
not
much
light
penetrates
the
smell
is
amazingly
smoky
and
burnt
with
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
more
smokiness
reminiscent
of
a
campfire
burnt
coffee
flavors
are
present
also
before
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
shines
through
at
the
finish
for
a
stout
its
not
real
thick
the
carbonation
is
low
but
adequate
suprisingly
drinkable
beer
maybe
because
its
not
too
strong
or
chewy
like
some
in
its
class
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tall
tan
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
just
how
a
stout
should
look
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
lots
of
chocolate
notes
with
small
hints
of
roasted
malts
and
plenty
of
malty
goodness
promising
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
aroma
lots
of
chocolate
malty
flavors
along
with
some
roasted
notes
this
beer
is
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
very
very
tasty
beer
nothing
is
offensive
and
everything
blends
well
this
is
an
extremely
well
balanced
stout
it
looks
good
too
pours
almost
back
with
a
medium
brown
head
that
lasted
to
the
end
leaving
a
touch
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
pint
glass
on
the
way
down
smell
is
mostly
of
dark
chocolate
but
is
rather
delicate
almost
too
slight
but
still
very
nice
the
taste
starts
with
strong
coca
notes
but
seamlessly
transitions
through
toasty
malts
to
an
excellent
dry
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
round
smooth
and
chewy
the
carbonation
level
is
just
right
this
stout
is
very
complex
but
not
at
all
difficult
to
drink
none
of
the
flavors
are
overpowering
and
with
a
very
velvety
mouthfeel
the
first
pint
begs
a
second
pours
a
deep
brown
to
black
color
with
a
sparse
coating
of
light
tan
head
over
top
nose
is
nice
and
chocolatey
sweet
with
a
background
of
ashy
roasted
malt
good
balance
between
sweetness
and
roast
in
this
one
flavor
is
nice
as
well
mostly
chocolate
in
the
start
with
the
roasty
and
light
hoppy
bitter
on
the
finish
giving
a
light
coffee
note
to
it
bitter
doesnt
hang
on
too
long
but
stays
around
just
long
enough
feel
is
velvety
smooth
and
creamy
but
nice
and
thick
with
a
minimal
carbonation
this
is
an
incredible
stout
the
beer
is
in
very
good
harmony
with
itself
flavor
and
aroma
meld
very
well
i
dont
remember
what
i
said
about
this
before
but
i
am
a
big
fan
of
what
i
just
drank
thanks
deshcutes
and
especially
to
big
love
for
sending
this
my
way
the
taste
is
sharp
with
a
burnt
acidity
to
it
up
front
this
is
balanced
by
a
soft
creamy
mouthfeel
that
starts
in
the
middle
and
carries
through
almost
to
the
end
the
finish
is
dominated
by
roasted
notes
quite
similar
to
the
finish
of
an
espresso
acidity
and
roasted
burnt
notes
for
all
of
the
roast
character
it
is
quite
smooth
it
is
lack
that
burnthusk
astringency
that
can
be
found
in
some
stouts
having
said
that
the
roasted
acidity
here
is
a
bit
too
much
there
needs
to
be
a
bit
more
something
sweet
malt
would
do
it
to
balance
it
out
perhaps
a
bit
of
age
would
do
the
trick
as
well
i
have
a
feeling
this
might
mellow
out
over
6
months
or
so
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
help
make
this
a
real
belter
of
a
brew
this
is
a
serious
stout
that
i
would
reserve
for
a
special
occasion
wow
very
very
nice
intense
and
longlasting
aroma
and
flavour
in
a
beautifully
smooth
and
aesthetically
beautiful
beer
i
recently
read
an
article
times
of
london
i
think
about
deus
and
the
new
upmarket
beer
segment
comparing
high
end
beer
to
champagne
a
wine
expert
tasting
deus
said
it
was
a
great
beer
but
still
short
leading
him
to
say
that
he
couldnt
see
paying
champagne
prices
for
beer
a
taste
that
disappears
immediately
i
can
say
without
hesitation
that
the
aforementioned
wine
expert
has
never
tried
obsidian
stout
you
should
and
it
wont
set
you
back
as
much
as
a
bottle
of
champagne
slightly
smokey
little
coffee
so
wouldnt
have
any
more
beyond
that
either
way
soy
sauce
this
is
very
drinkable
not
a
beer
to
be
pounding
all
night
with
the
huge
yet
mellow
maltiness
and
flavor
of
very
dark
chocolate
taking
over
as
it
passes
the
tip
of
the
tongue
slightly
roasty
on
the
finish

black
color
and
a
foamy
tan
head
that
left
real
nice
lace
this
stout
had
a
nice
roasted
smoky
taste
good
solid
stout
that
can
become
a
regular
in
ones
repotoire
i
enjoyed
this
with
some
lamb
sausage
higer
alcohol
content
very
disappointing
lacked
depth
almost
no
chocolate
flavor
this
thing
is
mostly
a
dud
flavor
died
off
in
second
really
disappointed
pours
a
clear
deep
brown
with
bright
ruby
highlights
producing
1
5
fingers
of
deep
tan
shortlived
frothy
head
that
leaves
a
thin
wash
of

is
dark
chocolate
coco
roasted

a
hint
of
roasted

taste
is
tootsie
roll
bittersweet
chocolate
roast
pepper
a
little
char
or
smoke

dry
with
a
kick
of

lightly
bitter
coco

roast
nuts
with
a
hint
of
char
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
creamy
but
prickly
a
little
chewy
dry
drawing
overall
this
is
a
tasty
stout
but
due
to
the
lack
of
chocolate
flavor
in
a
chocolate
stout
its
a
little
disappointing
if
this
beer
had
been
labeled
just
a
regular
stout
or
oatmeal
stout
it
would
be
a
really
good
stout
but
as
a
chocolate
stout
its
not
that
great
disappointing
it
is
very
thin
champagne
like
first
beer
that
i
had
from
fort
collins
and
i
thought
it
lacked
flavor
the
taste
was
bitter
and
it
was
over
carbonated
pours
dark
with
a
small
white
head
faint
chocolate
smell
has
chocolate
taste
but
not
that
strong
somewhat
creamy
light
but
flavorful
was
expecting
a
heavier
taste
and
feel
drinks
more
like
a
bock
than
a
stout
not
much
chocolate
to
speak
of
not
much
chocolate
flavor
here
o
pleasant
and
recommended
stout
resembles
ipa
to
much
not
a
fan
of
this
looks
good
smells
hoppy
tastes
hoppy
very
little
sweetness
and
even
less
chocolate
while
the
beer
was
not
too
bad
its
not
what
i
expect
from
this
style
i
wanted
a
desert
beer
for
turkey
day
this
doesnt
cut
it
fiancee
is
bringing
me
sam
smiths
organic
chocolate
stout
n
ill
be
happy
and
thankful
o

its
a
beer
not
one
to
hate
on
but
not
one
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
brewery
does
a
decent
chocolate
stout
though
its
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
tends
to
be
a
little
more
expensive
too
for
some
reason
but
its
worth
a
shot
if
you
find
it
meh
no
aroma
or
flavor
who
cares
what
it
looks
like
andor
feels
like
when
drunk
tastes
closer
to
a
black
ipa
than
a
chocolate
stout
itd
get
a
significantly
higher
rating
as
a
black
ipa
imo
the
fort
collins
brewery
chocolate
stout
3
55
body
is
less
than
id
expect
for
a
chocolate
stout
thin
more
like
a
brown
ale
lingering
mix
of
semisweet
and
milk
chocolate
flavored
finish
overall
this
one
started
strong
with
an
attractive
appearance
and
nose
but
fell
flat
on
taste
and
mouth
feel
lacks
the
depth
of
malt
notes
and
round
mouth
feel
that
i
was
hoping
for
ugh
so
not
that
long
ago
im
pounding
coors
light
keystone
high
life
whatever
then
all
of
the
sudden
the
people
i
drink
with
decide
we
can
do
better
and
im
drinking
stouts
porters
imperial
whatevers
double
chocolate
somethings
and
who
knows
what
now
im
all
like
this
chocolate
stout
is
too
thin
waaa
tell
you
what
if
you
like
beer
but
arent
a
total
snob
about
it
then
this
beer
will
do
you
fine
but
if
you
obsess
about
mouthfeel
and
lacing
and
who
cares
doug
lets
just
get
wasted
already
sorry
that
one
doesnt
apply
this
beer
will
disappoint
you
not
much
body
to
it
kind
of
seems
like
they
took
a
heineken
and
threw
a
couple
hersheys
kisses
in
the
wort
ok
not
a
heinie
that
was
mean
but
you
get
my
drift
expected
better
not
thoroughly
pissed
about
it
edit
its
becoming
more
watery
as
i
drink
it
time
to
drop
the
scores
some
a
decent
brew
that
could
use
a
bit
more
umph
still
pretty
good
just
a
tad
watery
i
like
the
drinkability
though
so
the
local
convenience
store
near
my
office
put
in
a
few
taps
and
started
selling
growlers
i
picked
up
this
brew
to
give
it
a
try
it
is
a
dark
opaque
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
it
smells
like
a
dry
beer
some
chocolate
but
also
lots
of
roast
nutty
and
full
the
taste
is
dry
with
some
malt
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
solid
good
easy
drinking
but
a
bit
lackluster
o
this
beer
might
seem
a
little
onedimensional
but
it
isnt
a
bad
selection
if
you
really
like
chocolate
malts
i
probably
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
the
appearance
and
flavor
werent
interesting
and
at
5
3
abv
neither
was
the
buzz
the
dryness
factors
into
the
feel
as
well
after
an
initial
smoothness
gives
way
to
it
theres
a
little
crispness
to
it
perhaps
just
a
touch
too
much
though
the
smoothness
never
really
dies
off
pours
to
a
thin
tan
head
that
leaves
very
little
lace
and
ust
hangs
around
as
a
tiny
ring
edging
the
glass
color
is
dark
brownblack
aroma
is
sweet
malt
caramel
and
coffee
not
really
chocolatey
like
many
of
these
chocolate
stouts
are
flavor
is
mild
and
semisweet
much
like
a
good
easy
drinking
brewpub
american
style
stout
mild
hop
bitterness
with
sweetness
relying
on
roasted
grains
for
balance
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
on
light
side
for
style
overall
a
stout
that
i
really
like
although
it
looks
rather
limp
and
the
smell
is
not
strong
and
chocolaty
as
i
would
prefer
overall
the
flavor
is
good
but
the
both
the
aroma
and
appearance
take
away
from
otherwisw
could
be
a
desent
beer
overall
honesty
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
beer
its
was
pretty
nondescript
rjt
fort
collins
chocolate
stout
pours
a
midnight
black
hue
with
only
a
thin
ring
of
tan
foam
sitting
on
top
the
aroma
is
fantastic
giving
of
scents
of
coffee
creamy
milk
chocolate
a
slight
smokiness
and
a
hint
of
citrus
esters
as
well
the
flavor
is
pretty
nice
with
a
fair
balance
of
the
creamy
chocolate
and
coffee
and
the
aforementioned
smoked
and
hoppy
characteristics
not
overly
complex
but
thats
perfectly
alright
very
soft
feel
and
a
thin
finish
unfortunately
overall
though
its
pretty
flavorful
for
a
low
abv
stout
nice
dark
color
smoky
smell
and
taste
nice
finish
just
the
right
beer
by
a
fire
on
a
winter
day
no
complaints
will
buy
again
which
is
one
of
my
best
compliments
i
rate
this
very
good
i
can
barely
taste
chocolate
smoke
flavor
is
just
the
right
amount
poured
into

a
thick

leaves
tons
of

and
fades
about
halfway
before

a

coffee
taste
is
smooth

semisweet
chocolate
with
a
hint
of

barely
any
bitterness
at
all
very
smooth

coffee
bitter
taste
very
bitter

chocolate
aftertaste
pretty
good
stout
not
earth
shattering
but
i
enjoyed
it
the
appearance
is
a
dark
heavy
rich
chocolate
stout
with
a
frothy
1
head
poured
smooth
into
a
glass
to
enjoy
while
the
appearance
was
very
dark
and
heavy
the
mouth
feel
was
smooth
and
light
i
could
definitely
smell
and
taste
the
chocolate
heavy
but
it
was
pretty
carbonated
for
a
chocolate
stout
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
is
trying
to
break
into
the
chocolate
stout
world
as
it
probably
would
be
a
brew
that
isnt
too
heavy
for
the
newbie
overall
a
rather
nice
stout
with
a
good
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavor
which
still
maintains
a
rather
easy
drinking
character
overall
a
nice
light
chocolate
stout
not
bad
kind
of
interesting
i
could
have
this
again
this
beer
pours
up
a
deep
black
with
ruby
highlights
a
nice
one
finger
caramel
colored
head
decent
retention
and
a
healthy
bit
of
lacing
nose
is
chocolate
roasted
nuts
and
coffee
very
nice
taset
is
sweet
up
front
with
notes
of
malt
and
cola
finish
is
chocolate
coffee
caramel
and
nuts
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
loved
this
one
the
taste
is
rather
uneventful
thin
in
taste
and
feel
and
a
touch
watery
roast
coffee
dry
powdered
chocolate
and
burnt
smoky
embers
touch
the
tongue
but
never
really
grab
you
i
feel
like
theres
more
to
be
done
here
perhaps
an
imperial
style
to
really
impress
but
this
is
somewhat
disappointing
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
little
bit
of
light
passage
short
tan
head
significant
lacing
nose
is
heavily
roasted
with
mild
waves
of
coffee
and
cocoa
taste
has
an
astringent
chocolate
bitterness
with
bits
of
sweetness
scattered
in
overall
a
dry
flavor
with
plenty
of
roast
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
highly
carbonated
this
one
happens
to
be
available
year
round
in
my
area
and
has
become
a
staple
in
my
beer
cabinet
maybe
im
a
little
biased
on
it
but
i
certainly
think
it
deserves
a
higher
rating
then
i
see
here
i
think
it
is
close
to
excellent
for
a
chocolate
stout
maybe
it
is
downrated
a
bit
since
it
has
a
relatively
low
abv
for
a
stout
and
thats
ok
just
means
i
can
drink
more
of
them
before
i
fall
down
overall
pretty
much
the
definition
of
average
for
me
not
bad
at
all
but
nothing
mind
blowing
here
grab
it
if
you
need
an
easy
stout
fix
o
a
good
stepping
stone
chocolate
stout
nothing
overwhelming
this
was
a
slightly
above
average
stout
nice
balanced
flavor
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
sorry
fort
collins
i
would
reach
for
other
beers
before
this
one
again
o
not
my
favorite
stout
but
nonetheless
a
good
stout
it
has
an
easy
drinkability
with
great
taste
o
ive
had
this
one
in
the
fridge
for
about
8
months
now
given
the
style
i
dont
think
thats
too
big
of
a
sin
but
this
is
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
to
say
the
least
there
are
many
more
beers
out
there
of
this
style
that
are
much
easier
to
get
and
much
more
well
rounded
appearance
was
the
best
part
of
this
brew
the
rest
was
downhill
cheers
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
dark
brown
with
a
miniscule
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
there
are
aromas
of
dark
roasted
barley
malts
chocolate
coffee
and
some
hops
the
taste
follows
the
nose
there
are
dark
roasted
malts
bitter
coffee
bitter
chocolate
and
bitter
hops
it
has
that
charred
malt
characteristic
in
the
flavor
the
carbonation
helps
chase
the
bitter
aftertaste
from
the
mouth
the
body
is
light
with
plentiful
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
this
has
a
nice
aroma
and
even
nicer
taste
the
hops
and
chocolate
mesh
well
and
also
balance
it
out
overall
an
ok
beer
there
isnt
a
lot
of
complexity
with
the
flavor
and
it
sits
a
little
light
im
usually
a
fan
of
stouts
but
this
one
is
a
little
disappointing
o
not
bad
but
nothing
to
go
chase
after
either
definitely
adds
another
dimension
to
the
style
though
bottle
from
the
wine
seller
in
a2
pours
dark
brown
with
a
small
light
browncream
colored
head
smells
like
chocolate
a
little
roast
but
taste
is
lacking
mouthfeel
is
too
light
and
watered
down
for
the
style
much
like
chocolate
flavored
water
not
much
else
going
on
beyond
that
to
describe
here
fort
collins
tends
to
underwhelm
as
a
whole
with
some
ok
and
some
not
and
this
one
missed
in
my
book
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
richness
to
the
malts
these
were
however
hard
to
find
at
times
they
come
strong
at
the
start
and
give
great
flavoring
char
and
roast
but
by
the
end
everything
is
washed
with
thinness
and
water
diluting
the
original
strength
additionally
the
coloring
is
nice
and
the
head
and
bubbles
upon
swirling
produced
an
attractive
beer
but
the
follow
through
on
the
sip
and
the
feel
fell
a
little
short
for
us
overall
its
just
an
average
sort
of
stout
they
dont
use
actual
chocolate
just
chocolate
malt
its
kind
of
a
rip
off
to
call
it
a
chocolate
stout
when
they
only
the
malts
which
is
pretty
standard
for
a
stout
malt
bill
anyway
and
not
chocolate
especially
when
its
pretty
weak
too
overall
lighter
than
some
of
its
counterparts
which
is
nice
because
sometimes
you
might
want
a
chocolate
stout
without
an
insane
abv
and
richnesssweetness
a
nice
beer
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
no
one
element
stuck
out
but
still
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
decent
chocolate
stout
though
i
prefer
their
doubled
version
of
it
a
good
drinking
beer
from
a
pint
glass
this
is
better
for
social
occasions
and
would
easily
mix
well
with
bar
food
check
the
brewerys
website
for
their
great
chocolate
stout
chili
recipe
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
pretty
average
american
stout
this
beer
was
called
a
chocolate
stout
but
i
dont
think
there
was
enough
chocolate
presence
to
make
this
stick
out
from
just
a
regular
american
stout
this
beer
went
down
smooth
but
the
flavor
didnt
really
hold
my
interest
so
i
dont
think
i
would
want
another
one
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
looked
pretty
proper
for
an
american
stout
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
lack
of
chocolate
taste
and
the
watery
mouthfeel
if
those
were
fixed
this
beer
wouldnt
be
half
bad
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
and
wouldnt
recommend
it
their
are
much
better
chocolate
stouts
to
be
found
this
beer
really
didnt
do
it
for
me
and
it
didnt
make
for
a
good
first
impression
for
this
brewery
i
would
like
to
have
a
couple
more
beers
from
them
before
i
fully
form
an
opinion
on
this
brewery
but
after
having
this
beer
i
wont
be
in
a
hurry
to
try
their
other
beers
hopefully
they
are
better
then
this
one
better
luck
next
time
guys
acquired
this
out
of
curiosity
didnt
curiosity
kill
the
cat
anyway
poured
a
half
finger
head
with
okay
reception
hints
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
which
gave
away
the
taste
quite
easily
yepp
taste
it
similar
to
smell
but
has
a
suprisingly
good
but
plain
finish
not
sure
if
thats
a
good
or
bad
thing
the
creamy
texture
sticks
to
the
palate
but
probably
to
the
ribs
as
well
overall
this
is
an
okay
stout
not
a
lip
smacker
but
was
worth
a
try
overall
disappointing
i
was
hoping
for
more
with
this
one
it
reminded
me
of
a
black
lager
than
a
stout
needs
more
chocolate
to
be
called
chocolate
stout
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
after
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
was
only
so
so
and
the
mouthfeel
was
a
real
bummer
surely
not
up
to
par
with
many
of
the
chocolate
stouts
that
are
out
there
feel
medium
to
full
bodied
and
smooth
not
thick
or
creamy
overall
i
would
say
this
beer
is
better
than
average
it
is
quite
drinkable
with
some
subtle
enjoyable
qualities

overall
im
a
bit
dissapointed
with
this
one
there
are
some
decent
flavors
here
but
its
all
watered
down
the
light
mouthfeel
and
higher
carb
accentuate
this
cleaning
the
palate
of
any
flavors
that
may
have
tried
to
linger
better
than
a
macro
but
not
by
very
much
mediocre
sorry
fcb
pains
me
to
say
it
o
a
pleasant
chocolate
stout
overall
a
slightly
below
average
beer
aroma
is
good
but
everything
else
is
lacking
wouldnt
recommend
o
its
a
well
balance
stout
that
id
consider
this
a
session
stout
just
a
no
frills
good
drink
one
that
wont
fill
ya
up
because
its
so
heavy
but
also
wont
knock
you
on
the
ground
with
a
high
abv
definitely
worth
checking
out
overall
i
would
drink
this
stout
again
and
again
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
affordable
chocolate
stout
definitely
recommended
and
probably
my
favorite
fort
collins
beer
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
i
liked
the
combination
of
the
sweet
chocolatey
malts
and
the
roasted
malts
make
for
a
great
overall
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
flavor
opaque
dark
brown
pour
with
a
mocha
head
getting
live
and
leaving
a
good
trace
of
lacing
milky
chocolatey
mocha
and
cocoa
notes
hitting
the
nose
with
the
same
on
the
palate
some
malty
grain
offsetting
some
full
bodied
chocolate
flavor
very
well
carbonated
and
solid
goto
if
you
dig
stouts
actually
enjoy
it
better
than
the
older
brother
2x
chocolate
o
a
decent
chocolate
stout
an
average
stout
though
definitely
would
buy
this
again
it
might
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
fort
collins
brewery
o
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
straight
forward
no
frills
chococlate
stout
at
5
3
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
if
you
wanted
something
dark
and
sweet
carbonation
is
high
on
this
guy
it
bites
the
tongue
upon
sipping
and
helps
the
mineral
taste
make
the
beginning
of
the
sip
less
pleasant
than
it
could
be
once
the
bite
from
this
12
punch
passes
its
a
lot
more
drinkable
but
its
too
thin
o
decent
chocolate
stout
i
prefer
a
stronger
one
like
the
souther
tier
choklat
or
rogue
double
chocolate
again
there
are
so
many
outrageous
ones
out
there
that
we
tend
to
downplay
the
simpler
ones
this
is
to
the
point
my
bartender
buddy
moe
used
to
say
that
i
took
my
coffee
like
my
women
hot
black
and
the
sooner
the
better
ah
yes
this
beer
poured
fast
and
back
and
gave
some
serious
mocha
head
before
moving
on
to
more
important
things
like
the
nose
it
smelled
like
hersheys
special
dark
chocolate
and
i
was
thinking
of
several
special
treats
that
i
might
like
from
a
chocolate
stout
color
was
a
dense
deepbrown
not
black
but
what
actually
is
solid
black
other
than
carbon
mouthfeel
was
indeed
velvety
smooth
like
marvin
gaye
on
the
turntable
lets
get
it
on
the
lacing
was
thick
and
sticky
and
i
was
licking
my
moustache
like
the
flavor
saver
it
had
become
the
taste
was
of
liquid
dark
chocolate
no
sweet
nonsense
here
man
this
was
cacao
being
ladled
out
by
one
of
montazumas
girls
and
i
was
lapping
it
up
like
it
was
going
out
of
style
finish
left
me
spent
and
sleepy
hey
whos
going
to
clean
up
that
mess
the
sticky
lacing
left
behind
in
the
glass
i
mean
i
think
that
i
may
be
compelled
to
buy
a
certain
young
lady
a
drink
come
sunday
yo
ya
feel
me
o
a
good
brew
o
not
a
worthy
entry
into
one
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
pours
a
creamy
dark
brown
color
with
a
subtle
tan
head
smells
bitter
like
raw
unrefined
dark
chocolate
and
even
some
bittering
hops
unusual
for
the
style
taste
is
more
dark
malts
than
chocolate
not
sweet
in
any
way
like
semisweet
chocolate
chips
in
the
finish
slightly
thin
in
the
body
for
what
i
look
for
in
a
stout
but
one
of
the
better
fort
collins
brews
i
have
tried
very
drinkable
and
has
some
potentially
exciting
cullinary
applications
worthy
of
a
try
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
but
dont
expect
a
chocolate
knockout
this
is
a
sessionable
dry
type
stout
with
just
a
touch
of
the
cocoa
o
a
decent
beer
that
i
did
enjoy
will
be
happy
to
have
again
but
not
anything
to
write
home
about
o
an
enjoyable
stout
its
not
the
best
and
its
not
the
most
memorable
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
it
so
i
cant
complain
poured
out
into
a
pint
glass
and
was
surprised
not
to
see
much
of
a
head
considering
the
style
it
also
didnt
have
much
of
an
aroma
to
it
the
aroma
i
did
get
was
like
sticking
my
nose
in
a
fresh
bag
of
toasted
malt
caramel
flavor
and
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
are
the
flavor
notes
i
get
from
this
one
hops
are
well
balance
and
stay
in
the
background
to
provide
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
i
like
this
beer
and
might
have
to
pick
it
up
again
very
soon
picked
up
with
a
pick
your
own
six
pack
poured
from
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
inky
black
with
little
head
notes
of
roasted
malt
with
little
in
way
of
chocolate
a
good
american
stout
but
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
there
are
a
lot
of
other
stouts
out
there
that
i
like
better
not
a
bad
stout
but
theres
nothing
to
separate
this
one
from
the
pack
its
simple
and
pleasing
but
hardly
profound
pours
a
really
nice
darkchocolate
black
with
brown
coming
through
on
the
edges
a
nice
creamy
chunky
mocha
head
dissipates
just
a
little
leaving
a
layer
of
creamy
froth
on
top
all
the
way
down
leaves
great
sticky
lacing
tastes
of
burnt
chocolate
roasted
malt
bitterness
and
maybe
a
touch
of
oatmeal
definitely
a
lot
of
chalky
semisweet
chocolate
in
here
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slightly
dry
very
sessionable
this
really
does
remind
me
more
of
an
oatmeal
stout
with
a
nice
sort
of
hearty
creaminess
in
the
body
a
good
beer
in
my
opinion
for
those
times
when
you
just
want
to
try
something
new
nothing
groundbreaking
here
just
a
good
solid
stout
poured
into
a
snifter
i
am
met
with
a
black
brew
with
a
nice
beige
head
that
dissolves
quickly
and
leaves
a
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
lot
of
chocolate
going
for
it
with
some
leather
and
cocoa
also
the
taste
is
filled
with
dark
chocolate
tobacco
and
roasted
malts
bitter
finish
the
added
hops
really
distract
from
the
overall
beer
and
create
some
harshness
when
i
dont
feel
its
needed
overall
for
the
style
its
not
bad
but
with
the
ris
all
the
craze
this
american
stout
is
just
average
the
mouthfeel
is
way
too
thin
for
what
is
expected
these
days
in
a
stout
i
must
admit
i
may
be
influenced
by
the
vast
array
of
awesome
stouts
and
imperial
stouts
available
today
this
one
borders
on
simple
but
may
appeal
to
some
m
medium
body
light
carbonation
o
a
tasty
well
crafted
brew
at
a
great
price
point
recommended
not
much
of
a
scentnose
to
it
malty
if
anything
taste
is
a
tad
more
french
roast
coffee
than
chocolate
and
a
touch
too
bitter
o
i
was
left
hoping
for
some
more
chocolate
in
this
beer
the
roasted
malts
are
too
predominant
the
watery
flavor
couple
with
the
aforementioned
smell
left
me
a
bit
disappointed
overall
this
is
average
at
best
just
too
thin
overly
roasted
and
kind
of
bland
for
a
stout
pass
odissapointing
was
expecting
a
lot
from
this
beer
may
have
been
okay
if
i
wasnt
expecting
chocolate
from
a
chocolate
stout
overall
it
was
good
quality
and
drinkable
it
was
also
dissapointing
for
what
i
expected
i
expected
some
chocolate
flavors
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
12
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
foamy
broken
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
beans
and
slight
cocoa
powderchocolate
aromas
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
burnt
coffee
and
a
subdued
bitter
chocolate
flavor
for
being
a
chocolate
stout
there
is
much
more
of
a
coffee
flavor
in
this
one
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
but
like
i
said
this
is
very
light
on
the
chocolate
with
more
emphasis
on
coffee
smells
and
flavors
overall
a
beer
that
is
meh
good
but
not
great
and
not
good
enough
to
warrant
a
second
look
or
purchase
i
feel
like
this
beers
grain
bill
was
shorted
or
cheated
and
it
is
flawed
in
ways
a
stout
typically
isnt
the
purpose
was
a
chocolate
stout
and
that
is
a
epic
failure
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
very
small
head
smell
is
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
taste
is
good
chocolateroasted
malts
some
notes
of
coffee
very
flavorful
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
o
decent
as
far
as
stouts
go
well
bodied
stout
with
a
good
flavor
overall
the
beer
is
okay
nothing
exciting
but
quite
drinkable
there
are
lots
of
better
options
to
drink
within
this
style
however
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
one
again
o
a
nice
lower
alcohol
stout
good
flavours
here
an
enjoyable
effort
it
may
fall
short
in
comparison
but
its
still
pretty
good
im
loving
this
paper
cup
though
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
stout
manages
to
avoid
the
pitfall
of
having
a
weak
taste
while
being
a
lower
abv
stout
but
this
still
hurts
it
in
the
mouthfeel
it
just
needs
to
be
thicker
other
than
that
the
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
papery
side
could
have
been
better
would
like
to
try
to
the
double
version
of
this
to
see
if
that
improves
the
experience
d
for
a
huge
fan
of
roast
and
coffee
doable
but
not
as
attractive
to
the
general
public
as
a
chocolate
stout
should
be
o
decent
beer
with
an
odd
use
of
smoked
malts
patent
malts
add
a
good
bit
of
over
the
top
astringency
and
acridity
but
is
made
up
in
the
beers
smoothness
good
beer
with
a
nice
robust
cigar
perhaps
pours
black
with
brown
tints
a
mocha
head
that
fades
fast
the
smell
is
amazing
the
chocolate
smell
mixes
with
a
heavy
smoky
malt
the
smoky
malt
comes
through
big
up
front
with
the
chocolate
finishing
the
smoke
lasts
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
a
light
medium
this
one
could
have
been
thicker
to
add
to
the
smoothness
the
overall
beer
is
enjoyable
good
flavors
dominate
the
lack
of
thickness
worth
checking
out
not
a
beer
i
feel
that
id
look
out
on
a
normal
basis
seems
thin
and
just
too
burnt
and
smoky
for
my
tastes
not
much
chocolate
in
this
chocolate
stout
poured
from
bottle
to
a
tulip
dark
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
left
too
soon
the
smell
is
not
too
bad
dark
baking
choclate
roasted
coffeemalts
taste
was
semi
sweet
dark
baking
chocolates
with
coffee
notes
a
little
hop
bitterness
on
the
end
with
some
coffee
bitterness
as
well
i
dont
like
a
lot
of
sweetness
is
my
chocolate
stouts
and
this
is
about
right
for
my
taste
maybe
a
little
under
sweet
for
some
mouthfeel
was
too
thin
and
watery
for
me
overall
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
off
for
me
but
the
smell
and
taste
were
pretty
good
and
that
it
more
important
to
me
i
bought
a
sixer
and
will
age
a
few
and
see
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
rich
deep
brown
color
that
looks
to
be
nearly
black
the
head
is
thick
and
tan
at
first
that
fades
into
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
burnt
toast
and
chocolate
the
taste
gives
off
a
roasted
bitter
chocolate
flavor
a
slight
sweet
malt
aftertaste
the
mouthfeels
not
as
thick
as
i
felt
it
should
be
but
this
was
a
decent
stout
overall
o
it
is
alright
i
just
cant
get
past
the
ashy
taste
drinkability
is
good
worth
a
try
but
also
not
a
stout
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
a
hold
of
overall
synergistic
qualities
of
the
coffeechocolate
and
alcohol
mesh
into
a
elegant
beer
if
that
is
possible
from
a
stout
overall
a
bit
underwhelming
on
the
flavor
but
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
really
makes
up
for
it
tasteroasted
coffee
dark
chocolate
nice
underlying
hop
bite
stays
on
to
the
finish
smooth
roasty
tasty
a
great
match
for
any
grilled
beef
a
must
for
lovers
of
flavorfull
stouts
or
robust
porters
o
it
was
ok
the
aroma
and
flavors
were
fine
but
the
mouthfeel
really
killed
it
for
me
overall
i
like
another
average
check
on
the
stout
list
it
contained
all
the
elements
of
a
stout
but
left
me
wanting
more
boldness
and
body
very
goodquite
surprised
by
the
hop
bite
at
the
end
would
have
again
drinkability
straight
forward
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watered
down
decent
stuff
but
not
extraordinary
d
o
first
time
ive
noticed
the
change
not
the
most
exciting
but
good
average
it
got
the
job
done
and
far
more
enjoyable
than
the
beer
garden
swill
d
a
great
everyday
stout
it
packs
the
nice
chocolate
flavor
in
while
remaining
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
well
i
had
hoped
this
beer
was
going
to
be
really
good
it
wasnt
horrible
but
it
paled
in
comparison
to
some
other
stouts
ive
had
it
was
drinkable
and
i
could
have
another
but
i
want
something
a
bit
more
balanced
and
robust
in
my
stouts
drinkability
very
good
for
a
stout
the
best
flavors
and
aromas
linger
nicely
but
the
bitter
qualities
fade
away
got
a
six
pack
of
this
for
my
wife
who
loves
chocolate
its
a
solid
beer
i
have
no
complaints
its
not
exceptional
you
get
a
bit
of
dark
malt
with
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
with
a
mediocre
aftertaste
its
a
beer
i
can
drink
with
dinner
or
drink
two
or
three
or
clear
my
pallet
with
a
bit
its
light
for
a
stout
but
i
enjoyed
it
somewhat
im
not
impressed
with
fcb
so
far
drinkability
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
coming
from
fcb
a
little
disappointed
and
will
not
be
buying
another
6pack
of
this
not
a
bad
sipper
for
a
cold
day
but
there
are
much
better
representations
of
the
style
out
there
beer
lacks
balance
to
be
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
regularly
if
they
would
perhaps
add
a
little
milk
chocolate
to
keep
up
with
the
bitterness
it
would
help
think
ill
pass
next
time
im
ruined
for
rogues
chocolate
stout
drinkability
wow
this
one
left
me
wanting
burnt
and
ashy
meets
sweet
and
chocolaty
no
thanks
d
take
a
guess
wont
revisit
d
somewhat
smooth
beer
with
a
malty
backbone
hints
of
chocolate
appear
more
so
in
aroma
than
taste
somewhat
mildbland
perhaps
a
good
session
stout
drinkability
was
good
no
signs
of
abv
lightly
toasty
stout
it
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
coats
the
mouth
nicely
i
can
drink
it
but
its
nothing
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
thin
bad
aftertaste
im
not
a
fan
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
and
if
so
ill
edit
because
i
have
a
few
more
from
this
6pack
to
try
definitely
wont
buy
again
d
its
drinkable
but
not
really
remarkable
besides
the
review
i
wont
buy
this
again
it
poured
very
dark
from
the
bottle
to
the
beer
mug
thin
head
that
quickly
disappeared
as
did
any
lacing
smell
dominated
by
molasses
with
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
taste
didnt
exactly
match
the
smell
sweet
and
roasted
malts
on
the
front
end
and
dark
chocolate
on
the
back
end
and
it
stayed
with
ya
for
a
bit
mouthfeel
was
week
and
its
not
complex
at
all
however
its
extremely
drinkable
and

wasnt

ruled

the
chocolate
came
thru
on
the
finish
of
this
medium
bodied
brew
that
had
desent
carbonation
d
its
drinkable
but
its
not
really
something
to
look
forward
to
it
seems
to
me
that
the
beer
only
shines
through
its
smell
drink
not
too
bad
a
solid
effort
for
a
market
flooded
with
stouts
drinkability
is
okay
taste
is
nice

not
very
good
either
way
i
probably
would
not
turn
this

down

i
would
never
go
out

one
of

at

what

nothing

i
like

its

have
the

choices
that
make

just

though
just
not
super
interesting
dr
one
after
dinner
is
good
o
not

really
like
this
version
of
the
style
nice
head
at
the
pour
with
good
tan
color
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
malts
and
roasted
oats
are
in
the
nose
the
nice
chocolate
malts
really
make
this
beer
taste
good
bit
of
hops
in
the
end
and
some
roasted
notes
in
the
mouth
overall
i
would
get
this
brew
again
not
a
bad
price
and
really
a
good
show
for
this
style
this
beer
looks
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
fringes
when
held
to
the
light
with
a
fast
dissolving
beige
foam
head
the
smell
is
of
a
nice
coffee
and
some
brown
sugarmolasses
sweetness
there
is
the
mocha
aroma
that
does
appear
with
the
mixture
of
the
coffee
it
makes
a
nice
mocha
aroma
the
flavor
is
fairly
similar
but
not
as
potent
on
any
of
the
flavors
there
is
a
chocolate
backer
for
the
most
part
the
flavors
are
weak
but
none
of
them
are
offputting
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
watery
for
a
stout
and
i
blame
the
thinness
of
this
stout
as
to
the
main
reason
that
i
dont
much
care
for
it
it
does
drink
really
nicely
so
it
has
that
going
for
it
its
a
good
beer
but
its
not
great
this
was
a
great
beer
glad
to
have
picked
it
up
would
definately
drink
again

good
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
lot
but
i
liked
it
like
it
ok
this
one
was
a
dark

was
a

on

the

one
on

in

i
defiintely

better

out

this
one
is

enough
d
this
was
a
decent
chocolate
stout
not
much
coming
off
the
nose
but
there
are
some
chocolate
flavors
try
if
you
get
the
chance
but
there
are
better
chocolate
stouts
out
there
drinkability
sure
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
night
but
not
often
i
like
it
as
a
porter
so
id
advise
ft
collins
to
keep
bottling
this
one
and
change
the
name
to
fort
collins

it
is
an

for

a

would
have

it

as
the

warmed

character
was

thinner
and
rather
disappointing
for

moderate

the

lite
aint
that
cheap
friends
i
figured
what
the
hell
and
i
gave
it
a
shot
sooo
glad
i
did
this
stout
is
sooo
smooth
musicjustintime
prune
juice
colored
beer
with
a
rich
chocolate
aroma
the
taste
is
chocolate
with
a
toasted
aftertaste
smooth
beer
that
goes
down
pretty
easy
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
and
recommend
it
to
my
buddies
overall
a
decent
beer
although
2
or
3
at
a
sitting
probably
will
be
plenty

the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
a
half
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and

are
both
low
the
aroma
is
very
malty
it
smells
like
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
some
coffee
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
unfortunately
the
taste
seems
a
little
weak
to
me
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
i
wish
the
taste
was
stronger
i
figured
with
it
being
a
chocolate
stout
lackluster
overall
but
decent
you
can
get
so
much
better

overall
a
very
easy
drinking
american
stout
mouthfeel
is
creamy
as
style
should
be
and
nothing
cloying
or
sticky
remains
only
the
hint
of
light
chocolate
d
a
nice
chocolate
stout
if
you
like
roasty
it
could
definitely
use
a
boost
in
mouthfeel
but
i
would
try
this
one
again
i
would
drink
this
again
but
not
more
than
one
in
a
setting
worth
trying
but
dont
expect
something
great
taste
in
the
flavor
the
coffee
and
roasted
malts
stand
out
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
with
the
chocolate
being
more
a
complimentary
flavor
than
a
dominant
one
i
dont
mind
this
as
i
usually
prefer
a
more
roasted
flavor
in
my
stouts
theres
also
a
bit
of
a
hop
bitterness
going
on
mouthfeel
is
very
much
on
the
thin
side
but
the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
hate
to
be
so
hard
on
this
ale
but
this
chocolate
stout
is
awful
12
ounce
bottle
with
no
label
this
one
was
grabbed
out
of
a
sixer
and
wouldnt
you
know
that
i
got
the
one
without
any
label
looks
better
than
it
drinks
but
doesnt
drink
that
bad
chocolate
stout
is
a
good
effort
and
is
one
that
i
have
no
trouble
recommending
to
those
who
think
they
might
like
a
hoppier
than
usual
fullflavored
lightbodied
session
stout
ive
only
had
three
fort
collins
beers
so
far
but
this
one
and
kidd
lager
a
schwarzbier
make
me
think
theyre
on
the
right
track
bottom
line
a
very
nice
chocolate
stout
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
dark
brown
very
aromatic
and
fairly
intense
in
its
nose
roasted
black
and
chocolate
malt
waft
up
through
the
glass
along
with
a
touch
of
burnt
fruits
and
smoke
intensity
is
haulted
once
the
beer
is
tasted
but
the
malt
flavor
is
still
very
complex
and
well
balanced
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
combine
with
a
nice
dry
cocoa
feel
and
a
touch
of
burnt
dark
fruits
on
the
finish
fairly
good
but
not
great
dark
chocolatey
black
with
a
dense
soft
cushiony
head
of

brown
nice

nose
is
full
of
rich

and
even
some

there

as
well
roasted

toasted

up

soon
turns
chocolate

sweet
with
a

background
finish
is
more
reminiscent
of
dark
chocolate
mediumbodied
stout
with
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
solid
but
not
great
overall
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
but
it
isnt
anywhere
near
the
top
chocolate
stout
its
not
a
horrible
beer
by
any
means
but
it
just
doesnt
grab
me
like
i
was
hoping
thanks
for
throwing
one
my
way
zap
very
drinkable
despite
all
the
flavors
dancing
in
your
mouth
tasty
beer
could
pass
itself
off
as
non
chocolate
without
much
trouble
imo
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
brown
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
roasted
chocolate
and
crystal
malt
scent
that
is
sweet
as
well
as
dry
and
earthy
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
an
earthy
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
but
finishes
slightly
sweet
and
dry
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
but
not
their
best
for
sure
i
think
rogue
has
the
market
for
this
style
i
definately
prefer
sweet
to
dry
and
earthy
note
on
stouts
ive
got
a
lot
to
learn
i
used
to
think
that
guiness
was
it
nope
there
is
a
lot
more
to
it
than
that
i
hate
guiness
but
am
learning
that
there
are
many
sweet
stouts
out
there
that
are
just
glorius
this
is
one
if
you
dont
like
guiness
but
want
a
rich
beer
try
this
dont
be
afraid
of
the
word
stout
mdr
nicely
carbonated
and
a
good
medium
body
but
i
liked
this
brew
less
than
my
rating
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
sweeter
or
chocolate
taste
on
something
called
a
chocolate
stout
but
as
a
stout
it
was
tasty
so
i
had
to
give
it
a
4
pours
thin
but
opaque
with
little
to
no
head
has
a
very
nice
roasty
aroma
flavor
is
clean
and
dry
with
lots
of
pleasant
roasty
toasty
goodness
in
the
finish
big
beer
snobs
take
note
this
is
much
more
of
a
dry
stout
than
a
big
thick
impy
i
find
it
to
be
extremely
pleasant
and
drinkable
in
the
way
a
good
mellow
dry
stout
should
be
rereviewed
21112newly
available
to
our
area
16
99
for
a
mixed
12pack
sampler
calling
a
beer
a
chocolate
stout
when
it
contains
no
chocolate
is
called
a
cheap
marketing
gimmick
i
stand
by
my
original
review
this
is
a
flimsy
stout
more
of
a
porter
its
a
bit
too
acidic
and
minerally
herbal
hops
flimsy
body
burnt
finish
i
have
to
add
now
that
it
is
available
in
our
area
im
not
inclined
to
buy
it
again
there
are
much
better
porters
and
stouts
for
that
matter
for
the
same
pricepoint
and
it
doesnt
taste
at
all
like
bells
porter
or
what
it
used
to
be
hrmmm
12
ounce
bottle
this
beer
pours
out
a
black
color
with
half
an
inch
of
brown
head
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
aroma
with
some
unexpected
hamlike
smokiness
roasted
malt
flavor
but
i
dont
detect
any
chocolate
more
smokiness
slightly
astringent
some
hops
in
the
finish
medium
mouthfeel
decent
drinkability
i
was
hoping
there
would
be
more
chocolate
in
the
flavor
but
this
is
a
decent
beer
anyway
the
smokiness
sort
of
works
a
final
side
note
a
little
later
on
i
nursed
this
while
i
ate
a
piece
of
chocolate
cake
the
coffee
flavors
and
light
hoppiness
were
a
nice
match
for
the
sweetness
of
the
cake
maybe
this
is
one
to
enjoy
by
association
rather
than
on
its
own
overall
a
fairly
decent
brew
but
a
bit
thin
and
sour
better
warm
the
champagne
body
is
nice
and
gives
the
beer
more
heft
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
i
used
to
drink
hc
bergers
beers
in
college
and
im
glad
hes
back
in
business
this
is
a
good
beer
from
a
good
brewer
pours
a
standard
stout
black
with
a
disappointing
total
lack
of
head
a
few
tan
wisps
of
foam
are
all
there
is
to
see
here
smell
is
actually
quite
nice
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
malt
aromas
with
an
underlying
hop
presence
taste
is
another
let
down
after
the
promising
nose
some
bitter
burnt
coffee
and
a
substantial
hop
bite
quite
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
would
have
guessed
and
hoppier
than
i
like
in
a
stout
let
alone
a
chocolate
stout
mouthfeel
is
enjoyably
carbonated
and
smooth
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
stout
but
disappointing
as
chocolate
stout
worth
a
try
if
you
like
a
hoppier
stout
though
just
not
sweet
or
matly
enough
for
my
tastes
first
sip
reveals
a
very
silky
smooth
body
with
fine
gentle
carbonation
flavor
is
deep
chocolate
sweetness
and
some
roasted
malt
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
faint
grassy
hop
that
pokes
through
the
chocolate
very
briefly
but
is
quickly
overtaken
by
the
chocolate
sweetness
very
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
a
nice
beer
not
quite
as
thick
as
i
would
expect
though
how
a
brewery
can
ace
a
smoked
lager
and
completely
fuck
up
a
basic
stout
is
beyond
me
dark
brown
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
hint
of
red
cocoa
foam
fades
after
a
few
minutes
leaving
some
lace
nose
is
roasted
grain
chocolate
overtones
yeast
and
coffee
initial
taste
is
sweet
but
finishes
with
a
semisweet
chocolate
that
is
interesting
just
enough
hops
to
keep
this
stout
from
being
cloyingly
chocolaty
finish
is
nicely
dry
leaving
a
whole
wheat
bread
aftertaste
carbonation
is
gentle
just
right
body
is
slightly
thick
but
goes
down
easy
a
good
comparison
would
be
with
the
standard
youngs
double
chocolate
stout

with
which
ft
collins
offering
compares
favorably
its
quite
easy
to
drink
but
not
exactly
what
i
would
call
flavorful
its
fairly
one
sided
on
the
other
hand
its
not
bad
and
this
6
pack
will
find
its
place
overall
a
pretty
good
chocolate
stout
its
got
an
exploding
stout
head
tan
like
the
bleached
hair
on
bacchus
temples
the
color
of
the
darkest
grains
in
the
darkest
wood
nice
fruit
compote
aroma
like
a
dried
fruit
wreath
dried
pit
fruits
with
the
stems
and
pits
and
all
holy
shit
tastes
like
cocoa
straight
up
a
dry
hop
vapor
fills
the
mouth
dads
burnt
biscuits
the
carbonation
turns
the
malt
from
any
fruitiness
to
melted
bakers
chocolate
a
caramelized
fruit
quickly
burns
up
in
a
smokey
malt
fire
cloud
poof
its
gone
o
big
flavor
especially
for
the
abv
fair
a
slight
dryness
odd
taste
for
a
stout
that
i
dint
find
complimentary
for
a
stout
likely
the
chicory
interesting
yet
unbalanced
tastes
like
the
name
suggests
great
flavor
one
of
my
favorites
wish
they
still
sold
this
in
bottles
its
likely
a
great
candidate
for
750ml
bottles
pours
a
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
smoke
and
coffee
the
taste
was
very
smokey
with
all
of
the
great
chicory
coffee
coming
through
on
the
end
to
make
this
a
very
tasty
beer
i
also
liked
that
it
was
low
alcohol
which
allowed
me
to
enjoy
several
tasted
like
a
dirty
ashtray
nothing
spectacular
but
im
going
3
25
now
instead
of
2
75
or
3
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
this
tasting
was
more
impressive
than
i
recalled
reversing
the
normal
trend
for
retastes
ill
have
to
give
this
another
shot
to
see
if
it
holds
up
year
after
year
not
a
bad
beer
but
you
really
need
to
like
chicory
the
coffee
notes
and
smell
is
nice
a
bit
too
much
chicory
favor
for
this
guy
o
if
you
like
coffeeinfused
beers
this
one
is
a
standout
the
chicory
reminds
me
of
a
community
coffee
new
orleans
blend
recommended
032812
an
astringent
dry
finish
a
bit
of
a
surprise
it
appears
the
bitter
of
the
hops
has
been
replaced
with
the
astringency
of
the
chicory
i
know
chicory
is
used
in
new
orleans
as
a
flavor
enhancer
for
coffee
dh
brags
of
it
in
their
blurb
but
it
was
not
particularly
coffeeish
the
flavor
does
not
disappoint
with
ample
amounts
of
coffee
as
advertised
more
roast
and
a
somewhat
spicy
bittersweet
chocolate
finish
it
is
surprisingly
full
flavored
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
i
cannot
differentiate
between
the
chicory
and
coffee
flavors
personally
overall
the
only
weakness
is
a
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
which
is
a
small
gripe
for
such
a
great
beer
i
purchase
this
one
without
hesitation
anytime
i
see
it
on
the
shelf
o
patience
is
rewarded
on
a
cold
tap
pour
there
are
a
lot
of
bitter
coffee
notes
as
it
warms
all
of
the
notes
are
in
harmony
and
it
is
delicious
this
stout
pours
a
near
black
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
packed
with
bitter
roasted
coffee
and
bitter
dark
cacao
the
mouth
is
smooth
and
surprisingly
light
i
actually
wish
it
had
a
little
bit
more
body
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
with
an
abundance
of
bitter
coffee
and
chocolate
as
well
as
burnt
dried
fruit
and
a
little
sweet
malt
to
balance
the
bitter
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
stout
and
quite
easy
to
drink
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
it
again
down
the
road
overall
what
can
be
said
about
this
that
hasnt
been
already
its
a
tasty
complex
stout
that
was
on
the
shelves
long
before
most
of
the
popular
dark
beers
that
saturate
the
market
contemporarily
worth
your
money
taste
is
as

but
with
more
noticeable
chicory
coffee
element
but
still
very
light

o
a
decent
stout
but
the
bitter
and
astringent
flavors
seem
overdone
head
is
a
little
thin
very
very
minimal
lacing
the
color
is
much
too
light
and
the
mouth
feel
is
too
thin
the
carbonation
is
a
little
overpowering
i
get
chocolate
in
the
taste
but
the
coffee
is
very
shy
to
non
existent
though
i
do
like
my
coffee
presence
to
punch
you
in
the
face
well
balanced
for
the
most
part
and
smooth
the
smell
leaves
much
to
be
desired
overall
an
okay
stout
thats
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
introductory
stout
to
those
who
dont
drink
them
cheers
all
in
all
i
really
like
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
with
breakfast
and
forget
im
drinking
a
beer
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
will
recommend
this
beer
to
many
of
my
friends
this
beer
is
like
that
stop
at
arbys
when
youre
on
the
way
up
to
the
lake
mediocre
functional
unexciting
but
serves
it
purpose
nothing
interesting
here
right
down
the
doubleyellow
line
of
average
o
overall
while
it
seems
to
be
a
good
stout
and
all
the
parts
come
together
to
play
a
decent
concert
it
is
not
something
that
i
will
rush
back
to
all
that
soon
this
is
as
close
to
a
cup
of
black
coffee
as
you
can
get
in
a
stout
without
being
labelled

it
is

overall
the
chicory
provides
this
beer
with
an
interesting
taste
its
not
a
beer
that
id
want
a
whole
lot
of
but
the
the
taste
is
different
enough
that
it
warrants
trying
at
least
once
overall
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
that
really
impressed
me
it
fell
a
bit
short
of
my
expectations
just
didnt
quite
have
enough
flavor
for
me
if
your
looking
for
a
lighter
bodied
easy
drinking
stout
this
is
great
i
wouldnt
say
dogfish
missed
on
this
but
definitely
not
one
of
there
best
pieces
of
work
pours
into
a
glass
like
dark
coffee
smell
of
coffee
whiskey
like
smoky
hints
and
some
roasted
malti
guess
chicory
the
tastes
packs
a
bit
more
kick
then
i
was
expecting
very
acidic
tasting
slightly
dry
finish
despite
having
a
vaguely
creamy
feel
while
in
the
mouth
the
taste
is
a
bit
like
coffee
mixed
with
some
raisin
and
roasted
and
toasted
grain
i
like
the
taste
and
most
things
about
the
beer
but
i
do
feel
its
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
the
carbonation
also
kind
of
makes
it
feel
more
biting
then
i
was
anticipating
for
a
stout
all
in
all
i
like
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
one
i
will
be
getting
as
a
staple
also
as
far
as
seasonal
winter
beers
go
there
are
a
bunch
of
others
i
feel
like
are
more
satisfying
in
this
capacity
this
is
worth
trying
if
you
havent
tried
it
yet
though
actually
a
pretty
good
overall
stout
not
sure
what
chickory
should
taste
like
but
the
coffee
is
apparent
in
the
smell
and
tase
and
welcoming
pours
a
deep
thick
brown
onto
my
chalice
head
is
somewhat
khaki
with
no
lacing
the
maltiness
and
joe
are
apparent
in
both
smell
and
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
overall
a
sessionable
stout
but
not
necessarily
my
go
to
stout
a
flavorful
stout
that
could
hold
its
own
against
the
many
a
bigger
stout
it
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
lot
of
foam

up
the
aroma
of
chocolaty
cocoa
nibs
and
some
roast
maybe
a
touch
of
coffeewhich
i
didnt
realize
was
from
actual
coffee
this
is
a
fullflavored
brewit
has
a
lactic
bite
with
an
edge
and
a
sharp
finish
if
i
knew
what
chicory
was
i
could
probably
identify
those
notes
too
overall
i
wasnt
unhappy
to
pay
for
a
6
99
growler
of
it
its
a
slightly
different
take
on
a
typical
stout
and
not
a
bad
winter
drinker
oaverage
at
best
but
still
enjoyable
prob
would
order
at
a
restaurant
or
try
again
but
would
never
purchase
a
four
pack
o
excellent
stout
im
assuming
it
didnt
wow
me
because
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
chicory
whats
nice
is
it
is
something
that
didnt
stand
out
and
become
offensive
pours
jet
black
with
a
thick
mocha
that
sticks
around
and
sports
some
nice
lacing
aroma
of
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
smells
wonderful
taste
follows
the
nose
but
without
the
pop
muted
coffee
and
chocolate
i
mean
its
tasty
just
not
wow
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
good
regular
drinking
stout
o
an
ok
beer
tasty
and
subtle
not
very
strong
or
heavy
just
not
too
exciting
overall
overall
quite
enjoyable
and
a
refreshing
light
take
on
a
stout
with
some
good
flavor
o
a
very
nice
standard
american
stout
has
the
robustness
i
like
in
a
stout
plus
a
little
smokiness
will
drink
again
o
overall
a
really
nice
smooth
roastysmokey
brew
pretty
refreshing
given
the
colorstyle
overall
more
was
anticipated
from
this
beer
and
its
fairly
light
for
a
stout
its
a
bit
light
for
my
liking
ill
be
interested
in
holding
on
to
a
bottle
or
two
to
see
how
it
changes
over
time
o
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
dfh
on
this
one
but
it
wasnt
terrible
and
i
dont
like
coffee
at
all
if
coffees
your
thing
you
could
easily
down
a
six
of
this
as
for
myself
i
bought
two
and
i
love
dfh
but
i
may
give
the
second
one
away
a
nice
twist
on
a
really
excellent
stout
this
beer
pours
very
dark
like
a
heavy
coffee
with
a
thin
light
head
smells
like
root
vegetables
and
coffee
with
an
overwhelming
roasted
aroma
taste
like
an
english
style
stout
but
with
espresso
notes
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
great
smooth
and
thin
in
the
mouth
but
definitely
at
least
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
as
well
it
is
a
very
expensive
four
pack
but
a
great
beer
to
share
with
family
and
friends
at
holiday
time
definitely
more
of
a
winter
stout
for
me
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
american
stout
it
had
a
pretty
good
flavor
there
was
some
nice
complexity
and
even
though
i
couldnt
find
the
difference
between
chicory
and
coffee
it
was
still
a
nice
flavor
that
worked
well
with
this
beer
and
it
helped
balance
out
the
heavily
roasted
malts
i
find
this
beer
to
have
pretty
good
drinkability
if
i
had
another
one
i
would
drink
it
i
could
probably
drink
two
or
three
of
these
in
a
sitting
without
a
problem
which
is
pretty
good
for
an
american
stout
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
pretty
much
everything
there
wasnt
anything
that
i
felt
was
out
of
place
or
that
could
be
improved
on
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
that
it
comes
in
four
packs
this
has
six
pack
beer
written
all
over
it
but
at
least
dogfish
head
didnt
put
it
in
a
750ml
bottle
that
would
suck
i
will
for
sure
be
picking
up
a
four
pack
of
this
before
they
are
all
gone
it
makes
for
a
good
tasting
and
easy
drinking
american
stout
i
recommend
this
if
your
a
fan
of
american
stouts
or
coffee
flavored
beers
this
will
hit
the
spot
dogfish
head
did
a
great
job
with
this
beer
i
just
assumed
this
would
be
a
big
beer
so
i
was
surprised
to
this
was
only
5
2
but
it
still
had
big
beer
flavors
the
more
beers
i
try
from
dogfish
head
the
more
they
impress
me
their
crew
really
knows
what
they
are
doing
when
it
comes
to
making
good
tasting
and
unique
beers
o
pretty
good
stout
but
i
would
have
to
says
that
it
does
not
rank
as
high
as
others
i
have
tried
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
great
drinking
beer
but
i
feel
it
could
be
better
i
understand
there
has
been
some
concern
about
the
new
4pack
modality
of
distribution
my
bottle
shop
informed
me
that
the
overall
case
price
is
the
exact
same
as
last
year
and
thus
the
4pack
was
prorated
if
stores
are
charging
the
same
amount
its
not
an
edict
from
the
breweryits
the
shop
or
the
distributor
m
some
decent
carbonation
for
a
stout
smoky
roasty
mediumbodied
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
it
has
a
fantastic
lingering
taste
and
feel
as
with
many
dogfish
beers
this
was
worth
a
try
there
are
other
more
widely
available
examples
of
the
style
which
id
prefer
dr
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
but
the
mouthfeel
is
off
its
of
pretty
good
quality
but
dogfish
head
might
a
lesson
on
how
stouts
are
done
the
price
could
be
better
as
well
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
a
little
disappointing
considering
the
powerful
and
intriguing
nose
the
coffee
bean
tastes
dominates
here
as
a
coffee
lover
i
dont
mind
at
all
but
its
a
bit
too
astringent
for
my
liking
there
is
a
nice
woodsmoked
flavor
im
guessing
thats
what
they
were
trying
to
do
with
the
chicory
but
it
comes
out
with
too
much
of
a
charcoal
effect
the
pros
it
is
quite
a
drinkable
stout
a
session
stout
that
has
average
carbonation
and
a
quick
finish
a
solid
but
not
outstanding
beer
into
a
dfh
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
a
tan
head
that
hangs
out
to
at
least
a
minimum
a
sweet
dark
chocolate
vanilla
cream
roasted
nut
malt
nose
a
robust
yet
crisp
roasted
malt
body
accented
by
a
consistent
nutty
coffee
lightly
sour
and
creamy
taste
on
the
palate
mild
echoing
smokey
note
in
the
finish
kind
of
thin
for
a
stout
very
drinkable
though
mediumthin
bodied
for
a
stout
with
good
carbonation
and
a
fairly
short
snappy
finish
very
drinkable
nice
to
have
something
on
the
lower
abv
side
for
a
change
had
this
one
in
the
late
afternoon
with
a
light
snack
and
could
still
drive
my
car
afterwards
others
i
drank
with
this
found
it
to
be
sort
of
middle
of
the
road
and
forgettable
but
i
quite
enjoyed
it
not
to
beat
a
dead
horse
but
its
lovely
to
have
an
easy
drinking
stout
thats
not
an
overthetop
booze
monster
once
in
a
while
gave
it
2nd
chance
and
glad
i
did
delicious
nearly
jet
black
one
finger
of
tan
head
light
lace
smell
is
full
of
coffee
roasted
malt
bittersweet
notes
fairly
big
hop
profile
behind
all
the
coffee
and
roast
leaving
some
pine
and
citrus
taste
is
roasted
with
lots
of
coffee
molasses
chocolatey
points
light
sourness
comes
and
goes
mild
hop
bite
high
carbonation
creamy
with
some
thin
points
quite
a
nice
stout
nothing
outstanding
but
something
worth
revisiting
again
i
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
but
it
will
be
a
while
before
i
revisit
this
one
yummy
beer
some
real
interesting
tastes
to
it
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
odd
to
me
but
overall
its
not
bad
at
all
o
very
good
stout
right
up
there
with
obsidian
and
bells
double
cream
give
it
a
try
o
this
is
definitely
a
nice
changeup
from
the
heavier
more
intensely
flavored
stouts
ive
been
drinking
but
the
chicory
and
coffee
is
really
prominent
definitely
something
someone
who
dislikes
coffee
wont
like
overall
a
cool
idea
but
there
isnt
much
flavor
o
not
my
favourite
dogfish
head
nor
anywhere
near
my
favourite
stout
but
still
an
above
average
beer
id
have
another
if
not
anytime
soon
interesting
and
idiosyncratic
tentatively
recommended
this
is
a
nice
twist
on
a
coffee
stout
i
like
how
the
wood
and
earthy
qualities
have
a
dominant
factor
it
reminds
me
of
camping
i
really
liked
this
one
i
liked
the
idea
behind
this
beer
but
overall
i
think
it
lacked
something
the
coffee
tones
were
a
nice
touch
as
you
might
expect
in
your
stout
the
drawback
however
was
in
the
harshness
even
served
at
around
60
degrees
the
alcohol
bit
into
the
cheeks
and
overwhelmed
the
hints
of
what
could
have
been
i
still
like
the
beer
and
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
some
day
but
there
are
some
stronger
competitors
out
there
another
detail
i
might
mention
is
the
smell
unique
ill
grant
it
that
but
still
abrasive
and
like
the
taste
only
hinting
at
the
great
idea
the
spawned
the
beast
middle
of
the
pack
for
dogfish
head
from
whom
ive
come
to
expect
both
the
best
and
the
worst
o
really
didnt
enjoy
that
much
there
is
a
funky
taste
in
this
one
that
i
didnt
love
o
the
flavors
on
this
beer
are
light
and
very
satisfying
while
still
being
somewhat
complex
and
interesting
the
low
abv
make
it
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
a
few
and
the
creamy
mouthfeel
almost
make
it
seem
like
a
coffee
milkshake
not
a
bad
brew
o
im
very
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
of
this
brew
disappointing
at
312oz
theres
no
hop
whatsoever
no
bitterness
and
overly
sweet
not
recommended
over
all
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
it
would
lend
its
self
very
nicely
to
an
out
door
sporting
event
in
the
colder
months
o
while
i
cant
say
i
notice
a
remarkable
difference
with
the
roasted
chicory
and
organic
mexican
coffee
i
can
say
that
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
to
me
the
carbonation
level
was
a
bit
too
high
and
at
times
just
made
the
beer
seem
more
porter
like
other
than
that
it
didnt
wow
me
but
its
pretty
good
and
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
sometime
in
the
future
cheers
straightforward
but
done
very
well
the
low
abv
and
notsosweet
taste
make
this
brew
an
easydrinking
goto
stout
o
overall
this
was
a
good
enough
stout
just
not
really
dfh
tier
though
nice
trying
it
but
you
can
find
better
american
stouts
out
there
pours
out
nighblack
until
held
closely
to
a
light
source
than
it
gets
some
dark
brown
highlights
around
the
edges
single
finger
of
tan
colored
head
dissipates
into
a
thin
fizzy
membrane
on
the
surface
of
the
brew
in
about
two
minutes
very
nice
bubbly
carbonation
in
spite
of
this
however
and
a
lovely
silky
medium
thick
body
aroma
is
strong
with
chicory
licorice
at
first
but
this
element
fades
out
gradually
over
time
compared
to
the
other
aspects
as
the
brew
warms
up
as
it
warms
it
develops
much
more
of
a
roasted
element
alongside
a
strange
coconut
bitter
spiced
chocolate
candy
odor
i
taste
some
nice
roasted
chocolate
at
first
which
resolves
into
a
black
coffee
which
is
significantly
milder
in
harshness
than
the
black
coffee
notes
i
typically
get
from
stouts
perhaps
it
is
the
chicory
acting
as
a
tempering
agent
there
is
definitely
a
herbal
earthen
hopping
accent
and
the
oddball
coconut
aroma
is
missing
from
the
flavor
strange
yet
satisfying
very
full
of
flavor
for
the
low
abv
i
like
it
comes
across
as
almost
a
sort
of
holiday
spiced
stout
o
i
have
had
quite
a
few
coffee
stouts
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
extremely
well
balanced
overall
very
smooth
good
flavor
combinations
gimme
another
this
is
a
very
average
offering
for
an
american
stout
there
are
some
good
qualities
here
and
i
think
the
woodiness
adds
an
interesting
layer
of
dimension
but
overall
this
is
just
an
okay
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
its
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
go
to
seasonal
stouts
alcohol
content
is
low
enough
to
have
a
few
in
a
night
no
problem
stands
out
amongst
coffee
stouts
due
to
the
somewhat
unusual
ingredients
st
johns
wort
and
licorice
anyone
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
another
solid
choice
from
dfh
o
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
ill
tell
you
this
add
a
bunch
more
coffee
and
this
would
be
even
better
good
brew
at
any
rate
t
slight
chocolate
sweetness
upfront
followed
by
chicory
roasted
malt
and
espresso
light
mouthfeel
but
the
flavor
held
really
well
full
bodied
smooth
and
really
delicious
overall
a
decent
easy
drinker
with
nice
flavors
o
pretty
nice
not
dfhs
best
stout
but
i
like
the
smokychicory
woodiness
pretty
nice
chicory
stout
pours
black
with
a
halfinch
light
tan
head
which
breaks
up
leaving
a
black
face
thats
frosted
with
tan
throughout
my
pour
there
is
a
nice
ring
with
some
great
looking
lacing
smell
is
some
roasted
dark
malts
up
front
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
faint
coffee
this
first
hits
similar
to
a
sweet
milk
stout
with
the
coffee
flavor
notes
subtle
and
sneaky
its
great
that
this
is
not
overdone
pretty
smooth
all
around
with
a
light
aftertaste
much
lighter
than
i
expected
no
alcohol
noticeable
and
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
end
its
a
classy
brew
for
sure
a
complex
coffee
blend
in
a
stout
that
you
could
session
it
up
with
yeah
i
said
it
dogfish
head
getting
the
holiday
season
started
with
a
solid
banger
overall
a
great
beer
from
dfh
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
definitely
give
it
a
try
beer
is
nice
medium
in
body
good
malt
sweetness
the
backend
of
the
beer
is
nice
not
ashy
or
too
bitter
finishes
without
being
too
dry
a
nice
little
stout
very
fun
i
wont
have
a
problem
drinking
the
other
3
i
bought
today
overall
this
bastard
of
a
brew
is
unique
and
dfh
really
differentiates
themselves
against
other
stouts
with
this
here
beer
great
offthewall
flavor
combination
of
highly
untraditional
ingredients
this
is
the
last
seasonal
dfh
that
ive
tried
and
ive
had
all
but
23
of
them
that
they
will
brew
this
year
as
with
everything
they
do
i
think
they
almost
created
their
own
style
here
o
a
decent
stout
but
not
something
i
would
go
back
to
the
over
roastedness
isnt
a
flavor
i
find
appealing
d
this
drinks
quite
nicely
very
session
able
o
if
you
like
coffee
and
chicory
youll
probably
like
this
im
not
the
biggest
a
fan
of
either
overall
i
truly
like
the
what
dogfish
head
brought
to
the
table
with
chicory
stout
only
issue
it
might
carry
with
it
is
probably
wanting
to
keep
drinking
more
because
it
leaves
your
mouth
and
nose
so
quickly
overall
a
very
decent
american
stout
from
dfh
im
glad
i
got
this
and
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
good
for
parties
or
gettogethers
when
you
want
a
lower
abv
brew
with
plenty
of
flavour
pours
black
with
a
beautiful
creamy
mochacolored
head
that
settles
to
a
thick
soapy
haze
nice
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
cocoa
and
some
sweet
cream
taste
follows
the
nose
nicely
mostly
getting
coffee
and
chocolate
in
a
lovely
mocha
way
hops
still
have
a
bit
of
a
presence
surprising
since
the
bottle
is
older
really
well
balanced
and
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
moderately
creamy
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
mediumlow
carbonation
overall
a
great
everyday
stout
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
nice
dark
black
color
the
head
is
thick
and
tan
in
color
the
lacing
is
pretty
nice
on
this
brew
and
the
retention
is
also
nice
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
light
spiciness
to
it
mixed
with
a
chocolaty
roasted
malt
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
semisweet
upfront
with
a
nice
herbal
roasted
aftertaste
with
just
a
hint
of
some
kind
of
spice
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
has
a
good
thickness
to
it
as
well
as
a
good
carbonation
overall
this
brew
is
nicely
done
pretty
good
stuff
deep
black
into
the
tulip
glass
with
foamy
khaki
head
smells
of
dark
fruits
maple
syrup
coffee
and
roasted
malt
the
chicory
is
also
noticeable
but
blends
very
well
with
the
other
fruity
scents
taste
is
milder
than
expected
roasted
chicory
and
malt
faint
date
and
raisin
and
a
touch
of
coffee
in
the
rear
mouth
is
rather
thin
for
a
stout
being
cut
by
the
carbonation
really
reminds
me
more
of
a
milder
porter
than
a
stout
but
not
bad
by
any
means
odecent
but
not
outstanding
effort
i
could
live
without
the
sour
note
o
pretty
great
as
most
dogfish
are
nice
stout
which
was
a
surprise
from
dogfish
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
nut
brown
highlights
and
a
thin
bubbly
head
slight
coffee
aroma
with
a
very
dark
sweetness
to
it
the
beer
initially
has
a
sharp
licorice
sweet
flavor
all
over
the
tongue
with
a
slight
smokiness
underlying
it
all
very
smooth
and
creamy
in
mouth
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
with
a
cherrylike
character
and
a
sweet
semilingering
finish
great
body
to
help
balance
the
unique
and
interesting
flavors
a
nice
beer
its
not
crazy
overly
exciting
or
particularly
fullflavoured
but
its
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
moderate
abv
stout
overall
the
beer
is
good
fare
but
not
quite
up
to
dogfish
heads
usual
quality
here
the
beer
seems
outofbalance
with
itself
devoting
too
much
attention
to
the
fancy
added
flavors
to
the
unfortunate
detriment
of
regular
stout
flavors
with
as
much
coffee
and
chicory
as
is
present
here
i
would
have
expected
at
least
half
again
the
malt
backing
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
head
smells
of
coffee
malts
and
smoky
wood
heavy
beer
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
coffee
an
earthy
wood
or
bark
tinge
and
some
hops
and
malts
it
finishes
dry
with
little
sweetness
almost
bitter
its
complex
and
wellmade
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
dry
for
my
tastes
ive
always
thought
of
the
chicory
stout
as
a
weaker
stout
but
given
some
age
it
rounds
out
pretty
nice
if
youve
got
some
age
it
a
year
check
in
and
see
how
much
better
it
is
then
you
know
i
dont
hate
it
but
it
is
certainly
not
a
great
beer
straight
up
down
the
road
it
may
be
a
little
closer
to
an
american
porter
for
me
it
has
such
an
ashen
taste
and
aroma
that
the
stout
classification
throws
me
off
a
little
bitand
the
burning
grains
dont
meld
with
the
lighter
body
drinkable
yep
delectable
nope
it
has
an
above
average
mouthfeel
that
ends
in
a
dry
feint
of
sugary
malt
i
do
enjoy
drinking
this
usually
after
several
of
dfhs
more
hoppy
offerings
a
real
dependable
brew
to
say
the
least
as
i
sip
this
beer
it
seems
to
be
all
over
the
place
one
time
it
tastes
great
the
next
it
seems
a
little
funny
i
will
certainly
have
to
try
it
again
a
smooth
and
balanced
stout
with
plenty
of
character
this
ones
a
winner
o
this
wasnt
my
favorite
beer
fresh
and
i
dont
think
8
months
of
age
has
really
done
anything
for
this
beer
im
a
huge
dogfish
head
fan
but
i
think
this
is
my
least
favorite
offering
not
sure
if
ill
be
tempted
to
pick
any
up
next
winter
when
its
bumped
down
to
the
four
packs
still
a
decent
stout
with
an
interesting
twist
that
is
worth
a
try
o
i
think
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
is
nice
to
find
in
a
stout
but
the
flavors
do
suffer
due
to
this
d
smooth
and
creamy
o
a
great
coffee
stout
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
certainly
an
off
center
beer
but
not
anything
at
all
to
get
excited
about
dogfish
head
is
an
odd
brewery
who
makes
some
great
beers
and
some
just
plain
bad
ones
this
one
is
just
pretty
average
if
you
dont
like
some
of
the
fruity
flavors
or
the
coffee
hints
this
one
is
a
strongly
recommended
pass
if
youre
into
those
things
you
might
give
it
a
shot
but
anyone
on
a
budget
there
are
so
many
better
beers
poured
a
black
opaque
color
looks
like
used
motor
oil
as
it
rolls
from
the
bottle
to
the
glass
a
thick
beigecaramel
head
about
two
inches
high
forms
on
top
the
head
then
dissolves
away
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
chocolate
and
coffee
fragrances
strike
the
nose
at
first
scent
followed
by
a
sugar
syrup
scent
and
ending
with
a
twang
of
licorice
the
malt
comes
out
at
the
front
of
each
taste
with
the
expected
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
then
the
flavor
just
seems
to
fade
away
a
slight
touch
of
burnt
bitterness
but
nothing
comes
forward
to
stand
out
the
feel
is
a
big
disappointment
it
starts
across
the
palate
like
a
heavy
water
and
it
thins
out
very
quickly
this
beer
started
out
great
beautiful
color
and
thick
look
a
solid
and
fragrant
aroma
then
it
all
went
to
hell
the
flavors
were
there
but
it
never
brought
any
strength
with
and
faded
way
too
quickly
the
feel
left
me
in
a
wtf
mode
for
some
time
this
was
a
big
let
down
of
a
beer
from
a
brewer
that
i
usually
enjoy
beers
from
poured
opaque
black
with
a
tan
head
roasted
malts
and
overroasted
coffee
to
the
nose
malty
and
roasted
coffee
beans
chicory
to
the
tongue
with
some
semisweet
chocolate
notes
medium
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
with
some
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
but
not
too
memorable
maybe
just
too
big
on
the
roast
and
not
quite
as
smooth
as
i
prefer
for
the
style
o
nice
coffee
stout
that
is
a
wee
bit
different
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
with
carbonation
being
low
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
one
of
my
favorite
dogfish
seasonals
it
somehow
manages
to
be
smooth
and
relatively
easy
drinking
even
with
all
the
roasty
bitter
flavors
a
very
solid
beer
overall
do
very
crisp
and
bubbly
for
a
stout
good
weight
and
fabulously
interesting
flavor
this
beer
is
amazing
d
great
tasting
stout
just
enough
of
roastcoffeesweetness
to
all
worth
nicely
in
the
nosepalate
the
creamy
body
helps
all
this
facets
as
well
overall
a
solid
stout
nice
nutty
flavor
gives
it
some
character
i
enjoy
most
of
dogfish
heads
products
there
brown
ale
is
my
favorite
beer
they
make
the
stout
at
hand
has
an
excellent
distinct
smell
to
it
almost
like
like
a
spice
wood
the
taste
resembling
the
same
from
experience
i
can
say
chicory
stout
goes
well
with
steak
witch
cant
be
beat
thing
is
i
like
it
a
lot
but
i
dont
think
its
a
perfect
beer
if
you
like
stouts
and
chicory
go
for
it
but
be
aware
the
texture
and
body
remind
me
more
of
a
porter
o
good
stout
nothing
too
amazing
however
probably
would
only
drink
1
of
these
at
a
time
o
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
a
little
thin
and
the
coffeechicory
combination
isnt
my
favorite
i
can
see
how
some
people
might
really
like
it
but
its
not
really
for
me
o
an
interesting
stout
from
dfh
did
not
know
what
to
expect
of
this
one
but
i
enjoyed
it
i
would
try
this
again
drinks
well
its
a
nice
beer
that
has
its
applications
to
be
sure
i
like
that
so
much
flavor
can
be
gleaned
from
such
a
low
abv
beer
easy
drinking
and
big
all
at
once
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
but
what
i
got
was
a
pretty
average
stout
with
a
novel
flavor
that
works
offset
by
some
off
flavors
that
dont
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
neither
my
favorite
dogfish
head
offering
nor
my
favorite
stout
by
any
means
that
said
its
still
worth
a
try
o
let
the
beer
warm
and
still
got
a
very
one
dimensional
beer
with
weak
flavors
very
good
another
solid
brew
from
the
great
dgfh
not
the
best
stout
probably
but
a
goodshining
example
d
this
is
an
evenly
brewed
stout
easy
on
the
palate
good
mix
of
flavors
going
on
seems
to
me
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
give
to
someone
who
was
venturing
into
the
stout
arena
while
i
was
not
exactly
a
fan
of
the
finish
on
this
beer
it
did
make
me
want
to
keep
taking
another
sip
nonetheless
the
less
intense
elements
added
to
the
drinkability
and
i
would
certainly
buy
again
typically
i
would
drink
one
stout
and
be
good
this
is
a
stout
i
could
drink
two
and
enjoy
poured
dark
with
a
dark
tan
twofinger
head
smell
was
sweet
with
cocoa
and
coffee
and
molasses
taste
was
at
first
astringent
in
a
black
coffee
sort
of
way
sweet
like
walnuts
bur
overriding
flavor
is
coffee
bitter
like
readskin
peanuts
medium
texture
and
body
medium
carbonation
oily
and
slippery
smooth
finish
was
with
lingering
bitterness
an
excellent
beer
refreshing
and
bracing
d
drinkable
stout
tasty
and
abv
is
only
5
2
d
drinkable
but
not
a
standout
will
i
have
it
again
sure
but
only
because
i
have
the
rest
of
the
6
pack
i
contend
that
this
is
more
porter
like
than
stout
but
it
has
good
roasty
flavors
and
goes
down
easily
dogfish
knows
their
way
around
roast
on
tap
last
night
at
51
lincoln
in
newton
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
brown
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
lacing
all
over
the
glass
smell
was
musty
smoky
and
reminded
me
of
roasted
chestnuts
flavor
was
dark
and
smooth
bitter
chocolate
bark
coffee
and
molasses
were
some
of
the
great
flavor
that
struck
me
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
for
a
stout
but
it
didnt
hinder
the
drinkability
quite
quaffable
with
a
manageable
abv
paired
nicely
with
a
dozen
oysters
and
a
cheese
plate
a
delicious
dinner
the
taste
follows
the
nose
my
immediate
thought
is
that
there
is
basically
no
sweetness
to
this
beer
at
all
the
taste
is
mostly
bitter
and
slightly
sour
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
coffee
without
tasting
strongly
of
coffee
although
it
is
in
there
this
is
not
heavy
and
somewhat
carbonated
and
it
seems
to
be
highly
drinkable
drinkability
easy
to
drink
albeit
thin
i
found
it
somewhat
one
dimensional
and
disappointing
needs
something
else
enjoyed
this
at
one
for
the
road
near
pittsburgh
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
didnt
last
long
but
i
am
one
of
those
who
thinks
the
head
is
purely
for
show
so
i
wont
hold
that
against
it
this
is
an
easy
drinker
for
a
stout
and
based
on
appearance
the
overall
effect
is
unexpected
even
folks
who
dont
typically
like
stout
can
enjoy
this
one
nice
silky
mouthfeel
with
prominent
tastes
of
coffee
slightly
nutty
and
slightly
sweet
had
a
few
pints
of
espresso
randalled
chicory
at
the
fairfax
alehouse
today
color
is
pitch
black
with
a
light
brown
head
doesnt
stick
around
long
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
aromas
are
nice
on
this
one
coffee
coffee
coffee
subtle
roasted
grain
and
chocolate
notes
waft
beneath
the
espresso
rush
taste
is
superb
rich
and
roasty
lots
of
coffee
but
still
maintains
balance
ive
always
loved
chicory
for
the
clean
bitter
finish
and
big
malty
front
solid
randall
night
at
dfh
this
is
another
dogfish
head
beer
that
is
interesting
but
i
dont
love
to
be
fair
i
assumed
i
was
about
to
encounter
a
stout
brewed
with
chicory
which
i
got
what
i
didnt
expect
was
a
stout
brewed
with
whatever
could
be
found
a
round
the
brewers
kitchen
which
i
also
got
d
good
overall
american
stout
but
not
anything
too
exciting
i
would
easily
drink
this
again
d
smooth
as
heck
and
easy
to
down
one
of
my
new
favourite
stouts
given
the
low
abv
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
when
im
in
the
mood
for
more
than
one
stout
overall
a
pretty
fair
brew
thats
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
d
excellent
tasty
but
light
in
alcohol
so
it
goes
down
easily
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
chicory
scoffee
was
evident
in
this
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
roasted
chicory
coffee
semi
sweet
baking
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
very
complex
and
well
balanced
the
warmer
it
got
the
more
the
complex
flavor
changed
not
as
bitter
well
crafted
stout
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
touch
of
brownish
head
burnt
caramel
and
coffee
come
through
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
pleasant
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
almost
like
an
irish
dry
stout
style
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
as
long
as
its
not
too
warm
out
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
d
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
that
i
think
would
go
well
with
a
steak
or
roasted
meat
dish
i
can
also
imagine
washing
down
a
big
bite
of
meatloaf
with
this
one
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
thick
dark
brown
and
nearly
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
aroma
is
very
roasty
freshbrewed
coffee
vanilla
cocoa
and
brown
sugar
flavor
is
smoky
and
roasty
with
notes
of
earthiness
and
bark
fairly
thin
somewhat
lively
carbonation
this
could
be
a
bit
thicker
o
overall
i
love
this
beer
very
creamy
and
rich
has
a
nice
complexity
with
a
smoothness
and
easy
drinking
fashion
that
makes
this
beer
outstanding
i
wish
dogfish
produced
this
year
round
because
i
would
certainly
purchase
it
throughout
the
year
overall
not
a
great
stout
but
still
enjoyable
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
looks
like
black
coffee
with
a
12
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
smelled
like
coffee
and
toffee
up
front
then
catching
mild
alcoholic
and
smokey
scents
some
dark
chocolate
and
toffee
as
well
also
tasted
like
black
coffee
with
acidic
bitter
chocolate
tones
and
some
smokey
aftertaste
it
had
a
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
but
as
i
am
not
a
coffee
drinker
i
would
probably
not
consume
the
entire
6
pack
in
one
night
or
anything
overall
it
was
very
underwhelming
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
from
dfh
for
me
d
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
effort
at
being
ris
like
while
having
a
fairly
light
abv
all
in
all
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
it
had
several
of
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
a
stout
the
mouthfeel
could
have
been
thicker
and
the
flavor
a
bit
richer
but
thats
about
it
very
good
considering
how
light
the
abv
is
body
is
pretty
fluid
reminds
me
a
lot
of
rogues
shakespeare
stout
nice
brew
but
id
like
it
better
if
the
body
and
taste
were
emboldened
a
bit
overall
this
is
actually
a
dfh
beer
i
can
get
behind
i
usually
font
care
for
dfh
but
try
their
products
when
a
new
one
comes
my
way
ill
probably
get
this
one
again
overall
not
bad
i
wouldnt
say
its
bad
in
anyway
just
not
flawless
whos
is
overall
just
didnt
enjoy
this
one
very
much
its
not
bad
but
there
isnt
much
aroma
or
flavor
to
it
better
than
a
bmc
but
not
by
much
love
dfh
but
this
one
is
a
miss
for
me
not
avail
in
tx
so
shipped
back
from
indy
trip
rotation
one
is
enough
nn
very
good
beer
i
could
probably
only
drink
one
in
a
session
m
thin
bodied
creamy
yet
a
little
watery
the
mouthfeel
feels
just
a
bit
too
watery
for
the
style
and
the
carbonation
feels
a
little
high
it
never
meshes
quite
right
with
the
bitterness
of
the
brew
however
it
is
very
drinkable
for
having
such
bold
flavors
a
great
beer
from
dogfish
and
one
that
ill
surely
get
a
sixer
of
next
season
something
to
look
forward
to
d
its
very
drinkable
due
to
the
low
abv
and
lighter
mouthfeel
d
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
coffee
stouts
and
this
is
a
nice
take
the
flavour
mix
is
rich
and
goes
down
smooth
worth
indulging
in
again
d
drinkability
is
moderate
smell
and
taste
are
both
a
tad
on
the
mild
side
while
the
mouthfeel
just
feels
a
bit
thin
especially
given
this
is
a
winter
seasonal
i
would
think
dfh
would
put
out
a
chewier
stout
but
i
could
see
this
beer
being
an
easy
drinker
in
the
summer
d
this
is
a
good
session
stout
there
are
no
areas
where
i
can
knock
it
but
it
could
be
more
memorable
just
a
little
bit
above
average
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
spices
coffee
and
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malt
spices
subtle
coffee
and
spicy
chocolate
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
it
was
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
the
mouthfeel
than
i
like
my
stouts
but
still
not
terrible
this
was
a
pretty
unique
stout
with
the
spicy
chocolate
aspect
to
it
this
one
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
to
get
your
opinion
on
it
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
medium
offwhitetan
had
that
diminishes
quickly
scent
is
chocolatey
and
a
bit
roasty
i
get
some
mellow
coffee
aromas
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
earthiness
taste
is
very
earthy
at
first
then
follows
with
bitter
chocolate
and
some
light
coffee
flavors
finishes
with
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
oats
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
fluffy
a
bit
watery
but
not
too
watery
the
fluffiness
of
this
stout
makes
up
for
it
awesome
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
high
as
it
is
a
stout
you
could
definitely
session
d
good
quality
stout
with
very
smooth
and
warm
flavors
though
a
little
less
than
what
i
expect
from
dogfish
head
they
normally
have
more
deep
flavors
at
play
still
a
good
stout
though
would
recomend
this
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
into
my
dfh
signature
glass
with
about
an
inch
of
tan
head
that
fades
into
about
a
quarter
inch
smells
like
freshly
brewed
pot
of
coffee
awesome
as
it
warms
some
chocolate
comes
through
as
well
taste
is
mostly
a
nice
rich
coffee
flavor
some
cocoa
and
vanilla
in
there
as
well
finishes
nicely
a
little
dry
with
some
roastiness
lingering
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
and
really
the
only
area
this
beer
doesnt
excel
in
very
drinkable
especially
with
breakfast
on
the
weekend
if
i
knew
exactly
what
chicory
tasted
like
i
might
understand
it
more
but
either
way
this
is
a
winner
as
im
sure
you
can
tell
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
this
is
right
now
neck
and
neck
with
dogfish
heads
other
beer
called
miles
davis
bitches
brew
my
local
beer
store
here
in
san
diego
is
selling
a
six
pack
for
12
99
and
i
suggest
if
you
see
one
of
these
you
pick
it
up
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
my
favorite
thus
far
other
than
dragons
milk
that
is
which
would
have
to
be
considered
a
hybrid
of
the
style
sort
of
sad
the
taste
didnt
match
the
smell
as
i
had
hoped
it
would
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
1
finger
of
creamy
tan
head
just
a
few
traces
of
lacing
left
behind
great
nose
on
this
stout
lots
of
coffee
chicory
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
are
the
prominent
aromas
not
quite
as
rich
as
the
smell
would
lead
you
to
believe
but
a
nice
roast
and
smokiness
to
the
flavor
especially
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
and
lighter
in
carbonation
some
nice
things
going
on
in
this
lower
abv
stout
from
dfh
d
a
good
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
really
stops
it
for
me
no
alcohol
to
speak
of
which
could
make
this
beer
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
a
night
this
brew
pours
a
dark
cola
colour
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
sporadic
lacing
but
not
much
at
allthe
smell
is
very
strong
and
has
aromas
of
tobaccodark
coffeeoak
and
burnt
woodthe
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
and
i
find
the
most
of
the
aromas
come
through
on
taste
aswell
with
hints
tobaccodark
coffeemochaoakroasted
biscuts
and
finishes
like
a
nice
strong
cappicino
with
that
hint
of
distinctive
bitterness
that
really
rounds
it
out
and
definately
a
drop
that
i
would
revisit
its
really
tasty
and
would
be
even
tastier
on
a
cold
winters
night
instead
of
a
hot
day
like
today
overall
a
very
very
tasty
session
beer
that
reminds
me
of
a
warm
christmas
night
drinkability
being
a
huge
guinness
fan
throughout
college
dogfish
head
nailed
this
stout
and
will
be
looking
to
take
a
6pack
home
for
people
who
cant
enjoy
dogfish
head
in
missouri
i
would
recommend
this
stout
and
is
without
a
doubt
on
my
top
20
list
of
stouts
i
have
had
would
only
drink
one
or
two
of
these
stouts
in
a
day
d
overall
a
tasty
stout
but
i
found
it
a
bit
too
sourbitter
for
my
liking
worth
a
try
for
sure
and
easily
drinkable
but
ive
had
better
nonetheless
a
decent
offering
from
dogfish
and
im
glad
i
was
able
to
take
it
for
a
test
drive
this
stout
pours
black
with
a
moderate
tan
head
and
subtle
garnet
glow
when
held
to
a
light
the
aroma
is
highly
malty
roast
coffee
predominately
with
subtle
chocolate
and
bittersweet
malt
the
flavor
is
very
much
like
the
nose
highly
roasty
and
coffee
flavor
upfront
the
beer
finishes
just
a
bit
dry
and
bittersweet
the
body
is
mediumfull
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
very
flavorful
coffee
stout
that
also
boasts
some
very
high
drinkability
d
very
easy
for
a
stout
quite
drinkable
libation
if
you
were
to
describe
this
beer
to
some
prior
to
sampling
it
might
impress
unfortunately
this
doesnt
carry
into
the
actual
taste
drinkability
not
terribly
complex
but
interesting
enough
to
have
once
or
twice
with
a
group
of
friends
dm
strong
carbonation
tingle
slightly
thick
on
the
pallet
drinks
deep
and
with
great
malt
flavors
overall
not
bad
i
have
had
a
fair
number
of
stouts
imperial
and
otherwise
and
this
one
falls
right
in
the
middle
not
enough
going
on
to
really
make
me
want
more
if
it
were
in
front
of
me
though
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
overall
nice
look
not
as
fantastic
a
taste
it
was
half
its
size
it
would
be
worth
trying
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
though
drink
doesnt
drink
like
a
stout
and
i
am
sure
this
could
be
a
good
gateway
stout
for
people
to
start
with
not
a
bad
beer
just
expected
more
dpretty
average
stout
overall
pretty
well
rounded
would
definitely
try
again
d
delicious
and
drinks
very
easy
came
to
me
with

almost
black
aroma
is
malty
and
stoutlike
with
ncie
hints
of
wood
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
supa
rich
theres
lotsa
vanilla
oak
mint
caramel
and
chicory
with
the
slightest
smokiness
this
is
sugary
sweet
without
being
cloying
feel
is
super
smooth
surprisingly
drinkable
with
all
this
flavor
goin
on
a
nice
well
rounded
brew
in
my
opinion
worthy
of
many
more
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
one
finger
khaki
colored
head
which
gives
way
to
rings
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
a
roasted
malt
backbone
with
a
big
whiff
of
coffee
in
the
middle
balanced
out
with
some
earthy
hops
the
flavor
has
a
coffee
backbone
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
citrus
flavors
come
through
in
the
middle
to
the
end
to
round
out
and
balance
the
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
has
a
nice
big
aroma
and
a
well
balanced
flavor
to
make
you
want
more
the
beer
is
smooth
as
well
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
that
pops
in
the
mouth
lots
of
flavor
packed
into
this
well
balanced
brew
and
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
a
little
watery
it
is
much
more
coffee
flavored
this
time
around
than
i
remember
when
i
had
it
before
out
of
a
bottle
no
complaints
here
ill
have
another
this
is
a
unique
stout
as
it
is
rare
to
find
any
quite
this
floral
yet
roasted
with
coffee
and
generous
malt
all
at
the
same
time
this
is
a
treat
d
very
easy
to
drink
very
nice
balance
of
flavors
chicory
stout
pours
very
dark
almost
black
with
some
ruby
notes
around
the
edges
it
has
a
half
inch
just
creamy
off
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
light
covering
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
great
with
notes
of
roasted
barley
chocolate
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
coffee
the
taste
is
good
but
not
great
with
the
same
coffee
and
chocolate
and
roasty
flavors
has
some
creaminess
as
well
which
is
very
nice
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
but
is
a
bit
light
on
carbonation
this
one
isnt
really
for
me
it
isnt
bad
but
the
flavours
just
dont
hit
the
spot
for
me
interesting
but
interesting
only
carries
a
beer
so
far
d
a
good
stout
but
a
little
disappointing
i
thought
the
taste
was
a
big
step
down
from
the
nose
and
was
just
average
nothing
about
it
really
jumped
out
at
me
not
bad
and
would
give
another
shot
but
not
the
best
pours
brownblack
nice
pillowy
tan
head
with
good
retention
smell
is
pretty
with
a
sweet
spicy
nose
on
a
great
malty
stout
base
taste
is
blander
than
the
smell
ive
had
chicory
before
and
you
can
definitely
detect
the
dry
rootiness
of
it
no
hops
to
speak
of
finish
is
quick
this
beer
almost
cleans
the
palette
very
unique
i
hesitate
to
say
very
good
though
a
different
positive
beer
experience
d
very
interesting
and
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
wasnt
a
special
beer
but
was
very
drinkable
and
well
done
for
the
style
worth
a
shot
dogfish
head
chicory
stout
is
a
solid
tawny
black
ale
with
a
dense
khaki
head
that
thins
to
a
film
and
leaves
excellent
lacing
it
has
a
strong
roasty
herbal
aroma
with
notes
of
coffee
and
chicory
its
pretty
full
bodied
its
a
little
metallic
at
first
and
then
very
chewy
at
the
finish
it
has
chocolate
and
coffee
ice
cream
flavors
perhaps
a
note
of
strawberry
its
well
balanced
the
bitterness
isnt
blatant
but
it
sustains
the
finish
its
creamy
with
a
hint
of
lactose
its
a
solid
stout
thats
found
a
niche
this
was
a
stout
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
not
much
head
when
pour
served
chilled
but
does
not
need
to
be
that
cold
really
dark
brew
the
smell
has
a
strong
coffee
scent
possibly
espresso
this
beer
is
so
dark
it
is
black
also
a
tad
bit
vanilly
with
roasted
malts
average
alcohol
content
roasted
flavor
slightly
hoppy
feel
d
just
missed
this
one
last
season
so
ive
been
waiting
a
year
to
try
it
im
not
disappointed
it
is
quite
tasty
and
very
drinkable
tastes
just
right
for
a
cold
windy
night
to
me
this
comes
across
as
a
stout
that
doesnt
manage
to
pull
it
together
in
any
way
that
makes
it
stand
out
from
any
other
mediocre
stout
on
the
market
the
extra
ingredients
dont
really
offer
anything
positive
or
noteworthy
beyond
what
the
base
already
provides
and
falls
short
either
sounds
like
a
great
recipe
concept
but
lacks
cohesion
and
body
to
follow
it
through
since
i
was
in
the
dark
beer
mood
i
decided
to
have
the
chicory
stout
from
dogfish
at
the
same
location
as
my
last
review
but
it
wasnt
listed
above
really
really
good
perfect
weather
for
it
now
i
might
just
be
becoming
a
dark
beer
fan
now
for
most
of
the
categories
i
will
leave
it
to
others
to
get
into
the
weeds
with
but
i
can
say
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
actually
thought
it
might
be
higher
in
alcohol
than
the
listed
here
on
beeradvocate
but
i
liked
it
a
lot
overall
very
good
at
least
to
my
palate
my
wife
said
it
was
a
bit
bitter
but
not
too
bitter
i
t
was
very
tasty
to
me
though
just
short
of
excellent
nice
head
nice
color
nice
aroma
a
nice
bright
spice
almost
licorice
sort
of
note
on
the
top
of
the
usual
stoutdark
beer
type
of
taste
is
what
i
tasted
i
tend
to
not
review
with
tastes
of
in
my
reviews
since
that
is
very
subjective
to
me
i
almost
never
taste
many
of
the
things
tasters
claim
to
taste
imho
it
is
either
a
nice
tasty
brew
or
not
in
this
case
tasty
this
is
really
only
a
few
steps
up
from
a
yuengling
porter
and
almost
a
staircase
more
expensive
on
tap
upick6
in
erie
pa
pours
black
with
ruby
hues
aroma
of
chocolate
and
burnt
coffee
flavor
of
chocolate
some
burnt
coffee
also
hints
of
smoke
mouth
feel
is
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
not
bad
the
burnt
taste
was
a
little
too
much
by
the
end
of
the
glass
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
better
from
dogfish
head
though
i
just
recently
learned
that
chicory
has
been
used
as
a
cheap
substitute
for
coffee
beans
for
a
good
chunk
of
american
history
which
seems
appropriate
here
as
the
coffee
really
stands
out
over
what
i
have
to
assume
is
the
earthy
woody
character
from
the
chicory
d
great
stout
that
is
easy
drinking
and
abv
extremely
reasonable
still
allowing
for
great
flavor
this
is
an
excellent
beer
ive
just
found
another
reliable
goto
stout
for
any
number
of
drinking
occasions
winner
great
beer
to
have
after
dessert
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
but
a
bit
underwhelming
complexity
is
there
but
the
flavors
dont
mesh
perfectly
well
done
overall
while
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
with
a
high
abv
all
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
unique
it
is
a
highly
enjoyable
beer
that
would
be
a
perfect
complement
to
a
sunday
of
football
i
love
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
for
a
stout
i
have
to
say
when
i
fist
thought
about
coffee
and
beer
together
i
kinda
flinched
this
beer
however
is
very
smokey
with
a
chocolaty
coffee
finish
really
great
for
a
dark
beer
its
a
good
winter
beer
its
occurred
to
me
that
i
dont
know
what
chicory
is
im
guessing
its
the
earthy
smell
i
cant
place
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
what
it
costs
here
in
alberta
i
doubt
ill
be
drinking
it
again
dark
reddishbrown
very
clear
when
held
to
the
light
the
tan
head
quickly
recedes
to
a
collar
smells
light
roasty
with
earthy
coffee
notes
a
bit
bready
watery
on
the
palate
dry
and
very
thin
chalky
mouthfeel
roasty
earthy
flavors
up
front
a
bit
herbal
and
minty
toward
the
finish
with
an
odd
alkaseltzer
note
this
is
thoroughly
unimpressive
db
nice
stout
with
a
good
roast
profile
and
unique
flavor
from
the
chicory
d
very
drinkablehave
not
had
any
dogfish
that
was
not
a
highly
awaited
experience
dfh
beers
are
all
surprising
and
well
received
even
if
you
have
already
had
them
they
still
captivate
the
mouth
and
make
you
notice
the
flavors
d
regardless
of
the
feel
it
was
very
drinkable
smooth
and
pleasing
moderate
abv
i
had
3
d
to
me
dfh
is
pretty
hit
or
miss
this
one
isnt
quite
a
miss
but
its
not
one
of
their
best
or
perhaps
this
one
is
just
not
for
me
do
you
like
chicory
perhaps
you
will
love
it
but
a
traditional
coffee
flavored
stout
this
one
is
not
d
fairly
drinkable
for
the
style
dvery
good
easy
to
enjoy
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
poured
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
dark
brown
head
aroma
was
very
toasty
with
a
hint
of
coffee
and
maybe
some
chocolate
flavor
is
similar
and
you
can
definitely
taste
the
chicory
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavy
for
this
strength
taste
wise
there
was
a
lot
going
on
but
it
just
did
not
seem
to
mesh
into
a
complete
experience
for
me
d
it
was
good
but
i
probably
can
only
drink
one
before
i
move
onto
something
else
pours
black
with
a
tan
foamy
head
notes
of
roasted
malts
in
the
nose
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
chicory
aromas
come
out
as
it
warms
taste
is
smooth
drinking
mild
bitterness
and
coffee
flavour
round
out
the
middle
finished
dry
creamy
midheavy
mouthfeel
great
tasting
and
easy
to
sip
rather
low
abv
for
dfh
which
i
dont
mind
6
pack
should
last
the
season
for
future
cold
winter
nights
pours
black
with
a
twofinger
light
brown
head
average
lacing
and
retention
big
coffee
aroma
roasted
woodsy
notes
as
well
flavor
follows
nice
bitter
roasted
coffee
flavor
up
front
also
a
hint
of
bitter
unsweetened
chocolate
sticky
molases
before
a
very
good
smokey
woodsy
profile
next
you
can
definitely
taste
the
chicory
surprisingly
very
smooth
for
the
big
roasted
flavor
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
a
stout
with
moderate
carbonation
its
an
odd
sensation
to
drink
a
stout
that
is
so
thin
but
it
makes
for
a
highly
drinkable
and
sessionable
stout
perfect
for
a
winters
night
chicory
stout
proves
that
a
coffee
stout
doesnt
have
to
be
a
big
bad
abv
bomb
to
be
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
have
never
tried
chicory
root
but
i
have
to
say
this
beer
has
a
unique
taste
most
likely
because
of
the
chicory
the
beer
is
straight
up
coffee
flavors
so
if
you
dont
like
those
flavors
steer
clear
the
watery
taste
is
my
primary
negative
and
that
wimpy
head
light
and
not
overly
complex
but
quite
balanced
and
very
drinkable
wouldnt
make
a
point
to
seek
it
out
again
but
it
was
definitely
worth
a
try
d
this
is
one
stout
i
could
drink
several
of
which
isnt
typical
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
d
this
is
a
good
stout
but
there
are
so
many
great
stouts
out
there
i
would
not
rush
to
get
this
again

overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
drinkability
it
was
interestingly
light
for
a
stout
which
acted
to
increase
the
ease
of
consumption
this
unfortunately
meant
a
sacrifice
in
other
departments
namely
those
of
taste
and
aroma
which
were
unpleasantly
metallic
additionally
its
lightness
also
acted
against
it
in
that
the
drinker
is
left
wanting
something
more
substantial
drinkability
quite
nice
for
the
winter
months
id
go
find
it
again
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
due
to
the
high
flavor
of
this
beer
id
probably
choose
a
different
stout
for
a
session
dquite
drinkable
for
a
coffee
stout
great
for
monday
night
football
while
it
is
snowing
outside
d
really
good
a
nice
nofrills
coffee
stout
easydrinking
and
tasty
perfect
for
wintertime
football
watching
sessions
and
the
like
d
easy
drinking
stout
not
bad
at
all
for
10
a
sixer
d
would
drink
again
would
not
drink
more
than
one
in
an
evening
overall
a
flavorful
and
pleasant
stout
d
very
drinkable
given
the
fact
that
it
isnt
as
thick
and
heavy
as
most
stouts
could
easily
have
more
than
one
overall
this
an
excellent
winter
brew
the
chicory
and
coffee
it
was
brewed
with
is
evident
its
very
pleasant
to
sip
on
this
brew
while
watching
the
snow
fall
outside
this
is
dogfish
heads
winter
beer
so
i
will
have
to
grab
some
more
of
this
while
i
still
can
highly
recommended
tastes
like
your
usual
stout
with
an
added
fruityish
flavor
that
im
personally
down
with
solid
beer
enjoyable
mouthfeel
and
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
several
of
these
if
i
was
more
of
a
stout
guy
love
the
way
it
looks
and
it
definitely
has
a
lot
to
offer
if
your
a
stout
guy
but
i
do
wish
it
was
a
little
more
robust
than
it
is
i
think
with
little
more
character
itd
be
a
topnotch
stout
d
it
drinks
like
it
has
a
higher
abv
and
for
that
i
like
it
i
was
honestly
expecting
more
from
the
flavor
it
didnt
have
a
lot
of
depth
or
really
that
strong
of
a
flavor
for
me
goes
down
rather
easy
for
me
but
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
glad
i
tried
it
and
appreciate
the
gesture
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
was
hoping
the
chicory
flavors
were
in
the
foreground
on
this
one
but
it
quickly
slid
into
the
unmemorable
lighter
bodied
stout
category
for
me
drinkable
tasty
but
undercarbonated
and
overall
a
lightweight
stout
when
it
comes
to
stoutbattleships
or
sledgehammers
i
aint
looking
for
lightweight
not
as
robust
as
id
want
this
beer
pours
pitch
black
and
oil
like
the
head
is
tan
with
great
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
coffee
chicory
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
of
coffee
and
chocolate
little
hops
roasted
malts
this
medium
bodied
beer
is
smooth
and
dry
overall
not
bad
but
one
is
enough
it
took
me
a
few
mouth
fulls
to
get
any
chicory
taste
its
masked
by
the
roasted
barley
and
coffee
it
makes
itself
apparent
in
the
very
end
i
wish
there
was
more
i
remember
enjoying
the
chicory
stout
i
had
last
winter
more
than
this
but
i
still
very
much
enjoy
it
drinkability
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
is
not
as
high
as
i
would
like
its
good
and
a
bit
different
but
the
mexican
spice
gets
to
me
after
a
bit
probably
could
only
have
one
or
two
at
a
time
overall
this
is
another
interesting
beer
from
dogfish
head
but
i
doubt
i
would
drink
this
again
d
it
is
very
filling
and
at
times
too
sweet
drinking
more
than
two
would
be
a
struggle
not
one
of
my
favourites
from
dfh
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
from
dfh
albeit
a
little
out
there
but
thats
most
of
their
beers
good
flavor
solid
drinkability
and
an
interesting
drink
give
it
a
shot
if
you
see
it
drinkability
is
very
high
could
easily
drink
this
one
all
night
overall
a
very
straightforward
and
not
very
complex
stout
drinkability
is
high
and
i
could
definetely
session
this
one
d
the
first
time
ive
had
this
in
a
few
years
and
its
better
than
i
remembered
this
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
smell
reminds
me
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
along
with
a
hint
of
hickory
smoked
bacon
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
well
balanced
stout
plenty
of
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
balanced
very
well
with
hops
has
an
interesting
taste
from
the
chicory
the
moutfeel
is
thick
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
stout
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
stout
style
d
as
i
said
above
this
is
in
serious
contention
as
my
favorite
americanbrewed
stout
very
drinkable
and
its
a
shame
that
this
is
a
seasonal
release
d
i
think
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
easily
and
quickly
i
could
easily
drink
a
6pack
of
these
this
is
not
my
favorite
stout
by
any
means
but
i
think
it
is
pretty
good
cheers
overall
this
is
a
so
so
beer
its
more
of
a
light
porter
then
stout
not
much
flavor
or
mouthfeel
not
sure
what
the
point
of
this
beer
is
i
expected
bigger
coming
from
dfh
d
it
drank
really
good
for
the
flavor
being
really
rich
and
roastiness
it
did
take
me
back
to
the
cafe
con
leche
days
a
very
drinkable
stout
and
another
great
offering
from
dfh
this
is
a
no
brainer
not
much
else
to
say
not
very
bitter
at
all
its
like
drinking
coffee
but
different
so
its
a
4
5
for
drinkability
wonderful
winter
beer
drinkabililty
heavy
yet
smooth
with
more
than
adequate
touches
of
flavor
it
is
balanced
enough
that
it
could
stand
a
slightly
higher
abv
but
still
a
quality
example
of
the
style
all
the
same
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
kinda
kills
the
experience
on
this
one
as
does
the
aftertaste
probably
the
biggest
flaws
in
the
beer
flavor
is
unique
and
earthy
notes
are
desirable
but
not
likely
to
bjcp
guidelines
drinkability
this
one
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
middle
of
the
pack
at
best
especially
if
judging
this
as
a
coffee
stout
not
terrible
but
i
probably
couldve
done
better
with
my
sixpack
purchase
that
evening
appearance
is
darkness
cant
see
through
it
black
as
night
with
a
nice
creamy
brown
3
finger
head
has
some
light
lacing
around
the
glass
as
the
head
bubbles
away
smells
smokey
chocolatey
and
coffee
from
the
chicory
got
a
wiff
of
earth
at
the
first
nosing
but
cant
pick
it
up
again
licorice
smell
is
pleasant
with
lots
of
different
things
to
pick
up
on
at
each
nosing
tastes
chocolaty
with
slight
bitter
taste
on
the
back
of
the
toungue
there
is
a
floral
or
herb
taste
that
makes
itself
known
on
every
other
drink
rich
and
flavorful
not
as
mealy
or
thick
as
other
stouts
goes
down
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
but
that
may
just
be
my
taste
i
like
carbonated
brews
and
shy
from
porters
which
is
what
this
reminds
me
of
rather
than
a
stout
dogfish
head
lives
up
to
its
reputation
for
providing
me
something
that
i
have
never
tasted
before
and
for
that
i
thank
you
not
my
favorite
stout
but
is
definitely
unique
nice
full
mouthfeel
very
smooth
with
no
harshness
or
much
bitterness
chicory
and
coffee
are
great
complementary
flavors
and
they
work
really
well
in
a
lowalcohol
stout
like
this
im
enjoying
this
but
i
must
confess
that
i
probably
wouldnt
want
to
do
2
bottles
in
a
row
the
flavor
is
nice
but
it
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
nothing
earth
shattering
i
have
no
idea
what
chicory
tastes
like
so
i
cant
comment
on
that
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
making
it
quite
sessionable
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
and
would
definitely
considering
having
one
with
breakfast
dthis
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
ever
im
not
sure
why
that
has
changed
is
the
beer
different
or
have
i
just
exposed
myself
to
much
more
flavorful
stouts
since
i
first
had
this
its
definitely
a
good
go
to
stout
something
ill
get
every
winter
there
are
a
lot
of
other
better
readily
available
stouts
out
there
very
easy
drinking
though
d
nice

of
the
flavors
could
have

of

notes
not
terrible
but
i
personally
did
not
care
much
for
this
beer
too
herbal
and
earthy
and
bitter
in
an
unpleasant
way
it
reminded
me
of
drinking
some
kind
of
holistic
tea
maybe
its
just
the
chicory
that
i
dont
like
at
11
for
a
six
pack
one
could
do
far
better
all
in
all
theres
a
lot
of
room
for
improvement
with
this
brew
it
looks
and
smells
quite
appetizing
but
when
it
comes
down
to
flavor
and
feeling
there
are
a
few
more
steps
that
need
to
be
climbed
honestly
it
just
needs
to
be
a
tad
bit
stronger
in
flavor
and
thicker
in
feeling
but
all
in
all
its
not
a
bad
brew
just
one
still
in
the
making
do
i
didnt
know
what
chicory
was
until
i
looked
it
up
and
even
now
i
dont
know
what
it
is
id
have
to
say
the
drinkability
suffers
a
tad
because
of
the
coffee
taste
to
it
nevertheless
a
pretty
good
brew
from
dfh
very
very
drinkable
d
a
treat
cafe
au
lait
with
a
kick
so
simple
but
so
good
d
dfh
beers
are
always
interesting
and
this
one
is
definitely
offcentered
its
a
decent
stout
but
i
think
i
prefer
some
other
widely
available
offerings
the
flavors
just
a
touch
too
idiosyncratic
for
me
very
pleasing
brew
altogether
could
see
this
accompanying
beef
stew
beef
pies
or
other
hearty
beef
meals
d
very
easy
drinking
stout
and
the
alcohol
is
low
pours
a
black
color
that
is
brown
towards
the
edges
a
beige
creamy
head
that
disipates
into
a
sparse
cap
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
roasty
from
malt
and
coffee
with
dark
chocolate
notes
a
touch
of
wood
and
some
licorice
the
taste
is
of
a
deep
roasted
malt
some
coffee
and
chocolate
there
is
a
hint
of
peat
or
some
wood
the
flavor
tails
off
a
bit
in
the
end
finishes
with
a
lemony
tea
like
taste
the
feel
seems
fairly
light
especially
towards
the
end
for
a
stout
and
has
prickly
carbonation
the
beer
remains
bitter
on
the
palate
throughout
a
very
tasty
stout
for
5
2abv
it
is
well
appreciated
it
is
fairly
light
at
times
but
its
quite
flavorful
this
was
a
good
beer
however
its
not
a
roasted
coffee
beer
if
you
like
southern
chicory
coffee
this
is
your
beer
d
if
you
find
that
you
like
the
chicory
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
beer
the
body
is
nice
and
full
and
the
great
subtle
touch
of
carb
keeps
this
creamy
and
enjoyable
lingering
chocolate
tries
to
persist
but
eventually
gets
washed
out
ends
in
a
mild
touch
of
roast
and
minimal
bitterness
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
stout
im
glad
to
have
finally
enjoyed
one
i
have
not
had
one
of
these
in
about
two
years
and
i
definitely
like
it
more
now
than
way
back
when
this
is
a
quality
stout
that
would
make
a
great
go
to
winter
beer
and
probably
would
make
a
pretty
badass
beer
float
as
well
drinkable
but
not
exactly
cheap
or
super
easy
to
find
in
oh
but
i
could
easily
down
a
couple
pints
with
dinner
a
good
stout
but
doesnt
measure
up
to
the
others
in
the
category
overall
this
is
a
decent
effort
i
dont
think
its
as
bad
as
some
of
the
reviews
it
has
gotten
would
indicate
but
im
still
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
others
worth
a
try
but
probably
a
good
idea
to
avoid
a
six
pack
goes
down
ok
chicory
adds
a
bit
of
smoothness
to
what
would
otherwise
be
a
harsh
astringent
and
bitter
coffee
stout
but
with
the
plethora
of
better
coffee
flavored
stouts
that
have
been
brewed
in
recent
years
this
one
pales
in
comparison
d
this
is
not
one
of
the
great
american
stouts
for
sure
but
i
still
find
myself
ordering
it
from
the
brewpub
again
and
again
and
again
i
guess
that
speaks
volumes
as
to
its
drinkability
huh
d
as
other
reviewers
have
mentioned
as
far
as
dfh
brews
go
this
is
not
a
particularly
memorable
one
though
is
none
the
less
pretty
good
drinkable
yes
memorable
less
so
d
this
was
a
very
drinkable
stout
that
met
mixed
reviews
at
the
table
since
people
werent
expecting
any
adjuncts
i
guess
they
didnt
realize
it
was
a
dogfish
head
beer
sam
and
team
have
done
it
again
making
a
unique
beer
pushing
the
depth
of
stout
boundaries
in
a
different
way
than
the
traditional
coffee
oatmeal
and
regular
spices
overall
this
is
a
nice
low
abv
american
stout
flavors
are
robust
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
the
drinkability
is
high
i
can
see
myself
getting
a
case
of
this
to
have
on
hand
for
brunch
or
nightcaps
throughout
the
winter
chicory
either
complements
the
hops
well
or
makes
up
a
nice
unique
bitterness
on
its
own
for
me
it
doesnt
matter
it
has
a
good
not
too
sweet
chocolate
flavor
with
a
nice
chicory
coffee
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
this
one
grows
on
you
as
you
drink
it
and
the
finish
is
medium
roasted
coffee
that
is
pleasant
although
the
citrus
character
carries
through
to
the
finish
this
one
may
be
good
and
may
be
enhanced
with
food
d
its
decent
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
its
not
remarkable
just
kind
of
plain
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
that
stands
out
either
overall
i
was
disappointed
with
this
release
it
tastes
watered
down
and
the
flavors
are
not
well
balanced
unfortunately
the
appearance
and
smell
set
the
bar
high
and
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
fail
to
deliver
this
was
a
mainstay
in
the
fridge
last
winter
i
doesnt
look
to
be
this
year
12oz
bottle
with
a
bottle
on
date
of
100710
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
very
little
head
very
little
lacing
aromas
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
coffee
and
some
molasses
this
beer
has
a
great
coffee
taste
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
flavors
as
well
this
is
a
damn
fine
stout
with
a
really
good
coffee
taste
the
lower
abv
makes
it
a
brew
you
can
easily
drink
a
few
of
i
like
a
lot
of
dfh
beers
but
this
isnt
one
of
the
more
impressive
ones
somewhat
dull
and
monotone
in
its
taste
i
wouldnt
reach
for
this
first
d
a
very
easy
drinker
tasty
but
nothing
special
the
taste
is
an
interresting
combination
of
certainly
coffee
with
an
uncharacteristic
bitter
aftertaste
that
must
be
the
chicory
which
is
often
used
a
a
coffee
substitute
i
find
the
taste
interresting
yet
not
my
favorite
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
refreshing
drinkability
therefore
ok
nice
seasonable
approach
to
brew
something
different
d
this
is
flavorful
and
enjoyable
if
you
like
coffee
drinkability
i
found
the
chicory
stout
interesting
at
first
but
the
astringency
is
strong
enough
that
the
complexity
of
all
the
flavors
dont
get
a
great
chance
to
shine
still
an
interesting
spin
on
a
stout
just
below
medium
bodied
the
cola
tingling
carbonation
but
its
the
same
consistency
of
broth
it
would
be
smooth
if
it
wasnt
so
empty
desperately
needs
some
thickness
some
staunch
character
im
not
motivated
to
reach
for
another
my
first
dfh
disappointment
i
purchased
old
school
today
so
the
world
will
be
right
again
with
dfh
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
the
coffee
is
a
little
stronger
than
i
prefer
in
my
stouts
but
the
smoke
made
up
for
it
worth
grabbing
a
bottle
or
pint
if
you
see
it
around
overall
not
my
favorite
but
its
pretty
good
i
dont
know
what
chicory
is
so
i
couldnt
say
what
it
added
to
the
brew
worth
a
try
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
slight
mocha
head
that
faded
fast
the
smell
was
a
nice
rich
malty
chocolatecoffee
but
the
smell
was
not
very
strong
the
taste
started
with
a
smooth
malt
smoky
coffee
flavor
followed
by
a
sweet
chocolate
and
a
coffee
finish
the
aftertaste
has
faint
honey
notes
just
the
taste
not
in
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
a
smooth
beer
with
nice
depth
of
flavor
this
is
a
nice
beer
great
session
beer
not
a
heavy
stout
that
fills
you
up
but
still
has
a
nice
moutfeel
to
it
definitely
worth
a
try
what
a
great
smell
smells
of
chocolate
rich
malts
and
some
coffee
with
some
herb
like
smells
in
the
background
the
taste
is
just
like
this
very
nice
rich
malts
on
the
front
end
ending
sweet
chocolate
in
the
middle
and
the
coffee
chicory
and
hops
all
mix
in
together
for
an
earthy
finish
to
complete
the
beer
wow
and
its
only
5
2
percent
this
is
incredible
finally
a
dogfish
head
beer
that
i
can
enjoy
a
bunch
of
in
one
night
besides
the
60
minute
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
plus
the
taste
make
this
an
a
plus
beer
in
my
mind
i
love
the
ending
herb
like
taste
that
mixes
in
so
well
with
the
coffee
its
so
well
balanced
its
ridiculous
the
body
is
also
pretty
damn
nice
for
it
being
such
a
low
alcohol
beer
if
you
find
this
get
this
and
appreciate
the
balance
of
what
i
can
say
is
my
favorite
stout
to
date
drinkability
is
good
this
is
very
much
a
coffee
beer
d
well
i
only
know
of
one
shop
that
has
it
maybe
two
but
would
definitely
check
out
the
price
of
a
sixer
still
i
still
wonder
what
more
abv
could
do
to
this
beer
nothing
crazy
like
wws
just
maybe
a
bit
more
was
overall
good
overall
a
better
than
average
stout
that
has
a
good
flavor
drinkability
is
above
average
the
beer
is
interesting
if
not
traditional
its
complex
but
light
and
goes
down
easily
it
wouldnt
be
my
choice
for
a
session
beer
but
you
certainly
could
if
you
wanted
to
as
far
as
a
dogfish
head
product
goes
its
not
my
favorite
but
all
in
all
its
not
bad
i
guess
im
just
partial
to
imperial
stouts
however
the
stouts
in
the
8
abv
range
arent
necessarily
imperial
and
i
prefer
them
much
more
than
this
offering
bear
republic
stout
notes
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
interesting
and
well
crafted
on
tap
at
the
gaithersburg
dfh
alehouse
this
beer
may
have
been
helped
by
the
fact
that
i
had
enjoyed
a
glass
of
the
punkin
just
prior
gorgeous
black
with
a
12
inch
dark
tan
head
that
sat
like
a
permanent
fixture
on
top
of
the
glass
and
laced
it
all
the
way
down
slightly
coffeechocolate
roasted
malt
flavor
in
the
nose
and
in
initial
taste
but
the
flavor
soon
expanded
into
a
myriad
of
different
things
that
raced
across
the
tongue
everything
was
therethe
coffee
chocolate
licorice
even
a
hint
of
hops
bitterness
but
definitely
not
hoppy
roasted
and
rich
and
extremely
drinkable
this
one
was
a
keeper
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
beers
with
a
lot
of
extraneous
ingredients
esp
vanilla
in
my
stoutthank
you
dogfish
head
but
the
little
extras
in
this
one
really
set
it
apart
in
a
good
way
im
really
glad
i
tried
it
and
will
look
for
it
in
bottles
though
apparently
only
a
winter
seasonal
pours
a
black
color
34
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
dry
hops
slight
alcohol
and
wood
fits
the
style
of
an
american
stout
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
noticeable
dryness
tastes
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
hint
of
hops
hint
of
coffee
hint
of
spice
and
a
hint
of
wood
overall
a
good
aroma
appearance
body
blend
and
complexity
the
flavor
is
nice
and
this
is
actually
one
of
the
more
sessionable
stouts
ive
had
to
date
but
it
falls
short
of
greatness
could
definitely
polish
off
a
few
though
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
a
very
good
stout
for
the
price
and
not
that
hard
to
come
by
fresh
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
melts
slowly
and
leaves
rings
of
tan
lace
on
the
glass
dark
fudge
coffee
anise
and
a
slight
herbal
note
in
the
aroma
roasty
coffee
and
cocoa
flavors
with
something
else
must
be
chicory
slightly
earthy
tasting
on
the
leaner
side
of
medium
bodied
for
a
stout
with
smooth
carbonation
a
decent
stout
nothing
makes
me
want
to
go
back
to
the
fridge
and
grab
another
bottle
but
i
did
drain
the
nonic
easily
the
grittiness
on
the
front
of
the
palate
eventually
builds
up
on
the
lips
however
scoop
some
coffee
ice
cream
in
this
and
you
might
be
transported
to
the
big
easy
in
a
beer
float
they
should
have
a
beer
float
in
the
mardi
gras
parade
drinkability
is
good
but
its
not
a
chugger
and
a
something
id
rather
have
inside
while
the
snow
is
falling
outside
but
even
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
was
nice
to
try
this
slightly
complex
stout
all
in
all
a
more
than
solid
lighter
bodied
stout
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
d
very
tasty
i
dont
know
if
i
really
notice
the
chicory
but
its
still
a
damned
nice
stout
d
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
the
coffee
possibly
enhanced
by
the
chicory
comes
across
as
being
overly
harsh
and
leaves
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
wasnt
really
that
pleasant
highly
recommended
tastes
like
coffee
but
again
without
the
warmth
pretty
standard
stout
stuff
otherwise
dry
and
very
full
heavy
in
the
mouth
and
its
like
drinking
a
sandbox
just
lacks
that
sweet
finish
but
it
definitely
is
heavy
otherwise
a
decent
stout
nice
to
drink
but
nothing
really
spectacular
d
this
is
going
to
be
a
big
hit
or
miss
depending
on
your
preferences
i
like
it
its
worth
a
shot
for
sure
one
of
those
beers
that
you
like
but
arent
surprised
if
some
of
your
friends
dont
i
usually
like
two
of
these
per
sitting
but
its
astringency
and
coffecentricity
kind
of
limit
its
drinkability
finally
getting
around
to
trying
this
one
after
passing
it
up
for
too
long
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
a
nice
bit
of
mochacolored
foam
a
very
aromatic
beer
with
dark
roasted
malt
mocha
cappuccino
cocoa
and
heavy
cream
kind
of
light
on
the
palate
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
with
some
roasted
malt
flavors
a
little
coffee
and
some
dark
chocolate
nice
and
creamy
very
nice
d
a
solid
stout
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
no
problem
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
pint
glass
pour
and
i
am
met
with
a
dark
black
brew
with
a
nice
beige
foamy
head
aroma
consists
of
espresso
toffee
dark
chocolate
cocoa
and
roasted
malts
very
roasty
toasty
taste
with
a
slight
black
coffee
bitter
aftertaste
a
little
too
carbonated
for
this
stout
at
only
5
2
multiples
are
easy
and
overall
this
is
worthy
of
more
than
a
single
bottle
in
a
session
overall
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
awhile
and
i
am
happy
with
the
outcome
a
nice
easydrinking
stout
that
stays
true
to
the
style
nicely
done
tastes
good
a
nice
take
on
a
stout
worth
the
try
and
worth
having
around
for
its
roasty
chocolate
and
coffee
balance
not
blow
your
socks
off
unique
but
very
tasty
and
well
crafted
this
is
better
fresh
and
better
in
the
winter
but
not
too
much
was
lost
over
the
7
months
it
was
sitting
d
a
very
hearty
burnt
coffee
beer
this
one
i
will
go
after
again
if
i
am
ever
in
the
mood
for
such
a
brew
all
in
all
very
enjoyable
but
i
felt
like
i
needed
a
breath
mint
when
i
finished
d
great
stout
love
the
addition
of
chicory
da
very
smooth
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
leaves
me
slightly
disappointed
drinkability
is
decent
at
5
2
abv
and
with
a
thinnish
mouthfeel
to
boot
this
is
a
very
lightweight
entry
into
the
world
of
stouts
i
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
after
sampling
such
heavies
as
fbs
and
peche
mortel
the
chicory
stout
doesnt
come
close
to
their
caliber
but
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
great
one
d
overall
a
very
solid
american
stout
with
tons
of
great
dark
coffee
flavor
recommended
if
you
like
your
stouts
well
balanced
and
creamy
not
available
in
my
area
yet
or
else
id
probably
keep
it
in
the
rotation
f
finishes
with
some
dryness
but
not
very
dry
a
slight
lactose
feel
on
the
finish
too
a
nice
smokey
flavor
lingers
for
a
while
leaving
that
smoked
meat
and
bbq
chicory
flavor
slight
bitterness
mostly
from
charred
malts
and
coffee
bean
flavors
a
really
nice
campfire
beer
which
i
will
have
to
remember
next
bbq
mouthfeel
is
a
little
more
carbonated
than
what
youd
expect
from
a
stout
a
little
watery
but
not
unfulfilling
aroma

this
was
the
first
craft
stout
for
me
four
years
ago
and
tonight
was
the
first
attempt
to
rate
it
im
sorry
that
im
attempting
this
with
a
yearold
bottle
as
i
feel
that
is
taking
away
from
my
original
impression
of
this
brew
either
that
or
the
russian
imperial
stouts
ive
had
this
winter
have
altered
my
taste
buds
i
recommend
this
stout
as
a
must
try
to
all
stout
fans
d
very
smooth
very
easy
drink
and
a
potential
session
beer
even
though
it
is
slightly
higher
than
5
abv
good
overall
stout
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
black
with
a
tan
head
no
idea
where
they
got
bone
from
as
said
on
the
bottle
whatever
smells
of
coffee
and
chocolate
tastes
like
coffee
with
a
bite
of
chicory
coming
in
near
the
end
very
pleasant
all
around
from
dfh
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
on
the
regular
pours
a
medium
to
dark
brown
color
one
of
the
lightest
colored
stouts
out
there
with
decent
khaki
colored
head
and
decent
retention
smell
is
of
nuts
coffee
chicory
with
faint
earthy
hops
taste
is
slightly
sweeter
than
nose
dictated
but
containts
the
nice
blend
of
nuts
coffee
and
chicory
found
in
the
scent
hops
are
there
earth
wood
as
well
as
a
faint
aniselicorice
like
taste
medium
body
slightly
high
in
carbonation
little
bitter
and
earthy
aftertaste
nice
stout
good
break
from
the
big
bold
ones
most
common
now
well
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
before
and
i
truly
enjoy
it
it
pours
a
very
dark
amber
which
has
a
nice
red
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
its
got
a
small
but
solid
creamy
caramel
head
with
a
pleasant
aroma
from
the
roasted
chicory
and
mexican
coffee
the
taste
is
very
pleasant
with
caramel
coffee
and
chicory
tones
it
goes
down
smooth
leaving
your
mouth
feeling
crisp
and
awaiting
another
sip
this
beer
is
on
the
dark
end
of
the
spectrum
and
can
only
show
amber
if
shown
in
direct
light
the
creamy
beige
foam
sticks
around
for
quite
some
making
this
beer
look
quite
delicious
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
linger
in
the
scent
it
actually
smells
a
bit
like
dark
coffee
here
and
there
chocolate
malts
please
my
taste
buds
for
most
of
the
time
in
my
mouth
vanilla
flavors
mixed
with
coffee
appear
here
and
there
and
especially
at
the
end
the
hops
are
almost
non
existent
until
the
very
end
where
there
are
just
enough
to
balance
this
malty
beer
nice
carbonation
for
this
style
but
its
a
bit
sticky
and
very
wet
this
may
work
for
you
but
it
is
the
only
negative
point
for
me
in
a
rather
drinkable
and
enjoyable
dfh
beer
dwith
a
low
abv
and
a
heavy
body
this
body
is
pretty
drinkable
and
rather
tasty
but
has
some
contradicting
characteristics
in
this
department
d
one
of
the
easier
to
drink
dfh
offerings
and
one
of
their
beers
ive
been
more
pleased
with
opinion
this
is
a
good
beer
no
doubt
i
like
the
malt
complexity
the
whole
way
through
and
the
balance
in
the
finish
is
masterfully
crafted
i
like
stouts
and
am
spoiled
by
the
imperials
in
that
i
almost
expect
a
boot
to
the
head
of
flavor
but
this
beer
doesnt
disappoint
even
though
it
is
a
fraction
of
the
og
of
some
impy
stouts
i
am
not
sure
how
much
i
would
drink
this
beer
regularly
but
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
without
hesitation
355ml
bottle
purchased
by
my
girlfriend
at
beer
world
in
largo
fl
black
in
colour
with
an
offwhite
head
and
speckles
of
lacing
on
the
snifter
smell
and
taste
are
roasted
malt
coffee
beans
and
bitter
chocolate
a
fruity
ginger
root
flavour
which
im
guessing
is
the
chicory
gives
off
a
tart
maltiness
followed
by
a
burnt
and
chalky
aftertaste
vinous
red
wine
aromas
develop
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
lush
mediumbodied
moderate
carbonation
pleasant
dryness
to
finish
likely
the
maltiest
beer
ive
had
from
dfh
but
different
in
a
good
way
solid
session
stout
beware
of
the
caffeine
kick
though
d
as
it
is
its
very
drinkable
id
like
to
see
this
amped
up
a
lot
more
chicory
more
coffee
higher
abv
as
it
is
i
think
it
would
make
a
great
although
expensive
session
beer
d
nice
to
drink
a
multidimensional
stout
without
an
abv
to
knock
down
a
horse
drinkability
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
really
wouldnt
want
multiple
glasses
of
this
one
is
enough
the
taste
starts
with
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
like
flavors
then
transitions
into
a
real
unique
kind
of
taste
that
i
can
only
describe
it
is
it
reminds
me
of
the
way
a
beer
tastes
when
its
been
oak
aged
but
without
the
wood
taste
i
mean
by
that
it
gets
kind
of
dry
in
the
middle
and
sucks
the
rest
of
the
flavors
away
it
finishes
pretty
dry
in
the
mouth
despite
a
nice
sweetness
up
front
its
quite
unique
and
still
pretty
strong
after
over
a
year
in
the
bottle
i
am
getting
some
age
and
oxidation
of
this
beer
but
it
isnt
over
the
top
at
this
point
but
i
do
not
see
it
getting
any
better
id
say
12
months
is
a
good
lifespan
imo
less
carbonation
would
have
fixed
most
of
my
complaints
love
beer
live
beer
respect
beer
overall
this
beer
seems
very
wellbalanced
i
am
enjoying
the
flavors
in
here
its
a
stout
but
one
that
is
unique
in
that
there
are
some
herbal
notes
coming
through
but
the
flavor
is
enjoyable
its
pretty
spritzy
on
the
tongue
well
carbonated
allowing
the
flavor
to
linger
for
quite
a
long
time
after
each
sip
notes
bbcsd0912seanh
this
brew
pours
a
nice
black
with
some
brown
around
the
edges
a
rough
pour
yields
a
minimal
one
finger
coffee
colored
head
that
looks
pretty
creamy
aroma
is
of
chocolate
milk
roasted
malts
and
smoke
taste
is
nice
i
really
like
it
starts
chocolatey
then
theres
a
brief
showing
of
roastiness
followed
quickly
by
the
chicory
smokiness
my
only
knock
on
this
beer
is
its
lackluster
finish
and
thin
mouthfeel
if
it
was
only
a
bit
creamier
it
would
be
superb
drinkability
is
high
despite
the
thin
mouthfeel
i
enjoy
the
flavor
enough
to
warrant
having
a
few
the
thin
body
and
low
abv
lend
to
good
drinkability
and
its
not
filling
for
a
stout
not
my
favorite
stout
but
fairly
enjoyable
some
unique
flavors
come
through
in
typical
dfh
fashion
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
to
rave
about
drinkability
is
great
i
could
take
the
entire
sixpack
down
with
a
smile
on
my
face
the
color
stands
throatdeep
in
very
dark
brown
with
even
deeper
blacks
creeping
up
the
legs
on
its
head
is
a
cap
of
light
ecru
that
fades
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
galaxy
of
individual
suds
and
accompanying
ring
the
scent
is
roasty
and
toasty
with
a
slight
smokiness
pulling
some
strings
in
the
backroom
the
taste
emphasizes
the
toast
over
the
roast
and
perfectly
balances
a
subtle
hoppiness
and
a
meek
toffeeandnuts
flavor
beneath
it
all
the
chicory
punctures
the
crust
allowing
an
herbal
lava
to
ooze
out
nicely
settling
into
a
tasty
archipelago
though
it
feels
almost
heavy
on
the
tongue
and
coats
the
mouth
well
it
is
smooth
enough
to
make
the
experience
enjoyable
nothing
spectacular
but
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
either
its
a
standard
but
wellmade
stout
that
plays
with
the
chicory
and
sweeter
flavors
over
the
bitter
coffee
base
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
stout
its
main
flavor
profile
is
good
but
it
has
some
baggage
tart
astringent
baggage
of
which
im
not
a
huge
fan
i
havent
had
chicory
coffee
before
so
im
not
wellversed
in
the
flavor
but
i
feel
like
with
a
little
refinement
this
beer
could
be
stellar
notes
very
good
alternative
to
fbs
if
you
ask
me
and
a
very
fine
stout
in
its
own
right
of
course
d
the
thing
is
i
liked
this
beer
but
there
are
better
stouts
out
there
that
i
like
so
im
not
sure
if
id
get
this
again
im
a
big
dogfish
fan
and
always
wanted
to
try
this
the
body
was
thinner
than
expected
as
well
light
creamy
feel
on
the
tongue
smoky
roasted
flavors
at
first
some
bittering
coffee
presence
in
the
middle
and
a
drying
earthy
finish
this
was
a
pretty
good
stout
not
my
favorite
but
decent
big
disappointment
finish
a
an
exceptional
combination
of
flavors
overall
an
enjoyable
seasonal
that
i
wish
had
a
little
more
complexity
to
the
taste
still
good
though
i
plan
to
try
a
bottled
version
at
some
point
drinkable
at
5
percent
and
decent
mouthfeel
well
balanced
brew
here
d
quite
drinkable
due
to
the
light
mouthfeel
and
balanced
flavors
for
a
stout
this
goes
down
pretty
smooth
overall
its
a
very
tasty
stout
but
a
bit
watery
not
robust
enough
a
double
of
this
i
am
sure
would
be
outstanding
i
do
however
like
the
salty
woodiness
in
the
background
a
very
nice
unique
change
drinkability
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
at
first
but
got
tired
of
the
burnt
and
bitter
coffee
flavor
which
surprised
me
because
i
really
like
coffee
stouts
i
wont
seek
this
out
d
good
drinkability
with
nice
complex
flavors
and
low
abv
drinkability
worth
trying
but
like
chicory
i
think
this
one
is
an
acquired
taste
still
i
found
it
a
nice
postdinner
treat
like
having
a
coffee
after
dinner
i
think
the
bitterness
of
this
beer
would
combine
well
with
a
desert
after
a
meal
drinkability
what
hurts
this
beer
is
the
taste
this
beer
is
creamy
medium
bodied
and
reasonably
complex
once
it
settles
for
a
bit
there
are
some
cocoa
powder
chalky
flavors
there
is
tons
of
roasted
malts
there
are
also
some
charcoal
slightly
harsher
flavors
im
getting
the
chicory
and
the
chocolate
in
balance
with
some
coffee
grain
in
there
too
the
beer
is
fairly
low
abv
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
for
a
complex
stout
and
easy
to
drink
there
are
some
bittersweet
chocolate
notes
the
cherryish
chicory
flavors
are
very
subtle
the
beer
is
dry
in
parts
bittersweet
in
parts
but
with
some
sweeter
malts
interlaced
i
like
it
but
some
folks
might
not
dig
the
little
bit
of
this
little
bit
of
that
quality
of
this
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
not
super
heavy
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
overall
i
found
it
to
be
almost
like
a
dark
sessiontype
beer
with
the
right
amount
of
flavor
to
go
down
quick
huh
i
mean
its
ok
weird
usually
i
think
dfh
goes
overthetop
here
they
didnt
seem
to
go
far
enough
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
just
nothing
particularly
right
d
part
of
me
wishes
this
beer
was
a
bit
more
robust
the
body
in
particular
could
use
some
heft
the
flavor
is
nice
and
this
is
actually
one
of
the
more
sessionable
stouts
ive
had
lately
but
it
falls
short
of
greatness
cheers
overall
it
is
worth
a
try
but
not
a
great
stout
d
easy
drinking
stout
period
dont
look
to
this
brew
if
you
are
looking
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
d
not
simple
not
too
complex
just
good
d
i
was
hoping
this
one
would
warm
on
my
pallet
as
it
warmed
in
the
glass
but
it
remained
very
oaky
bitter
throughout
i
didnt
love
this
beer
but
the
flavor
was
good
i
think
it
would
be
great
if
you
like
your
stouts
a
bit
less
intense
and
with
a
decently
low
abv
d
nothing
overwhelming
but
not
bad
either
i
would
have
again
if
was
looking
for
the
style
a
good
coffee
stout
some
thing
to
enjoy
from
time
to
time
its
an
intereasting
brew
cheers
unfortunately
ive
never
had
chicory
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
that
being
said
though
there
wasnt
an
over
abundance
of
it
because
i
couldnt
even
taste
it
it
must
be
a
fairly
subtle
hint
of
it
what
you
get
is
what
youd
expect
lots
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
flavors
roasted
malt
and
what
not
the
aromas
are
similar
as
well
dvery
easy
drinking
and
if
the
price
point
was
a
little
lower
i
could
this
being
a
personal
staple
in
the
fridge
i
like
this
a
lot
plan
old
easy
to
drink
stouts
are
harder
and
harder
to
find
simple
but
enjoyable
something
i
would
recommend
d
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
dfhs
best
effort
oddly
enough
i
enjoyed
mine
with
a
sandwich
made
of
leftover
holiday
prime
rib
followed
by
a
shortbread
wafer
and
it
went
equally
well
with
both
go
figure
d
as
a
fan
of
stouts
and
coffee
this
is
one
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
again
d
one
of
these
would
be
enough
although
it
was
enjoyable
overall
i
really
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
it
was
just
over
smoked
and
took
away
from
the
coffee
and
chicory
i
probably
wont
be
visiting
this
one
again
i
think
the
chicory
needs
to
be
dumped
up
big
time
here
then
i
can
love
it
for
both
what
it
should
be
as
well
as
what
it
is
d
i
could
have
a
few
and
maybe
more
if
i
got
in
the
mood
for
it
you
know
what
this
is
an
underrated
beer
imho
and
i
usually
go
the
opposite
way
with
dogfishhead
brews
quite
drinkable
mouthfeel
too
thin
though
thanks
to
my
good
friend
jdostal
for
this
generous
hookup
had
this
beer
from
the
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
this
dogfish
head
seasonal
had
a
great
taste
but
might
be
a
little
heavy
for
some
you
could
pick
up
the
extra
hops
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
but
unlike
some
other
stouts
no
one
flavor
was
overpowering
everything
blended
perfectly
great
stout
would
recomend
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
this
beer
had
a
huge
foamy
head
dark
tan
in
color
that
goes
away
in
about
10
minutes
this
beer
produces
very
little
lacing
to
the
glass
it
slowly
works
its
way
down
to
the
liquid
on
each
sip
its
black
in
color
with
brown
highlights
very
dark
beer
the
smell
is
good
clearly
has
a
lot
going
on
smell
of
both
chocolate
and
coffee
slight
hop
at
the
end
it
has
a
good
but
very
complex
flavor
like
the
smell
you
can
taste
both
the
chocolate
and
the
coffee
malts
are
also
very
present
and
this
is
well
hopped
stout
it
has
a
smokey
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
its
the
slightest
bit
too
carbonated
but
still
a
pretty
good
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
is
good
all
in
all
i
like
this
beer
very
tasty
and
complex
this
is
good
id
certainly
get
it
again
in
the
bottle
it
kind
of
tastes
like
the
love
child
between
a
porter
and
stout
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
botttle
into
my
sa
perfect
pint
glass
it
pours
pitch
black
with
a
medium
tan
head
it
has
a
pleasant
not
over
powering
coffee
aroma
to
it
the
coffee
is
a
nice
backbone
for
the
flavor
but
the
malt
bill
in
this
is
a
bit
light
i
find
my
self
wanting
more
body
the
beer
started
off
alright
but
is
is
sort
of
watery
i
liked
this
the
first
few
sips
but
the
body
is
too
thin
for
me
to
really
enjoy
it
cheers
d
as
hearty
as
it
is
it
is
still
very
drinkable
the
flavor
profile
leads
you
on
a
tour
of
roasted
notes
ranging
from
rich
chocolate
to
bitter
coffee
beans
right
on
down
to
a
bit
of
sour
astringency
a
little
light
with
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
but
overall
im
finding
my
chicory
experience
acceptable
out
of
the
growler
generally
easy
to
drink
despite
the
uniqueness
of
the
ingredients
overall
this
is
another
great
product
from
dogfish
head
and
i
would
expect
nothing
less
a
very
good
brew
and
recommended
to
anyone
out
there
that
enjoys
a
good
coffee
stout
of
the
four
seasonal
beers
from
dogfish
head
i
think
this
is
probably
my
second
favorite
its
light
and
sessionable
the
flavor
is
nice
but
doesnt
compare
to
say
bells
expedition
stout
well
worth
checking
out
but
far
from
great
d
one
that
can
be
enjoyed
with
a
rich
meal
or
by
itself
a
strong
session
beer
d
this
cask
offering
was
really
nice
especially
if
you
like
black
licorice
the
addition
of
the
licorice
paired
well
with
the
stout
qualities
of
the
beer
happy
i
had
this
on
cask
d
overall
a
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
offering
from
dogfish
while
the
body
is
a
bit
light
the
body
and
abv
do
lend
a
sessionable
quality
to
this
stout
not
the
most
mind
blowing
stout
ive
ever
tried
but
i
would
purchase
it
again
well
done
with
the
chicory
dogfish
head
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
and
can
see
myself
visiting
it
again
while
its
not
a
chugger
with
the
chicory
notes
one
in
a
sitting
is
a
plenty
its
definitely
one
you
will
want
to
drink
more
than
once
so
go
buy
a
sixer
and
skip
coffee
for
your
next
brunch
just
pleased
to
have
experienced
this
flavorful
beer
just
a
wonderful
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
very
tasty
ill
take
another
please
12oz
bottle
into

pint
glass

a
straight
pour
reveals
a
huge
tan
head
floating
a
top
a
black
beer
with
light
showing
through
the
edges
the
aroma
is
a
lot
of
stout
roasted
barley
chocolates
coffee
and
a
hint
of
smokiness
the
flavor
is
nice
creamy
chocolate
with
coffee
in
the
background
and
a
nice
stout
sourness
lingering
in
the
back
this
is
capped
with
a
touch
of
smokiness
but
its
blended
well
with
the
roasted
malts
etc
its
a
bit
watery
though
kinda
thin
in
flavor
and
body
good
beer
to
share
with
family
and
friends
around
the
holiday
months
i
like
this
beer
and
it
does
have
a
certain
dryness
and
for
me
pretty
strong
dark
roasted
finish
that
may
ot
appeal
to
everyone
overall
impressions
very
nice
smooth
drinking
stout
probably
would
not
be
nearly
as
enjoyable
if
it
was
ice
cold
good
mix
and
balance
of
subtle
flavors
overall
this
is
disappointing
drinkability
solid
this
was
my
third
or
forth
time
drinking
it
at
toast
so
apparently
i
like
it
well
enough
its
not
the
best
stout
ive
had
recently
and
its
not
my
favorite
dogfish
but
i
have
no
problem
ordering
it
when
im
in
the
mood
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
dated
093009ab
sampled
on
december
4
2009
the
pour
is
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
tan
quarter
inch
head
but
it
is
also
a
bit
of
bubbly
carbonation
build
up
on
the
lower
half
of
the
glass
a
pleasing
smoky
and
roasty
hopped
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
bold
and
holds
its
own
on
the
tongue
the
taste
is
smoky
like
a
bonfire
there
is
a
kind
of
bitter
hop
ending
this
is
quite
good
roasted
intenseness
stops
it
from
scoring
top
marks
in
mouthfeel
or
drinkability
d
i
would
love
to
have
another
i
should
have
bought
more
a
very
light
stout
thats
feel
nails
the
style
with
a
dfh
twist
of
flavor
total
opposite
from
wws
d
this
is
an
outstanding
session
stout
glad
it
finally
came
to
ca
and
glad
i
bought
a
sixer
of
it
all
in
all
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
exceptional
but
i
would
definitely
not
call
it
bad
i
went
in
thinking
it
would
be
a
bit
heavier
and
was
surprised
when
it
was
actually
quite
light
d
not
my
fav
strong
boozy
notes
overwhelm
the
roasted
flavor
and
i
never
like
the
soy
sauce
notes
you
get
with
high
alcohol
beers
like
this
ill
stick
with
dog
fish
ipas
for
now
notes
nice
seasonal
offering
from
dfh
while
not
extraordinary
it
is
almost
a
classic
has
a
nice
touch
and
always
nice
to
find
it
every
year
particularly
nice
on
tap
overall
another
nice
offering
form
dfh
not
their
best
but
another
solid
beer
in
their
lineup
ill
probably
pick
some
of
these
up
each
year
for
a
lower
abv
stout
worth
a
try
yes
especially
if
chicory
is
your
thing
i
could
gulp
this
all
night
this
is
a
very
drinkable
tasty
coffee
stout
not
the
best
out
there
but
no
slouch
either
lots
of
flavor
at
a
reasoanble
abv
makes
it
a
good
session
candidate
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
md
full
body
accentuates
the
rich
sweet
flavors
easy
to
drink
but
the
distinct
flavor
can
get
a
bit
repetitive
so
ive
been
keeping
these
to
one
a
session
and
moving
on
to
something
else
very
little
roasted
malt
taste
in
this
stout
pretty
sweet
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
liked
d
a
good
brew
with
tons
of
flavor
though
it
may
sometimes
difficult
to
have
a
session
with
exotic
beers
this
one
isnt
so
far
outer
space
i
could
kick
it
on
this
one
just
like
any
standard
stout
extremely
flavorful
and
enjoyable
and
i
think
the
st
johns
wort
has
me
thinking
in
a
positive
fashion
this
beer
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
stouts
ive
had
very
sessionable
not
the
greatest
stout
ive
ever
had
but
still
quite
good
id
drink
this
again
a
good
session
stout
solid
stuff
decent
price
reliable
never
had
an
off
bottle
taste
is
sweet
and
rich
light
carbonation
and
good
fruity
aftertaste
from
the
chicory
decent
beer
to
check
out
but
it
is
pretty
tame
for
dfh
though
drinkability
easy
drinking
stout
not
overly
impressive
but
also
not
intimidating
at
all
the
best
alternative
to
guiness
and
a
great
gateway
beer
for
guiness
drinkers
summary
i
like
the
roastedearthy
flavor
to
this
one
really
sets
it
apart
from
a
lot
of
other
stouts
will
probably
drink
this
one
again
if
i
see
it
at
a
bar
overall
prefer
my
stouts
to
be
thicker
and
prefer
my
dogfish
to
be
bolder
but
for
the
mood
i
was
in
it
fit
the
bill
nicely
and
went
down
easily
overall
a
very
good
stout
yum
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
and
recommend
this
to
those
seeking
a
smokey
standard
stout
with
a
great
nose
d
a
solid
example
of
the
american
stout
right
up
there
with
bells
kalamazoo
for
a
tasty
lowerabv
drinkable
stout
a
pity
its
not
available
yearround
this
beer
is
smooth
it
has
a
great
body
and
hits
my
soft
spot
for
a
coffee
stout
and
for
10
a
six
pack
it
would
make
a
welcome
appearance
to
anyones
night
excellence
the
appearance
is
almost
black
with
a
quarter
inch
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
the
smell
is
of
coffee
roasted
malt
very
sweet
chocolate
and
perhaps
im
getting
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
there
the
taste
starts
off
with
coffee
which
is
followed
by
the
chocolate
which
is
very
sweet
and
is
ended
by
a
hop
bitterness
accompanied
by
coffee
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
especially
for
a
stout
md
has
a
nice
medium
body
more
like
a
porter
carbonation
is
just
a
bit
on
the
high
side
alcohol
is
subtle
and
makes
for
a
highly
drinkable
beer
this
is
my
first
taste
of
the
dogfish
head
brews
i
was
impressed
hope
to
try
others
soon
living
in
new
orleans
for
3
years
im
a
huge
fan
of
chicory
coffee
i
missed
this
beer
last
year
and
was
super
excited
to
get
the
last
6
pack
at
downtown
wine
and
spirits
now
that
ive
had
it
im
really
really
dissapointed
its
not
bad
but
the
distinctive
chicory
bitter
i
was
hoping
isnt
there
maybe
i
built
this
beer
up
to
be
something
it
wasnt
maybe
its
not
you
its
me
whats
the
deal
dogfish
head
did
you
put
out
a
mediocre
stout
with
chicory
and
mexican
coffee
just
to
prove
that
you
still
have
it
obscure
ingredientwise
i
just
dont
know
what
to
think
anymore
a
nice
drinkable
stout
tastes
sort
of
wintery
and
festive
bonus
points
for
keeping
the
abv
down
this
would
be
nice
to
knock
back
in
some
quantity
if
it
werent
so
expensive
chicory
stout
finally
found
its
way
into
california
six
pack
for
12
the
pour
is
black
and
results
in
one
finger
of
rich
tan
head
fair
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
roasted
barley
dry
cocoa
nuttiness
and
some
coffee
bean
tastes
of
some
roasted
malts
coffee
some
tingly
bitterness
fairly
dry
with
a
biscuity
dry
finish
medium
to
full
in
body
fairly
high
in
carbonation
for
the
style
weakening
the
body
decent
beer
some
unique
flavors
but
nothing
too
complex
i
imagine
some
people
would
really
like
this
and
could
do
a
nice
session
on
it
the
head
crests
at
close
to
three
fingers
of
whipped
up
dimpled
dark
brown
foam
the
bubbles
burst
in
swift
unison
too
frothy
for
there
to
be
much
lacing
very
dark
brown
in
color
falls
just
short
of
black
touch
of
metallic
orange
at
the
outermost
edges
light
roast
to
the
coffee
bean
and
dark
chocolate
notes
in
the
nose
the
chicory
a
little
less
obvious
than
expected
multigrain
bread
not
much
of
a
fruit
presence
not
hops
for
that
matter
texturally
comes
off
as
dusty
mediumbodied
same
dry
dustiness
pervades
the
mouth
like
if
some
coffee
grounds
got
into
your
mug
dark
chocolate
as
if
unsweetened
moderately
more
chicoryled
bitterness
here
carbonation
stays
the
middle
course
as
in
the
nose
no
real
fruit
presence
same
for
spices
citrus
solid
enough
but
definitely
monochrome
the
overall
dryness
detracts
from
mouthfeel
could
drink
a
few
in
a
pinch
but
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
i
am
a
big
dogfish
guy
and
i
liked
this
but
did
not
love
it
smell
was
good
mouthfeel
was
good
but
it
left
me
wanting
a
little
more
after
each
sip
i
was
slightly
making
a
face
like
im
not
loving
this
but
its
dogfish
so
keep
going
itll
get
better
it
really
didnt
deliver
it
was
just
good
not
great
it
was
like
i
was
happy
getting
through
the
brew
but
i
wasnt
loving
each
sip
at
times
it
had
some
medicinal
bite
that
i
cant
explain
but
i
wasnt
in
heaven
thats
for
sure
i
would
drink
it
at
a
party
or
if
served
to
me
but
i
wont
be
purchasing
this
one
anytime
soon
d
this
is
very
drinkable
a
delicious
there
are
lots
of
flavors
but
nothing
is
overwhelming
only
down
side
is
that
it
leaves
a
lingering
sweetness
in
the
mouth
d
very
delicious
and
drinkable
i
dont
know
how
many
of
these
i
would
drink
in
a
night
but
i
could
see
this
being
the
go
to
morning
beer
if
there
is
such
a
thing
great
coffee
profile
and
it
stands
out
among
others
like
it
this
is
a
very
nice
tasting
stout
i
am
not
a
huge
coffee
person
let
alone
having
it
my
brews
but
this
is
a
nice
sessionable
brew
another
solid
offering
from
dfh
d
i
really
enjoy
stouts
i
have
been
trying
more
coffee
stouts
more
i
like
dfh
so
it
was
bound
to
be
good
i
would
recommend
this
if
you
like
stouts
and
especially
if
you
like
coffee
stouts
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
creamy
tan
froth
with
decent
lacing
and
thick
bubbles
yep
theres
the
burnt
chicory
aroma
on
the
nose
followed
by
roasted
coffee
oak
but
thats
the
chicory
dark
chocolate
molasses
charcoal
some
subtle
hop
spice
although
the
nose
is
very
dark
and
burnt
its
very
aromatic
and
pretty
this
beer
tastes
just
like
drinking
a
cold
chicory
coffee
additionally
this
brew
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
you
can
tell
by
the
leaner
body
that
this
is
a
5
2
abv
beer
long
finish
and
would
be
fantastic
to
have
with
dessert
after
a
great
dinner
very
smooth
d
a
very
enjoyable
stout
overall
pick
it
up
if
coffee
stouts
are
your
thing
gimme
some
more
this
beer
was
kind
of
a
let
done
honestly
i
expect
a
bit
better
from
dfh
that
being
said
i
was
a
good
stout
with
a
different
taste
it
is
defiantly
drinkable
and
the
5
abv
leaves
you
and
your
buddy
with
a
empty
6r
not
feeling
a
thing
overall
great
fallwinter
session
beer
i
buy
some
every
year
overall
easy
to
drink
not
overhopped
or
overdone
like
so
many
of
their
beers
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewery
drinkability
i
love
drinking
this
stuff
on
cold
nights
its
the
perfect
session
stout
with
just
enough
of
a
good
thing
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
mesh
nicely
without
zeroing
out
the
rest
of
the
beer
the
low
abv
makes
this
beer
easy
to
drink
a
6
pack
within
a
couple
hours
thank
god
for
chicory
stout
on
these
cold
new
england
nights
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
coffee
stout
its
highly
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
content
is
lower
a
decent
session
coffee
stout
for
sure
i
love
the
funkiness
of
the
herbal
astringencies
of
this
beer
but
it
may
be
something
that
puts
people
off
i
cant
give
this
beer
a
great
grade
there
is
no
wow
factor
but
id
recommend
anyone
giving
this
a
try
dogfishs
chicory
stout
pulls
off
the
coffee
and
stout
combo
perfectly
seriously
copious
amounts
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
beer
roasted
chicory
and
coffee
you
certainly
taste
the
good
notes
of
oat
to
this
beer
and
balanced
with
a
hop
undertone
a
excellent
beer
recommened
for
porterstout
fans
d
not
bad
not
great
though
diggin
the
low
abv
on
a
decent
stout
though
nice
session
stout
more
carbonated
than
i
really
feel
a
stout
should
have
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
for
sure
d
im
happy
to
sit
back
a
session
this
beer
on
any
given
fall
or
winter
evening
pours
deep
brown
with
a
slight
hint
of
red
dark
foamy
head
that
dissipates
into
a
pleasant
lacing
coffee
is
prevalent
in
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
toastiness
taste
is
a
very
good
balance
of
moderately
bold
flavors
coffee
malts
a
bit
bitter
but
well
balanced
its
not
a
session
beer
but
very
satisfying
drinks
pretty
good
but
this
is
a
fairly
low
powered
stout
smell
of
sweet
dark
malts
toast
black
licorice
assertive
sweet
rich
taste
a
strong
blast
of
chicory
coffee
beans
bone
dry
burnt
toast
a
lot
of
sweetness
and
a
creamy
mouth
feel
despite
being
astringent
i
found
this
beer
a
bit
too
astringent
at
times
with
an
offbeat
sourness
that
made
it
all
a
bit
less
palatable
but
in
terms
of
the
roasted
chicory
and
organic
mexican
coffee
bean
flavours
this
beer
is
pretty
up
front
and
in
your
face
almost
overbearing
im
glad
i
checked
this
out
its
an
interesting
attempt
although
not
in
the
same
league
as
many
other
american
stouts
ive
had
overall
an
okay
beer
wasnt
really
my
style
to
begin
with
but
i
surely
dont
regret
trying
it
out
d
this
was
a
decent
stout
but
i
thought
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
boldness
in
the
flavor
profile
still
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
and
i
could
have
had
another
if
the
time
was
right
d
carbonation
ups
the
drinkability
making
this
one
a
decent
session
beer
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
just
not
as
flavorful
as
i
would
go
for
in
a
stout
one
of
my
more
enjoyable
experiences
from
dfh
although
thats
not
saying
too
much
drinkability
i
could
not
see
drinking
several
of
these
in
one
evening
or
even
chasing
one
with
another
but
even
after
drinking
the
pint
i
was
not
full
nor
did
i
have
a
bloated
feeling
that
i
would
have
expected
with
the
amount
of
carbonation
in
the
brew
this
was
definitely
a
new
style
for
me
and
quite
removed
from
what
i
have
experienced
to
date
and
while
i
appreciate
its
complexities
i
believe
the
carbonation
and
the
level
of
hops
would
prevent
me
from
enjoying
another
chicory
stout
from
dogfish
head
overall
this
beer
is
great
it
is
everything
i
expected
and
more
trust
dogfish
head
to
make
a
winner
drinkability
this
beer
gets
alot
of
shit
its
not
the
best
stout
but
i
think
very
solid
i
always
appreciate
dfh
for
trying
things
different
anyone
can
make
a
regular
stout
very
interesting
and
drinkable
i
actually
think
this
is
one
of
dfhs
better
beers
d
a
pretty
smooth
beer
but
drinkability
is
decent
slightly
better
than
average
d
being
at
5
2
abv
i
could
put
these
away
easy
enough
this
is
a
stout
for
coffee
lovers
its
rich
yet
light
and
sweet
if
you
really
hate
coffee
this
might
not
be
your
cup
o
tea
but
because
of
how
much
roasted
coffee
is
in
this
guy
i
would
still
label
it
a
sipper
beer
for
sure
easily
drinkable
and
a
deal
tasty
not
too
complex
in
its
flavor
profile
though
quite
interesting
in
the
nose
most
likely
easily
accessible
to
those
familiar
with
stouts
particularly
the
foreign
export
style
fairly
low
alcohol
content
leads
to
sessionability
very
nice
d
gentle
pleasant
fullflavored
stout
i
would
buy
a
sixfourpack
but
maybe
not
order
another
good
session
beer
d
very
smooth
easy
to
chung
this
one
overall
my
least
favorite
dfh
beer
by
far
to
date
not
horrible
just
kind
of
boring
especially
compared
to
many
of
the
other
great
beers
this
brewery
puts
out
i
figured
a
complex
stout
would
be
something
they
could
really
pull
off
well
but
it
wasnt
so
according
to
this
reviewer
no
much
to
say
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
dfh
brew
it
is
still
a
good
beer
but
its
also
fell
on
the
ordinary
side
of
the
stout
category
d
the
standard
stout
from
dfh
is
one
of
the
core
beers
i
remember
from
the
first
fest
i
ever
had
a
dfh
beer
i
consider
this
a
highly
drinkable
coffee
stout
one
of
the
best
dability
wise
a
must
try
and
i
cant
say
i
am
a
big
fan
of
chicory
on
its
own
this
is
a
very
particular
brew
and
one
that
has
to
be
determined
by
the
individual
palate
i
rather
liked
it
and
the
only
real
issues
were
a
little
weakness
in
the
hops
though
this
is
of
course
a
maltier
brew
that
mild
astringency
and
a
little
excess
slickness
on
the
tongue
its
tasty
though
d
good
stout
to
have
with
the
fairlylow
abv
but
everything
doesnt
quite
fit
together
id
be
interested
to
know
what
this
one
would
taste
like
if
it
had
some
of
the
palo
santo
wood
vibe
to
it
drinkability
is
fantastic
reasonably
sessionable
at
5
2
and
damn
delicious
a
cold
weather
staple
very
interesting
beer
not
the
best
coffee
stout
ive
had
but
the
chicory
adds
and
interesting
twist
overall
a
very
nice
brew
and
i
wish
i
had
a
second
to
follow
it
and
continue
to
tease
out
the
individual
components
of
that
smoked
wood
flavor
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
initial
tan
head
although
the
bottle
promised
bone
white
and
the
tiniest
bit
of
lacing
nice
scent
mostly
coffee
not
even
a
lot
of
stoutburnt
grains
good
taste
a
nice
hit
of
burnt
grains
followed
by
coffee
flavors
with
a
nice
hit
of
chicory
and
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
goes
down
fairly
smooth
drinkability
you
might
be
able
to
knock
a
few
of
these
back
but
i
wouldnt
i
just
dont
like
this
one
and
that
bothers
me
because
i
love
stouts
and
i
love
dfh
very
drinkable
option
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
nice
little
tan
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
smells
of
coffee
rum
raisins
and
chicory
tastes
of
roasted
malts
coffee
chocolate
and
licorice
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
only
bought
a
single
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
of
these
in
the
fridge
overall
a
solid
offering
from
dogfish
head
drinkability
this
is
an
intense
enough
stout
that
one
an
evening
is
quite
enough
i
enjoyed
it
but
will
not
want
another
for
a
few
days
you
also
need
to
let
each
sip
fade
before
the
next
or
it
begins
to
be
too
much
on
the
palate
so
allow
lots
of
time
to
finish
this
one
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
low
carbonation
another
great
beer
from
sam
and
the
boys
at
dfh
overall
a
good
drinkable
stout
well
as
much
as
i
like
some
dogfish
head
beers
this
is
another
disappointment
for
me
this
brewerys
experimental
beers
sometimes
make
me
wish
that
they
would
take
a
step
back
and
not
go
that
extra
step
the
underlying
stout
seems
good
even
the
underlying
coffee
stout
seems
pretty
good
the
chicory
kind
of
bothers
me
it
makes
the
beer
mildly
cloying
i
actually
wouldnt
expect
this
low
of
an
abv
but
it
come
across
a
bit
syrupy
rather
than
big
and
full
this
beer
is
a
long
way
better
than
aprihop
in
my
opinion
but
its
not
something
that
i
would
buy
again
its
an
okay
beer
but
there
are
some
much
better
stouts
maybe
it
would
have
been
better
with
dessert
but
the
beer
itself
gets
a
thumbs
up
here
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
it
seems
very
harsh
and
gravelly
to
me
overall
you
should
probably
try
one
of
these
on
tap
or
a
single
bottle
if
you
can
its
good
enough
for
me
to
order
again
on
its
next
release
possibly
but
i
would
go
for
another
dfh
six
pack
d
dfh
is
typically
hit
or
miss
while
the
hits
normally
outweigh
the
misses
this
one
is
a
big
time
miss
the
aroma
is
pleasant
but
this
brew
falls
short
in
all
other
categories
d
easy
enough
to
finish
but
with
all
the
other
great
american
stouts
out
there
i
dont
think
id
reach
for
another
anytime
soon
maybe
the
bottle
was
just
old
but
i
think
i
remember
liking
this
one
better
last
year
poured
into
a
glass
thin
tan
head
disappeared
in
about
a
minute
cherryblack
color
with
little
light
shining
through
smells
of
roasted
coffee
roasted
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
taste
tasty
mouthful
with
medium
acidity
i
could
drink
a
max
of
6
in
a
sitting
leaves
a
good
taste
in
your
mouth
well
after
finishing
the
bottle
d
very
strong
flavors
balanced
with
bitterness
decent
stout
could
drink
it
again
but
would
have
too
many
in
one
night
the
mouthfeel
is
average
the
aformentioned
carbonation
does
what
youd
expect
as
you
hold
the
beer
with
mouth
closed
0
5
for
the
roasted
liptaste
sensation
i
like
the
taste
of
this
beer
and
im
almost
giddy
its
only
185
calories
to
me
its
another
unique
and
worthwhile
effort
from
dogfish
head
i
meanmexican
coffeeroasted
chicory
now
only
if
i
had
an
imperial
dfh
coffee
maybe
oatmeal
or
maple
syrup
production
to
review
not
a
bad
beer
drinkable
not
unwatchable
like
natalie
was
to
the
facts
of
life
the
facts
of
life
sadly
i
expected
more
from
this
one
especially
being
from
dogfish
head
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
a
good
drinking
beer
especially
on
tap
very
flavorful
well
done
sam
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
no
problem
and
look
forward
to
my
next
experience
with
a
dogfish
head
brew
overall
very
drinkable
but
doesnt
pack
quite
the
punch
i
was
looking
for
the
wateriness
does
it
in
otherwise
a
pretty
nice
beer
d
a
very
pleasant
surprise
with
a
sharp
nutty
and
drying
finish
this
was
the
most
interesting
stout
have
had
in
a
while
partly
because
it
wasnt
very
interesting
there
was
definately
no
thud
as
the
pour
hit
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
felt
this
was
a
lighter
bodied
stout
somthing
that
i
am
not
used
to
be
offered
in
the
winter
months
the
lack
of
distinct
smell
definately
allows
the
flavor
to
ambush
you
the
pour
left
a
relatively
indiscript
dark
brown
stout
in
my
glass
topped
with
a
tanish
head
the
first
sip
is
fantastic
with
no
unpleasant
lingering
of
flavor
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
as
average
as
a
stouts
could
be
again
allowing
the
flavor
to
be
the
star
this
was
a
terrific
beer
that
i
enjoyed
over
the
several
days
that
it
remained
on
tap
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
for
drinking
or
braising
it
comes
on
subtly
with
the
bitterness
increasing
as
it
sits
on
the
tongue
but
this
bitterness
instantly
vanishes
with
the
swallow
leaving
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
in
other
words
it
starts
out
as
a
porter
but
finishes
a
stout
a
bit
sweet
a
bit
bitter
this
beer
surprised
the
hell
out
of
me
a
definite
recommend
it
was
a
chilly
night
and
this
beer
was
perfect
drinkability
while
this
is
not
a
session
beer
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
of
these
one
of
the
best
stouts
that
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
d
good
to
be
sure
but
not
amazing
something
i
could
drink
a
few
of
jet
black
and
completely
opaque
but
with
little
effervescence
which
prevented
it
from
getting
a
good
mouth
feel
and
developing
its
overall
aroma
flavors
are
of
unrefined
coffee
with
a
light
hint
of
semi
sweet
chocolate
finish
it
feels
like
some
it
is
lacking
some
flavor
backbone
to
carry
the
distinct
forward
flavors
d
other
than
the
thin
mouthfeel
this
is
quite
drinkable
to
me
this
is
almost
an
antidogfish
head
beer
theres
nothing
over
the
top
about
this
creation
just
a
very
good
coffee
stout
whats
interesting
is
that
the
malts
and
hops
are
greatly
balanced
so
that
one
is
really
not
detectable
over
the
other
certainly
a
beer
worth
having
and
its
holding
up
nicely
for
being
a
year
old
it
wont
blow
you
away
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
session
coffee
stout
to
keep
the
cold
weather
out
this
wont
disappoint
overall
a
very
drinkable
fullflavored
stout
drinkability
was
good
but
the
beer
just
seemed
to
be
lacking
something
d
a
very
enjoyable
stout
for
a
slightly
unique
take
on
the
style
not
too
crazy
but
just
enough
to
be
memorable
taste
is
of
rich
chocolate
coffee
beans
and
some
spice
dry
finish
leaves
some
spice
on
the
tongue
good
feel
smooth
drinker
pretty
light
for
a
stout
but
still
smooth
note
this
particular
beer
was
dropped
and
may
have
lost
some
carbonation
ill
review
again
with
a
better
sample
when
possible
i
love
what
dfh
does
and
admire
their
breakage
from
german
purity
law
i
love
most
of
their
beers
just
not
this
one
very
good
brew
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dogfish
beers
not
the
most
complex
from
them
but
it
is
tasty
if
you
like
stouts
or
coffee
give
it
a
shot
12
oz
bottle
thanks
to
tayner
aroma
is
roasted
malts
and
brown
sugar
some
sweetness
from
chocolate
and
bitterness
from
coffee
pours
black
but
not
like
tar
head
is
large
at
first
but
dissapates
to
a
smaller
lacing
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
an
oily
finish
carbonation
is
nonexistant
flavor
is
roasted
with
some
coffee
notes
broen
sugar
is
not
noticable
in
the
flavor
some
sweetness
but
the
robust
flavors
from
the
coffee
and
roasted
malts
win
out
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
could
actually
seek
this
out
again
pretty
solid
fairly
enjoyable
i
would
have
it
again
d
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
very
tasty
and
i
will
most
likely
pick
up
another
few
in
the
near
future
d
not
to
bad
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
would
drink
again
just
theres
better
out
there
drinkability
feels
like
this
should
be
a
higher
abv
than
5
20
i
cant
say
id
have
more
than
one
of
these
and
i
dont
know
if
id
buy
it
again
it
does
have
a
uniqueness
to
it
probably
from
the
chicory
that
does
help
it
stand
out
slightly
but
overall
its
just
another
stout
to
me
not
bad
but
not
great
nice
looking
stout
dark
near
black
color
with
a
brown
head
the
nose
has
sweet
roasty
malts
subtle
hops
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
also
is
malt
strong
with
a
hint
of
bitter
hops
chocolate
and
rich
coffee
as
well
full
body
drinks
well
another
tasty
brew
from
dfh
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
but
is
close
to
being
a
porter
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
mild
coffeeflavored
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
but
wouldnt
want
to
session
this
one
to
me
this
is
a
solid
seasonal
brew
its
not
often
you
find
a
stout
this
sessionable
that
still
packs
a
good
amount
of
flavor
and
substance
in
the
mouthfeel
thats
what
keeps
me
buying
it
every
year
this
is
an
excellent
stout
almost
more
of
a
cream
stout
with
its
manner
of
sweetness
tastes
as
though
it
could
have
milk
sugar
in
it
along
with
the
coffee
well
done
solid
stout
an
excellent
session
beer
especially
for
cool
breezy
mornings
or
nights
by
a
roaring
fire
off
the
tap
at
american
flatbread
this
brew
was
a
nearly
opaque
mahogany
color
with
a
tan
head
the
retention
as
a
collar
was
pretty
good
and
the
lacing
in
a
pattern
like
torn
curtains
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malt
nuts
wood
and
light
spices
the
flavors
were
a
bit
odd
the
roasted
malt
seem
to
being
competing
with
the
spices
and
herbal
hops
again
wood
and
nuts
but
neither
was
distinct
mildly
peppery
the
finish
was
coffee
like
and
as
close
to
a
traditional
stout
as
it
got
the
body
was
mediumfull
the
carbonation
semismooth
and
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
oily
not
their
best
work
d
i
really
respect
dfh
i
cant
wait
to
have
more
than
the
little
sips
i
was
afforded
at
the
nola
tasting
this
is
a
great
offbeat
beer
an
enjoyable
unconventional
stout
in
some
regard
is
perhaps
a
tad
overly
reliant
on
the
coffee
grounds
and
bittersweet
rootiness
of
the
chicory
but
a
good
flavor
and
another
good
beer
from
dfh
d
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
drinkability
is
ok
as
there
is
no
alcohol
burn
not
a
terribly
large
amount
of
flavor
here
and
practically
no
coffee
flavor
drinkability
i
could
have
two
to
three
i
will
have
this
again
the
flavor
is
good
and
the
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
such
a
letdown
the
appearance
and
smell
are
amazing
but
the
taste
and
feel
are
unbearable
d
strange
brew
kill
whats
inside
of
you
maybe
dont
go
that
far
but
the
makeup
of
this
brew
is
strange
and
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
get
this
one
again
just
a
stones
throw
down
the
wrong
road
for
me
at
least
eric
this
is
a
dry
and
highly
bitter
stout
lots
of
black
patent
malt
the
body
is
thin
for
the
style
theres
an
above
average
amount
of
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
brief
but
brings
more
bitter
unsweetened
chocolate
very
drinkable
if
i
were
a
coffee
drinker
id
definately
switch
out
some
folgers
for
this
m
very
smooth
but
a
bit
lighter
than
i
would
expect
from
a
stout
dark
brown
pour
with
a
rich
but
short
lasting
light
brown
cocoa
head
nice
smokiness
to
the
smell
bringing
up
some
lapsang
sauchong
tea
aromas
faint
coffee
notes
could
be
stronger
taste
is
the
same
a
bit
of
rauchbier
smokiness
with
some
coffee
taste
nice
medium
body
not
overly
rich
but
good
nice
low
alcohol
and
nice
tastes
make
this
a
very
pleasing
go
to
session
beer
had
this
with
smoked
oysters
and
crackers
and
it
was
spot
on
a
staple
fridge
beer
to
be
certain
dfh
really
hits
the
mark
with
flavorful
low
abv
beer
like
this
one
and
festina
peche
wish
they
would
do
more
this
is
a
nice
coffee
stout
that
doesnt
bash
you
over
the
head
with
complexities
the
flavor
is
mild
and
simple
but
its
quite
good
if
thats
the
kind
of
beer
youre
looking
for
then
by
all
means
pick
some
up
recommended
overall
an
interesting
beer
some
off
notes
keep
it
from
being
better
id
like
to
see
more
coffee
this
one
poured
a
dark
black
mahogany
color
with
a
whispy
tan
ring
left
on
top
and
modest
lacing
the
nose
picks
up
tart
coffee
raisin
with
a
hint
of
charcoal
and
molasses
the
first
swig
gets
a
relatively
sharp
acidic
wood
with
cherry
hints
and
a
solid
smoke
background
it
has
a
smooth
malt
overtone
but
the
tart
sharpness
is
undeniable
very
decent
overall
impression
this
beer
threw
me
for
a
loop
upon
smelling
the
brew
i
expected
a
thick
rich
and
robust
beer
however
when
i
tasted
it
i
received
a
beer
that
was
both
light
in
flavor
and
body
the
roasted
notes
some
through
with
a
slight
very
slight
hint
of
sweetness
i
would
suggest
this
beer
for
someone
who
still
wants
beer
with
a
fantastic
aroma
yet
not
a
huge
robust
and
thick
body
this
beer
pairs
well
with
chili
eating
a
bowl
as
i
review
and
i
could
see
it
going
well
with
a
nice
slice
of
cheesecake
or
pumpkin
pie
i
would
easily
buy
this
beer
again
especially
if
i
could
try
it
on
tap
4
0
d
smooth
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
ok
i
would
not
buy
it
again
however
i
would
take
one
if
offered
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
most
pedestrian
of
dfh
brews
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
bottled
on
120208
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
this
stout
poured
a
modestly
dark
brown
that
displayed
some
nice
ruby
edges
when
held
up
to
light
a
onefinger
thick
head
of
creamy
tan
foam
settled
a
bit
then
lasted
throughout
the
entire
glass
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
freshly
roasted
coffee
caramelized
sugar
and
a
light
herbalmint
note
the
flavor
also
showed
a
nice
evenly
roasted
coffee
note
followed
by
caramel
a
bit
of
chocolate
a
hint
of
licorice
and
a
very
mild
hop
bite
at
the
finish
to
even
things
out
mellow
and
quite
tasty
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
had
moderate
carbonation
this
stout
incorporated
each
flavor
evenly
without
the
coffee
overpowering
the
subtle
sweetness
a
really
nice
beer
drinkability
um
not
sure
what
to
say
here
this
doesnt
taste
bad
just
strong
and
biting
akin
to
drinking
straight
sour
mix
from
the
bar
mixers
it
is
good
but
strong
and
not
something
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
interesting
though
as
much
of
dfhs
offerings
recommend
other
dogfish
before
else
d
this
guy
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
with
its
lower
abv
the
butt
of
the
beer
doesnt
make
me
giddy
to
take
the
next
sip
i
probably
should
just
smell
this
beer
instead
of
drinking
it
d
it
is
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
i
could
do
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
my
palate
would
need
something
else
a
very
interesting
stout
on
a
side
note
id
like
to
see
this
as
a
regular
release
dogfish
makes
a
lot
of
really
out
there
stuff
thats
cool
to
get
a
bottle
of
once
in
awhile
but
thats
it
i
personally
think
this
would
be
a
great
counterpoint
to
their
60minute
ipa
in
terms
of
a
normal
beer
line
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
dogfish
heads
crazy
stuff
just
not
4
or
6
at
a
time
d
anyone
would
enjoys
stouts
or
porters
would
really
enjoy
this
one
not
too
heavy
so
you
cant
that
much
but
just
heavy
enough
that
it
keeps
you
from
going
overboard
at
5
2
could
have
a
fewvery
nice
overallcertainly
worth
a
try
pours
an
inky
black
body
brown
tan
head
average
and
diminishing
aroma
of
coffee
and
semibitter
chocolate
heavy
dark
roasted
aroma
very
strong
coffee
scent
sweet
chocolate
taste
more
sweet
than
bittersweet
medium
creamy
palate
some
coffee
taste
pretty
good
very
dark
and
smelled
of
coffee
and
malt
the
head
was
one
finger
and
medium
dark
brown
this
beer
is
smooth
and
drinks
well
there
is
a
roasted
flavour
which
keeps
your
attention
the
whole
time
you
have
this
beer
in
your
mouth
the
flavour
is
hard
to
pinpoint
there
was
good
lacing
on
the
glass
as
you
consumed
this
beer
good
beer
which
i
would
drink
again
had
it
in
a
imperial
pint
form
tastes
of
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
coffee
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
creamy
and
chewy
but
maybe
a
bit
too
carbonated
not
a
bad
beer
but
with
the
carbonation
and
a
bitterness
i
dont
think
this
is
as
drinkable
as
some
other
stouts
ive
had
this
is
the
perfect
stout
as
far
as
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
go
not
too
heavy
despite
the
color
medium
body
and
carbonation
is
perfect
warming
despite
the
low
alcohol
content
i
could
see
myself
drinking
the
whole
6er
in
one
night
easily
very
good
beer
here
the
bottle
claims
mexican
coffee
and
chicory
the
coffee
stands
out
much
more
than
the
chicory
although
it
is
there
for
a
second
i
thought
i
was
drinking
a
smoked
beer
it
pours
a
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
leaving
light
lacing
that
is
quite
sticky
the
initial
taste
is
overwhelmingly
coffee
almost
burnt
not
bad
it
feels
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
like
but
that
is
all
relative
with
a
beer
of
this
style
i
enjoyed
it
but
would
wait
a
while
to
buy
another
6
pours
100
black
with
a
big
poofy
microbubbled
head
that
seems
to
stick
to
just
about
anything
aroma
reminds
me
of
some
of
my
less
favorable
homebrew
stouts
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
with
strong
hints
of
plastic
the
body
of
this
beer
is
the
first
thing
that
strikes
me
very
very
pleasantly
smooth
with
just
enough
carbonation
a
lot
of
the
time
i
object
to
this
kind
of
water
quality
in
other
beers
im
always
complaining
that
some
breweries
dont
treat
their
water
correctly
for
the
style
but
this
seems
about
right
for
an
american
stout
but
would
be
way
wrong
for
and
ipa
or
anything
any
chicory
in
there
must
be
very
mellow
ive
only
had
oaked
beers
before
and
this
is
a
lot
lighter
in
wood
character
it
mostly
comes
out
with
the
roasted
malt
to
bring
out
some
sweetness
and
round
out
some
of
the
edges
this
also
seems
radically
underhopped
for
an
american
stout
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
its
a
little
too
close
to
my
crappy
homebrew
which
makes
me
think
something
is
wrong
hv
not
the
most
outstanding
coffee
beers
but
it
does
the
job
the
taste
is
ok
but
just
no
complete
well
it
certainly
isnt
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
dfh
but
a
solid
beer
none
the
less
the
appearance
is
the
best
feature
for
me
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
tons
of
lacing
going
down
the
glass
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
for
me
even
for
a
stout
almost
get
a
stale
coffee
sort
of
vibe
from
it
but
there
are
some
good
roasted
type
of
tastes
in
there
as
well
to
balance
it
out
not
one
of
dfh
bests
but
still
better
than
most
other
stouts
the
taste
consists
mostly
of
an
interplay
between
the
roasted
chocolate
and
light
hints
of
black
licorice
somewhat
straightforward
and
simple
but
enjoyable
the
finish
is
a
bit
weak
as
the
flavor
just
seems
to
trail
off
with
a
metallic
tinge
the
mouthfeel
is
less
than
inspiring
coming
off
slightly
thin
seeming
to
exist
but
failing
to
exert
any
influence
upon
the
beer
easy
drinking
stout
on
this
wet
and
cold
december
day
a
touch
too
carbonated
but
the
body
is
nice
enough
im
not
sure
that
this
really
worth
more
than
one
of
i
will
say
that
it
paired
excellently
with
some
smokey
jalapeno
sauce
atop
some
simple
deepfried
tacos
you
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
if
you
really
loved
it
i
dont
and
i
probably
will
never
buy
this
again
its
not
that
its
bad
but
its
average
which
is
about
the
worst
thing
i
can
think
of
to
say
about
a
beer
d
high
because
of
the
consistency
opaque
color
with
a
tan
vanishing
head
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
roast
black
coffee
and
smokypeppery
notes
tastes
of
light
sugar
cane
with
malty
roast
background
cocoa
chicory
light
medicinal
notes
a
mildlyrich
and
smooth
taste
creates
a
very
enjoyable
drink
for
any
season
a
relatively
light
body
for
a
stout
and
lacks
the
richness
that
other
stouts
offer
but
a
pretty
good
variation
im
a
fan
of
the
smokey
traits
but
it
doesnt
have
the
solid
body
coffee
java
joe
thick
black
body
aroma
of
light
coffee
and
tad
of
jalepeno
chocolate
slide
with
a
touch
of
expresso
and
a
warming
set
of
peppers
a
coffee
infused
with
hot
chocolate
and
cayenne
pepper
spice
ontop
of
crisp
carbonation
equally
balancing
for
a
temperate
exotic
treat
and
thank
god
it
comes
in
a
sixer
and
not
a
four
pack
i
hate
that
new
trend
not
bad
but
not
the
amazing
top
notch
brew
i
usually
hope
for
from
dfh
id
drink
it
again
but
its
nothing
incredibly
unique
as
there
are
a
good
deal
of
coffee
brews
out
there
worth
a
try
but
this
isnt
one
i
can
see
myself
drinking
on
a
regular
basis
its
drinkable
but
very
thin
overall
this
is
enjoyable
but
falls
extremely
short
of
the
bar
set
by
dogfish
heads
world
wide
stout
average
effort
edit
overstated
the
mouthfeel
in
initial
review
this
does
lower
my
score
a
bit
drinkability
is
good
but
again
being
so
roasty
and
bitter
one
is
enough
i
hesitated
buying
a
6
pk
and
settled
for
a
single
at
my
local
andersons
now
i
wish
i
had
more
drinkability
pretty
high
for
the
style
the
co2
makes
it
go
down
like
pop
thats
soda
to
most
of
you
too
bad
i
cant
replace
my
morning
coffee
with
this
stuff
o
a
good
stout
for
coffee
lovers
like
me
future
outlook
not
likely
to
purchase
again
in
the
foreseeable
future
drinkability
this
is
a
great
beer
as
i
mentioned
at
the
heading
of
this
review
im
very
pleased
with
it
ive
had
a
ton
of
luck
with
the
american
stouts
and
feel
ive
almost
been
too
fortunate
with
them
i
hope
my
luck
continues
notes
it
was
o
k
nothing
for
me
to
go
on
and
on
about
retool
this
one
and
it
could
be
a
lot
better
it
was
easy
to
drinkso
worth
the
try
pretty
good
overall
worth
trying
if
you
even
remotely
like
stouts
and
or
coffee
on
tap
right
off
one
has
to
like
chicory
and
mexican
coffee
to
enjoy
this
beer
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
with
no
head
aroma
of
mostly
chocolate
with
some
coffee
spice
and
roasted
malt
strong
taste
slightly
smoky
a
lot
of
oatmeal
and
coffee
up
front
then
the
malts
and
slight
hops
the
finish
is
very
different
all
of
a
sudden
the
beer
turns
into
a
chocolate
malt
and
ends
dry
this
is
like
no
other
stout
out
there
im
a
pretty
big
fan
of
dogfish
head
by
and
large
i
think
they
really
hit
the
mark
with
their
brews
this
beer
however
im
not
so
sure
of
the
appearance
is
good
not
quite
pure
black
but
close
with
a
tan
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
funky
though
its
hard
to
pin
point
exactly
but
its
almost
like
a
blend
of
dark
berries
and
metal
usually
when
you
stick
your
sniffer
down
into
a
nice
dark
stout
you
come
out
with
coffee
chocolate
and
roasty
aromas
in
this
one
the
fruity
herbal
metallic
notes
seem
to
dominate
i
dont
think
i
would
be
opposed
to
those
aromas
if
they
were
secondary
to
the
malts
but
the
fact
that
they
take
over
leaves
me
a
little
dissatisfied
the
taste
is
also
a
little
off
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
situation
where
there
are
multiple
flavors
but
instead
of
blending
together
in
harmony
produce
a
strange
mixedup
cacophony
where
it
is
hard
to
tell
just
what
you
are
actually
tasting
the
aftertaste
is
one
of
raisins
prunes
and
port
which
i
kind
of
dig
but
then
when
you
take
another
sip
you
lose
the
mild
semisweet
dried
fruit
flavors
and
go
right
back
into
the
metallic
and
almost
astringent
taste
that
im
not
a
fan
of
now
of
course
this
is
just
my
opinion
some
may
find
this
beer
very
intriguing
and
probably
the
brewers
knew
they
were
going
a
little
off
the
beaten
track
adding
chicory
to
the
kettle
but
i
find
it
a
little
confusing
and
not
quite
my
bag
im
a
big
believer
in
a
wellrounded
wellbalanced
harmonious
beer
this
one
is
just
a
little
out
of
whack
for
my
taste
buds
a
slight
letdown
from
my
usual
great
experiences
with
dogfish
head
taste
is
of
chicory
coffee
again
with
a
sweet
malty
finish
reviewing
the
other
reviews
i
was
worried
i
may
not
like
this
beer
but
i
found
it
highly
enjoyable
if
you
like
your
coffee
black
and
darkroasted
try
this
one
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
small
beige
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
lacing
that
lasts
aroma
has
hints
of
chocolate
maltiness
coffee
raisins
and
other
dark
berries
smokiness
and
of
course
cherry
a
mouthfull
of
roasted
coffe
up
front
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
finishes
dry
and
a
little
bitter
this
is
a
good
stout
it
has
a
nice
roasty
malt
flavor
it
wasnt
too
heavy
as
some
stouts
can
be
it
had
nice
lively
carbonation
the
chicory
flavor
was
evident
the
malt
flavor
was
nice
and
burnt
the
aroma
was
great
with
a
jet
black
color
and
a
bone
white
head
try
it
once

drinkability
excellent
at

you
this
wont
knock
your
socks
off
this
was
just
fine
but
ive
come
to
expect
more
from
dogfish
head
nothing
too
revolutionary
about
it
a
black
color
with
some
tanish
head
big
coffee
in
the
nose
nothing
else
comes
through
just
coffee
taste
is
just
great
full
of
coffee
malt
not
really
aggressive
rather
light
and
nice
the
thickness
is
good
and
nice
activity
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
stout
very
much
worth
a
try
if
you
ever
see
it
beer
pours
a
deep
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
1
12
inch
coffee
color
head
that
fades
quickly
slight
foamy
lacing
scent
is
strong
on
coffee
light
dark
chocolate
and
malts
taste
is
truly
coffee
flavored
great
body
minimal
to
no
aftertaste
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
stout
though
i
would
dare
to
say
its
more
like
a
porterstout
if
given
the
chance
i
will
pick
it
up
again
my
verdict
is
that
this
is
a
great
beer
it
is
not
very
stoutlike
at
all
though
it
tastes
like
a
coffeeporter
same
body
as
well
if
you
are
into
porters
and
darkroasted
coffee
go
for
it
dogfish
always
makes
a
great
brew
so
its
worth
a
try
fresh
bottling
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
and
quickly
diminishing
white
foam
not
bottle
conditioned
flavor
and
aroma
are
very
similar
both
lacking
in
elements
besides
coffee
i
know
its
a
5
stout
but
come
on
this
beer
has
so
malt
depth
and
no
body
very
dry
and
off
balance
i
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
new
belgium
globe
this
beer
pours
a
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
small
inch
head
that
disappeared
into
just
a
thin
rim
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
leaving
no
lacing
whatsoever
the
aroma
follows
the
name
chicory
coffee
straight
up
front
reminds
me
of
having
a
cup
on
bourbon
street
in
new
orleans
also
there
is
just
a
bit
of
molasses
and
a
hint
of
espresso
the
taste
is
100
chicory
coffee
its
really
amazing
that
the
taste
is
so
well
represented
in
a
beer
if
you
like
chicory
and
i
know
quite
of
few
of
you
dont
try
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
astringent
and
finishes
extremely
dry
if
you
like
chicory
which
is
a
acquired
flavor
to
begin
with
you
will
love
this
beer
if
not
chances
are
youll
hate
it
d
it
was
drinkable
but
not
in
the
way
that
a
stout
should
be
it
lacked
the
richness
and
filling
qualities
that
make
a
good
stout
not
all
its
cracked
up
to
be
but
still
a
relatively
average
stout
the
aroma
is
bitter
and
has
a
decent
note
of
roasted
malts
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
good
initial
pour
very
dark
brown
with
a
large
head
that
quickly
dwindles
and
leaves
virtually
no
lacing
not
very
full
especially
for
a
stout
the
thinness
in
the
mouthfeel
is
a
real
let
down
flavor
is
relatively
standard
some
strong
coffee
notes
really
come
through
other
than
that
this
is
pretty
basic
for
a
stout
glad
i
didnt
sink
10
into
getting
the
entire
sixer
d
not
too
bad
better
on
draft
than
in
the
bottle
not
my
favorite
from
dfh
but
not
the
worst
beer
out
there
either
drinkable
but
i
have
become
spoiled
by
dfh
and
expect
more
pours
a
blackish
color
on
the
pour
no
head
forms
on
the
pour
only
a
slight
ring
develops
smell
is
roasted
malts
and
some
coffee
taste
is
very
coffee
forward
very
roasted
coffee
and
not
too
much
else
stands
a
chance
to
make
itself
known
a
pretty
decent
stout
that
im
not
sure
if
its
a
regular
offering
anymore
if
so
its
a
good
regular
beer
overall
its
interesting
for
a
stout
definitely
not
just
average
run
of
the
mill
however
i
think
the
sweetness
is
a
little
lost
in
the
bitterness
for
many
this
may
be
a
pro
but
as
far
as
returnable
drinkability
is
concerned
this
is
a
con
for
me
very
interesting
though
again
drinkability
i
got
this
as
a
single
and
its
about
two
years
aged
as
the
flavors
are
well
mixed
im
thinking
age
has
done
this
well
i
could
have
another
as
an
after
dinner
drink
i
like
the
rough
biting
flavor
of
this
brew
wish
i
could
get
it
reguarly
overall
fairly
drinkable
beer
while
hitting
up
others
at
the
pub
this
was
the
one
i
drank
during
both
visits
and
enjoyed
equally
as
a
dinnerlate
night
beer
as
well
as
starting
off
a
warm
afternoon
ambling
around
the
beach
a
solid
reliable
stout
originally
reviewed
on
8708
i
had
the
pleasure
of
having
this
beer
again
as
my
first
beer
of
2010
i
am
really
glad
i
can
get
this
locally
now
a
good
flavorful
coffee
shout
that
isnt
over
the
top
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
is
a
good
find
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
halfinch
light
tan
head
smells
mostly
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
a
touch
of
candy
tastes
begins
with
coffee
then
some
delicate
doughy
essence
and
finally
a
little
bitterness
creamy
mouth
feel
with
subtle
carbonation
wellbalanced
and
medium
body
of
flavor
overall
an
enjoyable
mild
stout
poured
a
clear
brownish
black
color
with
1
finger
of
foamy
tan
head
good
retention
and
nice
lines
of
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
citrus
hops
tastes
similar
to
the
aroma
roasted
malt
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
up
front
followed
by
a
good
amount
of
coffee
flavors
finishes
with
some
pepper
and
hops
medium
light
in
body
smooth
with
lots
of
coffee
bitterness
another
unique
brew
from
dogfish
head
very
easy
to
drink
flavorful
and
sessionable
with
its
lower
abv
for
those
coffee
addicts
out
there
overall
a
pretty
solid
stout
i
might
drink
it
again
smooth
with
nice
carbonation
dfhs
chicory
stout
is
a
nice
roasty
drink
that
neither
overpowers
nor
underwhelms
one
could
pass
the
afternoon
loitering
with
your
buddies
and
making
easy
work
of
several
of
these
bottles
recommend
adding
steamed
little
necks
and
moist
chocolate
cake
d
i
might
have
a
couple
of
these
but
the
intense
coffee
flavor
puts
me
off
a
little
wouldve
prefered
this
brew
a
little
smoother
with
a
little
less
carbonation
i
love
me
a
good
coffee
infused
stout
i
picked
this
up
for
the
olde
time
feel
of
chicory
it
makes
me
feel
like
a
civil
war
solder
the
look
is
nice
with
a
medium
fluffy
head
that
comes
just
short
of
the
bone
white
of
the
bottle
description
the
head
and
look
would
probably
benefit
greatly
from
a
nitro
tap
the
smell
is
a
bit
light
for
the
style
a
nice
strong
smell
is
a
hallmark
of
a
good
coffee
stout
the
taste
was
a
harsh
roasted
flavor
with
a
fruity
undertone
the
chicory
is
know
for
being
less
smooth
than
coffee
and
that
comes
through
in
the
beer
i
have
to
say
that
i
prefer
a
nice
smooth
coffee
infused
sweet
stout
but
this
beer
is
interesting
and
different
always
great
to
have
some
dfh
good
stuff
indeed
taste
is
different
but
not
in
a
bad
way
obviously
there
is
roasted
coffee
in
there
along
with
a
nuttiness
and
bittersweet
chocolate
there
is
also
some
herbal
characteristics
in
there
there
is
a
slight
sourness
present
there
is
a
lingering
coffee
flavor
on
the
palate
a
unique
and
enjoyable
stout
not
something
i
would
want
all
the
time
but
still
good
pours
a
black
color
with
a
little
brownish
hue
when
its
first
poured
a
large
2
inch
light
brown
head
rests
on
top
and
dies
down
slowly
leaving
a
thin
layer
on
top
with
plenty
of
bubbles
smell
is
doughy
with
a
creamy
cup
of
coffee
aroma
and
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
like
a
creamy
cup
of
coffee
and
a
punch
of
a
bitterness
right
at
the
very
end
creamy
mouthfeeling
that
lingers
with
the
bitter
coffee
taste
this
beer
seems
to
have
quite
a
bit
of
potential
though
falls
short
of
a
true
great
perhaps
a
fresher
sample
would
change
things
flavor
is
coffee
and
roast
malt
with
some
mild
cocoa
flavor
in
the
background
the
flavor
lingers
longe
after
each
swallow
no
real
hop
presence
no
hint
of
the
mild
abv
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
could
drink
several
of
them
in
a
row
i
love
a
good
stout
and
this
was
a
good
one
enjoyed
this
one
slightly
chilled
in
my
thick
warsteiner
mug
poured
a
midnight
black
with
a
good
head
smells
of
blck
roasted
coffee
with
some
chicory
and
a
hint
bittersweet
chocolate
tastes
of
black
coffee
but
was
tamed
by
the
bittering
hops
well
done
dogfish
head
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
enjoyed
this
i
enjoy
anything
from
dogfish
not
my
favorite
stout
the
first
few
sips
revealed
a
lot
of
interesting
flavors
but
everything
just
kinda
blended
together
by
the
time
this
one
was
done
and
like
i
said
earlier
if
you
like
some
beer
with
your
coffee
this
will
definitely
be
your
thing
but
if
not
it
will
wear
on
you
after
a
while
d
good
drinkability
a
big
hearty
dark
roasted
treat
that
may
limit
multiples
but
wont
disappoint
and
satisfies
to
the
last
sip
highly
disappointing
effort
from
dogfish
it
goes
down
well
and
doesnt
blast
the
palate
so
while
it
could
make
a
good
session
stout
its
just
really
not
worth
it
my
mouth
just
doesnt
pine
for
that
next
sip
as
it
does
with
beers
with
more
substance
the
flavors
are
diluted
outside
of
the
roastiness
character
in
the
finish
so
perhaps
this
would
be
a
good
entry
level
beer
for
those
foraging
into
the
style
however
it
is
too
light
for
me
to
want
to
revisit
any
time
soon
this
poured
opaque
black
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
a
typical
stout
with
milk
chocolate
and
earthy
malts
it
tasted
like
a
standard
mix
of
chocolate
and
coffee
along
with
soil
maybe
chicory
it
was
moderately
thick
with
no
carbonation
and
had
a
smooth
and
sweet
coffee
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
good
stout
but
it
wasnt
nearly
as
unique
as
i
was
expecting
im
not
sure
exactly
what
chicory
is
supposed
to
taste
like
but
i
didnt
taste
anything
unusual
in
this
beer
its
still
tough
to
be
disappointed
in
a
beer
that
tastes
this
good
drinkability
an
excellent
american
stout
one
of
the
nicer
examples
of
this
style
drinkability
is
great
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
has
a
flavor
all
its
own
wonderful
proportioning
and
solid
complexity
make
this
one
a
notable
stout
cheers
drinkability
i
like
the
chicory
in
here
but
in
the
end
it
doesnt
really
make
it
that
much
more
interesting
than
any
other
wellcrafted
stout
fortunately
this
is
a
wellcrafted
stout
itself
a
bit
too
sugary
or
rather
not
hoppy
enough
but
still
perfectly
pleasant
to
sip
overall
this
was
not
bad
however
it
was
a
little
underwhelming
for
me
i
expect
everything
from
dfh
to
really
push
through
and
hammer
down
styles
i
was
just
not
so
sure
this
one
was
really
that
big
of
a
winner
definitely
worth
a
try
no
doubt
just
not
as
big
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
m
d
not
as
creamy
as
i
might
have
thought
but
that
didnt
detract
from
it
in
the
least
nice
modest
to
keep
in
line
with
the
other
characteristics
of
it
the
shimmer
of
carbonation
adds
a
nice
life
to
it
all
nicely
done
and
it
ended
up
exceeding
my
expectations
for
it
mind
you
i
dont
really
know
what
those
were
to
be
honest
i
will
however
be
picking
some
more
up
in
the
near
future
probably
one
of
the
few
dfh
beers
i
could
session
as
the
abv
is
rather
low
for
them
good
drinkability
i
could
put
down
a
6
of
this
no
problem
i
want
to
bbq
with
this
pours
a
nice
black
from
the
bottle
with
a
tall
and
thick
tan
head
that
laced
the
glass
very
well
all
the
way
down
the
smell
is
of
nice
deeply
roasted
malts
some
caramel
and
some
coffee
aromas
the
taste
was
pretty
good
nice
roasted
malt
base
which
was
built
on
by
a
nice
caramely
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
coffee
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
fresh
and
pretty
smooth
this
was
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
i
would
definately
get
it
again
pours
black
with
a
short
lived
brownish
head
smell
is
coffee
roastiness
chocolate
and
a
smell
typical
of
organic
beers
taste
is
roasty
chocolately
and
coffee
like
with
a
bit
of
a
strange
dull
and
abrupt
finish
perhaps
from
the
chicory
another
interesting
beer
from
dfh
and
drinkable
although
not
a
favorite
of
mine
d
a
little
bit
to
abrasive
to
have
much
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
a
little
too
light
and
unbalanced
to
be
much
more
than
that
dont
drink
and
review
on
nitrotap
at
the
rehoboth
beach
pub
dark
brownblack
in
color
clear
with
mahogany
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
nice
creamy
tan
persistent
head
with
lacing
all
the
way
down
espresso
molasses
dark
dried
fruits
and
vague
spices
in
the
nose
taste
starts
with
sweet
dark
malts
also
nutty
and
some
soft
spice
with
a
softly
roasty
drying
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
somewhat
thin
and
quite
creamy
stouts
are
not
my
style
but
i
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
were
it
not
for
the
randall
overall
its
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
beer
d
not
bad
not
amazing
but
id
drink
it
anytime
its
around
d
a
slow
drinker
and
just
ok
there
are
better
stouts
it
just
felt
soft
overall
yeah
not
a
bad
stout
the
chicory
adds
some
interesting
note
but
not
exceptional
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
though
i
think
the
drinkability
is
decent
although
i
would
personally
grow
tired
of
the
abrasive
higher
than
most
stouts
carbonation
as
well
as
the
persistent
coffee
flavor
its
a
good
stout
though
and
has
good
flavor
and
balance
if
you
like
darker
beers
give
it
a
whirl
overalla
distinctive
flavor
and
i
appreciate
the
effort
at
creativity
by
the
brewer
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
american
stouts
out
there
and
wouldnt
be
something
id
go
try
to
have
again
another
solid
offering
from
doghead
this
brew
pours
a
deep
black
which
shows
off
no
hues
head
is
tan
and
very
creamy
with
some
thickness
the
brew
itself
isnt
all
that
thick
aroma
is
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
molasses
taste
has
a
roasted
character
likely
the
chicory
a
nice
chocolate
flavor
and
some
coffee
beans
to
lend
to
the
bitterness
very
smooth
and
drinkable
not
a
lot
wrong
with
this
brew
not
as
good
as
some
of
dfhs
other
brews
but
very
solid
this
is
a
tasty
luxuriant
but
flawed
stout
certainly
worth
trying
and
i
could
see
buying
it
again
but
not
on
my
alist
of
american
stouts
dogfish
head
hits
on
just
about
everything
but
id
have
to
call
chicory
stout
a
miss
despite
the
high
marks
for
appearance
and
mouthfeel
maybe
thats
why
i
havent
come
across
it
until
now
has
a
heck
of
a
head
to
go
with
it
black
body
and
a
smell
of
what
i
guess
is
chicory
the
taste
is
overwhelming
of
chicory
too
blocking
out
all
the
other
tastes
i
can
honestly
say
it
wasnt
the
tase
i
was
expecting
and
its
not
a
taste
i
enjoyed
personally
i
guess
i
dont
like
the
taste
of
chicory
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
lite
bodied
i
couldnt
drink
more
then
one
but
mostly
because
of
the
taste
not
the
mouthfeel
or
alcohol
content
at
5
2
this
isnt
one
of
their
heavier
beers
ill
be
sticking
with
stouts
minus
the
chicory
from
now
on
good
stuff
from
dogfish
but
ive
definitely
had
better
still
worth
a
try
d
the
excellent
taste
of
this
and
lighter
abv
from
typical
dogfish
head
brews
make
this
one
easy
to
drink
one
could
find
themselves
drinking
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
pours
a
nice
dark
black
rocky
and
brown
head
is
nice
and
slowly
breaks
down
to
a
very
nice
lace
the
aroma
is
amazing
very
different
and
the
chicory
is
up
front
the
taste
is
coffee
and
has
a
sweet
burn
sugar
taste
hints
of
chocolate
as
well
its
a
light
bodied
stout
which
is
good
if
you
want
more
then
one
the
flavors
got
much
more
complex
and
better
as
it
got
warmer
i
like
it
good
stout
recommended
nice
light
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
flavor
coats
the
mouth
but
the
beer
isnt
syrupy
very
drinkable
i
really
like
chicory
flavor
reminds
me
of
cafe
dumond
from
new
orleans
the
mouthfeel
is
med
body
not
much
to
it
the
drinkabilty
is
good
to
me
i
like
coffee
stouts
and
this
one
is
low
alcohol
making
it
easy
to
drink
several
in
a
row
this
was
a
really
interesting
beer
full
of
all
kinds
of
unique
flavors
i
read
the
ingredient
list
as
i
was
drinking
it
and
it
contained
mexican
chocolate
coffee
grinds
and
st
johns
wort
i
could
definitely
taste
the
chocolate
and
the
coffee
and
the
bitterness
of
the
st
johns
wort
this
is
a
unique
stout
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
this
stout
was
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
know
maybe
i
expected
more
its
goodnot
great
d
this
is
a
unique
brew
that
is
made
with
chicory
and
st
johns
wort
but
i
would
have
never
known
that
in
a
blind
tasting
it
tastes
like
a
basic
american
stout
with
a
little
more
emphasis
on
coffee
flavor
than
most
and
a
slight
hoppy
kick
the
abv
mouthfeel
and
cascade
hops
make
this
a
very
enjoyable
brew
i
purchased
this
from
camp
lejeune
liquor
store
at
7
99
i
think
they
had
2
or
3
more
6ers
d
easy
drinking
the
coffeechicory
combo
is
interesting
but
the
end
result
is
nothing
special
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
stout
that
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
in
color
with
a
hint
of
light
coming
through
which
revealed
a
deep
red
color
tall
frothy
dark
tan
head
which
slowly
dissipates
smells
of
coffee
and
chicory
with
small
amounts
of
chocolate
and
licorice
tasted
very
strong
coffee
and
the
roasted
chicory
which
comes
off
stronger
than
coffee
itself
hints
of
sweet
chocolate
with
the
smoky
roasted
flavor
sticking
around
very
well
carbonated
which
helps
spread
the
flavor
and
lets
it
flow
through
your
mouth
smoothly
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
didnt
taste
as
strong
as
i
had
expected
but
a
great
one
to
keep
coming
back
to
d
a
very
drinkable
stout
i
found
that
i
drained
the
glass
rather
quickly
over
all
i
highly
recommend
this
one
to
any
coffee
lover
d
this
stout
has
a
great
flavor
as
far
as
price
and
taste
and
availability
go
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
had
im
not
entirely
sure
what
chicory
is
or
what
it
tastes
like
but
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
this
one
my
first

enjoyable
and
satisfying
pours
clear

with

despite
a

the
beer
smells
of

burnt

with

from
the

perhaps
a
touch

notes
light
and
highly
carbonated

rather
drinkable
but
a
bit
unlovely
and
hardly
a
proper
stout
tried
this
on
tap
for
the
first
time
at
the
tap
house
in
md
and
they
served
this
a
tad
too
cold
also
litte
head
or
lacings
but
a
dark
thicklike
black
body
the
coffee
malts
really
hit
the
nostrils
and
there
are
little
hints
of
cocoa
and
nuts
a
very
smooth

stout
for
a
beer
a

spicy
and
warming

not

i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
couple
here
and
then
not
bad
for
what
being
listed
as
the
winter
seasonal
fun
so
dark
real
nice
carbonation
although
little
head
no
typical
dry
stout
bittering
at
the
end
at
all
smells
like
a
nice
coffee
brew
and
tastes
great
i
used
to
drink
chicory
coffee
so
this
was
a
nice
brew
to
find
you
can
best
taste
the
chicory
tones
at
the
aftertaste
i
like
this
one
a
lot
probably
the
best
java
stout
ive
had
thus
far
i
would
consider
this
beer
a
good
choice
for
those
who
like
breakfast
for
dinneror
breakfast
for
breakfast
maybe
some
bacon
side
of
grits
and
biscuits
and
gravy
really
nice
d
very
drinkable
would
not
make
a
bad
session
beer
which
is
weird
considering
the
style
and
how
big
the
taste
is
very
dogfish
overall
not
a
bad
coffee
stout
i
would
probably
grab
a
bells
product
first
give
it
a
try
d
quite
drinkable
for
a
coffee
stout
aromas
and
flavors
are
much
more
subtle
than
say
founders
breakfast
stout
resulting
in
a
more
accessible
brew
this
is
one
of
the
first
stouts
ive
sampled
and
so
i
cant
really
compare
this
to
other
varieties
however
i
was
a
bit
surprised
by
how
thin
this
beer
tasted
based
on
the
color
in
a
glass
this
beer
is
solid
black
with
a
little
bit
of
amber
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
thick
and
grayish
tan
in
color
the
scent
smells
exactly
like
roasted
coffee
beans
there
are
notes
of
smoke
and
charcoal
as
well
as
a
dark
chocolate
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
this
beer
tastes
like
carbonated
espresso
with
its
signature
bitter
finish
this
flavor
is
not
altogether
unpleasant
but
to
me
it
was
not
very
drinkable
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
one
again
but
it
might
work
as
an
post
dessert
beer
to
conclude
the
evening
slides
out
of
the
bottle
like
light
olive
oil
yields
sizable
foam
from
regular
pour
white
faintly
tan
head
like
snow
atop
a
ebony
mountain
exits
in
a
hurry
and
leaves
no
lacing
whatsoever
coal
black
even
in
direct
light
nose
is
coffee
wcream
and
general
roastyness
grains
chocolate
coffee
flavors
up
front
oily
yet
somehow
crispy
mouthfeel
no
detectable
hop
presence
an
odd
combo
of
flavors
afoot
that
bewilder
and
gratify
the
taste
buds
finishes
with
faintly
acidic
medicinal
black
coffee
bitterness
in
an
abrupt
finish
that
begs
for
another
sip
easy
drinking
another
wholly
unique
brew
from
dfh
d
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
would
love
to
have
this
on
tap
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
but
honestly
its
a
stout
so
how
much
can
you
really
drink
at
one
sitting
itd
make
a
great
session
brew
to
share
with
friends
drinkability
ehhh
soso
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
this
has
got
to
be
my
least
favorite
dfh
i
have
tried
it
might
be
easy
to
drink
but
why
would
you
when
there
are
so
many
other
great
stouts
out
there
if
this
beer
had
a
bigger
body
a
bigger
flavor
it
would
be
a
lot
better
i
wont
turn
one
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
i
wont
be
searching
this
one
out
again
d
bitterness
from
finish
isnt
as
persistent
as
smoky
coffee
flavors
are
i
enjoy
this
not
the
best
coffee
stout
but
easier
to
drink
than
most
and
unique
enough
that
i
enjoy
when
i
want
something
lighter
in
comparison
i
think
i
actually
enjoy
the
aftertaste
more
than
the
actual
beer
itself
ill
give
dfh
a
lot
of
credit
for
coming
up
with
something
unique
without
doing
the
whole
20abv
and
400ibu
thing
this
one
could
be
considered
a
session
stout
as
well
recommended
it
pours
a
deep
beautiful
black
capped
with
a
cocoa
powder
colored
head
it
leaves
a
nice
lacing
in
the
glass
roast
coffee
beans
in
the
nose
flavors
of
roasted
malt
coffee
with
a
tinge
of
bitter
chocolate
also
some
smoke
smooth
and
creamy
very
drinkable
i
believe
this
would
be
unbelievably
good
cask
draw
overall
another
winner
from
the
guys
at
dogfish
head
chicory
pours
an
impenetrable
black
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
dissipates
fast
though
the
nose
is
very
coffee
and
wood
filled
the
first
tastes
are
clearly
of
coffee
and
some
earthy
woody
flavors
there
is
slight
vanilla
and
a
little
bit
of
a
smoky
flavor
in
the
middle
the
finish
has
a
slight
hop
bite
but
could
be
better
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
slightly
overcarbonated
imo
in
the
words
of
the
beer
nuts
guinea
pig
its
tickly
quite
drinkable
would
be
a
good
breakfast
stout
this
is
a
fantastic
tasting
stout
its
refreshing
to
have
a
dogfish
head
that
doesnt
try
to
whack
you
over
the
head
those
beers
are
nice
but
its
this
type
of
beer
that
proves
what
a
brewery
is
made
of
as
expected
dfh
passes
with
flying
colors
the
smoky
sweetness
mixes
perfectly
with
the
bitter
coffee
bean
and
subtle
hop
inflection
unfortunately
the
mouth
was
just
a
bit
too
thin
and
too
carbonated
for
my
liking
it
improved
as
the
beer
warmed
but
seemed
a
tad
watery
for
this
type
still
i
could
drink
this
all
night
a
quality
brew
from
dfh
even
if
its
not
a
crazy
high
abv
big
fan
of
dog
fish
head
but
this
is
one
of
their
weaker
products
literally
as
good
as
the
world
wide
stout
is
this
one
is
just
fair
at
best
this
beer
has
great
color
a
great
smell
but
is
way
too
watery
and
thin
for
my
liking
from
a
stout
yet
another
winner
from
dogfish
head
it
pours
an
opaque
sable
with
a
very
thick
tan
head
aroma
is
not
strong
but
stouty
smoky
and
with
a
strong
coffee
undertone
flavor
is
smooth
smoky
with
a
good
tang
and
hints
of
molasses
and
coffee
finish
is
pleasant
coffeelike
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
d
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
good
roasted
taste
and
aftertaste
with
a
near
perfect
mouthfeel
definitely
a
good
example
of
a
stout
d
definitely
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
or
from
the
brewery
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
an
evening
though
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
spectacular
and
a
little
below
the
other
offerings
from
dfh
still
worth
a
try
have
never
really
found
this
to
be
my
thing
have
not
had
it
for
5
years
or
more
so
decided
to
try
a
six
pack
again
deep
dark
brown
colornot
quite
black
small
cocoa
colored
head
moderate
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
a
slight
coffee
tinge
somewhat
vague
flavorok
roasted
taste
a
hint
of
chicorysort
of
mocha
like
slightly
burnt
bite
in
the
finish
average
bodysort
of
thin
for
a
stout
pretty
average
all
around
for
me
some
dfh
beers
i
loveothers
i
just
cant
get
my
liver
wrapped
around
this
is
the
latter
drinkability
the
slight
twinge
of
astringency
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
i
would
prefer
to
have
more
sweetness
this
beer
is
not
bad
its
just
not
great
in
my
humble
opinion
i
like
it
it
definitely
fits
the
bill
for
a
smooth
easydrinking
stout
but
could
use
a
little
more
flavor
to
put
it
over
the
top
pours
the
standard
american
stout
black
with
a
light
brown
head
but
not
much
of
one
it
rises
to
about
a
finger
and
diminishes
in
seconds
to
a
ring
fairly
weak
aroma
not
as
pungent
as
id
expect
but
some
faint
darkroasted
coffee
notes
and
not
a
lot
else
taste
is
a
vapor
of
coffeechicory
beans
wafting
from
the
mouth
to
the
nose
with
some
astringency
in
the
finish
that
tastes
similar
to
the
bottom
of
a
cup
of
maxwell
house
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
on
the
palate
as
well
with
a
moderately
creamy
undertaste
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
and
watery
an
easy
drinker
at
5
2
but
really
who
wants
to
nothing
terrible
but
certainly
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
taste
is
charred
meat
extremely
roasty
chicory
smoky
malty
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
balance
everything
out
finishes
pretty
dry
perhaps
a
little
too
carbonated
for
the
style
this
would
go
great
with
any
bbq
dish
enjoyable
pours
almost
a
jet
black
color
with
a
light
tan
thick
head
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
coffee
malt
and
chocolate
tastes
very
burnt
in
a
good
way
of
course
definitely
notice
the
roasted
chicory
it
has
a
medium
body
and
a
good
finish
nice
beer
and
very
drinkable
d
what
it
loses
in
mouthfeel
it
makes
up
for
in
drinkability
mainly
due
to
the
creamy
texture
and
sweetness
mentioned
above
its
low
for
dogfish
alcohol
by
volume
also
makes
this
a
great
homework
beer
a
beer
i
can
easily
enjoy
in
moderation
while
studying
or
taking
care
of
other
responsibilities
around
the
house
nice
different
well
done
a
stout
i
will
definitely
try
again
the
first
thing
noticed
in
the
flavor
is
coffee
and
a
roasted
malt
tinge
but
with
things
like
st
johns
wort
and
liquorice
root
added
to
the
brewing
process
its
not
the
usual
things
expected
in
a
stouts
taste
neither
of
them
stand
out
in
front
but
along
with
the
chicory
bring
interesting
balance
between
bitter
and
sweet
this
medium
bodied
brewed
finishes
dry
which
is
where
the
cascade
hops
and
chicory
really
shine
through
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
dark
tan
two
finger
head
with
a
nice
layered
lace
to
the
finish
strong
sweet
aromas
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
sweet
roasted
malt
up
front
turning
to
burnt
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
ending
with
a
chicory
after
taste
thick
smooth
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
that
holds
and
does
not
fade
away
great
beer
but
a
little
to
rich
for
a
session
beer
for
me
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
ive
also
had
it
on
tap
and
its
even
better
if
you
get
a
chance
to
go
to
the
brewery
go
and
drink
all
you
can
drinkability
its
pretty
heavy
so
only
one
at
al
time
for
me
definitely
recommended
will
seek
this
one
out
again
nice
one
dh
overall
this
is
a
very
sweet
creamy
enjoyable
stout
however
it
is
just
average
to
me
i
am
used
to
dfh
going
overboard
and
pushing
the
envelope
a
little
more
than
this
for
that
reason
it
is
a
little
bit
of
a
letdown
for
me
this
brew
they
made
on
the
conservative
side
which
makes
it
an
average
stout
to
me
nice
offering
but
i
really
wish
they
would
have
pushed
it
a
little
more
d
a
run
of
the
mill
stout
with
an
interesting
twist
im
not
sure
about
session
beer
although
5
2
would
allow
you
to
have
a
few
would
make
an
amazing
hangover
brew
i
could
see
it
being
absolutely
perfect
with
some
fried
eggs
maple
links
and
garbage
plate
hash
browns
i
should
do
some
research
and
find
out
if
this
is
true
p
d
could
drink
this
all
day
long
really
and
by
all
means
why
not
start
every
day
off
with
one
as
you
get
the
coffeechicory
flavor
with
it
too
m
one
knock
would
be
an
over
carbonated
but
i
can
live
with
it
i
want
to
drink
these
all
the
time
i
think
but
the
price
might
prevent
that
from
happening
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
black
as
molassess
with
a
thick
nice
tan
head
chcolate
head
the
smell
was
of
roasted
coffe
or
burnt
nuts
the
taste
was
thich
but
just
wonderfully
balanced
between
a
coffee
stout
and
a
hard
porter
i
really
like
this
beer
and
will
buy
again
soon
i
hope
the
dark
brown
body
was
capped
by
a
three
finger
thick
head
the
smell
was
coffee
like
as
expected
since
chicory
is
often
used
as
a
filler
in
coffee
the
taste
was
much
different
than
the
smell
suggested
there
was
a
roasty
bitterness
here
but
it
was
quite
subdued
and
was
matched
by
a
chocolate
sweetness
quite
light
on
the
palette
for
the
style
and
soft
in
texture
easy
drinking
and
approachable
but
had
it
been
a
little
stronger
it
would
have
been
far
more
memorable
d
an
enjoyable
stout
but
by
no
means
amazing
id
have
another
in
a
session
might
as
well
give
it
a
shot
if
you
havent
d
not
a
horrible
stout
but
expected
more
probably
would
recommend
to
someone
as
a
beginner
stout
hope
to
find
chicory
stout
where
smell
and
taste
come
through
a
little
stronger
served
in
my
maudite
tulip
bottled
on
10262007
poured
with
a
tan
colored
head
that
dissipated
into
a
thin
skim
with
a
ring
of
foam
lingering
around
the
perimeter
of
the
glass
color
was
a
dark
opaque
brown
almost
black
with
red
highlights
in
the
light
presented
with
a
smell
of
malt
and
coffee
upon
opening
once
poured
released
a
subtle
smell
of
chocolate
coffee
was
somewhat
masked
by
an
earthysmoky
flavor
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
watery
with
a
little
bit
of
astringency
although
not
really
due
to
the
alcohol
content
drinkability
was
average
at
best
better
representations
of
the
style
out
there
this
looked
interestinghow
can
they
take
garbage
and
make
a
good
garbage
stout
out
of
it
chicory
is
nasty
stuff
they
couldnt
the
beer
was
thin
and
offensive
like
when
i
roast
my
coffee
beans
past
dark
and
brew
charcoal
espresso
none
of
the
good
in
fact
its
hard
to
find
the
decent
stout
buried
under
the
additions
at
least
it
isnt
vanilla
flavored
drinkability
overall
this
isnt
the
best
stout
ive
had
but
it
is
interesting
seems
that
some
of
the
flavors
dont
meld
well
together
although
thats
not
the
worst
part
the
mouthfeel
is
way
to
thin
and
just
horrible
for
a
stout
worth
a
try
but
dont
be
expecting
a
world
class
coffee
stout
md
good
full
creamy
body
drinkability
is
pretty
good
on
this
as
it
is
just
a
solid
brew
through
out
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
in
my
opinion
and
one
that
i
could
sip
or
pound
depending
on
the
occassion
this
beer
poured
a
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
creamy
twofinger
tan
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
it
smells
a
bit
like
coffee
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
definitely
very
coffeelike
although
im
not
sure
if
thats
the
chicory
or
the
organic
mexican
coffee
there
is
also
a
bit
of
chocolate
taste
and
some
roasted
maltiness
either
way
its
really
quite
tasty
and
im
surprised
there
isnt
as
much
hops
bite
as
i
expected
its
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
and
the
mouthfeel
almost
feels
like
a
soda
this
is
a
good
beer
and
is
definitely
a
step
away
from
the
norm
d
this
is
a
great
stout
and
one
of
my
favorite
dfh
seasonals
its
tasty
and
sessionable
if
you
like
stouts
you
will
have
to
agree
and
find
this
one
a
winner
pours
a
black
color
with
a
little
brownish
hue
when
its
first
poured
a
large
2
inch
light
brown
head
rests
on
top
and
dies
down
slowly
leaving
a
thin
layer
on
top
with
plenty
of
bubbles
smell
is
doughy
with
a
creamy
cup
of
coffee
aroma
and
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
like
a
creamy
cup
of
coffee
and
a
punch
of
a
bitterness
right
at
the
very
end
creamy
mouthfeeling
that
lingers
with
the
bitter
coffee
taste
pours
black
tinged
with
brown
and
with
a
nice
initial
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
and
ring
some
okay
lacing
the
smell
is
dry
and
roastywith
dark
roasted
coffee
and
a
light
herbal
bitterness
the
taste
is
similar
but
deeper
than
the
aromas
deep
dry
roasted
notes
herbal
and
coffee
bitterness
and
a
piney
note
are
all
there
mouthfeel
is
chewy
but
not
big
nor
particularly
creamy
instead
its
very
dry
pretty
tasty
the
chicory
lends
a
note
of
nutttiness
and
the
hops
are
a
little
more
present
than
in
other
coffee
stouts
those
qqualities
combined
with
the
drynesss
make
this
one
a
little
diffferent
and
probably
more
suitable
as
a
companion
to
many
savory
dishes
nice
purchased
a
case
to
bring
on
home
with
me
good
stuff
look
forward
to
enjoying
with
variety
of
desserts
odd
at
first
following
the
world
wide
but
a
nice
match
in
hitting
a
variety
of
stouts
this
reminds
me
of
a
lower
alcohol
version
of
worldwide
stout
rich
and
roasty
like
a
stout
should
be
i
first
purchased
this
stout
on
a
suggestion
from
my
brother
purchased
in
6
pack
bottles
dark
smoky
appearance
small
head
which
disappeared
as
the
glass
emptied
good
aroma
and
very
good
flavor
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
when
i
am
able
to
find
it
locally
dead
black
beer
with
some
lighter
brown
highlights
around
the
edges
one
finger
of
tan
head
that
dissolves
down
to
a
thin
tan
film
aromas
are
nice
lots
of
roasted
malt
light
coffee
not
too
complex
but
tasty
flavor
is
strong
on
coffee
malt
up
front
very
light
dried
fruit
light
sourness
and
a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
stronger
brown
sugar
flavor
shows
up
as
the
beer
warms
fairly
full
body
solid
carbonation
overall
this
ones
tasty
a
solid
stout
another
good
effort
from
dh
d
heavy
feeling
only
for
exp
stomach
stout
or
dark
coffee
fellow
complex
interesting
drinkable
nice
stout
maybe
nice
isnt
good
enough
exceptionally
good
stout
remember
i
had
it
on
tap
my
palate
is
alway
a
bit
happier
with
draft
beer
pours
jet
black
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
a
sweet
malt
and
coffee
in
the
taste
coffee
sweet
malt
and
the
alcohol
is
present
here
i
know
it
isnt
that
strong
but
it
is
in
here
in
the
mouthfeel
big
on
the
palate
with
a
sweet
coffee
aftertaste
and
small
hop
end
too
i
think
the
coffee
gives
the
a
special
something
thanks
to
the
bartenders
at
dfh
brewing
and
eats
add
a
shot
of
dfh
vanilla
vodka
to
it
flavors
are
incredible
d
it
is
a
decent
stout
i
wouldnt
go
after
it
but
if
i
happen
to
run
into
another
bottle
i
wouldnt
mind
it
the
taste
is
of
caramel
and
roasted
malt
some
vanilla
and
woody
notes
further
sips
give
me
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
wee
bit
of
fruit
and
sharp
bitterness
just
before
the
finish
and
the
finish
itself
is
semi
sweet
this
is
a
good
taster
and
easy
to
drink
and
it
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
the
carbo
is
light
all
in
all
a
solid
american
stout
that
should
please
most
palates
d
quite
drinkable
i
enjoyed
that
quite
a
bit
more
refreshing
than
the
thick
heavy
stouts
im
used
to
pretty
drinkable
and
overall
an
above
average
stout
for
being
a
dfh
brew
this
is
pretty
tame
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
and
falls
neatly
into
the
style
d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
very
flavorful
would
get
this
again
for
sure
d
pleasant
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
it
lacks
the
thickness
that
i
associate
with
a
really
great
stout
but
that
allows
it
to
be
more
refreshing
and
easier
to
drink
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
stout
and
utterly
sessionable
medium
body
on
this
one
slick
almost
watery
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
astringent
prickly
carbonated
finish
flavors
are
a
muddled
mix
between
soft
spoken
bakers
chocolate
notes
coffee
and
other
toasted
malt
notes
flavors
are
almost
an
afterthought
following
the
initial
bath
of
bitterness
drinkability
is
ok
but
mostly
because
of
the
minimal
mouthfeel
i
was
expecting
more
from
a
dfh
product
certainly
not
bad
but
quite
average
for
a
stout
d
pretty
good
i
could
drink
a
couple
but
then
i
would
have
to
switch
to
something
a
little
hoppier
served
to
me
in
a
standard
pint
glass
its
deep
black
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
fades
away
leaving
mild
lacing
nose
is
malts
and
chocolate
taste
is
a
bit
more
complex
with
heavy
malts
but
also
some
black
licorice
and
coffee
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
decent
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
little
fizzy
tannish
head
some
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
smoky
malty
and
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
smoked
nice
touch
of
caramel
with
a
nice
bitterdry
finish
medium
body
drinkable
i
like
this
one
true
to
style
brew
poured
black
with
a
small
brownish
head
it
smelled
sweet
and
had
a
roasted
barley
and
coffee
aroma
it
has
a
coffee
licorice
and
smoky
chocolate
flavor
this
is
a
really
smooth
stout
it
is
well
balanced
and
i
could
definitely
sit
down
and
drink
a
handful
of
these
overall
i
love
dfh
brews
but
ill
have
to
pass
on
this
one
cheers
dogfish
has
some
pretty
amazing
beers
this
one
goes
down
just
as
well
as
their
other
ones
only
it
does
not
seem
so
over
the
top
as
many
of
their
beers
can
be
this
one
is
more
down
to
earth
and
sets
a
tone
in
the
stout
style
it
actually
fits
the
style
great
mouthfeel
roasty
aroma
and
good
lacing
in
my
glass
the
head
is
darker
than
white
as
the
other
reviewer
noted
not
sure
why
they
say
that
either
im
glad
i
got
a
case
of
this
stout
lovers
will
not
be
disappointed
with
this
one
very
drinkable
recommended
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
im
not
sure
why
dogfish
says
the
head
is
bonewhite
on
the
bottle
smells
like
roasted
meat
malt
and
maple
sugar
and
a
little
yeast
taste
is
nice
and
roasted
but
not
bitter
at
all
really
suprised
at
how
mellow
this
stout
was
everything
was
well
balanced
and
the
taste
is
deeply
roasted
and
sweet
without
any
of
the
acrid
taste
you
sometimes
associate
with
stouts
has
a
great
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
three
in
a
row
no
problem
in
general
a
wonderful
beer
and
surprising
stout
poured
black
with
ruby
hints
and
a
minimal
14
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
just
a
sporadic
coating
with
next
to
no
lacing
smells
of
roasty
sweet
malts
and
slight
bitterness
tastes
nice
and
matly
upfront
deep
roasted
malts
with
some
coffee
and
accompanying
bitterness
finish
is
somewhat
lackluster
and
lacks
the
intensity
of
flavors
that
i
initially
experienced
mouthfeel
is
ok
body
was
fairly
thin
for
the
style
drinkability
was
fairly
good
this
is
a
nice
easydrinking
stout
but
the
beers
weak
finish
detracts
a
bit
this
beer
practically
oozed
out
of
the
bottle

thick
black
with
a
small
creamy
head
the
initial
aroma
is
sweet
with
a
hint
of
smoke
the
taste
is
malty
with
the
coffee
flavor
quite
apparent
the
flavors
blend
well
in
this
and
create
a
smooth
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
a
bit
chewy
this
is
a
really
nice
stout
very
dark
in
color
blackishbrown
in
appearance
smell
is
of
strong
roasted
malts
very
coffee
like
with
a
low
hop
smell
medium
bitterness
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
no
aftertaste
smooth
going
down
a
very
thin
light
brown
head
with
very
light
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
good
in
overall
drinkability
one
of
the
better
stouts
available
will
drink
this
one
again
good
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
moderate
alcohol
level
makes
it
higher
than
some
other
stouts
but
still
low
enough
to
drink
several
in
an
evening
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
deep
dark
brown
color
letting
the
faintest
beam
of
light
pass
through
there
is
a
good
inch
of
dark
tan
colored
head
that
lingers
for
a
few
minutes
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
of
roasted
caramel
malts
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
a
wisp
of
smoke
tastes
of
roasted
coffee
beans
bittersweet
cocoa
and
a
mild
raisin
note
a
notch
or
two
below
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
a
delicious
stout
but
im
not
really
seeing
how
the
chicory
benefits
it
or
stands
out
it
adds
a
little
bit
of
a
coffeeearthy
complexity
i
guess
pretty
interesting
and
drinkable
12oz
brown
bottle
bottled
4202006
purchased
accidently
as
part
of
a
six
pack
of
60
minute
ipa
but
i
figured
id
take
this
oportunity
to
review
it
instead
of
returning
it
as
its
being
discontinued
dark
brownblack
body
with
slight
rubyred
highlights
and
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
smells
like
toasty
malt
and
coffee
tastes
like
burnt
malt
chicory
and
coffee
in
pretty
much
equal
parts
fuller
in
body
i
like
it
better
than
i
remember
though
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
porter
than
a
stout
but
im
not
sure
im
so
keen
on
the
addition
of
chicory
doesnt
mesh
with
the
other
flavors
as
well
as
it
could
imo
good
stout
but
not
the
best
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
dark
like
black
coffee
i
hesitate
to
say
pitch
black
because
there
is
some
light
shining
through
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
head
is
huge
maybe
from
a
poor
pour
the
head
also
sticks
around
for
a
long
time
and
is
sticking
all
over
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
big
on
coffee
chocolate
is
there
too
but
subdued
not
much
to
it
actually
taste
is
nice
and
roasty
lots
of
coffee
chocolate
maybe
a
little
hop
bite
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thintoo
carbonated
needs
more
creaminess
this
is
tasty
but
nothing
special
i
come
to
expect
more
from
dogfish
not
bad
by
any
means
recommended
another
winner
from
dfh
cant
believe
ive
ignored
this
one
for
so
long
d
probably
not
one
ill
get
again
bland
and
boring
for
the
stout
style
with
an
underwhelming
use
of
coffee
bean
adjuncts
i
only
question
whether
freshness
was
an
issue
reagardless
the
one
i
tried
did
nothing
for
me
and
is
not
a
beer
id
recommend
which
is
too
bad
because
dfh
is
a
brewery
i
respect
and
typically
enjoy
what
ive
had
of
theirs
mouthfeel
is
good
and
fits
this
beerstyle
drinkability
is
also
good
cheers
d
a
very
drinkable
delicious
stout
with
few
areas
to
improve
upon
a
decent
looking
beer
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
coffee
black
with
a
small
tanbrown
head
that
fades
very
quickly
which
laces
throughout
the
drink
smells
of
chocolate
and
nuts
tastes
malty
with
light
chocolate
some
nutty
taste
lots
of
malt
and
some
coffee
a
nice
little
stout
a
nice
little
change
from
my
usual
london
porter
easy
to
drink
after
dinner
found
this
to
be
a
pedestrian
offering
by
dogfish
head
boring
poured
dark
mahogney
with
nice
head
little
taste
up
front
little
in
the
middle
or
behind
slightly
silky
mouthfeel
but
this
stout
has
nothing
interesting
about
it
and
nothing
going
for
it
boring
never
again
thanks
for
another
good
dfh
brew
muenchenerkindl
this
is
a
fine
stout
by
a
fine
brewer
the
dogfish
uses
the
chicory
to
perk
up
this
stout
in
my
mind
it
is
like
a
beefed
up
coffee
porter
but
who
cares
it
is
creamy
and
rich
not
a
beer
you
would
have
on
a
warm
day
it
is
a
little
heavy
for
mowing
the
lawn
but
makes
a
nice
winter
warmer
d
this
beer
is
an
interesting
concept
but
it
is
pretty
one
dimensional
in
flavor
pulls
in
tastes
from
a
bunch
of
different
directions
a
fun
beer
drinkability
was
moderate
the
viscosity
made
this
an
easydrinking
beer
but
the
moderately
bitter
taste
and
disappointing
finish
made
for
a
less
than
ideal
drinking
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
spritzy
in
the
beginning
but
the
flavors
kick
in
though
i
would
expect
richness
from
a
stout
its
not
a
rich
beer
it
is
however
definitely
a
stout
and
does
boast
some
sweetness
tasty
but
not
terribly
distinctive
dark
amber
cola
brown
with
only
slivers
of
light
around
the
edges
solid
frosting
of
cocoa
brown
head
looks
like
it
wants
to
stick
around
fine
by
me

towards

residue
with
maybe
licorice
and
tobacco
in
the

overall
a
little
tarter
than
i
like
think
raspberry
dark
chocolate
mediumbodied
smooth
feel
better
than
i
remember
its
been
a
couple
years
but
not
overwhelming
or
phenomenol
poured
a
very
dark
brown
could
barely
see
through
it
when
held
up
to
the
light
light
tan
head
that
seemed
to
disappear
quickly
felt
slightly
syrupy
in
the
mouth
but
not
overly
thick
first
obvious
flavor
is
the
coffee
although
it
was
less
mild
than
the
smell
lead
me
to
expect
slight
taste
of
chocolate
as
well
maybe
it
was
me
but
the
flavors
seemed
to
get
stronger
as
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
im
not
a
big
stout
drinker
but
this
went
down
fairly
easily
not
a
bad
choice
for
the
coffee
lover
cheers
despite
all
complaints
its
a
nice
beer
and
very
drinkable
id
happily
enjoy
it
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
dry
stout
or
porter
even
if
i
wouldnt
make
it
a
fridge
regular
da
nice
drinker
kinda
lowish
on
the
abv
so
i
could
probably
session
it
drinkable
nope
not
for
me
it
is
to
weird
tasting
pours
deep
dark
black
with
a
small
light
tan
lace
aroma
is
somewhat
bready
very
dark
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
fresh
brewed
coffee
the
coffee
really
dominates
the
taste
as
well
taste
starts
of
with
roasted
coffee
flavors
that
make
way
for
small
subtle
wave
of
sweetness
that
finishes
with
an
almost
out
of
place
bitterness
mouthfeel
lacks
in
overall
depth
and
body
overall
this
is
a
decent
stout
that
ultimately
lacks
in
balance
and
depth
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
rushing
out
to
get
more
pours
a
deep
pitch
black
with
very
subtle
red
hues
around
the
edges
moderate
layer
of
cashew
colored
foam
rests
on
top
which
eventually
settles
to
nothing
more
than
a
ring
around
the
glass
coffee
sweetened
with
dark
fruit
in
the
nose
taste
is
a
sharp
yet
light
coffee
and
molasses
at
the
start
with
the
earthy
chicory
coming
out
in
the
finish
some
chocolate
in
there
somewhere
too
mouthfeel
is
odd
its
a
bit
chunky
but
smoothes
out
to
an
easy
drinker
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
one
of
dfhs
better
offerings
in
my
opinion
its
good
and
oddly
refreshing
but
i
would
probably
opt
for
over
stouts
given
the
chance
in
the
future
its
just
too
toned
down
drinkability
an
appealing
concept
but
this
brew
just
isnt
for
me
i
guess
poured
in
to
a
glass
pours
easily
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
disppeared
quickly
dark
rich
amber
almost
light
coffee
color
smells
of
a
rich
roast
coffee
beans
mouthfeel
average
not
too
thick
for
a
stout
flavor
good
smooth
stout
hint
of
chicory
then
finish
with
a
hint
of
a
roasted
strong
coffee
somewhat
dry
finish
overall
very
good
though
im
used
to
huge
stouts
so
when
i
was
ready
for
the
next
level
of
flavor
to
hit
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
would
be
perfectly
happy
having
this
with
a
good
dessert
as
its
not
overpowering
just
right
poured
into
british
pint
glass
one
inch
creamy
head
developed
at
the
top
but
dissipated
fairly
quickly
as
i
drank
the
smell
is
of
coffee
malt
taste
is
great
with
toffee
and
coffee
notes
went
well
with
a
blueberry
crisp
and
vanilla
icecream
that
i
had
with
it
the
mouthfeel
was
great
not
too
much
carbonation
and
very
smoot
overall
this
is
an
excellent
stout
a
very
rich
brew
with
lots
of
flavor
i
would
think
of
this
more
as
a
desert
beer
rather
than
something
id
want
to
session
a
great
flavoured
stout
what
i
enjoy
most
about
it
is
that
the
coffee
flavour
doesnt
dominate
the
beer
like
many
other
coffee
flavoured
beers
many
of
the
others
ive
found
you
can
only
taste
the
coffee
beans
its
like
a
cold
coffee
rather
than
beer
this
on
the
other
hand
i
find
has
the
coffee
contribute
to
the
beer
and
lend
it
a
nice
blended
flavour
that
maintains
its
beer
intergrity
aroma
is
a
little
meak
but
overall
this
beer
is
excellent
this
would
be
great
as
a
standard
stout
of
choice
the
mouth
is
mediumbodied
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
nor
as
complex
its
dry
and
grainy
on
the
finish
overall
it
was
decent
but
not
as
well
balanced
or
as
bold
as
i
would
have
liked
i
am
from
new
orleans
and
chicory
is
commonly
used
in
our
coffee
down
here
chicory
is
a
root
that
when
grinded
down
into
powder
is
added
to
coffee
for
its
bitterness
and
preservative
qualities
i
have
always
been
impressed
with
dog
fish
head
and
when
i
saw
that
they
had
a
chicory
stout
i
just
had
to
try
the
beer
i
had
this
one
out
of
a
12oz
bottle
and
it
pours
near
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
the
taste
is
wonderful
and
has
a
coffeeespresso
note
i
found
that
this
beer
improves
in
flavor
and
drinkability
as
it
warms
up
a
little
i
recommend
taking
one
out
of
the
fridge
about
510
minutes
before
drinking
so
that
it
is
not
as
cold
when
served
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
stout
and
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
the
only
reason
that
i
rated
the
drinkability
as
a
3
5
is
that
i
personally
feel
that
the
unique
flavor
of
this
beer
is
captured
by
drinking
only
one
bottle
one
evening
i
had
two
of
these
in
a
row
and
i
found
by
the
second
bottle
that
the
flavor
was
not
as
enjoyable
overall
a
very
good
and
unique
stout
cheers
d
i
guess
this
style
is
like
a
coffee
stout
but
there
is
a
nice
crispness
here
and
easy
drinkability
with
this
one
at
5
2
abv
i
could
definitely
see
drinking
a
couple
even
though
this
is
not
my
main
session
beer
style
i
like
that
dfh
doesnt
have
to
blow
everyones
mind
to
make
a
good
solid
offering
as
well
i
found
the
texture
to
be
a
little
lean
for
a
stout
perhaps
this
is
more
characteristic
of
the
american
stout
style
the
carbonation
is
just
enough
for
my
taste
petes99
recommended
this
to
me
i
like
it
a
lot
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
stout
maybe
to
those
who
think
guinness
is
a
bit
too
bitter
nice
stout
not
too
bitter
with
a
bit
of
coffee
flavor
not
too
heavy
either
ill
certainly
buy
it
again
nice
work
petes99
pours
with
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
dark
brown
liquid
with
an
ambient
orange
glow
at
the
perimeter
a
sweet
smell
of
vanilla
caramel
and
chocolate
balanced
out
by
the
hint
of
floral
hops
taste
starts
out
with
a
dry
bitterness
ushered
in
by
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
hops
then
moves
towards
buttery
and
ends
up
somewhat
medicinal
with
molasses
and
a
vague
sour
note
in
the
finish
carbonation
is
a
bit
sharp
on
the
palate
a
worthy
session
beer
if
nothing
else
drinkability
its
a
bit
heavier
than
your
garden
variety
pale
lager
but
still
very
drinkable
as
stouts
go
da

abv
this
should
be
a
highly
drinkable
stout
but
it
is
hindered
by
the
sour
and
bitter
dominated
flavor
id
be
good
for
a
bomber
of
this
at
a
time
i
was
fortunate
to
pick
this
case
up
for
under
20
as
it
was
expired
i
say
the
age
did
nothing
but
warm
and
mellow
the
flavors
d
prett
decent
stoutworth
a
try
if
you
can
get
one
not
going
to
blow
you
awaypretty
solid
all
and
all
an
excellent
stout
quite
flavorful
thick
tasting
and
refreshing
worth
a
try
this
beer
is
likable
in
the
moment
but
forgettable
over
the
long
run
i
love
a
good
flavored
stout
but
this
one
does
little
for
me
have
i
become
jaded
would
this
beer
have
rocked
my
world
four
years
ago
i
really
wonder
maybe
all
the
praise
wellderived
of
course
for
dfh
has
skewed
my
reality
of
this
beer
i
dont
think
so
like
ive
said
this
is
a
good
stout
but
it
is
nothing
id
seek
out
sure
id
drink
it
again
but
i
can
say
that
about
thousands
of
beers
average
isnt
charming
nevertheless
i
need
to
thank
either
hoffman
or
redhaze
for
the
bottle
sorry
mates
i
cant
remember
who
gave
it
to
me
both
you
guys
rock
the
unique
and
powerful
flavor
of
this
masterpeice
may
not
appeal
to
everyone
but
for
coffee
and
chocolate
lovers
like
me
this
is
heaven
in
a
bottle
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
slightly
out
of
balanced
maybe
but
good
with
so
many
great
stouts
out
there
i
doubt
i
will
revisit
this
often
but
ill
give
it
another
whirl
down
the
road
i
found
this
one
fairly
disappointing
having
enjoyed
so
many
of
the
other
dogfish
head
beers
that
ive
tried
appearance
is
jetblack
with
a
onefinger
head
that
is
anything
than
the
bone
white
described
on
the
label
definitely
more
tan
in
color
some
lacing
smell
was
weak
at
first
but
improved
as
it
warmed
roasted
coffee
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
smoke
taste
is
predominantly
roasty
little
in
the
way
of
hop
character
with
a
distinctly
smoky
character
that
a
friend
said
reminded
him
of
bacon
not
a
descriptor
you
often
hear
for
beer
as
for
mouthfeel
full
body
and
good
carb
for
style
drinkability
was
moderate
not
a
tremendous
brew
not
very
complex
the
flavours
get
offensive
after
too
long
and
leave
a
ground
coffee
bean
and
grassy
bitterness
in
my
mouth
as
a
reminder
although
it
answered
the
question
what
does
chickory
taste
like
drinkability
a
sessionable
and
enjoyable
stout
it
would
be
nice
to
have
this
available
locally
thanks
to
lrrr
for
the
bottle
from
these

11
bif
chicory
stout
a
rich
dark
brew
smoothed
out
with
a
touch
of
roasted
chicory
and
organic
mexican
coffe
the
goodness
beneath
a
bone
white
head
chicory
is
used
as
a
substitute
ingredient
for
coffee
it
has
been
grown
since
the
middle
ages
and
contains
inulin
which
is
used
as
a
sweetener
and
can
be
converted
to
fructose
and
glucose
i
was
unsure
of
what
to
expect
with
this
one
i
can
however
report
that
i
was
very
pleased
indeed
it
poured
absolutely
black
allowing
no
light
to
pass
through
head
was
about
a
finger
thick
and
lasted
all
of
30
seconds
or
so
after
it
faded
away
it
left
sticky
sand
coloured
lacing
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
looks
wonderful
theres
is
no
question
the
there
is
coffee
present
here
im
not
exactly
sure
what
the
chicory
is
but
there
is
certainly
a
faint
burnt
wood
aspect
to
the
smell
as
well
i
am
very
pleased
so
far
taste
starts
of
with
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
beans
and
then
turns
sweeter
toward
the
middle
it
then
seems
to
finish
rather
abruptly
with
a
certain
dryness
to
it
where
it
deploys
the
burnt
wood
flavour
in
your
mouth
a
bit
light
for
the
style
i
thought
overall
however
quite
good
a
nice
drinking
stout
always
a
good
choice
when
in
the
mood
black
with
an
short
offwhite
head
smells
of
roasted
grains
and
a
bit
of
coffee
the
taste
was
initally
overpoweringly
bitter
i
ventured
further
and
got
more
complexity
out
of
the
bitter
grains
as
well
as
the
coffeechicory
if
youre
looking
for
a
dry
and
bitter
stout
look
no
further
at
a
glance
the
stuff
just
tastes
burnt
but
it
really
is
wonderfully
complex
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
dry
and
has
a
bit
of
a
champagn
feel
drinkability
is
mediumlow
despite
the
average
abv
mainly
because
its
just
so
robust
overall
a
real
nice
stout
not
your
average
stout
normally
i
like
my
dark
beer
strong
and
this
ones
not
but
it
doesnt
matter
the
beer
is
very
dark
in
color
with
a
white
almost
mother
of
pearl
head
the
beer
tingles
as
it
goes
down
it
has
an
almost
champagne
quality
unheard
of
in
a
stout
as
far
as
i
know
it
is
a
bit
spicy
and
has
notes
of
coffee
goes
great
with
a
chocolate
desert
it
is
also
a
very
refreshing
beer
with
a
medium
body
it
goes
down
very
easy
this
is
a
darkhorse
unconventional
stout
as
far
as
im
concerned
try
it
out
as
for
the
chicory
what
the
heck
does
chicory
taste
like
d
not
bad
the
finish
wasnt
the
best
at
first
but
i
probably
didnt
let
it
bloom
enough
before
drinking
the
beer
was
nice
after
it
warmed
a
bit
but
its
still
your
basic
stout
chicory
or
no
but
its
a
cool
rainy
day
in
the
northeast
and
this
did
the
trick
i
like
chicory
in
my
coffee
and
i
wanted
to
like
it
in
my
beer
but
im
not
impressed
the
aroma
offered
more
than
the
flavor
and
the
depreciation
is
notable
and
the
staccato
nature
of
the
flavor
makes
it
a
challenge
to
drink
so
its
not
a
goto
stout
by
any
means
id
drink
it
if
given
one
but
im
not
going
to
buy
it
again
i
dont
know
if
its
the
chicory
but
this
one
is
just
better
than
mediocre
and
i
want
better
than
that
from
dfh
huge
thick
body
like
a
grade
a
amber
maple
syrup
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
smooth
creamy
sweet
start
bitter
finish
while
the
roasted
coffee
notes
stand
out
not
a
bad
beer
i
love
stouts
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
still
its
a
decent
beer
worth
trying
i
always
feel
that
any
dfh
brew
is
worth
a
try
poured
bottle
into
pint
dark
coffee
color
with
light
colored
head
that
fades
quick
aromas
of
coffee
chocolate
and
malts
that
are
pleasent
to
the
nose
and
well
balanced
taste
was
rich
and
smooth
creamy
texture
couldnt
see
my
self
drinking
alot
of
these
due
to
heaviness
of
stouts
but
this
one
was
the
first
of
dogfish
head
brewerys
long
list
of
beers
that
i
have
tried
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
d
good
drinkability
tasty
stout
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
touch
of
slickness
this
is
a
stout
that
i
can
drink
more
than
one
of
since
i
dont
really
enjoy
the
strong
coffee
flavors
but
two
would
probably
do
it
for
me
pours
a
dark
roasty
brown
like
coca
cola
with
a
fizzy
tan
head
not
much
retention
as
the
head
quickly
fizzed
away
looked
more
like
a
porter
than
anything
lacks
body
and
mouthfeel
is
dominated
by
over
carbonation
aroma
of
roasted
malts
coffee
and
cringing
sourness
at
the
end
i
didnt
particularly
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
something
is
off
about
this
beer
in
the
aftertaste
not
recommended
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
perceivable
the
off
flavor
that
i
taste
in
the
finish
bothers
me
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
could
use
some
improvements
overall
a
pretty
decent
stout
i
was
hoping
for
more
and
was
slightly
dissapointed
with
it
worth
trying
but
not
a
favorite
this
really
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
stouts
i
have
tasted
in
my
young
beer
tasting
life
medium
body
low
carbonation
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
very
well
balanced
i
think
this
could
be
sessionable
especially
in
the
winter
time
will
definately
have
this
again
d
due
to
the
lightness
of
this
stout
i
would
say
that
you
can
down
a
few
of
these
though
i
dont
know
if
i
would
reccomend
it
its
a
decent
beer
but
really
not
what
i
had
in
mind
for
a
chicory
stout
pours
a
mostly
black
but
not
opaque
color
head
is
short
lived
cappucino
color
aromas
are
rather
bland
for
a
stout
coffee
roasted
malts
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
ripe
fruits
flavors
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
lacking
the
complexity
i
expected
from
dfh
a
fairly
dry
finish
some
bitterness
from
malts
but
nothing
from
hops
come
across
in
terms
of
flavor
my
biggest
problem
is
the
carbonation
level
which
i
found
to
be
way
too
high
this
really
gave
it
too
much
of
a
bite
lightened
the
body
too
much
and
just
ruined
the
beer
drinkability
is
fine
for
a
stout
though
halfway
through
i
was
bored
and
would
not
need
to
try
in
the
future
the
color
at
first
appears
jet
black
yet
somehow
you
can
sense
that
it
is
just
very
deep
mahogony
even
though
holding
it
up
to
a
light
produces
onlly
the
faintest
hints
around
the
corners
head
is
foamy
mocha
colored
and
and
quickly
backs
down
to
a
thin
sheet
with
a
nice
thick
rim
the
smell
is
quite
nice
with
heavy
chocolate
notes
and
rasins
mixed
in
with
the
burnt
malt
and
the
slightest
bit
of
hops
the
taste
reflected
the
smell
somewhat
though
it
seemed
much
flatter
and
a
bit
too
thin
there
was
no
prevailing
flavor
on
the
front
and
the
back
seemed
a
bit
alcoholic
though
it
wasnt
enough
to
consider
it
offensive
the
aftertaste
opened
up
a
bit
with
some
tangy
yet
bitter
malts
seeming
to
come
through
in
the
vapors
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
with
tons
of
pleasant
bubbles
up
front
and
a
beautifully
thick
and
warm
feeling
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
definitely
worth
drinking
though
not
the
best
of
stouts
lightly
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
on
the
flavor
but
again
a
lot
milder
than
other
stouts
this
one
aims
more
for
balance
and
drinkability
than
over
the
top
flavor
which
is
always
a
nice
change
a
good
stout
and
a
very
drinkable
one
pours
the
darkest
of
browns
thin
tan
head
with
decent
lace
aroma

taste
is
of

on
the
light
sidebut
quite
good
evenly
balanced
and
very
refreshing
for
a
stout
another
winner
from
dogfish
head
body
seems
a
bit
thin
and
overall
lackluster
i
was
expecting
much
more
from
this
a
little
disappointing
pours
a
velvety
black
with
some
brown
ink
highlights
a
light
creamy
brown
head
emerges
but
doesnt
last
long
amidst
this
coal
colored
liquid
the
aroma
makes
me
think
of
special
brownies
but
not
your
pothead
friends
special
brownies
like
a
brewers
special
brownies
with
a
whiff
of
espresso
the
taste
gives
more
definetion
to
the
aromas
a
bitter
bakers
chocolate
brownies
mixed
with
herbal
strong
hops
and
a
shot
of
starbucks
liquer
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
black
with
not
much
head
or
lacing
the
smell
was
roasted
malt
coffee
and
slightly
chocolate
taste
was
same
as
smell
with
a
good
smooth
mouthfeel
of
the
dogfish
beers
this
was
what
a
i
expected
a
topnotch
beer
i
was
a
bit
worried
about
the
chickory
because
i
tend
to
not
like
coffee
with
chickory
but
it
worked
well
in
this
beer
a
nice
all
around
beer
and
unique
for
the
style
recommended
as
i
would
any
dogfish
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
nice
white
head
retention
right
up
front
are
aromas
of
iced
coffee
caramel
espresso
very
satisfying
the
coffee
flavors
come
through
in
the
taste
as
well
with
a
slight
hint
of
milk
chocolate
starts
off
very
nice
and
flavorful
yet
still
seems
to
sort
of
fall
on
its
face
towards
the
end
with
not
much
lingering
taste
to
accompany
how
it
starts
on
of
the
high
points
about
this
beer
is
that
even
a
nonstout
lover
could
probably
sip
this
and
enjoy
its
light
to
medium
body
not
bad
by
any
means
a
very
user
friendly
stout
that
is
nice
for
a
quiet
afternoon

brew
not
one
of
their
better
ones
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
the
body
is
a
deep
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
medium
thickness
tan
head
with
very
good
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
some
definite
and
pleasing
notes
of
coffee
and
cocoa
the
taste
was
led
by
the
coffee
notes
and
also
a
sweet
chocolate
balance
the
roasted
malt
backbone
was
also
pleasing
and
had
a
touch
of
hops
to
round
things
out
well
as
the
body
is
kinda
big
this
makes
for
a
good
after
dinner
drink
deep
reddened
black
with
a
thin
creamy
beige
head
sweet
dark
coffee
aroma
smooth
chocolate
malts
burnt
coffee
hops
finishes
with
a
little
sourness
astringency
is
somewhat
disruptive
nice
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
though
its
thinner
than
it
should
be
still
a
good
stout
bottom
line
a
good
stout
from
the
boys
from
delaware
but
not
a
revelation
or
anything
drinkability
nice
for
after
dinner
not
a
session
beer
for
me
this
is
a
perfectly
enjoyable
beer
but
leaves
one
wanting
more
taste
in
the
drink
rather
than
a
general
mild
stoutcoffee
background
of
burnt
notes
not
crazy
about
a
stout
this
carbonated
and
it
leaves
it
somewhat
thin
the
lower
alcohol
makes
it
a
drinkable
type
of
stout
if
you
can
get
past
the
carbo
overall
i
have
had
better
examples
of
stouts
this
is
not
a
bad
example
but
not
my
favorite
either
i
will
probably
have
this
again
on
occassion
and
i
would
reccommend
that
other
try
it
especially
those
that
think
stouts
are
too
dark
thick
and
heavy
did
not
impress
me
at
all
not
bad
from
dfh
but
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
taste
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
come
out
right
away
followed
by
sweet
malts
and
some
nutty
flavors
theres
hardly
any
hop
bitterness
to
this
at
all
id
have
to
say
this
is
a
failry
mellow
but
still
enjoyable
stout
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
that
probably
helps
with
the
drinkability
drinks
okay
but
i
expect
for
from
this
brewery
for
9
a
sixer
not
reccomended
at
this
price
i
enjoyed
this
stout
very
much
a
nice
rich
flavor
that
wasnt
overpowered
by
a
high
abv
overall
a
very
drinkable
stout
and
recommended
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
it
smells
like
roasted
coffee
with
a
hint
of
oatmeal
i
dont
really
know
what
chicory
smells
like
but
i
think
its
similar
to
coffee
after
an
initial
coffee
bitterness
it
tastes
like
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
with
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
it
has
a
lightmedium
mouthfeel
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
it
has
a
good
mixture
of
bitter
and
sweet
to
it
and
its
enjoyable
to
drink
id
recommend
it
to
others
to
drink
its
a
pretty
good
stout
this
is
an
ok
stout
but
i
think
i
prefer
mine
a
little
sweeter
and
more
complex
its
certainly
different
and
a
good
try
for
coffee
lovers
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
stout
it
pours
nearly
a
black
if
not
black
then
very
dark
brown
and
aroma
is
that
of
a
burntroasted
coffee
with
malt
it
goes
down
much
lighter
than
i
expected
but
the
taste
is
refreshing
definitely
mocha
i
think
i
am
used
to
the
higher
abv
from
other
dfh
brews
the
chicory
stout
is
refreshing
and
while
its
not
in
my
top
10
american
stouts
id
pick
one
up
again
dogfish
head
chicory
stout
pours
an
almost
jet
black
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
ruby
at
the
edges
and
has
a
tan
head
coffee
like
aromas
emit
from
the
glass
taste
is
also
very
coffee
like
ive
never
had
chicory
before
but
i
am
aware
that
it
was
used
as
a
substitute
for
coffee
aftertaste
is
a
little
funky
for
a
second
or
two
but
not
enough
to
bother
me
i
like
this
beer
i
generally
like
coffee
like
flavors
in
stouts
well
worth
trying
enjoy
this
one
cheers
d
chicory
stout
isnt
amazing
but
it
is
enjoyable
a
light
refreshing
stout
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
i
have
had
it
before
and
likely
will
have
it
again
very
dark
rather
dark
head
that
started
big
but
dwindled
away
little
lace
on
the
way
down
flavor
was
a
touch
thin
but
was
still
drinkable
different
flavors
smokey
somewhat
nutty
a
little
coffee
maybe
a
strange
sourness
that
may
explain
the
thinness
glad
i
tried
but
will
not
be
on
my
list
of
regulars
a
must
try
mk
drinkability
decent
but
not
very
interesting
the
sour
finish
detracts
from
what
otherwise
is
rather
enjoyable
d
a
unique
stout
a
beer
i
would
definitely
try
again
but
just
a
little
too
much
smoke
and
carbonation
for
my
liking
like
many
other
dfh
brews
this
is
reverent
to
the
style
but
also
unique
and
full
of
character
d
very
tasty
but
the
bitterness
lowers
the
drinkability
fairly
well
carbonated
with
a
medium
to
full
body
and
a
sticky
finish
is
not
unpleasant
but
it
brings
the
drinkability
down
some
overall
not
really
a
very
impressive
beer
the
flavor
that
is
there
is
nice
and
very
well
balanced
but
it
needs
more
all
around
to
become
anything
i
would
seek
out
overall
its
not
bad
more
above
average
than
average
or
below
but
they
could
have
made
improved
it
by
making
it
a
little
less
complex
less
watery
and
a
little
more
focus
on
the
chicorycoffee
taste
reviewing
from
a
bottle
but
also
had
one
on
tap
at
the
brewery
less
than
a
week
ago
pours
a
deep
black
with
some
ruby
highlights
head
is
a
big
dissapointment
nothing
to
speak
of
to
really
be
a
top
shelf
stout
i
think
a
beer
has
to
have
a
big
thick
foamy
head
smell
of
rich
roasted
coffee
taste
follows
suit
with
some
background
notes
of
nuts
nice
mild
bitter
aftertaste
nothing
special
to
note
about
mouthfeel
but
maybe
not
as
creamy
as
i
would
like
i
nice
drinkable
stout
that
i
would
return
to
its
not
storm
king
but
its
worth
a
try
body
is
good
with
a
decent
body
and
somewhat
active
on
tongue
but
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
this
bitter
funk
that
settles
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
that
kind
of
just
ruins
everything
so
ill
bring
this
home
and
sharetrade
it
with
people
who
want
stuff
from
far
off
lands
and
not
have
to
do
this
again
tastes
include
coffee
molasses
and
hints
of
licorice
i
need
to
remember
to
keep
more
of
this
brew
around
drinkability
it
is
definitely
a
beer
to
enjoy
d
differently
one
of
those
brews
that
you
must
take
your
time
on
take
to
big
of
a
sip
of
this
one
and
youll
have
to
pause
for
a
breather
tastes
unique
not
something
that
ill
keep
in
stock
in
the
fridge
but
maybe
something
ill
desire
again
one
day
unique
enough
to
recommend
any
stout
lover
to
try
thin
red
brown
body
with
a
short
lived
carbonated
head
aroma
is
almost
all
coffee
with
just
a
pinch
of
nuttiness
and
smoke
flavor
has
no
distinguishing
chicory
however
tons
of
roasted
coffee
and
some
vanilla
and
banana
notes
are
present
dry
but
unbalanced
too
thin
and
not
very
exciting
this
is
rather
middleoftheroad
in
terms
of
body
though
for
a
midlevel
brew
the
flavors
have
a
nice
length
and
subtlety
to
them
as
well
the
smoothness
makes
for
easy
drinking
too
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dh
brewshighly
recommended
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
on
the
entrance
and
a
thin
almost
watery
finish
interesting
stout
from
dfh

nearblack
with
a
decent
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nose
is
chicoryintensive
with
roasted
malts
and
rising
dough
backing
it
up
flavor
is
pretty
tight
on
the
tongue
and
opens
up
a
bit
upon
swallowing
to
a
coffeeish
taste
with
a
semicreamy
mouthfeel
like
most
dfh
beers
this
one
is
interesting
but
not
necessarily
all
that
drinkable
its
more
intellectual
than
it
is
inviting
im
almost
done
with
this
sixpack
and
when
i
am
i
doubt
ill
be
buying
this
again
but
im
thankful
for
the
learning
experience
not
really
that
appealing
or
drinkable
a
bit
disappointing
from
dfh
overall
a
very
good
stout
recommended
jet
black
in
color
with
a
beige
colored

this
beer

thick
with
hints

coffee

and
a
slight
bourbon
smell
a
definate
taste
of
coffee
very
smooth
and
no

suprisingly
light
for
a
stout
didnt
seem
too
big

im
impressed
with
my

from
the

mouthfeeldrikability
this
is
fairly
well
carbonated
for
a
stout
that
makes
it
very
drinkable
for
me
it
just
feels
lighter
medium
bodied
for
a
stout
and
does
not
hit
the
stomach
too
heavy
i
love
this
beer
it
is
excellent
overall
not
bad
and
i
might
buy
it
again
if
i
saw
it
but
definitely
not
something
youd
want
to
drink
too
frequently
this
beer
is
more
the
color
of
a
porter
it
has
a
tan
colored
head
the
smell
is
herbal
and
slightly
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
roasted
roots
i
can
taste
the
similarity
in
this
to
the
chicory
found
in
salads
it
comes
through
well
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fair
the
roast
flavor
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
i
could
drink
these
again
this
beer
reminds
me
more
of
a
porter

this
was
a
mildly
exciting
beer
it
was
a
black
color
with
a
coffeecolored
head
the
odor
was
all
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
it
tasted
like
black
coffee
with
a
little
chocolate
and
hops
in
the
background
it
was
smooth
and
rich
but
i
think
i
expected
more
from
it
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
opaque
with
deep
red
highlights
and
a
decent
sized
tan
head
that
doesnt
lace
but
leaves
a
little
film
the
whole
way
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
mostly
a
mix
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
primarily
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
along
with
some
faint
hop
bitterness
but
unfortunately
this
is
a
little
weak
on
the
flavor
there
is
a
good
thickness
and
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
good
stout
but
a
little
mild
and
not
very
challenging
on
the
palate
drinkability
very
very
good
well
worth
a
nightcap
drink
best
stout
this
year

unexceptional

just
a

bitterness
from
the
fuggle

mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
very
light
carbonation
slight
dryness
and
a

i
find
it
to
be
very
quaffable
i
also
like
that
they
include
a
bit
of
oats
in
their
grist
list
finish
is
long
and
dry
verdict
its
certainly
one
of
the
more
interesting
stouts
ive
had
the
sharply
herbal
flavor
in
the
finish
isnt
usual
for
the
style
its
a
little
much
but
i
like
that
theyre
thinking
out
of
the
box
with
this
stout
overzealously
carbonated
and
too
thin
for
the
rushing
hopoils
and
rubbery
biting
coffee
roast
tastes
maybe
good
for
iced
coffee
fans
the
first
let
down
ive
ever
had
from
dfh
but
still
much
better
than
most
breweries
which
is
either
a
really
huge
complement
to
dfh
intended
or
a
major
diss
to
most
breweries
also
true
notes
once
again
dfh
makes
a
beer
very
different
from
other
beers
in
the
style
however
i
think
this
one
falls
a
little
short
after
being
very
promising
on
the
eyes
and
the
nose
another
good
effort
from
dfh
i
still
prefer
their
ipas
to
the
specialty
brews
excellent
beer
craftsmanship
as
expected
from
dogfish
head
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
chicory
or
coffee
but
this
beer
is
unexpectedly
yummy
drinkability
not
too
strong
with
a
nice
mellow
aftertaste
i
could
take
at
least
a
couple
of
these
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
creamy
head
the
aroma
was
malty
with
some
light
coffee
scent
the
flavor
was
of
medium
bitterness
smooth
creamy
yeasty
like
fresh
dark
bread
mild
coffee
flavor
and
a
variety
of
spices
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
stout
drinkability
one
is
enough
this
is
not
an
offensive
brew
but
i
like
my
beer
to
tast
like
beer
or
stout
to
taste
like
stout
if
i
want
coffee
i
will
go
to
tim
hortons
12
ounce
bottle
dogfish
head
chicory
stout
pours
out
a
nearly
black
color
with
a
large
tan
head
which
fades
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
after
a
couple
minutes
the
aroma
is
mainly
chocolate
and
coffee
sweet
coffee
flavor
but
missing
the
roastiness
that
i
expected
which
leaves
this
beer
a
little
too
sweet
the
finish
is
brief
and
unmemorable
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
too
low
just
an
ok
stout
but
worth
trying
at
least
once
ive
heard
great
things
about
dogfish
head
but
this
is
a
big
disappointment
this
pours
out
dark
black
with
a
nice
lightly
tanned
head
it
never
pours
tall
or
strong
but
it
lingers
and
keeps
the
small
halo
of
bubbles
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
i
have
come
to
love
it
smells
a
sweet
stout
with
a
strong
bitter
chocolate
like
aroma
it
has
a
different
taste
than
i
expect
not
really
deep
in
complexity
there
is
a
strong
chocolate
aftertaste
the
flavor
at
the
beginning
is
different
i
have
never
had
any
chicory
before
it
isnt
earthy
really
maybe
it
is
a
little
woodsy
tasting
sort
of
a
coffee
bitterness
not
the
most
exciting
stout
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
decent
it
has
a
mouthfeel
that
is
just
a
bit
too
watery
and
light
for
what
i
would
expect
it
is
a
fine
beer
that
i
wouldnt
feel
bad
trying
again
but
it
just
doesnt
have
anything
that
makes
it
special
taste
is
a
little
sour
with
subtle
notes
of
mocha
not
terrible
but
ive
had
better
extensive
carbonation
make
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
a
little
difficult
but
not
unbearable
its
drinkable
this
is
not
a
horrible
beer
but
its
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
though
body
is
barely
medium
not
as
hearty
as
i
recall
it
being
overactive
carbonation
gives
it
a
fluffy
mouthfeel
has
a
bite
with
some
malt
and
hops
evident
but
it
does
battle
with
the
chicorycoffee
flavor
the
coffee
was
very
prominent
and
not
being
a
coffee
drinker
was
an
interesting
experience
for
me
i
liked
it
though
definitely
a
good
stout
i
could
drink
this
beer
again
cheers
dense
black
in
color
this
beer
pours
with
a
nice
tan
head
certainly
darker
than
the
bone
white
listed
on
the
bottle
but
if
thats
the
biggest
problem
here
i
think
well
be
just
fine
the
smell
is
roasty
with
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
extremely
subued
and
something
else
i
cant
identify
perhaps
the
chicory
the
taste
is
also
interesting
and
similar
to
the
smell
coffee
chocolate
roasty
notes
and
perhaps
chicory
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
though
not
chewy
or
syrupy
seems
about
right
to
me
drinkability
id
have
another
and
perhaps
another
this
sixpack
wont
last
for
too
long
though
its
not
the
most
outstanding
stout
out
there
it
is
one
of
the
smoothest
makes
a
great
session
beer
and
while
there
really
isnt
that
much
hop
presence
the
bitterness
of
the
various
burnt
flavors
nicely
balances
out
the
sweet
malt
and
grain
flavors
recommended
overall
this
a
decent
session
stout
i
imagine
that
it
pairs
very
well
with
chocolate
and
coffeeflavored
deserts
worth
checking
out
i
appreciate
the
uniqueness
but
i
dont
know
how
often
id
buy
this
definately
something
to
try
at
least
once
should
go
nice
with
a
heavy
meal
pours
opaque
black
with
mahogany
highlights
a
dense
light
brown
head
will
hold
a
one
finger
head
and
leave
some
sticky
lacing
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
malt
nose
with
bakers
chocolate
hiding
in
the
background
the
taste
is
very
sweet
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
strong
roasted
character
and
an
almost
smoky
flavor
as
it
warms
very
little
hop
influence
but
the
malt
bitterness
will
balance
the
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
bittersweet
coffee
which
will
become
residual
in
the
finish
however
the
full
body
is
made
crisp
by
a
high
carbonation
and
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
crisp
robust
flavor
but
easy
drinkability
drinkability
good
drinkability
with
this
one
its
not
a
big
heavy
stout
with
a
ton
of
cloying
sweetness
its
lightness
and
crispness
make
for
very
easy
drinking
not
bad
at
all
the
only
thing
i
can
see
wrong
is
the
lie
of
the
bone
white
head
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easy
going
laid
back
stout
from
a
brewery
generaly
producing
beers
that
i
would
classify
as
anything
but
easy
going
and
laid
back
goes
down
well
a
solid
stout
but
nothing
special
about
it
and
lacking
a
bit
of
meat
verdict
drinkable
but
not
memorable
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
feel
it
is
very
drinkable
i
certainly
will
work
this
brew
into
my
regular
beer
rotation
taste
bitter
right
off
the
bat
with
a
slight
creaminess
blended
in
chocolate
and
coffee
jump
out
at
me
kinda
like
a
guinness
on
steroids
mouthfeel
is
light
buttery
at
only
5
2
abv
its
not
gonna
reappear
in
my
fridge
anytime
soon
but
worth
a
try
if
you
like
stouts
that
arent
too
heavy
and
go
down
easy
looked
a
bit
like
a
cocacola
but
a
bigbubbled
beige
head
smell
is
mainly
coffee
with
some
toasty
malt
taste
is
a
full
coffee
and
dark
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
was
thin
just
a
little
watery
for
the
style
easy
to
drink
i
think
it
makes
a
nice
simple
digestif
try
it
with
ice
cream
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
dont
think
that
it
is
something
to
be
quickly
drained
but
it
isnt
something
that
needs
to
be
sipped
either
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
definitely
buy
again
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
intial
flavours
are
good
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
astringencies
become
closer
to
unbearable
i
will
finish
drinking
the
bottle
i
am
drinking
but
i
will
not
be
drinking
anymore
of
these
bottle
poured
a
pitchblack
color
stout
with
a
medium
head
with
great
retention
aroma
of
roasted
and
smoke
malt
is
clearly
dominant
with
a
nice
touch
of
coffee
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
smokiness
and
seems
to
leave
little
place
for
the
coffee
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
carbonation
is
low
not
bad
but
definitely
not
for
me
they
body
is
closer
to
moderate
than
full
some
minor
astingency
notes
carbonation
is
light
but
ok
overall
some
noticeable
off
note
but
nothing
overally
offensive
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
chicory
as
well
this
bottle
was
taken
from
dirtylous
stash
while
he
slept
on
my
couch
d
this
is
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
all
night
long
now
that
it
is
fall
pours
a
very
opaque
dark
brown
with
some
red
visible
at
the
edges
big
tan
head
forms
and
goes
lots
of
lace
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
strange
roasted
grain
aroma
maybe
from
chicory
and
a
shot
of
coffee
taste
is
coffeechocolate
up
front
a
sweet
and
sour
middle
roasty
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
and
very
smooth
different
and
not
half
bad
strong
taste
leaning
toward
bitter
i
love
strong
coffee
but
this
ended
with
more
of
a
coughsyrupy
than
good
coffee
aftertaste
look
and
feel
and
smell
are
its
better
characteristics
taste
is
where
its
lacking
not
fully
developed
a
little
on
the
thin
side
not
bad
but
not
balanced
the
dogfish
india
brown
ale
is
a
better
choice
as
it
enters
the
mouth
you
get
the
coffee
feel
but
it
is
thinner
than
expected
the
chicory
notes
are
nice
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
more
developed
finishes
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
a
slight
bitter
sour
mouthfeel
that
resembles
coffee
not
bad
but
lacks
balance
and
that
final
touch
cheers
smells
of
light
roasted
grains
with
a
colalike
blend
of
sweetness
and
raspy
accent
coffee
is
light
as
is
the
rest
of
the
herb
garden
in
this
beer
taste
is
stoutlight
but
commendable
enough
with
lots
of
mediumroast
coffee
and
vegetal
dryness
in
the
finish
body
is
thin
and
without
character
a
definite
mark
down
on
any
type
of
stout
but
it
fits
with
the
easydrinking
stylings
of
the
brew
this
is
definitely
a
unique
brew
an
odd
one
but
unique
none
the
less
my
second
offering
by
dfh
thanks
to
my
sister
for
this
sample
pours
black
but
not
pitch
black
with
a
large
brown
head
i
had
to
carefully
pour
this
as
the
head
kept
getting
larger
and
larger
and
sliding
down
the
outside
of
the
glass
after
ten
minutes
the
head
disipates
down
to
about
a
14
inch
of
dense
foam
oddly
no
lacing
with
such
a
thick
head
i
expected
lace
smells
of
breads
roasted
malts
bitter
chocolate
chicory
and
coffee
something
else
is
in
the
scent
as
well
not
quite
sure
what
but
it
reminds
me
of
barbeque
on
first
taste
my
tongue
recognises
what
my
nose
did
not
charcoal
after
that
oh
so
thats
what
it
was
moment
my
tongue
also
tasted
coffee
bitter
chocolates
chicory
sticks
roasted
malts
and
bread
there
is
a
difference
between
the
taste
of
malt
and
bread
in
this
beer
the
malt
is
more
grainy
while
the
bread
has
a
chewy
feel
to
it
the
aftertase
is
a
bit
oily
buttery
perhaps
i
did
not
taste
any
diacetyl
it
also
seems
sticky
uneccessarily
sticky
still
though
a
good
beer
goes
great
with
a
nice
smoky
cheeseagain
thanks
to
my
sister
this
is
a
very
dry
finishing
and
acidic
stout
but
wonderfully
drinkable
with
a
moderate
body
great
with
greasy
foods
like
roast
chicken
or
turkey
im
trying
to
find
a
time
when
this
beer
would
be
appropriate
hmmm
im
rather
disappointed
that
i
bought
a
sixpack
unless
you
have
preexistent
penchant
for
chicory
id
give
this
one
a
miss
also
has
the
flavour
of
overbrewed
coffee
the
kind
thats
been
sitting
on
the
burner
for
an
hour
or
so
its
got
that
same
bitter
metallic
burned
tang
to
it
along
with
a
sour
black
licorice
flavour
while
i
like
the
look
and
smell
of
this
beer
heavy
dark
fruit
coffee
herbs
alcohol
its
just
too
offbase
for
me
tastewise
yup
just
too
astringent
as
a
previous
reviewer
put
forward
very
dark
brown
faint
reddish
highlights
the
light
brown
foam
reduced
quickly
but
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
coffee
aroma
is
quite
pronounced
earthy
hops
and
a
little
wood
smoke
moderate
bitterness
with
coffee
starting
things
off
sweet
flavour
with
a
bit
of
acidity
sour
fruit
and
licorice
starts
at
the
midpoint
dry
roasted
finish
that
melds
with
the
other
flavours
but
the
astringency
gets
to
be
a
little
too
strong
after
a
while
a
bit
slick
with
a
fairly
light
body
moderate
carbonation
good
drinkability
especially
if
coffee
stouts
are
your
thing
but
the
astringency
was
a
little
too
strong
for
me
by
the
end
a
flawed
stout
at
best
the
sourness
really
detracts
from
the
taste
its
pretty
overwhelming
this
beer
needs
way
more
balance
all
in
all
though
a
reasonably
good
attempt
at
a
coffee
stout
it
just
seems
like
something
could
be
added
i
expected
a
bit
more
from
a
company
like
dfh
but
i
guess
no
ones
perfect
p
certainly
unique
but
still
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
or
depressionera
coffee
great
dark
lookbut
the
head
was
a
little
smaller
than
other
stouts
great
taste
that
changes
as
the
liquid
moves
over
your
tongue
a
smokey
taste
with
a
hint
of
coffee
i
like
this
stoutit
has
the
right
spices
that
make
it
just
a
little
sweet
this
may
be
a
good
stout
for
people
to
try
who
dont
like
dark
beer
this
beer
is
definitely
different
interesting
match
of
flavors
with
the
bitter
dark
coffee
and
sweet
chocolate
my
mouth
doesnt
know
if
its
coming
or
going
which
makes
for
a
new
beer
experience
its
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
but
its
ok
12

thanks
for
the
opportunity
pours
a

light
brown

over
a
very
dark
brown
liquid
smells
chocolate
with
some
roast
and
a
hint
of
smoke
tastes
roasty
coffee
chocolate
smokey
and
chocolate
dry
rioasty
finish
with
some
grassy

mdthick
mouthfeel
and
mdlight
carbonation
not
emmensly
challenging
but
enjoyable
and
flavorful
looked
forward
to
this
for
some
time
got
a
bottle
at
the
frog
inbetween
bands
at
a
record
store
down
the
street
poured
a
dark
deep
brown
not
black
like
id
figured
alright
head
tan
and
tight
smelled
pretty
good
chocolate
coffee
a
bit
weak
though
first
thing
i
noticed
was
that
it
was
a
bit
thin
for
what
id
expected
def
some
typical
stout
characteristics
def
coffee
but
it
seemed
a
little
sour
off
boring
is
the
best
way
to
put
it
i
guess
i
dont
really
have
much
to
say
as
its
a
pretty
uneventful
drink
i
could
have
a
few
but
i
could
also
have
one
ok
at
best
definitely
not
a
bad
stout
but
just
kind
of
bland
nicelooking
but
it
kind
of
borders
on
boring
and
thin
after
that
the
comparisons
to
a
brown
ale
are
not
out
of
line
though
i
would
still
consider
this
a
stout
for
what
its
worth
overall
an
excellent
beer
but
not
enough
kick
for
a
stout
highly
drinkable
although
i
dont
think
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
this
is
more
of
a
dessert
beer
in
line
with
rogue
chocolate
stout
and
the
like
a
decent
beer
although
the
flavors
seem
to
be
not
well
blended
i
think
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
one
again
due
to
the
price
to
taste
ratio
enjoybale
flavors
and
balanced
well
i
was
actually
expected
something
a
litte
more
bitter
but
everything
seemed
to
be
well
in
check
the
way
it
was
this
stout
provides
the
dark
roasted
full
flavor
of
its
imperial
and
double
cousins
yet
with
just
above
5
percent
abv
this
lends
a
tad
to
its
drinkability
as
well
drinkable
as
a
mild
dark
ale
but
thats
about
the
idea
of
a
chicory
stout
sounds
cool
but
the
reality
is
that
this
needs
to
grow
a
pair
in
order
to
take
its
place
as
a
decent
stout
this
stout
pours
as
a
decent
stout
should
with
a
deep
dark
body
and
a
light
tan
thin
head
and
little
carbonation
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
a
nice
combination
of
cocoa
roasted
malt
coffee
and
sugary
molasses
however
i
found
the
flavor
to
be
a
bit
weak
and
the
bitterness
and
dryness
a
bit
too
strong
a
bit
out
of
balance
the
basic
flavor
profile
is
pretty
good
however
but
this
does
hit
its
drinkability
nice
beer
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
from
dogfish
this
isnt
my
favourite
stout
but
its
still
a
very
approachable
and
drinkable
offering
drinkability
i
could
easily
make
a
session
out
of
this
nothing
to
make
you
go
wow
but
a
classic
example
probably
a
good
crossover
beer
for
all
the
guinness
drinkers
out
there
this
is
well
done
but
not
overpowering
at
all
strongly
recommended
absolutely
a
fantastic
stout
in
all
aspects
dogfish
is
now
two
for
two
in
my
book
and
i
will
be
excited
when
the
90
and
120
minute
make
there
way
to
north
carolina
soon
dark
as
chocolate
syrup
with
a
taste
to
match
better
as
it
wamrs
to
almost
room
temperature
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
tried
in
a
long
time
purchased
as
part
of
sampler
case
poured
a
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
tannish
head
smell
is
chocolate
coffee
and
toasted
malts
taste
is
nice
and
toasty
chocolaty
with
some
bitterness
finishes
dry
and
bitter
in
the
moth
a
most
enjoyable
beer
black
body
with
a
coffee
brown
frothy
head
smells
yeasty
bready
this
is
a
light
flavored
stout
refreshing
in
a
way
if
you
want
the
chicory
to
be
detectable
then
you
cant
go
hard
on
the
roasted
toasted
malt
hops
or
high
alcohol
so
all
these
flavors
are
ballanced
vey
well
so
that
rather
than
the
typical
hop
flavor
at
the
end
there
is
a
light
chicory
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
smooth
and
watery
the
most
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
stout
i
have
had
drinkability
is
high
do
to
its
smooth
body
and
great
ballanced
packaged
in
a
lighter
flavored
stout
but
dont
forget
the
sweet
chicory
surprize
on
the
finish
an
easy
drinking
stout
though
not
as
bold
as
expected
from
dogfish
head
smells
of
sweet
cocoa
coffee
roastedness
and
a
touch
of
molassas
dates
and
figs
the
head
and
the
body
are
both
thin
and
a
little
too
relenting
but
the
flavors
are
melded
nicely
sweet
roasted
malts
with
bold
coffee
and
cocoa
flavors
round
out
nicely
hops
and
roasted
grain
combine
for
fair
bitterness
a
creamy
mouthfeel
aided
by
lactic
acids
make
this
beer
slide
right
down
slight
grape
or
plumb
flavors
chase
the
carbonated
finish
aftertaste
is
a
slight
lingering
dryiness
that
retained
slight
bitterness
its
a
pretty
good
beer
that
isnt
over
the
top
well
this
is
one
odd
beverage
i
tried
it
once
before
before
writing
this
review
i
was
going
to
slam
it
bad
because
it
was
just
horrible
same
6pack
but
the
first
time
it
was
way
too
cold
refrigerator
temprature
it
was
akrid
steeley
thin
sharp
and
unpleasent
this
time
since
it
was
warmed
up
to
maybe
5560
degrees
it
really
turned
itself
around
i
now
recommend
giving
this
a
try
but
drink
it
nice
and
warm
uf
this
is
an
interesting
stout
remarkably
drinkable
this
would
be
a
wonderful
beer
of
which
to
have
several
not
particularly
overpowering
it
does
hold
a
tasty
bitterness
which
makes
the
beer
continuously
engaging
this
would
go
very
well
with
some
grilled
food
the
taste
basic
stout
not
too
full
in
body
but
heftier
than
a
typical
ale
or
lager
stout
enough
to
be
stout
baked
characters
faint
cream
tones
nothing
out
of
the
typical
good
nothing
that
propels
this
brew
into
greatness
however
wet
finish
without
notice
of
hop
dry
effect
drinkable
not
awe
inspiring
or
memorable
though
has
a
black
body
a
little
light
shows
through
when
poured
light
tan
head
that
didnt
stick
around
much
tons
of
roasted
barley
aroma
slightly
sweet
coffee
smoky
but
not
burnt
flavor
was
really
smoky
light
citrusy
sweetness
quite
a
dry
finish
and
a
light
to
medium
body
a
good
beer
but
really
tastes
much
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
as
a
porter
i
may
of
rated
it
higher
but
against
its
style
i
had
to
dock
it
some
mouthfeel
is
pleasing
with
good
body
and
a
vibrant
carbonation
that
propels
each
sip
an
enjoyably
different
stout
that
i
wouldnt
mind
enjoying
on
occassion
fairly
easy
drinking
id
say
this
one
is
worth
your
time
pours
a
very
deep
black
with
just
a
faint
red
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
and
a
finger
of
beige
head
that
quickly
reduces
to
a
cap
that
stays
around
for
the
rest
of
the
beer
very
nice
chocolatey
capuccino
aroma
taste
is
roasty
and
coffeish
upfront
with
some
molasses
and
chocolate
notes
a
faint
hop
note
blending
in
with
the
roasted
bitterness
and
an
astringent
finish
which
becomes
a
little
unpleasant
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
medium
bodied
maybe
a
little
on
the
thin
side
an
ok
stout
nothing
really
exceptional
i
like
this
beer
and
wish
i
could
get
it
more
often
this
is
a
black
beer
that
poured
a
3
finger
head
that
dissapated
quickly
nose
is
a
hint
of
coffee
and
malts
taste
has
a
presence
of
chocolate
at
the
beginning
with
a
nice
coffee
hop
finishnice
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
overall
drinkability
is
very
good
i
would
recommend
this
notes
its
a
stout
body
is
thin
and
the
acrid
and
dryness
is
too
strong
overall
this
wasnt
as
good
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
from
this
12oz
bottles
pours
a
dark
stout
very
nearly
opaque
black
with
a
sticky
light
brown
head
smell
is
a
little
weaker
than
im
used
to
with
dfh
beers
but
some
coffee
and
sweet
chocolate
come
through
the
malt
coffee
and
semisweet
chocolate
flavors
are
big
as
well
as
roasted
grain
some
smoky
woodiness
is
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
would
have
expected
flavor
is
full
and
big
but
somewhat
unbalanced
the
flavors
simply
do
not
flow
well
they
seem
to
go
back
and
forth
a
bit
a
decent
beer
not
bad
by
coffee
stout
standards
but
still
uninspiring
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
the
head
doesnt
stick
around
very
long
it
disappears
leaving
a
small
ring
with
minimal
lacing
the
smell
is
of
coffee
and
chocolate
quite
good
the
taste
is
great
there
a
flavors
of
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
a
bitterness
from
the
hop
addition
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
brings
out
a
lot
of
the
chocolatecoffee
flavors
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
im
so
glad
that
stores
around
my
neighborhood
are
carrying
dogfish
head
brews
now
because
i
couldnt
get
them
for
a
long
time
ive
found
all
of
them
to
be
very
good
so
far
except
for
the
pale
ale
i
would
definately
recommend
the
chicory
stout
thanks
to
acoatley
for
sharing
this
superb
beer
notes
ahted
this
the
first
time
i
tryed
it
needed
a
6th
to
finish
off
the
mix
pack
and
went
iwth
it
cuase
i
ahdnt
ahd
it
in
awhile
much
better
then
i
remember
i
had
heard
it
was
gettign
retired
and
was
happy
hoping
a
better
stout
or
porter
would
take
its
palce
now
i
think
i
wouldnt
mind
t
sticking
around
thanks
to
acoatley
for
sharing
the
bottle
tap
pours
jet
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
aromas
of
roasted
malt
light
coffee
hops
and
leather
altogether
a
fairly
complex
bouquet
of
aromas
that
is
quite
inviting
mild
somewhat
watery
flavor
of
leather
sweat
and
hops
with
oat
and
hop
undertones
light
and
watery
palate
yet
medium
to
full
bodied
drinkability
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
kinda
like
drinking
a
carbonated
iced
coffee
thanks
for
the
sample
guys
finishes
dry
but
drinkable
nonetheless
gets
more
complex
as
it
warms
drinkablity
is
good
for
me
on
this
one
i
am
going
to
enjoy
many
of
these
overall
a
dissapointing
offering
from
dfh
nothing
about
this
beer
seemed
to
mesh
there
really
isnt
a
feature
to
this
stout
that
stood
out
i
guess
it
would
be
a
good
for
beginners
who
are
curious
to
the
style
as
for
me
i
wont
be
looking
this
one
up
any
time
soon
i
do
hope
this
was
an
off
batch
this
is
actually
a
really
good
interpretation
of
a
stout
it
is
on
the
light
side
which
is
perfectly
fine
but
the
extra
unusual
ingredients
really
play
a
profound
role
that
picks
up
the
complexity
of
this
beer
without
really
being
noticeable
in
and
of
themselves
pours
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
2
finger
tan
colored
head
and
is
a
somewhat
opaque
black
color
the
smell
ifs
of
chicory
and
roasted
barley
mostly
this
is
a
fairly
simple
stout
you
get
flavors
of
coffee
some
smoked
chicory
but
not
as
much
as
i
was
expecting
due
to
the
namesake
finishes
up
with
a
bitter
but
sweet
and
matly
aftertaste
descent
but
nothing
extraordinary
more
of
a
fallback
beer
really
a
two
finger
dark
tan
foamy
head
resulted
from
a
pouring
of
a
12
oz
bottle
of
this
very
dark
brown
or
black
beer
a
foam
film
fremained
on
top
while
sampling
this
beer
at
first
i
struggled
with
definite
aromas
coming
from
this
beer
but
soon
discovered
the
main
one
coffee
with
notes
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
followed
through
in
the
taste
makeup
as
well
as
burnt
malt
there
was
also
a
bitter
chicory
edge
to
this
beer
this
was
a
smooth
beer
but
i
felt
it
lacked
depth
and
was
light
in
the
mouth
with
too
much
carbonation
as
well
otherwise
a
pretty
good
beer
i
bought
six
drank
two
and
i
think
ill
cellar
the
rest
ill
bet
that
sourness
will
relax
a
bit
get
back
you
really
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
this
unique
stout
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
stout
all
kinds
but
this
one
caught
me
off
guard
and
when
i
get
to
try
a
new
stout
i
want
to
like
it
chewy
bitter
and
high
alcohol
all
gave
this
one
a
real
off
taste
and
bad
aftertaste
ive
had
coffee
stouts
before
and
really
liked
them
as
im
a
coffee
nut
as
well
but
maybe
it
was
the
chicory
as
well
yuck
ill
pass
on
this
one
in
in
the
future
drinkability
is
decent
i
could
have
another
bottle
good
lord
an
easy
pour
produced
a
massive
foamy
head
on
top
of
coal
black
frosty
very
nice
malt
hop
and
lite
coffee
flavor
what
the
hell
is
chicory
good
carbonation
made
for
a
nice
tangy
finish
after
the
smooth
mellow
start
only
had
one
wish
i
had
more
of
them
as
it
was
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
taste
of
coffee
chicory
chocolate
and
some
citrus
poured
dark
but
it
did
not
pour
a
very
good
head
the
head
was
gone
within
a
few
minutes
very
drinkable
however
the
bottle
did
not
have
to
live
a
long
life
in
its
glass
not
one
of
the
greatest
beers
ive
had
before
but
it
was
definitely
good
a
tad
thin
i
would
say
for
a
stout
a
nice
session
stout
that
incorporates
chicory
nothing
to
get
overly
excited
about
but
certainly
worth
trying
drinkability
and
overall
based
on
reviews
ive
read
i
was
afriad
this
would
not
be
my
beer
but
i
really
like
it
strong
robust
and
full
of
enough
flavor
and
complexity
to
keep
me
drinking
this
is
not
a
beer
for
everyone
dont
let
the
chicory
in
the
name
scare
you
i
can
barely
even
taste
it
dogfish
head
continues
to
push
the
limit
with
their
beers
and
this
one
kick
ass
not
for
everybody
i
found
it
unique
and
full
of
flavour
smooth
though
medium
bodied
stout
aroma
but
unique
with
the
ingredients
somewhere
between
a
coffee
and
a
tea
moderate
roast
licorice
chocolate
malts
and
aggressive
carbonated
finish
you
have
to
like
stouts
had
again
late
in
year
and
sourness
really
came
through
which
didnt
work
this
time
around
the
guy
at
the
store
told
me
someone
returned
this
sixpack
because
it
was
bad
so
he
gave
me
a
bottle
to
see
if
i
thought
so
too
bottled
may04
pours
black
with
red
peeking
through
and
a
1
finger
tan
head
there
is
rust
on
the
bottle
where
the
crimped
part
of
the
cap
was
touching
the
glass
some
coffee
and
chocolate
aromas
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
almost
no
taste
carbonation
and
hops
with
malt
coming
through
as
it
warms
feels
average
tastes
like
a
macro
version
of
a
stout
and
this
is
dogfish
head
were
talkin
about
here
definitely
a
bad
bottle
ive
had
this
before
and
remember
it
tasting
much
better
ill
have
to
rereview
sometime
reflection
i
usually
expect
more
from
dogfish
head
but
this
beer
is
pretty
average
poured
black
with
a
off
white
head
aroma
bitter
sweet
choc
black
licoricemalts
caramel
molasses
light
smoke
coffee
hops
flavor
black
licoricebitter
sweet
chocolate
caramel
molasses
coffeehops
with
malts
and
cherries
thrown
in
could
drink
a
few
of
these
another
good
one
one
from
dfh
pours
a
dark
brown
that
borders
on
black
the
head
while
initially
thick
and
lightbrown
with
rocklike
crags
and
large
bubbles
soon
declines
into
nothingness
for
most
of
the
experience
there
is
no
sign
of
a
head
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
barley
baking
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
little
chicory
actually
to
a
small
degree
it
resembles
a
chicory
flavored
coffee
the
taste
is
dry
and
bitter
grainy
and
a
little
slickoiliness
roasted
almost
charred
flavor
pushes
into
the
hindtaste
with
a
generous
hop
bitterness
its
good
but
overall
its
something
of
a
middleofthe
road
stout
not
impressed
with
this
stout
label
boasts
of
coffee
flavor
and
its
there
but
nothing
different
from
just
about
any
other
stout
ive
had
appearance
was
disappointing
with
little
to
no
head
ok
color
not
jet
black
but
very
dark
brown
smell
actually
pretty
good
but
again
nothing
unique
here
taste
eh
again
not
bad
just
not
exceptionally
good
mouthfeel
quite
thin
and
watery
for
a
stout
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
guinness
is
better
and
cheaper
so
thats
probably
what
ill
be
purchasing
in
the
future
im
not
sure
what
happened
here
but
this
is
not
good
beer
by
any
measure
dhcb
is
hitormiss
with
me
and
chicory
stout
is
an
unqualified
miss
maybe
the
brewers
simply
need
to
add
triple
the
amount
of
st
johns
wort
so
that
disappointment
isnt
so
acute
in
those
who
buy
and
drink
this
beer
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
and
chewy
but
as
for
drinkability
i
dont
think
the
flavor
was
pronounced
enough
for
me
to
want
to
down
a
second
one
in
one
sitting
just
not
enough
overall
flavor
notes
an
interesting
thing
to
try
this
is
not
my
favorite
stout
and
i
did
not
even
find
it
altogether
appealing
the
creativity
and
craft
is
what
i
love
about
dogfish
not
their
perfection
very
interesting
beers
come
from
dogfish
this
is
one
of
them
i
praise
them
for
that
drinkability
its
an
ok
coffee
stout
nothing
spectacular
and
the
mouthfeel
is
really
bizarre
and
not
at
all
what
youd
expect
for
the
style
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
this
is
an
ok
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
carbination
this
would
be
even
better
but
the
drinkabilty
is
affected
by
the
carbination
your
average
stout
until
the
finish
which
has
some
nice
coffee
notes
and
latent
choclate
sweetness
on
tap
this
is
marvelous
in
bottles
it
is
very
solid
if
you
can
get
it
it
trumps
guiness
and
mackeson
as
a
very
go
to
stout
when
out
at
the
bars
in
nj
not
very
heavy
in
the
stomach
reminds
me
of
most
brew
pub
stouts
except
slightly
heavier
but
not
as
much
so
as
super
stouts
the
chicory
is
apparent
on
the
extreme
end
of
aftertaste
a
nice
addition
a
well
balanced
beer
worth
trying
an
average
stout
the
head
is
a
cramy
somewhat
dark
beige
head
that
dissapears
quickly
certainly
not
the
bone
white
head
that
the
label
describes
the
appearance
is
almost
black
with
some
dark
red
hues
the
beer
is
practically
opaque
it
smells
like
strong
coffee
with
some
hops
smoke
and
chicory
present
the
taste
is
a
littel
tart
cafe
du
monde
in
new
orleans
make
a
coffee
with
chicory
that
tastes
a
lot
like
this
the
mouthful
isnt
as
full
as
most
stouts
but
the
aftertaste
is
pretty
strong
coffee
smokey
chicory
some
odd
bitterness
and
a
bite
of
anise
linger
for
a
good
long
while
the
fact
that
this
is
not
as
thick
as
most
stouts
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
an
interesting
offering
from
dfh
that
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
too
boring
re
flavor
for
me
to
go
back
to
a
slightly
above
average
stout
pleasant
yet
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
aroma
is
nutty
with
coffee
smells
in
the
background
the
taste
is
very
good
carbonated
slightly
with
a
nutty
taste
that
is
coffee
like
and
pleasantly
bitter
the
aftertaste
is
much
like
the
bottom
of
a
cup
of
coffee
very
good
stout
this
beer
pours
a
very
deep
brown
not
as
black
as
i
would
want
for
a
stout
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
the
flavor
is
a
bit
thin
there
is
a
nice
mocha
infusion
in
there
with
coffee
overtones
but
it
is
still
a
bit
thin
the
mouthfeel
is
better
than
the
flavor
its
nice
and
thick
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
another
good
beer
from
the
dogfish
head
company
have
one
for
dessert
mouthfeel
is
medium
there
is
some
minor
character
in
the
form
of
carbonation
but
its
not
viscuous
and
just
a
shade
above
average
drinkability
is
similar
decent
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
if
i
ever
get
a
male
black
lab
ill
name
him
stout
and
think
of
this
version
pours
out
very
dark
brown
as
put
by
the
extremely
cute
bartender
thats
one
of
the
darkest
beers
ive
ever
seen
and
she
couldnt
have
been
any
more
right
aroma
consists
of
burnt
and
smoked
malts
the
hops
were
almost
not
present
at
all
this
is
a
very
malty
beer
the
taste
was
just
overwhelming
it
is
not
a
terrible
taste
but
it
is
extremely
smoky
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
is
my
uncle
makes
these
smoked
baby
back
ribs
and
theyre
really
good
but
you
can
only
eat
a
few
before
the
smoky
taste
gets
to
you
i
will
not
be
having
this
beer
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
it
was
a
struggle
getting
thru
one
of
these
dogfish
in
michigan
a
good
thing
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
in
color
into
the
glass
a
chocolate
brown
head
develops
aroma
is
of
coffee
cocoa
and
rhubarb
the
first
sip
reveals
a
very
sweet
taste
that
seems
like
there
is
a
milk
added
another
sip
reveals
a
roasted
coffee
taste
it
sometimes
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
ok
im
glad
someone
tried
it
a
decent
but
not
outstanding
stout
poured
a
nice
tan
head
which
made
me
laugh
as
it
says
right
on
the
bottle
beneath
a
bone
white
head
anyway
for
a
stout
a
tan
head
is
acceptable
though
i
thought
the
brown
hints
of
this
brew
made
it
a
little
unappealing
visually
even
though
it
was
very
black
and
completely
opaque
the
aroma
reminded
me
of
dirty
wood
with
a
slight
roasted
grain
finish
not
very
pleasant
but
not
indicative
of
any
fault
in
the
beer
so
i
gave
it
a
2
5
the
taste
was
very
smooth
and
there
was
a
very
nice
finish
to
this
beer
that
woodyness
is
present
in
the
beginning
but
only
as
a
background
to
the
upcoming
blend
of
light
sweet
malt
and
a
very
smooth
clean
roasted
malt
flavor
this
beer
has
a
lighter
body
than
i
like
in
a
stout
and
the
carbonation
detracts
from
the
flavors
making
the
carbonic
bite
take
away
a
lot
of
the
in
the
initial
rush
of
flavor
this
beer
is
one
that
is
worth
trying
but
not
one
worth
mentioning
to
anyone
unless
you
are
trying
to
dissuade
him
or
her
from
brewing
with
chicory
the
chicory
taste
is
like
a
woody
dirty
coffee
flavor
that
is
only
semipleasant
as
i
appreciate
the
attempt
that
the
brewer
made
and
i
also
appreciate
the
diversity
on
the
shelves
this
ale
presents
absolutely
nothing
offensive
but
without
the
power
of
the
best
beers
from
dogfish
head
it
seems
to
drift
toward
blandness
drinkability
meh
this
beer
poured
black
with
a
tan
head
when
the
glass
is
held
against
light
a
slight
dark
cherry
color
could
be
detected
where
the
light
was
able
to
show
through
a
little
the
smell
was
of
dark
cocoa
and
espresso
the
taste
was
good
mostly
a
cocoa
coffee
flavor
seemed
slighly
sweet
until
the
hops
kicked
in
rounding
the
flavor
out
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
very
easy
drinking
stoudt
beer
p
s
i
got
a
sixer
of
this
with
a
friend
who
doesnt
drink
much
beer
and
he
loved
it
so
if
this
can
help
introduce
newbies
into
the
world
of
craft
beer
then
it
cant
be
all
that
bad
tastes
like
it
smells
almost
like
a
jelly
belly
jelly
bean
toasted
marshmellow
mixed
with
a
cappucino
i
cant
taste
the
roasted
chocory
that
the
bottle
promises
but
the
organic
mexican
coffee
is
apparent
an
excellent
stout
though
a
little
overpriced
super
smooth
and
creamy
with
excellent
carbonation
an
easy
drinking
stout
with
great
taste
dry
sweet
and
everything
in
between
nice
rich
cocoa
vanilla
aroma
deep
black
colored
beer
with
a
cherry
hue
light
brown
colored
head
poured
thick
but
faded
rather
quickly
to
a
film
leaving
no
sign
of
lace
bitter
cocoa
flavor
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
a
little
nuttywoody
body
is
solid
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
final
thought
about
what
i
expected
a
very
good
lighter
stout
that
will
periodically
be
in
my
rotation
of
singles
pickups
very
refreshing
this
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
that
is
lets
almost
no
light
through
and
has
a
collar
of
bubbles
as
a
head
substitute
smells
of
roasted
coffee
with
malt
sweetness
stick
out
and
a
slight
hop
scent
as
well
there
are
notes
of
chocolate
as
well
stirring
about
the
taste
is
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
slight
bitterness
to
it
a
bit
of
smokiness
and
spice
possibly
the
chicory
can
be
detected
as
well
mouthfeel
is
good
on
this
one
as
it
is
creamy
and
silky
and
it
goes
down
east
as
well
a
good
stout
from
dfh
with
a
slightly
different
flavor
than
most
wyll
film
of
bubbles
passes
as
head
on
this
dark
brownblack
brew
aroma
is
of
dark
malts
mainly
with
a
tidbit
of
hops
making
an
appearance
taste
follows
along
the
same
lines
with
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
dominant
a
bit
of
bitterness
due
to
the
heavy
dark
malt
bill
in
the
recipe
but
thats
about
all
i
can
complain
about
in
the
mouthfeel
same
trait
of
the
brew
affects
the
drinkability
but
overall
an
enjoyable
quaff
beer
is
good
happy

more
quality
brew
from
dfh
a
solid

overall
with
a
nice
roasted

finish
to
it
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
bit
of
smokiness
added
in
what
was
interesting
about
this
beer
is
that
i
bought
a
6er
and
drank
five
of
them
within
about
2
weeks
and
i
was
not
overly
impressed
the
flavors
seemed
muted
and
the
ending
was
a
little
bitter
i
just
now
drank
the
6th
about
3
months
after
the
originals
and
it
seems
like
a
different
beer
the
flavors
are
bolder
maltier
and
sweeter
perhaps
let
a
few
mellow
and
see
if
you
have
the
same
results
still
not
in
my
top
5
stouts
but
quite
good
not
as
robust
as
i
like
in
a
stout
but
what
was
truly
intriguing
was
the
waft
of
roast
chocolate
almost
smokey
like
perhaps
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
palate
but
certainly
worth
the
nostril
adventure
sat
really
boldly
for
a
short
time
but
the
head
quickly
dissipated
overall
an
enjoyable
experience
overall
a
good
beer
i
would
drink
this
one
as
a
single
bottle
now
and
again
but
i
seriously
doubt
that
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
this
is
a
bizarre
stout
its
not
very
good
but
not
entirely
bad
either
the
sourness
and
metals
are
odd
but
unique
the
thin
body
and
diacetyl
are
offputting
despite
these
wierd
shortcomings
it
tends
to
grow
on
me
closer
to
a
porter
than
a
stout
not
bad
but
the
coffee
causes
it
to
be
a
little
too
acidic
for
my
taste
drinkability
fair
for
a
coffee
stout
i
wouldnt
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
to
obtain
it
but
i
also
wouldnt
hide
to
avoid
it
either
an
ok
beer
but
not
what
i
usually
expect
from
a
stout
i
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
anymore
of
this
anytime
soon
overall
a
slightly
above
average
stout
but
the
dfh
worldwide
stout
is
far
better
in
all
respects
it
would
also
go
well
as
a
precursor
to
a
more
fuller
bodied
stout
just
to
get
the
taste
buds
flowing
taste
is
bitter
and
smoky
dry
coffee
flavors
evident
and
a
nice
bittersweet
aftertaste
a
bit
thin
fo
rmy
tastes
but
still
a
tasty
stout
a
bit
more
body
and
it
would
be
great
easy
to
drink
ok
but
nothing
outstanding
12oz
bottle
packaged
in
dec
03
poured
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
tinge
of
ruby
red
at
the
edges
and
a
thick
fluffy
head
that
settled
down
to
a
dense
layer
of
froth
coffee
and
sugar
dominate
the
aroma
with
roasted
malt
and
a
faint
presence
of
hops
body
seemed
a
bit
thin
on
first
sip
but
turns
out
to
be
quite
rounded
and
satisfying
very
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
stout
i
can
enjoy
slightly
dry
and
full
of
flavor
that
is
a
good
roasted
malt
and
coffee
treat
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
damn
fine
stout
ng
chicory
stout
but
i
dont
taste
any
chicory
a
little
misleading
thats
all
poured
out
a
lighter
shade
of
black
with
very
little
head
but
some
lacing
was
around
the
glass
smell
was
mostly
coffee
with
some
underlying
of
espresso
taste
was
ok
i
guess
it
tries
to
combine
the
coffee
chocolate
espresso
hops
and
malts
all
together
and
it
goes
all
over
the
place
not
to
mention
the
roasted
aftertaste
that
seems
like
its
going
to
stay
with
you
for
a
while
only
to
go
away
very
quickly
it
was
quite
smooth
and
creamy
ill
give
it
that
but
as
a
stout
goes
its
only
ok
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
very
small
dark
tan
head
the
lack
of
carbonation
surprised
and
upset
me
but
i
move
on
the
smell
was
between
coffee
and
espresso
with
slight
chocolate
tones
to
it
not
bad
the
taste
was
a
bit
off
in
my
mind
though
roasted
coffee
is
upfront
but
the
roasted
mouthfeel
leaves
abruptly
much
more
chocolate
than
i
would
expect
hops
provide
a
nice
counter
balance
of
bitterness
to
the
sweet
flavor
but
no
real
flavor
in
themselves
a
creamy
coffee
taste
comes
back
in
the
finish
along
with
some
bittersweet
chocolate
my
problem
with
this
beer
was
the
fact
that
all
of
the
flavor
that
i
mentioned
had
an
astringency
to
them
this
was
esp
true
relating
to
the
coffee
it
almost
seemed
like
the
batch
might
have
been
infected
with
something
i
dont
know
this
couldve
been
really
good
but
something
went
wrong
and
threw
a
nasty
astrigent
flavor
in
with
all
the
other
flavors
i
have
a
few
more
in
my
fridge
maybe
i
will
see
if
they
were
all
like
this
for
me
this
brew
has
a
very
nice
overall
flavor
to
it
definite
flavors
of
coffee
and
malt
up
front
that
goes
together
nicely
also
can
pick
out
the
slight
chocolate
flavors
within
this
brew
thought
i
would
experience
move
of
a
chicory
coffee
taste
to
it
almost
like
having
a
nice
cup
of
coffee
while
sitting
outside
café
du
monde
in
orleans
but
it
was
not
i
feel
that
the
brew
could
be
a
little
heavier
based
on
the
style
but
over
all
i
think
it
was
a
good
beer
based
on
it
being
a
thinner
with
a
nice
flavor
i
think
this
could
be
a
pretty
nice
session
brew
light
to
medium
body
smooth
doesnt
feel
like
a
stout
at
all
more
like
a
cola
a
bit
of
a
biting
astringency
to
it
good
beer
not
a
good
stout
dogfish
head
chicory
stout
was
an
opaque
brown
with
a
good
coffee
colored
head
the
lace
was
also
good
the
aroma
was
both
coffeeish
and
metallic
the
taste
had
elements
of
chocolate
and
coffee
mexican
coffee
according
to
the
label
some
sweetness
and
a
decent
hop
bite
this
was
a
smooth
beer
not
as
chewy
as
i
anticipated
and
with
little
of
the
toasted
taste
i
was
expecting
it
wasnt
as
heavy
as
many
other
stouts
the
finish
was
dry
and
a
little
bittersweet
no
doubt
a
decent
dessert
beer
the
dated
bottle
was
a
good
feature
i
still
think
this
is
a
nice
brew
but
i
guess
i
expected
more
from
dfh
on
this
one
poured
into
the

very

to

its

different
perhaps
a
little
to
bitter
for
me
has
a
nice
dark
cola
color
and
a
good
head
the
aroma
was
malty
with
a
slight
chocolate
note
as
for
its
mouthfeel
it
was
far
thinner
than
id
expected
which
might
make
it
more
suitable
for
session
drinking
than
an
average
stout
very
malty
almost
smoky
taste
with
slight
black
coffee
undertones
quite
a
delight
to
drink
a
big
thanks
to
noclueaboutbeer
for

this
one
out

the

from

the

as
it

in

a

the

the
crisp

i
find
so
appealing
in

light

as
the
beer
warms
to
the

and
the
home

the

is
middling
in
feel
with
the
finish
acidulous
hops
are
benign
and
pleasant
to
the
palate
aftertaste
desert
dry
and
a
lingering
semisweetness
remains
long
after
the
swallow
is
gone
a
good
drinking
beer
finish
seems
empty
as
if
the
brewers
forgot
a
key
ingredient
the
rest
of
this
sixer
will
be
headed
for
a
frankenstein
laboratory
of
blackandtans
with
some
various
hoppy
ales
in
an
attempt
to
balance
the
onedimensional
oxidized
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
light
brown
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
the
scent
of
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
malts
the
taste
is
of
rich
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
it
has
a
bit
of
woody
flavor
to
it
which
only
enhances
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
stout
its
full
of
flavor
and
is
still
highly
drinkable
to
the
ocassional
stout
drinker
a
dark
black
beer
with
a
dark
head
poured
into
my
glass
the
aroma
was
of
coffee
and
hints
of
chicory
nothing
overpowering
but
a
noticeable
the
flavor
is
a
match
for
the
aroma
big
hints
of
coffee
malt
and
that
hint
of
chicory
twisted
together
to
form
an
interesting
brew
well
i
think
it
is
the
chicory
chicory
is
a
substitute
for
coffee
and
there
is
a
twist
in
the
coffee
flavor
of
this
stout
a
light
feeling
in
the
mouth
and
a
good
level
of
enjoyment
and
drink
ability
overall
and
nice
brew

i
dont
know
what
to
say
about
this
one
i
was
hoping
or
maybe
wishing
for
a
little
more
overall
but
still
an
enjoyable
brew
just
the
same
dark
brown
pour
and
decent
one
finger
tan
head
that
soon
disappeared
great
smell
of
roasted

hops
chocolate
all
things
dark
taste
was
slightly
bitter
slightly
acidic
mostly
roasted
and
definite
hints
of
chocolate
and

not
bad
but
nothing
really
to
make
me
shout
wow
decent
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
carbonation
level
a
nice
offering
but
there
are
much
better
stouts
out
there
to
be
sure
taste
fizzy
at
first
and
watery
thereafter
slight
metallic
sourness
reminiscent
of
cold
coffee
definite
earthiness
and
coffee
notes
in

more
slight
acid
at

end
with
a
slight
drawing
of

pretty
disappointed
here
drinkability
okay
but
many
better
to
try
and
retry
drinkability
its
not
bad
and
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
it
easily
but
i
wouldnt
trade
for
it
or
anything
i
was
underwhelmed
by
this
one
but
then
again
i
did
just
recently
have

i
suspect
the
coffee
used
in
this
was
not
as
darkly
roasted

the

used
in

drinkability
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
another
great
dfh
beer
zum
wohl
a
much
more
subtle
stout
than
i
expected
pours
a
deep
near
black
colour
with
a
grand
off
white
head
which
takes
decent
time
to
dissolve
leaving
a
mild
stickiness
on
the
glass
smells
weer
quite
mellow
with
a
bit
of
roastiness
accompanying
bread
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
aggresisve
than
the
smell
but
nicely
balanced
between
the
coffee
and
chocolate
theres
a
sweet
kick
at
the
finish
as
well
this
is
quite
a
dry
brew
that
was
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
for
a
supposedly
premium
product
i
was
extremely
dissappointed
with
this
offering
the
appearance
was
slightly
above
average
head
was
just
ok
and
appearance
was
a
bit
lighter
than
i
like
taste
was
a
bit
like
lemonade
puckery
with
just
a
hint
of
smoke
mouthfeel
was
more
like
a
mikes
hard
lemonade
than
a
stout
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
medium
size
light
tan
head
not
white
like
the
label
states
that
mostly
diminishes
leaving
good
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
of
roasted
coffee
some
bitter
chocolate
maybe
some
chicory
in
there
as
well
as
well
as
a
bit
of
hoppiness
a
fairly
subtle
nose
overall
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
somewhat
bitter
some
smokiness
poking
through
and
a
mild
hoppiness
sneaking
in
also
medium
in
body
mild
in
the
carbonation
false
advertising
dammit
the
bottle
says
bone
white
head
the
head
was
none
to
white
or
creamcolored
though
i
suppose
it
was
certainly
lighter
than
the
heads
on
most
stouts
coffee
beans
have
a
next
grovery
aisle
over
subtleness
to
them
not
very
pronounced
light
but
creamy
mouthfeel
is
not
entirely
impressive
rather
the
brew
is
a
bit
thin
with
a
mediumish
body
that
could
stand
a
little
more
meat
very
drinkable
however
easy
sippin
the
flavor
is
pretty
straightforward
some
coffeeish
hints
initial
finish
lends
the
feel
of
chewing
on
wood
chips
brief
spike
of
intense
roasted
bitter
aftertaste
fades
pretty
quickly
the
feel
is
ok
but
a
bit
watery
not
bad
mind
you
just
a
bit
watery
very
nice
drinkability
as
i
could
enjoy
this
for
hours
of
slow
sipping
overall
its
just
a
really
nice
and
unique
stout
im
not
really
crazy
about
it
but
it
captures
the
essence
of
chicory
and
roasted
barley
perfectly
so
for
what
it
is
a
all
that
wonderful
flavor
crammed
into
a
5
2abv
package
quite
an
accomplishment
getting
that
done
without
the
beer
coming
across
as
thin
or
onedimensional
stouts
are
certainly
on
my
short
list
of
favorite
styles
but
not
usually
a
highly
drinkable
session
thing
this
one
leans
that
way
too
but
has
enough
character
without
too
much
alcohol
to
earn
a
good
rating
a
dark
and
nearly
opaque
body
that
held
up
to
the
light
a
little
is
dark
red
clear
not
cloudy
and
bubblysustaining
the
head
nicely
the
head
is
not
exactly
bone
white
as
advertised
but
is
more
the
color
of
my
lung
tissue
tan
and
amber
hints
creamy
looking
the
head
stays
and
leaves
what
ill
call
2535
lace
in
the
glass
im
not
sure
if
i
should
leave
or
take
points
for
not
being
bone
white
dont
think
i
will
just
be
advised
sweet
scents
hit
the
air
upon
opening
and
seems
like
milk
chocolate
malted
milk
balls
dark
coffee
and
some
caramel
but
the
flavors
contain
a
whoa
amount
of
coffee
making
me
wonder
if
im
going
to
get
a
caffiene
buzz
from
this
one
if
they
could
brew
this
with
tobacco
and
eggs
in
it
id
drink
it
for
breakfast
yuk
yuk
yuk
it
starts
like
a
cafe
a
lait
and
dries
in
the
finishes
up
with
a
roasty
hopped
espresso
delight
a
little
cocoa
middle
and
molasses
post
flavor
hinting
about
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
that
has
a
creaminess
in
the
start
but
crispens
up
crispening
all
in
all
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
the
beer
could
use
a
little
more
balance
ti
seems
to
leave
too
much
on
the
palate
for
my
liking
notes
good
beer
very
well
named
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
for
people
who
want
strong
flavor
in
their
brews
eclipse
black
color
small
head
aroma
is
coffee
a
medium
bodied
stout
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
boy
oh
boy
is
there
coffee
in
this
one
chicory
and
mexican
coffee
blend
with
the
malts
for
a
very
interesting
intense
coffee
flavor
hops
are
slightly
bitter
and
a
touch
on
the
grapefruity
side
well
balanced
the
coffee
flavor
predominates
but
is
not
very
overpowering
a
nice
beer
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
im
a
big
fan
of
chicory
coffee
so
i
have
a
feeling
i
am
gonna
like
this
one
plus
it
is
my
first
taste
of
dogfish
head
poured
a
jet
black
didnt
look
like
a
too
too
heavy
of
a
body
topped
of
with
a
head
that
reminded
me
most
like
when
warm
soda
is
poured
into
a
glass
very
bubbly
and
brown
but
low
retention
the
aroma
is
a
nice
chicory
burnt
coffee
aroma
plenty
of
malty
goodness
the
taste
is
really
good
and
the
flavors
coat
your
mouth
well
the
taste
was
a
full
of
chocolate
and
sharp
smelling
coffee
with
a
hint
of
earthy
smoke
very
well
done
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
more
from
this
brewery
drinkability
is
averageit
tasted
good
just
not
the
way
i
thought
it
should
but
for
the
price
i
paid
i
will
not
pick
up
any
of
these
unless
they
go
on
sale
decent
but
flavor
isnt
complex
or
balanced
seems
a
little
off
in
some
aspects
could
be
a
little
richer
but
still
just
slightly
above
average
pitch
black
hue
some
carbonation
and
no
head
contrary
to
the
label
talk
no
bone
white
head
deep
coffee
beans
chocolate
and
licorise
on
the
nose
very
pleasant
surprisingly
thin
up
front
coffee
flavors
subdued
oily
slick
charcoal
to
be
noted
in
the
body
borderline
medium
bodied
confusing
seems
a
bit
out
of
balance
was
expecting
more
rich
and
deep
flavors
ok
my
bottle
said
that
the
beer
would
have
a
bonewhite
head
either
theyre
stupid
or
it
was
a
joke
because
this
head
is
a
nicely
foamy
medium
tan
the
body
is
a
nicely
opaque
black
the
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
coffee
black
chocolate
licorice
charcoal
and
something
that
may
or
may
not
be
chicory
not
really
strong
nose
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
reserved
and
balance
im
used
to
dogfish
head
stuff
being
over
the
top
but
this
is
actually
reserved
but
just
a
little
more
flavorful
than
the
typical
stout
the
body
is
surprising
thin
considering
the
color
im
not
always
a
dogfish
fan
since
im
not
always
impressed
with
over
the
top
for
over
the
tops
sake
but
this
is
a
tasty
beer
this
brew
poured
all
but
no
head
what
head
it
had
was
made
up
of
medium
sized
brown
bubbles
it
had
a
strong
malt
aroma
and
an
opaque
black
brown
body
it
was
smooth
initially
with
a
very
thick
mouth
feel
and
a
slight
bitterness
in
its
coffee
malt
finish
this
is
a
very
delectable
brew
one
i
would
very
much
like
to
have
again
though
the
beer
itself
doesnt
seem
to
truly
backup
the
intriguing
flavorful
promises
that
the
label
offered
to
entice
me
to
buy
this
6
pack
its
an
enjoyable
somewhat
sweet
moderately
rubust
stout
which
i
can
see
myself
trying
again
in
the
future
roasty
coffee
nose
and
opaque
black
in
color
if
you
like
the
smell
of
coffee
and
the
taste
of
roasted
malts
then
this
is
your
beer
alcohol
is
low
and
the
flavor
is
strong
with
licorice
tones
and
roasted
coffee
flavor
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
year
round
due
to
its
subtle
alcohol
and
flavors
as
advertised
chicory
stout
features
a
bone
white
head
that
sits
atop
a
dark
brown
liquid
that
displays
ruby
edges
when
held
to
light
its
head
is
thick
creamy
and
retains
itself
incredibly
well
the
nose
is
varied
with
notes
of
roasted
coffee
chocolate
some
hazelnut
and
tobacco
taste
is
diverse
as
well
big
notes
of
roasted
coffee
beans
chocolate
macadamia
nuts
and
spicy
hops
are
evident
the
overall
flavor
is
a
battle
between
sweet
and
robust
with
the
sweetness
of
the
chicory
and
malt
reigning
champion
over
the
roasty
coffee
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
the
finish
is
long
and
complex
as
would
be
expected
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
stout
this
is
a
unique
brew
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
dogfish
head
although
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
single
sitting
this
stout
is
a
very
nice
effort
overall
would
make
a
fine
dessert
beer
the
beer
pours
very
dark
with
a
nice
light
brown
head
chocolate
and
coffee
evident
in
the
aroma
the
chocolate
and
coffee
are
also
both
very
evident
to
the
taste
there
is
a
very
good
maly
roastiness
also
the
chicory
leaves
a
subtle
but
pleasing
taste
to
the
stout
a
good
mellowing
agent
these
guys
are
good
very
drinkable
this
is
an
enjoyable
stout
not
a
fabulous
stout
but
an
enjoyable
stout
originally
sampled
on
18
september
2002
i
am
writing
this
review
from
my
notes
this
is
a
light
bodied
dry
slightly
bitter
stout
its
nicely
balanced
its
better
than
average
but
not
great
it
is
dark
brown
almost
lack
in
color
w
a
slight
coffee
nose
f
this
was
fantastic
nose
was
very
faintly
smokey
and
lightly
roasty
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
licorice
and
coffee
tremendously
well
balanced
beer
on
the
dry
side
of
the
scale
and
an
irresistably
soft
texture
the
flavour
teases
rather
than
kicking
you
in
the
face
chocolate
subtle
roasty
coffee
bitterness
light
smoke
really
fantastic
i
could
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
one
session
beautiful
this
particular
stout
had
very
little
head
if
any
to
it
there
was
not
much
lacing
with
this
brew
at
all
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
it
had
a
nice
coffee
aroma
the
body
of
this
stout
was
brown
there
was
bitterness
noted
with
this
brew
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
i
had
this
one
in
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
black
with
2
fingers
of
tan
head
there
is
almost
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
mostly
of
roasted
coffee
it
is
a
nice
aroma
the
taste
is
fairly
strong
of
coffee
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
there
are
a
few
hops
present
but
this
is
mostly
a
malty
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
strong
the
drinkability
for
this
stout
is
good
too
at
only
5
2
when
poured
into
the
glass
the
color
was
black
with
some
red
highlights
on
the
edges
the
head
was
a
creamy
tan
color
that
did
not
last
long
and
formed
a
small
skim
over
the
top
and
a
tan
ring
around
the
edge
the
lace
that
was
left
behind
was
patchy
in
places
and
nonexistent
in
others
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
of
dark
malts
some
sweet
malts
dark
fruit
faint
coffee
chicory
and
a
hint
of
burnt
chocolate
the
aromas
seemed
to
be
more
complex
as
it
warmed
better
the
taste
was
very
similar
to
the
aromas
tastes
of
dark
and
sweet
malts
creamy
chocolate
roasted
coffee
chicory
dark
fruits
as
it
warmed
roasted
nuts
and
hints
of
alcohol
and
also
like
the
aroma
the
flavors
seemed
to
get
more
complex
as
the
temperature
rose
when
served
cold
it
is
not
too
bad
a
little
rough
but
when
allowed
to
warm
up
all
the
flavors
blended
together
to
produce
a
really
good
flavor
over
your
tongue
i
will
be
honest
when
served
fresh
from
the
tap
it
is
a
better
drink
but
the
bottle
version
is
still
good
pours
a
promising
nearly
opaque
with
a
brown
creamy
head
the
aroma
primarily
consists
of
chocolate
malt
and
creamed
coffee
mouthfeel
is
way
to
thin
for
a
stout
taste
consists
of
roasted
malt
with
coffee
undertones
bittersweet
throughout
and
lacks
smoothness
finish
is
very
dry
flavors
seem
to
be
balanced
between
themselves
but
they
dont
really
make
a
lasting
impression
taste
just
seems
to
fall
apart
on
the
palate
oddness
in
the
overall
flavor
also
dont
know
if
thats
the
chickory
overrated
in
my
book
poured
a
near
pitch
black
color
with
huge
oofwhite
head
i
had
to
wait
a
few
minutes
to
drink
it
so
the
head
could
go
downsmell
was
of
deep
roasted
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
taste
was
coffeeish
and
roasty
with
some
earthiness
lingering
in
there
as
well
a
nice
complex
stout
but
a
little
watery
it
is
slightly
different
then
the
bottle
i
had
a
few
months
ago
not
quite
as
chocolatynot
sure
if
this
was
an
older
bottle
or
a
different
recipe
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
creamy
head
and
moderate
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
coffee
and
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
possibly
some
roasted
malt
the
taste
was
not
to
my
liking
because
i
am
not
a
fan
of
coffee
but
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
very
solid
stout
if
you
like
coffee
and
you
like
stouts
this
beer
will
probably
please
you
but
because
of
my
dislike
for
coffee
i
have
to
give
it
just
a
moderate
grade
its
completely
opaque
with
a
pretty
small
head
the
aroma
is
pleasant
and
consists
of
sweet
roasted
malt
and
burnt
coffee
i
dont
know
what
chicory
tastes
like
but
i
didnt
find
any
flavors
that
stuck
out
as
something
i
have
never
tasted
i
simply
taste
a
solid
stout
with
emphasis
on
coffee
the
finish
is
great
with
an
awesome
clean
bitter
coffee
flavor
another
is
it
a
stout
or
is
it
a
porter
once
again
the
lines
blur
and
the
drinker
is
left
to
his
opinion
yes
it
poured
dark
with
great
chocolate
bubbles
yes
it
had
the
the
coffee
taste
and
a
slight
chicory
taste
but
it
also
had
the
sweetness
of
a
porter
whatever
this
beer
is
it
is
very
enjoyable
acquired
in
the
philly
gathering
beer
exchange
the
taste
is
a
solid
stout
flavor
with
a
nice
touch
of
mocha
it
seems
to
be
somewhat
one
dimensional
in
flavor
though
and
theres
not
much
hop
noticable
the
dryness
in
my
mouth
is
wonderful
the
stout
really
primes
you
for
another
drink
too
bad
winters
nearly
over
black
in
color
no
lace
aromas
of
coffee
eminate
greatly
tastes
of
coffee
also
are
great
wish
i
could
flavor
the
roasted
chicory
a
bit
more
not
a
bad
beer
in
my
opinion
went
well
with
a
steak
but
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
this
thing
without
some
sort
of
grilled
meat
product
drinkability
bitterness
and
lack
of
any
smoothness
really
penalize
the
drinkability
scores
a
little
to
harsh
for
me
worth
its
0
99
price
tag
not
too
bad
but
not
what
i
was
really
expecting
i
think
that
this
tastes
a
lot
like
guinness
off
tapwhich
i
really
dig
there
is
definately
a
heavy
coffee
smell
to
it
very
aromattic
the
color
was
a
dark
rich
black
color
that
let
no
light
through
it
the
head
didnt
last
long
at
all
the
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
unimpressive
dont
get
me
wrong
it
was
a
good
feeling
but
nothing
really
stood
out
to
me
i
would
buy
it
again
and
let
it
sit
for
a
little
bit
next
time
to
see
how
it
goes
drinkability
a
decent
stout
easier
to
put
away
a
few
of
these
because
of
the
comparatively
light
body
yes
sir
i
like
it
i
like
it
a
lot
it
pours
a
dark
midnight
black
color
upon
the
initial
pour
a
huge
rocky
head
presented
itself
then
over
a
period
of
about
5
minutes
it
faded
away
leaving
a
14inch
cap
and
several
thick
sticky
rings
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
full
of
coffee
and
chocolate
aromas
with
undertones
of
toasted
malt
no
hops
are
detected
there
is
also
a
nice
smokey
aroma
that
seems
to
push
its
way
through
the
first
flavor
that
hits
my
tongue
is
a
slight
bitterness
of
hops
ahh
there
they
are
the
next
thing
i
tasted
was
a
perfect
blend
of
rich
coffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
all
the
while
still
maintaining
that
same
smokey
quality
thats
in
the
aroma
there
was
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
on
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
too
bad
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
wellbalanced
beer
i
will
definitely
purchase
this
one
again
uhhh
i
have
never
seen
a
beer
or
poured
a
beer
with
this
amount
of
carbonation
as
soon
as
i
slowlypoured
it
into
the
glass
its
like
it
exploded
and
rose
all
the
way
to
the
top
almost
overflowing
id
say
i
have
at
least
a
good
three
inch
head
just
sitting
here
the
color
is
black
with
a
brownish
chunky
ice
cream
looking
head
after
a
good
five
minutes
ive
finally
got
the
whole
bottle
into
my
glass
i
dont
really
taste
or
smell
any
coffee
as
the
label
states
there
is
aroma
is
kind
of
weak
a
very
sweet
aroma
with
hints
of
raisinsmolassesand
chocolate
that
are
hard
to
make
out
an
extremely
crisp
mouthfeel
that
leaves
a
very
dry
finish
ok
now
i
taste
a
bit
of
coffee
a
little
taste
of
hops
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
that
lingers
not
a
real
distinct
flavor
that
presents
itself
a
sweet
taste
that
touches
of
raisinsmolassesand
coffee
a
different
type
of
stout
that
overall
good
to
very
good
tasted
030403
not
as
good
in
the
bottle
as
on
tap
pours
black
with
a
tan
head
this
head
is
in
no
way
bone
white
coffee
yuck
a
bit
too
much
coffee
and
complexity
going
on
throughout
this
brew
if
dogfish
tweeked
it
a
bit
this
could
become
a
classic
i
guess
id
like
this
beer
more
if
i
liked
coffee
id
rather
lick
the
outside
of
a
wws
bottle
chicory
stous
is
a
deep
dense
brown
color
but
doesnt
produce
much
head
the
smell
is
mouthwatering
however
the
flavor
fails
to
convey
the
expected
heaviness
and
live
up
to
the
initial
promise
somewhat
uneven
and
onedimensional
with
an
aftertaste
like
a
persistent
ringing
in
your
ear
overall
a
pleasant
stout
that
is
very
drinkable
i
only
wish
it
had
more
chicory
bitterness
and
flavor
so
as
to
stand
out
from
other
medium
body
coffee
stouts
this
is
a
stout
i
wasnt
to
impressed
with
it
other
then
its
appearance
and
smell
this
was
an
average
stout
but
since
its
a
dogfishhead
i
gave
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
color
was
very
dark
brown
and
had
a
solid
froth
of
light
tan
hues
smell
was
nice
little
smokey
some
hop
presence
cocoa
and
grainy
wild
rice
maybe
taste
was
a
little
watery
and
not
solid
enough
for
a
stout
for
me
it
has
some
smokey
grain
coffee
thing
going
on
nice
hints
but
not
enough
for
an
eyebrow
raise
felt
a
bit
creamy
and
finished
a
tad
lighter
then
i
was
expecting
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
a
hint
of
smoked
grain
or
cocoa
lingers
its
just
below
a
good
stout
in
my
book
could
be
bolder
and
thicker
actually
wouldnt
serve
bad
for
a
summer
stout
good
stout
not
great
or
anything
special
the
label
boasts
a
bone
white
head
which
in
reality
doesnt
exist
im
getting
hints
of
the
chicory
i
can
detect
the
hops
underneath
all
that
smokiness
i
once
primed
a
homebrew
stout
batch
with
chicory
coffee
cafe
du
monde
and
it
actually
came
out
pretty
close
to
this
im
getting
an
alcohol
presence
on
the
nose
deep
rich
and
unique
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me
but
i
like
it
mmmm
coffee
mmmmm
beer
mmmmmm
coffee
and
beer
pours
a
ver
dark
amber
practically
black
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
lace
is
definitely
forming
in
rings
to
my
glass
here
pretty
good
head
retention
for
something
with
whole
mexican
coffee
beans
i
heard
its
really
hard
to
pull
off
the
aroma
here
is
primarily
in
your
face
eye
opener
of
coffee
beans
a
whiff
of
chocolate
tones
dark
roasts
and
a
very
light
hop
aroma
is
hidden
in
there
the
taste
is
primarily
a
sharp
bitterness
of
harsh
roasted
malt
and
hops
with
the
softer
flavors
taking
the
back
seat
coffee
cream
and
chicory
its
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
brewery
capable
of
wws
two
different
worlds
i
know
but
even
the
body
is
too
light
here
i
am
just
not
digging
this
one
it
is
not
very
drinkable
for
well
balanced
flavor
or
catching
a
nice
buzz
the
aroma
is
the
best
thing
this
beers
got
going
for
it
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
amber
almost
black
color
it
formed
a
foamy
light
tan
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
was
present
it
had
an
aroma
of
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
malt
chocolate
and
bitter
coffee
or
else
that
was
the
chicory
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
of
the
best
ones
i
know
people
who
love
it
but
i
think
there
are
others
that
do
this
style
better
packaged
in
date2
appearance
pours
a
dark
black
color
and
the
head
is
creamy
sticky
dense
rocky
and
is
cardboard
in
color
on
the
nose
the
aroma
of
chicory
and
coffee
dark
toasted
bread
dark
chocolates
hints
of
charcoal
and
roasted
grains
on
the
palate
the
flavors
consisted
of
sweet
coffee
malt
sweetness
dark
chocolate
little
hop
bitterness
slight
charcoal
flavor
a
little
buttery
toffee
and
toasted
dark
bread
i
enjoyed
this
stout
unquestionably
distinctive
and
unique
brew
this
beer
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
not
much
head
fading
to
a
14
inch
collar
but
a
little
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
it
seems
chocolate
and
coffee
preside
on
the
nose
as
well
as
roasted
malt
then
the
first
sip
confirms
the
chocolate
coffee
roasted
malt
and
something
that
seems
to
be
a
little
spicey
a
little
tart
i
dont
know
if
its
chicory
as
i
have
never
tasted
it
but
theres
something
different
there
a
little
short
and
dry
on
the
mouthfeel
and
finish
one
or
two
is
enough
for
me
good
stout
but
missing
something
in
the
end
pours
deep
brown
almost
balck
but
just
a
hint
of
light
passes
has
a
finger
thick
cream
colored
head
that
is
very
persistent
and
leaves
a
touch
of
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
quite
appealing
coffee
roast
malt
and
an
aroma
that
i
can
only
guess
is
chicory
kind
of
reminds
me
of
sasparilla
the
flavor
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
roast
malt
is
present
but
not
very
prominent
then
some
molasses
followed
by
a
slightly
sour
flavor
and
the
finish
gave
the
impression
that
i
was
sucking
on
a
wood
chip
it
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
quite
dry
and
a
little
on
the
thin
side
this
is
an
interesting
effort
but
it
falls
a
little
short
in
my
opinion
it
is
good
and
drinkable
just
isnt
all
it
could
be
the
appearance
was
a
little
disappointing
i
was
thinking
ok
stout
super
dark
and
thick
it
had
almost
no
head
when
advertised
to
have
a
bone
white
head
i
would
say
it
was
more
tan
it
was
also
a
dark
brown
with
amber
highlights
when
backlit
the
aroma
was
of
malt
bitter
coffee
stench
earthy
and
i
wanna
say
tree
bark
the
taste
was
close
to
the
aroma
with
more
wood
attributes
it
was
like
sipping
something
brewed
on
a
wood
burning
stove
or
bbq
it
had
touches
of
maple
as
was
almost
no
hop
pretty
thin
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
with
a
dry
not
impressively
sweet
malt
finish
nothing
great
but
with
the
thinness
of
this
stout
unlike
most
stouts
i
could
drink
many
of
them
at
at
sitting
oelergud
chocolate
and
so
much
more
like
vanilla
bananas
nuts
coffee
loads
of
dark
but
sweet
flavors
one
solid
stout
very
mellow
beautiful
and
tasty
as
they
come
an
utterly
unique
invention
the
chicory
stout
poured
a
solid
nearblack
color
with
hints
of
dark
brown
when
studied
in
the
light
a
generous
head
formed
and
settled
to
a
consistent
14inch
thick
layer
this
nice
appearance
was
complemented
well
by
a
very
interesting
aroma
roasted
coffeelike
characteristics
and
strong
malt
presence
were
detected
along
with
a
deep
candy
or
licorice
scent
not
knowing
what
chicory
actually
smells
like
im
guessing
this
was
it
the
strong
smell
actually
set
me
up
for
a
little
bit
of
a
disappointment
heavy
dark
maltiness
came
through
in
the
taste
along
with
the
licorice
or
chicory
detected
earlier
but
the
end
result
was
a
somewhat
weak
stout
a
decent
taste
but
a
little
dry
and
very
little
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
definitely
a
little
too
light
for
my
taste
in
a
stout
too
while
the
addition
of
chicory
made
this
stout
interesting
i
prefer
a
heavier
more
traditionally
flavored
brew
for
the
style
worth
trying
but
not
sure
if
stocking
up
would
be
ideal
a
ton
of
sweet
malts
in
this
brew
color
is
very
dark
brown
and
head
is
small
and
tan
appearance
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
coca
cola
the
carbonation
is
very
light
and
body
is
full
no
discernable
hopiness
to
this
brew
but
like
i
said
before
there
are
a
ton
of
sweet
malts
it
also
has
almost
a
candy
aftertaste
that
left
me
with
a
jagermeisterlikeaftertaste
but
only
to
a
much
lesser
extent
good
but
nothing
to
rant
and
rave
about
here
this
stout
poured
from
a
12
oz
amber
bottle
to
give
a
dark
brown
translucent
beer
with
thick
rich
tan
foam
that
stayed
forever
the
aroma
was
very
interesting
there
was
a
faint
smell
of
sweet
malt
and
something
candylike
perhaps
chicory
the
taste
was
strong
with
the
flavors
of
bitter
coffee
and
chicory
dominating
but
also
a
faint
licorice
taste
as
well
as
some
small
amount
of
hops
the
flavor
was
dry
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
and
airy
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lingering
bitter
aftertaste
the
drinkability
was
good
for
this
lightbodied
stout
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
after
trying
dogfish
heads
world
wide
stout
and
brown
ale
it
poured
black
with
a
very
thin
wispy
head
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
coffee
so
far
so
good
once
in
the
mouth
however
i
was
immediately
let
down
by
the
watery
body
the
flavors
are
all
suggestive
of
a
hearty
brew
a
sweet
toffeelike
malt
up
front
followed
by
roasted
malt
flavors
and
a
mild
slightly
woody
taste
from
the
chicory
i
assume
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
very
mild
grainy
and
woody
bitterness
lingers
on
in
a
fairly
pleasant
aftertaste
drinkable
but
not
memorable
i
dont
really
care
for
this
one
this
deep
brown
almost
black
beer
pours
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
recedes
to
nothing
in
short
order
the
aroma
is
somewhat
hoppy
with
roasted
coffee
notes
the
first
taste
is
big
on
the
coffee
with
some
roasted
malt
behind
it
subsequent
sips
reveal
more
malty
sweetness
while
the
coffee
notes
subside
a
bit
there
is
also
some
nice
hop
bitterness
to
balance
out
all
the
strong
roastiness
from
the
chicory
and
the
malt
the
body
is
rather
light
reminding
me
more
of
a
lager
than
a
stout
the
finish
leaves
nothing
on
the
tongue
while
the
aftertaste
has
a
touch
of
hops
and
some
lingering
coffee
notes
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
drinks
rather
easily
perhaps
a
bit
more
maltiness
would
balance
this
beer
a
little
better
a
decent
beer
worth
enjoying
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
different
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
arrangement
of
dark
malts
with
a
great
roastiness
throughout
it
has
nice
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
that
dominate
but
there
is
a
lot
of
sweetness
to
it
also
it
is
very
rich
and
creamy
smooth
just
a
great
stout
to
drink
its
not
one
that
i
would
buy
again
though
for
the
price
there
are
much
better
stouts
out
there
for
my
liking
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
stoutlike
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
are
the
dominant
flavors
here
a
tad
thin
for
a
stout
and
it
could
use
some
more
hop
flavor
although
there
is
some
present
nothing
stellar
but
certainly
an
above
average
stout
caskconditioned
primed
with
maple
syrup
and
with
honey
rum
oak
chips
from
their
distillery
added
to
the
cask
hazy
mahogany
in
color
with
very
little
head
limited
aroma
the
body
is
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
low
but
its
quite
smooth
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
offers
a
soft
maltiness
with
a
mild
maple
syrup
note
its
very
dry
and
lightly
astringent
the
rum
character
is
quite
clear
one
of
the
more
interesting
characteristics
is
a
mild
roastiness
that
almost
appears
smoky
in
the
finish
as
it
combines
with
the
alcohol
notes
of
the
rum
a
totally
different
beer
from
the
bottled
version
absolutely
unique
a
nice
experiment
but
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
hit
the
mark
still
its
probably
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
a
cask
of
it
as
it
is
so
remarkably
different
drinkability
o
k
for
what
it
is
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
of
these
but
at
the
same
time
i
wouldnt
pass
on
it
if
one
was
placed
in
front
of
me
it
just
doesnt
hold
my
attention
there
are
far
better
stouts
out
there
an
ok
beer
but
there
are
better
stouts
to
be
had
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
after
having
tried
the
dogfish
immort
ale
tasted
at
the
barrelhouse
brewing
company
microbrew
fest
on
november
9
i
still
have
not
had
the
wws
yet
but
this
seemed
like
a
good
leadin
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
little
head
and
lacing
roasted
coffee
flavor
with
a
dry
finish
not
as
good
as
the
other
beers
i
have
tried
from
dogfish
head
but
not
a
bad
stout
very
dark
deep
brown
almost
black
ink
in
appearance
strong
coffee
aroma
a
strong
chicory
presence
throughout
reminded
me
of
the
chicory
coffee
sold
throughout
new
orleans
roasted
coffeechicory
flavor
with
highlights
of
barkwoodsy
tones
light
body
poured
with
a
very
thin
head
overall
a
nice
stout
more
along
the
lines
of
a
coffee
porter
clear
but
very
dark
color
a
little
ruby
at
the
bottom
respectable
head
of
12
inch
of
tan
with
some
brown
streaks
aroma
of
malted
milk
ok
body
and
mouthfeel
just
a
speck
of
coffee
flavor
overlaying
a
dark
caramel
tone
i
was
surprised
at
the
lack
of
dark
roasted
coffee
and
other
bolder
flavors
this
beer
is
pleasant
drinkable
but
ultimately
disappointing
in
its
lack
of
depth
and
flavor
this
stout
has
a
nice
thick
lasting
head
and
deep
brown
color
which
interestingly
is
revealed
ad
bright
red
color
when
held
up
to
a
light
the
aroma
of
this
one
is
hard
to
place
there
is
a
malty
dark
deep
malty
waft
and
what
my
brother
described
as
a
spice
that
belongs
on
red
meat
this
one
has
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
for
the
style
definitely
different
but
not
something
i
would
try
again
from
a
bottle
stout
more
like
a
mocha
porter
the
addition
of
coffee
made
this
too
thin
to
be
a
stout
this
beer
tastes
pretty
good
but
got
a
low
review
from
me
due
to
the
adjuncts
used
i
hate
it
when
brewers
add
coffee
or
chocolate
to
get
a
desired
flavor
these
flavors
can
be
acheived
by
the
types
and
amount
of
malts
used
like
sn
porter
or
rogue
shakespear
stout
also
i
dont
want
my
beer
to
be
drugged
with
caffiene
at
least
the
description
on
the
bottle
stated
that
it
had
coffee
added
unlike
some
other
beers
bottle
claims
bone
white
head
but
actually
its
quite
tan
and
shortlived
interesting
stout

before

even

tasted

hefty

left
only
a

quickly
dissipating
collar
of
foam
it
looked
pretty
thin
too
opaque
almost
a
dark
autumn
amber
when
i
returned
to
my
seat
i
realized
that
i
could
smell
the
deep
roasted
malt
and
quality
coffee
from
3
feet
away
very
inviting
the
taste
wasnt
what
i
would
expect
from
the
style
almost
espresso
like
if
coffe
is
your
style
then
this
is
your
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
disappointing
thin
and
free
of
any
carbonation
overall
a
mediocre
brew
i
would
however
strongly
recommend
it
to
my
friends
who
love
that
that
inyourface
coffee
taste
thought
this
was
good
stuff
good
beer
overall
coffee
smell
is
great
but
a
little
off
in
the
taste
a
little
too
thin
for
my
taste
in
stouts
a
good
thin
coffee
stout
not
really
much
else
to
say
its
low
abv
and
mouthfeel
make
more
like
a
coffee
porter
its
not
bad
at
all
just
not
very
complex
nice
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavors
light
carbonation
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
all
in
all
a
tasty
brew
i
dont
know
if
i
would
seek
this
out
to
purchase
on
its
own
but
i
always
enjoy
the
two
bottles
that
come
in
lakefronts
box
of
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
solid
coffee
stout
will
not
seek
out
and
purchase
again
good
but
there
are
other
coffee
stouts
that
i
can
get
much
easier
very
similar
to
coffee
bender
from
surly
ratings
on
this
beer
do
not
do
it
justice
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavors
mix
well
resulting
in
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
will
pickup
again

i
liked
this
here
beer
expected
coffee
scent
and
flavor
but
minimal
identity
past
that
extremely
thin
and
watery
o
a
very
drinkable
stout
little
indication
of
the
presence
of
coffee
other
than
in
the
initial
aroma
but
a
solid
example
of
the
stout
style
perhaps
age
muted
the
coffee
flavor
final
thoughts
another
decent
stout
with
added
coffee
sort
of
a
popular
style
these
days
would
i
drink
it
again
meh
o
pretty
good
coffee
stout
plenty
of
coffee
plenty
of
roast
malt
just
about
what
youd
expect
from
an
aboveaverage
tasty
coffee
stout
this
packs
more
flavour
than
our
more
local
new
glarus
coffee
stout
but
it
hits
you
a
little
bit
more
quickly
surprising
that
it
isnt
as
wellreceived
as
id
expect
based
on
my
review
but
then
again
lakefront
has
a
tendency
to
be
underrated

o
very
nice
coffee
stout
i
particularly
like
the
pricing
point

for
the
bottle
at
copper
vine
while
not
a
deal
breaker
for
me
the
usda
organic
stamp
is
a
bonus
maybe
not
quite
up
to
the
bells
or
dark
horse
versions
but
very
drinkable
great
aroma
and
a
descent
tasting
beer
i
like
it
very
well
its
from

wi
tried
this
on
the
nitro
tap
at
the
brewery

not
a
beer
id
buy
again
but
it
was
an
interesting
tryout
i
get
an
image
of
sitting
by
a
fire
on
a
cold
winters
night
drinking
this
beer
with
family
and
friends
but
of
course
theres
winter
lagers
for
that
coffee
coffee
coffee
the
over
powering
smell
of
coffe
the
overpowering
taste
of
coffe
thats
all
i
can
say
it
gags
me
i
cant
get
tatse
out
of
my
mouth
i
got
nothing
more
to
say
about
it
skip
it
and
try
another
beer
they
make
others
but
this
one
doesnt
work
for
me
the
coffee
lingers
too
long
in
my
mouth
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
for
a
stout
with
active
carbonation
playing
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
very
disappointing
brew
the
lack
of
coffee
presence
and
the
lack
of
complexities
in
the
stout
as
a
whole
make
it
something
not
really
worth
drinking
overall
fuel
cafe
delivers
on
the
promise
of
an
accessible
coffee
beer
and
it
works
but
doesnt
take
it
to
the
next
level
like
some
gourmet
coffee
brews
barrel
aging
or
adding
more
quality
ingredients
could
really
develop
this
one
into
something
special

not

be

coffee
stout
dark

with

this
beverage
the
khaki
colored

quickly
dissipates
to
the
point
that
it
only
just
covers
the
majority
of
the
top
aroma
is
faint
but
is
a
blend
of
roasted
barley
and
coffee
the
flavor
is
predominantly
bitter
dark
roasted
coffee
and
yet
the
back
of
the
palate
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
end
with
plum
like
notes
the
mouth
is
a
bit
oily
and
viscous
if
you
like
coffee
and
beer
and
coffee
stouts
youll
enjoy
the
drinkability
of
this
one
dont
expect
to
be
wowed
with

still
taste
a

of

no

just
the

is
that
the

the

seem
buried

only
a

this
one
is
missing
the
stout
i
was
jonesing
for
a
coffee
stout
tonight
and
wanting
something
new
so
i
bought
this
i
got
home
saw
the
score
and
became
disappointed
immediately
but
jumped
in
with
an
open
mind
imo
this
brew
is
soooo
underrated
this
is
a
straight
forward
no
frills
no
nonsense
coffee
brown
although
it
claims
stout
only
two
things
hold
this
back
for
meone
is
the
sweetener
aftertaste
and
the
other
is
the
thin
structure
but
hey
neither
bother
me
this
you
can
literally
have
in
the
morning
and
get
a
nice
buzz
to
carry
youif
you
were
inclined
to
do
so
hell
mikkeller
could
put
this
brew
in
bourbon
barrels
for
a
week
and
sell
this
for
about
6
bucks
12oz
and
receive
accoladesi
think
you
get
my
point
this
fuel

at
a
great

the

slightly
acidic
coffee
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
coffee
presence
is
better
in
the
smell
in
my
opinion
i
had
this
on
nitro
it
was
pretty
good
when
a
stout
is
on
nitro
the
coffee
taste
stands
out
my
girlfriend
didnt
try
this
one
she
pouted
and
got
mad
we
went
to
comet
cafe
after
this
and
i
bought
her
a
canvas
bag
this
kind
of
changed
her
mood
overall
generally
i
cant
see
why
this
beer
is
rated
as
low
as
it
is
here
its
a
solid
offering
but
one
that
could
use
just
a
little
tweaking
more
roasted
malt
would
really
make
this
beer
take
the
cake
there
just
isnt
enough
stout
happening
in
this
beer
for
me
an
offering
with
a
higher
proportion
of
roastedsmoked
malt
would
make
this
one
golden
o
the
first
time
i
had
this
was
at
the
brickskeller
in
dc
and
it
holds
some
nostalgia
for
that
reason
although
even
at
that
time
i
knew
there
were
much
better
coffee
stouts
out
there
coming
back
to
it
i
appreciate
fuel
for
what
it
is
as
an
easy
drinking
stout
with
some
coffee
flavor
it
is
worth
trying
it

o
i

this

so
poorly
i
thought
the

were
great
it
was
pretty

other
than
that
i
enjoyed
it

o
i
would
prefer
it
to
be
a

overall
it
is
a
good

the
carbonation
was
surprisingly
stronger
than
expected

it
didnt
take
away
from
the

it
doesnt
punch

i
will
not

with
a
watery
taste
beer
is
carbonated
heavily
but
full

goes
down
smooth
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
this
american
coffee
stout
poured
a
dark
brown
color
produced
an
average
tan
head
average
retention
and
it
left
some
lacing
on
the

the
aroma
consisted
of
prune
juice
and
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
beans
aroma
was
underwhelming
medium
bodied
there
is
a
flavor
of
dark
fruit
and
some
hints
of
coffee
to
thin
for
my
liking
there
are
much
better
quality
coffee
stouts
i
would
not
purchase
this
again
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
not
glamorous
but
good
id
seek
this
one
out
on
draught
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
just
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
coffee
stout
look
no
further
this
is
quite
good
its
one
of
two
that
ive
had
and
i
couldnt
pick
which
one
i
liked
more
so
id
say
try
this
if
you
want
to
get
into
it
i
will
say
if
you
dont
like
the
flavor
of
coffee
do
not
try
this
because
you
wont
like
it
that
being
said
i
think
its
fairly
accessible
i
found
it
at
my
local
friar
tucks
in
fenton
enjoy
fuel
cafe
pours
a
black
color
with
a

a

roasted

a

a

overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
far
far
superior
coffee
stouts
out
there
this
one
just
doesnt
do
a
whole

a
solid
black

with
a
small
bubbly

that
dissipates
rather
quickly
smells
of
slightly
acrid

with
a
hint

else
the
flavor
is
an
assault
of
java
with
a
roasty
malt
edge
light
burnt
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
malts
attempt
to
provide
some
balance
but
arent
strong
enough

up

the
unrelenting

bean
medium
to
thin

carbonation
and
a

ashy

decent
enough
coffee
bomb
but
really
could
use
a
bit
more
body
and
sweetness
to
help
stand
up
to
the
acrid
and
thinning
effects
of
the
coffee
overall
pretty
nice
american
stout
coffee
bitterness
is
a
bit
much
but
it
is
still
an
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
o
not
very
good
not
a
beer
i
would
ever
buy
or
order
on
tap
if
it
were
available
o
the
weakest
beer
ive
had
from
lakefront
maybe
it
would
be
better
fresh
right
now
it
tastes
like
old
coffee
grounds
overall
not
worth
a
repeated
purchase
but
a
great
gateway
to
someone
who
wants
to
try
a
coffee
stout
o
this
is
an
awesome
espresso
stout
i
wish
i
could
buy
this
by
the
case
but
since
im
huddled
away
in
a
whole
in
montana
thisll
have
to
do
the
most
concentrated
espresso
flavor
ive
had
yet
in
a
beer
good
job
lakefront
always
a
fan
of
your
brews
o
not
terrible
but
not
something
id
have
again
a
lot
better
offerings
out
there
definitely
an
interesting
take
on
a
coffee
stout
o
not
horrible
and
maybe
hurt
a
little
by
age
but
i
still
think
this
is
simply
an
average
to
below
average
beer
because
of
the
number
of
offflavors
and
lack
of
substantive
body
correct
me
if
you
feel
i
am
wrong
about
this
but
as
a
rule
i
expect
stouts
to
be
of
a
heavier
mouthfeel
than
porters
even
though
both
can
be
a
dense
opaque
black
this
stout
pours
a
beautiful
chocolately
opaque
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
ive
had
many
porters
like
this
but
very
few
stouts
it
seems
misnamed
as
a
stout
i
would
give
it
a
lower
grade
than
if
it
were
classified
as
a
porter
as
a
stout
it
lacked
the
expected
body
and
malty
flavor
where
as
a
porter
it
had
a
very
sweet
finish
too
sweet
for
me
billed
as
coffee
flavored
stout
i
was
wondering
where
the
coffee
went
i
am
an
avid
coffee
drinker
and
i
did
not
get
the
delivery
of
coffee
at
all
while
many
stouts
deliver
strong
espresso
aftertastes
as
a
homebrewer
i
know
how
it
is
to
miss
your
intended
style
and
this
one
to
me
is
more
at
porter
or
a
black
belgian
ale
style
than
a
stout
classification
if
i
were
to
rate
this
beer
in
a
style
class
of
choice
i
would
have
the
highest
probable
rating
for
this
beer
in
the
belgian
ale
classification
with
a
judged
complexity
of
sweetsour
notes
and
finishing
notably
sour
overall
while
there
was
much
in
the
nose
that
was
excellent
the
flavors
were
much
weaker
on
the
tongue
and
were
largely
washed
out
by
coffee
the
watery
mouthfeel
does
not
help
here
giving
the
impression
of
someone
trying
to
disguise
a
weak
porter
with
a
bevy
of
coffee
grounds
and
even
the
coffee
grounds
arent
terribly
flavorful
equivalent
to
perhaps
preground
folgers
as
opposed
to
freshground
peets
better
ingredients
and
a
better
recipe
including
several
more
pounds
of
good
malt
would
have
done
much
to
make
this
beer
more
rounded
and
flavorful
maybe
its
because
i
drank
this
while
eating
a
chewy
chocolate
brownie
but
i
loved
this
beer
super
match
anyway
that
was
tonight
but
i
also
had
this
a
few
months
ago
with
a
cobb
salad
and
that
was
a
delicious
match
as
well
its
a
simple
stout
and
seems
like
a
great
choice
with
food
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thin
creamy
dark
brown
head
aromas
of
chocolate
ice
cream
taste
begins
with
a
bit
of
acidic
coffee
bean
flavor
followed
by
some
schwarzbrot
flavor
then
a
bit
of
earthy
chocolate
finish
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
bland
overall
an
average
stout
pretty
light
tasting
for
how
strong
it
is
hops
zeus
the
taste
has
a
burst
of
fresh
brewed
coffee
flavor
with
a
choclate
coming
after
i
also
pick
up
some
roasted
malt
flavor
i
dont
detect
any
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
well
balanced
and
rolls
off
the
tongue
very
well
not
to
thick
or
to
thin
overall
this
is
a
a
good
coffee
stout
this
one
would
be
great
with
dessert
or
at
dinner
with
a
coffee
dust
steak
o
a
decent
beer
not
a
whole
lot
of
coffee
flavor
but
the
brew
seems
to
be
balanced
nicely
and
is
enjoyable
i
enjoyed
this
one
much
more
than
i
expected
becoming
a
fan
of
lakefront
between
this
and
their
ipa
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
but
if
you
are
going
to
advertise
as
a
coffee
flavored
stout
i
would
expect
a
stronger
coffee
flavor
or
stout
flavor
o
a
most
enjoyable
offering
from
lakefront
but
i
really
love
having
my
coffee
in
the
morning
and
strong
therefore
it
made
complete
sense
that
i
enjoyed
this
stout
the
infusion
of
coffee
is
a
great
coffee
bean
flavor
without
the
bitterness
a
must
try
if
youre
a
stout
lover

d
its
not
an
outstanding
beer
but
its
passable
for
a
coffee
stout
i
dont
understand
all
the
hate
medium
to
light
bodied
stout
very
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
bad
showing
here
the
beer
doesnt
taste
like
coffee
and
the
other
characteristics
dont
compensate
for
this
i
like
coffee
beers
and
this
really
delivers
on
coffe
flavor
but
lacks
any
depth
it
comes
across
like
a
cold
pot
of
coffee
with
a
mere
wisp
of
beer
ill
be
taking
my
beer
dollars
elsewhere
overall
this
coffee
stout
is
serviceable
and
they
would
be
very
easy
to
throw
back
one
after
the
other
however
if
flavor
and
a
quality
feel
are
what
you
are
looking
for
it
would
be
best
to
get
your
java
fix
from
somewhere
else

tastes
of

hints
of

which
is
nice
and
unexpected
bringing
out
some
sour
notes
black
coffee
and
dirt
feels
light
bodied
which
i
dont
really
like
for
my
stouts
this
rich
in
flavor
very
fizzy
and
watery
on
the
roof
of
the
mouth
this
was
the
perfect
midnight
snack
something
to
quench
my
thirst
and
something
sweet
at
the
same
time
not
a
great
stout
style
but
the
taste
and
flavor
are
definitely
there
this
beer
pours
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
a
thin
lacing
its
aroma
is
of
coffee
with
hints
of
smoke
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
leads
with
coffee
followed
through
by
a
dark
chocolate
sweetness
and
faint
nut
notes
the
flavor
is
light
medium

fuel
cafe
coffee
flavored
stout
is
a
good
beer
smooth
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
recommended
fuel
cafe
is
a
very
dark
nearly
black
beer
with
a
small
tan
head
its
looks
clearly
like
a
stout
the
smell
is
good
a
medium
intensity
of
coffee
and
roasted
grain
no
real
hop
scents
although
there
is
a
wood
and
charcoal
scent
mingled
with
dark
malt
the
beer
is
dryish
with
a
malt
and
coffee
flavor
and
only
moderate
bitterness
medium
in
body
it
does
have
a
little
oillike
slickness
and
some
sharp
edges
drinkable
and
good
but
far
from
great
m
suprisingly
watery
good
coating
decent
aftertaste
lacking
some
of
the
bitterness
youd
expect
o
overall
i
believe
the
best
word
to
describe
this
brew
is
mild
highly
drinkable
and
contains
the
flavors
one
may
desire
but
there
is
no
boldness
in
any
category
to
speak
of
i
will
not
be
purchasing
any
more
as
i
feel
there
are
a
number
of
coffee
porters
that
outclass
this
one
notes
solidly
drinkable
top
to
bottom
cheers
o
for
the
price
this
wasnt
bad
i
would
probably
skip
it
next
time
though
just
nothing
really
special
about
it
o
inoffensive
easy
drinking
but
not
worth
paying
considering
that
its
craft
and
you
actually
have
to
pay
for
it
sierra
nevada
stout
on
the
other
hand
worth
every
penny
o
excellent
coffee
stout
really
rich
with
multiple
flavor
levels
and
complexity
really
nice
not
too
dry
at
the
end
which
is
exceptional
o
a
very
average
to
below
average
coffee
stout
that
i
just
didnt
get
sorry
pours
dark
with
a
thick
tan
head
looks
pretty
nice
at
first
but
dissipates
fast
smell
has
some
coffee
some
roast
some
malts
nothing
crazy
taste
is
very
blah
nothing
much
going
on
coffee
is
just
an
undertone
feels
watery
and
is
just
too
thin
the
one
i
had
must
have
been
better
than
the
one
you
did
because
mine
was
fantastic
o
tasty
but
it
hit
a
bit
below
the
mark
for
me
the
fragrance
and
taste
both
seemed
a
bit
too
subtle
for
what
the
name
and
appearance
suggested
very
chocolatey
with
a
good
coffee
flavor
but
neither
were
sufficiently
strong
enough
for
my
liking
it
tasted
surprisingly
mild
for
such
a
dark
beer
which
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
in
my
opinion
just
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
in
the
end
i
feel
it
is
worth
drinking
as
long
as
youre
not
expecting
too
much
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
black
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
the
lacing
wasnt
too
bad
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
full
of
coffee
and
other
roasted
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
good
amount
of
coffee
flavoring
along
with
some
chocolate
bitterness
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
average
there
wasnt
too
much
in
way
of
complexity
in
this
brew
overall
its
ok
but
i
wouldnt
have
to
buy
it
again
overall
this
is
a
substandard
beer
i
purchased
this
bottle
in
kansas
city
a
market
that
has
numerous
other
coffee
stouts
that
are
better
schlaflys
comes
to
mind
immediately
let
alone
imperial
stouts
like
founders
breakfast
stout
this
beer
is
kind
of
incoherent
id
avoid
it
o
the
weak
coffee
flavor
makes
this
a
disappointing
brew
the
thin
body
makes
it
feel
like
a
light
ale
with
dark
color
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
sam
adams
glass
pours
opaque
black
head

are
lacking
coffee
toffee
and
alcohol
aroma
coffee
is
very
present
in
the
flavor
masking
the
lack
of
significant
stout
complexity
very
thin
mouthfeel
coffee
aspect
is
not
bad
without
it
you
have
a
really
wimpy
stout
o
if
anythings
wrong
with
the
beer
its
that
it
has
a
bit
of
an
identity
problem
since
it
claims
to
have
mainly
coffee
flavor
when
it
exhibits
more
of
a
chocolaty
tendency
other
than
that
its
not
especially
exciting
but
i
guess
they
cant
all
wow
ya
aroma
of
burnt
coffee
appearance
was
a
dark
ruddy
brown
with
a
pale
beige
head
head
lasted
about
3
seconds
and
droped
to
an
oily
slick
no
lacing
taste
of
acidic
chocolate
and
burnt
french
roast
coffee
funky
biting
aftertaste
why
do
brewers
keep
trying
to
mix
beer
and
coffee
o
something
missed
the
mark
here
not
horrible
but
not
much
coffee
presence
and
not
much
else
going
on
with
this
beer
would
not
try
again
poured
into
standard
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
deep
rich
chocolate
tinted
black
the
dark
cream
head
dissipates
to
a
wisp
with
a
ring
of
cocoa
cream
bubbles
around
the
edges
light
lacing
smells
delicious
milk
chocolate
and
cocoa
burnt
malts
this
beer
tastes
like
it
smells
a
real
milky
chocolate
comes
through
and
finishes
with
a
dry
bitter
chocolate
malt
note
its
sweet
too
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
for
the
american
stout
style
overall
a
really
delicious
beer
its
not
cloyingly
sweet
but
enough
to
be
a
dessert
beer
easily
drinkable
and
very
milkchocolatey
the
aroma
was
just
loaded
down
with
coffee
rich
notes
of
mocha
mixes
in
with
a
rich
and
sweet
coffee
note
a
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
and
an
earthy
flare
lying
down
underneath
of
it
but
the
majority
of
this
one
was
hands
down
rich
brewed
coffee
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
rich
notes
just
rolled
over
the
tongue
in
waves
and
thoroughly
coated
the
inside
of
the
mouth
sweet
with
touches
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
to
highlight
the
coffee
notes
o
just
an
average
beer
or
maybe
a
little
below
average
id
pass
overall
not
a
horrible
beer
but
not
a
lot
of
bold
flavors
going
here
a
thin
stout
with
a
dash
of
coffee
if
you
like
drinking
black
coffee
though
youll
love
this
id
also
like
to
add
that
the
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
so
that
was
nice
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
nowhere
near
a
drain
pour
but
not
something
id
ever
spend
17
for
a
6er
waaayyy
over
priced
in
this
part
of
the
world
i
enjoy
coffee
flavoured
stouts
but
this
one
was
too
much
coffee
and
not
enough
stout
the
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
the
lack
of
a
smooth
mouthfeel
really
decreased
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
i
could
barely
finish
one
let
think
of
buying
a
six
pack
o
i
almost
want
the
label
to
say
a
coffee
brewed
with
stout
rather
than
the
other
way
around
still
a
decent
beer
but
damn
so
much
coffee
if
i
recall
correctly
this
was
8
99
a
6pak
at
total
wine
well
priced
i
am
liking
lakefront
brewery
more
more
o
this
is
a
good
coffee
stout
and
a
fine
way
to
start
the
day
i
wouldve
liked
some
more
complexity
but
if
youre
a
coffee
lover
this
would
be
quite
enjoyable
o
the
overall
impression
i
got
from
this
brew
is
a
lighter
more
approachable
morning
coffee
brew
with
a
lower
abv
for
style
and
a
lighter
easy
drinking
character
i
wouldnt
say
that
this
brew
defines
the
style
but
is
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
not
too
good
i
doubt
i
will
revisit
this
one
m

a

overall
this

a

with
a
healthy

of
french
roasted

served

but
the
flavor
profiles
are
only
partially
integrated

by

medium

like
to
see
the
coffee
amped
up
a
little
on
this
but
not
bad
easy
to
drink
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
extraordinary
i
have
had
coffee
stouts
that
really
tasted
burnt
and
others
that
have
gone
the
opposite
direction
by
going
all
frappucino
give
lakefront
credit
for
doing
neither
however
the
beer
was
a
bit
bitter
yet
and
the
consistency
was
little
gritty
nevertheless
a
pretty
good
drink
m
medium
body
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
stout
one
that
doesnt
quite
fit
the
coffee
billing
to
me
but
its
interesting
in
other
ways
there
are
certainly
redeeming
qualities
here
but
if
i
want
a
coffee
stout
im
usually
going
to
reach
for
something
a
bit
bigger
and
a
bit
more
coffeeish
o
its
a
gooood
coffee
stout
worth
the
try
medium
body
but
bitterness
prexominates
interesting
flavors
are
pleasant
but
also
a
little
too
delicate
despite
the
fact
i
had
this
on
a
hot
summer
night
it
still
felt
a
little
too
watered
down
one
and
done
for
me
overkill
at
its
purest
the
flaws
are
hard
to
overlook
what
works
works
really
well
but
as
i
drink
this
im
adjusting
ratings
lower
everything
works
well
but
the
taste
and
for
a
beverage
thats
a
big
flaw
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
coffee
stout
but
its
not
great
especially
when
you
compare
it
to
something
like
speedway
stout
pours
an
opaque
brown
colour
with
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
smells
of
very
mild
coffee
with
some
mild
roast
very
faint
smell
for
a
coffee
stout
though
flavour
has
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
and
roast
not
too
much
going
on
this
is
ok
but
ive
had
much
better
versions
of
this
style
d
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
but
its
not
something
that
i
particularly
enjoyed
i
love
a
good
coffee
stout
but
this
just
fell
short
o
i
have
had
better
i
think
it
has
potential
but
it
fell
well
short
of
my
personal
expectations
o
better
then
average
over
all
prospect
but
not
by
much
based
solely
on
nose
and
decent
flavor
appearance
and
mouthful
were
average
unlikely
repurchase
begins
to
tire
out
half
way
though
single
purchase
only
overall
it
is
what
is
advertised
a
very
coffee
forward
albeit
simple
american
stout
wouldnt
get
again
though
when
there
is
so
much
more
that
can
be
done
with
the
style
o
a
good
coffee
stout
but
not
as
bold
as
i
like
my
stouts
to
be
i
guess
for
a
6
beer
thats
to
be
expected
still
a
good
beer
o
overall
ok
maybe
i
just
dont
dig
coffee
stouts
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed

this

stand
out
in

one
more
than

flavors
were
smooth

not

with
slight
malt
and
a

of
coffee
that
intensifies
upon
swallowing
the
brew
is
light
with
good
carbonation
no
apparent
lacing
throughout
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
had
a
nice
flavor
as
well
as
i
dont
drink

finally
a
coffee
stout
that
tastes
like
flat
with
a
nice
light
brown
head
smell
is
of
roasted

smells
like
coffee
what
a

taste
is
a
lot
of
coffee

im
not

person
the

is

noticable

too
this

one
from
a

hopefully
they
arent

this
finishes
a

bitter
medium

with
some
carbonation
that
borders

much
not

all

a

watery
and

wouldnt
even
say
its
all
that
drinkable

a

black
with
about
a
half

tan
head
in
my
tulip
nose
is
mildly
tarlike
with
very
little
molasses
in
there
more
noticed
is
the
coffee
flavor
is
a
sustained
bitter
thing
with
definite
coffee
presence
and
a
light
grain
aroma
not
exactly
big
on
the
coffee
and
it
leaves
some
very
nice
brussels
lace
about
the
glass
as
it
goes
the
aroma
is
more
of
stout
than
starbucks
its
fairly
well
balanced
between
malt
and
coffee
but
nothing
that
could
compare
to
other
offerings

had

would

doesnt

up
this

especially
after
the
inviting
aromas
im
not
sure
if
the
tartness
is
a
result
of
roasting
the
malts
and
the
tangy
acidity
that
follows
or
something
else
more
roasted
malt
while
a
bit
bizarre
but
its
still
tasty
the
flavor

the

do
take
away
a
deep

the
aroma
tends
to
the
mild
with
just

maybe
a

the
taste
is
also
deep
roasted

it

again
the
burnt

come
out
i
had
a
taster
and
could
barley
finish
this
dont
think
im
up
for
a
full
pint
shorts
beers
tend
to
be
a
loveit
or
hateit
kind
of
thing
but
usually
im
in
the
former
camp
not
this
time
though
o
another
homerun
from
shorts
highly
recommended
oone
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
from
shorts
the
bitter
roasted
malts
and
coffee
are
well
balanced
by
the
lactose
sugars
really
creamy
almost
like
a
mochaccino
some
lingering
sweetness
and
coffee
flavors
just
a
really
delicious
beer
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
being
a
fan
of
coffee
but
would
have
had
it
a
little
higher
if
it
were
a
little
creamier
finally
a
shorts
beer
i
can
cozy
up
to
a
solid
ok
offering
from
this
brewery
which
is
a
first
for
me
pours
a
dark
caramel
brown
into
my
founders
snifter
with
a
dark
brown
head
that
quickly
fades
a
leaves
minimal
lacing
i
definitely
pick
up
the
coffee
flavor
maybe
a
bit
of
french
roast
a
slightly
bitter
coffee
taste
that
only
slightly
detracts
from
the
drinkability
a
solid
mouth
feel
but
not
chewy
enough
for
my
tastes
overall
a
solid
offering
from
shorts
its
about
time
for
a
brewery
that
gets
as
much
praise
as
they
do
a
little
more
than
your
average
coffee
beer
the
espresso
really
comes
through
in
the
nose
to
start
but
more
of
a
floral
bouquet
of
coffee
it
starts
off
creamy
and
coffee
and
remains
until
the
end
a
nice
acidity
from
the
coffee
is
present
as
well
super
solid
and
am
glad
i
was
able
to
snag
a
few
bottles
o
pretty
good
milk
stout
with
big
roasted
coffee
flavor
excellent
morning
beer
o
one
of
the
best
shorts
brews
ive
had
really
starting
to
come
around
on
them
lately
a
bit
of
a
one
note
beer
and
not
as
complex
as
fbs
but
still
wonderful
i
feel
really
lucky
to
be
able
to
get
two
great
coffee
stouts
so
fresh
when
the
coffee
flavor
is
at
its
peak
o
a
must
try
if
i
find
this
on
draft
i
just
might
sleep
on
the
floor
of
the
establishment
thats
serving
it
maybe
not
but
it
is
excellent
and
i
feel
like
this
beer
could
be
sessioned
maybe
paired
with
a
good
book
or
something
of
that
nature
cheesy
dont
care
just
drink
it
damn
you
o
never
really
found
cup
a
joe
to
be
a
balanced
beer
for
a
milk
stout
it
isnt
that
sweet
for
a
coffee
stout
its
rather
bland
every
year
i
keep
hoping
theyll
tweak
it
and
nail
it
i
was
blown
away
by
how
good
this
beer
was
hits
all
the
high
points
of
a
coffee
stout
the
coffee
isnt
overpowering
while
maintaining
a
bold
charred
character
well
done
living
in
michigan
definitely
has
its
perks
being
able
to
drink
shorts
on
tap
is
definitely
one
of
them
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
7
coffee
stouts
i
have
had
however
the
bottle
i
had
was
absolutely
putrid
it
was
not
old
but
had
clearly
refermented
into
an
undrinkable
mess
drinking
shorts
on
tap
is
the
only
way
to
go
pour
is
jet
black
with
virtually
no
head
nose
is
a
bit
artificial
artificial
vanilla
overly
sweet
malt
an
sugar
and
used
coffee
grounds
taste
is
just
as
bad
overly
sweet
under
attenuated
malt
and
coffee
mess
virtually
no
carb
and
extremely
oily
and
slick
feel
a
nice
coffee
stout
not
upper
rung
but
right
on
the
heels
of
them
the
beer
pours
motor
oil
black
with
a
razor
thin
tan
head
that
dissipates
there
is
very
little
lacing
or
head
retention
the
nose
emanates
a
potent
bitter
coffee
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
beer
drinks
like
a
cup
of
coffee
with
a
touch
of
milk
leaving
a
roasty
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
there
is
almost
no
distinctly
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
oily
sweet
and
roasty
it
definitely
a
coffee
cream
stout
with
a
great
body
and
a
sweet
effervescent
finish
worth
trying
and
it
definitely
lives
up
to
my
expectations
o
very
good
coffee
beer
pretty
straight
forward
coffee
beer
but
damn
good
fun
one
to
try
would
love
to
have
it
again
thanks
adam
o
really
nice
brew
coffee
is
quite
heavy
but
is
tasty
and
melds
well
with
the
cream
stout
characteristics
if
it
werent
so
coffee
dominant
id
give
it
even
better
ratings
definitely
a
musthave
for
the
coffee
lover
especially
if
you
take
yours
with
cream
o
shorts
certainly
has
a
skill
for
making
beers
which
meet
their
descriptions
while
this
beer
lacks
the
flavors
and
aromas
that
i
would
normally
associate
with
a
stout
this
is
spot
on
like
a
good
cup
of
coffee
with
some
cream
phenomenal
execution
ive
had
this
on
bottle
and
tap
certainly
better
on
tap
but
amazing
either
way
im
a
huge
fan
of
stouts
and
i
drink
coffee
like
crazy
so
naturally
i
have
an
affinity
to
coffeestouts
this
stout
is
better
than
most
people
give
it
credit
for
so
if
you
see
it
and
you
like
coffee
make
sure
you
give
it
a
shot
this
isnt
really
doing
it
for
me
comes
off
a
bit
too
bitter
and
somewhat
tangy
with
a
flavor
ride
that
doesnt
last
that
long
or
not
long
enough
imo
body
is
nice
still
an
okay
beer
especially
after
it
warms
up
a
bit
maybe
ive
had
too
many
coffee
beers
until
now
and
i
have
certain
expectations
taste
has
more
roasty
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
a
light
sourness
medium
light
body
but
perhaps
a
tad
on
the
watery
side
a
good
creamy
coffee
beer
but
there
are
some
imperfections
evident
o
shorts
is
spot
on
with
this
offering
what
a
beer
deep
brown
and
near
black
in
colour
ring
of
tan
head
little
to
no
lace
left
behind
smell
is
roasted
with
lots
of
coffee
a
bit
of
chocolate
lightly
lactic
as
well
and
a
little
metallic
light
alcohol
taste
is
creamy
with
lots
of
bitter
chocolate
and
black
coffee
and
coffee
grinds
roasty
and
a
bit
lactic
with
some
smoke
in
the
finish
as
well
mediumlight
carbonation
medium
body
decent
feel
taste
and
feels
much
better
than
the
way
it
smells
at
first
lots
of
coffee
in
here
not
the
best
coffee
beer
i
have
had
but
still
quite
good
thanks
namarsha82
o
this
is
pretty
average
overall
really
interesting
but
just
not
really
anything
special
overall
i
have
had
a
lot
of
coffee
stouts
and
also
milk
stouts
but
this
one
is
one
of
the
better
ones
to
those
with
low
reviews
it
must
have
been
a
bottle
not
refrigerated
and
to
those
in
michigan
i
still
can
not
believe
you
can
just
buy
this
off
the
shelf
damn
good
stout
this
is
so
close
to
being
a
superb
coffee
stout
though
some
slightly
offputting
aspects
of
the
flavor
and
aroma
hold
it
back
o
b
for
me
on
this
one
its
a
solid
coffee
stout
but
in
that
arena
i
dont
think
you
are
going
to
sway
me
from
fbs
or
wb
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
snifter
pours
opaque
and
oily
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
recedes
to
a
very
thin
collar
of
lace
the
nose
is
very
freshly
roasted
and
earthy
coffee
along
with
some
molasses
and
burnt
brown
sugar
and
light
nuttiness
the
flavor
is
more
acidic
than
the
nose
would
have
suggested
but
with
all
of
the
same
roasted
coffee
molasses
and
nutty
qualities
the
body
is
medium
with
light
carbonation
and
a
very
long
roasted
coffee
finish
d
just
a
touch
too
much
of
a
sweet
desert
type
beer
to
really
grab
the
next
higher
score
but
it
is
very
close
looks
nice
smells
great
tastes
good
and
it
is
a
tad
more
filling
but
oh
well
a
burly
robust
dark
sweet
desert
beer
very
nice
overall
this
is
a
really
coffee
forward
brew
that
has
a
great
nose
and
taste
but
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
bit
thicker
for
sure
midnight
black
and
pours
like
motor
oil
nice
tancocoa
head
on
top
great
espresso
aromareally
stands
out
in
a
big
way
heavy
roasted
malts
up
front
with
a
very
strong
coffee
flavor
long
lingering
coffee
taste
with
a
decent
sweetness
as
well
nice
mouthfeela
bit
prickly
on
the
tongue
really
a
nice
coffee
beer
all
in
overall
i
have
heard
of
this
one
for
quite
a
while
so
when
it
showed
up
as
an
extra
i
was
really
excited
to
try
it
imo
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
but
if
you
get
the
chance
to
pick
one
up
at
a
reasonable
price
its
worth
the
time
thanks
to
mcnuts
for
the
extra
this
was
an
ok
beer
for
me
there
isnt
much
depth
to
the
flavors
or
aromas
they
seem
as
if
they
could
be
a
bit
bolder
and
fuller
definitely
not
up
with
the
best
of
the
coffee
stouts
but
overall
its
a
decent
one
creamy
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
lactic
acid
a
nice
coffee
cream
stout
but
probably
not
one
that
i
would
attempt
to
cellar
i
could
see
the
lactic
notes
taking
over
o
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
shorts
so
far
this
beer
is
a
little
past
its
prime
but
fresh
it
is
awesome
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
sourness
of
it
sticks
to
me
like
a
sore
thumb
the
nose
promises
wonderful
robust
coffee
and
then
the
flavor
delivers
an
odd
sour
finish
that
contrasts
sharply
with
the
other
characters
of
the
beer
o
this
has
good
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
really
nice
and
interesting
stout
you
really
get
what
the
name
says
in
this
one
there
is
a
ton
of
coffee
presence
as
well
as
some
cream
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
i
recommend
trying
it
unless
you
dislike
coffee
flavor
in
your
stouts
in
the
world
of
coffee
stouts
this
is
a
really
nice
one
its
smooth
and
creamy
and
the
transitions
are
well
done
to
the
point
where
this
is
a
beer
latte
more
than
just
coffee
flavored
beer
the
milk
sugar
is
done
excellently
it
does
more
to
diversify
and
enhance
the
flavor
profile
rather
than
to
just
provide
sweetness
again
this
one
wins
as
being
much
more
than
tasting
like
just
a
stout
with
coffee
drink
this
was
one
of
the
better
coffee
stouts
that
i
have
had
nice
depth
of
flavor
and
good
profile
really
packed
a
coffee
punch
behind
it
very
enjoyable
appearance
is
black
opaque
and
a
slight
tan
head
that
lines
the
glass
smells
of
strong
coffee
and
chocolate
its
very
roasty
and
robust
it
has
a
stronger
coffee
flavor
and
smell
than
the
java
stout
which
i
was
surprised
by
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
smooth
nicely
carbonated
after
trying
fbs
java
and
now
cup
a
joe
i
like
fbs
first
cup
a
joe
second
and
java
stout
third
theyre
all
great
beers
update
2012
this
years
release
doesnt
seem
as
heavy
on
the
milk
sugar
and
cream
flavor
its
just
about
as
good
but
i
think
i
like
the
2011
release
slightly
more
the
score
stays
the
same
overall
this
one
is
alright
i
guess
but
for
a
coffee
stout
it
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
expectations
its
definitely
got
the
cream
and
lactose
areas
covered
but
for
a
coffee
stout
i
expected
to
taste
a
bit
more
of
that
element
throughout
the
beer
worth
checking
out
but
like
may
shorts
beers
not
worth
going
crazy
for
give
it
a
go
if
you
can
easily
find
it
o
this
was
good
something
in
the
latter
half
of
the
drink
that
is
offputting
cant
get
over
the
creamy
sweetness
there
hmm
overall
if
youre
a
coffee
drinker
this
is
a
must
have
flavors
come
out
perfect
without
a
harsh
after
taste
overall
if
you
like
strong
coffee
you
must
seek
this
beer
im
a
huge
milk
stout
fan
so
this
beer
is
right
up
my
ally
ive
had
many
coffee
beers
before
but
this
one
is
unlike
all
others
ive
had
this
is
a
coffee
bomb
fantastic
beer
and
cant
wait
for
my
next
one
thanks
shorts
o
this
one
certainly
doesnt
disappoint
bold
coffee
stout
that
is
both
tasty
and
very
drinkable
i
know
its
brand
spanking
new
but
the
guys
at
shorts
should
seriously
start
thinking
about
putting
dates
on
the
bottles
just
saying
oas
delicious
and
aromatic
as
this
is
i
can
only
drink
a
few
a
season
i
do
enjoy
fbs
more
and
can
session
that
i
can
but
this
is
one
intense
coffee
stout
tasty
but
not
an
everyday
beer
please
sir
may
i
have
some
more
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
fantastic
i
have
two
more
bottles
one
of
which
i
will
have
around
the
holidays
and
the
other
i
think
i
will
save
for
the
end
of
the
world
12

that
is
o
overall
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
one
the
burnt
coffee
flavor
is
pretty
off
putting
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
impressive
either
glad
i
got
to
try
it
either
way
3
5
o
underwhelming
brew
for
sure
i
expected
a
lot
more
out
of
this
one
but
for
a
coffee
stout
its
nice
overall
if
nothing
else
mattered
i
would
have
a
stockpile
of
this
beer
and
start
every
day
with
one
or
two
lovely
stuff
here
overall
this
really
missed
its
mark
it
really
tastes
like
the
brew
is
infected
the
aroma
and
the
taste
are
totally
different
i
like
the
coffee
aromas
but
the
sour
taste
and
mouthfeel
really
ruins
this
beer
o
this
is
pretty
damn
awful
raisin
and
bitter
coffee
is
not
what
you
wanna
wake
up
too
or
say
goodnite
with
i
feel
like
putting
a
drop
or
two
of
coffee
creamer
in
it
just
to
make
it
drinkable
thanks
to
pocwolf
for
sending
this
as
an
extra
definitely
a
delicious
treat
and
very
drinkable
o
i
used
to
think
that
most
of
shorts
brews
were
infected
and
i
guess
most
are
however
they
did
a
brewery
takeover
at
churchkey
here
in
dc
last
month
i
sampled
tons
of
their
brews
and
im
now
think
that
the
sourness
is
just
part
of
their
taste
profile
what
do
you
think
overall
i
am
very
impressed
by
this
one
this
is
a
nice
sweet
milky
sugary
stout
that
is
not
overly
bitter
on
the
coffee
but
on
the
contrary
it
was
like
i
went
to
mcdonalds
and
bought
an
iced
coffee
it
was
just
so
well
balanced
and
perfect
on
the
palate
the
smells
are
not
overly
complex
but
this
one
really
shines
through
in
the
tastes
a
great
beer
that
was
picked
up
at
a
great
price
and
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
again
once
i
run
out
congrats
shorts
this
one
is
definitely
a
winner
in
my
books
o
very
surprising
not
the
biggest
coffee
fan
but
this
was
tasty
very
roasty
love
the
strong
coffee
taste
not
bad
but
ill
admit
that
i
take
my
coffee
black
milk
stouts
have
never
been
my
thing
but
this
is
certainly
ranking
above
most
of
them
some
coffee
lovers
might
like
it
but
in
my
opinion
if
i
want
pure
and
simple
coffee
i
would
have
well
coffee

m
light
to
medium
body
light
carbonation
note
i
noticed
this
one
was
turning
for
the
worse
back
in
february
so
not
surprising
to
see
the
recent
bad
reviews
guess
anything
with
lactose
should
be
consumed
fresh
overall
very
well
done
by
shorts
o
this
beer
is
well
made
and
fits
the
style
it
just
didnt
offer
me
anything
i
loved
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
if
it
was
around
me
i
would
probably
pick
it
up
from
time
to
time
hopefully
this
was
an
anomaly
o
i
was
really
disappointed
seeing
this
beer
made
me
excited
to
try
it
and
it
was
so
disappointing
when
i
had
to
drain
pour
it
im
wondering
why
it
still
has
an
a
average
the
look
and
viscosity
were
good
the
whole
coffee
aspect
of
this
was
bad
thoughi
am
a
coffee
geek
can
i
assume
they
added
the
coffee
during
the
boil
for
extraction
i
dont
know
but
thats
what
it
tastes
like
and
it
turned
out
bad
pours
a
motor
oil
black
with
the
faintest
whisper
of
a
foam
head
appears
to
be
a
very
low
level
of
carbonation
nose
has
freshly
brewed
drip
coffee
cinnamon
sugar
doughnuts
as
well
as
spent
coffee
grinds
and
sweet
non
dairy
creamer
really
a
nicely
put
together
aroma
taste
is
almost
sourbitter
coffee
really
unpleasant
compared
to
how
nice
the
nose
was
sour
red
fruits
as
well
but
the
low
level
of
carbonation
really
hurts
the
taste
and
drinkability
no
bottled
on
date
prevents
me
from
knowing
how
old
this
is
infection
seems
likely
but
an
unusual
amount
of
powdered
lactose
also
seems
like
a
culprit
overall
certainly
tasty
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
since
its
so
thin
the
lactose
and
intensity
of
the
coffee
are
a
turnoff
though
serving
type
bottle
o
this
one
smelled
great
and
for
a
second
tasted
really
good
i
bet
if
i
had
this
fresh
it
would
be
one
hellofa
beer
too
bad
this
one
wasnt
good
d
probably
wont
even
finish
the
sucker
ok
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
straight
black
olive
i
love
black
olives
but
damn
not
in
beer
there
is
a
strong
salty
midpalate
flavor
that
is
throwing
the
whole
flavor
profile
off
that
mixed
with
a
strong
espresso
backend
brought
me
back
to
the
day
of
eating
black
olives
from
the
can
nothing
like
putting
the
pitted
black
olives
on
your
fingers
so
you
have
olive
fingers
and
then
eating
them
off
hey
dont
judge
me
i
know
you
did
it
too
overall
this
is
an
interested
black
olive
beer
decent
beer
that
i
would
have
again
but
not
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
terrible
beer
that
i

of

a
smooth

mouthfeel
with
a
dry
coffee

a
small
sweetness
in

like
drinking
a

cup
of
coffee
a

sweeter
than
i
prefer
in

coffee

for
the
beer
it
works

the

as

i
was
looking
forward
to
the
bottle
i
picked
up
at

ten

store
in
okemos
mi
damnitall
this
was
a
letdown
the
funky
whiff
of
scorched
coffee
resin
emanating
from
the
bottle
was
a
warning
shot
it
was
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
had
some
good
stouty
qualities
but
my
taste
buds
were
battered
by
overwhelming
burnt
coffee
leftmycoffeemakeronallday

any
other
subleties
in

were
blown
away
by

also
dark

and
a
roasted
note
of
a
can
of
coffee
beans
taste
is
very
bold
and
sweet
heavy
of
the
coffee

a
toasted

taste
that
remains
bitter
and
a
sweet
hint
of
milky
sugar
in
the
finish
which
ends
creamy
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
little
underwhealming
for

for
me
this
is
an
overdone
coffeecream
stout

i
suppose
thats
why
its
imperial
if
you
like
bold
coffee
notes
this
is
certainly
worth
checking

stick
with
the

to

doing

that

i
really
like
this

the

does

to
deviate
from
this
plan
of
attack
some
buttercream
finds
its
way
in
there
as
well
in
the
finish
i
do
believe
that
behind
the
roast
is
some
vanilla
notes
the
taste
obviously
is
strong
of
coffee
there
is
a
background
flavor
that
is
sugary
and
sweet
i
must
admit
the
almost
too
sweet
aftertaste
is
rather
off
putting
when
combined
with
the
rest
of
this
beers
flavor
it
leaves
that
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
that
happens
after

roasted

bitterness
with
the
creme
coming

in

what
i
make

id
rather
choke
down
a

than
this

and
it
tends
to
dominate

profile
too
much
im
going

give
a

some

5thank
you
chocolaty
but
a
bit
chalky
too
malt
forward
but
not
my
favorite
a
bit
bitter
sweet
dark
chocolate
aroma
black
body
with
a
light
brown
head
that
quickly
thins
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
taste
that
i
cant
identify
roasted
malt
is
more
present
than
the
chocolate
in
the
taste
mildly
bitter
a
stout
as
a
session
beer
thats
nearly
what
this
was
as
it
felt
weak
and
i
couldnt
taste
or
detect
the
alcohol
when
i
finally
made
my
way
through
this
some
dark
fruits
booze
and
maybe
another
chocolate
malt
would
have
taken
this
up
another
level
and
with
offerings
like
the
brooklyn
black
chocolate
stout
still
on
the
shelf
why
reach
for
this
its
only
a
go
if
you
plan
on
downing
a
few
at
a
time
to
go
with
your
dessert
of
the
moment
worst
chocolate
stout
ive
ever
had
first
sip
is
a
rush
of
fake
chocolate
sweetness
with
a
thin
body
this
is
not
a
nice
malty
sweet
flavor
rather
more
like
starbucks
coffee
syrup
i
really
dislike
this
beer
and
this
is
the
third
time
ive
tried
it
before
reviewing
it
not
too
sweet
not
too
bitter
for
a
stout
it
has
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
dark
chocolate
color
with
little
to
no
head
nose
is
heavy
in
chocolate
cocoa
like
taste
pretty
much
follows
suit
it
does
meet
the
requirements
for
the
style
but
personally
i
cant
drink
more
than
one
of
these
somebody
left
a
six
pack
of
this
at
my
house
its
not
a
beer
i
would
ever
seek
out
and
buy
i
personally
dont
understand
why
somebody
would
want
their
beer
to
taste
like
chocolate
thats
why
theres
cocoa
i
could
see
it
if
there
was
a
hint
of
chocolate
but
this
one
is
way
over
the
top
with
the
chocolate
it
is
what
it
purports
to
be
and
meets
the
style
guidelines
but
i
really
dont
like
it
and
find
it
somewhat
of
a
chore
to
drink
i
was
surprised
at
how
good
of
a
job
harpoon
did
with
this
chocolate
stout
hate
to
say
but
i
expected
mediocrity
and
at
1
49
a
bottle
from
total
wine
how
would
you
not
pours
thick
dark
brown
to
black
med
to
heavy
body
coating
the
mouth
with
each
sip
nice
chocolate
taste
not
too
overwhelming
my
only
issue
is
an
odd
lingering
aftertaste
well
done
though
harpoon
all
in
all
this
beer
is
pretty
much
what
it
sets
out
to
be
and
is
a
really
great
dessert
beer
i
drink
a
lot
of
beer
this
is
my
very
favorite
chocolate
stout
this
sentence
exists
because
i
have
to
rationalize
my
opinion
it
was
a
very
good
beer
i
had
it
as
part
of
a
mixer
sixer
and
want
to
try
it
again
not
much
chocolate
flavor
poor
mouthfeel
extremely
dark
color
nice
lace
from
smaller
head
rich
cocoa
flavor
tapering
off
to
a
malt
finish
good
find
since
its
a
limited
time
brew
great
chocolate
full
body
flavor
edit
after
reading
other
reviews
i
will
agree
with
those
who
would
say
this
beer
tastes
better
the
warmer
it
gets
o
i
wanted
to
ding
this
as
a
light
weight
when
i
drank
it
cold
but
letting
it
warm
made
it
very
enjoyable
and
original
a
neat
mix
of
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
caramel
coffee
with
a
dry
roast
stout
base
i
like
this
more
than
most
it
has
a
very
pronounced
sweet
chocolate
taste
nice
desert
beer
overall
a
disappointment
overall

my
first
chocolate
stout
and
as
a
chocolate
lover
i
think
i
have
found
something
i
am
going
to
investigate
more
overall
a
decent
chocolate
brew
that
was
surprisingly
dry
in
light
of
its
aroma
nothing
too
exceptional
but
a
nice
try
and
a
decent
choice
in
light
of
its
price
for
a
darker
and
more
drinkable
chocolate
stout
overall
decent
chocolate
stout
theres
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
coffee
stouts
out
there
and
this
one
doesnt
distinguish
itself
as
a
mustdrink
but
its
a
solid
dessert
beer
option
taste
is
appropriately
chocolate
above
all
else
i
get
the
milk
chocolate
goodness
all
over
with
a
brief
finish
of
bittersweet
completing
the
journey
this
one
definitely
delivers
what
it
promises
and
is
as
superb
a
chocolate
stout
as
ive
ever
had
overall
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
but
definitely
not
the
best
chocolate
stout
out
there
still
impressed
with
the
smoothness
and
drink
ability
i
also
had
a
stout
heart
of
darkness
from
magic
hat
brewing
company
in
the
same
session
and
i
enjoyed
the
harpoon
more
medium
bodied
a
little
too
light

taste

average
but
certainly
nothing
special
if
you
like
hershey
syrup
in
1
milk
or
yoohoo
this
is
the
alcoholic
version
of
that
take
it
or
leave
it
but
its
taste
enough
to
be
above
average
o
stouts
arent
usually
my
thing
but
this
is
a
good
midlevel
offering
it
certainly
lives
up
to
its
name
not
grossly
sweet
like
some
stouts
and
the
flavor
is
actually
pretty
decent
for
what
it
is
id
recommend
it
dark
dark
dark
with
an
eggshell
foam
on
top
this
beer
will
make
the
whole
room
smell
like
a
chocolate
factory
it
definitely
tastes
like
chocolate
dark
unsweetened
80
cacao
chocolate
smooth
on
the
tongue
an
absolute
delight
hadnt
seen
it
around
in
a
year
or
two
glad
to
see
it
back
i
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
night
but
will
keep
a
few
in
the
fridge
to
keep
those
upcoming
wintertime
blues
away
overall
harpoon
is
from
my
home
city
so
i
try
to
forget
my
bias
but
this
is
a
great
version
of
a
chocolate
or
american
stout
they
got
it
right
mostly
i
really
like
this
stout
the
chocolate
smell
is
one
of
the
most
pronounced
of
any
beer
claiming
chocolate
in
the
title
the
drink
greets
with
chocolate
near
the
front
of
the
tongue
but
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
there
is
the
roasted
coffee
beans
aspect
it
turns
bitter
as
it
goes
down
i
will
get
this
again
next
christmas
o
pass
on
this
one
o
simplistic
stout
yet
very
drinkable
pretty
one
dimensional
but
makes
a
good
dessert
beer
that
isnt
too
heavy
reminds
me
of
a
poor
mans
sam
smith
chocolate
stout
notes
decent
tasty
easy
drinking
great
aroma
this
beer
would
benefit
from
a
bigger
mouthfeel
o
overall
this
beer
achieves
its
goal
its
a
light
stout
with
a
very
chocolate
forward
profile
no
booze
to
make
it
appealing
to
more
than
beer
connoisseurs
and
its
perfect
as
a
dessert
substitute
people
have
been
too
harsh
on
this
ratings
would
be
higher
if
people
just
considered
what
it
set
out
to
do
but
what
can
you
expect
of
people
tasteherbal
hop
note
cocoa
powder
dry
finish
flavors
are
not
quite
in
harmony
as
they
seem
to
exist
seperately
without
complementing
each
other
interesting
but
unbalanced
overall
less
is
more

an

wish
this
wasnt

available
in

12

with
only
2
bottles
per
pack
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
all
in
all
an
interesting
and
impressive
brew
probably
the
most
chocolaty
brew
ive
tried
short
of
pouring
chocolate
syrup
into
a
stout
almost
an
overload
on
the
chocolate
but
this
one
pulls
it
off
mouthfeel
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
but
all
in
all
im
impressed
if
you
like
chocolate
this
is
a
must
try
not
really
sessionable
but
if
i
ever
have
the
opportunity
to
get
a
few
more
bottles
thered
be
no
hesitation
drinkability
the
beer
is
not
very
heavy
at
all
but
not
yet
a
light
beer
really
had
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
have
had
other
chocolate
stouts
that
are
way
better
rogue

brooklyn
for
example
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
a
date
marked

the
dark
baked
chocolate
aroma
penetrates
the
nose
as
soon
as
i
pry
the
bottle
cap
off
it
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
tone
with
a
lingering
tan
head
the
taste
is
very
chocolately
with
a
little
hops
in
the
background
it
is
a
bit
overwhelming
but
it
really
isnt
too
bad
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
buy
regularly

i
really
like
the
cocoa
powder
chocolate
character
of
this
beer
it
is
a
bit
lighter
bodied
than
the
typical
winter
stout
less
coffee
tasting
as
well
the
milk
shake
ovaltine
description
is
fitting
overall
id
have
liked
it
to
be
more
full
bodied
and
perhaps
higher
alcohol
like
an
imperial
stout
still
though
this
is
pretty
decent
stuff
just
keep
in
mind
its
only

had
in
their
winter
sample
pack
the
appearance
is
jet
black
with
a
browncolored
lacing
on
the
sides
really
thin
head
though
aromas
are
really
rich
in
a
smoked
mocha
chocolate
flavor
noticed
a
hint
of
toffee
but
much
more
of
a
dark
chocolate
taste
is
really
great
representative
of
the
aromas
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
flavor
mouthfeel
helps
with
a
light
carbonation
to
an
otherwise
creamy
drink
that
is
also
pretty
light
comparatively
overall
a
fantastic
chocolate
stout
overall
a
highly
confusing
experience
this
beer
is
decent
but
ultimately
sells
the
whole
chocolate
thing
too
eagerly
it
should
be
the
sideshow
not
the
main
event
at
the
end
of
the
day
stout
is
the
ringleader

doh
had
such
high
hopes
for
this
offering
from
harpoon
pours
a
dark
brown
as
youd
expect
in
a
chocolate
and
the
aroma
is
pure
chocolate
like
smelling
a
vat
of
melted
hersheys
unbelieveable
aroma
really
hoped
that
the
taste
would
match
but
no
falls
very
flat
slight
chocolate
taste
very
light
cocoa
notes
but
if
it
werent
for
the
nose
i
wouldnt
be
sure
this
is
a
chocolate
maybe
harpoon
will
refine
the
taste
as
it
evolves
if
they
keep
it
as
an
option
cause
not
there
yet
southern
tier
choklat
and
rogue
choc
stout
still
the
best
two
chocolates
by
far
my
first
real
experience
with
a
beer
that
was
chocolate
flavored
i
was
quite
happy
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
carbonated
and
makes
it
tough
to
drink
although
not
a
bad
beer
i
wont
search
it
out
again
keep
the
brain
trust
working
on
making

anyone
not

you
only
get
2
out

pour

the
taste

zinc
lozenge

shining

held
to

light
great
frothy
light
brown
head
that
retains
forever
smells
like
hersheys
syrup
so
far
so
good
then
tasting
the
beer
it
goes
downhill
theres
a
certain
offtaste
right
up

that
sticks
to
the
palate
sort
of
tinny
along
with
chocolate
syrup
and
a
weird
cherrylike
flavor
semi
dry
finish
light
carbonation
pretty
thin
its
okay
at
best
great
looking
beer
smells
pretty
promising
then
let
down
by
the
actual
substance
of
the
brew
the
flavor
close
but
no
cigar
the
chocolate
in
this
beer
tastes
very
artificial
and
does
not
meld
well
with
the
malt
bottle
says
there
is
chocolate
flavor
added
whatever
the
hell
that
means
i
think
the
metallic
taste
is
from
the
chocolate
flavoring
not
very
sweet
for
a
chocolate
stout
overall
i
wouldnt
recommend
it

market
basket
pours
an
almost
opaque
black
with
few
rubyred
highlights
and
a
quarter
inch
of
light
tan
head
smells
strongly
of
chocolate
malt
not
chocolate
reminiscent
of
espresso
beans
espressso
beans
dominate
the
flavor
as
well
with
a
malty
sweetness
flavor
actually
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
less
alcoholic
kahlua
very
similar
to
kahlua
which
doesnt
bother
me
since
i
really
like
kahlua
medium
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
in
the
world
though
it
wasnt
much
work
to
finish
the
glass
a
unique
interesting
beer
unlike
any
ive
had
perhaps
a
more
fitting
name
would
be
coffee
stout
rather
than
a
chocolate
stout
though
i
understand
the
name
glad
i
tried
it
definitely
worth
a
try
i
may
try
cooking
with
this
one
too
i
think
it
may
add
a
unique
pleasant
character
to
a
chocolate
pudding
or
brownies
see
saunders
best
of
american
beer
and
food
to
see
what
i
mean
not
a
bad
beer
overall
overall
im
glad
theres
only
two
of
these
in
the
mix
pack
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
that
the
flavors
were
too
quirky
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
very
excited
to
notice
this
chocolate
stout
in
the
harpoon
christmas
12pack
grabbed
it
right
away
off
the
shelf
at
the
everbetter
johnnys
foodmaster
next
door
sadly
though
even
as
i
poured
this
the
anticipation
waned
as
what
came
out
looked
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
proper
the
chocolate
aroma
was
quite
nice
the
head
very
lacking
and
the
taste
was
a
bit
medicinal
i
went
back
to
my
pal
munich
dark
thereafter
a
bit
disappointed
huge
chocolate
flavor
all
around
it
reminds
me
of
the
ommegang
chocolate
indulgence
but
the
oci
was
more
dry
this
stuff
is
a
purersmooth
chocolate
taste
would
love
to
buy
yearround
in
fact
i
already
emailed
harpoon
asking
if
it
was
available
in
kegs
i
know
its
not
but
hopefully
they
get
the
message
i
was
very
dissapointed
in
this
brew
it
comes
in
a
rather
exciting
twelve
pack
but
alas
it
was
my
least
favorite
d
it
was
a
bit
thin
and
one
dimensional
making
it
a
fair
but
unimpressive
brew
its
light
enough
to
drink
several
but
why
would
you
when
there
are
so
many
other
better
brews
in
this
style
the
carbonation
makes
it
feel
like
a
soft
drink
the
chocolate
flavor
seems
a
bit
unnatural
and
there
isnt
enough
substance
beyond
that
wont
buy
again
not
a
bad
attempt
at
a
chocolate
stout
i
have
heard
that
this
is
a
very
limited
brew
and
i
can
kind
of
see
why
that
is
it
seems
rather
thin
on
mouthfeel
and
it
did
get
off
to
a
good
start
with
the
aroma
taste
is
in
the
middle
due
to
the
carbonation
its
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
buying
an
entire
12
pack
just
to
get
it
unless
you
happen
to
like
harpoons
other
brews
as
well
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
nice
full
creamy
head
developed
which
lasted
and
had
tremendous
lacing
which
lasted
through
the
beer
appearance
was
dark
deep
brown
aroma
was
caramel
with
a
malty
background
and
taste
was
malty
with
hints
of
vanilla
almost
reminded
me
of
a
cream
soda
mouthfeel
was
more
soda
like
nothing
like
you
would
expect
from
a
stout
and
aftertaste
was
dry
and
sweet
saranac
vanilla
stout
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
and
is
capped
by
a
frothy
oneinch
beige
colored
head
aromas
of
oak
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
make
quick
appearances
before
the
vanilla
dominates
the
nose
the
vanilla
flavors
again
dominate
the
pallet
but
in
a
good
way
flavors
of
roasted
malt
milk
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
coffee
can
be
found
under
the
vanilla
interesting
and
slightly
sweet
vanilla
stout
is
medium
in
body
and
moderatelight
in
carbonation
o
if
you
like
dark
beers
with
a
good
bit
of
vanilla
this
ones
for
you
the
body
is
medium
to
thin
medium
carbonation
feels
a
little
too
much
like
a
soda
not
an
awful
beer
but
not
one
that
id
recommend
the
problem
with
saranac
is
that
most
of
their
beers
are
just
okay
like
they
decided
to
cut
corners
somewhere
this
one
doesnt
really
fit
that
mold
but
it
still
leaves
something
to
be
desired
a
little
more
abv
might
help
this
one
taste
starts
with
dark
maltiness
cold
stale
coffee
and
tart
artificiality
in
the
middle
and
an
acrid
bitter
close
with
wisps
of
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
alright
and
drinkability
is
average
at
best
the
clunker
in
the
mix
pack
for
me
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
looking
blackish
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
pretty
big
nose
of
vanilla
with
the
dark
roasted
malts
in
the
background
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
little
on
the
muted
side
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
vanilla
in
there
but
it
tasted
a
little
bit
artificial
to
me
the
roasted
malts
werent
too
bad
and
they
helps
balance
the
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
anything
too
crazy
it
was
rather
generic
if
you
ask
me
overall
the
nose
of
this
beer
is
a
really
nice
the
rest
of
it
kind
of
leave
the
drinker
hanging
and
waiting
for
more
this
is
a
nice
vanilla
stout
ive
had
others
that
seemed
artificially
flavored
but
this
one
seemed
to
offer
up
a
very
genuine
palate
poured
from
12oz
into
ommegang
tulip
pours
a
deep
black
with
off
white
foamy
head
nice
vanilla
and
roasted
malt
aromas
but
as
always
that
same
saranac
alt
aroma
where
you
know
its
a
saranac
nice
roasty
malt
and
subtle
vanilla
make
this
an
easy
tasty
stout
its
a
bit
heavy
to
be
a
session
brew
but
its
ease
of
drink
make
it
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
just
no
wow
factor
here
the
body
is
pretty
heavy
and
even
rtich
allowing
a
creamy
smoothness
to
flow
but
its
a
bit
too
heavily
carbonated
o
this
beer
wasnt
bad
but
could
have
been
a
little
better
for
a
stout
a
little
bit
lighter
then
your
average
stout
i
would
maybe
consider
sessioning
this
beer
would
have
liked
a
little
bit
more
pronounced
flavor
and
a
little
bit
less
carbonation
d
im
actually
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
its
a
simple
well
executed
stout
that
id
drink
again
no
award
winner
but
one
of
decent
quality
and
easy
drinking
o
vanilla
stouts
can
either
be
awesome
or
a
dud
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
was
definitely
missing
oomph
you
can
taste
the
effort
but
its
definitely
lacking
very
drinkable
but
thats
because
its
sort
of
bland
i
dont
think
i
would
rush
out
and
get
more
only
because
there
are
better
american
stouts
out
there
pours
deep
brown
with
reddish
highlights
and
a
creamy
beige
head
curtains
of
lace
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
of
vanilla
and
dark
roast
coffee
very
biting
aftertaste
on
back
of
the
tounge
could
have
been
sweeter
and
the
vanilla
be
more
pronounced
due
to
the
overall
average
flavor
this
beer
does
not
have
a
strong
drinkability
though
you
could
put
multiples
of
these
down
i
am
not
sure
why
you
would
want
to
decent
enough
on
tap
amongst
the
average
swill
thatnis
usually
on
tap
in
bars
in
my
area
but
not
a
world
beater
by
an
means
overall
intersting
brew
but
the
strength
of
the
vanilla
might
be
a
bit
much
for
my
taste
though
this
would
go
well
with
some
ice
cream
this
is
an
alright
beer
but
needs
a
little
more
balance
the
vanilla
is
too
intense
and
the
roasted
malts
offer
little
balance
the
sweetness
takes
away
from
the
overall
drinkability
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
12
inch
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
and
dots
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
bread
and
vanilla
taste
is
of
toastedroasted
malt
cocoa
powder
and
vanilla
beans
there
is
a
slightly
bitter
and
acidic
roast
flavor
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
not
very
good
in
this
regard
this
beer
has
a
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
stout
that
suffers
from
the
acidic
aspect
and
too
much
carbonation
overall
not
that
great
a
version
of
the
genre
but
its
not
offensive
either
i
consider
this
better
than
breckenridge
because
the
flavor
profile
is
more
subtle
i
had
very
high
hopes
for
this
beer
vanilla
stout
i
was
psyched
i
bought
a
cold
12
pack
of
the
12
beers
of
christmas
and
there
were
2
of
these
vanilla
stouts
included
i
raced
home
made
a
great
meal
and
poured
a
frosty
mug
full
and
what
a
flop
it
was
pretty
much
a
bland
stout
overall
not
even
a
hint
of
vanilla
this
fell
short
and
flat
of
my
expectations
even
for
a
plain
stout
rather
bitter
and
blah
save
your
money
for
a
real
craft
brew
amen
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
very
dark
but
not
opaque
the
beer
pored
a
big
tan
head
the
beer
had
a
hint
of
vanilla
on
the
nose
that
was
just
right
taste
was
balanced
well
vanilla
not
being
too
prominent
i
liked
the
beer
and
will
buy
again
overall
a
nice
beer
for
the
cold
winter
months
o
on
the
nose
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
breckenridge
vanilla
porter
not
as
good
as
that
beer
but
a
nice
facsimile
this
is
the
second
saranac
beer
ive
tried
from
their
winter
pack
its
got
a
really
nice
vanilla
nose
and
taste
very
strong
vanilla
almost
like
straight
extract
it
is
quite
a
bit
better
as
it
warms
though
there
is
a
little
too
much
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
which
kind
of
mutes
the
vanilla
a
little
bit
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
pours
an
almost
black
body
with
dark
brown
edges
topped
by
a
sticky
tan
head
with
good
retention
aromas
are
very
literal
on
the
vanilla
smelling
like
a
bottle
of
extract
waved
right
under
the
nose
with
just
a
hint
of
something
roasty
taste
is
considerably
roastier
and
closer
to
approximating
the
typical
stout
profile
with
a
considerably
strong
vanilla
character
throughout
and
lot
of
toffee
notes
on
the
finish
the
body
is
disappointingly
thin
but
this
is
a
not
a
bad
beer
overall
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
garnet
highlights
when
held
to
light
fluffy
almost
tan
head
displays
moderate
retention
and
leave
lots
of
sticky
lace
in
its
wake
slightly
roasty
with
caramel
and
dark
sugar
in
the
aroma
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
butterscotch
with
little
to
no
hop
presence
taste
is
heavy
on
the
vanilla
but
light
on
the
stout
theres
lots
of
caramel
and
butterscotch
but
only
a
hint
of
roast
little
to
no
hop
flavor
medium
body
and
carbonation
with
a
sweet
creamy
mouthfeel
it
looks
like
i
saved
the
worst
for
last
too
much
vanilla
too
sweet
not
enough
roast
diacytl
one
and
done
for
this
guy
o
good
example
of
the
flavored
stout
style
it
definitely
doesnt
lack
in
taste
it
might
be
a
bit
watery
but
the
flavors
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
dominate
enough
to
let
you
know
this
is
a
stout
of
some
sort
i
love
vanilla
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
work
in
this
beer
too
cloying
and
seems
artificial
like
it
not
so
much
o
a
really
solid
stout
good
for
the
winter
as
the
label
portrays
more
vanilla
would
be
nice
still
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
i
have
to
be
honest
this
beer
surprised
me
a
lot
i
normally
dont
really
reach
for
any
saranac
beers
and
had
i
seen
this
one
the
shelf
i
would
have
probably
passed
too
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
stout
its
flavorful
and
once
again
very
easy
to
drink
personally
i
would
have
preferred
more
vanilla
flavor
than
there
is
but
this
borders
on
the
safer
side
without
being
overtly
sweet
or
sickening
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
stout
and
a
great
effort
great
roastyness
and
good
balance
between
roastyness
and
vanilla
its
a
stout
and
its
good
they
didnt
go
overboard
with
vanilla
because
a
stout
is
not
supposed
to
taste
sweet
like
a
cappacino
this
still
tastes
like
a
good
old
dark
roasty
beer
my
reveiw
may
be
bias
because
this
beer
was
free
and
therefore
probably
tastes
better
this
beer
comes
in
a
variety
case
thats
pretty
cheap
and
full
of
decent
brews
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
stout
with
an
interesting
transition
and
character
to
explore
subsequently
tried
it
with
some
jalapeno
smokehouse
almonds
and
it
stood
up
well
to
the
task
mouthfeel
is
rich
enough
for
the
style
drinkability
oops
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
and
light
enough
to
be
called
a
session
beer
a
bit
more
vanilla
and
the
drinkability
would
be
affected
negatively
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
well
but
i
cant
say
that
this
experience
was
all
that
enjoyable
or
easy
drinking
i
probably
wouldnt
have
this
again
if
i
was
given
a
choice
but
it
was
worthy
trying
it
once
just
to
say
i
did
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
to
me
d
well
i
just
reviewed
lake
effect
lager
and
thought
it
was
the
best
saranac
beer
i
had
up
to
this
point
this
one
edges
it
out
slightly
its
a
good
beer
that
doesnt
let
its
vanilla
get
in
the
way
and
instead
lets
it
accent
the
beer
first
glance
would
suggest
a
very
drinkable
beer
due
to
the
nice
flavor
moderate
complexity
and
low
abv
but
the
vanilla
and
overt
sweetness
would
become
burdening
for
be
relatively
quickly
thats
not
to
say
its
not
a
moderately
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
a
pretty
good
stout
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
body
roasted
sweetness
and
perhaps
even
an
elevated
vanilla
character
though
this
beer
stays
a
safer
level
which
is
fine
coming
from
a
bottle
this
beer
does
not
have
a
creamy
enough
mouthfeel
for
what
i
want
from
a
stout
i
have
had
some
bottled
stouts
that
were
excellent
but
this
is
too
light
and
carbonated
the
idea
for
the
flavor
isnt
bad
but
just
a
little
too
sweet
dthe
artificial
vanilla
taste
really
screws
things
up
this
is
not
a
good
beer
d
well
i
do
have
three
more
and
may
save
the
for
further
on
a
drinking
night
or
maybe
after
a
really
hoppy
ipa
if
your
like
me
dont
go
in
expecting
it
to
taste
like
creme
brulee
more
like
a
dundee
stout
with
extract
added
pass
d
not
a
big
fan
its
a
sipper
due
to
the
heavier
vanilla
flavors
but
the
artificial
nature
really
got
to
me
its
not
horrible
just
not
terribly
enjoyable
im
not
likely
to
revisit
this
one
cheers
i
like
stouts
and
like
vanilla
i
did
not
really
like
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
average
it
was
was
to
light
of
a
bodied
beer
to
have
the
vanilla
thrown
in
and
that
was
the
focus
dthis
is
a
fun
easy
drinking
stout
the
tastes
stay
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
i
hope
to
see
this
again
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
thin
and
finishes
very
dry
not
too
pleasant
in
a
stout
filled
with
vanilla
overall
this
beer
is
okay
but
i
would
certainly
tire
of
the
fake
vanilla
and
its
attributes
i
might
compare
this
to
the
breckenridge
beer
of
similar
name
maybe
its
called
471
or
somethingin
that
both
are
artificial
and
thin
and
quite
unmemorable
i
would
pass
on
this
in
the
future
this
is
my
first
vanilla
stout
so
i
cant
compare
to
others
of
the
style
however
this
is
good
stuff
meeting
the
standards
and
for
the
price
cannot
be
beat
saranac
i
do
like
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
roasted
malt
coffee
notes
and
a
small
vanilla
hint
in
the
taste
coffee
chocolate
small
roasted
malts
and
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
roasty
coffee
and
vanilla
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
thin
a
bit
sweet
for
me
but
good
flavors
nice
beer
well
done
and
in
balance
d
i
found
it
fairly
drinkable
i
didnt
think
the
deep
roasted
flavors
were
too
overpowering
d
while
this
beer
isnt
bad
it
just
isnt
working
out
too
well
for
me
the
vanilla
doesnt
add
to
the
beer
it
takes
away
from
it
making
it
not
all
that
easy
to
drink
this
beer
if
had
at
the
colder
end
of
4555
is
quite
drinkable
and
can
be
easily
chugged
down
comparative
to
most
stouts
ive
had
and
reviewed
which
are
not
i
would
not
seek
this
beer
out
nor
would
i
order
it
in
a
bar
unless
i
was
hit
up
for
cash
or
the
rest
of
the
beer
selection
was
terrible
its
still
a
decent
porter
there
are
just
better
ones
available
overall3
had
in
a
12oz
bottle
had
a
very
good
head
but
struggled
to
find
that
hint
of
vanilla
had
a
real
nice
floral
smell
very
fine
cocoa
taste
with
espresso
still
no
vanilla
the
fell
was
a
lot
lighter
than
a
thought
but
very
refreshing
and
yet
warming
even
though
i
was
looking
for
that
sweetness
of
vanilla
that
was
hardly
noticed
this
stout
was
very
good
and
i
would
have
another
pretty
dark
with
some
red
at
the
edges
smells
great
nice
and
chocolatey
tastes
a
bit
watery
and
i
cant
find
the
vanilla
at
all
some
nice
roasty
chocolate
and
coffee
finish
is
semi
sweet
leaning
to
the
dry
bottle
recommends
eating
this
with
some
winter
sweets
and
they
are
right
alone
its
just
and
average
stout
my
least
favorite
of
the
twelve
beers
of
winter
but
with
some
warm
buttermilk
cinnamon
streusel
cake
its
pretty
darn
good
this
one
pours
with
a
huge
foam
head
and
smells
good
and
toasty
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
vanilla
is
more
noticable
in
the
taste
however
it
is
an
unwelcome
addition
to
a
stout
the
body
is
surprisingly
lacks
density
but
does
have
a
good
dry
finish
first
sip
is
sweet
artificial
vanilla
flavor
is
dominating
and
not
particularly
pleasant
the
sweet
vanilla
flavor
hides
any
of
the
malt
flavor
and
there
is
a
bit
of
a
tinny
aftertaste
i
think
saranac
went
a
little
overboard
on
the
vanilla
extract
here
this
was
part
of
the
12
beers
of
christmas
pack
hopefully
it
doesnt
make
the
cut
next
year
definitely
a
vanilla
stout
to
try
if
youre
into
them
had
this
from
a
saranac
winter
variety
pack
at
a
holiday
gathering
i
wouldve
drank
these
all
night
if
i
didnt
want
to
try
some
other
selections
and
i
didnt
have
to
drive
home
theres
nothing
particularly
outstanding
or
unique
about
this
beer
rather
its
just
very
well
done
pretty
drinkable
beer
like
a
lot
of
saranac
offerings
sorry
saranac
you
make
some
decent
beers
but
i
dont
know
how
you
let
this
one
make
it
out
of
the
brewery
you
can
do
way
better
d
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
while
sitting
around
the
house
in
the
winter
i
would
drink
one
or
two
but
probably
not
more
than
that
at
a
time
its
not
a
beer
you
want
to
drink
while
going
bar
hopping
d
if
you
enjoy
stouts
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
one
id
buy
a
sixer
of
maybe
im
just
not
into
vanilla
stouts
or
maybe
this
beers
just
not
that
great
but
its
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorites
still
worth
a
try
especially
as
part
of
the
variety
pack
d
extremely
drinkable
the
body
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
but
that
makes
it
super
smooth
and
crisp
the
flavors
are
nice
and
sweet
from
the
vanilla
so
it
says
very
drinkable
pretty
rich
but
its
medium
bodied
characteristic
makes
it
a
pretty
drinkable
stout
there
are
betters
stouts
out
there
but
i
am
not
disappointed
with
this
one
drinkability
for
a
more
mediumbodied
stout
this
isnt
too
bad
and
its
a
good
one
for
the
12
mix
from
saranac
this
winter
the
taste
and
drinkability
were
disappointing
it
first
sip
it
tastes
like
it
smells
kind
of
malty
and
chocolaty
they
out
of
no
where
comes
a
hoppy
bitterness
that
lingers
and
lingers
and
lingers
very
strange
and
the
drastic
contrast
through
each
drink
i
dont
care
for
at
all
with
the
lingering
bitterness
its
hard
to
keep
going
back
for
more
im
a
huge
supporter
and
fan
of
saranacs
but
this
one
seemed
to
miss
the
boat
for
me
d
not
bad
enjoyed
it
but
i
believe
a
better
vanilla
would
have
pushed
this
one
higher
overall
an
decent
stout
and
one
of
the
better
saranac
brews
definitely
needs
to
be
thicker
but
i
appreciate
the
lower
abv
my
pal
justin
gave
this
one
to
me
from
his
variety
pack

the

i
sat
on
this
one
for
a
while
letting
it
warm
up
but
it
is
just
a
boring
sweet
vanilla
bomb
of
a
beer
its
just
very
one
dimensional
same
goes
for
the
flavor
its
simply
boring
its
vanilla
and
roasted
malts
the
vanilla
is
sweet
and
its
all
that
i
can
really
notice
kind
of
a
lighter
body
on
this
guy
and
id
prefer
if
the
carbonation
was
toned
down
a
bit
but
its
fair
enough
honestly
this
went
down
pretty
well
but
i
didnt
love
it
all
i
could
think
was
that
i
could
be
having
a
better
beer
nothing
offensive
in
this
one

you

the
beer
is
going
to
taste

sweeter
than
it
does
but
the
fullness
of
the
stout
brings
some
boldness
to
the
beer
with
overdoing
the
vanilla
not
a
terrible
beer
by
any
stretch
but
not
particularly
good
either
the
sort
of
flawed
mediocre
beer
that
has
defined
the
saranac
products
i
have
experienced
thus
far
that
said
it
is
significantly
cheaper
than
most
craft
beers
and
ultimatly
the
price
point
is
what
drives

i
can

the
bitterness
that
it
leaves
behind
is
not
the
most
pleasant
forcing
me
to
keep
sipping
to
taste
something
else
i
love
vanilla
and
believe
that
it
could
be
a
little
more
bold
and
so
could
the

12oz
bottle
from
the
12
beers

a
deep

almost
black
color
with
a

sized

head
decent
amount
of
lacing
aromas
of
coffee
roasted

a
hint
of

an
overall
sweetness
taste
is
sweet
as
well
a
mix
of
caramel
light
coffee
and
vanilla
flavors
and
some
roasted
malts
one
of
the
beers
that
really
shine
through
in
the
winter
pack
definitely
worth
looking
for
d
not
a
bad
brew
for
being
part
of
a
mixer
its
just
not
what
you
want
for
a
stout
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
take
on
a
stout
and
thought
it
was
a
very
well
rounded
brew
d
very
drinkable
tastes
great
and
is
a
real
gem
d
i
probably
wont
ever
buy
this
beer
again
but
may
attempt
to
brew
something
of
my
own
with
some
slightly
less
vanilla
d
i
could
drink
this
while
playing
cards
this
reminds
me
a
bit
of
guinness
extra
stout
but
not
quite
as
good
sorta
reminds
me
of
a
pacific
nw
pale
ale
meeting
a
stout
interesting
pours
a
black
color
that
is
thick
and
not
see
through
with
a
slight
head
that
is
slightly
off
white
the
smell
is
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
malts
the
smell
is
sweet
and
inviting
the
taste
is
of
vanilla
and
a
slight
chocolate
malt
the
taste
is
faint
and
slightly
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
slightly
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
good
nothing
offensive
about
the
beer
but
the
taste
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
it
is
slightly
watery
and
not
thick
enough
for
a
stout
other
than
the
nut
brown
were
excellent
i
will
definitely
be
buying
a
few
of
these
half
cases
in
the
winter
a
disappointment
with
or
without
the
vanilla
portion
moderately
drinkable
but
perhaps
a
slight
bit
too
astringent
and
roasty
to
really
provoke
quaffability
though
a
low
abv
doesnt
hurt
things
at
all
for
a
vanillaimbued
ale
though
things
fit
together
quite
well
without
the
vanilla
showing
itself
overtly
and
providing
a
nice
restrained
addition
to
both
aroma
and
flavor
d
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
brew
glad
i
got
it
as
an
extra
this
is
a
local
that
i
would
recommend
anyone
in
the
area
to
check
out
d
a
noce
mouthfeel
and
taste
combiantion
makes
this
beer
a
very
nice
drinking
beer
the
vanilla
mixed
well
with
the
stout
but
was
just
a
little
too
subtle
overall
pretty
good
drinking
beer
and
recommended
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
stout
at
all
it
is
decently
flavorful
for
the
low
abv
worth
a
try
it
tastes
to
me
like
what
burnt
tires
and
a
dash
of
vanilla
extract
would
taste
like
im
dissapointed
because
it
looked
really
nice
when
pouring
mouthfeel
is
very
very
thin
and
just
doesnt
seem
right
for
the
style
this
one
is
destined
to
be
pored
down
the
drain
unfortunately
this
stout
is
quite
dry
and
a
touch
prickly
on
the
tongue
from
some
of
the
underlying
hops
there
is
a
bit
of
a
vanilla
extract
or
maybe
a
touch
of
vanilla
bean
or
maybe
a
slight
walnut
taste
to
the
beer
and
im
assuming
that
was
the
vanilla
added
in
however
you
categorize
it
its
an
okay
beer
that
does
have
a
roasted
slightly
charred
character
from
the
dark
malts
used
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
nothing
that
im
excited
for
the
beer
is
less
creamy
than
i
would
have
anticipated
the
more
i
drink
it
the
less
impressed
im
getting
so
i
better
stop
here
one
of
my
favorites
from
saranac
it
is
a
good
stout
with
good
drinkability
just
came
up
short
in
my
opinion
final
thoughts
i
got
this
beer
in
the
winter
mix
pack
definitely
fine
when
there
are
only
two
of
them
in
there
other
than
the
ability
to
try
it
i
would
generally
find
better
alternatives
the
mouthfeel
is
what
throws
this
beer
off
pretty
far
off
the
feel
is
certainly
more
porter
like
than
stout
the
carbonation
is
way
too
high
the
bitterness
is
too
high
as
well
a
decent
beverage
yes
but
true
to
the
style
it
is
not
drinkability
is
not
too
bad
i
could
put
back
a
few
of
these
if
my
other
options
were
all
macros
and
such
not
sure
if
i
will
try
again
drank
this
after
bottling
my
homebrew
ipa
and
drinking
a
lot
of
ipa
so
my
palate
was
definately
not
in
the
right
place
but
i
was
pretty
sure
this
wasnt
going
to
be
the
best
beer
in
the
world
so
i
didnt
really
care
appearence
is
nice
completely
opaque
black
with
an
abundant
creamy
tan
head
that
stuck
around
for
awhile
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
mostly
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
with
some
chocolate
and
not
as
much
vanilla
as
expected
but
i
considered
this
a
good
thing
because
all
the
flavored
saranac
beers
ive
had
were
very
artificial
tasting
very
light
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
too
much
carbonation
the
taste
was
coffee
some
raosted
malts
and
hints
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
in
the
finish
as
this
one
warmed
up
the
vanilla
was
definately
way
more
present
both
in
the
taste
and
aroma
it
was
a
rather
fake
artificial
tasting
vanilla
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
this
again
unless
given
too
me
just
lacks
real
flavor
for
a
stout
i
wouldnt
reccomend
this
one
the
light
body
and
high
carbonation
really
ruined
it
for
me
also
pretty
watery
overall
a
tasty
stout
with
a
nice
dryness
pours
a
dark
brown
cream
colored
head
head
dissapates
to
a
thin
layer
excellent
lacing
heavy
malt
aroma
full
tasting
sweet
malt
taste
nice
mouthfeel
definitely
a
winter
beer
not
tasting
the
vanilla
though
has
a
coffee
taste
which
is
rather
pleasant
good
drinkability
in
its
class
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
from
the
saranac
winter
pack
its
not
outstanding
but
its
fairly
interesting
and
has
a
bit
of
character
this
drinks
well
enough
despite
little
detractors
slightly
burnt
minor
sour
there
is
a
chocolatecoffee
thing
going
on
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
a
nice
enough
effort
though
just
short
of
being
something
better
out
of
mixed
sixpack
this
dark
entry
to
my
log
was
an
opaque
brownblack
color
with
a
two
and
a
half
finger
head
of
brown
foam
the
retention
of
the
thin
cap
was
pretty
good
and
it
left
bands
of
chunky
lacing
down
my
glass
the
aroma
was
muted
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
coffee
the
flavors
were
better
but
still
not
exactly
thrilling
roasted
malt
big
espressolike
bitterness
and
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
pipe
tobacco
very
little
sweetness
to
it
and
i
only
got
the
vanilla
at
the
very
end
of
the
experience
the
mouthfeel
was
slick
but
semicreamy
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
medium
i
just
felt
it
lacked
the
vanilla
and
full
body
notes
that
should
define
a
vanilla
stout
taste
the
flavor
is
overwhelmed
by
the
vanilla
bean
but
its
quickly
followed
by
chocolate
or
cocoa
and
a
hoppy
finish
it
is
actually
a
rather
interesting
experience
but
nothing
extraordinary
pours
a
nice
thick
black
color
with
a
bit
of
small
head
and
some
nice
lacing
good
stout
scent
nice
burnt
grains
decent
coffee
undertone
with
a
whiff
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
nice
although
i
find
vanilla
to
be
an
odd
stout
flavor
nice
dark
flavor
with
excellent
coffee
tones
with
the
vanilla
going
in
and
out
of
the
taste
nice
bit
of
bittering
hops
at
the
end
of
the
pull
goes
down
fine
a
nice
beer
again
the
only
thing
that
really
hurt
it
is
that
im
finding
myself
not
keen
on
vanilla
in
stouts
dont
drink
and
review
d
the
low
abv
is
appreciated
but
this
american
stout
falls
when
compared
to
its
competition
except
perhaps
in
terms
of
appearance
there
are
too
many
excellent
american
stouts
to
consider
this
brew
in
the
future
a
nice
addition
to
the
winter
variety
pack
but
not
overly
impressive
drinkability
i
could
have
about
three
one
of
saranacs
better
offerings
i
like
breckinridges
vanilla
stout
better
for
the
style
but
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
overall
great
sweet
and
coffee
induced
flavor
could
drink
these
for
a
while
not
a
bad
looking
stout
though
somewhat
less
opaque
than
some
the
color
is
a
very
deep
brown
bordering
on
black
with
some
visible
carbonation
going
up
to
the
light
tan
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
round
the
glass
the
smell
is
mostly
whats
expected
from
stout
toffee
roasted
malt
maybe
some
fruit
but
with
a
sweet
candylike
component
there
also
vanilla
syrup
the
taste
is
also
your
basic
stout
with
just
a
tad
bit
more
sweetness
balanced
by
a
good
dose
of
citrusy
hops
the
feel
in
the
mouth
is
somewhat
more
than
thin
yet
not
full
and
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
with
a
lingering
citrus
and
chocolate
taste
overall
very
easy
to
drink
not
outstanding
but
a
very
decent
brew
my
only
question
is
how
much
vanilla
is
in
there
as
i
seem
to
have
missed
it
entirely
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
from
saranac
the
aroma
is
very
nice
with
deep
roasted
malts
chocolate
vanilla
coffee
and
cream
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
but
has
an
astringent
bite
the
palate
is
to
thin
for
a
stout
overall
a
nice
stout
but
not
too
special
pours
a
transparent
deep
red
brown
color
with
a
monster
light
brown
head
that
leaves
some
sticking
mild
nose
of
bitter
chocolate
malt
and
creamy
vanilla
extract
wow
bitter
stout
but
not
good
bitter
offbitter
the
false
vanilla
flavor
packs
a
wicked
bitter
blast
initially
the
roasted
malts
dont
even
have
the
opportunity
to
counter
balance
the
assault
grainy
and
light
in
body
ill
be
a
trooper
through
this
glass
but
i
wont
have
another
any
time
soon
mouthfeeldrinkability
active
and
quick
the
carbonation
is
right
for
a
stout
the
flavors
are
brought
out
albeit
not
very
complex
its
an
easy
beer
without
question
it
just
doesnt
have
that
edge
that
would
ever
make
me
want
to
revisit
this
d
not
too
bad
to
be
honest
i
would
like
the
beer
quite
a
bit
without
the
vanilla
the
vanilla
is
very
fake
tasting
i
like
the
bold
bitter
base
stout
though
overall
not
bad
at
the
price
point
that
saranac
puts
their
beers
out
at
1
5
d
since
the
taste
is
weirdsucks
this
beer
is
not
very
drinkable
even
though
the
rest
of
its
attributes
are
pretty
damn
good
12

12
beers

bl
glass
the
beer
pours
very
dark
brownblack
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
lacing
and
head
retention
are
both
good
the
aroma
is
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
with
a
little
bit
of
vanilla
aroma
is
on
the
weak
side
but
not
bad
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
although
there
is
some
coffee
i
can
taste
and
also
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
bitter
finish
however
for
a
beer
called
a
vanilla
stout
i
expected
more
vanilla
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
seems
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
drinkability
is
ok
its
smooth
and
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
overall
i
think
its
a
decent
enough
beer
but
as
far
as
stouts
go
there
are
plenty
i
would
choose
before
this
one
however
it
is
worth
a
try
as
its
not
bad
will
never
buy
saranac
again
d
not
bad
the
thinness
probably
makes
this
a
little
easier
to
drink
not
a
bad
brew
d
this
is
a
decent
vanilla
porter
i
dont
think
id
want
another
one
though
some
of
the
burnt
malt
character
makes
it
a
bit
astringent
fx
matt
makes
so
many
other
beers
that
are
superior
i
must
say
though
the
appearance
on
this
one
was
quite
good
i
dont
know
why
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
saranac
stout
maybe
it
was
the
christmas
cheer
in
the
air
oh
well
not
a
bad
stout
but
there
are
far
better
out
there
year
round
let
alone
among
winter
varietals
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
w
a
thin
tan
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
in
my
nonic
a
smoky
slightly
vinous
aroma
laden
w
vanilla
not
quite
as
strong
as
i
had
anticipated
flavor
is
a
dark
toasted
grain
and
more
vanilla
a
slightly
bitter
finish
prob
attributed
to
the
roasted
barley
nice
blend
of
flavors
in
this
one
a
slightly
dry
light
bodied
brew
w
average
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
wish
they
had
this
in
sixers
overall
a
pretty
solid
stout
offering
from
saranac
ive
given
up
hope
of
ever
being
impressed
when
i
crack
open
a
tmbc
brew
that
said
this
isnt
a
bad
little
vanilla
stout
in
fact
its
much
more
deserving
of
yearround
status
than
most
of
matts
yearround
releases
d
a
very
solid
beer
definitely
good
for
desserts
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
though
due
to
the
bitterness

something
to

enjoy

drinkers
will

pleasing
and
easy
to

this
beer
came
off
as
very
dry
irish
in
character
to
me
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
to
it
i
was
expecting
a
much
heavier
feel
and
more
pronounced
vanilla
flavor
overall
a
nice
stout
and
welcome
addition
to
the
winter
12pack
the
heavy
roasted
malt
flavors
rule
the
taste
here
from
beginning
to
end
seeming
very
reminiscent
of
an
irish
stout
with
hints
of
oatmeal
there
is
caramel
and
a
touch
of
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
the
texture
could
stand
some
thickening
overall
this
is
drinkable
and
fine
but
not
quite
a
top
notch
stout
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
one
of
the
better
vanilla
stouts
around
md
very
creamy
feel
to
it
and
a
bitter
ending
leaves
me
with
not
really
liking
this
one
a
whole
lot
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
vanilla
but
i
dont
i
would
have
liked
it
either
if
it
did
have
it
poured
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
very
thick
creamy
head
with
nice
lacing
deep
black
color
nontranslucent
tastes
of
caramel
hardly
any
vanilla
as
it
suggests
a
good
mouthful
and
goes
down
very
smooth
i
would
say
good
not
a
must
try
but
definitely
if
your
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
drinkability
well
they
certainly
skimped
on
the
vanilla
and
during
the
holidays
too
pity
another
lackluster
saranac
brew
seems
a
bit
too
artificial
maybe
i
am
just
not
fond
of
vanilla
in
a
beer
but
its
missed
something
on
me
had
another
bottle
of
this
tonight
after
i
forgot
about
it
sitting
in
my
cellar
and
it
appears
this
one
got
stronger
i
definetley
dont
remember
the
dark
roasty
ester
taste
in
the
finish
but
now
that
im
having
it
again
it
is
such
an
inviting
warming
brew
this
one
is
probably
the
favorite
out
of
the
saranac
winter
pack
a
good
blend
of
vanilla
without
going
out
of
control
and
now
that
it
taste
a
tad
stronger
its
a
bigger
winner
in
my
book
an
excellent
job
from
matt
brewing
overall
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
winter
sampler
i
wont
be
drinking
the
second
one
soon
but
i
will
definitely
have
it
some
day
this
is
my
first
saranac
beer
theyve
got
me
a
little
curious
so
ill
be
looking
for
more
of
there
stuff
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
but
nothing
all
that
special
not
bad
its
drinkable
pours
black
with
a
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
long
time
the
smell
is
sweet
with
heavy
vanilla
notes
also
has
a
nice
malt
aroma
and
some
alcohol
notes
the
taste
isnt
as
sweet
as
expected
but
still
there
a
nice
malty
vanilla
flavor
with
some
odd
notes
in
the
aftertaste
a
decent
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
not
as
heavy
as
expected
but
still
somewhat
full
bodied
this
one
is
an
ok
drinker
the
flavor
could
get
to
you
but
is
a
nice
stout
worth
checking
out
brew
poured
to
a
deep
black
color
with
a
good
thick
medium
tan
colored
head
that
has
very
good
retention
and
has
left
a
great
deal
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
comes
off
a
slightly
tinged
with
an
burnt
astringency
the
vanilla
is
very
faint
in
the
nose
i
am
not
sure
if
i
am
really
picking
it
up
but
it
might
be
sweet
aroma
that
is
sneaking
through
the
flavor
is
good
though
it
breaks
to
a
harsh
bitterness
that
i
believe
would
be
from
the
heavy
roasted
is
not
burnt
malts
also
has
some
chocolate
and
coffee
overtones
with
the
chocolate
lingering
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
again
a
good
addition
to
this
years
christmas
beer
line
up
quite
easy
drinking
though
the
burnt
astringency
would
get
to
me
after
2
or
3
the
carbonation
is
good
but
the
body
seems
to
be
a
little
watery
d
eh
moderately
decent
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
appears
an
opaque
black
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
head
forms
thick
with
a
rising
biscuit
appearance
lacing
is
fine
but
even
all
around
my
imperial
pint
aroma
has
some
pleasant
vanilla
extract
its
not
overpowering
or
alcholic
in
nature
with
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
tones
as
well
a
dry
powdered
doughnut
sweetness
is
there
with
a
touch
of
herbal
hop
tones
flavor
is
okay
too
much
dry
dark
chocolate
bitterness
flowing
around
with
watery
coffee
mix
and
semi
burnt
sugar
glazed
with
vanilla
extract
light
on
alcohol
and
herbal
hops
fuller
bodied
for
a
saranac
offering
but
for
a
stout
its
a
bit
thin
carbonation
is
on
and
drinkability
due
to
the
nice
abv
brings
on
a
level
of
sessionability
a
solid
offering
that
will
keep
stout
fans
excited
its
still
nice
to
see
these
big
breweries
pulling
of
craft
styles
especially
beloved
regionals
like
fx
matt
and
high
falls
very
easy
to
put
a
few
back
if
stouts
are
your
mug
of
beer
notes
i
would
say
that
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
i
an
not
really
sure
that
i
like
the
vanilla
flavoring
and
so
for
me
drinkability
suffers
for
me
it
seems
to
close
to
bitter
vanilla
cola
this
beer
pours
a
nearly
black
color
with
a
tan
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
quite
nicely
the
smell
has
a
bit
of
vanilla
up
front
with
the
requisite
roasted
malt
in
the
back
the
taste
follows
with
sweet
malt
and
vanilla
at
the
front
finishing
with
a
bit
of
bitter
malt
flavor
the
body
was
medium
at
best
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
light
mouthfeel
makes
it
a
quick
drink
though
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
scent
with
subtle
hints
of
vanilla
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
dry
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
stiff
black
malt
backbone
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
with
hints
of
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
well
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
stout
but
its
nothing
to
get
excited
about
mfd
thinmedium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
a
little
more
vanilla
flavor
would
have
made
this
stout
a
lot
better
worth
checking
out
smells
like
a
watered
down
vanilla
late
from
mcdonalds
tastes
like
one
too
the
roasted
malt
and
strong
coffee
flavors
one
usually
associates
with
stouts
isnt
here
its
just
a
mild
maltiness
followed
by
a
heavy
vanilla
with
some
hop
attachment
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
i
loved
this
beer
this
stout
is
scary
drinkable
with
just
a
touch
of
vanilla
so
you
know
its
there
but
it
isnt
enough
to
drink
like
a
vanilla
soda
is
super
smooth
and
the
body
is
great
low
in
abv
so
it
doesnt
knock
you
down
and
could
use
more
in
smell
but
other
than
that
its
a
terrific
beer
pours
nice
and
black
with
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
of
vanilla
with
some
dark
malts
receding
in
the
background
and
a
nice
contribution
from
the
hops
which
is
good
to
see
in
an
american
stout
taste
is
pretty
astringent
with
a
lot
of
flavor
coming
from
the
vanilla
it
has
a
sodalike
character
and
a
lot
of
the
roasted
malt
flavor
is
compromised
by
the
astringency
mouthfeel
is
light
for
a
stout
but
not
unpleasant
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
think
this
is
too
great
of
a
beer
pours
a
black
engine
oil
color
looks
thick
too
a
huge
deep
tan
head
fills
to
the
top
of
the
pint
and
stays
until
the
end
has
great
lacing
all
the
way
through
taste
is
very
bitter
then
smooths
to
water
tasting
nutty
flavor
going
on
too
doesnt
come
together
well
not
the
best
stout
actually
not
a
good
stout
medium
bodied
and
smooth
not
bad
a
solid
vanillaladen
beer
sweet
and
a
bit
roasted
tasty
in
a
mainstream
way
its
also
worth
noting
that
ive
been
letting
this
beer
warm
a
little
as
ive
been
tasting
it
i
think
its
actually
better
cold
this
brew
has
gotten
drier
and
less
vanillalike
as
it
warmed
d
okay
this
wasnt
quite
what
i
expectedwanted
but
its
quaffable
not
terrible
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
very
smooth
and
creamy
almost
fluffy
in
the
mouth
a
good
drinker
and
a
really
surprisinglygood
beer
from
saranac
drinkability
is
good
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
and
if
this
was
available
in
a
6
pack
like
the
carmel
porter
or
pumpkin
ale
id
definately
buy
it
d
plenty
of
flavor
here
for
a
sub5
abv
beer
this
is
good
on
its
on
and
would
be
good
with
food
as
well
this
is
a
really
well
done
vanilla
beer
with
the
vanilla
playing
a
supporting
role
and
not
overpowering
the
beer
this
beer
poured
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
big
fluffy
twofinger
head
the
smell
is
surprisingly
more
stout
than
vanilla
with
some
toasty
malt
and
coffee
with
a
little
vanilla
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
little
coffee
that
gives
way
to
some
hops
with
just
a
tiny
bit
of
vanilla
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
has
a
little
thickness
with
some
finebubbled
carbonation
i
wouldnt
consider
this
beer
to
be
too
drinkable
but
about
average
for
a
stout
pours
a
nearly
black
with
a
three
finger
tan
head
that
slowly
dies
down
to
a
creamy
layer
of
foam
spotty
spiderweb
type
lacing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
consists
of
roasted
grains
wet
cardboard
and
some
chocoalte
malts
the
vanilla
is
very
subdued
in
the
nose
which
is
good
because
saranac
has
been
known
to
go
a
bit
over
the
top
with
flavored
beers
taste
is
very
smokey
much
more
than
i
had
anticipated
charred
grains
roasted
barley
and
dark
chocolate
malts
up
front
with
a
slight
vanilla
extract
sweetness
earthy
hops
and
dirty
oak
midway
on
the
tongue
with
a
fairly
dry
coffee
grind
aftertaste
harsh
bitter
feel
with
a
medium
body
and
mild
carbonation
this
doesnt
have
the
explosion
of
flavoring
like
the
caramel
porter
which
is
nice
the
vanilla
is
there
but
in
check
for
the
most
part
not
bad
could
be
borderline
session
beer
for
some
at
4
8
abv
d
not
a
bad
stout
but
is
surpassed
by
many
others
im
not
sure
vanilla
works
as
well
with
the
stout
style
as
it
does
in
porters
nice
and
drinkable
stout
here
could
use
a
bit
more
vanilla
flavor
being
that
they
can
make
decent
american
stouts
i
wonder
what
their
imperial
stout
tastes
like
regardless
this
is
worth
a
try
at
least
once
