interesting
not
as
strong
a
clove
presence
as
some
other
pumpkin
beers
much
lighter
but
still
enjoyable
would
purchase
again
the
better
of
the
best
pumpkins
ales
i
loved
it
overall
a
swell
pumpkin
ale
this
or
smuttynose
will
likely
be
my
goto
pumpkin
beer
since
its
2014
and
everyone
needs
one
happy
halloween
this
ones
not
nearly
as
bad
as
the
bros
review
or
even
the
overall
ba
score
would
indicate
if
you
like
your
pumpkin
beers
to
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
then
keep
looking
try
a
whole
hog
pumpkin
or
that
tsp
of
vanilla
extract
per
bottle
beer
that
everyone
on
ba
likes
so
much
pumking
this
falls
in
line
with
alot
of
the
wolavers
stuff
ive
had
in
that
its
not
a
wow
beer
but
theres
also
not
much
wrong
with
it
its
a
beer
you
arent
going
to
fall
in
love
with
but
its
also
an
easy
drinker
in
a
category
that
seems
to
go
way
overboard
with
flavors
if
youre
gonna
have
just
one
this
probably
isnt
the
one
but
its
a
nice
followup
to
drink
after
punching
yourself
in
the
face
with
some
of
the
other
pumpkins
out
there
try
it
after
you
drank
something
called
imperial
pumpkin
something
or
other
and
youll
be
glad
you
did

like
it
this
brew
is
amazing
its
not
pumpkin

southern

version
however
it
still
kicks
arse
it
has
that
delicious
standard
beer
flavor
with
a
great
almost
bittersweet
pumpkin
flavor
its
in
my
top
5
of
favorite
pumpkin
ales
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
i
could
drink
this
any
time
in
the
season
in
which
it
is
released
if
it
was
the
only
seasonal
available
but
i
would
probably
choose
other
seasonal
brews
if
they
were
available
it
is
somewhat
unremarkable
but
good
for
the
beginning
of
the
season
when
you
still
have
some
of
that
summer
heat
around
and
are
just
beginning
to
head
into
harvest
season
this
beer
is
pretty
unexceptional
its
not
bad
but
not
that
great
either
i
get
pretty
standard
notes
of
pumpkin
and
spices
like
nutmeg
and
brown
sugar
on
the
nose
leading
to
a
very
mild
flavor
on
the
palate
i
hardly
get
any
pumpkin
and
more
of
a
slight
spice
tone
it
feels
slightly
bland
to
me
its
better
than
all
others
in
the
volavers
organic
assorted
beers
collection
next
time
i
would
go
and
buy
this
alone
than
the
other
volavers
ales
to
mention
i
never
like
those
dark
colored
alesbeers
which
would
taste
a
bit
like
chocolate
this
was
a
good
tasting
beer
very
sweet
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
zucchini
and
hints
of
wolavers
pumpkin
ale
banana
bread
theres
also
a
good
deal
of
fall
spices
particularly
cinnamon
though
the
sweetness
takes
over
the
taste
follows
very
sweet
up
front
and
at
the
end
with
a
bit
of
a
toffee
character
to
the
malt
the
middle
has
some
of
the
actual
pumpkin
flavor
with
weird
banana
notes
overall
this
one
was
too
sweet
for
me
i
assume
wolavers
uses
only
organic
pumpkins
in
the
brew
process
but
the
flavor
tastes
similar
to
artificial
pumpkin
to
me
i
have
a
nice
clean
glass
fresh
from
the
dishwasher

the
pour
went

original

but
on
a
retired
beer
incorrectly
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
travel
for
it
o
not
a
ton
of
pumpkin
here
but
still
a
nice
amount
of
spice
resulting
in
a
tasty
fall
beer
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
it
has
a
dark
orange
color
body
with
a
small
head
the
smell
has
a
very
punget
smell
of
nutmeg
the
taste
has
a
overpowering
taste
of
nutmeg
and
spices
it
has
some
pumpkin
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
an
overall
is
a
ok
pumpkin
beer
o
very
good
apparently
its
way
underrated
my
only
gripe
is
that
it
is
not
as
meaty
as
others
such
as
punkin
or
whole
hog
from
stevens
point
but
worth
a
try
for
sure
a
fairly
standard
pumpkin
ale
that
could
stand
to
have
more
pumpkin
in
the
flavor
but
is
otherwise
decent
if
forgettable
worth
trying
but
not
nearly
the
best
pumpkin
ale
out
there
overall
coming
into
this
beer
i
was
a
bit
hopeful
considering
this
was
an
organic
beer
im
all
about
the
pumpkin
beers
right
now
and
was
hoping
to
find
a
delicious
brew
that
sticks
out
this
one
wasnt
particular
in
my
favor
pretty
plain
some
flavors
did
come
out
and
memorable
but
overall
not
very
exciting
i
probably
wouldnt
have
again
but
i
may
recommend
to
a
friend
better
luck
next
time
cheers
pours
a
hazy
dark
copper
colour
with
a
limited
white
that
has
good
retention
well
balanced
yet
mild
aroma
of
pumpkin
fruit
and
subtle
pie
spices
the
flavour
is
equally
well
balanced
albeit
with
slightly
more
cloves
in
the
body
than
id
personally
choose
but
a
nice
blend
of
malts
and
pumpkin
and
cinnamonnutmeg
etc
this
is
a
dark
orange
beer
with
significant
haze
and
a
huge
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
dominated
by
ginger
and
cinnamon
not
much
malt
there
to
note
tastes
slightly
sweet
up
front
with
a
strong
bitter
bite
following
at
the
finish
the
spices
come
through
cinnamon
ginger
clove
very
dry
finish
theres
a
hint
of
soapiness
in
there
too
but
not
unpleasant
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
tough
of
astringency
overall
its
a
decent
beer
i
prefer
overdry
and
overspiced
to
cloyingly
sweet
in
pumpkin
beers
im
not
sure
id
go
back
for
this
one
as
its
a
bit
too
dry
and
hoppy
for
a
pumpkin
beer
but
its
a
decent
beer
slightly
opaque
orangey
caramel
colored
with
a
beige
head
that
leaves
a
fine
cap
of
fine
bubbles
and
rims
of
lace
up
the
sides
of
the
glass
low
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
hints
of
nutmeg
initial
flavors
of
vegetal
squash
and
malt
followed
quickly
by
sharp
spicey
nutmeg
flavor
which
is
overpowering
to
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
a
bit
tannic
overall
i
cant
finish
this
glass
overall
this
one
doesnt
stand
out
for
me
sure
its
balanced
because
no
one
flavor
steals
the
show
but
none
of
the
flavors
become
more
than
a
subtlety
just
a
matter
of
preference
but
i
like
bold
flavors
for
this
style
so
this
one
doesnt
cut
it
for
me
o
still
an
exceptional
fall
favorite
for
myself
its
weighed
a
little
more
on
the
pumpkin
side
which
is
what
i
feel
should
happen
not
an
overwhelming
bounty
of
spices
good
job
ocw
o
not
impressive
something
wrong
in
the
formulation
back
to
the
drawing
board
vt
organic
pumpkin
ale
should
rock
my
first
autumn
beer
of
the
year
even
though
its
only
the
beginning
of
august
this
is
tasty
but
not
necessarily
complex
or
even
interesting
the
beers
head
is
unremarkable
and
minimal
lacing
remains
the
pumpkin
flavor
tastes
fresh
and
theres
just
a
touch
of
spice
along
with
it
hops
and
malt
are
there
to
balance
fairly
well
with
the
pumpkin
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
but
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
to
pick
this
one
up
overall
this
was
enjoyable
but
mainly
just
because
i
like
the
style
i
disagree
with
many
reviewers
who
say
that
it
tastes
blandbut
maybe
this
years
release
has
more
pumpkin
flavor
anyway
while
i
enjoyed
it
i
wont
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
again
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazed
orangeamber
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
white
ring
around
the
surface
aromas
are
very
sweet
with
a
pumpkin
and
sweet
potato
backbone
supporting
a
light
spice
blend
of
nutmeg
and
allspice
flavors
are
light
with
a
caramel
syrup
foundation
that
overpowers
any
of
the
harvest
flavors
the
spicing
becomes
an
afterthought
and
you
might
be
able
to
catch
a
hint
of
nutmeg
if
you
really
swish
it
around
in
your
mouth
sharp
spiced
aftertaste
on
a
light
wilting
body
the
finish
is
limp
but
heavily
roasted
and
spiced
at
the
very
end
a
final
pop
for
a
brew
that
was
fading
fast
on
the
palate
not
a
great
brew
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
slighty
orange
amber
with
next
to
no
head
sall
lacing
with
a
little
bit
accumulated
on
the
sides
aroma
was
pretty
much
exclusively
pumpkin
reminded
me
of
canned
pumpkin
with
next
to
no
spices
taste
started
off
a
little
malty
then
picked
up
some
peppery
spice
before
leaving
a
pumpkin
puree
flavor
on
the
tongue
a
bit
like
an
over
spiced
pumpkin
pie
coated
pretty
well
but
definitely
had
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
was
expected
overall
a
flavorful
beer
one
to
savor
and
enjoy
and
not
drink
terribly
often
o
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
mild
spicing
almost
pale
alelagerish
in
its
lightness
which
is
a
bit
disappointing
for
a
cold
fall
day
i
would
agree
with
others
that
as
a
pumpkin
beer
it
definitely
could
pop
in
the
flavour
category
a
bit
more
along
with
being
a
little
heaviermalty
im
all
for
pumpkin
beers
that
actually
use
real
pumpkin
and
organic
at
that
but
was
left
wanting
more
with
this
one
if
youre
run
out
of
pumpkin
beers
to
try
in
your
store
or
are
in
the
vermont
area
its
worth
a
try
but
not
to
keep
going
back
to
unless
you
like
light
beers
then
hey
maybe
its
for
you
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
i
want
one
of
two
things
a
beer
thats
exactly
like
pumpkin
pie
or
a
beer
that
tastes
like
roasted
pumpkin
seeds
this
was
just
too
bland
for
me
but
i
do
acknowledge
that
some
people
just
arent
that
into
pumpkin
beers
this
one
is
for
them
the
head
on
this
beer
was
weak
with
little
retention
this
was
perhaps
the
only
negative
the
aroma
was
excellent
it
smelled
like
a
warm
pumpkin
pie
the
beer
had
a
great
hop
flavor
that
is
often
missing
in
this
style
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
gladly
have
a
second
in
general
a
good
beer
for
this
style
it
was
great
overall
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
that
does
a
good
job
of
combining
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
i
could
do
several
of
these
bonus
point
its
made
in
good
spirit
and
its
far
better
than
shipyards
pumpkinhead
which
is
horrible
as
craft
goes
also
better
than
anything
ever
made
by
bmc
so
thats
2
bonus
pts
o
good
appearance
and
a
nice
refined
nose
bump
this
up
to
average
but
its
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
quite
watery
and
with
a
bitter
fruity
sweetness
drinks
like
a
pumpkin
wheat
and
not
in
a
good
way
o
below
average
pumpkin
ale
it
leaves
a
lingering
malty
and
metal
type
of
effect
in
the
mouth
not
a
big
fan
toasted
grains
followed
by
pumpkin
pie
and
caramelly
malt
spices
cinnamon
clove
soap
floral
perfumey
and
vegetal
bitterness
take
it
to
the
finish
lingering
cucurb
vegetableness
and
some
spicedup
caramel
malt
medium
body
with
a
slightly
soapy
feel
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
the
mystery
abv
has
got
me
worried
though
this
beer
is
going
straight
to
my
head
yet
it
doesnt
seem
like
it
should
be
o
for
me
its
tasty
not
anything
to
rave
about
but
not
bad
either
i
guess
i
will
have
to
get
more
familiar
with
organic
beers
before
i
can
really
understand
and
appreciate
them
im
sure
most
of
you
will
feel
the
same
as
for
this
beer
i
will
happily
drink
it
down
to
the
very
last
sip
cheers
overall
this
is
a
very
simple
pumpkin
beer
which
i
can
appreciate
they
didnt
go
spice
crazy
and
they
kept
a
really
nice
upfront
pumpkin
flavor
that
is
full
and
cannot
be
ignored
well
done
wolavers

as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
this
one
is
top
notch
individual
tastes
will
vary
but
i
liked
this
one
maybe
the
age
mellowed
this
one
to
perfection
but
i
would
most
certainly
revisit
this
one
again
next
year
o
wolavers
does
a
nice
job
with
their
organic
beers
this
one
showcased
a
sweet
side
spicy
side
and
a
hoppy
side
with
not
one
standing
above
the
other
overall
decent
but
not
in
my
top
5
of
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
had
so
far
o
not
expecting
much
from
this
one
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
bold
spiciness
with
a
nice
underlying
caramel
malt
sweetness
providing
balance
id
consider
getting
it
again
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
smells
less
spiced
than
many
pumpkin
beers
and
the
smell
of
pumpkin
is
very
noticable
tastes
like
fall
squashy
and
a
touch
sweet
could
session
this
beer
all
night
because
it
isnt
overpowering
its
all
quite
understated
but
very
well
balanced
bravo
overall
a
mild
tasting
pumpkin
ale
with
a
slight
bitter
bite
of
spices
that
was
left
lingering
well
after
the
swallow
it
was
a
decent
brew
which
fits
with
the
style
rather
nicely
d
they
went
a
good
bit
too
light
on
this
one
it
just
doesnt
have
enough
base
to
carry
spicing
and
hops
and
to
hold
everything
else
together
a
bit
more
base
malt
backbone
body
and
perhaps
sweetness
and
this
would
be
right
in
the
hunt
still
as
is
it
is
far
better
than
some
of
the
thin
spritzy
sodalike
spice
bombs
that
are
out
there
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
yellow
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
mellow
spices
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
in
the
taste
a
faint
spice
of
cinnamon
and
a
mellow
pumpkin
flavor
a
spice
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
cinnamon
like
spice
in
the
aftertaste
very
mellow
and
faint
spices
eh
o
i
love
the
smell
of
this
beer
but
the
grassy
hops
is
killing
it
for
me
the
abv
seems
pretty
low
but
1
will
do
it
for
me
taste
is
very
well
balanced
i
generally
dont
like
pumpkin
beers
because
of
the
spices
but
they
are
fairly
understated
and
work
well
with
the
pumpkin
the
mouthfeel
is
ful
and
creamy
with
a
sharp
finish
overall
its
quite
good
o
this
has
decent
drinkability
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
decent
pumpkin
ale
it
is
a
little
bit
bland
but
its
still
pretty
nice
give
it
a
shot
the
flavor
is
an
improvement
a
little
very
dry
flavor
relatively
thin
body
with
a
spritzy
bubbles
light
on
the
pumpkin
and
the
expected
spices
short
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
not
for
thous
who
dont
like
this
style
maybe
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
pumpkin
beer
o
it
was
ok
overall
it
seemed
a
little
thin
it
drinks
fine
but
there
are
other
easy
to
attain
pumpkin
beers
that
i
would
rather
drink
o
i
personally
want
a
sweet
pumpkin
ale
but
this
was
too
earthy
and
dare
i
say
organic
tasting
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
just
not
my
style
of
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
little
bit
of
a
hazy
orange
brown
color
with
a
pretty
good
looking
white
head
on
top
the
head
retention
was
pretty
good
but
didnt
leave
any
lacing
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
pretty
good
aroma
of
spices
going
on
in
it
and
some
sweet
grains
too
the
taste
was
a
little
on
the
weak
side
it
had
enough
flavor
to
show
that
it
was
a
pumpkin
ale
but
just
not
enough
to
impress
me
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
decent
medium
bodied
with
a
light
creaminess
to
it
overall
it
could
have
been
a
little
better
but
it
wasnt
terrible
a
very
hazed
brew
with
a
moderate
head
that
fade
after
a
few
minutes
some
lace
and
a
light
covering
remain
pretty
fragrant
aroma
of
pumpkin
and
spices
some
biscuit
and
malt
underneath
and
clove
tinged
earthy
hopiness
taste
has
a
nice
graininess
wrapped
in
mild
pumpkin
pie
flavors
spices
are
a
bit
forward
of
the
gourd
but
not
a
bad
mix
finish
is
dry
and
earthy
a
mineral
edged
sourness
develops
in
the
back
of
the
finish
with
clove
and
light
notes
of
graham
feel
is
well
carbonated
and
crisp
with
a
light
weight
that
lends
itself
to
fall
quaffing
a
solid
effort
that
while
not
a
standout
has
enough
character
to
set
itself
apart
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
just
seems
watered
down
like
this
would
be
the
lite
pumpkin
ale
certainly
sessionable
theres
nothing
fake
or
overdone
about
this
pumpkin
ale
but
its
just
a
tad
too
thin
and
tangy
to
be
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
the
future
pours
a
hazy
orangish
copper
with
a
small
white
head
with
decent
retention
aromas
are
primarily
spicy
as
is
the
taste
theres
a
lot
of
nutmeg
cinammon
and
gingerbready
notes
on
the
nose
and
the
tongue
hops
are
not
a
prominent
feature
except
for
a
genuinely
pumpkinlike
bitterness
and
slightly
herbaceous
finish
after
the
swallow
overall
this
beer
is
not
nearly
as
much
of
a
spice
bomb
as
other
pumpkin
ales
and
deserves
credit
for
delivering
a
lot
of
malt
character
and
body
o
this
beer
was
great
except
for
the
flavor
which
was
a
bit
underwhelming
for
a
pumpkin
ale
too
bad
overall
way
better
pumpkins
out
there
river
horse
smuttynose
etc
o
everyone
always
complains
that
pumpkin
beers
are
more
spice
than
pumpkin
well
this
one
is
definitely
more
pumpkin
while
at
first
i
was
a
little
disappointed
that
it
didnt
have
that
immediate
sweetness
and
spiciness
that
most
pumpkin
ales
tend
to
have
once
i
got
past
that
and
really
started
to
focus
on
what
this
beer
actually
was
i
could
appreciate
what
wolavers
had
created
and
that
was
a
true
pumpkin
beer
which
just
happens
to
be
not
all
that
great
when
compared
to
other
styles
for
the
style
its
good
for
a
true
pumpkin
beer
it
might
even
be
a
fantastic
example
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
again
quite
nice
give
it
a
go
i
like
this
one
the
smell
is
really
great
and
the
taste
delivers
beer
first
and
pumpkin
spice
second
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
give
it
an
overall
top
5
for
pumpkin
beers
highly
recommended
if
you
like
anything
with
pumpkin
flavor
overall
ok
could
have
gone
without
the
leftover
yeast
good
brew
other
than
that
one
flaw
sampled
during
an
impromptu
pumpkin
tasting
pours
an
orange
hue
scent
is
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
malt
not
much
pumpkin
character
taste
is
similar
but
not
as
interesting
as
the
nose
mouth
is
light
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
season
so
long
as
the
price
is
right
o
meh
nothing
special
going
on
here
though
certainly
drinkable
wouldnt
buy
again
but
would
not
object
at
all
if
offered
completely
middle
of
the
road
the
cpj
o
a
solid
opener
for
the
fall
season
i
would
and
will
buy
again
overall
respectable
but
thats
as
far
as
it
goes
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
might
get
a
little
touchy
after
a
couple
the
addition
of
real
pumpkin
and
the
resulting
flavor
is
a
nice
touch
pours
a
slightlyhazed
orange
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
and
some
slight
lacing
the
nose
carries
a
bit
of
pumpkin
and
spice
mostly
cinnamon
and
clove
the
flavor
is
fairly
heavy
on
the
spice
with
quite
a
bit
of
cinnamon
feel
is
overwhelmingly
full
of
cinnamon
and
a
bit
of
clove
medium
body
with
light
sweetness
not
a
fan
at
all
overall
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
next
to
thirsty
dog
i
had
and
its
cheaper
which
is
sweet
still
as
always
i
need
more
spice
o
will
look
forward
to
this
every
year
my
initial
impression
was
that
this
surpasses
the
consensus
b
it
has
received
but
about
halfway
through
the
bottle
i
got
sick
of
the
fake
pumpkin
flavor
and
more
or
less
agree
with
the
crowd
on
this
one
all
in
all
not
impressed
with
this
one
d
not
a
bad
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
fall
afternoon
a
pleasant
enough
beer
just
not
remarkable
in
any
way
when
i
had
this
in
a
large
pumpkin
beer
tasting
i
hosted
i
do
remember
it
seeming
somewhat
simple
and
the
metallic
taste
coming
out
a
bit
more
i
could
drink
this
on
a
fall
night
and
enjoy
quite
a
few
of
them
reasonable
pricing
unlike
most
organic
foods
this
was
9tax
for
a
sixer
not
bad
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
also
is
not
all
that
much
to
it
tasted
like
a
fairly
simple
beer
drinkability
is
ok
but
not
the
greatest
drinking
well
for
abv
and
smooth
lighter
body
but
the
spices
and
diacetyl
linger
a
bit
too
much
too
light
body
medium
carbing
i
could
only
drink
two
of
these
during
a
sitting
pours
a
amber
orange
color
with
moderate
plume
of
white
head
scent
is
mild
with
hints
of
light
carmel
malts
and
pumkin
pie
spices
taste
brings
the
tastes
of
a
light
brown
ale
modest
amounts
of
spicing
and
a
somewhat
soapy
like
quality
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
very
fizzy
carbonation
a
lower
quality
pumpkin
ale
with
muddled
flavor
profile
and
some
off
notes
pumpkin
beers
seem
to
fall
into
two
categories
those
that
taste
like
pumpkin
and
those
that
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
this
one
falls
somewhere
in
between
leaning
a
little
more
towards
pumpkin
pie
with
its
spiciness
cinnamon
dominates
and
some
other
spices
like
nutmeg
mingle
with
the
actual
pumpkin
flavor
this
one
is
a
little
underrated
with
the
ba
community
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
ale
that
has
an
incredible
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
not
to
mention
its
organic
which
is
always
a
plus
check
it
out
if
you
see
it
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
could
definitely
use
some
more
balance
in
all
areas
some
more
head
would
be
nice
the
flavor
and
smell
are
a
bit
too
cinnamonheavy
and
the
mouthfeel
yields
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
still
this
isnt
anything
to
really
complain
about
and
has
its
place
in
the
fall
d
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
but
doesnt
quite
match
up
to
some
of
the
other
types
of
pumpkin
ales
overall
not
a
pleasant
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
little
spice
and
no
pumpkin
to
be
found
this
is
the
worst
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
definitely
dont
reccomend
the
spices
arent
overwhelming
and
the
dryness
makes
for
a
drinkable
brew
however
we
like
a
bit
more
meat
in
our
pumpkin
ales
and
by
that
we
mean
wed
like
more
of
the
pumpkin
flavor
pulling
throughthis
is
a
pumpkin
beer
after
allalong
with
a
bit
more
of
malty
backbone
to
provide
some
more
depth
character
and
balancing
sweetness
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
ever
had
but
worth
trying
like
i
said
some
good
not
notsogood
the
flaws
are
fairly
minor
though
overall
this
is
tasty
enough
to
that
i
would
be
happy
putting
away
a
few
if
there
were
no
alternative
this
is
one
of
the
most
pumpkiney
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
its
sweet
and
spicy
with
strong
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
flavors
it
isnt
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
it
has
the
big
flavor
that
i
feel
pumpkin
ales
should
have
this
might
just
be

i
know
the
sweeter
pumpkin
pie
type
fall
ales
arent
for
everyone
but
if
your
on
the
hunt
for
a
fall
seasonal
this
is
a
must
no
matter
what
overall
a
very
tasty
pumpkin
ale
go
grab
a
case
if
you
can
d
good
not
sickening
taste
solid
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
in
my
opinion
and
while
there
are
better
versions
out
there
it
is
worth
a
try
light
well
balanced
and
flavorful
they
have
corrected
the
sour
taste
it
had
last
year
too
t
kind
of
a
tart
pumpkin
taste
its
got
some
bold
cinnamon
in
there
the
spice
is
strong
its
a
solid
effort
youll
like
it
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
but
not
one
of
the
best
clear
honey
colored
brew
with
1
finger
of
dense
eggshell
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
behind
aromas
of
cinnamon
and
clove
spiciness
orange
and
lemon
citrus
thick
with
light
and
medium
colored
malts
in
a
blind
smell
test
i
would
call
this
distinctly
belgian
taste
is
disappointingly
empty
muted
spice
and
citrus
notes
malts
also
very
faint
some
spiciness
lingers
in
the
finish
hugely
lacking
on
the
palate
carbonation
is
a
little
too
robust
mouthfeel
is
moderate
in
thickness
not
exciting
to
drink
due
to
lack
of
taste
d
a
well
crafted
pumpkin
brew
id
drink
another
poured
a
clear
orange
color
into
an
american
pint
glass
with
one
finger
of
bright
white
head
that
didnt
lace
at
all
the
aroma
was
one
of
pronounced
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
reminded
me
of
warm
pumpkin
pie
however
the
flavor
tasted
like
a
watereddown
version
of
the
smell
however
the
texture
did
mitigate
the
lack
of
flavor
the
medium
body
was
creamier
and
more
smooth
than
expected
i
definitely
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
sessioning
this
but
there
are
better
examples
of
pumpkin
ale
out
there
not
too
bad
of
a
pumpkin
beer
though
hardly
the
best
on
the
market
d
easily
drinkable
solid
pumpkin
ale
not
the
best
ive
had
but
far
from
the
worst
this
beer
gets
bonus
points
for
being
organic
i
believe
its
the
first
organic
beer
ive
ever
had
overall
im
running
out
of
patience
with
these
pumpkin
beers
im
glad
i
dont
have
many
left
for
the
season
fairly
easy
drinking
and
i
like
the
fact
that
it
is
organic
being
a
dirty
hippie
and
all
not
bad
12oz
bottle
not
my
favorite
wolavers
product
too
much
spice
and
not
enough
body
not
balanced
and
thin
im
not
sure
that
i
expected
from
this
one
orgainic
pumpkin
for
one
but
wolavers
being
so
expensive
i
thought
id
be
getting
something
better
this
is
the
worst
pumpkin
ive
had
even
worse
than
shipyards
yawnboring
pumpkin
that
everyone
loves
i
really
liked
this
beer
nice
orange
amber
color
with
descent
lacing
not
much
of
a
head
the
aroma
of
pumpkin
and
real
pumpkin
not
spice
is
very
present
and
pumpkin
is
the
primary
flavor
nice
hint
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
without
being
overwhelming
a
real
good
example
of
a
pumpkin
brew
d
a
drinkable
beer
likely
due
to
the
lightness
of
it
overall
have
had
better
beers
in
the
pumpkin
ale
category
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
several
other
pumpkinflavored
beers
that
i
would
pick
first
drinkability
not
particularly
impressive
as
it
only
hints
at
what
a
pumpkin
ale
should
be
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
clean
and
lightly
carbonated
very
easy
to
drink
very
cool
that
it
is
organic
too
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
think
i
would
actually
maybe
on
tap
with
a
nice
meal
its
very
easy
drinking
and
could
go
quite
well
with
a
turkey
dinner
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
with
a
one
half
finger
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly

of

lead
to
a
carmelized

with

fades

there
is

to
the
spices
in
this
beer
high
drinkability
because
the
spices
fade
out
with
a
malty
pumpkin
finish
notes
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
year
old
bottle
of
pumpkin
ale
this
probably
is
not
a
style
known
for
ageing
but
it
was
still
quite
good
the
organic
pumpkin
flavor
was
very
nice
and
noticeable
with
a
good
balance
of
spice
hops
and
malt
a
solid
session
pumpkin
ale
great
for
the
fall
months
bought
a
six
pack
for
the
season
beautiful
appearance
of
a
clear
burnt
pumpkin
orange
color
a
thin
head
and
some
patchy
lacing
on
the
sides
add
to
the
look
really
nice
autumnal
aromas
of
spice
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
really
sweet
taste
with
tons
of
sugars
vanilla
hops
nicely
crisp
and
a

makes
it
a
nice

very
good

my
go

gold
it
also
shows
that
pumpkin
can
be
used
tastefully
in
a
brew
without
tasting
like
a
silly
dessert
it
definitely
sticks
out
among
the
other
pumpkin
beers
brewed
this
time
of
year
overall
im
happy
i
got
to
have
a
pumpkin
beer
but
id
want
to
go
an
try
some
other
pumpkins
before
i
go
back
to
this
one
explore
my
horizons
love
this
time
of
year
when
the
pupkin
brews
start
arriving
on
store
shelves
this
poured
into
a
nocic
a
dull
deep
goldenamber
with
a
thinner
but
well
maintaned
frothy
white
headlight
spice
aromas
in
the
nose
mainly
thin
near
watery
mouthfeel
with
no
full
richness
that
i
like
in
a
good
pumpkin
brewflavors
are
dominate
by
spice
and
no
pumpkin
really
although
its
not
horrible
the
flavors
are
to
light
along
with
the
body
in
my
opinion
to
me
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
it
tastes
like
spiced
pumpkin
and
it
tastes
like
ale
i
dont
know
if
the
spiced
beers
can
ever
be
overly
drinkable
but
besides
the
dry
lingering
hop
presence
i
could
easily
savor
a
bottle
overall
im
glad
to
see
that
wolavers
gets
some
good
pumpkin
flavor
in
there
since
a
lot
of
pumpkin
beers
seem
to
be
lacking
pumpkin
flavor
might
be
too
spice
laden
for
some
but
the
spices
remind
me
of
fall
so
i
dont
mind
also
this
is
an
organic
beer
so
if
thats
your
thing
i
would
definitely
check
it
out
otherwise
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
there
are
better
ones
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
pours
a
clear
bright
orange
color
with
a
slight
off
white
color
head
that
is
slight
in
size
the
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
malts
the
taste
is
a
little
off
the
pumpkin
taste
is
very
slight
and
there
is
also
a
little
nutmeg
present
however
the
taste
is
watery
and
not
what
you
would
expect
the
mouthfeel
is
of
moderate
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
the
flavor
leaves
you
wanting
more
it
just
doesnt
deliver
in
taste
everything
else
about
it
is
nice
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
it
was
one
of
the
few
where
i
could
actually
tell
there
was
pumpkin
present
bottled
on
81209
the
beer
was
an
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
pumpkin
and
spice
aroma
pumpkin
taste
with
some
clove
and
cinnamon
the
beer
had
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
i
enjoyed
it
for
all
its
aromatic
grandstanding
however
this
ale
sits
a
bit
flaccid
on
the
tongue
its
malt
foundation
first
hits
the
tongue
then
a
delicious
and
fleeting
onetwo
punch
of
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
what
follows
is
a
crisp
sour
flowery
hop
finish
light
spicy
but
somewhat
unexciting
this
is
a
reasonable
session
beer
thin
but
smooth
at
first
with
acidity
and
astringency
later
on
fizzy
but
moderate
carbonation
it
was
decididly
acidic
a
fact
that
didnt
sit
too
well
in
the
rest
of
the
mix
but
overall
totally
earthy
and
completly
delicious
body
is
thin
amply
carbonated
maybe
a
bit
on
the
low
side
quite
drinkable
reminds
me
more
of
a
lager
than
an
ale
im
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
but
this
one
goes
towards
the
bottom
of
the
list
wolavers
will
stevens
pumpkin
ale
is
not
one
of
this
brewerys
better
offerings
bitter
and
sour
both
have
their
places
but
not
in
a
pumpkin
ale
they
dont
recommendation
major
overhaul
d
for
a
spice
beer
was
fairly
easy
to
enjoy
and
down
sweet
dry
with
a
warm
pumpkin
and
malty
nature
makes
this
worthy
of
checking
out
interesting
to
say
the
least
i
understand
that
uncharacteristic
for
a
pumpkin
ale
tartness
in
the
profiles
is
courtesy
of
the
type
of
pumpkins
that
were
used
but
unfortunately
i
just
couldnt
get
into
it
kudos
to
otter
creek
for
going
organic
with
this
one
but
theres
better
out
there
right
now
not
a
good
pumpkin
ale
likes
nice
smell
is
okay
until
tasted
weak
and
sour
with
pumpkin
coming
across
in
a
way
that
some
fruit
beers
with
a
somewhat
artificial
sweetness
do
not
good
not
easy
to
drink
not
recommended
would
drink
again
if
you
like
sour
beers
give
this
a
try
not
me
thanks
strong
flavors
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
more
tart
and
sour
than
i
would
have
expected
good
brew
just
wouldnt
want
a
lot
of
them
tried
this
on
tap
at
big
city
in
allston
this
past
weekend
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
bright
orange
color
no
head
lots
of
carbonation
though
smelled
like
a
possible
winner
as
i
like
the
cinnamon
smell
to
it
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
while
i
could
taste
the
pumpkin
it
tasted
a
bit
off
almost
too
fake
like
it
was
added
in
after
and
there
was
a
strange
metallic
offflavor
in
the
back
of
my
throat
that
i
could
not
shake
loose
my
wife
who
is
a
pumpkin
ale
fiend
agreed
that
this
one
was
not
that
good
i
drank
it
but
i
wish
i
had
ordered
something
different
probably
the
first
wolavers
that
ive
had
and
didnt
like
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
the
only
turnoffs
were
the
inexplicable
tangy
and
tart
flavors
perhaps
from
the
pumpkin
but
probably
not
and
the
overreliance
on
ginger
definitely
worth
a
try
however
and
as
an
added
bonus
its
organic

well
overall
a
disappointment
gotta
be
honest
wasnt
sold
on
first
taste
but
as
i
sat
and
relaxed
this
beer
really
caught
my
fancy
this
is
an
honest
beer
with
a
medium
body
that
is
great
for
an
autumn
night
bender
factor
i
suspect
that
this
is
what
pumpkin
ale
is
actually
supposed
to
taste
like
instead
of
a
pumkin

like
vanilla

on

i

2
and

fully
appreciate
it
take
the
time
to
truly
appreciate
it
very
light
bodied
with
an
over
abundant
level
of
carbonation
it
finishes
well
a
mess
oh
well
i
can
not
finish
the
glass
d
very
drinkable
especially
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
the
flavors
and
the
feel
blend
really
well

drinkable
this
is
a
nice
little
brew
d
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
like
the
fact
that
they
went
organic
and
worked
with
the
pumpkins
of
a
local
vermont
farmer
in
the
end
i
enjoyed
it
and
so
far
one
of
my
favourite
pumpkin
brews
but
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
actual
pumpkin
flavour
i
would
have
liked
to
see
the
organic
pumpkins
show
their
stuff
more
so
to
speak
pours
a
semihazy
amber
color
with
coppery
syrup
falling
down
2
fingers
of
foamy
cream
colored
head
has
good
retention
and
leaves
some

smells
of
cinnamon
brown
sugar
light
malt
and
some
citrus
rind
tastes
of
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
lots
of
nutmeg
up
front
then
some
light
grainy
malts
and
an
odd
sour
lemon
and
strong
ginger
finish
medium
to
medium
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
a
mix
of
watery
and
syrupy
very
spiced
out
with
a
sour
finish
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
pumpkin
or
maltiness
not
a
pumpkin
ale
that
ill
be
picking
up
again
anytime
soon
it
was
definitely
hard
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
with
the
amount
of
ginger
lingering
after
each
sip
d
a
very
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
i
definitely
could
not
drink
more
than
one
of
these
a
night
and
highly
doubt
i
will
ever
buy
a
sixer
of
this
again
having
said
that
the
beer
isnt
totally
bad
its
just
not
my
type
of
beer
interesting
to
say
the
least
pours
a
slightly
clouded
amber
brown
with
a
creme
head
the
spices
grabbed
my
nose
as
i
was
pouring
and
i
didnt
like
perfumed
clove
is
dominant
bleh
flavor
carries
the
same
way
too
much
man
too
much
spices
no
evident
pumpkin
feel
is
eh
who
cares
i
cant
drink
this
pours
a
typical
amberorange
body
very
hazy
which
is
fine
not
much
head
not
much
lacing
theres
an
odd
tart
note
to
this
beer
that
i
initially
found
offputting
right
out
of
the
fridge
but
which
i
then
came
to
enjoy
as
it
warmed
a
bit
its
unique
most
pumpkin
beers
tend
to
have
a
sweet
malty
base
and
some
over
do
it
of
course
thats
true
for
the
spice
as
well
and
i
think
this
almost
falls
into
that
category
its
not
so
heavy
handed
that
it
builds
on
the
palate
or
anything
but
it
is
spicy
apart
from
that
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
head
retention
is
limited
but
thats
probably
due
at
least
in
part
to
the
spicing
lots
of
ginger
a
healthy
dose
of
cinnamon
seemingly
allspice
i
question
where
that
tartness
is
coming
from
though
is
it
just
the
ph
of
the
brew
probably
not
is
it
the
heavy
use
of
ginger
could
be
its
slightly
thin
as
well
and
perhaps
that
has
something
to
do
with
it
i
dunno
in
any
case
its
a
little
quirky
but
i
kind
of
like
it
this
is
overpowered
by
ginger
fallowed
by
an
obnoxious
wave
of
cinimmon
the
pumpkin
was
slightly
present
but
was
bland
and
lost
in
the
great
wave
of
spice
this
is
by
far
the
worst
pumpkin
ale
that
i
have
ever
had
this
is
also
the
first
drain
pour
that
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
you
should
never
try
this
one
ever
pours
a
reddish
body
with
a
good
onefinger
head
that
stays
around
a
little
bit
thin
smell
of
faint
caramel
malt
and
spices
little
hops
a
little
funky
with
the
amount
of
sourness
in
this
beer
retains
some
malty
taste
along
with
pumpkin
spice
but
not
a
great
beer
also
a
little
thinnish
for
me
i
prefer
my
pumpkin
ales
heavy
with
the
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
flaovr
this
isnt
one
of
them
this
beer
went
from
a
lot
of
potential
to
not
much
in
a
short
amount
of
time
as
i
poured
it
the
whole
room
began
to
smell
like
a
fresh
baked
pumpkin
pie
fantastic
aroma
appearance
wise
its
a
hazy
golden
pumpkin
color
beautiful
taste
wise
is
where
it
begins
to
falter
up
front
its
good
with
some
nice
fall
spices
to
go
along
with
some
spices
but
then
this
very
sour
aftertaste
is
felt
after
the
initial
hit
on
the
palette
this
sourness
is
overwhelming
and
kills
what
could
have
been
a
great
beer
tough
to
drink
after
that
another
disappointing
pumpkin
beer
i
had
such
high
hopes
this
beer
had
a
great
pumpkin
pie
smell
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
not
too
much
spice
which
tends
to
happen
sometimes
like
with
the
pumking
from
southern
tier
still
think
its
great
though
it
has
a
good
pumpkin
flavor
too
this
beer
has
an
amazing
nose
a
real
winner
in
the
pumpkin
category
big
wolavers
fan
had
to
try
this
one
i
really
dig
the
whole
grown
local
brewed
local
concept
sadly
the
beer
didnt
deliver
as
well
as
it
could
pours
a
solid
amber
nice
white
head
the
smell
isnt
overpowering
but
the
spice
notes
are
definitly
present
the
initial
taste
as
others
have
said
is
a
mouthful
of
pumpkin
but
watered
down
kind
of
the
tartness
is
what
suprised
me
most
not
exactly
what
i
expected
but
at
the
same
time
very
drinkable
and
not
overpowering
i
almost
like
it
more
than
other
pumpkin
ales
that
are
so
in
your
face
with
flavor
that
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
is
impossible
this
one
is
almost
dare
i
say
sessionable
not
something
id
run
uphill
barefoot
in
a
snowstorm
to
get
but
fair
enough
d
drinks
quick
with
its
light
watery
flavor
could
be
better
with
more
beer
ingredients
dnot
very
good
at
all
the
flavours
are
mild
and
what
there
is
dissipates
quickly
really
not
what
i
was
looking
for
as
an
after
dinner
pumpkin
beer
i
really
should
just
stick
with
dfh
pumpkin
and
st
pumpking
when
i
have
the
urge
for
the
style
pours
a
three
finger
beige
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
nearly
clear
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
pumpkin
nose
flavor
is
pumpkin
and
some
citrus
hints
of
a
bitter
finish

store

vt
well
as
a
longtime
fan
and
consumer
of
wolavers
and
otter
creek
i
must
admit
that
i
am
a
little
bit
disappointed
with
this
attempt
i
love
the
concept
of
a
locally
and
organically
brewed
and
grown
beer
and
i
really
do
enjoy
pumpkin
ales
especially
this
time
of
year
that
said
this
version
falls
short
of
wolavers
typical
standards
the
beer
does
pour
nicely
with
a
palewhite
head
and
the
color
is
a
wonderful
and
appropriate
shade
of
amber
the
nose
is
nice
as
well
cinnamon
cloves
and
the
usual
suspects
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
not
in
a
cloying
sort
of
way
the
taste
however
is
where
this
offering
falls
short
after
an
initial
mouth
full
of
pumpkin
the
taste
quickly
turns
tartsour
detracting
from
the
overall
enjoyment
and
quickly
banishing
from
your
mind
and
your
taste
buds
the
initial
flavors
this
is
not
a
horrible
beer
but
unless
the
sourness
is
cleaned
up
i
do
not
think
i
would
get
this
again
wolavers
oatmeal
stout
however
is
a
different
story
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pumpkincooper
color
with
an
average
white
head
that
settled
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
allspice
and
nutmeg
more
of
an
earthy
or
powdery
scent
the
taste
hits
with
a
strong
pumpkin
and
grain
flavor
followed
by
a
lemony
tart
and
some
light
nutmeg
and
allspice
some
earthy
hop
flavors
round
out
the
brew
definitely
used
real
pumpkin
with
this
one
has
an
odd
sweetness
probably
from
the
pumpkin
and
grain
perhaps
it
could
have
used
more
body
the
feel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
sweet
and
spicy
yet
good
balance
the
brew
is
definitely
takes
on
more
of
a
pumpkin
flavor
than
pumpkin
pie
some
odd
flavors
but
overall
quite
solid
nice
earthy
autumn
time
brew
drinkability
a
very
wild
and
weird
yet
solid
pumpkin
ale
i
can
see
how
people
may
not
like
this
but
i
like
it
a
lot
and
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
bitter
and
balanced
and
weird
if
youre
down
for
that
then
certainly
try
it
but
as
far
as
a
normal
version
of
the
style
this
isnt
it
hazy
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
pleasing
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
pie
crust
here
is
why
people
are
trashing
this
beer
a
burst
of
cinnamon
on
the
flavor
quickly
turns
sour
with
metallic
notes
and
dill
pickle
ouch
medium
body
and
more
cinnamon
and
sourness
on
the
finish
something
went
wrong
i
hope
they
fix
it
next
year
because
this
is
their
first
try
on
this
please
dont
make
me
wish
i
had
an
ab
pumpkin
beer
instead
of
this
one
with
so
many
pumpkin
beers
out
these
days
its
time
to
thin
the
heard
i
dont
see
why
a
lot
of
people
are
trashing
this
beer
burnt
orange
with
an
off
white
head
that
holds
pretty
well
and
leaves
nice
lace
nose
is
pumpkin
spice
cinnamon
ginger
clove
and
brown
sugar
tastes
relatively
well
balanced
with
a
lemony
kick
from
hops
i
assume
smooth
medium
body
with
a
spicy
finish
that
lasts
sort
of
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
its
not
a
dipa
and
i
think
people
are
forgetting
that
they
are
reviewing
a
pumpkin
beer
good
effort
from
a
conscious
and
economic
brewer
well
its
that
time
of
year
againthis
one
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
decent
retention
and
a
very
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
spice
body
is
medium
with
carbonation
taste
is
pumpkin
pie
all
the
way
spicey
with
some
bready
undertones
very
nice
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
by
any
means
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
however
unfortunately
a
light
bitter
ale
with
the
classic
pumkin
spices
watery
in
mouthfeel
with
an
overdone
all
spice
still
not
bad
and
better
than
many
of
the
unimaginitive
pumpkin
beers
can
we
get
more
alpine
brewing
southern
tier
midnight
sun
and
dogfish
pumpkin
beers
out
there
the
base
is
what
is
what
its
all
about
this
ale
has
a
warming
effect
to
it
and
i
dont
think
it
can
be
attributed
to
the
alcohol
as
i
would
guess
it
is
quite
moderate
the
pumpkin
and
spicing
just
gives
you
that
warm
feeling
of
late
summerearly
fall
and
the
harvest
season
in
the
northeast
drinking
pumpkin
ales
fresh
is
key
in
my
opinion
and
this
one
right
now
is
very
fresh
and
tasty
although
not
one
of
my
more
favorite
styles
pumpkin
ales
are
always
fun
to
visit
in
septemberoctober
to
complement
the
colorful
leaves
and
chilly
air
and
wolavers
rendition
has
not
disappointed
d
a
nice
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
makes
this
beer
pretty
drinkable
def
have
to
let
it
warm
up
some
i
think
to
get
the
full
taste
out
of
it
and
probably
could
only
have
1
or
2
of
these
d
id
recommend
trying
this
beer
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
it
was
worth
trying
i
bought
it
as
a
single
just
in
case
but
i
could
drink
a
few
more
but
i
would
probably
mix
one
with
something
maltier
just
to
see
what
it
was
like
overall
very
enjoyable
im
not
a
fan
of
pumpkin
by
any
means
except
when
its
in
beer
this
may
be
my
goto
fall
beer
this
year
this
is
a
pretty
lousy
pumpkin
ale
as
far
as
the
style
goes
it
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
and
retention
the
aroma
is
unmistakably
pumpkin
some
nutmeg
some
spices
some
maltiness
in
there
too
the
taste
is
quite
imbalanced
there
is
a
definite
pumpkin
flavor
but
it
is
compromised
by
the
strong
nutmeg
rind
and
sharp
spices
the
pumpkin
flavor
should
be
sweet
and
it
is
just
sitting
on
top
of
a
raw
bitterness
this
is
an
unpleasant
brew
from
an
otherwise
decent
brewery
bought
a
lone
bottle
from
city
markup
on
a
whim
poured
out
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
leaning
towards
the
honey
side
three
finger
head
of
tan
with
orange
highlighted
foam
aromas
of
pumpkin
allspice
and
nutmeg
with
some
subtle
malt
behind
that
slightly
sour
at
first
and
a
little
off
reminds
me
of
a
beer
that
has
been
lightfed
the
pumpkin
is
there
but
its
not
very
pleasant
because
it
lacks
sweetness
orange
peel
and
nutmeg
are
too
heavy
giving
the
hops
a
bitter
astringent
character
laces
quite
well
but
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
fizzy
and
thin
gotta
say
after
the
great
way
it
looks
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
drinkability
is
good
on
this
beer
a
good
fall
dinner
with
some
turkey
or
a
more
subtle
meat
would
be
nicely
spiced
up
paired
with
this
brew
however
on
its
own
this
beer
is
a
little
too
powerful
for
me
overall
blah
nothing
spectacular
here
more
sour
citric
fruit
than
pumpkin
1
and
done
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
this
type
of
seasonal
d
a
nice
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
makes
this
beer
pretty
drinkable
while
the
very
strong
clove
taste
got
to
me
a
little
bit
later
overall
the
beer
was
pretty
good
and
definitely
worth
at
least
a
session
or
two
this
beer
pours
a
nice
orangish
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
recedes
to
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
decent
pumpkin
aroma
that
isnt
overpowered
by
the
spices
the
taste
probides
more
of
the
pumpkin
which
compliments
the
malt
flavor
nicely
the
mouth
feel
is
full
with
adequate
carbonation
the
dry
finish
makes
this
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
next
d
not
too
bad
glad
i
only
got
a
12oz
pour
a
temporary
fix
to
my
pumpkin
ale
problem
but
not
worth
revisiting
the
beer
pours
an
amberorange
color
with
little
head
to
speak
of
that
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
solid
pumpkin
scent
along
with
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spice
aromas
it
appears
dry
but
its
hard
to
tell
with
the
lack
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
very
aggressive
pumpkin
flavor
with
little
in
the
way
of
malt
character
the
spices
are
present
but
weak
comparitively
its
easy
going
down
but
quite
dry
and
astringent
the
mouthfeel
is
nothing
to
speak
of
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
almost
no
carbonation
this
is
a
very
forgettable
brew
if
it
were
well
carbonated
i
may
be
singing
a
different
tune
however
as
it
stands
its
one
an
done
for
me
drinkability
is
not
too
bad
at
first
but
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
though
i
bought
a
six
pack
go
figure
its
almost
too
early
for
a
pumpkin
ale
as
well
do
pick
it
up
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
so
to
recap
this
beer
is
a
nice
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
that
is
well
balanced
and
drinkable
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
little
darker
but
smells
like
a
pumpkin
pie
tastes
like
a
pumpkin
pie
but
with
less
spice
and
more
pumpkin
overall
pretty
pleased
not
as
sweet
as
others
like
shipyards
but
still
mad
good
this
was
a
good
pumpkin
beer
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
again
because
of
the
price
and
there
are
other
good
pumpkin
beers
out
there
which
are
much
cheaper
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
strong
malty
aroma
has
a
good
tone
of
pumpkin
and
more
than
a
hint
of
cloves
pours
a
translucent
russet
with
a
fairly
thick
buff
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
malty
flavor
has
a
firm
but
not
overpowering
note
of
pumpkin
plus
hints
of
cloves
and
cinnamon
and
a
touch
of
hops
texture
has
good
fizz
and
body
a
very
good
beer
for
a
halloween
party
or
for
thanksgiving
dinner

plato
with
a
drier
finish
enjoyed
the
750ml
bottle
no
head
bland
flavor
not
much
better
than
a
runofthemill
average
pumpkin
ale
right
up
there
with
dogfish
o
quite
drinkable
and
doesnt
go
overboard
on
the
spicing
nice
pumpkin
ale
pumpkin
beer
is
one
of
my
favorite
types
of
beer
this
beer
has
the
best
pure
pumpkin
flavor
of
any
of
them
color
is
that
of
pumpkin
pie
very
little
head
smell
is
the
same
as
the
color
taste
is
exceptional
balances
the
sweetness
with
the
spice
doesnt
go
to
heavy
on
spice
exceptional
pumpkin
flavor
love
the
finish
feels
slightly
less
thick
than
the
taste
overall
pure
pumpkin
gold
overall
actually
alot
better
than
most
of
the
other
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
this
is
a
beer
rather
than
a
beer
with
tons
of
spices
thrown
in
to
resemble
an
over
spiced
pie
body
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
for
my
personal
preference
but
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
very
well
put
together
nicely
balanced
pumpkin
ale
that
opts
to
showcase
the
gourd
itself
instead
of
nestling
it
in
a
swaddle
of
spices
that
overwhelm
its
vegetal
simplicity
havent
had
a
nondonutinspired
rogue
beer
in
a
while
so
i
figured
id
stick
with
the
vague
sense
of
the
season
and
try
out
their
pumpkin
ale
it
pours
a
clear
siennaamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandy
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
mild
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
a
twinge
of
dark
greens
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
relatively
heavy
on
the
clove
and
cinnamon
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
at
all
one
that
hits
the
spice
notes
without
burning
the
tongue
with
them
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
pours
a
clear
amber
orange
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
all
pumpkin
and
spices
as
for
taste
this
is
a
very
balanced
ale
with
a
great
pumpkin
flavor
and
just
the
right
amount
of
spices
while
there
are
better
pumpkin
ales
this
is
a
very
good
one
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
pours
a
burnt
orange
with
a
little
red
and
a
nice
beige
head
this
is
the
most
pure
pumpkin
tasting
beer
ive
had
yet
where
elysians
night
owl
pumpkin
ale
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
this
tastes
like
pumpkin
and
i
really
like
it
the
spices
complement
the
pumpkin
subtly
rather
than
overpowering
the
flavor
i
would
rate
this
higher
but
something
about
this
beer
makes
me
not
able
to
drink
a
whole
lot
one
glass
of
this
would
be
perfect
but
750
ml
is
quite
a
bit
for
one
person
that
could
be
me
but
i
think
a
great
beer
makes
me
want
more
than
one
very
smooth
rich
taste
think
pumpkin
pie
really
liked
this
one
pours
a
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
slowly
trails
the
glass
as
it
fizzes
the
smell
is
full
of
pumpkin
and
malt
with
some
very
interesting
spices
the
flavor
was
full
of
pumpkins
in
the
beginning
but
the
addition
of
cardamom
typically
an
indian
spice
gives
this
pumpkin
ale
a
very
unique
taste
profile
that
i
think
works
great
and
gives
a
nice
balancing
spice
to
the
usually
very
sweet
pumpkin
ales
and
the
sweet
orange
bottle
is
a
nice
souvenir
this
ale
is
quite
a
delicious
pumpkin
ale
it
pours
like
a
slice
of
pumpkin
goodness
deep
orange
and
clear
with
a
half
inch
of
head
the
aroma
brings
all
the
warmth
of
fall
the
spices
come
through
marvelously
in
the
smell
the
taste
begins
with
the
sweet
flavor
of
the
pumpkin
then
moves
to
all
those
wonderful
notes
of
spice
the
mouthfell
is
exactly
what
a
pumpkin
ale
the
flavor
of
the
pumpkin
as
well
as
the
spices
linger
for
a
appropriate
amount
of
time
if
you
come
across
this
regardless
of
the
venue
give
it
a
taste
solid
pumpkin
ale
pours
dark
orange
from
draft
with
little
head
that
dissipated
quickly
cloudy
smells
of
spices
with
a
hint
of
cloves
tastes
like
pumpkin
vanilla
all
spice
and
cloves
with
a
little
nutmeg
very
light
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
clean
finish
no
bitterness
better
than
dogfish
head
just
behind
schlafly
and
alewerks
excellent
the
aftertaste
is
very
pleasant
just
a
little
bite
no
booze
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
the
bottle
was
a
lot
cooler
than
the
photo
solid
orange
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
there
is
a
light
pumpkin
spice
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
i
am
glad
i
gave
this
beer
a
try
worth
picking
up
again
750ml
bottle
pours
a
dark
rusty
orange
amber
with
a
small
beige

aroma
is
of
sweet
pumpkin
spices
nutmeg
and
some
malt
taste
same
as
aroma
but
not
overly
sweet
or
cloying
like
other
pumpkin
ales
a
bit
of
cooked
vegetable
flavor
and
mild
caramel

undertones

is

good

very
palatable
brew
finishes
with
sweet
pumpkin
spices
nutmeg
some
cooked
vegetable
notes
mild
caramel
malt
and
some
bitterness
on
the
end
for
balance
could
have
used
a
bit
more
pumpkin
spice
overall
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
and
unassumingly
nicely
balanced
brew
interesting
beer
but
i
cant
say
id
trample
my
mother
to
death
to
get
another
glass
o
it
is
july
it
feels
like
early
october
in
my
mouth
fantastic
i
dont
normally
agree
with
the
rogue
beers
but
this
one
is
heads
and
tails
above
the
rest
truly
a
treat
to
drink
o
pumpkin
is
a
really
hard
beer
to
do
well
and
there
are
many
many
more
misses
than
hits
a
good
pumpkin
ale
i
would
recommend
o
a
nice
toasty
pumpkin
ale
definitely
recommended
for
those
who
like
the
style
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
could
be
just
a
little
thicker
though
o
good
pumpkin
beer
that
is
more
vegetal
than
spicy
overall
this
is
a
nicely
done
pumpkin
ale
spices
stand
out
but
balanced
it
has
a
pretty
unique
character
to
it
overall
a
tasty
easy
drinking
pumpkin
ale
lots
of
spice
and
roastedness
with
a
good
level
of
sweetness
a
rather
enjoyable
drinker
overall
the
sweeter
and
molasses
malts
tend
to
jump
forward
before
the
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
other
pumpkin
spices
do
leaving
them
in
the
dust
but
they
do
catch
up
ultimately
with
a
quick
clean
finish
it
was
not
bad
but
not
one
that
i
would
have
every
year
appearance
is
a
brownish
copper
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
the
nose
has
notes
of
pumpkin
but
also
mild
traces
of
spice
as
well
there
is
also
pumpkin
in
the
flavor
profile
and
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
this
is
a
fullbodied
pumpkin
offering
that
is
solid
but
not
quite
exceptional
subtle
like
adriana
lima
in
a
one
piece
this
one
is
doin
it
right
well
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
decent
head
no
real
lacing
nose
is
pumpkiny
and
fall
spicy
full
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
but
not
sweet
probably
a
good
thing
because
if
it
was
as
sweet
as
the
initial
nose
gave
off
it
would
probably
be
a
little
too
much
anyway
wellbalanced
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
overall
yep
this
is
a
pretty
decent
pumpkin
ale
its
a
style
that
can
be
a
bit
underdone
or
lackadaisical
but
this
has
enough
body
and
oomph
to
push
it
through
to
something
worthwhile
i
liked
it
overall
a
decent
offering
but
nothing
too
special
d
a
very
well
developed
pumpkin
ale
rich
and
robust
rather
quaffable
falls
squarely
in
the
middle
of
the
pumpkin
ale
spectrum
between
spicy
and
cloying
tasty
and
satisfying
the
orange
bottle
is
a
nice
touch
as
well
poured
into
two
pint
glasses
in
my
kitchen
prior
to
seeing
brian
wilsonjeff
beck
show
pumpkin
ales
are
not
my
favorite
but
this
one
is
tolerable
o
wow
this
is
an
excellent
pumpkin
beer
as
you
would
hope
for
from
rogue
not
missing
any
of
the
flavors
you
would
hope
for
just
the
right
amount
of
pumpkin
and
not
overdoing
the
sourness
like
so
many
others
my
only
complaint
really
is
the
carbonation
is
too
high
but
it
certainly
doesnt
detract
from
the
flavor
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
pumpkin
ales
i
would
use
as
a
baseline
to
judge
others
and
would
probably
grab
a
bottle
next
year
as
for
the
complaints
about
the
price
tag
its
a
grow
your
own
bottle
which
means
its
safe
to
assume
using
home
grown
hops
barley
and
pumpkins
might
be
a
little
bit
more
labor
intensive
than
having
it
shipped
to
ones
doorstep
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
bright
orange
red
with
a
half
inch
of
white
that
settles
quickly
smell
is
like
all
pumpkin
beers
cinnamon
pumpkin
clove
brown
sugar
and
apple
sauce
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
no
surprises
blended
well
body
is
medium
especially
for
the
low
abv
could
use
a
little
more
life
not
dry
and
easy
drinking
this
is
solid
but
expensive
for
a
regular
pumpkin
beer
at
9
99
overall
pedestrian
lacks
a
real
pop
to
it
watered
down
huge
disappointment
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
one
much
better
if
the
spices
were
tamed
a
bit
and
take
a
notch
or
two
out
of
the
carbonation
poured
dark
and
smooth
very
thick
head
i
poured
pretty
fast
a
very
robust
spicy
smelling
beer
with
great
pumpkin
flavor
tasted
very
similar
to
the
alewerks
pumpkin
which
i
really
enjoyed
would
definitely
recommend
a
little
pricy
at
10
bucks
for
a
750ml
o
a
nice
wellbalanced
pumpkin
beer
that
doesnt
go
overboard
on
the
pie
spices
seems
bigger
than
5
6
probably
due
to
the
pumpkins
while
still
remaining
easy
to
drink
a
little
pricey
as
usual
with
rogue
but
the
bottle
is
cool
to
show
off
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
and
packs
a
nice
wallop
of
pumpkin
without
cloying
sweetness
nor
veering
totally
into
pumpkin
pie
mode
if
you
are
looking
for
a
pumpkin
ale
thats
not
totally
pied
out
give
it
a
try
i
enjoyed
rogue
farms
pumpkin
patch
ale
45
o
a
great
fall
beer
i
enjoyed
theu
se
of
hops
in
this
pumpkin
beer
most
dont
have
quite
as
much
kick
it
seemed
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
pumpkin
quite
nicely
a
very
unique
flavored
pumpkin
ale
one
of
my
fav
breweries
have
not
had
one
that
i
dont
love
they
are
now
popping
up
all
over
the
place
i
would
love
to
see
more
on
tap
but
as
of
now
have
only
seen
dead
guy
i
figured
living
in
chicago
i
might
see
more
but
no
dice
if
any
one
has
any
info
on
the
bars
that
carry
it
around
my
town
let
me
know
more
complicated
than
expected
and
a
real
pleasure
will
look
for
it
again
i
poured
this
into
a
glass
it
has
dark
cooper
color
body
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
nice
spice
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
taste
is
strong
of
spices
and
has
pumpkin
on
the
back
of
the
tongu
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
overall
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
its
not
over
the
top
like
st
pumking
but
its
also
not
boringthin
like
some
of
the
other
pumpkin
beers
are
my
bottle
was
7
months
old
and
was
still
drinking
very
nicely
a
medium
feel
to
it
with
medium
carbonation
went
down
pretty
smoothly
poured
a
brownish
auburn
with
decent
head
on
top
of
a
bready
subdued
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
aroma
not
really
noticing
much
else
although
a
touch
of
other
sugary
goodness
probably
caramel
it
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
finishes
crisp
and
easy
thanks
to
the
spice
and
decent
hops
and
carbonation
as
for
the
taste
a
good
chunk
of
pumpkin
is
noticeable
but
it
is
not
overpowering
and
thankfully
the
spices
in
here
like
a
touch
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
pepper
balance
the
beer
as
do
some
sweet
and
bready
so
while
not
overly
sweet
or
pumpkiny
it
is
also
not
watery
and
too
spicy
and
almost
no
pumpkin
is
noticeable
as
i
have
found
in
some
other
cheap
pumpkin
ales
not
the
greatest
or
tastiest
pumpkin
ale
but
i
got
my
pumpkin
fix
and
it
was
sweet
enough
to
enjoy
as
a
dessert
beer
and
thats
all
i
ask
the
mouthfeel
is
amazing
nice
and
creamy
and
just
the
perfect
amount
of
c02
o
i
was
expecting
a
ton
of
pumpkin
and
spices
in
my
face
but
what
i
got
was
a
well
executed
amber
ale
with
complimenting
pumpkin
flavors
o
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
especially
considering
i
sat
on
it
for
nearly
3
months
rogue
can
be
a
little
pricey
but
they
always
seem
to
make
solid
beers

aftertaste
is
a

overall
im
finding
this
very
enjoyable
not
the
best
beer
to
bring
out
the
flavor
of
fresh
pumpkin
pie
spices
but
a
great
example
of
a
pumpkin
beer
that
showcases
spice
without
neglecting
gourd
this
ale
hit
the
shelves
later
than
most
which
i
like
something
strange
about
pumpkin
ales
in
july
in
florida
per
rogue
the
later
release
was
due
to
growing
their
own
gyo
pumpkins
and
declining
to
use
canned
pumpkin
this
is
an
attractive
beer
with
hazy
reddish
orange
body
with
creamy
yellow
head
the
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
is
more
subtle
than
other
examples
of
this
style
also
a
plus
the
taste
this
is
i
am
happy
to
report
my
favorite
of
the
years
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
a
bunch
of
them
this
year
well
balanced
but
not
boring
and
no
chemical
off
tastes
i
know
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
variability
in
this
style
from
year
to
year
ie
weyerbacher
was
great
last
year
but
disappointing
this
year
but
hopefully
rogue
will
hit
the
mark
again
in
subsequent
years
final
grade

an

rogues
pumpkin

ale
is
a
fine
specimen
of
this
occasionallyobnoxious
style
everything
is
balanced
perfectly
with
lots
of
spicy
goodness
for
those
who
enjoy
that
aspect
of
the
style
but
never
going
overboard
this
is
not
a

that
will
exhaust
your
palate
the
malty

gourdy
flavours
and
relatively
dense
body
do
their
part
keeping
the
spice
in
check
generating
an
unbelievably
quaffable
spiced
ale
as
much
as
i
love
pumking
i
like
this
stuff
nearly
as
much
although
for
different
reasons
pumpkin
patch
is
obviously
much
lighter
and
nuanced
and
for
that
reason
i
would
suggest
it
as
a
perfect
introductory
pumpkin
ale
for
newbies
interested
in
trying
the
style
i
would
also
highly
recommend
it
to
seasoned
pumpkinloving
bas
who
are
looking
for
a
great

spiced
sipper
cheers
o
pleasing
pumpkin
ale
the
taste
body
and
aroma
are
all
spot
on
though
for
the
price
it
cant
beat
out
some
of
the
local
brews
for
much
cheaper
a
solid
make
from
rogue
none
the
less
o
great
flavor
for
the
style
not
overly
spices
nor
synthetic
and
syrupy
tasting
like
many
are
let
this
beer
warm
up
and
burn
off
a
few
of
the
bubbles
and
youve
got
a
great
evening
sipper
o
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
this
is
full
flavored
not

and
has
real
pumpkin

this
is
the

i

one

the
better
pumpkin
beers
that
i
have
tried
maybe
rogue
needs
to
turn
down
the
spice
a
tad
but
it
is
still
a
good
beer
very
good
for
the
style
its
full
flavored
with
plenty
of
pumpkin
and
rides
the
edge
of
too
spicy
while
maintaining
a
steady
sweetness
like
this
one
alot
overall
its
a
good
beer
just
a

in

takes

very
good
beer
for
the

o
this
is
a
slightly

pumpkin

kind
of
a

its

equivalent
of

to

cooking
greens
feel
free
to
use
this
ale
as
proof
of
the
benefits
of
using
locally
farmed
ingredients
while
this
would
undoubtedly
pair
with
a
number
of
autumn
delicacies
a
bottle
this
size
makes
for
a
satisfying
treat
in
its
own
right
overall
just
what
i
was
expecting
a
well
executed
pumpkin
ale
with
layered
caramel
spice
and
roasted
pumpkin
well
done
certainly
better
than
the
average
pumpkin
beer
the
price
tags
a
bit
hefty
at
10bomber
but
id
certainly
try
it
on
tap
an
evenhanded
approach
to
a
pumpkin
brew
quite
drinkable
not
overly
spiced
a
little
too
boozy
for
a
6
brew
though
alcohol
just
a
little
too
present
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
small
particles
of
sediment
are
seen
floating
around
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
biscuit
earthy
pumpkin
and
some
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
toasty
and
spice
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
nothing
really
sticks
out
but
nothing
is
overdone
either
which
can
be
a
problem
with
some
pumpkin
beers
o
overall
a
tasty
pumpkin
ale
that
is
surprisingly
well
balanced
and
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palette
with
spicing
easily
sessioned
and
well
worth
trying
out
if
youre
a
pumpkin
ale
fan
overall
a
good
pumpkin
ale
nothing
revolutionary
but
tasty
o
very
good
pumpkin
ale
it
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
in
for
a
lowerabv
brew
o
i
really
like
the
bottle
and
the
amount
of
detail
it
explains
as
to
howwhere
its
made
and
its
composition
i
love
the
nose
though
the
flavorsmouthfeel
are
a
bit
unbalanced
towards
the
spicy
side
and
i
wish
it
looked
nicer
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
this
year
though
all
things
considered
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
overall
it
is
a
pretty
average
pumpkin
offering
i
probably
would
not
buy
this
again
despite
its
eye
catching

on

quite
the
nice
pumpkin
beer
even
at
a
point
when
i
was
growing
tired
of
pumpkin
beers
flavourful
and
quite
drinkable
but
due
to
pice
point
and
bottle
size
i
dont
think
me
and
this
beer
will
be
crossing
paths
again

and

notes
toasted

upfront
followed
closely
by
a
vegetal
note
from
the
pumpkin
puree
and
a
melange
of
spices
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
are
more
prominent
than
clove
a
nutty
character
persists
throughout
almost
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
soft
gentle
mouthfeel
the
pumpkin
and
spice
character
is
strong
enough
to
be
easily
noticed
but
restrained
enough
to
allow
the
base
malt
character
of
the
beer
to
shine
through
there
is
some
sweetness
to
it
but
not
a
whole
lot
it
certainly
isnt
pumking
an
extremely
well
balanced
take
on
a
style
that
many
find
either
overpowering
or
underflavored
this
one
finds
the
middle
ground
still
not
loving
the
style
but
this
was
a
valiant
effort
and
you
can
taste
it
not
for
me
but
worth
trying
as
it
really
does
have
some
stellar
points
overall
i
think
these
beer
goes
up
in
the
honor
of
pumpkins
it
isnt
as
strong
as
some
of
the
better
ones
but
it
is
ridiculously
full
of
flavor
i
would
mark
this
maybe
as
my
number
four
when
it
comes
to
pumpkins
which
says
a
lot
drink
up
and
respect
salud
its
pumpkin
its
beer
its
sex
in
your
mouth
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
need
i
say
more
its
not
too
much
of
a
beer
trying
to
be
a
pumpkin
its
not
too
much
a
pumpkin
trying
to
be
a
beer
its
what
i
want
in
a
pumpking
beer
dark
amber
colored
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
aromas
of
malty
pumpkin
and
spice
taste
is
where
this
beer
shines
pumpkin
cinnamon
allspice
flavors
very
balanced
mouthfeel
is
just
right
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
rogue
got
this
right
id
say
trying
this
is
a
must
try
if
you
dig
seasonals
and
of
course
pumpkin
in
beer
thanksgiving
is
today
for
this
tasting
and
i
couldnt
think
of
a
better
time
to
sample
this
style
everything
for
my
liking
was
fine
about
this
brew
and
despite
the
metallic
impression
i
had
at
first
this
sure
is
tasting
good
as
it
warms
well
made
id
enjoy
pumpkin
flavored
beers
even
more
as
a
big
thick
imperial
stout
o
i
liked
this
beer
because
the
taste
was
all
about
the
pumpkins
and
had
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
make
things
more
palatable
and
some
hints
of
spices
to
add
complexity
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
it
was
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
probably
my
new
favorite
pumpkin
beer
although
it
is
a
bit
pricey
overall
this
is
nice
pumpkin
ale
and
perhaps
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
many
but
i
found
the
complexity
and
potency
of
the
ale
to
lack
somewhat
and
the
flavors
as
well
as
the
mouthfeel
to
be
overly
watery
a
measure
or
two
more
of
ingredients
resulting
in
among
other
details
a
higher
abv
would
have
done
this
beer
wonders
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
hints
of
orange
present
and
a
two
finger
slightly
off
white
head
the
head
leaves
some
lines
of
lace
up
and
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
fresh
pumpkin
there
are
also
hints
of
cinnomon
nutmeg
and
all
spice
with
a
slight
hint
of
dark
fruits
the
taste
follows
suit
it
is
slightly
thin
up
front
for
a
second
but
then
gives
you
a
nice
pumpkin
flavor
there
then
hints
of
vanilla
cinnomon
and
others
spices
with
a
hint
of
a
wet
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
pumpkin
beer
it
is
up
there
with
best
in
class
for
this
style
pours
deep
mahoganyamber
with
orange
hues
and
a
white
head
that
settles
out
to
about
1
cm
nose

pumpkin
a
hint
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
some
caramel
brown
sugar
a
little
bit
of
raisin
and
fig
and
a
bit
more
pumpkin
most
pumpkin
ales
smell
mostly
like
spices
but
this
one
really
smells
like
straight
up
pumpkin
the
taste
is
more
spiced
than
the
smell

dogfish
head
punkin
ale
has
always
been
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
but
this
year
two
have
given
it
a
run
for
its
money
epic
imperial
pumpkin
porter
and
this
bad
boy
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
this
every
year
now
i
hope
i
can
get
one
more
this
year
too
rogues
chatoe
line
has
been
pretty
impressive
overall
great
great
pumpkin
ale
in
terms
of
beer
its
no
world
beater
but
its
far
and
away
the
best
pumpkin
brew
ive
tried
to
date
is
it
worth
the
price
probably
not
but
im
of
the
firm
belief
that
very
few
bombers
are
worth
more
than
7
an
alright
pumpkin
ale
but
would
never
buy
this
again
theres
several
better
for
less
money
o
again
this
is
like
a
spiced
pumpkin
oktoberfest
im
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
a
great
fall
time
ale
oa
lighter
pumpkin
ale
and
one
with
decent
flavor
but
not
as
complex
or
concentrated
as
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
e
g
dfh
or
elysian
perhaps
a
little
more
abv
would
help
out
here
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
brown
color
with
some
red
and
orange
hues
to
it
the
head
was
white
and
kept
a
solid
retention
from
start
to
finish
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
the
traditional
spiced
and
earthy
aromas
of
most
pumpkin
ales
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
similar
to
the
nose
its
got
a
good
amount
of
spice
in
there
without
overpowering
the
other
elements
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
to
medium
bodied
similar
to
most
of
rogues
ale
in
my
opinion
the
carbonation
was
good
and
the
beer
was
drinkable
overall
its
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
o
easy
to
drink
as
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
not
too
sweet
and
not
overly
bitter
either
very
enjoyable
with
great
natural
pumpkin
flavors
balanced
with
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
one
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
next
year
o
satisfying
enough
and
for
people
that
are
more
into
the
basic
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
is
great
nice
pumpkin
notes
but
i
still
feel
pumpkin
ale
is
better
with
a
little
additional
sweetness
httpwww

comkajiisbeerreviews
o
this
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
with
tons
of
flavor
i
find
this
to
be
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
would
for
sure
buy
this
again
a
good
but
not
great
pumpkin
ale
the
amber
base
takes
on
too
much
of
a
presence
for
my
liking
and
the
traditional
pumpkin
pie
spices
dont
shine
through
enough
in
the
taste
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
cinnamon
and
a
bit
of
nutmeg
i
also
get
some
other
assorted
spice
notes
as
well
as
some
toffee
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
some
pumpkin
and
carameltoffee
notes
as
well
as
a
good
bit
of
spice
i
get
a
bit
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
clove
notes
with
a
hint
of
allspice
mixed
in
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
pours
an
orangish
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
one
of
the
better
looking
pumpkin
ales
i
have
seen
nose
is
ghordish
cookie
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
spicy
nutmeg
the
taste
opens
up
with
caramel
malts
which
move
into
some
cookie
malt
flavors
a
touch
of
spices
move
in
most
notably
nutmeg
and
close
to
finish
this
off
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
bodied
overall
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
a
nice
balance
of
spice
and
pumpkin
malts
give
it
a
profile
that
so
many
pumpkin
ales
try
to
achieve
overall
an
ok
pumpkin
beer
tastes
like
an
excellent
pumpkin
ale
roasted
almost
lightly
burned
spice
up
front
moving
into
fresher
sugaryer
spice
in
the
middle
more
pielike
with
big
nodes
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
this
segues
gently
into
the
most
pumpkiny
pumpkin
nodes
ive
ever
come
across
in
a
beerits
like
fresh
seasoned
puree
really
great
stuff
the
flavor
ends
with
a
resurgence
of
vanilla
along
with
more
fresh
pumpkin
and
blended
with
an
exceptionally
creamy
body
the
effect
is
quite
similar
to
spritzing
some
readiwhip
on
top
of
a
slice
of
pie
d
one
of
the
better
pumpkins
i
have
tried
o
pretty
tasty
but
also
pretty
run
of
the
mill
doesnt
do
anything
special
but
it
doesnt
do
anything
wrong
either
the
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
smell
its
good
and
tasty
lighter
with
the
pumpkin
and
spices
than
i
hoped
for
but
still
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
a
decently
low
abv
to
make
it
an
easy
drinker
i
like
love
the
gyo
series
by
rogue
this
ones
a
bit
overpriced
but
so
enjoyable
its
almost
worth
it
but
lets
be
honest
this
is
really
a
7
beer
wrapped
up
in
a
12
price
tag
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
the
flavors
are
all
there
that
you
want
without
any
off
putting
notes
d
this
is
a
much
better
than
average
pumpkin
beer
with
a
great
spice
profile
the
malt
gives
the
beer
a
pie
crust
note
that
i
have
only
otherwise
experienced
in
pumking
before
i
dont
want
a
lot
of
it
but
it
is
much
more
drinkable
than
most
you
must
purchase
the
beer
first
and
foremost
to
understand
it
rogue
did
a
great
job
and
i
will
be
trying
more
of
their
beer
shortly
o
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
very
delicious
and
nicely
balanced
thanks

really
great
pumpkin
ale
im
impressed
highly
the
master
brewers
at
rogue
finally
puts
together
a
home
grown
beer
from
home
grown
products
that
lives
up
to
expectations
and
doing
so
in
a
type
of
beer
that
rarely
gets
it
right
overall
holy
crap
rogue
just
may
have
made
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
out
there
overall
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
if
you
like
pumpkin
and
not
pie
spice
nice
balance
and
very
easy
to
drink
id
have
another
over
priced
and
average
overall
overall
a
half
step
above
the
average
pumpkin
ale
though
at
nearly
two
steps
beyond
the
average
pumpkin
ale
in
price
b
bubbly
head
that
doesnt
really
even
lace
feels
like
an
amber
o
not
gimmicky
this
is
what
a
pumpkin
beer
should
taste
like
lively
dark
ruby
red
topped
by
a
frantic
beige
head
that
settles
down
quickly
strong
aroma
that
is
more
fierce
than
satisfying
overspiced
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
ginger
clove
and
subtle
vanilla
flavors
of
cooked
pumpkin
burnt
pie
crust
cinnamon
nutmeg

acidic
vanilla
mild
spicy
hop
presence
towards
the
finish
medium
bodied
with

carbonation
prickly
feeling
i
expect
better
from
rogue
the
beer
could
use
less
emphasis
on
the
spices
and
bring
in
a
heftier
creamier
body
diggin
the
cooked
pumpkins
the
vanilla
and
the
hops
but
the
ginger
and
clove
could
be
tossed
to
the

pricey
at

a

so
i
probably
wouldnt

up
very
often
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
oits
an
okay
pumpkin
ale
i
respect
they
use
their
own
grown
ingredients
its
adds
some
respect
other
than
that
this
is
maybe
just
a
little
better
than
average
i
would
only
put
it
down
a
few
notches
from
punkin
and

for
the

that
means

never
get

d
good
pumpkin
flavor
in
this
but
nothing
else
is
any
better
than
the
ordinary
which
seems
to
be
a
theme
when
it
comes
to
pumpkin
beers
rating
it
against
the
other
pumpkin
beers
available
this
is
right
up
there
what
it
lacks
in
abv
it
makes
up
for
in
flavor
great
balanced
beer
which
is
hard
to
do
with
such
strong
spices
o
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
honestly
i
was
just
expecting
more
of
a
pumpkin
forward
brew
with
the
spices
taking
the
backseat
not
the
other
way
around
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
of
this
fall
for
me
appearance
is
attractive
right
out
of
the
orange
bottle
and
into
a
tulip
its
pale
orangey
brown
in
color
a
little
hazy
and
boasts
an
incredibly
active
tan
head
with
solid
retention
the
nose
screams
pumpkin
ale
tons
of
spice
but
an
interestign
blend
cumin
maybe
not
too
much
cinnamon
and
the
usual
clove
nutmeg
allspice
suspects
the
taste
features
the
pumpkin
itself
more
than
the
nose
its
earthy
and
flavorful
buttery
in
texture
i
appreciate
that
this
is
a
spicy
pumpkin
beer
but
does
not
have
much
sweetness
to
it
that
turns
me
off
to
a
lot
of
these
but
this
one
mixes
pumpkin
and
spice
perfectly
without
an
overdose
of
molasses
brown
sugar
maple
syrup
or
anything
else
great
carbonation
and
a
drinkably
medium
body
a
perfect
fall
beer
really
i
wish
it
was
more
widely
available
as
ive
only
seen
it
in
a
few
shops
around
town
yummy
stuff
o
absolutely
fantastic
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
ever
had
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
pumpkin
amber
with
a
nice
one
finger
light
tan
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
pumpkin
and
pie
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
cloves
flavor
is
dominated
by
pleasant
pie
spices
particularly
cinnamon
light
sweet
malt
and
pumpkin
finishes
a
bit
dry
with
light
hops
pumpkin
flavor
carries
over
only
slightly
into
the
finish
medium
bodied
a
decent
pumpkin
pie
flavor
but
unbalanced
in
favor
of
spicing
could
use
some
more
malt
and
pumpkin
body
enjoyed
it
and
glad
i
tried
it
but
in
the
middle
of
pumpkin
beer
nirvana
great
pumpkin
dark
o
the
moon
and
night
owl
as
well
as
access
to
pumking
and
treat
i
probably
wont
revisit
this
one
the
pour
is
a
slightly
hazed
burnt
orange
color
with
a
white
head
strong
spice
aroma
as
expected
heavy
on
the
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
all
spice
notes
sweet
bread
malt
with
a
bit
of
toffee
and
biscuit
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
spices
a
touch
of
vanilla
to
go
along
with
the
nutmeg
and
all
spice
a
nice
malty
sweetness
and
good
body
to
go
with
it
i
quite
enjoyed
this
pumpkin
patch
ale
poured
a
darker
golden
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
the
smell
was
complex
with
hints
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
the
taste
was
mellow
had
many
notes
of
the
nutmeg
mixing
with
the
pumpkin
was
easier
to
drink
but
was
on
the
lighter
side
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
but
just
a
bit
weak
in
the
overall
flavor
overall
one
of
the
better
of
the
rogue
beers
in
my
opinion
wasnt
sure
of
what
to
make
of
it
especially
the
way
pumpkin
beers
are
treated
but
rogue
did
one
heck
of
gourd
job
with
this
ale
i
will
come
back
to
this
again
when
avaliabe
and
over
some
other
pumpkin
beers
that
line
my
local
beer
shelves
this
beer
poured
an
appropriate
burnt
orange
color
hazy
with
a
soapy
tannish
head
that
receded
to
a
bubbly
ringlet
typical
aroma
of
pumpkin
and
autumn
spices
taste
of
pumpkin
pie
though
pretty
balanced
between
sweet
and
vegetal
with
spicy
hints
of
cinnamon
clove
and
nutmeg
maybe
a
touch
of
vanilla
bean
some
bittering
from
hops
and
pumpkin
skin
in
the
finish
medium
mouthfeel
a
fine
drink
overall
o
this
beer
is
pretty
good
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
sure
it
would
be
something
that
i
felt
i
needed
to
get
my
hands
on
its
definitely
better
than
most
other
pumpkin
beers
out
there
o
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
i
dont
know
why
it
showed
up
in
december
but
im
glad
to
try
another
one
of
the
style
o
i
gotta
say
this
is
probably
the
most
pumpkin
pie
like
flavored
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
the
flavor
profile
is
intensely
pie
like
which
was
great
to
me
but
it
sorta
falls
flat
towards
the
finish
and
gives
off
a
sorta
watered
down
like
flavor
the
mouthfeel
could
be
fuller
as
well
to
me
anyway
all
in
all
though
its
pretty
good
and
i
like
that
its
not
sickeningly
sweet
and
boozy
so
it
makes
for
a
session
pumpkin
ale
i
would
say
give
it
a
try
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
drinkable
somewhat
flavorful
but
not
really
that
great
pretty
well
suited
for
the
first
day
of
december
like
many
rogue
brews
its
not
cheap
and
that
may
be
the
only
thing
preventing
me
from
buying
another
overall
i
had
the
choice
between
this
and
the
chatoe
pilsner
and
im
glad
i
chose
this
its
a
great
pumpkin
ale
and
i
feel
safe
saying
so
even
though
ive
only
had
a
few
others
most
interesting
to
me
is
that
they
grow
all
the
ingredients
in
this
brew
on
location
at
their
farm
i
actually
do
feel
i
get
a
sense
of
location
from
this
beer
it
doesnt
seem
out
of
character
for
an
oregon
beer
at
all
rogue
keep
it
up
cant
wait
to
try
more
chatoe
beers
perfect
today
on
thanksgiving
i
am
thankful
to
live
somewhere
that
lets
me
try
amazing
beers
well
done
rogue
youve
won
me
back
with
this
one
an
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
that
hits
all
the
right
notes
for
the
style
no
flaws
just
tasty
goodness
i
shall
be
stocking
up
while
i
can
overall
this
is
not
a
big
in
your
face
pumpkin
beer
but
if
you
like
something
like
dfh
punkin
this
will
certainly
please
the
palate
overall
a
good
attempt
at
a
pumpkin
ale
by
rogue
could
use
more
pumpkin
to
balance
the
spices
and
strong
hop
flavour
other
than
that
a
decent
brew
worth
trying
a
decent
enough
pumpkin
pieadjacent
ale
all
of
the
associated
ticks
are
duly
nailed
and
recorded
now
for
posterity
i
could
however
stand
just
a
bit
more
or
any
proper
hop
bitterness
spread
around
that
would
help
with
the
whole
beer
vs
dessert
conflict
currently
mucking
up
my
consciousness
some
good
things
to
take
from
this
sampling
i
really
like
the
flavour
as
they
were
a
fresh
take
on
this
style
this
beer
falls
flat
literally
with
its
carbonation
too
agressive
in
front
not
enough
in
the
finale
o
what
i
like
about
this
is
that
neither
the
pumpkin
or
the
spice
angle
dominate
as
is
often
the
case
with
pumpkin
ales
each
have
their
own
moderate
presence
that
works
well
with
the
malty
backbone
a
very
nice
offering
in
this
category

this
beer
is
amazing
favorite
beer
by
far
pumpkinhead
is
really
excellent
for
cooking
especially
in
slow
cooker
recipes
the
flavours
make
for
a
really
nice
touch
in
stews
ive
had
a
lot
of
pumpkin
beer
and
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
try
spicy
ass
pumpkin
amazingness
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
word
word
word
word
word
overall
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
but
not
great
some
ok
flavors
of
pumpkin
and
spice
i
certainly
wont
search
it
out
again
but
if
offered
im
not
turning
it
down
there
are
tons
of
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
if
you
need
to
get
a
pumpkin
beer
from
shipyard
go
for
the
pugsley
smashed
pumpkin
instead
its
a
far
superior
beer
no
just
no
keep
your
squash
out
of
your
beer
good
seasonal
brew
serve
ice
cold
with
the
sugarcinn
gimmick
its
ok
for
a
few
sips
overall
not
a
good
beer
cheers
o
while
this
pumpkin
ale
tastes
quite
great
although
not
pumpkin
tasting
at
all
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
ultimately
prevent
it
from
being
a
solid
brew
sure
if
you
can
get
past
the
look
and
body
and
focus
on
taste
and
aroma
only
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
due
to
the
fact
that
i
think
this
beer
tastes
damn
good
i
dont
mind
suffering
through
a
excuse
my
language
shit
appearance
and
body
while
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
because
of
its
qualities
as
a
whole
i
do
recommend
it
for
its
aroma
and
taste
cinnamon
flavor
is
too
overpowering
this
beer
did
not
settle
well
with
me
it
had
too
much
spice
to
it
and
the
choice
of
spice
did
not
taste
very
good
despite
the
pleasant
odor
great
pumpkin
beer
that
you
can
have
a
few
of
and
not
have
to
much
of
a
buzz
i
hated
giving
this
a
good
rating
but
i
is
commonly
around
in
october
and
was
a
good
change
from
the
hoppy
stuff
it
was
complex
with
cinnamon
and
maybe
orange
overall
pass
hard
pass
pouring
an
orange
gold
shipyard
pumpkinhead
gives
off
a
heavy
head
of
cinnamon
smells
the
other
pie
spices
are
more
subdued
with
a
whisp
of
vanilla
or
graham
cracker
it
starts
sweet
and
smooth
but
transitions
to
a
higher
carbonation
and
a
watery
body
in
short
order
the
flavors
are
pretty
much
based
in
cinnamon
but
theres
a
touch
of
pumpkin
hints
of
other
spices
and
a
little
bitterness
to
the
gourd
like
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
super
short
just
a
touch
squashy
a
hint
of
honey
and
cinnamon
i
really
like
this
brew
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
o
middleoftheroad
pumpkin
ale
overall
if
you
really
like
a
pumpkin
taste
this
beer
is
for
you
it
has
taste
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
sweet
and
of
course
pumpkin
good
fall
beer
especially
if
you
want
a
pumpkin
fix
found
this
on
sale
at
the
local
distributor
on
halloween
12
oz
cans
real
harrible
just
terrible
i
rate
this
one
closer
to
tops
do
not
know
why
i
have
had
24
pumpkin
beers
this
year
and
that
number
is
going
up
each
days
shipyard
smashed
pumpkins
is
better
but
it
costs
so
much
more
that
i
cannot
say
it
is
better
all
beer
should
be
rated
on
a
cost
to
ounce
scale
and
that
is
how
i
come
to
saying
you
bros
are
so
wrong
on
this
one
but
so
right
on
many
other
styles
i
want
pumpkin
pie
in
my
pumpkin
beers
and
i
get
this
solidly
in
this
and
you
guys
can
eat
your
pumpking
ratings
because
you
rate
on
cool
factors
and
pumpking
is
a
pumpkin
beer
with
little
spice
and
a
high
alcohol
rating
and
price
shipyard
only
follows
ofallon
pumpkin
in
my
book
and
if
you
count
the
years
i
went
pumpkin
you
can
say
i
am
rating
on
60
although
i
am
new
to
this
site
pumpking
is
pumpkin
pulp
ipa
and
lame
on
seasoning
at
least
this
beer
has
it
and
is
a
six
pack
for
a
22
oz
bottle
of
the
smashed
pumpkin
which
wins
in
my
book
over
pumpking
kings
are
dead
and
the
prime
ministers
and
presidents
rule
and
i
will
go
with
this
beer
over
it
any
day
and
ofallon
is
my
pumpkin
beer
king
if
price
matters
not
alcohol
content
o
meh
it
isnt
that
offensive
think
of
it
as
the
bud
light
lime
of
pumpkin
beers
way
too
flowery
couldnt
finish
a
bottle
o
i
actually
really
enjoy
this
beer
its
like
a
pumpkin
spice
hard
cider
not
what
i
expected
from
the
warmer
malty
and
heavy
pumpkins
im
accustomed
to
i
appreciate
how
refreshing
and
light
this
pumpkin
ale
is
im
surprised
by
the
69
ba
rating
and
angry
about
the
bros
41
score
without
being
prejudiced
by
the
label
or
description
pumpkinhead
simply
delivers
a
great
tasting
and
refreshing
product
in
this
category
and
unlike
the
more
expensive
pumple
drumkin
11
for
6
this
one
is
inexpensive
widely
available
and
tastes
like
what
it
says
it
tastes
like
i
look
forward
to
this
one
each
fall
its
ok
terrible
enough
said
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
fall
2013
and
wasnt
a
huge
fan
it
tasted
a
bit
artificial
and
overly
spiced
compared
to
some
of
the
other
spiced
pumpkin
ales
that
i
tried
however
i
bought
another
6
pack
a
few
weeks
ago
in
spirit
of
the
season
to
find
that
it
tasted
much
better
not
sure
if
they
lowered
the
amount
of
spice
or
not
but
it
came
out
nicely
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
hazy
colored
head
tastes
of
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
with
a
splash
of
nutmeg
combines
really
well
with
cider
and
other
spiced
liquors
for
when
youre
sitting
around
a
fire
just
about
any
other
pumpkin
ale
would
be
a
better
choice
but
not
mine
aroma
and
look
there
but
not
taste
good
beer
good
pumpkin
taste
with
a
slight
nutmeg
taste
overall
a
thinner
crisper
pumpkin
ale
not
my
preference
but
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
if
you
are
reading
the
description
when
you
purchase
the
beer
then
you
should
expect
a
lighter
subtle
pumpkin
beer
the
beer
tasted
how
it
was
described
it
was
great
for
a
sunny
fall
day
a
great
transition
from
summer
beers
to
something
more
intense
surprised
this
beer
is
ranked
so
low
its
not
great
but
its
a
good
session
beer
and
good
for
the
season
its
a
darker
gold
the
head
is
only
around
for
a
few
seconds
the
aroma
im
picking
up
on
is
mainly
cinnamon
im
liking
the
spices
in
this
beer
and
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
you
pick
up
on
the
pumpkin
presence
fairly
easily
as
well
it
is
a
little
too
watery
which
would
be
my
main
complaint
about
it
yet
the
spices
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
to
blend
together
nicely
and
while
its
not
a
great
pumpkin
beer
it
isnt
half
bad
either
definitely
could
have
a
few
of
these
deep
golden
colored
with
great
clarity
a
fingernail
of
eggshell
white
head
is
presentbut
not
for
long
aroma
is
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
taste
is
overwhelmingly
spiced
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
the
spices
are
a
bit
much
haha
to
weak
great
beer
killer
pumpkin
flavor
the
low
abv
keeps
the
geeks
at
bay
whatever
enjoy
a
great
session
pumkin
brew
easy
drinking
with
a
ton
of
flavor
ick
watery
way
too
much
spice
mostly
pumpin
pie
spices
with
a
weak
backbone
just
no
dont
even
bother
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
experienced
thus
far
cinnamon
sugar
around
the
rim
isnt
needed
can
taste
the
flavor
right
away
okay
so
i
really
like
this
beer
in
a
convenience
store
junk
food
kind
of
way
like
when
youre
driving
through
the
dregs
of
pa
and
come
across
a
sheetz
and
its
the
best
thing
ever
even
though
you
know
its
really
very
bad
it
comes
in
cans
which
taste
way
better
than
the
bottles
also
dont
bother
pouring
it
anywhere
else
than
your
mouth
if
you
like
pumpkin
bread
youll
like
this
beer
i
love
this
time
of
the
year
because
of
all
the
pumpkin
beers
that
come
out
i
tend
to
like
the
pumpkin
beers
that
have
a
lot
of
spice
and
pumpkin
flavor
to
them
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
the
reason
that
i
bought
this
beer
is
because
i
wanted
to
try
something
new
the
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
is
not
as
intense
as
i
like
and
once
you
swallow
the
beer
the
flavor
goes
down
with
it
too
sweet
one
is
ok
o
this
one
is
just
too
artificial
tasting
it
reminds
me
or
watered
down
cola
with
cinnamon
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
55
literally
flawless
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
definitely
not
the
color
i
would
expect
from
a
pumpkin
ale
this
is
the
first
pumpkin
ale
that
i
have
had
this
season
that
was
not
the
right
color
looks
like
a
slightly
dark
bud
light
even
though
i
see
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
there
is
a
little
head
and
hardly
any
lacing
aroma
is
extremely
faint
and
i
can
hardly
pick
up
any
smell
of
spice
or
pumpkin
even
though
is
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
and
decent
mouthfeel
this
beer
lacks
any
discernible
flavor
of
pumpkin
and
spice
it
is
very
faint
and
watered
down
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
refreshing
but
this
is
not
like
any
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
little
disappointing
considering
the
other
brews
i
have
had
from
shipyard
i
was
leery
about
buying
a
sixer
after
reading
reviews
but
i
would
have
enjoyed
one
just
fine
a
decent
session
beer
at
4
5
abv
fun
for
a
change
of
pace
in
the
fall
on
a
crisp
evening
need
to
try
some
other
pumpkin
ales
for
comparison
very
disappointed
with
this
one
was
recommended
at
local
liquor
store
and
it
was
one
of
the
few
pumpkin
ales
i
had
yet
to
try
flavor
is
like
budweiser
with
cinnamon
no
pumpkin
or
nutmeg
bad
after
taste
as
well
honestly
has
more
of
a
true
pumpkin
pie
aftertaste
to
it
than
most
pumpkin
beers
out
there
only
con
is
its
very
subtle
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
if
it
was
just
a
little
stronger
it
would
be
one
of
the
best
nothing
spectacular
well
disappointing
i
remembered
this
as
a
pumpkin
beer
where
the
spices
were
strong
and
not
subtle
thats
true
of
the
cinnamon
but
i
prefer
a
pa
with
more
complexity
has
it
changed
or
have
my
tastes
no
idea
not
going
to
be
buying
it
again
though
golden
light
color
you
can
taste
the
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
in
every
sip
truly
an
amazing
beer
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
pumpkin
shandy
this
is
what
i
would
expect
if
to
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
has
a
light
although
distinguished
taste
that
leans
sweet
refreshingly
different
from
typical
pumpkin
beers
laden
with
dark
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
aroma
of
wheat
and
spices
is
just
ok
and
not
as
appealing
as
the
flavor
very
good
pumpkin
pie
note
includes
both
light
spicing
pie
crust
and
the
baked
pumpkin
a
bit
too
sweet
but
fine
as
a
dessert
beer
a
bit
thin
and
flat
an
all
day
kind
of
beer
this
beer
taste
like
cider
crispy
bubbly
muted
spice
profile
could
not
identify
the
typical
flavor
of
pumpkin
pie
except
for
god
awful
cinnamon
sugar
rim
placed
on
my
pint
glass
a
very
spicy
high
diacytel
pilsner
is
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
drinkable
with
a
dulled
spice
profile
very
light
on
the
pumpkin
type
spices
an
above
average
beer
alright
this
beer
has
the
appearance
of
cider
mouthfeel
is
o
k
but
it
has
a
horrible
horrible
metallic
taste
even
worse
is
the
smell
spicescant
even
taste
them
nah
not
worth
my
time
and
only
my
second
drain
pour
dont
understand
the
hate
this
is
an
atypical
beer
very
light
in
color
with
a
light
malt
bill
this
is
is
a
dry
very
pale
ale
with
no
roasted
or
caramel
malts
but
it
has
cinnamon
in
spades
if
someone
set
out
to
make
a
cinnamon
nutmeg
beer
this
would
be
it
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
more
than
expected
it
is
what
it
is
horrible
marketed
in
a
section
of
different
oktoberfest
beers
but
this
is
far
from
anything
on
the
shelf
at
first
its
bad
cider
taste
and
then
youre
stuck
with
that
strange
awful
aftertaste
ive
managed
to
muscle
through
some
pretty
bad
beers
coughalaskan
ambercough
but
this
is
truly
terrible
beer
bad
enough
that
after
tasting
one
the
remaining
5
were
discarded
to
finish
selling
this
at
the
price
point
of
great
brands
like
founders
are
you
serious
shipyard
not
as
terrible
as
the
ratings
reflect
however
i
did
consumer
after
a
hard
train
run
so
nearly
any
beer
sounded
good
overall
i
kind
of
appreciated
the
lightness
of
this
one
not
nearly
as
heavy
as
most
pumpkin
brews
overall
this
beer
is
immensely
popular
but
rarely
receives
critical
praise
i
can
see
why
its
approachable
and
easy
on
the
palate
but
also
lacks
the
depth
and
flavor
id
like
from
a
fall
seasonal
pumpkins
or
not
maybe
i
enjoyed
this
less
than
i
would
have
under
more
ideal
conditions
since
i
had
it
on
a
bakinghot
humid
september
day
still
shipyard
undeniably
has
better
executed
offerings
than
this
not
too
much
going
on
with
this
one
it
is
light
and
toned
down
with
a
slight
pumpkin
flavor
and
hardly
any
other
elements
i
got
a
little
pumpkin
maybe
a
little
apple
and
possibly
a
little
nutmeg
most
likely
i
will
not
buy
any
of
these
probably
the
lightest
bodied
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
i
get
a
clove
and
nutmeg
taste
and
a
little
pumpkin
in
the
aftertaste
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
this
but
its
by
no
means
terrible
thats
absolutely
disgusting
pumpkinhead
is
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
although
for
me
and
im
sure
many
others
it
was
the
first
introduction
to
the
style
i
had
the
appearance
is
a
thin
orange
with
a
little
head
the
smell
is
sweet
with
hints
of
clove
and
sweet
pumpkin
spices
like
nutmeg
the
taste
is
very
sweet
for
a
pumpkin
with
a
lot
of
sugar
in
the
beginning
and
middle
as
far
as
the
pumpkin
itself
it
is
a
little
thin
and
what
is
there
is
a
tad
synthetic
but
still
tasty
overall
not
bad
i
will
never
understand
the
hype
behind
this
beer
it
is
absolute
rubbish
got
a
chance
to
try
this
though
it
is
not
something
i
would
ever
buy
golden
color
decent
head
aroma
was
a
lot
of
honey
which
surprised
me
i
didnt
taste
pumpkin
either
it
was
almost
strictly
honey
i
wonder
if
this
would
taste
better
or
worse
if
it
had
been
fresh
but
either
way
its
probably
still
average
although
this
one
lacks
in
character
is
really
is
my
favorite
fall
beer
its
things
like
drinkability
and
personal
preference
that
can
go
easily
unnoticed
while
this
could
certainly
use
some
work
the
pumpkinnutmeg
flavor
really
does
come
through
in
excellent
fashion
if
you
drink
it
from
the
keg
preferrably
right
from
the
source
in
portland
you
will
notice
the
flavor
while
light
and
airy
on
the
toungue
really
packs
a
deep
punch
in
the
body
of
this
beer
my
favorite
beers
tend
to
be
stouts
my
favorite
so
far
being
the
breakfast
beer
from
founders
brew
and
the
dogfish
head
miles
davis
bitches
brew
so
that
being
said
i
can
understand
why
people
who
are
used
to
loving
a
deep
flavor
lacing
and
body
would
most
likely
hate
this
sweet
bubbly
ale
i
would
advise
you
to
give
it
an
honest
try
this
stuff
is
an
all
day
ale
thats
perfect
for
pairing
with
fall
fooddeserts
it
is
certainly
a
friendly
beer
both
for
your
mouth
and
wallet
if
you
guys
dont
decide
to
drink
it
then
thats
fine
just
means
more
cases
for
me
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkinfall
seasonal
beer
i
know
it
can
be
a
bit
sweet
for
some
and
the
pumpkin
flavor
tastes
a
bit
synthetic
not
exactly
fresh
but
i
find
it
the
most
addictive
to
drink
not
a
super
dark
or
heavy
ale
taste
for
fall
seasonal
a
pumpkin
beer
that
i
dont
get
sick
trying
to
drink
more
than
one
at
once
definitely
a
bit
girly
with
the
cinnamonsugar
rim
but
the
taste
ive
grown
to
associate
with
fall
o
disapointed
in
the
lightness
and
artificial
aspect
of
the
pumpkin
nature
of
this
beer
the
mouth
was
very
thin
and
watery
and
again
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
new
pumpkin
coke
rather
than
a
pumpkin
ale
whatever
shipyard
was
trying
to
do
here
they
swung
and
missed
but
hey
at
least
they
impressed
the
it
guy
at
work
note
15
minutes
after
drinking
this
im
rewarded
with
heartburn
shipyard
recommends
you
pair
this
with
lamb
please
for
the
love
of
god
do
not
do
that
overall
a
pretty
weak
beer
little
body
and
flavor
here
to
work
with
overwhelmed
by
the
spices
eventually
poured
out
the
last
of
it
to
make
way
for
another
beer
overall
i
give
in
an
ok
overall
definitely
not
special
but
it
is
drinkable
worth
it
to
try
it
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
overall
this
beer
is
incredibly
bland
it
does
not
taste
bad
but
there
is
just
nothing
exciting
or
unique
going
on
im
no
pumpkin
expert
but
i
will
get
something
different
next
time
overall
a
completely
serviceable
pumpkin
ale
not
the
best
thing
in
the
world
sure
but
drinkable
enough
on
a
chilly
october
night
o
35
as
always
i
enjoyed
the
auditory
aspect
of
a
big
crack
and
subsequent
to
that
an
inverted
glug
i
got
a
creamy
fluffy
two
fingers
of
bonewhite
from
the
pour
and
then
i
sat
quietly
as
it
slowly
subsided
color
was
a
hazy
light
orangishyellow
srm
4
nose
had
a
lightly
spiced
presence
but
it
was
odd
like
they
may
not
have
gotten
it
precisely
right
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
and
the
taste
was
extremely
light
especially
for
this
style
in
which
spices
are
supposed
to
dominate
finish
was
mildly
spicy
and
i
found
myself
suppressing
a
bored
yawn
rubbish
overall
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
beer
it
falls
short
of
the
mark
for
pumpkin
ales
heres
the
thing
by
itself
its
not
a
great
beer
but
on
tap
with
a
cinnamon
sugar
rim
on
the
glass
its
actually
pretty
nice
i
dont
pretend
to
be
an
expert
but
i
like
what
i
like
and
this
i
liked
better
than
a
lot
of
other
beer
ive
had
lately
like
dogfish
head
60

yuck

pours
a
golden
yellow
in
color
that
has
a
3finger
foamy
white
head
some
spotted
lacing
is
seen
lots
of
carbonation
this
malt
beverage
with
pumpkin
spice
added
aroma
is
of
mostly
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
no
pumpkin
pie
smell
was
actually
detected
actually
the
taste
wasnt
that
bad
but
a
bit
watered
down
could
of
had
more
pumpkin
taste
though

it

having

maybe

just

really

i
think
people
are
too
hard
on
this
beer
it
is
a
little
gimmicky
from
the
bottle
art
to
the
pumpkin
pie
as
opposed
to
the
colonial
pumpkin
flavors
but
it
isnt
a
horrible
beer
in
my
opinion
i
would
recommend
it
for
a
nonbeer
snob
who
wants
to
drink
some
pumpkin
ale

with
the
cinnamonsugar
glass
rim
it
had
a
sort
of
sweet
and
sour
aspect
to
it
but
thats
cheating
isnt
it
without
the
rim
and
in
fact
after
the
coating
had
long
worn
off
i
was
left
with
a
fairly
mainstream
standard
beer
with
mild
pumpkin
aspects
average
o
i
want
to
stand
up
for
pumpkinhead
a
little
after
noticing
a
lot
of
negative
reviews
and
comments
it
may
not
be
a
world
class
beer
and
it
def
plays
2nd
fiddle
to
shipyards
smashed
pumpkin
not
to
mention
a
lot
of
other
great
pumpkin
ales
but
for
the
past
three
years
i
thought
it
was
a
great
beer
to
bridge
the
gap
and
transition
from
late
summer
into
early
fall
before
the
weather
fully
changes
here
in
the
northeast
i
admit
that
if
smashed
pumpkin
were
more
readily
available
i
probably
would
stick
to
that
but
since
that
isnt
the
case
im
happy
to
drink
pumpkinhead
throughout
sept
and
even
into
early
oct
ooverall
id
drink
this
again
i
dont
find
it
revolting
as
some
have
told
me
they
do
but
i
dont
adore
this
beer
either
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
will
i
count
down
the
days
until
its
released
next
year
nope
the
flavor
was
also
mild
and
bland
even
imagine
a
typical
adjunct
lager
beer
with
some
pumpkin
flavoring
dropped
in
and
you
have
this
unimaginative
brew
thanks
but
no
thanks
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
drink
another
i
am
glad
that
i
didnt
buy
a
whole
six
pours
a
pale
orange
with
a
small
quickly
dissipating
white
head
aroma
and
taste
of
sweet
pumpkin
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
palate
is
light
body
moderate
carbonation
and
a
cloying
mouth
feel
finish
is
mostly
sweet
pumpkin
spices
cinnamon
and
some
grassy
notes
overall
nothing
really
exciting
about
this
brew
not
recommended
you
know
what
who
really
cares
its
all
about
the
enjoyment
of
a
beverage
that
someone
has
taken
the
time
to
make
it
their
best
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
within
seconds
into
nothing
the
aroma
is
of
ginger
allspice
and
nutmeg
the
spice
is
so
strong
that
it
not
only
burns
my
nostrils
it
also
burns
the
back
of
my
throat
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
the
same
burning
sensation
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
watery
texture
overall
this
is
a
awful
beer
that
i
hope
i
never
have
to
look
at
again
much
less
drink
do
not
recommend
this
beer
not
even
if
you
are
drunk
color
is
an
orange
hue
with
a
fizzy
head
that
vanishes
into
the
night
i
smell
thin
lager
with
a
brush
of
pumpkin
spice
not
a
drop
of
pumpkin
in
this
beer
flavor
mimics
the
nose
with
nothing
to
offer
over
a
light
lager
flavor
with
a
dash
of
pumpkin
spice
i
was
immensely
disappointed
by
this
one
not
worth
a
thought
a
lite
tastesmell
etc
with
so
many
other
truly
great
pumpkin
beers
to
chose
from
i
wouldnt
by
this
in
case
form
again
but
wouldnt
refuse
it
at
my
local
bar
if
it
was
offered
o
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
as
bad
as
the
reviews
make
it
seem
i
picked
it
up
as
a
single
and
wouldnt
buy
more
than
1
but
its
not
terrible
theres
better
beers
to
drink
though
i
wouldnt
buy
again
but
i
wouldnt
be
mad
if
someone
offered
one
to
me
o
not
a
great
beer
but
not
a
bad
beer
either
would
like
to
have
more
of
a
pumpkin
flavor
present
the
spicing
in
the
beer
is
very
nice
not
too
overpowering
o
not
a
great
beernot
a
good
beer
actually
it
has
a
few
moments
of
mediocrity
but
mostly
the
sweetness
makes
it
hover
just
below
that
level
of
mediocrity
that
would
make
it
passable
for
an
occasional
autumn
quaff
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
the
taste
isnt
that
bad
more
flavorful
than
color
suggests
less
cloying
than
the
smell
suggests
but
its
not
good
enough
id
like
more
substantial
malt
flavors
roasty
bready
whatever
to
cut
through
the
cinammon
on
that
note
a
more
complex
blend
of
warm
spices
would
be
nice
too
this
beer
is
waterthin
too
slick
utterly
insubstantial
at
best
it
has
some
drinkability
thats
about
all
i
can
say
for
it
overall
michelobs
jacks
pumpkin
spice
is
a
better
example
of
the
pumpkin
ale
style
seriously
really
nothing
special
ive
had
much
better
pumpkin
beers
and
ill
probably
never
buy
again
o
not
recommended
o
this
beer
is
definitely
very
easy
to
drink
im
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
this
all
night
with
the
sweetness
and
spices
but
it
definitely
would
pair
well
with
an
autumn
dish
at
dinner
o
very
disappointing
there
is
so
very
little
pumpkin
in
this
beer
light
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
cloying
on
the
sweetness
average
pumpkin
ale
but
not
offensive
o
one
of
the
less
spiced
nutmeg
cinnamon
allsipe
pumpkin
beers
out
there
the
malt
flavor
comes
through
more
than
most
o
really
not
a
terrible
beer
but
it
just
had
something
off
about
it
that
i
made
me
not
care
to
have
it
again
mouthfeel
and
overall
very
light
and
refreshing
especially
in
the
final
days
of
summer
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
when
you
dont
want
a
heavy
pumpkin
ale
the
appearance
of
this
pumpkin
ale
is
that
of
a
cider
its
almost
identical
to
an
apple
juice
color
a
deep
golden
hue
the
head
with
a
hard
pour
starts
out
very
fizzy
and
bubbly
but
soon
disappears
leaving
no
lacing
as
the
beer
goes
down
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
dominate
the
aroma
here
the
taste
is
the
most
disappointing
aspect
of
this
brew
quite
simply
there
is
no
pumpkin
flavor
period
if
they
would
label
this
as
an
autumn
ale
or
something
like
that
then
i
would
be
okay
with
it
but
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
pumpkin
offering
again
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
are
present
it
taste
like
fall
but
not
pumpkin
whatsoever
the
mouthfeel
is
much
like
an
adjunct
lager
carbonated
easily
drinkable
maybe
too
sharp
this
beer
feels
more
like
a
cider
i
feel
that
its
totally
mislabeled
and
that
is
not
good
if
youre
looking
for
hearty
warm
pumpkin
offering
this
beer
is
clearly
polarized
among
the
ba
folks
some
hate
it
some
like
it
some
call
it
meh
i
think
its
a
decent
example
of
a
lighter
pumpkin
beer
starts
off
with
some
malt
presence
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
and
follows
up
with
a
clean
unpretentious
offering
of
pumpkin
spices
yes
there
are
quite
a
few
better
examples
of
pumpkin
beer
on
the
market
but
id
happily
call
this
an
introduction
to
the
style
it
starts
off
like
a
typical
light
ale
and
follows
it
with
a
light
note
of
october
and
november
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bad
beer
enough
said
poured
into
a
glasslooking
plastic
pint
ironically
the
label
on
the
cup
says
coors
light
which
is
exactly
what
this
looks
like
actually
coors
light
has
a
better
head
smell
is
overspiced
and
cinnamon
heavy
palate
is
clean
and
spicy
with
a
very
small
malt
profile
hops
are
a
nonfactor
im
not
tasting
any
actual
pumpkin
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fluid
with
overthetop
carbonation
not
a
great
beer
and
a
poor
attempt
at
a
pumpkin
beer
this
beer
doesnt
cut
it
when
it
comes
to
fall
specials
i
dont
recommend
o
the
weakest
attempt
at
this
style
that
i
have
tried
along
with
buffalo
bills
draino
a
sip
is
light
and
fizzy
a
bit
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
maltiness
to
it
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
not
pumpkin
its
easy
to
drink
because
it
really
doesnt
taste
like
anything
crisp
but
not
something
id
want
on
a
cool
fall
this
is
like
i
dont
know
i
think
this
was
what
initially
turned
me
off
of
the
style
my
coworker
is
psyched
to
buy
a
case
of
this
every
fall
glad
i
just
got
the
one
overall
i
like
the
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
flavor
and
the
crispness
of
this
beer
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
but
certainly
not
the
worst
o
well
i
picked
this
one
up
for
the
wife
since
she
likes
pumpkin
ales
shes
probably
gonna
beat
my
ass
for
this
one
this
brew
is
not
good
by
any
means
overall
not
as
bad
as
i
remember
it
from
the
bottle
but
not
great
either
its
a
bit
of
a
mess
with
all
the
sweet
additions
and
some
pumpkin
i
was
a
little
nervous
about
trying
this
beer
after
reading
about
it
on
here
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
this
at
the
local
grocery
store
i
was
craving
a
pumpkin
beer
i
was
very
happy
with
everything
as
it
relates
to
this
beer
this
is
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
that
remains
with
dogfish
head
but
still
a
very
decent
beer
best
before
jan
2012
straight
from
the
bottle
classy
has
a
nice
spice
note
but
not
much
pumpkin
flavor
pretty
sweet
some
slightly
roasted
malts
body
is
fairly
mediumlight
its
an
average
pumpkin
ale
that
i
could
certainly
session
but
it
does
fall
short
in
a
lot
of
areas
i
had
this
beer
at
a
party
three
years
ago
and
i
dont
remember
it
being
too
bad
tonight
i
feel
like
ive
insulted
my
taste
buds
this
beer
isnt
awful
i
can
understand
why
the
bud
light
crowd
would
enjoy
this
but
it
is
an
insult
to
the
pumpkin
ale
style
currently
i
cant
decide
what
is
worse
this
beer
or
shipyards
premium
smashed
pumpkin
pugsleys
signature
series
both
beers
make
me
cry
a
little
i
see
this
pumpkin
ale
doesnt
fare
too
well
on
ba
however
its
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
especially
based
on
my
dislike
for
pumpkin
ales
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
orange
hue
with
a
bright
white
creamy
head
fine
speckled
lacing
down
the
sides
of
my
chalice
not
much
head
retention
to
speak
of
large
stream
of
bubbles
coming
from
the
base
of
my
glass
aroma
is
straight
up
pumpkin
spice
and
artifical
pumpkin
notes
with
an
air
of
creaminess
seems
very
dessert
like
especially
as
it
warms
im
really
trying
not
to
enjoy
this
but
its
not
that
bad
definitely
not
an
f
i
hate
to
say
it
i
despise
this
brewery
the
diacetyl
buttery
tones
weigh
too
heavy
in
most
of
their
standard
offerings
this
just
seems
like
a
fun
festive
bastaradized
fall
ale
flavor
is
sweet
almost
candy
sweet
with
something
pumpkin
gourd
like
floating
around
with
somewhat
abrasive
harsh
pumpkin
pie
spices
contained
within
each
sip
finishes
a
bit
medicinal
and
watery
a
dull
spiced
ale
that
doesnt
let
beer
shine
in
its
original
format
of
malted
barley
hops
yeast
and
h20
not
a
purist
but
this
beer
doesnt
inspire
me
to
think
wow
these
guys
have
gone
somewhere
where
every
other
fall
seasonal
has
already
attempted
and
perfected
to
go
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
like
i
said
in
the
finish
it
gets
a
bit
cloying
with
harsh
pumpkin
spices
peaking
through
overall
could
i
session
with
a
beer
like
this
absolutely
not
sitting
here
trying
to
wrap
my
mind
about
why
somebody
wants
to
continues
to
and
makes
a
profit
at
this
beer
is
beyond
me
i
guess
thats
part
of
the
fun
of
the
wave
of
seasonals
that
come
out
each
year
when
compared
to
the
other
pumpkin
beers
out
there
this
one
is
definitely
bottom
of
the
barrel
but
i
guess
the
bid
light
drinkers
need
pumpkin
beer
too
this
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
win
a
decent
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
pumpkin
spice
only
no
hint
o
pumpkin
the
flavor
is
like
a
bud
light
with
pumpkin
pie
spice
added
in
the
mouhfeel
is
light
with
ok
carbonation
this
her
is
really
not
worn
the
time
of
day
it
takes
to
drink
it
overall
ill
never
understand
the
fascination
with
this
beer
its
thin
lacks
any
depth
of
flavor
lacks
a
real
pumpkin
flavor
or
aroma
and
plays
too
heavy
with
the
spices
i
feel
like
im
missing
something
here
the
only
upside
this
is
so
easy
going
down
if
you
can
make
it
over
the
spice
component
you
could
drink
50
m
in
between
light
to
medium
bodied
small
crackerlike
bready
mouthfeel
im
a
bit
disappointed
but
i
expected
this
after
not
going
back
to
this
brew
after
2yrs
the
worse
part
is
that
i
have
a
6
pack
of
this
o
overall
this
is
an
alright
pumpkin
beer
there
are
much
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
its
good
for
a
thirst
quencher
but
when
you
stop
to
think
about
it
its
just
an
ok
beer
o
just
a
mess
of
a
beer
i
really
hate
to
review
bad
beers
but
hey
for
my
own
reference
and
if
anyone
else
reads
my
reviews
do
not
waste
the
1
99
or
whatever
on
this
one
ive
had
this
beer
before
i
kind
of
knew
what
i
was
getting
into
here
and
i
remembered
correctly
this
is
a
piss
poor
example
of
a
pumpkin
beer
any
trace
of
what
this
should
be
is
very
faint
and
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
o
its
really
not
awful
i
think
many
of
you
are
being
extra
harsh
since
the
ba
boys
gave
it
an
f
but
i
will
agree
that
i
have
had
many
better
pumpkin
beers
than
this
pours
a
light
crystal
clear
yellow
with
a
finger
or
so
of
white
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
small
bubbles
cling
to
the
side
of
the
glass
and
shoot
up
to
the
top
of
the
liquid
the
smell
is
all
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
taste
is
the
same
with
a
slight
pumpkin
though
i
may
just
be
imagining
it
because
of
the
spices
lots
of
sweetness
and
a
strong
buttery
overtone
theres
a
slight
acidic
twang
in
the
finish
and
a
hint
of
corn
tasting
grains
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
i
know
this
is
an
ale
but
it
really
drinks
like
a
spiced
adjunct
lager
i
can
see
how
this
would
have
a
lot
of
mass
appeal
but
really
its
not
for
me
did
not
like
this
beer
and
will
not
try
it
again
i
was
expecting
something
different
but
the
taste
wasnt
awful
the
flavors
were
kind
of
awkward
bit
cinnamonypepppermint
definitely
would
recommend
trying
something
else
though
although
im
not
sure
if
i
would
this
give
a
beer
an
f
it
definitely
was
not
up
to
expectations
o
honestly
i
think
this
gets
poor
reviews
because
there
are
no
hops
and
the
malts
are
pretty
weak
but
treat
this
how
its
supposed
to
be
treated
as
a
pumpkin
pie
flavored
beer
and
like
i
said
this
needs
to
be
super
fresh
or
else
it
is
a
beer
morphed
into
alcoholic
soda
simple
as
that
but
damn
i
do
love
this
beer
fresh
d
i
should
have
resisted
there
are
some
redeeming
qualities
and
for
the
record
my
girlfriend
loved
it
but
this
just
isnt
what
i
want
or
look
for
in
my
pumpkin
ales
overall
if
you
want
a
new
england
pumpkinfall
ale
this
is
probably
not
what
you
are
looking
for
but
if
you
want
a
novel
pumpkin
pie
drink
to
go
with
a
meal
you
should
give
this
a
whirl
maybe
i
judge
beer
in
a
strane
way
but
this
beer
to
me
embodie
the
season
just
as
much
as
the
smell
of
dry
leaves
and
the
crunch
underfoot
warm
afternoons
and
cold
nights
thank
you
shipyard
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
fizzy
looking
golden
color
shouldnt
this
be
more
of
a
copped
color
anyway
theres
no
head
after
a
few
seconds
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
spicy
thats
about
all
the
taste
is
spicy
but
very
light
the
mouthfeel
is
like
club
soda
overall
i
really
dont
like
this
pumpkin
ale
its
very
bland
and
boring
from
start
to
finish
be
smart
and
look
elsewhere
for
a
pumpkin
ale
over
this
one
it
smelled
like
an
old
batch
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
that
had
been
in
the
cupboard
too
long
it
tasted
like
a
really
bad
pumpkin
pie
that
had
been
regurgitated
cloying
way
over
spiced
and
too
pumpkiny
i
heve
nothing
against
this
style
btw
smuttynose
pumpkin
ale
is
a
seasonal
favorite
but
this
has
no
subtleties
balance
or
sense
of
overall
finish
gave
it
back
and
asked
for
the
halloween
o
this
is
a
joke
of
an
excuse
for
a
real
pumpkin
ale
and
further
proof
that
shipyard
has
no
reason
to
brew
any
beer
seriously
stop
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
was
extremely
surprised
to
see
the
grades
it
has
received
i
would
agree
that
as
a
beer
it
is
not
amazing
but
as
a
pumpkin
seasonal
drink
it
is
very
satisfying
md
feels
good

easy

dissipates

into
a
thin

more

flavor
is
thin
and
watery
pumpkin

spices
with
some
sweeter
caramel
and
strong
cinnamon
finishes
with
no
real
character
after
a
thin
body
and
fizzy
carbonation
overall
a
distinct
pumpkin
flavored
beer
but
not
very
rounded
or
balanced
watery
with
a
little
too
much
spice
and
not
enough
malts
appearance
isnt
bad
looked
kinda
lagery
to
me
but
thats
ok
pours
a
nice
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
very
spicy
and
pumpkiny
smells
excellent
hmm
taste
is
ok
the
body
is
very
very
light
just
like
the
color
indicated
it
kinda
tastes
like
water
with
pumpkin
and
spice
in
it
with
a
tiny
hint
of
malt
in
the
back
end
the
taste
is
not
very
impressive
i
cant
tell
if
i
want
to
drink
more
or
not
so
i
will
say
the
drinkability
is
average
overall
disappointing
but
not
a
horrible
beer
d
if
you
love
cinammon
red
hots
its
very
drinkable
its
a
low
abv
beer
so
its
drinkable
in
that
respect
personally
i
just
couldnt
stomach
the
flavor
for
more
than
a
bottle
or
two
i
originally
did
not
think
this
pumpkin
ale
was
as
bad
as
smome
of
the
reviews
it
has
recieved
until
i
tasted
some
others
namely
dfh
punkin
and
pumking
pours
a
orange
color
and
has
some
light
highlights
little
head
and
a
little
lacing
smelled
of
cinnammon
alot
like
cinnammon
maybe
a
few
whiffs
of
hops
taste
was
way
to
undone
too
much
or
too
little
of
toomnay
things
puumpkin
flavor
was
artificial
and
spices
did
not
seem
like
they
were
blended
mouthfeel
was
off
bitter
even
with
all
the
better
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
maybe
the
worst
tasting
craft
beer
on
the
market
the
cinnamon
taste
was
overwhelming
but
not
a
good
cinnamon
more
of
a
big
red
flavor
really
tastes
like
they
used
very
bad
extracts
on
this
one
the
malt
flavor
is
also
poor
might
not
be
too
bad
but
the
crappy
pumpkin
flavor
along
with
the
awful
cinnamon
overpowers
anything
else
this
beer
has
to
offer
this
was
the
first
pumpkin
ale
i
ever
tried
back
in
the
day
if
bud
light
made
a
pumpkin
ale
this
would
be
it
i
would
avoid
this
one
come
fall
its
a
disservice
to
the
style
i
cant
believe
there
was
actually
a
moment
in
time
where
i
thought
this
beer
was
good
gotta
love
the
palate
dmaybe
if
this
beer
were
more
like
a
beer
it
would
be
enjoyable
however
the
pumpkin
is
far
too
overwhelming
and
the
beer
far
too
little
in
flavor
d
i
will
have
a
hard
time
drinking
another
one
of
these
the
bad
part
is
there
is
three
more
in
my
verity
pack
wow
this
pumpkin
ale
is
taking
a
beating
in
the
ratings
i
think
its
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
though
it
grew
on
me
as
i
worked
my
way
through
poured
a
light
orange
with
a
fine
white
head
nose
of
pumpkin
spice
and
slight
pumpkin
i
can
taste
some
pumpkin
at
the
finish
lightbodied
and
pretty
crisp
and
some
earthy
flavor
thats
hard
to
describe
i
think
i
have
been
getting
spoiled
with
some
unbelievable
pumpkin
ales
weyerbacherdogfish
headsouthern
tier
to
name
a
few
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
4oz
sampling
glass
it
poured
an
apricot
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
didnt
retain
or
lace
very
well
very
little
carbonation
too
a
very
nondescript
nose
preceded
a
flavor
that
was
all
maltyapply
fruity
with
very
little
spice
flavor
sweet
finish
as
well
thin
flat
feel
very
bad
specimen
d
nightmare
if
this
were
alcoholfree
which
prove
to
me
it
isnt
and
was
marketed
as
a
pumpkin
soda
i
still
wouldnt
drink
it
d
not
my
favorite
in
terms
of
pumpkin
ales
but
i
give
it
an
average
rating
as
a
primmer
ale
for
those
novice
ale
drinkers
looking
to
expand
their
horizons
just
be
sure
to
have
another
pumpkin
ale
on
hand
to
compare
it
to

overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
thin
and
the
finish
is
light
this
beer
lacks
depth
and
flavor
making
it
a
tad
hard
to
drink
i
feel
that
if
there
was
some
depth
flavor
and
body
this
would
be
a
very
nice
beer
the
feel
and
body
is
what
this
beer
lacks
its
not
watery
for
ample
carbonation
keeps
things
crisp
but
its
nothing
more
than
light
and
thin
some
thickness
or
a
bit
more
of
an
interesting
feel
would
have
really
sent
this
one
to
the
chilly
november
sky
obviously
easy
to
drink
im
damn
near
done
with
it
before
i
know
it
d
i
was
expecting
an
abomination
from
what
ive
heard
about
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
that
terrible
its
definitely
a
lot
more
lightlagerlike
as
i
kept
saying
and
it
certainly
needs
a
lot
more
malt
but
it
would
make
for
a
fair
early
fall
lawnmower
refresher
i
find
this
beer
to
be
of
average
drinkability
i
can
have
one
or
two
bottles
but
there
are
other
fall
seasonals
i
prefer
i
know
this
beer
is
a
big
seller
here
in
shipyards
home
market
but
i
think
it
is
more
of
a
novelty
beverage
than
a
wellcrafted
beer
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
little
white
fizzy
head
that
fizzled
out
quickly
to
nothing
the
body
is
a
pale
yellow
color
almost
like
apple
juice
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
i
smell
a
strong
aroma
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamonnutmeg
more
dominant
the
taste
is
just
like
pumpkin
pie
and
not
much
else
this
has
a
smooth
mouth
feel
and
is
drinkable
i
like
it
my
beer
distributor
guy
said
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
poured
this
halloween
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
it
looked
pretty
much
like
a
beer
with
not
much
head
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
of
cinnamon
and
had
kinda
of
a
apple
pie
taste
to
it
i
thought
it
was
okay
i
guess
for
a
novelty
beer
i
would
not
buy
it
again
though
d
not
bad
spicy
ale
i
was
kinda
expecting
some
pumpkin
though
d
fairly
drinkable
even
though
a
bit
empty
beyond
the
spices
not
really
a
bad
beer
just
a
bit
unbalanced
overall
light
body
and
easy
to
drink
but
too
thin
and
too
heavy
on
the
spices
maybe
that
is
what
they
were
going
for
here
and
i
suspect
it
is
popular
with
the
masses
basically
a
thin
beer
with
spices
poured
in
d
eh
like
i
mentioned
above
used
to
drink
this
all
the
time
not
sure
what
i
was
thinking
pretty
low
on
the
pumpkin
beer
scale
edit
whats
funny
but
this
might
make
it
worse
disgusting
spicy
feel
covering
up
the
putrid
rot
that
lies
underneath
unbelievably
undrinkable

its
easy

theres
no

thing

about

it

the

is

the

with
the
pumpkin
coming
through
a
bit
more
than
it
did
in
the
aroma
the
light
body
and
decent
carbonation
make
this
a
pretty

there
is
a

of

on

that
lays
on

a

pumpkin
taste
with

harsh
backbite

hate
beers
that
pass

alright
and
then
leave
a

this

didnt
a

in

dissolves
to

overall
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
beer
and
ill
probably
get
it
again
next
autumn
but
its
not
spectacular
if
it
had
a
little
more
body
in
the
mouthfeel
the
beer
would
be
much
better
bordering
special
but
alas
it
doesnt
still
worth
a
try
if
youve
never
had
it
and
maybe
a
revisit
if
you
have
pretty
solid
brew
i
wish
it
had
more
pumpkin
flavor
to
it
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
for
9
first
beer
from
maine
great
in
all
a
solid
if
high

pumpkin

i
would
drink
this
one
again
had
for
halloween
with

surprisingly
decent
tasted

color
with
excellent
clarity
a
fingernail
of
off
white

covers
half
of
the
top
aroma
of

clove
are
what
i
detect
the
flavor
is
heavy
with
cinnamonallspiceand
clove
the
body
is
moderately
carbonated
and
aggressively
spiced
overall
worth
seeking
out
especially
if
you
like
the
style

saw
that
they
had
a
barrel
aged

that
would
be
interesting
to
try
shipyard
smashed
pumpkin
ale
pours
orange
with
hints
of
amber
and
red
the
smell
leads
a
little
cinnamony
but
picks
up
nutmeg
and
allspice
the
smell
hints
slightly
earthy
picking
up
a
whiff
vanilla
extract
and
squash
scent
the
body
is
heavy
and
starts
off
a
little
sweet
but
quickly
turns
toward
a
heavily
spiced
squash
and
pumpkin
flavor
the
spices
remain
strong
pulling
strongly
toward
allspice
and
clove
with
a
touch
of
cinnamon
somehow
on
the
ending
it
is
slightly
mouth
drying
and
channels
a
huge
amount
of
cinnamon
complimented
by
pumpkin
spice
and
pumpkin
spice
is
main
taste
not
pumpkin
at
all
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
strong
pumpkin
ale
compared
to
others
o
it
just
seemed
as
if
this
beer
was
slightly
off
could
not
quite
tell
what
it
was
apart
from
that
not
enough
pumpkin
flavor
as
much
as
i
expected
will
wait
for
it
to
warm
a
bit
as
i
drink
before
i
rush
too
much
judgment
but
definitely
not
what
i
had
hoped
for
o
overall
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
a
huge
departure
from
the
staple
from
the
brewery
in
the
pumpkin
ale
style
pumpkinhead
pumpkinhead
is
light
bodied
refreshing
very
sweet
and
highly
carbonated
this
beer
is
twice
the
abv
less
carbonated
less
sweet
and
not
as
drinkable
atleast
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
glass
a
good
beer
but
not
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
taste
sweet
like
pumpkin
pie
at
first
then
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
kick
in
to
balance
it
out
im
not
sure
if
i
had
a
bad
bottle
but
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
doesnt
even
remotely
taste
like
pumpkin
but
super
sweet
drain
pour
most
of
it
the
beer
pours
a
very
light
and
white
foamy
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
copper
that
isnt
anything
to

about
the
beer
smell
has
strong
spice
pumpkin
hops
and
vanilla
notes
the
spice
notes
are
very
light
compared
to
other
pumpkin
ales
and
barely
register
while
the
vanilla
and
hop
notes
dominate
the
smell
the
hops
are
floral
and
lightly
bitter
the
pumpkin
also
shows
up
but
is
dominated
by
the
vanilla
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
in
that
the
vanilla
dominates
the
pumpkin
and
other
notes
however
the
hops
and
the
vanilla
mix
well
with
the
pumpkin
and
make
it
a
more
interesting
if
not
more
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
very
little
carbonation
and
the
pumpkin
has
a
fairly
velvety
feel
to
it
which
isnt
bad
and
works
a
bit
with
the
kind
of
beer
overall
a
much
better
offering
than
pumking
and
probably
worth
getting
over
that
one
for
next
year
poured
a
very
deep
amber
the
spices
were
evident
immediately
but
way
to
much
it
smelted
like
cinnamon
ginger
and
allspice
just
very
overpowering
i
forgot
there
was
a
beer
underneath
that
nose
the
taste
was
again
spice
dominating
and
not
particularly
well
balance
do
as
it
warmed
it
got
a
little
less
messy
but
something
just
tasted
off
the
hops
were
not
evident
and
the
malt
character
was
not
really
there

2
5012
oz
single
overall
having
pretty
much
given
up
on
this
brewery
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
smashed
blueberry
and
decided
to
give
smashed
pumpkin
a
whirl
wish
i
hadnt
light
copper
spicy
nose
the
pie
spices
are
very
forward
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
but
also
something
a
bit
mediciney
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
pours
a
very
nice
clear
pumpkin
color
with
a
slightly
weak
head
and
lacing
nice
pumpkin
aroma
coming
from
this
brew
pumpkin
flavor
and
pumpkin
spices
are
nice
and
taste
good
feel
is
nice
also
but
a
little
too
much
alcohol
taste
and
afterburn
believe
this
would
have
been
a
much
better
beer
at
about
68
abv
overall
commendable
but
not
great
i
just
think
this
stuff
is
great
they
hit
all
the
right
stuff
here
i
will
say
i
didnt
get
much
pumpkin
in
the
flavor
but
i
usually
dont
with
most
pumpkins
and
for
that
reason
i
dont
hold
it
against
them
anymore
i
would
totally
buy
this
again
even
after
proclaiming
i
was
done
with
the
pumpkins
for
the
season
ive
really
had
a
lot
but
this
ones
a
standout
this
year
for
me
dont
bother
trying
to
age
this
one
it
just
doesnt
hold
up
over
time
have
it
fresh
where
the
facekicking
barleywine
effect
is
still
spiced
and
pie
like
its
really
nothing
at
all
like
pumpkinhead
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
when
you
are
pouring
it
looks
great
the
initial
smell
is
promising
but
then
overwhelming
the
taste
at
first
is
too
strong
but
overtime
it
does
become
better
i
think
that
mixing
this
beer
with
southern
tier
pumking
might
taste
good
o
i
think
it
depends
on
what
you
are
looking
for
with
your
pumpkin
beer
if
you
want
something
that
is
sweet
warm
and
strong
the
kind
of
drink
that
just
feels
right
when
the
temperature
starts
to
drop
in
the
evening
in
the
fall
then
this
is
a
solid
option
but
if
you
want
something
that
makes
you
say
oh
yeah
they
made
this
shit
out
of
pumpkins
then
this
might
not
be
your
goto
overall
i
dont
think
this
is
the
greatest
pumpkin
beer
ever
made
but
it
is
pretty
solid
and
i
definitely
wouldnt
mind
having
another
on
a
cool
october
night
very
drinkable
beer
probably
due
to
the
subtlety
of
everything
this
is
very
enjoyable
drink
but
there
are
other
pumpkins
i
go
to
if
im
really
craving
a
pumpkin
ale
in
the
fall
also
this
stuff
is
pretty
pricey
on
the
west
coast
tastes
like
double
crooked
tree
with
a
hint
of
pumkin
and
spice
overall
really
not
the
best
imperial
pumpkin
out
there
and
at
8
99
for
a
bomber
it
is
certainly
not
worth
it
southertier
pumpking
and
elysians
the
great
pumpkin
which
are
of
similar
style
and
price
are
a
much
better
go
too
a
decent
try
but
really
just
a
little
too
off
to
be
worth
it
o
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
offerings
of
this
type
overall
a
very
sweet
pumkin
beer
could
use
some
additional
pumkin
taste
and
less
malt
but
still
quite
good
i
applaud
the
fact
that
the
spices
are
kept
under
control
still
a
quality
pumpkin
ale
that
makes
up
a
big
caliber
member
of
the
style
as
it
is
an
imperial
o
like
most
in
the
style
heavy
on
spices
pours
into
an
impy
nonic
a
lighter
copper
color
with
an
orange
huea
thin
quick
to
fade
head
atop
strong
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
in
the
nose
along
with
sweet
alcoholvery
strong
spice
nutmeg
is
way
to
strong
flavorwise
to
go
along
with
almost
hot
cinnamon
spice
in
the
finish
to
go
along
with
sweet
alcohol
to
much
spice
and
alcohol
for
me
to
really
enjoyill
take
the
smashed
blueberry
but
not
this
i
dont
understand
pumpkin
beers
that
dont
use
pumpkin
as
the
dominant
flavor
still
a
solid
beer
that
goes
well
with
a
cool
autumn
night
a
decently
rendered
big
pumpkin
ale
the
alcohol
kept
under
wraps
for
the
most
part
letting
the
spice
take
the
um
heat
for
the
inherent
astringency
of
it
all
to
no
overall
ill
effect
perhaps
one
of
the
more
aptlynamed
offerings
from
this
brewery
as
the
18proof
strength
will
certainly
catch
up
to
you
and
me
as
i
continue
to
focus
solely
on
the
gradeschool
holiday
spiciness
o
overall
i
felt
this
beer
had
a
bit
more
spice
then
pumpkin
flavors
it
wasnt
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
but
it
was
good
the
alcohol
was
masked
insanely
well
for
9
abv
i
would
pick
this
up
again
it
may
be
just
me
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
beer
nothing
over
the
top
as
far
as
flavor
but
if
you
like
a
nice
cinnamon
bomb
this
beer
is
for
you
easy
drinker
with
a
high
undetectable
abv
taste
is
quite
good
the
apple
theme
continues
onto
the
flavor
and
is
very
apple
pieesque
the
abv
is
very
well
integrated
and
the
spices
are
plentiful
but
dont
seem
overbearing
maybe
a
restrained
use
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
is
certainly
there
and
a
stack
of
apple
slices
with
cinnamon
and
honey
on
top
of
some
graham
crackers
wouldnt
taste
a
whole
lot
different
than
this
very
good
beer
i
am
impressed
it
manages
to
differentiate
itself
from
the
gaggle
of
pumpkin
beers
without
being
too
extreme
if
that
makes
any
sense
o
glad
that
this
is
in
4packs
because
i
find
it
hard
to
go
in
on
a
pumpkin
bomber
too
much
variability
popping
the
top
this
brew
smells
of
cinnamon
and
spice
and
everything
nice
pours
to
a
deep
bronze
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
on
the
taste
this
is
as
close
to
liquid
apple
pie
as
you
can
get
nice
spices
up
front
with
a
sweet
pumpkin
middle
with
a
slightly
bitter
fade
into
the
aftertaste
the
9
abv
is
barely
noticeable
except
for
the
mouthfeel
that
is
thick
like
syrup
this
is
a
great
fall
warmer
upper
a
welldone
pumpkin
beer
that
reminded
me
of
pumpkin
bread
o
bold
and
sweet
with
an
emphasis
on
nutmeg
the
alcohol
is
hidden
quite
well
considering
the
9
overall
very
good
for
the
style
and
would
probably
hold
up
well
to
cellaring
4
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
has
great
lacing
and
feels
good
in
the
belly
worth
a
try
if
you
like
pumpkin
brew
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
but
overshadowed
by
pumking
from
southern
tier
which
outclasses
it
in
all
regards

and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
big

a
very
enjoyable
offering
this
beer
is
truly
something
different
and
stands
out
from
other
pumpkin
beers
out
there
it
has
very
rich
flavor
of
pumpkin
complimented
with
a
slighter
notes
of
yams
cranberry
and
cinnamon
to
liven
it
up
it
has
a
bold
and
ripe
flavor
that
is
quite
refreshing
compared
to
most
pumpkin
beers
with
load
up
on
spice
and
lack
on
pumpkin
flavor
to
me
its
very
well
done
its
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
and
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
pretty
much
a
onetrick
pony
smells
and
tastes
like
nutmeg
the
vegetableness
actually
a
fruit
of
the
pumpkin
hides
behind
the
spice
the
9
abv
is
well
hidden
the
appearance
is
unremarkable
some
will
rave
but
this
is
just
not
an
outstanding
pumpkin
ale
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkins
always
drink
at
room
temperature
the
appearance
is
a
dark
orange
with
an
off
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
pumpkin
but
also
some
spices
such
as
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
taste
was
great
with
sweet
flavors
in
the
beginning
such
as
the
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
going
into
heavy
cream
notes
and
then
finishing
with
a
clean
bite
little
boozy
but
very
satisfying
the
willamette
hops
bring
out
the
spice
quality
in
this
pumpkin
ale
this
is
a
nice
big
pumpkin
ale
full
of
alcohol
and
flavor
you
can
get
a
few
different
layers
of
flavor
coming
in
as
the
beer
comes
in
and
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
for
me
it
was
like
eating
a
pumpkin
loaf
of
some
kind
the
pour
is
a
clear
copper
orange
with
a
bubbly
off
white
head
nose
is
heavy
spice
light
pumpkin
fair
bit
stale
grain
taste
has
a
very
strong
pumpkin
spice
lighter
grain
than
the
nose
and
is
also
less
stale
soft
carb
medium
body
and
creamy
palate
wouldnt
usually
go
for
pumpkin
beers
but
had
this
one
was
given
to
me
by
a
friend
so
excited
to
try
it
what
there
is
of
the
thin
tan
head
escapes
quickly
leaving
only
a
reddishorange
brew
aroma
consists
of
spice
yeast
pumpkin
and
sugar
can
you
say
dessert
tastes
just
like
your
favorite
pumpkin
pie
with
a
little
alcohol
added
for
good
measure
if
we
are
going
by
style
alone
and
staying
true
to
moniker
then
this
beer
is
top
10
o
a
refined
pumpkin
ale
with
partially
hidden
alcohol
and
subtle
spicing
recommended
overall
nice
pumpkin
ale
a
little
heavy
on
the
spice
but
it
worked
with
the
9abv
would
seek
this
out
again
not
a
bad
ale
overall
overall
i
might
buy
this
again
due
to
the
realness
of
the
flavor
everything
tastes
natural
but
again
too
spicy
overall
i
remember
thinking
high
of
this
last
year
dont
know
if
it
changed
or
i
did
but
im
not
blown
away
really
if
the
cinnamon
was
toned
down
and
pumpkin
toned
up
along
with
some
of
the
other
spices
this
beer
could
be
a
lot
better
not
unenjoyable
just
not
great
3
5
overall
i
think
this
was
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
i
think
the
smell
was
this
beers
greatest
strength
as
it
warmed
i
was
losing
interest
sort
of
one
note
and
tart
which
is
kind
of
strange
for
a
pumpkin
beer
o
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
seasonals
that
you
can
get
also
one
of
shipyards
better
brews
to
give
this
one
credit
i
did
discover
last
years
batch
lurking
in
my
beer
cellar
but
it
clocks
in
at
9
abv
so
i
figured
it
would
still
be
drinkable
aroma
has
malty
sweetness
nutmeg
and
an
earthy
tartness
the
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
deep
orange
with
a
large
white
head
flavor
has
an
initial
burst
of
sweet
malt
fading
to
a
pleasant
nutmeg
character
this
has
some
sweettart
flavors
in
the
tail
end
mixed
with
a
musty
earthiness
very
notable
alcohol
burn
and
a
bitter
astringent
finish
starts
great
ends
not
so
good
perhaps
the
age
has
hurt
this
one
but
i
havent
had
it
fresh
so
i
just
have
to
judge
based
on
what
is
in
my
glass
i
give
it
a
low
score
for
the
unpleasant
finishwife
and
i
didnt
finish
it
o
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
that
could
do
with
less
alcohol
and
more
spice
750ml
into
a
tulip
very
carbonated
2
finger
head
light
amber
color
nose
is
heavy
on
malt
with
very
faint

extremely
complex
taste
malt
cinnamon
nutmeg
pumpkin
finishes
with
honey
and
a
spicy
alcohol
burn
that
is
rather
pleasant
complexity
of
flavors
surprised
me
a
lot
very
enjoyable
brew
overall
i
liked
this
a
little
bit
less
and
less
the
more
i
drank
it
the
more
i
thought
about
how
syrupy
and
medicinal
it
tasted
the
more
that
came
true
drinks
easy
for
the
style
abv
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
or
brewery
but
this
beer
is
worthy
i
would
buy
this
again
would
like
to
try
a
new
bottle
one
with
a
bout
a
year
my
guess
is
this
best
drank
within
3
months
of
release
but
you
never
know
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
flavoring
this
showed
just
this
phenomenal
blend
of
pumpkin
spiciness
and
the
flavors
of
apple
crisp
and
freshly
pressed
apple
cider
that
just
screams
autumn
this
remains
nice
throughout
and
with
warmth
and
never
becomes
overbearing
or
stale
the
nose
on
the
other
hand
does
essentially
the
same
thing
making
us
imagine
some
glorious
hybrid
of
pumpkin
pie
and
apple
crisp
for
something
of
a
pumpkin
crisp
type
of
air
the
feel
was
also
highly
contributory
to
the
success
of
this
beer
as
it
stayed
light
and
sticky
enough
but
not
too
heavy
cloying
or
thick
for
something
so
spicy
and
flavorful
it
again
found
the
right
balance
which
seems
to
be
a
recurring
theme
with
each
component
we
assess
with
warmth
the
grain
also
reminded
us
more
belgian
styles
and
namely
the
tripel
with
the
hearty
malt
backing
to
be
raked
over
by
sweet
browned
banana
inclusions
this
is
a
fantastic
drink
and
certainly
the
big
surprise
sleeper
of
the
pumpkin
season
and
dare
we
say
a
smash
hit
in
our
books
o
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
pumpkin
beers
if
youre
into
the
pumpkin
beer
thing
the
smashed
pumpkin
is
a
must
it
pours
light
coppery
orange
color
with
an
aroma
fall
spices
the
pumkin
is
not
overbearing
and
it
is
very
smooth
odlike
liquified
pumpkin
pie
filling
diluted
with
vodka
that
was
harsh
but
i
am
not
a
giant
fan
of
this
beer
i
dont
like
pumpkinhead
much
but
this
could
be
close
to
as
bad
people
like
their
sweets
so
i
can
see
why
this
has
been
selling
out
all
over
the
place
nevertheless
it
works
really
well
for
me
in
small
portions
and
pumpkin
ice
cream
is
something
that
ive
definitely
had
before
and
enjoy
so
that
added
on
to
the
overall
experience
of
drinking
this
id
definitely
need
help
splitting
a
bottle
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
one
day
however
ill
have
the
opportunity
to
have
a
pumpkin
beer
that
focuses
far
more
on
the
vegetal
aspects
of
pumpkin
rather
than
merely
the
spices
and
sugars
that
compliment
it
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
october
pumpkin
beer
try
this
for
yourself
shipyard
smashed
pumpkin
pugslys
signature
series
3
55
o
decent
pumpkin
ale
only
wish
it
came
in
12oz
bottles
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ever
but
this
one
still
works
relatively
well
o
a
good
pumpkin
ale
i
would
drink
it
again
not
sure
about
buying
it
again
when
there
are
so
many
other
options
that
are
more
economical
glad
i
had
it
wont
be
hooked
on
it
poured
from
the
bomber
into
a
glass
it
has
copper
color
body
with
a
a
small
head
the
smell
has
some
pumpkin
notes
and
spices
the
taste
has
a
strong
spice
complexity
and
some
pumpkin
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
for
a
9
overall
is
a
good
beer
overall
the
beer
offers
good
complexity
to
allow
the
drinker
something
to
ponder
over
and
enjoy
it
shows
great
potential
i
think
in
the
future
i
would
cellar
this
veer
for
a
good
while
to
allow
some
of
the
alcohol
presence
to
settle
still
a
good
beer
o
a
nice
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
a
tad
unbalanced
but
nice
overall
this
is
one
i
would
drink
again
but
will
not
seek
out
shipyards
smashed
pumpkin
doesnt
evoke
the
sipping
nature
of
rich
and
dessertlike
beers
but
at
9
perhaps
it
should
but
because
of
its
final
hop
bitterness
and
turn
to
dryness
easily
masks
the
alcohol
and
gives
the
beer
a
dangerous
drinkability
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
one
of
the
better
ive
tried
i
feel
it
would
have
got
a
higher
score
if
the
aroma
would
have
been
better
but
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
for
the
type
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
decent
head
continually
rising
effervescence
and
some
persistent
lacing
nose
is
characteristic
pumpkin
and
fall
spices
bitter
and
pungent
woody
and
peaty
pumpkin
not
much
else
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
ocalling
this
a
pumpkin
beer
is
pushing
the
envelope
a
bit
it
is
a
good
tasting
beer
but
it
probably
is
not
what
youre
looking
for
if
you
want
that
classic
pumpkin
pie
flavor
it
has
a
strong
alcohol
flavor
which
might
be
a
bit
offputting
for
people
as
well
if
youre
looking
for
a
strong
malty
alcoholic
cinnamon
beer
this
is
right
on
the
line
seriously
if
you
are
into
something
like
cinnamon
whiskey
you
will
probably
enjoy
the
beer
for
that
aspect
alone
dont
expect
much
in
the
way
of
pumpkin
pie
though
o
a
wonderful
beer
great
flavor
really
puts
you
in
the
mood
for
fall
there
wasnt
much
aroma
or
i
would
have
scored
it
even
higher
will
definately
pick
up
again
just
opened
this
bottle
today
and
decided
to
pour
it
into
my
snifter
glass
first
impressions
wonderful
orange
amber
color
with
the
smell
of
a
fresh
baked
pumpkin
pie
the
added
pumpkin
and
little
spice
allow
for
a
wonderful
drinking
seasonal
ale
that
feels
like
silk
when
drinking
the
head
is
a
gorgious
thick
white
cap
that
hangs
around
especially
in
an
etched
bottom
glass
i
would
definately
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
looking
for
a
fall
beer
that
isnt
overly
sweet
to
drink
o
i
appreciate
spices
that
are
well
brewed
but
here
while
they
stay
true
to
their
tastes
they
need
to
be
brought
into
balance
with
everything
else
given
the
high
abv
as
well
id
rather
spend
my
time
with
something
else
o
its
good
im
not
going
to
fork
over
8
for
it
again
but
its
worth
a
try
at
least
once
their
regular
pumpkinhead
is
much
better
imo
and
a
lot
more
my
price
point
overall
pretty
disappointed
here
i
didnt
really
like
the
pumkinhead
but
i
was
holding
out
for
this
one
maybe
it
being
in
a
larger
bottle
fooled
me
when
next
year
rolls
around
ill
definitely
pick
around
this
pumpkin
ale
other
brews
are
much
better
in
my
opinion
o
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
a
little
too
much
spice
and
not
enough
pumpkin
deffinately
worth
a
try
this
beer
starts
off
rough
around
the
edges
but
everything
comes
together
the
more
you
drink
it
its
like
a
caramel
apple
in
a
bottle
major
props
for
not
coming
off
as
your
typical
imperial
pumpkin
ale
this
is
pretty
unique
and
i
like
it
for
that
its
much
better
than
my
score
might
indicate
recommended
o
shipyards
smashed
pumpkin
starts
with
a
somewhat
weak
aroma
but
quickly
becomes
rather
boastful
in
flavor
and
feel
bringing
smoothness
and
sweetness
together
with
pumpkin
and
spice
for
a
hefty
cool
fall
day
brew
bottle
shared
by
a
friend
pours
a
beautiful
clear
orange
with
very
small
white
head
aroma
is
big
pumpkin
and
a
bit
of
spice
actually
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beer
aromas
i
have
encountered
flavor
is
big
pumpkin
and
light
on
the
spice
i
like
it
that
way
the
pumpkin
flavor
really
shines
in
this
one
some
sweet
malt
on
the
back
end
that
lingers
and
plays
with
the
gourd
funk
slight
bitter
finish
easy
drinking
with
medium
carbonation
not
bad
bought
two
22oz
bottles
of
this
poured
a
beautiful
orange
into
a
mason
jar
the
smell
was
amazing
felt
like
it
was
thanksgiving
and
there
was
a
pumpkin
pie
in
the
oven
there
was
a
perfect
balance
of
pumpkin
spice
and
cinnamon
in
this
beer
to
make
it
really
enjoyable
while
also
making
sure
it
wasnt
too
overpowering
like
other
pumpkin
beers
the
pour
left
a
slightly
orange
head
overall
i
loved
this
beer
and
i
plan
on
buying
it
for
the
rest
of
the
fall
overalla
little
strange
to
be
drinking
in
august
but
come
october
when
the
temperatures
start
to
drop
and
yams
are
in
season
this
is
going
to
be
a
necessity
o
this
is
a
good
beer
above
average
unlike
some
beers
this
actually
seems
like
it
was
brewed
with
real
pumpkins
this
is
definitely
a
go
to
pumpkin
ale
mf
very
creamy
and
smooth
with
slight
carbonation
you
can
feel
the
heat
from
the
alcohol
as
you
drink
this
beer
in
the
finish
the
spices
like
to
stay
and
dance
around
your
mouth
o
personally
i
think
pumpkinhead
has
this
beat
but
not
horrible
is
give
it
a
flat
3
o
pretty
nice
not
overboard
with
the
spices
which
i
appreciate
overall
a
pretty
nice
imperial
pumpkin

o
delayed
trying
this
one
but
glad
i
did
find
a
bottle
in
january
the
last
one
on
the
shelf
the
manager
at
lcbo
said
he
was
going
to
buy
it
if
i
hadnt
that
night
not
disappointed
at
all
i
enjoy
the
weight
of
the
pumpkin
balance
of
sweetness
and
pumpkin
flavour
o
very
nice
beer
love
the
pumpkin
love
the
smell
had
a
few
of
these
in
my
day
i
would
say
very
nice
pumpkin
beer
i
will
continue
to
buy
o
a
pretty
decent
pumpkin
beer
but
not
one
if
the
better
imperials
i
would
take
pumpking
instead
any
time
not
something
you
would
like
to
drink
a
lot
of
in
one
sitting
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
pumpkin
taste
is
so
sweat
no
over
powering
no
bs
with
over
spicing
appearance
a
light
golden
brown
colour
even
on
smell
just
pumpkin
like
i
said
on
the
spice
only
a
light
taste
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
34
of
the
way
through
the
sip
cinnamon
nutmeg
cloves
i
am
blown
away
this
is
the
way
a
pumkin
beer
should
taste
the
balance
in
the
brew
is
amazing
overall
ugghh
tastes
quite
literally
like
a
pumpkin
cola
im
sorry
this
is
just
awful
if
theres
any
redeeming
value
its
that
it
does
well
to
hide
the
9
abv
but
thats
it
not
only
would
i
never
buy
it
again
id
care
to
never
see
it
on
shelves
again
maybe
the
worst
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
id
rather
have
a
bmc
than
this
dreck
i
dont
believe
much
in
drain
pours
but
this
ones
getting
serious
consideration
www
brewreviewboston
blogspot
com
overall
this
would
be
pretty
good
if
the
strong
alcohol
taste
didnt
gross
me
out
o
a
decent
beer
for
the
style
but
it
gets
lost
with
the
high
way
too
high
hop
addition
o
enjoyable
with
very
good
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
which
are
in
good
balance
with
one
another
easy
to
drink
because
the
beer
is
not
overly
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
in
the
taste
though
at
9
abv
this
is
very
much
a
sipping
beer
o
pretty
good
pumpkin
beers
are
not
generally
my
favorite
but
this
one
is
acceptable
wouldnt
seek
out
another
overall
great
pumpkin
ale
very
well
crafted
i
will
buy
this
one
again
for
sure
slightly
above
average
for
pumpkin
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
bad
for
a
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
bright
orange
coppery
color
with
a
small
tan
head
into
a
snifter
the
smell
is
strong
pumpkin
pie
with
lots
of
spices
big
sugary
sweetness
going
on
in
this
one
with
a
good
nutmeg
cinnamon
pumpkin
taste
over
all
its
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
overall
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
not
a
sugar
bomb
and
it
really
seems
like
there
is
actual
pumpkin
here
not
just
tons
of
spices
perfectly
balanced
and
drinkable
at
9
with
just
a
slight
pleasant
warming
a
wonderful
fall
beer
that
everyone
should
seek
out
i
wouldnt
drink
another
one
but
it
isnt
all
that
bad
i
think
they
did
a
decent
job
of
putting
a
pumpkin
in
a
beer
i
can
feel
my
head
warming
up
overall
damn
good
pumpkin
beer
top
five
for
sure
overall
lighter
body
ciderlike
consistency
not
only
a
pumpkin
beer
a
very
good
fall
seasonal
o
great
pumpkin
beer
if
lightly
artificial
andor
heavyhanded
recommended
appearance
in
a
very
nice
amber
with
a
good
head
at
pour
head
remains
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
but
mostly
disappates
over
time
to
a
thin
rings
round
the
edge
of
the
glass
smells
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
other
spices
strong
and
almost
a
hint
of
sour
sour
disappears
in
the
taste
and
overwhelmed
with
pumpkin
and
heavy
malts
this
beer
is
sweet
in
flavor
maybe
a
molasses
or
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
is
great
thick
enough
to
meet
the
expectations
of
the
type
but
equally
easy
drinking
the
allspice
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
though
not
detrimentally
kind
of
just
reminding
you
what
youre
drinking
a
damn
good
time
if
your
looking
for
the
pied
version
of
a
pumpkin
ale
thank
you
pugsley
o
this
is
a
great
easy
to
find
pumpkin
beer
i
definitely
drikn
it
a
lot
when
i
want
a
pumpkin
beer
i
recommend
it
if
you
like
pumpkin
beer
overall
the
off
flavor
and
lackluster
aroma
keep
this
beer
down
nice
pumpkin
flavor
and
very
refreshing
this
is
one
of
shipyards
best
however
i
would
recommend
a
handful
of
imperial
pumpkin
ales
over
this
one
wachusetts
imperial
pumpkin
and
southern
tiers
pumking
are
2
examples
but
give
it
a
shot
i
always
root
hard
for
new
england
breweries
3
5
d
tasty
pumpkin
brew
worth
a
try
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
a
clean
poor
with
a
nice
head
revealed
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
avoiding
the
usual
problem
of
being
too
sweet
and
too
pumpkiny
shipyards
beer
enjoyed
a
nice
fall
aroma
with
crip
pumpkin
and
spice
smells
mouthfeel
was
uneven
at
times
the
beer
seemed
a
little
thin
while
others
it
seemed
to
have
more
body
too
it
at
the
right
price
this
could
be
a
nice
beer
to
pair
with
certain
fall
flavored
pasta
dishes
its
a
pretty
good
beer
and
with
the
high
abv
both
a
sipper
and
something
youll
enjoy
in
the
cooler
months
as
it
warms
the
beer
actually
gets
a
bit
worse
that
said
its
still
better
than
a
lot
of
other
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
and
is
something
id
enjoy
having
more
of
o
a
very
decent
pumpkin
beer
it
is
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
but
the
flavors
are
good
and
well
balanced
and
they
didnt
go
overboard
with
the
spices
i
have
to
agree
that
the
wheat
malt
didnt
add
much
of
anything
except
to
make
this
thinner
and
i
suppose
more
drinkable
but
at
9
and
at
just
a
hair
under
8
bucks
at
the
lcbo
im
looking
for
something
to
savour
not
to
drown
myself
in
still
i
maintain
my
aboveaverage
rating
and
if
pumking
or
the
other
bigguns
arent
coming
ontario
way
this
year
this
will
certainly
suffice
for
halloween
drinking
d
this
is
an
excellent
pumpkin
ale
my
only
two
real
complaints
at
that
the
flavors
are
ever
so
slightly
artificialcloying
and
the
cheap
foil
used
on
the
cap
other
than
that
this
one
is
very
good
to
excellent
in
all
facets
i
really
enjoyed
this
take
to
at
reproducing
actual
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
the
9
abv
is
well
hidden
note
pumpkin
ales
are
not
for
me
so
it
is
a
bit
negatively
biased
but
still
scores
well
over
others
that
i
have
had
m
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
fairly
dry
from
the
wheat
and
higher
alcohol
finish
is
clean
with
only
a
hint
of
lingering
sugary
tartness
o
just
not
enough
character
for
a
beer
this
big
its
just
too
bland
and
vague
its
like
they
wanted
to
make
it
approachable
wrong
tactic
for
11
a
bomber
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
flavor
they
should
through
out
the
wheat
and
munich
and
replace
them
with
amber
malt
and
a
good
english
crystal
maybe
a
bit
higher
mash
rest
or
a
less
attenuative
ale
yeast
a
good
english
strain
would
really
help
with
the
over
all
body
and
flavor
just
too
plain
for
the
style
and
the
price
overall
i
would
say
its
fairly
decent
i
did
enjoy
it
and
have
in
the
past
quite
a
few
times
not
my
favourite
pumpkin
ale
but
one
that
i
have
purchased
on
more
than
one
occasion
and
always
enjoyed
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
out
there
in
my
opinion
in
a
total
juxtaposition
to
their
pumpkin
head
this
beer
features
the
squash
over
the
spice
and
is
one
of
my
favorites
right
now
it
pours
a
fairly
dense
looking
orange
color
more
spring
than
fall
in
hue
with
a
two
inch
white
head
on
top
almost
nitro
in
appearance
smells
like
fresh
pumpkins
maybe
stewed
pumpkin
and
with
a
spice
thats
a
product
ofn
the
yeast
not
a
product
of
too
much
nutmeg
in
the
brew
kettle
the
flavor
is
equally
chill
on
the
spice
front
but
pungent
on
the
earthy
vegetable
front
some
notes
of
vanilla
and
candy
in
there
too
but
this
isnt
a
sweet
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
huge
full
bodied
but
relatively
easy
drinking
i
think
its
maybe
not
so
easy
drinking
just
so
interesting
and
delicious
that
i
keep
putting
these
down
the
alcohol
is
present
but
its
complementary
to
whats
going
on
not
a
distraction
this
a
an
absolutely
essential
beer
to
try
this
fall
i
might
go
get
another
one
right
now
actually
overall
i
have
to
say
my
second
favorite
pumpkin
beer
my
first
is
pumking
by
southern
tier
but
this
beer
definitely
hangs
up
there
up
rare
i
mention
another
brew
to
compare
it
to
but
just
to
let
you
know
you
are
not
drinking
bullsht
try
it
for
yourself
and
love
it
salud
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
and
one
of
the
few
that
showcases
the
actual
pumpkin
rather
than
pumpkin
pie
spices
at
first
the
high
abv
isnt
apparent
at
all
and
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
9
as
the
beer
warms
though
the
alcohol
becomes
much
more
apparent
and
takes
a
little
bit
away
from
the
overall
flavor
id
also
like
to
see
a
little
better
head
retention
and
some
lacing
to
go
along
with
all
that
carbonation
thats
there
right
after
opening
still
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
much
much
better
than
that
other
pumpkin
beer
that
shipyard
makes
overall
this
is
strange
it
tastes
more
like
a
spicy
cinnamon
beer
than
a
pumpkin
beer
trending
toward
mouthwash
its
no
secret
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
i
wasnt
impressed
with
the
appearance
and
the
smell
of
this
beer
but
the
taste
and
abv
redeemed
it
the
pumpkin
spice
shines
through
nicely
with
minimal
cheap
maltiness
not
a
bad
attempt
o
pretty
good
its
really
like
drinking
pumpkin
pie
and
the
flavors
are
great
pretty
drinkable
but
these
beers
arent
quite
made
for
sessioning
especially
one
at
9
abv
much
thinner
body
then
expected
lower
amounts
of
carbonation
lots
of
pumpkin
flavor
though
semisweet
yet
squash
like
pumpkin
flavor
up
front
with
faint
pumpkin
pies
spices
to
balance
oddly
simply
for
such
a
big
beer
as
well
one
of
the
few
pumpkin
beers
where
the
pumpkin
and
not
the
spice
is
the
star
of
the
show
however
unlike
sam
adams
fat
jack
its
not
just
an
overload
of
pumpkin
flavor
spiced
just
enough
to
balance
pretty
unique
pumpkin
beer
to
be
honest
doesnt
try
to
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
like
most
lets
the
pumpkin
shine
through
while
still
being
beer
enough
to
incorporate
good
balance
and
flavor
impressive
again
doesnt
drink
like
a
9
beer
flavor
wise
body
wise
or
alcohol
wise
very
mysterious
so
much
better
that
the
shipyard
pumpkin
ale
the
color
was
yelloworange
with
an
average
amount
of
foam
and
lace
the
smell
of
spices
was
very
much
evident
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
was
well
balanced
between
spices
malts
hops
etc
a
very
pleasant
surprise
with
a
soft
tasty
well
balanced
pumpkin
ale
o
this
ranks
as
my
number
2
pumpkin
beer
beating
out
schlafly
and
weyerbacher
still
no
southern
tier
pumking
but
damn
close
o
this
was
very
pumpkin
and
spice
forward
as
it
warmed
i
got
some
darker
fruit
flavors
spice
and
alcohol
decent
but
i
prefer
the
pumking
i
had
a
few
days
ago
served
from
a
bottle
into
glass
not
a
very
impressive
pumpkin
beer
considering
some
of
the
other
beers
in
the
style
i
dont
really
see
any
reason
to
purchase
this
one
over
the
others
very
subtle
pumpkin
notes
too
subtle
and
a
bitter
finish
no
problem
finishing
the
bottle
but
next
time
im
going
with
a
pumpking
other
than
that
a
fantastic
brew
wouldnt
make
the
spices
appear
more
in
the
flavor
the
pumpkin
flavor
hits
right
up
front
with
the
nutmeg
and
allspice
flavors
the
beer
is
sweet
and
has
a
touch
of
alcohol
flavor
the
feel
is
mediumheavy
and
a
bit
syrupy
there
are
nice
flavors
but
the
finish
might
be
a
touch
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
i
would
like
it
more
if
it
were
a
bit
drier
that
being
said
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
they
are
nice
people
who
responded
to
questions
but
when
you
limit
a
brew
to
a
specific
area
no
one
can
queston
how
good
it
is
unless
you
go
there
beer
is
subjective
guess
what
iron
city
amber
from
pittsburgh
is
pretty
good
original
review
on
08242010
o
maybe
the
weirdest
pumpkin
ale
ive
tried
so
far
with
the
yeast
playing
a
major
role
thats
ok
because
i
honestly
find
pumpkin
ales
struggling
for
palatable
flavours
the
pumpkin
is
usually
too
gourdy
and
subtle
so
breweries
depend
on
spice
bombs
or
worse
diacetyl
bombs
this
is
a
refreshing
take
and
it
was
executed
quite
well
pretty
atypical
flavor
for
pumpkin
i
dont
think
i
kept
it
oo
long
or
suspect
any
mishandling
nonetheless
it
was
tasty
fun
to
pick
apart
id
call
it
more
a
full
beer
than
pumpkin
overall
good
wellbalanced
warming
beer
but
not
really
delivering
the
pumpkin
flavour
expected
out
of
a
bomber
bottle
this
beer
was
a
perfectly
clear
orange
color
with
a
small
amount
of
rising
carbonation
the
head
was
a
skimp
halffinger
of
beige
bubbles
that
quickly
dissipated
to
a
tiny
collar
the
aroma
was
mostly
of
sweet
malts
some
generic
citrus
a
light
note
of
spices
and
of
course
subdued
pumpkin
the
flavors
were
much
better
than
the
aroma
heavily
spiced
with
lots
of
vanilla
cloves
cinnamon
coriander
orange
and
nutmeg
but
it
was
definitely
punchy
and
the
booze
did
interfere
with
the
pumpkin
element
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
low
o
theres
not
much
pumpkin
going
on
in
this
but
a
whole
lot
of
allspice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
o
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
and
rank
among
my
favorites
in
the
category
though
i
have
probably
had
less
than
10
so
take
that
for
what
its
worth
pours
light
amber
with
full
inch
of
white
foam
light
pumpkin
smell
brown
sugar
too
and
nutmeg
mild
pumpkin
taste
some
light
sour
notes
heavy
cinammon
and
nutmeg
firm
hop
really
smooth
and
balanced
with
a
full
pumpkin
flavor
spices
dont
overwhelm
really
good
better
than
the
shipyard
pumpkinhead
for
sure
o
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
year
very
much
a
sleeper
o
this
beer
wasnt
too
bad
but
not
a
must
have
for
me
the
taste
improves
as
the
beer
warms
but
was
still
a
bit
too
boozy
and
lacked
a
strong
showing
of
pumpkin
and
spices
in
the
end
i
was
glad
to
get
to
try
this
but
will
have
to
look
elsewhere
to
get
my
fill
of
pumpkin
flavor
drinkability
its
a
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
solid
take
on
the
style
with
some
unfortunate
drops
in
the
smell
department
but
the
taste
matters
most
and
smashed
pumpkin
is
good
memorable
and
one
id
very
much
go
for
again
in
conclusion
by
third
stop
on
the
pumpkin
brew
trail
has
been
a
very
nice
stop
the
shipyard
smashed
pumpkin
is
a
pumpkindominated
bigboy
beer
for
the
folks
that
really
love
pumpkin
beer
like
me
its
a
little
sweet
relatively
easy
drinking
and
a
pretty
good
representation
of
pumpkin
beer
if
you
see
one
on
the
shelf
give
it
a
try
o
i
love
the
smashed
series
im
a
bit
overwhelmed
by
this
brew
a
bit
too
spicy
im
super
pumped
some
shipyard
brews
have
started
being
distributed
to
co
thanks
for
a
spicy
brew
andyavalanche
bright
orange
hue
modest
white
head
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
wet
wood
make
up
the
nose
flavors
are
not
good
taste
like
pumpkin
cologne
spices
are
a
bit
heavy
the
alcohol
come
through
quite
a
bit
too
light
body
this
one
is
not
any
better
than
the
abomination
known
as
pumpkin
head
overall
a
nice
beer
that
wasnt
overly
sweet
like
some
of
the
other
stronger
pumpkin
beers
it
does
pack
quite
a
spicy
punch
though
happy
i
gave
it
a
try
but
wouldnt
seek
out
again
merry
xmas
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
in
future
years
as
it
hold
promise
p
stellar
pairings
with
dark
meat
turkey
and
stuffing
the
alcohol
cuts
through
the
richness
of
the
turkey
and
the
pumpkin
hooks
up
with
the
rich
breadiness
of
the
stuffing
and
doesnt
let
go
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
was
not
very
good
o
a
very
solid
pumpkin
beer
good
flavors
overall
an
overspiced
and
out
of
balance
pumpkin
ale
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
try
it
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
i
dont
think
it
deserves
some
of
the
low
scores
that
i
see
on
here
i
would
recommend
trying
it
o
better
than
their
pumpkinhead
but
i
am
still
not
a
fan
the
sour
flavor
that
i
despised
in
the
other
beer
shows
up
in
this
one
as
well
though
not
as
heavy
still
drinkable
but
needs
much
improvement
when
there
are
so
many
better
alternatives
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
some
obvious
carbonation
in
four
words
booze
meets
pumpkin
beer
its
lightly
bodied
with
a
pumpkinpumpkin
spice
flavor
it
has
a
sweet
malty
finish
on
whats
a
big
boozy
beer
im
left
wondering
how
it
would
develop
with
some
age
on
it
i
dont
understand
the
fs
and
ds
this
gets
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
id
put
it
up
there
with
punkin
and
pumking
d
balance
makes
this
one
work
candy
sweetness
on
the
one
side
and
spice
gourd
booze
on
the
other
very
much
a
sipper
and
a
dessert
beer
incredibly
better
than
pumpkin
head
o
this
beer
is
hilariously
buttery
i
cant
even
fathom
why
it
has
a
b
average
i
actually
made
pumpkin
beer
bread
with
the
remainder
and
in
lieu
of
the
butter
and
spice
requirement
i
threw
in
this
beer
the
bread
turned
out
horrible
o
its
an
ok
beer
but
i
think
there
is
way
to
much
alcohol
taste
to
it
needs
to
tone
it
back
on
the
alcohol
and
step
up
more
pumpkin
flavor
pours
a
clear
light
copperorange
with
a
thin
white
head
the
scent
is
very
spice
heavy
nutmeg
very
autumnal
scent
and
sweet
the
flavor
is
very
strong
spiced
very
sweet
almost
like
a
pumpkin
candy
liquified
filling
and
warming
to
drink
smooth
mouthfeel
its
a
little
on
the
candied
side
but
enjoyable
for
a
pumpkin
ale
with
high
abv
kind
of
a
remnant
of
like
you
got
home
late
for
dinner
and
you
smell
the
pumpkin
pie
being
served
and
when
you
get
in
the
dining
room
someone
is
shovelling
the
very
last
piece
down
on
tap
at
burger
in
santa
cruz
pours
a
tangerine
gold
with
a
wimpy
white
head
smells
and
tastes
like
dirty
cinnamon
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
vague
pumpkinness
tart
and
slightly
acidic
overspiced
especially
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
sweetish
dirty
mineral
finish
just
what
youd
expect
from
shipyard
a
good
tasting
pumpkin
ale
not
a
whole
lot
of
pumpkin
but
it
is
there
and
theres
also
a
nice
hop
character
too
2010
sweeter
with
more
pronounced
pumpkin
and
a
noticeable
bready
malt
flavour
that
was
not
evident
at
all
in
the
11
no
hop
bite
at
all
as
was
evident
in
the
finish
in
the
11
overall
this
is
a
weird
beer
in
general
there
is
a
tartness
that
clashes
with
everything
else
not
really
picking
up
much
pumpkin
or
spice
i
wouldnt
have
another
i
take
my
hat
off
for
mr
pugsley
of
shipyard
brewing
this
is
an
excellent
rich
and
enjoyable
strong
pumpkin
ale
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
but
nothing
exceptional
a
little
disappointed
too
sweet
strange
cider
qualities
and
too
high
in
ethanol
to
really
make
me
consider
this
one
again
a
pleasant
surprise
and
definitely
a
beer
ill
seek
again
i
really
like
this
beer
and
id
rate
the
taste
a
notch
higher
if
the
booze
was
buried
a
little
more
however
it
is
nice
to
have
a
pumpkin
seasonal
around
with
a
kick
o
this
tastes
like
a
somewhat
better
but
still
not
very
good
version
of
their
pumpkinhead
it
still
smells
and
tastes
like
a
chemical
cleaner
if
not
for
the
high
alcohol
shipyard
smashed
pumpkin
would
be
a
good
example
of
the
style
for
people
to
cut
their
teeth
on
what
it
lacks
a
little
in
character
it
makes
up
for
in
drinkability
what
it
lacks
in
malt
it
makes
up
for
in
spicing
in
other
words
its
a
serviceable
ale
that
might
disappoint
aficionados
but
will
very
much
appeal
to
newbies
out
there
overall
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
overall
full
flavored
and
well
balanced
not
the
best
pump
beer
this
fall
thats
probably
cambridge
brewing
companys
great
pumpkin
ale
also
at
8
99
a
bomber
id
much
much
rather
take
one
of
the
following
cbc
great
pump
6pack
smutty
pump
4
pack
dfh
punkin
all
priced
lower
that
being
said
i
dont
think
shipyard
gets
a
fair
shake
on
ba
not
bad
at
all
pugsley
now
get
rid
of
that
pumpkin
head
stuff
and
put
this
in
affordable
12
packs
a
well
built
pumpkin
beer
that
alludes
to
pumpkin
pie
spices
without
overwhelming
the
palette
honestly
id
like
to
see
even
a
little
more
pumpkin
character
though
clearly
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
much
preferred
treat
or
even
dfh
punkin
overall
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
just
under
good
gourd
o
i
like
it
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
but
towards
the
top
somewhere
i
feel
like
this
had
very
quadlike
components
as
a
base
beer
which
added
a
nice
complexity
would
definitely
drink
again
bottle
poured
a
lightly
hazy
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
consists
of
light
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
solid
caramel
notes
taste
is
dominated
by
some
solid
malt
backbone
with
a
semisweet
touch
of
caramel
which
is
very
well
balanced
by
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
easily
drinkable
with
nice
balance
and
alcohol
isnt
apparent
though
can
be
somewhat
dangerous
considering
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
beer
i
have
tried
form
this
brewery
im
not
wild
about
the
cider
stuff
going
on
here
but
im
glad
i
bought
this
beer
even
though
it
was
8
99
for
one
bottle
this
may
be
the
9
abv
talking
here
taste
is
a
clear
and
clean
pumkin
skin
and
meat
with
pumkin
pie
spices
and
a
little
caramel
the
middle
warms
up
the
pumkin
flavor
and
showas
off
some
toasted
bready
caramel
malts
the
finish
is
smooth
warm
and
atringent
the
9
abv
leaves
a
little
twinge
to
the
palate
on
the
finish
and
linger
o
a
good
beer
but
maybe
not
worth
the
price
tag
id
love
it
for
4
taste
sweet
then
bitter
but
always
boozy
if
you
want
to
hit
the
pumpkin
patch
for
10
bucks
a
bomber
there
are
much
better
places
to
go
4
oz
sample
poured
on
draft
pours
a
light
amber
hue
nose
is
very
subdued
nearly
nonexistent
the
taste
is
weird
i
feel
like
im
drinking
the
syrup
from
a
jar
of
maraschino
cherries
wtf
strangely
enough
this
is
one
of
very
few
pumkin
beers
where
i
can
taste
pumpkin
thats
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
sweet
that
cherry
taste
persists
throughout
overall
this
is
just
a
strange
beer
dont
know
what
they
were
going
for
here
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
its
price
and
lack
of
pazazz
i
do
not
think
i
will
be
revisiting
this
d
drinkability
is
quite
good
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
but
its
more
warming
than
anything
else
o
overall
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
ale
better
for
the
holidays
paired
with
some
thanksgiving
or
pumpkin
pie
on
a
cold
night
for
dessert
good
drinker
but
a
little
too
expensive
8
99
to
be
a
good
drinker
whats
with
the
damn
twist
off
bottle
i
was
hoping
to
keep
this
bottle
for
homebrew
pours
a
clean
and
bright
orange
color
with
modest
head
and
little
lacing
scent
is
lead
by
sweet
malts
and
slightly
heavy
spicing
pumpkin
pie
appears
in
the
back
end
with
a
bit
of
leafy
hops
and
alcohol
on
the
nose
taste
leads
with
a
bitter
push
of
hoping
and
seasonal
spices
sweet
malt
and
pumpkin
pie
make
an
appearance
in
the
mid
finishes
with
odd
bitter
herbal
metallic
note
with
noticeable
alcohol
disappointingly
thin
and
over
bubbly
i
may
actually
prefer
the
regular
old
shipyard
pumpkin
to
this
beast
the
label
is
very
cool
it
alone
is
enough
to
convince
me
to
buy
it
very
nice
work
o
a
tasty
pumpkin
ale
and
worth
taking
for
a
spin
ive
had
some
better
pumpkin
ales
but
this
one
is
still
well
represented
and
at
9
its
well
worth
a
try
all
in
all
this
beer
is
a
clusterfuck
of
extremes
that
dont
work
well
together
at
all
shipyards
next
destination
should
be
the
drawing
board
d
nothing
to
really
write
home
about
but
a
good
beer
none
the
less
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
pumpkin
beer
and
i
can
easily
drink
a
few
glasses
of
it
i
thought
the
sweetness
and
spice
balanced
each
other
out
pretty
well
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
rather
nice
beer
i
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
id
buy
it
again
o
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
which
would
leave
me
to
believe
i
didnt
get
enough
pumpkin
in
my
bottle
if
i
had
a
choice
i
would
stick
to
the
smashed
blueberry
d
alright
beer
could
have
used
more
nose
to
entice
my
senses
i
actually
got
real
excited
about
this
beer
and
was
let
down
after
taking
a
deepdeep
whiff
of
nothing
way
more
taste
than
scent
to
this
beer
aroma
of
nutmeg
and
other
spices
pours
a
deep
orange
with
tan
head
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
ive
tried
something
pumking
is
just
too
much
for
me
to
even
finish
a
full
glass
blast
of
nutmeg
some
cinnamon
and
a
tinge
of
pumpkin
which
is
perfect
for
me
almost
belgiany
on
the
palette
loved
it
o
not
a
fan
it
doesnt
feel
terribly
well
balanced
and
the
malt
sweetness
is
too
over
the
top
for
me
the
fruity
alcohol
feels
out
of
place
and
it
feels
under
carbonated
easy
to
drink
ok
beer
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
not
to
be
confused
with
the
dreaded
pumpkinhead
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
recommended
poured
from
a
bomber
with
no
freshness
date
poured
to
out
bright
vibrant
orange
lots
of
pumpkin
flavor
hides
the
boozes
well
the
pumpkin
flavor
comes
first
before
the
spice
spices
are
a
lil
mute
and
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
rather
smooth
overall
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
edit
i
would
add
that
this
improves
quite
a
bit
given
a
chance
to
warm
grain
and
ginger
settles
down
a
bit
score
stands
o
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
it
is
a
spicy
tasty
treat
as
often
is
the
case
with
pumpkin
ales
the
spices
are
more
prominent
than
the
pumpkin
but
a
delicious
fall
treat
none
the
less
drinkability
one
of
the
better
new
england
pumpkin
brews
and
light
years
ahead
of
pumpkinhead
i
like
the
vanilla
tastes
and
the
complexity
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
pumpking
minus
the
hoppiness
i
will
revisit
this
next
year
o
a
very
nice
brew
not
pumking
but
definitely
worth
buying
again
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
into
a
st
bernardus
goblet
i
poured
straight
into
the
bottom
of
the
glass
with
a
bit
of
umph
to
try
to
coax
a
nice
head
on
the
beer
to
no
avail
a
think
white
head
was
all
i
could
get
aromas
of
sweet
cinnamon
almost
like
red
hot
candies
plus
some
nutmeg
and
cooked
pumpkin
cinnamon
is
dominant
on
the
palate
a
decent
sweetness
and
just
a
bit
of
pumpkin
flavor
the
higher
alcohol
makes
itself
known
as
well
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
creamy
carbonated
mouthfeel
overall
definitely
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
but
not
bad
especially
for
what
i
paid
2
99
a
bomber
i
might
buy
a
couple
more
and
cellar
as
the
bros
suggested
o
somewhat
disappointed
by
this
one
i
had
high
expectations
and
it
just
did
not
meet
them
not
enough
pumpkin
flavor
too
heavy
on
the
ginger
and
nutmeg
mouthfeel
was
lacking
still
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
if
you
like
pumpkinhead
odds
are
that
youll
love
this
as
ive
said
throughout
the
review
im
not
a
pumpkinhead
fan
but
i
still
think
this
is
pretty
decent
ive
had
much
better
pumpkin
ales
but
this
is
by
no
means
awful
im
not
sure
ill
get
it
again
but
i
have
no
regrets
about
the
bottle
i
bought
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
pumpkin
beers
another
hooplahsurrounded
pumpkin
beer
so
you
know
ive
gotta
try
it
you
know
me
so
well
it
pours
a
clear
copper
topped
by
a
finger
of
offcreamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
brown
sugar
toasted
caramel
clove
vanilla
white
bread
and
a
strange
whiff
of
menthollike
alcohol
bubbling
up
from
the
bottom
this
last
part
really
keeps
me
from
enjoying
the
smell
the
taste
follows
pretty
closely
though
there
is
definitely
some
pumpkin
going
on
in
there
now
and
unfortunately
the
alcohol
now
resembles
strident
rubber
cement
wow
not
sure
what
that
is
but
it
is
just
awful
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
slick
feel
overall
either
something
aint
right
here
or
this
beer
is
just
plain
bad
either
way
i
did
not
enjoy
myself
here
o
im
so
used
to
pumpkin
beers
really
just
being
all
allspice
mixed
with
heavy
syrupy
flavor
this
really
takes
the
other
creamy
side
really
focusing
on
the
side
of
the
pumpkinmelon
taste
overall
not
bad
i
want
more
aroma
but
a
good
beer
for
a
pumpkin
beer
and
for
the
holidays
do
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
id
advise
passing
many
other
pumpkin
beers
out
there
that
id
recommended
buying
o
decent
pumpkin
beer
i
had
it
before
the
southern
tier
pumking
and
i
thought
that
one
was
better
and
the
price
was
better
overall
the
regular
shipyard
pumpkin
is
bunk
this
stuff
is
the
real
deal
enough
flavor
but
not
over
the
top
with
the
spices
enough
abv
for
this
time
of
year
but
not
too
much
where
it
is
a
struggle
to
get
this
down
smooth
and
refreshing
but
big
as
well
well
done
cheers
overall
i
dont
think
you
could
want
much
more
out
of
a
pumpkin
beer
the
only
drawback
is
that
the
alcohol
clouds
some
of
the
initial
flavor
until
the
astringency
wears
off
overall
i
liked
this
better
than
other
high
abv
pumpkins
better
rounded
than
pumpking
imo
o
a
pretty
nice
take
on
the
style
all
of
the
traditional
pumpkintype
flavours
are
present
and
are
reasonably
balanced
i
found
the
abv
to
detract
a
bit
from
the
overall
experience
came
across
as
a
bit
hot
without
the
flavour
punch
to
back
it
up
o
rank
top
5
on
my
pumpkin
beers
much
better
than
the
pumpkinhead
which
is
comparable
to
and
i
was
mistaken
for
a
pumpkin
cider
definately
amazing
compared
to
pumpkinhead
lol
bottle

nicely

alcohol
barely
noticeable
had
no
problem
finishing
the
bomber
myself
and
for
a
few
buck
less
than
pumking
i
will
grab
a
couple
more
while
its
still
around
i
think
its
between
this
and
dfhs
punkin
ale
for
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
so
far
this
year
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
into
balanced
pumpkin
beers
very
good
one
of
the
more
balanced
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
tried
and
the
warming
effect
is
most
definitely
welcome
this
is
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
on
the
market
pretty
good
enjoyable
brew
warms
a
bit
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
gulper
and
worth
seeking
out
when
its
in
season
overall
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
which
is
slightly
high
praise
because
ive
never
been
much
of
a
fan
of
the
style
good
seasonal
sipper
nose
is
pleasant
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
light
caramel
and
a
hint
of
graham
cracker
flavor
is
muted
on
the
pumpkin
unlike
many
pumpkin
beers
light
a
strong
golden
ale
with
pumpkin
perhaps
quite
a
spicy
character
from
the
hops
which
also
lend
a
bittering
finish
plenty
of
hops
in
this
one
slightly
fruity
booze
present
there
as
well
medium
sweet
body
pretty
lively
carbonation
a
big
beer
for
sure
pumpkin
is
not
in
your
face
balanced
but
still
festive
if
it
werent
for
the
obvious
booze
here
this
could
be
a
really
fine
example
of
how
to
make
a
pumpkin
beer
without
being
pie
in
a
glass
interesting
take
on
the
style
but
make
no
mistake
this
one
is
hot
d
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
punch
in
the
face
from
the
pumpkin
but
this
is
pretty
manageable
especially
considering
the
9abv
definitely
flavorful
and
drinkable
just
saying
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
pumpkin
bomb
than
what
is
in
my
glass
o
i
had
this
a
couple
years
ago
and
thought
it
was
awesome
but
upon
trying
it
again
i
am
severely
disappointed
i
dont
know
if
they
changed
the
recipe
or
what
but
this
just
wasnt
that
good
overall
this
bottle
tasted
absolutely
nothing
like
the
ones
that
i
had
last
year
i
did
not
detect
a
hint
of
the
pumpkin
spice
aroma
or
taste
that
id
come
to
expect
had
a
distinctive
orange
creamsickle
aromataste
to
it
not
bad
but
something
was
definitely
off
every
autumn
im
good
for
about
three
pumpkin
beers
before
i
want
to
vomit
because
i
hate
them
so
much
so
im
glad
i
started
with
this
one
its
one
of
the
better
that
i
have
ever
had
overall
a
little
disappointing
it
did
get
a
little
bettermore
drinkable
about
half
way
through
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
this
up
again
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazed
orangeyellow
coloring
with
a
fairly
substantial
two
inch
white
foamy
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
thin
low
profile
head
the
nose
is
a
complex
blend
of
wheat
and
slight
citrus
sweetness
with
pumpkin
and
spice
highlights
the
spice
nose
is
heavy
in
cinnamon
when
you
get
down
in
there
and
even
more
so
as
the
beer
warms
flavors
are
toasted
grain
and
bready
background
with
the
cinnamon
present
again
also
some
nutmeg
spicing
that
helps
to
balance
the
pumpkin
richness
that
finds
its
way
onto
the
palate
midway
through
the
taste
the
rich
flavors
stay
through
the
aftertaste
but
the
beer
remains
light
bodied
which
keeps
it
from
being
overpowering
very
decent
cling
to
the
glass
the
finish
is
quick
and
clean
and
the
increased
abv
doesnt
really
present
itself
past
the
bodymouthfeel
very
tasty
interesting
brew
the
label
recommends
mixing
with
blue
fin
which
is
their
stout
i
think
that
may
be
worth
a
try
t
candi
sugar
big
sweet
malts
and
a
lot
of
raisin
if
i
hadnt
known
this
was
a
pumpkin
ale
i
would
have
assumed
it
was
a
barleywine
or
a
grand
cru
from
the
taste
a
little
too
boozy
for
any
hint
of
pumpkin
to
come
through
pours
a
dark
golden
orange
colour
smells
of
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
pie
the
taste
follows
suit
although
it
doesnt
follow
as
the
smell
would
suggest
considering
the
high
percentage
though
its
quite
drinkable
just
the
overall
flavour
could
use
a
little
more
pumpkin
touch
decent
beer
o
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
but
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
pumpkin
ale
to
me
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
and
they
were
definitely
not
met
a
disappointment
for
me
i
suppose
for
those
who
are
looking
for
more
pumpkin
and
less
pie
this
might
be
a
good
choice
but
it
still
has
some
off
flavours
going
on
that
do
not
work
for
me
for
strong
pumpkin
ales
i
will
be
sticking
with
pumking
thank
you
very
much
o
this
was
an
eminently
enjoyable
drink
i
would
buy
it
throughout
the
year
if
it
were
available
overall
i
like
this
im
happy
to
see
that
shipyard
can
make
a
good
pumpkin
brew
and
would
always
pick
this
one
over
pumpkinhead
o
overall
this
tastes
like
a
sweet
pumpkin
ale
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
too
tastes
like
october
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
styles
i
could
find
at
the
store
it
wasnt
what
i
was
looking
for
i
would
like
a
more
dessert
beer
but
you
cant
fault
this
beer
for
something
that
it
doesnt
try
to
succeed
at
my
failed
expectations
aside
its
more
than
a
session
beer
but
would
go
well
with
light
dishes
its
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
imo
this
beer
was
strong
but
very
good
if
i
was
expecting
shipyard
pumpkinhead
then
i
would
have
been
very
very
disipointed
but
i
was
expecting
it
and
was
ready
for
the
malty
goodness
with
a
hint
of
cinnmin
nutmeg
brownsugar
notes
thank
you
shipyard
for
putting
out
another
great
beer
mfo
good
feel
to
this
one
pretty
thick
alcohol
is
hidden
well
but
warms
this
is
not
a
good
example
of
a
pumpkin
beer
at
all
in
fact
this
is
the
second
worst
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
aside
from
shipyards
regular
pumpkin
ale
there
are
much
better
examples
out
there
overall
a
strong
balance
brought
in
a
surprisingly
quaffable
beer
thoroughly
impressed
new
contender
for
one
of
the
top
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
gonna
have
to
pickup
a
few
more
bombers
before
and
after
october
31
ontap
at
alewitch
the
brew
pours
a
translucent
brassy
gold
hue
and
has
a
wispy
white
head
atop
the
flavor
and
aroma
suggest
all
things
deliciously
autumnal
from
pumpkin
pie
and
candy
corn
to
mulled
cider
and
applesauce
the
feel
is
a
bit
thin
and
that
is
my
major
complaint
but
that
is
nitpicking
as
the
feel
is
still
fairly
good
this
is
at
least
the
cadillac
of
pumpkin
brew
though
i
imagine
it
falls
short
of
pumpkin
rollsroyce
status
o
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
the
regular
shipyard
pumpkin
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
but
this
disappointed
i
tried
sip
after
sip
to
see
if
it
would
grow
on
me
or
mellow
out
as
it
warmed
but
i
could
not
get
over
that
vegetal
raw
rind
flavor
id
get
this
one
again
definitely
add
to
my
fall
lineup
m
d
medium
bodied
a
little
bit
of
weight
that
clings
to
the
tongue
alcohol
is
modest
adding
just
a
little
note
of
added
spiciness
and
a
touch
of
warmth
as
it
goes
down
the
beer
is
not
fake
tastingan
issue
i
find
coming
up
with
many
pumpkin
brews
the
only
thing
that
might
hold
me
back
from
returning
to
it
would
be
the
price
point
in
a
market
where
some
of
the
competition
will
sell
sixpacks
8
99
72
oz
12
cents
per
oz
vs
22
oz
41
cents
per
oz
i
dont
know
if
it
stands
out
enough
for
the
added
cost
price
notwithstanding
this
is
a
decent
quality
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
smooth
and
a
little
crisp
with
a
nice
flow
in
a
solid
medium
body
with
ample
but
not
overdone
carbonation
horrible
a
sickly
sweet
syrupy
mess
with
one
hell
of
an
alcohol
burn
no
balance
weak
body
pale
uninspiring
color
just
not
a
good
beer
and
for
almost
10
a
bottle
i
feel
ripped
off
its
clear
that
there
are
few
pumpkin
ales
that
are
more
than
a
gimmick
serving
type
bottle
pours
an
orangeamber
with
a
small
amount
of
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
strong
of
spices
especially
cinnamon
there
is
a
light
boozey
smell
too
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
taste
is
spicey
and
again
with
much
cinnamon
there
is
some
but
not
much
of
a
pumpkin
flavor
there
this
isnt
a
great
pumpkin
style
beer
but
not
horrible
overall
a
very
enjoyable
example
of
a
pumpkin
beer
and
one
ill
certainly
purchase
again
soon
it
looked
like
autumn
in
a
glass
with
the
color
of
pumpkin
and
a
massive
creamy
tan
head
it
left
thick
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
mostly
metal
and
nutmeg
and
the
flavor
was
sweet
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
very
subtle
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
the
best
pumpkin
ales
have
muted
spice
and
this
one
is
muted
much
more
so
than
shipyards
regular
pumkin
ale
the
feel
was
a
weakness
very
thin
with
nothing
left
behind
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
low
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
the
spices
seemed
a
little
strong
at
times
but
still
pretty
tasty
overall
i
liked
it
a
lot
better
then
their
pumpkinhead
one
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
say
pumking
solid
pumpkin
offering
id
be
happy
to
but
again
for
the
season
glassware
bomber
split
into
snifters
o
i
like
this
beer
for
its
moderate
sweetness
paired
with
a
spice
finish
that
captures
the
feeling
of
the
fall
very
well
considering
that
this
is
only
the
second
pumpkin
beer
that
i
have
ever
tried
i
could
be
exaggerating
nonetheless
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
and
will
try
it
again
soon
overall
its
flavor
improves
as
the
bottle
suggests
as
it
warms
but
even
around
optimal
temperature
id
like
to
get
more
pumpkin
out
of
this
smashed
pumpkin
i
pretty
much
enjoy
anything
resembling
the
flavor
profile
of
pumpkin
pie
so
even
if
it
fell
a
bit
shy
in
the
pumpkin
department
yes
i
think
this
one
was
worth
trying
o
overall
an
above
average
pumpkin
ale
but
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
memory
of
it
lots
of
spices
and
cinnamon
and
not
at
much
pumpkin
as
i
would
have
liked
would
have
it
again
but
not
my
favorite
o
this
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
flavors
of
pumpkins
and
spices
and
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
because
it
isnt
that
sweet
and
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
ive
had
this
before
and
i
remember
it
being
an
overspiced
bigger
version
of
shipyards
pumpkinhead
which
i
dont
like
either
i
remembered
correctly
drainpour
medium
thickness
in
the
mouthfeel
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
o
good
example
of
the
style
o
exactly
as
advertised
a
great
tasting
pumpkin
beer
will
buy
again
overall
a
tasty
beer
might
try
again
at
thanksgiving
overall
this
beer
begins
well
with
a
delicious
aroma
that
reminds
me
instantly
of
grandmas
house
and
places
this
beer
on
par
with
southern
tiers
pumking
in
terms
of
enticing
pumpkinflavored
beer
scents
but
the
beer
proves
far
too
spicy
on
the
tongue
and
the
resulting
imbalance
unfortunately
takes
away
from
the
pumpkin
and
ale
flavors
its
still
a
very
nice
pumpkin
beer
mind
youmuch
better
fare
than
many
of
its
peersand
the
9
abv
is
well
hidden
by
sugars
and
flavor
but
as
a
whole
the
brew
wants
for
balance
and
a
shade
more
subtlety
o
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
yet
this
one
shows
a
strong
spice
profile
as
the
main
attraction
its
warm
and
spicy
but
missed
the
mark
some
with
the
pumpkin
fruit
and
sweet
components
in
my
opinion
o
pretty
darn
good
very
likable
if
you
are
looking
for
something
that
isnt
extremely
heavy
on
the
spices
yet
still
retains
the
pumpkin
pie
characteristics
of
many
other
pumpkin
ales
overall
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
ale
considering
shipyards
other
offering
good
brew
to
tide
one
over
till
september
color
is
light
for
a
pumpkin
almost
golden
yellow
only
slightly
orangebrown
big
bubbly
head
and
a
fully
carbonated
body
spices
pop
out
but
dont
stand
out
like
a
pie
spices
it
smells
artificial
almost
like
out
of
an
aerosol
can
light
grains
back
up
the
awkward
spice
character
light
malt
body
for
the
flavor
crisp
almost
like
a
pale
or
pilsner
malt
was
used
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
light
body
once
again
vibrant
but
synthetic
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
bubbly
finish
with
the
spices
lingering
over
some
sour
malts
interesting
to
try
but
the
light
bubbly
body
and
awkward
spice
texture
didnt
work
for
me
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
some
malty
aromas
and
a
slight
sour
scent
i
am
also
getting
some
apple
juice
smells
taste
is
extremely
strong
on
the
spices
with
some
slight
malt
and
pumpkin
flavors
the
spice
level
is
very
bitter
and
is
too
much
for
me
this
pretty
much
ruins
the
beer
in
my
opinion
the
beer
is
also
super
carbonated
so
this
is
like
drinking
a
glass
of
soda
water
with
spices
dumped
in
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bad
beer
that
is
just
way
overdone
with
the
bitter
spices
o
not
that
good
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
still
a
fall
taste
to
it
o
almost
a
perfect
beer
for
me
the
pumpkin
and
the
cinammon
are
perfectely
outstanding
the
smell
catchs
your
attention
without
question
i
would
get
it
again
o
overall
i
will
not
say
i
am
a
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
but
i
am
a
fan
of
dfhs
punkin
ale
and
the
bruerys
autumn
maple
so
i
thought
i
would
venture
outside
my
norm
i
wont
say
i
was
disappointed
with
this
beer
but
definitely
did
not
stand
out
or
wow
me
i
would
however
pick
up
some
more
and
save
it
for
thanksgiving
and
christmas
eve
and
day
overall
eh
not
that
impressed
syke
im
blown
away
clearly
twitterpated
i
was
looking
for
big
smooth
pumpkin
and
this
one
delivers
go
shipyard
go
o
this
is
a
really
good
pumpkin
ale
and
at
9
it
certainly
packs
a
punch
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
enjoy
more
as
the
weather
cools
a
very
tasty
spiced
beermore
of
a
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
beer
than
a
true
pumpkin
beer
overall
i
was
a
bit
dissapointed
maybe
this
was
a
different
style
than
i
was
normally
used
to
with
a
pumkin
beer
but
ill
try
another
and
see
if
it
grows
on
me
im
a
pumpkin
freak
so
this
beer
has
been
a
seasonal
favorite
of
mine
for
years
this
year
though
i
felt
it
really
hit
the
mark
there
was
just
enough
pumpkin
and
spices
to
remind
me
of
autumn
but
without
being
too
sweet
or
over
spiced
ill
probably
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
pumpkin
gem
o
pumpkin
beers
rock
especially
imperial
ones
like
this
a
fun
b
the
pumpkin
does
make
an
appearance
on
the
finish
and
the
mouthfeel
is
gorgeous
i
wouldve
rated
this
beer
higher
had
there
been
a
lil
less
spice
and
a
lil
more
pumpkin
on
the
whole
a
very
enjoyable
offering
from
shipyard
though
tastes
like
a
pumpkin
dessert
with
way
too
much
cinnamon
and
spices
nice
aroma
but
flavored
too
strongly
o
this
pumpkin
ale
features
everything
you
would
expect
in
the
style
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
is
a
little
on
the
sweetboozy
side
i
went
with
a
more
delicate
pour
than
usual
as
i
was
unsure
as
to
the
amount
of
lees
present
i
got
a
finger
of
tawny
head
that
fell
pretty
quickly
color
was
a
coppery
orangishamber
with
nequality
clarity
and
lots
of
co2
bubbles
bupgoo
nose
had
taken
on
a
clovetobacco
quality
in
the
interim
and
i
began
to
debate
donning
a
black
beret
for
the
occasion
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
full
on
the
tongue
and
combined
with
the
clovenutmegallspice
flavors
it
was
like
drinking
liquid
pumpkin
pie
i
must
remember
to
get
some
more
this
year
i
was
worried
that
it
had
gone
over
like
many
of
the
pumpkin
ales
in
my
cellar
but
this
was
phenomenal
finish
was
literally
breathtaking
with
regard
to
its
spiciness
i
may
carve
a
pumpkin
tonight
in
this
beers
honor
providing
i
can
find
such
a
gourd
hauntingly
ghoulicious
say
is
that
a
black
cat
at
my
back
door
here
kitty
kitty
a
far
better
beer
than
their
normal
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
has
a
good
color
of
deep
amber
with
a
solid
white
looking
head
on
it
the
smell
is
much
spicier
than
the
regular
pumpkin
brew
the
taste
has
some
complexity
to
it
with
some
sweet
vanilla
and
autumn
spices
upfront
that
fade
into
a
mild
pumpkin
flavor
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
twice
as
heavy
as
the
other
brew
leaving
a
good
coating
in
the
mouth
overall
id
say
dont
even
waste
your
time
with
shipyards
other
pumpkin
beer
just
ask
for
this
one
or
keep
your
eyes
peeled
for
it
youll
be
far
more
impressed
with
this
one
its
almost
hard
to
believe
that
theyre
from
the
same
company
mouthfuldo
coats
your
mouth
well
the
pumpkin
ale
flavor
lingers
and
dissipates
just
in
time
for
you
to
want
to
take
another
sip
leaving
this
beer
fairly
drinkable
and
tade
bit
dangerous
for
being
a
high
abv
at
9
really
though
thanksgiving
and
halloween
isnt
that
what
you
want
anyways
great
stuff
truly
the
only
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
been
impressed
by
go
out
and
buy
it
today
if
you
can
poured
a
very
clear
amberorange
with
a
bubbly
offwhite
head
has
some
bubbles
streaming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
some
light
lacing
aromas
of
the
actual
pumpkin
with
some
nutmeg
and
other
spices
i
really
liked
this
pumpkin
ale
reminded
me
of
southern
tiers
pumking
imperial
pumpkin
ale
i
would
say
top
3
or
4
favorite
pumpkin
ales
this
also
had
about
9
months
on
it
so
the
9
helped
keep
it
preserved
perfectly
lets
see
how
it
ages
more
proof
that
pumpkin
ales
need
to
be
massive
or
at
least
that
is
what
i
prefer
good
drinking
for
the
holiday
or
i
would
even
think
it
is
possible
to
cellar
a
bottle
and
perhaps
cook
with
it
as
well
full
bodied
darkdark
amber
a
bit
hazy
while
its
full
bodied
it
does
not
taste
like
its
a
9
beer
very
easy
drinking
poured
out
the
lightest
of
the
three
with
a
hazy
orange
tinted
amber
color
and
a
nice
soft
off
white
head
that
reached
a
height
of
around
an
inch
or
so
before
it
settled
down
with
some
nice
lacing
on
the
side
that
really
just
surprised
me
with
how
well
it
hung
in
there
to
be
honest
really
quite
the
solid
look
nice
aroma
of
pumpkin
spice
hints
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
all
the
usual
characters
here
with
a
touch
of
a
west
coast
hop
flair
to
it
especially
as
it
warms
crisp
and
super
clean
flavor
here
starts
with
a
touch
of
a
light
malt
note
and
then
swoops
in
with
a
big
hit
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
which
dries
out
the
palate
very
nicely
very
even
consistency
i
have
to
admit
as
it
comes
together
very
nice
light
drying
of
palate
leaves
a
touch
of
light
spice
and
the
lightest
hint
of
hops
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
taste
is
light
caramelized
pumpkin
up
front
with
raisiny
grain
maltiness
some
pumpkinpie
spice
raisiny
alcoholic
spiciness
light
spicy
bitterness
faintly
herbal
it
has
some
good
yeasty
toasted
grain
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
overall
this
is
pretty
good
and
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
although
its
9
0
does
sneak
up
on
you
i
would
track
it
down
again
when
it
comes
time
for
the
pumpkin
brews
o
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
though
i
do
welcome
it
at
this
time
of
year
near
the
end
of
my
glass
its
tougher
to
finish
than
at
the
beginning
but
im
still
enjoying
it
certainly
worth
a
try
whether
its
the
season
for
pumpkin
beers
or
simply
to
serve
as
a
reminder
of
that
great
time
of
year
mouthfeel
drinkability
while
the
spices
can
be
overwhelming
at
times
i
feel
as
if
they
are
very
well
balanced
for
the
most
part
i
get
a
sort
of
sickening
spice
taste
that
quickly
smooths
out
to
a
delicious
onslaught
of
pumpkin
and
gourds
overall
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
d
very
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
not
over
the
top
in
the
spice
department
well
balanced
very
enjoyable
brew
to
have
again
i
would
seek
this
brew
out
again
and
also
recommend
this
brew
if
you
are
into
pumpkin
brews
poured
a
medium
copperorange
with
a
large
creamy
off
white
head
that
was
fully
lasting
and
had
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
was
mild
of
caramel
malts
and
a
sweet
doughy
yeast
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
it
tasted
sweet
with
a
slight
alcohol
flavor
at
first
then
matured
to
a
sweet
and
creamy
flavor
with
strong
hints
of
nutmeg
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
with
a
slight
alcohol
aftertaste
that
stayed
wit
you
a
nice
long
while
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
and
creamy
in
texture
with
a
flat
carbonation
overall
a
nice
tasting
pumpkin
ale
a
light
yellow
copper
color
clear
with
a
modest
white
fuzz
on
top
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
kind
of
different
with
cotton
candy
sweetness
berry
overtones
with
honey
and
mild
pumpkin
the
flavor
offers
less
sweetness
and
more
of
a
solid
pumpkin
and
honey
mix
lots
of
honey
actually
its
medium
bodied
with
fair
carbonation
with
a
tingly
but
vaguely
syrupy
feel
its
got
a
spicey
nearly
dry
edge
to
it
modest
drinkability
because
of
the
feel
its
an
odd
bird
and
seems
somewhat
atypical
of
most
but
well
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
at
all
the
mouthfeel
has
a
good
mic
of
carbonation
and
seems
a
bit
medium
bodied
so
the
drinkability
is
a
good
but
can
be
bad
at
9
it
goes
down
easy
try
sipping
it
though
or
you
will
go
threw
these
quickly
since
i
feel
it
is
a
medium
bodied
and
easy
drinking
i
honestly
hope
that
i
got
a
bad
bottle
as
i
am
currently
converting
my
old
notes
into
ba
reviews
i
am
having
flashbacks
of
drinking
this
beer
i
remember
it
vividly
because
it
was
so
poor
this
is
the
worst
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
but
on
the
bright
side
it
created
a
benchmark
that
i
can
compare
to
other
beers
of
the
style
thr
beer
is
malt
and
smooth
to
start
spices
become
apparent
as
the
carbonation
presents
and
finishes
its
smooth
and
very
flavored
but
heavy
but
for
a
pumpkin
beer
one
of
the
best
taken
in
part
from
my
blog
at
realbeer
wordpress
com
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
but
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
either
seek
out
other
pumpkin
ales
because
of
the
high
point
of
this
beer
and
the
quantityquality
of
other
offerings
on
the
market
will
not
be
seeking
out
again
next
season
unless
shipyard
steps
it
up
yeah
pleasant
could
be
better
with
a
clearer
palate
a
bit
sweet
and
a
bit
sour
needs
more
bitter
maybe
md
medium
bodied
maybe
a
little
thin
carbonation
a
touch
high
drinkability
is
good
a
pretty
solid
beer
this
is
a
really
great
pumpkin
ale
it
really
conveys
to
me
all
the
characters
i
feel
should
be
there
the
pie
spice
the
burnt
sugar
sweetness
even
the
slightly
dry
pastry
character
i
feel
like
this
is
the
pumpkin
ale
which
sums
up
the
style
for
me
its
very
good
indeed
im
not
sure
ive
had
a
better
example
well
recommended
d
terrible
this
was
actually
my
1st
allout
drainpour
and
the
girlfriend
agreed
shipyard
needs
to
stop
making
pumpkin
beers
and
this
is
from
someone
who
usually
loves
the
style
avoid
this
nice
smashed
pumpkin
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
slice
of
my
favorite
carrot
cake
lloyds
carrot
cake
6097
broadway
bronx
ny
to
accompany
the
beer
overall
not
bad
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
and
frankly
not
all
that
original
or
memorable
but
solid
nonetheless
and
overall
a
pleasing
experience
ive
drank
my
fair
share
of
pumpkinhead
and
then
some
my
buddies
love
it
so
its
often
the
best
option
around
so
i
came
into
this
with
fairly
low
expectations
so
it
certainly
exceeded
this
low
bar
dont
seek
this
out
but
at
7bomber
it
fits
the
bill
for
this
monday
night
showdown
d
this
beer
may
be
falls
biggest
surprise
a
pumpkin
ale
that
presents
appealing
sensory
qualities
without
really
seeming
like
a
compromised
effort
although
the
flavors
found
here
dont
measure
up
to
the
outstanding
aroma
they
are
by
no
means
offputting
make
no
mistake
spices
do
define
the
taste
of
this
beer
but
they
do
not
cross
the
line
to
the
point
of
ruining
it
considering
shipyards
predictably
english
stylistic
tendencies
they
are
found
here
to
be
a
good
if
somewhat
understated
match
with
a
style
whose
value
is
oftentimes
questionable
perhaps
most
remarkable
is
the
deftness
with
which
the
robust
alcohol
content
is
completely
hidden
in
the
end
shipyards
smashed
pumpkin
is
versatile
and
to
be
taken
seriously
serve
with
savory
sweet
or
solo
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pumpkin
orange
color
with
a
thick
slightly
off
white
head
which
resides
to
a
little
lace
the
aroma
is
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
along
with
some
other
spices
the
taste
is
of
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
there
is
more
spice
flavors
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
than
anything
else
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
a
little
above
average
it
is
an
easy
drink
but
it
isnt
as
flavorful
as
other
pumpkin
beers
its
solid
but
not
near
the
best
in
class
d
it
drank
pretty
good
and
have
to
say
that
it
is
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
this
was
the
last
beer
to
cap
things
off
on
pumpkin
trickin
treatin
day
as
a
fall
seasonal
this
works
well
with
its
combination
of
pumpkin
with
elements
of
an
oktoberfest
marzen
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
i
think
mixing
this
with
a
stout
or
porter
would
be
much
more
pleasing
and
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
lacks
the
vegetal
deficits
many
of
the
less
saccharine
examples
often
exhibit
drinkability
this
beer
went
down
fairly
quickly
depsite
the
higher
alcohol
levels
overall
a
tasty
beer
from
shipyard
lighter
to
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
soft
carbonation
some
alcohol
is
felt
but
not
overwhelming
very
nice
balance
of
spices
and
sweetness
very
nice
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
but
probably
not
my
favorite
ill
probably
use
the
rest
of
my
bomber
to
make
an
orange
and
black
with
some
brooklyn
black
chocolate
stout
d
poor
think
im
gonna
dump
this
beer
is
silky
creamy
butterscotchy
with
a
horrible
pumpkin
sour
bitterness
at
the
back
end
its
like
eating
the
skin
off
the
pumpkin
after
its
dipped
in
fake
butter
never
again
this
is
one
exceptional
imperial
pumpkin
brilliantly
clear
light
copper
with
a
decent
white
head
and
lacing
a
bit
of
carbonation
visible
smell
is
gorgeous
big
sweet
bready
malt
and
pumpkin
pie
nutmeg
and
vanilla
flow
beautifully
through
the
aroma
a
spiciness
that
i
cant
quite
describe
a
light
floral
hops
and
a
trace
of
alcohol
taste
is
just
short
of
perfect
in
my
book
this
is
like
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
with
a
graham
cracker
crust
big
pumpkin
front
and
deep
malt
backbone
combine
to
make
a
smooth
mildly
sweet
introduction
nice
vanilla
component
finish
leaves
touches
of
graham
and
and
mellow
earthy
hops
some
hearty
bread
as
the
main
player
very
british
feel
is
gently
crisp
and
mildly
carbonated
this
drinks
like
a
session
ale
so
be
careful
my
fave
so
far
in
the
world
of
big
pumps
anyway
this
had
the
potential
to
be
a
good
beer
but
the
amount
of
spice
completely
ruined
the
flavor
and
aroma
looking
back
at
other
reviews
it
appears
it
was
better
last
year
but
this
batch
of
smashed
pumpkin
will
join
the
hall
of
fame
as
one
of
about
5
beers
that
conquered
me
and
forced
a
pourout
edit
matts
review
makes
it
clear
that
at
least
one
more
at
the
tasting
found
this
to
be
thoroughly
disgusting
d
the
dryness
makes
this
one
a
little
tough
to
get
used
to
but
it
tastes
so
damn
good
i
need
more
overall
i
like
the
beer
in
comparison
to
other
pumpkin
ales
certainly
better
than
shipyards
pumpkinhead
which
i
am
not
impressed
with
d
this
beer
honestly
didnt
do
much
for
me
the
boozy
character
overshadowed
the
pumpkin
and
left
the
beer
feeling
off
kilter
an
ok
but
no
exceptional
pumpkin
beer
taste
is
laid
back
as
well
right
away
you
get
a
warm
and
sweet
pumpkin
flavor
the
spices
dull
away
the
sweetness
and
hide
the
9
fairly
well
nice
rounded
flavor
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
most
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
has
a
nice
balance
i
can
honestly
say
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
look
for
it
again
drinkability
tastes
great
the
drinkability
is
perfect
for
what
it
is
would
not
want
more
than
a
22
oz
bomber
in
one
session
good
after
dinner
beer
skip
the
dessert
on
sunday
nite
and
kick
back
with
a
smashed
pumpkin
pours
a
beautiful
ambercopperish
color
the
smell
smells
of
sweetness
it
tastes
on
the
sweeter
side
less
spicy
than
many
pumpkin
ales
and
also
not
as
thin
but
sweeter
and
with
a
decidedly
more
pumpkin
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
syrupy
for
a
9
beer
that
is
somewhat
thin
there
is
not
the
alcohol
taste
i
would
expect
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
under
the
sweetness
and
syrupiness
as
a
style
pumpkin
beers
often
disappoint
me
but
this
one
is
a
solid
one
drinkability
a
very
different
perhaps
by
mistake
but
tasty
pumpkin
beer
there
is
a
most
definite
infected
quality
to
this
pumpkin
beer
but
by
god
it
works
the
quirky
barnyard
funk
makes
the
spices
and
pumpkin
flavor
absolutely
enticing
this
is
the
most
interesting
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
pumpkin
beer
i
have
come
across
i
feel
this
is
an
anomaly
but
hell
if
it
will
stop
me
from
picking
up
another
very
enjoyable
a
mediocre
pumpkin
ale
in
my
opinion
the
most
impressive
thing
about
it
is
how
well
this
thin
brew
covered
the
9
abv
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
again
certainly
glad
i
didnt
pay
the
premium
price
for
a
bottle
drinks
like
pumpkin
ale
light
smashed
pumpkin
has
a
lot
of
flavor
smashed
in
there
but
a
light
body
and
crisp
lagerlike
finish
make
it
easydrinking
loved
the
aroma
liked
the
flavor
a
nice
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
a
creamy
amount
of
carbonation
this
has
made
me
open
to
taste
a
few
more
pumpkin
brews
and
its
certainly
not
the
worst
beer
ive
had
but
im
not
purchasing
it
of
my
own
free
will
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
but
nothing
great
here
its
kind
of
just
above
average
drinkability
a
pretty
good
beer
and
definitely
a
sipper
however
this
one
lacks
enough
balance
to
make
it
great
this
beer
is
a
bit
hot
and
i
enjoy
the
extra
alcohol
to
warm
me
up
being
that
is
is
fairly
carbonated
it
goes
down
quite
smooth
this
has
to
be
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
yet
although
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
because
i
realize
this
style
just
isnt
for
me
shipyard
is
a
very
good
brewery
and
pugsley
if
you
read
this
knock
it
off
with
the
pumpkinhead
which
is
so
subtle
that
while
not
horrible
it
is
simply
a
noncontender
this
is
a
world
class
pumpkin
ale
that
is
the
stalking
horse
for
the
style
d
this
beer
was
fantastic
much
more
so
than
when
it
is
fresh
the
higher
abv
limits
this
beer
but
still
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
22ozs
by
myself
after
that
though
i
would
move
onto
something
else
a
crystal
clear
orange
brew
with
fine
carbonation
lovely
tiny
bubbles
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
are
incredibly
well
balanced
all
of
the
elements
dance
so
well
together
sweet
pumpkin
and
malts
spices
and
hops
nothing
is
overdone
very
very
smooth
and
drinkable

ounce
bottle
from
2010
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
went
away
quickly
not
much
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
mostly
spicy
the
brew
smells
like
nutmeg
cloves
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
a
little
bit
of
booze
noticable
in
the
flavor
i
think
the
aroma
is
better
than
the
taste
as
the
pumpkin
spice
flavors
arent
quite
as
strong
compared
to
the
strength
of
the
spices
in
the
aroma
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
enough
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
but
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
either
id
try
this
again
in
the
future
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
brew
to
me
this
is
second
to
st
pumpking
and
neck
and
neck
with
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
worth
trying
at
least
once
but
hunt
pumpking
first
its
a
good
looking
beer
with
a
transparent
orangeamber
color
and
a
creamy
offwhite
head
lots
of
sweet
pumpkin
pie
spice
in
the
aroma
the
pumpkin
flavor
shows
up
in
a
supporting
role
its
a
bit
too
sugary
but
it
kind
of
works
with
the
spice
the
beer
tastes
fairly
sweet
but
theres
lots
of
spice
here
as
well
it
reminds
me
of
an
english
barleywine
mixed
with
pumpkin
pie
the
booze
is
relatively
light
and
just
provides
warmth
its
a
big
smooth
beer
gets
better
as
it
warms
very
full
mouthfeel
particularly
for
the
style
im
not
always
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
or
shipyard
but
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
good
to
drink
slowly
d
fairly
high
a
good
imperial
pumpkin
beer
ill
buy
a
few
more
of
these
before
the
season
is
out
thanks
for
sharing
jason
light
orangeno

smooth
boozy
understated
pumpkin
rich
nutmeg
mostly
smells
like
the
pumpkin
spice
a
sipper
understated
carbonation
much
of
a
sweet
spice
delivery
not
as
drinkable
as
i
would
like
a
different
take
drinkability
a
really
nice
pumpkin
ale
overall
with
great
sweet
and
robust
flavors
may
sit
a
bit
heavy
though
and
the
9
abv
would
catch
up
to
you
after
a
while
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
dense
eggshell
colored
head
that
looks
like
you
can
rest
a
quarter
on
the
head
settles
into
a
nice
puffy
cap
the
aroma
is
a
bit
grainy
some
light
metallic
notes
and
light
pumpkin
spice
the
taste
is
of
pale
malt
with
some
pumpkin
spice
cinnamon
ginger
nutmeg
there
is
a
bit
of
a
fruitiness
to
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
very
present
and
overwhelms
this
beer
the
malt
body
is
too
light
for
this
type
of
booze
level
the
spice
flavor
is
light
but
appropriate
the
body
is
light
with
very
fizzy
carbonation
drinks
crisp
there
is
significant
belly
burn
from
the
abv
the
flavor
is
not
too
bad
its
not
overpowering
which
is
good
but
the
abv
is
just
not
needed
take
about
34
off
and
you
have
a
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
even
though
im
not
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
brews
this
one
definitely
stands
out
amongst
the
others
ive
tried
just
a
wellmade
beer
pours
a
halloween
dark
orange
with
spirits
floating
above
the
body
the
aroma
is
like
the
smell
of
the
people
under
the
stairs
in
the
last
house
on
the
left
actually
a
solid
tasting
full
bodied
pumpkin
ale
here
i
didnt
expect
much
having
had
the
sugary
artificial
shipyard
pumpkin
the
smashed
pumpkin
is
a
solid
pumpkin
offering
i
would
pick
up
again
very
nice
feel
to
it
and
went
down
very
smoothly
glided
down
my
taste
buds
like
a
witch
on
her
broom
drinkability
its
pretty
good
not
great
mind
you
and
unlike
its
the
great
pumpkin
d
i
guess
if
your
a
fan
of
pumpkin
head
youll
like
this
then
again
probably
not
unlike
pumpkinhead
which
tends
to
be
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
the
opposite
sorry
to
say
this
stuff
is
a
drain
pour
for
me
from
the
22
fl
oz
2010
batch
bottle
sampled
on
sept
13
2010
the
pour
is
orange
with
a
bit
of
copper
mixed
in
and
a
thin
white
head
and
limited
lacing
beautifully
clear
the
pumpkin
and
spiced
aromas
are
solid
with
almost
nothing
in
the
way
of
alcohol
considering
it
is
a
9
abv
beer
the
taste
is
also
a
generous
dose
of
pumpkin
spices
clove
and
a
mildly
hopped
bitterness
a
nice
one
to
have
during
the
season
d
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
by
volume
this
brew
is
surprisingly
drinkable
i
could
definitely
have
another
after
this
one
d
well
yes
it
is
quite
good
and
if
its
still
around
in
october
i
may
fancy
another
bomber
to
see
if
the
bitterness
will
round
out
a
bit
leaving
sweet
malt
it
was
good
fresh
though
so
no
complaints
overall
its
a
tasty
beer
but
one
is
enough
i
now
know
what
im
bringing
to
thanksgiving
dinner
drinkability
is
good
much
better
brew
then
their
regular
pumpkin
ale
and
up
there
with
the
best
d
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
someone
who
is
just
starting
with
pumpkin
brews
you
can
taste
the
pumpkin
but
still
want
to
throw
back
quite
a
few
of
these
they
go
down
easy
d
gotta
give
it
big
drinkability
points
you
could
give
this
to
any
beer
novice
and
they
would
get
quickly
hammered
however
there
are
still
enough
layers
of
flavors
here
to
be
interesting
and
it
ultimately
tastes
like
beer
d
great
i
had
this
before
maybe
november
and
i
was
disappointed
perhaps
i
was
in
a
sour
mood
then
but
i
think
that
this
aged
really
well
i
would
have
again
d
definitely
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
way
too
much
cinnamon
for
me
this
is
my
real
problem
with
pumpkin
ales
most
brewers
go
over
the
top
with
spices
at
least
this
isnt
a
syrupy
mess
like
some
ill
pass
if
i
see
this
again
so
far
pumking
reigns
supreme
in
the
pumpkin
ale
category
for
me
danother
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
i
could
easily
have
two
of
these
notes
this
is
a
very
well
done
pumpkin
beer
with
wonderful
complexity
decent
balance
and
texture
this
is
much
better
then
there
other
pumpkin
beer
by
far
in
fact
this
one
is
going
high
up
on
my
favorite
list
drinkability
i
could
have
easily
had
more
of
this
beer
and
will
likely
make
an
attempt
to
find
it
in
stores
during
the
fall
it
was
well
worth
it
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
it
is
very
festive
for
the
fall
season
light
on
the
finish
there
is
a
hint
of
cinnamon
and
pepper
in
the
final
analysis
i
can
see
where
some
would
be
turned
off
by
this
but
it
definitely
works
for
me
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
sitting
though
edit
one
or
two
glasses
not
bombers
that
said
nice
take
on
the
style
have
this
one
with
some
turkey
and
dressing
when
you
are
celebrating
thanksgiving
with
family
and
friends
cheers
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
medium
bodied
the
carb
is
light
but
appropriate
finish
has
just
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
lingering
spicebitternessstickiness
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
its
not
going
to
change
anyones
life
and
beers
like
southern
tier
pumking
are
way
better
imo
this
is
nice
and
enjoyable
just
a
touch
too
strong
i
would
try
again
if
it
was
available
fresh
closer
to
halloween
and
thanksgiving
but
i
like
these
spicedherbed
beers
as
fresh
as
possible
and
this
cant
be
savored
in
that
condition
at
the
right
time
of
the
year
d
tbd
i
am
going
to
try
this
one
at
least
one
more
time
maybe
i
got
a
bad
one
i
hope
i
got
a
bad
one
for
their
sake
i
like
shipyard
beers
too
drinkability
very
drinkable
nice
and
easy
and
goes
down
very
smooth
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
a
bit
of
warmth
but
pretty
smooth
pretty
interesting
take
but
not
my
style
thanks
russ
d
unique
take

enjoying
this
one
this
afternoon
shipyard
has
a
very
distinctive
yeast
flavoring
to
all
of
their
beers
this
one
is
no
exception
very
nice
light
copper
color
with
good
clarity
not
much
to
the
head
and
it
disappears
without
a
trace
pretty
quickly
smell
is
mostly
of
spices
yeast
and
alcohol
not
a
bad
nose
but
the
pumpkin
seasoning
seems
to
be
drowned
out
by
the
other
spices
and
only
plays
a
minor
assistant
role
the
flavor
is
just
as
disappointing
and
the
alcohol
becomes
a
stronger
factor
here
dont
get
me
wrong
it
isnt
a
bad
taste
but
its
just
lacking
that
pumpkin
feel
to
it
this
medium
to
heavy
bodied
beer
leaves
its
mark
in
your
mouth
on
the
way
to
your
throat
but
is
not
an
awful
thing
to
behold
i
am
disappointed
with
this
beer
shipyard
has
made
some
very
decent
beers
adn
the
pugsleys
barley
wine
was
truly
enjoyable
sadly
i
have
to
gice
this
beer
a
lower
grade
than
i
want
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
dark
golden
amber
with
a
thin
1
finger
head
head
was
foamy
but
settled
down
to
a
thin
layer
and
didnt
cling
at
all
aroma
was
slightly
spicy
trace
amount
of
nutmeg
no
real
strong
pumpkin
aroma
pie
or
otherwise
pumpkin
was
more
present
in
the
flavor
like
a
thin
pumpkin
pie
lightly
spiced
slightly
creamy
small
amounts
of
sweetness
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
well
nicely
carbonated
reasonable
to
drink
didnt
do
a
good
job
of
hiding
the
abv
however
d
this
is
really
a
mixed
bag
there
are
good
parts
and
bad
parts
this
would
make
a
good
cool
weather
warmer
makes
you
feel
good
inside
but
id
have
someone
to
split
the
bottle
with
shipyard
smashed
pumpkin
didnt
quite
win
me
over
but
im
still
not
sorry
about
spending
8
99
on
the
bomber
my
advice
to
any
new
englanders
looking
for
good
gourd
beer
is
to
spend
that
money
on
a
sixer
of
the
excellent
smuttynose
pumpkin
ale
instead
mouthfeeldrinkability
unfortunately
at
this
point
nothing
can
save
this
beer
from
the
gallows
but
at
least
the
texture
isnt
terrible
it
rises
to
a
prickly
aggressive
carbonation
level
and
then
subsides
to
a
reasonably
smooth
finish
im
not
sure
if
this
years
offering
was
majorly
lacking
in
balance
and
overall
structure
but
i
really
hope
for
the
brewerys
sake
that
this
recipe
gets
some
serious
attention
and
retooling
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
interesting
carbonation
but
still
very
easy
to
drink
might
be
a
little
sweet
for
some
people
but
i
enjoyed
it
drinkability
i
think
is
my
first
shipyard
beer
ive
reviewed
and
though
i
want
to
try
more
especially
in
this
series
this
isnt
one
i
was
thrilled
about
the
8
price
tag
adding
my
dismay
a
bit
i
wonder
how
this
would
work
to
cook
with
because
i
could
see
it
doing
good
things
dont
get
me
wrong
im
finishing
the
bomber
but
yes
way
too
big
for
everyone
to
balance
too
much
alcohol
and
not
enough
balance
poured
a
light
brown
caramel
into
a
tulip
glass
nutmeg
was
prevelent
with
other
spices
in
the
background
pumpkin
comes
through
in
the
middle
with
a
smooth
texture
and
a
clean
finish
a
medium
bodied
pumpkin
ale
not
my
favorite
but
well
worth
mention
f
pretty
spicey
and
hot
a
slight
burn
and
sting
from
alcohol
and
spices
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
is
nice
and
it
helps
through
the
chili
windy
autumn
a
little
lingering
syrupy
sweetness
seems
to
stick
around
for
a
bit
the
spice
taste
fades
very
quickly
then
it
dries
right
off
quite
a
bit
its
almost
pulling
the
water
out
of
my
tongue
pores
d
the
alcohol
hinders
things
a
bit
drinkabilitywise
a
slow
sipper
best
served
in
a
chalice
while
splitting
a
bomber
with
a
friend
not
terribly
exciting
the
serving
size
is
just
about
right
for
this
ale
as
the
alcohol
heat
threatens
to
take
over
spices
are
not
overdone
though
and
it
makes
for
a
smooth
drinking
experience
the
bottle
suggests
adding
some
stout
to
make
a
winter
warmer
and
that
seems
like
a
good
idea
to
add
some
body
to
this
tasty
brew
22oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
slightly
orange
color
there
is
a
small
white
head
on
it
that
drops
away
very
quickly
the
aroma
is
pumpkin
pie
spice
but
not
overpoweringly
so
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
in
the
background
taste
is
a
mostly
of
the
pie
spices
with
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
in
the
background
overall
taste
is
just
a
bit
sweet
pretty
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
not
evident
at
all
a
very
good
seasonal
d
easy
to
drink
could
definitely
see
myself
going
through
a
couple
of
these
tonight
problem
is
the
high
price
tag
i
could
probably
drink
more
of
this
than
pumpkinhead
unfortunately
not
at
the
price
theyre
selling
it
for
o
its
not
bad
it
just
not
balanced
its
all
natural
flavors
and
little
beer
drinkability
pretty
good
overall
pretty
disappointing
for
11
i
expected
much
more
too
sweet
and
spicy
and
not
enough
squash
taste
and
what
pumpkin
flavor
is
there
tastes
artificial
worth
a
try
but
not
worth
going
through
any
trouble
for
for
a
great
imperial
pumpkin
ale
southern
tier
pumking
remains
the
king
none
of
the
other
three
i
have
tried
have
even
come
close
the
weyerbacher
was
also
very
good
but
nothing
seems
to
attempt
what
southern
tier
is
doing
by
infusing
a
truly
unique
pie
crust
taste
with
plenty
of
real
squash
flavor
i
was
going
to
save
this
for
the
phish
concert
in
syracuse
in
a
few
weeks
but
thankfully
i
decided
to
crack
it
ill
be
tailgating
with
pumking
instead
the
is
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
and
i
have
to
say
this
one
ranks
among
my
favorites
so
far
and
the
best
beer
shipyard
brews
in
my
opinion
i
think
it
deserves
a
higher
rating
than
what
is
here
and
im
not
a
huge
pumpkin
ale
fan
theres
another
pumpkin
ale
out
there
thats
really
bready
that
everyone
loves
so
much
i
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
it
with
this
one
this
is
one
i
could
enjoy
time
and
time
again
the
beer
is
so
drinkable
that
you
really
have
to
watch
the
intake
pour
in
a
snifter
and
pace
yourself
because
this
is
one
that
will
really
sneak
up
on
you
after
a
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
thadecently
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
light
pumpkin
scent
along
with
nutmeg
and
some
munich
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
really
nice
pumpkin
character
to
it
and
is
well
spiced
its
a
bit
syrupy
which
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
like
the
fact
that
shipyard
is
making
some
big
beer
finally
this
ones
not
bad
d
ive
had
many
many
pumpkin
ales
and
consider
myself
to
quite
knowledgeable
in
this
style
while
this
particular
offering
is
beautifully
packaged
and
although
it
sits
head
and
tails
above
the
regular
terrible
shipyard
pumpkinhead
ale
it
is
still
only
mediocre
at
best
failing
to
capture
the
essence
of
the
mildlyflavored
pumpkin
as
the
main
ingredient
and
focal
point
and
instead
bombing
the
palate
with
a
heavy
handed
use
of
the
usual
bevvy
of
spices
and
a
whole
bunch
of
alcohol
no
disrespect
to
adam
pugsley
and
his
craft
but
in
the
chessgame
of
imperial
pumpkin
ales
this
one
is
merely
a
subjugate
pawn
to
weyerbachers
imperial
pumpkin
king
mouth
wow
big
full
flavor
warm
robust
bitter
finish
that
rounds
out
the
whole
thing
spices
squash
the
mouthfeel
is
sparkling
and
light
a
surprising
body
for
a
9
beer
excellent
pumpkin
beer
bomber
poured
into
a
22oz
glass
sharp
clarity
copper
orange
sunset
foam
is
creamy
and
inviting
but
doesnt
last
forever
the
standard
pumpkin
beer
aroma
of
real
pumpkin
spice
is
fairly
dominant
in
this
the
bottle
says
nutmeg
but
it
tastes
like
cinnamon
without
the
burn
a
bit
dry
from
the
moderate
spice
some
bready
qualities
come
out
from
the
pale
malt
and
wheat
pumpkin
flavor
is
there
in
spades
its
pretty
drinkable
but
i
seem
to
have
slowed
down
with
it
maybe
thats
the
9
still
it
has
a
nice
dry
bitterness
that
contrasts
well
with
some
of
the
sweeter
examples
out
there
very
smashing
solid
stuff
pumking
is
still
the
king
but
this
is
a
nice
effort
happy
halloween
overall
a
very
impressive
pumpkin
ale
heavy
on
the
spice
with
the
pumpkin
as
an
afterthought
this
is
still
one
of
the
best
new
beers
i
have
seen
this
fall
season
well
worth
seeking
out
d
really
good
overall
think
i
would
have
liked
some
more
bitterness
though
mouthfeel
is
thick
a
little
on
the
creamy
side
hides
the
booze
well
in
all
ignore
the
look
and
smell
and
just
start
drinking
much
improved
on
pumpkinhead
notes
to
be
fair
it
is
really
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beerbut
it
lacks
the
intensity
of
fullpumpkin
flavor
i
still
think
it
was
a
great
try
at
coming
close
to
the
king
i
bought
this
bottle
at
blacklick
liquor
in
blacklick
oh
near
columbus
pours
a
two
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
no
lace
crystal
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
light
pumpkin
nose
flavor
is
almost
pumpkin
pie
the
hops
are
balancing
the
sweetness

i
am
shocked
this

does
not

as
this

my
favorite
pumpkin

of
the

it
looks
like
trying
this
ontap
may
be
the
way
to
go

fairly

finish
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
well
balanced
and
flavorful
on
a
related
note
i
would
guess
that
this
beer
might
do
well
paired
with
tabak
maz
or
another
indian
dish
with
lots
of
cardamom
samhein
is
easily
my
favorite
holiday
d
just
to
rich
in
pumpkin
flavor
and
spices
to
go
down
easily
this
was
rather
disappointing
of
a
brew
but
then
again
a
pumpkin
ale
doesnt
have
much
buisness
being
imperialized
and
this
is
a
good
example
as
to
why
i
can
see
how
some
people
wouldnt
like
this
theyd
think
it
wasnt
beery
enough
or
maybe
they
just
dont
like
pumpkin
and
spice
but
if
youre
into
pumpkin
desertsnot
the
cheap
sarah
lee
pies
either
but
the
real
burny
complex
stuffthen
youre
probably
going
to
like
this
beer
on
a
better
note
im
feeling
the
9
0
now
and
my
antonio
is
starting
in
25
mins
compared
to
standouts
pumpking
and
punkin
not
as
complex
and
wellrounded
but
a
good
effort
nonetheless
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
id
only
be
able
to
have
once
a
year
but
ill
absolutely
be
looking
for
this
on
the
shelves
every
year
oh
and
its
kind
of
a
dull
orange
color
with
a
surprisingly
big
head
and
it
smells
like
pumpkin
22oz
bomber
purchased
at
whole
foods
in
portland
maine
pours
a
golden
amberred
body
with
a
good
half
inch
of
shortlived
offwhite
head
smells
spice
cinnamon
and
allspice
come
to
mind
with
a
fair
bit
of
nut
pumpkin
and
a
slight
booziness
tastes
very
spicy
with
a
woody
cinnamon
and
a
fair
bit
of
clove
a
fairly
bold
suggestion
of
pumpkin
in
this
also
with
a
slight
vegetal
quality
just
slightly
boozy
with
sharp
spice
notes
definitely
a
sipper
though
it
is
lighter
in
body
than
anticipated
with
ample
carbonation
overall
a
very
solid
beer
on
par
with
any
other
imperial
pumpkin
and
many
regular
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
good
stuff
taste
immediate
rush
of
potent
spices
into
a
decadent
caramel
sweetness
finishing
out
with
a
lightly
sourbitter
finish
has
a
continual
hoppy
bitterness
that
plays
with
the
spritzy
carbonation
theres
a
pleasurably
thick
mouthfeel
which
adds
more
contrast
flavorwise
theres
some
seasonal
spices
but
the
pumpkin
was
only
a
trace
in
the
background
caramel
sweetness
dominates
the
first
thing
i
noticed
and
then
celebrated
was
that
the
usual
shipyard
bast
of
ringwood
yeast
taste
was
no
where
to
be
found
thank
you
lord
thank
you
jesus
i
remember
it
tasting
goodcomplex
enough
yet
refreshing
and
really
working
to
discern
any
pumpkin
flavor
they
better
have
some
left
the
carbonation
is
great
for
the
style
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
given
the
9
abv
the
only
thing
that
hinders
the
drinkability
is
the
extreme
cinnamon
finish
this
is
a
beer
that
i
am
happy
i
tried
once
but
i
wont
rush
back
to
it
even
mouthfeel
semislick
finishes
bubbly
and
warm
tasty
beer
very
drinkable
this
basically
tastes
like
the
regular
pumpkinhead
ale
but
with
9
abv
there
seems
to
be
more
spiciness
and
sweetness
to
it
that
really
is
intolerable
there
is
little
carbonation
so
the
mouthfeel
is
more
smooth
and
syrupy
it
was
nasty
im
pissed
i
spent
9
and
i
still
got
a
cheap
beer
if
i
wanted
to
drink
something
like
this
i
would
sprinkle
nutmeg
cinnamon
in
a
bottle
of
pancake
syrup
and
drink
that
except
i
wouldnt
get
the
buzz
d
pumpkin
beers
usually
arent
for
me
shipyard
pumpkin
head
for
example
but
this
one
was
milder
on
the
pie
taste
and
stronger
with
the
alcohol
worth
a
try
but
wont
spend
my
9
for
another
one
tastes
like
something
you
would
use
to
remove
paint
i
love
pumpkin
ales
good
ones
dogfish
weyerbacher
souther
tier
and
this
is
definitely
not
a
good
example
of
one
in
my
opinion
did
have
a
nice
color
though
looks
can
be
deceiving
i
suppose
as
pumpkin
ales
go
this
may
be
the
best
ive
had
pours
a
very
dark
auburn
with
a
creamy
1
cm
offwhite
head
that
lasts
okay
lacing
rich
spicy
pumpkin
pie
aroma
lots
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
caramel
malt
smooth
slick
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
lively
delicious
pumpkin
and
spice
taste
like
a
blend
of
pumpkin
pie
and
zucchini
bread
strong
malts
without
the
syrpuy
mouthfeel
slightly
hoppy
to
give
it
some
bite
and
earthiness
loved
it
d
pretty
decent
pumpkin
beer
less
pumpkiny
than
most
which
i
prefer
i
find
that
a
lot
of
these
beers
are
trying
to
push
the
limits
too
much
at
times
really
delicious
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
stronger
pumpkin
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
little
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
better
than
i
was
expecting
considering
the
pumpkinhead
ale
is
my
least
favorite
pumpkin
brew
instead
of
overwhelming
spice
the
pumpkin
does
take
center
stage
the
amped
up
abv
seems
rather
unnecessary
though
either
way
a
unique
and
enjoyable
brew
for
hte
most
part
not
for
everyone
but
some
may
actually
find
it
a
sipping
beer
for
after
dinner
this
beer
pours
a
clear
burnt
orange
color
a
thin
off
white
film
coats
the
top
of
the
glass
but
disappears
rapidly
no
lacing
to
speak
of
on
this
beer
nose
is
of
pumpkin
not
your
typical
spiced
pumpkin
or
pumpkin
pie
that
is
prevelant
in
most
pumpkin
beers
this
is
straight
up
pumpkin
some
malt
and
rather
boozy
taste
is
sharply
sweet
up
front
cant
quite
place
the
sweetness
middle
is
filled
out
with
pumpkin
and
the
finish
is
sharp
booziness
actually
the
alcohol
is
the
most
dominant
flavor
in
the
entire
beer
from
start
to
finish
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
clean
on
the
tongue
but
a
sharp
boozy
taste
to
it
this
was
nice
to
try
and
with
a
lower
alochol
content
may
have
been
far
more
enjoyable
very
nicely
done
and
kind
of
like
the
big
brother
to
pumpkinhead
it
just
feels
deceptively
drinkable
and
delicious
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
halfhearted
pumpkin
ales
but
this
stands
out
in
a
good
way
pick
it
up
overall
for
my
first
pumpkin
ale
im
pretty
impressed
i
have
nothing
to
base
it
on
and
nothing
to
compare
it
to
but
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
poured
light
golden
leaving
a
3
finger
head
slowly
evaporating
to
light
lacing
nose
naked
of
pumpkinspices
taste
boring
and
without
flavour
and
a
weird
describable
aftertaste
probably
near
the
bottom
of
this
years
pumpkinspice
brews
did
i
say
it
also
tasted
flat
i
had
an
imperial
pumpkin
last
fall
at
cambridge
brewing
company
and
really
enjoyed
it
this
beer
doesnt
come
close
in
a
snifter
the
beer
was
a
copper
color
with
a
tiny
offwhite
head
mostly
spice
aroma
maybe
a
little
pumpkin
the
taste
was
all
nutmeg
some
cinnamon
and
no
pumpkin
it
was
a
bit
on
the
hot
side
the
alcohol
got
in
the
way
of
this
beer
and
it
was
far
too
spicy
with
not
enough
pumpkin
comes
in
a
bomber
with
a
fancy
gold
wrapper
around
the
neck
and
pours
a
dark
reddish
orange
with
a
head
that
quickly
fades
the
smell
is
spicy
and
sweet
rhe
taste
is
way
spicey
i
think
i
taste
peppermint
or
cinamon
unfortunaley
not
so
much
the
pumpkin
spice
i
was
hoping
for
the
sweet
spice
is
so
overpowering
on
this
one
that
i
think
it
could
be
an
xmas
beer
rather
than
a
fall
pumpkin
i
got
to
have
one
of
the
first
pours
of
this
once
the
great
lost
bear
tapped
their
first
keg
of
this
new
beer
it
was
served
in
a
tulip
glass
it
has
a
orangeruby
hue
and
almost
no
head
just
a
skim
of
bubbles
as
you
would
expect
there
is
a
pumpkin
aroma
to
the
beer
it
is
like
a
less
intense
higher
quality
version
of
pumpkinhead
it
tastes
quite
good
it
begins
with
some
cinnamon
up
front
then
turns
to
a
real
pumpkin
taste
unlike
the
pumpkin
that
so
many
hate
this
has
real
pumpkin
flavor
detractors
rejoice
it
tastes
like
autumn
as
you
drink
it
you
can
hardly
notice
that
this
is
a
9
abv
beer
its
only
in
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
you
pick
up
the
alcohol
it
has
a
bit
of
a
lighter
body
that
i
thought
but
id
still
classify
it
as
mediumbodied
as
for
drinkability
id
love
to
drink
a
number
of
these
but
i
think
the
strength
of
this
brew
would
do
me
in
but
in
terms
of
enjoying
the
flavor
you
could
taste
this
beer
over
and
over
i
cant
wait
to
crack
a
bottle
of
this
open
on
a
crisp
fall
day
once
again
alan
pugsley
has
outdone
himself
with
his
signature
series
ive
had
the
imperial
pumpking
and
this
holds
up
as
an
equal
to
that
fine
beer
this
is
one
beer
worth
seeking
out
get
it
this
season
if
you
can
hopefully
the
smashed
pumpkin
will
become
as
much
of
a
fall
tradition
here
in
southern
maine
as
its
lessrespected
cousin
pumpkinhead
i
wish
that
this
was
the
shipyard
seasonal
on
tap
around
portland
this
fall
the
beer
is
big
and
exciting
and
rather
than
an
unsessionable
high
alcohol
content
it
totally
surpasses
the
beer
it
was
inspired
by
give
this
one
a
chance
i
think
this
one
is
quite
good
not
a
good
pumpkin
ale
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
i
like
the
pumpkin
flavor
but
the
hops
surprises
me
it
may
be
too
much
for
my
palate
hop
heads
will
probably
love
this
one
though
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
a
fairly
average
pumpkin
ale
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
vegetable
taste
and
feel
moderately
spiced
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
clove
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
small
head
there
is
a
light
spice
aroma
the
taste
has
a
nice
full
pumpkin
flavor
good
spice
notes
very
balanced
good
feel
nice
body
overall
its
a
very
solid
pumpkin
just
right
amount
of
pumkin
flavor
bitter
than
most
pumkin
ales
when
i
saw
this
pumpkin
ale
available
at
my
grocery
store
i
thought
to
myself
how
delicious
also
theres
supposed
to
be
some
cinnamon
included
in
the
beverage
as
well
sadly
i
tasted
neither
all
i
tasted
was
a
bitter
ale
with
no
flavors
of
squash
or
spices
so
given
this
i
am
disappointed
i
purchased
a
6
pack
and
am
stuck
with
5
more
bottles
thats
the
bad
news
the
good
news
is
it
did
leave
me
a
good
aftertaste
sometimes
ill
have
a
flavorful
drink
and
then
12
hour
later
the
aftertaste
spoils
it
i
like
pumpkin
but
this
one
is
a
little
spicy
for
me
nice
pumpkin
flavor
more
bitter
and
hoppy
than
most
pumpkins
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
pumpkin
beers
despite
the
fact
that
i
havent
thought
to
buy
it
in
a
few
years
o
my
first
time
trying
this
east
coast
pumpkin
ale
and
i
loved
it
the
requisite
amount
of
nostalgiainducing
spices
but
incredibly
drinkable
in
part
due
to
its
uncharacteristic
hop
presence
call
me
crazy
but
this
beer
reminds
me
of
walking
through
a
pumpkin
patch
on
the
east
coast
filled
with
pumpkins
overgrown
with
vines
just
like
the
label
depicts
nailed
it
really
nice
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
for
fans
of
pumpkin
beer
this
beer
is
a
pale
ale
first
and
foremost
with
a
touch
of
pumpkin
well
chosen
floral
earthy
and
rustic
hops
provide
a
nice
bitterness
to
the
pumpkin
spice
sweetness
well
blended
flavors
and
clean
drinking
brew
not
bad
but
then
not
that
great
either
its
ok
but
not
more
o
glad
i
bought
a
pack
of
these
theyll
be
nice
on
the
cold
days
this
is
an
excellent
pumpkin
ale
found
this
at
a
local
place
and
gave
it
a
shot
was
pleasantly
surprised
while
it
is
no
where
near
as
good
as
dog
fish
head
or
whole
hog
it
is
still
a
darn
good
brew
serving
type
bottle
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
the
most
balanced
pumpkinfallharvest
ale
ive
ever
had
somehow
manages
to
have
hops
in
the
center
of
the
finish
is
extremely
crisp
and
has
a
strong
cinnamon
nose
with
all
of
the
fall
spice
flavor
youd
expect
if
you
gave
this
to
me
blind
i
would
never
in
a
million
years
guess
it
was
a
pumpkin
ale
overall
as
pumpkin
beer
goes
this
is
a
good
one
i
had
it
with
butternut
squash
ravioli
kale
salad
and
roasted
veggies
and
id
say
it
pairs
well
with
that
kind
of
autumnal
meal
if
i
had
a
goto
pumpkin
beer
it
would
be
this
one
071812
as
cask
caught
it
as
it
was
being
tapped
serious
pumpkin
pie
spice
blend
in
the
aroma
which
subsides
on
the
tongue
a
surprising
but
not
unpleasant
vegetal
finish
all
said
one
was
enough
overall
i
think
smuttynose
made
a
wise
choice
in
shying
away
from
trying
to
make
this
taste
like
pimpkin
pie
and
instead
focusing
on
the
pumpkin
and
the
typical
spices
that
it
often
includes
the
slight
sweetness
here
is
completely
natural
and
balance
perfectly
from
way
in
the
back
of
the
quaff
a
flavorful
refreshing
and
crisp
pumpkin
beer
great
beer
and
price
is
very
reasonable
this
beer
is
more
on
the
fresh
pumpkin
end
with
cinnamon
not
too
much
sweet
dessertiness
update
93014
its
just
as
good
as
i
remembered
overall
well
its
drinkable
and
i
finished
it
but
the
spices
in
this
are
just
so
strong
i
couldnt
get
to
any
other
tastes
in
it
super
hot
spices
and
no
sign
of
actual
pumpkin
just
the
associated
fall
spices
to
pour
it
down
the
drain
pours
a
pretty
cooper
color
not
very
carbonated
was
disappointed
in
this
pumpkin
ale
more
notes
of
cinnamon
than
pumpkin
finish
is
def
more
bitter
than
i
was
expecting
having
had
pumking
before
this
brew
the
bar
was
set
pretty
high
will
enjoy
the
remainder
of
the
6
pack
but
wont
be
buying
this
again
some
pumpkin
comes
through
in
the
aroma
along
with
spice
and
a
bit
of
a
caramel
malt
character
as
well
as
a
bit
of
a
vegetable
note
the
flavor
is
also
a
bit
more
mild
in
the
pumpkin
spice
with
a
little
more
bitterness
than
other
pumpkin
beers
though
more
like
an
under
ripe
fruit
or
herbal
tea
bitterness
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
freshly
raked
leaves
not
as
pumpkin
heavy
as
other
pumpkin
beers
but
its
still
there
and
the
beer
itself
seems
better
crafted
than
most
an
excellent
beer
this
drinks
like
a
beer
brewed
for
fall
season
not
like
a
pumpkin
beer
brewed
to
compete
for
the
most
pumpkin
flavor
with
my
tiredness
of
pumpkin
beers
i
can
appreciate
this
one
overall
meh
this
is
a
decent
beer
when
your
pumpkin
ale
is
the
same
as
the
winter
warmer
style
im
not
really
enthused
this
brew
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
other
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tried
if
you
want
a
ton
of
ginger
this
is
for
you
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
starts
out
of
the
gate
at
a
full
on
sprint
and
then
seems
to
coast
a
bit
to
the
finish
line
i
love
the
appearance
and
smell
of
the
beer
like
the
taste
quite
a
bit
and
grew
a
little
tired
of
the
mouthfeel
as
i
finished
my
drink
that
being
said
i
would
likely
drink
this
one
again
next
season
should
the
opportunity
present
itself
if
there
is
anything
ive
learned
about
pumpkin
ales
after
trying
a
handful
of
different
brands
is
that
they
are
hit
or
miss
reviews
are
all
over
the
place
with
little
consensus
many
of
the
reviews
on
here
are
from
those
that
dislike
the
style
to
start
with
i
honestly
never
would
have
thought
to
buy
a
pumpkin
ale
and
was
sent
some
extras
in
a
trade
that
included
a
williamsburg
alewerks
pumpkin
ale
this
blew
my
mind
smuttynose
is
worth
trying
and
a
good
effort
as
a
huge
pumpkin
fan
im
impressed
with
smuttynose
offering
of
the
style
definitely
a
more
mild
pumpkin
offering
but
much
better
than
any
of
the
overly
spiced
sweetened
recipes
that
are
getting
thrown
around
every
time
these
kinds
of
beers
are
released
definitely
hit
the
spot
when
paired
with
a
squash
shrimp
stew
and
goat
cheese
we
made
that
night
but
on
its
own
its
a
little
too
simple
i
did
like
trying
it
however
and
i
would
gladly
have
it
again
if
offered
as
you
can
read
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
smuttynose
blue
moon
and
samuel
adams
are
at
the
bottom
of
my
pumpkin
ale
category
maple
mistress
is
another
pumpkin
ale
loser
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
but
tastes
like
a
maple
ale
i
guess
that
makes
it
an
imperial
maple
ale
this
beer
has
bright
orange
color
body
with
a
small
fizzy
head
the
smell
has
a
inviting
and
light
aroma
of
spice
and
pumpkin
the
taste
has
a
very
light
pumpkin
and
spice
taste
its
not
overpowering
but
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
overall
it
is
a
good
pumpkin
beer
o
it
was
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
pumpkin
beer
if
you
are
into
dark
beers
hoppy
and
ipa
than
this
would
be
the
right
beer
for
you
my
pour
created
a
dense
mound
finger
high
of
tawny
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
hazy
orangishamber
srm
9
nose
smelled
like
a
fresh
deck
of
clove
cigarettes
man
that
took
me
back
i
was
a
young
sailor
in
1983
and
smoking
was
the
vogue
of
the
time
i
disliked
anything
but
cloves
and
smoked
a
lot
of
them
with
early
girlfriends
many
of
whom
i
have
not
thought
of
until
now
they
were
all
always
blackclad
toughtalking
and
great
teachers
i
learned
a
lot
from
them
and
i
regret
none
of
it
its
only
kinky
the
first
time
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
clovecinnamon
presence
was
unrelenting
phew
i
am
feeling
pretty
festive
after
today
i
walked
away
from
this
for
a
moment
to
allow
the
spices
to
sink
in
but
coming
back
to
it
i
was
still
overwhelmed
by
the
spices
finish
was
dry
too
dry
for
my
taste
and
all
tanks
to
the
overabundance
of
spices
grab
a
sixpack
because
you
wont
be
satisfied
with
just
one
overall
this
one
just
misses
the
mark
i
like
the
more
subtle
flavors
but
the
bitterness
needs
to
be
dialed
back
a
bit
overall
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
that
i
have
enjoyed
over
the
years
good
stuff
overall
solid
subtle
pumpkin
ale
that
provides
nice
fall
flavors
while
not
being
overly
sweet
or
spicy
nice
balance
of
pumpkin
flavors
and
hop
bitterness
o
im
glad
i
gave
this
beer
a
second
chance
this
is
really
one
of
my
new
favorite
pumpkin
beers
for
the
an
easy
to
find
reasonably
priced
non
imperial
pumpkin
beer
just
a
nice
beer
to
grab
and
drink
on
a
nice
fall
day
like
today
and
watch
the
leaves
change
on
the
trees
and
because
its
so
balanced
i
could
drink
more
than
one
solid
and
definitely
an
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
nice
aroma
and
interesting
flavor
that
is
different
from
other
pumpkins
i
tried
im
not
sure
if
i
really
like
it
but
it
gets
points
for
originality
worth
a
try
we
are
on
a
taste
test
to
find
the
best
pumpkin
ale
for
fall
beer
of
choice
post
road
pumpkin
is
bitter
tasting
with
less
spice
then
others
ive
tired
this
is
no
a
pumpkin
ale
that
i
could
drink
all
night
i
always
willing
to
try
a
beer
once
have
a
great
day
finally
a
pumpkin
brew
thats
not
overspiced
this
one
is
still
spiced
but
i
can
taste
squash
too
and
it
really
works
orangey
amber
on
the
pours
with
just
under
an
inch
of
bubbly
airy
white
head
fades
fast
the
nose
is
clove
and
pumpkin
roasted
and
sweet
caramel
and
red
malts
and
ale
yeast
all
in
good
proportion
to
one
another
the
taste
is
great
understated
seasonally
perfect
spice
profile
hint
of
bitter
gourdy
flesh
and
a
brown
sugar
finish
that
tastes
rich
but
drinks
easy
lighter
in
body
than
many
pumpkin
ales
and
pleasantly
smooth
too
despite
assertive
carbonation
this
is
a
very
well
executed
pumpkin
brew
and
should
serve
as
an
example
to
others
how
to
use
spice
but
still
allow
pumpkins
to
shine
through
couple
of
pints
of
this
are
no
worries
12
ounce

to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
with
some
light
streaming
carbonation
aromas
of
big
pumpkin
clove
cinnamon

very

on
the

a
good

flavors
with
solid
robustness
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after

mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
good
balance
of
malt
and
spice
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
o
not
as
pumpkiny
as
other
pumpkin
ales
but
nice
to
drink
nonetheless
i
like
it
but
that
may
be
because
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
and
ive
drank
three
in
an
hour
o
pumpkin
ales
like
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
and
full
tilt
patterson
pumpkin
succeed
because
they
dont
succumb
to
the
pratfalls
of
the
style
while
not
necessarily
a
total
failure
this
one
doesnt
succeed
because
it
does
fall
victim
to
the
problems
of
the
style
too
much
bitter
spicing
not
enough
balance
between
the
sweet
and
aforementioned
bitter
my
first
real
letdown
from
smuttynose
but
to
be
fair
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
fantastic
a
great
pumpkin
beer
a
step
down
from
southern
tier
horseheads
and
schlafly
in
my
opinion
but
still
quite
excellent
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
just
doesnt
blow
you
away
ginger
is
not
my
favorite
flavor
in
a
beer
and
im
not
a
fan
of
harsh
bitterness
or
cola
so
this
isnt
my
favorite
seasonal
o
beautiful
from
the
getgo
this
pumpkin
ale
has
a
nice
introductory
aroma
that
quickly
becomes
off
with
unpleasant
wet
cardboard
though
not
oxidized
and
carries
slightly
into
the
bitter
astringent
flavor
and
feel
for
a
pumpkin
beer
thats
not
at
all
pleasing
to
drink
ive
had
15
different
pumpkin
ales
already
this
year
and
its
only
the
beginning
of
august
many
taste
very
similar
and
the
pumpkin
seems
thrown
in
there
without
much
concern
for
how
it
will
work
with
the
other
flavors
this
beer
is
different
the
appearance
is
nice
with
a
shortmedium
head
that
leaves
great
lacing
the
smell
is
not
as
sweet
and
bold
as
many
other
pumpkin
ales
and
theres
no
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
more
hops
than
what
im
used
to
in
a
pumpkin
ale
a
little
less
pumpkin
and
a
little
more
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
giving
it
a
spicy
taste
with
a
finish
thats
actually
more
dry
than
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
but
all
of
the
flavors
are
captured
nicely
and
it
goes
down
smooth
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
in
my
opinion
because
of
its
great
balance
well
formulated
and
executed
nearly
to
perfection
the
beer
does
exactly
what
it
was
designed
to
do
half
ale
and
half
pie
it
speaks
to
the
historic
nature
of
the
pumpkin
and
also
to
what
todays
craft
beer
has
turned
it
into
still
its
subtlety
is
a
far
cry
to
the
more
seductive
and
dessertlike
properties
of
more
assertive
newer
versions
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
golden
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
displays
moderate
retention
the
aroma
is
all
pie
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
all
spice
come
to
mind
light
sugary
malt
deep
underneath
with
a
hint
of
earth
the
flavor
is
a
little
tart
but
sweet
with
brown
sugar
and
flavored
with
pie
spices
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
spicy
tart
mouthfeel
its
a
pumpkin
beer
a
bit
too
light
in
body
and
sweetness
for
my
tastes
a
great
example
of
the
style
ive
reviewed
quite
a
few
pumpkin
beers
this
early
season
and
was
getting
discouraged
having
not
really
enjoyed
any
glad
i
tried
this
so
i
know
theres
still
hope
would
definitely
get
again
and
recommend
if
youre
looking
for
a
great
pumpkin
ale
with
a
lot
of
character
and
a
nice
balance
the
feel
is
very
light
and
bubbly
and
fills
the
mouth
with
a
wateriness
edged
elysian
also
very
good
out
to
be
the
best
pumpkin
yet
smuttynose
is
a
great
brewer
o
this
is
a
pumpkin
ale
anyone
could
enjoy
and
have
a
couple
while
youre
at
it
some
pumpkin
ales
are
hard
to
finish
and
thats
from
someone
who
loves
pumpkin
this
one
had
the
stuff
to
be
great
but
its
just
lacking
a
touch
of
flavor
for
me
to
go
that
far
take
nothing
away
from
the
smuttynose
pumpkin
ale
however
its
a
very
good
offering
for
the
upcoming
fall
season
definitely
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
this
is
one
that
id
drink
again
for
sure
i
like
this
beer
as
afore
mentioned
it
is
one
of
the
better
done
pumpkin
ales
schlafly
still
tops
the
list
for
me
thoughout
of
all
of
this
style
ive
had
definitely
worth
a
try
i
can
see
myself
coming
back
to
this
one
before
the
season
is
out
or
when
all
the
schlafly
pumpkin
sells
out
in
mid
september
look
is
a
great
unfiltered
yellow
with
pumpkin
highlights
smell
is
spicy
clove
pumpkin
and
herbal
hops
the
scents
jive
well
together
surprisingly
the
taste
is
similar
crisp
bready
malts
slight
pumpkin
sweetness
and
a
punch
of
spice
cinnamon
peppery
clove
and
a
healthy
dosing
of
hops
t
definitely
not
as
sweet
as
im
used
to
a
lot
of
pumpkin
beers
being
bready
malt
with
a
good
amount
of
spice
but
it
feels
a
bit
overspiced
theres
almost
so
much
spice
that
it
becomes
bitter
finish
is
very
bitter
and
a
touch
sour
vegetal
pumpkin
in
there
but
it
doesnt
really
taste
that
good
with
all
the
spice
not
a
terrible
pumpkin
beer
but
also
not
fantastic
only
other
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
was
shipyard
pumpkin
head
so
not
a
lot
to
compare
too
in
that
regaurd
overall
not
the
top
of
my
list
for
pumpkin
ales
this
is
definitely
the
spiciest
one
have
tasted
o
despite
an
unattractive
aroma
smuttynose
pumpkin
ale
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
ever
had
wish
id
bought
more
than
one
smuttynose
pumpkin
ale
3
55
overall
i
have
an
outside
thought
that
this
bottle
may
have
a
rogue
strain
of
something
in
it
that
is
turning
it
dry
and
bitter
some
five
months
after
halloween
best
before
13113
i
could
try
a
fresher
sample
this
season
smuttynose
beers
are
usually
spoton
but
the
spice
really
ruined
an
otherwise
great
beer
way
too
overwhelming
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
much
props
go
out
to
the
folks
at
smuttynose
this
one
is
definitely
suited
to
the
rustic
nature
of
autumn
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
an
off
white
head
nice
lacing
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
and
hops
creamy
mouthfeel
although
it
is
a
little
overly
carbonated
pumpkin
spices
and
a
nice
hop
finish
on
the
palate
i
am
looking
forward
to
puchasing
this
again
next
year
overall
it
was
a
nice
tasting
beer
not
as
slammed
with
pumpkin
pie
flavors
more
subtle
than
others
in
the
category
probably
not
in
the
permanent
rotationby
a
very
nice
brew
pours
a
murky
golden
caramel
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
that
soon
settles
into
patchy
blotches
aroma
is
vibrant
smelling
of
pumpkin
spices
especially
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
along
with
some
trace
hop
fragrance
bright
hop
flavor
is
surprisingly
dominant
up
front
in
spite
of
its
meager
presence
in
the
nose
the
pumpkin
spices
appear
to
clash
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
the
disharmony
is
distracting
there
is
also
a
wheatlike
funkiness
on
the
back
end
that
i
dont
particularly
care
for
the
carbonation
is
a
little
on
the
high
side
but
still
manages
to
facilitate
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
that
however
is
not
enough
to
offset
the
detractors
in
the
flavor
department
i
was
expecting
better
from
smuttynose
but
i
feel
they
missed
the
mark
a
bit
with
this
one
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
pumpkin
some
spice
taste
is
very
spicy
up
front
nutmeg
maybe
some
ginger
a
bit
of
pumpkin
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
not
bad
but
i
have
had
better
pumpkin
beers
o
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
that
ive
had
lots
of
flavors
going
on
and
more
complex
than
most
other
examples
ive
tried
great
for
the
stoner
o
this
one
tastes
more
like
an
actual
beer
than
the
likes
of
a
pumking
it
is
far
from
liquid
pumpkin
pie
but
is
still
a
solid
beer
that
said
i
would
still
choose
a
pumking
or
horseheads
pumpkin
ale
over
this
o
pretty
enjoyable
though
the
spice
flavors
are
a
little
more
dominant
than
the
pumpkin
making
it
seem
slightly
out
of
balance
and
easy
to
drink
overall
the
smuttynose
pumpkin
ale
is
a
good
pumpkin
beer
its
easy
to
drink
and
well
balanced
you
couldnt
go
wrong
picking
up
a
six
pack
a
true
masterpiece
among
pumpkin
beers
tastes
like
autumn
in
liquid
form
a
must
try
for
any
beer
enthusiast
smells
just
like
a
pumpkin
beer
when
you
open
it
good
consistency
and
tastes
great
when
you
take
a
sip
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
and
a
little
more
spicy
tasting
than
it
smells
overall
a
good
pumpkin
ale
definitely
a
tier
below
great
lakes
brewing
co
cleveland
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
and
souther
tier
pumpking
ale
i
would
rate
it
just
above
sam
adams
harvest
pumpkin
interesting
on
the
palate
quite
aggressive
bitterness
married
to
the
pumpkin
pie
spice
i
would
call
this
a
pumpkin
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
refreshing
and
i
think
overall
the
effect
is
pretty
nice
that
is
to
say
i
will
happily
drink
more
than
one
of
these
unlike
most
of
the
pumpkinspice
brews
out
there
and
it
would
actually
be
great
with
pumpkin
pie
at
the
end
of
thanksgiving
dinner
im
not
a
big
vegetablebeer
guy
but
this
is
definitely
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
tasted
i
think
the
key
is
the
subtlety
of
the
pumpkin
and
the
dry
wellbalanced
base
do
very
high
the
emphasis
is
on
beer
in
the
style
pumpkin
beer
here
definite
spices
of
the
season
which
is
nice
but
a
good
malt
backbone
and
great
hop
profile
are
the
stars
of
the
show
here
id
buy
this
by
the
case
o
i
found
myself
dangling
the
glass
upside
down
to
catch
the
last
drops
on
my
tongue
this
is
a
deliciously
wellrounded
beer
that
never
forgets
that
it
is
first
and
foremost
a
beer
and
not
a
pumpkin
latte
ill
be
stocking
up
for
winter
o
this
is
a
really
nice
pumpkin
beer
that
accomplishes
something
that
not
many
pumpkinfruit
beers
do
it
has
a
very
strong
presence
from
the
base
beer
many
fruitvegetable
beers
are
overloaded
with
their
respective
fruitsvegetables
and
the
things
that
actually
make
them
beers
are
left
by
the
wayside
not
so
with
this
one
grainy
bready
malt
is
apparent
in
the
aroma
and
taste
and
earthy
floral
hops
are
certainly
apparent
at
the
finish
of
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
the
pumpkin
and
spices
serve
to
add
to
the
beer
not
replace
it
smuttynose
did
a
really
nice
job
with
this
one
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
citrus
hops
slight
pumpkin
spice
all
spice
clove
and
nutmeg
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
a
strong
dryness
from
excess
spice
fits
the
style
of
a
pumpkin
ale
tastes
of
strong
spice
citrus
hops
slight
pumpkin
and
slight
sweet
malt
overall
good
appearance
aroma
and
body
but
the
blend
is
overtly
spicecentric
o
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
top
3
in
my
pumpkin
beer
experience
so
far
overall
this
brew
renews
some
of
my
faith
in
pumpkin
beer
you
dont
get
that
overthetop
pumpkinbomb
taste
but
its
still
delicious
and
well
balanced
nothing
artificial
tasting
here
which
i
get
with
a
lot
of
pumpkin
brews
well
done
worth
a
try
o
behind
dc
brau
epics
fermentation
without
representation
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
tried
and
i
hate
pumpkin
beers
one
of
my
favorite
autumn
beers
which
i
intend
to
buy
more
of
before
winter
hits
this
pours
up
a
beautiful
orange
color
just
as
you
would
expect
a
pumpkin
ale
to
it
was
nice
in
the
nose
with
the
usual
pumpkin
spices
with
a
light
sweetness
the
taste
follows
and
boy
was
this
one
crisp
and
refreshing
fall
in
a
bottle
im
in
florida
now
but
this
took
me
back
to
the
crisp
autumn
of
the
north
this
is
the
beallendall
of
normal
abv
pumpkin
beers
i
tried
about
ten
different
pumpkin
beers
this
season
and
there
was
not
even
a
contender
to
this
look
no
further
chaps
this
one
is
it
d
this
is
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
very
pleasant
i
would
say
this
is
an
average
pumpkin
ale
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
that
doesnt
succumb
to
temptations
of
the
mass
market
varients
of
this
style
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
spicey
with
a
focus
on
the
pumpkin
itself
but
a
bitter
components
come
off
as
potentially
unintentional
and
possibly
unwanted
holding
it
back
from
greatness
but
adding
some
balance
o
another
good
showing
from
smutty
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
come
across
but
certainly
one
worth
my
time
the
appearance
is
nice
a
great
golden
orange
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
for
a
pumpkin
ale
o
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
out
of
the
ones
ive
tried
this
would
be
my
favorite
would
certainly
buy
again
next
fall
would
have
liked
just
a
bit
more
pumpkin
flavor
but
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
the
nose
was
good
but
the
flavor
was
off
the
flavor
was
far
too
bitter
with
a
grainy
maltyness
the
pumpkin
and
spices
are
there
but
theyre
overpowered
in
the
end
im
disappointed
overall
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
it
does
not
over
do
it
with
pumpkin
nor
spice
overall
id
like
touch
more
sweetness
and
a
touch
less
clove
still
a
good
beer
that
is
well
worth
trying
id
reach
for
something
else
next
time
though
o
i
will
never
be
a
big
pumpkin
fan
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
one
in
my
opinion
that
ive
tried
i
think
it
will
work
well
with
milder
foods
or
a
cool
evening
on
the
deck
highly
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
that
simultaneously
covers
ones
hankerings
for
pumpkin
and
fall
beers
glad
i
picked
up
a
few
to
supplement
my
already
substantial
pumpkin
beer
list
oi
am
glad
that
i
picked
this
up
this
is
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
but
it
is
very
good
sessionable
and
as
with
all
smuttynose
brews
i
have
tried
a
good
value
i
will
be
interested
to
see
what
my
wife
thinks
of
it
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
right
now
im
wishing
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
o
by
far
one
of
the
top
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
from
such
an
underrated
brewer
not
watery
at
all
has
a
nice
sweet
creamy
flavor
that
you
can
savor
not
quite
pumpkin
pie
esk
but
very
good
all
natural
type
beer
toasted
nutty
grains
up
front
vegetal
spicy
bitterness
follows
caramel
and
pumpkin
puree
malts
fill
in
the
palate
lightly
sweet
the
aforementioned
spices
pick
up
the
tail
end
into
the
finish
lingering
caramel
spicy
bitterness
and
pumpkin
in
the
finish
mediumfull
body
with
a
thickish
pulpy
feel
nicely
balanced
and
not
too
spicy
d
the
epitome
of
fall
beer
to
me
great
pumpkin
ale
with
enough
spice
and
pumpkin
presence
to
remain
balanced
and
drinkable
i
think
in
this
pumpkin
the
got
it
so
the
pumpkin
is
in
front
of
the
spice
this
is
important
many
just
taste
like
a
holiday
brew
with
tons
of
spice
others
have
unusual
creaminess
and
a
pie
like
taste
this
one
is
more
like
a
flavorful
ale
and
one
you
could
drink
several
of
without
tiring
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
o
one
of
the
better
staple
pumpkin
beers
out
there
really
an
homage
to
the
style
when
it
was
made
for
the
craft
community
and
not
marketing
spin
for
the
fall
very
enjoyable
if
nothing
else
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
low
abv
means
you
could
take
down
a
whole
six
pack
if
one
wanted
having
said
that
the
aftertaste
is
very
distracting
to
me
worth
a
try
for
pumpkin
beer
fans
you
may
enjoy
than
i
this
beer
has
a
golden
amber
color
but
is
a
bit
cloudy
but
who
really
cares
when
it
tastes
so
good
o
wellrounded
flavors
and
a
solid
abv
make
this
brew
a
solid
choice
for
your
pumpkin
beer
of
choice
for
the
season
very
enjoyable
and
doesnt
overwhelm
with
pumpkin
pie
flavors
or
spices
like
some
other
pumpkin
beers
can
very
well
done
pgh
pa
good
beer
for
drinking
around
a
fall
time
campfire
feels
medium
to
full
in
body
somewhat
refreshing
to
the
palate
but
complex
enough
to
need
to
take
another
quick
sip
to
see
where
this
brew
goes
next
o
definitely
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
not
too
harsh
flavors
well
balanced
edits
reviewing
pumpkin
beers
and
pumpkin
notes
i
had
to
downgrade
this
slightly
but
ill
give
it
this
my
friends
cleaned
out
a
case
at
party
in
short
time
d
better
than
most
of
what
passes
for
pumpkin
ale
out
there
but
nothing
truly
mindblowing
a
good
beer
overall
nice
example
of
my
favorite
style
id
recommend
it
oa
let
down
from
smuttynose
it
just
loses
so
much
focus
on
the
flavors
theres
a
lot
of
bitterness
here
that
would
be
more
welcomed
if
it
didnt
overpower
the
rest
of
the
beer
its
a
decent
drinker
overall
ah
it
was
a
nice
beer
to
try
but
not
one
i
would
really
go
to
on
any
occasion
original

o
maybe
my
favourite
pumpkin
ale
because
i
prefer
the
drier
grassy
approach
i
dont
like
pumpkin
ales
that
try
to
mimic
pumpkin
pie
with
too
much
diacetyl
o
very
crisp
and
refreshing
but
is
not
your
typical
pumpkin
ale
rather
than
pumpkin
pie
and
spice
flavors
this
takes
a
more
vegetal
approach
with
allspice
and
pumpkin
rind
nice
bitterness
with
a
definite
hop
presence
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
o
its
a
little
off
too
many
spices
not
enough
pumpkin
perhaps
mouthfeel
is
almost
refreshing
watery
for
the
most
part
with
a
bit
of
dirty
boot
o
not
the
greatest
pumpkin
beer
similar
to
others
but
a
bit
too
malty
for
my
taste
enjoyed
in
a
pint
glass
on
1812
brew
pours
a
clear
rusty
amber
color
under
a
fairly
consistent
head
pumpkin
puree
and
spices
o
i
wish
the
spiciness
came
through
more
on
flavor
otherwise
a
pretty
good
beer
d
this
was
more
of
a
mediocre
pale
ale
than
a
pumpkin
ale
with
not
very
strong
spicing
the
scent
and
taste
were
ok
but
not
great
the
body
was
very
average
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
but
was
ultimately
a
really
poor
example
of
the
style
not
recommended
poured
from
a
bottle
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
hazy
orangebrown
coloring
that
pours
with
a
halfinch
of
biege
foamy
light
head
that
disappears
before
i
make
it
back
to
my
seat
from
the
kitchen
light
enticing
aromas
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
an
overall
roasted
quality
the
beer
has
a
light
slick
cling
on
the
glass
that
slides
down
with
the
level
of
the
brew
while
you
drink
flavors
are
a
bit
more
on
the
roasted
side
initially
with
some
tangy
and
sweet
character
blended
through
the
pumpkin
profiles
the
spicing
is
much
lighter
than
the
aromas
would
lead
you
to
believe
would
be
present
the
beers
body
is
much
lighter
than
most
other
brews
in
this
style
a
slight
hopping
seems
out
of
place
at
the
end
of
the
palate
causing
a
sharp
drying
and
crisping
feel
at
the
end
of
the
brew
o
this
is
probably
the
most
disappointing
pumpkin
ale
i
have
come
across
im
a
big
fan
of
most
things
pumpkin
but
this
attempt
falls
very
short
in
my
opinion
a
stronger
brew
for
those
months
when
it
starts
to
get
a
little
cooler
out
and
dark
earlier
poured
from
the
bottle
deep
orange
amber
pour
with
a
cloudy
look
and
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
pumpkin
spice
vegetable
aroma
with
a
light
toasted
malt
smell
right
away
there
are
flavors
of
cinnamon
allspice
and
clove
along
with
some
pumpkin
and
vegetable
and
malt
while
i
gave
it
a
few
4
ratings
the
taste
was
off
putting
enough
to
reduce
it
a
bit
overall
impression
a
very
nice
spice
and
cinnamon
combo
beer
but
doesnt
hit
much
of
a
pumpkin
flavor
i
do
enjoy
the
body
and
mouthfeel
of
this
one
though
could
definitely
enjoy
this
one
again
one
of
my
top
10
favorite
pumpkin
ales
o
definitely
disappointed
i
get
very
little
pumpkin
its
essentially
a
light
hopbomb
with
a
nutmeg
aftertaste
i
will
not
be
returning
to
this
beer
o
if
you
prefer
a
more
hoppy
pumpkin
ale
this
is
for
you
surprisingly
bitter
most
pumpkin
ales
have
almost
no
hop
flavor
tastes
more
like
a
beer
than
a
pumpkin
whereas
most
pumpkin
ales
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
its
a
nice
departure
but
honestly
i
prefer
the
more
pumpkin
pie
style
ales
a
standard
for
the
style
flavorful
but
not
flashy
perfect
for
thanksgiving
dinner
because
i
had
high
expectations
and
they
were
immediately
shot
down
this
quickly
turned
into
one
of
my
least
favorite
beers
ive
had
overall
not
your
typical
pumpkin
ale
i
found
it
rather
bland
with
too
much
of
a
bitter
bite
at
the
end
and
not
enough
flavor
from
the
spices
or
the
pumpkin
nothing
to
see
here
folks
a
middling
pumpkin
brew
overall
this
is
the
benchmark
by
which
all
other
pumpkin
beers
are
based
incredibly
balanced
and
well
crafted
simple
in
its
construction
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
the
drinker
happy
truly
a
standout
from
smuttynose
o
it
has
so
much
potential
but
its
not
there
this
a
very
pleasant
ale
with
good
smells
and
flavorful
transitions
in
taste
of
all
the
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
this
year
this
seems
the
most
alelike
and
least
generically
sweet
and
pumpkinpielike
ive
been
buying
this
every
fall
since
i
turned
21
its
not
jawdropping
in
any
way
but
its
about
as
wellrounded
as
a
pumpkin
ale
can
be
its
definitely
something
to
look
forward
to
in
the
fall
and
im
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
it
overall
pretty
solid
pumpkin
flavors
without
being
overly
spicedsweet
however
it
had
a
strange
mineral
note
and
was
overly
earthychalky
o
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
worth
trying
this
or
any
autumn
not
the
best
around
but
still
worth
a
try
and
then
theres
everything
else
pours
a
semiclear
rustic
orange
color
with
a
thin
head
scent
is
mild
with
pumpkin
scents
and
bready
wheats
maybe
a
slight
bananna
this
pumpkin
beer
has
some
bite
to
it
i
dont
notice
the
pumpkin
flavor
as
much
as
i
notice
the
hops
there
is
some
pumpkin
flavor
to
it
but
really
has
a
very
bitter
hops
taste
to
it
a
refreshing
taste
that
is
interesting
but
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
a
pumpkin
beer
to
be
like
decent
but
still
no
pumpking
think
this
might
be
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
12
inch
head
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
you
can
smell
this
beer
from
about
a
foot
away
pumpkin
bread
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
its
an
amazingly
aromatic
beer
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
nice
dry
finish
i
like
that
it
is
not
too
sweet
and
has
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
cant
say
enough
good
things
about
this
one
this
is
a
medium
bodies
brew
with
a
pretty
smooth
feel
modest
carbonation
throughout
poduces
a
light
and
easy
drinking
offering
perhaps
the
most
enjoyable
aspects
of
this
brew
were
the
looks
and
the
feel
the
abv
was
well
integrated
except
for
the
fruit
touch
that
came
out
once
warm
not
bad
worth
a
try
if
you
are
looking
to
enjoy
a
flavorful
pumpkin
you
can
look
elsewhere
based
on
positive
reviews
there
must
be
a
crowd
that
is
looking
for
this
flavor
i
wont
be
having
another
one
of
these
overall
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
could
use
a
little
more
body
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
o
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
this
fall
i
enjoy
that
that
the
flavors
seem
authentic
and
everything
is
very
balanced
overall
a
little
rough
but
not
bad
for
a
pumpkin
ale
it
could
be
great
with
food
on

at
the
dutch

very

a

not
a
bad
brew
here
but
pumpkin
beers
are
a
strange
invention
in
that
if
you
truly
make
your
beer
taste
like
pumpkin
it
will
be
mild
bordering
on
flavorless
its
a
strange
food
to
base
beers
on
at
least
this
beer
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
with
spices
like
some
other
pumpkins
moreys
bottom
line
this
is
a
hearty
full
flavored
pumpkin
ale
might
not
want
to
start
your
miller
light
drinking
friends
off
with
this
one
i
had
it
on
tap
a
few
weeks
ago
and
it
was
a
little
cleaner
i
prefer
this
one
on
draft
although
the
bottle
is
definitely
tasty
too
cheers
o
shockingly
good
this
is
the
pale
ale
lovers
pumpkin
ale
not
the
best
pumpkin
ales
but
im
willing
to
give
it
a
go
again
in
respect
to
the
season
o
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
not
overpowering
and
still
containing
some
very
assertive
hops
good
to
have
a
beer
that
combines
the
maltiness
inherent
in
pumpkin
ales
while
not
skipping
out
on
the
hops
seriously
ive
been
having
to
alternate
ipas
with
my
pumpkin
ales
just
so
i
can
get
some
hops
i
only
bought
a
single
of
this
at
my
local
total
wine
but
i
have
a
feeling
theres
a
sixer
in
my
near
future
overall
this
one
really
starts
off
well
in
appearance
and
aromas
but
comes
up
a
bit
short
in
the
key
categories
its
an
enjoyable
beer
but
wouldnt
be
my
recommendation
for
a
traditional
pumpkin
ale
do
drinkability
is
moderate
i
had
hopes
for
this
beer
after
the
nose
but
the
taste
just
has
it
unravel
a
bit
too
much
while
each
flavor
is
pleasant
the
beer
doesnt
let
you
savor
one
specific
ingredient
before
blasting
you
with
another
not
my
favorite
beer
in
the
style
and
it
seems
weyerbachers
still
leads
the
pack
for
me
pours
a
hazy
dark
pumpkinorange
with
an
inch
fluffy
offwhite
head
good
lacing
and
great
looking
smell
is
earthy
but
pumpkins
as
well
no
major
spicy
scents
are
noticed
this
brew
has
a
wellbalanced
taste
and
is
another
pumpkin
ale
that
was
able
to
capture
the
notes
of
the
natural
pumpkin
squash
accurately
the
nutmeg
spices
sit
in
the
background
and
are
not
offensive
in
the
least
way
very
smooth
feel
with
low
carbonation
and
no
hint
of
alcohol
pretty
good
job
here
by
smuttynose
and
this
seasonal
of
theirs
seems
to
be
consistently
good
each
year
o
one
of
the
best
of
fall
2011
o
an
excellent
pumpkin
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
that
i
have
tis
the
season
o
my
favorite
non
imperial
pumpkin
probably
the
most
sessionable
fallwinter
seasonal
ive
ever
had
pumpkin
flavor
without
dumping
in
barrels
of
spices
that
mute
the
flavors
well
crafted
brew
my
first
choice
for
pumpkin
6
pack
o
fairly
drinkable
because
of
the
hops
and
absence
of
sweetness
color
is
a
muted
orange
with
a
large
white
head
smell
is
not
overwhelming
like
a
lot
of
the
styleyou
actually
smell
pumpkin
and
some
hops
and
youre
not
getting
beaten
down
by
cinnamon
a
pleasant
change
the
hops
are
there
in
the
taste
too
with
fresh
pumpkin
and
some
malt
medium
body
not
too
much
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
because
its
not
a
pumpkin
pie
ale
as
a
lot
of
othersnot
that
i
like
it
exclusively
but
its
a
nice
mixup
and
good
at
the
price
point
something
i
look
forward
too
each
year
overall
i
actually
really
like
this
one
the
hops
are
a
welcome
note
and
the
pumpkin
instead
of
pumpkin
pie
flavour
is
really
doing
it
for
me
good
gourd
this
is
good
o
not
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
and
not
a
very
good
beer
period
i
am
not
digging
this
beer
the
color
and
aroma
were
great
but
my
taste
buds
just
cant
take
this
medicinal
minty
hop
assault
its
like
all
thoughts
of
pumpkin
are
washed
away
as
soon
as
the
beer
hits
your
tongue
usually
i
love
the
stuff
coming
out
of
smuttynose
but
this
was
not
delivering
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
pumpkin
the
alcohol
wasnt
overpowering
but
i
would
have
toned
it
down
a
bit
as
i
never
like
to
feel
too
warmed
up
when
drinking
something
like
this
there
are
so
many
beers
like
this
available
now
this
only
should
only
be
enjoyed
by
the
diehards
of
the
style
spicy
beers
are
never
fun
when
belched
afterwards
and
this
was
no
exception
id
only
recommend
having
this
to
better
appreciate
other
beer
that
are
currently
available
overall
this
beer
looked
and
smelled
great
but
has
too
much
bite
to
really
enjoy
overall
a
complex
and
tasty
pumpkin
ale
to
me
this
is
a
great
beer
that
features
pumpkin
as
opposed
to
other
pumpkin
ales
which
to
me
seem
to
be
brewers
trying
to
use
pumpkin
to
make
a
great
beer
this
bright
copper
colored
offering
came
with
a
thin
line
of
head
that
dissipated
quickly
i
noticed
that
the
ontap
version
had
a
bit
stronger
aroma
of
pumpkin
than
the
bottled
variety
hops
are
also
noticeable
in
the
nose
which
is
unusual
but
not
at
all
disturbing
for
a
pumpkin
ale
there
is
also
plenty
of
hop
goodness
in
the
taste
as
well
those
who
dislike
extremely
spicy
pumpkin
ales
will
be
happy
to
know
that
this
certainly
does
not
occur
with
this
beer
in
fact
the
shortage
of
pie
spice
may
be
the
only
thing
this
pumpkin
offering
is
lacking
imho
the
clean
and
bitter
hop
finish
is
also
somewhat
odd
for
the
style
but
it
simply
works
here
in
sum
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
the
good
folks
at
smutty
o
i
like
the
pumpkin
flavor
but
the
hops
is
a
little
strong
for
what
i
was
looking
for
still
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
for
the
good
flavor
i
could
really
breathe
it
in
a
long
time
too
love
the
smell
of
it
this
is
the
most
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
and
i
like
that
its
not
very
sweet
nor
overwhelmingly
spicy
recommended
odi
really
like
smuttynoses
hop
profile
in
most
of
their
beers
i
think
it
is
cool
that
they
made
a
hoppy
bitter
pumpkin
beer
i
dont
know
if
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
but
i
do
enjoy
it
more
than
i
was
expecting
to
not
your
average
pumpkin
ale
othe
only
beer
of
the
tasting
that
had
resemblances
to
beer
i
could
get
hops
and
malts
out
of
the
taste
really
impressed
by
this
a
great
take
on
the
pumpkin
ale
o
pretty
tasty
but
the
spiciness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
o
a
good
pumpkin
ale
that
stands
out
from
the
crowd
by
having
both
a
nice
pumpkin
presence
along
with
the
spices
and
a
decent
hop
kick
many
thanks
to
mdaschaf
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
one
im
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
and
of
smuttynose
so
looking
forward
to
this
poured
from
bottle
into
dfh
snifter
pours
a
terrific
dark

slowly
reduced
to
a

included

flavors
and
aromas
were
more
delicate
than
most
pumpkins
ive
tried
this
is
probably
the
most

character
ive
also
tasted
in
a
pumpkin
before
overall
just
average
nothin
to
write

about
here
overall
impression
nice
spices
followed
by
sweet
malts
and
pumpkin
nice
and
bold
enough
flavor
yet
very
drinkable
o
this
beer
looks
phenomenal
the
taste
was
a
bit
overpowered
by
hop
bitterness
i
didnt
get
as
much
of
the
pumpkin
and
spice
as
i
would
have
liked
the
mouthfeel
was
solid
though
overall
this
was
pretty
good
and
better
than
the
southampton
pumpkin
ale
even
though
there
isnt
established
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
or
taste
it
still
glows
orange
in
the
light
and
has
a
pumpkin
photograph
on
the
bottle
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
beer
again
there
are
too
many
more
pumpkin
ales
left
for
me
to
try
this
beer

liked
that

instead
of
the
typical
pie

flavor
i
also
liked
how
some

flavors
came
through

mixed
with
the

so

this
was
a

i
didnt

above

and
a

of
alcohol

i
get
farther

that
it
seems
overspiced
however
considering
its
a
little

its

ill
cut
this

some
slack
still
not
terrible
not
unbalanced
flavor
smooth
and
drinkable

another
good
one
from
the

at

a

this

with

kinda
looks

smells
of

some

and
clove
and
hops
the
pineycitric
hops
are
more
bitter
than
i
expected
but
i
like
the
hop
kick
theres
also
malts
and
notes
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
cloves
and
a
touch
of
cinnamon
in
the
background
the
accumulated
spices
in
the
last
sip
numb
my
mouth
a
bit
the
body
is
medium
and
very
smooth
like
their
ipa
and
you
can
tell
its
unfiltered
a
good
version
of
a
pumpkin
maybe
it
fits
best
in
a
time
and
a
place
but
it
certainly
fits
them
well
granted
if
you
dont
like
the
fragrant
earthiness
of
pumpkin
pie
then
this
one
wont
make
it
for
you
but
if
you
do
it
will
be
a
crisp
seasonal
treat
in
fact
im
lucky
because
it
is
indeed
my
cup
of
tea
so
to
speak
its
pretty
with
a
clovey
sweet
goodness
and
its
a
drinkable
dose
of
pumpkiny
pleasance
im
liking
it
and
will
continue
to
all
fall
overall
i
love
pumpkin
ales
this
time
of
year
and
this
is
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
one
of
the
few
where
i
taste
pumpkin
seperate
and
not
just
pumpkin
pie
peppery
spices
are
strong
and
begin
to
hinder
me
though
very
good
but
if
its
sitting
beside
the
dfh
punkin
id
go
the
route
of
the
dfh
served
in
a
tulip
this
is
a
bright
orange
beer
very
pumpkinlike
actually
a
thin
beige
head
small
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
spiceynutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
a
slight
pumpkin
note
taste
is
very
nice
a
sweet
light
malt
infused
with
pumpkin
followed
by
a
wash
of
brown
sugar
nutmeg
cinnamon
pepper
and
ginger
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
and
is
rather
dry
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
definitely
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
smells
of
pumpkin
and
spices
just
as
one
might
expect
pours
a
medium
amberorange
semicloudy
color
with
little
head
not
much
carbonation
tastes
mostly
of
spices
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
i
would
have
liked
to
have
a
stronger
pumpkin
taste
but
considering
this
is
my
first
pumpkin
ale
i
have
little
to
compare
it
to
overall
this
is
a
really
nicely
balanced
very
drinkable
beer
definitely
looking
forward
to
trying
other
smuttynose
brews
the
flavor
has
a
little
more
spice
than
the
nose
suggests
but
not
much
the
finish
actually
reveals
more
pumpkin
all
in
all
a
good
ale
but
not
a
great
pumpkin
ale
its
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
light
to
medium
body
so
buy
a
six
and
watch
some
tv
because
this
isnt
great
for
sipping
pour
dark
amber
with
not
much
head
but
good
lacing
nose
consists
of
some
nice
spice
aroma
along
with
a
slight
bit
of
hops
taste
is
much
stronger
and
fuller
than
other
pumpkin
ales
most
are
light
sweet
and
fake
this
one
is
maltier
with
hints
of
spice
and
hints
of
pumpkin
i
would
like
more
pumpkin
flavor
in
here
but
it
was
enough
to
get
the
idea
bitterness
rounds
out
the
beer
to
give
it
enough
oomph
to
actually
be
an
ale
altogether
im
impressed
considering
its
competition
good
brew
drinkability
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
curl
up
on
the
couch
with
on
a
cool
autumn
night
while
record
after
record
spins
away
on
the
turn
table
ah
after
a
string
of
craptastic
pumpkin
ales
we
come
across
another
that
is
worthy
its
becoming
the
cool
rainy
part
of
october
here
in
philly
as
i
see
more
pumpkins
appearing
on
doorsteps
hence
its
time
for
another
pumpkin
ale
this
one
pours
a
very
hazy
peach
with
tiny
floaties
nutmeg
cream
and
pumpkin
pie
in
the
nose
unlike
some
of
its
lessthantasty
brethren
this
one
lacks
artificial
sweetness
to
balance
the
spice
and
uses
a
thick
malt
backbone
instead
spices
is
soft
and
certainly
not
overdone
its
much
more
apparent
at
the
start
as
the
finish
is
mildly
bitter
and
finishes
chewy
malty
and
dry
id
like
a
bit
more
spice
throughout
but
thats
about
my
only
complaint
medium
bodied
light
on
the
booze
and
carbonation
and
one
id
certainly
love
to
pair
with
some
pumpkin
pie
ill
have
more
of
this
come

it
is

not

pungent
the
taste
consisted
mainly
of
cinnamon

spice
the
pumpkin
was
there
but
it
in
the
background
which
isnt
such
a
bad
thing
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
easy
on
the
palate
with
very
subtle
aromas
and
flavors
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
that
fits
the
season
well
i
must
admit
im
impressed
with
this
pumpkin
ale
from
smutty
it
has
a
real
pumpkin
smell
and
taste
as
opposed
to
just
spices
its
well
balanced
has
some
hop
presence
and
dammit
i
just
like
it
moth
feel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
and
is
generously
carbonated
poured
a
cloudy
amber
in
color
with
a
bit
of
an
orange
tint
not
much
of
a
head
bits
os
spotted
lace
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
nose
is
absolutely
awesoe
loads
of
freshly
cut
pumpkins
and
buckets
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
unfortunately
the
flavor
does
not
match
the
aroma
there
is
the
pumpkin
and
spie
but
it
tastes
more
as
if
the
pie
has
gone
bad
kind
of
sour
and
bilelike
light
bodied
i
like
the
nose
in
this
beer
a
lot
but
the
flavor
knocks
this
beer
down
a
notch
notes
im
normally
not
a
big
fan
of
american
brewed
beers
but
i
would
definately
get
this
again
a
great
brew
from
smuttynose
poured
out
to
a
slightly
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
nice
1
inch
foamy
head
some
lacing
around
the
glass
aromas
are
laden
with
spices
pumpkin
and
sweetness
a
truely
exceptional
aroma
taste
is
nearly
consistant
with
the
aroma
flavors
of
sweet
veggies
pumpkin
spice
and
a
solid
earthy
character
i
must
say
that
out
of
the
many
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
albeit
ive
not
reviewed
many
this
one
really
does
have
the
pumpking
flavor
and
vibe
going
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
along
the
lines
of
a
well
crafted
ale
with
the
carbonation
making
the
brew
more
enjoyable
each
sip
the
drinkability
is
high
as
this
would
be
an
ideal
brew
to
drink
on
a
crisp
autumn
evening
highly
recommended
overall
i
rank
this
one
right
with
post
roads
version
recommended
for
fans
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
it
again
the
sour
aftertaste
just
drops
it
down
a
bit
dogfish
heads
punkin
ale
is
by
far
the
best
of
this
style
ive
tried
in

pale

beer
one
of
the
better
ones

d
true
to
new
england
one
of
the
few
pumpkin
ales
i
could
drink
all
night
long
smuttynose
pumpkin
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
spicy
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
some
clove
flavors
coming
through
in
the
aftertaste
nice
balance
of
spices
with
a
firm
maltypumpkin
backbone
medium
to
full
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
i
find
spice
beers
to
be
not
all
that
drinkable
but
the
spice
here
is
toned
down
enough
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
golden
ale
with
an
orangish
glow
very
much
like
a
pumpkin
beer
appears
in
my
mind
the
small
head
doesnt
last
too
long
but
leaves
some
attractive
residue
although
when
cold
the
smell
came
off
as
annoying
upon
warming
a
pleasant
melding
of
the
spices
fruit
and
floral
hoppage
appeared
a
good
very
slightly
sweet
bready
mediumbig
bodied
ale
with
rounded
flavors
just
the
right
amount
of
the
twangy
rotund
orange
fruit
my
palate
is
not
too
good
with
the
spices
but
it
seems
like
a
decent
amount
of
cinnamon
in
here
could
be
nutmeg
i
guess
i
need
a
culinary
course
or
two
either
way
it
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
could
drink
about
12
ounces
of
onceinawhile
on
a
fall
day
before
those
spices
grow
old
not
really
my
thing
but
it
is
done
well
and
i
can
respect
that
oelergud
overall
i
love
pumpkin
ales
and
this
was
my
first
try
with
this
one
it
does
a
great
job
of
letting
the
pumpkin
characteristics
come
through
without
just
turning
into
a
crummy
spice
bomb
that
drinks
like
liquid
nutmeg
highly
recommended
excellent
drinkability
i
would
purchase
another
or
a
6
pack
or
a
case
you
know
what
you
want
when
you
crack
a
pumpkin
ale
and
smuttynose
delivers
drinkability
moderate
the
spices
are
a
bit
too
prominent
to
go
back
to
too
many
of
these
at
a
time
but
i
do
like
the
flavor
and
it
doesnt
feel
like
a
very
hefty
brew
i
could
mix
a
couple
of
these
in
with
a
couple
other
autumn
seasonals
any
time
medium
bodied
very
well
balanced
as
it
doesnt
hide
the
beer
behind
the
pumpkin
a
nice
surprise
murky
looking
copper
appearance
small
dirty
white
head
lacing
is
minimal
cinamon
allspice
and
sweet
malt
on
the
nose
theres
a
definite
clove
presence
on
the
buds
a
little
cinamon
malts
give
some
depth
and
sweetness
some
pumpkin
flavor
is
present
but
its
not
heavy
by
any
means
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
moderately
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
a
beer
id
go
back
to
more
than
once
if
it
were
available
here
in
the
fall
smuttynose
pumpkin
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
to
have
yet
crossed
my
lips
this
brewery
brews
goodgreat
beer
and
this
particular
seasonal
is
simply
further
evidence
of
that
fact
i
seriously
doubt
that
ill
ever
find
a
better
pumpkin
beer
thanks
to
far333
for
the
bottle
pours
an
appropriately
orangeamber
hue
with
light
beige
head
smells
of
spicecinnamon
clove
nutmeg
and
grainy
bready
malts
tastes
very
nice
light
and
thirstquenching
far
more
subdued
spice
profile
than
some
other
pumpkin
brews
makes
this
a
bit
easier
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
hop
bite
at
the
finish
if
you
want
an
overthetop
pumpkin
beer
go
for
a
dfh
punk
this
one
is
more
subtle
and
more
approachable
well
done
thanks
to
monk
for
a
scrap
from
his
table
cheers
goes
very
smooth
and
creamy
since
the
spices
are
muted
there
is
a
good
chance
that
you
would
enjoy
having
several
finishes
relatively
clean
with
a
hint
of
cloying
sweetness
and
spice
would
go
very
well
all
alone
or
with
a
desert
or
two
this
may
be
a
good
beer
for
anyone
that
doesnt
really
like
beer
or
wants
to
try
something
totally
different
beer
overall
its
interesting
and
worth
a
try
interesting
orange
soda
color
fresh
aroma
that
reminds
me
of
juicyfruit
gum
similar
fruitysweet
notes
in
the
flavor
this
interpretation
is
not
going
for
the
pumpkin
pie
thing
rather
more
of
a
general
fruit
beer
theme
maybe
just
a
bit
of
nutmeg
in
there
not
something
id
want
a
lot
of
but
i
found
myself
pretty
much
drinking
the
whole
glass
trying
to
get
a
handle
on
the
flavors
12
ouncer
with
a
notch
on
the
label
no
clue
what
it
signafies
however
orangy
amber
with
a
white
head
shows
decent
retention
and
streams
of
bubbles
rising
up
respectable
lacing
slight
spicey
nose
medium
bodied
malty
center
expected
pumpkin
flavors
fairly
well
concealed
much
to
my
pleasure
in
the
rear
up
front
is
just
a
touch
of
spicing
and
a
slight
pumpkin
note
as
the
pumpkin
theme
is
quite
mild
and
reserved
i
enjoyed
this
take
on
a
style
that
really
doesnt
do
it
for
me
this
is
obviously
a
wellcrafted
pumpkin
ale
i
have
only
ever
had
one
other
one
though
if
you
want
real
but
not
overpowering
pumpkin
taste
then
you
should
go
for
this
one
i
am
actually
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
flavoredproducts
in
general
so
i
probably
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
my
review
numbers
indicate
but
rating
per
style
it
gets
high
marks
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
slight
off
white
head
aroma
is
of
spice
and
malt
taste
is
nice
malty
upfront
with
the
typical
pumpkin
pie
spice
flavour
however
unlike
some
pumpkin
beers
this
is
not
so
over
powering
also
hops
come
in
at
the
end
to
help
dry
out
the
sweetness
and
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
is
nicely
balanced
but
seemed
a
bit
grainy
to
me
also
seemed
a
bit
thinner
than
some
of
the
pumpkin
ales
drinkability
is
ok
but
like
most
pumpkin
beers
one
or
two
is
enough
as
they
tend
to
get
too
much
after
a
while
slightly
hazy
copper
with
a
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
spicey
pumpkin
with
a
small
amount
of
hops
malt
and
sweet
pumpkin
flavors
present
with
nutmeg
and
slight
cinnamony
flavors
toward
the
finish
also
a
surprisng
amount
of
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
healthy
dose
of
carbonation
a
solid
pumpkins
ale
but
there
are
others
i
will
return
to
before
this
one
big
blast
of
sweetness
right
up
front
pumpkin
rushed
in
with
all
of
its
accompanying
spices
allspice
is
particularly
strong
dry
finish
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
good
for
the
style
but
in
the
beer
world
as
a
whole
certainly
not
something
i
will
be
coming
back
to
it
is
worth
a
try
but
a
liking
for
this
beer
is
definitely
dependent
on
personal
taste
12
ounce
bottle
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
mostly
spice
presence
but
nothing
too
complex
or
interesting
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
so
far
i
found
dfh
to
be
mediocre
compared
to
this
very
enjoyable
and
a
great
treat
on
a
nice
october
night
like
tonight
a
perfect
orange
light
yellow
color
small
frothy
head
with
a
medium
carbonated
body
smells
of
light
nutmeg
medium
pumpkin
and
medium
cinnamon
spicy
on
the
tongue
mild
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
little
bit
of
bitterness
little
bit
of
a
weird
soap
like
flavor
mixed
with
the
bitterness
overall
a
nice
balance
of
all
flavors
very
smooth
clean
finish
pours
out
an
orangey
amber
with
a
full
white
head
malts
are
large
and
sweet
with
great
pumpkin
flavor
coming
through
hops
are
actually
there
and
do
a
great
job
of
adding
contrast
to
the
pumpkin
this
is
perhaps
the
most
hopped
pumpkin
brew
that
i
have
tried
and
i
do
not
think
that
it
hurts
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
helps
make
the
beer
more
drinkable
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
looks
a
lot
like
their
ipa
smells
strongly
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
along
with
the
obvious
pumpkin
reminds
me
of
refrigerated
leftover
pumpkin
pie
taste
wise
the
purre
of
pumkin
really
stands
out
its
almost
as
if
you
can
chew
on
the
stringiness
of
it
the
spicing
enhances
the
whole
experience
of
it
it
really
gets
better
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
carbonation
is
not
unbearable
perfect
to
drink
on
this
cool
maine
october
evening
despite
this
one
critique
this
may
be
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
its
pumpkincolored
slightly
toasted
orange
in
color
with
a
slick
layer
of
foamy
white
head
fizzy
aromas
are
wonderful
not
100
pumpkin
more
like
mamas
pumpkin
pie
pumpkin
nutmeg
cinnamon
this
theme
is
wonderfully
carried
over
to
the
flavor
lots
of
pumpkin
flavor
here
spiced
up
for
good
measure
slightly
bitter
on
the
tail
end
and
this
mixes
nicely
with
the
spicy
pumpkin
notes
not
at
hefty
as
id
expected
but
very
very
drinkable
a
great
fall
beer
and
one
ill
seek
out
again
i
am
actually
enjoying
this
ale
at
the
time
i
am
writing
this
review
i
have
been
drinking
quite
a
bit
of
pumpkin
ale
this
season
and
along
with
the
others
ive
had
this
one
has
been
quite
a
pleasure
overall
the
nose
is
a
bit
more
subtle
than
most
of
the
other
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
recently
but
not
too
distant
the
overall
taste
on
this
ale
has
been
somewhat
subdued
but
nice
nonetheless
there
tends
to
be
a
slightly
more
bitter
finish
along
with
an
apparent
malt
flavor
overall
this
is
a
nice
ale
that
i
would
recommend
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
at
some
point
d
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
mostly
due
to
the
topnotch
blending
of
the
spices
malts
and
hops
there
is
no
single
dominant
flavor
that
ruins
the
balance
of
this
beer
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
at
any
time
of
year
this
is
probably
my
second
favority
pumpkin
but
it
is
not
close
to
the
dfh
that
i
tried
earlier
it
pours
a
hazy
dull
copper
color
with
a
slight
head
of
mostly
bubbles
the
nose
is
one
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
a
little
pumpkin
but
very
little
malt
and
almost
no
hops
aroma
this
tasted
like
a
storebought
pumpkin
pie
as
opposed
to
a
freshbake
one
the
maltiness
spices
and
pumpkin
were
ther
but
i
tasted
no
balancing
hops
aroma
the
flavor
is
good
and
i
would
not
refuse
a
second
but
i
waited
a
couple
nights
to
finish
the
second
one
as
opposed
to
the
dfh
which
i
finished
that
night
drinkability
some
people
get
turned
off
by
fruit
or
spice
beers
but
this
one
i
think
i
could
have
repeatedly
i
like
that
this
doesnt
overstep
its
bounds
at
any
time
in
any
place
that
makes
its
drinkability
great
in
my
book
consistently
one
of
my
favorite
fall
seasonals
hazy
copper
color
with
a
loose
foam
of
white
on
top
reducing
to
slick
and
bubbles
the
smell
was
of
slight
autumn
spices
like
cinnemon
and
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
flavor
just
a
slight
hint
of
toasty
malts
and
a
crisp
nose
the
flavor
was
very
nice
i
thought
the
front
end
was
very
much
taken
with
the
pumkin
flavors
but
it
morphed
well
into
a
crisp
autumn
pale
ale
replete
with
a
hop
twang
and
a
toasty
biscuity
malt
backing
the
spices
come
back
towards
the
finish
but
they
are
not
overly
dominating
the
mouthfeel
is
sufficiantly
crisp
and
full
bodied
at
the
same
time
a
very
good
choice
for
a
beer
as
the
temperature
starts
to
dip
and
the
seasons
change
before
your
eyes
i
knew
summer
was
over
when
i
spotted
this
on
the
shelf
pours
a
dark
gold
with
a
dense
white
head
the
smell
is
inviting
with
pumpkin
pie
spices
strong
on
the
nutmeg
im
a
fan
of
hops
but
the
taste
somewhat
contrasts
what
the
beer
is
all
about
the
spice
has
a
hard
time
coming
through
the
taste
of
the
hops
overall
a
average
to
good
taste
and
a
decent
drinking
beer
but
i
dont
get
the
sensation
of
drinking
pumpkin
pie
this
is
an
orangy
amber
ale
with
a
lacey
off
white
head
there
is
a
good
dose
of
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
you
get
a
sweet
pumpkiny
flavor
at
first
followed
quickly
by
a
nutmeg
predominate
spice
taste
but
unfortunetly
the
finish
has
a
astringent
chemical
taste
the
just
lies
in
the
back
of
your
throat
and
distracts
from
the
original
good
pumpkin
start
the
first
pour
from
a
fresh
keg
first
4
pours
when
all
was
said
and
done
at
the
lazy
boy
saloon
i
am
not
generally
a
big
fan
of
the
pumpkins
but
a
brewer
of
this
quality
certainly
deserved
a
shot
and
they
score
with
this
one
a
nice
color
nothing
too
special
had
a
nice
white
head
that
laced
well
you
can
smell
the
pumpkin
but
it
does
not
overwhelm
the
smell
follows
directly
to
the
taste
that
is
to
say
there
are
no
surprises
it
tastes
like
it
smells
there
is
certainly
pumpkin
and
perhaps
some
spices
but
the
hops
and
malts
let
you
know
that
you
were
drinking
beer
had
decent
carbonation
i
was
surprised
when
i
had
a
second
3rd
4th
so
the
drinkability
was
obviously
good
a
fine
effort
from
a
fine
brewer
along
with
post
road
pumpkin
ale
this
was
the
best
of
the
flight
easy
drinking
great
for
a
cool
fall
night
all
in
all
a
solid
version
of
the
style
nothing
spectacular
but
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
into
this
style
i
was
hoping
for
and
expecting
a
bit
more
from
this
one
not
bad
overall
but
missing
something
it
pours
a
bright
yet
slightly
couded
orange
colour
with
a
sticky
but
tiny
head
the
smell
is
nice
if
muted
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
pinecone
and
dirt
dominate
a
well
rounded
smell
the
flavour
is
simply
average
its
not
as
bold
as
the
smell
though
it
mixes
in
the
same
things
and
has
a
touch
of
a
metallic
base
to
it
setting
the
overall
flavour
off
a
bit
all
around
that
said
the
cinnamon
finish
is
nice
id
knock
the
carbonation
down
a
touch
as
well
as
it
tends
to
take
away
from
the
flavour
here
again
not
bad
but
needs
some
tweaking
the
taste
is
no
different
very
pleasing
to
the
palate
as
all
parts
are
hit
pumpkin
for
the
front
hops
for
the
back
in
equal
amounts
a
very
well
balanced
combination
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
which
is
appropriate
for
an
ale
of
this
type
drinkability
is
very
good
an
excellent
autumn
beverage
as
intended
smuttynose
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
regional
breweries
i
find
their
beer
to
be
above
the
average
in
quality
across
all
their
products
i
was
excited
to
see
the
pumpkin
ale
available
in
stores
and
bought
a
6
to
drink
and
rate
the
beer
poured
a
mildly
hazy
pumpkin
orangecopper
it
had
a
slight
had
and
just
a
touch
of
lace
the
nose
is
mildly
pumpkin
but
more
on
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
it
really
does
remind
one
of
pumpkin
pie
as
with
many
pumpkins
the
spice
is
in
the
forefront
of
the
beer
pumpkin
does
come
through
midway
through
the
drink
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
the
fruit
spice
and
malt
great
medium
mouth
feel
and
crispness
lend
to
a
high
drinkability
i
cant
usually
drink
many
pumpkin
ales
but
this
one
is
different
enough
to
warrant
1
or
2
more
bender
factor
warming
after
the
first
one
who
needs
turkey
dinner
when
one
can
show
up
to
the
inlaws
toting
along
4
sixers
your
mother
in
law
will
appreciate
you
saving
her
time
washing
dishes
as
all
you
need
is
a
bowl
to
drink
out
of
the
beer
pours
a
nice
orangedark
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
mild
pumpkin
scent
that
boasts
of
some
ginger
and
cinnamon
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
a
smooth
tasting
brew
with
a
good
pumpkin
punch
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
the
ginger
sticks
out
as
well
as
some
hops
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
pumpkin
ale
if
there
is
such
a
thing
it
is
smooth
drinking
and
good
tasting
i
trust
my
palate
and
i
am
certain
this
is
brewed
with
some
if
not
massive
amounts
of
ginger
the
earthy
pumpkin
is
in
the
background
as
are
some
of
the
traditional
spices
like
nutmeg
but
the
dominant
taste
here
is
ginger
it
is
aggressive
up
front
like
homebrewed
ginger
ale
then
is
rounded
out
by
a
biscuity
maltiness
and
ever
so
delicate
hops
characteristics
then
on
the
aftertaste
the
ginger
comes
back
and
the
end
result
is
actually
quite
refreshing
this
may
be
one
of
the
few
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
in
one
sitting
its
a
hazy
light
pumpkinorange
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
spicy
like
nutmegpumpkin
the
aroma
of
a
pumpkin
pie
in
the
oven
i
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
somewhat
thick
and
syrupy
without
being
overpowering
but
the
flavor
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
pumpkin
flavor
was
lost
in
a
hop
bitterness
that
didnt
match
the
aroma
at
all
with
a
very
dry
finish
the
pumpkin
would
reappear
in
the
aftertaste
but
i
found
little
reason
to
have
another
it
is
a
dark
orange
in
color
the
aromas
are
of
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
almost
like
a
freshly
baked
pumpkin
pie
the
malty
body
was
complemented
well
with
a
spiced
finish
i
thibnk
it
is
hard
to
pull
off
a
great
pumpkin
ale
but
this
beer
does
a
pretty
good
job
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
at
thanksgiving
dinner
had
a
excellent
appearance
huge
thick
white
head
with
alot
of
lacing
present
the
color
is
cloudy
orange
tons
of
sediment
floating
around
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
no
carbonated
bite
to
it
it
has
an
immitation
like
pumpkin
taste
needs
more
maltcarboantionand
cinnamon
it
has
a
piney
hop
taste
that
shouldnt
be
there
has
a
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
am
not
impressed
with
smuttynoses
attempt
at
a
pumpkin
ale
take
a
few
hints
from
post
road
the
label
says
its
made
with
pumpkin
puree
and
spices
it
has
more
of
a
squash
taste
than
pumpkin
and
is
slightly
spiced
overall
average
taste
initially
creamy
i
can
actually
taste
the
pumpkin
in
this
one
unlike
so
many
others
of
this
style
the
taste
is
not
entirely
dominated
by
the
spices
noted
in
the
aroma
description
although
theyre
certainly
present
nicely
dry
finish
with
a
slight
yeastiness
makes
for
a
highly
drinkable
brew
especially
for
this
style
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
medium
bodied
and
slow
rising
carbination
bubbles
were
seen
very
drinkable
for
a
pumpkin
ale
one
of
the
best
versions
of
a
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
since
it
was
not
over
the
top
but
it
had
a
great
flavor
from
start
to
finish
you
didnt
get
tired
of
big
thanks
to
tha
rabidawg
for
this
un
orangeamber
in
color
with
a
thin
lace
spicy
aroma
lots
of
ginger
and
cloves
much
of
the
same
in
the
taste
very
good
mix
of
spices
theyre
obvious
but
not
overpowering
very
sweet
like
pumpkin
pie
but
not
so
sweet
that
it
makes
in
undrinkable
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
i
have
experienced
there
is
a
slightly
orange
color
to
the
beer
also
just
a
but
hazy
the
nose
is
fairly
reminiscent
of
a
pumpkin
pie
the
taste
has
a
pretty
good
ipa
type
beer
in
the
background
but
the
spices
are
just
a
bit
overdone
cut
back
on
them
a
hair
and
they
will
have
a
fine
pumpkin
beer
still
it
is
pretty
good
definitely
an
acquired
taste
had
this
on
tap
at
the
drafting
room
in
spring
housepoured
a
medium
orangegold
color
with
a
light
but
sticky
headaroma
was
strong
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
just
like
opening
a
jar
of
cinnamon
the
taste
was
not
so
over
the
top
a
more
subtle
pumpkin
flavor
with
the
spices
also
being
more
subdued
a
light
hop
bitternes
lingers
pretty
well
i
think
a
real
nice
pumpkin
offering
here
other
probably
the
best
foodbeer
pairing
of
the
night
we
had
a
pumpkin
and
ginger
soup
that
was
very
creamy
the
beer
managed
to
both
complement
and
contrast
the
food
at
the
same
time
the
spices
of
both
complemented
but
the
hops
of
the
beer
cleansed
the
palate
and
provided
great
contrast
so
that
you
didnt
get
bogged
down
by
all
that
creamy
goodness
this
beer
was
a
decentenough
amber
colour
with
a
small
head
the
aromas
were
pumkin
spices
malts
and
hops
the
taste
was
very
good
a
nice
mix
of
ale
base
pumpkin
pie
taste
and
spices
this
was
in
between
the
extremely
punkiny
dfh
offering
and
bbws
pretty
nonpumpkiny
one
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
and
the
drinkability
was
on
as
well
drinkability
okay
but
i
prefer
post
road
or
dfh
i
may
have
gotten
a
rotten
pumpkin
in
mine
or
soomething
i
thought
it
was
way
too
minty
tasteing
for
me
sure
it
smelled
great
looked
great
and
felt
pretty
good
in
the
mouth
but
other
than
that
it
was
very
disappointing
it
had
a
very
strange
taste
that
left
a
horrible
aftertaste
it
had
good
body
to
it
but
the
taste
was
just
too
funky
i
thought
it
was
rather
rich
in
the
funky
taste
and
i
couldnt
finish
it
i
really
liked
this
one
this
beer
poured
out
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
a
thinnish
and
short
lasting
head
theres
a
unique
smell
here

i
cant
detect
a
distinctive
pumpkin
aroma
but
it
is
vegetal
along
with
a
pleasing
spiciness
with
sweet
lemon
grass
the
taste
is
earthy
and
hearty
a
spicy
and
light
malt
body
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
this
beer
isnt
oily
or
buttery
but
finishes
clean
and
dry
refreshing
and
flavorful
not
overdone
a
quality
seasonal
ale
clear
orange
color
just
a
little
haze
to
it
small
head
that
fades
quickly
spice
dominates
the
smell
allspice
etc
get
the
pumpkin
to
step
up
in
the
taste
with
the
spices
and
a
little
green
hop
bite
in
it
bitter
bite
that
fades
a
little
creamy
very
drinkable
pours
a
darkorange
color
with
serious
cloudiness
and
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
fanastic
its
similar
to
a
fresh
pumpkin
bread
unlike
a
lot
of
other
pumpkin
beers
this
one
doenst
seem
to
rely
on
pumpkinpie
spices
to
acquire
its
flavor
instead
its
a
doughy
malty
vegtablepumpkin
taste
slightly
sweet
mildly
spiced
outstanding
this
is
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
pumpkin
beer
it
pours
a
hazy
goldish
amber
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
and
some
trails
and
webs
of
sticky
lace
the
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
pie
with
beer
a
sweet
biscuity
malty
mixes
well
with
mellow
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
vanilla
a
mild
lemony
citrus
offers
a
nice
balance
to
the
malt
and
spices
a
faint
flavor
reminiscent
of
eggnog
and
rum
come
to
mind
it
really
goes
down
easy
and
was
gone
before
i
had
the
chance
to
appropriately
conclude
this
review
yum
this
pumpkin
beer
poured
a
hazy
honey
gold
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
a
bit
the
smell
was
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
nutmeg
allspice
cinnamon
pumpkin
malt
and
hops
the
taste
was
of
pumpkin
and
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
malt
some
oak
and
hops
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
the
flavors
were
nicely
balanced
and
the
spices
did
not
overpower
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
hint
of
sharpness
up
front
medium
body
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
feel
the
spices
lingered
on
the
palate
this
was
a
good
pumpkin
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
and
very
easy
to
drink
all
in
all
an
excellent
beer
would
love
to
have
this
for
a
halloween
weekend
session
this
is
a
really
solid
ale
and
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
one
i
could
drink
with
no
problem
i
love
this
beer
thisll
definitely
make
an
appearance
at
thanksgiving
dinner
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
with
a
good
size
white
head
that
mostly
diminishes
leaving
sheets
of
lace
very
fine
tiny
bubbled
carbonation
in
the
body
aroma
is
of
freshly
baked
pumpkin
pie
mostly
from
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spices
backed
with
a
good
bit
of
hops
flavor
is
again
dominated
with
the
cinnamon
some
sweetness
comes
through
in
the
middle
and
the
end
is
a
mix
with
the
spices
and
some
hoppy
bitterness
in
there
as
well
mediumfull
bodied
fairly
lively
carbonation
a
very
good
balance
between
the
squash
and
malt
sweetness
the
spices
and
a
good
level
of
hoppiness
this
beer
pours
nicely
a
head
that
settles
fast
over
a
nice
orange
amber
it
smells
strongly
of
spices
but
not
so
much
of
hops
at
first
the
pumpkin
is
overshadowed
by
other
spices
mainly
nutmeg
but
the
aftertaste
is
oh
so
pleasant
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
a
exceptional
pumpkin
brew
that
i
will
get
my
share
of
this
autumn
smuttynose
pumpkin
ale
is
a
slightly
hazy
straw
colored
brew
with
a
thick
white
head
that
dissolves
to
a
thick
collar
around
the
beer
the
aroma
is
mainly
a
spicy
combination
of
cinnamon
allspice
and
nutmeg
i
think
i
can
detect
a
little
bit
of
toasted
malt
in
there
as
well
each
sip
of
this
medium
bodied
beer
is
smooth
and
delicious
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
dominate
the
flavor
but
do
not
overpower
the
taste
buds
it
finishes
slightly
malty
which
seems
to
hold
all
the
flavors
together
a
spicy
taste
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
love
the
label
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
an
orangey
beige
head
that
drops
right
away
nose
is
sweet
and
spicy
but
not
overly
spiced
like
some
other
pumpkins
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
not
overly
pumpinized
not
overly
spiced
with
nutmeg
not
overly
hoppy
very
nice
balance
of
all
three
but
lowest
on
hops
tingly
mouthfeel
and
a
sweet
pumpkin
finish
followed
by
a
hop
bitter
aftertaste
very
good
a
very
simple
label
merely
adds
to
the
appeal
of
this
beer
a
fuzzy
orange
color
with
just
a
slight
white
lacey
head
taste
is
a
cornacopia
of
nutmeg
pumpkin
and
assorted
spices
keeps
its
bold
ale
body
ensuring
a
delightful
tasting
beverage
worthy
of
smuttynose
definitely
great
for
the
early
days
of
fall
when
the
weather
is
still
warm
and
youre
anticipating
the
leaves
changing
color
a
bit
too
light
to
satisfy
my
tastes
for
the
colder
days
when
the
leaves
rattle
around
the
the
street
but
certainly
great
for
september
pours
with
an
off
white
head
settling
onto
amberorange
liquid
gently
carbonated
nose
is
a
whiff
of
malt
pushed
aside
by
fresh
fruity
pumpkin
pie
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
etc
mingled
with
a
backbone
of
hoppy
aromas
taste
is
slightly
astringent
quite
hoppy
with
more
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
some
degree
of
malty
sweetness
finished
a
tad
dry
and
thin
but
refreshing
and
tasty
nonetheless
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
tasted
and
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style

this

the
first
season
i
have
seen
this
locally
nh
but
their
site
says
available
each
fall
win
meh
not
great
not
terrible
i
wish
i
had
positive
things
to
say
about
any
pumpkin
ale
overall
this
is
another
good
pumpkin
beer
good
balance
between
malt
pumpkin
spices
sweetness
and
hops
id
certainly
get
it
again
o
punkn
is
not
a
horrible
beer
but
just
doesnt
measure
up
as
a
pumpkin
ale
boring
good
stuff
this
punkn
beer
its
long
trail
of
sweetness
and
spice
are
never
intent
on
relinquishing
the
palate
as
the
ale
has
no
real
transcendence
toward
finish
lingering
on
in
dessertlike
finish
warm
with
both
spice
and
alcohol
neither
hinder
the
ales
supreme
drinkability
the
lowpoint
for
this
beer
is
its
very
diluted
pumpkin
flavor
youre
left
with
more
of
a
sugary
soft
drink
like
taste
its
not
unpleasant
per
se
but
really
doesnt
deliver
much
of
a
wow
factor
pours
lightcopper
but
doesnt
give
off
too
much
aroma
the
pumpkin
spice
uinta
uses
isnt
sweet
like
the
usual
pumpkin
beers
that
use
the
pumpkin
pie
spice
it
is
a
balanced
beer
though
however
i
would
have
expected
much
more
out
of
a
uinta
brew
probably
not
worth
another
try
could
not
finish
a
glass
rich
pumpkin
pie
spices
thick
creamy
head
o
looks
like
i
like
this
better
than
most
reviewers
not
the
greatest
pumpkin
beer
but
considering
the
lowish
abv
good
flavor
and
feel
id
have
it
again
overall
it
is
just
an
ok
beer
i
should
point
out
that
i
enjoy
a
good
pumpkin
ale
in
the
fall
and
look
forward
to
sampling
new
ones
this
is
far
from
the
worst
pumpkin
ive
had
pours
a
deep
pumpkin
color
the
color
actual
looks
more
like
real
pumpkin
was
used
than
most
other
pumkin
beers
aroma
is
light
pumpkin
whipped
cream
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
taste
is
very
very
light
and
actually
pleasant
it
is
a
little
too
light
and
some
of
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
lost
but
it
is
a
nice
change
from
the
overspiced
other
seasonal
ales
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
not
bitter
just
overall
a
very
light
punkn
ale
similar
to
dfh
punkin
but
not
as
balanced
heavier
on
the
spice
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
feel
like
the
pumpkin
is
very
natural
and
not
overdone
but
i
also
feel
like
its
not
very
polished
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
otherwise
its
merely
an
ok
quaff
o
ho
hum
good
pumpkin
but
not
great
poured
from
a
12oz
can
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
aggressive
pour
yielded
a
good
inch
high
thick
head
clear
orangegold
color
nice
looking
beer
aroma
is
pretty
weak
with
some
light
pumpkin
aroma
and
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
likewise
pretty
weak
with
a
slight
taste
of
pumpkin
pie
filling
and
a
bit
of
tartness
very
little
malty
sweetness
and
no
hoppiness
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
overall
not
the
greatest
verion
of
a
pumpkin
ale
out
there
probably
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
punkn
is
an
exceptionally
light
and
not
particularly
special
pumpkin
beer
it
does
seems
to
nail
the
style
as
it
delivers
a
gourd
or
yam
malt
starchy
and
dry
it
ends
with
a
bit
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
all
spice
i
dont
find
this
offensive
by
any
measure
just
not
bold
enough
to
expect
another
glance
there
are
much
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
pretty
nice
maybe
a
lower
abv
is
the
solution
for
so
many
shitty
pumpkin
brews
out
there
just
sayin
but
i
am
right
i
would
argue
that
punkn
is
a
less
well
rounded
version
of
dfhs
punkin
the
roastedcharred
pumpkin
note
is
a
bit
off
balanced
about
standard
for
a
pumpkin
beer
overall
i
was
pretty
interested
after
the
appearance
and
smell
but
the
taste
was
a
real
let
down
here
im
a
little
surprised
as
ive
had
much
better
offerings
from
uinta
this
truly
makes
me
think
of
something
that
may
have
been
a
better
pumkin
ale
that
was
watered
down
with
a
significant
amount
of
club
soda
much
like
i
believe
another
reviewer
said
i
cant
recommend
this
and
i
wont
try
it
again
there
are
much
better
pumkin
beers
out
there

not
uintas
best
showing
first
impression
is
that
this
is
a
little
flat
the
flavor
matches
the
nose
im
impressed
with
this
offering
of
a
season
of
pumpkin
brew
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
was
happy
to
see
an
impressive
head
with
distinct
lacing
that
lasted
throughout
my
entire
session
colour
was
pure
and
deep
essembling
whiskey
in
the
glass
nose
was
subdued
but
with
subtle
spice
and
lots
of
roasty
pumpkin
the
taste
is
surprisingly
dry
not
sweet
at
all
a
nice
twist
for
a
genre
a
bruise
that
are
often
overly
sweet
and
overly
spiced
this
one
is
all
pumpkin
with
a
more
subtle
spice
profile
than
many
competitors
its
a
bit
one
dimensional
slightly
flat
but
with
such
a
nice
head
and
with
such
a
reserved
interpretation
on
pumpkin
beer
this
is
one
to
try
again
and
a
beer
to
recommend
for
those
who
are
not
fans
of
the
overthetop
examples
of
this
style
im
a
little
disappointed
and
its
difficult
not
to
show
that
in
this
review
its
hoppy
with
a
smell
like
pumpkins
but
comes
off
like
an
amber
with
almost
zero
remarkable
qualities
hooray
nice
pour
dry
pumpkin
finish
could
be
spicier
overall

i
dont
quite
know
what
to
think
of
this
brew
i
think
id
lean
more
towards
the
hate
category
but
its
not
entirely
terrible
id
say
its
a
notch
above
shock
tops
offering
which
isnt
saying
much
the
taste
is
mawkish
in
every
sense
of
the
word
until
you
get
to
the
end
where
you
taste
fresh
pumpkin
pie
i
dont
think
the
first
part
is
worth
agonizing
through
just
for
a
pleasant
three
second
aftertaste
its
actually
giving
me
a
little
heartburn
too
ah
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again

good
beer
with
the
right
amount
of
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
as
well
as
a
nice
roasted
or
smokey
complement
from
the
roasted
pumpkins
overall
its
very
good
at
being
what
its
supposed
to
be
and
i
can
appreciate
that
however
i
will
admit
i
am
also
a
fan
of
the
bolder
pumpkin
ales
and
i
find
punkn
to
be
a
perfect
mixer
to
smooth
out
the
likes
of
pumking
weyerbacher
imperial
kentucky
pumpkin
barrel
etc
either
way
for
the
price
theres
nothing
to
complain
about
here
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
reminds
me
heavily
of
post
road
lots
of
flavor
i
like
that
theres
actual
pumpkin
in
here
and
not
just
a
spice
bomb
andi
really
like
the
restraint
uinta
exercised
its
one
of
the
few
pumpkin
beers
id
have
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
the
label
says
pumpkin
ale
but
i
think
this
should
be
renamed
as
a
spiced
fall
ale
drinking
this
makes
me
feel
like
i
should
be
outside
on
an
overcast
low
50
degree
day
among
wind
blown
leaves
the
color
is
a
rich
amber
with
slow
dissipating
head
white
head
mouthfeel
is
moderate
faint
notes
of
pumpkin
but
more
essence
of
general
spices
i
had
this
a
few
years
back
and
thought
it
was
pretty
weak
but
decided
to
pick
it
up
again
after
seeing
theyve
at
least
changed
the
recipe
a
little
bit
and
brought
it
to
a
5
abv
per
the
info
on
their
website
looks
the
part
of
a
pumpkin
orangyred
and
maybe
a
slight
haze
actually
poured
a
pretty
good
head
that
lasted
well
not
very
long
but
it
was
there
the
nose
smells
of
typical
pumpkiny
spices
like
cloves
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
tastes
about
the
same
but
this
one
does
have
a
very
slight
but
noticeable
pumpkin
flavor
to
it
i
find
a
lot
of
others
you
just
get
spice
and
some
unidentifiable
funkiness
to
it
which
i
presume
is
gourd
but
here
its
recognizable
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
is
it
tastes
like
the
smell
of
when
a
candle
starts
to
cook
the
lid
of
a
jack
o
lantern
the
mouthfeel
is
also
quite
nice
silky
and
a
little
tart
on
the
back
end
i
think
the
mouthfeel
puts
it
above
the
average
category
and
i
do
also
like
the
fact
that
you
can
taste
some
real
pumpkin
in
here
ive
been
trying
more
and
more
uinta
stuff
and
have
been
impressed
by
many
of
their
offerings
i
would
easily
pick
this
up
again
in
between
some
of
the
bigger
pumpkin
ales
pours
like
a
standard
pumpkin
ale
possibly
a
little
darker
the
aroma
and
flavor
carries
a
sort
of
vegetative
quality
probably
from
the
pumpkin
flesh
addition
along
with
a
mineralcarbonic
character
that
i
found
to
be
distracting
the
spice
addition
was
quite
restrained
and
leaned
toward
more
herbalbitter
instead
of
malty
and
sweet
o
great
beer
i
love
pumpkin
ales
and
this
is
one
of
best
ive
had
so
far
uinta
punkn
3
55
a
lot
of
pumpkin
and
spice
in
the
aroma
with
some
malt
sweetness
to
back
it
up
but
no
hop
presence
or
bitterness
at
all
the
flavor
starts
with
the
pumpkin
but
has
a
bit
stronger
of
a
malt
presence
with
bready
malt
character
coming
through
there
is
a
bit
of
a
bitterness
in
the
flavor
but
you
really
need
to
search
for
it
not
bad
but
a
touch
too
sweet
for
my
taste
o
if
you
like
the
style
i
recommend
it
its
a
very
good
beer
to
me
but
im
a
fan
of
the
style
especially
when
the
flavor
of
pumpkin
and
spices
are
well
represented
also
the
toasty
malty
notes
make
a
great
addition
o
i
love
pumpkin
ales
as
ive
graded
over
30
but
the
ketchup
aroma
and
flavor
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
good
mouthfeel
but
lacks
a
balanced
spice
flavor
and
the
beer
lack
some
malt
character
pumpkin
as
with
most
pumpkin
ales
does
not
come
through
well
kept
a
good
head
in
a
shaker
pint
and
was
fairly
clear
slightly
cloudy
cinnamon
flavor
is
a
clear
and
is
overall
a
solid
ale
it
lacks
a
balance
between
being
a
pumpkin
ale
and
being
a
great
ale
pretty
decent
pumpkin
beer
it
has
to
be
said
the
flavor
is
unmistakably
that
of
pumpkin
and
there
is
a
good
bit
of
cinnamon
and
spice
to
it
nothing
memorable
but
it
does
the
trick
draught
headkeeper
this
one
pours
a
clear
orange
tinged
amber
color
there
was
a
wisp
of
an
offwhite
head
on
it
lighter
but
nice
aroma
some
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
a
hint
of
pumpkin
the
taste
is
good
some
pumpkin
pie
spices
some
pumpkin
and
some
malt
sweetness
fairly
nice
the
flavor
has
some
green
hops
with
mild
herbal
flavor
and
gentle
malt
taste
upfront
which
leads
to
a
spiced
and
caramel
sweetness
in
the
middle
the
malt
gives
a
dry
nutty
toasted
grain
foundation
to
the
mild
alcohol
and
light
spice
in
the
semidry
finish
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
tasty
lower
abv
pumpkin
with
nice
subdued
spicing
nad
a
good
foundation
of
malt
i
would
drink
this
again
o
i
obviously
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
others
i
felt
it
was
a
great
fall
pumpkin
beer
the
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
are
present
but
dont
rule
the
beer
its
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
pleasant
aroma
i
will
look
for
this
one
again
punkn
is
on
par
with
long
trail
and
3rd
on
my
list
other
middle
of
the
pack
treats
include
ufo
tommyknocker
ichabod
and
southampton
stay
away
from
smuttynose
which
tastes
like
potpourri
i
am
not
a
fan
of
samuel
adams
or
blue
moon
either
if
you
like
hard
cider
woodchuck
has
a
nice
smooth
mild
pumpkin
flavor
maple
mistress
is
supposed
to
be
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
but
tastes
like
an
imperial
maple
ale
this
beer
pours
a
caramel
tan
color
theres
pumpkin
spice
on
the
aroma
with
a
heavy
handed
clove
and
allspice
it
tastes
slightly
bitter
with
a
touch
of
roast
the
clove
and
allspice
dominates
the
flavor
dry
finish
not
a
bad
sipper
it
is
what
it
is
i
actually
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
it
doesnt
claim
to
be
anything
its
not
its
a
sessionable
ale
with
pumpkin
added
descent
flavor
and
well
balanced
i
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
burnt
orange
color
body
with
a
thick
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
while
the
smell
is
faint
of
spices
the
taste
is
the
same
way
faintnof
spices
execpt
of
clove
i
dont
get
any
pumpkin
flavor
mouthfeel
is
flat
and
overall
not
that
good
i
went
with
an
aggro
pour
as
there
had
better
not
be
any
lees
to
get
stirred
up
the
result
was
two
thick
fingers
of
tawny
head
that
slowly
fell
like
an
aging
heavyweight
who
just
got
tagged
on
the
chin
by
an
up
and
coming
opponent
what
remained
was
soft
and
creamy
like
soft
serve
ice
cream
nose
was
maltier
than
the
other
two
offerings
this
evening
making
for
a
nice
change
of
pace
color
was
a
deepcopper
srm
17
22
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
this
one
struck
a
nice
balance
between
the
organic
pumpkin
the
organic
spices
and
the
barley
malt
giving
it
a
light
spiciness
but
not
overwhelming
the
malty
sweetness
that
acted
as
the
beers
backbone
i
get
it
i
am
an
american
and
we
like
things
that
are
overamped
but
this
was
a
striking
contrast
to
the
spice
rack
receptacles
from
earlier
in
the
evening
with
them
one
each
was
plenty
in
this
one
the
finish
was
pleasantly
semidry
and
not
harsh
in
terms
of
its
inherent
spiciness
i
would
not
want
a
full
day
of
it
but
at
least
i
felt
like
i
could
drink
more
than
just
one
i
may
lay
in
a
couplefew
more
for
the
upcoming
holidays
o
typically
when
i
think
about
pumpkin
beers
i
usually
lean
towards
thoughts
of
halloween
many
of
the
bottles
have
images
of
jack
o
lanterns
owls
headless
horsemen
and
other
ghoulish
figures
associated
with
halloween
this
beer
just
screams
harvest
more
than
anything
like
i
said
it
seems
traditional
in
a
way
even
the
bottle
art
is
plain
and
simple
try
this
if
you
get
a
chance
if
anything
it
is
very
different
it
is
like
a
whole
pumpkin
in
a
glass
overall
a
nice
and
light
alternative
to
pumpkin
beers
but
still
sweet
though
pours
a
deep
bronze
color
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
of
pumpkin
caramel
and
spice
in
the
taste
mostly
malt
and
pumpkin
a
bit
more
hop
influence
than
many
examples
of
the
style
with
a
hopspice
bite
nutmeg
all
spice
and
coriander
dial
in
the
holiday
spices
but
faint
which
makes
for
an
easier
drinking
beverage
nice
malt
and
pumpkin
flavor
overall
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
there
is
nothing
really
special
going
on
here
overall
the
beer
would
be
much
more
enjoyable
without
the
canned
vegetable
aspect
as
this
beer
distracts
the
senses
and
seems
out
of
place
okay
but
not
a
favorite
the
taste
had
some
biscuit
character
with
squash
or
yamlike
notes
but
nothing
that
jumped
out
at
me
kind
of
bland
actually
o
a
bit
of
a
bland
pumpkin
beer
not
enough
spice
or
malt
sweetness
to
give
it
an
edge
or
whats
needed
in
the
flavor
department
fairly
expected
for
a
4
brew
given
that
its
a
nice
easy
drinker
thats
good
for
the
transition
to
colder
weather
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
nothing
special
but
not
bad
and
has
decent
flavor
and
body
considering
the
abv
sorry
anna
poured
into
an
oversized

was
a

pumpkin

better
than
i
was
expecting
from
the

and
light
enough
on

to
drink
more
than
a
couple
if
needed
nice
seeing
it
in
a
6pack
the
beer
store
had
just
received
this
a
few
days
ago
im
not
much
for
fruity
on
tap
at
the
mellow
in
greensboro
poured
a
light
orange
shade
for
a
pumpkin
ale
with
a
fizzy
white
head
atop
light
sweet
pie
spice
in
the
nose
and
that
was
really
alllight
and
fizzy
in
the
mouth
with
more
spice
rather
than
pumpkin
flavors
iam
gonna
try
the
imperial
pumpkin
that
uinta
makesthis
gets
a
failing
grade
in
my
opinion
but
if
youre
looking
to
have
one
or
two
this
isnt
it
too
weak
think
and
certainly
not
enough
pumpkin
not
one
im
likely
to
get
again
heres
a
new
category
pumpkin
mild
interesting
for
the
high
drinkability
and
flavor
in
a
lowalcohol
beer
nice

color
in

a

flavor
and
more
of
a
cooked
pumpkin
less
of
the
spices
fortunately
to
my
taste
slight
tartness
like
a
saison
this
might
be
good
with
some
belgian
yeast
however
its
a
rather
light
plain
amber
beer
with
some
murky
but
appealing
squash
flavors
fragrant
nose
of
unidentified
fruit
a
touch
of
earth
and
mushrooms

this

gulp
a

notes
not
extraordinary
but
it
makes
for
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
that
i
would
not
mind
repeating
o
average
pumpkin
beer
i
am
used
the
over
powering
spice
and
pumpkin
flavors
this
seemed
a
little
watered
down
maybe
a
nice
beer
for
a
person
justing
getting
into
pumpkin
beers
its
a
one
and
done
for
me
well
as
soon
as
i
finished
this
six
pack
the
store
clerk
swore
up
and
down
about
this
beer
and
got
me
conclusion
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
beer
i
enjoyed
the
extra
helping
of
bitterness
and
especially
the
aftertaste
the
head
was
quite
good
as
well
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
amberish
orange
color
the
head
fizzles
away
to
just
a
white
film
over
top
of
the
beer
no
laceing
here
really
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
very
minimal
i
was
strut
leif
to
get
much
of
any
aroma
at
all
actually
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
thought
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
spice
from
start
to
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
drinkable
decent
carbonation
and
body
overall
this
brew
was
pretty
good
but
not
the
best
in
its
style
m
more
carbonated
than
it
appears
looks
flat
but
isnt
tastes
very
diluted
in
general
like
an
american
standard
macro
with
some
added
flavor
not
that
great
wont
have
it
again
part
one
of
two
of
my
utahn
pumpkin
beer
backtoback
minifete
this
one
pours
a
clear
tawnycopper
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
nutmeg
cinnamon
brown
sugar
very
light
cocoa
mandarin
orange
syrup
and
light
rye
crust
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
buttery
toffee
and
toasted
pumpkin
seeds
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nearly
creamy
feel
overall
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
one
that
manages
to
balance
nicely
between
spice
and
pumpkin
now
on
to
the
oakaged
cousin
i
mentioned
that
this
was
a
session
beer
i
would
buy
a
case
of
this
for
my
pumpkin
beer
for
the
season
nothing
crazy
certainly
not
anything
imperial
and
just
complex
enough
that
i
am
looking
to
get
some
more
already
great
example
of
the
style
and
this
really
melds
pumpkin
pie
with
beer
well
you
can
pick
out
all
the
elements
in
this
brew
overall
another
runofthemill
pumpkin
ale
nothing
special
going
on
here
but
at
least
its
got
some
solid
presentation
the
real
pumpkin
on
the
nose
is
a
nice
added
touch
and
its
definitely
a
drinkable
fall
beer
overall
being
the
first
punkn
beer
ive
tried
its
pretty
good
i
could
drink
more
but
i
think
for
this
style
1
and
done
is
probably
the
way
to
go
o
a
pumpkin
ale
that
smells
good
but
is
overall
just
too
bland
overall
this
probably
isnt
in
my
top
3
for
the
style
but
if
you
want
a
pumpkin
ale
that
wont
get
you
bombed
this
is
a
real
winner
o
an
okay
pumpkin
beer
but
theres
better
to
be
had
the
body
is
good
but
the
taste
just
doesnt
hold
up
i
do
like
the
newly
designed
label
though
similar
to
the
old
one
but
with
a
bit
more
pizzazz
o
nice
to
see
a
new
pumpkin
ale
in
the
southland
however
i
think
the
4
hinders
it
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
nose
overall
an
easy
drinking
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
many
that
were
disappointing
but
i
think
this
one
is
quite
underrated
any
session
strength
ale
that
is
not
boring
is
usually
a
winner
in
my
opinion
i
bought
this
6pack
for
my
wife
however
i
might
end
up
drinking
most
of
it
myself
from
the
start
the
pour
is
standard
into
a
sam
adams
glassim
from
boston
what
can
i
say
with
an
orange
glow
and
a
good
lasting
head
if
poured
right
proper
lacing
covers
the
glass
as
you
drink
the
smell
is
very
authentic
pumpkin
the
same
as
when
you
cut
open
one
to
carve
and
thats
the
best
your
going
to
get
with
my
stuffy
nose
taste
is
very
different
that
you
might
expect
i
did
not
like
this
the
first
few
mouthfuls
but
after
drinking
the
hole
thing
its
a
very
real
maybe
closest
to
real
pumpkin
without
many
spices
added
as
any
pumpkin
beer
this
season
the
taste
is
smooth
nothing
sticks
out
to
much
besides
the
real
pumpkin
flavor
i
would
suggest
folks
buy
this
beer
and
drink
it
with
the
understanding
that
it
is
going
to
be
different
than
most
but
in
its
own
style
it
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
would
i
buy
again
yes
but
i
would
not
mix
this
with
the
other
pumpkin
beers
seeing
this
one
is
very
different
not
your
typical
review
yes
but
im
not
your
typical
person
bender
factor
at
4
abv
who
they
hey
brews
a
4
brew
these
days
thats
a
no
go
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
anyways
mo
very
crisp
and
balanced
pumpkin
ale
with
good
flavoring
the
beer
isnt
overpowering
good
carbonation
and
really
good
transition
of
the
seasons
very
easy
drinking
as
there
are
no
flaws
and
almost
no
alcohol
part
of
mixed
six
pack
made
up
by
my
wife
a
few
weeks
back
when
she
wanted
to
try
some
pumpkin
beers
pours
a
clear
medium
orange
color
with
a
whisper
of
light
tan
head
pretty
weak
aromas
subtly
reminiscent
of
pumpkin
pie
fairly
light
bodied
with
more
pronounced
pumpkin
pie
flavors
cinnamon
clove
and
brown
sugar
somewhat
lacking
overall
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
pumpkin
ale
and
there
are
many
others
i
prefer
not
really
a
bad
beer
but
i
have
no
desire
to
drink
another
it
would
go
well
with
a
turkey
sandwich
with
cranberry
and
stuffing
over
priced
at
12
a
sixer
in
new
york
state
flat
tasting
with
only
a
very
vague
hint
of
pumpkin
spice
i
was
expecting
a
strong
tasting
pumpkin
flavor
given
the
name
and
its
halloween
oriented
sleek
blackandorange
packaging
very
light
tasting
this
is
a
decent
afternoon
beer
only
if
you
can
get
it
for
less
than
10
a
six
which
you
probably
cant
so
its
something
to
avoid
in
general
youd
be
much
better
off
with
any
popular
seasonal
magic
hat
saranac
or
sierra
nevada
thumbs
down
overall
the
body
of
this
beer
is
medium
light
with
a
medium
finish
the
beer
is
okay
it
has
a
funky
pumpkin
flavor
to
it
which
takes
a
minute
to
get
used
to
followed
by
a
weird
aftertaste
pours
light
copper
win
a
thin
off
white
head
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
a
bit
if
lacing
smell
is
really
plain
hint
of
spice
and
very
mild
pumpkin
a
bit
squashy
and
really
light
cinnamon
a
bit
vegetal
feel
is
light
and
undercarbonated
quite
plain
cool
label
and
some
nice
lacing
but
thats
about
all
i
can
say
in
favor
of
this
beer
pretty
bare
bones
not
overall
very
impressive
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
that
lingers
on
without
improvement
d
this
is
an
ok
take
on
the
style
but
not
something
ill
be
revisiting
soon
they
might
need
to
rethink
this
concoction
not
the
worst
hardly
up
with
the
best
its
drinkablity
is
ok
but
the
the
pumpkin
is
almost
an
overkill
and
the
finish
is
just
dumped
with
spices
and
with
not
enough
other
flavors
it
just
isnt
doing
the
job
for
this
fall
brew
this
was
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
compared
to
others
ive
had
which
tasted
like
cinnamon
soda
i
gave
this
beer
nearly
pure
2s
the
mark
of
not
impressed
the
lone
3
average
goes
to
drinkability
because
this
beer
would
be
drinkable
if
i
respected
myself
all
that
much
less
i
have
been
searching
for
the
perfect
pumpkin
ale
for
over
15
years
this
one
comes
the
closest
so
far
the
deep
orange
color
and
burnt
pumpkin
aroma
blew
me
away
taste
is
right
on
with
very
little
spice
sweetness
or
hops
its
all
toasted
pumpkin
the
reality
is
that
pumpkin
has
a
very
mild
flavor
and
this
is
as
close
as
it
gets
other
pumpkin
ales
seem
to
try
to
achieve
a
pumpkin
pie
flavor
in
a
beer
by
adding
to
much
spices
to
me
this
ale
strives
to
complement
pumpkin
pie
instead
of
mimicry
even
15
minutes
later
i
can
still
taste
the
burnt
pumpkin
with
the
low
abv
i
could
definitely
drink
a
six
pack
in
one
session
ill
be
looking
forward
to
punkn
ale
returning
next
year
there
are
so
many
good
pumpkin
ales
southern
tier
pumking
dogfish
head
punkin
that
its
hard
to
rate
this
any
better
than
mediocre
the
smell
is
truly
great
though
if
they
could
get
the
taste
to
standup
to
the
smell
this
would
be
a
truly
great
beer
drinkability
good
enough
prob
take
in
two
then
switch
over
to
a
90minute
ipa
dont
let
the
rating
on
this
one
sway
you
its
a
good
one
drinkability
perhaps
because
its
not
quite
the
season
yet
for
fall
beers
that
could
account
for
my
review
but
overall
its
a
simple
pumpkin
beer
you
could
easily
down
a
few
without
registering
the
fact
you
had
a
pumpkin
beer
with
the
exception
that
they
did
a
good
job
on
the
spices
not
bad
but
nothing
to
search
out
for
this
is
actually
a
good
pumpkin
beer
the
mix
of
spices
was
well
done
such
that
they
are
not
too
overpowering
despite
being
the
dominant
note
in
the
beer
but
if
you
dont
like
pumpkin
pie
spice
in
your
beer
then
i
would
stay
away
from
this
beer
as
it
is
a
bit
onedimensional
seeing
as
this
six
pack
cost
me
2
99
before
good
ol
tax
not
bad
i
do
prefer
it
to
some
macro
obviously
sessionable
because
of
the
alcohol
and
not
unpleasant
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
orangebrown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
fresh
pumpkin
pie
taste
like
it
smells
pumpkin
and
spices
finishing
a
tad
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
d
a
bland
and
unexciting
experience
that
quickly
grows
tiresome
rivals
in
mediocrity
and
not
worthy
six
pack
and
hardly
worth
a
single
purchase
pass
on
this
one
thanks
douglas88
for
the
opportunity
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
several
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
and
the
carbonation
feels
fizzy
d
nothing
special
about
this
pumpkin
ale
and
there
are
many
others
that
id
choose
first
not
really
a
bad
beer
but
i
have
no
desire
to
drink
another
again
very
nice
pumpkin
flavors
upfrontbut
there
was
little
complexity
thereafter
burnt
orange
in
color
nice
creamy
white
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
of
pumpkin
spices
and
an
off
plastic
and
cooked
vegtable
smell
taste
is
an
almost
medicinal
like
blend
of
pumpkin
spices
with
minimal
emphasis
on
pumpkin
flavor
improved
greatly
as
it
warmed
light
bodied
creamy
but
overcarbonated
there
is
a
decent
flavor
profile
hidden
behind
all
that
is
off
the
drinkability
is
fair
its
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
its
very
mild
but
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
i
also
like
the
bottle
design
note
great
label
design
its
simple
and
minimalistic
but
he
orange
font
pops
on
the
black
background
on
the
main
label
and
the
opposite
color
scheme
on
the
neck
of
the
bottle
pours
a
coppery
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
quicklike
smells
of
spices
with
a
bit
of
pumpkin
undertone
taste
is
very
similar
although
a
bit
weak
starts
off
with
the
spices
and
then
mellows
into
the
pumpkin
flavors
at
the
end
its
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
but
its
not
a
bad
drinking
brew
overall
not
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
brews
out
there
but
i
think
this
is
a
bit
underrated
not
bad
at
all
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
dies
down
to
a
ring
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
behind
smells
kind
of
like
toasty
malts
with
some
pumpkin
spices
and
nutmeg
in
there
too
tastes
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
malts
nothing
too
complex
in
the
taste
the
taste
seems
to
fade
to
straight
spices
after
a
while
like
many
pumpkin
beers
mouthfeel
is
light
a
bit
creamy
with
a
good
carbonation
bite
and
no
alcohol
warming
drinkability
is
alright
the
taste
is
not
too
special
the
price
was
not
bad
the
spices
are
already
starting
to
kill
this
beer
as
with
many
pumpkin
ales
probably
wont
buy
again
cheers
drinkability
for
a
pumpkin
beer
or
any
kind
of
beer
for
that
matter
not
so
good
other
than
the
appearance
nothing
is
really
noteworthy
about
this
brew
smell
is
subdued
taste
is
off
not
a
total
drain
pour
but
close
i
really
didnt
care
for
the
flavor
profile
so
this
went
down
a
little
rough
overall
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
offering
not
sure
why
the
ratings
are
so
low
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
like
this
beer
true
to
the
style
with
an
earthy
and
raw
feel
of
fresh
pumpkin
mixed
with
a
spicy
bite
that
is
appropriate
for
the
fall
season
some
pumpkin
ales
make
the
mistake
of
adding
a
nasty
artificial
flavor
to
their
pumpkin
brews
but
that
is
not
the
case
here
and
i
respect
that
the
flip
side
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
could
drink
in
a
row
d
definitely
o
k
enough
to
drink
a
few
but
again
i
like
a
little
bit
more
zip
in
the
construction
of
the
brew
so
i
can
feel
comfortable
sipping
on
this
next
to
a
fire
without
it
flattening
out
completely
overall
as
a
pumkin
beer
like
we
or
i
am
use
to
this
really
isnt
that
good
as
the
lable
says
harvest
pumkin
ale
then
its
ok
even
without
the
pumkin
which
i
love
as
a
harvest
ale
it
is
just
an
ok
beer
a
lot
of
work
is
needed
on
the
malt
bill
body
even
tho
there
isnt
much
spices
i
enjoy
the
idea
of
a
hearty
beer
which
they
failed
to
hit
that
mark
with
a
solid
pumpkin
flavor
im
glad
i
gave
this
beer
a
try
but
i
dont
tink
ill
buying
this
again
great
idea
too
many
flaws
overall
not
bad
not
too
sweet
and
not
overloaded
with
spices
either
fairly
tasty
and
drinkable
but
not
as
good
as
the
oaked
jacked
edit
the
2010
version
is
actually
better
a
solid
malt
character
comes
through
spices
arent
too
potent
and
its
still
insanely
drinkable
now
id
say
its
highly
recommended
no
drain
pour
but
id
only
have
more
if
offered
for
free
thank
you
too
little
pumpkin
and
too
much
sweetness
and
spices
this
could
have
used
some
more
balance
and
definitely
more
body
this
just
didnt
hold
my
interest
for
very
long
drinkability
doesnt
offend
good
mouthfeel
its
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
consider
it
to
be
a
premier
pumpkin
ale
d
this
isnt
the
worst
beer
the
nose
is
kind
of
ok
till
you
pickup
the
old
tennis
shoe
in
the
background
better
than
bud
p
pours
light
brown
rather
clear
a
short
bubbly
head
that
quickly
dissipates
with
no
lacing
whatsoever
nose
is
very
cinnamon
up
front
with
some
background
sweets
taste
is
also
quite
spicy
in
the
beginning
but
it
gradually
dissipates
into
a
light
cinnamon
and
light
sweet
flavor
there
is
no
pumpkin
that
i
can
detect
goes
down
easy
at
first
but
then
becomes
rather
thin
and
flat
doesnt
hold
up
as
i
would
expect
bottle
bought
at
smiths
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
sweet
pumpkin
notes
some
toasted
malts
some
spices
cinnamon
and
cloves
mostly
the
taste
is
nice
and
relaxed
a
full
pumpkin
flavor
that
is
not
overwhelming
and
mixes
almost
totally
into
the
malt
profile
to
create
a
nice
smooth
and
toasted
flavor
some
spices
come
to
the
fore
and
the
finish
is
sweet
and
smooth
as
usual
uinta
makes
quality
beers
a
easy
and
quaffable
drink
but
also
well
crafted
and
tasty
got
one
of
these
off
a
friend
the
alternatives
werent
too
great
but
i
might
have
been
better
off
with
a
yuengling
overall
this
is
just
not
that
interesting
just
a
weak
aroma
and
flavor
of
slight
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
spiciness
but
nothing
much
else
here
to
keep
my
interest
much
better
off
to
go
with
something
like
dfh
punkin
or
southern
tier
pumking
the
two
top
beers
in
this
style
in
my
opinion
from
a
brown
12oz
bottle
pours
a
fairly
clear
reddishorange
with
a
slight
head
and
very
low
carbonation
smells
of
sweet
species
nutmeg
cloves
leading
the
way
with
mild
hop
presence
first
sip
is
sweet
but
too
sweet
the
spice
are
mellow
but
there
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
finishes
slightly
bitter
decent
mouthfeel
that
is
under
carbonated

due
to

drinkability
a
decent
rather
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
with
a
respectably
low
abv
overall
not
bad
at
all
very
mild
and
sessionable
surprisingly
good
pours
a
clear
brilliant
amber
with
2
fingers
of
foamy
eggshell
colored
head
good
retention
and
some
wisps
of
lacing
smells
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
bread
and
light
pumpkin
tastes
of
light
floral
hops
up
front
then
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
lots
of
grain
and
honey
malt
follow
with
not
much
happening
in
the
finish
besides
grain
light
in
body
and
high
in
carbonation
thin
but
some
crispness
grainy
with
some
spices
but
not
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
d
less
spiced
than
i
usually
like
but
a
good
beer
all
around
more
like
a
well
done
pale
ale
with
pumpkin
and
a
minor
dose
of
spice
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
dogfish
head
shaker
glass
appears
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
about
half
an
inch
of
offwhite
foam
that
disappears
in
under
30
seconds
this
one
actually
smells
and
tastes
of
roasted
pumpkins
somewhat
rare
in
pumpkin
beers
which
are
usually
dominated
with
spices
there
are
notes
of
allspice
nutmeg
and
bready
yeast
in
the
nose
but
they
are
lost
in
the
taste
all
im
getting
in
the
flavor
dept
are
pumpkin
and
metallics
a
notch
below
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
this
one
went
down
easy
enough
but
id
limit
this
to
a
bottle
a
year
if
i
had
an
empty
slot
to
fill
in
my
mixnmatch
six
pack
although
it
is
a
nice
alternative
to
all
the
high
abv
pumpkin
ales
that
seem
to
be
hitting
the
shelf
in
the
past
few
years
you
know
this
is
really
quite
a
nice
beer
nice
low
abv
for
a
change
of
pace
and
subtly
spiced
while
allowing
the
pumpkin
to
shine
through
tastes
fresh
as
well
pours
orange
toward
the
darker
end
of
the
spectrum
but
with
a
fairly
light
head
what
is
there
sticks
around
as
a
thin
ring
light
aroma
of
roasted
pumpkin
and
even
lighter
aroma
of
mace
subdued
but
pleasant
the
taste
is
also
nice
and
pumpkiny
with
some
subdued
but
noticeable
maxe
and
cinammon
as
well
as
a
perhaps
the
barest
amount
of
vanilla
very
smooth
and
the
earthy
vegetal
pumpkin
shines
through
the
most
almost
nutty
full
flavored
and
very
smooth
but
with
just
enough
spice
bite
to
keep
it
flavorful
this
is
the
way
to
do
a
low
abv
beer
very
enjoyable
my
wife
and
i
enjoyed
a
sixpack
of
these
mostly
clear
deep
pumpkin
orange
with
coppery
edges
small
persistent
lacy
creamy
light
khaki
head
caramel
cookie
dough
light
molasses
hints
of
baking
spices
some
pumpkin
pie
batter
and
a
little
metal
toasted
malt
and
astringent
grain
up
front
caramel
and
cookie
malt
follow
subtle
sweetness
pumpkin
pie
and
baking
spices
gently
drift
in
spicy
hop
presence
in
the
finish
not
bad
moderate
body
with
a
creamy
feel
a
rather
mild
malty
pumpkin
ale
that
goes
easy
on
the
spices
and
is
therefore
more
drinkable
d
nice
beer
nothing
earth
shattering
but
a
nice
beer
to
have
while
not
thinking
during
fall
i
dont
even
know
how
this
got
to
ny
overall
im
impressed
this
is
a
very
hard
style
to
pull
off
with
such
finesse
and
there
arent
many
that
i
can
give
a
4
5
to
for
drinkability
worth
trying
not
an
offensive
beer
in
fact
for
simply
being
an
ale
i
rather
enjoyed
it
however
a
pumpkin
beer
it
is
not
imo
drinkability
i
wasted
money
on
a
sixpack
id
never
heard
of
im
tempted
not
to
finish
the
first
one
and
the
other
five
will
likely
be
foisted
upon
an
unsuspecting
acquaintance
in
the
near
future
ive
had
worse
but
this
ones
not
worth
your
time
pours
a
reddish
golden
color
low
lying
white
head
with
no
head
retention
great
clarity
my
guess
is
filtered
which
could
be
causing
the
lack
of
pumpkin
flavor
cinnamon
clove
and
some
slight
vegetal
good
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lacking
as
it
is
thin
but
somehow
is
cloying
at
the
end
this
beer
being
from
salt
lake
i
cant
be
over
4abv
so
props
to
the
brewers
for
making
a
decent
brew
with
those
kind
of
restrictions
can
it
be
that
this
recipe
would
send
you
singing
if
they
didnt
have
the
state
of
utah
overseeing
their
procedures
i
would
hope
so
but
as
is
its
not
giving
me
a
reason
to
warm
up
my
voice
overall
a
tasty
light
and
sessionable
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
decent
dense
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
light
brown
sugar
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
allspice
noticable
pumpkin
ale
aromas
wow
the
taste
falls
flat
the
flavor
is
of
watery
grain
with
some
light
pumpkin
spice
flavors
thats
about
it
the
feel
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
it
has
that
light
macro
astrigent
feel
a
beginners
pumpkin
ale
it
has
the
very
basic
flavor
yet
it
still
resembles
a
light
macro
lager
i
prefer
my
pumpkin
ales
much
maltier
with
more
robust
flavor
wasnt
terribly
impressed
with
this
one
i
didnt
hate
it
by
any
means
but
theres
nothing
to
love
here
either
bland
uninspired
too
simple
average
at
best
and
something
i
likely
wouldnt
revisit
given
the
amount
of
tasty
pumpkin
beers
to
be
found
in
the
fall
cant
recommend
this
one
i
have
2
questions
why
did
the
brewer
bother
what
the
hell
am
gonna
do
with
other
five
beers
disappointing

beautiful

very

pour
with

including
cinnamon

black

clove
along
with
hints
of

vanilla
and
subtle
dark

the

cinnamon
maple

the

overall
this
is
one
big

boozey
pumpkin

the
barrel
aging
dominates
and
its
extremely
rich
making
it
a
sipper
for
sure
it
was
a
bit
boozey
for
me
so
im
going
to
put
the
other
bottle
i
have
in
the
cellar
and
see
what
happens
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
scent
you
get
from
aging
an
ale
in
oak
barrels
which
generally
correlates
to
a
tasty
beer
this
was
again
the
case
even
flavors
all
around
the
spices
the
pumpkin
and
oak
barrels
a
dark
brown
color
with
very
little
opacity
feels
nice
a
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
with
a
very
light
head
its
late
in
the
season
however
i
can
say
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
especially
at
10
31
snag
it
if
you
have
the
chance
or
try
it
next
fall
the
beautiful
taste
that
suggests
pumpkin
pie
taste
in
beer
form
finishes
differently
it
dries
to
a
midsweet
term
with
spicy
heat
and
spice
from
dry
oak
spice
additions
and
elevated
alcohol
heat
what
transpires
afterward
is
a
taste
of
rum
cake
chestnut
and
port
wine
as
palate
fatigue
would
normally
accompany
such
taste
im
wishing
for
more
of
this
pumpkin
ale
and
blue
cheese
pairing
pours
a
mahogany
red
with
a
nice
head
smells
of
plum
alcohol
caramel
tastes
kind
of
like
a
light
barleywine
some
sweetness
a
little
tart
i
get
some
vanilla
and
then
the
pumpkin
spices
show
up
in
the
finish
theres
a
pretty
good
alcohol
presence
and
some
burn
kind
of
full
bodied
maybe
a
little
too
much
carbonation
seems
like
theres
a
little
co2
burn
overall
good
brew
might
be
better
with
a
little
age
on
it
recommended
serving
the
beer
at
a
colder
temp
overall
this
beer
could
age
a
bit
longer
to
mellow
out
pumpkin
flavors
are
a
bit
hard
to
pick
up
due
to
the
oak
still
a
solid
beer

without
being

one

very

enticing
the
trend
continues
on
the
palate
where
the
oak

is
again
at
the

beneath
the
surface
are
some
pumpkin

adds

the

its

definitely
worth
a
try
overall
interesting
and
all
though
its

takes
some
time
always
curious
as
to
how
a

would
affect
a

charateristics
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
hint
of
cinnamon
oakywoodiness
touch
of
caramel
malt
and
booze
i
liked
how
smooth
the
beer
is
how
heavy
the
pumpkin
and
other
spices
come
into
play
and
the
sweetness
i
get
on
some
sips
the
only
thing
with
this
beer
is
at
times
the
alcohol
really
came
into
play
and
i
dont
think
the
booziness
mixed
well
with
the
pumpkin
spices
or
the
sweetness
so
at
times
it
was
disjointed
o
the
base
beer
is
nice
and
not
too
spiced
and
then
the
oak
barrels
add
a
nice
bit
of
complexity
doesnt
go
overboard
on
either
aspect
which
is
quite
an
accomplishment
a
great
sipper
for
halloween
and
the
fall
season
if
i
do
say
so
myself
i
wonder
how
technical
they
got
to
get
the
abv
to
exactly
10
31
if
its
true
thats
incredible
deep
amber
hue
with
an
off
white
head
this
is
quite
complex
and
just
a
touch
too
boozy
for
me
but
it
somehow
fits
the
style
a
lot
of
cinnamon
booze
vanilla
pumpkin
flesh
caramel
malt
and
oak
in
that
order
from
most
prominent
taste
massive
fruity
overtones
of
plums
and
dates
strong
pumpkin
puree
oak
vanilla
slight
pines
and
a
continuous
juicy
pumpkin
cream
flavor
throughout
the
palate
the
finish
brings
a
resinous
creamy
milk
sweet
yeast
and
sugar
slick
syrupy
pumpkin
molasses
overall
this
beer
is
massively
complex
there
is
the
vanillaoak
overtones
from
the
barrels
and
the
strong
pumpkin
overtones
work
well
with
that
this
is
a
really
fantastic
imperial
pumpkin
ales
among
the
best
of
the
style
ill
admit
most
pumpkin
beers
in
the
past
never
lived
up
to
my
expectations
but
with
a
bigger
push
for
the
imperial
pumpkin
ales
i
am
all
over
it
of
course
they
still
have
to
be
balanced
and
the
spicing
cant
be
out
of
control
the
least
bit
uinta
does
a
stellar
job
with
this
one
cheers
much
smoother
and
tame
as
i
suspected
warm
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
came
through
tasted
much
like
a
strong
english
barleywine
this
could
still
go
a
couple
more
years
and
probably
be
even
better
still
the
booziness
although
still
there
was
much
less
than
when
it
was
fresh
i
enjoyed
this
but
back
to
my
original
review
from
a
year
ago
its
lacking
on
the
pumpkin
i
like
the
complexity
in
the
flavor
and
i
think
the
strength
of
the
beer
works
nicely
with
the
flavors
they
present
the
pumpkin
aspect
is
a
bit
overshadowed
by
this
strength
but
all
in
all
a
brew
i
would
recommend
trying
to
anyone
spices
are
also
in
check
which
is
key
too
many
abuse
that
whoa
big
beer
poured
slightly
warm
with
a
giant
tan
slow
to
settle
thick
foamy
head
and
good
lacing
color
is
a
clear
deep
amber
with
few
bubble
trails
aroma
is
oaked
pumpkin
malt
spice
hops
flavors
like
nose
with
everything
much
more
bold
sweet
and
tang
are
out
front
and
bitter
brings
up
a
strong
long
lasting
end
body
is
full
round
alcohol
warm
with
just
enough
bitter
to
keep
it
interesting
finish
is
like
flavor
and
as
stated
above
rich
so
one
big
bottle
is
plenty
o
a
beer
pumpkin
with
the
spice
and
oak
notes
giving
a
sort
of
belgian
ale
impression
there
is
a
noticeable
amount
of
alcohol
but
its
kept
in
check
with
by
a
fair
amount
of
malt
sweetness
and
body
the
woodoak
characteristics
definitely
dominate
so
if
youre
a
fan
of
that
then
youll
definitely
love
this
the
oak
barrels
definitely
take
this
beer
to
the
next
level
without
them
this
would
just
be
your
average
imperial
pumpkin
ale
its
ultimately
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
guess
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
but
its
not
bad
at
all
and
i
can
totally
appreciate
it
and
see
the
appeal
it
is
complex
too
i
probably
shouldve
let
this
one
age
a
bit
some
age
would
definitely
turn
this
beer
into
something
else
most
likely
for
the
better

i
dont

the
mouth
feel
is
a

and
overall
a
ok
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
let
it
age
again
i
think
it
would
be
better
fresh
o
i
found
this
beer
in
my
cellar
leftover
from
last
years
pumpkin
season
i
had
no
intention
of
aging
it
for
a
year
i
just
forgot
about
it
the
emergence
of
pumpkin
beers
on
the
shelf
once
again
jogged
my
memory
this
one
was
pretty
good
but
i
expected
more
from
an
oak
aged
pumpkin
beer
retailing
for
1214
the
usual
pumpkin
flavors
are
there
along
with
a
sweet
caramelmarshmallow
character
but
i
dont
think
this
is
any
better
than
a
lot
of
the
readily
available
imperial
pumpkin
offerings
that
cost
around
half
as
much
weyerbacher
schlafly
pumking
etc
overall
this
is
a
hell
of
a
beer
deliciously
sweet
and
complex
and
the
pumpkin
base
worked
well
a
touch
sweet
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
in
fall
d
great
barrel
aged
pumpkin
ale
nice
blend
of
spices
nice
sweet
winter
ale
warm
and
pleasant
and
comforting
o
this
is
very
enjoyable
brew
and
is
a
little
different
in
a
positive
way
from
the
other
pumpkin
beers
that
i
have
experienced
really
like
the
contribution
of
the
oak
and
what
it
imparted
to
the
flavor
and
aroma
i
wish
that
the
alcohol
had
been
a
little
subtle
in
this
one
it
made
the
beer
very
much
a
slow
sipper
do
this
strong
pumpkin
ale
is
a
pleasure
to
behold
it
strikes
a
nearperfect
stance
incorporating
attention
to
the
signature
ingredient
a
mature
application
of
woodaging
and
enduring
awareness
that
this
is
a
beer
it
remains
capable
of
being
enjoyed
as
beer
with
a
clear
attention
to
details
exhibited
by
the
brewer
hard
to
find
fault
with
perhaps
its
greatest
transgression
is
that
it
remains
a
beer
brewed
with
pumpkin
o
a
awesome
pumpkin
beer
gorgeous
looks
great
flavor
profile
with
an
excellent
pumpkin
character

and
stellar

overall
i
decided
to
take
on
this
750ml
all
by
myself
just
to
make
sure
i
had
enough
wait
i
ran
out
already
its
fairly
good
but
i
would
still
lean
toward
pumking
as
this
came
across
as
a
wee
bit
hot
for
me
medium
in
body
sweet
throughout
the
palate
surprisingly
a
lot
of
pumpkin
comes
through
in
the
flavor
mildly
enjoyable
beer
good
oakiness
and
barrel
notes
minimal
spice
it
is
a
decent
beer
and
id
consider
having
it
again
o
its
a
good
pumpkin
ale
that
has
just
the
right
amount
of
oak
and
bourbon
without
being
overly
boozy
this
one
works
well

into

after

so
many
pumpkin

both
pretty
good

neither
is
quite
great
the
nose

some
nice
maple
sweetness
thats
counterbalanced
by
the
traditional
cinnamon

nutmeg
pumpkin
pie
spices
the
flavor
profile
brings
in
some
vanilla
to
support
the
maple
in
laying
down
a
sweet
base
the
pumpkin
spices
show
up
well
in
the
back
end
and
theyre
complemented
nicely
by
some
earthy
spicy
oak
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
the
body
is
firmly
middle
of
the
road
for
such
a
big
beer
neither
as
full
as
a
stout
or
barleywine
nor
as
dry
as
a
strong
belgian
ale
and
the
carbonation
has
just
a
little
bit
of
zip
to
it
ive
found
that
brewing
a
high
abv
pumpkin
ale
is
a
bit
of
a
challenge
in
terms
of
keeping
both
the
sweetness
and
the
spice
character
in
check
and
with
the
aid
of
oak
aging
uinta
does
an
admirable
job
here
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
oak
aged
here
but
if
thats
what
you
like
give
it
a
try
the
oak
i
think
added
to
a
cloyingness
that
i
didnt
really
care
for
poured
in
to
nb
globe
glass
appearance
is
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
generous
amount
of
loose
white
head
heavy
lacing
is
left
behind
nice
head
retention
as
well
nose
starts
with
pumpkin
spices
predominantly
all
spice
next
is
an
onslaught
of
vanilla
which
is
backed
up
by
a
bit
of
oak
character
the
barrel
comes
through
and
provides
a
slight
twinge
of
mustiness
the
end
features
some
raw
vegetal
pumpkin
notes
taste
is
rather
sweet
with
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
among
other
pumpkin
spices
the
oak
is
incredibly
mild
on
the
palate
which
is
unfortunate
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
hearty
body
and
mild
carbonation
overall
this
one
falls
a
little
short
the
vanilla
is
nice
but
the
pumpkin
is
somewhat
bland
and
it
seems
that
the
oak
doesnt
do
any
favors
for
this
brew
o
this
one
sounded
better
than
it
actually
turned
out
to
be
too
much
pumpkin
is
a
bad
thing
for
me
would
definitely
repeat
this
one
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
drinkability
isnt
too
high
its
a
hot
fairly
thin
spicy
beer
the
oak
is
nice
and
the
ethanol
is
relatively
clean
so
its
not
really
flawed
its
just
in
need
a
of
redesign
more
malt
maybe
some
esters
d
this
is
a
pretty
decent
pumpkin
beer
the
booziness
takes
away
from
this
being
a
more
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
o
i
love
uintas
barrel
aging
program
and
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
this
is
a
big
one
and
seems
to
draw
much
inspiration
from
the
barley
wine
style
the
barrel
aging
is
done
right
with
the
oak
character
asserting
itself
without
becoming
too
dominant
the
spicing
while
initially
a
bit
disjointed
and
shocking
ended
up
melting
away
into
the
background
to
provide
a
nice
supporting
role
this
is
easily
the
heftiest
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
its
really
hitting
the
spot
right
now
especially
with
the
threat
of
hurricane
sandy
looming
if
youre
going
to
spend
a
blustery
autumn
night
sealed
in
at
home
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
on
hand
poured
into
a
chalice
a
nice
deep
reddishamber
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
mostly
malty
with
some
nice
cinammon
nutmeg
clove
notes
the
taste
is
malty
slightly
bitter
pretty
close
to
a
pumpkin
pie
very
slight
oak
notes
medium
body
abv
hidden
very
well
overall
a
pretty
tasty
brew
for
over
a
year
old
this
brew
was
very
very
hard
to
get
in
utah
considering
the
fucking
place
is
about
30
miles
from
my
house
this
is
not
the
first
time
uinta
has
fucked
up
getting
brews
to
people
here
in
utahslc
they
seem
to
care
more
about
getting
beers
outside
of
utah
for
the
last
couple
of
years
not
very
cool
thanks
chuck
for
hooking
me
up
the
appearance
is
gorgeous
a
deep
amber
orange
color
with
one
of
the
best
heads
ive
experienced
no
not
like
that
i
think
its
where
the
creaminess
comes
from
it
puffs
up
a
lot
at
first
and
then
remains
throughout
the
pint
its
all
really
great
4o
great
pumpkin
beer
from
what
i
can
tell
definitely
one
to
drink
fresh
from
this
bottle
recommended
without
reservation
do
yourself
a
favor
and
give
it
a
try
o
i
like
imperial
pumpkin
ales
and
ive
had
a
few
i
enjoy
the
rich
strong
and
bold
pumpkin
and
spice
and
i
appreciate
the
addition
of
other
flavors
like
those
imparted
by
the
oak
barrelaging
so
i
happen
to
have
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
more
complex
than
a
pumking
and
not
as
lightbrighttasting
as
a
smashed
pumpkin
it
reminded
me
of
a
lighter
version
of
heavy
seas
greater
pumpkin
which
is
bourbon
barrelaged
and
has
a
heavier
and
sweeter
almost
overthetop
flavor
what
im
leading
up
to
is
that
all
of
the
aforementioned
beers
are
my
favorite
imperial
pumpkin
ales
and
this
beer
gladly
fits
among
them
it
may
even
surpass
some
of
them
bottomline
a
must
have
for
any
fan
of
the
style
o
one
of
the
better
if
not
the
best
barrel
aged
pumpkin
ales
though
how
many
have
i
really
had
i
guess
nice
balance
of
flavors
pumpkin
spices
arent
too
overpowering
and
neither
is
the
bourbon
it
all
just
works
together
pretty
well
not
sure
how
well
the
oak
barrels
were
utilized
here
but
its
a
cool
beer
overall
a
nice
change
up
from
the
spicesinyourface
pumpkin
ales
definitely
a
sipper
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
a
little
above
average
overall
i
really
liked
it
i
especially
liked
that
it
wasnt
another
over
spiced
pumpkin
beer
it
tasted
like
someone
sprinkled
brown
sugar
on
a
pumpkin
and
roasted
it
with
some
oak
wood
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
and
i
really
appreciated
that
it
was
different
from
the
other
pumpkin
beers
out
there
pours
a
leaves
changing
colors
autumn
red
with
a
thin
cap
of
light
tan
foam
partial
head
retention
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
pumpkin
pie
with
a
heavy
dose
of
nutmeg
yam
and
a
dash
of
cardamom
more
pumpkin
pie
spiciness
coming
through
in
the
flavor
meshing
well
with
a
toasted
oakvanilla
a
pinch
of
cinnamon
lingers
on
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
enough
carbonation
to
keep
the
palette
refreshed
and
the
lovely
aromas
perking
up
from
the
glass
delicious
blend
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
melding
well
with
the
oak
might
be
picking
up
another
one
for
the
cellar
while
admittedly
ive
far
from
sampled
all
that
the
hoard
of
pumpkin
seasonals
crowding
the
shelves
these
days
has
to
offer
this
is
by
far
the
most
complex
the
oak
aging
really
adds
a
great
depth
and
i
really
liked
how
boozey
it
is
alot
of
good
stuff
going
on
im
definately
going
to
pick
up
another
bottle
or
two
to
enjoy
and
to
perhaps
try
aging
oquite
disappointed
with
this
one
tastes
like
a
boozey
dfh
punkin
not
getting
the
oak
that
i
was
looking
forward
to
solid
not
must
try
ive
been
pumped
to
try
this
beer
for
awhile
as
the
crooked
line
series
has
always
been
really
good
and
i
love
pumpkin
brews
it
pours
surprisingly
clear
dark
orange
in
color
with
a
lazy
bubbly
tan
head
lots
of
little
bubbles
rising
up
and
a
great
glow
the
nose
is
very
very
complex
and
seasonally
perfect
tons
of
fresh
pumpkin
and
vanilla
and
oak
a
little
less
on
the
seasonal
spice
but
still
plenty
of
nutmeg
and
clove
going
on
at
the
finish
the
oak
has
done
wonders
to
this
thing
id
love
to
see
more
pumpkin
brews
aged
this
way
its
mellow
and
the
squash
is
allowed
to
bring
all
its
autumnal
sugars
and
startches
to
the
flavor
which
adds
a
lot
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
overly
full
on
the
body
and
good
carbonation
the
alcohol
which
is
cleverly
10
31
is
not
hardly
detectable
which
i
find
incredible
its
still
a
massive
beer
but
its
eerily
drinkable
ill
be
buying
more
of
these
without
a
doubt
this
is
one
id
like
to
share
back
east
over
thanksgiving
its
a
beautiful
brew
t
lots
of
oak
right
away
with
some
nice
pumpkin
flavor
some
slight
hints
of
cinnamon
and
spices
with
some
caramel
malt
mouthfeel
definitely
doesnt
make
this
beer
seem
as
high
in
alcohol
as
it
is
smooth
and
tasty
but
not
as
much
pumpkin
as
i
would
probably
like
pours
a
dark
transparent
mahogany
color
with
a
foamy
cream
cap
decent
retention
notes
of
bourbon
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
oak
barrel
certainly
pumpkin
and
holiday
spices
allspice
cinnamon
cardamom
nutmeg
alcohol
well
hidden

o
not
a
bad
beer
nice
spin
on
the
pumpkin
beer
that
i
am
used
to
i
might
revisit
this
one
this
coming
thanksgiving
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
amber
color
with
some
shades
of
brown
in
there
too
the
head
was
cream
colored
and
foamy
looking
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
heavy
amount
of
spices
on
the
nose
there
is
a
hint
of
the
oak
in
there
too
which
i
thought
was
a
good
additional
element
the
taste
has
a
good
amount
of
spice
that
balance
out
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
to
it
with
a
thick
feeling
body
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
overall
i
have
to
say
i
like
it
there
are
bits
that
dont
work
but
it
was
a
worthy
experiment
and
certainly
something
id
be
tempted
to
pick
up
again
this
has
about
six
months
of
age
on
it
but
it
feels
like
it
could
probably
support
even
more
which
is
a
good
sign
of
itself
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
but
an
interesting
one
nonetheless
o
overall
very
easy
to
consume
nice
spectrum
of
spicing
not
overally
exaggerated
but
rather
all
working
and
blending
nicely
together
solid
sweet
toasty
malt
base
finishes
out
a
solid
good
example
pours
a
medium
red
orange
amber
thin
coarse
off
white
head
dissipates
to
a
ring
leaving
short
lived
lacing
very
light
aroma
of
pumpkin
malt
and
very
faint
pumpkin
pie
spices
pumpkin
flavor
dominates
with
some
light
maltiness
pumpkin
pie
spices
somewhat
dry
finish
with
some
light
oak
slightly
spicy
creamy
and
medium
bodied
a
nicely
made
pumpkin
a
little
on
the
dry
woody
side
for
me
this
is
the
last
beer
in
the
crooked
line
series
for
me
to
try
and
it
is
my
favorite
although
its
in
a
different
class
ill
say
its
much
better
than
their
punkn
ale
as
well
a
pretty
decent
but
not
great
imperial
pumpkin
finally
got
around
to
crackin
this
open
after
a
lengthy
stay
in
the
fridge
poured
from
a
75ml
corked
caged
bottle
into
a
firestone
walker
tulip
bottle
opens
with
a
solid
pop
indicative
of
a
good
level
of
carbonation
beer
pours
a
brilliant
clear
but
dark
orangishbrown
with
a
fingers
width
head
that
is
very
effervescent
and
quick
fading
the
nose
is
very
eloquent
indeed
very
spicy
with
clove
nutmeg
a
tad
bit
of
cinnamon
as
with
moth
pumpkin
beers
i
dont
really
pick
up
any
pumpkin
the
taste
is
where
its
at
this
has
a
heavy
yet
still
wonderfully
balanced
spice
profile
with
all
of
the
aforementioned
players
coming
to
the
forefront
once
again
i
wish
the
barrel
treatment
was
a
little
more
evident
and
wonder
what
could
have
been
with
bourbon
barrels
surprisingly
the
alcohol
isnt
very
pronounced
in
the
taste
but
it
rears
its
head
in
the
mouthfeel
providing
a
bit
of
a
hot
finish
the
spice
of
this
beer
lingers
on
your
palate
for
a
decent
length
of
time
too
over
all
not
bad
at
all
this
is
a
very
decent
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
from
uinta
i
may
not
necessarily
seek
this
out
again
as
pumpkin
beers
generally
arent
my
forte
but
i
wouldnt
snicker
at
someone
if
they
offered
it
id
extend
my
glass
at
arms
length
good
brew
this
is
medium
bodied
with
ample
prickly
carbonation
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
pumpkin
is
hardly
noticeable
but
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
if
i
can
find
it
next
year
cheers
o
a
great
pumpkin
brew
id
drink
this
one
again
started
my
thanksgiving
off
right
with
this
one
and
im
not
disappointed
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
laces
well
the
aroma
is
a
clean
pumpkin
smell
the
taste
is
exactly
what
it
should
be
pumpkin
and
spice
not
watery
and
not
overpowering
a
perfect
balance
of
ingredients
gives
this
a
smooth
almost
velvety
mouthfeel
and
a
taste
that
puts
you
in
the
season
nice
warming
abv
but
well
hidden
i
like
a
good
crazy
experiment
beer
now
and
then
overall
i
was
expecting
more
to
be
honest
here
for
the
inflated
price
tag
and
the
limited
availability
i
would
have
preferred
a
more
complex
flavor
profile
reminded
me
a
lot
of
the
great
higher
abv
pumpkin
ales
out
there
like
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
and
hoppin
frog
double
hollow
pumpkin
but
there
was
no
really
no
added
oak
complexity
from
the
barrels
a
really
good
beer
but
a
let
down
overall
and
not
worth
seeking
out
in
my
opinion
just
because
there
is
more
readily
available
better
bang
for
the
buck
imperial
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
overall
i
would
absolutely
buy
this
ale
again
i
am
curious
to
see
how
this
brew
ages
and
i
will
write
a
review
next
year
if
it
stands
out
o
i
am
glad
that
i
bought
a
few
of
these
o
a
good
pumpkin
ale
the
oak
adds
some
interesting
notes
its
a
bit
pricy
but
is
still
better
than
most
pumpkin
ales
o
it
was
decent
but
i
wasnt
too
impressed
overall
there
just
want
enough
of
a
pumpkin
profile
at
any
stage
in
consuming
this
beer
oak
was
also
pretty
damn
offensive
which
was
offputting
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
at
price
over
7ish
just
mediocre
not
bad
at
all
the
barrels
impart
a
subtle
oakiness
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
impact
from
them
but
the
pumpkinspice
blend
is
sweet
and
smooth
taste
is
some
oak
autumn
maple
like
needs
more
pumpkin
for
an
imperial
pumpkin
beer
very
surprised
at
the
lack
of
pumpkin
expected
more
another
sign
of
life
in
utahs
challenging
beer
environment
if
we
were
giving
points
for
labels
this
one
is
outstanding
cheers
to
uinta
for
an
interestingly
different
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
oa
must
buy
for
my
celler
for
the
spiced
pumpkin
ale
fix
any
hotness
in
this
will
surely
be
cured
with
a
bit
of
aging
very
nice
effort
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
and
would
definitely
buy
it
again
if
i
ever
find
more
it
is
rich
delicious
and
probably
one
of
my
top
34
for
the
style
along
with
schlafly
and
ccb
good
gourd
highly
recommended
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
d
a
beer
that
is
probably
best
served
in
4oz
glasses
paired
with
dessert
definitely
one
of
the
strongest
offerings
ive
had
in
this
style
but
not
something
i
urgently
need
to
revisit
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
but
i
still
like
southern
tiers
version
better
great
marketing
on
the
bottles
of
these
crooked
line
series
just
had
to
say
it
my
first
oak
aged
beer
and
it
happens
to
be
a
pumpkin
one
at
that
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
great
pumpkin
spice
smell
taste
is
really
good
and
creamy
nice
balance
of
pumpkin
flavors
and
the
oakiness
really
adds
a
great
touch
alcohol
a
bit
strong
but
overall
its
a
good
blend
and
the
pumpkin
doesnt
feel
overdone
solid
beer
for
sure
give
it
a
try
d
a
great
pumpkin
beer
amidst
some
rather
disappointing
ones
i
have
tried
over
the
years
smooth
but
tastes
dynamic
and
very
enjoyable
the
oak
aging
really
created
some
unique
nuances
in
this
a
big
brew
but
not
dominating
on
the
sweet
side
but
sessionable
enough
very
interesting
but
not
amazing
an
offering
that
becomes
excellent
as
a
seasonal
overall
an
ok
pumpkin
its
subdued
even
though
its
10
the
spices
seem
a
bit
muddled
and
its
overly
sweet
to
my
tastes
overall
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tasted
recently
compared
with
other
imperial
barrel
aged
brews
i
dont
think
it
would
quite
stack
up
but
compared
fairly
to
other
pumpkin
ales
its
a
winner
i
love
a
good
barrel
aged
beer
especially
with
bourbon
barrels
and
pumpkin
ales
beautiful
deep
dark
color
that
looks
like
an
elegant
tennessee
whiskey
the
aroma
has
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
that
entices
your
mouth
to
take
a
sip
once
the
beer
hits
your
tongue
your
taste
buds
are
filled
with
pleasures
of
pumpkin
and
spice
accentuated
by
the
barrel
aging
like
i
said
in
the
beginning
im
in
love
with
barrel
aged
brews
and
this
is
one
of
them
nice
job
uinta
o
overall
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
not
my
favorite
but
good
nose
is
dominated
by
the
spices
but
the
pumpkin
comes
out
more
in
the
taste
girlfriend
like
it
a
lot
would
have
it
again
o
really
solid
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
its
not
the
normal
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
oak
aging
it
really
did
something
unique
to
this
brew
it
was
pretty
well
balanced
and
just
tasted
quite
excellent
next
to
the
spicebag
versions
that
some
breweries
put
out
although
i
do
tend
to
like
the
spice
bag
versions
as
well
not
knocking
them
just
saying
this
ones
different
notes
pretty
likable
and
quite
the
opposite
pumpkin
extreme
from
their
session
gourd
offering
good
quality
crooked
line
offering
and
a
nice
sipper
to
share
overall
this
is
a
really
good
pumpkin
beer
its
no
pumking
and
it
costs
more
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
oak
jacked
is
somewhere
between
the
average
and
good
end
of
the
imperial
pumpkin
patch
the
one
disappointment
is
that
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
hard
to
detect
among
the
other
flavors
because
there
is
so
much
going
on
yet
the
overall
flavor
makes
this
beer
hard
to
argue
against
overall
the
spices
are
too
subdued
for
my
liking
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidded
i
liked
the
oak
character
o
great
imperial
pumpkin
style
first
ive
had
of
this
style
impressive
great
job
uinta
i
gotta
believe
this
is
better
than
the
uinta
standard
pumpkin
ale
poured
a
deep
rich
bronzeamber
with
a
thinner
white
head
atopgood
clarity
to
the
body
deep
pumpkin
pie
spicevanillaand
toasty
oak
ion
the
nosea
little
sweet
alcohol
comes
into
play
as
well
a
little
thinner
in
the
mouth
for
such
a
big
beerclove
spice
and
mace
on
the
palate
with
a
little
roasted
pumpkin
and
toasty
oakas
the
beer
warms
the
sweet
alcohol
shows
thru
more
a
very
nice
imperial
pumpkin
alethe
oak
doesnt
add
much
but
a
little
toastiness
that
enhances
the
beer
morei
like
it
mo
very
good
weight
and
not
too
overpowering
because
of
the
alcohol
content
very
good
warmer
type
beer
in
every
sense
of
the
word
my
wife
picked
this
one
up
to
share
with
me
on
my
birthday
last
weekend
poured
a
nice
hazy
brown
color
with
a
good
taupe
head
that
hangs
around
for
awhile
nice
aromas
of
roasted
nuts
pumpkin
pie
spices
oak
and
maybe
a
little
lightly
roasted
malt
somewhat
sweet
and
almost
cloying
on
the
palate
with
some
roasted
malt
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
oak
honestly
ive
never
experienced
pumpkin
in
a
beer
quite
like
i
have
with
this
one
it
really
is
unique
whereas
most
pumpkin
beers
tend
to
be
an
amber
with
pumpkin
spice
this
is
a
real
pumpkin
beer
though
a
little
pricey
this
is
definietly
a
beer
that
fits
the
season
and
is
worth
trying
once
if
for
nothing
else
than
to
see
how
pumpkin
can
be
represented
in
a
beer
both
in
terms
of
flavor
and
texture
o
uintas
oak
jacked
imperial
pumpkin
easily
ranks
near
the
top
of
the
pumpkin
beer
echelon
nary
a
brash
or
overdone
spice
is
to
be
found
and
the
wood
adds
a
really
inviting
complexity
to
the
beer
which
is
perfect
for
a
chilly
autumn
evening
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
i
highly
recommend
checking
this
one
out
this
is
what
id
call
a
grownups
pumpkin
ale
bready
and
spicy
palate
pie
crust
caramel
and
molasses
a
touch
of
bal
that
doesnt
overwhelm
the
base
beer
the
spices
thankfully
dont
either
its
surprisingly
well
balanced
cinnamon
is
pronounced
along
with
nutmeg
and
clove
but
they
dont
provide
much
astringency
as
is
often
the
case
with
these
spiced
pumpkin
ales
surprisingly
good
on
the
whole
and
better
as
it
warms
o
my
new
favorite
pumpkin
beer
if
uinta
fixed
the
carbonation
problem
i
think
this
would
overtake
pumking
for
the
best
pumkin
beer
out
there
will
definitely
try
next
year
very
good
pumpkin
orangebrown
color
with
a
bit
of
haziness
to
it
nice
moderate
offwhite
head
smell
is
a
bit
strong
of
oak
wood
and
a
mild
amount
of
spice
not
a
whole
lot
else
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
incredible
very
little
oak
comes
to
play
and
what
is
there
really
amps
up
the
flavor
of
the
pumpkin
im
not
getting
much
spice
on
the
palette
but
rather
a
very
strong
very
creamy
pumpkin
flavor
hands
down
best
pumpkin
only
flavor
ive
gotten
out
of
this
style
slight
hints
at
maple
vanilla
and
cinnamonclove
but
pumpkin
is
all
center
stage
creamy
in
the
mouth
fizz
plays
well
great
pumpkin
beer
a
pleasant
surprise
i
applaud
this
for
sure
pours
a
very
nice
dark
shade
of
brown
with
some
light
orange
and
average
head
smells
of
pumpkin
and
a
cinnamon
but
not
much
oak
flavors
mirror
the
aroma
but
the
cinnamon
is
a
little
more
pronounced
nice
dry
use
of
the
pumpkin
and
pairing
with
the
clove
overall
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
is
a
very
solid
pumpkin
beer
wish
the
oak
flavoring
would
have
come
through
more
as
thats
one
of
the
unique
feature
that
attracted
me
to
the
beer
in
the
first
place
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
barrel
qualities
were
well
integrated
and
not
overpowering
at
all
o
sadly
disappointed
with
this
one
it
just
falls
very
short
in
the
taste
i
just
personally
think
the
oak
is
too
aggressive
in
this
one
it
totally
over
powers
the
great
pumpkin
flavors
that
i
think
are
in
there
or
are
they
o
pretty
disappointing
stuff
sadly
as
much
of
their
other
stuff
has
impressed
its
flavors
are
muddy
and
sweet
finishing
o
less
than
stellar
pours
a
dark
copper
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
pumpkin
pie
spices
vanilla
and
some
wood
notes
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
and
pumpkin
puree
up
front
while
the
various
spices
and
slight
vanilla
flavor
coming
in
on
the
finish
the
spices
add
a
sight
earthy
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
i
am
not
really
getting
any
of
the
oak
flavors
in
the
taste
though
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
with
a
nice
balance
of
all
the
flavors
the
smell
is
not
as
good
as
the
taste
but
this
is
still
a
worthy
beer
to
pick
up
for
the
season
interesting
to
see
that
the
abv
is
at
10
31
halloween
i
am
not
too
sure
how
they
can
get
it
so
exact
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
wish
there
was
some
more
on
the
shelves
here
in
chicago
this
just
became
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
pumpkin
beers
cheers
beautiful
pour

red

fantastic

cloves
vanilla
eggnog
oven
baked

sweet
tasting
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
to
prevent
it
from
becoming
too
cloying
spieced
sweet
potato
and
marshmellows
wow
this
is
really
quite
nice
very
smooth
mouthfeel
creamy
velvety
alcohol
is
warming
but
oh
so
very
well
hidden
overall
this
is
bar
none
the
very
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
exceptional
in
style
and
quite
nice
and
well
rounded
as
a
whole
highest
recommendation
for
a
halloween
treat
overall
great
nice
malts
nice
pumpkin
addition
booze
is
very
well
hidden
nice
buttery
oak
smooth
and
tasty
and
goes
down
much
easier
than
i
expected
overall
not
bad
i
wouldnt
call
this
an
exceptional
pumpkin
ale
but
definitely
better
than
average
i
would
like
to
have
tasted
this
without
the
barrel
treatment
o
something
different
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
probably
one
of
my
favorites
this
season
still
i
cant
figure
out
how
the
aroma
can
be
so
muted
in
comparison
to
the
excellent
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
part
two
of
two
in
my
utahn
pumpkin
beer
minifete
the
little
cousin
was
pretty
nice
so
this
one
has
some
lofty
expectations
to
live
up
to
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
tawnyamber
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
dirty
pale
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
biscuits
light
caramel
light
nutmeg
rye
bread
oak
light
clove
and
a
few
drops
of
mandarin
orange
syrup
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lightly
toasted
rye
bread
charred
oak
caramel
mandarin
orange
nutmeg
brown
sugar
toasted
pumpkin
seeds
light
booze
and
a
dripping
of
maple
syrup
the
body
is
a
sleek
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
syrupy
feel
overall
this
did
not
live
up
to
the
expectations
preceding
it
the
spices
have
been
mostly
muted
the
alcohol
makes
itself
far
too
known
the
oak
seems
to
be
a
bit
on
the
blackened
side
and
the
balance
that
held
punkn
so
well
has
disappeared
in
his
relative
here
its
not
a
bad
beer
really
just
one
that
disappointed
a
bit
o
makes
me
happy
i
have
one
more
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
to
date
really
well
balanced
and
i
feel
the
pumpkin
is
actually
present
as
apposed
to
just
the
spices
you
normally
find
in
pumpkin
pie
o
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
the
barrel
aging
is
subtle
yet
noticeable
ive
only
had
one
other
barrel
aged
pumpkin
ale
and
it
had
a
bit
more
bourbon
flavor
still
very
recommended
though
o
clearly
in
the
upper
echelon
of
pumpkin
beers
we
can
get
in
the
southland
the
pumking
i
had
last
night
side
by
side
overshadowed
it
but
having
a
bottle
to
myself
i
can
better
assess
its
qualities
a
good
beer
for
sure
if
this
was
10
id
be
ecstatic
but
when
its
pushing
17
for
the
750
it
makes
it
tough
even
when
this
is
so
good
in
its
style
tastes
like
a
very
good
strong
ale
but
then
on
finish
has
the
delightful
pumpkin
pie
flavor
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
pumpkin
along
with
the
belgian
like
finish
i
thought
everything
worked
together
well
pours
a
dark
brown
colored
body
very
clear
throughout
head
tops
about
12
with
slowly
disapating
froth
aroma
contains
notes
of
pumpkin
blended
with
the
harvest
spices
all
spice
thats
for
sure
its
a
pretty
solid
barrel
aged
beer
not
a
fan
too
syrupy
not
very
complex
v
good
this
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
slight
bit
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
rich
with
pumpkin
and
spices
the
flavor
has
lots
pumpkin
too
it
and
not
as
much
spices
as
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
believe
the
flavor
is
decently
boozy
and
sweet
there
are
a
few
spices
that
linger
in
the
after
taste
interesting
and
not
like
many
other
pumpkin
beers
on
the
market
most
definitely
a
onebottle
endeavor
or
something
to
be
shared
with
friends
as
its
very
rich
very
heavy
and
yet
rather
irresistible
especially
if
fall
or
harvest
type
of
ales
are
your
thing
o
this
one
seemed
a
bit
unbalanced
and
drank
more
like
a
spiced
cider
than
a
pumpkin
ale
middle
of
the
pack
in
terms
of
pumpkin
ales
a
pumpkin
ale
thats
actually
tasty
definitely
an
exception
to
the
usual
this
is
not
so
spiced
that
gagging
is
required
nor
is
there
so
much
pumpkin
that
you
hesitate
to
swallow
in
fact
i
cant
taste
any
pumpkin
at
all
just
nutmeg
thats
a
good
thing
best
pumpkin
beer
out
there
no
surprise
its
great
definitely
top
tier
of
pumpkin
beers
eh
it
aint
pumking
or
williamsburg
alewerks
pumpkin
quite
a
few
i
would
rate
better
definitely
has
a
strong
pumpkin
taste
but
the
after
taste
of
coffee
like
a
stout
is
odd
like
a
stale
pumpkin
pie
not
crisp
or
smooth
just
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
sort
of
like
that
prom
date
you
were
stoked
to
get
and
then
decided
she
isnt
all
that
like
driving
an
80s
mustang
gt
noise
without
performance
750ml
bottle
on
the
sweeter
side
slightly
cloying
but
a
very
good
beer
i
can
see
people
really
not
liking
this
because
of
the
heavy
ginger
but
i
like
it
less
sweetness
would
be
great
as
a
hoppin
frog
devotee
and
pumpkin
ale
skeptic
i
approached
this
brew
cautiously
optimistic
or
was
i
optimistically
cautious
whatever
its
a
good
beer
hoppin
frog
frogs
hollow
pours
a
deeper
shade
of
orange
than
other
examples
of
the
style
ive
recently
had
head
vanishes
almost
instantly
very
sweet
on
the
nose
this
worries
me
i
like
sweet
beers
but
pumpkin
ales
overdo
it
sometimes
it
smells
vaguely
pumpkin
pieish
with
plenty
of
sugar
and
spice
and
all
that
its
sweet
on
the
palate
but
not
cloyingly
so
pumpkins
up
front
followed
by
an
array
of
spices
and
a
sweet
vanilla
finish
you
know
something
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
o
i
wasnt
in
the
mood
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
i
had
to
get
rid
of
it
it
turned
into
a
delightful
treat
i
was
surprised
at
how
flavorful
it
was
plus
the
mouthfeel
was
good
i
hate
pumpkin
beers
that
are
watery
im
not
all
that
impressed
with
this
its
not
bad
but
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
some
foam
at
first
and
then
it
vanished
with
no
lace
either
color
is
a
nice
clear
medium
amber
with
some
bubble
trails
aroma
is
the
best
part
with
a
nice
blend
of
spice
pumpkin
and
caramel
flavors
a
lot
like
nose
a
little
tang
come
thru
tho
not
much
there
is
enough
bitter
to
balance
body
is
good
carbonation
a
touch
soft
finish
is
like
flavor
tapers
nicely
and
has
a
little
alcohol
warmth
a
bit
of
a
meh
beer
alcohol
by
volume
isnt
really
noticeable
i
would
have
this
for
a
session
overall
i
am
pleased
with
this
beer
and
would
purchase
again
o
this
will
probably
be
one
of
my
last
pumpkins
of
the
season
and
its
a
very
enjoyable
one
to
go
out
on
ill
have
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
next
year
medium
bodied
with
below
average
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
pumpkin
ale
but
not
complex
and
not
as
good
as
the
best
pumpkin
ales
overall
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
and
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
tried
the
burst
of
pumpkin
and
bit
of
crust
in
the
front
is
really
wonderful
a
really
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
o
a
sophisticated
richer
take
on
the
pumpkins
thats
quite
tasty
while
it
features
the
pumpkin
in
the
taste
theres
still
plenty
of
spices
to
be
found
bouncing
around
in
the
mouth
after
the
finish
this
would
be
a
great
alternative
at
the
thanksgiving
table
to
compliment
turkey
and
stuffing
a
meal
thats
always
been
challenging
to
pair
wine
to
d
a
rock
solid
pumpkin
ale
that
deserves
its
place
in
the
top
tier
of
the
style
a
slightly
subpar
appearance
is
quickly
erased
by
the
impact
of
the
nose
mouthfeel
and
especially
the
stellar
flavor
and
taste
highly
recommended
to
lovers
of
the
style
the
8
4
abv
is
fairly
well
hidden
this
is
just
a
smooth
balanced
tasty
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
again
and
happily
recommend
to
others

overall
this

brew
that
hits
the
spot
when
you
want
a
pumpkin
beer
o
a
decent
beer
was
a
little
worried
to
see
a
beer
with
no
head
but
the
smell
of
it
with
its
drinkability
was
enough
to
save
this
one
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
offered
medium
bodied
notes
this
beer
won
a
gold
medal
at
the
2010
gabf
very
good
brew
here
love
the
style
and
a
double
pumpkin
is
even
better
a
solid
bottle
to
seek
out
good
stuff
o
overall
its
an
alright
beer
but
it
doesnt
make
me
think
of
pumpkin
pie
which
i
think
is
the
ultimate
reason
most
people
drink
these
beers
if
youre
looking
for
a
higher
alcohol
version
of
a
pumpkin
beer
it
is
something
to
look
at
if
youre
a
fan
of
ginger
beers
it
is
certainly
something
to
look
at
in
fact
i
would
put
it
at
the
forefront
of
my
recommendations
to
you
if
youre
looking
for
that
traditional
pumpkin
pie
experience
or
you
are
particular
about
carbonation
levels
i
would
say
look
elsewhere
aside
from
this
the
beer
does
fill
that
spiced
holiday
beer
niche
if
youre
just
looking
for
something
different
or
seasonal
you
could
do
worse
overall
i
really
really
like
pumpkin
ales
especially
imperial
pumpkins
i
did
like
this
one
it
has
the
usual
flavors
i
would
expect
from
this
type
of
beer
and
it
was
fairly
easy
to
drink
at
8
4
definitely
worth
a
try
that
being
said
if
the
chips
are
down
i
would
grab
a
southern
tier
pumpking
dogfish
head
punkin
ale
or
a
weyerbacher
pumpkin
before
i
would
grab
one
of
these
cheers
o
a
pretty
spiced
pumpkin
beer
and
a
bit
boozy
i
like
it
but
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
this
year
albeit
a
little
late
overall
a
great
pumpkin
ale
my
second
beer
from
hopping
frog
and
i
was
not
disappointed
thin
head
on
a
hazy
copper
with
golden
hue
body
aroma
of
brown
sugar
spices
and
pumpkin
fresh
pumpkin
pumpkin
pie
no
booze
really
light
brown
sugar
flavors
hitch
are
very
clean
not
too
sweet
or
sour
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
pretty
standard
but
many
if
these
go
overboard
with
the
sour
fresh
pumpkin
flavor
but
this
one
is
balanced
well
with
pumpkin
pie
sweetness
o
a
great
pumpkin
beer
flavorful
yet
incredibly
drinkable
id
buy
it
again
if
it
were
less
expensive
that
or
i
might
try
the
barrelaged
version
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
mediumlight
levels
of
carbonation
the
result
is
a
surprisingly
light
body
for
a
double
ale
fairly
smoothflowing
and
marginally
crisp
closes
semidry
with
modest
stickiness
remaining
across
the
palate
somewhat
disappointing
was
expecting
a
bigger
body
on
this
beer
while
the
one
i
found
was
more
appropriate
to
a
single
pumpkin
ale
d
im
not
a
big
pumpkin
beer
guy
but
this
is
a
particularly
average
one
while
i
appreciate
that
it
isnt
overspiced
the
lack
of
malt
depth
and
outofplace
booziness
is
a
turn
off
i
wouldnt
bother
with
this
one
again
in
the
future
o
with
more
great
pumpkins
no
pun
being
brewed
every
year
there
really
is
no
reason
to
try
this
one
again
it
is
ok
if
i
had
it
in
a
bar
i
would
probably
feel
that
it
is
a
decent
effort
but
when
you
put
this
next
to
a
smashed
pumpkin
or
the
superb
unita
oak
jacked
this
falls
way
flat
liked
it
tastes
nice
not
overwhelming
on
the
spices
so
the
pumpkin
is
the
star
for
a
change
very
pretty
in
the
glass
nice
head
orange
body
much
lacing
the
spices
are
supporting
actors
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
profiles
even
maybe
a
little
kick
of
ginger
in
there
thats
nice
better
than
others
that
are
just
jacked
up
on
the
pie
spice
mix
taste
overall
was
cleaner
and
more
crisp
versus
heavy
and
syrupy
besides
the
label
is
so
cool
worth
having
just
for
that
wife
and
i
thought
it
different
versus
the
herd
of
pumpkin
seasonal
brews
and
we
tried
a
raft
of
them
and
different
in
a
good
way
pours
a
clean
orangeish
color
with
a
small
off
white
to
no
head
in
the
aroma
a
mixed
bag
of
spices
and
some
mellow
pumpkin
in
the
taste
a
mixed
bag
of
spices
but
none
that
stand
out
more
than
the
other
and
a
touch
fruity
especially
banana
a
spice
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
spice
and
banana
peel
in
the
aftertaste
spicy
but
not
defined
the
banana
thing
kind
of
throws
me
just
about
average
o
as
far
as
hoppin
frog
this
one
let
me
down
sorry
folks
overall
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
that
is
probably
a
bit
overpriced
for
the
quality
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
too
watery
and
more
viscosity
wouldnt
hurt
if
this
were
78
a
bomber
it
would
easily
be
one
of
the
best
seasonals
on
the
shelf
regardless
its
still
above
average
and
in
my
top
5
pumpkin
ales
i
would
love
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
of
this
overall
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
one
worth
seeking
out
if
you
enjoy
the
style
pours
a
bright
copper
with
a
finger
of
head
some
of
which
sticks
around
for
some
time
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
contains
both
pumpkin
and
pie
spices
pumpkin
flavor
is
also
quite
apparent
upfront
intermingling
with
the
pumpkin
flavors
is
a
subtle
sweetness
that
almost
tastes
like
honey
graham
crackers
the
finish
has
a
touch
of
alcohol
and
becomes
a
touch
too
astringent
as
time
goes
on
the
booziness
increased
and
made
it
a
tad
difficult
to
finish
the
bottle
on
my
own
but
i
prevailed
in
the
end
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
small
snifter
tiny
bubbles
frothy
light
beige
head
atop
a
light
ambercopper
body
aroma
is
malty
sweet
with
some
sweet
spicing
also
some
mild
pumpkin
rind
some
pulp
and
some
brown
sugary
sweetness
taste
is
lightly
spicy
nice
pumpkin
pie
crust
sort
of
toes
the
line
between
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
pie
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
very
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
out
there
im
not
saying
that
its
better
than
pumking
but
great
a
big
bold
pumpkin
beer
perhaps
not
the
most
unique
in
terms
of
flavor
but
its
also
one
of
the
least
offensive
big
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
it
pours
clear
bright
bright
orange
moreso
than
any
other
pumpkin
beer
ive
imbibed
couple
inches
of
white
head
on
top
but
it
fades
fast
the
nose
features
some
allspice
and
fresh
ginger
a
tad
lighter
on
the
cinnamon
than
most
dont
smell
the
pumpkin
at
all
pumpkin
comes
in
the
flavor
sweeter
and
roasty
brown
sugary
buttery
its
fall
in
a
glass
thats
for
sure
but
the
alcohol
strength
stands
out
pretty
heavily
i
enjoyed
the
aftertaste
of
this
where
the
spices
continue
to
evolve
mouthfeel
is
a
little
undercarbonated
i
think
but
on
the
whole
feels
about
right
for
what
it
is
a
little
overpriced
too
at
11
bucks
a
bomber
but
its
a
tasty
fall
beer
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
brew
the
flavor
profile
is
solid
but
perhaps
they
could
easy
up
a
bit
on
the
cinnamon
and
go
with
more
pumpkin
nuances
also
the
body
could
use
some
thickening
all
and
all
not
bad
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
sampler
glass
one
gets
a
get
shot
of
cinnamon
in
the
aroma
the
appearnce
was
a
golden
color
with
an
off
white
head
without
being
overdramatic
this
is
the
worst
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
at
first
it
reminded
me
of
the
little
cinnamon
hearts
at
grade
school
valentines
day
parties
then
i
further
though
those
hot
dose
of
cinnamon
reminded
me
of
hot
dam
nobody
drinks
that
stuff
straight
and
nobody
should
put
it
in
my
beer
when
it
came
to
the
aftertaste
it
got
the
burn
of
cinnamon
mouthwash
yielding
to
a
more
mediciney
flavor
at
least
the
beer
was
thin
and
the
taste
did
not
last
long
did
i
get
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
in
my
bottle
pumpkin
and
clove
and
the
other
things
people
found
were
nonexistant
as
far
as
im
concerned
lightly
hazy
orangeamber
colour
ring
of
white
head
light
lace
as
well
smell
is
of
cinnamon
candy
or
big
red
gum
initially
nutmeg
ginger
bits
of
pumpkin
and
a
nice
bready
malt
note
as
well
taste
is
cinnamon
up
front
followed
by
citrus
and
fruit
a
really
nice
malt
presence
ginger
and
nutmeg
bits
of
pumpkin
but
for
the
most
part
is
fairly
subtle
medium
carbonation
medium
feel
a
nice
spicy
pumpkin
beer
something
meant
to
be
shared
for
sure
though
d
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
as
i
have
said
a
few
times
with
pumpkin
beers
solid
spice
character
dominates
the
palate
pretty
solid
though
theres
enough
malt
to
balance
things
out
and
provide
a
reallys
olid
backbone
to
all
this
spice
o
not
a
must
have
pumpkin
ale
this
one
just
seems
like
it
does
not
fit
in
with
the
other
imperial
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
it
is
good
just
not
great
overall
i
am
not
too
impressed
im
almost
wondering
if
something
isnt
wrong
with
my
bottle
as
there
is
literally
no
carbonation
a
little
more
mouthfeel
would
have
really
helped
this
out
o
im
a
big
proponent
of
pumpkin
beers
especially
in
fall
when
very
little
stands
in
between
me
and
trying
every
one
i
can
get
my
hands
on
but
i
find
the
money
i
spend
on
this
bottle
quite
regrettable
frogs
hollow
double
pumpkin
ale
seemingly
takes
a
good
pumpkin
beer
recipe
and
doubles
the
malt
with
out
following
suit
with
pumpkin
spice
and
hops
overly
sweet
rich
with
unnecessary
alcohol
and
completely
lacking
in
the
core
essence
of
this
beer
as
outlined
by
the
name
double
pumpkin
wheres
the
pumpkin
in
the
end
i
cant
bring
myself
to
label
this
beer
as
offensive
but
if
its
a
true
double
pumpkin
youre
looking
for
reach
for
pumking
and
save
yourself
some
money
in
the
process
overall
a
flavorful
pumpkin
treat
i
love
the
depth
and
richness
of
this
one
this
one
jumps
out
as
one
of
the
more
complex
pumpkin
brews
along
the
lines
of
southern
tiers
pumpking
although
i
think
i
prefer
st
i
would
get
this
again
if
i
wanted
a
nice
pumpkin
sipper
orange
with
some
redder
highlights
ring
of
retention
and
light
lacing
nose
of
hot
tamales
candy
light
ginger
sweet
malt
and
light
pumpkin
some
citrus
perhaps
very
perfumey
taste
of
sweet
pumpkin
spicing
more
in
cinnamon
and
ginger
light
clove
and
sweet
malt
full
feel
but
not
syrupy
lower
carbonation
and
not
overly
sweet
a
really
good
spiced
beer
pumpkin
is
subtle
very
nice
stuff
oda
pretty
good
pump
beer
not
the
best
i
have
had
this
season
a
little
less
complex
than
pumpking
but
it
holds
up
with
the
better
offerings
of
the
style
quite
nice
not
must
have
not
bitter
for
its
alcohol
content
overall
good
beer
that
i
will
not
hesitate
to
drink
again
not
overly
sweet
pours
straight
orange
clear
very
nice
but
lacks
any
head
to
speak
of
theres
no
retention
and
no
lacing
so
a
little
disappointed
with
the
appearance
smell
is
toffee
buttery
crackers
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
taste
is
fantastic
sweetness
initially
which
fades
into
flavor
buttery
cracker
crust
pumpkin
nutmeg
allspice
a
bit
of
spice
from
clove
and
ginger
a
little
more
sweetness
squeaks
through
here
and
there
to
add
to
the
complexity
very
nice
delicious
firm
creamy
medium
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
in
a
good
way
in
that
it
lets
you
know
your
drinking
an
imperial
ale
and
not
eating
grandmas
state
fair
blue
ribbon
pumpkin
pie
well
balanced
and
finish
isnt
cloying
at
all
its
sweet
at
times
but
you
wouldnt
describe
frogs
hollow
double
pumpkin
as
sweet
and
thats
what
makes
it
extra
good
and
hence
this
bad
boy
is
right
up
there
and
maybe
surpassing
my
all
time
favorite
pumking
o
the
alcohol
is
this
beer
is
hidden
in
the
taste
but
there
is
a
light
presence
in
the
mouthfeel
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
definitely
not
sessionable
due
to
the
high
abv
i
enjoy
the
fact
that
while
i
pumpkin
beer
it
is
not
overly
sweet
this
beer
smells
and
tastes
very
good
its
maybe
a
little
lite
on
the
body
and
i
would
like
some
hop
presence
so
that
i
know
im
drinking
beer
on
the
other
hand
its
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
o
i
like
this
beer
the
flavors
are
solid
without
being
overthetop
i
look
forward
to
seeing
this
in
the
fall
originally
reviewed
09262011
o
overall
the
beer
is
horrible
if
you
like
drinking
sugar
water
this
is
great
pour
is
transparent
deep
golems
orange
fairly
tight
white
head
the
nose
isnt
overpowering
but
mostly
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
pumpkin
spice
light
hints
of
grain
underneath
taste
has
more
grain
a
light
metallic
note
reduced
spice
light
pepper
spice
body
is
light
high
carb
a
touch
messy
rather
average
frogs
hollow
hey
at
least
it
aint
pumking
i
could
drink
this
every
night
and
be
happy
about
it
ive
had
a
lot
of
fall
seasonals
and
this
is
pretty
much
spot
on
for
halloween
or
thanksgiving
overall
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
brew
imo
thisll
be
on
thanksgiving
table
next
year
doverall
this
was
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
it
had
alright
flavors
but
i
dont
think
everything
came
together
like
they
wanted
it
to
its
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
there
are
tons
out
there
that
our
better
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
but
i
will
reach
for
something
different
next
october
o
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
too
potent
with
the
overly
sweet
notes
o
overall
liked
the
flavor
imperial
spicing
while
the
alcohol
is
hidden
rather
well
behind
the
sweetness
and
spicing
flavor
is
quite
clean
and
very
smooth
in
transition
good
dessert
beer
if
you
like
your
pumpkin
pie
heavily
spiced
then
this
may
be
for
you
while
sometimes
less
is
more
here
an
enthusiastic
load
of
spices
was
simply
way
too
much
actually
overwhelming
nutmeg
allspice
clove
raid
the
spice
cabinet
a
pumpkin
pie
with
this
much
spice
would
be
overdone
and
this
beer
bordered
on
undrinkable
sweet
a
bit
syrupy
malt
with
some
etoh
heat
struggled
on
for
a
while
and
gave
up
very
good
pumpkin
ale
on
the
pricey
side
but
so
is
every
beer
in
dc
good
tasting
beer
here
its
just
not
what
i
would
call
a
pumpkin
first
and
foremost
giving
it
a
rough
ballpark
estimate
the
spice
flavor
is
like
four
or
five
time
as
big
as
the
pumpkin
flavor
this
is
another
pumpkin
beer
lovers
of
the
style
could
make
a
regular
o
there
was
no
love
for
this
one
in
the
tasting
group
i
think
it
was
because
of
the
barrel
aged
stuff
is
totally
different
i
think
its
fun
however
o
a
pretty
decent
pumpkin
ale
id
like
a
bit
less
spice
presence
in
the
flavor
and
more
vanillapumpkin
still
it
smells
quite
good
and
is
pretty
tasty
a
good
but
overpriced
pumpkin
ale
for
these
guys
this
is
a
let
down
give
me
schaflys
any
day
day
can
almost
buy
a
case
for
the
cost
of
two
of
these
bombers
in
other
word
either
these
guys
or
roof
bros
in
paducah
have
hosed
me
o
a
good
pumpkin
brew
quality
pumpkin
ale
typical
spicing
and
all
the
expected
flavor
components
a
bit
of
alcohol
showing
itself
here
and
there
nice
thanksgiving
night
night
capper
aroma
is
topnotch
very
inviting
pumpkin
flavor
and
a
delicate
sweetness
are
noteworthy
and
push
this
beer
up
the
rating
scale
my
only
criticism
is
the
beer
seems
a
bit
watery
and
flat
my
wish
is
that
the
beer
would
have
been
twice
as
strong
flavorwise
increased
costprice
would
be
worth
it
and
that
it
would
form
a
rich
head
in
the
glass
that
would
be
an
a
double
pumpkin
is
a
good
beer
i
enjoyed
this
return
to
the
suds
the
beer
is
better
than
this
review
sounds
but
just
is
really
weird
i
dont
know
a
better
way
to
describe
it
factor
in
a
retail
price
of
12
bucks
a
bomber
and
this
is
a
beer
i
wont
have
again
this
started
off
pretty
good
but
went
downhill
as
it
warmed
the
spices
and
booze
began
to
dominate
and
it
just
never
recovered
i
prefer
more
pumpkin
and
less
spice
in
my
pumpkin
ales
o
excellent
pumpkin
ale
heavy
on
the
pumpkin
but
the
spices
dont
get
completely
overshadowed
either
overall
the
smell
is
great
the
banana
was
a
huge
surprise
for
me
the
taste
had
too
much
alcohol
presence
seemed
to
overpower
the
other
flavors
cheers
o
its
not
bad
i
liked
it
but
i
prefer
others
oextremely
solid
and
tasty
pumpkin
ale
second
best
ive
tasted
behind
schlafly
i
generally
dont
like
pumpkin
beers
but
this
is
the
best
ive
had
of
course
that
only
goes
for
an
aged
bottle
fresh
i
was
less
than
impressed
medium
smooth
oily
body
almost
no
carbonation
pumpkin
alcohol
caramel
and
spices
fill
the
mouth
long
dry
finish
i
expected
much
more
from
this
brew
overall
frogs
hollow
double
pumpkin
ale
seems
to
be
a
little
better
than
most
beers
of
this
style
ideal
for
a
cold
fall
night
tastes
just
like
it
smells
with
a
little
more
cinnamon
in
the
mix
and
a
little
creaminess
to
the
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
a
warming
alcoholic
pumpkin
pie
brew
will
buy
again
next
year
pours
a
golden
orange
with
no
head
none
as
in
little
to
no
carbonation
smells
of
cinnamon
spices
and
a
typical
pumpkin
beer
smell
wasnt
bad
but
the
tasete
here
we
go
overly
sweet
overly
spiced
and
an
unbalanced
mess
comepletely
one
diminsional
throughout
no
body
at
all
and
seemed
way
thin
wouldve
been
a
pour
but
it
was
all
i
had
for
the
day
before
halloween
iam
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
iam
gonna
review
it
now
and
get
another
in
the
futurethis
was
not
very
good
at
all
poured
a
dull
burnt
orange
with
no
head
to
speak
of
at
alljust
looked
flat
heavy
spice
in
the
nose
with
cinnamonand
clove
being
most
prominant
over
mace
and
cardamom
overly
spiced
flavors
with
cinnamon
and
cardamom
being
way
overdone
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beeriam
not
sure
if
its
off
or
really
this
bad
just
sweet
boozy
and
overspiced
i
just
did
a
blind
taste
test
with
8
friends
as
judges
of
19
different
pumpkin
ales
and
hoppin
frog
finished

overall
it
was
interesting
that
the

finishers
had

enjoy
o
i
felt
this
was
probably
the
best
thought
out
pumpkin
brew
ive
had
good
balance
and
tasty
sits
light
with
a
decent
body
it
has
lager
smoothness
with
all
the
spices
of
an
ale
could
use
a
little
sanding
of
the
rough
edges
but
the
base
is
here
ive
had
this
before
and
dont
remember
all
of
the
ginger
if
it
was
a
little
bit
more
balanced
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
i
would
give
this
a
better
score
its
almost
like
any
other
pumpkin
beer
mixed
with
some
ginger
ale
half
and
half
as
it
warms
it
gets
better
but
im
surprised
more
people
arent
getting
this
much
ginger
top
notch
this
is
the
top
beer
of
my
two
favorite
pumpkins
for
11
overall
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
coincidentally
i
probably
like
this
with
age
on
it
ill
have
to
pick
up
a
fresher
one
to
see
how
it
compares
but
this
has
held
up
surprisingly
well
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
in
terms
of
flavor
perhaps
the
most
likely
contender
to
take
on
pumking
ive
tasted
this
year
however
i
still
think
this
one
falls
short
the
flavors
are
intense
but
not
as
balanced
as
they
could
be
not
to
mention
it
got
worse
at
it
warmed
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
pumpkin
beer
lots
of
pie
spice
and
well
balanced
overall
im
not
sure
my
low
score
here
is
as
characteristic
as
i
want
it
to
be
for
what
i
think
about
this
brew
but
as
ive
stated
before
the
missing
carbonation
and
hop
element
could
possibly
end
up
doing
a
lot
for
this
nothing
will
help
the
huge
melange
of
spices
so
if
youre
not
into
that
or
are
afraid
stay
away
but
again
i
feel
like
whether
they
intended
it
or
not
the
girls
who
like
the
spicy
pumpkin
or
holiday
ales
would
really
like
this
otherwise
and
though
i
did
enjoy
this
i
would
maybe
look
elsewhere
also
for
near
10
a
bomber
that
price
point
doesnt
work
for
me
for
what
the
beer
ends
up
being
in
the
end
all
of
this
said
ill
still
continue
to
check
out
more
beers
from
hf
since
i
really
like
what
theyre
doing
from
the
ones
ive
tried
thus
far
that
is
it
pours
the
common
color
of
most
other
pumpkins
with
a
head
to
match
the
others
as
well
however
poorly
sustained
similar
aroma
profile
but
heavy
on
something
theres
one
thing
that
stands
out
as
another
recent
reviewer
put
like
potpurri
but
im
not
likin
it
a
bit
boozy
which
isnt
welcome
here
due
to
other
flavor
flaws
im
looking
forward
to
liking
a
beer
again
from
akron
ohio
dthe
spices
are
once
again
just
too
much
for
me
i
prefer
a
more
subtle
pumpkin
beer
with
less
carbonation
since
the
spices
tend
to
thin
a
beer
out
on
their
own
im
impressed
i
dont
run
into
many
great
pumpkin
ales
any
more
but
this
ones
really
doing
the
trick
again
very
complex
with
some
new
qualities
still
dont
know
if
its
in
the
running
with
pumking
but
its
not
too
far
behind
just
a
very
different
beer
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
12
inch
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
this
one
whatsoever
smell
is
very
spice
forward
with
the
cinnamon
coming
across
as
cinnamon
flavored
gum
i
am
also
getting
some
minor
malt
and
pumpkin
aromas
taste
is
of
cinnamon
gum
right
off
the
bat
followed
by
other
pumpkin
pie
spices
actual
malt
and
pumpkin
flavors
are
very
subdued
overall
this
beer
does
have
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
just
not
a
very
good
beer
all
the
components
are
average
or
above
but
all
together
this
beer
is
too
one
dimensional
with
the
overwhelming
spice
especially
cinnamon
smells
and
tastes
o
considering
its
strength
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
o
the
spices
are
a
bit
stale
and
bland
or
really
overcooked
with
an
odd
vegital
flavor
for
support
i
didnt
get
any
malt
character
out
of
this
i
was
pretty
let
down
and
i
enjoy
pumpkin
beers
this
time
of
year
pours
a
slightly
hazed
orange
copper
with
minimal
white
head
the
nose
is
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
some
clove
the
taste
is
a
cadied
spiced
up
autumn
brew
that
is
perfect
for
this
cool
night
cinnamon
with
pumpkin
spice
and
some
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
some
candy
stickiness
overall
fire
brew
for
the
fall
season
that
really
represents
the
style
well
o
this
doesnt
have
that
fresh
pumpkin
pie
taste
that
i
enjoy
in
my
pumpkin
beers
i
may
see
what
some
time
does
to
my
other
bottle
though
overall
is
it
drinkable
yes
in
fact
the
warming
effect
of
the
alcohol
is
quite
pleasant
on
a
nice
fall
night
which
is
what
beers
of
this
style
are
meant
for
right
if
you
like
the
spices
associated
with
pumpkin
pie
and
are
a
fan
of
the
sweeter
side
of
beer
this
one
is
for
you
o
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
definitely
on
the
spicier
side
of
the
table
o
this
pumpkin
beer
is
unique
in
that
the
spice
profile
is
more
intense
than
ive
experienced
in
other
it
captures
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
well
and
the
alcohol
is
well
integrate
overall
a
highlyenjoyable
very
sessionable
pumpkin
ale
id
hoped
for
a
bit
more
maltiness
and
body
but
overall
i
recommend
you
try
this
one
o
a
very
nice
offering
of
the
style
not
too
many
of
the
pumpkin
beers
i
enjoy
manage
to
get
both
the
meaty
pumpkin
and
the
pumpkin
pie
thing
going
on
in
the
same
beer
well
played
hoppin
frog
well
played
o
very
nicely
done
the
spice
is
there
but
it
isnt
overwhelming
i
had
to
drain
pour
half
of
the
bottle
i
dont
remember
this
being
that
bad
perhaps
it
tasted
better
in
my
earlier
craft
beer
years
or
perhaps
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
this
go
around
im
convinced
i
could
brew
a
better
pumpkin
beer
and
i
have
never
even
attempted
such
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
oa
i
really
liked
this
want
more
havent
found
a
lot
of
pumkins
i
like
this
one
was
over
the
top
stallone
style
overall
not
the
flavor
bomb
i
was
expecting
espically
from
this
brewery
that
features
over
the
top
flavored
beers
rather
smooth
and
dangerous
at
8
4
drinkibilty
wish
it
had
more
pumpkin
flavor
and
a
little
lest
ginger
worth
a
drink
for
sure
just
a
little
weak
from
hoppin
frog
overall
its
okay
but
for
me
its
definitely
not
the
best
from
the
imperial
pumpkin
ale
patch
poured
a
brownishorage
w
a
quicky
dying
fizzy
head
on
top
of
an
intense
pumpkin
aroma
although
i
pick
up
hints
of
sweet
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
but
theyre
overpowered
by
pepper
and
clove
a
real
smooth
and
easy
down
the
hatch
body
lighter
bodied
and
kind
of
slick
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
sipping
pumpkin
beer
as
the
pumpkin
is
strong
and
the
sweetness
is
there
the
spices
and
the
alcohol
narrowly
edge
this
though
as
i
found
sweetness
giving
way
to
a
dry
alkie
burn
and
sharp
pepper
spice
notes
the
finish
is
warming
and
spicey
dry
which
is
appreciated
a
good
pumpkin
ale
but
overall
i
tend
to
like
them
a
tad
sweeter
overall
this
was
a
great
find
great
tasting
pumpkin
ale
with
a
hefty
8
4
abv
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
had
worth
picking
up
for
sho
o
naturally
i
liked
this
beer
and
recommend
you
try
it
the
sweetness
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
flavors
is
secondary
to
the
savory
vegetal
aspects
of
pumpkin
this
is
a
full
course
ale
personally
for
a
pumpkin
ale
i
tend
to
prefer
something
either
a
little
sweeter
like
southern
tiers
pumking
a
little
more
distinguished
like
dogfish
heads
punkin
or
a
little
brighter
like
shipyards
smashed
pumpkin
but
depending
on
your
tastes
this
may
be
precisely
your
pint
of
ale
only
one
way
to
find
out
eh
overall
the
more
pumpkin
beers
i
have
the
more
discriminating
i
become
this
tastes
good
but
its
just
a
cinnamon
and
clove
beer
i
want
some
pumpkin
overall
its
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
flavorful
and
enjoyable
however
i
wouldnt
put
it
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
favorite
pumpkins
tried
as
part
of
a
pumpkin
ale
tasting
and
it
generally
ranked
among
the
middle
of
the
pack
behind
the
likes
of
pumking
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
and
punkin
probably
the
most
unique
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
very
flavorful
and
enjoyable
if
you
like
ginger
and
cloves
but
a
bit
on
the
potent
side
worth
trying
for
sure
but
may
not
be
a
return
beer
for
some
my
first
foray
into
the
world
of
hoppin
frog
was
a
bit
disappointing
bought
a
22
oz
bomber
along
with
a
bunch
of
other
fall
beers
and
kept
it
aside
to
taste
on
its
own
shared
it
with
a
buddy
poured
into
8
oz
tulip
glasses
a
beautiful
burnt
orange
color
and
great
smells
of
clove
and
nutmeg
but
wheres
the
carbonation
no
head
no
lacing
the
taste
is
strongly
clove
with
other
spices
and
pumpkin
in
the
background
but
the
sweetness
lingers
and
becomes
cloying
with
good
carbonation
to
scrub
the
tongue
theres
a
good
alcohol
presence
that
made
me
check
the
bottle
to
see
if
it
was
barrel
aged
but
again
the
sweetness
is
overwhelming
without
carbonation
overall
interesting
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
this
season
kind
of
made
me
want
a
whiskey
overall
i
liked
the
beer
a
lot
smell
was
everything
you
would
want
from
a
pumpkin
beer
taste
gets
a
little
time
to
warm
up
to
but
when
it
does
its
one
of
the
better
of
the
style
pours
an
orange
clear
color
with
no
head
upon
drinking
no
lacing
is
present
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
nutmeg
cinnomon
and
pumpkin
it
is
an
inviting
aroma
but
weaker
than
most
the
tatse
has
a
pumpkim
backbone
with
the
flavors
of
nutmeg
cinnomon
and
a
little
breadiness
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
overall
it
was
a
mid
pack
pumpkin
beer
the
taste
and
aroma
were
okay
but
not
top
of
the
class
a
little
stronger
taste
would
help
o
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
worth
checking
out
i
like
pumpkin
ales
and
i
like
hoppin
frog
but
my
main
drawback
is
the
aftertaste
which
is
a
little
watery
for
my
liking
and
the
spices
could
be
dialed
up
a
bit
o
a
good
pumpkin
beer
not
my
favorite
but
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
a
very
good
mix
between
spice
and
sweetness
it
also
masks
the
decently
high
alcohol
content
well
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberorange
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
an
excellent
pumpkin
scent
along
with
complimentary
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spices
the
malt
bill
provides
adequate
depth
and
complexity
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
pale
and
crystal
malt
flavor
along
with
nice
pumpkin
character
the
spicing
is
adequate
and
rounds
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
low
to
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
seasonal
thats
bold
yet
accessible
to
the
casual
pumpkin
beer
drinker
i
like
pumpkin
beers
and
i
like
hoppin
frog
brews
usually
but
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
at
all
way
overpowering
in
the
spice
department
while
being
watery
and
one
dimensional
pass
o
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
not
too
overpowering
and
a
nice
flavor
expectations
high
as
this
was
a
gold
medal
winner
at
the
2010
gabf
field
beer
category
pour
is
disappointing
honestly
a
tiny
fizz
of
head
gives
way
to
nothing
in
less
than
a
minute
the
good
thing
is
and
this
is
what
keeps
it
at
an
average
score
is
that
the
color
is
a
beautiful
goldenorange
the
light
really
plays
around
and
i
see
a
few
carb
trails
so
strange
that
it
has
no
head
ah
but
the
smell
is
where
things
get
good
at
first
whiff
nothing
more
than
a
wellcrafted
spicy
pumpkin
pie
comes
to
mind
seriously
it
is
a
ringer
the
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
play
a
part
here
as
i
drink
more
the
feel
of
the
clove
and
definitely
the
ginger
come
out
with
gobs
of
pumpkin
finishes
sharply
a
pumpkin
laser
of
saturation
the
8
4
is
masked
well
a
delicious
pumpkin
beer
overall
i
came
in
with
fairly
low
expectations
and
was
fairly
surprised
certainly
i
could
only
drink
these
every
once
in
a
while
the
early
onset
of
fall
seems
like
a
good
enough
time
i
have
to
admit
a
bias
toward
this
brewery
in
general
and
also
to
pumpkin
ales
as
a
style
this
is
a
solid
example
though
not
my
favorite
id
say
its
a
little
spicier
than
id
like
but
still
good
not
as
sweet
as
some
others
which
is
a
plus
in
this
case
overall
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
enjoyed
during
an
impromptu
pumpkin
tasting
orangey
amber
hue
scent
is
a
punch
of
nutmeg
and
kiss
of
pumpkin
taste
is
more
subtle
but
extremely
enjoyable
hint
of
alcohol
smiley
face
on
the
note
pad
have
to
stock
up
on
this
one
as
we
have
a
few
moons
till
thanksgiving
o
solid
and
enjoyable
22
ounce
serving
with
a
big
deep
orange
copper
body
representing
the
hoppin
frog
out
of
akron
ohio
aroma
hits
you
in
the
face
with
clove
and
other
aromatics
in
the
way
of
ginger
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
classic
pumpkin
pie
spices
with
some
meaty
juicy
pumpkin
gourds
going
on
as
well
really
well
balanced
between
loads
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
sweet
caramel
candy
pumpkin
fruit
sugars
pretty
amazing
feet
to
spice
it
so
heavily
with
a
beer
with
this
much
spice
character
to
not
come
off
cloying
almost
a
toasted
marshmallow
like
experience
full
of
roasted
caramel
this
beer
is
pretty
awesome
even
if
you
dont
like
pumpkin
pie
its
actually
easier
to
drink
than
alot
of
other
imperial
pumpkin
ales
out
there
but
just
super
spicy
im
givnig
my
second
half
to
my
wife
and
i
will
cleanse
the
palate
and
start
in
on
a
fresh
six
of
green
flash
wcipa
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
that
should
probably
be
served
in
12
ounce
portions
but
its
still
a
good
version
of
a
widely
abused
style
22oz
bomber
pours
a
deep
orange
color
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
cinnamon
allspice
nutmeg
and
some
real
pumpkin
smell
as
well
in
the
taste
a
solid
layer
of
the
pumpkin
pie
spice
with
pumpkin
flavor
in
the
background
a
touch
of
vanilla
but
mostly
a
dry
spicy
flavor
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
crisp
with
a
lingering
spice
overall
a
nice
imperial
pumpkin
ale
if
you
like
a
well
spiced
pumpkin
pie
this
beer
is
for
you
overall
a
very
delicious
pumpkin
ale
overall
the
sweetness
and
allspice
notes
are
nice
and
theres
a
weird
earthiness
as
well
that
is
a
bit
unique
and
interesting
overall
however
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
christmas
ale
than
anything
else
id
be
interested
to
try
this
fresh
and
see
what
its
like
overall
again
this
is
probably
the
most
pumpkin
pie
beer
ive
had
and
nothing
was
too
overpowering
however
i
did
feel
as
if
it
were
just
a
little
too
sweet
i
was
thankful
to
have
a
friend
to
share
this
bomber
with
because
it
had
a
lot
of
sweetness
to
it
a
very
tasty
brew
my
first
pumpkin
beer
of
this
season
right
on
it
pours
a
clear
ambertawn
topped
by
a
finger
of
creamtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
cinnamon
brown
sugar
nutmeg
light
clove
bread
pumpkin
seeds
and
caramel
the
taste
seems
to
accentuate
the
spices
blending
them
all
nicely
together
in
a
buttery
caramel
shell
then
an
equally
strong
blast
of
pure
pumpkin
comes
in
balancing
out
the
spices
and
showing
that
this
beers
name
is
more
than
appropriate
damn
does
this
taste
good
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
creamy
feel
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
other
than
treat
but
i
dont
really
put
that
in
the
pumpkin
beer
category
get
some
o
frogs
hollow
is
another
solid
beer
by
hoppin
frog
tilts
toward
the
spicysweet
side
of
the
pumpkin
style
but
the
flavors
were
balanced
and
well
integrated
definitely
had
a
prominent
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
as
well
if
it
werent
for
slightly
lackluster
carbonation
this
would
have
gotten
a
better
review
from
me
as
it
is
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
pumpkins
i
have
had
ill
definitely
revisit
though
mouth
feel
and
overall
the
strong
mixture
of
spices
blends
well
with
vanilla
and
pumpkin
the
spice
thankfully
does
not
overpower
the
gourd
notes
this
is
a
welcoming
change
to
some
of
the
overspiced
brews
ive
been
experiencing
mediumbodied
sweet
in
all
the
right
ways
like
pumpkin
pie
i
will
definitely
be
stocking
my
fridge
with
this
brew
until
the
snow
covers
the
streets
the
typical
pumpkin
ale
richness
that
i
enjoy
is
missing
here
and
flavors
seemed
to
fade
some
on
the
finish
for
a
pumpkin
ale
this
one
was
just
okay
as
compared
to
others
ive
had
pours
a
lovely
burnt
orange
color
with
a
sadly
disappointing
lack
of
head
only
splotchy
offwhite
clumps
scent
is
fantastic
strong
notes
of
pumpkin
pie
light
vanilla
and
cream
grahmn
crackery
malts
with
heavy
seasonal
spicing
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
taste
leans
heavily
on
the
pie
spices
almost
overbearing
by
the
time
a
22oz
bomber
is
ingested
blended
the
last
8oz
or
so
with
other
beers
to
experiment
all
notes
from
scent
are
present
just
take
a
back
seat
to
spice
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
extra
creamy
but
a
looong
lingering
aftertaste
kicks
the
rating
down
a
notch
overall
this
beer
needs
a
a
little
work
a
touch
less
spice
could
go
a
long
way
pours
a
lovely
orangeamber
color
practically
pumpkin
colored
with
practically
no
head
the
smell
is
of
definite
pumpkin
pie
spices
with
cinnamon
and
ginger
with
hints
of
nutmeg
a
classic
blend
the
taste
matches
the
smell
pretty
much
giving
it
a
classic
pumpkin
pie
taste
the
flavor
is
well
rounded
with
a
smoother
alcohol
finish
the
overall
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
but
still
coats
the
mouth
with
flavors
and
the
higher
abv
isnt
overly
noticeable
either
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
tasty
but
not
cloying
pumpkin
beer
its
very
well
spiced
and
avoids
the
trap
of
being
a
one
note
drink
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
smooth
and
the
flavor
is
very
nice
overall
i
think
it
is
a
very
nice
pumpkin
beer
and
i
could
definitely
see
myself
at
thanksgiving
dinner
with
a
bottle
of
this
also
the
more
i
am
drinking
this
i
am
realizing
that
i
am
glad
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
if
it
were
any
thicker
it
would
be
too
much
by
the
end
anyways
i
think
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
and
i
would
buy
it
again
the
aroma
was
about
as
rich
in
pumpkin
spice
as
you
could
possibly
get
huge
notes
of
spices
that
just
come
whiffing
up
to
the
surface
this
was
an
enormously
good
smelling
beer
i
swear
if
you
could
bottle
the
fall
season
it
would
come
close
to
this
i
am
sure
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
rich
in
every
sense
of
the
word
huge
notes
here
of
all
spice
pumpkin
and
hints
of
earthy
grains
tingling
the
tongue
as
it
went
down
it
was
like
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
which
is
about
all
that
can
be
said
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
golden
copper
color
almost
has
a
little
amber
tone
as
well
the
head
was
nice
and
left
a
good
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
spicy
lots
of
clove
and
some
other
autumn
spices
coming
off
of
it
the
taste
was
nearly
all
clove
to
me
i
wasnt
able
to
get
much
pumpkin
at
all
from
this
brew
the
flavors
just
didnt
seem
balanced
in
this
one
for
me
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
the
overall
on
this
brew
is
that
there
seemed
to
be
too
much
of
one
spice
coming
through
which
hindered
my
thoughts
on
this
brew
d
first
taste
of
a
pumpkin
beer
wasnt
thinking
it
would
be
that
close
though
the
aroma
was
amazing
really
thought
you
had
a
pie
in
front
of
you
very
nicely
done
wish
we
would
have
had
a
2nd
bottle
to
open
up
for
sure
o
this
one
is
a
bit
much
for
a
bomber
i
had
trouble
finishing
a
full
glass
glad
i
split
it
overall
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
really
on
par
with
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
which
i
believe
it
the
best
pumpkin
ale
on
the
planet
this
is
in
the
top
echelon
as
far
as
flavor
goes
in
the
pumpkin
beer
category
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
highly
recommended
o
ive
had
this
one
sitting
in
my
cellar
for
a
few
months
and
it
has
really
helped
this
beer
i
was
initially
dissapointed
with
it
back
in
october
but
a
lot
of
that
brash
spicing
has
given
way
to
a
really
mellow
and
smooth
pumpkin
ale
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
next
year
but
wont
roll
my
eyes
if
you
or
someone
else
decide
to
served
in
a
celebrator
stemmed
glass
tumbler
the
beer
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
color
with
a
small
foamy
offwhite
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
not
much
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
very
strong
and
spicy
mostly
like
cinnamon
and
cloves
but
with
some
nutmeg
ginger
and
pumpkin
noticeable
too
reminded
me
of
a
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
i
can
taste
all
the
spices
and
pumpkin
the
finish
was
very
long
and
nice
and
spicy
fairly
full
bodied
and
smooth
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
i
think
this
is
has
moved
into
my
top
3
favorite
pumpkin
ales
na
zdravje
nice
beer
doesnt
knock
pumking
or
dfh
punkin
off
the
top
two
spots
for
me
but
nice
none
the
less
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
i
remember
liking
this
a
lot
more
on
tap
at
gabf
at
that
point
it
was
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
if
its
just
better
on
tap
or
if
i
had
a
few
too
many
at
gabf
by
that
point
but
this
is
just
ok
its
a
bit
flat
and
overly
sweet
with
some
off
notes
d
the
drinkability
was
decent
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
from
this
style
of
beer
period
hoppin
frogs
was
good
but
i
liked
southern
tiers
better
almost
no
head
and
the
fluid
is
cloudy
darkyellow
pumpkin
all
a
round
with
some
cinnamon
and
ginger
this
is
a
very
fruity
beer
and
i
liked
every
sip
of
it
never
had
a
pumpkin
ale
but
i
liked
this
one
a
great
representation
for
the
style
up
there
with
the
greats
of
this
style
very
pleasing
and
would
try
again
next
season
to
see
if
the
recipe
changes
would
like
more
pumpkin
less
spice
or
maybe
even
a
vanilla
pinch
to
throttle
down
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
this
is
one
and
done
for
me
but
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
like
imperial
pumpkin
ales
its
got
all
the
spices
and
pumpkin
you
could
ask
for
d
really
good
drinkability
uh
not
the
best
its
too
sweet
and
oddly
tart
for
my
liking
i
need
a
bit
of
pumpkin
in
the
flavor
to
balance
all
those
spices
not
sure
about
that
tartness
though
im
thinking
maybe
its
an
over
abundance
of
ginger
but
its
weird
and
not
really
proper
for
a
pumpkin
beer
the
only
real
strength
of
the
beer
is
the
fact
that
its
damn
near
8
5
and
i
dont
get
a
touch
of
booze
thanks
very
much
for
the
opportunity
bobby
strong
aroma
has
a
strong
spicy
overtone
mainly
cinnamon
with
pumpkin
and
subtle
malty
tones
as
well
it
pours
a
pretty
clear
amber
with
a
thick
fluffy
fairly
persistent
white
head
flavor
is
malty
and
spicy
with
a
nice
pumpkinpie
overtone
and
a
hint
of
caramel
texture
is
rather
fizzy
leaving
a
spicy
finish
and
a
tingle
that
hangs
around
for
a
little
bit
this
is
an
excellent
autumn
beer
perfect
for
halloween
or
thanksgiving
overall
a
great
pumpkin
beer
honestly
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
hoppin
frog
but
very
solid
all
around
thought
this
would
be
bigger
its
huge
on
taste
but
the
body
is
kept
small
enough
that
its
a
drinker
vs
a
sipper
well
done
hoppin
frog
and
at
a
fair
price
point
somewhat
dry
finish
no
alcohol
present
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
and
spiced
drinkability
good
hoppin
frogs
hollow
double
pumpkin
found
this
guy
in
a
bomber
about
a
week
ago
ive
recently
gotten
into
pumpkin
beers
after
shying
away
from
them
for
a
number
of
years
theyre
an
acquired
taste
to
be
certain
but
they
can
be
quite
tasty
if
you
know
what
youre
getting
into
first
thing
i
notice
when
pouring
the
beer
is
the
clarity
brewing
with
pumpkin
you
would
expect
it
to
be
cloudy
but
thats
not
the
case
color
is
a
crystal
clear
orange
its
a
pumpkin
beer
what
did
you
expect
fizzy
head
that
recedes
quickly
aroma
is
nutmeg
allspice
pumpkin
and
maybe
some
cinnamon
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
more
bready
and
caramel
like
pie
crust
chased
by
a
heavy
dose
of
more
nutmeg
allspice
clove
and
cinnamon
first
taste
and
the
pumpkin
flavor
kind
of
gets
lost
behind
a
heavy
wall
of
spice
lots
of
alcohol
warm
in
the
finish
which
works
given
the
taste
profile
for
something
that
calls
itself
a
double
pumpkin
i
find
that
particular
flavor
getting
lost
which
is
too
bad
because
thats
my
favorite
part
of
this
style
of
beer
for
an
imperial
i
find
that
this
lacks
body
as
its
kind
of
watery
which
is
also
somewhat
disappointing
overall
its
a
nice
take
on
the
style
but
nothing
earth
shattering
somewhat
disappointed
by
this
though
that
may
be
because
ive
had
some
exemplary
versions
of
this
style
in
the
past
beer
is
light
to
medium
in
body
pumpkin
comes
through
its
pretty
spicy
with
allspice
and
nutmeg
but
its
not
overwelming
like
i
had
feared
from
the
aroma
its
pretty
nice
i
think
the
warming
effect
of
the
alcohol
is
helping
this
beer
a
lot
its
a
decent
beer
and
id
expect
nothing
less
from
hoppin
frog
pretty
good
overall
recommended
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
i
like
it
because
it
is
rather
unique
when
compared
to
other
pumpkin
ales
out
there
its
no
st
pumking
but
i
would
def
drink
this
again
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
fairly
slight
head
smells
somewhat
sweet
and
toasty
less
like
pumpkin
than
pumpkin
pie
spices
there
is
also
a
nuttiness
like
toasted
pumpkin
seeds
and
a
bit
of
waxiness
the
taste
is
has
more
of
that
nuttiness
and
less
spice
still
not
a
lot
of
true
pumpkin
but
overall
its
less
sweet
than
the
smell
there
is
an
interesting
finish
that
develops
some
light
cocoa
flavorsand
then
a
touch
of
mint
at
the
end
definitely
a
bit
different
while
still
being
somewhat
subtle
smooth
somewhat
nutty
which
lends
some
creaminess
and
only
moderately
sweet
in
the
mouth
pretty
good
a
little
different
profile
but
not
a
lot
of
real
pumpkin
flavor
drinkability
this
one
is
a
let
down
the
most
expensive
of
three
i
recently
bought
pumking
and
weyerbachers
were
the
others
and
the
worst
its
too
boozy
tasting
too
flat
and
not
malty
tasting
enough
for
a
double
pumpkin
ale
see
pumking
for
the
way
this
is
supposed
to
be
done
dmnice
crisp
and
clean
great
balance
of
flavors
and
alcohol
fairly
drinkable
after
some
aging
but
very
spicey
at
first
pours
a
moderate
orange
color
with
a
fairly
decent
head
that
receded
somewhat
quickly
nose
is
a
bit
overspiced
with
a
lot
of
nutmeg
coming
through
in
addition
to
other
pumpkin
pie
spices
the
taste
mixes
the
spicing
and
the
sweet
pumpkin
better
and
also
adds
in
a
little
bit
of
brown
sugar
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
of
the
night
but
pretty
good
overall
dry
malt
start
this
quickly
gives
way
to
strong
white
pepper
and
all
spice
flavors
the
finish
is
very
dry
the
aftertaste
is
similar
to
pumpkin
pie
without
sugar
the
body
is
decent
but
the
carbonation
is
quite
high
overall
a
very
dry
ale
all
in
all
this
is
a
solid
brew
not
amazing
but
good
good
to
try
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
otherwise
dont
bother
hunting
down
d
very
drinkable
this
will
definitely
be
on
my
beer
list
for
the
next
fall
season
flavor
follows
the
nose
very
closely
which
is
a
good
thing
there
is
a
gentle
warming
sensation
from
the
alcohol
but
its
not
overwhelming
a
bit
too
thin
for
my
taste
but
not
so
much
so
that
it
really
takes
away
from
this
overall
excellent
beer
would
definitely
drink
more
of
this
d
this
is
a
really
nice
pumpkin
if
you
enjoy
more
spice
with
your
pumpkin
beers
like
a
pumpking
or
dfh
punkin
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
tried
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
i
find
them
for
the
most
part
to
be
very
sweet
and
over
spiced
i
also
find
cloves
to
be
nauseating
when
this
was
poured
into
a
small
glass
for
me
i
was
very
wary
it
pours
slightly
darker
than
most
pumpkin
ales
and
had
a
spicy
chai
scent
with
pertruding
clove
aroma
taste
was
out
of
this
world
though
somehow
the
pumpkin
compliments
the
spices
and
actually
is
incredibly
mellow
very
drinkable
with
little
to
no
alcohol
present
the
only
pumpkin
ale
that
i
would
recommend
notes
sure
this
could
do
with
an
additional
hefty
note
and
still
be
quite
notable
as
a
pumpkin
ale
but
in
this
incarnation
it
feels
very
well
rounded
so
why
touch
it
drinkable
enough
but
this
is
no
pumpking
or
punkin
was
happy
to
see
this
local
brewer
win
an
award
at
the
gabf
though
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
it
kind
of
has
an
orange
hue
to
it
the
head
is
very
short
lived
and
leaves
the
beer
looking
extremely
flat
the
aroma
is
quite
a
spicy
one
name
the
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
it
is
there
cinnamon
stands
out
as
well
as
the
nutmeg
and
allspice
light
ginger
clove
and
pepper
is
picked
up
as
well
has
kind
of
a
big
red
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
very
spicy
as
well
big
cinnamon
flavor
along
with
some
nutmeg
the
taste
doesnt
seem
as
spicy
as
the
aroma
unfortunatly
i
dont
pick
up
much
pumpkin
flavors
but
there
is
a
solid
malt
body
so
that
the
spice
doesnt
overwhelm
this
beer
the
flavor
is
ok
but
it
is
an
all
spice
pumpkin
ale
the
higher
abv
doesnt
seem
to
ruin
this
beer
like
other
imperial
or
double
pumpkin
ales
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
prickly
carbonation
a
bit
sticky
i
guess
one
of
the
better
all
pumpkin
spice
no
pumpkin
flavored
beers
however
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
likes
of
dfh
or
smuttynose
d
this
is
not
something
of
which
i
would
want
to
consume
more
than
a
small
snifter
it
might
make
a
nice
pairing
with
pie
or
cobbler
on
a
brisk
autumn
day
a
small
serving
goes
a
long
way
very
well
crafted
and
certainly
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tried
d
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
but
not
as
good
as
some
people
think
imo
i
was
hoping
this
would
at
least
approach
the
level
of
pumking
but
it
most
certainly
does
not
gabf
gold
medal
not
if
i
was
one
of
the
judges
d
this
beer
was
very
good
i
could
have
no
problem
having
a
pint
of
this
and
asking
for
another
one
the
abv
is
a
little
putoff
toward
the
overall
drinkability
of
this
beer
a
damn
good
pumpkin
beer
that
i
would
put
in
my
top
5
d
lets
not
kid
ourselves
its
a
strongly
flavored
8
4
beer
but
please
dont
let
that
stop
you
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
in
any
form
you
must
try
this
supprisingly
drinkalbe
for
a
8
4
spiced
beer
nothing
really
over
powering
and
a
pretty
good
base
beer
drinkability
is
ok
but
there
are
many
other
pumpkin
ales
i
would
rather
have
for
me
there
are
some
other
pumpkin
beers
out
there
that
take
preference
still
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
not
turn
away
and
will
have
again
d
the
taste
is
good
but
not
great
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
hit
the
high
standard
i
have
come
to
expect
from
this
brewery
it
is
by
no
means
a
failure
but
it
is
far
from
amazing
this
beer
is
very
exciting
at
a
nice
abv
around
eight
percent
the
smell
matches
its
taste
too
me
and
the
flavord
are
not
spritzy
a
nice
mellow
not
to
deep
pumpkin
ale
just
some
good
shit
not
too
sweet
drinkability
is
great
i
love
it
well
balanced
no
overpowering
of
the
cinnamon
and
other
spices
better
than
pumpking
and
dogfish
heads
d
an
immensely
drinkable
brew
i
put
a
few
of
these
aside
in
my
cellar
last
year
along
with
some
other
heavier
pumpkins
so
will
be
interesting
to
sip
alongside
the
new
release
for
2010
to
see
how
they
stack
nice
job
once
again
hoppin
frog
d
a
pretty
nice
pumpkin
ale
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
little
sweeter
but
good
none
the
less
would
drink
again
d
massive
quantity
is
not
the
name
of
this
beer
it
was
a
struggle
to
get
through
the
whole
bottle
myself
with
that
said
i
think
this
would
be
quite
good
with
a
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
on
a
nice
cold
autumn
day
d
this
is
the
second
recommended
pumpkin
beer
that
did
have
a
pretty
good
sweetness
but
came
off
more
of
a
malt
liquor
with
a
pretty
high
boozy
factor
i
guess
i
will
have
to
age
pumking
and
hope
the
malt
and
hops
work
it
out
and
become
smooth
not
hoppy
bitter
d
i
couldnt
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
stuff
because
this
is
definitely
more
of
a
gourmet
dessert
type
of
beer
but
like
most
desserts
if
someone
offered
me
another
morsel
i
wouldnt
throw
a
shit
fit
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
a
double
pumpkin
a
little
heavy
in
the
stomach
drinking
a
growler
solo
would
be
tough
but
with
some
family
this
drank
nicely
and
i
would
be
happy
to
give
it
another
go
next
year
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
that
i
likely
wont
pick
up
again
my
wife
and
i
tend
to
stick
to
oktoberfest
beers
this
time
of
the
year
occasionally
we
grab
a
pumpkin
but
we
usually
end
up
regretting
our
decision
oh
well
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
color
with
a
half
inch
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
not
much
lacing
at
all
aroma
is
very
strong
and
spicy
mostly
like
cinnamon
and
cloves
but
with
some
nutmeg
ginger
and
pumpkin
noticable
too
i
can
taste
all
the
spices
and
pumpkin
but
for
whatever
reason
the
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
what
this
brew
smells
like
its
a
lot
weaker
tasting
than
i
thought
it
would
be
at
least
compared
to
the
aroma
anyway
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
with
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
enough
its
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
think
its
worth
trying
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
this
beer
is
a
deep
orange
but
barely
had
any
head
the
smell
is
all
cinnamon
at
first
with
other
spices
coming
later
smells
like
big
red
gum
the
taste
reminds
me
of
toothpaste
minty
with
some
cinnamon
not
what
i
expected
the
body
is
also
kind
of
thin
for
being
imperial
overall
a
disappointment
maybe
a
bad
bottle
drinkability
while
it
may
be
a
little
overly
spiced
its
still
very
good
and
easily
in
my
top
3
pumpkin
ales
now
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
and
packs
a
bit
of
a
punch
so
its
going
to
be
a
tad
more
moderate
but
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
several
more
of
these
over
the
course
of
the
season
hoppin
frog
finally
hit
a
home
run
in
my
book
and
i
am
definitely
going
to
pick
this
one
up
to
share
with
others
to
sum
it
up
smells
great
tastes
great
looks
okay
and
drinks
well
overall
this
wasnt
memorable
i
had
it
fresh
and
its
gone
downhill
a
touch
in
the
cellar
but
it
was
never
that
great
to
begin
with
ill
pass
this
year
except
for
one
bottle
to
compare
with
my
other
cellared
bottle
but
i
dont
have
high
hopes
from
what
i
remember
sorry
frogs
thankfully
this
season
brings
us
one
release
closer
to
the
amazing
frosted
frog
skip
the
pumpkin
pie
and
go
straight
for
the
frosting
man
open
the
bottle
and
it
smell
like
warm
pumpkin
pie
i
was
ready
to
eat
pour
it
to
the
bottle
nice
mid
amber
in
color
the
taste
is
awsome
pumpkin
flavor
everywhere
and
not
to
heavy
in
spices
you
can
taste
the
pumpkin
in
every
sip
sucks
dont
have
pumpkin
pie
on
hand
to
drink
this
with
boy
this
is
a
good
beer
this
is
a
must
try
for
anyone
that
havent
try
this
beer
d
frogs
hollow
is
a
wonderful
version
of
the
style
it
may
not
look
as
beautiful
as
st
pumking
or
dfh
punkin
ale
but
it
tastes
every
bit
as
good
the
balanced
flavors
of
pumpkin
and
spice
keep
my
mouth
watering
through
the
entire
bottle
ill
be
sure
to
look
for
more
of
this
brew
in
the
fall
along
with
my
other
favorites
mentioned
above
the
body
has
some
slickness
to
it
like
a
hefeweizen
reminds
me
of
a
weizenbock
actually
pretty
nice
ill
look
for
this
again
in
the
fall
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
almost
full
the
body
is
also
very
smooth
and
slick
the
beer
disappeared
from
my
glass
rapidly
i
look
forward
to
having
this
beer
again
come
the
hallows
season
well
done
d
easy
to
drink
for
sure
ill
pick
this
one
up
for
sure

it

it

a
great

of
spices
and
malts
smooth
going
down
with
no
real

great
ale
to
enjoy
and

will
add
to
my
radar
for
purchasing
again
md
smooth
lightmedium
bodied
for
some
reason
it
seems
powdery
to
me
i
dont
think
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
this
beer
flexes
hard
yeah
it
has
its
pumpkin
spiced
side
but
the
imperial
side
shows
off
a
bit
i
dig
this
beer
a
lot
medium
body
with
light
to
medium
carbonation
overall
this
really
wasnt
too
bad
but
couldve
been
pulled
off
a
lot
better
it
seemed
better
as
a
spiced
beer
than
as
a
true
pumpkin
ale
and
i
expected
better
from
hoppin
frog
a
nice
try
and
certainly
not
a
drainpour
but
not
worth
what
was
paid
d
pretty
solid
imperial
pumpkin
ale
although
i
wouldnt
rate
this
on
par
with
the
likes
of
say
pumking
ultimately
the
spiciness
gets
a
bit
heavyhanded
which
prevents
the
pumpkin
character
from
really
shining
a
most
welcome
new
addition
to
the
increasing
number
of
imperial
pumpkin
ales
out
there
over
the
last
couple
of
years
this
one
did
a
nice
job
of
providing
plenty
of
both
pumpkin
meat
and
spice
flavorings
while
most
importantly
keeping
the
heat
levels
at
a
minimum
a
full
22
of
this
did
start
to
wear
a
bit
on
the
palate
after
a
bit
however
id
recommend
splitting
this
one
with
a
buddy
couldve
been
better
considering
how
much
i
like
hoppin
frogs
russian
imperial
stout
and
double
ipa
i
figured
this
could
threaten
the
throne
of
the
great
pumking
but
no
it
doesnt

orange
with
a
very
small
ring
of
white
head
aroma
of
pumpkin
spices
mostly
lots
of
ginger
pepper
clove
nutmeg
flavor
is
equally
spicy
with
only
a
touch
of
pumpkin
pie
crust
on
the
sweet
side
overall
it
just
isnt
very
tasty
nor
very
pumpkiny
bleh
a
nice
attempt
to
try
something
new
with
a
pumpkin
beer
by
adding
the
ginger
however
i
expected
more
pumpkin
in
a
beer
labeled
double
pumpkin
ale
maybe
the
double
was
only
meant
to
modify
ale
and
not
pumpkin
frogs
hollow
double
pumpkin
ale
is
closer
to
single
and
a
half
pumpkin
ale
even
though
it
earns
the
same
scores
as
the
three
other
imperial
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
reviewed
so
far
from
southern
tier
weyerbacher
and
schlafly
its
my
least
favorite
again
more

would
fix
it
right
up

with

that
all
but
disappeared

at
all
aroma

mostly
the

lots
of
cinnamon

a
little
bit
of
pumpkin
aroma
in
the
background
taste
is
similar
lots
of
spices
spices
are
a
little
too
much
for
me
cinnamon
is
the
main
flavor
i
get
would
have
liked
to
taste
a
little
more
of
the
pumpkin
instead
of
the
spices
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
d
a
nice
pumpkin
brew
the
spices
are
not
overpowring
and
are
great
throughout
ive
had
a
few
pumpkin
ales
and
this
truley
is
the
best
ive
had
i
like
this
thanks
boatshoes
light

maybe
too
light
carbonation
also
seems
light
alcohol
is
well
hidden
not
bad
the
taste
was
ok
a
little
to
strong
on
nutmeg
almost
makes
you
gap
until
youve
had
a
few
drinks
and
youre
used
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
but
not
highly
drinkable
hoppin
frog
brews
some
tasty
beer
theyve
quickly
become
a
gem
here
in
ohio
frogs
hollow
isnt
their
best
beer
but
its
definitely
good
enough
to
warrant
an
annual
release
the
only
problem
with
it
is
the
lack
of
head
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
thats
not
too
big
of
a
deal
its
probably
a
little
better
than
the
final
score
will
reveal
for
that
reason
but
it
is
what
it
is
good
stuff
guys
this
borders
on
a
dessert
beer
and
is
not
really
a
session
beer
for
me
as
it
is
sweet
i
split
the
bomber
with
my
wife
and
both
of
us
enjoyed
it
edit
finish
on
this
is
amazing
it
tastes
like
ive
just
eaten
pumpkin
pie
only
really
get
the
full
effect
of
it
after
you
havent
taken
a
sip
after
a
few
minutes
because
of
the
mouthfeel
and
the
over
spicing
drinkability
is
just
average
i
had
no
problems
finishing
this
bomber
but
i
doubt
ill
grab
another
any
time
soon
notes
this
beer
really
jumps
around
everywhere
on
the
categories
in
my
opinion
the
taste
was
unexpected
compared
to
the
smell
but
i
guess
that
is
the
beauty
of
beer
worth
having
again
and
a
nice
beer
for
anyone
looking
for
a
pumpkin
ale
the
beer
is
penny
copper
color
clear
with
about
2
fingers
of
whitish
foam
the
dominant
smells
are
spices
like
youd
find
in
gingerbread
cookies
and
pumpkin
pie
per
the
label
cinnamon
ginger
nutmeg
allspice
and
clove
the
taste
is
exceptionally
good
often
these
spices
are
overdone
in
a
pumpkin
ale
but
this
beer
has
enough
pale
malt
sweetness
to
balance
the
spices
that
might
be
why
its
called
a
double
pumpkin
ale
theres
enough
malt
to
add
body
and
abv
to
this
beer
to
combat
the
spice
making
this
probably
my
favorite
of
the
style
ill
look
for
it
again
next
year
would
consider
purchasing
again
next
season
i
also
purchased
a
case
of
dogfishhead
punkin
ale
so
i
look
forward
to
comparing
the
two
drinkability
the
first
thing
that
pops
into
my
head
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
a
victim
of
its
own
success
this
is
one
of
the
finer
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
but
its
just
too
much
to
be
an
all
night
drinker
its
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
cool
autumn
night
but
i
dont
think
i
could
do
more
than
one
in
an
evening
d
this
was
a
good
pumpkin
ale
but
it
did
not
rise
to
the
grand
level
of
pumking
and
punkin
which
i
think
are
the
best
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
somewhat
thin
disappointing
im
not
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
so
i
am
reviewing
this
in
respect
to
the
style
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
ever
had
probably
going
to
buy
a
case
of
these
to
last
me
through
october
second
favorite
imperial
pumpkin
definitely
try
it
creamy
medium
body
which
is
on
the
fuller
end
with
a
nice
malt
presence
and
a
very
prominent
pumpkin
pie
spiciness
pretty
sweet
but
not
too
much
so
with
a
healthy
dose
of
ginger
and
clove
accompanying
some
brown
sugar
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
masked
making
this
very
drinkable
the
prominent
ginger
and
clove
notes
provide
this
pumpkin
beer
with
a
nice
twist
that
separates
it
from
many
of
average
pumpkin
beers
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
still
very
good
if
you
want
an
imperial
pumpkin
stick
with
southern
tier
even
if
this
years
version
is
too
heavy
on
the
cinnamon
im
thinking
the
overall
impression
of
this
is
definitely
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
this
is
enjoyable
as
hell
and
i
have
to
anoint
this
as
my
new
favorite
in
the
pumpkin
category
sure
it
has
a
little
weight
to
it
but
the
balance
and
smoothness
do
it
very
well
if
you
enjoy
pumpkin
beers
this
is
a
mustsnag
drinkability
suffers
a
little
from
the
heat
but
pretty
enjoyable
overall
ranks
3
in
my
book
for
imperial
pumpkins
behind
weyerbacher
and
southern
tier
the
pumpkin
flavor
comes
through
more
noticeably
in
the
flavor
this
beer
is
still
dominated
by
the
spices
though
fairly
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
at
least
more
thin
than
i
would
like
it
to
be
still
very
enjoyable
i
think
a
bomber
is
more
than
enough
of
this
beer
would
have
liked
to
see
more
pumpkin
in
the
flavor
and
a
fuller
mouthfeel
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
poured
into
my
standard
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
copper
color
with
about
an
inch
of
creamy
off
white
foam
the
foam
settles
to
a
thin
ring
in
a
minute
or
so
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
vanilla
cinnamon
nutmeg
roasted
grain
brown
sugar
allspice
maybe
some
ginger
mostly
dominated
by
spices
not
pumpkin
nice
medium
to
full
body
and
amply
carbonated
to
match
the
bold
spices
pretty
tasty
overall
i
have
to
admit
i
have
very
limited
tasting
experince
in
pumpkin
ales
but
i
tend
to
enjoy
the
ones
that
are
heavier
on
the
spices
this
one
fits
the
bill
nicely
and
is
a
very
festive
and
tasty
beer
not
quite
as
stellar
as
pumking
but
is
still
going
to
be
a
staple
in
the
fridge
throughout
the
fall
months
beers
like
this
is
the
reason
i
love
the
fall
so
much
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
as
said
before
i
will
place
this
in
my
top5
favorite
pumpkin
ales
but
i
would
probably
not
seek
this
beer
out
again
in
anticipation
of
its
release
drinkability
although
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
so
is
the
pumpkin
and
this
beer
ultimately
overwhelms
with
the
spices
overall
a
pretty
solid
imperial
pumpkin
ale
i
would
drink
this
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
throughout
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
spice
forward
pumpkin
ale
that
didnt
come
together
as
nicely
as
some
others
ive
had
lots
of
ginger
lingers
on
with
each
sip
worth
a
shot
but
i
wish
the
spices
were
toned
down
a
bit
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pumpkin
beer
massive
spice
notes
blended
beautifully
with
the
malt
absolutely
delicious
this
absolutely
goes
on
my
pumpkin
beers
rotation
this
is
probably
the
best
they
brew
amazing
pumpkin
beer
everything
about
it
is
just
right
continues
to
be
my
favorite
yep
raul
is
ok
with
this
one
delicious
drinkable
pumpkin
beers
this
one
is
a
top
5
pumpkin
for
me
lots
of
nutmeg
and
fresh
pumpkin
great
out
of
the
little
brewery
in
williamsburg
i
was
wrong
this
is
pumpkin
pie
filling
in
a
bottle
full
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
the
most
authentic
pumpkin
taste
in
a
beer
yet
i
can
tell
alewerks
must
have
used
real
pumpkin
puree
for
this
one
its
very
smooth
pretty
sweetnot
cloyingly
so
though
different
ive
never
had
a
pumpkin
ale
that
taste
less
like
pumpkin
pie
and
more
like
actual
pumpkin
definitely
spiced
though
lots
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
on
the
pumpkin
beer
spectrum
that
ranges
from
pumpkin
pie
to
gourd
in
flavor
alewerks
pumpkin
ale
is
certainly
more
toward
the
pie
side
this
beer
tastes
quite
rich
with
notes
of
vanilla
caramel
creme
brûlée
and
pumpkin
pie
i
also
found
the
beer
to
have
a
strong
alcohol
taste
and
i
thought
it
became
a
bit
cloying
as
it
warmed
overall
its
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
but
could
be
refined
a
bit
so
that
the
sweetalcohol
flavors
dont
overpower
the
other
more
subtle
notes
a
great
pumpkin
beer
i
rate
it
just
a
notch
under
wild
wolf
howlling
pumpkin
simply
because
it
seems
a
bit
raw
i
did
like
the
bite
though
so
its
basically
a
tossup
for
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
overall
this
one
is
definitely
in
my
top
5
pumpkin
beers
im
gonna
have
to
try
this
and
schlaflys
side
by
side
and
see
which
is
better
i
have
a
suspicion
it
may
be
this
one
o
excellent
extra
in
a
trade
that
is
super
fresh
not
available
in
md
and
delicious
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
ale
that
everyone
needs
to
try
perfect
for
every
fall
day
or
thanksgiving
dinner
as
a
fan
of
my
local
brewery
i
feel
the
need
to
also
be
honest
aroma
was
light
head
was
small
color
was
amazing
i
have
not
seen
a
prettier
goldenorange
brilliant
color
it
is
amazing
the
taste
is
all
over
the
place
there
is
a
cool
sweetness
that
hits
you
first
and
the
the
pumpkin
and
spices
come
next
the
end
has
a
bitter
nutmeg
taste
that
to
me
is
not
appealing
need
a
little
more
balance
in
this
brew
i
usually
enjoy
pumpkin
beers
that
are
sweet
and
heavily
spiced
but
alewerkss
rendition
contained
a
bit
too
much
of
both
for
my
liking
perhaps
this
beer
would
benefit
from
a
more
dynamic
flavor
profile
and
a
touch
less
sweetness
being
that
it
is
intensely
fresh
i
went
with
a
very
heavyhanded
pour
creating
an
initial
pseudocascade
which
settled
into
two
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
good
retention
color
was
light
copper
to
copper
srm
13
17
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
an
oddly
fruity
quality
underlain
by
the
spice
not
the
other
way
around
which
is
more
standard
mouthfeel
was
medium
the
taste
was
interestingly
more
sweet
than
spicy
more
in
keeping
with
what
pumpkin
pie
tastes
like
and
which
the
style
was
originally
meant
to
mimic
i
also
liked
that
the
spices
were
not
overwhelmed
by
cinnamon
which
can
sometimes
saturate
this
style
of
beer
instead
the
spices
seemed
to
be
more
even
and
as
such
more
pleasant
finish
was
dry
thanks
to
the
spices
but
not
so
dry
and
spicy
as
to
be
offputting
i
would
say
that
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
that
i
have
tried
o
you
must
try
this
beer
its
absolutely
stunning
if
you
have
it
at
the
right
temperature
overall
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
so
far
o
this
is
a
clear
winner
well
done
with
a
great
taste
i
will
be
shopping
for
this
one
every
year
from
now
on
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
a
little
different
from
the
normal
pumpkin
ale
but
enjoyable
with
a
baked
pumpkin
flavor
moreso
than
spices
which
collectively
i
found
very
enjoyable
o
overall
a
really
nice
pumpkin
beer
must
try
for
fans
of
the
style
one
of
the
better
ones
an
impressive
pumpkin
ale
that
is
worthy
of
the
name
my
only
complaint
is
that
this
beer
flies
off
the
shelves
and
unavailable
if
someone
is
not
quick
enough
to
get
one
this
lightly
carbonated
pumpkin
ale
pours
to
leave
a
nice
thick
ring
of
head
about
1
finger
deep
the
aromas
smell
like
a
true
pumpkin
beer
should
smell
like
not
a
pie
or
air
freshener
you
can
smell
the
brown
sugar
nutmeg
cinnamon
baked
apples
and
loads
of
pumpkin
almost
like
a
pumpkin
meat
pie
i
tasted
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
first
its
heavy
sweetness
puts
the
melting
pot
of
spices
in
the
right
place
this
is
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
cold
november
evening
it
is
very
balanced
and
goes
down
extremely
smooth
it
has
a
spicy
aftertaste
that
leaves
a
smooth
but
sweet
taste
in
your
mouth
many
pumpkin
beers
are
unbalanced
either
too
sweet
or
too
spicy
this
one
is
just
right
pumking
is
just
a
prince
to
this
ale
grab
it
when
you
find
it
if
you
like
pumpkin
ale
a
6
pack
of
bottles
goes
down
very
easy
case
is
only
44
i
feel
i
might
have
been
spoiled
here
this
trade
extra
is
my
first
pumpkin
ale
and
from
what
i
have
seen
it
has
the
highest
rating
amongst
the
pumpkin
ale
offerings
any
reservations
i
had
about
enjoying
a
pumpkin
ale
have
been
annihilated
by
this
incredible
brew
but
how
does
it
get
better
than
this
if
you
can
get
you
hands
on
this
one
do
not
pass
it
by
or
cast
doubts
on
how
enjoyable
a
pumpkin
ale
can
be
this
is
a
winner
o
a
very
drinkable
ale
for
a
higher
abv
beer
that
said
it
tends
to
the
sweet
side
to
balance
an
alcohol
bite
some
mind
find
this
offputting
but
it
works
for
me
for
a
beer
thats
supposed
to
be
flavored
an
interesting
beer
but
the
spice
levels
cover
anything
of
any
real
value
instead
of
enhancing
it
nice
carbonation
light
but
not
watered
down
i
still
dont
see
the
outstanding
rating
but
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
o
this
is
one
malted
beast
of
a
pumpkin
ale
i
really
respect
williamsburg
alewerks
approach
this
is
focused
primarily
on
the
pumpkin
and
malts
with
spices
only
coming
secondary
a
rather
hefty
brew
at
8
abv
that
would
be
best
enjoyed
on
cold
fall
evenings
this
is
what
a
pumpkin
beer
should
taste
like
it
hits
all
the
right
notes
and
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
without
over
doing
it
ogreat
balance
of
spice
and
pumpkin
flavor
in
this
beer
really
enjoyable
and
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
edit
having
this
right
now
with
schlafly
and
theyre
both
outstanding
this
is
more
sweet
upfront
and
then
roasted
on
the
end
but
theyre
both
outstanding
brews
o
if
you
read
my
other
reviews
youll
soon
find
that
i
like
my
beers
to
be
balanced
in
terms
of
flavors
there
is
no
balance
here
at
all
its
all
sugar
and
spice
and
nothing
else
nice
drinkable
once
but
there
are
far
better
pumpkin
ales
to
be
had
totally
blown
away
from
this
beer
and
i
want
more
i
love
this
beer
i
was
in
phonexville
at
the
end
of
fall
last
year
and
happened
to
walk
into
a
bar
that
had
it
on
tap
i
have
had
alot
of
pumpkins
beers
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
i
live
in
philly
and
am
excited
for
the
fall
mainly
because
of
this
beer
i
hope
that
it
finds
me
again
as
i
continue
to
search
for
it
overall
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
even
though
they
typically
arent
my
thing
good
addition
of
spices
to
remain
strong
but
not
too
fatiguing
malts
play
a
huge
role
in
providing
a
biscuit
cookie
and
shortbread
type
of
flavor
profile
certainly
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
slightly
below
average
pumpkin
ale
8
410
its
a
really
good
pumpkin
beer
it
does
have
a
good
dose
of
spices
yet
still
keeps
a
good
sweet
balance
to
it
overall
its
probably
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
of
this
season
overall
this
was
an
excellent
pumpkin
beer
and
an
even
more
excellent
extra
in
an
already
awesome
trade
should
have
saved
this
for
thanksgiving
but
im
not
sorry
i
drank
it
cheers
o
this
was
pretty
good
with
good
balance
the
flavor
and
mouth
are
very
satisfying
this
is
going
on
my
top
list
for
pumpkin
ales
so
far
my
only
gripe
is
that
the
aroma
could
be
more
pungent
i
would
recommend
and
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
savor
great
beer
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
for
the
fall
season
this
beer
poured
with
a
very
minimal
head
5
inch
and
had
a
very
smooth
sweet
taste
to
it
the
robust
spices
and
flavor
had
very
little
bite
and
tasted
like
a
bit
of
heaven
to
me
i
thouroughly
enjoyed
it
and
would
highly
recommend
it
especially
for
being
a
virginia
beer
final
thoughts
ive
hadreviewed
many
pumpkin
beers
this
fall
and
this
is
probably
my
favorite
unlike
others
it
balances
the
flavors
superbly
and
delivers
a
true
pumpkin
pie
experience
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
o
a
bit
on
the
richer
side
of
the
pumpkin
beer
spectrum
williamsburg
alewerks
pumpkin
ale
combats
the
notion
pumpkin
beers
abandon
the
beer
characteristics
for
a
pielike
flavor
with
its
hoppy
earthy
aroma
and
rich
malt
profile
the
pumpkin
is
there
but
it
takes
some
warming
up
for
this
stronger
sipper
to
open
up
fully
serving
type
bottle
o
wow
this
was
a
great
pumpkin
ale
the
best
ive
had
thus
far
the
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
flavors
didnt
taste
artificial
which
is
what
sets
this
apart
from
others
the
finish
and
linger
was
so
refreshing
this
one
is
a
must
try
o
overall
i
say
you
can
chuck
the
appearance
out
the
front
door
for
a
flavor
like
this
it
may
not
be
the
prettiest
beer
but
it
tastes
near
perfect
i
would
buy
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
its
perfect
for
those
looking
for
a
nice
autumn
holiday
beer
i
was
shocked
to
see
that
it
is
8
abv
on
the
website
because
i
couldnt
tell
when
drinking
it
i
will
grab
a
few
more
when
i
get
the
chance
poured
an
orangecopper
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
small
white
head
moderate
retention
and
lacing
mostly
spice
in
the
aroma
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
by
me
cinnamon
allspice
caramel
pumpkin
similar
taste
with
cinnamon
being
a
dominant
factor
caramel
malts
nutshells
allspice
nutmeg
mild
pumpkin
flavors
which
again
is
ok
i
like
big
flavor
in
my
pumpkin
ales
but
that
can
come
from
the
spice
too
this
was
nice
almost
like
a
simple
spiced
brown
ale
medium
body
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
very
good
especially
as
pumpkin
ales
go
it
has
a
lot
of
depth
and
isnt
overly
sweet
most
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
recently
schlaflys
weyerbachers
cover
their
alcohol
pretty
well
and
this
one
does
the
same
while
its
still
early
for
pumpkin
ales
im
glad
i
had
this
one
and
wouldnt
mind
another
as
the
season
goes
on
o
this
is
a
fantastic
spiced
beer
with
a
dash
of
pumpkin
at
the
moment
it
is
easily
my
favorite
representation
of
the
style
o
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
the
flavors
work
well
together
and
there
are
really
no
flaws
to
the
beer
however
the
aroma
is
way
different
than
the
taste
and
the
pumpkin
is
pretty
weak
its
balanced
but
not
amazing
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
offering
that
sits
in
the
better
half
of
its
class
the
flavor
was
nearly
spoton
for
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
with
a
good
balance
of
both
sweet
pumpkin
flavor
and
the
appropriate
spices
however
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
the
most
pleasing
for
me
and
held
back
the
beer
as
a
whole
ill
have
to
try
this
beer
again
to
see
if
the
mouthfeel
is
better
than
this
experience
and
pair
it
with
a
nice
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
as
well
solid
pumpkin
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
like
many
pumpkin
beers
this
is
markedly
better
on
draft
but
this
review
is
from
a
bottle
overall
one
of
the
best
in
the
class
i
wish
i
lived
by
this
brewery
cause
i
would
live
there
in
the
fall
beer
is
sweet
tastes
like
a
cookie
really
biscuity
and
strong
forward
on
the
spice
but
again
it
tastes
like
a
graham
cracker
with
pumpkin
butter
on
it
it
was
enjoyable
i
may
even
have
this
one
again
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
efes
tulip
low
headretention
minimal
lacing
murky
muddy
coppery
colored
with
aroma
of
cardamom
nutmeg
malty
sugary
sweetness
and
pumpkin
rind
taste
actually
seems
dominated
by
cardamom
some
light
spicing
on
the
back
end
maybe
nutmeg
the
alcohol
is
very
unnoticeable
and
this
one
is
very
easy
to
drink
interesting
take
on
a
pumpkin
the
beer
appears
orange
to
brown
hued
a
fine
color
for
an
autumn
beer
the
aroma
brings
pumpkin
right
up
front
followed
by
cinnamon
nutmeg
pie
vanilla
malt
the
flavor
is
great
with
flavors
of
pumpkin
pie
vanilla
and
fall
spices
a
bit
sweet
but
not
too
certainly
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
d
this
was
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
more
like
carrot
cake
than
pumpkin
pie
which
i
personally
prefer
great
scent
and
taste
with
nice
body
alcohol
is
well
hidden
too
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
recommended
o
an
excellent
pumpkin
ale
that
came
out
of
nowhere
right
up
there
with
my
favorite
schlafly
as
a
top
contender
would
have
all
the
time
if
it
was
local
yum
o
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
ever
had
wish
i
could
find
it
more
readily
and
that
it
was
produced
for
a
longer
season
i
could
see
drinking
this
all
winter
if
it
was
an
option
o
if
the
brew
was
a
little
more
robust
and
had
a
bigger
body
it
would
be
fantastic
i
think
its
a
little
thin
for
the
abv
and
it
can
support
a
little
more
pumpkin
flavor
overall
it
is
a
better
pumpkin
beer
compared
to
what
is
available
out
there
overall
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
what
i
expect
a
pumpkin
ale
to
be
like
light
with
tastes
of
the
fall
season
this
beer
is
not
only
good
but
it
fits
the
type
perfectly
edited
to
reflect
repeated
drinking
and
increased
appreciation
for
what
alewerks
does
with
their
pumpkin
ale
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
after
mixed
results
from
other
williamsburg
beer
but
this
hit
the
spot
on
a
chilly
fall
evening
it
doesnt
exactly
stand
out
in
the
crowd
but
this
isnt
a
style
with
a
deep
range
theres
a
rich
pumpkin
pie
spice
aroma
and
initial
flavor
followed
by
a
slightly
nutty
toffee
malt
character
the
body
is
light
enough
to
not
let
on
the
strength
i
was
surprised
to
learn
its
8
so
watch
out
for
this
one
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
o
this
is
one
of
williamsburgs
better
efforts
its
a
balanced
and
tasty
beer
somehow
i
missed
this
pumpkin
beer
during
my
time
in
nova
its
nice
to
trade
isnt
it
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
lightly
cloudy
sunset
tawny
topped
by
maybe
a
halffinger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
pumpkin
seeds
cinnamon
nutmeg
light
rye
bread
clove
and
brown
sugar
the
spices
hang
heavily
but
not
overbearingly
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
instead
of
the
seeds
the
pumpkins
flesh
is
now
evident
producing
a
strange
ish
bitterness
that
undercuts
the
heavy
spicing
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
one
that
somehow
manages
to
spice
the
hell
out
of
it
without
oerwhelming
my
buds
in
the
process
pours
a
burnt
orange
with
no
appreciable
head
smells
spicy
and
has
a
bold
flavor
of
pumpkins
and
pie
spice
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
to
this
offering
but
it
is
nothing
unpleasant
by
any
means
there
are
also
some
apple
notes
as
well
perhaps
this
accounts
for
the
sweetness
the
sweetness
combines
nicely
with
a
very
light
alcohol
and
spice
finish
as
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
one
of
my
favorite
seasonal
styles
id
say
that
this
ranks
near
the
top
of
all
the
beers
i
sampled
this
year
happy
halloween
overall
this
is
among
the
best
what
a
nice
surprise
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
the
bitter
finish
could
have
been
a
little
bit
milder
pretty
good
and
i
would
have
another
o
significantly
better
fresh
though
its
also
possible
that
my
recovery
from
surgery
is
not
quite
complete
still
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
maybe
the
best
ive
encountered
highly
recommended
will
avidly
seek
out
on
tap
at
pizza
paradiso
in
old
town
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
hazy
deep
copper
toward
ruby
with
offwhite
head
nose
is
rich
caramel
malt
pumpkin
puree
and
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
tastes
delicious
rich
sweet
complex
with
a
huge
authentic
pumpkin
pureespice
flavor
even
notes
of
pie
crust
and
a
super
smooth
finish
wow
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
out
there
all
those
spices
rush
in
on
the
palate
like
a
tribe
in
assault
mode
starts
off
big
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
spice
warps
into
a
caramel
malt
sweet
and
finishes
mildly
drying
with
a
hint
of
nutmeg
this
along
with
good
gourd
from
ccb
are
probably
the
best
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
to
date
pours
a
clear
light
copper
with
a
silky
off
white
head
fades
to
a
thin
crown
little
lacing
or
carbonation
excellent
strong
yet
balanced
aroma
cider
like
with
pumpkin
mash
clove
cinnamon
nutmeg
etc
really
enjoying
the
complexity
of
spice
given
the
balance
provided
by
the
malt
and
pumpkin
medium
thick
body
with
an
oily
texture
and
a
light
syrupy
finish
flavor
is
sweet
and
has
a
surprising
amount
of
pumpkin
flavor
nice
to
not
just
have
a
spice
bomb
a
very
pleasant
warmer
distinct
from
the
other
local
suspects
like
pumpking
weyerbacher
etc
o
looks
and
smells
great
very
pumpkinlike
flavor
that
hides
the
alcohol
pretty
well
nice
mouthfeel
too
o
ive
heard
williamsburg
alewerks
has
been
producing
great
beers
for
some
time
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
them
easily
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
as
this
delectable
brew
allows
the
three
great
components
to
all
shine
in
stride
pumpkin
pumpkin
pie
and
beer
too
many
beers
of
this
ilk
tend
to
shade
towards
sweet
sticky
dessert
types
losing
many
of
the
raw
pumpkin
and
beer
qualities
not
this
one
its
thick
viscous
and
perfectly
balanced
outstanding
achievement
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
behind
schlafly
and
sts
pumking
ton
of
nice
cinnamon
and
gingerbread
and
super
easy
to
drink
i
would
certainly
buy
this
one
again
overall
a
really
nice
pumpkin
ale
though
perhaps
just
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
palate
o
wildly
impressed
i
might
even
go
back
to
philly
where
i
know
i
can
get
more
of
this
i
will
go
and
say
this
is
probably
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
to
date
and
this
year
ive
been
trying
as
many
as
i
can
get
my
hands
on
holy
shit
what
a
surprise
this
brew
was
i
love
when
this
happens
stumbling
upon
this
brew
makes
me
realize
that
i
dont
have
to
resort
to
pumking
as
much
for
a
solid
pumpkin
brew
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
nice
amberish
orange
color
with
a
light
fizzy
white
head
on
top
theres
really
no
lacing
or
anything
but
still
looks
pretty
nice
the
smell
of
this
beer
had
some
really
nice
autumn
aromas
and
spice
going
on
in
it
the
taste
is
unreal
i
couldnt
believe
how
good
this
tastes
the
flavors
even
get
better
as
it
warms
up
plenty
of
sweet
spices
on
tongue
with
a
nice
caramel
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
really
nice
also
overall
i
cant
believe
how
solid
this
beer
is
it
will
be
one
ill
be
on
the
look
out
for
in
the
future
for
sure
ill
be
lookin
for
more
before
this
season
is
up
really
gotta
try
this
one
this
really
was
a
real
treat
for
me
which
says
a
decent
amount
because
i
consider
myself
a
pumpkin
beer
fan
and
aficionado
i
am
going
to
have
to
sample
this
next
to
my
2
top
favorite
of
the
style
weyerbacher
and
hoppin
frog
to
see
how
it
compares
highly
highly
recommended
if
you
are
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
d
an
8
pumpkin
beer
that
drinks
like
a
liquid
pumpkin
pie
its
a
sipper
in
my
book
o
the
easiest
drinking
lightest
imperial
pumpkin
ive
had
if
the
abv
were
lower
itd
be
one
of
the
better
sessionish
pumpkins
out
there
too
a
good
blend
of
beer
and
pumpkin
drinkable
and
repeatable
would
prefer
a
little
more
head
retention
to
throw
me
that
spice
note
on
every
sip
not
quite
as
pielike
as
some
of
the
very
best
but
very
good
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
homer
beer
for
me
so
take
it
for
what
it
is
but
i
loved
it
def
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
so
far
with
my
limited
exposure
nice
example
of
style
very
enjoyable
abv
well
masked
pours
a
deep
burnt
orange
into
the
glass
minimal
head
that
disappeared
quickly
smell
is
nice
for
a
pumpkin
beer
hints
of
multiple
standard
spice
for
the
type
like
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
but
its
nice
to
actually
smell
pumpkin
itself
as
well
taste
is
spot
on
really
does
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
with
a
great
blend
of
spice
and
pumpkin
and
it
doesnt
feel
artificial
like
in
some
pumpkin
beers
mouthfeel
is
also
really
above
average
in
this
one
its
got
a
nice
smooth
feel
in
the
carbonation
that
is
not
sticky
or
cloying
like
you
can
find
in
some
spice
bombs
williamsburg
has
a
top
notch
seasonal
in
this
one
that
again
seems
to
be
flying
under
the
radar
for
some
reason
overall
a
great
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
that
ill
enjoy
in
the
fallwinter
while
watching
football
and
around
the
holidays
o
i
really
like
it
will
have
another
recommended
this
is
one
to
be
had
for
sure
the
flavors
may
be
a
bit
more
subtle
compared
to
others
in
the
style
but
still
completly
satisfying
overall
experience
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
not
to
crazy
like
some
that
make
the
beer
taste
like
a
dessert
very
warming
as
well
would
love
this
beer
on
tap
in
october
or
early
november

with
a
whispy
off

and
a
solid
ring
of

is
great
and

to

and
very
well
carbonated
with
a
great
balance

overall
another
great
new
brew
from
geoff
and
alewerks
bright
orange
color
very
opaque
glows
in
the
light
head
is
nonexistent
a
vigorous
pour
generates
a
few
bubbles
but
nothing
to
speak
of
looks
very
still
in
the
glass
aromas
are
of
pie
spice
and
candy
corn
body
is
surprisingly
light
for
the
high
abv
sweet
but
not
too
much
pumpkin
flavor
is
mellow
with
good
spice
and
pie
character
not
overdone
solid
beer
overall
but
i
think
it
was
better
a
few
months
ago
aroma
was
highly
spiced
but
yet
not
overpowering
as
you
see
a
lot
with
these
pumpkins
they
usually
put
too
much
of
everything
and
try
to
force
home
the
point
of
what
it
is
but
this
seemed
to
be
very
nice
and
subtle
it
had
a
lighter
overall
smell
then
some
lots
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
a
good
amount
of
fresh
grass
or
even
a
tree
like
smell
to
it
this
was
followed
by
loads
of
fall
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
lots
of
spiced
apple
just
a
good
all
around
mix
there
was
a
noticeable
hoppy
presence
and
this
definitely
could
not
be
hidden
great
finish
left
you
wanting
another
sip
almost
right
away
and
there
was
just
really
an
overall
light
and
vibrant
feel
and
flavor
to
this
again
very
well
put
together
super
light
but
yet
smooth
at
the
same
time
very
nice
carbonation
led
itself
to
this
and
really
helped
to
push
the
flavors
out
at
you
this
was
full
of
the
little
carbonation
bubbles
if
that
makes
any
sense
at
all
it
really
made
it
feel
silky
like
and
had
a
great
smoothness
to
it
second
only
to
pumpking
in
terms
of
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
so
far
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
i
love
that
they
use
real
roasted
pumpkin
and
they
also
really
do
get
the
spices
right
for
a
beer
the
sweetness
really
cuts
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
nicely
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
of
the
season
and
one
i
will
buy
annually
right
along
with
pumking
finding
the
perfect
balance
in
a
pumpkin
ale
is
hard
to
achievewilliamsburg
alewerks
nailed
it
here
certainly
big
enough
to
throw
at
the
heartiest
of
holiday
meals
a
real
winter
warmer
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
seasonal
even
above
pumking
and
punkin
i
like
the
sweetness
and
the
huge
pumpkin
spice
aroma
that
is
unmistakeable
in
this
beer
from
a
small
virginia
brewery
reviewed
on
1102010
bottle
thanks
to
dkachur
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
pumpkin
pumpkin
pie
crust
and
spices
flavor
is
pure
pumpkin
pie
the
pumpkin
crust
and
even
whipped
cream
on
top
pumpkin
spices
in
the
finish
on
the
sweet
side
and
a
little
syrupy
it
becomes
a
little
cloying
by
the
end
of
the
glass
but
its
certainly
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
d
really
really
tasty
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
worth
seeking
out
d
only
have
a
single
bottle
of
this
and
that
is
enough
a
great
beer
is
in
here
but
they
need
to
play
with
the
spices
a
little
bit
which
is
a
really
hard
thing
to
nail
down
the
pumpkin
in
this
is
nice
and
not
muted
with
a
mild
caramel
malt
backing
and
slight
toasted
taste
with
lighly
sweet
yet
substantial
malt
flavor
the
spiced
middle
is
moderate
and
holds
on
to
the
end
with
creamy
quality
and
subtle
pepper
w
a
hint
of
nutmeg
the
vegetal
flavor
is
there
but
kept
to
a
minimum
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
pumpkin
w
good
drinkabiity
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
but
there
is
a
nice
amount
of
spice
too
this
style
is
one
i
might
not
drink
often
but
this
is
above
average
with
very
subtle
alcohol
for
the
abv
dalcohol
is
very
well
hidden
very
drinkable
d
i
love
this
one
it
was
a
top
notch
pumpkin
beer
if
only
it
was
available
in
my
area
i
would
have
brought
it
to
my
pumpkin
beer
tasting
would
gladly
do
this
one
again
next
year
j
this
is
an
excellent
pumpkin
ale
the
scent
is
so
strong
you
will
convince
yourself
that
a
pumpkin
pie
is
baking
nearby
watch
out
for
the
abv
it
makes
this
one
almost
an
imperial
pumpkin
b
from
the
wife
not
as
good
as
pumking
or
schlaflys
version
the
beer
pours
an
orangishamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
pumpkin
along
with
all
of
the
spices
you
expect
in
a
pumpkin
pie
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
while
all
of
the
spices
are
present
the
ones
that
seem
to
stand
out
the
most
are
cinnamon
and
cloves
all
of
the
spices
meld
nicely
and
create
a
wonderful
pumpkin
ale
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
perhaps
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
ive
yet
had
i
love
the
dogfish
head
punkin
but
this
is
perhaps
even
better
simple
pumpkin
goodness
with
nothing
overdone
lends
itself
to
a
good
drinkability
d
with
this
much
spice
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
it
all
day
the
slight
alcohol
tinge
makes
you
realize
its
a
beer
so
while
its
nice
to
have
one
or
two
id
probably
switch
to
something
else
this
is
an
excellent
pumpkin
beer
and
may
be
my
favorite
this
brewery
is
really
brewing
some
impressive
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
small
head
as
far
as
pumpkin
ale
aromas
go
this
one
is
on
the
extremely
spicy
potpourrilike
end
of
the
spectrum
if
i
were
blindfolded
and
asked
to
smell
it
i
would
not
not
be
able
to
identify
it
as
a
beer
normally
i
would
consider
this
a
major
drawback
but
in
this
case
the
intense
aromas
of
cinnamon
ginger
cloves
pumpkin
and
brown
sugar
are
so
natural
and
enticing
that
i
consider
them
an
asset
the
taste
is
almost
like
a
highly
spiced
cider
like
the
mulled
ciders
we
used
to
drink
when
the
weather
turned
cold
the
unabashed
intensity
of
its
holiday
character
draws
me
in
and
recalls
family
parties
past
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
this
is
a
loveitorhateit
beer
and
i
love
it
only
complaint
is
that
its
too
sweet
for
anything
but
sipping
very
slowly
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
poured
a
full
inch
of
head
that
dissipated
within
30
seconds
color
is
a
medium
brown
with
a
bit
of
cloudiness
that
obscures
anything
behind
the
glass
aroma
is
of
spice
nuts
and
bananas
the
banana
aroma
seems
to
smell
like
a
belgian
yeast
fruity
esters
the
spice
and
banana
notes
let
this
beer
almost
smell
like
fresh
banana
nut
bread
once
you
get
into
the
taste
of
the
beer
the
pumpkin
pulls
through
with
a
pleasant
ghram
cracker
crust
taste
body
is
a
bit
weak
for
pumpkin
pie
but
it
drinks
really
easily
i
think
this
would
pair
very
well
with
a
good
chocolate
brownie
or
some
vanilla
bean
ice
cream
honestly
i
couldnt
imagine
a
better
pumpkin
ale
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
crisp
beer
there
was
some
good
carbonation
which
made
it
very
easy
to
consume
md
just
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
pumpkin
ale
too
much
spice
for
me
i
like
them
smoother
and
not
just
spices
i
guess
drinkability
pretty
good
smooth
beer
medium
body
quite
tastey
iam
not
very
big
on
pumpkin
beers
so
i
really
would
only
have
one
of
these
still
a
good
choice
if
your
going
for
one
drinkability
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tried
this
year
there
is
a
good
balance
between
the
spice
and
the
pumpkin
though
it
does
tend
to
lean
ever
so
slightly
towards
the
spice
it
is
very
refreshing
and
a
downright
tasty
beer
d
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
this
is
quite
simply
hands
down
the
most
perfect
pumpkin
ale
that
has
ever
crossed
my
lips
a
truly
epic
introduction
to
a
brewery
that
i
had
never
heard
of
i
wish
this
werent
a
seasonal
i
would
gladly
drink
this
each
and
every
chance
i
got
this
is
not
just
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
ever
had
its
one
of
the
best
beers
that
ive
ever
had

do
not
seem
to
last
long
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
creamy
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
i
have
ever
had
no
question
a
clear
orangebrownish
body
with
onefinger
head
a
strong
cinnamon
and
peppery
smell
along
with
a
good
pumpkin
aroma
pumpkin
and
bread
malts
are
clearly
evident
along
with
some
caramel
malts
for
sweetness
a
light
body
that
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
finishes
a
little
sharp
as
the
sweetness
is
complementedbalanced
with
some
pepper
and
clove
spices
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
although
the
guy
who
sold
me
on
it
said
it
was
as
good
as
sts
pumpking
not
quite
but
close
overall
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
to
date
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
style
be
sure
to
seek
this
one
out
sixer
from
norms
vienna
va
d
i
tried
this
straight
out
of
the
fermenter
when
i
stopped
by
the
brewery
i
immediately
bought
a
case
off
of
them
as
soon
as
it
was
bottled
i
was
out
with
a
couple
of
friends
in
the
park
and
we
purchased
a
sixpack
of
this
with
solo
cups
from
an
upscale
corner
store
that
recently
opened
by
lincoln
park
we
all
really
liked
this
and
it
went
perfectly
with
an
early
fall
day
and
bocce
ball
as
a
beer
it
was
very
nice
medium
body
not
too
much
head
but
very
pleasant
we
purchased
it
for
the
pumpkin
flavor
though
and
on
that
count
it
was
the
best
ive
had
the
smell
and
flavor
of
pumpkin
and
spices
was
just
right
definitely
there
but
not
completely
overwhelming
the
beer
it
also
did
not
have
the
artificial
taste
if
you
are
a
fan
of
this
flavor
and
not
everyone
is
then
grab
a
six
pack
of
this
and
you
wont
be
dissapointed
not
sure
where
all
of
these
sph
beers
are
coming
from
all
of
a
sudden
but
im
not
one
to
argue
especially
when
a
new
pumpkin
beer
is
involved
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
goldenamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
a
blast
of
thoroughly
sweet
pumpkin
pie
spices
all
of
which
are
undercut
by
a
strong
and
sweet
vein
of
caramel
the
taste
focuses
on
nutmeg
clove
and
brown
sugar
with
the
caramel
being
replaced
by
dried
maple
syrup
draining
the
majority
of
the
sweetness
from
the
proceedings
leaving
only
spice
spice
and
more
spice
without
any
point
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
generally
solid
pumpkin
spice
beer
though
the
heft
of
the
spice
on
the
tongue
relative
to
all
else
will
likely
keep
me
from
reindulging
in
this
during
future
pumpkin
seasons
o
the
addition
of
vanilla
works
well
with
the
spicing
one
of
the
better
pumping
beers
ive
had
this
season
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
of
the
year
so
far
for
me
it
has
vanilla
in
it
which
i
think
is
a
nice
touch
it
sweetens
up
the
squash
a
little
bit
and
makes
the
spices
not
seem
so
dramatic
as
they
sometimes
do
the
color
is
just
right
rusty
amber
and
the
head
holds
on
nicely
the
nose
and
taste
both
show
the
grain
first
and
then
the
spices
and
pumpkin
later
cinnamon
and
vanilla
are
both
doses
perfectly
it
has
some
body
too
it
feels
like
a
fall
beer
and
i
think
is
far
better
than
a
lot
of
the
others
i
experimented
with
this
weekend
my
girlfriend
liked
it
a
lot
too
we
may
end
up
with
a
sixer
of
this
for
the
week
its
really
tasty
decent
deep
pumpkin
color
good
head
and
ok
lacing
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
pie
with
spices
spice
and
pumpkin
blend
togrether
pretty
well
to
make
this
seasonal
ale
balanced
not
too
much
spice
which
is
nice
and
not
too
overpowering
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
seasonal
ales
i
have
had
very
nice
like
pumkingbut
less
abv
would
have
again
to
for
me
the
flavors
are
here
good
soft
nutmeg
roasted
squash
to
give
it
some
pie
crust
flavor
flaky
biscuits
lots
of
vanilla
it
tastes
like
a
good
pumpkin
pie
solid
pumpkin
with
spicy
cinnamon
on
the
aftertaste
however
the
taste
seems
incompatible
with
the
mouthfeel
which
rushes
the
flavor
profile
warming
doesnt
seem
to
take
the
pop
feel
out
of
it
sad
because
it
comes
across
as
good
balanced
pumpkin
pie
flavor
not
too
sweet
with
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
from
the
squash
it
looks
light
feels
light
and
makes
light
of
full
aroma
and
flavor
southampton
pumpkin
would
be
a
good
beer
if
the
flavor
profile
was
missing
the
mineral
water
astringency
and
aspirinlike
bitterness
in
the
finish
maybe
this
could
have
been
masked
with
more
vanilla
or
heavier
spicing
with
so
many
other
great
pumpkin
offerings
it
would
be
hard
to
justify
coming
back
to
this
again
beer
is
mediumlight
to
light
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
leading
to
a
mouthfeel
that
at
first
borders
on
fizziness
but
never
reaches
it
quickly
calming
to
a
fully
foamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
thats
rather
enjoyable

a

side
average
for
pumpkin
beers
o
i
was
really
excited
from
the
smell
but
overall
disappointed
after
that
the
flavor
needed
to
be
heavier
and
with
more
depth
and
i
would
prefer
the
body
to
be
heavier
unfortunately
it
is
another
mediocre
pumpkin
ale
to
add
to
the
list
great
beer
not
crazy
pumpkin
but
self
limiting
clearly
made
by
talented
brewers
who
wanted
to
say
pumpkin
but
not
throw
it
in
your
face
o
a
good
pumpkin
beer
but
nothing
mind
blowing
id
recommend
picking
it
up
and
giving
it
a
try
its
nice
and
mellow
with
a
rustic
pumpkin
flavor
and
not
overly
spiced
nothing
offending
here
could
use
a
little
fuller
flavor
o
my
least
favorite
pumpkin
brew
in
a
long
time
due
mostly
to
a
collection
of
offflavors
and
its
thinness
sorry
to
say
but
this
now
inhabits
the
lower
bound
for
pumpkin
ales
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
beating
out
the
longtime
contender
sam
adams
harvest
pumpkin
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
and
one
that
i
recommend
the
beer
is
certainly
different
than
most
other
ones
on
the
market
and
if
youre
looking
for
one
that
resembles
pumpkin
then
this
is
the
one
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
head
and
some
fair
lacing
nose
is
characteristic
pumpkin
and
fall
spice
harsh
in
its
presentation
but
tastes
like
it
smells
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
o
pretty
disappointed
with
this
i
kind
of
expected
better
from
southampton
o
i
was
rooting
for
this
one
since
i
had
a
friend
tell
me
that
this
was
her
favorite
pumpkin
ale
however
this
missed
the
mark
o
its
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
but
its
not
something
that
wows
me
i
think
it
could
be
a
lot
better
but
its
not
something
i
would
regret
buying
i
would
easily
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
without
a
second
thought
if
you
cant
find
any
other
better
pumpkin
beers
you
wont
be
at
a
disadvantage
drinking
this
its
a
good
enough
beer
that
i
am
going
to
look
for
more
beers
from
this
brewery
to
try
12oz

while
pumpkin

make
for
a

the
whole

seems
more
gimmick
than
true
craft
still
this
is
enjoyable
when
one
is
in
the
mood
during
the
season
unlike
other
seasonal
offerings
for
me
pumpkin
ales
are
only
enjoyable
during
their
season
d
not
bad
it
is
a
pretty
standard
pumpkin
ale
but
a
little
dryer
than
most
might
work
a
little
better
with
a
touch
more
sweetness
overall
this
is
simply
a
pumpkin
ale
as
expected
nothing
memorable
for
a
good
or
bad
reason
a
solid
take
overall
nice
balance
of
spice
malt
and
pumpkin
it
drinks
like
a
beer
and
tastes
like
a
pumpkin
beer
should
its
not
the
best
or
the
boldest
but
sometimes
thats
ok
o
good
pumpkin
beer
worthy
of
a
try
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
flavoring
while
at
times
it
bordered
on
cheapness
the
heavy
spice
more
than
made
up
for
it
that
being
said
things
were
a
bit
onedimensional
and
the
drinker
was
left
wanting
a
bit
more
in
the
way
of
big
aromatics
and
thicker
heartier
feel
and
froth
on
the
lips
overall
nothing
special
i
could
drink
it
but
id
rather
risk
something
i
havent
had
or
go
to
one
of
the
many
other
better
octoberpumpkin
beers
all
in
all
a
mediocre
pumpkin
ale
ive
tasted
better
less
cider
smoother
balance
o
im
pretty
sure
this
was
infected
due
to
the
high
acidity
and
tartness
most
pumpkin
beers
fall
short
of
expecyations
of
a
warming
fall
harvest
brew
that
should
be
roasty
rich
and
have
substance
this
is
yet
another
watered
down
pumpkin
beer
it
had
all
the
flavors
and
the
up
pumpkin
was
the
sure
frontier
but
its
too
thin
this
is

the

the

seems
to

lacking
the

allowing

i
found
the
pumpkin
to
be
well
balanced
with
the
other
spices
for
someone
like
me
who
isnt
the
biggest
fan
of

ended
up
enjoying

being
unsure
on
the
first

sips
poured
a
12

into
a

fuller

bit

toastiness
undereath
the
spice
complimented
it
well
like
to
many
of
the
style
for
me
its
a
little
too
spiced
on
the
palatecinnamonnutmegand
orangelike
cardamom
flavors
over
top
of
a
lightly
toasted
baseits
not
overly
sweet
just
a
bit
over
spiced
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
but
not
something
to
drink
alot
of
because
it
gets
a
bit
to
spiced
in
my
opinion
pours
a
deep
reddish
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
head
which
leaves
some
lines
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
cinnomon
and
pumpkin
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
cinnomon
and
spice
before
a
medium
size
pumpkin
flavor
comes
in
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
good
but
not
over
powering
the
end
there
is
a
very
good
vanilla
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
overall
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
i
enjoyed
this
and
will
seek
it
out
again
do
not
what
i
remember
not
sure
if
this
beer
has
changed
my
taste
has
changed
or
if
i
was
foiled
by
a
sugarrimmed
glass
in
a
great
pub
with
great
friends
a
few
years
back
its
thin
and
watery
and
full
of
more
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
vanilla
extract
than
it
is
pumpkin
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
with
pumpkin
pie
flavors
that
are
not
overbearing
and
a
moderate
abv
enjoyable
and
certainly
a
beer
i
would
have
again
not
overly
sweet
like
some
offerings
in
this
style
overall
its
a
fairly
decent
rendition
that
builds
up
anticipation
with
its
good
looks
and
smell
but
fails
to
deliver
on
whats
initially
expected
instead
leaving
with
you
with
a
good
though
not
great
autumn
beer
soso
pumpkin
beer
almost
lagery
heavyhanded
with
the
pie

many
id
drink
before
this

taste
was
the

cheap

it
was

someone
took
pumpkin

from
a
starbucks
and
sprinkled
it
atop
of
a
natty
light
it
was
this
beers
only
saving
grace
but
it
left
me
highly
disappointed
and
im
hard
to
disappoint
when
it
comes
to
beer
any
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
so
far
has
been
better
pie
ice
cream
very
good
the
addition
of
beer
does
nothing
to
diminish
the
equation
pumpkinhead
is
more
desirable
than
this
and
thats
not
something
that
i
usually
say
check
that
one
out
or
go
for
the
imperials

probably

i
dont
like
pumkin
beers
ordinarily
but
i
have
enjoyed
this
grower
i
would
recommend
this
over
shipyard
or
any
of
the
others
i
tried
o
good
but
not
great
the
spice
flavors
seem
right
but
it
seems
like
its
needingmissing
some
stronger
pumpkin
flavors
well
done
but
not
overdone
i
think
i
just
found
a
new
beer
to
add
to
my
pumpkin
pulled
pork
o
slightly
unimpressed
they
can
do
much
better
and
for
all
i
know
this
is
the
same
run
of
the
mill
pumpkin
beer
that
they
have
been
making
for
10
years
i
think
its
time
to
step
it
up
a
notch
here
and
increase
the
body
ok
could
do
better
o
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
maybe
im
a
little
too
used
to
the
bigger
pumpkin
ales
that
come
out
this
time
of
year
but
i
really
want
a
little
more
spice
presence
in
the
flavor
of
my
pumpkin
ales
nice
drinkability
to
be
sure
though
i
would
have
it
again
if
i
am
craving
a
sessionable
fall
seasonal
o
i
prefer
imperial
pumpkins
so
theres
my
bias
that
said
this
is
an
average
beer
if
you
like
low
abv
vegetal
pumpkin
ales
this
might
be
spoton
for
you
if
you
dont
it
probably
wont
win
you
over
doverall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
its
supposed
to
be
a
pumpkin
beer
and
i
feel
like
this
is
a
watered
down
version
of
one
no
off
flavors
in
this
just
not
enough
good
flavors
to
make
me
get
another
glass
its
still
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
not
one
ill
be
reaching
for
again
next
october
o
great
pumpkin
ale
very
well
balanced
pumpkin
isnt
drowned
out
like
a
lot
of
pumpkin
ales
for
better
or
worse
i
think
this
is
it
for
me
and
pumpkins
this
year
pours
orangey
amber
with
slight
haze
decent
sized
head
recedes
immediately
with
little
trace
and
no
lace
smells
good
pumpkin
pie
spices
good
malt
character
and
trace
of
the
vanilla
extract
tastes
like
a
good
pumpkin
beer
im
picking
up
some
pilsen
malt
a
nice
honeygrainy
character
good
pumpkin
stuff
out
of
southampton
enjoyed
thoroughly
d
very
drinkable
could
be
a
great
fall
session
beer
the
feel
is
a
little
too
thin
high
carbonation
so
it
feels
lighter
on
the
palate
medium
body
pretty
high
carbonation
prickly
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
not
bad
for
a
pumpkin
beer
captures
the
spice
and
season
without
turning
into
an
overspiced
or
oversweet
mess
overall
a
unique
pumpkin
beer
drinkable
but
has
a
unique
smelltaste
that
i
just
cant
place
different
than
any
other
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
out
of
the
bottle
it
has
a
copper
color
with
a
slight
tannish
foam
head
that
leave
a
descent
amount
of
lacing
mild
cinnamon
scent
to
it
do
one
of
along
with
dfhs
punkin
the
most
balanced
pumpkin
ales
available
the
spices
never
become
overpowering
and
sweetness
is
nowhere
near
as
cloying
as
some
of
the
imperial
versions
of
this
style
that
being
said
i
still
couldnt
have
more
than
two
of
these
in
one
sitting
if
you
enjoy
a
more
balanced
pumpkin
definitely
give
this
beer
a
try
recommended
cheers
authentic
aromas
easy
to
drink
and
with
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
spice
all
lead
to
this
being
a
winner
not
my
favorite
but
one
that
id
recommend
nonetheless
o
i
have
been
making
a
tour
of
pumpkin
beers
of
late
southamptons
beer
is
enjoyable
but
it
is
not
complex
there
is
some
nice
pumpkin
a
bit
of
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
some
zing
from
the
carbonation
if
you
prefer
to
taste
more
spice
in
your
pumpkin
beer
you
will
not
find
it
here
instead
you
should
expect
more
roasted
pumpkin
notes
this
beer
was
tasted
on
a
late
september
night
out
of
a
bottle
i
found
this
beer
more
dark
and
deep
in
color
than
your
average
pumpkin
beer
there
was
a
strong
presence
of
spices
such
as
cloves
and
cinnamon
rendering
this
beer
more
like
pumpkin
pie
as
opposed
to
natural
pumpkin
on
the
negative
side
there
seems
to
be
more
of
a
artificial
taste
to
this
pours
a
deep
burnt
orange
almost
brown
in
appearance
the
nose
is
more
vanilla
and
nutmeg
than
pumpkin
taste
is
the
same
not
very
much
pumpkin
but
rather
the
spices
that
one
may
put
into
a
pumpkin
pie
unlike
some
bas
i
do
not
mind
pie
spice
in
my
pumpkin
beer
but
there
needs
to
be
pumpkin
in
it
to
balance
the
spices
this
is
lacking
here
this
beer
also
had
an
oddly
acidic
finish
that
was
not
terribly
pleasant
o
the
head
and
lacing
was
disappointing
the
flavor
was
lacking
solid
malt
backbone
and
hops
that
the
smuttynose
had
the
mouthfeel
was
also
not
as
smooth
or
thick
as
i
would
have
liked
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
disappointing
particularly
after
having
at
least
3
fine
2011
pumpkin
ales
from
other
brewers
overall
average
fall
pumpkin
moreys
bottom
line
the
color
is
beautiful
but
the
lack
of
a
headlacing
is
hard
to
ignore
im
glad
that
i
decided
to
purchase
only
a
single
bottle
as
opposed
to
an
entire
6
pack
really
nice
pumpkin
ale
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
amber
color
with
a
fizzy
white
looking
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
decent
amount
of
autumn
spice
on
the
nose
the
flavor
of
the
beer
was
spicy
upfront
and
then
faded
into
a
sweet
caramel
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
plenty
of
carbonation
to
it
and
a
nice
medium
body
also
overall
this
brew
is
pretty
good
its
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
brew
but
not
a
bad
one
at
least
o
i
typically
enjoy
the
pumpkin
pie
variety
of
pumpkin
ales
this
one
is
nice
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
spice
department
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
malty
chilly
night
brew
with
some
spice
notes
this
one
isnt
bad
pours
a
nice
amberorange
with
at
least
two
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
and
taste
are
both
relatively
subtle
and
not
overpowering
pumpkin
leads
the
way
with
a
good
amount
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
behind
it
a
long
with
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
theres
also
a
bready
touch
from
the
malts
which
give
the
impression
of
a
nice
amber
base
beer
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
nothing
in
this
beer
is
over
the
top
or
in
your
face
it
retains
a
lot
of
the
base
beers
characters
and
never
gets
too
heavy
or
sweet
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
o
a
great
rendition
of
a
pumpkin
ale
and
one
ill
definitely
pick
up
again
big
fall
spices
with
pumpkoin
and
malt
flavor
throughout
it
has
more
of
a
presence
of
a
lager
with
lower
carbonation
to
be
honest
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
though
m
smooth
and
spicy
nice
dry
finish
medium
coating
to
palate
bright
acidity
with
medium
carbonation
finish
is
nice
and
spicy
with
a
great
lingering
spicy
flavor
this
beer
looks
like
a
pumpkin
ale
and
smells
like
a
pumpkin
ale
but
the
taste
is
way
off
there
is
some
spices
there
but
i
cannot
get
past
this
vegetative
quality
it
tastes
like
beef
vegetable
soup
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
for
me
the
taste
is
not
good
they
may
have
tried
to
use
the
pumpkin
too
much
and
not
enough
spice
to
back
it
up
nice
looking
brew
pours
an
oktoberfestlike
colour
orangeish
and
coppery
not
a
huge
head
some
tracing
down
the
glass
scents
of
floral
pumpkin
nutmeg
cinnamon
etc
tastes
a
lot
like
the
scent
but
could
use
a
bit
more
pumpkin
spice
a
bit
thin
very
enjoyable
however
and
easy
to
drink
very
easy
to
drink
nothing
offensive
and
not
sweet
like
some
pumpkins
can
be
the
scent
of
this
beer
being
remarkable
and
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
pumpkin
ales
but
definitely
worth
a
shot
the
taste
is
as
close
to
drinking
pumpkin
pie
as
you
can
get
i
have
tried
every
pumpkin
ale
i
could
find
this
is
by
far
the
closest
to
what
i
would
like
in
a
pumpkin
beer
poured
a
hazy
medium
orangebrown
with
and
average
sized
off
white
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
and
had
poor
lacing
the
aroma
was
heavy
of
cookie
malts
and
a
sweet
yeast
with
strong
notes
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
it
tasted
slightly
bittersweet
at
first
but
ended
with
a
really
nice
bittersweetmalty
flavor
with
nice
hints
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
that
was
left
lingering
on
the
tastebuds
for
a
really
nice
long
while
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
kind
of
watery
in
texture
yet
nice
and
creamy
on
the
back
end
overall
a
very
nice
tasting
pumpkin
ale
that
left
me
wanting
a
slice
of
pie
i
look
forward
to
returning
to
pa
to
try
something
else
from
southampton
notes
in
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
well
made
and
well
balanced
pumpkin
ale
d
enjoyed
this
one
not
a
string
pumpkin
taste
the
bottle
says
brewed
with
pumpkin
d
i
prefered
this
one
and
would
recommend
it
as
a
starter
for
hoilday
beer
dont
think
i
could
it
in
the
summer
but
that
fll
or
winter
day
anytime
good
pumpkin
but
not
the
great
pumpkin
very
drinkable
all
autumn
long
and
into
the
winter
d
id
skip
it
pours
hazy
amber
with
a
small
dense
sticky
and
lacy
head
the
aroma
is
good
strong
and
cinammony
the
flavor
however
is
flat
and
spicy
with
a
disappointing
lack
of
sparkle
or
vibrancy
the
spice
is
dull
and
heavy
and
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
dry
very
disappointing
this
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
large
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
dissipates
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
most
definitely
pumpkin
but
also
with
some
lighter
malts
present
maybe
munichvienna
the
taste
mirrors
the
aroma
to
a
large
degree
the
pumpkin
spice
comes
across
well
not
too
in
your
face
but
enough
that
you
can
taste
it
easily
especially
in
the
after
taste
this
beer
has
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
but
still
feels
like
its
able
to
coat
your
mouth
with
its
pumpkin
flavor
while
this
beer
is
tasty
its
such
a
specific
flavor
that
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
and
even
then
only
in
the
right
season
overall
though
a
pretty
good
beer
the
body
is
medium
to
light
with
abundant
carbonation
the
feel
is
slick
throughout
until
the
finish
where
it
dries
out
very
drinkable
with
abundant
satisfying
flavors
touche
pours
a
nice
moderate
orange
color
with
a
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
forward
some
sweet
pumpkin
as
well
as
cinnamon
clove
allspice
and
a
little
bit
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
sweet
pumpkin
and
light
brown
sugar
as
well
as
a
good
dose
of
spicing
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
drinks
really
quite
well
for
what
it
is
dm
subtle
carbonation
that
helps
bring
out
the
aromas
it
is
very
balanced
with
the
amount
of
alcohol
and
really
does
not
overwhelm
great
to
enjoy
a
few
of
these
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
as
noted
above
the
malt
profile
is
way
more
forward
than
the
spices
in
this
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
wish
it
was
available
in
my
area
thanks
boglehill
for
the
chance
to
try
this
i
can
say
this
was
my
least
favorite
pumpkin
ale
of
2010
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
very
good
retention
and
a
bit
of
laceing
aroma
is
of
pumpkinspices
and
brown
sugar
medium
bodiedcrisp
and
carbonated
taste
is
of
pumpkin
with
hints
of
dark
fruits
spicy
through
out
very
nice
flavor
is
malty
and
dry
some
cinnamon
in
the
back
end
and
toasted
pumpkin
flavors
up
front
its
fairly
transitory
and
doesnt
linger
long
on
the
palate
feel
is
a
little
seltzer
like
and
plain
some
maltiness
lingers
with
spartan
touches
of
squash
and
cinnamon
overall
its
very
clean
dry
and
utilitarian
not
a
spice
bomb
thankfully
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
oomph
to
it
also
it
may
be
my
nutmeg
bias
but
the
heavy
reliance
on
it
was
this
beers
downfall
for
me
i
dont
feel
it
brings
a
lot
more
to
the
table
not
for
me
thanks
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
that
im
enjoying
sipping
and
would
be
fine
with
having
another
which
is
not
always
true
with
pumpkin
ales
even
when
i
enjoy
them
i
certainly
would
not
mind
having
this
one
again
in
the
future
i
thought
this
a
very
good
beer
in
that
it
shows
off
both
the
spices
and
a
touch
of
hops
md
medium
bodied
with
a
little
but
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
it
sort
of
had
a
soda
like
texture
to
it
not
bad
but
certainly
not
great
would
pass
for
other
pumpkin
beers
dthis
beer
has
good
overall
combination
of
flavors
and
aromas
that
welcome
you
in
and
invite
you
to
have
more
than
just
one
i
felt
lucky
to
have
been
able
to
go
to
the
publick
house
while
the
pumpkin
ale
was
one
tap
i
may
even
make
the
1
5
hour
drive
back
to
southampton
just
to
pick
up
a
growler
best
part
of
drinking
the
pumpkin
ale
was
the
rich
and
delightful
aftertaste
that
reminded
me
of
thanksgiving
pumpkin
pie
d
very
enjoyable
to
drink
not
a
beer
that
should
be
pounded
pours

poof

scent
is
light
yet
notes

first
sip
is

well
balanced
notes
of
nutmeg
cinamon
and
clove
with
a
good
solid
pumpkin
background
medium
bodied
slightly
creamy
well
balanced
between
pumpkin

and
fall

no

very
drinkable
a
good
all
around
pumpkin
for
all

d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
ive
noticed
2
types
of
pumpkin
beers
ones
that
taste
mostly
like
a
pumpkin
and
those
that
taste
like
pie
i
do
like
the
spicy
pie
beers
myself
and
this
one
is
a
great
one
hazy
deep
amber
with
a
thin
cream
colored
head
that
seemed
to
stick
around
a
mild
pumpkin
aroma
with
some
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
a
delicate
spiciness
along
with
a
toasty
caramel
maltiness
vanilla
and
fruit
flavor
is
of
slight
pumpkin
pumpkin
spice
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
though
the
spice
and
malt
are
present
it
is
generally
clean
with
a
nice
hop
bite
rounding
out
the
finish
this
one
reminds
me
of
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
delicious
drinkability
the
bottle
describes
this
beer
as
not
wanting
to
be
over
the
top
this
beer
starts
with
a
bang
really
sweet
but
fades
just
as
quick
with
the
light
spicing
the
beer
becomes
bland
as
the
spices
fade
too
quickly
and
what
is
left
is
a
light
marzen
beer
i
think
with
some
tweaking
this
has
potential
to
be
really
good
however
i
have
had
better
from
the
brewery
and
in
the
style
i
would
pass
on
this
in
the
future
clear
medium
amber
in
colour
with
an
offwhite
cap
it
definitely
smells
like
a
pumpkin
ale
pleasant
spices
nutmeg
and
allspice
cinnamon
malty
sweetness
and
earthy
gourd
quite
nice
the
flavour
was
good
but
it
could
have
used
a
bit
of
extra
malt
to
the
fill
out
the
flavour
a
bit
more
biscuity
perhaps
solid
lingering
bitterness
beneath
the
pumpkin
and
spices
more
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
decent
texture
too
medium
to
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
i
liked
this
beer
and
appreciate
the
flavour
of
pumpkin
spices
rather
than
spices
on
their
own
overall
i
can
drink
it
particularly
when
a
little
warmer
but
i
dont
want
a
bunch
of
them
i

the
difference
is
drinkability
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
though
rather
bland
in
terms
of
complexity
a
good
session
beer
to
have
though
as
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
but
is
still
intriguing
enough
to
peak
some
interest

note
i
dont
think
the
guy
in
the
beer
store
was
lying
to
me
about
the
freshness
of
this
beer
but
a
bomber
was
more
than
enough
for
me
part
of
this
is
just
the
style
however
its
a
hard
one
to
get
just
right
in
my
opinion
moderate
to
high
carbonation
giving
it
a
fizzy
mouthfeel
thats
not
bad
but
might
have
been
better
without
the
finish
is
fruity
sweet
grains
this
is
not
the
case
but
look
at
the
scores
hmm
seems
like
another
case
of
starstruck
fans
of
the
brand

544overall
by
other
brewers
i
am
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
so
this
is
why
the
drinkability
is
a
little
lower
stimackoct
25
this
is
perfect
for
the
season
im
a
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
around
this
time
md
the
only
downside
is
that
its
a
little
bit
overspiced
it
leaves
that
grainy
feel
on
my
tongue
like
when
i
have
cinnamon
on
something
but
it
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
ever
had
very
tasty
even
the
girlfriend
liked
it
and
she
swears
all
beer
tastes
the
same
dark
copper
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
head
disappears
rather
quickly
some
spices
mostly
nutmeg
in
the
nose
slightly
bready
malt
character
some
pumpkin
pie
spices
at
the
end
along
with
some
bitterness
finishes
dry
light
body
rather
simple
with
a
nice
spicy
finish
not
bad
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
overall
compared
to
other
pumpkin
ales
i
found
that
the
southampton
holds
up
extremely
well
it
neither
overdoes
the
spice
as
the
weyerbacher
does
nor
is
it
oversweet
and
overdone
like
dogfish
head
nor
is
it
too
understated
like
the
smuttynose
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
probably
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
after
trying
their
outstanding
double
white
ale
im
always
optimistic
when
trying
a
new
beer
from
southampton
and
this
one
didnt
disappoint
one
of
the
more
solid
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
this
season
its
subdued
with
a
more
balanced
spice
profile
they
arent
too
rich
nor
are
they
too
mild
and
overall
the
entire
palate
is
just
a
little
more
drinkable
and
easy
going
now
if
you
really
like
pumpkin
ales
and
enjoy
the
richer
examples
of
the
style
you
might
consider
this
one
a
little
watery
but
personally
i
really
enjoyed
southamptons
aboveaverage
stab
at
the
style
recommended
overall
this
was
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
to
date
d
i
really
like
the
offerings
from
southampton
and
this
is
no
exception
another
pretty
stellar
brew
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
alesnot
to
be
confused
with
an
ofest
drinkability
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
but
again
ive
had
very
few
beers
of
this
style
now
i
know
why
i
havent
had
many
it
made
for
a
nice
fall
season
brew
but
maybe
i
should
buy
another
bottle
and
see
if
another
one
tastes
like
this
i
sure
hope
it
has
more
pumpkin
taste
than
this
bottle
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
accompanies
loads
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
which
dominate
the
landscape
in
this
pumpkin
pie
melange
pumpkin
is
present
in
notable
quantities
with
their
sweetness
peaking
by
midsip
finish
is
surprisingly
bitter
with
a
burst
of
hops
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
a
very
tasty
pumpkin
worth
the
cost
of
admission
drinkability
is
excellent
the
flavors
are
very
balanced
something
hard
to
find
in
a
pumpkin
ale
im
glad
that
i
purchased
a
case
of
this
and
another
may
be
in
order
for
thanksgiving
because
this
one
will
not
last
drinkability

this
is
neck
and
neck
with
the
smutty
pumpkin
for
me

i
may
like
this
a
bit
more
ill
have
to
drink
a
few
more
of
these
overall
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
perhaps
the
best
one
i
have
had
up
to
date
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
some
of
the
other
pumpkin
beers
out
there
i
think
there
is
a
time
and
a
place
for
some
of
those
phenomenal
imperial
pumpkin
beers
but
this
is
a
nice
one
to
enjoy
with
friends
tastes
great
but
doesnt
require
you
to
sit
and
contemplate
on
it
think
of
it
as
a
pumpkin
session
beer
thick
medium
carbonated
mouthfeel
leaves
a
dry
moderate
finish
easy
drinking
and
delicious
sampled
at
the
blind
tiger
in
nyc
on
cask
then
at
the
brewery
on
draught
then
at
spuyten
duyvil
on
cask
then
at
barcade
on
draught
fun
beer
and
without
a
doubt
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ever
although
i
still
havent
had
kuhnhenns
version
light
golden
color
a
bit
lighter
than
most
pumpkin
ales
nice
aromatically
considering
it
is
a
pumpkin
ale
authentic
pumpkin
aromas
with
light
cinnamon
and
allspice
flavor
is
heavily
pumpkin
accented
with
very
little
spice
cinnamon
and
allspice
loaded
just
loaded
with
pumpkin
flavor
although
ill
be
honest
and
say
i
was
hoping
for
something
just
a
little
more
substancial
and
of
course
i
loved
the
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
overall
a
great
brew
but
an
outstanding
brewery
my
aggro
pour
created
two
fluffy
fingers
of
tawny
head
with
good
retention
that
began
to
create
nice
lacing
as
it
fell
color
was
a
coppery
amber
srm
13
with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
just
like
pumpkin
pie
the
cinnamon
was
prevalent
but
the
vanilla
was
also
present
and
the
other
spices
stood
in
line
behind
those
two
in
looking
at
my
cask
review
the
clove
was
in
this
version
but
not
as
prevalent
nor
was
the
mouthfeel
as
full
and
soft
this
had
a
creaminess
but
the
carbonation
was
more
prickly
on
the
tongue
finish
was
tasty
and
it
was
probably
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
that
i
have
had
from
a
bottle
but
it
did
not
measure
up
to
the
cask
version
i
am
now
curious
to
try
and
find
it
on
a
draft
account
damn
this
was
a
good
beer
wow
what
a
shock
sarcasm
another
great
beer
from
southampton
beer
is
good
happy
beering
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
fairly
delicate
at
the
start
but
it
comes
out
more
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
really
spice
things
up
there
are
some
small
hints
of
sweetness
to
add
to
the
complex
array
of
flavors
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
i
did
not
want
to
share
this
one
but
after
trying
it
i
had
to
let
a
few
people
have
a
sip
they
then
ordered
one
for
themselves
it
is
a
very
good
drinker
as
well
they
did
an
excellent
job
on
this
one
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
i
did
a
taste
test
over
thanksgiving
with
around
25
different
pumpkin
beers
and
this
was
one
of
the
ones
on
the
top
probably
amongst
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
just
not
a
big
pumpkin
beer
fan
pours
an
amber
hue
with
a
translucent
clarity
nose
expresses
nutmeg
clove
peppery
notes
and
a
hint
of
ethanol
taste
consistent
with
nose
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
that
the
spice
profile
is
not
in
your
face
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
an
even
carbonation
and
a
slight
acidity
overall
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
generally
not
a
style
in
my
wheelhouse
however
i
enjoyed
this
one
definitely
in
my
top
three
for
the
style
thus
far
poured
into
a
sniffer
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
big
aromas
of
pumpkin
and
spices
mellow
but
present
pumpkin
flavor
but
most
of
the
taste
comes
from
a
myriad
of
spices
even
gives
off
the
flavor
of
being
bourbon
barrel
aged
and
is
rather
alcoholic
this
beer
could
use
some
aging
to
allow
some
more
flavors
to
open
up
like
most
pumpkin
beers
in
my
opinion
nevertheless
this
is
probably
my
second
favorite
pumpkin
beer
of
all
time
and
i
thouroughly
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
tons
of
natural
pumpkin
flavor
initially
with
the
spices
becoming
more
dominant
as
the
beer
warms
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
that
ive
had
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
orangishred
color
with
offwhite
head
pumpkin
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
caramel
and
malt
on
the
nose
follows
onto
the
palate
finishes
like
a
nice
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
tastes
like
real
pumpkins
and
pie
really
nice
viscous
mouth
feel
not
too
sweet
this
is
really
good
likely
the
best
pumpkin
i
had
it
has
a
superior
balance
and
it
is
more
elegant
than
other
counterparties
with
good
spices
complexity
overall
a
wellbalanced
pumpkin
ale
that
highlights
both
sweet
and
spicy
aspects
of
style
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
better
than
many
pumpkin
seasonals
ive
had
copper
with
ruby
tones
and
an
off
white
head
that
fades
to
a
small
ring
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
if
any
a
bit
flat
looking
but
i
experience
this
with
the
style
caramel
graham
crusty
malt
gord
meatcinnamon
nutmeg
clove
and
do
i
detect
a
hint
of
cream
starts
off
with
a
nice
vegetal
gord
meat
flavor
that
is
wrapped
in
caramel
and
graham
flavors
the
spice
weaves
in
early
bringing
a
perfect
level
of
cinnamon
clove
and
nutmeg
spiciness
lower
carbonation
and
the
body
feels
slightly
thin
overall
its
a
great
pumpkin
ale
its
top
two
for
me
next
to

22oz
bomber
pours
deep
amber
orange
1
finger
of
head
dissipates
quickly
aromas
of

cinnamon
all
spice
nutmeg
sugar
tastes
like
a
good
pumpkin
pie
less
sweet
than
alewerks
but
still
very
good
and
smooth
easy
to
drink
same
flavors
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
way
down
very
solid
pumpkin
beer
perfect
for
football
season
and
thanksgiving
overall
i
might
have
a
new
favorite
pumpkin
ale
the
flavor
tends
strongly
to
the
creamy
pumpkin
sweetness
almost
like
the
whipped
cream
on
top
of
the
pie
was
included
there
is
little
to
no
spiciness
that
i
can
tell
and
nothing
in
the
way
of
malty
pie
crust
but
mostly
the
pumpkin
pie
filling
probably
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
they
are
too
proud
of
it
though
o
the
key
to
any
great
beer
is
balance
and
this
beer
has
it
the
pumpkin
and
the
splices
are
well
matched
to
the
beer
nothing
is
overpowering
delicious
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
tasted
in
2014
o
of
all
the
harvestpumpkin
beers
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
ive
had
the
creaminess
from
the
nitro
puts
it
over
the
top
brown
sugar
cinnamon
nutmeg
some
nuttiness
the
aroma
is
lovely
however
the
flavor
wasnt
as
well
integrated
as
i
had
hoped
a
little
too
overwhelmingly
spicy
but
still
enjoyable
no
bitterness
or
whimlike
ingredients
to
see
what
happens
this
was
tested
and
approved
unanimously
over
and
over
and
over
and
over
again
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
being
made
today
ive
had
this
on
nitro
at
the
brewery
and
also
from
the
bottle
nitro
gives
it
a
bit
better
mouthfeel
but
overall
they
both
pack
a
lot
of
spices
and
pumpkin
flavor
without
taking
away
from
the
beer
one
of
the
only
pumpkin
brews
that
i
see
out
annually
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pumpkin
ale
it
is
not
a
sickly
sweet
pumpkin
pie
ale
the
spices
although
prominent
are
not
over
powering
i
highly
recommend
1000th
rating
of
good

great
beer
this
is
a

pumpkin
beer
the
beer
pours

with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
the
nose
is
spice
forward
but
not
distinctly
pumpkin
pielike
instead
it
has
a
slightly
cinnamon
and
bubble

aroma
the
taste
has
a
similar
bubble
gummyplastic
spice
presence
which
dominates
the
sweet

base
and
leaves
little
room
for
other
expected
pumpkin

flavors
i
e
caramelized

by
a
mediumheavy
bodied
boozy
punishing
spice
bomb
its
reasonably
carbonated
and
sweet
this
is
a
distinct
and
different
kind
of
pumpkin
ale
but
the
dominating
bubble
gummy
spice
profile
is
off
putting
very
good
beer
i
wont
do
the
breakdown
because
i
tried
one
week
ago
it
was
very
complex
and
not
overdone
i
loved
this
brew
cigar
city
rarely
disappoints
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
pumpkin
beer
not
artificial
tasting
nice
pumpkinspice
balance
and
super
tasty
seek
it
out
the
spice
flavors
are
pretty
nice
but
a
little
over
the
top
for
me
not
usually
a
fan
of
higher
abv
pumpkin
ales
but
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
i
remember
o
its
ok
a
bit
disappointing
i
dont
particularly
gravitate
towards
pumpkin
beers
and
with
that
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
one
again

sorry
pumking
this
is
the
true
king
of
pumpkin
ales
smell
is
obviously
of
pumpkin
allspice
and
cinnamon
for
8
5
i
got
little
to
no
alcohol
burn
on
the
back
the
quintessential
beer
to
celebrate
autumn
delicious
highly
recommended
brew
from
cigar
city
2013
bottle
poured
into
a
white
wine
glass
smells
like
fresh
pumpkin
pie
good
mouthfeel
full
but
not
heavy
plenty
of
spice
but
good
balance
with
the
pumpkin
neither
one
dominates
the
other
this
was
good
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
perfect
for
thanksgiving
dinner
or
special
fall
dinners
probably
not
something
i
would
drink
on
a
random
tuesday
night
pours
a
dark
amber
color
but
translucent
when
held
up
to
light
light
but
noticeable
carbonation
cloves
pumpkin
and
brandy
on
the
nose
taste
is
boozy
pumkin
allspice
cloves
cinnamon
and
candy
corn
in
a
perfect
combination
delicious
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
nice
spice
notes
yet
still
very
smooth
at
the
same
time
sweetness
was
spot
on
not
too
much
or
too
little
fabulous
beer
best
pumpkin
beer
hands
down
like
liquid
pumpkin
with
perfect
balance
of
alcohol
oa
wellmade
pumpkin
beer
with
great
flavor
and
not
overly
sweetened
as
many
of
this
style
are
probably
my
favorite
of
the
style
d
really
well
done
and
quite
enjoyable
you
get
the
pumpkin
and
the
spice
in
great
balance
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
pumpkin
beers
but
this
is
what
i
imagine
one
should
be
like
o
overall
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
while
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
ever
it
is
in
the
mix
with
the
top
ones
out
there
for
sure
easy
to
drink
and
the
taste
was
great
i
think
i
like
schlaflys
pumpkin
ale
the
best
followed
by
elysian
the
great
pumpkin
this
pumking
and
alewerks
pumpkin
ale
all
slightly
under
it
well
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
the
style
full
bodied
for
the
style
with
a
nice
balance
of
pumpkin
pie
sweetness
and
earthy
zesty
spice
notes
strong
organic
tasting
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
puréepie
filling
up
front
with
prominent
nutmeg
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
allspice
countered
by
a
more
musty
rustic
spice
profile
that
has
hints
of
peppery
clove
ginger
cinnamon
and
cardamom
theres
a
nice
malt
backbone
giving
off
more
sweetness
with
hints
of
caramel
toffee
toast
and
biscuit
slight
boozy
sweetness
in
the
finish
but
there
is
no
heat
at
all
drinks
incredibly
well
for
8
5
in
addition
to
the
complexity
there
is
incredible
balance
the
spice
presence
is
really
strong
taming
the
pumpkin
piedessert
sweetness
and
theres
just
enough
sweet
malt
and
pumpkin
character
preventing
it
from
feeling
overwhelmingly
spicy
i
can
see
how
this
could
be
a
bit
too
much
for
some
but
i
think
its
a
great
take
on
the
style
one
of
the
better
examples
of
what
a
pumpkin
beer
can
be
overall
i
think
this
might
be
the
perfect
pumpkin
beer
for
me
at
least
delicious
spices
the
right
amount
of
pumpkinness
right
amount
of
sweet
just
really
delicious
this
was
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
thanksgiving
see
you
again
next
year
good
gourd
i
might
have
a
new
favorite
pumpkin
beer
here
rich
sweet
smooth
and
utterly
drinkable
its
certainly
not
often
that
i
go
through
a
750
so
quickly
and
easily
on
my
own
this
is
one
definately
worth
seeking
i
cant
wait
to
try
almighty
a
very
solid
if
slightly
overdone
pumpkin
beer
got
to
be
the
smoothest
pumpkin
beer
ever
been
mellowing
for
a
year
now
bronze
and
lazy
in
looks
but
angry
and
temperamental
and
impatient
in
taste
so
much
here
all
orange
and
frothy
nose
of
gourd
its
true
cinnamon
clove
ginger
turmeric
and
all
kinds
of
liquor
smooth
and
comfortably
spiced
this
is
a
beer
of
sharing
proportions
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
cardamom
so
much
going
on
here
but
so
little
comprehension
for
me
as
i
sip
away
tasting
something
new
each
time
barrel
and
attitude
percolate
heavy
as
does
a
soft
sort
of
pokey
vibe
spice
is
robust
yet
i
am
as
mellow
as
anything
delicate
feel
needs
more
oomph
overall
but
this
is
special
stuff
the
name
gourd
makes
me
want
more
gourds
its
reciprocal
in
that
way
special
yet
understated
impress
me
it
does
perfect
it
is
not
this
really
represents
a
perfect
pumpkin
pie
in
a
beer
pumking
does
a
good
job
but
is
a
bit
cloying
on
the
sweetness
this
has
the
perfect
balance
that
really
makes
this
the
best
pumpkin
beer
out
there
o
id
be
surprised
if
you
did
a
blind
taste
test
of
this
and
didnt
pick
out
each
flavor
i
listed
they
are
all
there
and
so
prominent
yet
in
perfect
harmony
ccb
went
over
the
top
with
this
beer
my
new
favorite
fall
release
thankfully
i
have
friends
willing
to
send
me
bottles
of
this
d
o
if
you
distilled
fall
had
your
grandmother
bake
it
into
a
pie
and
then
brewed
a
beer
with
it
this
would
be
that
beer
oh
the
epiphany
where
have
you
been
every
fall
for
the
last
7
years
dear
good
gourd
out
of
distribution
sadly
but
thanks
to
kayaksandbeer
my
clutch
trading
partner
i
can
now
imbibe
in
what
i
consider
the
perfect
pumpkin
beer
all
others
have
been
warned
this
is
legit
a
remarkably
good
pumpkin
beer
really
great
balance
liquefied
pumpkin
pie
vanilla
creme
yam
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
other
autumnal
spices
nice
touch
of
warmth
from
the
booze
pie
crust
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
one
wish
i
had
access
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
then
definitely
try
it
out
to
me
i
have
yet
to
taste
s
better
pumpkin
beer
overall
this
is
a
big
sweet
syrupy
beer
and
i
love
it
the
huge
pumpkinclove
sweetness
and
dry
finish
makes
this
a
winner
for
me
ive
found
my
new
favorite
pumpkin
beer
wow
big
and
boozy
pumpkin
beer
strong
nutmeg
cinnamon
notes
slightly
thin
tasting
so
sweet
no
real
character
develops
big
time
boozy
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
a
fat
tuesday
drink
that
tastes
like
a
dessert
and
then
you
swallow
and
say
damn
there
was
a
ton
of
alcohol
in
that
thing
glad
i
tried
it
wouldnt
seek
out
again
overall
this
is
something
id
like
to
share
with
someone
not
something
to
drink
yourself
it
holds
well
over
night
i
opened
it
the
first
night
did
not
finish
it
put
a
wine
cork
in
reopened
it
the
next
day
and
it
tasted
fine
overall
wow
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
i
dont
love
pumpkin
beers
but
this
is
just
great
i
would
expect
no
less
from
ccb
and
this
certainly
delivers
wow
this
is
really
amazing
tastes
like
someone
put
some
cool
whip
apple
pie
pumpkin
pie
and
a
few
cones
of
hops
in
a
blender
with
maybe
a
few
shots
of
whipped
vodka
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
velvety
very
nice
obeautiful
beer
ccb
has
not
made
anything
that
i
dont
like
this
is
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
beer
in
the
world
amazing
a
smell
is
not
exciting
but
the
taste
more
than
makes
up
for
this
the
mouthfeel
is
sooo
good
this
beer
has
taken
the
place
as
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
this
is
coming
from
someone
who
gets
schlaflys
pumpkin
beer
on
a
regular
basis
pours
a
glowing
deep
amber
hue
glowing
edges
with
some
sunfire
well
hazed
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
that
laces
ok
a
decent
sized
ring
aromas
are
crisp
toast
and
caramel
vanilla
and
toffee
biscuits
and
pumpkin
puree
a
bit
sweeter
with
decent
pie
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
more
vanilla
caramel
some
crispness
initial
is
medium
bodied
offering
a
touch
more
sweetness
vanilla
and
caramel
blast
toffee
and
toast
gentle
spice
moves
in
with
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
toffee
and
biscuits
more
pie
spices
and
pumpkin
puree
sweeter
with
caramelized
malts
touches
of
sweetness
dance
with
just
a
hint
of
dryness
fairly
balanced
for
a
sweeter
beer
spice
and
vanilla
sweet
malts
finish
is
nice
gentle
spice
and
sweetness
linger
its
not
complex
but
its
tasty
sweet
slanted
without
being
anywhere
near
cloying
fairly
balanced
very
nice
i
love
when
asked
what
this
beer
will
likely
pair
well
with
as
they
likely
expect
desserts
like
pumpkin
pie
i
enjoy
explaining
that
it
doesnt
pair
with
dessert
it
replaces
the
dessert
probably
the
best
pumpkin
beer
out
there
i
reserve
my
final
judgment
as
i
havent
tried
all
the
amazing
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
deserves
the
1
spot
for
pumpkin
beers
that
its
got
right
now
ccb
i
love
you
guys
and
keep
up
the
great
work
o
in
a
sea
of
pumpkin
beers
released
all
too
early
good
gourd
stands
head
and
shoulders
above
the
crowd
with
a
wonderful
familiarity
like
that
pie
your
aunt
always
brings
to
thanksgiving
but
this
time
its
tweaked
cigar
citys
use
of
intercontinental
spice
gives
good
gourd
a
truly
oneofakind
aroma
and
flavor
if
you
can
get
it
make
this
the
one
musttry
pumpkin
beer
of
the
season
the
beer
is
copper
to
amber
hued
with
a
quarter
inch
of
off
white
head
crimson
highlights
in
the
body
the
aroma
brings
cinnamon
pumpkin
pie
pie
filling
sugar
while
cream
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
smooth
malty
body
a
touch
of
alcohol
warmth
in
the
finish
really
solid
splitting
the
bottle
a
few
ways
is
probably
best
o
favorite
pumpkin
beer
and
i
have
had
many
saw
some
people
mixing
it
with
zhukovs
the
other
night
interesting
but
i
love
both
just
alone
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
small
head
smell
is
big
on
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
taste
is
identical
amazing
flavor
and
perhaps
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
tried
lingering
pumpkin
taste
love
it
thoroughly
recommended
overall
i
think
this
is
a
big
bold
treat
that
is
intensely
flavorful
and
will
definitely
sneak
up
on
those
unaware
of
its
potency
it
is
probably
one
to
be
shared
amongst
friends
on
a
chillier
evening
after
a
nice
meal
i
can
see
this
pairing
well
with
desserts
during
the
thanksgiving
holidays
in
my
current
position
in
hot
humid
florida
probably
not
the
best
thing
a
well
made
beer
by
ccb
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
they
have
to
offer
if
i
were
to
make
changes
i
would
balance
the
spices
a
little
more
maybe
less
clove
and
cinnamon
bottle
purchased
at
the
brewpub
pours
a
deep
dark
reddish
orange
with
a
nice
fluffy
off
white
head
with
a
slightly
orange
hue
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
maybe
some
sweet
vanilla
and
some
faint
pumpkin
sweet
sugar
and
some
booze
when
i
take
a
big
whiff
sweet
pumpkin
flavor
and
some
cinnamon
and
clove
spice
lingering
sweet
vanilla
cream
and
pumpkin
is
definite
a
highlight
here
finishes
nice
medium
carbonation
would
be
even
better
if
it
werent
105
with
the
humidity
outside
neat
beer
even
for
non
pumpkin
beer
fans
absolutely
phenomenal
very
dark
in
color
with
a
slight
head
that
boils
down
to
nothing
smells
of
fall
no
other
way
to
explain
it
tastes
like
a
very
dark
ale
with
many
flavors
and
finishes
off
with
the
sweetness
of
pumpkin
pie
one
of
the
best
ccb
has
to
offer
o
another
great
ccb
brew
pumkin
beers
arent
usually
in
my
must
have
category
but
after
drinking
this
one
i
picked
up
a
few
bottles
from
my
friend
to
consume
later
into
the
season
a
definate
must
try
i
used
to
think
pumking
was
the
best
of
its
kind
boy
was
i
ever
wrong
especially
with
this
13
batch
good
gourd
is
easily
the
best
pumpkin
beer
and
is
now
my
new
holy
grail
the
smell
isnt
powerful
but
the
taste
is
a
little
gem
right
here
i
cant
wait
to
stock
up
the
most
hyped
pumpkin
ale
in
the
world
i
think
so
but
does
it
live
up
to
the
hype
yes
i
would
say
it
does
it
is
truly
unique
memorable
and
delicious
ccb
does
it
again
o
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
then
some
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
some
that
are
too
sweet
without
balance
or
where
the
pumpkin
is
overpowered
with
other
spices
but
ccb
did
a
great
job
balancing
the
flavors
and
the
heavy
abv
gives
it
some
character
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
from
ccb
and
hands
down
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
overall
so
glad
i
picked
up
this
beer
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
and
one
of
the
few
that
actually
have
pumpkin
in
it
its
a
bummer
that
it
is
so
damn
hot
outside
in
florida
right
now
these
flavors
make
me
long
for
bon
fires
and
cold
nights
pick
one
up
or
trade
while
you
can
overall
i
didnt
want
to
get
a
fall
beer
this
soon
but
it
being
ccb
i
went
ahead
and
picked
up
a
bottle
very
glad
i
did
it
just
makes
me
hate
that
its
summer
now
i
want
to
be
cold
and
enjoying
this
fantastic
beer
it
looks
great
the
aroma
last
throughout
and
the
taste
seemed
to
have
something
new
throughout
its
entire
session
ive
finished
this
glass
now
im
off
for
a
refill
o
great
beer
that
id
love
to
drink
again
in
high
season
gg
is
most
definitely
a
crowd
pleaser
and
by
far
the
best
in
a
style
thats
almost
always
mediocre
o
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
tasted
this
fall
i
had
my
first
good
gourd
as
my
first
beer
for
a
tailgate
after
most
of
the
pumpkin
hype
season
had
died
down
i
poured
it
into
a
red
wine
glass
my
best
option
and
immediately
noticed
that
i
liked
the
color
and
aroma
much
more
than
certain
other
pumpkin
ales
my
first
sip
i
was
hooked
i
bought
up
several
more
two
for
this
winter
and
a
few
to
age
for
next
year
i
picked
the
first
one
up
for
13
and
the
next
few
for
14
and
they
were
certainly
worth
the
price
imho
solid
for
a
higher
abv
pumpkin
ale
not
too
spicy
and
a
pretty
good
balance
o
fantastic
pumpkin
beer
another
hit
from
cc
hardly
taste
the
booze
for
the
abv
another
reason
i
love
cigar
city
beers
like
this
make
me
wonder
why
theres
not
more
love
for
pumpkin
beers
but
i
suppose
to
each
their
own
when
i
first
had
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
i
thought
the
alcohol
interfered
with
the
beer
13
months
of
age
did
wonders
o
i
seem
to
be
one
of
a
few
who
really
love
pumpkin
beers
this
is
a
phenomenal
representation
of
this
beer
styleflavor
the
sweetness
is
there
but
not
at
all
overwhelmingly
so
i
almost
dont
taste
any
booziness
that
says
something
at
8
5
to
me
this
is
a
perfect
fall
offering
thanks
voxomkid
for
the
opportunity
d
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
it
lives
up
to
what
some
have
said
about
it
despite
ccs
penchant
for
high
end
spices
the
pie
character
here
is
kind
of
bland
and
flabby
with
a
malt
character
that
only
serves
to
reinforce
that
impression
i
had
this
beer
when
it
first
came
out
and
remember
it
being
less
sweet
and
spicy
with
more
hops
in
the
balance
but
it
has
been
so
long
that
i
might
be
misremembering
it
at
this
point
overall
one
of
the
best
of
this
genre
and
style
very
flavorful
each
flavor
is
well
represented
and
distinct
a
must
try
overall
a
really
unique
interesting
and
complex
take
on
the
pumpkin
beer
style
the
spice
note
is
one
of
a
kind
and
doesnt
overwhelm
the
base
beer
one
of
my
new
favorites
of
this
style
definitely
want
to
try
this
again
balanced
smooth
and
complex
o
this
was
a
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
easily
one
of
the
best
ive
had
pumpkin
ales
are
not
easy
to
master
a
lot
of
breweries
dont
get
enough
pumpkin
to
come
out
and
some
overspice
ccb
did
a
great
job
in
creating
this
pumpkin
ale
and
i
highly
recommend
trying
it
out
this
beer
got
better
as
i
drank
it
it
has
a
vanilla
taste
to
it
but
the
vanilla
got
stronger
later
on
it
is
defiantly
a
better
tasting
beer
than
schlafly
but
it
is
not
as
good
as
pumpking
to
me
i
would
say
that
good
gourd
is
my
top
5
pumpkin
beers
to
date
this
beer
was
hard
to
find
i
ordered
it
from
letspour
com
online
since
the
beer
is
from
fla
this
was
very
enjoyable
overall
notmy
favorite
of
the
pumpkin
beers
but
this
is
definitely
a
solid
beer
in
the
category
nice
body
medium
in
the
feel
carbonation
could
be
a
little
higher
but
a
nice
ber
this
isnt
a
pumpkin
so
much
as
it
is
concentrated
essence
of
pumpkin
pie
so
much
spice
and
chewy
malt
the
pumpkin
loses
out
if
the
spices
dialed
down
a
touch
this
would
be
fantastic
so
spicy
this
beer
seems
to
treat
pumpkin
pie
spices
like
dipas
treat
hops
the
more
the
merrier
im
not
sure
if
i
really
enjoy
this
its
good
but
it
has
some
issues
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
pumpkin
beer
i
think
its
right
up
there
with
my
two
favorites
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
and
southern
tier
pumking
its
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
and
the
squashy
pumpkin
flavors
are
perfectly
complemented
by
holiday
spices
a
fantastic
fall
beer
big
thanks
to
kswartz
for
helping
me
get
a
hold
of
this
one
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
vibrant
orange
color
with
a
nice
looking
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
some
moderate
spice
notes
and
from
what
i
can
tell
some
of
the
freshest
pumpkingourd
aromas
ive
ever
experienced
from
a
beer
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
again
sweet
like
the
nose
but
balances
out
quite
nicely
with
the
subtle
amount
of
spice
that
has
been
used
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
heavy
its
got
a
solid
thickness
to
it
its
gently
carbonated
and
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
as
of
yet
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
looking
for
something
a
little
different
to
try
than
just
a
typical
pumpkin
beer
like
most
breweries
are
putting
out
this
one
sets
the
bar
pretty
high
in
my
opinion
thanks
chris
a
really
wonderful
pumpkin
ale
that
would
pair
nice
by
the
fireside
probably
also
good
with
traditional
fall
desserts
i
e
pumpkin
and
apple
pie
as
well
as
homemade
french
vanilla
ice
cream
you
might
take
a
chance
too
and
try
pairing
it
with
grilled
pork
loin
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
seek
it
out
i
personally
love
pumpkin
ales
i
know
its
a
polarizing
style
but
they
are
among
my
favorites
overall
this
was
well
worth
the
online
buy
from
luekens
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
couldnt
wait
until
sept
1
the
official
start
of
fall
and
football
season
in
my
book
this
year
to
try
it
for
me
it
kind
of
melded
together
a
lot
of
elements
of
schlafly
pumpkin
with
the
spice
profile
and
pumking
with
the
buttery
whipped
cream
finish
without
overdoing
it
as
i
feel
pumking
sort
of
does
i
will
definitely
be
ordering
more
of
this
in
the
future
seek
it
out
o
excellent
imperial
pumpkin
nails
a
nice
balance
isnt
too
heavy
and
comes
off
as
natural
this
is
what
an
imperial
pumpkin
should
taste
like
picked
this
up
on
a
brewery
tour
the
day
after
it
was
bottled
816
one
of
the
spiciest
pumpkin
beers
ive
tasted
tasted
like
a
delicious
mildly
boozy
pumpkin
pie
had
it
with
dinner
but
it
was
definitely
more
of
a
dessert
or
sipping
beer
as
it
is
intensely
pumpkinpie
like
definitely
wish
i
had
picked
up
multiple
bottles
highly
recommend
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
o
this
one
is
overall
ok
but
i
deducted
significant
points
for
the
off
flavor
the
only
think
i
know
to
cause
this
would
be
oxidization
but
i
know
that
its
fresh
and
one
wouldnt
think
there
would
be
hightemperature
exposure
between
the
brewery
the
tasting
room
as
theyre
literally
connected
either
way
this
had
promise
but
didnt
deliver
i
did
buy
a
bottle
so
if
it
is
significantly
different
i
will
update
this
review
the
aroma
is
very
spicy
with
pumpkin
cardboard
and
caramel
malt
the
appearance
is
amber
with
an
average
head
the
taste
is
a
little
like
the
aroma
but
has
an
astringent
bitterness
but
it
is
definitely
a
pumpkin
the
mouth
feel
is
average
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
i
want
more
pumpkin
and
less
bitter
o
4
0
i
first
drank
this
fall
seasonal
the
june
after
its
release
it
wasnt
even
fresh
but
still
tasted
fine
then
i
had
it
fresh
the
following
release
and
it
wasnt
much
different
then
that
one
again
the
following
march
i
swear
a
bit
of
age
actually
makes
it
better
counterintuitively
it
isnt
one
id
want
to
session
all
night
given
the
specialty
flavors
involved
but
as
a
special
seasonal
a
375ml
is
nice
usually
im
a
few
sips
in
to
a
pumpkin
beer
before
it
starts
to
feel
like
a
chore
to
get
through
it
but
this
one
is
nice
april
2013
bottle
confirms
that
this
keeps
getting
better
with
age
odifferent
not
what
i
usually
drink
but
something
thats
good
with
food
and
desert
spices
are
a
bit
overbearing
but
blend
in
well
nice
beer
poured
from
750ml
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
burnt
orange
along
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
laces
decent
throughout
aromas
are
crisp
toast
and
caramel
vanilla
and
toffee
biscuits
and
pumpkin
puree
a
bit
sweeter
with
decent
pie
spice
flavors
of
allspice
nutmeg
mild
vanilla
and
some
caramel
some
crispness
fairly
balanced
for
a
sweeter
beer
spice
and
vanilla
sweet
malts
finish
is
nice
gentle
spice
and
sweetness
linger
its
not
complex
but
its
tasty
sweet
slanted
without
being
anywhere
near
cloying
fairly
balanced
and
quite
a
smooth
pumpkin
ale
this
is
another
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
i
like
when
my
pumpkin
beers
arent
overwhelmed
by
spices
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
its
nothing
mind
blowing
but
a
good
large
format
pumpkin
ale
to
share
flavor
keeps
up
with
the
nose
a
great
balance
between
the
pumpkin
and
spice
i
get
more
clove
in
the
taste
balanced
by
brown
sugar
poured
a
hazy
orange
a
decent
dense
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
fall
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
etc
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
but
just
bolder
and
with
the
added
hint
of
pumpkin
very
creamy
and
tasty
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
carbonation
is
spot
on
and
it
has
a
nice
balanced
mouthfeel
the
9
is
hidden
amazingly
well
making
this
very
drinkable
would
love
to
try
this
again
sometime
yes
that
is
a
trade
offer
overall
hands
down
the
best
tasting
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
doesnt
taste
artificial
its
not
too
over
the
top
and
its
balanced
as
hell
as
far
as
the
pumpkin
flavor
and
the
spice
a
very
enjoyable
beer
o
a
good
pumpkin
ale
that
could
use
a
creamier
body
and
more
depth
of
flavor
still
it
smells
great
and
is
tasty
o
overall
holy
cow
is
this
spectacular
hands
down
my
favorite
tasting
pumpkin
beer
excellent
flavours
with
a
very
nice
appearance
and
nose
its
worth
saying
again
that
the
flavours
are
spectactular
really
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
of
this
stuff
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
just
the
right
amount
o
spice
and
pumpkin
not
too
much
of
either
which
i
feel
is
the
case
with
most
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
o
a
really
good
pumpkin
beer
if
more
pumpkin
beers
were
made
like
this
one
i
would
actually
seek
them
out
and
buy
them
o
ccbs
good
gourd
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
around
if
readily
available
in
my
market
this
would
be
a
constant
in
my
fridge
during
the
crisp
cool
autumn
days
easily
recommended
and
absolutely
worth
seeking
out
for
the
pumpkin
beer
aficionado
and
general
beer
advocate
alike
i
still
have
a
bottle
of
this
that
i
plan
on
sharing
for
thanksgiving
high
alcohol
makes
it
good
to
share
but
still
not
too
high
that
finishing
most
of
the
bottle
for
me
wouldnt
be
hard
either
another
great
ccb
brew
honestly
speaking
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
this
year
and
ive
had
way
too
many
overall
great
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
nice
pumpkin
flavors
earthy
hops
and
spices
great
malt
balance
great
pumpkin
pie
o
all
in
all
this
is
another
representation
of
why
i
love
ccb
they
took
the
style
they
set
out
to
brew
and
made
an
above
standard
representation
of
it
if
you
like
pumpkin
spiced
beers
then
you
should
definitely
give
this
bad
boy
a
try
o
overall
i
think
i
may
have
just
tasted
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
tried
it
really
is
phenomenal
but
if
you
dont
like
pumpkin
beers
dont
expect
to
like
this
one
heres
hoping
i
see
it
again
soon
overall
this
must
be
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
to
date
just
amazing
how
well
balanced
and
nuanced
it
is
while
still
tasting
like
pumpkin
and
spice
its
the
beer
i
wish
pumking
was
o
very
well
done
not
quite
able
to
top
schlafly
but
this
is
a
top
contender
the
way
the
beer
feels
and
the
way
the
ingredients
are
so
individualistic
while
still
forming
a
unique
lingering
blend
is
incredible
would
come
back
to
this
again
and
again
in
season
a
very
nice
somewhat
spiceforward
pumpkin
ale
with
a
tasty
creamy
vanilla
character
also
o
definitely
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
complex
malty
bready
caramelly
and
filled
with
pumpkin
flavors
spicing
is
mild
and
artfully
done
only
lending
support
to
the
brew
as
a
whole
well
done
o
overall
good
gourd
is
a
really
tasty
pumpkin
ale
i
would
put
it
in
the
upper
tier
of
pumpkin
beers
recommended
o
just
jumped
pumking
as
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
excellent
all
around
here
pours
an
orange
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
that
sticks
around
in
my
bruery
tulip
aromas
of
pumpkin
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
ginger
taste
follows
nose
really
creamy
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
i
could
drink
it
all
year
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
quite
creamy
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
there
are
lots
of
fruity
alcohol
notes
and
a
solid
balance
of
modest
spices
that
keep
everything
in
check
for
an
8
5
offering
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
overall
this
is
a
solid
take
on
the
style
not
the
best
i
have
had
bu
tone
that
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
or
twice
o
id
go
b
or
a
on
this
one
mainly
because
i
dont
like
pumpkins
its
bette
than
the
artificial
flavored
ones
for
sure
though
i
picked
this
up
in
secret
halloween
11
thanks
michael
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
deep
orange
pour
big
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
with
pumpkin
pie
spice
especially
allspice
the
flavor
is
in
good
balance
good
amounts
of
pumpkin
and
spices
are
mixed
it
has
a
dry
finish
the
body
is
medium
light
alcohol
notes
good
carbonation
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
ever
had
o
very
drinkable
as
its
smooth
but
not
ridiculously
sweet
at
all
favorite
pumpkin
beer
that
ive
had
so
far
this
was
8
at
the
brewery
and
a
couple
of
places
around
gainesville
im
picking
up
another
bottle
ill
be
looking
for
more
bottles
or
i
just
will
have
to
wait
til
next
year
appears
as
a
dark
orange
and
with
a
finger
thick
head
a
decent
amount
of
nutmeg
on
the
nose
tastes
lighter
than
the
average
pumpkin
ale
is
refreshing
and
could
be
a
great
session
beer
nutmeg
hits
on
the
back
end
of
the
tongue
its
a
faint
amount
and
definitely
not
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
enhances
the
nutmeg
notes
a
great
overall
pumpkin
beer
that
doesnt
overdo
it
o
excellent
aroma
flavor
fits
perfectly
in
his
style
very
pumpkin
flavor
with
his
popular
ingredients
a
pumpkin
beer
that
i
could
recommend
overall
a
bit
dissapointing
i
was
hoping
this
would
rival
pumking
or
treat
but
it
doesnt
quite
make
it
there
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
fantastic
pumpkin
beer
the
spices
werent
overdone
and
the
sweetness
definitely
helped
smooth
them
out
even
more
very
nice
pumpkin
pie
like
flavor
to
it
overall
definitely
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
but
it
doesnt
quite
beat
out
pumking
for
me
really
well
done
pumpkin
ale
cc
just
continues
to
impress
glad
i
picked
up
two
of
these
overall
there
was
something
about
this
beer
that
struck
me
as
off
the
feel
was
a
little
bit
light
and
there
is
some
pumpkin
residue
flavor
that
is
not
appealing
overall
a
really
nice
change
from
the
pumpkin
spice
beers
i
really
enjoyed
this
that
said
it
still
falls
short
of
my
top
tier
frogs
hollow
double
pumpkin
by
hoppin
frog
and
devious
imperial
pumpkin
by
bethlehem
brew
works
tie
for
top
honors
among
pumpkin
ales
but
good
gourd
ranks
a
solid
3
snugly
above
st
pumking
and
dfh
punkin
cheers
medium
bodied
and
fairly
balanced
easily
drinkable
and
not
boozy
at
all
coming
in
at
9
drinks
a
little
bit
bigger
than
your
typical
pumpkin
ale
decent
beer
but
nothing
that
really
sets
it
apart
from
the
others
it
pours
orange
in
color
leaving
very
little
head
and
tracing
cinammon
and
nutmeg
spices
are
prevelant
in
the
smell
very
well
balanced
between
sweetness
and
tart
tastes
like
a
liquified
pumpkin
pie
with
a
slight
alcohol
aftertaste
for
an
8
the
alcohol
aftertaste
isnt
inappropriate
or
intruding
nice
warm
feeling
in
the
stomach
try
it
o
this
may
be
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
smuttynose
is
excellent
but
slightly
too
hoppy
pumking
has
just
a
little
too
much
breadyness
and
sweetness
this
is
balanced
delicious
and
has
a
touch
of
what
makes
each
other
pumpkin
ale
great
in
it
o
a
nice
beer
for
a
pumpkin
beer
good
flavor
not
cloying
would
drink
this
occassionally
without
a
problem
pours
a
pretty
brown
amber
with
nice
clarity
thin
finger
of
foam
leaving
very
little
lacing
the
nose
hits
with
nutmeg
a
dry
vegetal
pumpkin
quality
cinnamon
candy
and
baking
spices
it
is
very
much
like
pumpkin
pie
spices
are
prevalent
with
almost
a
creamy
pie
crust
scent
the
nose
is
what
gets
me
multilayered
complex
chocolate
notes
this
beer
looks
like
theobroma
and
drinks
like
what
theobroma
wishes
it
could
be
straight
pumpkin
pie
in
the
mouth
full
of
spices
and
rich
pumpkin
flavor
that
finishes
with
nice
carbonation
and
a
dry
vegetal
quality
at
the
end
almost
a
touch
astrigent
on
the
finish
and
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
vegetal
quality
it
presents
but
this
is
by
far
and
away
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
o
a
very
nice
pumpkin
beer
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
had
not
too
sweet
not
overly
spiced
just
a
nicely
balanced
flavor
profile
that
has
the
spice
elements
of
a
good
pumpkin
beer
in
combination
with
more
of
an
earthy
pumpkin
profile
o
solid
pumpkin
brew
but
not
as
good
as
my
favorite
schlafly
pumpkin
that
said
i
would
def
have
it
again
and
its
on
the
better
side
of
my
experiences
with
this
style
recommend
overall
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
ale
definitely
top
5
for
me
and
one
of
the
most
noticeably
complex
pumpkins
that
ive
had
on
a
side
note
i
noticed
the
bottle
was
a
little
better
than
on
tap
and
definitely
better
served
a
little
warmer
o
this
is
definitely
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
to
date
the
pumpkin
was
purest
in
this
one
and
nicely
integrated
in
with
the
spices
on
tap
at
vine
barley
umm
pumpkin
this
is
why
i
love
the
fall
and
cigar
city
its
good
to
drink
a
beer
where
i
taste
pumpkin
and
not
a
lot
of
spices
now
there
are
some
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
vanilla
but
just
enough
to
enhance
the
flavor
of
the
pumpkin
there
is
nothing
artificial
about
this
beer
i
can
and
will
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
great
job
joey
and
wayne
overall
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
for
me
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
like
many
cigar
city
beers
tend
to
be
so
if
you
are
opposed
to
the
sweeter
end
of
beers
this
may
not
be
for
you
that
being
said
this
is
still
quite
impressive
recommended
and
worth
seeking
out
for
fans
of
this
style
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
a
bit
light
on
the
spices
and
lighter
in
body
than
i
prefer
in
a
pumpkin
beer
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
pours
a
moderate
orangecopper
with
a
good
offwhite
head
decent
retention
and
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carried
a
lot
of
squash
and
pumpkin
with
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
miscellaneous
spice
in
the
background
the
flavor
didnt
have
quite
as
much
spice
and
really
focused
on
the
squash
element
not
too
sweet
which
was
nice
chewy
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
spice
zest
in
the
finish
good
brew
pours
a
nice
copperorange
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
to
a
slight
haze
and
ring
nice
pumpkin
aromas
mixed
with
brown
sugar
and
the
usual
pumpkin
pie
spices
moderately
sweet
the
brown
sugarmolasses
character
comes
out
nicely
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
but
with
a
very
pronounced
pumpkin
flavor
this
is
probably
the
most
pumkiny
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
its
definitely
more
pumpkin
then
spice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
slightly
creamy
with
a
touchovermedium
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
one
of
my
new
favorite
pumpkin
beers
love
that
you
can
really
taste
the
pumpkin
overall
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
i
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
with
my
wifes
best
friend
she
enjoyed
this
ale
a
lot
too
i
am
impressed
with
every
cigar
city
brew
i
try
whatever
it
is
they
do
there
i
hope
they
never
stop
this
is
my
second
favorite
pumpkin
ale
next
to
dogfish
heads
cheers
o
well
this
taste
pretty
much
like
pumking
to
me
i
can
tell
its
high
quality
but
im
still
not
on
board
pumpkin
beer
should
be
anything
but
a
stout
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
closest
pumpkin
ale
i
can
compare
it
to
is
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
which
i
have
not
had
since
last
year
but
i
really
enjoyed
that
beer
i
like
pumpkin
ales
a
lot
but
after
having
a
few
pumple
drumkin
this
just
blows
it
out
of
the
water
and
i
had
thought
it
was
only
mediocre
on
the
low
side
good
gourd
should
probably
be
renamed
great
gourd
or
maybe
that
is
for
the
sequel
that
has
been
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
the
cpj
full
body
lightish
effervescence
slighty
drying
finish
with
a
hatsh
almost
peppery
burn
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
nutmeg
perhaps
not
up
to
the
usual
standards
of
ccb
get
you
some
paaaahhh
delicious
pumpkin
beer
but
it
is
a
bit
bitter
in
the
finish
the
smell
however
is
totally
where
its
at
love
cigar
city
beer
pours
a
hazy
reddish
orange
with
one
finger
of
cream
colored
head
settles
to
a
thin
ring
couple
thin
rings
left
on
the
glass
smell
pretty
substantial
cooked
canned
pumpkin
sweet
a
little
butterscotch
nutmeg
and
allspice
with
mild
toasted
and
twangy
grain
in
the
back
really
mild
note
of
clove
taste
pretty
close
to
a
liquid
bite
of
pumpkin
pie
with
a
little
whipped
cream
on
it
the
pumpkin
is
the
star
but
with
ample
doses
of
nutmeg
allspice
and
cinnamon
and
a
little
clove
in
the
finish
mild
spicy
earthy
hopping
get
the
impression
of
a
belgian
pale
ish
base
beer
mixes
really
well
with
the
pie
spices
very
good
man
just
a
lovely
pumpkin
ale
here
very
round
soft
and
velvety
on
the
palate
so
soft
and
feminine
in
mouthfeel
and
flavors
things
meld
greatly
with
out
being
overly
spicy
cinnamon
cardamon
nutmeg
quince
clove
pumpkin
flavors
some
graham
cracker
all
spice
nutty
flavors
and
more
just
a
fantastic
pumpkin
rivals
pumking
its
a
close
one
oas
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
ive
only
ever
liked
pumpkin
and
pumpking
ive
now
added
good
gourd
in
fact
this
puts
punkin
to
shame
its
such
a
complex
and
balanced
blend
of
great
flavors
thanks
again
to
bryanole
for
shooting
these
my
way
i
have
a
couple
of
extra
bottles
for
the
fall
football
tailgating
season
that
will
come
in
handy
overall
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
to
date
but
not
perfect
the
smell
is
wonderful
but
the
taste
is
not
quite
as
good
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
one
finger
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
typical
pumpkin
pie
spices
like
cardamom
cinnamon
all
spice
etc
there
is
also
a
nice
pumpkinsquash
aroma
behind
the
spices
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
spices
and
i
get
a
good
amount
of
whippedcream
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
for
a
9
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
id
prefer
this
to
be
a
little
less
carbonated
overall
the
second
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
i
think
this
would
benefit
from
some
aging
and
i
will
try
to
review
this
some
time
next
year
highly
recommended
for
a
pumpkin
beer
this
has
very
good
head
retention
and
carbonation
though
the
carb
is
slightly
loopy
nice
half
a
finger
white
head
orange
auburn
in
color
slightly
opaque
it
looks
warm
and
fall
like
full
aroma
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
really
nice
fresh
spice
pop
not
muted
at
all
there
is
also
some
toasty
malted
aroma
off
the
bat
i
can
taste
warm
and
toasted
malts
some
roasted
squash
flavor
coupled
with
a
good
hit
of
vanilla
mid
palate
all
the
way
to
the
finish
is
freshly
ground
pumpkin
pie
spices
a
tad
cloying
but
not
really
too
sweet
just
a
really
full
bodied
full
flavored
pumpkin
ale
i
wish
this
beer
had
some
more
true
pumpkin
flavor
but
otherwise
this
is
very
very
good
this
is
so
close
to
my
favorite
but
pumking
still
rains
supreme
for
me
a
good
pumpkin
ale
not
great
but
surely
didnt
disappoint
o
very
nice
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
best
i
have
had
d
pretty
solid
pumpkin
ale
here
as
mentioned
good
flavor
profile
but
a
little
lighter
on
the
nose
and
palate
than
i
would
have
hoped
overall
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
of
the
season
at
11
99
per
bottle
its
a
bit
price
to
get
again
well
worth
trying
it
once
though
loved
it
overall
this
will
be
a
repeat
buy
so
far
the
best
release
of
2011
for
my
palate
full
bodied
creamy
with
spice
and
a
real
pumpkin
flavor
delicious
o
i
think
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
brew
but
the
aroma
falls
way
short
i
would
put
this
one
above
average
but
not
on
the
level
of
pumking
imho
skal
overall
excellent
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
like
almost
everything
from
cigar
city
i
highly
recommend
this
one
highly
spiced
but
yet
not
overpowering
as
you
see
a
lot
with
these
pumpkins
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
a
good
amount
of
fresh
grass
or
even
a
tree
like
smell
to
it
lots
of
spice
running
through
it
though
and
i
could
pick
up
even
on
some
apple
in
there
as
well
i
thought
the
aroma
was
very
well
put
together
overall
a
nice
grainy
almost
yeast
like
back
to
it
which
really
served
to
lighten
it
up
this
was
followed
by
loads
of
fall
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
lots
of
spiced
apple
just
a
good
all
around
mix
there
was
a
noticeable
hoppy
presence
and
this
definitely
could
not
be
hidden
great
finish
thanks
to
digita7693
for
bringing
a
growler
up
to
jax
the
same
day
for
tasting
fresh
from
the
tap
room
92010
d
its
good
but
in
the
tasting
it
was
lowerend
and
out
of
what
ive
tried
in
the
style
its
near
the
middle
id
skip
it
d
easy
to
put
down
a
few
not
something
easily
said
of
many
pumpkin
beers
drinkability
great
pumpkin
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
amazing
nose
and
flavor
d
great
pumpkin
ale
and
will
revisit
when
able
awesome
pumpkin
one
of
the
best
ive
found
would
love
to
try
this
again
sometime
the
ever
so
controversial
pumpkin
ales
what
to
do
with
them
had
the
ipa
at
the
tasting
room
pumpkin
ales
are
very
up
and
down
and
are
ususally
very
pricey
well
this
guy
was
way
up
poured
a
very
nice
fall
brown
color
with
a
medium
density
white
head
for
me
ccb
does
the
best
job
balancing
beers
flavors
this
pumpkin
was
balnced
in
the
hops
spice
and
pumpkin
flavors
my
favorite
pumpkin
dont
try
to
convince
me
otherwise
d
this
is
an
absolute
winner
of
a
pumpkin
ale
finally
a
pumpkin
beer
that
rivals
pumpking
i
hope
they
end
up
bottling
this
one
i
would
love
to
stock
up
every
fall
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
a
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
d
considering
my
many
other
experiences
with
cigar
city
this
is
a
surprisingly
subtle
and
understated
brew
it
was
quite
enjoyable
but
it
was
quickly
forgotten
after
moving
on
to
the
next
few
brews
i
heard
the
test
batch
was
quite
different
but
i
gotta
review
the
beer
i
try
in
any
case
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beer
offerings
but
i
think
i
prefer
pumking
a
little
bit
and
flossmoors
extinct
big
black
pumpkin
of
course
d
pumpkin
ales
are
sort
of
hard
to
do
since
the
spicing
can
really
mess
them
up
im
happy
that
ccb
has
managed
to
keep
things
within
reason
and
make
for
an
enjoyable
beer
bottle

the
same
with
some
stronger
pumpkin
and
spice
notes
heavy
cream
flavors
slightly
boozey
generally
medium
body
with
a
pleasing
herbspice
finish
this
was
an
amazing
pumpkin
beer
and
likely
the
best
that
i
have
had
d
i
tasted
this
one
when
it
was
first
finished
and
the
booze
could
really
be
detected
since
it
has
aged
a
bit
the
alcohol
flavors
have
died
and
the
pumpkin
spice
and
buttery
goodness
have
come
together
to
create
one
wonderful
brew
i
popped
the
cap
and
began
a
somewhat
gentle
pour
since
i
was
unsure
if
there
might
be
any
lees
i
need
not
have
worried
as
i
still
got
just
over
a
finger
of
dense
tawny
head
with
decent
retention
color

deep
amberlight
copper

nothing
really
discernable
taste
is
pumpkin
up
front
with
a
mix
of
flavors
in
the
middle
and
bitter
lemon
at
the
end
an
ok
beer
but
there
are
much
better
pumpkin
beers
available
just
not
a
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
only
an
ok
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
new
belgium
in
fact
fat
tire
abbey
and
1554
are
three
of
my
favorite
beers
but
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
in
my
opinion
theres
no
balance
here
at
all
the
sourness
of
this
beer
just
overpowers
everything
and
i
cant
taste
much
of
the
malt
or
sweetness
sour
fans
will
probably
love
this
beer
but
alas
i
do
not
sorry
new
belgium
this
one
was
a
strike
out
for
me
overall
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
the
color
aroma
and
taste
of
this
beer
are
great
and
the
beer
has
great
balance
in
the
taste
normally
i
dont
like
new
belgium
beers
very
much
but
this
one
is
an
exception
at
first
taste
this
beer
was
too
sour
and
too
much
cranberry
flavor
it
lacked
any
hop
flavor
or
aroma
i
initially
rated
it
3
375
however
as
i
have
worked
through
the
6
pack
over
several
weeks
it
has
grown
on
me
it
is
still
sour
and
needs
hops
but
the
after
taste
is
that
of
pumpkin
spice
reminiscent
of
belgian
beers
or
a
fine
hefeweizen
in
the
end
new
belgium
lived
up
to
their
goal
of
brewing
in
the
belgian
style
however
untraditional

best
pumpkin

i
have
tried
so
far
the
spices
mix
exceptionally
well
with
the
pumpkin
juice
the
slight
taste
of
cranberry
seals
the
deal
to
create
an
ultimate
pumpkin
ale
experience
overall
3

pumpkick
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
the
droopy
drowsy
mouthfeel
along
with
its
flat
flavor
profile
makes
this
only
a
little
better
than
the
worst
pumpkin
ales
for
the
record
i
would
drink
this
again
and
i
wont
knock
it
because
the
flavor
is
good
its
just
fleeting
and
watery
the
label
is
great
and
its
an
interesting
concept
but
if
new
belgium
reads
these
things
spice
it
up
a
bit
with
an
injection
of
carbonation
good
fall
beer
pumpkin
yes
but
i
felt
like
the
cranberry
tartness
kind
of
overpowered
the
nice
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
o
i
really
dug
this
unique
pumpkin
beer
offering
the
cranberry
flavor
really
added
a
nice
dimension
of
sweetness
with
the
pumpkin
spices
a
soso
and
kind
of
underwhelming
version
of
the
style
as
the
pumpkin
and
spice
alike
seem
to
be
phoning
it
in
not
sure
that
im
overly
content
paying
premium
canadian
prices
for
this
when
i
could
have
had
it
for
a
song
a
few
weeks
ago
in
denver
very
nice
beer
smooth
pumpkin
tastes
with
a
heavy
finish
of
nutmeg
i
like
nutmeg
so
i
liked
the
beer
others
that
were
looking
for
a
strong
pumpkin
need
to
look
elsewhere
but
i
will
buy
it
again
it
also
has
a
new
label
for
2014
that
was
quite
entertaining
when
i
drink
a
pumpkin
ale
i
want
to
know
im
drinking
a
pumpkin
ale
this
is
what
a
pumpkin
ale
is
supposed
to
taste
like
theres
nothing
subtle
about
this
beer
the
pumpkin
taste
and
aroma
hit
you
right
away
along
with
hints
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
its
like
a
liquid
pumpkin
pie
minus
the
terrible
sweetness
and
you
can
drink
it
guiltfree
knowing
they
only
use
the
best
freshest
nongmo
ingredients
and
sustainable
business
practices
a
piece
of
liquid
pumpkin
pie
but
better
its
definitely
not
bad
tasting
but
it
is
a
poor
representation
of
the
style
the
fruit
juices
added
and
the
abundance
of
cinnamon
make
it
taste
more
like
a
mulled
cider
than
a
pumpkin
beer
for
this
style
i
like
it
a
lot
not
very
heavy
on
the
spices
a
tiny
tart
of
cranberry
and
very
smooth
this
is
a
great
beer
some
pumpkin
beers
are
overpowered
by
cinnamon
and
while
delicious
are
not
beers
you
can
drink
more
than
one
of
pumpkick
is
delicious
it
has
lemon
and
cranberry
undertones
and
tastes
more
like
a
slice
of
pumpkin
bread
it
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
surprised
to
see
so
many
mediocre
ratings
for
this
tasty
fall
beverage
from
the
first
whiff
you
can
tell
this
beer
is
exactly
as
advertised
a
pumpkin
beer
with
a
twist
a
lot
of
pumpkin
pie
in
the
aroma
up
front
with
the
combination
of
spices
and
pumpkin
before
the
cranberry
really
reveals
itself
first
sip
shows
more
of
a
balance
between
the
sweet
and
tart
with
a
nice
malty
note
in
there
as
well
overall
a
nice
twist
on
the
standard
pumpkin
beer
subtle
notes
of
nutmeg
make
this
beer
a
nice
reminder
of
fall
but
not
too
overwhelming
overall
a
damn
solid
pumpkin
brew
from
new
belgium
the
cranberry
twist
livens
up
this
pumpkin
ale
without
compromising
its
integrity
to
the
style
if
youre
looking
for
something
with
a
unique
take
on
the
usual
pumpkin
ale
give
this
one
a
go
o
pleaseant
and
intersting
beer
intersting
for
both
the
unusual
flavor
profile
and
the
mismatch
between
aroma
and
flavor
this
is
my
pick
for
pumpkin
beer
of
the
year
so
far
lots
of
pumpkin
favor
well
balanced
with
an
interesting
contribution
from
the
cranberry
i
like
it
better
than
this
years
dfh
punkin
o
im
not
a
huge
pumpkin
beer
fan
now
i
remember
why
i
am
rating
this
3
but
if
you
are
a
fan
of
this
style
maybe
it
is
good
to
you
not
me
the
body
is
an
equally
crisp
and
smooth
one
in
a
body
that
starts
medium
and
while
remaining
there
drifting
toward
light
as
it
goes
it
starts
with
little
action
on
the
tongue
in
terms
of
dryness
which
comes
into
the
middle
along
with
something
thats
not
quite
acidic
but
feels
similar

the

theres
also
the

not
one
of
their

o
best
pumpkin
beer
that
i
have
had
to

at

it

more
of

pumpkin

i
bit
to
much
of
a
pumpkin
taste
for
me
i
prefer
something
more
subtle
pumpkin
taste
i
like
pumpkin
ales
with
some
other
spice
taste
to
compliment
the
pumpkin
gold
like
a
real
pumpkin
with
excellent
flavor
very
nice
and
one
of
the
better
pumpkins
this
season
wasnt
a
big
new
belgium
fan
beyond
fat
tire
when
they
came
to
north
florida
but
the
newer
brews
are
really
some
of
the
best
ive
had
from
any
brewer
in
a
long
while
o
the
cranberry
adds
a
different
kick
to
the
style
i
didnt
think
that
i
would
like
this
one
but
its
actually
pretty
good
overall
good
delivers
as
advertised
i
didnt
know
if
id
like
the
cranberry
infusion
but
i
did
a
good
offering
from
new
belgium
overall
the
avantgarde
kick
in
pumpkick
doesnt
do
the
beer
any
favors
it
could
have
been
passable
as
a
more
traditional
pumpkin
ale
but
something
funky
throws
it
off
kilter
beer
brewed
with
pumpkin
juice
and
cranberry
juice
didnt
sound
good
on
paper
and
it
tastes
just
as
good
at
it
sounded
still
trying
to
figure
out
why
new
belgium
has
such
a
considerable
following
3
535

overall
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
it
tasted
clean
maybe
its
old
dunno
overall
just
a
very
average
run
of
the
mill
pumpkin
ale
quite
sessionable
but
all
around
unremarkable
1
finger
head
lasts
1
minute
smells
tinny
at
first
and
then
after
a
few
wiffs
i
can
smell
the
cranberry
lots
of
tiny
small
cranberry
bits
at
the
bottom
cloudy
appearance
fruity
aroma
but
without
the
fruity
taste
nice
reddish
orange
color
fresh
taste
that
is
a
bit
thin
and
dry
slightly
acidic
with
a
fair
amount
if
carbonation
i
cant
taste
any
pumpkin
nor
anything
else
for
that
matter
refreshing
but
not
much
going
on
still
dont
know
why
they
call
this
pumpkick
as
there
is
absolutely
no
pumpkin
whatsoever
should
have
called
it
cranberry
kick
its
a
so
so
beer
that
to
me
is
better
enjoyed
in
the
summer
if
you
are
a
pumpkin
fan
this
will
be
a
big
disappointment
but
not
too
bad
as
a
dessert
beer
paired
with
fruit
the
feel
is
bubbly
but
not
harsh
and
it
ends
very
clean
overall
the
beer
has
an
okay
pumpkin
flavor
and
cranberry
a
descent
tasting
beer
the
cranberry
offers
a
dry
tannin
to
the
finish
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
mediumhigh
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
at
first
fizzy
calming
to
a
gentle
foaminess
on
the
palate
a
bit
less
carbonation
would
have
suited
this
beer
better
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
and
lips
the
potential
is
there
and
i
wanted
to
like
it
but
i
wish
everything
was
more
potent
and
more
expressive
worth
a
try
but
there
are
much
better
pumpkin
beers
available
hopefully
the
tweak
this
one
for
next
year
light
bodied
and
over
carbonated
not
worth
seeking
out
d
nice
little
holiday
offering
not
something
that
i
would
drink
on
the
reg
but
i
do
like
that
the
key
ingredients
are
noticeable
without
being
overly
so
all
in
all
the
pumpkin
cranberry
thing
works
despite
critics
i
actallly
looved
this
beer
great
pumpkin
taste
and
it
just
hit
the
spot
for
me
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
on
the
market
but
a
great
beer
to
have
during
a
nice
fall
day
and
i
think
that
accounts
for
something
so
really
dont
knock
this
beer
to
you
have
tried
it
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
prost
lampertland
overall
i
had
this
beer
last
year
when
it
was
just
called
kick
and
a
part
of
the
lips
of
faith
series
and
it
was
fantastic
sadly
in
turning
it
into
a
seasonal
6pack
i
feel
they
seriously
toned
it
down
in
order
to
give
it
more
mainstream
appeal
i
will
not
be
buying
this
again
in
future
years
i
poured
this
beer
and
it
has
a
light
color
body
with
not
much
head
to
it
the
aroma
has
a
slight
spice
to
it
the
taste
has
slight
pumpkin
flavor
and
some
spice
i
also
get
a
very
light
tart
hint
of
the
cranberry
mouthfeel
is
weak
and
overall
this
beer
is
ok
overall
drinkability
its
not
that
there
is
too
much
nutmeg
its
that
there
is
really
nothing
but
nutmeg
reminds
me
of
an
extraspiced
blue
moon
pumpkick
certainly
has
some
interesting
spicing
going
on
as
you
let
it
warm
i
feel
that
if
you
go
into
this
beer
expecting
to
find
a
pumpkin
ale
you
are
going
to
be
let
down
the
spices
are
a
little
light
and
err
more
towards
the
lemongrass
and
cinnamon
than
a
pumpkin
pie
sweetness
a
well
done
pumpkin
ale
the
taste
and
aroma
are
pleasant
but
i
would
have
liked
them
to
be
a
bit
more
predominant
a
very
good
beer
that
balances
the
pumpkin
spice
and
fruity
flavors
quite
well
i
feel
the
pumpkin
and
spices
could
even
be
ramped
up
a
bit
however
i
prefer
the
understated
flavors
of
this
beer
over
some
others
where
the
spices
are
overdone
overall
a
pretty
solid
twist
on
a
pumpkin
ale
the
added
fruits
mix
well
with
the
pumpkin
and
spices
i
am
a
fan
of
pumpkin
so
naturally
this
was
a
beer
to
accommodate
my
pallet
unlike
other
beers
with
pumpkin
flavor
this
had
some
of
the
spiciness
that
one
would
expect
from
pumpkin
pie
further
it
had
a
strong
finish
being
somewhat
thick
its
not
a
brew
to
chug
o
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tried
i
really
like
the
variety
of
flavor
i
got
from
this
one
the
cranberry
juice
is
a
great
complement
to
the
pumpkin
spice
and
really
gives
this
beer
some
complexity
that
other
pumpkin
ales
lack
i
enjoy
pumpkin
flavors
but
am
not
as
obsessed
as
some
seem
to
be
but
i
usually
give
one
or
two
of
these
ales
a
try
every
season
this
is
one
that
i
would
buy
again
overall
i
like
this
version
of
the
pumpkin
ale
a
lot
the
cranberry
is
refreshing
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
smells
of
apple
cider
with
a
strong
cinnamon
component
there
is
some
nutmeg
as
well
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
cinnamon
then
some
light
beechwood
then
some
cranberry
juice
and
a
earthy
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
overall
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
overallcomments
this
was
a
very
good
beer
that
was
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
however
had
nothing
that
really
made
it
stand
out
except
for
maybe
the
tartness
while
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
this
is
still
a
very
good
and
respectable
offering
classified
as
a
pumpkin
ale

a

of

we

the

decent
spice
notes
and
good
body
though
again
only
one
of
two
pumpkin
ales
are
ones
i
consider
really
good
this
is
decent
i
liked
this
better
than
i
expected
the
cranberry
character
is
subtle
enough
to
allow
the
pumpkin
and
spices
to
shine
this
beer
is
just
okay
and
not
something
id
have
again
not
even
in
the
fall
when
pumpkin
beers
are
all
the
rage
othis
is
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
it
smells
alright
but
it
looks
funky
tastes
funky
and
feels
funky
the
cranberries
dont
seem
to
add
much
and
in
fact
i
think
the
tart
flavor
sort
of
takes
away
from
the
rest
of
the
flavor
and
gives
it
a
sort
of
mixedup
profile
meh
bottom
line
pumpkick
strikes
me
as
more
of
a
novelty
seasonal
beer
jumping
on
the
pumpkin
flavored
insert
food
or
drink
here
bandwagon
it
is
not
bad
in
fact
it
is
much
better
than
i
expected
obviously
those
who
do
not
like
pumpkin
flavored
drinks
or
food
should
avoid
this
beer
it
is
not
overwhelming
but
this
tasted
more
like
a
spiced
fall
beverage
than
a
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
go
for
it
rjt
o
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
has
a
few
shortcoming
but
overall

pretty
rich

a
small
white
foamy
1finger

that
hangs
around
a

does
leave
some
spotty
lacing
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
cinnamon
slightly
above
average
for
carbonation
as
there
was
small
streams
of
bubbles
rising
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
sides
even
the
taste
was
about
the
same
as
the
smell
a
little
watered
down
as
this
is
a
large
commercial
company
fat
tire
overall
it
wasnt
that
bad
overall
a
lighter
pumpkin
beer
too
heavy
on
the
spices
too
light
on
the
beer
not
too
bad
i
have
to
say
i
was
expecting
something
a
lot
worse
a
lighter
version
of
a
winter
beer
is
what
i
would
describe
it
as
id
probably
try
it
again
o
pretty
safe
and
simple
and
decent
not
great
but
not
bad
easy
drinking
though
it
still
carries
that
patent
new
belgium
malt
profile
somehow
through
all
the
spices
and
cranberries
pumpkin
is
pretty
muted
and
definitely
more
balanced
than
other

o
its
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
i
could
see
this
going
really
well
at
your
thanksgiving
meal
due
to
the
pumpkin
spice
and
cranberry
in
this
very
festive
for
the
fall
time
the
verdict
surprisingly
good
the
pumpkin
is
very
muted
perhaps
balanced
from
the
bitter
cranberries
which
give
it
a
nice
zest
im
not
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
generally
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
overall
not
a
bad
fall
seasonal
but
the
adjunct
flavors
are
a
bit
over
done
there
are
better
fall
seasonals
and
pumpkin
beers
overall
eh
worth
a
try
if
you
like
cranberry
wouldnt
buy
a
sixer
though
just
one
to
try
o
very
disappointing
pairing
pumpkin
with
cranberry
is
a
fantastic
idea
and
id
love
to
see
new
belgium
do
it
right
this
beer
might
pair
well
with
a
rich
thanksgiving
dinner
but
on
its
own
the
shortcomings
are
too
overwhelming
to
recommend
o
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
i
would
order
again
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
was
brewed
with
cranberry
juice
didnt
really
didnt
taste
any
of
it
though
why
such
bad
reviews
this
is
made
with
pumpkin
juice
and
cranberry
juice
never
heard
of
juicing
a
pumpkin
but
it
seems
to
work
well
in
this
new
seasonal
the
pour
is
as
one
would
expect
orange
tinted
mostly
clear
bubbly
and
with
an
inch
of
so
of
lazy
white
head
it
smells
a
little
tart
from
the
cranberry
and
i
taste
that
element
first
too
the
pumpkin
is
in
the
second
half
of
both
aroma
and
flavor
and
its
gentle
not
overly
spiced
or
covered
up
with
sugar
or
too
big
of
a
malt
i
think
that
aspect
of
this
beer
is
quite
well
done
there
is
lemongrass
too
supposedly
which
i
guess
must
contribute
this
tropical
lightness
thats
not
usually
found
in
fall
beer
well
carbonated
too
it
stays
light
despite
all
the
robust
flavors
pumpkin
beer
with
a
twist
not
totally
successful
but
an
enjoyable
take
on
the
fall
classic
i
will
buy
more
this
season
for
sure
pours
out
a
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
head
light
spice
toast
pumpkin
in
the
nose
pumpkin
and
spice
are
subtle
lots
of
toast
as
with
99
of
new
belgium
stuff
i
suppose
its
the
yeast
strain
slight
tartness
of
the
cranberry
i
dont
pick
up
the
lemongrass
thank
god
mouthfeel
is
thinnish
with
prickly
bubbles
this
is
decent
like
a
slightly
pumpkiny
fat
tire
once
you
adjust
this
is
a
decent
and
almost
refreshing
ale
though
it
is
decidedly
a
novelty
beer
which
i
am
unlikely
to
revisit
low
c
o
new
belgium
could
do
better
no
kick
to
this
pumpkin
beer
pumpkick
has
a
slight
edge
over
the
usual
pumpkin
ales
the
mild
cranberry
character
and
good
use
of
spice
is
just
that
worth
a
go
semihazy
light
orange
color
with
half
a
finger
of
off
white
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
smells
like
tart
cranberry
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
taste
is
mostly
tart
and
sweet
cranberry
with
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
spice
only
having
a
low
presence
sweet
and
sticky
with
moderate
carbonation
its
a
good
take
on
a
pumkin
ale
the
cranberry
adds
a
different
dimension
with
tartness
o
dont
let
this
drink
warm
up
too
much
because
that
bitterness
gets
fairly
strong
this
brew
even
though
delicious
should
just
be
classified
as
a
herbed
spiced
beer
the
pumpkin
barely
stands
out
quite
delicious
if
not
looking
for
a
pumpkin
ale
and
instead
looking
for
a
nice
spice
holiday
brew
pours
a
clear
copper
color
34
inch

an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
pumpkin
hops
sweet
malt
nutmeg
hint
of
cinnamon
hint
of
sugar
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
fits
the
style
of
a
pumpkin
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pumpkin
sweet
malt
hint
of
yeast
slight
nutmeg
hint
of
earthy
malt
hops
and
slight
alcohol
overall
i
really
like
how
the
pumpkin
is
more
of
a
addition
than
the
dominant
flavor
also
i
enjoy
the
spices
being
as
subtle
as
they
are
in
the
body
the
blend
is
amazing
a
rather
bland
pumpkin
ale
o
all
in
all
decent
but
it
seems
like
it
is
holding
on
to
summer
instead
of
diving
into
fall
and
i
should
call
it
cheating
that
they
used
pumpkin
juice
but
it
seems
to
work
well
enough
here
still
i
prefer
when
real
fresh
pumpkin
is
used
o
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
overall
id
like
more
depth
and
presence
from
the
cranberries
but
its
not
bad
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
ok
but
i
wouldnt
call
this
one
of
my
top
pumpkin
ales
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
tulip
orange
pumpkin
color
with
nice
lacing
bready
spice
aroma
mild
but
pleasant
taste
is
similar
caramel
biscuit
bready
spices
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
well
balanced
and
really
easy
to
drink
yet
another
pumpkin
ale
but
its
actually
a
decent
one
not
sure
why
there
are
so
many
bad
reviews
its
a
good
run
of
the
mill
pumpkin
id
get
again
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
httpyoutu
bepozlhbi0f0
where
this
beer
falls
apart
for
me
is
on
the
palate
what
i
was
expecting
was
two
great
tastes
which
play
well
together
at
least
thematically
and
the
elements
are
therei
can
taste
the
pumpkin
well
pumpkin
extract
as
it
lends
a
rounded
malty
sweetness
to
the
beer
and
contrasts
with
a
tart
cranberry
sharpness
but
they
dont
play
well
together
and
the
dry
lingering
and
somewhat
unpleasant
finish
like
licking
a
piece
of
chalk
doesnt
help
avoid
really
surprised
this
isnt
rated
higher
maybe
its
the
tequila
shots
i
took
earlier
or
maybe
its
the
terrible
pumpkin
and
oktoberfest
beers
ive
had
this
season
but
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
change
of
pace
well
blended
flavor
average
look
and
smell
but
an
enjoyable
brew
im
not
a
new
belgium
fan
at
all
but
this
beer
is
everything
they
promise
just
look
at
the
name
pumpkick
o
let
me
say
that
i
appreciate
and
understand
the
concept
behind
this
brew
but
i
really
can
say
it
works
for
me
the
cranberry
is
interesting
but
ruins
the
roasty
and
rich
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
expected
in
a
pumpkin
beer
this
is
not
anything
i
would
ever
purchase
again
but
it
wasnt
totally
horrible
considering
the
take
on
the
style
again
i
applaud
new
belgium
for
stepping
outside
the
box
cheers
o
good
looking
beer
with
great
aroma
that
was
deceiving
before
the
taste
a
strange
layer
of
acidity
was
pretty
much
throughout
the
whole
taste
with
very
little
sweetness
prickly
carbonation
and
light
body
through
me
for
more
clashing
gourd
flavored
beer
loops
not
sure
the
direction
or
interpretation
they
were
attempting
but
this
ended
up
being
a
miss
when
it
started
so
promising
o
very
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
i
like
how
the
cranberry
cuts
the
sweet
of
all
te
spices
that
is
a
nice
take
on
this
style
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
persistent
head
and
some
solid
lacing
nose
is
pumpkin
and
fall
spice
roasted
grain
with
hefty
amounts
of
pumpkin
and
a
bit
of
a
bitter
fruitiness
yet
not
sweet
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
t
tasted
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
allspice
malt
a
little
bit
of
cinnamon
and
some
cranberry
it
reminds
me
of
drinking
tea
with
spice
and
with
some
raspberry
instead
of
cranberry
its
an
orange
and
amber
color
beer
its
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
pumpkin
beers
i
like
this
beer
but
you
cant
a
lot
at
once
max
two
beers
from
a
6pack
s
a
decent
aroma
of
pumpkin
spices
and
fruit
pours

mostly
clear
amber

berries
and
some
bready

sweet

too
much

not
enough

couple
of
millimeters
thick
great
clarity
with
this
beer
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
a
touch
of
cranberry
following
in
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
as
their
is
some
alcohol
here
but
it
is
pretty
smooth
considering
all
of
those
ingredients
i
get
the
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
on
the
palate
at
the
back
i
get
the
spiciness
of
cinnamon
and
perhaps
from
the
hops
i
get
the
pinpricks
on
the
tongue
i
get
just
shiny
of
cranberry
in
the
aftertaste
it
was
used
subtly
and
that
was
wise
i
like
a
but
more
pumpkin
flavoring
in
my
pumpkin
beers
but
its
a
good
brew
o
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
im
at
a
loss
to
explain
the
low
score
it
has
on
this
site
still
a
drinkable
beer
new
belgium
was
very
careful
not
to
go
too
overboard
with
this
beer
the
pumpkin
is
highlighted
and
the
addition
of
cranberry
juice
slight
otherwise
its
a
straight
forward
amber
with
some
pumpkin
and
fall
spice
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
pours
an
murky
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
slight
cranberry
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
tart
berry
and
pumpkin
pie
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
smells
pretty
good
with
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
working
well
with
the
cranberry
but
the
taste
of
these
two
aspects
does
not
mesh
all
that
well
in
my
opinion
aroma
is
cinnamonspices
mild
vegetative
notes
and
hints
of
pumpkin
and
cranberries
the
flavor
is
pumpkin
cranberries
mild
spices
fruit
and
a
tart
finish
the
cranberries
were
different
for
the
style
as
a
whole
this
was
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
overall
decent
but
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
that
ive
had
nor
is
the
best
from
new
belgium
that
ive
tried
needs
more
pumpkin
flavoring
o
another
interesting
spin
on
the
pumpkin
beer
the
cranberry
tartness
is
an
interesting
addition
and
makes
the
beer
a
little
less
sweet
overall
and
a
little
easier
to
drink
enjoyable
though
not
the
best
or
the
worst
pumpkin
beer
i
have
tried
picked
up
nbs
new
fall
seasonal
poured
into
globe
glass
nice
pour
good
coloring
burnt
amber
with
a
thick
head
faint
scents
of
sweet
pumpkin
spice
cinnamon
not
bad
flavor
pumpkin
taste
is
subtle
not
overbearing
and
not
synthetic
at
all
the
tartness
from
the
cranberries
is
a
nice
touch
nice
balance
with
the
overall
maltiness
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airy
overall
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
and
worth
picking
up
very
drinkable
i
liked
this
better
than
i
expected
im
not
a
fan
of
new
belgium
most
pumpkin
ales
are
hit
or
miss
and
this
is
closer
to
hit
than
miss
a
good
beer
just
could
have
done
some
things
differently
to
make
it
better
easy
to
drink
not
a
session
beer
but
the
alcohol
that
is
there
is
very
well
hidden
i
bought
a
sixer
and
im
pretty
happy
i
didnt
go
for
the
single
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
and
i
am
not
surprised
great
start
but
tough
ending
taste
brings
down
mouthfeel
and
thats
all

i
bit
on
the
sour
side
as
might
be
expected
from
cranberries
light
bodied
with
active
peppery
carbonation
an
interesting
take
on
an
pumpkin

but
not
my
preference
for
malt
body
a
bit
too
light
malt
and
a
bit
too
sour
the
beer
is
only
modestly
sour
but
perhaps
unbalanced
by
it
interesting
but
not
in
my
list
of
favorite
pumpkins
i
am
a
little
confused
by
this
beer
and
what
nbb
is
going
for
i
wouldnt
suggest
spending
your
weekly
beer
money
on
this
season
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
new
belgium
globe
appearance
is
a
bright
pumpkin
orange
color
with
nice
clarity
velvety
white
head
with
heavy
lacing
a
nice
retention
nose
starts
with
heavy
fleshy
pumpkin
character
that
comes
off
in
a
vegetal
way
mild
notes
of
allspice
and
clove
follow
that
and
not
much
cranberry
character
to
speak
of
maybe
a
tinge
of
cran
tartness
at
the
finish
taste
is
very
nondescript
in
terms
of
pumpkin
character
there
is
a
wave
of
light
cranberry
tartness
that
seems
to
neutralize
the
pumpkin
spices
the
spice
picks
up
a
bit
towards
the
finish
with
allspice
being
the
most
prominent
note
the
flavors
are
a
little
muddled
which
seems
to
make
this
beer
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
very
mild
flavored
pumpkin
ale
and
he
cranberry
doesnt
come
through
in
that
thanksgiving
dinner
kind
of
way
come
to
think
of
it
im
not
really
sure
why
cranberry
is
being
paired
with
pumpkin
in
the
first
place
it
works
with
turkey
and
stuffing
but
cant
say
ive
ever
really
paired
it
with
pumpkin
pie
but
i
digress
this
one
is
very
forgettable
overall
its
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
at
all
not
my
fav
but
pretty
tasty
amber
with
a
solid
quilt
of
near
bone
white
foam
smells
of
allspice
cranberry
juice
some
grain
and
plenty
more
cranberries
but
sweet
too
bad
the
cranberries
arent
more
like
serendipity
that
was
a
yummy
beer
flavor
is
malt
mild
spice
raisin
sweet
muddled
overall
and
kinda
bland
even
for
a
pumpkin
beer
medium
bodied
with
light
carb
and
a
wet
finish
this
beer
was
subpar
overall
this
is
by
no
means
great
but
my
expectations
were
pretty
low
this
is
a
pretty
good
fall
seasonal
that
i
will
likely
buy
a
couple
more
bottles
of
new
belgium
has
really
let
me
down
lately
this
is
one
to
avoid
a
bad
example
of
a
style
that
has
plenty
of
clunkers
o
the
presence
of
the
pumpkin
and
spice
is
topnotch
in
pumpkick
really
landing
in
a
flavorfulyetdrinkable
zone
thats
perfect
for
its
late
fall
release
not
too
heavy
or
sweet
but
just
right
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
goto
fall
beers
this
year
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
beer
and
a
fairly
average
example
of
the
style
the
aroma
was
going
in
the
right
direction
but
when
it
got
to
the
taste
all
the
malt
aspects
that
were
missing
in
the
aroma
showed
up
in
the
taste
a
little
too
much
so
pushing
the
flavors
that
were
supposed
to
be
showcased
into
the
background
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
smooth
and
not
filling
but
the
taste
didnt
do
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
would
be
enough
for
me
but
if
i
was
offered
a
few
of
these
i
could
probably
dink
them
but
i
dont
think
i
would
enjoy
them
that
much
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
nice
and
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
pretty
bland
with
not
much
life
to
it
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
12
is
enough
for
me
for
the
season
and
i
think
ill
save
one
or
two
of
these
for
october
to
see
if
my
opinion
has
changed
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
as
a
good
pumpkin
beer
its
priced
nicely
but
its
not
really
a
bang
for
your
buck
all
in
all
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
when
it
comes
to
pumpkin
beers
it
falls
right
in
the
middle
it
wasnt
great
or
memorable
by
any
means
but
there
wasnt
anything
offensive
about
it
new
belgium
is
a
pretty
solid
brewery
but
i
think
they
missed
the
mark
with
this
one
and
i
would
like
it
better
if
the
pumpkin
and
cranberry
flavors
were
highlighted
more
better
luck
next
time
guys
o
a
good
example
of
a
spice
herb
veg
beer
a
bit
more
to
offer
than
the
typical
pumpkin
with
some
interesting
additions
i
like
that
neither
the
spice
nor
malt
took
over
to
overwhelmed
the
flavors
overall
this
is
a
fun
fall
seasonal
for
sure
could
have
called
it
cran
kick
fun
session
beer
but
i
would
only
drink
in
the
fall
reminds
me
of
jumping
into
a
pile
of
leaves
o
not
a
terrible
experience
but
not
an
amazing
one
either
this
beer
delivers
what
the
label
promises
at
least
in
a
world
full
of
upandcoming
breweries
who
push
the
envelope
with
fall
seasonal
pumpkin
beers
this
one
stands
right
in
the
middle
of
the
road
for
me
with
monsters
like
southern
tier
warlock
pumpking
saint
arnold
pumpkinator
rogue
pumpkin
patch
and
dfh
punkin
out
there
this
one
is
decent
but
not
mindblowing
however
if
you
want
a
pumpkin
beer
that
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
that
also
packs
a
decent
punch
that
just
might
club
you
over
the
head
and
then
take
your
wallet
when
you
arent
looking
give
it
a
try
you
might
not
be
too
impressed
but
you
wont
necessarily
be
let
down
either
cheers
alright
is
there
some
place
where
i
can
get
a
bottle
or
can
or
carton
or
whatever
of
pumpkin
juice
am
i
missing
something
i
didnt
even
know
you
could
juice
a
pumpkin
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
auburnbronze
topped
by
a
finger
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
white
toast
a
pinch
of
clove
a
halfpinch
of
cinnamon
a
halfdash
of
brown
sugar
mild
caramel
and
a
strange
miniundertow
of
what
seems
like
chicken
gravy
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
spices
all
blending
together
into
a
muddled
stream
of
nearnothingness
that
culminates
in
a
gulf
of
rather
hard
water
this
also
serves
to
water
down
the
caramel
a
bit
still
no
sign
of
the
cranberry
though
there
is
a
tinge
in
the
back
of
the
finish
but
that
could
just
be
psychosomatic
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
a
pretty
meek
little
beer
one
that
not
only
doesnt
bring
the
spice
but
one
that
doesnt
really
try
to
express
itself
in
much
of
any
way
boo
this
o
not
bad
but
there
was
no
kick
as
the
label
suggested
a
higher
ratio
of
malt
and
pumpkin
to
water
may
have
elevated
this
from
forgettable
to
truly
tasty
its
a
shame
its
alright
its
different
than
typical
pumpkin
ales
and
im
okay
with
that
i
like
the
tartness
in
this
beer
though
i
barely
get
a
hint
of
a
fruit
flavor
and
it
all
tastes
rather
mild
overall
relatively
forgettable
though
id
probably
choose
this
over
some
of
the
super
spicy
pumpkin
beers
out
there
pumpkick
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
small
but
lacing
head
there
is
a
strong
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
aroma
the
taste
has
a
strong
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
flavor
with
just
hints
of
sweetness
and
tartness
from
the
cranberries
great
full
body
nice
strong
complex
flavors
overall
a
fantastic
and
fruity
pumpkin
ale
o
a
dont
know
what
im
gonna
do
with
the
other
2
bottles
i
have
glad
i
was
able
to
split
it
with
someone
wish
i
could
had
split
it
with
2
people
o
i
would
not
feel
honest
if
i
rated
this
beer
at
anything
above
2
5
overall
the
flavor
isnt
there
the
mouthfeel
is
nearly
there
but
too
weak
and
there
is
much
to
be
desired
on
the
scent
i
wouldnt
recommend
the
beer
overall
an
ok
pumpkin
ale
if
you
want
a
beer
that
is
mildly
flavored
this
is
the
beer
for
you
if
you
want
bold
flavors
this
isnt
the
beer
you
are
looking
for
first
pumpkin
beer
and
im
excited
to
try
more
i
know
there
are
probably
some
fantastic
pumpkin
beers
out
there
especially
ones
made
with
real
pumpkin
however
i
enjoyed
this
beer
alot
and
i
think
the
cranberry
tartness
makes
this
beer
delicious
sourcing
purchased
at
heb
in
texas
on
08062013
for
7
99sixpack
plus
tax
overall
a
bit
of
a
letdown
might
be
better
if
they
waited
and
used
real
pumpkin
rather
than
releasing
in
july
the
beer
pours
slightly
hazy
amber
with
lots
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
and
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aromas
of
pumpkin
and
cranberry
are
present
i
also
get
some
mild
earthiness
and
along
with
the
cinamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
spice
is
present
in
the
front
and
back
along
with
plenty
of
pumpkin
and
cranberry
you
would
never
guess
this
beer
is
6
abv
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
spritzy
carbonation
this
beer
still
drinks
pretty
easy
despite
that
this
is
a
very
good
beer
this
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
pumpkin
and
cranberry
i
cant
say
what
would
make
a
person
think
that
pumpkin
and
cranberry
should
be
mixed
together
but
it
does
have
a
very
interesting
taste
drinks
very
smooth
2
why
not
omit
the
cranberry
and
just
make
a
solid
malty
pumpkin
ale
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
but
like
some
others
it
just
wasnt
balanced
too
much
on
the
sweet
its
a
good
brew
not
sweet
or
candylike
which
is
a
problem
with
several
of
the
more
popular
pumpkins
not
overspiced
its
moderate
in
all
areas
to
include
carbonation
and
really
makes
a
nice
beer
to
open
after
work
pours
a
dark
clear
ruby
amber
with
a
medium
beige
head
aroma
is
of
mild
pumpkin
nutmeg
some
cinnamon
spices
notes
of
caramel
malt
become
more
prevalent
as
it
warms
up
taste
similar
to
aroma
with
some
mild
bitterness
a
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
on
the
palate
caramel
malt
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
mild
cinnamon
spices
and
mild
bitterness
on
the
end
not
as
cloying
and
overly
sweet
as
some
other
pumpkin
brews
but
nothing
really
stellar
either
overall
an
ok
drinking
brew
for
a
pumpkin
brew
o
a
good
exemplar
of
a
muchmaligned
style
although
not
something
to
seek
out
overall
for
the
style
this
one
is
a
better
beer
it
blends
just
enough
of
the
spice
and
just
enough
pumpkin
flavor
to
make
it
work
i
do
suggest
it
but
in
limited
quantities
copperambaer
colour
with
a
big
head
and
big
lace
that
never
seem
to
vanish
smell
of
fruits
and
spices
smoked
pepper
cardamom
medium
to
light
body
soft
palate
taste
of
cardamom
smoked
touch
pepper
fruits
caramel
overall
mixed
feelings
it
started
nice
spices
werent
overpowering
but
dont
get
a
whole
lot
of
pumpkin
and
plenty
of
sweet
syrupy
characters
thankfully
also
not
too
much
but
still
not
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
glass
but
not
that
bad
just
a
little
bland
and
watery
and
has
a
slightly
offputting
dry
finish
like
theres
too
much
hop
or
spice
that
builds
up
pretty
tasty
i
could
definitely
see
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
while
watching
football
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
little
on
the
light
side
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
pumpkin
ale
this
one
meets
all
requirements
overall
this
is
solid
with
a
more
bready
malt
take
on
the
style
overall
its
a
really
good
pumpkin
beer
if
youre
a
fan
of
strongly
spiced
pumpkin
beers
it
probably
wouldnt
be
fr
you
if
you
want
just
enough
pumpkin
spice
to
remind
you
that
it
is
the
fall
my
recommendation
is
to
try
it
what
i
really
like
is
that
the
base
beer
is
tasty
enough
to
stand
by
itself
even
if
you
arent
a
fan
of
pumpkin
spice
the
nice
toasted
flavor
in
the
beer
really
makes
this
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
im
going
to
pick
up
some
more
exceptional
pumpkin
ale
with
a
balanced
profile
and
not
too
overwhelming
pumpkin
pie
flavor
the
aftertaste
brings
home
the
sweetness
of
the
pumpkin
and
solidifies
this
as
a
wellrounded
seasonal
ale
the
aroma
was
very
subtle
though
with
not
much
to
offer
once
again
anderson
valley
does
it
right
overall
your
average
craft
pumpkin
ale
drinkable
but
not
very
rewarding
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
but
this
does
not
make
my
short
list
of
pumpkin
ales
worthy
of
buying
had
a
draft
at
the
nantahala
outdoor
center
with
lunch
really
solid
flavorful
pumpkin
ale
with
great
sessionability
hits
the
right
spice
notes
for
me
some
cinnamon
a
hint
of
nutmeg
some
pie
crust
just
a
little
pumpkin
not
too
overpowering
just
subtle
and
balanced
great
slick
mouthfeel
my
first
pumpkin
ale
in
a
few
years
and
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
good
strong
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
aromas
and
flavours
but
a
lot
of
spice
and
not
enough
pumpkin
good
amber
colour
but
a
bit
thin
for
a
beer
with
so
much
flavour
price
point
1
6712
oz
bottle
not
too
sweet
or
overly
pumpkiny
liked
it
so
what
stands
out
about
this
one
spice
and
brown
sugar
flavors
the
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
are
pretty
loud
here
if
you
like
heavy
spice
in
your
pumpkin
beers
fall
hornin
will
deliver
dark
pour
that
is
not
quite
black
but
has
some
red
and
brown
highlights
has
a
tan
one
finger
head
aroma
is
lightly
spicy
with
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
standing
out
taste
follows
the
nose
with
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
flavors
but
also
can
taste
gingerbread
brown
sugar
and
a
very
light
pumpkin
presence
i
like
it
all
except
the
body
here
quite
a
few
watery
drinking
pumpkin
ales
this
year
not
sure
why
but
i
like
them
heavier
than
this
one
despite
its
darker
amber
look
its
so
fizzy
and
thin
that
it
feels
more
like
a
soda
than
a
beer
the
head
is
like
a
soda
float
too
huge
bubbles
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
activity
in
this
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
great
though
a
hit
of
ginger
in
there
with
the
nutmeg
and
the
pumpkin
nicely
selected
amber
malt
base
which
i
think
is
the
right
platform
for
these
flavors
i
just
want
it
to
be
a
bigger
contributor
to
the
feel
white
pepper
and
brown
sugar
i
the
finish
if
this
had
more
body
to
stand
on
it
would
be
a
real
impressive
brew
just
enough
hops
to
balance
the
finish
too
i
think
the
recipe
is
close
to
being
a
real
winner
yay
for
a
pumpkin
beer
in
a
can
ive
had
many
a
pumpkin
beer
and
actually
found
this
one
to
be
fairly
tasty
the
pumpkin
spice
flavors
are
there
but
not
overpowering
other
nuances
of
the
beer
definitely
one
of
the
more
balanced
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
2
85
have
i
mentioned
i
dont
care
for
most
pumpkin
ales
yet
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
with
an
impressive
head
firm
spice
backbone
plenty
of
pumpkin
flavor
and
a
darker
character
than
most
medium
body
slightly
chewy
just
enough
spices
and
pumpkins
to
balance
out
a
nice
malt
bill
overall
far
less
than
exemplary
barely
average
really
with
little
to
support
a
return
visitation
nowadays
there
are
innumerable
better
pumpkin
beers
i
like
the
color
scheme
and
artwork
on
this
can
but
i
have
to
say
i
dont
get
the
fall
hornin
name
i
dont
understand
what
that
means
but
whatever
this
beer
pours
really
dark
brown
with
a
nice
head
a
lot
of
pumpkins
dont
really
get
a
lot
of
suds
but
this
one
does
aroma
is
malty
and
herbal
spiced
and
has
another
buttery
element
which
really
comes
through
in
the
flavor
as
with
a
lot
of
other
pumpkins
i
dont
get
much
pumpkin
mostly
spice
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
a
lot
lighter
than
i
expected
with
how
dark
it
is
in
color
and
good
carbonation
i
do
like
this
beer
and
think
its
a
nice
take
on
the
style
the
aftertaste
isnt
bad
a
bit
of
dark
malt
comes
up
and
a
booziness
as
i
drink
this
i
keep
lowering
the
rating
it
is
a
disappointing
brew
from
a
great
brewer
cant
wait
to
try
the
barrel
aged
version
another
interesting
beer
from
anderson
this
one
pours
a
nice
dark
pumpkin
the
aroma
and
taste
are
slightly
subdued
and
that
is
ok
because
it
allows
the
pumkin
taste
to
come
out
naturally
and
not
be
overpowered
by
too
many
spices
the
pumpkin
is
a
natural
flavor
and
this
beer
is
light
yet
still
refreshing
and
satisfying
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
creamier
white
head
the
head
mostly
leaves
quickly
but
a
little
hangs
on
to
leave
a
small
amount
of
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
distinctly
pumpkin
but
real
pumpkin
not
the
candycorn
pumpkin
pieesque
smell
of
other
pumpkin
ales
there
is
also
a
hint
of
the
spices
the
taste
is
savory
with
the
pumpkins
gourd
qualities
front
and
center
and
the
spice
backing
it
up
it
all
comes
together
on
the
finish
the
body
is
thicker
and
theres
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
pumpkin
beer
id
drink
again
overall
its
an
easy
going
great
tasting
pumpkin
beer
that
doesnt
way
you
down
in
anywayvery
nice
beer
here
folks
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
as
this
was
the
first
pumpkin
ale
id
seen
from
anderson
valley
but
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
this
season
will
recommend
this
one
to
friends
as
it
was
smooth
with
lots
of
mild
fall
flavors
while
still
presenting
a
nice
pumpkin
flavor
excellent
overall
really
pretty
good
im
pretty
new
to
pumpkin
beers
but
its
like
drinking
pie
a
big
thanks
to
anderson
valley
and
many
other
breweries
this
year
for
putting
these
out
so
early
i
keep
forgetting
halloween
is
in

o
is
a
good
introduction
to
pumpkin
beer
for
the
uninitiated
big
thanks
to
jimbo
for
bringing
me
a
portion
of
the
new
can
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
tawny
sienna
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
maple
syrup
granola
light
molasses
toasted
pumpkin
seeds
and
a
relatively
mild
blend
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
spices
blending
with
the
syrupmolassesladen
grahamcracker
malt
backbone
rather
well
ensuring
neither
faction
attains
too
much
authority
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thickly
fluid
feel
overall
a
rather
nice
pumpkin
ale
one
that
doesnt
dropkick
you
with
spice
or
booze
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
sixers
of
this
during
this
upcoming
pumpkin
ale
season
a
big
thanks
to
the
creator
of
the
canquest
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
pumpkin
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
the
smell
some
pumpkin
malts
a
bit
of
spice
very
drinkable
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
a
perfectly
serviceable
pumpkin
beer
porterish
brownish
and
easy
to
drink
with
muted
but
present
pie
spices
but
perhaps
no
real
silkiness
from
any
real
pumpkin
still
it
hits
the
spot
without
filling
you
up
too
much
is
a
bit
different
from
some
of
the
other
pumpkin
beers
and
is
conveniently
in
cans
ive
bought
more
than
one
sixer
and
enjoyed
it
o
surprisingly
good
not
sickly
sweet
or
synthetic
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
overall
not
a
bad
beer
very
easy
to
drink
but
no
where
near
the
top
of
the
food
chain
when
it
comes
to
pumpkin
beers
its
good
to
have
for
the
moment
and
definitely
still
better
than
some
other
beers
that
try
harder
salud
overall
a
very
tasty
and
gourd
forward
punpkin
ale
my
pour
netted
me
a
finger
of
dense
tawny
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
copper
srm
22
27
with
nequality
clarity
great
lacing
began
to
form
as
the
head
fell
the
nose
smelled
like
a
yankee
candle
thanks
to
a
heavy
seeming
presence
of
vanilla
to
go
along
with
the
other
spices
i
am
unsure
just
how
i
feel
about
this
as
it
is
different
but
i
have
also
tried
a
lot
of
different
pumpkins
this
year
and
for
this
to
just
appear
is
wondrous
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
and
i
am
beginning
to
wonder
if
that
is
not
a
construct
of
the
spices
interacting
with
the
yeast
in
some
way
it
was
not
quite
creamy
but
it
was
on
the
approach
cinnamon
was
the
prevalent
spice
but
clove
and
ginger
were
also
in
the
mix
and
so
was
the
vanilla
flavor
noted
on
the
nose
finish
was
semidry
with
the
malt
getting
a
chance
to
offset
the
spices
overall
it
was
better
than
many
but
not
as
good
as
some
ymmv
o
its
a
nice
change
to
see
a
darker
pumpkin
ale
i
loved
how
it
smelled
i
found
myself
inhaling
deep
whiffs
of
this
one
the
initial
flavor
was
good
but
after
23
of
the
bottle
the
palate
kind
of
gets
tired
of
it
needs
just
a
bit
more
body

taste
has
a
balance
flavor
of
pumpkin

spice
is
a
little
more
than
i
like
but
it
is
still
a
good
beer
it
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
overall
a
well
done
pumpkin
beer
a
very
well
done
pumpkin
beer
prominent
pumpkin
pie
spices
without
being
overwhelming
or
cloying
overall
wow
this
is
an
exceptional
exceptional
pumpkin
beer
i
love
the
huge
amounts
of
spice
which
is
beautifully
balanced
with
the
pumpkin
sweetness
malt
and
hops
im
definitely
getting
some
more
of
this
and
its
definitely
being
added
to
my
yearly
pumpkin
rotation
its
absolutely
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
overall
this
is
good
but
the
spices
dominate
the
pumpkin
big
time
would
buy
again
mouthfeel
mediumlight
some
of
the
spices
have
moments
of
astringency
and
drying
character
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
if
you
like
cinnamon
but
it
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
having
pumpkin
aromas
and
flavors
o
i
have
to
say
i
am
disappointed
with
this
beer
this
is
nothing
more
than
an
average
maybe
even
slightly
below
average
pumpkin
ale
pumpkin
pumpkin
pie
spices
thats
it
every
store
in
my
area
has
this
from
12
9913
99
for
a
6pack
that
is
outrageous
i
saw
that
and
automatically
thought
that
the
beer
must
have
something
special
or
maybe
it
was
just
damn
good
luckily
i
only
purchased
two
in
a
mixasix
at
my
local
beverage
center
this
beer
should
be
in
the
8
9910
99
price
range
just
like
the
other
sixpacks
of
average
pumpkin
beers
right
next
to
it
on
the
shelf
the
ufo
sam
adams
smuttynose
pumpkin
ales
are
just
a
few
that
are
much
better
how
a
brewery
or
a
store
could
offer
this
product
at
such
a
price
is
ridiculous
i
will
never
buy
this
again
why
pay
14
00
for
a
sixpack
of
beer
when
there
are
a
dozen
more
representations
of
the
style
that
are
much
better
and
for
4
005
00
less
overall
this
pumpkin
beer
weighs
in
on
the
pumpkin
side
of
this
type
of
beer
the
spices
and
sweetness
dont
overwhelm
the
palate
like
many
of
this
style
do
well
balanced
for
a
change
overall
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
might
have
to
get
a
few
more
before
the
season
is
over
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
fall
seasonal
that
just
needs
a
little
something
to
elevate
it
from
good
to
great

without
going
overboard
on
anything
the
spicing
is
distinct
but
did
not
overwhelm
the
pumpkin
there
are
some
truly
awful
as
well
as
supurb
pumpkin
ales
out
there
and
this
is
one
of
the
good
guys
overall
the
beer
had
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
drinking
much
closer
to
what
a
soda
feels
like
and
the
canned
taste
only
added
to
this
sensation
after
the
exceptional
looking
head
and
appearance
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
alas
it
wasnt
quite
up
to
snuff
and
nowhere
near
as
good
as
yesterdays
fat
jack
let
it
warm
a
bit
to
bring
out
the
pumpkin
flavors
overall
coming
into
this
i
was
really
into
this
beer
and
it
proved
to
be
interesting
and
tasteful
the
combination
of
spices
pumpkin
and
some
maltiness
all
went
well
together
and
just
overall
wellbalanced
i
would
have
this
beer
again
and
would
totally
recommend
to
a
friend
cheers
o
an
average
middle
of
the
road

smooth
at

except
for
the

overall
if
this

had
replicated
the
aroma
in
the
taste
itwould
have
been
a
4
0
too
much
cinnamon
its
like
cinnamon
chewing
gum
flavours
overall
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
it
again
but
its
a
fairly
tasty
fall
time
treat
as
always
i
crave
spice
so
elysian
night
owl
is
my
go
to
pumpkin
ale
o
a
very
good
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
definitely
drinkable
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
lacks
on
sweetness
which
is
a
plus
recommended
o
pleasant
though
far
from
memorable
iam
starting
my
fall
seasonal
beer
tour
today
although
its
nearly
90
fricken
degreesstill
seems
odd
to
see
pumpkin
ales
out
when
its
this
warm
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
tawny
brown
with
a
auburn
infusiona
thinner
light
tan
colored
head
atop
buttery
notes
along
with
pumkin
spice
but
not
real
strong
nutmeg
stands
out
most
at
the
onset
of
the
palate
along
with
mace
and
graham
cracker
crustnot
bad
the
feel
was
a
bit
fizzy
and
on
the
lighter
side
wich
took
away
from
the
flavor
profile
my
first
pumpkin
beer
of
the
season
is
ok
o
i
thought
this
was
a
more
interesting
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
as
it
has
all
of
the
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
pie
spice
flavors
but
without
the
sweetness
i
usually
associate
with
the
style
and
some
light
to
moderate
amounts
of
earthiness
easy
to
drink
and
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
i
would
definitely
grab
another
of
these
overall
solid
not
envelope
pushing
spicy
pumpkin
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
get
another
six
pack
of
this
very
clean
this
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
creamy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
full
pumpkin
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
clove
spice
the
texture
is
about
average
that
will
quench
your
thirst
once
you
get
to
the
taste
though
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
to
define
this
as
a
pumpkin
beer
it
does
finish
with
a
nice
cinnamon
spice
after
taste
above
average
but
there
are
better
pumpkin
beers
on
the
market
this
is
a
decent
enough
pumkin
ale
but
i
have
had
more
pumpkinforward
examples
in
the
past
which
i
prefer
this
comes
across
as
more
of
a
spiced
beverage
pours
a
hazy
super
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
earthy
malt
and
pumpkin
pie
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
dirt
and
pumpkin
pie
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
with
a
solid
pumpkin
pie
spice
aroma
but
there
is
an
odd
dirtlike
flavor
that
i
am
not
too
fond
of
nonetheless
for
those
too
conditioned
to
have
some
hop
or
bitter
edge
to
their
beers
or
for
those
who
typically
do
not
like
any
flavor
whether
spice
fruit
or
coffee
n
chocolate
for
all
its
great
qualities
this
is
not
the
beer
for
you
one
of
the
more
pumpkin
forward
of
the
seasonal
beers
the
gingercola
overwhelms
a
bit
wouldve
preferred
it
to
be
more
subtle
to
allow
the
pumpkin
to
dominate
the
excessive
bitterness
also
detracts
a
bit
but
the
nuttiness
saves
the
day
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
with
a
lot
of
spice
would
go
well
with
holiday
foods
such
as
honey
baked
hams
and
sweet
potato
m
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
a
really
nice
pumpkin
beer
thats
a
bit
less
than
excellent
the
flavors
are
a
bit
on
the
mild
side
and
the
finish
is
forgettable
still
the
flavors
that
are
present
are
very
pleasant
balanced
and
enjoyable
the
body
is
about
medium
but
on
the
lighter
side
of
it
by
a
stretch
its
a
little
crisp
and
a
little
smooth
but
neither
very
much
its
a
solid
feel
but
nothing
that
wows
where
the
attempt
to
keep
this
pumpkin
ale
first
and
foremost
alelike
is
much
appreciated
thats
not
what
draws
us
to
these
tasty
beers
its
the
abandoning
of
traditional
recipes
in
favor
of
accenting
the
spices
with
sweetness
and
strength
is
whats
best
about
them
though
this
is
a
well
made
ale
its
certainly
not
the
guilty
pleasure
that
drives
beer
drinkers
into
a
frenzy
as
if
its
catnip
for
adults
i
often
feel
that
schlafly
pumpkin
is
the
level
by
which
all
others
are
to
be
judged
and
though
this
is
not
schlafly
this
is
very
close
to
it
drinkability
im
glad
i
bought
this
and
tried
it
ill
happily
drink
the
rest
of
the
sixpack
however
ill
definitely
not
be
coming
back
to
this
one
anytime
soon
this
is
good
beer
its
just
not
anywhere
close
to
being
good
for
a
pumpkin
ale
it
really
needs
to
step
up
its
game
to
be
able
to
hang
with
schlafly
dfh
rivertown
and
the
like
its
great
beer
no
flaws
but
it
just
misses
the
mark
for
being
a
pumpkin
ale
in
my
opinion
this
is
ultimately
a
safe
pumpkin
ale
its
fine
but
theres
nothing
about
that
makes
it
standout
from
the
pack
solid
but
run
of
the
mill
in
my
opinion
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
cans
is
a
plus
considering
this
is
a
style
that
is
rarely
seen
in
cans
got
this
on
draft
in
pittsburgh
it
was
love
at
first
sip
the
only
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
that
i
have
no
complaints
about
as
far
as
spices
flavors
are
balanced
not
overwhelming
fake
or
cloying
cant
even
tell
its
high
abv
goes
down
smooth
extra
good
with
cinnamon
sugar
rim
on
glass
love
this
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
just
wish
it
had
a
stronger
pumpkin
taste
overall
impression
a
big
bold
spiced
ale
the
upfront
pepper
and
clove
character
makes
me
think
this
was
fermented
with
a
belgian
yeast
strain
enjoyable
and
worthy
of
aging
pours
dark
amber
scant
tan
head
smells
of
pumpkins
and
pie
spices
plus
vanilla
and
booze
taste
follows
very
good
overall
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
pumpkin
sipper
as
it
warmed
it
continued
to
please
by
offering
up
additional
flavor
subtleties
it
certainly
deserves
consideration
among
the
higher
ranks
of
pumpkin
beers
o
this
is
a
really
great
pumpkin
ale
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
are
pretty
prominent
but
not
over
the
top
and
quite
a
bit
more
hop
character
than
usual
the
pie
crust
flavor
in
the
beer
was
really
impressive
this
is
very
good
i
dont
really
like
pumpkin
anything
fat
heads
once
again
took
a
blah
style
and
elevated
it
i
will
definitely
buy
another
for
next
fall
pumpkin
beers
stand
alone
its
not
a
style
that
i
particularly
love
fat
heads
absolutely
nailed
it
its
probably
the
tastiest
pure
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
found
so
far
this
year
the
appearance
could
be
improved
with
some
head
and
lacing
whats
the
surfactant
here
pumpkin
or
nutmeg
the
spices
are
not
overpowering
but
add
a
delicate
sensory
experience
the
ale
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
the
9
abv
is
not
evident
in
either
drink
or
aftertaste
instead
a
slow
heat
rises
in
the
stomach
several
minutes
after
consuming
just
a
darn
good
version
of
a
pumpkinbased
ale
it
definitely
has
a
boozy
aftertaste
but
it
is
not
unpleasant
i
am
glad
that
this
is
very
different
from
pumking
it
is
one
of
the
biggest
and
best
pumpkin

this
is

all
around
good

and
very
smooth

a

taste
is

the

are
perfectly

drinks
lighter

though
there
is
a
bit
of
alcohol
flare
up
on
the
finish
lots
of
toast
and
caramel
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
most
imperial
pumpkin
ales
not
bad
id
drink
this
again
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
on
draft
oa
good
pumpkin
ale
but
for
the
price
for
a
four
pack
the
beer
isnt
worth
it
o
not
bad
not
wowing
me
either
a
different
kind
of
pumpkin
ale
than
i
am
used
to
having
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
doesnt
really
have
anything
wrong
with
it
but
doesnt
do
anything
to
impress
me
either
drinkable
enjoyable
not
memorable
o
good
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
we
get
in
pittsburgh
although
slightly
overpriced
i
think
it
has
a
very
good
taste
and
is
well
balanced
not
too
pumpkiny
but
not
lacking
in
that
area
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
i
definitely
recommend
it
o
the
malty
sweetness
balanced
the
spices
well
the
best
part
of
this
beer
was
the
chewy
and
thick
mouthfeel
if
you
want
a
candyflavored
pumpkin
check
out
the
canned
ale
put
out
by
the
onion
brewery
this
is
okay
but
not
worth
the
price
o
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
considering
its
strength
because
only
hints
of
alcohol
are
present
in
the
taste
o
for
me
a
pumpkin
ale
is
all
about
spice
and
pumpkin
balance
and
this
one
really
comes
through
with
that
was
expecting
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
could
due
with
a
tiny
bit
more
spice
but
id
rather
have
less
than
more
a
pretty
interesting
pumpkin
ale
that
brings
a
bit
more
spice
and
a
distinct
syrupy
sweetness
that
i
havent
seen
in
other
pumpkin
beers
on
that
count
it
gets
points
for
standing
out
in
a
good
way
and
is
worth
trying
for
sure
probably
more
than
once
that
said
there
are
still
a
few
better
pumpkins
out
there
for
my
money
the
taste
is
mostly
pumpkin
spice
with
the
actual
pumpkin
taking
a
backseat
once
again
the
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
you
get
more
of
a
caramel
note
and
a
slight
toffee
note
as
well
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
middle
of
the
road
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
not
as
drinkable
as
most
of
the
others
on
the
market
but
it
a
imperial
so
thats
to
be
expected
take
a
little
time
to
drink
this
one
and
it
will
be
worth
it
o
spice
heat
they
dont
call
it
the
pumpkin
beer
with
a
kick
for
nothing
i
think
the
palate
might
have
been
a
little
too
overthetop
to
be
great
but
its
certainly
delicious
otherwise
fat
heads
continues
to
command
my
respect
the
body
is
light
but
firm
with
lots
of
bite
from
crispness
top
tier
pumpkin
beer
no
doubt
about
it
mouthfeel
this
is
a
rather
thick
brew
for
a
pumpkin
but
it
does
have
a
rather
clean
finish
and
not
to
bad
of
an
aftertaste
considering
that
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
this
isnt
the
best
pumpkin
that
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
pretty
good
effort
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
goblet
color
is
dark
golden
head
bubbles
up
but
only
slightly
aroma
is
pumpkin
medium
roasted
malt
and
spice
the
flavor
is
the
most
balanced
ive
ever
tried
for
a
pumpkin
ale
full
pumpkin
flavor
with
a
counterpoint
of
spice
neither
one
dominating
and
then
sweet
malt
there
arent
a
lot
of
hops
here
but
enough
to
give
the
beer
a
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
but
not
overly
heavy
less
so
than
dogfish
head
punkin
with
the
alcohol
very
well
hidden
i
have
never
before
had
a
pumpkin
beer
that
so
perfectly
combines
pumpkin
spice
abv
and
drinkability
poured
into
a
snifter
light
tan
head
thins
immediately
leaving
a
thin
white
ring
in
the
glass
minimal
lacing
dark
rich
amber
in
color
but
fairly
clear
sweet
pumpkin
puree
sweet
malt
with
a
some
spices
noticeable
in
aroma
taste
is
similar
with
an
added
butterycreamy
feel
to
it
aroma
and
flavor
improve
as
it
warms
its
smooth
with
a
slight
bite
on
the
end
not
terribly
hoppy
but
definitely
rather
substantive
or
chewy
as
they
say
excellent
finish
overall
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
id
give
this
one
another
shot
sometime
for
sure
i
think
id
prefer
a
bit
more
hops
but
this
good
cheers
overall
in
a
way
i
dont
like
it
just
like
i
dont
like
the
bourbon
barrel
aged
heavy
seas
pumpkin
the
alcohol
in
this
taste
like
a
regular
pumpkin
ale
with
a
shot
of
rum
or
something
added
quite
possibly
the
worst
pumpkin
ale
i
had
of
the
season
this
is
a
medium
to
fuller
bodied
brew
this
is
rare
for
me
to
say
this
but
i
think
the
alcohol
is
a
little
too
high
and
distracts
from
the
overall
experience
overall
there
are
a
lot
of
positive
and
enjoyable
things
going
on
here
if
you
havent
had
it
and
like
pumpkin
ales
this
is
a
must
nicely
done
eric
o
this
beer
was
new
this
year
and
quickly
became
a
great
go
to
pumpkin
beer
for
me
this
season
it
had
the
creamy
fuller
bodied
feel
that
i
want
these
beers
to
have
look
forward
to
havving
some
next
year
i
bought
a
single
of
this
at
belmont
party
supply
and
it
was
definitely
worth
it
you
have
to
know
what
youre
getting
yourself
into
herethis
is
a
pumpkin
ale
yes
but
its
a
strong
one
the
smell
consists
of
brown
sugar
and
pumpkin
and
in
the
taste
is
the
pumpkin
alcohol
its
not
hidden
at
all
but
actually
compliments
the
other
flavors
brown
sugar
and
butter
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
moderate
i
generally
avoid
beers
with
a
very
high
abv
as
i
find
that
the
alcohol
can
distract
from
the
taste
but
with
this
one
i
found
that
the
beer
went
down
very
easy
and
tasted
great
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
fresh
and
bold
without
being
overbearing
and
the
beer
manages
to
avoid
the
overly
sweet
taste
that
some
pumpkin
ales
struggle
with
deep
ruby
body
with
all
day
tan
khaki
head
flowing
thick
aroma
has
pumpkin
spice
and
gourd
aromatics
to
boot
perfume
like
but
so
decadent
its
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
delicious
so
drinkable
vanilla
nutmeg
clove
and
cinnamon
this
is
a
perfect
pumpkin
beer
im
glad
i
grabbed
some
great
flavor
i
will
up
date
this
when
i
buy
a
whole
four
pack
im
sad
i
just
grabbed
a
single
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
reddishcopper
color
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
offwhite
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
theres
also
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
like
nutmeg
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
pumpkin
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
nutmeg
pumpkin
ginger
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
coating
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
its
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
definitely
worth
a
try

a

aftertaste

no

texture
is
what
youd
expect
from
a
9
beer
almost
creamy
overall
this
one
really
impressed
me
so
well
balanced
for
the
style
not
overly
spicy
not
overly
malty
not
overly
pumpkinnny
reminds
me
of
pie
with
whipped
cream
on
top
well
done
fatheads
keep
bottling
these
great
brews
so
happy
to
grab
this
amazing
pumpkin
ale
excellent
pumpkin
ale
finally
an
ale
that
tastes
like
pumpkin
spice
and
everything
nice
i
have
not
had
pumking
yet
i
try
so
many
of
these
each
year
and
each
year
i
find
a
nice
fall
spiced
beer
but
nothing
with
true
pumpkin
flavor
while
its
not
overboard
and
could
be
a
little
stronger
in
taste
it
is
quite
good
the
smell
of
pumpkin
spice
cinnamon
and
sweet
pumpkin
and
a
nice
sweet
malt
delicious
i
would
not
compare
this
beer
to
pumking
that
one
is
so
distinct
its
beyond
comparison
and
i
dont
think
its
quite
as
good
as
schlaflys
that
one
has
more
pumpkin
flavor
and
a
perfect
blend
of
spices
however
this
one
definitely
holds
its
own
and
the
feel
is
to
die
for
other
than
the
lack
of
a
strong
pumpkin
flavor
im
not
sure
why
this
beer
is
getting
lukewarm
reviews
i
think
its
on
the
same
level
as
dfh
punkin
ale
and
certainly
better
than
all
but
a
handful
of
pumpkin
beers
out
there
o
a
good
effort
from
fat
heads
recommended
cheers
this
is
a
solid
imperial
pumpkin
ale
but
its
pretty
safe
and
they
dont
exactly
go
outside
of
the
box
or
try
anything
different
which
fat
heads
is
known
for
its
not
bad
but
its
not
exactly
memorable
o
decent
but
i
preferred
phantom
pumpkin
over
the
imperial
version
overall
a
fine
pumpkin
ale
from
the
world
class
brewers
at
fatheads
hides
the
alcohol
very
nice
and
has
a
great
feel
and
agreeable
flavor
o
imperial

with
a
bit

pumpkin
not
at
all
bad
but
nothing
at
all
special
pours
an
amber
orangish
color
with
a
slight
head
which
leaves
a
little
lace
the
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
along
with
the
nutmeg
and
cinnomon
the
taste
has
a
nice
pumpkin
flavor
which
is
rounded
out
by
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
along
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
moderatley
carbonated
overall
it
was
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
class
o
this
is
probably
the
strongest
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
it
was
a
little
sweet
for
me
but
overall
a
very
good
beer
notes
another
solid
beer
from

which
is
quite

there

no

the
highlight
to
this

that
i

drink
quite
a

these

not
very
good
at

overall
a
servicable
pumpkin
ale
with
some
intrique
but
falls
short
of
the
potential
of
the
style
overall
an
average
pumpkin
beer
had
better
had
worse
i
wouldnt
go
searching
for
it
but
would
accept
one
if
offered
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
just
ok
and
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
i
would
say
this
is
just
about
as
average
as
they
get
its
got
the
tell
tale
sign
of
an
average
pumpkin
beer
with
the
spices
being
the
most
dominant
aspect
and
covering
up
some
of
those
malts
and
pumpkin
flavors
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
and
not
filling
but
the
flavors
didnt
really
hold
my
attention
so
i
think
one
would
be
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
i
thought
it
was
nice
and
it
worked
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
were
the
dominating
spices
if
they
were
toned
down
some
this
beer
could
have
some
potential
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
not
hard
to
find
a
much
better
pumpkin
beer
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
as
a
good
pumpkin
beer
all
in
all
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
it
wasnt
that
great
but
it
was
still
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
is
pretty
standard
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
more
spice
than
anything
else
a
soso
fall
offering
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
there
are
a
lot
of
more
interesting
and
more
complex
pumpkin
ales
available
with
more
pumpkin
flavors
i
probably
would
not
grab
this
one
again
but
i
would
not
suggest
avoiding
it
o
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
if
you
want
a
pumpkin
pie
then
look
elsewhere
this
one
doesnt
have
a
heavy
spice
flavor
if
you
want
a
wellbalanced
beer
that
is
perfect
for
autumn
then
pick
it
up

i
liked
this
pumpkin
ale
version
i
like
a
pumpkin
beer
to
taste
of
pumpkin
and
spices
and
this
delivers
on
both
perhaps
it
is
personal
taste
but
my
wife
and
i
tried
this
and
another
brewers
pumpkin
beer
at
the
same
time
without
consultation
we
both
chose
this
one
over
the
other
overall
i
would
consider
this
the
poor
mans
pumpkin
ale
not
a
trainwreck
of
a
beer
but
one
of
the
weakest
offerings
ive
had
not
enough
flavor
and
it
feels
watered
down
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
but
if
youre
in
a
bind
and
this
is
all
you
can
get
to
satisfy
that
fall
beer
craving
try
it
out
the
subdued
flavor
might
be
good
for
someone
who
doesnt
typically
like
the
style
or
just
starting
out
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
too
highly
carbonated
it
goes
down
like
maybe
a
summer
ale
and
it
could
be
a
session
beer
if
it
didnt
cost
so
much
and
actually
tasted
alright
overall
this
is
a
mass
produced
halfhearted
attempt
at
a
pumpkin
ale
and
i
regret
buying
the
sixpack
especially
considering
that
it
cost
a
few
bucks
more
than
it
should
have
overall
i
give
this
beer
a
hearty
recommendation
if
you
are
a
pumpkin
beer
fan
this
one
definitely
shouldnt
disappoint
taste
is
pleasantly
spicy
yet
light
in
body
and
feel
and
despite
the
poor
reviews
i
find
this
to
be
an
easydrinking
subtle
pumpkin
ale
certainly
its
not
as
complex
and
layered
as
some
pumpkin
ales
out
there
but
ive
had
worse
no
problems
here
saw
this
at
abc
looks
like
a
good
holiday
brew
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
a
get
a
whiff
of
pumpkins
and
spice
and
everything
nice
starts
foaming
out
of
the
bottle
top
like
a
rabid
dog
so
i
quickly
pour
it
into
my
trusty
sapp
and
the
result
is
a
very
foamy
light
bronze
with
a
structurally
sound
head
of
offwhite
foam
on
the
taste
this
brew
has
hints
of
pumpkin
brilliant
but
otherwise
has
the
characteristics
of
a
tasty
golden
ale
the
pumkin
flavor
is
evident
up
front
and
carries
through
the
middle
but
is
then
smashed
out
gallagherlike
in
the
end
by
a
funky
semisweet
zestiness
that
then
finishes
flatly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
too
carbonated
to
carry
the
pumpkin
to
the
finish
line
all
said
this
would
be
a
good
tailgate
brew
at
your
favorite
football
game
i
think
it
would
suit
brats
and
burgers
well
not
all
that
great
as
a
sole
drinker
buffalo
bills
pumpkin
ale
35
o
avoid
this
brew
overall
nothing
about
it
really
stands
out
a
below
average
pumpkin
beer
but
not
the
worst
wouldnt
buy
again

enjoyed
the
folksy
bottle
art
but
liked
the
tasty
pumpkin
ale
even
better
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
had
all
season
not
over
spiced
so
the
pumpkin
flavor
can
be
enjoyed
i
find
most
pumpkin
ales
are
ruined
by
well
intentioned
spicers
who
mask
what
true
pumpkin
aficionados
are
looking
for
i
would
drink
this
while
playing
music
by
the
dutch
drummer
han
bennink
the
taste
has
a
nice
balance
of
spices
to
it
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
the
malt
come
through
nicely
also
the
mouth
feel
is
ok
and
overall
it
is
a
average
tasting
pumpkin
beer
o
not
bad
but
not
great
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
pay
much
for
it
all
in
all
an
average
beer
that
has
some
katchupy
pumpkin
in
it
o
i
would
label
this
as
an
average
run
of
the
mill
pumpkin
beer
does
have
some
flavor
and
does
a
good
job
of
not
adding
too
much
spice
or
nutmeg
which
can
kill
a
pumpkin
beer
sometimes
o
this
is
a
bad
beer
nothing
good
about
it
its
like
a
macro
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
orangish
copper
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
there
are
a
lot
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
in
this
beer
there
isnt
much
of
an
aroma
i
pick
up
some
pumpkin
and
some
of
those
spices
theres
some
sweetness
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
some
pumpkin
and
faint
spices
i
get
some
malt
too
there
just
isnt
much
going
on
here
theres
some
sweetness
in

flavor
as

this
is
a
disappointing
beer
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
americas
original
pumpkin
beer
its
a
wonder
this
style
ever
got
off
the
ground
this
is
inoffensive
enough
to
serve
to
nonbeer
connoisseurs
which
puts
it
ahead
of
many
pumpkin
ales
but
i
would
not
buy
this
again
cheers
lampertland
o
if
you
are
in
search
of
a
good
pumpkin
ale
to
enjoy
this
fall
move
along
there
is
nothing
to
see
here
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
that
is
gone
in
a
flash
the
aroma
smells
of
spices
and
a
modest
dose
of
pumpkin
with
little
else
to
speak
of
flavor
is
unlike
anything
ive
tried
before
a
vague
unnatural
juiciness
presents
up
front
augmented
by
a
spiciness
that
feels
out
of
place
with
such
a
watery
mouthfeel
there
is
an
almost
bilelike
quality
lurking
in
the
wash
this
initial
assault
soon
evaporates
leaving
a
mild
wheaty
haze
at
the
finish
i
think
i
may
detect
some
hops
near
the
back
end
as
well
but
its
hard
to
say
very
hard
to
find
anything
positive
to
say
here
o
there
is
little
to
offer
this
as
a
better
option
to
any
other
pumpkin
beer
not
a
bad
beer
but
hardly
a
standout
pretty
lack
luster
probably
best
to
pass
on
this
one
this
is
absolutely
disgusting
and
possibly
the
worst
pumpkin
beer
on
the
market
i
wanted
a
beernot
water
with
pumpkin
spice
disgusting
disgusting
disgusting
overall
i
enjoyed
the
smell
but
the
watered
down
fake
pumpkin
flavors
left
this
as
a
less
desirable
pumpkin
beer
o
a
decent
simple
pumpkin
beer
that
reminds
me
of
a
spiced
wheat
beer
poured
this
pumpkin
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
clear
orangish
color
produced
a
thin
white
head
featured
poor
head
retention
and
it
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
contained
pumpkin
spice
mostly
clove
medium
in
body
this
ale
had
a
foundation
of
malted
grain
cinnamon
clove
and
only
mild
pumpkin
flavor
disappointed
with
the
level
of
pumpkin
flavor
in
this
beer
only
slight
suggestions
of
hops
typical
for
the
style
semi
dry
finish
the
bottle
claims
that
his
is
americas
first
pumpkin
ale
it
generally
does
get
that
credit
i
will
say
that
while
this
is
a
decent
session
beer
i
expected
more
from
the
original
there
are
much
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
go
out
and
find
one
definitely
lacking
any
kick
or
spiciness
usually
reserved
for
pumpkin
season
the
nose
is
a
bit
sour
i
picked
up
a
sixpack
at
a
north
carolina
convenience
store
and
dont
think
i
will
ever
finish
it
with
all
the
quality
beer
in
the
asheville
area
seems
almost
like
an
oktoberfest
with
a
sprinkle
of
pumpkin
the
beer
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
and
cinnamon
with
a
few
other
assorted
spices
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
a
lot
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
notes
as
well
as
a
hint
of
cinnamon
overall
the
beer
is
lacking
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
and
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
better
pumpkin
beers
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
would
drink
this
again
but
its
far
from
my
favorite
o
its
like
a
watered
down
version
of
a
pumpkin
ale
the
flavors
and
aromas
i
get
are
good
but
they
seem
muted
i
would
like
a
stouter
version
o
i
always
look
forward
to
trying
new
pumpkin
ales
each
fall
but
this
one
was
disappointing
o
an
introductory
pumpkin
beer
poor
and
ive
got
5
more
to
drink
it
would
score
better
if
they
didnt
call
it
a
pumpkin
ale
because
it
leaves
you
wanting
something
better
in
the
grand
scheme
of
beer
its
merely
average
and
better
than
an
american
macro
any
day
its
not
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
o
meh
overall
eh
and
thats
being
generous
big
blast
of
spice
followed
by
nothing
its
like
pumpkin
soda
which
is
good
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
the
color
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
was
a
sort
of
yelloworange
with
very
little
foam
and
very
little
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
spice
was
evident
in
the
aroma
not
a
lot
of
pumpkin
flavor
but
some
bitter
spices
in
the
finish
not
what
i
expected
for
a
pumpkin
ale
just
to
bitter
and
not
alot
of
spicey
pumpkin
flavor
o
very
light
and
watery
nothing
i
would
drink
again
no
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
overall
good
lord
i
thought
this
was
the
beer
i
had
last
year
that
had
this
incredible
pumpkin
flavor
but
this
tastes
like
diluted
pumpkin
water
this
cant
possibly
be
the
same
beer
can
it
poured
into
a
black
raven
imperial
pint
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
orange
amber
thin
head
that
fizzes
out
instantaneously
but
made
an
interesting
sound
as
it
did
so
no
head
lacing
or
carbonation
light
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
taste
is
dry
pumpkin
with
a
distinct
earthy
note
that
had
a
hint
of
moldiness
finishes
with
a
slightly
sour
dry
flavor
light
bodied
not
that
good
bottle
from
wing
central
in
u
district
into
a
pint
glass
aroma
was
of
mild
pumpkin
yeast
cinnamon
and
sugar
appearance
was
very
bubbly
very
dark
orange
fizzy
and
head
leaves
quick
almost
glassy
lots
of
bubbles
stick
to
the
side
of
the
glass
its
more
like
a
pumpkin
soda
than
an
ale
taste
was
bland
pumpkins
sweet
and
not
a
really
big
profile
too
much
carbonation
with
the
sting
to
go
with
it
palate
was
sodalike
sticky
and
strong
carbonation
is
all
i
can
say
overall
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
pumpkin
beer
keep
clear
ive
spoiled
myself
having
had
pumpking
and
great
pumpkin
as
some
of
my
first
pumpkin
beers
i
really
appreciate
the
style
of
beer
having
said
that
this
is
not
a
quality
pumpkin
beer
i
can
appreciate
it
but
its
for
sure
not
a
beer
drinkers
beer
alcoholic
pumpkin
soda
im
not
fond
of
this
beer
o
overall
this
is
really
drinkable
thought
exceptionally
unremarkable
in
a
sense
it
is
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
with
just
a
hint
of
spicy
pumpkin
holding
it
up
ultimately
its
a
bit
dilute
and
subtle
versus
a
lot
of
more
direct
pumpkin
beers
out
there
o
really
just
ok
better
spiced
pumpkin
beer
in
terms
of
flavor
aroma
is
too
much
though
this
beer
pours
a
clear
orange
amber
color
it
has
about
a
finger
of
loose
sudsy
head
resting
on
top
the
head
disappears
almost
as
fast
as
it
came
leaving
no
lace
behind
as
it
falls
the
nose
is
pretty
faint
i
am
getting
some
pumpkin
sweetness
and
some
light
fall
spice
aromas
the
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
well
it
starts
off
malty
and
there
is
some
pumpkin
and
and
fall
spices
like
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
there
is
also
just
a
touch
of
hops
and
there
is
some
lingering
sweetness
in
the
finish
this
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
its
carbonation
is
pretty
high
it
is
very
tingly
but
has
a
pretty
smooth
feel
to
it
this
has
okay
drinkability
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
the
flavor
is
okay
it
has
the
pumpkin
and
spice
that
most
other
pumpkin
ales
have
but
they
are
pretty
watered
down
overall
this
is
an
alright
pumpkin
ale
it
is
worth
a
shot
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
orange
in
color
head
was
fizzy
and
dissapeared
quickly
aroma
smelled
ofsweet
pumpkin
puree
upon
first
sip
it
was
sweet
up
front
but
its
body
dissapeared
the
malt
is
almost
non
existent
ended
up
tasting
like
soda
mothfeel
was
fuzzy
and
sodalike
drain
pour
o
this
is
far
from
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
it
is
weak
and
just
lacks
a
lot
of
flavor
def
wont
buy
again
drinkability
a
nice
and
solid
pumpkin
ale
not
boundary
pushing
yet
more
complex
then
several
i
have
had
this
year
i
would
get
a
six
of
this
overall
a
pumpkin
ale
that
was
super
light
in
flavor
even
so
you
could
taste
the
pumpkin
and
spices
but
it
did
have
a
mild
vinegar
presence
at
the
finish
which
was
unusual
for
this
type
of
beer
i
was
also
surprised
to
see
it
come
in
a
twist
off
bottle
overall
good
tasting
but
lacks
complexity
and
balance
overall
drinkability
i
think
this
beer
is
great
at
what
it
does
not
my
style
but
i
can
totally
appreciate
it
its
soft
mild
balanced
flavorful
and
inoffensive
great
novelty
beer
overall
an
uninteresting
yet
swilling
pumpkin
ale
bodymedium
weight
and
fizzy
not
much
interesting
here
just
fairly
easy
drinking
i
like
it
i
see
this
as
more
of
a
pumpkin
i
want
to
drink
when
its
actually
cold
due
to
the
spice
i
like
it
although
the
pumpkin
and
spice
is
fairly
dominant
over
the
actual
beer
flavors
would
get
it
again
though
nothing
great
this
is
one
of
the
poorer
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
o
not
impressed
overall
with
this
one
the
flavors
seem
just
a
tad
off
while
it
feels
like
a
soda
instead
of
a
beer
in
your
mouth
certainly
much
better
alternatives
in
the
pumpkin
ale
department
overall
this
beer
is
definitely
something
out
of
the
ordinary
this
beer
is
like
thanksgiving
in
your
mouth
you
can
taste
the
pumpin
cinnamon
and
all
the
other
floral
smells
that
thanksgiving
has
to
offer
i
would
definatly
have
this
with
turkey
it
would
be
freakin
perfect
dont
pass
this
one
up
i
got
it
at
my
grocery
store
o
ugh
not
fun
at
all
the
carbonation
is
so
distracting
that
i
cant
gain
any
bit
of
satisfaction
theres
defiantly
a
pumpkin
presence
but
that
doesnt
save
it
from
being
sub
par
i
cant
recommend
this
to
anyone
please
look
to
other
pumpkin
ales
this
is
one
of
those
massmarket
pumpkin
beers
probably
the
worst
one
ive
had
i
guess
i
should
have
done
some
research
before
i
bought
it
if
this
truly
is
the
original
pumpkin
beer
im
glad
other
breweries
have
done
much
better
things
with
this
substyle
since
this
very
thin
body
with
a
poplike
carbonation
the
flavor
is
also
thin
there
is
a
watery
orange
flavor
no
sugar
no
lasting
aftertaste
generally
speaking
this
is
a
weak
beer
with
a
touch
of
pumpkin
flavor
o
maybe
i
have
been
spoiled
by
the
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
locally
but
my
suggestion
is
to
avoid
this
one
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
just
too
overwhelming
and
sweet
overall
i
just
wish
that
this
beer
tasted
more
like
it
smells
but
that
might
just
be
me
being
a
fan
of
spicy
beers
that
said
go
grab
one
and
see
for
yourself
i
was
recommended
this
brew
as
a
nice
counter
to
the
more
heavily
spiced
painted
ladies
i
have
to
say
the
recommendation
was
spot
on
this
pumpkin
brew
is
more
heavily
on
the
sweet
side
its
dominated
by
sugary
pumpkin
and
very
little
spice
im
not
pulling
many
more
characteristics
out
of
this
beer
as
all
i
taste
is
sweetness
there
is
a
moment
when
the
beer
slides
down
my
throat
where
i
get
a
hint
of
bitterness
but
it
lasts
a
microsecond
and
then
the
finish
is
again
all
sweet
its
certainly
a
different
take
on
pumpkin
but
not
one
i
can
say
i
favor
overall
the
guy
at
sydneys
recommended
this
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
honestly
it
isnt
that
far
off
the
dfh
punkin
a
nice
surprise
its
a
great
pumpkin
charlie
brown
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
at
whole
foods
for
about
10
because
i
had
not
previously
seen
any
beers
from
bbb
anywhere
in
ma
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
bright
orange
color
nice
sized
head
forms
with
an
aggressive
pour
but
that
fades
quickly
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
smell
had
a
distinct
aroma
of
vegetables
which
was
earthy
but
not
very
appealing
flavor
tasted
like
authentic
pumpkins
mostly
like
a
steamed
gourd
there
was
no
pumpkin
spice
flavors
at
all
it
just
tastes
like
squash
really
mouthfeel
was
adequate
with
a
smooth
but
thin
body
this
beer
might
have
been
novel
and
great
when
it
was
first
released
but
its
been
surpassed
in
flavor
a
long
time
ago
nice
to
try
but
really
not
very
flavorful
not
my
favorite
of
the
pumpkin
beers
this
one
pours
a
little
cloudy
with
a
nice
autumn
color
palate
smell
is
spice
heavy
maybe
cloves
and
nutmeg
i
dont
smell
the
pumpkin
itself
really
taste
is
again
strong
on
the
spice
front
with
a
balanced
malt
body
in
the
medium
range
good
in
the
fall
but
there
are
much
better
ones
out
there
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
thin
overall
to
be
honest
this
stuff
just
tastes
commercial
to
me
i
dont
know
if
its
really
considered
commercial
or
not
but
personally
i
think
it
has
all
of
the
telltale
signs
of
a
beer
that
has
been
produced
as
quickly
and
cheaply
as
possible
o
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
too
special
i
guess
but
not
too
bad
on
a
fall
day
o
overall
it
isnt
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
by
far
but
i
do
think
its
far
better
then
some
of
the
more
popular
pumpkin
ales
out
there
this
is
my
session
pumpkin
beer
of
choice
to
be
honest
overall
an
easy
drinking
mild
pumpkin
beer
its
very
subtle
in
flavour
i
prefer
a
bit
more
substance
for
the
style
d
started
well
but
ends
a
little
disappointingly
i
like
the
hints
of
pumpkin
but
that
ends
up
falling
short
by
the
finish
a
little
more
balance
between
feel
and
taste
would
help
buffalo
bills
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
doesnt
do
much
for
me
perhaps
its
even
a
tad
metallic
the
flavor
is
a
slap
in
the
face
of
cinnamon
followed
by
pumpkin
pie
spices
in
the
following
sips
pumpkin
spices
are
more
apparent
without
the
cinnamon
stealing
the
show
this
isnt
really
my
thing
but
not
bad
for
what
it
is
o
easy
drinker
one
that
i
could
definitely
have
multiples
of
overall
ill
buy
this
each
year
it
really
tastes
centered
and
down
to
earth
and
earthy
i
like
it
compared
to
the
generic
overspiced
brews
that
have
flooded
the
market
overall
i
had
last
years
and
i
remember
it
being
a
little
more
potent
and
having
more
flavor
to
it
i
will
try
next
years
and
see
how
that
is
cheers
the
aroma
has
potential
if
that
artificiality
wasnt
there
o
being
the
original
doesnt
mean
its
the
best
overall
i
dont
know
how
to
say
this
this
wasnt
much
of
a
beer
easy
drinking
but
nothing
to
savor
just
needs
to
be
more
bold
all
around
o
overall
the
beer
was
drinkable
but
not
crafted
very
well
if
the
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
were
a
little
more
natural
tasting
and
the
flavors
all
cooperated
with
each
other
this
would
be
a
good
pumpkin
beer
this
was
a
decent
first
pumpkin
beer
for
me
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
o
not
gonna
be
a
seasonal
favorite
of
mine
seemed
like
a
bit
of
a
mess
that
ultimately
lacked
flavor
and
character
drinkability
too
watered
down
for
my
liking
nice
aroma
but
not
much
else
overall
this
is
a
forgettable
pumpkin
ale
in
a
market
that
is
saturated
with
much
better
examples
both
sessionable
and
imperial
varieties
elysian
makes
the
best
sessionable
example
if
you
ask
me
and
weyerbacher
and
williamsburg
makes
great
imperial
versions
look
elsewhere
for
your
gourd
fix
this
season
pours
a
cloudy
copper
orange
color
with
a
light
fluffy
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
heavy
in
pumkin
nuttmeg
clove
spice
and
a
little
bananna
taste
is
smooth
and
clean
you
can
definetly
pick
out
the
pumpkin
taste
and
a
little
of
the
spice
but
thats
about
it
i
was
really
hoping
for
more
spice
flavor
that
basically
reminds
me
of
a
pumpkin
pie
something
seasonal
to
get
you
into
the
festive
fall
mood
but
thats
about
it
overall
a
pretty
average
pumpkin
ale
i
guess
you
could
call
it
a
session
beer
but
i
wouldnt
really
want
more
than
2
or
3
of
these
i
would
have
liked
a
fuller
taste
profile
with
more
pumpkin
flavor
making
things
worse
these
are
twist
offs
making
them
unusable
for
my
homebrew
so
i
knocked
off
a
few
points
for
that
theres
your
beer
karma
for
ya
buffalo
bill
o
the
beer
was
alright
i
like
pumpkin
beers
and
wanted
to
tryit
i
would
not
buy
a
case
of
it
tho
o
one
of
the
worst
pumpkin
beers
out
there
unless
you
love
spices
in
large
amounts
not
worth
seeking
out
my
tongue
and
back
of
my
throat
are
still
burning
ten
minutes
after
finishing
this
beer
glad
my
brother
paid
for
this
six
pack
o
not
nearly
as
awful
as
i
feared
but
not
good
poured
with
very
little
head
and
what
little
there
was
disappeared
quickly
copper
color
very
clear
smelled
of
soil
with
traces
of
spice
and
tea
leaves
tasted
slightly
malty
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
i
guess
a
little
pumpkin
somewhere
in
there
as
well
almost
tasted
more
like
chai
tea
then
pumpkin
ale
very
crisp
mouthfeel
lots
of
carbonation
finishes
smooth
and
clean
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
the
taste
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
again
with
all
of
the
other
more
flavorful
pumpkin
ales
available
these
days
pours
a
clear
copper
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
pumpkin
spice
all
spice
and
slight
grain
fits
the
style
of
a
pumpkin
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pumpkin
slight
sweet
malt
slight
grain
slight
pale
malt
and
spice
all
spice
overall
decent
aroma
and
blend
but
the
pumpkin
is
strong
and
easily
discernible
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
that
ive
had
to
date
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
just
a
little
light
in
the
flavor
m
mediumtothin
body
heavily
carbonated
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
watery
and
metallic
pours
out
a
dark
orange
with
a
thin
whitehead
that
quickly
disappears
leaving
no
lacing
or
retention
and
lots
of
bubbles
going
to
the
top
the
smell
is
by
far
the
best
of
any
pumpkin
ale
i
have
tasted
the
aroma
of
cinnamon
cloves
nutmeg
and
allspice
makes
you
look
forward
to
drinking
this
beer
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
pumpkin
and
hints
of
spices
but
not
much
there
in
the
taste
rather
disappointing
after
such
a
wonderful
aroma
from
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
watery
which
makes
for
easy
drinking
and
not
much
else
overall
this
is
just
an
average
beer
that
just
doesnt
do
much
for
me
two
of
my
roommates
who
arent
big
beer
drinkers
actually
loved
the
flavor
and
said
it
was
a
great
beer
though
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
pretty
bad
pumpkin
beer
this
beer
pours
a
ok
looking
cloudy
brown
the
smell
is
just
a
beer
smell
theres
no
spiciness
nothing
special
at
all
i
expect
some
sweetness
and
fall
spices
but
there
isnt
much
goin
on
here
at
all
the
taste
has
the
same
problem
there
just
isnt
enough
goin
on
this
is
an
average
beer
ane
a
below
average
pumpkin
ale
i
was
really
not
impressed
by
this
the
only
thing
pumpkin
about
this
is
the
one
on
the
label
o
really
a
bland
beer
but
it
is
something
that
i
might
pick
up
if
there
were
no
other
interesting
options
just
cracked
one
open
poured
into
the
trusty
old
double
handed
jax
mug
pours
a
decently
pretty
and
slightly
burnt
orange
color
rather
carbonated
no
lacing
or
head
retention
really
at
all
taste
wise
im
impressed
and
ill
tell
you
why
most
pumpkin
beers
are
simply
filled
with
pumpkin
spices
this
beer
you
can
actually
noticeably
taste
the
pumpkin
juice
itself
which
is
quite
refreshing
followed
by
a
well
balanced
after
taste
of
the
usual
spice
suspects
my
only
complaint
is
the
body
and
mouthfeel
on
this
one
leave
much
to
be
desired
though
the
taste
is
really
quite
good
all
in
all
a
great
session
beer
for
those
chilly
fall
nights
bout
to
go
have
another
out
on
the
porch
and
enjoy
this
new
found
fall
weather
cheers
ba
brethren
d
drinkability
is
quite
high
if
you
actually
like
this
beer
its
not
terrible
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
did
they
mess
up
the
recipe
for
this
batch
i
wonder
i
tried
3
from
this
case
so
far
and
wish
i
could
return
it
o
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
smell
the
spices
seem
to
be
a
bit
muted
but
the
flavor
does
come
around
in
the
palate
this
beer
was
poured
into
a
snifter
the
beer
has
an
orangish
hazing
hue
to
it
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
beer
has
a
slight
pumpkin
smell
to
it
and
almost
no
hints
of
cinnamon
or
allspice
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
thin
and
is
dominated
by
the
carbonation
way
to
overpowering
the
beer
has
a
large
malt
presence
with
a
burnt
taste
to
it
the
aftertaste
suggests
a
slight
amount
of
spices
and
pumpkins
overall
im
not
impressed
with
this
beer
but
its
not
horrible
overall
get
the
smells
on
the
nose
to
be
present
on
the
sip
and
get
a
creamier
mouth
feel
and
this
would
be
a
decent
pumpkin
brew
it
is
not
too
late
to
believe
that
this
thing
can
not
be
fixed
until
then
look
elsewhere
for
that
perfect
autumn
beer
this
pours
a
light
golden
color
i
poured
very
aggressive
and
got
a
very
short
lived
head
it
fizzed
away
faster
than
a
coke
and
left
me
with
absolutely
no
foam
the
smell
is
of
spices
and
cloves
with
a
little
pumpkin
feel
is
light
taste
has
some
pumpkin
and
spices
but
overall
its
pretty
light
and
not
very
impressive
i
doubt
i
ever
get
this
beer
again
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
very
interesting
either
also
not
one
of
the
tastier
of
the
pumpkin
flavored
beers
o
its
a
good
overall
effort
fairly
standard
as
far
as
mainstream
pumpkin
ales
go
its
not
bad
but
it
isnt
as
satisfying
as
id
like
my
pumpkinfallwinter
ales
to
be
cheers
pours
a
hazy
golden
brown
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
smells
like
your
usual
fare
for
pumpkin
ales
nutmeg
cinnamon
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
the
addition
of
pumpkin
and
allspice
overall
a
decent
fall
seasonal
that
doesnt
slam
you
with
too
much
pumpkin
pie
essence
overall
bbs
is
one
of
the
first
pumpkin
beers
i
had
years
and
years
ago
alongside
post
road
it
was
a
simpler
time
really
years
later
its
now
one
of
the
more
milder
easy
drinking
of
the
bunch
with
its
relatively
lighter
tastes
particularly
the
spices
and
the
effervescent
body
while
not
bad
it
seems
most
are
leaning
towards
the
bolder
in
the
growing
style
like
pumking
or
weyerbachers
version
i
cant
say
i
blame
them
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
1
inch
extremely
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
whatsoever
smell
is
of
some
malt
spices
and
maybe
a
vegetable
pumpkinesque
aroma
pretty
tame
overall
taste
is
of
spices
up
front
with
a
pumpkinlike
malt
flavor
on
the
finish
the
aftertaste
has
hints
of
pumpkin
pie
way
too
carbonated
however
with
a
sodalike
fizzy
feel
in
the
mouth
overall
not
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
at
all
it
may
be
americas
original
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
anything
worth
drinking
overall
this
is
a
decent
average
pumpkin
ale
and
you
have
to
give
them
points
for
being
the
originator
of
what
is
now
a
very
popular
historic
brew
style
that
goes
back
to
our
colonial
days
when
our
founding
fathers
brewed
with
pumpkins
to
give
jolly
king
george
some
crap
and
tell
him
where
he
could
shove
his
english
malts
worth
trying
oits
average
to
below
there
are
alot
of
pumpkin
beers
out
there
alot
i
am
sure
that
are
way
better
sorry
buffalo
bill
your
finishing
near
the
bottom
of
the
afc
pumpkin
beer
division
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
decent
flavor
going
on
but
the
mouthfeel
ruins
it
a
bit
that
and
the
fizziness
make
me
wonder
if
these
have
carbonation
issues
goes
down
pretty
easily
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
glass
doverall
this
brew
was
just
ok
wish
the
pumking
came
through
more
and
wish
it
was
alittle
more
complex
wont
try
this
one
again
but
it
was
decent
to
drink
once
i
would
like
to
try
the
imperial
pumpkin
from
them
just
to
see
the
difference
poured
into
imperial
pint
glass
poured
a
very
pale
straw
color
not
typical
for
this
style
thin
bubbly
head
that
didnt
last
long
small
streams
of
bubbles
rose
from
the
bottom
some
times
the
aroma
was
like
a
fake
pumpkin
pie
ice
cream
other
times
it
reminded
me
of
cheap
cafeteria
meatball
subs
very
strange
combo
flavor
was
remarkably
like
the
aroma
a
hint
of
pumpkin
flavors
but
overwhelmed
by
a
watery
ketchup
flavor
just
ok
in
the
mouth
a
bit
thin
and
the
carbonation
definitely
overpowered
it
overall
not
a
good
beer
flavor
was
meh
at
best
definitely
not
worth
what
i
paid
o
bland
disappointing
maybe
this
bottle
was
too
old
is
6
months
too
long
for
a
pumpkin
ale
to
retain
its
flavor
one
and
done
i
remember
having
this
a
long
time
ago
during
my
purdue
years
so
i
figured
id
revisit
it
whilst
filling
one
of
my
newest
mixed
sixers
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
orangeamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
plenty
o
particulates
float
about
suspended
in
midbeer
the
nose
comprises
cinnamon
vanilla
nutmeg
clove
brown
sugar
pumpkin
pie
filling
and
honey
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
candle
with
this
scent
the
taste
holds
notes
of
clove
light
black
pepper
pumpkin
seeds
flowers
and
some
light
greens
not
only
does
this
flavor
combination
not
really
follow
the
nose
at
all
its
decidedly
weaker
blander
and
mildly
bitterer
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
oily
feel
overall
a
meek
and
meager
pumpkin
beer
one
that
i
really
dont
feel
like
having
again
cheers
has
an
orangish
color
to
it
smells
of
pumpkin
obviously
and
spices
such
as
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
tastes
like
pumpkin
all
spiced
up
and
has
a
very
good
smooth
feeling
in
the
mouth
so
taste
and
mouthful
says
it
all
for
the
this
beer
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
good
beer
if
your
into
an
average
joe
brand
kind
of
beer
d
the
abv
is
low
in
this
which
makes
it
a
easy
drinker
the
flavor
is
muted
and
more
pumpkin
pie
forward
than
actual
pumpkin
tasting
a
average
pumpkin
beer
at
best
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
out
from
fall
brew
tasting
notes
2010
pours
a
light
yelloworange
color
with
a
weird
head
that
fizzles
away
rapidly
like
soda
leaving
not
so
much
as
a
single
bubble
on
top
aroma
is
extremely
strong
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
cloves
come
in
at
the
end
no
beer
aroma
just
spices
taste
is
offputtingly
spicy
no
pumpkin
character
here
until
late
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
definitely
gets
better
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
extremely
overspiced
this
one
is
really
rough
on
the
palate
d
i
might
have
never
given
this
beer
a
second
chance
had
it
not
been
for
a
sixpack
brought
to
a
family
gathering
by
my
cousin
i
first
tasted
this
beer
ondraft
at
the
brewpub
in
hayward
around
1999
and
i
found
it
to
be
overpowering
in
the
intensity
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
at
that
time
for
years
after
i
would
turn
my
nose
up
at
these
bottles
whenever
id
see
them
presently
it
seems
that
this
beer
is
able
to
hold
its
own
with
other
common
pumpkin
ales
never
mind
that
years
of
experience
have
taught
me
to
lower
my
expectations
when
it
comes
to
this
style
d
it
was
a
malty
pumpkin
beer
that
wsa
one
of
the
bottom
3
i
have
had
there
will
not
be
another
purchase
but
it
will
do
in
a
bind
before
i
sampled
this
beer
i
expected
something
heavier
in
body
its
supposed
to
taste
like
a
pumpkin
pie
right
but
my
biggest
issue
was
that
i
just
couldnt
taste
the
pumpkin
when
combined
with
the
high
carbonation
id
pass
if
i
had
the
chance
to
drink
this
again
i
dont
care
for
this
ale
really
at
all
money
well
spent
d
honestly
even
with
the
low
taste
score
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
the
aftertase
is
ok
and
the
carbonation
makes
it
feel
almost
like
soda
which
is
always
easy
to
drink
d
easy
to
drink
some
of
that
may
be
due
to
the
lack
of
flavor
easy
to
chug
overall
what
we
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
spicy
and
full
aroma
the
taste
however
predominantly
lacked
much
of
the
nose
and
failed
to
make
up
for
it
in
any
other
aspect
of
its
being
overall
some
subtle
strengths
some
significant
weaknesses
definitely
at
the
bottom
of
the
pumpkin
ale
pile
in
my
experience
d
very
middleoftheroad
pumpkin
ale
im
afraid
it
doesnt
really
do
anything
for
me
and
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
from
any
of
the
other
pumpkin
ales
out
there
o
i
like
pumpkin
ales
so
this
is
preferred
to
many
beers
but
this
is
most
certainly
not
my
favorite
of
the
pumpkin
beers
all
in
all
though
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
certainly
not
a
disaster
the
packaging
is
attractive
it
looks
good
on
a
table
for
an
autumn
feast
and
most
of
your
less
beer
savvy
friends
will
like
it
but
there
are
much
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
this
is
nothing
special
d
the
beer
is
drinkable
and
goes
down
easily
but
theres
nothing
interesting
in
the
smell
or
taste
that
would
make
me
want
to
try
this
one
again
all
in
all
nope
dont
worry
about
this
brew
i
love
pumpkin
beers
so
i
gave
this
one
a
try
at
first
i
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
it
but
the
more
i
drank
the
more
my
taste
buds
enjoyed
it
this
seems
to
have
an
overwhelming
citrus
flavor
if
poured
into
a
glass
but
from
the
bottle
its
seems
more
like
a
pumpkin
and
clove
tasting
beer
sometimes
beers
seem
to
unlock
more
flavor
when
you
pour
them
into
a
glass
seems
more
intense
in
flavor
but
dont
let
that
stop
you
from
trying
it
you
may
miss
out
on
something
you
wouldve
loved
d
for
as
few
positive
marks
as
this
gets
i
still
find
it
drinkable
and
an
apt
harbinger
of
autumn
maybe
theres
some
sentimentality
here
as
i
recall
friends
bring
over
and
ultimately
leaving
behind
a
6pack
years
ago
when
we
moved
into
our
house
i
ve
always
tried
to
pick
up
at
least
a
few
bottles
every
fall
despite
a
few
better
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
though
sadly
not
enough
for
my
liking
worth
a
try
but
then
if
you
like
the
style
enough
look
elsewhere
nice
cinnamon
aftertaste
i
dont
really
like
to
eat
pumpkin
pie
or
pumpkin
inspired
food
so
i
was
eary
about
buying
this
pleasantly
surprised
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
drinkability
much
too
filling
i
feel
like
i
ate
an
entire
pumpkin
pie
one
and
i
will
never
drink
another
again
dm
very
crisp
and
light
on
the
tongue
the
carbonation
was
good
but
really
dissipated
quickly
i
wanted
a
little
more
spice
and
punch
from
the
flavors
this
was
a
good
subtle
beer
to
enjoy
d
kind
of
flavorful
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
the
sweetness
and
lack
of
hops
doesnt
bother
me
with
this
beer
because
its
a
pumpkin
ale
i
think
the
only
thing
that
separates
this
beer
from
others
in
the
style
is
the
much
lighter
malt
character
however
for
this
style
that
is
a
very
significant
and
detrimental
difference
pours
a
copper
brown
color
with
a
very
thin
off
white
head
the
nose
brings
a
ridiculously
overloaded
amount
of
spice
taste
brings
ever
so
slight
hints
of
caramel
and
sweetness
sitting
behind
ginormous
amounts
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
allspice
clove
and
probably
every
other
spice
man
has
ever
found
way
too
spicy
and
a
bit
thin
overall
poor
drinkability
the
epitome
of
what
not
to
do
with
a
spiced
beer
d
i
wouldnt
go
seek
this
beer
out
but
i
could
drink
it
again
i
think
there
are
better
pumkin
ales
out
there
over
all
im
still
on
the
fence
with
this
beer
pours
a
bright
orange
colour
with
almost
no
head
and
zero
lacing
smells
like
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
but
fairly
faint
no
noticeable
smell
of
beer
really
flavour
is
a
bit
sweet
and
spicy
but
not
the
rich
pumpkin
pie
flavour
im
used
to
from
pumpkin
beers
way
undercarbonated
but
not
quite
flat
ok
beer
but
not
one
i
plan
to
pick
up
again
very
slight
notes
of
pumpkin
pie
and
nutmeg
are
evident
in
this
beer
but
overall
it
is
a
bland
product
with
little
standout
points
this
is
a
fun
novelty
beer
for
the
fall
with
friends
but
not
something
that
woudl
become
a
staple
of
anyones
beer
fridge
not
a
fan
but
my
wife
liked
it
this
is
very
watery
for
a
pumpkin
aleit
poured
orange
with
a
lot
of
fizzy
carbonation
and
no
head
to
speak
of
it
smells
very
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
yeast
and
allspice
and
tastes
the
samevery
clovey
very
sweet
very
simple
malt
profile
not
much
going
on
outside
of
the
sweetness
a
thoroughly
average
beer
d
i
cant
imagine
drinking
many
of
these
in
a
row
id
buy
it
again
but
it
is
not
something
that
i
would
use
as
a
session
beer
the
yeast
kind
of
ruined
this
for
me
it
tastes
more
like
a
hefe
than
pumpkin
ale
i
dont
know
if
i
had
a
bad
bottle
or
if
they
just
didnt
label
it
as
bottle
conditioned
di
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
its
not
anything
worth
seeking
out
atmosphere
is
okay
the
appearance
is
really
pedestrian
nose
is
a
pretty
aromatic
combination
of
grain
and
sweet
spice
components
flavor
is
very
disjointed
and
just
not
all
that
appealing
overall
this
is
not
the
greatest
quaff
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
no
retention
or
laceing
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
and
spices
body
is
thin
and
fizzy
taste
is
mostly
pumpkinwith
a
bit
of
creamy
spice
very
weak
version
of
this
style
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
this
one
sunset
sky
in
color
with
light
bubbly
white
head
on
top
sweet
aroma
of
pumpkin
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
slight
brown
sugar
and
oddly
sea
salt
offensive
flavors
of
nutmeg
salted
veggies
hops
citrus
and
lemon
zest
spritzy
character
similar
to
club
soda
and
light
in
body
a
pumpkin
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
pumpkin
someone
broke
in
and
tweaked
the
recipe
or
switched
the
bottling
lines
pours
from
the
bottle
a
light
orange
color
with
an
extremely
minimal
white
head
which
quickly
recedes
at
first
this
one
smells
somewhat
like
pumpkin
pie
but
the
initial
aromas
fade
rather
quickly
leaving
something
akin
to
an
average
amber
ale
on
the
palate
this
one
is
fairly
thin
with
a
little
cinnamon
cardamon
and
clove
decent
at
best
its
a
nice
copper
color
producing
a
decent
amount
of
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
the
aroma
was
some
light
malts
and
a
bit
of
that
ohsofamous
orange
gourd
the
taste
was
of
pumpkin
but
it
didnt
have
that
vegetable
tinge
to
it
so
it
was
a
bit
sweeter
than
an
actual
pumpkin
would
be
with
the
sweeter
taste
it
went
down
fairly
easy
and
made
for
a
good
study
beverage
i
could
go
for
this
one
again
firm
aroma
is
malty
with
an
overtone
of
cinnamon
and
a
strong
hint
of
pumpkin
it
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
minimal
head
or
lacing
malty
flavor
has
a
pumpkiny
undertone
and
a
hint
of
spice
mainly
cinnamon
at
least
this
pumpkin
ale
tastes
more
of
ale
than
pumpkin
fizziness
is
minimal
but
this
may
be
because
this
bottle
was
in
the
car
for
a
couple
days
during
hot
atlanta
weather
drinkable
and
for
a
pumpkin
beer
this
will
do
in
a
pinch
but
theres
better
options
out
there
d
americas
original
pumpkin
ale
or
not
this
beer
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
an
ok
pickup
but
near
the
bottom
of
the
pumpkin
beer
pack
taste
lots
of
pumpkin
cinammon
prolly
some
other
thanksgiving
type
of
spice
nutmeg
s
too
very
season
in
its
feel
big
carbonation
throughout
no
hops
no
bitterness
this
is
an
octoberfestish
style
of
beer
i
can
tolerate
i
like
the
pumpkin
a
little
pricey
though
i
mean
no
hops
no
malt
pumpkins
are
dirt
cheap
why
is
this
810
bucks
a
sixpack
because
of
that
and
the
fact
that
its
the
kind
of
beer
i
dont
want
more
than
12
oz
of
in
a
day
i
docked
some
drinkability
off
of
it
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
although
it
isnt
a
horrible
beer
just
not
a
good
pumpkin
beer
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
session
pumpkin
ales
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
good
d
pretty
drinkable
i
thought
it
could
use
a
better
mouthfeel
but
this
was
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
not
too
good
i
was
hoping
it
was
going
to
be
up
there
with
the
quality
of
their
orange
blossom
but
no
go
i
dont
particularly
enjoy
pumpkin
but
ive
had
many
other
pumpkins
that
are
very
drinkable

it
is
very
drinkable
just
not
that
enjoyable
so
it
has
to
loose
a
little
there
i
have
to
wonder
how
different
the
bottle
version
is
from
the
actual
source
it
has
the
bells
and
whistles
for
the
style
but
the
beer
component
struggles
a
bit
from
the
2010
series
sampled
on
september
8
2010
the
pour
is
a
somewhat
murky
orangecopper
with
a
shortlived
twoinch
head
that
dissolves
to
nothing
in
the
aroma
i
get
a
more
malty
yeasty
character
with
only
a
hint
of
spice
and
only
a
modest
pumpkin
scent
the
taste
tends
to
be
a
little
sweeter
than
many
with
a
subtle
pumpkin
taste
and
a
fairly
decent
maltiness
not
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
this
season
but
somewhat
easy
and
quick
to
drink
drinkability
not
too
good
mild
flavors
with
an
overwhelming
amount
of
carbonation
d
not
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
thought
the
smell
was
lacking
spices
and
pumpkin
and
the
taste
had
very
little
would
not
want
to
have
again
drinkability
very
good
you
can
really
taste
the
pumpkin
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
definitely
very
good
d
drinks
easily
enough
but
nothing
special
here
not
near
as
good
as
dfh
punkin
or
st
pumking
but
you
get
the
feel
of
a
fall
brew
without
being
over
the
top
cheers
to
a
great
autumn
dnot
something
i
will
pick
up
again
i
plan
to
drink
them
all
six
pack
but
its
going
to
take
a
while
it
might
be
good
with
a
turkey
dinner
or
used
to
cook
with
hell
theres
enough
spices
present
why
not
fairly
drinkable
a
little
too
watery
for
it
style
maybe
not
the
best
beer
i
ever
had
but
not
the
worst
d
i
really
appreciate
a
pumpkin
ale
with
real
pumpkin
flavor
but
this
one
just
didnt
have
anything
else
going
on
couldnt
finish
this
one
overall
this
one
is
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
for
the
pumpkin
brews
some
brewers
under
do
it
and
others
put
pumpkin
pie
in
a
blender
this
is
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
if
you
like
a
big
sweet
spicy
one
this
will
seem
underdone
but
more
drinkable
if
you
are
not
fond
of
spiced
beer
this
will
seem
a
bit
sweet
and
too
well
seasoned
i
think
it
is
somewhere
in
the
middle
didnt
hate
it
but
found
it
harder
to
drink
as
i
continued
thru
to
the
end
one
was
enough
all
in
all
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
seeing
the
label
as
pumpkin
ale
i
couldnt
help
but
feel
almost
conned
after
tasting
it
i
did
enjoy
the
aroma
and
flavours
but
to
me
its
just
an
almost
above
average
beer
thanks
again
to
market
of
choice
for
stocking
this
beer
the
only
thing
that
really
impressed
me
about
this
beer
is
the
aroma
of
pumpkin
some
people
dont
like
pumpkin
beers
but
i
try
to
not
be
so
objective
since
they
are
around
only
a
small
part
of
the
year
normally
there
was
some
light
carbonation
bubbles
painting
to
top
of
the
glass
but
no
lacing
whatsoever
i
tried
one
of
these
and
thats
about
all
i
wanted
im
looking
forward
to
trying
some
other
pumpkin
beers
later
this
year
d
maybe
one
go
ahead
and
taste
one
if
you
want
but
there
are
many
better
choices
in
this
category
by
far
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
actually
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
and
not
beer
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
like
some
other
pumpkin
beer
ofallons
is
a
distant
second
have
tried
southern
tier
pumking
shipyards
lakefront
pumpkin
lager
post
road
blue
moon
jacks
pumpkin
spice
and
imo
its
the
best
d
not
awful
but
not
very
beer
like
maybe
okay
to
drink
one
or
two
around
the
holidays
but
there
are
far
better
pumpkin
beers
and
winter
warmers
available
i
would
not
buy
this
again
even
if
it
was
on
sale
served
in
oct
2009
beer
is
thin
and
has
almost
no
bitterness
at
all
spices
up
front
carbonation
in
the
mouth
is
fine
drinkability
is
moderate
not
really
my
favorite
even
pumpkin
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
it
again
tastes
like
a
first
attempt
at
home
brew
slightly
sour
yeast
flavor
cloudy
amber
appearance
smells
neutral
to
sour
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
even
michelobs
pumpkin
beer
is
better
do
not
do
not
buy
this
at
any
price
just
isnt
worth
the
tourble
notes
the
fake
sweet
flavor
is
a
nogo
and
really
ruins
it
pretty
bad
actually
and
only
appropriate
when
organizing
a
fallpumpkin
beer
tasting
as
i
was
shows
a
light
orange
in
the
glass
with
a
white
froth
average
head
retention
and
decent
lacing
somewhat
pronounced
aromas
of
artificial
pumpkin
flavoring
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
brown
sugar
sweet
but
definitely
artificial
flavors
of
grains
light
pumpkin
flavoring
cinnamon
nutmeg
easy
brown
sugar
wow
let
me
go
in
for
another
drink
yep
that
tastes
pretty
putrid
its
barley
drinkable
so
i
cant
give
it
the
lowest
score
possible
but
its
pretty
bad
overall
avoid
this
at
all
costs
drinkability
is
possible
its
just
not
my
thing
the
brew
is
a
hint
of
the
style
but
mainly
due
to
spice
assocation
and
not
actual
pumkin
mediocre
at
best
for
light
brew
version
of
the
pumpkin
style
they
call
themselves
americas
original
pumpkin
ale
but
is
it
really
since
pumpkin
ale
has
been
brewed
in
america
since
the
pilgrims
the
spices
are
very
strong
here
and
could
easily
get
in
the
way
of
enjoying
this
beer
i
like
the
style
though
not
horrible
but
not
really
good
either
ill
stick
to
the
tazmanian
ale
on
future
visits
to
buffallo
bills
that
one
is
at
least
tasty
and
pairs
with
the
food
well
drinkability
it
is
very
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
cheers
d
easy
to
drink
sure
enought
but
just
not
very
special
at
all
d
i
would
say
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
at
the
least
would
be
a
perfect
introduction
beer
beyond
bmc
beers
not
very
exciting
though
if
you
are
not
a
beginner
drinkability
theres
definitly
better
pumkin
ales
out
there
worst
of
the
batch
i
have
ever
had
d
well
whatever
there
are
enough
pumpkin
beers
out
there
this
one
is
worth
a
shot
it
is
unique
enough
i
used
to
really
look
forward
to
buying
this
beer
every
septoct
but
i
can
honestly
say
that
this
is
the
last
year
ill
be
stocking
up
on
it
makes
me
wonder
how
bad
the
other
pumpkin
beers
must
have
been
for
this
buffalo
bills
brew
to
have
been
my
pick
of
the
litter
as
previously
mentioned
in
regards
to
pumpkin
beers
dogfish
heads
punkin
will
fill
my
fridge
for
the
foreseeable
future
not
a
great
beer
pretty
drinkable
with
biscuity
flavors
but
the
tough
nose
is
a
lot
to
get
past
d
how
this
pumpkin
soda
passes
for
a
beer
is
beyond
me
avid
this
beer
at
all
costs
dont
even
give
it
a
try
drain
poured
after
3
sips
ugh
this
lacks
the
malt
complexity
i
have
come
to
expect
in
a
craft
made
pumpkin
ale
overall
a
decent
drinking
beer
but
not
as
nice
as
most
craft
brews
this
may
be
the
original
but
it
was
not
perfect
from
the
get
go
despite
the
apparent
bottle
conditioning
this
has
a
heavy
handed
level
of
carbonation
that
is
too
much
for
the
light
body
this
has
a
few
flaws
but
pretty
easy
to
drink
without
thinking
about
it
much
this
is
a
fair
choice
if
youre
looking
to
do
a
session
of
pumpkin
ales
d
not
your
best
pumpkin
ale
out
there
but
by
no
means
the
worst
having
tried
it
for
the
past
few
years
it
definitely
fluctuates
with
quality
but
if
you
happen
to
stumble
upon
one
of
their
better
batches
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
d
pass
im
having
trouble
even
finishing
this
one
smells
like
its
going
to
be
good
i
can
taste
pumpkin
hazlenut
cinnamon
as
promised
but
seems
more
like
a
light
beer
not
much
beer
flavor
to
it
its
like
drinking
miller
light
out
of
a
pumpkin
id
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
buy
it
again
might
be
good
to
suggest
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
beer
my
girlfriend
doesnt
like
beer
and
she
liked
it
because
it
tastes
like
pumpkin
and
not
much
like
beer
i
dont
know
maybe
this
was
meant
to
be
drank
out
of
the
bottle
for
some
reason
smelled
better
out
of
the
bottle
than
the
glass
and
it
would
actually
be
a
good
thing
to
lighten
the
flavor
of
this
mess
of
a
beer
beer
pours
an
orangeish
copper
colour
with
very
little
head
that
dissipates
almost
as
quickly
as
it
forms
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
nutmeg
galore
taste
is
finally
something
i
can
write
home
about
unlike
many
pumpkin
beers
that
deliver
on
smell
but
not
on
taste
this
one
is
delicious
pumpkin
flavours
really
come
through
on
this
one
and
leaves
a
wonderfully
sweet
aftertaste
feels
a
little
light
watery
is
probably
too
strong
a
word
but
does
not
keep
me
too
intrigued
very
high
carbonation
is
also
a
little
bothersome
beer
is
very
drinkable
however
the
sweet
taste
leaves
you
wanting
more
and
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
all
in
all
this
is
easily
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
yet
the
poor
reviews
mostly
seemed
to
centre
around
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
which
is
exactly
what
kept
me
intrigued
too
many
pumpkin
ales
taste
simply
like
ales
that
smelled
like
pumpkins
but
never
delivered
on
the
taste
this
one
gives
you
a
sweet
little
treat
perfect
for
the
thanksgiving
season
watery
thin
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
its
easy
to
drink
and
kind
of
refreshing
but
it
seriously
lacks
any
complexity
d
its
certainly
an
easy
drinking
pumpkin
ale
much
better
than
i
had
expected
but
although
they
got
the
pumpkin
and
spice
proportions
right
the
beer
malt
and
hops
isnt
really
there
way
too
thin
notes
bbcsd0909patrickm
overall
i
dont
get
the
low
scores
for
this
beer
was
it
the
be
all
end
all
of
pumpkins
no
but
it
was
solid
and
enjoyable
it
needed
a
bit
more
body
and
complexity
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
drinker
d
very
drinkable
not
overly
spiced
or
pumpkiny
for
that
matter
but
still
flavorful
and
enjoyable
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
d
with
all
the
mixed
reviews
here
i
gotta
say
this
is
in
no
means
a
good
beer
but
its
far
from
horrible
lets
face
it
there
are
a
lot
of
fishes
in
the
sea
when
it
comes
to
us
pumpkin
beers
with
a
lot
of
dead
fish
as
well
if
this
did
not
have
such
a
dead
look
and
feel
this
could
be
a
good
contender
for
a
sixer
per
season
for
now
ill
stick
to
my
single
this
beer
goes
down
pretty
easy
if
you
are
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
not
overly
sweet
or
bitter
with
a
manageable
abv
i
didnt
think
this
was
terrible
but
it
wasnt
that
good
either
drinkability
is
governed
by
how
much
of
this
thin
stuff
you
can
stomach
for
me
one
bottle
was
quite
enough
definitely
will
not
be
revisiting
this
particular
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
goes
down
easy
its
not
too
complex
not
too
sweet
or
bitter
and
not
too
heavy
yeah
it
would
be
about
as
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
as
it
would
be
to
have
a
lot
of
cokes
from
what
ive
experienced
of
pumpkin
beers
its
something
of
an
accomplishment
to
be
able
to
stomach
even
one
which
is
my
justification
of
the
justaboveaverage
score
on
drinkability
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
awful
beer
its
interesting
but
not
in
a
way
most
enthusiasts
would
find
enjoyable
a
huge
dissapointment
for
me
d
it
is
somewhat
drinkable
if
you
like
watery
sodalike
beers
this
is
very
similar
to
shipyard
pumpkinhead
like
a
generic
overcarbonated
tasteless
beer
with
spices
added
and
a
picture
of
a
pumpkin
on
the
label
really
cheap
1
49
but
still
not
even
worth
the
money
overall
i
think
this
beer
was
better
than
the
other
reviewers
would
have
you
believe
i
have
brewed
beers
with
odd
ingredients
what
homebrewer
hasnt
added
coffee
or
some
honey
to
an
otherwise
boring
recipe
and
i
know
how
hard
it
is
to
get
the
formula
righttreading
the
narrow
path
between
what
the
palate
expects
and
what
the
mind
knows
is
possible
i
think
they
get
it
just
about
right
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
certainly
better
than
some
that
take
the
safe
path
ill
drink
this
again
waiting
for
halloween
dont
be
afraid
to
try
it
poured
into
my
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
yellow
orange
i
achieved
a
rather
large
amount
of
head
with
an
agressive
pour
the
off
white
head
faded
almost
instantly
leaving
no
lace
behind
the
aroma
is
rather
promising
pumpkin
spice
is
there
all
the
usual
suspects
cinnimonclovenutmeg
it
has
an
apple
cider
feel
about
it
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
bitter
pumpkin
with
a
boat
load
of
cinnimon
and
pepper
this
is
like
a
heffe
experiment
gone
terribly
wrong
im
dreading
takin
the
next
couple
drinks
i
heard
this
was
bad
but
i
just
figured
it
was
hyperbole
the
body
is
light
and
this
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
not
good
i
can
file
this
under
never
again
in
my
book
d
sugary
but
oddly
dry
the
spice
is
relatively
mild
but
pretty
bland
and
it
contributes
a
bit
of
astringency
a
pretty
lackluster
beer
i
definitely
didnt
need
more
than
one
drinkability
not
a
very
impressive
beer
while
it
has
some
decent
pumpkin
flavor
there
is
no
accompanying
spice
to
compliment
it
just
an
incomplete
beer
i
wont
be
reaching
for
this
one
again
d
an
ok
pumpkin
ale
looks
like
hell
smells
fantastic
average
in
all
other
respects
does
go
down
nicely
however
and
would
pair
great
with
some
thanksgiving
leftovers
notes
a
bit
mediocre
and
somewhat
forgettable
it
is
not
a
horrible
drinking
experience
but
lacks
much
of
anything
to
making
it
a
mildly
interesting
pumpkin
ale
poured
a
golden
amber
leaving
a
frothy
head
that
quickly
that
quickly
went
away
nose
of
cloves
and
nutmeg
exactly
what
a
pumpkin
beer
should
have
a
good
tasting
seasonal
brew
the
flavours
are
more
pronounced
when
the
brew
becomes
room
temp
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
brews
of
this
season
mouth
feel
is
very
pricklysharp
on
the
carbonation
too
carbonated
for
me
it
is
a
very
lightbodied
ale
overall
not
my
favorite
i
just
wasnt
impressed
by
this
beer
i
picked
it
up
in
a
mixed
six
pack
and
im
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
full
sixer
this
just
isnt
my
thing
the
mouth
is
thin
and
lacking
carbination
weak
the
flavor
is
weak
as
well
some
mild
pumpkin
and
muted
spiciness
are
there
but
very
mildly
this
was
a
disappointment
look
for
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
no
head
but
there
is
a
bit
of
carbonation
present
when
drinking
overall
a
very
unique
brew
and
it
isnt
bad
just
dont
know
if
i
would
make
it
a
regular
buy
every
fall
ive
been
trying
every
pumpkin
beer
i
can
get
my
hands
on
this
year
and
this
one
is
in
the
upper
middle
of
the
pack
i
did
not
taste
any
pumpkin
flavors
at
all
in
this
beer
by
the
end
of
the
glass
the
copious
amounts
of
nutmeg
were
starting
to
dry
out
and
irritate
my
throat
d
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
you
could
drink
a
few
at
5
2
abv
i
will
finish
the
6pack
because
the
beer
isnt
horrible
just
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
drinkability
meh
i
will
not
pick
this
offering
up
again
but
im
glad
to
know
that
so
far
in
the
taste
test
dogfish
head
is
leading
the
pack
and
that
was
a
great
offering
but
this
one
falls
short
of
decent
you
might
as
well
just
buy
a
bud
nothing
to
get
excited
about
here
move
along
now
pours
a
nice
pumpkin
orange
color
with
some
decent
initial
head
no
lacing
nice
deep
pumpkin
scent
hints
of
the
gourd
itself
with
a
nice
pumpkin
spice
scent
nice
flavor
light
malt
sweetness
with
a
hit
of
pumpkin
spice
up
front
and
a
bit
of
the
pumpkin
itself
at
the
end
goes
down
quite
well
with
a
nice
sparkling
bit
of
carbonation
a
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
drinking
this
one
right
now
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
think
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
also
full
of
sediment
smells
like
pumpkins
tastes
like
pumpkin
as
well
a
bit
overcarbonated
gonna
take
a
while
to
finish
this
unless
i
decide
to
just
chug
it
to
get
it
over
with
as
quickly
as
possible
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
dimpled
mug
the
beer
greets
the
eye
a
murky
orange
color
with
not
even
a
finger
of
fizzy
off
white
head
that
disappears
within
seconds
nose
and
flavor
are
of
muted
spices
mainly
nutmeg
faint
hint
of
roasted
pumpkin
meat
a
trace
of
caramel
wheres
the
malt
light
bodied
and
slightly
under
carbonated
not
worth
your
time
im
not
too
experienced
with
pumpkin
ales
and
just
saw
this
one
on
the
shelf
first
and
decided
to
try
it
im
sure
many
superior
pumpkin
ales
can
be
found
pours
a
somewhat
opaque
amber
brown
body
small
whitish
head
quickly
diminishing
spicy
aroma
some
pumpkin
some
malty
fruitiness
graininess
spice
like
nutmeg
spicy
taste
fruity
sweet
spice
like
nutmeg
maybe
pumpkin
mmm
a
nice
fall
taste
light
body
watery
mouthfeel
with
some
astringency
and
a
bitterness
of
spice
left
on
the
tongue
alcohol
is
not
noticable
in
any
aspect
of
this
ale
not
an
easy
beer
to
like
i
really
dont
feel
like
finishing
this
one
drain
pour
this
starts
out
fairly
refreshing
but
about
halfway
through
it
just
gets
old
the
bros
review
is
severely
outdated
by
now
so
i
dont
think
avoid
is
an
appropiate
thing
to
say
but
i
would
find
maybe
one
bottle
if
i
really
wanted
to
try
this
and
that
would
be
the
end
probably
for
good
on
the
other
hand
this
is
probably
the
most
available
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
seen
in
louisiana
so
if
i
ever
had
to
have
one
i
guess
buffalo
bills
might
be
as
good
as
it
will
get
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
hazy
bright
orange
color
with
a
towering
overzealous
head
the
retention
of
this
massive
four
fingers
of
foam
was
only
moderate
however
and
the
lacing
weak
the
aroma
was
of
citrus
hops
nutmeg
and
musty
damp
malt
the
flavors
were
odd
starting
with
pale
malt
followed
by
nutmeg
and
a
slight
sourness
the
pumpkin
only
showed
up
for
the
finish
and
was
underwhelming
the
body
was
mediumlight
the
mouthfeel
average
and
the
carbonation
good
slightly
too
acidic
for
the
style
drinkability
id
like
to
see
less
emphasis
on
spices
and
more
on
a
heavier
mouthfeel
the
body
is
definitely
lacking
i
think
i
was
pretty
generous
with
my
ratings
as
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
in
the
near
future
notes
from
1205
easily
drinkable
but
lacks
much
flavor
i
would
probably
pass
on
this
beer
unless
somebody
gives
it
to
me
tastes
like
cloves
its
never
been
a
huge
ambition
of
mine
to
drink
liquid
cloves
mouthfeel
is
sharp
and
tacky
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
that
tastes
like
cloves
this
is
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
thats
even
slightly
good
look
elsewhere
d
easy
to
finish
a
sixer
and
its
a
nice
thanksgiving
beer
with
company
wouldnt
buy
again
future
outlook
hmmmm
no
thank
you
d
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
enjoyable
not
awesome
but
not
bad
wouldnt
mind
having
one
at
thanksgiving
dinner
pours
the
color
of
changing
autumn
leavesorange
with
golden
edges
hard
to
stir
up
any
head
and
a
lack
of
lace
leaves
this
less
than
impressive
the
nose
smells
like
cinnamon
and
dried
flowers
i
really
hope
this
doesnt
taste
the
way
it
smells
and
it
doesdammit
i
cant
help
but
think
of
potpourri
the
entire
time
that
im
drinking
this
it
isnt
as
offensive
as
it
soundsbut
it
still
isnt
good
either
the
body
is
thin
and
overly
carbonateda
touch
of
dryness
on
the
tail
is
acceptable
this
one
wont
be
revisited
anytime
soon
this
is
one
to
avoid
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
so
i
guess
im
a
little
disappointed
compared
to
other
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
this
one
really
doesnt
stack
up
too
well
its
not
awful
but
i
would
definately
turn
it
down
if
i
had
my
choice
of
other
similarlystyled
beers
as
with
anything
i
dont
like
im
not
going
to
let
this
impression
spoil
any
future
encounters
with
beers
from
this
brewery
taste
pumpkin
pie
flavor
but
its
more
subdued
than
some
other
pumpkin
ales
it
still
tastes
like
a
beer
where
as
other
similar
beers
are
like
liquid
pumpkin
pie
heres
one
that
i
will
drink
again
when
i
have
the
opportunity
mid
body
with
not
much
carbonation
i
probably
would
not
buy
this
beer
given
a
choice
they
do
a
good
job
on
flavor
for
the
style
though
note
ill
try
again
just
in
case
i
got
an
old
case
ill
update
the
review
if
i
notice
a
difference
d
low
abv
but
the
spices
are
too
much
to
make
it
very
drinkable
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
guess
thanks
anyway
corey
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
not
a
very
pleasant
beer
there
are
many
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
had
a
bottle
on
halloween
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
a
short
head
the
beer
starts
out
with
a
big
pumpkin
pie
flavor
heavy
on
the
spice
with
a
slight
sourdough
tang
in
the
background
the
body
is
lightmedium
but
the
balance
between
the
spices
and
malt
are
off
leaving
an
small
unpleasant
tang
in
the
aftertaste
not
bad
but
there
are
better
pumpkin
options
d
didnt
even
finish
it
not
worth
the
abv
not
good
least
favorite
pumpkin
beer
of
the
season
dont
bother
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
orange
color
with
2
fingers
of
fiizzy
cream
colored
head
ok
retention
and
minimal
lacing
smells
of
cinnamon
allspice
nutmeg
brown
sugar
bread
and
a
touch
of
pumpkin
tastes
of
cinnamon
allspice
nutmeg
clove
and
other
spices
up
front
then
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
and
light
caramel
mixed
with
grainy
malts
finish
is
a
bit
souring
and
citrusy
light
in
body
with
strong
carbonation
a
good
amount
of
spices
but
lacking
a
solid
malt
backing
but
a
nice
tart
finish
a
satisfactory
pumpkin
ale
at
least
worth
picking
up
one
bottle
every
season
verdict
i
find
this
beer
bland
and
that
it
really
fails
to
deliver
on
its
biggest
promise
pumpkin
but
i
can
certainly
see
its
appeal
to
the
masses
and
therefore
why
its
become
so
popular
pumpkin
ale
is
an
appealing
premise
for
the
fall
months
and
this
beer
being
on
the
thinner
and
sweeter
side
is
not
too
much
of
a
deviation
from
the
regular
macro
fare
for
the
more
traveled
drinker
however
much
more
complicated
and
satisfying
pumpkin
ales
can
easily
be
found
d
good
beer
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
i
really
did
not
find
this
beer
to
be
very
pleasurable
to
drink
the
flavor
while
fine
if
eating
a
desert
is
not
really
something
i
look
for
in
a
beer
it
was
overly
sweet
and
really
not
much
of
any
beer
taste
seriously
it
was
almost
like
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
smoothie
waaaay
too
much
cloves
taste
in
this
beer
every
fall
i
look
forward
to
drinking
a
few
new
pumpkin
ales
but
this
stuff
just
sucks
i
finished
the
bottle
30
minutes
ago
and
i
can
still
taste
the
cloves
a
hint
of
spices
my
bigfathairybeerdrinkin
ass
hey
its
easy
to
drink
because
there
aint
much
to
it
last
one
for
me
ill
stick
with
my
thick
st
louis
pumpkin
ales
schlafly
and
ofallon
please
drinkable
but
overall
a
huge
disappointment
from
the
original
pumpkin
ale
lacking
in
the
proper
characteristics
particular
to
the
best
examples
of
the
style
notes
i
enjoy
pumpkin
ales
but
some
of
them
are
truly
bad
and
this
is
one
glad
i
only
bought
the
single
i
cant
imagine
that
any
brewery
can
continue
to
sell
this
to
anyone
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
and
well
worth
seeking
out
good
stuff
the
taste
is
similare
light
cooked
pumpkin
orange
zest
hint
of
cinnamon
mineral
water
taste
and
feel
finish
of
a
little
pumpkin
mixed
with
grain
and
grass
its
light
and
spritzy
on
the
sweet
side
its
hardly
great
but
its
pretty
good
and
easy
to
drink
d
definitely
not
the
worst
of
the
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
the
pleasure
and
pain
of
sampling
but
i
cant
say
id
have
one
any
time
soon
it
had
been
a
few
years
three
or
four
since
id
had
the
pleasure
of
sampling
buffalo
bills
delight
and
as
i
rememberd
from
the
past
its
nothing
worth
getting
excited
about
many
better
pumpkin
ales
and
many
better
ales
that
arent
pumpkin
nothing
really
worth
seeing
here
even
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
overall
not
a
great
beer
but
i
did
not
find
it
as
terrible
as
some
of
the
previous
raters
did
maybe
its
my
limited
experience
with
pumpkin
ales
or
maybe
im
just
in
a
good
mood
but
definitely
not
something
you
need
to
go
out
and
buy
right
now
if
it
is
already
in
your
fridge
dont
need
to
necessarily
throw
it
out
but
definitely
not
something
i
will
buy
for
myself
what
the
hell
is
this
pumpkin
is
a
rich
sweet
creamy
flavour
pumpkin
with
pie
spices
even
more
so
this
is
watery
insipid
and
bland
i
said
some
even
more
flagrant
things
in
my
original
review
suffice
it
to
say
i
was
incredibly
disappointed
with
my
first
example
of
pumpkin
ale
overall
one
of
the
easiest
and
most
drinkable
pumpkin
beers
ive
ever
had
definitely
good
for
sessioning
pumpkin
ales
are
not
my
favorite
to
begin
with
but
there
are
much
better
examples
of
this
style
on
the
market
for
example
southern
tier
dfh
d
with
all
its
flaws
its
not
a
difficult
beer
to
drink
and
the
spice
profile
is
slightly
interesting
a
poor
example
of
the
style
but
thankfully
not
all
that
offensive
ive
read
some
other
reviews
that
make
it
sound
like
previous
years
were
better
so
heres
to
hoping
they
turn
things
around
and
get
things
going
in
the
other
direction
that
said
they
need
to
just
scrap
whatever
theyre
using
for
that
pumpkin
flavoring
pours
a
murky
orangish
gold
in
color
only
a
little
froth
on
the
pour
other
than
that
no
head
at
all
smell
is
slight
pumpkin
but
lots
of
spice
and
a
whole
lot
of
lager
notes
taste
is
smoked
pumpkin
there
are
some
definite
smoky
notes
that
i
dont
quite
understand
lots
of
carbonation
and
prickliness
in
the
mouthfeel
being
a
pumpkin
beer
there
are
still
a
bunch
of
other
pumpkin
beers
id
take
over
this
this
one
says
on
the
bottle
that
it
is
brewed
by
pyramid
brewing
not
a
very
attractive
beer
with
little
head
and
absolutely
no
lacing
but
not
a
bad
deep
reddish
orange
color
the
nose
is
the
best
feature
hinting
of
a
pumpkin
aroma
lots
of
carbonation
actually
too
much
keeps
this
from
being
as
drinkable
as
it
could
be
the
flavor
is
slightly
pumpkin
blended
with
a
wheat
malt
on
the
palate
just
a
touch
of
bittrness
on
the
rather
clean
finish
thin
mouthfeel
reasonably
refreshing
but
not
a
beer
i
would
rush
out
to
buy
again
the
pour
was
standard
light
amber
and
the
smell
a
hint
and
only
a
hint
of
fall
spices
clove
nutmug
pumpkin
the
taste
not
so
good
over
carbonated
bland
like
the
flavor
was
an
afterthought
bummer
i
would
not
buy
this
again
pours
pure
copper
to
a
small
and
active
head
that
fizzles
like
soda
quickly
dissipates
with
no
trace
and
no
lacing
smell
is
a
combination
of
herbs
and
spices
reminds
me
of
one
of
those
antique
stores
run
by
somebodys
grandma
taste
is
more
spicy
than
pumpkiny
however
there
is
a
predominance
of
acidity
that
is
just
too
uncomfortable
to
deal
with
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
metallic
not
anywhere
near
the
robustness
i
had
expected
all
in
all
im
thoroughly
unimpressed
with
this
beer
i
wont
buy
it
again
and
i
dont
recommend
it
pours
copper
orange
and
clear
into
a
pint
glass
with
miniscule
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
although
some
carbonation
is
active
in
the
glass
aroma
is
minimal
with
traces
of
cloves
orange
and
pumpkin
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
light
and
sandpaperish
from
the
medium
carbonation
taste
is
watery
and
thin
spice
pumpkin
hints
but
seems
to
dissipate
towards
the
finish
spice
seems
a
little
off
balance
not
enough
pumpkin
to
round
it
out
slight
hop
impression
in
the
finish
overall
this
beer
is
fair
moreso
as
it
warms
ill
be
reviewing
several
pumpkin
ales
tonight
i
stopped
by
the
headkeeper
on
the
way
home
and
decided
to
stock
up
the
first
one
is
buffalo
bills
pumpkin
ale
i
tried
it
last
year
and
found
it
pretty
enjoyable
i
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
my
tasting
snifter
i
was
crystal
clear
and
ruby
orange
there
was
a
creamy
white
head
that
gradually
dissipated
the
aroma
had
hints
of
pumpkin
spices
cinnamon
cloves
and
allspice
there
was
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
and
the
flavor
was
good
more
pumpkin
spices
but
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
i
dont
really
know
what
all
has
changed
with
this
beer
from
last
year
maybe
my
tastes
have
matured
but
i
doubt
ill
be
pulling
another
one
of
these
off
the
shelf
lose
some
of
that
carbonation
bill
maybe
try
using
some
actual
pumpkins
next
time
perhaps
take
a
few
notes
from
dogfish
heads
brew
also
please
spare
our
tongues
and
ease
up
on
that
spice
guys
d
not
drinkable
i
will
not
be
having
again
and
ive
officially
written
buffalo
bills
from
the
list
as
i
didnt
care
for
the
orange
cream
ale
too
bad
the
beer
didnt
taste
as
good
as
it
smells
im
glad
i
found
this
in
single
bottles
because
i
wouldnt
have
drank
a
sixer
not
terrible
but
not
something
i
would
have
again
either
as
with
nearly
all
flavored
beers
its
a
decent
taste
but
nothing
id
want
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis

d
well
about

theres
much
better
and

out
there
skip
this
one
d
it
came
as
part
of
a
winter
pack
along
with
9
others
the
other
offerings
seem
a
little
more
promising
but
this
one
was
not
something
id
really
look
to
drink
again
i
wouldnt
drink
this
and
if
it
was
a
part
of
a
mixed
pack
id
seriously
consider
the
value
of
the
pack
as
distributed
across
the
pack
minus
one
beer
since
this
beer
is
only
going
to
be
poured
out
or
given
away
d
ok
by
style
and
ok
drinkability
but
much
better
examples
and
one
i
wouldnt
bother
to
have
a

there
is

but
as

theres
a

taste
that
might
be
the
pumpkin
full
a
few
sips
more
and
i
cant
bring
myself
to

spicy
for
my
palate
i
cant
say
that
ill
ever
want
to
drink
this
again
ill
try
next
years
to
see
if
i
am
crazy
or
not
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
mild
pumpkin
scent
along
with
the
usual
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
ginger
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
unique
flavor
that
im
not
sure
is
good
or
bad
it
has
a
decent
pumpkin
taste
but
the
spices
are
screwed
up
there
is
an
intense
clove
flavor
that
really
sticks
out
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
drinking
pumpkin
ale
if
they
get
the
spices
figured
out
this
could
be
something
to
look
forward
to
each
year
as
it
stands
ill
pass
next
year
overall
not
a
complete
disaster
but
close
probably
twice
as
spiced
as
it
should
be
and
a
bit
too
sweet
to
boot
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
my
girlfriend
talked
me
into
buying
this
one
after
not
wanting
to
i
tried
one
with
her
and
was
plesantly
suprised
not
a
world
class
beer
but
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
a
strong
but
not
dominant
pumpkin
and
spice
aromas
and
flavors
a
decently
creamy
texture
and
no
vegetable
or
grain
flavors
mildly
sweet
and
easy
on
the
palate
finishes
fairly
clean
id
probably
drink
another
with
thanksgiving
dinner
not
an
everyday
thirst
quencher
however
good
carbonation
gives
this
beer
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
nice
drinkability
no
body
and
watery
i
may
have
to
pass
on
this
beer
for
future
pumpkin
endeavors
but
it
will
do
for
now
a
decent
offering
in
the
pumpkin
ale
category
poured
out
to
a
light
orange
color
with
a
largebubbled
14
inch
head
medium
carbonation
aromas
of
pumpkin
and
spice
are
present
along
with
a
cooked
squash
smell
not
bad
taste
is
missing
something
flavors
of
spice
and
pumpkin
are
here
as
are
weak
and
watery
malt
and
hop
characters
somehow
this
brew
just
does
not
blend
all
that
well
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
but
still
not
all
that
bad
drinkability
is
average
nothing
special
here
ive
heard
that
this
brew
can
vary
from
year
to
year
lets
hope
so
as
there
are
many
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
this
year
it
is
drinkable
but
not
one
id
call
a
session
beer
ill
revisit
this
after
ive
had
the
offer
to
try
other
examples
of
the
style
so
i
can
see
how
it
stacks
up
against
the
rest
i
would
never
buy
this
to
drink
again
drinkability
well
sum
it
all
up
right
blech
over
all
id
drink
it
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
all
in
all
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
6er
of
this
one
still
waiting
on
a
pumpkin
brew
that
makes
me
happy
as
it
dispenses
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
the
beer
resides
in
the
glass
a
clarion
amber
with
a
modest
semicreamy
light
tan
head
that
quickly
disappears
leaving
the
lace
to
surround
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
spicy
pumpkin
with
a
nice
bit
of
malt
to
back
it
up
start
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
decent
grain
presence
top
is
light
to
moderate
finish
as
a
decent
acidity
hops
light
but
present
very
dry
aftertaste
bought
two
more
different
pumpkin
ales
for
a
small
tasteoff
maybe
im
wrong
but
i
just
cant
taste
any
traditional
pumpkin
spices
just
fake
cinnamon
id
love
to
see
them
try
again
and
tone
it
down
a
bit
t
the
taste
was
of
a
sweet
variety
with
a
strong
cinnamon
taste
throughout
some
malt
was
there
but
like
dating
your
good
buddys
sister
it
just
didnt
feel
right
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
because
of
the
pour
taste
and
other
factors
the
beer
really
isnt
that
drinkable
i
dont
see
myself
returning
to
this
one
after
this
sixer
is
finished
mouthfeeldrinkability
watery
and
thin
the
7uplike
introduction
on
the
tongue
is
followed
by
a
disappointingly
nondescript
middle
and
finish
so
boring
that
i
sit
here
completely
flabbergasted
that
a
pumpkin
beer
ive
seen
for
years
could
have
been
crafted
so
poorly
with
nothing
interesting
or
great
whatsoever
to
speak
of
id
always
heard
this
was
pretty
bad
and
always
having
better
pumpkin
ales
on
hand
this
is
one
id
never
tried
until
now
and
i
should
have
kept
on
without
it
pours
a
lackluster
golden
color
wheres
the
orange
glow
smells
of
womens
perfume
and
cinnamon
hard
candy
that
latter
flavor
dominates
the
brew
making
it
difficult
to
pick
out
anything
else
lots
of
sugary
cinnamon
here
and
i
think
id
actually
enjoy
it
more
if
it
had
some
heat
to
it
like
those
red
hot
candies
but
it
doesnt
cant
find
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
any
carbonation
bite
or
noticeable
body
yikes
i
love
this
style
but
this
is
just
bad
i
view
pumpkin
beers
as
more
of
a
novelty
than
a
serious
brew
so
i
rarely
expect
to
love
them
its
nice
once
per
year
to
change
things
up
a
little
and
get
a
sixer
or
two
but
if
they
were
available
yearround
i
would
seldom
buy
them
as
far
as
buffalo
bills
is
concerned
this
is
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
a
pumpkin
ale
they
go
a
little
overboard
on
the
cinnamonnetmegclove
flavors
but
isnt
this
what
you
would
want
in
a
pumpkin
beer
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
but
i
wont
sit
down
and
drink
a
sixer
in
one
night
i
just
like
to
throw
it
in
the
mix
im
not
a
huge
pumpkin
beer
fan
but
ill
give
almost
anything
a
try
once
and
it
is
the
season
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
soon
settles
to
nothing
lacing
is
minimal
at
most
aroma
is
all
cinnamon
i
cant
get
past
it
maybe
a
little
sugary
sweetness
underneath
flavor
brings
all
spice
maybe
i
got
this
too
soon
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
and
ginger
but
not
really
any
pumpkin
fizzy
in
mouthfeel
and
watery
in
consistency
different
and
not
really
my
thing
not
good
even
for
a
pumpkin
beer
buffalo
bills
pumpkin
is
a
highly
carbonated
copper
colored
brew
with
a
small
watery
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
spices
cinnamon
dominates
with
something
sweeter
like
nutmeg
lurking
underneath
taste
is
more
of
the
same
the
cinnamon
is
strong
almost
like
an
altoid
or
some
schnapps
a
mild
malt
body
tries
to
keep
the
cinnamon
from
running
wild
nothing
i
can
identify
as
pumpkin
is
present
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
leaves
no
finish
this
is
very
onedimensional
but
for
some
reason
i
still
enjoy
the
strong
cinnamon
taste
this
is
definently
a
beer
that
will
turn
a
lot
of
people
off
even
though
i
like
it
i
doubt
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
and
i
definently
wont
pick
this
up
unless
i
can
get
it
as
a
single
body
hovers
just
between
light
and
medium
is
softly
carbonated
and
creamy
feeling
the
only
way
i
would
want
this
beer
is
served
w
a
warm
slice
of
pumpkin
or
apple
pie
a
la
mode
d
even
thought
the
spices
are
big
and
bold
and
out
shadow
the
flavors
characteristic
of
beer
i
enjoyed
it
the
ginger
aroma
and
the
cinnamon
taste
really
kind
of
work
together
i
dont
think
i
can
drink
any
more
of
this
one
but
i
it
makes
me
want
to
try
a
pumpkin
beer
that
has
a
good
balance
of
pumpkin
spice
and
hops
malt
or
alcohol
this
could
be
the
gateway
pumpkin
beer
well
this
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
expected
but
its
not
really
a
pumpkin
ale
by
my
standards
still
this
thing
isnt
as
bad
as
i
had
figured
oelergud
drinkable
but
there
are
better
punkins
in
the
field
uf
very
light
copper
color
with
just
a
small
white
froth
on
top
of
the
beer
not
much
lacing
to
account
for
smells
like
moldy
pumpkin
pie
or
old
chai
some
pumpkin
but
still
very
musty
very
different
but
not
in
a
good
way
slightly
smokey
and
bitter
bringing
it
far
away
from
what
i
would
expect
a
pumpkin
beer
body
is
far
too
thin
not
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
experience
the
main
problem
with
this
one
overall
is
that
while
tasty
its
not
a
repeat
brew
due
to
the
nonbalance
between
the
pumpkin
and
spice
if
that
was
straghtened
out
a
bit
this
one
would
move
from
fairly
good
to
very
good
methinks
flavors
similar
with
some
allspice
or
clove
malts
covered
up
by
spices
medium
full
body
and
smooth
but
not
dextrinous
mouthfeel
weak
hops
just
balances
the
sweetness
of
malts
but
not
helping
much
in
the
finish
considering
how
much
my
wife
enjoyed
it
i
may
grudgingly
give
it
another
try
probably
at
thanksgiving
like
i
said
cant
wait
pretty
easy
drinking
nonetheless
a
little
thin
id
like
to
try
this
as
a
sweet
stout
still
a
cool
fall
night
and
some
cinnamon
rolls
or
apple
pie
would
go
well
dn
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
i
cant
ive
tried
it
cold
i
let
it
warm
up
all
to
no
avail
i
like
pumpkins
i
think
i
want
to
try
a
dfh
before
avoiding
pumpkin
beers
from
now
on
this
beer
is
just
too
mired
down
by
the
overwhelming
heaviness
of
the
spices
this
is
the
first
beer
in
a
long
time
i
poured
into
the
sink
i
literally
could
not
give
this
beer
away
it
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
not
a
good
pumpkin
pie
one
that
was
once
frozen
and
then
left
out
on
a
counter
for
3
weeks
it
pours
orange
with
a
weak
head
there
are
strong
hints
of
nutmeg
and
cloying
malts
there
isnt
much
pumpkin
flavor
per
se
just
too
sweet
pumpkin
pie
try
ofallon
instead
great
beer
if
you
want
to
drink
1
or
2
and
wait
a
few
days
it
has
too
much
impact
for
beer
picked
up
for
super
cheap
so
i
thought
that
i
would
give
it
a
shot
pours
an
absolutely
flat
copper
color
this
one
didnt
even
bother
to
leave
lace
on
the
glass
oh
well
nose
is
full
of
spice
nutmeg
and
cinnamonn
via
for
attention
with
a
nice
pumpkinish
backbone
taste
is
like
drinking
pumpkin
pie
nothing
subtle
about
this
it
seems
to
be
a
direct
opposite
of
dfhs
pumpkin
beer
which
is
surprisingly
subtle
i
could
see
having
one
of
these
for
dessert
over
the
holidays
but
i
doubt
ill
be
revisiting
very
often
a
new
style
for
me
received
it
in
a
christmas
variety
pack
of
ales
quite
interesting
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
a
head
the
smell
is
of
pumpkin
pie
maybe
a
bit
of
yeast
hops
in
the
background
it
tasted
pretty
good
but
more
like
pumpkin
pie
than
anything
else
the
hops
seemed
to
be
very
mellow
the
malt
stood
out
more
than
anything
other
than
the
spices
but
the
spices
did
not
overwhelm
the
ale
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
with
adequate
carbonation
and
an
enjoyable
smoothness
interesting
not
something
id
look
for
but
a
refreshing
and
curious
change
of
pace
not
so
drinkable
as
i
could
probably
only
have
one
or
two
before
id
want
a
nice
bitter
ipa
overall
impression
tasty
pumpkin
beer
nice
way
to
drink
your
dessert
i
dont
see
myself
wanting
too
many
of
these
at
once
though
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
especially
since
bevmo
was
clearing
it
out
for
2
99
a
six
i
found
this
bottle
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
and
looked
forward
to
giving
it
a
try
if
beers
was
all
sight
and
smells
it
would
rate
highly
with
me
too
bad
it
tastes
so
strangely
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
light
tanbrown
body
with
little
head
or
apparent
body
nose
is
big
and
spicy
reeking
allspice
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
like
some
sort
of
chai
spiced
tea
infusion
taste
is
thin
but
insistent
on
the
chai
spiciness
i
thought
too
much
allspice
and
nutmeg
and
too
little
pumpkin
and
body
body
is
indeed
thin
and
the
carbonation
high
not
bad
but
not
the
type
of
pumpkin
ale
i
was
expecting
advice
buy
a
sixer
to
split
with
some
friends
if
you
want
to
try
it
pumpkin
beer
sounds
like
a
holiday
treat
or
is
it
poured
with
14
head
that
dissipated
to
nothing
quickly
no
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
pint
glass
coppery
clear
orange
in
color
smells
of
spices
but
the
candy
sweetness
is
not
there
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
flavors
blend
with
the
pumpkinor
do
they
make
up
the
impression
of
pumpkin
i
dont
know
high
carbonation
for
this
mediumbodied
ale
im
kind
of
a
newbie
to
the
world
that
is
pumpkin
ales
and
this
one
left
me
desiring
a
better
example
of
the
style
alexgashdec
01
i
think
if
they
upped
the
pumpkin
input
and
the
malts
to
add
a
little
sweetness
this
would
be
a
good
beer
just
not
enough
body
and
sweetness
for
me
to
enjoy
this
one
so
maybe
there
are
better
ones
around
assuming
there
are
since
this
one
doesnt
get
that
great
marks
will
search
out
some
others

but
it
certainly
wasnt
what
i
was
hoping
for
pours
a
crystalclear
goldenorange
with
no
head
or
lace
to
speak
of
smells
of
strong
sweet
cinnamon
it
is
a
little
too
bitter
for
the
pumpkin
pie
lover

edition
but
this
really
should
be
called
pumpkin
pie
ale
since
the
focus
is
on
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
pumpkin
is
relegated
to
the
background
which
is
a
shame
since
the
hearty
squash
flavors
of
pumpkin
marry
well
with
both
malt
and
hops
malt
is
sweet
just
the
traditional
cinnamon
not
because
i
love
pumpkins
or
the
idea
of
a
pumpkin
beer
not
much
appeal

but
the
hopping
seems
way
out
of
place
what
a
difference
a
few
years
make
looking
at
my
original
review
some
pumpkin
it
has
a

i
used
this
beer

as
an

a

i
would
the
look
and
feel
are
not
much
different
than
others
of
its
style
the
fun
is
in
the
spices
nutmeg
and
some

pretty

poured

into

this

the
most
pumpkin
forward
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
spices
are
there
but
very
subtle
very
low
carb
this
is
release

so
some
of
the
spices
may
have
fallen
out
also
the
bottle
looked
underfilled
to
my
eye
overall
a
very
pumpkin
foward
beer
with
not
a
whole
lots
else
going
on
i
enjoyed
trying
it
but
probably
wont
grab
another
unless
its
super
fresh
for
comparison
pours
a
dark
and
toasty
blackish
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
roasted
with
some
pumpkin
and
spice
notes
also
coming
forth
upfront
in
the
flavor
there
is
plenty
of
roasted
character
followed
up
by
the
pumpkin
pie
taste
and
mocha
even
just
a
bit
of
spices
mainly
just
pumpkin
and
roasted
malt
here
but
they
definitely
work
well
together
full
bodied
well
carbonated
ale
the
pumpkin
stout
is
becoming
a
big
trend
in
seasonal
beer
here
in
the
states
with
these
flavor
combinations
it
can
easily
be
understood
why
epic
and
dc
brau
definitely
bring
the
flavors
in
this
beer
definitely
roasted
flavors
with
a
warm
finish
oa
good
pumpkin
beer
wish
it
leaned
more
pumpkin
than
porter
o
really
great
complex
brew
lots
of
different
traits
on
this
one
that
make
it
worth
getting
glad
to
have
gotten
it
drinkable
but
uninspired
disappointing
for
a
collab
ignoring
the
pumpkin
aspect
of
this
i
really
like
the
milky
charry
chocolatey
coffee
and
nutmeg
that
this
offers
the
pumpkin
isnt
pronounced
enough
for
me
to
really
think
of
this
as
pumpkin
beer
or
to
distract
from
the
above
mentioned
flavours
that
just
so
happen
to
be
right
up
my
alley

was

this
is
a
good

to

with
fruit

apples

pears
or
even
a

would
be

ventureif
you
can
get
one
during
the
season
of
its
release
ill
admit
that
i
have
rarely
been
thrilled
with
pumpkin
beers
so
my
lukewarm
perspective
may
be
slanted
but
its
a
creative
brew
not
cloying
or
out
of
balance
so
ill
take
it
as
an
autumn
accompaniment
to
football
season
o
a
different
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
that
worked
nicely
with
the
robust
porter
id
like
to
see
more
pumpkin
portersstouts
overall
an
unexpected
surprise
this
may
be
one
i
seek
out
each
fall
overall
great
beer
very
much
a
porter
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
and
spice
not
an
overwhelming
pumpkin
flavor
nice
solid
porter
needs
to
be
a
bit
warm
to
enjoy
the
flavors
coffee
smoked
malt
and
a
bit
of
squash
and
earthy
flavors
in
the
back
straightforward
in
body
and
flavor
with
cola
adding
drinkability
striking
bitterness
not
dry
for
a
porter
pumpkin
flavor
is
simple
and
smart
i
appreciate
the
restraint
on
spice
overall
a
good
beer
and
a
fun
play
on
a
porter
but
the
flavors
are
too
restrained
to
be
especially
memorable
overall
outstanding
its
not
an
overkill
like
other
pumpkin
beers
are
it
is
well
executed
in
a
porter
the
smell
was
truly
outstanding
overall
this
is
a
pumpkin
spice
porter
finishes
easy
and
i
enjoyed
this
beer
o
this
is
a
very
well
made
porter
pumpkin
ale
hybrid
not
as
smoky
as
a
great
porters
go
not
as
overpowering
and
robust
as
most
great
pumpkin
ales
go
but
a
damn
solid
hybrid
beer
made
by
two
great
beer
companies
that
i
will
introduce
friends
to
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
for
me
it
was
a
porter
first
with
support
from
the
pumpkin
and
pie
flavors
if
youre
looking
for
a
pumpkin
beer
that
isnt
overly
sweet
or
heavy
this
is
for
you
i
would
absolutely
buy
this
again
in
fact
i
will
not
outstanding
but
very
smooth
goes
down
easily
for
its
strength
which
is
substantial
its
all
about

unlike
a

porter
in
my
eyes
not
as
thick
as
a
stout
should
feel
overall
combined
with
aroma
and
flavor
this
type
of
beer
is
ideal
for
me
just
wish
the
sweetness
of
the
aroma
permeated
through
the
taste
into
something
creamier
and
bitier
the
sourness
of
the
after
taste
and
almost
acridness
takes
away
from
what
the
aroma
promises
but
overall
decent
the
beer
purists
that
want
ales
to
lead
with
more
porter
character
will
enjoy
the
subtlties
of
the
pumpkin
influence
found
here
but
the
true

wont
command
the
taste

ales
do

i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
out
of
this
offering
but
i
will
say
that
it
was
still
a
pretty
good
overall
beer
that
was
very
drinkable
i
would
have

to
see
a

more
more

than

strength
overall
not
a
bad
beer
this
had
better
balance
than
many
of
the
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
so
far
i
think
the
darker
malts
add
complexity
and
play
well
with
the
spices
not
a
lot
of
actual
pumpkin
character
comes
through
though
just
like
most
of
the
prior
examples
this
has
an
astringent
noteim
starting
to
wonder
if
that
is
from
the
spices
or
from
pumpkin
itself
i
have
never
had
a
pumpkin
porter
so
i
was
excited
to
try
this
one
it
pours
a
deep
brown
basically
black
held
up
to
the
light
you
can
tell
it
is
actually
brown
the
smell
is
filled
with
chocolate
roasted
malts
there
are
also
hints
of
vanilla
and
spices
riding
along
but
the
chocolate
malt
is
the
main
force
here
the
taste
is
it
rich
and
dark
after
the
3rd
sip
i
can
start
to
taste
the
spices
come
through
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
like
the
idea
of
the
pumpkin
porter
and
this
one
is
good
if
i
ever
see
anymore
like
this
ill
give
them
a
try
o
again
this
is
a
year
old
its
an
alright
porter
however
the
pumpkin
qualities
while
there
are
nowhere
as
present
as
id
like
them
to
be
perhaps
theyre
stronger
in
fresher
bottles
it
can
stand
on
its
own
as
a
porter
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
pumpkin
porter
this
year
old
bottle
wont
give
you
what
youre
searching
for
good
thick
head
a
solid
rich
dark
color
moderate
lacing
carbonating
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
not
weak
or
flat
smells
strongly
of
nutmeg
vanilla
bean
but
not
so
much
pumpkin
the
taste
however
taste
like
pumpkin
and
vanilla
i
definitely
have
the
urge
to
make
a
pumpkin
porter
shake
with
this
one
its
got
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
has
a
good
crispness
to
it
for
a
porter
very
drinkable
overall
my
favorite
pumpkin
porter
next
to
four
peaks
finally
the
beer
drinks
smoothly
with
a
creamy
quality
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
masked
a
good
beer
yet
something
seems
to
be
missing
i
cant
place
my
finger
on
it
but
this
beer
certainly
doesnt
quite
compete
with
the
best
in
the
business
good

this

the

make
this

worth
exploring
excellent

the
flavors
a
really
good
interesting
twist
on
the
pumpkin

style
o
i
originally
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
loved
it
it
is
not
as
great
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
improves
as
it
get
closer
to
room
temperature
porters
and
stouts
are
a
style
i
think
is
better
suited
for
pumpkin
beer
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
are
complimentary
to
the
pumpkin
spices
o
ive
had
several
pumpkin
portersstouts
recently
and
to
me
they
just
dont
work
as
the
pumpkin
gets
hidden
that
being
said
pumpkin
advertising
aside
this
is
a
decent
porter
but
not
worth
the
12
price
of
admission
o
not
bad
im
only
like
4
beers
in
which
comes
through
more
in
the
flavor
didnt
get
a
lot
of
pumpkin
flavor
from
this
though
certainly
get
chocolate

this

that

a
good
offering
from
epic
brewing
dc
brau
this
was
my
first
dc
brau
but
certainly
adds
some
tartness
and
a
bit
of
a
squash
vegetal
note
to
this
beer
the
spice
character
here
is
actually
somewhat
restrained
compared
to
most
pumpkin
beers
and
it
actually
works
pretty
well
i
am
surprised
that
i
am
not
getting
an
anise
aroma
or
flavor
from
this
beer
though
as
that
seems
to
be
one
of
the
more
noticeable
notes
in
beers
that
have
had
fivespice
added
to
them
though
perhaps
this
blend
of
fivespice
is
different
an
interesting
go
at
a
pumpkin
porter
it
could
really
use
a
touch
more
body
and
rounded
malt
flavor
to
balance
out
the
spiciness
and
the
roast
bitterness
that
can
be
a
touch
distracting
in
this
beer

the

go
a

a

this
is

this
combo
is
among
the
best
stuff
ive
tried
from
them
daniellobonov

the
taste
didnt
live
up
to
it
also
think
the
carbonation
on
this
needs
to
be
ratcheted
up
a
touch
this
one
is
slightly
flat
overall
delicious
beer
tons
of
pumpkin
pie
flavors
but
not
too
sweet
ill
certainly
get
it
again
next
fall
o
this
beer
is
really
up
and
down
great
look
weak
aromas
easy
drinking
taste
but
average
comlexity
good
body
seems
like
a
mild
ipa
if
the
label
didnt
have
a
pumpkin
on
it
i
wouldnt
know
the
difference
o
the
bitterness
is
high
and
the
pumpkin
is
low
not
exactly
what
i
expected
from
a
pumpkin
ale
i
have
been
drinking
ciscos
beers
since
they
started
but
i
had
yet
to
try
their
pumpkin
ale
on
the
pour
everything
looked
great
rich
amber
color
really
nice
head
offwhite
in
color
with
fine
lacing
the
pumpkin
aroma
was
very
slight
and
so
alas
was
the
taste
which
was
mostly
a
hoppy
bitterness
i
could
only
make
out
a
little
pumpkin
flavor
and
no
spices
whatsoever
as
the
bitterness
overwhelmed
if
you
want
your
pumpkin
ale
to
taste
more
like
a
pale
ale
this
is
for
you
but
if
i
get
a
pumpkin
ale
i
want
to
taste
the
pumpkin
and
this
beer
didnt
hold
its
own
in
that
regard
mouthfeel
is
good
i
would
get
this
one
again
overall
decent
autumn
beer
i
like
that
its
spiced
up
front
i
had
this
with
some
squash
tacos
and
it
was
a
nice
autumnal
pairing
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
thats
still
smuttynose
as
of
now
but
not
half
bad
o
some
guy
at
hop
city
in
atlanta
convinced
me
to
buy
this
one
he
thought
it
was
the
shit
in
pumpkin
beers
wrong
a
real
waste
of
sip
and
money
pass
on
this
boring
offering
noticing
the
julian
dating
after
purchase
i
realized
pumple
drumkin
was
canned
mid
july
3
months
before
consumption
im
wondering
if
there
is
a
hop
presence
that
may
have
been
more
noticeable
closer
to
the
canning
date
next
season
ill
seek
this
one
out
closer
to
the
canning
date
to
see
if
the
hops
are
more
of
a
factor
easy
drinking
pumpkin
ale
worth
a
shot
serving
type
bottle
light
almost
watery
to
me
the
beer
tasted
like
your
average
pale
ale
with
grainy
hops
and
minimal
sweetness
but
then
had
some
pumpkin
notes
added
it
and
the
pumpkin
is
minimal
at
best
i
can
only
hypothesize
that
the
90pt
rating
from
the
bros
is
because
if
i
was
sitting
with
a
bunch
of
pumpkin
beers
and
had
taste
fatigue
i
might
find
a
plain
old
ipa
to
be
a
refreshing
change
but
when
i
come
in
from
work
for
my
one
beer
not
one
of
a
tasting
panel
this
one
sorely
disappointed
me
overall
completely
unimpressed
with
this
beer
i
have
had
many
pumpkin
beers
that
tasted
better
than
this
i
rarely
if
ever
say
this
about
beer
ive
been
drinking
craft
beer
whenever
i
can
find
it
and
found
this
at
a
grocery
store
near
me
that
sells
mixed
6
packs
where
you
can
choose
them
this
was
the
last
one
i
picked
out
since
i
hadnt
had
it
before
it
was
in
a
can
not
a
bottle
so
maybe
this
contributed
to
the
flavor
of
the
beer
or
got
a
bad
banch
of
it
when
i
first
smelled
it
it
smelled
like
it
had
skunked
or
been
sour
but
tasted
it
and
it
tasted
just
plain
horrible
the
pumpkin
spice
that
its
advertised
as
being
a
pumpkin
beer
was
missing
and
tasted
very
very
watered
down
this
was
the
second
time
ive
ever
poured
out
a
beer
after
my
horrible
experience
with
a
3
year
old
can
of
narragansett
bock
it
tasted
almost
just
like
that
perhaps
it
wasnt
fresh
or
in
a
can
like
i
said
ive
had
ciscos
whale
tale
and
grey
lady
and
theyre
alright
but
i
will
have
to
follow
this
up
sometime
in
another
form
i
do
not
recommend
2
85
ehhhhhhhhh
worst
beer
i
ever
had
last
year
dumped
the
rest
but
one
down
the
drain
to
save
some
other
soul
from
having
to
endure
the
taste
tried
the
one
i
saved
again
just
too
be
sure
and
it
hit
the
drain
too
too
scared
of
loosing
my
beer
palate
to
attempt
buying
it
this
year
yuck
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
head
that
dies
quickly
the
aroma
is
fu
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
the
taste
has
a
fair
bitterness
along
with
spices
and
a
but
if
vegetal
pumpkin
hoppy
pumpkin
ale
interesting
still
had
the
spice
and
pumpkin
notes
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
ale
not
not
bad
but
a
strange
flavor
the
beginning
dully
sweet
and
the
end
sharply
bitter
just
doesnt
hit
my
pallet
quite
right
good
pumpkin
beer
that
complements
slight
pumpkin
and
spice
well
as
well
as
keeps
the
integrety
of
a
beer
flavor
not
overkill
on
the
cinnamon
clove
nutmeg
etc
medium
mouth
feel
with
more
pumpkin
aromas
than
taste
good
session
pumpkin
beer
overall
and
would
recommed
for
those
who
dont
want
too
much
spice
in
their
pumpkin
seasonals
despite
its
mediumbodied
upstart
dissolves
quite
effortlessly
in
its
finish
a
spicy
heated
and
drying
tactile
sensation
follows
to
offer
a
moderate
sense
of
drinkability
and
sociability
to
the
session
its
dry
starchiness
is
laden
with
skeletons
of
spice
and
sweetness
that
aridly
reminds
the
palate
and
memory
of
pumpkin
pie
mouthfeel

this

is

crisp
at

theres
a

in

the

some

a
bit
of
malts
rates
a
meh
at

overall
this
beer
is
not
good
to
be
honest
it
has
the
harsh
and
metallic
flavors
that
i
associate
with
oldstyle
homebrew
before
we
really
understood
the
need
for
fresh
ingredients
and
sanitation
sj
and
i
had
to
pour
this
out
after
a
couple
sips
not
a
great
start
from
this
brewery
but
id
still
try
another
of
their
beers
before
boycotting
them
drumkin
tastes
better
after
its
had
a
chance
to
warm
slightly
did
anyone
else
see
todays
brevity
comic
strip
in
which
linus
goes
into
shock
upon
hearing
a
young
woman
exiting
starbucks
say
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
latte
ha
this
was
fairly
drinkable
the
other
night
after
my
tastebuds
were
fried
for
what
thats
worth
i
had
to
pour
most
of
it
down
the
drain
i
dont
know
if
this
was
a
bad
batch
or
if
this
was
what
pumple
drumkin
is
supposed
to
be
but
it
was
not
an
experience
id
want
anyone
to
have
to
repeat
o
its
drinkable
really
looks
good
but
i
would
have
to
admit
the
flavor
profile
on
this
is
off
the
metallic
finish
doesnt
do
it
justice
an
okay
pumpkin
ale
even
though
its
not
as
rich
or
as
thick
other
ales
its
october
and
time
for
pumpkin
beers
halloween
is
just
around
the
corner
this
beer
scares
me
just
seems
a
little
unbalanced
overall
decent
flavors
but
not
well
united
unfortunately
pours
a
two
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
clear

color
medium
carbonation

o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
representative
of
the
already
undersiege
pumpkin
style
dont
know
what
happened
with
this
beer
but
you
can
do
better
the
flavor
is
good
actually
it
impresses
me
with
more
flavor
than
the
aroma
lets
on
with
some
gentle
woodiness
of
ginger
with
a
light
nutmeg
like
aspect
and
perhaps
some
clove
adding
to
the
taste
of
slight
fruitiness
from
the
yeast
the
malt
takes
a
back
seat
but
still
supports
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
adding
some
sweetness
to
the
spice
and
yeast
which
is
pretty
seamless
overall
i
recommend
this
to
fans
of
the
style
since
i
enjoyed
how
balanced
it
was
i
like
the
fact
that
you
get
the
spice
without
it
overwhelming
the
taste
it
compliments
in
every
way

the

the

part
of
this

this
is
my
first
time
drinking
it
and
to
me
doesnt
taste
anything
like
pumpkin
the
label
i
think
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
the
little
pumpkin
dude
is
the
cutest
little
thing
o
good
taste
and
aroma
not
so
certain
about
the
feel
ive
had
pumpkin
ales
that
transcend
this
in
spicing
and
aroma
this
is
good
at
best
overall
a
fair
pumpkin
beer
i
like
pumpkin
beers
that
are
either
interesting
beers
with
light
spicing
or
complex
spiced
beers
with
good
balance
this
is
neitherits
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
stands
out
about
it
the
spicing
is
so
much
in
the
background
so
it
doesnt
stand
out
as
a
pumpkin
beer
either
so
glad
the
fall
season
has
returned
cheers
like
the
aroma
the
taste
is
just
rather
bland
some
malts
can
be
found
but
little
sweetness
a
shortlived
low
bitterness
at
the
end
it
has
a
cardboardlike
character
im
sorry
to
say
i
always
look
for
the
positives
in
every
beer
i
review
but
this
was
quite
frankly
a
very
weak
pumpkin
brew
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
a
nicelooking
beer
golden
and
orange
highlights
white
head
very
good
lacing
throughout
the
entire
session
not
much
doing
on
the
nose
nothing
offensive
to
be
sure
but
nothing
overly
special
some
coriander
very
faint
pumpkin
orange
peel
the
taste
is
much
more
intense
for
me
and
my
preferences
this
is
a
good
tasting
pumpkin
spiced
ale
in
that
theres
a
heavier
emphasis
on
the
spice
flavors
and
not
on
the
pumpkin
so
its
not
like
youre
quaffing
some
beer
out
of
a
hollowedout
orange
squash
but
rather
the
spices
and
other
ingredients
used
remind
me
of
autumn
mulling
spices
fresh
gingersnap
cookies
made
with
molasses
cinnamon
sticks
nutmeg
allspice
corn
candied
citrus
a
lighterbodies
beer
and
for
me
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
perhaps
if
it
was
not
labeled
a
pumpkin
beer
i
would
have
liked
it
more
but
given
the
expectations
it
was
definitely
a
let
down
one
caveat
is
that
i
switched
off
drinking
tastes
of
this
with
another
brands
pumpkin
beer
version
the
other
brands
pumpkin
beer
had
much
more
pumpkin
and
spice
taste
which
only
served
to
accentuate
such
absence
in
the
pumple
drumkin
this
is
an
awesome
pumpkin
beer
appearance
is
a
bit
darker
than
most
and
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
very
understated
which
i
prefer
to
the
pumpkinpieinyourface
varieties
after
a
few
sips
i
almost
forgot
i
was
drinking
a
pumpkin
ale
it
tastes
more
like
a
pale
ale
with
a
nice
hop
character
and
dry
finish
but
as
the
hops
fade
a
lingering
pumpkin
aftertaste
surfaces
until
the
next
sip
first
time
ive
had
this
brew
but
its
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorites
pleasant
mild
aroma
of
roasted
pumpkin
with
caramel
notes
taste
is
mild
pumpkin
with
weak
spice
that
fades
into
a
predominant
floral
grapefruit
grassy
bitter
finish
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
pumpkin
ipa
if
there
is
such
a
thing
i
cannot
speak
for
all
pumpkin
beer
lovers
but
when
i
think
of
pumpkin
beer
i
am
thinking
of
the
flavor
of
pumpkin
pie
which
is
not
bitter
o
as
far
as
pumpkins
go
this
has
a
good
taste
but
a
bit
mild
so
if
you
dont
want
an
over
the
top
pumpkincinnamon
taste
this
is
a
good
start
overall
not
like
i
remembered
this
from
last
year
not
wellbalanced
the
flavors
dont
mesh
well
together
no
sweetness
a
real
letdown
i
dont
even
know
how
to
respond
to
the
story
on
the
side
of
the
can
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
auburn
topped
by
a
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
light
graham
cracker
brown
sugar
clove
a
pinch
of
cinnamon
and
toast
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
stronger
toast
component
this
time
almost
seeming
like
toasted
pumpkin
seeds
for
once
the
spicing
in
a
pumpkin
ale
is
present
but
restrained
a
welcome
change
even
for
a
sweettoothed
spicehound
like
myself
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
slick
feel
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
solid
enough
pumpkin
ale
one
that
tones
down
the
spices
compared
to
others
while
maintaining
a
healthy
balance
with
the

a

slightly
more

still

head
is

are

that
this
wont
be
killed

over

good

is
sublte
as
well
amber
ale
base
with
flavors
of
raw
pumkin
and
spices
on
the
back
not
an
over
done
spiced
pumpkin
which
i
like
but
the
beer
lacks
complexity
decent
and
i
dont
mind
drinking
because
it
not
ruined
with
marketing
spices
im
not
really
impressed
with
this
pumpkin
ale
the
spice
blend
is
all
wrong
and
its
really
not
sweet
enough
o
overall
its
decent
for
the
style
but
clearly
lacking
any
big
pumpkin
flavor
plenty
of
spice
though
had
at
the
cloverleaf
in
caldwell
nj
nice
looking
amber
brew
a
tiny
bit
of
head
nose
was
spicy
some
slight
citrus
present
taste
was
a
little
lacking
in
pumpkin
but
otherwise
a
nice
ale
good
mouthfeel
velvety
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
consumed
wish
i
could
have
quaffed
more
i
poured
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
clear
copper
color
body
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
lays
down
quiet
quickly
the
smell
has
a
spicey
hoppy
smell
to
it
the
taste
has
a
spicy
hop
flavor
to
it
with
some
pumpkin
spices
coming
through
on
the
middle
of
the
tongue
i
get
a
slight
pumpkin
flavor
but
more
malt
on
the
back
of
the
tonuge
the
mouth
feel
is
good
smooth
a
little
more
heavier
than
other
pumpkins
but
good
overall
this
is
good
but
needs
less
spice
and
hops
and
more
pumpkin
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
by
a
long
shot
but
this
is
growing
on
me
a
bit
as
i
drink
through
the
sixer
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
thin
cap
the
smell
and
taste
is
quite
gingery
and
lacks
a
lot
of
the
other
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
is
also
quite
a
bit
thinner
than
id
like
there
is
a
chalkiness
to
the
brew
as
well
as
though
raw
spices
were
just
dumped
in
completely
lacks
the
silkiness
of
the
pumpkin
either
it
wasnt
used
or
not
enough
was
or
perhaps
the
raw
spices
just
overwhelm
it
the
spices
leave
a
bit
of
a
bitter
taste
in
the
mouth
but
the
ginger
note
is
pretty
tasty
nevertheless
needs
more
balance
or
at
least
more
integration
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
bodied
with
medium
to
mediumlow
level
carbonation
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
a
fairly
smooth
somewhat
creamy
and
foamy
beer
but
it
is
also
disappointingly
watery
as
the
glass
wears
on
finish
is
semidry
malty
aroma
has
a
yeasty
overtone
and
a
hint
of
spice
pours
a
clear
dark
bubbly
amber
with
a
thick
pale
wheat
head
malty
flavor
has
a
hint
of
pumpkin
and
more
than
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
smooth
texture
has
about
average
body
and
not
a
whole
lot
of
fizz
if
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
worthy
of
at
least
a
try
o
greatly
disappointed
in
this
one
it
just
doesnt
work
pours
dark
amber

a
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
1inch
cap
moderate
aromas
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
roasted
nuts
fairly
middleoftheroad
but
pretty
nice
hovers
around
the
spice
end
of
the
pumpkin
spice
spectrum
with
more
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
nice
and
drinkable
like
every
other
cisco
brew
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
medium
body
and
ample
carbonation
nice
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
that
doesnt
try
to
reinvent
the
wheel
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
that
i
have
sampled
this
season
pours
a
light
burnt
orange
color
active
and
bubbly
white
head
scent
leads
with
some
notes
of
seasonal
spice
lighter
on
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
some
floral
and
lemony
hoppyness
biscuity
sweetness
and
light
green
apple
where
is
my
pumpkin
not
in
the
flavor
either
odd
combination
of
light
spicing
floral
notes
and
lemon
and
green
apple
lighter
side
of
medium
spritzy
was
wondering
if
this
was
another
shipyard
with
no
actual
pumpkin
used
pours
an
amber
maple
syrup
brown
color
with
thin
lacing
usual
smell
and
flavor
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
sweet
malts
its
a
good
mellow
pumpkin
ale
not
overly
spicy
but
nice
flavors
good
not
amazing
taste
is
alright
fairly
mild
and
easy
drinking
seems
a
little
watery
and
flimsy
after
sitting
with
it
for
a
bit
lacks
much
pumpkin
character
though
some
mild
spice
does
linger
nutmeg
cinnamon
etc
plain
and
not
over
the
top
could
do
worse
though
this
beer
isnt
offering
much
in
the
originality
department
overall
very
enjoyable
brew
certainly
one
of
the
better
pumpkins
ales
o
overall
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
a
decent
amount
of
spice
and
pepper
to
it
but
easy
to
drink
would
have
it
again
though
i
drank
it
side
by
side
with
the
greenport
harbor
leaf
pile
pumpkin
ale
and
preferred
that
one
a
little
more
onot
for
the
untrained
palate
as
the
notes
are
practically
unnoticeable
but
a
decent
ale
for
the
time
of
the
year
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
brownish
orange
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
dead
settles
not
leaving
much
behind
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
moderately
spiced
with
a
subtle
malt
profile
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
decent
amount
of
spices
in
there
too
there
is
a
decent
malt
base
to
this
beer
also
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sharp
on
the
carbonation
there
is
a
bit
of
warming
sensation
going
on
too
from
the
spices
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
not
something
id
look
forward
too
having
each
year
but
it
was
nice
to
try
o
certainly
this
beer
could
have
been
better
it
seems
to
be
one
of
those
brews
that
was
half
formed
o
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
is
that
while
you
have
the
flavors
and
pumpkin
and
traditional
pumpkin
pie
spices
but
not
added
sweetness
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
and
has
none
of
the
artificial
flavors
that
you
often
get
in
this
style
overall
this
is
an
above
average
pumpkin
ale
my
wife
says
this
is
a
pumpkin
she
could
actually
drink
and
she
does
not
like
pumpkin
ales
at
all
wasnt
quite
up
my
alley
so
draw
your
own
conclusions
there
o
started
out
promising
and
ended
up
just
decent
glad
i
tried
it
but
much
better
options
out
there
toasted
malts
up
front
singed
caramel
and
pulpy
gourd
maltiness
fills
in
again
as
in
the
nose
there
is
a
zesty
citrus
element
livening
up
the
palate
peppery
floral
herbal
hop
bitterness
in
the
latter
half
as
well
requisite
pumpkin
beer
spices
show
up
too
but
they
are
not
too
brash
and
fit
in
nicely
medium
body
with
a
lively
feel
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
so
far
this
season
o
this
is
what
a
pumpkin
beer
should
be
im
not
a
fan
of
ones
that
dominate
with
spices
and
dont
let
pumpkin
flavor
and
aroma
come
through
this
is
very
balanced
and
drinkable
d
yikes
the
aroma
is
about
what
one
would
expect
but
the
flavor
profile
is
really
bland
and
the
extra
dry
finish
doesnt
help
things
very
little
identifiable
spice
character
though
there
is
some
hotdog
water
like
character
in
the
background
im
really
unimpressed
with
this
the
pumpkin
flavors
in
the
first
sip
seem
muted
and
garbled
the
malt
is
the
strongest
and
most
consistent
taste
coming
off
the
blocks
im
going
to
let
it
warm
for
a
few
minutes
and
see
if
that
improves
matters
the
quick
break
also
seems
to
embolden
the
hop
flavors
which
control
the
finish
and
aftertaste
mouthfeel
could
use
a
little
more
stiffness
not
a
bad
little
pumpkin
but
a
little
disappointing
after
the
great
first
impression
pumpkin
ales
walk
a
fine
line
between
too
spicy
and
not
spicy
enough
this
is
the
latter
this
beer
was
a
fantastic
full
bodied
pumpkin
flavored
and
spiced
beer
the
flavors
are
not
too
overwhelming
but
compliment
the
beer
in
a
fantastic
way
cisco
brewery
makes
a
great
select
of
beers
include
grey
lady
and
whales
tale
pale
ale
i
wish
cisco
brewery
made
kegs
o
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
again
o
a
fairly
mediocre
pumpkin
ale
overall
it
smells
nice
but
the
taste
is
rather
bland
and
odd
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
pumpkin
beer
if
you
want
some
flavors
of
spices
and
pumpkins
and
something
that
doesnt
seem
sweet
and
artificial
i
have
to
admit
iam
not
big
on
drinking
pumpkin
ales
when
its
90
degrees
still
outside
but
i
bought
the
first
one
of
the
year
today
poured
into
a
nonic
a
clear
deep
burnt
orange
with
a
12
finger
white
head
that
left
no
lace
as
it
settled
pretty
quickly
this
is
a
spiced
ale
no
doubt
with
aromas
of
cardamom
and
clove
dominating

a
perfect

this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
i
encountered
it
a
few
years
ago
back
home
in
atlanta
at
a
place
called
the
porter
it
has
a
lovely
blood
red
color
and
a
pinkish
foam
that
ive
never
seen
in
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
it
has
hints
of
apple
orange
and
a
floral
print
somewhere
from
what
i
tasted
at
6
66
abv
its
a
devilishly
delightful
drink
its
a
little
thin
in
your
mouth
which
doesnt
really
make
a
lot
of
sense
considering
the
flavor
you
get
also
the
smell
doesnt
really
hit
you
as
hard
as
i
think
it
should
but
those
two
things
are
minor
compared
to
the
beautiful
flavor
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
nothing
to
brag
about
it
was
drinkable
i
will
only
have
it
this
once
o
this
beer
seems
like
it
is
much
higher
in
alcohol
than
it
is
since
the
alcohol
is
not
well
hidden
at
all
not
the
easiest
beer
in
this
style
to
drink
this
might
be
a
better
beer
for
drinking
with
some
roasted
pork
than
after

o
interesting
appearance
for
an
oktoberfest
seasonal
but
it
fits
better
for
the
halloween
theme
not
as
flavorful
or
as
big
a
malt
profile
as
the
usual
oktoberfest
seasonal
but
the
berry
addition
makes
it
a
very
unique
beer
especially
being
characterized
as
an
amberred
lager
great
beer
and
if
in
the
mood
for
an
amber
lager
this
would
be
high
on
the
list
o
pretty
good
beer
not
something
that
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
is
certainly
not
an
oktoberfest
beer
which
it
is
sort
of
advertised
as
it
is
categorized
on
this
site
as
a
redamber
lager
in
that
this
is
an
above
average
red
in
my
opinion
whoa
got

ingredients
plus
mild
malts
peppercorns
melon
rind
bitter
hops
sangria
overall
a
tasty
brew
with

color
and

should
it
taste
like
an
octoberfest
well
on
the
label
it
says
its
not
that
style
its
a
freaktoberfest
beer
im
ok
with
that
it
seems
like
many
reviewers
take
away
because
of
the
color
lack
of
imperial
taste
or
the
like
might
have
been
good
to
try
this
brew
without
seeing
its
color
then
rating
it
in
comparison
this
is
an
example
of
why
i
believe
the
appearance
should
be
of
much
less
significance
than
the
aroma
and
especially
the
taste
the
proof
is
in
the
pudding
and
even
with
probably
a
few
more
months
of
aging
than
is
appropriate
this
beer
taste
good
not
imperially
great
but
i
dont
find
anything
significantly
wrong
and
it
has
good
body
flavors
and
tastes
also
great
to
pour
at
a
blind
tasting
i
think
its
another
very
interesting
beer
from
schmaltz
one
of
my
favorite
us
breweries
o
once
i
notice
the
blood
offflavor
in
a
beer
its
hard
to
get
past
lacks
the
clean
taste
and
feel
that
a
lager
should
have
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
pours
a
red
color
with
a
very
light
haze
looks
almost
like
koolaid
and
a
pint
foamy
head
which
has
good
retention
the
smells
are
mostly
malty
some
biscuit
caramel
fruit
grass
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
good
enough
a
little
syrup
sweetness
some
biscuit
but
then
more
bitterness
than
expected
perhaps
some
rye
decent
bitterness
for
a
beer
that
one
would
presume
to
be
an
octoberfest
round
start
of
lightly
toasted
malt
the
finish
is
peppery
bitterness
the
body
leans
toward
watery
but
the
carbonation
is
low
o
so
unique
its
like
a
ciderwine
mets
a
marzen
and
has
a
baby
its
never
too
sweet
the
bready
malts
and
cranberry
bitterness
keep
that
in
check
not
really
an
example
of
the
style
but
an
awesome
off
beat
brew
overall
not
a
bad
brew
actually
pretty
good
not
a
fan
of
the
artificial
coloring
but
its
not
a
deal
breaker
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
small
snifter
pink
head
fluffy
with
good
retention
oily
soapy
lacing
ruby
red
body
aroma
of
sweet
maltiness
candi
like
sugars
hop
bitterness
and
maybe
some
raspberry
taste
has
a
nice
malt
sweetness
some
resinous
grapefruit
bitterness
not
really
getting
any
fruit
on
the
taste
maybe
the
color
was
fooling
me
anywho
interesting
looking
beer
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
taste
poured
into
a
hebrew
small
shaker
pint
pours
a
cherry
red
amber
with
an
appropriate
one
finger
light
pink
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
subdued
aroma
of
light
biscuit
malt
fruit
and
nonidentifiable
vegetables
flavor
is
bready
malt
grassy
hops
dark
and
light
fruit
finishing
spicy
with
a
sharp
and
somewhat
acrid
hop
bitterness
an
unusually
flavored
lager
but
no
identifiable
ingredient
for
the
oddness
medium
bodied
odd
but
certainly
fun
to
drink
it
lives
up
to
its
presentation
and
label
art
the
finish
is
a
bit
unbalanced
o
it
seems
that
this
beer
would
go
well
with
meats
because
it
is
a
little
malty
and
has
some
spices
and
dryness
to
cut
through
the
food
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
just
not
a
good
beer
the
whole
gimmick
is
the
label
art
and
the
color
of
the
beer
inside
a
failure
of
a
beer
o
disappointed
this
is
my
first
beer
from
coney
island
i
have
heard
positive
reviews
of
the
brewery
but
this
beer
is
a
gimmick
not
amused
for
a
seasonal
red
lager
freaktoberfest
misses
crisp
clean
flavors
of
munich
malts
while
showcasing
a
rich
lager
yeast
if
the
style
is
brewed
for
amusement
to
please
circus
folk
this
is
spot
on
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
no
bottle
datingbut
apparently
from
last
year
pours
lightly
hazy
reddish
copper
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
dense
light
khaki
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lasts
good
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
pear
apple
raisin
caramel
toast
molasses
biscuit
nuttiness
and
light
earthiness
pretty
nice
aromas
with
good
strength
and
balance
taste
of
caramel
pear
raisin
toast
toffee
apple
molasses
biscuit
earth
and
light
herbal
spiciness
lingering
notes
of
caramel
pear
raisin
toast
molasses
biscuit
earth
and
light
herbal
spiciness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
nice
balance
and
robustness
of
flavors
almost
zero
cloying
sweetness
present
on
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
creamy
and
fairly
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
almost
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
oktoberfest
style
nice
balance
and
robustness
of
flavors
very
smooth
to
drink
this
is
fairly
on
par
with
the
style
as
well
definitely
an
enjoyable
offering
pretty
thin
mouthfeel
and
it
actually
doesnt
hide
the
booze
very
well
this
is
a
one
and
done
beer
for
me
im
afraid
overall
im
never
buying
a
coney
island
beer
again
o
fun
beer
for
halloween
but
not
one
that
stands
out
perfect
to
spice
up
a
party
with
a
good
and
flavorful
beer
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
tasty
beer
gimmick
or
no
gimmick
would
be
a
great
choice
for
a
halloween
party
or
similar
occasion
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
clear
dark
red
with
a
thick
moderately
quickly
dissipating
pink
head
i
detect
a
moderate
amount
of
tiny
bubbles
visible
in
the
beer
it
definitely
looks
gimmicky
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
i
pick
up
some
bready
and
some
caramel
malts
in
the
aroma
there
are
some
earthy
and
floral
hops
theres
some
mild
fruity
aroma
which
might
explain
the
color
the
taste
definitely
excites
more
than
the
nose
as
the
hops
come
through
pretty
well
there
are
earthy
floral
and
piney
hop
notes
that
are
very
forward
there
is
a
solid
bready
and
caramel
malt
backbone
theres
some
citrus
and
some
mild
cherry
notes
the
hop
bitterness
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
with
solid
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
beer
despite
the
gimmick
it
would
inspire
some
conversation
if
consumed
at
a
halloween
party
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
yields
a
ruby
garnet
with
a
thin
pinkish
frothy
head
on
top
looks
like
cranberry
ginger
ale
the
nose
is
sweet
with
notes
of
strawberry
pale
fruit
quality
but
closes
out
with
a
musty
veggie
scent
crisp
mouth
good
carbonation
finishes
clean
the
musty
character
carries
over
to
the
flavor
as
there
is
a
dank
old
flavor
that
pervades
this
beer
flavors
of
beets
cherry
medicine
mild
fruits
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
back
end
this
beer
sure
was
an
oddity
not
sure
i
would
venture
here
again
as
i
really
didnt
care
for
the
medicinal
quality
of
this
one
but
then
again
it
wasnt
so
horrendous
that
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
if
offered
too
far
out
there
from
my
favorite
true
fallbeers
overall
this
beer
is
really
all
about
the
gimmick
with
the
red
color
and
the
abv
and
is
honestly
pretty
unimpressive
nothing
offensive
however
and
an
ok
seasonal
overall
a
pretty
interesting
and
solid
brew
a
nice
mix
of
herbal
hops
and
malts
this
is
an
all
around
great
beer
damn
shame
its
a
seasonal
ive
had
it
for
the
past
45
years
and
always
look
forward
to
it
the
feel
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
as
its
lightly
crisp
but
gets
pretty
lush
as
it
rolls
on
the
tongue
the
body
is
pretty
much
even
medium
leaning
slightly
toward
lighter
the
creamy
smoothness
goes
into
the
finish
while
the
crispness
though
light
doesnt
back
off
either
o
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
something
id
pick
up
again
very
low
drinkability
a
one
and
done
type
i
feel
like
the
beer
is
just
too
busy
all
around
too
many
flavors
flying
around
to
enjoy
it
but
a
for
creativity
on
this
one
love
the
6
66
indeed
overall
a
great
alternative
in
this
season
blood
red
unique
taste
drinkable
tough
time
of
the
year
to
compete
in
beers
with
more
fruit
of
a
flavor
o
good
beer
but
will
wear
out
its
welcome
pretty
quick
the
four
pack
is
probably
by
design
because
after
the
second
beer
is
starts
to
become
less
fun
and
more
disfunctional
drinkability
is
decent
i
can
drink
1
to
1
5
bottles
until
it
really
becomes
a
chore
to
drink
the
other
two
bottles
out
of
the
4
pack
will
be
shared
with
friends
mouthfeel
is
fine
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
a
little
prickly
too
sweet
in
a
weird
way
which
interferes
with
the
drinkability
for
sure
only
bought
a
bottle
of
this
and
im
glad
for
it
o
not
too
crazy
bout
this
stuff
at
all
but
im
not
hatin
on
it
looking
back
it
doesnt
bother
me
that
i
spent
2
29
on
it
worth
it
id
say
as
its
an
experience
to
try
neither
satisfied
nor
unsatisfied
i
like
shmaltz
so
ill
try
anything
they
put
out
overall
not
a
terrible
brew
but
a
little
too
gimmicky
for
my
tastes
overall
a
unique
twist
on
the
amberred
lager
by
coney
island
this
is
my
first
sampling
by
them
and
i
quite
enjoy
this
one
the
blackcurrant
and
citrus
flavours
are
very
nice
and
refreshing
for
those
who
are
adventurous
this
is
worth
a
try
d
i
feel
kind
of
bad
due
to
this
review
being
based
off
a
bottle
terribly
outdated
but
i
cant
fathom
this
could
be
an
enjoyable
brew
at
any
point
in
its
life
time
the
sad
part
is
after
i
choke
down
this
4
pack
i
know
i
have
to
revisit
this
one
next
fall
and
give
it
a
fair
trial
o
there
is
a
lot
wrong
with
this
alcohol
tasted
at
only
6
66
way
too
stickysweet
too
many
conflicting
flavors
and
demonic
art
work
on
the
bottle
looking
at
me
make
sure
you
wash
off
your
lips
because
it
turns
them
red
moreys
bottom
line
i
could
do
without
the
food
coloring
and
the
6
66
alcohol
but
i
actually
kind
of
enjoy
the
sour
flavor
its
not
overwhelming
just
enough
a
fun
halloweenfall
beer
this
was
given
to
me
in
a
mixed
6
for
christmas
glad
that
i
got
to
try
it
overall
this
is
one
weirdass
beer
any
beer
with
a
noticeable
amount
of
rye
in
it
can
be
really
hit
or
miss
for
me
this
one
was
more
of
a
miss
o
a
little
weird
but
the
flavors
are
not
bad
i
dont
like
sweeter
beers
so
i
wouldnt
necessarily
try
again
but
worth
the
try
o
i
originally
bought
this
bear
thinking
it
was
an
octoberfest
not
really
what
i
was
looking
for
but
glad
that
i
tried
it
a
great
looking
and
fine
tasting
red
recommended
overall
bloody
good
brew
wouldnt
drink
all
year
but
its
a
fun
seasonal
perfect
for
a
halloween
party
schmaltz
is
right
up
there
with
stone
for
creative
labels
this
was
not
a
good
experience
unfortunately
this
will
have
to
be
a
drain
pour
i
havent
experienced
that
in
months
o
a
fun
and
unique
take
not
the
tastiest
amber
or
oktoberfest
or
whatever
its
supposed
to
be
but
points
for
doing
their
own
thing
o
drainpour
strictly
a
novelty
for
the
halloween
season
try
a
single
bottle
before
you
buy
more
because
10
for
a
4pk
isnt
cheap
and
this
beer
is
definitely
not
worth
that
price
it
sure
looks
the
part
for
a
halloween
beer
when
they
say
bloodred
they
arent
kidding
i
wasnt
aware
that
blood
was
supposed
to
be
so
sweet
though
this
lager
smells
very
sweet
and
tastes
the
part
too
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
but
overall
this
is
just
too
sweet
to
be
a
regular
its
a
nice
novelty
for
the
season
but
i
wouldnt
get
more
than
a
single
o
okay
to
drink
for
halloween
but
i
definitely
dont
plan
on
having
this
again
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
traditional
brew
very
tasty
and
refreshingly
different
o
i
guess
i
hadnt
read
the
bottle
before
i
poured
because
i
had
no
idea
it
would
be
blood
red
then
i
read
this
6
malts
6
hops
6
66
alc
blood
red
lager
nice
touch
i
think
this
beer
is
perfect
for
a
halloween
party
it
has
an
exceptionally
sinister
presentation
and
is
still
a
really
tasty
beer
to
sip
there
simply
wasnt
enough
going
on
here
to
make
me
interested
besides
the
freakish
color
fairly
interesting
and
decent
brew
not
stellar
but
worth
trying
at
least
once
for
the
novelty
and
presentation
would
be
a
fun
beer
to
break
out
at
a
halloween
party
a
decent
if
not
slightly
bitter
lager
this
is
enjoyable
enough
as
a
freak
show
but
not
the
kind
of
brew
youd
want
to
drink
every
day
the
biggest
attraction
of
this
beer
sad
to
say
is
the
sizzle
the
crazy
cool
label
the
bloodred
brew
dyed
ive
heard
with
beets
and
the
awsome
cap
second
only
to
ayingers
oktoberfest
label
hmm
since
beer
of
course
isnt
bought
based
upon
the
label
cap
or
color
this
is
more
of
a
party
beer
not
a
serious
consumption
beer
o
an
interesting
experience
if
the
pour
would
have
been
bolder
and
hadnt
overflowed
i
might
have
giving
the
appearance
a
5
at
first
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
this
for
fall
but
soon
realized
theres
no
other
way
id
have
it
its
light
and
heavy
simple
yet
complex
its
definitely
a
halloween
inspired
beer
just
like
everything
else
they
do
try
it
and
dont
be
afraid
to
buy
a
six
pack
i
would
however
its
unavailable
in
my
area
rip
steve
jobs
cheers
o
this
would
be
a
nice
tailgating
brew
with
a
splash
of
vodka
interesting
all
over
the
board
hard
to
rate
drinking
many
of
these
would
produce
a
killer
hangover
overall
this
is
certainly
a
beer
that
lives
up
to
its
name
being
a
wild
freakshow
of
a
beverage
that
is
sure
to
take
you
on
a
wild
ride
i
cant
say
the
result
is
good
cheers
o
strange
looking
but
not
too
bad
overall
i
like
the
strong
carbonation
and
medium
hops
finish
bought
on
recommendation
of
store
clerk
and
i
liked
the
label
o
i
get
that
its
supposed
to
be
a
different
beer
different
is
good
if
the
quality
backs
it
up
this
one
did
not
do
it
for
me
probably
wouldnt
drink
again
unless
it
was
my
only
option
o
this
is
simply
not
a
very
appetizing
beer
it
has
some
good
qualities
but
it
misses
the
mark
overall
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
it
was
a
chore
to
drink
the
few
ounces
i
did
not
my
kind
of
beer
i
guess
this
beer
gushed
all
over
my
sink
when
i
opened
it
pours
a
hazy
cranberry
red
with
a
1
inch
light
red
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
foamy
patterns
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
a
very
interesting
looking
beer
to
say
the
least
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
some
berry
and
some
tomato
juice
taste
is
of
malt
and
bitter
chemicals
there
is
a
very
slight
fruitvegetable
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
on
paper
but
in
reality
its
pretty
gross
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
nice
beer
the
appearance
is
intriguing
and
the
taste
is
surprisingly
complex
im
having
a
hard
time
figuring
out
how
they
got
the
beer
such
a
ruby
red
without
affecting
the
flavor
profile
freaky
to
say
the
least
worth
checking
out
o
well
this
is
a
weird
looking
beer
and
of
course
it
is
gimmicky
but
its
also
really
tasty
i
like
this
stuff
mouthfeel
it
is
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
smell
is
rather
boring
some
malt
and
barley
with
little
to
no
hops
taste
is
rather
bland
as
well
for
something
deemed
feaktoberfest
this
is
an
incredibly
timid
beer
o
picked
this
one
up
blind
i
guess
by
the
name
and
the
season
it
would
be
some
sort
of
marzen
nope
not
even
close
and
not
very
impressed
overall
not
bad
but
not
anywhere
close
to
what
i
was
expecting
for
the
style
too
bitter
too
sweet
too
much
caramel
and
reddish
malts
pours
a
bright
red
with
a
pink
head
if
i
didnt
know
what
it
was
i
would
say
it
looked
like
a
kriek
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leave
behind
some
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
malty
cereal
grain
aromas
the
smell
reminds
me
of
when
i
brew
beer
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
after
a
toasty
malt
flavor
on
the
palate
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
hoppy
brown
ale
if
it
werent
for
the
color
not
my
favorite
offering
from
this
brewery
but
not
bad
interesting
malt
and
hops
are
a
little
out
of
whack
i
can
appreciate
the
novelty
though
and
i
applaud
shmaltz
especially
the
color
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
the
head
is
an
inch
and
a
half
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
leaving
nice
sticky
lacing
the
taste
and
aroma
are
of
a
generic
caramel
malt
character
that
can
be
found
in
many
other
badboring
beers
there
is
no
depth
in
either
the
flavor
or
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
inappropriately
low
carbonation
and
a
sticky
texture
overall
this
is
a
bad
beer
that
i
will
not
drink
again
overall
i
must
say
how
much
i
was
surprised
by
this
i
was
talked
into
this
by
the
guy
at
the
bottle
shop
when
i
got
home
i
read
the
reviews
and
was
pissed
that
i
was
talked
into
a
shitty
beer
that
was
six
or
seven
months
ago
i
finally
cracked
it
tonight
and
didnt
think
is
was
bad
at
all
maybe
time
did
this
one
good
a
must
check
out
for
the
morbid
halloween
crowd
it
doesnt
taste
as
complex
as
the
6
malts
and
6
hops
would
expect
you
to
believe
but
its
a
fun
unique
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
the
color
of
this
beer
is
frightfully
red
i
am
sure
hoping
that
they
used
beets
in
the
mash
instead
of
food
coloring
white
thin
head
disappears
into
pink
clouding
smell
is
cloyingly
sweet
maltiness
and
a
slight
chemical
tinge
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
very
solidly
malty
and
slightly
grainy
not
the
worst
beer
if
you
get
past
the
smell
and
appearance
a
surprise
cap
to
this
most
recent
bliss
tasting
it
pours
a
mostly
clear
dark
pink
lemonade
topped
by
a
finger
of
pinkwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
slightly
toasted
caramel
grapefruit
rind
and
grass
the
taste
focuses
on
the
fruitier
notes
including
in
the
back
a
lingering
mystery
fruit
that
i
just
cannot
put
my
finger
on
this
concoction
while
not
necessarily
offensive
does
not
sit
very
well
on
my
tongue
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
completely
unappealing
beer
even
if
theres
nothing
outright
terrible
about
it
boo
this
stuff
it
is
a
kind
of
creamy
robust
lager
it
is
smooth
and
well
balanced
there
is
some
kind
of
fruit
taste
but
not
from
yeast
the
color
is
a
crazy
red
including
the
head
hey
im
not
drinking
beer
im
drinking
pop
red
pop
not
really
enough
going
on
here
to
justify
the
price
unless
novelty
is
worth
a
big
premium
halloween
and
you
want
to
drink
something
unique
what
the
fuck
is
this
i
dont
appreciate
it
when
beers
are
given
names
that
make
them
sound
like
a
different
style
than
they
actually
are
i
bought
this
thinking
it
was
an
oktoberfest
and
it
came
out
looking
like
someone
bottled
a
bad
day
at
the
hospital
upon
further
reviewing
my
opinion
is
slightly
increasing
the
aroma
is
very
light
with
malts
the
taste
has
some
sour
malts
and
maybe
some
fruit
but
that
could
just
be
my
eyes
forcing
a
taste
association
it
has
a
bit
of
a
twang
and
makes
the
center
of
my
tongue
tingle
will
i
get
this
again
not
likely
o
this
was
definitely
an
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
just
because
the
appearance
is
shocking
and
for
most
beer
drinkers
it
probably
sets
up
failure
for
the
rest
of
the
beer
as
for
the
taste
it
was
pretty
good
until
the
aftertaste
becomes
to
sour
like
a
lingering
metallic
lemon
or
lime
flavor
that
seems
to
stick
to
the
roof
of
your
mouth
o
the
only
thing
freaky
about
this
beer
is
that
its
freakishly
gross
pretty
beer
but
that
just
doesnt
cut
it
o
i
cant
say
that
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
particular
offering
it
had
some
odd
flavours
and
just
wasnt
anything
i
was
a
big
fan
of
certainly
festive
and
would
be
suitable
for
a
halloween
party
but
just
didnt
offer
the
flavours
i
was
hoping
for
d
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
taste
is
good
this
beer
is
very
interesting
and
the
flavor
never
got
boring
i
think
that
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
i
would
try
it
again
mouthfeel
drinkability
a
very
musty
light
bodied
and
artificial
tasting
beverage
this
beer
is
definitely
one
freak
that
will
remain
an
outcast
to
me
with
respect
to
shmaltz
i
did
not
like
this
beer
at
all
drinkability
normally
i
really
like
beers
that
exemplify
a
given
style
exceptionally
well
however
i
like
this
beer
for
the
exact
opposite
reason
it
is
a
fullflavored
lager
that
really
defies
categorization
ba
calls
it
an
american
amberred
lager
and
it
certainly
is
red
but
it
is
truly
unlike
any
other
amber
lager
ive
ever
had
this
beer
is
highly
recommended
if
for
no
other
reason
than
it
will
bend
your
preconceived
notions
of
amber
lagers
a
true
freak
in
all
the
best
ways
wow
i
cant
believe
the
cherry
red
color
this
beer
poured
out
of
the
bottle
i
was
not
expecting
that
it
had
an
average
amount
of
fluffy
pink
head
on
it
smell
is
not
too
great
taste
is
alright
but
the
aftertaste
is
not
so
great
bitter
but
a
little
off
average
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
id
try
it
again
but
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
them
drinkability
is
also
good
easy
to
put
a
few
down
in
one
sitting
i
highly
enjoyed
this
beer
perhaps
it
just
needs
some
time
in
the
bottle
to
take
on
some
additional
positive
characteristics
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
bitterness
and
fruitiness
that
is
rather
unpleasant
it
makes
me
think
im
being
force
fed
noble
hops
drizzled
with
artificial
cherry
syrup
with
artificial
sweeteners
theres
a
grainy
husky
tannin
character
thats
harsh
and
unpleasant
bitter
on
the
finish
with
a
mix
of
grain
and
hops
this
is
offensive
and
a
waste
of
my
time
and
money
i
am
going
against
the
tide
here
and
just
cannot
stand
this
beer
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
an
odd
colored
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
imagine
my
surprise
unsuspecting
victim
that
i
was
since
i
bought
the
beer
because
the
name
seemed
cool
and
i
wanted
to
be
daring
with
shmaltz
when
the
pour
was
a
candy
apple
red
with
a
massive
pick
fizzyfoamy
head
im
having
flashbacks
to
romulan
ale
and
magic
hat
wacko
which
are
two
of
my
most
hated
experiences
in
the
last
year
still
ill
give
this
one
a
shot
aromas
are
fairly
weak
a
bit
of
dough
light
brown
sugar
and
some
apple
or
fruit
of
some
sort
its
hard
though
when
your
eyes
are
assaulted
at
every
turn
flavor
is
pretty
noneventful
a
bit
of
an
oktoberfest
boozy
graininess
to
it
some
caramel
and
a
funkiness
that
might
be
the
dye
or
whatever
a
tingly
alcohol
presence
throughout
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
not
a
favorite
beer
at
all
this
is
a
nice
nutral
drink
here
the
whole
crazy
halloween
thing
plays
welli
had
a
growler
this
for
halloween
and
drank
from
a
trumer
pils
beaker
and
thought
it
was
awesome
love
the
abv
sweet
but
easydrinking
found
this
brew
to
be
pretty
enjoyable
and
am
a
little
surprised
by
the
mostly
lackluster
reviews
deep
blood
red
color
with
a
pale
red
thin
head
that
dissapates
quickly
i
was
suprised
this
thing
is
seriously
red
definitely
fits
what
the
brewers
were
aiming
for
pretty
clear
a
little
haze
and
bubbles
but
mostly
clear
smells
faintly
of
some
fruity
hops
nothing
is
easy
to
pick
out
but
id
guess
its
a
pretty
good
mix
of
things
it
tastes
average
not
my
favorite
red
lager
by
a
long
shot
but
i
think
its
supposed
to
be
different
so
ill
judge
it
on
its
own
its
got
a
sweet
malty
smooth
finish
that
ends
in
a
very
quick
bitter
finish
and
an
about
2
second
aftertaste
its
different
medium
carbonation
and
light
bodied
its
ok
i
mean
its
different
i
thought
going
in
it
was
an
octoberfest
then
saw
it
was
a
redamber
and
dont
really
agree
its
unique
the
only
time
id
buy
a
sixpack
would
be
around
halloween
for
a
party
or
something
bc
it
looks
pretty
awesome
poured
to
about
a
half
inch
head
head
was
pink
in
color
brew
itself
was
red
or
blood
in
color
head
didnt
hang
around
for
very
long
but
did
leave
a
little
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smelled
of
malt
bread
and
a
little
alcohol
tasted
of
maltbreadand
a
little
alcohol
had
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
carbonation
i
thought
was
right
i
got
this
bottle
from
a
friend
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
taste
it
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
it
i
did
like
the
looks
of
the
bottle
sometimes
i
strongly
dislike
a
beer
for
promising
something
good
with
the
smell
then
underdelivering
this
beer
makes
good
on
the
halfhearted
promise
of
its
unpleasant
aroma
d
not
a
huge
red
beer
fan
and
this
is
most
assuredly
one
of
the
strangest
beers
i
have
ever
tried
worth
trying
once
especially
if
you
are
a
redamber
beer
fan
pours
a
bright
reddish
color
perhaps
a
very
dark
pink
whatever
nose
is
somewhat
muted
though
some
faint
hoppy
aromas
are
noted
on
the
palate
is
more
hop
presence
than
what
i
thought
there
would
be
for
an
octoberfest
with
some
toasty
malt
grain
flavors
too
finishes
toasty
with
a
hop
presence
as
well
drinkability
definitely
not
the
usual
lager
taste
but
crisp
and
tasty
i
could
see
myself
sitting
and
having
a
few
of
these
around
the
bar
d
im
gonna
go
ahead
and
discard
this
brew
the
flavor
is
odd
almost
pushing
the
boundaries
of
being
off
its
not
awful
but
the
only
place
i
can
see
this
beer
making
another
appearance
in
my
life
would
be
at
a
halloween
party
where
it
would
fit
right
in
with
the
bmc
crowd
perfectly
drinkability
is
very
average
for
me
i
really
think
their
marketing
here
is
in
the
packaging
making
it
kind
of
a
gimmick
beer
the
beer
itself
could
never
live
up
the
intense
packaging
creation
that
they
brewed
up
i
could
see
people
bringing
this
to
a
fall
party
to
show
off
the
box
and
the
red
color
of
the
beer
but
overall
its
important
qualities
are
all
just
very
average
its
pretty
average
i
suppose
i
can
see
why
it
is
classified
as
an
amber
as
opposed
to
an
oktoberfest
even
then
while
drinkable
it
isnt
remarkable
something
different
and
decent
in
all
areas
but
flavor
unfortunately
thats
a
very
important
area
when
it
comes
too
enjoying
beer
my
imagination
seems
driven
to
conjure
up
cough
syrup
analogies
which
arent
entirely
apt
overall
an
underwhelming
red
lager
the
overlyevident
shtick
adding
nothing
beyond
saleability
for
upcoming
halloween
parties
i
dunno
foodcolouring
aside
this
is
a
fairly
mediocre
red
ale
or
oktoberfest
whichever
way
you
wish
to
slice
it
it
lacks
cohesion
as
the
flavour
goes
off
in
seperate
directions
and
although
it
gets
a
bit
intense
in
parts
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
reward
for
the
effort
i
call
gimmick
on
this
one
i
wouldnt
recomend
this
brew
this
went
down
relatively
easy
and
the
novelty
of
a
6
66
how
beastly
abv
like
the
rest
of
this
beer
wore
a
bit
thin
after
a
while
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
unlike
the
freaks
at
coney
island
im
not
gonna
down
one
of
these
in
5
seconds
as
crazy
as
it
sounds
theres
nothing
else
like
it
and
if
for
no
other
reason
this
beer
deserves
to
be
tried
by
all
since
itll
challenge
the
notion
of
what
constitutes
and
american
amber
as
much
as
i
was
just
blah
about
this
i
am
looking
forward
to
having
the
rest
of
the
bottles
that
i
bought
just
to
see
if
its
any
different
the
second
time
around
poured
from
bottle
into
wtf
this
beer
is
bright
red
with
a
pink
head
and
slight
lacing
definitley
not
ready
for
that
i
was
expecting
a
typical
marzen
i
give
it
a
5
for
novelty
alone
but
the
color
is
actually
pretty
amazing
smell
is
sweet
cherries
fruity
malts
some
hops
and
fruity
yeast
taste
is
sweet
fruits
with
a
good
hop
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
red
rope
licorice
very
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
actually
very
drinkable
the
flavors
go
well
together
and
create
a
very
unique
lager
a
little
pricey
but
i
have
to
say
the
novelty
of
this
beer
6
66
abv
ha
and
the
above
average
taste
have
won
me
over
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
this
is
a
solid
beer
its
a
very
interesting
one
to
say
the
least
i
have
to
admit
that
i
was
a
bit
sucked
in
by
the
labeling
this
is
not
an
oktoberfest
dpretty
rough
around
the
edges
actually
and
not
very
pleasant
to
drink
i
had
a
sixteen
ounce
glass
of
this
at
the
amsterdam
ale
house
on
manhattans
upper
west
side
i
expected
it
to
be
a
marzen
but
know
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
that
it
wouldnt
be
it
was
very
dark
almost
black
with
a
dark
brown
head
carbonation
is
light
aroma
and
flavor
are
very
malty
and
actually
a
little
sweet
i
didnt
really
like
it
but
its
worth
trying
strange
looking
pour
to
me
head
which
disappated
quickly
was
a
strawberry
color
and
the
beer
itself
almost
looks
as
if
food
coloring
were
added
almost
like
a
dark
pink
lemonade
smells
of
crisp
smooth
malts
very
pleasant
smelling
medium
bodied
a
bit
over
carbonated
a
burst
of
flavors
on
the
initial
sip
i
cannot
figure
this
one
out
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
plus
kinda
yeasty
a
bit
unpleasant
and
syrupy
still
having
trouble
identifying
anything
but
cough
syrup
and
a
lingering
bitterness
not
something
i
would
go
for
again
but
worth
a
try
definitely
different
than
any
other
beer
ive
ever
tried
strangely
though
very
nice
brew
by
shmaltz
drinkability
id
love
to
try
more
of
this
beer
although
the
bitterness
is
bit
beyond
my
general
tastes
very
cool
brew
d
i
liken
this
beer
to
this
situation
you
witness
a
man
in
a
banana
suit
arguing
at
the
counter
of
a
deli
while
an
elderly
woman
beats
him
with
a
cane
you
go
away
thinking
did
that
just
happen
if
you
like
feeling
like
you
witnessed
or
ingested
something
beyond
explanation
this
ones
for
you
drinkability
is
not
bad
decent
beer
just
doesnt
look
really
appealing
in
the
glass
this
thing
was
just
off
novelty
aside
6
66
abv
i
get
it
its
not
making
me
laugh
but
i
get
it
theres
nothing
right
and
just
about
this
thing
im
afraid
this
will
take
up
good
tap
space
for
a
long
time
please
be
only
a
sixth
keg
notes
its
a
little
bit
of
a
gimmicky
beer
and
not
a
true
oktoberfest
but
its
still
a
decent
and
enjoyable
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
red
almost
purple
color
with
a
thick
frothy
pink
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
really
doesnt
have
much
of
an
aroma
at
all
its
malty
with
a
pale
munich
malt
aroma
its
sweet
with
a
touch
of
hops
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
unique
flavor
thats
sweet
with
pale
and
munich
malts
yet
bitter
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
unique
beer
but
nothing
id
seek
out
again
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
purple
character
of
this
beer
it
takes
away
from
the
taste
and
aroma
but
does
add
something
to
the
appearance
d
not
a
chance
would
i
have
this
again
truthfully
i
got
more
enjoyment
from
pizza
beer
in
a
sense
that
it
at
least
it
had
flavor
i
even
overpaid
for
it
getting
a
bottle
for
a
whopping
3
25
and
to
think
i
could
have
had
a
real
oktoberfest
i
have
no
idea
why
the
beer
bros
enjoyed
this
so
much
or
why
they
still
make
it
but
its
a
pretty
sub
par
beer
that
only
get
sales
from
being
weird
pass
d
only
because
it
is
a
halloween
fall
color
and
its
intrigue
hits
with
such
force
yes
definitly
a
drinker
drinkability
solid
amber
but
for
the
money
i
would
buy
brooklyn
lager
d
one
was
enough
appears
a
deep
blood
red
orange
juice
accent
a
pink
tingedhead
forms
thick
above
the
body
this
is
a
unique
looking
brew
aroma
has
tart
fruit
smells
blended
with
a
unique
cherry
skin
earthy
quality
i
dont
know
what
fruits
created
this
freaky
lager
but
its
interesting
aroma
has
a
faint
citrus
quality
with
herbal
hops
in
the
background
now
lets
taste
this
amazingly
different
brew
earthy
minty
quality
brings
hops
and
dry
bitter
slightly
sweet
malt
tones
like
an
okotberfest
with
a
bit
more
earthiness
mouthfeel
is
interesting
with
a
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
flowing
through
each
sip
drinkability
overall
is
a
bit
rough
i
dont
know
about
this
style
or
beer
why
the
color
why
the
flavors
its
a
bit
harsh
in
every
regard
gimmicky
or
good
both
gotta
hand
it
to
shmaltz
their
marketing
is
simply
awesome
this
is
a
fun
unique
and
tasty
lagerthats
all
that
really
matters
subtle
and
thin
punchy
hop
aromas
are
the
first
thing
i
notice
a
deep
bloodred
liquid
pours
from
the
bottle
into
the
glass
goblet
healthy
carbonation
creates
a
large
fluffy
head
that
is
a
combination
of
tan
and
cherry
a
crisp
lager
undertone
sets
the
tone
for
an
extra
bitter
multiple
hop
profile
some
fruity
notes
on
the
back
end
reminds
me
of
cranberry
while
a
downward
sour
bitterness
layers
the
crunch
of
the
malt
and
wheat
the
edgy
bitterness
of
the
hops
in
collaboration
with
some
wild
microcarbonation
rough
up
an
otherwise
smooth
mouth
feel
its
an
ok
brew
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
cant
help
but
say
i
feel
ripped
off
overly
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
by
the
end
the
alcohol
becomes
prominent
in
the
flavor
profile
not
to
mention
the
weird
color
wish
they
mentioned
dye
on
thre
label
tried
to
give
the
beer
some
character
with
the
label
but
only
managed
to
give
it
a
wierd
factor
basically
its
a
good
beer
reddishorange
in
color
and
it
carries
the
same
mouthfeel
as
most
other
coney
island
varieties
it
is
however
not
as
good
as
the
white
lager
or
the
basic
lager
that
they
brew
i
would
say
that
its
worth
a
try
but
buy
a
single
before
you
buy
a
case
d
not
to
flavorfull
overall
around
but
a
good
session
beer
i
got
say
the
color
of
the
beer
is
intresting
md
seems
well
balanced
good
beer
for
what
it
is
promoting
somewhat
gimmicky
i
like
a
lot
of
their
other
beers
this
is
just
a
one
time
beer
d
got
this
thinking
i
would
get
a
unigue
marzen
but
that
wasnt
the
case
at
all
dissapointingly
flat
but
refreshingly
crisp
when
all
the
fruit
aspects
are
taken
into
consideration
not
a
beer
i
will
buy
again
pretty
forgetable
2
55
great
finish
with
all
of
beer
qualities
layered
and
coming
through
crazy
looking
but
tastes
very
good
d
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
let
down
for
me
after
seeing
the
crazy
looking
guy
on
the
bottle
the
freakish
name
and
strange
color
i
was
expecting
big
flavors
but
once
you
get
past
the
packaging
and
appearance
its
pretty
mundane
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
one
d
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
enjoy
the
wierdness
and
i
could
handle
this
on
a
regular
basis
as
it
tastes
clean
and
has
a
nice
amount
of
hop
flavor
wout
overdoing
it
worth
a
try
since
it
isnt
just
lager
w
food
coloring
a
la
magic
hat
wacko
drinkability
a
curious
novelty
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
to
which
i
would
return
d
balance
is
a
little
off
hop
character
is
incomplete
and
doesnt
pair
greatly
with
malts
rokken
like
dokken
think
way
outside
of
the
box
for
a
fall
seasonal
not
an
ofest
and
there
are
enough
pumpkin
spiced
brews
out
there
make
this
your
alt
beer
for
the
fall
this
bomber
pours
a
clear
golden
cranberry
color
with
a
decent
berry
colored
head
with
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
raspberry
cider
very
firm
and
likeable
the
taste
is
a
fair
translation
of
the
aroma
with
plenty
of
malt
and
raspberry
overtones
and
root
sharpness
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
near
midbody
feel
a
bit
of
dr
pepper
herbal
quality
very
decent
version
of
the
style
nice
and
drinkable
enough
blood
red
with
a
big
airy
pink
cotton
candy
head
that
leaves
scraps
of
pink
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
on
this
one
is
kind
of
funky
a
faint
mustiness
permeates
the
otherwise
mild
toasted
grain
aroma
this
beer
is
okay
but
just
a
little
off
the
mark
to
my
taste
buds
maybe
oxidation
but
halloween
was
less
than
two
weeks
ago
maybe
its
just
a
case
of
too
much
going
on
with
the
six
hops
and
six
malts
medium
light
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
this
beer
gets
a
little
better
as
it
goes
i
think
the
appearance
plays
mind
games
with
my
taste
buds
a
strange
offering
that
is
not
really
on
par
with
other
schmaltz
beers
mouthfeeldrinkability
just
a
moderate
to
light
average
texture
that
just
keeps
the
action
happening
a
bit
busy
in
terms
of
flavor
to
session
or
drink
more
that
one
d
very
much
of
novelty
in
my
book
the
look
is
certainly
reminiscent
of
a
cherry
lambic
for
whatever
thats
worth
the
beers
harsh
metal
flavors
really
detracted
from
the
experience
kind
of
fun
as
a
one
time
experience
but
not
worth
a
revisit
notes
it
states
clearly
that
this
is
not
a
n
oktoberfest
but
a
freaktoberfest
and
should
be
taken
as
such
the
brew
is
a
visual
shocker
at
least
at
first
and
it
sure
makes
for
an
eccentric
social
offering
there
resides
its
biggest
asset
having
said
that
it
is
not
half
as
bad
or
even
as
mediocre
as
one
would
be
led
to
believe
it
is
a
rather
wacky
brew
but
fairly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
it
seems
to
do
rather
well
what
it
sets
itself
to
do
after
buying
this
for
the
first
time
i
will
remember
to
only
drink
this
on
the
right
occasion
for
fear
that
the
other
beer
dudes
think
im
drinking
sangria
to
my
surprise
this
marzen
poured
blood
orange
how
cool
although
it
is
fruity
in
apperance
you
do
not
pick
that
up
on
the
nose
or
in
the
flavor
how
cool
its
actually
really
hard
to
pick
up
the
smell
so
i
had
to
get
down
so
close
i
got
some
foam
on
my
nose
its
kind
of
funny
how
the
taste
is
nothing
like
what
you
expect
but
a
good
surprise
none
the
less
hoppier
than
most
marzens
i
graded
this
beer
not
just
for
what
it
is
but
what
it
stands
for
freakishness
this
drink
really
throws
the
senses
off
as
to
leave
you
pondering
all
night
and
its
a
great
halloween
beer
for
your
party
taste
is
overly
hoppy
for
the
style
and
mineraly
to
boot
im
going
to
cut
this
review
short
it
is
somewhat
like
grabbing
the
wrong
glass
and
drinking
orange
juice
when
you
expect
milk
the
oj
might
be
great
but
convincing
your
senses
of
that
after
the
fact
is
next
to
impossible
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
wont
be
giving
this
one
another
go
anytime
soon
a
big
time
disappointment
boo
pretty
sweet
but
not
as
much
or
as
watered
down
as
i
expected
with
a
nice
earthy
floral
hop
presence
that
lingers
throughout
slightly
roasted
malt
body
with
a
bit
of
nut
and
fall
spice
abv
wel
masked
not
really
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
rather
its
just
a
goofy
gimmick
that
isnt
too
terrible
drinkability
meh
this
is
a
total
gimic
its
not
a
bad
lager
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
get
it
its
a
gimmick
the
label
comes
out
and
says
it
its
funny
6
66
alcohol
ha
ha
ha
i
get
it
d
didnt
even
want
to
finish
what
was
in
my
tasting
glass
i
made
sure
to
wash
it
out
before
drinking
anything
else
not
a
fan
drinkability
is
ok
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
its
not
something
id
regularly
drink
if
your
looking
for
a
strange
novelty
beer
than
this
would
be
the
one
for
you
drinkability
too
out
there
for
me
i
feel
like
the
style
was
somewhat
ignored
i
wouldnt
care
for
another
especially
for
the
price
in
retrospect
if
you
like
mineral
water
spiked
with
bitterness
like
tonic
water
or
italian
bitters
this
is
for
you
had
to
donate
the
rest
of
the
22oz
bottle
to
someone
else
from
the
label
in
this
beer
is
a
joke
the
only
freaky
part
of
this
beer
is
the
appearance
and
it
is
definitely
not
an
octoberfest
too
bad
that
the
flavor
doesnt
live
up
to
the
name
given
the
beer
i
would
call
this
a
freakeye
lager
which
is
an
average
beer
drinkability
this
was
fun
to
open
and
get
the
oohs
and
ahs
from
my
buddys
but
after
i
finished
it
and
the
excitement
wore
off
this
was
just
a
bad
novelty
beer
dtaste
is
good
not
overwhelmingly
sweet
drinkable
though
not
quite
sessionable
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
decent
representation
of
style
it
might
be
freaky
in
appearance
but
aside
from
that
the
beer
is
just
mediocre
and
there
isnt
much
to
it
that
makes
the
beer
like
an
oktoberfest
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
only
worth
drinking
one
or
two
for
the
novelty
of
it
i
choked
my
way
through
a
glass
of
this
stuff
and
poured
the
rest
of
the
bomber
down
the
drain
this
stuff
is
like
trick
or
treat
and
you
just
got
tricked
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
more
marketing
than
substance
that
the
red
color
while
a
trademark
of
the
product
is
offputting
and
that
on
pretty
much
every
other
level
this
is
south
of
average
in
smell
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
than
its
counterparts
from
other
breweries
overall
not
a
very
drinkable
lager
but
certainly
fun
for
a
gimmick
would
like
to
pour
this
for
unsuspecting
guests
on
halloween
for
a
gag
go
out
and
buy
one
just
to
see
that
freaky
color
and
crack
it
open
after
trick
or
treat
overall
as
i
said
before
the
beer
messed
with
the
taste
buds
based
on
its
appearance
so
im
not
really
sure
it
wasnt
bad
but
id
like
to
try
it
again
with
my
brain
not
knowing
what
it
is
beforehand
pours
a
unique
red
color
like
a
red
soda
with
a
thick
foamy
two
finger
head
that
gives
way
to
very
little
lacing
the
color
is
very
nice
and
i
will
give
it
that
it
is
different
and
i
like
that
the
color
is
crystal
clear
the
smell
is
of
earthy
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
a
roasted
malt
and
a
caramel
malt
smell
the
taste
is
of
earth
hops
up
front
the
backbone
is
a
caramel
malt
the
end
has
a
nice
sweet
taste
that
is
hidden
in
there
maybe
cherry
or
a
nice
sweet
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
beers
this
is
a
little
more
flavorful
than
most
red
lagers
it
seemed
like
there
was
more
of
a
hop
character
than
others
overall
i
think
this
is
a
solid
beer
especially
consdering
the
style
which
is
usually
boring
i
would
recommend
trying
this
one
for
halloween
itd
be
a
fun
beer
for
a
halloween
party
but
maybe
just
for
a
glass
d
ok
there
are
some
haters
out
there
for
this
beer
but
i
have
to
say
that
it
isnt
bad
and
should
be
rated
as
a
lager
vs
a
marzen
per
the
category
this
is
placed
in
i
could
definately
have
it
again
good
offering
by
shmaltz
drinkability
overall
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
didnt
exactly
love
it
either
i
see
this
as
a
gimmicky
beer
at
the
most
and
lacks
really
what
a
true
amber
lager
should
be
the
color
is
off
centered
and
different
and
thats
about
it
cool
to
say
i
have
tried
it
but
ill
skip
this
offering
from
here
on
out
appearance
is
wierd
very
red
kind
of
looks
like
grenadine
but
thinner
with
a
small
head
and
no
lacing
smell
is
very
weak
not
a
lot
here
faint
caramel
and
a
bit
yeasty
taste
is
a
bit
better
not
really
an
oktoberfest
as
mentioned
on
the
label
mouthfeel
is
decent
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
alright
this
isnt
a
horrible
beer
but
the
concept
of
it
seemed
to
come
before
the
actually
brewing
of
it
pours
a
barely
translucent
strongly
red
mahogany
that
is
almost
blood
red
aroma
is
richly
spicy
and
slightly
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
cherry
spicy
flavor
has
subtle
cherry
undertone
and
a
woody
hint
texture
is
quite
smooth
and
fairly
fizzy
and
leaves
a
woody
and
spicy
finish
wow
this
beer
is
red
red
red
i
poured
this
from
a
22oz
bomber
and
i
found
there
to
be
a
huge
bright
pink
head
the
head
stuck
around
for
a
while
but
when
it
did
start
to
go
away
it
left
quite
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
it
boasts
on
the
lable
6
malts
6
hops
and
6
66
alcohol
i
have
no
idea
how
they
got
this
color
from
just
grain
but
i
like
it
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
but
not
oversweet
it
has
flavors
of
grass
and
licorice
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
i
am
not
a
very
big
fan
of
oktoberfest
beers
but
this
one
definetly
changed
my
mind
it
does
say
on
the
label
this
is
not
an
oktoberfest
this
is
freaktoberfest
i
would
definetly
get
this
again
and
would
love
to
try
one
on
tap
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
a
novelty
the
flavor
was
not
the
best
for
its
style
or
even
truly
representative
of
an
octoberfest
however
what
do
you
expect
when
a
picture
of
a
mad
clown
is
centered
on
the
label
and
the
beer
is
brewed
at
6
66
abv
i
would
definitely
enjoy
to
drink
this
on
halloween
while
watching
some
cheesy
ed
wood
films
or
listening
to
some
classic
misfits
its
inspiring
for
that
kind
of
mood
overall
a
very
strange
beer
not
that
bad
just
cant
get
past
the
color
also
has
a
weird
taste
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
a
strange
beer
to
be
sure
with
its
outright
bizarre
and
surprising
color
and
nonaromatic
scent
yet
has
a
fun
lightly
dancing
array
of
fruity
flavors
that
equal
any
easy
drinking
that
would
take
place
during
warmer
weather
days
this
beer
is
a
crazy
shade
of
blood
red
with
almost
a
pink
fuchsia
hue
it
has
a
lot
of
head
that
goes
fast
just
to
form
so
moderate
lace
the
aroma
is
malt
but
also
like
sweet
berries
it
has
a
bitter
taste
with
some
fruity
hop
esters
there
are
some
grain
tones
not
a
bad
beer
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
bite
d
this
beer
looks
bad
and
tastes
worse
why
would
a
seemingly
legitimate
microbrewery
want
to
make
a
beer
like
this
it
is
awful
and
ends
up
as
a
drain
pour
one
of
only
two
or
three
i
have
ever
been
forced
to
pour
out
this
should
never
have
made
it
into
a
bottle
a
headache
sinks
in
that
is
the
end
of
that
nothing
absolutely
outstanding
or
mindblowing
but
easily
drinkable
a
bit
of
a
novelty
perhaps
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
and
falls
in
nicely
in
its
flavor
profile
with
other
oktoberfest
lagers
and
would
make
a
nice
conversation
piece
at
a
halloween
party
pours
out
of
the
bottle
almost
blood
red
and
then
settles
to
a
rose
amber
red
body
in
the
glass
head
is
well
pink
soft
and
fluffy
very
light
pink
but
definitely
pink
leaves
a
crown
of
lace
almost
an
inch
high
as
it
slowly
fades
nose
is
mineraly
and
slightly
nutty
with
some
soft
malt
in
the
background
enters
the
mouth
with
some
scattered
hops
that
are
quickly
balanced
by
some
woodsy
mineral
based
malt
really
stays
more
on
the
skunky
side
although
mellow
german
style
of
the
brew
slightly
bitter
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
but
yet
consistently
filled
with
a
soft
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
turns
almost
creamy
thick
as
you
drink
very
nicely
drinkable
maybe
someone
out
there
likes
what
shmaltz
brewing
hath
wrought
who
knows
as
a
less
than
wellbrewed
oktoberfest
freaktoberfest
will
set
you
back
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
6
19
as
a
joke
beer
on
halloween
priceless
holy
shit
its
fake
blood
red
i
guess
i
should
have
expected
that
the
body
is
clear
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
fluffy
pink
head
great
lacing
you
get
an
inital
aroma
of
fruit
witch
develops
more
in
to
dates
and
rasberrys
theres
a
bit
of
citric
hops
and
grapefruit
rind
as
well
although
a
bit
kitchy
this
beer
is
fun
and
the
flavors
dont
hurt
eather
strange
to
look
at
but
not
a
bad
drinker
d
good
surprised
it
has
a
c
average
slightly
over
hopped
for
a
lager
but
drinks
more
like
an
ale
not
sure
what
this
is
but
the
malthops
balance
is
good
and
the
profiles
of
each
are
a
little
different
from
the
norm
and
it
feels
great
so
im
down
yeah
its
a
novelty
the
color
the
crazy
label
the
6
66
abv
but
so
what
its
kind
of
fun

d
notes
a
fine
beer
but
nothing
really
special
besides
the
color
antics
related
to
halloween
i
found
this
pretty
sessionable
though
d
after
a
fairly
good
start
appearance
and
aroma
wise
the
beer
seems
to
slide
downhill
after
that
with
a
mediocre
flavor
and
mouthful
with
an
limited
appeal
and
repeatability
factor
worthy
a
curious
peek
at
best
but
highly
unlikely
to
draw
you
back
the
bloodred
color
does
take
some
getting
used
to
it
is
best
just
not
to
look
at
the
beer
while
you
are
drinking
it
does
taste
like
an
average
lager
with
a
funky
twist
thin
mouthfeel
slightly
sweet
and
syrupy
after
it
warms
it
yields
a
burnt
aftertaste
and
not
in
a
good
way
d
an
entertaining
beer
if
i
have
ever
had
one
if
i
did
not
see
this
beer
before
i
drank
it
i
wouldnt
have
thought
much
of
it
but
its
a
looker
anyway
i
had
fun
with
this
beer
and
i
guess
thats
what
theyre
after
coney
island
is
a
weird
place
and
this
is
a
weird
beer
and
it
fits
right
in
its
freaky
to
be
sure
and
i
like
it
poured
this
beer
into
my
pint
glass
and
was
surprised
by
raspberryesque
color
and
the
two
inch
pinkish
head
to
match
and
for
me
it
kind
of
went
down
hill
from
there
not
much
in
the
nose
and
a
bag
full
of
plain
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
both
low
not
a
pleasant
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
typically
do
like
this
one
played
out
like
a
typical
lager
that
was
dyed
a
funky
color
for
some
reason
d
good
once
youre
past
the
novelty
of
a
bright
redcolored
beer
this
is
a
decent
lager
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
a
pint
would
be
fine
the
22
oz
is
plenty
havent
seen
this
on
the
shelves
for
a
few
weeks
since
the
arrival
of
winter
seasonals
and
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
again
if
it
returns
next
fall
worth
a
try
at
least
for
the
sake
of
curiosity
this
is
a
freaky
good
beer
taste
malty
sweet
and
slighty
sour
after
it
warms
i
pick
up
the
red
dye
aftertaste
not
the
most
unpleasant
but
worthy
of
a
try
well
i
guess
the
worst
part
of
this
beer
is
the
look
but
i
cant
really
knock
that
since
too
much
since
it
is
more
of
a
gimmick
thats
done
for
the
halloween
season
other
than
that
i
found
this
to
be
a
fairly
tasty
crisp
and
easy
drinking
affair
not
bad
d
the
sad
sad
thing
is
that
you
can
tell
that
underneath
the
stupid
purple
color
and
the
horrid
fruit
punch
flavor
there
is
actually
a
solid
well
built
beer
i
mean
you
can
tell
from
the
mouthfeel
and
hoppy
dry
finish
that
the
fruit
has
ruined
what
could
have
been
a
good
beer
its
like
seeing
a
toothless
methaddicted
streetwalker
and
being
able
to
imagine
the
pretty
young
happy
and
successful
girl
she
would
have
been
if
she
had
stayed
away
from
that
shit
d
i
guess
you
could
have
more
than
one
but
isnt
really
a
session
beer
wasnt
great
wasnt
horrible
but
definately
different
cool
lokking
bottle
though
d
ok

clearly
a
beer

2008
sum
it
up
in
a
few
words
i
purchased
it
because
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
pumpkin
beer
and
the
liquor
store
had
no
other
options
not
unhappy
but
not
amazed
easily
one
of
the
worst
pumpkin
ales
out
there
light
beer
with
a
nice
light
spiced
pumpkin
flavor
too
much
carbonation
surprisingly
good
mild
pumpkin
and
spice
balance
is
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
there
is
nothing
off
putting
about
the
beer
awful
taste
more
like
rotten
pumpkin
wheat
cheers
a
little
too
much
cinnamon
taste
for
me
but
still
enjoyable
overall
for
me
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
for
the
price
i
recommend
it
poured
a
clear
orange
body
with
abundant
carbonation
bubbles
and
no
head
it
looks
like
a
poor
watery
pumpkin
ale
scents
of
pumpkin
apple
juice
sweet
spices
with
an
emphasis
on
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
very
sweet
pumpkin
forward
aroma
too
sweet
with
no
real
balance
flavor
begins
sweet
with
notes
of
pumpkin
sweet
spices
with
notes
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
and
mediumlight
apple
cider
middle
is
sweet
with
the
same
flavors
continuing
finish
is
sweet
with
notes
of
pumpkin
and
sweet
spices
the
same
flavors
continue
aftertaste
is
sweet
spices
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
some
pumpkin
overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
very
sweet
pumpkin
ale
without
much
balance
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
an
okay
aleeasy
to
drink
but
note
a
witbier
overall
this
is
an
okay
ale
it
is
too
sweet
in
aroma
and
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
amazing
nothing
special
and
one
of
the
weaker
pumpkin
beers
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
body
with
thick
beige
head
the
head
reduces
to
a
thin
film
in
no
time
at
all
relatively
little
aroma
a
veggie
squash
scent
taste
is
rather
bland
bready
plain
pumpkin
no
spices
meh
just
no
meh
simple
holiday
brew
very
fake
sweet
taste
but
with
the
turkey
and
the
knitsweater
itll
do
donkey
well
i
imagine
the
water
in
that
well
is
basically
what
is
used
to
make
this
beer
i
have
had
good
pumpkin
beer
before
but
not
this
you
do
not
even
taste
the
pumpkin
its
almost
like
someone
dropped
a
cigarette
butt
in
your
bottle
good
pumpkin
beer
for
the
price
i
have
noticed
that
many
pumpkin
beers
were
not
around
for
long
and
are
expensive
this
one
you
can
get
and
it
is
cheaper
i
hope
it
is
around
so
i
can
have
it
at
thanksgiving
better
then
the
coors
blue
moon
lighter
and
more
drinkable
i
will
often
drink
a
more
expensive
pumpkin
beer
and
then
switch
to
this
if
it
is
a
bon
fire
night
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
but
not
the
worst
i
have
had
the
pumpkin
spice
flavor
is
mild
and
you
clearly
taste
the
wheat
i
just
dont
know
if
i
like
pumpkin
and
wheat
combined
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
but
straight
out
of
the
bottle
is
just
fine
one
of
the
worst
pumpkin
beers
call
me
as
fool
but
i
like
the
pumpkin
version
of
shock
top
better
than
the
original
as
its
pumpkin
i
doubt
id
drink
it
all
year
round
but
then
again
i
might
i
think
the
aroma
is
great
and
that
the
spicing
balances
the
malt
and
rounds
it
out
nicely
additionally
unlike
many
pumpkin
beers
that
utilize
too
much
cinnamon
thats
not
the
case
here
and
i
can
actually
taste
the
nutmeg
clearly
at
the
very
least
in
the
realm
of
pumpkin
beers
its
definitely
more
towards
the
top
of
the
heap
than
the
bottom
1100
i
give
it
a
91
really
liked
the
flavor
not
too
strong
and
light
overall
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
not
that
its
my
favorite
style
shock
tops
toneddown
style
works
pretty
well
here
as
i
dont
want
too
much
pumpkin
in
my
beer
the
smell
of
the
brew
is
a
light
smell
as
well
as
the
taste
for
pumpkin
beer
i
felt
there
could
be
a
stronger
flavor
and
spice
but
maybe
that
is
why
i
am
still
okay
with
it
also
the
can
i
have
says
the
abv
is
5
1
not
that
it
is
much
difference
just
found
that
interesting
shock
top
pumpkin
wheat
brewed
by
anheuserbusch
with
an
abv
of
5
2
this
brew
pours
out
of
a
brown
bottle
a
light
brown
amber
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
with
pumpkin
and
some
grains
you
also
pick
up
on
some
spices
in
this
brew
the
taste
is
rich
with
flavor
you
pick
up
on
pumpkin
and
spices
and
some
grains
at
the
end
not
as
much
flavor
as
i
would
like
to
see
in
a
pumpkin
brew
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
there
is
nothing
over
powering
in
this
brew
pumpkin
wheat
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
overall
im
giving
this
brew
4
out
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
an
alright
pumpkin
beer
not
quite
as
good
a
major
competitor
though
a
little
bit
a
sweet
taste
in
the
first
swallow
but
overall
i
would
drink
it
again
a
very
average
pumpkin
beer
its
enjoyable
and
cheap
and
readily
available
but
its
way
down
the
list
of
pumpkin
beers
id
go
for
very
nice
for
a
pumpkin
wheat
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
of
the
year
the
pour
was
a
pale
orange
and
the
head
was
fizzy
and
did
not
trail
the
smell
was
mostly
wheat
to
the
point
where
it
smelled
like
and
average
shock
top
and
the
taste
kind
of
was
mild
wheat
flavor
with
a
bit
of
artificial
pumpkin
instead
of
the
usual
orange
didnt
care
too
much
for
it
pretty
good
pumpkin
flavor
orange
in
color
overall
slightly
better
than
i
expected
could
use
more
pumpkin
flavor
but
this
is
no
micro
brew
not
bad
i
would
drink
this
again
or
even
on
draft
at
a
bar
if
this
was
an
offer
the
spice
taste
was
not
overpowering
either
if
the
pumpkin
was
stronger
it
would
score
better
pours
a
orangeamber
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
lasts
the
whole
drink
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
small
steaming
bubbles
rising
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
whole
time
but
perfect
carbonation
actually
the
aroma
is
of
very
light
pumpkin
and
spices
mostly
cloves
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
more
spices
of
cloves
nutmeg
coming
out
then
the
light
pumpkin
and
wheat
flavor
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
overall
it
wasnt
bad
definitely
not
the
worst
pumpkin
beer
out
there
but
far
from
the
best
what
we
have
here
is
a
pumpkin
beer
that
has
potential
but
fails
to
live
up
to
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
spiced
beer
thats
not
going
to
weigh
you
down
after
a
few
back
to
back
this
is
worth
consideration
however
if
youre
looking
for
a
full
bodied
pumpkin
to
take
your
time
with
this
isnt
it
o
this
beer
has
nice
aromas
of
pumpkins
and
pumpkin
spices
but
these
seem
like
these
could
be
a
little
stronger
not
bad
but
not
an
every
day
kind
of
beer
over
all
nice
pumpkin
beer
not
too
overwhelming
easy
to
drink
the
feel
is
not
surprisingly
somewhat
too
thin
and
the
graininess
contributes
to
an
uncleanness
on
the
palate
it
has
some
substance
to
be
sure
and
the
crispness
adds
something
to
it
beside
that
its
not
too
far
from
smooth
either
still
stronger
malts
and
a
cleaner
feel
would
be
beneficial
ok
beer
one
of
my
favorite
shock
tops
at
least
overall
not
a
really
good
pumpkin
ale
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
ive
never
tried
the
cinnamon
challenge
but
this
has
to
be
close
to
the
same
dose
of
spices
you
get
cannonballing
straight
cinnamon
overpowering
pungent
perfumy
spices
hit
your
senses
like
a
runaway
semi
truck
i
new
it
was
bmc
i
new
it
was
gonna
suck

i
tried
it
anyway

bottle
has
a

with
a

inch
head
there
are
some
floaties
in
the
glass
here
smell
is
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
some
other
spices
taste
is
the
same
only
milder
just
a
touch
of
wheat
coming
through
after
the
spices
and
pumpkin
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
easy
drinking
brew
i
could
enjoy
several
of
nothing
too
great
about
this
beer
skip
it
and
move
onto
another
i
am
like
the
late
frank
sinatra
and
sid
vicious
in
that
i
did
it
my
way
i
inverted
the
bottle
several
times
to
get
it
stirred
up
before
i
even
unscrewed
the
cap
and
then
used
an
aggro
pour
to
ensure
both
blending
and
release
what
an
insult
to
my
intellect
i
got
a
fizzy
fingers
of
tawny
head
that
initially
fell
quickly
and
towards
their
end
suddenly
created
a
cap
that
hung
in
quite
well
color

it
must
kill
them
not
to
filter
the
living
daylights
out
of
these
beers
hee
hee
i
got
a
lot
of
nutmeg
followed
by
cinnamon
and
cloves
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
and
the
taste
was
prevalently
cinnamon
with
the
other
spices
relegated
to
a
backup
role
finish
was
semidry
thanks
to
all
of
the
spices
but
i
still
felt
unfulfilled
it
just
seemed
to
lack
depth
and
oomph
o
i
was
very
impressed
i
didnt
expect
much
but
this
beer
had
a
very
good
flavor
to
it
no
problem
picking
this
one
up
again
ab
has
put
together
a
good
product
here
it
tastes
like
a
true
craft
beer
with
more
complexity
than
ab
is
known
for
id
gladly
have
this
again
over
all
an
average
fall
seasonal
reasonably
priced
i
doubt
ill
have
this
again
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
not
my
favorite
but
not
the
worst
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
i
would
not
turn
one
down
the
verdict
not
bad
smooth
inoffensive
take
on
a
seasonal
brew
from
anheuserbusch
o
not
a
horrible
offering
from
shock
top
which
i
had
kind
of
expected
so
i
guess
you
could
say
that
this
one
exceed
expectations
fairly
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
blend
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
dominating
without
being
too
sweet

the
taste
was
all
wrong
as
the
taste
of
pumpkin
was
washed
away
quickly
on
the
palate
an
exceptionally
carbonated
feel
and
rush
of
bubbles
rinsed
the
palate
of
any
real
pumpkin
spice
or
wheat
taste
what
made
this
average
and
not
below
was
that
i
could
taste
what
was
on
the
mind
of
the
brewer
but
it
simply
never
reached
me
o
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beer
figured
id
pick
it
up
since
i
do
love
pumpkin
beers
very
nice
late
summerearly
fall
beer
a
little
heaviness
to
it
not
too
much
pumpkin
muted
fall
flavors
if
this
had
been
marketed
as
a
fall
seasonal
and
not
a
pumpkin
beer
specifically
i
never
would
have
marked
it
as
one
a
very
pleasant
beer
but
definitely
not
the
kind
of
pumpkin
beer
im
used
to
the
taste
is
okay
but
has
a
light
spice
and
mild
wheat
flavor
with
somewhat
yeast
driven
taste
with
some
cooked
corn
type
creamy
taste
with
subtle
tangy
fruitiness
and
mild
grainy
quality
overall
i
was
not
impressed
but
it
has
the
fall
spice
you
may
expect
coupled
with
the
ordinary
shocktop
wheat
flavors
and
mild
caramel
elements
it
is
not
bad
but
one
is
all
i
really
need
to
have
a
little
better
than
what
im
used
to
getting
from
an
anheuserbusch
beer
this
pumpkin
ale
is
brewed
with
pumpkin
rather
than
pumpkin
being
added
later
shipyard
im
looking
at
you
which
is
certainly
appreciated
and
expected
smell
is
pleasant
with
a
good
balance
of
pumpkin
and
spice
but
not
much
complexity
this
doesnt
taste
much
like
the
wheat
beer
that
it
is
maybe
because
the
yeast
drowns
out
the
wheat
pumpkin
and
spice
taste
good
but
not
all
that
fresh
or
interesting
mouthfeel
is
relatively
thin
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
it
goes
down
well
and
the
aftertaste
is
simple
with
just
a
touch
of
spice
lingering
overall
this
isnt
remarkable
by
any
means
it
is
simple
and
decent
m
light
easy
to
drink
overcarbonated
wheat
beer
with
decent
pumpkin
flavor
but
a
poor
finish
not
terrible
but
could
have
been
done
much
better
this
beer
is
just
ok
not
something
to
write
home
about
it
has
a
nice
color
an
average
head
i
did
not
pick
up
any
wheat
taste
or
smell
at
all
the
punpkin
taste
seemed
to
me
to
be
by
addition
of
pumpkin
spices
off
the
supermarket
shelve
i
liked
that
it
was
sweeter
than
most
it
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
but
not
something
i
want
to
have
again
but
in
this
beer
i
like
it
fine
good
on
ya
anheuser
busch
overall
this
beer
has
an
artificial
feel
surrounding
it
from
the
aroma
to
the
flavor
to
the
mouthfeel
one
thing
going
for
it
is
that
it
is
quite
refreshing
when
ice
cold
but
that
is
about
the
only
positive
thing
i
can
say
not
a
beer
i
plan
on
having
again
o
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
loads
better
that
blue
moons
attempt
flavor
is
a
bit
weird
as
the
pumpkin
and
wheat
seem
to
cancel
each
other
out
in
a
sense
this
yields
a
pleasant
enough
flavor
but
one
with
little
depth
or
ability
to
linger
no
notable
bitterness
or
spice
flavor
finish
is
a
bit
thin
with
a
light
citric
punch
overall
quite
unobtrusive
yet
quite
drinkable
given
the
lack
of
complexity
and
minimal
spice
notes
pretty
good
brew
considering
the
source
not
bad
i
like
a
yeast
driven
pumpkin
o
i
actually
enjoyed
this
brew
find
it
somewhat
like
the
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
if
the
mouthfeel
didnt
completely
suck
i
honestly
think
this
would
be
an
excellent
brew

noticeable
head
retention
is
ok
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
nice
but
weak
it
smells
like
some
pumpkin
wheat
nutmeg
and
some
cloves
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
a
slight
sour
breadlike
finish
its
not
bad
tasting
but
not
exactly
good
either
mouthfeelbody
is

its
surprisingly
a
bit
slick
and
creamy
but
with
high
carbonation
not
really
impressed
by
this
one
but
its
drinkable
got
this
bottle
from
a
friend
so
i
cant
complain
too
much
not
a
bad
pumnpkin
beer
nice
in
a
wheat
variety
really
not
as
commonly
done
as
it
probably
should
be
the
pours
is
orange
hued
and
hazy
pale
colored
with
a
decent
off
white
head
fades
quick
the
nose
is
more
spice
than
squash
cinnamon
and
clove
even
ginger
or
something
too
yeasty
as
always
the
flavor
is
also
more
spice
than
pumpkin
lots
of
vanilla
and
clove
and
some
pepper
from
the
yeast
its
sweet
and
palatable
with
a
quick
finish
and
a
drinkable
medium
body
and
bright
carbonation
its
a
little
filling
though
and
fall
is
a
time
for
all
day
drinking
so
this
isnt
the
ideal
product
for
that
but
its
a
lot
better
than
regular
shock
top
and
the
other
spin
offs
ive
had
overall
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
are
in
a
wasteland
that
only
carries
mass
produced
stuff
really
not
bad
i
must
be
a
sucker
for
punishment
or
ticking
well
this
stuff
was
incredibly
popular
last
year
so
i
might
as
well
finally
give
it
a
try
it
pours
a
clear
sunset
orangebronze
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
biscuit
nothing
more
nothing
less
the
taste
holds
notes
of
funky
wheat
what
may
or
may
not
be
pumpkin
and
a
light
dusting
of
cinnamon
things
do
not
mesh
well
at
all
frankly
and
a
bad
taste
is
literally
left
in
my
mouth
in
the
end
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
nearly
watery
feel
overall
a
sad
little
pumpkin
beer
one
whose
popularity
will
remain
a
mystery
to
me
now
overall
i
was
pleased
ive
been
trying
a
lot
of
new
beers
lately
and
havent
been
too
impressed
but
was
happy
with
this
submit
by
shock
top
they
havent
done
much
to
disappoint
me
overall
pumpkin
ales
dont
get
much
worse
than
this
and
its
a
shame
the
pumpkin
to
spice
ratio
felt
right
but
the
watered
down
body
tarnished
anything
that
might
have
been
o
overall
a
decent
pumkin
beer
though
nothing
mind
blowing
the
nose
is
a
bit
weak
and
bland
but
the
taste
was
good
and
it
was
better
than
i
expected
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
but
worth
checking
out
if
you
love
the
style
and
see
it
on
tap
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
i
cant
handle
to
much
pumpkin
but
i
do
enjoy
a
little
pumpkin
in
beer
during
the
festive
fall
aroma
has
a
nutty
pumpkin
smell
to
it
appearance
looks
nice
with
a
decent
head
taste
pumpkin
with
wheat
just
as
you
would
guess
palate
good
co2
on
it
with
the
ability
to
drink
a
couple
not
a
few
though
overall
i
would
reach
for
another
one
down
the
road
better
than
anticipated
but
i
anticipated
it
to
the
awful
aside
from
the
aftertaste
it
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
theres
a
glimmer
of
wow
but
it
quickly
fades
if
they
could
continue
that
flash
of
brilliance
throughout
the
whole
beers
taste
it
would
be
a
contender
for
the
best
pumpkin
ale
not
bad
i
am
actually
somewhat
impressed
considering
my
lower
than
low
expectations
tasteoverall
tasty
pumpkin
spice
flavors
not
to
strong
to
much
carbonation
nice
beer
to
drink
around
october
and
halloween
or
if
you
want
to
drink
a
pumpkin
beer
better
then
the
blue
moon
pumpkin
beer
i
think
id
try
it
again
next
october
overall
a
pretty
bland
pumpkin
ale
but
what
do
you
really
expect
from
the
shock
top
brand
i
guess
its
good
to
see
that
theyre
expanding
their
range
but
this
really
isnt
anything
special
shock
is
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
for
a
hot
day
thirst
quencher
thumb
up
i
recommend
it
with
a
little
hesitation
i
dont
think
it
will
shock
you
but
you
may
have
have
a
pleasant
time
drinking
this
beer
this
beer
is
really
meant
to
drank
to
some
mellow
rock
from
the
70s
you
know
steely
dan
aja
fleetwood
mac
or
hello
its
me
by
todd
rundgren
overall
this
is
an
ok
to
below
average
pumpkin
ale
but
from
anheuserbusch
surprisingly
decent
o
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
a
pumpkin
ale
but
its
definitely
a
nice
fall
brew
a
mediocre
brew
here
some
wheat
character
some
pumpkin
character
and
mainly
washed
out
after
the
finish
personally
i
dont
care
much
for
overdone
spicing
but
everything
about
this
is
rather
weak
not
offensive
just
weak
i
sampled
this
beer
along
with
two
other
similar
choices
sierra
nevada
tumbler
and
dundee
oktoberfest
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
was
pumpkin
in
color
and
and
hit
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
it
beat
my
average
expectations
i
didnt
expect
much
and
i
got
more
m
a
little
too
carbonated
and
light
bodied
o
this
pumpkin
is
surprisingly
better
than
anticipated
especially
with
the
underwhelming
track
record
of
shock
top
seasonals
but
this
pumpkin
wheat
is
moderately
flavorful
balanced
and
drinkable
everything
one
might
expect
while
maintaining
a
profile
that
wont
offend
their
customer
base
a
good
training
wheel
pumpkin
for
example
however
it
certainly
wont
satisfy
the
desires
of
anyone
really
craving
a
rich
pumpkin
brew
all
in
all
i
could
probably
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
o
its
very
drinkable
but
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
when
wanting
a
really
enjoyable
pumpkin
beer
for
me
this
is
a
run
of
the
mill
wheat
beer
with
slight
pumpkin
hints
i
really
wanted
the
pumpkin
and
especially
the
spice
to
hit
my
mouth
a
lot
harder
ill
most
likely
buy
it
again
though
because
its
cheap
easy
to
find
and
a
pretty
easy
drink
to
enjoy
with
some
friends
or
with
a
meal
there
are
much
beer
pumpkin
beers
out
there
but
this
isnt
bad
o
i
would
by
shipyard
pumpkin
ale
for
the
seasonal
pumpkins
it
is
much
better
overall
better
than
i
expected
a
sessionable
wheaty
and
solid
pumpkin
beer
i
could
have
a
six
on
a
fall
day
nothing
outstanding
and
there
are
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
but
nothing
to
pass
up
either
the
finish
is
the
worst
part
it
is
long
but
the
taste
is
bad
so
ya
just
sit
there
wishing
the
flavor
would
go
away
it
has
a
very
bad
light
beer
aftertaste
boo
o
i
love
wheat
beer
all
kinds
of
it
but
this
pumpkin
spice
is
a
very
good
product
although
jacks
pumpkin
spice
ale
was
better
this
has
not
been
a
complete
disappointment
i
have
tried
several
pumpkin
beers
ales
there
are
some
very
good
ones
out
there
overall
a
tasty
pumpkin
beer
with
a
easy
drinking
sweetness
and
spiced
pumpkin
flavor
while
not
the
top
pumpkin
brew
out
there
it
is
one
of
the
best
for
its
price
and
one
to
go
to
on
occasion
solid
beer
overall
i
am
not
sure
there
can
be
better
balance
of
pumpkin
and
wheat
in
a
beer
easy
drinker
this
will
be
a
nice
beer
for
those
hot
autumn
afternoons
here
in
florida
this
is
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
does
not
immediately
overwhelm
the
senses
with
the
powerful
aroma
or
taste
of
what
it
is
going
for
yet
still
retains
the
feeling
as
if
october
is
getting
closer
with
every
sip
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
although
i
dont
think
i
would
session
this
one
this
is
pretty
much
a
light
pumpkin
ale
didnt
really
get
any
witbier
like
flavors
out
of
it
about
on
par
with
what
i
expected
something
i
would
definatly
avoid
in
the
future
tastes
like
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
mixed
with
bud
overall
this
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
im
not
a
fan
of
inbev
however
this
is
a
likable
beer
that
with
the
right
company
is
even
better
the
label
is
a
marketing
tactic
looks
cool
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
am
cooler
than
an
ordinary
day
of
coolness
when
i
have
one
in
my
hand
i
asked
my

to
get
me
a

and
watched

contorted
just
smelled
a
dead
body
kinda
face
and
folks
dont
let
this
beer
get
warm
nasty
the
last
swig
is
reserved
for
the
recycling
rats
at
the
redemption
center
i
wasnt
expecting
much
here
but
this
beer
is
actually
not
that
bad
descent
flavor
and
depth
above
average
among
pumpkin
beers
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
so
i
wont
be
going
back
to
it
regularly
but
descent
for
what
it
is
not
quite
as
thick
or
fulfilling
as
others
but
average
at
best
is
okay
to
try
but
like
i
said
average
at
best
in
the
seasonal
category
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
overall
this
seems
like
more
of
a
winter
warmer
but
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
this
beers
ok
there
are
better
pumpkin
beers
around
but
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
enough
to
think
about
overall
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
and
this
one
lacks
the
pumpkin
flavors
just
the
spices
are
present
as
a
holiday
beer
i
have
had
worse
it
is
pleasant
enough
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
one
again
i
thought
this
beer
was
overall
pleasantly
aromatic
and
tasty
its
a
pumpkinthemed
beer
and
it
tastes
like
pumpkin
for
sure
it
definitely
lives
up
to
the
theme
i
actually
didnt
get
much
of
a
pumpkin
taste
at
all
until
the
last
couple
of
sips
towards
the
end
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
but
then
again
what
do
you
expect
from
an
ab
product
i
had
a
random
bottle
left
in
my
fridge
from
the
fall
so
i
opened
it
tonight
poured
into
a
tall
wheat
glass
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
fizzy
carbonation
which
formed
a
decent
sized
white
head
hazy
orange
body
but
i
was
still
able
to
see
some
unsightly
floaties
lurking
in
there
smell
had
a
fake
aroma
of
holiday
spices
taste
was
not
horrible
but
id
consider
it
average
there
was
some
flavors
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
but
tasted
more
like
additives
mouthfeel
left
a
bit
of
a
sticky
feeling
on
the
palate
low
abv
made
it
simple
to
drink
not
a
great
pumpkin
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
it
may
open
some
bud
drinkers
minds
to
trying
other
pumpkin
ales
so
i
wont
knock
this
beer
too
hard
sorry
guys
im
going
to
pass
on
this
one
better
luck
next
time
o
im
not
going
to
say
this
is
the
best
example
of
this
beer
but
i
got
to
give
it
up
to
stannbus
for
putting
some
effort
into
this
beer
overall
as
with
many
other
macro
attempts
at
creating
more
craftoriented
beer
this
is
pretty
damn
good
however
true
to
form
it
also
is
just
short
of
aggressiveness
in
flavor
and
aroma
while
also
being
too
carbonated
to
make
it
a
great
beer
i
would
be
fine
having
this
again
but
wouldnt
search
it
out
this
could
also
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
to
newbies
o
overall
this
is
an
easydrinking
ale
but
is
nothing
remarkable
and
not
a
beer
id
seek
out
those
who
are
venturing
out
of
the
shaddow
of
industrial
lagers
may
find
comfort
with
this
grainysweet
version
of
pumpkin
ales
but
this
is
among
one
of
the
weakest
brands
on
the
market
why
does
ab
insist
on
producing
mediocre
beers
when
they
have
at
their
disposal
the
ability
to
produce
some
outstanding
ales
and
lagers
if
only
they
cared
about
the
costumer
a
light
and
not
just
the
almighty
dollar
the
beer
was
served
in
an
american
pint
glass
and
looked
really
good
the
appearance
was
a
slightly
brownish
orange
with
a
distinct
pumpkin
and
wheat
taste
that
lived
up
to
its
name
there
was
about
one
finger
of
creamy
tan
head
but
it
rapidly
dissipated
in
spite
of
the
small
head
there
was
a
good
amount
of
lacing
but
not
much
carbonation
i
found
the
beer
to
be
overall
lacking
in
mouthfeel
and
aroma
but
still
a
good
drinkable
brew
what
can
i
say
its
a
pumpkin
flavored
budweiser
overall
good
job
ab
youve
surprised
me
with
this
offering
a
delicious
pumpkin
ale
that
i
would
certainly
buy
again
o
overall
a
drinkable
beer
not
too
bad
the
handsdown
best
pumpkin
wheat
this
season
finishes
smooth
and
leaves
a
warm
pumpkin
pie
taste
in
your
mouth
be
sure
when
pouring
to
leave
about
an
inch
at
the
bottom
and
stir
the
bottle
to
bring
out
the
unfiltered
wheat
wonderful
i
bought
a
case
and
am
rationing
it
out
keeping
it
all
season
long
best
with
turkey
or
large
banquet
style
holiday
meals
enjoy
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
several
other
beers
in
the
style
better
than
this
one
pumpkin
taste
is
noticable
in
the
beginning
of
the
first
sip
then
the
cloves
nutmegand
allspice
take
over
the
beer
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
harsh
and
has
a
strange
aftertaste
overall
i
would
rate
this
at
the
bottom
of
the
pack
of
the
pumpkin
beers
i
have
tried
this
year
the
aftertaste
is
strange
and
even
turns
my
stomach
a
little
the
original
sips
arent
bad
and
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
slight
but
there
is
something
about
this
one
that
just
does
not
agree
i
dont
hate
it
but
i
wont
be
purchasing
this
one
again
ooverall
this
beer
is
just
ok
it
feels
like
the
beer
doesnt
know
what
it
wants
to
be
a
hefeweizen
or
a
pumpkin
ale
for
what
its
worth
its
better
than
the
shock
top
wheat
ale
base
nothing
special
though
still
better
than
what
a
majority
of
people
drank
during
pumpkin
carving
this
is
definitely
drinkable
but
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
out
there
overall
surprisingly
good
beer
from
michelob
o
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
but
nothing
thats
going
to
blow
your
pants
off
if
its
offered
to
you
for
free
gladly
accept
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
brew
it
was
a
bit
of
a
grab
bag
of
spice
but
it
captured
the
style
fairly
well
and
didnt
taste
bad
at
all
o
just
soso
not
unpleasant
but
not
enough
pumpkin
to
be
worthy
of
the
name
even
with
the
expected
spices
still
i
find
it
easier
to
down
than
plain
shock
top
o
i
like
many
types
of
brews
but
i
did
not
really
like
this
one
try
another
brand
if
looking
for
a
pumpkin
ale
do
this
is
an
enjoyable
changeofpace
but
the
wheat
makes
it
a
bit
heavy
and
detracts
from
its
drinkability
for
me
and
the
spices
make
it
a
bit
of
a
onetrick
pony
d
fair
at
best
wheat
beer
with
okay
use
of
spice
but
the
mix
doesnt
seem
quite
right
pumpkin
is
rather
strange
sort
of
unripe
more
vegetal
than
gourd
still
tons
more
flavor
and
character
than
their
mainstream
affair
okay
to
try
but
it
wont
be
calling
you
back
an
ok
pumpkin
to
get
introduced
to
the
style
not
extremely
flavorful
but
does
give
you
a
hint
of
the
spice
profile
harpoons
pumpkin
wheat
is
much
better
o
beer
1
in
a
halloween
eve
pumpkin
tasting
session
this
one
is
overspiced
particularly
in
the
roomfilling
aroma
tastes
like
halloween
says
a
fellow
tester
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
glass
in
two
parts
per
instructions
on
the
bottle
a
three
finger
bisque
colored
head
that
faded
quick
with
a
little
bit
of
residual
lacing
was
evident
the
second
pour
was
12
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
swirled
the
spices
and
topped
off
the
glass
its
okay
but
weaker
than
most
of
the
pumpkin
beers
but
far
better
than
the
buffalo
one
davidstoct

but
its
far
from
being
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
seek
out
something
a
bit
more
interesting
you
wont
be
sorry
notchucknorrisoct

there
is
minimal
if
any
lacing
color
of
beer
is
a
deep
its
not
bad
but
in
the
end
cinnamon
and
citrus
stand
out
grainy
foamy
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
it
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
chalky
its
lightly
flavored
with
lemony
wheat
the
spices
come
in
later
and
the
flavor
and
push
it
to
be

overall
impression
is
this
a
pumpkin
ale
or
american
wheat
beer
i
know
it
states
its
a
pumpkin
wheat
but
there
definitely
isnt
any
pumpkin
in
here
that
i
could
tell
have
to
rate
it
as
a
pumpkin
ale
and
i
say
avoid
did
not
do
anything
for
me
except
for
the
appearance
after
the
pour
from
the
pour
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
excellent
but
then
went
in
for
all
the
senses
and
my
eyes
were
bigger
than
my
stomach
o
it
was
better
than
i
expected
but
was
still
tended
toward
the
average
if
blue
moon
pumpkin
was
too
overthetop
in
flavor
for
you
this
is
the
beer
for
you
o
nothing
much
stands
out
here
the
pumpkin
was
also
very
mild
i
give
them
some
credit
for
trying
something
nontraditional
and
in
true
ab
fashion
it
has
drinkability
but
the
citrusy
and
plasticlike
quality
was
tough
for
me
to
accept
in
a
pumpkin
ale
sort
of
like
a
one
colored
jigsaw
puzzle
all
the
pieces
are
there
and
fit
but
there
isnt
much
to
it
the
spice
pumpkin
and
beeriness
just
dont
wow
nor
landing
equally
drinkable
overall
a
very
good
brew
especially
given
the
popularity
of
the
type
during
this
time
to
me
this
just
another
weak
attempt
at
pumpkin
beer
i
need
more
richness
this
is
a
one
done
i
cant
promise
ill
buy
another
6
pack
mostly
due
to
price
and
wanting
to
try
new
things
o
im
sure
there
are
better
quality
varieties
out
there
but
for
my
first
pumpkin
ale
i
have
to
say
i
quite
enjoyed
it
the
spices
remind
me
of
the
upcoming
holidays
and
that
makes
it
all
the
better
i
look
forward
to
sampling
many
more
pumpkin
ales
in
the
future
and
beers
in
general
pours
a
murky
copper
color
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
random
streaks
of
lace
cling
to
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
pumpkin
puree
sugars
and
typical
pumpkin
pie
spices
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
with
a
very
sweet
malt
flavor
to
go
along
with
the
pumpkin
and
spices
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
on
tap
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
much
better
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
every
aspect
of
the
beer
was
bumped
up
a
notch
to
make
this
serving
type
a
pretty
good
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
this
on
tap
over
from
a
bottle
overall
not
bad
for
a
shock
top
but
the
flavor
profile
is
weak
and
this
one
comes
off
a
little
thin
overall
not
a
great
beer
in
my
opinion
basically
tastes
like
shock
top
and
nutmeg
the
mouthfeel
is
awful
and
i
definitely
do
not
want
another
one
of
these
this
beer
has
good
potential
the
tastes
are
pretty
well
balanced
its
just
too
thin
and
watery
for
my
liking
its
one
of
the
best
coors
products
ive
had
yet
although
its
nothing
special
still
pumpkins
are
tough
beers
to
make
and
this
one
wasnt
half
bad
maybe
one
day
the
big
three
will
figure
out
what
a
craft
beer
is
after
all
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
fresh
pumpkin
and
spice
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
excellent
pumpkin
flavor
with
minimal
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spicing
the
malt
profile
keeps
the
flavor
light
but
i
feel
it
would
be
better
with
the
addition
of
more
pale
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
wonder
why
they
decided
to
add
pumpkin
to
an
american
wheat
ale
in
instead
of
the
traditional
pale
ale
there
arent
too
many
great
pumpkins
out
there
but
charlie
brown
would
agree
that
this
is
one
it
may
have
a
bit
more
spice
than
pumpkin
but
it
works
i
will
buy
this
a
again
this
fall
over
this
beer
is
decent
not
bad
but
nothing
special
the
price
is
right
7
dollars
a
6er
at
my
local
bd
i
probably
wont
pick
this
up
again
a
slightly
hazed
orange
tinted
copper
hue
with
a
light
tan
head
fizzy
and
dwindling
quickly
by
the
way
no
lacing
left
behind
on
my
glass
in
this
one
this
one
is
abrasive
with
pumpkin
pie
spices
almost
a
sugar
coated
cinnamon
nutmeg
all
spice
pumpkin
pie
kick
going
on
is
there
a
wheat
beer
in
there
somewhere
im
sure
there
is
but
where
pumpkin
pie
spice
massive
loads
of
residual
sugar
first
off
you
must
like
these
pumpkin
beers
to
begin
with
and
secondly
i
tend
to
like
the
ones
with
actual
pumpkin
flesh
the
gourd
not
just
the
pie
spices
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
a
bit
cloying
with
residual
sugars
and
loads
of
pie
spices
definitely
not
the
worse
but
by
far
something
im
going
to
be
reaching
for
anytime
soon
quit
jumping
on
bandwagons
and
marketing
trends
and
make
some
honestly
good
beer
next
time
o
this
seems
like
a
decent
pumpkin
offering
but
there
are
many
better
choices
available
this
is
a
boring
pumpkin
beer
but
isnt
horribly
offensive
actually
a
more
exciting
beer
than
expected
id
grab
one
of
these
over
a
regular
shock
top
anytime
give
to
a
yellow
fizzy
drinker
and
start
the
change
over
to
better
beer
it
may
encourage
them
that
this
one
came
from
the
big
boys
o
i
would
say
average
for
a
p
a
could
be
improved
on
for
sure
this
is
an
ab
product
so
with
that
in
mind
its
not
bad
for
them
tastea
rather
thin
mix
of
clove
cinnamonnutmeg
and
faint
pumpkin
flavor
a
mishmash
of
unbalanced
flavors
leading
to
a
rather
medicinal
finish
sessionable
by
abv
only
one
and
done
for
me
overall
not
a
horrible
beer
but
improvements
could
be
made
to
it
i
had
this
one
with
a
light
dinner
and
it
worked
out
ok
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
but
id
accept
one
if
offered
it
by
a
friend
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
orange
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
the
head
settles
and
fades
into
nothing
there
is
no
lacing
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
spicy
has
a
little
bit
of
a
sweet
aroma
too
the
taste
is
has
a
light
spicy
flavor
a
little
too
light
i
think
the
aftertaste
is
boring
to
me
its
too
watered
down
i
think
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
overall
not
surprised
by
this
at
all
really
didnt
expect
something
wonderful
here
basically
i
just
wanted
to
try
it
overall
drinkable
but
there
are
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
not
as
bad
as
i
though
it
would
be
honestly
ive
had
far
better
pumpkins
but
ive
had
worse
as
well
the
biggest
criticism
is
the
lack
of
pumpkin
taste
its
more
of
a
sweetish
wheat
beer
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
than
a
true
pumpkin
ale
to
me
wouldnt
be
my
number
one
pick
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
o
there
are
so
many
better
options
for
pumpkin
beer
out
there
i
picked
up
a
single
of
this
on
a
whim
to
see
if
ab
could
do
something
solid
like
they
did
with
the
raspberry
wheat
they
failed
miserably
bottle
marked

2011
the
pour
is
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
little
head
to
top
it
off
on
the
nose
there
is
a
pleasing
enough
note
of
pumpkin
spices
and
wheat
the
body
tended
to
be
thinner
than
most
the
pumpkin
was
subtle
and
mild
in
the
taste
as
it
gave
way
to
a
more
bitter
experience
with
a
dash
of
spices
and
a
near
dry
ending
much
better
than

and
grainy
overall

beer
drinkability
im
just
glad
i
purchased
this
in
a
mixasix
pumpkin
variety
pack
that
was
already
made
up
because
after
this
i
would
never
even
look
at
this
beer
on
the
shelf
again
a
very
lazy
example
of
a
brewer
trying
as
hard
as
possible
to
replicate
a
popular
style
of
beer
and
completley
overlooking
the
fact
that
just
adding
some
autumnal
spices
in
here
will
not
cut
it
the
aroma
isnt
too
bad
but
the
overabundance
of
allspice
in
the
actual
flavor
and
the
lack
thereof
of
any
real
pumpkin
flavors
from
the
spices
is
a
huge
letdown
an
all
right
pumpkin
beer
i
suppose
nothing
offensive
just
a
little
too
well
shock
toptasting
went
well
enough
with
the
start
of
my
reacquaintance
with
americana
midwest
style
hockey
and
hot
wings
o
decent
pumpkin
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
overall
didnt
dig
it
when
youre
making
blue
moon
harvest
moon
look
like
a
real
treat
you
know
youve
screwed
up
o
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
price
i
would
have
preferred
more
of
the
pumpkin
spice
overall
a
beer
i
would
try
again
but
was
expecting
more
of
a
kick
of
spice
out
of
the
shock
tops
probably
my
favorite
one
doesnt
touch
the
upper
echelons
of
pumpkin
greats
i
e
pumpking
weyerbachers
or
punkin
but
decent
average
and
a
good
beginner
beer
for
people
trying
their
first
pumkin
beer
as
it
is
somewhat
of
an
aquired
taste
o
not
a
bad
little
beer
from
busch
very
drinkable
brew
session
worthy
with
a
good
abv
good
favor
and
enjoyable
i
will
pick
this
one
up
again
might
even
be
a
pretty
good
gateway
beer
o
avoid
this
beer
it
could
have
been
good
or
at
least
acceptable
but
it
is
neither
blue
moon
makes
a
non
offensive
pumpkin
ale
sam
adams
makes
a
pretty
good
and
balanced
one
even
buffalo
bills
is
better
than
this
crap
sorry
shocktop
maybe
next
year
o
overall
this
does
not
stand
up
to
some
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
what
it
does
provide
is
a
mainstream
pumpkin
beer
that
will
probably
turn
on
a
lot
of
people
to
the
style
who
have
never
tried
one
before
o
not
what
i
like
in
pumpkin
beers
and
definitely
prefer
jacks
pumpkin
spice
over
this
still
its
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
definitely
nothing
like
a
wheat
though
o
this
was
surprisingly
good
theres
not
really
a
wheat
presence
but
it
is
a
nice
affordable
pumpkin
brew
could
be
one
of
those
gateway
beers
first
off
i
wanna
say
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
shock
top
in
general
but
do
do
try
every
pumpkin
beer
i
can
get
my
hands
on
so
i
thought
i
would
give
this
a
go
it
pours
a
nice
cloudy
brownish
gold
the
smell
is
surprisingly
spicy
a
nice
amount
of
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
spice
its
not
as
strong
as
some
other
pumpkin
beers
in
the
smell
department
but
it
is
a
worthy
effort
the
taste
is
also
a
surprise
this
is
a
pretyy
dang
good
pumpkin
beer
there
is
a
rush
of
holiday
spices
at
the
finish
of
this
beer
way
more
than
i
expected
this
beer
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
and
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
beers
from
shock
top
overall
an
ok
beer
certainly
not
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
but
inoffensive
and
decent
enough
to
finish
still
now
that
i
have
tasted
it
i
have
better
beers
to
drink
very
average
pumpkin
appearance
dark
honey
color
with
a
hint
of
hazelnut
color
the
smel
also
is
an
average
pumpkin
spices

nutmeg
honey
pumpkin
coriander
cinnamon
low

the
mouthfeel
is
not

this

didnt
feel
like
i
was
drinking
a
pumpkin

wish
i
had
bot
more
overall
this
definitely
has
a
kick
for
many
this
would
be
the
one
beer
for
the
entire
night
i
would
do
this
to
cap
the
night
a
very
nice
and
complex
pumpkin
ale
olower
the
abv
and
this
beer
would
be
fantastic
o
very
nice
this
is
the
second
of
averys
barrel
series
ive
had
and
while
this
is
no
tweak
its
still
very
solid
smells
much
hotter
than
it
tastes
impressive
balance
between
pumpkinroasted
malt
autumn
spices
and
bourbon
flavors
not
overpowering
despite
its
17

abv
world
class
i
am
impressed
black
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
whiskey
brownie
batter
and
vanilla
flavors
of
roasted
malt
more
brownie
batter
alcohol
and
vague
spices
a
thick
syrupy
body
with
lots
of
alcohol
burn
the
nose
is
complex
but
it
doesnt
come
together
as
well
as
it
should
seems
like
it
needs
age
but
could
be
really
nice
with
enough
time
overall
this
beer
rocks
definitely
a
sipper
but
after
taking
your
first
sip
you
want
the
experience
to
last
as
long
as
possible
this
and
good
gourd
by
cigar
city
are
the
2
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
that
prominently
incorporate
pumpkin
into
the
style
they
are
totally
different
styles
so
i
dont
want
to
compare
apples
with
oranges
but
if
you
enjoy
pumpkin
beer
styles
dont
hesitate
to
pick
this
up
picked
this
up
in
a
great
trade
with
jonathan
dark
brown
nearly
black
pour
with
a
nice
two
finger
beige
head
with
nice
retention
and
great
lacing
the
nose
is
amazing
with
huge
bourbon
and
dark
fruit
notes
along
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
raisins
molasses
cocoa
vanilla
and
oak
the
taste
is
extremely
bold
with
huge
bourbon
barrel
notes
front
and
center
tons
of
dark
fruits
especially
raisins
along
with
hints
of
molasses
dark
chocolate
oak
vanilla
toffee
maple
and
subtle
earthy
pumpkin
surprisingly
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
are
not
overpowered
by
the
booze
the
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
and
allspice
really
emerge
as
it
comes
to
temp
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
syrupy
and
extremely
rich
with
an
awesome
warming
finish
with
that
said
considering
the
17
22
abv
its
way
more
drinkable
than
expected
sure
its
definitely
a
sipper
but
no
wheres
near
as
hot
and
harsh
as
some
reviewers
made
it
out
to
be
overall
this
was
a
complex
bold
and
flavorful
beer
highly
recommended
this
is
an
awesome
beer
o
i
am
really
glad
that
i
got
to
give
this
a
whirl
and
while
it
lacks
in
subtle
grace
like
other
bba
beers
i
love
this
is
a
fun
twist
on
pumpkinspiced
beers
other
breweries
need
to
take
note
this
is
a
great
beer
the
beer
is
a
bit
boozy
but
a
great
attempt
at
a
huge
huge
bourbon
barrel
pumpkin
stout
my
first
thought
was
points
for
originality
but
the
boozy
syrupy
palateoverload
seems
to
balance
out
over
progressive
sips
definitely
a
one
of
kind
brew
a
little
more
porter
chocolate
here
but
man
oh
man
you
will
not
miss
the
fact
that
this
is
north
of
17
abv
alcohol
hot
hot
heat
dominate
though
even
sipping
it
slowly
getting
past
that
though
there
is
the
aforementioned
chocolate
and
hints
of
coffee
but
that
same
blend
of
vanilla
from
the
barrel
bleeding
into
the
vanilla
of
the
porter
and
the
creamy
sweet
of
pumpkin
meat
round
and
smoothe
once
you
get
past
the
overwhelming
alcohol
i
like
most
of
the
underlying
flavours
i
suppose
i
would
consider
laying
it
down
for
a
couple
of
years
but
i
would
worry
that
the
underlying
pumpkin
from
which
much
of
the
pleasure
derives
might
dissipate
as
it
is
its
still
far
too
hot
to
truly
enjoyappreciate
now
lots
of
tasty
complex
flavours
just
so
overshadowed
by
the
boozahol
2014
vintage
d
this
was
a
beast
of
a
brew
with
bold
and
complex
scent
and
taste
and
huge
body
all
the
flavors
really
worked
well
together
but
the
finish
was
super
hot
so
it
must
be
sipped
i
would
love
to
try
this
after
5
years
or
more
in
the
cellar
fresh
its
delicious
but
brutal
murky
brown
colored
with
no
penetration
to
light
a
faint
wisp
of
khaki
colored
head
is
present
only
around
the
rim
i
smell
plenty
of
cinnamonnutmeg
clove
and
pumpkin
pie
spice
the
taste
is
a
melange
of
bourbonnutmrlegcloveand
pumpkin
pie
spice
the
mouth
is
thickstickyand
chewy
you
can
really
taste
the
booze
in
this
a
bourbon
barrel
aged
imperial
porter
at
a
whopping
17
abv
so
strong
that
texas
retailers
required
a
liquor
license
to
sell
it
the
nose
is
all
bourbon
allspice
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
while
the
beer
is
boozy
it
is
well
hidden
by
the
creamy
malts
cinnamon
cloves
vanilla
this
is
a
pumpkin
brew
on
steroids
with
the
temps
dropping
youll
need
something
tasty
like
this
to
keep
you
warm
unbelievable
dessert
beer
crazy
all
spice
flavor
starts
out
like
hearty
fresh
baked
pumpkin
bread
not
that
saccharin
style
we
get
from
most
beers
dont
get
too
much
of
the
bourbon
but
it
does
finish
with
a
very
nice
imperial
porter
not
as
heavy
as
expected
for
a
huge
ass
beer
more
of
a
medium
body
its
smooth
syrupy
sticky
spicy
and
yes
very
sweet
at
times
cloyingly
so
but
the
warm
spice
notes
and
bourbon
keep
it
somewhat
balanced
and
earthy
especially
after
it
sits
awhile
for
such
a
sweetly
gargantuan
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
dark
cascading
head
aroma
flavor
are
heady
bourbon
mixed
with
spices
pumpkin
ale
holds
its
own
very
well
and
like
the
melding
with
bourbon
barrels
one
to
retry
for
sure
overall
a
really
huge
and
thick
brew
that
comes
out
pretty
good
huge
flavors
of
pumpkin
spice
and
bourbon
a
very
slow
sipper
that
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
the
taste
is
excellent
as
the
malt
is
the
first
thing
you
taste
yet
light
caramel
taste
with
some
dark
brown
sugar
elements
and
caramelization
from
barrel
in
the
initial
taste
too
the
flavor
of
bourbon
is
present
with
some
light
cinnamon
and
dry
clovelike
pumpkin
spice
qualities
perhaps
some
nutmeg
and
a
mild
cocoa
quality
blending
well
with
subtle
woody
taste
mid
palate
the
finish
has
a
slight
alcohol
flavor
but
mild
for
the
strength
of
the
beer
with
bourbon
and
vanilla
coming
in
with
a
slight
dessertlike
richness
i
am
truly
impressed
by
the
wonderful
barrelaged
quality
of
this
pumpkin
porter
nicely
spiced
without
going
overboard
and
asssertive
with
a
serious
amount
of
bourbon
yet
smooth
overall
and
just
incredible
considering
the
components
working
together
in
this
huge
pumpkin
ale
i
think
it
needs
six
month
in
a
cellar
to
chill
out

too
big
and
boozy
for
its
own
good
right
now
should
become
far
more
impressive
with
age
overall
good
brew
and
worth
buying
for
its
super
unique
experience
loved
every
bit
of
it
all
you
need
is
about
15
bucks
and
a
glass
salud
btw
anyone
who
claims
they
taste
pumpkin
in
a
pumpkin
beer
is
lying
pumpkin
out
of
the
can
is
pretty
much
tasteless
stop
with
the
madness
wow
this
thing
is
a
madman
at
12bottle
it
better
be
boozy
up
front
very
dark
and
rich
no
carbonation
like
a
wonderful
bourbon
syrup
reminds
me
a
lot
of
bourbon
county
stout
dont
really
get
much
spice
out
of
it
so
its
even
better
serving
type
bottle
c
i
have
to
admit
i
was
more
than
a
wee
bit
trepidatious
before
opening
this
monster
of
a
beer
but
once
i
became
resolute
it
really
isnt
all
that
scary
due
in
no
small
part
to
the
deft
hands
who
crafted
this
it
really
is
quite
porterlike
if
you
discount
the
initially
heady
pumpkin
the
spice
and
the
bourbon
character
i
know
that
sounds
fairly
spurious
given
how
big
and
varied
this
offering
is
but
overall
what
we
have
here
is
a
tasty
full
and
incredibly
warming
pumpkin
ale
great
beer
but
i
am
missing
something
it
like
balance
nice
notes
of
the
bourbon
barrel
good
porter
o
so
sweet
and
delicious
quite
complexed
a
fantastic
job
overall
i
dont
know
about
this
its
unpleasant
dark
brown
cola
looking
body
not
very
much
carbonation
at
all
smell
is
huge
bourbon
fall
spices
thick
sticky
mouthfeel
lots
of
delicious
bourbon
with
a
ton
of
pumpkin
spice
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
good
alcohol
burn
delicious
hard
to
get
through
a
whole
bottle
though
cloudy
dark
brown
in
appearance
thin
khaki
head
aromas
have
strong
tones
of
molasses
and
vanilla
along
with
pretty
apparent
booziness
and
some
spices
wow
the
flavors
are
exactly
what
it
smells
of
and
even
more
nice
complexity
not
too
much
but
still
pretty
rich
delish
the
bourbon
flavors
are
a
minimal
but
the
booziness
is
very
strong
in
the
mid
palate
great
beer
i
wish
it
was
half
the
price
or
twice
the
size
id
gladly
buy
more
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
topped
by
a
tan
head
hit
hard
by
that
male
pattern
baldness
thins
out
before
you
can
get
a
good
whiff
in
penetrating
alcohol
and
nutmegcinnamon
in
the
nose
it
could
use
some
of
that
propylene
glycol
going
down
though
realtalk
it
has
a
harsh
spice
presence
big
booze
and
little
of
the
stout
left
by
the
end
id
say
its
incrementally
more
intolerable
as
it
warms
this
beer
is
not
a
favorite
really
more
of
a
miss
than
a
hit
by
avery
as
some
others
have
mentioned
this
is
very
boozy
and
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
pumpkin
flavor
that
said
i
think
its
fantastic
for
the
sweet
and
bourbon
flavor
dark
brown
sticky
mouthfeel
flavor
profile
is
dominated
by
sweet
notes
and
bourbon
actually
there
is
no
discernible
pumpkin
beyond
faint
notes
in
the
nose
this
is
medium
to
full
bodied
it
boasts
modest
carbonation
and
overall
is
not
bad
the
barrel
and
residual
sugar
dominate
this
with
the
alcohol
being
masked
very
well
also
the
spice
additions
are
faint
smelling
pumpkin
spice
vanilla
and
pumpkinvegetable
not
getting
any
bourbon
lots
of
dark
fruitsraisin
prune
dark
cherry
chocolate
burnt
caramel
getting
a
weird
sweetness
almost
medicinal
huge
alcohol
heat
warming
my
chest
getting
better
as
it
really
warms
up
o
a
fun
pumpkin
ale
from
avery
barrel
presence
is
minimal
but
does
provide
some
complexity
pumpkin
and
spices
are
crazy
sharp
big
heavy
beer
but
alcohol
is
not
over
the
top
surprisingly
feels
like
a
big
1314er
tops
tasty
but
hard
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
it
a
sipper
for
sure
final
score
3
80
not
sure
if
it
was
the
bottle
i
got
or
not
but
the
bourbon
was
extremely
overpowering
good
for
a
random
sip
but
hard
to
finish
the
bottle
maybe
im
just
not
a
heavy
bourbon
person
or
am
less
so
than
i
thought
i
might
be
hard
to
taste
anything
but
the
bourbon
probably
heaven
for
beer
drinkers
who
like
bourbon
lots
and
lots
of
bourbon
o
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
may
have
changed
my
mind
perhaps
its
the
absence
of
actual
pumpkin
flavor
i
dont
know
a
big
beer
for
sure
at
over
17
but
drinks
rather
well
very
tasty
and
complex
the
12
price
tag
is
high
but
there
are
no
regrets
here
in
truly
decadent
fashion
this
massive
beer
doesnt
draw
out
enough
of
the
barrel
and
bourbon
as
rumpkin
drew
out
the
rum
instead
it
turns
to
a
more
complex
array
of
flavors
without
highlighting
much
of
the
pumpkin
molasses
sweetness
comes
on
hard
at
first
with
a
touch
of
syrupy
sorghum
i
taste
dark
fruits
like
prunes
but
get
a
little
fig
the
middle
is
a
bit
malty
with
some
sweet
chocolate
it
ends
a
bit
spicy
with
nutmeg
clove
and
even
some
cinnamon
all
the
while
this
is
immensely
boozy
tthis
was
the
best
porterpumkin
brew
ive
ever
had
its
a
sipper
of
deliciousness
its
very
high
abv
is
so
well
masked
it
was
pricey
but
so
glad
i
bought
one
superb
brew
a
truly
massive
beer
a
bit
too
big
for
its
own
good
even
nose
is
nothing
but
deep
syrupy
scents
of
baked
figs
molasses
and
spiced
rum
bearing
no
resemblance
to
a
porter
whatsoever
im
thinking
belgian
quad
or
bsda
initial
tastes
follow
suit
but
carry
a
slow
whiskey
burn
on
top
of
the
residual
sugars
get
past
that
though
and
the
beer
opens
up
with
notes
of
coconut
almond
and
the
toasted
darkchocolate
grain
taste
of
an
imperial
porter
along
with
just
the
slightest
notes
of
ginger
and
pumpkin
purée
overall
this
one
is
enjoyable
for
being
such
a
big
beer
but
id
give
it
at
least
another
6
months
in
the
bottle
to
mellow
out
personally
i
think
a
year
would
be
perfect
cheers
averys
barrel
pumpkin
experiments
are
fantastic
excellent
if
your
not
a
huge
pumpkin
beer
fan
as
well
pours
dark
dark
brown
with
a
more
white
than
brown
one
finger
head
wow
the
nose
is
robust
the
booze
and
the
nutmeg
are
the
first
flavors
present
followed
closely
by
vanilla
and
pumpkin
the
flavor
is
intense
it
follows
the
nose
pretty
closely
theres
heat
from
the
alcohol
but
its
flavor
is
pretty
well
hidden
much
better
than
any
other
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
monster
no
question
of
that
well
executed
but
not
really
my
thing
so
sweet
a
little
much
on
the
spice
but
ill
always
say
that
of
a
pumpkin
beer
unless
its
just
barely
detectable
and
too
boozy
the
bourbon
isnt
over
the
top
and
i
will
say
that
really
helped
this
one
ill
revisit
the
other
bottle
i
picked
up
in
a
couple
years
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
others
cannot
come
close
even
though
not
much
pumpkin
flavor
more
cinnamon
and
slight
nutmeg
sweet
flavors
blend
well
with
the
higher
abv
definatley
a
dessert
beer
for
all
you
pussies
saying
this
beer
is
hot
grow
some
sack
not
hot
by
any
means
given
the
chance
i
would
buy
up
any
bottles
available
this
beer
makes
other
pumkin
beers
taste
like
shit
poured
into
a
fremont
small
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
appearing
black
in
the
glass
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
patches
slight
lacing
rich
aroma
of
bourbon
with
light
pumpkin
pie
and
toasted
malt
kind
of
like
a
pumpkin
pie
swimming
in
bourbon
flavor
follows
with
quite
realistic
pumpkin
pie
melded
with
semisweet
dark
toasted
malt
and
lost
of
bourbon
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
light
creaminess
mild
carbonation
this
really
tastes
like
taking
a
bite
of
a
good
not
oversweet
pumpkin
pie
and
chasing
it
with
a
small
taste
of
bourbon
and
a
swig
of
sweet
stout
very
nice
not
much
fresh
pumpkin
but
the
pie
is
nailed
dessert
in
a
glass
the
bourbon
is
assertive
but
this
really
hangs
together
perfectly
with
no
component
out
of
place
ultra
abv
well
covered
delicious
and
deadly
this
might
be
the
first
avery
beer
i
have
bought
since
they
have
come
into
wisconsin
the
high
abv
the
barrel
aging
and
the
seasonal
pumpkin
taste
all
tempted
me
into
buying
this
beer
it
turned
out
to
be
fantastic
the
barrel
aging
taste
and
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
blended
together
nicely
into
a
smooth
sweet
alcoholic
treat
being
this
high
of
abv
the
beer
was
quite
a
bit
to
handle
and
has
to
be
something
you
sip
on
over
time
i
wouldnt
want
too
many
of
these
but
will
definitely
make
it
part
of
my
fall
rotation
solid
black
color
with
a
fizzy
head
on
top
that
disappears
pretty
fast
the
smell
is
awesome
bourbon
cinnamon
clove
nutmeg
the
flavor
is
intense
big
boozy
bourbon
up
front
followed
by
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
pumpkin
with
a
sweet
malt
base
the
bourbon
is
complimented
beautifully
with
pumpkin
pie
flavors
not
as
heavy
as
one
would
think
very
smooth
and
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
sipped
but
oh
so
fun
to
drink
the
price
tag
of
14
for
a
12
oz
bottle
is
very
steep
but
i
was
happy
to
try
this
uniquely
crafted
brew
once
a
huge
huge
beer
in
many
ways
whats
most
amazing
to
me
as
that
the
high
abv
is
kept
quite
manageable
tastewise
while
allowing
the
huge
dark
malt
flavors
to
coat
the
palate
with
dense
flavorful
residual
sugars
and
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
to
grace
the
taste
buds
with
its
twist
on
things
the
sweet
brown
porter
character
is
there
the
pumpkin
ale
styling
cant
be
missed
and
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
is
also
frontandcenter
a
masterful
job
of
combing
these
distinctive
flavor
profiles
into
one
approachable
and
gigantic
beer
nice
and
strong
and
if
you
like
the
bourbon
in
you
bba
beers
you
will
probably
like
this
little
too
strong
tasting
for
me
get
almost
none
of
the
barrel
and
an
alcoholbased
thin
feel
for
the
price
no
need
to
try
again
except
to
cellar
after
the
bottle
which
didnt
seem
that
different
than
my
prior
review
definitely
the
only
way
i
would
purchase
again
would
be
to
cellar
it
to
see
if
the
alcohol
burn
mellows
my
first
17
22
beer
man
was
it
strong
im
not
a
fan
of
beers
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
so
it
was
no
surprise
to
me
i
wasnt
going
to
like
this
porter
its
halloween
season
so
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
flavor
is
there
but
the
after
taste
is
too
much
for
my
taste
o
an
outstanding
pumpkin
porter
elegantly
barrelaged
and
incredibly
crafted
dont
take
a
pass
unless
youre
not
a
fan
of
the
style
serving
type
bottle
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
it
but
not
as
a
pumpkin
ale
and
more
as
a
bourbon
barrelaged
porter
definitely
prefer
this
over
rumpkin
not
fond
of
rum
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
price
for
me
if
i
happen
to
have
another
bottle
i
would
let
it
sit
for
at
least
a
year
and
half
over
the
top
abv
and
barrel
for
my
liking
bottom
line
nice
try
avery
aroma
alone
deserves
a
5
smells
like
a
pumpkin
pie
right
after
it
comes
out
of
the
oven
flavor
is
similar
with
the
warming
effect
of
bourbon
and
a
toasted
finish
exceptional
a
great
beer
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
pours
a
cola
color
with
tan
head
and
decent
retention
the
nose
is
intense
heavy
spice
and
barrel
notes
up
front
with
a
considerable
amount
of
booziness
cinnamon
is
the
strongest
of
the
spices
with
some
nutmeg
and
allspice
in
the
back
the
bourbon
barrel
brings
heavy
vanilla
and
char
the
spice
and
barrel
are
more
prominent
than
the
porter
base
hints
of
chocolate
are
present
but
are
basically
buried
the
taste
is
a
cinnamon
bomb
with
heavy
sweetness
notes
of
caramelized
pumpkin
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
barrel
char
all
come
through
the
alcohol
brings
some
warmth
to
the
finish
while
this
is
sweet
the
sweetness
is
relatively
in
check
considering
the
high
abv
overall
a
pretty
intriguing
brew
the
spice
profile
doesnt
scream
pumpkin
as
it
leans
so
heavily
to
the
cinnamon
side
of
things
i
wish
there
was
more
porter
character
here
perhaps
some
chocolate
or
roast
bottle
wow
chocolate
and
bourbon
to
the
nose
loads
of
booze
upfront
then
it
gets
the
hints
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
very
slight
clove
the
pumpkin
roundness
really
comes
in
to
cut
the
spices
before
they
get
too
harsh
tmo
taste
follows
suit
leading
with
a
big
boozy
decadent
chocolatey
bourbon
which
is
quickly
slammed
into
perspective
with
a
nice
dose
of
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
spice
my
mouth
is
left
tingling
from
the
heat
but
this
is
fairly
drinkable
for
such
a
big
brew
avery
is
one
if
the
few
who
can
pull
off
these
uber
big
beers
the
porter
flavors
are
extremely
muted
under
the
heat
and
pumpkin
but
the
char
and
roast
of
the
porter
can
be
found
beneath
another
great
brew
from
avery
i
find
that
although
a
close
rival
to
rumpkin
that
beer
stands
in
a
league
of
its
own
as
the
greatest
pumpkin
brew
of
all
time
way
to
sweet
nice
beer
but
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
the
other
bottle
i
was
able
to
obtain
mellows
out
with
time
very
alcohol
forward
as
it
should
be
at
17
22
abv
overall
really
great
effort
from
avery
as
always
for
their
barrel
aged
beers
great
beer
that
i
cannot
wait
to
taste
after
aging
it
but
rumpkin
still
takes
the
cake
for
me
and
no
pumpkin
hints
at
all
this
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
slight
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
bold
with
big
bourbon
flavors
and
malts
the
flavors
are
complex
and
bold
a
nice
boozy
flavor
that
warms
you
up
actually
the
amount
booze
i
think
actually
takes
away
from
the
flavor
of
the
beer
you
can
certainly
call
this
brew
a
slow
sipping
beer
chestnut
body
with
a
light
beige
head
aromas
of
rum
oak
fall
spices
cinnamon
boozy
spicy
squash
the
aroma
displays
a
gargantuan
alcohol
presence
but
the
finish
is
astoundingly
gentle
given
the
17
22
abv
subtle
chocolate
notes
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
sticky
on
the
palate
quite
tasty
d
the
flavor
profile
and
nose
of
this
beer
are
delectable
satisfies
the
bba
craving
more
than
the
pumpkin
flavor
it
takes
a
while
to
drink
12oz
of
this
solo
which
is
fine
because
it
really
opens
as
it
warms
for
the
super
high
abv
this
beer
is
drinkable
though
it
still
drinks
like
a
10
abv
beer
it
manages
to
be
super
sweet
but
not
cloying
does
it
need
age
to
mellow
out
i
dont
think
so
but
it
could
only
get
better
over
time
price
point
is
very
high
at
13
99
per
12oz
so
ill
buy
maybe
one
or
two
to
age
spice
cake
intense
booze
not
much
pumpkin
pumpkyn
has
a
youthful
harshness
to
it
that
will
certainly
mellow
with
time
next
year
this
will
be
a
different
beer
entirely
looks
great
a
nice
tidy
white
head
not
quite
opaque
the
color
of
a
pecan
pie
smells
like
a
glass
of
liqueur
not
bourbon
exactly
but
something
sweeter
and
more
outre
the
pumpkin
spice
flavor
comes
through
in
a
big
way
but
it
was
welcome
on
the
first
couple
of
sips
i
couldnt
taste
the
bourbon
because
it
was
so
hot
but
after
it
warmed
in
the
glass
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
an
exquisite
velvety
bourbon
flavor
that
hit
hard
at
the
beginning
and
slowly
gave
way
to
the
imperial
porters
maltiness
id
definitely
drink
this
again
if
someone
else
would
foot
the
bill
i
assume
these
bottles
are
cheaper
for
co
locals
to
buy
but
my
single
12
oz
bottle
cost
me
12
99
overall
this
was
a
powerful
and
luxurious
libation
to
enjoy
it
sips
like
hard
alcohol
so
be
prepared
and
be
careful
those
who
are
familiar
with
any
of
averys
other
offerings
should
be
well
aware
of
this
and
should
also
find
this
to
be
a
worthy
entry
into
their
catalog
for
tasting
12oz

is
much
the
same
a
really
nice
blend
of

and
bourbon

characteristics
good
stuff
very
strong
beer
lots
of
flavorbourbon
not
best
pumpkin
ive
had
good
gourd
from
cigar
city
but
worth
trying
nice
beer
for
sharing
this
is
obviously
something
special
all
of
the
big
avery
stuff
is
but
this
one
is
real
unique
as
strong
beers
and
pumpkin
beers
each
go
porter
is
a
cool
base
for
this
the
darker
grain
brings
a
lot
to
the
table
in
terms
of
flavor
depth
and
does
a
good
job
balancing
the
pumpkin
flavors
the
beer
is
a
muddy
brown
color
with
no
head
at
all
its
about
as
thick
and
syrupy
and
one
would
reasonably
suspect
but
the
texture
in
the
mouth
is
more
slippery
than
sticky
and
as
diabetic
as
this
beer
is
on
a
sugar
scale
it
doesnt
feel
teeth
rotting
in
the
end
pumpkin
flavors
are
secondary
to
the
bourbon
which
is
anything
but
subtle
sweet
vanilla
and
oak
and
indeed
some
booze
are
tasted
even
above
the
dark
malts
its
not
as
complex
as
some
others
in
the
big
barrel
series
but
i
think
its
integrated
all
the
elements
really
well
my
issue
here
is
than
i
can
have
about
4
ounces
of
this
and
i
need
to
move
on
its
too
sweet
and
strong
for
much
drinking
and
i
think
a
more
robust
yeast
strain
would
have
taken
this
thing
well
over
20
abv
given
the
remaining
residual
sugars
overall
a
must
try
all
of
these
are
but
maybe
one
i
wouldnt
buy
again
by
virtue
of
its
absurdity
this
is
an
unbelievably
boozy
beer
i
love
averys
barrel
program
but
this
one
wasnt
quite
up
to
par
its
hot
and
sweet
and
the
spices
are
present
but
get
lost
in
the
background
do
to
the
booziness
i
will
let
this
beer
age
for
quite
a
while
before
trying
my
second
bottle
all
this
being
said
i
will
be
first
in
line
to
buy
their
next
barrel
release
not
really
much
pumpkin
flavor
not
the
best
offering
for
the
style
one
of
the
better
blue
moon
seasonals
ive
had
so
nicely
balanced
in
its
spices
and
drinkability
that
it
gives
some
of
the
more
recent
shock
top
offerings
ive
had
honey
bourbon
cask
wheat
lemon
shandy
a
run
for
their
money
really
good
fall
time
beer
watch
the
leaves
turn
color
and
drink
this
beer
below
average
pumpkin
ale
for
the
style
can
live
without
this
one
doesnt
have
the
great
pumpkin
flavor
you
would
expect
from
this
seasonal
brew
admittedly
i
dont
care
for
pumpkin
beers
and
i
only
drank
this
to
help
a
friend
empty
out
his
beer
fridge
but
this
still
wasnt
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
not
a
bad
pumpkin
brew
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
lacks
on
spice
and
too
sweet
we
like
the
fact
that
the
hops
dont
take
over
the
flavor
profie
good
drinking
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
this
pumpkin
ale
smells
great
if
not
a
tad
artificial
on
the
pumpkin
taste
is
good
but
not
enlightening
points
off
for
weak
head
lack
of
body
and
overcarbonation
overall
this
is
just
a
pretty
weak
beer
its
not
terrible
in
any
particular
aspect
but
it
is
just
completely
mediochre
or
less
in
every
way
the
aroma
is
not
very
strong
the
taste
seems
slightly
off
the
beer
seems
a
little
too
watery
perhaps
ive
definitely
had
worse
pumpkin
ales
but
you
could
do
much
better
than
this
brew
has
a
great
dark
taste
of
spices
and
pumpkin
great
reason
why
i
love
the
fall
season
but
this
beer
isnt
too
great
in
hot
weathers
this
is
not
a
pumpkin
ale
maybe
they
added
pumpkin
maybe
they
forgot
to
add
it
to
the
batch
maybe
a
hint
of
spice
tastes
like
a
basic
brown
ale
to
me
not
bad
though
its
good
but
not
what
im
looking
for
in
the
fall
smooth
and
relaxing
not
bad
for
the
money
not
as
good
as
pumking
but
it
has
its
qualities
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
certainly
had
worse
but
had
much
better
too
solid
pumpkin
beer
that
doesnt
do
much
yet
doesnt
suck
enjoyed
this
smooth
pumpkin
ale
this
was
good
but
not
the
bests
i
would
buy
a
6
on
sale
not
a
12
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
i
wouldnt
rush
out
and
get
some
of
this
there
are
definitely
better
choices
but
with
good
availability
and
an
above
average
beer
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
it
if
i
was
craving
the
pumpkin
taste
in
the
fall
a
regular
tasting
pumpkin
ale
not
impressive
mixed
six
from
publix
a
really
smooth
pumpkin
beer
unfortunately
points
off
for
being
a
coors
product
serving
type
bottle
blue
moon
harvest
moon
pumpkin
ale
brewed
by
coors
brewing
company
this
brew
has
an
abv
of
5
70
harvest
moon
pumpkin
ale
pours
out
of
the
bottle
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
smell
is
rich
with
pumpkin
and
spices
you
also
pick
up
on
some
grains
and
sweetness
in
the
smell
of
this
brew
at
first
the
the
taste
is
bold
with
flavor
it
puts
you
in
mind
of
pumpkin
pie
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
a
lot
of
bold
flavor
with
a
nice
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
bold
and
clean
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
brew
over
all
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
25
out
of
5
coors
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
not
an
over
the
top
beer
by
any
means
but
worthy
of
a
try
the
flavor
evokes
pumpkin
without
overwhelming
the
malt
overall
its
an
ok
pumpkin
beer
quite
predictable
have
it
at
a
party
but
spend
your
money
on
anderson
valley
uinta
or
shipyard
tastes
like
double
crooked
tree
with
a
hint
of
pumkin
and
spice
orangish
color
decent
pumpkin
flavor
not
the
strongish
flavor
in
the
pumpkin
ales
somewhat
sweet
sweet
and
crisp
830
pours
consistent
clean
amber
very
low
foam
light
buttery
pumpkin
nose
faint
taste
is
a
fake
sickly
sweet
pumpkin
pie
cookie
no
bite
whatsoever
did
they
add
sugar
to
this
terribly
sweet
all
out
of
balance
not
good
drain
pour
the
verdict
its
ok
an
average
pumpkin
ale
the
flavor
seems
to
disappear
quickly
as
it
warms
love
this
beer
spicy
and
flavorful
without
being
overwhelming
and
the
pumpkin
flavor
comes
through
without
being
cloying
or
artificial
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
content
is
perfect
to
take
the
chill
out
of
the
air
on
those
brisk
autumn
afternoons
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
macro
beers
its
refreshing
sweet
and
super
drinkable
the
flavors
are
powerfully
pumpkiny
and
spicy
to
the
point
of
coming
across
as
artificial
but
artificial
in
the
way
that
candy
and
instant
ramen
taste
artificial
comforting
and
familiar
it
feels
like
a
treat
to
drink
this
on
a
hot
day
and
i
wish
it
was
more
widely
available
outside
of
autumn
an
okay
seasonal
for
being
a
millercoors
product
i
was
surprised
at
the
differences
between
the
rating
items
the
brew
had
a
great
appearance
except
it
had
no
head
staying
power
the
aroma
wasnt
altogether
great
but
the
mouthfeel
was
velvety
almost
for
the
most
part
not
a
notable
beer
but
not
bad
either
average
pumpkin
beer
its
very
easy
to
find
and
cheap
and
tastes
good
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
was
average
drinking
straight
from
the
bottle
first
pumpkin
ale
ive
drank
good
pumpkin
flavor
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palette
the
hops
compliment
the
pumpkin
flavor
very
nicely
this
pairs
well
with
chocolate
like
drinking
a
chocolate
pumpkin
muffin
overall
a
decent
fall
beer
really
pours
a
light
orange
with
a
fizzy
head
the
smell
was
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
pumpkin
on
the
end
the
taste
had
pumpkin
and
some
spice
but
compared
to
other
pumpkin
beers
its
quite
thin
overall
it
was
okay
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
options
this
year
for
good
pumpkin
beers
overall
3
13
this
was
a
nice
beer
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
but
in
winter
time
for
some
strange
reason
im
getting
this
feeling
of
holding
a
girl
for
the
first
time
on
one
of
the
first
chilly
nights
of
autumn
for
a
beer
to
recreate
that
is
simply
awesome
the
taste
is
spicy
and
bland
but
theres
something
there
thats
telling
my
brain
that
this
is
a
good
brew
i
recommend
it
taste
sweet
spicy
and
pumpkiny
spicy
flavor
also
tends
to
the
nutmeg
and
cloves
thin
and
somewhat
cloying
spiced
aroma
pours
bright
copper
orange
with
full
white
head
slight
lacing
of
glass
taste
is
mild
lightly
spiced
hint
of
caramel
no
hops
no
bitterness
refreshing
but
could
use
more
pumpkin
in
the
mash
final
thoughtsbetter
than
2013s
version
but
lacks
with
keeping
the
taste
staying
fresh
good
blend
of
spices
for
the
fall
i
found
this
to
be
an
exceptionally
bad
beer
i
had
a
twelve
pack
with
coworkers
and
no
one
finished
a
bottle
its
now
july
and
still
have
some
in
the
fridge
because
we
cant
give
it
away
also
note
that
michelobe
ultra
was
an
option
often
chosen
over
this
it
tastes
like
the
greatpumpkin
took
a
crap
in
glass
of
millerlight
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
if
you
were
in
the
market
for
a
really
good
pumpkin
beer
id
look
elsewhere
not
bad
the
smell
is
slightly
better
than
the
taste
but
not
by
much
the
nutmeg
is
very
clear
in
the
smell
the
taste
of
pumpkin
is
light
but
theres
a
definite
bite
to
the
drink
with
spices
im
impressed
although
i
wouldnt
probably
get
it
again
i
am
impressed
from
this
blue
moon
offering
pours
a
pretty
amber
in
color
with
about
a
1finger
off
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
on
the
light
side
and
is
of
pumpkin
and
spices
the
taste
is
actually
very
pleasant
with
the
spices
and
you
can
taste
the
cloves
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
as
well
as
the
pumpkin
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
good
carbonation
for
this
one
that
wasnt
overdone
overall
better
than
some
other
pumpkin
ales
that
i
tried
and
liked
this
one
aroma
is
a
bit
light
on
spice
and
pumpkin
taste
is
very
clean
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
and
spice
the
wheat
body
is
notable
and
melds
well
with
the
pumpkin
and
spice
overlay
a
bit
more
fullerbodied
than
i
had
expected
overall
not
knocked
out
by
this
rather
toneddowned
and
overlyclean
seasonal
ale
certainly
palatable
and
quite
good
but
not
optimal
for
those
seeking
a
more
robust
pumpkin
ale
overall
decent
pumpkin
ale
from
the
big
boys
o
not
a
bad
offering
by
coors
i
can
see
where
this
would
appeal
to
someone
drinking
a
pumpkin
beer
for
the
first
time
would
do
in
a
pinch
although
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
when
drinking
a
pumpkin
ale
kind
of
a
meh
beer
poured
a
bit
cold
with
a
small
to
medium
size
creamcolored
head
that
soon
settled
to
a
large
island
and
ring
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
somewhat
lighter
orange
amber
with
loads
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
beer
malt
and
a
little
pumpkin
flavors
like
nose
with
carbonic
tang
dominating
on
the
dry
side
and
leans
to
bland
body
is
controlled
by
over
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
which
is
short
lived
but
has
the
long
lingering
tang
one
thing
i
like
is
the
underplaying
of
the
pumpkin
flavor
but
they
went
too
far
forgettable
overall
not
a
lot
of
complexity
but
has
the
proper
mix
of
spices
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
beive
had
worse
this
season
pours
a
orange
amber
with
a
decent
head
litte
lace
the
smell
is
spice
a
little
wheatish
and
sweet
malt
taste
has
a
little
more
pumpkin
to
it
then
the
smell
and
u
can
taste
the
sweet
malt
with
a
pie
spice
blend
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
then
expected
and
has
just
a
touch
of
sting
overall
is
pretty
good
and
prob
the
best
seasonal
from
blue
moon
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
anything
pumpkin
i
was
somewhat
ambivalent
about
trying
this
ale
but
i
was
glad
i
did
the
pumpkin
and
allspice
were
lurking
behind
nicely
balanced
hops
and
malt
i
dont
know
if
id
enjoy
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
before
reaching
pumpkin
pie
overload
but
its
certainly
a
nice
seasonal
choice
o
this
was
great
at
first
strong
pumpkin
first
but
quickly
becomes
overwhelming
i
recommend
trying
this
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
as
its
got
the
strongest
pumpkin
flavor
of
any
beer
ive
tried
to
good
health
and
good
beer
overall
not
too
bad
i
dont
think
ive
ever
been
disappointed
with
a
blue
moon
you
know
what
your
going
to
get
with
them
quality
but
nothing
overly
special
or
anything
to
go
crazy
over
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
if
you
want
something
for
after
a
meal
or
just
something
for
the
fall
season
i
would
recommend
this
brew
any
pumpkin
lover
will
like
this
fact
nice
flavor
off
the
bat
full
rich
aflood
with
spices
cinnmon
ginger
cardamom
riding
on
top
of
the
palate
smooth
and
malty
little
hops
medium
body
and
ulimately
fading
nice
balance
decent
taste
but
id
prefer
a
little
more
then
again
this
is
coors
behind
the
helm
who
arent
normally
in
the
business
of
challnging
tastebuds
not
bad
for
blue
moons
version
of
a
pumpkin
beer
ive
certainly
had
better
but
this
wasnt
the
worst
o
is
it
a
pumpkin
pie
not
quite
is
it
a
well
crafted
balanced
beer
no
is
it
perfect
for
a
bonfire
party
or
wellpriced
backup
autumn
beer
heck
yes
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
orangecopper
coloring
with
a
slow
flow
of
carbonation
and
a
scant
filmy
white
coating
of
head
that
quickly
settles
out
into
a
ring
aromas
of
roasted
pumpkin
earthy
notes
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spice
hints
of
vanilla
and
a
touch
of
sweet
potato
cant
really
fault
anybody
so
far
on
this
beer
flavors
are
where
things
start
to
go
awry
syrupy
and
sugary
sweet
forward
flavors
of
pumpkin
come
at
you
hamhanded
with
an
almost
instant
cloying
the
spice
characters
are
completely
drowned
out
and
the
roast
notes
dont
stand
a
chance
in
balancing
this
beer
out
i
guess
the
saving
grace
is
that
the
flavor
is
almost
completely
gone
from
your
palate
in
a
matter
of
seconds
the
aftertaste
is
almost
nonexistent
with
hints
of
toasted
grain
and
a
linger
of
sugary
sweetness
oily
slick
body
which
helps
expedite
the
disappearance
of
this
beer
from
your
palate
leading
to
an
empty
finish
that
i
suppose
will
be
deemed
clean
this
one
started
off
alright
but
the
drop
off
was
dramatic
gave
this
another
shot
and
i
think
they
have
nailed
the
formula
for
this
one
now
had
a
great
balance
of
smell
taste
and
drinkability
with
that
warm
feeling
you
want
to
get
form
the
beers
in
the
cold
weather
give
this
one
a
try
overall
a
decent
and
rather
easy
drinking
pumpkin
ale
that
is
very
accessible
and
rather
affordable
o
decent
pumpkin
brew
worthy
of
a
try
poured
an
almost
bright
orange
amber
with
a
thin
ring
of
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
to
nothing
leaving
no
lacing
the
same
look
of
every
other
pumpkin
ale
scents
of
pumpkin
pumpkin
pie
spices
that
i
cannot
accurately
separate
and
sweetness
its
a
typical
sweet
pumpkin
ale
scent
taste
is
sweet
with
prominent
pumpkin
and
the
same
undifferentiated
pumpkin
pie
spices
but
with
some
slight
undertones
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
some
caramel
malt
flavors
throughout
and
a
bit
of
wheat
cracker
on
the
finish
with
a
toasted
malt
aftertaste
not
bad
but
a
bit
sweet
like
most
pumpkin
ales
the
wheat
cracker
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
flavor
profile
of
an
otherwise
standard
pumpkin
ale
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
about
what
i
expected
from
a
pumpkin
ale
overall
its
a
standard
pumpkin
ale
with
all
the
good
and
bad
that
comes
with
the
style
it
manages
to
separate
itself
slightly
due
to
the
addition
of
wheat
malt
but
its
not
enough
to
raise
it
above
its
a
pumpkin
ale
status
this
is
an
above
average
pumpkin
ale
with
a
nice
maple
and
brown
sugar
finish
o
its
an
ok
pumpkin
beer
good
enough
for
its
price
tag
o
this
beer
just
average
it
doesnt
try
anything
new
i
would
say
it
is
a
good
starter
pumpkin
beer
for
someone
who
has
never
had
one
before
there
isnt
really
anything
wrong
with
the
beer
as
it
tastes
like
a
run
of
the
mill
dark
beer
instead
of
crafting
a
pumpkin
beer
as
a
new
recipe
it
would
appear
that
the
beer
is
a
clone
of
an
existing
product
with
a
bunch
of
spices
thrown
in
ok
so
i
am
no
beer
supreme
abbot
but
at
least
i
know
what
i
like
when
i
taste
it
and
harvest
pumpkin
ale
is
a
solid
and
respectably
well
tasting
brew
with
lots
of
midrange
appeal
sure
its
not
as
aggressive
compared
to
others
in
this
style
range
but
it
doesnt
have
to
be
you
want
pumpkin
its
there
you
want
spice
its
there
you
want
to
drink
a
ale
that
fits
well
within
the
constructs
of
a
golden
sunny
day
with
the
family
in
a
farm
picking
harvest
fare
during
a
crisp
october
or
november
day
culminating
in
those
libra
skys
the
autumn
is
known
for
its
all
there
in
my
humble
beerpinion
are
there
better
representative
brews
of
this
style
of
course
but
they
might
be
off
putting
and
too
aggressive
for
most
making
an
entry
into
craft
beer
those
who
are
looking
to
test
their
taste
buds
in
pumpkin
aleville
will
find
no
injustice
here
and
perhaps
may
discover
a
gateway
to
more
complex
offerings
as
palates
evolve
blue
moon
harvest
pumpkin
ale
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
the
best
but
good
enough
to
make
you
taste
the
festiveness
of
the
season
and
it
offerings
overall
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
but
too
thin
and
not
flavorful
enough
to
really
contend
with
higher
quality
craft
beers
12oz
bottle
from
a
6er
poured
into
a
tulip
for
full
aroma
not
much
of
a
head
and
what
did
stick
around
was
very
soapy
has
a
nice
copper
color
however
first
prominent
aroma
is
that
of
a
homemade
pumpkin
pie
with
obviously
plenty
of
spices
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
are
huge
in
the
taste
but
dont
overpower
the
beer
i
do
enjoy
the
nutyness
that
this
one
packs
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
but
i
dont
expect
anything
else
with
the
label
blue
moon
on
it
overall
a
nice
fall
brew
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
one
but
dont
pass
on
it
either
httpyoutu
bepozlhbi0f0
just
your
average
run
of
the
mill
pumpkin
ale
nothing
real
special
here
and
no
real
pumpkin
taste
this
is
from
blue
moon
which
is
a
wannabe
craft
beer
made
by
miller
coors
had
to
try
it
taste
is
very
faint
mouth
feel
is
a
little
bitter
but
not
bad
smell
is
very
faint
almost
not
there
overall
blue
moon
did
not
put
forth
a
huge
effort
on
this
beer
but
when
do
they
really
o
of
the
few
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
had
this
is
my
favorite
the
other
two
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
prior
to
this
one
were
shipyards
pumpkin
head
and
brooklyns
post
road
pumpkin
ale
feels
like
drinking
pumpkin
pie
quite
enjoyable
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
a
couple
of
these
in
one
sitting
i
wouldnt
need
to
have
this
beer
available
yearlong
but
would
look
forward
to
its
arrival
each
year
overall
a
very
welcome
surprise
from
blue
moon
i
think
of
them
and
i
see
the
scores
on
here
and
was
expecting
something
very
ordinary
what
i
got
instead
was
a
very
enjoyable
sixpack
that
i
will
probably
buy
again
before
they
go
out
of
season
after
trying
this
beer
in
a
restaurant
i
bought
a
6
pack
it
must
have
been
from
an
entirely
different
batch
this
time
the
pumpkin
and
spice
aroma
was
very
strong
and
the
flavor
was
extremely
sweet
and
syrupy
carbonation
was
almost
non
existent
and
it
poured
up
with
no
head
at
all
maybe
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
not
sure
but
now
i
am
hesitant
to
even
open
the
remainder
however
i
will
in
order
to
give
this
beer
a
third
chance
final
thoughts
ive
tried
and
homebrewed
many
pumpkin
beers
and
have
come
to
a
few
conclusions
about
the
style
the
first
is
that
there
are
a
few
different
types
of
pumpkin
beers
with
blue
moons
harvest
pumpkin
ale
falling
into
the
spiced
pumpkin
category
as
opposed
to
the
pumpkin
puree
or
pumpkin
pie
group
the
second
thing
ive
realized
based
on
personal
taste
is
that
a
pumpkin
beer
is
either
excellent
or
decent
ive
just
never
had
a
bad
one
thats
why
for
me
harvest
pumpkin
ale
falls
in
line
with
many
other
decent
pumpkin
beers
it
drinks
like
a
pedestrian
attempt
and
the
style
which
is
just
fine
because
its
good
id
definitely
recommend
this
one
to
any
amber
ale
drinkers
looking
to
broaden
their
horizons
would
i
drink
it
again
yep
one
of
the
only
blue
moon
products
i
can
say
that
about
pours
burnt
orangeamber
with
a
thin
khaki
head
which
disappears
quickly
watery
pumpkin
aroma
with
hints
of
allspice
and
cinnamon
slightly
artificial
smelling
in
the
taste
you
get
more
of
that
watery
pumpkin
hints
of
cinnamon
are
in
there
as
well
but
thats
about
it
lots
of
carbonation
here
way
too
much
the
carbonation
overwhelms
the
majority
of
the
notes
what
little
there
are
blue
moon
actual
make
some
alright
brews
but
this
one
could
use
a
tune
up
overall
enjoyable
but
ive
tried
better
pumpkin
beers
overall
a
solidlyaverage
pumpkin
i
would
get
it
again
kinda
nice
to
have
a
decent
one
that
isnt
huge
alcohol
to
drink
for
football
games
and
holiday
get
togethers
the
feel
is
okay
its
a
little
thin
in
the
body
but
its
crisp
without
being
too
crisp
and
has
a
bit
of
smoothness
pulling
through
its
getting
cooler
the
bears
are
losing
definitely
pumpkin
beer
season
this
one
pours
a
clear
auburn
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
graham
cracker
light
cinnamon
and
light
clove
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
slight
underlying
vein
of
stale
gingerbread
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
a
decent
enough
little
pumpkin
beer
though
not
something
i
could
see
drinking
many
of
no
matter
how
bad
the
bears
are
doing
the
appearance
of
blue
moon
harvest
moon
pumpkin
ale
is
a
clear
dark
orange
with
minimal
head
and
not
a
lot
of
lacing
it
smells
of
a
slight
pumpkin
spice
with
a
hint
of
smokey
cinnamon
in
the
aftertaste
its
just
an
average
pumpkin
ale
but
has
some
hops
to
it
as
well

the

maybe
i
just
dont
care
for

but
id
pass
on
this
if
it
ever
comes
my
way
again
o
overall
a
decent
beer
worth
a
revisit
maybe
next
year
overall
try
it
once
maybe
it
is
powerfully
sweet
doesnt
even
really
resemble
beer
all
that
much
i
think
they
sweetened
the
recipe
this
year
because
i
dont
remember
it
being
that
strong
last
year
either
way
i
wont
buy
it
again

i
really
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
fall
flat
it
definitely
blew
my
expectations
out
of
the
water
this
is
an
average
pumpkin
beer
i
would
recommend
many
other
over
this
one
but
this
one
works
for
tailgates
and
hanging
around
the
campfire
a
way
overly
spiced
pumpkin
beer
in
my
opinion
on
tap
at
dave
and
busters
this
one
pours
a
nice
amber
shade
with
a
faint
orange
glow
and
a
fleeting
off
white
head
the
nose
is
nutmeg
and
clove
a
little
vanilla
and
red
and
caramel
malts
no
squash
to
speak
of
the
same
is
true
of
the
flavor
where
the
heavy
spice
dose
totally
crowds
out
any
real
pumpkin
thats
in
this
beer
its
very
desserty
like
a
pumpkin
pie
seasonally
okay
but
to
me
id
like
to
see
more
of
the
actual
pumpkin
all
the
spice
makes
it
a
tough
beer
to
session
even
though
the
body
is
just
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
good
its
not
a
bad
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
and
definitely
better
than
some
of
the
other
blue
moon
seasonals
but
ive
come
to
like
my
pumpkin
beers
to
showcase
the
vegetable
not
the
spice
and
this
one
is
just
too
spice
based
for
me
others
may
disagree
serving
type
bottle
o
for
a
twist
off
cap
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
im
not
buying
that
they
use
real
pumpkin
from
vines
but
it
is
a
nice
artificial
pumpkin
pie
flavor
with
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
and
blandness
overall
i
dont
think
i
would
serve
this
at
a
party
but
might
be
a
nice
addition
to
halloween
sampler
o
blue
moon
nails
it
on
the
head
with
their
harvest
pumpkin
ale
as
a
gateway
craft
brewery
their
beers
appeal
to
those
looking
to
expand
beyond
the
light
fizzy
swill
into
something
with
more
flavor
and
presence
pumpkin
ales
can
be
daunting
at
times
as
not
everyone
cares
for
the
gourd
but
blue
moon
succeeded
in
making
an
approachable
fall
seasonal
which
neither
excels
nor
fails
instead
this
beer
is
completely
content
to
revel
in
its
mediocrity
ok
i
will
say
it
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
for
a
few
reasons
it
seems
to
have
a
more
balanced
taste
than
a
few
others
the
pumpkin
and
spices
do
not
overwhelm
the
beer
flavor
and
vice
versa
another
factor
is
the
price
12
99
for
a
12
pack
is
joy
in
a
box
it
tastes
good
and
not
over
priced
i
will
buy
more
and
stock
pile
to
get
my
fix
for
the
winter
overall
too
much
wheat
and
little
pumpkin
for
me
its
also
too
sweet
the
spices
are
generic
and
this
beer
feels
like
its
brewed
from
a
massive
company
oh
this
was
my
first
try
at
a
pumpkin
beer
amber
color
lit
pumpkin
smell
head
was
thick
enough
to
float
the
cap
finish
with
the
taste
of
pumpkin
spice
nice
finish
with
no
bitter
after
taste
just
like
a
nice
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
not
to
bad
for
a
beer
from
the
big
breweries
overall
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
but
nothing
special
o
well
it
was
decent
the
body
hurts
the
flavor
and
the
carbonation
can
come
off
as
intrusive
at
times
so
while
i
still
havent
found
that
wonderful
pumpkin
ale
im
always
happy
to
review
and
know
about
a
brew
though
its
far
from
terrible
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
or
buy
i
wont
go
into
the
yuppy
classifications
astmo
if
you
want
pretentiousness
check
google
i
will
keep
it
unadulteratingly
real
this
beer
is
goodquality
pumpkin
not
the
best
but
drinkable
and
worth
the
money
spent
i
have
a
bigger
problem
with
the
assclowns
trying
to
act
like
like
they
know
what
good
beer
is
fuk
em
and
fuk
em
good
o
a
good
if
unremarkable
seasonal
beer
certainly
a
solid
choice
to
serve
at
an
autumn
gathering
though
drinkability
suffers
somewhat
on
account
of
the
spicy
aftertaste
it
seems
to
lack
some
of
the
complexity
in
flavor
that
makes
other
seasonal
brews
so
enjoyable
while
the
flavors
that
do
emerge
can
tend
to
be
overpowering
particularly
in
the
aftertaste
i
wouldnt
refuse
one
of
these
beers
if
handed
to
me
but
given
a
cooler
full
of
options
i
might
dig
around
in
the
ice
for
a
while
before
grabbing
one
of
these
overall
not
really
impressed
this
was
simply
just
a
seasonal
flavor
added
to
a
coors
like
all
of
the
other
blue
moon
beers
at
least
thats
what
i
think
i
really
want
to
like
the
blue
moon
brews
i
think
they
need
to
be
more
origanal
with
their
brews
and
it
might
be
better
overall
definitely
an
average
pumpkin
ale
the
pumpkin
isnt
quite
as
dominating
in
this
beer
as
in
most
pumpkin
ales
which
is
kind
of
a
nice
change
however
there
just
isnt
really
anything
there
to
take
its
place
its
not
bad
but
its
nothing
id
seek
out
regularly
nice
fall
beer
o
this
beer
is
no
exception
to
my
distaste
of
pumpkin
ales
but
i
always
try
to
give
newer
ones
a
fair
go
id
really
like
it
if
the
spice
was
almost
overwhelming
buckeyenation
got
it
right
tastes
like
it
was
brewed
by
coorsand
it
was
i
sampled
this
beer
along
with
another
similar
choice
new
holland
ichabod
ale
and
found
it
average
there
was
a
hint
of
smell
and
taste
of
pumpkin
and
had
a
mild
sweetness
to
it
less
evident
than
the
ichabod
ale
the
bottle
presentation
was
average
at
best
too
probably
wont
go
looking
for
this
one
next
season
years
ago
before
coors
took
completely
over
when
this
ale
was
produced
in
tenn
i
seem
to
remember
a
fuller
pumpkin
ale
flavor
now
it
seems
to
be
a
little
watered
down
nothing
terreble
just
nothing
exciting
this
pumpkin
ale
seems
to
be
better
as
an
introduction
to
the
style
basically
for
anyone
who
is
a
not
a
beer
need
o
not
a
particularly
good
beer
but
not
awful
major
problems
were
with
the
sticky
mouthfeel
and
the
heavy
spices
not
something
you
could
drink
a
few
of
in
a
row
but
it
still
lacks
the
heartiness
of
a
good
porter
or
stout
like
the
rest
of
blue
moons
offerings
its
an
attempt
to
make
beer
palatable
to
the
widest
possible
audience
making
it
the
safest
least
offensive
lowestcommondenominator
beer
you
will
find
in
other
words
its
the
nickelback
of
beer
its
drinkable
but
thats
the
nicest
thing
i
can
bring
myself
to
say
about
it
o
a
decent
fall
seasonal
beer
kind
of
reminds
me
of
leinies
oktoberfest
enjoy
by
the
campfire
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
copper
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
at
a
moderate
pace
there
are
some
visible
tiny
bubbles
in
the
beer
i
detect
faint
aromas
of
those
pumpkin
pie
spices
cloves
allspice
and
nutmeg
i
get
some
of
the
malt
in
the
smell
as
well
there
is
some
mild
pumpkin
flavor
in
the
beer
and
i
get
the
malt
with
just
some
of
those
pumpkin
pie
spices
everything
about
the
flavor
is
mild
but
this
is
certainly
more
of
a
malty
pumpkin
ale
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
this
is
an
average
beer
and
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
pours
a
hazy
burnt
orange
moderate
cap
of
offwhite
foam
gone
quickly
pale
notes
of
grain
blend
with
mild
pumpkin
and
firm
seasonal
cinnamon
clove
and
ginger
taste
very
light
mild
notes
of
pumpkin
and
spice
on
a
weakly
malted
base
beer
fizzy
light
not
one
of
the
best
representations
of
a
pumpkin
ale
simply
a
weak
fizzy
beer
with
a
splash
of
the
season
o
the
aroma
and
drinkability
give
this
beer
a
slightly
above
average
rating
otherwise
its
a
standard
pumpkin
ale
rjt
overall
an
average
to
slightly
above
average
pumpkin
ale
the
doughiness
adds
a
different
dimension
to
this
one
yet
it
is
nothing
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
i
would
get
this
again
or
just
as
well
pass
overall
an
average
pumpkin
brew
good
for
drinking
at
thanksgiving
dinner
o
decent
enough
autumn
beer
but
not
complex
or
rich
enough
to
be
considered
anything
special
a
dumbdowned
version
of
a
craft
fall
seasonal
about
what
i
expected
from
bm
overall
id
rate
this
as
a
decent
fall
beer
id
prefer
a
bit
more
spiciness
and
pumpkin
flavor
though
overall
drinkability
another
pumpkin
ale
that
is
just
average
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
not
something
i
would
be
able
to
drink
every
week
or
with
a
meal
come
to
think
about
it
it
is
a
tasty
beer
that
is
meant
to
be
drank
alone
and
enjoyed
in
the
fall
of
the
year
o
this
isnt
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
because
it
has
a
good
amount
of
aromas
and
flavors
that
dont
taste
artificial
and
is
easy
to
drink
o
not
the
worst
pumpkin
beer
that
i
have
had
but
nothing
special
either
easy
to
drink
and
i
enjoy
the
fact
that
the
spices
are
not
too
dominant
and
it
is
not
overly
sweet
o
this
is
an
average
pumpkin
beer
ill
drink
the
rest
but
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
the
beer
pours
a
waterclear
amber
orange
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
and
some
chillaxing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
there
was
a
nice
cream
head
after
the
pour
but
it
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
light
fringe
of
lacy
cream
white
bubbles
but
a
swirl
of
the
glass
does
rejuvenate
a
fourth
of
a
finger
of
head
the
beer
smells
light
pumpkin
aroma
underlying
with
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
cloves
there
is
a
ghost
of
a
wheat
malt
spice
and
some
roasted
malts
that
oddly
wet
the
nose
at
the
back
of
the
smell
but
other
than
that
this
beer
is
all
spice
and
pumpkin
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
alcohol
that
burns
at
the
nose
which
i
find
odd
for
such
a
low
alcohol
beer
the
beer
tastes
bitterly
fruity
with
pumpkin
and
the
flavor
eating
bite
of
the
spices
which
leave
a
slight
spiceburn
tingle
on
the
tongue
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
in
terms
of
spices
and
there
are
no
real
surprises
hear
the
pumpkin
tastes
a
little
unripe
on
the
tongue
and
leaves
a
bitter
bite
on
the
aftertaste
that
i
associate
with
unripe
fruit
very
faint
hints
of
spice
are
found
from
the
wheat
and
a
weird
syrupy
sweet
flavor
actually
clotted
my
tongue
for
a
brief
moment
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
smooth
with
only
a
faint
bite
from
the
carbonation
and
a
dryyetdamp
feeling
is
left
after
the
beer
leaves
my
mouth
is
pretty
damp
with
saliva
but
my
tongue
feels
a
little
dry
and
sandpapery
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
pumpkin
beer
it
is
definitely
a
pumpkin
beer
which
is
good
but
it
carries
some
of
the
hallmarks
of
massbrewing
and
suffers
for
it
the
beer
could
have
a
better
mouthfeel
and
a
riper
feel
to
the
pumpkin
flavor
worth
a
sip
if
you
like
pumpkin
beer
but
i
would
pickup
a
shipyard
pumpkinhead
over
this
if
i
was
looking
for
an
easily
accessible
pumpkin
beer
to
try
a
middle
of
the
road
pumpkin
ale
the
appearance
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
the
nose
is
kind
of
confused
the
taste
is
good
but
boring
and
the
body
is
a
bit
light
but
ive
actually
had
worse
pumpkin
ales
from
legit
micros
so
coors
should
feel
kinda
good
about
themselves
on
this
one
id
drink
this
before
id
drink
other
pumpkins
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
as
expected
with
loads
of
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
is
very
similar
the
pumpkin
notes
are
present
as
is
come
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
there
is
also

bottle
into

with
a
quickly
receding
half
finger
of
head
leaves
no

smells
of
pumpkin
pie
pumpkin
pie
crust
slight
cinnamon
and
slight
ginger
the
taste
is
of
straight
pumpkin
crust
with
a
good
dose
of
ginger
thrown
into
the
mix
only
thing
missing
is
the
whipped
cream
the
mouthfeel
keeps
the
mentioned
flavors
however
the
nutmeg
comes
through
and
dominates
over
the
rest
of
the
flavors
over
all
this
was
a
delicious
beer
that
would
pair
up
well
with
thanksgiving
dinner
hell
even
my
girlfriend
liked
it
overall
tastes
nearly
identical
to
the
apple
caramel
ale
though
this
one
gets
slightly
higher
marks
for
tasting
somewhat
akin
to
the
name
and
description
given
definite
pie
crust
flavors
that
the
latter
had
but
the
hints
of
pumpkin
come
out
slightly
better
than
the
apple
and
caramel
character
thats
supposedly
in
the
other
beer
truth
be
told
if
i
did
a
blind
taste
test
i
believe
id
have
a
hard
time
differentiating
between
the
two
poured
out
into
a
pint
glass
this
pumpkin
ale
is
crystal
clear
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
semi
thick
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
caressed
by
a
good
layer
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
i
picked
up
some
cloves
pumpkin
spices
all
spice
cinnamon
figs
and
raisins
it
has
a
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
and
leans
more
toward
light
its
crisp
and
sharp
tasting
throughout
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
its
mildly
bitter
but
the
spices
come
out
as
it
travels
towards
the
back
of
your
throat
as
it
hits
the
midsection
of
your
tongue
you
can
taste
the
spices
and
cloves
by
the
time
it
hits
the
back
of
your
mouth
the
cloves
allspice
and
cinnamon
are
more
present
this
beer
maintains
its
crispness
throughout
and
is
very
pleasant
overall
but
the
flavors
could
be
a
bit
more
present
damn
beautiful
burnt
orange
look
and
tanish
2
finger
head
amazing
after
taste
but
not
what
is
advertised
better
than
advertised
for
my
taste
pallet
love
the
fact
that
it
is
seasonal
only
and
i
do
look
forward
to
it
on
that
account
the
mouth
feel
is
almost
like
a
warm
pumpkin
pie
setteling
in
your
mouth
best
blue
moon
product
someone
at
the
brewery
must
have
fallen
asleep
there
is
no
hint
of
spice
in
the
aroma
of
this
ale
there
is
no
taste
or
even
hint
of
spices
in
this
ale
tastes
like
a
brown
ale
what
happened
here
its
okay
for
a
brown
but
when
the
label
says
pumpkin
ale
this
didnt
deliver
i
emailed
them
the
batch
number
from
my
bottle
o
a
good
beer
for
a
fall
gettogether
that
has
a
variety
of
beer
tastes
inclinations
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
they
tried
to
keep
it
sweet
without
going
too
overboard
on
the
pumpkin
flavor
not
terrible
but
doesnt
compare
to
southern
tier
or
dogfish
heads
version
drinkability
the
bear
is
repeatable
and
easy
to
drink
due
to
its
alcohol
level
but
id
suggest
finding
a
better
exemplar
of
this
style
all
in
all
its
a
pretty
pedestrian
brew
theres
not
much
pumpkin
here
and
what
there
is
tastes
like
baby
food
its
not
really
objectionable
but
its
at
the
lower
end
of
acceptable
just
ok
not
a
fan
of
most
pumpkin
beers
to
begin
with
and
this
is
average
even
by
those
standards
o
pleasantly
surprised
not
a
ton
of
raw
pumpkin
flavor
but
a
nice
seasonal
brew
overall
its
a
good
seasonal
brew
that
gets
you
into
that
fall
state
of
mind
oreally
nothing
special
here
if
you
want
a
pumpkin
beer
look
somewhere
else
this
one
is
pretty
boring
i
agree
with
the
other
reviews
not
the
best
pumpkin
out
there
lackluster
is
a
more
fitting
description
it
felt
like
it
was
trying
to
be
a
ginger
ale
which
not
a
beer
at
all
technically
its
crafted
as
a
cider
as
ginger
cannot
be
brewed
its
too
delicate
its
extract
can
only
be
added
as
an
afterflavor
to
a
traditional
beer
hence
ginger
ale
nonetheless
this
sucks
i
recommend
a
listen
of
eric
dolphys
iron
man
from
his
lp
entitled
illinois
concert
to
go
with
this
punkin
ale
overall
this
did
not
really
even
taste
like
a
pumpkin
ale
which
was
rather
disappointing
o
this
one
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
has
a
great
flavor
to
it
could
use
a
little
more
pumpkin
flavor
but
thats
my
only
issue
with
this
one
served
this
pumpkin
ale
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
white
head
retention
is
average
and
theres
is
some
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
color
of
this
ale
is
a
very
nice
copper
color
it
looks
very
appealing
the
aroma
is
faint
some
light
malt
slight
suggestions
of
pumpkin
and
some
slight
spice
notes
come
through
the
taste
of
this
ale
is
medium
body
smooth
easy
to
drink
there
is
a
caramel
malt
base
with
some
slight
hints
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
slightly
dry
finish
this
pumpkin
ale
is
decent
there
are
much
better
examples
available
o
overall
i
cant
even
score
this
average
because
unfortunately
it
does
not
rank
with
average
beers
its
not
bad
as
a
beer
individually
and
would
be
good
as
a
midway
between
a
light
lager
and
something
like
a
brown
ale
unfortunately
it
does
not
stack
up
if
a
person
is
looking
for
a
pumpkin
beer
big
thanks
goes
out
to
one
of
my
buddies
from
college
for
this
tick
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
redorange
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
pumpkin
clove
and
cinnamon
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
pumpkin
cinnamon
wheat
and
nutmeg
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
average
brew
you
can
tell
what
they
were
going
for
with
this
one
based
on
the
aroma
and
flavor
here
however
they
just
seemed
to
fall
a
little
short
for
my
liking
while
the
flavors
were
okay
in
this
one
they
just
seemed
a
little
diluted
also
the
nutmeg
aspect
i
got
in
this
one
was
definitely
not
needed
at
all
and
might
have
helped
this
brew
out
if
it
were
not
present
glad
i
got
to
tick
it
for
free
as
i
wouldnt
have
been
happy
had
i
bought
it
o
so
many
better
options
on
the
market
if
youre
looking
for
a
pumpkin
beer
or
an
octoberfest
this
is
just
kinda
there
overall
im
glad
i
didnt
spend
my
own
money
on
this
i
really
enjoy
the
different
take
brewers
have
with
pumpkin
ale
as
noted
above
im
a
little
disappointed
with
this
version
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
if
you
can
do
without
flavor
since
i
enjoy
flavor
in
my
pumpkin
beer
ill
stick
to
dogfish
head
weyerbacher
or
smuttynose
versions
when
im
looking
for
solid
rendition
of
the
style
with
that
said
ill
have
to
serve
the
remaining
beers
to
guests
who
dont
know
the
difference
between
a
really
good
and
not
so
good
pumpkin
ale
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
lightbodied
and
plain
i
dont
get
much
pumpkin
taste
in
this
at
all
a
boring
mess
from
coors
this
pretty
much
just
tastes
like
coors
light
with
a
bit
of
vegetable
and
vine
nothing
special
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
unremarkable
this
is
more
of
a
belgian
wit
with
touch
of
pumpkin
spice
and
doesnt
stand
up
to
some
of
the
fullflavored
pumpkin
ales
that
are
popular
this
time
of
year
o
not
bad
from
the
blue
moon
lineup
a
nice
beer
to
try
for
who
likes
the
macro
brewers
better
than
the
original
blue
moon
wheat
maybe
because
its
fall
overall
they
really
need
to
amp
up
the
flavors
in
this
one
as
it
is
its
very
unremarkable
and
not
a
very
good
representation
of
a
seasonal
pumpkin
ale
o
id
avoid
next
time
o
average
nothing
great
but
it
is
as
good
as
any

top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
of
lace
drip
back
down
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
pumpkin
puree
and
some
subdued
pumpkin
pie
spices
taste
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
smell
but
the
spices
are
more
assertive
here
this
beer
has
a
very
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
i
wasnt
expecting
very
much
and
for
what
it
is
i
was
impressed
o
this
beer
is
horrid
i
would
recommend
this
to
not
one

not
even
my
worst
enemy
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
moderate

not
the
smoothest
drinking

even
when

overall
a
very
average
pumpkin
beer
nothing
insulting
about
it
but
just
plain
o
about
as
expected
a
buddy
get
this
to
me
to
try
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
sixer
onot
a
great
pumpkin
ale
but
acceptable
for
the
price
and
for
being
a
macro
brews
shot
at
a
micro
brew
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
tip
of
the
cap
to
coors
for
trying
i
have
drank
this
one
over
the
years
and
thought
it
was
a
great
offering
for
the
season
now
that
i
have
seen
the
light
its
just
an
average
brew
not
tasting
much
of
the
pumpkin
that
i
had
anticipated
it
has
a
great
color
and
good
carbonation
and
is
a
great
session
type
beer
but
has
a
hight
abv
of
5

that
was
a
nice
surprise
for
a
lower
price
six
pack
theres
not
much
to
blue
moons
pumpkin
ale
which
is
about
what
i
expected
easily
quaffed
but
as
flavor
goes
its
in
the
bottom
tier
of
pumpkin
brews
orange
with
a
smallish
head
that
had
decent
retention
smell
was
watery
as
was
the
taste
reminds
me
of
regular
blue
moon
with
some
attempt
at
pumpkin
spices
this
is
certainly
not
a
pumpkin
ale
for
craft
beer
geeks
i
really
cant
think
of
any
reason
to
ever
drink
this
again
unless
the
last
two
choices
in
the
world
are
between
blue
moon
and
blue
moon
pumpkin
m
the
mouthfeel
is
nondescript
the
spices
never
get
too
strong
the
ale
provides
enough
diversion
though
a
brief
interlude
this
has
a
sourish
taste
there
is
some
underlying
spice
and
brown
sugar
but
this
is
essentially
an
ale
with
some
attempt
at
being
a
pumpkin
ale
really
this
tastes
like
a
blue
moon
the
regular
witbier
with
a
hint
of
spice
its
not
bad

its

the
taste

not

i
would

here
overall
not

for

near

overall
id
definitely
buy
a
12
pack
im
not
really
a
wheat

fan
but
because
it
was
a
wheat
pumpkin
ale
i
figured
that
i
would
try
it
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
and
had
a
difficult
time
tasting
anything
that
resembled
pumpkin
it
tasted
waterdown

something
im
not
sure
but
i
was

like

was
only

at
local
grocery
store
so
not
a
terrible
purchase
better
than
buffalo
bills
pumpkin
ale
which
seems
to
get
a
lot
of
love
overall
i
have
to
give
this
pretty
high
marks
relative
to
some
standard
pumpkin
ales
its
easy
drinking
with
nothing
offensive
and
just
enough
meat
for
the
fall
overall
probably
the
least
enjoyable
pumpkin
beer
ive
tried
to
date
pumpkin
taste
is
nonexistent
the
typical
pumpkin
pie
spices
are
minimal
and
out
of
balance
the
only
redeming
qualities
are
the
beers
appearance
and
the
mouthfeel
o
overall
this
really
isnt
worth
the
buy
if
id
known
id
already
had
this
i
would
have
held
off
o
doesnt
have
enough
pumpkin
flavor
for
me
to
buy
again
but
if
you
like
a
beer
on
the
sweeter
side
its
not
a
bad
overall
really
they
would
do
better
if
they
named
it
something
other
than
pumpkin
because
it
has
good
flavor
just
not
the
pumpkin
o
not
a
good
pumpkin
no
depth
no
complexity
no
taste
really
just
bland
and
not
something
i
would
buy
again
stone
o
actually
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
not
really
able
to
notice
pumpkin
flavor
considering
the
brewery
i
surprisingly
enjoyed
it
but
really
would
not
consider
this
a
pumpkin
beer
o
i
feel
like
this
beer
would
be
much
better
received
if
it
wasnt
labeled
as
a
pumpkin
beer
if
it
were
just
blue
moon
harvest
ale
and
just
contained
spices
i
wouldnt
have
had
many
problems
with
it
because
it
does
that
nicely
for
its
pricebrewery
overall
i
like
this
beer
quite
a

id
definitely
get
it
again

this
offering
i
will
definitely
try
others
this

to
see
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
ill
happily
drink
the

of

with

the

dry
on

there
were
noticeable
amounts
of

there
the
flavor
was
what
surprised
me
it
was
a
very
clean
taste
that
was
smooth
on
the
tongue
i
suppose
there
was
a
little
pumpkintype
spiciness
in
the
flavor
but
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
paired
this
up
with

seemed
to
bring

nothing
is
really
wrong
either
slightly
below
average
as
a
pumpkin
brew
overall
but
drinkable
enough
adrsep
24
but
firmly
i
was
satisfied
with
this
brew
too
much
rum
not
enough
else
too
sweet
too
much
yam
apparently
my
rating
of
1
for
taste
is
an
outlier
in
terms
of
flavor
id
have
to
describe
it
as
overwhelmingly
the
best
beer
i
ever
tasted
exceptional
but
too
expensive
and
rare
basically
i
loved
it
but
wish
i
could
have
it
again
disappointing
as
i
had
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
years
this
definitely
has
potential
perhaps
some
age
will
mellow
it
out
not
a
fan
of
the
style
which
could
lead
to
the
lower
rating
too
much
rum
came
through
and
not
enough
barrel
flavor
didnt
detect
the
nutmeg
or
cinnamon
either
this
is
so
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
it
to
be
with
loads
of
molasses
toffee
and
cane
sugar
kicking
my
teeths
in
finished
off
wih
an
intense
alcoholic
burn
while
the
barrels
woodenness
gets
almost
swallowed
entirely
by
the
sugar
the
malt
foundations
gets
overpowered
by
the
sweetness
already
during
the
very
beginning
joined
by
a
sharp
alcoholic
impact
and
only
manages
to
try
finding
its
balance
during
a
later
stage
due
to
the
calming
herbs
and
spices
which
all
in
all
arent
capable
to
stop
the
sugar
madness
too
the
rum
barrel
is
very
well
integrated
though
providing
a
burning
slightly
bitter
counterpart
to
the
sugar
which
would
result
into
a
slightly
dry
medicinelike
impression
if
it
wasnt
for
the
muddy
leafy
herbs
of
mace
cardamon
and
vanilla
to
provide
some
sort
of
balance
finishes
with
caramelized
malts
among
molasses
and
an
confirming
booziness
leaving
enough
space
on
the
palate
for
the
actual
pumpkin
to
fit
in
supported
by
wooden
herbs
aroma
of
abv
pumpkinyam

vanilla

other
spices
butterscotch

sweet
malty

abv

overall
there
should
be
a
warning
label
on
this
beer
for
diabetics
it
is
good
but
holy
crap
the
its
like
drinking
a
pint
of
syrup
this
is
a
sweeter
beer
to
be
sure
it
also
shows
its
power
a
bit
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
a
sweeter
beer
you
can
save
your
money
if
you
like
real
pumpkin
beers
and
arent
dissuaded
by
the
previous
sentence
give
this
a
try
at
least
once
beware
its
likely
a
slow
sipper
based
on
its
abv
and
sweetness
t
blast
of
sour
mash
and
green
apple
up
front
with
sweet
rich
notes
of
rum
and
bourbon

that

first

and
holy
sweet
pumpkin
batman
after
i
got
past
the
initial
diabetic
shock
and
let
it
warm
the
taste
follows
the
nose
if
you
were
to
caramelize
some
pumpkin
in
butter
with
brown
sugar
and
then
deglaze
it
with
a
dfh
120
that
is
pretty
much
the
flavor
you
get
from
this
beast
excellent
mouth
feel
and
hardly
any
booze
burn
though
halfway
through
the
glass
my
equilibrium
can
definitely
detect
the
booze
excellent
brew
sweet
almost
like
a

12oz

id
heard
about
this
beer
for
years
and
finally
capitulated
to
the
high
price
to
start
off
it
looks
like
shit
tons
of
sediment
mixed
throughout
what
would
have
been
a
pretty
beer
aroma
is
this
strange
melange
of
pumpkin
spice
and
booze
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
spices
pumpkin
and
booze
my
first
couple
sips
had
me
ready
to
pour
it
out
but
it
grew
on
me
and
i
finished
my
glass
still
this
one
is
not
for
me
very
good
and
pleasant
beer
definitely
worth
putting
one
or
two
to
cellar
this
brew
is
a
deep
dark
amber
smells
of
alcohol
a
fruity
sweetness
the
initial
taste
mirrors
that
smell
with
dark
molasses
roasted
pumpkin
flavors
that
is
followed
up
by
a
boozy
shot
of
cinnamon
other
spices
i
think
the
rum
adds
a
slight
warming
into
the
finish
despite
the
high
abv
popping
through
this
is
a
very
tasty
pumpkin
offering
that
yall
need
to
go
pickup
good
brew
to
sip
next
to
the
firepit
after
sundown
super
hot
full
of
sugar
and
sweetness
i
split
this
12
oz
beer
and
i
m
glad
i
did
full
of
flavor
not
any
pumpkin
at
all
but
tons
of
sugary
goodness
should
have
aged
this
beer
to
let
it
cool
down
wont
have
again
but
if
you
like
boozy
ba
beers
andor
pumpkin
beers
you
cant
go
wrong
this
has
got
to
be
the
cream
of
the
crop
for
you
3
75
i
cant
get
into
the
beers
that
are
this
hard
as
much
as
id
like
though
it
could
be
a
good
enough
sipper
for
sure
rum
and
pumpkin
what
more
do
you
need
had
high
expectations
but
taste
was
too
sweet
and
miserable
an
amazing
pumpkin
beer
every
time
i
drink
it
i
find
something
else
i
didnt
notice
before
seriously
need
to
buy
it
when
you
see
it
it
will
be
off
the
shelf
very
shortly
wow
avery
avery
avery
avery
how
did
you
do
this
a
boozy
rum
soaked
pumpkin
ale
sounds
like
a
gimmick
on
paper
but
this
beer
is
a
watershed
in
the
big
beer
category
amazing
top
notch
world
class
beautiful
this
is
definitely
a
brewing
accomplishment
but
not
one
im
sure
needed
to
be
accomplished
its
just
too
much
for
the
sake
of
being
too
much
it
does
taste
good
for
about
2
oz
or
so
3
415
not
elegant
but
a
solid
falltime
dessert
beer
i
shared
this
with
some
friends
and
that
is
perfect
for
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
to
amber
color
with
no
head
aroma
is
huge
alcohol
almost
mediciny
also
get
some
fruity
esters
and
vanilla
along
with
just
a
slight
rum
hint
the
taste
is
super
sweet
like
dark
molasses
on
the
front
end
with
some
nice
lingering
pumpkin
and
spice
notes
alcohol
is
very
present
the
mouthfeel
was
hot
and
a
little
oily
feeling
but
in
a
nice
way
super
tasty
beer
i
havent
had
a
bad
barrelaged
beer
from
avery
yet
had
this
as
a
thanksgiving
digestif
a
few
hours
after
the
main
course
and
dessert
i
am
hoping
to
get
another
bottle
to
age
for
next
year
it
was
excellent
fresh
but
i
believe
that
it
has
the
potential
to
be
epic
with
some
age
on
it
2014
batch
fridge
temp
into
a
snifter
and
allowed
to
warm
this
is
an
extremelybordering
on
obscenelysweet
beer
like
it
should
carry
a
warning
for
diabetics
theres
very
minimal
alcohol
heat
and
the
rum
is
quite
muted
except
for
the
degree
to
which
it
contributes
to
the
again
extraordinary
sweetness
as
it
warms
a
bit
of
complexity
begins
to
emerge
most
notably
in
the
form
of
an
almost
bacony
aftertaste
which
is
a
good
thing
overall
this
is
very
tasty
but
its
a
bit
onedimensional
and
lacking
the
complexity
i
get
from
the
truly
worldclass
barrelaged
offerings
o
pretty
fine
beer
if
you
do
rum
do
this
on
tap
at
ginger
man
nyc
first
sip
was
too
sweet
next
two
or
three
less
so
by
the
fourth
sip
i
was
on
board
complex
flavor
that
balanced
the
high
alcohol
perfectly
rum
i
caught
hints
which
is
exactly
what
made
this
a
perfect
beer
to
me
full
of
subtle
flavors
that
kept
me
going
back
and
discovering
more
with
each
taste
big
and
boozy
nice
rum
notes
that
didnt
overpower
the
pumpkin
really
good
just
doubt
i
could
afford
more
than
a
couple
serving
type
bottle
ill
revisit
it
after
its
aged
a
bit
for
me
fresh
this
beer
was
super
hot
boozy
and
overly
sweet
i
enjoyed
the
spice
and
pumpkin
aroma
and
flavor
but
the
sweetness
was
overpowering
for
me
hopefully
in
time
it
ages
into
a
wonderful

of

pumpkin
sweetness
brown

woody
notes
tangy

and
a

are

characteristic
of

leading
the

followed
by
an
immediate
blast
of

both
in

woody
and

come
through
in
highlights
as
well
as

this
thing
is
a
beast
slick
oily
robust
bodied
with
a
huge
warming
factor
as
you
drink

is
surprisingly
light
on

and
more
of

with
the

great

this
beer
is
fantastic
the

nothing
like
the
average
pumpkin
beer
although
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
much
more
than
1
at
a
setting
this
would
be
perfect
around
the
campfire
on
a
cool
fall
night
this
years
batch
they
call
18
5
i
believe
it
not
quite
revolting
but
the
8
oz
glass
was
more
than
the
two
of
us
could
get
through
as
during
that
illadvised
nightcap
in
metro
denver
the
bristling
threat
of
this
offering
not
necessary
to
detail
here
look
it
up
or
read
a
label
seems
to
just
bleed
away
once
you
dive
in
with
both
feet
large
fully
of
bloated
pumpkin
pie
barleywineesque
malt
and
actually
polite
rum
barrel
booze
whats
not
to
like
especially
when
its
drinking
this
well
this
soon
whoa
as
billed
the
2014
rumpkin
is
a
big
hit
of
rum
followed
by
a
mellow
pumpkin
flavor
great
right
away
and
cannot
wait
to
see
how
it
ages
overall
what
it
all
comes
down
to
is
this
this
brew
as
expensive
as
it
is
an
absolute
delight
worth
every
penny
and
worth
the
trouble
looking
for
it
it
is
literally
dessert
in
a
glass
already
one
of
my
top
three
pumpkins
salud
an
overthetop
pumpkin
ale
styling
that
punches
your
senses
with
a
heavy
sweetness
there
is
so
much
sugar
action
going
on
that
it
does
a
good
job
of
hiding
the
high
abv
definitely
unbalanced
with
the
huge
sweetness
but
it
does
offer
a
rather
varied
array
of
flavors
although
the
pumpkin
aspect
is
pretty
lowkey
for
the
adventurous
take
pumpkin
pie
and
banana
bread
smash
together
and
add
a
healthy
splash
of
oak
aged
booze
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
tasted
sweet
boozy
spicy
i
almost
wish
it
was
snowing
while
i
drink
this
on
tap
on
tapwerks
in
an
8
oz
snifter
dark
redamber
caramel
color
with
very
little
head
produced
very
sweet
aroma
of
rum
caramel
and
cinnamon
the
taste
is
interesting
very
sweet
at
the
start
with
caramel
candy
flavors
slight
cinnamon
nutmeg
banana
bread
vanilla
and
cane
sugar
rum
flavors
definitely
some
alcohol
warmth
but
surprisingly
not
boozy
as
this
warms
up
its
gets
way
too
sweet
and
cloying
to
point
of
being
unpleasant
mouthfeel
is
sticky
full
and
cloying
towards
the
finish
overall
its
good
especially
at
first
but
way
too
sweet
towards
the
end
plenty
of
rum
flavor
and
sweet
candy
sugar
but
it
becomes
too
much
and
even
at
8
oz
it
was
hard
to
finish
id
have
it
again
but
id
prefer
an
even
smaller
portion
82100
more
of
a
spirit
less
of
a
beer
plenty
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
moderate
rum
tasty
but
very
sweet
the
rum
is
a
nice
touch
thick
mouthfeel
glad
i
tried
5
oz
of
it
today
i
enjoyed
it
but
not
as
much
as
other
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
this
season
at
13
to
12
as
much
alcohol
just
fantastic
it
is
simply
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
the
sweetness
of
the
rum
barrel
perfectly
goes
with
the
pumpkin
flavoring
the
high
alcohol
is
totally
masked
making
this
an
extraordinarily
enjoyable
drink
pumpkyn
is
also
good
but
this
is
on
another
planet
this
beer
is
no
joke
its
high
abv
is
very
noticeable
it
burns
in
a
good
way
look
for
it
trade
for
it
if
you
like
a
stout
thats
sweet
with
a
high
abv
youll
love
this
final
score
3
71
o
a
real
nice
pumpkin
ale
rum
barrels
seem
to
consistently
bring
pineapple
to
mind
for
me
this
beer
brings
savory
vegetals
and
tropical
fruits
together
in
a
smooth
fashion
sure
to
please
fans
of
big
boozy
pumpkin
ales
be
warned
it
is
a
beast
of
a
killer
brew
tastes
the
same
extremely
rich
sweet
and
boozy
sticky
sweet
caramel
marzipan
oaky
vanilla
toasted
plantains
low
carb
with
astringent
booze
though
extremely
sweet
the
flavor
profile
is
one
im
partial
to
its
pretty
similar
to
samaels
overall
it
is
what
it
is
tastes
and
smells
pretty
nice
though
not
much
in
the
way
of
distinctive
rumpumpkin
elements
overly
sweet
could
harld
drink
a
taste
of
it
the
taste
is
excellent
with
a
nice
pumpkin
quality
and
slight
clovelike
spice
and
mild
caramel
intertwined
with
a
subtle
spicy
cinnamon
woodiness
with
the
rum
barrels
mild
molassess
and
toasted
character
with
woody
undertones
and
spicy
presence
of
alcohol
there
is
a
good
amount
of
pumpkin
sweetness
and
malt
in
the
taste
but
pretty
rum
barrel
dominant
as
it
warms
with
spiced
flavor
and
alcohol
into
the
finish
overall
a
great
blend
of
a
strong
ale
with
spice
and
the
pumpkin
quality
still
noticeable
in
the
taste
with
rum
enjoyable
as
an
enhancement
to
the
base
not
bad
but
i
kind
of
wish
i
sat
on
the
bottle
bottle
i
got
to
let
the
heat
subside
got
better
the
more
i
drank
and
was
a
very
nice
sipper
on
a
cool
night
overall
though
too
boozy
for
me
may
mellow
with
some
age
not
a
big
pumpkin
beer
fan
but
this
is
very
good
crazy
sweet
though
really
want
to
try
the
porter
bourbon
version
o
this
beer
is
absolutely
delicious
i
drank
half
the
bottle
at
a
temperature
of
59f
it
could
have
a
been
cooler
initially
but
was
still
stunning
the
booze
is
subdued
for
something
so
strong
yet
its
clear
you
are
drinking
a
huge
beer
an
in
your
face
cornucopia
of
fall
flavors
with
subdued
spices
thanks
ruckusdu
for
the
2013
version
and
i
cannot
recall
the
source
of
the
older
bottle
but
thanks
go
out
to
whomever
shared
it
with
me
if
indeed
i
got
it
from
a
trade
taste
is
really
smooth
unbelievably
so
actually
cinnamon
dusted
pumpkin
pie
with
a
floater
of
meyers
dark
rum
damn
i
didnt
realize
this
beer
was
as
good
as
it
is
fantastic
more
like
a
liqueur
than
a
beer
but
the
dark
fruits
know
no
bounds
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
need
to
get
more
of
for
sure
and
kicking
myself
for
waiting
so
long
to
try
it
well
done
avery
im
fully
impressed
with
this
beer
and
found
that
it
truly
responded
to
warmth
it
has
a
lot
of
complexity
and
is
very
delicious
definitely
sweet
the
sugary
pumpkin
and
rum
mingle
well
together
esters
balance
nicely
keeping
the
beer
drinkable
o
this
beer
is
very
sweet
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
finish
one
bottle
by
myself
should
have
split
this
with
someone
it
took
me
about
2
hours
to
drink
the
thing
after
a
while
thought
it
really
grew
on
me
maybe
i
was
just
getting
drunk
an
interesting
beer
that
im
really
going
back
and
forth
on
a
lot
of
aspects
of
the
flavor
but
ultimately
its
just
too
sweet
for
me
to
really
find
it
outstanding
and
i
generally
love
sweet
beers
like
wee
heavys
and
english
barleywines
12
oz
bottle
enjoyed
this
on
thanksgiving
day
with
a
slice
of
pecan
pie
and
also
pumpkin
pie
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
minimal
head
smells
incredible
spiced
rum
spices
caramel
malt
tasteswhoa
the
high
abv
is
not
hidden
at
all
but
still
has
amazing
flavors
pumpkin
pretty
subtle
spiced
rum
dominates
finishes
hot
i
shared
the
bottle
which
was
a
good
idea
perfect
end
to
a
huge
thanksgiving
day
meal
and
paired
very
well
with
dessert
im
just
not
really
sure
how
to
describe
what
i
was
tasting
was
like
drinking
a
really
thick
mulled
cider
lots
of
rum
cloves
cinnamon
and
alcohol
burn
not
very
smooth
and
i
dont
really
feel
like
the
flavors
complimented
each
other
glad
i
was
given
the
opportunity
to
try
this
but
dont
really
feel
l
need
another
possibly
would
be
better
with
aging
i
first
had
this
beer
at
fobab
in
2012
and
recalled
adoring
it
this
was
my
first
chance
to
revisit
it
and
im
hoping
it
becomes
an
annual
thing
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
enough
if
youre
a
fan
of
big
spicysweet
yam
and
pumpkin
beers
i
do
wish
id
enjoyed
one
at
the
height
of
the
autumn
months
this
would
be
an
absolute
gem
on
a
crisp
autumn
day
othere
was
no
need
for
this
high
of
alcohol
rum
barrel
aging
was
a
good
idea
but
it
threw
off
the
balance
bottle
share
at
proof
courtesy
of
scotchzi
opaque
orangey
amber
zero
head
but
who
cares
aroma
reminds
me
of
hot
cider
spice
cinnamon
clove
sweet
almost
burnt
sugar
and
pumpkin
replaces
the
apple
but
there
is
a
touch
of
baked
apple
too
taste
is
very
similar
but
a
warm
spiced
rum
comes
through
too
thinmedium
body
with
almost
no
carbonation
but
who
cares
extremely
well
thought
out
brew
and
yummy
as
hell
maybe
my
new
favorite
pumpkin
alcohol
burn
is
all
im
getting
a
sweet
sugary
mess
batch
3
bottle
that
i
picked
up
in
san
diego
for
13
99
better
be
good
part
of
a
2man
tasting
alongside
good
gourd
almighty
and
almanac
heirloom
pumpkin
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
orange
without
much
head
aroma
of
spiced
rum
pumpkins
a
little
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
and
light
butterscotch
a
little
pumpkin
fruit
light
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spice
brown
sugar
a
bit
of
marshmallow
cream
the
sweetness
is
very
nice
here
alcohol
warmth
is
like
whoah
as
expected
sweet
not
quite
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
medium
to
low
carbonation
overall
i
like
this
a
lot
and
it
is
a
huge
improvement
over
the
disappointment
that
was
good
gourd
almighty
that
we
had
right
before
this
one
o
ridiculously
huge
and
over
the
top
i
love
it
an
easy
sipper
like
a
fine
cognac
or
cordial
it
really
is
sweet
to
the
point
of
being
cloying
but
it
just
works
here
this
is
the
biggest
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
come
across
and
one
of
the
most
unique
i
look
forward
to
its
release
every
year
makes
for
a
nice
slow
dessert
sipper
o
one
wild
ride
of
a
beer
it
is
thick
deep
and
complex
in
every
area
i
have
to
give
avery
some
respect
for
making
this
so
drinkable
for
how
big
this
beer
is
it
is
also
pretty
amazing
just
how
much
pumpkin
and
spice
cuts
through
the
booze
and
rum
artfully
done
and
like
nothing
else
on
the
market
the
taste
is
a
bit
muddled
and
maybe
a
bit
overly
sweet
but
with
that
being
said
i
would
not
hesitate
to
pick
another
up
for
a
special
occasion
like
thanksgiving
dinner
sit
down
strap
in
and
let
rumpkin
take
you
on
the
outer
bounds
of
what
beer
is
deep
copper
to
brown
in
color
i
see
definite
evidence
of
alcohol
from
rum
barrel
aging
in
the
cloudiness
of
this
beer
the
head
was
minimal
and
quickly
vanished
after
the
pour
the
aroma
is
of
dark
rum
and
perhaps
dark
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
thickchewyand
warm
with
alcohol
i
get
dark
rum
on
the
front
of
the
palate
i
get
some
sweetness
and
body
from
the
pumpkin
i
also
get
some
definite
warming
in
my
throat
from
the
alcohol
while
you
can
tell
there
is
abundant
alcoholi
would
not
have
guessed
what
i
see
listed
on
the
bottle
o
in
the
same
vein
as
a
lot
of
the
bigger
ba
avery
beers
although
i
think
this
works
better
in
terms
of
restraining
the
booziness
and
sugar
compared
to
say
uncle
jacobs
stout
or
the
shelf
beers
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
at
common
table
much
more
rum
beer
than
pumpkin
beer
in
smell
and
especially
taste
smooth
mouthfeel
for
such
high
alcohol
content
sweetness
masked
any
alcohol
burn
for
me
however
the
sweetness
grew
to
a
nearly
intolerable
level
before
the
bottle
was
halfway
finished
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
but
far
far
too
sweet
to
order
again
overall
really
an
interesting
beer
lots
of
oak
and
rum
lead
the
way
but
the
mild
pumpkin
and
spices
shine
brilliantly
in
the
background
the
body
is
sticky
and
similar
to
a
liqueur
but
is
much
easier
drinking
than
one
sweet
and
delicious
this
is
a
wonderful
sipper
for
autumn
o
really
interesting
take
on
a
pumpkin
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
think
it
could
have
used
another
year
or
so
of
aging
as
it
was
still
a
little
hot
but
still
a
pleasant
heat
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
its
super
alcoholic
and
more
rum
beer
than
pumpkin
beer
for
sure
im
buzzed
just
from
my
share
of
this
12
oz
bottle
yikes
this
is
potent
not
a
whole
lot
of
positive
flavors
and
a
serious
alcohol
burn
not
one
id
drink
again
and
i
struggled
to
finish
off
the
bottle
with
my
friend
who
said
it
seemed
more
appropriate
for
drinking
down
by
the
railroad
tracks
overall
this
was
great
lots
of
complexity
big
abv
and
very
tasty
cant
wait
to
see
what
some
aging
does
o
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
that
i
could
see
a
good
after
dinner
drink
it
manages
to
have
some
nice
rum
presence
without
being
too
boozy
nice
to
have
on
a
cool
fall
night
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
i
was
expecting
a
boozy
mess
but
the
rum
really
complements
the
pumpkin
aspect
of
the
beer
the
rum
obviously
makes
the
beer
very
sweet
the
best
way
i
can
describe
the
beer
is
that
its
like
a
firestone
walker
double
dba
on
steroids
mouthfeeloverall
the
body
on
this
beer
is
quite
big
as
you
would
expect
and
all
of
that
carbonation
does
not
show
quite
as
much
on
the
palate
oddly
enough
a
bit
on
the
syrupy
side
extreme
alcohol
burn
on
the
back
end
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
was
very
excited
to
get
ahold
of
and
try
it
certainly
lived
up
to
expectations
on
a
number
of
levels
very
flavorful
and
a
good
fall
beer
in
the
end
though
the
abv
for
this
style
is
just
too
high
for
me
making
this
a
quintessential
sipper
and
a
bit
hard
to
get
through
half
of
this
12oz
bottle
would
have
been
sufficient
for
me
definitely
worth
a
try
though
o
glad
to
have
tried
this
extreme
beer
avery
seems
to
push
the
envelope
more
than
most
good
times
wickedly
big
rum
barrel
pumpkin
pie
molasses
brown
sugar
cinnamon
ginger
dense
pumpkin
bread
really
good
would
be
a
task
to
take
down
12oz
but
a
task
i
would
welcome
definitely
on
the
sweet
end
with
a
tingling
rum
finish
perfect
for
11am
on
a
friday
good
beer
for
a
cool
fall
evening
not
sure
its
worth
the
price
or
one
i
could
drink
often
but
definitely
glad
to
try
the
body
is
rather
light
than
i
prefer
as
well
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
i
suppose
the
bodys
gotta
be
as
is
due
to
the
high
abv
doesnt
come
close
to
almanacs
but
still
a
great
pumpkin
ale
to
enjoy
during
the
cold
fall
and
winter
months
o
its
a
big
abv
beer
but
has
some
very
great
sweet
flavors
that
fit
this
time
of
the
year
well
the
whole
is
a
greater
sum
of
its
parts
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
love
the
drinkability
considering
the
very
high
abv
o
an
great
beer
unique
and
flavorful
it
drinks
very
easily
i
genuinely
did
not
know
its
strength
definitely
in
the
dessert
beer
category
but
it
has
been
quite
pleasure
to
taste
this
beer
both
years
are
great
beers
and
enjoyable
i
liked
the
earthiness
of
the
fresher
bottle
and
i
feel
it
gave
it
better
balance
i
wish
i
could
combine
the
flavor
of
the
2012
with
the
lack
of
booziness
of
the
2011
great
job
by
avery
in
commiting
to
a
flavor
profile
and
nailing
it
a
nice
treat
in
small
doses
im
glad
that
i
split
the
bottle
though
as
a
little
goes
a
long
way
i
would
happily
drink
it
again
though
because
this
is
a
tasty
beastly
take
on
a
seasonal
classic
overall
i
expected
more
from
this
love
the
style
and
love
the
brewery
but
great
pumpkin
still
stands
as
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
just
watched
i
heart
huckabees
epic
movie
yet
so
humble
in
its
honest
and
easy
truth
easy
truth
about
the
complexities
of
life
any
fart
this
beer
started
out
huge
big
pumpkin
aroma
and
flavor
some
molasses
spicy
alcohol
little
hop
profile
then
it
immediately
became
a
dogfish
120
not
quite
a
mephistopheles
but
almost
a
samael
dusty
profile
huge
alcohol
taste
one
dimensional
just
heavy
booze
then
it
hit
me
the
complexities
in
this
brew
are
buried
beneath
the
dominate
alcohol
so
subtle
but
very
real
just
like
i
heart
huckabees
this
beer
is
real
life
great
at
first
redundant
inbetween
and
a
real
eye
opener
in
the
end
oh
and
it
is
crimson
in
color
just
like
the
other
rum
beer
ive
had
in
this
series
the
black
tot
i
think
its
waaayyyy
too
boozy
go
fudge
yourself
avery
fudge
away
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
take
your
time
with
this
beer
youre
not
going
anywhere
any
time
soon
when
youre
drinking
this
beer
this
is
one
of
my
more
unique
beers
that
ive
had
lately
is
it
worth
a
shot
oh
yeah
even
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
its
still
worth
a
shot
o
the
strong
alcohol
presence
forced
me
to
score
this
lower
on
the
taste
scale
which
is
unfortunate
because
the
beer
is
wonderfully
complex
the
first
few
sips
left
my
throat
with
a
fire
in
the
hole
too
medicinal
and
needs
to
be
aged
to
mellow
out
as
would
any
young
high
alcohol
beer
like
this
imo
good
thing
i
have
5
of
these
left
to
cellar
experiment
with
looking
forward
to
trying
another
in
612
months
to
see
how
its
progressing
d
very
drinkable
the
almost
16
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
overall
balance
is
fantastic
o
rumpkin
is
definitely
a
unique
beer
in
the
pumpkin
category
for
what
it
is
an
ultra
boozy
spiced
very
sweet
pumpkin
beer
it
definitely
is
well
done
in
my
opinion
but
is
not
for
everyone
i
definitely
suggest
lying
some
down
for
a
year
or
two
the
spicessweetness
will
dull
down
a
bit
and
if
anything
it
will
become
a
bit
smoother
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
although
i
wish
i
split
it
with
someone
and
at
a
15
price
tag
it
isnt
something
i
would
buy
much
of
o
huge
improvement
i
actually
wish
i
had
another
bottle
to
hold
onto
for
a
few
year
my
guess
is
this
will
only
continue
to
get
better
i
absolutely
recommend
you
age
this
over
drinking
it
fresh
having
had
it
fresh
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
this
is
much
better
4
5
o
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
but
alas
im
just
left
perplexed
sticking
a
pumpkin
ale
in
a
rum
barrel
sounds
like
an
amazing
idea
somewhere
along
the
line
avery
decided
to
make
the
beer
an
18
abv
monster
big
boozy
beers
rarely
bother
me
but
this
one
is
just
a
bit
too
harsh
and
simple
really
rich
mouthfeel
full
bodied
with
a
light
to
medium
carbonation
the
alcohol
hotness
is
really
pleasant
and
the
barrel
aged
taste
is
great
i
wish
there
were
more
of
a
rum
flavor
but
it
could
be
that
its
just
blended
into
the
mix
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
certainly
full
bodied
and
a
slight
weak
carbonation
level
for
such
a
high
alcohol
beer
its
actually
not
too
hot
im
sure
rum
has
something
to
do
with
it
instead
of
the
normal
bourbon
or
whiskey
barrel
beers
the
balance
is
good
starts
really
sweet
and
a
nice
warm
finish
its
drinkable
but
certainly
a
nice
sipper
good
night
cap
beer
on
a
cool
evening
well
done
avery
another
solid
brew
o
the
rum
aging
works
very
well
with
the
pumpkin
beer
i
think
another
year
on
this
beer
and
the
booze
will
fade
more
and
will
drink
very
well
in
all
a
very
good
winter
slow
sipper
overall
i
doubt
im
going
to
be
able
to
finish
this
i
figured
i
could
handle
the
12
oz
bottle
but
this
is
intense
not
really
worth
the
flavors
it
provides
i
scooped
up
one
these
by
chance
as
my
local
beer
store
was
not
suppose
to
get
any
of
these
glad
they
did
though
poured
into
a
snifter
stuck
my
nose
into
it
and
was
punched
in
the
face
with
rum
notes
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
pours
with
a
slight
head
and
quickly
disipates
to
a
clear
dark
redishorange
color
brew
very
smooth
and
sweet
and
the
first
sip
left
behind
a
nice
burn
in
my
chest
almost
as
if
i
took
a
shot
of
whiskey
the
most
overwhelming
notes
on
the
palate
to
me
is
the
rum
and
molasses
sweetness
this
is
a
very
refreshing
change
from
the
super
bready
big
pumpkin
beers
on
the
market
like
the
pumpking
from
southern
tier
though
no
where
near
the
abv
of
this
aside
from
this
being
a
little
to
much
on
the
sweet
side
i
wish
i
was
able
to
get
more
and
set
aside
until
next
year
because
i
would
love
to
see
how
this
would
do
with
a
year
or
two
of
aging
overall
great
beer
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
extreme
brews
plus
since
only
418
cases
of
this
were
sold
this
year
you
would
be
silly
not
to
pick
on
up
if
you
find
it
and
have
not
tried
it
yet
o
rumpkin
is
as
well
crafted
as
any
extreme
high
gravity
brew
out
there
very
difficult
to
make
18
as
palatable
as
avery
has
brewdog
should
take
some
notes
from
these
guys
job
well
done
overall
if
you
see
this
drink
it
period
overall
this
is
stunning
beer
and
most
certainly
not
your
average
pumpkin
ale
the
difference
between
this
and
the
standard
seasonal
offering
is
kind
of
like
the
difference
between
a
toyota
camry
and
a
firebreathing
gasguzzling
nitroused
funny
car
this
does
of
course
mean
that
anyone
not
already
familiar
with
some
of
the
more
extreme
possibilities
of
barrel
aging
should
likely
be
very
wary
of
this
brew
and
anyone
who
finds
the
alcohol
kick
of
straight
bourbon
or
rum
should
also
stay
away
but
if
you
are
a
fan
and
youre
ready
to
spend
several
hours
nursing
this
sucker
because
theres
no
way
youre
going
to
shoot
this
in
ten
minutes
its
definitely
an
amazing
offering
o
i
didnt
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
i
love
pumpkin
beers
but
the
booziness
is
distracting
to
me
not
sure
the
process
to
sit
this
on
rum
barrels
but
id
be
curious
to
know
if
theres
any
way
to
cut
the
abv
a
bit
to
optimize
the
flavour
profile
of
this
a
bit
more
it
has
potential
at
a
lower
abv
to
be
good
the
autumn
pumpkin
spice
notes
are
nice
and
well
executed
when
not
hidden
but
again
just
too
boozy
o
splitting
this
one
3
ways
was
about
right
the
alcohol
and
thickness
of
this
one
makes
it
difficult
to
drink
much
of
in
a
session
despite
the
booziness
and
alcohol
burn
what
do
you
expect
at
18
i
really
like
this
one
and
would
buy
it
each
year
its
almost
like
drinking
something
outside
of
the
beer
realm
if
you
like
strong
beer
rum
or
any
dessertlike
beverage
than
seek
this
one
out
despite
the
steep
price
tag
id
like
to
set
a
few
aside
next
chance
i
get
id
love
to
have
a
5
year
old
version
of
this
one
o
this
is
a
really
good
brew
rum
barrel
aging
seems
to
really
round
out
the
spice
of
this
abv
monster
giving
it
a
nice
pumpkin
pie
like
spicing
without
being
overbearing
i
really
enjoyed
this
honestly
i
went
in
with
a
negative
attitude
not
being
a
fan
of
the
style
the
idea
sounded
gross
to
me
and
i
now
have
a
favorite
pumkin
beer
glad
i
have
this
a
try
the
taste
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
aroma
probably
because
the
alcohol
is
overwhelming
the
subtler
elements
have
another
bottle
for
the
cellar
so
well
see
how
this
drinks
in
a
year
or
two
an
interesting
beer
and
just
about
as
big
as
it
gets
worth
a
try
but
probably
only
once
odis
this
my
favorite
pump
without
question
the
answer
is
yessir
transcends
the
boundary
i
thought
a
pumpkin
brew
could
reach
this
is
not
just
a
great
pumpkin
ale
this
is
a
great
time
so
happy
to
have
had
this
rum
and
pumpkin
rum
and
pumpkin
rum
and
pumpkin
pours
a
burnt
dark
orangebronze
with
absolutely
zero
head
aroma
has
a
ton
of
heat
to
it
dominated
by
the
rum
with
some
pumpkin
and
spices
hiding
underneath
flavor
too
is
dominated
by
the
heat
it
lets
you
know
its
18
but
the
other
flavors
are
more
prevalent
in
the
flavor
some
pumpkin
spices
and
a
nice
thick
sugary
vanilla
mouthfeel
is
nice
fuller
with
little
activity
overall
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
this
than
it
delivered
avery
usually
does
an
amazing
job
disguising
the
abv
in
these
beers
but
here
all
18
definitely
showed
itself
i
would
have
liked
the
pumpkin
and
spices
to
have
been
more
assertive
to
help
balance
things
out
wow
thanks
to
my
friend
chris
for
shipping
this
one
in
for
me
from
colorado
the
pumpkin
beer
of
pumpkin
beers
18
1
alcohol
is
out
of
control
but
you
would
not
know
the
alky
content
is
that
high
beer
is
smooth
and
sweet
pours
a
nice
dark
orange
amber
color
cloudy
not
clear
smell
and
taste
is
of
sweet
rum
caramel
sweet
sweet
caramel
and
spices
mouthfeel
is
super
smooth
almost
of
an
oily
consistency
but
nice
bringing
the
flavors
together
overall
i
think
this
si
the
best
pumpkinfall
seasonal
beer
that
i
have
enjoyed
this
2012
season
very
nice
this
has
been
way
way
up
on
my
list
for
a
long
time
and
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
this
today
its
from
2012
bottled
on
september
17th
it
pours
a
seasonally
perfect
orange
caramel
color
it
doesnt
appear
to
have
much
carbonation
to
it
as
there
is
basically
no
head
after
the
big
tan
bubbles
fade
out
it
smells
sweet
like
molasses
and
quite
boozy
as
it
of
course
must
at
this
strength
i
smell
some
vanilla
and
sweet
wood
too
the
rum
conditioning
is
obvious
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
beautiful
everything
i
hoped
it
would
be
mellow
and
squashy
at
first
lots
of
pumpkin
flavor
and
not
too
much
spice
at
all
it
says
ginger
on
the
bottle
and
i
can
taste
a
hint
of
that
in
there
which
is
a
nice
twist
in
a
pumpkin
beer
all
of
a
sudden
though
the
alcohol
sets
in
and
is
overpowering
but
it
doesnt
last
that
long
before
a
swet
nugmeg
vanilla
fall
spice
thing
comes
in
and
drags
you
through
a
long
strong
finish
that
has
hints
of
apple
and
whiskey
so
delicious
its
incredible
really
the
rum
component
is
perfect
in
a
pumpkin
beer
where
sometimes
i
think
its
weird
in
other
beers
because
of
its
sweetness
this
works
wonderfully
i
also
really
dig
the
mouthfeel
despite
its
really
low
carbonation
the
alcohol
almost
acts
as
a
surrogate
for
the
bubbles
keeping
it
quite
light
with
lots
of
sting
in
the
mouth
its
vigorous
in
that
way
the
sugar
content
is
high
but
its
okay
this
is
the
perfect
fall
beer
definitely
on
to
share
and
definitely
worth
the
price
whatever
the
hell
i
paid
for
this
m
its
a
big
medium
leading
to
full
pumpkin
beers
arent
usually
my
thing
but
this
was
an
enjoyable
over
the
top
take
on
one
would
still
prefer
some
other
barrel
aged
things
to
this
but
still
very
solid
overall
this
beer
was
amazing
ive
had
it
fresh
and
aging
it
for
almost
a
year
has
transformed
it
into
a
completely
different
class
this
beer
is
definitely
the
gold
standard
when
it
comes
to
pumpkinspiced
beers
yet
its
uniquely
different
from
any
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
its
a
shame
that
there
is
no
more
of
this
beer
available
and
no
plans
have
been
made
to
release
it
again
one
thing
is
for
certain
though
if
it
does
get
released
again
i
will
be
hoarding
a
case
for
my
collection
o
very
surprised
this
is
boozy
and
really
too
much
for
one
person
to
comfortably
enjoy
but
its
like
a
pumpkin
barleywine
a
behemoth
of
a
pumpkin
beer
that
is
very
well
made
like
a
traditional
pumpkin
on
steroids
avery
rumpkin
overcomes
its
shortcomings
to
in
the
end
become
a
pretty
good
beer
bonus
points
for
using
come
three
times
in
the
last
sentence
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
no
real
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
in
it
as
well
as
some
rum
notes
i
get
some
cinnamon
and
allspice
most
predominantly
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
some
big
pumpkin
notes
as
well
as
some
cinnamon
allspice
and
cloves
there
is
also
a
good
dose
of
oak
and
a
ton
of
rum
character
the
beer
is
very
boozy
and
fairly
sweet
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
beer
hides
the
abv
well
and
drinks
fairly
easy
despite
all
the
spices
reminds
me
of
new
hollands
rum
ichabod
originally
reviewed
12202011
rumpkin
will
age
with
the
best
of
them
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
develops
in
a
few
years
o
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
should
be
expected
that
this
would
be
super
boozy
glad
i
have
a
few
extra
bottles
to
try
and
age
to
see
if
things
mellow
out
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
despite
being
a
huge
brew
it
is
lively
in
the
feel
with
the
bubbles
keeping
this
one
from
really
dragging
you
down
and
destroying
your
palate
too
easily
the
big
presence
of
alcohol
also
helps
to
seemingly
thin
things
out
a
bit
by
almost
evaporating
on
the
tongue
overall
i
found
this
brew
to
be
really
good
i
know
it
is
met
with
big
variance
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
will
be
looking
to
secure
more
of
this
for
drinking
in
october
for
years
to
come
o
soo
this
is
a
good
offering
nice
and
complex
but
prolly
should
of
split
it
with
a
friend
to
compare
notes
with
i
dig
it
but
wish
it
was
a
little
drier
and
wish
it
i
could
taste
more
of
the
wood
and
rum
o
the
tap
version
of
this
was
soso
but
this
bottle
is
great
stuff
i
am
sad
i
only
have
one
more
of
these
and
definitely
plan
to
get
more
during
the
next
release
o
overall
a
winner
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
having
this
once
before
and
it
is
just
as
amazing
as
i
remembered
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
this
one
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
as
far
as
barrel
aged
beers
go
this
one
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
perpetual
iso
o
i
planned
on
rumpkin
being
my
last
beer
of
the
night
but
that
wouldnt
have
been
fair
to
myself
or
my
palate
so
i
sent
back
what
remained
in
the
glass
and
ordered
something
that
i
could
enjoy
rich
the
richest
pumpkin
i
have
had
i
am
overwhelmed
by
booze
and
rum
did
i
know
and
expect
16
abv
medium
brown
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
smooth
mouthfeel
a
tad
above
average
no
lasting
head
spicy
invigorating
but
yes
high
abv
aroma
damn
i
must
eat
to
stay
balanced
after
this
amount
of
booze
but
damn
worth
it
o
a
wee
hot
after
its
gone
down
and
sat
a
while
but
this
is
very
enjoyable
definitely
one
to
split
sip
and
savor
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
i
can
see
how
it
could
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
some
but
its
a
gustatory
homerun
for
me
the
second
bottle
was
a
bit
overkill
but
the
first
one
was
amazing
o
the
sweetness
of
this
one
mixed
with
the
high
abv
made
it
a
little
tough
to
get
through
definitely
a
sipper
if
ive
ever
encountered
one
really
interesting
idea
although
i
wonder
if
rum
barrels
were
the
best
choice
for
a
beer
like
this
o
well
its
a
nice
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
but
a
bit
too
boozy
for
me
to
enjoy
more
then
46oz
i
couldnt
finish
the
12oz
bottle
by
myself
without
fear
of
passing
out
so
i
just
gave
the
rest
to
my
sink
that
said
i
would
easily
drink
my
first
pour
and
did
enjoy
it
its
different
but
not
near
excellent
or
worldclass
give
it
a
try
and
see
for
yourself
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
dark
orangey
color
ale
with
a
sizeable
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
rums
and
cinnamon
is
quite
intense
with
loads
of
sweet
notes
taste
is
a
complex
mix
of
cinnamon
light
pumpkin
and
rums
layered
with
a
solid
but
extremely
sweet
malt
backbone
body
is
full
with
limited
filtration
and
good
carbonation
this
is
a
complex
one
for
sure
though
it
was
too
sweet
a
12
ounces
bottle
can
easily
be
shared
to
drink
repeatedly
the
bottle
has
an
interesting
label
and
describes
the
beer
adequately
its
easy
to
observe
a
thin
layer
of
yeast
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
an
unexpectedly
rich
hazelnut
brown
pours
from
the
bottle
leaving
almost
no
head
it
smells
like
a
caramel
apple
mixed
with
fall
spices
intoxicating
there
is
something
slightly
vegetal
smelling
and
almost
none
of
the
alcohol
bite
can
be
detected
in
the
nose
the
taste
follows
through
with
syrupy
brown
sugar
and
intense
rum
which
is
followed
by
an
interesting
contrast
from
the
potent
alcohol
this
beer
defines
fall
4
5
d
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
think
pumpkin
beers
are
a
great
thing
but
sooo
many
breweries
bitch
out
and
make
weak
tasteless
base
beers
and
throw
pumpkin
spices
in
avery
gets
all
the
credit
in
the
world
for
bucking
that
trend
pours
a
deep
copperbrown
color
with
good
clarity
a
small
tan
head
fades
and
leaves
some
lacing
smell
is
full
of
alcohol
with
lots
of
spices
pumpkins
grains
and
caramel
aroma
is
strong
taste
is
decent
so
much
booze
and
pumpkin
not
much
going
on
in
the
taste
leaves
a
sticky
coating
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
overall
this
is
a
truly
unique
beer
but
just
too
much
for
my
palate
do
drinkability
is
surprisingly
high
my
prior
experience
with
averys
high
alcohol
beers
mephistopheles
ended
in
a
very
alcoholic
affair
that
was
a
challenge
to
get
this
rumpkin
is
almost
completely
different
from
that
however
as
even
though
it
is
still
a
beer
that
is
gently
nursed
and
sipped
each
taste
is
to
be
savored
as
even
the
smallest
sip
delivers
a
rush
of
flavor
i
guess
my
only
qualm
is
that
i
wouldnt
exactly
call
this
a
pumpkin
beer
as
it
isnt
the
focal
point
of
this
beer
at
all
the
alcohol
is
not
as
offputting
as
i
was
preparing
for
but
i
can
easily
feel
it
halfway
through
the
glass
thankfully
this
is
only
bottled
in
a
12oz
format
88100
o
for
a
guy
that
hates
pumpkin
beers
this
is
mildly
enjoyable
about
halfway
through
the
beer
i
discovered
i
was
drinking
a
15
9
beer
other
than
a
very
slight
heat
im
getting
in
my
gums
the
booze
is
hidden
like
a
boss
this
beer
is
very
original
and
a
treat
for
anyone
who
doesnt
mind
the
intense
flavor
and
noticeable
alcohol
overall
definitely
a
sipper
but
a
nice
treatment
for
the
pumpkin
ale
the
rum
flavors
add
a
nice
depth
that
compliments
the
delicious
fall
spices
a
bit
too
aggressive
overall
but
a
year
or
two
should
make
this
interesting
bottle
poured
into
founders
cbs
snifter
pours
a
dull
brown
with
no
head
whatsoever
smell
is
wet
wood
with
some
hint
of
orangered
fruit
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
but
no
overly
so
taste
is
first
tangy
that
gave
me
a
twinge
in
my
jaw
usually
means
sourbitter
then
a
burst
of
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
then
the
finish
has
as
darkness
to
it
that
is
musty
that
turns
too
sweet
after
about
35
seconds
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
sure
if
i
will
be
buying
it
again
one
thing
of
note
is
that
there
is
absolutely
no
alcohol
hint
at
all
which
is
really
weird
all
this
being
said
i
am
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
so
the
review
might
be
slanted
as
such
overall
well
i
am
not
going
to
lie
this
beer
impressed
me
if
nothing
else
due
to
the
fact
it
is
almost
16
and
the
alcohol
is
insanely
well
hidden
there
is
some
warming
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
for
how
young
this
beer
is
it
is
nothing
unacceptable
would
i
buy
another
probably
not
but
i
will
give
props
to
avery
for
this
interesting
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
o
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
it
had
old
ale
and
barleywine
qualities
to
it
the
pumpkin
gets
lost
in
the
taste
really
and
i
would
have
like
more
of
the
nose
to
shine
through
in
taste
if
it
had
a
touch
more
pumpkin
i
would
have
given
this
a
much
higher
score
not
bad
very
different
o
this
beer
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
its
seems
like
a
barleywine
or
an
old
ale
that
is
just
starting
to
turn
into
a
sour
mess
i
really
dig
the
way
the
pumpkin
and
rum
play
off
each
other
but
im
glad
i
was
only
drinking
a
6oz
pour
of
this
its
very
boozy
and
thick
proceed
with
caution
beer
is
a
little
like
syrup
very
strong
very
sweet
some
pumpkin
sneaks
through
but
the
rum
wins
on
this
one
as
i
suspected
if
you
like
rum
youd
like
this
beer
if
you
dont
like
rum
avoid
this
beer
i
for
one
liked
this
beer
but
it
gets
a
little
cloying
after
a
while
probably
couldnt
drink
a
whole
bottle
alone
but
definitely
worth
the
look
o
a
kick
to
the
mouth
a
big
bold
beer
super
spiced
and
sweet
this
should
be
consumed
with
warning
and
moderation
never
thought
this
one
would
be
found
on
my
local
shelves
but
hey
im
not
gonna
argue
it
pours
a
sunset
tawn
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
creamtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
spiced
rum
extra
brown
sugar
light
oak
vanilla
bean
and
caramel
a
heavy
spike
of
booze
keeps
full
enjoyment
at
bay
the
taste
follows
pretty
closely
with
the
rum
getting
all
upcloseandpersonal
with
my
tastebuds
the
spices
and
vanilla
bean
are
strong
as
well
theres
pretty
much
no
trace
of
any
pumpkin
save
the
residual
spices
that
get
lost
in
the
preexisting
spice
forest
in
the
rum
and
once
again
the
booze
is
more
than
present
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thick
syrupy
feel
overall
this
was
too
much
of
a
rum
bomb
to
be
fully
enjoyable
if
you
like
spiced
rum
youll
love
this
stuff
its
not
bad
enough
to
be
considered
bad
but
nothing
i
would
really
feel
comfortable
calling
truly
good
the
beer
is
sunburst
orange
with
a
thin
off
white
cap
the
aroma
yields
booze
malt
spices
good
flavor
with
rum
emerging
more
so
than
in
the
aroma
sweet
and
best
in
small
doses
alcohol
is
there
but
not
a
barrier
to
enjoyment
even
in
spite
of
the
nearly
16
abv
overall
very
good
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
d
this
was
really
a
great
beer
amazingly
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
scent
and
taste
were
really
enjoyable
and
the
body
was
solid
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
but
not
bad
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
i
was
surprised
it
wasnt
more
complex
but
the
flavors
all
blended
really
well
together
this
was
like
a
holiday
version
of
the
beast
or
samaels
but
better
than
either
of
those
a
great
sipping
beer
for
autumnwinter
that
could
also
cellar
a
long
time
one
of
my
preferred
pumpkin
beers
overall
this
is
is
sweet
beastly
rich
and
powerful
great
flavors
and
enjoyable
complexity
it
looked
fine
but
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
someone
poured
a
glass
of
rum
and
a
punch
of
rotten
fermented
pumpkin
in
my
ale
i
could
not
stand
anymore
than
three
sips
it
was
horrid
and
i
had
a
terrible
stomach
ache
all
night
i
am
very
disappointed
with
avery
i
know
that
they
didnt
intend
for
this
to
happen
and
it
was
a
mishap
but
if
a
beer
is
that
expensive
i
expect
it
to
be
done
properly
i
dont
want
this
to
be
taken
as
a
bashing
of
avery
i
just
wanted
to
log
my
experience
of
this
beer
and
hopefully
make
people
aware
that
there
may
have
been
a
bad
barrel
or
two
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
it
is
too
boozy
and
too
sweet
these
aspects
take
over
any
subtle
other
flavors
that
might
appear
maybe
with
age
this
will
settle
some
but
its
hard
to
imagine
it
getting
much
better
with
the
sweetness
as
high
as
it
is
i
get
the
appeal
but
a
rare
miss
from
avery
for
me
o
a
very
nice
and
sweet
pumpkin
ale
overall
just
way
too
sweet
and
boozy
for
my
taste
although
i
can
see
where
it
might
be
appealing
to
others
disappointing
especially
considering
its
12
95
price
point
o
interesting
and
unique
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
i
wish
the
pumpkin
itself
were
stronger
i
think
that
would
really
round
this
one
out
and
make
it
amazing
i
applaud
avery
for
their
inventive
brews
i
happen
to
be
fairly
particular
about
my
pumpkin
ales
and
i
was
very
curious
when
i
came
across
this
one
in
the
local
grocery
store
for
a
winter
seasonal
first
off
very
little
head
and
carbonation
which
really
leaves
the
mouthfeel
to
the
weight
of
the
brew
itself
soft
and
a
little
flat
a
little
heavy
and
naturally
so
at
15
it
is
a
very
interesting
combination
i
just
felt
like
the
abv
weighed
it
down
aging
in
old
rum
barrels
was
a
clever
combo
i
wonder
if
this
might
be
better
with
a
bourbon
barrel
nevertheless
the
pumpkin
was
drowned
out
i
got
a
little
bit
but
i
most
tasted
some
spice
and
brewing
sugar
not
a
bad
beer
imaginative
pumpkin
ale
probably
best
for
when
you
are
in
an
exploratory
mood
notes
monster
brew
that
i
wonder
if
it
will
age
graciously
for
now
worth
the
try
but
ultimately
a
bit
much
lets
see
how
the
other
bottle
ages
dangerously
drinkable
beer
good
thing
for
5
5
oz
pours
rum
and
pumpkin
i
did
not
know
that
they
could
be
friends
this
beer
is
as
surprising
as
it
is
good
boozy
heavy
sugary
it
should
be
a
mess
but
its
actually
tasty
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
it
is
still
a
pumpkin
beer
so
that
is
not
saying
much
d
pretty
happy
with
this
one
except
for
the
price
o
this
is
a
really
unqiue
and
tasty
beer
glad
i
was
able
to
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
12
inch
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
dots
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
spices
pumpkin
rum
and
wood
a
very
nice
barrel
aged
aroma
on
this
one
taste
is
of
malt
sugar
and
spice
cinnamon
and
the
like
graham
crackers
rum
and
wood
the
pumpkin
is
there
but
very
subtle
in
my
opinion
this
beer
has
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
with
crisp
and
sticky
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
that
turned
out
extremely
well
with
the
rum
barrel
aging
for
some
reason
it
just
doesnt
all
come
together
right
a
touch
too
sweet
for
sure
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
i
have
ever
had
this
is
well
put
together
and
the
flavors
are
very
complex
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
is
after
it
ages
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
below
average
overall
i
didnt
really
care
for
it
it
was
cloyingly
sweet
with
too
much
boozy
rum
showing
through
the
pumpkin
beer
flavors
just
seemed
completely
hidden
and
overshadowed
to
me
not
an
enjoyable
beer
for
me
at
all
hands
down
my
fave
pumpkin
ale
big
strong
powerful
had
it
at
the
great
pumpkin
alefest
at
elysian
brewery
spice
pumpkin
and
rum
all
in
great
balance
throughout
i
dare
say
this
is
a
pumpkin
ale
for
barley
wine
fanswich
i
am
wish
i
could
have
got
my
hands
on
some
bottles
for
my
cellar
overall
this
is
well
done
but
its
not
my
style
and
is
a
bit
much
for
me
four
ounces
is
more
than
enough
very
chewy
and
creamy
low
carbonation
good
sipper
with
a
very
complex
flavor
profile
im
not
sure
id
like
another
but
it
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
to
be
sipped
and
appreciated
overall
not
a
big
pumpkin
beer
fan
and
i
hate
rum
but
as
i
said
this
one
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
highly
creative
and
delicious
these
brewers
knew
what
they
were
doing
oh
and
15
90
abv
where
d
boozy
but
in
the
right
ways
the
only
barrel
aged
pumpkin
ale
i
have
tried
so
far
and
i
would
say
rum
was
a
solid
choice
as
it
played
nicely
with
spicing
recommended
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
surprisingly
light
in
color
a
light
murky
brown
with
a
very
thin
head
smells
of
pumpkin
and
spices
cake
and
pumpkin
tastes
are
upfront
with
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
lingering
on
the
pallet
along
with
a
boozy
warming
sensation
15
9
anyone
the
beer
is
a
sipper
for
sure
feels
real
bubbly
in
the
mouth
my
first
rumpkin
been
looking
forward
to
this
big
bastard
for
awhile
poured
from
bottle
into
brooklyn
snifter
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
color
reminiscent
of
dirty
drain
water
except
darker
no
head
whatsoever
but
i
expected
that
given
the
abv
smell
booze
rum
dark
fruits
like
currants
trifle
cake
brown
sugar
the
rum
is
unmistakable
and
overwhelming
taste
wow
a
sweet
blast
of
rum
soaked
cake
to
the
front
of
the
tongue
brown
sugar
candied
dark
fruit
carries
forward
second
some
nice
bitterness
evens
out
the
sweet
flavors
on
the
back
of
the
throat
this
is
boozy
as
hell
but
it
all
works
well
together
what
it
does
not
remind
me
of
at
all
is
pumpkin
i
really
get
more
heavy
rum
dark
fruit
spices
and
sweet
candied
sugar
very
enjoyable
i
will
be
aging
a
bottle
of
this
too
but
i
really
like
this
fresh
a
very
drinkable
15
6
beer
o
this
is
a
fantastic
treat
would
love
to
try
it
with
some
age
on
it
to
see
how
the
flavors
continue
to
meld
and
hopefully
the
booze
will
mellow
a
little
looks
like
i
gotta
fork
out
the
dough
for
another
bottle
o
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
good
and
it
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
the
taste
was
a
bit
sweet
and
boozy
but
i
enjoyed
the
nose
quite
a
bit
would
be
interested
to
see
how
this
is
with
a
year
on
it
may
throw
a
bottle
in
the
cellar
until
next
thanksgiving
drink
very
boozy
and
strong
but
well
tamed
if
youve
had
this
beer
that
sentence
makes
sense
the
pumpkinrum
combo
was
a
smart
choice
for
avery
to
go
with
one
of
the
other
barrel
treatments
and
i
fear
this
beer
wouldnt
have
worked
as
well
i
feel
a
year
for
this
to
sit
and
mellow
would
do
wonders
for
it
now
i
guess
i
have
to
try
and
find
another
bottle
since
bevmo
sold
out
what
a
problem
to
have
overall
a
very
unique
complex
brew
o
yeah
its
really
good
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
it
is
full
of
booze
really
great
smell
and
flavor
but
id
be
suprised
if
someone
could
finish
one
of
these
by
themselves
great
for
sharing
though
especially
around
the
holidays
i
can
see
where
theyre
trying
to
go
but
to
me
they
didnt
quite
arrive
poured
with
a
small
cream
colored
head
that
quickly
subsided
and
no
lace
color
is
a
cloudy
honey
amber
aroma
is
malt
pumpkin
spice
dark
ripe
fruit
raisins
flavors
like
nose
with
sweet
malt
pumpkin
and
rum
flavors
on
top
followed
by
the
carbonic
tang
then
the
other
thangs
body
is
excellen
but
carbonation
seems
a
bit
light
finish
is
like
flavor
very
long
and
surprisingly
not
up
front
boozy
its
there
you
know
its
there
and
then
oh
man
is
it
there
verdict
this
is
a
strong
sipping
beer
so
im
actually
glad
it
comes
in
a
12
oz
bottle
the
flavors
are
really
balanced
and
the
rum
barrels
really
make
this
beer
easily
my
new
favorite
pumpkin
beer
i
dont
know
that
pumpkin
beers
are
very
good
for
aging
but
i
have
a
hunch
that
this
one
is
going
to
get
better
over
26
years
oi
do
not
know
why
but
i
kept
sipping
on
this
beer
it
is
not
that
great
but
for
some
reasonable
enjoyable
worth
a
try
once
it
is
like
old
school
barleywine
with
a
pumpkin
twist
super
weird
beer
fuller
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
chewy
and
coating
on
the
tongue
i
was
happy
to
try
this
but
i
thought
the
rum
was
a
little
overboard
and
the
sweetness
was
pretty
strong
o
i
was
told
by
some
other
patrons
to
leave
this
palatewrecker
toward
the
end
i
was
skeptical
how
badly
could
this
wreck
a
palate
at
a
barrel
aged
beer
fest
turns
out
quite
badly
a
very
sweet
beer
t
the
pumpkin
works
unbelievably
well
with
the
sweetness
of
the
rum
some
nice
spice
notes
coupled
with
the
alcohol
make
you
feel
like
youre
eating
a
warm
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
definitely
a
sipper
but
delicious
tremendous
beer
very
enjoyable
the
flavors
mesh
very
well
outstanding
balance
on
the
palate
rumpkin
is
a
bit
of
a
sipper
though
it
is
certainly
a
beer
that
you
do
not
mind
nursing
for
an
evening
big
thanks
to
fosterjm
for
this
excellent
extra
very
appreciative
for
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
the
bottle
says
this
is
from
batch
no
1
pours
a
deep
orangecopper
color
pretty
clear
and
tons
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
to
generate
a
fizzy
two
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipated
aroma
is
intense
brown
sugar
vanilla
and
spice
hit
first
but
there
is
a
nice
overall
pumpkin
presence
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
alcohol
is
definitely
noticeable
on
the
nose
but
not
offensive
the
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
insane
amounts
of
carbonation
on
my
tongue
starts
out
syrupy
sweet
but
the
spices
come
in
to
help
balance
it
out
it
finishes
with
a
semidry
fresh
pumpkin
taste
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thick
but
the
carbonation
is
very
high
overall
the
most
unique
and
intense
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
to
date
if
there
were
such
thing
as
a
doubleimperial
pumpkin
ale
this
would
fit
the
bill
there
are
definitely
some
flaws
to
the
beer
the
carbonation
is
just
too
much
there
is
also
a
definite
burn
from
the
alcohol
i
know
15
9
abv
is
high
but
avery
could
have
masked
the
alcohol
taste
more
with
that
said
this
is
an
epic
beer
and
one
that
i
would
definitely
try
again
the
rum
barrels
add
a
very
nice
touch
this
will
definitely
benefit
from
aging
o
a
decent
beer
but
much
too
sweet
i
like
the
rum
characters
but
the
pumpkin
aspects
are
lost
in
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
overall
i
dig
this
beer
one
of
the
best
rum
barrel
beers
ive
had
would
i
buy
another
for
10
probably
not
but
it
is
good
taste
mouthfeel
incredibly
sweet
almost
cloying
a
ton
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
along
with
a
big
pumpkin
and
spice
character
full
syrupy
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
mellow
rum
character
very
mild
oak
presence
warming
going
down
but
thankfully
not
harshly
boozy
sweet
sugary
finish
lingering
spices
o
damn
good
beer
o
an
interesting
beer
at
almost
16
abv
the
ethanol
is
a
player
and
the
high
final
gravity
defines
the
beer
fun
beer
to
drink
does
remind
me
of
olde
school
barleywine
a
bit
but
with
pumpkins
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
very
thin
lacing
you
get
a
lot
of
booze
smelling
it
but
also
a
clearly
distinct
pumpkin
aroma
thats
not
always
the
case
for
a
pumpkin
ale
a
real
rummy
sweetness
around
the
edges
its
a
big
beer
no
doubt
about
it
but
also
very
sweet
and
shippable
the
effervescence
helps
keep
it
from
feeling
heavy
on
the
palate
in
a
word
wow
2012
version
a
lot
more
pumpkin
in
this
than
i
remember
from
2011
i
think
i
like
it
better
pretty
good
but
probably
not
one
ill
seek
out
like
i
would
meph
addict
or
some
other
avery
brews
overall
this
beer
is
right
up
my
alley
im
a
huge
fan
of
breweries
trying
different
and
weird
things
i
would
have
another
this
beer
pours

copper
color
with
some
ruby
hues
there
was
a
tiny
layer
of
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
leaving
some
specs
of
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
big
and
sweet
there
are
dark
toasted
malt
dark
fruits
spiced
rum
pumpkin
and
holiday
spices
there
is
a
big
booziness
as
well
the
taste
is
deep
dark
and
sweet
there
are
fruit
flavors
like
raisin
fig
cherry
and
plum
there
is
a
hefty
dose
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
it
is
quite
boozy
which
is
to
be
expected
from
a
beer
that
is
almost
14
alcohol
the
whole
flavor
seems
to
linger
on
the
palate
in
the
finish
this
is
full
bodied
and
has
more
carbonation
than
i
thought
it
would
have
there
is
some
tingling
and
some
roastiness
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
pretty
big
boozy
warmth
in
the
finish
this
has
really
good
drinkability
it
is
most
definitely
a
slow
sipper
but
the
flavor
is
great
i
enjoyed
every
drop
of
this
one
i
really
think
the
rum
barrels
were
a
good
choice
for
this
beer
i
recommend
trying
this
i
thought
it
was
great
o
what
a
truly
unique
beer
not
the
easiest
drinker
but
there
is
so
much
more
here
that
becomes
a
side
note
i
liked
not
loved
this
brew
but
do
recommend
any
ba
try
it
simply
because
it
is
so
original
not
sure
i
can
improve
upon
my
prior
an
unrefined
sugar
pumpkin
spiced
rum
bomb
reflection
4
overall
honestly
pumpkin
beers
dont
get
better
than
this
if
you
get
the
chance
drink
it
nearly
no
head
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
orangebrown
color
with
a
great
alcohol
scent
pumpkin
taste
is
evident
but
not
so
much
as
the
rum
flavor
not
a
huge
fan
of
rum
to
begin
with
but
overall
great
job
by
avery
really
different
but
absolutely
delicious
overall
never
had
a
pumpkin
beer
that
compares
the
closest
would
have
to
be
st
arnolds
imp
stout
with
pumpkin
spices
which
is
a
pumpkin
stout
but
anyways
this
is
great
fresh
but
down
the
road
o
tastes
like
a
shot
of
captain
morgans
with
a
slight
beer
kick
not
the
most
impressive
but
still
a
nice
brew
this
doesnt
fit
the
style
but
its
enjoyable
i
will
recommend
this
one
but
i
wont
be
buying
any
more
many
thanks
to
my
friend
ken
for
sharing
a
bottle
of
this
one
late
sunday
morning
a
perfect
time
for
this
type
of
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
orange
amber
with
a
small
lingering
amber
head
on
the
nose
i
got
rum
pumpkin
pie
cinnamon
and
cloves
on
the
palate
mediumbodied
very
sweet
with
lots
of
rum
dark
brown
sugar
and
molasses
not
a
whole
lot
of
pumpkin
or
pumpkin
pie
flavor
going
on
which
is
good
the
rum
barrels
balance
nicely
against
the
pumpkin
pie
spicing
and
although
they
stand
out
they
do
so
in
a
good
way
the
rum
barrels
work
much
better
here
than
they
did
with
black
tot
pours
an
amberorange
color
very
little
carbonation
or
lacing
on
the
glass
somewhat
transparent
in
appearance
a
very
small
cocoa
head
that
actually
sticks
around
for
awhile
great
looking
beer
wow
this
is
amazing
the
nose
is
cinnamon
a
tiny
bit
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
rum
oak
and
molasses
really
complex
and
fantastic
smells
coming
from
this
beer
the
taste
really
brings
the
spices
out
though
not
overwhelmingly
so
rum
definitely
makes
its
presence
known
too
the
taste
is
almost
port
like
very
complex
flavors
and
the
15
9
abv
is
fairly
well
hidden
too
feel
is
smooth
silky
and
rich
with
a
little
alcohol
burn
on
the
end
fantastic
overall
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
by
a
landslide
although
you
dont
get
a
lot
of
pumpkin
its
great
though
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
brew
highly
recommended
on
tap
at
churchkey
in
dc
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
pours
dark
reddish
brown
with
thin
head
and
lacing
that
lasts
throughout
aromas
full
of
toffee
caramel
cinnamon
clove
slight
ginger
big
notes
of
brown
sugar
molasses
some
nice
spiced
rum
nice
sweet
pumpkin
notes
on
there
as
well
really
big
and
full
taste
is
just
as
good
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
much
completely
hidden
starts
with
notes
of
sweet
vanilla
brown
sugar
toffee
and
molasses
some
nice
cinnamon
clove
ginger
leading
into
a
perfect
blend
of
sweet
pumpkin
rum
and
a
slight
hint
of
warmth
balanced
with
a
cinnamon
clove
and
ginger
spice
combo
going
into
a
nice
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
carbed
well
enough
to
carry
the
taste
through
the
palate
nice
full
on
the
palate
as
well
to
have
a
nice
lasting
finish
what
an
interesting
ruminfused
pumpkin
ale
the
rumpkin
is
an
intense
experience
ive
only
had
it
at
the
tap
room
however
its
taste
is
hard
to
forget
it
has
anythingbutsubtle
pumpkin
and
rum
flavors
as
well
as
a
strong
alcoholic
smell
its
a
very
attractive
dark
orange
with
a
thin
head
orange
tinted
amber
with
a
little
bit
of
a
haze
to
it
and
ample
carbonation
a
nice
three
finger
head
of
white
lace
appeared
on
top
and
gradually
faded
down
into
just
a
film
across
the
top
the
aroma
was
very
big
full
of
spices
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
were
readily
noticeable
the
taste
followed
along
the
same
line
a
very
spicy
little
ale
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hotness
to
it
the
cinnamon
was
particularly
strong
and
had
a
great
effect
on
the
flavor
very
nice
light
body
and
ample
carbonation
made
it
go
down
very
easily
the
farmhouse
had
this
brew
on
tap
last
fall
and
after
seeing
it
on
their
website
i
had
to
go
try
it
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
copperish
orange
color
the
head
didnt
last
very
long
and
didnt
leave
a
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
spicy
and
boozy
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
semisweet
at
first
then
the
spices
kick
in
and
the
alcohol
warmth
finishes
off
the
taste
the
flavor
is
very
strong
and
i
really
liked
the
rum
barrel
aging
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
but
its
got
a
good
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
to
sip
on
a
cooler
autumn
night
enjoyable
enjoyed
this
on
tap
tonight
as
part
of
a
colorado
beer
week
special
tapping
at
falling
rock
reviewed
from
notes
and
a
15
minute
old
memory
the
beer
is
a
rich
copper
color
with
small
bubbles
but
no
head
to
speak
of
aromas
of
spice
specifically
cinnamon
and
clove
rich
midpalate
vanilla
with
a
butterscotch
finish
and
a
sharp
but
pleasant
alcohol
bite
this
is
a
sipper
and
an
excellent
one
if
they
ever
decide
to
bottle
this
and
i
hope
they
do
itd
be
my
go
to
snow
day
beer
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
creamy
head
smells
and
tastes
of
pumpkin
rum
and
brown
sugar
with
a
good
amount
of
spices
the
rum
really
enhances
the
pumpkin
this
tastes
like
the
best
pumpkin
pie
or
casserole
youve
ever
had
very
sweet
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
as
a
pumpkin
beer
fan
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
avery
needs
to
bottle
this
rumpkin
comes
in
the
tulip
looking
hazyish
orange
that
is
semi
bright
up
to
light
a
small
cap
of
off
white
foam
graces
the
top
of
this
one
no
stick
smell
is
str8
rum
barrel
mixed
in
with
pumpkin
spices
some
small
amounts
of
chocolate
and
some
brown
sugar
some
alcohol
as
well
for
13
percent
or
so
pretty
well
tamed
taste
is
pumpkin
spice
not
so
much
pumpkin
pie
flavor
rum
is
well
stated
comes
on
strong
and
resembles
a
spirit
in
some
fashion
some
small
cocco
molasses
booze
soaked
apples
and
the
like
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
feel
comes
off
like
a
spirit
of
sorts
coating
medium
bodied
a
light
carb
a
interesting
beer
not
one
ill
be
reaching
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
small
pours
of
this
are
encouraged
would
love
to
have
this
near
the
holidays
with
family
sampled
this
at
the
bistro
west
coast
barrel
aged
beer
festival
november

2010
d
this
one
will
warm
you
up
fast
it
is
not
very
refreshing
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
this
would
be
a
substitution
for
hard
liquor
in
my
opinion
delicious
wow
this
beer
is
excellent
my
friend
thats
drinking
it
with
me
says
its
the
best
beer
hes
had
in
months
and
i
dont
want
to
disagree
i
had
a
st
arnold
dr
9
yesterday
but
we
all
know
which
beer
really
deserves
to
be
the
imperial
pumpkin
notes
a
pretty
interesting
beer
very
tasty
not
very
complex
but
all
the
flavors
and
smells
seem
natural
and
not
artificial
i
might
consider
trying
this
one
again
even
though
its
a
bit
pricey
overall
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
monster
the
spices
are
not
overdone
and
it
all
comes
together
well
i
am
pretty
sturdy
and
this
one
has
me
whipped
at
the
4oz
mark
a
good
one
timer
i
did
not
enjoy
this
to
much
alcohol
and
nothing
else
really
mixes
well
i
would
not
recommend
this
i
love
avery
but
this
is
a
big
miss
the
taste
goes
quite
a
ways
downhill
as
the
intricate
rum
characteristics
are
overlaid
with
all
too
much
booze
just
really
really
heavy
on
the
alcohol
here
there
is
some
spicing
there
as
well
the
feel
takes
it
even
lower
as
there
is
nothing
there
but
booze
pretty
heavy
body
drinkability
isnt
all
that
high
given
the
excessive
booze
its
a
shame
that
the
booze
took
this
one
over
i
wish
this
were
in
bottles
so
i
could
lay
one
down
for
a
year
to
see
what
happens
pours
clear
dark
ruby
color
not
much
head
at
pour
aroma
smells
spicey
clovey
cinnamon
faint
pumpkin
alcohol
seems
to
be
a
big
factor
in
aroma
as
well
alcohol
from
rum
is
definitely
the
biggest
factor
in
flavor
especially
when
the
beer
is
colder
still
clovey
cinnamon
spice
in
flavor
but
not
very
well
in
balance
with
rum
pumpkin
takes
a
while
to
find
becomes
slightly
more
evident
in
flavor
as
beer
warms
mouthfeel
is
relatively
thick
finish
has
an
mild
alcohol
burn
sweetness
is
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
and
lingers
on
finish
was
hoping
for
a
litte
more
pumpkn
and
for
rum
to
be
a
little
more
balanced
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
glad
i
could
say
i
got
to
try
it
though
d
taster
was
more
than
enough
great
nose
but
after
that
not
much
great
about
it
more
like
rum
and
very
sweet
i
thought
too
syrupy
and
not
a
huge
fan
of
rum
had
to
try
it
though
rum
barrels
from
bermuda
with
real
pumpkin
in
mash
its
booze
and
more
booze
it
nearly
burns
going
down
what
the
hell
do
you
expect
from
avery
overall
at
10
for
a
10oz
serving
i
will
pass
from
now
on
however
i
cant
help
but
think
that
avery
is
onto
something
with
pairing
pumpkin
beers
and
rum
barrels
if
the
base
of
this
beer
was
anywhere
close
to
that
of
pumking
it
would
be
an
absolutely
phenomenal
beer
while
i
was
able
to
finish
this
beer
a
problem
ive
had
with
12oz
pours
of
avery
beers
at
cheeky
monk
before
i
would
again
suggest
that
a
12oz
pour
of
a
13
2
abv
beer
is
a
tad
much
i
believe
the
alcohol
content
listed
here
is
incorrect
listing
last
night
was
13
2
not
13
8
surprisingly
the
beers
own
sweetness
develops
its
into
layers
upon
layers
of
complexity
and
substitutes
balance
very
well
savory
and
succulent
throughout
overall
for
13
this
is
quite
drinkable
better
for
colder
daysnights
i
think
not
sure
what
the
pair
this
one
with
d
this
is
one
beer
that
is
a
little
bit
boozy
but
it
does
not
suffer
from
this
characteristic
amazing
flavor
and
the
nose
is
almost
as
good
rjt
taste
is
cinnamon
clove
toasted
malt
with
light
maple
in
the
background
the
maple
is
not
as
pronounced
as
i
would
have
thought
it
would
be
this
to
me
is
a
slightly
above
average
pumpkin
ale
i
do
have
others
that
i
prefer
in
the
style
very
flavorful
creation
unique
taste
right
from
the
start
the
squash
works
well
i
can
drink
this
beer
anytimenot
just
in
the
fall
nice
abv
adds
to
the
experience
overrallthis
beer
is
tremendous
so
working
under
the
impression
that
what
i
have
in
front
of
me
is
anything
like
what
its
meant
to
be
like
fresh
i
think
that
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
for
the
thanksgiving
and
christmas
holidays
and
then
going
forward
into
the
colder
months
i
occasionally
enjoy
a
spiced
beer
with
my
meal
followed
by
a
barleywine
after
dinner
as
i
relax
and
this
beer
combines
both
of
those
into
one
well
worth
trying
amber
to
copper
in
color
with
a
touch
of
head
smells
a
bit
like
raw
squash
with
background
allspice
taste
is
dominated
by
allspice
nutmeg
maybe
cinnamon
with
background
squash
flavor
and
a
lite
sweetness
carbonation
is
lighter
with
a
medium
body
overall
a
different
take
on
a
pumpkin
and
worth
a
try
smells
great
but
too
sweet
and
too
much
spice
had
great
body
and
nice
tan
head
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
o
definitely
try
if
you
get
the
chance
this
didnt
work
for
me
but
someone
who
likes
squash
might
dig
it
a
bit
more
i
am
not
a
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
but
this
one
blew
me
away
to
the
point
where
i
actually
sought
it
out
and
bought
it
in
the
bottle
the
label
states
it
is
made
with
butternut
squash
the
beer
is
wellbalanced
with
the
slight
sweetness
and
taste
of
maple
and
just
enough
spice
notes
and
pumpkin
squash
flavor
to
make
it
known
but
not
diminish
the
flavor
of
the
beer
pancakes
this
is
what
you
drink
with
pancakes
strong
maple
aroma
and
taste
dominates
fantastic
for
those
with
a
sweet
tooth
abv
doesnt
hit
until
it
is
too
late
overall
a
rather
nice
and
sweet
thick
and
tasty
pumpkin
pie
flavored
brew
with
a
huge
maple
syrup
presence
while
at
9
5
abv
the
alcohol
is
barely
detectable
and
makes
for
a
fantastic
sipping
dessert
brew
definitely
one
to
try
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
pretty
good
although
maybe
too
subdued
a
little
more
pumpkin
and
a
little
less
spice
and
this
would
be
stellar
awesome
beer
the
taste
is
good
with
light
spice
up
front
with
more
of
a
fruity
yeast
flavor
and
subtle
maple
type
fruity
earthiness
with
sweet
element
and
light
spice
mid
palate
the
taste
carries
a
subtle
vanillalike
earthiness
which
also
comes
off
sweet
with
mild
floral
aspect
the
maple
taste
comes
through
as
a
sweet
woody
taste
with
alcohol
adding
a
dry
quality
to
the
finish
without
tasting
hot
this
is
a
very
good
beer
nicely
flavored
with
pleasant
spice
profile
and
moderate
sweetness
that
works
well
with
moderately
high
level
of
alcohol
for
the
sake
of
complexity
yet
still
drinkable
for
the
strength
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
by
far
i
have
had
pumpking
warlock
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
punkn
imho
the
maple
mistress
is
better
then
some
of
the
best
while
all
of
the
above
will
satisfy
your
taste
for
pumpkin
the
maple
mistress
had
a
number
of
other
flavors
that
will
awaken
your
palate
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pretty
orangecopper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
like
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
unique
an
d
quite
good
maple
and
pumpkin
dominate
with
alcohol
not
far
behind
a
good
bit
of
spice
and
a
tasty
treat
of
a
beer
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
dark
hazy
copper
amber
with
a
short
lived
medium
beige
head
there
is
an
essence
of
pumpkin
and
vegetable
along
with
some
mild
notes
of
sweet
spice
and
maple
taste
is
sweet
flavors
a
spices
and
some
bit
of
malt
with
some
bitterness
palate
is
a
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
same
as
taste
a
combination
of
sweet
spices
squash
pumpkin
vegetable
and
mild
bitterness
on
the
end
a
bit
strong
on
the
alcohol
malt
and
maple
flavor
is
weak
overall
though
just
an
ok
brew
terrible
beer
maple
syrup
does
not
belong
in
a
beer
very
malty
with
just
a
hint
of
punpkin
this
beer
should
not
even
have
pumpkin
in
the
tittle
this
is
absolutely
the
worst
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
first
i
went
to
the
brewery
to
try
the
beer
and
it
was
completely
warm
and
flat
when
it
came
off
the
tap
very
disappointed
i
met
the
owner
who
told
me
the
beer
was
not
flat
and
if
i
did
not
like
the
carbonation
then
to
leave
besides
the
terrible
beer
the
owner
of
the
brewery
was
completely
rude
i
assume
he
was
the
owner
short
awkward
looking
guy
with
a
tattoo
on
his
arm
he
must
be
very
insecure
when
it
comes
to
his
beer
i
would
never
buy
this
beer
again
or
go
back
to
saucony
creek
must
say
did
not
realize
how
high
the
abv
was
on
this
until
got
on
this
website
bc
i
didnt
get
any
booze
at
all
in
the
finish
o
spices
and
maple
syrup
are
the
main
flavors
pretty
done
glad
i
pick
this
up
will
pick
up
up
again
next
year
when
it
is
fresh
o
an
interesting
take
that
plays
well
with
the
maple
and
spices
the
pie
crus
flavor
of
the
malt
was
an
inspired
touch
as
well
20
oz
pint
glass

md
pours
a
brownishcopper
color
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
the
head
retains
for
quite
some
time
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
most
pronounced
note
in
the
nose
is
pumpkin
the
flavor
profile
has
maple
and
brown
sugar
upfront
the
taste
of
the
pumpkin
is
completely
overwhelmed
by
the
maple
and
brown
sugar
the
finish
is
semidry
with
an
alcohol
bite
that
sneaks
up
as
the
beer
warms
and
becomes
unpleasant
by
the
end
of
the
glass
split
this
bottle
with
another
in
a
wine
glass
ive
been
anxious
to
try
this
beer
i
see
it
locally
a
lot
it
has
a
thick
mouth
feel
very
sweet
cloying
cordial
like
dessert
taste
delicious
sipper
on
a
cold
night
very
impressive
kind
of
a
silly
looking
bottle
although
i
have
seen
worse
pretty
darn
tasty
beer
and
given
the
massive
variety
of
pumpkin
ales
out
there
this
one
has
some
nice
unique
qualities
brew
dogs
would
have
me
say
hello
to
the
beer
as
i
bring
it
up
to
my
nose
for
a
sniff
but
that
is
for
landlubbers
ahoy
me
lovely
i
said
as
i
watched
the
dense
creamy
two
fingers
of
tawny
head
slowly
fall
into
the
surf

i
am
not
a
fan
of
filtration
so
cloudy
and
hazy
are
okay
by
me
in
most
beers
nose
had
the
usual
suspects
cinnamon
clove
and
nutmeg
but
not
in
overwhelming
quantities
we
may
get
along
lasses
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
not
quite
creamy
but
close
the
flavor
was
semisweet
with
the
maple
syrup
getting
a
fair
shake
but
not
overtaking
the
spices
which
was
my
fear
before
opening
it
the
potential
for
cloying
sweetness
existed
but
the
brewer
held
fast
properly
moored
alongside
in
siamesefashion
i
settled
in
as
the
wench
proffered
pancakes
with
butter
and
syrup
and
a
hit
off
of
her
bottle
of
rum
yo
ho
ho
warming
i
began
to
sense
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
reminding
me
to
be
aware
of
its
abv
it
finished
with
a
warm
semisweetness
very
evocative
of
pumpkin
pie
i
kissed
the
mistress
requested
permission
to
go
ashore
and
headed
off
on
my
next
misadventure
pours
an
amber
caramel
color
with
a
finger
of
foamy
head
actually
really
nice
head
on
this
considering
the
abv
huge
sugary
sweet
aromas
maple
caramel
cinnamon
and
toffee
taste
is
really
nice
all
the
same
flavors
as
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
or
bourbon
maybe
its
just
a
tad
too
sweet
its
so
easy
to
drink
being
nearly
10abv
which
is
dangerous
i
find
myself
drinking
this
fast
overall
nice
pumpkin
brew
and
worth
a
visit
it
is
pretty
cool
to
see
this
beer
at
almost
every
bar
i
have
visited
and
that
saucony
creek
is
getting
love
from
the
local
markets
congrats
matt
mike
and
the
crew
o
im
very
surprised
but
this
is
fantastic
and
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
in
some
time
absolutely
worth
a
try
for
the
fall
season
as
i
sit
here
and
sip
this
beautifully
crafted
ale
i
gather
my
full
opinion
of
whats
going
on
inside
my
mouth
and
brain
not
only
is
maple
in
the
title
of
this
beer
but
maple
definitely
shows
itself
there
is
a
hint
of
something
different
which
would
be
the
butternut
squash
that
adds
just
enough
difference
to
separate
this
pumpkin
beer
from
the
next
another
piece
of
the
recipe
would
be
the
pirate
rum
spices
that
mix
so
perfectly
with
the
pumpkin
and
maple
creating
a
beautiful
brew
well
done
i
will
be
waiting
for
fall
next
year
o
its
ok
something
im
glad
ive
tried
the
maple
is
done
right
its
just
too
much
and
the
complexity
is
there
too
but
needs
evened
out
overall
very
nice
it
doesnt
seem
too
sweet
to
me
as
other
reviews
suggest
totally
solid
and
deceptively
drinkable
at
9
5
i
bought
this
on
a
whim
for
novelty
value
because
it
wasnt
too
expensive
i
found
it
so
good
that
its
one
of
the
few
pumpkin
beers
i
liked
so
much
id
buy
again
not
that
i
dislike
pumpkin
beers
but
ive
had
so
many
that
they
hardly
ever
stand
out
o
very
tasty
although
the
pumpkin
isnt
very
strong
certainly
not
next
to
other
pumpkin
ales
if
you
set
aside
that
expectation
you
wont
be
disappointed
other
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tried
and
liked
but
did
not
purchase
in
quantity
include
ufo
tommyknocker
ichabod
and
southampton
this
beer
has
a
brownish
color
body
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
of
malple
syrup
the
taste
has
a
subtle
pumpkin
flavor
that
is
balanced
with
the
maple
syrup
i
also
taste
a
little
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
just
a
little
thick
and
leaves
a
light
after
taste
on
the
tongue
o
too
sweet
on
the
maple
i
think
if
it
were
more
subdued
it
could
be
a
really
good
beer
that
said
it
was
more
enjoyable
than
i
anticipated
not
bad
overall
a
couple
bottles
every
fall
would
be
a
good
thing
d
a
fabulous
pumpkin
beer
that
doesnt
pull
any
punches
and
doesnt
even
attempt
to
hide
its
potent
9
5
abv
punch
a
delectable
sipper
to
say
the
least
what
a
terrific
offering
the
little
known
saucony
creek
brewery
i
will
be
sure
to
check
out
their
other
offering
when
provided
the
opportunity
if
push
came
to
shove
in
a
blind
taste
test
im
not
sure
i
would
peg
this
as
a
pumpkin
ale
but
rather
an
autumnal
seasonal
offering
with
some
barleywine
and
old
ale
characteristics
complex
assertive
and
quite
enjoyable
overall
a
really
enjoyable
fall
offering
from
a
local
brewery
there
was
much
more
going
on
in
this
brew
than
i
was
expecting
rumlike
flavors
not
an
overpowering
sweetness
or
pumpkin
flavors
spices
were
well
integrated
and
added
a
nice
layer
of
flavors
if
you
can
get
this
do
it
sweeter
than
expected
yet
had
a
heavier
alcoholey
taste
to
it
that
showed
every
bit
of
its
9
abv
definitely
an
autumn
beer
that
hits
you
in
the
middles
of
the
tongue
as
opposed
to
the
tip
of
the
tongue
or
the
back
and
lingers
there
for
quite
awhile
highly
recommended
for
any
pumpkin
pie
cinnamon
nutmeg
caramel
or
toffee
aficionados
my
only
regret
is
that
i
drank
it
all
before
thinking
to
write
a
review
it
is
always
great
to
buy
local
but
if
you
can
find
this
beer
i
recommend
it
overall
i
like
this
stuff
a
good
bit
its
not
a
favorite
but
im
a
solid
ipa
guy
that
being
the
case
a
few
non
ipas
have
made
my
hits
list
and
this
one
comes
close
to
cutting
the
mustard
but
its
just
a
tad
too
sweet
in
the
end
for
me
along
with
a
nicaraguan
cigar
or
some
type
of
seasonal
food
this
would
do
very
well
pumpkin
or
apple
pie
is
very
obvious
german
sausages
could
be
nice
as
well
or
something
with
anise
as
a
base
maybe
traditional
german
pork
and
kraut
like
on
new
years
i
highly
recommend
people
trying
the
other
beers
this
brewery
has
to
offer
this
beer
is
sweet
and
might
benefit
from
a
food
pairing
to
lessen
this
otherwise
it
is
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
quite
enjoyable
im
at
odds
i
kind
of
like
the
blend
and
flavor
but
it
finishes
on
the
cloyingly
sweet
side
with
a
syrupy
smack
that
leaves
you
with
a
sugar
high
halfway
through
id
hate
to
say
it
but
id
like
it
a
bit
drier
a
12
ounce
bottle
is
too
much
for
one
person
to
handle
split
it
with
a
friend
when
it
gets
folder
out
in
the
fall
and
maybe
the
warming
sweetness
will
fair
better
hides
the
alcohol
well
its
okay
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
styles
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
new
bottle
from
saucony
creek
the
bartender
at
the
fleetwood
grille
also
rimmed
our
glasses
with
a
cinnamon
brown
sugar
mix
which
enhanced
the
experience
you
could
definitely
taste
the
butternut
squash
and
the
maple
finish
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
but
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
nice
the
mix
between
the
lemon
and
the
pumpkinfall
spice
is
something
ive
never
seen
and
so
it
was
a
unique
experience
one
that
was
quite
tasty
i
would
consider
getting
this
beer
in
augustseptember
as
a
seasontransition
beer
had
this
last
fall
with
some
pizza
was
a
lot
better
than
expected
better
than
sam
and
all
the
other
readily
available
pumpkin
beers
out
there
overall
not
quite
as
bad
as
i
expected
delivers
what
it
expected
plenty
of
lemonade
and
lemon
shandy
with
lots
of
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
although
all
fake
and
macro
beer
like
but
despite
being
decent
and
delivers
what
it
expects
its
still
not
very
enjoyable
and
tastes
fake
so
pound
it
and
move
on
or
maybe
even
dump
it
when
i
get
sick
of
it
soon
overall
i
dont
love
pumpkin
beer
or
shandy
but
combining
the
two
makes
them
surprisingly
palatable
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
fairly
good
overall
though
probably
not
something
i
would
regularly
get
delicious
my
favorite
beer
looking
forward
to
next
fall
great
pumpkin
flavor
and
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
was
it
just
me
or
is
this
thing
pretty
good
never
would
have
thought
to
do
a
pumpkin
shandy
but
the
lemonade
aspect
of
this
does
a
lot
of
the
pumpkin
livens
it
up
without
the
need
for
fall
spices
which
i
guess
makes
it
pretty
unique
in
the
pumpkin
beer
world
also
are
these
guys
new
this
is
the
first
ive
seen
from
them
but
am
indigenous
to
the
area
its
clearish
and
rather
orange
strange
looking
really
especially
for
what
it
is
the
taste
is
nice
though
slightly
tart
from
the
citrus
rich
and
earthy
from
the
pumpkin
clean
in
the
finish
and
indeed
refreshing
im
not
sure
the
right
context
for
this
as
its
too
fally
for
hot
weather
with
the
squash
and
too
light
in
body
and
high
in
carbonation
for
a
hearty
fall
beer
so
its
sort
of
stuck
in
no
mans
land
out
in
the
middle
of
september
or
something
but
i
like
it
just
the
same
uniqueness
goes
a
long
way
with
me
and
this
is
certainly
that
also
appreciably
dry
instead
of
sweet
like
many
other
shandy
types
so
that
helps
it
stay
sessionable
for
me
extremely
strong
aroma
one
of
the
most
flavorful
pumpkin
beers
you
will
find
from
an
abc
mixed
six
it
was
terrible
poured
a
brown
color
almost
like
it
was
off
very
syrupy
sweet
like
fake
lemonade
bessie
had
to
finish
it
for
me
wasnt
crazy
about
this
something
about
wheat
and
pumpkin
just
dont
go
together
the
wheat
makes
this
beer
really
weird
and
almost
slimy
feeling
as
you
sip
when
combined
with
the
pumpkin
was
burping
up
pumpkin
spice
flavor
for
hours
long
after
i
had
half
a
bottle
and
not
in
a
good
way
just
wasnt
for
me
i
guess
sweet
pumpkin
pie
lots
of
cinnamon
mixed
in
worth
looking
for
o
one
of
the
worst
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
dont
bother
on
tap
at
world
of
beer
in
gainesville
pours
the
expected
orange
hue
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
aroma
of
nutmeg
sweet
gourds
and
more
nutmeg
im
not
getting
much
else
here
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
an
overly
spiced
nutmeg
basejust
like
almost
all
pumpkin
brewsand
a
little
bit
of
malt
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
thin
body
mouthfull
of
spices
feel
overall
this
is
better
than
the
average
pumpkin
brew
ive
had
but
thats
not
saying
much
really
sweet
and
is
the
truest
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
representation
ive
ever
tasted
it
really
does
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
with
whipped
cream
even
that
said
this
isnt
for
all
occasions
as
the
sweetness
may
be
too
much
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
jacko
traveler
shandy
brewed
by
the
traveler
beer
co
with
an
abv
of
4
40
this
brew
pours
out
a
nice
light
brown
color
with
a
bold
white
head
the
smell
is
rich
with
spices
and
pumpkin
you
also
pick
up
on
some
sweetness
in
the
smell
of
this
brew
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
the
smell
of
this
brew
jacko
traveler
shandy
taste
is
different
there
is
a
lot
going
in
this
brew
you
pick
up
on
many
spices
and
grains
in
this
brew
this
brew
is
also
sweet
it
puts
you
in
the
mind
of
cola
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
i
like
how
it
is
different
form
most
pumpkin
brews
on
the
market
jacko
traveler
shandy
has
nothing
overpowing
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
there
is
also
a
sweet
aftertaste
to
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
this
brew
is
a
good
drink
drew
serving
type
bottle
another
disappointing
pumpkin
seasonal
beer
light
with
little
taste
or
aroma
of
spices
ill
pass
really
had
no
taste
certainly
more
of
a
spiced
ale
than
either
s
pumpkin
beer
or
a
shandy
it
opens
with
tons
of
cinnamon
his
with
a
bit
of
pumpkin
and
malt
sweetness
then
lemon
adds
contrast
finishing
with
more
pumpkin
and
some
ginger
pored
into
nonic
glass
half
finger
head
dark
brown
almost
reddish
smelled
like
a
pumpkin
pie
decent
carbonation
spices
upfront
cinnamon
allspice
then
pumpkin
and
malt
follow
i
liked
it
a
little
but
it
looked
and
smelled
better
than
it
tasted
have
not
done
a
review
quite
like
this
one
before
but
i
am
just
going
to
cut
to
the
chase
the
lemon
just
doesnt
work
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
pumpkin
flavor
itself
is
not
bad
but
the
shandy
makes
it
too
sweet
it
starts
to
taste
more
like
a
fall
version
of
mikes
hard
lemonade
if
you
want
a
different
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
i
would
recommend
new
belgium
pumpkick
while
not
great
i
think
the
sour
tartness
from
the
cranberry
is
a
better
spin
this
one
is
fizzy
sweet
and
was
hard
to
finish
nice
and
refreshing
did
not
know
what
to
expect
but
just
the
right
mix
of
seasonal
spice
a
very
good
beer
it
has
excellent
taste
and
flavor
o
i
am
not
a
shandy
fan
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
can
put
up
with
to
drink
not
bad
but
not
great
i
love
pumpkin
beers
and
even
though
its
still
hot
where
i
live
it
feels
like
fall
to
me
with
a
wide
selection
available
right
now
unfortunately
this
one
let
me
down
it
is
a
shandy
and
the
label
does
not
hide
the
fact
that
it
isnt
going
to
taste
like
pumpkin
ales
so
i
cant
accuse
traveler
of
false
advertising
it
certainly
isnt
bad
but
theres
far
too
much
lemon
taste
in
my
opinion
it
tastes
like
a
sweet
lemonade
swallowed
with
a
mouthful
of
weak
pumpkin
pie
the
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
definitely
there
but
its
competing
too
much
with
the
lemon
it
was
definitely
worth
trying
because
all
pumpkin
beers
deserve
a
chance
but
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
im
in
the
store
delicious
light
and
refreshing
perfect
fall
beer
with
a
sweet
addition
of
pumpkin
nothing
like
the
traditional
pumpkin
ales
and
porters
of
fall
time
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
hints
of
nutmeg
perhaps
a
little
over
the
topstrong
but
pleasing
nice
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
o
slightly
sweet
for
a
pumpkin
beer
but
not
in
the
heavy
cloying
pumpkin
pie
way
but
very
easy
to
drink
much
more
refreshing
than
a
lot
of
other
pumpkin
beers
but
one
that
im
glad
i
grabbed
to
try
must
be
the
lemon
light
carbonated
sickening
sweet
flavor
made
the
mistake
of
buying
a
six
pack
neither
the
wife
or
me
could
make
it
through
one
ended
up
pouring
the
other
4
down
the
drain
tastes
like
a
pumpkinnut
muffin
not
a
bad
thing
but
with
a
light
body
some
lemon
and
prickly
high
carbonation
this
is
too
much
like
a
wine
cooler
great
flavor
that
came
through
in
smell
and
taste
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
very
sweet
to
much
very
pumpkin
pie
heavy
smells
great
if
you
wake
up
thankgiving
morning
yearning
for
a
pumpkin
pie
did
not
like
the
sweetness
i
am
surprised
this
works
as
well
as
it
does
a
bit
of
lemon
really
complements
the
pumpkin
spice
this
one
is
over
the
top
pumpkin
flavor
but
may
be
their
best
shandy
ok
this
is
the
most
interesting
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
the
color
and
head
lacing
etc
are
fine
the
taste
is
very
unique
it
has
a
cold
sweet
flavor
but
not
too
sweet
as
to
be
undrinkable
maybe
a
little
molasses
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
very
pronounced
and
it
is
not
masked
by
a
lot
of
nutmeg
or
cinnamon
which
a
lot
of
the
other
pumpkins
have
overall
nice
and
drinks
like
juice
more
than
beer
interesting
this
beer
tastes
like
diet
coke
overall
it
had
promise
its
flavors
were
strange
but
mild
worth
trying
if
you
love
molasses
in
beer
i
went
with
an
aggro
pour
to
try
and
stir
up
anything
that
may
have
flocculated
while
this
was
being
held
in
abeyance
i
still
only
mamaged
too
produce
a
finger
of
soapy
tawny
head
with
moderate
retention
as
a
result
color
was
an
orangishcopper
srm
9

with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
like
pumpkin
pie
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
allspice
i
did
not
really
get
lemon
but
thats
okay
since
it
would
be
kind
of
out
of
place
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
thin
which
is
common
to
shandys
apparently
the
flavors
were
kind
of
riotous
in
the
mouth
loads
of
spices
the
lemon
peel
asserting
itself
and
even
a
molasses
sweetbitterness
the
finish
was
semisweet
and
the
molasses
taste
overcame
the
spices
in
an
unexpected
twist
this
was
a
curious
drink
i
may
not
have
liked
it
as
much
in
the
fall
when
i
was
inundated
by
pumpkin
beers
but
as
an
outofseason
break
from
summer
seasonals
it
was
pretty
good
in
summation
this
was
a
really
enjoyable
beer
and
i
recommend
picking
up
a
6
pack
during
the
holidays
maybe
just
to
share
with
any
family
and
friends
who
arent
avid
beer
drinkers
its
good
try
it
such
a
surprising
and
fun
taste
that
its
almost
a
spoil
to
say
that
it
is
alcoholic
even
at
less
than
5
5
a
really
friendly
beer
dont
take
it
too
seriously
because
it
is
meant
to
be
a
holiday
palate
stimulator
to
get
you
ready
for
thanksgiving
really
great
for
the
fall
season
remember
to
judge
it
as
it
is
supposed
to
be
judged
a
seasonal
candy
beer
low
in
abv
that
is
merely
supposed
to
taste
good
and
get
your
taste
buds
ready
for
thanksgiving
o
i
wasnt
sure
about
the
concept
of
a
pumpkin
shandy
it
was
actually
better
than
expected
but
not
something
id
go
after
again
a
different
switch
up
in
the
pumpkin
ale
category
overall
a
good
experiment
that
i
didnt
think
would
work
better
than
expected
and
refreshing
drink
it
fast
though
because
it
is
best
cold
i
was
curious
now
i
am
all
set
i
highly
recommend
overall
holy
pumpkin
and
yam
pie
too
sweet
for
me
overall
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
so
far
new
favorite
for
me
o
very
interesting
you
definitely
get
both
the
pumpkin
beer
and
shandy
aspects
it
works
fairly
well
together
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
from
the
shandy
part
good
enough
for
a
single
its
definitely
unique
and
oneofakind
overall
well
coming
into
this
i
wasnt
really
expecting
much
the
beginning
of
this
was
actually
not
bad
at
all
quite
impressive
but
the
further
i
dove
into
this
the
less
interested
in
it
i
was
not
bad
for
a
beginner
a
let
down
for
others
nothing
really
pulled
me
into
this
so
i
gotta
finish
up
with
better
luck
next
time
cheers
overall
a
quite
sweet
pumpkin
brew
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
go
to
if
you
are
looking
for
something
sweeter
and
pumpkin
flavored
lemon
flavors
tend
to
take
over
the
taste
as
well
for
an
autumn
brew
this
tastes
more
like
a
summer
with
a
little
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
sprinkled
in
cinnamon
more
so
hey
theres
a
market
for
boones
farm
too
so
this
will
appeal
to
some
peoples
tastes
unfortunately
not
mine
overall
this
is
a
bad
beer
more
like
an
alcopop
decent
shandy
i
wouldve
never
thought
id
dig
this
o
4
0
great
fall
beer
the
first
day
this
fall
the
temp
does
not
exceed
80
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
drank
from
a
12
oz
bottle
first
thing
that
popped
out
was
the
nice
and
pleasant
smell
overall
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
good
taste
with
subtle
hint
of
lemon
not
very
bitter
or
hoppy
in
fact
not
at
all
good
body
and
not
too
strong
of
an
after
taste
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
worthy
of
being
on
this
website
tastes
strongly
of
pumpkin
and
spices
if
you
are
looking
for
a
subtle
spice
taste
then
this
might
not
be
for
you
nose
is
like
pumpkin
pie
with
a
spicy
gourd
and
creamy
scent
the
flavor
emulates
the
nose
but
with
a
slightly
thin
texture
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
are
strong
with
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
the
creamy
gourd
like
flavor
gives
one
the
impression
of
pureed
pumpkin
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
especially
for
the
price
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
on
the
market
and
absolutely
the
only
one
that
actually
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
and
in
a
good
way
not
sure
why
this
is
so
popular
the
best
fall
beer
ever
hands
down
ever
very
pumpkin
with
not
overwhelming
spice
but
theres
an
offputting
tangy
character
nice
toasted
finish
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
i
am
absolutely
obsessed
with
fall
and
plan
to
drink
one
of
these
each
day
of
october
i
love
it
delicious
another
beer
courtesy
of
the
legendary
woodychandler
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a

color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
pumpkin
some
mild
spices
taste
is
good
pumpkin
nutmeg
subtle
spices
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
beer
was
not
overspiced
as
many
pumpkin
beers
are
tasty
and
enjoyable
the
crack
was
nice
and
loud
and
the
inverted
glug
went
beautifully
producing
two
fingers
of
dense
lightorangish
head
that
put
me
in
mind
of
the
froth
on
an
orange
julius
do
they
even
make
those
any
more
color
was
a

orangishamber
srm

nose
seemed
heavily
dosed
with
nutmeg
although
i
could
also
smell
cinnamon
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
thin
but
i
liked
that
they
had
not
overdone
it
with
the
spices
so
that
the
malt
had
a
chance
to
come
through
i
was
reminded
of
a
christmas
cookie
spiced
but
with
a
bready
quality
also
finish
was
semisweet
the
result
of
the
admixture
of
the
spices
with
the
malts
it
was
not
the
best
version
of
the
style
that
i
tried
over
the
course
of
the
season
but
neither
was
it
the
worst
overall
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
has
the
right
flavors
but
on
the
lighter
side
would
be
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
of
these
nearly
sessionable
a
decent
representative
of
the
style
cheers
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
ale
nothing
especially
different
or
unique
but
i
enjoy
that
it
is
not
overspiced
like
other
pumpkin
beers
o
the
nose
is
absolutely
stunning
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
could
go
for
more
complexity
with
a
stronger
presence
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
overall
though
its
hard
to
complain
i
love
this
time
of
year
the
colors
the
weather
usually
and
the
pumpkin
beer
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
its
a
close
second
behind
southern
tiers
pumpking
for
me
though
this
one
has
a
oneup
on
pumpking
its
availability
easy
to
obtain
easy
to
session
and
easy
to
love

with

some

overall
a

o

this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkins
ive
had
this
year
out
of
about
5
or
6
breweries
ofallon
continues
to
please
o
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
well
balanced
and
authentiic
pumpkin
flavor
as
opposed
to
only
pumpkin
spice
flavors
that
most
carry
would
definitely
buy
again
if
given
the
opportunity
pours
a
burnt
orange
with
a
one
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
smells
great
you
really
get
the
sense
of
fall
from
the
aroma
goes
down
smooth
with
a
pumpkin
pie
taste
a
little
sticky
on
the
tongue
with
little
to
no
aftertaste
overall
its
not
bad
a
decent
fall
beer
not
the
best
flavored
beer
ive
had
but
theres
not
too
much
i
can
complain
about
here
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
wanting
to
try
something
new
the
look
is
lacking
but
the
taste
is
amazing
a
must
have
for
this
time
of
year
brown
in
color
with
good
clarity
there
is
good
carbonation
but
the
head
quickly
dissipates
aroma
is
heavily
pumpkin
pie
spices
i
also
get
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
faint
nutmeg
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
fairly
carbonated
the
taste
is
very
much
pumpkin
pie
spice
with
a
bit
of
cinnamon
its
a
bit
fleeting
and
then
gone
i
appreciate
the
lack
of
coriander
but
this
isnt
as
good
as
i
had
remembered
overall
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
offering
the
aroma
is
fantastic
on
this
one
but
it
doesnt
deliver
after
that
still
would
probably
pick
this
up
again
once
a
year
o
an
absolutely
awesome
pumpkin
beer
that
could
be
one
of
the
best
if
they
just
made
this
a
bit
thicker
it
would
really
drive
this
one
home
as
it
stands
its
just
a
bit
watery
feelwise
for
me
appears
copper
orange
in
the
body
with
a
cream
khaki
head
flowing
thick
unexpected
spice
comes
up
and
hits
me
in
the
face
pumpkin
spice
including
the
clove
vanilla
and
nutmeg
notes
usually
only
found
in
a
pumpkin
pie
flavor
is
straight
spice
minimal
malts
from
the
base
beer
this
relies
heavily
on
the
spice
additions
minimal
hints
of
gourd
that
may
or
may
not
have
been
there
for
the
brewing
process
body
is
medium
the
carbonation
is
flowing
thick
in
this
beer
im
actually
amazed
by
the
pumpkin
and
spice
combo
compared
to
other
standard
abv
versions
im
getting
a
fuller
bodied
creamy
carbonation
pretty
solid
but
still
not
something
i
would
seek
out
overall
nice
fun
beer
hopefully
it
opens
up
a
bunch
when
it
warms
up
o
this
was
my
top
pick
from
last
years
pumpkin
beers
tied
with
wolavers
and
this
year
it
doesnt
disappoint
i
still
find
it
much
better
than
pumpking
if
youre
into
pumpkin
seasonals
this
is
worth
having
the
aroma
is
good
and
theres
a
nice
complexity
here
mouthfeel
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
and
a
little
too
sticky
to
boot
overall
at
9
99
a
six
pack
im
disappointed
its
not
bad
but
with
so
many
pumpkin
ales
out
there
i
hoped
that
this
would
be
more
bold
with
bigger
pumpkin
flavors
stronger
spices
and
a
slightly
thicker
mouthfeel
i
wont
buy
this
again
it
being
august
im
not
so
upset
that
the
beer
is
as
light
as
it
is
but
i
wouldnt
like
this
too
much
in
november
this
pours
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
only
a
slight
head
there
is
a
scent
of
pumpkin
and
spice
but
it
is
rather
mild
the
taste
is
rather
simple
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
there
is
a
raw
pumpkin
flavor
with
a
few
pie
and
clove
spices
this
brew
drinks
fairly
light
and
smooth
the
after
taste
is
a
little
metallic
there
could
be
some
improvement
in
the
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
though
fairly
average
not
too
much
carbonation
overall
a
decent
choice
if
youre
looking
for
a
fall
inspired
drink
poured
from
standard
12oz
bottle
was
medium
to
medium
dark
copper
in
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
head
but
was
a
very
small
head
seemed
quite
carbonated
had
a
slight
pumpkin
smell
but
not
much
at
all
the
pumpkin
didnt
really
come
through
in
the
taste
it
was
way
too
subtle
and
seemed
watered
down
just
an
average
or
slightly
below
average
pumpkin
beer
overall
about
what
id
expect
for
a
pumpkin
beer
the
aroma
is
really
good
probably
one
of
the
best
traits
of
this
brew

and
herbal
lingering

a
bit
good
robustness
of
flavor
with
decent
balance
spices
are
not
overdone
at
all
minimal
cloying

flavors
after
the

body
with
a
lightly
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
almost
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
really
good
pumpkin
ale
taste
did
not
live
up
to
the
aromas
but
it
was
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
definitely
enjoyed
this
and
it
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
overall
not
bad
i
didnt
expect
much
a
bit
flat
and
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
too
much
cinnamon
and
sugar
that
overpowers
almost
everything
else
serving
type
bottle
o
not
too
bad
this
one
is
on
the
lighter
side
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
but
its
still
worth
trying
got
to
support
missouri
brewers
o
overall
a
great
pumpkin
ale
one
of
the
best
tasting
i
have
had
thus
far

vintage
is
superior
to
2012
vintage
cloudier
slightly
heavier
body
significantly
more
spice
still
on
the
lighter
side
of
the
style
but
a
lot
less
spritzy
an
excellent
choice
mouthfeel
very
light
in
the
mouth
the
beer
seems
to
move
over
the
tongue
with
ease
the
bubbles
cause
it
to
feel
lighter
than
it
is
nothing
special
about
this
but
very
pleasant
i
hate
when
a
pumpkin
beer
is
overspiced
and
this
one
is
definitely
subtle
which
i
appreciate
overall
this
is
the
best
tasting
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
the
other
ratable
aspects
need
a
little
help
but
this
is
certainly
worth
getting
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
cheers
d
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
i
love
a
pumpkin
beer
that
can
balance
the
pumpkin
and
the
spices
and
this
one
balanced
the
two
better
than
any
other
ive
had
this
year
if
the
mouthfeel
was
better
carbonation
lower
this
would
be
really
drinkable
unfortunately
not
the
case
thats
ok
though
because
this
is
the
best
one
ive
had
this
year
to
date
trying
a
good
bit
tomorrow
though
so
well
see
how
it
holds
up
good
stuff
i
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
from
this
beer
but
it
delivered
the
goods
and
while
this
is
not
a
rich
beer
i
dont
think
ive
found
another
one
that
so
accurately
captures
the
profile
of
actual
pumpkin
pie
and
its
not
oversaturating
i
think
i
could
put
away
a
few
of
these
a
fairly
light
sweet
pumpkin
ale
i
dont
really
appreciate
this
version
of
the
style
theres
not
enough
malt
backbone
and
its
sweetness
hits
overkill
overall
obvious
changes
need
to
be
made
like
making
the
nose
a
better
representation
of
the
taste
profiles
o
this
is
a
sleeper
pumpkin
beer
imo
i
love
this
style
and
have
tracked
down
quite
a
few
this
season
and
this
beer
blew
away
my
expectations
the
most
this
far
because
i
want
expecting
much
would
come
back
to
this
again
actually
i
will
pick
up
a
6pk
my
next
drive
through
ky
o
not
bad
at
all
pumpkin
ales
tend
to
be
an
acquired
taste
and
in
terms
of
quality
they
are
often
hit
or
miss
this
is
one
of
the
better
and
more
readily
available
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
turn
it
down
especially
on
a
cool
autumn
day
overall
not
a
bad
beer
in
and
of
itself
but
also
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
pumpkin
ale
too
light
in
body
not
enough
malt
and
not
enough
robust
spiciness
this
one
would
be
interesting
to
trying
sidebyside
with
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
probably
quite
a
contrast
moreys
bottom
line
this
isnt
a
must
have
for
me
but
its
certainly
drinkable
and
pretty
enjoyable
too
i
would
recommend
this
as
an
introduction
into
the
style
ofallon
pumpkin
pours
out
a
hazy
bronze
color
with
a
head
of
fine
bubbles
which
gives
way
quickly
into
fine
carbonation
bubbles
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
true
to
ofallons
design
this
beer
smells
of
rich
pumpkin
pie
with
very
light
hints
of
nutmeg
and
clove
in
the
background
the
beers
taste
changes
throughout
the
drink
as
soon
as
the
beer
hits
your
tongue
youll
be
greeted
by
sweet
pumpkin
and
malt
tastes
in
the
middle
of
that
drink
youll
feel
a
pop
of
the
pumpkin
spices
most
notably
the
cinnamon
then
on
the
very
end
of
the
swallow
the
beer
rounds
off
nicely
again
with
sweet
malts
and
pumpkin
with
only
11
ibus
of
hop
bitterness
dont
expect
this
beer
to
be
anything
less
than
a
malt
and
pumpkin
showpiece
whats
more
with
a
mouthfeel
that
is
relatively
light
and
an
approachable
5

abv
this
is
a
great
sessionable
pumpkin
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangish
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
head
which
recedes
to
nothing
with
very
little
lace
the
aroma
is
of
pumpkins
and
nutmeg
with
a
hint
of
cinnomon
the
taste
comes
out
with
a
nice
pumpkin
flavor
with
a
hint
of
nutmeg
and
cinnomon
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
others
and
not
a
big
a
flavor
as
others
but
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
was
moderately
carbonated
but
missing
something
overall
the
beer
was
solid
it
wasnt
best
in
class
but
a
good
pumpkin
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
borderline
disappointing
it
doesnt
have
the
full
creaminess
of
a
nice
mealy
pumpkin
pie
maybe
i
should
just
get
off
my
ass
and
make
a
pumpkin
pie
then
that
being
said
this
is
an
ok
pumpkin
brew
it
scratches
my
jackolantern
soup
itch
but
doesnt
dig
in
and
scrape
it
out
o
i
picked
this
up
at
the
grocery
for
1
50
and
seeing
the
twisttop
bottle
gave
me
the
notion
i
was
going
to
get
something
similar
to
the
blue
moon
harvest
pumpkin
which
i
sampled
not
too
long
ago
however
this
beer
does
the
style
justice
its
a
great
example
of
a
pumpkin
beer
at
a
good
price
overall
this
is
a
pretty
impressive
pumpkin
ale
that
is
easier
drinking
than
many
of
its
counterparts
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
super
spiced
versions
of
this
style
so
it
suited
me
quite
well
with
thanks
to
nlabruyere
got
to
try
this
one
from
a
fresh
batch
been
on
a
pumpkin
ale
kick
and
have
had
many
to
compare
this
to
this
one
has
the
typical
orangy
brown
appearance
it
looks
thin
has
a
small
amount
of
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
aroma
is
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
and
pumpkin
the
best
part
of
this
brew
is
the
authentic
pumpkin
in
the
flavor
which
is
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
this
is
pumpkin
with
accompanying
spices
rather
than
the
opposite
which
sadly
is
typically
the
norm
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
has
some
mild
creaminess
id
love
to
try
an
oaked
version
of
this
this
is
above
average
for
the
style
fo
sho
not
a
bad
brew
definitely
a
step
above
most
pumpkin
beers
i
have
tried
overall
ofallons
pumpkin
ale
is
lightyears
away
from
schlaflys
i
live
in
saint
louis
and
so
i
will
always
get
schlaflys
pumpkin
before
i
get
this
one
fairly
drinkable
and
a
noble
effort
but
it
just
writes
a
check
in
the
nose
that
the
taste
cant
cash
o
not
super
impressive
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
another
pumpkin
beer
soon
cause
i
really
like
the
idea
unfortunately
this
beer
has
officially
turned
me
off
to
ofallens
there
5
ipa
wasnt
as
good
as
advertised
and
this
beer
wasnt
good
o
an
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
i
feel
the
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
is
much
superior
as
far
as
the
local
offerings
go
but
this
one
is
more
drinkable
and
better
suited
for
sitting
around
the
fire
pit
while
passing
out
candy
to
trickortreaters
o
ofallons
pumpkin
beer
is
an
uppermiddle
class
entry
into
the
style
its
also
one
of
the
few
pumpkin
ales
that
i
could
have
more
then
one
of
in
a
sitting
if
you
enjoy
the
pumpkin
offerings
i
wouldnt
think
twice
of
picking
up
a
sixer
on
a
chilly
autumn
afternoon
overall
nicely
balanced
pumpkin
beer
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
not
overspiced
would
love
a
little
more
body
of
this
thing
but
i
wont
complain
too
much
will
drink
again
mouthfeel
is
a
little
clingy
with
a
slight
pumpkin
pie
flavor
and
an
off
dry
finish
not
bad
not
complex
perfect
drinking
beer
for
the
season
nice
balance
and
pleasant
o
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
ever
had
everything
is
there
from
the
pumpkin
pie
spice
the
malty
character
and
the
carbonation
and
the
most
important
part
is
that
they
are
all
well
balanced
all
in
all
a
respectable
refreshing
beer
however
if
you
want
a
good
pumpkin
beer
you
should
look
elsewhere
in
my
opinion
this
stuff
simply
isnt
in
the
same
league
as
schlaflys
mouthfeel
and
overall
light
to
medium
bodied
heavily
carbonated
spoton
tasty
pumpkin
pleasant
and
smooth
with
great
spices
added
in
overall
its
a
pumpkin
beer
really
delicious
if
you
like
pumpkins
which
i
do
but
it
does
leave
a
bit
to
be
desired
i
love
ofallons
in
general
and
what
they
do
but
i
think
a
bit
more
perfecting
would
bring
this
beer
up
to
an
a
and
even
as
it
is
its
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
available
o
a
better
job
than
most
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tried
still
not
great
but
i
like
ofallon
overall
and
this
one
is
a
decent
effort
the
taste
starts
with
pumpkin
followed
by
some
spices
the
aftertaste
has
a
nice
pumpkin
desert
like
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
and
full
of
flavor
and
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
a
must
this
fall
and
every
fall
in
the
future
o
dogfishs
punkin
ale
is
my
standard
for
this
style
and
this
is
not
that
that
said
its
solid
and
decently
drinkable
for
the
style
if
someone
handed
me
a
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
to
go
along
with
one
of
these
id
be
content
solid
not
a
must
have
o
not
too
bad
there
are
however
several
other
pumpkin
beers
that
i
like
better
that
i
would
buy
before
i
bought
this
one
again
overall
a
great
dessert
beer
and
a
great
fall
beer
i
am
definitely
picking
up
a
sixpack
of
this
when
the
harvest
moon
rolls
through
very
tasty
and
well
done
od
this
is
a
tasty
beer
one
that
im
enjoying
immensely
easy
to
drink
un
the
summer
though
its
making
me
ling
for
hoodie
weather
and
cool
weather
runs
pumpkin
beer
deux
do
easy
drinking
pumpkin
beer
right
here
really
packs
the
flavor
into
its
relatively
tiny
abv
appearance
leaves
something
to
be
desired
minor
ding
recommended
to
those
who
may
have
given
up
on
the
style
this
is
an
easy
drinking
pumkin
beer
with
flavors
that
blend
pretty
well
this
beer
came
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
developed
some
head
but
head
retention
was
minimal
the
beer
is
slightly
hazy
but
not
totally
untypical
for
a
pumpkin
ale
the
color
of
the
ale
was
a
copper
to
slightly
orange
like
hue
in
my
opinion
the
perfect
color
for
a
pumpkin
ale
the
ale
has
an
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
most
of
which
is
nutmeg
but
there
are
hints
of
cinnamon
and
clove
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
aroma
by
using
more
spice
but
at
any
rate
its
very
nice
the
beer
it
self
has
excellent
mouthfeel
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
when
drinking
this
you
immediately
get
the
pumpkin
pie
spice
but
it
disappears
too
quickly
and
finishes
with
a
slightly
caramel
taste
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
brew
and
there
are
so
few
excellent
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
ofallon
did
a
good
job
of
carefully
balancing
hops
with
the
spices
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
that
i
have
had
to
date
but
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
a
bold
spice
taste
this
is
a
safe
beer
but
ofallon
should
be
proud
of
it
it
knocks
the
socks
of
of
abs
mass
produced
version
i
will
be
buying
this
again
prost
this
is
simply
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
it
has
a
strong
spice
flavor
and
a
lot
of
pumpkin
flavor
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
kick
i
liked
it
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
every
day
it
was
great
for
thanksgiving
and
i
drank
a
sixpack
over
the
thanksgiving
week
would
i
buy
more
not
right
now
but
next
year
i
would
probably
buy
more
dgo
into
this
one
planning
on
drinking
an
amber
ale
and
youll
be
fine
but
from
a
pumpkin
ale
standpoint
it
falls
short
taste
is
buttered
pumpkin
pie
and
not
quite
as
bad
as
the
nose
as
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
that
when
combined
with
a
tad
bit
of
pumpkin
actually
reminds
me
a
bit
of
candy
corn
on
the
other
hand
this
might
ruin
candy
corn
for
me
the
feel
is
quite
bad
and
creamy
i
cant
stomach
much
of
this
drainpour
and
f
fairly
middle
of
the
road
for
pumpkin
ales
in
my
opinion
it
could
use
to
be
bolder
pours
an
eversoslightly
hazy
gold
with
a
tan
head
carbonated
ok
smell
is
mineral
and
pumpkin
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
a
sharp
spiciness
taste
is
very
wellrounded
i
really
like
the
fact
that
i
taste
more
pumpkin
than
spices
the
finish
is
dry
and
smooth
with
more
pumpkin
flavor
and
a
nice
dash
of
cinnamon
right
at
the
end
drinkability
is
as
easy
as
eating
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
all
in
all
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
ive
sampled
yet
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
half
a
finger
of
off
white
head
this
beer
is
orangeamber
in
color
the
smell
is
caramel
malt
with
pumpkin
spice
the
initial
taste
is
pumpkin
pie
it
later
fades
to
caramel
malt
it
is
an
alright
beer
its
worth
a
try
d
never
again
it
just
is
too
mediocre
to
really
want
again
i
can
think
of
half
a
dozen
other
pumpkin
beers
id
like
to
have
in
its
place
and
that
is
just
off
the
top
of
my
head
too
many
errors
and
things
need
fixing
that
i
addressed
above
d
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
lacking
in
depth
but
easy
enough
to
drink
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
too
off
to
make
this
easy
to
put
away
this
beer
pours
like
any
other
beer
and
looks
like
any
other
beer
but
unfortunately
thats
where
it
ends
it
has
a
bad
smell
but
i
dont
like
pumpkins
so
ultimately
this
beer
review
may
not
be
fair
the
smell
of
pumpkin
and
spice
is
over
whelming
and
not
good
taste
is
not
as
overpowering
as
the
smell
and
if
i
hold
my
nose
and
drink
it
isnt
nearly
as
bad
overall
i
really
dont
like
it
at
all
it
stinks
but
to
be
fair
to
ofalllon
i
dont
like
fruitvegetable
beers
fyi
the
current
label
has
a
cartoon
jackolantern
on
it
drinks
about
average
there
are
other
pumpkins
i
like
better
but
this
ones
not
bad
at
all
the
pumpkin
character
is
great
in
this
beer
but
it
is
just
dragged
down
my
everything
else
about
the
beer
i
think
this
beer
tried
too
hard
to
be
the
next
pumking
and
it
just
comes
off
in
an
awkward
fashion
d
good
but
not
amazing
lots
of
pumpkin
flavor
but
the
bit
of
tang
in
it
seems
out
of
place
to
me
nice
pumpkin
and
spice
aromas
with
this
hazy
light
orange
brew
i
let
this
one
warm
a
bit
and
the
flavors
came
through
more
fully
well
balanced
pumpkin
spice
malts
and
hops
with
this
one
quite
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
another
fine
midwest
pumpkin
brew
thanks
to
trader
birchstick
for
this
one
cheers
this
is
a
pretty
drinable
beer
and
is
not
to
sweet
or
cloying
as
some
of
these
beers
can
be
d
one
of
the
easier
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
to
drink
but
its
not
because
of
the
taste
cheers
d
drinkable
if
one
can
tolerate
the
taste
mouth
feel
is
medium
in
body
mildly
carbonated
slightly
creamy
and
a
hint
of
oily
slickness
d
ya
couldnt
get
the
whole
bottle
down
just
screams
cheaply
made
to
me
d
not
overly
assertive
like
other
pumpkin
ales
makes
this
much
more
drinkable
than
some
examples
i
have
tried
in
the
past
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
without
becoming
too
overbearing
d
as
far
as
pumpkin
goes
pretty
darned
tasty
the
ofallon
pumpkin
pours

and
no

is
mostly
thanksgiving
spices
consisting
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
some
hoppy

round
out
the

taste
consists
of
light
pumpkin
pie
and
cinnamon
not
as
in
your
face
as
other
pumpkin
ales
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
drinkability
is
mediocre
this
beer
is
only
meant
for
about
a
2
month
window
of
the
year
when
consumers
are
in
the
fallturkey
day
mood
but
compared
to
other
pumpkin
ales
i
believe
it
is
very
competitive
drinkability
very
drinkable
doesnt
fatigue
the
taste
buds
as
quickly
as
most
pumpkin
beers
and
at
5
5
abv
you
can
enjoy
several
at
a
sitting
drinkability
ive
definitely
had
better
that
would
be
much
more
worth
my
time
and
money
overall
this
is
certainly
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
not
mindblowing
but
i
may
get
another
6pack
this
season
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
will
not
disappoint
drinkability
is
great

cloudy

with
off

which
was
a
little
thick
smell
was
sweet

a
good

was
good

with

pumpkin
taste
really
came
out
more
once
it
warmed
up
a
little
this
is
a
really
decent
pumpkin

d
a
downright
delicious
and
drinkable
beer
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
d
this
are
very
easy
to
drink
and
make
me
anticipate
the
upcoming
holiday
season
a
hazy
light
copper
color
pour
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
rather
quickyl
medium
carbonation
a
little
spotty

is
lightly
sweet
with
notes
of
pumpkin

as
promised
a
hint
of
toasted
grain
and
if
you
let
it
warm
you
get
this
faint
hint
of
baked
pie
crust
very
subtle
flavor
is
rather
light
a
nice
blend
of
light

and
punkin
pie
a
little
kiss
of

little
if
any
bitterness
very
balanced
nice
bubbly
mouthfeel
light

very
sessionable
i
would
say
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
good
brew
and
a
fun
try
drinkability
very
good
pumpkin
beer
everything
is
very
well
balanced
worth
the
purchase
reminds
me
that
my
favorite
season
is
just
around
the
corner
karen
loves
this
beer
im
still
a
bigger
fan
of
pumpking
by
southern
tier
for
these
specialty
beers
i
want
more
meat
in
there
more
body
more
flavor
more
in
your
face
since
im
only
going
to
have
one
at
a
time
with
all
of
the
bad
pumpkin
beers
out
there
this
one
is
pretty
special
d
i
love
this
i
could
drink
this
slowly
all
night
long
this
is
a
really
fine
example
of
a
fall
seasonal
beer
of
all
the
pumpkin
ales
out
there
this
year
dont
pass
this
one
up
mouthfeel
fizzy
and
smooth
hands
down
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
they
nailed
it
this
year
very
much
reminds
me
of
pumpkin
pie
and
thanksgiving
its
august
and
i
will
now
be
annoyed
that
i
have
to
wait
3
months
damn
it
all
blipped
ghouls
night
out
by
the
misfits
drinkability
a
nicely
balanced
easydrinking
pumpkin
ale
though
i
fear
i
may
be
becoming
overly
acclimated
to
the
bolder
heftier
pumpkin
ales
e
g
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
southern

pumking
still
though
this
is
pleasant
also
congrats
to
little
jimmy

of
ms

ferguson

whos
winning
submission
provided
the
artwork
for
the
label
way
to
go
jimmy
third
beer
of
the
night
and
felt
that
half
was
enough
to
qualify
for
a
review
drinkability
about
average
drinks
okay
this
is
a
style
is
really
starting
wear
on
me
only
bigger
versions
of
this
seem
to
do
much
for
me
just
another
run
of
the
mill
pumpkin
beer
will
try
earlier
in
the
season
if
given
the
opportunity
serving
type
bottle
i
find
this
one
to
be
quite
drinkable
most
likely
by
mass
audiences
with
the
right
marketing
d
its
going
down
fine
but
im
not
terribly
inspired
to
have
another
hazy
pumpkin
copper
body
with
golden
edges
little
finger
of
gauzy
sticky
eggshell
white
head
good
lacing
caramel
and
cookie
malt
aromas
mix
with
pecan
pie
butter
rum
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
a
decent
wallop
of
cloves
toasted
malt
and
spices
up
front
slight
metallic
hop
flavor
somewhere
in
there
pulpy
pumpkin
pie
filling
taste
develops
complete
with
buttery
crust
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
slightly
tart
twang
in
the
background
light
honey
sweetness
in
the
finish
not
bad
maybe
a
prototypical
pumpkin
beer
which
is
not
my
favorite
style
i
tend
to
prefer
the
higher
abv
examples
due
to
the
bigger
sweeter
malt
backbone
drinkability
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
of
this
style
but
it
unique
and
i
like
that
if
i
was
not
in
the
mood
for
desert
style
pumpkin
beer
this
would
be
what
id
choose
drinkability
a
little
bit
light
on
the
flavor
and
aroma
side
was
hoping
for
more
but
still
a
pretty
decent
beer
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
an
orangeamber
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
average
the
aroma
is
nice
it
smells
like
pumpkins
nutmeg
and
cloves
its
not
too
spicy
theres
a
good
mix
between
the
pumpkin
and
spice
which
makes
the
aroma
enjoyable
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
however
theres
initially
a
slight
tartsour
flavor
which
does
go
away
after
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
carbonation
is
good
drinkability
is
decent
as
well
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
think
its
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
but
not
my
favorite
brew
in
the
style
either
with
that
being
said
i
would
pick
this
up
again
in
the
future
all
in
all
this
is
a
really
good
beer
for
the
season
i
havent
had
many
better
mouthfeel
is
light
but
with
heavy
flavors
easy
to
drink
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
overall
without
having
ever
had
a
pumpkin
beer
its
hard
to
compare
but
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
either
flat
or
just
flat
out
bad
bad
may
be
a
bit
strong
its
not
like
bud
light
or
anything
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
nutmeg
clove
and
big
cinnamon
in
the
taste
kind
of
bland
nutmeg
and
a
dry
cinnamon
a
spice
bite
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
nutmeg
spice
aftertaste
great
nose
yet
light
in
flavor
quite
dry
and
big
spices
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
with
ale
being
emphasized
i
will
probably
buy
some
more
of
this
but
i
have
to
give
the
nod
to
schlafly
for
being
my
favorite
local
pumpkin
ale
however
this
is
definitely
recommended
for
this
style
d
not
a
bad
ale
and
my
only
serious
criticism
is
the
poor
aroma
kudos
to
ofallon
for
attempting
to
not
overpower
the
ale
flavors
with
spices
i
really
like
this
to
me
its
pretty
much
the
perfect
pumpkin
ale
however
the
only
thing
i
would
change
is
the
amount
of
actual
pumpkin
flavor
it
needs
cranked
up
a
notch
this
isnt
the
most
dynamic
or
amazing
pumpkin
ale
but
its
highly
drinkable
and
none
of
the
spicing
is
overwhelming
which
is
the
downfall
of
many
of
these
ales
ill
definitely
try
this
one
again
d
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
low
to
moderate
flavor
is
unimpressive
really
not
quite
what
it
should
be
beer
is
sessionable
but
consuming
more
than
one
would
seem
to
be
a
horrible
idea
not
my
favorite
ofallon
brew
very
drinkable
due
to
the
aforementioned
balance
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
and
something
i
will
be
looking
for
come
fall
much
more
sessionable
than
many
examples
of
the
style
due
to
the
near
perfect
spice
balance
with
just
the
slightest
touch
of
nutmeg
the
abv
also
compares
favorably
for
sessioning
versus
bigger
examples
like
the
punkin
ale
this
is
some
good
stuff
from
ofallon
i
see
that
it
is
now
available
in
cans
another
one
for
the
want
list
slightly
hazed
copper
color
slight
head
aroma
is
of
muted
spice
spicey
flavornutmeg
and
cloves
faint
pumpkin
taste
somewhat
malty
flavor
ok
enough
mouthfeel
for
the
style
very
average
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
i
still
enjoy
trying
as
many
as
possible
to
find
the
right
one
base
or
the
liquid
ingredient
in
beer
can
turkey
it
had
to
be
tried
though
meh
d
spiced
beers
are
all
about
balance
and
this
one
is
balanced
quite
well
quite
drinkable
unlike
some
pumpkin
beers
this
one
actually
tastes
like
pumpkin
not
just
the
spices
associated
with
it
maybe
its
just
that
its
brewed
close
and
therefore
always
fresh
or
that
the
selection
in
my
area
isnt
very
good
but
every
fall
this
one
sticks
out
as
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
brews
so
many
of
them
are
just
way
too
spiced
d
a
middle
of
the
pack
pumpkin
ale
or
maybe
a
little
better
than
average
decent
enough
its
better
from
the
draught
a
fine
fall
brew
that
makes
for
an
all
right
transition
to
the
maltier
marzen
lagers
and
bocks
of
fall
overall
maybe
not
my
favorite
of
the
pumpkin
ales
but
not
bad
either
drinkability2to3
and
i
would
have
to
change
it
up
medium
in
build
with
a
flaccid
pasty
feel
its
bland
enough
yet
to
drink
quickly
but
its
flawed
and
not
worth
a
revisit
note
since
this
has
a
sort
of
mulledcider
vibe
i
tried
heating
half
of
a
bottle
up
in
a
coffee
up
dont
do
this
it
tastes
like
puke
i
dont
think
that
this
has
a
high
enough
abv
or
something
dark
orangebronze
color
with
very
little
to
no
head
i
see
very
small
floaters
lofting
around
in
my
glass
maybe
i
just
grabbed
a
dirty
glass
out
of
the
cupboard
smells
good
like
pumpkin
pie
pumpkins
nutmeg
cloves
the
taste
isnt
too
overwhelming
it
smells
stronger
than
it
tastes
it
feels
a
little
watery
and
flat
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
thanksgivinghalloween
novelty
beer
that
i
could
have
a
couple
of
during
those
times
of
year
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
beer
in
any
quantity
its
ok
d
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
this
one
is
very
drinkable
outside
of
schlafly
i
havent
found
one
i
can
really
get
behind
yet
basically
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
very
nice
and
smooth
with
the
dominant
pumpkin
flavor
from
beginning
to
end
theres
a
little
cinnamon
aroma
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
but
not
at
all
overdone
ofallon
pumpkin
ale
just
gets
better
and
better
every
year
i
need
to
hold
onto
a
six
pack
of
this
for
thanksgiving
well
done
ofallon
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
drinkability
tapered
off
quickly
overall
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
exactly
what
you
would
expect
and
want
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
brew
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
to
light
carbonation
texture
of
carbonation
is
fine
i
believe
that
the
spices
used
in
this
brew
cause
it
it
have
a
semidry
finish
this
is
a
beer
id
drink
again
however
i
much
prefer
dogfish
heads
punkin
ale
over
this
one
still
a
good
beer
though
d
what
a
treat
this
was
really
impressive
its
a
shame
these
kinds
of
beers
arent
more
popular
the
color
was
inviting
but
the
smell
was
immediatley
cinnamon
and
spice
the
taste
was
immediate
hot
cinnamon
like
red
hots
of
schnapps
the
cinnamon
overpowered
any
malt
or
hops
if
there
was
pumpkin
it
too
was
buried
in
cinnamon
i
am
a
guy
who
loves
cinnamon
and
use
it
every
chance
i
get
when
cooking
and
baking
but
the
beer
had
no
balance
i
will
try
it
again
and
would
encourage
others
who
enjoy
fruit
based
beers
to
give
it
a
try
hopefully
the
spices
can
be
tamed
down
and
the
beer
can
shine
through
much
like
there
other
styles
do
so
well
light
to
medium
bodied
not
a
bad
drinker
plain
and
simple
i
like
this
one
because
it
doesnt
have
the
overwhelming
pumpkin
pie
taste
of
some
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
the
delightful
softly
spicy
nose
of
ofallons
pumpkin
ale
is
a
good
indication
of
what
youll
find
within
its
clear
orange
body
and
creamy
yellowedwhite
head
its
not
overdone
with
spice
and
has
an
actual
pumpkin
flavor
to
it
amidst
its
gently
sweet
malt
components
cinnamon
seems
to
stand
out
as
far
as
the
spicing
goes
appearing
first
and
last
on
the
palate
but
the
clove
comes
on
strong
across
the
middle
and
the
nutmeg
is
clearly
visible
in
the
finish
remarkably
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
bottle
courtesy
of
northyorksammy
poured
a
light
yellowredish
color
ale
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
average
retention
but
good
lacing
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
cloves
is
about
medium
with
some
light
pumpkin
taste
of
cinnamon
and
cloves
dominated
the
taste
and
was
well
balance
with
some
light
pumpkin
light
body
with
some
good
carbonation
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
well
done
pumpkin
beer
but
probably
not
up
to
par
with
the
weyerbacher
one
which
i
still
think
is
the
best
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
amberbrown
with
no
head
to
speak
of
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
nutmeg
clove
and
cinnamon
as
expected
cinnamon
dominates
the
flavor
with
the
nutmeg
taking
a
backseat
lighter
body
than
expected
from
a
pumpkin
ale
on
the
dry
side
ok
pumpkin
ale
a
bit
dry
for
my
liking
but
a
nice
blend
of
spice
in
the
nose
and
not
overwhelming
in
the
taste
i
preferred
the
flavors
while
colder
well
balanced
and
an
easy
drinker
for
the
season
cheers
for
this
one
joe
much
appreciated
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
could
be
better
beer
taste
is
malty
and
carbonated
with
an
accent
of
spice
bottle
lists
cinnamon
clove
and
nutmeg
which
dont
all
resonate
distinctly
not
to
pick
it
apart
the
spice
element
is
reserved
and
it
lends
itself
greatly
to
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
carbonation
is
average
this
one
is
easily
sessionable
ive
had
three
today
already
and
could
have
another
good
autumn
seasonal
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
orange
color
with
virtually
no
head
good
carbonation
nose
is
terrific
cinnamon
cloves
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
slightly
doughy
like
a
good
pie
palate
is
consistent
with
the
nose
nice
spiciness
and
malt
sweetness
have
a
slight
bite
that
i
like
gingerlike
this
one
is
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
maybe
slightly
thin
but
good
over
all
residual
spiciness
lingers
on
the
tongue
slightly
sweet
finish
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
another
very
good
offering
from
ofallon
i
just
wish
they
had
better
labels
the
jackolantern
like
the
wheach
label
just
looks
a
little
silly
bad
labels
good
beer
ofallon
pumpkin
ale
is
a
very
nice
allrounder
in
a
style
that
often
suffers
from
too
much
or
too
little
ill
have
to
check
my
reviews
but
i
dont
believe
that
ive
had
a
better
pumpkin
ale
from
a
midwestern
brewer
bottom
line
this
one
is
easily
good
enough
to
warrant
a
sixer
every
autumn
the
body
is
good
and
a
bit
low
off
the
carbonation
overall
i
really
that
this
was
a
great
seasonal
beer
a
unique
flavor
with
more
of
a
pumpkin
appeal
then
a
more
traditional
pumpkin
ales
this
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
the
pumpkin
pie
aroma
is
present
though
subdued
flavor
slightly
sweet
and
clean
like
a
lager
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
spice
not
really
special
but
better
than
a
number
of
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
light
carbonation
definitely
drinkable
but
somewhat
forgettable
as
well
taste
was
spice
atop
a
sour
taste
actually
pretty
pleasant
i
enjoyed
the
sourspice
relationship
more
the
more
i
drank
although
i
didnt
especially
want
another
one
a
large
amount
of
sediment
was
also
left
in
the
bottom
of
my
glass
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
seems
to
have
a
vaguely
buttery
oily
mouthfeel
this
adds
to
the
enjoyment
of
drinking
the
beer
as
it
makes
the
flavors
last
longer
this
is
a
dam
fine
pumpkin
ale
and
i
could
see
kicking
back
several
of
these
in
an
evening
received
this
12oz
bottle
from
vancer
in
bif46
pale
orangetan
color
with
a
slight
chill
haze
barely
any
head
and
weak
carbonation
weak
aroma
with
only
a
hint
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spiciness
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
with
mild
pumpkin
spice
followed
by
the
tiniest
bitter
finish
nothing
too
exciting
here
the
mouthfeel
ran
a
bit
thin
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
drinkable
overall
this
pumpkin
ale
didnt
have
much
to
offer
its
very
light
and
the
classic
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
are
too
weak
it
might
be
worth
a
try
as
a
festive
fall
beer
bu
any
other
time
of
year
i
think
i
would
pass
notes
decent
but
too
busy
on
the
palate
d
this
beer
doesnt
have
any
overpowering
pumpkin
spice
flavors
infact
it
has
very
faint
spice
flavors
the
flavor
is
pretty
boring
and
bland
with
not
much
malt
flavor
or
other
characters
this
was
a
really
bad
boring
beer
one
of
my
top
two
of
this
style
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
then
this
is
a
must
try
only
my
second
pumpkin
ale
of
the
season
and
the
first
i
have
ever
had
this
particular
offering
color
is
a
hazy
amber
with
a
none
too
impressive
head
smell
is
mildly
spiced
nothing
really
in
your
face
taste
also
fails
to
really
impress
not
enough
of
a
spice
impact
im
not
asking
for
something
huge
just
something
palateable
mouthfeel
is
the
real
downfall
for
me
with
this
beer
too
watery
or
thin
drinkablity
is
fine
if
the
mouthfeel
is
not
an
issue
but
it
is
with
me
i
have
a
second
in
the
fridge
that
i
plan
on
passing
on
to
an
unlucky
visitor
dull
faded
orange
thin
off
white
head
lace
is
minimal
nice
aroma
of
sweet
pumpkin
pulp
not
a
lot
of
spicing
going
on
the
nose
but
thats
alright
too
many
overspiced
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
the
spicing
comes
through
a
little
more
on
the
palate
cinamon
and
ginger
lightly
compliment
the
nice
round
pumpkin
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
malts
add
some
sweetness
without
cloying
it
up
full
body
and
flavorful
nice
beer
sent
to
me
from
czoch75
thanks
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
smells
of
spices
like
cinnamon
and
cloves
tastes
like
liquid
pumpkin
pie
good
liquid
pumpkin
pie
really
nicely
balanced
finishes
good
overall
i
am
impressed
since
im
not
a
big
fan
of
beer
with
spices
since
i
kinda
expect
too
much
sweetness
and
spices
but
this
is
damn
good
i
cant
make
any
other
comparisons
to
the
style
but
i
may
now
have
to
try
a
few
others
just
to
see
which
is
best
as
a
rule
of
thumb
i
generally
stay
away
from
the
pumpkin
beer
but
a
friend
brought
it
over
so
i
had
it
a
try
poured
a
hazy
burnt
orange
amber
with
a
tiny
bit
of
carbonation
smells
sweet
some
cloves
cinnamon
nutmeg
as
it
says
on
the
bottle
and
maybe
a
little
pumpkin
funk
taste
is
about
the
same
accept
with
some
minor
hops
presence
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
because
of
its
abv
and
subtle
flavor
this
would
be
a
decent
sessioning
beer
over
all
not
bad
or
pretty
good
if
you
like
pumpkin
beer
honestly
if
pumpkin
beer
was
my
thing
id
search
out
better
alternatives
drinkability
above
average
vs
the
style
a
sessionable
beer
the
flavors
never
grate
but
are
quite
pleasing
pretty
good
beer
not
typically
a
fan
of
fruit
or
vegetable
beers
this
one
is
pretty
simple
and
pleasant
it
seems
that
the
brewers
begin
with
a
lightly
hopped
but
good
quality
pale
ale
and
then
added
the
pumpkin
additions
cloves
cinnamon
and
other
spices
the
beer
never
feels
weighted
but
not
under
malted
either
a
nice
fluffy
head
retention
and
soft
copper
hue
verifies
a
quality
base
brew
lightly
estery
and
mildly
hoppy
with
a
slight
grain
bite
finishes
quite
clean
with
a
mild
alcohol
pumpkin
and
spicy
note
not
my
every
day
beer
but
nice
for
the
season
from
the
bottle
poured
a
dark
honey
with
no
head
aroma
those
nice
pumkin
pie
spies
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
gloves
with
a
side
of
brown
sugar
some
hops
where
is
the
whip
cream
flavor
not
as
robust
as
i
was
hoping
for
had
a
hard
time
pulling
the
flavors
out
did
get
a
little
of
the
pumpkin
and
just
hint
of
the
spices
onther
than
that
it
was
a
easy
drinking
beer
wow
this
beer
is
pretty
damn
good
having
only
had
the
blue
moon
pumpkin
ale
before
this
one
i
was
not
expecting
too
much
this
beer
really
does
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
it
smells
wonderfully
pumpkiny
too
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
this
beer
next
fall
until
then
i
will
enjoy
it
while
i
can
im
a
bigger
fan
of
pumpkin
beer
than
most
so
i
that
while
say
that
ofallons
pumpkin
ale
isnt
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
its
still
worth
a
buy
a
mix
between
a
clear
pumpkin
skin
lager
hue
and
a
slightly
hazy
and
just
as
slightly
carbonated
apricot
ale
color
the
aroma
is
of
a
particularly
spicey
pumpkin
in
all
its
autumn
glory
the
taste
makes
me
think
of
hallowen
in
all
its
herbal
earthy
and
spicey
mischief
pllenty
of
light
malts
but
they
are
overtaken
by
the
pumpkin
fruityness
the
palate
is
a
light
spicey
more
like
from
a
halloween
scented
candle
than
a
beer
at
times
note
picture
is
not
current
new
label
has
pumpkin
in
center
4thoseabout2bock
and
i
did
a
blind
tasting
of
ofallon
dogfish
punk
and
new
holland
icabod
i
had
tried
all
3
within
the
past
week
and
was
able
to
identify
each
one
blind
we
both
preferred
ofallon
and
found
dogfish
punk
notably
inferior
to
the
others
despite
being
a
fan
of
punkin
in
past
years
his
will
never
be
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
so
far
this
would
be
my
pick
the
pumpkin
and
spices
are
just
about
right
to
enjoy
with
out
overpowering
definitely
worth
a
try
for
the
fall
season
roasted
pumpkin
skin
dense
almond
meat
colored
head
of
small
and
medium
sized
bubbles
that
settles
to
a
dusting
of
microfine
foam
and
left
no
lacing
definite
pumpkin
pie
spice
aromas
cinnamon
nutmeg
cloves
as
well
as
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
not
overpowering
but
rather
enjoyable
nice
and
rich
pumpkin
pie
leads
things
off
cinnamon
cloves
and
nutmeg
over
lay
a
modestly
sweet
malt
body
the
finish
is
more
spices
as
well
as
a
bit
of
biscuity
malt
that
lends
a
hint
of
pie
crustlike
completeness
i
can
picture
a
dollop
of
whip
cream
on
top
there
is
also
just
a
hint
of
hop
crispness
as
well
to
compliment
the
pie
sweetness
and
the
cinnamon
kind
of
stands
out
in
the
finish
mediumlight
body
with
a
smooth
minimally
carbonated
feel
it
has
just
enough
body
to
provide
a
bit
of
heft
but
is
not
overly
thick
and
cloying
like
some
pumpkin
ales
can
be
enjoyable
and
well
spiced
but
not
dominatingly
so
there
is
just
enough
to
you
know
you
had
a
piece
rather
than
the
entire
pie
da
very
good
pumpkin
ale
of
the
others
that
i
have
had
its
one
of
my
favorites
its
a
good
dessert
brew
for
sure
hrmm
not
my
favorite
style
to
begin
with
but
this
isnt
as
good
as
buffalo
bills
which
has
more
of
an
authentic
pumpkin
flavor
as
opposed
to
spice
not
inclined
to
buy
this
again
but
its
better
than
average
for
the
style
dark
copper
color
topped
by
an
off
white
head
the
beer
displays
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
but
he
head
recedes
quickly
into
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
light
it
shows
off
the
pumpkin
and
contains
just
a
bit
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
malt
comes
through
in
the
finish
the
flavor
has
more
depth
nice
pumpkin
flavor
up
front
balanced
nicely
with
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
ive
always
stated
that
to
have
a
good
pumpkin
beer
you
have
to
start
with
a
nice
base
definitely
true
in
this
case
the
ale
used
as
a
base
has
a
nice
fruitiness
and
a
light
caramel
nature
from
the
malt
the
mouth
feel
is
light
bordering
on
thin
but
as
stated
earlier
nice
carbonation
great
fall
beer
lowmedium
bodied
would
like
a
bit
more
chewiness
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
though
overall
this
pumpkin
beer
doesnt
try
to
impress
with
taste
or
complexity
its
more
of
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
if
anything
another
missed
opportunity
of
a
pumpkin
ale
the
base
beer
is
just
a
regular
old
nothing
of
a
golden
ale
light
and
lacking
a
lot
malt
depth
the
spices
are
on
showcase
here
and
i
guess
the
traditional
thinking
is
to
use
a
light
beer
and
let
the
spices
come
through
but
it
ends
up
being
a
dissapointment
just
spices
and
a
decently
balanced
beer
only
go
so
far
and
makes
this
beer
stop
short
of
being
great
i
wish
they
would
make
it
with
a
better
base
beer
i
would
love
to
see
a
porter
overall
i
liked
it
well
enough
but
i
wish
there
was
more
to
it
there
really
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
substance
to
this
beer
it
noticeably
lacks
a
richness
depth
that
the
best
pumpkin
ales
have
which
seems
to
be
a
common
problem
among
pumpkin
beers
it
just
comes
across
like
a
normal
nondescript
golden
ale
with
heavy
spices
oh
this
years
label
is
better
with
the
orange
jackolantern
on
it
topnoch
effort
from
the
areas
quirkiest
brewery
purchased
in
a
6pack
at
the
local
wild
oats
natural
food
store
which
also
has
a
decent
selection
of
beer
it
pours
a
beautiful
golden
orange
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
rather
murky
looking
it
smells
delicious
just
like
pumpkin
pie
smells
of
sweet
sticky
cinnamon
though
not
overpowering
with
nutmeg
and
of
course
pumpkin
fortunately
this
delicious
nose
is
manifested
in
the
taste
too
the
spices
are
all
there
along
with
considerable
malts
and
a
tinge
of
hops
i
can
see
how
this
would
be
too
sweet
for
some
people
but
i
love
it
medium
bodied
and
damn
drinkable
this
is
my
first
pumpkin
beer
and
it
freaking
rocks
i
cant
wait
to
try
others

the

of

very

the
mouthfeel
is
medium

with
a
bit
of
a
grittiness
it
seems
would
be
more
drinkable
with
a
bit
less
spicing
but
still
quite
quaffable
for
the
style
i
enjoyed
it
this
beer
makes
no
secret
of
trying
to
emulate
pumpkin
pie
and
it
does
a
good
job
first
you
see
it
is
has
the
same
coloringmurky
then
you
smell
it
it
has
the
same
spicing
then
you
taste
it
but
it
also
has
a
delicious
beer
side
too
it
with
assertive
sharp
hops
as
an
immediate
aftertaste
and
then
after
a
few
seconds
you
get
a
delicious
wam
pumpkin
pie
taste
in
your
mouth
you
will
also
notice
a
slight
yeastiness
that
is
not
at
all
unpleasant
and
actually
adds
to
the
mouthfeel
im
going
to
stock
up
on
these
the
next
time
i
go
to
hyvee
and
save
it
for
thanksgiving
this
beer
tastes
like
fall
and
if
youre
interested
in
the
head
its
not
very
high
or
longlived
and
it
has
an
offwhite
hue
the
bottle
is
full
of
yeast
so
decant
carefully
if
you
dont
like
this
my
one
qualm
is
that
they
didnt
fill
the
bottle
up
enough
which
erks
me
because
the
type
of
cap
they
use
is
one
of
a
handcapped
microbrew
and
they
shouldnt
be
cheap
bastards
ill
still
buy
it
though
recommended
pours
a
hazy
milky
orangeamber
with
bits
of
something
floating
about
pumpkin
i
presume
small
frothy
white
head
smells
of
gingerbread
cookies
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
tastes
vaguely
of
pumpkin
pie
squash
i
assume
thats
the
pumpkin
as
ive
never
actually
eaten
pumpkin
lots
of
spices
a
little
artificially
though
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
i
would
have
guessed
like
a
heavy
brown
ale
maybe
this
was
pretty
tasty
for
my
first
pumpkin
ale
well
see
how
it
matched
up
against
dogfish
punkin
ale
and
buffalo
bills
pumpkin
ale
i
know
this
is
not
the
highest
rated
pumpkin
beer
out
there
but
it
is
very
nice
and
doesnt
go
overboard
with
spices
mouthfeel
on
thin
side
of
medium
hops
stay
out
of
the
way
this
gets
it
a
lot
of
averageboring
ratings
i
still
like
its
subtile
flavors
and
find
this
fresh
fall
batch
very
drinkable
maybe
some
local
brewer
loyalty
thrown
in
the
mix
this
may
find
its
way
to
some
of
my
fall
trades
drinkability
quite
drinkable
pours
amber
orange
in
color
with
a
decent
head
that
retreated
to
a
thin
surface
covering
light
aroma
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
thin
mouthfeel
this
is
a
lackluster
pumpkin
ale
it
has
a
vegetable
not
even
pumpkin
taste
to
it
flavors
are
dominated
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
too
much
nutmeg
throws
off
the
balance
actually
there
is
no
balance
cinnamon
sweetens
this
otherwise
sleepy
beer
not
much
else
going
on
here
weak
first
pumpkin
ale
of
the
fall
season
i
look
forward
to
fall
on
the
beer
calendar
for
so
many
reasons
one
being
pumpkin
ales
this
one
however
better
not
be
a
sign
of
whats
to
come
this
year
this
beer
is
boring
the
appearance
is
a
clear
golden
with
a
rusty
body
the
aroma
is
decent
but
there
is
just
not
enough
of
it
when
i
am
having
a
pumkin
ale
i
want
the
spices
to
come
out
and
punch
me
in
the
face
this
one
is
very
timid
with
nutmeg
being
the
biggest
producer
of
smell
the
taste
is
very
thin
and
lacks
any
luster
small
hints
of
vanilla
and
cloves
find
their
way
through
but
it
is
incredibly
unappealing
thankfully
i
only
bought
two
bottles
of
this
in
my
honest
opinion
this
is
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
ab
or
miller
if
they
brewed
a
pumpkin
blahhh
this
is
boring
overall
this
isnt
at
all
a
bad
pumkin
beer
but
if
you
have
anything
else
as
an
alternative
you
might
have
better
luck
their
like
lakefront
pumpkin
when
i
finished
the
last
bottle
in
my
sixpack
i
found
it
did
hold
up
pretty
nicely
it
was
well
filtered
at
bottling
no
icky
sediment
on
the
bottom
spices
had
not
become
overpowering
but
added
to
the
malt
to
make
it
come
in
a
little
richer
i
wouldnt
want
to
hold
on
the
this
too
long
but
it
aged
well
medium
bodied
with
a
healthy
dose
of
bubbly
as
well
i
would
like
to
see
this
be
just
a
tad
fuller
in
the
mouthfeel
both
drinkable
and
enjoyable
ill
be
looking

the

are

well
with

rich
and

nothing
wrong
with
this
one

i
guess
with
a
small
tight
head
that
did
not
stick
around
nice
sturdy
malt
with
nondescript
but
adequate
hopping
reminded
me
of
an
amber
ale
but
a
bit
more
sweet
bottle
notes
brewed
with
cinnamon
clove
and
nutmeg
spices
were
noted
but
they
were
quite
reserved
a
background
flavor
playing
a
supporting
part
in
the
overall
flavor
profile
quite
nice
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
quite
tasty
thanks
to
clvand0
for
the
bottle
drinkability
a
downright
delicious
and
drinkable
beer
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
tried
this
sidebyside
with
buffalo
bills
pumpkin
ale
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
decent
sized
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
but
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
cinnamon
nutmeg
allspice
basically
smells
like
pumpkin
spices
but
subtle
not
too
overpowering
some
sweetness
as
well
tastes
very
good
excellent
blend
of
the
pumpkin
spices
slight
malt
character
but
the
pumpkin
takes
over
very
well
made
i
liked
this
one
much
better
than
the
buffalo
bills
but
not
nearly
as
well
as
the
dogfish
head
version
the
beer
pours
a
nice
opaque
orange
color
without
a
head
at
all
the
nose
is
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
just
like
a
pie
the
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
with
both
the
pumpkin
and
the
spices
coming
through
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
but
ther
carbonation
is
just
a
bit
too
much
for
me
drinkability
is
also
good
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
with
the
colder
weather
coming
in
good
thing
i
got
6
of
them
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
hazy
medium
orange
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
malty
rich
and
full
of
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
the
taste
has
the
same
full
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
flavors
some
cinnamon
and
cloves
as
well
a
good
overall
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
a
good
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
will
make
a
great
compliment
to
fall
foods
desserts
or
with
fresh
fruit
nice
addition
to
my
fall
lineup
from
this
brewery
now
someone
has
to
come
up
with
a
sweet
potato
porter
fort
wayne
pubcrawl
yes
thanks
silphium
for
bringing
this
bottle
to
our
event
it
poured
a
small
sized
white
head
with
finesmall
sized
bubbles
that
mostly
diminished
the
body
was
cloudy
and
carbonated
with
an
orange
hue
the
nose
in
my
opinion
consisted
of
clove
nutmeg
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
with
a
light
spicy
and
mildly
sweet
flavoring
to
it
this
beer
had
a
bubbly
tingly
smooth
watery
and
thin
texture
to
it
and
it
was
light
bodied
the
lacing
was
very
sparse
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
just
cant
quite
seem
to
get
into
pumpkin
ales
so
far
drinkability
my
first
pumpkin
beer
ever
and
quite
interesting
liquid
pumpkin
pie
not
too
sure
on
this
one
but
it
could
grow
on
me
clear
and
bright
amberorange
color
with
a
small
off

that
doesnt
last

was
really
looking

to
this
but
was
let

a

sweet
and
not
enough
spice
cool
label
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
i
remember
this
used
to
be
my
goto
fall
beer
now
thats
it
been
probably
a
year
since
i
had
it
last
and
ive
gotten
more
serious
about
beer
it
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
i
remember
still
if
you
want
a
fall
beer
with
very
subtle
fall
flavors
this
is
a
good
choice
aroma
has
a
spicy
overtone
mainly
cloves
and
cinnamon
plus
a
hint
of
pumpkin
pours
a
dark
coppery
amber
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
flavor
is
not
strong
but
enjoyable
a
malty
core
plus
pumpkin
and
cloves
and
an
earthy
underpinning
edgy
texture
is
about
average
in
the
fizz
and
body
departments
if
not
memorable
a
good
beer
for
fall
bottle
sampled
slight
whiff
of
nutmeg
on
the
nose
has
a
deep
dark
orange
hue
that
gives
credence
to
the
use
of
real
pumpkin
here
the
spices
take
a
back
seat
bitter
and
sweet
pumpkin
takes
control
of
the
flavor
profile
body
is
a
little
watery
maybe
to
be
expected
at
a
lower
abv
a
great
pumpkin
beer
o
nothing
wrong
here
but
also
nothing
terribly
interesting
a
wellcrafted
pumpkin
beer
that
delivers
decent
spice
and
a
reasonable
taste
of
the
pumpkin
itself
but
not
a
brew
that
immediately
drives
me
to
seek
another
i
had
this
from
a
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
dark
orange
and
smelled
faintly
of
pumpkin
pie
the
pumpkin
flavors
are
there
without
disguising
the
fact
that
it
is
a
beer
a
real
solid
seasonal
and
fine
pumpkin
ale
soapy
head
that
always
has
me
worried
you
definitely
get
the
pumpkin
and
spice
in
the
smell
and
also
in
the
taste
but
it
is
all
kinda
mild
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
you
a
little
off
in
the
carbonation
nothing
special
way
to
many
pumpkins
out
there
to
go
here
overall
this
year
is
a
solid
pass
past
years
seemed
to
be
much
better
full
flavored
well
spiced
pumpkin
ale
amber
in
color
with
on
off
white
head
faint
brussels
lacing
aroma
of
nutmegcinnamon
and
pumpkin
permeate
out
of
the
glass
the
taste
is
a
bit
muted
with
the
spices
not
really
discernable
like
i
found
in
the
aroma
i
think
its
probably
a
bit
too
much
nutmeg
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
slightly
watery
overall
one
of
the
better

pumpkin
beers
out
there
great
flavor
and

drinkable

the
best

brews

my
first
pumpkin

i
most

i
didnt

to
try
a

go

kinda
tastes
like
pumpkin
ginger
ale
nice
beer
had
this
one
on
a
trip
to
atlanta
was
a
very
good
pumpkin
brew
the
spices
are
well
blended
and
the
overal
taste
appealed
to
my
taste
buds
gove
it
and
try
you
wont
be
disappointed
a
fairly
decent
pumpkin
ale
slight
notes
of
pumpkin
and
well
pumpkin
spices
of
course
but
i
liked
that
you
could
still
taste
the
beer
overall
glad
i
tried
it
but
nothing
unexpected
its
got
all
the
right
spices
and
has
a
good
mouthfeel
a
decent
straightahead
pumpkinpie
emulating
affair
here
perhaps
from
that
particular
grandma
whose
spice
measurements
were
always
a
tad
suspect
but
somehow
everything
still
worked
out
fine
in
the
end
enter
the
abv
stage
left
anyways
tasty
and
an
appropriately
oldschool
samhainworthy
offering
allaround
not
bad
had
more
aroma
than
flavor
decent
pumpkin
flavor
up
front
with
some
of
the
pie
spicyness
but
quickly
faded
as
the
beer
went
on
left
just
trace
notes
tastes
like
double
crooked
tree
with
a
hint
of
pumkin
and
spice
t
has
a
quite
spice
laden
texture
from
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
powder
decent
pumpkin
flavor
and
lots
of
flaky
biscuit
malt
not
the
best
pumpkin
but
good
local
o
my
kind
of
pumpkin
beer
the
pumpkin
accents
the
ale
it
doesnt
overpower
it
one
of
the
least
impressive
pumpkin
ales
ive
ever
experienced
not
very
flavorful
only
a
tiny
iota
of
spice
and
pumpkin
flesh
all
in
all
very
hohum
and
meh
im
a
sucker
for
pumpkin
beers
usually
they
are
overspiced
this
one
is
a
pleasant
surprise
malty
moderately
sweet
and
not
overly
spicy
there
is
a
nice
pumpkin
flavor
some
moderate
pie
spice
and
a
good
balance
the
finish
isnt
overly
sweet
its
a
little
hazy
bronzishamber
in
color
and
has
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
the
best
quality
although
the
taste
is
solid
as
well
full
in
body
its
a
great
fall
brew
i
was
unimpressed
by
this
it
seems
incredibly
flavorless
compared
to
the
style
standard
of
the
pumpkin
beer
maybe
folks
like
it
because
its
so
mild
minimal
in
malt
character
and
in
pie
spice
flavor
maybe
its
just
a
touch
of
fall
rather
than
a
full
on
plunge
into
it
but
in
the
context
of
other
pumpkin
beers
this
one
doesnt
taste
like
much
amber
colored
base
beer
should
have
more
sweetness
and
more
body
its
pretty
thin
there
is
a
light
cinnamon
nose
and
taste
to
it
but
the
pumpkin
itself
is
invisible
and
there
isnt
enough
other
additives
in
here
to
fake
it
nice
carbonation
though
and
with
the
lighter
body
i
suspect
this
may
make
a
decent
fall
session
beer
for
some
but
it
lacks
the
spirit
of
the
season
for
me
overall
pretty
standard
pumpkin
feel
nice
flavor
bit
a
little
more
pumpkin
yam
or
squash
could
make
this
beer
a
bit
more
starchy
and
presentable
to
the
consumer
pours
a
great
deep
pumpkin
color
semiclear
head
is
a
couple
inches
and
hangs
out
for
a
long
time
lacing
is
some
of
the
best
i
have
seen
aroma
is
of
spiced
pumpkin
what
i
expected
flavor
is
ok
but
the
spices
are
a
little
much
and
take
away
from
the
true
pumpkin
flavor
spice
also
leaves
a
little
dry
spice
feel
on
the
palate
overall
would
have
been
a
bit
better
with
less
nutmeg
and
spice
and
a
little
more
natural
pumpkin
flavor
tap

pumpkin
beers

this

of
a

pumpkin
ale
not
overpowering
like
some
the
pour
was
dark

with
a
thick
off
white
head
the
smell
was
pumpkin
heavy
but
also
gave
way
to
clove
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
underneath
the
taste
was
similar
although
a
tad
sweeter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
it
was
still
very
delicious
the
mouthfeel
was
heavy
but
worked
with
the
style
i
liked
it
a
lot
overallcomments
an
overall
very
solid
pumpkin
ale
that
while
not
great
is
good
across
the
board
this
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
pumpkin
ales
that
i
have
had
classified
as
a

o
an
easy
to
drink
tasty
amber
ale
better
than
most
pumpkin
beers
for
sure
well
done
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
decent
with
a
raw
pumpkin
character
that
i
typically
look
for
in
pumpkin
ales
but
for
some
reason
it
seemed
weird
here
interesting
to
try
but
would
probably
pass
on
in
the
future
beer
is
mediumlight
to
medium
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
leading
to
a
mouthfeel
that
is
smooth
and
gently
foamy
on
the
palate
overall
rather
enjoyable
and
good
for
the
style
closes
dry
with
light
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
and
lips
overall
a
fairly
well
balanced
beer
i
would
like
a
bit
more
malt
or
body
to
this
but
loads
better
than
the
jackd
up
not
a
ton
of
depth
to
this
beer
but
does
have
a
real
pumpkin
taste
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
complexity
of
its
nose
while
not
all
of
the
components
therein
were
entirely
appropriate
the
general
mix
end
effort
didnt
go
unnoticed
in
comparison
the
taste
was
frankly
dull
and
flat
for
everything
except
its
spiciness
cleanliness
and
decent
freshness
which
showed
nice
raw
ginger
root
and
punch
throughout
this
seems
to
be
a
commercial
type
of
pumpkin
ale
the
spice
is
enough
to
make
sure
anyone
who
was
drinking
it
know
it
was
there
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
just
standard
and
relatively
cheap
so
you
can
buy
and
consume
a
ton
without
getting
overwhelmed
this
is
great
for
someone
looking
for
an
easy
autumnal
to
bring
to
a
party
but
might
be
on
the
bland
side
for
the
seasoned
crafter
ichabod
wouldnt
be
anywhere
near
my
top
choice
for
prototypical
pumpkin
ale
its
nothing
to
lose
your
head
over
ha
its
definitely
not
the
stuff
of
legends
ha
again
i
mean
its
not
exactly
worth
hunting
down
ha
a
third
time
but
in
all
fairness
it
does
make
an
enjoyable
falltime
treat
and
like
most
all
new
holland
offerings
is
worth
grabbing
if
you
see
it
o
a
very
nice
seasonal
beer
could
very
well
knock
back
a
few
of
these
by
a
fire
perfect
for
a
cold
night
looking
forward
to
trying
new
hollands
cabin
fever
in
a
few
months
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
if
this
one
were
available
here
where
i
live
id
have
no
trouble
reaching
for
this
one
every
fall
its
light
enough
to
drink
repeatedly
if
desired
but
packs
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
wanting
more
a
fairly
unique
take
on
the
pumpkin
ale
the
pumpkin
tastes
strong
and
appears
to
be
roasted
as
well
as
a
lesser
role
for
spices
ill
definitely
have
to
pick
up
a
sixpack
next
year
o
at
this
point
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
i
prefer
pumpkin
porter
but
if
you
want
a
great
pumpkin
ale
in
midlate
october
steel
gray
sky
and
watching
college
football
look
no
further
served
in
a
16
oz
pint
glass
at
the
pourhouse
westmont
nj
i
found
too
that
as
the
beer
got
closer
to
room
temperature
i
was
enjoying
it
more
not
to
say
heating
it
would
be
an
option
like
fall
wines
but
if
it
were
a
cold
day
and
i
were
outside
id
grab
an
ichabod
right
off
a
shelf
without
a
care
for
temperature
overall
a
tasty
pumpkin
beer
and
probably
my
favorite
from
new
holland
a
great
new
try
for
the
fall
time
o
another
good
pumpkininfused
beer
if
you
want
balanced
pumpkin
and
beer
flavors
consider
this
one
if
you
want
inyourface
autumn
pie
try
a
brewery
with
less
reputation
to
uphold
overall
quite
possibly
the
most
balanced
of
the
pumpkin
ales
in
terms
of
real
malty
beer
flavor
and
pumpkin
spice
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
despite
full
body
and
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
a
great
pumpkin
ale
overall
another
fantastic
beer
from
new
holland
this
is
not
a
brew
that
i
would
purchase
on
a
regular
basis
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
nutmeg
flavor
that
comes
through
over
the
other
spices
similar
brews
tend
to
have
a
cinnamon
base
to
them
i
also
found
this
to
be
less
sweet
than
the
cinnamonspiced
beers
this
is
not
a
great
beer
buy
it
for
the
nutmeg
amber
colored
with
hints
of
classic
fall
hues
thin
creamcolored
head
sticks
on
the
surface
smells
like
wheat
with
hints
of
spices
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
this
pumpkin
ale
actually
taste
like
beer
as
the
spices
do
not
over
power
it
thats
nice
spices
kind
of
linger
in
the
background
little
pumpkin
flavor
with
a
slight
acidic
finish
that
doesnt
really
detract
from
the
beer
at
all
medium
bodied
mouth
feel
with
a
little
zip
from
the
carbonation
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
with
its
strongest
quality
being
that
the
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
do
not
detract
from
the
beer
flavor
overall
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
possibly
even
the
best
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
pumpkin
ale
the
sweetness
or
spices
are
not
overpowering
or
out
of
balance
with
the
beer
side
of
things
a
solid
sessionable
pumpkin
beer
o
ive
had
better
pumpkins
but
this
is
a
decent
entry
worth
drinking
just
for
the
middle
flavors
had
this
beer
out
of
the
bottle
and
poured
in
into
a
freshly
cleaned
and
wiped
glass
the
appearance
had
an
amber
color
and
a
bit
of
a
haze
to
it
with
about
an
inch
head
from
the
initial
pour
the
smell
was
very
spicy
but
still
had
a
good
amount
of
pumpkin
to
it
the
taste
was
very
unexpected
i
had
thought
that
being
a
pumpkin
ale
this
would
have
more
of
a
pumpkin
taste
to
it
but
this
wasnt
the
case
it
was
a
lot
of
nutmeg
and
a
bit
of
cinnamon
the
mouthfeel
was
not
too
heavy
and
the
beer
lingered
a
bit
but
a
good
amount
in
my
opinion
overall
though
i
would
only
give
it
a
3
with
all
the
great
pumpkin
beers
out
there
this
time
of
year
this
is
one
that
i
would
drink
if
someone
had
it
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
just
not
really
what
i
expected
pours
brilliant
amber
with
a

and

and
noticeable

palate
with

somewhat

although
balanced
against
with

and
pumpkin
notes
attractive

abv

not
noticeable
fresh
attractive
will
repurchase
overall
an
aboveaverage
offering
it
seems
a
bit
unfair
to
compare
this
to
an
imperial
pumpkin
beer
like
schlaflys
or
pumking
but
since
abv
doesnt
factor
into
my
ratings
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
this
one
doesnt
quite
reach
the
upper
echelon
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
i
really
enjoy
the
smell
and
the
taste
actually
pairs
nicely
with
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
brings
it
all
together
they
did
a
good
job
i
feel
like
this
captures
the
essence
of
a
pumpkin
ale
o
solid
for
the
style
worth
a
shot
worth
including
in
a
pumpkin
line
up
for
its
originality

the

overall
a

nice
seasonal

great
for

o
the
look
and
mouthfeel
of
this
one
were
great
i
just
wish
the
flavors
would
have
been
a
little
more
pronounced
overall
more
well
rounded
and
complex
than
others
even
for
the
style
which
is
usually
straight
up
pumpkin
which
comes
across
as
too
sour
d
well
done
overall
with
a
good
balanced
of
spices
and
malt
and
a
finish
that
is
both
dry
enough
to
avoid
becming
cloying
but
also
malty
enough
to
keep
the
spices
from
seeming
harsh
this
also
has
the
odd
distinction
of
being
perhaps
the
only
pumpkin
beer
that
have
had
that
smelled
like
raw
pumpkin
which
isnt
as
unpleasant
as
it
sounds
o
overall
an
excellent
brew
love
the
brewers
at
nh
they
do
awesome
with
ease
overall
this
is
disappointing
i
usually
like
new

but
this
one
was
not
for
me

enjoyed

quite
a

overall
drinkability
on
some
levels
this
beer
works
well
and
on
others
it
does
not
too
much
in
the
way
of
spicing
yes
the
pumpkin
comes
out
a
bit
but
the
spices
are
so
strong
it
comes
out
being
more
of
a
winter
warmer
in
the
end
tasty
but
not
terribly
beery

seems
to

midpalate
finishes
lightly
spicy
sweet
but
semidry
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
available
in
the
midwest
and
very
much
a
beer
not
overly
spiced
and
sweet
and
there
is
enough
here
to
please
both
those
who
usually
are
fans
of
pumpkin
ales
and
those
who
are
not
o
this
beer
is
ok
but
unfortunately
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
are
a
little
out
of
balance
way
too
much
cinnamon
for
the
amounts
of
nutmeg
and
allspice
o
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
better
certainly
but
worse
as
well
i
just
wish
the
flavors
were
balanced
a
bit
better
and
a
little
more
pronounced
o
like
some
ipas
can
be
considered
as
a
hop
bomb
this
beer
seems
like
its
a
cinnamon
bomb
and
could
use
a
better
balance
between
the
flavors
of
pumpkins
and
spices
o
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
it
deserves
way
better
than
its
rating
thats
for
sure
a
good
drinkability
as
well
as
a
nice
flavor
profile
most
pumpkin
beers
are
either
too
light
on
flavor
or
too
large
in
alcohol
this
baby
is
just
right
overall
this
a
very
well
balanced
and
aromatic
brew
that
embodies
the
season
and
is
easy
to
drink
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
but
this
is
surely
one
i
would
enjoy
having
again
o
good
pumpkin
was
not
overpowering
and
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
this
is
a
bit
thin
bodied
but
easy
drinking
and
well
blended
beer
which
really
makes
me
like
it
for
a
pumpkin
beer
o
new
hollands
ichabod
pumpkin
ale
does
a
great
job
of
whisking
the
drinker
away
to
a
mental
fall
fantasy
world
similar
to
the
likes
of
sleepy
hollow
but
here
in
the
real
world
the
beers
malt
backbone
falls
just
slightly
short
of
real
involvement
and
balance
the
spiciness
throughout
is
great
but
its
in
need
of
a
little
more
balance
and
body
for
the
cool
fall
days
in
the
end
its
one
of
my
favorite
fall
seasonals
i
wish
i
could
just
slightly
tweak
o
enjoyable
well
worth
checking
out
but
not
something
to
brag
about
per
se
overall
it
was
about
average
to
a
little
better
than
average
for
a
pumpkin
ale
o
i
love
how
this
smells
and
it
really
shows
a
lot
of
promise
when
i
hold
it
to
my
nose
but
it
disappoints
from
there
the
clove
bitterness
is
a
turnoff
the
taste
just
doesnt
live
up
to
the
aroma
if
you
are
looking
for
a
pumpkin
ale
that
drinks
like
a
regular
pale
ale
then
this
is
for
u
but
if
u
prefer
bigger
pumpkin
flavor
i
would
try
something
else
a
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
right
here
ichabod
gets
it
right
if
you
want
a
sessionable
pumpkin
beer
youve
got
it
this
is
a
great
pumkin
ale
of
of
the
best
ive
had
overall
more
pumpkin
less
spice
if
you
please
hell
ill
just
take
less
spice
one
step
at
a
time
you
know
poured
a
stiff
thick
single
finger
head
with
a
nice
orange
coloring
this
ale
had
almost
no
scent
and
even
asked
others
to
help
me
but
no
one
could
the
taste
is
rather
interesting
as
you
can
detect
the
nutmeg
and
spice
but
it
had
a
real
earthy
taste
almost
gourdish
this
makes
sense
as
it
is
supposed
to
be
brewed
with
actual
pumpkin
i
enjoyed
this
rather
unique
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
another
october
rolls
around
and
another
opportunity
to
try
out
a
new
pumpkin
ale
first
time
trying
new
holland
ichabod
ale
and
was
impressed
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
inch
offwhite
head
that
is
pretty
much
gone
after
a
few
minutes
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
really
something
pumpkin
spice
sweet
cinnamon
nutmeg
all
contained
wrapped
around
a
subtle
smokiness
considering
the
strength
of
the
smell
the
taste
is
very
balanced
very
easy
to
drink
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
spice
are
probably
the
most
notable
features
but
theres
also
a
subtle
mint
taste
towards
the
end
a
complex
brew
smells
of
fresh
pumpkin
puree
with
a
side
of
cinnamonnutmegmint
spicing
and
a
touch
of
butternut
squash
aroma
very
savory
nose
there
is
hardly
any
sweet
malt
aroma
at
all
flavor
starts
out
as
a
dusty
cinnamon
spice
that
transforms
into
a
good
solid
toasted
bread
malt
and
savory
pumpkin
flesh
combo
that
works
well
without
overpowering
my
palate
on
spicing
like
many
pumpkin
ales
tend
to
do
this
one
is
worth
trying
out
for
a
drier
approach
to
the
pumpkin
ale
concept
overall
not
too
bad
not
overly
sweet
and
it
had
a
decent
flavor
and
feel
profile
worth
a
try
i
sampled
this
beer
along
with
another
similar
choice
blue
moon
harvest
moon
and
i
quite
enjoyed
it
the
smell
and
taste
of
pumpkin
was
evident
and
had
a
very
nice
sweetness
to
it
it
beat
my
expectations
the
presentation
of
the
label
was
great
as
well
go
buffs
i
think
theres
just
a
little
too
much
spiceespecially
cinnamonwhich
held
this
pumpkin
ale
back
from
being
what
it
could
be
still
its
nice
overall
this
beer
was
quite
a
nice
selection
especially
for
a
first
time
it
really
had
all
three
elements
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
all
in
a
fair
balance
the
malted
roasted
was
also
a
nice
decision
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
while
sitting
in
my
living
room
windows
down
slight
chilly
breeze
in
the
air
and
the
smell
of
a
bonfire
coming
in
from
the
outside
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
look
for
on
a
night
like
this
the
one
thing
that
can
best
describe
this
beer
is
wellbalanced
i
will
be
looking
for
this
beer
again
hopefully
before
the
fall
season
is
over
cheers
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
pumpkin
ale
it
looks
and
smells
great
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
too
onedimensional
and
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
for
my
taste
in
a
hearty
fall
pumpkin
beer
still
this
is
a
tasty
and
very
drinkable
beer
good
beer
and
clever
name
new
holland
o
not
impressed
by
this
one
definitely
on
my
long
list
of
dont
bother
pumpkin
ales
note
pumpkin
ales
are
not
for
me
so
it
is
a
bit
negatively
biased
review
but
still
scores
well
due
to
spices
o
a
notch
above
all
of
the
other
pumpkin
beer
6
packs
that
ive
tried
this
beer
is
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
tastes
of
pumpkin
pie
but
not
quite
as
strong
as
southern
tiers
pumking
this
would
go
well
with
any
of
the
fall
holidays
or
just
as
a
good
beer
to
get
away
from
what
youre
used
to
overall
i
was
let
down
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
below
average
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
was
going
in
the
right
direction
but
when
it
got
to
the
flavor
it
went
down
hill
fast
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
went
down
fairly
smooth
but
theres
no
way
that
the
flavors
could
hold
my
attention
one
is
more
then
enough
for
me
now
way
i
would
want
another
one
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
full
of
nice
pumpkin
pie
aromas
and
was
pretty
true
to
style
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
was
pretty
bland
and
thin
without
those
nice
pumpkin
pie
aspects
that
i
got
in
the
aroma
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
it
just
isnt
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
pumpkin
ale
all
in
all
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
when
it
came
to
the
taste
it
just
didnt
deliver
ill
have
to
pass
on
this
beer
i
was
looking
for
a
new
favorite
pumpkin
ale
but
it
sure
isnt
going
to
be
this
one
better
luck
next
time
new
holland
o
meh
overall
when
i
buy
a
pumpkin
beer
im
really
not
looking
for
a
whole
lot
more
than
some
entertainment
this
beer
was
decent
and
it
satisfied
my
craving
on
the
first
chilly
night
of
september
but
there
arent
any
aspects
of
this
beer
that
could
be
considered
exceptional
this
beer
has
a
nice
amber
colored
body
with
a
nice
small
tanish
head
to
it
that
holds
its
own
for
a
while
the
smell
has
nice
pumpkin
aroma
alomost
pie
like
the
taste
is
awesome
it
has
a
nice
roasted
pumpkin
flavor
with
the
clove
and
some
peppery
notes
espcially
once
it
warms
up
a
little
bit
that
is
when
the
flavor
come
alive
the
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
smooth
and
leaves
a
nice
peppery
after
taste
in
your
mouth
overall
this
is
a
really
good
pumpkin
beer
not
the
best
i
have
had
but
i
would
say
it
is
now
in
my
top
ten
o
merely
a
mediocre
pumpkin
ale
for
me
a
bit
disappointing
considering
my
general
liking
of
this
style
and
brewery
o
overall
this
is
still
a
great
pumpkin
ale
and
probably
in
my
top
3
or
4
its
also
a
lot
more
sessionable
than
some
of
the
heavy
hitters
like
weyerbacher
pumking
and
punkin
that
are
closer
to
the
89
mark
overall
i
would
say
this
is
quite
an
underrated
pumpkin
ale
it
does
exactly
what
beer
drinkers
ask
a
pumpkin
ale
to
do
no
more
and
no
less
granted
it
does
taste
a
bit
better
ontap
than
from
the
bottle
so
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
try
this
on
draft
go
for
it
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
nh
but
i
have
to
say
they
pull
this
off
well
nice
stab
by
new
holland
still
pushed
around
by
the
spice
rack
yet
better
than
the
average
probably
because
it
doesnt
fault
in
some
of
the
other
ways
pumpkin
beers
falter
too
sweet
no
pumpkin
etc
o
very
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
something
you
could
drink
more
than
one
of
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
pleasant
pleasing
flavor
more
of
the
same
spices
are
present
along
with
the
pumpkin
flavoring
maybe
this
is
just
because
its
off
season
and
i
dont
have
a
recent
point
of
reference
but
im
digging
this
brew
an
extremely
tasty
pumpkin
ale
best
thing
about
this
beer
it
tastes
like
a
beer
and
one
i
would
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
that
is
saying
a
lot
for
pumpkin
ale
imo
doverall
this
was
a
good
pumpkin
ale
on
flavor
nothing
really
unique
but
you
got
the
spices
and
pumpkin
flavors
that
should
be
in
a
pumpkin
ale
it
did
lack
on
smell
and
mouthfeel
but
besides
that
its
one
of
the
more
decent
pumpkin
ales
i
prob
wouldnt
get
a
6
pack
of
this
but
im
sure
to
grab
at
least
a
12oz
of
this
every
october
this
is
something
i
would
expect
from
a
macro
brewery
little
flavor
no
smell
and
nothing
to
look
at
very
disappointed
this
came
from
new
holland
im
usually
a
fan
of
their
beers
p
nice
pairings
with
stuffing
and
sandwiches
o
good
pumpkin
beer
it
takes
a
lot
to
differentiate
between
the
pumpkin
beers
because
they
are
all
so
similar
this
one
doesnt
stand
out
a
whole
lot
but
its
good
o
a
very
mild
pumpkin
ale
lacking
in
some
of
the
other
pumpkin
spices
mainly
cinnamon
in
this
one
o
ive
had
better
pumpkin
brews
i
just
prefer
more
pumpkin
flavor
and
more
sweetness
the
bitterness
in
here
just
hides
a
lot
of
flavor
overall
this
brew
has
so
much
bitter
spice
flavor
that
it
just
overwhelms
all
the
other
flavors
in
this
beer
thanks
to
travisnd
for
sending
this
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
copper
color
wih
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
pumpkin
some
spices
taste
is
pumpkin
nutmeg
cinnamon
well
balanced
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
dark
orange
in
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
forms
and
recedes
to
minimal
covering
lots
of
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
in
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
aroma
a
bit
spicy
at
first
with
notes
of
cinnamon
and
clove
pumpkin
is
light
and
blends
in
with
the
spiciness
nicely
moderate
hop
presence
with
some
floral
notes
that
come
through
midpalate
finish
has
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
another
hint
of
cinnamonclove
spiciness
malt
presence
is
moderate
and
slightly
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
and
brown
sugar
nice
moderate
body
to
this
one
with
average
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
to
it
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
this
year
really
enjoyed
it
na
zdravje
overall
a
good
beer
that
goes
beyond
the
novelty
of
pumpkin
beer
producing
a
balanced
brew
overall
lets
be
honest
i
dont
usually
like
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
i
find
outright
offensive
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
color
with
a
very
slight
head
scent
is
quite
weak
with
mostly
sweet
malts
and
a
slight
pumpkin
spice
hint
taste
is
rather
weak
in
pumpkin
flavors
im
mostly
getting
malts
and
some
spices
for
the
taste
the
texture
is
rather
smooth
and
full
however
making
for
great
drinking
i
think
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
actually
thing
this
was
an
oktoberfest
beer
and
not
a
pumpkin
ale
kind
of
disapointing
as
i
was
expecting
more
had
a
pint
of
this
on
tap
at
monarch
in
grand
rapids
overall
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
nicely
balanced
spices
dont
overwhelm
the
pumpkin
the
only
thing
i
would
have
changed
about
this
beer
is
a
thicker
mouthfeel
but
it
is
only
5
2
percent
and
have
it
a
bit
sweeter
to
balance
the
hops
out
more
other
than
that
its
an
interesting
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
and
definitely
a
tasty
beer
started
off
unremarkable
but
decent
gets
a
little
gross
dont
know
if
i
got
a
crappy
bottle
or
what
but
this
was
not
doing
it
for
me
overall
i
guess
im
impressed
having
a
limited
amount
of
pumpkin
ales
to
compare
it
to
i
would
also
guess
it
would
pair
well
with
indian
cuisine
or
some
asain
fare
recommended
overall
a
tasty
well
balanced
pumpkin
beer
very
drinkable
good
spice
level
o
while
this
beer
looks
great
it
is
very
much
a
letdown
in
the
flavor
department
not
enjoyable
at
all
and
went
down
the
drain
before
i
was
halfway
through
the
bottle
o
nothing
bad
but
ive
been
drinking
lots
of
pumpkin
ales
this
month
and
this
one
doesnt
really
stand
out
o
not
impressed
with
this
pumpkin
ale
not
terrible
but
not
great
overall
weird
not
quite
my
style
despite
that
i
love
sours
this
just
doesnt
fit
like
it
should
not
sure
if
its
supposed
to
be
like
that
or
its
infected
but
doesnt
bide
too
well
its
a
fine
inoffensive
tasting
beer
that
suggests
the
taste
and
pumpkin
somewhat
its
not
earth
shaking
or
spiritual
in
any
regard
but
id
much
rather
be
drinking
this
than
a
macrobrew
drinkable
but
not
one
id
turn
to
regularly
pours
a
nice
deep
pecanbrown
clearish
with
a
white
ring
that
washes
the
glass
smell
is
of
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
some
decent
pumpkin
flavor
comes
through
but
is
muted
by
a
hot
and
acrid
taste
on
the
back
end
finishes
a
little
sour
feel
is
a
bit
thin
ok
but
the
aftertaste
keeps
this
from
being
exciting
tried
the
ichabod
ale
yesterday
at
our
local
tap
house
bar
grill
the
beer
came
in
a
pint
glass
the
color
was
a
rich
clear
amber
with
decent
white
foam
that
laced
at
the
top
not
so
much
at
the
bottom
im
suffering
from
allergies
currently
so
my
smell
might
be
a
little
off
but
i
smelled
more
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
than
i
did
pumpkin
the
taste
started
like
a
typical
red
ale
then
the
cinnamon
really
took
over
the
pallat
was
left
clean
but
then
the
pumpkin
start
to
come
out
as
the
beer
warmed
the
flavor
because
more
robust
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
docked
slightly
due
to
the
spicey
cinnamon
flavor
made
it
so
one
is
probably
enough
good
job
holland
overall
dissapointed
in
the
end
with
the
flavour
the
nose
was
promising
but
it
lacks
body
and
taste
too
high
of
an
abv
for
such
a
lack
of
body
as
well
ichabod
ale
pours
a
darker
amber
color
with
a
small
but
lacing
head
there
is
a
strong
pumpkin
smell
very
autumish
the
taste
has
a
nice
creamy
pumkin
taste
with
hints
of
some
other
spices
i
found
it
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
overall
i
found
this
a
pretty
good
pumkin
ale
not
the
best
but
very
enjoyable
o
have
had
much
better
pumpkin
ales
not
a
horrible
version
a
great
beer
at
the
beginning
with
a
poor
ending
o
nice
looking
pumpkin
ale
tastes
and
smells
like
what
you
would
expect
though
nothing
extraordinary
cant
really
compare
this
to
the
tommyknocker
since
that
is
brewed
with
molasses
o
not
very
good
they
missed
the
boat
on
this
beer
as
there
is
just
too
much
spice
not
enough
pumpkin
and
an
overall
mess
quite
lame
if
you
ask
me
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
and
spices
not
a
huge
pumpkin
taste
compared
to
other
pumpkin
beers
d
is
a
refreshing
beer
not
lots
of
extreme
flavors
little
to
zero
hops
encountered
overall
i
like
this
pumpkin
ale
the
best
of
what
i
have
tried
so
far
this
season
it
doesnt
have
the
creamed
corn
funk
that
i
noticed
with
the
pumking
and
punkin
ale
if
i
were
to
choose
between
the
three
again
next
fall
ill
go
with
ichabod
i
know
im
probably
in
the
minority
with
this
one
overall
this
pumpkin
beer
is
lost
among
the
rest
its
certainly
drinkable
but
nothing
to
really
seek
out
the
initial
taste
on
it
is
good
but
it
just
dies
after
that
i
think
new
holland
can
do
better
id
say
its
good
but
doesnt
quite
come
up
to
pumking
o
im
a
lover
of
pumpkin
beer
im
also
a
fan
of
new
holland
however
nh
ichabod
pumpkin
ale
not
so
much
this
beer
was
a
let
down
i
give
a
schlitz
for
ichabod
regardless
of
its
minimal
faults
it
still
feels
like
fall
thats
good
enough
overall
impression
while
im
on
this
hunt
for
the
best
pumpkin
ale
my
cousin
mark
mentioned
this
one
while
we
were
sampling
i
picked
one
up
and
this
will
be
my
last
time
from
new
holland
very
weak
and
almost
didnt
resemble
a
pumpkin
ale
at
all
not
going
to
be
a
negative
person
on
this
brew
but
wouldnt
recommend
schlafly
is
still
the
best
soso
the
bitterness
is
unwelcome
from
what
i
expect
out
of
a
pumpkin
beer
otherwise
just
a
bit
bland
and
boring
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
what
i
would
look
for
if
i
wanted
a
pumpkin
ale
overall
it
was
okay
i
thought
the
smell
was
going
to
give
it
a
much
more
pumpkin
taste
but
it
was
really
more
of
a
spice
bomb
than
anything
else
when
i
first
smelled
and
tasted
this
beer
i
though
dang
o
its
a
light
pumpkin
ale
but
tasty
medium
bodied
with
a
real
smooth
feel
to
it
but
lacking
a
bit
on
the
finish
a
good
beer
overall
but
the
pumpkin
flavors
never
really
do
too
much
for
me
in
the
end
overall
unfortunately
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
i
look
more
for
allspice
cinnamon
and
vanilla
to
be
highlighted
in
a
pumpkin
ale
ichabod
is
probably
fairly
polarizing
though
some
might
really
enjoy
the
way
that
new
holland
has
tweaked
their
ingredient
list
but
in
my
opinion
what
they
wound
up
w
has
nothing
on
the
classic
pumpkin
piepumpkin
ale
aromaflavor
not
a
drainpour
but
also
not
one
id
try
to
get
my
hands
on
again
overall
not
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
overall
it
is
just
ok
spice
is
subtle
but
also
forgettable
pours
seethrough
reddish
amber
with
bubbly
white
head
smells
of
cinnamon
pie
with
crust
tastes
of
pumpkin
pie
crust
cinnamon
and
some
hops
towards
the
finish
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
that
zaps
the
tongue
a
pumpkin
thats
a
session
with
dessert
flavors
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
o
ichabod
is
a
true
pumpkin
ale
with
an
ample
dose
of
pumpkin
flavor
and
wellbalanced
spicing
and
hopping
that
allow
the
pumpkin
and
malt
backbone
to
shine
thru
it
this
respect
it
is
an
exceptional
fall
seasonal
can
serve
as
an
excellent
standard
for
the
style
pours
a
brownish
copper
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
didnt
stick
around
too
long
smell
is
reminiscent
of
pumpkin
with
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
also
some
sweet
malt
notes
thrown
in
the
taste
starts
with
with
the
malt
and
subtle
sweet
notes
not
as
sweet
as
other
beers
of
this
style
the
flavors
then
quickly
shift
to
the
cinnamon
and
others
very
spicy
finish
but
not
overwhelming
great
pumpkin
flavors
weaved
in
this
one
had
nice
carbonation
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
it
was
smooth
and
enjoyable
and
didnt
overwhelm
the
palette
could
have
multiple
beers
and
not
be
put
off
by
the
spices
an
enjoyable
pumpkin
beer
worth
checking
out
o
a
weak
offering
that
i
had
high
hopes
for
i
wont
be
switching
away
from
punkin
just
yet
alright
some
more
autumn
seasonals
working
their
way
into
the
bliss
tastings
this
one
pours
a
clear
dark
tawn
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
nutmeg
cinnamon
brown
sugar
rye
bread
toffee
and
a
touch
of
butterscotch
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
breadiness
kicks
into
higher
gear
here
the
spices
are
slightly
muted
blending
into
the
bread
creating
a
sort
of
banana
bread
quality
there
may
or
may
not
be
a
hint
of
toasted
pumpkin
seeds
in
there
as
well
i
cant
tell
for
sure
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
creamy
slightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
generally
enjoyable
pumpkin
beer
nothing
is
done
to
any
great
degree
but
that
probably
helps
keeps
things
from
going
too
far
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
out
of
the
ones
i
have
had
i
like
pumpkin
beers
but
usually
after
one
that
is
enough
for
me
this
is
much
more
drinkable
than
many
of
the
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
this
one
strikes
a
great
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
spice
i
had
this
on
tap
several
times
last
fall
and
thought
it
was
great
still
holds
up
overall
could
have
definitely
been
more
bold
nice
mild
flavor
so
they
go
down
pretty
quick
pretty
forgettable
not
much
there
to
savor
o
pouring
this
was
promising
smell
was
inviting
taste
isnt
bad
just
very
light
mouthfeel
is
very
lacking
i
still
havent
had
dogfishs
punkin
or
southern
teirs
pumpking
have
high
hopes
for
these
as
all
other
pumpkin
ales
have
let
me
down
the
beer
is
orange
and
slightly
hazy
with
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
that
leaves
random
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
brings
pumpkins
sweet
malt
and
autumn
spices
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
somewhat
artificial
with
an
abundance
of
spices
the
body
is
thin
with
malt
presence
overshadowed
by
spice
overall
its
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
worth
a
try
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
pretty
nice
looking
orange
brown
color
its
got
a
good
amount
of
clarity
to
it
also
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
spicy
its
nothing
overwhelming
by
any
means
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
the
pumpkin
flavors
up
front
with
a
light
sweetness
of
brown
sugar
the
aftertaste
of
the
beer
has
a
pretty
nice
autumn
spice
to
it
with
a
light
warming
feeling
the
mouthfeel
is
drinkable
enough
to
have
a
few
in
one
sitting
overall
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
at
all
d
this
is
quaffable
to
the
point
of
getting
sick
of
it
but
it
doesnt
mean
that
id
do
it
nothing
completely
offensive
but
nothing
that
will
make
me
have
another
either
o
its
not
that
it
was
a
terrible
beer
where
i
wouldnt
drink
it
if
it
someone
picked
it
up
but
it
really
wasnt
a
pumpkin
ale
imo
i
had
to
almost
imagine
any
traces
of
pumpkin
or
spices
in
it
to
convince
myself
that
it
was
a
pumpkin
ale
at
all
o
nothing
memorable
smells
better
than
it
tastes
and
thats
not
saying
a
lot
more
hops
flavor
than
pumpkin
and
spices
unfortunately
bottle
design
is
a
decent
twist
on
the
headless
horseman
overall
a
standard
weaker
easy
drinker
this
toned
down
version
may
actaully
be
good
for
a
occasional
seasonal
drinker
looking
to
get
some
pumpkin
flavor
its
simply
too
watered
down
for
anyone
else
that
has
had
this
style
before
o
one
and
done
onice
attempt
not
really
the
malt
backbone
to
make
the
taste
more
prominent
mouth
feel
and
overall
lightbodied
and
far
too
sweet
in
my
opinion
not
enough
spice
or
pumpkin
taste
fizzy
on
the
roof
of
your
mouth
a
bit
skunk
overall
not
my
top
pumpkin
ale
by
a
long
shot
if
you
havent
had
it
try
it
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
im
really
not
sure
how
they
can
call
this
one
a
pumpkin
beer
aggressive
pour
leads
to
nearly
no
head
smell
had
quite
a
bit
of
cinnamon
which
was
pretty
much
the
only
taste
that
stuck
out
to
me
nearly
no
pumpkin
taste
which
was
disappointing
given
its
a
pumpkin
beer
pours
out
an
amber
body
with
a
thin
whitehead
that
disappears
quickly
the
retention
and
lacing
on
here
are
okay
but
not
great
has
decent
carbonation
the
smell
is
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
hops
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
pumpkin
but
than
the
spices
kick
in
and
get
a
strong
cinnamon
flavor
followed
by
some
floral
and
pine
hops
the
aftertaste
is
a
mix
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
pine
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
semidry
and
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
but
if
you
want
a
pumpkin
ale
with
a
better
pumpkin
flavor
id
suggest
trying
ofallen
pumpkin
beer
conclusion
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
looking
to
try
their
hand
at
a
good
pumkin
beer
on
the
other
hand
i
would
probably
recommend
this
to
someone
who
isnt
very
fond
of
pumkin
but
might
want
to
give
the
style
a
try
still
who
the
hell
wants
to
drink
a
pumpkin
ale
without
much
pumkin
cheers
pours
a
nice
amber
w
a
fairly
weak
sliver
of
a
head
head
quickly
disappears
to
almost
nothing
very
clear
looking
beer
you
can
see
right
through
it
very
little
carbonation
or
lacing
nose
is
that
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
pumpkin
malt
hops
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
out
in
front
i
wish
more
pumpkin
was
there
taste
is
slightly
different
with
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
coming
to
the
front
while
everything
else
takes
a
step
back
feel
is
fairly
malty
w
a
slight
hop
bite
in
the
background
this
is
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
but
its
a
decent
one
to
pick
up
if
you
havent
tried
it
cheers
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
fair
representation
of
a
pumpkin
ale
i
had
heard
really
good
things
about
it
and
had
this
beer
recommended
to
me
by
coworkers
and
colleagues
but
im
not
particularly
impressed
i
have
however
a
fan
of
other
new
holland
brews
like
the
dragons
milk
worth
trying
if
youre
a
pumpkin
beer
fan
if
you
arent
its
hit
or
miss
poured
out
the
lightest
of
the
three
with
a
hazy
orange
tinted
amber
color
and
a
nice
soft
off
white
head
that
reached
a
height
of
around
an
inch
or
so
before
it
settled
down
with
some
nice
lacing
on
the
side
that
really
just
surprised
me
with
how
well
it
hung
in
there
to
be
honest
really
quite
the
solid
look
nice
aroma
of
pumpkin
spice
hints
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
all
the
usual
characters
here
with
a
touch
of
a
west
coast
hop
flair
to
it
especially
as
it
warms
crisp
and
super
clean
flavor
here
starts
with
a
touch
of
a
light
malt
note
and
then
swoops
in
with
a
big
hit
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
which
dries
out
the
palate
very
nicely
very
even
consistency
i
have
to
admit
as
it
comes
together
very
nice
light
drying
of
palate
leaves
a
touch
of
light
spice
and
the
lightest
hint
of
hops
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
super
drinkable
in
fact
out
of
the
whole
night
i
enjoyed
this
one
the
most
out
of
all
of
them
not
bad
but
the
spices
seem
to
hurt
drinkability
in
this
case
nothing
i
would
want
more
of
di
could
see
myself
having
a
couple
but
not
if
a
better
pumpkin
ale
were
about
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
drink
it
again
d
very
drinkable
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
such
a
thing
clean
finish
contributes
to
drinkability
overall
this
is
my
fall
brew
of
choice
and
i
pickup
multiple
cases
of
this
when
it
comes
out
on
the
shelves
a
fall
seasonal
as
great
as
the
artwork
that
graces
its
box
drinkability
im
still
on
a
quest
to
try
all
sorts
of
different
pumpkin
beers
im
not
sure
this
one
will
end
up
in
my
crate
next
year
but
im
sure
itll
be
had
again
from
fall
brew
ranking
notes
2010
pour
produced
a
yellowamber
body
with
a
quick
diminishing
head
the
aroma
is
funky
reminiscent
of
cooked
squash
the
palate
is
on
the
flat
side
with
light
carbonation
medium
bodied
the
overall
flavor
really
isnt
all
that
good
slightly
metallic
with
spice
that
lingers
and
warms
for
a
bit
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
but
not
the
worst
either
dwow
this
has
to
be
the
first
pumpkin
beer
that
ive
had
that
the
spice
doesnt
completely
overwhelm
the
rest
of
the
beer
this
is
by
far
the
easiest
drinking
pumpkin
beer
yet
d
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
goes
down
easy
and
i
think
its
a
good
fall
beer
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
have
with
a
big
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
i
should
mention
i
am
not
a
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
ichabod
was
purchased
as
part
of
a
new
holland
variety
pack
so
i
thought
i
would
giveitago
ichabod
is
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
i
just
wish
the
flavor
was
richer
i
would
recommend
this
to
just
about
anyone
it
tastes
more
like
cinnamon
cinnamon
water
it
was
not
a
ver
good
beer
very
watery
new
holland
failed
me
here
good
beer
overall
solid
offering
just
not
something
for
me
if
i
could
change
it
i
would
add
a
bit
more
pumpkin
flavor
very
drinkable
d
well
the
season
is
over
and
i
will
have
to
seek
more
out
next
year
pretty
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
sampled
during
the
winter
2010
tasting
brought
by
timmy
this
was
the
first
time
ive
been
disappointed
by
new
holland
brewing
co
they
are
one
of
my
top
5
favorite
american
breweries
and
have
never
let
me
down
until
now
the
beer
wasnt
bad
there
just
wasnt
enough
pumpkin
spice
character
and
new
holland
rarely
lacks
character
one
was
enough
for
me
my
very
first
pumpkin
ale
received
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
pours
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
little
head
light
lacing
smells
just
like
a
pumpkin
and
tastes
a
little
like
a
pumpkin
with
that
familiar
beer
taste
afterwards
like
i
said
this
was
my
first
pumpkin
beer
so
i
cant
really
compare
to
others
pours
a
hazy
copperbrown
color
one
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
pumpkin
spice
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
pumpkin
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
hops
pumpkin
spice
and
slight
pale
malt
overall
good
blend
appearance
and
aroma
more
strongly
a
spiced
beer
than
a
pumpkin
but
still
good
overall
awesome
a
halloween
tradition
pumpkin
beer
while
giving
out
trickortreat
candy
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
prominent
allspice
from
start
to
finish
but
the
pumpkin
was
pretty
much
mia
fairly
thin
body
and
a
little
watery
at
the
finish
lacks
festivity
pours
a
perfect
amber
orange
color
with
a
foamy
and
lacy
head
that
recedes
slowly
has
a
gram
cracker
aroma
like
the
crust
but
not
overly
sweet
perfect
balanced
pumpkin
and
malt
backbone
with
a
tinge
of
astringent
bitterness
on
the
finish
flvors
of
pumpkin
pie
yams
and
some
orange
peel
great
fall
brew
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
like
cinnamon
powder
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
it
really
is
underrated
and
has
that
true
pumpkin
pie
taste
to
it
pours
an
orangish
brown
with
a
light
head
nose
brings
a
good
dose
of
slicing
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
clove
mild
pumpkin
the
taste
and
feel
are
really
both
quite
tainted
by
an
excessive
amount
of
spicing
in
comparison
to
anything
else
that
is
going
on
in
the
end
this
was
just
taken
too
far
in
one
direction
and
there
is
no
balance
to
this
beer
d
not
very
tasty
does
not
go
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
there
are
several
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
over
this
one
the
body
is
right
where
i
would
like
in
a
pumpkin
beer
medium
full
bodied
the
added
pumpkin
may
be
adding
some
addition
body
or
starchiness
which
i
like
and
it
finishes
pretty
smooth
as
well
drinkability
is
above
average
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
d
if
the
flavor
didnt
have
that
awful
middle
transition
i
would
probably
drink
this
again
this
has
such
stand
out
characteristics
but
some
really
distracting
ones
if
i
could
combine
this
with
other
runofthemill
pumpkin
beers
i
might
just
have
the
best
one
possible
pumpkins
arent
my
favorite
and
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
have
one
and
move
on
d
i
had
high
hopes
and
expected
more
from
this
beer
the
watery
weak
flavor
and
lack
of
flavor
really
kills
it
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
however
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
one
if
it
was
offered
to
me
you
can
do
a
lot
better
than
this
if
youre
looking
for
a
pumpkin
ale
drinkability
fairly
poor
almost
no
carbonation
and
weak
flavor
makes
it
seem
more
like
a
watery
juice
drink
than
a
beer
glad
i
only
got
one
in
a
mix
six
pumpkin
beers
may
not
be
my
thing
i
will
definitely
try
a
different
kind
in
the
future
maybe
not
this
fall
though
d
i
will
not
have
this
again
unsavory
spices
and
fake
pumpkin
not
a
good
combination
d
overall
ichabod
is
a
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
but
ive
had
many
that
were
better
i
will
not
be
purchasing
this
one
again
alternatives
i
enjoyed
southern
tier
pumking
much
more
that
being
said
it
was
much
better
than
the
other
pumpkin
beer
i
had
this
season
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
a
little
flat
and
lighter
than
expected
really
not
a
drinkable
beer
i
would
not
seek
this
out
very
enjoyable
seasonal
beer
very
drinkable
with
medium
body
mouthfeel
d
ichabod
is
quite
an
unusual
pumpkin
ale
the
appearance
was
pleasant
and
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
but
certain
elements
of
the
aroma
and
flavor
kind
of
rubbed
me
the
wrong
way
i
feel
it
is
a
bit
too
bitter
for
the
style
and
the
spices
outweigh
the
roasted
pumpkin
meat
and
vanilla
attributes
really
a
nice
example
of
the
style
not
the
biggest
in
terms
of
pumpkin
or
pumpkin
pie
flavor
but
nice
none
the
less
with
so
many
other
great
pumpkin
beers
out
there
this
will
probably
not
be
one
that
i
seek
out
not
one
that
i
would
turn
down
if
offered
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
either
it
was
a
clear
day
for
brewing
and
this
beer
was
acceptable
i
feel
like
i
frequently
dont
give
new
holland
enough
credit
but
this
beer
is
second
to
dogfish
head
and
a
few
others
in
the
world
of
pumpkin
beers
i
liked
that
the
aromas
and
flavors
werent
overwhelmed
by
the
spices
but
i
could
have
used
more
maltiness
and
more
well
everything
properly
carbonated
properly
colored
just
not
extraordinary
my
first
pumpkin
ale
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
this
beer
mostly
tastes
like
an
amber
ale
with
a
very
small
amount
of
pumpkin
and
no
spice
smell
is
mostly
malty
amber
lager
with
a
bit
of
pumpkin
appearance
is
that
of
weak
tea
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
are
okay
but
nothing
special
carbonation
is
very
light
again
this
is
my
first
pumpkin
ale
but
this
isnt
what
i
was
expecting
hopefully
the
dogfish
one
will
be
better
ill
let
you
know
dim
pissed
i
spent
13
on
a
6
pack
of
this
stuff
not
good
at
all
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
is
still
the
pumpkin
beer
to
beat
imo
the
mouthfeel
is
above
average
but
nothing
to
write
about
unless
youre
me
and
you
feel
you
have
to
write
about
all
aspects
of
every
beer
you
drink
well
im
like
me
so
here
goes
medium
body
with
creamy
carbonation
and
an
abrupt
finish
with
lingering
mild
bitterness
and
spices
i
like
this
beer
its
a
good
seasonal
but
elysians
night
owl
runs
circles
around
it
for
a
more
available
alternative
in
the
midwest
if
youre
willing
to
step
up
on
the
abvs
just
a
touch
go
for
the
heavy
seas
great
pumpkin
d
very
drinkable
beer
with
less
pumpkin
flavor
than
i
had
expected
actually
very
balanced
compared
to
many
beers
of
the
style
in
my
personal
opinion
the
more
pumpkin
the
better
this
didnt
have
as
much
as
i
would
have
liked
but
still
a
very
good
offering
very
drinkable
and
well
rounded
flavors
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
but
not
really
in
a
good
way
it
is
refreshing
but
not
hearty
and
comforting
like
most
fall
offerings
this
is
not
the
worst
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
but
it
is
also
far
from
the
best
the
color
was
a
nice
orange
for
a
crisp
michigan
night
the
head
was
just
right
not
too
foamy
i
really
love
the
label
too
the
artwork
fits
perfectly
drinkability
comes
across
as
a
dry
heavily
spiced
amber
ale
more
than
a
pumpkin
ale
very
refreshing
even
if
not
quite
as
expected
the
battle
cap
said
quaff
on
the
inside
which
is
very
fitting
for
this
beer
d
really
kind
disappointed
in
this
beer
thought
it
would
be
a
lot
better
than
it
was
but
it
really
failed
me
dont
need
to
try
this
one
again
i
havent
really
found
a
pumpkin
beer
that
i
like
backyard
bonfires
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
this
year
this
beer
pours
with
a
deep
dark
hazy
golden
color
the
head
is
lovely
but
doesnt
hang
around
for
long
it
does
however
leave
a
beautiful
ring
around
the
glass
upon
first
sniff
there
are
very
distinct
notes
of
cinnamon
with
just
a
hint
of
clove
and
ginger
the
cinnamon
is
front
and
center
in
the
taste
it
finishes
with
a
little
pumpkin
pie
flavor
to
it
pretty
limited
hop
presence
just
a
bit
in
the
finish
overall
an
excellent
example
of
one
of
the
many
reasons
i
love
fall
so
much
but
as
with
all
fruitvegetable
beers
i
can
only
drink
so
many
in
one
sitting
which
is
maybe
a
good
thing
this
beer
pours
an
orangishgolden
body
with
a
gentle
carbonation
of
tiny
bubbles
and
a
thin
cream
head
that
is
a
bit
soapy
the
body
has
a
very
faint
haze
to
it
the
smell
of
gingerbread
spices
and
graham
crackers
is
strong
but
not
chemical
a
note
of
honey
and
some
pale
malt
along
with
a
faint
spiciness
that
might
be
hops
give
it
more
support
the
taste
of
ginger
and
cinnamon
with
some
nutmeg
and
pale
malt
give
this
a
spicy
taste
note
of
pepper
and
a
carbonic
acid
or
chalkiness
combine
with
the
dry
taste
at
the
finish
medium
mouthfeel
with
no
astringency
or
alcohol
warmth
this
beer
has
a
very
good
balance
of
spices
and
has
some
good
malt
to
play
a
supporting
role
it
would
be
nice
to
see
some
more
malt
or
hops
or
alcohol
help
balance
the
spices
perhaps
dm
nice
subtle
carbonation
really
brings
out
the
flavor
while
being
a
full
beer
its
not
too
over
powering
and
would
be
great
on
a
cold
day
this
beer
was
alright
iv
noticed
this
year
that
im
not
digging
the
pumpkin
ales
as
much
as
i
was
last
year
maybe
my
palate
changed
maybe
my
im
just
bored
with
them
or
maybe
my
memories
of
how
they
tasted
last
year
are
exaggerated
to
i
feel
like
im
being
let
down
that
being
said
both
my
brother
and
girlfriend
loved
this
beer
so
to
each
their
own
have
one
more
bottle
left
and
ill
give
it
a
shot
at
halloween
poured
a
clear
amber
body
w
a
onefinger
head
that
died
quick
and
left
minimal
lace
on
top
of
a
rather
pedistrian
aroma
as
barely
any
spices
poke
out
aroma
seems
to
be
muted
for
some
reason
a
creamy
stiff
pumpkin
beer
that
isnt
bad
but
seems
like
its
been
made
for
mass
consumption
the
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
spice
are
minimal
and
the
beer
passes
very
lightly
even
watery
for
a
pumpkin
beer
crisp
backbite
w
spicy
pepper
edge
is
decent
finish
a
good
beer
but
one
is
enough
for
me
d
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
dont
think
its
one
of
my
top
3
but
its
a
solid
beer
drinkability
its
alright
i
would
have
preferred
it
to
have
been
a
litter
heavier
and
had
some
of
a
pumpkin
taste
but
it
was
rather
drinkable
even
with
all
the
spice
all
in
all
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
im
usually
not
a
spice
beer
kind
of
guy
but
this
one
kept
my
interest
for
the
most
part
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
really
smooth
for
a
spice
beer
pumpkin
ales
can
vary
a
lot
in
flavor
but
this
one
is
towards
the
spicy
end
of
the
category
id
say
its
a
good
beer
in
general
and
i
would
buy
this
one
again
especially
if
it
was
a
6pack
or
on
tap
dpretty
high
i
thought
i
would
drink
it
all
night
as
a
decent
beer
but
would
not
buy
it
if
i
was
looking
for
a
pumpkin
beer
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
was
played
pretty
well
it
has
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
semi
full
and
creamy
feel
pumpkins
could
have
played
into
this
as
far
as
i
know
thats
predominately
what
they
are
for
anyways
d
yeah
i
really
do
like
pumpkin
beers
i
like
that
this
doesnt
stray
to
far
towards
sweetartificial
flavors
that
often
turn
folks
off
to
the
style
spice
and
earthy
dryness
are
good
things
still
this
wont
rank
among
the
better
ones
ive
had
worthy
of
a
try
especially
if
you
like
the
style
overall
its
a
great
pumpkin
a
lot
of
breweries
screw
this
up
but
i
think
new
holland
took
a
good
route
still
cant
compete
with
my
yearly
homebrew
pumpkin
but
thats
kind
of
the
point
overall
i
have
had
many
many
many
pumpkin
beers
and
this
will
be
a
one
and
done
for
me
as
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
both
imperial
and
regular
versions
drinks
average
at
best
there
are
other
pumpkins
that
i
would
much
rather
drink
not
the
best
pumpkin
ever
but
certainly
serviceable
and
well
worth
trying
to
me
theres
nothing
more
welcoming
in
fall
than
the
aroma
of
pumpkin
roasting
in
the
oven
one
sniff
of
this
beer
and
i
am
reminded
of
that
feeling
this
clear
medium
amber
brew
has
a
wonderfully
roasty
malt
and
pumpkin
spice
balanced
flavor
good
mouthfeel
and
body
finish
is
clean
malt
and
pumpkin
nods
to
birchstick
for
this
one
great
trade
worth
a
shot
and
not
to
mention
very
easily
drinkable
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
stone
ris
snifter
poured
an
amber
to
dark
brown
with
about
a
half
inch
of
head
the
aroma
consisted
of
mostly
nutmeg
with
a
little
bit
of
pumpkin
thrown
in
the
taste
was
the
same
the
pumpkin
wasnt
as
much
of
a
factor
as
i
would
have
liked
and
i
couldnt
tell
cinnamon
was
even
used
it
seems
like
they
used
too
much
of
the
nutmeg
i
did
kill
my
6
pack
of
this
over
memorial
day
weekend
so
it
was
pretty
enjoyable
however
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
i
felt
they
could
have
done
better
tried
this
brew
and
going
from
memory
wasnt
a
huge
fan
last
time
i
had
it
several
years
ago
but
funny
going
from
memory
i
was
never
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
vegetable
or
fruit
beers
in
general
but
on
my
revisit
i
have
to
say
it
has
grown
on
me
now
that
i
went
to
the
store
with
a
taste
for
a
spiced
beer
someone
mentioned
great
lakes
christmas
ale
a
few
weeks
back
so
this
one
hit
the
spot
ok
so
the
color
lets
say
burnt
pumpkin
orange
it
looks
malty
but
doesnt
smell
overwhelmingly
malty
and
has
some
hops
to
balance
things
out
a
little
ultimately
this
beer
smells
like
a
pumpkin
pie
on
first
whiff
like
a
fresh
grandmas
pumpkin
pie
not
a
canned
pumpkin
pie
filling
or
a
stale
beer
frat
house
mixed
with
pumpkin
flavoring
but
a
nicely
put
together
pumpkin
beer
and
hell
it
tastes
the
same
way
too
so
for
what
it
is
worth
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
tried
to
date
cause
this
will
probably
be
the
last
pumpkin
beer
this
season
maybe
it
got
an
unfair
advantage
given
my
history
with
it
but
i
do
have
good
tastes
and
i
know
what
i
am
doing
so
trust
me
this
one
is
good
it
is
worthy
if
you
truly
want
a
pumpkin
pie
beer
now
do
you
d
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
by
any
means
however
i
think
there
is
too
much
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
that
amplify
flavors
i
enjoy
being
more
complementary
rather
than
dominating
in
pumpkin
ales
worth
a
try
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
schlafly
when
it
comes
to
buying
pumpkin
ales
drinkability
a
fairly
average
pumpkin
ale
but
still
a
good
one
glad
i
got
to
try
this
as
its
not
available
in
ny
i
think
but
if
it
were
it
would
not
be
the
first
pumpkin
ale
id
go
for
d
easy
to
drink
and
taste
good
more
of
a
dinner
beer
then
session
one
though
t
very
cinnamony
at
times
its
like
a
cinnamon
roll
other
spices
create
a
blend
pumpkin
helps
sweeten
things
up
as
it
warms
hops
become
slightly
noticeable
at
the
finish
they
are
grassy
d
drinkable
but
not
particularly
memorable
i
poured
this
one
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
it
poured
a
watery
translucent
charcoal
tinged
orange
with
almost
no
head
the
smell
is
rich
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
real
pumpkin
and
perhaps
ginger
the
taste
is
pretty
bold
and
very
spicy
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
are
at
the
forefront
its
almost
bitter
with
the
spiciness
its
light
and
crisp
and
refreshing
ive
certainly
had
better
pumpkin
beers
so
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
the
ichabod
went
surprisingly
well
with
a
bowl
of
dolledup
pickledvegetable
flavored
ramen
noodles
with
lemongrass
tofu
cilantro
and
vegetables
still
not
my
cup
of
tea
though
except
maybe
as
a
party
novelty
this
is
my
first
beer
into
the
pumpkin
realm
the
pour
into
a
pint
glass
was
a
orange
color
almost
no
head
at
all
just
a
white
haze
lines
the
top
of
the
glass
the
drinking
of
this
beer
is
one
that
i
really
enjoyed
the
pumpkin
is
subtle
but
still
strong
enough
to
know
what
im
drinking
i
put
down
3
of
these
without
thinking
twice
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
more
pumpkin
beers
next
fall
i
would
recommend
this
to
anybody
who
was
curious
about
it
thanks
to
the
balance
and
light
body
this
is
pretty
drinkable
id
certainly
recommend
it
to
fans
of
the
style
although
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
with
its
slight
emphasis
on
clean
malts
over
pumpkin
hazy
orange
body
topped
by
a
very
thin
ring
of
fine
bubbles
aroma
is
faintly
of
pumpkin
pie
nutmeg
comes
through
the
most
flavor
is
a
bit
metallic
somewhat
artificial
tasting
the
pumpkin
spices
just
dont
blend
with
the
malt
and
hop
profile
body
is
also
a
little
thin
seems
almost
watery
with
respect
to
the
pumpkin
flavor
drinkability
is
poor
i
saved
a
few
of
these
hoping
they
would
improve
but
its
still
the
same
disappointing
beer
i
bought
in
the
fall
that
being
said
nobodys
perfect
most
of
new
hollands
line
is
well
above
average
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
the
spices
become
a
little
much
for
me
after
a
while
its
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
my
personal
preference
is
more
pumpkin
and
less
spices
and
this
leans
more
on
the
spices
then
the
pumpkin
a
fine
brew
a
fine
pumpkin
but
more
spiced
than
pumpkiny
for
some
reason
i
had
this
impression
that
new
holland
was
a
good
brewery
but
im
starting
to
think
its
more
mediocre
than
anything
else
in
any
case
drinkable
if
not
memorable
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
of
the
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
i
would
put
this
in
second
place
behind
ofallon
i
like
the
fact
that
the
spices
are
not
overpowering
which
definitely
adds
to
the
drinkability
like
other
new
holland
brews
a
tasty
effort
but
certainly
not
the
best
in
the
style
drinks
well
definately
sessionable
as
for
drinkability
one
of
these
was
plenty
and
i
was
ready
to
look
for
something
different
even
if
it
was
a
different
pumpkin
beer
it
sounds
like
im
really
cracking
on
this
beer
and
i
dont
mean
to
but
it
is
very
average
and
well
kinda
boring
a
rather
bland
beer
and
theres
a
taste
of
pumpkin
but
without
much
spicing
that
would
be
okay
i
guess
but
the
base
beer
isnt
that
interesting
stillinall
it
drinks
well
enough
as
it
is
inoffensive
and
isnt
too
sweet
or
spicy
d
this
one
may
end
up
being
a
drain
pour
for
me
but
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
i
think
id
like
this
more
if
it
was
a
stout
flavored
with
pumpkin
not
something
this
light
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
with
about
a
finger
of
head
the
head
dissapeared
before
i
was
done
smelling
the
beer
almost
no
smell
whatsoever
pumpkin
taste
is
very
subtle
but
tends
become
more
evident
as
a
slightly
spicy
aftertaste
not
nearly
as
overpowering
as
most
pumpin
beers
ive
had
i
enjoy
the
more
subtle
flavoring
solid
but
not
a
great
choice
but
better
than
most
pumpkin
beers
purchased
from
discount
liquor
in
milwaukee
wi
pours
a
very
hazy
pale
amber
body
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
pie
spices
most
notably
nutmeg
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
nutmeg
and
spices
are
up
front
with
the
malt
sweetness
some
faint
pumpkin
flavors
are
noticed
in
the
finish
a
good
pumpkin
beer
but
not
my
favorite
strange
taste
to
me
hard
to
describe
somewhat
bitter
with
no
real
pumpkin
or
pumpkin
spice
taste
hint
of
pumpkin
spice
in
after
taste
it
was
drinkable
but
not
very
pumpkin
drinkability
decent
beer
for
the
season
goes
down
easy
and
hits
the
spot
if
you
are
looking
for
the
style
overall
another
less
then
impressive
pumpkin
ale
to
add
to
my
list
of
beers
i
never
have
to
try
again
full
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
to
me
is
like
a
water
with
some
pumpkin
spice
to
it
not
alot
going
on
here
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
wants
a
light
craft
pumpkin
brew
people
rip
on
shipyards
pumpkin
and
i
think
that
one
is
better
b
is
my
overall
thoughts
like
the
other
new
holland
brews
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
people
to
the
style
however
for
dedicated
followers
it
seems
a
bit
on
the
mild
side
d
a
respectable
pumpkin
ale
but
not
much
more
than
that
quite
timid
all
the
way
around
not
offputting
in
any
way
just
uninspired
highly
quaffable
d
light
enough
to
swig
down
a
few
cheers
note
i
did
not
notice
too
much
of
a
cask
nature
to
this
beer
d
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
a
bit
too
much
pumpkin
for
me
pours
a
light
golden
oranange
in
color
some
haze
present
moderate
fluffy
head
with
minimal
lacing
smell
is
of
grains
bread
unsweetened
pumpkin
puree
taste
is
malt
forward
with
mild
unsweetened
pumpkin
puree
minimal
fall
spicing
as
opposed
to
pumpkin
pie
spicing
if
you
get
my
drift
light
bodied
full
carbonation
becomes
creamier
as
it
sits
tastes
more
like
an
english
pale
ale
with
pumpkin
notes
than
a
full
blown
pumpkin
ale
drinkabiltyi
could
throw
a
few
of
these
back
very
pleasant
balanced
subtle
pumpkin
taste
with
a
nice
color
that
has
halloween
written
all
over
it
mediumlight
body
with
appropriate
carbonation
none
of
the
flavor
components
are
overwhelming
which
certainly
aids
the
drinkability
not
a
bad
start
to
my
mini
pumpkin
ale
tasting
d
i
could
definitely
see
putting
a
few
of
these
down
not
anything
special
but
a
good
beer
for
the
season
i
was
not
a
big
fan
of
the
flavor
profile
but
coupled
with
the
lighter
body
and
crisp
finish
it
makes
it
slightly
more
drinkable
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
this
season
so
far
looking
to
expand
further
with
the
pumpkin
ale
soon
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
ale
that
isnt
too
subtle
or
too
assertive
definitely
try
this
one
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
pumpkin
ale
this
is
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
for
a
fall
seasonal
not
as
good
as
pumking
but
still
very
good
definately
worth
a
shot
while
theres
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
others
that
ive
had
in
this
and
past
seasons
overall
pretty
good
beer
its
my
first
pumpkin
beer
ever
and
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
a
few
others
in
the
future
it
goes
well
with
the
fall
season
drinkability
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
sampled
not
heavy
on
the
spice
a
prominent
sweet
pumpkin
taste
a
very
drinkable
brew
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
you
gotta
like
the
labels
with
the
headless
horseman
drinks
really
easy
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
would
not
want
to
have
a
6
pack
of
this
maybe
3
or
4
but
not
six
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
out
there
but
not
the
worst
pretty
above
average
i
suppose
d
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
nothing
offensive
or
out
of
whack
to
this
one
but
it
could
use
a
more
pumpkiny
flavor
its
rather
herbal
and
surprisingly
unsweetened
although
not
really
in
a
bad
way
an
accessible
pumpkin
ale
and
a
worthwhile
fall
seasonal
poured
an
amber
with
a
respectable
head
that
faded
to
a
patchy
skin
the
aroma
was
mild
squash
the
taste
was
weak
this
is
a
beer
that
you
can
spice
the
hell
out
of
so
why
weak
mouth
feel
was
light
bodied
with
a
ample
carbonation
drinkability
was
ok
taste
was
weak
beer
was
weak
im
disappointed
in
new
holland
with
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
is
an
ok
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
but
it
is
a
little
watery
and
lacks
depth
of
any
kind
i
didnt
previously
comment
but
this
is
a
very
pricey
seasonal
i
understand
that
costs
for
a
low
volume
brew
might
be
slightly
higher
but
if
the
end
product
taste
isnt
exceptional
the
high
price
is
not
justifiable
it
is
well
made
and
free
from
any
skunkiness
or
other
rudeness
10
99
for
6
was
steep
though
a
good
fall
seasonal
i
think
pretty
clear
copper
colored
body
small
white
head
doesnt
last
for
too
long
nose
is
mostly
pumpkin
with
some
malt
probably
some
cinnamon
notes
as
well
taste
is
pretty
complex
for
the
style
malt
front
with
pumpkin
obviously
along
with
cinnamon
and
some
other
spice
notes
as
well
kind
of
a
thin
mouth
fairly
wet
i
kind
of
like
the
pumpkin
beers
as
a
fall
treat
anyways
but
this
one
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
pretty
tasty
overall
a
nice
offering
for
the
season
i
would
buy
again
d
a
decent
beer
that
fits
the
style
well
a
basic
and
straightforward
beer
but
fine
to
enjoy
drinkability
pumpkin
beers
tend
to
not
be
very
exciting
but
this
one
is
quite
nice
cant
wait
to
have
more
when
it
gets
a
little
cooler
outside
this
is
an
excellent
choice
when
making
the
pumpkin
ale
selection
i
will
be
buying
up
quite
a
bit
of
this
brew
before
the
season
is
out
pours
a
glowing
copper
orange
body
with
a
bright
white

with
fine
speckled

it

up
a
nice
vegetable
gourd
smell
with
pumpkin
pie
spice
additions
flavor
has
a
nice
base
beer
before
the
pumpkin

spice
additions
very
balanced
between

pumpkin
ale
and
spice
ale
if
that
makes
any
sense
each
component
is
in
balance
with
each
other
it
doesnt
hit
me
over
the
head
with
spice
or
pumpkin
and
at
the
end
of
it
i
know
its
still
a
beer
not
too
candy
with
the
subtle
spicing
is
a
win
in
my
book
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
touch
of
stickiness
but
never
becomes
cloying
carbonation
level
is
on
with
a
bit
of
effervescence
carrying
things
along
drinkability
overall
is
what
every
pumpkin
beer
should
be
able
to
pull
off
balance
and
a
nice
level
of
drinkability
pours
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
bit
of
nice
head
and
lacing
nice
clean
scent
slightly
malty
with
just
hints
of
pumpkin
good
flavor
a
nice
malty
beer
with
the
slightest
hints
of
pumpkin
and
spice
not
the
deepest
pumpkin
ale
nor
my
favorite
but
a
good
one
for
starting
someone
out
that
way
if
they
like
a
nice
amber
ale
goes
down
very
smooth
drinkability
not
too
bad
flavors
are
ok
and
they
get
better
as
the
drink
warms
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
that
ive
had
thus
far
but
far
from
the
worst
i
think
that
distinction
would
go
to
buffalo
bills
its
easy
to
drink
a
little
refreshing
and
the
abv
is
quite
moderate
so
its
not
like
youre
going
to
be
hammered
after
one
or
two
had
high
hopes
for
this
elusive
pumpkin
ale
from
ichabod
in
michigan
which
as
i
understand
just
recently
began
shipping
to
nj
their
pumpkin
ale
leaves
much
to
be
desired
bland
lacking
adequate
carbonation
flavor
essence
and
style
regular
at
best
and
definitely
nothing
to
write
home
about
peace
lady
m
i
guess
i
dont
really
know
what
i
was
expecting
this
was
my
first
pumpkin
beer
but
it
didnt
seem
to
have
much
pumpkin
flavor
to
it
ill
have
to
try
a
different
kind
soon
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
reddish
gold
with
a
finger
of
white
head
fairly
subdued
nose
of
typical
pumpkin
pie
spices
cinnamon
allspice
ginger
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
amount
of
malt
more
of
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
in
the
flavor
also
a
fair
amount
of
hops
that
show
up
in
the
finish
solid
pumpkin
beer
maybe
a
bit
restrained
easy
enough
to
drink
just
wish
it
had
more
flavor
to
be
more
appealing
to
do
so
d
this
is
a
very
approachable
beer
for
the
style
one
that
is
quite
drinkable
rather
than
just
a
big
spice
bomb
now
that
ive
tasted
it
the
aroma
is
changing
a
bit
but
the
beer
itself
feels
hollow
like
its
job
isnt
quite
being
achieved
i
think
that
the
ultimate
goal
of
brewing
a
pumpkin
beer
is
to
achieve
a
beer
that
tastes
more
like
pumpkin
pie
not
pumpkin
itself
this
one
tastes
more
like
a
cracker
with
some
spices
thrown
on
top
drinkability
not
bad
i
could
drink
this
again
its
not
spectacular
though
mouthfeel
is
just
about
perfect
really
a
pleasant
finish
and
and
a
good
feeling
drinks
slowly
and
i
really
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
a
couple
at
one
time
good
but
not
great
blipped
headless
horseman
by
pigmy
love
circus
picked
this
one
up
just
to
try
it
as
ive
only
had
one
other
pumpkin
ale
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
color
with
virtually
no
head
what
head
is
there
is
a
white
and
disappears
quickly
leaves
little
if
any
lacing
down
the
glass
there
isnt
much
to
the
smell
some
spices
and
maybe
some
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
in
there
luckily
there
is
more
to
the
taste
spices
right
away
and
then
some
pumpkin
in
the
aftertaste
i
was
hoping
for
more
pumpkin
taste
but
still
there
its
there
i
was
just
hoping
for
a
bit
more
goes
down
refreshingly
though
i
think
a
little
more
pumpkin
taste
comes
out
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
overall
it
isnt
bad
i
may
pick
it
up
again
but
im
going
to
try
some
others
first
if
given
the
opportunity
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
though
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
a
very
light
pumpkin
ale
doubt
i
buy
another
6er
this
year
this
beer
makes
me
want
some
schlafly
pumkin
now
thats
a
pumkin
beer
with
some
booze
and
heat
needed
for
those
cold
fall
nights
but
it
still
is
summer
and
new
hollands
fits
the
bill
i
guess
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
is
good
for
a
pumpkin
beer
this
one
has
the
spiced
character
and
the
herbal
notes
that
are
true
to
style
but
overall
it
lacks
body
and
richness
with
more
substantial
malt
notes
and
a
bit
more
body
this
could
be
a
great
pumpkin
beer
pours
an
orangish
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
head
the
head
disappears
quickly
and
gives
way
to
very
little
lacing
the
smell
is
of
pumpkin
and
ginger
and
maybe
nutmeg
the
smell
is
a
strong
pumpkin
the
taste
is
of
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
with
some
ginger
the
taste
is
a
little
strong
than
the
post
road
pumpkin
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
it
is
slightly
harsh
overall
it
is
a
medium
of
the
good
drinkable
beer
you
could
drink
a
six
pack
but
more
than
that
and
the
pumpkin
might
be
too
much
overall
not
something
i
would
drink
again
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
my
style
it
is
interesting
and
worth
a
shot
but
nothing
to
buy
or
drink
a
lot
of
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
medium
apricot
color
with
about
a
finger
of
eggshell
colored
foam
the
head
fades
after
a
few
minutes
smells
and
tastes
of
mildly
spiced
pumpkin
bread
with
notes
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
this
pumpkin
ale
is
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
for
the
style
try
mixing
ichabod
with
some
southern
tier
creme
brulee
stout
very
tasty
final
thought
a
little
disappointed
in
new
holland
for
placing
this
inferior
brew
in
an
excellent
seasonal
12pack
ill
let
this
one
pass
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
overall
its
fairly
drinkable
brew
but
its
lack
of
interesting
characteristics
might
make
me
lose
interest
not
too
bad
but
the
strong
spices
limit
the
drinkability
spiciness
is
kept
in
check
sweet
pumpkin
and
breadlike
flavors
with
a
pretty
surprising
hop
bitterness
smooth
and
creamy
from
good
carbonation
and
easy
to
drink
most
of
all
its
very
clean
tasting
and
feeling
update
i
bought
several
new
holland
beers
in
one
of
the
brewerys
variety
packs
i
experimented
by
mixing
half
of
an
ichabod
with
half
of
a
cabin
fever
brown
ale
and
loved
it
the
whole
was
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
lighter
flavor
than
the
nose
indicates
earthy
hops
and
mild
spices
are
the
most
noticeable
tastes
fresh
and
somewhat
lageresque
a
decent
fall
session
beer
and
might
even
be
passable
for
a
festbier
somewhat
tasty
but
not
at
all
memorable
the
hit
on
the
tongue
is
thin
rather
clean
and
crisp
finishes
with
a
little
more
body
as
the
pumpkin
flavor
builds
left
me
wishing
for
a
tad
more
malt
in
the
body
to
balance
the
taste
overall
this
turned
out
to
be
a
nice
beer
nothing
special
but
pumpkin
ales
are
so
hard
to
nail
have
to
give
this
one
credit
for
being
an
easy
drinker
good
call
for
a
6
pack
on
a
warm
fall
evening
pours
copper
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
some
sweet
pumpkin
in
the
background
that
blends
well
with
the
malt
medium
body
with
lots
of
sharp
carbonation
nice
pumpkin
flavorwith
just
a
touch
of
spice
very
crisp
and
refreshing
i
could
only
drink
maybe
one
at
a
sitting
but
a
solid
offering
for
sure
taste
its
much
better
here
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
much
more
apparent
as
are
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
id
prefer
to
have
a
tad
more
spice
flavor
its
definitely
skewed
toward
the
pumpkin
but
its
still
good
the
pumpkin
flavor
just
comes
across
too
much
it
is
malty
and
a
little
sweet
hops
emerge
on
the
tail
and
give
it
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
thats
a
nice
touch
that
works
really
well
here
it
finishes
dry
and
a
little
bitter
eric
ichabod
doesnt
blow
my
head
off
its
pretty
close
to
cottonwoods
pumpkin
ale
if
that
rings
a
bell
yet
despite
the
caramely
maltiness
not
quite
as
good
as
that
of
the
four
new
holland
beers
ive
had
so
far
this
is
the
only
one
that
even
approached
disappointing
but
its
okay
and
worth
a
try
dmoderately
drinkable
beer
one
of
the
several
enjoyable
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
i
like
that
the
pumpkin
flavors
are
not
so
overpowering
as
to
be
trying
on
my
tastebuds
instead
being
enjoyably
moderate
pours
a
clear
and
glowing
golden
orange
and
topped
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
frothy
white
head
held
up
under
a
few
lazy
ropes
of
carbonation
first
pumkin
beer
and
aroma
is
rather
interesting
slightly
smokey
with
whiffs
of
pumpkin
pie
and
a
dash
of
cinnamon
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
in
the
flavor
department
a
big
taste
of
ginger
and
cereal
grains
finishes
with
a
slightly
creamy
and
what
seems
to
be
vanilla
though
i
might
argue
otherwise
like
a
fake
vanilla
sweetness
i
sort
of
like
this
beer
i
have
to
admit
not
over
the
top
in
any
way
overall
thank
you
orbitalr0x
for
this
good
beer
i
liked
it
i
dont
drink
many
pumpkin
ales
but
i
would
drink
this
one
drinkability
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
can
have
a
couple
of
these
easily
d
pumpkin
beer
with
a
strong
pale
ale
foundation
the
spices
and
sweet
malt
against
zesty
hops
attain
a
pleasant
balance
that
oft
isnt
the
case
with
this
style
from
what
ive
tasted
but
ichabod
and
dogfish
head
punkin
genuinely
deserve
high
scores
drinkability
honestly
at
first
i
wasnt
impressed
by
this
pumpkin
ale
its
very
light
and
subtle
and
not
really
all
that
impressive
after
a
couple
more
pulls
im
appreciating
it
much
more
for
what
it
is
im
thinking
all
pumpkin
brews
have
to
be
big
and
intense
and
flavorful
which
this
is
not
but
im
liking
what
new
holland
is
going
for
here
very
drinkable
even
sessionable
pumpkin
ale
that
is
very
approachable
and
tasty
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
nice
bone
white
head
of
a
half
inch
and
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
slim
but
some
nice
nutmeg
cinnamon
pumpkin
were
there
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
again
good
spices
an
allaround
tasty
brew
with
a
bit
of
room
for
improvement
the
mouth
is
solid
easy
enough
to
drink
and
a
nice
session
pumpkin
ale
light
orangeamber
with
moderate
carbonation
crowned
with
big
off
white
head
the
head
dies
a
quick
death
nutmeg
and
allspice
greet
the
nose
unfortunately
not
much
pumpkin
backs
this
up
the
beer
lacks
sweetness
and
instead
has
mainly
a
bitter
earthy
aroma
when
you
sip
this
one
the
pumpkin
becomes
evident
among
the
above
mentioned
spices
again
very
little
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
thin
rather
bland
beer
that
fortunately
only
comes
once
a
year
d
i
love
new
holland
beers
but
this
was
a
total
miss
for
me
not
very
drinkable
for
me
due
to
the
unbalanced
and
odd
taste
profile
others
who
enjoy
the
taste
of
this
beer
wold
find
it
highly
sessionable
i
imagine
in
the
mouth
beer
is
smooth
well
carbonated
and
flavors
allow
for
a
medium
body
solid
no
watery
finish
and
little
to
no
alcohol
presence
that
i
get
with
some
other
pumpkin
brews
drinkability
is
good
i
can
drink
a
couple
of
these
at
one
sitting
d
i
was
obligated
to
a
six
pack
and
it
took
me
a
few
weeks
to
finally
finish
it
i
wouldnt
but
it
again
the
aftertaste
kind
of
turned
me
off
to
this
particular
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
better
this
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
touch
of
amber
shading
the
foamy
cream
colored
cap
retains
wellbefore
leaving
some
smallpatchy
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
and
maltywith
hints
of
cinnamon
and
other
subtle
spices
this
is
a
really
nice
pumpkin
brew
bigbold
and
fresh
pumpkin
pie
flavors
are
very
realistic
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
upfrontfollowed
by
lightly
roasted
malts
that
taste
like
graham
crackers
this
pumpkin
ale
is
pretty
light
bodied
in
comparison
to
some
of
the
others
i
have
hadthe
carbonation
is
also
very
light
and
almost
non
existent
by
the
last
couple
swallows
this
one
hit
the
nail
on
the
headill
have
one
of
these
over
pumpkin
pie
any
day
overall
this
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
is
not
on
par
with
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
but
the
hop
aspect
of
this
sets
it
apart
and
allows
it
to
dominate
other
beers
of
the
style
d
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
or
two
but
that
goes
for
this
style
id
have
it
again
for
sure
this
has
a
pretty
standard
pumpkin
and
spice
character
but
with
lighter
malts
while
most
pumpkin
ales
have
an
amber
or
light
brown
base
this
is
more
like
a
pale
ale
for
plain
light
biscuit
malts
frankly
i
dont
think
it
works
as
well
as
typical
beers
from
the
style
the
slightly
lighter
body
makes
it
more
drinkable
but
the
sweet
pumpkin
flavor
is
offbalanced
and
not
as
pleasant
d
very
light
and
thin
simple
to
drink
not
my
style
of
brew
though
d
id
rather
have
bud
light
d
well
done
this
one
is
outstanding
this
is
the
most
authentic
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
although
that
authenticity
is
more
like
pumpkin
pie
filling
than
actual
pumpkins
thats
okay
because
who
eats
raw
pumpkin
anyhow
ichabod
is
a
pretty
standard
pumpkin
ale
a
tad
above
average
surely
better
than
those
pumpkins
that
use
flavoring
vs
the
real
thing
its
easy
to
drink
is
spiced
well
and
does
what
it
should
but
isnt
particularly
a
standout
fairly
drinkable
but
the
long
sweet
aftertaste
is
not
very
desirable
a
fairly
middleoftheroad
pumpkin
ale
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
spice
ale
not
really
a
huge
pumpkin
taste
better
quality
than
most
of
the
novelty
pumpkin
ales
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
goldencopper
color
with
a
quickly
diminishing
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
pleasant
noticeable
pumpkin
some
spices
clove
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
is
initially
kind
of
salty
a
little
spice
emerges
along
with
some
pumpkin
there
isnt
much
malt
or
hop
presence
and
hop
bitterness
is
low
enhanced
by
a
bit
of
tartness
carbonation
is
moderate
and
body
mediumfull
overall
an
interesting
brew
the
aroma
is
nice
but
the
flavor
isnt
it
could
use
more
beer
flavor
more
malt
or
more
hop
as
is
it
is
simply
a
bland
beer
with
a
bit
of
spicepumpkin
flavor
the
saltiness
upfront
is
also
quite
odd
i
didnt
finish
it
d
not
too
bad
of
a
brew
kind
of
got
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
one
worth
a
try
for
sure
drinkability
is
meh
i
wouldve
rather
tasted
the
pumpkin
than
the
inyourface
spices
this
is
the
second
pumpkin
ale
ive
tried
and
im
still
looking
for
a
really
good
one
i
think
i
will
seek
out
dogfish
heads
punkin
ale
next
to
see
how
that
stacks
up
this
is
about
as
average
as
it
gets
not
as
bad
as
shipyard
or
jacks
pumpkin
spice
but
it
still
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
poured
a
nice
amber
color
nice
2
finger
head
that
dissipated
rather
quckly
aroma
was
of
clove
and
alcohol
no
pumpkin
or
nutmeg
in
either
the
taste
or
smell
not
traditional
pumpkin
ale
good
beer
but
pumpkin
ale
should
well
taste
like
pumpkin
but
thats
just
me
good
overallbut
would
not
buy
again
d
good
beer
copperorange
with
a
white
head
fair
amount
of
lacing
smell
of
pumpkin
and
some
malt
when
i
taste
it
the
first
thing
that
i
notice
is
the
taste
of
pumpkin
pie
the
hops
dont
overpower
the
pumpkin
flavor
too
much
its
a
very
pleasant
beer
and
a
nice
break
from
the
octoberfests
this
time
of
year
d
could
be
i
just
dont
get
along
well
with
pumpkin
ales
this
just
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
okay
overall
ive
had
much
better
and
a
little
worse
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
the
flavor
isnt
much
of
an
improvement
sadly
all
i
get
are
slight
notes
of
pumpkin
spice
and
sweet
malts
before
an
overly
hoppybitter
aftertaste
washes
through
the
body
is
fizzy
and
thin
with
a
lingering
bitterness
that
doesnt
fit
the
style
or
benefit
the
experience
all
in
all
a
relatively
lackluster
brew
new
holland
is
either
hit
or
miss
and
this
one
definately
misses
in
my
book
d
this
is
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
and
i
would
definitely
take
a
couple
of
them
sometimes
spiced
beers
can
be
too
overpowering
or
cloying
but
this
one
is
not
probably
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
far
from
the
worst
i
would
push
for
a
bit
stronger
malt
flavor
and
a
little
fuller
body
but
all
in
all
a
good
beer
this
beer
is
really
worth
a
try
and
would
make
a
refreshing
session
drink
d
an
easy
drinker
certainly
and
i
wouldnt
turn
down
more
i
wouldnt
complain
with
a
little
more
robust
flavour
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
as
it
is
either
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
in
color
there
is
about
an
inch
of
head
forms
on
the
pour
but
is
gone
quickly
after
the
pour
smell
is
very
malty
with
subtle
spice
taste
is
more
of
the
malts
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
in
the
finish
easy
drinking
and
decent
pretty
basic
pumpkin
beer
mouthfeel
is
of
good
carbonation
spices
finish
while
the
malt
and
hop
start
things
off
nice
not
bad
d
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
but
it
would
work
better
with
food
than
on
its
own
the
middle
is
so
devoid
of
flavor
while
the
beginning
and
end
are
chock
full
of
bold
flavor
that
its
difficult
to
imagine
having
a
few
of
these
12oz
bottle
into
a
boston
lager
glass
pours
a
crisp
pale
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
was
sharp
pumpkin
spice
and
caramel
malt
the
pumpkin
spice
was
a
little
more
subdued
in
the
taste
but
still
present
caramel
malt
dominates
the
initial
and
the
pumpkin
flavor
seems
to
be
reserved
for
the
lingering
finish
the
beer
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
this
one
is
enjoyable
but
there
are
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
drinkability
overall
a
pretty
solid
and
highly
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
enough
flavors
to
balance
each
other
out
and
meld
well
as
the
brew
warms
glad
i
picked
up
a
6pack
new
holland
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
rarely
do
they
have
brews
that
are
less
than
solid
picked
up
a
few
singles
at
total
wine
cary
for
an
upcoming
pumpkin
themed
tasting
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
many
different
offerings
and
i
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
due
to
the
sweet
pumpkin
taste
and
no
harsh
bitterness
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
pretty
good
pumpkin
flavors
in
this
one
but
i
found
the
post
road
to
be
slightly
better
and
dfh
punkin
much
much
better
worth
a
shot
though
dquite
drinkable
dare
i
say
very
likable
but
if
i
wanted
a
pumpkin
ale
i
would
opt
for
something
else
the
pumpkin
emerges
more
and
more
weach
sip
but
never
rises
above
the
level
of
hop
bitterness
the
feel
of
the
drink
is
fine
but
im
not
compelled
to
drink
any
more
of
them
unremarkable
new
hollands
ichabod
pours
a
medium
amber
and
the
white
head
that
forms
is
decent
enough
it
begins
fluffy
and
is
retained
for
a
moment
before
dissolving
into
a
thin
surface
covering
the
smell
certainly
betrays
the
makers
intent
there
are
hint
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
brown
sugar
and
pumpkin
here
unfortunately
most
of
this
doesnt
seem
to
have
transferred
to
the
flavor
it
is
more
on
the
maltyhoppy
side
almost
like
english
pale
ale
with
a
touch
of
pumpkin
than
a
true
pumpkincentered
ale
very
little
or
no
sweetness
remains
and
the
bitter
hops
totally
consume
the
finish
and
aftertaste
leaving
no
room
for
true
pumpkinale
characteristics
its
certainly
not
unpleasant
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
reach
up
to
a
true
archetype
of
the
style
for
this
reviewer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
tart
and
sweet
smooth
and
easy
drinking
malty
definitely
for
bock
fans
several
of
these
fresh
would
be
welcome
only
had
a
single
theres
always
next
year
i
got
a
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
foamy
head
from
pouring
this
one
the
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
had
a
faint
spiciness
along
with
a
subtle
dryness
that
i
just
could
not
quite
quantify
the
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
light
cinnamon
flavor
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
a
really
nice
dryness
along
with
a
lingering
cinnamonspicy
flavor
better
than
jaw
jacker
but
still
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
that
i
have
had
the
clear
dark
gold
light
orange
beer
was
topped
by
a
cap
of
fine
white
foam
with
a
collar
of
large
soapy
bubbles
there
was
some
spotty
lacing
and
it
had
decent
head
retention
the
aroma
was
quite
earthy
with
notes
of
squash
and
musty
fruit
plus
a
bit
of
perfumy
spice
same
in
the
flavour
along
with
low
bitterness
but
there
was
also
a
bit
of
clove
spice
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
on
the
low
side
fine
carbonation
pretty
easy
drinking
the
spices
seemed
restrained
compared
to
other
pumpkin
beers
which
is
a
good
thing
the
best
ive
had
thus
far
was
2007s
ichabod
tripel
only
available
at
the
autumnfest
party
oh
man
i
wish
i
had
a
keg
of
that
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
white
head
which
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
malty
pumpkin
slight
cinammon
slight
nutmeg
and
caramel
the
taste
is
malty
slight
sweetness
pumpkin
cinammonnutmeg
and
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
a
tasty
pumpkin
ale
drinkability
not
much
with
pumpkin
beers
you
usually
expect
it
to
be
sweet
but
this
one
sure
surprised
me
with
the
kick
in
the
butt
that
it
gave
me
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
next
year
d
if
i
could
only
drink
pumpkin
beers
and
i
had
to
choose
only
one
i
might
easily
go
for
this
one
its
quite
drinkable
it
showcases
the
pumpkin
flavor
and
the
spices
are
a
great
compliment
without
throwing
pumpkin
pie
in
your
face
recommended
i
find
it
hard
to
drink
this
beer
for
an
extended
period
of
time
due
to
it
being
so
heavy
its
like
pumpkin
pie
and
thanksgiving
you
crave
it
sometimes
but
you
definitely
arent
going
to
make
this
a
standard
beer
to
drink
all
the
time
id
drink
this
again
as
its
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
by
far
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
subtle
creaminess
good
steady
carbonation
it
makes
itself
known
while
still
being
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
just
a
little
too
much
on
the
spices
for
me
not
really
a
brew
id
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
at
least
not
for
a
session
beer
but
this
would
probably
be
better
served
with
dessert
light
orange
in
color
without
a
significant
amount
of
foam
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
neither
a
spectacular
aroma
nor
taste
it
didnt
taste
bad
but
given
the
choice
between
this
beer
and
others
there
are
many
other
that
i
would
rather
drink
the
flavor
was
predominantly
bready
malt
with
the
pie
spices
mouthfeel
was
good
carbonation
was
adequate
overall
a
well
balanced
seasonal
beer
that
doesnt
load
up
the
spice
and
pumpkin
so
much
to
forget
that
its
a
beer
primarily
just
in
the
background
which
some
might
consder
a
fault
but
i
liked
because
it
give
the
hint
of
pumkin
and
spice
without
overwhelming
the
beer
or
my
senses
note
ive
had
this
beer
a
couple
times
in
the
past
and
finally
decided
to
review
it
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
ended
up
with
a
bad
bottle
it
had
floaters
in
it
and
came
out
tasting
super
bitter
im
glad
i
gave
it
another
chance
because
it
tasted
much
more
like
the
decent
beer
id
had
times
past
drinkability
a
disaster
when
i
first
tasted
this
in
2007
the
2011
version
is
nicely
balanced
with
just
enough
pumpkin
flavor
and
spicing
d
passable
but
one
of
the
weaker
pumpkin
ales
i
buy
it
every
year
hoping
to
be
surprised
and
so
far
i
find
it
hard
to
finish
the
6
pack
each
time
sadly
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
how
it
looks
light
body
with
a
rough
grainy
texture
uninteresting
beerjust
didt
seem
anything
like
most
of
the
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
not
a
beer
i
would
recomend
its
easy
to
drink
but
not
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
pumpkin
ale
im
disappointed
d
it
was
a
good
beer
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
taste
at
the
beginning
of
a
sip
with
less
aftertaste
the
body
is
light
and
spicy
kind
of
wheaty
too
theres
nothing
exceptionally
bad
about
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
ever
get
this
again
it
just
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
overall
this
is
a
pretty
mediocre
pumpkin
ale
pretty
thin
and
bland
really
but
not
offensively
spiced
there
are
better
ones
out
there
but
this
one
isnt
going
to
give
you
heartburn
like
some
d
i
find
this
to
be
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
2
or
3
might
do
it
honestly
the
spice
gets
dry
on
the
palate
after
the
second
i
love
pumpkin
ales
but
this
has
a
pretty
middle
of
the
road
flavor
standard
well
i
only
lost
1
75
by
buying
a
single
no
huge
loss
excellent
highly
recommended
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
did
not
hang
around
too
long
aromas
of
pumpkin
and
allspice
in
the
taste
allspice
pumpkin
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
a
bitter
spicey
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
clean
aftertaste
nice
hints
of
spice
and
pumpkin
mellow
with
a
nice
alcohol
presence
edit
wow
cloves
ahoy
after
sipping
this
for
a
while
a
genuine
spiciness
crept
up
on
my
tongue
and
could
be
described
as
nothing
but
pure
unadulterated
clove
nice
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
when
i
had
it
on
tap
but
im
liking
it
much
better
from
the
bottle
poured
a
honeyyellowcopper
color
with
a
small
white
head
not
much
retention
smells
very
malty
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
with
definite
buttery
pumpkin
tones
not
terribly
strong
on
the
spices
but
good
same
with
the
taste
malt
pumpkins
not
a
whole
lot
of
the
spice
aftertaste
of
the
malt
but
with
a
nice
balance
of
light
hops
you
dont
always
get
that
with
pumpkins
which
tend
to
go
the
sweeter
route
remarkably
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
i
really
like
how
it
feels
goes
with
the
buttery
quality
of
the
pumpkin
i
still
prefer
my
pumpkin
ales
a
little
more
spicy
but
this
is
good
a
fine
example
of
a
session
pumpkin
ale
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
but
not
remarkable
pumpkin
ale
i
would
recommend
letting
this
one
warm
up
a
bit
before
drinking
the
true
flavors
really
come
out
a
lot
more
this
is
my
first
fall
seasonal
of
the
year
and
i
am
happy
with
it
its
time
to
crack
open
another
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
in
general
it
has
a
strong
pumpkin
note
obviously
but
its
also
has
a
bit
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
still
very
good
pour
with
a
decent
light
brown
head
fairly
easy
to
drink
so
if
you
like
pumpkin
have
a
few
not
the
best
but
pretty
damn
good
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
in
some
the
pumpkin
takes
a
backseat
but
in
this
it
is
right
there
for
you
to
enjoy
recommended
best
fresh
d
awesome
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
drinkability
was
about
average
for
one
beer
more
than
one
forget
it
this
is
past
its
prime
due
to
biegaman
being
insistent
on
trying
it
pours
a
hazed
golden
small
white
head
forms
disappears
pretty
quick
some
lace
spots
smell
is
odd
kind
of
funky
rotten
pumpkin
some
spice
toffee
vegetables
almost
vinegar
taste
is
a
bit
better
funky
spices
pumpkin
very
vegetable
like
weak
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
light
to
medium
carbonation
odd
keeps
things
in
perspective
will
get
a
fresher
bottle
next
year
thanks

pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
huge
runaway
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
covering
of
bubbles
in
a
few
minutes
smell
is
creamy
even
slightly
soapy
with
some
noticeable
spice
the
taste
is
creamy
and
silky
from
the
pumpkin
and
there
are
noticeable
hits
of
nutmeg
and
cinammon
some
hops
in
the
back
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
not
bad
and
the
carbonation
is
right
moderately
drinkable
d
the
only
constructive
critism
i
can
offer
is
again
this
beer
lacked
a
dominating
flavor
to
it
it
lacked
the
characteristics
that
are
essential
to
pumpkin
beers
it
felt
watered
down
and
lacked
a
strong
malt
character
the
flavors
that
were
present
were
very
subtle
and
lacked
uniqiness
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
simply
did
not
stick
out
at
all
amongst
the
other
pumpkin
beers
available
light
copper
color
with
some
thin
lacing
sweet
malts
light
fruits
cinnamon
and
some
faint
nutmeg
in
the
nose
immediate
pumpkin
flavor
in
the
first
sip
and
some
noticeable
hops
notes
for
a
nice
balance
clove
and
cinnamon
round
out
the
nice
pumpkin
flavor
but
doesnt
over
run
it
yeasty
and
bready
and
some
mild
brown
sugar
sweetness
thin
body
and
a
watery
mouthfeel
that
leaves
a
bubbly
alcoholic
residue
in
the
finish
plenty
of
carbonation
to
the
end
but
a
bit
more
than
id
prefer
from
this
style
on
the
good
side
this
brew
makes
better
use
of
pumpkin
than
others
ive
had
poured
out
extremely
clear
orangey
yellow
color
with
little
head
or
lacing
the
nose
had
plenty
of
nutmeg
along
with
cinnamon
and
something
graham
crackerlike
the
taste
offered
subtle
pumpkin
flavors
with
lots
of
nutmeg
and
some
allspice
clove
cinnamon
and
ginger
not
a
tremendous
amount
of
malt
of
pumpkin
here
though
fairly
carbonated
but
the
spice
sticks
to
your
tongue
in
an
unwelcome
way
d
overall
not
much
flavor
i
really
had
to
hunt
for
anything
other
than
malt
and
generic
bittering
hops
drinkable
but
not
favorable
may
have
to
try
it
again
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
dud
as
i
remember
it
having
more
pumpkin
flavor
definitely
not
enough
pumpkin
flavor
for
the
style
served
in
a

of

but
nothing
overpowering
smooth

mouthfeel
carbonation
very
minimal
compared
to
years
past
this
years
version
is
much
more
drinkable
in
the
past
it
was
very
sweet
and
onetwo
was
enough
for
me
this
year
as
with
a
number
of
the
brewerys
other
beers
the
beer
seems
to
be
toned
down
to
appeal
to
a
greater
number
of
people
hence
the
increased
drinkability
but

is
easy
to
drink
but
i
would
prefer
other
beers
based
on
taste
i
think
this
beer
makes
a
better
spiced
beer
than
a
pumpkin
beer
newer
updated
betterlooking
label
for
the
2006
season
this
really
seems
to
be
an
average
pumpkin
ale
faint
notes
of
pumpkin
are
slightly
noticeable
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
but
mostly
masked
by
the
characteristics
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
other
fall
spices
worth
a
try
if
your
big
on
this
style
of
beer
the
carbonation
is
brisk
and
that
helps
overcome
a
slightly
thin
mouth
not
a
bad
effort
at
all
if
they
could
ramp
up
the
spices
a
notch
and
make
the
mouth
a
bit
fuller
this
would
be
a
top
of
the
line
offering
yellow
orange
body
with
a
white
head
not
much
retention
left
some
lacing
on
the
sides
a
very
light
pumpkin
aroma
mixed
with
some
spice
taste
was
about
the
same
as
the
smell
nothing
very
strong
and
its
what
youd
expect
from
a
pumpkin
ale
there
is
a
seltzerlike
finish
and
its
not
sweet
either
some
decent
carbonation
gives
it
a
spritzy
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
great
one
pretty
average
pale
orange
to
light
copper
with
a
small
offwhite
head
pumpkin
spice
sweetish
maltdough
nutmeg
taste
starts
with
doughy
sweetness
and
pumpkin
flavoring
caramel
notes
with
baking
spices
and
nutmeg
finish
is
mildly
bitter
with
lingering
spice
pumpkin
sure
enough
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
this
ale
poured
a
soft
orange
color
with
an
average
but
short
lived
creamy
white
head
and
little
lace
a
bit
on
the
cloudy
side
and
the
carbonation
was
moderate
a
nutmeg
smell
is
evident
but
not
over
powering
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
with
a
soft
but
noticeably
light
and
clean
finish
because
im
drinking
pumpkin
ale
i
would
appreciate
a
little
more
emphasis
on
the
pumpkin
spice
overall
a
nice
seasonal
beer
but
missing
that
little
extra
that
i
expect
from
seasonal
brew
to
put
it
over
the
top
d
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
as
it
hides
the
alchol
well
if
it
werent
for
the
burnt
toast
aftertaste
orangeish
amber
in
color
little
head
that
was
mainly
a
ring
spicy
aroma
like
spice
cake
or
pumpkin
pie
go
figure
the
flavor
was
much
of
the
same
thanksgiving
dessert
flavors
the
pumpkin
is
not
over
whelming
so
that
keeps
it
pretty
drinkable
kind
of
a
sparkling
mouthfeel
almost
not
bad
but
definitly
a
novelty
beer
sampled
at
from
the

dark

color
with
a
medium
eggshell
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
pumpkin
flavor
along
with
some
caramel
malt
the
finish
is
short
and
lightly
spiced
slightly
above
average
all
around
similar
to
many
other
pumpkin
ales
in
that
they
are
lightly
malted
pale
ales
with
added
spiciness
pumpkin
nutmeg
clove
cinamon
and
allspice
added
for
complexity
and
richness
however
the
malts
and
spices
keep
the
beer
a
bit
thin
turns
out
more
tealike
than
beerlike
herbal
and
spicy
but
lackluster
otherwise
moderately
clean
and
fresh
in
the
finish
but
never
rises
above
the
herbal
qualities
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
light
amber
in
color
but
cloudy
visual
carbonation
appears
moderate
but
head
development
was
very
thin
yes
it
was
a
correct
pour
the
aroma
is
very
lightly
hopped
with
hints
of
citrus
also
present
are
the
requisite
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
but
to
a
lesser
extent
than
i
would
expect
for
a
beer
of
this
style
taste
is
good
with
a
mild
pumpkin
flavor
and
hints
of
spice
and
nutmeg
tart
but
not
sour
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
slightly
dry
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
expected
the
pumpkin
flavor
to
be
more
robust
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
with
a
bit
of
a
thicker
body
the
body
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
it
finishes
dry
and
goes
down
easy
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
do
believe
that
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
i
will
probably
buy
this
beer
again
however
it
will
probably
be
this
season
as
i
will
be
trying
to
get
my
hands
on
as
many
pumpkin
ales
as
possible
overall
a
beer
that
does
a
good
job
showcasing
the
pumpkin
overall
i
was
hoping
for
a
big
flavorful
pumpkin
ale
but
this
was
weak
not
very
impressed
but
it
was
drinkable
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
goldorange
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
at
all
it
smells
mostly
like
spices
nutmeg
with
a
sweet
smell
theres
a
little
aroma
of
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
but
its
not
as
strong
as
the
nutmeg
is
it
tastes
like
nutmeg
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
cloves
but
theres
also
a
noticable
hoppiness
to
the
taste
its
pretty
well
balanced
its
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
not
too
much
it
goes
down
smooth
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
d
if
it
was
on
tap
and
it
was
a
nice
fall
night
i
would
definitly
buy
it
not
too
shabby
but
nothing
to
go
hunting
down

it

a
bit
thin
bodied
but
quite
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
pours
a
light
clear
and
golden
amber
hue
bubbles
are
almost
nonexistant
same
goes
for
lacing
looks
more
like
a
crappy
lager
than
an
ale
the
aroma
is
of
adjuncty
pumpkin
pie
spices
with
lots
of
water
and
a
little
malt
the
taste
starts
with
an
almost
astringent
start
of
crappy
nutmeg
then
becomes
crappy
cinnamon
more
like
pumpkin
spice
mix
tossed
into
the
fermenter
this
golden
hued
pumpkin
ale
pours
with
a
bright
white
head
and
smells
of
fresh
pumpkin
very
squashy
not
as
spicy
in
the
aroma
as
some
other
pumpking
beers
ive
sampled
the
fresh
pumpking
flavor
is
refreshing
and
plays
well
with
the
simple
crisp
malt
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
body
somwhat
light
the
finish
is
very
cris
and
pretty
dry
overall
a
very
crisp
beer
much
like
the
cool
clean
air
on
an
autumn
day
a
very
easy
drinker
an
excellent
alternative
to
drinking
an
octoberfestmarzen
is
to
have
an
ichabod
dits
good
but
1
is
enough
at
a
timelike
a
piece
of
pie
you
can
have
one
after
another
of
these
drinkability
nice
seasonal
beer
i
think
i
am
going
to
try
some
of
this
with
thanksgiving
dinner
interesting
enough
to
maybe
tempt
some
nonbeer
drinkers
to
try
very
clear
orangey
gold
color
flat
and
small
head
that
settles
out
as
a
skim
on
the
top
of
the
glass
after
40
seconds
decent
lace
dripping
rings
malty
aroma
fairly
rich
with
a
nutmeg
dominance
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
body
a
few
people
have
told
me
that
this
beer
drinks
like
an
oktoberfest
however
its
pretty
marked
by
pie
spice
possibly
showing
more
pumpkin
richness
in
resembling
the
pie
filling
as
much
by
simply
showcasing
the
spices
used
in
the
filling
itself
pretty
easydrinking
if
you
like
the
expected
setup
a
little
bit
of
green
leafy
sharpness
as
the
flavor
profile
rounds
out
id
say
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
rendition
not
overly
laden
with
spice
and
with
a
fairly
good
drinkability
to
me

the

it

an

i
wouldnt

more
than
one
of
these
of
these
in

which
are
cinnamon

it
is
quite
drinkable
still
i
wouldnt
buy
a
case
not
terrible
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
pumpkin
beer
style
a
little
too
much
pumpkin
spice
id
prefer
something
a
little
more
subtle
overall
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
pumpkin
beer
i
really
like
the
great
balance
between
the
malt
the
sweet
and
the
spice
solid
solid
pumpkin
beer
ill
get
a
bottle
or
two
next
autumn
this
beer
makes
you
want
to
sit
back
on
a
cool
fall
night
by
the
fire
place
while
over
looking
a
beautiful
fall
landscape
the
pumpkin
spices
fly
from
the
beer
straight
to
your
nose
the
beer
has
a
strong
cinnamon
and
ginger
its
almost
like
a
gingerbread
cookie
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
to
balance
it
out
disappointing
considering
sam
adams
is
advertised
as
being
quality
craft
beer
not
what
i
expect
for
a
pumpkin
ale
its
lacking
in
flavor
and
seems
watered
down
this
beer
pours
with
a
small
creamcolored
head
that
settled
quickly
in
to
a
thin
layer
with
little
lacing
there
is
nice
clarity
to
the
amber
liquid
the
scent
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
leap
from
the
glass
making
me
long
for
whipped
cream
and
a
buttery
crust
small

cherry

the
flavor
is

and
a
little
unbalanced
tangy
bold

with
abundant

the
amber
malts
and
vague
pumpkin
flavor
struggle
to
keep
up
the

with
a
pithy
prickly

the

of
burnt

outside

there
is
little
pumpkin
to
be
found
here
its
a
gingerbread
house
in

despite
the
overriding
spice
themes
this
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
it
is
somehow
cleaner
than
many
of
the

offerings
which
seems
like
a

ive
had
this

many

before
but
that
was

i
considered
beer
a
hobby
after
having
so
many
well
regarding
pumpkin
ales
i
wasnt
expecting
this
to
be
able
to
compete
but
i
think
it
does
overall
decent
worth
getting
in
the
mixed
12
pack
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
whole
six
pack
of
just
this
savory
and
quite
succulent
the
beer
sides
with
spice
dryness
and
toast
although
sweetness
lingers
with
a
simmering
quality
its
warmth
is
aided
by
pie
spices
that
shore
up
the
beer
in
dessertlike
fashion
pretty
decent
pumpkin
beer
pumpkin
flavor
is
present
but
gets
a
little
more
overpowered
by
other
flavors
than
i
would
like
but
still
more
present
than
other
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
overall
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
i
didnt
like
last
years
but
this
years
has
grown
on
me
i
would
buy
it
again
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
and
that
is
never
a
bad
thing
the
smell
and
taste
were
not
overpowering
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoy
it
during
the
season

a

taste
had
pumpkin
the
beginning
but
became
overpowered
specifically
by
the
amount
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
not
a

just
a

one
note

you
know
this
wasnt
bad
at
all
with
a
pumpkin
beer
im
not
expecting
something
to
blow
me
away
i
just
desire
a
cozy
fall
vibe
with
it
and
this
one
certainly
does
that
i
feel
like
im
sitting
under
a
bright
orange
and
red
tree
at
sunset
in
the
fall
surrounded
by
leaves
with
this
beer
well
done
samuel
adams
well
done
i
would
drink
this
again
typical
pumpkin
ale
tons
of
pumpkin
and
spices
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
other
than
a
massive
spice
load
which
makes
it
tough
to
have
a
lot
of
a
bit
dry
but
refreshing
and
no
sacrifice
to
quality
nice
beautiful
amber
colored
beer
pours
with
a
nice
full
creamy
white
head
it
has
a
soft
pleasant
smell
doesnt
really
hit
you
in
the
face
with
the
pumpkin
in
the
smell
which
to
some
might
be
a
plus
id
prefer
a
little
more
pumpkin
smell
upon
sipping
its
a
bit
more
complex
tasting
for
a
beer
of
this
style
it
has
a
nice
spiced
pumpkin
flavor
that
stays
with
you
the
pumpkin
is
pretty
subtle
but
this
is
a
full
flavored
easy
drinking
beer
id
buy
it
again
if
there
werent
so
many
others
to
try
o
great
aroma
but
a
big
let
down
in
the
taste
ill
have
the
other
one
that
came
in
the
variety
pack
but
after
that
i
dont
see
myself
having
this
again
in
the
future

this
is

for
pumpkin

and
be
my
go
to
for
a

favorite
taste
and
easiness
to
drink
is
there
a
great
beer
overall
tastes
like
pumpkin
dark

cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
is
also
prominent
good
beer
has
a
great
autumn
feel
to
it
perfect
for
the

o
while
im
on
richness
of
the
flavors
i
do
wish
they
had
been
just
a
bit
richer
everything
was
decent
and
well
balanced
but
it
all
just
had
the
volume
turned
down
a
little
more
than
i
would
have
liked
i
expected
more
got
in
the

its
enjoyable
nonetheless

it
almost
drinks
more
like
a

then
a
pumpkin
ale
i
enjoy
this
beer
as
it
is
very
tasty
but
i
feel
it
falls
short
as
a
pumpkin
ale
since
the
pumpkin
is
overpowered
by
the
spice
glass
shaker
pint
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
and
the
seasonal
aftertaste
lingers
beautifully
overall
too
light
on
the
pumpkin
i
really
liked
this
beer
the
warmer
it
got
the
more
flavors
i
could
really
extract
out
of
this
beer
tasted
like
a
nice
crisp
ale
on
the
front
end
but
finished
with
a
great
sweetness
of
pumpkin
and
cloves
and
cinnamon
on
the
end
i
couldnt
really
pick
this
up
well
from
the
smell
but
it
was
such
a
great
beer
and
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
i
could
definitely
put
a
few
of
these
down
as
im
sitting
around
a
fire
and
enjoying
fall
changing
my
rating
to1
for
smell
and
look
alone
bought
two
more
6
packs
that
tasted
horrible
like
soap
or
straight
hops
called
them
and
complained
stay

from

in
black

on
the

ok
little
to
no

good

in
a
samuel

boston

sensory

decent
harvest
its
a
spicy
sweetleaning
pumpkin
ale
o
light
nice
pumpkin
beer
i
think
it
fits
the
style
decently
but
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
from
this
brewery
that
i
usually
love
i
dont
normally
care
for
this
style
but
this
is
a
good
one
o
definitely
towards
the
bottom
of
the
pile
of
pumpkin
beers
overall
i
really
like
this
it
is
unimpressive
in
a
few
aspects
but
i
like
the
taste
of
it
so
much
that
i
rate
it
a
bit
higher
okay
overall
yet
rather
disjointed
and
too
brash
flavorwise
the
initial
smell
is
most
appealing
yet
fades
way
too
quickly
even
at
room
temperature
and
the
finish
leaves
a
sort
of
metallic
twang
in
the
mouth
that
ultimately
distracts
from
any
remaining
good
points
not
bad
but
hardly
a
musthave
not
much
head
or
carbonation
in
this
pumpkin
ale
nice
deep
orange
hue
with
the
aroma
sense
very
nice
light
spice
notes
spices
linger
in
the
aftertaste
light
carbonation
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
one
is
pretty
mild
in
many
respects
a
little
less
bold
in
flavor
than
the
boston
lager
very
light
pumpkin
flavoringaftertaste
overall
not
a
bad
beer
good
for
sensitive
palates
and
lightweights
honestly
not
a
bad
overall
beer
the
spices
definitely
do
cancel
out
most
of
the
pumpkin
flavor
whatever
pumpkin
flavor
there
is
its
pretty
mild
that
said
it
is
refreshing
quite
drinkable
and
has
a
good
taste
overall
o
very
interesting
beer
that
reflects
the
fall
season
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
massive
squash
flavor
but
the
smell
is
amazing
probably
would
not
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
but
it
was
an
interesting
try
my
first
pumpkin
beer
3
55
best
pumpkin
beer
decent
pumpkin
flavor
shocktop
and
terrapin
do
a
much
better
job
honestly
one
of
these
days
im
going
to
taste
a
pumpkin
beer
that
satisfies
my
pumpkin
beer
craving
until
that
day
sam
adams
does
a
mediocre
job
here
with
that
creepy
cheap
aftertaste
and
falseness
that
is
all
too
often
present
in
this
style
i
will
grab
a
six
of
this
again
it
isnt
my
all
time
fav
but
the
folks
up
in
boston
got
this
one
right
this
pumpkin
ale
is
very
easily
the
best
beer
of
the
2014
collection
it
pours
a
gorgeous
deep
orangeamber
kind
of
hazy
smells
like
pure
pumpkin
pieallspice
and
hints
of
cinnamon
taste
is
exacrtly
the
same
pumpkin
pie
just
amazing
shame
there
were
only
2
in
the
pack
and
im
surprised
at
the
low
ratings
if
you
like
pumpkin
pie
youll
love
this
beer
not
overly
spiced
like
some
pumpkin
beers
but
maybe
a
little
thin
an
ok
beer
but
not
setting
the
world
on
fire
either
good
beer
for
the
price
and
a
good
transition
beer
for
the
bmc
crowd
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
that
shows
some
restraint
imo
most
pumpkin
ales
are
over
spiced
this
one
is
subtly
spiced
which
lets
the
pumpkin
come
through
pours
a
pretty
orangebrown
in
color
with
almost
a
1finger
offwhite
head
left
some
lacing
when
sipped
the
aroma
was
very
pleasant
of
pumpkin
grain
and
spice
the
taste
would
be
the
same
and
very
easy
to
drink
good
carbonation
for
this
type
of
brew
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
aftertaste
overall
i
liked
it
bring
on
autumn
the
beer
pours
in
the
glass
with
some
nice
head
and
it
smells
of
pumpkin
pie
the
taste
of
it
is
like
drinking
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
and
it
is
such
a
great
representative
of
the
style
i
look
forward
to
this
every
fall
samuel
adams
harvest
pumpkin
ale
brewed
by
boston
beer
company
samuel
adams
with
an
abv
of
0f
5
7
this
brew
pours
out
a
light
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
rich
with
sweetness
and
grains
there
is
nothing
overpowering
about
this
brew
so
far
the
taste
is
smooth
like
pumpkin
pie
you
get
the
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
taste
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
brew
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
this
brew
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
with
a
smooth
aftertaste
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
i
would
get
this
brew
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
great
price
point
and
availability
there
is
a
familiar
malt
bill
and
light
yeast
that
is
particular
to
sam
adams
brews
present
here
and
is
somewhat
complimentary
to
the
pumpkin
spices
here
sure
there
is
better
but
i
feel
this
is
a
decent
representative
of
the
style
o
good
i
wasnt
excited
about
this
beer
it
was
in
a
fall
sampler
but
it
wound
up
being
a
nice
surprise
the
best
description
for
this
beer
is
its
name
pumpkin
ale
it
tastes
like
an
ale
injected
with
pumpkin
juice
taste
is
toasty
definite
light
roasted
pumpkin
very
faint
hint
of
spices
nice
toasty
finish
slightly
sweet
up
front
drier
pumpkin
element
in
finish
o
overall
i
like
how
they
opted
to
go
the
more
natural
route
where
the
natural
pumpkin
and
toasted
quality
gets
a
better
representation
then
most
examples
which
tries
to
come
off
like
a
richly
spiced
bomb
pumpkin
pie
decent
with
a
better
then
average
rate
of
drinkability
per
style
i
love
pumpkin
beer
so
this
was
one
i
was
very
excited
to
try
you
can
taste
the
fact
that
it
is
brewed
with
real
pumpkin
instead
of
just
pumpkin
spices
added
into
the
beer
you
can
taste
nutmeg
very
strong
with
the
pumpkin
they
go
together
perfectly
overall
an
enjoyable
offering
that
is
pleasurable
on
a
cold
fall
day
yet
another
good
offering
from
the
king
of
the
microbrewers
but
can
you
really
say
theyre
a
microbrewery
anymore
anyway
love
the
seasonal
offering
great
darkamber
caramel
color
a
burnt
tinge
to
it
that
is
very
appealing
to
the
eyes
not
much
of
a
head
or
lacing
though
great
smell
of
pumpkin
not
overpowering
and
mixes
well
with
the
malts
they
use
mouthfeel
is
decent
not
too
big
into
something
that
is
too
carbonated
so
i
scored
it
lower
there
the
taste
is
outstanding
i
love
it
when
i
can
taste
what
i
smell
in
the
beer
the
pumpkin
mixes
well
with
the
ale
flavor
of
the
recipe
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
one
i
will
be
enjoying
again
soon
this
is
okay
probably
the
most
bland
of
the
pumpkin
brews
ive
tried
it
looks
great
well
its
just
about
like
the
boston
lager
the
smell
is
certainly
inviting
with
the
spices
the
taste
is
simply
lackluster
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
overall
a
well
balanced
beer
that
has
all
the
necessary
ingredients
and
flavors
needed
for
the
style
my
only
gripe
is
the
light
body
this
would
improve
with
a
bit
more
malt
complexity
and
mouthfeel
like
many
of
sam
adams
beers
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
doesnt
take
any
risks
overall
definitely
not
my
favorite
fall
beer
there
is
not
a
ton
a
pumpkin
flavor
and
it
overrun
by
the
spices
i
would
not
go
looking
for
it
overall
this
is
a
great
fall
beer
definitely
goes
well
with
thanksgiving
as
well
solid
beer
sam
adams
harvest
pumpkin
ale
has
the
subtle
smell
of
a
classic
pumpkin
pie
however
the
smell
is
the
most
pumpkiny
aspect
of
this
fall
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
a
harvest
style
beer
then
you
are
in
luck
with
traditional
autumnal
spices
such
as
warming
cinnamon
cloves
and
nutmeg
this
beer
embraces
the
classic
flavors
of
the
american
harvest
season
although
you
can
definitely
taste
hints
of
pumpkin
flavor
it
is
by
no
means
a
pumpkin
beer
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
subtle
at
best
and
does
not
necessarily
fit
its
namesake
as
a
harvest
pumpkin
ale
the
beers
mouthfeel
is
an
average
experience
combining
a
mediumhigh
carbonation
with
a
style
that
is
better
fitted
by
lower
level
of
carbonation
one
additional
positive
note
is
the
beers
dark
amber
coloring
that
pairs
well
with
the
backdrop
of
the
seasons
falling
leaves
overall
this
was
a
good
harvest
beer
there
was
nothing
particularly
exceptional
but
also
not
much
about
which
to
complain
i
found
this
beer
to
have
a
high
drinkability
factor
and
would
recommend
sam
adams
harvest
pumpkin
ale
to
any
casual
beer
drinker
in
search
of
a
seasonal
harvest
brew
sam
adamss
harvest
pumpkin
ale
certainly
does
not
hold
back
on
the
spices
if
you
enjoy
lots
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
notes
in
your
beer
you
should
definitely
give
this
a
try
samuel
adams
harvest
pumpkin
is
another
great
fall
flavored
beer
from
the
boston
brewing
company
its
a
beautiful
brownish
red
color
that
goes
down
smooth
with
a
burst
of
fall
flavors
pumpkin
being
the
star
very
slight
taste
of
hop
but
sweet
pumpkin
is
the
star
of
this
ale
very
much
enjoyed
drinking
5
or
6
while
watching
a
game
of
football
overall
i
was
anticipating
more
pumpkin
character
not
a
bad
flavor
but
this
beer
didnt
deliver
the
autumnal
feeling
the
bottle
promised
another
very
solid
seasonal
brew
from
our
native
boy
samuel
adams
good
pumpkin
aroma
and
nice
orangey
color
really
par
for
the
course
with
most
good
pumpkin
ales
decently
viscous
which
gives
you
a
good
thick
mouthful
of
beer
to
really
get
that
pumpkin
essence
nice
balance
of
spice
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
that
really
takes
this
beer
to
the
4
0
outstanding
level
not
my
all
time
favorite
pumpkin
see
my
reviews
on
my
local
crossroads
brewing
company
of
athens
ny
dr
loomis
pumkin
ale
and
of
course
southern
tier
pumpking
but
very
very
good
overall
for
the
price
8
99
a
sixer
at
the
local
beer
world
probably
one
of
the
best
in
that
category
if
you
like
fall
pumpkin
ales
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
however
you
may
have
notice
there
is
no
reference
to
it
anywhere
above
i
didnt
detect
any
all
the
other
makings
for
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
are
here
in
taste
alone
the
aroma
was
a
big
disappointment
but
other
than
that
its
a
decent
beer
my
pour
was
too
much
for
the
glass
and
i
got
a
little
bit
of
overpour
as
the
result
allowing
it
to
calm
i
got
two
dense
fingers
of
thick
tawny
head
with
great
retention
as
it
slowly
fell
i
was
left
with
great
lacing
color
was
a
deep
mahogany
srm
27
34
with
neplus
quality
clarity
they
must
have
filtered
the
bejeezus
out
of
the
beer
to
get
it
this
bright
i
could
see
into
my
future
and
it
was
my
50th
birthday
party
in
lincoln
ne
with
val
midwest
for
her
21st
nose
smelled
like
what
the
brewdogs
boys
tried
to
make
in
philly
molasses
cinnamon
spruce
tips
pumpkin
this
was
a
revolutionaryera
beer
if
i
ever
smelled
one
the
mouthfeel
was
big
creamy
and
full
the
taste
was
beautiful
some
malt
some
pumpkin
some
spice
some
caramel
it
was
like
candy
but
not
in
a
bad
way
leave
it
to
brewer
bob
and
the
boys
to
nail
it
i
think
that
i
have
hit
upon
a
new
favorite
finish
was
semisweet
allowing
me
to
savor
the
flavors
without
getting
overwhelmed
with
sweetness
which
is
where
a
lot
of
pumpkin
ales
leave
me
high
and
dry
i
now
want
to
do
a
sidebyside
with
pumking
which
was
my
previous
1
overall
a
good
beer
with
out
being
too
strongly
pumpkin
flavored
however
the
high
amount
of
carbonation
didnt
really
fit
in
with
the
style
of
the
beer
worth
a
try
o
sam
adams
created
a
great
tasting
well
balanced
pumpkin
beer
thats
refreshing
and
didnt
go
overkill
on
the
spices
i
think
thats
great
since
i
dont
want
to
smell
liquid
potpourri
in
my
glass
nor
drink
a
spice
rack
another
great
selection
to
enjoy
for
the
autumn
season
from
boston
as
the
temperatures
start
to
drop
and
the
colors
of
the
leaves
start
to
change
its
pumpkin
season
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
have
again
just
not
as
good
as
other
offerings
o
the
taste
of
this
beer
isnt
overly
complex
but
it
has
nice
flavors
of
pumpkin
pie
and
isnt
overly
sweet
overall
impression
a
spicy
easy
drinking
brown
ale
the
spices
seem
kind
of
disjointed
and
nothing
jumps
out
at
me
and
says
pumpkin
but
maybe
thats
ok
appropriate
for
the
season
o
its
okay
i
guess
but
its
also
boring
and
hard
to
drink
two
qualities
which
never
go
together
put
in
the
large
pile
of
bland
notverygood
pumpkin
ales
while
i
stick
with
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
kthx
at
least
its
better
than
i
initially
thought
it
to
be
course
i
initially
thought
it
to
be
horrid
instead
of
just
boring
back
then
o
tasty
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
and
i
would
highly
recommend
considering
the
good
price
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
far
from
the
worst
this
started
off
good
but
quickly
transformed
into
a
generic
sweet
liquid
the
carbonation
was
ample
at
the
start
which
faded
as
did
the
spices
and
pumpkin
which
ultimately
lead
to
a
thin
sweet
malt
bomb
i
expected
more
from
sam
adams
if
you
drink
this
beer
make
sure
it
is
ice
cold
dont
let
this
sucker
warm
up
12
ounce
bottle
into
signature
pint

best
before

pours
fairly
crystal
clear
ruby
copper
color
with
a
12
finger
fairly
dense
light
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
spotty
foamy
lacing
clings
on
the

with
a

amount
of
streaming
carbonation
aromas

nice
and

with

on
the

for
a

and

flavors
with
decent
robustness
and
no
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
smooth
and
moderately
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
good
all
around
balance
of
malt
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
o
this
is
a
pretty
average
pumpkin
ale
nothing
overly
interesting
and
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
one
easy
enough
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
it
feels
like
everything
is
done
rather
conservatively
the
verdict
its
ok
pumpkin
pie
lovers
should
like
it
but
i
prefer
a
more
subtle
pumpkin
flavor
in
my
ales
all
depends
on
your
individual
tastes
this
is
a
pretty
standard
pumpkin
ale
not
bad
but
nothing
special
kind
of
boring
i
always
feel
that
sam
adams
is
rather
over
rated
this
pretty
much
fits
that
bill
it
was
a
decent
beer
and
i
dont
dislike
it
however
i
had
two
the
pumpkin
beers
that
were
much
much
better
so
if
youre
not
feeling
adventurous
but
want
a
light
pumpkin
flavor
drink
this
the
color
is
a
fantastic
dark
hue
though
but
i
really
prefer
to

not

taste
is
ok
but
kinda
heavy
with
not
much
pumpkin
coming
through
its
ok
but
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
again
first
pumpkin
beer
of
the
season
and
it
has
that
traditional
pumpkin
pie
smell
and
flavor
a
little
bit
of
actual
squash
flavor
is
there
because
well
they
actually
put
some
pumpkin
in
the
beer
not
overly
spiced
like
some
pumpkin
beers
that
ive
tried
in
the
past
i
could
say
its
too
vegetal
tasting
but
its
pumpkin
beer
and
authentic
pumpkin
beer
made
with
real
pumpkins
is
going
to
have
that
flavor
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
it
seems
like
sacrilege
not
to
have
at
least
one
pumpkin
beer
when
in
the
fall
o
what
a
delicious
satisfying
and
robust
brew
i
enjoyed
every
sip
moderate
to
dark
amber
color

right
out

this

cant
tell
from
the

its

to
say
about
this

not

o
once
again
samuel
adams
impresses
me
the
pumpkin
isnt
overpowering
nor
is
this
too
sweet
a
good
solid
pumpkin
beer
though
i
couldnt
have
more
than
2
in
one
sitting
o
over
all
it
was
alright
too
carbonated
to
my
taste
and
the
pumpkin
flavor
was
too
faint
for
it
to
strike
me
as
unique
but
it
wasnt
horrendous
this
brew
sucked
me
in
on
the
end
of
an
aisle
at
the
local
super
mercado
as
sams
never
fails
to
please
i
decided
to
roll
the
dice
on
an
autumn
classic
so
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
waft
of
cinnamon
and
spice
and
everything
nice
including
a
hint
of
clove
and
some
maltiness
appropriately
pouring
into
a
sapp
this
brew
partakes
a
deep
bronze
with
a
very
thick
tan
head
looking
much
like
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
on
the
sip
the
spices
are
very
prominent
jumping
out
on
the
initial
taste
then
fading
back
to
give
way
to
very
classic
slightly
bitter
cinnamon
pumpkin
pie
crust
flavor
units
is
a
very
deep
flavored
almost
warming
brew
maybe
a
bit
early
to
be
imbibing
as
it
would
serve
well
when
the
mercury
drops
sab
puts
out
yet
another
fine
selection
drinkability
this
is
one
id
drink
again
it
is
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
others
that
you
can
findschlafly
esp
but
for
what
it
is
im
definitely
happy
with
this
beer
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
the
price
is
right
on
it
and
the
availability
is
great
too
usually
not
a
big
sam
adams
guy
but
this
one
works
for
me
if
you
like
pumpkin
beer
or
sam
overall
get
some
you
wont
be
dissappointed
the
taste
is
good
with
mild
malt
fullness
supporting
an
allspicelike
pepper
and
cinnamon
flavor
up
front
with
more
caramel
malt
flavors
in
the
middle
and
light
vegetal
taste
with
subtle
yeast
and
tangy
nutmeglike
spice
toward
the
back
end
the
overall
take
is
this
is
substantially
spiced
and
mostly
malty
but
not
overboard
in
either
sense
a
pretty
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
not
the
best
there
is
featured
in
the
harvest
collection
12pack
this
pumpkin
ale
boasts
17
pounds
of
pumpkin
per
barrel
per
the
labeling
but
the
flavors
just
dont
add
up
here
spices
are
a
bit
overwhelming
and
pumpkin
flavor
is
a
bit
underwhelming
although
things
are
more
balanced
in
the
smell
than
taste
there
are
also
flavors
of
caramel
and
hops
but
the
nutmegcinnamonbrown
sugar
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
all
of
the
spices
unfortunately
present
the
backbone
of
this
underachieving
pumpkin
ale
a
decent
beer
but
its
not
sam
adams
quality
atmosphere
is
decent
fair
head
but
no
real
lacing
nose
pumpkin
pie
earthy
and
gritty
fall
spices
and
little
of
the
namesake
pumpkin
a
bit
pungent
in
the
end
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
o
the
beer
is
much
more
robust
than
last
years
version
of
pumpkin
harvest
it
says
on
the
bottle
that
they
add
17
pounds
of
pumpkin
per
barrel
and
you
sure
get
that
flavor
to
be
honest
i
would
have
liked
it
better
if
it
was
more
of
a
pumpkin
pie
flavor
rather
than
just
pumpkin
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
but
i
do
like
other
pumpkin
ales
better
i
just
tried
this
as
part
of
a
seasonal
sample
pack
i
have
had
pumpkin
beer
before
at
the
great
dane
some
years
ago
this
has
a
great
dark
caramel
color
and
low
carbonation
the
aroma
is
subtle
yet
pleasing
it
is
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
very
malty
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
spice
not
bad
overall
but
i
would
not
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
overall
its
a
clean
tasty
pumpkin
beer
with
need
of
some
heartier
characteristics
remarks

too
light
and
thin
for
an
ale
with
no
finish
nothing
doing
but
the
vague
pumkiness
a
spiced
ale
for
lager
drinkers
disappointment
o
a
good
representation
of
the
style
o
same
old
same
old
a
pumpkin
ale
is
never
what
i
hoped
when
i
think
of
a
pumpkin
ale
i
think
of
creamy
pumpkin
pie
yet
all
i
ever
get
is
pumpkin
water
drenched
in
the
same
played
out
spices
designed
to
fool
us
that
we
in
fact
have
a
holiday
pumpkin
ale
this
brew
isnt
bad
its
just
generic
taste
is
a
real
downer
kinda
bitter
kinda
bland
and
just
really
not
what
i
was
looking
for
odd
since
i
actually
really
liked
the
smell
overall
more
maltcentric
than
pumpkin
better
than
the
overly
spiced
versions
of
the
style
but
pretty
subtle
for
a
pumpkin
beer
good
malt
character
o
a
very
approachable
beer
that
sacrifices
flavor
for
broad
appeal
about
what
i
expected
i
suppose
regardless
its
something
i
could
drink
again
but
would
not
seek
out
poured
from

a

color
with
a
thick
creamcolored
pillowy
head
the
nose
is
a
mixture
of
sweet

malts
and
spices
cinnamon
cloves
and
allspice
the
taste
follows
suit
with
the
spices
coming
to
the
forefront
and
the
beer
being
well
balanced
even
to
the
point
of
slightly
bitter
on
the
finish
as
opposed
to
most
pumpkin
ales
that
seem
to
lean
more
to
the
sweeter
side
of
the
spectrum
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
minimally
active
carbonation
and
slightly
dry
finish
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
that
being
said
there
are
many
better
ones
out
there
too
tickles
the
pumpkin
beer
itch
but
thats
about
it
overall
this
is
a
good
not
great
pumpkin
beer
very
heavy
on
spice
and
a
bit
too
flat
for
my
liking
one
positive
is
that
it
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
you
can
easily
put
down
two
or
three
without
tiring
of
the
novelty
of
the
seasonal
taste
o
a
well
crafted
pumpkin
harvest
seasonal
brew
id
definitely
drink
another
overall
a
very
good
beer
by
sam
adams
normally
im
not
a
huge
fan
in
my
opinion
it
has
just
the
right
amount
of
pumpkin
coming
through
i
find
that
most
of
the
pumpkin
ales
i
try
are
either
overbearing
or
too
lite
taste
is
decent
like
liquid
pumpkin
pie
with
malts
there
is
also
a
hint
of
what
tastes
like
spiced
chai
tea
i
was
expecting
more
pumpkin
taste
considering
the
bottle
claims
they
use
17lbs
per
barrel
overall
it
is
not
bad
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
well
pass
o
not
my
favorite
seasonal
this
fall
the
smell
was
exciting
but
the
taste
let
me
down
smells
and
tastes
of
the
expected
pumpkin
pie
spicing
with
decent
amounts
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
without
being
overbearing
to
the
toasted
and
caramel
malts
the
difference
between
this
pumpkin
beer
and
a
lot
of
the
other
ones
on
the
market
seems
to
be
a
sharp
accent
of
powdered
dried
ginger
in
the
midsip
and
a
touch
of
white
pepper
dust
its
somewhat
better
than
the
average
pumpkin
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
point
smell
reminds
me
of
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
just
like
the
smellmalty
and
sweet
with
a
spicy
pumpkin
background
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
little
carbonation
compared
to
other
pumpkin
ales
this
one
has
a
much
stronger
pumpkin
flavor
overall
an
excellent
seasonal
beer
from
samuel
adams
and
one
that
i
will
be
returning
to
worth
a
try
for
a
sample
night
but
probably
not
good
for
more
than
two
pours
a
deep
copper
color
notes
of
pumpkin
and
light
spices
on
the
nose
taste
follows
overall
its
a
very
mild
profile
not
bad
but
not
really
pronounced
in
any
way
the
spice
is
still
there
and
there
is
a
malty
smoothness
in
there
too
i
like
it
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
when
i
could
get
something
like
punkin
or
even
sam
adams
own
fat
jack
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
creamy
tan
head
aromas
of
plums
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
taste
begins
with
a
nutmeg
and
vanilla
beginning
followed
by
some
cinnamon
a
little
bit
of
whole
wheat
bread
and
an
earthy
slightly
tangy
finish
mouthfeel
is
relatively
full
overall
pretty
good
tastes
a
bit
like
a
pumpkin
homebrew
i
made
last
year
o
way
better
than
i
anticipated
i
must
say
if
this
beer
was
a
bit
closer
to
the
syrupy
end
this
would
be
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
brews
that
aside
this
beer
is
a
great
showing
overall
this
isnt
offensive
but
it
feel
like
a
pumpkin
spice
ale
instead
of
just
pumpkin
its
a
bit
too
spiced
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
generic
definitely
nothing
wrong
with
going
through
a
sixer
but
there
are
some
better
ones
out
there
as
well
this
is
a
pretty
mediocre
pumpkin
beer
i
couldnt
really
move
past
the
cough
syrup
component
and
the
general
lack
of
pumpkin
is
disappointing
pours

brownish
hue

some
moderate

on

the

with
nice

and
good

better
then
i
had
expected
with
good
level

and
really
smooth
aftertaste
o
i
think
this
brew
might
be
a
good
intro
for
folks
a
little
bit
skeptical
of
the
idea
of
a
pumpkin
beer
glad
to
recommend
overall
i
find
this
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
nothing
to
be
upset
over
either
i
did
believe
the
malts
overpowered
the
pumpkin
and
spices
a
little
which
i
would
have
preferred
to
be
a
little
less
subtle
overall
this
is
the
definition
of
a
pumpkin
ale
not
sweet
just
pumpkin
with
malts
and
hops
at
least
thats
what
i
think
pours
a
brownishcopper
with
a
finger
of
head
that
dissipated
quickly
but
left
a
trace
of
lacing
subtle
pumpkin
notes
are
present
in
the
nose
but
there
is
also
an
astringent
scent
as
well
subtle
sweetness
is
certainly
present
in
the
taste
some
of
that
is
due
to
the
pumpkins
but
the
malt
profile
also
clearly
adds
to
the
sweetness
m
light
bodied
good
carbonation
o
i
was
excited
to
try
this
and
expected
great
things
its
a
good
pumpkin
beer
than
has
all
the
flavors
expected
but
has
no
bang
to
it
probably
not
on
my
top
list
but
a
decent
take
on
the
style
overallnot
a
bad
brew
at
all
it
is
extremely
tasty
and
well
crafted
i
honestly
prefer
imperial
pumpkin
over
any
regular
pumpkin
ale
but
this
one
is
just
borderline
considering
price
and
how
easy
to
find
it
might
end
up
on
the
top
when
it
comes
to
pumpkins
salud
o
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
batch
or
what
but
this
honestly
did
not
even
taste
like
a
beer
it
felt
like
drinking
sparkling
water
im
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
and
ive
tried
several
varieties
but
this
was
by
far
the
most
disappointing
offering
ive
tried
to
date
i
might
give
it
another
go
to
see
if
it
really
was
just
a
fluke
but
i
do
so
hesitantly
based
on
this
first
taste
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
above
average
pumpkin
ale
which
to
me
is
typically
of
most
everything
from
sam
adams
their
beers
are
really
really
good
just
not
great
exactly
how
i
feel
about
this
pumpkin
technically
its
splendid
the
spices
werent
overwhelming
and
they
paired
with
the
pumpkin
flavor
perfectly
no
overwhelming
bitterness
nor
maltiness
well
balanced
easily
drinkable
i
guess
i
always
feel
sam
could
do
just
a
tiny
bit
better
but
still
a
very
very
good
pumpkin
ale
one
i
could
drink
each
fall
season
do
the
caramel
malt
backbone
makes
this
more
than
just
a
1trick
pony
id
gladly
have
another
definitely
drinkable
and
certainly
repeatable
decent
take
on
the
style
moderately
flavorful
moderate
sweetness
not
cloying
viscosity
make
this
more
of
a
sippernight
capper
kind
of
fallwinter
offering
overall
not
a
bad
pumpkin
brew
it
is
on
the
roastier
side
more
toward
the
end
of
the
taste
but
it
has
a
nice
level
of
sweetness
to
balance
the
pumpkin
and
spice
it
has
a
very
nice
mouthfeel
and
is
quite
easy
to
drink
not
too
shabby
pours
a
bright
clear
dark
red
with
a
moderate
sized
head
nice
pumpkin
pie
aroma
but
not
overpowering
taste
has
a
definite
pumpkin
character
toasted
malt
and
a
little
spice
but
again
not
too
much
which
is
good
there
is
just
a
touch
of
tartness
too
which
im
not
sure
if
i
like
or
not
medium
bodied
easily
drinkable
overall
this
not
fantastic
but
it
is
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
because
it
was
the
closest
one
pours
a
rich
reddish
brown
with
fluffy
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
leaving
behind
a
nice
lacey
ring
smell
is
of
pumpkin
meat
and
spice
mouthfeel
is
rather
thick
wet
and
refreshing
it
felt
chewy
cinnamon
bread
notes
and
a
plum
finish
make
this
a
sweet
dessert
beer
very
malty
with
little
hop
presence
it
hit
the
spot
and
left
me
satisfied
it
is
nothing
like
other
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
with
dogfish
still
holding
the
number
one
slot
in
that
specific
endeavor
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
opretty
decent
beer
pumpkin
isnt
over
the
top
but
still
enjoyable
beer
overall
its
a
bit
of
an
odd
flavored
pumpkin
beer
really
heavy
in
the
spices
with
an
somewhat
awkward
pumpkin
flavor
o
just
not
a
fan
worst
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
to
date
hope
they
reformulate
for
next
year
o
a
real
easy
drinker
and
a
fairly
flavorful
one
at
that
excessive
spicing
but
decent
base
flavors
one
of
those
beers
that
you
think
this
isnt
that
great
rjt
it
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
it
even
had
a
creamy
texture
low
carbonation
i
dont
really
like
it
but
if
you
like
pumpkin
pie
beer
this
beer
is
perfect
there
is
a
chewy
caramel
malt
backbone
i
detect
some
classic
fall
flavors
in
this
beer
cinnamon
all
spice
pumpkin
and
black
pepper
the
pumpkin
flavors
become
more
prevalent
with
each
sip
and
i
appreciate
that
there
is
a
nice
mini
hop
snap
on
the
finish
overall
another
great
addition
to
the
sam
adams
family
and
one
i
like
much
better
than
their
oktoberfest
which
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
a
great
fall
session
beer
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
pumpkin
beer
its
maybe
not
as
flavorful
as
some
other
offerings
that
ive
had
due
to
the
lower
amount
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
but
it
certainly
retains
a
lot
of
the
malt
characteristics
of
the
base
beer
its
pretty
tasty
overall
and
very
drinkable
overall
not
impressed
it
needs
more
sweetness
to
balance
the
allspice
in
my
opinion
or
maybe
some
wheat
or
more
biscuit
o
solid
pumpkin
beer
flavors
are
there
could
use
just
a
little
more
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
all
of
the
taste
is
very
subtle
and
not
as
powerful
as
i
would
have
liked
its
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
on
the
market
o
not
too
bad
but
not
their
best
maybe
if
the
spicing
was
dialed
back
a
little
bit
i
would
rate
it
higher
still
very
drinkable
but
its
a
novelty
from
notes
9
9
12
it
is
what
it
is
if
you
dig
the
style
youll
likely
dig
this
one
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
taste
of
pumpkin
so
the
fact
that
it
wasnt
the
dominate
flavor
here
was
a
plus
for
me
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
fall
the
spice
blend
is
fitting
for
this
time
of
year
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
overall
a
fairly
disappointing
beer
from
the
harvest
collection
it
tastes
pretty
good
but
the
feel
look
and
smell
are
lacking
leaving
this
as
yet
another
average
sam
adams
beer
in
my
opinion
still
wouldnt
mind
throwing
back
a
few
for
fall
o
i
remember
enjoying
this
beer
many
times
several
years
back
but
now
im
just
not
really
into
it
like
many
others
have
said
there
seems
to
be
too
much
spice
and
not
enough
pumpkin
and
the
spices
that
are
there
seem
off
and
a
bit
artificial
theres
quite
a
few
sam
adams
beers
that
i
enjoy
going
back
to
but
this
one
wont
make
that
list
and
needs
quite
a
bit
of
tweaking
in
my
opinion
m
medium
bodied
mild
carbonation
semidry
finish
overall
a
fairly
standard
if
slightly
better
than
average
pumpkin
ale
a
decent
fall
seasonal
and
a
great
member
of
sam
adamss
lineup
odnot
my
favorite
pump
hard
to
really
deliver
with
this
style
i
also
really
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
style
wont
be
grabbing
a
seder
of
this
any
autumn
in
the
near
future
this
one
struck
me
off
the
bat
with
the
perfect
amber
color
better
head
and
lacing
and
its
a
5
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
pumpkin
which
is
more
like
fresh
pumpkin
as
oppose
to
pumpkin
flavoring
which
is
usually
sweeter
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
the
flavor
starts
with
caramel
malts
and
some
pumpkin
but
it
quickly
sours
to
a
fresh
pumpkin
flavor
without
out
much
sweetness
or
spice
about
what
i
expected
not
having
this
one
again
for
me
pumpkin
ales
are
a
novelty
to
enjoy
one
or
two
of
in
the
fall
and
thats
it
still
sam
adams
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
examples
ive
come
across
not
too
shabby
at
all
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
beautiful
coloring
and
the
even
taste
throughout
the
coloring
just
screams
autumn
the
colors
were
deep
and
the
head
was
frothy
and
inviting
the
flavoring
showed
nice
pumpkin
with
a
deep
malt
background
of
butter
and
caramel
without
becoming
too
cheap
tasting
as
some
sam
adams
beers
tend
to
do
serving
type
bottle
o
a
tasty
beverage
great
style
for
mix
pack
as
several
in
row
would
be
less
enjoyable
but
this
is
recommended
for
all
pumpkin
fans
o
i
rather
enjoyed
samuel
adams
seasonal
pumpkin
offering
although
a
rather
tried
and
true
style
bbc
just
got
it
right
with
this
one
in
creating
a
superbly
drinkable
and
well
flavored
seasonal
if
youre
not
big
on
the
whole
got
to
have
a
pumpkin
beer
in
the
fall
thing
you
might
want
to
try
this
one
its
not
overbearing
and
doesnt
bring
any
bad
tastes
along
with
it
overall
drinkability
most
of
sams
experiments
usually
show
some
sort
of
promise
even
if
they
are
not
my
favorite
this
ones
not
good
though
stick
to
their
octoberfest
o
an
easy
drinking
modest
but
tasty
example
of
the
pumpkin
ale
style
not
as
spiced
and
aggressive
as
many
of
the
most
popular
examples
but
a
clean
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
note
that
this
was
consumed
at
cellar
temperature
which
greatly
increased
the
mouthfeel
and
enjoyability
of
this
beer
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
all
the
time
but
its
a
great
beer
o
this
beer
could
pair
well
with
thankgiving
fare
i
would
have
liked
to
taste
more
pumpkin
the
spices
make
it
a
one
and
done
but
its
good
to
drink
on
a
brisk
fall
evening
o
ive
been
avoiding
sa
for
some
time
now
but
in
all
honesty
they
put
out
some
decently
drinkable
stuff
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
mess
but
its
actually
kind
of
enjoyable
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
it
still
has
a
decent
flavor
and
aroma
profile
o
quite
let
down
given
that
this
beer
was
the
main
reason
i
bought
this
pack
spices
dominate
the
finish
with
a
good
kick
but
not
too
much
i
really
like
this
beer
overall
it
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
it
smells
but
it
also
remains
fairly
drinkable
by
not
being
too
in
your
face
i
could
actually
drink
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
medium
body
which
thins
out
on
the
finish
clove
and
nutmeg
touch
of
cinnamon
and
vanilla
no
true
pumpkin
taste
but
thats
probably
because
its
not
made
with
this
years
pumpkins
tastes
like
pumpkin
beer
light
if
youre
going
for
a
session
pumpkin
ale
make
it
a
long
trail
pumpkin
or
a
night
owl
cause
this
one
falls
short
for
being
at
the
same
price
point
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
pours
clear
dark
amber
with
a
tall
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
at
a
moderate
pace
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
rising
in
the
beer
there
are
aromas
of
cinnamon
clove
allspice
and
pumpkin
it
smells
like
pumpkin
bread
those
pumpkin
bread
notes
are
definitely
there
up
front
but
theyre
not
very
strong
theres
the
spiciness
from
the
cinnamon
clove
and
allspice
and
the
pumpkin
flavors
complement
the
malt
very
well
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
serves
as
a
good
introduction
to
this
style
o
a
good
pumpkin
beer
a
great
first
pumpkin
beer
o
i
am
disappointed
by
this
brew
i
always
love
fall
seasonal
beer
even
though
most
of
them
are
not
great
i
would
go
for
sam
adams
octoberfest
over
the
pumpkin
harvest
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
i
think
this
beer
would
go
well
with
some
soft
rock
fleetwood
mac
rumours
or
some
wilco
o
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
and
always
enjoy
a
glass
of
this
during
the
fall
o
hard
to
call
this
one
a
pumpkin
beer
its
more
of
a
light
spiced
ale
meant
for
the
fall
season
seems
like
its
only
up
from
here
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
are
concerned
looks
great
smells
great
tastes
a
little
bland
a
fairly
average
pumpkin
ale
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
not
very
memorable
would
have
again
but
would
prefer
a
number
of
other
pumpkin
ales
first
i
like
their
fat
jack
a
little
better
overall
i
liked
this
brew
i
know
there
are
much
better
fall
seasonals
out
there
much
better
pumpkin
ales
etc
but
this
is
a
good
offering
from
bbcsa
and
i
really
like
i
would
recommend
it
to
all
even
those
not
necessarily
in
the
craft
beer
scene
its
a
solid
fall
beer
o
hard
to
call
this
one
a
pumpkin
beer
its
more
of
a
light
spiced
ale
meant
for
the
fall
season
seems
like
its
only
up
from
here
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
are
concerned
o
slightly
above
average
but
really
doesnt
earn
the
right
to
be
called
a
pumpkin
beer
tastes
like
a
red
ale
with
some
spices
shoveled
in
feels
medium
in
body
some
dryness
on
the
palate
but
tasty
altogether
pours
a
dark
copper
tinted
brown
minimal
cap
of
offwhite
head
scent
brings
balance
between
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
toffeelike
malt
sweetness
taste
brings
a
firm
dose
of
allspice
clove
cinnamon
moderate
toffee
and
bready
malts
muted
pumpkin
taste
compared
to
other
aspects
of
taste
small
grassy
and
herbal
hop
presence
medium
bodied
slightly
creamy
solid
pumpkin
ale
heavy
on
the
malt
bill
and
spice
muting
pumpkin
qualities
a
slightly
above
average
pumpkin
ale
probably
wont
get
another
twelve
pack
but
i
will
drink
it
if
its
around
final
thoughts
like
a
lot
of
samuel
adams
beers
their
harvest
pumpkin
ale
looks
great
and
smells
pretty
good
but
comes
up
a
little
short
in
the
actual
drinking
of
it
if
they
toned
down
the
spices
a
bit
and
upped
the
o
g
then
this
one
might
be
a
real
winner
but
for
now
its
just
an
above
average
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
a
cool
autumn
night
around
a
campfire
overall
i
always
look
forward
to
drinking
my
pumpkin
ales
in
the
fall
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
you
could
kind
of
call
it
a
dry
pumpkin
ale
since
it
isnt
very
sweet
overall
its
ok
i
can
deal
with
spicy
beer
id
just
like
more
sweetness
to
balance
but
this
was
lacking
balance
altogether
o
i
think
august
is
too
early
for
this
beer
to
be
released
as
im
sure
i
will
enjoy
this
beer
once
fall
officially
comes
overall
good
seasonal
beer
lots
of
flavor
and
spice
i
could
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
for
sure
overall
each
year
i
have
this
i
like
it
more
i
am
not
sure
if
the
brew
is
changing
or
my
tastes
are
changing
as
the
years
go
by
o
solid
offering
from
sam
adams
while
the
best
pumpkin
beers
on
the
market
pumking
and
punkin
perhaps
at
least
in
the
midwest
are
quite
expensive
i
can
see
myself
picking
this
one
up
a
few
times
throughout
the
season
when
im
feeling
a
pumpkin
beer
already
grabbed
a
sixer
after
tasting
it
in
the
harvest
12
pack
pretty
drinkable
i
had
no
problem
going
through
two
of
these
in
a
night
alongside
various
other
beers
the
harvest
beers
seem
to
come
earlier
every
year
however
im
a
lover
of
pumpkin
beers
when
theyre
well
made
and
couldnt
wait
to
give
this
one
a
try
its
a
chestnut
brown
color
capped
with
an
offwhite
head
good
clarity
the
aroma
is
pumpkin
pie
and
malt
it
smells
like
autumn
modest
hop
scent
and
a
little
toasted
character
sizable
spice
component
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
semidry
which
is
probably
necessary
to
keep
the
beer
balanced
spice
pumpkin
malt
and
a
lowlevel
sweetness
in
the
flavor
the
pie
spices
are
not
overdone
which
is
a
good
thing
in
my
opinion
full
in
body
better
than
most
in
this
style
good
but
not
great
worth
trying
but
not
the
decadent
pumpkin
pie
experience
some
fans
of
the
style
might
be
seeking
to
its
credit
it
is
more
of
a
beer
with
pumpkin
spice
accents
than
liquid
pumpkin
pie
that
happens
to
resemble
beer
again
i
cant
help
wondering
from
previous
reviews
if
this
recipe
has
been
tweaked
for
2012
decent
pumpkin
ale
not
outstanding
has
a
good
smell
taste
is
bland
to
me
at
least
could
be
better
there
are
better
pumpkin
beers
on
the
market
this
offering
is
so
so
smells
good
but
the
taste
is
bland
i
was
expecting
more
would
not
buy
it
unless
the
beer
was
in
a
variety
pack
another
good
quality
with
this
beer
is
the
fact
that
the
flavor
is
more
natural
overall
some
pumpkin
beers
rely
on
artificial
extracts
to
achieve
their
flavor
but
this
one
uses
real
pumpkin
and
it
is
evident
in
the
taste
with
all
things
considered
the
beer
easily
rates
above
average
and
it
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
brews
available
o
again
more
of
a
spiced
beer
than
a
pumpkin
beer
kind
of
a
weird
beer
to
evaluate
while
i
really
enjoyed
the
autumn
spices
i
think
the
beer
could
benefit
from
a
little
more
pumpkin
kick
to
go
with
it
o
a
very
solid
pumpkin
ale
cant
beat
punkin
or
pumpking
but
its
one
of
my
favorite
sold
in
the
six
pack
format
tasty
stuff
for
sure
md
acdcurate
flavors
could
be
one
of
a
number
of
quality
pumpkin
beers
wheres
a
beer
with
actual
pumpkin
fruit
flavor
i
either
like
pumpkin
beers
like
smuttynose
pumpkin
or
dislike
them
like
post
road
imperials
are
a
different
matter
i
like
this
beer
it
is
smooth
and
satisfying
has
pumpkin
flavor
but
isnt
too
overpowering
with
the
spices
definitely
one
i
would
want
to
drink
again
overall
bleh
it
feels
like
im
drinking
a
flat
diet
pumpkin
soda
and
a
bad
one
at
that
ive
had
pumpkin
ales
before
this
is
a
bad
example
for
the
style
all
the
pumpkins
in
the
world
wont
make
the
flavor
come
through
if
you
overkill
it
with
spices
drinkability
deserves
its
own
sixpack
release
the
heck
with
the
harvest
pack
two
bottle
thing
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
heavy
on
the
spices
mostly
nutmeg
and
all
spice
with
a
bit
of
cinnamon
toasted
malt
and
bread
aromas
with
a
light
sweetness
of
toffee
the
flavor
has
a
nice
subtle
vanilla
note
along
with
the
spices
a
little
bit
of
gingerbread
character
to
it
as
well
not
much
actual
pumpkin
to
it
but
a
pretty
decent
beer
anyway
o
its
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
around
highly
drinkable
great
fall
flavors
with
pronounced
spices
typical
of
pumpkin
pie
slight
carbonation
just
enough
for
what
this
beer
needs
would
gladly
have
this
one
again
among
the
better
of
the
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
over
the
years
nice
job
boston
beer
co
after
sipping
it
i
remember
recalling
that
it
was
not
that
great
i
didnt
think
there
was
much
flavor
to
it
at
all
i
thought
that
shipyards
pumpkin
put
this
to
shame
as
i
had
been
drinking
a
lot
of
it
while
in
boston
nothing
stood
out
about
this
pumpkin
simply
average
o
maybe
because
i
had
it
fresh
ontap
that
explains
the
discrepancy
between
my
review
and
some
of
the
more
recent
ones
but
i
thought
this
was
a
nofuss
simple
but
delicious
pumpkin
ale
i
guess
i
should
start
this
review
by
saying
i
dont
really
care
for
pumpkin
beers
that
being
said
this
is
a
somewhat
more
tolerable
offering
color
is
a
nice
dark
amber
with
a
cola
like
head
that
disappeared
just
as
with
cola
smell
is
like
a
spiced
cookie
but
with
this
distracting
smell
like
the
smell
of
salt
when
you
prepare
a
warm
salt
water
gargle
taste
is
that
usual
spicy
after
shave
that
dominates
the
style
i
do
appreciate
the
dryness
in
the
finish
which
helps
to
keep
the
spiciness
from
getting
out
of
hand
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
but
again
i
dont
seek
out
this
style
by
any
brewer
overall
overall
this
was
a
beer
that
was
too
strong
it
had
too
many
spices
making
the
taste
overly
strong
it
did
have
good
color
and
smell
but
with
a
strong
taste
it
was
too
much
for
me
this
was
bad
im
willing
to
give
it
another
try
but
probably
not
for
awhile
this
ale
taste
like
a
yuengling
with
some
pumpkin
spice
mixed
end
ahh
next
pours
the
mest
beautiful
redorange
sunset
haze
uve
ever
seen
fluffy
tan
head
and
a
big
autumn
aromatic
palate
i
smell
pumpkin
pie
filling
clove
and
cinnamon
maybe
even
cardomom
flavor
is
a
bit
too
spiced
for
a
pumpkin
ale
in
my
opinion
but
has
a
nice
seasonal
respectability
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
it
feels
weird
in
the
stomach
maybe
a
combination
of
the
big
malts
and
spice
but
i
wouldnt
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
solid
beer
again
from
sam
but
dont
creaming
myself
over
it
if
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
looked
in
the
glass
thatd
be
another
story
the
beer
poured
with
a
slightly
amber
color
head
compared
with
its
tanamber
body
head
dissipated
quickly
and
very
little
lacing
on
the
sides
the
aromas
include
a
very
slight
roasted
nuts
or
a
burnt
sugar
smell
with
a
dominant
flavoring
of
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
flavors
the
taste
comes
with
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
but
there
is
a
decent
light
pumpkin
with
vanillamalt
flavor
i
did
like
the
mouthfeel
it
had
a
good
balance
between
a
smooth
and
carbonation
overall
not
too
bad
of
a
pumpkin
ale
drinkability
is
great
for
a
pumpkin
ale
very
balanced
beer
but
also
has
a
ton
of
really
good
tastes
to
it
i
really
like
some
of
the
stronger
pumpkin
beers
but
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
more
than
one
of
them
this
beer
has
a
great
pumpkin
taste
without
overpowering
the
tastebuds
a
sessionable
pumpkin
that
refreshes
and
warms
on
an
autumnal
day
overall
not
a
pumpkin
beer
id
come
back
to
like
most
sam
adams
beer
its
passable
o
good
pumpkin
ale
from
sam
adams
id
have
this
one
again
great
combination
of
the
flavors
all
around
the
mouth
has
low
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
slickness
to
coat
the
tongue
i
liked
this
as
change
of
pumpkin
i
t
has
less
spice
and
more
pumpkin
than
normal
examples
overall
decent
but
too
overspiced
and
spices
not
well
balanced
needs
better
flavor
of
pumpkin
pretty
light
easy
to
drink
probably
will
not
buy
again
until
they
redo
the
recipe
for
the
beer
i
rarely
give
one
score
through
every
category
but
this
beer
really
was
on
all
counts
average
it
certainly
didnt
disappoint
but
in
no
way
stood
out
refreshing
pumpkin
taste
without
any
of
the
added
spices
that
usually
make
up
a
pumkin
ale
or
lager
the
beer
stays
true
to
its
form
and
is
genuinly
enjoyable
it
seemed
to
do
better
than
most
pumpkins
on
the
shelves
but
that
is
in
part
due
to
its
name
brand
this
beer
was
the
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
ufc
135
with
it
reminded
me
that
summer
was
over
and
fall
was
already
here
my
tip
hurry
up
and
try
this
beer
before
it
runs
out
like
samuel
adams
dunlekweizen
you
will
be
able
to
find
it
in
your
local
beer
store
not
your
grocery
store
well
im
still
not
a
pumpkin
beer
fan
but
youre
really
not
going
to
do
much
better
than
this
one
its
a
nice
stunning
redorange
color
and
smells
strongly
of
pumpkin
pie
the
taste
is
very
nice
its
got
more
pumpkin
and
less
spices
to
it
than
the
average
pumpkin
ale
which
goes
a
long
way
towards
making
it
actually
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
solid
im
still
not
a
pumpkin
guy
and
wouldnt
have
picked
this
up
if
it
werent
in
the
mix
pack
but
this
is
really
about
as
good
as
far
as
im
concerned
pumpkin
beer
fans
might
think
otherwise
though
overall
a
flavorful
pumpkin
ale
with
just
the
right
amount
of
spices
blended
together
for
a
nice
tasty
experience
its
easy
enough
to
drink
and
all
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
unless
youre
a
huge
pumpkin
freak
but
if
thats
the
case
youll
probably
be
even
less
impressed
with
this
as
youd
probably
had
many
of
the
better
ones
overall
a
good
autumn
brew
drinkabilityoverall
this
to
me
is
definitely
one
of
the
most
drinkable
pumpkin
beers
of
the
year
i
wouldnt
necessarily
compare
it
to
some
of
the
real
big
imperial
pumpkin
beers
but
this
towers
over
those
in
drink
ability
i
would
have
to
say
overall
this
was
probably
the
most
session
able
pumpkin
i
had
this
year
because
it
didnt
knock
you
unconscious
with
spice
good
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
by
feb
12
date
on
the
back
this
pours
a
nice
brownish
color
with
a
large
foamy
tan
head
with
good
retention
the
smells
are
of
pumpkin
spice
and
malts
the
feel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
the
taste
is
sweet
and
pretty
good
i
get
the
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
followed
by
a
nice
slightly
bitter
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
which
ill
get
again
o
im
not
impressed
will
not
be
trying
this
pumpkin
ale
again
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
pours
a
bright
reddish
orange
with
a
one
inch
of
off
white
head
that
drops
to
a
little
film
quickly
smell
pumpkin
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
some
carmel
taste
is
all
of
that
a
nice
amount
of
pumpkin
nice
body
not
very
heavy
more
carbonation
would
help
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
i
cant
think
of
any
good
reason
to
buy
or
drink
this
beer
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
could
use
more
pumpkin
flavor
with
more
assertive
spices
overall
its
an
ok
easily
drinkable
for
the
masses
pumpkin
beer
after
having
pumking
last
week
i
realize
how
mild
and
safe
this
pumpkin
beer
is
to
fit
in
the
larger
beer
market
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
a
good
balance
of
pumpkin
and
spiceand
a
good
representation
of
the
style
its
just
somewhat
lacking
the
kick
im
looking
for
to
categorize
it
as
a
good
pumpkin
ale
as
with
most
sam
adams
brewsa
good
concept
of
what
the
style
isbut
its
pretty
basic
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
anything
pumpkin
and
all
in
all
this
was
pretty
ok
the
pumpkin
flavor
was
pretty
subdued
but
it
was
for
sure
noticeable
throughout
the
beer
it
was
light
and
a
little
crisp
but
didnt
have
a
lot
of
depth
it
couldve
used
an
upgrade
in
the
pumpkin
aspect
of
the
beer
it
is
not
exceptional
the
aroma
is
weak
as
is
the
head
i
certainly
would
drink
it
again
but
there
are
better
i
would
like
to
try
their
double
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
pumpkin
ale
it
had
a
great
nose
the
taste
didnt
really
disappoint
and
the
feel
was
just
about
right
d
a
few
of
these
go
down
real
easy
they
taste
delicious
but
i
feel
too
many
of
these
and
the
sweetness
would
become
overbearing
overall
this
is
a
beer
im
gonna
have
to
stock
up
to
last
me
once
they
stop
selling
it
if
the
spice
wasnt
so
overdone
and
the
pumpkin
came
through
more
i
would
be
a
lot
more
interested
sort
of
a
dissapointment
this
just
isnt
how
i
like
my
pumpkin
beers
to
be
done
with
a
boatload
of
syrupy
sweetness
and
spice
covering
up
a
lot
of
what
should
really
make
this
beer
the
pumpkin
and
even
giving
the
overall
profile
a
bit
of
a
medicinal
feel
i
wont
be
trying
this
one
again
o
not
a
bad
pumpkin
offering
overall
nice
aroma
and
initial
flavor
but
falls
apart
in
the
middle
to
back
end
and
ultimately
disappoints
overall
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
spicy
but
balanced
fairly
well
overall
this
isnt
another
liquid
pumpkin
pie
concoction
it
has
a
malt
complexity
heavy
handed
spice
profile
and
dry
finish
makes
me
want
to
burn
some
leaves
and
chop
some
wood
while
having
a
bonfire
and
then
stoking
up
the
fireplace
in
the
bedroom
to
romance
my
wife
on
a
cool
northern
minnesota
late
october
eve
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
worth
trying
though
there
are
far
superior
pumpkin
beers
on
the
market
not
too
hot
on
this
one
looks
like
an
amberhued
brown
ale
smell
of
very
strong
pumpkin
spices
methinks
a
bit
much
after
a
long
draw
a
slight
fresh
pumpkin
is
picked
up
a
bit
of
graham
crackery
but
then
theres
this
medicinal
boozey
after
taste
that
just
isnt
right
it
along
with
the
spices
linger
in
the
sinuses
fora
while
ill
move
on
from
here
o
drinkable
but
the
overly
intense
spice
isnt
desirable
full
bodied
with
a
blast
of
crisp
zesty
spice
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
sweeter
notes
into
a
slightly
dry
finish
hints
of
pepper
cinnamon
clove
nutmeg
and
ginger
followed
by
a
prominent
pumpkin
presence
as
well
as
some
caramel
and
rye
the
spiciness
slightly
overpowers
the
pumpkin
flavor
but
its
still
pretty
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
o
i
like
this
beer
however
i
think
that
it
could
be
enhanced
and
made
to
be
a
beer
i
love
in
all
this
version
of
this
style
is
relatively
good
it
definitely
is
a
worth
a
try
as
it
is
a
unique
flavor
that
really
brings
out
the
mood
of
fall
perfect
on
a
crisp
fall
day
i
guess
however
i
is
so
sweet
that
you
probably
wont
want
more
than
one
d
very
drinkable
pretty
decent
flavors
but
the
beer
is
far
too
thin
and
watery
and
could
have
used
a
bit
more
carbonation
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
a
pretty
wellrounded
beer
that
seemed
like
a
perfect
fallwinter
beer
id
give
it
another
try
d
promising
appearance
and
aroma
give
way
to
a
rather
average
at
best
pumpkin
ale
in
all
other
categories
there
are
many
pumpkin
ales
to
recommend
over
this
one
boston
beers
foray
into
fall
seasonals
should
stick
with
marzens
notes
not
a
style
that
works
for
me
this
is
my
3rd
pumpkin
ale
and
i
cant
say
its
for
me
this
isnt
bad
per
the
style
though
only
the
mouthfeel
seems
lifeless
i
have
5
more
bottles
of
this
to
get
rid
of
overall
this
is
a
good
fall
beer
and
a
tasty
pumpkin
ale
i
bought
this
variety
pack
at
a
local
wine
and
cheese
outlet
in
richmondil
i
cant
wait
to
taste
the
double
pumkin
ale
id
buy
this
one
again

pumpkin
ale
is
a
crystal
clear
deep
amber
ale
with
a
small
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
blotch
and
leaves
nice

on
the
glass
there
is
spice
wood
and
pumpkin
in
the
nose
with
notes
of
nutmeg
and
vanilla
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
it
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
silty
theres
more
spice
than
pumpkin
here
i
cant
isolate
a
pumpkin
flavor
the
spices
and
the
hops
work
together
well
to
provide
a
moderate
bitterness
it
has
a
good
caramelly
malt
presence
thats
not
too
sweet
theres
good
balance
all
around
its
very
autumny
and

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
one
or
two
with
better
spice
profiles
but
im
glad
i
can
at
least
taste
the
spice
o
good
but
in
a
specialty
category
like
this
one
this
beer
doesnt
shine
past
a
lot
of
the
other
options
available
still
well
made
and
worth
drinking
o
i
guess
the
brew
can
be
classified
under
a
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
but
there
really
isnt
a
pumpkin
experience
that
goes
down
seek
out
pumking
horseheads
pumpkin
ale
or
dfh
for
the
pumpkin
experience
pumpkin
ale
is
certainly
a
popular
creation
during
this
time
of
year
the
great
ones
are
few
while
the
decent
ones
are
many
harvest
pumpkin
ale
falls
into
the
latter
category
its
pretty
good
but
doesnt
really
distinguish
itself
from
the
crowd
its
also
just
a
tad
pumpkin
heavy
a
little
more
balance
among
the
spices
would
go
a
long
way
all
in
all
pretty
good
stuff
if
youre
a
pumpkin
beer
fanatic
its
probably
one
you
should
check
out
o
pretty
decent
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
a
few
better
many
worse
a
good
representation
of
the
fall
season
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
brews
at
the
moment
pours
a
dark
caramel
with
a
snow
white
head
which
was
surprisingly
super
white
the
smell
was
a
nice
mix
of
spices
and
malt
smelled
some
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
the
taste
followed
suit
a
nice
deep
malt
flavor
with
the
mix
of
spices
definitely
pumpkin
the
cinnamon
comes
through
the
most
but
the
spices
are
all
there
this
one
has
a
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
bit
smoother
than
what
i
am
used
to
from
sam
adams
overall
a
good
beer
nice
spice
flavor
not
too
terribly
pumpkin
that
will
overpower
this
is
a
beer
with
intense
spice
and
crust
characters
better
than
average
pumpkin
ale
very
upfront
about
its
spice
and
grain
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than
one
every
few
days
but
a
sixpack
once
a
year
would
be
enjoyable
overall
not
bad
nice
malts
light
on
the
spices
pumpkin
has
fresh
flavor
and
not
a
ton
of
canned
or
artificial
flavors
nice
dry
bready
finish
ive
had
worse
bu
this
is
another
sugar
and
spice
bomb
made
for
the
masses
this
is
far
from
a
top
tier
pumpkin
brew
ok
at
best
overall
i
dont
like
pumpkin
beers
in
general
but
i
find
this
surprisingly
drinkable
and
easy
to
sip
it
isnt
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
can
remember
but
it
is
far
from
the
worst
overall
its
a
slightly
belowaverage
pumpkin
ale
and
not
one
id
seek
out
again
this
is
a
tricky
style
that
many
breweries
fail
when
undertaking
however
it
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
other
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
isnt
even
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
but
not
one
im
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
im
glad
it
comes
in
the
variety
pack
because
it
is
a
nice
seasonal
to
throw
in
a
session
clear
dark
copper
more
reddish
than
orange
with
a
short
beige
cap
that
settled
to
a
collar
within
a
couple
of
minutes
lots
of
caramel
and
spices
in
the
aroma
mostly
nutmeg
but
with
some
cinnamon
and
ginger
as
well
slightly
toasty
slightly
vegetable
quality
up
front
in
the
flavour
moderate
bitterness
that
appeared
towards
the
finish
sweet
and
spicy
in
the
middle
a
little
bready
more
of
the
nutmeg
and
ginger
with
slight
cinnamon
that
was
apparent
in
the
nose
slightly
slick
in
the
finish
nice
texture
overall
medium
to
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
pretty
easy
drinking
the
alcohol
wasnt
too
high
in
this
and
i
couldnt
detect
it
at
all
during
my
session
although
i
like
the
octoberfest
i
feel
that
sam
should
make
this
the
fall
seasonal
this
would
be
worthy
of
that
moniker
and
theres
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
welcome
addition
to
their
current
offering
of
beers
o
i
like
this
one
for
the
subdued
spiciness
much
more
of
a
session
pumpkin
ale
darker
in
color
than
other
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
did
have
a
very
nice
pumpkin
like
smell
to
it
this
beer
did
have
a
very
pumpkin
taste
to
me
but
it
was
a
different
kind
of
taste
that
i
really
cant
describe
i
found
this
beer
more
interesting
than
most
and
will
be
finishing
the
6
pack
i
purchased
draft
at
first
i
liked
this
beer
but
after
a
couple
of
sips
in
i
couldnt
drink
it
anymore
between
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
it
smelled
pretty
good
i
got
some
pumpkin
in
the
taste
but
i
felt
like
the
sweetness
overpowered
it
as
it
warmed
up
it
got
progressively
worse
this
one
is
heavy
on
the
spices
so
beware
if
thats
not
your
thing
o
this
has
great
smell
and
taste
almost
like
mulled
wine
however
the
carbonation
really
takes
the
flavor
out
of
it
while
its
in
your
mouth
if
this
had
a
bit
more
pumpkin
and
less
fizz
it
would
go
from
good
to
excellent
i
bet
it
would
be
even
better
on
tap
honestly
this
is
more
like
an
american
amber
ale
with
some
pumpkin
flavoring
than
a
true
pumpkin
ale
a
good
fall
beer
regardless
o
better
than
expected
id
rate
this
as
a
poor
mans
punkin
a
good
pumpkin
beer
with
a
decent
spice
mix
and
good
balance
just
not
quite
enough
power
in
the
taste
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
fairly
full
bodied
compared
to
most
sam
adams
selections
and
a
decent
value
o
promising
sight
and
smell
but
falls
short
once
it
hits
the
lips
i
was
slightly
put
off
by
the
sourness
i
detected
in
the
aftertaste
there
are
much
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
for
consumption
this
halloween
burnished
copper
color
that
kicks
up
an
inch
high
head
of
beige
foam
that
quickly
recedes
back
and
settles
out
to
a
sizzling
surface
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
subtle
nutmeg
balanced
flavor
of
biscuity
malt
notes
of
honey
and
ginger
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
some
floral
notes
and
a
slight
lemony
snap
in
the
finish
a
peppery
spice
bite
lingers
not
a
lot
of
pumpkin
flavor
to
pick
out
but
it
tastes
like
a
respectable
slice
of
pie
even
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
finishes
a
bit
tingly
good
beer
overall
mouthfeel
has
a
creamy
texture
with
a
nice
medium
body
feel
overall
sam
adams
has
done
a
fine
job
with
their
pumpkin
beer
but
its
certainly
not
my
favorite
i
could
see
how
this
would
appeal
to
the
typical
sam
adams
market
o
drank
this
one
out
of
a
friends
sampler
pack
will
be
sure
to
never
do
so
again
o
i
waited
until
the
temperature
outside
was
at
least
55f
before
i
consumed
this
one
it
is
truely
a
wonderful
fall
beer
and
one
i
will
look
forward
to
next
year
o
good
beer
but
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
got
it
in
a
variety
pack
but
other
then
that
ive
never
seen
it
much
better
then
some
in
this
style
but
this
one
tends
to
lean
on
the
spices
more
than
the
pumpkin
overall
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
i
really
appreciate
that
they
tone
down
the
spices
and
let
the
subtle
taste
of
pumpkin
stand
out
c
not
a
bad
beer
easy
drinking
nice
surprise
o
it
seems
like
no
time
of
the
year
and
i
include
even
winter
brings
out
the
seasonal
offerings
like
fall
not
only
are
there
marzen
and
marzenlike
offerings
there
is
the
pumpkin
beer
sams
attempt
is
similar
to
many
of
their
offerings
not
terrible
but
not
amazing
it
is
light
on
spice
and
body
and
it
has
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
there
is
some
decent
pumpkin
at
the
start
but
the
earthy
starchy
qualities
of
the
pumpkin
disappear
too
quickly
o
my
search
for
a
great
pumpkin
ale
continues
i
wasnt
really
expecting
much
from
this
one
so
it
didnt
disappoint
but
it
just
lacked
much
in
the
way
of
both
pumpkin
and
spice
other
than
cinnamon
overall
it
was
pretty
average
theres
much
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
this
was
more
a
lot
of
clove
and
cinnamon
little
pumpkin
12
oz
bottle
pours
clear
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
spices
and
pumpkin
medium
oily
slightly
crisp
body
toasted
malt
caramel
cinnamon
nutmeg
herbal
hops
and
pumpkin
nicely
balanced
on
the
palate
it
was
my
first
pumpkin
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
o
impressed
by
this
fall
seasonal
i
would
pick
up
a
6
pack
of
this
each
fall
so
far
the
best
of
the
fall
sampler
pack
taste
is
pumpkin
and
spice
nicely
balanced
and
with
a
sharp
peppery
undertone
overall
a
tasty
and
welldone
pumpkin
ale
though
not
among
my
favorites
overall
this
was
just
not
a
good
beer
and
was
soon
poured
down
the
sink
the
spices
were
just
too
over
powering
and
the
beer
was
not
enjoyable
in
the
least
oexactly
what
youd
expect
from
sam
adams
a
decent
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
that
someone
just
starting
out
can
try
another
one
from
the
mixed
12
poured
a
nice
dark
red
color
with
a
bit
of
creamy
white
head
pretty
standard
all
around
both
on
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
some
pumpkin
spice
sweet
malt
a
little
caramel
and
an
easy
drinking
medium
body
not
bad
but
not
much
more
overall
a
poor
representation
of
what
ive
come
to
know
as
the
standard
for
this
beer
style
and
somewhat
of
a
let
down
given
the
great
pumpkin
ales
brewed
by
the
neighboring
breweries
my
only
thoughts
were
that
i
was
glad
it
wasnt
my
first
pumpkin
ale
o
the
head
was
disappointing
smelled
good
but
not
much
pumpkin
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
was
also
a
bit
disappointing
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
one
since
i
look
forward
to
the
release
of
pumpkin
beers
each
fall
the
beer
pours
a
orangishbrown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
classic
pumpkin
ale
with
lots
of
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
notes
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
a
ton
of
pumpkin
along
with
the
classic
pumpkin
pie
spices
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
i
also
get
some
caramel
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
quite
as
good
as
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
or
st
pumpking
but
a
step
above
most
of
the
pumpkin
ales
that
are
on
the
market
im
liking
this
autumn
pack
so
far
from
sa
i
could
definitely
could
have
a
6
of
these
mostly
because
the
abv
was
low
and
i
enjoyed
the
spices
good
drinking
pumpkin
for
the
masses
enjoy
after
raking
leaves
pours
a
medium
dark
brown
with
only
a
thin
layer
of
carbonation
on
top
scent
of
pumpkin
and
spices
are
very
evident
very
flavorful
and
full
of
spice
drinks
rather
smooth
that
goes
well
with
the
fall
weather
has
all
the
great
spices
that
are
in
pumpkin
pie
including
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
quite
delicious
and
gets
me
in
the
fall
mood
the
only
downside
is
that
i
can
only
find
this
beer
in
the
fall
sam
adams
sampler
pack
o
a
solid
beer
and
fits
the
style
goes
down
easy
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
no
problem
one
of
the
better
fall
seasonals
i
have
had
this
year
overall
the
flavor
is
good
perhaps
a
bit
too
mild
nothing
real
special
but
its
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
overall
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
i
would
like
a
little
more
going
on
glad
the
pack
only
came
with
two
it
isnt
bad
but
there
are
far
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
o
for
me
this
beer
went
through
a
lot
of
stages
the
pour
was
terrible
the
aroma
provided
what
i
want
in
a
pumpkin
beer
the
flavors
started
nice
then
finished
not
so
nice
this
was
just
another
average
pumpkin
beer
for
me
this
is
one
of
the
few
pumpkin
ales
that
actually
manage
to
get
a
very
good
pumpkin
flavor
in
the
beer
without
overloading
on
the
spices
true
they
are
present
but
i
think
the
actual
pumpkin
meat
is
displayed
rather
nicely
i
give
this
one
an
overall
of
4
0
not
bad
for
their
first
try
at
puumpkin
ale
and
very
drinkable
not
the
best
one
i
have
had
but
very
nice
pours
a
deep
amber
a
slightly
caramel
head
quickly
dissipates
into
a
thin
film
smell
is
allspice
some
pumpkin
sweet
malts
taste
is
pretty
full
allspice
tiny
bit
of
clove
some
subtle
roasted
malt
not
hugely
spiced
pumpkin
is
throughout
and
works
ok
with
the
minor
spicing
and
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
fine
some
larger
bubbles
off
the
tongue
medium
bodied
overall
this
delivers
as
a
pumpkin
ale
but
not
something
i
will
be
purchasing
again
nothing
really
stands
out
for
me
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
12
finger
offwhite
head
that
vanished
almost
as
soon
as
i
was
finished
pouring
the
carbonation
is
very
light
i
can
practically
count
the
bubbles
on
one
hand
aroma
is
of
spice
and
a
light
caramel
note
1st
sip
brings
a
note
of
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
allspice
with
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
and
a
rich
background
of
pumpkin
this
is
the
closest
to
the
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
cliche
that
i
have
ever
come
across
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
pours
a
clear
russet
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
pleasantly
spiced
pumpkin
pie
aroma
along
with
caramel
malt
and
subtle
pumpkin
mellow
flavor
all
around
spices
show
up
in
the
aftertaste
cinnamon
ginger
clove
smooth
and
easy
going
sweetish
caramel
and
a
touch
of
bread
but
not
a
tremendous
amount
of
pumpkin
smooth
and
drying
in
the
finish
certainly
not
bad
at
all
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
be
perfectly
happy
fall
2011
has
arrived
into
a
pint
glass
this
pours
a
very
clear
ruby
red
highlighted
amber
color
under
a
light
tan
colored
head
aroma
is
mild
with
a
note
of
pumpkin
spice
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
cinnamon
a
hefty
grainy
toasted
malt
body
comes
through
in
the
mouthfeel
and
finishes
with
a
somewhat
peppery
spiced
detail
not
much
sweetness
seems
to
come
through
in
the
flavor
to
me
and
i
am
led
to
believe
that
this
is
more
in
the
style
of
a
traditional
pumpkin
ale
as
opposed
to
the
big
and
eclectic
fall
brews
of
american
craft
beer
today
im
curious
to
try
this
with
one
food
drinkable
with
a
pretty
good
flavor
i
would
say
a
tad
too
much
spice
for
the
body
and
size
of
the
beer
overall
i
will
have
to
say
that
is
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
tried
but
a
reasonable
one
at
best
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
out
on
draft
if
possible
i
would
try
it
again
if
it
were
offered
to
me
taste
is
very
satisfying
creamy
full
mouthfeel
nice
pumpkin
flavorbut
not
overwhelming
some
roasted
malts
round
this
out
nicely
dfh
pumpkin
ale
is
my
fave
but
i
would
put
this
one
as
my
runner
up
very
well
done
good
stuff
pours
out
a
dark
red
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
leaves
little
retention
and
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
pumpkin
and
spices
the
taste
starts
with
some
spices
followed
by
some
hops
and
pumpkin
the
sweet
caramel
malt
is
consistent
through
out
and
gives
it
a
nice
balanced
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
but
easy
to
drink
and
overall
a
very
good
tasting
beer
that
gives
sam
adams
another
winner
overall
love
it
with
good
brews
like
this
it
makes
me
wonder
how
sam
adams
puts
out
some
terribly
mediocre
stuff
but
i
guess
with
the
kind
of
selection
they
offer
im
not
going
to
like
everything
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
like
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
i
was
anticipating
this
out
of
all
of
the
beers
in
the
harvest
collection
but
unfortunately
its
not
my
favorite
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
sampling
though
a
nice
addition
to
the
fall
sampler
not
the
best
pumpkin
ever
but
its
still
pretty
good
stuff
pretty
refreshing
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
sam
adams
offering
id
rather
drink
this
than
a
shipyard
an
ok
pumpkin
ale
especially
for
the
abv
but
there
are
way
better
out
o
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
but
perhaps
its
just
me
i
guess
i
just
dont
really
care
much
for
pumpkin
and
spice
in
beer
or
at
the
least
im
just
not
in
the
mood
for
it
i
found
it
quite
hard
to
drink
and
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
that
said
i
gave
the
remaining
brews
to
my
buddy
who
promptly
drank
them
down
and
said
he
quite
liked
them
so
dont
let
my
review
deter
you
a
solid
offering
from
the
boston
brewing
company
just
not
for
me
pours
out
a
clear
dark
red
beer
two
finger
whitish
head
smells
of
pumpkin
spices
lightly
scented
a
sweet
tasting
beer
mildly
offset
by
subtle
spices
no
real
mouthfeel
to
speak
of
the
beer
overall
is
decent
comparing
to
other
pumpkin
beers
that
ive
had
i
liked
it
just
fine
but
would
prefer
one
of
their
octoberfest
lagers
if
i
had
my
choice
in
the
cooler
update
i
dont
know
if
its
because
its
had
another
month
to
sit
or
its
just
the
reviewer
me
picking
up
different
things
from
the
same
beer
but
revisiting
the
sa
pumpkin
ale
i
definitely
pick
up
a
pumpkinnymalt
profile
that
going
back
to
my
notes
and
previous
review
i
either
missed
or
didnt
notice
at
first
its
there
folks
and
its
delicious
that
said
i
still
like
this
beer
and
would
consider
buying
it
in
a
sixpack
if
that
was
an
option
especially
at
samuel
adams
price
point
overall
a
nice
offering
from
a
very
solid
brewery
theres
nothing
they
cant
pull
off
make
a
ton
of
to
include
in
boxes
and
ship
to
the
masses
well
done
o
the
taste
kills
it
and
the
taste
is
the
most
important
part
of
beer
as
far
as
macro
pumpkin
beers
go
its
good
mostly
spice
rather
than
pumpkin
but
still
good
just
not
great
oh
and
btw
please
sell
this
beer
in
6
and
12
packs
on
its
own
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
hints
at
pumpkin
pie
but
i
tend
more
towards
wanting
more
sweetness
like
some
other
pumpkin
beers
however
they
did
good
on
making
an
easy
drinking
subtle
version
cheers
o
i
like
it
the
2nd
best
i
have
had
of
the
style
pumking
rules
but
too
much
abv
for
regular
consumption
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
provides
caramel
malt
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
not
over
the
top
but
solid
tasty
and
drinkable
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
solid
wellconstructed
pumpkin
ale
a
nice
addition
to
the
autumn
mix
o
this
has
good
drinkability
i
wouldnt
mind
a
few
pints
of
this
on
a
breezy
autumn
night
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
solid
and
easy
going
pumpkin
ale
i
think
its
worth
a
try
and
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
thus
far
ive
found
one
excellent
pumpkin
ale
schlafly
two
very
good
ones
summit
imperial
pumpkin
porter
and
pumking
several
fair
examples
and
a
couple
of
poor
ones
while
this
is
fairly
solid
i
think
this
would
have
to
fall
between
the
very
good
and
fair
categories
enough
said
overall
this
is
the
second
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
bjs
brewerys
pumpkin
ale
being
the
best
ive
had
a
few
pumpkin
ales
and
none
have
pulled
off
the
pumpkin
pie
taste
i
know
that
is
exactly
what
those
breweries
were
going
for
but
that
is
what
i
look
for
in
a
pumpkin
ale
i
picked
this
up
in
the
harvest
sam
adams
12
pack
this
was
the
best
out
of
the
6
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
with
a
healthy
small
bubbled
chunky
light
tan
head
atop
a
vibrant
bright
dark
auburn
coloring
with
only
a
slight
hazing
the
nose
is
a
very
light
semisweetness
of
pumpkin
with
a
light
blend
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spicing
aromas
are
much
lighter
than
most
pumpkin
brews
flavor
is
a
rich
malt
sweetness
with
some
pumpkin
bread
characteristics
at
the
tailend
of
the
palate
the
spicing
is
very
light
and
faint
on
the
palate
but
deepens
with
the
aftertaste
and
does
a
good
job
balancing
overall
the
aftertaste
is
light
and
balanced
as
i
said
before
but
not
overly
remarkable
the
finish
is
quick
and
a
bit
on
the
limp
side
it
just
quietly
exits
the
palate
without
a
lot
of
fanfare
this
one
had
a
decent
start
but
comes
up
lame
down
the
stretch
poured
into
a
standard
pint
a
rich
deep
rich
copperbronze
with
a
thinner
slight
off
white
head
atoparomas
are
not
overspiced
wich
is
a
very
good
thingtoasty
with
a
little
cardamom
and
macefaint
cinnamon
in
there
as
well
a
lighter
mouthfeel
detracts
from
the
flavors
and
richness
of
the
beer
in
my
opinion
flavors
have
a
real
pumpkin
flair
to
themagain
the
spice
is
held
in
check
welland
its
quite
warm
and
toasty
a
solid
pumpkin
alebump
up
the
body
on
this
and
it
would
be
great
pretty
drinkable
for
what
it
is
a
good
fall
weather
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
to
be
able
to
do
more
than
one
but
i
think
i
could
do
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
i
can
dig
on
this
i
think
the
ambiance
helps
but
this
beer
screams
fall
2011
batch
with
an
expiration
date
of
feb
2012
sampled
on
september
8
2011
this
beer
is
handsome
and
inviting
on
the
eye
with
its
dark
ambercopper
color
and
softly
floating
head
above
some
wild
ongoing
carbonation
bubbles
the
pumpkin
and
spices
announce
themselves
in
a
lower
key
on
the
nose
they
are
there
but
not
overdone
the
body
is
on
the
full
side
clove
pepper
and
sweet
malts
rule
the
day
in
the
flavor
followed
by
a
moderately
bitter
finish
this
lands
high
on
my
list
of
pumpkin
ales
but
not
the
highest
still
quite
good
o
overall
its
an
ok
pumpkin
creation
but
not
my
favorite
style
not
over
the
top
on
spices
so
that
is
somewhat
what
i
like
out
of
pumpkin
ales
personally
it
needs
to
be
710
alcohol
to
mix
up
with
the
flavors
what
better
way
to
celebrate
the
lovely
cooler
weather
than
with
a
new
to
me
anyway
pumpkin
beer
this
one
pours
a
clear
dark
tawnyrusset
topped
by
a
finger
of
coppertinged
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
nutmeg
cinnamon
light
cocoa
mandarin
orange
syrup
and
a
touch
of
dark
wheat
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lightly
toasted
caramel
mandarin
orange
syrup
brown
sugar
cinnamon
light
clove
light
toasted
pumpkin
seeds
and
a
good
amount
of
wheat
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
a
very
solid
pumpkin
beer
one
that
doesnt
overdo
the
spice
and
goes
down
easily
and
the
flavor
ah
this
was
the
hit
of
pumpkin
i
was
seeking
again
the
co2
when
cold
and
freshly
poured
cuts
the
rich
pumpkin
malt
clove
cinnamon
and
allspice
let
it
warm
a
bit
let
some
of
that
co2
enter
the
atmosphere
and
you
have
a
rich
tasty
tribute
to
fall
that
makes
me
happy
its
september
i
increased
my
mouthfeel
from
a
2
5
to
a
3
and
increased
the
overall
from
a
3
5
to
a
4
but
you
have
to
let
it
warm
a
bit
a
gorgeous
orange
and
tan
color
and
delicious
spices
while
i
did
taste
some
pumpkin
it
was
mostly
in
the
background
but
those
warm
delectable
pumpkin
pie
spices
were
right
up
front
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
theyre
all
there
it
was
still
refreshing
and
crisp
too
and
even
though
it
is
heavily
spiced
it
is
fantastically
well
balanced
o
damn
if
this
beer
isnt
a
perfect
companion
for
a
cool
fall
day
the
upfront
spice
and
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
is
perfectly
reserved
in
flavor
which
makes
it
quite
sessionable
its
one
of
the
only
beers
of
the
style
i
could
have
multiple
pints
of
without
growing
tired
out
quickly
smooth
and
crisp
i
think
i
found
one
of
my
new
fall
favorites
overall
this
stuff
is
pretty
poor
not
a
good
flavor
just
a
haphazard
mix
of
flavors
that
do
not
mix
well
together
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
pumpkin
in
beer
but
it
seems
like
they
didnt
spice
this
right
o
a
very
nice
sam
adams
if
i
walked
into
a
bar
i
could
order
this
and
be
satisfied
but
i
wont
ever
be
elated
to
see
it
on
tap
ill
enjoy
its
brother
in
the
sampler
soon
o
i
was
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
guess
i
was
expecting
the
ghost
of
cranberry
lambic
pasts
o
i
love
this
beer
if
youve
read
my
other
reviews
all
four
of
them
you
know
my
experiences
are
limited
again
this
is
the
only
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
i
do
look
forward
to
trying
more
but
i
dont
really
miss
the
pumpkin
like
a
lot
of
you
do
on
the
other
hand
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
pie
still
this
screams
fall
to
me
and
i
love
it
and
look
forward
to
trying
more
o
i
like
this
years
batch
much
better
than
last
years
it
seems
to
have
more
spices
and
is
heartier
for
sure
it
actually
seems
like
a
pumpkin
beer
this
year
m
clean
and
clear
no
metallic
tones
or
anything
else
to
keep
you
from
drinking
two
or
three
or
ten
i
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
alot
of
them
but
not
too
bad
d
im
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
and
this
beer
was
damn
good
nice
representation
of
the
style
however
my
go
to
pumpkin
beer
is
still
michigan
brewings
screamin
pumpkin
spiced
ale
it
just
has
more
character
and
flavor
than
the
sams
o
trick
or
treat
trick
there
are
much
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
and
much
better
fall
beers
from
sam
adams
go
for
their
octoberfest
for
an
autumn
sa
beer
look
elsewhere
for
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
o
not
too
good
flavor
profile
lacks
depth
for
a
style
that
generally
has
a
good
character
from
the
spice
its
kinda
like
a
sam
light
with
some
spice
added
overall
i
have
vowed
to
drink
more
pumpkin
beers
this
year
but
i
dont
know
how
many
i
will
drink
if
they
are
very
close
to
this
i
like
this
but
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
maybe
when
it
gets
closer
to
thanksgiving
i
would
have
less
of
an
issue
with
them
guess
we
will
see
3
55
d
i
dunno
maybe
one
pumpkin
ale
in
all
the
world
is
plenty
and
this
one
isnt
it
its
not
so
much
a
pumpkin
ale
as
it
is
an
ale
with
pumpkin
it
saves
itself
however
by
foregrounding
the
flavors
of
pumpkin
pie
that
suit
beer
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
leaving
behind
the
others
no
vanilla
there
are
two
more
in
my
variety
pack
im
drinking
one
because
what
the
hell
but
im
giving
the
other
to
my
girlfriend
pours
a
clear
burnt
red
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
bit
scent
is
very
spicy
with
some
nutmeg
and
malt
roasted
malt
aromas
taste
is
like
pumpkin
pie
in
your
mouth
this
is
the
most
pumpkin
pielike
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
its
pretty
tasty
nice
flavors
of
pumpkin
pie
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
spicy
finish
drinkability
is
fairly
high
overall
this
beer
kinda
makes
me
start
appreciating
pumpkin
beers
good
example
overall
good
beer
overall
i
could
see
myself
reaching
for
this
time
after
time
during
the
fall
if
i
lived
in
a
colder
climate
definitely
worth
a
shot
o
i
should
say
that
i
am
a
fan
of
malt
heavy
beers
and
while
i
do
enjoy
a
good
ipa
i
really
like
the
irish
reds
and
scottish
ales
this
is
a
malty
beer
with
a
good
herbalspice
finish
its
a
solid
beer
maybe
not
the
worlds
best
pumpkin
ale
but
its
pretty
damn
good
no
i
wouldnt
trade
sas
octoberfest
for
it
but
it
would
make
a
nice
seasonal
compliment
to
the
octoberfest
o
a
good
beer
not
great
nothing
special
but
at
the
same
time
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
mouth
feel
and
overall
smokey
and
mediumbodied
peppery
and
dry
would
be
perfect
to
enjoy
by
a
campfire
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
smell
is
dominated
by
pumpkin
pie
and
nutmeg
there
is
a
slight
metallic
aroma
and
a
hint
of
ginger
it
tastes
of
nutmeg
and
ginger
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
pie
and
roasted
malt
and
a
bready
aftertaste
the
beer
is
smooth
with
a
medium
body
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
thought
the
aroma
was
nice
but
the
taste
was
a
little
overpowered
ginger
do
not
wait
for
halloween
to
try
this
one
let
me
start
by
saying
that
i
love
pumpkin
ales
this
pumpkin
from
sam
adams
is
fantastic
the
color
is
a
rich
brown
orange
the
smell
is
packed
with
ginget
and
pumpkin
spices
the
taste
is
of
brown
sugar
ginger
cinnamon
and
molasses
i
think
the
marriage
of
pumpkin
pie
and
beer
is
a
no
brainer
and
this
harvest
pumpkin
from
sam
adams
is
no
joke
i
got
this
in
a
variety
pack
but
i
would
love
to
find
it
on
its
own
a
great
beer
overall
i
loved
it
last
year
and
i
love
it
this
year
dont
get
me
wrong
its
no
pumpking
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
pumpkin
ale
that
could
hold
its
own
any
day
among
all
the
others
i
would
rate
this
as
my
4th
favorite
pumpkin
ale
to
date
im
not
sure
why
the
bros
rated
it
so
low
but
dont
take
their
opinion
make
your
own
like
dessert
in
bottle
a
sessionable
beer
thats
perfect
for
the
holidays
even
though
it
comes
out
in
august
pumpkin
beers
seem
all
the
rage
with
breweries
now
a
days
but
this
is
not
one
of
the
better
examples
less
spice
and
more
pumpkin
is
needed
here
for
the
very
definition
of
what
this
style
can
do
check
out
southern
tier
pumking
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
i
could
easily
enjoy
two
of
these
in
a
row
and
possibly
a
third
before
i
became
overspiced
myself
nicely
done
overall
in
all
fairness
i
am
not
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
this
one
though
seems
more
brown
hot
spiced
forward
and
i
enjoy
that
more
i
could
drink
this
one
more
easily
than
other
pumpkin
beers
that
is
for
sure
this
is
kind
of
an
average
pumpkin
beer
in
my
opinion
i
think
a
little
more
pumpkin
spicing
and
a
little
less
hoppiness
would
make
this
truly
shine
as
a
fall
seasonal
i
appreciate
a
good
pumpkin
beer
but
this
one
seems
overly
spiced
for
my
tastes
a
decent
showing
and
not
so
spicy
that
its
not
drinkable
although
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
the
overall
beer
is
definitely
worth
it
but
not
more
than
one
or
twoeven
with
a
meal
your
palate
will
appreciate
you
more
if
you
try
something
else
beforeafter
this
save
it
for
dessert
harvest
pumpkin
ale
has
some
surprisingly
good
characteristics
its
a
much
bigger
beer
than
it
really
is
the
flavors
are
highly
present
and
very
assertive
you
can
drink
one
of
these
and
thoroughly
enjoy
it
and
then
move
onto
something
more
sessionable
pumpkin
still
rocks
but
there
are
better
ones
a
bottle
of
this
was
given
to
me
from
a
friend
he
wasnt
sure
if
i
had
tried
it
before
and
i
hadnt
so
it
worked
out
really
well
this
beer
pours
out
as
an
brownish
amber
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
is
a
bit
fizzy
the
smell
of
this
beer
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
the
octoberfest
i
suppose
that
makes
sence
the
only
difference
on
the
nose
was
the
addition
of
a
little
pumpkin
aroma
the
taste
was
full
of
autumn
spices
and
the
lingering
pumpkin
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
the
overall
on
this
beer
is
that
its
pretty
good
but
a
little
tricky
to
get
your
hands
on
i
feel
the
octoberfest
in
far
superior
to
this
brew
and
its
more
accessable
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
a
very
solid
ale
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
consistent
and
not
something
i
would
turn
away
from
harvest
pumpkin
ale
is
a
nice
pumpkin
ale

if
you
are
looking
for
a
stronger
pumpkin
flavor
michigan
brewing
screaming
pumpkin
spiced
ale
would
be
worth
a
try
d
i
like
it
spice
is
spot
on
not
to
strong
it
has
a
decent
pumpkin
aspect
and
a
good
solid
beer
back
it
all
up
a
seasonal
but
not
a
novelty
rich
toasty
and
roasty
malts
do
a
good
job
of
matching
the
pumpkin
and
spice
while
letting
both
shine
nicely
rounded
and
balanced
very
drinakable
version
of
style
pumpkin
beer
why
not
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
would
be
to
say
a
litesugar
free
pumpkin
roll
the
malt
and
spice
help
to
offset
a
sweetness
that
can
get
to
sweet
if
you
know
what
i
mean
i
expected
more
from
the
aroma
and
maybe
it
will
come
as
the
beer
warms
as
far
as
taste
its
tasty
cant
lie
i
mean
seriously
pumpkin
beer
its
decent
i
could
drink
maybe
two
per
sitting
after
that
i
would
need
to
hang
myself
by
my
tongue
in
other
words
not
a
session
beer
for
me
but
if
one
is
looking
for
a
unique
taste
this
is
a
beer

her

for

i
will
admit
that
the
beer
as
the
maltiness
to
substitute
for
an

and
stand
out
a

in

a

a

is
upfront
and
builds
to
fill

the

with
a
taste
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
in
the
midst
of
it
all
pumpkin
makes
a
presents
way
too
much
spice
for
my
liking
these
holiday
spiced
beers
need
to
be
subtle
especially
if
you
want
any
trace
pumpkin
to
come
through
not
bad
but
one
bottle
is
more
than
enough
drinkability
its
okay
its
something
i
could
drink
again
and
be
alright
with
it
but
im
not
going
to
run
out
and
buy
a
whole
bunch
of
them
still
glad
sam
adams
is
brewing
different
kinds
of
beers
even
if
they
are
at
times
a
bit
weak
everything
balanced
on
this
beer
but
balanced
to
the
low
side
it
shouldnt
offend
too
many
palates
overall
an
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
d
average
drinkability
a
future
purchase
is
unlikely
d
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
with
a
pie
of
course
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
for
the
price
i
am
normally
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
as
i
find
most
of
them
to
be
simply
overwhelming
with
pumpkin
spice
that
being
said
this
is
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
as
the
bbc
does
a
great
job
of
keeping
everything
in
balance
and
not
letting
the
pumpkin
flavor
overwhelm
the
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
you
still
get
a
good
dose
of
pumpkin
but
its
perfectly
blended
with
caramel
malts
and
some
spicy
hop
notes
a
great
holiday
brew
as
it
just
tastes
like
fall
and
winter
pours
a
pretty
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
very
clear
and
nicely
carbonated
smells
decent
a
fair
amount
of
pumpkin
and
a
conglomerate
of
spices
that
belong
with
it
taste
begins
with
a
lot
of
pumpkin
and
picks
up
some
bitterness
towards
the
finish
i
get
the
typical
medley
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
feel
is
carbonated
and
sharp
maybe
its
the
spices
but
id
prefer
the
feel
to
be
a
little
smoother
drinks
decently
definitely
an
above
average
offering
of
a
pumpkin
ale
imo
d
could
drink
this
all
day
but
its
not
a
great
example
of
a
pumpkin
brew
probably
good
its
not
out
there
much
other
than
in
the
12
packs
second
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
and
i
now
know
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
my
dad
purchased
this
as
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
containing
6
different
sam
adams
beers
pours
a
deep
amber
colour
with
offwhite
head
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
allspice
and
pumpkin
pretty
much
how
youd
expect
a
pumpkin
beer
to
smell
id
guess
flavour
isnt
as
sweet
as
the
nose
would
imply
but
that
makes
this
easier
to
drink
than
some
of
the
bolder
pumpkin
beers
nice
carbonation
level
drinkability
a
very
good
seasonal
brew
that
i
would
get
a
six
ofif
it
were
an
option
nothing
out
of
the
ordinaryjust
a
very
well
crafted
brew
d
pretty
drinkable
its
not
topnotch
by
pumpkin
standards
at
all
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
wont
turn
off
your
average
beer
drinker
like
some
of
the
more
outthere
styles
do
that
said
its
also
not
terribly
interesting
to
drink
either
d
not
terrible
but
nothing
special
seems
generic
and
run
of
the
mill
i
expected
more
and
was
let
down
this
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
white
frothy
head
the
smell
is
of
pumpkin
spices
with
a
faint
hint
of
pumpkins
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
sweet
almost
caramel
like
with
pumpkin
spices
not
much
pumpkin
flavor
more
so
just
pumpkin
spices
i
was
hoping
for
more
pumpkin
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
i
would
consider
this
a
drinkable
beer
but
again
i
was
hoping
for
more
pumpkin
flavor

i
prefer
pumpkin

more
subtle
than
this
where
you
can
actually
taste

this
was

out

high

this
is
definitely
a
pumpkin
beer
one
could
have
a
couple
of
in
a
night
lighter
body
than
some
others
ive
tried
makes
it
go
down
very
easily
and
doesnt
fill
you
up
right
away
only
got
two
of
these
in
the
fall
harvest
pack
but
i
would
definitely
pick
up
a
sixer
of
it
this
had
the
most
pronounced
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
of
any
i
tried
this
season
an
above
average
beer
with
everything
one
expects
from
the
style
present
d
as
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
i
like
to
try
any
that
i
happen
to
come
across
typically
i
dont
usually
buy
sam
adams
mainly
because
it
is
so
readily
available
and
ive
had
most
of
them
and
i
like
to
try
a
new
beer
every
time
i
drink
but
this
is
my
first
go
around
with
this
particular
pumpkin
ale
overall
not
the
best
pumpkin
but
definitely
not
the
worst
a
good
pumpkin
ale
to
say
the
least
slick
and
somewhat
mellow
carbonation
makes
for
a
creamy
appetizing
mouthfeel
just
a
hint
of
dryness
peeks
through
in
the
end
along
with
faint
warmth
and
dusty
spice
d
a
solid
beer
and
certainly
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
unfortunately
the
beer
is
only
sold
as
part
of
the
samuel
adams
harvest
collection
12
pack
this
one
i
didnt
find
overly
impressive
it
starts
off
with
an
attractive
dark
copper
hue
and
and
a
bunch
of
light
tan
foam
swirling
in
my
perfect
pour
glass
the
aroma
is
nicely
malted
and
after
that
it
gets
kinda
weird
the
flavor
starts
off
with
caramel
and
pumpkin
thats
a
bit
sweet
after
sitting
for
a
few
seconds
it
develops
a
mild
sourness
that
lingers
and
distracts
from
the
initial
impact
overall
i
dont
think
the
beer
is
that
good
because
of
the
aftertaste
this
one
sure
looks
better
than
it
tastes
sorry
guys
this
one
just
doesnt
work
for
me
overall
a
good
harvest
drink
and
the
5
7
abv
is
a
pleasing
touch
moreys
bottom
line
a
pleasant
surprise
a
great
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
this
and
the
boston
lager
are
the
two
best
beers
in
the
fall
12
pack
from
sam
adams
with
the
octoberfest
getting
an
honorable
mention
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
i
found
it
to
be
quite
a
bit
sweeter
than
some
other
ones
which
ive
had
but
thats
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
spice
but
the
sweetness
is
quite
welldone
because
the
pumpkin
helps
balance
it
out
as
the
beer
warms
sam
adams
rarely
disappoints
and
this
is
no
exception
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
even
though
its
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
that
ive
had
d
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
there
are
betters
out
there
and
there
are
worse
out
there
too
it
works
for
the
price
blah
i
had
such
high
expectations
this
beer
does
nothing
for
me
personally
it
doesnt
have
the
spice
depth
or
character
that
several
other
pumpkin
offerings
dogfish
head
post
road
seem
to
have
i
honestly
cannot
taste
anything
that
gives
me
the
feeling
that
pumpkin
was
even
used
i
drank
three
to
be
sure
i
would
drink
it
if
it
was
free
but
if
im
spending
my
money
dogfish
would
be
what
id
buy
drinkability
got
better
as
the
beer
went
on
and
i
stopped
trying
to
think
about
it
like
candy
corn
at
halloween
enjoy
it
during
its
consumption
window
but
youll
never
desire
consuming
this
in
offseasons
d
not
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
in
fact
one
of
the
worst
i
have
tried
not
terrible
but
not
worth
trying
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
earthy
and
gourd
like
fruitiness
in
the
taste
cinnamon
and
vanilla
a
light
maltiness
a
spice
like
bite
and
a
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
spicy
aftertaste
big
spice
yet
not
too
overwhelming
adam
beers
for
the
most
partbut
this
is
one
of
their
best
i
will
say
this
if
your
looking
to
try
a
pumpkin
ale
for
the
first
time
then
this
may
be
your
best
bet
not
only
because
of
the
mild
pumpkinpumpkin
pie
spice
flavores
but
because
its
a
darn
good
beer
and
sam
adams
is
around
everywhere
d
i
thought
the
strong
flavors
might
become
grating
after
a
while
but
i
was
ready
for
more
by
the
end
of
the
glass
two
or
three
is
probably
the
max
though
this
one
is
strictly
right
down
the
middle
and
lies
just
short
of
mediocrity
i
guess
this
one
is
okay
for
pumpkin
beers
certainly
not
offensive
but
definitely
not
one
of
the
top
15
out
there
unless
you
really
dig
all
of
the
beers
in
this
mixer
this
one
doesnt
warrant
a
special
purchase
d
somewhat
average
but
i
would
definitely
need
more
flavor
to
drink
this
beer
again
in
the
future
d
pretty
drinkable
the
flavors
are
all
there
maybe
some
more
pumpkin
would
be
nice
d
this
beer
was
good
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
but
dont
get
me
wrong
i
wouldnt
mind
this
as
its
own
6
pack
nice
pumpkin
ale
sam
adams
d
this
one
suffers
the
fateof
most
pumpkin
beers
that
is
its
pretty
much
a
oneanddone
in
any
one
sitting
that
said
its
a
beer
id
drink
again
possibly
a
good
fall
harvestthanksgiving
brew
i
wouldnt
drink
this
if
other
things
are
available
although
it
isnt
the
worst
pumpkin
ive
had
d
easily
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
to
date
with
malt
allowed
to
maintain
the
lead
with
support
from
spice
and
pumpkin
rather
than
the
other
way
around
this
one
is
more
like
a
beer
spiked
with
pumpkin
instead
of
a
pumpkin
pie
with
a
dash
of
beer
drinkability
yeah
i
could
really
drink
this
beer
all
day
during
the
nice
temperate
and
cool
fall
moderate
abv
a
body
thats
not
going
to
weigh
you
down
and
a
nice
set
of
flavors
are
really
fitting
for
the
style
i
have
to
say
im
fairly
impressed
not
that
sam
adams
isnt
typically
solid
imho
but
this
one
really
kind
of
exceeded
my
expectations
while
it
may
not
compete
with
a
double
frog
hollow
or
pumking
with
a
year
of
age
on
it
it
is
really
super
solid
picked
up
a
sa
harvest
twelve
pack
to
try
the
dunkel
and
the
pumpkin
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
dark
orange
color
nearing
a
shade
of
burnt
rust
fairly
large
white
head
a
nice
looking
beer
to
start
smell
had
a
lot
of
spice
notes
to
it
taste
was
appealing
with
flavors
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
really
standing
out
mouthfeel
was
appropriate
for
a
pumpkin
ale
smooth
but
with
a
bit
of
heartiness
drinkability
was
good
as
this
beer
had
a
bit
of
body
to
it
and
had
an
enticing
flavor
that
made
you
want
to
take
the
next
sip
as
this
is
sam
adams
first
commercial
venture
into
the
seasonal
and
finicky
world
of
pumpkin
ales
i
was
skeptical
at
first
but
i
will
have
to
admit
sa
released
a
satisfying
brew
with
this
one
i
would
buy
this
in
six
packs
if
it
became
available
in
the
future
d
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
and
would
pick
up
a
six
pack
if
i
saw
it
in
the
store
pours
a
bright
clear
reddish
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
good
bit
of
lace
on
the
way
down
the
smell
is
typical
pumpkin
pie
spices
namely
the
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
allspice
the
taste
matches
the
smell
upfront
you
get
the
typical
pumpkin
pie
spice
flavors
this
is
backed
by
a
solid
caramel
malt
base
with
little
if
any
evident
hop
bitterness
or
flavoraroma
this
beer
is
crisp
and
relatively
dry
the
finish
leaves
a
lingering
pie
spiciness
im
glad
that
it
isnt
overly
sweet
and
is
well
attenuated
i
prefer
a
pumpkin
beer
to
be
dry
as
opposed
to
sweet
overall
im
quite
pleased
with
this
beer
i
feel
that
the
boston
beer
company
did
a
good
job
on
this
tricky
style
i
was
skeptical
that
they
would
take
the
easy
way
out
and
put
out
a
mediocre
pumpkin
beer
but
in
the
end
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
thick
three
to
four
finger
head
which
is
off
white
and
holds
good
retention
there
is
a
little
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
present
along
with
a
nice
pumpkin
spice
smell
well
rounded
but
not
as
rich
as
others
in
the
class
the
taste
is
of
a
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
little
toastiness
to
it
there
is
a
flavor
of
clove
and
cinnamon
over
the
top
with
a
good
but
not
great
pumpkin
flavor
again
for
the
class
it
is
a
nice
flavor
but
not
as
rich
and
bold
as
other
class
leaders
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
there
is
nothing
to
dislike
however
for
the
class
there
are
much
worse
options
there
are
also
better
options
with
a
bigger
and
bolder
taste
d
well
i
have
3
more
and
i
read
some
of
the
reviews
to
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
to
taste
more
spices
or
pumpkin
but
as
i
figure
it
in
a
30
dollar
case
it
wasnt
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
for
1
25
heck
shipyards
was
3x
worse
and
i
paid
a
solid
2
50
to
try
its
badness
again
just
to
review
it
here
solid
brew
it
felt
like
the
spices
came
out
more
as
this
beer
warmed
finished
very
nicely
overall
a
nice
ale
by
sam
adams
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
natural
pumpkin
taste
in
the
beer
a
very
impressive
brew
from
samuel
adams
although
ive
come
to
expect
impressive
brews
from
the
fine
boston
beer
company
d
last
year
i
would
have
probably
given
this
better
marks
however
because
i
live
in
an
area
that
gets
most
of
the
great
pumpkin
ales
pumking
schlafly
punkin
hoppin
frog
etc
this
one
is
standard
pumpkin
fare
compared
to
the
heavyweights
di
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
better
than
other
pumpkin
beers
out
there
i
just
wish
the
pumpkin
flavor
came
out
a
bit
more
i
wish
there
were
more
than
two
in
the
mix
pack
overall
a
fairly
well
balanced
pumpkin
ale
nothing
special
pretty
average
one
thing
i
like
about
this
one
is
that
it
doesnt
just
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
too
many
pumpkin
beers
overdo
the
nutmeg
and
other
spices
so
that
it
overpowers
the
pumpkin
flavor
theres
a
bit
of
harshness
on
the
end
that
might
be
some
tannins
from
the
vegetable
ive
had
some
pumpkin
beers
that
were
better
but
ive
also
had
some
that
were
much
worse
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
brew
the
only
issue
is
it
only
comes
in
the
harvest
pack
so
you
only
get
two
at
a
time
if
this
didnt
say
pumpkin
on
the
bottle
i
might
like
this
more
but
so
far
i
am
feeling
let
down
its
not
bad
but
also
not
what
i
want
out
of
a
pumpkin
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
is
drinkable
but
i
cant
say
much
more
than
that
for
this
beer
i
would
definitely
pass
on
this
one
and
order
the
oktoberfest
because
it
is
great
d
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
nicely
spiced
not
overpowered
by
sweetness
however
this
is
a
well
made
and
easy
drinking
pumpkin
beer
that
appeals
to
the
drinker
who
likes
the
style
but
prefers
not
to
have
the
beer
feel
like
dessert
notes
i
generally
dont
like
a
lot
of
spices
in
my
pumpkin
ales
but
in
this
case
i
actually
think
the
spicing
was
too
subdued
the
pumpkin
taste
seems
fresh
and
genuine
no
extracts
here
other
than
that
this
beer
really
didnt
impress
me
at
all
i
bought
the
fall
harvest
pack
just
because
of
this
beer
and
it
has
left
me
a
little
disappointed
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
it
is
a
very
safe
offering
it
just
isnt
ballsy
enough
there
are
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
the
appearance
is
a
reddish
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dissapates
quickly
to
light
lacing
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
sweet
spiciness
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
cloves
the
taste
is
upfront
sweet
spiciness
followed
by
a
well
balanced
crisp
and
slightly
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
dry
kind
of
a
niche
taste
which
causes
the
beer
to
loose
a
point
on
drinkability
its
a
good
brew
but
would
not
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
final
thoughts
definitely
one
of
the
better
largy
produced
pumpkin
beers
on
the
market
and
props
to
sam
adams
for
continuing
to
expand
their
lineup
drinkability
nice
brew
possibly
one
of
the
more
complex
varieties
that
i
have
yet
to
try
of
theirs
which
is
not
to
say
that
their
beers
are
not
complex
also
doesnt
seem
as
filling
so
easier
to
come
back
for
more
taste
is
predominately
caramel
malt
with
the
aftertaste
being
mostly
of
pumpkin
as
with
the
nose
the
spice
doesnt
beat
you
over
the
head
like
some
other
pumpkin
beers
but
its
strong
enough
to
know
what
youre
drinking
carbonation
is
solid
and
spot
on
d
i
actually
like
this
a
lot
if
i
could
buy
this
in
a
sixer
i
would
for
sure
i
dont
find
many
pumpkin
beers
in
mn
i
like
dfh
doesnt
distribute
here
and
st
pumpking
is
a
little
too
big
for
me
to
enjoy
regularly
this
would
be
that
beer
so
please
make
sixers
body
is
moderate
and
balanced
with
the
carbonation
and
light
sweetness
body
fills
as
the
beer
settles
and
outgasses
finally
becoming
a
bit
too
rich
and
hindering
the
drinkability
pretty
flat
in
flavor
overall
update
9292011
i
got
another
samuel
adams
autumn
mixed
12
pack
to
try
this
year
and
i
found
this
beer
not
to
be
as
bad
as
i
first
thought
it
doesnt
have
the
balance
of
pumpkin
to
spices
that
i
like
but
that
doesnt
make
it
a
d
beer
i
now
feel
that
this
beer
is
average
for
its
style
still
havent
tried
a
bunch
of
this
style
but
as
it
stands
now
this
beer
is
an
average
pumpkin
beer
drinkability
is
high
wish
there
were
more
of
it
in
the
variety
pack
a
real
delight
from
bbc
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
two
fingers
of
tan
head
this
beer
is
reddish
orange
in
color
the
aroma
is
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
the
usual
suspects
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
very
nicely
neither
the
aroma
nor
the
flavor
are
overpowering
in
any
way
it
just
has
a
solid
pumpkin
feel
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
gritty
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
a
cool
autumn
day
and
a
great
way
to
start
my
week
off
im
not
really
enjoying
this
beer
the
flavor
is
pleasant
enough
but
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
arent
of
a
quality
i
expect
from
this
brewer
i
would
skip
this
one
on
draft
and
if
i
buy
another
fall
mix
pack
there
are
better
beers
in
it
for
me
to
enjoy
d
better
than
many
other
pumpkin
ales
accessible
and
thankfully
not
overly
spiced
a
welcome
fall
release
from
sam
adams
and
a
pleasant
brew
on
this
mild
october
evening
great
pumpkin
ale
excellent
taste
really
nicely
done
i
really
liked
this
one
and
personally
wish
they
would
make
this
a
seasonal
sixer
along
with
the
octoberfest
very
nicely
done
asking
me
about
drinkability
is
probably
a
poor
choice
i
can
generally
drink
a
lot
of
everything
with
the
abv
being
moderate
one
could
easily
split
a
six
pack
with
a
buddy
on
a
cool
fall
night
d
i
like
the
fact
that
it
strays
away
from
artificial
additives
or
at
least
does
a
great
job
of
masking
that
fact
the
malt
profile
is
there
which
makes
the
subtle
real
pumpkin
flavor
more
enjoyable
not
overly
spiced
and
the
5
7
abv
adds
to
the
warming
effect
of
this
new
fall
seasonal
from
sam
good
job
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
2
white
creamy
head
that
stands
on
top
of
a
nice
rich
amber
color
body
i
smell
a
hint
of
cinnamon
and
clove
the
taste
is
very
nice
of
pumpkin
and
spices
it
reminds
me
of
a
spiced
brown
ale
the
beer
has
a
great
mouth
feel
and
i
think
is
a
very
drinkable
fall
beer
it
flavor
and
body
fits
the
fall
season
just
perfectly

its
not
going
to
usurp

for
me
but
with
the
fantastic
mix
you
get
in

collection
imperial
pumpkin
ginger
spicy
hops
with
good
notes
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
pumpkin
is
sutble
at
best
but
it
is
pretty
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
and
pretty
smooth
with

it

not

fan

this
one
is
a

choice
for
those
fans

spicy
but
without
a

overdominant
spice
thats
likely
to
throw
you
off

if

2012
i
sampled
this
beer
on
10202014
very
awesome
brew
is
kind
of
like
a
spice
beer
overall
i
really
really
like
this
beer
as
stated
above
its
basically
an
english
brown
ale
flavored
with
pumpkins
and
spices
and
i
find
it
very
delicious
im
definitely
getting
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
next
year
yes
its
worth
the
wait
the
best
tons
of
pumpkin
pumpkin
spice
warming
alcohol
and
i
even
got
a
bit
of
bourbon
hands
down
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
to
date
overall
this
is
actually
a
decent
brew
and
the
aroma
seems
to
indicate
a
true
pumpkin
brew
but
this
really
doesnt
taste
like
one
for
that
its
more
appealing
to
me
but
this
really
tastes
like
a
winter
warmer
or
perhaps
a
pumpkin
aroma
version
of
old
fezziwig
hard
to
score
this
one
decent
but
to
style
not
really
so
ill
be
on
the
fence
otoo
much
a
brown
ale
and
not
enough
of
a
pumpkin
beer
good
but
you
must
love
pumpkin
to
like
this
beer
a
solid
imperial
pumpkin
ale
nice
and
spicey
judging
by
the
label
of
this
beer
over
28lbs
of
pumpkin
per
barrel
you
would
think
this
brew
would
be
screaming
with
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
the
only
thing
i
could
taste
was
the
malt
i
dont
know
what
has
happened
with
the
boston
beer
company
as
of
late
but
it
seems
they
are
just
brewing
beer
to
say
they
brew
beer
the
best
pumpkin
beer
that
i
have
had
is
southern
tiers
warlock
have
you
tired
of
pumpkin
ales
come
to
think
of
them
as
redundant
and
predictable
try
fat
jack
love
it
or
hate
it
and
trust
me
theres
a
far
better
chance
of
the
former
youre
sure
to
find
it
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
its
impossible
to
walk
away
from
without
an
opinion

expect
as
much
of
the
holiday
spirit

be
ready

awesome
but
just
too
sweet
and
cloying
to
enjoy
sticky
sweet
not
distinct
enough
as
a
pumpkin
brew
to
be
worth
the
bother
disappointing
very
sweet
but
lacks
pumpkin
flavors
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
very
rich
malty
and
smooth
the
spicing
is
just
right
good
pumpkin
ale
22
oz
bottle
pours
amber
with
long
lasting
offwhite
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
grassy
hops
pumpkin
and
spices
body
is
full
and
crisp
pumpkin
caramel
spices
herbal
hops
nicely
balanced
on
the
palate
finish
is
long
semisweet
and
spicy
delicious
brew
o
this
is
my
second
bottle
of
the
season
and
id
say
it
is
disappointing
wont
be
buying
any
fat
jack
next
year
overall
its
not
bad
but
its
not
quite
got
enough
pumpkin
for
my
liking
as
the
spices
and
strangely
the
cheery
cough
syrup
flavor
get
the
top
billing
here
not
my
cup
of
tea
prost
lampertland
this
poured
a
thick
hazy
autumn
brown
with
a
fantastic
thick
head
spicy
nose
of
cinnamon
with
hints
of
nutmeg
clove
and
sweet
pumpkin
puree
a
little
boozy
but
a
lot
of
pumpkin
gourd
spicy
anise
caraway
nutmeg
but
very
little
cinnamon
come
at
the
finish
throughout
i
get
a
maltiness
that
had
significant
structure
and
volume
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
pumpkin
ale
1
year
aged
nearly
identical
appearance
aside
from
some
slightly
increased
haziness
the
aroma
is
slightly
more
funky
with
some
fruity
tartness
of
sour
cherry
atop
the
predicted
aromas
of
pumpkin
spice
and
malt
for
a
incredibly
curious
but
slightly
more
potent
aroma
despite
having
a
flavor
which
comes
through
as
shallow
on
pumpkin
as
the
fresh
vintage
the
funk
does
manage
to
cut
the
graininess
somewhat
and
make
the
beer
slightly
more
enjoyable
in
flavor
otherwise
most
of
the
glaring
imperfections
remain
the
texture
and
carbonation
remain
nearly
the
same
very
slick
and
nearly
under
carbonated
in
general
its
just
about
as
difficult
to
drink
as
a
fresh
fat
jack
and
any
aging
just
adds
to
the
complications
if
you
have
a
bottle
i
do
not
recommend
storing
it
away
this
may
be
the
most
under
the
radar
pumpkin
beer
out
there
for
craft
beer
geeks
simply
because
its
made
by
sa
dont
overlook
it
its
maybe
the
best
nonporter
pumpkinstyle
ale
ive
had
yet
of
the
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
id
say
this
one
is
closest
to
howe
sounds
pumpkineater
low
on
pumpkin
high
on
alcohol
more
brown
sugar
than
pumpkin
or
spice
well
okay
its
far
from
awful
but
its
not
what
i
want
out
of
a
pumpkin
ale
all
i
could
taste
was
the
alcohol
overall
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
for
about
the
same
price
id
probably
reach
for
pumpking
but
this
was
worth
trying
its
alright
pretty
good
pumpkin
flavor
still
have
not
had
anything
better
than
pumking
by
southern
tier
way
too
pumpkiny
serving
type
bottle
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
slightly
over
spiced
in
my
opinion
pleasant
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
a
nice
thick
mouthfeel
overall
like
i
said
before
im
not
a
samuel
adams
fanboy
at
all
yet
this
brew
is
balanced
beyond
belief
the
reason
why
i
might
be
enjoying
this
brew
so
much
is
that
beneath
the
spices
lays
a
nice
imperial
english
style
amber
ale
i
love
me
both
american
style
and
english
styles
of
the
amber
ales
and
lagers
i
think
they
nailed
this
one
this
brew
is
recommended
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
not
sure
why
it
is
getting
dinged
so
much
not
a
big
pumpkin
beer
fan
but
liked
this
one
very
much
i
expected
more
from
sam
maybe
thats
my
fault
disappointing
not
bad
just
less
than
i
expected
try
warlock
instead
overall
the
sweetness
for
me
detracted
from
this
beer
and
im
into
sweet
flavors
in
beers
the
sweetness
is
more
in
the
way
of
caramelized
sugar
and
its
intensity
took
away
from
the
subtle
pumpkin
flavor
the
spices
were
adequate
the
malts
added
to
this
beer
should
be
revisited
o
its
not
terrible
its
middle
of
the
road
pumpkin
and
spice
its
not
overly
spiced
not
overly
pumpkin
just
solid
i
think
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
ale
surely
one
of
the
best
out
there
which
isnt
saying
much
im
surprised
at
the
current
rating
of
82
the
spices
are
there
the
kick
is
there
the
taste
not
only
compliments
the
smell
but
is
more
intense
its
what
i
want
from
this
type
of
drink
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
stand
out
the
most
the
smell
is
very
warming
theres
a
nice
bite
to
the
drink
i
would
certainly
get
this
again
m
good
full
body
thick
and
a
creamy
finish
overall
this
works
and
it
is
a
great
treat
but
not
a
trick
bool
the
end
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
that
has
about
a
good
12
finger
offwhite
foamy
head
that
settles
down
to
about
a
2mm
layering
on
top
and
a
bit
more
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
but
not
a
lot
the
aroma
is
full
of
pumpkin
and
spices
very
pleasant
and
makes
me
wish
it
was
autumn
lots
more
going
on
with
the
taste
with
a
good
amount
of
punkin
flavor
with
some
spice
that
probably
consists
of
clove
and
nutmeg
with
some
malts
very
tasty
and
medium
bodied
goes
down
easy
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
perfect
carbonation
for
this
type
of
brew
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
seasonals
taste
palate
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
full
bodied
festive
beer
the
base
has
a
solid
gingerbread
like
maltiness
with
loads
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
it
also
has
notes
of
vanilla
and
a
very
mild
bourbon
like
boozy
character
in
the
middle
of
all
this
there
is
a
very
mild
squashsweet
potatoe
like
sweetness
the
finish
brings
some
light
herbal
hop
bitterness
and
dryness
which
blends
with
the
dry
spice
within
the
dry
spice
lingers
and
begs
you
to
take
another
sip
a
very
average
and
forgettable
pumpkin
ale
not
a
particularly
good
beer
probably
would
taste
better
very
cold
the
appearance
and
aroma
are
both
ok
some
pumpkin
beers
are
like
pumpkin
pie
some
like
pumpkin
muffins
and
some
actually
taste
like
pumpkin
fat
jack
tastes
like
pumpkin
bread
one
of
the
better
beers
from
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
o
one
of
the
more
malty
pumpkin
beers
that
ive
tried
and
i
think
it
works
well
the
pumpkin
flavors
and
the
sweetness
of
the
caramel
malt
work
nicely
together
well
done
o
overall
a
very
drinkable
but
sadly
bland
beer
was
hoping
for
mor
of
a
pumpkin
spiced
beer
but
not
even
slod
as
such
good
beer
non
the
less
c
3
75
d
tasty
beer
other
than
it
being
a
bit
tame
its
tasty
and
drinks
well
overall
this
was
much
better
than
expected
i
dont
pick
up
much
pumpkin
but
the
malty
backbone
and
creaminess
of
this
beer
is
very
nice
the
spices
dark
malts
and
smokiness
add
a
lot
of
complexity
to
this
beer
and
makes
you
want
to
keep
trying
it
i
know
you
will
be
shocked
by
this
but
it
goes
very
well
with
pumpkin
bisque
this
offering
is
more
fullbodied
than
most
pumpkin
ales
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
this
style
this
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
pumpkin
and
spice
the
texture
is
much
creamier
then
i
would
have
expected
the
mixture
of
pumpkin
and
spice
is
just
right
with
a
great
finish
finishes
with
a
touch
of
lingering
cinnamon
it
still
doesnt
rival
the
taste
of
pumking
but
it
is
still
very
good
in
its
own
way
o
pleasant
experience
i
would
buy
it
again
next
fall
my
only
critique
is
the
pumpkin
taste
got
lost
in
all
the
other
things
they
got
going
on
which
is
really
what
the
beer
is
suppose
to
be
about
pumpkin
ale
other
than
that
a
great
beer
beautiful
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
orangish
head
spices
and
a
hint
of
sweet
pumpkin
excellent
flavor
a
real
seasonal
that
is
different
from
others
ive
had
the
pumpkin
taste
is
there
but
not
over
powering
nutmeg
with
a
sweet
after
taste
no
bitterness
mouth
feel
medium
carbonation
and
body
overall
a
very
pleasant
surprise
sam
adams
hit
the
mark
with
this
one
not
bad
the
fruitiness
was
offputting
and
the
spices
overwhelmed
a
bit
but
very
festive
im
not
big
on
ginger
my
favorite
part
about
this
brew
is
the
dry
finish
in
terms
of
flavor
this
is
not
particularly
unique
a
well
spiced
pumpkin
beer
high
in
alcohol
and
big
in
flavor
in
terms
of
feel
it
is
different
very
rich
for
the
style
with
a
lot
of
body
as
long
lasting
stick
to
your
guts
sweet
finish
that
makes
it
a
pleasantly
warming
autumn
offering
a
gorgeous
dark
appearance
glowing
the
deepest
amber
and
boasting
a
generous
off
white
cream
head
with
ring
lacing
as
it
drinks
aromatics
of
ginger
and
clove
above
sweet
red
and
caramel
malt
plenty
of
spice
but
keeping
balanced
flavors
throughout
regal
richness
on
the
finish
really
quite
lovely
this
fills
me
up
a
little
warms
me
up
a
lot
and
genuinely
ignites
the
holiday
spirit
in
me
tis
the
season
and
this
beer
is
a
perfect
seasonal
reminder
of
the
beauty
of
the
harvest
and
the
months
to
come
i
believe
this
is
woefully
underrated
on
ba
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
color
was
a
dark
reddish
burgundy
with
a
thick
2
finger
off
white
head
aroma
was
predominantly
spicey
nutmeg
and
cloves
slight
earthiness
akin
to
pumpkin
as
well
flavor
was
peppery
with
some
sweetness
from
the
pumpkin
not
overly
spiced
or
overly
sweet
nicely
balanced
felt
decent
in
the
mouth
a
bit
of
bite
not
overly
thick
coated
ok
overall
a
solid
beer
at
the
6
i
paid
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
pretty
decent
pumpkin
offering
here
and
something
id
likely
try
again
given
its
availability
worth
trying
if
you
like
a
full
bodied
pumpkin
ale
without
too
much
pumpkin
character
an
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried
i
likeem
malty
with
a
little
kick
overall
a
good
beer
i
would
say
its
actually
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
its
not
blowing
my
socks
off
or
anything
but
its
good
overall
this
is
an
an
interesting
novelty
seasonal
beer
i
recommend
it
if
you
have
not
had
it
before
but
i
dont
know
i
would
order
it
regularly
therefore
i
cant
rate
its
drinkability
very
high
o
i
was
curious
what
sam
adams
would
do
with
their
shot
at
this
style
glad
to
see
they
took
not
only
the
balanced
approach
but
a
unique
one
too
balanced
flavors
crossvarietal
even
and
an
appreciably
high
abv
for
the
style
as
stated
before
make
sure
you
want
a
beer
not
pie
o
this
beer
is
an
outright
pumking
clone
same
sweetness
same
vanillaheavy
nose
same
abv
for
goodness
sake
8
5
for
sa
8
6
for
st
but
theres
just
something
so
special
about
pumking
that
this
beer
doesnt
capture
something
that
makes
it
like
taking
a
bite
of
the
worlds
best
pumpkin
pie
im
guessing
its
the
pie
crust
malt
and
authentic
pumpkin
earthiness
that
this
beer
is
lacking
that
said
this
is
an
excellent
pumpkin
ale
and
one
of
the
best
seasonal
ive
had
from
sam
adams
sweet
but
satisfyingly
so
overall
the
name
is
fortunately
misleading
probably
because
the
pumpkin
pie
routine
does
not
overwhelm
in
favor
of
good
beer
should
be
good
for
sipping
on
a
cool
fall
day
overall
its
an
ok
beer
a
little
underwhelming
because
i
like
the
style
and
sam
adams
bombers
are
usually
better
than
their
12ounce
bottled
beers
however
its
just
a
bit
too
spicy
o
this
reminds
me
of
setting
around
a
camp
fire
in
fall
with
the
smell
of
pumpkins
and
spice
crackling
in
the
air
the
pumpkin
is
not
like
your
typical
artificial
pumpkin
pie
flavored
beer
but
a
more
roasty
and
earthy
flavor
its
quite
nice
and
warming
overall
a
rather
tasty
pumpkin
ale
its
a
little
on
the
sweeter
side
for
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
but
is
still
balanced
in
many
respects
as
it
has
a
good
blend
of
booze
spice
and
pumpkin
to
tame
the
sweet
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
drinker
o
sam
adams
has
always
has
unique
seasonal
beers
and
this
one
unfortunately
is
a
little
disappointing
sure
it
has
some
pumpkin
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
a
lot
more
as
a
fallthemed
beer
its
great
but
as
a
pumpkin
beer
it
misses
its
mark
o
a
pretty
good
seasonal
from
sam
adams
this
is
a
nice
alternative
to
the
droves
of
lightersmoother
pumpkin
ales
that
flood
the
market
around
this
time
of
year
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
good
in
small
doses
o
for
a
pumpkin
ale
this
doesnt
fit
the
bill
for
an
abbey
ale
its
just
right
dark
fruits
overrule
the
pumpkin
and
stay
all
night
for
a
pleasant
sipper
taste
is
a
little
milder
than
the
nose
would
indicate
with
the
malts
holding
their
own
against
the
spices
it
has
the
typical
sam
adams
yeastburnt
caramel
character
i
seem
to
get
in
so
many
of
their
beers
it
tastes
a
bit
like
sauteed
pumpkin
left
in
the
skillet
a
little
too
long
its
ok
i
wont
buy
it
again
but
ill
finish
my
half
bottle
sample
the
taste
surprises
as
well
as
the
beer
is
more
hop
forward
than
ive
experienced
with
pumpkin
beers
caramel
and
toffee
notes
hit
the
tongue
first
followed
by
subtle
pumpkin
and
spice
and
a
bit
of
heat
from
the
booze
smokiness
shows
up
throughout
and
adds
a
layer
of
complexity
the
beer
drinks
much
more
like
an
imperial
stout
or
dark
strong
ale
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
and
alcohol
burn
similar
to
those
beers
still
it
is
smooth
complex
and
overall
quite
enjoyable
i
am
impressed
by
this
beer
and
surprised
it
doesnt
receive
more
mention
or
love
such
as
what
pumking
gets
after
having
a
few
beers
tonight
i
decided
to
take
a
shot
at
samuel
adams
fat
jack
ive
got
to
say
every
time
i
passed
this
beer
on
my
way
to
pick
up
a
pumking
if
you
havent
had
it
you
need
to
find
it
and
hoard
it
forever
ive
got
to
say
im
pretty
happy
that
ive
picked
pumking
over
this
99100
times
i
feel
like
it
literally
tastes
like
a
slim
jim
the
smell
doesnt
add
a
thing
to
the
experience
and
the
taste
is
far
off
from
what
the
label
describes
it
as
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
something
you
can
drink
without
thinking
about
macho
man
randy
savage
would
definitely
drink
again
great
pumpkin
beer
without
being
overly
sweet
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
ruddy
orange
amber
with
a
fine
two
finger
pumpkin
colored
head
that
had
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
bready
malt
with
cooked
pumpkin
nd
hints
of
pumpkin
pie
spicing
mild
flavor
is
sweet
malt
gentle
but
distinct
smokiness
toffee
glazed
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
ginger
very
nice
medium
to
heavy
creamy
body
a
quite
sweet
pumpkin
ale
but
good
pumpkin
pie
character
and
i
really
liked
the
smokiness
like
eating
pie
around
an
open
fire
i
think
this
might
have
been
a
bit
cloying
without
the
smoked
malt
but
kudos
to
boston
beer
for
making
this
fun
to
drink
the
malt
support
really
makes
this
stand
apart
from
many
pumpkin
ales
that
are
all
about
spicing
i
liked
this
more
than
i
expected
to
and
will
add
it
to
my
fall
beer
rotation
well
done
o
overall
one
of
the
more
interesting
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
so
far
this
year
its
a
solid
take
on
the
style
with
a
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
and
palate
but
to
me
it
doesnt
overdo
any
of
the
characteristics
that
its
going
for
in
a
sea
of
overspiced
andor
oversweetened
pumpkinsodabeers
this
one
stands
on
the
higher
end
and
will
definitely
be
a
brew
ill
look
forward
to
if
youre
someone
who
generally
partakes
in
the
sam
adams
stigma
and
would
have
avoided
it
because
of
the
name
i
think
youll
be
pleasantly
surprised
if
you
reconsider
and
pick
up
a
bomber
or
five
atmosphere
is
really
nice
nice
head
and
some
thick
lacing
characteristic
nose
consisting
of
pumpkin
and
fall
spices
bitter
and
pungent
high
alcohol
combo
of
pumpkin
licorice
and
wood
components
very
robust
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
o
i
saw
this
one
advertised
in
beer
advocate
magazine
and
cynically
thought
it
would
be
another
macrobrewerys
attempt
to
capitalize
on
the
popular
style
but
when
i
saw
it
in
the
store
i
took
a
chance
im
glad
i
did
as
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
the
finishing
taste
was
a
little
off
but
just
slightly
otherwise
it
was
a
very
good
beer
i
think
its
a
little
pricey
but
i
would
and
did
recommend
it
to
friends
o
the
pumpkin
ale
category
is
very
very
competitive
for
sure
i
firmly
believe
that
a
lot
of
the
negativity
on
here
is
due
to
sam
adams
hate
overall
i
find
this
to
fit
in
quite
well
with
the
other
standard
pumpkin
ales
out
there
and
is
definitely
worth
a
drink
o
i
was
not
disappointed
i
prefer
stouts
and
such
but
would
like
to
revisit
this
one
o
good
but
far
from
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
o
could
have
done
without
trying
this
one
it
wasnt
great
the
two
row
and
8
abv
ruined
this
beer
for
me
appearance
is
a
deep
ruby
hue
with
highlights
all
day
thick
textured
tan
head
fills
the
glass
light
sporadic
chunky
layered
lacing
gives
you
the
idea
of
texture
aroma
has
a
hint
of
spice
and
earthy
hop
additions
its
actually
pretty
muted
on
the
nose
go
figure
flavor
has
it
all
ginger
all
spice
cinnamon
to
the
point
where
it
almost
burns
you
its
a
beer
that
actually
feels
like
its
a
heated
addition
due
to
the
level
of
ginger
this
fat
jack
decided
to
take
on
its
a
big
beer
almost
too
much
calories
i
could
guess
at
least
500
per
12
ounce
serving
residual
sugars
flood
the
mouthfeeel
making
it
full
to
the
bone
i
want
an
easy
drinking
ale
to
come
around
overall
there
is
alot
of
alcohol
detected
when
tasting
this
beer
that
i
dont
detect
when
i
smell
it
im
disappointed
by
the
taste
after
expecting
a
lot
more
from
sam
adams
special
beers
o
great
fall
pumpkin
beer
love
the
fact
that
the
pumpkin
isnt
overpowering
and
doesnt
mask
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
very
well
balanced
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
one
is
enough
specially
since
i
had
a
22
oz
bomber
strong
stuff
and
you
can
feel
the
burn
o
top
10
pumpkin
beers
theres
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
think
many
are
disappointed
because
it
labels
itself
a
double
pumpkin
beer
when
actually
the
pumpkin
flavor
takes
a
backseat
to
the
spice
there
are
flavors
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
malt
a
bit
of
hops
and
vanilla
the
alcohol
is
well
concealed
in
the
taste
but
theres
nothing
here
thats
particularly
exciting
i
paid
around
8
for
1
pt
6
fl
oz
hence
the
slightly
lower
overall
rating
and
frankly
i
wish
i
wouldve
spent
that
money
elsewhere
but
the
beer
was
still
enjoyable
overall
i
was
pretty
surprised
by
this
one
sam
adams
rarely
disappoints
but
this
was
a
tier
higher
than
i
was
expecting
from
them
i
was
expecting
a
top
15
pumpkin
brew
but
this
is
easily
in
the
top
six
the
only
thing
keeping
it
from
really
excelling
was
the
lackluster
aroma
ill
probably
go
pick
up
a
couple
of
more
though
before
the
season
ends
so
i
can
have
some
in
october
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
hint
of
allspice
and
a
hint
of
hop
fits
the
style
of
a
pumpkin
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
slight
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
hint
of
hops
slight
pumpkin
and
strong
spices
overall
good
blend
appearance
and
body
heavy
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
aroma
has
decided
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
notes
plus
hints
of
malt
and
cloves
it
pours
a
clear
mahogany
with
a
fairly
thick
light
slightly
pumpkinorange
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
satisfying
flavor
has
a
malty
core
with
a
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
pumpkin
tone
as
well
as
notes
of
cinnamon
horehound
and
cloves
and
a
touch
of
caramel
smooth
texture
has
good
body
though
not
a
lot
of
fizz
refreshingly
suitable
malt
base
to
carry
this
spiceforward
ale
ginger
up
front
but
not
overpowering
i
was
expecting
that
imperial
bite
in
the
taste
but
was
instead
hit
with
a
luscious
malt
base
on
the
palate
its
bready
toasted
malts
a
slight
smokiness
and
a
great
squash
character
plus
that
same
holiday
spicing
as
the
nose
very
ciderlike
theres
a
light
booziness
and
just
enough
bitterness
to
give
a
nice
kick
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
for
an
imperial
pumpkin
fat
jack
is
a
great
representation
of
the
dark
pumpkin
style
and
itll
definitely
be
a
beer
that
i
pick
up
again
next
year
overall
this
is
basically
their
harvest
pumpkin
ale
on
steroids
thats
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
as
the
harvest
pumpkin
wasnt
all
that
good
to
begin
with
drinkable
but
not
too
terribly
enjoyable
and
i
cringe
at
the
thought
of
paying
the
full
asking
price
for
it
o
the
nice
malt
depth
with
subtle
spices
have
an
interesting
smoke
hint
and
a
pumpkin
tartness
that
come
through
when
it
is
warm
nice
solid
pumpkin
beer
overall
a
really
solid
take
on
the
pumpkin
ale
style
real
pumpkin
taste
with
a
solid
spicing
that
doesnt
go
overboard
cheers
to
sam
adams
i
finally
found
it
the
pumpkin
ale
to
beat
all
other
pumpkin
ales
beer
is
mediumheavy
in
weight
with
fairly
modest
carbonation
considering
the
ethanol
and
heft
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
slightly
sluggish
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
perhaps
make
the
aroma
more
prominent
and
ease
the
sipping
of
this
beer
i
appreciate
the
heaviness
of
the
beer
though
as
this
seems
to
complement
both
the
heaviness
of
the
flavors
and
the
style
in
general
ethanol
warmth
on
the
back
of
the
palate
and
throat
not
unpleasant
finishes
rather
dry
with
a
bit
of
residual
stickiness
around
the
lips
o
overall
nice
drinkability
not
overly
done
spice
wise
but
a
blend
of
both
worlds
real
honest
pumpkin
flavor
with
just
the
right
amount
of
spicing
accent
which
doesnt
come
off
like
a
pumpkin
pie
in
a
blender
type
of
drink
usually
pumpkin
beers
are
at
one
end
of
the
spectrum
or
the
other
a
gag
full
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
or
just
a
bland
amount
of
pumpkin
pulp
with
little
spicing
this
seems
to
balance
a
nice
sweet
spot
inbetween
again
sam
adams
achieves
a
nice
balanced
very
drinkable
beer
that
you
just
cant
complain
about
this
is
really
good
stuff
m
medium
body
chewy
light
carbonation
thought
this
was
well
done
loved
the
color
dark
brown
decent
head
rentention
the
aromas
and
flavors
were
decent
nothing
spectaculr
but
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
with
a
nice
big
malty
body
that
was
the
best
thing
abiut
the
beer
is
that
it
had
some
substance
to
it
not
a
weak
spicy
pumpkin
soda
like
so
many
on
the
market
today
pumpkin
nor
the
spice
was
overpowering
and
the
brown
ale
base
was
solid
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
pretty
damn
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
everything
i
look
for
in
a
pumpkin
ale
with
some
nice
balance
and
a
pretty
creamy
mouthfeel
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
and
the
8
5
alcohol
barely
showed
up
in
the
taste
i
think
one
bomber
is
the
perfect
amount
with
this
beer
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
another
bottle
after
this
one
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
its
balance
and
the
fact
that
it
wasnt
overly
spiced
and
the
creamy
mouthfeel
was
also
pretty
noteworthy
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
i
cant
think
of
anything
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
about
this
beer
its
fine
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
buy
another
bottle
of
this
if
its
released
next
year
its
a
good
all
around
pumpkin
ale
and
it
isnt
that
expensive
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
pumpkin
ale
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
satisfied
with
this
beer
and
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
that
i
have
had
this
year
but
i
dont
think
it
knocks
the
now
retired
screaming
pumpkin
off
as
being
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
but
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
one
in
its
own
right
and
im
glad
that
i
took
a
chance
on
it
this
is
much
better
then
their
harvest
pumpkin
ale
and
its
worthy
of
being
put
in
bombers
good
job
guys
this
is
one
good
pumpkin
ale
thats
really
hitting
the
spot
on
this
cold
halloween
night
smells
of
a
sweet
caramel
apple
with
plenty
of
toasted
bread
and
pumpkin
pie
spice
in
layers
on
top
of
each
other
the
flavor
has
the
same
breadiness
and
pumpkin
pie
spice
but
with
a
touch
more
cinnamon
hotness
and
plenty
of
brown
sugar
fresh
meaty
pumpkin
is
actually
identifiable
within
the
flavor
profile
as
is
a
mild
sort
of
milk
chocolate
background
nuance
the
abv
is
semihidden
but
does
show
up
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
as
a
rising
heat
which
also
helps
to
dry
out
the
finish
im
quite
impressed
with
fat
jack
however
i
feel
guilty
for
dismissing
the
boston
beer
companys
ability
for
excellence
ive
seen
a
lot
of
great
breweries
spew
off
lackluster
or
illbalanced
pumpkin
ales
routinely
but
the
palate
is
certainly
rewarded
with
a
glass
of
fat
jack
on
the
eve
of
halloween
overall
this
is
what
i
expect
from
an
imperial
pumpkin
nice
bold
and
sweet
flavors
this
has
elements
of
an
english
barleywine
i
love
the
deep
rich
caramel
and
pumpkin
i
will
pick
this
up
again
next
year
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
small
snifter
light
beige
frothy
head
high
retention
body
is
dark
amber
to
light
mahogany
lacing
is
sudsy
and
sticky
aroma
includes
caramel
malts
some
brown
sugar
light
beef
jerky
no
idea
why
maybe
some
cinnamon
not
really
any
pumpkin
flavors
per
se
maybe
they
are
there
and
the
beef
jerky
smell
is
throwing
me
off
taste
is
also
not
pumkiney
just
hints
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
tickles
the
tongue
and
lips
slightly
pretty
tasty
beer
just
a
little
less
pumpkin
flavor
than
expected
from
a
double
pumpkin
beer
not
something
to
throw
down
a
sixer
of
at
a
halloween
party
but
a
nice
sipper
on
a
cool
autumn
night
overall
not
a
bad
effort
in
fact
its
a
relief
to
not
use
the
words
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
at
all
in
this
review
and
that
alone
makes
this
worth
sipping
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
flavorful
pumpkin
ale
slower
sipping
than
some
other
pumpkin
beers
this
one
is
satisfying
worth
trying
this
one
if
you
can
find
it
price
point
6
9916
9
oz
bottle
nevertheless
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
if
you
like
spiced
ales
or
if
youve
never
tried
something
like
this
give
it
a
shot
its
very
surprising
and
interesting
though
it
wont
be
added
to
my
list
of
favorite
beers
anytime
soon
but
at
8
5
im
a
happy
pumpkin
for
sure
o

this
is
a
solid
winner
when
youve
given
up
on
samuel
adams
main
line
of
beers
as
too
tame
dont
sleep
on
their
special
lines
there
is
quality
stuff
to
be
had
what
i
like
about
this
one
is
the
fullness
of
it
youre
not
left
wanting
the
spices
are
deftly
handled
and
just
a
pleasure
to
smell
without
being
attacky
and
overdone
on
the
palate
you
can
taste
real
pumpkin
flavor
and
dream
of
moms
pumpkin
pie
to
come
in
november
i
cant
wait
im
basically
a
fan
of
anything
doubleimperial
and
this
takes
pumpkin
ale
where
i
want
it
to
go
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
is
a
great
seasonal
offering
from
sam
adams
perfect
for
a
cool
autumn
night
its
way
better
than
their
harvest
pumpkin
ale
that
they
offer
in
their
harvest
mix
pack
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
overall
ok
i
tasted
it
and
now
back
to
something
better
overall
despite
some
issues
with
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
this
is
still
a
tasty
brew
and
that
is
certainly
most
important
overall
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
concoction
without
any
other
amped
up
pumpkin
beers
to
compare
this
to
methinks
this
is
a
pretty
good
ale
but
the
overly
boozy
aspect
distracts
a
bit
too
much
crippling
the
overall
enjoyment
find
a
way
to
incorporate
the
high
abv
a
bit
better
into
the
taste
profile
and
this
would
be
a
fantastic
fall
seasonal
m
strong
carbonation
and
thin
big
pumpkin
up
front
with
a
nice
spice
bitter
punch
definitely
get
cinnamon
ginger
and
clove
but
they
are
subtle
and
balanced
not
obnoxious
as
many
pumpkin
ales
can
be
has
real
creamy
smooth
mouth
feel
with
caramel
and
roasted
malt
coming
through
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
it
is
very
drinkable
i
dont
think
i
could
love
any
pumpkin
beer
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
and
it
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
to
not
like
it
rjt
this
is
a
solid
brew
from
sam
adams
this
new
line
of
beers
has
proven
to
be
quite
inspired
and
at
the
very
least
respectable
from
a
brewer
that
has
come
dangerously
close
to
being
macro
fat
jack
pours
a
deep
red
color
with
notes
of
cinnamon
and
big
time
nutmeg
taste
follows
suit
but
stronger
and
much
more
robust
than
their
harvest
pumpkin
ale
i
wish
it
were
creamier
like
an
iced
pumpkin
or
chai
latte
but
still
it
ranks
highly
in
its
field
pumpkin
ale
fans
should
check
it
out
drinkability
is
okay
a
lot
of
good
sights
and
smell
on
this
beer
but
the
taste
is
overpowered
by
some
very
smokey
malts
i
would
give
this
a
try
some
would
like
it
better
than
me
ruby

shines
when
brought

reminiscent
of
a

a
liqueur
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
that
leaves
some
slickness
on
the

a

that
showcases
the

the
pumpkin

a

more
of
a
sipper
this
one
chasing
that
elusive
perfect
pumpkin
ale
this
one
is
a
contender
but
it
still
falls
a
bit
short
its

a
fleeting

the
flavor
is

what
you
would
expect
very
straight
forward
body
is
medium
enough
carbonation
not
dry
and
drinkable
now
i
dont
love
pumpkin
beers
but
find
this
to
be
exactly
what
i
expect
from
the
style
a
easy
drinking
8
5
in
my
opinion
solid
pumpkin
brew
o
a
good
pumpkin
ale
overall
smells
great
though
a
little
too
boozy
and
lacking
the
complexity
of
the
aroma
d
fat
jack
is
welcome
in
my
beer
fridge
any
time
this
is
a
really
really
good
imperial
pumpkin
ale
that
i
had
expected
to
be
slightly
disappointed
in
given
the
reviews
ive
seen
bit
i
walk
away
rather
impressed
definitely
in
the
top
quartile
of
pumpkin
brews
ive
tried
if
theres
any
room
for
complaint
its
in
the
double
pumpkin
labeling
other
than
the
slight
heat
on
the
palate
there
is
little
or
no
indication
that
this
is
an
imperial
or
double
pumpkin
ale
none
the
less
this
is
a
highly
recommended
pumpkin
ale
and
a
damn
fine
job
from
boston
beer
company
o
great
flavor
in
this
beer
i
really
did
enjoy
it
unfortunately
not
what
i
was
expecting
with
a
name
like
double
pumpkin
i
thought
that
it
show
cased
the
malts
and
yeast
very
well
just
not
the
spicy
pumpkin
and
autumn
feeling
pumpkin
beer
i
was
hoping
for
o
feels
like
a
miss
for
my
palate
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
overall
just
too
much
like
pumpkin
and
not
enough
like
sweetpumpkinpiedessert
for
me
ymmv
o
different
take
on
the
dimeadozen
pumpkin
beer
starts
off
meh
but
gets
better
as
you
drink
more
22

bottled

crystal
clear
reddish
copper

with
a
nice
12

dense
khaki
head
with
nice
retention
that
reduces
to
a
good
cap
that
lingers
slight
spotty
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
caramel
toast
biscuit
allspice
nuttiness
and
light

very
nice
and
well
balance
aromas
with
good

very
pleasant
taste
of
pumpkin

biscuit
cinnamon
ginger
nuttiness
and
light
herbal
lingering
notes
of
caramel
biscuit
toast
pumpkin
nuttiness
and
spices
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
flavors
with
a
great
spice
balance
with
no
cloying
flavors
at
all
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
with
nearly
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
imperial
pumpkin
ale
great
flavor
balance
overall
with
just
the
right
amount
of
spices
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
pleasant
and
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
a
bit
over
the
top
nice
pumpkin
pie
flavor
and
it
really
tastes
of
fall
but
its
a
little
too
in
your
face
probably
wouldnt
be
a
bad
beer
to
share
but
drinking
it
solo
isnt
a
wise
decision
overall
pretty
easy
going
down
very
nice
and
tasty
and
the
spcies
with
pumpkin
now
bring
this
beer
to
a
whole
the
bitterness
brought
some
very
tight
flavoring
to
the
sweetness
of
the
pumpkin
malts
i
will
defiantly
drink
again
overall
a
really
unigue
and
interesting
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
the
malt
character
paired
with
the
pumpkin
provides
an
interesting
base
beer
for
the
spices
to
play
off
i
did
think
the
spice
levels
were
a
bit
off
for
what
they
were
going
for
lots
of
ginger
and
allspice
created
a
more
savory
less
sweet
character
to
the
beer
interesting
but
not
something
i
would
buy
regularly
overall
tried
this
in
honor
of
pumpkin
season
and
pleasantly
surprised
its
a
standout
pours
medium
dark
brown
with
some
reddish
hints
light
layer
of
white
foam
malty
smell
mostly
caramel
very
minor
hint
of
nutmeg
some
pumpkin
taste
some
cinammon
not
overloaded
all
flavors
mild
and
blended
smoky
too
real
flavor
here
nicely
done
overall
this
is
a
decent
pumpkinbased
beer
and
its
immediately
obvious
why
sam
adams
chose
to
label
this
as
a
double
pumpkin
beer
the
flavors
are
huge
and
enough
raw
pumpkin
has
entered
the
mix
to
leave
an
oily
sensation
in
the
mouth
after
swallowing
the
spices
are
slightly
overlarge
however
and
the
heavy
alcoholic
burn
does
somewhat
detract
from
the
flavors
and
just
at
the
edges
of
the
beer
is
a
very
raw
pumpkin
flavornot
pumpkin
piecooked
but
raw
straight
from
the
gourdwhich
is
also
offsetting
decent
but
could
have
used
a
bit
more
finetuning
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
despite
its
obvious
flaws
overspiced
overcarbonated
not
as
good
as
dfh
punkin
but
better
than
most
i
have
tried
if
you
enjoy
autumn
spices
give
it
a
whirl
o
i
think
this
may
be
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
and
this
is
my
favorite
style
overall
a
really
great
pumpkin
beer
and
probably
the
best
imperial
variety
i
have
had
just
wish
i
could
find
bottles
of
this
nice
fullbodied
pumpkin
flavor
with
a
rich
array
of
spices
rich
and
creamy
sweetness
makes
for
a
nice
dessert
beer
the
typical
pie
spices
can
be
a
tad
bit
much
as
you
work
through
all
22
ounces
but
theyre
not
as
over
done
as
many
other
pumpkin
beers
can
be
overall
while
many
pumpkin
beers
lack
the
body
to
carry
all
the
flavor
fat
jack
has
a
nice
balance
of
heft
to
hold
up
all
that
is
going
on
but
splitting
the
bottle
might
be
a
good
idea
as
the
richness
can
get
to
you
my
taste
buds
are
introduced
in
a
sweet
fashion
with
dark
malts
and
a
little
nutmeg
and
all
spice
but
after
a
minute
the
moderate
pepperlike
bitterness
kicks
in
and
lingers
briefly
before
pleasantly
fading
out
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
glad
i
could
try
it
on
tap
at
44
stone
overall
not
a
bad
brew
overall
its
obviously
just
a
play
for
the
seasonal
so
its
a
little
overdone
in
that
sense
but
its
still
a
good
tasting
brew
nice
pumpkin
ale
from
sam
adams
better
than
their
harvest
pumpkin
4
0
nice

overall

be

it

o
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
this
will
be
amazing
if
not
then
at
least
you
can
say
you
had
one
not
my
thing
but
if
it
was
i
would
know
i
would
like
this
beer
o
very
rich
beer
but
not
as
much
pumpkin
as
i
would
like
more
of
a
spiced
fall
beer
with
some
pumpkin
undertones
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
like
other
pumpkin
ales
more
o
well
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
pumpkin
ale
but
thats
not
to
say
its
not
a
tasty
beer
the
traditional
spicy
notes
are
subdued
which
i
dont
mind
in
the
least
but
they
are
replaced
by
a
lot
of
roasted
caramel
notes
and
a
finish
that
reminds
me
of
a
strong
ale
or
winter
warmer
i
detect
little
pumpkin
character
in
fat
jack
which
makes
it
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
but
as
a
lightly
spiced
strong
ale
its
not
half
bad
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
its
overly
spiced
with
too
much
cinnamon
but
the
base
is
kind
of
a
winter
warmer
old
ale
with
some
light
roast
and
dark
fruit
that
is
kind
of
cool
and
plays
well
with
the
pumpkin
overall
not
too
shabby
i
wouldnt
say
it
beats
out
pumking
but
this
stuff
is
tasty
and
cheap
get
you
some
batch
1
22oz

the

gradually
collapses
delicate
and
consistent
sheets
of

a
hint
of

and
something
else
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
a
pleasant
toasty
malty
backbone
asserts
itself
and
a
suggestion
of
brown
sugar
also
comes
out
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
a
smooth
and
even
carbonation
and
a
light
oily
texture
theres
almost
a
silkiness
to
it
overall
a
very
enjoyable
pumpkin
beer
flavors
coalesce
nicely
without
being
overly
sweet
or
cloying
a
really
nice
job
for
the
style
i
have
to
say
id
love
to
see
a
variant
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
vegetal
woody
bitterness
up
front
spices
and
malt
move
in
quickly
though
mulled
wine
fruitiness
plums
cherries

with
cinnamon
clove
and

some

flavors
come
through
along
with
a
little
smokiness
finishes
with
lingering
spices
and
fruit
malt
mediumfull
body
with
a
slightly
oily
feel
overall
not
as
pumpkiny
as
say
a
couple
of
better
examples
of
this
style
even
though
the
spices
are
there
still
not
bad
medium
to
full
bodied
with
average
carbonation
there
is
an
aftertaste
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
overall
i
like
this
beer
pretty
well
but
wish
the
spices
would
have
been
toned
down
somewhat
worth
trying
again
overall
good
beer
not
the
most
extravagant
pumpkin
ale
but
definitely
a
keeper
this
autumn
i
really
like
the
pumpkin
ales
the
give
a
zest
that
is
definitely
needed
during
the
season
this
is
definitely
a
top
five
pumpkin
but
at
the
cusp
of
five
drink
up
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
salud
o
not
a
huge
amount
of
pumpkin
flavor
but
still
a
really
good
beer
a
darker
feel
to
it
than
most
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
it
does
need
heavier
pumpkin
and
a
touch
more
spice
as
well
in
the
flavor
overall
a
good
beer
worth
trying
but
i
would
probably
swing
for
a
cheaper
pumpkin
ale
that
tastes
just
as
good
very
tasty
and
worth
a
try
good
beer
room
for
improvement
though
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
deep
vibrant
rubycopper
coloring
almost
blood
colored
with
a
thin
dense
frothy
foamy
offwhite
head
of
a
solid
quarter
of
an
inch
looks
delicious
aromas
of
roasty
sweet
pumpkin
with
a
mild
blending
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
that
smell
like
pumpkin
pie
cooking
in
the
next
room
flavors
are
superrich
with
a
solid
pumpkin
backbone
that
is
roasted
and
sugary
sweet
the
spices
are
highlighting
throughout
in
a
sharp
contrasting
overtone
that
keeps
the
body
from
hitting
the
cloying
mark
on
the
palate
roasty
sweet
and
earthy
aftertaste
with
a
rich
smooth
clean
finish
very
heavy
palate
but
very
flavorful
if
you
like
harvest
andor
pumpkin
beers
this
one
is
worth
a
try
overall
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
to
have
on
a
cloudy
fall
night
though
i
wish
the
pumpkin
was
a
bit
stronger
another
one
of
an
avalanche
of
pumpkin
ales
this
summer
and
i
mean
summer
as
these
started
to
show
up
in
july
i
love
this
style
and
enjoy
trying
as
many
as
i
can
so
its
all
good
this
one
is
quite
good
appearance
is
dark
copper
with
a
healthy
off
white
head
which
persists
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
pumpkin
pie
and
is
its
strongest
feature
the
taste
is
not
as
complex
as
the
aroma
but
decent
malt
forward
followed
by
pumpkin
mouthfeel
doesnt
stand
out
but
average
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
from
a
macromicro
ill
buy
this
one
again
full
in
body
a
little
slick
and
warming
in
the
end
the
spices
pumpkin
and
malt
come
together
well
in
the
flavor
to
give
that
spiced
pumpkin
bread
flavor
i
was
looking
for
the
malt
adds
nice
bready
and
roasty
backbone
here
and
the
abundant
pumpkin
is
definitely
present
in
the
flavor
there
is
some
nice
molasses
type
flavor
adding
some
depth
and
sweetness
here
those
spices
really
come
through
beautifully
in
the
finish
theres
some
pleasant
earthiness
from
the
hops
i
also
pick
up
some
of
the
alcohol
as
well
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
strong
carbonation
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
this
beer
lends
itself
beautifully
to
sipping
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
i
would
try
again
its
definitely
a
step
up
from
harvest
pumpkin
ale
overall
very
enjoyable
seasonal
brew
i
will
buy
this
again
no
questions
asked
deep

scent
of

dark

brown

bready

seasonal

brings

to
the
front
toasted

and
brown

pie
spices
and
actual
pumpkin
quite
muted
slightly
boozy
medium
bodied
decent
pumpkin
needs
a
bit
more
seasonal
kick
from
spices
and
pumpkin
o
its
just
an
ok
pumpkin
ale
not
bad
but
probably
not
worth
the
price
the
feel
has
both
crispness
and
smoothness
but
leans
more
crisp
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
its
got
an
even
carbonation
in
a
medium
body
md
super
sweet
and
super
smooth
maybe
too
sweet
but
the
smoothness
is
nice
and
easy
to
put
back
the
spices
to
me
this
falls
into
the
same
trap
as
most
pumpkin
beers
too
much
spice
not
enough
pumpkin
o
not
something
i
would
want
all
the
time
but
it
good
enough
for
a
great
meal
with
friends
or
family
in
the
colder
months
also
its
a
nice
take
on
the
style
and
is
different
from
a
lot
of
weaker
spice
oriented
pumpkin
ales
cheers
this
is
a
really
delicious
pumpkin
ale
its
not
over
spiced
and
the
pumpkin
comes
through
nicely
theres
a
great
balance
here
that
most
pumpkin
ales
dont
reach
the
caramel
notes
that
come
through
smooth
out
the
spices
and
offer
some
drinkability
the
abv
is
also
well
hidden
i
will
definitely
return
to
this
as
the
fall
season
approaches
this
is
a
really
good
looking
beer
deep
dark
mahogany
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
huge
rocky
light
tan
head
with
lots
of
lace
the
smell
is
dominated
by
the
pie
spices
nutmeg
ginger
cinnamon
sweet
caramel
malt
and
maybe
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
of
the
spices
first
those
are
backed
by
the
malt
which
is
pretty
solid
and
well
rounded
with
everything
from
caramels
to
chocolates
represented
there
is
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
there
as
well
there
is
little
to
nothing
in
the
way
of
hop
flavor
but
the
bitterness
is
there
the
finish
is
relatively
clean
just
a
little
bitter
given
the
heavy
spice
character
the
body
is
quite
full
and
satisfying
and
the
high
alcohol
is
only
very
slightly
evident
at
least
to
start
but
youll
feel
it
near
the
end
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
it
tends
to
lean
on
the
side
of
higher
spiced
versions
but
the
spices
are
supported
by
a
substantial
malt
base
which
makes
it
quite
tasty
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
o
a
good
idea
with
a
fairly
poor
execution
but
at
least
its
mildly
drinkable
sam
adams
makes
quite
a
few
good
brews
this
isnt
one
of
them
to
be
fair
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
nonetheless
wont
be
repeating
this
one
starts
off
as
a
homebrewed
brown
ale
but
there
is
smokiness
that
shows
up
quickly
and
lasts
through
the
aftertaste
thick
body
almost
oily
high
carbonation
i
dont
sense
pumpkin
per
se
but
this
may
be
because
the
beer
doesnt
match
the
typical
pumpkin
pie
profile
i
applaud
this
overall
i
like
the
complexity
when
i
tasted
this
beer
i
did
not
enjoy
it
at
all
i
tasted
very
little
pumpkin
and
more
just
of
smoke
and
some
cinnamon
it
reminded
me
similar
to
the
taste
of
samuel
adams
bonfire
rauchbier
which
tasted
just
smokey
to
me
i
must
say
i
was
disappointed
in
this
one
but
if
you
like
the
smokier
taste
to
beer
then
you
will
probably
enjoy
this
i
did
not
taste
much
pumpkin
in
this
one
compared
to
the
sam
adams
harvest
pumpkin
which
was
disappointing
considering
the
price
and
how
it
was
specially
marketed
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
deep
orange
hue
a
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
head
retention
and
lacing
are
moderate
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
spicy
not
the
best
pumpkin
spice
aroma
but
still
pretty
decent
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
smokey
there
is
a
good
amount
of
smoked
flavors
in
this
one
the
flavors
of
this
are
unique
mostly
because
of
the
incorporation
of
the
smoked
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
has
a
nice
sharp
carbonation
to
it
the
finish
was
sticky
and
dry
overall
its
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
not
my
favorite
though
either

its

you
made
a
terrible
beer
you
sold
me
undrinkable
swill
that
i
poured
into
my
glass
which
now
has
to
be
washed
and
sterilized
so
you
get
nothing
you
lose
good
day
sir
o
i
guess
i
could
have
read
the
label
more
closely
but
i
didnt
notice
the
inclusion
of
smoked
malts
in
this
beer
it
doesnt
completely
overwhelm
the
rest
of
the
flavor
palate
but
in
my
opinion
its
not
a
welcome
addition
to
this
beer
even
taking
the
smokiness
out
this
is
a
simply
average
beer
also
i
learned
that
no
matter
how
good
they
sound
i
think
ive
gotta
stop
drinking
pumpkin
beer
i
just
dont
tend
to
enjoy
them
appearance
is
darker
than
most
pumpkin
ales
a
deep
dark
orange
with
a
generous
2
fingers
of
head
great
retention
with
decent
lacing
nose
is
full
of
pumpkin
spice
with
an
emphasis
on
the
allspice
notes
of
cinnamon
are
present
with
a
touch
of
the
actual
pumpkin
in
the
background
the
taste
takes
an
unexpected
turn
the
malt
profile
overshadows
the
pumpkin
qualities
that
were
present
on
the
nose
lots
of
caramel
malts
are
there
along
with
mellow
cinnamon
character
no
pumpkin
present
on
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
high
carbonation
i
must
say
i
had
high
hopes
after
smelling
this
brew
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
o
this
is
what
i
think
pumpkin
beers
should
be
like
not
overspiced
with
fake
stuff
and
a
little
pumpkin
but
big
and
meaty
with
plenty
of
pumpkin
to
give
this
kind
of
heartiness
and
then
a
little
bit
of
spice
for
the
sake
of
the
season
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
new
favorite
pumpkin
beers
dont
expect
one
of
those
novelty
pumpkin
pie
beers
either
because
this
is
definitely
not
it
dark
cherrycolored
beer
with
a
thick
head
of
foam
the
color
of
pumpkin
seeds
aromas
of
spice
dough
and
pumpkin
smells
very
much
like
a
pumpkin
pie
tastes
of
sweetened
pumpkin
and
light
spices
with
notes
of
doughy
bread
and
leafy
vegetables
the
spices
that
appear
so
strongly
in
its
aroma
dont
carry
over
in
the
flavor
still
this
is
an
excellent
autumn
beer
clear
beautiful
mahogany
below
a
slim
patchy
white
head
subtle
spiced
aroma
ginger
nutmeg
allspice
the
typical
pumpkin
pie
spice
blend
a
little
fruity
tartness
pops
up
as
well
lots
of
toasty
caramel
flavors
pie
spices
dark
fruit
and
sweet
bread
lightly
warming
on
the
way
down
but
never
boozy
very
smooth
and
on
the
verge
of
full
bodied
not
exactly
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
but
i
like
that
the
spices
arent
overdone
good
effort
o
a
very
well
done
pumpkin
beer
i
find
that
these
usually
go
one
of
two
ways
either
really
good
or
really
bad
this
one
is
in
the
really
good
category
the
pumpkin
and
spices
make
it
taste
like
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
o
a
really
well
rounded
pumpkin
ale
quite
delicious
o
its
not
horrible
just
strange
balance
of
flavors
pumpkin
is
completely
drowned
out
by
unusually
strong
and
uncomplimentary
spices
in
the
middle
most
pumpkin
beers
are
very
spice
heavy
but
at
least
they
compliment
the
flavor
this
is
more
of
a
herbedspiced
beer
than
a
pumpkin
ale
just
doesnt
work
for
me
unfortunately
overall
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
and
the
alcohol
is
mostly
felt
between
sips
and
more
so
as
it
warms
the
spice
flavor
is
good
and
i
do
get
the
pumkin
meat
but
i
feel
that
a
touch
more
sweetness
would
really
make
nice
difference
and
would
really
give
the
effect
of
a
pumpkin
ale
vs
more
of
a
spiced
ale
definitely
worth
a
try
but
a
pumking
it
is
not
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
mug
this
beer
has
a
nice
rustyorange
color
with
aroung
half
a
finger
of
creamcolored
head
great
smell
that
promised
lots
of
pumpkiny
goodness
the
flavor
was
a
little
disappointing
though
this
really
should
be
called
pumpkin
spice
and
not
really
pumpkin
since
the
nutmeg
was
soooo
powerful
otherwise
nice
malty
sweetness
and
good
finish
ill
probably
revisit
this
one
around
the
holidays
but
i
wont
miss
it
if
i
cant
find
it
overall
a
good
addition
to
the
pumpkin
scene
glad
sam
adams
stepped
it
up
a
little
and
released
this
in
compliment
to
their
regular
harvest
pumpkin
always
been
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
good
not
must
have
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
this
is
more
of
a
beerbeer
poured
a
1
25
beige
head
of
medium
life
the
clear
body
is
deep
burnt
sienna
brown
in
masstone
but
held
to
the
light
its
actually
a
very
deep
winey
amber
color
smells
mildly
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
the
taste
carries
less
of
the
pie
spice
than
the
smell
suggested
and
instead
is
a
rich
malt
body
and
mouthfeel
are
full
and
rich
quite
nice

randomly
at

topped
by
a

taste
with

the

flavor
is
a

but
quite
unique
which
gives
it
some
points
a
good
beer
overall
pumking
is
a
fantastic
brew
the
taste
of
pumpkin
is
very
evident
but
not
overpowering
normally
i
am
not
a
fan
of
flavored
beers
like
this
but
it
is
done
quite
well
absolutely
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
its
outstanding
i
tasted
it
once
and
fell
in
love
with
it
no
other
pumpkin
beer
can
hold
a
candle
every
year
the
abv
drops
they
brew
more
and
more
and
of
course
the
price
goes
up
boooo
southern
tier
once
great
beer
is
lost
in
the
shuffle
with
the
hundreds
of
other
pumpkin
beers
very
strong
pumpkin
flavor
a
little
too
malty
for
my
liking
bitter
heavy
pumpkin
taste
and
aftertaste
with
alcohol
too
prominent
overall
this
was
poured
from
a
bomber
and
was
quite
good
but
when
i
had
as
a
draft
in
the
fall
it
was
great
probably
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
maybe
a
slightly
biased
review
but
i
do
love
this
beer
my
favorite
out
of
everything
i
have
had
actually
one
of
the
few
beers
i
get
really
excited
to
come
out
and
that
i
will
actively
seek
out
i
tend
to
only
try
new
things
and
pumpking
is
definitely
a
huge
exception
best
pumpkin
beer
of
them
all
idk

time
trying
this

you
can

they

it
had

almost
like

maybe
it
was

liked
what

it

enough
that

the
flavors
are
not
melding
and
as
a
result
this
is
not
very
enjoyable
i
cant
say
that
about
too
many
brews
i
thought
it
was
odd
that
southern
tier
out
of
the
blue
decided
to
ship
to
the
arizona
market
for
the
first
time
kind
of
wonder
if
they
dumped
a
bad
batch
arizcardsoct
03
that
then
flows
into
a
smash
in
the
face
of
the
aforementioned
spices
clove
takes
the
lead
in
the
middle
and
slowly
fades
into
a
vanilla
note
over
a
rich
biscuit
and
bready
sweetness
the
finish
is
smooth
and
a
blend
of
the
flavors
linger
against
a
nice
mild
alcohol
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat

overall
thus
far
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
id
love
to
try
one
fresh
and
in
season
as
i
believe
in
season
may
have
a
placebo
effect
my
brain
will
tell
me
its
better
in
october
or
november
just
because
it
must
be
tough
to
brew
a
good
pumpkin
ale
because
i
have
tasted
so
many
bad
ones
there
are
none
better
than
southern
tier
pumking
the
aroma
has
big
bready
malts
up
front
with
a
good
amount
of
pumpkin
to
back
it
up
it
smells
almost
like
zucchini
bread
with
a
bit
of
a
sweet
corn
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
has
more
of
the
pumpkin
up
front
with
the
malts
taking
a
back
seat
tons
of
cinnamon
and
clove
come
through
as
well
and
the
higher
alcohol
content
makes
itself
apparent
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chewy
so
this
beer
is
kind
of
like
a
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
this
is
a
must
try
during
the
autumn
months
its
one
of
my
go
tos
o
this
is
a
beer
i
buy
every
year
once
it
is
released
and
it
is
great
every
time
drinkability
better
than
most
for
its
style
one
of
my
favorites
as
pumpkin
beers
go
this
is
the
gold
standard
my
wife
says
its
like
a
pumpkin
pie
without
the
crust
shes
right
the
beer
does
have
more
of
a
dessert
feel
with
its
creamy
finish
limited
release
every
year
is
worth
the
wait
every
october
sometimes
difficult
to
find
in
in
the
pa
ny
region
its
produced
stock
up
if
you
can
have
had
this
one
a
couple
times
great
notes
of
pumpkin
and
a
yammy
finish
its
a
deserty
beer
one
that
youd
drink
just
1
or
2
of
i
feel
but
really
enjoy
them
after
having
it
on
draft
and
in
a
bottle
its
good
either
way
1
of
my
favorite
beers
the
hype
is
deserved
as
this
is
the
most
pumpkinny
of
the
fall
beers
ive
tried
its
not
the
best
tho
ill
take
indeeds
yamma
jamma
over
this
any
day
unlike
some
pumpkin
beers
pumking
isnt
just
in
your
face
candylike
pumpkin
spice
flavors
nor
is
it
too
malty
you
get
nice
notes
of
the
pumpkin
spices
but
you
do
taste
something
slightly
vegetabley
and
earthy
as
well
almost
a
true
pumpkin
squash
flavor
its
one
of
the
few
pumpkin
beers
i
drink
on
multiple
occasions
over
the
fall
over
all
in
my
opinion
a
fantastic
beer
i
am
a
very
big
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
and
in
my
opinion
this
one
beats
all
others
it
was
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
white
head
i
have
never
tried
this
beer
on
tap
only
in
the
bottle
but
i
would
recommend
it
to
any
pumpkin
beer
lover
o
i
dont
understand
why
people
look
forward
to
the
novelty
of
drinking
the
simulacrum
of
a
seasonal
dish
rather
than
eating
the
real
thing
i
suspect
having
9
months
to
forget
how
regrettable
it
actually
is
has
something
to
do
with
it
but
also
the
willingness
of
folks
to
buy
into
the
idea
of
a
beer
representing
picturesque
pumpkin
pickings
and
redolent
autumnal
vistas
that
it
cant
possibly
deliver
on
shouldnt
be
discounted
either
overall
not
to
my
taste
tastes
nutty
and
spicy
but
not
very
good
ended
up
with
indigestion
later
different
than
most
pumpkin
beers
because
the
pumpkin
spices
seemed
to
be
absent
o
4
25
great
beer
perfect
representation
of
a
pumpkin
beer
i
think
most
october
beers
could
learn
from
this
one
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
high
gravity
pumpkin
beer
as
opposed
to
2003
bells
eccentric
ale
a
very
bad
example
of
a
high
gravity
pumpkin
beer
overall
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
the
spices
were
too
dominating
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
more
if
not
for
that
so
smooth
and
flavorful
not
at
all
too
sweet
a
whole
bottle
does
whack
you
pretty
good
but
its
delicious
with
the
right
feel
and
burst
of
spices
i
think
its
as
good
in
the
bottle
as
it
is
fresh
on
tap
but
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
does
after
aging
a
couple
more
months
so
solid
and
consistent
goes
great
with
food
or
as
desert
overall
a
solid
beer
ive
seen
people
suggest
that
warlock
is
just
pumking
with
more
bitter
roasted
components
and
im
inclined
to
agree
if
i
want
a
pure
pumpkin
beer
rather
than
a
pumpkin
stout
or
something
there
are
others
that
im
likely
to
reach
for
first
however
this
one
is
pretty
solid
and
worth
a
try
for
anyone
who
hasnt
sampled
it
before
othis
beer
is
what
every
other
brewer
is
trying
to
become
cant
believe
abv
its
hidden
well
o
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
is
it
stays
true
to
the
style
of
the
beer
when
it
says
pumpkin
that
is
what
i
want
to
taste
its
not
masked
up
with
pie
spices
and
fake
flavors
this
one
is
as
pumpkin
as
it
gets
this
is
quite
a
different
october
brew
it
is
heavy
in
pumpkin
spice
and
can
be
initially
delicious
but
it
goes
down
like
a
soft
drink
sodapopcolawhatever
the
yankees
call
it
im
on
the
fence
with
that
feeling
the
alcohol
is
almost
not
detectable
in
the
aroma
or
taste
to
myself
beers
body
is
mediumheavy
to
medium
with
carbonation
in
a
range
of
medium
to
mediumhigh
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
borders
fizzy
but
never
quite
reaches
it
resulting
in
a
smooth
foamy
mouthfeel
overall
the
carbonation
complements
the
bodys
thickness
quite
nicely
the
beer
is
quite
pleasant
on
the
palate
finish
is
dry
and
leaves
a
lingering
dryness
and
substantial
sweetness
on
the
palate
compelling
another
sip
od
great
drinkabiliity
lovely
pumpkin
element
that
really
worked
i
dont
typically
enjoy
pumpkin
beers
but
i
love
pumpkin
pie
and
this
did
it
for
me
a
really
neat
beer
the
beer
tastes
like
a
liquid
pumpkin
pie
pours
from
the
22oz
bottle
a
light
copper
color
with
a
1
12
finger
slightly
offwhite
head
lively
carbonation
is
observed
there
are
quite
a
few
bubbles
rising
in
the
glass
the
room
is
almost
overwhelmed
with
the
aroma
of
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
etc
and
a
sweet
caramellike
aroma
a
slight
aroma
of
pumpkin
is
picked
up
1st
sip
brings
a
dry
dose
of
the
aforementioned
spices
a
little
too
dry
for
my
tastes
this
could
use
some
more
malt
or
maybe
a
hint
of
brown

not
my
favorite
beer
i
rarely
if
ever
stop
drinking
a
beer
and
get
rid
of
it
but
i
did
this
time
in
my
opinion
there
is
just
too
much
going
on
here
in
this
brew
and
most
of
it
is
not
to
my
liking
this
halloween
pumpkin
beer
was
certainly
all
trick
and
no
treat
for
me
ill
never
look
at
pepe
lopez
the
same
way
i
really
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
after
reading
so
much
about
it
but
it
came
up
short
i
got
an
overwhelming
amount
of
graham
cracker
in
the
aroma
and
the
alcohol
was
just
too
up
front
it
was
an
easy
drinker
though
and
the
colour
was
true
to
style
the
hops
take
a
back
seat
to
the
malt
but
i
would
have
liked
less
graham
cracker
aroma
and
taste
less
vanilla
more
spices
the
pumpkin
was
there
in
the
background
as
well
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
beers
with
so
much
going
on
that
personal
tastes
really
come
into
play
a
few
tweaks
here
and
there
and
i
would
have
loved
it
but
then
it
would
have
been
a
different
beer
worth
a
try
poured
into
an
english
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
very
light
orange
color
with
a
small
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
away
to
just
a
film
the
aroma
offered
is
very
nice
sweet
malt
with
a
subtle
spicy
mix
where
no
one
component
really
dominatesi
can
pick
out
nutmeg
but
barelythe
blend
is
really
nice
the
flavor
continues
the
perfect
blend
of
spices
though
it
borders
on
being
too
sweet
for
me
there
nice
vanilla
notes
i
didnt
pick
up
in
the
nose
theres
some
bitterness
at
the
end
but
overall
its
on
the
sweet
side
the
body
is
delightfully
light
for
the
strength
personally
id
appreciate
a
smallersized
bottle
but
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
o
this
beer
made
me
believe
that
pumpkin
ales
are
worth
my
consideration
my
first
two
pumpkin
ales
were
shipyard
vomit
and
blue
moon
blech
then
i
had
terrapin
pumpkinfest
and
it
was
better
than
the
aforementioned
abominations
but
it
didnt
convert
me
either
this
offering
may
have
made
me
a
convert
o
definitely
in
my
top
3
pumpkin
beers
arguably
my
favorite
it
has
so
much
complexity
and
depth
of
character
it
is
truly
one
of
a
kind
a
highly
recommended
seasonal
favorite
i
think
pumpkin
beers
just
may
not
be
for
me
pale
golden
colored
with
minimal
head
that
vanishes
quickly
great
clarity
with
low
carbonation
i
get
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
clove
the
flavor
is
aggressively
spiced
in
a
similar
fashion
to
the
warlock
that
i
had
just
tried
but
the
baseline
beer
is
much
lighter
in
body
this
is
an
aggressively
spiced
pumpkin
brew
that
offers
a
lot
of
flavor
pumpkin
with
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
is
what
you
get
with
the
taste
i
really
wish
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
for
thanksgiving
or
something
this
far
less
sweet
than
i
expected
and
the
notes
of
spices
and
slight
vegetal
character
as
well
as
the
creamy
mouthfeel
made
this
a
unique
drinking
experience
as
far
as
offerings
in
the
style
go
id
gladly
have
another
maybe
ontap
but
its
definitely
recommended
to
split
i
split
every
bomber
i
buy
anyways
but
this
is
definitely
something
that
wouldnt
be
the
worst
idea
to
offer
in
4
or
6
packs
for
the
sake
of
practical
drinking
o
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
this
makes
a
real
nice
desert
beer
nice
potently
spicy
pumpkin
ale
one
of
the
spicier
around
not
actually
my
favorite
feel
like
the
spices
over
ride
the
actual
beer
qualities
overall
best
pumpkin
beer
our
therewhat
better
day
to
enjoy
then
on
halloween
delicious
among
my
favorites
of
the
style
o
great
beer
the
aroma
is
to
die
for
i
really
love
it
even
if
i
compare
it
to
carrot
cake
has
anyone
made
a
carrot
cake
beer
aftertaste
is
my
only
knock
on
this
beer
overall
while
i
have
limited
experience
with
pumpkin
ales
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
ive
had
this
season
and
truly
wonderful
with
intense
flavors
and
aromas
however
other
buyers
seem
to
have
caught
on
since
when
i
went
back
to
a
location
that
supposedly
still
had
inventory
they
were
all
gone
will
keep
looking
for
this
marvelous
beer
in
hopes
that
i
could
try
it
once
again
cigar
city
have
not
tried
is
really
the
only
contender
imo
to
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
spices
dont
overpower
the
crust
element
is
very
enjoyable
and
its
just
a
good
beer
overall
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
thin
tan
head
massive
aromas
of
eggnog
and
nutmeg
taste
begins
with
some
some
huge
cinnamon
then
some
pumpkin
followed
by
some
cream
the
finish
is
a
spicy
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
a
very
flavorful
pumpkin
ale
o
it
seems
to
be
trying
to
emulate
a
pumpkin
pie
but
it
lacks
the
savory
depth
that
dish
provides
and
just
hits
sweet
hard
and
often
happy
halloween
the
aroma
stuke
me
as
the
most
interesting
part
of
this
beer
almonds
cookies
and
indian
cuisine
we
flavours
in
this
strong
pumpkin
beer
in
the
taste
these
elemants
were
there
to
but
way
less
than
in
the
aroma
orange
collored
and
a
thin
layer
of
foam
if
it
was
possible
i
would
have
snifted
this
one
instead
of
drinking
it
overall
this
beer
is
probably
a
onetime
novelty
for
me
a
tasty
substitute
for
dessert
but
hardly
a
true
beer
o
i
was
skeptical
buying
this
beer
for
8
living
up
to
the
hype
this
blew
my
understanding
of
what
you
could
do
with
pumpkin
in
beers
and
is
the
1
must
buy
for
the
season
so
far
if
you
can
find
it
buy
it
in
bulk
to
share
with
those
friends
that
appreciate
a
good
beer
the
taste
tones
it
down
a
little
bit
with
the
caramel
malts
and
hops
certainly
more
noticeable
than
on
the
nose
dont
get
it
twisted
this
is
not
a
hoppy
beer
by
any
means
just
that
i
didnt
really
notice
it
on
the
nose
but
it
is
here
somewhat
in
the
flavour
the
sweet
pumpkin
pie
still
drives
this
beer
as
well
it
should
creamy
and
round
its
surprisingly
drinkable
and
the
8
6
is
well
covered
not
entirely
surprisingly
i
liked
warlock
better
i
adore
big
creamy
stouts
but
this
is
a
top
tier
no
pun
intended
autumnal
liquid
reading
the
admonishments
that
it
wasnt
as
good
as
last
year
nothing
ever
is
is
it
had
me
slightly
worried
but
having
never
tasted
last
years
this
stands
on
its
own
as
an
extremely
enjoyable
beverage
experience
o
a
great
interesting
pumpkin
beer
its
great
in
small
doses
the
alcohol
really
hit
me
i
prefer
schlaflys
but
id
definitely
hit
this
up
again
and
will
look
forward
to
this
on
a
yearly
basis
the
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
vanilla
was
obvious
and
inviting
and
the
taste
matched
the
expectations
that
were
set
by
the
smell
the
vanilla
added
a
smooth
and
creamy
feeling
that
was
not
overtaken
by
the
high
alcohol
content
on
a
fall
night
this
beer
is
a
fine
way
to
start
and
end
an
evening
o
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
to
me
i
like
my
pumpkin
beers
meatier
and
not
quite
as
sweet
this
is
very
good
though
and
makes
for
a
wonderful
dessert
beer
onot
only
tastiest
pumpkin
beer
around
its
one
of
the
better
tasting
brews
period
smell
is
a
work
of
art
if
pumking
looked
and
felt
better
this
beer
would
be
a
whale
look
and
feel
are
great
mind
you
but
get
pushed
aside
by
the
amazing
smell
and
taste
pours
as
unpunintended
as
this
can
get
a
warm
pumpkin
orange
with
about
a
pinky
of
white
head
aroma
is
graham
crackers
vanilla
cinnamon
and
of
course
pumpkin
the
taste
is
creamy
vanilla
and
cinnamon
rounded
out
with
a
bit
of
biscuity
malt
and
slightly
bitter
hops
with
a
surprisingly
light
nonsticky
mouth
feel
ive
read
plenty
of
evaluations
decrying
this
beer
as
having
gone
way
down
in
quality
ive
even
seen
the
term
undrinkable
used
but
to
me
its
still
a
damn
sight
better
than
just
about
every
other
beer
of
its
type
out
there
o
not
a
poor
beer
but
im
disappointed
ive
read
from
other
reviews
that
the
recipe
for
this
years
version
may
have
been
changed
im
assuming
thats
correct
as
this
is
a
highly
reviewed
beer
but
more
recent
reviews
havent
been
as
kind
the
pumpkin
taste
is
artificial
and
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
yet
thin
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
if
it
were
offered
for
free
but
ill
never
purchase
again
o
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
its
one
i
get
excited
to
drink
for
both
the
flavor
and
the
time
of
the
year
it
signifies
delicious
taste
beautiful
color
o
overall
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
very
enjoyable
for
the
time
of
the
year
o
so
far
my
favorite
its
got
good
body
and
spice
and
pumpkin
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
reviewed
this
year
i
wouldnt
mind
just
a
little
more
malt
backing
and
maybe
just
a
little
less
ibus
but
this
is
labeled
as
an
imperial
and
i
think
they
hit
the
mark
pretty
much
right
on
great
beer
guys
i
would
definitely
go
back
for
seconds
i
heard
a
lot
that
this
beer
was
liquid
pumkin
pie
to
me
it
has
a
nice
beer
base
which
dosent
get
overthrown
by
the
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
lighter
on
the
color
nice
head
good
carbonation
good
and
hoppy
fresh
tasting
and
well
balanced
its
by
far
not
a
bad
choice
and
shouldnt
dissapoint
atmosphere
is
really
nice
only
a
minimal
head
and
very
little
lacing
nose
is
an
excellent
combination
of
pumpkin
and
fall
spices
a
little
bitter
and
a
little
sweet
pumpkin
and
butterscotch
accentuated
with
some
fall
spice
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
completely
different
from
schlafly
and
alewerks
but
so
amazing
lives
up
to
the
hype
delicious
o
a
great
pumpkin
and
fall
beer
it
has
the
perfect
amount
of
pumpkin
to
it
and
goes
down
very
smooth
will
be
picking
up
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
overall
the
beer
is
smooth
creamy
complex
and
drinks
easy
a
great
beer
this
beer
has
a
somewhat
sticky
mouthfeel
id
like
a
bigger
malt
body
to
go
with
the
pumpkin
spice
somehow
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
but
it
is
the
best
pumpkin
ive
ever
tried
i
knew
id
be
okay
just
because
it
was
from
southern
tier
pours
orange
with
a
big
white
head
that
disappears
sweet
vanilla
cookies
on
the
nose
some
rose
blossom
hibiscus
very
little
noticeable
carbonation
theres
quite
a
bit
going
on
tastewise
though
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
muted
instead
theres
a
good
deal
of
sweetness
up
front
plus
coriander
cardamon
basil
more
vanilla
some
white
pepper
and
an
aftertaste
that
reminds
me
of
being
sick
and
spoonfed
benadryl
or
old
cough
syrup
theres
a
medicinal
bitterness
and
tang
eucalyptus
anise
which
lingers
too
long
for
my
taste
its
nicely
balanced
beer
in
terms
of
its
body
with
subtle
carbonation
im
not
too
sure
what
makes
this
a
pumpkin
ale
other
than
its
orange
color
and
that
the
label
says
ale
brewed
with
pumpkins
a
spiced
fall
ale
perhaps
heck
it
even
has
some
qualities
of
a
winter
ale
a
mixed
bag
overall
fantastic
and
boldly
flavored
no
lack
of
flavor
at
all
strong
pumpkin
pie
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
reminiscent
of
whipped
cream
topping
great
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
spice
flavor
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
brings
it
all
together
to
avoid
it
becoming
cloying
however
i
still
highly
suggest
this
beer
o
this
is
a
very
solid
pumpkin
ale
in
the
imperial
style
i
like
the
fact
that
there
is
some
punch
with
the
alcohol
bought
a
bottle
at
table
and
vine
in
west
springfield
ma
attractive
goldamber
appearance
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
thin
creamy
head
aromas
are
incredibly
strong
to
the
point
of
a
bit
overwhelming
a
definitive
sweet
smell
of
pumpkin
strong
cinnamon
maybe
a
little
vanilla
if
the
aromas
were
just
taken
down
a
notch
a
bit
it
may
have
been
less
overwhelming
otherwise
these
are
mouthwatering
aromas
the
taste
was
dessert
level
sweetness
i
liked
it
though
i
can
see
how
some
might
be
taken
very
aback
by
how
sweet
this
is
definitely
could
taste
a
strong
baked
pumpkin
pastry
flavor
to
the
beer
as
well
as
that
vanilla
i
sensed
a
bit
from
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
what
perfectly
supplements
this
beer
as
a
very
sweet
dessertlike
beer
to
have
after
supper
this
was
a
very
creamy
drink
with
a
medium
carbonation
that
adds
to
that
flavor
quite
well
so
if
you
want
a
dessertlike
seasonal
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
usually
i
find
southern
tier
beers
quite
good
and
i
hope
that
this
was
a
bottle
issue
rather
than
this
beer
i
may
give
it
another
shot
and
rereview
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
this
style
but
i
did
enjoy
this
one
has
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
that
work
well
together
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
making
this
one
drinkable
and
dangerous
this
is
my
first
beer
from
this
brewer
and
i
am
anxious
to
try
more
from
them
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
much
better
than
the
first
time
that
i
had
it
as
far
as
big
pumpkin
ales
go
this
is
a
solid
candidate
it
has
enough
of
a
different
slant
in
the
flavor
to
perk
the
senses
and
then
back
it
with
a
pretty
well
built
beer
the
initial
taste
is
a
bit
too
sweet
i
found
but
it
has
a
lot
of
different
levels
to
it
which
is
cool
lots
of
richness
and
a
sweet
roasty
character
pumpkin
flavor
is
very
apparent
with
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
but
also
has
a
quite
a
bit
of
complexity
to
it
worth
trying
4
o
not
potent
but
very
drinkable
smooth
creamy
sweet
and
spicy
i
could
definitely
enjoy
another
mit
doesnt
wreck
you
palatte
like
a
hoppy
ipa
but
the
aftertaste
when
fresh
pretty
amazing
overall
given
the
trendy
appeal
of
pumpkin
beers
and
the
frequency
of
which
theyre
produced
poorly
this
is
probably
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
just
on
the
authentic
pie
like
smell
alone
although
the
strong
wash
of
alcohol
kind
of
takes
away
from
the
satisfying
sweet
pumpkin
experience
overall
a
well
crafted
and
unique
fall
beer
ill
continue
to
look
forward
to
it
every
fall
overall
when
it
comes
to
pumpkin
beers
this
is
the
king
for
a
reason
insane
level
of
pumpkinspice
flavor
if
it
wasnt
for
that
lingering
alcohol
heat
this
would
be
out
of
this
world
pours
a
darker
yellowburnt
orange
in
color
that
is
slightly
hazy
very
thin
white
head
that
leaves
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
of
fresh
cut
pumpkins
hits
you
right
up
front
with
some
grainshop
very
nice
actually
the
taste
was
fantastic
perfect
balance
of
flavor
no
harsh
aftertaste
either
as
one
might
think
with
the
high
alcohol
content
overall
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
out
there
i
tried
love
this
time
of
year
with
all
the
autumn
brews
the
one
draw
is
that
the
feel
is
sharp
thin
and
tinged
with
alcohol
nicely
crisp
but
a
touch
abrasive
this
could
use
a
bit
of
thickness
solid
nose
of
fresh
pumpkin
pie
all
thats
missing
is
the
freshly
whipped
cream
taste
is
nicely
toasted
malts
that
suggest
a
thick
completely
baked
pie
crust
in
the
finish
a
touch
of
light
caramel
and
the
spices
from
the
nose
most
notably
nutmeg
followed
by
some
ginger
and
just
a
touch
of
cinnamon
perfect
to
serve
with
thanksgiving
dessert
poured
gently
into
a
brandy
snifter
very
light
and
average
sized
head
the
hype
for
this
beer
seems
to
be
mostly
placed
on
the
smell
and
indeed
it
somehow
captures
the
most
pleasant
and
creamy
aspects
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
first
sip
was
nearly
all
vanilla
with
a
touch
of
spice
but
the
proceeding
sips
are
increasingly
complex
with
english
ale
more
spices
and
even
a
touch
of
raw
pumpkin
meat
drawing
me
in
as
with
the
smell
i
immediately
and
consistently
got
an
exceptionally
smooth
and
creamy
texture
its
almost
too
drinkable
considering
the
the
complex
flavors
and
high
abv
pumking
is
a
different
kind
of
sipper
due
to
the
candy
like
flavor
and
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
a
special
occasion
in
and
of
itself
glad
i
got
to
finally
try
this
i
often
tell
people
pumking
is
my
favorite
beer
of
any
style
hands
down
even
though
im
a
hop
head
this
is
one
that
i
store
so
we
can
have
a
triple
vertical
every
thanksgiving
along
with
my
pumpkin
pie
it
ages
in
an
odd
and
inconsistent
way
the
booziness
advances
and
retreats
with
time
as
does
the
pumpkin
flavor
its
arguable
whether
its
better
after
the
pumpkin
spice
pulls
back
a
little
but
what
isnt
is
that
its
absolutely
amazing
when
fresh
its
all
about
the
spice
and
the
vanilla
notes
just
like
my
pumpkin
pie
with
the
pumpkin
crouching
in
the
background
but
dont
bother
drinking
it
with
a
cold
the
wonderful
aroma
is
90
responsible
for
the
great
taste
overall
i
think
the
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
is
worth
buying
once
or
twice
a
year
even
though
it
is
a
bit
expensive
this
beer
is
something
to
write
home
about
im
not
a
beer
expert
i
just
have
a
good
palate
i
know
that
everyone
who
tastes
it
loves
it
i
like
the
finish
when
the
oxygen
hits
your
mouth
after
you
swallow
the
beer
is
only
sold
in
large
bottles
i
think
that
is
to
make
sure
you
pour
in
a
bottle
however
it
could
also
be
to
make
sure
you
have
a
good
time
great
tasting
beer
with
a
abv
of
8
6
you
cant
go
wrong
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
so
far
no
need
for
that
caramel
sugar
rim
to
enhance
flavor
not
overly
sweet
just
enough
spice
this
is
the
seasonal
beer
you
want
to
be
drinking
you
can
find
it
on
tap
at
the
village
traven
in
salem
ma
light
carbonation
lends
itself
to
a
flavor
thats
not
naturally
assertive
i
buy
a
case
of
this
when
it
comes
out
and
split
it
with
another
friend
of
mine
who
is
obsessed
with
it
its
definitely
drinkable
and
definitely
has
some
good
flavor
but
i
do
feel
its
a
bit
overhyped
pouring
it
out
of
the
22
is
nice
and
adds
to
the
enjoyment
drink
it
from
a
goblet
as
directed
the
taste
is
excellent
for
pumpkins
especially
ones
high
on
the
abv
one
of
the
best
the
viscosity
is
a
little
thin
and
there
is
subtle
changes
only
after
a
little
bit
of
warming
but
overall
this
is
outstanding
autumn
brew
from
a
22oz
bomber
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
rich
tan
head
immediately
picked
up
more
of
a
sweet
biscuit
than
traditional
pumpkin
pie
spice
on
the
nose
the
mouth
feel
is
full
and
again
i
get
a
dominating
vanilla
cookie
flavor
and
subtle
pumpkin
pie
spice
with
a
nice
alcohol
warmth
i
have
friends
who
are
nuts
about
this
brew
but
it
was
too
sweet
and
almost
cloying
for
me
o
smell
leads
you
to
believe
that
you
are
getting
a
sweet
spice
bomb
but
the
taste
is
really
nice
let
down
by
the
watery
mouthfeel
i
wont
be
asking
for
this
again
i
prefer
dogfish
heads
punkin
ale
because
its
more
vegetal
and
less
dessertscented
this
beer
would
be
great
for
someone
who
doesnt
mind
a
sweeter
beer
with
some
artificial
notes
sadly
i
was
not
impressed
despite
all
of
the
good
recommendations
strong
caramel
maltiness
on
the
nose
a
bit
of
pumpkin
and
the
usual
accouterments
of
spices
nutmeg
ginger
cinnamon
etc
overly
sweet
i
got
more
spices
on
my
tongue
when
i
took
some
sips
the
caramel
malt
and
the
pumpkin
dont
go
well
together
and
i
think
the
hops
add
a
strange
off
note
the
pumpkin
finishes
quickly
leaving
the
spices
and
that
sickly
sweet
taste
i
got
so
strongly
on
the
nose
and
the
odd
hop
off
taste
an
outstanding
job
served
in
a
tulip
glass
chilled
appearance
was
mildly
cloudy
bright
orange
amber
color
with
a
wonderful
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
aroma
smooth
clean
refreshing
i
had
the
white
gourmet
pizza
and
the
combination
worked
well
the
taste
was
true
pumpkin
with
a
nice
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
undertone
perhaps
the
day
in
the
sun
visiting
every
animal
display
yes
every
one
set
me
up
to
enjoy
any
cold
beverage
but
i
do
not
think
so
this
was
a
delightful
beer
that
i
would
recommend
a
subsequent
purchase
of
the
same
in
a
bottle
produced
a
less
enthusiastic
but
still
positive
experience
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
sweet
cheeks
outside
fenway
park
last
night
it
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
sent
back
to
me
it
tasted
just
like
i
would
imagine
a
fenway
park
urinal
would
taste
try
it
for
yourself
i
handed
the
beer
around
the
table
and
3
of
my
friends
agreed
with
me
it
has
an
articial
sweet
mintiness
that
overwhelmed
any
subtle
pumpkin
notes
though
one
of
my
friends
actually
thought
it
was
decent
tasting
pie
which
i
see
some
other
reviewers
also
noted
o
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
southern
tier
strikes
again
the
balance
between
the
pumpkin
and
the
graham
cracker
make
this
beer
a
great
seasonal
choice
pours
out
a
bright
coppery
orange
with
a
thin
head
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
and
graham
crackers
thats
it
it
smells
amazing
the
spices
dont
hit
me
over
the
head
as
much
as
i
would
have
expected
which
is
a
good
thing
i
pick
up
some
pumpkin
along
with
the
baking
spice
so
it
isnt
too
hidden
fairly
sweet
overall
which
seems
appropriate
finishes
with
a
surprising
and
welcome
bitterness
i
get
some
of
that
graham
cracker
in
there
too
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
and
the
carbonation
isnt
too
lively
delicious
beer
dessert
in
a
glass
ive
tried
several
pumpkin
varieties
and
this
particular
variety
is
suitably
labeled
this
is
simply
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
very
flavorful
without
being
over
the
board
regarding
the
pumpkin
flavors
the
pumpkin
pie
spice
flavors
come
through
beautifully
sip
this
one
and
savor
it
do
a
very
seasonal
representation
of
shv
beer
that
pumpkin
enthusiasts
would
enjoy
it
may
not
necessarily
offer
anything
different
than
other
commercial
examples
but
it
seems
to
employ
a
variety
of
what
the
rest
do
o
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
one
of
the
34
i
look
for
not
something
i
can
drink
everyday
but
what
pumpkin
ale
is
not
sure
if
its
quite
as
good
as
a
few
ive
had
but
its
sure
as
heck
better
than
nearly
most
ive
had
pumking
is
definitely
something
i
buy
every
year
and
remains
a
part
of
my
halloween
party
lineup
a
real
classic
fall
seasonal
really
good
beer
would
definitely
drink
again
very
nice
overall
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
wasnt
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
feel
like
this
was
more
of
a
dessert
beer
version
of
the
style
but
the
problem
was
the
sweetness
and
spices
covered
up
most
of
those
natural
pumpkin
flavors
and
that
seemed
to
really
hurt
this
beer
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
somewhat
smooth
and
not
filling
but
the
flavor
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
half
a
bomber
is
more
than
enough
for
me
theres
no
way
i
would
want
to
drink
a
whole
bomber
to
myself
it
would
be
way
too
much
and
i
dont
think
i
could
do
it
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
they
both
worked
well
with
this
beer
and
the
appearance
was
pretty
good
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
over
the
top
all
the
flavors
were
except
the
pumpkin
it
didnt
highlight
the
pumpkin
it
just
covered
it
up
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
it
just
not
something
i
enjoyed
and
i
would
only
recommend
it
to
people
that
prefer
their
pumpkin
ales
heavy
on
the
dessert
side
all
in
all
this
beer
just
wasnt
for
me
i
could
see
how
some
people
would
like
it
but
to
me
it
just
wasnt
something
that
i
would
want
to
revisit
i
wish
it
was
much
more
balanced
since
the
pumpkin
flavors
only
showed
up
a
little
in
the
background
i
think
southern
tier
is
a
fairly
solid
brewery
but
i
havent
liked
any
beers
from
the
black
water
series
i
dont
think
this
its
as
bad
as
creme
brulee
but
it
isnt
much
better
either
i
appreciate
the
attempt
but
this
one
was
a
miss
for
me
better
luck
next
time
guys
o
first
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
liked
guess
ive
been
drinking
the
wrong
ones
this
so
far
has
been
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
this
season
the
alcohol
really
hides
itself
its
tasty
as
hell
and
drinks
super
easy
i
love
this
time
of
the
year
mainly
because
i
love
pumpkin
as
far
as
i
see
it
this
is
the
pumpkin
beer
to
beat
the
disappointing
news
not
a
single
distributor
in
the
state
of
iowa
o
its
a
pretty
intensly
flavored
beer
flavor
is
all
about
the
spice
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
all
hail
the
king
o
i
had
heard
this
beer
hyped
up
a
lot
this
was
a
letdown
for
me
it
wasnt
bad
but
the
huge
amount
of
cinnamon
spice
was
offputting
i
wanted
more
sweet
pumpkin
and
less
spice
this
is
a
slam
dunk
im
not
one
to
go
with
the
flow
i
love
imperial
stouts
but
im
not
a
fan
of
bcbs
but
in
this
case
pumking
is
a
brew
that
lives
up
to
the
hype
i
highly
recommend
this
gem
but
you
better
act
fast
and
get
it
while
it
lasts
or
it
will
be
gone
before
the
leaves
even
begin
to
start
changing
colors
overall
found
this
enjoyable
maybe
its
just
the
pretty
day
but
would
recommend
this
one
hell
might
be
more
enjoyable
then
dfh
not
overcarbonated
great
mediumfull
body
mouth
feel
ok
i
now
know
i
probably
just
dont
like
this
style
i
love
southern
tier
so
i
figured
this
was
a
good
bet
for
my
first
pumpkin
beer
but
i
thought
it
was
just
awful
and
poured
it
out
after
14
glass
i
like
spiced
beers
but
the
spices
here
not
only
overwhelm
the
standard
beer
ingredients
they
are
just
distasteful
other
types
of
beers
are
an
acquired
taste
but
i
think
you
have
to
be
born
with
a
taste
for
something
like
this
o
i
tried
this
2
years
ago
but
thought
i
got
a
skunked
bottle
turns
out
i
did
however
it
still
tastes
like
candy
corn
but
much
better
with
carbonation
long
live
the
king
o
i
love
this
beer
put
a
year
on
it
and
its
even
better
the
syrup
sweetness
goes
and
it
balances
nicely
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
92
overall
save
yourself
the
money
this
beer
honestly
gets
by
on
its
reputation
alone
i
cannot
fathom
why
anybody
would
be
impressed
by
this
brew
but
alas
to
each
their
own
this
is
a
wonderful
pumpkin
beer
but
for
being
in
a
22
oz
bomber
its
alot
to
drink
in
one
sitting
its
alittle
overwelming
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
alot
in
one
night
for
what
it
is
its
has
one
of
the
best
flavors
out
there
i
belive
if
it
was
thicker
it
would
be
even
better
curiosity
satisfied
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
again
o
i
thought
this
beer
was
awesome
the
alcohol
flavor
is
a
little
off
putting
but
the
smell
and
the
other
flavors
are
quite
a
treat
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
more
bolder
pumpkin
beers
around
and
if
youre
looking
for
something
this
fall
with
a
kick
at
8
5
abv
this
is
it
o
i
have
been
looking
for
a
good
pumpkin
flavored
beer
since
i
typically
enjoy
these
flavors
this
one
was
indeed
better
than
some
of
the
others
that
i
have
tried
but
im
not
sure
i
want
more
than
one
just
like
the
aforementioned
odd
case
this
beer
proves
itself
to
be
a
incredibly
hard
to
rate
and
examine
it
strays
so
far
from
what
even
craft
beer
drinkers
might
think
is
the
norm
or
the
norm
spectrum
regarding
balance
and
complexity
that
you
really
have
no
choice
but
to
give
in
completely
to
the
sensatory
impulses
and
forget
about
checking
criteria
boxes
o
i
must
say
im
not
a
big
fan
of
these
overly
flavored
beers
but
i
think
pumking
does
it
really
well
until
now
brooklyn
brewers
post
road
pumpkin
ale
was
the
only
pumpkin
beer
ive
really
liked
since
the
flavoring
is
more
subtle
than
most
pumking
takes
the
opposite
route
yet
i
still
really
enjoyed
it
many
pumpkin
beers
can
have
a
cloying
sweetness
but
this
beer
does
really
well
avoiding
that
it
delivers
on
the
fall
time
flavors
yet
because
of
its
thin
body
is
still
very
drinkable
ill
definitely
be
picking
this
up
again
as
we
creep
into
fall
i
like
this
better
than
last
years
and
looking
forward
to
having
more
what
a
fantastic
pedway
into
the
fall
and
pumkin
beers
excellent
job
o
interesting
to
say
the
least
the
pumpkin
comes
through
really
well
though
the
buttered
popcorn
like
mix
seems
odd

batch
is
a
easy
55
brew
i
love
pumpkin
ales
and
look
forward
to
the
season
every
year
but
this
tasted
like
i
was
drinking
pumpkin
potpourri
extract
i
couldnt
even
get
halfway
through
the
bottle
and
poured
the
rest
down
the
drain
which
i
have
a
very
hard
time
doing
i
was
majorly
disappointed
if
there
is
a
really
great
pumpkin
beer
out
there
i
sure
would
love
to
know
what
it
is
yes
the
emperor
has
beautiful
clothes
wow
i
expected
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
and
i
really
like
pumpkin
pie
this
was
not
at
all
close
to
anything
pumpkin
i
got
the
the
very
tangy
graham
cracker
taste
up
front
and
thought
what
followed
would
be
pure
enjoyment
it
was
pure
bitterness
there
was
nothing
discernible
but
bitterness
when
it
warmed
up
it
was
a
tad
more
drinkable
but
never
was
enjoyable
ive
had
many
pumpkin
brews
but
this
was
the
worst
too
disappointed
to
even
go
through
the
astmo
analysis
o
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
understand
why
it
seems
to
be
a
crowd
favorite
i
love
the
fact
that
it
has
all
of
the
components
of
a
pumpkin
pie
in
the
taste
and
aroma
im
so
glad
i
have
3
more
bottles
hanging
out
this
is
just
unbelievable
two
of
my
greatest
loves
pumpkin
and
craft
beer
enmeshed
together
into
a
phenominal
pumkin
ale
pumking
reigns
supreme
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
i
am
going
to
review
it
for
what
it
is
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
bottled
72213
pours
a
light
orange
with
a
one
inch
head
that
leaves
some
spotty
lace
smell
is
like
a
well
made
pumpkin
pie
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
to
go
along
with
the
aggressive
pumpkin
smell
taste
matches
the
smell
with
a
hint
of
orange
and
a
little
caramel
body
is
medium
thin
for
its
heft
would
prefer
a
little
more
life
not
dry
and
goes
down
easy
enough
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
pumpkin
legend
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
this
beer
excites
both
the
nose
and
the
palate
in
so
many
ways
this
has
a
strong
character
that
is
beer
not
desert
the
sour
bit
of
authentic
pumpkin
flavor
make
it
for
me
it
gives
it
depth
and
a
longevity
on
the
palate
the
balance
is
perfection
its
a
pumpkin
ale
you
could
serve
it
with
gingerbread
cookies
or
you
could
serve
it
with
carrot
and
ginger
soup
i
like
it
so
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
overall
this
beer
is
an
exception
for
me
i
normally
distrust
celebrity
beers
because
most
of
the
time
they
arent
all
that
good
founders
kbs
and
victory
golden
monkey
come
to
mind
but
this
beer
makes
me
want
to
put
on
a
childs
elephant
costume
and
throw
a
drunkin
pumpkin
carving
party
because
lets
face
it
this
beer
is
all
that
good
sure
the
taste
isnt
very
complex
but
the
aroma
spice
sugars
and
mouthfeel
balance
themselves
so
well
that
it
doesnt
need
to
be
now
go
buy
a
case
and
come
to
my
damn
party
the
beer
looked
orange
in
color
like
the
flesh
of
a
pumpkin
with
a
striking
clarity
there
wasnt
much
of
a
head
and
the
carbonation
bubbles
formed
wispy
streamers
the
smell
was
quite
a
bit
like
pumpkin
pie
with
the
vegetable
smell
mixing
with
cinnamon
and
dough
the
taste
was
much
more
intense
than
i
was
expecting
as
there
were
flavors
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
vanilla
and
nutmeg
up
front
followed
by
a
surprising
hop
presence
the
interplay
between
sweet
spicy
and
bitter
was
very
well
done
the
finish
was
dry
and
showcased
the
spices
the
body
was
a
little
thicker
than
medium
with
a
little
sticky
coating
in
the
mouth
i
usually
dont
go
for
pumpkin
beers
but
picked
this
up
based
on
the
recommendation
of
the
store
owner
and
glad
i
did
overall
this
years
run
is
not
bad
but
i
think
2011s
run
had
more
body
and
layered
flavors
the
bitterness
at
the
end
ruins
the
light
flavors
on
first
tasting
for
me
a
little
strong
on
the
spice
which
is
nice
because
too
many
seasonal
beers
are
overly
sweet
without
the
character
looks
like
a
typical
golden
lightly
amber
color
mid
to
low
carbonation
from
the
22
oz
bottle
this
was
my
second
try
of
the
season
which
was
consistent
with
the
first
definitely
pick
one
or
two
up
i
love
pumpkin
beers
and
this
one
took
the
cake
as
soon
as
you
hold
it
up
to
drink
it
the
smell
of
fall
goodness
is
right
there
i
have
tried
many
different
ones
and
this
is
hands
down
my
fav
southern
tier
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewerys
i
just
recently
found
them
and
have
liked
everything
i
have
tried
im
not
sure
how
i
missed
them
overall
solid
and
tasty
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
maybe
a
little
over
hyped
but
still
good
enough
to
enjoy
to
get
you
ready
for
the
fall
seasons
4
growlers
later
and
going
to
hit
the
pittsburgh
beer
distributors
for
the
7
cases
i
have
on
order
across
two
beer
distributors
hard
to
get
yet
only
2
and
12
hours
away
from
where
we
live
so
we
make
the
pilgrimage
up
to
the
brewery
at
least
3
times
over
the
autumn
season
we
havent
even
hit
september
yet
and
have
hit
the
brewery
3
times
yo
bitch
so
the
scoop
is
st
will
have
bottles
weekend
of
labor
day
for
now
its
5
glasses
and
growlers
so
we
are
getting
primed
for
the
upcoming
season
the
warlock
which
comes
out
in
september
should
be
tasty
im
already
thinking
black
orange
with
the
king
warlock
actually
had
some
king
left
at
the
bottom
of
a
growler
which
sat
for
2
weeks
in
the
fridge
talk
about
taste
coming
out
yeah
it
lost
carbonation
bitches
but
the
flavor
was
10
times
more
intense
this
beer
winters
well
if
you
read
this
far
on
more
piece
of
trivia
st
made
more
pumking
this
year
than
they
did
of
all
their
beers
in
2011
this
from
the
wife
of
one
of
the
owners
o
not
the
worldclass
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
good
nonetheless
thanks
to
my
buddy
brad
in
buffalo
n
y
for
shipping
this
out
here
o
outstanding
offering
by
southern
tier
ill
look
for
this
every
fall
cheers
o
i
have
never
been
a
big
fan
of
this
type
of
spiced
ale
although
i
must
say
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
in
the
past
did
not
deliver
the
pumpkin
flavor
that
this
truly
does
well
done
surprisingly
drinkable
this
would
make
a
great
holiday
beer
to
share
with
friends
and
family
edit
as
the
beer
warmed
slightly
the
contrast
lessened
slightly
id
heard
quite
a
bit
about
this
from
my
fellow
sots
but
hadnt
pulled
the
trigger
until
now
part
of
it
was
that
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
pricey
for
a
pumpkin
ale
which
it
would
be
except
this
is
different
from
all
the
rest
which
are
kind
of
boring
tbh
i
know
it
sounds
trite
to
repeat
what
everybody
else
says
about
tasting
like
pumpkin
pie
so
i
wont
what
i
will
say
is
that
it
has
an
incredibly
creamy
taste
to
it
which
either
by
itself
or
in
conjunction
with
somethings
else
serves
to
mask
the
alc
which
at
the
end
of
22
oz
is
definitely
felt
it
doesnt
feel
right
to
give
something
this
sweet
a
higher
grade
for
a
beer
although
maybe
im
a
prisoner
of
my
history
i
would
have
it
again
but
would
want
to
share
it
next
time
i
have
been
trying
pumpkin
ales
for
a
few
years
now
and
by
a
hugh
margin
this
is
the
best
of
the
bunch
o
a
good
representation
of
the
style
which
i
dont
care
much
for
smells
absolutely
amazing
very
sweet
taste
reminds
you
its
a
beer
which
i
really
like
better
than
i
remember
southern
tier
pumking
45
year
after
year
pumking
is
still
killing
most
of
the
other
pumpkin
ales
out
there
overall
a
very
good
seasonal
beer
and
a
classic
example
of
the
pumpkin
yam
style
twitter
thecuriograph
if
you
like
pumpkin
pie
pumpkin
anything
and
wished
your
love
of
pumpkin
was
also
in
sparkling
liquid
form
look
no
further
this
is
all
you
have
to
know
this
is
perfect
this
is
what
you
have
been
dreaming
of
this
is
what
is
in
the
pot
at
the
end
of
the
rainbow
wooo
mama
like
the
wicked
witch
of
the
west
doing
three
sixtys
on
her
broom
stick
this
one
has
raul
buzzin
its
like
this
its
like
that
and
its
like
this
and
uh
subtle
spices
and
subtle
pumpkin
like
waking
up
next
to
alejandra
ambrosio
after
a
bender
yes
please
omy
first
pumpkin
ale
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
the
nose
on
this
is
the
best
ive
ever
smelled
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
but
is
a
bit
too
funky
maybe
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
but
its
not
a
huge
problem
a
very
good
brew
i
wish
id
bought
another
bomber
taste
great
fall
spices
that
turn
to
a
nice
pumpkin
in
your
mouth
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
pumpkin
beer
nothing
id
want
more
than
a
bottle
of
but
good
in
a
single
serving
this
is
the
perfect
pumpkin
ale
to
me
it
has
by
far
the
best
smell
of
any
other
its
just
like
pumpkin
ice
cream
the
taste
is
consuming
spice
and
loaded
with
pumpkin
drink
it
slow
and
savor
it
few
beers
have
this
much
flavor
it
really
is
sensory
overload
in
the
best
possible
way
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
unless
something
can
trump
it
the
pumpking
wins
my
seasonal
beer
of
the
year
by
far
i
cant
wait
to
drink
one
this
fall
lessons
this
beer
does
not
age
well
serve
at
40
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
beer
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
again
overall
i
am
only
drinking
this
now
because
ive
never
tried
it
2013
bottle
its
interesting
theres
a
lot
of
pumpkin
flavor
and
a
nice
mix
of
spices
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
worthy
of
an
other
bottle
at
least
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
fall
it
is
good
but
it
is
not
as
drinkable
as
great
pumpkin
it
is
a
fantastic
pumpkin
beer
but
like
a
lot
of
southern
tiers
stuff
it
should
be
enjoyed
in
smaller
quantities
or
split
between
a
few
people
p
s
its
august
2nd
i
cant
complain
enough
as
to
why
im
drinking
this
at
this
very
moment
lol
overall
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
cold
in
mid
to
late
october
earlier
or
later
depending
on
which
climactic
zone
you
dwell
in
it
is
worth
trying
and
will
likely
become
a
cherished
seasonal
overall
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
very
impressive
2014
really
big
on
sweetness
this
year
maybe
my
palate
has
changed
since
i
really
couldnt
get
into
pumpkin
beers
this
year
but
bleh
overall
the
king
of
the
pumpkin
beers
and
a
no
brainer
if
its
available
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
it
has
been
aged
for
a
little
over
a
year
and
i
am
curious
to
try
the
fresh
version
to
see
if
the
pumpkin
taste
is
stronger
i
feel
like
the
spices
in
this
one
were
pretty
heavy
towards
the
finish
overall
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
with
age
it
loses
its
sharp
cinnamon
profile
in
favor
of
more
tame
pumpkin
pie
notes
and
in
my
opinion
its
for
the
best
it
truly
becomes
a
can
of
pumpkin
pie
sorry
for
the
lack
of
a
better
description
but
thats
the
only
way
to
accurately
describe
this
beer
im
excited
for
this
years
release
please
understand
when
i
say
i
loved
the
2012
version
of
this
classic
it
tasted
so
true
to
pumpkin
pie
my
wife
who
is
not
a
beer
drinker
and
i
couldnt
get
enough
the
2013
version
of
which
my
wife
had
me
buy
a
case
tastes
to
me
like
burnt
brown
sugar
i
cant
get
past
it
there
is
a
half
case
in
my
cellar
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
that
i
have
tasted
the
pumking
is
the
perfect
drink
during
the
fall
with
great
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
vanilla
flavors
great
to
have
with
dinner
or
just
having
a
casual
drink
i
cant
wait
until
this
is
on
tap
again
so
glad
southern
tier
is
now
available
in
texas
overall
age
has
transformed
this
good
pumpkin
beer
into
almost
a
cinnamon
roll
beer
interesting
how
this
one
aged
o
decent
beer
for
a
fallpumpkin
seasonal
but
its
mega
sweet
as
is
to
be
expected
from
southern
tier
and
the
nutmeg
can
get
a
bit
intense
at
points
o
pumking
is
the
definitive
pumpkin
beer
for
a
reason
pouring
a
glass
immediately
calls
for
turkey
and
yams
southern
tier
welcome
to
my
november
lineup
overall
pumking
is
definitely
an
interesting
take
on
the
pumpkin
beer
it
does
achieve
in
evoking
thoughts
of
pumpkin
pie
and
the
autumn
season
drinking
one
definitely
feels
like
its
time
to
bring
on
the
season
i
enjoy
having
one
of
these
in
the
season
but
i
dont
find
it
something
i
would
really
seek
out
all
the
time
or
of
which
id
buy
excessive
quantities
still
its
definitely
worth
a
try
as
the
legend
it
is
those
that
enjoy
it
really
seem
to
love
it
so
there
is
value
in
finding
out
if
it
meshes
well
with
your
palate
during
the
season
it
seems
to
available
just
about
anywhere
and
at
6
99
a
bottle
in
this
area
at
least
it
is
reasonably
priced
so
its
worth
at
least
one
try
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
of
the
fall
season
there
does
not
appear
to
be
a
lot
of
actual
pumpkin
involved
but
the
beer
is
spiced
very
nicely
on
top
of
that
the
8
6
alcohol
percentage
is
blended
very
well
this
is
one
of
the
lightest
pumpkin
beers
out
there
but
it
makes
up
for
it
in
spice
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
you
can
buy
a
must
drink
every
fall
for
me
and
my
girlfriend
o
good
drinkability
its
sweetness
and
spiceness
does
not
compromise
it
excellent
ale
i
couldnt
imagine
that
a
pumpkin
ale
could
be
so
good
22

this
is
a
world

pumpkin

incredible
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
and
insanely
easy
to
sip
on
a
very
incredible
pumpkin
ale
offering
and
one
of
the
best
ever
made
without
a
doubt
this
beer
has
a
great
dark
orange
color
and
tastes
exactly
like
pumpkin
bread
and
its
delicious
i
have
recently
fallen
out
of
love
with
many
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
was
pretty
different
and
interesting
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
it
was
really
well
done
as
a
pumpkin
bread
beer
also
it
smelled
like
pumpkin
and
spices
kind
of
like
the
house
smells
after
you
bake
some
pumpkin
bread
this
beer
gets
a
lot
of
hate
and
to
me
for
no
apparent
reason
on
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
the
reverence
this
beer
gets
with
drinkers
is
an
embellishment
regardless
this
is
still
a
most
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
with
blended
spices
brown
sugar
notes
vanilla
and
creaminess
in
the
body
would
love
to
try
the
oakaged
version
the
beer
is
slightly
hazy
and
autumnal
orange
colored
with
a
soapy
white
head
the
aroma
offers
fall
spice
pumpkin
bread
brown
sugar
rum
malt
cinnamon
pie
wow
fabulous
scents
coming
from
this
beer
delicious
flavor
how
is
it
possible
i
havent
crossed
paths
with
this
beer
before
so
complex
and
wonderful
great
feel
as
well
thick
and
syrupy
not
cloying
but
sweetness
is
present
throughout
a
great
beer
to
split
with
a
few
buddies
at
over
8
abv
it
is
a
little
heavy
but
still
remains
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
i
cant
wait
until
next
fall
overallcomments
very
solid
beer
with
a
great
flavorsmell
profile
maybe
a
bit
much
on
the
spices
imo
but
still
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
that
i
have
had
classified
as
a
pumpkin
ale

o
ive
tried
a
lot
of
pumpkin
beers
and
this
one
differentiates
itself
from
all
others
it
has
a
unique
taste
and
is
an
awesome
holiday
beer
this
one
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
this
one
i
like
out
of
the
bevy
of
pumpkin
type
products
lots
of
pumpkin
pie
like
flavor
nice
mouthfeel
not
overly
sweet
definitely
can
taste
the
actual
pumpkin
so
better
balanced
versus
other
of
this
style
not
overwhelmed
by
the
pie
spices
for
a
change
a
good
dessert
option
not
something
to
drink
a
lot
of
or
very
often
high
b
overall
yea
its
a
good
one
overall
id
say
its
just
very
clean
with
lots
of
strong
flavors
but
nothing
really
overpowers
anything
else
tough
to
find
any
complaints
although
some
may
find
it
too
sweet
i
think
pumpkin
beers
should
be
sweet
one
of
the
top
pumpkin
beers
i
can
remember
trying
out
o
overall
this
is
probably
the
second
best
pumpkin
beer
that
i
have
had
after
dfh
punkin
and
the
two
are
incomparable
it
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
will
certainly
come
back
to
it
but
it
doesnt
enter
into
my
top
echelon
of
beers
nonetheless
a
big
tip
of
my
cap
to
southern
tier
very
well
done
overall
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
for
that
i
have
to
give
it
a
high
overall
rating
very
tasty
some
will
disagree
but
im
a
huge
fan
cheers
this
beer
is
a
polarizer
for
sure
but
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
youve
got
to
love
pumking
it
pours
a
very
understated
pale
pumpkin
color
right
on
que
with
a
few
inches
of
lazy
and
patient
white
foam
the
nose
is
incredible
as
much
like
a
christmas
cookie
as
a
pumpkin
pie
this
beer
has
staying
power
beyond
fall
into
the
holiday
season
because
of
its
unique
spice
bouquet
which
prominently
features
clove
vanilla
and
allspice
there
is
less
squashy
aromatics
and
forward
flavors
in
the
draft
version
than
from
the
bottle
im
not
sure
why
it
still
tastes
like
fresh
raw
pumpkin
but
i
think
the
spices
intensify
in
the
keg
somehow
its
still
well
balanced
with
sweet
cookie
malt
and
gentle
cinnamon
up
front
and
the
vegetable
spice
finish
on
the
back
end
without
all
the
sugary
vibes
woud
expect
the
alcohol
is
also
dangerously
well
disguised
the
mouthfeel
i
thought
was
also
exceptional
really
smooth
but
not
heavy
at
all
for
a
beer
of
this
magnitude
overall
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
out
and
not
least
because
of
its
wide
seasonal
appeal
amazingly
well
made
this
could
be
southern
tiers
best
offering
pours
a
very
clear
bright
pale
orange
with
a
two
finger
frothy
off
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
patchy
quarter
finger
creamy
head
aroma
is
graham
cracker
crust
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
vegetable
sweetness
big
sweetness
up
front
is
followed
by
mouth
coating
spices
like
drinking
liquid
pumpkin
pie
no
perceptible
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
smooth
and
creamy
just
a
little
sweater
and
it
would
be
cloying
first
time
reviewing
pumking
after
having
it
numerous
times
among
the
best
pumpkin
beers
available
big
and
bold
like
southern
tier
does
best
i
can
see
how
some
would
be
put
off
by
pumking
its
a
lovehate
beer
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
one
next
year
0
within
its
category
this
beer
is
unrivaled
id
go
on
to
say
that
this
beer
dominates
in
its
category
unlike
any
other
beer
theyre
may
be
room
for
improvement
but
i
hope
southern
tier
doesnt
break
what
isnt
broken
overall
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
several
years
running
no
doubt
that
the
pureed
pumpkin
in
the
brew
contributes
to
the
awesomeness
of
pumking
i
ran
into
this
delicious
pumpkin
beer
at
one
of
my
favorite
watering
holes
four
moon
which
is
around
the
corner
from
me
wouldnt
luck
have
it
that
after
having
a
couple
and
promising
to
be
back
for
more
with
the
next
moon
rising
there
was
none
to
be
had
after
weeks
of
searching
and
kicking
the
cats
i
stumbled
onto
it
my
favorite
place
to
go
for
ribs
is
twin
anchors
there
may
be
better
ribs
but
not
better
establishments
by
accident
last
week
i
stumbled
in
and
found

this
beer
is
always
a
treat
i
am
only
lukewarm
on
pumpkin
beers
but
the
southern
tier
version
is
always
a
favorite
poured
from
a
bomber
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
light
copper
hue
the
smell
is
light
vanilla
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
as
far
as
taste
i
best
describe
this
as
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
with
whipped
cream
the
beer
is
not
heavily
spiced
and
really
resembles
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
there
is
a
creaminess
to
the
flavor
to
balance
the
pumpkin
notes
rich
and
way
too
drinkable
for
the
abv
a
very
tasty
treat
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
with
pumpkin
muffins
but
i
would
match
this
beer
with
other
non
pumpkin
desserts
to
fully
appreciate
the
ale
and
dessert
try
this
with
plain
cheesecake
or
vanilla
ice
cream
o
a
satisfying
pumpkin
ale
and
probably
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
albeit
this
style
is
very
subjective
and
open
to
interpretation
by
the
brewer
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
im
rating
this
according
to
style
where
it
scores
quite
well
in
my
opinion
overall
the
smell
and
taste
of
pumpkin
spice
is
perfect
and
brings
to
mind
visions
of
fall
but
the
sweetness
and
flat
mouthfeel
quickly
start
to
outweigh
those
qualities
and
make
it
tiring
overall
another
side
of
the
spectrum
of
pumpkin
beer
not
like
the
pumpkin
pie
as
the
others
have
reminded
us
of
but
definitely
unique
i
would
completely
drink
this
again
super
delicious
o
id
like
to
say
that
this
king
deserves
the
crown
that
everyone
wants
to
give
it
but
im
not
entirely
convinced
horseheads
makes
a
pumpkin
ale
that
may
give
this
one
a
run
for
its
money
id
love
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
these
two
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
only
disappointment
is
they
do
not
brew
this
beer
year
round
but
i
guess
that
is
what
makes
it
even
more
exceptional
this
beer
never
last
long
when
ever
it
is
tap
so
do
not
hesitate
get
one
when
ever
you
can
oquite
possibly
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
ever
had
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
who
likes
pumpkin
ales
excellent
overall
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
highly
recommended
to
anyone
into
the
fallpumpkin
styles
i
just
love
this
beer
i
bought
2
cases
of
it
at
6
99
per
a
bottle
its
a
hard
beer
to
find
when
they
sell
it
at
whole
foods
you
have
to
request
it
because
its
not
on
the
shelves
and
they
only
allow
1
bottle
per
person
per
day
they
sell
it
at
churchkey
for
18
a
bottle
this
beer
smells
amazing
smells
like
vanilla
pumpkin
tastes
like
vanilla
pumpkin
without
all
those
spices
like
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
that
can
be
overpowering
its
smooth
this
is
my
fav
beer
of
all
time
so
far
o
most
flavorful
pumpkin
beer
out
there
if
you
dont
like
sweetsugary
flavors
this
is
not
your
beer
overall
amazing
achievement
bravo
southern
tier
alcohol
is
imperceptible
crisp
up
front
with
a
very
pumpkiny
finish
pours
about
the
same
color
as
a
marzen
with
an
excellent
aroma
overall
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
on
the
finish
but
a
good
novelty
beer
i
still
prefer
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
to
any
other
pumpkin
beer
ive
tried
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
it
certainly
has
enough
competition
but
its
the
best
ive
had
it
really
looks
like
a
pumpkin
it
has
that
perfect
orange
tint
you
can
really
smell
and
taste
the
pumpkin
in
the
beer
its
been
said
before
but
ill
say
it
again
the
beer
really
benefits
from
the
real
pumpkin
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
perfectly
creamy
overall
i
do
enjoy
pumking
but
it
is
not
at
the
top
of
my
pumpkin
ale
list
like
it
is
for
a
lot
of
other
people
it
is
a
different
brew
than
the
other
more
heavily
spiced
pumpkin
ales
for
sure
enjoyable
but
there
are
still
a
few
others
that
i
would
choose
over
this
one
if
given
the
choice
schlafly
and
good
gourd
to
name
a
couple
overall
a
solid
brew
its
very
clear
that
i
need
to
buy
another
bottle
or
two
before
it
goes
out
of
season
this
is
a
really
special
beer
that
you
must
try
if
given
the
opportunity
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
in
the
past
i
had
said
that
there
were
vanilla
notes
that
i
didnt
like
and
the
spices
were
too
intense
that
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
case
with
the
2012
batch
the
pie
crust
and
whip
cream
notes
were
fantastic
im
not
sure
how
st
pulled
that
off
but
im
impressed
this
was
an
all
around
great
beer
overall
impression
if
you
enjoy
a
good
pumpkin
beer
but
tire
of
the
in
your
face
stuff
and
the
heavies
this
is
a
good
reach
given
some
of
the
interesting
twists
in
pumpking
its
much
more
interesting
than
other
examples
ive
had
neophytes
to
the
style
might
find
it
a
bit
on
the
funky
side
but
ill
be
chasing
down
more
of
this
stuff
osouthern
tier
does
a
good
job
for
their
sweet
specialty
beers
this
is
a
prime
example
and
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
my
first
time
with
southern
tiers
pumking
and
i
have
to
say
this
is
the
best
of
the
pumpkin
ales
by
far
in
taste
the
coloring
is
a
nice
copperish
orange
and
great
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
and
the
taste
put
you
in
the
mind
of
a
pumpkin
pie
as
i
seriously
feel
like
someone
just
liquified
a
pumpkin
pie
and
gave
it
to
me
in
a
bottle
this
beer
is
amazing
o
i
cant
drink
a
ton
of
it
but
once
a
year
its
a
nice
treat
overall
wow
this
beer
was
very
delicious
i
really
underestimated
this
brew
once
i
laid
first
eyes
on
it
the
overall
flavors
of
pumpkin
spices
and
caramel
cream
and
vanilla
really
brings
this
beer
full
circle
i
would
totally
enjoy
this
brew
again
o
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
too
many
pumpkin
beers
smell
just
of
pumpkin
spices
and
not
like
the
actual
fruit
where
this
one
actually
finds
the
smell
and
flavors
of
pumpkin
this
beer
sets
itself
apart
from
rest
i
love
pumpkin
beer
but
this
one
does
it
best
o
this
is
the
first
year
i
have
gotten
into
trying
a
bunch
of
pumpkin
beers
what
i
have
learned
is
there
is
a
big
gap
between
the
good
ones
and
the
bad
ones
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
good
ones
with
a
phenomenal
aroma
and
very
good
taste
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
rich
and
tasty
this
probably
isnt
for
everyone
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
beer
is
really
quite
delicious
the
sweetness
is
not
overbearing
or
cloying
and
there
is
a
light
amount
of
hop
bitterness
that
helps
to
balance
it
out
annually
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
that
is
easily
accessible
in
the
area
very
appetizing
in
the
smell
and
the
taste
note
absolutely
love
the
pumking
bottle
label
wicked
p
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
flavor
beers
but
i
still
enjoy
trying
them
this
one
isnt
bad
but
im
still
searching
for
that
one
that
changes
the
way
i
look
at
pumpkin
beers
forever
overall
wasnt
completely
blown
away
by
this
beer
i
feel
like
if
they
toned
down
the
malt
they
could
even
market
this
as
a
christmas
eggnog
beer
lots
of
those
similar
spices
at
play
really
interesting
flavors
good
balance
between
them
and
the
malt
definitely
a
great
beer
and
worth
a
try
o
good
beer
with
more
flavor
than
the
typical
pumking
ale
alcohol
is
hidden
well
overall
lots
of
reviews
say
this
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
ive
never
had
pumpkin
pie
this
good
someday
i
want
someone
to
present
me
with
a
fall
dessert
that
tastes
this
good
actually
on
second
thought
id
rather
they
just
give
me
a
big
pour
of
pumking
wow
if
you
like
pumkin
pie
try
this
what
a
great
fall
beer
to
warm
the
pallet
and
watch
a
game
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
seasonal
beers
to
bring
in
hallows
eve
if
you
get
a
chance
its
a
must
have
its
hard
to
find
so
good
luck
it
sells
out
before
you
can
tell
your
friends
final
thoughts
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
pumpkin
ales
which
are
few
and
far
between
the
added
graham
cracker
taste
sets
it
apart
and
makes
it
one
to
seek
out
as
we
head
into
october
o
overall
id
say
pumking
is
the
king
of
the
pumpkin
beers
i
have
enjoyed
thus
far
definitely
a
great
brew
with
dessert
we
ordered
a
dirty
pumpkin
layered
beer
with
a
top
layer
of
milkstout
which
got
me
to
thinking
about
bombing
this
with
a
shot
of
baileys
im
sure
itll
taste
just
like
pumpkin
pie
ill
update
when
i
make
this
happen
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
nose
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
spice
nut
meg
creating
that
classic
pumpkin
pie
aroma
the
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
with
a
nice
hoppy
bite
this
is
the
first
fall
seasonal
beer
that
i
have
tried
this
year
and
it
looks
like
its
going
to
be
a
great
year
southern
tier
has
an
uppertier
entry
pumpkin
ale
here
pours
a
thin
light
amber
with
almost
no
head
biscuitymalt
smell
with
faint
spices
i
dont
know
what
the
prominent
spice
is
in
this
beer
is
it
nutmeg
but
it
is
so
overpowing
that
it
covers
up
any
semblance
of
pumpkin
backbone
regardless
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
around
and
one
that
will
be
in
heavy
rotation
for
me
as
the
temperature
cools
and
leaves
begin
to
fall
o
the
pumpkin
used
in
these
beer
makes
the
world
of
a
difference
the
spiced
complemented
the
beer
rather
than
be
the
only
resemblance
of
pumpkin
appearance
let
me
down
with
little
head
great
smell
from
the
pumpkin
and
spices
great
flavor
complexity
and
good
full
feel
to
this
imperial
spiced
beer
o
this
is
has
been
one
of
my
favor
pumpkin
beers
the
spice
flavor
seems
a
bit
more
pronounced
this
year
when
i
think
of
the
past
couple
years
but
the
pumpkin
is
still
the
main
player
i
look
for
ward
to
this
beer
year
after
year
even
though
im
not
a
fan
of
the
pumpkin
style
because
most
are
so
heavy
spiced
you
could
just
call
a
christmas
beer
and
youd
never
no
pours
light
amber
with
minimal
head
and
no
real
lacing
smell
is
very
sweet
mouthfeel
is
good
and
alcohol
is
not
at
all
overpowering
this
beer
is
like
a
liquid
pumpkin
roll
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
strength
of
it
although
i
would
only
want
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
due
to
the
sweetness
a
great
fall
desert
beer
not
like
any
other
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
even
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
pumpkins
i
would
highly
suggest
that
you
still
check
this
one
out
since
it
may
be
one
you
would
actually
like
excellent
overall
i
really
enjoy
their
2x
stout
and
have
found
that
southern
tier
is
brewing
unique
exceptional
products
and
this
did
not
disappoint
i
would
rate
it
1
of
the
8
pumpkin
ales
i
tried
and
can
say
that
its
unique
if
you
want
to
contrast
it
with
another
exceptional
pumpkin
try

o
southern
tier
has
done
it
again
a
very
complete
and
well
rounded
pumpkin
brew
ive
had
other
pumpkin
brews
that
captue
the
flavor
of
pumpkin
and
even
pumpkin
and
associated
spices
but
not
pumpkin
spices
and
pie
crust
this
is
one
amazing
brew
and
highly
recommend
this
for
any
pumpkin
lover
and
would
definately
buy
again
o
i
think
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
made
i
didnt
care
much
for
this
style
before
trying
pumking
now
i
try
other
pumpkin
beers
just
to
find
out
if
theres
anything
better
i
havent
found
anything
that
compares
yet
overall
it
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
sipper
that
is
lacking
enough
body
to
back
up
the
hardy
flavors
and
be
great
overall
this
is
a
pretty
amped
up
pumpkin
ale
but
i
can
see
why
so
many
people
like
it
o
4
25
truly
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
which
is
great
if
youre
me
and
you
love
pumpkin
pie
everybody
kept
saying
this
was
the
best
pumpkin
ale
and
i
didnt
want
to
listen
because
i
had
heard
it
was
heavier
on
the
spices
which
is
exactly
what
i
dont
like
in
a
pumpkin
ale
just
a
mouthful
of
spices
but
they
were
right
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
and
i
had
basically
given
up
on
the
style
the
pumpkin
component
is
right
and
the
spices
are
deftly
done
and
the
accompanying
flavors
and
aromas
evoking
buttery
baked
goods
are
just
delicious
the
whole
thing
is
beautiful
if
i
had
any
way
to
make
it
better
i
might
make
it
a
bit
heavier
and
more
robust
it
was
lighter
than
expected
still
very
good
though
o
i
have
to
say
this
really
surprised
me
for
years
i
hated
the
thought
of
this
beer
and
with
time
grew
a
appreciation
for
different
things
im
really
glad
i
revisited
this
huge
improvement
in
my
palate
and
cant
wait
to
get
more
in
sum
this
is
a
remarkable
elixir
as
capable
of
eliciting
memory
ofand
longing
fora
taste
as
any
beer
i
have
encountered
now
for
the
taste
wow
i
was
not
expecting
a
taste
even
more
delicious
than
the
smell
imagine
biting
into
a
delicious
pumpkin
pie
while
drinking
one
of
your
favorite
ales
now
put
it
together
incredible
brew
here
the
taste
stays
in
your
mouth
for
a
while
and
warms
you
up
really
quickly
this
is
a
perfect
brew
for
the
holidays
and
ive
already
recommended
to
many
friends
and
family
o
this
is
an
excellent
pumpkin
beer
obviously
it
got
high
marks
from
me
but
it
would
have
gotten
even
higher
ones
if
more
of
the
actual
base
beer
was
apparent
since
the
pumpkin
pie
aroma
and
taste
was
so
outrageously
welldone
i
cant
give
it
less
than
a
4
5
in
those
categories
this
is
definitely
the
best
pumpkin
beer
that
ive
had
id
really
really
like
to
try
the
beers
from
this
category
that
are
rated
higher
great
pumpkin
beer
if
others
dont
have
a
strong
enough
yet
balanced
pumpkin
taste
look
no
further
appearance
is
a
deep
orange
with
a
disappearing
head
and
after
a
bit
is
almost
nonexistent
the
smell
is
incredible
with
fall
spices
brown
sugar
nutmeg
a
strong
breads
malt
flavor
leads
into
the
taste
for
those
that
like
pumpkin
bread
more
than
just
pumpkin
this
beers
flavor
is
as
close
as
it
gets
also
i
think
this
beer
excels
in
a
weizen
glass
rather
than
a
conical
pint
glass
to
accentuate
the
aroma
and
bring
out
the
head
a
bit
this
is
my
new
benchmark
for
a
good
pumpkin
ale
no
competition
is
even
with
the
scope
of
what
this
beer
has
accomplished
in
my
mouth
o
like
i
stated
at
the
start
this
is
a
beer
i
wait
and
wait
and
wait
for
every
year
i
also
for
the
last
two
years
put
a
bottle
aside
to
drink
on
oct
31st
of
the
following
year
cannot
wait
to
crack
my
2011
bottle
this
year
o
a
very
solid
pumpkin
beer
a
bit
sweet
but
still
very
tasty
also
at
67
for
a
bomber
this
is
a
damn
steal
o
wow
this
is
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
excellent
flavor
and
aromas
and
a
good
amount
of
alcohol
o
if
you
are
looking
for
straight
up
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
this
is
the
beer
to
try
amazing
pumpkin
ale
will
definitely
have
again
and
again
ive
had
several
other
southern
tier
brews
all
very
good
just
adds
to
the
surprising
let
down
this
is
a
rerate
after
being
more
accustomed
to
the
style
still
not
loving
the
nutmeg
pour
is
a
beautiful
orange
with
big
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
spice
and
wheat
a
little
dusty
flavor
is
lots
of
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
with
cinnamon
presence
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
dirty
wheaty
finish
that
i
still
dont
like
some
dustiness
slightly
dry
and
the
nutmeg
is
just
overpowering
i
just
dont
get
this
oneand
same
goes
for
the
other
overly
spiced
pumpkin
beers
why
not
make
these
taste
like
pumpkin
instead
of
liquid
nutmeg
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
worth
seeking
out
this
one
is
more
sweet
and
buttery
than
some
of
the
other
pumpkin
ales
making
it
seem
more
rich
the
buttery
crust
flavor
mixed
with
the
pumpkin
and
spices
is
what
makes
this
a
great
beer
overall
drinkability
probably
my
second
favorite
pumpkin
ale
after
dogfish
head
o
im
very
pleased
that
i
decided
to
give
this
beer
another
try
i
must
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
last
year
or
something
i
shared
the
bottle
with
a
friend
so
maybe
drinking
the
entire
bottle
myself
last
year
was
too
overwhelming
anyway
a
very
delicious
dessert
beer
and
most
definitely
worth
a
try
or
two
d
drinks
more
like
a
pumpkin
spiced
latte
from
starbucks
than
a
beer
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
to
date
if
you
are
looking
for
big
flavors
in
this
seasonal
style
this
is
the
way
to
go
overall
a
big
tasting
pumpkin
beer
in
that
it
has
truly
captured
the
taste
of
pumpkin
pie
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
big
sweet
pumpkin
beer
this
is
definitely
one
you
should
reach
for
overall
who
knows
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
i
dont
think
so
i
bought
this
at
a
very
reputable
joint
and
drank
it
well
before
the
expiration
date
not
exposed
to
high
temps
did
not
get
cold
and
hot
multiple
times
i
dont
know
but
this
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
displeasure
of
drinking
my
buddy
and
i
both
drain
poured
most
of
our
glasses
which
i
do
not
do
very
often
ill
never
buy
it
again
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
bad
bottle
though
mouthfeel
insanely
sticky
and
filling
ive
never
been
able
to
take
down
a
bomber
by
myself
without
feeling
like
i
ate
and
entire
familys
thanksgiving
dinner
overall
this
used
to
be
one
of
the
great
ones
pumpkin
ales
but
it
has
fallen
off
a
bit
gone
is
the
gordlike
pumpkin
flavor
that
has
been
replaced
with
a
flatter
more
chemical
taste
in
the
end
not
terrible
just
not
great
much
better
ones
out
there
cheers
o
excellent
pumpkin
beer
not
for
everyone
the
buttery
taste
for
some
isnt
quite
there
however
i
love
it
one
of
my
favs
during
fall
drinkability
probably
best
pumpkin
ale
we
sell
at
hop
city
although
i
am
interested
to
try
the
weyerbacher
pumpkin
with
over
30
pumpkin
beers
every
season
it
can
get
a
little
overwhelming
i
believe
southern
tier
achieved
exactly
what
they
wanted
here
so
congrats
for
that
2013
previous
was
2012
had
some
of
this
on
tap
and
it
is
a
different
experience
there
is
still
a
pumpkin
pie
aroma
but
the
taste
is
that
of
an
extremely
refined
strong
ale
with
pumpkin
outstanding
o
this
is
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
pumpkin
beer
its
spicy
and
has
bold
flavors
and
if
you
like
seasonal
spiceladen
beers
youll
love
this
it
was
a
bit
much
for
me
and
i
could
see
maybe
having
one
as
a
dessert
beer
after
thanksgiving
meal
but
overall
it
was
too
much
spice
for
my
liking
o
this
is
if
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
darn
near
close
if
the
carbonation
and
body
were
worked
it
it
would
verge
on
the
perfect
pumpkin
ale
best
seasonal
beer
i
had
tried
so
far
the
balance
between
spice
and
pumpkin
was
almost
perfect
enough
spice
to
compliment
but
not
overpower
the
pumpkin
which
should
be
the
focus
of
pumpkin
beer
in
my
opinion
definitely
makes
me
way
to
invest
time
into
trying
more
southern
tier
brews
o
a
really
good
example
of
this
style
pumpkin
beers
can
be
disappointing
when
they
do
not
have
a
pumpkin
flavor
that
clearly
shines
through
and
this
one
really
delivers
improves
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
i
bought
three
bombers
and
will
wait
till
late
fall
to
enjoy
the
other
two
this
will
be
perfect
sitting
next
to
a
fire
the
longer
version
i
expected
something
similar
to
dogfish
heads
punkin
but
this
most
closely
resembled
an
absolutely
horrid
michelob
vanilla
oak
that
i
tried
last
year
all
i
tasted
in
the
pumkin
was
a
very
chemical
vanilla
taste
maybe
a
touch
of
spice
and
some
alcohol
but
every
sip
was
overwhelmed
by
the
vanilla
and
i
love
vanilla
but
not
in
this
beer
i
very
rarely
regret
a
beer
purchase
but
this
impulse
buy
was
literally
money
down
the
drain
overall
great
beer
that
i
will
purchase
every
fall
to
help
prepare
me
for
the
season
ahead
o
if
you
enjoy
chemical
cocktails
with
mild
stomach
pain
this
is
your
drink
i
refuse
to
call
this
beer
i
choked
down
half
a
pint
and
drain
poured
the
rest
of
the
bottle
overall
this
beer
has
potential
but
the
huge
bready
notes
just
terrorize
this
beer
the
pumpkin
is
sapposed
to
be
the
star
in
a
pumpkin
ale
it
certain
was
missed
by
a
long
shot
in
this
beer
i
am
not
sure
what
all
the
hype
is
surrounding
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
even
though
it
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
genuine
pumpkin
flavors
realistically
though
the
flavor
of
raw
pumpkin
isnt
all
that
exciting
if
youre
looking
for
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
this
is
the
one
you
seek

i

i
really
enjoyed

though
i
suppose
my

may
have
changed
in
the
intervening
months
burnt
crust
turns
to
warm
booze

definitely
warms
the

tasty
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
huge
spice
on

of

quite
nice
i
shared
this
beer
but
i
could
see
myself
finishing
off
a
whole
one
of
these
on
my
own
so
very
drinkable
strikes
me
as
very
much
a
dessert
beer
though
not
sure
how
i
would
pair
this
with
food
the
only
drawback
is
the
lack
of
lacing
but
it
is
definitely
different
from
those
i
have
had
in
the
past

but
here
it
is
a
little
more
distinct
in
giving
the
full
pumpkin

experience

with
beer
there
is
a
prominent
element
of
sweetness

im

glad

this

ive
had
a
number
of
different
southern
tier
offerings
and
i
always
find
them
to
be
to
malty
for
me
this
beer
could
be
pretty
darn
good
if
they
turned
down
the
sweetness
and
spices
a
bit
unless
they
change
up
the
recipe
or
make
a
different
version
of
this
brew
i
probably
wont
be
picking
it
up

pumpkin
and
this
one
was
certainly
not
an
exception
to
that
rule
far
too
much
pie
spicecinnamon
but
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
blackcompg
tastes
like
fall
but
in
a
way
i
wasnt
expecting
works
far
better
than
most
other
attempts
at
the
pumpkin
ale
style
in
fact
it
just
might
be
my
favorite
would
pair
beautifully
with
autumn
desserts
for
me
southern
tier
is
hit
or
miss
this
one
is
actually
very
good
first
off
the
smell
on
this
one
is
amazing
i
smell
vanilla
nutmeg
clove
and
of
course
pumpkin
oh
yeah
and
cinnamon
the
head
was
small
and
dissipated
quickly
the
taste
is
cinnamon
upfront
followed
by
pumpkin
the
alcohol
is
there
but
it
is
fairly
well
hidden
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
but
not
the
best
that
distinction
falls
to
schlaflys
pumpkin
ale
still
if
you
dont
fall
within
the
states
that
schlaflys
distributes
to
this
is
a
good
second
o
overall
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
at
all
although
its
not
my
favorite
style
i
would
drink
this
again
and
again
o
this
is
one
seasonal
pumpkin
beer
i
look
forward
to
each
year
and
i
was
not
disappointed
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
for
me
as
i
enjoy
the
meld
of
flavors
that
develop
after
each
sip
definitely
one
of
the
more
complex
tasting
pumpkin
beers
not
all
spice
up
front
compared
to
previous
years
this
one
seems
a
bit
more
heavy
on
vanilla
and
a
little
more
creamy
in
mouthfeel
but
overall
an
awesome
beer
if
you
can
find
it
its
a
transparent
amberorange
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
a
few
streams
of
carbonation
bubble
to
the
top
i
smell
pumpkins
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
creamed
corn
i
taste
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
and
thankfully
no
creamed
corn
the
sweetness
is
well
balanced
with
the
pumpkin
spices
it
has
a
medium
body
and
i
think
it
could
be
carbonated
a
little
more
alcohol
at
8
is
hidden
nicely
i
may
get
it
once
a
year
just
to
have
during
the
season
ill
have
to
try
other
pumpkin
ales
to
have
get
some
perspective
on
the
style
overall
good
but
not
overly
impressed
o
simply
outstanding
and
thats
all
i
have
to
say
about
that
the
smell
is
magnificent
unfortunately
the
appearance
and
taste
dont
quite
stack
up
to
the
expectation
it
sets
o
not
as
thick
as
other
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
its
decent
i
am
not
into
pumpkin
beers
but
because
this
one
is
from
southern
tier
thought
i
would
give
it
a
try
its
good
but
not
one
i
would
buy
again
just
because
i
am
not
into
the
whole
pumpkin
thing
overall
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
that
is
great
for
drinking
on
a
cold
fall
day
so
far
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
think
i
prefer
it
a
little
thicker
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
more
like
hoppin
frogs
which
i
think
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
this
season
but
it
is
only
halfway
through
september
first
tried
at
the
brewery
prior
to
2011
release
good
then
and
good
now
im
not
a
fan
of
flavored
beer
but
it
seems
appropriate
to
enjoy
this
one
in
anticipation
of
the
fall
ive
tried
several
pumpkin
brews
but
like
this
one
the
best
it
has
the
sweet
qualities
present
in
many
of
st
imperials
and
pushes
the
pumpkin
flavor
and
color
forward
better
than
any
other
product
ive
sampled
o
pretty
decent
pumpkin
ale
with
most
of
the
common
ingredients
and
flavors
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
be
overly
spiced
like
others
but
is
very
sweet
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
but
i
can
definitely
see
why
it
is
for
others
i
finally
managed
to
get
my
grubby
hands
on
this
beer
after
reading
so
many
rave
reviews
i
am
happy
to
report
that
it
did
not
disappoint
in
the
slightest
for
me
every
pumpkin
beer
i
drink
will
be
compared
to
schlaflys
my
personal
favorite
this
one
while
not
as
good
as
schlaflys
in
my
opinion
was
good
enough
and
different
enough
to
make
me
want
to
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
im
saving
one
for
halloween
night
boo
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
to
date
on
the
thin
side
but
good
pumpkinspicebooze
balance
overall
this
blew
me
away
i
have
to
find
more
of
this
beer
o
drinkability
is
not
high
but
overall
this
was
good
22oz
bottle
was
a
bit
too
much
though
o
im
struggling
to
understand
why
so
many
people
rate
this
highly
i
was
really
hoping
to
like
it
since
its
readily
available
here
but
after
trying
a
really
great
example
of
the
style
ccb
good
gourd
recently
this
is
almost
offensively
bad
i
even
checked
with
the
store
its
this
years
release
what
a
huge
letdown
overall
one
of
the
best
pumpkins
ive
had
its
very
very
good
not
at
all
what
i
expected
actually
but
i
think
this
pumpkin
has
so
much
balance
very
well
done
o
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
but
could
have
been
better
o
still
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
definitely
affordable
for
what
you
get
a
tasteful
use
of
pumpkin
and
spice
but
with
a
different
take
on
the
style
than
what
ive
seen
at
least
compared
to
the
14
or
so
commercial
examples
that
i
have
access
to
here
in
maine
o
this
was
certainly
worth
the
wait
probably
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
of
this
o
wow
amazing
beer
been
waiting
to
try
this
one
not
disappointed
at
all
if
you
are
thinking
about
trying
punmpkin
ales
or
intrigued
by
the
style
then
give
this
a
shot
o
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
representation
of
the
style
on
draft
i
cn
say
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
tasted
all
in
all
pumking
fits
into
the
second
tier
of
my
patented
pumpkin
beer
hierarchy
next
to
dfh
punkin
and
above
the
weyerbacher
the
top
tier
remains
static
frogs
hollow
imperial
pumpkin
ale
by
hoppin
frog
and
devious
imperial
pumpkin
by
bethlehem
brew
works
i
think
this
years
version
is
much
better
than
last
year
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
but
a
solid
competitor
an
automatic
f
o
its
just
not
fall
until
you
have
a
pumking
i
dont
like
a
lot
of
sts
brews
but
i
cant
go
without
this
one
always
a
treat
this
rereview
has
me
raising
my
old
score
this
ones
a
winner
i
am
very
disappointed
but
i
see
others
like
it
that
is
fine
but
not
the
beer
that
is
says
on
the
bottle
this
is
awesome
beer
for
the
winter
just
needs
a
little
more
malty
taste
cheers
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
not
too
sweet
and
it
really
gave
the
feel
of
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
i
need
more
regarding
the
actual
drinkability
when
i
had
this
on
tap
last
winter
it
was
served
in
11oz
portions
and
rightfully
so
this
is
definitely
a
sip
enjoy
so
share
that
big
bottle
with
someone
this
is
a
powerful
pumpkin
ale
just
as
youd
expect
from
southern
tier
my
friends
and
i
describe
it
to
newcomers
as
tossing
a
pumpkin
pie
in
a
blender
and
hitting
puree
its
very
spicy
and
very
sweet
not
to
mention
somewhat
strong
too
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
imho
one
of
those
beers
you
pour
in
a
glass
and
enjoy
slowly
like
a
port
wine
definitely
something
to
try
if
you
are
in
to
pumpkin
brews
it
finishes
with
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
a
little
cinnomon
and
some
other
dry
spices
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
sweet
and
spicyness
leave
a
great
aftertaste
o
not
that
great
of
a
pumpkin
beer
treat
and
schlafly
pumpkin
blow
this
one
out
of
the
water
i
would
pass
on
this
if
offered
again
not
recommended
carbonation
is
moderately
lively
crisper
and
more
refreshing
than
id
anticipated
finishes
surprisingly
dry
without
too
much
lingering
and
no
cloying
this
is
a
fairly
unsweet
beer
for
southern
tier
although
it
is
sweeter
than
many
other
pumpkin
beers
definitely
one
you
need
to
try
if
youre
into
this
style
flavor
is
sugary
it
just
isnt
great
the
pumkin
is
fine
but
it
is
overspiced
and
oversweet
candy
corn
mixed
with
pumpkin
pie
comes
to
mind
hilarious
that
this
is
considered
the
pinnacle
of
this
style
the
hops
also
just
really
dont
work
here
o
i
now
see
why
this
is
the
quintessential
pumpkin
beer
and
very
glad
i
tried
it
this
beer
is
great
not
too
much
spice
and
not
too
much
sweetness
but
still
big
on
flavor
every
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
is
too
rich
or
not
flavorful
enough
too
thin
or
heavy
in
body
but
this
beer
strikes
the
perfect
balance
truly
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
of
all
time
if
youre
really
in
a
mood
to
travel
to
pumpkinland
this
is
arguably
the
1
choice
id
rate
dogfish
heads
punkin
ale
at
a
close
2
easier
to
casually
down
1
or
2
of
those
whereas
this
you
really
need
to
be
in
the
zone
to
take
on
a
pumking
bomber
punkin
ale
edges
out
pumking
in
the
spice
department
but
pumking
takes
the
cake
in
true
pumpkin
pie
flavor
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
try
several
other
pumpkin
ales
already
this
fall
and
all
were
fairly
decent
smuttynoses
offering
probably
being
the
best
out
of
that
batch
where
do
i
start
with
pumking
this
is
not
for
the
fainthearted
first
of
all
this
is
a
thick
strong
concoction
that
will
leave
you
feeling
like
you
just
devoured
the
tastiest
pumpkin
pie
of
all
time
it
has
a
good
balance
of
spices
and
a
thick
layer
of
caramel
the
pumpkin
taste
is
perfect
and
the
abv
on
this
bomber
is
8
6
so
you
will
be
buzzed
if
you
are
a
lightweight
drink
responsibly
the
guy
that
orders
for
my
area
in
metro
chicago
failed
to
order
these
last
year
and
i
had
to
order
them
at
a
high
price
from
a
couple
stores
out
east
this
time
they
are
not
playing
around
and
dicarlos
up
in
mundelein
managed
to
get
like
20
cases
lets
send
southern
tier
a
message
that
this
is
a
hit
much
like
punkin
ale
and
have
them
ship
more
of
these
bad
boys
out
here
asap
cheers
to
all
and
may
you
all
enjoy
this
wonderful
fall
season
arguably
the
best
time
of
year
for
beer
aficionados
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
a
decent
size
white
head
the
smell
is
strongly
like
pumpkin
some
spices
very
similar
to
pumkin
pie
the
taste
is
strongly
similar
to
pumkin
pie
creamy
lots
of
pumkins
flavors
a
bit
of
cinimmon
good
strong
flavor
very
nice
on
the
palette
overall
a
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
almost
as
good
as
dogfish
head
pours
an
orange
color
w
a
bubbly
thin
off
white
head
good
carbonation
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
beer
is
very
clear
and
easy
to
see
through
nose
is
fantastic
although
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
pumpkin
caramel
gingerbread
vanilla
if
i
closed
my
eyes
i
would
swear
i
was
smelling
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
fairly
close
to
the
nose
but
the
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
come
out
a
little
more
along
w
some
malt
the
taste
is
not
quite
up
to
the
level
of
the
nose
but
its
pretty
close
still
a
4
is
all
i
can
give
this
category
feel
is
medium
and
very
sweet
but
it
goes
down
smooth
just
the
same
very
nice
just
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
finishes
fairly
wet
with
a
nice
chestnutnutmegpumpkincinnamon
aftertaste
overall
this
is
definitely
a
different
animal
than
the
other
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
its
like
literally
eating
and
smelling
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
you
can
even
smell
and
taste
the
little
burned
areas
of
the
graham
cracker
crust
nice
i
enjoyed
this
one
cheers
o
first
off
this
may
just
be
my
favorite
seasonal
beer
it
is
a
flavorpacked
and
interesting
pour
the
beers
only
trait
that
may
hinder
on
people
is
the
amount
of
spice
and
sweetness
packed
into
it
overall
a
great
pumpkin
ale
thanks
to
merc7186
for
this
one
o
ive
had
this
now
for
the
last
two
years
and
think
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
just
a
huge
amount
of
pumpkin
pie
in
the
aroma
and
taste
while
a
bit
early
for
the
puca
as
all
hallows
eve
still
blows
in
the
wind
for
a
few
nights
we
tried
this
bomber
to
welcome
in
coming
of
the
autumnal
equinox
it
appears
offamber
like
a
leaf
two
weeks
before
dropping
onto
the
front
lawn
it
smells
like
mamas
kitchen
in
late
november
around
447
p
m
just
before
the
pumking
pie
comes
out
of
the
oven
the
rooty
pumpkin
flavors
are
abundant
but
not
overwhelming
as
they
are
balanced
with
nutmeg
clove
and
caramel
just
like
mamas
pie
puca
indeed
carried
us
on
the
journey
of
our
lives
forever
changed
overall
its
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
would
look
forward
to
enjoying
once
or
twice
per
season
the
rest
will
either
be
dumped
or
used
for
some
kind
of
cooking
maybe
a
brine
o
sweet
and
underattenuated
but
it
works
4
5
this
is
exactly
how
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
should
smell
taste
and
feel
loaded
with
spices
and
sweet
caramel
malt
while
maintaining
good
balance
and
drinkability
this
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
a
pumpkin
or
looking
to
get
in
the
mood
for
autumn
absolutely
delicious
despite
my
critiques
top
notch
dfhs
punkin
did
better
on
the
spice
blend
there
is
a
lingering
bitterness
from
hops
and
spice
aftertaste
overall
an
awesome
beer
the
dry
finish
actually
makes
this
more
drinkable
than
their
other
rich
dessert
beers
i
think
i
can
drink
this
one
alone
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
although
the
list
is
admittedly
short
i
dont
intend
on
drinking
too
many
more
of
these
this
year
but
i
will
sure
as
hell
be
picking
some
of
it
up
again
next
year
impeccable
shot
at
imperializing
an
autumn
classic
smells
unlike
any
pumpkin
beer
out
there
overall
very
creative
and
delicious
a
hair
away
from
being
5s
across
the
board
o
great
pumpkin
beer
with
amazing
pumpkin
flavor
it
can
totally
be
seen
like
eating
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
great
fall
beer
though
with
the
amount
of
cinnamon
i
probably
would
only
have
1
1
being
at
least
a
22oz
bomber
well
done
southern
tier
big
thanks
to
mjtiernan
for
sending
this
out
in
a
trade
poured
from
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
color
is
a
shade
of
copper
with
amber
highlights
pretty
clear
with
a
half
finger
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
and
the
beer
looking
flat
smell
is
of
sugar
and
spice
and
everything
nice
taste
has
cinnamon
sugar
graham
cracker
crust
hint
of
allspice
and
booze
is
well
hidden
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
with
all
the
flavor
you
dont
notice
it
as
much
overall
a
very
good
and
very
sweeet
beer
now
if
only
they
could
figure
out
to
put
a
big
head
on
it
it
would
be
like
having
whipped
topping
on
my
pie
well
i
think
this
beer
needs
to
be
renamed
pumpkin
pie
but
it
delivers
what
it
says
my
only
thinking
though
is
that
it
seems
so
blatantly
obvious
i
wonder
if
this
has
artificial
flavoring
in
it
crazy
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
it
has
a
very
nice
and
interesting
flavor
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
more
bold
pumpkin
beers
that
are
out
there
also
i
thought
that
this
has
more
of
the
actual
pumpkin
flavor
versus
fall
spices
which
a
lot
of
other
pumpkin
beers
focus
on
i
feel
like
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
and
it
is
perfect
for
this
season
if
you
are
into
pumpkin
beers
or
trying
them
out
this
one
is
a
must
have
might
be
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
overall
i
believe
this
beer
is
a
little
too
hyped
up
it
is
kind
of
a
novelty
but
it
has
too
many
flaws
in
my
eyes
to
consider
buying
it
again
pumpkin
pie
orange
in
color
with
a
light
haze
poured
with
a
short
foamy
white
head
that
slowly
dissipated
sweet
pumpkin
pielike
aroma
with
cinnamon
brown
sugar
rumlike
sweetness
nutmeg
and
spice
light
bodied
with
a
buttery
smooth
oily
feel
sweet
malty
pumpkin
flavor
from
beginning
to
end
this
is
literally
like
drinking
pumpkin
pie
without
the
whipped
cream
texture
thins
at
the
finish
unmasking
the
higher
abv
but
the
cinnamon
and
spice
subdue
the
alcoholic
heat
a
truly
unique
and
noteworthy
pumpkin
ale
overall
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
to
split
amongst
friends
or
family
while
enjoying
dinner
or
some
pumpkin
pie
overall
its
on
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
oone
of
my
favorite
fall
beers
has
great
flavor
and
aroma
o
id
heard
a
lot
of
good
things
about
the
pumking
and
perhaps
had
inflated
expectations
its
radically
different
from
any
other
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
which
makes
me
recommend
it
on
that
alone
that
being
said
its
boozy
and
imbalanced
is
it
bad
no
is
it
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
even
today
not
even
close
this
is
a
once
a
year
brew
for
a
reason
i
dont
think
more
than
one
of
these
bad
boys
is
gonna
be
on
my
fall
list
that
being
said
its
very
unique
and
its
nice
to
try
something
new
every
one
in
a
while
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
lives
up
to
its
name
ive
had
this
beer
numerous
times
in
the
past
and
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
it
until
now
this
is
a
well
known
selection
from
southern
tier
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
and
definitely
an
assertive
beer
for
the
style
this
one
garners
a
lovehate
reaction
from
people
because
we
all
know
thats
the
reputation
of
pumpkin
ales
you
either
love
them
or
you
hate
them
the
gap
between
the
two
may
be
a
little
wider
for
this
one
since
its
so
bold
i
always
look
forward
to
its
release
each
year
o
man
i
love
this
beer
boozy
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
yum
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
this
is
probably
the
best
ive
had
overall
ive
only
had
a
handful
of
pumpkin
beers
in
the
past
but
this
one
is
among
the
best
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
snifter
clear
orange
pour
with
minimal
head
the
aroma
is
strong
pumpkin
pie
spices
the
pumpkin
pie
spice
is
prominant
vanilla
and
of
course
pumkin
it
finishes
with
sweet
pumkin
the
body
is
light
low
carbonation
no
hint
of
alcohol
while
i
am
not
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
this
dissapointed
me
there
have
been
a
ton
of
threads
about
how
great
this
beer
was
but
sadly
it
did
not
work
for
me
i
like
this
beer
for
what
it
reminds
me
of
cool
weather
fall
surrounded
by
changing
colored
leaves
you
cant
expect
to
drink
a
fall
beer
without
strong
spices
of
the
season
id
recommend
this
beer
to
friends
for
sure
and
after
trying
other
pumpkin
ales
all
season
id
rank
pumking
as
tied
for
my
favorite
with
smashed
pumpkin
and
followed
by
heavy
seas
greater
pumpkin
and
punkin
overall
i
was
pretty
disappointed
lots
of
people
told
me
this
was
the
best
pumpkin
beer
out
there
so
i
had
to
try
it
i
guess
ill
add
this
to
my
way
overhyped
beers
just
tasted
artificial
and
overspiced
to
me
id
like
to
see
a
much
more
balanced
beer
most
of
the
other
pumpkin
beers
tasted
seemed
to
taste
mostly
like
beer
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
or
spice
this
felt
like
it
delivered
and
certainly
lives
up
to
its
name
as
the
pumking
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
extremely
tasty
and
well
balanced
quite
a
spicy
beer
thats
taste
is
almost
over
the
top
but
maintains
decent
drinkability
for
me
this
is
a
once
a
season
beer
and
again
im
glad
that
i
split
the
bomber
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
appreciate
the
creativity
involved
in
this
brew
pours
a
clear
light
copper
orange
with
a
1
inch
fizzy
orangewhite
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
this
one
on
the
drink
down
kind
of
a
disappointing
appearance
smell
is
very
complex
with
caramel
malt
biscuits
actual
pumpkin
puree
and
a
wide
array
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
cinnamon
clove
nutmeg
taste
is
of
maltbreadbiscuitcrust
unsweetened
pumpkin
puree
brown
sugar
and
the
aforementioned
spices
there
is
a
slight
spice
bitterness
that
sticks
the
the
tongue
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
that
is
somewhat
different
that
i
was
expecting
i
was
thinking
that
this
could
be
a
creamy
sweet
pumpkin
milkshake
of
a
beer
but
i
like
this
one
as
it
is
i
do
have
to
say
it
does
have
a
very
nice
appearance
and
potent
smell
of
october
or
halloween
i
do
not
know
why
i
continue
to
take
enormous
gulps
my
lips
are
all
sticky
and
i
think
the
alcohol
is
going
to
my
head
i
recommend
this
beer
to
the
person
who
wants
to
get
drunk
asap
and
is
dressed
in
a
halloween
costume
o
ive
shared
this
beer
with
enough
people
to
know
that
it
is
generally
well
regarded
even
though
it
it
not
my
thing
my
preference
would
be
to
back
off
on
the
spices
and
let
that
rich
smooth
and
sweet
base
beer
shine
through
a
bit
more
and
then
to
further
move
the
spice
character
away
from
nutmeg
and
more
towards
ginger
and
vanilla
but
it
is
a
lovely
beer
and
strong
enough
to
be
a
sipper
to
share
with
several
others
especially
packaged
in
a
22
oz
bomber
very
warming
boozy
quality
with
an
overlycarbonated
soda
feel
to
it
a
nice
fuller
bodied
beer
that
can
use
with
less
carbonation
my
ride
with
púca
short
his
advice
to
try
the
other
pumpkins
out
there
pours
a
very
transparent
copper
orange
color
that
had
carbonation
throughout
drinking
it
one
and
a
half
finger
head
that
didnt
last
long
and
didnt
leave
much
lacing
when
i
smelled
it
nutmeg
was
the
most
dominate
scent
then
cinnomin
then
alcohol
when
i
took
a
sip
i
tasted
cinnomin
first
however
followed
by
malt
nutmeg
and
and
unpleasing
alcoholic
aftertaste
thick
and
dry
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
beer
but
to
be
honest
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
i
will
be
buying
it
again
but
at
10
a
bottle
at
my
local
store
im
going
to
be
sticking
with
dogfish
head
punkin
ale
through
most
of
this
fall
o
if
someone
asked
would
i
drink
this
again
my
answer
would
be
yes
cause
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
i
would
say
no
if
i
were
looking
for
a
pumpkin
flavored
beer
with
that
wow
factor
overall
one
of
the
most
memorable
beers
ive
ever
had
such
a
distinct
yummy
taste
one
of
the
best
seasonals
ive
ever
had
and
i
would
definitely
try
again
and
plan
on
doing
it
soon
best
pumkin
beer
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
modest
pumpkin
beer
it
is
as
much
a
beer
as
it
is
about
pumpkins
i
wonder
what
a
beer
would
be
like
with
a
more
aggressive
pumpkin
flavor
this
one
i
will
have
again
very
unique
smell
for
me
which
ended
up
being
a
cross
between
eggnog
and
graham
crackers
not
too
sweet
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
overall
crazy
good
i
must
say
kudos
to
southern
tier
a
perfect
option
for
a
chilly
septemberoctober
night
this
was
my
first
time
having
pumking
and
i
was
really
impressed
its
really
competing
with
dfhs
punkin
and
weyerbachers
imperial
pumpkin
for
first
place
in
the
pumpkin
ale
category
for
me
ill
definitely
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
picked
this
up
at
julios
today
been
looking
up
to
this
one
for
so
long
not
exactly
what
expected
pours
a
coppery
dull
orange
that
i
have
never
seen
in
any
other
beer
a
lack
of
head
and
lacing
bring
the
appearance
down
a
bit
smells
and
tastes
of
an
extremely
strong
pumpkin
and
spice
it
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
personally
but
that
is
personal
taste
it
definitely
lives
up
to
the
pumpkin
taste
and
style
though
it
literally
tastes
and
smells
of
a
yankee
candle
pumpkin
candle
with
a
bit
of
malts
and
tiny
hops
certainly
dominated
by
pumpkin
spice
though
a
bit
too
much
nutmeg
and
sweetness
in
here
for
me
mouthfeel
is
good
here
the
lack
of
head
is
deceiving
because
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
with
a
creamy
medium
body
drinkability
brings
in
my
personal
taste
here
i
could
not
stand
this
taste
for
more
than
one
glass
of
this
it
is
overwhelming
for
me
if
you
like
pumpkin
and
spice
than
this
is
for
you
it
was
not
for
me
as
much
as
i
thought
it
would
be
this
was
an
interesting
brew
i
loved
the
color
of
this
first
and
foremost
it
was
a
beautiful
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
white
crown
the
nose
was
unbelievable
this
is
such
a
fragrant
beer
you
get
the
pumpkin
the
spice
everything
in
your
face
i
split
this
bottle
with
a
friend
and
it
took
me
half
of
my
glass
to
wrap
my
head
around
what
was
going
on
with
this
this
actually
tasted
like
pumpkin
while
it
had
the
a
lot
of
the
spiciness
typical
of
this
type
of
beer
this
was
just
different
than
anything
else
sort
of
a
pumpkin
pie
thing
going
it
was
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
on
this
this
feels
great
in
your
mouth
its
smooth
almost
like
a
stout
absolutely
beautiful
im
glad
i
have
another
bottle
of
this
left
very
light
amber
color
with
a
white
head
that
sort
of
diminishes
more
quickly
than
preferred
smell
is
amazing
with
hints
of
something
like
butterscotch
and
burnt
sugar
and
graham
crackers
taste
follows
the
nose
and
incredibly
smooth
sweet
but
not
overly
so
and
lightbodied
though
it
seems
to
go
right
with
this
one
no
hints
of
the
8
8
abv
here
this
is
what
a
pumpkin
beer
should
taste
like
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
it
was
a
bit
thin
and
the
aroma
and
taste
reminded
me
of
25
packets
of
oatmeal
which
i
made
growing
up
however
the
pumpkin
was
real
and
noticeable
a
super
fresh
example
of
a
beer
ive
been
dying
to
try
since
i
missed
it
last
year
a
very
successful
pumpkin
beer
but
i
have
yet
to
find
one
that
is
excellent
what
makes
this
beer
so
special
is
the
attention
to
detail
what
blows
me
away
every
time
is
the
whipped
cream
i
have
no
idea
how
they
do
it
but
the
flavor
is
seriously
here
this
is
what
people
look
for
in
shorts
beers
but
southern
tier
really
delivers
here
pours
a
very
pretty
clear
burnt
orange
with
a
two
finger
head
that
turns
to
a
thin
lace
of
thin
bubbles
and
slimes
across
the
glass
the
smell
wow
it
smells
like
a
well
spiced
pumpkin
pie
fresh
out
of
the
oven
with
subtle
scents
of
candy
corn
the
taste
offers
the
same
warm
pumpkin
pie
generous
spice
and
a
faint
layer
of
alcohol
medium
on
feel
nice
smooth
delicious
this
is
what
a
pumpkin
ale
should
taste
like
a
friggin
pumpkin
this
truly
is
a
great
beer
look
forward
to
it
every
fall
o
under
the
fall
pumpkin
style
this
ranks
among
the
top
that
ive
ever
had
pumpkin
seems
like
a
very
hard
flavor
to
harness
and
southern
tier
has
clearly
mastered
it
this
beer
is
great
standing
alone
but
would
make
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
at
the
thanksgiving
table
its
definitely
got
a
jelly
bellywilly
wonka
fullflavor
experience
going
on
pours
a
deep
orange
color
with
little
head
very
still
looking
beer
this
is
a
2010
release
aromas
are
of
sweet
pumpkin
pie
delectable
and
syrupy
nose
flavor
is
a
perfect
match
chewy
graham
cracker
and
sweet
strong
pumpkin
candy
spice
level
is
much
subdued
since
the
fresh
release
i
love
this
beer
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
the
light
bitterness
dissapears
and
the
rich
sweet
pielike
character
shines
through
definitely
the
best
pumpkin
beer
on
the
market
from
beginning
to
end
this
beer
is
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
flavored
beverage
ive
ever
had
shipyard
pumpkin
ale
is
great
too
but
pumking
blows
it
out
of
the
water
this
beer
is
not
too
heavy
its
a
perfect
size
to
drink
at
an
event
the
only
bad
thing
about
it
is
that
it
might
lose
its
chill
after
holding
on
to
it
for
a
while
but
so
does
any
large
beer
of
the
same
container
overall
i
think
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
would
make
a
perfect
compliment
to
a
thanksgiving
dinner
with
perhaps
a
second
bottle
around
to
pair
with
dessert
and
then
a
nice
fire
to
fall
asleep
in
front
of
ah
overallsomething
might
be
wrong
here
ive
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
and
was
looking
forward
to
it
but
it
was
just
messy
is
it
not
good
because
its
a
year
old
did
i
get
a
bad
bottle
not
sure
but
i
dont
think
i
can
finish
this
bomber
very
dissipointed
o
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
to
date
i
cant
imagine
it
getting
much
better
than
this
i
could
drink
this
all
throughout
the
fall
and
look
forward
to
taking
part
in
this
experience
again
soon
overall
i
really
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
some
may
call
pumpkin
beers
a
novelty
but
i
say
its
a
now
pretty
wellestablished
style
and
this
might
be
the
best
of
them
o
pretty
awesome
beer
super
pumped
i
had
it
on
tap
the
pumking
rocks
this
brew
has
a
medium
body
and
thick
viscosity
with
a
very
smooth
slightly
bubbly
feel
overall
this
is
on
the
extreme
end
of
the
pumpkin
scale
for
a
pumpkin
ale
if
you
like
a
hint
of
pumpkin
in
your
halloween
ale
this
will
knock
you
over
however
if
you
want
to
taste
bold
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
this
is
your
ale
o
very
well
balanced
pumpkin
ale
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
tasted
abv
is
well
hidden
but
does
come
through
in
the
taste
as
you
continue
drinking
the
ale
i
would
highly
recommend
it
heady
start
as
the
foam
almost
crests
over
the
top
of
the
glass
bright
golden
orange
color
smells
of
pumpkin
bread
and
vanilla
wafers
a
very
sweet
nose
very
smooth
big
body
pumpkin
to
start
then
sweetness
soon
the
spices
kick
in
as
well
as
the
hops
alcohol
does
not
chime
in
until
a
few
sips
in
and
quickly
warms
the
mouth
a
slow
sipper
due
to
the
more
robust
flavors
of
spice
and
malt
sweetness
the
alcohol
as
well
certainly
worth
a
go
i
bet
some
pork
loin
would
love
to
be
brined
in
this
overall
pretty
good
somewhat
sweet
although
less
pumpkiny
than
i
expected
its
like
drinking
a
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ever
most
pumpkin
beers
do
not
have
this
favor
my
friends
and
i
love
this
seasonal
release
southern
tier
doe
not
make
any
beer
in
this
class
of
brew
after
one
taste
you
will
be
a
punking
fan
the
beer
pours
out
as
a
clear
copper
color
the
smell
of
spice
and
brown
sugar
rise
from
the
glass
along
with
some
pumpkin
and
other
seasonal
spices
the
taste
of
the
beer
reminded
me
of
a
ginger
snap
cookie
but
in
a
liquified
form
its
spicy
and
sweet
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
thicker
i
think
but
overall
its
a
really
good
pumpkin
ale
and
i
enjoy
it
every
time
i
have
it
delicious
pumpkiny
and
spicy
but
not
overkill
a
very
nice
mediumrich
beer
good
for
a
fall
night
or
an
afternoon
of
carving
pumpkins
nice
paired
with
a
hearty
stew
or
a
few
gingerbread
cookies
a
bit
pricy
at
810
dollars
for
a
2
serving
bottle
worth
it
if
you
have
it
once
a
year
as
a
seasonal
treat
im
glad
i
gave
this
one
another
shot
as
i
really
did
enjoy
it
this
time
around
its
now
a
favorite
in
a
style
that
sadly
is
only
around
for
a
couple
months
a
year
this
ones
going
down
the
drain
again
im
glad
other
people
like
this
stuff
so
that
i
can
easily
send
out
the
couple
remaining
bottles
as
extras
a
beer
to
drink
in
small
quantities
great
for
sharing
great
for
dessert
a
winning
beer
overall
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
and
i
really
cant
imagine
one
being
any
better
i
like
pumpkin
pie
a
lot
but
i
would
take
this
over
pumpkin
pie
the
gold
standard
for
the
style
no
doubt
about
that
overall
an
absolutely
stunning
rendition
of
a
fall
favorite
while
a
lot
of
examples
of
this
style
come
off
contrivedfake
tasting
this
one
rings
true
and
as
natural
as
can
be
you
can
actually
taste
a
heavy
whipped
cream
dollop
on
the
top
and
the
flakey
buttery
crust
too
just
perfect
the
only
thing
i
could
ask
for
is
a
little
more
of
a
creamier
mouth
feel
the
aroma
and
taste
probably
gets
better
as
it
warms
a
little
but
i
drank
it
too
fast
to
find
out
o
an
amazing
brew
superbly
engineered
and
executed
it
is
unabashed
intensity
at
its
best
and
mediocrity
is
clearly
exiled
in
every
aspect
i
can
see
how
this
may
be
a
little
much
for
the
traditional
or
timid
but
thats
the
point
this
is
unbridled
inhibition
passion
and
creative
catharsis
brace
yourself
for
an
icon
of
pumpkinsanity
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
pretty
phenomenal
i
always
look
forward
to
october
when
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
and
not
a
year
goes
by
that
i
dont
celebrate
the
arrival
of
autumn
with
at
least
1
bottle
of
pumking
the
cpj
great
job
southern
tier
d
awesome
beer
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
has
a
love
for
this
style
d
the
alcohol
is
not
even
noticeable
great
brew
from
southern
tier
never
let
down
the
draft
variety
of
this
beer
is
just
unbelievably
rewarding
the
color
is
deep
amber
and
smell
fragrant
smelling
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
most
notable
being
allspice
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
grainy
and
goes
down
smooth
and
gets
tastier
as
it
warms
as
you
drink
down
one
the
warmth
arrives
slowly
as
the
high
alcohol
begins
to
kick
in
the
finish
is
like
a
full
taste
of
pumpkin
pieincluding
crust
it
is
tough
to
put
down
more
than
two
10
ounce
goblets
at
one
sitting
as
this
is
like
drinking
dessert
i
cant
wait
till
next
fall
to
test
the
2011
batch
this
is
another
outstanding
southern
tier
product
as
all
their
beers
get
better
with
time
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
as
good
as
a
pumpkin
beer
can
be
cant
have
too
many
but
a
couple
will
do
the
trick
overall
the
best
pumpkin
ive
had
cant
wait
for
next
year
skal
drinkability
this
one
is
real
smooth
fresh
and
aged
great
with
dessert
or
on
its
own
as
dessert
i
could
drink
a
couple
bombers
but
ill
stick
to
one
very
good
flavors
dont
wanna
overdo
it
on
your
mouth
after
this
one
get
a
nice
imperial
stout
or
something
of
the
like
to
keep
up
the
big
beer
profile
and
make
it
an
early
night
m
i
perfer
the
smuttynose
pumpkin
over
this
one
as
its
much
easier
to
drink
much
less
sweet
however
southern
tiers
pumpkin
is
a
nice
dessert
beer
this
is
definitely
not
a
flavor
profile
that
will
agree
with
everyone
but
i
enjoyed
it
i
dont
normally
like
this
style
of
beer
but
this
one
i
like
a
bunch
other
than
a
friends
homebrew
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
pours
an
orangish
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
pumpkin
cardamom
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
tastes
of
a
pumpkin
pie
explosion
with
tons
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
but
too
many
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
light
drinkability
is
okay
3
5
d
i
expect
st
to
get
this
brew
back
on
track
next
year
if
they
dont
ill
be
incredibly
pissed
considering
i
love
pumpkinpie
spice
brews
and
so
few
quality
ones
exist
poured
from
bomber
into
dimple
glass
wow
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
it
felt
like
i
was
eating
a
pumpkin
pie
when
drinking
this
special
brew
pours
harvest
orange
with
a
small
fizzy
offwhite

on

aroma
is
heavy
malt
cookie
cereal
straw
biscuit
average
hops
grass
herbs
average
yeast
dough
leaves
with
notes
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
allspice
nutmeg
and
brown
sugar
there
is
an
interesting
mix
of
lightly
buttered
biscuits
and
sugar
cookies
that
permeates
above
all
the
typical
pumpkin
beer
spices
that
is
rather
intriguing
and
inviting
in
a
raw
dough
kind
of
way
the
pumpkin
is
not
too
much
nor
too
little
yet
is
much
more
present
than
most
pumpkin
beers
medium
bodied
aided
by
the
uncharacteristically
high
alcohol
content
alcoholic

that
fizzles

rapidly
and
a
chalky

dry
finish
long

and
bitterness
i
am
quite
taken
by
this
pumpkin
beer
as
it
seems
to
nail
the
one
thing
others
cannot
it
gives
the
pumpkin
flavor
along
with
spices
typical
but
also
adds
a
freshly
baked
crust
to
the
aroma
and
flavor
but
that
taste
wow
it
can
be
broken
into
two
distinct
parts
first
there
is
a
hoppy
ipa
with
citrus
and
a
dry
mouthfeel
but
the
ipa
is
quickly
overwhelmed
by
a
very
heavy
sweet
and
spicey
pumpkin
finish
if
youd
like
to
drink
your
desert
on
thanksgiving
then
id
highly
recommend
pumking
i
liked
this
beer
last
year
what
happened
maybe
this
would
be
better
right
off
the
bottling
line
but
in
its
current
state
i
thought
it
was
unbalanced
in
favor
of
spice
and
hop
flavors
a
little
more
pumpkin
in
the
mix
and
a
smoother
mouthfeel
would
encourage
me
to
rate
it
a
bit
higher
overall
its
just
average
in
drinkability
the
high
alcohol
content
for
one
but
more
importantly
just
like
i
couldnt
eat
too
much
of
a
pumpkin
pie
in
one
sitting
i
got
a
little
tired
of
this
too
some
dangerous
drinkability
here
as
always
creamy
and
slick
but
less
cloying
than
previous
versions
mellow
fine
textured
carbonation
still
indulgent
and
dessertlike
with
of
course
huge
flavors
and
aromas
overall
onpar
with
previous
versions
but
certainly
a
bit
different
a
masterpiece
of
seasonal
enjoyment
once
again
d
i
really
enjoyed
the
pumpkin
flavours
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
any
pumpkin
ale
fan
however
the
bitterness
was
a
little
much
at
times
i
had
to
crack
another
beer
halfway
through
the
bomber
in
order
to
finish
it
most
certainly
couldnt
have
more
than
one
bomber
d
overall
this
makes
a
great
fallwinter
beer
alcohol
is
wellhidden
for
9abv
definitely
will
look
for
this
next
year
when
it
comes
out
to
try
it
fresh
d
almost
a
chore
to
drink
while
i
like
the
aroma
and
the
feel
the
taste
was
just
wrong
i
generally
dont
care
for
spiced
ales
but
i
was
ready
for
this
to
be
an
exception
too
bad
ill
try
it
as
fresh
as
humanly
possible
next
year
to
see
if
it
was
an
issue
with
this
bottle
but
i
doubt
it
d
alcohol
is
totally
hidden
and
the
drying
quality
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
this
is
very
high
in
drinkability
easily
the
best
tasting
beer
by
southern
tier
i
remember
the
days
when
this
would
sell
out
in
august
or
september
and
not
be
around
for
halloween
i
stocked
up
and
saved
it
for
october
back
in
the
day
perfect
pumpkin
taste
and
aroma
tastes
more
like
pumpkin
pie
than
pumpkin
nice
malty
flavor
tops
it
off
off
tap
at
the
ugly
duckling
in
manlius
this
beer
which
id
been
seeking
on
tap
for
months
was
a
clear
orange
color
the
retention
of
the
khaki
head
as
a
skim
was
ok
and
it
left
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
fresh
and
inviting
blend
of
pumpkin
spices
boozy
warmth
caramel
malt
and
brown
sugar
the
flavors
were
just
amazing
homemade
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
the
pumpkin
tasted
fresh
the
spices
all
present
but
well
balanced
the
creaminess
of
the
mouthfeel
conducive
to
a
pielike
experience
wow
the
alcohol
was
also
well
concealed
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
rich
the
body
full
and
the
carbonation
light
i
believe
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
made
in
the
world
right
now
and
its
absolutely
worth
tracking
down
d
all
and
all
this
is
one
excellent
holiday
beer
with
smooth
and
sweet
qualities
that
make
it
a
great
addition
to
a
turkey
dinner
or
any
large
meal
cheers
to
the
innovations
of
the
craft
beer
movement
love
the
brewery
love
the
beers
name
but
the
overall
sweetness
of
the
beer
is
overwhelming
for
this
guy
d
the
alcohol
is
expertly
hidden
but
does
become
pleasantly
noticeable
at
the
very
end
i
tried
to
slowly
savor
this
but
next
to
impossible
wish
i
wouldve
gotten
ahold
of
a
bomber
of
this
edit
09nov2011
its
about
a
year
later
and
im
retrying
this
beer
i
still
like
it
and
im
not
changing
any
numbers
it
smells
so
good
the
rest
of
my
comments
and
ratings
stand
its
a
good
pumpkin
beer
for
sure
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
hands
down
this
beer
pours
an
orangey
amber
clear
with
a
little
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
smell
is
powerful
and
interesting
like
the
dessert
table
at
thanksgiving
nutmeg
cinnamon
some
minor
bitterness
and
of
course
pumpkin
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
some
sweetness
on
the
back
end
butterscotch
and
toffee
the
pumpkin
in
it
is
really
strong
that
it
almost
doesnt
taste
like
real
pumpkin
almost
a
bit
chemically
very
strong
spices
as
well
and
i
thought
i
tasted
a
bit
of
mint
this
full
bodied
beer
is
kind
of
a
relentless
assault
on
the
senses
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
delicate
decent
enough
though
delicious
must
try
the
taste
profile
is
gourmet
pumpkin
pie
depth
of
spice
maybe
hops
additions
give
this
a
slighly
bitter
edge
to
what
is
an
alchoholic
sweet
style
beer
great
finish
and
great
mouthfeel
make
this
a
champion
beer
for
its
style
kingly
but
subtle
sublime
is
the
word
greatly
enjoyable
and
after
comsuming
three
quarters
of
the
case
this
beer
deserves
its
rep
best
most
complex
pumpkin
beer
that
i
have
drunk
so
far
so
says
the
great
pumpkin
lover
d
i
dig
graham
crackers
but
im
buying
different
southern
tier
beer
drinkability
i
am
pleased
with
this
beer
its
solid
and
delivers
what
i
came
for
pumpkin
there
is
a
reason
why
this
is
the
king
it
will
forever
be
a
memory
to
me
southern
tier
pumking
is
a
beer
i
have
really
been
looking
forward
to
so
i
saved
it
for
thanksgiving
to
have
with
family
we
all
enjoyed
this
and
liked
the
comparison
to
my
own
pumpkin
beer
a
roasted
pumpkin
and
lightly
spiced
brown
ale
pumking
was
a
vibrant
orange
with
a
fiercely
spicey
nose
it
smelled
like
cloves
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
ginger
spice
and
off
freshly
roasted
sweet
pumpkin
the
beer
tasted
like
a
caramelly
sweet
piece
of
ginger
bread
with
a
lot
of
spice
maybe
too
much
and
there
was
a
little
butterscotch
which
might
be
a
flaw
normally
went
well
in
this
beer
the
only
fault
that
i
can
find
in
this
beer
is
the
over
utliization
of
spices
which
infiltrates
every
square
milimeter
of
my
mouth
and
lingers
on
there
is
no
delicacy
or
deftness
in
the
spicing
just
a
wallop
on
the
head
which
negatively
affects
its
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
and
would
argue
that
it
is
consistently
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
brewed
each
year
i
cant
wait
for
next
years
batch
to
see
if
they
develop
it
even
further
thanks
southern
tier
drinkability
is
relatively
high
the
abv
is
moderately
high
but
well
incorporated
the
flavor
profile
is
also
nice
however
it
seems
it
will
be
a
bit
of
a
task
to
repeat
this
taste
for
an
entire
bomber
overall
not
bad
a
great
choice
for
a
thanksgiving
day
beer
but
might
be
a
once
a
year
beer
for
me
overall
truly
great
stuff
best
pumpkin
ale
maybe
not
as
drinkable
as
milder
ones
but
that
flavor
is
unmatched
overall
an
excellent
pumpkin
beer
i
prefer
this
to
the
others
i
have
sampled
d
everything
about
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
fresh
baked
pumpkin
pie
the
label
suggests
its
a
halloween
beer
but
i
think
it
works
best
as
a
desert
beer
for
thanksgiving
dinner
this
is
a
tasty
beer
although
it
is
almost
a
dessert
rather
than
a
beer
definitely
worthy
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
overall
all
i
can
say
is
good
job
mouthfeel
is
fine
drinkability
poor
this
marks
my
second
pumpkin
ale
with
the
first
being
brooklyns
post
road
and
for
the
most
part
i
was
very
impressed
it
looks
great
and
the
nose
is
near
perfect
but
the
alcohol
could
really
use
some
toning
down
i
think
that
would
allow
for
all
of
the
sweet
and
spicy
notes
to
really
shine
and
increase
its
drinkability
many
times
over
with
its
hefty
price
tag
i
think
ill
stick
to
brooklyns
pumpkin
ale
for
when
i
have
the
urge
to
drink
a
spicy
pumpkin
beer
but
id
say
this
one
is
still
worth
a
try
this
beer
needs
to
be
cleaned
up
a
little
bit
the
ethyl
is
too
easily
detectable
in
here
anyhow
feel
wise
its
warming
a
little
crisp
and
oily
at
the
same
time
overall
this
was
my
first
pumpkin
beer
and
i
chose
to
try
one
of
the
best
to
represent
the
style
well
although
i
did
manage
to
try
and
like
this
style
the
flavor
in
this
beer
was
just
way
too
muchand
not
in
a
good
way
it
would
have
been
better
if
the
nutty
flavor
in
this
beer
was
not
overdrive
d
meh
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
the
standout
that
ive
read
about
ive
definitely
had
better
but
on
the
same
not
ive
had
much
worse
d
if
it
wasnt
for
the
high
levels
of
alcohol
i
could
enjoy
this
one
over
and
over
in
one
sitting
deep
golden
orange
in
colour
with
abundant
eggshell
foam
that
laces
patchily
intense
aroma
of
pumpkin
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
pie
crust
sweet
and
malty
bursting
with
pumpkin
flavour
as
well
as
vanilla
cookie
dough
and
an
earthy
bitterness
in
the
finish
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
medium
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
that
makes
it
feel
soft
and
fluffy
in
the
mouth
i
like
pumpkin
beer
but
only
in
small
doses
a
6er
of
dfh
punk
for
example
took
a
few
months
for
me
to
finish
last
year
considering
this
is
like
pumpkin
beer
on
steroids
this
was
shockingly
easy
to
drink
i
was
worried
i
would
fatigue
on
it
part
way
through
but
there
was
no
such
problem
i
dont
think
ill
be
rushing
out
to
buy
more
but
i
could
see
this
being
a
nice
treat
once
every
autumn
d
the
taste
is
complex
interesting
but
not
sure
if
im
on
board
would
rather
have
a
weyerbacher
or
dfh
pumpkin
basically
this
is
like
liquid
pumpkin
pie
with
a
kick
and
this
could
be
a
great
pumpkin
ale
if
they
put
a
leash
on
the
spices
and
cleaned
up
the
finish
final
thoughts
well
after
two
lackluster
brews
southern
tier
continues
to
disappoint
me
its
a
shame
too
as
it
started
out
so
nicely
now
one
thing
i
did
notice
is
this
one
seems
to
be
7
9
so
maybe
i
got
last
years
batch
i
doubt
it
but
i
wouldnt
put
it
past
the
lcbo
either
way
this
one
is
a
pass
the
so
called
best
pumpkin
ale
i
did
not
find
to
be
even
remotely
nice
once
it
touched
my
lips
one
more
strike
and
southern
tier
strikes
out
for
me
southern
tier
is
my
hometown
brewery
and
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
this
from
a
trade
with
an
old
friend
nice
clear
orange
pour
with
a
pretty
quickly
fading
head
and
decent
lacing
the
huge
smell
is
totally
incredible
when
you
consider
its
beer
ive
had
plenty
of
pumpkin
beers
but
none
of
them
smelled
like
this
sugary
spicey
with
tons
of
caramel
and
the
fresh
pumpkin
pie
aroma
is
awesome
the
taste
is
much
the
same
as
the
smell
big
and
complex
lots
of
cinnamon
brown
sugar
nutmeg
and
the
most
authentic
pumpkin
pie
flavor
ever
in
a
pumpkin
beer
and
the
best
thing
is
that
southern
tier
does
all
this
without
making
it
sickly
sweet
like
most
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
very
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
its
sweet
but
the
bitter
hop
bite
offsets
that
and
reminds
you
that
its
beer
i
had
totally
forgotten
that
this
was
a
9
imperial
until
i
reviewed
it
southern
tier
is
arguably
the
best
at
disguising
high
alcohol
beers
drinkability
is
huge
when
you
consider
this
is
more
of
a
dessert
beer
and
an
imperial
i
would
love
to
reduce
this
and
pour
it
over
vanilla
ice
cream
but
ive
only
got
4
and
im
drinking
them
all
another
top
notch
beer
from
soutern
tier
thanks
for
making
this
possible
torry
overall
a
great
unique
pumpkin
beer
like
all
of
their
imperials
southern
tier
aimed
high
with
this
one
the
result
is
fantastic
but
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
a
few
of
these
a
year
but
ill
always
look
forward
to
breaking
open
a
bottle
of
this
one
as
long
as
i
dont
have
to
finish
it
myself
this
is
easily
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
although
at
the
same
time
its
sweetness
makes
it
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
though
i
tend
to
have
a
similar
issue
with
other
pumpkin
beers
what
i
had
was
a
gorgeous
heady
brew
with
a
caramel
to
amber
color
and
thick
white
head
it
smelled
like
the
day
after
halloween
when
all
the
frat
boys
have
smashed
pumpkins
all
over
the
street
and
theres
a
crisp
chilly
autumnal
flavor
to
the
air
the
flavor
was
rich
and
delicious
with
plenty
of
pumpkin
and
a
hint
of
spice
not
like
the
pumpkin
pieinaglass
style
that
afflicts
so
many
of
these
beers
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
with
any
luck
it
will
be
sans
hippie
dingbat
d
pumking
is
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
but
its
still
nice
and
enjoyable
this
would
be
great
with
something
sweet
ive
seen
them
on
tap
and
in
22
oz
bombers
the
22
oz
is
a
bit
much
to
drink
by
yourself
share
with
someone
you
care
about
had
it
on
draft
at
sheffields
in
chicago
this
past
weekend
anytime
that
you
can
get
a
pumpking
a
founders
breakfast
stout
and
a
smuttynose
ipa
all
on
draft
at
one
sitting
you
know
youre
at
a
decent
bar
in
any
event
this
is
hands
down
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
tried
i
think
i
spent
more
time
with
my
snout
hovering
over
the
tulip
glass
than
i
spent
actually
drinking
it
the
aroma
is
perfect
with
great
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
clove
notes
smells
and
to
a
large
extent
tastes
just
like
a
pumpkin
pie
could
have
used
a
little
more
head
could
have
been
a
bad
pour
and
the
head
could
have
been
a
little
creamier
aside
from
that
delicious
rarely
do
i
feel
that
i
can
drink
two
fruit
beers
backtoback
but
i
certainly
could
have
done
so
with
the
pumpking
that
is
if
i
didnt
have
a
breakfast
stout
on
deck
southern
tier
pumking
is
simply
the
best
pumpkin
ale
on
the
market
there
is
nothing
close
i
tasted
this
beer
out
of
the
bottle
and
on
tap
and
both
were
excellent
i
work
at
a
pub
and
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
many
examples
of
pumpkin
ales
again
this
is
the
best
pumking
smells
amazing
and
follows
with
an
equivalent
taste
highly
recommended
happily
encountered
at
the
grill
next
door
in
haverhill
ma
this
seasonal
offering
is
a
very
clear
light
yellowishamber
color
with
a
modest
white
head
and
marginal
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
deep
herbal
pumpkin
with
cinnamon
malt
and
toasted
sweet
potatoe
marshmallow
sweetness
awesome
and
so
tempting
the
taste
offers
similar
tasty
ideas
with
allspice
graham
cracker
and
squashpumpkin
malted
together
for
a
desertlike
medley
deliciously
unveiled
in
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
modest
carbonation
that
gives
a
mellow
mouthfeel
with
fair
drinkability
at
best
this
is
sweet
and
autumnally
tasty
stuff
that
is
probably
best
enjoyed
one
glassful
at
a
seating
alcohol
is
not
highly
evident
but
notable
id
sworn
off
southern
tiers
sweet
beers
but
caved
in
and
decided
to
give
this
a
try
glad
i
did
not
my
favourite
pumpkin
beer
but
not
the
worst
either
side
note
this
is
my
girls
favorite
brew
apparently
this
year
is
a
bit
worse
than
previous
years
so
im
hoping
i
can
try
a
vintage
version
of
this
there
is
a
lasting
aftertaste
of
hops
alcohol
and
pumpkin
this
is
a
medium
bodied
offering
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
i
feel
the
boldness
of
the
alcohol
hurts
this
brew
a
bit
and
takes
away
from
its
drinkability
the
nose
was
fantastic
but
the
unbalanced
hop
and
alcohol
character
was
a
distraction
with
the
pumpkin
taking
a
far
back
seat
for
being
considered
the
pumpkin
beer
that
all
other
pumpkin
beers
are
measured
up
against
this
one
fell
short
pours
a
copper
color
with
an
orange
tinge
that
already
suggests
pumpkin
big
but
shortlived
head
slightly
offwhite
the
aroma
is
massively
pumpkiny
the
aroma
is
spicy
as
well
the
pumpkin
and
additional
spices
blending
with
spicy
hops
the
taste
follows
suit
im
going
to
go
ahead
and
declare
this
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
this
year
pumpkin
meat
not
spice
dominates
this
beer
theres
that
great
vegetable
sweetness
and
if
im
not
mistaken
theres
some
caramel
as
well
unlike
many
pumpkin
beers
the
spice
here
takes
much
more
of
a
supporting
role
rounding
out
the
sweetness
and
serving
as
an
effective
substitute
for
bitter
hops
to
clean
up
the
finish
sweetness
does
linger
a
bit
but
believe
me
thats
a
good
thing
it
stays
very
drinkable
throughout
with
no
hint
of
the
rather
hefty
alcohol
content
i
regret
waiting
until
so
late
in
the
season
to
try
this
one
it
really
exemplifies
what
a
pumpkin
beer
should
be
taste
has
that
unique
flavor
of
real
pumpkin
melded
with
caramel
malt
the
spicing
is
a
bit
lacking
though
and
pumpkin
isnt
the
most
delicious
of
ingredients
without
a
decent
amount
of
spice
to
compensate
the
strength
is
well
hidden
and
youd
never
know
it
was
9
crisp
carbonation
drinkability
dessert
beer
split
this
bomber
with
a
friend
this
is
probably
my
favorite
fall
beer
it
combines
all
the
great
flavors
of
fall
with
a
smooth
sweet
spicy
finish
wow
perhaps
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
2009
so
a
year
has
treated
it
quite
well
thanks
liamt07
for
sending
this
gem
my
way
this
is
a
little
extreem
for
a
pumpkin
beer
but
is
worth
a
try
king
of
the
style
not
to
be
taken
lightly
drink
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
that
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
youve
come
to
the
right
place
there
is
a
reason
this
beer
is
referred
to
as
the
king
im
not
sure
the
bottle
needs
to
be
650ml
youd
be
well
advised
to
find
some
friends
to
share
this
one
with
a
little
goes
a
looong
way
its
a
once
a
year
type
beer
that
im
happy
i
tried
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
because
the
sweet
flavors
in
the
taste
arent
cloying
because
of
the
underlying
hops
and
the
alcohol
content
is
very
well
masked
overall
hands
down
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
this
isnt
something
id
drink
more
than
a
bomber
of
in
a
night
but
it
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
halloween
very
filling
and
quite
buzz
inducing
im
happy
to
have
had
the
opportunity
of
tasting
this
unique
beer
drinkability
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
to
date
possibly
the
first
ive
really
enjoyed
my
only
quips
is
that
the
sweetness
needs
to
be
dialed
back
ive
heard
that
this
years
batch
has
been
especially
sweet
and
the
mouthfeel
could
stand
to
be
fuller
aside
from
this
the
spicing
is
on
point
and
pumpkin
flavor
is
in
the
forefront
theres
a
reason
this
beer
has
been
singled
out
as
one
of
the
toprated
pumpkin
beers
a
musttry
making
sure
to
save
some
for
halloween
and
thanksgiving
brooklyn
post
road
may
be
the
best
allaround
as
far
as
looktastefeel
and
smuttynose
may
have
the
best
pumpkin
flavor
but
pumking
sports
the
most
mouthwatering
aroma
and
overall
drinkability
i
still
dont
have
a
crystalclear
view
on
what
a
pumpkin
ale
should
or
could
be
but
this
sets
some
kind
of
standard
cheers
pumpkin
beers
arent
really
my
thing
but
this
is
a
decent
one
to
drink
still
though
im
okay
with
this
once
a
year
or
so
moreys
bottom
line
a
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
southern
tier
knows
how
to
hide
the
alcohol
in
their
big
beers
well
done
and
highly
recommended
this
would
be
a
great
one
to
bring
to
a
halloween
party
simply
because
the
bottle
looks
kick
ass
and
would
inspire
some
conversation
and
tasting
i
remain
a
huge
fan
of
southern
tier
but
this
is
a
beer
id
be
hesitant
to
purchase
again
happy
halloween
note
to
self
ranked
6
pumpkin
ale
when
i
tried
it
i
can
best
sum
this
up
as
a
novelty
beer
i
have
a
lovehate
relationship
with
it
in
a
way
its
worth
trying
at
least
once
because
its
just
so
damn
wacky
probably
worth
it
just
to
smell
it
i
myself
will
probably
get
this
at
least
once
a
year
during
the
season
at
9
alcohol
a
single
22
oz
bottle
makes
a
real
nice
fall
nightcap
ive
been
impressed
with
southern
tiers
quality
the
old
man
winter
i
tried
earlier
this
week
is
also
very
nice
taste
is
a
lot
like
pumpkin
pie
on
the
finish
its
a
bit
overwhelming
and
its
gonna
be
hard
to
finish
this
all
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
though
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
but
has
a
crisp
carbonation
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
nice
and
crisp
a
little
on
the
boozy
side
but
im
almost
sorry
i
am
sharing
my
bomber
very
drinkable
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
im
not
always
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
just
one
or
two
every
fall
is
enough
for
me
but
i
could
certainly
drink
a
couple
bottles
of
pumking
it
works
very
well
as
a
shared
beverage
im
splitting
this
bottle
and
that
is
perfect
for
me
when
i
finish
ill
be
satisfied
but
excited
to
try
it
again
got
to
try
this
again
a
year
later
and
this
beer
has
really
grown
on
me
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
to
date
love
the
cinnamon
pumpkin
and
spices
flavours
through
out
so
easy
to
drink
for
the
high
percentage
too
glad
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
i
dont
typically
prefer
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
is
suprisingly
drinkable
and
unique
splitting
a
22oz
was
easy
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
ever
had
certainly
one
of
my
new
favorites
this
is
my
second
tasting
and
it
only
gets
worse
my
apologies
to
those
who
liked
it
i
give
southern
tier
credit
for
listing
ingredients
very
good
for
educating
us
drinkers
i
mean
consumers
the
aroma
is
strongly
pumpkin
pie
with
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
and
the
bready
crust
finishing
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
its
really
amazing
the
flavor
is
much
milder
than
the
aroma
the
pumpkin
and
spices
are
still
there
accompanied
by
orange
and
anise
the
alcohol
doesnt
show
itself
in
the
flavor
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
better
than
any
other
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
another
drain
pour
for
me
bitterly
disappointed
here
waited
to
try
this
for
years
wont
be
a
second
one
if
this
is
what
i
can
expect
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
probably
the
most
intense
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
tried
unfortunately
the
spices
arent
well
balanced
and
it
tastes
too
much
like
egg
nog
not
something
i
would
go
out
and
buy
again
considering
the
price
but
definitely
worth
a
try
very
good
but
a
little
disappointed
from
all
the
talk
about
it
still
would
order
it
again
but
1
or
2
is
enough
overall
i
would
rake
leaves
for
a
couple
hours
to
earn
a
couple
of
these
the
execution
by
southern
tier
is
ever
so
fitting
to
the
theme
win
cheers
m
really
smooth
in
the
mouth
despite
the
9abv
i
liked
the
full
body
and
moderate
carbonation
it
went
down
too
easily
drinkability
was
excellent
as
well
im
gonna
buy
a
few
more
before
they
sell
out
d
for
all
the
accolades
pumking
receives
its
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
tried
this
year
its
in
the
top
tier
for
sure
but
ive
had
several
better
edit
after
having
this
a
few
more
times
as
well
as
several
other
pumpkin
beers
the
aroma
and
taste
dont
get
much
better
than
this
its
like
liquid
pumpkin
pie
with
a
dollop
of
whipped
cream
on
it
i
didnt
see
myself
buying
this
again
what
the
h
was
i
thinking
ive
bought
it
several
times
since
dn
although
this
beer
has
big
character
and
is
far
from
what
people
would
think
as
a
traditional
beer
pumking
wins
by
successfully
balancing
bold
seemingly
contradictory
flavors
with
lots
of
alcohol
unlike
other
desert
beers
this
one
actually
gets
easier
to
drink

the

smells
very

over
spiced
for

and
ends
with
a
kind
of

sensation
in

as
you
get
further
into
the
22

its
more
a

then
a
serious
beer
one
was
more
than
enough
definitely
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
pumpkin
ales
out
there
d
an
interesting
beer
but
too
spiced
up
for
me
the
cloves
really
dominated
the
palate
and
even
overshadowed
the
pumpkin
flavour
at
times
i
find
this
much
easier
to
drink
and
less
sweet
than
some
of
the
others
in
the
blackwater
series
but
this
is
still
a
beer
to
share
that
being
said
the
alcohol
is
quite
well
hidden
like
with
many
folks
i
cant
justify
i
high
score
for
drinkability
because
23
of
a
pint
is
more
than
enough
sharing
was
a
smart
idea
the
flavor
is
so
potent
so
hearty
that
more
than
a
pint
or
two
a
season
would
be
simply
too
much
southern
tier
need
not
worry
about
this
pumpkin
ales
are
a
seasonal
treat
that
many
of
us
look
forward
to
but
only
so
few
can
drink
in
vast
quantities
fortunately
their
pumpking
can
rightfully
claim
to
be
among
the
best
of
the
patch
so
when
i
want
my
pumpkin
ale
fix
theirs
will
be
almost
certainly
be
the
one
i
call
upon
to
sum
up
great
for
what
it
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
of
2010
but
make
sure
you
have
a
friend
to
split
the
bomber
with
without
a
doubt
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
very
well
crafted
simply
delicious

d
not
really
there
this
is
a
heavy
handed
beer
that
beats
you
over
the
head
to
let
you
know
it
is
a
pumpkin
beer
i
liked
this
much
more
than
the
st
ambroise
pumpkin
but
not
as
much
as
the
great
lakes
grand
river
or
taps
brewing
pumpkins
d
much
better
than
the
two
other
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
from
dfh
and
some
other
horrible
one
great
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
every
few
days
thanks
again
michael
for
the
great
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
on
the
heavyish
side
of
medium
drinkability
especially
given
the
high
abv
is
the
really
spooky
part
of
this
beer
jake
d
very
interesting
take
i
really
enjoy
it
and
its
probably
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
this
season
m
d
mouthfeel
is
a
little
cream
but
not
too
thick
drinkability
is
great
the
bomber
is
a
perfect
amount
i
could
drink
one
a
week
oct
nov
not
gonna
lie
here
drainpoured
half
the
bottle
im
no
pumpkin
beer
conniousseur
but
ive
had
my
fair
share
and
this
was
by
far
the
most
unpleasant
really
not
understanding
all
the
positive
reviews
not
was
i
was
expecting
i
doubt
ill
have
another
future
outlook
a
solid
beer
worthy
of
giving
another
shot
next
time
around
the
number
one
rated
pumpkin
beer
according
to
ba
is
poused
into
a
goblet
for
my
sensory
appreciation
a
light
orange
colour
fills
the
glass
and
is
topped
with
a
khaki
coloured
head
atop
smells
like
a
pumpkin
pie
but
theres
something
else
here
that
i
dont
usually
detect
with
pumpkin
beers
the
usual
suspects
are
there
with
the
pumpkin
cinnamon
cloves
nutmeg
coriander
etc
but
theres
another
presence
i
cant
place
my
finger
on
but
it
puts
it
above
and
beyond
any
others
ive
had
of
this
style
the
taste
is
simply
sublime
with
that
mystery
flavour
coming
into
play
even
more
so
in
the
taste
and
the
9
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
though
not
overwhelmingly
so
and
the
drinkability
is
superb
a
sure
classic
for
the
fall
season
d
no
we
had
this
side
by
side
with
an
actual
good
pumpkin
ale
from
kern
river
the
difference
was
like
night
and
day
this
tastes
like
some
cheap
awful
alcoholic
candy
drinking
beer
from
southern
tiers
diabeetus
imprint
feels
like
a
battle
and
this
is
another
victory
for
them
and
no
other
none
have
come
close
to
pumpkin
pie
as
this
beer
has
i
have
heard
good
things
about
southern
tier
brewery
pumking
cool
name
pours
a
bright
translucent
orange
color
with
a
quick
fizzing
white
head
and
some
fine
lacing
on
the
glass
enjoyed
this
one
at
the
optimal
temperature
suggested
on
the
bottle
40
degrees
and
in
my
prized
duvel
goblet
for
the
optimal
experience
smell
was
very
autumn
inspiring
with
a
mixture
of
ginger
snaps
and
eggnog
yeilding
a
big
complex
nose
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
that
ginger
snap
foward
taste
and
a
bitter
finish
from
the
hops
on
the
sides
of
the
tonuge
i
do
not
detect
much
pumpkin
because
most
of
it
is
masked
by
the
spices
and
hop
bitterness
but
it
is
rather
tame
and
semidrinkable
despite
the
high
9
abv
not
a
bad
imperial
pours
a
pretty
clear
pumpkin
orange
color
with
a
healthy
12
finger
white
head
leaves
a
lot
of
abstract
lacing
along
the
glass
aroma
very
strong
biscuits
or
pie
crust
taste
is
like
a
sweet
biscuit
with
pumpkin
flavors
and
nutmeg
type
spices
mixed
in
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thick
and
syrupy
not
very
carbonated
would
recommend
this
as
a
desert
beer
to
compliment
some
carrot
cake
or
spice
cake
or
pumpkin
pie

not
too
much
done
quite
nicely
the
smell
is
definitely
better
than
the
taste
in
my
opinion
nice
mouthfeel
not
too
thick
very
drinkable
for
9
but
id
probably
only
drink
1
in
a
sitting
so
to
not
get
sick
of
that
pumpkin
flavor
the
taste
is
surprisingly
light
very
true
to
taste
of
pumpkins
not
overly
spices
like
some
variety
this
one
comes
the
closest
to
pumpkin
pie
delicious
sip
yields
the
pumpkin
taste
and
slight
spices
which
soon
fades
into
a
lingering
yeast
aftertase
light
and
foamy
mouthfeel
just
picked
this
guy
up
off
the
shelves
should
have
let
it
cool
a
bit
more
but
overall
this
is
a
high
note
for
the
falloctober
beer
releases
drinkability
is
high
but
one
bomber
is
plenty
d
a
bomber
is
probably
pushing
it
with
this
one
the
spices
really
give
you
that
heat
burn
feeling
in
the
chest
that
another
sip
helps
to
tone
down
its
a
bit
hot
but
i
think
if
you
can
grab
one
to
cellar
it
will
be
great
for
next
year
holy
alcohol
batman
this
is
my
second
or
thrid
year
in
a
row
getting
the
king
ive
been
on
a
quest
for
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
and
this
has
fallen
down
considerably
really
bitey
from
the
alcohol
really
really
almondesque
and
the
nutty
characters
werent
accentuated
by
any
spices
overall
this
is
not
very
drinkable
unless
its
time
to
get
pumpkin
drunk
the
carbonation
and
appearance
were
both
fine
i
love
southern
tier
i
love
most
of
their
offerings
and
i
love
pumpkin
beers
but
this
beer
is
flat
out
awful
the
taste
has
a
strong
and
lingering
hop
character
and
the
malt
taste
is
also
very
present
although
there
is
certainly
the
sense
that
one
is
biting
into
a
delicious
piece
of
pie
pastry
filling
and
all
the
texture
of
this
beer
is
light
caramellike
and
creamy
generally
a
delicious
brew
though
perhaps
i
wouldnt
want
it
all
year
long
pours
a
bright
orange
colour
with
thick
head
and
nice
rings
of
lacing
smells
of
lots
of
pumpkin
with
some
hops
and
caramel
flavour
has
a
nice
bitterness
to
it
with
some
of
the
syrupy
sweetness
i
expect
from
some
of
the
southern
tier
beers
though
it
works
much
better
in
this
one
than
in
some
of
their
iipas
thick
syurpy
mouthfeel
quite
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
different
than
many
others
that
ive
had
in
that
is
less
on
spice
and
bigger
on
the
pumpkin
update
thanks
ktrillionaire
the
commonality
between
this
and
choklat
is
a
syrupy
taste
the
most
pumpkiny
pumpkin
beer
out
there
as
it
was
poured
in
a
chalice
the
color
is
a
light
orange
color
a
little
cloudy
almos
no
head
the
smell
is
just
like
a
sweet
pumpin
pie
nutmeg
pumpkin
and
sugar
this
beer
is
too
sweet
for
my
taste
to
have
more
than
one
ever
once
in
a
while
but
i
did
enjoy
every
drop
drinkabilityyes
yes
yes
i
would
definetly
drink
again
the
longer
it
sat
the
better
the
flavor
got
southern
tier
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
d
this
is
phenomenally
delicious
as
a
desert
beer
but
the
confectionery
flavors
are
so
rich
and
saturating
in
nature
that
i
can
not
tolerate
a
second
glass
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
around
handsdown
alcohol
content
is
a
bit
high
and
creeps
up
but
for
the
wonderful
unique
mix
of
aroma
and
flavor
in
this
one
nothing
can
deny
this
king
his
throne
pours
a
very
light
gold
2
fingers
of
head
smells
like
grahm
crackers
pumpkin
mostly
like
pumpkin
pie
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
grahm
crackers
allspice
wow
really
good
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
at
the
end
but
other
than
that
this
is
a
really
good
pumpkin
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
drinkability
is
high
for
this
style
one
of
the
best
price6
99
with
tax
pours
clear
orange
with
a
giant
bubble
head
the
aroma
is
woody
and
cinnamony
and
very
strong
the
flavor
is
absolutely
amazing
it
is
mostly
vanilla
in
fact
shockingly
vanilla
lots
of
cinnamon
allspice
ginger
jesus
is
this
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
or
what
amazing
this
stuff
is
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
tasted
the
only
true
point
lost
on
this
brew
is
in
the
drinkablility
the
high
abv
on
this
brew
might
turn
some
heads
away
however
this
is
surely
my
pick
for
the
pumpkin
ale
of
the
season
theres
a
reason
they
call
it
pumking
this
pumpkin
beer
is
completely
different
than
all
of
the
others
i
have
had
this
may
be
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
easy
to
drink
without
being
too
much
pumpkin
i
really
enjoyed
the
bready
qualtiy
to
this
one
phenomenal
overall
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
ale
not
highly
drinkable
maybe
one
or
two
but
its
not
a
session
beer
highly
recommended
will
have
to
open
my
bottle
of
2010
to
compare
but
imho
the
draft
will
be
tops
really
disappointed
wanted
to
like
this
one
i
really
enjoy
pumpkin
beers
at
this
time
of
year
d
im
set
with
a
bomber
of
this
its
very
filling
a
slow
drinking
beer
served
from
tap
into
a
standard
shaker
poured
a
nice
copper
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
slowly
to
a
minimal
amount
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
pumpkin
pumpkin
spice
brown
sugar
and
granola
the
flavor
was
of
pumpkin
pumpkin
spice
and
pie
crust
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
seriously
like
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
i
dont
know
how
they
pulled
this
off
but
it
is
quite
good
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
to
date
great
for
a
dessert
brew
drinkability
only
loses
a
point
due
to
high
abv
taste
mouthfeel
and
overall
enjoyability
make
this
the
pumpkin
beer
of
choice
for
me
for
this
holiday
halloweensamhain
season
d
i
cant
explain
how
disappointed
i
am
that
i
didnt
like
this
i
waited
forever
to
try
this
and
gotta
say
that
i
wasnt
a
fan
at
all
i
just
couldnt
shake
the
sense
that
i
was
drinking
a
candle
sad
overall
its
a
good
seasonalspecialty
beer
but
i
wouldnt
drink
this
too
often
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
especially
if
you
enjoy
a
good
dose
of
diacetyl
i
typically
dont
and
the
review
numbers
reflect
this
it
is
fairly
drinkable
but
surely
a
novelty
and
not
one
ill
seek
out
again
for
my
tastes
it
reminds
me
too
much
of
the
butter
flavored
sludge
that
movie
theaters
put
on
their
popcorn
d
the
flavor
of
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
that
being
said
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
although
i
might
give
it
another
try
before
its
gone
for
the
year
drinkability
falls
to
the
way
side
with
some
of
the
harsher
flavors
that
i
had
to
push
through
pour
was
a
clear
amber
orange
out
of
the
tap
with
a
fluffy
light
tan
head
not
a
lot
of
retention
smells
just
like
pumpkin
pie
a
real
earthy
sense
to
it
tastes
like
drinking
pumpkin
pie
without
the
hangup
of
crust
and
whipped
cream
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
this
style
but
i
have
to
make
an
exception
here
this
is
really
good
i
really
liked
that
the
sweetness
was
left
out
especially
with
the
highish
abv
i
was
floored
when
the
owner
told
me
it
was
9
you
cant
even
taste
the
alcohol
feels
creamy
and
slightly
sticky
which
really
match
the
flavors
drinkability
is
up
there
dthe
onslaught
of
spice
on
the
palette
is
making
it
hard
to
finish
the
bomber
of
this
one
i
just
keep
tasting
those
spices
over
and
over
again
even
when
taking
breaks
to
critique
the
beer
time
might
this
beers
best
friend
as
the
spice
is
way
too
overwhelming
for
me
d
very
good
pumpkin
beer
and
will
buy
it
again
it
would
be
better
if
was
thicker
and
creamier
with
the
9
abv
hidden
more
really
enjoy
the
pumpkin
pie
flavor
of
the
beer
pumpkin
orange
with
a
creamy
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
amazing
pumpkin
pie
with
vanilla
cream
not
much
in
the
way
of
trad
malt
or
hop
notes
in
the
nose
the
flavors
in
this
brew
far
exceed
that
of
the
average
pumpkin
spice
brew
its
like
pumpkin
pie
custard
with
vanilla
whipped
cream
medium
bodied
with
smooth
and
steady
carbonation
good
drinkability
for
being
9
alcohol
but
i
probably
would
not
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
beer
poured
a
clear
pumpkin
light
amber
colored
brew
in
my
duvel
tulip
glass
it
smells
strongly
of
pumpkin
pie
just
like
a
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
also
just
like
a
pumpkin
pie
with
like
9
of
alcohol
poured
into
it
though
very
tasty
it
is
a
bit
overbearing
the
mouth
feel
is
good
and
i
am
still
blown
away
by
the
flavors
though
i
could
drink
more
not
in
the
same
night
great
beer
just
a
little
overwhelming
on
the
flavors
this
is
a
very
unique
imperial
pumpkin
beer
sweeter
more
than
spicy
if
you
like
pumpkin
pie
you
will
like
this
beer
if
you
desire
spice
head
for
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
d
ive
been
waiting
for
a
good
decent
pumpkin
beer
and
this
one
is
the
winner
by
far
the
best
one
ive
had
and
it
had
a
really
good
price
on
it
too
this
one
really
taste
like
pumpkin
d
was
great
but
wasnt
for
me
really
i
will
drink
it
again
if
its
around
but
if
i
had
a
choice
im
going
with
something
lighter
in
closing
is
this
the
ultimate
pumpkin
beer
i
dont
know
about
that
i
think
for
now
that
title
belongs
to
elysian
night
owl
this
is
certainly
a
good
brew
and
a
fine
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
seasonal
styles
mouthfeel
it
is
like
eating
pumkin
pie
if
you
ate
the
crust
end
first
i
like
this
more
then
most
beers
of
this
style
i
could
have
one
however
and
be
content
the
same
with
thanksgiving
the
pumpkin
pie
is
the
ending
im
stuffed
after
this
one
drinkability
awesome
every
time
i
take
a
sip
i
just
want
more
one
of
the
most
flavorful
pumpkin
ales
ive
ever
tasted
could
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
just
make
sure
someone
takes
my
keys
enjoy
this
fine
brew
if
you
are
looking
for
pumpkin
pie
taste
this
is
your
beer
had
a
case
of
bombers
and
it
is
really
hard
to
keep
your
hands
off
of
this
beer
just
awesome
notes
this
could
be
a
great
beer
if
they
thickened
up
the
body
it
is
imperial
after
all
as
mentioned
the
hop
bitterness
was
also
out
of
place
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
creme
brulee
stout
but
i
feel
that
if
southern
tier
took
a
page
out
of
that
book
and
went
balls
to
the
wall
here
and
made
this
strictly
a
sweet
dessert
beer
it
would
be
much
better
it
feels
as
though
they
have
diluted
it
and
restrained
the
sweetness
in
an
effort
to
keep
it
more
on
the
beery
side
i
cant
praise
the
nose
enough
but
after
that
i
think
this
beer
was
average
in
almost
every
other
way
a
few
tweaks
in
the
recipe
would
make
all
the
difference
overall
i
have
a
had
a
few
pumpkin
beers
in
my
time
and
this
is
the
strongest
one
i
have
had
the
aroma
is
fantastic
however
the
spice
lingers
on
the
finish
too
long
and
reduces
the
balance
of
the
beer
adding
a
bitterness
it
is
still
a
great
fall
seasonal
release
however
be
aware
that
is
has
a
lot
of
flavor
the
perfect
autumnal
warmer
treat
yourself
to
a
pint
over
thanksgiving
dinner
or
while
masterfully
carving
pumpkins
on
all
hallows
eve
booya
overall
not
impressed
given
the
hype
everyone
lauds
over
this
if
it
tasted
like
pumpkin
instead
of
popcorn
i
wouldve
liked
it
better
dfh
punkin
weyerbacher
imp
pumpkin
and
terrapin
pumpkinfest
blow
this
beer
out
of
the
water
d
its
very
flavorful
and
easily
drinkable
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
southern
tier
really
likes
using
their
hops
and
it
shows
with
the
number
of
imperial
selections
they
have
but
in
this
case
it
counts
against
them
a
lot
of
brewers
in
north
america
have
been
putting
most
of
their
focus
on
hops
lately
often
hopping
beers
out
of
thier
style
and
i
feel
this
is
what
happend
here
the
pumpkin
was
too
short
lived
before
it
was
shoved
aside
and
overwhelmed
by
the
hops
which
took
center
stage
leaving
just
the
spice
in
the
end
this
doesnt
mean
i
hated
it
id
drink
it
again
happily
if
someone
offered
it
but
in
my
opinion
a
pumpkin
ale
just
isnt
right
for
a
big
hop
and
alcohol
content
to
be
the
center
of
attention
not
much
pumpkin
to
it
and
a
jumbled
mess
of
other
flavors
it
left
an
astringency
on
the
back
of
my
throat
that
i
couldnt
shake
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
overrated
beers
ever
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
heavy
almost
chewy
except
for
the
empty
end
of
the
taste
carbonation
level
is
good
the
drinkability
is
low
though
ive
had
many
of
the
other
st
dessert
beers
and
can
appreceate
that
style
but
this
example
just
falls
flat
god
thing
my
wife
loves
it
because
i
had
hard
enough
time
finishing
my
half
of
a
bomber
pumking
may
be
my
new
favorite
imperial
style
pumpkin
beer
thought
there
are
several
in
the
style
i
need
to
try
yet
until
i
do
however
this
beats
the
rest
in
quality
and
intensity
of
flavor
though
i
have
to
remark
the
vanilla
borders
on
feeling
artificial
artificial
or
not
the
flavor
is
well
integrated
with
an
authentic
pumpkin
flavor
independent
of
the
traditional
pumpkin
spices
which
are
easily
overdone
in
other
pumpkin
ales
very
good
and
highly
recommended
though
perhaps
not
to
everyones
taste
as
demonstrated
by
my
wife
who
did
not
enjoy
this
in
the
least
i
had
this
at
a
great
restaurant
in
cleveland
called
melt
i
really
need
to
find
it
here
in
nc
st
brews
tend
to
be
very
potent
versions
of
the
style
some
like
this
more
than
others
in
this
case
i
think
they
do
an
incredible
job
of
following
the
style
making
a
high
abv
very
drinkable
and
making
a
beer
that
stands
out
glad
i
tried
this
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
but
stronger
and
more
artificial
tastes
like
corn
syrup
and
pumpkin
pie
flavored
sugar
water
god
this
is
bad
if
i
wasnt
at
an
outdoor
tasting
festival
it
would
have
been
a
drain
pour
i
struggled
to
get
the
5
oz
sampler
down
i
wanted
to
like
this
so
badly
i
wanted
to
fall
in
love
with
a
fall
beer
that
was
reminiscent
of
the
smells
and
flavors
of
the
season
this
sucker
is
reminiscent
of
autumn
only
if
fall
was
fabricated
by
hallmark
nothing
natural
about
it
it
should
come
with
silver
glitter
floating
inside
to
complete
the
effect
poured
about
6
bucks
of
beer
down
the
drain
after
sharing
with
three
other
people
d
this
is
just
terrible
a
waste
of
7
if
you
really
want
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
stick
with
cottonwood
it
is
by
far
the
best
one
out
there
d
all
good
review
save
the
drinkability
i
suppose
that
i
may
have
a
slightly
skewed
perspective
but
i
couldnt
honestly
even
finish
the
bottle
is
was
so
rich
this
is
what
i
have
been
waiting
for
if
youre
looking
for
a
pumpkin
beer
that
isnt
watered
down
spice
and
actually
tastes
like
pumpkin
seek
this
out
and
dont
turn
back
this
is
what
a
pumpkin
beer
should
taste
like
between
this
and
their
creme
brulee
southern
tier
is
a
personal
favorite
brewer
love
it
d
yup
thats
it
right
there
nearly
perfect
overall
impression
not
something
ill
revisit
im
beginning
to
wonder
if
a
pumpkin
beer
focusing
on
the
pumpkin
actually
exists
price
at
witherspoon
wines
d
probably
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
tried
so
far
exceptionally
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
for
a
9
but
awfully
bitter
for
a
pumpkinspice
ale
glad
i
tried
it
not
sure
id
order
a
2nd
i
had
high
expectations
going
into
this
one
and
they
were
met
a
very
unique
pumpkin
brew
with
very
nice
balance
in
flavors
i
might
have
to
stock
up
on
some
more
before
theyre
all
gone
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
but
its
something
i
can
really
only
have
once
a
year
really
good
its
a
close
call
between
this
and
the
dog
fish
head
i
had
a
southern
tier
pumking
yesterday
after
i
finished
cleaning
the
beer
lines
at
the
lodge
in
hilton
head
and
was
blown
away
by
how
true
to
the
flavor
of
pumpkin
it
was
i
like
other
pumpkin
beers
but
find
that
so
many
are
more
pumpkin
spice
than
anything
this
beer
tasted
like
what
a
pumpkin
smells
like
when
it
is
being
roasted
in
an
oven
it
is
more
honest
to
name
pumpkin
beer
than
others
ive
had
i
would
definitely
drink
this
with
a
thanksgiving
meal
for
a
massive
taste
bud
orgasm
this
is
my
favorite
fall
beer
and
hope
everyone
tries
it
at
least
once
in
their
lives
remember
this
has
an
abv
of
9
the
alcohol
is
not
present
in
the
taste
so
drink
slower
and
savor
the
beer
as
it
should
be
done
regardless
very
unique
beer
even
among
pumpkins
the
aroma
was
super
and
the
taste
very
good
overall
an
excellent
beer
what
a
treat
this
beer
is
in
the
fall
copper
body
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
this
beer
smells
pretty
much
like
pumpkin
pie
in
terms
of
pumpkin
beers
this
one
is
pretty
extreme
for
the
style
literally
liquid
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
big
spicy
pumpkin
pie
flavor
caramel
some
burnt
sugar
notes
not
exactly
a
beer
that
i
can
drink
more
than
a
few
times
per
year
but
definitely
enjoyable
for
the
style
m
very
creamy
and
thick
finish
is
very
wet
but
with
enough
alcohol
to
balance
wait
about
fifteen
seconds
and
it
tapers
off
to
a
medium
taste
like
healthy
portion
and
vitality
of
yeast
culture
very
clean
and
lacking
in
booziness
even
though
it
is
9
the
best
of
the
pumpkin
beers
d
while
the
taste
is
spot
on
for
what
i
think
a
pumpkin
ale
should
be
the
slightly
syrupy
character
makes
this
hard
for
me
to
drink
a
lot
of
im
not
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
but
i
know
a
big
pumpkin
flavor
when
i
taste
it
this
is
spicy
despite
no
use
of
spices
in
the
brew
so
presumably
its
from
the
yeast
or
hops
my
wife
loves
pumpkin
and
is
not
much
of
a
beer
drinker
and
really
liked
this
beer
the
only
thing
i
was
not
too
fond
of
is
its
dry
witbierlike
mouthfeel
it
is
however
a
fine
compliment
to
pumpkin
pie
since
it
is
rather
dry
the
9
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
flavor
and
this
is
just
a
great
big
pumpkin
beer
this
was
the
ride
of
my
life
for
pumpkin
ales
9
abv
and
you
cant
even
taste
the
heat
this
was
my
4th
pumking
this
year
and
i
plan
on
tasting
more
and
more
great
consistency
from
bottle
to
bottle
i
recommend
you
drink
this
one
soon
d
i
always
look
forward
to
this
every
year
now
after
trying
it
for
the
first
time
last
year
in
my
excitement
for
this
years
pumking
and
in
an
effort
to
reduce
the
chances
of
my
local
distributor
running
out
of
pumking
early
like
they
did
last
year
i
purchased
two
cases
i
paid
190
and
all
i
got
was
this
lousy
remembrance
of
a
good
beer
if
you
love
pumpkin
pie
and
simple
wellmade
beer
this
is
perhaps
the
beer
for
you
the
apparent
high
alcohol
hurts
the
experience
though
im
sure
other
less
immediately
apparent
aspects
of
the
abv
help
the
experience
i
am
no
expert
brewer
but
not
enough
to
keep
me
from
enjoying
the
beer
like
southern
tiers
crème
brûlée
this
beer
successfully
straddles
novelty
and
substance
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
drinkability
is
quite
good
overall
pumking
is
an
really
wellcrafted
example
of
the
style
recommended
overallbig
pumpkin
beer
tasty
and
tastes
like
real
pumpkin
at
the
same
time
i
could
have
used
a
bit
more
in
the
aroma
im
not
entirely
sure
what
more
spice
but
it
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
otherwise
i
found
this
to
be
an
extremely
pleasant
sipper
and
absolutely
perfect
for
a
cold
fall
day
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
beer
big
spicy
pumpkin
flavor
with
balanced
sweetness
and
concealed
alcohol
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
to
date
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
in
the
world
but
it
tastes
great
for
the
one
or
two
glasses
i
can
drink
unique
and
definately
worth
a
try
pumpkin
ale
on
steroids
i
am
growing
fonder
and
fonder
of
southern
tier
pours
a
deep
copperorange
with
a
thick
lasting
head
it
took
several
sniffs
before
i
could
come
up
with
the
aroma
it
has
the
spice
but
also
the
smell
of
pumpkin
like
when
i
carve
them
at
halloween
and
the
smell
i
couldnt
figure
out
was
graham
crackers
i
told
my
friends
that
and
they
thought
i
was
nuts
but
i
looked
at
some
other
reviews
and
they
said
the
same
thing
nice
balance
of
pumpkin
and
spice
and
unlike
other
pumpkin
beers
this
really
stays
good
all
the
way
through
to
the
end
i
think
i
like
a
more
spiced
beer
but
this
was
a
top
5
pumpkin
beer
it
poured
very
nicely
to
a
bright
orange
unlike
any
beer
ive
had
before
it
poured
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
slowly
went
away
smell
this
was
the
first
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
so
i
was
completely
shocked
by
how
pumpkin
pielike
it
smelled
it
was
sweet
with
the
accents
of
various
spices
a
real
treat
tastes
excellent
simply
excellent
pumpkin
pie
pumpkins
definitely
some
nutmeg
and
spices
more
in
the
taste
than
the
smell
a
great
background
to
the
beer
also
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
dry
but
light
and
smooth
overall
an
excellent
brew
to
drink
especially
this
time
of
year
it
really
gives
you
the
feel
of
the
fall
i
look
forward
to
getting
more
for
the
holidays
d
this
beer
has
the
most
remarkably
realistic
pumpkin
pie
aroma
i
have
ever
encountered
most
pumpkin
ales
taste
like
bad
spice
soup
while
some
manage
to
become
an
interesting
combination
of
malt
and
spice
but
none
ever
really
smell
like
pie
at
best
they
smell
like
something
that
can
remind
one
of
pumpkin
pie
when
the
idea
is
suggested
beforehand
this
beer
on
the
other
hand
is
really
something
extraordinary
it
truly
smells
like
home
made
pumpkin
pie
right
down
to
the
bready
note
of
pie
crust
this
aroma
is
remarkable
and
quite
pleasant
but
i
am
still
not
sure
it
makes
for
a
good
beer
the
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
mess
with
heavy
toast
and
musty
hops
that
just
dont
make
me
feel
like
i
want
to
finish
the
bomber
sitting
in
front
of
me
in
the
end
i
have
to
regard
this
as
an
interesting
technical
exercise
rather
than
a
normal
beer
the
aroma
is
genuinely
impressive
and
my
hat
is
off
to
the
brewer
for
their
achievement
but
the
beer
just
isnt
all
that
pleasant
to
drink
this
beer
is
a
must
try
but
at
the
same
time
not
one
that
i
would
drink
again
pumpkin
beers
arent
for
everyone
but
pumpking
even
perked
the
interest
of
my
hophead
friend
southern
tier
is
the
jelly
belly
of
brewing
with
their
amazing
flavors
this
pours
with
a
perfect
burnt
orange
tone
as
if
it
were
straight
out
of
the
patch
it
has
a
sugarspice
pumpkin
scent
that
stirs
up
trick
or
treat
nostalgia
and
has
a
taste
to
match
that
emotion
it
finishes
off
with
a
spicy
malt
feeling
on
the
tongue
southern
tier
has
created
a
real
treat
here
that
i
highly
recommended
this
season
all
together
and
southern
tier
has
put
together
a
heavy
weight
pumpkin
ale
that
id
buy
again
without
hesitation
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
and
is
quite
good
very
different
from
a
lot
of
other
ones
in
that
the
spice
is
not
the
main
flavor
component
i
think
i
may
have
to
look
into
getting
another
bomber
of
this
d
this
is
one
of
the
more
interesting
takes
on
a
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
they
didnt
go
for
the
pumpkin
pie
flavor
that
many
breweries
do
by
adding
spices
according
to
the
bottle
its
only
malts
pumpkin
and
hops
the
pumpkin
flavor
on
its
own
is
harder
to
pick
out
than
that
of
the
spices
associated
with
the
pie
overall
though
i
found
this
beer
enjoyable
once
i
got
past
my
expectation
of
pie
flavor
d
like
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
could
have
this
all
night
in
fact
im
writing
this
review
from
notes
i
scribbled
down
and
i
am
craving
this
beer
pours
a
vivid
orange
color
with
nice
12
inch
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
smell
is
filled
with
pumpkin
up
front
in
fact
of
all
the
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
this
has
the
most
up
front
pumpkin
smell
plenty
of
spice
present
as
well
with
some
vanilla
present
as
well
taste
is
in
keeping
with
aroma
more
pumpkin
forward
than
i
was
expecting
in
taste
as
well
has
a
nice
spice
mix
to
balance
the
pumpkin
i
like
the
creaminess
as
well
really
feels
almost
like
a
hint
of
whipped
cream
is
there
alcohol
is
well
masked
considering
the
abv
and
the
beer
goes
down
easy
cant
say
that
i
would
want
the
entire
22oz
beer
myself
but
its
perfect
for
sharing
the
bomber
definitely
going
to
pick
up
some
to
cellar
for
thanksgiving
d
i
would
never
be
able
to
tell
you
that
this
is
9
great
flavors
and
a
nice
balance
make
this
a
pretty
good
beer
i
cant
wait
for
thanksgiving
to
break
one
of
these
out
i
was
very
excited
to
find
this
at
one
of
my
local
stores
so
i
bought
four
of
them
with
a
good
amount
of
anticipation
i
poured
this
and
found
the
appearance
to
be
average
it
is
a
very
light
amber
orange
color
with
a
1
inch
white
foamy
head
the
smell
was
unique
and
not
what
i
expected
i
thought
i
would
get
more
of
that
spicy
cinnamon
pumpkin
seasonal
smell
instead
it
smelled
more
like
fresh
pumpkin
first
taste
was
really
nice
it
tasted
exactly
like
it
smells
and
i
really
enjoyed
that
fresh
pumpkin
flavor
but
after
about
half
a
pint
i
grew
tired
of
the
taste
and
decided
the
pumpkin
was
overwhelming
i
let
it
sit
for
a
while
cleansed
my
palate
and
dove
back
in
again
after
a
few
sips
i
was
tired
of
it
how
am
i
going
to
finish
this
bomber
at
least
it
was
smooth
and
the
carbonation
was
just
right
i
just
poured
the
rest
of
the
bomber
into
my
glass
and
have
half
a
pint
left
im
not
certain
i
will
finish
but
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
pumpking
drinkable
hell
yeah
in
the
same
way
that
warm
pumpkin
pie
is
eatable
one
good
sized
beer
though
and
youre
done
too
sweet
and
desert
like
for
more
than
one
at
a
time
i
saw
some
recent
poor
reviews
of
this
beer
but
ive
had
many
pumpkin
ales
this
year
that
were
reportedly
great
but
which
i
felt
were
passe
if
youre
looking
to
drink
pumpkin
beer
all
day
long
look
elsewhere
but
if
you
want
a
single
unique
pumpkin
beer
give
it
a
shot
forget
the
astmd
really
last
year
was
a
huge
smell
of
pumpkin
pie
great
buttery
sweet
taste
a
real
treat
this
year
ive
drainpoured
it
a
couple
of
times
after
a
couple
of
sips
i
was
so
heartbroken
this
year
i
didnt
want
to
stop
trying
it
after
the
first
couple
of
disasters
but
now
its
been
too
many
and
i
guess
i
have
to
let
go
all
the
magic
is
gone
the
great
pumking
is
just
a
shadow
of
a
memory
bottle
whoa
yippee
a
pumpkin
beer
pours
a
clear
reddish
hued
golden
color
with
a
very
slight
head
strong
smell
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
graham
crackers
its
a
weird
beer
for
sure
for
me
it
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
that
is
not
very
sweet
and
a
few
days
past
its
prime
i
really
dont
understand
the
love
for
this
beer
sweet
malty
upfront
flavor
followed
by
an
odd
pumpkin
spice
kick
at
the
end
that
lingers
far
too
long
medium
mouthfeel
i
dont
know
why
this
beer
is
rated
so
high
i
think
this
is
a
terrible
example
of
pumpkin
ale
shipyard
pumpkin
ale
may
actually
be
better
than
this
drinkability
is
still
limited
to
one
bomber
i
would
like
to
see
a
4
pack
of
7
oz
beers
that
southern
tier
would
release
this
is
meant
to
be
split
autumn
is
my
favorite
season
in
part
because
of
all
things
pumpkin
ale
pie
muffins
pancakes
etc
southern
tiers
pumking
is
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
fall
seasonals
and
probably
tops
in
the
pumpkin
category

t
like
the
nose
pumkings
flavor
has
an
uncanny
resemblance
to
pumpkin
pie
at
9
the
alcohol
is
perceptible
but
generally
very
nicely
masked
there
is
a
sharp
bite
on
the
tail
end
of
the
taste
that
shows
hops
are
in
there

sweet

with
unmistakable
nutmeg

vanilla

a
touch
of
cinnamon

an

dthis
is
such
a
hit
or
miss
style
with
me
mostly
miss
i
have
to
say
that
i
like
this
version
not
heavy
on
the
spices
its
pumpkin
flavor
guys
not
pumpkin
pie
flavor
great
beer
with
thanksgiving
food
if
i
can
get
it
then
s
personally
i
thought
it
was
a
mildly
nutmegclove
spiced
aroma
strong
notes
of
pumpkin
with
a
hint
of
roastedness
up
front
however
in
the
back
the
tase
became
breadier
i
like
the
idea
of
fresh
baked
cookies
but
this
might
be
a
stretch
d
this
is
pretty
good
and
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
to
tide
me
over
for
the
next
few
months
i
hope
to
drink
this
every
autumn
d
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
very
sweet
almost
have
to
drink
it
as
a
desert
not
easy
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
beer
but
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
it
dthis
is
an
excellent
pumpkin
beer
probably
the
best
smelling
one
by
far
the
beer
loses
points
for
the
taste
too
spicy
which
overpowers
a
lot
of
the
taste
my
god
this
beer
is
phenomenal
they
nailed
it
spot
on
with
the
name
it
truly
is
the
king
of
pumpkin
beers
drink
is
very
great
one
of
the
best
fall
beers
i
have
ever
had
if
not
the
best
d
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
pumpkin
beer
king
at
9
this
one
can
get
dangerous
though
overall
what
is
the
point
of
a
9
pumpkin
beer
i
just
couldnt
figure
it
out
its
not
bad
but
it
sure
isnt
something
i
will
go
and
buy
again
just
wasnt
for
me
md
medium
to
full
bodied
carbonation
gives
a
slight
prick
on
tongue
drinkability
is
very
nice
a
more
than
solid
representation
of
the
style
though
the
taste
was
a
slight
light
down
after
the
amazing
aroma
d
drinkable
beer
but
not
the
best
of
its
kind
for
sure
the
pumpkin
flavour
conflicts
with
the
hoppy
bitterness
and
also
some
more
spicy
flavour
cinnamon
nutmeg
etc
would
really
pull
the
pumpkin
out
and
make
the
hops
less
pronounced
for
some
reason
i
remember
last
years
version
quite
different
sweeter
fuller
more
pumpkin
d
doesnt
get
tiring
at
all
for
me
very
possible
others
would
find
the
pumpkin
a
drag
after
awhile
but
i
enjoyed
it
throughout
this
bomber
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
docked
points
there
moderatedly
carbed
the
kind
of
flavorpacked
beer
that
while
barsetting
youre
good
with
the
bomber
for
my
money
hands
down
the
standard
by
which
all
pumpkin
beers
should
be
judged
howd
that
pumpkin
become
king
i
didnt
vote
for
him
the
brew
pours
a
hazy
orange
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
is
a
panoply
of
brewing
and
baking
scents
cinnamon
brown
sugar
clove
pumpkin
pie
filling
nutmeg
pumpkin
seeds
and
golden
grahams
damn
this
be
smellin
good
the
taste
veers
off
this
course
a
bit
holding
notes
of
orange
peel
brown
sugar
pumpkin
shell
potato
skin
rye
bread
and
sour
cream
it
may
not
conform
to
the
smells
template
but
it
really
aint
too
bad
either
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
this
is
a
solid
punkin
brew
one
of
the
better
ive
yet
had
strong
alcohol
flavor
yet
very
smooth
and
warming
another
good
dessert
type
beer
from
southern
tier
had
this
ontap
at
jacob
wirth
tonight
at
the
harpoon
event
mishap
poured
a
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
tan
head
that
was
pretty
small
and
faded
fast
the
color
was
great
but
it
loses
some
points
for
the
lack
of
head
formed
the
smell
was
cinnamon
and
clove
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
earthy
pumpkin
some
molasses
and
brown
sugar
too
the
taste
was
much
like
the
nose
but
with
the
addition
of
sweet
cream
and
a
buttery
malt
flavor
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
exceptional
mouthfeel
was
rich
and
viscous
velvety
carbonated
like
others
of
the
style
but
much
heavier
overall
it
drank
like
a
stout
the
great
taste
and
feel
to
this
one
make
it
very
enjoyable
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
this
may
be
my
favorite
of
this
style
yet
d
if
you
want
to
drink
a
pumpkin
pie
this
is
it
though
not
quite
as
sweet
overall
i
was
impressed
this
beer
is
not
quite
the
end
all
be
all
of
pumpkin
beer
though
it
is
good
it
pours
with
a
orangish
hue
the
smell
is
of
pumpkin
and
spices
but
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
the
smell
lets
on
nicely
carbonated
with
a
dry
feel
though
i
could
not
imagine
polishing
off
more
than
1
bomber
of
these
in
an
ever
not
bad
if
sought
out
for
under
6
d
finishing
a
bomber
is
near
impossible
that
would
seem
like
finishing
an
entire
pie
for
me
this
displaces
dfh
punkin
as
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
always
look
forward
to
pumpkin
beers
im
not
as
crazy
about
pumking
as
some
folks
are
but
i
do
enjoy
it
something
about
this
seasons
brew
makes
it
slightly
less
enjoyable
than
last
years
version
of
the
handful
of
pumpkin
beers
ive
sampled
this
year
i
think
smuttynose
has
been
my
favorite
d
high
spice
level
and
abv
makes
it
more
a
sipper
but
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
tasty
i
do
recall
liking
last
years
a
bit
more
but
ill
still
be
picking
up
a
few
more
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
a
light
amberbrown
color
fizzy
with
medium
head
smells
include
sweet
brown
sugar
pumpkin
clove
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
taste
is
heavy
on
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
light
dashes
of
cinnamon
and
a
slightly
sour
finish
even
though
this
is
fairly
strong
it
is
hidden
pretty
well
solid
pumpkin
beer
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
beer
one
of
the
few
that
tastes
better
than
it
smells
it
tastes
just
like
a
pumpkin
pie
awesome
you
definitely
have
to
try
this
one
if
you
get
the
chance
best
pumpkin
beer
yet
for
me
d
good
beer
probably
the
best
you
can
get
for
the
style
maybe
a
little
too
big
still
a
great
beer
drinkability
is
high
a
bomber
of
this
is
not
out
of
the
question
what
so
ever
every
sip
warrants
another
pours
a
slight
hazy
burnt
orange
that
is
lighter
in
color
than
i
would
expect
it
to
be
the
head
is
a
nice
ecru
froth
that
slowly
fades
away
to
never
be
seen
from
again
the
smell
is
fantastic
it
smells
like
pumpkin
bread
its
making
me
salivate
thinking
about
it
right
now
that
translates
into
an
aroma
consisting
of
a
bready
yeast
smell
affixed
with
the
actual
pumpkin
smell
and
the
pumpkin
spices
which
seem
to
be
allspice
nutmeg
clove
cinnamon
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
ginger
the
taste
however
is
a
giant
let
down
from
the
smell
while
its
not
foul
in
anyway
i
expected
to
drink
pumpkin
bread
and
im
not
probably
shoulda
seen
that
from
the
color
the
taste
is
clearly
of
the
pumpkin
mixed
with
a
booze
flavor
that
is
more
consistent
with
vodka
than
anything
after
the
pumpkin
vodka
flavor
you
get
the
aftertaste
of
the
spices
and
that
is
all
that
you
are
left
with
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
which
helps
dilute
the
alcohol
flavor
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
pumpkin
ale
definitely
buy
this
its
pretty
damn
good
i
warn
you
you
must
be
in
the
mood
for
this
to
really
dig
it
d
being
that
its
so
overwhelmingly
pumpkin
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
at
once
nice
treat
this
time
of
year
d
this
has
set
the
bar
for
pumpkin
ales
for
me
an
incredible
beer
and
one
that
i
enjoyed
a
lot
despite
the
fact
that
i
normally
stray
away
from
this
style
notes
as
i
said
i
taste
so
much
ginger
but
maybe
i
am
just
overperceptive
of
it
i
love
pumpkin
beers
but
there
is
such
a
variety
since
they
are
all
spiced
you
have
to
find
the
ones
you
like
this
one
while
being
highly
regarded
just
isnt
for
me
i
still
rated
it
fairly
high
because
it
is
a
good
beer
and
i
dont
want
to
punish
it
just
because
i
dont
like
a
certain
ingredient
poured
from
bottle
into
oerbier
tulip
an
amazing
orange
light
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
smell
is
cinnamon
allspice
pumpkin
butter
light
bread
dough
a
little
brown
sugar
and
some
rosemary
not
much
hops
taste
follows
smell
cinnamon
and
buttery
dough
followed
by
brown
sugar
and
pumpkin
not
too
sweet
not
too
spicy
this
one
is
just
right
slight
hop
bitterness
finishes
mouth
feel
is
a
moderate
carbonation
just
enough
to
finish
clean
for
9
and
the
given
style
this
one
is
very
drinkable
not
all
of
sts
beers
hit
the
mark
but
this
one
is
good
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
so
far
a
note
to
all
the
haters
of
pumking
you
are
analyzing
too
much
into
this
st
has
crafted
an
ale
that
truly
exhibits
properties
of
what
was
intended
a
pumpkin
ale
that
is
consistent
to
craft
beer
to
put
this
brew
down
is
nothing
more
than
some
holier
than
though
beer
geek
getting
off
on
dissing
a
masterpiece
great
job
st
d
a
bit
strong
but
very
drinkable
tasty
delicious
and
the
smell
is
killer
best
pumpkin
style
beer
ive
had
because
when
i
think
pumpkin
ale
i
want
the
pumpkin
flavor
to
pop
and
have
the
spices
back
it
up
not
the
other
way
around
this
one
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
and
has
a
great
balance
of
pumpkinspice
and
sweetdryness
definitely
an
upperechelon
pumpkin
ale
and
wellworth
grabbing
a
bottle
and
drinking
one
when
the
weather
turns
cooler
a
dangerous
beer
soooo
tasty
and
the
alcohol
is
hardly
noticable
i
could
session
this
all
night
this
is
unlike
any
pumpkin
ale
out
there
an
absolutly
must
try
for
the
season
this
is
one
of
the
best
fall
beers
around
it
is
so
unique
and
tasty
i
think
that
any
type
of
beer
drinker
should
give
it
a
shot
maybe
it
was
a
bad
batch
or
something
because
we
could
barely
finish
the
beer
it
was
so
bad
i
will
defiantly
be
avoiding
this
beer
in
the
future
d
i
will
finish
this
bomber
enjoy
it
however
with
all
the
pumpkin
beers
out
there
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
quality
of
the
beer
it
is
a
quality
brew
pumpkin
beer
is
now
everywhere
and
it
is
such
a
seasonal
nich
beer
that
i
will
try
a
few
and
then
get
tired
of
the
flavor
profile
overall
not
bad
at
all
i
very
much
look
forward
to
having
this
beer
for
the
fall
season
and
will
miss
it
when
it
is
gone
overall
this
is
what
pumpkin
beers
should
really
aspire
to
taste
like
i
saw
this
on
tap
and
though
i
have
generally
despised
pumpkin
beers
so
far
i
figured
id
give
it
a
go
since
ive
never
seen
it
on
tap
near
my
hometown
im
happy
with
my
choice
i
think
if
i
were
to
go
for
another
pumpkin
beer
in
the
future
id
go
for
this
one
truly
is
the
pumking
d
all
in
all
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
maybe
a
bit
less
bready
taste
but
still
really
good
spices
not
quite
strong
enough
in
this
one
though
d
sorry
great
pumpkin
ale
this
is
still
my
fav
d
could
definitely
have
more
of
this
and
ive
already
had
a
full
bomber
definitely
a
goodgreat
pumpkin
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
yet
i
like
it
because
it
actually
has
some
balls
its
good
to
have
a
higher
alcohol
alternative
to
all
the
low
abv
beers
traditionally
drunk
in
the
autumn
season
this
beer
was
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
when
i
saw
it
in
the
store
try
it
by
the
way
i
think
the
recommended
serving
temperature
on
the
bottle
40f
if
way
too
cold
i
drank
todays
sample
from
the
refrigerator
and
let
it
warm
up
to
about
60f
before
i
finished
it
this
beer
really
comes
to
life
at
about
55
to
60f
the
next
one
im
trying
straight
from
my
basement
where
it
will
be
right
around
60f
to
start
so
this
is
my
first
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
nice
golden
browncopper
color
big
head
that
decreased
to
just
a
film
on
top
smelled
very
nice
nothing
spectacular
a
bit
of
pumpking
in
the
smell
taste
this
is
where
i
dont
quite
get
it
i
dont
taste
the
pumpkin
pie
that
a
lot
of
people
mention
not
that
its
bad
i
just
dont
taste
pumpkin
or
anything
other
than
a
creamy
beer
with
a
light
nice
spice
that
was
more
noticable
as
it
warmed
this
is
a
very
smooth
beer
very
very
enjoyable
and
it
hides
the
9
alcohol
dangerously
this
one
could
sneak
up
on
you
without
you
realizing
also
has
a
very
very
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
the
best
part
to
me
i
like
this
one
better
than
any
of
the
octoberfests
ive
tried
so
far
this
year
maybe
pumpkin
ales
are
the
way
to
go
for
me
in
the
fall
actually
id
prefer
this
to
most
brown
ales
ive
tried
too
not
something
id
crave
all
of
the
time
but
i
felt
like
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
as
long
as
i
could
stand
up
to
the
rather
high
alcohol
content
bravo
southern
tier
on
easily
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
d
this
is
definitely
an
upper
tier
pumpkin
ale
i
am
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
and
this
has
a
nice
distinctive
taste
to
it
and
at
9
abv
its
one
of
the
stronger
ones
out
there
but
doesnt
have
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
i
had
to
search
for
this
beer
and
it
was
definitely
worth
it
a
must
try
pumpkin
ale
bottle
says
to
pour
into
a
goblet
so
i
obey
and
this
produces
a
crappy
head
and
still
looking
beer
however
maybe
its
suppose
to
look
this
way
the
color
is
real
lovely
coppor
orange
tone
smells
like
spices
vanilla
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
nice
rich
taste
from
the
caramel
malts
and
assertive
hopping
great
spice
flavor
without
being
overwhelming
and
a
nice
pumpkinn
flavor
on
the
finish
feels
nice
a
thick
on
the
palate
this
is
probably
the
single
most
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
bring
it
on
i
had
to
dock
a
point
for
the
cloying
aftertaste
22oz
is
too
much
for
this
brew
id
love
to
see
it
in
a
four
pack
until
then
find
a
friend
or
two
to
split
the
bomber
with
solid
pumpkin
brew
taken
in
small
quantities
d
easily
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
so
happy
to
see
this
sold
in
maine
now
some
alcohol
comes
through
but
its
really
not
that
bad
considering
the
abv
second
half
of
the
bottle
was
a
little
cloying
but
thats
too
be
expected
as
normally
i
would
only
drink
one
glass
in
a
sitting
recommended
d
goes
down
easy
for
a
big
beer
it
nails
the
pumpkin
flavor
but
if
the
spices
were
stronger
and
more
complex
it
would
really
go
to
the
next
level
d
overall
pumking
is
without
question
towards
the
top
of
my
list
of
pumpkin
beers
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
this
one
is
a
must
try
drinkability
should
have
bought
more
than
one
shared
the
bottle
should
have
kept
it
for
myself
this
bottle
definitely
did
not
have
the
standout
pumpkin
pie
aroma
or
taste
that
was
present
in
other
reviews
another
week
or
two
might
have
brought
down
the
diacetyl
presence
and
imparted
more
of
the
pumpkin
flavor
was
still
a
nice
brew
will
go
back
for
more
overall
this
is
an
absolutely
awesome
pumpkin
beer
a
great
dessert
beer
but
careful
not
to
get
overloaded
on
spices
and
pumpkin
pours
a
clear
medium
orange
color
with
one
finger
foamy
white
head
couple
spots
of
lace
smell
canned
pumpkin
ready
for
making
pie
a
little
spicy
hop
pale
malt
and
pie
crust
taste
pumpkin
pie
if
you
left
out
some
of
the
sugar
similar
to
a
belgian
pale
with
a
bunch
of
pumpkin
dumped
in
pretty
great
drying
pie
spice
finish
d
the
abv
on
this
one
almost
limits
it
almost
like
i
said
earlier
this
beer
ranks
number
2
for
me
in
the
pumpkin
beer
catagory
go
southern
tier
i
definitely
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
to
enjoy
a
pumpkin
ale
but
as
far
as
rating
per
style
this
one
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
and
is
very
drinkable
though
the
transition
from
sweet
malty
pumpkin
and
spice
notes
to
the
bitter
finish
keep
this
from
getting
a
better
grade
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
ill
be
honest
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
or
anything
pumpkin
however
this
is
a
very
tasty
well
crafted
beer
its
a
nice
one
as
the
weather
changes
and
heads
into
fall
overall
per
style
i
now
know
why
this
beer
is
rated
so
damn
high
on
the
site
great
pumpkin
beer
and
i
will
easily
come
back
to
this
one
year
after
year
draft
pale
orange
like
an
unripe
loquat
smells
just
like
a
pumpkin
pie
taste
like
a
pumpkin
pie
with
a
lot
of
spices
nutmeg
is
the
strongest
spice
with
some
other
maybe
vanilla
and
cinnamon
included
has
a
sweet
imperial
aftertaste
but
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
mouth
feel
it
was
good
and
i
was
ready
for
it
in
september
it
might
be
a
little
much
in
november
dont
know
how
many
of
these
i
can
drink
in
a
season
but
the
first
one
was
very
tasty
drinkability
i
rated
somewhat
low
cause
its
so
spicy
and
flavorful
you
can
only
have
one
or
two
i
liked
the
beer
one
of
the
best
fall
beers
made
period
d
if
you
like
all
that
pumpkin
pie
spicing
in
your
pumpkin
ales
this
one
might
not
be
for
you
i
applaud
southern
tier
for
being
able
to
create
a
flavorful
9
abv
ale
that
had
a
true
pumpkin
flavor
rather
than
just
spices
and
vanilla
ill
likely
pick
up
another
bomber
for
the
season
seriously
what
was
so
wrong
about
the
previous
years
recipe
and
why
is
everyone
hopping
the
crap
out
of
pumpkin
beers
if
this
doesnt
change
i
may
swear
myself
off
the
style
altogether
this
one
is
okay
not
sure
if
i
would
have
again
other
than
at
a
thanksgiving
meal
it
is
just
like
previous
reviewers
have
said
pure
pumpkin
pie
i
am
glad
i
split
it
with
a
friend
it
wouldve
been
hard
to
finish
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
on
my
mothers
favorite
yankee
candle
though
i
can
see
why
people
may
like
this
beer
and
find
it
interesting
im
much
happier
with
akrons
pumpkin
ales
at
my
disposal
d
pretty
low
i
had
trouble
just
finishing
my
first
glass
and
i
struggled
to
polish
off
the
bomber
a
12
ounce
pour
of
this
beer
after
dinner
would
be
about
perfect
but
the
sweetness
and
warming
alcohol
make
this
very
hard
to
finish
a
bomber
another
example
of
the
large
bottle
format
detracting
from
a
beer
overall
i
know
im
copping
out
but
i
really
want
to
try
this
one
again
next
to
schlaflys
my
wife
likes
schlaflys
better
but
im
still
not
sure
the
nose
on
this
one
alone
may
put
it
over
the
edge
d
drinkable
for
the
style
but
still
1
bomb
is
good
for
me
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
out
beware
do
not
let
this
beer
warm
though
because
the
alcohol
becomes
too
prominent
d
a
really
good
pumpkin
ale
i
thought
it
smelled
amazing
but
wish
the
taste
was
a
little
sweeter
as
opposed
to
spicey
never
the
less
a
great
fall
beer
i
will
definitely
have
again
the
best
pumpkin
beer
in
the
world
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
only
my
second
experience
with
pumpkin
ales
so
maybe
i
just
dont
get
it
yet
i
may
try
this
beer
again
if
i
see
it
on
tap
but
probably
wont
by
it
in
the
bottle
again
pretty
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
pumpkin
ales
usually
not
my
thing
and
most
of
st
beers
i
find
undrinkable
actually
this
is
the
best
st
brew
ive
had
overall
i
was
always
hard
on
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
is
actually
a
quality
beer
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
a
great
beer
for
the
season
will
have
again
for
sure
southern
tier
knocks
this
one
out
of
the
park
truly
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
and
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
beers
in
general
if
you
dont
like
pumpkin
brews
this
may
not
be
for
you
but
damn
is
this
delicious
talk
about
a
let
down
i
hope
last
years
wasnt
like
this
7
2
last
year
because
this
surely
failed
to
live
up
to
the
hype
i
will
never
buy
this
beer
for
personal
drinking
again
ever
if
all
i
did
was
smell
this
awesome
too
bad
i
had
to
drink
it
it
has
a
distracting
heat
flavor
and
feeling
this
might
be
a
beer
i
need
to
review
again
in
say
about
a
year
after
ive
sampled
many
different
pumpkin
ales
d
well
im
in
quite
the
pickle
here
this
is
tasty
and
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
my
problem
is
this
beer
used
to
be
so
much
better
the
first
time
around
this
stuff
was
damn
near
a
stout
now
its
like
a
pumpkin
ipa
is
it
still
the
best
pumpkin
ale
out
there
yes
just
a
shadow
of
its
former
self
such
a
shame
medium
bodied
with
assertive
alcohol
on
the
tongue
but
not
overpowering
bitter
finish
due
to
the
hops
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
know
people
say
how
the
alcohol
was
barely
noticeable
all
the
time
but
in
this
case
it
is
true
it
tasted
closer
to
7
than
9
two
bombers
over
the
course
of
an
evening
would
be
doable
d
extremely
drinkable
and
hard
to
tell
that
its
9
wow
i
like
this
style
brew
it
certainly
isnt
my
favorite
style
to
indulge
in
it
has
its
place
for
sure
to
me
this
so
far
is
the
best
i
have
had
of
this
style
not
overdone
perfectly
drinkable
and
very
tasty
try
a
few
every
year
to
usher
in
the
fall
season
very
good
stuff
absolutely
love
this
beer
smell
and
taste
of
pumpkin
which
so
delicious
the
taste
of
pumpkin
actually
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
and
more
unfortunately
this
beer
is
9
abv
so
drinking
a
couple
you
will
be
completely
wasted
worth
it
to
taste
and
worth
it
to
smell
this
pumpkin
ale
no
other
beer
like
it
notes
with
the
high
ratings
this
beer
gets
i
was
shocked
at
how
underwhelming
i
found
it
i
do
like
pumpkin
beers
dfh
punkin
ale
and
brooklyns
post
road
are
great
i
just
found
this
one
to
be
lacking
i
expect
more
sweetness
and
boldness
of
flavors
in
a
pumpkin
beer
and
this
one
had
neither
i
may
try
it
again
though
perhaps
i
just
had
a
bad
bottle
i
will
be
buying
a
case
or
two
or
three
of
this
to
last
me
until
next
year
d
one
bottle
as
a
treat
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
would
not
drink
all
the
time
but
one
or
two
bottles
a
year
will
do
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
d
doesnt
go
down
too
quick
which
is
probably
good
9
but
is
definitely
drinkable
as
a
dessertseasonal
brew
obviously
not
intended
for
every
occasion
drinkability
highly
drinkable
will
be
drinking
as
much
of
this
as
i
can
over
the
next
couple
of
months
whenif
you
find
this
on
your
shelves
give
it
a
whirl
you
wont
be
disappointed
i
loved
this
brew
drinkability
is
a
fail
for
me
pumpkin
puree
makes
this
suck
oh
pumpkin
beers
this
one
fails
to
break
the
mold
of
similar
brews
which
consistently
disappoint
me
drinkability
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
the
alcohol
is
wellmasked
and
the
flavors
are
intense
but
all
of
them
work
well
together
while
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
one
of
the
most
beautiful
brewing
masterpieces
to
ever
pass
my
lips
i
have
liked
the
other
pumpkin
beers
i
have
tried
but
this
one
is
by
far
the
best
not
only
is
this
a
great
pumpkin
beer
it
is
just
a
great
beer
i
will
be
enjoying
this
one
all
autumn
long
but
as
soon
as
fall
turns
to
winter
i
dont
know
what
ill
do
about
the
cravings
i
will
inevitably
have
d
very
complete
pumpkin
beer
other
years
have
been
a
little
too
candylike
and
this
years
higher
abv
is
unnoticeable
overall
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
out
there
bought
plenty
of
this
to
get
me
through
the
fall
this
year
this
should
mellow
out
a
bit
and
probably
improve
in
a
few
months
now
drinkability
great
pumpkin
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
amazing
nose
and
flavor
there
are
way
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
this
one
is
like
a
candy
bar
that
happens
to
have
9
abv
d
well
the
9
abv
does
not
come
through
at
all
it
is
quite
sweet
but
it
is
a
very
nice
dessert
beer
and
tremendously
better
than
any
other
other
pumpkin
beer
ive
tried
it
is
also
a
nice
change
from
other
dessert
type
beers
like
imperial
stouts
and
barleywines
salud
d
the
beer
is
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
southern
tier
its
a
good
pumpkin
beer
and
it
smells
pretty
good
the
taste
is
alright
but
i
feel
it
should
be
sweeter
or
spicier
they
definitely
have
the
pumpkin
part
down
it
doesnt
seem
to
meld
well
with
itself
enough
to
be
a
constant
drinker
pours
a
light
brownamber
with
an
offwhite
head
smells
of
pumpkin
pie
cinnamon
and
spices
big
flavor
graham
cracker
pumpkin
pie
and
vanilla
are
the
most
dominant
very
well
done
hints
of
cinnamon
all
spice
and
brown
sugar
as
well
slight
hops
and
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
warming
as
well
very
sweet
beer
creamy
mouthfeel
and
very
rich
o
not
my
favorite
southern
tier
selection
by
a
long
shot
and
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
either
still
this
beer
is
quite
respectable
and
may
improve
over
time
i
will
be
picking
up
a
few
to
cellar
for
the
holidays
d
man
i
dont
know
what
i
was
thinking
last
time
i
had
this
this
stuff
is
incredible
i
need
to
stock
up
one
of
the
more
intense
pumkin
ales
ive
gotten
my
hands
on
and
its
definitely
not
disappointing
smells
like
halloween
delicious
spicy
scent
of
nutmeg
exactly
like
some
tasty
pumpkin
pie
taste
pretty
much
follows
suit
doesnt
taste
anything
like
your
typical
beer
but
its
something
to
be
sought
out
in
its
own
right
an
autumnal
treat
to
be
savored
really
enjoyable
very
mealy
wouldnt
want
more
than
the
22
oz
bottle
i
had
but
thoroughly
loved
what
i
did
have
a
great
pumpkin
ale
drinkability
i
really
didnt
like
this
beer
its
far
too
sweet
and
nothing
like
you
would
imagine
it
to
be
being
an
imperial
pumpkin
it
doesnt
feature
enough
pumpkin
or
spices
id
recommend
anything
that
isnt
pumking
this
beer
could
give
you
diabetes
d
4
5
d
i
dig
this
i
would
drink
a
ton
of
this
if
it
were
available
in
the
bay
area
enjoyable
but
the
mouthfeel
could
use
some
work
d
similar
fate
as
the
mouthfeel
for
me
just
like
with
actual
pumpkin
pie
only
with
an
extra
pound
of
sugar
mixed
in
o
weird
beer
wonder
if
it
was
better
fresh
it
also
has
a
hefty
physicality
to
it
that
makes
it
seem
almost
as
if
it
is
filled
with
pumpkin
bits
taste
has
mellowed
out
and
melded
together
a
bit
over
the
past
7
months
which
is
a
good
thing
when
having
so
many
of
them
in
the
cellar
having
said
that
i
do
not
see
it
improving
much
more
and
a
fresh
pumking
around
halloween
will
be
better
than
a
year
old
version
the
spices
are
there
aplenty
with
nutmeg
and
allspice
leading
the
way
but
i
am
sure
there
is
a
gaggle
of
others
tagging
along
for
the
ride
perhaps
some
mace
and
cinnamon
caramely
malts
have
a
hint
of
toast
but
this
still
remains
one
of
the
sweetest
beers
i
have
ever
had
a
bomber
is
almost
too
much
to
handle
by
myself
not
that
there
isnt
some
hops
in
here
there
is
on
the
finish
and
combine
with
the
spices
to
dry
things
out
a
bit
but
wow
talk
about
a
dessert
beer
very
good
brew
and
one
of
the
most
unique
and
finest
examples
of
the
style
every
beer
lover
should
get
the
opportunity
to
try
this
concoction
at
least
once
overall
this
is
a
different
beast
from
the
bottle
than
on
tap
much
better
on
tap
imo
md
very
good
brew
from
southern
tier
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
brews
sold
spices
mixed
with
caramel
and
malts
a
for
sure
pick
up
i
will
get
this
again
drinkability
this
beer
screams
fall
and
i
cant
imagine
drinking
anything
else
but
this
delicious
beer
fresh
off
tap
during
the
fall
season
pairs
great
with
most
of
the
food
of
the
season
as
well
probably
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
best
pumpkin
ale
out
there
that
ive
had
nice
and
big
with
hops
with
actual
pumpkin
with
8
alc
great
fallwinter
brew
one
i
will
look
for
every
year
d
im
not
a
pumpkin
pie
fan
but
this
is
really
really
good
and
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
amazingly
smooth
for
its
abv
too
i
had
no
idea
this
was
9
until
i
was
about
halfway
into
the
large
bottle
drinkability
i
have
wanted
to
try
this
one
for
a
very
long
time
i
am
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
i
really
hope
this
one
wins
me
over
body
is
a
glowing
orange
amber
that
hosts
a
two
finger
frothy
light
beige
head
that
has
decent
retention
but
leaves
no
lace
nose
is
absolutely
delicious
by
itself
with
distinctive
tones
of
pumpkin
bread
and
creamy
eggnog
with
first
sip
you
get
a
very
soft
pumpkin
profile
not
harsh
at
all
sweet
bready
notes
are
all
over
the
tongue
a
dusting
of
cinnamon
and
graham
crackers
are
easy
to
pick
up
on
the
sides
and
back
of
the
tongue
this
beer
is
velvety
for
the
style
and
a
lot
like
cake
as
it
provokes
thoughts
of
desert
mouthfeel
is
very
much
like
sweet
dough
with
a
hint
of
spice
this
beer
is
so
lovely
drinkable
be
it
somewhat
thick
and
sweet
i
wish
i
had
a
bunch
of
this
in
the
cellar
for
the
holiday
for
many
years
to
come
overall
i
love
the
taste
and
smell
of
this
beer
if
they
can
add
better
head
retention
to
it
this
could
easily
move
way
up
my
list
a
little
whipped
cream
with
the
pumpkin
pie
would
be
awesome
bottle
many
thanks
to
hogtownharry
for
this
one
very
nice
appearance
bright
orange
pour
with
a
bit
of
white
head
lots
of
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
a
hint
of
spice
gingerbread
something
roasted
about
it
too
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
very
desert
pumpkin
pie
not
very
sweet
with
definite
alcohol
presence
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
a
little
too
aggressive
im
glad
i
split
this
with
my
dad
the
day
after
thanksgiving
next
year
ill
try
it
again
not
very
drinkable
to
me
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
creamy
like
a
cream
sickle
but
frothy
like
a
spiced
pumpkin
cider
i
often
avoid
pumpkin
beer
but
pumpking
will
get
a
repeat
visit
from
this
avid
fan
of
southern
tier
who
is
being
won
over
to
such
alternative
fall
beverages
terrific
stuff
definately
worth
a
try
but
overall
this
is
not
much
more
than
a
novelty
beer
a
good
one
though
that
said
22
ounces
was
plenty
time
to
move
on
now
overall
this
will
be
a
hard
one
to
finish
i
have
had
several
and
usually
mix
with
boulevard
wheat
to
thin
out
the
cloying
flavors
ok
but
not
as
good
as
last
year
i
dont
find
it
as
harmonized
and
smooth
as
it
should
be
for
us
dutch
its
a
strange
beer
we
dont
taste
pumkin
that
mutch
pumking
is
the
king
of
pumpkin
beers
in
my
opinion
i
like
plenty
but
love
few
of
this
unique
but
often
overly
perfumed
and
overly
spiced
style
southern
tiers
offering
appeals
to
me
because
despite
the
distinct
pumpkinpie
flavouring
and
spices
and
high
alcohol
it
drinks
just
like
an
easily
quaffed
quality
ipa
i
cannot
recommend
it
enough
pours
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
strong
pumpkin
with
caramel
malt
and
toasted
malt
very
inviting
the
flavor
is
very
strong
with
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
allspice
and
ginger
the
spice
gets
less
apparent
as
it
warms
up
the
beer
is
very
sweet
and
has
a
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
tried
poured
out
a
nice
copper
color
into
my
glass
smells
like
i
am
about
to
drink
a
pumpkin
pie
taste
just
like
it
smells
right
up
front
is
the
pumpkin
pie
filling
followed
by
the
taste
of
the
graham
cracker
crust
and
then
a
subtle
finish
of
the
whipped
toppingvanilla
just
sweeps
across
the
tongue
i
can
do
a
bottle
but
after
that
it
would
be
hard
to
try
and
do
another
great
a
bottle
at
a
time
but
anything
more
might
be
to
much
for
me
d
so
easy
to
put
down
o
i
would
say
its
arguably
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
drinkabiliy
is
average
i
do
rate
on
a
curve
with
imperials
with
tons
of
forward
flavor
but
lacks
the
allure
of
others
i
have
had
due
to
its
extreme
nature
this
beer
is
a
gem
comming
from
a
guy
who
has
drank
a
ton
of
pumpkin
ales
and
havent
enjoyed
many
d
for
the
money
i
dont
think
theres
a
better
pumpkinfall
spiced
beer
out
there
ive
had
many
especially
those
that
are
more
prominent
on
the
pumpkin
flavor
but
this
beer
just
seems
to
do
it
right
in
so
many
ways
that
i
keep
coming
back
to
it
each
year
truly
a
fall
treat
to
look
forward
to
as
summer
draws
to
a
close
overall
a
great
smelling
pumpkin
beer
that
is
the
best
tasting
one
ive
had
yet
the
heavy
spices
took
down
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
somewhat
recommend
as
its
the
best
pumpkin
ale
that
ive
had
rotation
not
avail
tx
got
in
trade
as
said
before
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
and
generally
only
have
12
per
year
so
wont
be
a
player
in
the
rotation
would
try
ontap
though
drinkability
not
bad
but
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
for
me
and
i
have
definitely
had
better
offerings
over
the
course
of
the
season
that
strange
metallic
bitterness
really
is
the
overall
downer
to
it
pours
a
pumpkin
orange
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
froth
and
decent
lacing
strong
roasted
aromas
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
roasted
hazelnuts
cloves
cooked
pumpkin
grains
are
followed
by
flavors
of
vanilla
roasted
nuts
spices
a
hint
of
molasses
there
is
a
bit
of
heat
on
the
back
end
definitely
a
food
beer
although
you
can
absolutely
have
this
for
a
meal
instead
overall
a
good
roasty
beer
that
unfortunately
i
find
over
spiced
i
was
really
looking
for
a
betterthicker
mouthfeel
and
a
more
profound
pumpkin
presence
i
had
found
a
lot
of
hype
surrounding
this
beer
and
i
felt
a
little
let
down
its
good
but
not
worth
the
hype
in
my
opinion
d
this
is
up
there
with
dfh
punkin
as
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
that
ive
had
it
excels
in
the
body
aspect
and
is
much
richer
and
fuller
compared
to
a
host
of
others
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
worth
a
try
d
easily
quaffable
but
the
flavors
are
best
revealed
when
sipped
i
think
that
the
richness
of
this
beer
makes
it
best
for
just
one
or
two
glasses
before
moving
on
to
another
style
side
note
this
beer
pairs
wonderfully
with
homemade
pumpkin
pie
the
imperial
pumpkin
pours
a
brilliant
orange
color
with
a
2
finger
lacy
head
that
hangs
atop
lots
of
carbonated
bubbles
are
present
nose
is
spiced
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
of
course
pumpkin
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
but
what
really
surprised
me
is
how
smooth
this
is
with
the
9
abv
punch
no
alcohol
is
noted
in
the
quaff
and
the
taste
is
very
complex
and
nice
mouth
is
medium
body
and
drinkability
is
solid
i
love
the
taste
and
the
big
punch
it
carries
this
is
my
time
of
year
and
def
my
type
of
beer
draft
sierra
amazing
bright
orange
color
with
aromas
of
rich
spice
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
almost
creamy
nose
the
palate
follows
perfectly
with
those
notes
and
is
the
best
pumpkin
ive
had
yet
liquid
pumpkin
pie
like
mom
used
to
make
so
rich
and
flavorful
that
i
couldnt
get
over
how
this
was
the
best
fall
beer
to
date
nothing
cloying
or
harsh
about
it
viva
la
fall
its
a
festive
tasting
drink
id
say
it
was
probably
more
vanilla
and
clove
than
pumpkin
but
whatever
im
not
pumpkin
loyal
it
was
nice
to
try
it
we
are
all
better
off
for
people
like
southern
tier
trying
new
stuff
out
but
having
said
that
i
dont
think
i
want
to
have
another
its
definitely
a
taste
thing
im
sure
plenty
of
folks
will
enjoy
this
d
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
i
can
where
some
people
might
like
this
beer
as
its
quite
different
from
other
pumpkin
ales
but
i
just
did
not
like
the
beer
very
much
drinkabilityive
had
this
before
and
probably
will
again
a
very
unique
pumpkin
brew
kind
of
in
its
own
league
this
brew
is
really
growing
on
me
glad
i
didnt
review
it
earlier
drinks
very
well
and
is
undoubtedly
enjoyable
alcohol
seems
to
be
masked
and
delivers
no
ill
effect
from
the
higher
abv
pumpkin
ale
in
the
top
two
in
the
category
if
you
ask
me
medium
bodied
with
a
huge
spicy
pumpkin
pie
flavor
lots
of
cinnamon
brown
sugar
clove
ginger
nutmeg
and
a
very
strong
pumpkin
presence
theres
a
slight
touch
of
vanilla
and
some
sweetcaramel
malt
the
abv
is
extremely
well
masked
without
even
a
slight
touch
of
alcohol
heat
making
it
extremely
quaffable
probably
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
had
yet
this
beer
looks
like
pumpkin
pie
the
head
looks
like
whipped
cream
on
top
of
pumpkin
pie
this
beer
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
this
beer
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
in
my
mouth
this
beer
feels
like
pumpkin
pie
if
you
like
pumpkin
pie
you
will
like
this
beer
if
you
do
not
like
pumpkin
pie
you
will
not
like
this
beer
i
really
like
pumpkin
pie
so
i
really
like
this
beer
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
the
color
is
an
amberorange
with
a
small
to
medium
head
that
is
very
cloying
to
the
glass
the
smell
is
immediately
pumpkin
with
ginger
cinnamon
allspice
upon
first
taste
you
can
taste
and
smell
all
the
spices
and
pumpkin
but
its
the
aftertaste
that
gets
the
win
here
about
2
seconds
in
you
start
to
taste
gingerbreadgraham
cracker
crust
of
the
pie
the
aftertaste
is
even
more
pleasing
leaving
you
feeling
like
you
just
ate
a
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
mouthfeel
is
heavy
and
thick
but
not
overwhelming
drinkability
is
extremely
high
as
are
most
of
southern
tier
products
this
is
top
shelf
right
here
arguably
the
best
pumpkin
ale
out
today
drinkability
pretty
high
nice
pumpkin
beer
overall
but
maybe
not
quite
the
king
of
pumps
or
pums
i
guess
what
happened
to
the
other
p
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
although
just
another
one
and
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
enjoys
a
liquid
pumpkin
pie
this
is
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
it
is
so
warming
the
alcohol
is
perfectly
balanced
with
the
malts
and
spices
it
is
completely
drinkable
and
one
that
when
its
gone
i
wish
i
had
more
i
think
i
might
like
it
more
if
it
had
a
different
name
overall
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
whole
one
to
myself
it
is
true
that
this
beer
has
an
interesting
unique
flavor
compared
to
other
pumpkin
beers
i
would
call
it
more
sugary
than
pumpkinyspicy
there
are
other
pumpkin
beers
that
taste
much
more
like
pumpkin
to
me
the
sugar
taste
in
front
and
hops
at
the
back
just
didnt
combine
in
a
pleasing
way
for
me
d
notes
ive
had
my
share
of
pumpkin
pies
maybe
not
enough
and
i
rather
like
them
but
this
one
is
certainly
not
close
to
anything
ive
tasted
before
its
as
if
the
cook
dropped
the
whole
jar
of
spices
and
a
pack
sugar
by
accident
and
let
them
roll
i
like
what
st
does
with
this
provocative
beer
that
often
are
hit
or
miss
for
drinkers
this
is
the
first
one
that
is
a
miss
for
me
i
dont
know
how
to
use
it
it
could
be
a
dessert
beer
but
i
dont
have
the
audience
that
would
like
this
type
of
highly
spiced
flavor
for
a
pumpkin
pie
not
a
bad
ale
but
its
not
much
of
a
pleasing
brew
for
me
and
id
rather
choose
quite
a
few
other
pumpkin
beers
ahead
of
this
one
lightmedium
body
and
id
almost
call
it
undercarbonated
and
a
little
thin
that
said
its
still
incredibly
easy
to
drink
for
a
beer
weighing
in
at
9
very
good
pumpkin
beer
but
ive
got
to
give
the
title
to
smuttynose
although
its
imperial
it
doesnt
feel
or
taste
like
a
big
beer
its
very
smooth
i
feel
as
if
i
could
drink
a
six
pack
easily
it
was
served
with
a
finger
of
foamy
bubbling
ecru
head
that
quickly
gave
way
to
wispiness
color
was
a
fittingly
orangish
deepamber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
like
sniffing
a
pumpkin
pie
fresh
out
of
the
oven
cinnamon
clove
and
nutmeg
it
was
like
halloween
in
a
glass
mouthfeel
was
full
almost
creamy
in
its
texture
the
interplay
of
the
spices
on
the
tongue
was
simply
heavenly
if
i
closed
my
eyes
i
could
envision
thanksgiving
dessert
therein
lies
its
achilles
heel
it
is
a
noveltydessert
beer
it
is
too
sweet
to
be
sessionable
but
it
is
a
treat
while
it
is
available
get
some
today
may
i
die
in
the
early
spring
so
as
not
to
miss
out
drinkability
believe
the
hype
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
there
is
it
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
and
despite
the
high
abv
remains
light
and
smooth
delicious
d
this
beer
is
a
special
treat
and
a
great
beverage
for
halloween
it
is
delicious
but
the
flavor
can
get
overwhelming
over
the
course
of
22oz
this
one
is
better
to
share
and
enjoy
in
small
servings
ive
been
saving
this
one
in
my
basement
for
quite
a
while
and
it
has
definately
aged
nicely
without
knowing
what
its
like
fresh
or
having
a
date
on
the
bottle
one
can
only
guess
one
thing
is
clear
though
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
ale
i
suspect
this
is
a
very
fine
example
for
the
style
i
admit
i
dont
care
for
the
style
but
tried
to
rate
according
to
style
this
is
clearly
a
wellcrafted
beer
and
i
am
glad
for
the
diversity
i
will
stick
to
pumpkin
pies
and
sweet
breads
d
i
could
definitely
drink
a
bunch
of
these
nice
and
crisp
and
it
really
does
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
if
you
dont
really
like
pumpkin
i
can
see
one
not
really
liking
this
however
for
anyone
that
loves
pumpkin
pie
or
similarly
flavored
things
definitely
try
this
you
will
love
it
happy
halloween
overall
best
pumpkin
brew
i
ever
had
highly
recommend
anyone
who
wants
a
nice
hearty
halloween
treat
cheers
d
good
for
a
very
heavy
beer
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
then
may
get
hit
by
the
alcohol
train
a
half
hour
later
drinkability
this
is
very
good
an
interesting
for
the
style
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
i
love
the
vanilla
in
the
beer
and
the
strong
hops
bring
something
new
to
the
table
i
could
have
a
couple
a
season
big
points
for
making
a
pumpkin
beer
complex

why

definitely
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
out
there
the
spices
in
this
are
not
as
intense
as
others
just
in
the
aftertaste
i
had
to
drain
pour
this
sampled
92408
brewed
to
19
plato
with
tworow
and
some
late
hop
bitterness
that
is
a
touch
high
something
just
a
little
too
spicy
and
pumpkiny
without
the
basic
tenants
of
beer
being
there
to
balance
it
out

but
strictly
a
seasonal
treat
in
my
opinion
its
not
something
i
would
drink
more
than
one
bottle
in
a
sitting
more
malt
laden
type
of
character

pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
for
drinkability
on
its
own
some
hop
bitterness
and
sweet
caramel

this
is
one
hell
of
a

everyone
told
me
how
amazing
it
was

that

had
to
try

was

best
then
one

2

in

drink
and
review
i
will
certainly
buy
this
again
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
good
representation
of
the
style
i
have
been
flagged
as
an
outlier
it
looks
like
i
should
really
not
be
rating
pumpkin
ales
as
even
a
highly
regarded
one
such
as
this
tastes
like
a
rotten
starbucks
latte
to
me
just
late
in
the
season
for
it
carbonation
isnt
there
still
has
a
good
front
and
nose
on
it
tho
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
o
weyerbacher
makes
an
excellent
imperial
pumpkin
smooth
complex
and
tasty
right
off
the
bat
i
get
that
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
aroma
pour
out
a
nice
inch
12
head
nice
sunburst
color
to
it
light
body
but
with
a
heavier
finnish
i
get
a
lot
of
the
malt
flavors
as
well
which
may
be
also
from
the
cardamom
definitely
get
that
ginger
taste
from
it
very
good
pumpkin
ale
just
easy
on
them
since
they
are
8
not
a
fan
way
too
sweet
way
too
much
seasoning
i
dont
mind
flavor
in
beer
such
as
spice
but
this
one
was
awash
with
sweetness
clove
cinnamon
and
cardamon
the
aroma
alone
rivals
that
of
a
pumpkin
spice
candle
if
you
really
really
enjoy
pumpkin
ales
i
would
recommend
this
beer
because
it
has
3x
the
flavor
of
your
average
pumpkin
ale
price
point
1
6712
oz
single
great
fall
beer
certainly
better
than
your

pumpkin
ale
not
overly
spiced
but
still
possessing
some
depth
and
nuance
nice
notes
of
pumpkin
vanilla
cinnamon
and
caramel
doesnt
hide
its
booze
well
though
thats
the
biggest
strike
against
it

for
my
palate
o
not
as
creamy
or
carbonated
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
the
sour
start
is
a
turnoff
not
bad
but
ive
had
much
better
a
very
real
pumpkin
beer
would
def
try
it
again
pours
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
aromas
are
extremely
literal
on
the
pumpkin
spice
big
notes
of
cloves
and
nutmeg
dominate
with
brown
sugary
sweetness
extremely
sweet
like
pumpkin
pie
on
the
palate
very
smooth
body
with
a
spicy
think
red
hots
and
cinnamon
midpalate
finishes
on
notes
similar
to
some
of
the
cinnamon
whiskeys
that
are
currently
in
vogue
an
excellent
choice
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
that
take
the
pumpkin
pie
challenge
at
face
value
good
pumpkin
you
wont
be
disappointed
nice
tasting
beer
not
too
over
powering
pumpkin
taste
a
good
tasty
pumpkin
o
a
middle
of
the
road
pumpkin
for
me
good
but
had
better
lots
of
spices
powerful
aroma
not
overly
pumpkiny
at
all
a
great
beer
for
the
later
end
of
fall
if
you
like
this
try
fegleys
devious
imperial
pumpkin
disappointing
second
only
to
schlafly
tastes
like
double
crooked
tree
with
a
hint
of
pumkin
and
spice
great
flavor
though
a
little
boozy
tasting
even
so
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
good
pumpkin
beer
not
very
bitter
but
with
a
good
amount
of
head
the
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
really
come
out
leaves
a
good
subtle
taste
in
your
mouth
drank
out
of
a
glass
with
a
rim
of
butter
and
cinnamon
and
sugar
so
delicious
definitely
the
right
way
to
enjoy
this
brew
all
in
all
a
decent
pick
i
finally
decided
to
give
weyerbachers
imperial
pumpkin
a
try
and
im
sure
glad
i
bought
a
single
instead
of
a
four
pack
all
spices
with
no
concession
to
the
pumpkin
or
base
beer
this
was
a
one
and
done
for
me
lots
of
pumpkin
and
a
somewhat
unique
spice
profile
with
cardamom
added
to
the
usual
mix
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
cloves
but
thats
not
enough
to
take
this
beer
to
the
top
its
a
big
beer
but
a
bit
too
big
for
its
britches
the
alcohol
is
hard
to
miss
in
this
brew
a
shame
since
ive
had
a
few
imperial
pumpkin
ales
that
specialize
in
hiding
the
alcohol
and
accentuating
the
pumpkin
or
spice
characteristics
not
a
bad
choice
and
one
id
like
to
try
again
but
one
that
i
dont
think
makes
it
to
the
top
of
my
list
of
pumpkin
brews
i
repeat
rdevs
review
just
loved
this
perfect
pumpkin
ale
the
picture
is
wrong
though
that
must
be
a
prior
season
i
love
this
beer
i
guess
i
am
nostalgic
about
it
it
taste
exactly
like
my
mothers
pumpkin
pie
it
has
just
the
right
spice
level
its
hardy
its
got
a
slightly
thick
mouth
feel
but
not
muddy
more
velvety
at
8
5
its
got
a
little
heat
to
it
as
well
this
beer
is
fall
and
will
be
my
autumn
go
to
ale
for
the
season
overall
i
looked
forward
to
this
beer
and
physically
came
to
see
my
friend
to
have
this
and
a
few
other
beers
and
attend
an
event
every
fall
the
memories
are
what
now
make
this
beer
o
exceptional
the
pumpkin
beer
for
people
who
hate
pumpkin
beersmeaning
the
pumpkin
beer
for
folks
who
usually
find
them
too
spiced
too
sweet
etc
a
study
in
balance
and
the
only
pumpkin
ale
i
can
stomach
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
not
an
easy
feet
and
at
8
o
not
bad
but
not
up
there
with
other
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
even
so
far
this
year
this
is
one
of
the
few
that
can
be
compared
to
the
pumking
very
good
spice
and
pumpkin
flavors
ooverall
i
like
this
beer
it
prefect
for
your
pumpkin
ale
fix
if
there
is
no
pumking
or
schlafly
overall
pretty
good
ale
id
like
the
pumpkin
flavor
to
be
a
bit
more
obvious
but
otherwise
is
a
great
beer
the
cinnamon
is
a
bit
too
upfront
and
over
powering
the
pumpkin
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
overall
a
passable
pumpkin
ale
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
the
appearance
is
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
khaki
tan
head
that
traces
the
glass
the
smell
is
full
of
pumpkin
and
spice
like
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
taste
is
straightforward
with
pumpkin
and
almost
a
sour
taste
that
compliments
the
sweetness
of
all
the
pie
spices
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
also
had
good
consistency
and
i
would
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
pours
orange
and
amost
opaque
except
for
a
haze
that
let
light
in
and
made
this
beer
a
bit
of
pastel
nose
is
ginger
bright
ginger
and
nutmeg
not
too
much
cinnamon
and
thank
goodness
for
that
bit
of
allspice
and
clove
and
lastly
cinnamon
this
beer
has
the
bitter
scent
of
the
actual
pumpkin
on
it
via
touch
of
grass
from
hops
lovely
weyerbacher
has
deliiverd
quite
the
abv
in
this
beer
8
to
warm
a
bit
as
it
finishes
but
first
a
bold
pumpkin
flavor
with
a
bit
of
sourness
or
of
twang
if
you
will
like
the
pumpkin
and
like
the
pumpkin
pie
it
has
a
dry
crust
for
malt
dry
floury
and
not
too
sweet
so
a
biscuit
malt
lightly
over
the
top
is
a
touch
of
bright
honey
to
go
with
he
bright
ginger
and
now
i
am
really
excited
no
diacetyl
except
in
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
buttery
sensation
adds
to
this
creamy
beer
with
a
decent
bitterdespite
its
abv
a
touch
of
hop
grass
and
bitter
finish
this
one
like
a
surprise
and
wow
a
great
imperial
pumpkin
ale
from
wyerbacher
that
tastes
like
an
ale
and
has
a
great
abv
to
kick
it
home
i
really
love
the
aroma
of
this
beer
i
was
hit
with
cinnamon
spice
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
pie
all
layered
perfectly
in
my
opinion
the
taste
itself
doesnt
fully
live
up
to
its
aroma
it
still
is
pleasant
but
is
a
little
bit
overpowered
with
spice
and
nutmeg
also
i
feel
the
beer
isnt
as
focused
on
displaying
pumpkin
flavor
my
first
taste
i
got
very
strong
notes
of
all
its
other
elements
cinnamon
nutmeg
etc
it
just
took
me
a
little
while
to
pick
out
where
i
found
the
pumpkin
flavor
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
good
beer
just
not
exactly
what
i
prefer
i
just
poured
my
first
bottle
of
this
and
the
smell
was
wonderful
my
taste
buds
were
looking
forward
to
enjoying
what
my
nose
already
had
boy
something
wrong
here
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
thats
about
where
things
go
south
sour
mash
like
taste
with
a
cinnamon
follow
almost
like
this
batch
had
too
much
nutmeg
or
the
bottle
was
bad
opened
a
second
one
with
the
same
results
really
sour
with
an
almost
harsh
nutmeg
aftertaste
i
really
dont
think
ill
buy
this
one
again
after
drinking
so
many
other
pumpkin
beers
this
fall
that
have
proved
far
more
enjoyable
than
this
a
good
pumpkin
beer
but
still
inferior
to
southern
tiers
sweeter
pumking
overall
this
beer
could
be
perfect
but
for
me
it
is
overly
spiced
i
love
all
the
fall
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
but
they
need
to
be
complimented
by
actual
pumpkin
flavors
also
would
prefer
slightly
less
carbonation
one
of
my
better
options
for
the
season
but
if
im
strictly
basing
my
review
on
what
id
like
in
a
perfect
pumpkin
beer
i
need
more
pumpkin

overall
this
is
probably
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
and
pumpkin
ale
is
probably
my
beer
style
i
let
this
beer
sit
in
my
fridge
for
a
two
or
so
months
not
in
the
mood
to
do
a
review
i
look
forward
to
next
year
when
i
will
by
this
beer
by
the
case
i
decided
to
try
this
one
because
it
was
an
imperial
the
only
thing
imperial
about
it
is
the
price
pass
this
one
by
it
fizzles
edit
this
is
leagues
better
on
tap
with
many
if
the
issues
resolved
maybe
they
changed
the
recipe
this
year
much
much
improved
overallcomments
a
very
tasty
and
flavor
packed
pumpkin
ale
that
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
very
nicely
done

as
a

if

this
is

just

i
had

will

next

overall
the

sip
is
appealing
but
the
finish
is
just
so
harsh
that
this
is
difficult
to
keep
drinking
this
is
one
that
to
me
isnt
worth
the
calories
o
so
this
is
two
years
old
i
had
some
from
the
same
batch
last
year
and
it
was
probably
perfect
at
that
age
two
years
is
too
much
back
then
this
wouldve
been
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
but
something
has
seemed
to
change
with
most
of
the
2013
weyerbacher
releases
not
as
flavorful

drop
in
complexity
they

pours

doesnt

some
spotting

is

the
aroma
is
very
pleasing
and
strong
and
is
of
pumpkin
and
spices
the
taste
is
actually
even
better
and
is
very
tasty
with
lots
of
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
perfect
carbonation
no
harsh
or
bad
aftertaste
either
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
weak
and
i
feel
the
beer
lacks
complexity
there
are
many
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
to
be
honest
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
anything
pumpkin
bread
pie
and
especially
beer
however
this
was
a
pleasant
12
oz
experience
that
i
would
like
to
repeat
it
was
a
tasty
transition
from
thanksgiving
to
christmas
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
delicious
holiday
homebrew
a
friend
of
mine
made
a
few
years
back
i
had
rated
this
previously
a
4
but
downgrading
it
slightly
on
precise
i
still
like
the
beer
but
have
had
better
since
my
original
review
on
the
whole
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
if
i
get
another
one
i
will
age
it
for
a
while
this
is
a
very
bad
beer
i
have
always
wanted
to
try
this
and
now
i
can
say
i
have
i
dont
review
often
but
i
just
felt
compelled
to
state
what
a
bad
beer
this
was
it
poured
a
nice
pumpkin
color
with
a
very
nice
white
head
the
smell
was
very
nice
i
thought
i
was
about
to
get
into
something
yummy
similar
to
schlaflys
pumpkin
that
nice
pumpkin
pie
caramelly
sweet
and
chewy
goodness
then
the
taste
hmmmm
defnite
pumpkin
pie
spice
too
much
for
sure
and
the
base
beer
it
was
as
if
someone
made
a
poor
representation
of
an
amber
that
was
too
weak
and
thin
decided
to
sour
it
gave
up
after
a
week
and
then
added
pumpkin
pie
spice
theres
also
an
underlying
nasty
bitterness
that
is
not
good
but
at
least
distracts
from
the
rest
of
the
nastiness
drain
pour
and
then
to
the
ten
fidy
thats
on
deck
update
while
its
not
soured
out
like
that
last
one
i
had
but
its
kinda
fallen
off
for
me
in
the
past
few
years
mild
alcohol
burn
plenty
of
spice
more
on
the
dry
side
too
overall
i
had
pretty
high
expectations
for
this
beer
and
i
have
to
say
i
feel
pretty
let
down
in
my
opinion
a
pumpkin
beer
needs
pumpkin
flavor
not
just
spice
and
this
just
doesnt
have
it
tastes
more
like
an
amber
ale
with
a
boatload
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
dark
brown
in
appearance
and
turns
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
smells
great
like
a
classic
pumpkin
pie
with
ginger
and
clove
the
beer
doesnt
live
up
to
the
smell
though
it
has
a
thin
watery
mouthfeel
and
a
big
spicy
profile
of
clove
nutmeg
and
ginger
that
overpowers
the
pumpkin
flavor
o
spicy
but
decent
its
got
some
good
flavors
the
spice
is
just
a
little
overwhelming
maple
mistress
is
supposed
to
be
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
but
tastes
like
a
maple
ale
dont
know
where
the
pumpkin
is
in
it
overall
a
smooth
drinking
brew
the
high
abv
sets
this
beer
toward
the
top
of
the
pumpkin
ale
list
in
that
regard
and
makes
it
an
interesting
pick
i
think
perhaps
this
could
be
improved
however
if
it
were
brewed
with
a
bit
more
pumpkin
to
cover
up
that
fact
of
the
high
abv
when
drinking
it
you
sure
know
it
is
8
i
did
enjoy
it
as
my
first
weyerbacher
brew
and
would
like
to
check
out
their
other
offerings
this
seemed
to
be
a
worthy
rival
to
schlafly
but
the
boozy
taste
and
feel
ruined
it
how
it
used
to
be
i
like
it
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
another
im
not
dissatisfied
but
it
makes
me
wish
for
pumking
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
a
runofthemill
pumpkin
beer
that
happens
to
be
8
abv
conclusion
luckily
the
high
alcohol
content
of
this
beer
made
me
forget
what
i
disliked
about
it
until
i
opened
another
later
it
does
have
a
decent
pumpkin
taste
when
you
get
past
the
strong
fruity
and
spiciness
of
it
it
simply
lacks
in
every
aspect
but
the
fact
that
itll
knock
you
on
your
ass
poured
a
nice
seared
pumpkin
color
brilliant
clearness
in
the
light
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
trails
of
white
the
nose
is
heavy
on
the
cinnamon
but
clove
and
nutmeg
is
also
found
in
the
bouquet
more
of
a
nuttiness
than
caramel
or
sugar
here
although
a
nice
sweet
gingerbread
undertone
comes
out
as
it
warms
very
smooth
although
i
wouldnt
mind
a
touch
more
body
overall
a
very
well
made
beer
overall
one
of
the
more
revolting
beers
i
have
had
yet
the
mouthwash
nose
is
overpowering
the
taste
is
neither
subtle
nor
nuanced
i
detect
no
pumpkin
only
very
loud
cinnamon
and
clove
with
some
underlying
malts
i
hope
never
to
have
it
again
o
this
is
in
my
top
five
list
of
pumpkin
ales
the
weyerbacker
imperial
pumpkin
surely
lives
up
to
the
credit
its
been
given
if
i
were
to
drink
only
one
pumpkin
beer
i
just
might
choose
this
one
it
has
a
nice
aroma
its
very
drinkable
complex
and
tasty
grab
a
four
pack
of
this
while
you
still
can
o
i
am
not
crazy
about
pumpkin
beers
in
general
so
this
should
be
taken
into
account
however
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
as
i
drank
it
lots
of
spice
and
sweet
like
a
pumpkin
pie
i
may
try
this
again
before
the
season
is
over
but
if
i
dont
it
wouldnt
make
me
sad
overall
lots
of
nice
flavors
starts
off
sweet
gets
a
little
bitter
gets
a
little
sweet
and
finishes
dry
pretty
complex
despite
the
watery
body
among
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
this
is
a
solid
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
the
flavors
and
spices
are
well
balanced
it
is
very
drinkable
considering
the
abv
i
am
left
thinking
this
beer
is
missing
something
but
not
sure
what
until
i
figure
that
out
i
will
enjoy
this
seasonal
beauty
i
recommend
you
do
the
same
cheers
overall
the
flavors
are
dominated
by
clove
cinnamon
vegetal
bitterness
and
spice
bitterness
toast
and
caramel
are
quickly
overpowered
after
a
few
sips
the
lingering
pumpkin
taste
is
pleasant
the
lingering
vegetal
bitterness
spice
bitterness
and
alcohol
are
unpleasant
each
sip
makes
me
less
eager
for
another
drinkability
i
gave
this
second
chance
in
a
few
days
and
a
year
later
i
like
the
brewer
they
make
a
great
imperial
stout
they
are
hit
or
miss
this
is
a
bit
like
a
liquor
or
an
after
dinner
beer
drink
its
the
kind
of
beer
in
a
craft
pack
that
i
try
to
give
away
overall
definitely
one
of
y
favorite
pumpkin
ales
like
drinking
pumpkin
bread
with
strong
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
and
a
balanced
and
thick
mouthfeel
absolutely
stunning
o
sometimes
beers
give
me
this
sense
of
a
setting
when
i
drink
them
i
know
this
is
a
pumpkin
beer
but
the
heavy
clove
flavor
gives
me
this
feeling
like
im
drinking
some
medieval
beer
in
a
castle
overall
i
was
on
the
fence
with
the
beer
on
the
positive
side
it
smelled
very
good
and
had
good
spice
flavor
on
the
negative
it
felt
very
weak
and
seemed
to
have
too
much
spice
when
compared
to
the
weak
body
and
lack
of
actual
beer
flavor
overall
very
enjoyable
beer
perhaps
a
bit
too
focused
on
the
secondary
flavors
definitely
a
good
seasonal
drink
would
consider
purchasing
again
i
remember
loving
this
beer
this
is
not
the
beer
i
loved
maybe
ive
changed
maybe
it
changed
but
its
just
not
gonna
work
out
bad
batch
just
doesnt
really
seem
that
pumpkiny
at
all
always
looking
forward
to
the
pumpkin
beers
did
not
pour
this
one
just
drank
from
the
bottle
so
the
nose
was
somewhat
diminished
but
still
there
was
no
question
about
the
amount
of
pumpkin
spices
in
here
the
taste
followed
the
nose
completely
lots
of
fall
spices
perhaps
more
than
i
like
this
is
what
i
have
seen
so
far
with
most
of
the
other
pumpkin
beers
this
one
did
have
the
body
to
go
along
with
the
spices
it
was
not
that
carbonated
and
i
was
able
to
enjoy
some
real
pumpkin
overall
this
is
a
terrific
pumpkin
offering
that
has
all
the
pumpkin
flavor
yet
still
tastes
like
a
beer
ive
had
other
pumpkin
beers
before
like
dogfish
heads
punkin
ale
which
is
great
but
this
one
had
some
truly
perceivable
pumpkin
taste
which
for
me
seem
to
come
up
after
a
chug
then
nice
deep
breath
emanating
from
just
under
the
tongue
this
taste
like
i
imagine
a
pumpkin
beer
would
in
my
mind
its
sweet
and
strong
but
no
alcohol
taste
whatsoever
a
little
bitter
at
the
end
but
that
serves
well
to
counteract
the
sweetness
well
its
relatively
malty
and
moderately
heavy
overall
quite
enjoyable
of
course
the
spices
are
well
represented
cinnamon
nutmeg
cardamom
i
drank
this
straight
from
the
bottle
with
the
updated
label
art
bottled

enjoyed
on

quite
a
festive
craft
brew
would
definitely
partake
again
o
this
one
gets
the
job
done
for
me
nothing
extraordinary
but
pretty
darn
good
o
this
is
an
adult
pumpkin
beverage
for
sure
i
really
like
the
roast
and
the
elevated
alcohol
that
swarms
around
the
spiced
pumpkin
base
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
a
little
to
much
but
overall
a
well
crafted
brew
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
so
far
looking
for
other
suggestions
that
would
be
a
better
alternative
this
is
an
interesting
seasonal
beer
by
weyerbacher
it
is
something
different
that
i
look
forward
to
i
will
buy
this
again
an
exceptional
pumpkin
ale
and
would
pair
extremely
well
with
pumpkin
pie
or
bread

very
well

with
only
a
light

noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
imperial
pumpkin
ale
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
pumpkin
and
spice
notes
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
one
glass
to
go
please
salud
pick
it
up
if
you
see
it
overall
it
is
great
fall
beer
i
enjoyed
the
beer
with
a
texas
style
smoked
brisket
which
seemed
to
pair
with
the
beer
very
well
overall
this
is
weak
and
not
impressive
too
watery
and
lacks
the
big
flavors
that
most
pumpkin
beers
have
no
balance
and
alcohol
comes
too
strong
no
reason
to
drink
this
one
again
o
with
all
of
the
pumpkin
ales
and
beers
out
there
today
this
one
definitely
stands
out
with
the
elite
of
the
crowd
its
subtle
yet
overflowing
with
pumpkin
although
i
really
wanted
it
to
taste
more
like
it
smelled
a
wonderful
beer
for
the
fall
months
overall
never
know
what
to
expect
w
appearance
but
id
think
an
ale
especially
a
pumpkin
would
be
lighter
in
color
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
the
highlight
i
really
enjoy
the
spices
and
pumpkin
but
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
by
smell
tastewise
this
is
better
than
last
yr
more
flavorful
overall
this
doesnt
do
much
for
me
there
are
a
lot
of
pumpkin
ales
out
there
and
i
know
that
being
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
this
needs
to
be
bold
and
strong
but
it
just
doesnt
quite
have
the
balance
that
it
needs
to
work
around
that
alcohol
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
for
the
price
its
not
something
ill
buy
again

overall
an

not
overly

a
good
brew
my
personal
favorite
of
all
of
the
pumpkin
beers
this
one
has
a
great
malt
base
as
a
baseline
to
the
pumpkin
and
spices
that
go
into
every
pumpkin
beer
imperial
pumpkin
would
seemingly
be
a
great
porter
or
stout
if
not
for
the
added
pumpkin
and
spice
this
beer
is
what
a
pumpkin
spice
ale
should
be
the
spice
and
pumpkin
are
just
icing
on
the
cake
poured
this
pumpkin
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
reddish
amber
color
produced
a
thin
white
head
poor
retention
and
it
left
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
heavy
amounts
of
pumpkin
spice
and
roasted
pumpkin
medium
in
body
there
was
a
foundation
of
caramel
malt
roasted
pumpkin
clove
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
alcohol
flavorful
ale
nicely
spiced
and
well
balanced
overall
this
is
a
pumpkin
beer
which
is
growing
on
me
i
feel
like
the
spicing
is
a
little
imbalanced
and
harsh
in
places
but
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
smooth
and
pleasing
pumpkin
experience
overall
very
delicious
pumpkin
style
beer
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
and
will
have
again
i
really
enjoyed
the
overall
presence
of
the
spices
and
balance
of
flavors
and
it

poured

the
appearance
is
a
deep
murky
amber
with
a
orange
hue
somewhat
dark
for
a
pumpkin
beer
minimal
head
and
no
lacing
the
nose
is
full
of
spices
and
fleshy
pumpkin
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
are
somewhat
subdued
but
the
cardamom
is
pretty
strong
and
seems
slightly
out
of
place
for
this
beer
the
taste
is
somewhat
absent
of
sweetness
and
is
full
of
spice
mainly
cinnamon
and
cardamom
on
the
flavor
but
it
seems
to
come
through
more
at
the
end
i
am
missing
any
malty
backbone
to
hold
up
to
all
of
the
spices
a
slight
squashyfleshy
pumpkin
character
comes
through
but
it
doesnt
add
much
character
to
the
brew
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
heavy
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
uninspired
pumpkin
beer
the
ingredients
are
there
but
they
dont
pop
and
there
seems
to
be
no
malt
backbone
to
elevate
all
of
the
flavors
this
is
a
fun
autumn
beer
not
much
else
to
say
i
did
not
think
this
was
a
great
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
out
of
balance
on
the
spices
seemed
a
bit
confusing
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
did
not
get
any
actual
pumpkin
flavor
more
like
a
halfhearted
pumpkin
pie
skimping
on
the
squash
thick
and
sweet
kind
of
clying
on
the
palate
with
a
long
aftertaste
would
not
look
for
again
o
this
is
what
i
think
pumpkin
ales
should
taste
like
its
like
comparing
dark
roast
to
light
roast
coffee
compared
to
most
other
pumpkin
ales
the
pumpkin
spices
linger
on
the
palate
and
are
much
more
pronounced
and
fresh
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
o
maybe
i
just
dislike
cardamon
but
this
is
one
wasnt
very
enjoyable
for
me
far
from
a
drain
pour
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
next
year
overall
one
of
my
top
5
pumpkin
ales
but
it
just
cant
beat
out
southern
tiers
pumking
its
still
an
awesome
ale
though
and
good
for
any
fall
occasion
this
beer
is
reaching
but
does
not
disappoint
the
pumpkin
is
held
back
with
that
perfect
balance
of
earthy
yet
wait
for
it
yep
its
still
a
good
beer
the
color
is
a
deep
clear
orange
with
seamless
legs
the
kind
of
legs
you
want
to
put
stockings
on
and
a
lamp
shade
maybe
introduce
a
black
light
bulb
for
effect
and
let
weyerbacher
do
its
thang
year
after
year
i
still
think
these
guys
have
crafted
a
well
rounded
waiting
for
xmas
with
a
buzz
on
type
of
beer
i
am
only
hoping
santa
can
crave
his
way
out
of
this
pumpkin
and
into
that
deep
freeze
with
which
we
survive
the
lesser
daylight
it
reminds
me
of
those
quick
days
that
burn
off
the
gray
faster
than
bolt
does
his
shirt
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
full
and
the
finish
is
medium
the
beer
is
great
i
feel
that
the
nose
is
so
much
better
than
the
taste
however
i
would
have
to
like
to
see
more
of
a
malt
complex
in
the
beer
at
times
the
beer
seemed
a
bit
thin
but
chewy
big
fan
easily
in
my
5
best
pumpkin
beers
this
pumpkin
ale
does
not
disappoint
packs
quite
a
pumpkiny
punch
great
balance
of
spicy
and
sweet
you
can
taste
all
the
different
spices
easy
smooth
medium
to
full
bodied
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
with
soft
carbonation
definitely
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
out
there
thanks
again
weyerbacher
overall
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
to
add
to
the
list
bitterness
is
higher
than
i
would
like
but
still
a
good
pumpkin
beer
o
id
get
this
pumpkin
ale
again
it
definitely
tastes
like
autumn
in
the
north
east
i
would
like
it
to
be
a
little
less
flat
but
not
a
deal
breaker
overall
ok
offering
average
pumpkin
ale
i
liked
this
pumpkin
ale
quite
a
bit
but
could
see
how
it
could
be
polarizing
if
you
dont
like
spices
you
likely
wont
like
this
overall
a
nicely
balanced
pumpkin
beer
especially
for
those
who
prefer
squashy
varieties
to
sweet
i
am
of
the
latter
not
the
former
i
definitely
prefer
pumpkin
beers
that
bring
more
sweetness
to
the
table
still
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
drink
i
thank
troy
for
this
one
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
that
i
didnt
have
before
id
probably
have
this
one
again
i
did
have
an
11
3
tipa
right
before
this
couldve
been
a
bit
off
my
game
as
well
o
not
the
greatest
weyerbacher
ive
had
but
i
have
not
had
that
many
since
they
are
so
pricey
regardless
for
the
season
this
is
a
must
try
and
is
among
the
top
harvest
beers
o
this
was
labeled
as
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
but
it
wasnt
over
the
top
pumpkin
it
was
a
beer
first
and
foremost
the
did
well
to
incorporate
all
of
the
flavors
associated
with
this
style
but
nothing
really
stood
out
a
solid
brew
but
nothing
spectacular
o
a
very
tasty
seasonal
ale
very
crisp
and
refreshing
on
a
coldrainy
autumn
evening
o
good
pumpkin
beer
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
this
season
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
its
definitely
not
sessionable
but
worth
the
purchase
o
and
i
thought
pumking
was
all
spices
too
much
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
not
enough
pumpkin
i
am
a
pumpkin
beer
junkie
every
year
i
try
and
sample
as
many
as
i
possibly
can
this
beer
is
outstanding
it
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
so
far
besides
great
lakes
pumpkin
ale
it
goes
down
very
smooth
for
a
8
beer
and
smells
and
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
with
whipped
cream
you
would
expect
a
lot
more
spice
for
a
beer
that
is
8
but
this
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
amazing
it
is
a
little
pricey
at
12
a
4
pack
but
worth
every
penny
o
not
really
the
most
sessionable
beer
i
have
ever
had
but
i
did
enjoy
it
i
liked
how
the
sweetness
was
not
the
focal
point
but
rather
the
warm
spices
most
of
the
top
tier
pumpkin
brews
pumking
in
particular
really
overload
that
sweetness
this
is
a
good
change
of
pace
decent
pumpkin
ive
certainly
had
worse
although
i
wish
the
spices
were
a
bit
more
restrained
on
this
one
and
more
natural
pumpkin
came
through
im
rating
this
beer
all
5s
because
i
think
it
is
absolutely
excellent
lots
of
flavor
lots
of
alcohol
and
probably
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
alongside
dog
fish
heads
punkin
ale
with
the
exception
that
both
are
different
and
not
totally
comparable
o
a
really
really
enjoyable
pumpkin
seasonal
i
would
have
liked
to
have
tasted
more
pumpkin
but
the
spice
is
quite
nice
i
think
it
could
stand
to
be
just
a
little
more
balanced
in
flavor
but
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
thats
great
for
fall
festivals
and
bonfires
poured
from
tap
into
tulip
at
gingerman
sono
pours
a
deep
orangey
brown
with
good
foamy
head
crazy
spice
aromas
with
your
typical
sweet
malts
flavor
of
pumpkin
pie
typical
cinnamon
nutmeg
some
vanilla
etc
just
overly
spiced
for
a
drink
but
good
for
pie
with
such
an
influx
of
pumpkin
brews
there
are
others
id
go
for
before
i
have
this
again
overall
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
with
a
not
too
overpowering
sweetness
and
nice
flavors
and
a
wonderful
aroma
overall
very
delicious
pumpkin
style
beer
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
a
friend
and
will
have
again
i
really
enjoyed
the
overall
presence
of
the
spices
and
balance
of
flavors
and
it
also
presented
a
nice
mash
of
pumpkin
this
is
honestly
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
to
date
even
better
then
the
dogfish
head
punkin
by
far
the
taste
isnt
a
surprise
as
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
really
come
out
well
theres
certainly
a
definite
pumpkin
taste
to
this
one
however
it
does
it
without
being
overly
sweet
which
i
think
some
pumpkin
beers
end
up
overdoing
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
mildly
sweet
after
all
but
far
from
syrupy
or
boozy
it
just
all
works
very
well
and
fans
of
pumpkin
beers
should
enjoy
this
one
o
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
especially
if
you
are
more
inclined
toward
the
spicier
ones
as
i
am
very
good
mix
of
flavors
without
drowning
out
the
pumpkin
very
pie
like
in
smell
and
flavor
definitely
one
of
my
top
three
pumpkin
beers
that
i
have
tried
to
date
overall
this
isnt
a
style
i
usually
buy
but
every
fall
i
tend
to
try
1
or
2
new
ones
i
think
this
one
is
a
bit
too
hearty
a
bit
too
boozy
and
a
bit
too
heavyhanded
on
a
few
of
the
spices
this
is
worth
a
try
but
i
wont
be
buying
anymore
drinkability
a
fantastic
imperial
pumpkin
beer
the
flavor
of
pumpkin
is
not
over
exaggerated
like
in
other
pumpkin
beers
weyerbacher
makes
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
i
try
this
one
yearly
and
always
want
to
come
back
for
more
ive
had
a
couple
pumpkin
ales
better
than
this
but
ive
had
more
that
arent
nearly
as
good
it
contains
its
strength
well
and
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
this
is
a
really
nice
pumpkin
beer
its
full
of
all
the
usual
pumpkin
and
spice
aromas
and
flavors
plus
a
nice
amount
of
malt
its
also
extraordinarily
drinkable
for
8
abv
there
was
barely
any
throatwarming
theres
nothing
earthshattering
here
its
just
a
solid
fall
beer
nicely
done
weyerbacher
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
true
to
the
taste
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
it
is
ridiculous
how
many
pumpkin
beers
pop
up
on
the
shelves
this
time
of
year
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
few
that
is
worthwhile
the
pumpkin
flavor
works
well
without
tasting
artificial
and
the
spices
are
mellow
i
would
like
a
bit
more
body
but
overall
not
too
much
wrong
with
this
one
i
recommend
it
in
lieu
of
many
others
in
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
dark
redamber
with
no
haze
and
a
dense
foamy
tan
head
unfortunately
the
head
does
fall
flat
quickly
once
drinking
ensues
and
doesnt
provide
much
lacing
past
the
first
minute
the
nose
is
well
spiced
with
semibold
nutmegclove
and
there
is
a
bite
from
the
alcohol
its
not
a
particularly
sweet
smelling
beer
but
some
notes
of
caramelized
sugars
do
present
themselves
the
taste
is
malty
spicy
and
damn
well
balanced
this
is
a
very
drinkable
wellattenuated
adequately
spiced
beer
and
it
would
probably
pair
well
with
just
about
every
seasonal
meal
i
could
think
of
definitely
a
beer
ill
keep
in
mind
during
the
fall
season
and
i
will
likely
visit
it
again
o
perhaps
the
most
aromatic
of
the
pumpkin
beers
i
have
tried
but
it
does
fall
down
on
the
flavor
good
enough
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
but
the
depth
of
flavor
simply
isnt
there
and
we
are
after
all
ultimately
drinking
not
smelling
beer
even
for
a
pumpkin
brew
i
am
not
feeling
this
doesnt
really
do
it
and
is
actually
quite
disappointing
for
me
o
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
these
types
of
beer
but
its
brewed
about
an
hour
and
a
half
away
from
my
house
and
everyone
raves
about
it
this
time
of
year
if
your
a
fan
of
spicy
beers
andor
pumpkin
pie
this
def
wont
disappoint
o
again
really
just
too
much
spice
to
be
enjoyed
on
any
decent
basis
the
cinnamon
especially
is
way
too
over
the
top
and
there
are
too
many
spices
in
there
to
have
it
make
any
sense
palatewise
if
you
dont
like
spices
in
your
beer
be
sure
to
stay
clear
of
this
one
rich
in
pumpkin
flavor
right
away
with
background
notes
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
allspice
to
support
it
caramel
on
the
backend
and
just
enough
bitterness
to
make
it
not
too
sweet
it
has
a
fine
pretty
much
smooth
mouthfeel
with
lower
carbonation
levels
and
a
medium
body
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
entirely
pleasurable
o
saw
it
and
picked
it
up
not
really
knowing
what
to
expect
but
having
a
good
idea
of
what
i
wanted
and
this
wasnt
it
not
bad
overall
though
good
everything
solid
pumpkin
ale
nutmeg
clove
warm
pumpkinspice
allspice
the
usual
suspects
great
big
brown
character
sweet
brown
sugar
and
butter
mild
banana
notes
all
this
tied
up
in
the
nose
and
taste
very
little
hopping
just
enough
to
act
as
a
bittering
agent
not
big
in
the
flavor
though
moderate
mouthfeel
little
smaller
than
8
should
feel
good
work
i
might
pair
it
with
something
later
maybe
some
roasted
root
vegetables
this
is
medium
bodied
with
sharp
carbonation
this
one
isnt
bad
for
those
who
love
spice
bombs
there
definitely
is
some
spice
but
for
a
pumpkin
beer
its
not
an
overwhelming
pumpkin
taste
the
spice
smell
is
there
and
there
is
a
faint
aroma
of
pumpkin
when
you
first
smell
it
it
tastes
like
fall
and
it
is
good
but
the
pumpkin
taste
is
a
bit
disappointing
light
half
a
finger
head
of
tan
color
which
evaporates
down
very
quickly
to
an
almost
foamless
surface
likewise
the
lacing
is
nonexistent
copper
orange
colored
liquid
a
few
trace
bubbles
zip
about
yellows
around
the
rims
pleasing
overall
clarity
given
the
richness
of
its
pungency
the
nose
has
a
stiff
texture
and
feel
plenty
of
pumpkin
there
more
so
cinnamon
clove
spice
and
something
reminiscent
of
cola
also
some
lemon
citrus
and
well
baked
pie
crust
notes
rises
deep
into
your
nostrils
and
stays
there
for
some
time
mediumbodied
equally
firm
feel
here
in
the
mouth
the
carbonation
more
muscular
than
expected
based
on
visual
inspection
mixes
some
milk
chocolate
into
those
baking
spices
sort
of
softens
things
a
touch
the
pumpkin
is
strong
without
being
really
sweet
biscuit
scone
with
a
moment
of
cornbread
here
theres
a
stronger
honeyed
aspect
the
floral
dimension
expands
through
the
finish
extending
things
further
the
level
of
spicing
is
pretty
outrageous
so
if
you
want
lowkey
or
demure
this
is
not
for
you
otherwise
get
ready
for
a
spice
fest
o
this
is
a
very
good
and
very
enjoyable
pumpkin
beer
that
is
looking
for
a
beer
that
has
the
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
but
doesnt
taste
like
a
pumpkin
pie
i
only
wish
the
alcohol
was
a
little
more
well
hidden
though
i
found
that
it
was
not
as
present
in
the
bottled
version
final
thoughts
im
currently
brewing
a
pumpkin
ale
and
i
hope
it
turns
out
like
this
one
the
spices
are
at
a
great
level
and
the
pumpkin
flavor
really
shines
a
likable
beer
that
ill
probably
buy
again
when
it
starts
getting
colder
outside
there
is
some
nice
flavor
to
be
had
once
you
start
sipping
but
the
flavors
are
just
here
and
there
it
doesnt
come
together
well
this
beer
pours
a
medium
bodied
deep
polished
cherry
wood
auburn
in
color
with
no
head
at
all
and
moderate
carbonation
the
nose
is
super
spicy
and
a
cardamom
bomb
there
is
also
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
but
wowzers
is
there
too
much
cardamom
the
flavors
too
are
dominated
by
cardamom
it
has
the
typical
characteristics
of
cinnamon
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
but
the
spicing
is
pretty
over
the
top
it
definitely
takes
away
from
the
overall
product
i
just
cant
get
behind
this
one
it
doesnt
have
the
balance
that
a
beer
of
this
style
needs
o
this
one
caught
me
off
guard
i
bought
it
out
of
sheer
curiosity
and
came
away
impressed
if
i
ever
felt
like
having
a
pumpkin
ale
again
id
go
for
this
in
a
heartbeat
oda
gutsy
pumpkin
brew
assertive
good
flavors
but
a
bit
too
coarse
i
prefer
southern
tiers
pumpking
but
this
lies
in
the
same
echelon
o
i
expected
better
there
are
definitely
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
but
i
think
the
idea
of
an
8
abv
pumpkin
ale
looks
better
on
paper
than
it
turns
out
when
actualized
theres
not
much
room
for
the
kind
of
subtlety
that
is
required
of
the
style
when
you
beef
up
a
beer
so
much
and
i
still
think
some
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
are
also
very
sessionable
for
a
reason
o
4
0
ive
never
liked
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
is
good
i
can
never
taste
anything
but
spice
and
its
always
too
much
this
one
actually
has
faint
undertones
of
actual
pumpkin
taste
and
the
spices
are
tastefully
subtle
instead
it
relies
on
more
of
caramelly
brown
sugar
core
and
something
of
the
personality
of
a
brown
ale
its
very
nice
i
usually
dont
even
want
to
drink
half
of
a
pumpkin
beer
i
start
but
ill
enjoy
several
of
these
this
week
recommended
to
any
pumpkin
ale
fan
o
definitely
from
a
different
mold
than
most
pumpkin
beers
but
for
me
that
makes
it
enjoyable
youre
not
bombarded
with
often
fake
spiciness
and
cloying
sweetness
what
you
do
get
is
rich
pumpkin
flavor
with
a
hint
of
spice
just
like
a
good
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
well
done
o
decent
execution
for
a
spicepumpkin
beer
low
carbonation
was
just
right
but
brewery
delivered
fairly
well
on
the
big
spice
flavors
would
have
appreciated
heavier
lownotes
and
a
little
more
syrup
in
the
mouth
feel
imperial
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
very
little
the
aroma
has
a
strong
note
of
pumpkin
and
is
creamy
the
taste
has
a
nice
bitter
undertone
with
hints
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
it
blends
very
nicely
very
nice
flavors
blends
good
still
has
a
beer
taste
overall
a
fantastic
pumpkin
beer
up
there
with
the
best
heavily
reliant
on
the
spices
and
very
herbaceous
this
year
the
8
abv
is
covered
well
as
always
overall
my
first
pumpin
beer
and
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
i
am
quite
disappointed
was
expecting
more
pumpkin
flavor
and
spice
excited
to
see
what
other
in
the
style
have
to
offer
this
fall
and
happy
i
got
this
one
out
of
the
way
with
a
single
now
maybe
i
just
dont
get
the
style
yet

original
review
on

overall
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
maybe
a
bit
strong
for
those
not
expecting
it
pours
a
dark
black
with
little
to
no
head
smells
like
pumpkin
with
an
array
of
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
ginger
tastes
almost
like
a
pumpkin
pie
with
the
high
alcohol
content
apparent
in
the
finish
for
its
dark
color
its
surprisingly
thinbodied
overall
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
as
i
have
yet
to
find
one
thats
comparable
a
great
fall
beer
and
good
transition
from
the
blondes
and
wheats
of
summer
to
the
malty
spicy
winter
brews
doverall
this
was
a
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
and
its
8
which
it
higher
than
most
pumpkin
ales
i
thought
the
flavors
and
aromas
really
were
a
home
run
in
this
beer
i
would
def
pick
this
up
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
it
rates
up
there
with
dfh
pumpkin
ale
i
think
i
might
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
tasting
next
year
to
see
which
i
like
better
o
much
more
pumpkin
spice
than
actual
pumpkin
flesh
nevertheless
this
beer
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
because
it
always
reminds
me
of
a
nice
pumpkin
pie
the
8
abv
doest
hurt
either
also
this
beer
is
very
consistent
from
year
to
year
12
oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
murky
dark
orange
with
a
one
finger
head
that
fell
quickly
with
little
to
no
lacing
aroma
is
heavy
of
the
pumpkin
and
what
can
best
be
described
as
mulling
spices
its
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
and
very
creamy
almost
like
pumpkin
pie
the
kick
of
spice
is
a
pleasant
surprise
compared
to
some
more
overly
sweet
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
definitely
one
of
the
top
contenders
in
this
heavily
populated
seasonal
style
overall
im
still
happy
with
this
beer
its
a
wellcrafted
pumpkin
ale
and
given
the
opportunity
id
recommend
everyone
give
the
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
a
chance
however
im
still
looking
forward
to
a
few
of
the
other
pumpkin
beers
coming
soon
this
may
be
the
queen
of
pumpkin
beers
but
im
looking
for
the
king
o
pretty
impressive
but
doesnt
make
it
into
my
list
of
top
3
pumpkin
beers
the
fact
that
it
hardly
tastes
like
pumpkin
has
a
lot
to
do
with
that
overall
i
would
buy
again
but
just
seasonal
once
in
a
while
is
nice
thanks
once
again
weyerbacher
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
next
fall
o
delicious
fresh
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
taste
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
brews
around
do
pretty
solid
pumpkin
offering
from
weyerbacher
nothing
amazing
but
worth
a
shot
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
thanks
for
the
try
at
an
out
of
distroed
brewery
ruizjoseph
pours
deep
orange
closer
to
amber
brown
frothy
2
finger
head
of
lasting
presence
great
sweet
and
spicy
aroma
brown
sugar
pumpkin
spice
cinnamon
not
getting
any
clove
notes
as
stated
but
definitely
getting
nutmeg
perhaps
too
much
of
it
not
bad
slightly
above
avg
but
not
a
memorable
favorite
would
still
retry
it
next
year
medium
bodied
and
lots
of
carbonation
you
can
taste
the
pumpkin
cinnamon
cardamom
and
cloves
however
i
dont
pick
up
the
nutmeg
in
the
flavor
sweet
upfront
with
pumpkin
and
cardamom
cloves
and
more
cardamom
in
the
middle
a
slightly
sweet
finish
with
cinnamon
and
peaches
very
nice
the
8
0
abv
is
well
hidden
among
the
sweet
pumpkin
spices
this
is
a
decent
beer
the
flavor
is
good
but
mild
unfortunately
there
are
better
pumpkins
on
the
market
each
fall
so
i
probably
wont
seek
this
one
out
again
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
is
a
crystal
clear
amber
ale
with
a
generous
creamy
yellowish
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
thick
and
spicy
with
clove
at
the
forefront
its
quite
full
bodied
and
very
smooth
with
a
clean
quick
finish
it
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
slick
after
a
few
sips
it
tastes
bold
and
flavorful
there
isnt
much
bitterness
and
it
sits
between
sweet
and
dry
the
cardamom
and
clove
kind
of
give
it
a
chai
flavor
i
can
taste
the
pumpkin
right
before
the
finish
its
kind
of
exotic
tasting
this
is
a
stand
out
pumpkin
ale
the
cardamom
really
sets
it
apart
its
like
a
pumpkin
spiced
chai
latte
beer
love
it
o
good
big
pumpkin
ale
feels
thicker
than
you
would
expect
its
almost
syrupy
overall
impression
what
a
pumpkin
the
sweetness
and
spice
were
just
perfect
adding
to
the
richness
of
a
true
pumpkin
pie
flavor
enjoyed
this
one
til
every
last
drop
hit
my
tongue
and
can
throw
this
in
my
top
5
pumpkin
ales
without
a
doubt
thanks
a
ton
ipaking67
and
hope
you
enjoyed
those
schlafly
pumpkin
ales
which
are
1
on
my
list
and
the
saison
brett
poured
dark
amber
with
a
small
head
that
dissipated
quickly
leaving
no
lace
smell
was
a
rich
sugary
caramel
malt
with
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
taste
was
caramel
cinnamon
nutmeg
sweet
and
the
cardamom
mentioned
on
the
label
which
along
with
the
sweetness
gives
the
beer
a
slightly
chai
tea
taste
alcohol
was
noticeable
mouthfeel
was
too
light
overall
was
interesting
but
ive
had
better
pumpkin
ales
as
far
as
the
coloring
and
scent
it
has
a
deep
brownred
color
some
foamy
tan
head
a
bit
of
lacing
nice
spicey
scent
overall
an
extremely
satisfying
brew
that
had
all
the
flavors
blending
so
well
that
any
alcohol
presence
was
almost
non
existent
it
had
a
drinkability
that
was
so
appealing
that
it
left
you
wanting
more
overall
its
a
good
pumpkin
ale
but
not
a
great
one
i
read
a
bunch
of
reviews
that
say
good
to
try
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
well
duh
but
is
it
good
pumking
is
infectious
tasty
and
well
blended
this
one
lags
behind
it
needs
some
flavor
to
offset
the
spices
brew
yields
a
deep
garnet
hued
amber
color
with
a
frothy
almost
creamy
head
a
generous
aroma
of
fall
blended
dessert
fills
the
nose
with
notes
of
sugared
ginger
cookies
and
perhaps
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
with
only
a
slight
booziness
relative
to
other
pumpkin
beers
of
imperial
claim
that
ive
tried
maple
like
sweetness
joins
a
solid
pumpkin
flavor
in
the
malt
body
with
a
note
of
clove
and
an
herbal
finish
o
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
a
tad
to
boozy
and
a
touch
to
peppery
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
give
it
a
try
d
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
pumpkin
ale
weyerbacher
got
everything
right
here
its
tasty
highly
drinkable
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
o
good
but
not
an
excellent
pumpkin
ale
the
strength
doesnt
show
and
its
quite
drinkable
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
but
i
might
pick
one
up
next
year
d
a
rather
nice
strong
ale
given
a
seasonal
flair
by
some
spice
gourd
the
rich
melanoidan
toasty
nutty
roasty
malt
base
of
this
really
make
it
shine
way
too
easy
drinking
for
8
percent
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
i
had
this
year
i
remember
not
thinking
much
of
this
last
year
one
to
revisit
if
available
but
i
would
appreciate
weyerbacher
toning
down
the
alcohol
a
notch
im
not
sure
how
much
this
benefits
by
a
heightened
ethanol
content
and
the
noticeable
scent
and
burn
arent
particularly
pleasant
taste
was
exceptional
perfect
mix
of
malt
spice
and
booze
a
serious
seasonal
ale
not
some
pumpkin
pielike
swill
last
year
i
was
on
a
pumpkin
ale
quest
and
tasted
many
the
weyerbacher
was
my
favorite
and
sold
out
pretty
quickly
here
i
was
glad
to
see
its
return
this
season
of
course
at
12
bucks
a
12
oz
four
pack
you
may
think
twice
however
you
get
what
you
pay
for
o
nice
seasonal
beer
first
weyerbacher
beer
that
i
try
not
a
complete
pumpkin
ale
for
me
but
i
could
get
it
again
the
flavors
are
there
you
can
notice
right
away
without
problem
nice
beer
to
pair
with
chicken
tacos
eh
not
bad
but
far
from
great
copper
orange
with
a
reddish
hue
and
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
dense
foamy
head
that
leaves
random
lacings
on
the
glass
sweet
pumpkin
and
spicy
aromas
spicy
aromas
are
delicate
enough
to
allow
the
pumpkin
sweetness
to
dominate
buttery
smooth
feel
with
the
carbonation
and
maltiness
combining
to
provide
a
thick
chewy
texture
sweet
pumpkin
flavor
up
front
and
into
the
middle
spices
kickin
thru
the
middle
and
slowy
intensify
to
the
finish
spices
are
delicate
enough
so
as
not
to
overwhelm
the
sweet
pumpkin
maltiness
and
nicely
subdue
an
underlying
booziness
finishes
with
a
lingering
but
light
spicy
aftertaste
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
cheers
high
abv
kind
of
a
pumpkin
tripel
but
otherwise
rather
average
quality
pumpkin
ale
o
my
number
3
all
time
pumpkin
beer
a
must
buy
and
this
one
doesnt
have
a
cult
following
like
schlafly
and
s
t
pumking
so
you
can
be
sure
to
have
it
at
a
total
wine
or
other
major
beer
super
store
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pack
some
up
for
the
cold
fridged
january
nights
when
you
hopefully
are
near
a
nice
roasting
fire
this
beer
will
serve
me
well
this
winter
season
shit
i
will
bring
some
with
me
when
i
go
boarding
soon
ha
overall
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
very
bold
with
the
spices
and
malts
could
of
had
a
little
more
actual
pumpkin
flavor
but
whats
there
is
very
good
o
quite
nice
overall
especially
the
nose
i
just
wish
there
were
a
bit
more
pumpkin
and
less
spice
the
alcohol
is
deceptively
high
in
this
as
i
couldnt
feel
it
in
the
taste
and
barely
noticed
a
boozy
sensation
after
i
worked
my
way
through
the
contents
of
my
pint
glass
in
the
past
i
wasnt
so
much
a
fan
of
this
style
but
its
a
beer
like
this
that
can
change
my
mind
this
was
an
unexpected
surprise
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
and
cant
wait
to
try
again
and
its
beers
like
this
that
make
this
season
so
enjoyable
overall
flavors
and
spiciness
remind
me
of
yards
tavern
spruce
which
gives
me
a
sense
that
the
spice
content
is
quite
high
overall
not
my
favorite
type
of
pumpkin
one
of
the
more
spicy
overall
the
taste
can
be
too
much
to
handle
but
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
the
smell
alone
is
wellworth
the
price
of
admission
onice
ber
but
i
wish
it
followed
the
nose
more
ooverall
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
brew
nice
combo
or
pumpkin
and
spice
surprisingly
drinkable
for
8
abv
not
as
good
as
southern
tiers
pumking
but
good
nonetheless
although
the
limited
woodchuck
private
reserve
pumpkin
cider
sounds
delighful
o
its
a
wonderful
fall
pumpkin
beer
just
went
to
the
top
of
my
list
overall
overall
a
very
decent
example
of
the
style
could
use
a
bit
more
maltiness
andor
body
to
prevent
the
alcohol
from
being
a
bit
overpowering
the
aroma
though
is
phenomenal
definitely
reminds
me
of
the
fall
o
very
good
pumpkin
ale
and
ill
have
it
again
would
love
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
some
other
pumpkins
but
ill
save
that
for
fresh
batches
next
year
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
i
didt
care
for
the
combination
of
cardamom
and
cloves
o
my
favorite
pumpkin
offering
so
far
this
one
and
the
post
road
would
be
good
head
to
head
i
like
the
smell
and
the
taste
of
this
one
better
after
it
sits
for
a
bit
it
starts
to
get
a
little
bit
bitter
but
it
just
blends
in
with
the
spices
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
for
a
pumpkin
ale
to
try
tried
this
at
a
bocktown
beer
and
grill
its
wonderful
pumpkin
pie
flavor
mixed
nicely
with
the
caramel
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
our
server
had
dipped
the
rim
of
the
pint
glass
in
brown
sugar
while
i
havent
had
many
pumpkin
ales
todate
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
ale
ranks
extremely
high
when
compared
with
any
type
of
beer
i
was
super
impressed
o
a
solid
pumpkin
brew
id
definitely
have
another
the
appearance
of
this
pumpkin
ale
is
amber
and
orange
with
a
small
offwhite
head
its
nose
is
nutmeg
cinnamon
clove
very
nice
indeed
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
a
bit
bitter
some
pumpkin
along
with
more
of
those
nice
spices
and
sweetness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
crisp
texture
it
drinks
fairly
easily
all
in
all
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
while
it
has
a
stronger
spice
than
some
of
the
basic
pumpkin
ales
it
is
not
overdone
as
some
others
are
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
o
just
too
sweet
for
my
liking
but
may
be
worth
a
buy
for
the
smell
alone
medium
bodies
wth
good
carbonation
overall
not
bad
here
a
solid
pumpkin
brew
a
nice
beer
with
subtle
spicing
it
is
not
too
carbonated
and
there
is
no
bitter
after
taste
much
more
body
than
shipyard
pumpkin
after
notes
of
sweetness
like
a
belgian
i
like
the
color
not
too
clear
and
red
tones
make
it
look
nice
in
the
glass
minimal
head
o
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
would
love
some
more
of
this
for
sure
havent
had
some
of
the
higher
rated
pumpkin
beers
but
would
love
to
try
them
if
they
are
better
than
this
d
for
an
imperial
pumpkin
this
is
easy
to
drink
a
very
festive
offering
from
weyerbacher
o
overall
a
good
brew
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
weyerbacher
impresses
all
the
time
o
i
thought
i
was
in
for
a
treat
based
off
of
the
appearance
and
smell
of
this
brew
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
let
me
down
slightly
thats
not
to
say
this
isnt
a
good
pumpkin
beer
it
most
certainly
is
but
it
isnt
the
most
focused
i
have
had
and
its
definitely
a
little
overspiced
could
have
used
a
touch
more
malt
to
level
things
out
a
touch
all
the
same
i
love
me
some
pumpkin
beers
and
this
one
is
enjoyable
weyerbacher
continues
to
produce
some
of
the
finest
brew
in
the
country
if
you
see
it
grab
it
overall
a
great
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
a
good
deal
of
pumpkin
taste
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
i
still
like
dfh
punkn
better
but
this
is
also
very
good
hazy
orange
in
color
with
a
thin
head
that
disappears
quickly
aroma
is
malty
with
the
prerequisite
pumpkin
spices
in
a
nice
blend
spices
come
heavily
in
the
tastenutmeg
cinnamon
and
the
pumpkin
later
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
at
this
percentage
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
but
definitely
a
good
example
of
one
with
more
alcohol
overall
awesome
beer
for
the
season
its
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
not
super
rich
definitely
pumpkiny
and
not
just
pumpkin
pie
spice
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
everything
about
it
works
together
really
well
and
while
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
present
and
potent
its
complemented
well
by
the
rest
of
the
beer
a
winner
overall
this
was
my
first
imperial
pumpkin
ale
i
was
expecting
an
overwhelming
alcohol
flavor
as
i
thought
the
pumpkin
wouldnt
quite
override
it
but
it
covered
it
well
o
despite
the
little
bit
of
anise
which
im
not
the
hugest
fan
of
this
was
still
pretty
solid
o
to
date
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
be
prepared
for
a
lot
of
spices
but
it
has
a
nice
earthy
pumpkin
characteristic
to
it
as
well
if
you
arent
a
fan
of
cinnamon
id
stay
away
otherwise
this
is
a
beer
id
recommend
to
any
craft
drinker
o
very
spicyfall
like
really
enjoy
this
and
at
a
drinkable
8
im
quite
happy
with
it
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
the
aftertaste
has
a
lot
of
cinnamon
a
nice
beer
from
weyerbacher
o
of
the
pumpkins
ive
had
this
one
is
pretty
middle
of
the
road
overall
the
age
did
this
beer
well
fresh
i
think
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
bitter
the
time
smoothed
things
out
nicely
o
i
hope
that
this
batch
or
bottle
was
just
no
good
all
the
complexity
i
had
hoped
for
was
dashed
it
was
just
this
side
of
a
drain
pour
ill
try
another
bottle
as
weyerbacher
in
general
usually
brews
something
i
like
very
nice
bold
flavors
without
giving
me
diabetes
cough
southern
tier
enjoyed
it
at
dfhs
punkin
level
for
me
this
is
one
of
my
favorate
pumpkin
beers
if
not
my
favorate
of
them
all
this
pumpkin
ale
has
a
great
smell
color
and
taste
definitely
can
taste
the
pumpkin
and
spice
and
with
this
being
an
imperial
it
only
takes
a
few
to
get
into
the
fall
spirit
poured
an
ambercopper
with
a
moderate
film
being
left
behind
and
a
fairly
thick
collar
loads
of
spices
in
the
nose
with
a
weird
burnt
rubberleather
note
coming
through
at
times
admittedly
only
once
or
twice
throughout
the
entire
glass
some
pumpkin
pie
notes
taste
has
some
pumpkin
spices
reflective
of
the
nose
nutmeg
allspice
presumably
and
a
bit
of
breadiness
medium
body
and
carbonation
great
flavour
with
a
somewhat
weird
nose
at
moments
pleasant
but
not
totally
satisfying
overall
this
is
probably
just
behind
the
schlafly
and
a
step
below
the
pumking
its
a
heavily
spiced
beer
but
there
is
enough
malt
presence
in
there
to
keep
it
drinkable
even
if
you
are
not
into
spice
bombs
i
myself
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
and
am
glad
that
i
have
23
more
bottles
of
it
to
carry
me
through
the
fall
i
liked
this
one
more
than
my
drinking
mates
definitely
different
than
other
pumpkin
ales
i
feel
the
aroma
and
mouthfeel
are
the
best
aspects
of
the
beer
taste
is
a
bit
lopsided
and
overly
spiced
good
definitely
worth
trying
if
youre
into
the
style
the
smooth
easy
drinking
character
of
this
beer
makes
it
go
down
quickly
if
not
for
the
heavy
hand
with
the
spices
you
might
get
in
trouble
here
o
the
only
saving
grace
for
this
beer
is
that
it
sports
an
abv
of
8
0
i
shouldnt
have
preceded
this
tasting
with
a
southern
tier
pumpking
httpbeeradvocate
combeerprofile381838394
a
good
drinking
beer
even
with
in
my
opinion
it
being
weak
in
flavor
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
dark
rich
auburnruby
coloring
with
no
head
deeply
spicy
nose
with
heavy
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
characters
as
well
as
a
bready
quality
flavor
is
dark
molasses
and
pumpkin
rich
with
a
light
spicing
and
slightly
boozey
character
the
aftertaste
is
rich
and
smokey
with
a
slick
oily
finish
decent
brew
and
a
bit
darker
and
heftier
than
most
pumpkin
offerings
there
is
a
chewy
malt
bill
that
accompanies
the
spices
with
all
the
attendant
spice
this
was
like
a
cross
between
a
witbier
and
a
pumpkin
ale
good
stuff
recommended
probably
a
bit
short
of
a
killer
pumpkin
ale
but
good
nonetheless
fall
is
finally
here
and
i
am
glad
to
finally
have
this
beer
again
o
b
rated
beer
overall
im
giving
an
unbiased
rating
i
truly
like
everything
weyerbacher
does
as
they
are
a
fave
brewery
it
is
a
great
and
easy
to
drink
pumpkin
ale
oone
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
out
there
this
was
the
unanimous
second
place
to
pumking
i
would
rank
this
just
underneath
st
pumking
and
williamsburg
on
my
list
of
alltime
pumpkin
ale
favorites
overall
a
great
mouthfeel
can
go
a
long
way
with
a
beer
as
can
good
hop
flavor
the
spices
here
are
definitely
overboard
and
theres
no
pumpkin
flavor
whatsoever
but
the
satisfying
feel
and
perfectly
matched
hops
save
the
day
i
could
happily
kill
all
or
most
of
a
4
pack
of
these
at
some
autumn
gathering
overall
pretty
tasty
pumpkin
brew
the
bottle
says
it
all
when
it
comes
to
the
taste
and
aroma
of
this
beer
the
pumpkin
and
spices
cinnamon
cardamom
clove
are
there
in
force
but
do
not
come
off
as
overwrought
or
artificial
it
smells
like
the
real
thing
the
flavors
all
carry
over
onto
the
palate
with
layers
and
layers
of
spice
and
pumpkin
the
cinnamon
is
particularly
pronounced
this
is
not
a
style
that
i
personally
love
but
it
is
very
well
done
and
very
drinkable
because
there
is
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
that
keeps
the
beer
lively
it
also
hides
the
alcohol
well
which
with
all
of
the
added
flavor
was
helpful
in
keeping
the
beer
from
being
too
heavy
this
pumpkin
is
a
wonderful
example
of
a
beer
that
has
a
great
nose
and
a
similar
taste
when
you
smell
this
beer
it
makes
you
think
of
pumpkin
pie
with
a
good
pour
you
can
have
a
nice
frothy
head
it
does
dissipate
quickly
but
it
releases
all
of
the
awesomeness
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
does
not
overwhelm
the
palate
i
find
that
this
beer
ages
very
well
and
give
you
a
nice
warming
sensation
during
those
cold
winter
months
this
is
one
my
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
which
can
be
enjoyed
year
round
had
i
not
tried
pumking
i
may
have
thought
this
was
the
best
pumpkin
ale
it
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
can
buy
locally
however
it
certainly
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
packs
a
punch
the
color
is
a
deep
brownishred
with
about
an
inch
of
a
head
with
a
vigorous
pour
receding
to
little
to
no
head
there
is
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
nice
dominated
by
vanilla
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
alcohol
content
is
prevalent
immediately
after
the
first
sip
like
i
said
this
is
good
for
when
you
want
a
beer
with
a
decent
kick
the
flavor
is
not
as
tasty
as
the
nose
suggests
if
they
could
tone
down
the
booze
and
increase
the
complexity
of
the
spice
flavor
i
would
rate
this
higher
o
too
much
spice
and
not
nearly
enough
pumpkin
for
the
style
o
the
head
was
lacking
on
this
beer
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
nose
and
flavor
it
was
so
smooth
too
i
liked
this
beer
better
than
the
dogfish
head
go
get
it
o
3
5
poured
a
thick
head
half
inch
but
it
faded
pretty
quickly
smelled
great
perfect
combo
of
spices
and
pumpkin
tasted
pretty
spicy
tough
to
pick
out
the
pumpkin
i
let
it
get
closer
to
room
temperature
it
was
really
cold
and
the
pumpkin
flavor
came
out
more
8
oz
was
enough
for
me
though
it
got
pretty
sweet
by
the
end
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
pumpkin
ales
but
this
was
right
up
there
with
any
of
them
overall
have
i
mentioned
that
theres
too
much
clove
or
cinnamon
or
whatever
that
is
overpowering
its
easy
enough
to
drink
and
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
bad
but
where
are
the
other
flavors
o
for
me
id
prefer
something
that
tastes
a
little
less
like
a
beer
and
more
like
a
treat
in
some
ways
this
beer
reminded
me
of
something
from
unibroue
i
cant
recall
which
brew
so
not
to
sound
negative
let
me
just
say
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
didnt
taste
the
sweet
pumpkininess
as
much
as
i
may
have
liked
and
with
imperial
in
the
name
i
expected
something
richer
in
taste
and
smell
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
easily
have
a
few
glasses
of
this
it
is
definitely
a
perfect
beer
for
the
fall
season
it
really
has
a
festive
taste
to
it
i
like
that
the
vanilla
stands
out
a
little
bit
more
than
in
other
pumpkin
beers
that
ive
had
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
good
pumpkin
beer
and
a
must
try
for
pumpkin
beer
fans
i
would
definitely
pick
up
more
of
this
o
not
a
bad
seasonal
pumpkin
beer
but
certainly
not
the
best
ive
had
if
you
couldnt
smell
the
beer
youd
think
it
was
just
an
overcarbonated
english
ale
into
which
someone
dumped
some
cinnamon
it
is
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
for
an
8
abv
beer
glad
i
tried
it
but
not
on
my
top
three
list
for
pumpkin
seasonals
o
quite
enjoyable
and
recommended
among
the
style
overall
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
to
date
nice
bold
spices
and
pumpkin
very
good
mouthfeel
and
nice
orangeclove
aftertaste
this
was
a
fairly
expensive
beer
124pack
and
unfortunately
is
disappointing
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
i
will
sit
on
a
bit
and
see
how
it
is
in
a
month
or
two
if
its
any
better
ill
revise
o
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
but
seems
to
be
lacking
a
little
something
maybe
a
bit
more
hops
would
jazz
it
up
the
overall
flavor
is
still
nice
but
i
felt
like
it
could
have
been
better
o
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
top
5
pumpkin
brews
lots
of
actual
pumpkin
a
little
too
much
spice
perhaps
especially
in
the
nose
but
over
all
very
well
done
i
wanna
grab
some
of
this
and
see
how
it
mellows
out
by
thanksgiving
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
creamy
head
and
beautiful
honeycomb
lacing
along
the
edges
nose
is
soft
meaty
pumpkin
pie
with
nutmeg
and
a
soft
floral
quality
mouth
opens
with
a
touch
of
pumpkin
meat
and
sugars
segues
into
a
lightly
spicy
finish
with
gobs
of
pumpkin
meat
just
dry
enough
but
genuine
and
pleasantly
robust
throughout
hops
are
minimal
and
act
to
compliment
the
pumpkin
flavors
into
a
kind
of
crusty
flavor
some
slight
lingering
off
flavors
on
the
finish
but
thats
pretty
much
my
only
knock
on
this
soft
in
the
mouth
creamy
almost
perfect
very
good
probably
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
the
beer
is
fairly
hazy
and
sunset
orange
colored
with
a
small
white
cap
that
leaves
some
sparse
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
is
heavily
spiced
with
nutmeg
cinnamon
pumpkin
sweet
potato
brown
sugar
theres
no
mistaking
this
brew
tis
autumn
the
flavor
while
also
heavily
spiced
offers
more
balance
and
distinction
of
flavors
than
the
aroma
would
have
led
me
to
believe
a
tasty
malt
backbone
supports
the
various
fall
spices
alcohol
content
is
hidden
well
overall
a
tasty
pumpkin
beer
while
one
in
a
session
is
plenty
i
would
certainly
have
this
again
finally
going
to
review
a
beer
bought
from
beer
heaven
on
columbus
blvd
poured
from
bottle
into
a
snifter
beer
has
a
dark
reddish
color
two
it
with
very
nice
head
and
retention
spices
are
what
primarily
come
through
on
the
nose
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
being
the
most
prominentbottle
also
inludes
cardamon
and
cloves
spices
are
defentatley
present
in
the
tast
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
that
a
bit
of
pumpkin
doesnt
come
throughwich
sometimes
i
find
a
problem
with
other
pumpkin
ales
alcohol
is
overpowering
but
it
is
definately
present
and
creates
a
nice
warming
sensation
that
works
great
with
the
spices
and
pumpkin
this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
that
i
have
tried
also
what
an
awesome
label
i
will
pick
this
over
most
other
pumpkin
beers
this
season
some
are
just
too
sweet
for
me
but
this
nails
it
appearance
included
a
nice
frothy
head
but
really
the
smell
seamed
to
jump
from
the
glass
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
perfect
exactly
what
you
want
from
a
pumpkin
in
fall
flavorful
but
didnt
linger
for
too
long
the
imperial
pumpkin
lives
up
to
its
name
it
is
definitely
a
strong
pumpkin
ale
delicious
and
tasty
but
it
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
be
able
to
drink
too
many
of
in
one
sitting
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
as
summer
turns
into
fall
o
very
drinkable
the
spices
can
become
a
bit
much
but
it
was
very
enjoyable
overall
this
one
pours
a
lively
festive
orange
with
a
tall
tan
head
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
the
smell
is
warm
and
inviting
cinnamon
spice
sweet
bread
and
of
course
pumpkin
great
flavor
pumpkin
pie
spice
caramel
subtle
sweetness
there
is
some
heat
from
the
abv
but
not
to
much
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
thick
very
satisfying
a
fantastic
seasonal
beer
that
makes
you
feel
better
about
g
d
winter
coming
the
body
is
a
translucent
orange
and
brown
color
with
some
lighter
pumpkincolored
hues
in
the
thinner
regions
of
the
glass
the
head
was
small
off
the
pour
a
fingersbreadth
at
best
and
faded
relatively
quickly
to
nothing
but
a
ring
around
the
surface
of
the
liquid
the
smell
is
wonderful
nutmeg
cinnamon
clove
cardamom
some
pumpkin
and
even
a
faint
vanilla
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
bit
of
the
faint
pumpkin
in
the
front
before
the
rush
of
aforementioned
spices
dominate
a
bit
of
a
warming
alcohol
finish
along
with
the
faintest
vanilla
flavor
honestly
this
is
like
someone
took
pumpkin
pie
slapped
vanilla
ice
cream
on
top
and
found
a
way
to
bottle
it
the
mouth
is
rich
in
flavor
but
not
overly
thick
and
does
not
leave
any
kind
of
sugary
film
behind
very
well
done
exactly
what
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
and
i
certainly
wish
i
had
more
a
hugely
flavorful
big
pumpkin
ale
though
the
spices
are
the
star
and
not
at
all
the
pumpkin
o
good
and
while
im
not
sure
if
the
aggregate
score
above
is
going
to
give
this
a
better
score
than
saranacs
nonimperial
pumpkin
brew
i
think
i
actually
preferred
theres
to
weyerbacher
if
nothing
else
saranacs
is
a
lot
cheaper
and
has
about
90
of
the
flavor
of
this
od
in
my
opinion
no
pumpkin
ale
is
really
up
there
in
the
drinkability
department
this
is
ones
no
exception
a
good
brew
but
nothing
too
crazy
overall
smeh
maybe
i
should
give
up
on
the
pumpkins
o
there
are
some
great
flavor
profiles
but
a
little
watered
down
for
my
taste
o
another
nice
pumpkin
ale
though
i
must
say
shipyard
smashed
pumpkins
is
probably
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
still
but
ill
try
to
find
some
more
to
try
o
overall
another
solid
pumpkin
brew
the
highlight
is
the
nose
by
a
mile
but
not
bad
overall
a
great
pumpkin
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
pours
a
nice
dark
amberbrown
with
orange
highlights
beautiful
one
finger
cocoa
head
very
good
on
the
carbonation
and
lacing
a
somewhat
hazy
beer
that
you
cant
see
through
nose
is
really
nice
for
the
style
nutmeg
cinnamon
pumpkin
some
malt
really
good
especially
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
taste
follows
the
nose
with
nothing
really
changing
big
time
malt
backbone
on
this
brew
and
its
really
well
done
this
is
a
borderline
4
5
on
taste
alcohol
is
almost
completely
masked
w
at
8
is
pretty
good
mouthfeel
is
malt
smoothness
and
carbonation
bite
w
a
nice
lingering
aftertaste
somewhat
dry
finish
but
not
too
bad
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
pumpkin
ale
and
i
definitely
recommend
this
i
know
ill
pick
it
up
again
cheers
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
brownishorange
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
spicy
mostly
cinamon
some
pumpkin
taste
is
also
cinamon
up
front
some
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
this
is
the
first
pumpkin
beer
of
the
year
for
me
and
it
was
not
overpowering
like
some
can
be
also
it
is
nicely
balanced
with
every
thing
pumpkin
spices
and
alcohol
not
a
bad
beer
o
possibly
the
best
pumpkin
ive
ever
had
not
terribly
strong
on
the
alcohol
but
wonderously
complex
and
so
smooth
not
too
filling
just
wonderful
i
am
blown
away
by
how
good
this
beer
blends
all
the
ingredients
together
also
being
8
you
cant
pick
up
on
any
alcohol
o
a
good
pumpkin
offering
a
bit
heavy
on
the
spices
is
my
only
complaint
the
cloves
in
particular
o
overall
a
good
pumpkin
ale
id
prefer
a
more
pronounced
pumpkin
flavor
but
at
least
the
spices
are
not
overpowering
as
they
are
in
some
pumpkin
ales
o
a
very
unique
pumpkin
ale
has
a
slight
funkiness
to
it
which
i
like
reminds
me
of
a
good
french
or
alsacian
wine
sweet
but
not
too
much
so
and
the
spices
are
very
well
balanced
so
you
can
pinpoint
each
one
in
the
medley
of
flavors
highly
recommended
at
2
50
for
a
12oz
its
really
not
a
bad
deal
at
all
get
some
cheers
mouth
feel
and
overall
warm
and
tingly
on
the
tongue
i
continue
to
taste
different
notes
as
my
glass
empties
this
beer
surprises
you
and
leaves
you
in
suspense
of
what
youll
taste
next
delicious
medium
bodied
all
around
the
pumpkin
notes
are
making
themselves
better
known
towards
the
end
of
the
drink
and
then
everything
else
including
this
weyerbacher
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
but
not
in
the
same
league
as
any
of
the
aforementioned
brews
quite
nice
give
it
a
go
overall
if
you
love
fall
seasonals
like
i
do
go
for
this
one
but
be
warned
it
is
not
a
pumpkin
ale
for
beginners
this
is
not
a
training
wheels
pumpkin
ale
its
literally
like
liquid
pumpkin
pie
and
that
is
a
fantastic
thing
to
me
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
seasonal
i
was
hoping
the
taste
would
match
the
smell
but
still
not
bad
overall
o
a
pretty
over
the
top
pumpkin
ale
that
has
been
one
of
the
few
in
this
style
that
i
have
really
enjoyed
it
does
taste
like
liquid
pumpkin
pie
lots
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
are
very
prominent
if
you
dont
like
pumpkin
pie
stay
away
but
if
you
do
this
is
a
treat
overall
i
loved
the
way
this
beer
looked
and
smelled
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
very
average
in
my
opinion
maybe
my
taste
for
pumpkin
beers
is
fading
after
all
this
time
this
nice
pumpkin
ale
poured
reddish
amber
with
a
nice
head
the
lacing
was
adequate
and
had
a
pleasant
malty
taste
the
spices
were
spot
on
and
a
hint
of
pumpkin
and
vanilla
topped
it
off
it
was
like
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
without
the
overly
sweet
flavor
the
best
pumpkin
brew
i
have
tried
yet
it
is
a
pumpkin
beer
yes
but
so
much
deeper
and
flavorful
then
the
others
i
have
tried
it
is
a
pumpkin
brew
that
doesnt
forget
to
taste
like
beer
excellent
o
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
you
certainly
know
what
you
are
getting
with
this
beer
very
dominated
by
the
spices
noted
on
the
bottle
something
that
always
makes
me
think
less
of
a
brew
o
pretty
drinkable
spicy
and
malty
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
definitely
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
and
one
which
i
will
be
purchasing
again
othe
more
i
drink
this
more
flavors
start
to
pop
out
the
tastes
reminds
me
more
of
pumpkin
pie
crust
than
pumpkin
pie
pumpkins
or
anything
else
pumpkin
flavored
its
absolutely
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
had
it
drinks
very
well
for
the
abv
but
truthfully
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
bit
deeper
and
more
filling
i
think
if
weyerbacher
worked
on
this
one
a
bit
it
could
be
an
a
body
comes
off
a
little
thin
just
a
little
thin
and
maybe
some
more
pumpkin
flavors
would
help
otherwise
this
is
solid
stuff
an
excellent
brew
to
get
you
set
for
fall
and
everything
fall
im
already
looking
forward
to
having
more
jh
overall
it
was
okay
honestly
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
i
like
the
brews
that
arent
trying
to
overdo
that
pumpkin
pie
taste
and
use
more
of
that
natural
pumpkin
taste
but
it
was
like
they
did
that
but
then
overspiced
it
with
clove
but
there
just
seemed
to
be
something
off
about
this
one
o
pretty
pretty
pretty
pretty
good
stuff
great
for
blending
pumpkin
black
and
tans
poured
a
dark
amber
into
my
pint
with
oneinch
head
that
settles
in
to
reveal
a
nice
and
thorough
offwhite
film
atop
good
retention
and
some
lacing
really
well
established
look
to
this
brew
and
i
sense
lower
carbonation
there
is
a
strong
sweet
smell
of
pumpkin
and
a
fragrant
spiciness
is
noticed
right
away
good
blend
of
spices
and
good
job
on
achieving
a
natural
pumpkin
flavor
cloves
and
nutmeg
take
over
with
cinnamon
certainly
noticeable
not
overdone
by
any
means
a
subtle
aftertaste
of
the
spices
resides
a
smooth
imperial
ale
for
an
8
abv
with
no
detection
of
alcohol
whatsoever
not
as
heavy
as
i
expected
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
that
i
think
hit
most
of
the
marks
the
bottle
label
is
creepy
also
that
king
pumpkin
with
the
robe
a
solid
late
summer
release
pumpkin
brew
my
first
pumpkin
beer
of
the
season
and
want
more
o
very
nice
well
rounded
and
medium
bodied
beer
the
best
i
have
had
this
season
i
have
had
sa
octoberfest
and
shipyard
pumpkinhead
and
thios
beats
them
both
by
a
longshot
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
burnt
orange
with
just
less
than
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
receded
to
almost
nothing
after
a
moment
nice
aroma
of
fresh
pumpkin
and
nutty
grains
taste
was
what
a
pumpkin
ale
should
taste
like
rich
caramel
malts
to
start
followed
by
yummy
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
spice
not
subdued
its
pumpkin
and
thats
how
i
like
it
ends
a
little
bitter
with
some
finishing
hops
easily
detectable
medium
bodied
and
smooth
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
overall
best
of
the
pumpkin
beers
that
have
been
released
so
far
this
season
that
are
available
in
central
ohio
lets
of
exceptions
have
to
be
made
in
august
i
suppose
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
o
i
am
very
sad
that
this
beer
is
not
distributed
in
this
area
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
in
the
fall
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
o
tried
this
one
a
night
after
i
tried
southern
tiers
pumking
weyerbachers
isnt
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
pumking
but
both
are
excellent
in
their
own
right
definitely
worth
a
try
o
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
right
up
there
with
dfh
punkin
cardamom
is
the
spice
that
brings
it
all
home
havent
seen
this
in
many
other
pumpkins
and
really
seems
to
give
it
a
great
pumpkin
pie
flavor
without
being
over
the
top
im
using
it
as
a
guide
for
my
pumpkin
homebrew
this
weekend
a
more
casual
review
admittedly
but
it
suffices
to
say
that
i
deeply
enjoyed
this
beer
i
am
happy
to
say
that
it
fell
into
the
better
of
the
extremes
its
still
august
but
fall
cant
come
soon
enough
im
feelin
this
good
and
im
only
one
and
a
half
in
overall
you
gotta
love
the
taste
of
autumn
in
august
im
glad
weyebacher
releases
this
during
the
later
summer
months
a
nice
slow
sipping
beer
with
a
ton
of
flavor
my
other
favorite
is
southampton
pumpkin
ale
now
i
will
have
a
decision
to
make
when
it
comes
to
committing
to
a
16th
keg
of
this
style
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
will
make
me
ponder
my
choice
for
sure
well
done
an
exceptional
pumpkin
beer
big
pumpkin
flavors
meshing
with
sweet
malts
and
just
a
bit
of
floral
hops
with
a
nice
spicy
finish
comes
out
a
bit
early
for
a
pumpkin
beer
but
hey
im
not
complaining
m
fairly
thick
but
not
necessarily
creamy
mediumheavy
with
a
midrange
carbonation
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
dryness
on
the
back
end
o
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
one
of
the
better
that
ive
had
a
little
bit
bitter
than
some
but
more
flavorful
than
others
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
low
carbonation
makes
it
a
little
weird
but
maybe
it
was
just
this
bottle
i
will
see
with
the
others
othis
years
version
is
good
i
remember
last
years
being
a
bit
better
but
cant
put
my
finger
on
why
for
some
reason
this
year
it
doesnt
extremely
wow
me
like
it
did
previous
years
its
still
damn
good
though
o
love
it
didnt
review
it
last
year
but
i
think
i
like
2011
better
mouthfeel
a
little
strange
i
would
like
it
to
be
more
creamy
instead
it
tingles
the
tongue
there
is
a
drying
alcohol
finish
a
little
more
sweetness
and
a
fuller
creamier
body
would
benefit
this
beer
in
my
opinion
d
very
nice
rendition
of
pumpkin
ale
and
worth
a
pickup
i
can
see
these
being
dangerous
hurray
i
really
enjoy
the
taste
of
it
but
in
my
opinion
drinks
pretty
light
for
an
8
percent
overall
i
did
enjoy
it
cheers
overall
im
pretty
sad
though
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
considering
so
many
people
talk
about
the
great
foamy
head
on
this
beer
im
on
my
last
8oz
now
and
while
im
not
really
enjoying
it
all
that
much
and
im
surely
not
feeling
pumpkin
pie
which
is
what
i
want
to
feel
i
can
say
this
beer
does
have
a
fall
feel
to
it
if
anything
else
it
reminds
me
of
autumn
and
the
turn
of
the
seasons
prost
love
weyerbacher
pumpkin
i
look
forward
to
having
at
least
one
bottle
of
this
every
year
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
really
deep
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
that
sorta
fades
away
quickly
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
super
spicy
lots
of
cinnamon
allspice
and
nutmeg
in
here
mixed
with
a
booze
like
aroma
too
the
taste
is
near
perfect
the
whole
flavor
comes
together
with
the
mixture
of
pumpkin
and
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavier
than
medium
overall
this
is
probably
a
top
5
on
the
pumpkin
beer
chart
for
me
perfect
dessert
substitution
for
thanksgiving
or
after
any
fall
meal
in
my
opinion
this
is
in
the
top
2
pumpkin
beer
category
if
you
ask
me
ranks
above
even
elysian
night
owl
as
the
best
quality
beerpumpkin
creations
available
o
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
and
will
probably
have
it
again
next
season
not
the
best
one
out
there
but
its
worth
trying
this
pours
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacings
upon
first
smell
i
was
quite
excited
at
the
variety
of
aromapumpkin
cinnamon
cloves
the
taste
is
good
with
lots
of
sharp
spice
on
the
tongue
but
the
flaors
compete
too
much
for
me
to
really
enjoy
each
rating
43343
the
imperial
pumpkin
ale
from
weyerbacher
is
very
complex
and
delicious
i
have
had
an
affection
for
all
things
pumpkin
for
quite
sometime
its
not
necessarily
the
pumpkin
as
much
as
it
is
all
that
comes
with
that
the
pumkin
spice
ginger
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
other
spices
make
for
a
great
paring
with
the
beer
flavoring
i
do
a
bit
of
home
brewing
and
i
try
and
make
a
batch
of
pumkin
ale
every
fall
though
i
dont
always
landed
a
knockout
blow
on
taste
the
smell
is
always
amazing
i
have
a
bit
of
practiceing
to
do
anyways
back
to
the
weyerbacher
the
pumpkin
ale
by
weyrbacher
is
a
great
one
the
flavor
is
very
spicy
and
complex
the
smell
is
of
delicious
spices
the
only
complaint
i
have
is
there
is
a
pretty
powerful
alcohol
taste
mixed
in
which
isnt
surprising
due
to
its
8
0
alcohol
content
that
being
said
its
still
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
out
there
beer
is
thinner
than
expected
although
now
that
i
know
its
8
my
respect
for
it
goes
up
a
little
very
little
beer
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
slight
lingering
aftertaste
but
that
is
most
likely
due
to
how
damn
dry
the
finish
is
i
can
actually
taste
a
little
pumpkin
in
here
thats
very
cool
for
a
pumpkin
ale
its
ok
pretty
good
in
fact
im
not
a
huge
style
but
i
give
them
a
go
every
year
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
in
my
opinioin
i
would
cautiously
have
this
again
d
dangerous
because
its
delicious
not
a
heady
brew
so
beware
if
you
drink
more
than
one
pairs
well
with
a
lot
of
fall
foods
pork
chicken
desserts
etc
poured
from
12

mildmedium

and

this
is
a
decent
beer
and
the
spices
are
downplayed
which
is
a
hindrance
from
the
flavor
in
itself
one
of
my
top
pumpkin
beers
an
interesting
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
better
and
i
have
also
had
far
worse
this
is
a
bit
too
spicy
for
me
but
i
would
not
label
it
as
a
spice
bomb
d
this
isnt
incredibly
balanced
but
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
pours
dark
coppermahogany
with
thin
offwhite
head
some
sediment
in
the
suspension
i
can
smell
the
spice
from
the
glass
cinnamon
clove
and
nutmeg
taste
is
sweet
with
a
maltiness
that
is
reminiscent
of
pie
crust
slightly
overbaked
a
little
bitterness
as
well
not
cloying
whatsoever
medium
bodied
with
a
sticky
texture
and
fizzy
overall
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
thick
and
murky
brown

small
tan

proves
to
be
fleeting
scent
is
a
major
pumpkin
smell
along
with
some
spicy

light
buscuity

is
pretty
much
controlled

the
overriding

sharp
one
of
the
better
pumpkins
ive
had
hv
d
good
tasting
pumpkin
gritty
at
first
but
smoothed
a
brew
that
i
would
have
again
i
recommend
this
brew
d
too
sweet
and
spicy
for
me
easy
to
drink
one
we
have
tried
several
of
the
pumkin
brews
this
fall
and
weyerbacher
is
indeed
the
best
of
the
best
most
of
the
pumkins
we
have
tried
this
fall
short
on
flavor
and
are
primarily
focused
on
that
sweet
spicey
kick
this
beer
is
a
strong
full
flavored
very
dark
brew
not
too
bitter
with
a
clean
finish
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
the
pumpkin
ales
but
this
was
very
tasty
the
flavor
was
strong
and
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
when
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
i
didnt
have
a
lot
of
head
to
it
but
a
nice
amber
color
body
and
a
thin
white
lace
around
the
edge
of
the
body
the
aroma
of
this
beer
of
roasted
pumpkin
pie
spices
the
taste
is
unbelievable
the
taste
of
the
clove
allspice
and
nutmeg
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
and
the
balance
of
the
malts
and
pumpkin
is
very
well
done
it
has
a
great
mouth
feel
and
is
very
smooth
off
the
tongue
and
is
very
drinkable
d
this
is
very
good
not
quite
the
best
of
the
style
but
its
up
there
a
big
pumpkin
ale
that
is
well
crafted
and
delicious
pours
a
very
clear
orangey
brown
with
a
long
lasting
khaki
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lace
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
smell
is
full
of
pumpkin
and
spices
there
is
a
good
amount
of
bready
sweet
malt
as
well
balanced
taste
is
the
hallmark
of
this
one
it
starts
with
pumpkin
pie
and
flows
seamlessly
into
a
firm
herbal
bitterness
a
nice
crystal
malt
center
gives
a
bready
roundness
and
full
ale
taste
spices
bracket
the
pumpkin
a
with
the
cinnamon
in
the
front
and
the
nutmeg
giving
a
fullness
to
the
flavor
a
touch
of
alcohol
shows
itself
and
fades
away
finish
is
dry
and
clean
with
a
lingering
hop
leafiness
feel
is
crisp
and
well
carbonated
medium
weight
and
quite
supple
very
drinkable
with
a
well
integrated
alcohol
that
never
gets
your
attention
so
the
next
thing
you
know
your
smiling
a
whole
lot
good
stuff
overall
this
is
a
solid
seasonal
offering
and
it
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
the
flavor
of
pumpkin
is
restrained
in
this
beer
the
emphasis
is
placed
on
the
spice
in
other
words
if
you
eat
pumpkin
pie
for
the
taste
of
pumpkin
you
may
not
like
this
beer
if
however
you
enjoy
spice
and
balance
this
beer
has
those
qualities
in
spades
d
i
need
a
cold
night
and
a
hot
fire
to
enjoy
this
one
while
the
flavor
is
great
initially
the
spices
particularly
the
cardamom
become
unmanageable
making
the
imperial
pumpkin
ale
a
sipper
a
very
slow
sipper
one
glass
is
more
than
enough
for
me
overall
would
not
have
again
not
generally
a
huge
fan
of
pumpking
beers
but
this
wasnt
bad
at
all
special
thanks
to
tubdog13
for
the
care
package
that
had
this
in
it
drinkability
pretty
poundable
as
far
as
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
they
would
probably
catch
up
to
me
on
bottle
number
four
or
five
abv
wise
overall
a
pleasant
beer
not
on
the
same
level
as
a
southern
tier
pumpking
or
hoppin
frog
but
im
honestly
thinking
this
bottle
may
be
a
year
old
and
has
lost
a
lot
of
the
pumpkin
character
as
a
result
that
said
this
is
still
a
great
brew
in
its
own
right
hats
off
to
weyerbacher
well
done
its
definitely
not
a
bad
brew
many
of
my
friends
swear
by
it
i
just
think
that
there
are
better
choices
out
there
at
8
this
firstandforemost
is
not
a
beer
you
can
spend
a
full
night
drinking
and
feel
good
the
next
morning
secondly
with
its
spicinesson
both
its
aroma
and
its
taste
its
a
beer
thats
tough
to
imagine
drinking
several
of
although
i
will
say
since
its
warmed
up
the
medicinal
edge
has
worn
off
at
least
making
it
easier
to
drink
with
that
all
said
again
its
hard
to
imagine
drinking
this
beer
all
night
a
well
made
beer
sure
flavorful
definitely
but
one
that
id
want
to
drink
all
night
not
really
best
that
its
like
the
pie
of
its
chief
ingredient
enjoyed
seasonally
and
sparingly
medium
body
higher
carbonation
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
but
the
heavy
spices
limit
the
drinkability
good
fall
or
even
christmas
beer
dont
notice
the
8abv
this
thing
rocks
if
you
are
looking
for
a
pumpkin
ale
that
is
pretty
interpretive
of
a
pumpkin
pie
you
really
cant
miss
with
this
d
it
is
a
stronger
version
of
a
pumpkin
ale
but
it
has
a
seasonal
appeal
and
i
was
in
the
mood
for
it
so
it
went
down
well
that
being
said
i
could
not
session
this
beer
though
it
has
too
much
clove
nutmeg
and
spice
d
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
the
warm
feeling
it
leaves
you
with
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
i
think
you
can
sit
back
and
drink
several
in
a
sitting
awesome
fall
drink
recommended
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
a
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
well
executed
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
an
inch
of
creamy
tan
head
and
light
lacing
great
spicy
aromas
on
this
pumpkin
ale
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
and
ofcourse
pumpkin
this
is
my
favorite
tasting
pumpkin
ale
on
the
market
follows
right
in
line
with
the
smell
but
to
a
greater
extent
its
more
of
a
spicy
pumpkin
but
i
find
the
pumpkin
flavor
shows
its
face
plenty
in
this
ale
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
makes
this
my
favorite
beer
in
the
style
a
big
enough
pumpkin
ale
that
i
can
really
only
enjoy
1
of
these
in
a
night
hence
the
lower
drinkability
score
great
seasonal
offering
from
weyerbacher
highly
recommended
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
brown
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
that
settles
to
a
fresh
tan
collar
smell
is
vienna
maltsspiceand
pumpkin
breadand
cinnamon
stick
taste
is
very
spicy
meaning
its
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
more
so
than
pumpkin
but
its
present
in
a
bread
like
manner
malts
hit
the
back
of
the
mouth
for
a
sweet
finish
mouth
feel
is
medium
i
dont
detect
8
but
i
dont
taste
lots
of
pumpkin
either
overall
pretty
tasty
easy
to
drink
and
one
ill
have
every
fall
but
thats
it
a
tasty
pumpkin
ale
from
a
great
brewery
d
easily
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
most
pumpkin
beers
are
spicy
but
also
a
little
watery
this
one
packs
a
nice
nutmeg
punch
that
is
anything
but
subtle
fullbodied
i
exepcted
it
to
be
even
more
punchy
as
an
imperial
ale
but
its
fairly
calm
for
that
label
not
in
bad
way
went
well
with
a
stew
of
keilbasa
sweet
potatoe
apples
and
onion
overall
good
beer
overall
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
but
you
could
do
much
worse
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
this
autumn
really
good
pumpkin
ale
among
the
best
ive
had
d
i
hate
the
feeling
of
having
my
hopes
dashed
i
expected
great
things
after
taking
a
whiff
but
the
flavor
didnt
follow
through
im
not
mad
weyerbacher
im
just
disappointed
md
medium
body
with
a
big
mouthfeel
good
carb
noticeable
abv
finishes
quite
neutral
with
some
sweetness
and
some
bittering
great
flavor
profile
makes
it
easy
to
drink
ive
noticed
the
quality
varies
here
and
there
depending
on
the
batch
i
suppose
it
can
be
a
wide
spread
too
because
ive
had
this
end
up
being
revelatory
one
time
and
outofwhack
another
when
its
good
though
its
real
good
this
was
a
pretty
good
surprise
feel
is
creamy
but
overly
spiced
great
taste
but
a
bit
bitter
and
overly
spiced
to
be
highly
drinkable
taste
has
lots
of
toasted
caramel
with
the
sweetness
and
spicing
playing
nicely
off
each
other
has
more
oomph
than
a
regular
pumpkin
brew
but
not
over
the
top
as
say
a
pumking
nice
gourdy
flavors
shows
through
on
this
one
and
the
abv
is
very
well
hidden
it
is
a
tasty
brew
id
probably
put
this
in
my
top
5
pumpkin
beers
well
done
weyerbacher
d
at
8
you
notice
this
stuff
going
down
as
the
alcohol
isnt
terribly
well
disguised
a
tasty
beer
but
not
one
youll
want
to
drink
all
evening
d
this
is
not
a
top
tier
pumpkin
beer
it
is
enjoyable
but
i
find
this
to
be
more
spicy
than
anything
else
the
alcohol
presence
does
not
belong
and
they
should
have
just
made
a
pumpkin
ale
it
could
have
been
so
much
better
with
just
a
label
change
and
alcohol
reduction
i
probably
wont
ever
search
this
one
out
again
pours
a
somewhat
hazed
orange
color
with
a
light
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
fairly
balanced
between
pumpkin
sweetness
and
some
fall
spicing
although
the
sweetness
tilts
ahead
in
the
end
the
taste
brings
a
lot
more
pumpkin
sweetness
with
some
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
clove
in
the
background
a
bit
faint
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
a
tad
bit
cloying
drinks
pretty
well
although
i
hope
itll
mellow
a
bit
with
some
age
md
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
left
my
mouth
a
little
on
the
dry
side
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
it
left
me
a
bit
dissapointed
its
ok
but
nothing
special
seemed
a
bit
weak
in
flavors
i
think
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
especially
if
you
dont
usually
like
pumpkin
beers
that
are
too
sweet
or
too
chocked
full
of
spices
dpretty
high
considering
the
abv
but
i
feel
let
down
by
pumpkin
beers
in
general
and
this
one
falls
into
that
category
unfortunately
very
drinkable
doesnt
go
overboard
in
any
direction
and
the
alky
warmth
is
nothing
close
to
oppressive
easily
the
2nd
best
pumpkin
ive
had
to
date
easily
slotting
ahead
of
dogfish
head
but
still
a
half
notch
behind
the
incredible
hoppin
frog
version
a
very
solid
pumpkin
ale
drinkability
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
this
year
this
one
is
pumpkiny
without
being
overly
so
i
can
feel
the
alcohol
i
would
get
this
again
a
nice
surprise
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
inch
of
light
tan
head
this
beer
is
burnt
orange
in
color
the
aroma
is
definitely
spicy
nutmeg
seems
to
lead
the
pack
the
taste
is
some
pumpkin
up
front
and
then
the
spices
take
over
as
with
the
smell
the
nutmeg
seems
dominant
although
i
can
taste
cinnamon
too
i
also
get
whiffs
of
alcohol
on
the
senses
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
its
a
pretty
good
beer
i
can
think
of
two
in
this
style
that
i
like
a
lot
better
d
one
of
the
better
ones
you
can
taste
the
abv
which
gives
it
a
smooth
kick
wow
it
looks
like
fall
smells
like
fall
and
tastes
like
everything
i
expect
from
a
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
malt
pumpkin
spices
and
hops
definitely
in
the
top
tier
of
the
pumpkin
ales
ive
tasted
highly
recommended
from
my
comments
you
can
tell
i
wont
get
this
beer
again
the
allspice
was
to
powerful
if
they
toned
that
down
flavors
may
pop
more
and
then
they
may
have
a
good
beer
drinkability
for
any
pumpkin
ale
it
is
a
beer
that
you
normally
do
no
session
this
is
no
exception
however
for
such
a
high
abv
this
beer
disappeared
rather
quickly
im
liking
the
heavy
spices
and
really
wish
i
had
some
pumpkin
pie
to
eat
with
this
because
it
sure
feels
like
im
drinking
some
pumped
i
was
able
to
try
this
and
scratch
it
off
my
wants
list
very
good
beer
just
the
right
amount
of
pumpkin
flavor
and
very
smooth
for
being
8abv
i
am
trying
to
find
many
pumpkin
beers
to
try
but
i
have
a
limited
selection
where
i
am
weyerbacher
is
similar
to
pumpking
from
southern
tier
i
like
this
style
for
the
fall
cant
drink
these
as
a
session
beer
this
is
a
must
try
for
the
fall
bit
carbonated
no
alcohol
noticeable
very
smooth
and
would
make
a
good
nice
capper
or
dessert
beer
this
is
a
really
nice
pumpkin
ale
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
nice
copper
orange
color
with
moderate
offwhite
head
smell
is
deliciously
spicey
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
followed
up
with
some
nice
pumpkin
aroma
taste
mirrors
the
nose
big
spices
big
pumpkin
delicious
stuff
sometimes
it
comes
across
as
a
hair
boozy
moderate
mouthfeel
coating
a
good
drink
definitely
a
seasonal
specialty
that
hits
the
spot
another
great
brew
by
the
people
at
weyerbacher
i
have
a
few
more
that
ill
be
holding
on
to
throughout
fall
and
winter
to
help
warm
up
in
the
pa
cold
d
for
an
8
abv
beer
it
should
be
sipped
but
very
tasty
and
goes
down
smoothly
drinkability
its
a
good
one
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
sts
pumking
which
sets
the
bar
high
for
imperial
pumpkin
beers
di
could
drink
2
or
3
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
for
other
pumpkin
beers
that
are
either
too
sweet
or
lack
flavor
a
very
wellbalanced
wellexecuted
pumpkin
ale
pumpkin
and
spice
contribute
but
dont
dominate
which
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
very
nice
d
this
pumpkin
ale
is
good
the
flavors
are
crisp
and
clean
with
this
not
being
overly
sweet
like
some
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
the
abv
is
higer
but
well
hidden
which
means
you
can
get
into
trouble
with
this
one
was
glad
to
have
gotten
two
of
these
bad
boys
in
my
package
maybe
i
picked
up
some
bad
stuff
but
this
kind
of
doesnt
taste
like
beer
it
looked
and
smelled
awesome
and
then
turned
into
something
else
i
think
id
take
a
pumpking
or
even
a
post
road
pumpkin
over
this
i
call
shenanigans
on
this
beer
shenanigans
i
have
one
bottle
left
and
its
getting
poured
over
a
ham
better
than
down
my
throat
drinkability
the
imperial
pumpkin
drinks
smoothly
considering
the
strength
and
amount
of
spice
its
very
addictive
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
out
there
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
all
no
single
taste
or
aroma
is
overbearing
and
its
well
balanced
probably
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
this
season
drinkability
for
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
weighing
in
at
8
its
pretty
damn
drinkable
the
taste
is
ok
though
id
drink
this
one
again
but
if
i
had
a
choice
id
have
to
pick
other
pumpkin
offerings
over
this
one
d
a
great
pumpkin
ale
that
may
get
to
me
after
awhile
the
style
in
general
has
medium
drinkability
for
me
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
and
for
this
pumpkin
its
the
opposite
of
most
in
the
style
the
taste
is
more
pronounced
and
bolder
than
the
smell
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
is
moderately
carbonated
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
still
keep
trying
them
since
its
that
time
of
the
year
poured
a
translucent
reddish
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
with
much
lacing
smell
is
of
pumpkin
and
spices
the
taste
is
very
rich
with
pumpkin
and
pielike
spices
a
near
perfect
balance
between
the
two
no
alcohol
presence
was
detected
despite
the
8
abv
this
is
one
of
the
fullest
and
tastiest
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
mouthfeel
was
good
very
lively
and
refreshing
drinkability
was
ok
but
lots
of
alcohol
and
real
rich
taste
for
me
makes
this
a
one
at
a
time
beer
to
sip
and
savor
for
pumpkin
it
doesnt
really
get
any
better
than
this
drinkability
this
one
has
everything
a
pumpkin
ale
should
have
without
overdoing
it
in
any
particular
aspect
the
abv
is
up
there
but
still
very
drinkable
d
easy
drinker
no
cloying
spice
or
sweetness
i
prefer
punkin
pumpking
or
bruery
autumn
maple
to
this
brew
d
a
good
pumpkin
beer
but
a
little
heavy
on
the
spices
nice
dryness
to
the
finish
with
characteristics
of
brown
sugar
mouth
feel
is
surprisingly
thin
somewhere
the
8
percent
abv
is
hiding
in
here
but
i
am
not
sure
behind
what
d
one
is
great
2
is
good
3
too
many
d
this
is
a
good
offering
amongst
pumpkin
brews
but
not
quite
a
standout
the
carbonation
is
good
but
the
body
is
just
a
touch
watery
for
me
however
its
refreshing
and
finishes
with
lingering
spice
and
sweet
malt
i
like
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
but
im
not
sure
itll
be
a
yearly
thing
this
year
im
really
steering
clear
of
the
pumpkin
beers
for
the
oktoberfests
and
while
this
is
well
crafted
its
just
nothing
new
good
pumpkin
ale
to
try
but
not
one
to
invest
in
i
buy
this
in
season
even
my
girlfriend
likes
it
so
that
tells
you
something
love
this
seasonal
i
love
weyerbacher
d
if
you
like
pumpkin
look
elsewhere
but
if
you
like
spice
beer
i
happen
to
like
cinnamon
a
lot
this
might
be
your
bag
a
pumpkin
ale
it
is
not
this
is
top
of
the
line
in
nearly
every
way
possibly
weyerbachers
best
beer
this
really
is
a
fall
treat
is
it
the
best
out
there
no
but
it
is
really
close
easily
in
the
top
5
of
the
style
d
i
solid
beer
and
i
probably
liked
it
a
little
more
than
my
final
score
reflects
imo
the
flavor
is
not
quite
what
im
looking
for
in
a
pumpkin
ale
a
good
brew
nonetheless
db
nice
flavor
for
some
reason
the
alcohol
makes
me
care
about
the
strong
spice
less
still
wish
these
pumpkin
beers
would
taste
more
like
fresh
pumpkin
the
flavor
gets
tiring
decent
fall
beer
this
is
a
sipper
of
a
pumpkin
ale
and
while
i
have
far
from
tried
them
all
this
remains
my
favorite
recommended
grab
one
and
enjoy
d
8
00
is
invisible
in
this
very
easy
drinking
spices
are
there
but
nowhere
near
overpowering
my
second
ever
pumpkin
beer
and
my
new
favorite
pours
reddishpale
amber
in
body
topped
by
creamy
offwhite
head
smells
of
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
burnt
pumpkin
pie
crust
and
booze
flavors
of
spice
that
leans
towards
cinnamon
burnt
sugars
cloves
pumpkin
booze
mouthful
of
spice
towards
the
end
heavy
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
an
imperial
pumpkin
that
is
too
big
for
its
own
good
like
a
spoonful
of
cinnamon
this
beer
closes
up
the
throat
a
bit
all
frosting
and
no
pie
for
me
this
is
the
pumpkin
beer
that
all
others
are
measured
against
a
true
feat
d
once
this
4pk
is
finished
ill
be
done
with
this
until
next
year
if
i
decide
to
try
it
again
one
bottle
per
sitting
is
enough
for
me
there
isnt
enough
pumpkin
to
go
with
the
spice
or
theres
too
much
spice
to
go
with
the
hint
of
pumpkin
worth
a
try
but
this
pumpkin
ale
didnt
exactly
blow
me
away
notes
had
this
on
tap
a
couple
of
days
earlier
and
it
seemed
much
better
then
but
unfortunately
i
didnt
get
a
review
down
overall
a
fun
sipper
on
a
cold
fall
night
at
least
a
night
that
feels
like
fall
this
one
is
a
spice
overload
which
i
didnt
recall
from
the
past
i
also
didnt
pick
up
the
strong
vanilla
flavors
ive
come
to
love
in
this
beer
nonetheless
still
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
out
there
d
no
thanks
just
not
for
me
to
each
his
own
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
bold
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
slightly
offwhite
one
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
fairly
thick
collar
carbonation
is
on
the
heavy
side
with
the
head
making
a
fizzy
sound
as
it
fades
aroma
is
spicy
the
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
cloves
jump
right
out
at
you
first
sip
is
a
smooth
blend
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
cloves
basically
a
mirror
image
of
the
aroma
the
combination
of
spice
lingers
after
the
swallow
hops
pretty
much
take
a
back
seat
here
this
ones
all
pumpkiny
malt
spices
but
done
well
quite
well
in
fact
mouth
feel
is
bold
and
spicy
with
a
nice
sparkle
on
the
tongue
and
the
alcohol
being
totally
hidden
this
is
a
beer
that
is
quite
drinkable
overall
if
you
like
pumpkin
beer
which
i
do
this
one
is
quite
the
stellar
example
of
the
style
if
you
dropped
a
scoop
if
ice
cream
into
it
youd
truly
have
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
above
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
it
had
some
good
flavors
to
it
overall
it
was
definitely
a
spice
forward
beer
but
they
were
pretty
nicely
done
could
have
used
some
more
pumpkin
flavor
and
less
spice
to
it
though
for
my
tastes
pours
an
orangish
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
which
gives
way
to
some
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
nice
pumpkin
smell
with
hints
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
a
slight
clove
the
taste
is
of
a
bread
malt
backbone
with
a
nice
pumpkin
flavor
along
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
taste
but
solid
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
its
a
solid
beer
and
its
very
drinkable
but
its
not
the
top
pumpkin
beer
but
close
d
i
felt
this
beer
was
okay
but
one
was
enough
for
me
i
thought
the
beer
smelled
like
pumpkin
pie
but
then
something
about
the
flavor
was
not
right
when
i
tasted
it
i
dont
mean
to
say
i
think
the
beer
was
bad
just
that
the
clove
was
too
much
for
me
on
a
final
note
abv
8
but
the
taste
of
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
this
one
is
worth
a
try
d
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
that
is
heavy
on
the
spices
i
enjoyed
the
cinnamon
in
the
smell
but
may
have
liked
it
a
little
better
if
the
taste
was
more
pumpkin
or
sweeter
than
spice
still
a
good
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
before
and
will
have
again
bottom
line
imperial
and
pumpkin
just
seems
right
this
brews
bark
may
be
bigger
than
its
bite
but
it
will
still
gnaw
your
knuckles
off
d
i
may
just
pick
up
a
four
pack
its
quite
good
and
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
its
not
hoppy
joy
drinkability
overall
it
seems
like
a
nice
old
ale
that
has
been
enhanced
and
elevated
by
pumpkin
and
spices
the
end
result
is
a
very
strong
pumpkin
ale
that
simply
entices
me
to
drink
more
still
the
lesser
of
the
2
this
beer
is
a
little
darker
than
most
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tasted
smells
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
are
present
smells
just
like
pumpkin
pie
is
being
baked
taste
is
more
cinnamon
and
spices
than
it
is
off
pumpkin
can
taste
the
cinnamon
aftertaste
but
it
is
not
terrible
could
probably
drink
a
couple
before
getting
filled
up
a
great
beer
may
have
to
get
a
case
of
this
next
year
if
not
better
than
the
st
pumking
i
am
picking
up
saturday
the
key
to
this
successful
pumpkin
ale
is
that
they
dont
overdo
the
pumpkin
pie
sensation
others
seem
to
like
to
produce
yeah
im
talking
about
you
dfh
this
still
hasnt
won
me
over
to
the
style
though
medium
carbonation
is
nice
and
medium
low
body
8
abv
booziness
is
hidden
well
i
pretty
much
dont
care
for
many
fruit
beers
so
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
expected
too
probably
wouldnt
be
too
interested
in
having
a
second
bottle
in
one
sitting
though
maybe
unless
it
was
thanksgiving
and
this
was
the
only
beer
sitting
around
it
paired
really
nicely
with
good
sharp
ginger
snap
cookies
for
an
afterdinner
desert
pours
a
rich
clear
amber
with
a
vast
fluffy
flowery
head
the
aroma
is
sharp
and
warm
and
spicy
more
like
a
mulled
cider
than
anything
else
there
is
cinnamon
and
clove
and
a
high
crisp
ginger
aroma
the
flavor
is
round
and
malty
and
spicy
clove
nutmeg
and
ginger
there
is
a
spicy
cinnamon
burn
on
the
finish
that
coats
the
tongue
there
is
a
little
sourish
edge
that
hurts
the
finish
a
bit
but
still
this
feels
like
fall
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
creamy
d
i
dont
mind
the
onslaught
of
spice
but
the
boozy
twang
affects
drinkability
in
regards
to
this
particular
style
there
is
plenty
of
flavor
here
to
hide
8
so
im
a
bit
surprised
2010
edition
sampled
on
september
7
2010
the
pour
is
a
much
darker
than
expected
copperamber
tone
with
a
thin
but
long
lasting
offwhite
head
ring
the
aroma
is
powerful
with
pumpkins
and
fall
baking
spices
like
nutmeg
coriander
and
clove
the
taste
emphasizes
the
spices
over
the
pumpkin
but
there
is
also
a
molasseslike
dark
sweetness
going
on
a
very
vibrant
brew
for
sure
its
a
strong
beer

youll
know
it
not
something
i
think
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
but
me
enjoying
a
pint
on
the
porch
when
the
leaves
start
changing
is
almost
a
certainty
this
beer
is
a
deep
ruby
red
with
about
a
finger
of
just
off
white
head
it
recedes
a
little
bit
leaving
a
ring
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
it
smells
strongly
of
cloves
with
some
of
the
malt
and
pumpkin
sweetness
coming
through
the
other
spices
that
are
used
cinnamon
nutmeg
etc
dont
seem
to
come
through
as
much
the
beer
tastes
like
halloween
a
holiday
mainly
composed
of
cloves
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
with
malt
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
unfortunately
the
mouthfeel
comes
up
pretty
thin
for
me
it
has
good
drinkability
but
would
probably
be
better
if
i
had
had
it
in
october
or
november
instead
of
the
beginning
of
september
i
wont
fault
the
beer
because
i
did
not
have
the
good
sense
to
wait
to
drink
it
all
in
all
i
like
this
brew
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
to
date
id
say
if
you
want
a
good
pumpkin
beer
then
definitely
grab
one
of
this
and
give
it
a
try
d
a
nice
smooth
imperial
pumpkin
easy
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
a
couple
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
d
nose
with
the
style
are
great
combinations
ammendment
my
quest
never
seems
to
find
a
better
pumpkin
ale
this
is
the
one
for
me
an
enjoyable
and
well
done
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
this
is
probably
the
spiciest
pumpkin
beer
out
there
and
i
would
put
this
in
my
top
two
to
date
really
well
hidden
eight
percent
abv
not
too
much
spice
it
is
a
sharper
less
sweet
version
though
with
more
robust
flavors
then
somthing
like
pumpking
drinkability
is
very
high
and
abv
is
nearly
undetectable
pours
an
amber
color
producing
about
a
half
inch
of
head
before
quickly
dissipating
the
smell
is
what
makes
this
beer
i
dont
quite
sense
the
cinnamon
nearly
as
much
as
i
smell
the
nutmeg
and
cloves
it
immediately
reminds
me
of
autumn
and
the
smells
of
the
upcoming
holidays
it
tastes
like
well
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
it
is
loaded
with
spices
and
it
has
a
huge
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
clove
taste
and
is
fairly
well
carbonated
it
is
very
light
and
goes
down
very
easily
i
couldnt
drink
this
all
year
but
it
certainly
fits
into
the
autumn
season
d
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
that
is
well
balanced
and
delicious
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
weyerbacher
in
usual
fashion
make
this
one
big
dark
amber
good
retention
nice
cream
lace
that
looks
to
last
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
nose
taste
is
good
pretty
standard
but
the
cardoman
adds
a
little
something
different
to
this
one
kind
of
unique
alcochol
is
also
present
on
the
tongue
pretty
well
blends
with
the
malt
and
spices
very
drinkable
bubbly
tingle
on
the
mouthfeel
finishes
a
little
dry
nice
md
smooth
spices
give
a
sort
of
tingle
along
with
the
carbonation
which
makes
for
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
d
this
is
not
a
beer
i
want
to
drink
a
bunch
of
the
flavors
are
excellent
and
this
is
a
finely
crafted
brew
but
just
a
little
too
much
for
me
to
enjoy
constantly
pours
a
deep
hazy
amber
with
a
little
less
than
a
finger
of
off
white
head
not
much
retention
some
lacing
a
good
but
by
no
means
great
appearance
the
aroma
however
is
aone
outstanding
and
really
well
captured
in
the
wineglass
nice
fresh
pumpkin
accompanied
by
strong
notes
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
maybe
some
ginger
wow
this
is
the
smell
i
look
for
in
my
pumpkin
ales
imo
they
nailed
it
that
said
i
feel
the
flavor
takes
a
step
back
maybe
the
nose
raised
expectations
too
high
still
very
nice
with
the
pumpkin
and
spices
pulling
through
but
perhaps
not
as
robustly
as
the
nose
had
led
me
to
believe
theres
also
a
not
entirely
pleasant
though
subtle
bitterness
to
it
as
well
as
a
bit
a
boozy
bite
to
the
finish
again
though
a
damn
tasty
pumpkin
beer
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
and
well
worth
a
revisit
but
ill
work
my
way
around
some
others
first
dm
crisp
and
bubbly
it
has
a
great
filling
flavor
but
it
sticks
to
palate
and
makes
it
hard
to
change
to
a
different
beer
d
pretty
drinkable
a
slight
boozy
taste
is
the
only
thing
holding
this
back
pretty
similar
to
pumpkin
pie
this
is
my
first
pumpkin
beer
of
the
season
and
i
cant
wait
for
more
pours
a
deep
hazy
rubyorange
with
some
nice
offwhite
foam
huge
pumpkin
pie
spice
aromas
cinnamon
clove
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
with
an
abundance
of
pumpkin
pie
flavors
along
with
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
a
little
caramel
and
some
warming
alcohol
which
helps
balance
things
out
a
little
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
too
much
but
this
one
is
probably
the
best
ive
had
so
far
i
have
been
told
to
try
dfh
and
southern
tier
now
to
just
hunt
them
down
i
wanted
to
try
this
one
last
year
not
sure
why
i
didnt
and
its
now
my
number
3
pumpkin
beer
i
typically
dont
like
weyerbacher
and
i
only
just
began
to
like
pumpkin
ales
so
here
we
go
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
color
orange
to
reddish
amber
with
a
two
finger
head
that
fades
to
a
white
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
is
spicy
the
cardamom
is
strongist
then
a
good
bit
of
clove
followed
by
the
rest
no
real
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
flavor
is
a
nice
fall
thing
good
malt
backbone
spices
and
yeah
for
sure
pumpkin
is
in
the
flavor
kinda
sharp
light
on
the
hops
good
great
body
though
thick
rich
great
carb
for
the
style
probably
my
favorite
part
of
the
beer
i
could
do
like
two
of
these
d
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
and
the
potent
side
8
abv
but
overall
a
good
pumpkin
ale
since
this
was
my
first
pumpkin
alenever
really
like
the
idea
of
a
pumpkin
ale
at
first
i
might
end
up
judging
others
based
on
this
but
only
those
that
are
of
the
imperial
variety
good
example
of
the
style
d
i
really
love
this
beer
nice
slow
drinker
to
be
enjoyed
and
savored
d
alcohol
is
hidden
well
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
but
not
my
favorite
had
me
feelin
good
before
i
went
out
to
party
will
hit
you
cheers
d
a
very
yummy
spicy
brew
that
i
imagine
gets
even
better
as
the
weather
cools
lots
of
big
flavors
and
akthough
8
isnt
terribly
high
its
a
smooth
drink
and
a
few
could
go
down
quick
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
and
would
be
great
with
a
holiday
meal
but
its
great
on
its
own
too
di
am
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
and
could
easily
have
another
of
these
eh
drinks
ok
i
would
rather
a
bit
more
beer
in
this
beer
d
nice
but
not
one
id
have
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
ouch
that
was
hard
i
wanted
so
badly
for
this
to
be
a
great
beer
but
i
do
understand
that
its
me
and
my
issue
with
cardamom
so
by
all
means
if
you
like
pumpkin
beer
give
it
a
shot
why
the
hell
not
stock
up
on
this
one
d
slightly
uneven
in
spots
but
still
a
drinkable
beer
d
very
disappointing
because
it
started
so
well
a
little
too
much
with
the
spices
and
the
texture
absolutely
killed
the
beer
for
me
the
only
thing
i
do
not
like
about
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
the
carbonation
it
is
a
bit
too
much
and
somewhat
prickly
on
the
tongue
this
does
go
down
smooth
and
i
would
place
it
among
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
but
thats
not
saying
much
since
good
ones
are
few
and
far
between
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
a
bit
pricey
would
i
buy
this
again
maybe
drinkability
not
awful
but
not
thrilling
the
bubblegum
taste
threw
me
off
the
entire
way
the
spice
is
on
point
but
most
everything
else
is
a
bit
distracting
however
im
willing
to
revisit
this
in
its
proper
season
i
e
not
august
d
i
would
definitely
try
this
beer
again
because
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
good
balance
between
the
flavors
d
while
its
stronger
on
alcohol
than
many
other
pumpkin
ales
its
still
nothing
that
gets
in
the
way
a
bit
of
a
stiffer
drink
is
what
you
might
want
on
a
cool
autumn
evening
anyway
this
one
has
changed
my
mind
on
pumpkin
ales
and
will
be
stocking
my
fridge
for
the
coming
months
really
has
a
beautiful
reddish
brown
color
that
has
a
huge
2
finger
foamy
head
with
excellent
lacing
has
a
beautiful
spicy
pumpkin
clove
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
aroma
really
inviting
taste
is
a
bit
dull
might
be
the
fact
that
i
am
drinking
this
on
a
hot
night
and
its
not
fall
lacking
body
though
it
does
have
some
great
complexities
of
sweet
pecans
dry
figs
and
bitter
cinnamon
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
also
as
i
was
expecting
a
much
heavier
brew
really
an
easy
drinking
beer
though
and
would
be
a
great
addition
to
some
light
gamey
meals
and
of
course
turkey
really
a
great
effort
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
drinkability
so
dangerously
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
beer
does
great
job
of
being
balanced
and
making
you
want
to
have
more
and
more
alcohol
is
well
hidden
to
the
extreme
i
very
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
for
sure
d
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
in
the
fall
duh
although
it
has
a
higher
abv
i
can
enjoy
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
weird
stuff
ultimately
pretty
decent
but
i
dont
ever
need
another
and
i
really
wonder
why
people
would
want
to
drink
this
around
halloween
really
wonder
d
the
alcohol
is
content
to
hide
in
the
background
making
this
a
supremely
drinkable
beer
i
plan
to
pick
up
a
few
six
packs
of
these
this
fall
to
celebrate
the
season
pours
a
deep
rubyorange
hybrid
color
with
some
nice
offwhite
foam
huge
pumpkin
pie
spice
aromascinnamon
clove
and
nutmeg
on
the
palate
much
of
the
same
with
an
abundance
of
pumpkin
pie
flavors
along
with
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
a
little

and
some
warming
alcohol
which
helps
balance
things
out
a
little
i
am
not
at
all
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
is
probably
the
best
ive
had
this
is
what
it
says
it
is
pumpkin
very
much
so
it
is
the
liquidalcohol
embodiment
of
a
pumpkin
pie
great
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
im
pleased
with
weyerbachers
take
on
style
and
i
would
gladly
take
down
a
six
pack
each
autumn
season
drinkability
i
love
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
could
use
more
pumpkin
flavor
and
a
little
less
spices
id
drink
this
again
but
still
prefer
the
st
pumking
as
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
this
is
a
damn
fin
pumpkin
ale
and
dangerously
drinkable
for
its
weight
the
peripherals
were
welldone
but
the
smoothness
and
balance
of
the
flavour
blew
me
away
its
certainly
in
the
pumpkin
pie
mold
of
this
style
so
if
that
appeals
to
you
then
weyerbacher
is
an
excellent
pick
very
tasty
very
interesting
while
i
love
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
imperial
versions
like
this
one
actually
seem
more
drinkable
to
me
which
could
be
a
dangerous
thing
like
this
one
on
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
brews
maybe
because
of
the
alcohol
and
the
cardamom
beer
looks
a
bright
kind
of
hazy
orange
with
a
creamy
head
i
attempt
to
carve
the
glass
but
am
stopped
by
the
bartender
who
politely
reminds
me
that
this
is
a
beer
and
not
an
actual
pumpkin
though
i
still
check
inside
for
seeds
the
smell
hits
me
with
the
pumpkin
flavour
right
away
then
the
ginger
nutmeg
coriander
and
all
the
other
wonderful
aromas
that
we
associate
with
nanas
homemade
pumpkin
pie
the
taste
does
not
disappoint
and
when
one
considers
the
abv
it
becomes
patently
obvious
that
weyerbacher
has
created
a
pumpkin
brew
is
a
head
above
the
rest
the
pumpkin
flavour
is
still
present
and
pleasant
and
all
the
other
previously
mention
spices
are
hanging
out
as
well
throwing
a
thanksgiving
party
in
my
mouth
the
high
abv
does
not
make
this
beer
any
less
wonderful
at
all
this
was
not
a
case
of
someone
simply
alcoholing
up
an
already
existing
recipe
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
and
the
full
feeling
of
the
flavours
makes
this
an
incredibly
enjoyable
experience
d
it
started
out
great
and
suffered
mildly
otherwise
not
for
being
bad
at
all
but
for
not
living
up
to
the
aroma
it
feels
too
thin
and
spicy
to
be
an
imperial
the
body
could
use
a
bit
of
work
but
if
you
paired
it
with
a
pumpkin
pie
it
would
be
great
good
drinkability
for
an
8
beer
though
im
not
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
but
the
imperial
caught
my
eye
and
i
had
to
have
a
glass
of
it
its
a
little
more
pumpkinny
than
i
like
so
it
was
a
little
hard
to
drink
but
i
think
the
higher
alcohol
by
volume
may
have
balanced
out
a
bit
great
color
good
carbonation
too
much
pumpkin
in
the
flavor
but
might
be
nice
when
the
weather
gets
worse
d
goes
down
very
easily
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
had
imperial
or
otherwise
id
drink
this
again
for
sure
overall
supreme
drinkabilty
this
pumpkin
ale
could
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
year
round
this
is
a
true
winner
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
good
example
for
the
style
and
the
alcohol
is
not
too
strong
im
not
sure
if
id
say
its
a
session
beer
just
because
i
feel
it
be
better
maybe
only
having
a
couple
at
a
time
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
cheers
d
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
but
not
sure
id
session
this
it
is
very
drinkable
considering
the
flavors
are
balanced
and
still
maintains
a
great
beer
flavor
with
the
roasted
maltiness
pours
a
deep
orange
translucent
very
little
carbonation
no
head
if
a
pumpkin
schnapps
existed
this
is
what
it
would
smell
like
pumpkin
and
liquor
taste
is
toasted
maltiness
mixed
with
a
cinnamon
sweetness
turning
quickly
to
pumpkins
and
alcohols
weyerbachers
got
some
high
octane
beers
but
sometimes
they
really
taste
like
it
also
that
is
definitely
the
case
with
this
one
finish
is
a
bit
rough
and
thin
d
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
at
8
abv
not
unexpected
drinkability
something
about
this
beer
does
not
do
it
for
me
the
packaging
is
attractive
a
cool
pumpkin
king
charging
ahead
but
the
beer
itself
is
kind
of
bland
the
mouth
is
crisp
yet
a
tad
wet
flavor
is
of
cheap
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
has
a
mineral
finish
that
fades
out
quickly
not
bad
here
the
alcohol
presence
is
hidden
pretty
well
i
got
through
this
one
easily
enough
recommend
i
think
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
it
is
big
that
is
for
sure
i
am
not
the
biggest
pumpkin
fan
but
i
try
them
all
and
i
can
respect
this
one
for
being
unique
in
its
ways
thanks
steve
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
d
as
i
said
before
this
beer
has
a
nice
mellow
pumpkin
pie
flavor
its
not
in
your
face
and
its
not
hidden
either
the
8
is
hardly
there
a
really
good
pumpkin
ale
brought
to
us
by
weyerbacher
poured
from
12
ounce
bottle
into
unibroue
tulip
brassy
color
with
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
and
no
lacing
aroma
is
of
candi
sugar
dark
molasses
and
pumpkin
spicepie
alcohol
is
well
hidden
pumpkin
taste
is
a
touch
bland
and
possibly
some
flavor
was
sacrificed
for
a
higher
alcohol
content
review
is
based
on
a
fresh
beer
perhaps
i
will
need
to
revisit
after
a
year
or
so
of
age
but
overall
a
great
beer
even
fresh
i
just
downed
3
of
these
and
a
glass
of
rombauer
zin
my
review
may
reflect
my
state
of
mind
that
being
said
this
review
is
from
the
heart
this
brew
is
fantastic
yet
dont
get
hung
up
on
a
particular
flavor
from
this
over
year
to
year
with
dogfish
i
see
consistency
this
bre
is
equal
in
quality
over
the
years
yet
subtle
essences
seem
to
change
a
nice
middle
ground
between
the
dogfish
and
southern
tier
pumpkin
ales
warm
copper
color
with
a
rocky
offwhite
head
that
falls
away
quickly
leaving
some
lace
clinging
to
the
edges
of
the
glass
smell
is
faint
compared
to
other
pumpkins
ive
had
lately
and
primarily
spice
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
taking
the
lead
great
flavor
on
this
one
with
the
spiciness
being
held
in
check
by
a
creamy
sweetness
almost
like
whipped
cream
on
pumpkin
pie
the
fruit
and
sweetness
come
first
with
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
following
and
leading
into
a
light
hopderived
drying
finish
feels
a
bit
sticky
in
the
mouth
and
a
semilow
carbonation
doesnt
help
issues
but
decent
nonetheless
this
is
one
of
the
more
palatable
pumpkins
ive
found
and
id
recommend
it
for
those
who
arent
crazy
about
the
super
spiciness
of
some
other
offerings
very
good
beer
in
general
let
alone
a
pumpkin
beer
bigger
body
than
the
other
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
the
carbonation
level
is
just
as
lively
without
being
disruptive
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
ale
id
place
it
between
ichabod
and
smuttynose
poured
a
clear
orange
body
with
decent
head
that
had
a
spicy
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
smell
along
with
some
sweet
malts
taste
the
spice
but
has
a
great
sweet
balance
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
that
goes
down
easy
as
usuall
weyerbacher
brews
a
excellent
pumpkin
alethis
is
my
2
pumpkin
ale
everyone
should
try
this
d
very
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
i
love
pumpkin
ales
and
this
is
one
of
the
few
that
is
big
on
pumpkin
pie
taste
but
also
on
balance
the
8
abv
is
very
well
hidden
as
well
its
a
big
beer
all
around
so
the
pumpkin
pie
flavors
could
get
overwhelming
after
a
couple
when
youre
working
with
a
handful
of
highly
seasoned
spices
an
extra
few
doses
of
alcohol
and
a
not
so
overly
appetizing
squash
as
your
flavour
base
its
easy
to
screw
things
up
this
beer
could
have
turned
out
to
be
a
giant
disaster
but
it
didnt
much
to
the
contrary
this
is
one
of
the
finer
pumpkin
ales
ive
come
across
recommended
poured
a
cloudy
reddishcopper
with
barely
any
head
and
not
much
lacing
the
smell
was
a
surprisingly
nice
mix
of
caramel
maltiness
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
cloves
the
flavor
revealed
all
of
these
dissolving
to
a
spritzy
alcohollaced
finish
followed
by
a
warm
spicy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
spritzy
given
the
visual
lack
of
carbonation
a
nicely
spiced
fall
seasonal
i
guess
i
remembered
this
better
than
it
was
this
goaround
an
aboveaverage
pumpkin
beer
but
then
there
are
a
lot
of
nasty
ones
worth
a
shot
on
a
cold
night
md
good
body
matches
the
style
easy
to
drink
better
than
some
others
in
the
style
but
i
still
havent
found
an
example
i
love
note
this
may
be
a
2008
batch
they
offer
no
dating
on
their
bottle
and
i
got
this
from
a
friend
in
august
2009
this
is
easily
in
my
top
three
of
pumpkin
beers
amber
in
color
with
a
nice
head
not
too
much
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
of
pumpkin
spice
and
sweet
malt
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
dominate
the
aroma
lots
of
spicy
flavor
tart
aftertaste
maybe
alittle
like
cider
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
bigger
then
most
overall
a
great
beer
i
get
it
every
year
drinkability
i
personally
find
this
the
best
pumpkin
ale
its
not
overly
sweet
or
generally
overdone
nicely
balanced
nicely
spiced
an
overal
well
done
fall
offering
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
for
the
style
hands
down
d
good
if
looking
for
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
would
search
this
one
out
wine
specialist104pack
i
love
the
look
of
this
beer
in
my
glass
orangered
in
color
very
small
lacing
around
the
glass
virtually
no
carbonation
bubbles
taking
a
big
wiff
im
definitely
picking
up
the
nutmeg
cinnamon
aromas
followed
with
a
faint
smell
of
pumpkin
spices
definitely
dominate
the
smell
my
tongue
is
picking
up
everything
i
was
smelling
with
the
addition
of
carbonation
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
immediately
at
the
end
theres
a
faint
zing
of
hops
followed
by
a
slight
boozy
warmth
but
not
much
and
the
flavors
dissipate
quickly
on
the
tongue
i
would
like
a
little
more
lingering
on
my
palate
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
and
weyerbacher
has
done
a
very
good
job
with
this
years
batch
overall
its
not
as
complex
and
bready
as
perhaps
a
few
other
pumpkin
ales
but
still
pretty
darn
good
the
weyerbacher
thirteen
is
insanely
complex
i
would
like
a
little
more
breadychewiness
as
the
mouthful
feels
a
tad
more
thin
than
what
id
prefer
for
this
style
not
overly
bready
or
hoppy
it
sits
in
between
hoppiness
and
sweetness
definitely
more
towards
the
sweet
side
im
appreciating
pumpkin
ales
more
and
this
is
one
i
could
have
a
few
of
in
one
sitting
however
the
alcohol
will
creep
up
on
you
quite
quickly
so
beware
sip
and
enjoy
i
am
a
fan
of
weyerbacher
but
will
stick
with
my
many
other
favorites
from
this
brewery
i
have
tasted
a
few
other
pumpkin
ales
and
do
not
think
this
is
the
best
example
however
if
you
like
lots
of
spice
you
may
go
for
this
one
i
couldnt
finish
this
one
just
way
too
boozy
and
alcoholic
a
shame
pours
a
translucent
coppery
goldenred
with
a
fairly
thick
yellowish
tan
head
aroma
is
mainly
of
cinnamon
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
spicy
malty
flavor
has
strong
overtone
of
cinnamon
and
undertone
of
pumpkin
texture
is
ragged
fizzy
and
jazzy
with
a
spicy
finish
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
a
nice
beer
to
try
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
clear
orange
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
smell
is
everything
you
expect
from
a
pumpkin
beercinamon
nutmeg
and
cloves
the
beer
is
sweet
just
like
liquid
pumpkin
pie
spice
the
brew
for
me
is
a
full
bodied
sipper
a
very
sweet
beer
imo
a
decent
dessert
beer
but
too
sweet
for
me
served
in
a
13
25
oz
tulip
it
has
a
dark
orangeruby
color
when
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
but
when
my
glass
is
resting
on
the
dark
table
it
looks
like
a
dark
brown
with
an
orange
glowvery
impressive
there
is
a
thin
tan
head
atop
the
beer
appropriately
it
has
a
strong
pumpkin
aroma
but
theres
also
some
spice
in
there
maybe
cloves
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
impressive
it
sneaks
up
on
you
starting
out
slow
and
finishing
with
a
flavor
that
lingers
after
you
swallow
the
beer
has
an
average
body
and
carbonation
nothing
exceptional
but
still
of
high
quality
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
the
only
strike
against
it
is
that
it
is
on
the
strong
side
a
few
too
many
of
these
could
be
dangerous
drinkability
is
high
as
this
beer
is
smooth
has
great
aromas
and
flavors
and
the
alcohol
bite
is
muted
in
the
face
of
the
other
flavors
overall
a
decent
beer
i
would
rather
have
a
dfh
punkin
or
a
st
pumking
but
this
beer
comes
in
at
third
hands
down
d
although
i
find
the
smell
a
bit
too
strong
the
mouthfeel
really
compensates
in
terms
of
overall
experience
and
leads
to
a
relatively
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
actually
very
nice
a
little
thin
but
refreshing
which
boosts
the
drinkability
drinkability
overall
its
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
that
i
would
recommend
however
not
sure
i
could
drink
a
good
amount
of
it
as
the
spices
are
very
powerful
and
the
pumpkin
isnt
always
that
strong
drinkability
is
good
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
12
oz
goes
down
relatively
easily
but
im
not
dying
to
have
another
overall
id
say
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
but
there
are
others
that
id
probably
prefer
over
this
one
d
pretty
nice
we
tasted
five
different
pumpkin
beers
this
evening
and
this
one
was
the
best
and
just
about
the
only
one
that
was
any
good
at
all
it
is
a
solid
well
balanced
base
beer
with
pleasant
hoppiness
the
spices
add
to
the
malt
but
the
beer
doesnt
depend
on
them
and
they
arent
over
the
top
a
better
than
average
example
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
like
sensory
overload
trying
to
feel
all
that
you
smell
is
taxing
it
leaves
my
cheeks
worn
out
halfway
through
my
12oz
pour
finishing
seems
a
daunting
task
though
awful
would
be
an
unfair
label
this
serving
may
prove
too
much
four
ounces
of
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
with
pecan
pie
would
be
a
very
nice
autumn
holiday
dessert
but
12
ounces
is
a
bit
much
d
drinks
easy
enough
for
8
but
the
spices
just
over
power
the
pumpkin
d
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
i
find
too
much
spice
overwhelming
having
said
that
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
i
may
even
be
able
to
have
two
d
this
becomes
a
little
much
after
awhile
but
imo
i
sort
of
want
that
out
of
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
d
would
for
sure
do
two
bottles
of
this
no
problem
punkin
ales
are
not
my
thing
unless
they
are
done
right
besides
the
other
two
weyerbacher
is
the
other
the
alc
is
a
bit
high
hindering
drinkability
a
bit
but
you
need
a
bit
more
abv
in
pumkin
ales
to
get
more
flavor
from
more
ingredients
this
one
is
made
with
care
overall
this
is
a
well
done
pumpkin
beer
worth
buying
again
absolutely
there
are
so
many
things
that
is
great
about
this
beer
malty
great
pumpkin
flavor
amazing
usage
of
spices
great
body
well
balance
a
smooth
drinking
beer
i
really
like
this
pumpkin
beer
from
weyerbacher
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried
dgood
stuff
big
beer
one
or
two
will
suffice
not
the
most
drinkable
pumpkin
in
the
world
but
that
doesnt
matter
much
as
i
am
not
a
person
who
can
knock
back
several
of
those
anyway
this
beer
is
easily
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
worth
trying
for
any
beer
fan
even
if
the
style
is
not
to
your
usual
fancy
drinkability
surprisingly
easy
going
down
for
a
spicy
imperial
overall
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
to
date
d
drinkable
but
not
to
much
at
one
time
leaves
a
pleasent
taste
in
the
mouth
overall
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
in
a
pumpkin
ale
that
is
not
just
a
spicy
brown
ale
i
really
like
this
its
right
up
there
with
dfh
punkin
southern
tier
pumking
is
still
my
favorite
and
i
have
yet
to
taste
anything
remotely
close
to
its
infused
pie
crusty
flavor
still
give
this
a
shot
it
is
very
good
d
i
could
probably
drink
two
of
these
and
then
want
to
move
to
something
a
little
less
spicy
as
is
usually
the
case
with
most
pumpkin
ales
i
drink
d
the
thinness
makes
this
easy
but
the
spice
makes
it
more
of
a
sipping
or
dessert
beer
for
me
overall
this
remains
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
although
in
a
perfect
world
id
like
it
a
bit
closer
to
6
as
i
dont
think
it
would
lose
much
flavor
either
way
its
worth
a
shot
d
pretty
darn
good
an
exceedingly
decent
pumpkin
beer
that
is
sadly
not
available
anywhere
near
chicago
service
type
tap
drinkability
normally
i
love
pumpkin
beer
but
this
beer
was
rather
disappointing
lots
of
spice
but
not
a
lot
of
pumpkin
i
have
read
previous
reviews
on
this
beer
and
it
has
been
said
that
a
bit
of
aging
may
tone
down
the
spice
and
make
the
beer
a
bit
more
balanced
i
have
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
so
i
hope
this
is
the
case
i
will
be
revisiting
this
beer
to
see
how
age
affects
it
but
i
dont
see
myself
ordering
this
one
on
tap
in
the
future
this
years
pumpkin
ale
is
absolutely
wonderful
nose
of
pumpkin
spice
mouthfeel
of
light
quenchable
flavourful
pumpkin
and
spices
added
to
the
already
brewed
ale
even
the
aftertaste
is
warming
yes
the
cinamon
nutmeg
cardamon
and
cloves
are
gently
incorporated
into
the
ale
giving
the
brew
a
gentle
spice
i
enjoy
the
pumpkins
beers
most
when
the
spices
arent
overwhelming
also
the
8
abv
is
a
welcoming
factor
wish
i
had
an
08
version
to
compare
side
by
side
drinkability
moderate
while
this
is
the
best
tasting
and
smelling
of
the
pumpkin
ales
im
definitely
feeling
a
bit
of
the
8
abv
so
i
think
if
were
to
try
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
it
would
really
have
to
be
spaced
out
over
the
course
of
an
entire
afternoonevening
its
a
great
tasting
beer
though
and
perfect
for
the
season
especially
that
warming
aspect
as
that
would
be
great
for
a
nice
cool
and
crisp
autumn
evening
a
really
well
done
pumpkin
ale
thats
not
too
overthetop
on
the
spices
but
to
be
honest
the
spices
are
what
i
like
about
a
pumpkin
ale
so
this
one
doesnt
really
hit
the
mark
for
me
definately
good
but
id
like
a
little
more
spice
if
youre
looking
for
a
pumpkin
ale
that
doesnt
make
you
feel
like
its
liquid
pumpkin
pie
then
this
would
be
a
good
choice
d
the
high
abv
along
with
very
present
spices
make
this
one
not
as
drinkable
as
a
lot
of
other
pumpkins
out
there
bottle
pours
a
moderate
head
atop
a
thick
luminescent
body
of
red
brick
and
tree
dark
color
nose
is
full
of
pumpkin
spice
flavor
is
largely
of
the
same
with
a
stronger
emphasis
on
pumpkin
spice
than
cinnamon
characteriized
by
some
of
its
competitors
not
creamy
in
any
way
has
something
like
a
faint
spearmint
aftertaste
that
doesnt
entirely
fit
in
it
is
extremely
faint
but
doesnt
help
motivate
me
to
order
another
d
perfect
for
the
fall
but
i
dont
think
i
could
do
more
than
1
or
2
d
interesting
complexity
for
a
pumpkin
ale
love
the
floral
ginger
d
although
im
more
a
pumpkin
pie
flavor
guy
this
is
the
best
spice
leaning
brew
decent
carbonation
pumpkin
flavor
carries
through
to
the
end
finish
is
a
touch
tart
and
sweet
but
finishes
ok
this
is
a
strong
ale
alcoholwise
but
doesnt
possess
enough
maltiness
to
be
considered
an
imperial
ale
notes
really
nice
example
of
the
style
along
with
st
pumking
this
is
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
had
weyerbacher
is
a
great
brewery
d
the
8
abv
is
noticable
and
the
alcohol
heat
might
scare
off
some
as
well
as
the
very
different
taste
and
smell
to
this
beer
still
quite
enjoyable
full
mouthfeel
even
carbonation
faint
warming
average
drinkability
a
little
too
sweet
and
perfumey
i
personally
think
this
ale
is
much
more
well
balanced
and
even
more
of
a
beer
than
pumpking
moreys
bottom
line
last
year
i
sampled
dogfish
punkin
and
new
holland
ichabod
and
i
like
this
better
than
both
of
them
hope
to
review
a
southern
tier
pumking
here
soon
cheers
drinkabilityfor
8
hell
yeah
mouthfeel
is
disgustingly
carbonated
and
hot
on
the
palate
the
drinkability
may
soon
breach
absolute
zero
which
will
be
a
breakthrough
for
science
but
a
catastrophe
for
the
craft
beer
industry
with
every
sip
this
brew
sets
back
the
world
of
beer
at
least
10
years
in
its
development
absolutely
awful
notes
this
is
quite
a
showoff
for
pumpkin
ales
it
matches
its
imperial
label
rather
well
and
is
a
pleasure
to
have
and
introduce
to
pumpkin
beer
skeptics
d
i
love
pumpkin
beers
and
this
one
is
outstanding
to
me
a
pumpkin
ale
is
the
perfect
compliment
to
a
crisp
and
cool
fall
day
weyerbacher
crafted
a
drinkable
and
flavorfull
brew
with
this
one
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
d
this
is
not
a
beer
for
guzzling
after
youve
mown
the
lawn
it
would
make
a
terrific
afterdinner
beer
for
a
holiday
event
or
a
sipper
for
enjoying
during
a
quiet
evening
with
your
better
half
the
8
was
very
well
hiddeni
could
have
had
these
all
night
id
certainly
be
interested
in
picking
up
a
few
bottles
of
my
own
an
excellent
pumpkin
ale
still
the
spices
and
heaviness
of
the
malt
tend
to
keep
drinkability
at
a
minimal
level
tasting
notes
if
you
love
highly
spiced
ales
with
cardamom
as
i
do
my
favorite
warmer
is
snowbound
then
you
are
sure
to
like
this
this
is
the
poster
child
for
the
style
and
is
hands
down
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
pumpkin
ales
really
should
be
enjoyed
at
higher
gravities
like
winter
warmers
this
really
is
a
treat
final
thoughts
another
one
of
those
wicked
yes
im
from
ma
overspiced
pumkin
beers
its
pretty
water
spicey
and
extract
tasting
another
beer
from
weyerbacher
im
not
very
happy
about
i
should
write
them
and
complain
better
yet
ill
start
a
ba
thread
the
taste
is
right
on
par
with
the
scent
the
pumpkin
pie
filling
takes
the
cake
and
is
well
matched
with
a
slightly
roasted
biscuit
malt
taste
more
sweet
then
anything
and
the
cinnamon
comes
out
very
well
with
out
being
too
over
the
top
this
beer
like
most
pumpkin
ales
is
rather
thin
which
comes
as
a
surprise
given
the
higher
then
average
abv
regardless
i
could
drink
this
all
day
this
will
be
my
fall
beer
of
choice
when
in
doubt
definitely
one
of
the
better
if
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
cant
wait
to
have
more
of
these
especially
when
the
leaves
start
to
turn
bye
this
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
cinnamon
and
slight
pumpkin
the
taste
starts
off
mellow
with
malt
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of
hops
and
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
overall
this
beer
is
nice
and
is
extremely
drinkable
and
i
am
glad
that
it
is
8
that
being
said
there
is
not
really
much
on
the
pumpkin
side
if
you
want
to
try
a
true
pumpkin
beer
go
with
the
southern
tier
pumpking
ale
that
beer
will
knock
your
socks
off
3
5
d
good
beer
but
could
have
more
body
to
back
up
the
spices
overall
a
very
great
smelling
and
enjoyable
fall
beer
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
another
but
i
would
prefer
less
carbonation
notes
everything
seemed
o
k
but
the
spices
just
seemed
to
stay
put
on
the
cinnamon
perhaps
i
am
missing
something
heremaybe
it
was
where
i
got
the
growler
who
knowsbut
i
will
add
that
this
was
not
a
bad
beerjust
seemed
off
balance
drinkability
horrible
pumpkin
beer
avergae
overall
beer
cheers
drinkability
is
good
this
tasting
was
a
bit
aged
i
would
love
to
try
it
again
with
a
fresher
bottle
medium
to
low
carbonation
medium
body
a
very
nice
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
alcohol
not
really
noticeable
at
all
until
the
very
end
very
drinkable
for
a
spicy
pumpkin
beer
i
could
easily
drink
these
all
night
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
great
abv
for
the
style
also
in
my
opinion
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
to
date
granted
this
is
the
first
one
ive
had
in
months
and
not
one
of
my
most
favorite
styles
but
the
similarity
to
pumpkin
pie
is
like
no
other
this
is
definately
a
must
try
for
any
beer
drinker
also
im
very
impressed
with
this
brewery
and
what
they
have
to
offer
all
there
beers
are
very
good
good
sweet
aftertaste
kinda
thin
but
still
a
good
beer
tom
barrasso
larry
murphy
ulf
samuelsson
and
kevin
stevens
were
all
penguins
one
of
the
better
pumpkins
around
d
this
ale
was
the
real
deal
though
my
favorite
in
the
style
is
st
pumking
and
this
is
not
as
good
as
that
imo
its
a
good
choice
for
those
who
like
pumpkin
ale
well
made
and
dangerously
drinkable
for
the
big
abv
drinkability
lots
of
evident
alcohol
and
overpowering
spice
make
this
one
a
beer
ive
had
enough
of
after
this
first
22
oz
bottle
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
it
pours
amber
with
a
very
thin
head
there
is
little
to
no
lacing
it
smells
of
nutmeg
cloves
and
cinnamon
the
is
easy
on
the
palate
and
masks
the
alcohol
very
well
i
feel
that
it
is
much
better
on
draught
but
is
still
solid
from
the
bottle
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
wants
to
try
a
pumpkin
beer
tastes
of
oppressive
halloween
spices
spicy
aftertaste
hangs
around
for
a
moment
then
tastes
funky
nasty
some
sweet
orange
candy
malt
underneath
becomes
noticeable
as
the
beer
warms
up
needs
more
pumpkinorange
flavor
to
balance
such
heavy
spice
d
unless
halloween
not
much
there
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
weve
tried
highly
recommended
if
you
need
a
cardamom
fix
i
like
pumpkin
ales
when
theyre
done
right
i
like
imperial
stuff
in
general
this
one
hits
both
notes
with
great
resonance
smooth
and
drinkable
this
one
is
definitely
a
winner
its
still
a
pumpkin
ale
if
you
hate
pumpkin
beer
this
one
still
isnt
for
you
if
youre
on
the
fence
this
just
may
be
the
one
to
tip
you
notes
very
pumpkiny
enjoyable
and
a
great
october
brew
this
is
a
beer
that
insinuates
itself
in
your
palate
and
good
graces
it
started
way
over
the
top
with
the
pumpkin
and
spices
but
mellowed
nicely
or
at
least
my
sensibilities
softened
to
really
appreciate
this
beer
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
with
a
touch
of
orange
the
nose
is
pure
pumpkin
and
what
i
call
a
medley
of
holiday
spices
there
is
a
touch
of
abv
in
the
nose
as
well
the
beer
is
fairly
medium
bodied
slight
carbonation
but
not
much
it
begins
with
a
huge
blast
of
pumpkin
and
this
then
segues
into
the
spicy
notes
lots
of
nutmeg
cardoman
cinnamon
some
clove
there
are
some
biting
hints
in
the
finish
perhaps
from
some
hop
which
isnt
really
a
factor
the
bite
may
come
from
the
cinnamon
more
than
any
of
the
other
holiday
like
spices
the
beer
has
some
warming
booziness
but
this
is
just
a
robust
pumpkin
ale
if
there
ever
was
one
it
would
seem
i
prefer
my
pumpkin
ales
this
way
sweeter
and
spicier
just
like
the
pumpkin
bread
i
ate
along
with
it
drinkability
a
sipping
beer
given
the
spice
flavors
probably
good
for
one
a
night
but
it
was
easy
to
have
another
the
next
night
this
is
an
occasional
beer
that
is
easy
to
consume
if
you
like
pumpkin
pie
but
if
you
dont
care
a
lot
for
pumpkin
pie
give
this
one
a
pass
this
beer
is
much
easier
to
drink
than
a
lot
of
other
pumpkin
ales
that
are
way
too
spiced
the
slight
alcohol
presence
is
nice
and
theres
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
from
getting
syrupy
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
the
abv
drinkability
well
i
think
it
is
time
i
admit
that
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
always
having
been
a
follower
of
beer
seasons
i
tend
to
grab
pumpkin
ales
when
i
see
them
but
i
think
i
need
to
stop
that
this
is
a
complex
and
well
done
beer
but
not
for
me
out
of
a
bottle
his
beer
was
a
perfectly
clear
cherry
wood
color
the
head
was
two
fingers
of
tan
foam
that
displayed
nice
retention
as
a
collar
and
left
solid
lacing
the
aroma
was
delicious
strong
pumpkins
allspice
nutmeg
some
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
hop
bitterness
the
flavors
were
a
complex
rush
like
a
good
nfl
defense
first
a
flash
of
sweetness
quickly
followed
by
a
punch
of
alcohol
heat
this
then
became
pumpkin
pulp
wood
hints
of
nuts
nutmeg
cloves
and
hints
of
cinnamon
all
built
on
a
caramel
malt
backbone
the
finish
was
balanced
with
enough
hops
and
the
overall
effect
was
impressive
but
not
overwhelming
the
body
was
medium
the
mouthfeel
smooth
and
the
mouthfeel
perfect
once
again
a
stunning
offering
from
this
topnotch
operation
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
pumpkin
pie
exploads
i
wanna
throw
some
cool
whip
up
on
it
drinkability
an
interesting
concept
but
i
would
like
to
see
more
pumpkin
flavor
to
match
the
spices

at
any
rate
the
flavor
was
delicious
not
too
overbearing
on
the
spice
notes
but
they
were
still
forward
enough
to
continue
noting
them
over
the
course
of
the
pint
a
very
worthy
pumpkin
ale
even
if
you
dont
like
the
style
check
it
out
as
the
spices
are
balanced
and
mild
lots
of
reds
and
oranges
dance
in
the
light
it
looks
like
an
oaked
arrogant
bastard
and
thats
where
the
similarities
end
this
was
a
tasty
treat
actually
and
i
dont
usually
want
to
have
more
than
a
sample
taste
of
a
pumpkin
beer
the
aroma
is
heavy
with
spice
too
much
so
but
i
chose
to
drink
this
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
because
i
wanted
something
a
little
overthetop
well
it
delivered
right
up
my
nose
very
spicy
on
the
palate
as
well
tongue
tingling
alcohol
mixed
with
an
overspiced
pumpkin
pie
lots
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
maybe
pumpkin
pie
filling
straight
from
the
can
after
what
seems
like
a
lot
of
complaining
i
actually
like
this
concoction
not
for
everyday
consumption
but
a
much
better
example
than
most
of
the
easily
found
pumpkins
on
the
market
id
have
another
next
fall
sharp
cinnamon
nutmeg
pumpkin
aroma
sharp
spicy
flavors
mirrors
aroma
with
a
mild
canned
pumpkin
taste
on
a
weak
malt
base
more
spice
than
pumpkin
flavors
here
too
bad
hazy
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
light
to
medium
body
with
a
watery
texture
overall
this
beer
could
be
a
litte
bit
less
boozy
and
use
some
more
body
however
its
decent
enough
for
such
a
big
pumpkin
beer
bottle
i
love
this
label
that
pumpkin
seems
really
pissed
and
yet
ready
to
party
big
time
pours
out
a
bright
amber
almost
orange
color
with
a
initially
large
foamy
head
that
goes
down
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
is
loads
of
spices
definitely
a
lot
of
pumpkins
in
the
nose
also
a
smooth
and
warm
taste
sweet
pumpkin
and
loads
of
spices
the
nutmeg
really
stood
out
a
smooth
and
medium
to
thin
body
very
enjoyable
i
did
a
threeway
blind
pumpkin
ale
taste
test
yesterday
with
this
dogfish
head
and
smuttynose
this
was
clearly
without
question
the
best
of
the
three
i
have
all
three
again
today
and
completely
agree
with
my
blind
taste
test
dogfish
is
solid
but
not
close
to
this
one
smutty
doesnt
compare
d
for
a
pumpkin
beer
its
not
bad
the
smell
is
a
bit
knockout
worthy
imo
but
the
taste
is
far
more
subtle
helps
the
beer
be
bearable
i
actually
thought
about
having
another
after
this
one
so
i
guess
that
says
something
not
bad
and
another
solid
brew
from
weyerbacher
great
for
the
holiday
season
md
very
drinkable
for
a
pumpkin
beer
i
want
to
be
a
fan
of
the
style
but
just
cant
bring
myself
to
it
but
this
one
is
definitely
one
i
will
have
year
after
year
this
beer
almost
perfectly
balances
the
interplay
between
the
pumpkin
and
the
spices
i
sense
almost
no
hop
presence
no
bitterness
in
the
least
the
focus
is
on
the
malt
and
pumpkinspice
balance
ive
had
some
pumpkin
beers
where
all
you
can
taste
is
the
spice
completely
overwhelming
the
beer
not
here
the
pumpkin
taste
comes
out
a
little
more
in
the
lingering
aftertaste
so
i
look
forward
to
many
a
pumpkin
burp
the
high
level
of
carbonation
makes
this
pretty
easy
to
drink
it
is
a
little
sticky
in
the
throat
however
detracting
a
bit
from
the
feel
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
the
smell
is
the
best
part
but
the
total
package
will
not
disappoint
drinkability
a
filling
beer
that
goes
perfectly
with
the
cold
rainy
fall
nights
only
con
after
drinking
about
two
or
three
i
have
had
my
feel
of
pumpkin
and
spices
good
sized
head
although
it
is
a
bit
weak
in
volume
very
strong
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
clove
aromas
which
almost
overpower
the
pumpkin
flavor
ive
toured
the
brewery
and
saw
this
being
made
they
use
real
pumpkin
so
there
is
some
serious
flavor
here
there
is
a
delightful
spice
pervading
the
combination
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
cloves
and
cardamom
these
added
spices
give
a
strong
chailike
feel
to
the
beer
perfect
with
a
dessert
on
a
cold
winters
night
weyerbacher
has
done
it
again
the
pumpkin
taste
is
delicious
like
pumpkin
pie
but
leaves
the
palette
quickly
and
is
replaced
with
a
stale
aftertaste
d
this
one
is
disappearing
way
too
quickly
excellent
beer
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
this
and
its
the
one
i
go
for
come
pumpkin
season
which
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
i
guess
i
stray
from
the
norm
here
cause
i
really
could
hang
out
with
a
6
pack
of
this
throughout
an
evening
pours
a
reddish
copper
with
a
thick
tan
head
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
all
are
present
in
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
fullbodied
spices
are
apparent
in
the
forefront
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
cardamon
pumpkin
flavor
comes
through
and
combines
with
a
nice
malty
backbone
to
create
a
satisfying
fall
pumpkin
beer
at
8
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
a
little
in
the
finish
but
not
overpowering
a
pretty
decent
pumpkin
ale
that
balances
the
spice
and
pumpkin
flavor
nicely
with
a
solid
malt
presence
slightly
bitter
flavor
dry
like
a
stick
of
gum
from
a
pack
of
baseball
cards
sort
of
astringent
even
not
really
holding
my
attention
earthy
vegetal
pumpkin
note
however
the
drying
finish
isnt
very
pleasant
no
malt
sweetness
more
straight
up
squashiness
its
ok
not
one
id
return
to
pumpking
is
still
the
reigning
champion
bottle
from
capones
in
norristown
pa
saved
for
halloween
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
short
orangewhite
head
laces
weakly
but
in
a
sticky
way
smells
strongly
of
nutmeg
and
cloves
as
well
as
a
hint
of
alcohol
definitely
captures
the
pumpkin
pie
odor
well
taste
is
similarly
heavy
on
the
cloves
and
nutmeg
slightly
dry
with
a
bit
of
a
warming
alcohol
on
the
back
end
cloves
are
stronger
than
perhaps
is
warranted
but
not
overwhelming
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
and
a
bit
sticky
it
does
get
kind
of
old
as
one
gets
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
better
to
share
this
one
i
did
actually
but
my
wife
didnt
like
it
drinkability
is
high
though
i
wouldnt
want
to
session
this
beer
it
makes
a
great
dessert
beer
or
as
im
doing
a
nice
finish
to
a
halloween
evening
while
i
watch
a
vincent
price
movie
deep
coppery
orange
with
a
bubbly
creamy
head
heavy
spices
in
the
aroma
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
ginger
over
a
faded
sweet
malt
base
fruity
sweet
caramel
flavor
the
spices
are
much
more
mellow
allowing
some
hops
to
come
through
very
smooth
some
clove
and
pumpkin
comes
through
in
the
finish
slick
creamy
body
with
a
bit
of
warmth
good
nothing
exciting
though
goes
down
nicely
could
drink
this
all
night
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
seek
this
one
out
as
a
pumpkin
beer
this
would
probably
score
a
3
53
7
but
as
something
that
i
would
like
to
drink
im
thinking
4
3ish
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
pours
with
some
viscosity
noted
hazed
ruby
red
appearance
thin
beige
head
sparse
lace
great
aroma
of
caramel
malts
sweet
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
first
thing
i
notice
is
a
nice
full
body
good
feel
in
the
mouth
lightly
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
even
given
the
8
av
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticed
what
is
noticed
is
a
nice
blend
between
the
malt
pumpkin
and
spices
the
label
says
cloves
are
here
but
im
not
getting
a
lot
of
clove
which
is
good
in
my
book
i
get
some
earthy
nutmeg
tones
and
cinnamon
of
course
the
sweetness
of
malt
and
pumpkin
blend
very
nicely
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
beer
that
needs
a
few
minutes
out
of
the
fridge
before
serving
it
helps
the
smell
and
taste
come
thru
better
drinkability
i
would
have
a
few
with
no
problems
get
these
before
the
season
ends
recommended
yesterday
i
was
at
wegmans
and
happened
across
their
beer
and
food
pairing
event
they
were
doing
something
rather
interesting
with
the
pumpkin
ale
making
a
float
with
vanilla
ice
cream
it
was
quite
a
delicious
and
simple
treat
the
sweetness
of
the
ice
cream
quenched
the
spiciness
of
the
ale
just
slightly
i
was
impressed
i
would
highly
suggest
giving
this
a
shot
drinkability
very
enjoyable
beer
i
was
not
left
wanting
more
flavor
andor
spices
would
seek
out
again
next
fall
d
my
favourite
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
the
fact
that
i
cant
get
this
within
2000
miles
of
me
is
a
crime
great
fall
beer
overall
best
pumpkin
beer
out
there
i
have
had
i
have
not
had
pumking
this
is
a
good
beer
and
not
just
a
good
pumpkin
beer
not
something
i
would
drink
often
but
a
very
fun
seasonal
one
a
season
should
do
it
well
put
together
package
with
the
label
and
pie
aromas
screams
halloween
tasty
serving
type
on
tap
d
solid
pumpkin
but
falls
well
short
of
pumking
or
punkin
an
interesting
brew
being
an
imperial
version
of
the
quintessential
american
fall
brew
but
the
strong
spiciness
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming
and
the
alcohol
can
at
times
be
a
turnoff
still
a
good
beer
not
a
real
heavy
imperial
but
i
think
the
four
pack
sits
about
right
for
a
workday
night
this
beer
is
amazing
its
worth
spending
20
dollars
on
a
six
pack
for
the
limited
releases
of
it
it
is
even
good
flat
you
cant
buy
a
better
pumpkin
beer
seriously
d
light
enough
to
drink
quite
a
few
but
i
surely
wouldnt
want
too
awful
expensive
for
such
a
subpar
brew
i
would
never
purchase
again
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
unlike
some
others
that
lack
certain
characteristics
that
leave
you
seeking
more
flavor
and
aroma
this
one
hits
the
mark
i
will
enjoy
more
imperial
pumpkins
in
the
future
smelled
as
expected
typical
spices
and
nothing
that
snuck
up
on
you
worthy
of
having
a
bottle
or
two
when
the
season
comes
around
overall
i
thought
this
brew
was
pretty
good
the
flavors
and
smells
are
all
there
i
paired
it
with
pad
thai
and
krab
rangoon
awesome
note
great
bottle
label
an
angry
pumkin
warrior
is
featured
and
is
one
of
the
better
graphics
ive
seen
in
a
while
d
this
beer
was
a
miss
for
me
if
youre
into
super
spiced
beer
then
youll
probably
dig
this
one
its
worth
a
try
if
youve
not
had
this
one
before
but
overall
its
a
pretty
average
beer
cheers
call
me
pleasantly
surprised
this
years
is
definitely
better
than
i
remember
it
for
sure
ill
be
trying
it
again
next
year
and
maybe
again
this
year
too
looked
a
bit
drab
compared
to
others
in
the
style
more
brown
than
expected
the
smell
was
obvious
for
the
class
but
not
as
complex
as
others
the
cinnamon
was
light
and
after
nutmeg
i
did
not
notice
much
after
that
where
is
the
coriander
taste
followed
the
lead
of
smell
sort
of
bland
really
some
spice
but
i
did
not
notice
much
in
the
way
of
pumpkin
flavors
i
did
not
ask
the
abv
but
correctly
guessed
it
low
for
an
imperial
mouthfeel
was
flat
and
uninspiring
really
drinkable
average
d
this
is
quite
a
tasty
pumpkin
ale
for
sure
but
its
got
nothing
on
southern
tier
pumking
with
that
said
the
is
probably
the
second
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
lets
see
how
this
measures
up
to
the
upcoming
selins
grove
pumpkin
ale
in
a
few
weeks
drinkability
more
of
an
autumn
ale
than
a
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
is
dominated
by
more
of
a
spice
taste
then
a
pumpkin
one
also
the
mouthfeel
and
aftertaste
of
this
beer
are
not
very
good
nevertheless
this
is
a
mildly
refreshing
autumn
beer
that
wouldnt
taste
bad
on
a
warm
autumn
day
if
you
like
spiced
beer
check
this
one
out
im
liking
the
drinkability
the
abv
isnt
present
you
can
feel
it
a
little
in
the
tongue
but
nothing
big
this
beer
is
beer
as
it
warms
edit
i
think
this
beer
is
much
better
than
i
said
last
time
and
am
editing
the
scores
to
show
as
much
d
if
youre
into
spice
this
is
a
brew
for
you
the
alcohol
in
this
one
is
moderately
high
but
doesnt
really
shine
through
much
until
afterward
overall
id
say
this
is
a
tasty
wellbalanced
beer
id
be
curious
to
compare
it
to
other
pumpkin
ales
but
im
pretty
happy
with
this
one
this
isnt
something
id
sit
down
and
drink
often
but
i
was
curious
about
it
had
it
and
was
happy
alright
drinkability
moderate
to
low
high
alcohol
and
cloyingness
prevent
consuming
more
then
a
couple
mfd
im
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
infused
beer
in
general
but
if
you
are
this
one
is
definitely
a
quality
product
imperial
pumpkin
is
a
luxurious
exquisite
pumpkin
ale
that
is
a
must
try
for
fans
of
the
style
but
i
feel
its
too
rich
for
serious
sessioning
eric
they
really
hid
the
abv
well
as
its
the
spices
not
any
alcohol
burn
that
give
you
a
warming
sensation
a
perfect
relaxdessert
beer
d
not
bad
since
we
dont
have
st
brews
in
florida
this
one
will
have
to
satisfy
my
pumpkin
fix
it
is
the
next
best
thing
in
my
opinion
that
being
said
the
distance
between
this
and
pumking
is
great
d
you
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
or
two
but
a
perfectly
good
nonpumpkinsoda
pumpkin
ale
if
pressed
i
prefer
punkin
ale
but
really
its
pretty
close
punkin
is
more
like
the
whole
pumpkin
pie
complete
with
big
spices
and
whipped
cream
this
one
is
like
the
raw
plain
pumpkin
pie
filling
with
a
bigger
pure
pumpkin
character
both
excellent
and
satisfying
i
will
drink
this
again
d
the
boldness
of
this
brew
makes
a
bomber
of
it
enough
but
man
is
it
well
constructed
theres
not
the
pumpkin
element
present
in
some
others
of
the
style
but
the
spice
profile
is
amazing
its
difficult
to
really
nail
even
a
couple
of
spices
in
a
beer
but
weyerbacher
has
done
a
seamless
job
of
getting
4
big
boys
together
incredible
stuff
cheers
a
dark
clear
copper
in
color
with
a
fairly
scant
offwhite
head
and
modest
lacing
the
aroma
is
butterscotchnut
and
licorice
alcohol
very
complex
and
impressive
the
taste
is
a
somewhat
thin
bodied
mild
brandy
and
root
beer
licorice
pumpkin
and
lots
of
cinnamon
the
carbonation
is
subtle
and
its
drinkability
seems
minimal
to
my
tastebuds
very
interesting
but
not
something
i
will
likely
revisit
anytime
soon
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
brewit
looked
great
and
smelled
wonderful
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
ill
routinely
seek
out
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
i
bought
this
4pack
at
discount
liquor
in
milwaukee
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
it
keeps
a
handle
on
the
spices
which
makes
this
much
more
drinkable
than
others
of
the
style
dogfish
head
punkin
ale
is
still
king
of
the
mountain
when
it
comes
to
pumpkin
ales
for
me
but
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
version
by
weyerbacher
just
to
get
a
glimpse
at
that
high
abv
pull
no
punches
flavor
theyve
built
a
reputation
on
had
this
one
with
the
poker
pals
moxley
and
hyland
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
a
cloudy
iced
tea
brown
with
orange
hues
smelled
like
my
oh
my
sweet
pumkin
pie
cinamon
nutmeg
and
cloves
tasted
like
the
smell
sweet
and
crisp
with
no
heavy
alcohol
taste
and
was
surprisingly
smooth
light
and
mildly
carbonated
with
more
spices
more
prominent
as
it
warms
i
was
not
expecting
to
like
this
at
all
but
i
did
no
doubt
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
tried
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
into
the
glass
with
a
bit
of
a
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
goes
away
almost
instantly
it
is
a
fairly
clear
amber
color
this
one
definitely
smells
like
a
pumpkin
pie
there
is
no
mistaking
it
for
anything
else
the
taste
is
quite
good
the
cinnamon
and
other
pumpkin
pie
spices
are
fight
upfront
but
not
overdone
some
sweetness
coming
up
through
the
spices
it
has
a
very
clean
taste
but
not
light
i
like
this
one
whoa
there
are
some
bigtime
flavors
lurking
in
this
one
spices
blast
the
palate
first
with
white
pepper
and
cinnamonrich
pumpkin
notes
leading
the
way
this
transitions
to
veggyrich
pumpkin
pulp
and
caramel
malts
that
get
quickly
demolished
by
a
brash
occupancy
of
ethanol
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
thinner
than
expected
while
the
boozy
finish
is
hot
and
leaves
the
tongue
a
bit
too
dry
imperial
pumpkin
started
out
promising
but
falls
a
bit
flat
in
the
tastemouthfeel
department
nevertheless
it
does
hold
up
as
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
this
fall
highly
recommended
for
fans
of
fall
seasonals
weyerbacher
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
deep
redorange
thin
head
not
much
for
retention
lots
of
pumpkin
spices
in
the
nose
allspice
cinnamon
cloves
touch
of
vanilla
smells
translate
nicely
into
the
taste
but
big
juicy
pumpkin
flavor
is
the
really
nice
part
not
bad
slick
smooth
mouthfeel
i
really
cant
recommend
this
other
reviews
seem
pretty
favorable
so
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
the
rest
of
this
one
is
going
down
the
drain
smooth
and
clean
well
balanced
flavors
alcohol
well
hidden
seems
to
be
a
very
well
made
pumpin
ale
i
understand
this
is
a
pumpkin
ale
but
it
tastes
a
lot
like
a
winter
warmer
not
whats
expected
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
smooth
and
velvety
on
the
palate
carbonation
does
not
intrude
at
all
it
is
so
light
in
feel
that
it
is
barely
noticeable
the
body
of
this
beer
is
full
and
thick
not
full
though
like
a
doppelbock
not
chewy
like
that
but
it
is
full
as
in
heavy
creamy
and
smooth
this
is
one
that
i
could
seriously
drink
all
day
give
me
a
cool
fall
day
outside
and
im
there
counting
leaves
that
fall
from
the
trees
the
finish
on
this
one
is
semidry
leaving
some
of
the
spice
flavor
behind
which
seems
to
dry
out
the
palate
get
your
hands
on
this
one
if
you
can
this
is
one
that
ill
be
buying
again
that
is
granted
i
can
find
it
had
to
travel
to
my
hometown
of
stow
oh
to
get
this
one
theres
only
a
few
that
ive
had
better
than
this
in
terms
of
pumpkin
ales
and
two
of
those
would
be
homebrewed
that
i
made
about
a
year
ago
not
to
flaunt
my
prowess
since
i
think
that
it
was
pure
luck
that
i
picked
numbers
and
percentages
for
my
grist
bill
too
bad
i
didnt
write
down
exactly
how
much
of
each
spice
i
used
hindsight
is
better
than
foresight
always
use
a
scale
to
measure
things
if
you
love
pumpkin
ales
as
i
do
get
your
hands
on
this
one
its
fucking
great
d
the
beer
is
the
very
enjoyable
similar
to
you
guessed
it
pie
it
was
a
lot
of
fun
and
a
great
experience
for
an
ipa
however
i
could
only
drink
one
in
a
sitting
for
what
weyerbacher
set
out
to
produce
they
nailed
it
now
if
you
dont
like
spice
or
alcohol
flavors
steer
clear
but
if
you
do
this
one
will
rock
you
being
very
close
to
the
brewery
we
always
get
a
nice
batch
and
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
me
at
all
very
good
pumpkin
beer
which
some
may
consider
an
oxymoron
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
will
be
seeking
this
out
more
as
the
season
wears
on
had
on
tap
at
the
sunset
cantina
the
drink
had
a
great
goldorange
balance
with
a
creamy
head
and
some
nice
lacing
aromas
were
incredible
and
rich
in
their
pumpkin
and
spice
flavoring
the
taste
was
a
little
weaker
than
the
aroma
had
you
going
for
slight
metallic
hints
in
each
sip
with
less
spice
than
what
expected
still
pretty
heavy
on
the
pumpkin
flavoring
excellently
crisp
and
refreshing
with
the
sweet
pumpkin
taste
overall
a
really
good
pumpkin
ale
the
abv
is
well
hidden
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
only
bristols
dfh
seem
better
to
me
recommended
d
drinkability
is
pretty
high
for
a
pumpkin
beer
with
8
abv
this
thing
is
really
tasty
and
hides
the
abv
quite
well
this
could
be
a
dangerous
one
but
its
not
like
youre
going
to
session
it
or
are
you
r0x0rz
pretty
hard
and
highly
recommended
if
youre
in
the
market
for
a
pumpkin
beer
this
autumn
glad
to
know
i
have
something
else
to
buy
along
with
punkin
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
one
of
the
top
pumpkin
beers
i
will
seek
this
out
again
it
is
pricey
but
unique
this
is
a
good
fall
beer
but
i
will
buy
more
dogfish
head
punkin
before
this
again
overall
this
is
a
great
autumn
beer
very
spicy
if
youre
into
that
edit
i
tweaked
my
scoring
taste
from
a
3
0
to
4
0
to
reflect
a
different
bottle
that
i
gave
more
time
to
settle
and
warm
up
obviously
this
is
a
beer
to
spend
some
time
with
and
i
clearly
did
not
give
it
enough
the
first
time
alcohol
becomes
less
astringent
and
more
a
compliment
of
the
flavor
profile
quite
tasty
smooth
well
rounded
spices
but
still
quite
a
lot
of
them
on
the
side
of
a
sipper
but
a
pretty
good
offering
on
the
style
i
just
remember
it
being
much
better
d
for
the
most
half
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
brews
maybe
just
a
little
too
much
flavour
id
still
have
it
again
though
it
would
be
an
occasional
thing
as
that
alcohol
keeps
it
from
being
at
all
sessionable
carbonation
is
ample
body
is
medium
should
be
fuller
bodied
overall
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
is
a
solid
fall
seasonal
that
is
worth
a
shot
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkins
but
this
is
something
that
i
would
pick
up
again
overall
maybe
the
best
pure
pumkin
beer
i
have
had
with
the
most

cheers
drinkability
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
by
any
stretch
though
not
my
favorite
that
honor
belongs
to
the
st
pumking
the
8
is
nowhere
to
be
found
which
is
nice
and
the
spices
are
spoton
in
my
opinion
not
too
prominent
not
too
weak
and
balanced
well
the
pumpkin
tastearoma
isnt
fantastic
though
and
the
mouthfeels
a
little
flat
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
yet
which
isnt
that
many
but
is
over
a
half
dozen
a
very
unique
pumpkin
great
job
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
pours
orange
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
weyerbacher
definitely
got
the
nose
right
this
smells
like
pumpkin
the
flavor
is
also
right
on
the
nose
pumpkin
with
alcohol
lurking
in
the
background
not
my
favorite
style
but
well
done
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
to
get
a
higher
drinkability
rating
picked
up
a
4pk
not
too
long
ago
pours
a
deep
reddishorange
color
the
head
doesnt
last
very
long
long
but
lingers
a
bit
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
sprinkled
with
cinnamon
followed
by
a
sticky
sweet
malty
aroma
taste
is
not
really
like
a
pumpkin
pie
more
of
the
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
spices
good
carbonation
a
very
good
beer
from
weyerbacher
this
one
is
up
there
along
side
dfh
punkin
ale
will
drink
plenty
of
these
this
fall
pours
a
deep
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
shortlived
creamcolored
head
which
recedes
to
a
tiny
ring
with
only
a
trace
of
lacing
it
actually
smells
a
good
bit
like
pumpkin
pie
with
a
big
dose
of
spices
thrown
in
mainly
cinnamon
with
sweet
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
is
not
quite
as
reminiscent
of
pumpkin
pie
to
me
with
a
hit
of
sugar
and
cinnamon
up
front
before
giving
way
to
the
malt
background
and
pumpkin
before
finishing
with
a
spicy
kick
that
lingered
for
a
while
the
mouthfeel
is
good
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
bit
dry
ive
only
had
a
couple
other
pumpkin
ales
but
this
one
is
the
best
very
drinkable
and
another
good
offering
from
weyerbacher
d
it
might
just
be
that
i
could
never
drink
a
lot
of
a
pumpkin
ale
i
dont
know
i
think
thats
what
im
starting
to
find
out
but
the
flavors
are
not
something
i
want
a
ton
of
but
are
nice
to
try
at
least
taste
is
more
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
than
of
pumpkin
but
it
is
there
though
has
a
nice
sweet
pumpkin
light
aftertaste
not
overwhelming
at
all
this
is
a
great
fall
beer
too
bad
its
not
more
of
a
sessionable
beer
this
poured
a
clear
ruby
color
with
a
little
tan
head
it
smelled
like
bitter
pumpkin
and
rusty
copper
hops
with
red
barley
malt
sour
apple
and
a
bit
of
sweet
yeast
it
tasted
like
pumpkin
and
red
malt
mixed
with
sour
apple
and
sour
cherry
hops
and
earthy
copper
hops
as
it
warmed
the
pumpkin
flavor
became
sweeter
and
more
dominant
which
mellowed
out
the
overall
flavor
overall
this
was
a
clean
and
complex
beer
that
had
a
strange
mix
of
sweet
sour
and
bitter
perfectly
haunting
for
halloween
but
not
quite
my
taste
pours
a
dark
orange
with
a
finger
oh
head
that
faded
faily
quickly
smell
is
strong
spicy
pumpkin
pie
as
advertised
taste
is
a
little
sweet
kind
of
brown
sugary
with
a
strong
palate
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
rich
crazy
drinkable
for
an
8abv
beer
one
of
my
annual
autumn
favorites
d
very
drinkable
beer
as
all
of
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
the
aftertaste
balanced
as
well
with
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
to
boot
for
a
nice
warming
fall
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
orange
color
with
a
strong
head
that
starts
up
and
goes
away
really
quickly
good
amount
of
lacing
for
a
pumpkin
ale
a
lot
of
spice
clove
and
a
hint
of
pumpkin
in
the
nose
taste
is
outstanding
nice
balance
of
pumpkin
spice
clove
and
did
i
mention
spice
it
started
off
as
slightly
metallic
but
as
the
beer
went
on
the
pumpkin
and
spice
become
more
pronounced
this
brew
has
much
more
carbonation
that
most
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
in
the
past
it
is
definitely
a
nice
change
of
pace
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
pumpkin
ale
and
im
absolutely
psyched
that
this
is
now
available
in
atlanta
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
nice
treat
despite
all
the
spice
and
the
pumpkiny
goodness
or
perhaps
because
of
the
novelty
of
this
beer
on
my
palate
or
maybe
its
just
because
i
love
me
some
punkin
pie
but
i
found
this
mediumbodied
jewel
especially
tasty
and
very
drinkable
d
well
first
off
this
is
my
first
pumpkin
ale
i
enjoy
it
and
the
spiciness
to
it
would
pair
well
with
many
types
of
dishes
and
even
desserts
furthermore
this
beer
has
kept
well
and
i
would
like
to
have
a
bottle
age
away
for
a
while
to
see
what
happens
could
session
this
stuff
once
you
get
used
to
it
its
actually
a
very
good
style
of
beer
weyerbacher
really
doesnt
make
bad
beer
either
coppery
orangish
with
a
slightly
pinkish
head
nose
is
pumpkin
of
course
and
spice
of
course
wierd
bitterness
that
went
away
as
it
warmed
up
so
i
dont
reccommend
this
one
too
cold
i
think
some
extra
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
would
have
smoothed
this
one
out
but
it
still
is
a
fantastic
pumpkin
beer
great
brewery
great
beer
d
if
you
like
pumpkin
its
a
good
beer
thats
pretty
easy
to
drink
thanks
hyland
for
thinking
of
me
the
body
is
more
moderate
than
full
but
hard
to
tell
with
the
stronger
solvent
notes
coming
out
strong
limited
carbonation
but
ok
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
missing
the
pumpkin
element
with
more
spice
and
alcohol
coming
out
more
not
the
king
here
drank
this
one
with
the
mox
and
the
monkey
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tulip
pint
glass
poured
cloudy
brownish
orange
similar
to
a
snapple
iced
tea
had
a
nice
white
head
about
a
12
inch
but
it
didnt
last
too
long
light
circles
of
lacing
the
smell
was
great
spices
mostly
clove
and
cinnamon
on
top
of
pumpkin
not
so
much
pumpkin
but
pumpkin
pie
tastes
like
thanksgiving
wanted
to
unbutton
my
pants
and
relax
on
the
couch
after
the
first
sip
nice
pumpkin
pie
flavor
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
nice
oily
feel
cant
believe
this
ones
an
imperial
no
alcohol
taste
whatsoever
definitely
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
drinkability
im
not
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
and
this
one
didnt
change
my
mind
about
them
yeah
its
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
so
far
but
thats
not
saying
much
i
guess
its
worth
a
shot
just
once
and
only
once
d
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
two
in
a
night
its
easy
enough
to
drink
but
the
flavors
are
rather
strong
i
think
its
best
suited
for
a
colder
night
outside
overall
a
decent
beer
this
brew
will
give
pumpkin
ales
a
good
name
it
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
nice
halfinch
pillow
head
smell
is
a
good
combination
of
cinnamon
and
spice
with
a
nice
malt
undertone
taste
doh
pumpkin
pie
with
a
malt
backbone
finish
has
a
decent
hop
characteristic
drinkability
is
good
balancing
between
a
light
sweetness
followed
by
a
pleasant
tartness
mouthfeel
is
slightly
chewy
with
a
disntict
dry
quality
at
the
finish
d
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
unique
brew
i
would
definitely
have
another
notes
i
had
this
with
a
slice
of
carrot
cake
which
was
a
nice
pairing
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
brewed
with
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
cardamom
and
clove
damn
bottle
volcanoed
on
me
messing
up
the
decant
hence
my
glass
is
full
of
particulates
the
beer
is
reddishauburn
and
very
carbonated
for
the
first
two
minutes
building
up
a
fizzy
inch
of
head
but
soon
after
it
is
nearly
lifeless
with
a
tiny
collar
that
doesnt
lace
the
glass
cardamom
and
cinnamon
are
the
first
aromas
to
hit
followed
by
the
other
two
spices
a
dose
of
cola
and
light
hops
and
malt
flavorwise
pumpkin
and
cardamom
start
the
show
then
its
cinnamon
and
light
malts
theres
also
some
mild
hop
bitterness
but
no
real
hop
flavor
all
on
top
of
a
lightmedium
body
that
is
very
dry
and
carbonated
on
the
tongue
a
decent
pumpkin
with
nice
spices
but
it
needs
more
actual
pumpkin
flavor
in
addition
the
yeast
is
too
clean
and
attenuative
thinning
the
body
more
than
id
like
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
try
this
one
out
but
if
not
you
can
pass
rich
amber
to
maroon
color
keeps
a
huge
frothy
lasting
beige
head
gorgeous
beer
big
meaty
pumpkin
pie
aroma
especially
after
1st
opening
and
just
a
faint
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
is
nice
typical
spices
associated
with
the
style
but
not
as
robustly
flavored
and
intense
as
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
great
and
nicely
thick
which
most
pumpkins
seem
to
lack
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
only
peeks
out
minimally
great
pumpkin
beer
all
around
but
i
actually
prefered
the
flavor
of
schlaflys
pumpkin
while
maybe
not
the
mouthfeel
of
it
d
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
d
a
great
fall
drink
on
a
chilly
october
taste
is
very
spicy
as
indicated
from
the
smell
good
malt
backbone
with
a
slight
hop
balance
good
carbonation
level
one
of
the
more
intensely
spiced
pumpkin
beers
out
there
yet
somehow
remains
fairly
balanced
and
not
overwhelming
overall
i
am
not
a
fan
of
fruitvegetable
beers
so
this
one
is
a
little
biased
it
is
worth
a
try
but
i
wont
be
getting
more
as
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
i
tried
a
huge
variety
this
past
autumn
and
i
must
say
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
that
ive
sampled
from
a
22
oz
bomber
copped
from
bottle
king
in
glen
ridge
this
mother
of
pumpkin
ales
pours
a
beautiful
copperorangebronze
color
with
modest
frothy
head
smell
is
full
of
pumpkinpie
flavors
bursting
through
with
cinnamon
some
ginger
and
other
noticeable
spices
cloves
are
also
present
and
the
intense
aroma
leads
to
an
equally
bold
taste
which
strongly
complemented
the
smell
great
authentic
pumpkin
taste
which
really
poured
through
this
one
as
far
as
the
8
abv
is
concerned
you
dont
really
taste
it
in
this
one
i
really
liked
this
brew
very
interesting
and
full
of
flavor
and
characteristic
wonderful
sample
from
weyerbacher
which
is
a
brewery
known
for
the
bold
and
eccentric
brews
for
all
the
pumpkin
ale
fans
out
there
this
is
definitely
a
musttry
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
two
tulip
glasses
a
thin
head
formed
that
faded
a
bit
quickly
there
was
a
real
lack
of
carbonation
the
color
was
a
brownish
orange
and
the
smell
was
of
cinnamon
and
spices
there
was
a
definite
taste
of
pumpkin
on
the
palate
but
it
didnt
do
much
for
me
the
body
was
a
bit
weak
and
the
flavor
didnt
grab
my
taste
buds
it
got
a
bit
bland
as
it
warmed
to
room
temperature
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
imperial
pumpkins
that
i
have
ever
tried
not
sure
id
buy
this
one
again
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
kind
of
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
it
isnt
quite
the
best
pumpkin
ale
that
ive
had
but
its
not
bad
the
fact
that
it
will
fill
you
up
would
make
it
difficult
to
put
away
more
than
one
bomber
especially
since
pumpkin
ales
are
pretty
difficult
to
drink
more
than
one
of
to
begin
with
pours
a
slightly
fogged
amber
with
minimal
crème
head
nose
is
very
smoked
spices
almost
seems
like
a
rauch
to
me
flavor
is
definitely
influenced
by
the
alcohol
but
not
hijacked
by
it
spices
mix
well
and
dont
overdo
it
pumpkin
is
mildly
there
feel
has
a
biting
carbonation
to
it
drinkable
yes
in
comparison
to
much
of
the
pumpkin
garbage
out
there
this
is
definitely
a
step
above
however
it
doesnt
carry
the
right
tone
of
pumpkin
character
that
it
should
i
feel
bottom
line
pumpking
is
just
that
definitely
a
fallwinter
seasonal
worth
exploring
d
i
couldnt
take
the
taste
however
both
parents
including
a
mom
who
barely
drinks
thinks
im
nuts
for
bringing
all
these
weird
beers
back
when
i
visit
had
no
trouble
finishing
it
as
much
as
i
hate
to
let
someone
elses
opinion
shape
my
own
its
clear
from
the
way
they
devoured
it
it
you
enjoy
the
spices
the
drinkability
is
good
big
strong
aroma
to
start
full
of
pumpkin
meat
and
crust
garnished
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
is
good
but
comes
off
too
spiceheavy
taking
away
from
the
nice
malts
and
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
overall
it
feels
like
a
bigger
beer
but
still
hides
the
8
well
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
and
tastier
than
the
other
imperial
ive
tried
pumking
d
the
spiciness
cuts
down
on
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
this
is
a
great
beer
second
to
pumpking
in
the
style
definitely
check
it
out
this
beer
is
a
nice
orange
with
a
fair
head
and
a
ton
of
floaters
the
smell
is
of
a
spiced
pumkin
pie
the
taste
is
like
a
pumkin
with
spices
there
is
also
a
herbal
sharpness
to
the
taste
that
is
a
little
much
the
abv
shows
a
little
too
and
this
all
affects
the
drinkability
overall
a
fair
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
go
out
oy
my
way
to
try
again
i
had
a
bit
of
a
tough
time
getting
through
the
whole
bomber
because
of
all
the
spice
which
affected
the
drinkability
a
bit
for
me
ive
had
a
lot
of
pumpkin
ale
this
season
and
i
think
ive
come
to
the
determination
that
i
just
dont
like
them
all
that
much
this
is
the
second
best
one
ive
had
behind
only
the
southern
tier
pumking
which
blows
this
and
every
other
one
away
i
will
probably
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
again
next
fall
but
only
one
d
i
enjoyed
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
but
i
dont
find
it
so
imperially
strong
a
neat
beer
not
one
id
fall
in
love
with
though
pours
a
cloudy
orangebrown
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
halloween
thick
egg
shell
head
tons
of
lace
good
retention
forms
a
solid
layer
nice
looking
beer
smell
is
caramel
ginger
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
bread
smells
like
liquid
cookies
some
honey
very
neat
taste
is
licorice
root
bread
cookies
ginger
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
plus
other
spice
caramel
and
alcohol
pretty
neat
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
lightly
syrupy
but
with
high
carbonation
kind
of
confused
by
the
mouthfeel
but
i
liked
it
damned
solid
pumpkin
beer
thanks
chris
and
kyoko
drinkability
above
average
pumpkin
ale
very
tasty
just
not
as
pumpkin
flavored
as
i
would
have
liked
the
8
abv
does
not
made
itself
known
and
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drink
this
is
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
but
is
definitely
in
the
top
few
d
for
a
pumpkin
ale
this
is
superb
perhaps
a
making
it
a
bit
thinner
and
cranking
up
the
carbonation
a
little
would
make
this
more
drinkable
for
me
but
i
think
it
sets
itself
apart
from
other
pumpkins
remarkably
well
the
abv
is
fairly
well
hidden
which
is
something
weyerbacher
seems
to
do
very
well
now
this
is
what
iu
am
talking
about
i
had
waited
forever
as
i
missed
out
on
this
one
last
year
but
this
year
i
was
not
going
to
be
denied
picked
one
up
in
asheville
on
my
last
trip
through
town
and
picked
last
night
to
give
it
a
try
poured
a
nice
medium
hazy
amber
with
a
definite
reddish
tint
to
it
lots
of
visible
carbonation
was
apparent
as
was
a
nice
three
finger
head
of
foamy
white
lace
which
receded
very
slowly
and
left
concentric
rings
of
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
enchanting
full
of
pumpkin
spice
and
cinnamon
it
was
very
full
with
no
sense
of
the
alcohol
the
flavor
was
great
a
very
full
balanced
attack
of
spice
with
a
decidedly
malty
grain
back
bone
that
was
just
strong
enough
to
peak
its
head
through
and
let
you
know
it
was
there
great
smooth
finish
left
you
thirsting
for
another
sip
the
feel
was
a
nice
creamy
medium
body
that
had
ample
carbonation
overall
this
was
wonderful
and
was
every
bit
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
a
full
frontal
assault
of
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
galore
e
with
a
great
balanced
feel
and
a
well
hidden
alcohol
this
was
defiantly
a
good
one
and
something
i
will
look
forward
to
picking
up
next
year
for
sure
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
it
was
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
1
finger
thick
off
white
foamy
head
the
head
left
a
ring
that
lasted
the
whole
time
aroma
was
definitely
reminiscent
of
a
good
fresh
pumpkin
pie
picked
up
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
cloves
along
with
some
lemon
zesty
hints
tasted
like
orangey
pumpkin
pie
the
spices
were
much
more
pronounced
in
the
aroma
than
in
the
taste
which
was
disappointing
felt
good
in
the
mouth
consistency
was
good
just
solid
enough
to
coat
the
mouth
a
bit
of
carbonation
detracted
from
the
mouth
feel
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
ended
up
drinking
the
whole
glass
without
knowing
it
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
this
is
a
very
tasty
pumpkin
ale
lots
of
spices
but
they
are
not
offensive
the
malt
balance
all
the
spices
very
well
this
beer
is
amber
in
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
always
suggests
a
big
beer
to
me
the
smell
is
as
others
have
described
pure
pumpkin
pie
with
a
strong
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
aroma
the
taste
is
floral
and
perfumey
with
a
little
mustiness
at
the
end
and
does
not
quite
taste
like
pumpkin
this
is
good
but
i
cant
imagine
ever
wanting
more
than
one
in
fact
it
would
be
best
at
six
ounces
so
maybe
split
one
with
a
friend
the
spiciness
is
just
very
pronounced
although
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
moderate
in
texture
the
moderate
carbonation
doesnt
do
much
to
lighten
up
the
starchiness
a
bit
dry
and
yeasty
in
the
finish
very
flavorful
and
complex
for
a
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
some
great
ones
southern
tier
imperial
pumking
and
some
really
poor
ones
and
id
say
this
is
certainly
on
the
better
half
to
be
honest
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
beer
but
this
wasnt
bad
deep
amber
color
with
a
thin
but
sufficient
head
nose
of
big
red
gum
cinnamon
flavor
was
rich
in
banana
bread
maltiness
with
nutmeg
cloves
and
cardamon
following
up
the
body
was
rich
and
actually
was
the
first
pumpkin
beer
to
really
remind
me
of
pumpkin
pie
not
just
the
spices
but
the
texture
8
alcohol
is
well
masked
this
should
be
a
christmas
beer
as
well
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
tried
yet
i
could
almost
taste
the
whipped
cream
and
pie
crust
overall
this
was
one
of
the
more
intense
and
impressive
pumpkin
ales
that
i
have
sampled
d
im
not
sure
what
it
is
about
these
pumpkin
beers
including
an
imperial
one
no
less
but
i
feel
this
one
can
only
go
so
far
pumpkin
ales
seem
to
require
a
balancing
act
thats
quite
difficult
to
perfect
granted
the
balance
of
spice
is
tasty
and
i
can
always
appreciate
a
seasonal
offering
that
requires
extra
effort
but
im
not
completely
sold
on
this
one
drinkability
a
very
nice
seaonal
offering
from
weyerbacher
i
plan
on
drinking
some
more
of
this
around
thanksgiving
buy
it
by
the
case
love
it
while
you
can
awesome
a
beer
the
beer
presents
a
dark
amber
color
with
little
head
retention
upon
smelling
the
beer
one
is
hit
with
a
sweet
aroma
with
the
ever
present
pumpking
pie
spices
mixed
in
the
taste
is
malty
but
definately
sweet
perhaps
belgain
candi
sugar
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
are
lightly
present
and
therefore
not
too
overpowering
as
you
sometimes
get
with
pumpkin
ales
lastly
the
beer
has
a
dry
afterfinish
from
the
phenols
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
i
gave
my
roommate
a
sip
and
he
couldnt
believe
how
tasty
it
was
maybe
a
full
flavored
cow
cheese
isnt
the
recommended
choice
of
deliciousness
that
goes
with
a
pumpkin
beer
but
imho
it
goes
great
thanks
again
to
beertruth
for
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
this
fall
taste
treat
tons
of
pumpkin
clove
and
cinnamon
in
the
aroma
big
pumpkin
clove
in
the
taste
smooth
and
creamy
body
sharp
bite
of
cinnamon
and
hops
in
the
finish
no
alcohol
to
be
found
in
this
very
tasty
treat
this
was
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
it
had
a
nice
orange
amber
color
to
it
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
was
a
mixture
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
clove
and
allspice
the
flavour
had
a
nice
spiciness
to
it
with
a
heft
of
malt
it
went
down
so
well
i
had
two
id
recommend
this
one
and
id
open
another
bomber
of
it
if
i
had
one
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
very
lively
light
tan
colored
head
that
dissipated
quickly
but
tickled
the
lips
as
i
took
my
first
sip
smell
was
by
no
means
overpowering
very
subtle
scent
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
beautiful
dark
amberorange
color
with
ample
carbonation
however
very
little
lacing
clung
to
the
glass
during
the
sample
taste
was
very
mild
compared
to
other
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tried
in
the
past
again
taste
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
perhaps
some
clove
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
with
very
little
astringence
considering
the
8
0
abv
a
very
pleasant
seasonal
brew
i
was
hesitant
at
first
to
purchase
due
to
past
experience
but
was
happy
i
did
drinkability
was
only
a
3
5
because
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
but
definitely
worth
a
pour
drinkabilitynotes
what
a
really
nice
pumpkin
ale
maybe
the
best
ive
had
this
year
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
pumpkins
but
have
grown
to
like
them
and
this
one
hits
the
spot
plenty
of
pumpkin
flavor
with
loads
of
pie
spices
in
the
nose
and
in
the
flavor
hops
to
play
a
role
as
the
balance
the
beer
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
alcohol
is
really
well
hidden
especially
for
8
thus
making
it
easy
to
drink
but
it
will
sneak
up
on
you
a
really
fine
pumpkin
ale
from
the
folks
at
weyerbacher
seek
and
enjoy
definitely
recommended
d
this
beer
was
pretty
drinkable
it
tasted
very
good
and
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
smooth
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
the
large
amount
of
spices
evident
started
to
get
to
my
stomach
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
overall
a
good
beer
drinkability
is
noteworthy
with
this
beer
a
better
than
average
pumpkin
ale
with
a
strength
that
quite
deceiving
decent
drinkability
easing
up
on
the
spices
would
have
done
this
beer
some
good
going
a
more
barleywine
route
might
have
been
good
i
liked
this
for
its
boldness
and
character
but
theres
not
a
ton
of
depth
and
i
dont
think
id
want
to
drink
much
of
it
in
any
season
so
the
drinkability
isnt
what
it
could
be
but
i
nevertheless
give
props
to
weyerbacher
for
conjuring
up
this
mean
pumpkin
see
label
overall
there
wasnt
as
much
pumpkin
as
i
thought
there
would
be
more
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
cloves
than
anything
and
maybe
the
cardamon
but
im
not
sure
what
that
tastes
like
to
begin
with
still
i
found
this
one
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
pumpkin
beers
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
tumbler
at
fifty
degrees
the
beer
wa
gas
colored
with
a
tan
head
head
that
quickly
decayed
away
the
beer
smelled
great
very
spicy
very
fallish
i
did
not
however
taste
any
pumpkin
just
spices
that
were
way
overpowering
not
my
cup
of
beer
it
would
be
great
as
an
air
freshener
i
guesss
i
will
not
buy
again
this
beer
is
decidedly
good
i
am
new
to
this
whole
pumpkin
ale
thing
i
believe
this
is
my
third
type
i
must
say
i
like
them
this
beer
tastes
like
a
pumpkin
pie
smells
never
had
the
pie
but
this
beer
makes
me
think
of
it
regardless
its
full
of
spice
and
punch
without
overpowering
its
a
good
beer
and
great
example
of
the
pumpkin
ale
style
i
wish
the
head
retention
and
aroma
had
been
better
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
makes
up
for
it
d
pretty
darn
good
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
with
most
pumpkin
beers
im
looking
for
something
that
tastes
good
to
have
once
but
i
feel
like
i
could
have
a
bunch
of
these
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
for
being
8abv
the
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
was
expecting
something
overpowering
but
instead
got
something
complex
and
fulfilling
the
lacing
never
really
showed
up
i
guess
i
need
to
clean
my
glasses
a
little
better
for
next
time
although
pumpkin
ales
dont
seem
to
have
the
best
lacing
especially
when
compared
to
dipas
this
one
is
certainly
worth
a
try
maybe
youll
be
surprised
as
well
recommended
a
most
enjoyable
beer
regardless
of
genre
it
seems
like
a
number
of
pumpkin
ales
actually
have
little
to
do
with
pumpkin
and
are
more
about
warmth
spice
vs
sweet
malts
and
mouthfeel
over
taste
im
not
complaining
just
something
ive
noticed
this
was
very
nice
and
would
be
great
with
spicy
fare
especially
cuisine
that
embraces
tradition
holiday
spices
as
everyday
in
their
recipes
as
well
as
with
some
really
sharp
dry
cheddar
or
go
completely
180
degrees
with
some
rich
soft
creamy
bleu
definitely
one
of
the
best
autumn
beers
ive
tried
id
love
to
enjoy
this
outside
to
see
just
how
god
those
warming
qualities
are
definitely
recommended
i
love
pumpkin
ales
there
are
good
and
bad
ones
out
there
but
when
theyre
good
theyre
good
so
i
was
excited
to
find
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
ive
drank
a
couple
bombers
of
this
already
but
havent
taken
the
time
to
review
it
it
pours
a
very
appealing
reddishorange
in
other
words
a
solid
pumpkin
color
very
rich
tall
white
head
with
good
retention
leaves
rings
of
lace
all
around
the
glass
smells
very
strongly
of
warm
almost
roasted
pumpkin
plus
some
rich
pie
spices
such
as
the
cinnamon
nutmeg
cloves
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
too
tastes
are
phenomenal
the
best
ive
ever
had
in
a
pumpkin
ale
this
is
what
ive
been
looking
for
again
with
the
roasted
pumpkin
and
the
spices
little
alcohol
bite
a
nice
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
which
balances
out
the
sweetness
overall
wonderful
flavors
like
seriously
drinking
a
pie
of
liquid
pumpkin
pie
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
not
as
thick
as
a
stout
but
smooth
like
a
maibock
so
smooth
that
i
swear
they
used
oats
in
the
mash
this
is
a
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
probably
the
best
one
ive
ever
come
across
its
flavors
and
aromas
are
rich
and
bold
but
not
overpowering
weyerbacher
has
really
committed
to
the
style
rather
than
just
cramming
spices
in
or
using
a
pumpkin
additive
i
will
definitely
return
to
this
one
again
and
again
its
a
new
reason
to
look
forward
to
fall
md
a
easily
drinkable
beer
with
great
flavor
however
rather
light
on
the
flavor
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
ale
just
dont
know
what
makes
it
imperial
there
is
your
typical
pumpkin
pie
spice
aroma
and
flavor
but
whats
noteworthy
for
me
is
an
almost
licorice
aroma
and
flavor
the
more
i
drink
the
more
this
becomes
noticeable
eventually
this
aroma
and
flavor
hinders
the
drinkability
otherwise
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
typical
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
low
hops
and
high
spicy
malt
alcohol
is
well
masked
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
spicy
tongue
tingle
not
bad
but
i
prefer
others
drinkable
nope
it
is
a
candle
a
smell
to
be
put
in
the
air
in
the
fall
not
a
drink
final
note
i
like
pumpkin
ales
in
the
early
fall
and
i
would
put
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
at
3
right
behind
southampton
pumpkin
ale
and
my
1
favorite
southern
tier
pumking
it
should
be
noted
that
i
tasted
this
alongside
southern
tiers
pumking
and
it
should
also
be
noted
pumking
blew
its
doors
off
gives

perennial
favorite

one
of
the
best
a
must
have
this
autumn
oelergud
very
nice
offering
from
weyerbacher
and
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
if
you
dont
like
pumpkin
ales
you
wont
like
this
one
either
but
if
you
do
this
one
is
particularly
potent
and
spicy
the
addition
of
cardamom
makes
this
one
particularly
luscious
pours
a
reddish
brown
quite
clear
with
a
short
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
great
redolent
of
spices
and
pumpkin
particularly
cardamom
cinammon
and
cloves
the
taste
is
similar
but
a
little
more
subdued
than
the
wonderful
aroma
still
a
nice
spiciness
but
it
falls
off
a
little
and
creamy
and
slightly
sour
pumpkin
takes
over
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
relatively
substantial
delicious
and
enjoyable
fall
treat
wow
imperial
pumpkin
honestly
im
glad
someone
did
it
but
its
not
suited
for
everyone
thats
for
sure
i
remain
firmly
on
the
fence
about
the
whole
thing
as
interesting
as
this
beer
is
its
not
all
that
accessible
you
really
gotta
love
pumpkins
and
spices
to
enjoy
a
whole
bomber
of
this
still
its
a
seasonal
phenomenon
worth
trying
thanks
to
weyerbacher
for
once
again
testing
the
limits
of
brewing
conventionality
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
good
its
nice
and
smooth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
a
pumpkin
beer
i
dont
think
id
have
more
than
this
bomber
but
its
going
down
easy
overall
pretty
solid
effort
di
was
expecting
more
the
clove
taste
is
too
strong
and
i
prefer
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
my
pumpkin
beers
that
said
this
is
still
a
tasty
beverage
but
not
my
favourite
pumpkin
pours
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
traces
of
lace
nice
clear
amber
color
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
strong
pumpkin
nose
flavor
is
similar
to
a
pumpkin
pie
with
a
hop
backing
but
not
really
sweet
like
a
pie
5
00
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
tullys
beer
and
wine
wells
me
pours
a
deep
ruby
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
ring
but
leaves
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
course
dominated
by
pumpkin
spice
the
taste
is
dominated
by
pumpkin
as
well
but
some
burnt
caramel
comes
through
as
well
the
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
with
some
alcohol
coming
through
but
not
too
much
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
style
that
does
not
need
to
go
imperial
pours
a
pure
copper
with
a
huge
white
head
that
takes
its
time
lacing
throughout
smells
like
i
just
stuck
my
nose
in
a
freshly
baked
pumpkin
pie
wow
pumpkin
nutmeg
cinnimon
delicious
smelling
dove
right
into
this
and
it
didnt
dissapoint
all
that
is
in
the
smell
along
with
a
touch
of
clove
and
some
other
spice
feels
medium
in
the
mouth
with
a
tickle
of
carbonation
oh
what
i
would
do
to
have
a
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
right
now
to
compliment
the
beer
abv
is
non
existant
compared
to
the
other
pumpkins
ive
tasted
i
know
why
they
called
this
imperial
a
delicious
treat
that
must
be
tried
if
you
like
the
kind
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
firm
malt
base
along
with
a
wonderful
pumpkin
spice
aroma
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
excellent
along
with
a
bold
amount
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
this
is
an
amber
beer
so
crystal
malts
were
used
to
soften
the
pumpkin
taste
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
pumpkin
spice
flavor
that
is
easy
drinking
even
at
8
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
by
the
spices
and
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
less
than
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
pumpkin
beer
maybe
the
best
around
but
i
need
more
co2
there
is
zero
head
retention
and
the
mouthfeel
suffers
without
it
drinkability
very
nice
brew
for
my
first
pumpkin
this
was
extremely
impressive
from
weyerbacher
this
could
easily
pass
for
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
yet
the
pumpkin
malt
gives
it
a
lighter
weight
and
made
it
much
more
drinkable
loving
another
winner
from
weyerbacher
the
flavor
is
a
bit
disappointing
there
are
hints
of
the
items
i
described
above
but
theyre
just
not
deep
enough
and
the
aftertaste
is
rather
bitter
and
shortlasting
on
the
upside
the
creamy
mouthfeel
and
warming
alcohol
is
out
of
this
world
and
the
bit
of
brown
sugar
i
detected
at
the
finish
was
delightful
22oz
bomber
from
rsvp
copperred
translucent
body
with
a
good
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
smells
like
cinnamon
nutmeg
nut
banana
and
pumpkin
nutmeg
plays
a
big
roll
in
the
flavor
as
well
with
pumpkin
and
fruit
also
at
the
forefront
and
hints
of
cinnamon
as
well
no
alcohol
flavor
detectable
thought
a
bit
of
alcohol
warming
is
present
fairly
full
in
mouthfeel
with
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
keeping
the
finish
somewhat
clean
with
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
spice
present
afterward
one
sip
definitely
invites
another
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
ale
and
something
i
can
see
having
as
a
comfort
beer
year
after
year
in
the
fall
came
out
an
excellent
copper
color
very
reminiscent
of
a
overdone
pumpkin
pie
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
too
very
pumpkin
with
an
excellent
addition
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
has
a
decent
head
although
almost
no
lacing
goes
down
easily
although
not
the
smoothest
brew
ive
ever
had
nice
pumpkin
flavor
with
aftertastes
of
the
spices
if
you
want
a
nice
harvestautumn
beer
that
will
keep
you
warm
8
abv
this
is
an
excellent
choice
very
good
beer
much
of
the
same
as
the
2008
batch
very
subtle
pumpkin
flavor
with
spice
dominating
and
the
abv
lurking
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
aromas
consisting
of
spices
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
a
nice
presence
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
alcohol
and
nutmeg
cinnamon
with
hints
of
pumpkin
a
smooth
spicy
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
pumpkin
aftertaste
yet
small
nice
spices
and
not
too
overbarring
pours
a
dark
brown
red
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
of
cinnamon
and
somewhat
of
a
nutty
bread
too
after
drinking
a
bit
i
noticed
a
similarity
with
the
smell
of
goldschlager
taste
is
also
heavy
on
the
cinnamon
a
little
nutty
and
some
pumpkin
too
this
one
has
a
full
mouthfeeling
and
warms
the
chest
with
alcohol
is
this
a
beer
to
try
definitely
a
great
offering
from
weyerbacher
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
though
there
is
good
carbonation
i
will
finish
this
bomber
but
this
will
be
my
last
one
for
this
year
hopefully
next
year
will
be
better
as
for
this
year
there
are
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
d
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
pumpkin
ale
i
dont
have
much
of
a
comparison
to
other
pumpkin
ales
because
i
have
only
sampled
one
otherand
didnt
get
enough
of
a
feel
for
it
to
review
it
that
being
said
i
do
like
this
beer
pumpkin
ale
along
with
winter
warmer
seems
to
be
a
fun
style
of
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
this
is
yet
another
job
well
done
by
weyerbacherone
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
this
and
other
pumpkin
ales
around
halloween
time
during
the
cool
crisp
days
of
fall
oh
and
abvundetectable
in
the
taste
and
barely
present
in
the
mouthfeel
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
not
that
im
overly
familiar
with
the
style
mind
you
the
fresh
pumpkin
flavor
is
definitely
interesting
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
its
a
great
fall
beer
recommended
score
reflects
an
average
of
two
reviews
a
tangypeppery
mouthfeel
a
good
pumpkin
beernot
a
harsh
as
i
would
have
thought
being
imperial
could
drink
and
few
of
thesebut
not
all
night
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
sa
pint
glass
nice
looking
beer
dark
amber
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
was
all
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
maybe
a
little
clove
i
think
the
spice
dominated
the
taste
and
really
couldnt
tell
there
was
pumpkin
in
it
it
felt
warm
in
my
mouth
and
for
this
style
of
beer
was
pretty
good
i
dont
know
what
the
imperial
is
on
this
beer
except
for
the
increased
alcohol
which
is
hardly
noticable
i
lowered
the
drinkability
score
to
reflect
my
lack
of
interest
in
the
flavor
there
are
no
flaws
but
i
found
nothing
special
about
this
pumpkin
highly
recommended
i
wont
rush
back
to
this
but
neither
will
i
shun
it
burnt
copper
color
with
an
admirable
head
noticeable
spicy
aromacloves
and
cinnamon
dominate
spices
dominate
the
flavor
malty
but
there
is
an
underlying
alcohol
flavor
that
mars
the
overall
taste
ok
bodynot
overly
imperial
rather
dissappointing
as
a
homebrewer
i
know
a
little
spice
goes
a
long
way
this
is
rather
unbalanced
and
too
spicy
for
my
tastes
too
much
booze
flavor
in
there
to
boot
nice
to
try
but
not
again
for
me
the
last
time
i
reviewed
this
brew
i
mentioned
the
artwork
on
the
label
wyerbacher
has
upgraded
the
artwork
check
it
out
the
new
label
is
even
better
like
any
good
pumpkin
pie
i
really
want
to
have
another
im
not
sure
if
id
be
feeling
so
great
after
several
of
these
but
i
still
want
several
while
at
first
i
was
skeptical
of
another
style
of
beer
being
labeled
as
imperial
i
figured
id
give
this
one
a
try
in
anticipation
of
the
upcoming
fall
season
the
beer
poured
a
clear
medium
amber
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
aroma
reminded
me
of
freshly
baked
pumpkin
pie
lots
of
spices
and
pumpkin
along
with
sweet
malts
taste
was
equally
as
nice
like
liquid
pumpkin
pie
except
with
a
kick
mouthfeel
was
quite
light
making
this
one
way
too
easy
to
drink
the
22
oz
bomber
disappeared
rather
quickly
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
this
beer
is
a
strong
as
the
label
states
if
you
like
flavoredspiced
beers
this
ones
definitely
recommended
i
will
admit
that
i
am
not
such
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
flavored
beers
but
i
had
always
been
a
little
curious
about
this
beer
so
i
decided
it
was
worth
a
try
it
poured
a
copperruby
color
with
a
healthy
white
head
the
spices
are
what
hits
the
nose
first
with
aroma
lots
of
clove
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
perhaps
some
pepper
the
pumpkin
really
comes
through
in
the
taste
along
with
the
spices
mentioned
above
it
is
very
similar
to
a
piece
of
rich
pumpkin
pie
one
thing
i
will
definitely
say
is
that
the
heightened
alcohol
does
lend
itself
to
the
quality
of
this
beer
it
is
not
in
your
face
but
is
there
enough
to
compliment
the
other
tastes
that
are
present
i
would
sip
this
brew
all
night
long
this
is
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
maybe
it
will
inspire
me
to
sample
others
also
it
is
beers
like
this
that
make
me
look
forward
to
the
cooler
weather
of
fall
im
impressed
with
this
beer
since
it
doesnt
try
to
be
a
big
beer
just
for
the
heck
of
it
it
seems
like
theres
a
purpose
for
everything
here
which
makes
it
much
more
interesting
if
you
enjoy
the
pumpkin
style
and
want
a
little
extra
kick
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
you
d
very
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
as
a
fall
beer
alternative
to
the
regular
oktoberfests
and
other
red
ales
d
a
tasty
brew
but
might
be
a
bit
cloying
with
the
sweetness
and
spice
if
multiples
are
attempted
very
tasty
spiced
pumpkin
flavor
great
choice
of
seasonal
d
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
and
its
jumped
to
the
top

recommended

you
can
only
really
drink
one
pumpkin
beer
at
a
time
but
this
one
isnt
a
bad
one
poured
from
a
22oz
brown
bomber
bottle
into
my
dogfish
head
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
smells
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
and
caramel
malt
tastes
as
good
as
it
smells
the
sweet
baking
spices
in
the
nose
are
also
very
dominant
in
the
taste
i
know
its
been
said
to
death
but
this
is
liquid
pumpkin
pie
period
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
rich
and
satisfying
im
content
after
just
one
bomber
if
you
like
pumpkin
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
thanks
for
the
extra
bottle
mymrnngjckt
the
pour
into
my
trois
pistoles
glass
raises
a
a
thin
layer
of
light
tan
foam
that
quickly
bubbles
away
the
slight
lace
manages
to
stick
a
bit
the
body
is
a
hazy
rubycopper
the
nose
has
a
lot
of
the
usual
pumpkin
pie
spices
floating
around
and
theyre
definitely
leading
the
pumpkin
aroma
the
taste
is
highly
spiced
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
being
primary
again
the
pumpkin
is
mild
the
mouth
is
too
carbonated
ive
really
had
much
better
pumpkin
beers
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
an
orangeredcopper
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
ok
it
smells
very
spicy
like
cinnamon
cloves
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
way
it
smells
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
too
much
but
still
going
down
smooth
drinkability
is
good
too
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
pumpkin
ale
id
definitely
buy
it
again
md
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
is
entirely
hidden
i
look
forward
to
next
year
tried
weyerbachers
imperial
pumpkin
ale
for
the
first
time
during
the
fall
of
2006
for
my
2006
round
of
pumpkin
ale
tasting
shipyard
saranac
and
weyerbacher
while
shipyards
pumpkinhead
ale
was
the
best
of
the
fall
2005
round
when
compared
against
post
roads
blue
moons
and
smuttynoses
offerings
this
years
lot
of
shipyards
pumpkinhead
fell
a
bit
short
saranacs
pumpkin
ale
and
weyerbachers
imperial
pumpkin
ale
were
similar
in
style
versus
shipyards
which
is
lighter
wheat
ale
but
the
weyerbachers
was
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
tasted
drinkability
over
and
over
and
over
not
too
heavy
and
doesnt
trapse
into
novelty
territory
like
some
other
seasonal
beers
ill
start
off
by
saying
that
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
that
i
have
ever
had
there
is
enough
real
pumpkin
fruit
flavor
and
aroma
to
make
me
buyin
to
the
style
a
pronounces
spiciness
cinnamon
nutmeg
to
stimulate
the
nose
and
offers
a
snap
and
a
bite
to
the
flavor
and
feel
what
makes
this
beer
is
a
very
solid
beer
base
malty
enough
to
substantiate
the
dominant
pumkin
spice
flavors
and
aromas
the
beer
remains
full
and
rich
throughout
without
watering
or
allowing
the
spices
to
bite
finsihes
with
a
clean
and
challenging
spiciness
with
a
hint
of
spruce
hops
very
pleasant
and
easytodrink
beer
without
sacrificing
body
or
character
just
got
this
in
the
mail
today
much
thanks

im
willing
to
cellar
a
few
bottles
to
see
what
they
do
this
beer
is
pretty
hard
to
get
so
get
it
while
you
can
appears
cloudy
rusty
orange
in

nice
offwhite

receeds
to

clove
with
some
nutmeg

hinted
in
there
taste
is
all
spices
mainly
the
clove
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
also
present
but
in
less
of
a
direct
way
just
a
touch
hint
of
pumpkin
medium
in
body
with
some
good
carbonation
not
too
overpowering
very
easy
to
drink
with
its
alcohol
being
masked
nicely
overall
has
a
great
flavor
but
really
cannot
be
sessioned
thick
body
and
heavy
carbonation
i
dont
need
another
disappointing
offering
from
a
brewery
ive
developed
an
appreciation
for
first
sip
reveals
an
avearge
body
with
silky
texture
and
very
fine
tingly
carbonation
there
is
a
slight
stickiness
on
my
lips
after
each
sip
flavor
is
sweet
malt
and
spices
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
dominant
but
a
bit
of
doughy
yeast
as
well
easy
drinker
with
no
hint
of
abv
worth
a
try
in
the
fall
maybe
a
good
pairing
for
thanksgiving
dinner
very
nice
beer
went
well
with

the
drinkability
is
good

one

is
good

brings
a
solid
blast
of
allspice
and
nutmeg
with
a
little
fleashy
pumpkin
giving
me
a
solid
sense
of
pumpkin
pie
it
seems
to
hit
all
the
highlites
for
a
pumpkin
beer
the
flavor
strong
in
the
spicing
with
nutmeg
which
is
followed
by
an
alcohol
solventyness
i
feel
that
the
alcohol
covers
up
the
fleshy
pumpkin
flavor
that
i
get
hints
of
but
find
hidden
its
okay
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
a
light
carbonation
it
really
feels
full
i
feel
that
this
one
suffers
from
the
high
alcohol
in
both
the
flavor
and
the
drinkability
it
just
brings
our
characters
in
the
beer
that
i
think
are
not
the
highlites
of
the
brew
d
i
like
the
imperial
take
on
the
pumpkin
style
the
8
abv
is
well
hidden
this
one
tastes
like
an
imperial
version
of
great
lakes
christmas
in
my
opinion
very
similar
but
much
bigger
the
clove
is
a
little
overpowering
in
the
taste
but
a
very
nice
seasonal
d
i
was
disappointed
but
it
was
still
a
good
beer
nonetheless
i
saved
it
for
a
few
months
and
after
one
whiff
was
expecting
more
from
it
id
still
definitely
suggest
picking
one
up
if
you
have
the
chance
pours
clear
and
copper
with
a
good
size
tancream
head
that
slowly
recedes
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
pumpkin
pie
cinnamon
and
spices
on
top
of
an
underlying
soft
sweetness
a
nice
bready
and
malty
sweetness
hits
the
tongue
followed
by
a
yeastiness
and
finished
with
a
mildly
dry
hoppiness
mixed
with
cinnamon
and
spice
there
is
a
nice
tingly
pepperiness
that
comes
in
mid
taste
and
mixes
with
the
dry
finish
and
a
small
alcohol
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
pretty
tasty
although
one
is
enough
for
me
with
the
pumpkin
pie
spice
flavors
cant
help
but
enjoy
the
8
abv
imperial
factor
as
well
all
in
all
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
but
there
are
a
few
others
i
would
drink
first
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
the
abv
strenght
is
wellhid
but
i
just
wish
it
had
more
pumpkin
flavor
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
the
spice
presence
is
a
little
overwhelming
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
a
very
solid
pumpkin
ale
that
i
will
certainly
buy
next
year
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
falls
slowly
and
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
spices
in
it
mostly
nutmeg
and
clove
some
pumpkin
aroma
but
i
cant
tell
if
its
just
from
the
spices
or
if
its
from
pumpkin
the
flavor
has
a
sharpness
that
i
dont
care
for
one
of
the
spices
is
a
little
too
strong
overpowering
the
others
the
spices
are
very
upfront
perhaps
a
little
too
strong
tastes
like
pumpkin
but
it
could
use
a
lot
more
balance
with
the
spices
because
they
are
just
too
much
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
but
the
drinkability
suffers
from
the
overspicing
flavor
exhibits
the
spices
upfront
but
not
as
fullon
as
the
nose
was
making
me
expect
but
then
the
taste
is
overpowered
by
an
apple
peel
tartness
coupled
with
lots
of
alcohol
burn
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
just
limited
by
the
same
issues
that
i
have
with
the
taste
not
something
i
would
revisit
but
i
still
have
to
admit
it
looked
and
smelled
great
drinkability
pricy
but
ghoulishly
good
heh
heh
the
handsdown
winner
of
this
years
pumpkinfall
beer
halloween
tasteoff
and
the
newest
mustbuy
for
my
annual
october
fix
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
with
the
heavy
spicing
and
alcohol
it
may
be
a
little
too
much
for
some
the
bomber
was
more
than
enough
for
one
sitting
i
love
pumpkin
ales
and
this
one
is
top
notch
and
definitely
recommended
if
youre
not
big
spice
person
id
think
twice
though
clear
coppery
orange
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
left
behind
considerable
lacing
as
it
receded
pie
spice
aroma
cinnamon
nutmet
allspice
with
a
little
fruity
sweetness
that
gives
it
a
definite
pumpkin
character
the
flavour
starts
off
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
with
a
fair
bit
of
fruit
and
some
grassy
hops
pie
spices
kick
in
towards
the
end
and
clove
lingers
in
the
finish
with
a
fruity
sweetness
medium
to
full
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
alcohol
is
completely
masked
quite
nice
whether
its
by
addition
of
pumpkin
or
a
wise
choice
of
yeast
the
fruitiness
in
this
beer
really
carries
the
day
a
lot
of
pumpkin
beers
rely
completely
on
spices
for
their
character
things
seem
better
balanced
here
than
in
most
still
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
pie
spices
this
isnt
going
to
work
for
you
well
done
drinkability
very
good
easy
to
drink
and
share
not
so
powerful
so
as
to
overwhelm
anything
else
you
might
drink
or
eat
afterwards
pours
a
dark
amber
to
copper
color
with
a
tan
cap
that
flattens
to
a
thin
layer
strong
cinnamon
nose
fruity
maybe
orange
and
spicy
esters
very
spicy
like
a
pumpkin
ale
should
be
but
much
richer
here
like
roasted
spices
citrus
and
sour
twang
is
a
little
offsetting
thin
to
medium
body
with
a
full
mouth
that
is
slick
and
cloying
detectable
spices
like
allspice
and
clove
but
difficult
to
discern
between
them
well
blended
spice
are
so
strong
and
rich
they
leave
a
slight
burn
on
the
palate
malts
are
toasty
and
some
caramel
notes
can
be
found
later
in
the
bottle
unfortunately
i
want
able
to
detect
much
pumpkin
character
possible
due
to
the
heavy
spices
but
still
well
balanced
and
a
very
enjoyable
brew
cheers
nice
malt
body
that
is
soon
consumed
by
all
the
spices
very
flavorful
to
the
finish
i
agree
with
the
previous
review
that
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
a
good
froth
livens
up
the
hops
on
the
palate
pours
a
orangy
brown
with
a
tan
head
very
frothy
yet
not
much
smell
mainly
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
is
huge
tons
of
spice
packed
into
this
beer
it
has
a
beer
flavor
to
it
with
all
the
spice
following
right
behind
cinnimon
nutmeg
cardamom
and
cloves
as
stated
on
the
bottle
the
taste
is
definitely
the
best
attribute
to
this
beer
and
is
not
like
anything
i
have
ever
tried
includiing
other
pumpkin
ales
this
one
is
interesting
and
worth
checking
out
especially
if
you
are
into
pumpkin
ales
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
harsh
lots
of
carbonation
not
something
i
could
drink
all
night
the
spices
started
to
wear
on
me
as
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
something
worth
looking
into
enjoy
appropriate
beer
for
the
end
of
october
bright
amber
body
with
copperorange
edges
large
thick
longlasting
head
sugary
malt
nose
with
plums
tropical
fruit

pie
mix
cardamom
cloves
and
nutmeg
nice
toasted
slightly
bitter
hop
profile
up

cake
batter
and
spices
come
on
strong
figs
and
slightly
sweet
vegetal
malt
mix
with
generous
but
not
overpowering
spices
cardamom
nutmeg
vanilla
and
fruity
alcohol
finish
is
warming
with
pumpkin
and
spice
checked
by
a
residual
bitterness
mediumbody
with
a
creamy
feel
i
like
this
more
than
i
thought
i
would
as
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
i
think
the
higher
alcohol
and
malt
sweetness
help
make
the
spices
more
palatable
d
its
good
nothing
amazing
but
probably
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
so
far
up
until
about
30
seconds
ago
smuttynoses
pumkin
was
my
favourite
pumkin
ale
this
is
incredible
lovely
dark
reddish
brown
colour
with
a
huge
sand
coloured
foamy
cap
that
hung
around
for
several
minutes
colossal
pumkin
pie
smell
no
hops
detectable
whatsoever
sweet
malts
pumpkin
cloves
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
delicious
the
flavours
blend
together
so
nicely
and
at
8abv
there
is
a
very
slight
warming
sensation
mouthfeel
is
certainly
full
bodied
but
easy
to
drink
big
thanks
go
out
to
jwc215
for
tossing
this
in
on
a
trade
quite
possibly
my
new
favourite
autumn
seasonal
nice
orangy
hue
with
medium
head
that
leaves
no
lacking
on
the
glass
its
got
a
caramel
and
spice
nose
with
maybe
a
soft
yeast
scent
nicely
sweet
taste
with
the
pumpkin
spice
to
linget
on
the
top
of
your
mouth
alcohol
is
really
only
noticable
when
it
hits
your
belly
not
obvious
in
the
taste
at
all
very
interesting
beer
that
goes
with
the
season
i
wish
i
had
a
slice
of
pie
to
go
with
it
mmmm
pie
appearance
has
a
slightly
hazed
copper
amber
hue
with
a
large
off
white
head
leaves
big
streaks
of
even
lacing
with
each
sip
this
beer
poured
nice
and
thick
aromatics
incllude
heavily
spiced
pumpkin
pie
tones
including
nutmeg
all
spice
and
cinnamon
with
a
notable
cream
layer
and
syrupy
alcohol
sweetness
to
boot
flavor
has
more
sweet
pumpkin
with
heavy
doses
of
spice
completely
covering
the
palate
with
a
mix
of
ripe
fruit
notes
and
alcohol
cinge
mouthfeel
is
syupy
stick
with
sugars
floating
abroad
evenly
carbonated
medium
to
fuller
bodied
pumpkin
ale
not
too
cloying
for
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
drinkability
is
decent
but
im
still
not
big
on
this
dose
of
spice
to
beverage
its
definitely
better
than
most
standard
pumpkin
ales
i
seem
to
enjoy
the
higher
alcohol
versions
better
than
the
cookie
cutter
pumpkin
ales
neat
stuff
a
somewhat
rampedup
version
of
the
style
pleasantly
complex
and
this
would
pair
well
with
its
kindred
pie
or
maybe
a
whole
thanksgiving
dinner
drinkability
pretty
good
this
is
one
saucy
spicy
seasonal
sensation
im
not
shy
about
saying
this
is
my
cup
of
autumnal
gourd
the
spices
are
refreshingly
vivid
the
pumpkin
is
upstaged
but
earthy
and
real
and
the
overall
effect
is
pleasing
and
cozy
if
you
liek
it
itll
go
down
smooth
and
energetically
i
like
it
and
its
a
good
reason
to
look
forward
to
fall
every
year
d
delicious
really
tastes
like
fall
excellent
flavors
very
drinkable
im
glad
to
have
been
sent
2
of
these
will
hope
for
more
in
the
future
highly
recommended
this
is
my
second
pumpkin
beer
after
dfh
and
i
like
this
one
better
the
color
is
darker
amber
and
the
smell
is
all
pumpkin
pie
and
pulls
no
punches
unlike
dfh
this
one
comes
through
with
the
taste
with
clear
clove
cinnamon
and
orange
peel
i
know
pumpkin
is
a
tough
taste
but
i
would
still
like
to
taste
more
of
the
fruit
cant
say
i
would
have
more
than
one
other
than
at
thankgiving
but
a
nice
attempt
at
a
tough
style
thanks
bitterbrian
omfg
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
to
date
thats
a
pretty
heafty
statement
considering
the
amount
of
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
i
think
the
only
one
even
close
to
it
is
the
cottonwood
pumpkin
the
smell
is
so
damn
close
to
a
pumpkin
pie
youd
think
someone
shoved
one
into
the
bottle
the
taste
is
far
superior
to
the
other
pumpkin
beers
not
only
because
the
spices
malts
and
hops
are
balanced
out
so
damn
well
but
youd
never
know
that
it
was
8
this
makes
it
a
dangerous
beer
though
knock
a
few
of
these
bad
boys
back
and
look
out
on
the
other
hand
its
good
for
keeping
you
warm
during
the
cold
october
nights
overall
a
damn
fine
beer
i
just
wish
i
could
get
it
down
in
sc
on
a
regular
basis
deep
chestnut
in
color
thick
white
fluffy
head
holds
well
for
the
size
of
the
beer
there
was
a
nice
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
along
with
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
i
expected
a
bigger
aroma
for
an
imperial
style
darker
malt
flavors
maybe
a
hin
of
licorice
nutmeg
and
other
spices
follow
not
very
clean
as
far
as
flavors
some
anise
as
well
medium
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
i
guess
i
was
expecting
liquid
pumpkin
pie
and
it
fell
short
of
that
very
drinkable
but
not
something
i
will
stock
up
on
definitely
a
seasonal
drink
overall
a
tasty
pumpkin
ale
for
me
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
for
this
style
drinkability
takes
some
getting
used
to
but
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
this
brew
pours
a
deep
reddishcopper
color
with
an
averagesized
white
head
the
aroma
a
mix
of
spice
nutmeg
clove
cinnamon
and
alcohol
behind
the
initial
smells
theres
also
some
lightly
roasted
malt
caramel
and
pumpkin
the
taste
is
strong
with
spice
and
a
strong
hop
bitterness
mingling
with
pumpkin
and
spice
its
not
bad
really
and
is
a
lot
more
intense
than
most
pumpkin
beers
lots
of
clove
which
seems
to
fit
the
beer
appropriately
the
alcohol
has
a
little
warming
quality
after
a
while
its
full
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
the
pumpkin
quality
could
be
stronger
but
overall
i
was
impressed
d
highly
drinkable
pumpkin
top
three
for
me
this
season
glad
i
grabbed
a
few
of
these
another
hit
from
weyerbacher
bomber
into
a
pint
pours
a
medium
red
with
about
a
fingers
worth
of
head
this
beer
is
all
about
the
smell
cloves
cinnamon
nutmeg
its
very
strong
but
in
a
good
way
this
is
an
imperial
remember
follows
through
nicely
in
terms
of
taste
and
mouthfeel
especially
when
compared
to
most
pumpkins
pretty
much
everything
im
always
looking
for
in
a
pumpkin
beer
and
never
quite
seem
to
find
wrap
it
up
in
an
8
abv
package
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
complain
perfect
for
those
chilly
fall
nights
kudos
again
to
weyerbacher
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
is
odd
in
that
it
has
so
many
positive
aspects
and
at
the
same
time
a
whole
bunch
of
unflattering
touches
a
bit
heavy
handed
in
the
clove
category
and
the
hops
seem
a
big
much
as
well
but
overall
a
nice
attempt
it
makes
me
think
if
others
are
trying
the
imperial
pumpkin
aiming
for
more
of
a
big
pumpkin
malty
beer
might
be
better
than
overdoing
the
spice
drinkability

oh
i
can
drink
this
it
just
isnt
the
best
out
there
one
of
these
a
night
could
be
nice
drinkability
a
more
delicious
pumpkin
ale
i
am
having
a
hard
time
thinking
of
it
then
moves
to
a
sweet
malty
cooked
sugar
syrupy
feel
on
the
palate
that
is
balanced
by
a
bitterness
of
acidic
tart
hops
the
finish
is
slightly
boozey
but
not
as
strong
as
expected
from
a
8
brew
this
is
a
great
imperial
pumpkin
delicious
and
satisfies
my
fall
beer
cravings
intriqken
most
certainly
got
this
right
this
beer
certainly
tastes
like
a
homemade
pumkin
pie
i
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
getting
about
an
inch
and
change
of
head
the
head
dissapeared
quickly
and
didnt
leave
much
lace
except
for
the
side
i
poured
towards
the
smell
and
the
taste
are
pure
fall
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
aspects
of
this
season
great
beer
like
this
one
dont
drink
and
review
this
is
good
pumpkin
beer
an
honest
fall
treat
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
pours
a
hazy
deep
amber
a
very
modest
head
which
dissipates
quickly
some
spice
smell
that
leads
to
surprise
as
the
taste
is
much
more
intense
than
one
would
expect
not
overpowering
but
full
of
flavor
not
much
carbonation
but
more
drinkable
than
other
pumpkin
ales
d
they
did
a
good
job
making
this
beer
balanced
it
could
have
easily
been
overspiced
or
too
cloying
flavor
still
leaves
a
tad
to
be
desired
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
drinks
nicely
drinkability
ehhh
no
this
is
not
easy
to
drink
that
aftertaste
is
a
mother
avoid
this
one
overall
a
decent
brew
its
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
cottonwood
still
reigns
supreme
in
my
book
but
it
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
a
good
choice
for
someone
looking
more
for
spice
than
pumpkin
flavor
thanks
to
sacfly
for
the
dfh
bocce
weekend
trade
also
notable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
an
apple
sconce
in
tandem
and
the
flavor
interactions
were
fantastic
highly
drinkable
pumkin
ale
i
love
the
fact
that
theyre
pushing
the
envelope
with
respect
to
abv
compared
to
most
pumkin
ales
though
not
listed
on
this
site
at
the
time
i
write
this
the
weyerbacher
site
says
its
8
weyerbacher
continues
to
come
up
with
great
unique
beers
pours
a
clear
brown
with
highlights
of
copper
a
little
more
than
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
smells
like
a
spicy
pumpkin
pie
loads
of
nutmeg
cloves
cinnamon
also
noticing
a
little
black
pepper
it
seems
great
pumpkin
flavor
the
spices
are
all
working
well
together
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
almost
seems
like
you
should
put
some
whipped
cream
on
it
and
enjoy
it
for
dessert
this
is
right
up
there
with
a
local
pumpkin
porter
from
four
peaks
as
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
12oz
bottle
brewed
with
pumkin
and
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
cardamon
cloves
a
clear
very
dark
copperorange
ale
with
a
large
light
tan
head
aroma
was
all
about
the
spice
mainly
clove
and
nutmeg
the
pumpkin
was
hiding
quite
effectively
until
almost
the
end
of
the
beer
hops
were
fairly
strong
and
the
malt
was
barely
noticeable
with
everything
else
going
on
finally
you
got
a
definate
whiff
of
alcohol
taste
moves
away
from
the
aroma
in
that
the
malt
was
quite
prevalent
a
sweet
dark
bread
type
of
flavor
this
was
easily
the
sweetest
of
the
4
pumpkin
ales
i
tried
in
this
session
the
hops
were
secondary
but
quite
present
at
the
finish
this
combined
with
the
spices
and
a
peppery
aftertaste
gave
a
pretty
good
bite
at
the
end
other
tasting
notes
included
alcoholmedicinal
flavors
clove
and
mint
to
me
a
pumpkin
flavor
was
not
really
in
the
mix
but
you
picked
it
up
a
little
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
fairly
light
carbonation
and
creamy
alcohol
made
for
a
rather
drying
finish
overall
i
didnt
care
for
the
alcoholmedicinal
notes
and
i
think
they
tried
to
do
a
little
too
much
with
this
one
not
sure
we
need
an
imperial
pumkin
ale
but
hats
off
to
them
for
trying
gingerbread
men
with
buttons
made
of
cloves
and
hopflower
hats
are
dancing
in
a
shower
of
holiday
spices
before
putting
on
a
synchronized
swimming
spectacle
in
a
pool
of
pumpkin
pie
filling
this
is
perfect
wow
talk
about
nailing
it
is
it
november
yet
all
i
can
think
about
is
which
foods
i
want
to
pair
with
this
beer
and
a
thanksgiving
feast
fits
the
bill
the
mouthfeel
bolsters
the
experience
further
as
alcohol
warms
the
inside
cheeks
and
is
even
tingly
at
times
goodness
gracious
me
why
is
this
so
drinkable
even
though
my
sips
are
moderate
in
size
they
are
frequent
in
occourence
beers
like
this
one
make
me
feel
great
all
over
and
really
work
out
my
smile
muscles
if
i
had
this
with
turkey
id
enter
suspended
animation
and
wake
up
with
the
black
bears
damn
maybe
i
do
like
pumpkin
beers
this
poured
a
hazy
gorgeous
orange
red
with
a
small
foamy
tan
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
as
hell
it
is
really
cinnamony
loads
of
pumpkin
pie
like
flavor
the
nutmeg
is
also
strong
the
taste
is
quite
malty
with
lots
of
spice
and
a
small
amount
of
hop
flavor
to
balance
the
alcohol
is
simply
not
detectable
with
all
the
awesome
autumness
that
is
going
on
here
the
mf
is
slick
kinda
moderate
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
i
will
have
to
stock
up
all
in
all
i
wouldnt
pass
it
over
if
offered
but
i
would
still
buy
a
dfh
punkin
ale
or
a
smuttynose
instead
nice
dark
orange
brown
beer
crowned
with
a
light
brown
head
lots
of
fun
spice
and
malt
in
the
nise
great
pumpkin
notes
nutmeg
cinnamon
all
the
good
stuff
you
can
tell
theres
alcohol
from
the
warmth
but
not
the
taste
a
whole
lot
of
pumpkin
spice
and
malty
sweetness
get
together
and
play
nice
a
real
delight
on
tap
like
sucking
down
a
fantastic
pumpkin
ice
cream
lots
of
flavor
but
not
overpowering
or
cloying
very
creamy
and
smooth
again
like
the
ice
cream
almost
finishes
remarkably
clean
for
such
a
big
beer
with
so
much
flavor
theres
some
hops
too
but
not
apparent
until
you
belch
a
little
up
yum
its
even
good
the
second
time
around
worth
a
try
but
maybe
not
a
rebuy
overall
i
was
so
excited
to
try
this

i
had

a

and
it
was

drinkability
for
this
started
off
great
then
i
crossed
that
out
and
went
to
good
then
crossed
that
out
too
at
first
i
was
really
into
this
one
but
the
longer
it
sat
and
the
more
i
drank
the
less
i
liked
it
still
one
of
the
most
interesting
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
smooth
and
pretty
welldone
compared
to
its
peers
another
overspiced
pumpkin
brew
i
keep
trying
them
and
they
keep
disappointing
me
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
pumpkin
ale
im
usually
not
a
big
pumpkin
ale
fan
but
this
one
seemed
a
curiosity
being
that
it
was
an
imperial
im
really
glad
i
gave
it
a
go
this
will
certainly
become
a
fall
staple
and
something
to
look
forward
to
when
the
leaves
start
changing
cheers
well
compared
to
the
bottle
i
reviewed
a
few
weeks
ago
which
i
had
aged
in
my
cellar
since
05
this
years
version
definitely
is
showing
its
youth
bright
and
lively
perfume
type
flavors
overwhelming
nutmeg
and
all
spice
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
even
things
out
a
bit
but
i
think
this
years
could
have
benefited
from
more
malt
backbone
especially
the
mouthfeel
there
is
so
much
going
on
in
this
its
absurd
extremely
complex
and
will
be
great
cellared
a
year
when
everthing
comes
together
a
little
better
otherwise
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
dthis
has
become
a
new
staple
in
the
fall
for
me
i
am
going
to
go
buy
a
bunch
if
they
have
hit
what
a
great
beer
d
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
with
the
slightr
little
chemical
bits
in
there
it
leaves
me
a
little
let
down
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
rddish
mahogny
with
a
giant
tan
foamy
head
a
very
impressive
looking
beer
the
smell
is
very
pungent
with
cinnamonnutmegand
real
pumpkin
the
taste
is
creamy
and
like
the
smell
has
cinnamonnutmeg
and
real
pumpkinnot
the
artifiacial
flavoring
i
hate
pumpkin
beersbut
this
is
pretty
good
the
mf
is
light
and
well
balanced
making
this
along
with
football
something
to
look
forward
to
every
fall
pretty
good
flavors
a
bit
powdery
due
to
the
heavy
spice
profile
with
just
a
slight
detection
of
the
8
abv
unique
but
nothing
that
draws
me
into
having
another
glass
i
really
liked
the
electric
sour
tingle
to
this
one
it
really
worked
well
with
the
spices
and
helped
compliment
the
pumpkin
the
taste
again
is
quite
spicy
and
the
cardamom
really
pops
which
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
other
spiced
beers
nutmeg
cloves
and
cinnamon
are
all
in
the
background
along
with
just
a
hint
of
pumpkin
flavor
i
wouldnt
call
it
overly
spicy
but
the
spices
do
dominate
the
slightly
sweet
malty
body
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
creamyand
i
dont
detect
much
alcohol
on
the
palate
so
drinkability
is
fairly
high
d
this
beer
resides
on
the
fringes
of
the
pumpkin
ale
category
largely
due
to
its
magnitude
both
in
alcohol
content
and
its
flavor
profile
with
these
points
in
mind
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
fantastic
harbinger
of
the
tastes
and
smells
of
autumn
and
early
winter
wonderful
for
a
chilly
evening
as
we
count
down
the
days
to
halloween
overall
i
love
weyerbacher
so
im
a
bit
biased
but
i
could
drink
this
all
night
i
think
or
at
least
til
i
fell
over
its
getting
to
be
that
time
of
year
againi
am
not
a
fan
of

spice
to
me
is
just
to
big
flavor
wise
the
pumpkin
flavors
as
light
as
they
are
are
just
overwhelmed
by
spices
nutmeg
and
mace
mainly
with
notes
of
cinnamon
and
clove
as
well
the
point
is
the
spice
flavor
are
just
a
little
to
big
for
this
beer
everything
else
the
nose
and
appearance
are
top
notchdamn
its
so
close
to
being
great
the
body
reminds
me
of
apple
cider
its
very
dark
with
an
almost
orange
tinge
the
head
was
around
an
inch
thick
nose
is
full
of
nutmeg
cinamon
but
not
really
any
pumpkin
to
speak
of
when
i
taste
i
taste
pretty
much
those
same
spices
but
hardly
any
pumpkin
dont
get
me
wrong
it
tastes
good
but
i
feel
like
im
watching
taxi
driver
with
no
deniro
mouth
is
rich
and
creamy
i
definitely
like
this
beer
and
would
love
to
try
it
again
i
just
wish
it
had
more
pumpkin
flavor
than
it
does
i
had
reviewed
this
beer
when
it
was
first
released
and
enjoyed
it
but
was
not
overly
impressed
with
it
at
the
time
i
just
tapped
a
bottle
today
on
my
birthday
and
was
a
bit
more
impressed
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
orangered
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
aroma
still
has
a
nice
cinnamon
and
clove
smell
even
after
sitting
in
my
fridge
since
halloween
the
taste
is
equally
spicey
there
are
tones
of
cinnamon
and
clove
and
pumpkin
but
the
pumpkin
is
not
overwhelming
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
so
i
will
havve
to
sit
on
some
of
them
and
see
how
they
develop

time

thanks
blithev
a

solid
pumpkin

a
nice
treat
to
be
shared
if
and
whenever
possible
although
i
can
see
why
some
people
dont
like
it
it
can
border
on
the
love
it
or
hate
it
line
of
character
for
some
to
each
their
own
mine
is
thimbs
up
as
is
the
mrs
who
probably
liked
it
alot
more
then
i
did
good
stuff
d
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
weyerbacher
yet
although
both
decadance
and
insanity
are
definitely
competition
the
flavor
is
pronounced
yet
not
overbearing
it
is
too
strong
to
session
at
8
0
abv
but
a
bomber
of
this
will
treat
you
pretty
well
definitely
a
fabulous
dessert
beer
or
even
a
nice
apperteif
beers
like
this
are
why
i
love
weyerbacher
ive
had
this
one
sitting
around
for
a
while
and
just
never
had
the
urge
to
drink
it
figured
i
better
get
to
it
before
it
gets
too
old
golden
brown
color
with
a
very
thin
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
smell
of
cloves
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
tons
of
other
spices
very
nice
smell
i
wast
thinking
i
would
like
this
but
its
not
overpowering
like
i
was
anticipating
the
spices
fill
your
nose
as
you
drink
but
the
malt
really
dominates
the
tongue
overall
a
nice
beer
much
better
than
i
was
anticipating
kind
of
a
novelty
beer
that
i
wouldnt
drink
very
often
but
surprisingly
pleasant
got
this
in
a
trade
but
i
do
not
know
who
sent
it
lost
my
trading
papers
but
a
big
thanks
goes
to
the
person
who
sent
this
when
i
popped
the
cap
to
this
beer
i
got
a
big
whiff
of
cloves
poured
an
nice
honey
with
a
light
brown
head
that
didnt
last
and
left
no
lacing
aroma
pumpkin
pie
and
all
the
spices
that
go
with
it
cinnamon
nutmeg
flavor
same
as
the
aroma
with
malts
as
a
topping
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
thrown
in
nice
and
smooth
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
i
think
this
could
even
be
creamier
and
still
be
very
appealing
to
nonpumpkin
beer
drinkers
but
stillt
his
is
far
and
away
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
also
the
most
pumpkin
tasting
ok
i
actually
like
this
beer
i
didnt
think
i
did
the
firs
time
i
had
it
but
its
grown
on
me
cloudy
copper
brown
good
inital
head
that
recedes
quickly
smells
very
sweet
like
honeyed
spiced
pumkpin
pie
or
maybe
even
a
little
artificial
like
one
of
those
holiday
candles
not
awful
though
bam
the
spices
really
hit
you
hard
up
front
with
the
pungecny
of
the
clove
and
nutmeg
packing
the
biggest
wallop
you
dont
get
a
while
lot
of
earthiness
from
pumpkin
but
you
do
get
alot
of
sugar
and
therefore
alcohol
and
sweetness
really
velvety
smooth
mouthfeel
its
an
afterdinner
beer
make
no
mistake
big
and
malty
and
heavily
spiced
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
the
22
oz
bottle
i
had
in
a
sitting
and
probably
would
prefer
about
10
oz
but
it
was
good
if
you
like
spiced
beers
body
is
above
medium
with
coarse
carbonation
and
a
creamy
rich
texture
definately
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
out
there
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
a
good
beer
but
more
of
a
nightcap
than
a
drinking
beer
overall
a
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
to
share
amongst
good
friends
sitting
next
to
the
fireplace
segues
perfectly
with
the
winterxmas
seasonals
also
a
cheek
warmer
for
sure
very
very
nice
this
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
nice
copper
color
the
head
was
descent
but
did
not
last
very
long
the
smell
was
pleasant
very
nicely
spiced
the
taste
is
intially
enjoyable
but
the
spices
eventually
become
a
bit
oveverwhelming
this
is
a
rather
good
pumkin
ale
worth
giving
a
try
enjoy

color

and

i
like
this

im
not

if
its
all

imperial
of
a

id

rather

taste
hops

in
my
brew
so
this
style
ever
has
been
one
on
my
favorites
however
this
one
has
some
added
alcohol
punch
and
the
flavors
are
fairly
well
rounded
and
meshed
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
worth

not
convince
me
that
pumpkin
ale
is
anything
other
than
a
halloween
night
novelty
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
wont
be
everyones
cup
of
pumpkin
juice
but
its
mine
i
applaud
the
willingness
of
the
brewery
to
aim
high
and
to
give
those
of
us
interested
in
this
style
something
to
chew
on
pushing
the
envelope
sometimes
results
in
nothing
more
than
paper
cuts
in
this
case
it
works
thanks
to
beerbeing
for
the
bomber
happy
halloween
this
was
a
dark
amber
beer
with
little
head
and
moderate
lacing
the
spiciness
of
the
aroma
immediately
gotmehints
of
clove
cinnamon
pepper
and
nutmeg
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
and
bland
i
have
to
be
honest
the
taste
was
disappointing
the
flavor
was
mild
at
best
bitter
hoppiness
rounded
out
what
started
as
pure
spice
maybe
i
need
to
sample
more
pumpkin
ales
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
wanting
to
try
one
for
the
first
time
drinkability
i
really
really
dig
this
beer
the
alchol
is
extremely
wellhidden
especially
for
8
it
makes
no
sense
to
me
but
its
great
nonetheless
great
for
fall
or
winter
and
i
kind
of
want
to
get
a
case
of
this
definitely
pick
up
some
if
you
see
it
to
try
especially
if
youre
a
pumpkin
ale
fan
and
thanks
to
blitheringidiot
beer
is
good
happy
pumpkin
spice
beering
drinkability
notes
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
and
compares
favorably
to
dogfish
punkin
ale
id
like
to
have
these
sidebyside
for
a
real
comparison
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
dfh
just
a
bit
more
definitely
a
drinkable
brew
though
id
get
this
again
burnt
orange
in
color
poured
with
very
little
head
that
soon
disappeared
very
tasty
the
spices
were
evident
especially
the
cloves
and
the
pumpkin
taste
prevailed
maybe
im
to
familiar
with
the
balance
of
the
dfh
punkin
head
because
this
was
just
a
bit
washed
out
still
as
stated
below
it
is
very
drinkable
for
such
a
high
abv
pumpkin
ale
this
was
probably
my
second
favorite
pumpkin
ale
this
season
pours
a
bright
reddish
orange
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
and
decent
retention
smell
is
very
strong
and
very
nice
with
the
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
ginger
pumpkin
spices
all
coming
through
nicely
with
just
a
hint
of
pumpkin
as
well
where
the
pumpkin
is
barely
detectable
in
the
nose
it
really
jumps
out
and
asserts
itself
in
the
flavor
with
a
very
spicey
finish
full
of
the
aforementioned
spices
and
white
pepper
medium
bodied
with
a
very
smooth
and
dry
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
a
little
spicey
at
times
but
definitely
one
id
have
again
i
definitely
like
this
better
than
buffalo
bills
pumpkin
beer
but
it
really
does
not
seem
like
anything
more
than
a
supped
up
version
of
that
beer
a
tad
more
spice
more
malt
sweetness
which
gives
this
a
much
better
balance
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
actual
pumpkin
character
all
these
go
to
making
this
a
better
beer
than
buffalo
bills
but
i
would
like
to
see
more
focus
on
the
actual
pumpkin
character
mouthfeel
is
awesome
chewy
full
bubbly
just
really
alive
on
the
tongue
highly
drinkable
a
bit
sweet
after
a
few
but
the
first
couple
are
easy
to
get
down
too
easy
now
overall
certainly
in
the
upper
half
of
the
ten
or
so
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
this
year
and
i
appreciate
the
stab
at
something
a
little
more
muscular
in
the
style
could
use
a
bit
less
spice
and
a
bit
more
pumpkin
though
overall
this
was
quite
the
enjoyable
brew
would
i
crack
open
more
than
one
in
a
night
maybe
but
probably
not
with
that
said
theres
probably
no
pumpkin
ale
that
i
would
often
drink
four
12
oz
bottles
of
in
one
night
which
is
obviously
just
about
the
equivalent
of
two
of
these
bombers
would
i
go
back
to
this
one
in
the
autumn
months
you
bet
give
it
a
try
and
enjoy
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
crisp
and
smooth
at
the
start
and
finish
the
finish
is
long
on
the
spice
the
drinkability
is
down
as
the
overwhelming
spiciness
tires
your
tastebuds
looks
great
smells
great
but
goes
downhill
from
there
a
slight
bitterness
somewhere
mixed
in
not
sure
if
it
is
hops
or
some
other
taste
but
whatever
it
is
it
prevents
this
beer
from
being
cloying
which
happens
a
lot
in
this
style
mouthfeel
is
very
rich
very
rich
bready
and
very
spicy
spiciness
lasts
well
after
the
swallow
in
this
one
perhaps
too
long
left
a
very
dry
spice
laden
taste
in
the
mouth
much
like
a
saison
not
overly
woth
having
a
few
smells
of
clove
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
in
that
order
the
taste
however
begins
with
a
strong
cinnamon
and
ends
slowly
with
cardamom
and
hints
of
clove
crisp
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
smooth
and
slightly
thin
in
the
sip
but
substatial
in
the
swallowing
a
rather
drinkable
beer
perfect
with
a
meal
or
desert
applicable
to
the
season
i
could
imagine
having
two
or
three
of
these
in
a
night
of
drinking
notes
found
this
at
from
the
vine
near
polaris
columbus
oh
had
to
reserve
a
bottle
as
this
sells
before
its
stocked
not
bad
for
5
99
this
one
kinda
blows
a
shame
too
as
it
sounded
so
good
i
always
give
these
new
weyerbacher
brews
a
whirl
but
they
so
often
dissapoint
me
horribly
its
a
shame
too
as
this
brewery
really
is
hit
or
miss
and
when
they
are
on
they
are
on
like
at
the
last
open
house
anyways
a
dull
glowing
orangeamber
with
an
offwhite
dirty
dishwater
head
that
dies
quickly
and
leave
minimalistic
lacing
aromas
are
like
vegetable
soup
dms
abounds
and
some
spices
try
to
cover
it
up
but
fail
badly
like
dfh
punkin
ale
when
it
is
a
year
old
and
has
been
bathing
in
the
sun
taste
is
not
much
better
thin
with
an
artificial
sweetness
and
spiciness
as
well
as
those
vegetal
notes
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
not
too
appealing
drinkability
is
blah
ill
always
try
new
weyerbacher
brews
as
sometimes
they
really
impress
however
sometimes
their
new
beers
are
nothing
to
speak
of
this
is
one
of
the
latter
try
it
once
to
quench
your
curiosity
and
than
move
on
move
on
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
one
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
once
i
doubt
if
i
will
repeat
i
just
could
not
taste
the
pumpkin
not
sure
what
the
problem
is
here
but
it
really
just
seems
that
all
that
spice
was
thrown
in
to
cover
up
something
were
the
pumpkins
bad
i
dont
know
i
dont
want
to
know
like
i
said
one
bottle
is
more
than
enough
thats
my
curiosity
satisfied
drinkability
appropriate
for
the
time
of
year
but
it
gets
a
little
old
after
a
while
nice
to
enjoy
while
watching
some
college
football
but
probably
wont
be
sampling
this
again
any
time
soon
nowhere
close
to
what
i
consider
the
golden
standard
of
pumpkin
ales
punkin
ale
by
dfh
this
is
overly
hopped
overly
spiced
and
in
general
overly
done
i
was
fairly
happy
with
this
beer
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
i
just
picked
up
randomly
as
part
of
a
buildyourown
6pack
but
overall
this
seems
like
a
decent
beer
russet
brown
and
red
tinge
dissipated
tan
head
tar
allspice
cinnamon
clove
baked
molasses
yams
upfront
with
cola
backend
not
bad
when
i
had
this
particular
beer
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
in
the
fact
that
it
differed
from
the
standard
pumpkin
ale
into
more
of
a
standard
aboveaverage
proof
sort
of
lager
12222014
overall
decent
pumpkin
porter
wish
the
flavors
were
more
assertive
and
the
body
thicker
and
with
just
a
bit
more
bite
but
its
not
terrible
by
any
means
it
just
seems
to
miss
the
mark
by
a
hair
a
porter
great
for
the
fall
season
it
has
a
great
aroma
a
lighter
body
for
a
porter
but
it
is
a
porter
that
everyone
could
enjoy
2
or
3
of
the
pumpkin
is
more
in
the
aroma
than
the
flavor
great
smell
but
tastes
like
a
porter
not
much
pumpkin
taste
o
i
think
porters
and
stouts
are
a
great
starting
point
for
pumpkin
beers
this
is
a
good
porter
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
just
wish
the
pumpkin
flavor
was
a
little
stronger
lots
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
ginger
and
allspice
in
the
aroma
along
with
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
coffee
like
you
would
expect
with
a
porter
very
dark
brown
murky
decent
light
brown
head
with
tiny
bubbles
sips
leave
a
good
amount
of
lace
on
the
sides
nearly
opaque
dark
brown
with
hints
of
ruby
onefinger
dense
tan
head
and
modest
lace
bitter
at
the
start
with
a
sweet
caramelly
finish
i
find
the
sweet
almost
too
much
hint
of
sour
from
the
pumpkin
medium
body
not
as
thick
as
i
would
expect
slight
carbonation
long
finish
overall
i
liked
it
but
if
i
made
one
change
it
would
be
to
tone
down
the
sweetness
a
little
i
think
it
was
a
bit
less
sweet
last
year
the
best
pumpkin
porter
ive
had
overall
tastes
good
but
could
be
sooo
much
better
if
you
like
pumpkins
and
porter
this
is
the
beer
for
you
this
brews
not
bad
at
all
and
in
fact
becomes
a
load
more
enjoyable
as
it
warms
and
reveals
more
flavors
its
good
and
the
type
of
beer
one
could
drink
many
of
drinkable
but
its
not
the
best
porter
i
have
had
nor
is
it
the
best
pumpkin
ale
this
is
a
very
nice
pumpkin
porter
the
spices
are
present
but
blend
in
well
with
a
solid
porter
alcohol
is
exceptionally
wellhidden
nicely
done
a
delicious
pumpkin
porter
lighter
body
and
less
syrup
than
most
porters
ive
had
spices
are
present
but
not
overwhelming
would
drink
again
first
wow
what
a
great
brew
i
picked
up
two
from
kroger
i
knew
that
alaskan
had
some
good
stuff
like
the
black
ipa
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
as
good
but
it
was
even
better
i
wont
review
the
astmo
because
the
adjuct
hippie
covered
it
well
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
a
case
update
after
drinking
it
again
next
to
lucky
buckets
oktoberfest
this
beer
is
2nd
to
my
favorite
during
fall
season
now
what
a
beer
overall
a
satisfying
and
mostly
balanced
pumpkin
ale
dumped
this
into
a
goblet
and
it
pours
pretty
viscous
very
dark
brown
with
redtinged
edges
head
doesnt
last
very
long
aroma
is
leathery
and
herbal
heavy
molasses
and
spice
flavor
brings
some
additional
smoky
notes
and
the
website
it
says
they
use
malt
smoked
with
alder
wood
to
achieve
that
also
spice
dominantly
cinnamon
but
i
cant
say
i
notice
any
actual
pumpkin
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
thick
and
almost
too
sweet
especially
if
you
let
it
warm
too
much
i
wouldve
liked
less
sweetness
and
obviously
more
pumpkin
for
a
pumpkin
ale
however
i
actually
think
it
tastes
good
really
bold
flavors
just
no
pumpkin
and
is
it
even
a
porter
honestly
think
its
closer
to
some
abbey
ales
ive
had
than
to
a
porter
good
stuff
for
a
nonpumpkin
abbey
ale
pumpkin
porter
all
in
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
i
thought
the
porter
base
worked
well
with
the
pumpkin
pie
flavors
and
i
thought
the
smokey
aspect
worked
well
with
it
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
a
little
prickly
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
one
would
be
my
limit
since
i
think
the
mouthfeel
would
start
to
wear
on
me
after
having
more
than
one
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
it
was
just
were
it
needed
to
be
and
no
aspect
was
too
overpowering
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
this
beers
weakest
point
and
it
needs
some
work
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
any
pumpkin
beer
fans
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
just
made
it
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
other
than
that
it
was
a
nice
beer
this
is
now
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
think
its
up
there
as
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
good
job

this
was

about

with
relatively

get

the

this

i
really
enjoy
these
styles
of
beers
i
think
this
is
a
solid
attempt
at
a
pumpkin
porter
and
it
has
a
nice
touch
of
pumpkin
spice
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
great
balance
of
pumpkin
and
spices
with
the
traditional
porter
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
dark
bread
fantastic
this
could
grow
on
me
but
at
first
tasteits
kind
of
wild
the
porter
part
is
not
bad
but
the
aftertaste
is
all
over
the
place
strong
barrel
tasting
bitter
then
disappears
into
a
watery
nothingness
i
can
get
the
pumpkin
flavor
though
if
you
didnt
know
it
was
a
pumpkin
beer
itd
be
hard
to
place
the
flavor
overall
another
winner
from
alaskan
if
you
like
a
little
subtlety
and
balance
in
your
beers
you
should
enjoy
this
understated
pumpkin
porter
if
you
want
a
big
beer
in
intensity
of
flavors
or
heavy
mouthfeel
or
abv
youll
have
to
look
elsewhere
good
solid
pumpkin
porter
body
is
medium
which
is
surprising
based
on
the
abv

of
both
chocolate
and

spicing
a
quality
pumpkin
beer
combined
with
a

basea
quality
beer
overall
a
good
porter
with
pumpkin
in
it
that
ill
be
sure
to
buy
more
of
alaskan
has
brewed
a
very
well
spiced

the
heavy

work

have

to

of
the

into
the
remaining

down

taste
is
much
the

with
earthy
pumpkin
and
slight

flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
roasty
and
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
spice
presence
that
is
fairly
subdued
all
around
the
taste
exposes
all
of
the
pumpkin
spices
you
can
want
with
an
emphasis
on
the
cinnamon
while
the
malty
porter
characteristics
fall
slightly
behind
but
are
forward
enough
to
be
noticed
and
enjoyed
a
very
nice
beer
wortha
a
try
indeed
for
a
limited
run
brew
as
i
got
the
last
one
where
i
bought
this
one
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
softsmooth
12
and
foamy
12
mouthfeel
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
and
lips
o
a
pretty
straight
forward
pumpkin
porter
does
exactly
what
youd
expect
i
really
enjoy
these
i
feel
that
the
robustness
and
sweetness
of
the
roasted
malt
stands
up
well
to
all
the
pumpkin
spice
and
really
balances
it
nicely
simple
but
very
tasty
overall
well
balanced
porter
with
a
well
blended
mix
of
spices
where
none
are
overwhelming
but
all
are
apparent
i
could
drink
this
all
day
poured
into
a
reubens
brew
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
half
finger
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
of
sweet
toasted
malt
chocolate
light
pumpkin
and
pie
spices
flavor
is
light
toasted
malt
brown
sugar
pumpkin
and
pie
spicing
finishes
with
light
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
hops
light
to
medium
bodied
somewhat
light
for
a
porter
a
nice
combination
of
dark
malts
and
pumpkin
with
nicely
handled
spices
but
a
bit
light
in
flavor
and
finishes
with
a
whisper
of
flavor
i
expected
a
lot
from
the
brewers
of
the
classic
smoked
porter
but
the
body
of
this
seems
lighter
and
less
interesting
a
pleasant
well
balanced
but
light
flavored
pumpkin
porter
an
interesting
excursion
for
the
holidays
worth
seeking
out
bet
this
one
hits
the
spot
on
a
cold
november
night
in
juneau
t
kind
of
mild
flavors
going
on
here
pumpkin
upfront
cinnamon
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
finish
kind
of
dies
and
shows
a
bit
of
watery
malt
but
not
much
else
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
of
better
things
out
there
overall
very
tasty
beer
only
thing
i
would
really
change
would
be
to
thicken
it
up
a
bit
overall
this
is
pretty
tasty
like
most
pumpkin
ales
though
this
isnt
something
i
would
drink
very
often
o
alaskans
pumpkin
porter
is
a
ridiculously
smoothbodied
beer
that
incorporates
soft
pumpkin
and
spice
into
a
more
mildly
roasted
porter
with
undertones
of
chocolate
and
mocha
for
a
very
nice
blend
of
styles
i
say
congratulations
to
alaskan
on
this
brew
those
looking
for
the
biggest
baddest
boldest
as
i
often
do
might
not
agree
but
i
think
they
kind
of
threaded
a
needle
using
a
fairly
straightforward
recipe
aside
from
the
pumpkin
and
achieving
some
really
nice
balance
and
synergy
from
the
ingredients
i
think
it
coulda
been
a
flop
but
they
got
it
right
pretty
sure
they
did
some
smaller
practice
batches
before
turning
this
loose
upon
reading
my
praise
please
note
that
i
have
no
problem
pummeling
ak
brewing
with
fairly
harsh
criticism
when
i
feel
it
is
deserved
they
are
the
closest
large
craft
brewery
to
me
and
i
have
often
complained
that
they
are
too
tame
with
some
exceptions
but
with
this
one
the
tame
worked
and
i
think
there
is
some
skill
in
the
brew
room
facilitating
this
success
o
i
find
this
to
be
a
thin
and
somewhat
uninteresting
porter
for
the
base
beer
the
spices
are
not
overdone
but
the
pumpkin
is
a
bit
lost
in
the
other
aromas
and
tastes
personally
id
rather
have
a
good
porter
without
the
pumpkin
and
spices
any
day
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
some
slight
red
around
the
edges
one
finger
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
with
spice
is
somewhat
muted
by
the
dark
roasted
malts
the
flavor
is
dark
roasted
malts
chocolate
a
little
hops
on
the
finish
with
again
muted
pumpkin
spices
under
it
all
mouth
feel
is
typical
porter
maybe
on
the
lighter
side
but
nice
over
all
i
like
this
beer
it
tastes
like
a
chocolate
porterstout
with
pumpkin
spices
a
nice
change
from
the
standard
dark
beer
overall
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
the
spices
come
through
the
most
but
there
is
a
nice
smokey
malt
presence
i
have
been
real
into
pumpkin
stuff
this
year
and
pumpkin
dark
beers
intrigue
me
like
no
other
never
seen
this
one
before
so
i
grabbed
it
up
for
around
8
or
9
bucks
a
bomber
it
pours
very
dark
flat
black
with
a
lazy
and
short
lived
mocha
colored
head
it
smells
very
different
from
others
ive
had
there
is
no
sweetness
at
all
despite
being
brewed
with
brown
sugar
i
can
taste
it
but
it
doesnt
make
the
beer
sweet
i
absolutely
adore
that
feature
its
unique
and
it
makes
this
a
hit
immediately
the
pumpkin
is
there
cloaked
in
rich
chocolate
malt
and
a
gentle
but
detectable
spicing
its
got
an
almost
chalky
feel
not
quite
so
dry
but
a
little
gritty
on
the
palate
nice
for
autumn
its
pretty
steady
drinking
but
the
buzz
comes
on
a
little
harder
than
most
beers
around
7
abv
for
some
reason
fuller
bodied
it
could
use
another
notch
of
carbonation
but
i
almost
like
it
a
little
still
the
whole
pilot
series
from
alaskan
has
been
wonderful
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
in
it
a
must
try
for
pumpkin
lovers
a
decent
take
on
the
pumpkin
beer
sweet
with
light
roast
cocoa
its
similar
to
southern
tiers
warlock
but
at
only
60
i
have
to
say
upfront
that
i
dislike
pumpkin
beer
in
general
that
however
is
not
why
i
dislike
this
beer
so
intensely
i
am
astonished
that
a
brewery
thats
usually
so
consistent
as
alaskan
could
put
out
something
so
abominable
especially
in
light
of
their
smoked
porter
which
is
very
very
good
o
a
solid
beer
overall
a
bit
heavy
on
the
spices
but
still
enjoyable
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
has
a
sweet
aftertaste
another
nice
beer
from
alaskan
brewing
one
of
the
most
underrated
breweries
in
the
country
in
my
opinion
o
pumpkin
leans
vegetal
which
i
guess
is
good
for
authenticitys
sake
but
it
sure
doesnt
float
my
boat
on
this
beer
porter
is
a
stretch
for
sure
decent
overall
overall
good
aroma
and
taste
but
the
sugary
finish
and
off
mouthfeel
pull
it
down
too
bad
really
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
brews
they
went
further
with
the
bold
flavors
and
sweet
malt
and
even
though
this
is
totally
crazy
i
think
it
works
pretty
well
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bottleworks
in
seattle
it
was
like
thanksgiving
dessert
in
a
bottle
it
looked
like
the
top
of
a
slightly
carmelized
pumpkin
pie
smelled
like
the
oven
it
was
baking
in
tasted
like
the
aforementioned
carmelized
part
with
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
like
pumpkin
pudding
i
love
it
another
winner
from
juneau
based
on
what
was
written
on
the
bottle
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
was
definitely
a
good
porter
but
it
didnt
have
any
spicy
notes
i
was
expecting
nor
the
sweetness
i
was
expecting
from
something
that
claimed
to
be
flavoured
with
brown
sugar
the
flavour
was
mostly
that
of
a
typical
porter
it
had
coffee
and
cocoa
notes
a
moderate
sweetness
it
was
on
the
thin
side
but
thats
typical
in
america
where
beers
labeled
as
porters
tend
to
be
slightly
thinner
than
those
labeled
as
stouts
despite
this
thinness
the
pumpkinness
in
the
brew
seemed
to
primarily
serve
as
a
fortification
of
the
yeast
character
it
gave
sort
of
a
false
impression
of
a
thicker
beer
than
it
actually
was
the
yeast
and
hint
of
pumpkin
flavour
came
together
very
well
in
this
sense
i
also
wasnt
overwhelmed
at
all
by
the
bitterness
of
roasted
malt
or
cocoa
flavour
this
might
have
been
where
the
brown
sugar
came
in
it
didnt
taste
especially
sweet
but
there
may
have
been
some
sugar
at
play
to
fight
off
excessive
bitterness
it
was
definitely
a
good
allaround
porter
but
there
was
nothing
pumpkiny
about
it
up
front
not
the
sweet
pumkinpie
flavour
i
was
expecting
the
brown
sugar
advertised
was
barely
noticeable
so
if
you
want
to
enjoy
it
drink
it
when
youre
craving
a
good
hearty
porter
not
when
you
want
a
sweet
pumpkin
pie
treat
there
wasnt
even
much
in
the
way
of
pumpkinstyle
spices
cocoa
and
coffee
flavours
dominated
lighter
bodied
and
flavored
than
i
expected
from
this
porter
its
an
ok
beer
but
i
had
higher
hopes
for
it
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
porter
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
on
the
whole
i
think
this
is
a
fine
beer
its
bold
in
approach
but
doesnt
go
overboard
its
about
as
solid
as
you
could
hope
for
a
pumpkin
porter
in
my
opinion
a
tasty
pumpkin
porter
really
the
only
style
of
pumpkin
beer
that
i
really
enjoy
and
this
one
is
well
done
not
a
dominant
pumpkin
flavor
but
more
of
an
allspice
pumpkin
pie
character
blended
well
with
the
roasty
porter
base
it
was
everything
i
expected
being
advertised
as
a
pumpkin
porter
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
distinguishable
ultimately
this
is
a
tasty
porter
if
you
are
going
to
have
810
ounces
and
move
on
more
than
that
becomes
a
challenge
o
bring
on
the
autumn
season
im
gonna
enjoy
this
fine
brew
from
alaskan
as
long
as
it
is
in
town
one
of
the
best
pumkins
ive
ever
had
02222015
one
of
my
favorite
beers
a
very
odd
beer
for
me
the
pour
was
a
nice
amber
color
with
an
off
colored
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
was
full
of
wood
with
hints
of
caramel
and
vanilla
however
there
was
not
much
pumpkin
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
heavy
on
the
wood
with
then
a
bit
of
pumpkin
and
brown
sugar
on
the
end
enjoyable
but
not
very
well
balanced
had
this
at
gabf
in
2014
great
bourbon
yes
pumpkin
not
much
i
love
there
base
beer
its
my
dessert
at
most
dinners
when
available
i
bought
this
as
my
wife
is
a
huge
pumpkin
fan
and
this
was
no
pumpkin
letting
a
few
sit
in
the
basement
to
see
if
the
bourbon
will
chill
out
and
the
veg
will
come
thru
tbd
the
pumpkin
and
spice
hit
me
first
followed
by
the
hint
of
bourbon
no
head
of
note
deceptively
easy
to
drink
for
a
10
but
a
fine
ale
for
christmas
night
here
in
offaly
ireland
an
above
average
bourbon
pumpkin
ale
it
doesnt
have
much
to
flavor
of
pumpkin
as
it
is
masked
by
the
bourbon
however
its
still
a
solid
brew
obetter
than
i
was
expecting
but
for
the
price
a
try
it
and
never
have
it
again
very
smooth
pumpkin
ale
a
nice
seasonal
pumpkin
ale
a
bit
boozy
but
fitting
for
colder
days
a
small
artificial
note
cheap
kind
of
bourbon
underneath
it
all
but
covered
smartly
by
the
spices
o
bottom
line
this
is
a
simple
beer
that
i
like
this
is
not
a
complex
beer
you
get
an
amber
ale
with
pumpkin
flavors
and
an
bourbon
barrel
bite
and
i
like
it
more
than
most
it
seems
when
i
saw
all
the
pumpkin
or
harvest
or
seasonal
beers
offered
at
tw
i
thought
pumpkin
and
ale
just
sounds
wrong
well
a
friend
gave
me
this
one
i
didnt
notice
the
abv
until
i
tasted
it
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
alcohol
then
the
second
mouthful
revealed
complexity
and
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
came
through
oak
vanilla
and
caramel
balanced
with
pumpkin
spices
and
just
a
touch
of
each
makes
a
nice
flavorful
ale
i
really
wouldnt
want
stronger
pumpkin
spice
flavors
this
is
very
nice
i
would
buy
this
but
a
six
will
last
awhile
recommended
o
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
on
some
levels
but
is
uneven
in
others
there
are
definitely
worse
examples
of
the
style
out
there
i
liked
this
beer
because
its
a
bit
different
from
other
pumpkin
beers
i
like
the
barrel
aging
its
goes
some
rough
edges
but
most
of
the
beers
from
alltech
do
the
taste
echoes
the
cinnamon
of
the
aroma
but
the
pumpkin
spice
is
somewhat
muted
yet
it
is
there
enough
for
one
to
know
they
are
drinking
a
pumpkin
spice
i
did
not
get
much
in
the
way
of
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
but
overall
i
thought
it
was
pretty
vibrant
and
tasty
beer
full
of
flavor
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
glass
snifter
sweet
flavor
with
a
definitive
alcohol
kick
the
pumpkin
comes
through
in
the
swallow
rich
body
and
an
equally
low
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
more
alcohol
and
sweet
malt
short
lived
low
b
o
a
different
but
good
take
on
traditional
pie
spice
pumpkin
beers
but
lacks
in
some
areas
excellent
aroma
smells
exactly
like
what
it
says
on
the
bottle
the
generic
sweetness
would
be
better
replaced
by
a
dark
caramel
to
complement
the
bourbon
along
with
an
increase
on
the
spices
one
of
the
better
beers
that
uses
a
sour
pumpkin
flavor
medium
dark
amber
color
big
cinnamon
aroma
with
a
hint
of
fruit
fruity
pumpkin
taste
some
spice
flavor
its
good
overall
alltechs
brews
have
been
ok
but
this
one
is
tops
for
me
cinnamon
clove
and
brown
sugar
dominate
the
oakiness
comes
on
strong
as
the
beer
warms
one
of
the
better
beers
from
this
brewery
the
original
bourbon
ale
may
be
the
only
beer
they
make
that
i
prefer
to
this
one
an
interesting
brew
for
one
o
not
bad
an
interesting
mix
for
sure
i
like
my
pumpkin
a
bit
more
like
a
pie
flavor
and
this
deviates
a
bit
overall
its
solid
but
not
great
disappointing
i
thought
that
pumpkin
and
bourbon
barrels
were
going
to
be
a
pretty
good
mix
but
it
might
just
be
poor
execution
the
flavor
was
a
bit
too
strong
on
the
pumpkin
not
enough
on
the
bourbon
surprisingly
crisp
would
have
thought
there
would
have
been
a
heavier
body
as
well
like
most
bourbon
ales
the
color
was
nice
a
hazy
amber
very
good
looking
beer
with
a
mild
white
head
overall
was
really
hoping
for
something
better
its
official
not
every
beer
or
ale
tastes
better
from
bourbon
barrels
overall
i
like
it
get
the
pumpkin
flavor
up
and
it
would
be
a
total
winner
i
like
it
and
would
recommend
it
for
sure
just
like
the
standard
ale
from
kentucky
this
adds
some
nice
spice
notes
very
tasty
but
not
something
i
can
drink
constantly
id
imagine
it
would
mix
great
with
the
same
types
of
beers
as
the
standard
bourbon
barrel
ale
i
plan
to
try
mixing
with
a
vanilla
porter
very
soon
o
my
preferred
pumpkin
beers
taste
like
the
pie
and
this
one
delivers
nice
pumpkin
smell
as
you
open
the
bottle
pours
golden
copper
as
you
would
expect
a
bit
strong
but
at
10
abv
that
was
a
given
flavor
is
amazing
with
smooth
pumpkin
and
then
the
mild
bourbon
finish
very
very
nice
with
amazing
quality
a
bit
expensive
but
happy
to
have
tried
it
i
grabbed
a
mixed
6pack
of
various
seasonals
just
for
fun
i
had
low
expectations
for
this
one
considering
i
was
less
than
impressed
with
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
i
can
admit
when
im
wrong
when
it
comes
to
pumpkin
ales
i
like
a
good
one
but
they
dont
exactly
excite
me
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
can
see
it
being
a
bit
strong
for
some
but
not
me
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
while
i
can
o
a
good
pumpkin
beer
stock
up

o
pleasantly
surprised
their
bourbon
barrel
ale
and
stout
are
both
somewhat
underwhelming
so
i
set
my
expectations
accordingly
but
this
was
a
fine
pumpkin
ale
assuming
you
enjoy
the
likes
of
pumking
greater

the

update
well
that
took
about
20
minutes
to
figure
out
the
last
bottle
was
doomed
its
nearly
midnight
and
i
have
a
long
day
tomorrow
but
in
a
carpe
diem
mentality
i
am
enjoying
this
last
bottle
right
here
right
now
so
heres
to
all
of
you
who
fly
in
the
face
of
reason
for
the
love
of
one
more
awesome
craft
beer
slainte
impressive
beer
right
here
i
went
through
all
the
pumpkins
left
in
the
fridge
last
night
and
this
was
by
far
the
most
enjoyable
of
the
beers
i
had
it
has
a
pale
golden
color
really
light
for
a
pumpkin
beer
a
nice
white
head
with
great
clarity
and
sparkle
and
a
wonderful
nose
of
oaky
bourbon
barrels
very
gentle
spice
and
a
unique
sweetness
the
taste
profile
is
very
well
refined
so
much
going
on
here
but
not
dominant
spice
or
gross
overripe
pumpkin
flesh
its
all
perfectly
put
together
my
girlfriend
tasted
carrot
cake
and
frosting
and
upin
close
examination
i
had
to
agree
with
her
this
has
a
light
and
delicate
pumpkin
side
and
a
delicate
sweetness
with
just
enough
baking
spice
the
oak
adds
a
lot
vanilla
and
smoothness
to
the
whole
thing
one
of
the
lighter
pumpkin
ales
in
color
and
flavor
that
ive
had
and
also
one
of
the
best
hidden
alcohol
strengths
in
the
beer
world
my
first
beer
from
these
guys
is
very
impressive
great
use
of
spice
and
barrel
im
going
to
have
to
get
a
whole
lot
more
of
these
next
fall
o
a
bit
sweeter
than
expected
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
bourbon
flavor
but
overall
pretty
enjoyable
for
a
style
that
hasnt
been
tried
often
pours
a
golden
amber
with
a
creamy
but
thinnish
foam
cap
some
lacing
delicious
nose
of
pumpkin
clove
allspice
cherries
is
reminiscent
of
the
taste
of
pumpkin
pie
with
a
slight
bit
of
cherry
pie
mixed
in
taste
right
away
is
vanilla
pumpkin
nutmeg
cherry
a
light
sweetness
ties
it
together
medium
body
creamy
mouthfeel
its
clear
that
this
is
a
pumpkin
beer
from
the
spices
however
these
are
lightly
applied
to
good
effect
mingling
with
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
cherry
element
from
the
bourbon
aging
no
noticeable
alcohol
lightly
sweet
but
a
dry
finish
big
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
as
well
as
bourbons
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
from
trying
many
examples
of
this
style
i
simply
dont
think
that
barrel
aging
a
pumpkin
ale
works
in
the
least
bit
the
spices
and
pumpkin
flavors
do
not
mesh
with
the
notes
that
the
barrel
adds
didnt
like
taste
is
heavy
on
the
pumpkin
and
spices
and
smooth
i
dont
sense
much
of
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
here
so
a
second
bottle
may
be
in
order
the
high
abv
also
isnt
too
apparent
though
this
definitely
is
a
flavorful
and
heavy
brew
enjoyable
and
begging
for
a
revisit
overall
a
decent
beer
and
a
nice
unique
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
i
only
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
more
substantial
and
the
flavors
a
little
more
defined
it
is
all
just
a
little
bit
of
a
mess
overall
the
woman
at
the
liquor
store
suggested
this
one
to
me
i
am
i
only
bought
one
bottle
o
the
spicing
is
ample
but
the
barrel
aging
does
a
good
job
of
reigning
it
in
the
base
beer
still
seems
overly
sweet
it
works
but
the
balance
is
tenuous
at
best
good
as
a
sipper
the
barrel
flavors
work
like
comfort
food
o
not
bad
doesnt
warrant
the
price
tag
but
a
decent
take
on
a
bb
pumpkin
beer
o
a
beautifully
barrelaged
pumpkin
beer
this
light
and
drinkable
brew
might
actually
be
too
drinkable
slyly
inserting
high
alcohol
into
its
smooth
lighter
body
and
soft
warming
finish
the
pumpkin
isnt
over
the
top
either
so
if
youre
looking
for
something
thats
not
pie
in
a
glass
this
one
is
for
you
this
is
a
solid
imperial
pumpkin
ale
the
bourbon
is
subtle
but
gives
it
another
dimension
its
enjoyable
o
overall
this
beer
is
a
unique
twist
on
a
pumpkin
beer
with
nice
notes
from
the
barrel
aging
glad
i
tried
this
one
not
nearly
as
cloying
as
the
bba
which
is
good
and
the
pumpkin
detracts
from
the
vanilla
dominance
a
little
hot
and
the
sour
note
is
offputting
but
will
probably
age
well
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
kentucky
bourbon
barrel
ale
is
fantastic
and
this
gave
it
an
interesting
and
tasty
twist
looks
like
they
added
the
pumpkin
and
spices
to
an
already
great
ale
and
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may
the
results
were
outstanding
great
brew
for
the
season
o
i
really
appreciate
the
beer
these
guys
are
dishing
out
makes
me
proud
of
our
state
of
kentucky
there
bourbon
is
awful
and
needs
improvement
but
hey
if
their
bourbon
is
contributing
barrels
for
brews
like
pumpkin
barrel
to
be
aged
in
then
by
all
means
keep
pumping
it
out
but
i
wont
be
buying
the
bourbon
i
will
look
for
the
kentucky
pumpkin
barrel
every
fall
though

kentucky
pumpkin
barrel
ale
is
a
warm
welcome
to
the
palates
of
central
kentucky
and
beyond
where
it
shies
away
from
the
overthetop
intensity
of
other
high
gravity
pumpkin
ales
it
has
a
subdued
palate
and
profile
that
makes
it
highly
drinkable
compared
to
its
high
alcohol
content
dangerous
from
sip
to
finish
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
this
beer
is
great
up
until
the
mouthfeel
just
very
light
otherwise
everything
i
look
for
in
a
pumpkin
beer
mildly
spiced
its
a
good
beer
worth
a
try
but
not
much
more
pours
with
a
white
small
head
has
a
dark
golden
color
the
smell
has
an
awful
stench
of
bad
squash
rather
than
pumpkin
thankfully
it
doesnt
taste
as
it
smells
the
pumpkin
is
prevalent
but
not
overwhelming
combing
well
with
the
brewed
spices
clear
light
pumpkinorange
color
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
of
spiced
pumpkin
pie
cool
and
refreshing
i
personally
would
say
this
is
your
average
seasonal
pumpkin
ale
with
more
dry
spice
than
actual
true
pumpkin
flavor
very
seldom
do
you
get
a
pumpkin
ale
that
tastes
like
pumpkin
and
is
not
overpowered
with
dry
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
unfortunately
this
beer
falls
into
the
dry
spice
category
overall
feels
ok
and
the
balance
is
not
that
bad
average
beer
not
so
good
that
i
expected
caramel
tone
pours
a
filtered
polished
copper
with
a
thin
slightly
offwhite
head
aromas
of
pumpkin
spices
nutmeg
all
with
a
slight
chemical
tinge
to
it
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
light
pumpkin
light
maltiness
with
a
light
vanilla
finish
feels
a
bit
manufactured
and
lacking
a
naturalness
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
overall
very
good
pumpkin
beer
focused
a
lot
of
the
spices
that
are
normally
associated
with
pumpkin
rather
than
pumpkin
directly
however
the
pumpkin
still
deserves
top
billing
as
the
interplay
between
the
earthy
pumpkin
and
the
spices
makes
this
a
very
tasty
beer
that
advocates
should
try
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
with
the
hops
kind
of
interesting
the
unexpected
hop
forwardness
is
not
a
bad
thing
just
not
what
i
expected
from
a
pumpkin
ale
o
not
a
bad
pumpkin
the
biscuit
malts
are
actually
an
interesting
mix
in
with
the
pumpkin
o
i
would
have
liked
a
tad
more
hops
a
little
less
brown
sugar
and
maybe
not
quite
as
dry
but
these
are
things
to
quibble
over
overall
the
beer
is
tasty
and
goes
very
well
with
beef
stew
i
might
add
it
isnt
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
would
be
happy
to
have
it
again
far
more
positives
than
negatives
kudos
to
brooklyn
brewery
o
i
like
the
subtlety
of
the
pumpkin
and
spices
in
this
one
the
finish
was
a
bit
too
dry
for
me
but
overall
not
bad
great
mild
pumpkin
with
little
sweetness
and
easily
drinkable
just
okay
many
other
pumpkin
ales
out
there
that
are
better
you
are
not
getting
the
whole
pie
here
just
subtle
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
sitting
on
top
of
a
very
nice
ale
i
could
call
this
a
session
pumpkin
ale
i
had
3
of
these
on
tap
in
a
row
before
and
during
dinner
at
skinflints
in
bay
ridge
brooklyn
last
night
i
have
not
had
another
pumpkin
ale
that
would
bear
up
to
repeated
servings
and
also
not
interfere
with
a
diners
food
enjoyment
well
done
brooklyn
as
a
beer
it
is
okay
as
a
pumpkin
beer
it
is
outstanding
bottle
from
the
warehouse
pours
amber
color
with
offwhite
head
aroma
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
malt
and
pumpkin
taste
of
pumpkin
pie
with
bitter
hops
and
nutmeg
at
the
end
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
very
nice
i
found
this
really
disappointing
after
the
bros
had
given
it
a
87
lighter
than
most
ales
had
it
on
draft
really
light
with
subtle
hints
of
pumpkin
and
spices
very
smooth
just
not
a
lot
of
flavor
i
like
seasonal
beers
full
of
flavor
and
i
expect
my
pumpkin
ales
to
taste
at
least
a
little
like
pumpkin
pie
this
was
an
easy
ale
to
drink
and
you
could
drink
several
even
after
a
hot
day
of
mowing
grass
not
bad
just
too
light
and
lacking
of
that
fall
punch
of
spices
overall
this
is
an
acceptable
pumpkin
ale
that
bears
many
of
the
hallmarks
of
the
style
but
it
doesnt
do
much
to
distinguish
itself
from
the
finer
examples
of
the
style
e
g
whole
hog
yummy
dark
orange
color
lots
of
pumpkin
flavor
with
hints
of
cinnamon
on
the
back
end
enjoy
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
an
average
at
best
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
it
had
most
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
but
in
the
end
the
flavors
that
needed
to
stick
out
the
most
and
be
showcased
didnt
and
that
made
for
a
bland
and
uninteresting
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
watery
crisp
slightly
prickly
not
filling
at
all
and
the
taste
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
another
one
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
seemed
to
be
pretty
true
to
style
and
it
wasnt
as
light
as
some
of
the
other
aspects
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
they
were
both
just
too
light
and
they
made
me
lose
interest
fast
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
easy
to
find
a
much
better
pumpkin
ale
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
either
since
i
think
its
just
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
all
in
all
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
it
left
me
wanting
more
in
just
about
every
aspect
and
it
just
wasnt
memorable
so
far
this
is
my
least
favorite
beer
from
brooklyn
brewery
and
its
on
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
i
appreciate
the
effort
and
that
you
guys
didnt
go
crazy
with
the
spices
but
in
the
end
this
beer
just
wasnt
for
me
better
luck
next
time
guys
a
very
pleasant
pumpkin
beer
pours
a
golden
yelloworange
with
a
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
full
of
pumpkin
in
the
beginning
but
then
reverts
to
a
lot
of
spice
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
taste
was
refreshing
with
a
lighter
taste
than
most
pumpkin
beers
but
still
having
a
good
amount
of
flavor
for
the
price
point
i
thought
it
was
a
great
buy
overall
though
pumpkin
ales
are
not
my
favoured
style
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
i
have
comes
across
to
date
the
price
is
okay
too
at
around
au65
a
case
of
24
x
330ml
2014
not
much
pumpkin
or
pumpkin
spice
flavor
but
its
a
nice
ale
that
i
really
enjoyed
still
searching
for
the
perfect
pumpkin
ale
but
this
one
isnt
it
im
new
to
pumpkin
ales
i
must
admit
but
i
started
with
wayerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
perhaps
that
set
the
bar
very
high
for
me
because
this
ale
is
not
even
close
to
wayerbacher
it
is
pleasant
dont
get
me
wrong
but
its
watery
and
not
nearly
spicy
enough
i
will
finish
my
six
pack
and
never
get
it
again
i
love
brooklyn
brewery
i
really
do
but
this
one
is
not
so
great
not
much
to
this
beer
and
i
fail
to
detect
the
pumpkin
flavor
at
all
o
after
having
some
great
pumpkin
beers
this
one
is
falling
towards
the
bottom
of
the
pack
just
not
enough
spice
to
back
up
the
weird
flavors
in
this
slightly
sour
note
lots
of
clove
and
cinnamon
ginger
way
too
spicy
for
my
liking
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
truly
fantastic
a
ton
of
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
so
excited
that
its
pumpkin
season
again
so
i
can
get
more
of
these
not
offensive
in
any
way
mild
sweet
pumpkin
aroma
with
muted
spices
smooth
clean
taste
with
crisp
mediumhigh
carbonation
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
vanilla
are
detectable
but
just
barely
decent
light
pumpkin
ale
but
probably
not
one
ill
buy
again
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
and
worth
a
try
when
all
the
fall
beers
appear
the
spices
are
not
overdone
and
pumpkin
flavor
is
there
easy
drinking
and
flavorful

it

everything

pumking
was
a

take
it
down

it

5after
having
pumking
for
the
first
time
last
night
o
always
a
nice
reason
to
enjoy
the
return
of
fall
post
road
is
a
quality
pumpkin
ale
that
has
stayed
consistent
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
sweet
notes
at
first
that
are
balanced
by
the
earthy
pumpkin
elements
towards
the
end
this
beer
has
a
bit
of
the
grit
of
pie
crust
but
it
is
not
overly
sweet
people
looking
for
a
beer
that
tastes
like
the
dollop
of
cream
on
top
of
a
pumpkin
pie
would
not
love
this
because
the
earthy
pumpkin
is
more
at
work
in
this
beverage
the
spices
are
present
but
are
a
little
more
in
the
background
that
other
pumpkin
beers
since
the
spices
compliment
more
than
star
post
road
is
more
restrained
overalltheres
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
but
its
not
that
bad
overall
very
good
pumpkin
ale
o
a
good
fall
beer
as
metioned
previously
not
as
pumpkin
pie
forward
as
i
might
hope
for
but
still
a
solid
offering
id
love
to
have
a
big
mug
of
this
beer
to
sip
on
all
night
yum
i
would
call
this
a
very
good
introductory
pumpkin
beer
their
isnt
an
overwhelming
spice
or
pumpkin
flavor
but
enough
of
both
to
fit
into
the
style
just
not
enough
of
what
i
personally
look
for
in
this
style
however
tastes
like
liquid
pumpkin
pie
distinct
spice
taste
of
nutmeg
or
cinnamon
i
look
forward
to
this
one
each
september
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
a
very
meek
and
timid
pumpkin
i
feel
like
your
opinion
of
this
beer
will
largely
be
determined
by
how
you
feel
about
the
vanilla
taste
with
each
sip
i
get
more
and
more
vanilla
which
could
be
cloying
to
some
but
pleasantly
reminds
me
of
pumpkin
pie
and
vanilla
ice
cream
bottle
light
orange
in
color
the
beer
sported
a
tall
foamy
white
head
just
average
aroma
there
is
a
very
light
pumpkin
aroma
but
little
in
the
way
of
spices
and
malt
the
taste
is
interesting
at
first
but
does
not
finish
well
with
a
spicy
tanic
aftertaste
medium
carbonation
i
did
not
like
the
first
bottle
i
tried
but
after
three
on
different
days
i
am
starting
to
see
what
they
are
trying
to
do
it
is
also
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
but
it
still
good
and
unique
in
that
it
is
not
overly
malty
not
bad
for
a
pumpkin
beer
meh
its
not
bad
but
its
not
great
seeing
as
along
with
blue
moon
and
shock
top
this
was
the
only
pumpkin
ale
i
have
been
able
to
find
in
this
town
i
will
probably
get
more
before
the
end
of
the
fall
but
there
are
much
better
examples
out
there
o
good
pumpkin
ale
not
the
best
i
have
had
but
highly
drinkable
looking
forward
to
finishing
the
rest
in
the
6pack
thank
you
brooklyn
brewery
overall
comes
across
as
a
heavily
spiced
english
pale
ale
so
this
is
probably
a
more
traditional
take
on
the
style
quite
tasty
notes
this
is
only
my
2nd
pumpkin
ale
the
1st
being
southern
tiers
pumking
what
a
contrast
while
the
latter
is
an
in
your
face
pumpkin
shotgun
blast
that
obliterates
any
trace
of
beer
in
the
glass
post
road
is
a
pale
ale
with
some
spices
and
pumpkin
added
this
is
drinkable
and
interesting
i
am
not
sure
if
pumpkin
ale
will
ever
be
more
than
a
change
of
pace
or
novelty
for
me
but
post
road
could
be
a
beer
that
i
could
have
a
few
of
in
the
fall
o
good
falltime
beer
its
pumpkin
piey
but
tastes
like
beer
i
think
this
beer
is
the
good
middle
ground
between
the
liquid
pumpkin
pies
and
beers
which
happen
to
have
pumpkin
in
them
sessionable
and
definitely
worth
a
6pack
poured
copper
in
color
with
some
orange
highlights
a
head
fails
to
develop
but
a
ring
of
foam
and
some
surface
film
cap
present
a
nicelooking
brew
the
aroma
is
simple
but
aromatic
and
pleasant
spicing
is
faint
with
post
road
nutmeg
is
most
present
followed
by
clove
toasted
malts
along
with
pumpkin
give
this
beer
a
unique
roasted
pumpkin
seed
aroma
as
well
taste
is
maltforward
with
toasty
and
caramel
malts
up
front
spicing
is
again
minimal
on
the
palate
but
lingers
in
the
finish
lightmedium
body
with
crisp
carbonation
overall
subtle
and
not
overdone
it
offers
something
different
than
a
lot
of
other
pumpkin
beers
out
there
i
love
me
a
good
pumpkin
beer
and
this
is
almost
as
good
as
it
gets
the
appearance
isnt
anything
special
just
has
a
gold
color
with
barely
any
head
the
smell
has
a
lot
of
pumpkin
scent
and
spices
now
the
taste
is
where
it
is
at
i
drink
it
and
just
screams
pumkpin
pie
you
get
the
strong
pumpkin
taste
and
spices
such
as
nutmeg
this
is
a
decent
pumkpin
beer
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
and
a
solid
autumn
offering
that
malt
flavor
tends
to
stay
instead
of
the
spices
which
is
actually
a
bad
thing
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
but
the
clove
or
nutmeg
was
a
little
strong
the
beer
has
a
really
nice
mix
of
cinnamon
sugar
and
pumpkin
and
it
is
not
overwhelming
at
all
i
cant
imagine
anyone
being
disappointed
drinking
this
on
a
chilly
october
evening
o
a
good
wellrounded
pumpkin
beer
more
spice
in
the
flavor
would
have
bumped
this
one
up
quite
a
bit
for
me
o
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
year
excellent
smell
that
is
right
on
with
the
taste
o
pretty
good
wish
it
lived
up
to
the
smell
ill
be
sticking
with
punkin
if
i
feel
like
a
pumpkin
beer
not
bad
but
not
great
the
flavor
profile
is
much
milder
in
my
opinion
than
other
pumpkins
on
the
market
o
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
out
of
this
one
and
wont
be
buying
it
again
o
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
my
biggest
complaint
with
this
one
is
you
dont
really
taste
the
pumpkin
still
looking
for
that
perfect
pumpkin
beer
tastes
like
beer
o
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
the
spices
arent
overwhelming
which
is
a
plus
but
that
doesnt
leave
a
ton
left
either
light
to
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
nothing
too
special
but
still
a
nice
balanced
pumpkin
ale
all
around
o
if
taste
followed
nose
more
this
beer
would
rock
its
still
decent
but
i
loooove
pumpkin
bombs
when
it
comes
to
be
this
time
of
the
year
its
also
a
bit
too
light
for
my
liking
may
revisit
but
with
schlafly
in
my
market
it
may
not
be
anytime
sooni
love
this
season
for
beer
o
i
love
this
and
i
expect
nothing
but
that
from
brooklyn
im
going
to
have
to
get
a
few
more
of
these
a
great
start
to
the
fall
beer
season
o
nice
pumpkin
ale
not
too
over
the
top
like
others
balanced
in
flavor
overall
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
but
not
really
a
good
one
either
pretty
standard
fare
that
you
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
and
you
would
get
bored
so
you
move
on
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
fall
beers
i
have
ever
had
this
is
one
that
i
am
going
to
drink
every
fall
forever
pumpkin
ale
lovers
beware
your
beer
has
arrived
this
is
my
go
to
pumpkin
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
when
comparing
to
similar
sessionable
type
pumpkin
beers
nose
smells
like
autumn
lots
of
spices
nutmeg
and
of
course
pumpkin
in
the
taste
the
pumpkin
is
more
profound
a
natural
dry
style
of
pumpkin
taste
not
the
artificial
flavoring
style
pours
cloudy
orange
color
small
white
head
lighter
side
of
medium
in
the
mouthfeel
in
comparison
with
other
pumpkin
beers
this
one
takes
the
win
in
my
opinion
i
can
name
a
number
of
other
breweries
that
try
and
make
pumpkin
beers
but
either
the
flavor
or
the
mouthfeel
just
isnt
right
this
pours
an
amber
orangish
color
this
pours
a
white
head
the
smells
of
pumpkin
and
spices
some
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
feel
is
medium
to
light
taste
is
a
little
bitter
hops
or
pumpkin
i
also
get
some
pumpkin
and
the
spices
this
is
only
my
third
pumpkin
beer
and
i
guess
the
bitter
afterflavor
is
in
many
of
them
ill
probably
come
back
and
reevaluate
this
after
i
have
a
different
ones
for
comparison
sake
anyways
not
bad
different
than
expected
something
ill
try
again
overall
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
that
is
worth
the
try
recommended
as
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
not
a
bad
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
as
with
pretty
much
all
pumpkin
beers
i
only
need
one
in
a
night
pours
a
clear
pumpkin
orange
color
with
a
2
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
actual
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
especially
cinnamon
and
clove
taste
is
of
malt
and
pumpkin
pie
mixed
together
a
very
nice
blend
of
beer
and
pumpkin
pie
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
from
brooklyn
with
a
very
nice
balance
of
flavors
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
one
of
these
o
interesting
flavor
my
first
pumpkin
ale
was
tasty
and
i
would
have
another
overall
its
a
good
fall
beer
with
good
balances
not
too
strong
and
overwhelming
but
also
refreshing
its
an
easy
drinking
enjoyable
crisp
pumpkin
ale
this
one
started
out
great
but
really
lets
you
down
in
the
end
by
the
way
has
anyone
looked
at
that
photo
is
that
the
inside
leg
of
someones
jeans
this
might
be
a
good
contender
for
a
very
drinkable
spice
beer
othing
heavy
but
well
balanced
and
tastey
but
it
is
not
pumpkiny
enough
overall
it
was
decent
its
mostly
just
some
pumpkin
that
never
really
makes
its
way
to
the
forefront
the
most
pleasant
part
of
the
taste
was
the
aftertaste
actually
it
wasnt
bad
but
not
great
either
overall
it
was
ok
very
drinkable
and
light
a
nice
light
amber
with
some
spice
and
pumpkin
in
the
back
overall
it
was
poorly
balanced
too
watery
and
too
hoppy
in
comparision
to
others
of
the
same
style
o
a
little
too
much
nutmeg
for
me
to
get
this
again
and
not
a
ton
of
body
on
this
beer
this
is
an
easy
drinking
sessionable
pumpkin
beer
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
at
8sixer
the
biggest
reason
that
it
doesnt
rate
higher
is
the
thin
mouthfeel
i
would
also
like
a
bigger
blast
of
flavor
its
probably
a
bit
underrated
but
hoppin
frogs
double
hollow
pumpkin
is
similar
yet
better
o
this
beer
has
taught
me
that
you
cant
expect
all
pumpkin
ales
to
carry
the
characteristics
of
pumpkin
pie
bread
etc
this
beer
really
focuses
on
the
pumpkin
itself
without
any
help
from
spices
to
add
on
to
anything
its
a
rather
robust
brew
but
for
the
pumpkin
to
be
the
lone
contributor
to
the
overall
taste
and
aroma
makes
for
a
real
stand
out
beer
worth
a
shot
then
another
o
this
is
definitely
on
the
lighter
end
of
the
pumpkin
ales
easy
drinking
crisp
and
bitter
the
spices
tend
to
outweigh
the
overall
beer
with
the
cinnamon
forward
overall
this
beer
smells
great
but
otherwise
does
not
have
a
lot
going
for
it
ill
have
to
revisit
later
in
the
season
nothing
overly
spectacular
but
a
very
solid
pumpkin
ale
glad
i
bought
it
ill
probably
spend
the
rest
of
the
season
trying
other
pumpkinsoctoberfests
but
i
recommend
picking
up
a
6er
of
this
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
non
beer
geeks
to
the
world
of
good
beer
i
didnt
pour
from
the
bottle
didnt
think
it
be
worth
it
i
thought
with
its
age
it
would
be
one
sip
and
drain
but
i
was
wrong
it
was
downright
delightful
tasted
like
pumpkin
pie
more
than
just
the
spices
but
the
actual
pumpkin
too
nice
and
full
bodied
between
the
spices
the
pumpkin
and
the
distinct
breadiness
it
was
awesome
i
wish
pumpkin
ales
werent
relegated
to
a
fall
seasonal
because
this
is
a
great
refreshing
and
flavourful
brew
that
would
appeal
to
ginger
beer
and
american
ipa
fans
this
pumpkin
ale
pours
out
on
the
brown
colored
side
the
head
is
white
it
look
appealing
the
aroma
is
a
little
spicy
nothing
to
intense
the
taste
kind
of
follows
that
trend
there
is
a
spicy
quality
to
the
taste
which
isnt
too
bad
but
i
think
it
lacks
on
the
actual
pumpkin
flavors
a
little
bit
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
its
pretty
decent
its
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
but
still
worthy
of
trying
a
more
subdued
pumpkin
beer
then
others
ive
tried
o
drinkability
is
good
for
the
season
as
i
tend
to
become
tired
of
pumpkin
ales
outside
of
that
twomonth
period
in
the
fall
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
if
going
for
that
picked
up
this
at
a
winebeer
specialty
store
in
montclair
nj
a
bit
overpriced
at
12
bucks
for
a
6
pack
but
very
good
tasting
not
filling
and
not
too
much
of
an
aftertaste
not
a
thick
beer
with
a
real
bitter
taste
that
i
thought
it
would
have
goes
down
pretty
good
hope
i
could
find
this
on
tap
i
look
forward
to
the
lcbo
carrying
more
brooklyn
brewerey
beers
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
is
no
king
decent
beer
that
i
would
sample
and
share
again
this
is
a
consistently
good
pumpkin
beer
as
far
as
a
normal
d
seeing
as
this
is
more
than
a
few
months
after
this
was
released
and
is
lower
in
abv
i
dont
really
know
what
to
say
not
bad
but
was
probably
better
when
it
was
fresh
the
pumpkin
flavor
has
probably
evolved
or
devolved
if
you
will
into
something
different
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
dimpled
glass
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
good
sized
foamy
head
that
leaves
moderate
lacing
nice
aroma
of
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
but
overall
slightly
faint
taste
is
a
little
off
there
is
some
pumpkin
character
up
front
with
a
little
spice
but
it
quickly
disappears
into
a
palelager
type
aftertaste
with
a
bit
of
sourness
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
overall
in
a
tough
category
overall
impression
better
than
some
pumpkin
offerings
but
the
search
continues
for
one
thats
not
just
a
decent
amber
with
entirely
too
many
spices
d
can
you
say
thanksgiving
beer
id
love
to
pair
this
with
some
holiday
favorites
of
mine
d
overall
id
like
to
say
that
post
road
pumpkin
ale
is
an
average
pumpkin
beer
but
it
was
my
least
favorite
of
2010
so
with
that
rationale
in
mind
im
inclined
to
say
that
it
is
well
below
average
the
beer
has
a
nice
dark
orange
color
body
with
a
little
bit
of
white
head
to
it
the
smell
is
very
nice
of
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
it
taste
really
nice
of
pumpkin
and
then
the
spices
come
a
little
bit
after
i
think
it
has
a
nice
smooth
mouth
feel
and
is
very
drinkable
pours
a
semi
dark
clear
orange
colour
with
a
good
amount
of
head
in
the
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
tastes
of
pumpkin
spices
with
a
finish
of
pumpkin
pie
and
cinnamon
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
tougher
to
drink
with
the
average
or
worse
reviews
i
have
read
on
this
beer
but
its
not
overpowered
with
spice
as
people
have
said
in
previous
posts
its
quite
drinkable
im
going
to
have
to
go
against
the
grain
on
this
one
its
just
too
vegetal
for
my
tastes
nothing
against
brooklyn
but
id
take
sts
pumking
any
day
over
this
maybe
ill
revisit
this
down
the
road
but
for
now
ill
stick
to
their
lager
drinkability
is
good
these
are
easy
drinking
sessionable
pumpkin
ales
d
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
maybe
i
am
just
not
a
big
pumpkin
ale
guy
to
be
honest
this
was
hard
to
get
through
not
my
least
favorite
pumpkin
brew
of
the
year
but
certainly
not
among
the
better
ones
either
too
imbalanced
and
spiceheavy
to
really
get
going
a
bit
surprising
considering
brooklyns
brewing
pedigree
drink
probably
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
so
far
this
season
ill
pick
up
a
few
more
for
sure
pours
a
clear
tawny
orange
with
a
rather
unimpressive
soapy
white
head
picking
up
some
spice
and
hints
of
pumpkin
in
the
nose
as
well
as
some
floral
hops
the
taste
follows
the
nice
with
pumpkin
and
spice
which
accent
a
base
of
caramel
and
bready
malt
not
picking
up
any
hops
in
the
taste
the
finish
is
crisp
a
touch
of
lingering
ginger
spice
and
on
the
malty
side
but
no
cloying
sweetness
light
to
mediumbodied
moderately
carbonated
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
the
spices
werent
overpowering
but
i
wouldve
preferred
a
bit
more
hops
to
balance
it
out
i
tried
five
pumpkin
beers
this
season
and
this
one
placed
fourth
or
fifth
i
dont
think
ill
bother
with
it
next
year
d
good
at
5
abv
this
beer
is
definitely
among
the
more
sessionable
pumpkin
ales
o
good
beer
on
flavor
but
on
feel
and
drinkability
it
loses
some
points
with
me
i
had
it
on
tap
at
a
local
restaurant
and
i
believe
it
was
better
there
but
i
wont
go
on
memory
just
what
i
tasted
here
its
an
approachable
pumpkin
beer
with
strong
malt
characteristics
and
hints
of
pumpkin
and
spice
it
was
not
enjoyable
for
me
as
i
found
the
malt
characteristics
imbalanced
when
i
drink
a
pumpkin
ale
i
want
it
to
slap
me
in
the
face
with
post
road
i
find
myself
searching
for
the
pumpkin
and
forgetting
about
the
spice
this
is
a
really
solid
pumpkin
ale
my
third
favorite
after
pumking
and
dfh
pours
a
copper
orange
colour
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
dissipates
to
almost
nothing
fairly
quickly
mild
spots
of
lacing
around
some
of
the
glass
smells
of
cinnamon
clove
allspice
and
nutmeg
i
dont
get
any
pumpkin
really
in
the
smell
but
more
of
the
spices
associated
with
pumpkin
pie
flavour
is
quite
spicy
but
not
as
sweet
as
expected
interesting
flavour
in
that
it
is
more
on
the
spicing
but
not
either
pumpkin
or
pumpkin
pie
not
sweet
enough
body
is
a
bit
thin
just
an
ok
pumpkin
beer
d
started
out
great
but
is
really
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
in
my
opinion
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
and
i
could
actually
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
another
delicious
beer
from
brooklyn
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
pumpkin
beer
overall
there
are
much
better
of
the
style
pass
if
you
have
other
options
the
ale
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
white
head
the
some
retention
the
smell
has
a
faint
but
hop
and
malt
scent
but
it
overwhelmingly
smells
from
pumpkin
pie
spices
nutmeg
corriander
clove
allspice
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
of
the
pumpkin
spices
sugar
and
the
pumpkin
flavor
at
the
end
this
beer
is
inbetween
the
flavors
and
styling
of
dogfish
heads
punkin
and
southern
tiers
pumking
d
good
allaround
pumpkin
ale
although
its
a
tad
too
carbonated
perhaps
still
its
slightly
above
average
in
the
echelon
of
pumpkin
ales
the
taste
of
post
road
pumpkin
is
subdued
while
there
is
pumpkin
spice
sweetness
all
present
it
is
still
an
ale
at
the
core
and
not
overdone
in
its
flavor
profile
with
too
much
of
anything
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
decent
carbonation
this
is
one
pumpkin
ale
that
one
could
drink
a
couple
of
it
very
much
has
a
more
relaxed
character
d
can
drink
a
good
amount
of
these
if
my
palate
agrees
with
the
spicy
aftertaste
for
that
day
def
a
fun
beer
to
drink
for
the
season
and
with
good
home
cooked
meal
turkey
dinner
perhaps
there
isnt
anything
bad
about
this
beer
but
it
just
isnt
what
i
look
for
in
a
pumpkin
beer
pours
a
moderate
brownish
color
with
a
tad
bit
of
a
light
head
nose
brings
a
good
dose
of
spice
and
a
few
hints
of
pumpkin
taste
is
mostly
spice
with
a
bit
of
sugar
and
pumpkin
light
to
medium
body
not
one
of
the
more
extreme
pumpkin
beers
that
i
have
had
but
doesnt
quite
hit
the
level
of
some
of
he
better
versions
this
is
easily
the
highest
rating
ive
given
to
a
bb
beer
yet
so
maybe
now
i
can
finally
be
called
a
homer
d
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
mdthis
one
grew
on
me
im
not
a
fan
of
beer
and
cinnamon
together
but
brooklyn
pulled
it
off
pours
a
dark
amberorange
with
a
quickly
disappearing
pearl
head
nice
looking
despite
the
lack
of
head
pumpkin
spice
aroma
decent
blend
of
scents
nice
pumpkin
flavor
sweet
vanilla
and
pumpkin
up
front
followed
by
the
typical
pumpkin
spices
brown
sugar
cinnamon
and
all
spice
stand
out
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
end
as
well
creamy
and
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
very
pleasant
creamy
and
spicy
mouthfeel
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
it
would
be
conceivable
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
on
a
nice
autumn
eve
had
no
clue
what
to
expect
from
this
one
pours
an
amber
colour
with
a
creamy
thin
head
smell
is
faint
but
definitely
has
notes
of
cinnamon
clove
and
what
i
think
is
malt
the
taste
is
where
this
gets
a
little
odd
it
actually
tastes
more
like
pumpkins
than
spices
which
is
the
opposite
of
most
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
as
i
was
bracing
for
the
nutmeg
kick
most
of
these
ales
have
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
finish
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
almost
too
easy
bordering
on
being
watery
as
others
have
stated
this
beer
is
a
lot
nicer
when
its
allowed
to
warm
up
a
bit
it
mellows
and
more
of
the
overall
flavour
emerges
dont
drink
it
chilled
it
only
amplifies
the
watery
quality
my
distributor
didnt
keep
these
in
the
fridge
i
should
have
followed
suit
but
put
it
away
when
i
got
home
just
let
it
be
mouthfeel
was
fine
and
the
drinkability
form
a
texteure
point
of
view
was
there
it
just
didnt
taste
much
of
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkable
there
is
nothing
that
really
keeps
me
craving
more
but
i
can
easily
drink
a
few
at
a
time
out
of
the
bottle
it
has
a
less
than
good
color
more
of
a
yellow
amber
colored
clear
body
with
a
an
ecru
head
of
1
and
half
fingers
smells
overly
spicy
with
small
hints
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
clove
on
the
nose
and
tongue
with
very
strong
co2
bite
which
i
found
unpleasant
but
shit
i
bought
a
six
pack
and
im
gonna
drink
a
six
pack
i
think
this
may
have
been
my
first
pumpkin
beer
but
it
was
better
that
i
expected
the
style
to
be
i
find
i
prefer
a
much
fuller
body
in
my
pumpkin
ales
with
less
spice
and
more
pumpkin
drinkability
had
this
at
a
local
restaurant
where
i
usually
switch
up
but
stayed
with
this
tasty
d
surprisingly
smooth
for
the
level
of
spiciness
d
its
kind
of
like
a
mix
between
a
pumpkin
and
an
octoberfest
good
but
not
great
d
maybe
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
brew
but
its
not
altogether
too
bad
at
all
ill
revisit
this
one
again
next
year
a
nice
light
pumpkin
ale
with
a
smooth
finish
would
recommend
d
if
you
like
it
im
sure
you
can
down
a
6
easily
id
prefer
to
find
more
pumpkin
maybe
more
spice
and
less
watery
overall
d
not
a
bad
beer
though
would
not
be
my
first
choice
for
a
pumpkin
ale
or
a
fall
beer
in
general
for
that
matter
not
memorable
comapred
to
some
of
the
other
pumpkin
ales
pours
burnt
orange
color
nice
large
head
dissipates
quickly
to
bout
one
finger
cinnamon
apples
some
citrus
lots
of
spice
and
of
course
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
warm
crisp
fall
like
flavor
upfront
not
as
much
pumpkin
in
the
taste
as
some
others
nice
spices
cinnamon
and
still
some
citrus
nice
ale
thickness
to
the
body
with
a
smooth
finish
overall
a
good
ale
not
quite
the
pumpkin
ale
that
i
was
expecting
but
a
good
one
to
try
pours
an
almost
orange
color
nice
and
clear
head
retention
ok
not
crazy
about
the
smell
kinda
medicinal
sharp
and
green
taste
starts
off
bitter
but
then
rounds
out
somewhat
the
finish
is
spicy
and
drinkability
is
decent
an
alright
beer
but
the
flavors
didnt
gel
like
i
wanted
them
to
too
bitter
and
not
enough
pumpkin
flavor
i
seem
to
say
that
about
most
pumpkin
ales
need
to
find
a
good
one
overall
a
mediocre
pumpkin
beer
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
to
begin
with
because
they
seem
to
appeal
to
people
who
dont
like
actual
beer
but
really
just
want
pumpkin
pie
flavored
wine
coolers
and
this
is
one
of
those
i
wouldnt
bother
with
this
one
honestly
ill
actually
buy
a
sixpack
of
this
if
that
tells
you
how
i
feel
about
its
drinkability
big
fan
of
high
abv
pumpkin
ales
but
this
is
an
exceptional
low
octane
example
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
nothing
too
outside
the
normal
but
that
isnt
a
bad
thing
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
probably
couldnt
drink
a
6
pack
as
it
would
probably
ruin
your
palate
with
the
spices
and
become
a
little
much
d
more
then
i
thought
with
the
lack
of
massive
pumpkin
and
spice
but
this
was
rather
pleaset
beer
i
should
have
waited
for
the
carbonation
to
mellow
but
no
beer
should
taste
that
much
like
pure
tonic
light
so
you
think
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
but
the
carbonation
is
difficult
to
accept
all
in
all
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
that
could
use
a
little
more
pumpkin
glad
i
only
bought
one
and
not
a
sixer
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
missing
something
that
keeps
it
from
being
better
than
average
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
somebody
who
sorta
likes
pumpkin
ales
d
easy
to
drink
nice
and
smooth
full
bodied
fall
classic
pumpkin
ale
exception
definitely
a
poor
example
of
the
style
good
some
interesting
unique
things
going
on
here
the
spice
character
is
rich
without
being
overly
sweet
rich
enough
though
to
make
one
enjoy
stop
after
that
a
great
pumpkin
ale
worth
seeking
out
d
this
is
a
pumpkin
ale
for
beer
lovers
my
wife
who
does
not
care
for
beer
and
loves
a
lot
of
the
big
thick
pumpkin
ales
ex
pumking
shlafly
punkin
etc
would
definitely
not
like
this
one
post
road
is
almost
a
faint
echo
of
one
of
those
giant
pumpkin
ales
but
still
very
recognizable
as
a
drinkable
pilsneresque
session
beer
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
this
one
is
closer
to
the
bottom
for
me
its
got
pumpkin
and
spice
but
other
brewers
use
both
in
a
much
better
fashion
post
road
is
middle
of
the
road
only
the
2nd
of
a
series
of
pumpkin
beers
ive
ever
tried
i
found
this
largely
indistinguishable
from
the
first
sample
but
just
a
little
less
impactful
in
every
category
frankly
i
only
drank
about
half
of
it
before
i
drain
poured
this
style
just
isnt
my
thing
i
think
the
spices
overwhelm
any
of
the
other
standard
flavors
or
experiences
you
expect
from
your
beer
and
in
this
particular
case
even
though
they
less
overwhelm
it
because
it
isnt
as
flavorful
as
others
it
just
reveals
a
fairly
lame
beer
at
the
base
of
the
creation
sorry
but
ive
got
to
be
honest
i
love
everything
brewed
by
this
company
so
my
review
may
be
partial
but
this
is
a
great
ale
that
i
could
drink
in
march
as
easily
as
october
serving
type
bottle
extremely
drinkable
for
autumn
too
bad
its
still
in
the
low
90s
here
i
actually
look
forward
to
the
chilly
weather
drinking
this
d
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
not
the
best
but
not
bad
at
all
i
was
kind
of
let
down
by
this
one
it
smelled
great
but
the
taste
really
disappointed
not
enough
pumpkin
and
the
beer
flavor
was
pretty
bland
there
are
other
pumpkin
ales
id
drink
before
this
one
for
sure
i
doubt
ill
revisit
it
this
is
a
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
it
would
go
great
with
pumpkin
pie
or
vanilla
ice
cream
hard
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
had
one
in
the
car
ride
home
then
one
in
my
chimay
goblet
smell
and
taste
could
be
better
wont
buy
it
again
but
if
a
bud
has
some
in
the
fridge
one
day
ill
nab
one
dflavors
stay
but
it
seems
to
get
more
watery
as
it
goes
down
its
not
a
session
beer
or
a
sipper
its
just
something
you
want
to
be
over
with
not
an
in
your
face
pumpkin
beer
by
anymeans
very
drinkable
and
simple
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
d
certainly
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
perhaps
if
the
taste
was
as
strong
as
the
nose
this
would
be
a
better
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
but
i
will
be
sticking
the
others
in
the
future
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
moderate
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
it
wa
a
lighter
and
easy
drinking
beer
it
was
a
lot
milder
of
the
spices
then
a
lot
of
others
which
was
nice
it
wasnt
anything
extraordinary
but
it
was
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
for
the
style
drinkability
is
fairly
decent
as
well
easy
enough
to
quaff
on
a
cool
fall
day
bit
light
on
flavor
and
feel
but
its
by
no
means
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
ive
just
had
better
d
due
to
heavy
mouthfeel
and
high
spice
character
its
a
one
and
done
at
a
time
deal
with
this
pumpkin
brew
d
an
ok
pumpkin
beer
but
with
so
many
others
out
there
not
one
i
would
get
again
some
nice
spice
and
pumpkin
in
the
smell
but
the
taste
wasnt
that
great
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
good
carbonation
and
not
too
heavy
as
far
as
this
style
goes
this
was
on
the
lighter
end
of
beers
very
flavorful
but
nothing
to
overpower
d
there
are
few
pumpkin
ales
that
i
truly
enjoy
and
even
fewer
that
i
will
follow
up
with
a
second
round
this
one
if
definitely
going
to
be
a
repeat
especially
when
it
gets
a
little
colder
outside
this
beer
smells
amazing
which
only
serves
to
highlight
the
disappointing
lack
of
flavor
dm
lighter
than
expected
overall
its
ok
i
have
had
better
pumpkin
beers
and
will
probably
opt
for
those
in
the
future
d
you
could
certainly
consume
multiple
is
a
session
but
im
not
sure
you
would
want
to
d
very
drinkable
a
nice
pumpkin
by
brooklyn
amber
brown
with
thinnish
head
that
is
retained
well
with
a
bit
of
lacing
spicy
pumpkin
pie
aromas
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
all
spice
etc
not
much
pumpkin
spicy
flavor
pumpkin
comes
through
a
bit
more
but
is
still
subdued
compared
to
the
spices
not
bad
but
it
is
a
bit
diluted
with
a
thin
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
needed
a
bit
more
body
and
sweetness
i
think
d
the
beer
was
alright
but
ive
had
better
ones
before
from
this
style
drinkability
this
is
exactly
what
a
pumpkin
ale
should
be
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
i
have
only
had
two
pumpkin
ales
before
one
by
coors
and
one
from
ab
michelob
which
i
did
enjoy
but
this
one
is
obviously
more
flavorful
and
very
enjoyable
it
isnt
fall
yet
but
when
autumn
hits
i
will
be
sure
to
have
some
of
this
available
in
the
fridge
pours
a
clear
light
copper
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
lasts
for
a
minute
or
two
enticing
aromas
of
pumpkin
naturally
and
spices
like
nutmeg
and
cloves
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
that
its
spicy
pumpkin
notes
can
easily
be
tasted
but
doesnt
crowd
out
the
biscuity
malt
flavor
light
brown
sugar
sweetness
and
earthy
bitterness
like
so
many
of
the
lesser
beers
of
this
style
with
post
road
the
pumpkin
features
most
prominently
on
the
nose
and
the
finish
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
sixpackable
pumpkin
ales
and
is
one
along
with
a
selection
of
oktoberfests
that
for
the
past
few
years
ive
kept
on
hand
for
entertaining
fall
guests
poured
into
a
dfh
pint
glass
one
finger
head
that
was
quite
shortlived
but
did
retain
a
slight
to
decent
amount
of
lacing
deep
copperamberorange
coloration
smell
is
maltly
mixed
with
allspice
a
bit
of
nutmeg
pumpkin
and
slight
hint
of
cinnamon
and
clove
taste
was
very
similar
to
the
smell
profile
with
the
malt
and
spices
being
the
most
prominent
pumpkin
taste
lingers
behind
mouthfeel
was
fairly
carbonated
up
front
but
mellowed
out
rather
quickly
carbonation
worked
well
with
the
medium
body
and
slight
creaminess
because
of
that
i
would
consider
it
quite
sessionable
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
orangeamber
with
one
finger
of
white
head
lackluster
retention
modest
lacing
and
decent
amount
of
carbonation
the
nose
was
very
biscuity
malty
and
of
course
not
without
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
the
taste
was
nice
maltycaramelpumpkinspice
blend
with
the
latter
not
overpowering
at
all
and
blending
very
well
in
with
the
maltiness
the
finish
also
revealed
a
herbal
hoppy
presence
nonexistent
in
the
nose
more
carbonated
in
the
feel
than
it
had
initially
appeared
mediumbodied
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
specimen
is
fairly
well
done
not
unsessionable
i
tried
this
beer
on
november
19
2008
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
orangered
with
a
very
thin
very
shortlived
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
pumpkin
and
spicy
notes
cloves
and
nutmeg
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
above
average
carbonation
the
flavour
was
primarily
malty
with
some
definite
spiciness
and
a
hopladen
finish
better
than
the
great
lakes
pumpkin
ale
in
my
opinion
d
a
truly
easy
drinking
beer
that
iswould
be
a
real
treat
to
drink
on
an
autumn
or
winter
dayand
or
evening
i
have
never
had
pumpkin
before
but
the
spicy
flavours
i
can
detect
in
this
beer
make
it
a
winner
for
me
a
decent
enough
pumpkin
ale
but
i
think
a
tad
overhyped
overall
too
much
clove
and
cinnamon
nearly
no
nuttiness
and
hardly
any
discernible
pumpkin
i
love
love
love
pumpkin
beers
some
are
better
than
others
and
some
are
way
better
than
others
this
one
is
one
of
the
others
i
put
it
in
my
kegerator
last
october
like
i
always
like
to
you
almost
have
to
search
for
the
pumpkin
flavor
other
than
not
being
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
i
will
be
trying
other
pumpkin
beers
in
the
future
though
pours
dark
orange
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
that
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
with
nutmeg
and
allspice
standing
out
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
nutmeg
with
only
a
little
bit
of
pumpkin
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
not
as
good
as
some
pumpkin
ales
but
not
bad
overall
notes
really
good
pumpkin
ale
that
really
does
remind
me
of
autumn
a
lot
like
a
pumpkin
pie
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
it
seems
to
be
lacking
in
the
pumpkin
flavor
department
it
tends
to
feature
the
spices
a
bit
more
but
that
works
for
my
tastes
worth
trying
but
not
a
standout
in
the
crowded
field
of
fall
beers
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
balance
of
autumnal
spices
pumpkin
and
earthy
hops
lots
of
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
as
well
as
some
clove
ginger
and
nutmeg
complimenting
the
sweet
pumpkin
flavor
im
also
picking
up
some
slight
sweet
citrus
notes
mid
palate
that
linger
into
a
dry
finish
for
presentation
i
poured
this
into
a
flying
fish
pint
glass
appearance
is
copperpumpkin
coloured
with
good
head
retention
and
some
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
indicate
a
lot
of
clove
pumpkin
cinnamon
with
a
little
bit
of
bready
malts
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
overall
a
great
value
for
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
typical
with
some
smoothness
and
reasonable
lingering
carbonation
it
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
d
low
abv
wonderful
flavors
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
very
drinkable
brew
drinkability
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
definitely
an
enjoyable
seasonal
without
being
overthetop
d
very
good
properly
spiced
i
can
drink
a
few
with
out
getting
played
out
on
the
flavor
clear
slightly
light
amber
in
color
the
head
on
mine
was
quite
fleeting
the
smell
was
great
just
like
pumpkin
pie
pumpkin
pie
however
is
something
id
rather
smell
than
eat
taste
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
allspice
cinnamon
coriander
in
both
smell
and
taste
also
seems
a
bit
watered
down
i
cant
really
taste
much
beer
here
this
ones
not
for
me
pours
a
clear
orangeamber
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
spice
ginger
all
spice
cinnamon
yeast
and
very
slight
hop
fits
the
style
of
a
pumpkin
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
up
front
spice
better
aroma
than
taste
and
pale
malt
overall
a
great
aroma
but
body
falls
a
little
flat
the
strong
spice
flavor
might
make
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
but
if
this
style
of
beer
pleases
then
give
this
one
a
try
a
spicy
pumpkin
offering
poured
a
light
orange
and
very
clear
doesnt
compare
to
some
other
pumpkin
ales
small
head
and
spotty
lacing
taste
is
spicy
decent
but
again
kind
of
watered
down
compared
to
other
pumpkin
ales
can
do
much
better
when
buying
a
pumpkin
ale
cheers
nice
fairly
easy
drinking
pumpkin
brew
drinkability
i
am
a
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
though
not
when
they
are
too
sweet
this
beer
provides
a
nice
edge
to
the
sweetness
while
i
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
might
pours
clear
deep
amber
with
nice
fluffy
head
aroma
is
strongly
spicy
cinnamon
clove
ginger
flavor
is
sharply
malty
with
a
sharp
long
spice
burn
flavorful
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
clingy
highlighting
the
burn
drinkability
is
not
bad
it
goes
down
easy
and
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
but
all
in
all
i
think
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
available
md
thin
body
is
fine
for
the
style
but
a
little
watery
at
times
easy
to
drink
at
a
reasonable
abv
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
i
still
havent
found
one
but
worth
picking
some
up
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
day
d
especially
drinkable
for
a
pumpkin
ale
the
flavor
is
understated
and
you
can
actually
tell
this
is
an
ale
instead
of
liquid
pumpkin
pie
the
nose
makes
you
think
this
will
be
all
pie
taste
but
thats
not
the
case
d
pumpkin
ales
are
a
rarity
in
a
my
drinking
lineup
but
this
one
shows
up
more
often
than
most
d
really
quite
good
with
manageable
abv
light
feel
but
there
are
simply
better
options
out
there

i
had
high
hopes
from
the
smell
but
the
crispness
masks
the
spices
and
prevents
it
from
standing
out
as
a
pumpkin
ale
a
solid
beer
but
maybe
not
the
best
choice
if
you
want
a
lot
of
pumpkin
in
your
beer
however
if
you
want
to
session
a
pumpkin
ale
this
would
be
a
good
one
mouthfeel
on
this
one
is
all
right
its
drinkable
for
sure
actually
this
is
one
pumpkin
beer
that
would
be
easy
to
drink
for
an
evening
not
too
strong
but
relatively
flavorful
slightly
chalky
fell
but
a
beer
that
has
some
merit
poured
12oz
into
a
southapton
publick
house
glass
color
is
orange
like
a
pumpkin
nice
retaining
head
with
lots
of
lace
smell
is
sweet
with
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
pie
taste
seems
a
little
off
it
has
a
metallic
character
to
it
that
kinda
sucks
as
it
warms
i
get
a
little
more
pumpkin
and
malt
its
pretty
well
balanced
for
the
style
but
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
light
bodied
easy
drinker
if
you
can
stand
more
than
one
d
not
doing
a
whole
lot
for
me
wish
it
was
bigger
color
is
a
rich
amber
pours
with
a
thin
head
which
dissipates
quickly
smell
is
spicy
and
perhaps
a
little
floral
taste
is
sturdy
and
pumpkiney
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
the
pumpkin
and
spices
are
well
balanced
and
integrated
beer
is
pleasantly
bitter
and
not
sweet
or
heavy
as
some
pumpkin
ales
can
be
good
dry
mouthfeel
and
very
good
drinkability
all
in
all
very
good
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
has
a
great
pumpkin
spice
flavor
it
just
needs
some
more
malt
sweetness
and
body
nice
reddishorange
hue
with
moderate
head
smells
of
allspice
nutmeg
and
some
pumpkin
taste
is
not
impressive
horrible
aftertaste
nice
pumpkin
up
front
and
a
little
sweet
but
finishes
with
very
unpleasant
nutmeg
bitterness
moderate
density
mouthfeel
highly
carbonated
not
very
drinkable
dont
know
if
i
will
ever
finish
the
six
pack
sorry
brooklyn
usually
love
your
stuff
but
will
avoid
this
one
at
all
costs
in
the
future

i
bought
this
six
pack
for
my
wife
she
wanted
st
pumpking
and
was
almost
pissed
when
i
couldnt
find
any
this
was
a
reasonable
substitution
i
drank
3
of
them
its
decent
beer
not
too
pumpkiny
or
sweet
a
curious
savoury
ale
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
not
quite
schizophrenic
however
to
me
it
cant
quite
decide
where
it
wants
to
end
up
flavourwise
as
much
as
i
love
my
hops
they
dont
seem
to
be
adding
much
benefit
to
the
overall
experience
very
easy
drinking
and
newuser
friendly
this
is
the
one
that
started
the
whole
pumpkin
craze
and
it
is
a
nice
entry
level
offering
to
the
category
body
is
medium
and
beer
is
nicely
drinkable
not
over
spiced
like
a
lot
of
these
beers
it
is
missing
hop
character
though
i
only
get
spice
that
said
it
is
still
a
well
made
beer
and
if
i
had
to
drink
pumpkin
this
would
be
on
the
short
list
ive
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
so
i
finally
decided
to
try
it
pours
a
copper
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
faded
with
chunky
lacing
the
aroma
is
overwhelmingly
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
like
a
pumpkin
pie
but
also
with
hints
of
caramel
malt
the
taste
alternates
between
the
malts
flavor
and
pumpkin
then
fades
into
some
slightly
harsh
bitterness
and
crispness
from
the
carbonation
but
with
the
pumpkin
taste
always
in
the
background
medium
bodied
with
a
strange
lingering
aftertaste
definitely
not
terrible
as
long
as
you
like
pumpkin
pie
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
2
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
aroma
was
very
good
as
usual
for
most
pumpkin
beers
the
taste
does
not
meet
expectations
still
fairly
solid
overall
very
sessionable
if
possible
mouthfeel
a
little
thin
i
was
hoping
for
some
creaminess
a
middle
of
the
road
pumpkin
ale
really
d
only
5
abv
and
very
light
so
this
one
goes
down
like
an
eager
college
girl
after
a
frat
party
beer
is
okay
but
not
a
really
big
on
this
in
anyway
drinkability
decent
beer
but
an
below
avergae
pumpkin
beer
not
horriebl
just
had
better
d
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
id
definitely
buy
it
again
and
probably
would
bring
it
to
a
halloween
party
as
a
nice
conversation
starterthemed
kinda
thing
as
with
many
pumpkin
beers
good
color
smell
and
mouthfeel
but
the
flavor
is
a
little
too
spicey
a
better
than
average
one
to
have
if
your
dying
for
that
type
of
thing
d
low
abv
and
lighter
body
than
some
other
pumpkinds
make
this
one
pretty
drinkable
if
you
like
or
are
not
bothered
by
the
fake
spice
taste
this
is
your
typical
low
carbonation
spicy
pumpkin
beer
that
is
a
bit
watery
not
that
interesting
has
some
pumpkin
notes
throughout
but
tastes
like
a
rather
bland
pretty
flat
mediocre
amber
ale
with
pumkin
added
and
mostly
spices
in
the
allspice
family
ho
hum
drinkability
i
wanted
to
enjoy
this
ale
i
really
did
but
this
goes
the
way
of
the
summer
ale
in
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
just
a
overzealously
bitter
english
pale
with
a
few
pumpkin
pie
notes
ill
stick
to
punkin
ale
by
dfh
for
my
fall
beer
kick
this
is
a
solid
brew
and
while
theres
not
as
much
pumpkin
as
id
hope
for
its
there
its
a
good
brew
allaround
anyway
12oz
bottle
purchased
at
tullys
in
wells
pours
a
crystalclear
goldenamber
body
with
a
thin
quickly
dissipating
offwhite
head
smells
spicy
sweet
like
a
pumpkin
pie
definitely
cinnamon
and
cloves
tastes
like
cinnamon
clove
allspice
with
a
touch
of
pumpkin
and
caramel
medium
to
light
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
very
tasty
and
quaffable
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
ale
overall
among
the
better
examples
ive
tried
drinkability
this
beer
is
not
bad
in
anyway
but
the
flavor
is
very
unique
i
am
not
sure
how
many
of
these
i
could
really
consume
in
a
session
probably
only
one
or
two
max
hmm
well
what
does
save
it
on
the
drinkability
a
bit
is
the
fact
that
the
hops
or
spice
really
keep
the
beer
from
gettin
to
sweet
and
rather
balanced
on
that
front
i
can
appreciate
that
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
but
pumpkin
ales
are
a
style
that
may
take
me
some
getting
use
to
before
i
could
really
appreciate
them
fully
drinkability
is
average
at
best
i
would
drink
one
if
offered
but
this
is
nothing
i
would
spend
my
money
on
in
the
future
being
that
this
pumpkin
ale
had
very
little
in
the
way
of
a
pumpkin
flavor
im
going
to
have
to
keep
looking
for
one
that
impresses
me
slightly
orange
mostly
gold
in
color
thin
white
head
little
lacing
smell
is
of
mild
spices
not
much
else
taste
is
a
thin
profile
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
with
very
little
pumpkin
almost
a
lager
like
bite
distracts
from
what
little
taste
is
there
slightly
creamy
mild
carbonation
not
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
d
an
alright
beer
it
drinks
fine
but
there
are
much
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
d
this
could
be
a
great
session
pumpkin
ale
but
something
on
the
mouthfeel
is
not
quite
right
still
this
is
much
better
than
harvest
no
pumpkin
in
sight
moon
would
i
buy
more
of
it
yes
without
a
doubt
basically
you
can
think
of
this
beer
as
a
british
style
pale
ale
with
a
blast
of
pumpkin
spice
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
this
is
a
fair
bit
different
than
the
local
pumpkin
ale
versions
that
ive
thus
far
sampled
there
is
very
little
sweetness
so
the
resemblance
to
pumpkin
pie
is
certainly
lessened
that
said
the
overall
dryness
makes
this
a
much
better
candidate
for
a
session
of
waiting
in
that
damp
and
dank
patch
for
the
great
eponymous
one
d
because
of
the
fruity
taste
was
minimal
although
fruity
isnt
generally
an
issue
with
pumpkin
ales
drinkability
is
good
d
good
drinkability
id
have
this
pumpkin
ale
again
for
sure
for
me
pumpkin
beers
arent
sessionable
because
of
all
the
spice
but
i
could
have
two
of
these
yet
another
good
offering
from
brooklyn
d
great
drinkability
allaround
the
only
thing
that
has
my
head
scratching
while
drinking
this
brew
is
the
resemblance
of
saranacs
version
which
we
all
know
brooklyn
brewery
is
outsourcing
this
beer
to
other
than
that
fact
one
good
pumpkin
ale
that
makes
me
feel
warm
inside
on
cold
fall
nights
its
all
an
illusion
either
way
notes
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
with
just
enough
balance
for
my
taste
interesting
enough
that
i
might
buy
another
sixer
before
the
winter
hits
d
reasonably
drinkable
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
the
spices
are
a
bit
cloying
not
bad
but
i
am
in
no
hurry
to
have
another
dthis
is
one
heck
of
a
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
sure
weyerbacher
imperial
is
a
better
example
but
you
can
drink
this
all
night
at
5

avb
ill
call
this
the
seasonal
sessioner
for
the
fall
this
was
my
first
full
pumpkin
beer
taste
was
very
sweet
up
front
especially
the
first
few
sips
after
it
set
into
my
palate
though
there
was
a
good
amount
of
balance
its
obviously
going
to
be
on
the
malty
side
of
things
but
this
one
had
some
decent
bitter
backbone
that
allowed
the
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
others
spices
to
pronounce
themselves
mouthfeel
was
a
little
under
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
as
well
im
not
sure
id
knock
back
a
ton
of
these
in
a
night
but
i
could
definitely
do
an
evening
sample
of
the
pumpkin
ale
style
and
if
i
did
that
id
make
sure
post
road
pumpkin
was
on
my
list
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
the
marking
best
before
feb
2010
sampled
on
september
26
2009
the
pour
is
an
rich
orangecopper
with
excitable
carbonation
and
about
an
inch
of
puffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
mild
but
full
of
pumpkin
spice
nutmeg
and
fresh
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
average
pumpkin
spices
and
hops
in
the
taste
with
a
little
graininess
and
a
lingering
but
pleasing
hopped
aftertaste
a
nice
fall
seasonal
and
easy
to
drink
d
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
to
date
this
would
be
perfect
to
pair
with
an
oktoberfest
beer
for
the
contrast
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
are
concerned
this
is
an
a
drinkability
one
of
the
more
drinkable
pumpkin
ales
simply
because
nothing
really
stands
out
hints
of
pumpkin
hints
of
spice
a
subtle
sweetness
all
around
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
but
i
wouldnt
be
in
any
kind
of
hurry
overall
cant
say
i
would
drink
it
again
because
it
is
way
to
overpowering
on
the
spices
but
i
think
everyone
should
try
it
in
retrospect
of
other
pumpkin
beers
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
the
spicing
is
nice
with
other
pumpkin
ales
out
there
like
pumking
and
punkin
ale
i
probably
wont
waste
my
time
with
this
one
again
but
check
it
out
if
the
overwhelming
flavor
of
pumking
is
too
much
for
you
but
you
still
like
a
good
pumpkin
ale
drinkability
dangerously
drinkable
especially
for
the
style
i
like
how
this
has
a
marzen
taste
to
it
the
spicing
seems
just
right
and
i
could
have
two
or
three
brooklyn
seems
to
do
seasonal
autumn
beers
quite
well
drinkability
is
ok
but
not
something
id
want
often
just
too
spiced
up
for
for
extended
drinking
drinkability
plain
and
simple
if
you
dont
like
pumpkin
or
spiced
beers
stay
away
from
this
one
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
appearance
is
just
what
you
would
expect
from
a
pumpkin
ale
amber
orange
nice
little
offwhite
head
that
should
have
hung
around
a
bit
longer
than
it
did
smells
like
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
wheres
the
whipped
cream
my
first
impression
of
taste
was
this
is
hoppier
than
most
pumpkin
ales
that
seem
to
emphasize
malt
a
nice
counterbalance
to
the
sweetness
of
malt
i
think
what
some
reviewers
have
referred
to
as
a
spice
bite
is
actually
the
hops
breaking
through
this
is
a
dry
pumpkin
ale
which
is
nice
and
in
my
opinion
unique
could
drink
a
few
without
a
problem
and
will
do
so
i
am
sure
glad
i
got
a
case
and
am
looking
forward
to
fall
evenings
with
a
glass
of
this
in
my
hand
cheers
d
a
great
offering
from
brooklyn
that
is
very
very
drinkable
enjoyable
and
a
find
worth
searching
for
d
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
and
quite
drinkable
not
as
good
as
dfh
punkin
or
weyerbacher
but
still
a
solid
fall
seasonal
t
it
has
a
very
pumpkiny
taste
as
you
would
expect
and
some
nice
peppery
spiciness
to
it
has
a
kind
of
citrusy
aftertaste
its
certainly
got

pumpkin
ale
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
tasty
holiday
brewone
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
pumpkin
ale
style
if
you
like
the
subtle
sweet
and
earthy
taste
of
pumpkin
you
wont
like
this
beer
very
nice
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
because
of
the
very
good
balance
not
too
spicy
but
spice
is
the
dominant
character
id
buy
it
again
the
mouthfeel
is
overcarbonated
and
prickly
kind
of
like
seltzer
water
i
would
only
want
one
of
these
at
most
overall
there
is
some
pumpkin
flavor
but
it
is
lost
by
overcarbonation
and
a
strong
citrussour
presence
not
an
overly
enjoyable
brew
there
are
much
better
out
there
from
my
tasting
tonight
i
would
recommend
both
the
wolavers
and
dfh
over
this
mouthfeel
would
be
good
except
for
the
tastebudslaying
carbonation
mediumbodied
with
a
watery
finish
can
do
better
for
drinkability
overall
ive
had
better
pumpkin
ales
but
can
appreciate
this
as
some
nostalgic
version
of
18th
century
seasonal
brewing
not
a
mindblowing
beer
but
a
great
all
around
brew
good
for
those
early
fall
days
poured
a
dark
ambernice
frothy
head
that
lasted
a
minute
or
so
nose
barely
of
ale
light
mouthfeel
hardly
a
hint
of
pumpkin
or
spices
had
an
ale
aftertaste
was
disappointed
that
i
couldnt
detect
any
flavours
of
pumpkin
or
spices
as
expected
just
a
light
beer
without
spicepumpkin
character
this
was
one
of
the
surprises
of
the
night
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
that
i
feel
is
out
there
in
fact
one
of
the
only
2
or
3
i
evern
look
forward
to
each
year
along
with
dfh
punk
and
weyerbacher
this
is
nice
because
it
doesnt
just
taste
like
some
generic
ale
or
lager
with
pumpkin
flavor
added
nor
is
it
a
quitespicy
mix
of
cinnamon
and
other
spices
the
way
the
aforementioned
beers
are
the
pour
is
a
nice
lightauburn
aroma
is
sort
of
a
light
pumpkin
essence
with
spicy
autumnal
presence
flavor
is
very
smooth
and
has
a
very
nice
fall
character
to
it
mouth
is
fullbodied
but
light
not
like
a
light
beer
though
overall
its
very
smooth
and
very
nice
drinkability
high
this
is
a
beautifully
crafted
seasonal
that
wont
overpower
anyone
whos
interested
in
trying
additional
flavors
in
their
beer
brooklyn
brewery
really
excels
by
using
only
topquality
ingredients
and
caring
about
the
outcome
not
just
profits
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
not
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
normally
drink
but
its
ok
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
light
to
medium
body
good
amount
of
carb
very
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
this
is
usually
my
go
to
beer
when
i
go
to
a
party
or
somethin
in
the
fall
time
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
more
than
a
finger
of
barely
offwhite
head
nose
is
full
of
festive
fall
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
dominating
with
a
bit
of
citrus
that
may
be
coriander
but
it
also
has
something
applelike
in
the
smell
as
well
taste
is
right
in
line
with
what
it
smells
like
i
can
only
guess
that
the
number
of
spices
that
cling
in
the
aftertaste
are
partially
responsible
for
the
dry
finish
carbination
is
quite
high
and
the
mouthfeel
is
heavier
than
i
expected
i
was
thirsty
for
this
style
of
beer
and
it
accomplished
what
i
wanted
however
i
dont
forsee
myself
enjoying
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
drinkability
this
is
probably
the
second
best
pumpkin
ale
that
ive
sampled
thus
far
dfh
still
in
the
lead
i
really
do
enjoy
this
one
though
and
appreciate
the
flavors
as
its
very
fitting
for
the
impending
season
the
abv
isnt
too
high
and
this
is
a
great
after
dinner
kind
of
beer
cheers
final
thoughts
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
that
stretches
the
boundaries
of
spices
typically
its
way
to
spicey
but
these
spices
are
lighter
and
full
of
really
tasty
rye
i
think
ill
have
to
find
a
good
pumpkin
spread
and
slap
it
on
top
of
rye
bread
to
match
this
beer
not
overbearing
on
the
pumpkin
flavor
either
i
think
i
can
actually
dig
this
beer
perhaps
ive
found
a
second
pumpkin
beer
i
can
enjoy
i
dont
consider
cape
ann
pumpkin
stout
a
pumpkin
beer
since
its
a
stout
and
its
not
spiced
and
tastes
great
the
mouth
is
moderately
crisp
but
there
is
a
slippery
quality
to
it
that
isnt
the
greatest
the
flavor
is
pretty
average
i
expected
more
from
this
due
to
the
smell
but
im
getting
just
hints
of
spice
starts
off
sweet
like
a
cream
soda
but
finishes
bready
and
a
little
dull
this
is
pretty
decent
but
not
the
greatest
of
the
style
im
still
on
my
search
drinkability
a
particularly
wellbalanced
pumpkin
ale
refreshing
and
not
overpowering
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
thick
white
head
that
sticks
around
leaving
solid
lacing
a
great
look
to
this
beer
the
aroma
is
quite
malty
and
bready
with
some
spice
character
not
a
ton
of
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
which
is
unfortunate
the
flavor
matches
well
with
some
cinnamon
all
spice
and
nutmeg
the
maltiness
comes
through
well
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
creamy
with
light
carbonation
a
nice
drinking
pumpkin
that
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
on
a
cool
autumn
afternoon
watching
the
leaves
fall
pairs
with
bluegrass
on
pandora
a
very
drinkable
watered
down
version
of
what
i
believe
a
pumpkin
beer
should
appearance
is
very
clear
golden
with
some
ruby
redness
small
head
and
spotty
lacing
taste
is
decent
but
again
kind
of
watered
down
compared
to
other
pumpkin
ales
maybe
a
good
pumkin
ale
to
introduce
a
noncraft
drinker
too
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
to
have
on
a
nice
autumnfelt
night
here
in
pa
a
bit
sweet
to
drink
all
night
but
ive
had
4
or
5
in
a
sitting
before
so
does
that
qualify
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
but
im
glad
i
didnt
get
the
whole
6er
and
only
bought
three
its
not
overly
spiced
and
well
balanced
between
the
malt
and
pumpkin
flavor
i
could
certainly
see
myself
drinking
this
on
a
cool
crisp
autumn
night
while
watching
football
d
really
drinkable
brew
this
is
not
overdone
at
all
which
was
one
of
my
chief
concerns
going
into
this
brew
this
offering
is
very
caseworthy
and
is
a
sure
crowd
pleaser
a
very
drinkable
seasonal
brew
this
type
of
brew
was
never
my
favorite
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
solid
brew
very
good
on
the
right
occasion
i
would
never
hesitate
to
give
this
one
another
try
im
sure
this
would
be
interesting
with
some
foods
as
well
honestly
im
still
getting
into
the
pumpkin
genre
alltogetherbut
this
seemed
to
have
hit
the
spot
although
id
like
to
try
something
slightly
more
poignant
next
time
in
regard
to
the
pumpkin
theme
this
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
color
a
one
finger
of
white
head
caps
the
beer
off
head
recedes
to
a
film
that
is
retained
throughout
nice
sheets
of
lacing
coat
the
glass
nose
is
faintly
of
pumpkin
heavy
on
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
a
touch
of
ginger
taste
is
of
pumpkin
up
front
folowed
my
dominant
spicing
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
end
has
some
malt
touch
to
it
but
an
odd
medicinal
taste
light
to
medium
body
medium
to
high
carbonation
activity
of
the
carbonation
is
quite
visible
gives
almost
a
seltzer
feel
to
it
slight
oily
feel
on
the
tongue
this
beer
gets
a
bit
better
as
you
continue
drinking
but
there
are
better
of
the
style
out
there
just
picked
up
a
single
bottle
of
this
pumpkin
brew
fresh
for
fall
09
amberorangish
color
with
very
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
great
but
to
be
honest
i
havent
come
across
a
pumpkin
ale
that
doesnt
smell
good
the
taste
is
average
and
a
little
watered
down
in
my
opinion
nice
fall
session
brew
but
if
youre
seeking
a
real
pumpkin
ale
this
isnt
it
very
drinkable
beer
even
if
it
isnt
as
strong
a
pumpkin
ale
as
i
was
expecting
pours
a
golden
at
the
bottom
copper
at
the
top
color
with
a
big
thick
fluffy
head
no
real
lacing
to
be
seen
the
smell
is
of
pumpkin
but
it
is
pretty
weak
for
an
aroma
there
are
also
hints
of
spice
the
taste
is
of
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
a
good
taste
very
pumpkin
in
taste
however
it
is
slightly
watery
the
mouthfeel
was
harsh
the
first
few
sips
but
gave
way
to
a
very
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
high
you
can
have
many
of
these
back
to
back
overall
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
cheers
a
12
ounce
brown
bottle
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
burnt
copper
color
with
about
a
finger
of
off
white
foam
smells
and
tastes
primarily
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
such
as
nutmeg
allspice
cinnamon
clove
as
well
as
sweet
toasted
grains
and
malt
this
pumpkin
ale
is
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
dark
pumpkin
orange
with
tons
of
fine
suspended
yeast
visable
and
a
fine
cream
colored
head
that
leaves
nice
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
allspice
cinnamon
and
cloves
and
pumpkin
with
some
biscuit
malt
tastes
better
than
most
of
this
style
because
it
retains
beer
flavor
to
go
along
with
the
liquified
pumpkin
pie
flavor
roasted
pumpkin
and
clove
matched
with
mild
finishing
hops
and
biscuity
malt
medium
light
bodied
and
effervescent
not
bad
drinking
if
you
like
pumpkin
brew
not
bad
could
use
some
more
flavor
to
be
fair
it
came
out
last
fall
but
was
stored
at
33
degrees
since
february
a
nice
change
of
pace
though
even
being
79
months
old
this
stuff
was
really
good
it
didnt
taste
unfresh
id
love
to
have
it
fresh
the
problem
i
find
with
pumpkin
ales
is
that
after
a
while
they
begin
to
taste
too
much
like
nutmeg
this
one
does
to
an
extent
but
not
as
much
as
others
ive
had
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
though
a
good
effort
from
brooklyn
brewery
paired
well
with
marinated
chicken
d
i
dont
know
i
just
cant
get
into
this
beer
if
ya
like
beers
that
brings
some
holiday
flair
give
it
go
if
not
look
elsewhere
i
taste
alot
of
lageresque
sulfur
flavors
allspice
prickliness
and
hop
and
toast
bitterness
this
one
is
very
low
on
actual
pumpkin
flavor
it
is
not
bad
but
i
expect
more
from
the
brooklyn
brewery
easy
to
drink
and
overall
my
favorite
that
i
tried
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
with
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
nice
smooth
malts
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
and
with
mild
spice
low
viscosity
and
minimal
alcohol
5
this
is
the
besttasting
and
most
sessionable
pumpkin
going
get
some
orange
pour
with
a
puffy
white
head
and
some
excellent
lacing
which
is
exactly
the
appearance
i
would
expect
in
this
style
light
spice
aroma
and
a
touch
of
pale
malt
with
lots
of
pumpkin
the
taste
is
not
as
spicy
as
i
would
expect
but
i
do
detect
a
fair
bit
of
nutmeg
and
a
dose
of
cinnamon
which
helps
provide
this
with
a
slightly
bitter
background
the
pumpkin
is
nicely
pronounce
alongside
brown
sugar
medium
body
and
carbonation
leading
through
to
a
dry
finish
as
stated
if
you
like
pumpkin
pie
then
you
should
like
pumpkin
ales
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
then
you
should
like
brooklyns
post
road
pumpkin
ale
although
its
not
likely
to
take
up
all
the
room
in
your
fridge
it
should
surely
at
least
take
up
some
room
at
your
dinner
table
especially
around
thanksgiving
time
d
good
warm
toasty
pumpkin
beer
with
just
a
little
bit
of
spice
in
the
nose
and
good
fresh
pumpkin
taste
not
too
pumpkiny
to
get
annoying
drinkability
so
very
drinkable
probably
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
in
terms
of
drinkability
i
could
easily
do
a
sixpack

drinkability
good
for
this
too
relatively
low

spices
and
balance
of
flavors
are
enough
to
keep
you
going
and
is
good
for

chilly

weyerbachers
imperial
pumpkin
ale
is
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
but
this
one
is
still
solid
light
bodied
spice
isnt
overpowering
and
this
ones
pretty
drinkable
this
is
quite
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
though
a
little
overspiced
for
my
tastes
d
not
the
best
but
not
bad
either
worth
having
d
in
the
end
this
is
the
most
palatable
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
but
not
somthing
im
likely
to
buy
again
this
is
more
of
a
hoppy
clove
beer
than
anything
else
it
take
a
little
bit
to
get
a
balance
with
this
beer
the
pumpkin
spice
nose
and
intial
taste
are
back
up
with
a
fairly
hoppy
ale
that
comes
in
after
a
few
sips
once
an
equilibrium
is
maintained
the
beer
drinks
well
with
a
xmas
beer
type
profilespicy
ale
d
post
road
pumpkin
ale
is
a
solid
pumpkin
that
is
worth
a
shot
overall
it
is
ok
which
is
my
general
outlook
on
most
brooklyn
brewery
beers
the
tide
is
beginning
to
rise
on
this
style
it
may
not
be
the
best
but
its
keeping
up
with
other
offerings
for
now
mfd
a
very
good
example
of
this
style
worth
checking
out
pours
a
clear
ruddy
orange
light
copper
colour
medium
sized
off
white
head
forms
settles
down
to
a
thin
later
then
a
thing
ring
around
the
glass
very
few
lace
spots
smell
is
nice
pumpkin
nutmeg
cinnamon
some
clove
caramel
bread
brown
sugar
quite
spicy
but
not
overdone
taste
is
not
so
hot
very
watery
metallic
spices
and
malt
are
almost
nonexistent
light
bit
of
floral
hoppiness
near
the
finish
but
otherwise
watery
and
not
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
kind
of
rough
on
the
palate
bit
medicinal
in
the
finish
not
so
good
aroma
is
nice
but
nothing
else
really
goes
right
with
this
one
overallsubdued
pumpkin
taste
for
this
sort
of
beer
but
with
the
sweetness
and
spiciness
up
front
i
really
enjoyed
it
good
beer
drinkability
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
ever
had
but
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
pumpkin
md
not
bad
for
a
pumpkin
beer
but
not
my
favorite
by
far
i
either
love
or
hate
pumpkin
beers
and
this
is
on
the
better
side
of
the
style
it
has
an
interesting
dryness
to
it
that
i
wasnt
expecting
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
its
very
even
and
doesnt
give
your
palate
too
much
of
a
workout
with
the
spicing
this
has
grown
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
this
time
of
year
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
to
see
what
a
slightly
different
type
of
carbonation
would
do
to
this
a
good
beer
overall
the
recipe
seems
solid
but
the
textures
are
off
a
little
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
but
fairly
drinkable
d
as
with
any
pumpkin
beer
i
appreciate
the
style
and
like
to
drink
a
few
in
the
fall
but
can
only
drink
so
much
in
a
given
session
d
first
real
pumpkin
ale
so
nothing
to
really
compare
to
but
this
seems
like
a
well
balanced
beer
not
a
ton
of
pumpkin
to
overwhelm
a
little
bit
lighter
then
i
expected
though
not
bad
d
standard
pumpkin
ale
slightly
dryer
than
most
solid
but
not
respectable
d
a
decent
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
the
spices
were
a
bit
strong
in
the
taste
and
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
the
pumpkin
taste
to
balance
out
the
heavy
ginger
ok
drinkability
overall
im
glad
i
waited
until
my
second
try
of
this
beer
to
review
it
becuase
it
seems
like
an
entirely
different
beer
perhaps
i
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
more
and
poured
it
more
vigorously
because
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
now
but
i
honestly
couldnt
finish
my
first
glass
of
it
it
may
be
that
first
bottle
was
a
bit
off
it
wont
be
my
first
choice
for
a
pumpkin
beer
in
the
future
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
heck
it
may
even
grow
on
me
more
d
an
easy
drinker
but
not
overly
enticing
worth
trying
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
lots
of
orange
hues
and
a
one
finger
white
head
made
up
of
little
bubbles
nutmeg
pepper
and
sweet
pumpkin
aromas
flavors
of
nutmeg
allspice
toasted
and
carmelized
malt
pumpkin
lemony
hops
maybe
some
wheat
medium
body
medium
carbonation
this
one
is
a
little
watery
in
the
mouth
good
drinkability
there
is
more
of
a
hop
profile
than
in
other
pumpkin
beers
ive
sampled
color
is
a
clear
orangy
amber
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
and
has
hints
of
pumpkin
and
cloves
scrumptuous
flavor
is
malty
and
spicy
and
has
a
real
pumpkin
undertone
apparently
this
beer
is
made
with
actual
pumpkin
so
they
arent
faking
it
texture
is
lively
and
satisfying
and
finish
is
smooth
and
tasty
orange
amber
hue
with
small
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
a
very
amiable
aroma
of
spices
pumpkin
pie
cinnamon
and
ginger
make
the
mouth
water
you
wont
be
disappointed
either
pleasant
with
its
light
body
and
balanced
taste
of
spice
and
pumpkin
flavors
perfect
for
the
transition
into
the
winter
season
a
tasty
satisfying
ale
that
effortlessly
hits
your
sweettooth
and
warms
the
soul
overall
alot
of
spice
flavors
maybe
a
little
too
much
but
im
not
complaining
great
flavor
in
my
opinion
hope
to
get
more
of
this
next
year
drinkability
i
can
session
a
sixer
of
this
yet
i
feel
like
the
spices
may
turn
some
off
after
2
or
3
although
this
is
one
of
the
closest
pumkin
resemblences
ive
had
it
might
taste
too
much
like
pumpkin
the
spices
are
there
and
definetley
kickin
its
just
treating
the
right
palate
with
this
kind
of
beer
where
somebody
wont
be
offended
by
its
character
in
my
book
though
an
excellent
pumkin
that
will
only
get
better
with
age
bottle
poured
a
medium
amber
color
ale
with
a
good
size
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
light
pumpkin
notes
with
some
light
cinnamon
notes
also
distinguishable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
light
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
taste
wow
i
was
quite
surprise
by
how
bland
and
average
this
offering
is
i
was
expecting
something
with
a
lot
more
character
d
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
my
only
complaint
is
the
mouthfeel
its
definitely
balanced
nicely
and
very
drinkable
there
was
not
tons
of
pumpkin
flavor
but
their
were
hints
of
it
i
tasted
a
metallic
flavor
almost
as
much
as
the
pumpkin
flavor
it
is
the
time
of
year
for
a
pumpkin
beer
but
if
you
look
hard
you
will
be
able
to
do
better
than
this
beer
for
a
pumpkin
ale
brooklyn
is
a
great
brewery
though
and
they
are
100
renewable
energy
i
tried
this
right
after
the
st
ambroise
citrouille
and
felt
this
did
better
only
with
respect
to
appearance
the
head
was
momentary
and
i
thought
it
looked
more
white
than
anything
else
it
turned
wispy
and
did
stick
around
though
with
a
bit
of
lacing
here
and
there
clear
light
brown
orange
hilights
distinct
smell
i
thought
of
a
ginger
ale
with
feint
whiffs
of
orange
or
other
fruit
zest
taste
bitter
with
marmalade
predominant
and
flashes
of
sour
fruit
thin
body
mouthfeel
initially
spritzy
but
settled
into
a
spice
and
malt
finish
i
have
a
few
favourites
from
this
brewery
but
this
is
not
near
the
top
of
the
list
decent
but
not
remarkable
poored
a
light
copper
color
with
decent
cream
head
that
struggled
to
hold
on
but
left
some
lacing
smelled
of
light
pumpkin
spice
and
a
hint
of
banana
taste
is
that
of
a
weak
pumpkin
pie
with
somewhat
of
a
bad
acid
taste
as
well
originally
purchased
for
a
campfire
night
doesnt
really
have
the
qualities
of
something
id
have
a
few
of
and
unwind
with
would
most
likely
try
another
pumpkin
ale
if
the
option
was
there
just
way
too
understated
to
stack
up
as
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
especially
when
compared
to
some
of
the
other
similar
seasonal
offerings
out
there
right
now
loved
brooklyn
lager
but
this
is
a
clear
miss
a
good
and
different
example
of
this
fall
style
dyou
can
easily
drink
a
sixer
of
this
brew
without
it
getting
old
or
annoying
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
during
the
fall
months
d
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
if
you
enjoy
pumpkin
pie
d
this
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
would
make
for
a
good
session
beer
d
a
nice
fall
beer
id
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
pours
an
ambercopper
color
head
is
a
single
finger
and
fizzy
extreme
metallic
taste
over
fermented
or
carbonation
stimulated
smell
is
heavily
scented
with
spices
and
of
course
pumpkin
taste
is
medium
bodied
typical
ale
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
almost
watery
and
again
metallic
drinkability
is
low
i
think
this
beer
is
a
miss
could
be
that
i
got
a
bad
batch
could
be
that
its
just
plain
overrated
go
with
dogfish
head
pumkin
instead
poured
a
dark
orange
into
my
goblet
with
a
frothy
head
which
quickly
reduced
into
a
thin
cap
and
left
minute
lacing
aroma
is
spices
and
pumpkin
quite
tasty
i
can
smell
it
from
here
while
my
glass
is
next
to
me
as
i
type
good
malt
aroma
pumpkin
clove
a
little
cinnamon
mouthfeel
is
loose
with
minimal
carbonation
and
a
lightmedium
body
i
expected
more
depth
taste
is
mainly
of
pumkin
spices
clove
cinnamon
as
well
as
pumpkin
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
toasted
almonds
overall
this
beer
is
quite
good
im
glad
i
bought
a
sixer
and
could
see
myself
getting
another
d
this
is
a
fiar
drinking
pumpkin
beer
i
really
rate
it
down
slightly
only
because
it
is
just
a
little
too
similar
to
a
standard
pale
ale
and
i
think
of
drinkability
as
in
part
within
style
this
is
an
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
beer
though
d
considering
this
was
my
first
pumpkin
ale
i
dont
really
have
anything
to
base
my
critique
on
however
i
was
happy
to
find
that
they
didnt
go
overboard
with
the
pumpkin
flavour
all
in
all
this
is
an
interesting
brew
that
fits
the
season
quite
well
im
going
to
save
the
rest
of
my
6pack
for
thanksgiving
this
coming
weekend
canadian
thanksgiving
that
is
decent
carbonation
nice
flavour
make
this
fairly
drinkable
after
a
moderately
quick
pour
this
beer
is
a
bright
clear
dark
copperorange
with
a
fairly
thick
and
lacy
head
the
smell
is
of
some
spice
definite
cinnamon
with
nutmeg
and
allspice
typical
pie
spicing
there
is
actually
some
grain
in
the
background
the
taste
is
pretty
nice
overall
the
spices
do
come
out
front
but
they
arent
cloying
and
the
beer
itself
isnt
overly
sweet
two
big
pluses
this
is
still
a
beer
not
an
over
spiced
attempt
at
liquid
pie
a
bit
of
malt
is
detectable
as
well
as
some
spicy
hoppiness
that
brings
everything
together
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
the
spiciness
does
tend
to
linger
and
get
a
little
annoying
after
a
while
but
thats
true
of
most
beers
with
spice
and
as
far
is
drinkability
is
concerned
this
is
a
pumpkin
beer
which
by
definition
is
a
style
where
you
drink
one
and
then
youre
done
or
move
onto
something
else
one
goes
done
well
enough
actually
much
easier
than
many
other
examples
of
the
style
but
its
not
a
session
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
a
better
than
average
representative
of
the
style
good
flavours
over
all
and
enjoyable
save
for
the
headache
d
it
wasnt
too
overpowering
to
have
more
than
one
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
fall
beer
pretty
drinkable
for
a
pumpkin
ale
a
little
less
sweet
than
most
overall
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
pumpkin
beer
theres
nothing
spectacularly
bad
about
it
but
theres
nothing
that
makes
me
want
to
drink
it
again
either
i
will
definitely
drink
the
rest
of
these
this
is
a
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
this
ranks
right
up
there
with
dogfish
head
and
smuttynose
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
just
the
right
amount
of
pumpkin
spice
in
there
and
its
all
blended
together
beautifully
great
job
here
by
brooklyn
brewery
buying
this
company
they
make
a
kick
ass
pumpkin
ale
picked
up
a
six
pack
for
last
weekend
poured
into
pint
glasses
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
very
watery
looking
orange
color
with
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
nose
my
wife
looked
at
me
and
asked
if
mine
tasted
ok
very
weak
flavor
and
almost
tasted
it
bit
soapy
when
it
first
hits
your
mouth
glasses
were
clean
dont
worry
there
was
some
pumpkin
flavor
there
but
not
a
lot
very
thin
beer
definitely
not
my
favorite
offering
from
brooklyn
there
are
much
better
pumpkins
out
there
cough
cough
smutty
we
left
the
rest
in
the
fridge
and
moved
on
to
some
victory
festbiers
d
good
beer
but
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
served
in
a
standard
pint
poured
a
translucent
copper
with
a
frothy
bright
white
head
sticky
strands
of
lacing
coated
the
sides
of
the
glass
during
the
session
nose
was
almost
nonexistent
perhaps
some
nutmeg
and
pale
malt
but
really
difficult
to
detect
taste
follows
nose
slightly
more
pronounced
in
the
mouth
but
very
subdued
for
the
style
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
is
present
but
barely
detectable
light
and
lively
mouthfeel
with
some
carbonation
tingle
across
the
tongue
decent
drinkability
but
for
all
the
wrong
reasons
very
muted
flavor
profile
which
keeps
it
easy
drinking
but
not
what
one
anticipates
for
the
style
of
beer
serving
type
bottle
d
definitely
drinkable
just
disappointed
theres
no
pumpkin
taste
a
nice
beer
to
celebrate
the
first
day
of
autumn
overall
a
very
average
pumpkin
ale
which
smells
nice
but
tastes
rather
lackluster
my
only
caveat
for
this
one
was
that
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
my
palate
had
had
enough
of
the
sweetness
and
i
wanted
another
beer
but
not
another
one
of
these
d
its
ok
but
not
knocking
my
socks
off
pumpkins
are
more
in
the
nose
than
the
flavour
glad
i
tried
it
but
would
not
want
another
one
12
oz

very
bland

dry
and
kinda
clovey
moderate
carbonation
moderate

light

no

overall
after
the
aroma
this
beer
is
not
very
good
but
it
does
smell
awesome
poured
an

with
a
white

pumpkin
not
too
strong
with
some
spices
taste
is
not
strong
of
pumpkin
or
spices
almost
watered
down
to
me
left
a
weird
aftertatse
this
is
still
a
beer
i
would
drink
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
d
i
dont
know
if
its
just
pumpkin
ales
or
me
or
a
little
bit
of
both
but
a
few
sips
of
this
is
all
i
really
need
i
dont
enjoy
these
pumpkinpumpkin
pie
spice
flavors
without
some
appropriate
sweetness
and
this
brew
is
no
exception
not
bad
at
all
but
nothing
id
want
a
few
of
pours
clear
amber
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
head
stays
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the

and
leaves
behind
plenty
of
sticky
lace
smells
of
big
spice
and
slight
cidery
smell
lots
of
nutmeg
in
there
big
pumpkin
pie
flavor
slight
toasted
malt
finishes
with
a
little
harsh
bitterness
just
a
little
it
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
good
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
far
better
then
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i
love
pumpkin
beers
and
this
one
is
decent
i
would
probably
reach
for
others
first
but
with
limited
selection
i
wouldnt
think
twice
about
getting
this
one
again
pours
a
light
brownish
orange
in
color
decent
inch
of
head
on
the
pour
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
smell
is
spice
and
a
good
amount
of
pumpkin
taste
is
even
more
of
the
pumpkin
flavoring
medium
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
decent
amount
of
pumpkin
flavoring
but
could
use
a
bit
more
spice
poured
out
a
dark
copper
with
a
oneinch
head
despite
a
pretty
heavy
pour
smelled
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
almost
immediately
very
prevalent
you
also
get
hints
of
other
herbs
and
earthy
tones
tastes
very
earthy
you
can
taste
that
cinnamon
nutmeg
effect
brooklyn
was
going
for
but
no
real
presence
of
a
sweet
pumpkin
flavor
that
i
was
looking
for
this
could
almost
be
a
brown
ale
if
it
werent
for
the
mildly
sweet
cinnamon
and
malt
flavors
overall
a
good
pumpkin
ale
the
right
idea
but
not
exactly
inyourface
with
pumpkin
flavor
d
nice
beer
for
a
fall
evening
or
a
sunday
football
game
i
am
biased
because
i
really
enjoy
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
acceptable
the
quality
carbonation
suggested
by
the
head
and
lacing
is
a
plus
d
i
wanted
more
i
thought
it
was
light
and
easy
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
i
loved
the
flavor
that
it
did
have
d
overall
one
of
the
more
drinkable
pumpkin
ales
out
there
if
you
have
not
tried
a
pumpkin
beer
you
should
begin
here
just
know
youre
beginning
with
the
best
a
perfectly
clear
light
orange
with
red
tint
head
builds
up
really
nice
though
fades
pretty
fast
the
smell
is
all
those
spices
as
advertised
get
a
lot
of
clove
out
of
it
the
beer
is
pretty
sweet
upon
sipping
but
finishes
with
a
dry
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
light
and
well
carbonated
overall
it
didnt
seem
to
have
a
savory
or
bready
quality
i
was
hoping
for
seemed
more
like
a
lot
of
spices
on
a
real
thin
backbone
im
not
running
to
the
fridge
for
another
bottle
the
drink
is
smooth
and
palatable
with
nice
drinkability
pleasantly
spicy
and
earthy
but
not
very
punkinny
overall
ive
definitely
had
better
dfhsouthern
tierweyerbacher
not
too
good
here
solid
pumpkin
ale
this
was
my
first
attempt
at
a
pumpkin
ale
and
while
its
not
outstanding
i
certainly
found
it
to
be
intriguing
it
seems
like
the
type
of
beer
that
would
be
best
suited
for
a
crisp
autumn
evening
im
looking
forward
to
trying
some
other
examples
from
this
style
in
the
coming
months
this
is
my
first
year
getting
into
oktoberfests
and
pumkin
ales
ive
gotten
around
to
quite
a
few
already
but
this
one
is
different
from
the
rest
the
spices
are
amazing
there
is
a
lot
going
on
not
to
bitter
to
burn
the
tongue
just
right
followed
by
a
smooth
aftertaste
the
finish
is
great
very
crisp
and
taste
of
pumpkin
spices
stayed
on
my
tongue
i
would
of
have
one
or
two
more
try
it
tons
of
tan
head
on
this
brew
after
i
pour
it
into
my
glass
great
retention
too
and
decent
lacing
orangeamber
color
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
and
hints
of
spice
flavors
however
are
weak
nutmeg
subtle
pumpkin
in
the
middle
with
an
unusual
finish
semidry
and
a
little
bitter
but
not
in
a
balanced
way
light
in
the
mouth
a
little
watery
needs
gumption
a
good
theory
but
a
rather
poor
execution
i
found
this
beer
to
be
better
than
average
while
it
did
have
a
nice
deep
color
i
thought
it
had
a
little
too
much
cinnamonnutmeg
flavor
somewhat
over
powering
still
better
than
many
of
the
other
pumpkin
flavored
beers
on
the
market
you
could
probably
drink
a
couple
but
thats
it
used
to
live
in
a
town
along
the
post
road
in
ct
loved
the
place
wonderful
time
of
year
for
us
pumpkin
lovers
i
you
like
the
style
youll
love
this
version
deep
brown
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
head
and
a
soft
carbonation
spice
nutmeg
clove
cinnamon
in
the
nose
taste
is
malt
and
spice
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
and
a
nice
hops
balance
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
makes
it
very
drinkable
i
noted
on
the
label
that
the
beer
is
brewed
in
utica
a
la
mattsaranac
and
others
great
beer
town
serving
type
bottle
the
temperature
is
dropping
and
the
fall
seasonals
have
been
popping
up
pumpkin
ales
are
meant
to
be
enjoyed
this
time
of
year
and
this
is
a
rather
good
offering
nice
full
pumpkin
aroma
with
spicy
hints
of
clove
and
cinnamon
golden
dark
copper
color
with
a
huge
creamy
head
that
ultimately
settles
and
leaves
some
decent
lacing
mouthfeel
is
good
and
crisp
wish
it
were
a
bit
thicker
and
creamier
though
flavor
has
a
nice
balance
the
pumpkin
is
easily
detected
but
not
overdone
good
spiciness
of
clove
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
aftertaste
lingers
for
a
while
giving
a
nice
sweet
finish
out
of
the
ordinary
and
well
done
im
sure
there
are
better
out
there
but
this
one
still
hits
the
mark
gc
d
decent
drinkability
for
what
it
is
note
i
am
trying
not
to
be
harsh
to
this
beer
because
im
1
not
familiar
with
the
style
and
dont
know
if
this
is
how
it
should
taste
or
not
also
i
dont
know
if
i
like
this
style
yet
smells
all
cinnamony
spicy
and
sweet
has
a
white
head
with
lots
of
lacing
looks
good
smells
good
tastes
good
too
taste
is
rather
sweet
with
loads
of
cinnamon
and
maybe
a
little
clove
nice
bit
of
bitter
hops
to
balance
it
out
as
well
this
is
really
a
very
good
beer
much
nicer
than
i
was
expecting
notes
as
this
style
goesmany
fail
and
i
can
not
say
i
have
had
many
good
tasting
pumpkin
beers
this
one
was
good
i
can
say
this
is
more
of
a
seasonal
beer
so
i
try
to
enjoy
it
during
the
holiday
season
i
can
find
it
nowbut
i
refrain
poured
into
my
pint
glass
and
received
a
seethru
light
rubyred
body
with
a
creamy
onefingered
head
that
receeded
quickly
and
left
little
lacings
pumpkin
hit
my
nose
first
natch
then
some
grassy
hops
and
spices
like
pepper
also
picked
up
some
yeastsugar
in
there
because
i
picked
up
faint
traces
of
bubblegum
cinnamon
and
bread
malt
come
through
in
the
taste
but
it
is
more
hoppybitter
than
smooth
still
a
medium
body
with
the
hops
giving
off
light
citric
twinges
caramel
and
maybe
roasted
malt
mixed
in
too
ultimately
just
a
little
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
as
the
beer
was
too
sharp
to
be
completely
quaffable
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
will
not
buy
another
one
light
clear
orange
pour
with
a
large
offwhite
head
mild
pumpkin
spice
smell
perhaps
a
bit
less
so
than
average
body
is
watery
thin
and
flavorwise
is
probably
the
blandest
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
very
low
carbonation
as
well
adds
to
the
lifelessness
of
it
not
offensively
flavored
at
all
just
a
poor
pumpkin
beer
i
thought
clear
amberorange
with
a
fine
offwhite
cap
decent
head
retention
saw
the
foam
eventually
forming
a
thick
collar
and
producing
some
spotty
lace
pie
spices
in
the
aroma
cloves
a
bit
of
squash
and
marshmallow
perfumy
nutmeg
same
in
the
flavour
with
light
hop
bitterness
some
toasty
malt
for
balance
with
spices
lingering
in
the
finish
mediumlight
bodied
with
average
carbonation
fair
texture
i
liked
the
balance
on
this
one
not
over
the
top
with
spices
tasty
deep
amber
with
orange
hints
topped
by
a
thin
offwhite
head
aroma
has
some
caramel
and
a
hint
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
but
not
much
taste
is
fairly
flat
and
astringent
minimal
notes
from
pumpkin
more
woody
than
spice
of
any
type
mouthfeel
is
also
dry
and
thin
drinkability
its
drinkable
but
not
enjoyable
pours
a
fully
clouded
orange
brown
no
head
in
my
duvel
tulip
nose
is
very
mild
pumpkin
pie
with
spices
flavor
is
actually
pretty
decent
so
many
of
these
pumpkin
ales
are
disasters
this
one
comes
off
fairly
well
nice
balance
of
spices
that
dont
underdo
it
and
dont
overdo
it
feel
has
a
good
carbonation
to
it
and
the
liquid
is
decent
as
well
overall
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
here
cant
say
i
would
go
for
it
again
as
i
just
dont
really
care
for
this
style
but
you
might
as
well
give
it
a
shot
at
least
once
pale
copperorange
color
with
a
pretty
big
offwhite
head
that
settles
down
to
a
fuzzy
film
with
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
cinnamonnutmeg
and
pumpkin
with
some
bitter
grass
the
flavor
comes
on
a
bit
more
bitter
than
the
sweet
smell
but
it
holds
onto
a
tastey
pumpkinnutmeg
quality
well
carbonated
and
generally
a
good
feel
on
the
fizzy
side
as
others
have
mentioned
pretty
refreshing
goes
down
easy
but
the
bitterness
and
pumpkin
flavor
may
not
invite
over
indulgence
here
it
definitely
puts
a
little
bite
on
your
tongue
along
the
line
of
a
grainy
hop
i
think
it
is
both
different
and
likeable
but
i
would
not
be
inclined
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
i
think
its
not
stupendous
even
as
a
pumpkin
ale
but
i
must
admit
that
ive
only
had
one
pumpkin
ale
that
i
really
liked
a
lot
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
especially
since
i
have
a
six
pack
with
five
left
not
bad
at
all
though
poured
copper
orange
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
half
inch
of
cream
white
head
the
aroma
was
of
a
cold
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
nutmeg
ginger
allspice
the
taste
was
of
a
well
spiced
pumpkin
pie
nutty
spicey
and
of
pumpkin
it
was
wellbalanced
most
of
the
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
this
year
have
either
been
overspiced
or
underspiced
and
it
was
nice
to
have
a
balanced
one
for
a
change
the
feel
was
fizzy
and
creamy
some
reviewers
have
said
that
it
was
overcarbonated
but
i
feel
the
high
fizziness
gives
it
a
better
texture
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
this
year
and
one
i
look
forward
to
having
again
next
year
drinkability
i
wasnt
too
fond
of
it
not
something
i
would
try
again
i
like
fruit
beers
so
thought
i
would
like
this
it
just
wasnt
for
me
tasted
very
odd
to
me
drinkability
i
did
like
the
contrast
between
the
sweet
pumkin
taste
and
the
slightly
bitter
finish
i
would
have
it
again
a
quality
beer
from
brooklyn
dits
allright
not
the
best
pumkin
this
year
but
passable
i
have
one
more
and
will
drink
it
for
thanksgiving
its
actually
a
quite
nice
pumpkin
ale
my
only
valid
complaint
is
the
heavierthannormal
carbonation
its
just
a
little
too
fizzy
for
my
taste
oh
i
also
think
the
spice
flavors
could
be
a
little
more
intense
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
it
it
was
festive
for
the
season
and
i
enjoyed
the
spices
i
wouldnt
drink
this
yearround
but
certainly
during
the
fall
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
pumpkin
ales
a
lot
of
local
stores
started
carrying
this
beer
in
late
september
and
im
always
a
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
so
i
thought
id
try
this
one
it
pours
a
light
pumpkiny
orange
with
a
small
white
head
pretty
godo
retention
smells
and
tastes
of
the
pumpkin
plus
the
standard
spices
cinnamon
cloves
anise
etc
mouthfeel
is
light
but
too
fizzy
for
my
tastes
i
think
a
pumpkin
ale
should
be
a
bit
creamier
and
this
one
instead
bites
the
tongue
too
much
it
almost
overwhelms
the
flavors
overall
a
decently
drinkable
beer
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
out
of
the
many
pumpkin
ales
i
tried
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorites
despite
a
strong
pumpkin
flavor
there
was
a
strong
noticeable
bitter
aftertaste
which
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
in
my
opinion
there
are
much
better
pumpkin
brews
out
there
strong
hints
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
are
definitely
there
but
the
bitterness
destroyed
this
one
for
me
maybe
it
was
just
the
6pack
i
bought
could
be
that
this
was
an
older
sample
but
im
not
sure
if
it
was
a
recent
sample
then
i
really
wasnt
crazy
about
this
one
this
is
coming
from
someone
whos
tried
just
about
every
pumpkin
ale
out
there
much
better
choices
to
choose
from
really
not
sure
about
paying
7
50
for
this
one
again
but
if
youre
a
seasonal
ale
fan
its
worth
trying
at
least
once
this
is
the
pumpkin
beer
i
would
buy
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
sure
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
example
of
this
style
a
fine
pumpkin
ale
though
spiciness
that
lends
to
taste
brings
down
overall
drinkability
a
bit
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
imo
final
thoughts

not
much
in
the
way
of
pumpkin
pie
flavor
it
should
be
renamed
cinnamon
ale
because
it
totally
dominates
the
flavor
to
me
this
was
a
very
disappointing
experience
still
theres
a
crisp
rich
crystal
malt
flavor
here
too
and
it
serves
as
a
nice
backbone
for
the
brew
along
with
the
spice
and
the
notes
of
vegetal
pumpkin
flavor
one
really
does
get
the
sensation
of
drinking
a
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
in
the
finish
the
spices
especially
nutmeg
intensify
a
interesting
halloween
beer
but
once
a
year
is
probably
about
right
for
this
one
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
color
with
a
nice
head
smell
is
mild
but
pleasant
with
nutmeg
and
allspice
aromas
taste
has
a
real
pumpkin
flavor
to
it
and
quite
dominating
but
with
a
little
citrus
flavor
too
in
the
mouthfeel
you
get
high
carbonation
and
bitterness
the
flavor
sticks
around
in
your
mouth
for
a
while
but
instead
necessarily
a
bad
thing
this
is
the
first
time
having
this
beer
and
is
pleased
for
the
most
part
and
is
something
look
forward
to
in
the
fall
overall
a
decent
fall
beer
its
not
something
id
seek
out
but
something
id
definitely
drink
again
im
sure
it
will
find
its
way
into
a
mixed
sixer
of
pumpkin
beers
again
next
fall
d
wouldve
like
to
had
a
few
of
these
given
that
they
were
keeping
away
from
overdoing
the
sweetness
i
probably
wouldnt
order
this
again
if
there
are
other
pumpkin
ales
to
choose
from
overall
very
refreshing
and
better
than
expecting
very
sessionable
post
road
is
probably
the
least
favorite
of
any
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
it
has
a
great
appearance
however
it
has
a
smell
with
no
hint
of
pumpkin
it
definitely
comes
through
in
the
taste
as
i
couldnt
sense
even
a
slight
taste
of
pumpkin
i
am
surprised
they
can
even
call
this
a
pumpkin
beer
high
carbonation
makes
for
a
very
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
but
overall
its
very
lacking
a
matted
yeastiness
sticks
on
the
tongue
and
concludes
a
moderately
bad
beer
experience
i
would
suggest
reaching
for
just
about
any
other
pumpkin
selection
this
season
if
youre
looking
for
a
spicy
slightly
bitter
beer
this
is
the
pumpkin
for
you
if
something
a
little
smoother
with
a
more
pronounced
pumpkin
flavor
is
what
you
seek
id
recommend
giving
the
saranac
pumpkin
ale
a
try
not
the
best
but
certainly
not
the
worst
this
one
could
use
a
little
more
pumpkin
flavor
as
of
now
thansk
at
least
to
the
spices
it
seems
more
like
a
dull
and
watery
winter
warmer
its
worth
a
try
someone
should
at
least
find
this
one
to
their
tastes
my
first
pumpkin
ale
hope
it
was
last
years
batch
this
was
not
good
looked
ok
orange
amber
color
decent
light
tan
head
some
lacing
smell
had
some
kind
of
pumpkin
spice
fairly
mild
taste
was
not
good
skunky
cabbagy
taste
with
a
soapy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
drinkability
not
good
at
all
all
things
being
equal
i
would
take
a
bud
over
this
one
hands
down
i
want
to
try
a
few
more
pumpkin
ales
and
see
if
i
have
a
prejudice
against
the
style
or
if
a
guaranteed
fresh
one
purchased
in
the
fall
makes
a
difference
poured
a
orange
color
with
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
smell
is
of
spices
taste
is
of
spices
and
some
pumpkin
pretty
good
good
bit
of
carbonation
but
still
smooth
its
a
good
brew
good
taste
i
would
probably
get
it
again
its
worth
trying
sometime
overall
i
was
more
then
impressed
i
thought
this
was
wonderful
this
was
my
second
pumpkin
in
a
row
that
came
off
just
really
great
i
am
really
beginning
to
get
a
handle
on
the
style
and
really
actually
developing
a
liking
for
it
this
seems
like
the
perfect
mix
for
a
fall
night
and
really
something
i
would
like
to
try
on
tap
i
can
see
now
why
people
wait
for
this
to
come
out
every
year
really
a
fantastic
brew
and
an
excellent
choice
hands
down
at
5
this
is
superdrinkable
of
all
the
different
pumpkin
offerings
this
is
the
only
one
i
can
easily
enjoy
more
than
two
of
the
spice
doesnt
crawl
up
your
face
and
take
a
dump
into
your
sinuses
its
just
downright
pleasant
and
pumpkiny
yet
doesnt
let
you
forget
youre
drinking
beer
unlike
many
of
its
competitors
you
just
dont
mess
with
brooklyn
brewery
they
know
what
theyre
doing
d
one
or
two
of
these
per
season
isnt
bad
but
i
would
like
one
that
is
a
touch
sweeter
and
with
a
bit
more
alcohol
to
make
it
feel
more
seasonal
im
impressed
with
this
ale
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
sometime
good
beer
id
suggest
sam
adams
fall
brew
if
youre
looking
for
a
bit
more
spice
i
believe
serenac
was
a
bit
lighter
but
i
havent
had
it
this
year
and
could
be
completely
mistaken

i
just
recall
it
being
my
favorite
last
year
not
my
first
time
to
purchase
it
and
certainly
not
my
last
one
of
these
days
ill
purchase
all
the
pumpkin
beers
i
can
find
and
do
a
taste
off
really
great
all
around
good
appearance
good
auroma
good
taste
good
all
around
what
else
could
you
ask
for
in
a
pumpkin
ale
d
i
could
easily
have
another
and
would
enjoy
trying
this
brew
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
definitely
worth
a
try
though
i
dont
like
this
quite
as
much
as
dfhs
version
but
it
is
still
a
standard
for
me
in
the
fall
and
it
is
cheaper
pours
orange
with
a
thin
and
wispy
head
smell
is
of
nice
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
silky
pumpkin
well
balanced
and
with
some
late
maltiness
taste
is
similar
but
less
spicy
than
the
aroma
and
more
of
a
straight
pumpkin
taste
a
little
thin
and
slippery
up
front
the
spice
comes
into
play
more
on
the
finish
smooth
drinking
tasty
fall
beverage
this
beer
is
a
savory
fall
brew
it
has
a
very
good
aroma
that
captures
you
as
soon
as
you
open
the
bottle
the
aroma
is
that
of
a
fresh
pumpkin
pie
which
makes
it
the
perfect
fall
beer
the
strong
tones
of
nutmeg
make
this
pumpkin
beer
a
winner
it
has
a
very
good
mouthfeel
smooth
perfectly
carbonated
for
its
gravity
and
very
flavorful
certainly
no
enemy
of
flavor
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
out
there
overall
i
was
pleased
with
this
pumpkin
ale
not
quite
the
best
in
the
style
ive
had
but
better
than
most
nice
job
again
for
brooklyn

a

and
patchy
lacing

with

and
a
hint
of
ginger
in
the
background
plain
pale
malt
and
husky
flavors
upfront
followed
by
a
distant
pumpkin
core
taste
the
aftertaste
is
drying
with
cinnamon
allspice
and
ginger
slowly
emerging
bringing
a
about
a
faint
woody
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
i
like
a
more
residual
sweet
and
toasty
malt
profile
in
my
pumpkin
beers
but
this
leans
heavily
towards
crisp
and
dry
the
body
is
a
thinnishmedium
with
a
mid
to
high
carbonation
that
further
lightens
the
mouthfeel
finish
shows
mellow
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
faintly
perceivable
pumpkin
flesh
and
pale
malt
this
is
a
softer
and
more
approachable
pumpkin
ale
than
average
and
may
seem
unbalanced
to
someone
looking
for
a
malty
ale
with
lots
of
pumpkin
character
but
it
may
also
appeal
to
someone
that
desire
a
beer
with
just
a
pumpkin
spice
accent
that
holds
a
high
drinkability
after
the
good
looks
in
my
glass
it
was
pretty
much
downhill
from
there
mouthfeeldrinkability
alive
and
prickly
not
totally
elegant
but
better
than
average
it
pushes
the
spices
and
pumpkin
flavors
around
enough
to
get
all
the
nuances
great
drinkability
again
the
hops
rule
here
between
the
bone
dry
finish
and
the
bitterness
left
behind
i
cant
wait
to
grab
another
sip
terrific
beer
this
fall
season
added
note
after
reading
this
months
issue
of
beer
advocate
magazine
shameless
plug
i
saw
the
beer
floats
i
think
my
next
pumpkin
beer
will
be
served
as
an
ice
cream
float
yummy
dthis
is
a
good
all
around
beer
well
made
with
no
flaws
however
pumpkin
beers
can
either
be
sweet
or
dry
i
prefer
sweet
this
beer
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
slight
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
extremely
quickly
very
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
nice
nutmeg
pumpkin
slight
hint
of
cinammon
over
a
backdrop
of
what
smells
like
a
good
blend
of
hops
the
taste
follows
suit
you
pick
up
the
nutmeg
and
the
hops
and
a
fair
amount
of
the
pumpkin
the
carbonation
is
medium
but
it
goes
down
smooth
this
would
be
a
very
good
session
beer
good
solid
choice
for
the
fallwinter
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
for
a
pumpkin
ale
i
find
this
one
to
be
lighter
in
body
than
i
expected
carbonation
is
medium
in
level
and
the
brew
finishes
semidry
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
but
i
dont
think
that
ill
be
purchasing
it
again
there
are
others
out
there
that
are
way
better
on
draft
at
jacob
wirth
boston
ma
poured
into
a
plain
pint
glass
small
head
looks
like
a
normal
pale
ale
smell
of
nutmeg
is
quite
noticeable
first
taste
and
you
know
that
this
isnt
like
a
lot
of
other
pumpkin
ales
nice
hop
taste
along
with
slight
pumpkin
pie
spice
really
good
overall
also
a
very
striking
pumpkin
orange
tap
which
sticks
out
in
any
draft
line
pours
a
clear
tapered
copper
color
with
minimal
head
that
dies
down
to
leave
virtual
nothing
on
top
of
this
one
smell
is
like
sniffing
a
stick
of
big
red
cinnamon
gum
along
with
some
spices
taste
is
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
mouthfeeling
is
crisp
and
bold
a
decent
pumpkin
offering
poured
a
copperish
color
very
fall
looking
you
can
smell
a
fruity
kind
of
spice
in
the
nose
not
quite
pumpkin
pie
almost
more
like
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
meets
apples
and
pumpkins
im
not
too
schooled
on
pumpkin
ales
but
this
seems
to
be
fairly
balanced
and
drinkable
not
offensive
although
the
spice
does
build
slightly
all
in
all
very
nice
would
love
to
try
on
tap
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
nice
dense
cream
colored
head
some
nice
lacing
was
left
on
the
glass
as
i
drank
it
the
smell
is
rather
faint
for
a
pumpkin
ale
i
pick
up
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
this
ale
has
subtle
pumpkin
flavors
there
is
an
initial
hit
of
pumpkin
light
cinnamon
nutmeg
flavor
which
is
quickly
wiped
out
by
the
malty
presence
the
malt
border
lines
on
a
toasted
malt
so
this
beer
finishes
on
the
bitter
and
dry
side
i
would
expect
a
bit
more
sweet
spicy
flavors
out
of
a
pumpkin
ale
the
beer
has
a
moderate
body
and
well
carbonated
finishes
slightly
dry
this
pumpkin
ale
wont
blow
you
away
with
pumpkin
pie
like
flavors
but
at
least
it
is
not
cloying
as
some
pumpkins
tend
to
be
this
is
a
malty
brew
with
pumpkin
flavors
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
aroma
is
of
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
not
too
strong
either
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
upfront
with
the
pumpkin
quickly
fading
towards
the
back
of
the
tongue
theres
also
some
malt
in
it
but
for
some
reason
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
overkill
on
that
part
to
me
a
pumpkin
beer
should
be
slightly
sweet
mellow
and
go
down
smoothly
this
doesnt
fit
that
criteria
drinkability
after
finishing
the
entire
bottle
its
hard
not
to
come
down
with
a
small
case
of
hurt
feelings
especially
if
you
dont
have
a
rich
delicious
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
to
follow
it
up
with
drinkable
not
supposed
to
be
this
is
supposed
to
be
smelled
not
a
good
beverage
this
would
be
like
saying
hey
that
purfume
smells
good
lets
drink
it
on
my
quest
to
find
a
substitute
for
cottonwood
pumpkin
ale
i
stumbled
across
this
brew
after
being
burned
by
the
shipyard
pumpkinhead
ale
blech
i
was
hesitant
but
the
guy
at
the
liquor
store
said
this
beer
was
far
superior
to
that
beer
so
i
gave
it
a
try
man
was
he
right
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
taste
actually
has
undertones
and
tastes
like
it
was
made
with
pumpkins
opposed
to
having
a
tacked
on
taste
like
lots
of
pumpkin
brews
on
the
market
has
potential
to
be
a
good
session
beer
for
me
might
be
a
little
too
much
for
others
though
while
most
pumpkin
beers
are
one
and
done
for
me
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
tasty
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
you
need
to
have
a
liking
for
pumpkin
for
this
beer
because
its
very
pumpkiny
crisp
and
refreshin
not
real
smooth
but
i
dont
always
consider
that
a
bad
thing
either
this
one
might
be
furthest
from
the
true
style
but
nonetheless
quite
possibly
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
i
picked
up
this
beer
back
in
the
fall
and
it
has
been
languishing
in
the
back
of
the
beer
fridge
since
then
due
to
a
bit
of
burnout
on
fall
seasonals
at
the
time
which
left
this
beer
orphaned
as
winter
seasonals
moved
in
finally
decided
to
give
this
a
try
as
i
feared
it
would
be
fading
by
now
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
well
this
had
held
up
with
some
nice
bright
malt
flavor
and
a
wellbalanced
pumpkin
and
spice
note
the
spicing
was
nicely
moderated
prominent
but
not
overpowering
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
ive
had
i
didnt
realize
at
the
time
that
brooklyn
was
producing
this
but
that
explains
the
quality
d
an
overall
good
representation
of
the
pumpkin
ale
style
spicy
but
not
overdone
enough
real
pumpkin
flavor
to
give
an
ample
full
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
effervescent
sweet
and
pleasant
i
could
and
have
had
several
in
a
session
theres
a
little
volume
felt
as
it
goes
down
i
couldnt
put
many
of
these
down
initially
but
as
the
season
chilled
it
was
an
everyday
beer
practically
i
went
through
three
bottles
at
breakfast
with
a
stack
of
pancakes
thats
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
this
beer
is
a
nice
bright
orange
and
there
is
a
small
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
unmistakably
pumkin
the
taste
is
spiced
pumkin
pie
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
the
drinkability
is
good
and
i
could
have
this
beer
again
near
the
top
of
the
heap
for
the
style
overall
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
taste
not
as
good
as
the
aromas
indicated
but
worth
a
try
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
something
also
from
the
brooklyn
brewery
and
when
i
found
this
i
was
intrigued
sadly
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
as
it
were
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
winter
warmers
and
spiced
beers
and
this
was
in
the
same
vein
just
average
would
go
well
as
a
dessert
beer
for
a
turkey
dinner
the
highs
and
lows
in
style
range
so
much
that
overall
the
drawbacks
in
this
balance
out
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
the
taste
to
my
wife
for
being
ready
with
the
towel
pretty
good
beer
and
definately
nice
for
the
season
when
poured
it
was
a
deep
golden
amber
with
an
orange
hue
to
the
color
with
very
little
foam
or
lace
the
smell
of
all
spice
blew
my
socks
off
this
pumpkin
ale
is
the
closes
to
the
taste
of
pumpkin
that
ive
tasted
so
far
not
great
mind
you
but
not
bad
their
is
alot
of
spices
and
the
flavor
is
pleasant
and
not
over
powering
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
that
ive
tasted
so
far
one
of
the
better
fallpumpkin
beers
i
have
had
this
beer
drinks
very
easy
and
i
would
buy
again
when
in
the
mood
d
easily
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
look
forward
to
more
an
nice
version
of
the
style
its
drinkable
but
its
not
wonderful
the
fall
gimmick
is
to
make
beer
that
tastes
like
pumpkins
brooklyn
fails
but
not
as
badly
as
others
have
its
not
sticky
sweet
and
its
not
cloying
but
why
drink
this
unless
youre
set
of
having
a
pumpkin
beer
and
you
cant
find
a
better
one
i
can
see
why
brooklyn
leaves
the
post
road
label
on
this
one
see
my
review
of
smuttynoses
pumpkin
ale
for
more
senseless
pumpkinrelated
ranting
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
it
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
a
medium
bead
that
leads
up
to
an
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
the
bouquet
consists
of
floral
ale
esters
pumpkins
pale
malts
and
light
spicy
hops
it
tastes
like
strongish
clove
and
nutmeg
light
cinammon
and
allspice
along
with
pumpkins
some
pale
malts
and
a
mild
bitterness
on
top
of
a
light
dry
tingly
body
an
average
pumpkin
ale
now
but
when
it
originally
came
out
it
was
probably
one
of
the
best
an
average
pumpkin
ale
nothing
special
very
good
qualitystyle
wise
it
compares
to
punkin
ale
but
it
is
a
bit
more
tilted
towards
the
hop
score
downgraded
a
bit
on
mouthfeel
just
didnt
seem
appropriate
to
finish
as
dry
as
it
did
despite
the
mouthfeel
issue
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
enjoy
another
easy
to
drink
pleasant
tasting
priced
reasonably
a
truly
well
done
pumpkin
ale
da
ive
had
a
few
of
the
pumpkin
ales
recently
and
this
one
is
amoung
my
very
favorites
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
it
had
about
an
inch
head
it
was
a
dark
orange
pumpkin
color
it
looked
very
inviting
on
this
cool
evening
the
aroma
was
spice
and
pumpkin
the
flavor
up
front
was
all
spice
then
i
tasted
soap
i
thought
it
might
be
my
glass
so
i
got
a
new
one
and
the
flavor
still
was
soapychemical
i
let
the
beer
warm
up
a
bit
and
the
soapiness
seemed
to
go
away
a
bit
it
was
a
fizzy
medium
bodied
beer
if
it
were
not
for
the
first
soapy
flavor
it
would
be
very
drinkable
let
it
warm
up
and
you
will
enjoy
it
more
decent
brew
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
head
that
sticks
around
for
about
a
minute
it
smelled
a
little
bit
like
pumkin
and
sweet
malts
tasted
a
little
like
pumpkins
with
a
nice
spicybitter
aftertaste
which
is
the
best
part
goes
down
easy
but
it
is
just
an
average
pumpkin
ale
i
would
have
another
if
the
situation
arose
its
very
light
and
smooth
a
bit
creamier
as
it
warms
up
but
has
a
nice
dry
finish
a
very
cozy
autumn
beer
sweet
but
balanced
with
spiciness
decent
brown
sugar
ginger
allspice
nutmeg
and
clove
aroma
could
smell
all
of
these
but
all
were
weak
smelled
watery
good
long
finish
with
a
taste
that
rests
on
the
tongue
seemed
a
bit
thin
i
wouldve
like
more
malt
and
spiceness
in
this
one
probably
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
at
a
tailgate
party
wouldnt
get
drunk
as
fast
so
far
the
best
pumpkin
ale
yet
this
fall
next
up
dfh
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
quite
tasty
and
better
than
most
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
wholly
reccomended
if
you
enjoy
pumpkin
ales
or
just
want
to
celebrate
the
season
i
would
maybe
go
so
far
as
to
propose
this
as
a
light
pumpkin
ale
im
a
fan
of
brooklyn
but
they
kind
of
dropped
the
ball
on
this
one
id
stick
with
south
hampton
also
from
new
york
state
dogfish
head
or
smuttynose
if
you
can
find
them
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
color
was
a
nice
golden
hue
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
quickly
disappeared
aroma
smelt
of
spices
akin
to
pumpkin
pie
tasted
nice
slight
hint
of
the
spices
without
being
bitter
or
overly
spicey
was
pleasant
to
drink
felt
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
slight
aftertaste
but
hard
to
place
the
beer
was
slightly
sweet
but
not
in
a
honey
sweet
more
in
a
guord
sweet
i
e
pumpkin
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
of
the
style
i
have
had
nice
dirty
orange
pumpkin
pie
color
head
deminishes
quickly
aroma
is
malty
sweet
with
a
hint
of
nutmeg
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
peppery
biting
spice
pumpkin
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
not
overly
complex
but
easy
to
drink
light
and
crisp
unlike
many
pumpkin
ales
id
have
a
second
however
just
an
average
example
of
the
style
overall
a
terrific
pumpkin
ale
especially
for
the
price
beer
poured
out
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
mild
orange
mixed
in
smell
was
mild
some
obvious
pumpkin
but
it
was
not
overwhelming
taste
was
mostly
pumpking
with
some
mild
malt
as
well
all
in
all
taste
left
me
wanting
more
not
too
sharp
mouthfeel
fairly
light
somewhat
flat
average
at
best
it
was
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
nice
autumn
beer
not
the
best
pumpkin
my
first
experience
of
this
style
and
its
a
good
one
id
certainly
give
this
another
taste
and
it
makes
me
willing
to
explore
a
style
into
which
i
was
hesitant
to
venture
i
have
loved
pumpkin
ales
this
season
dont
know
why
just
do
this
is
a
very
decent
showing
from
brooklyn
amber
color
with
a
little
orange
tint
not
to
much
though
had
a
great
pumpkin
pie
type
smell
cinanamon
and
nutmeg
galore
only
problem
that
i
had
was
the
finish
which
was
a
little
grainy
better
than
most
pumkins
but
not
as
good
as
others
definetly
worth
a
try
copperamber
in
color
and
appears
thick
minimal
lace
floating
atop
very
sweet
honey
malt
and
fruity
taste
is
of
roasted
grains
yeast
general
spices
and
actual
pumpkin
lingering
in
the
background
as
for
the
spices
nothing
particular
jumps
out
at
the
beginning
but
notes
of
cinnamon
allspice
and
nutmeg
can
be
found
in
the
finish
medium
body
with
very
nice
carbonation
consistent
to
the
end
and
leaves
behind
a
bubbly
remnants
pours
out
a
nice
orangeamber
color
pretty
off
white
head
small
bubbles
that
lasts
a
few
minutes
good
retention
prominent
notes
in
the
nose
are
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
malt
sweetness
theres
also
a
some
other
spice
at
work
cinnamon
and
a
minimal
amount
of
banana
you
get
everything
in
the
taste
that
you
do
in
the
nose
but
the
cinnamon
is
stronger
here
very
drinkable
for
a
pumpkin
balanced
without
being
overly
pumpkined
or
overspiced
somewhere
between
lightly
carbonated
and
creamy
smooth
pumpkin
pie
spice
matched
with
the
flavor
of
a
lighter
ale
tastes
a
little
more
like
beer
than
other
pumpkin
beers
thats
not
a
bad
thing
as
its
more
of
a
kolsch
or
just
lighter
ale
almost
on
the
pumpkin
spice
end
of
the
spectrum
instead
of
simply
pumpkin
this
ones
about
as
hitor
miss
as
you
can
get
in
one
bottle
sadly
the
misses
are
a
little
hard
to
get
over
overall
a
good
drinkable
ale
however
that
lack
of
pumpkin
flavor
could
easy
make
this
beer
pass
for
a
simple
amber
ale
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
the
beer
has
no
off
smells
or
taste
the
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
oily
texture
but
this
adds
to
the
experience
this
beer
was
a
dam
tasty
beer
treat
i
could
easily
session
this
beer
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
apparently
taking
their
post
road
pale
ale
and
adding
pumpkin
spice
clove
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
look
is
a
crystal
clear
mix
of
copper
and
orange
with
an
abundance
of
carbonation
the
beer
just
looks
weak
aromas
of
clove
dominate
the
brew
with
backup
scents
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
malts
initially
wonderful
pumpkin
pie
flavors
and
malty
caramel
notes
but
the
flavors
quickly
weaken
under
the
timid
body
and
fall
apart
leaving
behind
a
hop
bittering
and
a
grainy
biteyness
the
beer
proves
to
finish
thin
and
unnecessarily
biteey
with
a
persistant
spiciness
not
bad
but
undermalted
and
noticable
at
many
parts
of
the
session
a
clean
orangyamber
beer
has
a
small
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
light
with
a
cereal
grain
malt
character
carrying
the
light
vegetable
pumpkin
note
along
the
malty
character
again
is
the
predominate
feature
in
the
flavor
with
tastey
pumpkin
notes
danceing
back
and
forth
on
your
tongue
tastes
more
like
a
beer
that
has
pumpkin
as
an
ingredient
than
a
pumpkin
beverage
that
has
some
beer
in
it
on
a
chilly
fall
evening
and
after
a
dull
day
this
might
change
my
perception
of
a
pumpkin
ale
creamy
spicy
and
good
carbonation
make
me
want
to
drink
another
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
id
like
a
fuller
body
in
my
beer
thankyou
ambience
college
football
fall
evening
john
lennon
the
smell
almost
like
pumpkin
pie
could
smell
pumpkin
and
the
right
amount
of
spice
aroma
however
in
the
taste
i
could
not
detect
any
of
spice
that
i
had
smelled
dissapointing
there
did
detect
a
slight
pumpkin
taste
mouth
feel
was
smooth
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
overall
decent
beer
would
drink
again
overall
i
had
this
one
a
few
years
ago
and
didnt
like
it
much
for
some
reason
i
decided
to
give
it
another
shot
and
am
glad
i
did
this
one
tastes
great
on
a
cool
evening
clear
amber
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
dissipates
quickly
very
spicy
smell
of
cinnamonnutmeg
with
faint
pumpkin
background
modest
carbonation
but
just
lacks
the
smooth
grace
of
a
truly
drinkable
ale
good
for
comparison
but
not
on
a
par
with
smuttynose
tastes
like
a
pumpkin
beer
man
these
things
are
getting
old
i
cant
wait
until
the
winter
seasonals
come
out
pours
a
light
amber
color
a
bit
orangeish
really
like
pumpkin
smell
is
very
nice
pumpkin
and
spice
particularly
clove
and
nutmet
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
light
crisp
maybe
a
bit
thin
even
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
spice
again
the
clove
and
nutmeg
in
particular
a
nice
pumpkin
flavor
not
overpowering
finishes
like
pumpkin
pie
on
the
palate
but
again
its
a
little
thin
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
very
drinkable
and
satisfying
on
a
cool
fall
day
d
novel
for
fall
months
nice
change
from
a
porter
or
a
sweet
stout
drinkability
not
going
to
be
a
session
for
me
one
was
plenty
it
took
some
real
hoppy
beers
to
get
the
clove
taste
out
of
my
mouth
drinkability
is
good
but
i
am
not
crazy
about
this
style
this
brew
is
a
good
to
better
example
of
the
style
and
it
is
well
balanced
mk
d
drinkable
but
to
an
extent
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
welcome
the
fall
season
i
love
fall
d
this
pumpkin
ale
avoids
the
pitfall
of
many
of
its
colleagues
overspicing
good
balance
here
pick
up
a
sixpack
and
enjoy
d
its
somthing
that
if
you
can
get
past
the
overpowering
bathroom
style
scented
candle
aroma
then
this
beer
is
for
you
overall
a
nice
fall
time
offering
and
probably
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
theres
a
nice
balance
of
pumpkin
flavors
and
pumpkin
spice
flavors
pick

decent

an
odd
but
good
bitternesss
in
the
aftertaste
crisp
for
a
pumpkin
ale
this
one
is
fairly
drinkable
but
i
probably
could
not
drink
more
that
2
in
one
sitting
usually
with
most
ales
of
this
type
i
can
only
drink
one
as
pumpkin
ales
go
this
one
is
preety
good
and
nice
to
pick
up
a
sixer
once
during
the
season
while
ive
been
known
to
enjoy
a
very
spicy
strongly
flavored
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
is
absolutely
wonderful
in
its
subtlety
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
spritzy
for
the
style
i
was
just
hoping
for
a
fuller
richer
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
high
as
this
is
pretty
light
this
is
not
bad
by
any
means
and
would
make
a
better
session
pumpkin
brew
than
the
one
blue
moon
makes
i
just
really
wish
this
had
some
more
body
and
flavor
thanks
to
ding
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
i
would
say
this
beer
is
slighty
underrated
on
this
site
its
no
smuttynose
pumpkin
ale
but
it
holds
its
own
i
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
beefed
up
a
tad
more
but
the
pumpkin
profile
works
nicely
like
most
ales
for
me
this
is
very
drinkable
by
that
i
mean
its
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
i
just
wish
there
was
more
flavor
more
aroma
this
is
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
pumpkin
ale
and
the
fall
this
is
to
easy
to
drink
in
the
warm
weather
ill
pass
next
time
i
inhaled
a
warm
noseful
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
over
the
orangetinged
white
head
not
to
mention
whod
a
thunk
the
aroma
of
pumpkins
fresh
or
stewed
pumpkins
not
roasted
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
contributed
most
to
the
taste
as
did
a
soapy
aroma
that
was
annoying
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
it
could
have
been
the
post
road
pumpkin
ale
is
a
gentle
brew
with
only
the
slightest
hops
bitterness
as
the
glass
warms
despite
its
relative
sweetness
and
its
specialty
flavoring
i
found
it
highly
drinkable
a
fine
beer
to
taste
on
its
own
or
to
quaff
at
dinner
overall
a
superb
pumpkin
ale
the
are
a
few
more
wellknown
brand
out
there
that
are
either
way
overly
sweet
syrupy
or
too
weak
and
bland
for
this
style
brooklyn
brewery
does
this
style
a
huge
credit
most
definitely
will
keep
this
on
hand
sept
nov
for
sure
overall
fairly
nondescript
beer
i
was
expecting
more
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
but
instead
got
a
decent
ale
it
wasnt
bad
but
wasnt
all
that
memorable
either
id
drink
it
again
but
would
hesitate
to
pay
out
the
premium
price
10
a
sixer
that
was
charged
in
the
store
d
its
good
but
theres
just
no
way
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
it
has
a
lot
of
really
big
flavor
and
it
would
be
too
much
to
try
and
turn
this
into
a
session
beer
as
a
one
and
done
beer
though
its
pretty
great
would
go
great
with
creme
brulee
or
cheesecake
this
wasnt
my
favorite
brooklyn
but
it
was
okay
i
havent
had
too
many
in
this
style
taste
was
a
bit
odd
for
me
too
much
and
not
enough
going
on
some
spicyness
too
much
nutmeg
not
enough
of
everything
else
ill
have
to
try
this
again
this
fall
pours
a
nice
coloration
of
a
mixture
of
gold
amber
light
brown
orange
and
red
solid
2
finger
head
that
quickly
recedes
to
heavy
lacing
i
cant
pull
my
nose
away
from
it
obvious
pumpkin
pie
smell
with
some
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
nice
balance
of
pumpkin
and
spice
the
most
pumkin
tasting
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
the
warming
cinnamon
flavor
feels
good
in
the
mouth
for
me
it
would
be
a
tough
beer
to
session
even
with
the
low
abv
givin
the
complexity
and
strength
of
the
flavors
after
two
i
would
be
ready
to
move
on
awsome
desert
beer
cheers
this
was
a
really
good
pumpkin
ale
well
balanced
flavors
for
the
expectation
you
get
from
the
aroma
good
looking
beer
a
definate
recommendation
for
those
who
like
a
beer
flavored
with
pumpkins
and
dont
want
to
drink
pumpkin
pie
cheers
d
i
wish
i
had
this
one
on
thanksgiving
a
great
match
with
almost
any
not
too
spicy
food
at
a
reasonable
abv
would
make
a
good
session
beer
as
well
a
really
great
pumpkin
ale
tastes
lightly
tart
surprisingly
lots
of
pale
malt
breadiness
then
the
spices
and
a
nice
clean
finish
crisp
and
dry
and
surprisingly
full
bodied
decent
drinker
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
this
seasonal
holiday
treat
a
tasty
and
substantial
beer
and
perfectly
in
season
my
favorite
pumpkin
so
far
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
pretty
boring
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
nice
though
with
notes
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
caramel
esters
and
light
grassy
hops
flavor
begins
with
a
nice
pumpkin
flavor
that
doesnt
taste
artificial
like
most
pumpkin
ales
followed
by
some
spices
nutmeg
and
allspice
caramel
toasted
bread
some
lightly
spicy
hops
and
some
esters
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
light
as
is
carbonation
but
drinkability
is
pretty
good
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
that
doesnt
taste
like
a
soda
worth
trying
at
least
once
not
really
impressed
with
this
pumpkin
ale
coloring
was
a
nice
deep
orange
pumpkin
smell
was
faint
pumpkin
taste
was
weak
a
bit
watery
for
a
pumpkin
ale
also
did
not
detect
as
many
spices
as
other
brews
this
doesnt
make
it
a
bad
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
i
just
feel
that
it
is
lacking
taste
and
heartiness
for
the
genre
drinkability
very
nice
natural
pumpkin
profile
i
would
add
a
bit
more
spice
but
otherwise
quite
drinkable
pours
a
pretty
transluent
light
amber
hue
topped
by
a
creamy
white
onefinger
head
aroma
of
light
sweet
malt
pumpkin
pie
and
the
faintest
touch
of
floral
hops
palate
is
defined
mainly
by
the
auxillary
spices
marjoram
nutmeg
a
hint
of
cinnamon
melded
with
light
sweet
malt
and
fairly
understated
pumpkin
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
on
the
palate
medium
body
is
appropriate
for
the
style
i
have
to
say
unlike
every
other
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
at
least
i
dont
hate
this
the
spices
are
relatively
muted
and
it
doesnt
end
up
tasting
like
a
glass
of
nutmeg
extract
decent
had
this
brew
on
tap
last
evening
brew
had
a
cloudy
yelloworange
color
with
a
thicker
head
that
had
pretty
good
retention
and
did
leave
some
lacing
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
pumpkin
pie
like
aromas
along
with
a
slight
sour
smell
had
nice
aromas
but
did
not
notice
strong
pumpkin
like
smell
that
i
was
expecting
but
that
could
have
been
due
to
the
fact
that
i
had
the
southampton
pumpkin
ale
offering
which
seemed
to
be
dominated
by
pumpkin
pie
tastes
overall
this
was
a
nice
brew
definitely
caught
the
taste
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
which
had
a
nice
balance
not
my
favorite
type
of
brew
but
something
i
feel
obligated
to
try
during
the
fall
will
have
it
again
purchased
a
6pack
bottles
at
my
local
package
store
did
not
know
at
the
time
that
this
beer
was
actually
made
by
the
brooklyn
brewery
although
it
was
a
pleasent
surprise
packaging
is
of
pumpkinautumn
motif
pours
a
warm
dark
amber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
smell
is
of
spices
similar
to
allspice
and
cloves
with
a
strong
pumpkin
aroma
although
smell
is
strong
its
not
overpowering
or
pungent
the
taste
of
this
beer
can
be
summed
up
with
the
whole
appearance
of
the
autumn
season
spices
and
pumpkin
are
mixed
with
the
taste
of
a
traditional
ale
solid
seasonal
ale
but
not
as
good
as
some
other
fall
tradionals
this
is
definately
something
that
you
could
drink
more
than
one
of
and
still
be
able
to
appreciate
drinkability
overall
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
but
could
use
more
character

oh
how
i
love
my
favorite
season
the
fall
and
beers
that
come
along
this
pours
a
nice
orange
amber
with
a
creamy
white
head
wgood
lacing
an
easy
way
to
sum
up
the
smell
would
be
pumpkin
pie
the
taste
rocks
lots
of
pumpkin
pie
flavors
including
clove
mouthfeel
is
light
but
creamy
lots
of
malty
sweetness
this
is
insanely
drinkable
they
played
this
brew
a
little
too
conservatively
but
all
in
all
pretty
good
overall
not
a
bad
brew
for
the
fall
or
early
winter
a
conservative
pumpkin
brew
but
why
be
conservative
with
this
genre
12
oz

with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
quickly
drops
to
a
film
and
collar
sticky
patch
lace
is
abundant
pie
spices
take
a
backseat
to
caramel
maltiness
and
herbal
hops
in
the
aroma
light
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
pie
spices
dominate
the
taste
if
not
the
aroma
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
flavors
are
most
assertive
with
malty
caramel
and
fresh
pumpkin
in
the
background
plenty
of
spicy
and
herbal
hops
provide
a
solid
bitterness
to
balance
decent
drinkability
for
a
pumpkin
ale
overall
a
pretty
middleoftheroad
pumpkin
beer
thats
not
going
to
knock
my
socks
off
but
is
still
solid
taste
a
nice
caramel
maltiness
is
offset
by
the
same
clean
hops
on
the
nose
which
provide
a
light
bittering
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
that
the
pumpkin
is
not
the
main
or
only
characteristic
there
is
an
agreeable
balance
mingling
with
the
sweet
malt
flavors
you
find
the
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
this
is
not
so
much
a
pumpkin
ale
as
it
is
an
ale
with
pumpkin
there
could
nonetheless
be
some
more
pumpkin
character
but
well
done
anyhow
drinkability
good
enough
to
make
it
a
session
without
any
cloying
and
lingering
sweetness
that
can
sometimes
effect
other
beers
with
the
potential
to
be
overspiced
and
maybe
oversweetened
with
something
as
singular
as
pumpkin
for
its
taste
clear
orangy
gold
no
head
i
can
smell
the
mild
brownish
fruit
and
not
spices
which
suits
my
preference
unfortunately
the
aroma
is
very
light
not
whetting
my
thirst
as
much
as
i
would
like
nondescript
maltiness
kind
of
coats
the
tongue
with
a
slightly
tangy
brown
sugar
but
without
the
sweetness
begins
with
pumpkin
but
ends
with
what
seems
to
be
some
kind
of
rot
not
an
awful
rot
but
just
a
bit
like
when
the
pumpkin
starts
to
go
soft
a
few
days
after
halloween
feel
is
flat
thick
and
syrupy
very
coating
not
pleasant
i
shared
a
bottle
of
this
with
my
wife
and
i
am
glad
that
i
did
you
can
take
that
either
way
youd
like
d
2155
is
the
date
so
brewed
in
july
it
was
new
in
the
store
but
if
this
beer
has
gone
south
i
owe
this
another
try
as
is
not
very
good
my
advice
is
to
try
dogfish
head
punkin
overall
not
as
good
as
dogfish
heads
version
but
this
one
isnt
that
bad
i
recommend
fans
of
pumpkin
ales
to
at
least
try
it
although
i
know
id
prefer
the
aforementioned
brand
if
i
had
a
choice
the
flavor
is
spicy
and
malty
the
pumpkin
is
somewhat
noticeable
but
more
apparent
in
the
aroma
a
bit
of
hops
also
become
present
in
the
finish
mouth
feel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
is
a
bit
oily
goes
down
easy
and
is
worth
a
try
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
versions
of
the
style
that
i
have
tried
if
you
are
going
to
brew
a
pumpkin
ale
dont
get
cheap
with
the
pumpkin
instead
of
being
a
pumpkin
beer
goldorange
body
with
a
small
offwhite
head
minimal
lacing
smell
is
very
nice
basically
consisting
of
malt
aroma
with
a
lot
of
spice
specifically
cinnamon
caramel
malt
flavor
lightly
hopped
with
a
mild
pumpkin
taste
not
overdone
like
other
pumpkin
ales
a
crisp
finish
without
much
of
an
aftertaste
except
for
a
little
dry
bitterness
and
a
very
light
pumpkin
flavor
thinner
than
expected
probably
two
pints
max
of
this
one
for
me
the
taste
is
similar
heavy
on
the
pumpkin
and
light
on
the
spices
the
maltiness
of
the
beer
is
weak
which
gives
it
a
thin
feel
in
the
mouth
it
is
okay
just
not
a
special
ale
much
thanks
to
necoadam
for
providing
ahh
the
pumpkin
ale
is
a
more
perfect
marraige
between
fruit
and
beer
answer
yes
but
it
is
a
good
combo
im
always
on
the
search
for
the
perfect
pumpkin
ale
post
roads
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
it
has
a
nice
dark
amber
color
and
a
bit
of
a
malty
odor
the
taste
is
somewhat
smooth
with
barley
and
malt
overtones
and
some
bitterness
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
this
one
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
falls
quickly
and
leaves
a
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
has
more
of
a
pumpkin
smell
and
less
of
the
spices
interesting
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
real
pumpkin
taste
but
the
spices
are
subdued
in
the
back
ground
the
malt
character
could
be
stronger
here
to
give
it
better
body
it
seems
a
little
thin
also
it
could
use
a
bit
more
of
the
spices
to
make
it
stand
out
thanks
nickbagofdonuts
for
the
beer
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
it
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
smell
has
lots
of
pumpkin
a
little
spice
and
a
little
bit
of
maltiness
pretty
nice
smell
not
too
overpowering
the
taste
has
lots
of
pumpkin
as
well
but
not
as
much
spice
as
in
the
aroma
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
weird
not
sure
whats
going
on
there
the
body
is
just
a
little
bit
light
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
though
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
this
one
pours
an
orange
color
wtih
a
slight
head
taht
falls
to
cover
the
beer
the
nose
is
a
lot
of
the
pumpkin
with
the
spices
hidden
in
the
background
the
alcohol
is
also
a
bit
aparent
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
just
what
the
nose
tells
me
pumpkin
with
hidden
spices
the
flavor
is
also
a
bit
thin
and
watery
the
feel
is
pretty
thin
as
well
drinkability
is
also
okay
i
would
take
other
pumpkin
ales
over
this
one
any
day
its
just
lacking
overall
its
ok
its
certainly
well
crafted
but
just
doesnt
standout
as
a
must
try
again
beer
drinkability
overall
quite
delicious
and
enjoyable
pours
a
clear
medium
copper
with
a
sizeable
sandy
offwhite
foam
the
aroma
comes
up
with
a
whiff
of
hops
in
the
first
sniff
but
after
it
sits
for
a
few
minutes
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
come
out
and
overtake
the
hops
the
caramel
malt
flavors
meld
nicely
with
the
pumpkin
you
can
actually
pick
out
the
pumpkin
flavor
in
this
and
not
just
the
spices
and
spices
to
make
for
a
decent
beer
still
id
like
to
see
this
with
a
little
more
body
and
a
little
chunkier
malt
otherwise
its
good
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
at
all
poured
with
a
generous
head
that
was
long
llived
and
left
nice
lacing
in
a
clean
pint
glass
orange
amber
color
smell
was
cloves
yeast
pumpkin
and
pepper
taste
was
yeasty
and
weak
some
spice
thankfully
not
overstated
but
no
real
body
and
not
a
hint
of
malt
thin
and
poorly
balanced
hence
the
poor
review
i
will
try
again
and
maybe
rewrite
this
review
pours
an
golden
amber
color
with
a
medium
white
head
smell
is
delicious
with
pumpkin
pie
spices
cinnamon
and
allspice
this
beer
smell
is
making
me
hungry
for
punkin
pie
taste
is
of
smooth
caramelized
malt
and
pumpkin
pie
spice
with
a
sharp
balancing
hop
very
interesting
spiced
ale
worth
picking
up
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
good
white
head
fair
amount
of
carbonation
subtle
odor
of
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
definitely
a
fall
in
new
england
kind
of
smell
great
combination
of
pumpkin
flavor
and
maltiness
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
i
could
see
the
pumpkin
taste
becoming
a
bit
much
after
more
than
two
or
three
but
a
nice
change
from
some
of
my
usual
year
round
beers
flavor
noticable
pumpkin
with
supporting
but
not
overpowering
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
good
balance
between
the
malt
pumpkin
and
spices
i
have
to
raise
my
2
6
score
but
i
still
wonder
about
that
bad
bottle
pours
dark
amber
minimal
head
with
little
retention
smells
of
pumpkin
and
spice
what
else
would
it
be
like
however
i
expected
more
from
the
nose
no
hops
malt
just
some
spices
and
pumpkin
flavorings
its
a
good
beer
but
its
rather
light
i
expected
a
heavier
more
potent
brew
for
the
time
of
year
but
its
nice
if
you
want
just
a
little
light
beer
i
would
consider
the
post
road
pumpkin
to
be
the
lightest
tasting
of
the
pumpkins
ive
tried
this
yeardfh
and
boston
beer
works
the
beer
poored
and
nice
dark
amber
with
little
whote
head
which
didnt
last
too
long
the
beer
gave
off
a
light
smell
of
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
rather
than
nutmeg
and
others
spices
that
are
common
in
pumpkin
style
beers
the
taste
was
light
and
again
not
too
spicey
and
had
a
light
bitterness
overall
i
like
this
beer
not
my
favorite
but
currently
running
2
in
the
pumpking
category
fall
like
tears
from
weeping
trees
very
smooth
and
creamy
maltiness
with
a
riding
wave
of
pumpkin
as
the
carbonation
tickles
your
tongue
it
feels
like
a
spicy
flavored
brown
ale
i
really
liked
this
and
much
better
than
the
dfh
punkin
i
had
yesterday
medium
bodied
it
finishes
very
clean
making
it
very
easy
drinking
and
worth
a
few
it
also
isnt
too
malty
or
spicy
from
making
you
want
to
have
a
couple
i
do
not
like
pumpkin
ale
i
do
not
like
post
road
pumpkin
ale
it
pours
orangy
amber
with
a
white
head
composed
of
tiny
bubbles
leaves
light
wispy
lacing
this
beer
is
loaded
with
halloweeny
pumpkiny
spices
its
sweet
and
cloying
and
all
together
not
to
my
liking
one
of
the
very
few
not
spoiled
not
macro
brews
that
i
have
swilled
down
the
drain
in
the
life
one
of
the
better
versions
of
the
style
ive
had
in
a
long
time
its
not
a
style
that
i
would
drink
all
night
but
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
it
on
a
cool
autumn
night
this
is
the
version
that
ill
be
going
back
to
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
at
first
but
seemed
to
fizz
out
and
little
head
which
soon
disappeared
has
a
straight
pumpkin
aroma
no
spice
sort
of
a
bland
buttery
pumpkin
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
it
has
a
bland
sort
of
pumpkin
taste
finishes
with
sort
of
a
roasted
almost
burnt
pumpkin
taste
has
a
medium
body
and
surprisingly
leaves
little
aftertaste
not
bad
but
i
have
to
believe
there
is
a
lot
better
out
there
overall
this
far
easier
drinking
than
i
had
expected
there
is
no
substantial
build
up
of
flavor
and
several
of
these
can
go
down
without
feeling
pumpkined
out
color
is
goldenamberorange
about
1
centimeter
of
head
but
light
and
fluffy
slight
cream
color
in
the
head
eventually
fades
into
a
very
thin
foam
layer
aroma
is
distant
pumpkin
pie
have
to
really
take
a
whiff
to
to
smell
it
taste
is
a
bit
disappointing
mediocre
at
best
seems
to
heavy
on
the
nutmeg
not
as
authentic
pumpkin
pie
tasting
as
it
could
have
been
on
a
positive
note
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
light
to
medium
bodied
and
pleasant
overall
not
impressed
there
are
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
for
example
buffalo
bills
a
load
of
spicy
pumpkin
flavour
balance
quite
well
to
some
biscuity
maltiness
sublte
but
effective
hopping
lends
some
earthiness
orange
flavour
medium
bodied
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
what
fall
is
all
about
pours
out
a
deep
orangeamber
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
head
that
stays
with
you
for
a
little
bit
smell
was
pure
pumpkin
and
spices
reminds
me
of
thanksgiving
time
with
the
pumpkin
pie
aromas
also
some
malts
and
fruits
are
hidden
in
the
background
taste
was
ok
lots
of
pumpkin
flavors
hit
the
palate
first
then
the
spices
blend
in
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
other
spices
in
light
doses
mediumish
body
with
a
ok
amount
of
carbonation
perhaps
a
little
too
much
but
thats
ok
it
didnt
kill
the
taste
in
any
way
i
wouldnt
mind
having
one
but
that
would
be
about
it
i
dont
know
if
i
would
want
more
than
one
of
these
not
bad
drinkability
this
catches
up
quickly
and
begins
its
weight
sooner
than
it
ought
to
having
had
far
too
many
pumpkin
ales
this
season
this
one
has
nothing
to
distinguish
itself
the
mouthfeel
was
nicely
dry
and
roasty
and
did
not
convey
a
watered
down
impression
at
all
a
sessionable
charming
beer
that
is
quite
different
from
the
hop
monsters
i
usually
crave
but
a
quality
brew
nonetheless
oelergud
apparently
brooklyn
brewery
distributes
this
stuff
although
it
is
made
in
ct
somewhere
i
have
only
seen
it
in
a
couple
of
bars
and
sometimes
places
will
sell
it
in
bottles
where
a
good
brooklyn
selection
is
available
at
least
its
not
under
the
brooklyn
label
because
i
might
have
to
write
the
good
folks
there
and
inform
them
that
there
reputation
as
premier
new
england
brewery
is
being
marred
by
this
mediocre
beer
pours
a
clear
clear
orange
with
the
aroma
of
spices
and
pumpkin
the
taste
however
is
round
a
bit
yucky
with
pumpkin
coming
out
and
this
weird
hop
roundness
coming
to
the
fore
ends
bitter
but
with
what
seems
to
be
little
malt
backup
the
spices
intersect
in
this
weird
way
to
leave
a
bitter
taste
in
the
mouth
long
after
the
beer
is
gone
mouthfeel
is
fine
good
drinkability
is
affected
by
its
overall
bitterness
definitely
a
beer
to
have
once
then
move
on
to
something
else
compared
this
pumpkin
ounce
for
ounce
with
cottonwoods
and
by
far
the
inferior
brew
no
real
taste
of
pumpkin
yet
strong
spices
overwhelm
the
taste
and
smell
almost
too
much
average
in
terms
of
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
maybe
i
just
enjoyed
the
cottonwood
pumpkin
too
much
to
make
a
fair
assessment
drinkability
this
beer
was
really
nice
and
hit
the
spot
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
the
pumpkin
taste
gelled
quite
well
with
the
standard
beer
ingredients
and
were
mild
enough
not
to
detract
from
the
beeractually
added
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
element
i
would
recommend
this
one
a
must
try
here
is
a
pumpkin
beer
that
intices
one
to
new
flavors
while
still
retaining
the
essence
of
a
very
good
beer
mild
as
it
hits
your
lips
then
moves
to
a
very
spicy
flavor
not
a
lot
of
pumpkin
to
it
more
the
nutmeg
and
spices
associated
without
the
sweetness
long
spicy
finish
bender
factor
i
we
have
really
gotten
into
the
pumpkin
style
instead
of
taking
the
time
and
mess
to
bake
a
pie
i
suggest
2
sixers
of
pumpkin
ale
maybe
you
will
finally
get
along
with
your
inlaws
if
you
bring
this
for
thanksgiving
dinner
instead
of
cranberry
sauce
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
this
beer
will
surely
creep
up
on
me
in
a
hour
or
so
i
am
planning
on
handing
out
samples
of
this
to
the
trick
or
treaters
this
year
i
saw
this
beer
at
the
store
last
night
since
i
was
unfamiliar
with
the
brewer
i
didnt
pick
up
the
6
and
that
was
a
good
decision
i
had
dinner
at
bison
county
this
evening
and
they
were
just
putting
on
a
fresh
keg
i
have
to
say
i
was
disappointed
it
poured
a
nice
deep
ambercopper
color
but
hardly
any
head
again
fresh
keg
no
lace
to
speak
of
in
my
glass
the
nose
was
mainly
cinnamon
with
just
a
touch
of
pumpkin
and
a
little
malt
the
taste
was
all
spice
it
was
full
of
nutmeg
allspice
and
cinnamon
no
pumpkin
to
speak
of
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
holiday
ale
which
it
should
not
it
had
a
real
watery
thin
mouth
feel
overall
i
was
mildly
disappointed
with
this
beer
ontap
at
colter
bay
in
buffalo
poured
an
orangy
amber
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
aromas
of
roasted
malts
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
maybe
a
bit
of
ginger
too
im
not
a
big
alternative
brew
kind
of
person
but
this
really
isnt
halfbad
upon
first
sip
it
comes
across
a
bit
aggressive
but
some
amber
ale
qualities
creep
their
way
into
the
overall
experience
rather
slick
on
the
tongue
not
too
shabby
but
it
does
not
taste
enough
like
beer
through
all
the
spices
the
beer
after
its
dislocation
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
nice
orangeamber
color
with
a
medium
sized
frothy
light
tan
head
and
after
its
erosion
the
lace
forms
a
nice
sealing
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
is
pumpkin
duh
and
a
nice
biscuit
like
aroma
fresh
sweet
and
quite
appetizing
with
the
start
ambrosial
the
malt
delectable
and
the
top
middling
in
feel
finish
as
a
meaningful
acidity
with
the
hops
blending
perfectly
with
the
malt
and
pumpkin
dry
as
a
desert
bone
aftertaste
and
a
fine
drinking
beer
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
beer
a
little
too
spicey
not
enough
pumpkin
flavor
i
know
i
shouldnt
but
i
cant
help
compare
this
to
cottonwoods
pumpkin
this
is
no
where
near
close
seems
too
hoppy
to
me
for
a
fruit
beer
i
expected
more
smell
too
its
drinkable
but
i
think
i
would
prefer
it
paired
with
food
not
by
itself
its
needs
something
to
hold
it
up
one
maybe
two
is
enough
for
me
pours
a
golden
amber
with
off
white
head
that
falls
quickly
aroma
is
big
and
good
lots
of
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
with
dash
of
cinnamon
really
pumpkin
pie
like
taste
is
not
as
good
light
pumpkin
malt
flavored
with
nutmeg
and
hops
lightly
bitter
overall
a
pretty
average
pumpkin
ale
mouthfeel
light
side
of
medium
could
be
little
heavier
in
body
drinkability
is
not
bad
but
given
choice
there
are
better
pumpkin
ales
available
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
this
bottle
light
in
body
with
some
medicine
flavors
apparent
a
slightly
bitter
finish
that
is
preceeded
by
nutmeg
but
not
a
lot
of
pumpkin
characteristics
to
this
one
punkin
ale
from
dfh
is
a
better
choice
big
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
the
bottle
it
poured
with
a
light
caramel
color
with
a
thin
head
and
little
lace
it
smells
like
a
pumpkin
but
with
something
extra
like
a
spicy
kick
when
downing
this
beer
i
noticed
that
the
spicier
malt
flavor
superceded
the
pumpkin
characteristic
the
mouthfeel
is
very
grainy
to
me
it
finished
a
little
woodsy
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
not
one
of
the
best
pumpkins
ive
had
and
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
ive
spent
the
winter
becoming
accustomed
to
the
intense
sweet
spiciness
of
harpoon
winter
warmer
so
im
not
sure
if
im
judging
this
one
fairly
but
it
seems
a
bit
too
woody
to
me
its
not
a
bad
woodiness
but
its
predominance
makes
the
flavor
a
little
topheavy
and
onedimensional
thats
my
only
complaint
here
i
like
choices
and
would
choose
this
one
again
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
and
spices
mostly
cinnamin
i
rather
like
the
smell
of
pumpkins
in
a
beer
the
taste
was
decent
pumpkin
ales
have
a
very
distinct
flavor
i
dont
know
if
its
good
or
bad
but
it
definately
stands
out
the
mouthfeel
was
fine
this
is
a
low
bodied
ale
that
is
rather
drinkable
for
those
who
enjoy
exotic
beers
this
is
a
good
seasonal
ale
post
road
was
an
above
average
beer
with
a
nice
taste
i
wish
there
were
more
of
a
pumpkin
flavor
and
less
clove
a
good
first
or
dessert
beer
no
more
than
two
for
me
i
think
a
friend
of
mine
who
tasted
it
before
i
did
put
it
best
when
they
stated
it
tasted
watery
it
pours
an
amberorange
color
with
an
offwhitetan
head
into
my
16
oz
brooklyn
brewery
pint
glass
smell
and
aroma
is
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
you
definitely
know
you
are
drinking
a
pumpkin
ale
i
used
to
really
enjoy
1
or
2
of
these
right
around
halloween
but
find
myself
not
enjoying
it
as
much
the
last
few
years
still
a
decent
beer
but
my
least
favorite
offering
from
my
favorite
brewery
alright
im
gonna
get
all
crazy
on
you
guys
and
review
my
first
pumpkin
never
had
it
before
so
im
interested
its
pours
a
beautiful
amber
with
a
decent
head
smells
of
tasty
spices
and
light
hops
yum
first
off
i
expected
a
sweet
spiced
concotion
but
this
aint
it
it
def
tastes
like
a
beer
and
isnt
masked
by
a
bunch
of
crap
it
is
lightly
bitter
and
lightly
sweet
at
the
same
time
a
certain
hop
character
shines
through
with
just
hints
of
spice
and
caramels
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
it
is
light
easy
drinking
and
killing
a
few
would
be
no
problem
a
fine
beer
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
compared
to
the
smuttynose
it
has
more
natural
pumpkin
flavor
while
the
smutty
is
more
like
pumpkin
pie
pumpkin
ale
eh
alright
ill
bite
pours
a
nice
amberorange
with
a
quickly
dissapating
head
spicy
aroma
with
cinammon
and
nutmeg
mouthful
was
thinner
than
expected
taste
was
more
cn
spices
admittedly
ive
never
eaten
pumpkin
before
as
the
thought
for
whatever
reason
repulsed
me
so
i
cant
say
whether
its
pumpkin
im
tasting
inoffensive
but
i
was
unable
to
finish
it
open
wide
drain
quite
similar
to
the
dfh
punkin
ale
but
with
2
minor
flaws
in
my
eyes
it
pours
a
nice
amber
colour
with
a
bit
of
a
head
that
dissolves
quite
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
smells
how
one
would
think
a
pumpkin
ale
would
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
the
pumkin
dominating
in
smell
and
taste
the
taste
parallels
the
smell
but
relies
too
much
on
the
pumpkin
flavouring
its
not
overbearing
but
just
not
as
balanced
as
it
could
or
should
be
the
other
flaw
was
that
the
brew
was
a
bit
more
watery
than
i
had
hoped
for
a
fuller
body
would
have
been
nicer
but
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
taste
solid
malt
and
pumpking
flavor
with
a
good
backing
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
good
bit
of
pepper
and
bits
of
hops
not
completely
balanced
a
little
watery
and
thin
very
drinkable
but
i
expected
a
little
better
from
our
friends
at
brooklyn
maybe
im
holding
the
bar
too
high
very
solid
performer
the
flavor
is
very
spciy
with
the
same
spices
noted
in
the
aroma
a
peppery
sense
accompanies
the
flavor
and
creates
warmth
the
feel
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
and
this
combined
with
the
spicy
nature
limits
the
drinkability
beyond
special
occasions
i
havent
had
many
pumpkin
ales
but
brooklyn
has
made
a
not
bad
beer
thats
more
than
just
a
novelty
my
compliments
for
another
job
well
done
for
garrett
and
company
looked
good
poured
a
rich
amber
color
the
first
sip
was
encouraging
the
old
familiar
pumpkin
and
spices
but
then
something
happened
that
i
havent
had
happen
in
a
long
time
the
beer
became
weaker
and
less
tastefull
with
each
sip
it
finally
became
a
chore
to
drink
the
last
3oz
it
just
doesnt
stand
up
clear
orangy
color
with
a
nice
tannish
head
i
pocked
up
hints
of
ginger
cinnamon
and
clove
this
has
a
very
nice
smooth
taste
and
very
well
balanced
nice
blend
of
spices
not
over
powering
id
have
to
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
hasnt
tried
spiced
beers
before
as
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
wonderful
aroma
of
spices
i
couldnt
pick
up
any
pumpkin
though
of
the
4
or
5
pumpkin
beers
ive
sampled
this
is
definitely
the
most
wellrounded
and
drinkable
nice
job
brooklyn
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
one
session
as
the
flavor
is
offbeat
and
more
of
a
novelty
then
a
solid
session
beer
nevertheless
a
nice
fall
seasonal
and
a
fine
tribute
to
my
favorite
dessert
not
a
bad
brew
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
but
really
not
enough
beery
flavors
to
balance
out
the
spices
i
was
getting
a
bit
sick
of
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
by
the
end
of
the
pint
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
and
worth
a
try
if
youre
into
that
sort
of
thing
it
was
thorougly
enjoyed
a
good
punkin
ale
though
light
on
the
pumpkin
and
high
on
the
ale
but
good
enough
in
some
aspects
not
the
best
of
the
pumpkin
patch
but
i
am
glad
to
see
brooklyn
has
this
one
now
backwash
i
normally
love
the
combination
of
flavors
in
pumpkin
pie
and
done
right
it
makes
a
good
beer
the
one
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
that
i
liked
was
made
for
rodneys
oyster
house
in
toronto
and
was
thick
and
rich
like
a
porter
its
silky
texture
and
slight
sweetness
even
made
it
seem
like
pumpkin
pie
this
on
the
other
hand
was
more
like
a
post
road
pale
ale
with
an
infusion
of
some
spices
i
cant
give
this
my
recommendation
starts
with
a
four
fingered
white
head
that
goes
quickly
but
leaves
a
good
lace
strong
nutmeg
nose
nearly
the
same
as
a
pumpkin
pie
and
there
is
pumpkin
in
the
background
nice
clear
amber
color
starts
malty
and
hoppy
and
finishes
hoppy
with
some
bitter
undertones
label
does
not
mention
the
brooklyn
brewery
drinkability
definitely
a
novelty
beer
but
quite
good
nonetheless
i
might
have
one
of
these
near
thanksgiving
or
once
in
a
blue
moon
a
great
way
to
kick
off
the
fall
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
light
almost
non
existent
headaroma
is
nutmeg
and
cloves
just
right
for
a
pumpkin
pie
flavor
is
not
as
sweet
as
some
other
pumpkin
ales
with
the
spicey
ness
coming
thru
as
it
warms
with
a
nice
lingering
maltiness
in
the
finish
i
notice
a
slight
hopdryness
in
there
as
well
a
pretty
good
beer
but
new
holland
ichibod
ale
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
so
far
appearance
pours
with
a
caramel
amber
body
and
a
cream
colored
foaming
creamy
textured
looking
head
leaving
a
nice
collar
of
lace
already
thick
and
even
patches
aroma
wow
when
i
popped
the
top
the
pumpkin
pie
like
tone
just
engulfed
my
senses
very
intriguing
cinnamon
and
other
spices
blend
perfectly
with
the
malts
used
here
somewhat
of
a
nut
quality
comes
by
my
senses
as
well
but
its
safe
to
call
it
pumpkin
pie
flavor
a
solid
base
of
caramel
malt
blended
with
silky
cream
and
spiced
pumpkin
weird
and
different
but
very
quaffable
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
for
body
but
texture
is
silky
smooth
drinkability
i
can
honestly
say
one
of
these
is
probably
enough
not
something
to
imbibe
in
quantity
but
to
really
enjoy
and
treat
as
a
dessert
or
somewhat
of
a
novelty
not
bad
just
not
a
creation
meant
to
be
drank
frequently
possibly
a
once
a
year
beer
here
not
an
in
your
face
pumpkin
beer
by
anymeans
what
really
makes
this
beer
stand
out
is
how
fresh
and
real
the
pumpkin
meat
and
soft
pumpkin
pie
spice
flavors
are
very
drinkable
and
simple
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
defaintely
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
i
was
expecting
something
weak
on
the
pumpkin
taste
but
it
was
like
a
liquid
version
of
a
pumpkin
pie
with
5
0
alcohol
of
course
its
cheap
and
i
like
it
a
lot
i
guess
the
only
down
falls
of
it
are
the
pure
sweetness
of
it
and
the
lack
of
a
real
head
thats
cool
though
it
was
still
really
good
a
big
pumpkin
fan
in
general
perhaps
i
got
my
expectations
up
too
high
for
this
one
i
will
not
be
purchasing
this
again
post
road
tastes
like
you
might
expect
a
pumpkin
ale
to
taste
combining
the
classic
flavors
of
pumpkin
pie
with
a
wellbalanced
beer
its
best
feature
is
in
its
subtlety
as
it
is
definitely
a
beer
and
not
a
fruitbased
brew
like
hard
cider
pours
copper
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
of
nutmeg
and
allspice
with
a
hint
of
hops
taste
starts
out
sweet
with
spicess
and
finishes
with
a
little
hoppy
bitterness
reminds
me
of
the
spicess
in
pumpkin
pie
not
necessarily
the
pumpkin
itself
worth
getting
the
one
time
of
year
its
available
2003
vintage
copper
color
with
a
beige
foamy
lumpy
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
aroma
is
of
sweet
floral
hops
and
pumpkin
hops
first
pumpkin
second
flavor
is
fullon
pumpkin
pie
with
a
strong
accompanying
nutmeg
flavor
hops
come
through
in
the
finish
followed
by
a
lingering
nutmeg
flavor
smooth
and
round
mouthfeel
not
overpowering
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
all
around
a
good
beer
especially
for
a
pumpkin
brew
but
this
could
stand
a
little
more
work
it
poured
orange
with
no
fogginess
with
a
white
head
the
smell
was
dominated
by
pumpkin
taste
was
good
with
subtle
hints
of
spices
and
toasty
malts
but
i
must
complain
that
the
mouthfeel
was
way
too
watery
for
me
with
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
taste
this
beer
will
certainly
become
one
of
my
mainstays
when
the
wind
is
whipping
pours
a
light
golden
amber
color
with
rich
thick
slightly
offwhite
foam
that
leaves
good
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
pumpkin
pie
spices
malt
citrus
and
floral
hops
a
modest
but
good
aroma
the
taste
is
mild
hops
some
spices
malt
and
a
lingering
light
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
light
medium
body
hoppy
but
backed
by
some
malt
sweetness
and
mellowed
by
the
pumpkin
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
though
not
as
full
bodied
and
rich
as
some
update
four
years
later
i
am
still
drinking
post
road
and
it
is
still
the
best
i
look
for
it
every
fall
thanks
to
davo
for
this
halloween
treat
not
too
spicy
for
a
pumpkin
ale
very
drinkable
pours
a
nice
amber
color
not
too
dark
very
subtle
aroma
of
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
slight
clove
just
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
taste
with
a
smooth
clean
finish
definitely
need
more
than
one
again
very
drinkable
not
bad
orangish
copper
color
with
a
low
light
tan
head
but
decent
carbonation
light
spice
aroma
and
light
spice
flavor
more
pumpkin
flavor
than
spicy
a
bit
too
subtle
for
me
not
spicy
enough
but
a
good
pumpkin
flavor
this
beer
was
med
bodied
and
smooth
though
so
would
definitely
have
more
than
one
pours
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lace
malt
in
the
nose
with
some
spice
aroma
medium
body
and
smooth
mouthfeel
i
was
afraid
that
the
pumpkin
flavor
would
turn
me
off
after
a
bit
but
that
was
not
the
case
tastes
like
a
good
ale
with
pumpkin
and
spice
in
the
backround
aftertaste
is
like
a
pumpkin
pie
but
not
overwhelming
very
tasty
mike
perhaps
the
most
attractive
aspect
of
this
beer
is
the
clear
glowing
orange
color
warm
pumpkin
spiciness
on
the
nose
although
pumpkins
are
not
predominant
in
the
flavor
rather
wellbalanced
ale
which
doesnt
submit
to
its
namesake
good
balance
of
hops
and
maltiness
followed
up
with
the
pumpkin
flavor
and
spicy
warmth
finishes
a
bit
short
though
the
aftertaste
is
agreeable
not
blown
away
but
a
good
beer
to
harken
in
the
fall
season
pours
a
nice
orangish
copper
holor
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
smooth
maltiness
in
the
nose
with
a
less
overpowering
spiciness
than
others
of
this
kind
smooth
maltiness
eases
into
the
brew
with
a
mellow
hoppiness
in
the
background
before
the
roasted
pumpkin
flavor
comes
into
play
there
is
also
a
slight
metallic
flavor
that
lends
a
crispness
to
the
brew
and
makes
it
surprisingly
crisp
while
also
staying
rather
smooth
and
very
drinkable
amber
in
color
with
a
lacy
top
the
beer
smelled
like
i
had
anticipated
and
hoped
the
aroma
consisted
of
malt
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
were
right
there
from
the
start
however
the
pumpkin
wasnt
too
overwhelming
and
malt
and
toasted
grains
were
noticed
it
finished
nicely
bitter
from
the
hops
which
helped
cut
down
of
the
noticable
sweetness
the
only
downside
to
this
was
after
my
senses
became
used
to
the
pumpkin
the
beer
started
smelling
like
warm
milk
im
glad
to
see
that
the
pumpkin
was
not
overdone
in
this
one
nice
medium
body
and
appropriate
carbonation
i
would
say
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
expereince
i
love
this
beer
beautiful
orangeamber
perfectly
fitting
the
style
of
beer
smells
very
nice
like
ginger
and
spices
but
not
overpowering
initially
has
a
wonderful
hop
flavor
followed
in
the
end
by
a
warm
taste
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
spice
a
wonderful
brew
for
a
cool
fall
evening
or
really
for
any
other
time
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
of
this
still
i
somehow
seem
to
be
chasing
the
memory
of
a
terrific
pumpkin
ale
i
had
years
ago
i
dont
recall
the
brand
nothing
seems
to
measure
up
to
memory
well
its
better
than
bills
pumpkin
ale
but
i
just
do
not
understand
the
pumpkin
ale
thing
i
dont
like
pumpkin
pie
and
it
is
much
worse
in
a
beer
a
few
of
my
buddies
loved
this
so
i
gave
it
a
try
it
was
a
big
mistake
again
it
is
better
than
the
other
pumpkin
i
have
had
but
it
is
still
just
not
right
to
me
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
restrained
carbonation
that
helps
to
accentuate
the
maltiness
rather
than
the
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
gently
crisp
the
flavor
is
obviously
spicy
but
reveals
some
soft
fruity
maltiness
as
well
the
bitterness
is
appropriately
light
allowing
the
spice
to
counteract
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
very
well
balanced
the
finish
is
fairly
short
with
a
lingering
spiciness
throughout
the
glass
however
the
spice
tends
to
build
on
the
palate
still
a
very
nice
beer
with
alot
of
finesse
a
nice
change
of
pace
light
amber
with
an
orange
hue
thick
smooth
white
head
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
spiciness
dominate
the
nose
with
a
little
malty
sweetness
underneath
low
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
quite
slick
and
creamy
the
pumpkin
spices
are
also
the
dominant
feature
of
the
taste
whats
nice
is
that
you
get
the
essence
of
pumpkin
pie
without
the
sweetness
i
dont
find
this
a
particularly
malty
beer
a
crisp
hop
bitterness
follows
the
spiciness
and
the
spices
return
going
into
a
relatively
short
finish
a
fall
seasonal
that
would
also
be
a
nice
treat
on
a
winters
night
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
this
brew
a
nice
little
fall
brew
as
others
have
stated
its
a
bit
like
having
some
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
golden
amber
in
color
with
a
nice
sticky
white
head
aromas
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
just
a
hint
of
pumpkin
in
the
taste
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
are
the
most
pronounced
flavors
but
theyre
not
overwhelming
some
malty
sweetness
again
somewhat
pielike
leaves
a
bit
a
spicy
grittiness
in
your
mouth
a
nice
treat
at
this
time
of
year
though
i
can
only
drink
one
at
a
time
pours
a
bright
orange
copper
color
with
a
small
but
steady
cream
head
on
the
nose
there
is
spices
nutmeg
coriander
and
hint
of
caramel
mouthfeel
is
smooth
on
the
palate
it
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
but
it
not
overly
done
earthy
hop
character
spices
nutmeg
coriander
nice
underlying
malt
sweetness
bready
caramel
finish
is
grainy
and
sweet
a
nice
fall
seasonal
and
a
tasty
treat
pours
with
a
thin
pearl
head
that
stayed
throughout
the
entirety
bright
orange
color
the
nose
is
enormous
with
ginger
and
pumkin
pie
first
taste
little
too
cold
which
hid
the
malt
and
most
of
the
pumpkin
flavoring
very
hoppy
and
too
much
yeast
character
but
as
it
warmed
it
became
very
well
balanced
with
nice
finish
a
sticky
offwhite
head
is
what
youll
get
after
pouring
this
into
the
glass
sitting
atop
brilliant
orangeygold
liquid
nose
is
redolant
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
of
course
malty
sweet
undertones
follow
the
spiciness
taste
is
crisp
pumpkin
pieish
with
hoppiness
making
a
good
showing
finishes
sweet
then
drying
out
nicely
a
treat
to
drink
on
the
cool
nights
of
late
summerearly
fall
i
thought
i
wasnt
going
to
like
this
but
i
did
what
a
treat
it
was
like
pumpkin
pie
in
beer
form
a
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
cool
fall
evening
good
for
one
or
two
but
hardly
a
session
beer
taste
of
pumpkin
is
there
but
doesnt
overpower
the
beer
a
fun
beer
good
drinking
for
a
spiced
brew
100
times
better
than
buffalo
bills
pumpkin
pee
i
think
this
beer
is
better
now
that
brooklyn
brewery
has
it
under
its
wing
notes
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
to
be
had
pumpkin
pie
all
over
its
generally
hard
to
have
more
than
one
pumpkin
ale
in
a
row
however
this
one
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
its
like
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
and
just
as
rich
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
aroma
and
flavor
not
sweet
they
kept
this
a
nice
ale
and
did
not
try
too
hard
to
make
this
into
a
liquid
dessert
although
i
like
this
beer
a
few
a
season
is
enough
for
me
clear
copper
tight
tan
head
toasty
malted
grain
and
spice
aroma
flavors
blend
well
one
single
component
doesnt
dominate
well
constructed
brew
that
evenly
displays
maltiness
and
spiciness
cinnamon
nutmeg
very
tasty
and
a
nice
holiday
changeup
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
at
one
sitting
though
great
spiced
beer
nicely
balanced
and
the
aroma
is
to
die
for
will
go
great
with
thanksgiving
dinner
its
the
closest
thing
you
can
get
to
pumpkin
pie
in
liquid
form
an
okay
pumpkin
ale
with
a
good
aroma
but
an
average
taste
but
it
does
come
with
a
nice
abv
of
8
making
it
a
little
stronger
than
some
of
the
other
ones
this
was
really
good
the
first
time
i
tried
it
but
the
second
six
pack
i
bought
tasted
overly
sweet
with
hints
of
bubble
gum
that
kind
of
ruined
it
for
me
im
not
big
on
pumpkin
ales
but
this
one
hits
just
the
right
note
of
subtle
spice
and
clean
hops
perfect
for
thanksgiving
dinner
my
wifes
favorite
pumpkin
beer
she
didnt
used
to
be
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
until
this
one
not
too
sweet
or
wimpy
good
choice
for
sure
not
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
a
worthy
effort
o
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
bravo
schlafly
finally
it
has
a
really
nice
orange
color
to
it
this
kicks
off
my
lengthy
halloween
season
and
carries
me
all
the
way
through
the
holidays
nothing
but
warm
happy
feelings
ill
usually
stock
up
enough
to
even
have
a
bottle
or
two
to
spare
for
pumpkin
beer
bread
at
thanksgiving
and
an
ice
cream
float
on
my
birthday
lately
it
seems
to
appear
a
little
earlier
every
year
but
i
cant
find
it
in
me
to
complain
share
this
with
your
friends
who
are
wary
of
beer
and
of
pumpkin
brews
and
with
those
who
are
wasting
cash
on
lackluster
pumpkin
ales
from
bigger
names
o
interesting
pumpkin
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
but
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
would
be
a
bit
much
for
more
on
this
beer
and
others
check
out
httpjoyofconsumption
com
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
with
a
little
abv
burn
light
carbonation
and
a
very
spicy
finish
thats
typical
of
a
pumpkin
beer
or
winter
warmer
this
was
good
but
the
spices
need
to
be
dialed
back
a
little
for
me
to
really
want
to
have
this
again
o
overall
tasty
but
i
feel
like
it
has
been
hyped
up
a
bit
and
gauging
from
the
price
of
the
6
pack
that
seems
to
be
true
for
a
pumpkin
beer
its
good
for
the
price
pumpking
is
more
enjoyable
o
pumpkin
beers
are
difficult
and
this
one
strikes
a
good
balance
of
pumpkin
sweetness
and
pie
spice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
solid
overall
tasty
and
drinkable
i
dont
need
much
more
out
of
a
pumpkin
ale
it
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
like
some
other
reviewers
here
but
its
a
perfectly
serviceable
pumpkin
ale
during
a
pumpkin
taste
test
between
my
wife
and
i
this
won
hands
down
it
struck
the
right
balance
between
the
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
and
non
sweet
pumpkin
and
a
big
amber
ale
smell
was
the
spices
of
a
pie
right
to
the
nose
delicious
the
8
was
extremely
well
hidden
best
schlafly
beer
ive
had
this
is
a
perfect
pumpkin
ale
the
pumpkin
really
kicks
through
not
overly
spicy
but
has
that
apple
pie
undertone
smooth
ale
taste
a
slight
bit
tart
in
a
good
way
a
mild
bitter
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
well
balanced
i
love
it
i
do
believe
there
is
a
ceiling
for
this
style
and
this
beer
has
possibly
reached
it
quite
simply
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
o
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
four
years
ago
i
remember
liking
it
better
then
pumpkin
beers
are
not
as
high
up
on
my
list
as
they
used
to
be
that
being
said
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
o
very
few
pumpkin
beers
are
able
to
accomplish
a
balance
with
all
of
the
necessary
ingredients
of
this
style
this
is
one
of
them
the
only
thing
that
keeps
it
from
being
a
higher
rating
is
that
the
sweetness
seems
to
linger
a
bit
much
as
it
warms
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
its
balanced
well
and
it
delivers
as
advertised
it
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
its
a
nice
fall
treat
i
will
get
more
next
year
aroma
is
real
nice
wafts
of
pumpkin
pie
reminiscent
of
the
filling
aroma
has
hints
of
cinnamon
and
caramom
good
but
lacked
something
i
found
was
hoping
for
more
pie
flavor
like
in
the
aroma
glass
nonic
the
most
balanced
pumpkin
beer
the
texture
is
medium
slightly
oily
and
highly
carbonated
overall
id
have
to
say
i
am
really
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
liked
that
the
actual
pumpkin
flavor
was
there
and
not
just
pumpkin
pie
spice
deep
reddishamber
color
not
much
head
dissipates
quickly
big

aroma
spicesnutmeg
cinnamon
pumpkin

big

to
full
bodied
taste
is
of
pumpkin
pie
filled
with
sweetness
spices
not
too
sweet
also
not
syrupy
but
its
a
big
pumpkin
ale
and
definitely
a
sipper
wish
it
was
thanksgiving
with
this
one
nothing
comes
close
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
of
the
season
put
a
cinnamonnutmeg
rim
on
the
glass
and
youve
got
a
glass
of
pumpkin
pie
intense
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
with
a
luscious
deep
orangered
color
taste
is
strong
pumpkin
pie
very
sweet
with
a
malty
finish
that
is
as
close
to
pumpkin
pie
as
you
get
there
is
an
alcohol
presence
which
detracts
but
overall
a
great
pumpkin
o
a
good
beer
maybe
i
judged
it
too
harshly
i
just
compare
this
one
to
good
gourd
and
alewerks
and
find
those
two
far
better
as
for
pumpkin
beers
this
one
is
my
favorite
hands
down
smooth
with
just
the
right
level
of
pumpkin
flavor
not
pumpkinpie
mind
you
while
retaining
its
characteristics
as
a
beer
o
probably
the
best
fall
beer
i
have
ever
had
perfect
balance
great
tasting
and
makes
the
fall
even
more
beautiful
amazing
beer
as
of
this
writing
my
new
favorite
beer
drank
it
at
el
bait
in
des
moines
september
2014
if
you
want
an
easier
drinking
subtle
pumpkin
i
would
suggest
the
dogfish
head
if
you
want
a
more
filling
one
closer
to
pumpkin
pieroll
this
is
what
you
need
velvety
soft
blanket
of
vanilla
and
cinnamon
initially
tastes
and
smells
more
like
a
sweet
baked
good
than
a
beer
but
a
nice
balanced
beer
profile
soon
emerges
abundantly
spiced
but
not
too
sweet
and
cloying
cool
piney
hops
bring
up
the
rear
and
make
for
a
clean
finish
no
hint
of
the
big
8
abv
pretty
impressive
and
dangerously
drinkable
t
on
the
pumpkin
beer
spectrum
that
ranges
from
pumpkin
pie
to
gourd
in
flavor
i
would
argue
that
schlafly
is
more
on
the
pumpkin
pie
side
in
fact
i
would
say
this
beer
tastes
strongly
of
rich
pumpkin
pie
filling
there
is
also
something
in
the
taste
that
reminds
me
a
bit
of
apple
cider
the
spices
are
great
and
really
build
as
i
was
drinking
despite
the
richness
this
beer
somehow
managed
not
to
be
too
heavy
or
cloying
had
another
tonight
45
degrees
wow
save
all
your
bottles
for
cold
fall
evenings
and
pair
with
an
apple
or
pumpkin
dessert
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
do
so
it
is
a
much
better
value
than
pumking
you
can
get
a
6
pack

amazing
this
and
ofallons
pumpkin
beer
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
and
i
make
it
a
point
to
try
all
of
them
outstanding
clean
pumpkin
ali
with
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
all
the
aroma
you
would
expect
yet
very
light
and
refreshing
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
brown
little
to
no
head
overall
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
some
pumpkin
beers
focus
too
much
on
the
spices
all
the
way
through
but
this
one
has
a
good
balance
between
spices
and
the
sweet
mashed
pumpkin
out
of
several
pumpkinspice
beers
ive
tried
this
is
absolutely
the
best
yet
schafly
has
yet
to
produce
a
beer
that
wasnt
outstanding
awesome
pumpkin
ale
ooverall
i
like
this
beer
it
prefect
for
your
pumpkin
ale
fix
very
strong

better
then

o
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
for
a
pumpkin
ale
one
of
my
new
favorites
o
i
had
heard
good
things
about
this
pumpkin
beer
and
im
a
sucker
for
pumpkin
pies
and
spices
generally
this
balances
this
melange
of
flavors
against
a
more
traditional
ale
structure
the
result
is
perhaps
the
most
solid
take
on
the
pumpkin
beer
ive
found
to
date
delicious
served
up
at
50f
in
a
samuel
adams
pint
glass
poured
a
darkgolden
copper
with
a
nice
one
finger
cap
that
quickly
dissipated
at
the
nose
cinnamon
pumpkin
spice
malt
and
cloves
first
taste
medium
body
with
a
nice
malt
pumpkin
pie
taste
that
finish
a
little
dry
at
the
end
probably
because
of
the
8
0
alc
all
in
all
a
well
crafted
pumpkin
ale
to
ring
in
the
start
of
the
fall
season
cheers
i
am
simply
not
a
fan
i
know
so
many
people
that
rave
about
this
pumpkin
ale
and
compared
to
other
varieties
available
it
just
falls
short
excellent
brew
i
always
look
forward
to
fall
and
this
beer
in
particular
im
not
crazy
on
pumpkin
ale
but
if
i
had
to
choose
one
this
definitely
takes
the
cake
the
best
ive
ever
had
as
far
as
the
style
goes
the
only
8
pumpkin
beer
i
can
knock
a
few
back
of
without
too
much
nutmeg
or
cinnamon
messing
up
the
palate
highly
recommended
advertises
a
pumpkin
pie
flavor
and
delivers
with
no
remorse
or
apology
otherwise
solid
without
any
negative
qualities
the
degree
of
pumpkin
pie
taste
in
this
brew
is
intense
and
rivaled
by
none
in
my
experience
thus
far
leans
to
the
sweet
side
everything
i
would
ever
hope
a
pumpkin
ale
to
be
not
only
promised
but
realized
prost
with
its
punchy
yet
balanced
flavor
profile
and
fuller
bodied
mouthfeel
schlaflys
pumpkin
ale
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
yet
to
dry
i
really
hope
this
brewery
distributes
to
new
england
sometime
soon
overall
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
if
available
in
your
area
i
would
highly
recommend
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
it
has
wonderful
balance
and
a
solid
body
with
a
rich
taste
i
feel
that
too
many
pumpkin
beers
have
a
very
sugary
taste
but
schlafly
nailed
this
one
i
get
a
deep
flavor
of
cinnamon
pumpkin
spice
clove
and
a
very
small
tone
of
cranberry
it
is
layered
wonderfully
and
is
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
overall
most
pumpkin
ales
teeter
one
way
or
the
other
but
this
one
gets
it
right
best
balance
ive
had
from
one
yet
id
put
it
over
st
pumpking
for
sure
just
wish
i
was
drinking
this
in
october
and
not
june
o
i
think
this
might
be
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
slightly
higher
than
dogfish
head
punkin
and
pumking
great
balanced
spices
and
great
pumpkin
flavor
great
tasting
beer
which
appears
tastes
to
change
slightly
every
year
i
believe
this
was
one
of
the
first
pumpkin
beers
i
ever
tried
and
to
date
is
still
my
favorite
there
are
lot
of
things
going
on
w
this
beer
that
make
it
a
great
try
for
people
of
many
different
tastes
i
would
recommend
this
beers
as
a
must
try
to
start
out
your
fall
season
every
year
my
pour
created
two
fluffy
fingers
of
deeptan
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deepcopper
srm
22

with
filamentquality
brightness
nose
was
very
sweet
and
spicy
and
since
they
were
going
for
pumpkin
pie
i
would
say
that
they
hit
the
mark
the
label
mentioned
cinnamon
its
super
drinkable
at
8
and
it
feels
like
6
its
a
well
crafted
beer
not
a
very
complex
brew
in
the
sense
that
it
is
very
spiceforward
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
the
front
and
bitterness
in
the
back
not
bad
by
any
means
but
nothing
really
stand
out
oan
absolute
great
pumpkin
ale
especially
for
a
12oz
best
taste
for
the
money
compared
to
other
pumpkin
ales
decent
pumpkin
beer
not
too
sweet
with
lots
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
brown
with
little
carbonation
and
no
residual
head
or
lacing
the
nose
is
a
rumlike
mix
of
spices
and
booze
caramelized
sugar
and
some
gourdy
undertones
the
taste
transcends
the
beers
nose
and
appearance
bringing
potent
pie
spices
to
the
forefront
big
pumpkin
sweetness
and
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
sweet
bodied
slightly
booze
so
spiced
that
its
gritty
but
also
with
an
elegant
gourd
presence
great
drinkability
and
has
a
mildly
biting
bitter
finish
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
and
think
its
refined
enough
to
do
well
at
the
dinner
table
but
would
likely
not
be
my
goto
beer
out
at
a
bar
o
a
very
good
very
solid
pumpkin
beer
very
nicely
put
together
overall
this
definitely
goes
in
my
top
5
pumpkin
beers
this
kinda
takes
everything
i
like
about
dfh
punkin
well
balanced
good
gourd
huge
clovesweet
pumpkin
though
more
subdued
and
pumking
going
to
seek
out
more
schlafly
now
pretty
decent
pumpkin
ale
not
overbearing
on
the
pumpkin
tastes
but
what
is
there
is
noticeable
and
pretty
good
tasting
i
am
a
huge
pumpkin
beer
fan
gotta
love
that
time
of
the
year
when
they
start
popping
up
on
the
shelves
in
numbers
that
being
said
ive
had
a
number
of
pumpkin
beers
and
nothing
comes
even
remarkably
close
to
schlaflys
pumpkin
ale
the
best
way
for
me
to
describe
it
is
like
pumpkin
pie
in
liquid
form
you
would
never
guess
the
abv
based
on
the
way
it
tastes
goes
down
very
smooth
if
you
are
a
pumpkin
beer
fan
this
is
a
must
have
for
you
price
point
2
5012
oz
single
when
i
think
of
pumpkin
beer
i
cringe
theyre
usually
overspiced
and
incredibly
sweet
schlaflys
pumpkin
ale
is
adequately
spiced
nicely
pumpkinized
and
all
around
delicious
this
drinks
more
like
a
beer
than
an
overly
sweet
dessert
i
would
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
the
fall
if
youre
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
this
is
the
best
ive
ever
run
across
give
it
a
go
thanks
matt
o
pretty
good
it
makes
sense
why
this
is
one
of
the
more
popular
pumpkins
it
might
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
like
ultrafine
grownup
apple
juice
but
drinkable
especially
in
smaller
quantities
o
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
if
your
looking
for
a
pumpkin
beer
that
tastes
similar
to
pumpkin
pie
definitely
go
for
this
beer
all
time
favorite
pumpkin
beer
the
finish
is
kind
of
bitter
which
stands
out
as
it
doesnt
really
poke
through
anywhere
else
overall
fairly
creamy
very
drinkable
a
good
pumpkin
ale
without
looking
i
never
would
have
guessed
this
was
8
alcohol
hidden
very
very
well
im
going
to
bring
a
couple
of
these
back
to
seattle
with
me
as
my
good
friend
and
former
roommate
is
a
huge
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
beer
fan
and
i
think
hed
really
appreciate
this
one
personally
i
probably
wont
pick
up
another
6
pack
for
personal
consumption
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
in
season
if
you
have
any
interest
in
the
style
at
all
overall
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
for
a
session
the
style
holds
a
special
place
for
me
as
it
was
the
style
for
my
first
review
many
seasons
ago
it
is
the
only
pumpkin
brew
i
faithfully
get
every
fall
awesome
brew
schlafly
o
very
similar
to
the
whole
hog
pumpkin
i
had
a
couple
of
days
ago
in
both
profile
and
overall
quality
these
are
among
the
best
pumpkins
ive
tried
and
clearly
the
best
of
the
5
ive
had
over
the
past
3
days
more
clove
in
the
schlafly
slight
preference
for
the
whole
hog
this
is
a
nice
seasonal
ale
going
with
the
current
trend
of
higher
abv
which
seems
to
work
well
considering
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
this
hits
the
right
notes
without
being
overly
sweet
like
most
pumpkin
ales
another
hit
in
the
schlafly
collection
i
might
not
have
had
the
best
available
beer
when
i
originally
reviewed
this
on
my
rereview
i
am
getting
all
of
the
good
from
the
original
review
and
almost
none
of
the
bad
the
beer
is
perhaps
a
little
on
the
light
side
but
i
think
the
pumpkin
spice
is
perfectly
balanced
against
a
background
of
a
familiar
beer
taste
dark
fruit
tones
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
but
definitely
not
the
flatness
i
got
in
the
first
review
i
actually
bumped
up
my
review
over
5
on
the
rereview
lipsmackingly
good
one
of
the
few
pumpkin
beers
ive
really
enjoyed
this
year
this
is
up
there
with
good
gourd
in
terms
of
how
much
this
smells
and
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
the
smell
is
really
something
on
this
one
highly
recommend
if
you
are
interested
in
pumpkin
beers
and
havent
tried
this
one
yet
osolid
pumpkin
beer
but
lacks
depth
of
flavor
and
complexity
of
some
others
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
hands
down
i
will
admit
i
have
only
had
a
few
different
pumpkin
beers
some
good
some
not
so
good
but
i
recommend
this
pumpkin
brew
for
anyone
who
has
not
tried
one
as
well
as
veteran
pumpkin
boozers
pick
this
up
n
stash
it
for
later
in
the
year
this
is
very
good
but
not
the
greatest
an
easy
rating
of
4
to
4
25
very
smooth
and
drinkable
for
8
abv
o
incredible
beer
by
all
means
this
and
alewerks
take
the
trophy
home
for
pumpkin
beers
this
year
and
probly
all
years
to
come
this
lives
up
to
expectations
and
might
even
surprise
you
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
now
when
it
is
released
get
it
mail
order
it
do
whatever
you
need
to
do
to
obtain
it
if
you
are
a
pumpkin
beer
drinker
as
it
will
change
your
pumpkin
beer
life
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
make
no
mistake
about
it
the
alchohol
content
seems
much
more
balanced
than
pumking
and
the
aftertaste
is
way
more
soothing
but
i
still
like
southern
tier
pumking
better
because
it
just
seems
to
have
more
of
a
pumkin
pie
taste
and
the
higher
alcohol
content
makes
it
more
refreshing
but
no
question
if
i
could
find
a
case
of
this
i
would
purchase
it
in
a
heartbeat
wouldnt
mind
having
one
around
the
holidays
a
buddy
at
work
brought
me
one
of
these
otherwise
we
dont
get
em
in
colorado
poured
from
an
unassuming
looking
brown
bottle
with
a
yellow
and
orange
label
into
a
bulleit
bourbon
glass
pours
deep
orange
with
a
light
yellowed
head
of
foam
that
disappears
before
too
long
aroma
is
very
discernible
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
clove
heavy
on
cinnamon
and
cola
excellent
flavor
again
heavy
on
cinnamon
but
thoughtfully
balanced
against
the
other
spices
sweet
and
malty
certainly
pumpkin
pie
like
as
they
say
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
leaves
a
light
tingle
on
the
tongue
if
you
chew
it
a
little
the
alcohol
really
separates
out
from
the
other
flavors
and
you
realize
what
youre
actually
drinking
which
is
a
pretty
high
abv
brew
that
is
not
playing
around
as
much
as
the
seasonal
flavors
suggest
overall
this
did
not
disappoint
certainly
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
been
able
to
try
pretty
masterful
o
love
this
beer
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
out
there
great
use
of
pumpkin
not
too
much
but
enough
for
you
to
know
that
its
there
like
the
higher
abv
of
this
beer
also
great
fall
beer
might
have
to
track
down
some
more
of
this
for
thanksgiving
o
this
one
had
been
recommended
and
now
i
see
why
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
the
robustness
of
schlaflys
pumpkin
ale
makes
it
a
winner
the
flavors
stand
up
like
a
defensive
line
and
knocks
you
on
your
ass
like
a
pumpkin
upside
the
head
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
one
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
and
rates
up
there
with
dogfishhead
for
me
it
is
a
bit
more
muddled
than
punkin
and
not
quite
as
refreshing
but
this
beer
hits
all
of
the
proper
flavor
notes
a
must
try
for
the
style
overall
a
tasty
full
bodied
pumpkin
ale
overall
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
far
from
great
in
my
opinion
after
reading
the
hype
i
was
unpleasantly
surprised
i
hope
that
i
got
a
bad
batch
and
next
time
ill
give
it
another
go
pours
a
honey
brown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
poor
retention
and
no
legs
to
speak
of
nose
redolent
of
spice
especially
clove
and
cinnamon
just
a
hint
of
pumpkin
detected
the
best
way
to
describe
the
taste
is
to
compare
it
to
warm
pumpkin
pie
the
pumpkin
that
was
almost
undetectable
in
the
nose
come
through
beautifully
on
the
palate
balancing
the
spice
perfectly
some
alcohol
warming
finishes
slightly
sweet
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
overall
a
very
smooth
and
well
crafted
pumpkin
ale
my
first
beer
from
schlafly
lovin
it
i
will
say
up
front
i
really
dont
like
pumpkin
pie
but
i
like
this
beer
there
is
just
a
lot
of
flavor
here
and
a
lot
going
on
very
much
a
fall
beer
everything
about
it
is
perfect
for
fall
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
definitely
try
this
one
i
am
ready
for
more
of
it
its
just
great
if
someone
were
to
ask
me
to
recommend
a
fall
seasonal
as
of
right
now
this
is
the
one
id
tell
them
about
overall
its
so
much
better
than
their
regular
beers
it
drinks
so
balanced
i
have
never
had
such
a
tasty
and
complex
pumpkin
beer
well
done
guys
gonna
try
to
put
some
away
for
thanksgiving
gonna
be
nice
with
turkey
day
dessert
and
as
a
night
capper
as
good
as
pumpkin
beer
can
be
schlafly
in
stl
has
got
a
lot
of
good
things
going
and
this
pumpkin
ale
is
one
of
them
great
flavor
hint
of
nutmeg
not
too
overpowering
with
fruit
flavor
as
some
other
beers
have
not
something
to
pound
rather
a
beer
to
relax
and
drink
12
of
while
enjoying
the
fall
scenery
fits
perfect
with
this
time
of
year
overall
a
really
really
solid
pumpkin
beer
how
they
all
should
be
not
too
sweet
and
a
great
spice
balance
the
reputation
for
this
beer
is
that
it
is
the
goldstandard
of
pumpkin
ales
for
the
most
part
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
the
color
is
a
nice
dark
amber
with
an
orange
hue
from
the
pumpkin
the
aroma
is
big
and
pleasant
the
taste
is
smooth
and
enjoyable
the
presence
of
nutmeg
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
but
that
is
the
only
complaint
i
could
throw
at
this
beer
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
and
one
of
the
best
in
my
opinion
ill
have
to
start
picking
this
up
every
fall
so
yes
id
recommend
for
sure
if
nothing
than
the
fact
that
its
8
abv
for
a
6pack
of
super
drinkable
pumpkin
brew
kudos
to
schlafly
on
this
one
id
love
to
give
a
rumbarrel
aged
version
a
try
poured
a
deep
dark
cloudy
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
aroma
of
nutmeg
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
with
sweet
malt
backbone
is
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
with
lightly
sweet
malt
backbone
all
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
with
sweetness
offsetting
some
of
the
spices
so
that
nothing
gets
out
of
hand
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
brewed
with
great
level
of
complexity
while
retaining
good
marks
for
drinkability
9
99
for
a
6pk
o
overall
a
really
well
balanced
pumpkin
beer
not
in
your
face
not
overly
sweet
just
a
super
solid
pumpkin
beer
that
being
said
if
you
dont
like
pumpkin
beer
you
probably
wont
like
this
but
if
you
are
going
to
try
any
pumpkin
beer
give
this
one
a
shot
the
more
i
drink
of
this
the
more
i
love
it
the
spice
flavor
is
leaving
my
mouth
with
a
tingle
and
a
slight
numbing
sensation
from
the
sheer
onslaught
of
spice
love
my
palate
is
giddy
with
cinnamon
glee
o
4
25
delicious
a
great
example
of
what
this
style
should
be
i
will
be
getting
more
of
this
for
the
fall
as
i
watch
my
beloved
indy
colts
this
fall
pours
tan
light
orange
into
glass
with
a
medium
head
instant
smell
of
pumpkin
pie
and
malt
as
you
pour
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
strong
with
pumpkin
crust
malt
with
a
medium
thickness
to
it
compared
to
other
pumpkin
beers
ive
bought
this
really
is
a
step
above
them
would
love
to
buy
this
again
the
perfect
beer
for
fall
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
pick
it
up
if
you
can
theres
a
bit
of
cola
flavor
that
im
not
a
fan
of
but
how
they
get
that
great
graham
cracker
note
in
there
ill
never
know
reminiscent
of
pumking
definitely
a
goto
seasonal
the
taste
is
unique
with
some
mild
red
grapelike
currant
and
cinnamon
mixed
with
subtle
bread
pudding
like
caramel
and
spice
combo
yet
the
malt
also
has
a
dry
toasted
brown
sugar
edge
with
some
mild
coriander
citrus
and
orange
peel
element
which
gives
a
very
autumnal
taste
interesting
in
ways
most
pumpkin
beers
dont
surprise
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
in
search
of
a
twist
on
the
traditional
pumpkin
ale
almost
like
mincemeat
with
that
spiced
fruity
flavor
yet
doesnt
sacrifice
the
flavor
of
an
actual
pumpkin
ale
either
it
is
exceptional
in
every
way
while
this
wasnt
as
strong
as
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
like
southern
tiers
pumpking
this
was
strong
enough
and
made
itself
known
somewhat
quickly
this
didnt
necessarily
win
me
over
to
the
point
where
i
had
to
rush
out
and
get
the
others
that
are
presently
flying
off
of
the
shelves
but
the
hype
is
real
and
if
you
love
fall
beers
get
your
hands
on
this
its
the
best
thats
out
there
and
bound
not
to
disappoint
even
if
you
dont
have
any
pumpkin
pie
on
hand
o
this
is
a
really
good
pumpkin
style
ale
far
above
some
of
the
others
ive
had
i
e
shipyard
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
really
seems
like
it
has
some
wasted
potential
3
im
considering
a
rereview
since
i
was
much
more
impressed
this
time
than
last
however
in
terms
of
numbers
i
still
think
this
is
overall
somewhere
in
the
3
94
1
range
overall
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
that
will
take
your
palate
to
the
thanksgiving
dinner
table
recommended
o
this
is
one
of
the
only
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
and
it
has
definitely
impressed
me
and
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
more
easily
the
best
ive
had
given
the
style
o
enjoyable
beer
better
than
most
veggie
pumpkin
style
beers
out
there
pours
a
dark
copper
color
12
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
strong
spices
cinnamon
all
spice
nutmeg
etc
sweet
malt
slight
alcohol
and
pumpkin
fits
the
style
of
a
pumpkin
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
spices
slight
alcohol
pumpkin
and
slight
sweet
malt
overall
good
appearance
strong
aroma
strong
body
and
blend
is
overtly
spicy
overall
great
spice
flavors
and
true
pumpkin
flavor
particularly
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
bit
sweet
for
my
liking
but
i
suppose
it
tastes
like
some
pumpkin
pie
for
sure
o
definitely
one
of
the
top
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tried
excited
to
try
a
few
more
o
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
i
still
think
it
tastes
a
lot
more
like
apple
pie
than
pumpkin
though
if
youre
a
fan
of
apple
pie
youll
really
like
it
if
youre
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
i
think
you
will
enjoy
it
too
one
notable
positive
attribute
of
this
beer
is
that
it
is
8
0
and
doesnt
have
a
strong
offensive
alcohol
flavor
o
honestly
i
cant
think
of
many
pumpkin
ales
better
than
this
id
even
go
so
far
as
to
saying
this
could
make
me
a
fan
of
the
style
and
im
blatantly
not
a
fan
of
the
style
bottle
poured
a
deep
dark
cloudy
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
aroma
of
nutmeg
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
with
sweet
malt
backbone
is
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
with
lightly
sweet
malt
backbone
all
flavours
are
very
well
balanced
with
sweetness
offsetting
some
of
the
spices
so
that
nothing
gets
out
of
hand
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
well
brewed
with
great
level
of
complexity
while
retaining
good
marks
for
drinkability
o
this
has
to
be
a
pumpkin
brew
all
can
enjoy
flavors
and
spices
and
potent
but
mellow
nothing
dramatic
with
any
one
flavor
it
is
certainly
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
this
pumpkin
brew
in
march
o
this
is
the
best
of
the
fake
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
it
doesnt
come
near
brews
made
with
real
pumpkin
the
cloying
sweetness
really
holds
it
back
the
heavy
spices
are
completely
necessary
to
cover
up
the
sweetness
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
but
wont
be
seeking
it
out
medium
body
with
a
strong
zesty
autumnal
spice
presence
that
dominates
up
frot
lingering
over
the
sweet
malts
before
a
sweet
pumpkin
piedessert
presence
shows
up
in
the
finish
peppery
with
ginger
clove
and
cinnamon
followed
by
caramel
malt
pumpkin
purée
vanilla
and
nutmeg
interesting
how
the
flavor
profile
changes
mid
palate
still
tons
of
spice
but
more
dessert
like
in
the
finish
only
a
subtle
vegetal
presnce
but
it
makes
it
a
bit
more
organic
tasting
than
a
pure
dessert
beer
nice
balance
of
both
approaches
to
the
style
decently
balanced
but
could
be
a
touch
sweeter
the
2013
version
of
this
brew
falls
slightly
short

the
beer
literally
smells
and
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
i
love
pumpkin
pie
it
is
pure
goodness
the
ladies
in
stl
at
least
love
this
beer
a
real
seasonal
crowd
pleaser
as
i
said
not
my
favorite
style
however
as
pumpkin
beers
go
this
one
might
be
my
new
favorite
i
cant
get
it
in
mn
so
thanks
to
shrode21
for
the
extra
copper
tinted
amber
in
color
creamy
offwhite
head
scent
brings
nice
balance
of
seasonal
spices
crusty
grains
and
pumpkin
with
touches
of
cream
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
taste
follows
suit
usually
one
for
the
sweeter
pumpkin
ales
that
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
as
opposed
to
over
spiced
ones
but
this
one
tastes
more
like
a
savory
pumpkin
dish
with
a
light
sweetness
medium
bodied
lightly
creamy
very
impressed
with
this
one
right
balance
of
all
ingredients
o
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
with
plenty
of
spices
malt
and
earthiness
kept
in
pretty
well
balance
tends
to
get
a
bit
sweet
on
the
finish
im
just
not
wowed
by
it
though
glad
to
have
slayed
this
want
of
mine
but
my
quest
for
the
perfect
pumpkin
beer
continues
o
one
of
the
best
of
its
style
ill
drink
a
few
of
these
each
fall
but
not
many
more
rather
have
an
ipa
o
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
ever
had
perhaps
even
the
best
a
contender
with
pumking
for
sure
but
at
the
same
time
its
very
different
pumking
is
sweeter
and
tastes
more
like
pumpkin
pie
right
down
to
the
graham
cracker
crust
and
the
whipped
cream
this
is
more
of
a
strict
pumpkin
ale
for
better
or
worse
great
flavors
and
well
balanced
wish
they
distributed
this
here
overall
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
so
far
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
pour
is
clear
brownish
red
with
a
light
tan
head
nose
is
spice
forward
nothing
overpowering
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
a
touch
of
cream
and
maybe
a
note
of
honey
taste
is
more
pumpkin
spice
forward
well
balanced
creamy
full
body
and
crisp
highly
carbonated
finish
overall
a
must
try
o
this
was
a
pretty
sweet
beer
with
very
apparent
pumpkin
spicesnotes
drink
it
on
the
warmer
side
shame
i
cant
get
this
stuff
in
so
cal
but
i
enjoyed
my
time
with
it
i
think
it
may
have
benefited
from
a
full
body
anyway
i
would
recommend
and
buy
savor
great
beer
poured
half
bottle
into
rocks
glass
nice
bourbon
color
not
much
of
a
head
and
the
head
completely
disappears
nice
spicy
malty
aroma
and
flavor
get
a
bit
of
a
pumpkin
flavor
with
maybe
a
bit
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
marynka
hops
malts
include
2row
and
crystal
malted
barley
munich
malt
wheat
malt
chocolate
malt
and
i
think
i
get
a
bit
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
i
get
a
bit
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
and
maybe
ginger
a
tad
bit
boozy
for
this
low
of
abv
but
it
fades
quickly
into
a
nice
dry
finish
pretty
watery
mouthfeel
over
all
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
match
to
any
thanksgiving
din
din
the
great
pumpkin
hasnt
arrived
but
this
is
a
good
brew
to
enjoy
while
you
await
his
or
her
arrival
ive
dumped
my
share
of
pumpkin
beers
and
truthfully
despite
wanting
to
enjoy
them
rarely
do
that
said
this
is
certainly
the
beer
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
to
date
and
one
that
id
likely
hazard
to
drink
again
nicely
done
schlafly
overall
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
out
there
very
well
balanced
and
not
sweet
at
all
i
could
honestly
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
one
to
pick
up
every
year
probably
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
though
its
not
a
style
i
particularly
seek
out
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
i
had
this
beer
2
times
in
a
bottle
at
churchkey
and
at
number
9
12
in
dc
this
beer
is
overwhelming
with
spices
like
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
all
spice
i
want
to
like
this
beer
but
i
just
cant
i
could
not
taste
much
pumpkin
since
the
spices
take
over
the
beer
i
definitely
did
not
taste
any
flavor
of
vanilla
i
prefer
some
vanilla
taste
with
my
pumpkin
beers
beer
pours
a
clear
copperbrown
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
phenonmenal
it
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
in
the
absolute
best
way
with
a
fantastic
mix
of
pumpkin
brown
sugar
and
spices
like
my
experience
with
most
pumpkin
beers
the
flavor
isnt
quite
as
good
as
the
smell
the
flavor
is
primarily
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
brown
sugar
and
the
pumpkin
flavor
itself
is
a
little
buried
in
the
mix
this
is
one
of
the
bettertasting
pumpkin
beers
out
there
in
that
it
avoids
being
too
sweet
but
still
brings
a
pretty
accurate
pumpkin
pie
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
maybe
a
little
on
the
thin
side
without
enough
carbonation
im
not
the
biggest
pumpkin
beer
fan
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
its
great
in
small
doses
but
i
dont
want
to
drink
more
than
one
in
any
sitting
o
if
its
a
liquid
dessert
youre
looking
for
look
no
further
than
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
it
might
as
well
be
liquified
pumpkin
pie
heavier
than
the
normal
pumpkin
beer
its
got
an
understated
kick
with
a
finish
that
pulls
you
right
back
in
this
is
one
fall
treat
that
is
not
to
be
missed
overall
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
really
drinkable
not
too
sweet
and
great
flavors
o
an
excellent
affordable
pumpkin
ale
stands
up
to
those
bombers
pretty
well
and
packs
plenty
of
flavor
to
just
keep
sipping
hands
down
the
best
pumpkin
ale
around
however
the
taste
is
very
very
sweet
its
like
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
the
downfall
is
that
its
nearly
impossible
to
find
because
liquor
stores
only
receive
1
case
per
store
here
due
to
its
limit
of
tanks
on
their
brewing
facility
the
nutmeg
and
spices
are
very
distinct
compared
to
any
other
oktoberfest
women
love
this
drink
as
well
schlafly
outdid
theirselves
on
this
1
of
kind
pumpkin
beer
wish
it
was
around
all
year
round
the
beer
was
really
good
i
likes
everything
about
it
except
im
trying
to
find
one
with
a
thicker
mouth
feel
this
has
been
my
first
review
if
you
have
the
time
please
let
me
know
how
it
is
and
what
if
anything
i
should
do
different
thanks
probably
the
best
pumpkin
beer
that
my
wife
and
i
have
found
it
was
a
nice
rich
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
smelled
heavily
of
pumpkin
and
a
subtle
spiciness
the
pumpkin
flavor
was
not
overpowering
but
definitely
let
you
know
you
had
a
pumpkin
beer
i
say
this
because
many
call
there
beers
pumpkin
x
but
very
few
achieve
the
taste
imo
this
beer
should
be
at
the
top
of
any
seasonal
pumpkin
lovers
list
overall
i
loved
the
nose
on
this
one
but
the
flavour
and
mouthfeel
were
rather
disappointing
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
i
am
still
searching
for
that
perfect
pumpkin
that
doesnt
overdo
it
on
the
spices
and
has
a
rich
thick
feel
this
one
comes
pretty
close
i
was
pleased
to
get
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
and
i
will
probably
seek
it
out
next
fall
excellent
mouthfeel
and
very
full
bodied
this
is
an
excellent
sweet
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
that
really
delivers
in
smell
taste
and
all
of
the
above
o
this
is
a
go
to
pumpkin
beer
i
had
heard
its
as
good
as
pumpking
but
i
dont
think
its
quite
there
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
i
shall
certainly
try
this
title
again
poured
out
as
a
really
nice
looking
clear
burnt
orange
color
the
head
was
white
but
it
came
and
went
rather
quickly
not
leaving
any
lacing
at
all
behind
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
really
nice
its
got
a
good
balance
of
sweet
malt
with
spice
notes
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
impressive
its
sweet
with
a
light
toasted
note
and
the
spices
come
in
and
make
this
beer
an
exceptional
autumn
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
its
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
not
too
bad
overall
its
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
o
this
is
my
leader
of
the
pack
so
far
awesome
beer
overall
im
spoiled
by
good
gourd
this
isnt
a
spice
bomb
but
it
still
doesnt
let
the
pumpkin
shine
the
way
i
want
i
do
appreciate
that
it
isnt
boozy
as
hell
like
good
gourd
though
o
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
well
hidden
making
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
there
are
very
good
flavors
of
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
are
well
balanced
definitely
a
great
example
for
the
style
and
one
i
will
have
again
overall
i
am
going
directly
to
the
store
and
picking
up
a
six
pack
of
this
for
thanksgiving
dinner
amazing
amazing
beer
if
you
like
pumpkin
pie
try
this
beer
overall
excellent
beer
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
compliments
the
cinnamon
pumpkin
and
butter
flavors
that
dominate
the
taste
my
only
complaint
is
theres
a
little
too
much
booze
taste
this
is
an
8
0
beer
and
it
shows
i
still
highly
recommend
it
for
anyone
who
loves
warm
comforting
fall
flavors
overall
outstanding
perhaps
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
this
may
be
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
out
there
smell
and
taste
are
great
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
very
nicely
made
if
i
could
get
this
more
easily
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
never
have
i
smelled
a
beer
and
been
taken
back
to
my
childhood
but
this
is
the
exception
my
mother
would
make
pumpkin
bread
at
this
time
of
the
year
but
one
whiff
of
schaflys
and
i
was
back
in
the
70s
the
label
states
it
is
brewed
with
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
clove
and
its
evident
in
scent
and
taste
solely
my
opinion
but
this
is
easily
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
tasted
the
biggest
draw
is
that
my
wife
has
now
decided
to
experiment
with
craft
brews
because
of
the
ale
overall
this
is
a
winner
im
happy
to
have
five
more
to
ring
in
my
favorite
season
a
great
ale
for
the
season
really
tasty
warming
fantastic
smelling
not
hugely
familiar
with
pumpkin
ales
but
i
definitely
like
this
one
oneed
to
do
a
blind
tasting
of
this
and
pumking
both
are
amazing
and
the
class
of
the
field
down
side
after
searching
for
this
beer
for
a
long
time
and
finally
tracking
it
down
this
year
i
was
hoping
that
like
thoreau
it
would
be
transcendental
it
was
not
quite
that
but
it
certainly
is
a
solid
effort
at
brewing
a
fall
classic
o
a
near
perfect
pumpkin
ale
for
me
its
between
this
and
alewerks
pumpkin
ale
for
the
best
in
the
land
schlafly
is
more
spice
forward
alewerks
is
more
malt
forward
both
are
delicious
the
disappointing
thing
however
is
that
my
distributor
tells
me
this
is
it
for
novadc
for
schlafly
pumpkin
for
the
rest
of
the
year
how
is
this
possible
hey
schlafly
people
actually
like
to
drink
pumpkin
ales
on
halloween
which
is
in
late
october
heck
a
lot
of
people
like
them
through
thanksgiving
disappointing
that
schlafly
has
caved
to
seasonal
creep
that
they
are
ceasing
their
pumpkin
in
late
september
but
whatever
ive
got
two
more
sixpacks
of
this
baby
and
they
will
be
enjoyed
through
the
fall
fantastic
beer
o
fantastic
beer
right
up
there
with
good
gourd
for
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
thanks
to
treebs
for
giving
me
this
one
as
an
extra
its
like
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
deep
amberred
in
body
with
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
film
over
top
sweet
aroma
of
pumpkin
sweets
cinnamon
carrot
cake
and
light
booze
in
the
background
light
flavors
of
pumpkin
treats
cinnamon
hazelnut
minor
grass
notes
light
booze
but
not
warming
too
light
in
body
for
the
flavors
here
and
light
carbonation
a
bit
too
watery
for
my
preference
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
well
blended
and
nice
take
on
the
style
the
spices
here
are
really
restrained
and
come
out
with
just
enough
character
to
solidify
it
in
the
style
the
touch
of
perfume
edge
that
creeps
out
distracts
just
a
bit
along
with
the
veggie
edge
that
keeps
this
from
being
perfect
in
my
opinion
overall
it
is
solid
and
absolutely
worth
a
try
overall
really
nice
pumpkin
beer
definately
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
that
i
have
drank
this
year
this
is
a
fantastic
chioce
for
a
fall
beer
taste
is
tangy
and
heavy
on
the
spice
this
is
very
malty
think
a
brown
ale
with
all
the
spice
and
pumpkin
touches
bringing
some
balance
to
the
sweetness
a
superlative
fall
seasonal
and
among
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
overall
definitely
a
good
pumpkin
beer
but
still
does
not
win
out
over
st
pumkin
and
chelsea
pumpkin
pie
overall
i
think
its
obvious
what
i
feel
about
this
beer
spectacular
i
enjoy
pumking
when
i
want
an
overpowering
pumpkin
beer
but
this
one
is
just
the
best
well
rounded
pumpkin
ale
ever
you
know
youre
drinking
a
beer
but
spiced
up
pumpkin
style
awesome
ale
overall
as
ready
as
i
was
for
a
good
seasonal
ale
i
was
still
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
selection
the
brewer
has
done
an
excellent
job
bringing
out
robust
pumpkin
flavor
without
crafting
something
overpowering
or
too
bitter
im
glad
i
purchased
this
in
a
6pack
and
might
well
be
back
for
more
wow
what
a
great
pumpkin
ale
the
overall
appearance
is
a
toasted
orange
color
with
about
an
12
head
smelled
of
pumpkin
spice
and
nutmeg
with
maybe
a
hint
of
all
spice
the
flavor
was
perfect
not
artificial
tasting
like
some
other
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
it
was
delicately
balanced
for
a
robust
and
very
enjoyable
beer

like
this

it
wasnt

cold

i
had
it

and
humid
so
it
might
of
detracted
from
my
experience
i
do
like
this
beer
but
wish
there
was
a
stronger
pumpkin
presence
i
know
that
early
february
isnt
the
most
opportune
time
to
be
drinking
a
pumpkin
ale
but
i
figured
that
an
8

would
hold
up
well
being
holed
up
for
a
few
months
and
it

pumpkin

drinkability
is

this

is

a

a
nice
golden
orange
colored
body
with
a
head
that
didnt
stick
around
very
long
the
usual
smell
that
is
associated
with
brews
of
this
nature
except
more
profound
the
spices
made
more
of
a
statement
than
most
really
setting
the
tone
for
what
was
to
come
the
flavor
was
fairly
bold
for
a
pumpkin
ale
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
were
present
but
the
meat
of
the
pumpkin
was
there
at
the
forefront
followed
by
a
taste
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
which
lingered
on
the
tongue
for
awhile
medium
mouthfeel
and
drinkable
but
i
couldnt
handle
more
than
two
in
a
night
i
would
drink
again
if
i
come
across
it
i
love
pumpkin
ales
so
i
was
hoping
that
schlafly
wouldnt
dissapoint
they
didnt
poured
from
a
special
release
bottle
into
a
glass
with
a
nice
head
and
a
beautiful
pumpkin
color
that
just
lets
you
know
the
best
is
yet
to
come
the
smell
was
well
pumpkin
pie
with
aromas
that
captured
the
smell
of
a
fresh
baked
pumpkin
pie
like
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
wow
the
tatse
was
definately
like
a
liquified
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
i
would
definately
reccomend
this
as
one
to
try
too
bad
this
is
only
around
for
a
short
time
this
is
slightly
sweet
and
really
does
make
for
a
decent
desert
option
easy
enough
to
drink
as
an
after
dinner
beer
but
not
by
any
means
a
session
beer
final
note
oh

clear

spice

nutmeg
takes
the
lead
taste
is
immediately
dry
and
spicy
a
bit
overdone
on
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
alcohol
presence
is
readily
noticeable
medium
body
ginger
makes
an
appearance
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
more
cinnamon
maybe
its
still
to
warm
for
this
one
i
wasnt
ready
for
the
alcohol
warming
just
yet
still
an
ok
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
thanks
hop
this
beer
would
be
perfect
right
after
thanksgiving
dinner
at
8
though
it
would
definitely
be
naptime
i
could
see
myself
drinking
2
of
these
probably
not
more
than
that
though
the
mouthfeel
is

the

this

is

at
a
constant
pace
to
a
thin
skim
coat
with
a
short
collar
and
leaving
no
lacing
a
single
jetting
carbonation
stream
rises
aromas
of
liquefied
pumpkin
pie
abound
cinnamon
nutmeg
a
touch
of
cloves
and
a
bit
of
crust
malt
the
label
reads
that
ginger
is
included
and
there
perhaps
just
a
hint
of
its
zing
up
front
is
some
malt
that
is
reminiscent
of
baked
crust
followed
by
rich
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
a
warming
alcohol
note
it
is
almost
as
if
i
am
eating
a
piece
of
pie
backwards
starting
with
the
crust
and
ending
with
the
point
the
best
part
the
finish
is
cinnamon
and
a
touch
of
spicy
ginger
this
is
a
nice
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
a
warming
alcohol
edge
smooth
rich
and
creamy
like
a
piece
of
homemade
pie
nice
overall
and
definitely
on
the
maltierricher
side
balanced
with
plenty
of
spices
schlafly
did
this
one
right
and
for
right
now
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
poured
by
one
of
my
st
louis
brews
buddies
at
8th
annual
hop
in
the
city
fest
i
was
given
a
generous
portion
very
nice
appearance
the
second
sample
of
the
fest
that
followed
a
randalized
apa
rolled
out
by
brewmaster
stephen
hale
following
the
five
pound
blast
of
cascades
that
the
apa
filtered
through
the
pumpkin
spice
flavors
seen
quite
tame
but
the
underlying
malt
flavors
carbonation
and
finish
were
satisfying
after
a
little
rinse
to
clear
the
palate
the
flavor
of
pumkin
came
through
better
i
found
the
spicing
a
little
over
done
for
me
the
test
of
this
style
is
how
well
it
holds
up
over
the
entire
bottle
i
had
the
ofallon
last
week
and
found
it
a
beats
schlafly
this
year
but
both
are
well
above
average
i
had
this
on
tap
at
lunch
yesterday
but
this
first
review
is
for
the
bottled
version
dark
copper
to
amber
color
very
clear
and
topped
by
a
fizzy
off
white
head
the
head
dissipated
quickly
this
beer
is
about
8
abv
so
im
not
surprised
the
head
recedes
quickly
wow
great
pumpkin
pie
smell
loads
of
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
whats
that
pumpkin
it
really
comes
across
in
the
nose
nice
malty
backbone
too
the
room
fills
with
the
aroma
the
flavor
dances
in
your
mouth
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
comes
first
but
the
pumpkin
shines
through
what
is
a
pumpkin
ale
without
a
nice
ale
base
and
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
wonderful
dark
caramel
malt
finish
the
pumpkin
and
spice
character
lingers
long
after
the
drink
blending
nicely
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
big
full
mouth
feel
great
drinkability
this
beer
really
is
nice
and
shines
up
there
with
other
great
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
from
watch
city
and
smuttynose
the
nutmeg
is
strong
with
this
one
ok
but
you
know
how
it
is
with
pumpkin
ales
among
my
favorite
fall
beers
to
drink
they
didnt
overkill
the
beer
with
pumpkin
flavor
making
it
excellent
chocolate
porter
with
pumpkin
spices
not
my
favorite
styles
of
ale
but
is
a
delicious
ale
i
generally
dont
like
the
feel
of
pumpkin
beers
because
they
are
a
bit
too
sticky
for
me
however
despite
that
punkin
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
with
clear
pumpkin
without
overwhelming
pumpkin
spice
some
pumpkin
beers
are
too
sweet
this
doesnt
overdo
it
older
varieties
were
much
tastier
the
current
seasonal
that
is
being
put
out
is
still
good
but
no
where
near
as
good
as
it
was
when
dfh
really
kicked
off
distribution
decent
pumpkin
ale
pours
well
medium
orangy
amber
colorat
least
to
me
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
i
dont
like
pumpkin
beers
overall
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
great
balance
between
the
traditional
maltyhoppy
flavors
of
beer
balanced
well
with
the
pumpkin
and
spices
in
years
past
this
has
been
my
favorite
but
ive
since
had
some
excellent
pumpkin
beers
this
season
that
have
moved
dogfish
heads
punk
down
on
my
list
of
favorites
that
being
said
this
beer
will
always
have
a
place
on
my
shelf
in
the
autumn
pumpkin
beers
seem
to
have
lovers
and
haters
with
not
much
in
between
personally
i
love
them
so
long
as
they
are
not
too
pumpkiny
this
ale
fits
the
bill
though
the
2014
version
is
not
quite
as
good
as
prior
vintages
the
head
and
lace
are
lacking
in
the
latest
vintage
and
this
effects
the
mouthfeel
which
seems
dry
otherwise
a
really
nice
spiciness
and
flavor
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
i
dont
think
this
one
will
disappoint
v
medium
value
came
in
a
four
pack
of
bottles
best
pumpkin
beer
out
thee
yes
better
than
pumking
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
fallpumpkin
beer
this
is
my
first
of
the
season
so
maybe
my
thoughts
will
be
different
after
i
have
tried
some
other
similar
beers
a
personal
favorite
out
of
the
pumpkin
category
somewhat
boozey
good
carbonation
nice
aroma
pumpkin
spice
is
perfect
not
too
sweet
i
really
enjoyed
this
ale
not
going
to
be
very
descriptive
great
pumpkin
flavor
can
taste
all
the
spices
too
hmmm
a
full
bodied
brown
ale
not
so
sure
about
that
despite
the
misleading
description
it
has
a
remarkably
pleasant
appearance
it
is
jubilantly
orange
with
an
inviting
glow
when
it
catches
the
light
in
fact
the
playful
and
vibrant
orange
color
is
the
attribute
i
enjoyed
the
most
about
this
beer
not
far
behind
is
the
aroma
the
spices
and
pumpkin
meat
meld
in
to
an
alluring
symphony
my
wife
declared
that
it
is
mouthwatering
shes
not
even
a
big
beer
drinker
as
for
the
taste
this
is
a
little
bit
on
the
cloying
side
with
an
initial
sugary
sweetness
followed
by
a
harsh
spicing
regimen
that
sticks
to
the
palate
and
never
quite
meshes
coherently
the
phenolic
clove
characteristics
seem
to
override
the
malt
presence
and
compete
with
a
boozy
fusel
alcohol
that
rides
through
the
whole
experience
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
struggling
to
come
through
as
are
the
bready
malts
but
they
get
whacked
in
to
submission
by
the
booze
and
spice
although
not
offensive
its
simply
not
the
besttasting
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
not
by
a
long
shot
that
said
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
creamy
perfectly
carbonated
with
medium
viscosity
overall
this
is
a
decent
representation
i
wonder
if
this
beer
would
age
well
perhaps
mellowing
some
of
the
sharper
edges
with
the
spice
and
alcohol
perhaps
this
one
would
be
better
with
a
slightly
lower
abv
its
rare
that
i
would
suggest
going
smaller
but
in
this
case
i
feel
like
the
higher
gravity
detracts
from
the
beer
as
with
most
quality
brews
as
it
warmed
and
through
the
middle
of
the
glass
the
flavor
profiles
came
together
a
bit
more
worth
a
try
for
sure
especially
if
you
like
palatewrecking
spiced
beers
a
tad
overrated
in
my
humble
opinion
if
you
want
a
big
pumpkin
beer
try
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
of
course
theres
always
pumking
for
the
overthetop
pumpkin
experience
personally
i
recommend
smuttynose
if
you
can
get
it
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
o
not
too
sweet
and
a
good
reminder
what
good
pumpkin
beer
should
be
like
mid
pack
pumpkin
beer
o
definitely
one
of
the
best
beerpie
hybrids
brought
enough
of
that
hedonistic
pumpkinspice
theme
while
still
providing
real
beer
character
that
wet
dog
flavor
was
a
major
setback
but
most
everything
else
was
spot
on
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
more
porterish
in
style
as
is
this
is
much
more
a
straight
shooter
pumpkin
ale
with
a
moderately
caramel
malt
body
dogfish
did
a
good
job
of
keeping
this
in
balance
its
one
of
the
more
pleasing
and
balanced
pumpkin
ales
that
actually
carries
a
solid
pumpkin
profile
albeit
with
a
good
dose
of
spice
well
recommended
and
this
was
quite
satisfying
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
in
this
style
but
doesnt
quite
match
the
quality
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
although
i
do
think
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
before
getting
overwhelmed
by
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
like
many
of
the
pumpkin
beers
around
p
s
i
had
it
today
again
and
did
not
notice
the
metallic
aroma
maybe
it
was
the
glass
or
maybe
i
was
previously
detecting
detergent
from
the
wash
nevertheless
this
time
i
detected
a
nice
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
aroma
i
raised
the
score
on
the
aroma
on
sight
dogfish
head
punkin
ale
pours
clear
pale
gold
hinting
toward
a
caramelish
brown
the
scent
it
gives
off
is
comprised
of
brown
sugar
slightly
caramelized
with
hints
of
vanilla
allspice
and
cinnamon
the
smell
is
vaguely
creamy
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
on
the
palate
it
starts
off
slightly
sweet
with
a
moderate
mouth
feel
and
a
delicate
carbonization
flavor
wise
its
full
of
brown
sugar
light
caramelization
cinnamon
allspice
and
a
touch
of
nutmeg
the
pumpkin
element
is
subdued
but
still
present
in
a
distinctly
squashy
kind
of
way
it
finishes
on
the
spicier
side
with
touches
of
butter
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
never
can
go
wrong
with
dogfish
head
definitely
the
best
punkin
ale
out
there
the
only
downside
is
how
fast
it
flies
off
the
shelves
grab
it
while
you
can
and
as
much
as
you
can
regardless
of
the
label
this
beer
showed
no
flavors
of
pumpkin
brown
sugar
allspice
cinnamon
or
nutmeg
the
color
was
the
only
thing
i
liked
about
this
ale
light
brown
not
as
heavy
on
the
pumpkin
as
i
expected
not
bad
easily
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
tried
thus
far
an
excellent
all
round
offering
that
falls
short
of
being
a
classic
but
is
very
drinkable
starting
off
quite
spicy
i
was
initially
fearful
that
this
one
would
end
up
like
some
other
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
namely
pumpkinhead
from
brewdog
but
thankfully
this
one
was
a
lot
more
balanced
enjoyable
definitely
one
id
pick
up
each
year
if
it
were
available
here
in
the
uk
i
feel
like
this
is
solid
if
not
particularly
gourdbreaking
i
actually
prefer
having
a
softer
sweeter
base
as
i
dont
have
a
particularly
strong
affinity
for
the
sharper
maltsamber
base
that
a
lot
of
pumpkins
seems
to
use
thats
just
me
though
overall
for
me
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
all
around
i
have
very
little
bad
to
say
about
it
other
than
that
i
almost
wonder
if
the
name
should
be
more
like
an
autumn
beer
o
a
good
example
of
a
not
so
great
style
serving
type
bottle
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
not
too
crazy
sweet
your
girlfriends
favorite
beer
very
faint
pumpkin
taste
and
seemed
very
watered
down
i
prefer
very
strong
pumpkin
flavor
so
this
one
just
wasnt
for
me
a
good
start
to
an
unpleasant
finish
left
slightly
disappointed
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
o
solid
pumpkin
ale
by
dogfish
head
would
get
it
again
im
not
going
to
do
an
indepth
review
i
had
this
beer
chill
for
a
little
and
it
was
a
lot
more
enjoyable
definitely
a
winteryfeel
to
it
more
spice
than
pumpkin
smooth
as
ever
though
this
deserves
to
be
enjoyed
overall
balanced
and
easy
drinking
goes
great
with
homemade
pumpkin
pie
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
may
be
the
point
of
this
pumpkin
ale
to
be
a
session
beer
that
goes
down
easy
and
in
turn
multiples
can
be
enjoyed
its
also
a
beer
that
most
people
can
appreciate
including
nonbeer
lovers
very
broad
in
its
approach
again
this
is
not
nearly
as
bold
as
i
thought
it
might
be
sam
usually
likes
to
push
the
envelope
with
his
beers
but
this
one
holds
back
still
nicely
balanced
and
nothing
to
complain
about
however
i
would
have
to
be
honest
and
say
it
is
a
slight
disappointment
for
me
personally
given
that
it
doesnt
differ
too
much
when
comparing
it
to
other
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
brooklyn
brewerys
post
road
is
not
far
off
from
this
and
is
more
widely
available
this
is
still
a
great
beer
im
not
sure
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
get
around
to
trying
punkin
ale
its
a
very
approachable
pumpkin
beer
not
too
spiced
and
not
overly
boozey
it
might
not
be
my
favorite
pumpkin
brew
but
it
is
very
well
rounded
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
the
flavor
of
pumpkin
is
there
but
not
too
strong
the
spices
are
aromatic
but
not
artificial
on
the
tongue
its
a
nice
solid
beer
with
some
pumpkin
added
for
flavor
not
a
pumpkin
with
beer
as
an
afterthought
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
i
have
been
on
the
hunt
for
the
best
tasting
one
and
this
is
right
up
there
has
good
pumpkin
flavor
not
overpowering
and
not
as
sweet
as
some
of
the
others
i
have
tasted
this
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
in
my
opinion
the
spices
are
very
well
blended
for
a
delicious
tasting
beer
best
of
luck
finding
this
gem
this
late
in
the
season
although
i
did
find
a
place
earlier
today
that
still
had
several
cases
available
needless
to
say
i
bought
one
happy
drinking
everyone
overall
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
good
mix
of
pumpkin
flavor
with
spices
and
toasty
malt
notes
tastes
like
double
crooked
tree
with
a
hint
of
pumkin
and
spice
overall
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
but
quickly
found
myself
underwhelmed
by
its
sugary
flavor
profile
as
far
as
craft
pumpkin
ales
go
its
middle
of
the
pack
and
this
4pack
will
likely
be
my
first
and
last
go
of
it
transparent
copper
colored
ale
nice
head
with
solid
retention
malty
biscuit
aroma
with
added
spices
mild
bready
malt
backbone
subtle
butter
flavor
hint
of
pumpkin
assertive
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spices
mild
hop
medium
bodied
descent
carbonation
finish
is
a
little
off
balanced
from
the
spices
eh
its
ok
deep
ambercopper
color
with
small
off
white
head
aromas
of
caramel
pie
spice
earth
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
sweet
brown
sugary
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
pie
spices
a
subtle
and
balance
the
sweetness
quite
nicely
medium
body
with
light
to
moderate
carbonation
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beer
but
i
could
drink
this
one
its
a
shame
it
took
me
so
long
to
taste
this
one
surprisingly
subtle
for
a
dogfish
head
beer
for
better
or
worse
a
lot
of
their
beers
are
out
of
the
ordinary
this
was
one
essentially
a
brown
ale
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
pumpkin
taste
dh
punkin
instead
offers
a
great
fizzy
carbonation
to
keep
the
heavy
mouthfeel
and
starchy
sweetness
in
check
o
very
pleased
with
this
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
tamed
and
leaves
the
palate
satisfied
pours
a
nice
brown
good
taste
all
around
i
dont
really
get
any
pumpkin
here
i
dont
really
mind
it
catch
a
little
bit
on
the
back
end
the
spices
are
great
it
is
more
just
a
good
all
around
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
enjoyed
from
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
i
think
dogfish
head
got
this
punkin
ale
right
it
is
a
great
brown
ale
with
just
the
right
amount
of
pumpkin
and
spices
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
not
overdone
and
the
brown
sugar
and
spices
add
a
nice
touch
as
you
sip
this
beer
i
have
been
nursing
the
4pack
for
a
week
now
overall
an
exceptional
pumpkin
ale
alcohol
is
well
hidden
some
brown
sugar
in
the
finish
3
755
overall
this
one
has
a
few
things
that
keeps
it
in
the
3s
for
me
but
it
also
has
some
good
qualities
that
i
like
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
on
down
the
road
it
has
all
those
pumpkin
notes
with
a
lil
bit
of
astringency
but
the
raul
man
needs
a
lil
more
boom
boom
in
the
zoom
zoom
o
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
its
fairly
straightforward
but
i
enjoy
that
the
focus
is
on
the
actual
pumpkin
flavors
theres
no
pie
crustspicy
feel
to
this
really
its
sweet
and
pumpkiny
one
of
many
joys
regarding
fall
this
beer
is
a
fall
classic
on
the
pumpkin
beer
spectrum
that
ranges
from
pumpkin
pie
to
gourd
in
flavor
punkin
is
certainly
more
toward
the
gourd
side
it
is
very
subtle
especially
compared
to
other
popular
pumpkin
beers
like
souther
tier
this
allows
the
beer
to
be
totally
sessionable
while
still
giving
some
of
the
spicy
fall
notes
people
look
for
in
pumpkin
beers
punkin
pours
a
beautiful
golden
amber
color
with
a
wispy
foamy
head
it
is
also
quite
clear
overall
i
like
this
beer
if
you
dont
like
cloves
i
wouldnt
go
for
this
though
im
not
normally
into
pumpkin
beer
but
this
was
great
overall
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
to
this
but
in
the
end
it
is
still
quite
good
id
recommend
a
try
anyway
best
pumpkin
beer
period
overall
super
nice
if
not
particularly
surprising
did
not
disappoint
f
like
in
the
nose
its
pretty
much
spices
so
overall
not
as
interesting
nutmeg
cinnamon
cloves
up
front
sweet
base
malt
intersperses
in
there
giving
it
sort
of
a
pie
crust
breadiness
kind
of
nice
actually
the
alcohol
booze
is
stronger
on
the
palate
especially
on
the
backend
which
i
suppose
makes
for
a
sort
of
a
solid
digestif

good
pumkin
ale
spice
and
pumkin
not
over
bearing
good
clean
taste
very
nice
for
a
pumpkin
beer
overall
dogfish
punkin
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
do
appreciate
that
i
can
detect
a
lot
more
actual
pumpkin
flavor
and
aroma
than
in
most
others
but
i
would
appreciate
a
little
more
sweet
and
spice
im
sure
many
people
out
there
may
prefer
this
however
overall
as
the
label
says
this
really
is
a
perfect
beer
to
warm
up
with
spices
are
front
and
center
so
fortunately
they
are
excellently
blended
and
really
match
up
with
the
platonic
idea
of
pumpkin
pie
i
would
love
to
have
this
with
a
little
vanilla
ice
cream
or
just
whipped
cream
on
the
side
mouthfeel
light
medium
to
medium
in
body
with
medium
to
medium
high
carbonation
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
a
refreshing
fruit
beer
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
on
the
high
side
but
still
very
nice
overall
it
is
a
nice
seasonal
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
dogfish
head
i
wish
it
had
a
stronger
pumpkin
flavor
but
overall
its
a
winner
and
with
an
abv
of
7
its
a
nice
sipper
that
will
get
you
were
you
want
to
go
nutmeg
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
light
brown
sugar
fill
the
nose
a
quick
whiff
smells
like
a
cane
sugar
ginger
ale
soda
not
much
pumpkin
in
the
taste
although
it
does
give
it
some
chewiness
in
the
mouthfeel
would
make
a
tasty
thanksgiving
dessert
option
along
side
pumpkin
pie
with
fresh
whipped
cream
o
i
really
like
this
seasonal
beer
i
feel
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
brigade
the
gap
from
pumpkin
ale
season
to
christmas
ale
season
its
a
big
flavorful
beer
clear
amber
pour
with
a
onefinger
white
head
nice
aroma
of
spices
with
nutmeg
standing
out
great
flavor
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
light
pumpkin
slightly
sweet
flavor
that
has
a
tough
of
brown
sugar
as
beer
warms
more
of
an
overall
pumpkin
pie
flavor
comes
out

pumpkin
flavored
beer
is
not
my
favorite
that
being
said
everything
about
this
pumpkin
ale
is
excellent
less
the
taste
because
of
the
basic
spice
profile
for
me
if
you
like
pumpkin
flavored
beer
get
this
beer
taste
this
is
a
complex
beer
with
none
of
the
spices
overpowering
the
pumpkin
which
makes
me
happy
after
having
so
many
pumpkin
ales
that
dont
get
that
balance
right
with
plenty
of
taste
character
and
subtlety
punkin
ale
remains
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
and
one
id
return
to
again
only
negative
is
the
price
i
paid
13
99
for
a
4pk
im
new
to
the
pumpkin
beers
but
this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
one
yet
southern
tier
makes
a
good
pumkin
brew
but
still
like
the
dogfish
plan
on
trying
more
while
they
are
in
season
funny
thing
is
i
have
never
liked
pumpkin
pie
which
is
why
i
had
no
interest
in
pumpkin
beers
but
i
finally
tried
one
and
instantly
fell
in
love
tastes
more
like
the
smell
of
pumpkin
pie
then
the
taste
of
one
tasty
brew
color
of
clear
amber
with
a
offwhite
head
that
disappears
quickly
aroma
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
vanilla
and
other
spices
as
far
as
taste
the
first
thing
that
hits
you
is
the
carbonation
followed
by
the
flavors
of
a
pumpkin
pie
with
a
nice
malt
finish
at
the
back
end
easy
refreshing
drink
for
the
fall
i
recommend
enjoying
this
beer
while
watching
your
favorite
football
team
last
years
batch
2013
was
better
than
this
years
batch
that
being
said
not
sure
what
happened
still
a
great
beer
its
more
of
a
spice
beer
than
a
raw
pumpkin
flavor
upfront
you
get
the
usual
cinnamon
nutmeg
allspice
and
a
hint
of
some
pumpkin
for
7
you
cant
really
taste
the
alcohol
content
best
served
a
little
bit
on
the
warmer
side
to
get
the
full
flavors
and
aromas
to
pop
not
a
real
heavy
beer
great
for
any
fall
day
and
even
winter
not
much
head
on
this
beer
more
like
a
half
a
finger
then
some
lacing
afterwards
pours
dark
amber
this
pours
a
semiclear
amber
color
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
pumpkin
clove
and
spices
the
flavor
is
rich
with
pumpkin
and
spices
the
texture
is
perfect
for
the
style
but
the
flavors
could
be
a
little
bolder
overall
this
is
a
top
notch
pumpkin
beer
that
is
probably
one
of
the
top10
in
the
market
forge
pub
draft

overall
a
suberb
pumpkin
ale
maybe
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
to
the
point
that
it
would
detract
the
fresh
taste
is
there
not
too
spicey
either
but
enough
spice
taste
to
be
appropriate
definitely
lives

pumpkin

got
the

edition
seasonal
art

bottle
looks
as
good
as
it
tastes
not
the
greatest
pumpkin

but
definitely
worth
a
try
o
pleasantly
drinkable
for

abv
as
the

and

notes
mask

what
is
particularly
nice
about
this
beer
is
how
seamlessly
it
transitions
from
sweet
to
spicy
to
pumpkin
pie
to
a
malty
graham
cracker
finish
quite
a
tasty
pumpkin
ale
and
one
of
the
benchmarks
of
the
style
for
sure
i
generally
thought
i
hated
pumpkin
beers
but
every
year
i
try
to
find
a
beer
to
change
my
mind
i
dont
love
this
beer
but
it
is
definitely
getting
me
closer
to
liking
them
this
beer
pours
a
very
nice
orangegoldish
color
you
can
definitely
smell
the
pumpkin
with
various
spices
hitting
you
also
the
spices
like
cinnamon
and
all
spice
takes
the
lead
as
far
as
taste
and
mellows
into
a
nice
aftertaste
it
also
has
a
very
dense
mouth
feel
to
it
this
makes
me
want
to
explore
more
pumpkin
beers
pours

theres

and

and
while
it

the

develops
some

brown

and
a
light

quality
thin

alcohol
is
on

and
a
harsher
finish
that
i
would
have
liked
im
not
much
for
pumpkin
anything
i
think
its
overhyped
however
i
still
try
everything
i
can
get
my
hands
on
the
lacing
out
of
the
bottle
was
minimal
and
the
head
was
14
in
at
the
peak
it
was
light
mouthfeel
and
the
pumpkin
and
spices
were
secondary
to
the
brown
ale
aspect
which
was
nice
i
wont
buy
again
unless
im
forced
to
buy
anything
pumpkin
then
its
at
the
top
of
the
list
1st
review
as
a
brown
ale
its
successful
as
a
pumpkin
ale
its
middle
of
the
road
the
spices
and
overall
pumpkin
flavor
are
just
too
subtle
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
delicious
while
it
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
it
just
falls
short
when
compared
to
some
other
pumpkin
beers
out
there
overall
i
think
12
for
the
4pack
of
this
is
pretty
unwarranted
for
what
you
get
and
youd
be
better
off
getting
a
six
of
a
number
of
pumpkins
that
i
would
consider
better
or
get
a
six
of
dfh
indian
brown
i
think
this
ale
relies
heavily
on
abv
and
the
dfh
name
and
doesnt
really
stand
out
so
much
in
the
lineup
of
pumpkin
ales
this
is
just
a
standard
pumpkin
ale
to
me
with
more
alcohol
lacks
the
complexity
or
distinction
that
would
land
it
in
a
12
4pack
cheers
in
general
though
the
pumpkin
ales
never
seem
to
be
that
perfect
blend
of
pumpkin
and
spice
dark
orange
copper
color
thin
white
head
fades
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
pumpkin
pie
spices
are
subdued
nutmeg
cinnamon
cloves
and
vegetal
pumpkin
notes
taste
brings
more
of
that
vegetal
pumpkin
flavors
others
shy
away
from
caramel
like
malt
plays
host
to
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
clove
seems
like
two
parts
with
one
carrying
great
vegetal
pumpkin
then
sweet
malt
and
spices
but
it
never
comes
together
sharper
on
the
mouthfeel
than
id
like
here
higher
carbonation
and
slightly
thinner
end
of
medium
mouthfeel
overall
its
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
not
the
best
but
i
enjoy
a
couple
every
year
o
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
to
date
very
rich
flavors
that
blend
excellently
together
and
are
greatly
complimented
by
the
smell
and
creaminess
in
the
mouth
feel
found
a
bottle
2013
vintage
i
think
and
bought
it
immediately
i
love
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
coffee
colored
head
the
smell
is
full
of
pumpkin
and
spice
the
taste
was
very
delicious
with
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
up
front
and
then
sweet
pumpkin
flavor
in
the
finish
an
amazing
beer
for
pumpkin
lovers
one
of
my
favorites
very
tasty
this
year
like
very
few
pumpkin
style
beers
this
one
retains
its
quality
as
a
beer
all
awhile
bringing
on
that
smooth
pumpkin
flavor
no
pumpkin
pie
here
either
this

still
nicely

and

overall
o
not
bad
they
sold
out
both
kegs
in

hour
o
im
not
big
into
pumpkin
or
spiced
beers
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
probably
one
of
the
first
pumpkin
beers
that
i
decided
to
try
and
a
long
time
coming
to
write
the
review
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
beer
really
reminds
me
of
pumpkin
pie
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
full
head
developed
with
good
retention
and
lacing
appearance
was
a
clear
maybe
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
color
aroma
had
notes
of
spice
and
hop
with
some
floral
characters
taste
had
a
strong
spice
character
nutmeg
and
some
cinnamon
with
some
toffee
and
hop
notes
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
full
with
some
creamy
characteristics
aftertaste
was
dry
with
some
lingering
spice
effects
poured
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
very
festive
orange
coppery
color
i
dont
get
much
of
a
smell
off
of
this
one
taste
is
immediately
very
autumnrefreshing
sweetness
with
a
good
dose
of
the
alcohol
taste
of
the
7
coming
through
the
pumpkin
flavor
hits
midway
through
the
taste
and
not
overpowering
or
chemically
not
many
pumpkin
beers
the
pumpkin
lingers
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
its
good
not
great
overall
really
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
to
date
although
that
isnt
saying
much
since
im
hardly
a
pumpkin
ale
fan
impressed
by
the
wellblended
mix
of
nostalgic
spices
and
the
actual
presence
of
pumpkin
flavors
however
i
do
feel
there
is
some
room
for
improvement
as
tasty
as
those
spices
are
their
large
presence
makes
thigs
a
bit
unbalanced
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
yet
i
wasnt
super
impressed
by
it
but
i
will
probably
buy
this
again
next
year
at
issue
is
whether
or
not
my
unpleasant
experience
is
stylecentric
or
productcentric
nevertheless
based
upon
this
experience
i
will
not
be
tasting
any
pumpkinstyled
seasonal
beers
for
a
long
time
perhaps
i
can
exchange
the
unopened
bottles
for
some
strong
ipas
or
hopcentric
pilsners
let
me
start
this
off
by
saying
im
a
huge
pumpkin
beer
fan
thats
the
style
of
beer
that
originally
got
me
interested
in
anything
other
than
piss
water
coors
bud
miller
etc
after
college
im
not
sure
why
people
seem
to
like
this
so
much
there
are
a
lot
of
other
better
pumpkins
out
there
that
most
people
have
access
to
all
in
all
id
say
its
slightly
above
average
but
only
because
there
are
so
many
breweries
out
that
make
a
shitty
pumpkin
beer
only
trying
to
cash
in
on
the
style
its
worth
trying
but
for
the
amount
youre
spending
on
a
4pack
of
this
id
go
for
a
different
pumpkin
depending
on
what
you
have
access
to
overall
i
am
very
disappointed
in
myself
for
giving
this
brew
the
rating
i
have
i
love
dfhb
i
love
the
lengths
they
go
for
their
consumers
and
for
their
own
quality
of
product
however
this
was
unpleasant
at
times
i
understand
what
they
went
for
here
but
a
pumpkin
is
a
squash
and
i
know
they
are
very
floral
when
opened
but
if
you
bite
into
a
pumpkin
it
is
very
watery
little
to
no
flavor
i
can
see
the
purpose
of
the
brown
sugar
but
i
would
have
liked
to
have
tasted
more
of
a
sweetness
throughout
the
beer
this
was
completely
unbalanced
all
in
all
i
will
not
be
having
this
again
this
beer
needs
to
figure
out
what
the
hell
its
aiming
for
a
good
oncethrough
brew
but
overall
not
overwhelmingly
good
enough
to
make
me
want
to
buy
more
if
you
like
a
dry
quaff
though
this
might
hit
the
spot
o
a
smooth
beer
but
overall
rather
minimal
in
what
it
is
offering
although
subdued
pumpkins
beer
are
good
every
now
and
again
i
am
a
bigger
fan
of
the
spicy
pielike
styles
this
one
takes
it
to
the
extreme
good
for
someone
not
huge
on
pumpkin
ale
but
too
light
for
my
taste
cant
imagine
someone
disliking
it
but
cant
see
someone
having
it
as
their
first
choice
o
a
fantastic
big
fall
beer
its
not
really
the
best
if
you
are
looking
for
a
heavy
pumpkin
ale
experience
the
flavors
are
subtle
but
very
good
spices
stand
out
on
their
own
without
muddying
the
entire
experience
overall
this
is
an
awesome
pumpkin
brew
i
enjoy
how
playful
this
beer
is
i
get
nostalgic
for
moms
kitchen
because
it
could
almost
be
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
huge
props
to
dogfish
head
for
their
seasonal
heavy
hitter
you
cannot
argue
with
a
beer
that
can
invoke
childhood
memories
i
enjoyed
this
one
from
start
to
finish
another
nice
seasonal
offering
from
dfh
from
all
of
the
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
so
far
during
the
holidays
this
one
is
very
welcome
in
my
fridge
and
would
work
very
well
with
food
especially
what
people
tend
to
eat
during
the
thanksgiving
holiday
season
vegetal
spicy
and
slightly
sweet
this
is
more
the
direction
that
i
like
these
kinds
of
beers
to
head
towards
recommended
for
those
wanting
to
try
a
good
quality
mass
marketed
pumpkin
ale
o
very
drinkable
not
overpowering
you
can
enjoy
an
imperial
pint
or
two
with
being
sated
although
you
might
want
a
palatecleanser
even
water
alongside
o
solid
pumpkin
beer
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
harvest
beers
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
lot
of
pumpkin
flavors
then
this
may
not
be
for
you
im
not
normally
this
harsh
but
im
calling
a
spade
a
spadethis
beer
is
totally
unrefined
and
borderline
amateurish
dont
know
that
ive
ever
found
anything
by
dogfish
head
i
enjoy
but
even
by
that
standard
this
is
subpar
dogfish
again
delivers
a
decent
beer
but
yet
again
being
way
overpriced
13
4pack
o
not
a
bad
rendition
of
this
specialty
style
definitely
worth
a
try
pretty
fast
dissipating
head
on
a
amber
colored
body
this
beer
really
does
smell
like
the
holidays
malty
smell
followed
by
spices
and
pumpkin
pie
the
taste
is
the
same
rich
and
deep
malt
flavor
with
with
a
nice
alcohol
middle
and
a
spicy
sweet
finish
great
beer
for
the
holiday
season
o
my
first
pumpkin
beer
that
i
enjoyed
i
like
how
balanced
and
easy
drinking
it
is
loved
the
smooth
sweet
after
taste
thought
it
could
use
a
bit
more
pumpkin
flavors
in
the
forfront
if
there
are
other
pumpkin
beers
as
good
or
better
i
may
need
to
give
more
pumkin
beers
a
chance
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
o
well
balanced
beer
perfect
for
the
season
i
would
drink
couple
of
these
throughout
the
day
during
the
holidays
i
would
buy
this
again
great
holiday
beer
d
very
nice
a
great
fall
brew
alcohol
does
not
say
7
to
this
guy
o
overall
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
good
taste
for
the
season
o
i
have
been
noticing
many
pumpkin
ales
it
was
good
enough
to
try
more
punkin
is
a
quality
pumpkin
ale
it
is
not
the
strongest
or
the
most
spicepumpkin
forward
but
rather
a
mild
easy
drinking
pumpkin
flavored
brown
ale
it
is
a
crystal
clear
light
brown
ale
with
some
nice
malty
brown
ale
notes
dominating
the
nose
there
is
a
pleasant
pumpkin
and
spice
nose
present
but
does
not
dominate
the
aroma
this
holds
true
in
the
flavor
as
well
nice
pumpkin
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
overall
punkin
is
a
soft
easy
drinking
brown
ale
with
some
pleasant
pumpkin
qualities
dogfish
head
punkin
ale
45
o
decent
brew
you
can
tell
it
was
brewed
with
real
pumpkin
nothing
attention
grabbing
like
some
other
pumpkins
i
have
had
recently
just
a
simple
well
done
pumpkin
ale
still
very
solid
beer
and
especially
for
a
pumpkin
ale
will
buy
again
if
no
other
new
offerings
for
fall
are
around
o
im
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
when
theyre
done
right
and
dfh
has
done
a
superb
job
on
this
one
ive
had
a
few
others
that
have
a
nicer
balance
and
bring
out
the
pumpkin
flavor
more
gracefully
but
it
remains
a
seasonal
favorite
every
fall
o
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
in
that
it
isnt
dominated
by
the
pumpkin
spices
but
rather
drinks
nicely
like
a
normal
ale
o
good
and
better
than
most
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
waiting
to
try
pumpkinatora
and
pumpking
but
this
does
not
quite
match
the
flavor
of
whole
hog
pumpkin
good
but
not
quite
worth
the
price
and
slight
hassle
to
track
down
imo
a
balanced
and
refined
pumpkin
ale
highlights
spices
and
the
clean
malt
bill
more
than
the
pumpkin
look
forward
to
this
one
every
year
overall
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
overall
maybe
im
being
a
perfectionist
but
yet
again
i
found
there
to
be
too
much
spice
in
this
brew
and
almost
all
of
the
others
i
have
tried
in
this
category
that
said
the
fade
into
a
creamy
pumpkinbrown
sugar
mouthfeel
made
up
for
it
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
so
far
100
recommend
i
wouldnt
expect
any
less
from
dfh
overall
one
of
my
favorite
fall
pumpkin
ales
because
it
balanced
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
with
real
beer
and
malt
flavors
sometimes
pumpkin
ales
are
overdone
and
overwhelming
to
the
palate
with
sweetness
and
dessert
like
flavors
i
like
this
one
because
it
is
one
you
can
definitely
drink
a
full
six
pack
of
and
not
completely
fatigue
your
palate
poured
in
a
16
oz
pint
glass
at
maxs
café
gloucester
nj
o
its
not
great
but
its
better
than
a
few
others
in
the
style
ive
had
it
has
potential
as
a
pumpkin
ale
for
those
who
dont
like
pumpkin
ales
its
also
reasonably
complex
and
only
offers
a
mild
spice
note
but
to
me
it
still
tastes
a
little
uninspired
its
been
a
while
since
ive
properly
enjoyed
something
from
dfh
i
think
it
was
a
2011
bottle
of
wws
and
this
doesnt
quite
change
my
mind
about
that
overall
i
have
always
held
dogfish
as
one
of
the
premier
breweries
in
the
states
and
i
remember
this
beer
from
a
long
time
ago
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
it
for
a
while
and
im
not
disappointed
but
i
come
away
wanting
more
good
taste
with
great
mouth
feel
this
is
a
good
beer
it
just
doesnt
do
everything
other
than
mouthfeel
excellently
anyway
id
say
even
if
you
dont
like
pumpkin
beers
this
one
is
worth
a
shot
dont
usually
go
for
flavored
beers
but
this
is
such
a
well
known
seasonal
beer
i
had
to
try
it
good
flavorful
sweet
and
different
worthy
of
a
repeat
but
would
enjoy
a
glass
at
a
time
not
stocking
up
the
fridge
mouthfeel
is
great
there
is
a
very
dry
harvest
ale
feel
that
has
a
perfect
balance
of
bitterness
that
keeps
this
really
crisp
o
a
great
beer
for
the
season
couldnt
think
of
a
better
way
to
celebrate
the
start
of
fall
this
ale
is
definitely
another
example
of
dfhs
creativity
and
ability
to
create
high
quality
complex
beers
i
havent
had
many
other
pumpkin
ales
but
its
hard
to
try
another
one
when
this
one
is
so
good
definitely
check
this
out
if
you
get
the
chance
very
complex
tasting
ale
first
taste
is
like
a
burnt
pumpkin
seed
second
taste
is
like
a
pumpkin
ale
meets
a
porter
dont
be
turned
off
by
the
smell
and
first
taste
this
ale
seems
to
taste
better
with
each
sip
this
is
not
your
typical
pumpkin
ale
o
an
enjoyable
fall
ale
with
some
unique
flavors
so
this
was
my
first
foray
into
craft
brew
and
out
of
piss
in
a
can
hood
call
it
beginners
luck
or
whatever
you
want
but
this
is
a
great
tasting
brew
in
all
respects
its
sufficiently
bitter
enough
though
not
so
much
that
it
becomes
hard
to
drink
no
real
up
front
pumpkin
flavor
to
speak
of
though
its
in
the
aroma
for
sure
the
taste
comes
into
play
after
youve
taken
your
sip
and
let
your
mouth
warm
back
up
a
bit
then
you
get
that
pumpkin
or
should
i
say
punkin
pie
taste
creeping
in

being

really
arent

ales

anyone

for
a

pretty

for

of
the
beer
carbonation
is
moderate
overall
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
of

id
probably
put
it
in

very
solid

probably
should
have
drank
this
sooner
a
dirty
amber
color
with
a
small
head
the
spices
are
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
some
clove
the
flavor
has
really
weakened
over
the
cellars
time
slight
cloves
and
nutmeg
but
really
mellow
the
mouthful
is
good
since
nothing
is
overpowering
and
the
alcohol
at
7
is
not
noticeable
i
really
enjoyed
this
fresh
but
never
reviewed
it
then
would
have
rated
it
higher
when
i
first
tasted
this
it
was
rather
cold
and
i
was
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
pumpkin
it
is
after
all
a
pumpkin
beer
but
as
it
warmed
up
the
flavors
came
through
much
more
fully
and
i
was
able
to
enjoy
the
spices
the
malts
and
the
pumpkin

with
a
nice
foamy

poured
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cinnamon
clove
and
pumpkin
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
nutmeg
cinnamon
clove
and
pumpkin
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
brew
i
know
that
i
was
having
this
one
a
little
late
and
likely
past
its
prime
going
into
it
but
it
still
managed
to
be
pretty
nice
not
my
favorite
offering
ive
had
from
the
style
but
still
definitely
a
tasty
brew
all
aspects
of
this
one
were
good
and
in
the
right
portions
to
keep
you
wondering
what
was
next
a
definite
must
try
for
any
fan
of
the
style
di
have
to
remind
myself
that
the
abv
on
this
is
not
all
that
low
bc
i
want
to
drink
more
and
more
of
it
fall
and
this
beer
are
made
for
each
other
overall
good
easy
drinking
and
not
overdone
with
offensive
spicing
i
actually
tasted
some
pumpkin
and
enjoyed
this
get
this
even
if
you
have
you
have
yet
to
find
a
pumpkin

you
like

may

copper
color
under

also
a
great
lacing
throughout
the
nose
here
is
a
deep
and
spicy
one
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
nutmeg
and
that
overall
lovely
pumpkin
aroma
that
fills
the
air
when
fresh
pumpkin
pie
is
baking
the
aroma
notes
here
are
all
very
indicative
of
what
i
pick
up
in
the
taste
as
well
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
to
just
the
right
level
where
the
flavors
shine
through
beautifully
together
and
the
malt
can
work
its
smooth
magic
on
the
palate
i
cant
wait
for
next
years
batch
and
hope
to
try
this
on
tap
andor
cask
as
well
the
cpj
cheers
the
taste
is
a
little
disappointing
in
my
opinion
yes
i
can
taste
the
ingredients
used
but
i
expected
it
to
be
a
bit
more
fullbodied
thats
probably
just
my
bias
toward
fullbodied
beers
talking
but
thats
my
preference
even
though
the
abv
is
only
7
you
can
still
taste
the
alcohol
well
its
still
a
good
beer
though
i
definitely
recommend
it
for
the
fall
season
overall
a
nice
seasonal
offering
from
dfh
that
unfortunately
needs
a
couple
months
to
condition
before
i
can
drink
it
the
peak
for
my
own
preference
was
mid
january
if
you
can
contain
yourself
you
should
try
aging
one
for
a
couple
months
and
see
how
you
like
it
had
this
on
tap
at
city
beer
store
in
san
francisco
reviewing
from
my
notes
from
november
i
thought
i
was
going
to
miss
this
beer
this
year
again
but
i
travelled
from
the
east
coast
to
the
west
coast
and
caught
up
with
it
pours
an
amberorange
colour
with
thin
white
head
with
some
lacing
smells
of
pumpkin
pie
pretty
much
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
brown
sugar
nice
sweet
flavour
this
is
just
what
youd
want
in
a
pumpkin
beer
d
overall
very
nice
a
pumpkin
beer
that
doesnt
overdo
the
sweetness
or
the
spices
d
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
it
needed
a
little
more
thickness
to
it
and
a
heavier
pumpkin
flavor
and
a
little
less
spice
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
though
d
gotta
say
it
was
a
solid
pumpkin
and
is
probably
one
of
my
top
five
as
far
as
the
style
goes
it
was
tasty
and
drank
good
a
beer
that
the
quality
has
declined
noticably
over
the
years
i
still
prefer
the
tap
over
12
oz
bottle
which
is
usually
poured
in
a
pint
glass
pours
an
orangecopper
with
a
light
ring
of
foam
sugary
aroma
with
light
spice
alcohol
is
very
present
in
the
taste
with
ginger
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
in
the
background
wow
thin
carbonation
decent
body
what
an
interesting
approach
to
pumpkin
beer
high
alcohol
really
surprises
great
spice
but
wheres
the
pumpkin
d
wonderful
and
warming
slightly
better
with
age
but
after
3
months
or
12
months
it
essentially
drinks
the
same
as
it
does
in
season
it
doesnt
age
like
some
of
dogfishs
bigger
beers
one
is
good
but
two
are
better
this
is
everything
you
could
hope
for
in
a
pumpkin
ale
this
beer
is
amazing
i
cant
wait
until
september
so
i
can
pick
up
a
case
it
has
an
amber
appearance
it
had
a
nice
12
white
head
with
good
lacing
it
has
a
nice
roasted
pumpkin
and
brown
sugar
scent
it
tastes
incredible

this
makes
a

that
is

must
have
each
fall
season
too
bad
it
can
be
so
hard
to
find
in
2007
i
sample
this
beer
at
that
time
i
did
not
think
that
it
surpassed
brooklyn
brewerys
post
road
pumpkin
ale
it
must
has
been
an
off
year
because
there
is
no
other
pumpkin
beer
that
can
match
dogfish
heads
punkin
ale
it
has
the
perfect
balance
of
spice
pumpkin
and
brown
sugar
flavor
fall
is
my
favorite
season
and
i
think
it
is
because
punkin
ale
is
the
taste
of
the
season
the
mouthfeel
isnt
overly
carbonated
and
has
a
slightly
creamy
feel
i
think
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
perfect
for
fall
serving
type
bottle
d
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
a
few
but
never
have
enough
in
the

wish
i
could
get
ahold
of
a
case
instead
of
4
at
a
time

i
enjoyed
this

it

but

very

warming
pumpkin

drinks

i
would

recommend
as
a

or
holiday
treat
m
very
smooth

nice
medium
to
full
body
d
very
high
really
an
enjoyable
fall
brew
i
recall
in
years
prior
enjoying
this
beer
much
more
than
the
present
perhaps
theyve
changed
the
recipe
its
difficult
to
say
the
taste
isnt
as
enjoyable
as
it
once
was
i
dont
understand
the
sweetness
factor
present
now
ill
still
see
if
i
can
snag
this
next
year
and
find
if
anything
has
changed
but
im
currently
no
longer
impressed
by
this
offering
poured
a
fantastic
deep
orange
amber
with
thin
head
nose
is
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
allspice
lingering
honeysweet
malt
presence
sweet
start
with
high
carbonation
pumpkin
dominates
the
rest
and
the
allspice
has
a
clovelike
effect
crisp
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
d
this
is
very
well
rounded
most
pumpkin
ales
a
so
full
of
spice
that
you
may
really
only
want
them
around
the
holiday
i
think
this
brew
is
great
year
round
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
a
copper
color
with
a
white
foamy
head
the
aroma
smells
of
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
spices
the
taste
is
sweet
and
the
pumpkin
pie
spice
is
strong
the
hops
and
the
malt
are
almost
lost
in
the
spice
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
i
would
consider
this
a
drinkable
beer
this
is
an
awesome
beer
that
screams
fall
it
is
delicious
but
because
its
such
a
unique
taste
its
not
necessarily
one
that
you
would
want
a
bunch
of
in
one
sitting
i
guess
thats
nice
seeing
as
it
comes
in
a
four
pack
d
very
easy
to
drink
because
its
not
overly
done
on
the
spice
end
would
be
delicious
with
a
pumpkin
pie
drinkability
sits
heavy
in
the
stomach
and
the
abv
is
high
but
it
taste
so
good
that
these
factors
are
less
of
an
issue
surprised
by
how
dry
this
beer
is
i
recalled
it
being
sweeter
and
maltforward
maybe
thats
part
of
its
charm
nevertheless
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
and
i
can
see
buying
a
4
pack
a
year
maybe
more
o
pretty
good
but
i
still
think
schlafly
makes
the
best
pumpkin
beer
out
there
still
a
solid
effort
and
id
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
again
if
i
saw
it
pretty
drinkable
but
i
think
id
get
bored
with
it
after
a
few
smooth
and
slightly
prickly
this
brew
tastes
of
more
pumpkin
pie
spices
sweet
malts
are
complemented
by
the
gentle
warming
of
alcohol
mediumbodied
and
very
drinkable
sampled
during
the
winter
2010
tasting
brought
by
deuce
punkin
pours
a
deep
dark
orange
that
lightens
and
clears
considerably
when
properly
lit
the
beige
head
rises
to
about
two
fingers
in
stature
but
doesnt
stick
around
all
that
long
nor
does
it
leave
much
evidence
of
its
former
existence
nose
is
pretty
much
what
one
would
expect
from
a
well
made
pumpkin
ale
pumpkin
comes
through
along
with
an
intriguing
blend
of
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
come
through
better
than
the
allspice
brown
sugar
was
advertised
on
the
bottle
and
while
it
didnt
show
up
in
the
aroma
it
comes
through
just
fine
on
the
front
end
of
each
sip
that
and
an
improved
allspice
presence
among
the
pumpkin
and
spices
on
the
back
end
really
take
this
beer
to
the
next
level
carbonation
is
fine
middle
of
the
road
in
terms
of
intensity
punkin
could
stand
to
be
a
little
bit
more
rich
though
the
body
comes
across
as
a
little
thin
for
a
decent
sized
pumpkin
ale
punkin
is
a
very
good
beer
its
got
a
great
flavor
but
some
of
the
other
aspects
are
just
a
bit
off
still
another
quality
beer
from
dogfish
head
i
had
to
try
this
one
i
picked
up
a
couple
of
these
first
off
it
has
a
darker
golden
appearance
the
scent
is
there
with
the
punkin
and
nutmeg
the
taste
at
first
takes
a
little
time
to
get
used
to
because
this
isnt
something
you
have
all
the
time
taste
is
punkin
all
the
way
but
once
my
taste
buds
got
used
to
it
drinkability
became
very
easy
i
also
felt
that
7
2
abv
i
was
ready
to
drink
more
and
buy
more
the
next
day
only
thing
is
you
get
four
for
8
99
or
9
99
man
i
want
at
least
six
for
that
price
so
i
can
share
some
with
punkin
lovers
but
i
will
definitely
buy
more
next
fall
this
beer
earns
a
score
of
4
35
on
draft
im
struggling
to
put
down
a
whole
one
of
these
it
really
tastes
more
like
a
winter
warmer
to
me
not
as
pumpkin
ale
like
as
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
i
will
not
be
having
this
one
again
anytime
soon
there
are
several
other
better
pumpkin
beers
than
this
one
poured
into
a
brooklyn
brewery
pint
glass
i
have
three
of
these
left
for
thanksgiving
might
as
well
review
one
now
though
pours
a
copperburnt
orange
color
semitransparent
surprisingly
large
head
with
outstanding
lacing
smells
of
nutmeg
clove
cinnamon
smells
like
a
bakery
massive
amounts
of
cinnamon
come
to
the
forefront
of
the
palate
with
nutmeg
and
other
more
subtle
spices
coming
to
prominence
halfway
through
the
taste
and
the
alcohol
pokes
its
head
through
during
the
finish
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
decent
the
finish
is
a
bit
rough
but
it
is
full
bodied
and
filling
this
beer
is
definitely
a
sipper
but
i
came
back
time
and
time
again
for
this
one
and
im
glad
i
saved
a
few
for
next
thursday
very
nice
head
forms
when
this
beer
is
poured
the
hue
is
a
nice
reddish
copper
the
head
remains
for
some
time
and
leaves
clear
lines
of
retention
the
beer
effervesces
continuously
helping
to
maintain
the
head
the
smell
is
predominantly
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
a
slight
hint
of
pumpkin
and
rye
taste
is
all
about
lightly
sweetened
pumpkin
pie
the
dominant
flavors
are
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
but
the
focus
on
those
spices
helps
make
this
beer
quite
drinkable
the
beer
seems
to
be
a
little
light
on
the
body
this
beer
to
coat
the
tongue
a
little
more
considering
its
a
fallwinter
beer
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
and
if
one
plans
on
drinking
more
than
one
all
is
well
pours
a
deep
orangish
copperbrown
bubbly
head
that
settles
at
a
thin
film
after
about
ten
seconds
very
strong
pumpkin
pie
spice
smell
clove
cinnamon
nutmeg
allspice
anise
all
these
and
probably
more
are
in
there
there
is
also
a
fresh
pumpkin
smell
like
when
you
carve
into
a
jackolantern
flavor
is
malty
sweet
and
fruity
at
first
more
of
that
fresh
pumpking
smelltaste
comes
out
the
spice
takes
over
every
other
flavor
quickly
in
the
end
the
only
other
flavor
is
a
hint
of
booze
on
my
lips
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
the
spiced
pumpkin
beers
every
fall
i
try
to
keep
an
open
mind
but
the
spices
always
turn
me
off
it
was
hard
to
finish
the
bottle
if
you
are
into
pumpkin
beers
this
is
a
probably
a
great
one
its
just
not
for
me
actually
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
but
smuttynoses
kills
this
one
more
depth
and
seems
more
authentic
while
i
personally
still
prefer
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
of
the
shipyard
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
stellar
beer
i
think
im
headed
back
to
buy
the
rest
to
have
on
thanksgiving
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
not
really
what
id
hoped
for
and
not
up
to
par
with
dogfishs
other
offerings
in
the
past
this
was
an
in
your
face
nutmeg
bomb
but
its
now
evolved
into
a
more
balanced
nutmeg
beer
im
satisfied
with
my
12oz
and
may
revisit
in
a
year
but
im
glad
this
one
doesnt
have
5
friends
in
the
fridge
and
i
wont
be
anxiously
waiting
for
this
one
to
come
around
again
d
ive
read
the
posts
that
say
that
the
punkin
ale
this
year
is
not
as
good
as
the
one
last
year
better
than
the
one
last
year
blah
blah
blah
blah
whatever
i
totally
see
the
appeal
of
this
beer
to
thousands
making
it
one
of
the
top
selling
pumpkin
ales
or
seasonal
brews
in
general
on
the
market
i
dig
it
and
totally
respect
it
really
good
pumpkin
beer
on
of
the
best
i
have
tasted
because
you
get
a
real
feel
of
the
spices
and
body
is
good
tastes
similar
to
a
pumpkin
pie
warning
could
be
too
sweet
for
some
this
comes
in
a
four
pack
and
i
am
always
sad
wishing
had
i
more
once
it
is
gone
seasonal
beer
as
well
poured
to
about
a
one
inch
head
head
was
slightly
orangish
in
color
head
didnt
hang
around
very
long
but
did
leave
a
little
lacing
ale
itself
was
kind
of
a
goldish
brown
had
a
sweet
smell
along
with
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
wasnt
as
strong
as
what
i
had
expected
the
flavor
was
actually
mild
just
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
then
again
nothing
overwhelming
all
the
flavors
were
on
the
mild
side
felt
good
in
the
mouth
i
thought
the
carbonation
was
about
right
i
wouldnt
mind
a
few
of
these
at
halloween
time
i
just
dont
think
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
this
beer
poured
an
orangishcopper
color
and
had
a
large
amount
of
carbonation
the
beer
had
an
aroma
of
pumpkin
spicenutmeg
i
believe
it
had
a
fairly
strong
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
taste
it
was
smooth
light
and
very
drinkable
for
a
fall
pumpkin
beer
d
this
one
is
a
great
fallwinter
beer
drinking
it
on
a
cold
ny
night
and
its
really
nice
love
the
crispness
you
get
here
especially
with
the
carbonation
and
spice
characters
its
good
not
the
worst
but
not
the
best
the
spice
is
bold
and
gets
annoying
after
a
while
taste
nice
balance
of
spices
no
one
spice
is
too
dominate
good
pumpkin
flavor
smooth
and
not
too
heavy
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
goes
down
more
like
a
5
or
6
overall
another
review
done
mostly
out
of
memory
not
my
favorite
dogfish
head
brew
but
then
again
i
like
pretty
much
all
their
beers
ive
tried
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
pumpkin
beer
it
is
worth
trying
always
a
treat
to
have
punkin
on
tap
a
great
looking
pumpkin
beer
for
me
punkin
has
the
perfect
balance
of
pumpkin
spices
in
a
beer
it
doesnt
even
taste
like
a
7
either
allowing
great
drinkability
this
beer
gets
better
as
you
drink
it
the
first
sip
might
not
come
off
all
that
well
further
into
it
though
i
find
myself
enjoying
its
array
of
spice
flavors
and
not
wishing
for
more
or
less
spices
it
holds
up
well
over
time
too
amber
with
a
slight
chill
haze
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
film
poor
head
retention
strongest
aroma
characteristic
is
cloves
followed
by
bready
sweetness
bit
of
a
carbonation
bite
up
front
malty
and
sweet
up
front
middle
is
redolent
with
cloves
and
also
sweet
the
alcohol
also
shows
its
head
about
here
a
nice
finish
with
a
hint
of
hops
medium
mouthfeel
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
2010
bottling
date
2
fingers
of
immediate
very
bubbly
head
with
awful
retention
diarrhea
brown
body
little
bit
of
lacing
but
not
much
persistent
bubbles
hit
of
pumpkin
pie
off
the
bat
all
those
wonderful
spices
nutmeg
etc
some
sort
of
pilsner
hop
smell
spicy
goodness
nice
rich
brown
ale
flavor
toasty
spicy
slightly
sweet
light
lingering
bitterness
very
dry
on
the
mouth
sticky
nicely
drinkable
for
7
there
was
a
more
pronounced
pumpkin
flavor
than
the
other
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
this
year
that
being
said
the
upfront
flavors
are
the
aforementioned
spices
there
was
a
mildly
malty
flavor
there
as
well
finished
bitter
didnt
really
get
any
of
the
sweetness
that
i
was
expecting
after
reading
brewed
with
brown
sugar
on
medium
body
medium
carbonation
somewhat
dry
finish
it
was
a
good
pumpkin
beer
but
i
think
the
spiciness
would
keep
me
from
drinking
multiples
d
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
would
try
it
on
tap
but
not
out
of
the
bottle
again
drinkability
great
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
good
flavor
overall
a
benchmark
for
the
style
nice
pumpkin
beer
that
shows
all
the
right
spice
motes
with
a
moderate
ale
as
a
base
not
as
complex
as
elysians
night
owl
or
as
rich
still
a
very
drinkable
example
of
the
style
that
for
a
lot
of
people
defines
the
genre
the
golden
colour
is
pretty
in
the
glass
drinkability
not
terribly
impressed
by
this
one
honestly
spice
and
pumpkin
are
muted
hops
are
too
forward
and
theres
this
strange
astringency
that
made
this
hard
for
me
to
get
into
admittedly
this
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
so
your
mileage
may
vary
last
night
i
finally
had
a
chance
to
sit
down
and
crack
open
the
growler
and
was
quite
satisfied
by
this
ale
it
of
course
poured
with
abundant
head
cottony
fluffy
leaving
strands
of
lacing
yellowish
amber
hue
and
clean
wonderful
balance
in
aroma
and
flavor
spices
are
present
thankfully
not
in
a
pumpkin
pie
bouquet
but
they
merely
lend
touches
to
what
is
actually
a
lovely
pumpkinmalt
blend
the
pumpkin
and
some
faint
nuttiness
steps
forward
in
the
taste
while
the
malt
and
spices
seem
to
lead
the
scent
what
i
really
appreciate
and
enjoy
here
is
that
the
pumpkin
is
featured
quite
well
not
pushed
down
or
muted
by
a
loud
lousy
concoction
of
pie
flavorings
as
many
of
these
ales
are
the
pumpkin
comes
across
a
little
roasty
as
well
the
beer
drinks
mediumbodied
clean
and
somewhat
dry
an
allaround
wellconstructed
pumpkin
ale
experience
overall
if
you
like
pumpkin
youll
like
this
end
of
story
a
lot
of
people
think
they
like
pumpkin
but
actually
like
all
the
spices
that
pumpkin
dishes
are
prepared
with
remember
pumpkin
is
a
gourd
a
vegetable
not
a
sugary
cinnamon
pie
that
being
said
i
like
this
beer
definitely
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
it
tastes
natural
and
fresh
nothing
artificial
about
this
one
at
all
make
sure
to
let
this
one
warm
a
little
because
the
sweetness
comes
through
with
warmth
mouthfeeldrinkability
desert
drink
decent
pumpkin
brew
taste
is
a
mixture
of
nutmeg
spices
and
cinnamon
heres
a
seasonal
i
could
drink
year
round
drinkability
a
great
fall
seasonal
from
dogfish
head
nice
balance
between
spice
and
sweetness
and
a
supremely
creamy
body
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
couple
pints
of
this
over
the
winter
months
as
well
o
there
are
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
edit
i
now
drink
this
every
fall
season
it
is
a
great
beer
that
i
wish
dogfish
would
build
off
with
other
beers
as
opposed
to
their
constant
ipa
infatuation
i
spoke
with
a
beer
distributor
who
told
me
the
dogfish
punkin
sells
out
day
1
and
the
other
punkin
beers
sit
there
for
a
month
until
they
are
taken
it
is
by
far
the
best
punkin
beer
out
there
d
would
have
been
nicer
if
it
had
a
bit
stronger
pumpkin
taste
but
overall
a
very
nice
fall
beer
d
swigging
down
a
four
pack
is
too
easy
absolutely
elegant
d
too
light
on
the
pumpkin
decent
spice
highlights
a
little
thin
and
the
alcohol
was
present
not
the
best
ive
had
this
fall
poured
a
nice
brownish
orange
color
with
a
decent
head
that
left
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
a
lot
of
different
scents
in
this
like
nutmeg
pumpkin
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
a
little
bit
of
hop
presence
tasted
better
than
a
lot
of
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
had
had
a
nice
balance
the
pumpkin
was
definitely
there
but
not
too
sweet
you
could
taste
all
of
the
spices
that
you
could
smell
but
none
of
them
were
too
stong
mouthfeel
was
good
went
down
smooth
nice
medium
body
and
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
and
i
would
definitely
have
a
couple
more
of
these
cheers
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
fall
beers
my
sister
in
law
isnt
generally
a
beer
personbut
ive
been
giving
her
small
samples
of
beers
shes
liked
some
big
stouts
and
handled
some
hoppy
ipa
okay
she
liked
saranacs
sweet
but
uninspired
pumpkin
ale
this
was
the
first
beer
she
handed
back
to
me
could
not
finish
a
3
oz
sample
a
nice
spicy
hearty
fall
ale
with
a
just
a
bit
too
much
octane
to
make
it
a
serious
imbibing
contender
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
imo
bc
its
taken
in
a
different
direction
than
most
others
to
continue
with
the
perfection
of
this
favorite
brown
ale
the
taste
was
the
complete
embodiment
of
the
nose
only
with
the
liquid
sustenance
it
was
lightly
spicy
right
off
the
bat
keeping
my
tongue
tingling
with
happiness
while
cinnamon
pumpkin
pie
and
a
generous
amount
of
caramel
washed
over
it
all
of
this
was
accompanied
by
nutmeg
brown
sugar
and
allspice
all
of
which
are
extremely
complimenting
of
each
other
no
one
flavor
tries
to
dominate
the
others
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
medium
body
like
a
heavy
silk
and
everything
is
supported
by
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
it
ends
slightly
dry
with
very
little
bitterness
and
pulls
everything
together
with
a
comforting
warmth
from
the
7
abv
which
gives
it
an
a
in
my
book
fairly
aggressive
pour
leaves
2
fingers
on
thick
creamy
head
which
recedes
after
a
few
minutes
leaving
some
nice
lacing
in
my
tulip
i
get
some
spices
in
the
smell
mainly
cinnamon
nutmeg
initial
taste
is
of
the
spices
mentioned
in
the
nose
i
get
more
and
more
pumpkin
as
this
ale
warms
a
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
but
not
in
a
bad
way
dfh
punkin
is
a
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
that
is
always
worth
seeking
out
when
the
leaves
begin
to
fall
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
but
not
the
best
and
im
a
dfh
fan
the
beer
pours
a
burnt
orange
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
delicious
smell
like
a
pumpkin
pie
spicy
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
the
all
spice
the
taste
brings
a
perfect
medley
of
flavors
sizable
malt
flavor
with
all
the
spiciness
of
the
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
all
spice
the
beer
is
smooth
with
a
nice
sweetness
and
subtle
presence
of
pumpkin
i
can
drink
this
over
and
over
again
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
fades
fast
the
spices
are
apparent
in
the
smell
but
not
overpowering
the
smell
has
some
great
malt
presence
mixing
well
with
the
nutmeg
the
flavor
is
a
nice
blend
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
all
spice
the
bottle
says
it
is
brewed
with
brown
sugar
so
i
expected
some
sweetness
but
no
sweetness
comes
through
this
one
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
but
has
a
hearty
feel
to
it
this
one
is
a
great
drinker
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
are
concerned
the
flavors
come
together
nicely
and
do
not
overpower
this
one
is
a
great
fall
beer
very
enjoyable
d
very
drinkable
for
a
7
pumpkin
brown
ale
that
is
well
balanced
and
not
over
the
top
with
spices
well
its
7
abv
but
still
wonderfully
drinkable
and
not
too
too
heavy
clean
with
a
nice
hop
bite
still
its
a
bit
overbalanced
toward
the
spices
rather
than
the
sweet
malt
or
actual
pumpkin
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
but
seekers
of
big
pumpkin
flavor
should
look
elsewhere
d
good
but
not
great
id
like
a
touch
less
spice
a
little
sweeter
finish
and
a
little
more
malt
flavor
still
its
worth
picking
up
during
the
fall
of
the
year
i
have
a
bottle
left
from
the
4pack
and
ill
probably
hang
onto
it
until
next
year
to
see
how
it
tastes
do
easy
drinker
wasnt
ridiculously
upfront
with
the
cinnamon
like
another
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
recently
which
is
good
seems
more
balanced
with
the
flavors
dfh
is
famous
for
its
offcentered
beers
but
this
one
seems
to
be
right
in
the
center
of
its
style
meaning
if
someone
had
not
had
a
pumpkin
beer
this
would
be
the
one
to
give
them
flagship
for
the
style
dfh
never
disappoints
w
this
one
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
on
a
large
scale
i
cant
go
an
october
without
this
beer
it
screams
fall
d
although
referred
to
as
a
fullbodied
brown
ale
on
the
label
this
is
more
like
a
pale
ale
with
aggressive
spices
added
the
unpleasant
flavors
here
may
lend
themselves
more
acceptably
to
the
company
of
mild
savory
dishes
but
taken
alone
they
cannot
help
but
be
called
into
question
ok
if
youre
looking
for
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
go
get
a
southern
tier
pumpking
if
youre
looking
for
the
flavors
of
cinnimon
brown
sugar
nutmeg
with
some
pumpkin
hints
then
this
is
your
beer
pours
nice
amber
color
and
initial
aromas
are
cinnimon
and
spice
flavor
is
nutmeg
with
some
brown
sugar
and
slight
pumpkin
flavor
very
nice
pumkin
beer
i
put
this
one
at
number
3
on
my
pumpkin
beer
list
behind
southern
tiers
pumking
and
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
delicious
and
will
always
be
on
my
shelf
around
this
time
of
year
d
a
superb
fall
seasonal
though
it
is
rich
and
spicy
enough
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
depths
of
winter
too
drink
its
a
very
rainy
day
in
so
cal
and
i
could
easily
put
back
3
or
4
of
these
great
beers
a
slightly
malty
aftertaste
gave
this
beer
an
amazing
overall
taste
overall
this
was
a
perfectly
balance
summer
ale
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
dogfish
really
follow
through
with
the
spicing
brooklyn
and
shipyard
have
a
bit
more
of
a
flat
taste
compared
to
this
done
of
the
easier
drinking
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
so
far
but
the
combination
of
light
body
and
the
strong
spice
tastes
are
not
a
very
good
match
d
a
great
pumpkin
beer
m
d
this
stuff
was
really
tasty
and
one
of
the
better
examples
of
a
pumpkin
ale
i
enjoyed
that
it
was
a
little
less
on
the
spicey
side
and
focused
on
the
pumpkin
for
a
change
highly
recommended
to
any
pumpkin
ale
fan
d
tasty
but
a
tad
too
sweet
to
want
a
whole
4pack
or
order
a
second
an
enjoyable
pint
though
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
flavor
is
a
bit
more
subdued
than
a
lot
of
pumpkin
ales
out
there
but
still
decent
goes
well
with
a
pumpkin
dessert
its
decent
if
you
are
looking
for
the
taste
of
autumn
and
i
would
have
more
drinkability
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
the
ale
masterfully
balances
the
intense
spicy
flavors
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
very
nice
sweet
pumpkin
pie
also
the
alcohol
content
is
almost
dangerously
wellhidden
d
always
a
good
choice
this
time
of
year
however
no
more
than
a
couple
at
a
time
d
beyond
easy
i
was
a
fool
to
worry
about
buying
a
four
pack
of
this
beer
it
is
delicious
with
no
faults
i
can
give
it
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
offered
each
season
enjoyable
all
around
yet
not
a
memorable
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
for
me
as
a
brown
id
drink
it
year
round
for
the
extra
perks
but
for
a
straightforward
pumpkin
ale
id
go
elsewhere
pair
up
with
a
stuffed
pork
chop
d
though
i
didnt
really
want
to
drink
a
pumpkin
soda
d
an
all
around
great
brew
and
a
true
benchmark
for
the
style
drinkability
very
interesting
brew
here
a
little
more
bitter
than
id
normally
like
but
still
very
complex
would
make
a
great
foodpairing
type
of
beer
example
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
but
definitely
not
bad
about
as
much
nutmeg
as
i
can
take
without
it
hurting
my
liking
that
said
i
like
it
but
maybe
two
is
my
limit
poured
into
a
pint
glass
showed
a
brownish
amberorange
with
decent
head
little
retention
and
lacing
smell
of
pumpkins
cinnamon
bready
malt
and
spice
taste
of
bready
malts
up
front
sweet
pumpkin
balanced
by
the
blend
of
spices
mentioned
on
bottle
nutmeg
and
allspice
to
leave
a
complex
finish
great
seasonal
beer
hides
the
alcohol
well
d
i
like
this
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
i
could
have
more
than
3
in
a
session
i
have
to
say
that
im
very
disappointed
with
this
brew
from
dfh
overall
there
isnt
anything
that
makes
it
stand
out
from
other
commercial
offerings
and
with
the
flood
of
pumpkin
ales
for
the
holiday
season
this
beer
is
little
more
than
lackluster
for
my
taste
buds
now
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
nice
carbonation
appearance
is
that
of
brewed
tea
this
is
only
my
2nd
pumpkin
ale
so
not
sure
if
that
is
normal
or
not
smell
is
very
nice
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
allspice
and
brown
sugar
are
all
there
ditto
for
taste
a
very
nice
full
flavored
pumpkin
ale
without
being
too
sweet
or
spicy
mouthfeel
seems
perfect
and
drinkability
is
great
despite
a
7
abv
a
very
nice
blend
i
would
definitely
pick
up
a
4pack
of
these
overall
this
is
the
best
yet
representation
of
the
pumpkin
ale
the
dogfish
head
crew
delivers
very
high
drinkability
glad
i
bought
2
packs
theres
the
definite
ale
taste
to
it
not
overpowering
as
some
as
far
as
pumpkin
pie
type
spices
drinks
like
a
true
fresh
pumpkin
beer
best
pumpkin
beer
ever
full
and
rich
tastes
like
ale
and
fall
drinkable
but
one
will
do
doesnt
taste
like
a
candle
or
like
a
scented
budwater
one
more
perfect
beer
from
dfh
d
very
high
the
excellent
mixture
between
spice
and
pumpkin
helps
this
one
go
down
easy
and
makes
me
almost
reach
for
another
bottle
immediately
although
i
do
wish
the
alcohol
hid
a
bit
more
behind
the
richer
flavors
for
7
abv
i
could
sip
this
one
all
day
d
easy
to
drink
but
i
think
it
could
be
better
with
some
stronger
flavors
more
pumpkin
smell
is
the
best
part
d
very
easy
drinker
surprisingly
good
drinkability
this
is
a
good
seasonal
brew
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
dfh
i
would
have
expected
more
outrageous
over
the
top
spices
bigger
malt
and
more
sweetness
from
the
folks
at
dfh
but
never
the
less
easy
to
drink
despite
the
alcohol
and
still
a
great
flavored
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
representations
of
a
pumpkin
flavored
beer
its
maltiness
holds
up
to
the
spices
and
the
spices
dont
overwhelm
the
pumpkins
roasty
characteristics
the
head
was
adequate
and
the
carbonation
was
right
on
clear
and
beautifully
orangebrown
the
color
was
spot
on
nothing
to
complain
about
that
having
been
said
it
wasnt
something
i
would
beg
to
bring
around
yearround
or
anything
fairly
drinkable
deep
orange
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
pours
with
a
thin
white
head
that
reduces
quickly
to
a
white
wispy
cap
sweet
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
spicy
aromas
medium
bodied
with
lovely
carbonation
spicy
coriander
flavors
in
the
beginning
that
lead
to
sweet
malt
and
pumpkin
flavors
and
very
clean
finish
im
not
a
huge
pumpkin
ale
lover
but
i
am
a
dfh
lover
so
i
was
compelled
to
try
this
i
recall
trying
4
or
5
different
pumpkin
ales
last
fall
and
each
of
them
left
me
feeling
like
i
was
drinking
a
glass
of
potpourri
the
dfh
punkin
ale
was
nothing
like
the
others
the
spice
does
not
overwhelm
the
big
malty
character
and
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
a
sweet
flavor
than
spice
excellent
pumpkin
ale
d
i
would
probably
drink
this
beer
again
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
at
least
once
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
it
certainly
makes
other
pumpkin
ales
seem
like
childs
play
there
is
a
medium
feel
with
creamy
carb
and
just
a
really
nice
refreshing
vibe
going
on
i
like
this
beer
and
ill
revisit
it
again
this
season
and
next
it
makes
beers
like
southern
tiers
pumking
seem
gimmicky
by
actually
remembering
to
be
a
beer
although
its
not
without
its
flaws
the
biggest
of
which
is
the
notable
alcohol
punkin
is
a
worthy
autumn
seasonal
just
about
any
beer
lover
would
enjoy
theres
not
much
more
to
say
i
loved
this
beer
and
thought
it
was
absolutely
perfect
with
sunday
brunch
in
the
fall
well
done
drinkability
i
still
buy
this
one
but
only
because
i
cant
get
my
favorite
in
chicago
schlafly
its
kind
of
boozy
tasting
not
just
in
abv
so
i
usually
only
have
one
per
sitting
before
moving
on
to
something
else
there
are
two
schools
on
pumpkin
ales
and
i
land
firmly
in
the
more
spice
the
better
and
i
think
this
is
in
the
more
subtle
arena
i
alos
think
the
balance
is
off
especially
for
the
dogfish
guys
overall
2nd
only
to
pumking
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
for
me
but
they
are
almost
two
different
beasts
all
together
d
overall
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
it
went
down
pretty
easy
even
with
all
of
the
spices
would
i
have
another
why
yes
i
think
i
will
now
i
will
be
sure
to
buy
some
more
to
make
sure
i
have
some
for
thanksgiving

has

5this
is
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
flavor
is
wellbalanced
you
can
taste
the
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
other
spices
but
nothing
dominates
the
aftertaste
is
actually
kind
of
bitter
slightly
hoppy
and
acidictangy
from
the
pumpkin
meat
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
like
so
many
dfh
brews
sweetness
is
brown
sugar
sometimes
molasses
carbonation
is
medium
though
it
appears
lively
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
with
a
nice
alcohol
kick
as
well
although
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
this
one
seems
to
be
the
best
of
the
bunch
for
me
though
its
one
and
done
this
one
is
not
my
favorite
from
dfh
and
it
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
from
me
however
i
do
think
it
is
the
best
of
the
style
and
is
truest
to
form
so
it
definitely
gets
style
points
its
a
frothy
brew
and
the
vanilla
takes
well
to
that
with
the
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
playing
opposite
hits
all
the
taste
buds
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
may
have
liked
something
harsher
in
there
somewhere
pumpkin
head
is
medium
in
body
and
more
full
than
other
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
which
i
appreciate
finish
is
very
clean
happily
without
being
bitter
while
pretty
fullflavored
this
beer
isnt
overpowering
and
its
interesting
enough
to
make
me
drink
it
quickly
d
i
could
get
lost
in
the
smell
of
this
ale
but
i
wish
it
tasted
up
to
the
par
of
its
smell
still
a
good
effort
by
dfh
soid
orange
in
color
with
medium
head
slowly
didapates
into
a
thin
lace
very
bright
aroma
has
a
solid
but
not
overpowering
pumpkin
nose
followed
by
spice
and
a
touch
of
hops
not
too
much
malt
aroma
very
pleasant
flavor
consists
of
a
grainy
malt
right
up
front
followed
by
pumpkin
and
a
touch
of
spices
to
balace
this
beer
out
nothing
is
overpowering
carbonation
is
on
the
lighter
side
overall
this
is
one
tasty
beer
well
rounded
balanced
and
tasty
i
love
pumpkin
beers
id
say
this
is
in
the
top
5
drinkability
hands
down
the
best
pumpkin
beer
in
the
category
not
only
is
it
the
closest
to
hitting
the
mark
on
actual
pumpkin
taste
but
the
added
spiciness
adds
a
zest
that
no
other
pumpkin
ale
on
the
shelf
can
offer
the
7
is
well
hidden
making
this
overly
sessionable
this
is
the
beer
you
want
by
your
side
on
a
crisp
fall
night
get
it
now
while
its
still
in
abundance
overall
a
great
beer
thats
perfect
for
the
fall
seasons
and
holidays
a
highly
memorable
beer
the
only
hindrance
is
price
9
99
for
a
4
pack
light
copper
color
with
a
creamcolored
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
a
rim
with
a
moderate
amount
of
lace
the
aroma
is
spicy
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
dominating
not
as
alluring
as
i
would
like
but
not
bad
the
flavor
brings
more
to
the
table
than
the
aroma
the
same
spices
are
there
but
seem
fuller
and
more
developed
the
cinnamon
comes
forward
and
marries
with
the
fruity
pumpkin
taste
thats
subtle
but
noticeable
it
nicely
carbonated
and
somewhat
refreshing
which
is
nice
given
the
spiceforwardness
of
this
beer
feels
rather
full
bodied
but
doesnt
stick
to
the
palate
i
could
have
used
a
little
more
hop
fruitiness
to
balance
it
out
i
think
but
it
wasnt
a
huge
problem
seems
like
a
good
pairing
for
an
apple
pie
with
a
nice
dollop
of
whipped
cream
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
in
this
seasonal
brew
from
dogfish
and
i
am
beginning
to
think
that
most
of
their
beers
get
more
credit
then
they
deserve
because
they
all
taste
the
same
in
just
little
ways
you
can
totally
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
one
and
even
though
the
pumpkin
taste
is
very
good
and
very
real
it
does
not
make
up
for
how
boring
the
rest
of
the
brew
is
i
dont
know
if
i
just
do
not
care
for
these
pumpkin
brews
i
have
had
a
minor
handful
of
them
not
talking
dogfish
head
and
still
have
one
that
i
thoroughly
enjoy
the
only
reason
i
come
back
to
them
is
because
i
love
pumpkin
but
have
not
yet
found
one
that
translates
into
beer
i
would
totally
pass
on
this
one
i
think
dogfish
gets
to
much
credit
for
beers
that
all
taste
the
same
in
ways
overpriced
and
not
worth
it
drinkability
this
is
a
good
wellmade
pumpkin
ale
with
a
nice
balance
of
spices
think
pumpkin
pie
it
has
good
drinkability
and
it
is
pleasant
throughout
while
i
wont
want
two
or
three
in
a
row
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
on
an
evening
where
you
are
having
only
one
beer
or
want
a
couple
of
different
beers
although
ill
not
drink
one
of
these
every
night
until
they
are
gone
ill
be
having
more
perfect
to
integrate
a
brown
ale
as
a
basis
for
a
fall
seasonal
its
full
of
flavor
and
great
spiceymalty
flavor
its
extremely
enjoyable
and
really
hard
to
find
much
to
critisize
about
probably
the
best
fall
seasonal
ive
had
so
far
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
body
of
the
beer
is
robust
carbonation
is
low
but
fits
well
overall
this
is
a
nice
highly
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
but
it
is
lacking
in
the
pumpkin
flavor
department
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
for
people
who
are
not
huge
pumpkin
lovers
but
if
you
really
want
a
beer
with
lots
of
pumpkin
flavor
then
pumking
is
still
the
way
to
go
overall
its
a
nice
fall
beer
if
im
looking
for
pumpkin
i
wont
crack
one
if
im
looking
for
something
to
enjoy
by
the
fire
on
a
crisp
fall
evening
this
is
something
id
go
for
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
with
good
reasons
very
drinkable
smooth
on
the
mark
pumpkin
and
spiced
just
right
cheers
enjoy
i
did
ontap
at
woodys
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
crisp
dark
orange
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
lasts
as
a
thin
layer
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
spice
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
cinnamon
spices
and
caramel
malts
the
beer
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
one
is
very
enjoyable
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
notes
unusually
laidback
for
dogfish
head
but
its
still
a
solid
choice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
different
this
is
a
musttry
for
pumpkin
pie
lovers
like
myself
drinkablity
is
ok
pretty
smooth
inital
mouttaste
but
after
taste
kind
of
lingers
of
a
sourish
beer
taste
d
its
like
drinking
water
so
its
really
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
will
be
enjoying
this
brew
this
autumn
and
into
the
future
although
in
moderation
the
4pack
offering
and
the
price
do
not
promote
more
frequent
tastings
it
was
pretty
good
but
i
must
say
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
dogfish
head
on
this
one
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
tasty
drink
but
the
problem
i
have
with
it
is
that
taste
of
pumpkin
goes
away
after
a
few
sips
and
becomes
more
of
just
a
mildly
spiced
ale
so
its
a
little
more
on
the
spiced
side
and
a
little
dryer
then
most
pumpkin
ales
also
not
as
sweet
id
say
give
it
a
shot
but
dont
expect
the
crazy
dogfish
style
this
ones
a
little
more
on
the
tamed
side
drinkability
is
high
i
cant
even
taste
the
booze
really
7
a
great
pumpkin
beer
a
lot
of
pumpkin
flavor
without
being
overly
sweet
like
many
pumpkin
beers
i
wouldnt
expect
a
dry
pumpkin
ale
from
dogfish
head
because
of
their
history
of
having
very
sweet
beers
but
this
is
a
real
winner
not
bad
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
nowhere
near
schlafly
there
are
a
lot
of
breweries
producing
pumpkin
ales
so
i
consider
this
one
to
be
in
the
upper
echelon
dogfish
head
is
pretty
consistent
in
producing
fine
quality
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
definitely
drinkable
for
the
season
as
the
pumpkin
flavor
isnt
muted
as
it
is
in
other
varieties
the
best
harvestpumpkin
ales
maintain
the
essence
of
ale
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
the
heat
of
the
7
is
a
little
much
for
the
light
spice
flavors
not
a
horrible
thing
but
i
think
the
flavors
would
come
out
a
little
bit
more
aside
from
it
being
a
little
boozy
its
a
nice
smooth
high
carbonation
a
nice
introduction
into
pumpkin
beers
for
me
d
not
hard
to
finish
this
beer
and
possibly
have
another
one
although
i
this
is
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
it
certainly
is
in
my
top
2
so
far
another
pumpkin
beer
for
me
to
try
this
one
has
some
promise
poured
into
my
pint
glass
the
beer
is
clear
orange
amber
about
an
inch
of
beige
head
caps
my
glass
a
thin
film
of
lace
sticks
to
the
rim
after
the
head
recedes
the
aroma
is
of
course
pumpkin
nutmeg
cinnimon
and
vanilla
basically
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
with
whip
cream
the
flavor
is
not
as
strong
some
pumpkin
follow
by
pumkin
spice
vanilla
seems
rather
strong
a
nice
oaky
flavor
with
a
touch
of
hop
bite
coming
in
at
the
end
not
as
strong
a
pumpkin
flavor
as
i
had
hoped
but
enought
to
satisfy
me
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
well
put
together
pumpkin
ale
not
my
favorite
but
definatley
in
the
conversation
for
top
ten
its
easy
to
drink
and
very
sneaky
at
7
beer
poured
an
average
head
slight
smells
of
nutmeg
and
other
spices
the
taste
lacked
strong
taste
but
was
a
mellow
pumpkin
taste
pretty
easy
to
drink
especially
at
7
says
the
bottle
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
but
there
are
better
i
would
expect
something
greater
from
this
brewing
company
drinkability
pumpkin
ales
are
sort
of
a
fall
tradition
for
new
england
brewers
a
lot
of
them
are
syrupy
and
undrinkable
this
kicks
the
artificial
flavoring
in
the
ass
this
a
truly
what
a
pumpkin
ale
should
be
a
beer
brewed
with
pumpkin
and
spice
the
taste
is
natural
and
is
a
really
good
beer
not
just
for
a
pumpkin
ale
this
wouldnt
be
a
staple
of
mine
but
i
rated
it
so
high
because
well
its
one
of
the
best
for
the
style
first
comes
the
standard
pumpkincinnamonnutmeg
flavor
but
immediately
following
and
balancing
the
sweetness
is
a
roasty
dark
malt
almost
a
brown
ale
flavor
very
drinkable
due
to
the
subdued
pumpkin
spice
flavor
mouthfeel
is
great
due
to
the
carbonation
also
according
to
the
bottled
on
date
the
beer
is
about
2
weeks
old
could
drink
a
few
but
sharing
a
4
pack
so
2
is
it
drinkability
its
not
bad
sweet
and
spicy
is
what
your
looking
at
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
this
is
my
first
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
it
is
kind
of
syrupy
though
and
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
it
with
pumpkin
pie
overall
kinda
wish
the
name
was
punkin
spice
instead
of
implying
youre
going
to
have
some
pie
like
characteristics
first
pumpkin
ale
but
i
already
think
others
will
reign
over
it
easily
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
and
light
this
beer
is
on
the
sweet
side
not
bitter
all
spicy
very
sharp
and
carbonated
really
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
and
the
extra
abv
is
a
nice
addition
the
tangy
spicy
dark
sugary
sweetness
of
this
beer
is
really
alluring
i
wish
i
had
more
of
this
as
its
very
drinkable
at
7
punkin
ale
is
not
something
youd
want
to
drink
one
of
and
then
move
on
to
something
else
you
could
get
comfortable
with
a
4pack
of
these
loved
it
a
milder
pumpkin
beer
very
nicely
done
plenty
of
character
and
balance
with
a
deft
touch
poured
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
and
good
lace
medium
amber
color
malty
and
spicy
aroma
but
not
over
done
ditto
the
flavor
body
is
good
too
with
good
carbonation
finish
is
nice
and
as
it
should
be
for
this
style
very
satisfying
not
a
session
beer
d
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
that
has
a
great
presence
of
actual
pumpkin
flavors
that
some
lack
its
a
great
example
of
the
style
good
stuff
i
would
like
to
try
this
in
keg
form
best
punkin
ale
i
have
tried
to
date
drinkability
great
beer
for
a
fall
evening
although
i
would
have
liked
more
pumpkin
flavor
d
i
would
say
this
one
is
a
keeper
the
higher
than
expected
alcohol
content
encourages
me
to
enjoy
one
per
session
but
this
is
one
that
i
will
keep
in
my
rotation
of
fall
seasonal
beers
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it
go
for
it
its
worth
it
drinkability
this
is
a
warming
beer
and
is
perfect
for
the
transition
of
fall
medium
finish
means
food
is
not
necessary
with
this
one
or
anything
to
cleanse
the
palate
12oz
brown
bottle
obtained
at
mckinnons
in
salem
nh
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
with
a
half
inch
of
off
white
head
that
dissipated
within
five
minutes
leaving
a
little
bit
of
head
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
scents
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
other
spices
to
me
it
smells
like
warm
homemade
pumpkin
bread
straight
out
of
the
oven
tastes
of
pumpkin
and
spices
graces
the
taste
buds
leaving
a
small
after
taste
of
the
nutmeg
a
toffee
like
quality
plays
in
the
background
of
the
taste
moderate
carbonation
one
sip
invites
another
very
tasty
ale
for
the
fall
season
i
love
dogfish
head
sam
and
co
make
some
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
applaud
their
creativity
and
passion
for
extreme
beers
but
this
isnt
going
to
make
it
into
my
regular
rotation
of
fall
seasonals
cheers
drinkability
is
good
the
spice
is
light
enough
to
keep
it
drinkable
and
very
tasty
overall
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
cheers
d
very
drinkable
brew
in
my
opionion
lots
of
malt
and
adjunct
flavor
but
still
a
light
to
moderate
bodied
beer
easily
kill
fourr
of
these
in
a
sitting
so
far
most
flavorful
pumpkin
ale
to
date
still
have
to
try
southern
tiers
imperial
pumpking
drinkability
is
also
great
some
pumkin
beers
are
too
boozy
over
spiced
or
water
thin
dfh
nailed
this
one
it
looks
really
good
very
dark
amber
color
to
it
it
might
just
be
my
nose
but
i
didnt
really
find
too
much
aroma
to
it
it
had
a
great
taste
something
did
come
across
as
maybe
too
much
and
i
think
that
was
the
nutmeg
great
mouthfeel
heavy
enough
to
feel
its
character
but
not
to
heavy
and
very
drinkable
cheers
drinkability
i
could
definitely
knock
a
few
back
thats
for
sure
im
sure
the
fact
that
i
had
this
on
tap
helped
my
cause
a
bit
too
this
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
clear
orange
amber
with
not
much
head
but
that
may
be
a
result
of
the
way
it
was
poured
rich
aroma
is
mainly
of
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
with
a
malty
undertone
flavor
is
mostly
pumpkin
with
a
cinnamon
undertone
but
there
is
enough
malt
so
you
know
this
is
beer
texture
is
fairly
smooth
fizzy
and
pleasing
final
thoughts
this
beers
is
actaully
a
little
surpising
the
nose
is
really
spiced
but
the
flavors
has
sweet
brown
sugar
pumpkin
very
light
on
the
spice
and
not
really
and
bad
or
off
flavors
good
for
dfh
againits
got
great
drinkability
and
very
refreshing
another
fine
dfh
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
i
havent
had
many
pumpkin
ales
but
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
richer
if
you
want
a
perfectly
balanced
pumpkin
ale
this
is
it
alot
of
others
use
too
much
spice
and
not
enough
pumpkin
or
too
much
pumpkin
and
barely
any
spice
this
is
an
exceptionaly
balanced
flavored
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
2
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
as
expected
for
the
stle
of
beer
original
smell
is
of
pumpkin
pie
mouthfeel
is
smooth
slightly
clovy
with
a
taste
of
cinnamon
and
finishes
clean
with
more
spices
and
pumpkin
coming
through
this
beer
is
even
better
if
left
at
room
temperature
for
a
few
minutes
after
taking
out
of
the
fridge
after
drinking
this
i
almost
dont
even
want
to
try
any
of
the
other
pumpkin
ales
i
will
be
buying
a
case
of
this
every
season
the
drinkability
on
this
particular
batch
is
quite
good
ive
not
had
punkin
before
but
its
not
overly
sweet
like
some
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
in
the
past
notes
while
not
being
blown
off
my
stool
by
this
beer
i
can
easily
say
it
is
a
very
good
brew
i
like
my
first
taste
of
this
style
and
can
say
that
i
will
be
trying
other
pumpkin
ales
this
fall
poured
a
crystal
clear
medium
amber
so
it
looked
sort
of
like
a
pumpkin
a
moderate
head
that
faded
quickly
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
not
that
strong
the
taste
was
nutmeg
and
sweet
the
feed
was
medium
bodied
oily
and
mildly
carbonated
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
drinkability
was
good
d
good
given
the
speciality
of
the
style
now
i
want
some
pumpkin
chocolatechip
bread
sugar
cookies
or
carrot
cake
to
pair
with
this
amazing
liquid
fall
second
verdict
soso
d
i
like
this
dont
think
i
would
drink
a
lot
but
if
offered
would
not
turn
down
still
a
little
early
for
pumpkin
beer
or
at
least
i
think
but
at
couldnt
resist
from
the
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
dark
orangeburnt
orange
color
has
a
one
finger
head
that
pretty
quickly
goes
to
just
a
small
head
that
is
barely
there
leaves
some
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
spices
and
pumpkin
right
up
front
pretty
typical
of
the
other
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
taste
is
as
i
was
expecting
pumpkin
and
spices
right
up
front
and
its
followed
by
that
familiar
dogfish
head
taste
really
good
taste
has
a
7
abv
which
isnt
high
or
anything
but
no
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
taste
really
easily
drinkable
of
the
few
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
this
is
up
there
maybe
as
the
best
ive
had
yet
overall
great
stuff
ill
be
picking
up
some
more
of
these
and
save
them
for
more
of
a
better
autumn

i
had
to
change
my
ratings
on
this
beer
its
thru
the
roof
in
everyway
this
year
stunningly
good
best
pumpkin
beer
out
there
by
far
drinkability
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
the
flavors
are
nice
and
perfect
for
a
cool
evening
that
is
starting
to
border
on
early
fall
while
i
dont
think
id
crave
something
like
this
yearround
it
really
is
a
great
seasonal
and
the
flavors
are
wellblended
and
dont
remind
me
necessarily
of
eating
a
piece
of
pie
but
really
add
a
nice
dimension
to
the
beer
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
and
imo
one
of
the
best
out
there
spend
the
8
99
and
enjoy
four
of
these
on
four
separate
nights
youll
come
to
enjoy
it
more
each
night
all
in
all
this
ones
up
there
with
weyerbacher
imperial
as
one
of
my
favorites
pumpkin
ales
another
job
well
done
from
the
dudes
over
at
dogfish
d
excellent
drinkability
not
too
much
carbonation
these
come
in
a
4
pack
but
i
could
have
easily
consumed
twice
that
amount
d
an
interesting
and
very
tasty
brew
perfect
for
the
start
of
fall
and
cooler
weather
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
one
again
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
the
spice
smell
its
quite
intense
then
there
it
the
taste
the
taste
is
quite
strong
of
brown
sugar
to
the
point
it
reminds
me
of
hagen
daz
five
brown
sugar
the
beer
is
a
medium
body
feels
crsip
and
bubbly
fairly
drinkable
not
sure
how
much
of
this
flavor
id
want
but
i
wouldnt
mind
a
few
overall
probably
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
to
date
balanced
with
good
flavor
and
a
crisp
mouthfeel
easily
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
if
not
the
best
it
does
wonders
paired
with
vanilla
ice
cream
and
cake
desserts
too
the
only
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
that
are
on
par
with
this
one
were
brewed
in
tiny
batches
for
onsite
consumption
only
its
usually
a
pretty
tough
feat
to
get
the
spices
and
pumpkin
mixes
right
on
the
large
scale
but
dfh
has
done
it
in
this
case
its
beer
first
spices
second
drinkability
fantastic
for
a
pumpkin
ale
well
rounded
overall
without
too
much
spice
currently
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
mouth
feel
a
medium
bodied
beer
slightly
high
on
the
carbonation
with
a
slight
alcohol
heat
but
very
creamy
finishes
just
a
tad
on
the
dry
side
with
a
lingering
pumpkin
spice
no
complaints
but
no
major
raves
either
cheers
drinkability
great
pumpkin
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
great
session
too
i
like
smuttys
a
little
better
less
spice
more
pumpkin
flavor
md
body
is
on
the
full
side
very
creamy
mouthfeel
alcohol
doesnt
have
much
presence
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
at
7
abv
it
packs
a
nice
punch
a
pretty
good
looking
beer
pours
a
color
thats
darker
than
amber
but
slightly
lighter
than
tea
with
excellent
clarity
doesnt
really
have
much
of
a
head
there
was
very
little
left
by
the
time
it
was
brought
to
me
and
what
was
left
pretty
much
stuck
around
the
edges
had
far
less
than
average
lacing
but
all
in
all
looked
pretty
nice
the
smell
was
pretty
good
spices
from
pumpkin
pie
or
pumpkin
bread
followed
by
some
roasted
malts
im
not
really
a
fan
of
pumpkin
styles
beers
with
the
exception
of
cape
anns
pumpkin
stout
but
this
was
pretty
good
it
has
the
sweet
taste
that
you
would
expect
however
its
not
overly
sweet
like
most
pumpkin
style
ales
i
kind
of
wonder
if
there
are
roasted
pumpkin
seeds
in
this
brew
instead
of
the
sweet
pumpkin
spices
of
most
pumpkin
beers
it
actually
tastes
like
a
beer
as
well
not
like
it
should
be
warm
with
a
head
of
whipped
cream
topped
with
a
little
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
mouthfeel
is
good
no
carbination
or
alcohol
bite
at
all
id
say
the
drinkability
is
good
too
im
giving
it
a
4
instead
of
a
3
5
cause
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
it
was
way
better
than
i
expected
all
in
all
pretty
good
i
would
not
get
this
regularly
but
certainly
get
it
again
if
in
the
mood
and
given
the
opportunity
next
time
im
definitely
having
this
with
some
type
of
autumn
dessert
be
it
cinnamon
crumb
cake
apple
crisp
or
dare
i
say
pumpkin
pie
this
beer
pours
a
light
ambergold
color
with
a
thick
rocky
white
head
the
head
recedes
gradually
leaving
nice
thick
sticky
lacing
nose
was
of
pumpkin
predominantly
i
didnt
get
much
else
in
the
nose
taste
well
i
had
tried
this
beer
years
ago
and
didnt
like
it
second
time
around
far
better
taste
is
all
pumpkin
up
front
all
pumpkin
and
then
mingling
in
is
a
nice
cocoachocolate
taste
there
are
some
malts
present
but
not
picking
up
much
spicing
it
was
pumpkin
and
chocolate
and
it
was
good
medium
body
medium
carbonation
nice
thick
creamy
feel
on
the
tongue
a
beer
that
i
once
despised
has
now
become
nectar
of
the
gods
delicious
and
worth
the
wait
to
track
it
down
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
however
this
one
has
left
me
a
bit
disappointed
perhaps
due
to
it
almost
being
a
year
old
especially
after
being
very
excited
by
the
smell
i
will
definitely
try
this
again
and
see
if
i
feel
any
different
d
its
tasty
but
the
whole
thing
seems
contrived
like
some
sort
of
cheesy
holiday
beer
i
was
hoping
for
a
pumpkin
ale
not
a
pumpkin
pie
filling
ale
the
pumpkin
aromas
and
flavors
come
across
as
something
of
an
afterthought
in
that
respect
i
cant
give
this
brew
anything
higher
than
a
b
good
dfh
brew
great
pumpkin
brew
worth
trying
bring
some
to
thanksgiving
dinner
not
one
of
my
favourite
american
brews
and
yet
again
i
have
to
say
im
disappointed
with
a
style
of
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
to
like
have
i
just
had
bad
examples
something
tells
me
that
theres
a
beautiful
wonderful
pumpkin
ale
out
there
somewhere
unfortunately
this
isnt
it
am
not
getting
much
pumpkin
although
there
is
a
hint
of
spice
on
the
mid
nutmeg
i
think
while
there
is
a
noticeable
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
back
but
i
think
its
noticeable
mainly
because
i
wasnt
expecting
a
heavy
beer
from
the
appearance
and
smell
mouthfeel
is
quite
nicely
smooth
but
that
booze
hit
makes
me
recoil
just
a
bit
fairly
drinkable
i
guess
but
again
that
zing
marks
it
down
a
shade
bottle
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
decent
off
white
head
which
produces
good
lacing
has
a
delightful
aroma
of
pumpkin
brown
sugar
all
spice
cinnamon
and
a
touch
of
nutmeg
has
an
aroma
of
a
ginger
snap
cookie
just
smelling
this
one
gives
me
incredable
amount
of
excitement
the
carbination
is
soft
has
a
light
body
a
soft
duration
and
weak
finish
all
the
aromas
come
out
beautifully
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
its
a
wonderful
beer
gives
me
visions
of
good
halloween
deserts
im
slowly
becoming
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
bottle
aged
about
9
months
from
this
past
fall
unremarkable
in
appearance
smell
still
has
a
good
deal
of
spicing
to
it
but
in
the
flavors
the
spicing
has
been
mellowed
out
a
good
deal
by
the
aging
its
much
smoother
than
before
the
flavour
is
less
outlandish
but
it
works
here
mouthfeel
is
decent
straightforward
fall
pumpkin
beer
a
bit
watery
but
still
better
than
a
lot
of
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
the
extra
smoothness
adds
a
bit
to
taste
but
quite
a
bit
more
to
drinkability
it
doesnt
make
the
beer
spectacular
but
adds
a
nice
little
chunk
to
the
review
average
bottle
just
had
to
go
off
season
for
this
one
pours
a
darker
copper
color
with
orange
hues
and
a
nice
thinner
head
smells
like
fall
again
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
feels
great
on
the
chillier
night
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
rich
aromas
follow
into
the
palate
very
well
its
like
drinking
pumpkin
pie
but
not
as
rich
yet
malty
enough
for
you
to
believe
you
are
so
smooth
and
rich
decent
dry
finish
the
hops
have
subdued
and
mellowed
the
beer
out
perfect
winner
12

pint
glass
appears
a
clear
rich
dark
amber
color
with
around
an
inch
of
creamy
off
white
foam
a
minimal
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
with
each
sip
smells
and
tastes
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
such
as
nutmeg
most
dominant
cinnamon
allspice
nice
nutty
roasted
pumpkin
notes
toasted
grain
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
from
the
brown
sugar
maybe
a
bit
more
than
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
if
you
are
a
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
d
everything
gets
to
be
a
little
much
to
have
more
than
one
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
brew
decent
brew
all
around
i
have
backed
off
holiday
brews
for
some
time
this
makes
me
want
to
jump
back
in
this
has
to
be
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
i
used
to
love
this
style
a
few
years
ago
orange
veggies
are
a
favorite
of
mine
this
is
like
liquid
pumpkin
bread
with
a
cheesecake
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
worth
every
penny
and
drop
very
drinkable
after
drinking
so
many
porters
of
late
the
7
is
welcome
and
not
overpowering
drinkability
this
is
very
much
like
a
pumpkin
pie
i
love
how
you
get
the
sweet
first
then
the
hops
sort
of
like
eating
the
filling
then
the
different
taste
for
the
crust
this
one
definately
has
a
beer
feel
to
it
that
said
i
do
not
think
i
could
drink
more
than
two
in
one
sitting
drinkability
is
great
hides
the
alcohol
well
this
one
packs
a
wallop
of
spice
the
warming
feeling
feels
nice
but
the
taste
could
be
a
little
nicer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
mostly
white
head
smells
of
sweet
pumpkin
spices
like
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
there
are
malts
and
a
light
floral
hop
aroma
also
present
in
the
nose
first
sip
is
all
malt
and
spice
with
hardly
any
hops
noticeable
by
far
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
and
a
vey
good
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
this
on
tap
also
at
the
flying
saucer
in
fort
worth
i
have
to
say
i
liked
it
better
out
of
the
bottle
pours
an
amber
color
with
an
oily
thin
off
white
head
smells
of
cinnamon
pumpkin
nuts
taste
very
strong
of
pumpkin
come
other
spices
also
big
flavor
slight
alcohol
burn
in
the
end
med
bodied
fairly
thin
finish
though
this
gets
better
as
it
warms
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
and
slightly
dry
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
so
far
out
of
all
the
pumpkin
beer
this
beer
is
very
well
made
the
pumpkin
is
very
flavorful
bright
and
with
spices
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
like
eating
a
pumpkin
pie
and
drinking
a
well
round
brown
ale
kudos
to
dogfish
head
i
really
like
this
beer
d
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
a
great
fall
seasonal
and
excellent
beer
to
serve
on
thanksgiving
day
this
is
the
most
drinkable
pumpkin
ive
tried
to
date
and
holds
up
to
my
expectations
from
dfh
brewery
nice
with
food
too
definetly
recomended
probably
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
which
is
not
saying
much
as
pumpkin
beers
always
taste
like
farts
a
successful
attempt
at
a
gourd
beer
d
i
think
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
that
ive
had
so
far
it
has
a
good
enjoyable
flavor
perfect
for
the
fall
time
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
almost
brown
color
with
a
nice
cap
of
foam
which
settled
into
a
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
pumpkin
pie
sweet
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
not
as
strong
in
the
pumpkin
category
but
it
is
still
there
throughout
the
beer
starts
with
some
grainy
malt
while
the
spice
and
a
hint
of
hops
become
prevalent
toward
the
end
a
solid
mediumbodied
brew
not
overtly
pumpkin
in
the
flavor
but
that
is
just
fine
with
me
mouthfeel
is
middle
of
the
road
reserved
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
had
a
creamy
feel
that
tickled
the
roof
of
my
mouth
i
could
probably
have
2
of
these
at
most
like
any
other
spiced
beer
d
fantastic
beer
that
leaves
you
wanting
another
and
another
and
another
i
feel
like
i
need
a
little
more
spice
very
interesting
and
good
brew
but
hey
this
was
made
on
just
another
day
at
the
dogfish
head
brewery
one
could
only
imagine
what
could
be
next
pours
a
clear
brownlight
brownish
colored
body
with
a
huge
head
white
and
lasting
has
a
malty
spicy
aroma
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
weakish
though
has
a
nice
taste
of
pumpkin
light
malty
taste
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
from
the
look
of
this
beer
i
would
not
say
this
is
a
brown
ale
on
appearence
alone
smell
was
not
what
i
expected
nothing
pronouced
some
pumpkin
and
malty
background
hints
of
spice
taste
of
this
brew
was
pretty
well
balanced
with
a
sweet
malty
flavor
hints
of
pumpkin
but
not
to
overwhelming
it
has
a
nice
hoppy
background
as
well
creamy
texture
not
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
ive
always
wanted
to
find
a
decent
pumpkin
brew
but
everytime
i
seem
to
be
disapointed
luckily
this
by
far
is
the
best
one
i
have
tried
doesnt
taste
like
a
artificial
pumkpkin
soda
its
a
beers
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
pretty
decent
one
not
great
but
decent
give
it
a
try
but
my
days
of
buying
pumpkin
beers
are
over
im
not
sure
where
this
appeared
from
in
january
but
im
not
complaining
i
had
a
pint
lowhead
with
my
soup
and
pizza
at
liberty
st
tavern
the
hops
have
died
down
a
bit
since
october
but
this
is
still
about
the
hoppiest
pumpkin
ale
you
can
find
it
starts
with
big
pulpy
pumpkin
meat
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
which
is
followed
by
a
bitter
burst
of
citrus
this
isnt
the
most
complexx
pumpkin
beer
the
malts
never
really
came
out
but
id
say
its
the
most
balanced
and
certainly
one
of
the
more
pleasant
to
drink

t
d
high
overall
this
beer
is
by
far
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
its
unique
and
delicious
the
seperation
the
the
real
pumpkin
taste
and
the
spices
blew
me
away
great
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
university
of
texas
burnt
orange
with
a
ring
of
white
bubbles
for
a
head
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
aroma
more
veggie
than
spice
but
without
that
awful
burnt
jackolantern
that
some
beers
get
nice
spicy
taste
the
blend
gives
it
a
pumpkin
bread
flavor
versus
the
expected
pumpkin
pie
more
grain
and
some
caramel
malt
show
through
first
pumpkin
ale
that
has
an
ale
flavor
to
it
a
tad
metallic
at
times
but
easily
dismissed
lower
carbonation
enhances
the
flavor
nice
beer
id
definitely
drink
this
again
i
wish
it
were
more
readily
available
not
as
much
of
a
spice
bomb
as
i
expected
from
the
nose
and
more
like
a
spiced
brown
ale
than
a
typical
pumpkin
ale
quite
drinkable
and
certainly
one
to
try
if
you
like
the
style

drinkability
i
really
like
this
offering
from
dfh
its
a
shame
that
there
isnt
much
pumpkin
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
beer
pours
a
light
copper
and
has
a
decent
head
which
dissapates
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
strong
of
malt
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
spices
the
taste
is
of
pumpkin
pie
with
heavy
nutmeg
this
beer
is
a
good
beer
for
the
season
it
is
intended
i
wouldnt
say
this
would
be
a
regular
year
round
type
of
beer
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
the
drinkability
is
fine
and
it
pairs
well
with
the
thanksgiving
turkey
cheers
this
is
probably
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
12
oz
bottle
amber
pour
with
a
thin
off
white
head
nice
lacing
despite
a
somewhat
medium
to
thin
mouthfeel
aroma
of
nutmeg
other
spices
and
surprise
pumpkin
taste
of
malt
and
pumpkin
with
alcohol
present
lingering
finish
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
but
this
was
pretty
good
a
fine
beer
to
have
on
hand
in
the
fall
or
holidays
even
your
non
beer
drinking
aunt
or
brother
in
law
might
like
it
the
mouth
feel
is
what
really
makes
this
one
of
my
favorite
beers
aside
from
that
aftertaste
smoother
than
melted
butter
and
very
creamy
the
texture
does
not
command
too
much
of
you
and
it
glides
right
down
pours
light
brown
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
lots
of
brown
sugar
and
ginger
pumpkin
flavor
sweet
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
some
stinging
alcohol
there
also
which
is
uncharacteristic

this
is
an
excellent
winter
beer
perfect
for
the
holodays
it
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
nice
frothy
sticky
head
that
about
1
finger
also
has
decent
lacing
as
for
the
aroma
spices
spices
and
more
spices
there
are
hints
of
hops
citrus
and
pumpkin
but
boy
are
ther
spices
as
for
the
taste
here
we
go
it
starts
out
with
the
taste
of
hops
and
citrus
and
finishes
with
the
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
absolutely
delicious
with
thanksgiving
dinner
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
a
must
try
in
my
opinion
a
few
friends
of
mine
had
a
pumpkin
beer
tasting
with
16
different
pumpkin
beers
and
punkin
tied
for
first
not
too
shabby
amber
orange
crystal
clear
with
a
big
frothy
head
that
has
solid
retention
rings
of
lacing
as
it
falls
slowly
to
a
ring
during
consumption
smell
is
quite
large
and
full
of
well
pumpkin
its
pumpkin
pie
no
doubt
amazingly
it
has
scent
similar
to
a
crust
of
the
pie
as
well
with
its
bready
doughy
characteristic
some
light
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
taste
has
a
bit
much
cinnamon
for
me
its
pretty
harsh
up
front
there
is
still
some
brown
sugar
and
other
spices
far
from
what
i
picked
up
in
the
nose
in
terms
of
balance
its
here
and
there
with
the
flavors
never
balancing
them
as
one
but
showcasing
them
seemingly
one
at
a
time
cinnamon
up
front
for
sure
along
with
other
spices
a
little
sugary
sweetness
and
bready
finish
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
smooth
light
dryness
in
the
finish
maybe
from
the
spice
the
aftertaste
brings
memories
of
the
crust
which
isnt
as
apparent
in
the
initial
flavor
damn
if
only
this
lived
up
to
the
nose
still
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
by
any
means
its
kind
of
big
i
would
enjoy
one
at
a
time
but
more
than
that
is
just
too
much
pours
a
cloudy
amberorange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
sugar
cane
nice
amount
of
spice
to
balance
out
the
pumpkin
flavoring
resulting
in
less
of
a
pumpkin
taste
than
i
would
have
liked
overall
a
pretty
good
seasonal
beer
hv
d
i
take
my
hat
off
for
the
boys
at
dogfish
again
just
when
you
think
they
will
always
go
for
the
extreme
beer
and
assault
you
with
multiple
spices
and
bang
this
is
a
more
relaxed
and
low
key
version
still
quike
pumpkiny
in
flavor
but
a
great
variation
of
the
style
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
brew
but
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
id
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
to
see
if
any
different
golden
amber
crisp
clear
with
a
white
head
lace
smell
of
spice
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
mainly
pumpkin
seed
taste
is
herbal
with
hardy
earth
the
cinnamon
is
nice
the
nutmeg
is
a
bit
much
malt
is
buttery
follow
through
with
a
mild
hop
would
like
to
see
more
malt
bonding
with
the
pumpkin
like
that
this
isnt
a
sweet
beer
though
definitely
more
a
season
though
with
the
amount
of
herbal
qualities
this
has
a
truly
terrific
beer
great
for
the
holidays
definitely
on
the
pricey
side
51
bones
or
socase
but
worth
it
taste
had
a
great
pumpkin
flavor
go
figure
with
a
nice
little
alcoholic
zing
without
being
too
much
or
overpowering
the
spices
shine
through
more
in
the
aroma
than
in
the
taste
itself
which
provides
a
nice
compliment
and
balance
to
the
pumpkin
flavor
the
mouth
gets
a
little
splash
of
carbonation
ast
the
pumpkin
flavor
spreads
throughout
the
entire
mouth
while
i
liked
the
beer
its
not
once
i
would
drink
often
even
if
it
was
a
year
round
brew
it
drank
well
though
overall
drinkability
was
good
fairly
crisp
and
mildly
bitter
a
vast
improvement
compared
with
most
other
beers
of
the
style
though
i
think
id
still
rank
elysians
night
owl
ahead
of
it
im
thinking
a
headtohead
of
both
beers
might
be
interesting
accompanying
a
boycott
of
other
pumpkin
beers
available
in
this
area
as
they
are
generally
unimpressive
overall
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
so
long
i
like
it
but
i
wish
it
was
a
little
better
i
think
i
can
say
that
about
all
the
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
i
guess
it
is
the
style
then
i
think
i
like
the
idea
of
pumpkin
ales
more
than
the
actual
beer
but
as
far
as
this
beer
goes
i
think
its
pretty
good
and
a
top
one
of
the
style
but
if
im
not
in
the
mood
i
would
much
rather
another
one
from
dfh
this
is
a
terrific
autumn
brew
the
spices
are
prominent
but
not
overpowering
and
the
sweetness
is
rich
but
not
cloying
the
pumpkin
flavor
meshes
well
with
the
dogfish
head
note
i
tried
to
describe
above
i
do
find
the
alcohol
to
be
slightly
hot
and
id
love
to
try
a
version
of
this
beer
that
falls
between
5
5
and
6
taste
is
pumpkin
with
a
sweet
cinnamony
sugar
finish
body
and
mouthfeel
are
light
bottle
thanks
to
zathrus13
who
sent
this
beer
via
footbalm
thanks
man
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
medium
white
bubbly
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
pumpkin
notes
some
spices
and
a
bit
of
malts
interestingly
tha
flavor
has
a
large
hop
profile
along
with
pumpkin
and
loads
of
spices
the
finish
is
mostly
bitter
with
a
somewhat
offputting
alcohol
bite
not
bad
at
all
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
this
beer
is
the
epitome
of
all
things
fall
the
scent
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
brown
sugar
beckon
to
be
slowly
takenin
and
elicit
thoughts
of
halloween
cooler
weather
and
home
made
pumpkin
pie
it
is
a
must
have
for
a
fall
dinner
with
friends
sitting
around
a
campfire
or
watching
postseason
baseball
d
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
not
a
masterpiece
if
im
going
to
go
after
a
7
beer
i
want
a
more
pronounced
flavor
profile
thats
better
rounded
this
one
seems
to
be
a
bit
jagged
much
as
many
other
dfh
beers
are
but
also
unbalanced
would
i
have
another
after
this
one
in
my
drinking
session
not
likely
there
are
too
many
other
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
its
a
fine
balanced
pumpkin
ale
with
a
little
more
hops
than
expected
md
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
level
the
beer
was
creamy
and
smooth
and
i
could
have
had
more
than
one
i
will
be
having
this
one
again
the
deep
amber
ale
tasted
like
a
malty
version
of
local
apple
cider
until
a
wash
a
alcohol
made
its
way
into
the
moment
and
then
it
turned
into
something
resembling
barleywine
the
taste
was
the
reward
of
the
aroma
as
it
lingered
on
well
after
it
was
gone
it
had
me
dreaming
of
scenes
in
the
fall
great
ale
d
good
seasonal
for
a
cold
fall
day
probably
a
good
compliment
with
thanksgiving
dinner
d
it
would
be
easy
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
cooler
evening
not
a
bad
offering
from
dogfish
head
again
drinkability
very
good
spiced
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
would
go
well
with
any
cinnimon
or
spiced
dessert
overall
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
the
taste
is
very
wellbalanced
with
pumpkin
spice
and
malt
smells
and
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
highly
recommended
kinda
put
off
by
the
big
oak
flavor
and
the
bitterness
i
was
hoping
for
somthing
a
bit
more
sweet
and
desert
like
didnt
like
that
peppercorn
flavor
either
not
a
total
loss
though
at
7
it
should
warm
me
up
drinkability
very
very
drinkable
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
in
my
opinion
not
sure
how
many
i
could
drink
in
one
sitting
but
one
is
good
drinkability
still
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
in
my
opinion
this
ones
solid
across
the
board
tastes
authentic
its
wellspiced
and
its
not
overly
cinnamonish
as
many
pumpkin
ales
are
recommended
d
too
strong
for
a
session
but
incredible
taste
and
higly
enjoyable
bought
the
4pack
for
halloween
the
beer
had
a
wonderfully
festive
orange
glow
to
it
with
some
really
really
good
lacing
somewhat
thin
head
after
a
relatively
thick
orangeburnt
brown
head
laces
away
aromas
are
simplistic
and
general
than
seasonally
rich
has
that
cinnamon
hint
but
more
bready
aspects
sensed
still
packs
a
spiced
hint
taste
is
generally
sweet
with
a
burnt
spiced
bitterness
generally
well
balanced
and
crisp
but
definitely
more
desertoriented
thanks
to
its
sweetness
overall
an
excellent
pumpkin
ale
d
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
thus
far
it
has
a
great
balance
of
spices
and
hops
the
alcohol
is
there
in
the
right
balance
too
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
this
will
be
my
benchmark
for
next
year
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
but
like
always
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
an
actual
pumpkin
presence
aber
color
and
a
thick
tan
head
the
nose
has
some
sweet
malts
spices
and
subtle
pumpkin
the
taste
is
a
little
lighter
good
spice
presence
matches
well
with
the
malts
but
where
is
the
pumpkin
medium
body
goes
down
well
the
nc
beer
monger
is
a
fan
of
this
beer
this
would
make
a
great
trick
or
treat
beer
this
is
an
example
of
adding
pumpkin
flavor
to
a
great
brown
ale
as
opposed
to
just
highlighting
pumpkin
and
spice
well
done
nice
golden
orange
color
with
a
relatively
nice
thick
head
the
disipates
fast
a
little
astringent
in
taste
to
me
even
after
pouring
into
a
pint
glass
also
had
this
on
tap
at
one
pub
and
enjoyed
it
much
more
a
little
to
spicey
for
my
tastes
but
would
still
reccomend
to
try
it
md
the
mouthfeel
is
hurt
by
the
light
body
that
lacks
a
certain
pumpkin
bliss
this
is
a
great
beer
but
you
have
to
wonder
if
pumpkin
is
central
i
will
continue
to
enjoy
it
but
wont
say
it
is
pumpkin
central
mouthfeel
has
a
mild
creaminess
and
a
mild
carbonation
i
really
like
pumpkin
ales
and
this
is
a
good
one
i
believe
the
key
is
the
texture
and
this
one
has
a
good
balance
overall
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tried
and
certainly
is
in
line
with
the
balance
of
the
df
line
i
applaud
them
for
producing
such
a
trifle
and
wouldnt
mind
enjoying
one
of
these
now
and
again
in
the
fall
drinkability
smooth
nice
and
better
on
tap
than
i
remember
ill
go
for
this
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
gave
a
good
inch
half
foam
and
reduced
down
to
a
great
lingering
lacing
the
rich
amber
coloration
was
very
clear
aroma
of
spices
greets
the
nose
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
when
tasting
there
is
a
slight
sugar
malt
content
of
the
brown
sugar
aftertaste
is
that
of
the
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
low
hop
taste
drinkability
is
moderate
its
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
and
i
could
drink
it
again
im
not
wowed
though
i
love
the
styles
of
beer
which
i
drink
but
once
a
year
for
they
fill
me
with
nostalgia
and
cheer
mouthfeel
is
wellcarbonated
and
mediumbodied
sweet
clean
aftertaste
very
little
hoppiness
semidry
finish
very
very
drinkable
d
this
is
a
really
good
pumpkin
beer
from
dogfish
head
very
drinkable
i
just
wish
it
was
easily
available
in
socal
like
it
is
in
norcal
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
choice
for
fall
beer
drinking
poured
into
a
dfh
tumbler
murky
copper
with
a
pretty
fluffy
2
fingers
of
nearwhite
head
aroma
of
cinnamon
allspice
nutmeg
noticeable
hop
flavor
on
top
of
a
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
spicy
maltiness
rounds
this
one
quite
nice
hop
bitterness
evident
on
the
finish
drinkability
this
is
my
first
pumpkin
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
will
definitely
have
to
pick
up
another
four
pack
though
i
enjoyed
it
i
would
probably
tire
of
the
beer
if
it
were
available
year
round
now
that
i
have
tried
a
pumpkin
though
i
will
be
keeping
an
eye
out
for
others
i
finished
the
four
pack
in
one
sitting
i
prefer
weyerbacher
but
this
was
still
pretty
good
d
as
i
was
drinking
the
3rd
of
the
pack
last
night
i
was
struck
by
an
intense
nostalgia
for
fall
up
north
and
its
not
that
theres
really
anything
in
this
beer
that
reminds
me
of
specific
things
like
pumpkin
pie
or
mulled
cider
just
that
this
beer
tastes
of
fall
like
nothing
else
i
am
truly
happy
to
have
bought
it
and
highly
recommend
it
to
all
who
are
looking
for
a
little
fall
in
their
lives
medium
to
full
bodied
and
quite
spicy
i
was
apprehensive
about
the
pumpkin
flavoring
at
first
but
quickly
won
over
by
this
seasonal
beer
almost
as
if
youre
drinking
in
the
turning
of
the
leaves
i
havent
found
a
dogfish
head
yet
that
i
didnt
like
of
all
the
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
about
4
this
one
is
the
best
yet
and
i
will
certainly
be
buying
this
beer
again
im
looking
forward
to
pairing
it
with
some
holiday
dinners
in
the
near
future
overall
seems
like
a
novelty
but
a
good
one
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
orangeycopper
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
that
has
some
decent
stick
to
it
festive
pumpkin
pie
spices
hit
the
nose
first
nutmeg
and
allspice
mostly
with
some
actual
pumpkin
aromas
some
pie
crust
even
as
it
warms
more
pumpkin
in
the
flavor
while
the
spices
fade
into
the
back
a
little
fruity
esters
creep
in
and
blend
with
the
overall
sweetness
the
strength
is
evident
even
though
alcohol
flavors
are
not
really
a
problem
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
almost
rindy
bitterness
enjoyable
but
i
wouldnt
really
want
more
than
one
or
two
this
is
more
watery
than
i
would
like
feels
a
little
thin
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
robustness
having
said
that
it
is
still
quite
drinkable
even
given
the
higher
alcohol
i
like
this
d
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
but
certainly
better
than
most
the
cloying
aftertaste
leaves
me
wanting
a
full
crisp
beer
to
cleanse
my
beerdrinking
palate
pours
a
copper
color
little
head
and
no
lacing
the
nose
is
very
appealing
it
seems
like
it
has
a
nice
mixture
of
pumpkin
and
spices
it
looks
like
there
is
stuff
suspended
in
the
glass
its
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
for
a
pumpkin
there
is
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
taste
and
the
taste
is
not
as
good
as
the
smell
i
will
try
one
of
these
every
year
just
to
check
in
but
pumpkin
beers
no
matter
how
i
want
to
like
them
arent
my
favorite
style
the
taste
is
interesting
with
a
mix
of
leaves
bread
crust
pumpkin
spice
a
hint
of
alcohol
at
first
with
subsequent
flavours
of
burnt
pumpkin
and
toasty
raisins
its
lightly
sweet
and
zestyspicey
with
a
spicey
leafy
bitterness
in
the
finish
along
with
burnt
pumpkin
and
toast
its
quite
good
tasty
and
interesting
but
the
burnt
pumpkin
taste
gets
a
little
tiresome
i
think
i
made
out
a
little
better
on
the
trade
d
the
spices
though
bold
dont
get
in
the
way
of
drinkability
here
the
base
of
this
beer
supposedly
a
brown
ale
really
pulls
its
weight
enough
to
make
you
think
youre
not
just
drinking
perfume
the
entire
time
like
some
other
pumpkins
loved
this
one
try
the
weyerbacher
if
you
did
too
whether
you
like
pumpkin
beers
or
not
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
dfh
does
this
one
right
every
year
its
not
a
gimmicky
beer
like
so
many
other
offbeat
seasonals
this
years
seems
a
little
spicier
than
lasts
and
i
may
prefer
it
to
this
years
but
thats
a
close
call
id
like
to
see
a
bigger
version
of
this
that
would
age
well
drinkability
very
drinkable
its
a
bit
rich
and
slightly
heavy
but
a
very
nice
beer
the
taste
was
great
as
well
as
the
beer
is
clearly
bodied
pumpkin
good
ale
with
some
hops
and
finally
the
banquet
nutmeg
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
each
distinguishable
very
drinkable
and
even
more
enjoyable
outside
for
the
autumn
effect
given
the
heavy
texture
of
some
pumpkin
ales
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
it
was
medium
bodied
with
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
that
adds
just
a
bit
of
tingle
to
the
palate
as
you
sip
however
the
beer
is
so
rich
that
i
just
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
hence
the
lower
score
on
the
drinkability
medium
bodied
with
a
silky
mouthfeel
ive
only
had
a
few
pumpkin
beers
none
of
which
have
been
very
impressive
so
its
nice
to
have
a
pumpkin
ale
that
tastes
like
pumpkin
this
one
strikes
a
really
nice
balance
between
the
pumpkin
and
all
the
spices
this
would
be
perfect
at
a
thanksgiving
or
christmas
dinner
overall
a
very
good
beer
usually
not
a
fan
of
this
stylebut
this
is
one
beer
worth
tryingenjoy
after
dinner
or
while
carving
up
some
pumpkins
overall
impressions
during
the
late
fall
and
through
winter
i
normally
settle
down
with
a
nice
warm
apple
cider
nonalcoholic
from
the
local
orchards
but
this
might
have
jumped
from
a
chance
substitute
to
a
permanent
spot
in
the
starting
lineup
tied
with
brooklyns
dark
chocolate
stout
for
my
1
favorite
seasonal
this
is
a
good
effort
for
a
pumpkin
beer
i
had
this
beer
3
days
after
it
was
bottled
the
color
is
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
weak
head
the
aroma
is
of
nutmeg
and
definate
pumpkin
flavor
i
have
to
say
i
liked
this
beer
on
the
warmer
side
to
enjoy
all
the
flavor
a
good
pumpkin
beer
mouth
feel
sweet
but
medium
drinkablity
good
pretty
dark
amber
looks
with
average
sized
offwhite
head
smells
of
pumpkin
harvest
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
other
pungent
spices
the
taste
is
perfect
for
the
autumn
season
lets
go
for
a
walk
through
falling
leaves
right
now
pumpkin
pie
oatmeal
cookies
cinnamon
tickles
the
tongue
and
lingers
for
a
delicious
aftertaste
reminiscent
of
ginger
snaps
through
the
snow
to
grandmas
house
we
go
bottoms
up
notes
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
great
seasonal
beer
as
well
cheers
i
notice
that
some
people
compare
this
beer
to
southern
tier
pumpking
with
that
said
pumpking
is
still
the
king
however
those
two
beers
are
on
a
different
level
than
other
pumpkin
beers
this
offering
is
not
over
spiced
and
has
a
nice
pumpkin
presense
one
thing
i
noticed
with
this
beer
is
that
it
has
the
body
of
dfh
indian
brown
ale
in
the
taste
and
nose
very
noticable
burnt
notes
found
in
the
indian
brown
ale
very
good
beer
i
know
pumpkin
beers
can
be
looked
at
as
a
novelty
and
to
an
extent
they
are
but
i
welcome
the
novelty
this
is
pretty
much
the
standard
to
judge
others
by
dfh
punkin
is
a
fine
pale
ale
the
drink
is
perfectlycarbonated
fullish
in
body
and
plenty
pumpkiny
and
spicy
even
for
a
pumpkin
pielover
like
myself
superb
drinkability
good
pumpkin
ale
nice
to
have
beers
like
this
when
fall
comes
around
d
a
very
drinkable
punpkin
ale
and
one
that
will
certainly
appeal
to
fans
of
brown
ale
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
i
think
i
slightly
prefer
the
pumking
from
southern
tier
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
color
but
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
nice
scent
very
pumpkinish
with
pie
spice
although
its
almost
too
pieish
and
not
enough
aleish
nice
taste
same
with
the
taste
with
a
lot
of
spice
and
bit
of
hops
in
the
aftertaste
not
the
smoothest
pumpkin
ale
but
not
bad
its
worth
a
try
but
i
prefer
blue
moons
its
easier
to
find
cheaper
and
just
as
good
in
one
of
the
rare
cases
of
a
macro
being
just
as
good
or
better
than
a
craft
drinks
cleanly
strong
but
tight
what
a
pleasant
surprise
rigamarole
mediumbodied
but
with
a
thick
chewy
character
undoubtedly
imparted
by
the
inclusion
of
real
pumpkin
in
the
mash
despite
the
slightly
elevated
abv
this
is
a
wonderfully
delicious
ale
and
just
as
with
a
whopping
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
on
thanksgiving
it
leaves
you
aching
for
more
nice
dark
coppery
color
with
a
bit
of
head
smells
like
punkin
pie
and
tastes
that
way
too
i
usually
hate
flavored
brews
but
this
one
is
awesome
buy
a
twelver
and
pass
them
around
this
thanksgiving
yum
this
is
the
best
fall
seasonal
out
there
this
beer
simply
kicks
ass
double
the
abv
of
a
usual
pumpkinfall
seasonal
and
twice
the
taste
its
full
of
brown
sugar
taste
and
just
the
right
amount
of
pumpkin
taste
i
wish
this
was
available
all
year
as
it
really
is
just
a
good
well
balanced
beer
not
just
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
but
one
of
my
favorite
beers
ever
poured
a
clear
amber
with
nice
foamy
light
tan
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
light
pumpkin
brown
sugar
and
pie
dough
tastes
of
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
doughy
bread
pumpkin
pie
spice
pumpkin
meat
and
slight
alcohol
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
sweet
and
malty
with
good
spiciness
a
good
pumpkin
ale
with
not
too
much
spice
or
pumpkin
to
detract
from
the
other
flavors
very
well
balanced
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
definitely
among
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
out
there
d
a
decent
beer
but
those
phenolic
flavors
were
far
too
distracting
for
my
taste
ill
probably
have
it
again
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
as
well
as
a
very
relaxing
beer
you
can
definately
sit
back
on
a
nice
autumn
day
and
enjoy
this
one
just
pour
it
in
a
glass
as
it
tastes
better
then
drinking
right
from
the
bottle
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
you
wont
regret
checking
this
one
out
d
overall
great
pumpkin
beer
but
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
however
it
is
tasty
this
beer
poured
a
translucent
copper
with
a
fluffy
singlefinger
offcopper
head
the
scent
is
very
reminiscent
of
pumpkin
pie
with
some
sweet
pumpkin
and
spices
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
malty
sweetness
that
fades
into
some
pumpkin
and
spice
in
the
middle
but
just
a
little
the
finish
is
surprisingly
clean
after
a
little
bit
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
the
carbonation
helps
to
add
to
that
crispness
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
is
a
nice
balance
between
beer
and
flavored
beverage
with
a
hint
of
what
its
got
without
being
overpowering
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
at
all
i
liked
how
this
pumpkin
ale
relied
a
little
bit
more
on
the
pumpkin
that
on
all
of
the
spices
i
wouldnt
mind
another
one
of
these
d
a
good
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
great
in
the
early
autumn
cheers
full
disclosure
i
ordinarily
do
not
drink
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
several
over
the
years
and
have
failed
to
understand
what
the
big
deal
is
but
i
heard
a
lot
of
positive
comments
from
several
merchants
and
a
few
customers
about
this
ale
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
i
would
get
tired
of
the
pumpkin
taste
after
2
or
so
pours
a
nice
orangelight
brown
hue
head
is
about
1
12
finger
a
very
round
and
robust
flavor
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
sugary
sweetness
and
spice
flavors
the
pumpkin
flavor
hits
around
3rd
i
would
say
mouthfeel
is
borderline
sticky
but
just
enough
that
its
not
bothersome
a
very
interesting
beer
worth
a
try
but
not
a
beer
you
could
consume
in
vast
quantities
its
just
too
heavy
for
that
mouthfeeldrinkability
excellent
mouthfeel
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
and
the
beer
finishes
sticky
but
not
too
thick
i
think
this
is
a
fine
seasonal
beer
that
really
hits
the
spot
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
different
overall
a
very
good
brew
and
hats
off
to
dfh
for
tackling
another
offbeat
unique
brew
notes
wow
this
was
good
i
really
enjoyed
the
balance
of
flavor
and
judicious
spicing
which
gives
it
a
great
drinkability
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
fine
head
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
sensational
large
whiff
of
spices
brown
sugar
and
pumpkin
considering
the
smell
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
the
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
nutmeg
cinnamon
allspice
make
a
weak
appearance
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
characterized
by
a
big
alcohol
blast
the
7
lets
you
know
its
there
in
the
mediumbody
brew
and
there
is
a
very
dry
finish
overall
an
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
that
will
do
just
fine
for
autumn
great
beer
love
it
d
like
drinkin
punkin
pie
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
dig
this
one
mouthfeel
is
of
cream
carbonation
loads
of
flavor
everything
i
would
expect
in
a
pumpkin
ale
plus
more
booze
d
similarly
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
spicier
warmer
end
of
things
the
carbonation
is
relatively
light
but
thats
after
the
sodaish
fizziness
of
the
buffalo
bill
drinkability
really
only
suffers
because
i
just
dont
love
flavored
ales
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
dont
want
more
than
one
or
two
bottles
of
anything
that
tastes
like
a
dessert
than
i
dont
eat
outside
of
one
day
a
year
d
as
pumpkin
beers
go
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
not
surprisingly
the
aroma
is
the
strong
point
the
yeast
and
spices
compliment
each
other
nicely
the
spices
arent
overwhelming
but
they
dont
let
you
forget
what
you
are
drinking
the
astringency
in
the
finish
is
unfortunate
but
overall
this
is
a
fairly
well
balanced
beer
still
it
is
kind
of
difficult
for
a
pumpkin
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
i
only
need
one
of
these
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
not
much
alcohol
burn
or
warmth
and
no
bad
aftertaste
verdict
while
pumpkin
ales
are
nothing
new
i
knew
when
i
saw
the
neon
orange
pack
adorned
with
the
shark
icon
sitting
on
the
shelf
id
be
in
for
something
special
punkin
did
not
disappoint
without
a
doubt
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
themed
beer
ive
ever
tasted
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
dogfish
this
beer
is
lavish
complex
and
above
all
unique
these
are
the
kinds
of
beers
that
leave
such
an
indelible
impression
on
me
that
i
can
almost
summon
their
taste
just
by
thinking
about
them
brilliant
drinkability
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
d
i
had
this
after
shipyard
which
was
a
little
lagery
so
ill
take
another
run
at
this
one
that
said
seemed
to
grow
tired
of
it
quickly
due
to
the
pumpkin
and
slices
it
needed
something
in
balance
it
too
like
the
shipyard
was
amply
carbonated
so
a
bit
filling
on
that
front
too
overall
an
excellent
pumpkin
beer
my
favorite
to
date
something
to
look
forward
to
when
the
leaves
begin
to
change
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
before
i
bought
it
and
i
will
pass
this
one
up
in
the
future
in
favor
of
better
pumpkin
beers
picked
this
up
as
a
single
for
something
different
pours
an
orange
amber
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
smells
of
pumpkin
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
medium
body
nice
carbonation
and
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
the
taste
is
pumpkin
and
spices
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
one
but
certainly
worth
a
try
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
a
deep
orangeamber
color
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
and
nice
lacing
throughout
smells
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
like
pumpkin
pie
tastes
malty
up
front
with
sweet
cinnamon
and
spices
and
a
late
alcohol
bite
goes
down
smooth
despite
heavy
spice
flavors
has
mild
carbonation
and
almost
creamy
texture
that
finishes
crisp
i
would
recommend
this
since
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
could
not
envision
drinking
alot
of
these
very
low
drinkability
an
interesting
brew
but
excessively
sweet
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
the
nose
is
really
sweet
but
the
taste
is
more
dry
and
spicelike
this
beer
definitely
makes
you
think
of
halloween
as
you
drink
it
trick
or
treat
for
adults
deep
clear
amber
with
an
offwhite
diminishing
head
and
a
slight
chill
haze
aroma
and
taste
can
be
summed
up
simply
pumpkin
pie
the
moderate
caramel
malt
sweetness
leads
to
a
spicy
almostdrying
finish
light
creamy
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
viscous
mediumbodied
this
will
be
great
with
holiday
meals
a
musttry
fall
seasonal
d
not
bad
for
a
gimmick
beer
i
didnt
really
detect
any
pumpkin
but
it
was
pleasant
enough
very
tasty
and
interesting
brew
tastes
like
a
beer
with
some
pumpkin
pielike
spices
more
than
a
pumpkin
beer
which
i
like
drinkable
but
very
sweet
so
i
could
maybe
do
2
in
one
sitting
notes
not
bad
but
becomes
a
chore
to
drink
after
a
while
due
to
the
excessive
spicing
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
not
cloying
or
spice
overdosed
like
some
others
this
is
pure
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
its
not
something
id
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
times
a
year
but
with
the
holidays
approaching
quickly
im
saving
a
couple
of
bottles

a
strange
brew
indeed
that
misses
the
mark
in
my
opinion
of
what
a
pumpkin
ale
should
be
no
balance
whatsoever
and
had
to
drain
pour
interesting
many
of
the
dfh
unique
brews
go
this
unbalanced
route
for
me
since
the
dfh
90
minute
is
so
fantastic
seems
like
the
beer
was
trying
to
do
to
much
still
waiting
for
another
showstopper
from
dfh
besides
90
with
all
of
the
spices
in
this
one
i
would
have
to
limit
myself
to
one
or
two
of
these
while
they
are
a
nice
offering
the
spices
would
get
to
me
after
a
while
overall
almost
more
like
a
spice
amber
ale
than
a
true
seasonal
pumpkin
ale
worth
a
try
but
not
spectacular
certainly
the
tastiest
example
of
the
style
that
ive
ever
had
flavor
is
complex
and
satisfying
a
nice
brew
for
a
cool
fall
day
would
probably
match
well
with
a
thanksgiving
dinner
yet
again
dogfish
head
proves
itself
as
a
great
brewery
much
better
than
that
skank
pumkin
from
flavor
of
love
you
know
the
one
that
spit
on
new
york
d
fairly
drinkable
but
only
one
of
these
gets
the
job
done
for
me
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
interesting
use
of
spices
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
was
good
for
me
bottle

standard
dogfish

bottle
nothing
out
of
the
unusual
here
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
nice
shade
of
orange
decent

decent

the

is

pumpkin

spice
the
taste
followsmild
cinnamon
mild

faint

the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
somewhat
heavily
carbonated
the
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
a
solid
beer
overall
but
not
my
favorite
style
d
its
yummy
but
not
the
best
of
the
pumpkin
beer
lot
7
is
a
bit
high
for
drinking
more
than
a
couple
on
halloween
i
like
a
pumpkin
beer
i
can
chill
with
while
passing
out
candy
on
the
front
porch
could
be
tasty
with
fall
foods
like
turkey
and
mashed
potatoes
the
taste
is
quite
substantial
probably
the
highest
abv
pumpkin
i
have
had
and
not
loads
of
carbonation
or
efforvesence
the
beer
is
not
well
carbonated
a
bit
syrupy
and
quite
good
the
taste
is
a
nice
melange
of
pumpkin
allspice
nutmeg
vanilla
and
some
hop
presence
underneath
the
beer
is
a
bit
crisp
not
much
maltiness
popping
through
and
a
nice
flowery
hop
emerging
towards
the
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
pumpking
ale
although
there
is
a
bit
more
alcohol
presence
and
residual
abv
throatiness
than
i
would
have
cared
for
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
d
i
could
pound
these
back
and
not
even
think
twice
about
stopping
this
would
be
a
good
case
of
beer
to
take
tailgating
smells
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
tastes
the
same
the
beer
is
well
built
not
a
halfass
piece
of
crap
like
that
buffalo
bills
garbage
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
complements
the
sweet
spiced
pumpkin
flavor
very
well
carbonation
is
fairly
pronounced
cant
drink
too
much
though
or
id
get
sick
yet
another
solid
offering
from
dogfish
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
reviewed
on
09182008
110
am
overall
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
i
was
hesitant
to
spend
as
much
as
it
cost
on
a
4pack
when
so
many
other
pumpkin
ales
were
out
there
but
im
glad
i
did
be
sure
to
give
this
one
a
try
in
the
past
i
havent
been
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
probably
because
they
tend
to
lack
much
character
and
rely
too
heavily
on
the
spices
punkin
ale
on
the
other
hand
is
a
tasty
wellbalanced
beer
that
ill
definitely
seek
out
each
fall
md
medium
to
full
boided
and
very
creamy
smooth
fun
fall
beer
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
may
not
be
what
i
expected
in
terms
of
pumpkin
but
it
was
still
a
fantastic
brew
perhaps
i
just
need
to
get
another
bottle
and
give
it
another
try
drinkability
is
very
good
for
a
7
beer
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
great
session
beer
overall
i
like
a
pumpkin
beer
to
be
a
little
sweeter
if
you
dont
like
the
sweetness
of
a
lot
of
other
pumpkin
beers
this
is
for
you
it
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
strong
flavor
not
bad
but
i
prefer
some
other
pumpkin
beers
to
this
d
ive
had
much
better
pumpkin
ales
such
as
night
owl
from
elysian
deep
golden
brown
with
thin
head
and
little
lacing
nose
feqatures
pleasant
level
of
pumpkin
spice
and
a
little
ginger
taste
is
a
perfect
balance
of
spice
acidity
and
malt
mouthfeel
is
average
but
the
drinkability
is
killer
particularly
considering
the
style
again
due
to
the
balance
d
for
a
seasonal
this
is
quite
good
i
could
drink
a
few
this
is
what
all
pumpkin
ales
should
aspire
to
be
an
absolutely
delicious
beverage
fit
for
those
who
dont
even
like
beer
i
love
this
stuff
d
at
7
its
a
bit
heavy
though
the
alcohol
is
not
really
noticable
easy
drinking
and
am
glad
i
had
the
oppurtunity
punkin
out
served
in
a
becker
poured
a
brilliant
translucent
copper
with
a
1
5
inch
frothy
white
head
good
retention
some
watery
lacing
but
weak
legs
nose
presents
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
on
a
malty
backbone
pumpkin
flavors
revealed
in
the
taste
essentially
this
brew
is
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
enough
said
mouthfeel
is
between
light
and
medium
some
carbonation
present
but
a
pleasant
creaminess
comes
forth
in
the
middle
good
drinkability
for
the
style
flavors
are
not
overbearing
but
not
a
beer
you
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
in
a
sittng
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
to
date
good
job
dogfish
head
this
would
go
great
with
holiday
dinner
or
on
a
nice
fall
or
winter
day
a
four
pack
is
enough
i
look
forward
to
trying
next
years
release
however
ill
get
more
and
im
upset
i
only
bought
one
bottle
to
try
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
smooth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
another
winner
from
dfh
and
i
think
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
this
in
the
future
smells
right
off
the
bat
like
pumpkin
pie
and
brown
ale
very
nice
as
borat
would
say
i
had
this
brew
last
year
and
didnt
much
care
for
it
this
year
i
am
proud
to
say
that
i
have
come
around
on
the
punkin
ale
and
feel
confident
to
give
it
a
definite
thumbs
up
this
beer
was
top
notch
all
the
way
good
color
off
the
start
with
a
rusty
orange
and
creamy
head
there
was
a
lot
of
lacing
inside
that
glass
which
in
my
humble
is
the
sign
of
a
top
quality
beer
the
beer
was
full
of
pumpkin
spices
but
the
aroma
isnt
as
powerful
as
the
taste
the
taste
is
full
of
a
mix
of
pumpkin
pumpkin
spices
and
that
of
a
full
brown
ale
this
is
definitely
a
keeper
kudos
to
dogfish
head
d
a
little
on
the
bigger
side
and
thats
okay
its
somewhere
between
gratuitous
gulping
and
mindful
sipping
and
i
can
work
with
that
while
i
commend
dfh
for
their
experimentation
and
willingness
to
try
unusual
things
i
find
their
brews
to
be
rather
touch
and
go
to
my
palate
this
is
a
fine
example
of
an
experiment
that
went
the
right
way
recommended
drinking
overall
this
is
a
lighterstyle
ale
for
the
abv
and
the
spices
really
come
through
this
is
not
my
thing
but
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
idea
to
ramp
up
the
usual
fall
seasonal
its
nice
and
smooth
and
full
pretty
impressive
accomplishment
even
if
i
dont
love
all
the
spicing
thats
not
their
fault
but
mine
so
kudos
to
dfh
again
d
for
such
a
potent
brew
i
could
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
if
i
didnt
have
such
a
great
selection
could
drink
this
a
few
more
times
only
in
the
season
though
d
killer
autumn
beer
honestly
this
is
probably
the
best
pumpkin
beer
that
ive
ever
had
damn
fine
stuff
from
a
damn
fine
brewery
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
have
liked
something
a
little
heavier
richer
and
creamier
however
i
will
probably
grab
some
more
and
throw
on
some
misfits
or
samhain
and
celebrate
the
upcoming
halloween
season
compared
to
the
couple
others
of
this
genre
i
have
tried
it
is
still
a
great
beer
that
is
well
worth
the
time
easily
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
gotten
to
try
the
pumpkin
flavors
are
present
but
dont
make
the
beer
not
taste
like
beer
only
one
or
two
of
these
a
night
for
me
couldnt
drink
the
bar
closed
on
these
i
always
get
excited
by
the
delicious
sound
of
a
pumpkin
ale
but
my
expectations
are
never
met
this
comes
as
close
as
any
to
that
flavorful
imagined
prototype
alright
so
i
had
to
even
criticize
this
one
because
it
really
smells
and
tastes
great
pours
a
dark
reddishcoppery
color
with
no
haze
whatsoever
it
smells
and
tastes
just
like
a
pumpkin
pie
and
is
deliciousno
doubt
about
it
however
i
really
wish
that
the
thing
would
have
a
heavier
body
it
felt
pretty
thin
in
the
mouth
and
going
down
and
i
really
like
a
holidayspiced
ale
that
youve
gotta
chew
on
if
they
could
do
this
without
jeopardizing
any
other
features
of
the
brew
it
would
be
perfect
delicious
nonetheless
though
and
ill
definitely
have
it
again
heavy
carbonation
led
to
a
receeding
twofinger
head
that
sat
on
top
of
a
transparent
auburn
gold
i
thought
the
actual
pumpkin
smell
itself
was
mild
but
there
was
a
good
sweet
smell
of
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
a
great
pumpkin
taste
describes
this
beer
with
a
real
smooth
creamy
body
mix
in
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
for
a
spicy
kick
and
the
sugar
for
some
sweetness
dont
forget
the
spicy
crisp
dry
backbite
from
the
hops
that
complemented
this
beer
my
only
problem
was
its
lightness
and
great
taste
i
drank
it
too
fast
a
possible
second
to
sts
pumpking
still
a
grat
pumpkin
beer
copper
with
an
orange
glow
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
chalice
light
lacing
nice
cinnamon
aromatic
fresh
vegetal
hops
in
the
nose
nutmeg
cinnamon
squash
and
raisin
follow
through
the
palate
surprisingly
low
in
carbonation
but
the
bite
of
the
hops
on
the
palate
enough
to
keep
the
finish
nice
and
fresh
one
of
my
favorite
fall
seasonals
d
i
was
craving
a
beer
that
would
make
me
feel
like
it
is
becoming
fall
outside
it
is
otherwise
hard
to
believe
that
in
the
90
degree
weather
we
are
having
still
however
on
a
rainy
day
this
beer
hit
the
spot
i
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
and
would
like
to
try
to
invent
my
own
brew
of
this
style
someday
soon
a
beautiful
beer
thats
also
great
to
drink
this
may
be
my
favorite
dogfish
beer
to
date
a
super
satisfying
beer
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
by
a
long
shot
i
loved
it
should
have
got
a
sixer
spices
kind
of
take
over
and
linger
one
of
these
at
a
time
is
enough
the
appearnace
on
1st
pour
was
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
good
head
the
aroma
was
full
of
malt
and
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
something
extra
maybe
pumpkin
the
taste
is
great
with
a
mix
of
malt
and
spices
the
finish
kind
of
lingures
inviting
another
sip
the
body
is
not
as
heavy
as
i
thought
it
might
be
with
the
pumpkin
in
it
but
it
is
very
smooth
an
excellent
1st
pumpkin
beer
of
the
year
d
a
great
brew
and
easy
to
drink
the
only
thing
that
maybe
holding
this
one
back
is
its
sweetness
but
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
one
or
two
d
a
well
balanced
seasonal
beer
if
you
enjoy
pumpkin
pie
and
pumpkin
flavors
this
is
one
of
the
best
ales
i
have
had
this
is
the
first
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
and
i
dont
see
how
one
could
get
much
better
definitely
one
of
my
new
fall
favorites
with
high
taste
and
high
drinkability
the
flavor
showcases
the
spice
mix
well
and
i
swear
i
do
realy
taste
pumpkin
the
allspice
and
nutmeg
do
a
great
job
stimulating
the
palate
with
a
spicy
tingle
caramel
flavor
but
not
very
sweet
with
just
enough
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
to
make
this
more
drinakble
than
your
standard
holiday
niche
beer
this
one
is
definitely
a
winner
for
holiday
meals
or
with
that
pumpkin
pie
probably
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
good
job
a
very
palatable
beer
but
one
that
only
seems
right
during
the
fall
months
festive
nose
and
taste
make
a
great
halloween
beer
this
one
can
get
me
in
the
spirit
to
decorate
the
house
like
a
graveyard
but
more
important
its
a
sign
of
the
great
fall
and
winter
beers
to
come
awesome
found
it
at
amity
wine
in
new
haven
ct
mouthfeel
was
stingy
and
watery
very
onedimensional
wont
get
this
one
again
d
definitely
drinkable
cant
wait
until
the
weather
turns
colder
in
texas
so
i
can
have
this
fine
ale
on
the
patio
with
the
cool
fall
air
blowing
certainly
not
a
session
beer
or
even
something
that
i
would
buy
many
other
times
of
the
year
if
it
was
available
but
quite
delicious
i
definitely
will
be
buying
this
one
again
next
year
d
its
really
a
unique
beer
with
big
pumpkin
pie
characteristics
dunno
if
i
could
make
this
a
session
beer
but
i
will
have
another
overall
it
won
me
over
happy
halloween
smooth
and
creamy
wonderfully
drinkable
medium
body
with
appropriate
carbonation
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
yet
to
have
ahhh
im
so
happy
for
this
as
the
fall
approaches
my
favourite
season
tends
to
coincide
with
the
release
of
amazing
seasonal
brews
pours
a
deep
amberish
colour
with
a
thick
head
that
disappeared
quickly
the
smell
is
the
best
part
spicy
cinnamony
warm
it
embodies
the
fall
to
me
the
taste
is
much
the
same
some
people
trying
this
with
me
found
it
to
be
too
spicy
and
thought
it
was
an
odd
flavour
for
a
beer
i
think
its
great
regardless
of
the
slight
bitterness
it
goes
down
smooth
i
recommend
this
highly
but
i
will
admit
that
perhaps
i
am
romantacizing
a
beer
too
much
punkin
is
technically
a
good
beer
but
im
not
so
sure
i
go
back
to
it
even
though
i
could
not
taste
much
of
the
alcohol
it
hit
my
by
the
end
certainly
not
a
chore
to
finish
but
does
not
inspire
repeat
visits
poured
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
my
glassware
a
brown
amber
with
a
foamy
slightly
yellow
head
nice
retention
of
the
cap
and
good
lacing
in
bands
slightly
sweet
aromas
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
all
spice
classical
brown
ale
flavors
highlighted
with
a
pumpkin
twist
pumpkin
first
then
toasted
malt
followed
by
nutmeg
allspice
and
cinnamon
all
at
once
bitter
malty
finish
reminiscent
of
raw
unsweetened
pumpkin
rich
and
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
lively
carbonation
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
worth
tracking
down
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
or
something
different
i
suggest
aging
this
beer
910
months
as
i
had
i
really
dont
remember
enjoying
it
this
much
when
it
was
fresh
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
with
good
retenton
smells
of
light
pumpkin
pie
all
spice
nutmeg
but
not
too
overpowering
at
all
some
hop
spice
in
the
aroma
as
well
tastes
of
maltiness
all
spice
nutmeg
and
once
again
not
too
overpowering
on
the
spiciness
and
pumpkin
flavors
its
all
really
kind
of
meh
to
me
to
be
honest
i
dont
get
what
the
big
deal
is
with
this
beer
and
never
have
mouthfeel
has
lots
of
carbonation
medium
bodied
and
crisp
finish
one
is
enough
for
me
on
this
one
this
beer
is
awesome
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
head
that
lingers
for
a
few
seconds
you
can
smell
and
taste
exactly
what
they
tell
you
is
on
the
label
cinnamon
brown
sugar
allspice
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
has
a
very
nice
malty
aftertaste
did
i
mention
this
beer
is
awesome
probably
tough
to
drink
56
in
a
nite
has
a
slight
heavy
feeling
to
it
this
beer
is
autum
enjoy
it
while
supplies
last
pours
up
a
dark
pumpkinny
orange
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
a
very
warm
color
good
lacing
the
nose
is
nutmeg
pumpkin
spices
and
sweet
malts
the
label
is
true
to
the
taste
pumpkin
brown
sugar
cinnamon
the
works
also
some
sweet
malts
and
crisp
hops
medium
body
medium
carbo
i
put
this
fall
time
beer
up
there
with
avery
twelve
the
one
negative
i
had
was
tasting
the
alcohol
its
high
and
7
but
other
beers
i
have
had
have
a
fuller
flavor
that
covers
the
high
abv
but
this
doesnt
take
away
from
the
positives
that
make
this
a
very
yummy
seasonal
beer
d
autumnal
perfection
looking
forward
to
stocking
this
one
for
the
holidays
d
had
a
12oz
pour
of
this
and
that
was
fine
i
love
my
pumpkin
ales
and
this
is
a
good
one
had
a
bottle
this
year
and
it
was
a
little
bit
better
everything
about
this
beer
just
screams
pumpkin
that
word
itself
could
really
be
the
entire
review
the
beer
is
the
color
of
a
pumpkin
orange
if
you
havent
seen
a
pumpkin
with
a
light
white
head
aromas
of
pumpkin
along
with
some
light
toasty
malts
the
hops
kick
in
nicely
in
the
flavor
along
with
the
you
guessed
it
pumpkin
adding
a
little
crispness
and
spicyness
the
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
medium
body
the
alcohol
isnt
overly
perceptible
in
the
taste
but
after
drinking
half
a
bottle
i
could
already
feel
it
at
work
the
brown
sugar
offers
a
nice
nutty
complement
to
the
pumpkin
as
well
this
beer
doesnt
go
overboard
in
any
direction
ie
pumpkin
pieness
and
id
almost
appreciate
it
if
there
was
slightly
less
alcohol
so
i
could
drink
more
of
them
in
sort
of
an
oktoberfestyfall
kind
of
spirit
but
overall
was
very
pleased
the
smell
flavor
mouthfeel
is
the
epitamy
of
anything
that
is
marketed
as
a
pumpkin
ale
this
is
fantastically
flavorfull
balanced
and
extremely
drinkable
another
classic
from
my
favorite
american
brewery
this
is
only
the
second
pumpkin
ale
that
i
have
tried
so
far
but
it
is
very
good
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried
from
dfh
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
on
the
market
definitely
a
stepabove
from
your
average
dfh
punkin
is
easily
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
and
leaves
me
wanting
to
have
another
some
pumpkin
beers
strive
for
straight
up
pumpkin
flavor
some
for
pumpkin
pie
and
this
fits
the
latter
quite
well
well
done
dfh
pours
a
nice
reddishcopper
color
with
ample
head
retention
the
smell
is
mostly
of
spices
reminds
me
of
a
candle
storegift
shop
in
the
fall
taste
is
quite
spicy
i
was
expecting
this
to
taste
like
carbonated
pumpkin
juice
but
there
really
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
pumpkin
flavor
jumping
out
at
you
its
nice
spicy
will
a
hint
of
pumpkin
in
the
background
pumpkin
is
much
more
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
drinkability
is
great
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
was
going
to
like
this
much
since
ive
had
bad
experiences
with
blueberry
flavored
beers
but
this
was
a
nice
surprise
its
not
an
overwhelming
pumpkin
flavor
theres
just
enough
there
to
make
it
enjoyable
this
would
be
great
for
a
fall
party
or
even
thanksgiving
dinner
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retentionand
just
a
bit
of
laceing
aroma
is
of
sugarspices
and
pumpkin
body
is
light
to
medium
and
carbonated
taste
is
rich
pumpkin
up
front
with
a
spicey
finish
hints
of
brown
sugar
through
out
one
of
the
best
i
like
pumpkin
ales
and
this
is
a
very
solid
one
even
if
drinking
in
august
seems
premature
classic
pumpkin
ale
appearance
orange
body
bubbly
white
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
spot
on
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
with
some
sweetness
the
taste
is
on
the
money
too
again
the
pumpkin
pulls
through
with
the
cinnamon
some
nutmeg
and
brown
sugar
the
alcohol
is
extremely
wellhidden
smooth
mouthfeel
seems
like
the
sort
of
beer
that
you
would
enjoy
it
the
more
you
had
and
one
of
the
few
pumpkin
ales
i
would
have
outside
of
the
season
7
is
damn
dangerous
though
d
high
simply
because
it
is
sooo
delicious
fall
is
my
new
favorite
time
of
the
year
although
it
is
only
mid
august
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
that
the
punkin
ale
was
out
for
sale
you
would
not
know
that
this
drink
is
7
as
it
maintained
its
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
taste
throughout
with
no
harsh
after
bite
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
overall
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
goes
nicely
with
a
pizza
although
alone
it
might
be
hard
to
drink
as
a
session
beer
d
drinkability
was
fairly
good
per
style
considering
its
high
abv
and
spiced
herb
nature
can
drink
one
or
two
of
these
but
pretty
pricey
per
four
pack
share
this
with
friends
around
a
campfire
on
a
chilly
october
night
upon
postdrink
consideration
i
think
this
beer
was
going
to
be
on
the
verge
of
going
bad
i
got
it
before
it
went
and
im
glad
i
did
excellent
beer
this
one
grew
on
me
with
each
sip
what
seemed
at
first
like
a
nice
novelty
had
by
the
end
of
the
glass
become
something
i
could
see
enjoying
on
a
regular
basis
nicely
done
body
is
an
orange
amber
in
color
that
doesnt
much
resemble
a
brown
ale
head
settles
to
an
inch
of
light
tan
fading
to
a
skim
in
a
couple
of
minutes
leaving
no
lace
nose
instantly
noticeable
with
pumpkin
and
spice
such
as
coriander
and
raw
veggies
and
then
there
is
the
taste
that
is
very
pleasant
depth
and
complexity
that
i
havent
come
to
expect
from
pumpking
beers
bold
mineral
based
richness
up
front
with
a
nice
hop
feel
to
balance
slightly
carmalized
malt
teams
with
the
spicey
pumpkin
tones
that
is
present
throughout
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
rich
raw
pumpkin
and
spicey
veggie
feel
this
is
excetionally
drinkable
for
the
style
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
taste
is
less
spicy
and
more
malty
than
the
aroma
suggests
fairly
balanced
when
it
comes
to
the
spice
but
in
a
way
it
seems
rather
bland
when
compared
to
other
dfh
products
t
medium
bodied
creamy
with
high
carbonation
like
the
smell
it
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
but
not
in
a
bad
way
strong
malt
body
biscuit
like
and
slightly
dry
im
a
little
late
in
reviewing
this
beer
and
it
isnt
nearly
as
good
as
it
was
fresh
so
im
not
letting
that
affect
my
score
this
was
slightly
more
sweet
and
less
dry
fresh
still
a
good
beer
but
not
for
sitting
around
however
the
7
is
still
very
noticeable
as
it
was
fresh
and
the
beer
still
tastes
slightly
hot
in
the
throat
all
in
all
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
stingy
dash
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
decently
hoppy
for
the
level
of
spiciness
that
it
has
overall
a
very
flavorful
beer
even
though
it
is
7
this
could
be
very
sessionable
on
a
brisk
fall
day
cant
wait
til
next
years
one
of
my
perennial
favorite
pumpkin
ales
although
it
might
be
too
spicy
for
some
i
find
this
recipe
sublime
beginning
with
the
smoky
and
woody
nose
the
taste
of
pumpkin
is
subtle
not
too
sweet
before
handing
it
over
to
the
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
conjures
up
images
of
autumn
leaves
a
roaring
fire
and
hot
homemade
pie
pours
an
orangish
brown
with
nice
off
white
head
some
good
lacing
pretty
nice
look
to
it
the
aroma
is
kind
of
shy
but
some
very
nice
spices
pop
out
pumpkin
obviously
in
there
too
the
taste
is
much
better
the
spices
even
more
tasty
the
pumpkin
more
dominant
and
the
malt
base
coming
out
more
maybe
just
a
hint
of
hops
toward
the
end
the
mouth
is
pretty
nicely
carbonated
decent
body
overall
pretty
nice
cant
say
this
is
my
favorite
style
not
by
a
long
shot
but
this
seems
to
be
the
most
authentic
shot
at
the
style
ive
had
in
a
while
and
thus
a
good
beer
to
try
in
my
book
d
a
good
easy
drinkable
beer
in
the
fall
pours
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
hint
of
orange
and
a
crème
head
that
falls
quickly
nose
is
of
very
muted
pumpkins
and
some
very
mild
spices
smells
more
like
pumpkin
pie
but
really
subdued
to
the
point
that
it
is
almost
nonexistent
flavor
is
smooth
with
brown
ale
attributes
and
a
gentle
amount
of
pumpkin
and
spices
mixed
in
smooth
yes
just
not
very
eventful
really
feel
has
a
mass
of
big
bubbles
of
carbonation
hitting
the
mouth
and
the
liquid
feels
good
too
very
drinkable
overall
as
easy
drinking
a
pumpkin
ale
as
you
are
going
to
find
crystal
clear
and
light
brown
big
white
head
with
big
pillowy
bubbles
in
it
no
head
retention
to
speak
of
though
smell
of
ginger
and
a
bit
of
pumpkin
taste
of
pumpkin
pie
and
beer
blended
together
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
and
medium
body
not
something
i
would
ever
buy
again
but
worth
trying
once
d
all
day
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
it
was
available
year
round
living
in
michigan
and
loving
to
grill
and
be
outside
as
much
as
possible
the
fall
is
the
last
hurrah
to
be
outside
before
massive
amounts
of
snow
set
in
fall
also
brings
with
it
a
plethora
of
seasonal
beers
including
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
many
pumpkin
beers
and
have
been
disappointed
with
each
of
them
however
this
one
is
a
different
story
the
clear
pumpkin
color
of
the
ale
coupled
with
the
intense
pumpkin
pie
aroma
is
a
world
apart
from
other
pumpkin
brews
the
taste
is
complex
spicy
sweet
and
and
roasted
like
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
well
suited
to
this
style
easy
drinking
as
a
dessert
beer
or
as
a
reminder
of
why
fall
isnt
such
a
bad
thing
highly
recommended
drinkability
this
is
a
first
rate
pumpkin
ale
dogfish
head
proves
they
can
make
an
excellent
beer
with
out
having
to
go
to
extremes
notes
not
too
bad
of
a
pumpkin
beer
im
glad
they
didnt
go
overboard
with
the
spices
like
a
lot
of
other
breweries
do
the
base
of
the
beer
is
nice
would
be
easier
to
drink
if
the
alcohol
wasnt
so
high
overall
one
of
the
most
welldone
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
nothing
is
over
the
top
and
it
fits
the
style
dead
on
pours
quite
orange
little
head
dissipates
quickly
light
aroma
of
spices
and
caramel
malts
flavors
resemble
a
pumkin
pie
without
being
cloying
and
sweet
fairly
balanced
beer
for
a
spiced
ale
not
overwhelming
d
this
is
a
bit
sweet
but
i
could
totally
have
2
of
these
when
it
was
on
tap
at
bsp
i
would
order
at
least
one
usually
by
far
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
though
i
havent
had
that
many
recommended
if
youre
looking
for
a
pumpkin
beer
despite
the
season
being
nearly
over
drinkability
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
id
want
something
different
after
two
of
these
in
a
session
but
then
maybe
this
would
go
better
with
dessert
pours
a
nearly
brilliant
goldenorange
in
color
topped
with
a
onefingered
medium
tan
head
and
decent
lacing
nose
is
spicy
lightly
boozy
and
lightly
tangysweet
inclusion
of
brown
sugar
is
evident
my
impressions
on
the
first
sip
are
of
a
sweet
smooth
and
moderately
fullbodied
brew
punchy
definitely
wears
its
7
with
style
light
notes
of
cherry
and
angelfood
cake
and
even
a
lightlyspiced
plain
cake
donut
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lightly
tangy
lightly
warming
from
the
higher
alcohol
and
with
remarkably
good
drinkability
leans
toward
a
dessert
beer
but
i
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
of
these
this
is
the
biggest
pumpkin
brew
ale
or
otherwise
ive
ever
sampled
and
yet
it
has
remarkable
balance
even
to
the
point
of
a
drier
finish
than
id
first
expected
id
say
that
this
one
might
win
over
a
few
of
the
people
who
havent
yet
warmed
to
the
pumkininabeer
crowd
as
it
really
brings
everything
together
nicely
the
pumpkin
and
spice
taste
is
really
upfront
in
this
medium
body
brew
when
it
hits
the
mouth
the
cinnamon
lingers
a
bit
when
the
malt
kicks
in
and
everything
finishes
with
a
dry
hoppy
bitterness
the
taste
of
alcohol
is
pretty
much
all
over
it
from
start
to
finish
not
too
overbearing
but
theres
no
denying
that
its
there
the
better
half
said
she
liked
it
but
had
her
thinking
that
someone
tipped
a
little
bit
of
a
nut
brown
ale
into
the
pie
batter
i
cant
say
that
ive
ever
that
i
recall
at
least
thought
about
having
a
doughnut
or
a
bowl
of
ice
cream
with
a
beer
before
but
entertained
the
idea
while
drinking
this
this
beer
gets
better
as
warms
and
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
of
the
season
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
well
done
dfh
poured
a
rusty
golden
orange
with
a
12
finger
head
the
smell
was
predictable
spice
especially
nutmeg
and
close
and
pumpkin
pie
both
the
pie
filling
and
the
bready
crust
the
taste
was
delicious
and
well
balanced
obviously
you
have
your
spice
again
with
nutmeg
and
clove
but
maybe
some
cinnamon
in
there
plenty
of
sweet
caramel
malts
but
also
a
tangy
dry
finish
to
provide
the
slightest
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
im
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
i
always
look
forward
to
the
fall
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
its
certainly
more
complex
and
much
less
overthetopsweet
as
many
of
the
other
pumpkins
out
there
d
nice
seasonal
for
the
autumn
months
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
these
all
night
but
id
definitely
pick
up
a
4pack
of
these
next
fall
drinkability
i
had
big
hopes
for
this
one
but
its
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
its
tasty
but
a
bit
cloying
and
i
really
wish
there
was
more
spice
in
the
taste
the
nose
was
fantastic
though
and
i
wish
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
thanks
again
to
yonderwonderer
a
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
not
the
prettiest
or
best
ive
had
but
a
very
nice
one
this
would
be
a
great
sipper
during
the
chill
of
autumn
as
well
as
would
be
nice
with
some
cheddar
or
some
lively
mediterranean
rim
fare
id
definitely
make
this
a
part
of
my
autumnal
beer
enjoyment
definitely
recommended
if
you
like
a
nice
spiced
ale
i
would
have
rated
even
higher
but
the
finish
seemed
short
and
a
little
stale
overall
though
a
nice
twist
and
even
though
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
herbvegetable
beers
this
was
an
enjoyable
offering
from
dfh
the
pumkin
taste
resided
on
my
pallette
long
after
the
beer
was
done
and
alothough
it
was
quite
a
heavy
and
layered
beer
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
one
or
two
more
it
was
truly
a
well
done
beer
in
perfect
balance
and
in
overall
craft
d
all
and
all
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
though
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
more
then
2
at
anygiving
setting
d
the
7
abv
comes
through
a
bit
too
much
ere
and
kills
the
flavor
party
wouldnt
be
able
to
polish
off
more
then
one
of
these
overall
though
i
like
some
overlyspiced
versions
of
the
style
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
it
kept
the
integrity
of
the
base
beer
while
the
pumpkin
and
spice
made
for
additional
flavor
the
punkin
ale
seems
to
be
one
of
those
beers
that
i
try
and
try
with
each
year
to
love
and
it
just
never
happens
just
way
too
over
spiced
with
not
enough
pumpkin
and
a
unnecessaryly
high
7
abv
make
this
a
one
time
a
fall
beer
for
me
if
they
want
to
keep
the
high
abv
they
should
make
this
an
imperial
style
and
ramp
up
the
flavor
too
another
excellent
fall
installment
from
the
brewers
at
dogfish
head
i
had
a
chance
to
sample
some
of
the
first
batches
this
summer
at
the
milton
brewery
but
it
never
tasted
better
as
it
does
at
the
end
of
the
line
and
out
of
my
fridge
on
this
halloween
night
almost
makes
me
want
to
sip
another
and
wait
for
the
great
pumpkin
if
you
are
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
and
allspice
im
sure
you
could
session
this
beer
but
i
think
it
needs
more
of
a
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
flavor
to
be
a
fallwinter
choice
for
me
note
to
self
ranked
16
pumpkin
ale
when
i
tried
it
so
to
the
beer
good
color
nice
dark
brown
sugar
color
with
decent
glass
lacing
hints
of
brown
sugar
molassess
and
cloves
in
the
nose
the
beer
folks
is
nuanced
it
will
not
give
you
the
pumpkin
pie
effect
more
the
effect
is
a
good
hoppy
ale
giving
credence
to
the
season
and
time
the
pumpkin
taste
as
well
as
aroma
is
subtle
and
is
meant
to
be
subtle
to
compliment
the
hops
character
i
find
that
this
exudes
a
great
balanace
to
this
beer
i
wonder
what
the
hops
are
still
have
not
been
able
to
figure
that
out
because
that
is
subtle
as
well
but
definitely
presistant
present
look
at
this
beer
as
a
hopped
brown
ale
with
pumpkin
overtones
that
i
feel
are
consistenlty
present
from
first
sip
through
taste
and
finish
if
you
can
approach
that
way
and
like
hops
you
will
defintely
enjoy
this
beer
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
enjoy
raking
leaves
or
chopping
wood
in
my
house
this
is
one
of
our
standard
thanksgiving
fare
great
beer
enjoy
and
thanks
to
dogfish
for
keeping
it
a
bit
off
center
but
still
wonderfully
excellent
i
think
that
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
and
will
drink
the
4
no
problem
but
not
worth
the
money
i
would
say
i
enjoy
their
other
beers
much
more
the
departure
from
the
12
ounce
bottle
produces
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
stupendous
off
white
creamy
head
that
last
longer
than
the
energizer
bunny
lacing
is
a
solid
sheet
which
circumnavigates
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
with
pumpkin
and
spices
like
cinnamon
and
ginger
and
a
touch
of
vanilla
quite
a
treat
for
the
old
schnozzle
start
has
a
nice
pumpkin
and
malt
sweetness
light
bitterness
at
the
back
top
is
light
to
medium
in
feel
finish
continues
the
sweet
malt
and
spicy
taste
the
acidity
plausible
aftertaste
sweet
and
tart
a
fine
beer
d
yummy
but
its
rich
and
alcohol
is
a
little
heavy
at
7
percent
not
that
youd
notice
from
a
taste
a
couple
in
one
sitting
is
plenty
for
me
still
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
the
gold
standard
for
pumpkin
beer
rest
is
all
disappointing
aroma
is
of
weak
pumpkin
and
clove
taste
trys
to
make
it
but
lacks
any
real
commitment
to
the
punk
this
is
just
a
brown
with
some
spices
thrown
in
and
an
average
pumpkin
but
for
the
freaking
high
dollar
cost
13
a
four
pack

the
drinkability
really
lacks
local
beers
at
a
lot
better
cost
whip
this
ones
ass
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
only
a
thin
lace
of
head
carbonation
seems
on
the
light
side
aroma
is
quite
strong
i
could
smell
it
when
it
was
sitting
on
the
table
but
has
a
pleasant
clover
and
nutmeg
aroma
i
can
sense
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
in
the
taste
with
a
little
pumpkin
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonation
but
still
goes
the
the
throat
quite
smooth
and
has
a
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
d
far
more
balanced
than
the
average
punkin
the
balance
of
the
spices
pumpkin
and
malt
make
this
one
of
the
most
drinkable
pumpkin
beers
i
have
tried
i
would
reccomend
it
to
fans
of
the
variety
drinkability
this
is
becoming
a
fall
favorite
for
me
even
with
summer
still
hanging
on
here
in
the
south
this
reminds
me
that
cooler
weather
is
on
the
way
d
i
feel
done
after
only
a
few
sips
not
a
drinkable
brew
by
any
means
but
not
hard
to
get
down
poured
the
12
oz
bottle
into
a
brandy
snifter
poured
with
a
fairly
small
head
which
settled
quickly
nice
clear
amber
slight
brown
color
it
definetly
had
various
aromas
associated
with
pumpkin
cinnamon
allspice
nutmeg
along
with
a
noticeable
yeast
aroma
good
flavors
but
the
pumpkin
qualities
seemed
to
be
clashing
with
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
a
real
pumpkin
flavor
was
noticed
in
the
aftertaste
however
nice
body
with
adequate
carbonation
quite
drinkable
no
major
complaints
brew
pored
to
a
amber
color
with
a
smallish
medium
tan
head
that
had
retention
through
half
of
the
beer
but
left
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aromas
are
nice
possible
because
i
have
had
a
number
of
other
pumpkin
brews
this
one
does
not
seem
to
be
in
your
face
the
aromas
are
of
your
typical
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
very
smooth
again
no
one
flavor
is
really
sticking
out
but
seems
to
have
a
nice
marriage
of
flavors
those
flavors
are
similar
to
the
aroma
but
i
think
a
malty
caramel
backbone
sticks
out
the
spices
seem
to
be
nutmeg
allspice
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
flavors
over
all
this
is
a
nice
drinking
brew
and
at
7
i
do
not
notice
an
alcohol
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
brews
i
have
had
to
date
d
a
great
example
of
the
style
this
was
the
first
pumpkin
beer
i
ever
had
and
it
holds
a
somewhat
special
place
in
my
heart
the
taste
perked
me
up
a
bit
as
this
punk
hit
fairly
hard
for
its
style
with
a
sweet
spicey
body
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
bitter
hops
and
lots
of
spice
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
salty
and
crisp
across
the
palate
with
a
nice
bitter
bite
on
the
finish
it
begins
to
really
smooth
out
once
the
carbonation
level
drops
this
is
not
a
beer
id
look
to
buy
again
anytime
soon
but
the
complexity
is
there
for
its
style
its
decent
but
there
are
better
pumpkin
ales
around
d
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
look
forward
to
many
more
bought
as
part
of
a
sample
pack
otherwise
i
would
have
easily
been
able
to
drink
several
even
though
a
bit
stronger
than
most
pumpkins
overall
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
tried
this
season
this
is
the
best
of
the
punkin
ales
out
there
that
ive
tried
not
to
mention
the
good
buzz
7
per
bottle
the
only
down
is
that
in
my
area
the
cost
is
8
99
if
it
came
in
a
sixpack
it
only
comes
in
four
might
be
because
of
alcohol
content
laws
in
tx
the
price
would
make
it
easier
to
have
around
the
house
more
often
not
nearly
as
good
as
southern
tiers
imperial
pumking
or
weyerbackers
imperial
pumpkin
ale
but
better
than
many
ive
had
certainly
worth
a
try
this
autumn
overall
thanks
himerman
for
sending
me
this
beer
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
it
while
not
my
favorite
dogfish
head
beer
or
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
i
still
liked
this
one
a
great
chilly
fall
day
beer
without
a
doubt
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
o
its
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
i
just
cant
force
myself
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
with
all
the
spice
beer
pours
a
nice
orangebrown
and
keeps
a
longlasting
head
of
14
or
so
the
smell
is
a
slight
pumpkin
with
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg

pretty
wellbalanced
pumpkin
beer
i
think
i
like
it
a
little
better
than
the
cottonwood
one
nutmeg
cinnamon
a
bit
of
malt
but
very
little
pumpkin
i
found
it
the
pimpkin
hard
to
find
taste
matches
the
aroma
where
is
the
pumpkin
i
was
hoping
for
a
gritty
earthy
tone
of
the
pumpkin
to
complement
the
spices
but
was
let
down
medium
body
and
carbonation
drinkability
is
great
if
youre
into
spiced
beers
but
as
for
a
pumpkin
beer
goesthere
are
betterstubbie1sep

but
this
is
often
the
case
in
pumpkin
ales
and
doesnt
really
bother
me
its
by
no
means
an
overspiced
mess
my
one
real
complaint
with
the
taste
is
that
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
hot
and
apparent
for
my
liking
overall
seems
floral
has
a
hot
flavor
from
the

level
almost
tastes

is

ale
typical
for

produced
by

alttrinkeraug

and
an
aftertaste
that
is
complex
and
endlessly
pleasurable
i
love
this
beer
its
use
of
pumpkin
is
nuanced
enough
to
allow
this
to
be
a
session
beer
although
its
seasonal
ginger
slightly
viscous
body
pumpkin
sweetness
to
start
an
good

for

give
me

i

there

5best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
yetsteinlifternov
06
than
most
other
pumpkin
ales
sorry
punkin
the
aromas
of
this
orangetawny
liquid
are
of
split
mashed
and
boiled
grains
starchy
and
beery
on
the
palate
it
is
creamytextured
and
admirably
balanced
between
bitter
malty
beer
flavors
reminiscent
of
a
runofthemill
amber
or
brown
ale
subtle
spiciness
and
gordflavors
can
be
decoded
from
the
experience
but
it
requires
some
effort
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
slightly
malty
scent
which
is
overpowered
with
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
very
smooth
pumpkin
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
a
bit
warm
it
has
a
complex
array
of
seasonings
along
with
excellent
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
pumpkin
ale
this
and
smuttynose
pumpkin
ale
are
among
the
best
love
me
some
dogfish
so
i
was
eager
to
try
this
one
perfect
weather
for
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
very
fluffy
head
that
doesnt
go
away
the
aroma
is
wonderful
nutmeg
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
pumpkin
smells
like
a
pie
as
it
should
the
flavor
has
a
subdued
pumpkin
flavor
that
is
backed
by
the
nice
mixture
of
spices
well
done
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
a
little
low
because
of
the
spices
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
lots
of
these
just
one
per
day
dogfish
scores
again
edit
trying
the
2004
batch
here
the
color
is
amber
gold
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
overall
a
nice
beer
but
not
as
exceptional
as
last
years
im
gooing
to
knock
the
appearance
taste
and
drinkability
down
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
heavy
given
the
stickiness
i
would
definitely
have
a
few
even
though
i
was
disappointed
in
the
flavors
ive
had
plenty
worse
but
there
are
better
out
there
mouthfeel
is
good
and
this
baby
goes
down
smooth
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
fall
evening
would
be
wonderful
drinkability
is
good
as
well
this
is
damn
tasty
and
i
could
finish
the
4
pack
in
one
night
if
i
was
in
the
mood
this
gets
me
in
the
fall
halloween
spirit
and
i
highly
recommend
this
seasonl
brew
to
all
dfh
does
not
fail
to
impress
me
yet
again
this
pumpkin
ale
looks
and
smellls
better
than
it
tastes
being
a
pumpkin
lover
i
was
hoping
for
a
pumpkin
flavor
but
it
really
was
not
present
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
taste
is
not
enjoyable
the
taste
is
somewhat
spicy
being
overwhelmed
by
allspice
nutmeg
and
cinnamom
there
is
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
given
the
spices
this
is
not
a
highly
drinkable
beer
but
it
it
certainly
worth
giving
a
try
enjoy
due
to
the
spices
though
i
couldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
id
get
sick
of
it
after
about
partway
through
the
second
recommended
oelergud
all
the
flavors
that
should
be
there
are
there
the
malt
and
pumpkin
combine
to
give
a
warm
toasty
and
slightly
sweet
fruity
flavor
while
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
compliment
rather
than
overwhelm
the
very
present
hops
definitely
not
a
novelty
creation
but
a
beer
that
celebrates
the
season
ive
come
to
really
appreciate
and
anticipate
the
annual
apperance
of
pumpkin
beers
this
ones
an
outstanding
example
of
the
class
pours
a
clear
darkcopper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
brownsugar
pumpkin
and
pie
spices
compose
the
aroma
the
spiciness
is
folded
nicely
into
a
faint
alcohol
smell
as
you
work
through
the
glass
nutmeg
seems
to
stand
out
as
the
dominant
spice
pleasing
alcohol
warming
nice
in
the
autumn
outdoors
the
pumpkin
taste
is
present
all
the
way
through
the
taste
finish
is
rather
hoppy
for
a
pumpkin
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
beer
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
pours
a
twofingered
white
head
leaving
a
good
lace
pale
amber
color
light
carbonation
sweet
spicy
nose
starts
sweet
the
brown
sugar
comes
through
that
hints
of
pumpkin
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
this
could
be
a
session
beer
except
at
7
abv
one
must
be
wary
2
30
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
beer
is
good
happy
beering
this
is
coming
out
more
negative
than
id
like
this
is
a
good
beer
maybe
too
strong
for
the
style
though
although
the
pumpkin
ales
are
not
typically
my
favorite
i
have
to
admit
that
this
took
me
by
surprise
i
picked
this
one
up
because
i
fell
in
love
with
the
aprihop
that
i
had
at
the
boston
beer
summit
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
me
either
the
nose
of
the
beer
is
strong
but
not
overwhelming
and
leaves
enough
room
for
you
mouth
to
make
up
its
own
conclusion
the
finish
was
very
nice
and
not
too
long
overall
i
would
consider
this
ale
highly
in
this
category
and
would
be
something
i
look
forward
to
having
every
fall
the
funny
thing
is
that
it
is
very
drinkable
actually
superb
but
the
pumpkin
thing
just
brings
you
back
to
that
one
time
of
year
perhaps
if
it
were
different
then
it
would
be
different
but
alas
and
alack
mouthfeel
is
nice
the
aftertaste
leaves
that
umami
sensation
in
your
mouth
o
you
really
cant
complain
though
some
may
call
this
a
novelty
beer
it
could
gain
acceptance
if
people
would
shake
their
associations
with
thanksgiving
all
in
all
another
superb
offering
from
dfh
pours
a
very
clear
orange
color
almost
irredescent
small
head
disappears
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
is
all
pumpkin
pie
spices
nutmeg
bigtime
cinnamon
and
a
big
waft
of
allspice
maybe
even
some
spicy
hoppiness
in
there
as
well
taste
is
really
great
for
a
pumpkin
ale
its
mainly
a
very
spicy
tasting
brew
up
front
then
some
sweet
candied
pumpkin
and
then
a
nice
bitter
finish
that
lingers
for
a
while
like
one
forum
poster
said
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
no
doubt
about
it
this
would
sit
perfectly
against
a
plate
of
turkey
on
thanksgiving
day
mouth
is
medium
to
full
slightly
oily
and
smooth
its
very
drinkable
youre
definitely
thinking
about
glass
number
two
right
away
a
good
treat
for
the
upcoming
days
of
fall
doesnt
make
you
feel
sick
from
the
pumking
flavors
and
is
well
controlled
at
that
12
ounce
bottle
with
freshness
info
notched
onto
the
label
2004
batch
pours
medium
golden
almond
in
color
clear
with
a
white
head
and
leaves
a
decent
amout
on
lacing
bready
malty
nose
full
bodied
and
rich
mouthfeel
nice
depth
of
malty
body
and
flavor
pumkiny
undertones
and
spices
evident
but
in
background
adding
to
complexity
and
intrigue
usually
this
is
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
but
this
creation
is
a
winner
tasty
brew
an
obvious
choice
to
go
with
hearty
fall
dishes
can
you
say
thanksgiving
dinner
just
tried
the
2004
version
looks
like
another
interesting
beer
from
dfh
what
surprised
me
most
about
this
beer
is
that
for
a
spiced
beer
it
is
remarkably
balanced
it
is
true
that
it
exudes
pumpkin
pie
smell
and
taste
and
you
can
pick
out
lots
of
spicy
notes
but
you
can
also
taste
the
malt
and
the
hops
wow
as
for
drinkability
i
tried
to
have
two
in
a
row
and
there
is
no
doubt
this
one
is
at
7
abv
if
i
dont
need
to
do
anything
after
drinking
the
drinkability
index
improves
but
otherwise
one
in
a
session
is
probably
enough
ill
need
to
pick
up
a
few
more
4
packs
good
job
dfh
buy
this
shit
for
haloween
parties
i
know
i
will
the
funny
thing
is
that
it
is
very
drinkable
actually
superb
but
the
pumpkin
thing
just
brings
you
back
to
that
one
time
of
year
perhaps
if
it
were
different
then
it
would
be
different
but
alas
and
alack
mouthfeel
is

the

leaves
that
umami
sensation
in

o
you
really

a

beer
it
could
gain
acceptance
if
people
would
shake
their
associations
with
thanksgiving
all
in
all
another
superb
offering
from
dfh
very
excited
to
try
this
one
poured
out
a
copper
rubylike
color
but
didnt
have
anything
special
for
a
head
on
it
i
must
say
that
the
color
is
quite
impressive
aroma
is
pretty
much
assumed
in
this
style
of
beer
i
thought
it
was
nice
and
balanced
but
not
a
lot
of
depth
to
it
the
thing
i
liked
about
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
that
it
actually
had
a
pumpkin
taste
to
it
and
not
overloaded
with
spice
granted
i
love
spiced
beer
but
it
was
nice
to
have
a
pumpkin
ale
and
not
have
it
focused
on
the
spices
very
enjoyable
beer
and
smooth
for
7
abv
glad
i
bought
a
4
pack
but
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
deep
orangebrownish
pour
with
a
little
bit
of
head
very
balanced
aroma
consisting
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
bread
malts
the
taste
was
outstanding
same
as
the
aroma
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
but
this
is
where
the
pumpkin
really
shines
through
perfect
for
those
cool
fall
evenings
this
is
a
beer
that
i
hope
will
still
be
available
to
me
when
november
and
december
come
rolling
around
a
must
try
draught
ctriver
brewers
festival
this
may
be
the
best
pumpkin
beer
that
i
have
had
yet
this
one
pours
an
orangishamber
color
with
almost
no
head
there
is
a
wonderful
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
also
some
maltiness
in
there
too
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
the
pumpkin
spices
with
a
good
malty
beer
some
hops
also
this
was
really
excellent
im
having
this
beer
in
a
flight
of
pumpkin
ales
a
new
england
specialty
it
appears
im
not
a
big
fan
of
sugary
beers
like
scotch
ale
that
said
this
might
be
an
excellent
dessert
beer
after
a
hearty
meal
because
it
is
not
sickly
sweet
perhaps
a
true
specialty
beer
just
a
good
pumpkin
ale
right
here
got
a
pint
from
supposedly
the
first
tapped
keg
of
this
years
batch
at
blind
tiger
in
manhattan
this
pumpkin
ale
is
sweeter
and
maltier
than
the
only
other
i
have
for
recent
comparison
which
is
the
smuttynose
pumpkin
there
are
nice
hints
of
allspice
clove
and
maybe
cinnamon
the
beer
also
finishes
quite
dry
with
a
very
earthy
pumpkin
flavor
a
dogfish
head
guy
owner
i
think
was
at
the
bar
and
gave
a
little
summary
of
the
beer
saying
something
about
fermenting
the
natural
sugars
in
the
pumpkin
flesh
which
i
would
imagine
contributes
to
this
quality
anyway
i
thought
this
beer
was
highly
drinkable
for
a
pumpkin
ale
and
if
i
wasnt
at
the
blind
tiger
with
so
many
other
brews
to
choose
from
i
could
have
knocked
back
a
few
more
ill
certainly
be
aiming
to
do
just
that
again
sometime
this
fall
light
brown
color
with
a
hint
of
red
odors
of
light
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
maybe
a
little
brown
sugar
malty
sweet
flavor
at
first
light
pumpkin
pie
flavor
in
the
middle
and
light
alcohol
and
hop
finish
overall
a
balanced
approach
nothing
too
hardcore
drinkability
and
overall
finely
crafted
and
nicely
balanced
hops
spices
and
some
sweetness
from
the
pumpkin
or
malt
not
sure
all
manage
to
coexist
in
perfect
harmony
this
is
definitely
a
unique
brew
and
a
good
way
to
get
ready
for
fall
poured
a
very
nice
deep
orange
color
with
a
good
head
that
seemed
to
linger
good
aromaa
really
nice
mix
of
spicemalt
and
pumpkin
very
good
malt
flavor
upfront
the
pumpkin
actually
comes
thru
in
this
onethe
spices
are
subtle
though
definately
presentespecially
compared
to
some
of
the
other
pumpkin
brews
full
bodied
as
is
found
with
most
of
the
dogfish
brews
a
very
drinkable
beer
so
far
id
have
to
say
if
youre
looking
for
a
pumpkin
brewtry
this
one
this
poured
out
a
slightly
hazy
amber
hue
with
a
light
tan
head
of
decent
size
the
head
drops
to
a
cap
of
bubbles
leaving
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
smells
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
spice
almost
exactly
like
pumpkin
pie
the
taste
had
a
lot
of
the
same
spice
elements
in
it
with
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
like
brown
sugar
the
aftertaste
had
a
nice
spice
lingering
about
i
will
have
to
try
this
with
some
pumpkin
pie
because
it
tastes
great
and
would
go
perfect
of
course
the
mouthfeel
was
about
average
with
a
light
to
medium
body
drinkability
basically
depends
on
how
much
you
like
pumpkin
pie
type
dishes
in
my
case
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
each
year
definitely
give
this
one
a
shot
especially
if
you
are
looking
for
a
pumpkin
ale
ahh
autumn
i
love
this
time
of
year
the
cool
crisp
nights
its
actually
90
degrees
in
boston
today
the
colorful
leaves
most
importantly
fall
beer
octoberfests
and
pumpkin
ales
i
started
out
with
dogfish
head
punkin
ale
this
year
it
poured
a
medium
brown
with
just
a
slight
head
and
a
mild
lace
you
can
catch
a
hint
of
the
cinnamon
the
nose
before
the
nutmeg
hits
you
its
the
spice
that
dominates
this
carries
over
into
the
taste
nutmeg
up
front
and
pumpkin
in
the
middle
just
a
touch
of
the
malt
on
the
back
end
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
the
spice
flavors
this
would
seem
to
be
a
great
warmer
im
not
sure
i
could
drink
to
many
of
these
though
do
to
the
heavy
spice
influence
pours
a
what
else
pumpkinorange
color
with
light
and
lacy
cream
colored
head
smell
is
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
bottle
claims
that
the
beer
is
brewed
with
real
pumpkin
brown
sugar
allspice
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
and
they
are
right
i
can
identify
each
flavor
in
the
brew
not
much
hops
to
note
this
is
a
fun
brew
to
find
especially
if
you
find
a
four
pack
on
sale
for
four
bucks
like
i
did
however
i
wont
be
making
this
a
regular
brew
as
i
cant
drink
many
of
these
before
longing
for
more
traditional
beer
a
good
idea
for
thanksgiving
dinner
perhaps
clear
copper
body
with
a
medium
creamcolored
head
that
fades
into
a
creamy
ring
around
a
stormy
weather
pattern
the
aroma
is
really
more
spice
than
pumpkin
but
the
spice
isnt
overwhelming
theres
a
slightly
cakelike
and
caramel
malt
underneath
the
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
and
mostly
balanced
except
for
a
bitterness
that
doesnt
seem
to
quite
fit
in
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
ive
had
better
pumpkin
ales
scores
are
per
style
based
on
the
fact
noone
has
been
close
to
them
on
this
style
malty
and
sweet
with
clove
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
bursting
forth
on
the
palate
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
around
during
the
fall
i
know
its
not
really
the
season
for
this
beer
but
what
the
heck
i
might
have
been
even
more
let
down
if
i
tried
it
around
halloween
pours
a
luminescent
orangecopper
color
with
a
medium
thin
beige
head
head
retention
is
pretty
weak
and
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
spiced
with
cinnamon
and
ginger
as
well
as
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
syrupy
and
sweet
with
malt
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
flavors
it
becomes
overbearing
at
times
the
finish
retains
the
sweet
character
and
is
pumpkiny
and
malty
this
is
a
decent
seasonal
it
is
just
a
little
too
much
in
the
sweet
department
at
times
quite
a
tasty
spiced
beer
i
can
really
taste
the
allspice
and
cinnamon
flavors
the
whole
time
the
beer
is
in
my
mouth
i
like
the
creaminess
and
the
carbonation
as
i
think
they
add
to
the
experience
smells
ok
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
certainly
tasty
this
beer
reminds
me
of
harpoons
winter
warmer
one
of
my
favorite
holiday
brews
pours
goldenorange
with
a
transient
head
smells
like
butter
squash
and
ginger
very
sweet
and
sugary
taste
of
ginger
allspice
and
pumpkin
seeds
with
a
great
mild
hoppiness
and
cinnamon
flavor
that
makes
it
splicy
in
the
mouth
but
leaves
a
clean
finish
a
bit
too
sweet
to
be
especially
drinkable
but
i
cant
think
of
any
pumpkin
brew
except
maybe
southampton
that
i
could
drink
more
than
2
of
anyway
worth
dragging
all
the
way
home
though
pours
out
a
brown
amber
with
a
big
offwhite
head
i
do
taste
the
pumpkin
buti
wish
i
tasted
it
more
balance
is
solid
and
flavor
is
tastygood
certainly
a
beer
whichh
i
enjoy
drinking
but
not
up
there
with
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
try
it
itisquite
easyto
driinkkk
i
thank
mr
cokes
for
the
sample
a
nice
beer
for
something
different
as
with
many
other
flavored
beers
i
wouldnt
recommend
consuming
more
than
one
or
two
the
flavors
arent
good
in
large
amounts
the
color
is
a
cloudy
orange
it
is
warming
for
those
cool
fall
nights
and
has
a
pumpkin
spice
aroma
the
taste
was
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
finishing
off
with
brown
sugar
the
alcohol
content
was
too
overwhelming
the
spices
were
not
well
balanced
with
the
maltiness
the
aftertaste
was
great
but
the
beer
itself
was
just
okay
one
of
if
not
the
biggest
seasonal
pumpkin
ales
out
there
perhaps
a
bit
overwrought
with
too
much
spiced
sweetness
i
feel
like
im
drinking
a
candy
store
especially
when
it
warms
up
perhaps
a
bit
more
punkin
and
grainy
malt
and
less
allspice
and
brown
sugar
i
can
appreciate
the
effort
and
laud
the
inventiveness
but
its
not
for
me
well
worth
the
money
for
the
pack
for
the
experience
alone
but
ill
stick
with
marzens
come
september
second
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
the
first
being
kuhnhenns
bottled
take
on
the
style
ive
had
this
beer
in
my
fridge
for
about
4
months
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
maybe
even
some
clove
offwhite
head
leaves
a
little
lace
as
it
fades
to
a
film
transparent
amber
colored
beer
with
an
orange
hue
the
pumpkin
pie
aroma
carries
over
into
the
flavor
but
isnt
as
strong
theres
some
hops
down
there
that
cant
quite
make
it
to
the
surface
its
not
as
thick
as
the
aroma
suggests
the
flavor
is
pretty
strong
but
doesnt
stick
to
your
tongue
i
wouldnt
call
the
finish
clean
but
it
doesnt
hang
around
long
either
it
definitely
leans
more
towards
the
pumpkin
pie
end
with
spices
present
loads
of
flavor
and
aroma
are
probably
too
much
for
half
the
beer
drinkers
out
there
if
you
don
t
like
pumpkin
pie
stay
away
otherwise
id
say
drink
it
closer
the
bottling
date
so
the
hops
have
a
fighting
chance
quite
alcoholic
in
its
linger
dogfish
did
a
great
job
with
this
brew
the
pumpkin
is
well
balanced
with
a
strong
sweet
backing
brown
sugar
the
combination
works
well
very
easy
beer
to
drink
though
even
at
a
holloween
event
it
was
hard
to
drink
more
than
two
this
is
far
more
than
a
simple
me
too
beer
brewed
with
pumpkin
its
a
beer
that
very
well
might
define
this
niche
style
though
not
really
something
id
normally
do
with
a
brew
i
have
discovered
that
this
a
great
beer
to
cook
with
good
looking
burnt
orange
brew
with
white
head
that
falls
to
ring
of
ever
rising
bubbles
smells
wonderful
pumpkin
nutmeg
allpice
and
touch
of
cinnamon
thanksgiving
in
a
bottle
had
a
couple
of
bottles
with
thanksgiving
dinner
went
well
saved
a
couple
for
review
as
you
can
see
i
tend
to
procrastinate
only
got
to
try
three
pumpkin
brews
this
year
due
to
my
location
in
budwiser
is
king
land
this
one
tasted
the
most
spicey
of
the
three
great
fall
brew
but
wouldnt
drink
on
regular
basis
as
i
would
the
other
pumpkin
ale
i
reviewed
tastes
like
it
smells
mouthfeel
is
on
light
side
of
medium
good
spice
beer
for
the
occasion
this
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
smells
fantastic
spicy
like
pumpkin
pie
theres
allspice
and
cinnamon
and
even
some
clove
i
think
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
there
is
a
definite
spice
taste
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
bubbly
this
is
a
good
spiced
drinking
beer
in
my
opinion
there
is
a
good
spiced
drinking
beer
thanks
to
twelvevoltman
for
securing
a
4
pack
for
me
pours
a
medium
brownish
with
some
golden
ruby
highlights
and
a
sort
of
khaki
head
smell
is
of
spice
and
a
bit
of
vegetable
and
pumpkin
the
taste
is
pumpkiny
up
front
and
then
just
melds
into
a
spicy
malty
mess
followed
by
a
drying
hop
finish
that
just
jumps
the
train
off
the
track
drinkabilty
was
low
as
i
was
able
to
finish
the
beer
but
wasnt
going
begging
for
another
not
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
i
had
last
year
cottonwood
was
by
far
a
more
well
rounded
beer
imo
definitely
the
best
pumpkin
ale
out
there
leave
it
to
the
mad
geniuses
at
dfh
to
make
a
pumpkin
ale
that
is
only
not
a
novelty
but
is
a
damn
good
beer
delicious
and
absolutely
one
ill
have
next
year
as
far
as
pumpkin
ales
go
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
i
had
good
cinnamonnutmeg
scent
to
it
looked
beautiful
in
the
glass
orangeamber
color
taste
was
pumpkiney
but
a
good
dose
of
hearty
malt
along
with
it
due
to
the
taste
i
doubt
anyone
is
downing
a
bunch
of
this
all
night
hazy
tawny
bronze
thin
but
stiff
and
dogged
head
leaves
sparse
lace
aroma
comprised
of
buttery
caramel
and
nutmeg
with
medium
toffee
and
nutty
brittle
tones
understated
cinnamon
and
ripe
fig
esters
as
well
very
well
rounded
and
appetizing
aromawise
in
flavor
a
browned
butter
drizzled
toasted
biscuit
impression
is
the
dominant
malt
presence
stately
slightly
herbaceous
allcpice
and
citric
hop
combination
is
an
undertone
lightly
bittered
with
balance
skewed
towards
caramel
but
sweetness
never
becomes
cloying
subtle
bubblegum
esters
emerge
as
it
breathes
helping
facilitate
a
candyish
overall
suggestion
well
calculated
and
integrated
pumpkin
spice
presence
full
dextrinous
body
and
viscous
but
not
syrupy
in
mouthfeel
finishes
with
soft
alcohol
warmth
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
lending
a
lingering
spiced
hot
toddy
impression
an
excellent
pumpkin
ale
with
judicious
spicing
and
a
simple
malt
backbone
with
girth
very
tasty
and
well
crafted
id
like
to
give
big
props
to
my
bro
mikey
up
in
ct
thanks
for
the
eye
opener
man
im
a
huge
fan
of
dogfish
head
but
i
cant
say
i
care
for
this
beer
it
needs
more
malt
or
hops
to
balance
the
spices
which
overpower
the
brews
taste
if
youre
interested
in
this
style
id
suggest
trying
post
road
pumpkin
ale
instead
dark
brown
with
orange
hues
and
an
impressive
white
head
the
aroma
is
cinnimon
with
nutmeg
a
lot
of
brown
sugar
comes
through
in
the
taste
along
with
the
spices
at
7
alcohol
its
pretty
strong
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
it
is
one
of
the
best
on
the
market
right
now
i
expected
more
dogfish
is
generally
about
more
of
everything
i
would
have
expected
more
pumpkin
more
spice
more
everything
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
give
this
one
a
shot
generally
i
am
not
a
great
fan
of
the
pumpkin
spiced
brews
but
this
one
was
really
good
the
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
a
thick
creamy
head
the
beer
had
little
cloudiness
the
smell
was
clearly
spicy
with
the
pumpkin
pie
smell
the
taste
again
spicy
and
hoppy
i
think
nutmeg
was
the
leading
flavor
driver
for
this
beer
it
almost
tasted
rumlike
at
the
hoppy
finish
drinkable
as
far
as
bold
spice
beers
go
not
quite
clear
amber
orange
ale
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
of
pumpkin
pie
with
the
spices
and
nutmeg
especially
being
most
evident
not
very
strong
smelling
but
whats
there
is
really
good
big
malty
taste
the
nutmeg
and
brown
sugar
are
very
apparrent
nice
pumpkin
flavor
underneath
it
all
some
hops
balance
the
taste
out
rather
well
at
the
end
good
reasonably
full
mouthfeel
my
first
pumpkin
ale
and
im
really
impressed
hope
there
are
others
equally
as
good
for
anyone
who
hasnt
had
one
before
start
here
an
enjoyable
libation
for
the
halloween
time
of
year
maybe
best
of
the
pumpkin
ales
even
more
enjoyable
from
draught
even
though
i
havent
had
many
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
tried
the
color
is
a
nice
dark
orangeamber
fall
color
which
puts
me
in
a
pumpkinautumn
mood
it
smells
and
tastes
like
spicy
pumpkin
almost
like
a
pumpkin
pie
but
not
as
sweet
its
got
a
good
balance
i
love
pumpkin
flavor
and
the
spices
that
go
with
it
and
this
beer
met
my
expectations
clear
autumnal
reddish
brown
small
white
frothy
head
sweet
baking
spices
on
the
nose
full
textured
body
smooth
and
creamy
huge
spicey
sugary
flavor
finishes
dry
from
a
gentle
hop
bite
quite
different
than
most
pumpkin
ales
and
is
better
for
it
spice
profile
is
interesting
without
being
overwhelming
a
great
fall
treat
as
a
general
foe
of
pumpkin
beers
i
must
admit
that
this
has
impressed
me
still
not
something
id
run
out
to
try
again
but
this
is
the
best
of
the
lot
ive
tried
and
ive
given
the
ratings
accordingly
and
cheers
to
36poundlovechild
for
providing
ive
never
really
been
a
fan
of
flavoredspiced
beers
but
this
one
breaks
those
rules
pours
a
deep
brown
liquid
the
aromas
of
cinnamon
allspice
and
brown
sugar
come
through
a
hint
of
malt
the
flavors
of
the
malt
spices
and
a
bit
of
pumpkin
flow
through
out
the
brew
evenly
with
an
ebbing
and
flowing
bitterness
level
the
body
is
smooth
supporting
a
deep
alcoholic
warmth
that
is
very
nice
in
the
recent
dropped
temperatures
f
dogfish
did
not
overdo
it
on
the
spices
which
was
nice
it
looked
very
good
but
to
be
honest
the
bar
was
dark
not
an
overwhelming
pumpkin
taste
but
it
was
definitely
noticeable
very
very
smooth
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
fall
not
a
complex
beer
but
great
to
have
this
beer
poured
a
medium
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
off
white
head
that
left
laticed
lace
as
it
subsided
some
carbonation
was
present
an
aroma
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
other
spices
the
flavor
was
of
malt
nutmeg
cinnamon
with
a
slightly
astrigent
finish
with
a
warming
feeling
of
the
alcohol
present
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
dogfish
seems
to
pull
if
off
better
than
most
others
this
beer
poured
out
a
very
clear
light
amber
brown
color
and
had
a
thinning
white
head
of
foam
the
aroma
is
special
to
this
beer

heavy
with
spices
including
pumpkin
pie
spices
cinnamon
cardamom
clove
and
nutmeg
its
an
earthy
and
festive
aroma
perfect
for
autumn
the
same
things
that
come
out
in
the
aroma
transfer
directly
to
the
flavor
during
the
first
sip
the
spices
are
definitely
in
the
forefront
here
theres
some
hop
bitterness
and
some
malt
body
it
reminded
me
of
a
spicy
and
light
nut
brown
ale
an
excellent
seasonal
and
a
beer
that
doesnt
hide
what
it
truly
is
i
was
quite
wary
of
this
one
as
i
had
only
had
one
pumpkin
ale
in
the
past
forget
which
one
but
it
was
a
while
ago
and
it
was
simply
awful
the
dfh
punkin
ale
is
quite
the
opposite
of
that
this
could
surprisingly
be
a
fun
session
ale
it
pours
a
nice
amber
colour
with
a
minimal
head
that
does
not
hang
around
for
very
long
but
leaves
a
solid
lacing
the
smell
scared
me
at
first
ginger
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
of
course
pumpkin
it
reminded
me
quite
a
bit
of
harpoons
winter
warmer
a
beer
that
i
loathe
thankfully
the
taste
of
this
one
made
me
forget
the
similarities
to
the
winter
warmer
it
echoes
the
smell
relying
a
bit
moreso
on
the
pumpkin
flavour
upfront
with
a
spicy
finish
but
everything
is
quite
subtle
and
subdued
flavour
is
not
shoved
down
your
throat
but
hinted
at
throughout
which
made
this
brew
that
much
more
enjoyable
ill
definitely
be
looking
to
sample
this
every
fall
from
now
on
12
oz
bottle
part
of
my
recent
bif
3
0
package
poured
a
deep
amber
with
a
fairly
good
head
that
didnt
stick
around
long
and
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
allspice
and
maybe
a
hint
of
cinnamon
but
weak
and
even
lacking
in
pumpkin
it
smells
more
like
a
spiced
ginger
ale
taste
is
more
of
the
spicyness
with
some
hops
thrown
in
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
for
my
first
punkin
beer
but
i
find
it
a
little
lacking
in
the
body
it
has
a
good
start
and
a
decent
finish
but
it
needs
a
kick
in
the
middle
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
one
finger
of
head
there
is
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aromas
of
pumpkin
ginger
and
nutmeg
fill
the
top
of
the
glass
very
spicy
the
taste
is
very
subtle
at
first
just
a
little
sweet
the
finish
has
all
the
spice
and
lots
of
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
coming
through
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
strong
the
drinkability
is
fairly
nice
for
a
7
brew
a
great
seasonal
treat
this
really
strikes
me
as
a
pumpkin
beer
as
opposed
to
many
beers
that
strike
me
as
beer
with
pumpkin
added
simultaneously
tart
and
spicy
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
really
works
together
with
the
solid
body
to
make
a
great
drink
the
feel
is
first
rate
being
medium
and
smooth
with
a
clean
and
crisp
finish
my
drinkability
rating
fairly
high
for
the
abv
as
this
dimension
simply
didnt
come
through
in
the
taste
as
others
may
have
observed
this
is
more
like
pumpkin
pie
ale
than
pumpkin
ale
the
pumkin
spices
really
stand
out
i
like
that
im
just
trying
to
figure
out
what
food
to
have
w
this
beer
this
is
not
a
session
beer
because
the
flavor
is
too
unique
you
need
to
have
this
one
with
a
meal
picture
a
nut
brown
ale
with
a
pumpkin
flavor
and
the
nose
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
you
have
this
one
poured
a
small
head
that
disappeared
quickly
left
a
watery
looking
lace
that
wasnt
too
appealing
clear
amber
in
color
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
very
spicy
taste
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
its
hard
to
make
out
the
individual
tastes
of
each
spice
comes
across
more
of
a
ginger
taste
more
bodycarbonationand
less
spices
leaves
a
wheaty
and
dry
after
taste
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
definite
smell
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
allspice
but
the
brown
ale
is
behind
it
all
too
tastes
of
pumpkin
pie
not
sure
what
constitutes
pumpkin
pie
crust
after
sharing
some
with
my
friend
he
came
up
with
a
very
good
point
the
beer
tastes
not
like
pumpkin
pie
as
so
much
as
it
actually
tastes
like
gingersnap
beer
taste
for
yourself
s
d
prost
amber
color
with
a
quickly
dissapating
head
the
smell
is
pleasant
like
walking
into
a
bakery
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
all
apparent
in
the
nose
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
is
very
good
the
taste
of
the
fruit
does
not
overpower
the
fact
that
this
is
a
beer
finishes
with
a
nice
flavor
on
the
tongue
of
cinnamon
overall
a
good
beer
from
this
excellent
brewery
glowing
amber
with
a
fizzy
shortlasting
head
nose
is
an
impressive
blend
of
cinnamon
allspice
nutmeg
and
a
pumpkin
carving
contest
all
of
these
flavors
come
through
on
palate
with
an
emphasis
on
the
zesty
spicy
characteristics
of
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
spritzy
carbonation
entices
the
tongue
perhaps
the
most
viscous
fullbodied
mouthfeel
ive
noticed
in
a
pumpkin
beer
warming
alcohol
is
noticeable
on
the
prolonged
finish
this
is
a
welldone
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
that
sets
itself
apart
from
others
the
spices
and
alcohol
content
keep
this
beer
from
becoming
overly
drinkable
and
refreshing
however
clear
brownish
orange
color
small
head
that
disappeared
quickly
nice
smell
spice
dominates
allspice
nutmeg
cinnamon
really
come
thru
the
pumpkin
nutmeg
step
up
in
the
taste
with
the
brown
ale
making
a
nice
backbone
crisp
tangy
spicy
on
the
toungue
very
drinkable
a
nice
brew
backwash
this
is
probably
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
closely
approximating
what
i
remember
of
the
one
i
had
at
rodneys
years
ago
as
i
mentioned
in
my
post
road
reviewbefore
knowing
about
this
the
rodneys
version
was
also
based
on
a
brown
ale
which
made
for
a
more
successful
result
this
beer
really
transcends
its
status
as
a
seasonal
novelty
beer
and
becomes
something
id
be
happy
to
have
almost
anytime
my
one
cavil
is
that
it
is
too
hoppy
which
competes
with
the
other
flavors
id
prefer
a
slightly
gentler
britishstyle
brown
ale
feel
to
see
if
the
hops
mellow
i
plan
to
put
one
away
to
age
pricey
poured
a
clear
amber
orange
color
with
a
thin
head
a
definite
spicy
aroma
is
quickly
noticed
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
spice
as
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
are
clearly
evident
the
body
was
slightly
thin
and
the
spiciness
lasts
a
bit
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
the
higher
alocohol
content
is
barely
noticeable
nice
beer
to
sip
on
a
chilly
october
evening
while
sitting
looking
at
your
carved
pumpkins
though
it
is
not
a
beer
to
drink
several
of
appearance
copper
amber
orang
when
held
to
the
light
forms
with
a
cream
colored
relatively
thin
head
that
leaves
behind
speckled
lacing
aroma
first
thing
evident
is
the
spices
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
some
mild
pumpkin
tones
taste
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
this
fall
not
as
resdiually
sweet
or
cloyingly
syrupy
lacking
some
of
the
pumpkin
flavor
that
others
have
more
of
but
the
spices
are
dead
on
here
along
with
a
decent
kick
in
the
acohol
department
at
7abv
thats
not
too
shabby
mouthfeel
some
residual
stickiness
still
has
the
syrupy
extract
like
feel
but
this
ones
not
nearly
as
bad
as
some
of
the
other
pumpkin
ales
out
there
good
carbonation
enjoyable
drinkability
a
definite
one
at
a
time
beer
but
to
be
enjoyed
surely
every
fall
this
made
for
an
excellent
snakebite
notes
soft
warming
and
spicy
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
im
not
as
excited
with
it
as
i
thought
i
would
be
but
its
a
musttry
for
the
fall
season
hazy
orange
color
with
an
offwhite
bubbly
head
that
settles
quickly
nose
is
equal
parts
punkin
and
spice
and
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
plus
some
sweet
honey
and
toffee
flavor
is
very
balanced
between
punkin
malts
and
spices
would
have
liked
more
pumpkin
to
come
through
though
finishes
a
bit
sweet
with
sweet
pear
and
alcohol
tingling
the
mouth
in
the
finish
pretty
good
but
not
as
good
as
i
expected
pretty
good
for
a
fruitvegetable
beer
spiked
with
spices
drinkability
this
is
kind
of
a
weird
beer
as
are
most
pumpkin
ales
worth
a
try
if
you
consider
yourself
a
beer
geek
i
picked
this
up
for
an
impromptu
beer
tasting
for
a
group
of
friends
we
all
found
it
interesting
but
i
dont
think
anyone
was
overly
impressed
im
finding
it
hard
to
finish
the
bottle
this
is
definitely
one
to
share

in

upfront
a
smooth

nutmeg
and

dominates
but
then
the

flavor
is
crisp
and
has
a

not

or

clean

of

after
you

and

stays
on

the
more
you
sip
the
beer
the
more
prominent
the
pumpkin
stands
out
lively
coating
mouth
slightly
viscous
to
the
tongue
a
nice
treat
for
an
october
night
this
would
be
something
you
either
like
or
hate
and
well
i
like
it
i
have
to
say
this
one
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
a
real
nice
brew
pours
a
burnt
orange
color
with
a
real
nice
creamy
12
inch
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacingaroma
is
of
some
serious
nutmeg
and
cardimum
with
light
cinnamon
notes
taste
hits
with
a
real
pumpkin
flavor
with
the
sices
hitting
after
the
initial
pumpkin
flavor
so
you
get
the
whole
spectrum
of
flavors
a
great
all
around
beer
definently
with
the
weather
changing
right
now
very
nicehad
at
tavern
616
in
north
walespa
pours
with
a
beige
colred
head
sporting
short
head
retention
that
settles
quickly
onto
clear
amberlight
red
liquid
the
label
says
this
is
a
brown
ale
but
i
dont
see
anything
brown
about
it
nose
is
spicy
with
nutmeg
and
allspice
malt
and
hop
with
slight
punkin
aromas
lastly
the
taste
is
a
sharp
blast
of
goodly
hop
bitters
followed
by
some
ale
yeastbased
fruitiness
sweet
malts
spiciness
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
which
leads
into
the
finish
which
is
lipsmackingly
bitter
and
long
the
most
bitter
example
of
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
a
hopheads
pumpkin
ale
if
you
will
someone
should
send
a
bottle
of
this
to
shipyard
so
they
understand
what
a
punkin
ale
is
supposed
to
taste
like
it
pours
an
orange
tinted
amber
with
a
fading
white
head
pumpkin
nutmeg
allspice
malt
and
alcohol
fumes
in
that
order
make
up
the
aroma
the
malt
body
could
use
a
bit
more
oomph
but
its
far
more
substantial
than
that
weakass
shipyard
flavors
of
pumpkin
pie
come
to
mind
as
it
should
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
dominate
as
allspice
sugar
and
nutmeg
offer
a
nice
supporting
touch
a
mild
limelike
bitterness
seems
almost
out
of
place
but
after
a
few
gulps
seems
to
fit
in
with
the
punkin
gang
warming
alcohol
provides
the
expected
punch
when
you
smell
and
taste
it
crisp
carbonation
starts
you
into
what
becomes
a
very
smooth
bodied
beer
it
is
pretty
full
in
that
category
and
it
is
loaded
with
complex
flavors
pumpkins
do
not
dominate
but
you
can
get
a
good
taste
of
them
the
spices
are
the
real
story
here
and
the
perfect
balance
of
the
flavors
creates
a
really
great
brew
i
had
a
small
sample
of
this
at
sippin
by
the
river
and
everyone
was
shocked
when
i
said
this
is
pretty
good
i
was
a
full
out
pumpkin
hater
before
this
beer
after
a
pint
on
draught
i
may
never
look
upon
a
pumpkin
ale
negatively
again
a
very
nice
brew
indeed
my
first
pumpkin
ale
quite
good
spicy
aroma
very
little
head
but
color
was
like
a
light
pumpkin
pie
taste
was
interesting
a
malty
flavor
but
with
alcohol
kick
aftertaste
was
good
for
such
a
high
abv
the
taste
lingered
just
a
bit
in
the
back
of
the
palate
just
enough
to
invite
you
to
sip
more
mouthfeel
was
chewy
in
a
nice
way
similar
to
a
desert
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
such
a
full
flavored
beer
at
7
abv
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
drinkable
i
just
wish
it
came
in
6
packs
for
the
same
price
note
this
beer
gets
better
as
it
warms
the
distinctions
of
the
aromas
and
tastes
become
more
prominent
with
each
degree
increase
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
would
get
again
and
again
great
representative
of
its
style
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
smallish
white
head
that
mostly
lasts
leaves
decent
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
spicy
cinnamon
clove
some
nutmeg
maybe
a
hint
of
alcohol
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
quite
spicy
slight
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
end
medium
body
minimal
carbonation
lasting
spice
flavors
nice
orange
pumpkin
color
not
much
head
smells
of
allspice
cinnamon
a
bit
of
nutmeg
and
bitter
pumpkin
hmmm
just
like
the
bottle
says
faint
aromas
but
nice
and
intriguing
taste
is
dominated
by
the
dogfish
head
brown
sugar
only
subtle
hints
of
the
spices
and
pumpkin
nice
that
its
not
artificial
tasting
but
i
would
have
liked
the
spices
to
shine
through
more
id
like
to
try
this
again
if
i
were
to
choose
between
bottle
and
tap
i
have
had
both
i
would
go
with
tap
overall
i
was
a
little
disapointed
by
this
beer
it
had
a
very
interesting
nose
but
the
flavor
itself
was
more
along
the
lines
of
a
middle
of
the
road
american
pale
ale
with
some
pumpkin
spice
in
the
background
not
bad
by
any
means
i
was
just
expecting
a
bit
more
from
such
a
great
brewery
comments
i
was
a
bit
hesitant
to
try
this
because
i
dont
like
pumpkin
very
much
but
it
was
suggested
that
there
are
enough
other
flavors
present
that
i
might
like
it
anyway
i
did
very
much
you
just
never
know
the
brown
sugar
was
fantastic
yum
a
golden
copper
colour
with
little
head
or
lacing
nose
is
a
little
spicy
and
sweet
the
taste
is
quite
something
though
ive
never
had
a
pumpkin
ale
before
this
id
call
the
flavour
as
something
of
a
cross
between
pumpkin
pie
filling
mulled
cider
and
an
amber
ale
quite
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
slight
hoppy
finish
that
being
said
this
is
also
like
pumpkin
pie
and
mulled
cider
in
the
fact
that
its
really
not
for
imbibing
in
quantity
as
the
flavour
can
overcome
you
the
flavor
is
very
reminiscent
of
pumpkin
pie
but
make
no
mistake
it
still
tastes
like
beer
the
amount
of
pumpkin
and
spices
is
not
overdone
and
make
for
a
different
but
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
that
was
very
enjoyable
on
thanksgiving
thanks
to
nerofiddled
for
the
sample
of
this
brew
each
year
at
the
grey
lodge
the
anticipation
and
legend
of
this
beer
increases
from
what
i
can
tell
due
to
its
extreme
scarcity
that
is
true
at
a
lot
of
places
this
beer
is
everything
seasonal
beers
should
be
and
should
be
about
and
to
think
two
years
ago
we
got
a
barrel
around
thanksgiving
because
they
couldnt
get
rid
of
it
this
year
all
were
gone
before
halloween
nice
orangecopper
color
with
amber
highlights
pours
with
an
attractive
creamy
head
that
lasts
well
and
leaves
a
nice
lace
the
aroma
has
a
distict
pumpkin
scent
with
nutmeg
and
perhaps
clove
the
taste
is
very
spicy
with
a
subdued
punmpkin
note
it
still
presents
a
nice
malt
flavor
with
hops
noticable
on
the
finish
a
hint
of
sweetness
helps
blend
the
flavors
together
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
typical
for
an
ale
noticable
but
does
not
coat
the
tongue
with
a
relatively
clean
finish
due
to
the
hops
very
enjoyable
thanks
to
nero
for
making
this
sample
available
nice
amber
color
but
unfortunately
not
a
big
head
little
lace
great
taste
though
not
overwhealming
like
some
pumpkin
ales
can
be
not
like
eating
a
slice
but
more
like
putting
your
finger
in
the
batter
and
tasting
cinnamon
clove
nutmeg
and
hops
and
a
finish
that
leaves
you
wanting
to
put
whipped
cream
on
top
yeah
i
liked
this
one
deep
copper
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
good
lace
the
aroma
is
quite
bold
with
nutmeg
and
what
i
perceive
to
be
allspice
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
standard
carbonation
and
a
lightly
zesty
mouthfeel
the
flavor
shows
the
unique
dogfish
head
character
and
starts
with
a
good
blending
of
sweet
malt
spice
reveals
a
myriad
of
spice
flavor
as
it
crosses
the
palate
and
finishes
with
a
dry
and
peppery
spiciness
that
lingers
briefly
bitterness
is
present
but
plays
a
supporting
role
to
the
spice
which
acts
as
the
main
balancing
agent
and
dominant
flavor
the
spices
are
fresh
and
flavorful
much
more
so
than
the
generic
spicing
usually
found
in
pumpkin
beers
and
the
beer
has
a
very
distinct
character
of
its
own
which
usually
cannot
be
said
of
spiced
beers
very
nice
and
well
worth
trying
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
rich
but
there
is
a
significant
alcohol
burn
enjoyable
on
a
cold
night
but
the
alcohol
could
be
more
toned
down
very
tasty
and
satisfying
beer
like
many
other
high
abv
offerings
from
flying
dog
you
can
really
taste
and
feel
the
alcohol
on
this
one
while
the
finish
can
be
a
bit
harsh
its
still
very
drinkable
the
pumpkin
is
just
right
not
cloying
or
artificial
tasting
overall
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
and
much
better
than
i
expected
recommended
o
very
different
from
other
pumpkin
beers
because
the
flavors
are
not
to
much
on
the
pumpkin
side
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
have
had
better

this
brewery

how
to
describe
the
worse
thing
i
have
ever
tired
how
about
someone
threw
up
a
pumpkin
pie
on
a
pine
tree
i
dont
mean
to
be
rude
but
it
was
literally
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
if
you
like
pumpkin
and
you
like
very
hoppy
ipas
then
i
guess
you
might
like
this
obination
if
you
lean
towards
liking
more
malty
beers
and
not
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
stay
far
far
far
away
as
you
should
fear
it
another
fairly
enjoyable
flying
dog
effort
that
was
by
no
means
the
brewerys
best
beer
but
a
good
one
nonetheless
particularly
because
it
was
such
a
big
well
flavoured
beer
that
was
very
nice
to
sit
and
sip
away
at
perhaps
the
alcohol
content
could
have
been
better
hidden
but
it
didnt
take
much
away
from
the
taste
and
it
was
well
worth
trying
without
truly
exciting
moral
of
the
story
is
what
may
appear
to
be
fresh
new
exciting
often
is
not
maybe
im
just
getting
old
opaque
amber
didnt
think
the
head
was
there
until
it
was
overflowing
my
tulip
glass
big
pumpkin
pie
aroma
heavy
spice
taste
is
like
burnt
pumpkin
pie
roasted
malt
is
almost
overwhelming
the
pumpkin
flavor
i
almost
taste
the
bready
crust
of
the
pie
again
the
roasted
malt
too
quickly
takes
over
the
pumpkin
flavor
in
every
sip
this
is
a
pumpkin
stout
in
my
opinion
and
i
dont
much
like
it
this
beer
is
like
christmas
met
halloween
and
had
a
beer
baby
and
it
was
good
spicy
sweet
and
oh
so
tasty
i
think
youll
like
this
beer
a
lot
if
you
have
any
sort
of
sweet
tooth
dont
get
me
wrong
this
isnt
candy
and
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
its
aroma
is
contradictory
slightly
sour
but
with
a
nice
whiff
of
nutmeg
and
maple
sugar
oh
and
pumpkin
of
course
it
tastes
like
maybe
a
brown
ale
and
grandmas
pumpkin
pie
mashed
together
goes
great
with
cold
weather
im
usually
not
a
homer
but
this
beer
was
there
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
a
deep
red
body
off
whitekhaki
head
looks
pretty
legit
the
aroma
is
airy
with
pumpkin
spices
nut
meg
cinnamon
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
toasted
malts
very
pleasing
to
my
nose
the
taste
never
ever
have
i
seen
a
pumpkin
ale
this
dark
wow
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
tinge
of
deep
orange
red
trying
to
peek
through
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
pie
and
spices
and
some
sweetness
the
alcohol
bites
you
at
first
and
then
a
pumpkin
spice
flavor
comes
through
the
alcohol
continues
to
burn
ever
so
slightly
the
flavor
is
decent
but
the
burn
is
amazing
decent
balance
of
flavors
and
overallbesides
the
alcohol
a
pretty
mild
mannered
beer
o
better
than
i
expected
the
brown
ale
was
wellsuited
to
the
pumpkin
bread
flavors
and
spice

and

rough

on

but
a
clean
finish
the
next
5
go
down
well
good
crisp
taste
o
this
is
not
just
a
good
pumpkin
beer
this
is
a
great
imperial
if
you
gave
this
to
me
with
no
pretext
i
would
think
it
was
just
a
really
good
imperial
ipa
very
bitter
lacks
the
palate
taste
i
was
looking
for
also
the
alcohol
is
very
dry
not
very
smooth
or
soothing
heavy
cinnamon
taste
but
a
decent
beer
o
good
stuff
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
my
third
of
the
year
but
my
first
full
bottle
the
second
was
the
schlafly
pumpkin
and
the
first
was
pumking
a
nice
slightly
bitter
ipa
as
in
imperial
pumpkin
ale
nice
molasses
color
and
similar
smell
and
taste
no
real
hints
of
pumpkin
to
me
but
if
i
had
to
drink
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
this
one
im
getting
a
light
pumpkin
taste
its
good
but
it
has
a
strong
sour
note
it
has
fresh
fruity
notes
and
over
all
its
a
good
brew
i
would
still
like
to
see
the
pumpkin
flavor
jacked
up
a
notch
serving
type
keg
line
in
scotland
if
that
makes
a
difference
o
this
one
nearly
hit
on
all
cylinders
but
the
overpowering
sweetness
made
this
one
difficult
to
finish
other
than
that
everything
else
was
on
point
i
have
a
nice
buzz
so
now
i
just
need
something
else
to
rinse
this
taste
out
of
my
mouth
in
summary
fantastic
beer
but
if
you
are
driving
watch
your
intake
because
the
abv
is
twice
your
average
seasonal
or
have
a
designated
driving
and
get
ripped
o
some
odd
disjointed
notes
but
drinkable
and
excellent
handling
of
such
a
high
abv
an
interesting
effort
though
the
spicing
is
a
bit
heavyhanded
looks
good
with
a
nicely
rounded
aroma
of
malt
pumpkin
and
spice
the
flavour
is
ok
but
rather
bitter
with
a
herbal
quality
making
itself
felt
body
is
a
little
insubstantial
for
the
abv
this
brew
packs
plenty
of
charisma
but
lacks
balance
worth
trying
but
probably
not
one
that
id
grab
again
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
vibrant
crystal
clear
toffeebrown
coloring
with
a
thin
sparse
very
light
tan
surface
coat
of
head
great
looking
brew
aromas
of
pumpkin
candied
sugar
cinnamon
nutmeg
bubblegum
and
toasted
grains
very
rich
but
avoids
any
heaviness
in
the
nose
flavors
are
roast
forward
with
a
rich
tangy
caramel
and
toffee
blend
leading
a
roast
pumpkin
character
and
a
healthy
kick
of
booze
very
rich
throughout
and
there
are
hints
of
chocolate
throughout
the
palate
as
well
the
spices
fall
a
bit
out
of
focus
allowing
the
rich
sweet
and
heavy
characteristics
to
run
rampant
on
the
tongue
heavy
on
a
smooth
midbody
with
a
tangy
sweet
and
rich
aftertaste
this
one
stays
strong
throughout
even
into
the
slightly
cloying
slightly
boozy
finish
slight
warming
as
you
drink
solid
flavors
big
beer
overall
this
is
pretty
standard
run
of
the
mill
pumpkin
ale
it
has
some
flavor
to
it
but
the
alcohol
is
obvious
o
overall
the
alcohol
contributes
some
spicenss
and
dry
warmth
but
also
overshadows
at
times
pumpkin
quality
could
of
been
deeper
the
alcohol
soon
settles
and
provides
a
sweet
pumpkin
pie
spice
warmth
o
i
think
this
would
be
better
toned
down
a
notch
on
the
alcohol
there
are
good
spice
flavors
on
top
of
a
brown
ale
back
that
i
enjoy
the
ending
dropped
the
rating
a
notch
the
hoppiness
and
bitterness
really
separates
this
beers
from
other
pumpkin
ales
this
is
really
bitter
and
for
serious
beer
lovers
that
can
take
the
bitterness
in
this
overall
im
glad
to
have
picked
up
a
sixpack
of
this
stuff
i
wasnt
even
aware
of
this
beer
until
tonight
and
though
i
turned
down
a
few
other
pumpkin
ales
there
are
a
lot
nowadays
in
favor
of
this
label
im
glad
i
chose
this
one
overall
incredible
purchase
and
best
one
of
the
night
here
at
tj
finleys
thank
you
for
offering
this

the

nice

feel
though
getting
better
taste
as
it
warms
up
here
o
interesting
take
on
an
often
underperforming
style
imo
spice
profile
is
a
bit
off
the
beaten
track
and
the
hop
factor
is
ramped
up
a
bit
not
up
there
with
the
best
ive
had
but
not
bad
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
some
reviewers
complain
about
the
abundant
hops
but
i
find
that
a
huge
asset
in
a
pumpkin
beer
a
style
i
tend
not
to
prefer
its
superior
to
dog
fish
heads
pumpkin
which
is
overly
spiced
way
too
sweet
and
tastes
like
a
ginger
snap
cookie
otherwise
stay
clear
there
are
more
friendly
pumpkin
beers
out
there
overall
after
smelling
this
one
thought
eh
average
but
after
sipping
on
it
found
myself
enjoying
the
fullness
of
it
not
sure
why
the
nose
is
not
bigger
might
pick
more
of
these
up
for
a
heavier
pumpkin
brew
overall
a
bit
harsh
in
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
but
the
smell
is
pleasant
especially
as
it
warms
strength
of
the
brew
is
hidden
well
though
its
rare
that
im
really
disappointed
with
a
pumpkin
ale
but
this
one
just
doesnt
work
the
only
thing
going
for
it
is
its
unusual
appearancea
dark
brown
color
with
a
beautiful
red
thrown
in
there
too
and
a
head
that
displays
fairly
poor
retention
from
there
things
go
down
hill
the
smell
consists
of
roasted
malt
and
pumpkin
with
the
malt
distracting
rather
than
complimenting
the
pumpkin
in
the
taste
the
roasted
malt
pumpkin
alcohol
and
spices
just
dont
work
and
leave
a
bittersweet
mess
a
cross
between
a
porter
and
a
pumpkin
ale
may
have
sounded
good
on
paper
but
i
found
this
disappointing
and
one
of
the
worst
tasting
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
despite
the
nice
appearance
and
mouthfeel
an
imperial
pumpkin
these
are
becoming
popular
the
beer
is
a
rich
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
soapy
clear
the
smell
is
of
pie
spice
and
booze
malt
comes
out
in
a
big
way
slightly
roasted
and
a
little
breads
no
pumpkin
in
the
smell
in
the
taste
however
there
are
pumpkin
favors
nestled
within
a
serious
alcohol
warming
big
spice
bite
and
malty
sweetness
full
and
thick
in
body
huge
booziness
long
and
spicy
finish
great
pumpkin
beer
o
this
reminds
me
that
while
there
are
a
few
rocksolid
beers
from
this
brewery
like
raging
bitch
some
of
their
other
stuff
is
painfully
mediocre
like
this
actually
no
it
kind
of
sucks
will
not
be
buying
again
overall
a
nice
variation
of
the
typical
pumpkin
beers
with
the
roasted
malt
oa
good
but
not
great
pumpkin
beer
still
cant
be
the
king
pumpkin
beers
are
one
of
my
very
favorite
styles
second
only
to
a
good
west
coast
or
imperial
ipa
there
are
so
many
great
pumpkin
beers
out
there
some
very
mild
and
not
really
pumpkiny
at
all
some
are
way
overdone
to
the
point
where
we
must
ask
ourselves
if
they
are
beer
at
all
or
are
they
liquefied
pumpkin
pie
and
then
there
is
the
fear
a
perfectly
balanced
pumpkin
ale
that
is
deceptively
smooth
and
delightfully
drinkable
despite
the
9
abv
the
traditional
pumpkin
and
spices
are
definitely
all
there
but
subtle
enough
to
allow
the
taste
of
an
american
strong
ale
to
come
through
bravo
to
flying
dog
for
making
a
truly
fantastic
fall
seasonal
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
a
little
tingle
from
the
booze
and
hops
it
seems
a
bit
thin
though
bought

md
sorry
to
say
that
ive
missed
this
one
before
poured
into
blue
moon
glass
i
know
sorryfirst
thing
i
found
shows
small
head
on
top
deep
amber
black
pour
lace
follows
glass
down
smell
is
least
pleasant
part
of
beer
swamp
water
with
spice
however
things
get
better
as
beer
has
warm
spicy
mouthfeel
but
individual
spices
dont
stand
out
and
overwhelm
i
think
cinnamon
coriander
nutmeg
has
an
almost
gummy
consistency
as
you
drink
it
down
hides
the
high
abv
well
you
know
something
is
there
but
the
monster
doesnt
exactly
jump
out
of
the
bushes
you
know
what
i
mean
tastes
better
as
you
goalthough
theres
a
bit
of
an
acidic
aftertaste
all
in
all
very
good
as
a
onesie
dont
know
about
multiples
d
this
was
not
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
the
scent
and
body
were
ok
but
the
taste
wasnt
ok
the
finish
was
rough
too
so
it
was
not
easy
to
drink
not
recommended
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
the
robustness
of
flavoring
while
that
central
bite
was
certainly
overpowering
at
times
at
no
point
was
the
drinker
bored
at
first
things
did
feel
onedimensional
but
with
time
and
warmth
the
ending
of
the
swallow
flourished
with
a
mix
of
bitters
and
spices
this
made
for
an
ultimately
interesting
drink
this
beer
does
not
land
well
within
the
stylistic
guidelines
as
much
of
anything
pumpkin
is
lost
but
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
more
forward
beers
for
flying
dog
overall
a
rather
nice
roasty
at
first
and
sweeter
and
balanced
pumpkin
flavor
in
this
one
a
good
example
of
an
imperial
pumpkin
brew
and
one
to
try
if
you
have
the
chance
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
again
at
2
50
bottle
but
i
also
would
not
refuse
one
if
offered
this
isnt
really
the
best
imperial
pumpkin
ale
ive
come
across
too
bitter
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
i
was
hoping
for
more
considering
flying
dog
really
excels
with
their
bigger
beers
overall
this
was
a
pretty
big
miss
for
me
it
was
drinkable
when
it
was
on
the
colder
side
but
as
it
warmed
the
flavor
profile
got
spice
heavy
and
earthywoodyroasty
for
some
reason
the
base
beer
is
caught
between
an
amber
and
a
porter
which
just
doesnt
work
i
was
actually
expecting
there
would
be
more
pumpkin
than
i
tasted
based
on
the
nose
pass
for
me
a
solid
beer
overall
i
tend
to
prefer
the
darker
pumpkin
beers
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
pretty
well
worth
trying
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
to
brownish
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
pumpkin
cinnamon
allspice
brown
sugar
and
a
small
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
somewhat
boozy
small
spices
but
mostly
allspice
a
spice
like
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
spice
and
lingering
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
somewhat
boozy
big
spices
and
sweet
to
dry
flavors
the
mouth
feel
is
kinda
heavy
but
well
carbonated
and
overall
i
would
put
this
in
the
top
10
of
pumpkin
beers
the
perfect
beer
for
the
day
i
guess
poured
roasted
chesnut
color
with
a
tinge
of
amberalmost
no
head
to
speak
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
big
sweet
alcohol
in
the
nosea
booze
bomb
spiced
with
an
undelying
sweet
alcohol
element
that
is
omni
presentthe
flavors
are
not
bad
with
the
spice
being
dominantthe
alcohol
gets
even
bigger
as
the
beer
warms
there
are
better
imperial
pumpkin
ales
out
there
that
are
not
as
hotits
not
awful
though
medium
bodied
with
more
roast
and
hop
bitterness
than
the
atom
suggests
roasted
malt
presence
long
with
dry
earthy
hops
and
toasted
pumpkin
seed
this
dry
roasted
character
takes
away
from
the
better
qualities
of
the
beer
in
my
opinion
there
is
still
a
stron
zesty
autumnal
spice
profile
but
most
of
the
pumpkin
pie
sweetness
found
in
the
aroma
is
overpowered
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
along
with
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
clove
with
some
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
puree
buried
underneath
the
high
abv
is
very
well
masked
but
i
wish
it
was
better
balanced
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
out
there
but
this
just
might
earn
a
spot
in
the
top
5
this
brew
doesnt
knock
you
over
the
head
with
pumpkin
flavor
but
how
well
flying
dog
managed
to
execute
all
the
other
flavors
especially
the
nice
hop
bite
in
the
finish
makes
this
definitely
worth
at
least
a
try
its
like
someone
mixed
a
pumpkin
ale
with
a
harvest
ale
and
then
added
some
more
hops
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
full
bodied
feel
spot
on
carbonation
at
a
medium
level
slightly
drying
with
spice
and
malt
notes
lingering
into
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
take
on
a
dark
pumpkin
ale
big
and
tasty
worthy
of
provoking
the
fear
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
good
i
think
it
could
have
used
more
pumpkin
to
be
called
a
pumpkin
ale
but
it
was
tasty
this
pumpkin
ale
has
strong
pumpkin
spicing
without
leaving
behind
the
beer
aspect
it
has
a
touch
of
smoke
and
a
hop
touch
that
add
to
the
complexity
the
alcohol
is
apparent
so
be
ready
for
the
9
abv
though
it
doesnt
interfere
in
the
beers
aspects
not
quite
the
pumpkin
pie
beer
that
others
are
this
one
has
the
strong
pumpkin
spicing
but
has
a
unique
character
to
it
as
well
that
makes
this
one
worth
trying
and
enjoyable
welldone
the
body
is
medium
and
pretty
full
at
that
crispness
is
light
and
constant
balancing
nicely
with
an
equally
constant
smoothness
dryness
pulls
into
the
finish
overall
great
pumpkin
beer
was
thoroughly
surprised
with
this
creative
bold
and
something
i
expected
from
flying
dog
a
different
approach
to
a
pumpkin
ale
works
pretty
well
sweet
like
some
pumpkin
ales
but
the
smokey
and
bitter
notes
take
it
somewhere
else
i
like
this
pretty
good
and
would
have
it
again
surprisingly
light
for
9
abv
but
still
on
the
heavy
side
of
being
medium
bodied
lots
of
spice
with
a
big
roasted
malt
profile
and
a
nice
pumpkin
flavor
to
it
unfortunately
the
spice
really
dominates
this
beer
to
the
point
of
lingering
in
the
mouth
the
nice
roastiness
of
the
malt
however
compliments
the
pumpkin
pretty
well
a
bit
of
a
sloppy
beer
but
a
pretty
good
effort
and
i
complement
the
brewery
for
using
this
years
fresh
pumpkins
could
use
some
work
but
drinkable
and
overall
tasty
enough
o
this
dark
pumpkin
is
hard
to
compare
to
most
others
in
the
style
the
roasty
char
character
pairs
wonderfully
with
the
pumpkin
and
spices
this
is
a
great
imperial
pumpkin
i
will
seek
out
again
an
amazing
take
on
the
style
very
unique
in
comparison
to
most
with
that
being
said
its
not
the
best
but
very
complex
and
still
an
amazing
beer
o
a
tasty
pumpkin
beer
but
the
burnt
flavor
brings
it
down
some
worth
trying
and
i
will
pick
this
up
again
overall
cant
say
its
the
worst
pumpkin
beer
i
had
but
it
kind
of
makes
me
regret
buying
two
since
i
could
have
had
another
devious
an
rather
poor
attempt
at
a
pumpkin
stoutporter
the
booze
is
pretty
apparent
the
dark
qualities
are
not
rich
enough
meh
o
this
could
have
been
a
good
pumpkin
ale
if
it
wasnt
hindered
by
flavors
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
o
i
really
wish
that
there
was
just
a
hint
more
pumpkin
flavoraroma
and
that
the
alcohol
was
a
little
more
well
hidden
i
like
the
fact
that
there
is
very
little
sweetness
to
this
pumpkin
not
the
easiest
to
drink
and
i
will
likely
skip
this
one
next
year
i
would
describe
this
more
as
a
fallautumn
beer
than
a
pumpkin
beer
mouthfeel
is
nice
velvety
full
bodied
light
soft
carbonation
a
little
chewy
good
but
nothing
amazing
had
on
cask
at
maxs
in
baltimore
love
me
some
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
was
just
about
average
beer
i
think
the
lack
of
carbonation
kind
of
killed
the
overall
appeal
for
me
i
would
be
curious
to
try
a
noncask
version
of
this
mouthfeel
and
body
are
a
little
off
the
usual
nutmeg
and
allspice
and
cinnamon
tastes
but
the
alcohol
is
very
prominent
and
just
doesnt
seem
well
balanced
worthy
of
a
try
but
just
average
in
my
book
when
compared
to
the
elites
greater
pumpkin
punkin
et
al
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
one
of
the
best
ive
had
i
would
highly
reccomend
this
o
the
fear
is
aptly
named
strong
dark
spicey
it
chases
you
along
the
whole
drink
the
alcohol
and
pumpkin
work
well
together
on
the
finish
i
wanted
to
give
this
one
an
overall
of
3
8
but
i
rounded
it
up
to
4
0
by
default
of
the
rating
options
this
one
is
real
fun
i
love
the
description
on
the
label
about
fear
and
halloween
really
makes
for
an
exciting
journey
into
my
stomach
the
main
thing
that
stands
out
in
or
maybe
i
should
say
jumps
out
of
this
pumpkin
ale
for
me
is
the
extreme
spice
received
when
washing
it
down
i
personally
enjoy
it
and
the
slightly
higher
alcohol
content
helps
make
it
something
more
special
and
provides
a
prewinter
warming
bite
to
it
it
has
delightful
mouth
feel
very
frothy
and
sort
of
thick
coats
the
inside
of
your
mouth
with
all
that
autumn
spice
i
drank
this
with
a
pumpkin
whoopie
pie
from
whole
foods
and
i
tell
you
the
combination
of
the
pumpkin
dessert
washed
down
by
the
fear
was
so
delightful
i
almost
keeled
over
with
joy
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
to
drink
with
pumpkin
related
desserts
cookies
pound
cakes
pumpkin
butter
battered
croissantsseriously
drink
this
one
with
your
favorite
pumpkin
sweets
on
the
palate
its
more
of
the
same
again
cinnamon
again
vanilla
darker
malts
some
of
the
9
rearing
its
head
yeah
a
wee
bit
boozy
but
i
tend
to
like
boozy
and
hey
it
is
9
tastes
sort
of
like
double
bastard
infused
with
a
hint
and
a
half
of
fall
spices
and
with
less
hops
and
less
body
not
really
getting
much
actual
pumpkin
flavor
or
character
o
not
a
normal
time
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
really
enjoyable
and
drinkable
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
it
is
a
solid
fall
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
nearly
opaque
but
not
quite
as
dark
as
a
stout
very
little
visible
carbonation
but
can
be
seem
bubbling
at
the
top
small
offwhite
head
with
decent
clinging
smells
strongly
of
nutmeg
spice
and
caramel
not
overly
noticeable
pumpkin
smell
this
is
more
of
a
fall
spice
beer
than
typical
pumpkin
ales
definitely
a
warming
spiced
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
a
spiced
pumpkin
coffee
drink
more
than
pie
strong
but
not
overly
boozy
alcohol
this
is
a
nice
alternative
to
other
pumpkin
beers
i
would
go
back
to
this
next
fall
an
interesting
pumpkin
beer
lots
of
spice
and
a
multidimensional
pumpkin
flavor
the
spices
and
sweetness
are
good
not
my
favorite
not
entirely
suited
to
my
tastes
but
i
still
appreciate
some
of
the
complexities
here
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
pumpkin
ale
and
was
really
easy
to
drink
for
9
abv
loads
of
cinnamon
in
the
taste
would
definitely
order
it
again
sometime
actually
got
this
right
as
it
kicked
but
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
was
still
good
poured
a
dark
chestnut
brown
hazy
with
a
large
rocky
tan
head
aroma
of
grains
and
pumpkin
pie
spice
quite
earthy
taste
more
of
the
spice
than
the
pumpkin
with
a
good
amount
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
even
a
hint
of
basil
i
thought
thick
with
malts
and
a
bit
earthy
with
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
medium
mouthfeel
chewy
not
too
bad
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
this
season
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
small
beige
foam
picked
up
some
usual
pumpkin
spices
in
the
aromacloves
i
think
but
got
a
whiff
of
bananaflavored
bubble
gum
taste
is
a
little
spicy
with
hints
of
graham
crackers
packs
a
nice
alcohol
bite
and
has
a
tingly
mouthfeel
taste
is
only
fintly
of
pumpkin
and
spice
perhaps
the
reason
for
the
generally
low
reviews
just
enough
piney
hops
to
balance
the
sweetness
with
none
of
the
metalic
taste
the
is
an
issue
for
me
in
higher
alcohol
beers
a
spice
bomb
of
a
beer
that
doesnt
taste
bad
but
is
in
desperate
need
of
depth
and
subtlety
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
with
good
retention
aromas
are
equal
parts
roasty
spicy
and
pumpkinpacked
the
taste
however
beats
you
over
the
head
with
spices
how
much
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
cloves
can
your
mouth
stand
in
a
single
sip
if
it
werent
for
the
redemptive
roastiness
and
burst
of
black
licorice
that
lingers
on
the
immediate
finish
id
consider
its
flavor
to
be
below
average
fifteen
minutes
later
my
mouth
still
tastes
like
i
just
smoked
a
pack
of
djarum
blacks
clove
cigs
as
a
nonsmoker
i
dont
consider
this
an
endearing
quality
this
was
a
bit
of
a
mixed
bag
i
liked
the
attempt
at
the
complexity
and
size
here
but
the
more
aggressive
aspects
of
this
mainly
the
roast
and
alcohol
just
got
to
be
a
bit
wearing
after
a
while
its
not
horrible
by
any
means
but
definitely
needs
to
be
toned
down
a
bit
to
ultimately
be
more
enjoyable
some
reviewers
complain
about
the
abundant
hops
but
i
find
that
an
asset
in
a
pumpkin
beer
a
style
i
tend
not
to
prefer
its
superior
to
dog
fish
heads
pumpkin
which
is
overly
spiced
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
an
orange
hue
there
is
the
aroma
of
some
spice
but
there
is
not
a
very
strong
nose
to
this
beer
which
is
surprising
considering
it
is
certainly
a
big
beer
the
upfront
flavor
is
very
bold
and
is
accompanied
by
a
pie
spice
finish
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
as
well
unfortunately
i
did
not
pick
up
any
pumpkin
in
this
beer
this
beer
is
big
and
bold
however
it
suffers
because
it
is
a
pumpkin
ale
with
no
pumpkin
taste
o
this
is
a
the
worst
imperial
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
and
this
is
number
5
maybe
i
was
spoiled
by
having
southern
tier
schlafly
weyerbacher
and
heavy
seas
but
a
crap
beer
is
a
crap
beer
when
your
expecting
something
spectacular
and
you
get
this
you
get
pissed
i
am
so
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
6r
of
this
o
rarely
do
i
drainpour
something
but
this
met
the
bill
i
let
it
rest
and
warm
it
didnt
matter
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
to
begin
with
but
to
date
they
have
all
been
tolerable
this
beer
was
definitely
a
halloween
trick
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
big
and
bold
take
on
the
style
it
flirts
with
disaster
as
far
as
being
too
spiced
for
my
liking
but
it
overall
ends
up
being
enjoyable
because
it
is
balanced
the
aggressive
spicing
was
needed
to
keep
the
bold
character
of
this
brew
in
check
while
i
really
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
give
this
one
a
try
it
wasnt
easy
to
finish
the
full
12oz
it
is
something
that
you
should
try
if
you
get
the
chance
but
i
think
it
would
be
much
more
enjoyable
if
it
was
toned
down
just
a
bit
pours
a
fairlydark
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
moderate
lace
nose
brings
forward
some
nice
pumpkin
spice
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
roast
the
flavor
blends
the
pumpkin
and
porter
characteristics
quite
well
a
bit
of
booze
though
not
much
medium
body
with
good
roast
and
spice
well
done
i
like
this
pumpkin
substyle
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
mildly
bitter
at
the
back
but
the
pumpkin
flavor
comes
through
well
and
clear
i
enjoy
the
beer
overall
and
for
a
pumpkin
porter
or
whatever
this
is
it
is
quite
good
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
if
i
were
thirsty
and
the
only
thing
on
tap
id
prefer
this
to
water
in
a
pinch
is
what
im
saying
overall
not
sure
if
this
is
a
bad
bottle
or
just
doesnt
taste
good
but
im
not
a
fan
skål
nearly
black
in
color
with
brownish
hues
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
poured
with
a
short
beige
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
soapy
cap
that
drapes
sheets
of
wet
lacings
on
the
glass
thick
creamy
smooth
feel
sweet
pumpkin
aroma
with
a
lightly
roasted
malt
aroma
beneath
sweet
pumpkin
flavor
up
front
and
into
the
middle
with
a
floral
hop
bitterness
in
tow
that
continues
to
grow
to
the
finish
hop
bitterness
gives
way
to
a
brief
pumpkin
sweetness
at
the
finish
that
leaves
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
the
imperial
nature
of
this
beer
is
very
apparent
from
the
middle
to
the
end
this
was
damn
good
a
truly
unique
spin
on
pumpkin
ale
o
a
little
too
much
upfront
spice
not
enough
actual
pumpkin
flavor
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
o
this
was
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
im
glad
to
see
flying
dog
branching
out
with
a
few
new
beers
the
spices
may
have
been
too
big
and
i
could
taste
more
alcohol
than
id
like
the
beer
pours
a
brownish
amber
color
with
minimal
head
retention
and
very
little
lacing
the
nose
is
spice
filled
with
considerable
clove
allspice
and
nutmeg
the
flavor
profile
replicaates
the
nose
in
this
fairly
sweet
beer
and
once
again
im
impressed
by
the
amount
of
spice
in
the
beer
the
cask
condition
tones
it
down
somewhat
but
this
is
still
a
clove
and
vanilla
driven
seasonal
from
fd
mouthfeel
is
fairly
soft
with
the
low
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
seems
a
bit
more
noticeable
as
well
nevertheless
this
is
an
spice
infused
interesting
interpretation
of
a
pumpkin
ale
though
a
little
bit
goes
a
long
way
im
thinking
one
and
done
with
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
of
the
style
but
it
didnt
really
bring
anything
new
or
outstanding
to
the
table
the
spices
seemed
to
dominate
a
little
too
much
for
me
as
well
a
good
beer
but
not
an
outstanding
one
orange
brown
pour
with
a
white
head
the
lacing
and
retention
is
great
pumpkin
vanilla
spices
some
roasted
malty
aroma
sort
of
a
weird
smell
the
taste
is
malty
roasted
sort
of
boozy
really
no
hint
of
pumpkin
or
spiciness
disjointed
and
like
the
smell
is
weird
tasting
light
carbonated
well
just
not
balanced
at
all
the
strange
smell
and
flavor
makes
this
difficult
to
drink
disappointed
in
this
o
overall
this
really
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
had
pumpkin
ales
arent
among
my
favorite
styles
but
i
will
definitely
buy
some
more
of
these
if
i
come
across
them
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
decent
carbonation
and
lacing
very
dark
for
a
pumpkin
ale
nose
is
a
lot
of
spice
pumpkin
nutmeg
cinnamon
allspice
lacking
in
complexity
and
depth
for
me
taste
is
the
same
its
decent
just
not
great
too
heavy
on
the
spices
and
a
little
dry
and
thin
as
well
theres
way
too
much
allspice
in
this
for
me
i
just
couldnt
get
past
that
feel
was
better
medium
body
but
a
little
too
dry
and
earthy
for
me
overall
this
was
decent
but
i
wasnt
knocked
out
by
it
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
fairly
high
this
just
has
nothing
worth
talking
about
o
if
you
ask
me
this
is
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
no
joke
a
really
great
fall
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
i
am
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
taste
it
i
cant
say
that
ill
ever
cellar
a
pumpkin
beer
again
ive
heard
where
spices
seem
to
subside
and
i
can
see
firsthand
that
is
true
light
in
body
and
full
of
alcohol
flavors
very
dry
on
the
finish
and
earthy
with
that
same
anise
that
was
in
the
aroma
pumpkin
all
spice
nutmeg
and
some
other
herbal
flavors
i
like
where
they
are
trying
to
go
but
just
too
boozy
more
viscosity
could
have
helped
i
purchased
a
single
bottle
at
rodmans
dc
today
pours
dark
brown
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
it
has
a
fabulous
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
it
has
a
silky
mouth
feel
with
a
nice
after
taste
not
as
good
as
the
dfh
pumpkin
but
a
great
substitute
i
would
recommend
this
beer
and
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
all
that
said
i
still
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
big
and
bold
and
even
though
the
pumpkin
doesnt
shine
through
it
does
add
a
layer
of
complexity
to
an
already
complex
beer
i
would
buy
this
again
great
appearance
with
a
dark
ruby
brown
color
a
thin
head
sits
on
top
of
this
gorgeous
beer
it
smells
of
sweet
malts
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
first
sip
blows
me
away
it
reminds
me
of
pumking
with
less
sweetness
and
more
rich
maltiness
as
i
work
my
way
through
the
glass
the
beer
warms
showing
more
pumpkin
flavor
along
with
the
subtle
spices
nice
balance
between
the
pumpkin
malts
and
light
spice
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
excellent
beer
like
a
darker
pumking
perfect
for
enjoying
on
a
cool
fall
evening
outside
around
the
campfire
great
spice
aroma
and
taste
good
pumpkin
flavor
o
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
on
the
market
the
original
imperial
pumpkin
ale
certainly
set
the
bar
high
above
average
to
good
pumpkin
beer
that
hits
all
the
traditional
notes
full
of
cinnamon
clove
and
bread
with
a
small
hoppy
backbone
definitely
worth
a
try
appearance
hold
an
amber
orange
color
supporting
a
thin
moderate
head
leaving
fair
lace
smell
has
that
nice
aroma
of
pumpkin
and
accompanying
spice
taste
does
not
disappoint
having
that
night
owl
flavor
but
more
expressive
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
good
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
22oz
bomber
this
one
poured
a
cloudy
darker
golden
color
there
was
a
small
off
white
head
which
didnt
leave
much
lacing
the
nose
is
good
pumpkin
plus
some
pumpkin
pie
spices
the
spices
are
not
overdone
the
taste
is
good
it
is
a
bit
sweet
but
thankfully
not
sickly
sweet
as
some
others
of
these
are
good
body
pumpkin
as
well
as
pumpkin
pie
spices
not
bad
if
you
are
experimenting
pumpkin
beers
or
if
you
believe
this
year
is
the
year
that
you
will
make
a
breakthrough
with
them
let
me
advise
you
not
to
reach
for
this
one
perhaps
more
for
the
experienced
pumpkin
beer
drinker
im
no
pumpkin
beer
aficionado
but
this
is
damn
tasty
or
should
i
say
yam
tasty
no
no
i
should
not
thats
a
terrible
pun
o
this
is
truly
a
great
pumpkin
beer
the
flavor
and
aromas
are
strong
and
inviting
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
in
the
end
more
of
a
spicy
dessert
brew
towards
pumking
a
good
pumpkin
ale
certainly
in
the
upper
echelon
but
i
wish
it
did
a
bit
more
to
distinguish
itself
from
others
in
the
same
style
deep
golden
with
a
slight
haze
and
minimal
head
aroma
is
spices
from
a
cookie
or
pumpkin
pie
flavor
follows
with
those
spices
in
the
lead
but
not
overdone
theyre
joined
by
pumpkin
and
malts
but
there
seems
to
be
a
slight
off
flavor
to
me
maybe
it
just
the
pumpkin
but
whatever
it
is
doesnt
quite
fit
a
good
beer
but
not
one
id
need
another
of
overall
i
have
to
say
that
this
really
was
a
good
beer
to
definitely
have
again
i
am
thinking
about
picking
another
one
of
these
up
for
thanksgiving
d
not
very
drinkable
for
me
and
highly
disappointed
based
on
the
nose
as
well
as
the
other
great
experiences
ive
had
with
elysian
including
punkuccino
dragonstooth
and
the
almighty
dayglow
ipa
if
you
dont
like
over
top
pumpkin
flavor
this
could
be
the
beer
for
you
but
i
feel
it
really
has
some
off
putting
qualities
to
the
flavor
this
beer
is
heavy
on
the
spice
but
the
sweetness
balances
it
out
well
it
has
a
great
strong
aroma
and
is
enjoyable
despite
the
strong
spices
pumpkin
finishes
out
the
beer
in
a
fuzzy
and
distractingly
tacky
feel
alcohol
is
very
gently
warming
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
regardless
this
was
one
of
the
better
versions
ive
had
in
some
time
o
a
great
pumpkin
ale
overall
definitely
one
of
the
best
ive
had
the
beer
appears

lots

thin

one

10
pumpkin
beers
smooth
rich

not
watery
like
many
of
the
pumpkins
out
there
too
bad
beers
like
this
are
available
for
such
a
short
period
a
quality
pumpkin
ale
that
delivers
what
one
would
expect
from
the
style
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
i
think
i
might
like
the
night
owl
from
elysian
just
a
tad
more
owhat
a
great
smelling
beer
the
scent
is
really
the
highlight
here
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
isnt
bad
if
you
like
your
pumpkin
beer
on
the
dryer
side
this
brew
is
a
good
choice
because
it
still
provides
some
spice
and
pumpkin
flesh
without
getting
vegetal
or
overly
earthy
i
could
use
a
bit
more
heft
in
the
feel
but
this
is
not
quaffable
by
any
means
wow
what
a
great
smelling
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
would
put
in
my
top
three
pumpkin
brews
so
far
good
gourd
pumpking
and
great
pumpkin
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
that
there
are
this
one
actually
tastes
like
beer
overall
this
is
pretty
much
one
of
the
highest
rated
pumpkin
ales
but
its
not
my
piece
of
pie
i
can
drink
it
fine
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
22
ounces
is
too
much
for
me
definitely
worth
a
try
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
and
tasty
imperial
pumpkin
ale
a
little
on
the
drier
side
and
more
roasted
pumpkin
in
nature
with
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
and
a
great
feel
overall
i
was
dubious
about
pumpkin
beer
with
several
misfires
extending
back
a
few
years
i
even
thought
that
i
might
not
even
like
pumpkin
beer
even
though
i
love
pumpkin
pie
this
beer
really
does
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
the
price
was
moderately
steep
but
not
outrageous
at
4
99
for
a
bomber
bought
at
the
albertsons
in
livingston
montana
bravo
to
the
brewmeisters
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
nice
flavor
and
body
easy
to
like
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
and
well
worth
trying
overall
this
beer
is
quite
nice
and
a
nice
representation
of
what
i
believe
a
pumpkin
beer
should
be
like
id
give
it
3

this
beer
lives
up
to
its
name
this
really
is
a
great
pumpkin
ale
poured
from
a
22oz
into
a
goblet
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
kind
of
remeniscent
of
my
childhood
orange
crush
vice
just
a
little
more
rustic
looking
smells
delicious
cinnamon
nutmeg
gingerbread
cola
cherry
and
pumpkin
no
alcohol
on
the
nose
at
all
pumpkin
flavor
is
heavier
in
the
taste
but
i
think
the
flavor
is
really
well
balanced
overall
just
a
nice
mosaic
of
spices
and
fruit
sweet
bitter
on
the
back
end
and
nice
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
an
8
abv
and
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
not
as
heavy
as
you
might
think
best
imperial
pumpkin
ive
ever
had
it
seems
pretty
light
as
far
as
abv
but
coats
the
mouth
very
nicely
the
taste
lingers
on
the
palate
a
while
adding
that
slight
pinch
of
aforementioned
bitterness
as
with
elysians
other
pumpkin
ales
i
would
highly
recommend
this
one
for
the
fall
season
onice
pumpkin
ale
with
good
pumkin
flavor
and
a
nice
spice
balance
a
little
hot
though
i
need
to
try
good
gourde
but
this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
that
i
have
tried
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
the
spice
is
a
bit
heavy
handed
but
isnt
a
deal
breaker
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
as
i
said
its
a
little
bit
overwhelming
for
me
i
like
my
pumpkin
beers
a
little
bit
more
on
the
subtle
side
decent
but
hardly
a
session
drink
great
beer
i
love
pumpkins
this
bad
boy
is
up
there
with
the
champions
overall
the
great
pumpkin
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
but
it
cannot
stand
up
to
the
likes
of
pumpking
that
said
i
have
heard
that
previous
vintages
of
the
great
pumpkin
have
been
better
than
the
2012
so
i
might
have
to
revisit
it
again
in
the
future
mouthfeel
is
on
lighter
side
of
style
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
unique
in
the
style
i
liked
the
low
spice
and
that
the
real
pumpkin
and
squash
flavors
seemed
to
come
out
more
in
it
overall
this
is
a
great
imperial
pumpkin
ale
that
trumps
out
even
the
legendary
pumking
heck
i
think
its
even
better
than
smashed
pumpkin
which
some
craft
lovers
raved
about
i
may
have
to
grab
another
before
they
are
gone
all
in
all
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
and
much
better
than
some
atrocities
ive
had
o
the
smell
was
to
die
for
the
taste
failed
me
in
what
was
going
to
become
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
i
like
this
one
so
you
know
it
must
be
good
since
i
typically
cant
stand
pumpkin
beers
o
this
was
my
second
favorite
from
the
elysian
pumpkin
series
box
and
was
a
soild
pumpkin
beer
impressive
balance
in
this
big
brew
nice
showing
from
the
pumpkin
but
theres
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
spice
their
pumpkin
stout
dark
of
the
moon
is
better
overall
a
very
good
but
thinner
bodied
imperial
pumpkin
ale
easy
to
quaff
definitely
worth
trying
this
one
a
big
pumpkin
beer
huge
spices
but
enough
malt
and
real
pumpkin
to
balance
it
hits
every
flavor
a
pumpkin
beer
could
have
and
remains
drinkable
not
as
solid
as
night
owl
but
for
an
imperial
take
its
damn
good
this
is
a
tasty
pumpkin
ale
its
nicely
balanced
and
not
extreme
in
any
way
this
is
both
a
positive
and
a
negative
some
pumpkin
ales
try
way
too
hard
while
this
doesnt
it
also
isnt
particularly
mindblowing
overall
another
really
good
pumpkin
beer
from
elysian
overall
its
good
pumpkin
beers
are
hit
and
miss
with
me
but
somehow
this
one
tows
the
line
thanks
for
bringin
this
guy
4daloveofstout
overall
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
was
so
excited
to
grab
one
of
the
last
bottles
of
the
season
from
my
local
spot
upon
first
sip
this
beer
kept
the
pumpkin
flavor
true
and
went
down
pretty
smooth
with
the
alcohol
hint
on
the
aftertaste
only
bad
thing
is
i
cant
enjoy
this
again
unless
i
run
back
right
now
which
i
may
do
totally
recommended

closely

the

flavors
are
all
very
complimentary
of
each

and
in
good

nice
fresh
pumpkin
taste
that
is
at
just
the
right
intensity
augmented
by
the
aforementioned
nutmeg

cinnamon
flavors
think
pumpkin
pie
with
a

the

mouthfeel
is
smooth

with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
keep
things
from
tasting
too
syrupy
overall
one
of
the
much
more
successful
pumpkin
brews
out
there
good
festive
flavor
for
this
time
of

cheers
lampertland
d
a
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
upper
echelon
without
a
doubt
but
not
as
epic
as
i
was
hoping
for
still
falls
slightly
short
of
my
favorites
int
he
category
however
i
will
gladly
indulge
each
and
every
fall
and
recommend
you
do
the
same
overall
just
a
really
refreshing
pumpkin
beer
the
spices
are
not
overwhelming
or
unbalanced
which
can
be
the
downfall
of
many
pumpkin
beers
tastes
like
a
desert
somehow
without
being
cloying
sweet
in
the
least
o
a
very
tasty
pumpkin
beer
flavors
come
together
very
well
will
pick
this
up
again
o
if
youre
truly
looking
for
pumpkin
pie
head
toward
the
schlafly
corner
however
if
you
want
to
try
a
truly
uniquie
vegetable
beer
seek
this
one
out
a
tasty
pumpkin
beer
its
sweet
but
not
overly
like
the
other
imperial
pumpkins
that
are
out
there
good
spice
profile
but
the
malt
lacks
some
depth
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
to
16oz
chalice
appears
a
hazy
orange
with
little
head
it
has
a
really
awesome
nose
that
makes
me
think
this
what
a
pumpkin
beer
is
supposed
to
smell
like
almost
as
good
as
a
fresh
pumpkin
pie
is
really
good
but
missing
something
that
seperates
great
pumpkin
beers
alcohol
presence
lingers
that
1
is
enough
mouthfeel
is
easy
going
besides
alcohol
detection
medium
carb
if
was
looking
for
imo
pumpkin
and
was
only
option
would
suffice
other
out
there
are
better
but
has
a
good
example
of
style
a
great
great
beer
unique
in
the
pumpkin
ale
world
it
pours
a
shining
orange
to
new
copper
color
with
a
skinny
white
head
that
fades
fast
the
nose
is
spicy
but
not
cinnamon
more
clove
or
even
ginger
or
something
there
also
plenty
of
vanilla
sweetness
and
of
course
pumpkin
the
flavor
is
different
its
made
with
pumpkin
seeds
and
you
can
definitely
taste
the
nutty
earthy
almost
salty
vibe
they
bring
to
the
table
vanilla
sugar
and
spice
is
also
present
and
so
is
the
alcohol
there
is
a
medium
body
a
little
heavy
because
of
the
light
carbonation
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
warmth
this
is
a
great
beer
i
feel
like
the
pumpkin
lends
itself
better
to
imperial
ales
rather
than
smaller
brews
it
just
provides
such
a
big
base
its
a
huge
canvas
on
which
to
paint
and
this
elysian
beer
creates
a
clever
work
this
is
how
i
like
my
pumpkin
ales
good
for
one
or
two
but
way
over
the
top
with
sweetness
and
spice
give
it
a
shot
o
wow
one
of
my
new
favorite
pumpkin
beers
has
the
sweetspicygourd
ratio
down
to
a
science
while
also
having
a
nice
kick
yet
is
still
smooth
o
i
really
like
pumpkin
ales
a
lot
the
style
is
one
i
look
forward
to
and
seek
out
every
year
the
elysian
beers
they
make
several
others
are
always
among
my
favorites
this
is
no
exception
just
a
touch
sweeter
at
times
than
i
like
for
a
pumpkin
beer
then
a
dirty
bitterness
would
rein
it
back
in
terrific
overall
and
definitely
one
ill
keep
drinking
and
recommending
for
a
hypedup
pumpkin
ale
i
found
this
a
bit
lackluster
poured
a
somewhat
cloudy
copperorange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
receded
to
a
ringlet
aroma
was
pretty
soft
and
mellow
with
light
notes
of
pumpkin
and
a
bit
of
cinnamony
spice
taste
was
similarly
mellow
not
an
inyourface
blast
of
pumpkin
pie
but
everything
youd
expect
is
still
there
pumpkin
flesh
cinnamon
nutmeg
allspice
sweet
bready
malts
medium
body
and
quite
easily
drinkable
overall
not
bad
about
on
the
same
level
as
dfhs
punkin
ale
mouthfeel
is
slightly
heavy
and
surprisingly
fizzy
for
something
that
looked
like
it
had
no
head
overall
im
somewhat
underwhelmed
its
not
bad
but
its
not
magic
full
bodied
with
a
zesty
spice
presence
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
pumpkin
and
sweet
malt
notes
into
a
slightly
dry
finish
strong
clove
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
allspice
notes
followed
by
pumpkin
puree
caramel
malt
vanilla
and
nutmeg
very
dessert
like
and
lacking
the
earthy
vegetal
quality
that
makes
so
many
pumpkin
beers
so
unappealing
still
the
strong
autumnal
spices
and
sweet
malts
make
it
feel
like
a
beer
the
high
abv
is
excellently
masked
without
a
trace
of
alcohol
making
this
complex
beer
extremely
quaffable
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
up
there
with
pumpking
and
older
batches
of
southampton
pumpkin
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
had
im
usually
not
as
much
of
a
fan
of
the
imperial
style
and
i
thought
early
on
that
the
alcohol
here
was
going
to
get
this
one
in
trouble
but
i
was
impressed
how
this
pulled
itself
together
once
it
sat
for
a
while
and
the
overall
evenness
of
the
flavors
an
d
freshness
of
that
pumpkin
character
really
carries
this
through
to
the
end
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
this
one
delivered
o
a
fine
pumpkin
beer
that
is
worthy
of
your
money
and
perhaps
your
thanksgiving
table
sweetness
is
balanced
by
alcohol
and
spice
and
the
aroma
is
excellent
for
an
imperial
pumpkin
pretty
light
bodied
and
really
smooth
sweet
ginger
bread
some
vanilla
and
cinnamon
raisin
bread
big
pumpkin
semi
spicy
finish
well
blended
concise
and
tasty
is
it
really
the
original
imperial
pumpkin
who
knows
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
one
overall
as
of
right
now
only
dogfish
head
is
in
the
same
level
as
this
until
i
have
my
first
try
of
the
fabled
pumking
on
halloween
amazing
beer
and
a
steal
for
the
7
99
price
i
bought
it
for
overalls
im
not
a
pumpkinfruit
beer
lover
but
i
loved
this
beer
sweet
as
pumpkin
pie
but
in
a
refined
presentation
stomachwarming
alcohol
complement
great
stuff
very
good
not
must
try
very
easy
drinking
well
hidden
abv
i
personally
dont
think
this
can
stand
up
against
better
imperial
pumpkin
ales
such
as
schlafly
williamsburg
alewerks
st
pumking
or
cc
good
gourd
a
little
too
spice
forward
for
my
tastes
overall
a
wonderfuly
well
crafted
ale
its
all
here
and
done
real
nicely
the
pumking
killer
indeed
i
dont
like
pumpkin
beers
but
i
am
really
enjoying
this
one
i
also
like
the
fact
that
this
doesnt
come
off
that
sweet
in
taste
but
has
all
those
nice
sweet
aromas
this
is
medium
to
full
bodied
there
is
soft
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
take
on
pumpkin
beers
that
doesnt
overly
rely
on
spice
but
instead
real
pumpkin
flavor
not
bad
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
because
it
seems
to
provide
the
perfect
blend
of
pumpkin
and
spices
without
being
overly
sweet
or
tasting
like
pumpkin
pie
no
alcohol
is
present
in
the
taste
great
pumpkin
ale
would
love
to
try
more
from
the
elysian
lineup

a
touch
too
much
going

for
me
to

o
extremely
well

not

sweet
not
too
much
pumpkin
not

this
is
just
a
very
good
beer
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
style
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gourd
colored

with
an
elegant
creamy
white
head
that
laces
the
beers
nose
is
modestly
spiced
with
unexpectedly
potent
notes
of
sweet
yampumpkin
the
taste
doesnt
disappoint
either
with
heavy
pumpkin
sweetness
and
subtle
spices
making
it
like
liquid
pumpkin
pie
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
except
for
a
slight
burn
on
exhalation
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
with
the
pumpkin
and
spice
harmonizing
on
each
sip
followed
by
a
slightly
pinemintlicorice
bitterness
very
enjoyable
beer
and
a
worthy
pumpkin
beer
indeed
completely
worth
trying
and
i
appreciate
the
bottles
unknown
person
i
received
them
from
m
a
bit
sweet
and
thick
suitable
for
the
style
but
not
my
preference
one
bottle
is
enough
flavorful
if
somewhat
unbalanced
bitterness
and
boozy
tastes
a
bit
too
sharp
for
my
tastes
for
this
style
of
beer
yet
i
certainly
like
this
brew
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
overall
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
full
flavor
pumpkin
ale
great
fall
beer
id
definitely
have
more
i
discovered
the
pumpkin
king
in
elysians
pumpkin
patch
fourpack
the
pumpkin
king
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
copper
gold
one
might
even
call
it
pumpkin
orange
like
a
lot
of
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
tried
it
pours
with
very
little
head
so
pour
vigorously
if
you
prefer
some
foam
the
smell
is
strong
pumpkin
pumpkin
spices
and
hops
exactly
what
i
want
a
pumpkin
beer
to
smell
like
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
light
on
the
spices
hidden
behind
the
malts
and
hops
though
they
are
still
there
in
the
form
of
background
notes
which
i
think
adds
to
the
perception
of
complexity
in
the
flavor
the
great
pumpkin
is
definitely
more
nuanced
than
other
beat
you
over
a
head
with
one
spice
or
another
pumpkin
ales
that
are
a
lot
of
fun
to
drink
but
not
what
i
would
describe
as
particularly
delicious
at
8
abv
there
is
a
distinct
medicinal
taste
on
the
back
end
although
this
is
not
unexpected
and
therefore
not
concerning
to
me
at
least
of
course
what
defines
a
pumpkin
ale
is
the
actual
pumpkin
itself
and
im
happy
to
say
that
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
front
and
center
it
helped
to
rest
my
pallet
for
a
few
minutes
before
dipping
in
for
a
few
more
sips
so
that
i
could
experience
the
full
pumpkin
flavor
over
and
over
unlike
a
lot
of
pumpkin
beers
that
ive
tried
the
pumpkin
flavor
was
fresh
and
not
too
vegetablely
i
think
that
the
additional
hops
in
the
imperial
style
compliments
the
pumpkin
flavor
greatly
not
only
to
mask
some
of
the
strong
spice
notes
but
the
floral
and
citrus
flavors
from
the
hops
genuinely
compliment
the
pumpkin
imperial
is
the
way
to
go
for
pumpkin
ales
in
my
opinion
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
as
it
is
1
on
my
list
of
pumpkin
ales
for
now
at
least
came
to
the
table
in
a
goblet
a
deep
pumpkin
orange
color
with
athinner
white
head
atop
aromas
of
cardamom
and
warming
cinnamonthere
is
a
decent
shot
sweet
alcohol
as
wella
little
toast
s
well
more
pumpkin
on
the
palate
than
the
aromas
with
a
bit
of
cooked
pumpkin
and
pie
spiceits
warming
and
the
alcohol
is
pretty
big
this
a
really
good
warming
pumpkin
alenot
overly
sweet
with
some
real
pumpkin
flavors
overall
while
i
havent
had
the
opportunity
to
get
my
hands
on
schlaflys
pumpkin
in
a
couple
of
years
but
i
am
willing
to
say
great
pumpkin
is
on
its
level
o
i
fear
i
am
a
victim
of
the
ba
rating
had
i
never
heard
of
this
beer
at
all
is
say
it
was
average
or
a
little
above
average
i
stand
by
that
conviction
worth
trying
dont
break
your
back
to
get
it
lighter
in
apperance
then
i
would
have
expected
initially
has
a
nice
cap
of
foam
but
it
fades
and
had
no
retention
kind
of
a
orange
clover
honey
color
with
good
clarity
lovely
subdued
aroma
of
pie
spices
such
as
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
as
well
as
toasted
squash
nutty
not
artificial
smelling
which
is
nice
the
flavor
is
very
balanced
spicy
with
cardamom
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
there
is
also
a
real
squash
note
some
bitterness
and
a
good
backbone
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
lingering
bitter
note
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
but
a
very
very
good
one
o
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
for
pumpkin
beer
lovers
although
its
probably
not
my
favorite
within
the
style
the
flavor
has
a
mild
cinnamon
taste
which
increases
with
some
light
bready
malt
and
hint
of
spicy
ginger
with
an
earthy
nutty
toasted
taste
which
suits
the
style
the
middle
gets
spicier
with
some
mild
vanilla
and
sweet
gentle
cotton
candylike
malt
sweetness
with
a
taste
of
alcohol
which
adds
to
the
bite
the
cinnamon
and
clove
elements
provide
overall
a
pretty
tasty
pumpkin
in
the
imperial
realm
very
drinkable
if
a
little
hot
not
an
every
drinking
pumpkin
but
a
good
candidate
for
sharing
and
enjoyable
thanks
a
lot
adam
o
as
with
earlier
in
this
review
the
nutmeg
is
overdone
with
a
nice
warming
cinnamon
presence
the
body
is
great
the
carbonation
is
at
a
good
level
i
prefer
night
owl
as
it
is
a
little
more
subtle
on
spices
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
pumpkin
ale
the
nose
is
amazing
a
ton
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
the
taste
is
a
light
heavier
on
the
spice
but
the
hefty
malt
bill
helps
to
balance
it
out
and
offers
plenty
of
complementary
pempkin
and
caramelbrown
sugar
maltiness
definitely
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
maybe
third
only
behind
weyerbacher
pumpkin
and
midnight
sun
treat
this
is
a
great
execution
of
a
pumpkin
ale
its
a
totally
different
style
but
im
enjoying
it
almost
as
much
as
i
remember
enjoying
night
owl
note
must
try
these
two
side
by
side
and
much
more
than
dark
o
the
moon
overall
this
is
a
different
sort
of
imperial
pumpkin
beer
than
most
out
there
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
most
other
imperials
out
there
which
makes
it
more
interesting
i
am
a
fan
overall
even
though
pumpkin
beers
havent
really
been
my
thing
this
is
probably
the
best
one
ive
had
i
bought
this
because
of
all
the
hubbub
i
heard
heard
and
even
though
i
am
not
a
huge
pumpkin
fan
i
figured
i
might
as
well
orange
color
two
finger
thick
head
fluffy
smells
very
spicy
nutmeg
cinnamon
the
usual
suspects
not
bad
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
but
for
a
split
second
i
thought
i
was
chewing
a
piece
of
cinnamon
gum
like
big
red
or
something
this
was
much
better
than
night
owl
and
honestly
this
probably
was
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
to
date
sadly
though
i
must
still
say
it
was
not
worth
the
9
price
tag
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
i
gotta
tip
my
hat
to
the
folks
at
elysian
for
making
the
most
raw
pumpkin
flavored
beer
i
have
ever
experienced
that
is
to
be
commended
also
the
spiced
inclusion
is
enough
to
let
you
know
it
is
there
and
then
some
however
it
does
not
cross
over
into
the
territory
of
being
ridiculous
and
too
much
for
an
8
brew
it
sure
is
imperial
and
the
alcohol
is
not
hiding
is
it
a
good
pumpkin
beer
yeah
it
certainly
is
among
the
best
bottled
varieties
is
it
the
best
no
selinsgrove
destroys
this
in
overall
blended
flavor
drinkability
and
enjoyment
if
you
want
to
taste
raw
pumpkin
with
a
boost
of
alcohol
this
is
the
beer
to
go
for
i
have
no
reservation
about
my
purchase
i
am
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
i
look
forward
to
having
it
again
closer
to
the
holidays
poured
out
of
22
oz
bottle
dark
orange
pour
with
white
head
aroma
has
notes
of
big
pumpkin
spice
some
caramel
toffee
lots
of
cinnamon
touch
of
nutmeg
some
vegetal
pumpkin
taste
is
an
equal
mix
of
sweet
squashy
pumpkin
flesh
some
slight
cinnamon
ginger
finishing
fairly
sweet
alittle
brown
spicy
not
a
fan
of
the
style
as
a
whole
but
this
one
is
done
pretty
well
would
def
buy
again
44444
5
o
solid
pumpkin
ale
not
the
best
ive
had
but
its
up
there
overall
very
enjoyable
as
it
has
been
every
year
i
have
sampled
it
i
guess
elysian
knows
pumpkin
what
really
separates
this
brew
from
others
in
the
style
is
how
natural
it
tastes
almost
to
the
point
where
you
can
literally
taste
the
pumpkin
seeds
in
the
brew
nothing
artificial
tasting
about
it
just
a
well
crafted
base
beer
with
accompanying
deep
pumpkin
flavors
and
spices
i
found
this
a
lighter
body
than
i
expected
bitter
less
sweet
than
expected
with
a
vegetal
presence
through
the
sip
both
wife
and
i
were
saying
the
smell
really
wowed
us
and
the
taste
was
a
slight
let
down
and
the
mouthfeel
was
deceptive
definitely
getting
some
pumpkin
seed
on
the
finish
but
there
is
just
a
little
lacking
there
in
the
middle
to
transition
from
the
intense
aroma
into
the
actual
beer
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
really
nice
review
from
92010
notes
poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute
glass
pours
a
medium
orange
amber
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
but
light
lacing
pumpkin
and
malt
aroma
pumpkin
pumpkin
pie
spices
light
fruit
and
malt
in
a
nice
combination
complex
and
well
integrated
slightly
bitter
hoppumpkin
finish
probably
from
the
pumpkin
seeds
medium
bodied
with
some
creaminess
excellent
and
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
pumpkin
ale
the
nose
is
amazing
a
ton
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
the
taste
is
a
light
heavier
on
the
spice
but
a
great
pumpkin
beer
none
the
less
and
hope
i
can
get
it
around
thanksgiving
overall
pure
excellence
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
straight
forward
and
features
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
as
expected
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
complex
i
get
the
pumpkin
as
well
as
the
spices
typically
associated
with
pumpkin
beers
cinnamon
allspice
and
nutmeg
the
beer
is
also
quite
boozy
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
normally
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
was
was
awesome
and
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
d
elysian
knows
how
to
make
pumpkin
beers
i
enjoyed
this
nearly
as
much
as
i
did
dark
o
the
moon
i
appreciate
that
they
dont
feel
the
need
to
obliterate
all
the
other
flavors
with
spices
would
happily
have
this
again
even
out
of
season
o
quite
possibly
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
this
is
right
up
there
with
schlafly
pumpkin
ms
treat
and
the
like
we
easily
polished
off
this
bomber
and
i
could
have
gone
for
me
great
stuff
overall
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
hands
down
enjoyed
on
draft
out
of
a
standard
glass
pint
the
great
pumpkin
pours
a
hazy
orange
and
gold
color
serious
pumpkin
pie
smell
like
youre
just
finished
thanksgiving
dinner
and
youre
diving
into
a
fresh
slice
of
homemade
pie
taste
is
similar
like
moms
pumpkin
pie
with
plenty
of
whipped
cream
a
smooth
and
delicious
brew
that
drinks
like
dessert
despite
the
high
alcohol
content
mouthfeel
is
sleek
with
a
bit
of
liquor
on
the
finish
if
you
swish
it
smoother
with
a
quick
swig
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
ever
sampled
and
one
i
could
go
back
to
overall
very
high
quality
o
best
pumpkin
beer
hands
down
o
christ
this
was
awesome
this
was
the
first
bottle
that
was
completely
drained
at
a
lineup
of
20odd
pumpkin
beers
and
for
good
reason
if
you
like
pumpkin
pie
seek
this
out
im
sorry
to
say
that
this
bumped
my
previous
favorite
kern
river
brewing
companys
pumpkin
ale
out
of
the
top
spot
at
the
tasting
while
krbcs
approach
is
very
sessionable
this
one
bumps
up
the
flavor
to
the
point
where
a
bomber
split
two
ways
is
perfect
o
this
is
probably
my
favorite
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
and
by
far
the
best
implementation
of
pumpkin
in
the
brewing
process
ive
tried
to
date
this
is
a
world
class
beer
and
deserves
gold
for
its
category
at
gabf
and
the
world
beer
cup
very
nicely
balanced
despite
the
high
alcohol
pretty
viscous
and
rich
without
being
heavy
highly
concentrated
medium
body
long
finish
really
a
great
beer
the
great
pumpkin
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
ghostly
white
head
intense
pumpkin
sugar
and
spice
on
the
nose
with
a
nice
bready
and
malty
backdrop
to
tame
the
spices
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
but
it
still
does
not
stand
up
to
pumking
which
until
further
notice
is
king
of
all
pumpkin
beers
thanks
eric
pours
a
copper
peach
with
a
fairly
large
head
nose
is
rich
pumpkin
pie
meat
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
pie
crust
awesome
rich
meaty
mouth
is
slick
and
kind
of
dark
spices
at
the
forefront
pumpkin
pie
meat
really
creeps
out
nothing
bright
or
vibrant
about
this
but
its
earthy
rich
and
super
enjoyable
im
going
to
have
to
drop
my
score
on
weyerbachers
which
was
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
before
this
how
come
all
the
pumpkin
beers
with
tremendous
flavor
and
not
a
ton
of
residual
sweetness
have
a
weak
aroma
subtle
caramel
vanilla
and
spice
on
the
nose
but
put
some
of
the
beer
in
your
mouth
and
the
aroma
kicks
in
hard
tons
of
flavor
reminds
me
of
schlafly
but
more
roasty
and
with
more
caramel
a
little
smoother
and
a
tad
sweeter
too
but
not
annoying
sweet
like
pumking
the
pumpkin
is
tasted
here
for
sure
cinnamon
ginger
clove
allspice
vanilla
caramel
full
mouthfeel
a
little
alcohol
tinge
on
the
finish
great
great
beer
wish
it
was
one
i
could
get
more
easily
if
i
put
this
against
2011
pumking
this
would
win
yet
2010
pumking
was
definitely
better
i
have
made
pumpkin
beers
before
and
know
it
is
definitely
not
easy
to
create
and
know
what
the
outcome
will
be
od
i
could
put
a
bomber
down
this
is
a
mighty
great
pumpkin
ale
from
elysian
arguably
the
king
o
yeah
smells
good
but
tastes
brutal
for
me
i
like
elysian
and
have
previously
enjoyed
this
beer
but
wow
not
impressed
alcohol
sharp
chemicals
bitter
this
is
not
good
overall
this
is
a
great
fall
beer
that
tastes
like
a
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
without
tasting
artificial
i
would
drink
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
solid
pumpkin
brew
and
is
more
complex
than
some
of
the
other
big
favorite
pumpkin
beers
out
there
price
is
a
bit
steep
but
that
doesnt
affect
my
judging
of
the
fluid
inside
very
solid
but
a
bit
light
for
what
i
think
an
imperial
should
be
nice
complex
and
balanced
beer
o
awesome
this
definitely
fights
for
pumking
for
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
so
far
a
must
try
except
that
seattle
only
got
30
cases
supposedly
now
all
i
want
is
the
glass
overall
aside
from
midnight
suns
oak
aged
imperial
chocolate
pumpkin
porter
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
its
slightly
better
than
night
owl
which
i
opened
next
to
it
but
i
couldnt
review
because
it
didnt
hold
up
night
owl
great
pumpkin
and
eventually
world
domination
elysian
is
the
master
of
this
style
overall
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
spices
and
pumpkin
are
prominent
but
not
overpowering
somehow
manages
to
not
be
cloying
throughout
the
entire
glass
9
majorly
disappointing
schlaflys
offering
wipes
the
floor
with
this
maybe
you
pretend
it
is
the
skull
of
your
vanquished
enemies
either
way
it
has
been
spiced
correctly
you
drink
to
victory
it
does
finish
a
little
sweet
the
only
drawback
to
an
otherwise
outstanding
beer
while
most
pumpkin
beers
focus
on
spices
and
end
up
tasting
like
cinnamon
or
allspice
dissolved
in
an
unhopped
ale
this
beer
tastes
like
pumpkin
a
lot
like
pumpkin
there
is
some
cinnamon
in
there
but
its
not
overpowering
restrained
this
is
actually
a
good
beer
overall
shocking
id
even
drink
this
again
pours
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
fairly
faint
but
tends
to
focus
on
actual
pumpkin
flavors
as
opposed
to
an
overload
of
spices
the
taste
confirms
this
as
there
is
some
nice
sweet
pumpkin
and
a
bit
of
malt
mild
spicing
in
the
background
feel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
drinks
really
well
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
awhile
now
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
next
review
overall
this
is
thee
best
pumpkin
beer
out
there
hand
down
as
i
drink
more
of
this
it
is
becoming
a
favorite
of
mine
for
sure
i
just
hope
i
can
get
this
each
year
because
it
is
on
my
list
as
a
seasonal
i
must
have
drinkability
is
pretty
good
your
average
pumpkin
brew
the
spices
bring
out
the
heat
even
though
its
not
really
that
strong
at
7
8
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
out
there
if
you
are
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
this
is
an
absolute
must
try
dont
be
fooled
by
the
relative
mediocrity
of
night
owl
bottles
though
its
ok
on
tap
the
great
pumpkin
is
definitely
where
elysians
holiday
spirit
shines
fantastic
beer
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
tasted
fantastic
stuff
not
a
great
beer
for
me
i
wish
it
would
have
tasted
more
like
it
smelled
because
the
pumpkin
didnt
really
come
through
much
overall
very
solid
indeed
going
by
the
nose
one
of
the
biggest
seasonal
i
have
yet
to
run
across
just
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
that
was
very
well
received
by
all
sample
at
alans
hsc
initation
bottle
from
elysian
in
seattle
this
beer
is
a
clear
copperorange
color
with
a
thin
light
beige
head
that
dissipates
steadily
rings
of
lacing
on

nice
pumpkin
pie
aroma
with
notes
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
mediumbodied
with
pumpkin
flavor
at
the
forefront
backed
up
by
sweet
malt
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
finish
is
spiced
pumpkin
goodness
that
lingers
awhile
very
enjoyable
overall
drinkability
a
splendid
finish
to
a
fine
evening
the
great
pumpkin
is
a
wonderful
pumpkin
ale
and
one
i
recommended
provided
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
d
maybe
my
most
anticipated
beer
and
i
was
beyond
pleased
very
drinkable
if
you
like
this
style
and
really
a
good
way
to
kick
start
the
best
month
of
the
year
d
pretty
high
but
it
does
get
to
be
a
bit
much
eventually
i
mean
you
can
only
have
so
much
pumpkin
pie
right
ok
the
aroma
is
a
lot
pumpkin
pie
brown
sugar
llightly
toasted
bread
spices
and
a
bit
of
orange
tastes
pretty
darn
close
to
pumpkin
pie
too
the
spice
hits
first
then
the
brown
sugar
comes
into
play
along
with
baked
pumpkin
representing
the
crust
of
a
pie
is
the
yeasty
breadiness
along
with
roasted
malt
this
is
quite
an
experience
however
as
it
warms
it
loses
its
spice
in
the
front
and
the
pumpkin
fades
within
the
yeast
and
malt
could
use
a
bit
more
kick
to
it
all
the
way
through
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
a
bit
slick
with
fairly
strong
carbonation

pours
a
crisp
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
the
aroma
is
a
huge
amount
of
pumpkin
spice
with
caramel
malts
right
behind
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
pumpkin
spice
is
more
predominate
than
in
many
other
pumpkin
ales
but
still
not
over
the
top
the
malts
tend
to
shine
through
more
in
the
finish
but
the
spices
linger
as
well
the
beer
is
fairly
light
and
crisp
with
decent
refreshing
carbonation
this
is
certainly
a
very
respectable
pumpkin
ale
one
i
would
try
again
if
given
the
opportunity
the
flavor
starts
off
bold
and
full
of
pumpkin
pie
notes
while
a
delicate
lactic
sweetness
quickly
gives
way
to
a
spicy
booze
onslaught
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
too
massive
as
tonguelashing
sweet
and
sour
spices
override
the
more
delicate
pumpkin
front
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
the
body
is
a
bit
thick
and
syrupy
to
be
a
sessionable
october
brew
especially
when
you
live
in
the
carolinas
however
this
was
certainly
an
interesting
craft
beer
experience
and
easily
the
greatest
pumpkin
ale
ive
tried
poured
a
nice
orangish
with
a
quickly
disappating
head
the
nose
was
pumpkin
and
spicey
taste
was
pumpkin
nutmeg
spices
and
cinnamon
the
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
give
it
an
extra
kick
and
zing
at
the
end
mouthfeel
was
exceptional
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
the
abv
seems
light
the
abv
and
pumpkin
taste
was
a
bit
more
prominent
on
tap
had
this
at
the
pumpkin
festival
at
the
elysian
in
capitol
hill
as
the
original
reviewer
noted
this
is
their
imperial
pumpkin
and
a
great
beer
it
is
probably
my
all
time
favorite
pumpkin
ale
and
it
is
bottled
too
abv
is
8
1
in
2007
and
the
beer
is
brewed
with
real
pumpkin
roasted
pumpkin
seeds
and
the
malts
are
pale
crystal
45
munich
carahell
and
carared
spiced
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
cloves
and
allspice
in
conditioning
and
bittered
with
magnum
hops
starting
gravity
18
5
degrees
plato
pours
a
dark
orangeamber
with
a
creamy
head
and
good
lacing
smells
rich
and
sweet
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
tastes
of
creamy
pumpkin
brown
sugar
spice
and
fresh
cream
rich
and
full
mouthfeel
with
a
creamy
finish
this
is
utterly
delicious
addendum
after
trying
a
carefully
saved
bottle
this
september
i
cannot
recommend
it
more
aged
almost
1
year
the
beer
was
fantastically
spicy
but
smooth
with
a
gloriously
velvety
mouthfeel
buy
a
few
bottles
this
year
and
stick
a
few
in
the
cellar
awesome
purchased
a
22
at
the
brewery
on
capitol
hill
and
served
it
in
a
pint
glass
at
home
appears
orangish
amber
and
a
little
cloudy
with
particulates
the
beer
poured
with
a
thick
ivory
head
and
smelled
of
green
apple
and
sugary
pear
directly
after
the
pour
melding
quickly
into
a
strong
fresh
pumpkin
pie
and
spice
cake
wow
smells
like
fall
mouthfeel
is
substantial
a
little
syrupy
and
good
for
the
style
the
taste
was
dominated
by
the
spices
of
pumpkin
pie
brown
sugar
nutmeg
cinnamon
cloves
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
comes
through
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
in
this
beer
toward
the
end
though
mostly
hidden
up
front
by
all
the
spice
and
caramelly
malt
a
strong
beer
but
it
is
still
drinkable
because
it
just
tastes
so
good
definately
an
excellent
fall
beer
but
one
that
will
overwhelm
your
tastebuds
after
a
few
another
great
seasonal
from
the
elysian
definitely
my
favorite
pumpkin
brew
to
date
i
have
never
been
overwhelmed
by
the
style
but
this
one
is
the
real
deal
this
is
the
elysian
brewerys
imperial
pumpkin
ale
yes
the
moniker
fits
because
this
is
a
brew
fit
for
royalty
i
seem
to
remember
the
abv
being
something
like
7
7
but
im
not
certain
anyway
the
body
is
is
like
autumn
hued
crystal
perfectly
transparent
yet
a
crisp
orange
color
head
is
a
dense
carpet
of
creamy
foam
oddly
you
cant
see
any
of
the
carbonation
but
you
can
feel
it
once
you
take
a
sip
nose
is
big
on
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
and
yes
of
course
pumpkin
flavors
are
much
the
same
but
this
is
certainly
the
beer
that
has
done
the
best
job
of
blending
them
pumpkin
is
thankfully
big
on
the
finish
id
honestly
say
that
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
previously
it
was
elysians
other
pumpkin
ale
night
owl
also
despite
the
abv
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
probably
would
work
like
a
charm
as
a
dessert
beer
this
should
become
a
very
sought
after
beer
im
already
hoping
they
brew
it
again
next
year
totally
cinnamon
in
the
nose
and
mouth
dark
brown
with
a
modest
head
left
most
of
a
12
oz
glass
on
the
bar
on
tap
at
elysian
fields
from
notes
at
april
2014
visit
smell
is
amazing
great
beer
elysian
definitely
nails
their
pumpkin
beers
the
pumpkin
is
spot
on
but
the
cinnamon
is
a
little
too
dominant
to
give
higher
marks
overall
very
good
beer
keeps
a
nice
balance
between
stout
characteristics
and
pumpkin
way
too
much
cinnamon
never
been
disappointed
by
elysian
really
dark
pumpkin
stout
loved
it
poured
smooth
and
well
balanced
between
the
stout
and
pumpkin
overall
i
really
liked
it
but
my
expectations
from
the
fantastic
pour
and
aroma
were
somewhat
tempered
by
a
flavour
profile
full
of
positive
components
that
just
doesnt
quite
add
up
to
the
sum
of
its
parts
an
excellent
pumpkin
ale
and
a
darned
good
stout
in
its
own
right
interesting
label
art
depicting
a
werecat
or
werewolf
a
cinnamon
bomb
really
good
though
basically
too
much
cinamon
powder
considering
this
as
a
slightly
unusual
stout
i
really
like
this
its
a
much
better
beer
than
most
of
the
pumpkin
ales
out
there
it
doesnt
fit
a
pure
style
niche
but
more
power
to
dick
cantwell
for
his
originality
pours
a
handsome
pitch
black
with
a
mocha
or
chocolate
colored
head
of
creamy
foam
that
lasts
and
adorns
the
glass
the
nose
is
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
a
faint
bit
of
allspice
and
a
light
fragrant
ginger
to
really
perk
up
the
nose
the
malt
on
the
nose
is
roasty
but
biscuity
too
creamy
and
smooth
smelling
even
on
the
nose
there
is
a
faint
bit
of
light
chocolate
and
that
is
a
surprise
pumpkin
scent
is
hard
to
find
but
its
there
taste
is
heavy
with
cinnamon
the
body
is
creamy
adn
the
malt
is
impeccable
the
roast
is
deep
and
flows
freely
at
the
back
palate
there
is
a
slight
bitter
from
that
roast
that
is
so
lovely
the
spices
are
all
there
but
i
wish
i
could
taste
more
pumpkin
cinnamon
allspice
nutmeg
clove
and
ginger
the
chocolate
flavor
seems
to
smooth
out
this
beer
without
really
taking
center
stage
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
silken
there
should
not
be
any
alcohol
on
this
palate
at
only
6
5
percent
but
there
is
a
twinge
of
it
in
the
finish
there
is
a
slight
hop
bitterness
that
takes
the
tongue
for
a
brief
moment
before
this
one
finishes
dry
and
with
that
lovely
dry
pie
crust
to
linger
and
that
very
dominant
cinnamon
this
beer
is
nasty
i
could
drink
only
a
few
sips
of
it
way
too
cinnamony
and
bitter
and
just
ugh
very
disappointing
o
i
would
call
this
a
cinnamon
stout
and
nothing
else
the
cinnamon
was
far
too
strong
for
my
taste
but
as
the
beer
warmed
it
actually
smoothed
out
both
in
aroma
and
taste
then
again
my
taste
buds
could
have
been
slowly
dying
bonus
tip
pairs
quite
well
with
oreos
not
my
favorite
beer
but
glad
i
tried
it
im
very
much
looking
forward
to
punkuccino
tomorrow
which
i
think
will
be
more
up
my
alley
3
55
overall
so
how
does
this
stack
up
against
the
other
elysian
pumkpin
beers
except
for
owl
which
i
have
not
yet
tried
i
was
disappointed
by
the
great
pumpkin
which
i
thought
was
too
bitter
boozy
and
had
an
artificial
and
chemicallike
flavor
to
it
dark
o
is
smooth
and
natural
the
characteristics
are
different
from
punkuccino
but
i
feel
this
beer
is
equally
as
strong
for
its
own
reasons
both
noses
are
highly
spicy
dark
o
provides
a
burst
of
cinnamon
while
punku
has
a
broader
fall
spice
profile
including
nutmeg
allspice
and
of
course
coffee
this
is
a
great
stout
with
warming
characteristics
brought
out
by
the
up
front
notes
of
cinnamon
one
of
the
more
unique
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
that
manages
to
balance
spice
nicely
with
a
solid
stout
base
rich
aroma
and
complex
taste
accented
by
pumpkin
its
balanced
and
enjoyable
but
the
thin
feel
is
slightly
distracting
great
stout
cinnamon
hits
you
up
front
but
it
is
never
overpowering
or
offputting
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
throughout
subtle
notes
of
pumpkin
on
the
finish
it
is
like
drinking
coffee
chocolate
french
toast
probably
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
out
there
pours
a
black
color
32
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
slight
all
spice
slight
ginger
and
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
pumpkin
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
ginger
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
and
hint
of
hop
overall
great
appearance
good
aroma
body
and
blend
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
goblet
glass
it
has
a
black
as
night
body
with
no
head
to
it
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
pumpkin
and
a
hint
of
cinnamon
the
taste
has
a
roasty
chocolaty
taste
up
front
then
a
little
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
come
in
near
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
overall
a
really
good
version
of
a
pumpkin
and
stout
this
is
superb
elysian
does
pumpkin
better
than
any
brewery
ive
come
across
this
has
a
rich
thick
head
sitting
on
a
clear
but
opaquely
dark
brown
liquid
lots
of
lace
and
good
retention
superior
aromatics
bring
copious
amounts
of
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
as
a
thick
slice
of
pie
topped
with
cinnamon
the
taste
is
much
the
same
its
like
drinking
pie
and
mocha
together
the
finish
brings
a
graham
cracker
crust
and
earthy
hop
bitterness
that
evokes
a
rich
cup
of
coffee
not
an
sweet
beer
overall
and
highly
sessionable
feel
is
perfectly
weighted
with
a
light
supple
caressing
of
the
mouth
and
tongue
smoothly
carbonated
with
just
enough
liveliness
this
drinks
like
a
dry
irish
stout
great
beer
and
one
to
seek
out
often
while
elysian
hasnt
impressed
me
much
in
the
past
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
deep
and
dark
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
with
little
to
no
head
smells
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
some
smokey
malts
flavor
is
great
a
smooth
balance
of
pumpkin
baking
spice
and
a
lingering
smokiness
form
the
patent
malt
the
flavors
pass
back
and
forth
playing
a
perfect
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
smooth
and
slick
but
not
oily
o
a
decent
beer
overall
a
bit
simplistic
but
enjoyable
total
4250
love
at
first

absolute
explosion
of
sweet

savory
spice
and

ive
tried
a
lot
of
different
pumpkin
beers
this
season
and
several
others
from
elysian
and
this
is
the
one
i
was
looking
for
the
feel
is
thick
without
being
syrupy
the
carbonation
is
pleasing
and
the
color
is
a
deep
dark
autumnal
redbrown
after
the
first
few
sips
the
malt
and
cinnamon
dominate
the
palette
until
the
beer
warms
up
and
the
pumpkin
shines
through
once
more
great
ride
and
a

can
throw
down
with

o
out
of
all
the
recommendations
for
this
beer
i
cant
believe
i
never
heard
anyone
remark
on
the
cinnamon
bomb
this
beer
is
i
barely
finished
my
half
of
the
bottle
and
my
wife
had
to
drain
pour
hers
the
amount
of
cinnamon
is
just
rediculous
odelicious
stout
with
great
balance
of
flavors
poured

cinnamon
hits
the

smooth

i
wish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
more
full
overall
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
for
the
last
month
and
am
glad
i
nabbed
a
bottle
i
thought
maaybe
my
palate
would
have
changed
from
last
year
but
if
anything
else
thijs
years
batch
was
even
better
than
memory
served
was
really
excited
to
find
this
one
in
co
since
ive
been
wanting
to
try
it
for
a
while
and
figured
itd
never
show
up
down
here
label
is
awesome
but
at
6something
abv
dont
expect
to
be
turning
into
a
werewolf
after
drinking
it
or
anything
just
a
nice
warming
stout
pours
black
with
a
cocoa
colored
head
and
looks
quite
tantalizing
nose
gives
off
a
lot
of
cinnamon
and
cocoa
taste
is
really
smoky
wife
said
it
was
like
drinking
a
cigar
and
i
said
it
was
like
licking
an
ash
tray
other
than
that
you
get
cinnamon
and
if
the
pumpkin
is
in
there
anywhere
which
im
sure
it
is
it
really
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
spice
and
smoke
which
is
just
all
up
in
your
palate
overall
i
actually
liked
it
as
a
seasonal
stout
and
found
the
flavor
really
intriguing
but
would
probably
opt
for
some
night
owl
or
great
pumpkin
in
place
of
this
one
if
looking
for
a
pumpkin
beer
also
didnt
think
this
warranted
the
ten
dollar
price
tag
but
still
glad
i
got
to
try
it
had
this
on
tap
before
and
having
it
on
bottle
now
i
know
this
doesnt
age
well
it
is
a
great
beer
when
its
first
released
and
am
basing
the
stats
on
that
treat
is
still
way
better
for
this
style
even
when
dotm
is
at
its
peak
o
overall
is
manages
to
present
the
squash
smell
and
flavour
exceptionally
well
and
pairs
that
sweet
and
musky
earthiness
with
toasted
scents
and
flavours
a
fuller
mouth
feel
would
enhance
the
experience
however
still
and
great
beer
mid
year
to
remind
me
of
halloweens
past
overall
this
is
only
the
second
pumpkin
stout
i
have
ever
had
and
the
experience
has
been
quite
pleasing
i
prefer
this
to
the
fishermans
pumpkin
stout
i
am
excited
to
try
other
elysian
pumpkin
ales
as
well
because
they
seem
to
fall
nicely
in
between
brewers
who
may
be
too
extreme
with
the
pumpkin
aspect
and
those
who
barely
make
it
detectable
in
the
beer
o
decent
pumpkin
stout
but
not
in
the
same
class
as
pumpkinator
or
treat
nice
pumpkin
ale
sure
did
roll
through
the
elysian
pumpkin
lineup
this
year
this
one
was
good
overall
a
great
stout
w
nice
spice
additions
that
dont
go
overboard
and
yet
still
add
to
the
finished
product
o
what
a
great
pumpkin
beer
i
think
pumpkin
along
with
all
its
associated
spices
add
a
lot
to
ale
feelin
it
o
overall
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
stout
i
enjoyed
it
however
i
prefer
treat
over
this
by
a
high
degree
worth
a
try
certainly
a
unique
twist
on
the
style
but
fairly
well
done
generous
flavor
and
aroma
character
that
really
blends
well
o
surprisingly
good
stuff
my
expectations
were
low
but
this
one
surprised
me
it
drinks
more
like
a
pumpkin
porter
than
a
stout
i
think
but
its
good
the
spices
dont
overwhelm
the
beer
here
at
all
but
provide
some
nice
additional
flavor
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
i
split
the
bomber
with
a
friend
but
i
could
have
easily
drank
the
bomber
and
enjoyed
it
othis
was
a
decent
tasting
stout
but
i
was
a
little
let
down
by
the
absence
of
pumpkin
i
have
been
sitting
on
this
for
about
2
months
so
freshness
might
be
an
issue
but
i
still
expected
more
pumpkin
nevertheless
this
was
pleasantly
flavored
and
drinkable
o
i
definitely
like
the
combination
between
the
pumpkin
beer
character
and
the
chocolate
i
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
out
of
the
pumpkin
beer
series
pours
jet
black
with
a
brown
head
in
the
aroma
roasty
earthy
and
some
spices
in
there
in
the
taste
roasty
coffee
earth
and
a
small
mixed
bag
of
spices
a
smooth
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
roast
and
earthy
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
earthy
roasty
and
a
small
spice
interesting
flavors
and
style
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
and
definitely
the
best
one
incorporating
roasted
malt
i
like
it
even
more
than
the
great
pumpkin
o
could
have
passed
for
a
porter
actually
a
fun
example
of
the
more
extremem
ends
of
the
style
but
unfortunately
the
subtle
flavors
were
washed
out
still
enjoyable
to
try
overall
pumpkin
beers
arent
for
everyone
but
this
beer
shows
admirable
restraint
and
balance
i
think
the
base
of
a
dark
stout
does
a
good
job
in
holding
up
to
the
spicing
and
pumpkin
ill
have
this
again
next
year
at
least
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
pumpkin
ale
so
i
guess
that
put
my
expectations
too
high
in
them
using
the
same
practice
for
a
stout
nothing
worth
dropping
a
10
spot
on
pity
since
a
six
pack
of
pumpkin
would
have
only
ran
me
a
few
dollars
more
a
solid
take
on
the
style
a
bit
over
on
the
bitter
chocolate
but
a
nice
blend
overall
in
the
last
few
weeks
ive
had
a
number
of
pumpkin
beers
from
elysian
they
have
all
been
good
dark
o
the
moon
is
no
exception
its
a
tasty
balanced
pumpkin
stout
its
not
really
exciting
but
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpking
beers
this
wasnt
bad
i
might
even
order
it
again
under
the
right
circumstances
pours
black
with
a
chocolaty
espresso
head
on
it
burnt
chocolate
malts
with
a
touch
of
pumpkin
hit
the
nose
from
the
glass
the
taste
is
on
par
with
the
aromas
chocolate
malts
open
this
up
these
take
on
a
more
roastedcoffee
character
and
dont
deviate
from
these
two
flavors
the
spices
it
was
claimed
to
be
brewed
with
never
show
up
on
the
palate
the
body
is
medium
and
smooth
overall
this
is
a
straight
up
stout
i
gave
it
marks
for
being
a
delicious
stout
but
it
missed
the
whole
pumpkin
experience
it
was
trying
to
deliver
cheers
lampertland
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
cream
coloredhead
that
froths
nicely
and
lingers
reasonably
well
good
webbing
on
the
glass
walls
smell
is
high
on
malts
and
some
faint
spice
taste
reveals
a
nice
balance
with
pumpkin
spices
like
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
but
not
over
powering
i
appreciate
the
different
spin
on
a
traditional
pumpkin
beer
but
delivered
with
a
solid
stout
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
not
for
the
reasons
that
i
thought
i
would
yes
it
was
a
thick
stout
with
a
creamy
chocolate
flavour
and
smooth
malty
finish
but
what
really
jumped
out
at
me
was
the
pumpkin
flavour
this
wasnt
some
tame
or
demure
pumpkin
pie
overtone
this
was
a
smash
of
fresh
pumpkin
with
a
sprinkling
of
vibrant
cinnamon
im
rarely
impressed
by
pumpkin
flavour
i
tend
to
judge
the
pumpkin
beers
more
harshly
than
others
im
pretty
picky
when
it
comes
down
to
the
balance
of
spices
and
the
texture
of
the
pumpkin
the
reason
this
one
stood
out
to
me
was
the
freshness
the
flavour
seemed
to
jump
out
of
the
glass
as
if
it
had
just
been
brewed
this
morning
and
i
dont
mean
it
was
raw
or
harsh
it
was
still
smooth
and
creamy
but
with
a
liveliness
that
was
new
to
me
i
will
definitely
be
going
back
for
another
bottle
of
this
for
halloween
night
overall
this
is
a
nice
stout
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
additional
spiced
components
keep
it
interesting
through
the
bomber
bottle
you
dont
see
a
ton
of
dark
pumpkin
beers
and
this
is
a
winner
pours
very
dense
black
almost
no
light
coming
through
at
all
and
a
quickly
dying
khaki
head
the
nose
is
a
perfect
blend
of
milk
chocolate
vanilla
and
cinnamon
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
seed
flavor
are
up
front
squashy
and
a
little
bitter
from
the
dark
malts
cocoa
and
spice
finish
it
out
the
abv
is
perfect
for
this
beer
its
one
you
could
drink
several
of
but
sturdy
enough
to
keep
ya
going
feel
is
fullest
of
bodies
and
spirited
carbonation
for
the
style
i
like
the
effort
here
a
very
different
beer
perfect
for
the
night
of
the
first
snowfall
leaves
all
frost
covered
half
on
the
trees
half
on
the
ground
its
just
right
served
in
a
tulip
glass
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
small
tan
head
that
retained
well
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
dark
roasty
malts
were
the
dominant
factor
in
the
nose
with
lesser
notes
of
roasted
pumpkin
and
light
spice
and
charcoal
the
roast
again
took
command
in
the
taste
with
any
pumpkin
being
very
subtle
dark
malts
coffee
molasses
charcoal
mellow
autumn
spices
about
medium
bodied
perhaps
too
thin
for
a
normal
stout
but
it
actually
worked
well
with
this
beer
not
bad
overall
a
nice
stout
nothing
earth
shattering
good
flavors
for
a
6
5abv
stout
though
the
feel
is
a
tad
thin
would
like
to
see
more
pumpkin
spice
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
no
traces
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
it
seems
to
be
a
good
blend
of
two
styles
pumpkin
ale
and
stout
full
bodied
with
a
deeply
roasted
presence
that
overpowers
the
subtle
pumpkin
presence
this
is
nicely
complimented
by
the
zesty
spice
notes
but
its
slightly
acrid
and
in
desperate
need
of
some
sweetness
very
dry
to
the
point
of
almost
tasting
burnt
with
charred
dark
malt
flavors
toast
and
espresso
bean
along
with
cinnamon
clove
allspice
and
pepper
very
onedimensional
with
hardly
any
pumpkin
flavor
to
speak
of
i
would
have
never
guessed
that
there
was
any
in
there
it
just
tastes
like
a
spicy
overly
roasted
stout
no
alcohol
hear
to
speak
of
but
the
harsh
burnt
malt
and
dry
spice
make
it
somewhat
tough
to
drink
d
unpretentious
this
one
is
a
stout
first
and
a
pumpkin
seasonal
second
thats
not
a
bad
thing
but
rather
just
a
statement
of
fact
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
that
i
would
drink
with
regularity
o
i
really
enjoy
the
pumpkin
stout
hybrid
style
for
some
reason
these
really
work
for
me
almost
like
if
you
combined
chocolate
and
pumpkin
pie
kind
of
like
a
derby
pie
it
drinks
much
easier
than
the
6
5
abv
that
it
is
especially
since
the
mouthfeel
is
also
lighter
very
enjoyable
glad
i
bought
the
pumpkin
patch
sampler
pack
to
get
this
one
overall
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
stout
but
not
a
good
as
fishermans
friend
pumpkin
stout
by
cape
ann
brewing
nice
not
must
try
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
an
interesting
take
on
the
pumpkin
beer
the
roastiness
of
the
stout
melds
very
well
with
the
traditional
pumpkin
ale
spices
a
pretty
decent
and
tasty
stout
the
pumpkin
adds
a
unique
touch
but
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
of
it
if
it
had
just
a
bit
more
pumpkin
it
would
be
truly
spectacular
pours
a
dark
chalky
brown
to
near
black
good
head
and
retention
decent
lacing
scent
is
roast
with
hints
of
char
cinnamon
bark
and
milkstout
like
sweetness
taste
although
lacking
in
much
seasonal
flavor
does
combine
roast
and
spice
nicely
light
lingering
malt
sweetness
medium
bodied
creamy
with
a
hint
of
chalkyness
solid
but
not
spectacular
overall
i
am
glad
that
this
was
my
first
try
at
elysian
i
look
forward
to
drinking
the
immortal
ipa
which
is
currently
in
my
cellar
meh
didnt
really
think
it
worked
the
pumpkin
edge
was
dull
overall
overall
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
stout
i
appreciate
the
lower
abv
because
i
feel
it
helps
the
spice
and
pumpkin
flavors
to
emerge
more
too
much
malt
would
mask
the
sometimes
subtle
flavor
of
pumpkin
this
is
a
great
cool
weather
fall
evening
beer
and
would
gladly
consume
it
regularly
if
it
was
readily
accessable
to
me
o
i
was
happy
to
see
this
sitting
on
the
shelf
right
next
to
the
great
pumpkin
it
would
be
a
very
good
stout
in
its
own
right
but
it
stands
out
above
the
rest
in
the
pumpkin
beer
category
perfect
for
anyone
who
wants
solid
pumpkin
flavors
without
the
cloying
sweetness
that
come
with
most
of
them
not
my
favorite
under
any
stretch
but
there
arent
too
many
pumpkin
porters
that
make
to
bottles
out
here
im
glad
this
one
does
even
if
there
are
others
like
i
more
for
a
6
5
stout
this
had
some
pretty
huge
flavors
going
on
really
nice
as
a
stout
this
beer
is
the
right
color
and
has
a
relatively
heavy
mouthfeel
but
otherwise
it
doesnt
hit
any
of
the
right
notes
though
only
hopped
to
20
ibus
theres
a
surplus
of
bitterness
from
the
other
ingredients
it
got
the
bitterness
levels
of
a
russian
imperial
stout
but
doesnt
have
nearly
the
grain
bill
that
that
style
requires
pumpkin
beers
are
a
challenging
style
but
they
can
be
executed
well
bring

very
nice
this
and
the
great
pumpkin
are
must
have
annual
beers
for
me
in
the
fall
overall
this
was
a
cool
brew
i
felt
that
the
base
beer
is
a
stout
or
porter
wishing
for
more
pumpkin
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
large
tan
head
the
aroma
has
a
ton
of
cinnamon
in
it
as
well
as
some
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
allspice
the
flavor
also
has
a
lot
of
spices
in
it
i
get
some
cinnamon
clove
allspice
and
nutmeg
as
well
as
some
pumpkin
and
quite
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
and
an
average
stout
not
sure
ill
be
looking
for
this
again
next
year
though
o
overall
easily
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
stouts
ive
had
really
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
in
general
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
o
glad
i
tried
it
worth
a
try
but
nothing
to
trade
for
imo
a
little
sweet
otherwise
a
very
great
brew
very
drinkable
and
good
for
the
winter
season
o
probably
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
of
the
year
a
bit
overpriced
but
worth
a
try
o
has
that
elysian
texture
and
blend
not
bold
or
aggressive
but
not
underwhelming
this
years
version
was
much
better
than
last
a
bit
more
complex
and
rich
o
the
great
pumpkin
and
night
owl
were
so
much
better
than
this
i
was
disappointed
i
really
thought
we
had
a
trifecta
of
winners
here
o
nice
pumpkin
stout
low
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
chalky
and
thick
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
nothing
too
exciting
though
overall
solid
stuff
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tasted
and
a
proper
stout
to
boot
worth
a
taste
if
you
come
across
it
even
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
pumpkin
definitely
enjoyed
this
brew
improved
as
it
warmed
looking
forward
to
trying
a
heavier
stout
with
pumpkin
but
i
really
enjoy
this
take
on
a
pumpkin
brew
easy
drinking
moderate
body
low
carbonation
all
in
all
a
game
changer
for
me
didnt
think
much
of
pumpkin
beers
until
i
tried
this
one
overall
a
nice
smooth
stout
with
a
nice
twist
perfect
for
a
cold
october
night
o
well
this
is
a
beer
with
cinnamon
not
a
pumpkin
stout
although
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
a
stout
not
a
pumpkin
beer
my
initial
reaction
at
the
pour
was
not
so
good
as
i
poured
it
heavily
into
a
glass
with
little
to
no
head
or
glorious
mocha
foam
like
i
was
expecting
but
with
a
good
smell
and
an
even
better
taste
the
beer
still
holds
high
marks
i
dont
know
about
being
worth
the
9
but
it
would
be
one
to
buy
a
lot
of
if
it
were
fairly
priced
overall
i
love
this
beer
very
subtle
and
doesnt
club
you
over
the
head
with
pumpkin
more
of
a
stout
that
has
some
pumpkin
flavor
then
a
pumpkin
ale
excellent
seasonal
by
elysian
o
was
kind
of
put
off
by
the
thought
of
pumpkin
in
my
stout
but
this
is
well
done
i
really
like
it
wish
it
was
a
lot
thicker
but
hey
nobody
makes
a
perfect
beer
thanks

and

with

finish
getting
through
a

of
this
is
a
chore
perhaps
this
tastes
better
when
the
pumpkin
flavoring
is
fresher
but
wear
doesnt
really
seem
to
be
the
problem
theres
just
too
much
cinnamon
if
that
were
dialed
down
a
little
maybe
this
would
be
a
bit
more
palateable
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
and
well
done
beer
once
the
flavor
combination
grows
on
you
it
becomes
very
drinkable
i
am
going
to
seek
this
one
out
again
d
this
was
shockingly
gourd
easily
the
best

all
these

of
pumpkin

beers
mouthfeel
is

and

very

d
cant

ones
with

kind
of
appeal
to
my
taste
buds
alaskan
smoked

comes
to

though
dotm
isnt
at

asp
level
for
me
it
has
really
good
flavor
and
a
beautiful
feel
in
a
very
attractive
brew
elysian
packs
plenty
besides
pumpkin
and
stout
into
this
pumpkin
stout
a
seasonal
thats
definitely
worth
hunting
down
ill
be
on
the
prowl
next
year
thanks
for
the
bottle
jon
overall
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
stab
at
a
pumpkin
stout
if
you
like
this
beer
definitely
try
and
get
your
hands
on
midnight
suns
imperial
chocolate
pumpkin
porter
now
called
treat
it
is
a
similar
beer
but
much
more
balanced
and
perfected
that
being
said
i
dont
want
to
take
anything
away
from
this
brew
as
its
an
ok
shot
at
a
dark
pumpkin
beer
just
needs
a
little
work
around
the
edges
id
say
poured
a
deep
black
with
a
small
short
lived
tan
head
the
aroma
was
overwhelming
chocolate
and
heavy
malts
the
taste
is
pretty
good
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
and
consists
of
cinammon
this
changes
to
a
deep
chocolate
and
heavy
malt
taste
carbonation
was
medium
and
the
beer
laced
the
entire
glass
a
very
good
adaptation
to
the
pumpkin
beers
that
i
am
used
to
a
bit
thin
but
a
decent
stout
thanks
poured
a
black
color
with
good
carbonation
and
a
brown
head
nose
is
faint
chocolate
roasted
malt
espresso
but
really
no
pumpkin
cinnamon
or
spice
taste
is
creamy
bitter
chocolate
coffee
some
cinnamon
and
very
faint
pumpkin
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
bitter
chcolate
and
creamy
while
i
love
elysian
i
was
looking
for
more
pumpkin
in
this
pumpkin
stout
next
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
overall
this
was
different
and
definitely
unique
i
would
have
no
trouble
going
there
again
and
think
they
have
done
a
really
nice
thing
with
this
one
drinkability
is
pretty
good
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
going
festive
but
dont
like
the
usually
insipid
thin
spice
bombs
that
call
themselves
pumkin
ales
then
this
is
a
decent
choice
the
flavor
also
has
a
substantial
amount
of
chocolate
to
it
and
the
pumpkin
is
again
subtle
a
little
cinnamon
is
evident
and
i
detect
some
spicy
character
on
my
tongue
but
i
cant
pinpoint
what
that
is
a
touch
of
coffee
is
noticeable
but
its
pretty
negligible
the
finish
is
rich
chocolate
with
moderate
pumpkin
notes
and
a
subtle
roast
i
like
elysians
approach
to
a
pumpkin
beer
with
dark
o
the
moon
the
beer
isnt
flashy
overly
flavored
like
a
lot
of
pumpkin
beers
or
bal
aged
but
i
think
its
well
crafted
the
combination
of
chocolate
and
pumpkin
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
the
beer
is
light
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
this
is
odd
because
as
a
stout
i
think
its
a
fantastic
beer
as
a
pumpkin
beer
i
cant
recommend
it
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
one
however
i
cant
deny
the
complexity
and
just
overall
great
quality
of
such
a
stout
that
i
could
drink
all
night
d
very
drinkable
and
complex
this
is
definitely
blurring
the
style
lines
cheers
overall
a
tasty
pumpkin
stout
d
overall
this
beer
is
very
tasty
from
the
bottle
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
if
i
was
blessed
with
more
then
one
bottle
that
i
probably
wont
get
again
till
next
year
i
am
gonna
see
if
i
can
some
of
this
at
the
great
pumpkin
beer
fest
they
will
be
throwing
soon
if
you
see
this
in
your
local
store
buy
it
because
it
is
worth
trying
if
you
can
get
more
then
one
bottle
do
it
because
it
wont
last
long
until
next
year

never
mind
the
pumpkin
aspects
of
this
i
thought
that
this
worked
worderfully
just
as
a
plain
ole
full
flavored
stout
the
pumpkin
spices
were
just
an
added
and
luckily
not
overdone
aspect
that
lent
some
warmth
and
falllike
qualities
to
the
mix
good
stuff
here
that
im
quite
glad
to
have
tried
was
lucky
enough
to
try
this
from
their
pumpkin
event
earlier
in
the
week
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brownblack
with
a
nice
head
the
pumpkin
spices
aroma
is
not
very
strong
compared
to
other
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
more
on
the
stout
side
with
roasted
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
and
cloves
the
taste
is
much
more
of
a
robust
stout
than
a
pumpkin
beer
the
pumpkin
spices
try
to
come
out
a
little
but
seem
to
fade
quickly
overall
this
beer
gets
point
for
not
being
an
overdone
spiced
pumpkin
beer
like
some
are
and
for
brewing
outside
the
box
and
making
a
stout
version
of
a
pumpkin
beer
pours
almost
black
with
a
thin
head
and
some
lacing
aside
from
the
roasted
grain
in
the
nose
you
can
really
smell
the
cinnamon
and
roasted
pumpkin
seeds
the
taste
has
a
more
pronounced
pumpkin
flavor
and
sweetness
the
cinnamon
is
also
evident
here
as
is
a
late
nutty
roastiness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
dry
once
again
a
very
interesting
pumpkin
brew
from
this
brewery
and
another
one
that
works
dark
o
the
moon
is
a
strong
pumpkin
stout
although
i
classified
it
as
a
pumpkin
ale
it
is
actually
more
of
a
robust
strong
stout
brewed
with
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
spices
the
pumpkin
spices
are
not
overly
strong
and
shine
through
more
in
the
background
of
the
beer
creating
a
nice
twist
in
this
delicious
stout
the
elysian
seems
to
shine
with
its
pumpkin
style
brews
so
i
thought
id
better
try
this
one
before
it
is
gone
for
good
looked
black
as
most
stouts
with
aromas
of
coffee
cocoa
some
cinnamon
and
cloves
the
taste
was
roasty
and
deep
with
dark
chocolate
and
cloves
followed
by
sour
dark
cherries
and
nutmeg
and
finishing
with
ripe
pumpkin
meat
a
very
interesting
concept
for
a
beer
and
an
excellent
fusion
of
a
pumpkin
ale
and
a
strong
stout
surprised
i
havent
seen
a
pumpkin
stout
before
now
try
it
on
tap
before
its
gone
i
was
informed
they
probably
wont
be
bottling
it
taste
like
a
fresh
pumpkin
when
your
a
kid
carving
a
jackolantern
great
pumpkin
flavor
really
satisfying
overall
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
with
a
great
balance
of
sweetness
and
spice
my
absolute
favorite
fall
beer
the
best
pumpkin
beer
you
will
find
o
very
well
balanced
pumpkin
ale
that
showcases
the
pumpkin
itself
rather
than
the
spicing
like
most
pumpkin
ales
overall
a
tasty
enjoyable
spiceforward
pumpkin
beer
solid
pumpkin
ale
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
last
year
but
it
tastes
a
little
thin
this
time
around
better
than
most
but
not
amongst
the
best
overall
this
is
a
great
chai
with
some
booze
but
an
okay
beer
that
feels
like
a
pumpkin
chai
this
is
a
pumpkin
beer
you
can
drink
a
few
of
and
still
enjoy
some
spice
notes
on
the
front
decent
balace
with
smooth
not
to
sweet
pumpkin
fattyness
o
a
remarkably
good
take
with
the
intensity
of
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
wellcrafted
and
worth
buying
i
was
less
impressed
with
this
than
i
should
be
by
the
ratings
but
i
did
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
id
put
it
toward
the
top
of
my
pumpkin
beer
selection
but
i
will
need
to
try
it
a
few
more
times
to
judge
it
better
pours
an
orangish
amber
with
a
white
head
and
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
inviting
and
has
big
notes
of
pumpkin
fruit
spice
and
hops
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
with
fruity
notes
and
pumpkin
vanilla
caramel
cream
and
subtle
cinnamon
like
spice
full
bodied
ale
with
ample
carbonation
overall
an
above
average
pumpkin
ale
this
is
not
a
beer
for
those
who
dont
like
pumpkin
ales
this
is
not
a
beer
for
those
who
really
want
a
stout
or
a
coffee
ale
or
something
else
this
is
a
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
pumpkin
flavor
in
a
well
made
ale
and
its
a
terrific
bargain
this
is
the
right
amount
of
pumpkin
flavor
and
smell
in
a
beer
reminiscent
of
pumpkin
pie
in
the
flavor
this
kicks
ass
alright
even
though
im
not
a
sweeter
her
guy
this
is
a
good
darker
ale
pallet
conquering
sweet
yet
not
over
powering
in
that
aspect
the
ice
cold
transcendence
towards
the
warmer
end
of
a
22oz
is
my
favorite
part
of
the
beer
much
like
a
heavy
german
beer
the
flavor
changes
by
the
minute
from
almost
a
fruitycitrusy
hef
to
a
thick
pumpkin
ale
beautiful
transition
o
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
pumpkin
beer
i
put
it
right
up
there
behind
pumking
along
with
schafly
pumpkin
ale
great
flavor
great
aroma
upon
further
review
i
find
that
i
graded
great
pumpkin
same
brewer
at
a
whopping
three
hundredths
higher
in
my
review
from
about
a
year
ago
so
i
bumped
this
one
up
03
great
flavor
wonderful
soices
overall
wow
thats
some
good
tasting
pumpkin
pie
beer
i
wasnt
sure
if
i
needed
to
grab
a
glass
or
a
fork
for
this
one
excellent
pumpkin
and
spice
flavours
that
dont
compete
with
one
another
definitely
pick
up
a
bottle
if
you
see
it
your
way
o
a
straightforward
but
wellexecuted
pumpkin
ale
this
is
your
everyday
pumpkin
ale
full
of
all
the
flavor
you
want
but
its
not
so
strong
that
it
becomes
overwhelming
no
off
flavors
and
fairly
clean
finish
with
just
a
bit
of
light
fuzziness
lingering
making
this
one
of
the
few
pumpkin
beers
out
there
you
could
drink
a
few
of
and
not
be
sick
of
pumpkin
think
pumpkin
pie
on
a
cold
fall
night
fullbodied
smooth
goodness
this
is
an
awesome
pumpkin
beer
very
pumpkiny
and
spicy
but
not
overwhelming
also
not
too
bitter
also
its
from
seattle
which
is
cool
because
seattle
is
awesome
also
its
available
in
12oz
bottles
so
you
dont
necessarily
need
to
drink
a
massive
pintsized
beer
also
the
label
is
pretty
tight
highly
recommend
it
pours
nicely
the
slight
cooper
tone
of
the
head
bode
well
of
the
very
nice
warm
spice
blend
the
taste
was
just
ok
by
me
not
as
dry
or
hoppy
as
this
years
2014
so
tier
effort
but
still

pumpkin

now
the

bottle
just
the
right
amount
of
pumpkin
flavor
without
overpowering
it
this
is
my
goto

pours
a
cloudy

aroma
of
wet
pumpkin
plus
pumpkin

taste
is
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
no
pumpkin
beer
ive
tried
before
tasted
this
much
like
pumpkin
pie
very
nice
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
available
on
the
first
taste
my
only
thought
was
this
actually
tastes
like
pumpkin
i
may
just
be
used
to
terrible
pumpkin
beers
but
this
is
absolutely
fantastic
which
is
par
for
the
course
for
elysian
o
great
pumpkin
beer
a
top
3
pumpkin
for
me

85
its
not
your
fault
i
generally
dislike
this
style
elysian
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
beers
i
have
tried
this
year
it
has
a
very
ripe
pumpkin
aroma
with
softer
notes
of
nutmeg
clove
and
brown
sugar
as
well
i
was
so
happy
to
taste
it
and
get
those
fresh
pumpkin
flavors
up
front
it
is
still
flavored
with
spices
but
they
are
there
supporting
the
pumpkin
flavor
as
opposed
to
overpowering
it
and
covering
it
up
truly
well
done
prost
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
great
pumpkin
and
spice
nose
first
sip
tastes
like
your
drinking
a
liquid
pumpkin
pie
very
well
priced
and
well
worth
seeking
out
if
you
enjoy
this
style
does
this
beer
make
me
think
of
pumpkin
pie
or
pumpkin
amber
and
syrupy
no
head
red
rooibos
tea
comes
to
mind
slimy
on
mouth
like
a
pumpkin
spicy
cinnamon
cloves
allspice
and
ginger
are
balanced
by
woody
hops
sage
floral
lemon
zest
coffee
and
caffeine
light
vanilla
and
peach
combine
with
spices
to
give
impression
of
herbaceous
squash
earthy
and
metallic
metal
on
palate
with
lemon
verbena
bitterness
overall
i
think
the
malt
presence
is
too
weak
in
this
beer
at
the
moment
bitter
nutty
astringent
not
yet
ripe
squash
that
is
compensated
by
heavy
spicing
served
without
butter
lacking
decadence
and
fullness
in
the
end
this
is
decidedly
just
a
pumpkin
beer
masked
by
hops
spices
and
lacking
the
an
integral
maltiness
i
didnt
imagine
myself
in
jamess
pumpkin
version
of
the
giant
peach
overall
this
should
be
everyones
standard
for
pumpkin
ales
not
pumking
pours
a
dark
cloudy
burnt
orange
caramel
with
a
medium
beige
head
aroma
and
taste
is
of
sweet
pumpkin
pie
nut
meg
some
fruity
notes
with
some
toasted
malt
and
caramel
malt
palate
is
a
medium
body
good
carbonation
and
slightly
crisp
mouth
feel
finishes
with
a
sweet
pumpkin
pie
nutmeg
flavor
with
some
toasted
grains
and
caramel
and
mild
hops
bitter
notes
for
balance
this
brew
was
quite
good
not
overly
sweet
for
pumpkin
ale
and
nicely
balanced
a
good
drinking
brew
seems
pumpkin
beers
dont
age
at
all
i
dont
think
the
flavor
in
this
one
has
changed
in
the
past
78
months
still
solid
as
ever
nice
moderately
high
carbonation
its
not
bad
its
just
got
too
many
things
missing
it
needs
more
body
and
more
alcohol
if
youre
into
the
lighter
end
of
the
spectrum
you
need
to
try
this
o
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
overall
though
lacks
depth
the
spices
arent
too
heavyhanded
but
theres
little
else
going
on
this
stuff
is
the
real
deal
a
gorgeous
reddish
amber
with
good
clarity
two
fingers
of
frothy
head
with
good
retention
and
copious
lacing
beer
stays
covered
as
i
imbibe
smell
gives
a
preview
of
the
excellence
in
the
glass
a
big
slice
of
pie
with
a
healthy
malt
backbone
that
acts
like
a
graham
cracker
crust
to
the
lovely
gourd
caressing
my
nose
with
sweetness
taste
is
full
boat
wow
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
pie
style
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
to
date
imagine
a
perfect
slice
with
a
light
sweetness
now
add
the
graham
in
the
nose
to
cradle
it
as
it
fills
your
mouth
the
swallow
is
bittered
well
by
the
hops
combined
with
ginger
in
such
a
way
that
the
hops
never
draw
attention
to
themselves
some
how
while
being
the
perfect
slice
in
the
glass
it
is
dry
and
quenching
crisp
light
feel
with
a
creamy
fullness
that
is
satisfying
and
sessionable
at
the
same
time
this
is
one
easy
drinking
beer
that
still
manages
to
be
a
full
on
style
beer
no
shirking
the
pumpkin
here
at
the
same
time
you
just
keep
filling
the
glass
and
draining
it
you
dont
get
overwhelmed
or
tired
of
it
wish
i
had
another
growler
superb

with

fairly
clear

o
the
aroma
on
this
pumpkin
beer
is
outstanding
but
the
flavors
are
really
a
big
let
down
of
the
many
and
myriad
elysian
pumpkin
beers
this
is
like
the
flagship
the
standard
the
rock
on
which
all
the
other
ones
rest
right
in
the
good
middle
of
several
possible
continuums
sweet
vs
bitter
dark
vs
light
spice
vs
malt
and
the
better
for
it
have
been
stockpiling
it
to
hopefully
last
a
few
more
weeks
as
it
is
now
almost
gone
from
stores
for
2013

o
pretty
good
pumpkin
brew
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
and
i
cant
believe
there
is
actually
7
lbs
of
pumpkin

barrel

very
fresh

pumpkin

and

i
can
even
probably
in
my
mind
small
some
whipped
cream
on
top
great
stuff
taste
is
very
similar
like
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
smoothie
with
a
dash
of
alcohol
lovely
nice
mouth
feel
smooth
and
low
carbonation
overall
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
though
even
with
that
recommendation
one
would
be
enough
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
an
outstanding
seasonal
pick
this
was
my
first
elysian
brew
and
can
say
they
did
it
right
the
5
9
was
decent
for
the
abv
though
a
bit
pricey
i
would
definitely
buy
this
great
seasonal
brew
again
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
spice
flavors
or
just
dont
like
pumpkin
pie
i
could
see
why
that
person
would
rate
lower
but
if
you
like
pumpkin
youd
be
happy
with
this
pumpkin
ale
total
3450
o
not
bad
doesnt
really
fall
into
the
refreshing
category
but
it
not
so
overly
sweet
or
spiced
as
to
be
cloying
for
those
who
want
a
mediumbodied
pumpkin
ale
distinctively
spiced
but
no
overpowering
this
could
be
the
one
overall
a
beer
that
started
off
with
such
promise
and
try
as
i
might
i
cannot
get
past
that
metallic
twinge
it
seems
to
have
sullied
an
otherwise
outstanding
take
on
the
style
without
any
information
telling
me
i
should
do
otherwise
i
have
no
choice
but
to
dock
the
taste
of
this
beer
however
i
would
encourage
others
to
try
it
as
my
experience
seems
like
an
outlier
a
rather
pleasant
and
fulfilling
pumpkin
ale
full
stop
though
im
at
a
bit
of
a
loss
as
to
what
contribution
the
pumpkin
seeds
added
to
the
mix
im
sure
its
there
in
a
dutiful
supporting
role
under
the
radar
and
all
that
everything
else
simply
puts
out
beyond
expectations
providing
a
stellar
drinkability
one
irrelevant
to
seasonal
affectation
guilty
o
im
amazed
how
much
flavor
is
packed
into
this
6
beer
as
mentioned
it
is
like
drinking
fall
in
a
glass
it
has
all
the
nice
spices
and
pumpkin
and
they
are
harmonized
really
well
nothing
dominates
it
all
mixes
in
a
real
smooth
way
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
get
this
please
overall
this
is
hands
down
the
best
nonimperial
pumpkin
ale
i
have
come
across
the
balance
is
just
about
perfect
exceeds
everything
i
thought
possible
of
the
style
i
always
thought
of
pumpkin
beers
as
a
kind
of
novelty
but
this
one
goes
to
prove
they
can
be
just
as
delicious
as
they
are
festive
overall
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
easily
the
best
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
one
i
would
highly
encourage
you
incredibly
affordable
less
than
5
bucks
for
a
bomber
poured
this
cold
beer
into
a
pounder
glass
rich
in
foggy
amber
fall
color
in
the
bottle
it
smelled
like
a
seasonal
gift
store
in
the
glass
it
smelled
more
like
a
heavily
pumpkin
spiced
beer
the
first
very
cold
taste
seemed
unpalatable
i
let
it
warm
close
to
room
temperature
and
things
came
around
flavors
married
though
flavors
were
less
intense
spices
tend
to
burst
around
the
mouth
and
are
a
bit
too
prominent
tastes
to
me
as
if
pumpkin
spice
was
simply
shaken
into
my
beer
overall
upper
echelon
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
if
you
are
leary
about
pumpkin
beers
like
me
this
will
be
my
choice
this
halloween
what
a
great
brew
for
october
fun
the
pumpkin
hits
as
soon
as
you
pop
the
top
and
stays
all
the
way
through
the
taste
smellcolor
the
pumpkin
stays
after
till
you
go
to
bed
gotta
have
it
to
share
at
all
the
halloween
activities
could
cary
over
to
thansgiving
but
thats
it
this
beer
manages
to
replicate
the
flavor
of
a
slice
of
fresh
pumpkin
pie
earthy
spicy
warm
and
inviting
satisfying
aftertaste
very
tasty
definitely
worth
having
again
while
its
around
othis
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
and
an
especially
good
example
of
sweeter
more
pielike
traditional
pumpkin
beers
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
drink
this
beer
yearround
but
it
will
easily
go
headtohead
with
my
other
favorite
pumpkin
beers
e
g
dogfishhead
and
upslope
if
you
want
a
beer
that
tastes
like
pie
and
sometimes
i
do
this
is
a
good
choice
seriously
aroma
is
that
of
classic
pumpkin
pie
spices
nutmeg
clove
allspice
and
cinnamon
possibly
too
much
no
malt
or
hop
aroma
to
speak
of
appearance
pale
burnt
orange
slightly
murky
head
fades
quickly
flavor
those
spices
come
fast
and
furious
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
giving
way
to
a
sweet
malt
finish
not
sure
about
any
pumpkin
coming
through
but
those
spices
still
convince
you
theres
a
pie
in
there
somewhere
mouthfeel
low
to
moderate
carbonation
with
medium
body
overall
impression
if
your
idea
of
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
is
that
of
classic
pumpkin
pie
spices
yet
with
a
definite
this
is
still
a
beer
ale
finish
then
youll
really
enjoy
this
pumpkin
ale
i
know
i
did
this
really
is
a
wonderful
brew
despite
its
flaws
i
do
love
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
and
how
fantastic
the
aroma
is
overall
an
excellent
sweetstyle
pumpkin
beer
i
really
dont
like
sweet
beers
but
this
really
tastes
like
a
roasted
pumpkin
pie
well
without
the
pumpkin
flavor
the
balance
is
awesome
and
it
finished
dry
enough
to
keep
it
very
drinkable
mo
medium
level
of
carbonation
thinplus
bodied
the
acidity
comes
too
much
at
the
expense
of
the
balance
and
all
in
all
i
cant
understand
what
the
flavour
profile
tries
to
deliver
to
me
i
suppose
really
this
ale
cannot
be
consumed
past
its
suggested
best
before
date
o
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
of
the
many
i
tried
i
could
session
this
and
not
get
tired
of
it
overall
its
perfectly
crafted
and
it
is
a
must
try
o
above
average
nice
tasty
aromatic
brew
thumbs
up
overall
above
average
and
seems
to
represent
the
style
if
you
like
pumpkin
beers
you
should
try
it
if
you
could
care
less
and
would
rather
have
a
sweet
potato
pie
grab
another
beer
overall
best
one
ive
had
this
year
and
the
best
one
ive
had
overall
have
one
more
bomber
im
going
to
keep
for
a
few
months
and
see
if
it
melds
together
a
bit
more
but
happy
to
finally
enjoy
this
one
again
o
beer
is
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
as
far
as
pumpkin
flavor
as
the
spices
seem
to
cover
it
up
throughout
i
could
sit
through
4
or
6
of
these
and
be
happy
with
my
choice
but
i
think
if
youre
looking
for
that
robust
presence
of
pumpkin
there
are
other
choices
ps
i
am
not
a
pumkin
ale
guy
going
for
ipas
stouts
porters
belgians
so
this
beer
really
surprised
me
as
a
great
fall
after
dinner
or
cheese
course
beer
well
done
and
possibly
the
best
in
class
o
this
in
my
book
sets
the
standard
for
what
a
normal
session
pumpkin
ale
should
be
likegreat
beer
pours
a
ruddy
amber
hue
carbonated
with
some
minute
sediment
present
bubbly
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
in
its
wake
the
aroma
is
nice
with
sugary
malts
graham
cracker
nutmeg
pumpkin
and
citrusy
hops
i
find
the
flavor
to
be
rather
straight
forward
its
an
apa
with
subtle
pumpkinspice
characteristics
in
the
finish
its
a
bit
watery
and
thin
i
would
recommend
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
apa
based
session
beer
otherwise
there
are
far
better
tasting
beers
of
the
pumpkin
persuasion
overall
a
little
out
of
season
but
its
held
up
pretty
well
the
carbonation
is
a
little
low
and
the
beer
seems
a
little
watery
the
spice
level
is
good
but
it
needs
more
pumpkin
a
very
drinkable
fall
beer
but
nothing
that
has
the
wow
factor
i
remembered
it
being
better
the
last
time
i
had
it
it
just
didnt
seem
to
have
the
same
kick
this
time
still
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
but
obviously
not
the
great
pumpkin
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
brew
i
am
just
not
tasting
much
pumpkin
very
drinkable
a
decent
very
sessionable
brew
though
final
thoughts
it
may
be
a
little
watery
and
over
carbonated
but
elysian
night
owl
is
not
by
any
means
a
bad
beer
it
looks
great
and
hits
all
the
right
flavor
notes
its
slightly
low
abv
also
makes
it
very
approachable
in
bomber
format
and
id
highly
recommend
it
to
any
bmc
drinkers
as
a
way
to
convert
them
would
i
drink
it
again
probably
not
its
also
not
sold
in
my
state
pours
amber
with
a
healthy
amount
of
yeast

easily

much
in
terms
of

nutmeg
and
clove
present
on
the
nose
slightly
sour
style
tastes
reveals
cinnamon
and
some
bready
heartiness
one
of
my
last
pumpkin
beers
of
the
year
its
about
time
i
got
around
to
this
one
not
among
my
favorite
elysian
pumpkins
its
still
a
satisfying
brew
for
the
fall
season
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
a
good
handful
of
other
craft
interpretations
of
the
style
o
not
really
big
on
pumpkin
flavor
and
was
my
least
favorite
in
the
pumpkin
beer
series
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
yellow
color
a
bit
chunky
and
a
small
to
no
white
head
in
the
aroma
big
cinnamon
and
allspice
all
the
way
through
in
the
taste
big
spice
quite
heavy
on
the
cinnamon
with
nutmeg
and
allspice
and
notes
of
gourd
a
spice
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
body
with
a
dry
over
use
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
in
the
aftertaste
overuse
of
cinnamon
and
big
spice
presence
although
just
about
average
22
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
no
bottle
dating
but
was
purchased
recently
pours
hazy
orange
amber
color
with
a
1
finger
fairly
dense
off
white
head
with
nice
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin
cap
that
lingers
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
aromas
of
big
authentic
pumpkin
clove
allspice
caramel
gingerbread
toast
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
light
herbal
fantastic
aromas
with
great
strength
and
balance
this
smells
like
i
opened
a
can
of
pumpkin
puree
very
authentic
taste
of
big
pumpkin
cinnamon
nutmeg
gingerbread
caramel
toast
allspice
clove
and

on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of

on
the

for
a
good

zero
cloying

fairly

and
lightly
syrupy

is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
nearly
zero

noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
absolutely
incredible
pumpkin
ale
great
authentic
pumpkin
flavor
with
well
balanced
spices
extremely
smooth
to
drink
easily
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
pumpkin
ale
style
oi
was
surprised
with
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
not
a
huge
pumpkin
fan
but
the
blend
of
flavors
was
very
tasty
will
definitely
drink
this
again
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
put
it
up
there
with
schlafly
ccb
and
uinta
oak
jacked
as
my
favorites
for
the
style
would
definitely
have
again
lots
of
pumpkin
flavor
with
a
nice
spice
profile
and
a
good
malt
base
what
else
could
one
want
this
didnt
particularly
blow
me
away
in
any
category
but
its
solid
o
a
highly
drinkable
and
flavorful
pumpkin
ale
not
the
best
example
but
still
very
good
well
blended
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetnessspice
ratio
this
unnerving
feeling
takes
me
back
to
a
time
in
rome
not
that
i
was
time
traveling
back
to
the
glory
days
of
gladiator
fights
and
chariot
races
but
a
trip
i
had
where
an
experience
left
me
guessing
forever
so
im
back
at
the
hostel
with
a
slew
of
two
euro
bottles
of
wine
and
run
into
the
other
cast
members
of
that
week
i
happily
share
my
wealth
and
drinking
breeds
more
drinking
so
we
all
wander
off
to
a
club
this
is
where
somebody
drugged
me
when
i
come
to
im
back
in
my
room
and
see
this
smokin
girl
from
israel
right
in
my
face
my
shirt
is
being
pulled
off
i
black
out
i
wake
up
in
the
morning
with
three
chinese
girls
across
the
room
staring
at
me
and
giggling
i
was
in
my
bed
with
nothing
on
but
my
underwear
halfway
up
there
was
what
seemed
like
dried
blood
all
over
the
place
all
over
me
the
bed
and
the
floor
i
later
found
out
that
this
was
wine
which
was
puked
up
and
i
puked
all
over
the
girl
and
her
belongings
what
i
never
found
out
is
what
happened
did
she
take
advantage
of
me
and
sex
me
up
without
me
knowing
i
dont
know
where
did
my
clothes
go
i
dont
know
similar
feeling
with
all
these
pumpkin
beers
i
dont
know
dont
love
em
dont
hate
em
just
dont
know
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
to
date
extremely
smooth
goes
down
easy
and
very
well
rounded
brew
theres
a
pumpkin
flavor
and
good
spice
qualities
but
theyre
not
overwhelming
the
color
smell
and
mouth
feel
are
nothing
spectacular
so
the
greatness
of
this
beer
really
is
in
the
details
of
the
taste
o
the
scent
and
flavour
are
both
incredibly
bold
and
do
well
to
represent
the
flavours
and
scents
of
the
fall
season
the
mix
of
pumpkin
spices
ginger
and
the
hints
of
chocolate
dont
mask
the
fact
that
this
definitely
an
ale
worth
trying
at
least
once
o
its
pretty
good
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumkin
beers
in
general
usually
too
sweet
and
artificial
but
i
finished
and
enjoyed
this
bottle
spiced
with
flavors
more
typical
of
apple
pie
than
pumpkincaramel
and
mild
apple
notes
emerge
from
the
typical
spice
profile
of
cinnamon
clove
nutmegthis
beer
is
smooth
balanced
and
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
has
a
penchant
for
pumpkin
brews
definitely
among
my
top
five
for
beers
with
autumnal
drinking
in
mind
first
brew
from
elysian
and
i
am
not
disappointed
in
the
least
i
love
the
different
takes
on
pumpkin
brews
and
this
one
is
unique
in
its
own
right
id
look
for
this
one
again
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
copper
color
body
and
dont
have
any
head
or
lace
to
it
the
smell
is
strong
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
with
a
hint
of
nutmeg
the
taste
is
very
spicy
of
the
the
spicies
from
the
smell
with
just
a
hint
of
pumpkin
peeping
through
on
the
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
good
and
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
better
and
worse
it
is
aboe
average
but
exceptional
o
a
completely
different
beer
from
first
pour
to
second
the
second
pour
is
much
better
solid
pumpkin
mixed
in
to
an
easy
drinking
ale
is
always
a
good
time
spices
get
a
little
overbearing
at
times
but
its
quickly
made
up
for
with
another
sip
of
squashy
goodness
each
sip
makes
it
better
and
thats
hard
to
do
with
the
style
onot
the
best
certainly
not
the
worst
example
of
the
style
ive
had
i
think
they
put
too
much
emphasis
on
getting
pumpkin
flavor
into
the
beer
and
missed
the
balance
of
spices
that
should
compliment
the
type
of
texture
that
comes
with
adding
pumpkin
to
a
beer
it
does
make
a
nice
fall
beer
however
brilliant
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
ever
had
has
a
very
pumpkiny
taste
to
it
that
is
not
overpowered
by
the
alcohol
like
so
many
other
pumpkin
ales
its
really
standout
beer
the
looks
is
beautiful
and
dark
and
the
smell
is
just
absolutely
amazing
although
i
would
say
most
pumpkin
ales
smell
brilliant
another
gem
in
the
pumpkin
category
im
glad
more
and
more
craft
brewers
have
listened
to
demand
and
are
churning
out
these
seasonal
brews
in
spite
of
protests
from
purists
hey
if
it
tastes
good
i
really
dont
need
lectures
on
what
really
makes
a
beer
o
not
a
bad
beer
especially
in
gulps
but
not
as
tasty
as
i
was
anticipating
wouldnt
recommend
even
if
id
have
another
quite
nice
give
it
a
try
o
nice
for
the
style
without
the
overwhelming
spicy
profile
deep
copper
orange
in
color
with
a
thick
unfiltered
viscous
look
poured
with
a
short
offwhite
foam
that
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
sweet
earthy
pumpkin
aroma
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
the
perfect
touch
of
spice
at
the
back
end
for
balance
soft
delicate
lagerlike
feel
with
slightly
creamy
carbonation
a
wonderful
balance
of
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
sweet
pumpkin
from
top
to
bottom
a
light
tangy
bitter
hoppiness
in
the
middle
finishes
off
the
spice
leaving
a
clean
sweetness
at
the
finish
this
is
a
fabulous
pumpkin
ale
very
impressive
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
head
and
no
lace
the
aroma
is
of
pumpkins
with
spices
and
a
hint
of
toast
the
flavor
begins
with
pumpkins
followed
through
with
lots
of
ginger
and
mild
bread
crust
notes
theres
a
good
balance
between
the
pumpkin
and
ginger
its
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
smooth
elysian
night
owl
pumpkin
ale
is
a
good
brew
great
on
a
cool
fall
evening
recommended
overall
was
not
disappointed
with
this
brew
at
all
at
first
tasting
it
was
an
instant
hit
with
my
beer
expectations
i
was
very
impressed
and
the
more
that
i
sipped
the
more
i
noticed
something
different
with
this
brew
its
something
that
leaves
you
craving
more
and
if
your
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
i
strongly
recommend
this
one
enjoyable
to
the
fullest
cheers
overall
great
stuff
by
elysian
they
made
a
point
of
showcasing
the
pumpkin
of
this
ale
rather
than
just
the
spices
associated
with
pumpkin
pie
price
was
reasonable
5
50bomber
and
it
delivered
on
the
flavour
front
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
strong
here
too
but
it
never
felt
that
way
as
took
my
sips
down
my
pint
glass
this
would
go
great
with
a
big
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
and
cool
whip
on
top
and
for
anyone
looking
for
a
good
beer
to
celebrate
the
changing
of
the
seasons
with
this
would
easily
suffice
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
clear
copper
color
with
nearly
no
head
on
top
there
was
just
some
scattered
bubbles
on
top
of
this
and
no
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
spicy
very
much
autumn
scented
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
balanced
between
the
malts
and
the
spices
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
watery
side
in
my
opinion
it
finished
very
dry
also
overall
this
beer
was
decent
and
i
might
drink
it
again
one
day
but
i
wouldnt
see
myself
running
out
to
buy
a
case
or
anything
next
fall
o
i
found
this
pumpkin
beer
to
be
enjoyable
because
it
didnt
taste
artificial
and
there
was
a
nice
balance
between
flavors
of
pumpkins
and
pumpkin
spices
o
a
very
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
probably
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
had
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
is
great
for
a
nice
fall
day
probably
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
to
date
and
really
blows
away
most
of
them
out
there
elysian
really
knows
there
pumpkins
overall
a
more
roasty
and
dry
pumpkin
brew
with
a
very
interesting
feel
give
it
a
go
if
you
have
a
chance
o
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
with
great
pumpkin
flavors
and
lighter
pumpkin
pie
spices
nice
complexity
and
not
overly
sweet
this
is
the
first
pumpkin
beer
that
ive
had
that
tastes
like
actual
fresh
pumpkin
its
different
in
a
good
way
i
still
prefer
sweeter
pumpkin
ales
as
i
think
of
it
as
a
dessertlike
beer
but
this
works
pretty
well
and
is
definitely
worth
having
overall
the
smell
started
off
strong
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
squash
like
taste
of
the
beer
o
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
the
best
nonimperial
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
i
have
found
this
to
be
a
weak
pumpkin
ale
and
i
am
puzzled
by
the
good
reviews
it
has
received
i
would
put
wyerbacher
post
road
and
smuttynose
pumpkin
ales
before
this
one
overall
this
is
another
excellent
pumpkin
beer
by
elysian
almost
as
good
as
the
great
pumpkin
and
better
then
dark
o
the
moon
plus
its
easy
to
find
and
fairly
cheap
which
combined
with
the
great
flavors
and
easy
drinkablity
means
i
will
be
drinking
this
one
all
fall
o
overall
this
is
probably
my
number
one
pumpkin
ale
right
now
i
can
really
enjoy
pumpking
from
southern
tier
and
comparitively
this
is
clearly
more
drinkable
with
a
lower
abv
and
slightly
more
complexity
the
big
selling
point
though
is
that
it
is
more
of
an
authentic
pumpkin
ale
vs
an
overspiced
brown
ale
very
well
done
and
highly
recommended
well
the
beer
looked
great
in
the
grocery
store
promising
a
hearty
ale
perfect
for
the
first
chilly
evenings
of
fall
open
the
beer
though
and
things
go
downhill
fast
a
freefall
into
mediocrity
first
off
the
brew
is
devastatingly
undercarbonated
an
attribute
that
contributes
to
a
flat
thin
flavor
and
slightly
grainy
texture
second
of
all
the
beer
smells
like
the
holiday
section
of
walgreens
only
less
saccharine
and
for
the
record
i
am
not
against
pumpkin
ales
quite
the
contrary
i
love
the
full
hearty
festive
flavor
of
a
wellbrewed
pumpkin
i
am
also
not
against
elysian
they
make
a
fantastic
amber
one
of
the
best
but
the
night
owl
flew
away
with
all
the
body
and
flavor
somewhere
before
bottling
the
medium
body
supports
it
all
well
it
smooth
enough
with
a
nippy
crispness
that
doesnt
fade
neither
too
sweet
nor
too
dry
the
feel
works
well
in
this
beer
o
very
impressed
after
a
string
of
disappointing
pumpkin
beers
this
one
hits
the
mark
extremely
fragrant
with
a
ton
of
flavor
and
not
fake
at
all
a
solid
straightup
pumpkin
ale
this
year
2013
was
a
big
disappointment
substantially
less
sediment
than
previous
years
and
the
taste
is
not
as
rich
or
sweet
the
aroma
is
similar
but
overall
it
is
at
best
a
bland
pumpkin
beer
with
an
unfortunate
bitter
finish
every
year
for
the
past
three
years
i
have
had
friends
visit
to
try
the
elysian
night
owl
they
cleaned
me
out
of
2
cases
in
past
years
but
this
year
one
bottle
and
they
were
ready
to
try
something
else
good
thing
i
tried
a
six
pack
before
committing
to
a
case
one
thing
i
have
learned
since
i
began
drinking
pumpkin
ales
over
10
years
ago
since
they
are
a
craft
brew
they
vary
substantially
from
year
to
year
best
to
sample
a
couple
bottles
before
choosing
one
to
buy
in
quantity
it
looks
like
harpoon
ufo
is
a
winner
this
year
picked
up
a
12oz
bottle
which
was
good
because
a
bomber
or
a
sixer
would
be
way
too
much
orange
color
with
good
lacing
but
it
also
has
a
lot
of
particulate
floating
throughout
strong
smell
of
the
typical
pumpkin
pie
spices
flavor
is
pumpkin
nutmeg
spicy
this
is
good
but
i
really
dont
want
too
much
of
it
kind
of
overpowering
overall
good
pumpkin
ale
that
is
not
quite
on
par
with
elysians
great
pumpkin
and
schlaflys
pumpkin
ale
looking
forward
to
opening
a
bottle
of
great
pumpkin
soon
to
compare
overall
it
either
this
or
devious
but
i
am
looking
to
get
a
case
of
this
stuff
good
pumpkin
ale
indeed
combines
the
flavor
of
the
imperial
pumpkin
ales
with
the
drinkability
of
the
session
pumpkin
ales
pours
a
brilliant
orange
leaving
little
head
and
minimal
lacing
this
beer
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
big
allspice
and
nutmeg
on
the
nose
taste
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
smell
but
pulls
through
quite
nicely
mouthfeel
is
medium
slight
bitterness
in
the
back
end
overall
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
and
probably
one
of
the
best
examples
i
like
the
new
six
pack
option
seek
out
for
those
who
enjoy
the
style
a
well
done
pumpkin
beer
easy
to
distinguish
the
style
and
pumpkin
and
spices
used
but
they
were
not
overwhelming
as
can
easily
happen
in
the
style
probably
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
but
i
confess
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style

there
is

i
get
some

as
some

overall
night
owl
is
a
great
seasonal
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
and
while
i
appreciate
that
this
isnt
exactly
orthodox
night
owl
served
from
a
frosted
pint
glass
is
one
of
the
best
things
about
october
in
seattle
that
said
i
have
noticed
as
have
other
aficionados
ive
conferred
with
that
night
owl
exhibits
no
small
degree
of
quality
variance
from
yeartoyear
and
maybe
even
batchtobatch
this
pumpkin
beer
features
a
cooked
pumpkin
taste
as
opposed
to
pumpkin
pie
taste
the
color
looks
as
though
someone
dropped
a
pumpkin
into
the
glassbottle
the
smell
and
taste
are
consistent
with
the
cooked
pumpkin
theory
this
is
one
true
american
style
beer
picking
up
overall
i
feel
like
this
beer
fills
an
important
void
in
the
craft
beer
fall
seasonal
world
it
is
genuine
pumpkin
as
i
mentioned
above
it
isnt
just
pumpkin
flavored
bubble
gum
or
pumpkin
pie
spices
overwhelming
the
actual
pumpkin
it
is
pumpkin
and
there
should
be
a
place
for
that
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
mahogany
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
bursting
with
fresh
baked
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
mild
by
comparison
some
pumpkin
malty
a
bit
of
spice
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
o
a
favorite
fall
northwest
beer
o
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
that
does
everything
right
but
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
crowd
much
o
elysians
night
owl
is
yet
another
in
a
long
line
of
decent
yet
unspectacular
pumpkin
ales
though
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
nothing
to
get
worked
up
about
and
not
something
ill
seek
out
again
night
owl
isnt
as
good
as
expected
but
its
not
bad
either
a
smooth
blend
with
no
outstanding
flavors
its
nice
they
actually
use
pumpkin
in
this
i
hate
ones
that
are
only
spices
spices
are
subdued
and
balanced
in
this
one
with
a
thicker
rich
mouthfeel
than
most
other
similar
beers
very
tasty
o
not
one
of
the
best
pumpkins
ive
had
but
if
one
likes
more
spice
in
their
beer
than
this
is
for
you
fall
seasonal
12
bbl
kegs
22
oz
bottles
really
good
tastes
exactly
how
fall
should
the
mouthfeel
starts
chewy
then
finishes
a
little
thin
and
watery
drinkability
color
me
pretty
shocked
with
this
and
this
is
a
brew
also
that
wont
break
your
wallet
i
get
any
new
pumpkin
ales
i
can
find
that
ive
never
had
and
though
i
hoped
to
enjoy
this
i
didnt
expect
the
depth
of
flavor
and
balance
definitely
try
it
and
pick
up
a
few
if
you
see
it
i
will
if
i
can
find
it
again
nice
pumpkin
beer
nice
tastes
of
pumpkin
pie
without
the
overwhelming
sweetness
all
around
this
is
very
impressive
pumpkin
ale
with
plenty
of
true
to
style
character
the
only
room
for
improvement
i
see
is
a
bit
more
pronounced
spice
in
the
flavor
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
has
a
nice
smooth
feel
and
a
nice
flavor
i
wouldnt
mind
a
few
glasses
of
this
on
a
nice
fall
evening
overall
i
think
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
the
only
thing
is
that
some
of
the
flavors
seem
to
be
a
tad
watered
down
fix
that
and
i
think
it
would
bring
this
up
to
another
level
it
is
still
a
good
beer
though
and
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
overall
well
done
elysian
i
am
not
a
hard
core
pumpkin
beer
drinker
but
this
is
good
very
balanced
the
spices
are
not
inyourface
yet
you
have
the
main
pumpkin
flavors
45
o
pretty
darn
good
id
buy
it
again
but
if
i
had
a
request
it
would
be
please
brew
more
great
pumpkin
instead
of
this
and
send
me
a
case
of
gp
despite
the
beer
brewed
with
spices
label
specifically
nutmeg
o
pretty
mild
for
a
pumpkin
beer
split
out
of
a
22oz
bomber
on
halloween
this
one
was
just
ok
for
me
happy
to
now
be
past
the
halloween
beers
and
looking
forward
to
winter
ales
now
coming
into
season
mouthfeel
is
moderately
thick
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
nice
complex
beer
that
melds
the
aroma
of
a
pumkin
pie
with
the
chewy
velvity
smooth
pumpkin
flavor
i
am
very
impressed
by
this
guy
opumpkin
ales
are
so
often
great
in
theory
but
terrible
in
execution
dont
get
me
wrong
i
dig
a
highly
spiced
ale
but
the
fact
that
this
carries
the
day
without
being
overspiced
or
oversweeted
underscores
the
quality
well
done
pours
a
clear
copper
orange
with
a
2
inch
puffy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
thin
broken
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
pumpkin
puree
roasted
pumpkin
seeds
and
some
subdued
pumpkin
pie
spices
taste
is
of
breadlike
malt
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
seeds
and
a
very
nice
balance
of
the
typical
pumpkin
pie
spices
this
beer
is
not
overpowering
with
the
spices
as
others
i
have
tried
before
this
beer
has
a
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
very
smooth
overall
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
that
doesnt
beat
you
over
the
head
with
spices
this
is
in
my
top
3
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
thus
far
in
my
beer
drinking
career
mmm
wow
yummy
this
one
pours
a
pumpkin
pie
orange
with
a
jovial
white
bubbly
foam
and
a
nose
of
spice
and
vanilla
taste
is
sharp
at
first
like
a
nip
of
bourbon
but
mellows
down
to
an
earthy
dryness
squashy
definitely
made
with
fresh
pumpkin
a
residual
sweetness
maybe
caramel
or
brown
sugar
very
very
well
balanced
for
a
spiced
beer
lowish
abv
makes
this
sessionable
in
the
fall
but
then
again
i
say
every
beer
is
sessionable
in
the
right
setting
first
try
from
this
brewer
and
will
seek
out
more
theyve
got
this
one
down
one
of
the
better
pumpkins
ive
had
this
season
the
cheaper
price
makes
it
a
go
to
for
me
this
fall
o
meh
mundane
when
compared
to
other
pumpkin
beers
but
because
of
the
abv
its
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
quite
different
from
other
spiced
pumpkin
beers
they
went
with
a
milder
approach
decent
beer
and
i
would
have
it
again
overall
a
wonderful
holidaypumpkinspiced
beer
though
it
doesnt
scream
pumpkin
it
has
all
those
nice
little
touches
that
make
it
a
good
beer
with
the
addition
of
some
wonderful
pumpkin
pie
spices
drinkable
though
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
and
this
beer
is
now
easily
one
of
my
top
2
or
three
of
the
style
i
cant
believe
i
havent
tasted
this
until
now
i
only
hope
i
can
pick
up
another
bomber
or
two
o
at
the
top
theres
a
feel
like
yourre
going
to
get
with
flavor
much
more
than
you
actually
get
the
bland
combo
of
flavors
kind
of
go
all
over
then
die
off
to
a
relatively
weird
place
sort
of
a
soapycinamon
ending
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
nothing
terribly
exciting
going
on
but
well
executed
very
drinkable
o
it
took
me
a
couple
of
sips
to
warm
up
to
this
one
but
i
see
what
elysian
was
going
for
here
really
nice
now
to
get
my
hands
on
the
great
pumpkin
o
this
is
a
totally
different
take
on
the
style
and
i
like
it
i
think
they
need
to
dial
back
the
ginger
just
a
bit
and
help
bring
the
body
into
coordination
with
the
flavors
really
solid
pumpkin
pie
sweetness
without
being
overbearing
loved
the
look
and
mouthfeel
one
of
my
favorites
clear
red
amber
with
two
fingers
of
cream
white
pillowy
head
great
lacings
for
a
veggie
beer
head
lasts
until
the
halfway
point
smell
is
nice
pumpkin
presence
with
spices
that
have
faded
like
pumpkin
not
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
like
a
nice
pale
ale
drank
from
a
pumpkin
not
too
sweet
like
most
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
fine
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
finish
is
slightly
wet
with
minimal
bitterness
well
balanced
i
think
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
not
get
tired
of
the
pumpkin
flavor
well
done
elysian
a
sessionable
pumpkin
ale
the
darkest
pumpkin
beer
ive
reviewed
yet
a
lovely
deep
amber
hue
with
some
cream
on
the
top
sweet
brown
sugar
pumpkin
flesh
and
allspice
on
the
nose
beautiful
template
for
flavor
cinnamon
and
clove
mesh
on
the
tongue
with
sweet
brown
sugar
medium
light
body
has
a
load
of
miniature
carbonation
to
hail
in
the
nectar
of
the
fall
o
hmm
this
one
works
best
for
its
subtleties
nothing
fantastic
or
big
here
but
an
enjoyable
example
of
a
nonimperial
pumpkin
decent
pumpkin
beer
its
not
outstanding
but
there
are
worse
solid
but
not
spectacular
its
a
step
below
the
dfh
punkin
and
the
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
o
first
pumpkin
brew
of
the
season
this
one
came
through
pretty
much
as
expected
im
really
quite
interested
in
their
bigger
offerings
according
to
thier
website
they
use
an
abudence
of
pumpkin
and
spices
throughout
thier
brewing
process
but
to
me
this
is
a
very
weak
flavored
pumpkin
ale
beer
wise
its
pretty
good
just
lacks
o
very
drinkable
spiced
pumpkin
ale
that
is
quite
yeasty
bronze
pour
with
a
white
head
nose
is
a
nice
soft
pumpkin
meat
with
light
cinnamon
and
autumn
spices
pumpkin
pie
mouth
is
more
dry
than
i
expected
a
fairly
assertive
hop
presence
some
pumpkin
meat
and
spices
in
the
finish
but
not
as
wellexpressed
as
in
the
nose
nice
nose
decent
beer
o
elysian
night
owl
is
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
if
not
somewhat
forgettable
the
appearance
and
nose
are
very
good
but
the
taste
and
overly
carbonated
mouthfeel
were
a
bit
of
a
letdown
try
it
if
you
see
it
but
a
sam
adams
harvest
pumpkin
will
do
just
as
well
elysian
night
owl
is
a
solid
copper
ale
with
a
few
tiny
particles
and
a
thick
yellowish
foam
that
lasts
all
night
and
leaves
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
very
spicy
aroma
with
lots
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
probably
pumpkin
is
the
nose
theres
a
sweet
brown
sugar
type
of
smell
its
incredibly
soft
and
smooth
its
full
bodied
and
it
kind
of
leaves
the
mouth
grudgingly
afterwords
my
tongue
feels
kind
of
grainy
but
its
very
silky
while
the
beer
is
still
in
my
mouth
tart
caramelly
malt
with
some
medicinal
hops
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
all
are
tied
up
pretty
evenly
to
make
a
well
balanced
flavor
at
the
finish
theres
a
sort
of
green
apple
sourness
some
parts
of
the
flavor
seem
belgian
to
me
but
i
cant
narrow
down
why
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
beer
thats
difficult
to
pin
down
stylistically
its
here
to
deliver
pumpkin
and
spice
and
it
does
so
this
beer
is
filling
drinking
this
bottle
feels
like
eating
a
loaf
of
bread
d
very
solid
pumpkin
ale
that
had
a
nice
mixture
of
actual
pumpkin
and
spice
i
feel
most
pumpkin
ales
overdue
one
or
the
other
but
this
one
struck
a
nice
balance
between
the
two
overall
experience
a
great
pumpkin
beer
first
time
and
is
creeping
its
way
up
the
ladder
the
beer
itself
was
very
reasonable
the
flavor
is
not
to
over
the
top
the
abv
is
appropriate
and
just
a
great
tasting
beer
overall
good
looking
forward
to
the
other
elysian
pumpkins
o
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
not
my
favorite
think
some
others
i
was
with
really
enjoyed
it
but
i
like
them
a
bit
sweeter
and
with
more
nutmeggingerbread
to
them
would
give
it
another
shot
overall
a
very
decent
brew
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
otherwise
it
just
tastes
like
a
rather
bland
ale
with
a
funky
aftertaste
once
the
the
spice
aroma
unveils
itself
however
it
is
quite
nice
o
a
decent
beer
nice
change
in
style
this
only
leaves
me
jonseing
for
the
likes
of
pumpking
and
the
dogfish
head
releases
wish
the
local
brewery
wouldve
hit
it
out
of
the
park
poured
clear
orangecopper
with
a
nice
head
malts
in
the
nose
and
some
pumpkin
pretty
much
straightup
malts
and
the
pumpkin
and
spice
is
not
too
spectacular
as
opposed
to
other
brews
of
the
style
like
when
i
order
a
pumpkin
beer
i
want
pumpkin
and
spice
no
need
for
subtlety
lightmedium
mouthfeel
a
bit
watered
down
fairly
drinkable
but
not
worth
going
out
of
the
way
for
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
it
actually
tasted
more
like
pumpkin
to
me
instead
of
a
spice
bomb
the
sweetness
also
really
helped
balance
out
those
spices
probably
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
top
5
maybe
drinkability
bit
of
a
novelty
but
half
a
bomber
would
be
perfect
probably
one
of
the
top
2
or
three
pumpkin
ales
out
there
id
be
curious
to
have
a
blend
with
half
of
it
barrel
aged
d
its
fairly
tasty
but
they
went
the
spice
route
rather
than
the
pumpkin
route
flavour
wise
which
i
am
getting
tired
of
with
many
pumpkin
beers
worth
drinking
but
not
a
stand
out
had
this
last
night
pours
an
orangeruby
somewhat
hazy
color
looks
very
tasty
finger
width
head
that
disappears
quickly
with
minimal
lacing
smells
amazing
not
overpowered
by
the
spices
they
are
just
detectable
cloves
cinnamon
nutmeg
pumpkin
i
think
my
stomach
growled
wow
this
is
delicious
awesome
balance
of
flavors
you
can
definitely
tell
you
are
drinking
a
pumpkin
ale
but
so
not
overpowering
its
tasty
great
carbonation
refreshing
crisp
and
clean
i
could
drink
this
all
night
4
5
across
the
board
on
this
one
and
added
to
my
list
of
favs
d
the
flavours
are
quite
tasty
but
the
spice
presence
is
a
little
too
strong
and
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
of
this
particular
one
a
worthy
offering
to
any
pumpkin
ale
fan
and
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
outstanding
drinkability
this
is
the
most
aromatic
and
flavorful
pumpkin
ale
you
can
buy
at
this
level
of
abv
thanks
to
hopsbreath
for
this
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
tastes
exactly
like
pumpkin
and
spices
has
a
big
head
which
dissolves
pretty
quickly
does
not
really
smell
like
much
but
with
the
first
sip
you
can
tell
you
are
drinking
a
pumpkin
ale
drinkabilty
is
excellent
a
lot
of
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tasted
are
way
to
sweet
and
this
one
balances
out
just
right
literally
tastes
like
your
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
overall
im
impressed
a
well
balanced
and
blended
rendition
of
the
style
a
nice
change
from
some
of
the
extreme
overpowering
pumpkin
beers
not
one
youll
necessary
remember
but
definitely
one
id
like
to
revisit
in
the
future
assuming
its
available
drinkability
this
beer
holds
up
as
a
session
drink
i
could
probably
quaff
quite
a
few
of
these
without
getting
bored
of
it
kudos
d
easily
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
ever
had
admittedly
a
style
i
do
not
always
care
for
but
elysian
did
very
well
with
this
one
a
highly
rated
pumpkin
ale
that
is
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
overall
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
definitely
top
5
in
my
book
overall
i
want
to
love
pumpkin
beers
i
love
all
pumpkin
flavored
pies
cakes
coffee
ect
i
have
yet
to
find
a
beer
that
captures
the
real
pumpkin
pie
essence
does
such
a
beer
exsist
possibly
i
havent
found
it
yet
alot
of
times
the
nose
is
promising
only
to
be
a
let
down
once
tasted
this
beer
suffers
from
that
its
really
not
a
good
pumpkin
beer
at
all
great
timing
to
find
this
in
the
bc
government
store
as
it
really
tastes
like
a
spicy
winter
warmer
pours
an
orange
dark
brown
colour
and
a
spicy
malty
nose
the
beer
offers
a
well
rounded
mouthfeel
that
combines
the
spice
and
pumpkin
with
a
decently
hopped
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
malt
to
back
it
up
good
finish
that
maintains
the
drinkability
right
up
to
the
end
good
carbonation
nice
seasonal
d
hands
down
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
i
could
drink
this
year
round
a
session
pumpkin
beer
props
to
elysian
dm
crisp
and
filling
with
great
flavors
that
dont
ruin
your
palate
it
gives
you
a
great
warming
sensation
beer
is
light
in
body
and
a
little
sweet
the
spices
come
through
but
the
pumpkin
doesnt
take
center
state
here
drinkability
is
ok
better
if
you
like
nutmeg
and
allspice
but
im
not
really
feeling
this
one
all
that
much
pours
an
orange
copper
color
with
a
bit
of
haze
smell
brings
loads
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
clove
a
bit
of
roasted
pumpkin
the
taste
layers
on
the
spice
even
more
a
bit
of
toasted
bread
as
well
feel
is
strange
as
the
my
entire
palate
is
overcome
with
pumpkin
spices
drinks
okay
but
a
bit
lopsided
in
balance
overall
a
top
notch
pumpkin
ale
here
its
subtle
in
its
spiciness
while
showcasing
the
pumpkin
and
malts
as
a
good
pumpkin
ale
should
very
drinkable
and
one
of
the
few
pumpkin
ale
that
i
could
have
more
than
12
of
d
i
normally
dont
like
fruit
or
veggies
or
really
anything
extra
in
my
beer
but
this
is
very
tasty
perfect
fall
beer
one
of
the
top
6
best
pumpkin
brews
ive
had
elysian
can
make
a
good
pumpkin
brew
the
great
pumpkin
and
dark
o
the
moon
are
both
superior
but
this
one
is
still
great
and
more
accessible
and
probably
appeals
to
more
people
i
am
impressed
a
very
drinkable
brew
tasty
as
all
hell
and
one
i
wish
i
had
a
keg
of
d
pretty
easy
drinker
im
still
pretty
new
to
pumpkin
ales
but
this
one
definitely
seems
to
be
a
good
one
thanks
again
evan
i
know
that
there
is
some
hate
on
the
pumpkin
beer
but
anyone
who
is
into
pumpkin
beer
like
i
myself
am
will
find
this
as
the
quintessential
pumpkin
beer
take
that
pumking
those
who
dont
think
theyre
fans
should
reconsider
with
this
wonderful
iteration
on
the
style
nicely
complex
and
drinkable
but
probably
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
overall
this
beer
is
quite
enjoyable
to
drink
despite
the
presence
of
such
strong
and
unique
flavors
the
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
are
very
up
front
not
overbearing
and
very
balanced
i
found
this
brew
quite
drinkable
and
would
have
it
again
d
its
a
touch
sweet
but
not
a
strong
sugary
sweet
so
the
22
is
a
nice
treat
and
a
good
selection
for
tasting
pumpkin
brews
this
season
sure
cant
say
that
about
some
cough
buffalo
cough
bill
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
complex
pumpkin
ales
weve
had
to
date
and
there
is
a
bonus
in
its
drinkability
as
most
of
the
style
are
good
for
ony
one
serving
sip
after
sip
night

this
beer

pumpkins
are
one
of
my
favorite
things
in
this
world
they
make
amazing
pies
ravioli
and
above
all
else
beers
this
smelled
like
a
pumpkin
pie
i
swear
they
brewed
it
with
cinnamon
this
was
very
light
with
pumpkin
in
the
after
taste
i
enjoyed
it
though
it
may
have
been
to
light
this
was
a
nice

spices
i
would
put
this
as
3
for
me
in
terms
of
pumpkin
ales
behind
southern
tiers
pumking
and
weyerbachers
imperial
pumpkin
heady
company
indeed
dvery
wellbalanced
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
it
is
definitely
a
fall
beer
d
very
good
beer
i
love
pumpkins
a
lot
and
this
is
the
best
ive
had
other
than
southern
tier
pumking
i
love
pumpkin
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
dark
orange
color
strong
and
sweet
aroma
of
spices
and
cinnamon
taste
is
very
pumpkiney
with
lots
of
spice
and
hoppy
flavor
one
of
the
more
complex
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
the
beer
was
a
little
over
carbonated
for
me
not
very
smooth
or
warm
feeling
a
little
sharp
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
and
would
get
more
for
the
price
i
payed
for
sure
pours
a
dark
orange
to
amber
with
around
an
inch
of
head
the
color
of
butternut
squash
decent
retention
and
lacing
displayed
smells
of
baked
spiced
pumpkin
candied
ginger
and
nutmeg
for
among
the
absolute
best
pumpkin
beer
scents
on
the
market
tastes
of
rich
pumpkin
goodness
with
a
backing
of
gingerbread
and
a
harmonious
mixture
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
id
have
to
say
this
is
in
the
running
for
top
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
in
the
realm
of
similar
beers
the
only
one
definitely
better
for
me
is
barrel
aged
autumn
maple
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
medium
level
of
carbonation
highly
recommended
best
pumpkin
beer
out
west
does
not
meet
expectations
had
better
and
definitely
had
worse
d
spice
was
pretty
heavy
not
as
pumpkiny
as
many
it
was
a
nice
change
d
the
spice
could
be
a
bit
cloying
but
its
a
very
good
pumpkin
i
wouldnt
pass
up
if
given
the
opportunity
to
have
again
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
this
year
definately
worth
another
visit
would
like
to
try
again
next
year
to
make
sure
i
didnt
have
a
bad
bottle
this
one
scores
high
in
the
areas
that
dont
matter
but
misses
where
it
counts
in
my
opinion
any
assertion
that
this
could
overthrow
pumpking
is
just
way
off
base
overall
it
sounded
and
smelled
so
good
just
didnt
taste
good
to
me
i
like
pumpkin
beers
but
this
was
a
bit
off
vegetal
and
metallic
drinkability
the
best
new
pumpkin
beer
of
the
season
so
far
better
than
pumking
which
had
an
off
year
imo
at
any
rate
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
huge
thanks
to
matt
for
recommending
this
one
d
went
down
really
easily
and
i
brought
a
bottle
home
to
share
nice
stuff
i
didnt
share
any
though
hv
d
this
was
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
although
not
enough
to
dethrone
the
pumking
from
that
status
heavily
spiced
but
pretty
good
for
the
style
good
drinkability
d
i
split
the
bomber
and
am
glad
that
i
did
on
tap
at
city
beer
in
sf
cloudy
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
aroma
is
decent
with
good
pumpkin
spices
pumpkin
and
sweet
malt
flavor
is
not
bad
but
a
little
harsh
lots
of
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
stand
out
also
some
pumpkin
and
caramel
and
roasted
malt
could
use
a
little
better
malt
balance
but
its
still
better
than
most
pumpkin
ales
a
little
astringent
on
the
palate
with
medium
body
and
some
spicy
zing
above
average
overall
drinkability
decent
d
per
style
this
was
a
very
easy
drinking
pumpkin
that
didnt
go
overkill
on
the
spices
but
instead
opted
for
a
dry
homegrown
nature
good
drinkability
as
well
good
enjoyability
with
a
great
dry
toasted
nature
that
would
fair
perfect
around
a
campfire
on
a
chilly
october
evening
you
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
a
bomber
is
spot
on
without
being
overwhelmed
spice
wise
a
solid
recommend
per
style
nothing
against
elysian
but
their
two
offerings
i
have
tried
this
and
the
jasmine
ipa
have
been
a
little
too
subtle
for
me
almost
watered
down
probably
just
me
as
i
have
had
friends
who
really
enjoy
elysian
maybe
its
the
coast
to
coast
trip
d
overall
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
although
the
aroma
got
my
hopes
way
up
and
it
just
fell
a
little
bit
short
in
the
actual
flavor
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
definitely
well
done
its
just
missing
a
little
something
that
could
make
this
one
great
i
feel
like
a
bit
more
spice
in
the
flavor
to
round
it
out
might
have
made
it
that
much
better
for
me
it
might
be
worth
noting
that
this
was
contract
brewed
at
new
belgium
not
sure
if
theres
any
difference
between
this
batch
and
the
ones
brewed
in
seattle
d
interesting
beer
a
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
and
something
off
the
radar
pumpkin
ales
are
very
hit
or
miss
and
this
is
a
hit
lighter
style
being
just
under
6
and
lets
the
spices
do
most
of
the
talking
here
could
do
2
330s
easily
one
750
is
solid
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
but
darn
good
and
by
far
one
of
the
best
smelling
d
a
stellar
pumpkin
ale
that
in
my
opinion
should
be
the
one
that
all
others
are
measured
by
terrific
in
all
facets
it
truly
leaves
you
wanting
more
sip
after
sip
da
very
drinkable
dark
ale
its
not
an
overpowering
beer
but
has
plenty
of
spice
and
flavor
overall
a
very
nicely
brewed
pumpkin
ale
d
paired
with
some
thanksgiving
food
this
could
be
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
will
be
picking
up
more
of
this
through
thanksgiving
if
its
available
till
then
darker
orange
with
hints
of
copper
decent
white
head
and
ok
lacing
smell
is
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
like
nutmeg
clove
and
cinamon
with
a
little
pumpkin
puree
thing
going
on
tast
is
very
good
as
close
to
pumpkin
pie
as
i
have
had
outside
of
a
st
pumking
good
body
carbonation
does
not
get
in
the
way
creamy
without
being
sticky
or
heavy
very
good
pumpkin
beer
one
of
the
best
d
pumpkin
beers
are
a
style
im
slowly
getting
into
overall
this
seems
a
nice
example
d
one
fantastic
beer
for
the
foliage
season
it
resembles
everything
that
goes
with
the
season
kudos
to
the
brewmaster
not
your
typical
pumpkin
ale
a
good
bit
of
dryness
and
hops
strong
nose
of
ginger
and
nutmeg
deep
amber
brown
body
with
thick
off
white
head
pumpkin
flavor
comes
through
on
the
finish
but
still
feels
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
6un
because
its
different
from
the
standard
pumpkin
brew
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
d
this
does
not
taste
like
any
average
pumpkin
ale
very
spiced
and
has
good
drinkability
but
not
something
i
would
want
more
than
a
bomber
of
splitting
this
seemed
just
right
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
poured
into
a
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
copper
color
with
about
a
finger
of
quickly
fading
rust
colored
foam
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
roasted
pumpkin
allspice
nutmeg
ginger
brown
sugar
caramel
cinnamon
toasted
biscuits
thin
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
lingering
spiciness
worth
a
try
if
you
dig
pumpkin
ales
very
spicy
up
front
with
a
lot
of
cloves
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
with
a
medium
creamy
malt
backbone
and
some
nice
pumpkin
pie
spice
nutmeg
subtle
hops
and
ginger
in
the
dry
finish
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
pretty
much
undetectable
this
beer
is
slightly
watered
down
with
a
lot
of
the
pumpkin
pie
notes
coming
through
in
the
aftertaste
md
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
the
tastes
just
dont
line
up
for
me
which
brings
the
drinkability
down
a
notch
mouthfeel
is
well
balanced
for
the
beer
not
too
fizzy
but
smooth
and
semifull
well
done
elysian
i
wish
i
could
always
find
excellent
beer
at
clearance
prices
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
beer
by
the
next
fall
really
nice
go
for
the
style
probably
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
real
pumpkin
flavor
makes
this
a
more
successful
example
of
the
style
than
is
ordinarily
seen
in
our
region
a
terrific
fall
seasonal
and
elysian
was
still
selling
bombers
for
just
three
bucks
at
their
brewpub
as
of
midfebruary
medium
body
mediumlow
co2
balanced
very
enjoyable
pours
a
clear
amber
a
little
rough
looking
some
orange
hues
thick
off
white
head
forms
drops
some
decent
lacing
good
retention
and
settles
to
a
thin
collar
smell
is
neat
lots
of
spicing
cloves
and
cinnamon
nutmeg
rich
pumpkin
aroma
caramel
and
honey
some
toasty
pumpkin
seeds
biscuit
corn
syrup
smells
pretty
nice
taste
is
very
malty
pumpkin
caramel
honey
sweetness
very
biscuity
light
toast
slight
lemony
sourness
and
the
spices
come
through
in
the
finish
light
spicy
bitterness
and
big
biscuit
flavour
nice
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
spices
are
there
but
not
too
much
maybe
because
its
an
older
bottle
a
pretty
nice
pumpkin
ale
i
like
i
dont
know
what
to
say
about
this
pumpkin
ale
it
had
the
taste
of
pumpkin
in
it
but
it
was
holding
back
the
spices
for
some
reason
i
guess
the
baked
pumpkin
was
scared
that
the
spices
would
over
run
the
taste
so
that
it
beat
the
spices
down
overall
its
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
its
just
not
my
favorite
one
and
its
definitely
not
my
favorite
beer
from
elysian
purchased
liquid
solutions
appearance
is
a
hazy
orangecopper
color
with
about
a
2
finger
head
poured
into
a
pint
glass
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
real
pumpkin
not
pumpkin
spice
as
this
beer
warms
up
the
pumpkin
comes
to
the
front
with
just
a
hint
of
nutmeg
and
malt
i
find
most
pumpkin
ales
to
be
overly
spiced
this
one
is
right
on
the
money
with
the
pumpkin
flavor
mouthfeel
i
thought
was
a
bit
thin
but
for
a
beer
6
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
else
overall
i
could
drink
this
over
and
over
again
very
easy
to
put
down
a
couple
of
pints
appearance
is
a
hazy
orange
amber
with
a
thick
head
that
stays
put
leaving
a
nice
lace
smell
of
sweet
malt
and
pumpkin
spice
taste
is
well
rounded
with
pumpkin
and
spice
leaving
a
nice
light
spicy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
for
me
in
this
beer
with
low
carbonation
smooth
and
creamy
making
for
an
easy
drink
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
and
one
ill
keep
ordering
thanks
cannabanaceae
for
the
opportunity
very
fragrant
and
pumkinlike
this
is
seethrough
yellow
body
with
lots
of
lace
the
carbonation
is
above
average
the
taste
is
primarily
nutmeg
and
peppery
with
less
clove
and
ginger
and
so
more
enjoyable
to
me
was
great
on
winter
night
average

overall
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
its
like
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
drinkability
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
tasting
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
it
goes
down
easy
and
several
pints
could
be
quaffed
in
a
session
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
a
cloudy
almost
pumpkin
orange
with
a
decent
one
inch
head
the
smell
wasnt
as
impressive
reminded
me
of
a
cheap
big
brewery
lager
with
some
spices
thrown
on
top
but
to
my
surprise
this
turned
out
to
be
on
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
not
too
crazy
or
overwhelming
with
the
spices
which
tends
to
be
the
case
more
often
then
not
and
you
could
actually
taste
some
pumpkin
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
but
when
the
season
comes
and
youre
looking
for
a
pumpkin
brew
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
with
was
just
a
solid
allaround
pumpkin
ale
with
well
rounded
flavors
that
really
in
popped
in
the
mouth
at
times
this
was
definitely
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
had
in
the
bottle
taste
is
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
light
sweet
caramel
malts
the
raw
pumpkin
is
noted
also
far
too
light
and
watery
for
my
taste
overcarbonated
fizzy
and
sodalike
in
the
mouth
not
one
ill
purchase
a
second
time
notes
no
complaints
here
as
it
was
not
only
well
balancedbut
had
very
good
drinkability
drinks
okay
was
hoping
for
more
flavor
malt
depth
from
these
guys
this
is
still
a
style
with
more
misses
than
hits
for
me
this
is
one
of
my
goto
pumpkin
beers
and
it
rarely
dissapoints
its
not
overwhelmingly
pumpkin
pie
spiced
nor
is
it
too
vegetable
and
squashy
its
smooth
malty
and
creamy
definitely
worth
trying
if
pumpkin
beers
are
at
all
of
interest
to
you
overall
an
okay
beer
i
really
dont
care
for
the
taste
of
the
pumpkin
brews
that
come
out
in
the
fall
but
this
one
is
better
than
most
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
as
the
spices
are
there
but
not
overwhelming
with
a
nice
balance
to
it
d
good
for
one
the
overwhelming
spice
flavor
started
to
grate
on
me
by
the
last
sip
aroma
of
light
spicing
but
lacking
a
pumpkin
head
was
big
low
carbonation
appears
a
standard
brown
in
low
bar
lighting
taste
was
smooth
and
some
pumpkin
was
definitely
there
it
was
a
lot
lighter
than
i
expected
leaving
me
disappointed
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
bisquity
pumpkin
scent
along
with
an
array
of
spices
cinnamon
nutmeg
etc
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
solid
grist
of
pale
crystal
and
bisquit
malts
along
with
a
large
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
its
a
smooth
drinking
beer
with
little
to
no
pumpkin
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
very
well
done
pumpkin
beer
some
of
these
are
too
malty
some
are
too
spicey
some
are
really
dry
and
pumpkin
filled
this
is
a
well
rounded
highly
drinkable
beer
the
taste
at
times
reminds
me
of
ginger
bread
though
the
pumpkin
is
undoubtedly
there
not
much
in
the
way
of
carbonation
smooth
and
slick
mouthfeel
with
a
watery
body
the
body
is
a
real
turn
off
for
me
i
like
my
pumpkin
ales
heartier
than
this
one
there
is
also
a
strange
and
somewhat
awkward
offdry
quality
on
the
finish
d
a
nice
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
unfortunately
the
strong
ginger
taste
got
to
me
later
on
would
have
been
nicer
if
the
ginger
spices
were
calmer
allowing
the
other
tastes
and
spices
to
come
through
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
finished
the
bomber
in
5
minutes
its
that
drinkable
however
i
milked
it
a
bit
since
this
is
the
only
bottle
i
have
of
this
excellent
pumpkin
ale
i
hear
elysian
are
coming
into
the
southland
soon
this
beer
made
a
great
first
impression
definitely
falls
into
the
traditional
pumpkin
ale
category
in
that
it
resembles
what
i
imagine
the
real
thing
back
in
colonial
days
must
have
tasted
like
when
they
really
had
to
substitute
squash
for
grain
for
my
money
though
i
prefer
the
updated
non
scarcity
based
approach
of
for
instance
smuttynose
that
provides
a
firm
pale
ale
stage
on
which
the
spice
and
vegetable
can
perform
still
an
accomplished
beer
pours
a
beautiful

is

the
better

had
this

be
one

the
more
drinkable

toasted
grain
and
a
touch
of
floral
hops
medium
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
malty
and
smooth
with
a
crisp
semidry
finish
a
good
pumpkin
ale
low
in
abv
and
easy
to
drink
but
the
pumpkin
and
other
spices
are
a
little
masked
by
the
heavy
nutmeg
d
i
ordered
this
beer
off
the
internet
i
wish
it
was
availible
around
here
this
was
very
good
i
could
open
up
another
bottle
right
now
d
i
could
drink
this
one
over
and
over
i
want
to
pick
up
another
bottle
for
sure
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
this
is
a
good
one
d
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
not
near
the
top
for
me
but
better
than
my
previous
drain
pours
this
evening
d
a
tasty
easy
drinking
pumpkin
ale
overall
a
good
pumpkin
ale
but
i
would
much
rather
drink
a
few
of
the
locals
here
there
is
something
about
bottled
pumpkin
ales
that
just
dont
do
the
trick
for
me
unless
of
course
the
pumpkin
is
mixed
in
with
an
imperial
chocolate
porter
haha
still
a
good
sessionable
fall
brew
this
beer
is
much
better
on
tap
but
even
then
it
cant
touch
the
quality
of
their
great
pumpkin
try
some
highly
recommended
if
you
are
a
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
d
this
beer
is
pretty
tasty
but
the
flavors
are
not
something
i
want
to
taking
on
all
night
long
still
a
good
beer
and
not
bad
to
share
a
bomber
with
buddy
or
lady
pretty
good
stuff
pours
copper
with
a
rich
cream
head
good
retention
and
a
nicely
laced
glass
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
along
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
spicemostly
clove
but
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
flavor
is
rich
with
pumkin
backed
by
spices
with
some
nuttiness
in
the
middle
malts
kick
inbut
not
quite
enough
a
slight
balance
of
hop
spice
in
the
end
but
not
a
bite
the
abv
is
just
over
6
percent
but
the
alcohol
warmth
is
immediate
and
becomes
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
pumpkin
flavors
become
more
pronounced
with
warmth
as
well
this
beer
is
good
but
slightly
watery
in
the
mouth
as
it
seems
to
be
in
need
of
more
malt
its
the
alcohol
that
really
gets
me
on
this
one
its
not
something
i
can
drink
more
than
one
of
because
its
so
warm
otherwise
i
did
enjoy
it
and
found
it
to
be
better
than
other
pumpkin
brews

is
purely
of
a

mostly
about
the
pumpkin
and
less
about
the
associated

more
quality
brew
from
the
folks
at
elysian
understated
in
the
approach
this
pumpkin

offering
does
not
over
do
it
spicepumpkin
flavor
wise
nice
fall
seasonal
moderate
sweetness
moderate
hops
more
pumpkin
essence
in
the
finish
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
the
style
overall
very
tasty
and
1
of
the
best
ive
had
in
2008
d
overall
i
found
this
to
be
very
drinkable
most
likely
will
jump
into
a
few
more
before
the
end
of
the
fall
season
at
the
very
least
i
think
having
this
closer
to
room
temperature
is
worth
a
try
the
aroma
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
smelled
and
the
taste
was
quality
just
a
little
more
body
and
a
little
more
pumpkin
taste
and
this
would
have
been
perfect
the
actual
pumpkin
flavor
seems
stronger
and
doesnt
seem
to
have
a
heavy
nutmeg
presence
the
ale
is
still
quite
dry
and
the
malt
is
perfect
for
a
pumpkin
ale
though
very
carbonated
boosting
up
the
score
a
bit
d
pretty
good
for
a
seasonal
local
pumpkin
ale
this
is
pretty
good
but
these
speciality
flavored
beers
are
only
good
in
small
doses
the
body
is
moderate
to
light
definitely
would
have
liked
more
body
on
this
one
nice
pumpkin
finish
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
but
would
have
liked
more
pumpkin
and
less
spice
this
might
have
been
fixed
by
just
adding
more
body
to
it
though
d
drinks
easy
and
goes
well
with
hearty
foods
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
offwhite
head
some
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
very
nice
tones
of
cinimmon
pumpkin
nutmeg
with
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
very
nice
touch
of
the
spicys
and
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
one
recommended
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
watery
on
this
one
which
maybe
is
good
since
i
have
to
drink
22
oz
of
it
i
think
for
drinkability
factor
if
it
were
a
bit
thicker
and
bottled
in
12
oz
bottles
it
would
be
nicer
or
thicker
in
22
oz
bottles
you
could
pass
around
after
thanksgiving
dinner
instead
of
pie
i
just
wish
it
came
in
a
12oz
bottle
no
other
beer
comes
to
mind
that
i
so
thoroughly
enjoy
yet
so
quickly
am
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
im
sticking
a
cork
in
this
bottle
and
finishing
it
tomorrow
half
a
bottle
satisfied
my
pumpkin
fix
just
fine
drinkability
pretty
decent
the
beer
improves
quite
a
bit
upon
warming
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
still
not
a
style
i
really
love
aside
from
ichabod
but
nonetheless
pretty
good
had

poured
amber
with
almost
no

and
lightly

smells
of
vanilla
nutmeg
orange
and
fresh
pumpkin
taste
also
has
evidence
of
real

being
used
nice
to
find
some
creamy
slightly
slick
real
pumpkin
flavors
instead
of
just
extracts
and
pie

light
spice
on

as
well
as
a

a

thin
and
slightly

but
still
nice
again
very
nicely
balanced
drinks
like
a
full
flavored
english
brown
with
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
graham
crackers
added
a
very
good
approach
to
the
style
get
the
base
right
than
add
the
spice
creamy
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
highly
drinkable
toffee
laden
pumpkin
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
sampled
poured
beuatifully
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
small
white
head
nose
is
big
pumpkin
and
spices
right
away
taste
carried
a
strong
hint
of
cinnnamon
nutmeg
and
allspice
but
the
pumpkin
is
king
and
lots
of
it
mouthfeel
is
sweet
and
warming
damn
good
brew
not
a
bad
seasonal
beer
and
a
big
improvement
over
the
only
other
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
shipyard
this
might
be
a
decent
beer
to
crack
open
after
a
meal
but
if
youre
having
pumpkin
pie
for
dessert
it
might
be
overkill
im
not
sure
id
want
to
drink
several
of
these
at
a
sitting
still
i
enjoyed
it
as
a
stand
alone
beer
after
lunch
while
watching
football
this
was
the
third
beer
that
my
wife
brought
back
for
me
from
seattle
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
to
crack
it
open
on
halloween
poured
it
into
pint
glasses
had
the
typical
look
and
smell
of
pumpkin
ales
did
not
have
a
lot
of
carbonation
a
bit
of
a
let
down
so
not
much
head
had
a
nice
taste
but
differed
from
most
other
brands
as
the
taste
was
more
pumpkin
than
spice
the
more
subtle
flavor
made
this
beer
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
perhaps
the
greatest
pumpkin
ale
yet
jurys
out
on
that
of
course
but
so
far
its
my
1
choice
addendum
southern
tiers
pumking
now
reigns
but
night
owl
is
still
wonderful
d
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
right
now
other
than
this
time
of
the
year
i
dont
think
i
could
see
myself
drinking
pumpkin
ales
though
d
not
too
heavily
spiced
wellbalanced
between
malty
and
earthyhoppy
traits
and
with
some
heavier
bitter
backing
notes
all
in
all
an
ale
ill
look
forward
to
year
after
year
certainly
recommended
although
with
a
caveat
this
is
not
for
everyone
will
be
way
too
tart
and
earthy
for
the
spicysweet
pumpkin
ale
lover
the
most
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
two
pints
in
this
sitting
was
no
problem
at
all
very
apropos
for
fall
a
great
seasonal
for
sure
the
night
owl
came
in
a
22oz
with
no
freshness
date
it
poured
a
hazy
dark
orange
to
amber
color
it
left
some
nice
sea
foam
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
which
stayed
put
as
you
drank
it
down
the
smell
was
aromatic
of
more
of
pumpkin
rather
than
spices
which
i
have
seen
in
a
number
of
pumpkin
ales
it
seemed
to
be
fairly
simple
the
taste
was
good
and
smooth
and
a
tiny
tiny
tiny
bit
hoppy
it
seemed
to
be
a
low
carbonated
and
thin
in
the
mouth
overall
should
i
stay
true
to
the
rating
system
i
will
try
this
beer
for
9
years
straight
and
see
how
it
comes
out
each
fall
pours
a
brightly
glowing
orangeamber
color
with
an
offwhite
head
featuring
tightly
compacted
bubbles
the
foam
reduces
quickly
leaving
minimal
lacing
in
a
beer
clean
glass
the
aroma
is
very
nice
a
lot
of
pumpkin
and
spices
such
as
clove
nutmeg
and
maybe
a
little
cinnamon
it
really
just
smells
a
lot
like
pumpkin
pie
which
is
very
nice
the
taste
closely
matches
the
aroma
loaded
with
pumpkin
and
spices
and
theres
also
a
black
tealike
aftertaste
that
im
not
sure
what
to
think
of
the
alcohol
is
nearly
imperceptible
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
with
very
little
carbonation
this
is
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
to
date
palate
is
lightly
sweet
up
front
with
the
pumpkin
emerging
to
provide
some
depth
of
flavor
the
spices
come
through
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
lending
a
mild
herby
bitterness
on
the
finish
at
the
same
time
though
this
beer
is
much
milder
on
the
spices
than
most
pumpkin
ales
quite
a
favorable
character
in
my
eye
body
is
smooth
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
overall
a
quite
nice
pumpkin
ale
that
favors
real
pumpkin
flavor
instead
of
a
large
amount
of
pie
spice
drinkability
everything
leading
up
to
the
actual
taste
is
amazing
but
than
it
goes
slighty
downhill
still
better
than
the
other
2
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tried
cheers
another
solid
offering
from
the
folks
at
elysian
and
another
big
thanks
to
cvschaller
for
the
many
samples
this
was
a
hoot
tasty
and
very
nice
aroma
i
tasted
a
little
more
alcohol
in
this
years
version
it
seemed
nutmeg
a
little
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
spice
accompanied
by
a
warming
alcohol
taste
ill
have
to
try
it
on
tap
for
comparison
but
the
bottle
is
definately
worth
a
grab
i
was
surprised
to
come
across
this
so
early
surprised
and
very
happy
body
is
gorgeous
orange
and
head
is
thick
and
creamy
nose
is
awash
in
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
oh
yes
lots
of
pumpkin
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
additions
of
buttery
notes
and
vanilla
man
this
is
the
beer
when
it
comes
to
pumpkin
ales
ive
never
had
one
that
did
it
better
i
need
to
buy
lots
of
this
thanks
to
mike
aka
garagekegger
for
sharing
his
bomber
tonightvery
nice
pumpkin
colored
deep
somewhat
hazy
pour
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
left
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
behind
as
it
settled
very
spicey
aromas
cinnamon
and
clove
really
stick
out
in
the
aromas
more
in
the
lines
of
apple
pie
but
still
appetizing
seemed
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
department
and
a
little
fizzy
but
the
flavors
were
nice
not
overly
sweet
the
cinnamon
and
clove
are
there
there
is
a
decent
pumpkin
bite
in
there
but
the
spice
outweighs
it
not
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
to
be
had
flavorful
if
not
a
bit
thin
even
though
the
aroma
is
beyond
amazing
i
still
have
to
give
the
slight
nod
to
smuttynoses
version
as
the
absolute
best
im
amazed
at
the
quality
of
this
beer
and
im
becoming
more
so
with
every
mouthful
maybe
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
since
i
love
elysians
ipa
and
esb
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
and
you
have
the
chance
to
obtain
night
owl
you
wont
be
sorry
trust
me
my
first
foray
into
the
fractured
margin
of
the
world
of
pumpkin
ales
and
im
just
a
bit
disappointed
elysians
night
owl
pours
a
dark
deep
orange
getting
you
in
the
mood
for
big
pumpkin
taste
when
i
take
a
deep
whiff
of
this
brew
it
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
a
kitchen
when
a
pumpkin
pie
is
in
the
oven
the
taste
doesnt
really
overwhelm
me
though
i
was
expecting
a
richer
butterier
concoction
but
this
tastes
like
a
pale
ale
with
pumpkin
spices
added
full
bodied
but
remarkably
refreshing
drinkability

this
is
a
good
solid
very
malty
ale
with
a
bit
of
pacnw
leafy
bitterness
to
boot
a
beautiful
finish
as
the
beer
warms
nice
dark
amber
color
medium
lightcolored
head
delicate
lacing
on
the
glass
very
strong
caramel
and
pumpkin
smell
overall
the
presentation
is
great
however
the
taste
falls
somewhat
short
it
was
very
sweet
it
almost
tasted
like
a
pumpkin
cider
rather
than
a
beer
if
you
want
a
nice
beer
for
dessert
this
could
be
good
but
otherwise
id
recommend
getting
something
else

the
best
cat
ever
we
will
always
miss
you
this
seasonal
pumpkin
ale
pours
a
hazy
mahogany
in
color
with
about
a
halffinger
offwhite
foamy
head
a
good
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
close
to
ringlike
even
sediment
is
seen
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
after
the
pour
the
aroma
is
like
a
fresh
pumpkin
pie
fantastic
even
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
their
are
the
perfect
amount
of
spices
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
even
a
hint
of
clove
in
the
mix
really
smooth
and
goes
down
so
easy
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
on
the
market
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
love
this
one
but
i
do
remembered
how
good
it
was
from
back
in
2012
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
beers
out
there
too
heavy
on
the
spices
or
maybe
a
spice
has
raisiny
flavor
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
aroma
is
pie
crust
spicescinnamon
slight
mustiness
and
a
hint
of
pumpkin
the
flavor
is
spicescinnamon
breadpie
crust
a
hint
of
fruit
and
a
tart
finish
o
this
is
really
a
model
pumpkin
beer
that
others
should
aspire
to
full
rich
pumpkin
flavor
but
balanced
and
very
drinkable

pumpkin
of

for
me
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
four
pack
a
mistake
i
wont
make
next
year
well
done
poured
a
cloudy
amber
hue
with
a
nice
glow
around
the
edges
aromas
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
apple
apple
pie
and
some
pumpkin
tasted
the
pumpkin
definitely
not
a
spicy
mess
very
delicate
cinnamon
and
spice
could
use
a
bit
more
hop
bitterness
in
my
opinion
for
balance
but
very
good
smooth
medium
body
and
mouthfeel
with
very
little
aftertaste
overall
this
was
outstanding
i
can
see
why
it
won
a
blind
pumpkin
tasting
in
my
bottleshop
2
years
running
o
one
mans
pumpkin
ale
is
not
another
mans
pumpkin
ale
this
is
a
great
beverage
just
a
bit
stronger
than
my
holy
grail
of
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
with
whipped
cream
this
is
a
really
impressive
pumpkin
ale
i
like
the
way
the
pumpkingourd
flavor
combines
with
the
spicing
this
is
not
a
spice
bomb
but
it
add
a
nice
touch
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
most
prevalent
really
like
the
aroma
and
flavor
only
slight
knock
would
be
it
could
use
a
bit
fuller
body
for
7

finishes
a
little
thin
rather
than
rounded
but
i
am
splitting
hairs
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
but
its
definitely
better
than
ten
pumpkin
beers
ive
tried
in
the
past
month
outstanding
brew
tough
to
find
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
but
i
was
able
to
find
a
few
4
packs
so
that
i
could
give
this
one
a
try
boy
did
it
not
disappoint
so
far
this
one
has
been
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
that
i
have
had
so
far
this
year
just
a
tad
better
than
the
dog
fish
head
punkin
great
flavor
spices
are
perfectly
blended
and
it
is
one
smooth
brew
i
highly
recommend
you
gove
this
one
a
try
it
is
pure
bliss
pumpkin
pie
in
a
bottle
poured
this
at
a
perfect
temperature
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
promptly
disappeared
no
lace
and
a
clear
brown
color
aroma
is
spicy
pumpkin
pie
and
more
bold
than
the
flavor
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
where
the
flavors
are
not
so
overpowering
there
is
some
balance
malts
can
be
tasted
still
not
one
of
my
favorite
kinds
of
beers
but
this
isnt
bad
good
body
decent
finish
with
a
very
slight
hint
of
alcohol
o
this
is
the
opposite
of
new
glarus
pumpkin
pie
lust
this
is
all
spices
all
the
way
its
very
interesting
to
see
how
the
two
contrast
not
sure
which
one
im
more
impressed
with
but
this
is
pretty
impressively
spiceforward
if
thats
your
thing
i
certainly
recommend
this
one
4
great
desert
beer
one
of
my
top
3
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
to
date
closest
to
pumkin
pie
that
your
going
to
get
sweet
and
delicious
highly
recommend
a
good
pumpkin
a
good
gimmick
beer
nothing
to
take
seriously
here
my
peeps
overall
absolutely
a
pleasure
and
delight
already
one
of
my
top
pumpkin
beers
ever
had
seriously
when
you
want
dessert
after
dinner
this
is
it
salud
excellent
ale
true
to
its
title
fitting
for
a
great
fall
beverage
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
murky
orangecopper
color
with
a
small
head
that
disappates
very
quickly
aroma
consists
of
the
typical
pumpkin
pie
spices
the
flavor
is
not
bad
but
the
spices
are
very
prominent
mouthfeel
is
way
too
thin
and
watery
very
underwhelming
pumpkin
beer
there
are
many
better
versions
out
there
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
ever
had
pours
a
cloudy
dark
orange
with
a
quickly
fading
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
pumpkin
pie
spices
nutmeg
some
cinnamon
notes
taste
is
sweet
pumpkin
spices
nutmeg
with
some
malt
and
mild
hops
bitterness
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
has
sweet
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
nutmeg
flavor
with
some
moderate
hops
bitterness
on
the
end
for
balance
overall
has
some
back
bone
and
flavor
for
a
pumpkin
ale
a
good
brew
even
with
schlafly
and
ahead
of
pumking
in
a
blind
taste
test
of
the
three
i
would
have
rated
this
higher
but
im
not
a
super
fan
of
the
high
fruity
issued
beers
this
is
defiantly
a
pumpkin
beer
as
you
can
taste
the
pumpkin
and
spices
right
away
it
even
has
a
crust
bread
type
after
taste
that
makes
this
much
like
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
if
you
like
the
full
all
out
taste
of
pumpkin
pie
this
is
the
beer
for
you
must
have
been
something
wrong
with
this
one
or
i
didnt
get
the
beer
i
ordered
the
feel
is
brisk
a
biting
crispness
and
a
bit
of
zing
in
its
medium
body
as
such
its
not
entirely
smooth
but
its
pretty
clean
and
great
for
a
cool
autumn
day
i
love
pumpkin
pie
so
its
obvious
i
love
this
beer
no
sweet
but
well
balances
pumpkin
on
the
front
and
the
crust
on
the
back
a
little
too
much
cinnamon
cloudy
brownish
copper
the
nose
has
notes
of
both
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
there
is
a
potent
taste
of
fresh
pumpkin
with
a
blend
of
spices
that
are
pleasantly
present
but
do
not
overwhelm
the
taste
of
the
gourd
there
is
no
sweetness
here
this
is
not
a
dessert
beer
this
is
meant
for
the
main
course
highly
recommended
to
those
who
do
not
like
sweet
overthetop
pumpkin
beers
if
you
like
pumpkin
pie
then
this
is
your
beer
nothing
but
spices
drink
this
alongside
any
quality
pumpkin
ale
and
youll
immediately
notice
the
utter
lack
of
any
pumpkin
in
this
beer
i
bought
an
entire
case
based
on
the
high
rating
highest
of
the
2030
pumpkins
my
distributor
had
i
feel
duped
and
have
a
very
rare
buyers
remorse
of
a
beer
purchase
so
i
have
plenty
to
trade
if
anyone
has
interest
in
doing
so
for
those
that
like
their
pumpales
spicy
this
is
a
good
choice
it
also
has
great
malt
interest
pours
a
brownish
orange
with
a
creamy
head
smells
like
fresh
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
unbelievably
pumpkin
for
a
beer
easily
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
tasted
i
didnt
try
this
but
you
could
probably
add
whip
cream
or
vanilla
ice
cream
for
a
great
beer
float
i
love
a
good
pumpkin
ale
id
go
as
far
as
saying
it
pretty
much
my
favorite
style
while
this
doesnt
dethrone
the
king
of
pumpkin
beers
pumpking
it
riding
on
its
coattails
its
patiently
waiting
its
for
its
turn
to
sit
in
the
iron
throne
additionally
if
i
want
to
get
my
hands
on
southern
tiers
nectar
of
the
gods
i
have
to
drive
4
hours
giving
whole
hog
a
hell
of
an
advantage
do
yourself
a
favor
and
snag
this
if
you
see
it
taste
like
straight
home
homemade
pie
hands
down
the
best
pumpkin
beer
i
ever
had
near
perfect
in
every
way
cant
wait
till
next
autumn
o
thanks
for
the
honor
andy
definitely
a
keeper
this
is
one
orange

the
fizzy
foamy

with

clarity

pumpkin

nose
was
more
sweet
than
spicy
and
i
was
put
in
mind
of
cinnamon
toast
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
very
pleasant
with
the
cinnamon
and
the
malt
especially
the
caramel
malt
interacting
beautifully
i
really
felt
like
it
was
liquid
cinnamon
toast
finish
was
semidry
with
the
spices
being
balanced
out
nicely
i
feel
renewed
in
my
attempt
to
review
such
beers
ymmv
this
beer
has
a
nice
brown
reddish
color
body
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
sweet
pumpkin
smell
and
spice
the
taste
is
simple
pumpkin
and
spice
its
like
a
liquid
pumpkin
pie
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
overall
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
much
thanks
to
dave
for
providing
the
bottle
he
wanted
to
share
a
pumpkin
ale
he
thought
i
would
like
after
i
wrote
that
perhaps
i
didnt
like
them
anymore
i
like
them
when
theyre
as
good
as
this
but
cant
see
having
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
overall
i
think
this
is
a
complete
miss
as
a
pumpkin
ale
in
dont
understand
the
high
ratings
for
this
brew
little
pumpkin
smell
or
taste
little
pumpkin
spice
smell
or
taste
this
brew
is
even
light
on
the
caramel
malts
there
are
much
better
pumpkin
ales
out
there
this
is
maybe
the
best
pumpkin
bier
ive
had
yet
its
deadon
for
pumpkin
pie
but
it
has
a
great
balance
of
pumpkin
and
spice
every
bottle
i
drink
i
just
think
jeez
i
need
to
buy
more
of
this
absolute
perfect
start
to
autumn
o
tasty
overall
an
excellent
pumpkin
ale
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
close
to
a
finger
of
deep
tan
not
dense
nor
airy
just
a
scattershot
of
larger
bubbles
boils
down
to
the
surface
at
a
steady
clip
the
lacing
is
not
that
sticky
but
certainly
better
than
most
in
the
category
not
cloudy
but
darn
close
to
opaque
liquid
sunset
red
up
close
more
a
mix
of
browns
and
oranges
further
away
few
bubbles
visible
the
nose
is
clean
and
direct
cinnamon
to
clove
spice
orange
peel
the
pumpkin
is
ripe
but
not
sweet
light
breadiness
without
it
being
pielike
touch
of
cocoa
powder
too
nothing
here
overdone
or
unnecessarily
flamboyant
mediumbodied
has
enough
prickle
from
the
carbonation
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
check
even
has
a
sort
of
tart
metallic
edge
at
times
otherwise
straight
up
fresh
pumpkin
with
cinnamon
nutmeg
spice
chocolate
and
vanilla
accents
less
citrus
here
mostly
orange
some
lemon
stays
balanced
and
the
flavors
cruise
at
a
steady
altitude
you
dont
get
worn
out
by
it
finishes
cleanly
yet
with
bite
easy
to
like
and
again
doesnt
try
too
hard
always
a
plus
in
my
book
o
i
think
this
surpasses
pumpking
as
my
new
favorite
pumpkin
beer
really
good
if
you
are
looking
for
something
that
is
forward
with
the
pumpkin
pie
spice
overall
i
have
been
waiting
for
several
years
to
try
this
beer
and
am
delighted
to
finally
have
tasted
this
the
munich
and
caramel
malts
really
make
a
difference
here
as
does
the
delicate
spicing
o
easily
my
favorite
of
this
season
so
far
really
reminds
me
of
a
rich
yet
slightly
sweet
pumpkin
pie
we
had
southern
tiers
pumking
along
side
this
and
i
would
choose
this
over
pumking
all
day
long
wanted
to
try
some
pumpkin
beers
since
its
starting
to
cool
down
in
texas
so
we
grabbed
this
at
the
local
liquor
store
in
a
mix
a
six
glad
we
did
this
beer
was
fantastic
great
pumpkin
spice
aroma
almost
like
thanksgiving
dinner
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
almost
like
homemade
pumpkin
puree
from
your
moms
pumpkin
pie
it
carries
this
taste
throughout
the
finish
went
back
to
the
store
to
grab
a
sixer
but
they
were
already
out
and
said
they
would
be
out
till
next
year
bummer
definitely
worth
a
try
great
thanks
to
st9647v3
for
this
autumn
treat
o
i
enjoy
pumpkin
beers
but
generally
only
knock
back
one
in
a
sitting
then
move
along
to
another
style
i
could
legitimately
see
myself
throwing
back
a
four
pack
of
this
without
much
regret
well
done
whole
hog
well
done
o
balance
it
the
key
with
pumpkin
beers
and
this
one
has
it
not
too
much
alcohol
nice
spice
level
that
keeps
the
pumpkin
noticeable
and
a
clean
aftertaste
o
very
tasty
beer
great
series
by
stevens
point
so
far
this
one
may
be
my
favorite
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
because
it
had
lots
of
pumpkins
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
but
it
wasnt
really
sweet
or
spicy
it
has
excellent
drinkability
served
in
a
chilled
tulip
glass
bright
amber
orange
moderately
cloudy
appearance
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
dominate
the
aroma
true
pumpkin
aroma
and
taste
clean
and
refreshing
balanced
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
aroma
and
taste
develop
in
35
minutes
smooth
no
sharp
edges
and
nothing
overwhelming
simply
a
very
pleasant
and
true
pumpkin
ale
that
i
would
recommend
highly
my
wife
dislikes
beer
with
a
passion
and
she
asked
for
more
after
her
first
taste
the
only
pumpkin
ale
i
have
liked
more
was
southern
tier
on
tap
in
a
tulip
glass
which
was
a
revelation
from
the
bottle
in
a
tulip
glass
whole
hog
has
a
slight
edge
with
its
balance
and
smooth
feel
o
liked
it
a
lot
just
like
the
balance
of
some
others
ive
tried
o
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
a
whole
lot
its
more
of
a
roasty
kind
of
pumpkin
brown
ale
but
its
not
the
worst
o
as
close
to
perfect
as
i
have
tasted
in
a
long
time
i
love
pumpkin
which
only
makes
this
beer
all
the
better
it
is
a
must
have
for
any
true
beer
fans
update
sep
22just
had
a
homemade
pumpkin
pie
from
my
wife
and
had
this
whole
hog
and
tastes
were
matched
this
now
goes
a
5
for
me
this
beer
is
outstanding
if
you
want
a
pumpkin
ale
that
actually
tastes
like
pumpkin
this
ale
is
for
you
the
only
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
that
compares
is
southern
tier
pumking
ale
which
is
much
more
expensive
i
have
tried
roughly
20
different
pumpkin
ales
and
this
one
is
2
overall
and
1
bang
for
my
buck
worth
every
bit
of
8
99
for
a
4
pack
wow
had
this
last
year
but
not
a
whole
one
so
i
could
not
review
it
i
got
a
case
this
year
it
is
amazing
pumking
used
to
be
my
pumpkin
beer
of
choice
this
takes
pumking
outside
and
kicks
it
in
the
balls
and
a
4
pack
cost
about
the
same
as
1
bomber
i
love
being
able
to
taste
the
crust
of
the
pie
in
the
beer
ya
i
know
some
people
think
of
point
as
a
faux
craft
brewery
but
this
beer
world
class
do
yourself
a
favor
and
go
buy
a
4pk
im
sad
this
was
the
last
one
left
at
our
local
liquor
store
as
i
said
earlier
this
is
a
solid
medium
body
beer
that
gives
southern
tier
pumking
a
run
for
there
money
its
big
on
the
pumpkin
flavor
which
imo
how
a
pumpkin
beer
should
be
bought
this
on
a
whim
while
at
my
local
beer
store
wasnt
getting
my
hopes
up
too
high
as
i
am
quite
picky
about
my
pumpkin
beers
i
do
not
like
a
lot
of
spice
overpowering
everything
several
other
pumpkin
ales
have
almost
nauseated
me
and
consequentially
became
instant
drain
cleaner
i
really
have
to
say
that
this
is
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
and
ive
had
quite
a
few
i
liked
this
even
more
than
southern
tier
pumking
shipyard
smashed
pumpkin
and
several
others
i
liked
this
so
much
i
was
inspired
to
write
this
my
first
full
review
im
not
going
to
break
down
the
taste
mouthfeel
etc
just
want
to
note
that
i
found
this
to
be
the
best
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
to
date
i
am
going
out
to
my
local
homebrew
store
soon
to
get
ingredients
to
try
and
clone
this
way
to
go
whole
hog
o
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
ive
had
just
because
of
how
darned
authentic
balanced
it
is
they
really
took
the
essence
of
a
pie
and
put
it
in
a
bottle
of
beer
a
really
refreshing
and
solid
pumpkin
ale
this
is
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
o
whole
hog
pumpkin
ale
is
definitely
the
equivalent
of
a
piece
of
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
whole
hog
got
it
right
from
smell
color
and
texture
a
must
to
have
on
thanksgiving
with
friends
and
family
very
rich
in
flavor
and
character
with
all
the
classic
pumpkin
pie
qualities
finally
a
pumpkin
ale
thats
not
too
boozy
but
still
has
a
kick
not
water
down
a
faint
taste
of
pumpkin
yet
still
a
fullflavored
winter
beverage
probably
the
best
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
ive
had
so
far
and
i
love
pumpkin
ales
delicious
grab
a
bottle
o
perfect
for
the
cooler
fall
days
whole
hog
pumpkin
ale
is
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
as
it
warms
up
so
too
do
you
with
its
inciting
aroma
delectable
flavor
luscious
mouthfeel
and
complex
warming
finish
if
its
a
rich
pumpkin
ale
you
crave
this
one
is
not
to
miss
and
make
sure
you
keep
some
on
hand
for
thanksgiving
as
it
almost
certainly
requests
a
pairing
with
the
classic
turkey
dinner
o
a
pleasant
straightforward
pumpkin
beer
decent
option
though
there
are
better
options
out
therebut
considering
the
price
point
this
will
work
o
hands
down
the
best
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
this
one
actually
tastes
like
pumpkin
i
will
definitely
be
having
this
beer
with
my
thanksgiving
meal
this
season
for
those
you
who
are
down
on
pumpkin
ales
give
this
take
a
try
and
it
might
change
your
opinion
the
appearance
and
aroma
was
a
little
misleading
but
this
is
a
really
great
pumpkin
ale
bold
heavy
sweet
and
flavorful
overall
what
a
surprise
this
pumpkin
was
maybe
i
really
am
just
looking
for
pumpkin
pie
in
a
glass
i
suppose
that
isnt
a
bad
thing
talk
about
a
beer
that
goes
well
with
the
season
and
tastes
great
to
boot
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
robust
for
a
pumpkin
ale
and
complements
the
flavor
profile
nicely
the
overall
experience
only
enhances
as
the
beer
warms
lending
even
more
vitality
and
depth
of
flavor
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
whole
hog
is
the
closest
ive
come
to
finding
a
pumpkin
ale
that
embodies
what
ive
always
imagined
a
pumpkin
ale
should
be
a
smooth
rich
flavorful
beer
infused
with
the
essence
of
authentic
pumpkin
pie
a
real
winner
to
be
fair
this
was
not
a
quick
sipper
like
so
many
other
beers
that
are
out
during
this
season
it
added
a
bit
of
a
warming
effect
as
i
finished
this
up
but
it
didnt
detract
from
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
this
would
never
dare
be
labelled
as
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
but
this
was
right
up
there
with
the
southern
tier
pumpking
on
the
musthaves
for
the
season
i
cant
wait
to
finish
the
rest
of
the
4pack
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
and
different
pumpkin
beer
its
definitely
darker
and
maltier
than
most
pumpkin
ales
that
ive
had
giving
the
beer
a
nice
caramelsweet
aroma
and
flavor
theres
also
a
solid
amount
of
gingerbread
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
something
that
i
havent
experienced
in
a
pumpkin
beer
yet
the
7
5
is
hidden
very
well
too
this
is
the
first
ive
ever
heard
of
stevens
point
but
ill
be
looking
for
more
from
them
in
the
future
overall
a
really
amazing
pumpkin
beer
that
more
people
need
to
try
i
wish
more
could
be
made
like
this
i
love
pumpkin
pie
but
this
beer
can
cause
someone
to
hate
pumpkin
pie
because
it
sucks
horse
ass
so
bad
this
is
a
really
nice
pumpkin
ale
it
has
some
qualities
ive
never
come
across
in
the
style
its
traditional
with
a
unique
original
twist
the
best
part
about
it
is
that
it
tastes
very
good
which
is
always
a
good
thing
highly
recommended
a
pretty
decent
and
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
good
flavor
would
have
this
again
there
are
other
pumpkin
ales
that
id
rather
have
but
not
a
lot
consider
me
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
stevens
point
whole
hog
pumpkin
well
integrated
spices
with
the
base
beer
everything
fits
well
highly
recommended
trust
me
just
to
reiterate
how
good
this
beer
is
i
had
a
fall
beer
fest
with
a
handful
of
my
good
beer
friends
and
this
one
stole
the
show
o
this
is
a
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
would
recommend
it
to
anybody
who
is
looking
for
a
beer
that
fits
the
season
aside
from
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
this
is
the
perfect
pumpkin
ale
in
my
opinion
o
smells
amazing
and
has
a
ton
of
nice
flavor
but
not
quite
perfect
o
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
you
get
the
feeling
that
there
is
actually
pumpkin
used
in
this
recipe
from
some
of
the
residual
flavors
and
the
spices
arent
ridiculously
in
your
face
as
they
are
in
so
many
other
examples
of
the
style
definitely
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
an
exceptionally
wellbalanced
refreshing
pumpkin
ale
that
avoids
tipping
the
scales
too
far
in
any
direction
a
great
find
and
one
of
the
better
in
the
style
ive
had
give
this
one
a
try
you
will
thank
yourself
overall
i
give
it
a
4
5
a
truely
amazing
pumpkin
ale
o
very
good
and
intense
pumpkin
ale
with
abv
well
hidden
light
to
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
recommended
poured
a
burnt
amber
color
with
a
slight
chill
haze
and
a
small
bubbly
cap
of
whitish
head
nice
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
and
ginger
snaps
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
subtle
but
still
adequately
pronounced
right
up
front
caramel
nutmeg
cloves
ginger
a
touch
of
cinnamon
entering
midpalate
is
a
bit
more
bitterness
from
the
pumpkin
pulp
and
just
a
tiny
hint
of
leafy
hoppiness
lightmedium
body
crisp
and
drinkable
o
good
beer
id
try
this
and
the
other
whole
hog
line
again
i
find
their
seasonals
and
limited
releases
are
much
better
than
the
year
round
offerings
this
is
a
good
all
around
sessionable
pumpkin
ale
i
enjoy
this
one
and
with
it
being
7
5
abv
it
goes
down
way
easy
good
stuff
overall
i
liked
it
it
was
a
big
surprise
to
find
it
and
even
better
to
try
it
the
sweetness
wasnt
overbearing
and
the
pumpkinspices
were
balanced
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tried
i
would
recommend
it
this
is
a
tasty
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
others
where
it
was
too
unbalanced
but
this
is
quite
tasty
all
the
flavors
work
well
together
and
nothing
is
too
overpowering
alcohol
is
hidden
well
this
is
generally
a
quality
pumpkin
beer
though
the
alcohol
level
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
high
and
unmasked
spices
are
a
bit
overpronounced
none
of
these
qualities
ruin
the
beer
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
malt
character
to
smooth
things
out
perhaps
a
decrease
in
alcohol
levels
would
facilitate
the
same
thing
d
with
the
initial
boozy
spicy
hit
and
the
apparent
and
relatively
high
abv
this
for
me
is
no
easy
drinker
i
really
like
the
well
done
pumpkin
in
this
one
but
would
like
more
malty
flavor
and
body
to
provide
a
richer
base
for
the
booze
and
spice
and
to
round
out
the
beer
the
added
heft
would
also
contribute
to
the
sipper
quality
of
this
fine
seasonal
i
could
actually
go
for
a
tad
less
spice
and
booze
too
and
maybe
a
touch
more
pronounced
on
the
pumpkin
this
has
some
interesting
character
it
offers
a
spicy
change
to
the
lineup
of
the
brewers
in
stevens
point
ill
say
it
again
im
getting
increasingly
proud
of
my
brothers
beer
selections
this
one
pours
a
clear
rubyamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
cinnamon
nutmeg
french
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
graham
crackers
the
taste
runs
very
similarly
with
that
pumpkin
pie
kinda
flavor
but
the
sweetness
of
it
all
is
dulled
slightly
by
a
splash
of
pumpkin
seeds
and
orange
peel
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
tasty
gem
of
a
pumpkin
beer
something
you
dont
find
too
many
of
these
days
this
imperial
pumpkin
ale
has
some
meat
the
complexities
make
you
think
about
the
style
all
over
again
while
it
begs
to
be
paired
with
your
typical
turkey
dinner
moreys
bottom
line
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
reminds
me
a
bit
of
schlafly
pumpkin
ale
which
is
a
huge
compliment
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
burnt
orange
color
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
frothy
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
aroma
is
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
flavors
in
this
brew
as
just
like
i
smell
in
the
aroma
but
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
strong
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
its
still
good
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
has
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
not
a
bad
overall
pumpkin
ale
id
buy
this
again
in
the
future
its
definitely
worth
a
try
one
or
two
of
these
would
be
the
most
i
would
have
if
the
spices
were
a
bit
more
subdued
this
one
would
be
even
more
drinkable
for
the
style
it
fits
in
nicely
if
youre
a
pumpkin
pie
fan
this
one
is
a
must
try
overall
a
new
favorite
pumpkin
ale
finally
a
pumpkin
ale
that
actually
tastes
like
a
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
without
being
overly
spiced
excellent
work
balancing
everything
out
without
losing
the
spice
pumpkin
hop
and
malt
flavors
great
job
on
this
beer
and
a
well
hidden
7
4
to
boot
wish
i
would
have
grabbed
a
whole
4
pack
the
only
real
redeeming
quality
of
this
beer
was
the
high
abv
was
unnoticeable
you
could
look
pretty
cool
getting
wasted
of
your
ass
at
a
frat
party
oo
notes
overall
i
liked
it
and
think
it
is
a
solid
allaround
pumpkin
ale
with
its
abv
and
heavy
spicing
you
may
not
want
too
many
in
a
row
however
pours
a
clear
burnt
orangeamber
with
a
fluffy
white
head
not
much
retention
and
just
a
hint
of
laceing
aroma
is
of
spiced
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
some
carbonation
taste
is
of
creamy
pumpkin
pie
spicywith
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
maybe
even
some
chocolate
excellent
whole
hog
pumpkin
ale
would
have
been
better
beer
if
stevens
point
had
gone
whole
hog
the
spice
used
the
spice
load
and
the
abv
are
perfectly
fine
more
malt
though
would
have
bulked
this
little
piggy
up
and
might
have
turned
him
into
a
blue
ribbon
hog
that
could
have
shared
the
stage
with
some
of
the
styles
best
taste
it
really
tastes
like
a
liquid
pumpkin
pie
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
this
flavor
but
i
am
trying
to
be
unbiased
if
you
like
pumpkin
pie
this
would
be
a
really
good
beer
probably
better
then
most
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
d
to
me
they
went
overboard
on
the
abv
the
usual
range
for
this
style
is
47
the
7
5
alcohol
in
this
isnt
really
hidden
that
well
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
better
brew
if
it
had
a
lower
abv
they
seemed
to
be
right
there
with
the
pumpkin
taste
in
this
brew
though
if
you
enjoy
pumpkin
pie
you
may
very
well
enjoy
this
beer
d
spot
on
for
a
perfect
fall
pumpkin
beer
to
be
enjoyed
right
up
until
to
thanksgiving
dinner
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
i
found
it
much
better
than
the
whole
hog
ipa
purchased
from
three
cellars
in
franklin
wi
pours
a
reddish
amber
body
with
a
short
white
head
that
quickly
fades
aroma
is
of
pumkin
pie
spices
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
caramelized
sugar
and
cinnamon
are
too
over
the
top
and
dominate
in
the
taste
no
other
flavors
get
a
chance
to
come
through
this
is
just
too
onedimensional
and
not
very
good
overall
a
very
good
one
or
two
beer
with
decent
flavor
for
a
gateway
beer
but
the
flavors
just
seemed
to
artificial
drinkability
is
suprizingly
good
for
a
pumpkin
brew
the
aromatic
notes
are
heavy
on
the
spice
but
on
the
palate
the
profile
is
cleverly
well
balanced
and
much
less
spiced
a
solid
pumpkin
brew
that
has
the
spice
but
does
not
overdo
it
just
picked
this
up
from
my
local
bottle
shop
poured
into
my
pint
glass
the
beer
is
brownish
slightly
red
hue
a
half
inch
of
tan
head
rests
on
top
no
lacing
left
at
all
the
aroma
is
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
clove
nutty
roast
malt
is
present
as
well
it
smells
rather
close
to
pumpkin
pie
the
flavor
however
is
not
as
strong
light
pumpkin
flavor
up
front
but
it
fades
rather
quick
luckily
as
it
fades
a
nice
buttery
nuttiness
takes
over
cinnimonnutmeg
and
clove
are
also
very
noticeable
just
not
as
pumpkin
as
i
would
have
liked
medium
to
light
body
moderate
carbonation
some
alcohol
can
be
picked
up
a
decent
beer
overall
not
the
worst
pumpkin
ive
had
but
far
from
the
best
worth
a
try
i
am
not
a
big
pumpkin
guy
but
this
beer
did
not
overpower
with
spices
featuring
them
mostly
on
the
finish
beer
is
a
bit
watery
for
a
stout
of
my
liking
but
a
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
the
head
is
small
and
tan
it
has
a
modest
aroma
a
little
grain
faint
pumpkin
pie
spice
but
not
inyourface
the
flavor
though
is
solid
some
sweetness
malt
pumpkin
flavor
and
spice
as
well
it
all
comes
out
in
the
flavor
full
body
and
satisfying
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
cold
autumn
night
color
is
dark
brown
with
ruby
edges
getting
some
pumpkin
and
pie
spice
in
the
nose
but
its
not
very
strong
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
the
stout
qualities
are
light
not
much
roastiness
nevertheless
my
guess
is
that
a
strong
stout
would
overwhelm
the
pumpkin
flavors
either
way
this
is
interesting
but
not
worth
repeating
delicious
example
of
an
american
stout
with
the
roasted
malt
and
mouthfeel
as
the
key
qualities
the
pumpkin
is
an
afterthought
however
i
personally
like
less
pumpkin
but
this
is
not
enough
for
the
pumpkin
beer
lover
i
would
probably
like
this
beer
more
as
a
straightup
stout
without
the
pumpkin
i
love
a
good
stout
and
merging
it
together
with
the
pumpkin
spices
of
fall
make
this
exceptionally
good
lots
of
spices
in
this
one
i
would
consider
it
as
a
christmas
brew
good
balance
and
no
offflavours
overall
a
good
stout
that
was
even
better
because
its
a
fall
seasonal
in
the
pumpkin
theme
a
nice
change
of
pace
brew
o
love
the
idea
love
that
it
isnt
over
the
top
spicy
or
boozy
very
good
cheers
i
do
somewhat
wish
it
was
a
bigger
bolder
beer
but
then
im
also
so
impressed
by
how
well
the
beer
is
crafted
stout
and
pumpkin
integration
fyi
i
am
eating
a
reeses
peanut
butter
cup
and
it
pairs
really
well
pours
into
a
becker
a
deep
dark
chocolate
color
with
a
nice
creamy
beige
head
that
never
really
completely
settlesjust
a
nice
creamy

a
few

on

with

a
backup
rolea
little
chocolate
in
the
finish
it
is
just
a
tad
sweet
for
me
to
be
considered
great
but
the
feel
is
top
notch
and
it
has
nice
flavors
bottom
line
interesting
beer
o
this
is
just
another
pumpkin
ale
im
not
terribly
enthused
by
and
the
stout
part
is
a
letdown
however
its
not
bad
it
feels
great
in
the
mouth
and
isnt
undrinkable
its
just
kind
of
boring
is
all
worth
trying
but
i
wont
buy
again
overall
what
is
this
you
call
yourself
a
stout
you
better
back
it
up
and
this
doesnt
did
someone
switch
the
labels
from
another
beer
nothing
about
this
resembles
a
stout
spices
are
present
but
this
is
more
of
a
redamber
ale
false
advertising
and
a
pass

as
part
of

this
stuff
pours
a
very
dark
black
brown
an
inky
cola
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
brown
sugar
light
cinnamon
clove
and
light
cocoa
powder
the
taste
holds
notes
of
cola
brown
sugar
molasses
light
hickory
smoke
and
clove
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thinly
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
little
stout
i
suppose
the
smoke
character
i
got
was
actually
some
toasted
pumpkin
seeds
or
something
but
it
doesnt
really
matter
all
that
much
if
this
stuff
were
a
smidge
thicker
this
would
be
some
great
beerage
gotta
say
got
neither
pumpkin
nor
stout
nor
fisherman
but
i
doubt
thats
an
ingredient
from
this
beer
im
pretty
sure
dat
ash
was
actually
the
added
spices
now
that
i
know
i
can
pick
up
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
maybe
but
that
doesnt
change
my
impression
nicely
crafted
could
use
more
pumpkin
good
stout
nonetheless
though
this
brew
had
some
weight
and
body
to
it
it
was
very
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
it
thought
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
almost
non
existent
overall
i
feel
i
should
get
another
bottle
and
see
how
it
compares
not
proud
of
myself
for
spilling
this
all
over
the
place
o
this
is
my
first
pumpkin
stout
and
i
really
dont
know
why
there
arent
more
of
these
these
spices
work
so
well
with
the
huge
maltiness
of
stouts
very
enjoyable
on
a
cold
autumn
night
o
the
stout
and
the
slight
pumpkin
really
take
over
the
flavor
profile
the
spices
take
a
seat
in
the
back
of
this
beer
the
roasted
malt
has
some
moments
of
sweetness
but
the
earthy
pumpkin
and
bitter
coffee
keep
the
stout
honest
overall
i
am
not
getting
much
pumpkin
out
of
this
beer
still
a
pretty
decent
tasting
beer
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
the
beer
tastes
rich
and
chocolaty
with
much
fainter
hints
of
the
pumpkin
than
there
was
in
the
smell
roasted
malts
are
also
present
but
there
is
a
lingering
hint
of
metal
that
mixes
with
the
pumpkin
and
brings
down
the
overall
enjoyment
of
this
beer
the
spices
are
also
rather
faint
in
the
beer
until
the
aftertaste
where
they
ring
out
as
cinnamon
allspice
and
nutmeg
though
they
too
could
be
contributing
to
the
metallic
tinge
mouthfeel
is
slightly
prickly
and
quite
thin
though
it
thickens
a
little
if
swished
around
the
mouth
the
tongue
is
left
pretty
clean
with
just
a
hint
of
saliva
and
a
little
roasted
dryness
at
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
disappointing
ive
had
the
imperial
pumpkin
stout
and
it
by
far
surpasses
it
in
everything
as
might
be
expected
but
it
seems
like
the
stout
is
just
missing
something
that
shouldnt
be
missing
i
liked
my
initial
sips
of
this
but
as
it
grew
in
my
mouth
it
brought
a
weird
metallic
taste
that
i
couldnt
shake
it
is
a
cool
next
step
for
the
style
of
the
pumpkin
beer
and
i
still
think
its
worth
a
taste
but
i
would
recommend
the
imperial
pumpkin
stout
over
the
plain
stout
if
youre
looking
for
good
flavoring
o
really
awesome
pumpkin
brew
highly
recommended
nice
change
from
typical
pumpkin
ales
my
favorite
non
imperial
pumpkin
ale
o
not
impressed
i
enjoy
imperial
pumpkin
ales
and
stouts
but
this
was
my
first
pumpkin
stout
and
it
was
okay
not
a
rebuy
for
me
but
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
o
i
was
hoping
for
a
bigger
flavor
but
that
being
said
this
was
still
a
good
tasting
beer
but
was
much
more
subtle
flavor
than
i
was
hoping
for
o
i
just
found
out
there
is
an
imperial
version
of
this
beer
id
like
to
try
that
one
because
this
pumpkin
stout
was
one
of
my
favorites
this
year
a
great
nose
nice
flavor
profile
could
use
some
help
with
the
finish
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
nice
hybrid
of
a
stout
and
a
pumpkin
ale
o
nice
departure
from
your
typical
pumpkin
ale
the
roasted
malt
really
compliments
the
pumpkin
flavor
super
smooth
and
drinkable
too
one
of
my
favorites
a
big
shout
out
to
travisnd
for
sending
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
taste
is
roasted
malts
up
front
setteling
in
with
some
smoth
pumpkin
flavor
not
much
spices
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
overall
not
another
shabby
pumpkin
beer
a
pumpkin
stout
is
different
and
enjoyable
would
be
cool
to
try
this
on
draft
or
nitro
will
work
up
to
their
imperial
pumpkin
stout
next
if
i
can
find
one
in
the
next
few
weeks
o
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
look
forward
to
next
autumn
when
it
comes
back
around
i
would
recommend
even
if
there
was
no
pumpkin
included
some
people
complain
that
they
cant
drink
more
than
one
pumpkin
beer
i
defy
you
to
only
drink
one
of
these
pours
a
twofingered
light
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
some
lace
black

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
julios

westborough
ma
o
a
solid
offering
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
buy
another
or
try
the
imperial
in
the
future
for
me
lack
of
discernible
pumpkin
keeps
this
beer
from
being
great
o
this
is
solid
and
id
probably
try
it
once
a
season
if
i
were
local
but
its
not
something
that
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
trade
for
huge
brown
head
that
stays
for
quite
a
while
and
then
evaporates
black
brown
fluid
is
impervious
to

is
dark
a
roasty
with
coffee
and
and
chocolate
burnt

and
subtle
pumpkin

is
savory
and
inviting
earthy
hops
give
a
nice
balance

is
full
of
coffee
and
chocolate
covered
mild
pumpkin
some
notes
of

good
roasted

has
me
lovin
this
brew
finish
is
dry
with
notes
of
earth
and
vanilla
and
more
subtle
pumpkinand
spice
feel
nice
and
light
like
a
dry
irish
stout
and
super
drinkable
easy
to
knock
back
quite
a
few
of
these
as
the
abv
is
completely
hidden
an
excellent
beer
that
blossoms
as
it
warms
up
delicious
to
start
and
improves
with
each
sip
thinks
ill
get
another
growler
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
really
easy
and
i
could
easily
knock
a
few
of
these
back
this
has
a
really
nice
flavor
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
dont
know
why
more
breweries
arent
making
pumpkin
stouts
i
think
the
combination
works
really
well
at
least
in
this
beer
it
does
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
interesting
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smooth
i
recommend
checking
it
out
o
this
was
the
first
pumpkin
stout
i
have
ever
had
it
was
good
for
a
stout
but
the
pumpkin
was
too
difficult
to
pick
up
i
served
it
at
cellar
temp
which
i
do
with
most
stouts
i
am
wondering
if
i
should
have
served
it
a
little
cooler
could
the
stout
characteristics
have
taken
over
because
of
the
temp
either
way
the
beer
was
good
and
worth
a
try
o
thin
in
both
mouthfeel
and
flavor
resulting
in
a
decent
drinkable
but
rather
unimpressive
beer
the
double
version
was
much
more
impressive
taste
and
feel
drier
in
the
middle
than
i
would
have
thought
and
not
as
full
bodied
as
i
expected
a
tad
watery
for
a
stout
or
an
ale
after
a
bit
it
doesnt
taste
like
anything
carbonation
is
quite
present
neat
mouthfeel
but
i
have
no
flavors
to
speak
of
it
should
taste
like
something
right
not
drain
pouring
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
have
had
friends
say
the
opposite
of
what
im
writing
so
maybe
its
just
a
bad
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
hue
with
a
light
brown
head
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
and
complex
with
nutmeg
clove
pumpkin
toast
and
mocha
nice
mix
of
pumpkin
and
stout
in
the
flavor
profile
spicy
could
be
a
bit
more
full
bodied
however
and
there
is
some
sort
of
oxidized
taste
in
the
finish
that
puts
me
off
a
bit
ooverall
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
cape
ann
i
like
the
combination
of
flavors
and
i
like
that
the
pumpkin
beer
is
a
stout
i
like
that
they
are
trying
to
mix
it
up
trying
something
different
cape
ann
is
slowly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
im
a
man
who
likes
his
pumpkin
beers
packed
with
pumpkin
and
fishermans
pumpkin
stout
doesnt
really
deliver
there
the
gourd
here
seems
to
be
more
of
an
afterthought
and
even
the
stout
flavor
is
too
light
o
good
beer
really
like
the
balance
of
the
flavors
needed
a
little
more
body
in
my
opinion
but
thats
the
only
problem
i
had
with
it
a
very
nice
beer
served
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
large
tan
head
black
color
and
notes
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
chocolate
the
first
sip
is
very
thick
and
almost
syrupy
in
the
mouth
fishermans
pumpkin
stout
on
a
nitrotap
actually
has
more
flavors
than
in
the
bottle
our
first
sip
had
flavors
of
nutmeg
chocolate
with
hints
of
cinnamon
cardamom
and
a
slight
maple
vanilla
flavors
had
it
at
the
good
life
in
massapequa
ny
overall
a
good
beer
but
lacking
on
the
pumpkinspice
elements
the
roasted
malt
dominates
o
not
bad
a
nice
brew
to
mix
up
the
selection
at
a
party
in
the
fall
my
initial
opinion
holds
up
this
doesnt
work
as
a
pumpkin
beer
but
it
does
work
as
a
bitterchocolatewithspices
beer
tasty
but
not
a
highly
drinkable
stout
because
of
the
spices
still
the
beer
does
a
good
job
of
masking

a

with
not
much
of
a

is
a
moderate
one
with
a
malty

overall
this
has
quite
an
enjoyable
milk
stout
taste
and
smooth

crisp

refreshing

sweet

really
quenches
the
palate
and
though
i
cant
admit
that
id
be
able
to
pinpoint
pumpkin
in
a
blind
tasting
i
can
definitely
detect
an
earthy
herbal
hint
of
fall
in
the
finish
o
the
thought
of
a
pumpkin
stout
sounds
great
but
this
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
have
a
5
left
and
may
revisit
this
review
if
the
experience
differs
a
pumpkin
seasonal
that
is
a
stout
very
interesting
tried
this
at
as
a
gift
from
my
father
pours
a
darkish
brown
color
not
much
head
to
it
taste
is
a
bit
watered
down
higher
abv
is
well
hidden
pumpkin
shines
through
a
bit
but
for
the
most
part
is
subdued
tastes
more
like
a
generic
above
average
stout
to
me
while
i
commend
the
brewery
for
trying
something
different
with
a
pumpkin
beer
i
felt
the
pumpkin
taste
isnt
as
prevalent
as
it
should
be
pretty
good
beer
overall
though
finally
got
this
in
a
trade
from
nyc
pours
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
thin
offwhite
ring
aroma
of
chocolate
and
hops
nutmeg
a
hint
of
allspice
and
vanilla
taste
is
medium
bodied
with
more
distinct
chocolate
and
pumpkin
flavors
with
some
biting
hops
and
oak
finish
is
semisweet
a
light
smoked
background
with
mild
pumpkin
aftertaste
very
interesting
more
hops
than
i
would
expect
and
not
as
much
pumpkin
spice
as
i
would
have
liked
but
a
very
good
brew
overall
this
is
a
above
average
tasting
stout
and
my
first
pumpkin
flavored
stout
ive
always
wanted
to
try
one
since
i
have
tried
many
pumpkin
ales
i
had
higher
expectations
but
it
was
still
tasty
enough
to
enjoy
onot
a
bad
beer
but
i
thought
it
was
a
little
understated
in
all
aspects
if
all
of
the
characteristics
were
emphasized
a
bit
more
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
nice
style
addition
to
all
the
pumpkin
ales
that
are
out
there
it
just
fell
a
bit
short
a
solid
fall
seasonal
beer
that
ill
definitely
be
revisiting
later
in
the
season
recommended
small
cap
of
beige
head
pretty
pitch
black
except
at
the
very
edges
aromas
are
sweet
mostly
reminiscent
of
pumpkin
spice
and
vanilla
flavors
are
subtle
roasty
pumpkin
and
tad
bit
of
herbal
bitterness
at
the
back
not
overwhelming
by
any
means
but
balanced
nicely
a
little
too
carbonated
and
thin
for
my
stout
tastes
but
nothing
to
really
complain
about
a
smattering
of
head
not
much
lacing
may
give
it
a
shot
on
tap
but
certainly
in
no
rush
to
do
so
pours
a
mahogany
black
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
that
quickly
dissipates
and
does
not
lace
aroma
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
a
bit
of
roasted
coffee
flavor
begins
with
classic
pumpkin
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
lead
the
way
the
roasted
malts
are
up
next
tastes
a
bit
like
burnt
gingerbread
strong
black
coffee
as
well
and
just
hints
of
mashed
pumpkin
sweetness
as
the
beer
warms
o
tasty
pumpkin
stout
although
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
spice
notes
to
really
bring
out
the
pumpkin
flavors
overall
while
i
thought
this
beer
showed
promise
on
the
nose
the
overlyheavy
spices
and
bike
tube
overtones
revealed
in
the
mouth
spoil
the
brew
i
actually
put
off
reviewing
this
beer
for
quite
a
while
hoping
that
the
first
few
bottles
out
of
the
sixpack
were
bad
or
that
i
was
just
having
a
bad
beertasting
day
i
suppose
its
possible
that
ive
had
a
bad
batch
but
im
not
sure
that
i
care
to
purchase
another
sixpack
to
see
o
a
fantastic
riff
on
the
fall
pumpkin
style
what
sometimes
gets
ordinary
and
too
full
of
spice
and
nothing
else
this
is
a
brew
that
lets
a
load
of
flavors
shine
thru
just
a
bad
recipe
maybe
to
some
people
it
sounds
good
but
you
also
have
to
execute
something
that
sounds
good
it
does
taste
good
but
the
smell
is
way
off
that
being
said
the
people
at
southern
tier
shoudl
take
a
note
of
this
brands
subtlety
o
i
bought
a
case
of
this
stuff
and
might
buy
another
quite
possibly
my
favorite
seasonal
beer
thumbs
way
up
o
overall
i
expected
a
bit
more
i
think
theres
room
for
more
spice
and
more
sweetness
in
a
pumpkin
stout
without
over
doing
it
in
fact
the
body
may
be
too
thin
to
rightly
call
this
a
stout
in
my
mind
still
there
are
good
flavors
here
and
balance
o
overall
this
is
still
a
damn
good
beer
i
could
pound
these
back
all
day
due
to
the
nonstout
mouthfeel
its
a
nice
beer
but
its
not
the
imperial
version
now
that
is
a
pumpkin
stout
this
pumpkin
stout
pours
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
it
the
smell
have
some
pretty
good
spices
on
the
nose
the
flavor
of
the
beer
kind
of
lacked
for
me
the
spicy
nose
doesnt
transfer
over
to
the
taste
all
that
much
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
for
a
stout
overall
its
a
decent
brew
for
the
style
its
probably
worth
checking
out
in
the
fall
dark
brown
color
in
the
glass
minimal
carbonation
a
few
tan
bubbles
surface
from
the
beer
but
only
after
a
foot
high
pour
aromas
are
light
and
simple
hints
of
pumpkin
spice
and
chocolate
waft
through
but
you
have
to
get
in
the
glass
close
to
pick
it
up
flavors
are
nice
pumpkin
is
well
integrated
not
overpowering
minimal
sweetness
the
spices
play
well
with
the
chocolate
notes
toward
the
finish
carbonation
is
more
present
when
sipping
it
has
a
nice
crispness
to
the
finish
overall
nothing
spectacular
but
a
definite
quaffer
for
fall
time
not
bad
on
a
spring
morning
either
this
stuff
is
dark
black
solid
as
a
brick
with
a
wimpy
light
tan
ring
on
top
and
fair
lacing
the
aroma
is
subtle
juniper
and
light
charcoal
nice
but
very
mild
the
flavor
offers
slightly
diluted
spruce
hop
and
pumpkin
herbal
ideas
you
might
describe
this
as
ginger
and
cinnamon
along
the
lines
of
a
holiday
brew
this
is
medium
light
bodied
with
very
little
carbonation
almost
none
surprising
the
evergreen
dominates
and
pumpkin
is
a
bit
hard
to
detect
in
my
mind
its
a
pretty
watery
feel
which
disappoints
but
generally
i
would
say
this
is
still
a
pretty
different
pumpkin
brew
not
sure
about
the
stout
qualities
but
it
is
interesting
d
overall
im
hoping
this
was
a
bad
bottle
nothing
i
would
want
again
12oz
bottle
poured
into
dimpled
mug
pours
dark
brown
with
a
small
light
brown
head
aroma
is
semisweet
with
a
lot
of
pumpkin
a
litle
cinnamon
and
some
nutmeg
surprisingly
little
malt
andor
hops
show
through
in
the
taste
it
is
a
different
story
though
definite
roasted
malt
balanced
by
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitternes
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
had
suggested
it
would
be
the
transition
to
the
pumpkin
finish
is
seamless
and
the
pumpkin
is
excellent
good
mouthfeel
quite
smooth
and
has
a
long
lingering
finish
of
pumpkin
d
does
not
taste
like
7
abv
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
fairly
drinkable
but
unfortunately
is
a
bit
forgettable
d
split
a
bomber
three
ways
and
had
no
problem
finishing
could
see
having
this
on
a
cold
night
the
flavor
is
too
aggressive
to
drink
several
glasses
but
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
and
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
notes
for
me
this
beer
was
ok
but
i
was
looking
for
something
to
really
stand
out
i
think
i
would
like
cape
anns
imperial
pumpkin
stout
more
but
thats
just
a
wild
guess
overall
i
was
a
fan
of
this
beer
a
very
close
approximation
of
treat
which
i
believe
is
the
only
other
pumpkin
stout
ive
had
a
very
nice
substyle
and
this
beer
is
well
worth
a
shot
this
is
really
smelling
and
tasting
more
like
a
pumpkin
brown
ale
an
overly
dark
pumpkin
brown
ale
d
theres
something
i
dont
like
about
this
beer
but
its
really
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
it
appearance
is
decent
and
feel
is
actually
very
good
however
the
flavors
present
here
just
dont
work
for
me
worth
a
try
if
just
for
the
semiodd
combination
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
myself
d
relatively
good
drink
for
a
pumpkin
ale
i
like
the
balance
between
the
stout
and
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
a
nice
change
from
the
usual
pumpkin
ale
definitely
doesnt
really
deliver
a
pumpkin
stout
as
i
had
hoped
it
basically
tastes
like
an
average
stout
with
high
sweetness
and
very
faint
fall
spices
not
a
bad
beer
but
could
be
better
pours
near
black
with
a
slight
mocha
head
and
a
tad
bit
of
lacing
nose
is
roast
and
chocolate
with
some
pumpkin
and
ligt
spicing
in
the
background
the
taste
is
the
same
and
is
more
lime
a
stout
with
just
a
bit
of
pumpkin
good
feel
with
a
bit
of
dryness
drinks
well
and
is
a
nice
twist
on
the
style
overall
this
is
a
delite
couldnt
possibly
be
more
drinkable
its
just
so
smooth
and
creamy
and
its
dangerously
drinkable
crazy
good
notes
a
truly
unique
beer
though
i
feel
it
could
use
some
work
appearance
is
rather
lackluster
with
poor
head
formation
and
retention
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
it
seems
a
bit
undercarbonated
however
these
faults
are
not
enough
to
completely
detract
from
the
overall
drinking
experience
spicing
is
well
balanced
and
incorporated
very
well
into
the
stout
style
making
for
a
very
original
and
tasty
beer
d
im
liking
this
beer
but
it
isnt
blowing
me
away
a
slightly
different
take
on
the
pumpkin
beers
which
i
appreciate
a
worthy
pumpkin
beer
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
but
not
sure
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
once
the
season
is
over
i
had
a
sixteen
ounce
pour
of
this
at
the
amsterdam
ale
house
on
the
upper
west
side
of
manhattan
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
as
a
stout
sounded
interesting
it
was
very
dark
in
color
and
had
a
good
pumpkin
spice
aroma
with
not
an
overwhelming
flavor
low
on
the
hops
pretty
tasty
wont
have
it
again
but
it
was
worth
trying
d
a
wonderfully
frothy
stout
but
i
cant
quite
mark
anything
remotely
pumpkin
about
it
other
than
the
fact
that
its
released
in
the
typical
time
when
pumpkins
are
harvested
so
this
is
a
decent
stout
if
yer
lookin
for
pumpkin
head
out
to
the
patch
id
get
this
again
on
tap
once
or
twice
a
season
d
a
great
dessert
beer
as
what
i
think
a
pumpkin
ale
should
be
very
drinkable
for
the
combination
of
styles
but
probably
wouldnt
finish
a
6pack
in
a
night
wanting
it
to
last
a
while
d
just
a
decent
stout
take
it
or
leave
it
d
this
was
a
very
solid
pumpkin
stout
the
first
i
have
tried
of
its
kind
this
combines
two
of
my
favorite
styles
which
seems
so
natural
a
pairing
i
am
surprised
i
havent
had
or
seen
one
before
i
wish
i
had
more
than
one
to
drink
big
thanks
to
boglehill
for
sending
this
unexpected
extra
my
way
the
beer
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
fresh
pumpkin
scent
along
with
a
solid
chocolate
and
black
malt
aroma
its
light
and
creamy
almost
like
a
guiness
with
pumpkin
added
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
light
almost
watery
black
malt
and
pumpkin
flavor
its
easily
quaffable
with
just
a
mild
earthy
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
seasonal
i
love
how
its
light
and
refreshing
not
heavy
and
alcohol
ridden
d
it
was
easy
to
put
down
but
wasnt
anything
incredible
the
only
real
pumpkinspice
i
get
out
of
this
beer
is
in
the
aftertaste
overall
this
beer
is
ok
it
took
some
getting
used
to
the
unique
flavor
profile
but
once
i
did
it
became
more
enjoyable
that
being
said
i
think
pumpkin
beers
and
stouts
were
two
styles
not
meant
to
mix
d
this
beer
is
truly
the
worst
pumpkin
stout
ive
had
yet
fortunately
for
it
ive
had
all
great
pumpkin
beers
for
a
seven
percent
it
doesnt
come
out
at
all
as
being
alcoholic
beverage
at
all
the
bouquet
is
lacking
the
flavors
are
monochromatic
and
the
oral
sensations
are
worse
than
a
juice
box
fishermans
pumpkin
stout
is
a
brownish
black
ale
it
takes
a
heavy
pour
but
a
small
light
khaki
head
emerges
and
quickly
fades
to
a
ring
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
huge
pumpkin
aroma
underneath
theres
a
little
roastiness
like
coffee
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
like
cola
its
pretty
light
bodied
and
smooth
the
clean
finish
is
a
little
chewy
theres
lots
of
pumpkin
and
a
little
roast
in
the
taste
theres
a
touch
of
sweetness
maybe
lactose
theres
not
really
any
bitterness
this
must
be
a
milk
stout
its
pretty
straightforward
and
very
drinkable
a
very
dark
ruby
brown
brew
with
a
thin
tan
lacy
head
that
fades
quickly
lightly
sweet
and
roasty
aroma
flavor
is
smooth
and
drinkable
perhaps
some
sweetness
from
the
pumpkin
but
its
rather
faint
mostly
this
is
just
a
typical
stout
not
much
sign
of
any
spices
either
oh
well
thought
id
try
it
just
to
see
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
average
beer
there
are
some
really
fine
pumpkin
beers
and
some
outrageous
stouts
why
drink
this
d
disappointing
i
was
so
incredibly
excited
to
try
this
when
i
pulled
it
from
our
trade
it
had
so
much
potential
and
it
just
fell
flat
after
the
nose
i
wouldnt
even
label
it
a
pumpkin
beer
it
needs
a
much
heavier
dose
of
pumpkin
and
spice
for
the
next
batch
to
combat
the
high
stout
flavors
unless
i
hear
its
changed
i
wont
be
having
this
again
di
appreciate
the
taste
and
was
surprised
by
this
beer
it
is
quite
drinkable
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
but
it
is
a
different
take
on
the
standard
pumpkin
ale
dm
nice
creamy
texture
and
balanced
strong
flavor
hard
on
your
flavor
but
id
almost
call
this
the
pumpkin
latte
of
beers
a
surprising
good
beer
with
a
rather
disappointing
look
flat
completely
but
on
the
account
of
a
good
body
feel
none
the
less
thanks
to
a
rather
mineral
zest
nose
of
predomantly
pumpkin
but
not
in
the
forward
malty
sense
some
nutmeg
that
tingles
the
tongue
quite
lean
malt
character
still
not
the
body
to
suit
the
style
but
first
pumpkin
beer
that
had
a
good
presence
pours
a
dark
oily
black
small
tan
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
with
some
faint
pumpkin
and
spices
in
the
background
taste
is
similar
the
bumpkin
is
in
the
back
seat
if
not
the
trunk
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
preferences
and
the
bubbles
a
bit
too
big
certainly
a
nice
way
to
start
the
fall
i
suppose
though
interesting
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
bottle
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
very
fluffy
slightly
tan
head
that
quickly
laces
on
the
glass
pumpkin
pie
notes
in
the
nose
really
smells
like
the
pumpkin
pie
canned
stuff
before
you
add
sugar
and
such
medium
mouthfeel
interesting
i
dont
get
as
much
pumpkin
in
the
taste
as
i
did
the
nose
but
it
for
sure
is
there
slight
pumpkin
taste
followed
by
roast
malt
flavor
very
smooth
actually
kind
of
surprise
as
this
one
as
typically
i
am
not
a
huge
pumpkin
fan
overall
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
the
pumpkin
and
spice
took
to
much
away
from
the
stout
part
of
this
beer
not
to
drinkable
for
me
db
not
into
this
one
the
malt
hops
and
spice
dont
blend
too
well
not
substantial
seems
thin
i
get
tired
if
the
spice
pretty
quickly
overall
the
beer
hits
the
stout
notes
however
briefly
and
the
pumpkin
notes
so
it
lives
up
to
its
name
doesnt
wow
me
impress
me
or
make
me
want
another
one
though
i
am
certainly
not
going
to
pour
this
out
ill
happily
finish
it
i
just
dont
see
a
situation
where
i
would
pick
this
beer
over
anything
else
d
easy
to
drink
fairly
inoffensive
but
pretty
forgettable
at
the
same
time
nothing
exceptional
about
this
beer
at
all
nothing
that
would
make
me
seek
it
out
again
d
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
ale
that
stands
out
in
a
sea
of
orange
colored
brews
if
you
can
find
a
six
pack
you
will
not
regret
buying
it
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
d
goes
down
real
easy
a
bit
too
easy
in
fact
i
wish
this
one
was
pumped
up
a
bit
with
more
stout
flavors
and
more
pumpkin
notes
however
this
one
does
mix
the
two
well
certainly
worth
trying
and
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
one
again
d
a
decent
stout
that
was
small
hints
of
pumpkin
if
you
like
coffee
stouts
its
worth
checking
out
but
it
is
not
really
a
pumpkin
beer
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
verges
on
black
with
a
tiny
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
properties
aromas
are
light
and
predominantly
of
pumpkins
with
distinct
notes
of
clove
cigarettes
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
are
also
present
each
of
these
notes
along
with
a
very
pleasant
roastiness
come
through
on
the
palate
but
im
disappointed
in
how
subdued
they
are
the
flavors
do
however
become
more
intense
as
the
beer
warms
12oz
bottle
picked
up
in
va
this
week
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
opaque
with
a
thick
tan
head
the
aroma
isnt
as
strong
with
pumpkin
spices
as
most
pumpkin
ales
which
is
nice
as
this
beer
is
a
unique
creation
the
pairing
of
these
spices
with
a
stout
is
inspired
the
roasted
malts
match
the
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
perfectly
smelling
more
strongly
of
stout
than
pumpkin
pie
it
tastes
just
as
good
a
roasted
malt
stout
with
malty
sweetness
counterplayed
against
a
light
sprinkling
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
in
fact
it
almost
tastes
more
like
pumpkin
itself
than
of
spices
really
this
is
growing
on
me
definitely
to
be
purchased
when
i
see
it
again
d
a
different
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
and
a
good
one
at
that
its
nice
to
look
outside
the
box
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
and
not
even
think
about
it
all
in
all
this
was
not
a
very
good
brew
the
smell
and
look
were
great
the
taste
failed
here
very
disappointing
taste
and
thats
the
best
part
of
beer
dont
bother
hunting
this
one
not
worth
your
time
drinkability
truly
a
beer
for
the
gourd
freaks
aside
from
the
acrid
roast
taste
theres
not
a
whole
lot
of
stout
character
could
not
get
into
this
one
sadly
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
this
is
quite
drinkable
while
it
isnt
a
tride
and
true
pumpkin
ale
it
definitely
ranks
up
there
as
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
ones
i
have
had
mostly
in
part
of
the
stout
character
and
the
lack
of
the
long
lasting
spices
that
are
not
overdone
in
this
brew
i
like
it
and
would
drink
it
again
d
really
nice
porter
with
a
pumpkin
flavor
this
wellincorporated
i
was
disappointed
with
this
beer
it
was
too
thin
for
a
stout
i
also
thought
the
pumpkin
should
have
been
a
little
more
dominant
pumpkin
stout
was
a
great
concept
hopefully
further
recipe
development
will
take
this
concept
to
a
higher
level
overall
okay
but
i
was
kind
of
let
down
by
this
one
the
idea
of
a
pumpkin
stout
sounds
good
on
paper
but
this
is
definitely
not
the
ideal
realization
of
that
attempt
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
getting
a
lot
more
attention
bravo
cape
ann
ive
bought
a
case
of
it
and
might
run
out
before
summers
over
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
right
away
very
solid
pumpkin
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
really
enjoyed
it
this
evening
i
really
liked
that
it
was
different
then
all
the
other
pumpkin
beers
on
the
shelf
you
can
actually
taste
the
pumpkin
for
a
change
d
smooth
creamy
very
drinkable
drinks
well
as
the
chocolate
roast
and
pumpkin
flavors
mesh
very
well
together
would
like
a
bit
more
stout
qualities
in
the
flavor
and
the
mouthfeel
but
this
is
still
probably
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
cool
weather
seasonals
its
not
hard
to
put
down
especially
if
you
like
pumpkin
but
even
though
i
dont
it
was
easily
managed
but
i
dont
see
it
being
a
multiple
hitter
in
the
same
evening
more
of
a
nice
alternative
kinda
thang
excellent
beer
perfect
winter
brew
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
opaque
black
with
a
thin
slightly
dirty
white
head
aroma
was
brown
sugar
sweet
with
some
vanilla
undertones
pumpkin
was
very
prevalent
in
the
flavor
not
overly
spicy
like
some
a
nice
mellow
pumpkin
pie
flavor
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
nice
thickness
and
carbonation
but
didnt
coat
as
well
as
it
could
have
pleasant
to
drink
a
very
solid
stout
f
finishes
semi
bitter
probably
both
the
stouty
roastedness
and
some
hints
of
hops
finishes
a
little
drier
which
is
nice
lingering
roasted
and
dark
malt
flavors
and
hints
of
lingering
pumpkin
not
really
any
late
spices
just
nice
rich
stout
almost
as
if
the
spices
disappeared
and
this
just
became
a
nice
creamy
dry
stout
again
i
remember
how
much
i
like
this
beer
dthis
one
is
damn
good
well
constructedenough
pumpkin
characteristics
injected
into
a
quality
stout
makes
for
an
impressive
brew
tasty
and
quaffable
a
very
nice
cold
season
beer
overall
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
stout
however
in
terms
of
being
a
pumpkin
stout
this
offering
is
on
the
weak
side
im
not
really
getting
any
pumpkin
flavor
and
the
spices
are
minimal
maybe
those
flavors
are
only
present
in
the
first
few
weeks
off
the
bottling
line
for
a
pumpkin
ale
i
prefer
it
to
some
lighter
versions
cape
ann
brewing
has
my
attention
easy
to
drink
interesting
take
but
i
really
wish
more
of
the
pumpkin
and
spice
would
come
through
t
tastes
like
a
stout
no
real
discernible
pumpkin
taste
smokey
heavy
maybe
in
the
aftertaste
theres
a
spicy
pumpkin
taste
but
its
slight
its
a
solid
beer
but
kind
of
seems
like
false
advertising
with
the
pumpkin
d
good
drinkability
a
perfect
blend
of
a
stout
and
pumpkin
flavor
combine
to
deliver
a
smooth
drinking
experience
2
or
3
should
fill
you
up
6
pack
worthy
and
solid
recommend
my
new
go
to
pumpkin
beer
for
that
chilly
october
night
around
the
campfire
overall
the
amount
of
pumpkin
is
just
right
taste
follows
the
same
path
a
watery
coffee
bean
flavor
lightly
roasted
malt
and
not
really
any
pumpkin
to
be
found
mediumlight
in

this
is
really
just
an
unimpressive
beer
overall
as
a
pumpkin
stout
it
would
probably
be
best
consumed
in
relativly
small
numbers
but
it
is
good
for
the
category
d
decent
although
the
depth
of
spices
as
in
most
pumpkins
is
just
too
much
to
really
enjoy
an
interesting
bottle
drinkability
while
it
doesnt
have
the
excitement
of
being
served
out
of
a
pumpkin
this
time
its
still
a
unique
and
delicious
stout
only
pumpkin
beer
ill
drink
other
than
the
smuttynose
once
again
the
stout
base
beer
really
helps
the
mouthfeel
its
not
creamy
but
substantial
enough
such
that
the
spices
and
pumpkin
dont
become
overwhelming
for
a
pumpkin
beer
this
has
great
drinkability
in
my
book
best
pumpkin
beer
i
have
tried
d
a
nice
effort
thanks
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
joe
12
ounce
bottle
no
freshness
info
offered
pours
darkest
of
browns
moderate
dark
mocha
head
and
more
then
just
bits
of
lace
left
behind
malty
roasty
malt
nose
tasty
stout
with
ample
roasted
malts
light
dark
chocolate
and
equally
light
pumpkin
notes
mostly
tasted
towards
the
finish
not
being
a
big
pumpkin
beer
fan
this
one
seemed
to
hit
the
right
note
on
the
amount
of
pumpkin
flavor
for
me
noticable
but
nowhere
near
overpowering
nice
fall
beer
goes
down
smooth
if
you
are
a
stout
and
pumpkin
fan
this
is
a
good
brew
to
try
all
around
a
solid
beer
i
like
the
heart
of
the
brewer
who
went
on
to
make
this
style
this
beer
had
my
name
written
all
over
it
when
i
saw
it
medium
body
carbonation
seems
to
be
a
bit
high
alcohol
is
well
hidden
i
like
the
idea
of
the
pumpkin
spices
going
along
with
a
nice
roasty
component
interesting
and
worth
trying
worth
trying
but
not
something
i
would
go
back
to
all
that
often
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
not
too
bubbly
but
not
incredibly
smooth
the
body
of
this
beer
is
bigger
than
most
pumpkin
stouts
and
it
works
well
in
this
beer
i
got
bored
of
this
beer
kind
of
quickly
and
i
was
over
it
about
halfway
through
i
can
see
a
pumpkin
stout
working
as
a
beer
but
it
wasnt
done
with
this
one
drinkability
overall
it
is
a
very
tasty
brew
and
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
very
drinkable
refreshing
and
a
good
take
on
the
style
drinkability
the
flavor
profile
did
not
do
it
for
me
slow
sipping
this
one
had
me
looking
for
another
style
before
i
finished
it
drinkability
a
wonderful
combination
of
a
stout
beer
and
pumpkin
this
i
believe
is
the
bestmost
interesting
pumpkin
beer
i
have
had
you
can
taste
way
more
than
just
pumpkin
spices
i
want
to
have
several
this
will
be
the
beer
i
look
forward
to
most
in
october
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
but
only
on
another
day
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
wants
a
mildy
pumpkin
brew
with
a
bittering
stout
profile
i
cant
drink
a
ton
of
fishermans
pumpkin
stout
to
be
honest
but
overall
its
a
beer
that
is
worth
trying
for
anyone
who
likes
stouts
and
is
looking
for
a
toneddown
pumpkin
beer
d
this
one
is
perfect
for
a
cold
autumn
night
i
would
have
never
guessed
it
is
6
75
abv
most
like
any
and
all
very
chilled
d
definitely
not
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
for
me
felt
like
i
was
drinking
an
autumn
yankee
candle
the
whole
time
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
wont
go
looking
for
too
many
pumpkin
beers
again
d
although
this
beer
is
a
completely
different
take
on
the
classin
pumpkin
ale
recipe
it
sits
sqarely
next
to
the
best
of
its
amberclass
counterparts
if
the
lighter
bodied
pumpkin
aleas
are
the
bridge
between
summer
and
fall
this
one
is
the
bridge
between
fall
and
winter
this
may
not
be
the
sexiest
looking
beer
but
its
very
enjoyable
and
will
be
a
most
welcome
addition
to
the
thanksgiving
and
christmas
dinner
table
this
is
good
stuff
and
definitely
a
pumpkin
ale
i
could
see
myself
coming
back
to
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
in
general
but
the
flavors
go
nicely
with
the
stout
poured
a
blackish
body
with
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
with
good
chocolate
malt
smell
as
well
as
roasted
malts
but
very
minor
on
the
pumpkin
spice
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
stout
although
much
more
of
a
stout
than
a
pumpkin
ale
which
i
was
expecting
a
sweet
taste
of
chocolate
permeates
through
a
lighttomedium
body
along
with
some
other
malts
like
caramel
and
sugariness
as
well
as
a
touch
of
pumpkin
in
the
beer
sort
of
a
mix
between
sweet
stout
and
pumpkin
and
while
not
a
typical
pumpkin
beer
available
in
october
a
very
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
shows
some
light
through
minimal
head
but
decent
kahki
lacing
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
pumpkin
puree
and
light
spicing
taste
is
80
stout
roasted
malts
and
20
pumpkin
puree
forward
with
minimal
spicing
a
little
lighter
than
a
typical
stout
but
very
creamy
very
good
unique
brew
lacks
just
a
little
more
umph
from
the
main
ingredients
of
roasted
malts
and
pumpkin
purchased
a
six
pack
at
walsh
in
brighton
center
poured
into
stemmed
glass
light
black
color
to
the
body
white
head
was
on
the
thin
side
smelled
a
bit
like
roasted
barley
with
a
hint
of
licorice
taste
was
very
nice
not
overpowering
pumpkin
ale
flavor
but
just
enough
in
the
background
of
this
beer
to
be
noticeable
more
stout
flavor
than
cinnamon
and
spice
the
only
gripe
i
would
have
with
this
beer
would
be
its
body
much
thinner
than
i
had
expected
for
a
pumpkin
stout
that
said
being
lighter
aided
its
drinkability
i
was
thinking
that
this
would
be
a
slow
sipping
beer
but
i
found
myself
done
quicker
than
i
thought
and
wanting
to
move
onto
another
this
beer
is
different
from
what
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
but
nevertheless
it
was
a
pleasure
to
finally
be
able
to
try
it
d
a
solid
beer
not
wowing
by
any
means
not
a
pumpkin
ale
in
the
classic
sense
12oz
bottle
purchased
at
tullys
in
wells
me
pours
a
pitch
black
body
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
brownred
highlights
and
nearly
an
inch
of
light
tan
shortlived
head
cinnamon
nutmeg
allspice
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
characterize
the
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
toffee
burnt
espressolike
and
dark
chocolatelike
malt
dominate
the
flavor
with
pumpkin
pie
spices
such
as
cinnamon
and
allspice
in
the
background
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
beer
not
sure
id
call
it
a
pumpkin
beer
as
such
more
of
a
robust
american
stout
with
some
pumpkin
pie
spice
to
make
it
interesting
in
any
case
a
really
good
beer
and
definitely
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
found
the
body
to
be
missing
something
maybe
on
account
of
being
a
stout
over
all
very
drinkable
and
should
enjoyable
by
most
of
not
all
take
your
time
very
nice
straightforward
seasonal
ale
going
light
on
the
pumpkin
a
good
casual
beer
to
pop
open
after
a
morning
raking
leaves
or
working
in
the
garden
medium
body
that
is
slightly
watered
down
and
not
as
thick
or
viscous
as
i
would
have
liked
roasted
chocolate
maltiness
with
hints
of
coffee
bean
burnt
toast
oatmeal
and
toffee
the
roasted
malty
flavors
dominated
making
this
beer
much
heavier
on
the
stout
side
than
the
pumpkinspicedherbvegetable
side
of
things
as
it
warms
the
pumpkin
spiciness
becomes
a
bit
more
evident
releasing
flavors
of
cinnamon
brown
sugar
and
pumpkin
but
the
roasted
malt
flavors
overpower
them
pours
very
dark
with
an
excellent
frothy
head
that
goes
nowhere
smells
of
pumpkin
allspice
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
initially
all
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
allspice
but
then
gives
way
to
a
nice
roastiness
and
fades
into
the
finish
marrying
each
other
fantastic
mouthfeel
is
typical
of
a
stout
maybe
a
little
thin
medium
dry
finish
extremely
drinkable
and
one
of
the
best
pumpkinspiced
beers
i
have
had
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
good
creamy
stout
base
with
a
balanced
addition
of
pumpkin
spiced
it
is
not
as
much
pumpkin
as
i
would
like
but
very
balanced
and
smooth
drinking
i
would
buy
this
again
with
no
major
complaints
a
nice
brew
and
i
think
one
of
the
first
times
ive
had
a
pumpkin
stout
jet
black
with
minimal
head
retention
and
lace
but
a
small
rim
of
tan
foam
around
the
edges
the
smell
is
pleasant
with
roasted
notes
taking
the
lead
and
some
pumpkinspice
lurking
in
the
background
the
pumpkin
flavor
comes
a
little
fuller
on
the
palate
with
maybe
some
nutmeg
and
a
little
bit
of
cinnamon
again
though
the
roasted
stout
qualities
are
dominant
i
get
the
sense
that
the
pumpkin
flavors
counterbalance
the
typical
stout
flavors
as
a
result
both
are
subdued
but
in
a
good
way
nice
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
that
has
some
palatesticking
qualities
this
has
been
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
so
far
mostly
because
it
tasted
less
like
pumpkin
pie
and
more
like
a
beer
maybe
something
like
dogfish
head
would
be
a
truer
expression
of
the
pumpkin
but
ill
take
a
beer
like
fishermans
stout
hopefully
other
brewers
will
steer
towards
more
balanced
flavors
like
cape
ann
has
all
around
i
could
have
used
more
robust
flavors
and
aromas
but
its
definitely
a
solid
beer
thats
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
no
pumking
but
will
stay
on
my
fall
roster
d
nice
flavor
but
a
lot
of
flavor
which
makes
you
slow
down
and
enjoy
it
in
the
world
of
pumpkin
beers
this
is
a
welcome
addition
due
to
its
new
to
me
take
on
the
style
easy
drinking
brew
i
found
the
drinkability
to
be
quite
nice
really
interesting
beer
overall
very
creative
and
a
really
nice
marriage
between
the
pumpkin
ale
and
the
stout
styles
d
drinkable
beer
because
it
is
watered
down
but
not
much
flavor
at
all
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
overall
perhaps
even
a
good
stout
it
scores
low
for
me
because
the
pumpkin
and
spice
tastes
arent
really
evident
poured
a
nice
clear
ruby
black
had
the
aroma
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
had
good
stout
taste
just
not
enough
pumpkin
flavor
for
me
decent
mouthfeel
and
a
good
enough
stout
to
have
session
with
the
body
is
equivalent
to
a
medium
bodied
stout
easy
drinking
with
little
to
no
cloying
until
the
third
beer
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
a
nice
fall
beer
pours
a
near
black
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
and
pumpkin
allspice
and
nutmeg
nice
subtle
pumpkin
aroma
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
light
stale
coffee
a
bitter
hop
and
finishes
with
a
light
pumpkin
flavor
nothing
special
a
solid
stout
with
light
pumpkin
in
the
end
full
body
with
soft
and
airy
carbonation
fairly
smooth
finishes
slightly
bitter
an
average
stout
the
stout
base
is
easy
to
drink
would
like
to
see
some
bolder
pumpkin
flavors
to
offset
the
roasted
malt
cheers
drinkability
overall
not
bad
at
all
not
the
most
potent
brew
ive
ever
had
but
i
certainly
did
enjoy
it
its
got
a
very
real
taste
and
its
a
nice
change
definitely
on
the
better
side
of
pumpkin
beers
thats
for
sure
thanks
adam
you
homo
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
brown
with
mahogany
highlights
a
nice
two
finger
rockey
offwhite
tannish
head
rests
on
top
receding
gradually
and
leaving
nice
lacing
sheets
on
the
glass
nose
is
of
roasted
malts
and
pumpkin
and
a
bit
of
nutmeg
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
coffee
notes
up
front
then
you
get
the
nutmegcinnamon
and
pumpkin
presence
medium
body
light
to
medium
carbonation
a
little
thin
on
the
tongue
but
not
distracting
this
one
leaves
quite
a
sweet
aftertaste
that
1
or
2
will
do
you
fast
crackling
burnt
biscuit
brown
head
reaches
two
fingers
tall
then
quickly
fades
to
a
half
inch
skim
it
slides
out
of
the
bottle
with
hints
of
brown
through
the
black
stream
settling
into
the
glass
with
only
brown
dots
that
peak
through
the
blackness
tones
of
pumpkin
bread
and
burnt
malt
make
up
a
solid
nose
pumpkin
feel
makes
only
a
brief
peek
as
you
first
take
the
initial
sip
you
do
get
a
nice
dose
of
roasty
malt
mixed
with
some
chocolate
spicy
coffee
and
vanilla
sweetens
a
bit
on
the
end
of
the
palate
and
shows
a
slight
dusting
of
spice
slightly
thick
mouthfeel
lovely
drinkability
for
the
style
without
being
overdone
d
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
pumpkin
ale
the
flavors
are
neither
artificial
nor
cloying
the
spices
are
present
but
dont
dominate
the
stout
is
solid
even
if
it
doesnt
knock
my
socks
off
d
this
beer
aint
bad
at
all
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
brews
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
with
that
said
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
it
has
a
light
sweetness
but
it
does
catch
up
with
you
as
you
polish
it
off
so
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
i
would
drink
another
at
a
different
session
has
some
nice
flavors
and
a
pretty
decent
balance
it
is
not
as
in
your
face
as
most
pumpkin
beers
and
i
dig
that
not
bad
if
you
like
pumpkin
brews
i
suggest
you
give
this
one
a
go
d
what
a
pleasant
surprise
this
is
perhaps
the
best
use
of
pumpkin
i
have
ever
tasted
in
a
beer
very
well
done
and
i
look
forward
to
more
d
for
me
a
fun
novelty
but
i
wouldnt
drink
a
6
pack
overall
a
medium
light
body
with
a
flat
mouth
feel
the
finish
is
light
and
doesnt
linger
the
beer
is
flat
and
taste
like
wet
cardboard
there
isnt
much
to
the
beer
the
nose
was
awesome
but
the
taste
left
me
wondering
it
is
just
an
okay
beer
i
poured
this
oddball
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
black
for
sure
with
a
dark
tan
head
a
low
head
the
beer
smelled
reall
good
if
you
like
pumpkin
pie
smell
very
spicey
it
has
a
slight
coffee
taste
but
the
pumpkin
spice
was
way
too
heavy
or
pronounced
i
will
not
buy
again
pours
a
very
dark
reddish
brown
verging
on
black
thick
light
tan
head
forms
drops
to
a
thick
ring
around
the
glass
and
thin
layer
some
lacing
sticks
to
the
glass
looks
pretty
nice
smell
is
neat
sweet
honey
brown
sugar
roast
pumpkin
chocolate
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
neat
spiciness
molasses
nice
interplay
between
the
pumpkin
and
roastbrown
sugar
nice
taste
is
similar
iron
caramel
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
raisins
light
fruitiness
chocolate
and
roast
some
sourness
toast
and
wheat
dry
in
the
finish
neat
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
spice
is
just
right
bit
of
sourness
is
a
bit
strange
after
a
while
and
the
flavour
is
slightly
weak
but
isnt
too
bad
thanks
russ
drinkability
is
low
between
the
high
bitterness
the
overuse
of
spices
and
the
thin
body
im
really
not
a
fan
of
this
one
and
had
trouble
even
getting
through
14
of
the
bottle
still
if
youre
a
fan
of
spices
you
might
appreciate
this
a
little
more
definitely
not
for
me
d
really
enjoyable
and
different
beer
couldnt
see
myself
having
more
than
one
but
a
nice
treat
thanks
ed
md
a
little
bit
more
carbonated
than
other
stouts
that
i
have
enjoyed
but
not
overcarbonated
the
lighter
texture
makes
this
beer
go
down
easy
however
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
a
big
enough
fan
of
the
beer
itself
to
want
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
one
sitting
this
definitely
works
better
if
you
go
into
it
expecting
a
pumpkin
beer
instead
of
a
novelty
stout
its
kind
of
hard
to
separate
the
two
aspects
of
it
though
it
has
a
chalky
roasty
aspect
from
a
stout
before
too
long
the
pumpkin
part
asserts
dominance
but
doesnt
completely
take
over
lightening
the
profile
a
bit
its
kind
of
comparable
to
weyerbachers
imperial
pumpkin
you
get
some
nice
pumpkin
flavor
without
the
gourd
overpowering
everything
spicing
is
kept
well
in
line
it
stays
out
of
the
body
and
mostly
manifests
itself
in
the
midend
palate
with
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
cleansing
im
not
a
fan
of
overly
spiced
beers
so
this
is
a
plus
mouthfeel
takes
a
bit
of
a
hit
because
it
could
definitely
stand
to
fill
out
a
little
more
its
like
theres
a
bit
of
a
hole
between
the
initial
stoutiness
and
the
later
pumpkineyness
where
there
should
be
some
transition
overall
mediumheavy
body
pretty
chewy
without
being
real
coating
it
slides
nicely
off
the
palate
could
use
a
little
more
of
a
stout
creaminess
to
it
all
of
the
different
factors
come
together
pretty
well
for
a
nice
drinkable
beer
its
not
my
most
favorite
thing
in
the
world
but
it
could
certainly
be
worse
ive
had
worse
pumpkin
beers
not
a
bad
beer
i
wish
it
was
a
big
bold
stout
with
some
pumpkin
spices
instead
its
a
decent
stout
with
lots
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
i
like
the
idea
though
the
two
should
go
hand
in
hand
very
well
d
stout
take
note
that
this
beer
is
not
nearly
as
thick
and
chewy
as
a
stout
but
does
have
the
darkness
and
similar
coffee
notes
a
very
good
season
pumpkin
beer
on
the
whole
id
drink
this
one
again
and
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
so
maybe
ill
enjoy
one
of
the
others
more
and
adjust
my
review
but
this
one
just
kind
of
fizzles
away
into
mediocrity
from
what
could
have
been
monumental
the
pumpkin
aspects
are
mediocre
and
the
stout
isnt
impressive
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
yeah
its
not
a
very
good
mix
but
im
glad
some
one
tried
it
could
be
great
if
done
right
just
horribly
balanced
no
real
stout
characteristics
to
it
like
drinking
an
alcoholic
pumpkin
pie
mix
pours
a
dark
blackish
brown
with
garnet
hues
in
light
two
fingers
of
foamy
burnt
tan
head
has
ok
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
pumpkin
seeds
chocolate
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
like
cinnamon
nutmeg
clove
and
ginger
tastes
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
light
caramel
sweetness
pumpkin
seeds
and
spices
like
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
that
linger
gently
in
the
finish
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
good
carbonation
smooth
and
creamy
with
good
roastiness
and
pumpkin
edge
a
good
balance
of
flavors
very
drinkable
and
hides
all
alcohol
quite
well
looking
forward
to
drinking
more
of
this
next
autumn
notes
from
10707
d
interesting
take
on
a
stout
the
heavier
body
of
a
stout
works
pretty
well
with
the
pumpkin
character
allowing
the
malt
to
balance
out
the
spiciness
a
bit
more
than
your
standard
pumpkin
ale
would
cape
ann
impressed
me
with
this
one
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
a
stout
brewed
with
pumpkin
spices
but
it
works
well
it
could
use
more
body
and
less
carbonation
thatd
be
a
slight
improvement
but
its
a
nice
beer
certainly
worth
checking
out
if
you
have
the
opportunity
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
and
fits
its
niche
within
the
style
well
although
its
a
decent
beer
im
not
a
big
enough
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
or
stouts
to
what
to
drink
this
beer
again

an
almost
black
color
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
that
faded
fast
smells
very
strong
of
pumpkin
spice
smells
just
like
a
pumkin
pie
taste
just
the
same
very
pumpkiny
med
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
drink
this
everyday
but
very
good
for
a
thanksgiving
or
christmas
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
powdery
texture
quite
filling
makes
a
great
dessert
beer
delicious
an
average
beer
in
my
opinion
drinks
very
easy
for
the
style
abv
this
is
among
the
best
for
this
style
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
somewhat
punchy
carbonation
that
races
across
the
palate
not
as
chewy
as
some
other
stouts
but
that
also
makes
it
a
bit
easier
to
drink
overall
i
enjoy
the
spiciness
of
a
pumpkin
beer
better
in
the
format
of
a
stout
or
porter
personally
and
wouldnt
mind
seeing
more
brews
like
this
wish
i
had
access
to
this
when
it
is
available
thanks
to
truh
for
leaving
me
this
bottle
overall
really
sold
beer
the
pumpkin
really
lends
itself
well
to
the
stout
especially
as
i
have
never
seen
or
heard
of
a
pumpkin
stout
before
this
i
believe
it
is
significantly
better
than
the
medium
amberbrown
ale
pumpkin
flavored
beers
i
hope
to
see
more
brewers
make
stabs
at
the
pumpkin
beer
and
be
creative
like
this
beer
the
taste
is
just
not
good
im
getting
a
bit
of
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
maybe
some
allspice
notes
up
front
and
some
roasted
stout
flavors
shortly
thereafter
but
the
blend
of
the
two
is
really
bad
i
dont
think
these
flavors
were
meant
to
go
together
the
result
is
a
slightly
acerbic
vinegary
unpleasantness
the
beer
is
also
quite
tasteless
even
pulling
apart
the
two
disparate
elements
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
alas
no
thanks
to
mikesgroove
and
kegatron
for
sending
one
of
these
for
the
nfl
survivor
lif
poured
into
samuel
smith
pint
glass
color
is
a
very
very
dark
brown
thin
light
brown
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
smells
of
pumpkin

spices
nutmeg
cloves
taste
is
dry
and
spicy
lots
of
clove
lots
of
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
feels
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
but
i
would
call
it
medium
bodied
long
dry
finish
with
some
hop
notes
lingering
roastysmoky
notes
pretty
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
a
neat
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
and
probably
the
best
thats
consistently
available
to
me
ill
pick
up
a
4pack
every
year
only
10
more
months
to
go
it
feels
smooth
and
a
tad
oily
a
solid
stout
with
some
sweet
balance
the
pumpkin
overshadows
but
the
chalky
stout
malt
balances
an
interesting
mixture
of
the
stout
with
pumpkin
taste
wasnt
too
sure
what
it
would
be
like
because
i
like
to
look
at
the
reviews
after
i
try
it
i
would
say
its
well
balanced
out
with
the
stout
and
pumpkin
tastes
neither
really
overpowers
the
other
which
i
would
imagine
is
what
they
were
going
for
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
but
its
still
a
good
beer
drinkability
not
too
heavy
with
the
pumpkin
doing
better
here
with
the
stout
flavors
than
most
of
the
straight
up
ale
varieties
which
either
seem
to
be
pieinabottle
or
regular
brew
with
a
bit
of
pumpkin
spice
flavorful
and
a
bit
different
especially
for
a
stout
i
was
impressed
with
the
balance
of
this
brew
and
id
recommend
it
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
both
types
of
brew
high
drinkability
factor
here
especially
since
this
is
almost
7
abv
and
i
cant
even
detect
it
at
all
in
the
taste
nice
smooth
and
tasty
d
very
nice
low
bodied
stout
with
some
spices
good
seasonal
brew
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
usually
hate
pumpkin
beers
i
was
shown
by
another
brewery
that
it
is
possible
to
make
a
great
pumpkin
ale
this
one
wasnt
along
those
lines
it
started
off
with
a
beautiful
appearance
but
it
then
went
down
hill
from
there
it
needed
to
increase
the
kick
of
the
spices
a
little
bit
and
add
a
lot
more
pumpkin
to
it
next
time
please
dont
roast
the
pumpkin
and
then
water
it
down
on
a
positive
note
i
would
choose
this
pumpkin
ale
over
a
ton
of
those
other
pumpkin
ales
i
see
sitting
on
the
stores
shelves
i
liked
this
the
body
seemed
a
bit
light
for
a
stout
but
the
roasted
chocolate
malts
and
spices
really
worked
well
together
im
going
to
have
to
drink
a
couple
more
of
these
on
thanksgiving
with
some
pumpkin
pie
pours
dark
with
minimal
head
smell
is
nice
and
sweet
cinnamon
clove
notes
of
pumpkin
pie
some
roasted
malt
but
dominated
by
the
pumpkin
sweetness
tastes
wonderful
the
roasted
malt
and
sweetness
paired
with
the
pumpkin
results
with
something
similar
to
sweet
potato
casserole
a
wonderful
beer
for
the
thanksgiving
holiday
mouthfeel
is
thin
yet
coating
very
enjoyable
and
plenty
drinkable
even
with
the
sweetness
dominating
thanks
corey
an
interesting
brew
that
is
pumpkiny
with
a
stout
character
that
blends
well
the
alcohol
is
very
wellhidden
though
the
spiciness
is
enough
for
me
to
be
happy
having
one
or
two
at
most
at
a
time
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
i
was
fairly
impressed
slightly
light
for
a
stout
but
overall
good
sixer
from
whole
foods
vienna
va
having
just
come
off
the
pumpkin
beer
season
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
pumpkin
stout
as
it
poured
into
my
glass
i
could
smell
the
pumpkin
spices
from
an
arms
length
away
the
appearance
was
a
nice
dark
color
but
you
could
see
some
light
through
it
the
head
was
barely
1
finger
and
dissipated
quickly
one
sip
into
this
brew
and
the
battle
between
the
dark
malts
and
the
pumpkin
spices
began
across
my
tastebuds
i
relished
in
the
choclate
and
coffee
flavors
and
they
easily
won
out
over
the
pumpkin
spices
but
they
did
not
die
out
entirely
the
spicey
flavors
stick
around
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
only
some
slight
carbonation
sting
i
like
stouts
and
would
drink
this
next
to
the
fire
but
im
not
sold
on
the
combination
i
like
my
pumpkin
spices
in
ales
and
pies
overall
not
bad
not
my
favorite
of
the
year
here
but
overall
not
bad
i
would
not
turn
my
nose
up
at
this
one
anytime
soon
note
my
2009
experience
did
not
live
up
to
prior
year
im
not
sure
if
its
a
tap
vs
bottle
2008
vs
2009
or
a
combinatin
of
both
but
i
found
the
current
offering
to
be
thinner
and
more
dominated
by
spices
than
pumpkin
i
have
slightly
decreased
by
ratings
as
a
result
drinkability
a
very
interesting
brew
indeed
while
the
smell
was
awesome
the
other
categories
seemed
to
fall
a
bit
short
i
was
hoping
this
would
put
me
in
the
thanksgiving
mood
but
alas
i
just
feel
a
little
buzzed
i
enjoyed
it
overall
and
would
drink
it
again
but
not
sure
its
something
id
go
too
far
out
of
my
way
to
find
drinkability
is
okay
i
was
splitting
this
bottle
with
my
girlfriend
and
we
finished
i
no
problem
and
i
wouldnt
really
mind
having
another
but
only
if
it
was
already
paid
for
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
though
i
might
try
to
make
a
pumpkin
stout
for
next
fall
good
idea
but
it
falls
short
pick
it
up
if
you
are
really
in
the
mood
for
a
pumpkin
beer
but
dont
go
looking
for
this
one
drinkability
this
one
was
pretty
good
a
nice
solid
pumpkin
stout
and
better
than
a
lot
of
pumpkin
ales
generally
that
ive
had
this
season
the
abv
is
reasonable
wellhidden
and
its
tasty
without
being
over
the
top
a
great
goto
beer
try
this
one
d
it
would
be
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
this
was
an
interesting
and
enjoyable
hybrid
beer
while
the
appearance
gave
the
illusion
that
this
beer
was
going
to
be
stoutlike
both
the
nose
and
the
palate
were
far
more
similar
to
that
of
a
pumpkin
ale
that
said
the
flavors
in
this
beer
melded
quite
well
with
each
other
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
more
breweries
started
experimenting
with
a
beer
that
was
similar
to
this
unique
fall
offering
drinkability
is
great
could
see
myself
having
this
for
many
years
i
let
the
growler
sit
on
the
counter
for
a
good
hour
before
pouring
the
second
tasting
and
it
really
opened
this
beer
up
especially
that
crazy
vegetal
character
you
get
from
the
pumpkin
id
recommend
drinking
this
as
warm
as
you
can
stand
it
and
id
recommend
the
beer
as
a
whole
heartily
this
and
smuttynoses
contributions
are
so
far
my
favorites
in
the
style
bottle
from
jjpm74
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
has
a
nice
brown
head
that
slowly
diminishes
into
a
smallish
ring
lively
carbonation
and
decent
lacing
aroma
is
spice
and
pumpkin
flavor
is
quite
spicy
too
and
has
loads
of
pumpkin
there
is
a
kind
of
weird
aftertaste
but
it
isnt
bad
just
a
little
thin
very
nice
brew
pours
black
with
a
tan
head
nose
is
all
spices
but
not
really
overpowering
flavor
is
a
mild
mix
of
spices
pumpkin
and
stout
character
honestly
i
was
expecting
a
thicker
profile
and
just
more
pumpkin
than
what
was
delivered
i
think
the
dark
horse
blueberry
stout
has
spoiled
me
feel
is
okay
buts
but
thin
on
liquid
lower
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
attempt
at
an
unusual
combination
i
think
if
it
were
thicker
it
could
go
a
lot
farther
overall
this
was
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
it
worked
really
well
i
would
recommend
i
like
this
beer
i
think
the
pumpkin
addition
adds
a
great
accompaniment
too
the
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
not
much
in
the
way
of
classic
pumpkin
pie
spices
but
more
of
just
a
pumpkin
puree
flavor
creamy
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
to
drink
not
huge
and
complex
but
very
nice
and
i
love
the
idea
wish
more
breweries
would
use
pumpkin
in
different
beer
styles
a
dark
black
appearance
with
a
slight
burnt
orange
color
in
the
light
aromas
had
a
very
slight
pumpkin
spice
punch
to
it
more
of
a
general
stout
smell
with
malts
and
cocoa
flavors
the
beer
sadly
for
me
lacks
the
pumpkin
flavoring
i
sensed
from
its
aromas
more
generally
stoutcentered
though
and
it
is
a
decent
stout
at
that
but
since
i
was
hoping
for
something
with
a
little
more
pumpkin
flavoring
i
am
going
to
go
low
on
that
score
mouthfeel
maintained
a
good
crispness
while
still
allowing
a
slight
cream
aspect
to
the
drink
overall
a
really
good
stout
just
wish
it
had
more
pumpkin
notes
i
was
wicked
excited
when
someone
described
this
as
a
mix
of
breakfast
stout
and
pumpking
sadly
this
is
not
what
comes
to
mind
notes
very
well
done
i
will
look

to
this
again

a
nice
beer
from
my
friend
jeremy
at
cape
ann
brewing
and
instantly
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
pnkermizoct
22
pours
a
deep
orange
with
an
eggshell
white
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
bit
more
reserved
than
i
thought
it
would
be
there
was
some
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
but
not
as
much
as
i
thought
there
would
be
the
taste
was
great
with
a
lot
of
pumpkin
flavor
up
front
and
then
spices
such
as
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
i
think
cardamom
come
through
really
liked
this
one
o
a
better
than
average
imperial
pumpkin
beer
im
not
a
fan
of
this
much
sweet
or
fruit
or
spice
its
like
flavored
coffee
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
though
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
spicy
for
my
palate
very
enjoyable
and
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
pours
a
cloudy
medium
amber
brown
wiith
a
large
persistent
white
head
from
a
growler
supplied
by
cjs
in
towamencin
pa
aroma
is
pleasant
aromatic
mostly
vanilla
with
some
definite
pumpkin
pie
notes
taste
is
very
smooth
malty
and
easy
drinking
there
is
not
much
pumpkin
or
spice
but
a
subtle
complex
mixture
of
all
of
the
above
not
as
intense
as
the
neshaminy
creek
imperial
pumpkin
punkless
dunkel
but
nevertheless
quite
good
and
very
sessionable
this
delicious
brew
will
please
the
palates
of
all
but
the
most
experienced
beer
drinkers
who
have
destroyed
their
palates
with
overthetop
insanely
intense
brews
great
taste
smooth
going
down
a
surprisingly
good
brew
from
river
horse
i
actually
liked
this
the
alcohol
well
hidden
a
lot
of
fresh
pumpkin
flavor
with
less
pumpkin
spice
a
little
sweetness
creamy
smooth
feel
and
dry
spicy
finish
poured
cold
into
the
pint
glass
this
seasonal
shows
a
nice
autumnal
rusty
caramel
brown
with
a
respectable
white
sheet
of
foam
on
top
and
solid
streaks
of
lacing
the
aroma
offers
a
yeasty
allspice
and
nutmeg
medley
with
hints
of
orange
and
clove
nice
the
flavor
comes
on
pretty
strong
with
grassy
grain
pumpkin
and
more
allspice
unfortunately
my
one
gripe
with
this
beer
is
that
alcohol
is
more
evident
in
the
flavor
than
id
like
i
appreciate
that
its
an
imperial
a
misnomer
outside
the
russian
stout
family
and
many
of
my
favorite
brews
are
high
alcohol
but
alcohol
in
itself
should
not
be
a
flavor
it
doesnt
ruin
this
beer
for
me
but
it
does
make
this
a
bit
disappointing
like
the
aroma
i
pick
up
some
clove
and
citrus
notes
as
well
as
brown
bread
malt
and
caramel
the
body
is
medium
at
best
and
with
a
peppery
carbonation
theres
a
slightly
creamy
but
tingly
feel
good
for
a
bit
of
fall
pleasure
but
short
of
expectations
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
developed
a
nice
cream
colored
head
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
appaerance
was
a
very
hazy
amber
to
orange
color
aroma
had
strong
notes
of
spice
and
in
particular
nutmeg
tasted
of
spice
and
hop
nice
floral
nutmeg
and
clove
notes
nice
full
and
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
spicy
and
lingering
aftertaste
odone
of
the
better
pumpkin
brews
i
tried
this
season
i
wouldnt
be
shocked
if
i
revisited
a
4pack
of
this
next
fall
d
a
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
and
by
far
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
river
horse
to
date
ive
been
a
tad
disappointed
in
their
other
offerings
the
end
result
is
a
solid
much
better
than
average
but
a
tad
bit
short
of
top
of
class
pumpkin
ale
im
happy
to
have
encountered
and
will
gladly
invest
in
a
4
pack
each
holiday
season
when
im
able
to
find
it
on
the
shelves
i
picked
this
up
as
an
alternative
to
sam
adams
harvest
pumpkin
which
has
been
completely
sold
out
for
over
3
weeks
now
at
the
bk
in
chatham
nj
not
as
much
body
as
the
sam
but
it
is
very
good
just
a
tad
too
thin
imo
and
it
was
this
or
captain
lawrence
pumpkin
which
ive
had
before
and
it
sahx
a
cawk
nonetheless
serving
the
river
horse
pumpkin
in
a
chilled
glass
is
a
nice
fall
treat
get
some
while
you
can
nice
pumpkin
ale
little
more
on
the
brown
ale
side
of
things
cant
really
taste
the
booze
but
certaiinly
can
feel
it
o
one
of
the
more
successful
imperial
pumpkins
ive
had
this
season
in
regards
to
balance
not
overly
cloying
in
any
way
well
done
river
horse
overall
one
of
the
most
pumpkinesque
experiences
out
there
fresh
and
vegetal
a
brownish
murky
brew
with
lots
of
haze
and
a
modest
ofwhite
head
the
beer
is
interesting
but
not
beautiful
the
smell
is
spicy
but
not
overdone
pie
spice
instead
it
is
a
bit
peppery
the
vegetable
pumpkin
scent
comes
out
a
little
but
never
fully
developers
it
hides
its
alcohol
well
mild
warming
but
it
stayed
hidden
at
the
start
semi
sweet
the
beer
relies
on
spice
and
a
lightly
roasted
flavor
the
body
is
full
and
spice
really
comes
out
in
the
finish
i
really
enjoyed
it
more
and
more
as
i
worked
through
the
bottle
very
good
again
my
friend
and
i
compared
this
to
6
other
imperial
pumpkins
and
found
this
beers
texture
not
flavor
unique
to
the
point
of
enhansing
the
pumpkin
beer
experience
they
all
have
pumpkin
flavor
but
the
creamyness
seems
to
set
it
apart
in
a
nice
way
overall
this
is
a
real
good
beer
for
having
an
abv
over
8
this
beer
is
dangerously
smooth
perfect
for
the
fall
id
totally
buy
this
again
fall
gets
off
with
a
bang
first
pumpkin
of
the
year
and
this
one
nails
it
pours
dark
copper
amber
with
fast
bubbles
and
no
foam
cinnamon
pumpkin
nose
brown
sugar
taste
is
a
rich
pumpkin
spices
bready
pumpkin
pie
mouthfeel
really
good
pours
a
amber
tinted
orange
fluffy
and
soapy
white
head
light
scent
moderately
spicy
with
some
underlying
sweetness
not
much
pumpkin
taste
begins
with
spice
and
bitterness
some
pumpkin
comes
through
and
a
mesh
of
vanilla
and
sugar
hinted
at
on
the
back
end
medium
bodied
falls
in
the
category
of
pumpkin
ales
that
are
more
about
the
spice
than
the
pumpkin
or
pie
overall
an
above
average
to
average
pumpkin
beer
and
certainly
slightly
below
other
imperial
pumpkin
ales
a
good
deal
of
dry
malt
and
cinnamon
here
not
bad
but
i
will
look
for
other
pumpkin
ales
first
it
pours
a
murkey
brown
color
body
with
a
thin
tannish
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
little
bit
then
fades
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
of
pumpkin
flesh
and
cinnamon
the
taste
is
very
nice
of
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
and
other
spices
the
spices
are
not
over
powering
just
balanced
really
well
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
leaves
a
nice
after
taste
of
spices
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
really
good
pumpkin
beers
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
this
year
o
this
is
one
of
the
nicer
pumpkins
this
season
the
overall
flavor
is
pleasing
and
the
rich
complexity
makes
it
very
enjoyable
sip
after
sip
river
horse
has
recently
been
very
consistent
with
the
quality
and
complexity
of
their
beers
worth
a
sip
o
overall
i
think
the
alcohol
seems
to
interfere
to
much
with
the
pumpkin
aspect
of
the
drink
a
pumpkin
beer
should
be
fun
spicy
enjoyable
to
drink
while
most
of
that
is
distracted
by
the
heat
of
going
big
im
all
for
big
alcohol
beers
i
just
dont
think
a
pumpkin
beer
is
a
good
option
where
the
sweet
and
spicy
nature
is
muted
not
ideal
for
multiples
i
rather
a
pumpkin
beer
i
can
casually
enjoy
around
a
campfire
out
in
the
woods
where
the
campfire
will
keep
me
warm
not
so
much
alcohol
and
where
the
flavor
a
bit
more
enjoyable
and
defined
o
not
really
impressed
but
its
definitely
decent
very
drinkable
for
the
style
four
of
these
would
definitely
fuck
you
up
worth
it
if
you
can
find
it
in
singles
though
overall
decent
beer
overall
have
had
plenty
of
other
better
pumpkin
ales
than
this
still
pretty
solid
and
id
definitely
drink
it
again
a
nice
change
for
a
pumpkin
beer
still
has
spices
but
drinks
more
like
a
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
river
horse
beers
i
ever
drank
and
even
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
i
drank
this
season
worth
seeking
out
if
a
fan
of
the
style
o
this
beer
has
very
good
flavors
and
hides
the
fairly
high
abv
well
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
definitely
one
to
pick
up
again
next
fall
overall
actually
a
very
enjoyable
beer
when
this
came
highly
recommended
i
was
sure
it
wouldnt
be
a
letdown
this
was
a
beer
that
can
be
thoroughly
enjoyed
slowly
by
a
nice
bonfire
i
would
be
careful
after
consuming
one
haha
well
i
will
have
this
again
during
a
long
session
football
game
or
bsn
with
the
guys
and
i
would
totally
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
would
ask
side
note
taste
and
mouthfeel
so
much
better
from
tap
this
is
one
of
the
best
pumkins
ive
had
after
the
big
two
great
beer
d
definitely
doesnt
drink
like
an
imperial
pumpkin
even
if
the
abv
says
different
the
spice
is
overwhelmed
while
the
pumpkin
flavor
doesnt
really
show
its
head
ummmm
i
say
pass
overall
you
are
drinking
a
good
beer
and
might
just
sneak
into
my
top
five
pumpkins
that
i
have
had
this
season
right
after
a
cheesecake
even
better
salud
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
you
can
do
much
worse
but
there
are
some
better
options
out
there
so
choose
carefully
o
overall
i
really
like
this
imperial
you
dont
find
one
flavor
prodomanitly
taking
over
another
like
in
other
pumking
ales
the
flavors
are
definitely
present
but
in
no
way
dominate
which
make
this
imperial
very
drinkable
herbal
spicy
hop
flavors
up
front
spices
make
their
presence
known
and
stay
for
a
bit
cookie
and
graham
cracker
malt
sweetness
fills
up
the
palate
clove
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
feature
prominently
in
the
finish
slight
spicy
bitterness
lingers
along
with
a
hearty
dose
of
pulpy
piey
malt
mediumfull
body
with
a
creamy
feel
not
bad
but
there
are
better
imperial
pumpkin
ales
oa
decent
and
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
but
not
as
wellbalanced
as
some
others
i
love
this
beer
it
doesnt
have
n
overwhelming
pumpkin
pie
taste
to
it
at
all
like
most
tendto
have
i
got
a
case
of
short
fills
brought
them
home
encouraged
my
parents
to
drink
them
sooner
rather
to
later
took
2
four
packs
out
of
the
case
for
a
party
left
the
state
for
5
days
and
came
home
to
only
2
bottles
left
its
just
that
good
12
oz
bottle
from
traders
joe
pours
hazy
brown
with
a
short
lived
offwhite
head
and
lively
carbonation
nose
reminds
me
of
belgian
sour
red
also
some
spices
caramel
malt
hints
of
cacao
body
is
full
and
tangy
taste
is
some
pumpkin
spices
herbal
hops
brown
sugar
and
caramel
finish
is
long
and
very
spicy
nice
brew
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
with
a
river
horse
beer
m
d
its
among
the
first
page
of
heavy
hitters
as
far
as
alcohol
goes
at
time
of
review
the
alcohol
sits
fairly
well
behind
a
pretty
solid
flavour
profile
and
drinks
remarkably
smooth
a
welldone
beer
and
one
that
will
certainly
have
me
more
interested
in
trying
out
other
river
horse
offerings
in
the
future
solid
not
must
have
overall
as
someone
that
has
had
almost
every
solid
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
thats
ever
been
brewed
this
one
is
slightly
unbalanced
a
bit
boozy
and
forgetable
overall
would
have
better
with
less
abv
and
less
spice
additions
probably
o
this
may
be
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
i
will
soon
be
traveling
to
the
nearby
river
horse
brewery
to
enjoy
this
on
tap
i
went
with
a
gentle
pour
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
lees
and
as
such
i
got
only
wisps
for
head
color
was
an
ohsoslightly
hazy
orangishamber
nose
smelled
strongly
of
cloves
and
cinnamon
even
a
candylike
sweetness
like
taffy
unusual
mouthfeel
was
slightly
viscous
and
the
taste
was
very
much
like
pumpkin
pie
really
spicy
in
terms
of
the
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
cloves
on
the
tongue
and
coupled
with
the
alcohol
heat
this
was
a
beer
to
be
reckoned
with
finish
allowed
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
pumpkin
puree
to
make
an
appearance
whew
i
liked
it
but
it
is
a
beer
to
be
reckoned
with
easily
consumed
from
a
roosterfish
pint
glass
being
a
pumpkin
beer
this
one
could
only
be
considered
during
the
right
season
this
style
is
really
not
my
preference
but
river
horse
seems
to
have
done
it
well
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
nectary
and
floral
aromas
which
helped
keep
things
light
the
cidery
qualities
were
nice
as
well
but
the
souring
was
uncalled
for
they
should
have
either
gone
for
it
completely
with
the
bitters
and
sours
or
not
at
all
it
left
a
bizarre
muddled
feel
to
the
flavor
additionally
the
beer
was
horribly
flat
making
the
mouthfeel
none
too
exciting
o
mellow
and
drinkable
nice
spice
note
but
low
on
pumpkin
flavor
big
thanks
goes
out
to
the
ba
who
sent
me
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
past
trade
dont
have
my
spreadsheet
at
home
served
from
bottle
into
a
samuel
smith
imperial
pint
poured
a
dark
redorange
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
pumpkin
spices
cinnamon
ginger
alcohol
and
subtle
nutmeg
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
subtle
alcohol
pumpkin
cinnamon
subtle
nutmeg
and
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
have
grown
to
like
pumpkin
brews
more
and
more
and
this
one
is
a
good
example
of
why
the
pumpkin
definitely
dominated
the
flavor
and
aroma
on
this
one
while
doing
so
it
brought
a
nice
collection
of
spices
to
the
game
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
a
definite
must
try
for
the
curious
or
pumpkin
brew
fan
alike
overall
impression
now
this
one
breaks
into
my
top
5
list
maybe
i
enjoy
these
high
gravityimperial
pumpkin
ales
much
more
but
how
could
you
blame
me
these
ones
have
the
punch
of
pumpkin
and
spice
while
the
lower
abv
pumpkin
ales
only
have
sweetness
and
malt
that
fill
out
the
entire
tastemouthfeel
i
would
definitely
get
your
hands
on
this
one
if
you
get
a
chance
cant
even
notice
it
is
a
8
1
brew
not
a
bad
pumpkin
clove
cinnamon
nutmeg
all
spice
and
squash
good
malt
character
nice
and
bready
with
toffee
and
hints
of
caramel
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
creamy
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
but
its
not
setting
and
records
smells
like
pumpkin
pie
or
butternut
squash
cake
body
was
ruddy
orange
with
tanbeige
head
head
lasts
it
laces
glass
well
tastes
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
a
nice
bite
to
it
interesting
i
always
think
the
bigger
versions
have
way
more
upside
this
one
may
cellar
for
a
few
years
going
down
great
on
a
fairly
cold
october
afternoon
in
okieland
good
to
see
a
decent
offering
from
these
guys
started
slow
but
came
on
my
previous
encounter
was
pretty
underwhelming
o
this
is
an
impressive
beer
that
was
rather
good
one
of
the
better
ones
that
has
been
a
stand
out
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
i
liked
this
offering
by
river
horse
it
is
the
first
offering
by
that
brewery
that
i
really
enjoyed
o
pretty
well
representative
of
the
style
just
a
little
bitter
and
overspiced
for
a
pumpkin
ale
imo
o
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
nice
job
river
horse
nice
to
have
another
good
brewery
in
jersey
overall
well
done
pumpkin
ale
and
the
age
hasnt
significantly
hurt
this
that
being
said
this
one
is
just
a
bit
light
on
actual
pumpkin
ale
flavours
it
tastes
more
like
an
imperial
golden
ale
with
just
a
hint
of
pumpkin
pie
not
bad
but
not
as
pumpkinforward
as
i
like
o
not
one
of
my
favorite
october
beers
but
this
one
was
not
to
bad
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
slightly
hazy
burnt
orange
with
a
finger
or
so
of
frothy
white
head
that
left
some
nice
lacing
aroma
of
malty
sweetness
with
light
pumpkin
and
spices
taste
of
caramel
sweet
malts
toasted
grains
with
an
adequate
nonoverblown
infusion
of
pumpkin
pie
i
prefer
my
pumpkin
ales
to
have
a
big
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
but
this
was
still
sufficient
medium
mouthfeel
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
and
generally
drinkable
this
one
is
a
must
try
if
you
enjoy
imperial
pumpkin
ales
much
more
drinkable
than
pumking
as
its
not
the
least
bit
cloying
this
beer
is
hot
with
alcohol
notes
and
while
not
undrinkable
its
not
really
all
that
pleasant
certaintly
not
easy
drinking
and
not
the
greatest
pumpkin
beer
out
there
this
season
very
well
rounded
well
balanced
beer
sweet
spicy
and
bitter
none
of
which
overwhelm
or
last
long
in
the
mouth
either
an
awesome
autumn
drinker
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
orangebrown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
like
fresh
pumpkin
pie
taste
is
good
pumpkin
nutmeg
very
flavorfull
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
pours
a
dark
and
cloudy
orange
with
a
half
finger
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
toffee
is
dominant
in
the
nose
but
not
noticeable
in
the
taste
the
taste
has
a
cider
flavor
up
front
and
really
lacks
any
pumpkin
this
is
not
terribly
heavy
but
it
is
not
an
easy
drinking
beer
either
the
alcohol
is
not
overwhelming
but
it
is
present
more
so
than
in
other
imperial
pumpkins
id
recommend
several
other
imperial
pumpkins
before
this
one
notes
not
a
bad
offering
overall
but
for
me
a
bit
too
sweet
other
than
that
the
balance
between
pumpkin
and
spice
has
a
nice
rhythm
and
potential
overall
this
is
a
milder
better
balanced
southern
tier
pumpking
in
true
river
horse
fashion
nothing
too
aggressive
here
just
a
solid
addition
to
the
fall
beer
field
the
note
on
the
label
says
nobody
likes
a
showoff
well
mission
accomplished
there
i
dont
particularly
care
for
overspiced
beers
if
this
werent
labelled
as
an
imperial
and
the
alcohol
cut
back
a
bit
i
would
have
been
more
impressed
o
to
me
this
is
a
fairly
standard
beer
for
people
who
dont
want
the
artificial
pumpkin
taste
this
might
be
a
good
bet
i
think
river
horse
does
a
good
job
of
accurately
creating
a
pumpkin
ale
but
its
nothing
spectacular
very
nice
effort
by
river
horse
a
fine
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
i
think
whats
holding
this
one
back
a
little
is
the
faintness
of
the
aromas
and
palate
it
should
stand
out
a
little
better
without
the
drinker
putting
effort
to
taste
and
savor
nonetheless
a
worthy
addition
to
the
style
the
best
brew
from
river
horse
i
have
had
a
great
pumpkin
brew
overall
river
horse
seems
to
have
missed
the
mark
with
this
one
while
pumpkin
meat
and
spices
do
appear
in
the
beer
its
overpowered
by
a
very
malt
liquorlike
alcohol
hotness
that
is
distracting
and
honestly
unpleasant
update
i
tasted
this
side
by
side
with
the
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
and
i
was
wrong
weyerbacher
is
still
the
king
of
pumpkin
ales
in
my
book
river
horse
comes
in
second
medium
short
finish
without
cloying
good
carbonation
a
nice
beer
but
not
one
that
shouts
pumpkin
at
all
tastes
of
spice
on
the
palate
are
dominated
by
a
pleasant
booziness
only
reappearing
briefly
in
the
finish
overall
well
made
and
tasty
really
good
pumpkin
with
decent
alcohol
content
it
is
a
sipper
unless
you
want
to
get
buzzed
quick
and
if
that
is
the
case
just
do
a
pumpkin
bomb
great
dessert
beer
with
a
slice
of
pie
or
some
ice
cream
most
of
the
river
horse
beers
are
good
and
this
is
no
exception
o
this
beer
is
very
flavorful
and
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
considering
the
strength
i
would
definitely
consider
having
this
one
again
its
very
good
but
a
step
or
two
below
weyerbachers
imperial
pumpkin
poured
a
copperbrownorangey
color
with
a
creamtannish
colored
head
about
half
an
inch
heavily
carbonated
smell
was
pumpkin
pie
mostly
cloves
faint
pureed
pumpkin
taste
was
nice
and
wellbalanced
alcohol
coming
through
giving
a
slightly
sour
flavor
at
times
heavy
on
the
sugary
malts
and
cardamom
all
spice
great
flavors
nice
pumpkin
ale
here
this
was
awesome
but
not
the
best
i
have
had
definitely
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
had
but
also
not
bad
drinkable
but
there
are
definitely
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
overall
very
solid
fall
beer
cant
wait
to
have
more
of
it
o
not
a
good
aroma
or
flavor
pretty
bad
pumpkin
beer
overall
not
too
good
not
too
bad
if
you
are
looking
for
a
decent
4pack
of
a
imperial
pumkin
it
is
worth
a
try
a
bit
too
bitter
up
front
for
the
style
pumpkin
flavors
are
weak
i
would
skip
this
one
and
get
the
southern
tier
pumking
if
you
truly
want
to
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
in
a
tastier
more
balanced
form
ogood
imp
pumpkin
ale
doesnt
sit
heavy
on
the
stomach
and
can
be
enjoyed
through
out
the
night
like
that
it
features
more
earthiness
of
pumpkin
rather
than
the
sweet
pumpkin
pie
flavor
overall
great
beer
totally
will
buy
it
again
well
done
rh
cheers
final
thoughts
a
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
ill
be
buying
more
when
the
leaves
are
falling
to
the
ground
thumbs
up
river
horse
o
better
than
your
average
pumpkin
ale
nose
and
mouthfeel
are
exceptional
great
pumpkin
flavors
good
use
of
spices
and
an
excellent
balance
theres
only
some
slight
booze
apparent
which
vanishes
quickly
this
pumpkin
ale
pours
out
as
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
yellowish
tan
head
the
head
fizzles
away
leaving
behind
just
a
fee
clumps
on
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
is
spicy
and
sweet
smelling
the
flavor
of
the
beer
doesnt
really
scream
imperial
to
me
i
found
that
the
flavor
was
pretty
much
like
any
other
regular
pumpkin
ale
the
spices
kick
in
right
from
the
get
go
and
the
pumpkin
is
subtle
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
has
a
bite
to
it
not
a
bad
brew
d
despite
being
9
abv
hippolantern
drinks
far
more
smoothly
than
it
should
theres
still
a
bit
of
a
let
down
in
terms
of
authentic
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
but
its
pretty
maltforward
with
a
bit
of
hop
and
specialty
malt
bitterness
i
had
a
couple
with
ease
and
probably
will
again
next
year
d
not
recommended
one
of
the
poorer
showings
that
night
d
good
stuff
here
for
sure
yep
id
drink
this
one
again
for
sure
good
stuff
from
river
horse
drinkability
not
bad
almost
an
old
alecumpumpkin
ale
rich
and
fruity
malt
flavor
with
gentle
spicing
and
adequate
pumpkin
character
one
of
my
personal
favorites
of
the
style
honestly
my
only
quip
is
the
alcohol
presence
while
not
terribly
offensive
it
should
be
really
toned
down
for
the
style
d
this
was
a
nice
surprise
i
did
not
know
river
horse
had
a
pumpkin
ale
so
i
grabbed
this
one
not
as
good
as
weyerbachers
imperial
pumpkin
but
its
a
nice
imperial
pumpkin
ale
d
its
not
exactly
a
chore
to
drink
but
its
certainly
much
boozier
than
it
needs
to
be
this
one
has
too
much
alcohol
and
not
enough
of
what
really
counts
in
a
pumpkin
beer
pumpkin
and
spice
there
is
some
room
to
make
this
an
awesome
beer
though
one
extra
note
allow
this
beer
to
warm
up
to
just
above
cellar
temperature
as
this
will
take
the
edge
off
the
alcohol
and
increase
the
depth
of
the
smell
and
taste
great
job
river
horse
d
its
a
decent
tasting
beer
but
the
higher
abv
makes
it
a
one
and
done
beer
d
good
but
the
alcohol
hurts
it
a
little
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
could
be
smoother
and
it
gets
a
little
thinner
as
it
warms
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
pumpkin
ale
from
the
folks
down
the
road
at
river
horse
taking
a
sip
of
hoppolantern
and
it
tastes
great
it
has
an
emphasize
on
spice
malt
is
also
prevalent
and
sweet
but
not
overboard
mouthfeel
is
a
proper
balance
for
the
style
drinkability
for
an
imperial
pumpkin
is
surprisingly
good
if
you
have
access
to
this
in
your
state
try
it
pours
a
mud
puddle
brown
color
with
some
amber
highlights
fairly
small
tight
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
primarily
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
nutmeg
and
allspice
come
to
mind
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
a
rather
subdued
aroma
the
flavor
has
some
noticable
pumpkin
flavor
to
it
with
the
nutmeg
and
allspice
spices
some
solvent
notes
come
through
from
the
abv
which
hinders
the
nice
pumpkin
and
spice
flavors
kind
of
a
shame
the
feel
is
moderate
with
fizzy
carbonation
which
gives
the
beer
a
nice
crisp
feel
the
abv
is
noticable
and
leaves
a
little
belly
burn
a
bit
sticky
in
the
end
i
wanted
to
like
this
pumpkin
ale
but
the
high
abv
prevented
that
from
happening
it
is
not
bad
has
some
nice
flavor
but
there
is
just
not
a
need
to
imperialize
this
style
worth
a
try
d
i
found
this
above
average
overall
i
would
be
pleased
to
try
this
again
it
was
a
fresh
tasting
bottle
and
spicing
doesnt
overwhelm
the
taste
the
only
thing
prohibiting
multiple
tastes
is
the
abv
a
good
imperial
but
there
are
a
few
that
rank
higher
imo
pours
a
slightly
thickened
light
to
medium
orange
with
a
nice
off
white
head
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
nose
is
caramel
brown
sugar
hints
of
cream
and
plenty
of
pumpkin
spices
taste
is
the
same
with
the
more
traditional
nonspice
flavors
taking
the
front
seat
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
a
bit
creamy
drinkability
gets
a
higher
score
as
this
really
goes
down
well
and
is
one
of
only
a
few
pumpkins
beers
that
i
can
actually
drink
twelve
ounces
of
d
goes
down
smoothly
but
the
alcohol
flavor
really
slows
you
down
which
is
good
because
its
9
river
horse
is
only
20
minutes
from
my
home
so
i
always
want
to
try
their
brews
whenever
i
can
and
as
a
fan
of
a
good
pumpkin
ale
i
had
to
give
this
fall
seasonal
from
their
brewers
reserve
a
shot
this
is
a
really
nice
looking
pumpkin
a
rich
darkorange
color
with
significant
beige
head
elaborate
lacing
coated
the
glass
but
without
much
head
retention
some
pumpkin
beers
seem
to
ignore
actual
pumpkin
flavor
all
together
but
luckily
river
horse
kept
it
in
the
brew
this
smells
beautiful
with
a
lot
of
allspice
cinnamon
pumpkin
itself
and
a
little
alcohol
the
taste
is
much
of
the
same
but
i
couldnt
actually
taste
the
9
00
abv
making
it
rather
dangerous
on
a
chilled
autumn
eve
not
much
carbonation
the
spicy
flavor
keeps
your
tongue
occupied
instead
the
flavor
wasnt
as
strong
as
it
could
have
been
which
would
be
great
for
some
folks
but
i
really
like
my
pumpkin
beers
to
be
fully
flavored
since
i
rarely
enjoy
more
than
one
a
night
despite
the
higher
abv
this
is
a
pumpkin
that
someone
could
have
a
few
of
without
being
overwhelmed
with
spiciness
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
but
nothing
particularly
wrong
with
it
either
drinkability
this
is
a
slow
drinking
beer
but
provides
a
sign
that
fall
and
football
are
starting
definitely
a
well
done
beer
but
alcohol
will
limit
you
to
one
per
session
the
carbonation
is
low
and
the
beer
coats
the
mouth
which
mitigates
the
thin
mouthfeel
a
bit
the
fact
that
its
9
abv
really
sneaks
up
on
you
though
the
abv
isnt
on
the
bottle
so
i
can
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
and
then
getting
surprised
when
my
head
gets
funny
but
this
a
very
good
beer
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
i
can
definitely
see
coming
back
to
this
one
a
few
times
throughout
the
fall
drinkability
highly
impressed
by
river
horses
offering
hippolantern
shows
what
pumpkin
beer
properties
should
be
all
about
not
overspiced
and
a
medium
malt
backbone
to
keep
it
balanced
the
highlight
of
this
beer
is
the
color
what
a
beautiful
beer
in
the
glass
the
abv
is
not
too
evident
but
the
added
alcohol
benefits
this
beer
as
its
not
too
thick
where
you
wouldnt
be
able
to
grab
another
one
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
river
horse
but
they
really
put
me
over
with
this
fall
offering
try
it
d
i
can
session
on
this
beer
way
too
easily
as
soon
as
the
temperature
drops
i
am
drinking
multiple
of
these
delicious
drinkable
fall
pumpkin
beer
this
one
really
surprised
me
color
me
impressed
highly
recommend
d
very
drinkable
especially
at
9
my
glass
was
empty
before
i
realized
it
that
being
said
overall
i
was
slightly
disappointed
by
this
beer
as
the
other
beers
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
were
very
tasty
the
pumpkin
doesnt
stand
out
much
except
with
a
slightly
off
aftertaste
dm
crisp
and
heavy
but
still
very
drinkable
but
definitely
leaves
an
aftertaste
very
creative
name
and
it
was
great
to
see
such
a
great
beer
from
nj
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
brown
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
it
smells
of
pumpkin
pie
with
whipped
cream
the
taste
is
awesome
pumpkiny
with
evened
out
spices
it
leaves
no
bite
on
the
tongue
only
a
lingering
taste
of
pumpkin
pie
and
hops
the
pumpkin
isnt
too
overpowering
it
goes
well
with
the
spices
not
too
thin
of
a
beer
either
i
didnt
notice
it
was
9
abv
until
i
saw
the
bottle
this
is
a
great
beer
md
this
beer
is
smooth
with
just
a
bit
of
heat
form
the
alcohol
it
is
my
first
pumpkin
of
the
season
and
i
think
does
a
pretty
good
job
overall
it
would
make
for
a
nice
sipper
this
fall
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
more
than
two
in
an
evening
thanx
to
smutty33
for
givin
me
one
of
these
to
try
and
i
am
impressed
im
drinking
it
now
and
it
holds
up
pretty
solid
to
the
other
pumpkins
out
there
and
hats
off
to
river
horse
for
making
an
imperial
pumpkin
this
exceeded
my
expectations
as
ive
had
hopolatamus
and
some
of
their
other
stuff
and
id
say
its
just
decent
im
not
gonna
do
the
whole
astmd
thing
cuz
i
really
dont
know
if
many
people
give
a
s
abot
that
to
be
honest
but
this
was
good
very
worthy
of
giving
it
a
shot
i
will
be
picking
this
up
on
a
near
trip
im
sure
i
will
say
its
a
solid
b
i
tried
a
couple
other
pumpkin
beers
with
friends
and
this
took
the
cake
its
just
not
a
novelty
beer
like
many
others
and
tries
to
go
back
to
the
roots
of
being
a
beer
d
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
and
my
first
of
the
season
i
am
sure
ill
have
this
one
again
in
the
coming
months
md
full
body
that
ends
sticky
flavor
lingers
and
as
it
fades
the
pumpkin
an
spices
really
shine
through
although
it
is
sweeter
than
any
i
have
tried
it
is
really
tasty
would
probably
be
able
to
have
a
few
if
it
was
cooler
impressed
d
as
a
result
of
the
thinish
mouthfeel
its
a
drinkable
beer
that
may
have
you
going
through
two
or
more
in
an
evening
if
youre
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
definitely
recommended
for
a
goaround
and
hats
off
to
river
horse
for
making
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
dessert
beer
i
would
likely
only
drink
one
at
a
sitting
though
overall
i
would
give
this
beer
a
very
good
rating
it
is
one
of
the
bigger
pumpkins
out
there
aside
from
say
st
pumpking
and
sure
will
take
the
chill
out
of
a
cool
fall
night
i
would
definately
recomend
it
for
anyone
who
likes
a
stronger
pumpkin
ale
overall
the
1st
pumpkin
of
the
season
and
i
think
it
sets
the
bar
pretty
high
1
of
my
friends
said
tastes
like
autumn
and
thats
a
good
thing
the
beer
is
a
bit
boozy
but
a
decent
beer
of
the
style
extremely
impressed
with
this
brew
wasnt
expecting
much
but
i
was
definitely
wrong
has
a
perfect
texture
and
blend
of
flavors
with
pumpkin
and
caramel
tasting
the
boldest
this
could
be
my
new
favorite
pumpkin
brew
and
for
a
22
at
5
49
ill
be
stocking
up
on
these
very
clear
dark
pumpkin
colored
like
a
dusky
fall
orange
white
head
is
thick
with
great
retention
and
lacing
clumps
are
sliding
down
the
glass
and
sticking
to
the
sides
active
carbonation
is
evident
as
the
glass
sits
and
with
each
swallow
smell
is
a
mix
of
biscuit
malt
and
pumpkin
meat
toasted
multigrain
bread
and
light
butterscotch
pumpkin
pie
spice
is
showing
along
with
a
sweet
alcohol
note
taste
is
sweet
and
alcoholic
with
a
firm
bitterness
in
the
finish
malted
caramel
sweetness
in
the
front
with
a
maris
otter
malt
biscuit
and
toast
flavor
pumpkin
pie
sits
on
top
of
the
caramel
and
tries
to
cover
the
alcohol
but
it
just
cant
a
as
the
flex
is
too
bold
firm
bitterness
rides
in
on
the
last
of
the
booze
and
leaves
an
herbal
and
slightly
minty
finish
slight
metallic
mineral
edge
along
with
other
flavors
give
this
an
overall
english
character
with
an
imperial
pumpkin
edge
feel
is
slightly
heavy
with
a
light
syrup
consistency
carbonation
is
smooth
and
very
well
done
making
this
sipper
of
an
ale
quite
easy
drinking
a
solid
imperial
pumpkin
that
while
a
not
a
quaffer
goes
down
easily
temperature
is
very
important
with
this
one
the
flavors
develop
and
unify
as
it
warms
to
english
pub
temp
much
better
flavor
cool
than
cold
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
an
interesting
tannic
offering
with
enough
pupokin
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
i
think
this
is
a
decent
take
on
the
style
but
a
little
too
tannic
and
bitter
to
make
me
want
to
have
it
again
o
enjoyable
but
the
alcohol
is
not
as
well
hidden
as
in
some
other
beers
in
the
style
also
the
cinnamon
is
a
little
too
intense
in
this
brew
for
my
tastes
things
seem
just
a
touch
out
of
balance
between
the
pumpkin
and
spices
overall
a
tasty
pumpkin
brew
it
has
a
nice
warming
feel
with
a
nice
flavor
profile
a
good
holiday
brew
to
sit
back
with
and
sip
during
the
fall
season
o
i
think
this
takes
the
cake
as
far
as
pumpkin
beers
go
this
year
if
this
were
in
a
sixpack
id
be
buying
it
over
schlaflys
even
to
be
honest
i
think
its
the
absence
of
spice
intensity
that
makes
this
one
the
best
i
mean
we
all
know
pumpkin
pie
has
those
spices
to
it
but
if
i
ever
tasted
a
pie
that
was
as
superspiced
as
some
of
these
beers
have
been
i
wouldnt
go
back
for
a
second
bite
once
again
balance
wins
o
i
cant
say
i
like
this
one
there
are
many
better
pumpkin
beers
to
choose
from
so
the
last
couple
of
inches
are
headed
down
the
drain
o
i
like
it
and
would
but
again
given
the
almost
3
more
to
get
my
hands
on
a
pumking
i
may
make
this
one
my
choice
pumpkin
brew
less
intense
sweetness
by
allocating
the
focus
toward
the
spices
good
job
heavy
seas
it
seems
that
stronger
malted
ales
are
the
prefered
base
type
for
better
support
of
spice
the
first
56
ounces
were
flavorful
and
bright
but
the
sweetness
starch
and
strong
cinnamon
balance
began
to
wear
on
me
going
into
the
second
half
of
the
glass
i
know
i
am
throwing
off
the
curve
on
this
but
i
really
have
to
this
is
simply
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
ever
had
and
i
love
pumpkin
ales
at
first
pour
it
is
as
orange
as
orange
gets
and
really
does
set
you
in
the
mood
for
the
season
the
aroma
coming
out
of
my
glass
a
full
two
or
three
feet
from
my
face
was
enough
that
i
could
smell
it
and
was
delighted
by
it
the
taste
is
purely
pumpkin
and
strong
which
is
a
nice
change
from
the
more
weaker
pumpkin
flavored
ales
on
the
market
ive
been
typing
for
a
few
minutes
now
and
i
can
still
taste
it
on
my
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
i
like
too
much
like
soda
but
still
pleasant
overall
this
is
absolutely
a
must
have
for
pumpkin
ales
and
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
well
done

up
in
the
finish
along
with
lingering
spices
vegetal
bitterness
and
leftover
malt
sweetness
mediumfull
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
feel
a
big
intensely
flavored
pumpkin
ale
that
comes
in
a
notch
below
pumking
and
weyerbacher
taking
the
alcohol
into
consideration
and
by
that
i
mean
placing
this
in
an
imperial
pumpkin
category
this
one
isnt
too
bad
the
alcohol
is
hot
and
very
noticeable
i
wouldnt
have
this
one
again
pumpking
is
still
the
king
of
imperial
pumpkins
o
as
the
pumpkin
style
has
gotten
so
popular
its
hard
to
differentiate
and
heavy
seas
lands
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
with
this
if
youre
looking
for
a
bigger
abv
pumkin
ale
and
cant
get
pumking
give
it
a
shot
an
inoffensive
imperial
pumpkin
its
not
too
spicy
its
not
too
sweet
its
not
too
vegetal
its
not
very
good
either
though
its
middling
o
not
a
bad
pumpkin
brew
id
drink
another
one
a
benchmark
for
what
a
pumpkin
beer
should
be
true
to
the
taste
of
the
vegetable
itself
malty
yet
with
some
mild
citrus
notes
indicative
of
american
hops
rich
and
savory
yet
drinkable
even
the
fact
that
its
slightly
warming
highly
recommended
for
the
season
maybe
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
out
there
but
getting
past
the
appearance
definitely
enjoyable
id
be
curious
to
try
one
fresh
i
was
disappointed
that
this
was
only
an
average
beer
i
had
high
hopes
but
its
too
one
dimensional
the
alcohol
was
just
too
aggressive
ive
had
beers
with
double
the
abv
that
were
more
balanced
original
review

bomber
bottle
poured
into
tulip
pours
dark
orange
with
medium
head
all
i
can
smell
here
is
nutmeg
there
is
no
sign
of
pumpkin
and
the
spice
is
offputting
and
unpleasant
flavor
follows
with
unbearable
nutmeg
that
takes
my
breath
away
no
real
pumpkin
flavor
and
nothing
that
says
to
me
that
this
is
a
beer
the
palate
is
thick
and
yet
burns
with
the
spices
here
this
was
a
drain
pour
and
a
half
o
right
on
the
edge
of
giving
it
a
4
5
overall
i
definitely
recommend
the
heavy
seas
great
pumpkin
there
is
no
bottlingfreshness
date
on
the
bottle
so
im
wondering
if
a
fresh
bottle
would
make
a
difference
its
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
but
i
do
like
it
very
much
maybe
this
would
make
a
good
introduction
for
craft
beer
drinkers
that
are
new
to
pumpkin
beer
you
know
rather
than
give
them
the
best
right
out
of
the
gate
start
them
off
with
something
a
little
more
crowd
friendly
but
at
the
same
time
id
hate
to
hand
them
something
less
flavorful
and
give
them
a
poor
representation
alltogether
bottle
pours
a
orangy
color
with
a
slight
white
head
like
chunks
if
so
this
is
the
beer
for
you
murky
with
little
flecks
of
chunk
floating
around
allspice
caramel
and
pumpkin
in
the
nose
actually
not
a
bad
aroma
medium
mouthfeel
slightly
sweet
upfront
pumpkin
pie
slight
cinnamon
allspice
and
whip
cream
just
kidding
overall
not
bad
i
am
not
the
biggest
pumpkin
fan
but
this
is
tolerable
for
me
it
does
have
a
slight
pepper
note
to
it
thought
that
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
o
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
this
season
its
balanced
even
with
the
high
abv
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
is
a
really
nice
tasting
beer
and
it
has
a
nice
smoothness
to
it
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
pumpkin
flavor
that
stood
out
but
it
is
still
really
nice
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
higher
alcohol
pumpkin
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
i
definitely
think
it
is
worth
checking
out
sadly
i
wanted
to
like
the
great
pumpkin
more
than
i
actually
did
my
girlfriend
liked
this
one
more
than
i
though
so
your
mileage
may
vary
o
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
greater
pumpkin
and
though
this
doesnt
equal
it
the
great
pumpkin
comes
closer
its
a
lighter
more
accessible
version
even
if
its
still
on
the
strong
end
of
the
pumpkin
beer
spectrum
highly
recommended
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
out
there
will
drink
again
paired
with
thanksgiving
pumpkin
pie
a
recommended
pairing
o
overall
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
have
yet
to
find
something
that
rivals
pumking
it
is
a
nice
attempt
at
a
more
squashbased
pumpkin
ale
instead
of
your
typical
spiced
brown
ale
but
it
does
not
impress
me
the
flatness
and
metallic
taste
in
the
finish
ruin
it
for
me
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
true
pint
the
beer
is
a
light
bright
coppertinted
orange
coloring
with
a
thick
foamy
light
small
bubbled
frothy
white
head
that
stands
a
good
solid
inch
and
a
half
aromas
of
smoke
and
roasted
pumpkin
on
the
nose
with
a
very
light
spicing
and
some
wheat
characteristics
flavors
are
round
and
smooth
with
a
slightly
sour
tang
on
the
tail
end
the
bulk
of
the
flavor
profile
is
a
light
smooth
pumpkin
and
spice
balance
which
is
mostly
cinnamon
and
the
overall
flavor
comes
off
like
a
batch
of
pumpkin
cookies
the
aftertaste
is
sugary
sweet
but
shortlived
the
abruptness
of
the
aftertaste
keeps
it
from
being
overpowering
or
cloying
a
candied
finish
both
quick
and
sweet
tasty
beer
and
with
all
the
sweet
profile
it
would
make
a
tasty
dessert
beer
o
i
dont
know
if
ill
come
back
to
this
one
eventually
i
enjoy
giving
almost
anything
pumpkin
flavored
a
whirl
but
it
is
certainly
worth
a
look
if
you
enjoy
the
style
o
ill
admit
that
im
generally
turned
off
by
floaties
i
know
its
fine
for
them
to
be
there
ive
just
never
cared
for
them
in
my
beer
at
least
aesthetically
overall
this
is
nice
nothing
spectacular
but
certainly
worth
a
try
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
lunch
for
sending
me
this
one
in
a
past
trade
2010
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
poured
orange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
pumpkin
brown
sugar
and
spices
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
pumpkin
alcohol
brown
sugar
and
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
this
was
not
overly
complex
which
left
me
wishing
and
hoping
for
more
this
was
okay
though
as
the
flavors
that
were
there
were
just
right
in
intensity
i
had
this
one
right
before
the
bal
aged
version
so
i
was
hopeful
that
this
would
help
the
base
brew
while
i
was
having
it
it
did
just
for
the
record
o
a
pretty
decent
pumpkin
ale
id
like
a
bit
less
alcohol
presence
a
creamier
body
and
more
pumpkin
flavors
but
still
its
not
bad
at
all
o
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
better
than
the
vast
majority
the
sweetnessspicinessbitterness
are
all
well
balanced
and
its
a
pleasant
fall
beer
worth
a
look
for
sure
solid
pumpkin
ale
with
a
more
sweet
vegetable
flavor
than
most
o
i
think
the
intensity
of
this
beer
gives
it
an
acquired
taste
its
a
big
beer
that
makes
for
good
sipping
take
it
slow
with
this
one
be
warned
the
alcohol
content
might
grab
you
if
you
are
not
careful
enjoy
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
and
soft
texture
a
little
watery
diminishes
the
finish
but
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
ale
a
little
unique
with
a
more
hoppy
finish
than
you
would
really
expect
in
a
pumpkin
beer
osplit
a
bomber
dont
drink
the
whole
thing
like
i
did
you
have
to
try
it
cuz
it
has
a
cool
label
at
least
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
but
not
spectacular
either
the
bitterness
that
im
getting
seems
out
of
place
and
i
dont
remember
it
from
the
last
time
i
had
this
beer
so
maybe
this
is
an
off
bottle
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
good
spice
level
good
drinkability
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
pumpkin
ale
i
like
my
pumpkin
ales
to
have
a
noticeable
pumpkin
flavor
and
not
dominated
by
spices
and
in
this
beer
the
spices
were
just
too
dominating
and
didnt
let
much
pumpkin
or
malt
flavor
shine
through
the
heavy
spices
and
slightly
warming
alcohol
dont
make
this
beer
too
drinkable
i
am
glad
i
am
splitting
this
bomber
with
my
brother
or
else
this
might
be
a
chore
to
finish
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
seems
to
have
ok
balance
in
the
aroma
and
it
was
similar
to
pumpkin
pie
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
there
was
just
too
much
spices
and
too
little
malts
and
pumpkin
i
dont
think
i
would
get
this
beer
again
when
in
need
for
a
pumpkin
ale
screaming
pumpkin
is
cheaper
more
balanced
and
tastes
better
if
you
love
pumpkin
ales
you
may
want
to
give
it
a
try
but
expect
it
to
be
spice
forward
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
it
just
lacked
the
balance
that
i
look
for
the
most
in
this
style
screaming
pumpkin
from
the
michigan
brewing
company
is
still
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
but
i
would
still
take
this
over
samuel
adams
harvest
pumpkin
ale
and
i
would
like
to
try
the
greater
pumpkin
if
i
see
it
around
maybe
barrel
aging
is
just
what
this
beer
needs
my
least
favorite
beer
from
the
mutiny
fleet
so
far
but
peg
leg
is
still
my
least
favorite
beer
from
them
a
spicy
but
delicious
pumpkin
beer
wish
there
was
just
as
much
pumpkin
on
the
tongue
as
there
was
on
the
nose
but
that
may
come
out
with
more
time
this
one
is
a
bit
fresh
cheap
for
a
bomber
and
good
something
id
recommend
for
someone
looking
for
more
in
this
style
of
beer
malty
aroma
has
a
firm
overtone
of
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
very
october
indeed
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
coppery
amber
with
a
thin
pale
pumpkinorange
head
but
the
condition
of
the
head
may
be
an
artifact
of
the
pour
lipsmacking
malty
flavor
has
firm
tones
of
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
with
hints
of
cloves
and
fruit
and
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
nip
texture
has
above
average
body
and
is
smooth
with
a
subtle
fizz
leaving
an
edgy
malty
pumpkin
finish
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
o
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
some
noticeable
alcohol
but
not
too
much
not
sure
i
would
get
this
or
most
pumpkin
beers
again
but
i
enjoyed
it
o
solid
pumpkin
ale
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
season
solid
orangebrownishgoldeny
color
with
an
off
white
head
smells
like
freshly
baked
pumpkin
pie
huge
whiff
of
molasses
and
brown
sugar
malty
pumpkiny
goodness
here
heavily
spiced
with
a
slight
hop
backbone
sticky
and
medium
bodied
pumpkin
flavor
is
very
prevalent
great
example
of
a
well
crafted
impy
pumpkin
ale
tasty
yet
not
overly
cloying
will
look
for
this
again
every
year
this
is
a
pretty
looking
beer
nice
hazy
burnt
orange
with
a
sticky
slimy
frothy
head
looks
like
a
dipa
sexy
smells
of
light
pumpkin
taste
with
a
sweet
apricot
smell
coming
through
the
taste
has
a
smokey
nutmeg
taste
alcohol
very
present
again
light
pumpkin
nice
spice
balance
clove
medium
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
overall
this
beer
is
okay
i
just
find
it
hard
with
pumking
out
there
to
ever
justify
buying
this
again
trying
out
of
my
first
imperial
pumpkins
from
a
local
brewery
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
even
my
girlfriend
thought
so
and
smells
or
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
taste
is
definitely
very
strong
on
the
spices
maybe
a
bit
too
much
never
thought
id
say
this
but
it
could
use
more
pumpkin
flavoring
the
spices
kind
of
ruin
the
palette
after
a
while
pretty
good
beer
and
totally
hides
the
alcohol
but
not
for
everyone
this
has
almost
an
abbey
ale
pumpkin
feel
to
it
there
a
cottoncandy
sweetness
to
it
theres
a
cloudy
almost
porter
underpinning
to
this
brew
there
is
clearly
a
nice
brown
sugarpumpkin
feel
to
it
but
the
sweetness
of
it
almost
feels
like
im
going
to
get
diabetes
good
beer
but
can
only
have
one
and
done
pours
a
slightly
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
fizzy
1
inch
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
random
dots
and
streaks
of
lace
drip
back
down
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
pumpkin
puree
and
pumpkin
pie
spices
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
slight
pumpkin
flavors
and
a
variety
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
but
cinnamon
seems
to
be
in
the
forefront
a
bitter
spice
aftertaste
lingers
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
and
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
tried
this
fall
season
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
o
its
kind
of
like
they
wanted
to
make
a
strong
pumpkin
beer
but
went
too
far
with
all
of
the
special
ingredients
my
inability
to
derive
at
least
a
malt
profile
from
this
beer
leaves
me
somewhat
disappointed
plus
there
really
arent
that
many
pumpkin
notes
detected
other
than
in
the
nose
another
in
a
series
of
letdowns
from
heavy
seas
im
beginning
to
wonder
if
loose
cannon
and
dubbel
cannon
are
their
only
good
beers
o
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
of
this
beer
which
helps
its
drinkability
its
not
one
of
the
greatest
pumpkin
beers
out
there
but
is
a
good
offering
overall
a
solid
imperial
pumpkin
beer
would
choose
this
over
pumking
hands
down
overall
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
if
they
just
would
tone
down
the
cinnamon
a
hair
it
would
really
knock
this
up
a
notch
just
a
little
heavy
on
the
spice
i
really
like
this
offering
from
heavy
seas
i
purchased
a
few
bottles
of
this
and
their
greater
pumpkin
not
really
knowing
what
to
expect
this
was
a
nice
orangeish
color
when
poured
into
a
glass
and
had
a
very
nice
smell
the
ale
went
down
very
smooth
with
spice
and
pumpkin
taste
being
relevant
im
anxious
now
to
try
the
greater
version
of
this
as
i
would
imagine
it
only
gets
better
overall
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
pumpkin
beer
balance
and
most
importantly
does
not
use
pumpkin
spices
to
fool
you
into
thinking
there
is
pumpkin
flavor
i
admit
i
didnt
finish
all
11oz
of
my
share
because
it
does
tend
to
sit
a
little
bit
heavier
on
the
stomachpalate
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
i
wanted
a
hearty
spiced
pumpkin
ale
for
fall
im
hoisting
my
glass
and
giving
an
affirmative
arrrr
to
heavy
seas
medium
in
texture
with
light
carbonation
the
feel
is
pretty
enjoyable
and
unlike
some
it
isnt
too
big
for
the
flavor
or
for
any
extended
drinking
experience
one
of
clipper
citys
finer
offerings
in
my
opinion
for
an
imperial
pumpkin
this
is
pretty
good
i
still
rather
have
a
nonimperial
version
any
day
though
omy
first
experience
with
heavy
seas
or
clipper
city
and
it
was
really
good
one
of
the
beer
beers
at
the
tasting
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
booziness
kills
it
for
me
still
very
much
looking
forward
to
trying
the
greater
pumpkin
however
heavy
seas
is
doing
there
job
on
this
one
cant
wait
to
crack
that
bottle
of
greater
pumpkin

both
head
retention
and

are
decent
aroma
is
spicy
it
smells
like

and
some
pumpkin
the
taste
is
mostly
like
the
aroma
the
pumpkin

spice
flavors
are
dominant
but
there
is
some
pumpkin
and
a
bit
of
booze
noticeable
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a

slick
and
has

i
think
its
a
decent
enough
pumpkin
beer
but
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
with
that
being
said
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
at
just

worth
trying

that
quickly
dissolved

the

malty

slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
maybe
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
1st
sip
brings
a
taste
of
pumpkin
malt
and
spices
there
is
a
strong
bitterness
on
the
finish
from
a
combination
of
hops
alcohol
spice
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
medium
body
i
notice
some
pumpkin
ales
choose
to
have
the
pumpkin
taste
as
the
main
flavor
while
others
have
it
as
the
spice
i
prefer
the
spice
and
this
one
is
somewhere
in
the
middle
a
decent
one
but
not
in
the
top
5
its
better
than
most
of
the
pumpkin
fare
out
there
definitely
more
pumpkin
forward
than
most
of
the
others
doesnt
compare
to
weyerbacher
or
southern
tier
though
overall
i
would
judge
this
beer
as
medium
bodied
and
a
good
representative
of
this
beer
category
but
i
am
just
not
a
lover
of
this
style
so
maybe
not
the
best
judge
pours
a
nice
amberorange
color
w
a
nice
one
finger
cocoa
head
average
carbonation
and
lacing
for
this
brew
nice
orange
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
nose
is
mainly
cinnamon
w
some
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
not
as
complex
as
weyerbacher
and
this
beer
is
definitely
in
the
same
vein
taste
is
fortunately
better
than
the
nose
big
malt
background
on
this
beer
and
that
saves
it
for
me
not
over
the
top
just
about
right
feel
isnt
complex
enough
for
me
and
a
little
thin
overall
this
beer
wants
to
be
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
but
isnt
quite
there
still
a
decent
brew
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
cheers
o
gotta
say
im
disappointed
considering
the
style
at
times
it
feels
heavyhanded
but
moreso
it
just
feels
unartfully
made
ive
had
much
worse
but
in
this
day
of
a
million
pumpkin
beers
this
is
worth
a
onetime
try
and
nothing
more
o
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
but
needs
a
bit
more
hops
or
spice
or
something
to
give
it
a
little
oomph
not
a
pumpkin
id
like
to
try
again
standard
red
copper
in
the
glass
with
a
thin
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
quite
clear
the
smell
is
dominated
by
spice
with
the
typical
cinnamon
all
spice
and
nutmeg
with
a
bit
of
hop
and
a
touch
of
malt
in
there
as
well
overall
the
smell
is
nice
it
is
clear
that
this
is
a
pumpkin
ale
to
me
the
spicing
seems
a
bit
overdone
in
the
taste
maybe
its
just
due
to
the
fact
that
this
is
my
first
pumpkin
beer
of
the
season
and
im
not
used
to
these
flavors
yet
but
this
one
seems
a
bit
over
the
top
especially
on
the
first
sip
so
the
spicing
dominates
yet
beyond
that
is
a
good
balance
of
crystal
malt
and
enough
bitterness
to
almost
rein
in
the
spice
as
it
warms
the
spice
fades
a
bit
i
do
have
to
give
credit
where
its
due
in
that
this
beer
doesnt
come
off
as
overly
sweet
and
may
appeal
to
those
who
like
an
assertively
spiced
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
to
me
again
a
bit
too
much
spice
makes
it
feel
overly
busy
and
the
finish
is
like
a
spoonful
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
overall
its
good
and
will
definitely
find
favor
with
people
who
like
a
strong
example
of
the
style
but
falls
short
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
ogreat
pumpkin
beer
that
isnt
just
packed
full
of
sweet
pumpkin
but
instead
has
great
body
and
flavor
o
very
enjoyable
pumpkin
beer
i
have
not
had
a
lot
of
pumpkin
beers
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
might
grab
a
couple
bottles
for
october
this
is
a
borderline
excellent
beer
with
some
tweaking
of
the
spice
ratios
and
perhaps
some
modification
of
the
pumpkin
to
better
create
the
illusion
that
cooked
pumpkin
does
not
taste
just
like
squash
this
would
be
fantastic
i
will
probably
try
it
again

2011

aroma
carries
a
medium
to
heavy
nose
blend
of
cinnamon
brown
sugar
nutmeg
and
possibly
pumpkin
the
general
mouthfeel
here
is
a
big
spicy
one
with
an
emphasis
on
the
cinnamon
burnt
sugar
and
pumpkin
spice
at
first
sips
the
taste
walks
the
line
of
being
just
a
bit
too

the
finish
is
fairly
dry
but
there
is
some
lingering
notes
of
sweetness
with
some
spices
no
bitterness
noticed
but
it
fits
this
style
perfectly
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
only
a
very
small
warming
after
the
finish
noticed
quite
drinkable
because
of
the
good
flavor
and
very
smooth
going
down
medium
carbonation
and
body
i
was
actually
letting
this
sit
in
the
fridge
for
a
while
afraid
to
try
it
because
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
most
pumpkin
beers
can
be
done
very
badly
but
this
one
is
done
very
well
and
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
delicious
the
allspice
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
dominate
this
and
the
pumpkin
is
lost
its
a
nice
dark
copper
color
with
descent
head
and
lacing
the
smell
is
amazing
and
the
taste
is
very
good
however
the
spices
overpower
the
malts
and
the
pumpkin
slightly
overcarbonated
a
bit
creamy
hard
to
drink
past
the
spice
a
bit
cloying
and
sweet
but
not
syrupy
good
beer
but
dogfish
head
has
a
better
balanced
version
poured
into
snifter
on
1003
this
beer
accompanied
a
thanksgiving
style
dinner
and
was
well
recieved
this
pumpkin
ale
pours
orange
topped
with
a
thin
white
head
it
smelles
of
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
etc
mixed
with
some
dark
fruit
notes
the
taste
follows
suit
but
adds
some
caramel
and
vanilla
to
the
party
medium
body
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
work
nice
together
for
this
one
i
found
it
very
tasty
for
this
time
of
year
fall
and
would
purchase
another
bottle
or
2
next
year
poured
a
medium
amberorange
with
a
large
white
creamy
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
and
had
good
lacing
the
aroma
hits
you
right
of
the
bat
with
the
scent
of
cinnamon
nutmeg
brown
sugar
and
pumpkin
with
notes
of
a
cookie
malt
and
a
sweet
doughy
yeast
it
tastes
mildly
sweet
with
strong
notes
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
right
off
then
became
more
of
an
almost
pumpkin
pie
flavor
with
a
mild
alcohol
tinge
near
the
end
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
and
creamy
in
texture
with
a
lively
carbonation
overall
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
tasted
to
date
d
definitely
a
solid
tasty
pumpkin
ale
that
drank
really
good
and
is
probably
in
the
top
five
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
brews
d
i
think
i
preferred
the
bourbon
barrel
one
but
this
wasnt
bad
either
poured
from
bomber
into
dimpled
glass
amber
pour
with
a
small

that
doesnt
last
too
long

with
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
a
touch
of
clovesall
the
requisite
pumpkin
pie
spices
sweet
malt
beneath
it
all
smooth
taste
with
the
pumpkin
subtle
in
the
background
sweet
spicy
malt
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
not
sure
if
thats
the
hops
or
a
bit
of
boozy
heat
solid
and
not
too
heavy
on
the
pumpkin
my
top
pumpkin
beer
to
date
id
like
to
try
the
greater
pumpkin
someday
however
d
strong
spices
and
pretty
apparent
alcohol
really
hurt
the
drinkability
d
easy
to
drink
easy
to
enjoy
the
great
pumpkin
is
definitely
good
pumpkin
beer
but
with
all
do
respect
its
name
might
be
just
a
little
selfaggrandizing
to
be
sure
there
are
both
better
and
worse
examples
on
the
market
but
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
heavy
seas
offering
should
be
considered
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
easily
drinkable
specimens
of
this
often
polarizing
style
not
much
of
a
head
on
this
one
maybe
half
a
finger
little
lace
and
very
little
cling
cloudy
orange
coloring
close
to
an
11
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smells
of
nutmeg
vanilla
cinnamon
and
of
course
pumpkin
flavors
i
detect
are
pumpkin
fugi
apple
nutmeg
vanilla
cinnamon
orange
peel
and
malt
good
feeling
in
my
mouth
very
full
and
creamy
usually
i
would
drink
this
in
octobernovember
but
would
also
try
it
as
a
desert
beer
little
heavy
beer
for
my
tastes
had
via
22oz
bottle
less
pumpkin
dominate
taste
than
other
pumpkin
beers
more
spicy
than
pumpkiny
worth
a
try
around
halloween
if
you
enjoy
spicedpumpkin
type
beers
cetainly
not
bad
for
a
try
give
it
a
shot
in
a
22oz
bottle
or
draft
before
going
for
a
sixpack
or
case
d
man
did
i
like
this
more
than
the
ba
version
but
overall
it
just
seems
to
big
for
a
pumpkin
ale
i
know
the
bottle
i
had
was
a
little
old
but
it
seems
kind
of
low
on
the
spice
department
but
delivers
the
right
amount
of
hops
punch
to
complete
the
brew
i
dont
know
if
i
will
buy
it
again
but
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
with
mild
spices
and
no
too
hoppy
one
step
below
pumking
d
the
great
pumpkin
may
be
the
best
pumpkin
beer
out
there
i
am
sorry
but
i
will
seek
this
brew
every
single
fall
season
from
here
on
out
great
job
heavy
seas
this
can
be
slammed
d
good
imperial
pumpkin
ale
with
the
typical
spices
and
pumpkin
flavor
alcohol
is
not
apparent
at
any
point
i
prefer
the
barrel
aged
version
but
this
is
still
a
good
example
of
the
style
pours
pumpkin
orange
and
boy
is
it
a
doozy
taste
of
pumpkin
pie
ever
increasing
each
sip
you
drink
has
a
thin
white
cool
whip
colored
head
smells
alot
like
pumpkin
pie
sipped
this
while
watching
its
the
great
pumpkin
charlie
brown
its
spices
actually
got
more
intense
as
i
continued
to
drink
it
i
think
i
might
make
this
a
new
halloween
tradition
d
tasty
and
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
good
scent
and
flavor
and
the
subtlest
warming
make
for
a
sipper
thats
gone
all
too
quickly
before
the
cold
and
wet
winter
really
sets
in
its
good
to
enjoy
this
liquid
depiction
of
fall
glad
to
have
one
more
and
would
seek
this
out
again
if
it
was
was
available
on
the
west
coast
poured
into
a
tulip
appearance
is
fairlydark
orange
with
a
white
head
and
some
pretty
good
lacing
nose
is
pretty
strong
amounts
of
pumpkin
as
well
as
a
bunch
of
spicing
light
sugar
presence
taste
is
a
bit
overspiced
feel
has
a
bit
of
extra
spicing
but
fits
pretty
well
balancing
the
sweetness
drinks
fairly
well
and
is
one
of
the
nicer
imperial
pumpkins
out
there
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
orangey
amber
with
a
milky
white
2
finger
head
that
clung
a
bit
to
the
sides
small
streams
of
carbonation
rose
from
the
bottom
aroma
was
a
creamy
pumpkin
pie
very
lightly
spiced
reminded
me
of
a
pumpkin
eggnog
flavor
was
more
spices
than
pumpkin
but
had
some
creaminess
to
it
occasionally
picked
up
a
slight
taste
of
bitterness
but
not
pronounced
felt
like
a
barleywine
or
old
ale
in
the
mouth
slightly
sticky
coated
well
very
pleasant
to
drink
not
necessarily
as
a
pumpkin
ale
but
as
a
solid
beer
autumn
has
a
mystique
all
seasons
do
i
know
but
autumn
is
the
most
beloved
because
it
is
the
most
fleeting
if
you
grew
up
in
the
us
in
the
last
few
decades
there
are
certain
tastes
and
smells
that
probably
make
you
think
of
autumn
and
unless
youre
some
kind
of
weirdo
whose
mom
didnt
allow
you
to
eat
sugar
or
if
your
dad
was
killed
by
a
scarecrow
these
flavors
will
make
you
happy
that
is
this
beer
will
make
you
happy
d
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
not
great
id
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
to
support
the
local
brewery
comparing
it
to
the
bourbon
barrel
version
i
like
the
barrel
version
better
its
a
little
more
complex
but
not
your
standard
pumpkin
beer
slightly
hazy
orangebrown
color
topped
with
a
thin
beige
foam
thin
stringy
lace
nice
smell
of
hops
with
cinammon
and
spices
full
of
flavor
with
out
any
component
overpowering
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
bitter
hops
and
pumkin
pie
spices
nutmeg
smooth
and
creamy
body
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
added
to
the
beer
alcohol
was
there
but
overly
hot
very
tasty
treat
pours
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
slight
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
fast
smells
like
a
pumpkin
candle
great
spice
smell
some
cinnamon
and
the
sweetness
comes
off
in
the
smell
taste
is
sweet
with
great
pumpkin
flavor
with
a
heavy
dose
of
spices
the
spices
linger
on
your
tongue
for
a
long
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
a
nice
heavy
dose
of
flavor
good
balance
this
pumpkin
ale
is
very
enjoyable
the
spices
dont
overwhelm
a
good
beer
for
the
season
worth
checking
out
for
fans
of
the
style
the
taste
is
centered
around
the
maltiness
with
notes
of
honey
and
vanilla
up
front
with
heavy
cinnamon
and
pie
spice
right
behind
it
under
that
there
is
just
a
hint
of
pumpkin
or
squash
like
flavor
this
finishes
with
a
bland
stale
pumpkin
flavor
which
seems
artificial
this
beer
starts
pleasant
and
end
blah
next
please
very
good
pumpkin
beer
i
will
admit
i
am
much
more
partial
to
the
greater
pumpkin
but
the
great
holds
its
own
easy
to
drink
and
the
abv
is
very
subtle
for
a
beer
at
8
the
smooth
flavor
is
ridiculous
i
have
had
better
pumpkin
beers
but
this
is
worthy
of
a
repeat
purchase
d
while
not
being
particularly
remarkable
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
though
im
not
sure
if
i
would
have
another
based
on
the
taste
d
excellent
october
beverage
dhad
the
whole
22oz
bomber
i
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
good
pumpkin
ale
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
d
definitely
a
step
up
in
terms
of
intensity
compared
to
your
run
of
the
mill
pumpkin
ale
an
interesting
offering
with
some
components
i
really
like
and
some
i
dont
worthy
of
exploring
due
to
its
uniqueness
but
not
something
i
would
necessarily
seek
out
again
make
this
one
walk
the
plank
drinkability
doesnt
match
up
to
dfh
punkin
or
weyerbacher
imperial
in
my
opinion
pours
a
nice
bright
orange
great
aroma
of
nutmeg
pumpkin
and
spices
taste
is
really
nice
again
nutmeg
spices
a
nice
pumpkin
but
nothing
too
sweet
a
great
addition
to
the
pumpkin
ale
selection
this
one
can
stand
tall
with
pumpking
and
smuttynose
a
solid
ale
that
doesnt
overwhelm
with
alchohol
even
though
its
an
imperial
nicely
balanced
to
bring
out
a
great
fall
flavor
i
look
forward
to
greater
pumpkin
which
is
this
beer
aged
in
bourbon
oak
barrels
which
i
also
bought
d
could
drink
this
all
night
excellent
overall
a
nice
beer
i
would
have
a
tough
time
choosing
this
over
weyebacher
which
says
a
lot
then
again
considering
the
availability
of
st
pumking
in
oh
what
am
i
considering
either
for
serving
type
bottle
to
a
chilled
pilsner
glass
still
have
learn
about
the
correct
glasses
to
drink
out
of
tasteis
bit
better
than
the
aroma
pumpkin
dominates
with
nutmeg
vanilla
cinnamon
and
spice
also
being
noticed
there
is
an
underlying
bitterness
that
tries
to
keep
it
as
balanced
as
it
can
which
is
nice
medium
bodied
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
is
solid
but
the
pumpkin
and
spice
levels
take
away
from
the
drinkability
for
me
although
just
about
any
pumpkin
ale
isnt
all
that
drinkable
to
me
pours
a
hazed
coppery
orange
color
with
nuce
head
retention
and
lacing
scent
is
dominated
by
a
strong
spice
profile
the
typical
cinammon
clove
nutmeg
but
also
has
a
decent
backbone
of
pumpkin
puree
and
grahmn
crackery
malt
taste
is
again
heavy
on
the
spice
maybe
a
touch
too
much
for
my
taste
but
the
backbone
of
pumpkin
puree
grahmn
cracker
and
sweet
cream
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
makes
it
one
of
the
top
beers
in
its
style
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
slightly
dry
well
i
haveta
do
the
comparison
to
pumpking
not
as
sweet
with
a
higher
spice
profile
again
a
top
notch
pumpkin
brew
the
doctor
is
in
and
ready
to
celebrate
the
season
this
is
a
great
pumpkin
beer
and
didnt
even
need
to
wait
in
a
patch
all
night
just
to
experience
it
happy
halloween
charlie
brown
this
is
truly
it
the
night
the
great
pumpkin
appeared
and
of
it
wasnt
so
sweet
and
just
a
touch
boozy
id
be
waiting
for
this
beer
every
year
as
far
as
the
side
by
to
be
honest
i
couldnt
pick
up
on
any
major
differences
i
think
the
greater
pumpkin
is
a
correct
description
as
i
preferred
it
over
the
other
but
again
no
striking
major
differences
taste
follows
suit
with
a
nicely
balanced
spicy
pumpkin
ale
not
overhopped
my
complaint
with
dfh
punk
tastes
like
a
nice
pumpkin
bread
moderate
mf
creamy
good
drinkability
had
this
next
to
pumking
and
pumking
was
the
winnermore
interesting
brew
but
this
one
made
a
strong
showing
a
nice
example
of
a
spicy
pumpkin
ale
and
affordable
at
622
oz
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
balanced
malt
and
fruit
scent
it
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
a
solid
pumpkin
aroma
and
a
wonderful
spice
bouquet
the
taste
is
outstanding
its
bold
and
flavorful
with
excellent
pumpkin
flavor
the
malt
bill
is
tasty
and
balanced
the
pumpkin
spices
are
present
but
not
overly
so
it
goes
down
smooth
with
little
alcohol
warmth
the
mouthfeel
is
great
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
fall
seasonal
its
better
than
most
pumpkin
beers
out
there
and
it
packs
twice
the
punch
d
thisd
be
a
great
draught
to
sit
back
and
watch
a
game
with
not
as
sessionable
as
some
other
pumpkin
offerings
but
thats
a
consequence
of
the
alcohol
more
than
anything
else
a
tasty
beer
nice
to
have
more
new
offerings
in
the
pumpkin
category
definitely
worth
checking
out
im
enjoying
this
one
and
it
isnt
as
filling
as
a
few
others
out
there
notes
for
me
it
was
a
little
heavy
on
the
spice
but
still
good
overall
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
and
rounded
malt
is
crisp
and
naturally
sweetened
by
pumpkin
a
moderate
fruit
flavor
that
allows
each
to
be
present
but
neither
overpowering
no
stickiness
or
artificial
hints
the
spices
are
not
overpowering
as
with
most
pumpkin
beers
cinnamon
and
cloves
are
the
most
prominent
while
ginger
and
nutmeg
support
there
is
a
touch
of
tartness
towards
the
end
all
around
a
very
clean
beer
that
drinks
lighter
than
it
is
carbonation
has
a
yeasty
feel
to
it
mediumstrong
and
functional
with
the
spice
notes
taste
spices
seem
a
little
out
of
balance
i
dont
really
get
the
sense
that
im
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
like
i
get
from
other
spiced
pumpkin
beers
medium
bodied
mediumcarbonation
mouthfeel
for
me
a
drinkability
level
on
par
with
its
flavor
which
is
to
say
average
drinkability
is
ok
the
flavor
rivals
other
top
pumkin
ales
i
felt
compelled
to
review
this
because
it
was
a
good
surprise
i
was
disappointed
with
the
pumpkin
ales
this
year
with
the
exception
of
dfh
for
the
most
part
southern
tier
pumking
was
a
huge
letdown
this
beat
out
southern
tier
its
actually
pretty
good
glad
i
tried
this
as
i
will
pick
up
again
its
probably
not
an
a
beer
for
its
very
worthy
and
its
only
5
99
which
makes
it
very
nice
nice
flavor
in
this
i
thought
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
very
nice
surprise
editing
my
score
cause
im
changing
it
from
bottle
to
on
tap
d
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
ale
i
enjoyed
the
smell
a
lot
i
wish
the
taste
had
been
a
little
sweeter
and
a
little
more
pumpkin
than
spice
but
still
a
good
beer
would
try
again
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
yellow
hints
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
pumpkin
spice
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
brown
sugar
cinnamon
pumpkin
and
ends
with
some
alcohol
a
spice
like
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
spice
in
the
aftertaste
nice
spice
and
a
bit
hot
from
alcohol
d
lets
see
how
will
i
remember
this
one
in
a
line
up
of
other
notable
pumpkin
brews
the
weyerbacher
had
the
over
the
top
cinnamon
taste
which
i
didnt
like
pumking
had
the
orgasmic
graham
cracker
nose
that
is
to
die
for
schlafly
had
the
deep
caramel
richness
i
thought
to
myself
what
does
this
one
have
therein
lies
the
problem
while
i
truly
believe
that
this
pumpkin
ale
is
nearly
flawless
in
its
style
class
i
cant
think
of
any
sort
of
wow
factor
characteristic
that
sets
it
apart
from
others
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
so
smooth
great
spices
too
but
not
overpowering
a
great
balance
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
all
year
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
good
pumpkin
ale
i
feel
that
it
would
be
better
if
it
had
some
breadyness
or
had
a
stout
or
brown
ale
flavor
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
this
is
worth
trying
drinkability
quite
good
but
overall
i
think
id
like
to
get
another
bottle
and
put
it
away
for
about
a
year
kind
of
like
pumking
still
a
great
beer
but
i
think
if
i
had
to
pick
the
best
overall
pumpkin
ale
to
have
fresh
id
have
to
go
with
frogs
hollow
drinkablity
i
wouldnt
call
this
sessionable
but
it
is
certainly
going
down
smooth
i
wont
have
any
problem
finishing
this
bomber
highly
recommended
d
smooth
and
tasty
alcohol
isnt
in
the
flavor
which
makes
this
quite
easy
to
drink
d
wow
great
job
by
heavy
seas
on
this
one
imo
glad
im
only
halfway
through
this
one
as
i
have
another
half
to
get
through
d
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
had
no
trouble
finishing
a
22oz
i
might
be
in
trouble
if
i
drank
2
but
thats
a
different
issue
d
one
is
enough
for
me
decent
flavor
unique
taste
pumpkin
beers
are
hit
or
miss
for
me
and
this
one
is
a
miss
pours
a
dark
golden
with
a
fairly
light
head
but
good
clarity
smells
sweet
with
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
a
sweet
pumpkin
tanginess
tastes
sweet
and
strong
with
some
more
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
a
bit
beefy
with
a
late
alcoholic
sting
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
sharp
on
the
alcohol
front
and
overall
this
beer
just
seems
a
little
too
much
without
delivering
the
concurrent
pleasure
needed
to
justify
all
the
alcohol
really
tasty
and
pretty
drinkable
even
with
the
strength
i
would
like
to
get
a
bottle
for
the
cellar
just
to
see
how
it
is
once
it
calms
down
after
a
full
bomber
the
8
abv
will
leave
you
a
bit
woozy
split
with
a
friend
if
you
need
to
drive
m
d
i
like
the
feel
balance
sweet
malt
co2
level
and
drinkability
all
except
the
seemingly
artificial
cinnamon
not
too
bad
otherwise
d
despite
my
complaining
this
is
a
decent
imperial
pumpkin
offering
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
its
a
little
sweet
to
drink
much
of
though
it
was
a
pretty
decent
pumpkin
beer
but
the
flavor
just
wasnt
as
good
as
pumking
for
my
personal
tastes
it
still
falls
into
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
available
here
though
so
i
cant
say
i
wont
buy
it
again
though
when
it
comes
back
in
season
feel
and
drinkability
dry
finish
with
cinnamon
lingering
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
heavy
easy
enough
to
drink
but
i
think
that
i
could
only
drink
one
bottle
of
this
the
high
degree
of
spice
would
start
to
irk
me
after
a
while
i
believe
it
would
benefit
from
more
malt
sweetness
to
give
balance
to
the
spices
the
more
i
drink
of
it
the
less
upfront
the
spices
become
i
could
see
drinking
two
bombers
of
this
in
one
sitting
no
more
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
but
not
one
that
im
gonna
rush
to
drink
every
year
this
isnt
a
must
have
every
year
as
the
the
schlafly
wyerbacher
or
pumking
are
pours
a
hazed
orange
amber
with
a
very
thin
white
headskie
easy
drinking
and
smooth
bodied
a
touch
thin
perhaps
but
very
easy
going
pumpkin
beers
i
find
to
be
very
hit
or
miss
and
heavy
seas
has
a
good
one
here
not
over
the
top
with
the
spices
once
can
actually
taste
the
fruit
de
pumpkin
in
the
mix
with
a
slight
sweetness
that
is
immediately
countered
by
a
sharp
but
mellow
hop
balance
i
like
it
anyone
who
has
ever
liked
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
will
like
clipper
city
heavy
seas
the
great
pumpkin
ale
its
solid
from
every
angle
and
is
a
seasonal
that
i
will
definitely
buy
again

me
this
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
modest
ring
of
offwhite
head
and
meager
slivers
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
pleasant
nutmeg
and
sweet
pumpkin
spice
theres
a
curious
herbal
hop
in
there
too
i
think
the
flavor
comes
out
with
something
that
approximates
the
aroma
lots
of
nutmeg
allspice
and
semisweet
pumpkin
and
some
hop
bitterness
that
seems
more
citrus
now
orange
bite
its
a
little
grainy
bright
with
some
lemony
highlights
its
midbodied
plus
with
modest
carbonation
not
highly
drinkable
but
drinks
reasonably
for
an
8
percent
imperial
very
decent
stuff
for
that
seasonal
satisfation
well
done
heavy
seas
d
not
as
good
as
pumpking
but
still
pretty
good
not
necessarily
a
bad
example
of
the
style
or
anything
but
this
needed
to
dial
back
the
spice
and
warmth
a
bit
this
was
worth
at
least
a
try
but
there
are
better
options
out
there
each
fall
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
wasnt
expecting
much
of
this
beer
but
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
good
for
the
style
even
though
there
are
others
that
i
would
choose
first
drinkability
a
good
admirable
though
not
great
pumpkin
brew
but
i
will
certainly
say
it
exceeded
my
modest
expectations
after
the
lackluster
showing
of
the
previous
members
of
the
mutiny
fleet
give
it
a
try
provided
youre
a
fan
of
pumpkin
ales
drinkability
decent
fall
beer
but
one
bomber
bottle
was
enough
in
a
single
session
if
i
had
to
rank
my
personal
top
five
pumpkin
ales
this
would
rank
fifth
southern
tier
pumking
hoppin
frog
frogs
hollow
shipyard
imperial
pumpkin
st
ambroise
then
this
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
well
worth
trying
a
nice
beer
one
of
my
favorite
versions
of
a
pumpkin
ale
i
enjoyed
this
one
as
it
was
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
and
i
havent
had
one
before
not
as
watery
as
other
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
this
year
drinkability
worth
a
try
needs
a
little
more
base
flavor
and
a
little
less
hootch
drinkability
an
interesting
beer
the
high
alcohol
content
pairs
well
with
the
pumpkin
flavoring
this
is
a
good
fall
seasonal
but
not
necessarily
something
ill
get
again
this
is
one
fantastic
pumpkin
ale
loads
of
flavor
but
nothing
that
overwhelms
the
senses
or
dominates
the
other
features
amongst
my
autumn
favorites
found
this
on
in
the
cask
at
rustico
friday
night
so
thought
i
would
give
a
shot
this
was
my
first
clipper
city
beer
and
did
lead
me
to
try
a
few
others
over
the
weekend
in
dc
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
semidark
copper
color
with
a
course
one
finger
head
that
headed
quickly
as
to
be
expected
with
a
cask
the
pumpkin
aroma
was
immediately
noticeable
even
in
a
packed
bar
there
was
also
smokey
hints
to
the
beer
this
beer
the
taste
settled
well
on
the
pallette
and
was
more
pumpkin
flavor
than
pumpkin
pie
flavor
which
was
pleasing
for
a
holiday
varietal
the
smokey
flavor
came
out
in
a
distinctive
clove
finish
was
a
good
cask
for
this
very
fresh
and
full
of
flavor
all
in
all
im
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
ive
never
had
anything
by
clipper
city
before
but
this
is
definitely
a
good
first
impression
i
would
rate
this
right
up
there
with
some
of
my
all
time
favorite
pumpkins
anyway
its
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
like
drinking
the
liquid
canned
pumpkin
pie
filling
of
beers
i
can
see
it
as
a
sipper
alongside
dessert
wines
but
i
might
o
d
on
sugar
if
i
down
a
pint
i
bought
this
beer
at
blacklick
liquors
in
blacklick
near
reynoldsburg
outside
columbus
oh
im
wondering
if
southern
tiers
pumking
wasnt
the
inspiration
here
its
big
on
alcohol
its
big
on
flavor
the
aroma
is
tantalizing
its
creamy
and
its
just
short
of
pumking
which
is
a
compliment
because
pumking
is
king
imo
if
youre
gonna
do
a
pumpkin
ale
make
it
big
and
bold
i
say
and
clipper
city
have
this
is
great
medium
body
carbonation
seems
a
bit
light
some
warming
alcohol
spices
seem
to
fight
each
other
a
bit
rather
than
smoothing
thigs
out
too
earthy
in
the
finish
for
me
having
said
that
this
is
still
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
overall
very
good
pumpkin
ale
1
bomber
is
enough
but
a
good
dessert
beer
notes
a
nice
offer
from
the
sometimes
irregular
clipper
citys
heavy
seas
series
not
a
favorite
as
i
dont
find
anything
too
remarkable
or
pleasing
and
i
would
rather
chase
this
brewery
for
other
offerings
but
this
is
actually
a
rather
balanced
and
well
done
brew
pleasing
to
drink
for
what
the
style
is
typically
after
in
particular
when
it
looks
to
double
or
imperial
designations
this
poured
a
hazy
copper
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
pumpkin
and
coriander
and
lemon
zest
with
some
copper
hops
and
bready
yeast
it
tasted
like
orange
and
lemon
zest
and
pumpkin
with
coriander
and
other
spices
and
a
bit
of
bready
yeast
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
mediocre
pumpkin
ale
the
flavors
and
body
were
good
not
great
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
i
tried
this
on
halloween
for
the
novelty
and
would
only
recommend
it
under
the
same
conditions
poured
a
great
crimson
brown
wiht
good
carbonation
and
a
small
offwhite
head
that
left
lace
on
top
of
a
good
base
aroma
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
clove
and
hints
of
cinnamon
a
medium
body
that
passes
over
smoothly
with
a
a
little
sharpness
thanks
to
spicy
cloveness
a
solid
pumpkin
taste
along
with
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
that
gives
off
a
good
sweetness
a
good
pumpkin
beer
that
is
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
it
had
a
nice
light
carbonation
that
made
it
easy
to
drink
it
felt
very
clean
while
still
being
a
very
thick
beer
overall
it
does
not
overwhelm
the
palate
d
overall
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
i
enjoyed
mine
on
cask
but
i
dont
think
i
could
take
a
bomber
of
this
because
of
the
alcohol
coming
out
as
the
beer
warmed
the
great
pumpkin
is
a
step
up
for
the
dipa
in
my
opinion

pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangish
brown
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
that
gives
way
to
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
and
cloves
with
a
hint
of
nutmeg
as
well
the
taste
is
of
a
sweet
pumpkin
and
possibly
a
brown
sugar
and
a
sweet
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
fairly
high
on
this
the
taste
is
sweet
and
not
bitter
like
some
pumpkin
ales
overall
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
enjoy
them
all
22oz

into
a
duvel
snifter
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
dominated
by
pumpkin
spice
with
slight
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
loads
of
pumpkin
spice
with
slightly
cloying
sweet
malts
as
well
there
is
also
loads
of
boozy
alcohol
that
becomes
even
more
present
as
the
beer
warms
the
beer
is
somewhat
heavy
with
more
alcohol
presence
than
i
would
want
in
a
pumpkin
ale
i
must
say
the
mutiny
fleet
series
is
starting
to
be
one
disappointment
after
another
imperial
beers
are
supposed
to
have
more
flavor
overall
not
just
excessive
alcohol
on
top
of
the
standard
flavors
d
even
though
it
was
a
little
sweeter
than
expected
this
beer
was
fairly
well
balanced
hits
on
all
the
right
notes
but
just
isnt
exceptional
a
solid
brew
that
is
worth
a
try
but
probably
not
a
revisit
beer
is
bitter
sharp
and
spicy
hard
to
drink
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
has
a
warming
alcohol
flavor
that
thins
out
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
low
due
to
odd
bitterness
on
the
back
end
not
a
repeat
but
you
pumpkinheads
may
like
it
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
overall
but
the
alcohol
lowers
the
drinakability
a
little
the
spices
are
also
on
the
high
end
i
think
this
beer
captures
quite
well
the
essence
of
a
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
many
this
season
and
this
one
seems
to
stand
out
its
wellbalanced
spiced
and
works
well
across
the
palate
aside
from
southern
tiers
pumking
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
but
is
not
so
exceptional
or
different
from
other
pumpkin
ales
out
on
the
market
that
i
can
see
any
reason
to
seek
it
out
the
one
glass
i
had
the
other
evening
will
likely
be
the
only
one
i
order
this
season
in
my
tulip
glass
the
beer
was
a
hazy
dark
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
pleasant
aroma
of
pumpkin
and
spice
the
aroma
translated
into
a
stronger
taste
of
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
spice
a
bit
of
warming
alcohol
not
intrusive
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
liquid
pumpkin
pie
very
smooth
great
pumpkin
beer
despite
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
it
seems
to
me
that
whenever
pumpkin
beers
ramp
up
the
alcohol
the
taste
gets
ramped
up
as
well
you
cant
go
wrong
with
trying
this
but
pumking
is
where
its
at
i
appreciate
the
idea
we
need
more
imperial
pumpkins
like
pumking
but
this
one
doesnt
quite
meet
my
expectations
although
this
isnt
my
favorite
imperial
pumpkin
ale
the
subtler
flavors
do
enhance
the
drinkability
of
the
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
return
to
this
one
but
im
glad
i
had
an
opportunity
to
try
it
d
could
have
continued
to
drink
throughout
the
night
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
we
have
tasted
this
year
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
there
are
better
ones
available
d
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
the
spices
are
a
bit
over
the
top
but
i
was
glad
to
try
it
pours
from
the
22oz
bomber
bottle
a
medium
amberis
color
with
a
half
finger
head
that
quickly
dissolved
into
a
light
lacing
i
see
almost
zero
carbonation
going
on
i
can
practically
count
the
bubbles
on
one
hand
the
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
maybe
just
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
1st
sip
brings
a
strong
hint
of
pumpkin
yes
you
can
actually
taste
the
pumpkin
malt
and
spices
there
is
a
strong
bitterness
on
the
finish
from
a
combination
or
hops
alcohol
spice
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
neither
heavy
or
watery
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
could
see
myself
downing
a
few
of
these
on
a
saturday
or
sunday
while
watching
football
overall
a
very
good
beer
imho
a
nice
take
on
a
style
that
seems
to
be
a
loveitorhateit
type
of
beer
i
for
one
love
it
final
thoughts
yep
its
a
pumpkin
beer
alright
some
toasty
pumpkin
flavor
light
on
the
spices
but
ridiculously
sweet
then
the
long
nagging
sweet
pumpkin
flavor
that
turns
somewhat
bitter
and
wont
go
away
takes
a
lot
from
the
drinkability
also
did
i
mention
its
way
too
sweet
its
got
a
nice
alcohol
taste
warmth
and
slight
burn
with
is
unusual
for
a
pumpkin
beer
but
you
know
the
sweetness
dont
think
i
could
stomach
this
again
if
it
were
say
110
the
sweetness
i
might
be
able
to
attempt
this
again
d
pretty
solid
for
8
the
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
behind
all
the
spices
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
this
one
will
make
a
great
fall
beer
this
beer
doesnt
take
the
style
to
the
next
level
but
it
sure
doesnt
do
it
a
disservice
i
really
like
it
and
will
check
it
out
during
the
future
fall
seasons
d
a
nice
enough
pumpkin
but
it
suffers
in
the
complexity
department
lacking
in
pumpkin
flavor
and
not
totally
balancing
the
spice
alcohol
isnt
an
issue
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
clear
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
of
off
white
sudsy
head
that
recedes
relatively
quickly
minimal
spotty
lacing
left
on
the
glass
nose
is
spicey
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
dominate
some
pumpkin
and
malts
filter
in
as
well
taste
is
similar
to
the
other
pumpkin
ales
that
are
heavy
on
the
spicepumpkin
pie
aspect
though
this
one
seems
a
bit
off
balance
spices
seem
to
fight
the
pumpkin
flavoring
rather
than
compliment
them
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
dominate
the
flavor
with
pumpkin
and
malts
trying
to
fight
through
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
mild
carbonation
thick
and
chewy
feel
to
the
body
this
was
a
decent
brew
but
ive
had
better
offerings
of
the
style
drinkabilty
although
im
fairly
new
to
these
imperial
pumpkin
brews
i
like
this
showing
from
clipper
city
the
spiciness
really
sets
this
apart
from
any
other
pumpkin
on
the
shelf
although
this
may
be
its
downfall
since
it
has
alot
more
of
a
spice
feature
then
a
pumpkin
taste
otherwise
you
still
get
a
good
pumpkin
backdrop
and
you
still
get
a
8
brew
thats
decently
drinkable
and
loaded
with
interesting
qualities
i
liked
this
way
more
then
their
imperial
octoberfest
and
will
definetley
have
a
few
more
of
these
as
the
fall
continues
on
a
solid
pumpkin
that
i
really
enjoyed
the
more
i
had
but
i
would
not
rate
it
on
par
with
the
top
dogs
still
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
drink
in
the
fall
i
enjoyed
the
imperial
part
with
the
higher
abv
nice
nice
medium
body
with
lots
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
pretty
malty
for
the
style
with
a
lot
of
pumpkin
flavor
cinnamon
brown
sugar
vanilla
ginger
and
nutmeg
the
spiciness
is
pretty
prominent
but
doesnt
overpower
the
pumpkin
lasting
into
a
dry
finish
this
one
is
thick
and
complex
and
the
abv
is
very
well
masked
making
it
pretty
drinkable
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
pretty
good
full
and
rich
mouthfeel
very
tasty
and
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
solid
attempt
at
a
pumpkin
beer
by
a
brewery
that
usually
turns
out
good
beers
it
doesnt
do
much
to
differentiate
itself
from
others
in
the
style
but
whats
done
is
done
well
worth
a
shot
overal
this
was
an
enjoyable
easily
drinkable
brew
the
only
qualm
is
that
a
hallow
medicinal
aftertaste
ensuesi
want
the
warmth
of
a
pumpkin
pie
drinkability
strong
and
more
of

a

beer
they
all
run

including
this
one
i
need
more

less
spice
actually
suprisingly
tasty
after
not
being
too
impressed
with
the
aroma
easy
to
drink
for
an
imperial
pumpkin
dangerously
so
nice
mix
of
spices
not
picking
up
too
much
pumpkin
flavor
but
im
not
complaining
still
cant
believe
that
the

is

it

very
overly
pumpkin
or
spicy
for
that
matter
this
beer
doesnt
really
compare
in
the
over
the
top
pumpkin
flavors
of
something
like
pumpking
i
dont
usually
care
for
pumpkin
beers
that
much
so
this
is
actually
nice
in
its
restraint
and
balance
certainly
worth
a
try
for
3
99
i
think
its
a
nice
balance
of
malt
hops
and
spice
but
as
with
most
pumpkin
beers
i
just
dont
get
the
amount
of
pumpkin
i
think
should
be
there
overall
a
nice
fall
beer
md
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
metallic
note
to
the
taste
is
a
bit
off
putting
overall
its
a
good
beer
there
are
much
better
pumpkin
ales
or
heavy
seas
offerings
but
tasty
very
very
good
pumpkin
beer
if
youre
a
fan
of
these
kinds
of
beer
than
plz
at
least
do
me
the
favor
and
try
this
one
i
happened
to
come
across
a
whole
case
of
these
in
almost
april
and
lets
just
say
ill
b
buying
the
whole
thing
anyone
who
likes
weyerbacher
pumpkin
ale
will
love
this
it
tastes
similar
but
packs
more
of
a
punch
hopefully
my
brother
sends
me
another
overall
this
is
a
remarkable
beer
i
love
the
candied
pumpkin
and
ginger
flavor
as
well
as
the
blended
bourbon
and
vanilla
flavors
very
very
good
im
getting
two
bottle
so
this
at
least
next
year
one
to
drink
right
away
and
one
or
two
to
age
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
imperial
ales
you
really
get
the
flavor
of
both
and
i
have
to
say
its
probably
my
favorite
heavy
seas
brew
my
god
i
cant
stand
pumpkins
and
i
love
this
one
it
has
to
be
served
at
the
correct
temp
around
50
degrees
or
a
little
warmer
to
really
bring
out
the
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
but
does
the
aging
ever
pair
with
the
pumpkin
and
spices
pumpkins
are
a
style
i
cant
generally
abide
everyone
has
different
tastes
but
i
enjoy
bourbon
barrel
aged
beers
so
when
i
saw
this
at
the
white
oak
tavern
tonight
well
i
had
to
get
a
taste
after
a
taste
i
ordered
a
full
10
oz
goblet
and
savored
every
drop
this
was
so
good
just
the
right
pumpkin
and
not
bitter
very
strong
had
a
22oz
and
was
wasted
lol
o
meh
a
pretty
average
beer
tastes
like
pumpkin
bourbon
is
about
undetectable
if
you
see
it
and
you
love
pumpkin
you
might
love
it
but
otherwise
dont
bother
owhat
can
i
say
i
love
pumpkin
beers
and
this
is
a
yummy
one

this
brew
is
great
stuff
everything
i
hoped
it
would
be
an
more
it
has
an
excellent
malty
base
built
into
the
base
beer
and
the
bourbon
barrel
vanilla
and
slight
oak
play
off
the
subtle
pumpkin
pie
spices
superbly
very
well
done

d
ehhh
its
nothing
special
the
bourbon
is
too
weak
in
the
nose
and
too
strong
in
the
taste
this
needs
a
bigger
malty
backbone
to
do
well
in
a
barrel
overall
this
beer
could
obviously
get
better
with
age
might
have
to
buy
several
bottles
to
store
on
the
pantry
hoppy
afterbite
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
ever
experienced
and
i
am
not
a
pumpkin
fan
at
all
excellent
job
on
the
aging
of
this
ale
wierd
after
taste
this
is
a
big
beer
it
doesnt
feel
like
it
though
ive
had
plenty
beers
in
this
abv
range
that
are
not
shy
of
warning
of
their
potency
this
one
is
different
comes
in
syrupy
instantly
coating
your
tongue
finishes
extremely
smooth
and
leaves
no
traces
of
hotness
ive
never
experienced
such
from
a
10
abv
adjunct
beer
before
pours
opaque
amber
in
color
with
one
finger
of
beige
head
smells
like
the
spices
that
go
into
pumpkin
pie
but
pumpkin
is
faint
mouthfeel
is
good
taste
is
like
a
bite
of
fresh
pumpkin
pie
with
nice
balance
of
spices
and
pumpkin
finish
is
sweet
sugar
and
more
pie
flavor
overall
pleasantly
surprised
cant
wait
to
have
the
next
bottle
pours
a
deep
dark
orange
in
color
sweet
smells
of
vanilla
brown
sugar
nutmeg
rum
soaked
raisins
the
taste
followed
the
nose
closely
albeit
more
subdued
the
sweetness
wasnt
cloying
the
beer
is
made
to
stand
out
in
this
concoction
the
spices
are
just
an
accent
the
taste
of
oak
is
slightly
present
in
the
taste
also
the
sharpness
and
burn
of
the
alcohol
is
reminiscent
of
a
brandy
or
bourbon
and
effective
at
breaking
up
the
sweetness
in
this
beer
medium
bodied
not
overly
bubbly
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
to
bottle
condition
for
2
years
overall
i
prefer
this
beer
over
pumking
because
it
isnt
as
sweet
overly
spiced
recommended
for
pumpkinyam
beer
lovers

it
would
be
a
really
good
pumpkin
ale
if
it
werent
so
flabby
not
bad
but
not
great
either
good
seasonal
pumpkin
ale
little
too
light
and
lacking
in
pumpkin
pie
for
my
taste
smooth
and
that
golden
orange
brown
color
on
draft
little
to
no
head
smooth
and
light
in
the
mouth
finished
clean
just
needs
more
of
that
pie
taste
serving
type
bottle
was
able
to
get
my
hands
on
a
bottle
of
the
2014
before
it
was
released
very
good
flavor
strong
hints
of
pumpkin
and
fall
spices
velvety
smooth
and
boozy
like
some
sort
of
creamy
barleywine
tastefully
restrained
spicing
just
lets
a
really
well
crafted
strong
ale
shine
through
the
bourbon
barrel
isnt
too
strong
either
vanilla
from
the
bourbon
barrel
complements
the
pumpkin
pie
spice
really
nicely
certainly
not
your
typical
pumpkin
ale
and
certainly
more
subtle
and
restrained
than
i
was
expecting
from
a
beer
this
big
in
abv
a
surprisingly
elegant
ale
the
perfect
weather
for
a
big
pumpkin
ale
here
in
nc
today
pours
into
an
imperial
nonic
a
deep
burnt
orange
in
fused
copper
with
a
sticky
off
white
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
it
settles
pretty
quickly
big
alcohol
and
pie
spices
in
the
nosesmells
like
an
alcoholic
doozy
and
the
aromas
are
correctcinnamon
and
clove
flavors
with
a
big
spiced
rumlike
sweetness
with
its
mild
molassesvanilla
and
brown
sugar
notes
whoo
this
isnt
the
biggest
pumpkin
ale
i
have
had
but
it
tastes
like
it
might
be
i
get
more
of
a
rum
alcohol
flavor
than
i
do
the
bourbon
barrelhmm
odd
overall
this
is
definitely
a
beer
i
will
enjoy
again
many
times
but
nothing
still
compares
to
pumking
deep
pumpkin
spices
like
cinnamon
and
clove
dominate
the
start
of
this
beer
a
good
deal
of
dry
oakiness
comes
out
as
it
warms
which
leaves
a
bit
of
bitterness
a
good
beer
but
i
have
had
better
o
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
in
this
beer
i
expected
it
to
be
rather
hot
considering
the
abv
and
the
fact
that
it
is
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
but
it
turns
out
to
be
real
sneaky
in
its
strength
very
enjoyable
with
a
nice
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
without
being
cloyingly
sweet
overall
this
is
one
of
the
more
complex
pumpkin
style
beers
ive
had
more
of
a
sipper
than
most
pumpkin
ales
for
the
lower
abv
types
are
often
very
drinkable
the
best
pumpkin
beer
out
there
and
its
an
asskicker
too
great
spices
and
cloves
in
the
taste
but
you
get
a
wonderful
dose
of
malt
and
bourbon
flavors
as
well
sip
this
get
warm
from
the
alcohol
and
enjoy
a
nice
evening
in
the
fall
with
this
beer
i
had
the
gabf
2013
rum
barrel
aged
version
and
i
loved
it
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
barrel
aging
especially
bourbon
or
whiskey
as
this
beer
usually
is
as
the
liquor
usually
takes
over
too
much
for
my
taste
using
the
sweeter
rum
and
already
being
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beer
it
was
the
best
thing
i
tasted
at
the
festival
been
looking
for
a
rum
aged
beer
for
awhile
and
this
was
a
great
first
impression
of
using
rum
for
a
sweet
sample
of
awesomeness
o
this
was
very
good
most
barrel
aged
pumpkin
beers
are
overpowered
by
the
barrel
this
one
was
not
the
base
beer
is
very
flavorful
and
mixed
with
the
oak
nicely
to
provide
a
dessertlike
sweetness
well
done
very
attractive
pour
the
differentiation
between
this
and
other
pumpkin
ales
seems
to
be
the
ubiquitous
bourbon
barrel
no
pumpkin
tasted
only
bourbon
and
clove
rating
based
on
trueness
to
style
too
boozy
for
its
abv
nice
flavor
and
the
pumpkin
is
real
nice
i
just
feel
like
i
have
had
too
many
too
many
pumpkin
ales
that
were
far
better
o
a
wonderful
pumpkin
ale
it
has
the
balance
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
any
pumpkin
head
would
enjoy
yet
provides
the
sort
of
class
a
bourbon
barrel
freak
would
appreciate
this
was
an
interesting
beer
and
very
enjoyable
i
was
almost
shocked
at
how
good
heavy
seas
did
with
this
by
far
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
them
ill
buy
it
again
next
year
as
well
prost
overall
its
a
pumpkin
beer
that
exemplifies
the
style
but
i
still
feel
that
this
one
could
push
the
envelope
a
little
further
a
bit
more
bourbon
and
pumpkin
flavor
an
excellent
ba
pumpkin
beer
i
think
this
would
also
lend
itself
well
to
rum
barrel
aging
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
the
bourbon
offers
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
standard
pumpkin
beers
out
there
ultimately
it
just
needs
more
flavor
both
pumpkin
and
bourbon
this
is
a
fine
pumpkin
ale
the
only
flaw
is
that
the
bourbon
and
oak
characteristics
seem
to
be
absent
in
my
opinion
i
personally
dont
think
aging
this
beer
will
make
it
improve
m
medium
leading
to
full
this
is
one
pumpkin
ale
that
can
be
skipped
over
found
this
gem
at
a
local
coop
and
had
an
open
mind
as
i
havent
seen
this
brewerys
products
around
here
amazing
aroma
of
vanilla
pumpkin
and
nutmeg
escapes
the
bottle
and
it
pours
a
hazy
redamber
half
finger
of
white
head
that
dissipates
bourbon
barrel
aging
apparent
on
tasting
with
warm
boozy
aftertaste
enhancing
the
vanilla
pumpkin
and
balanced
nutmeg
overall
my
favorite
of
the
2013
pumpkin
beeraleimperial
ale
class
thus
far
but
i
would
like
to
do
a
side
by
side
comparison
with
good
gourd
a
pretty
decent
imperial
pumpkin
ale
and
one
that
i
will
probably
pick
up
again
next
year
when
it
comes
out
overall
the
most
enjoyable
aspect
of
this
beer
was
its
aroma
this
initially
came
across
as
quite
booze
and
metallic
but
as
it
warmed
those
notes
faded
allowing
the
beauty
of
the
spice
and
the
gourd
to
flourish
that
said
the
flavoring
to
follow
lacked
the
punch
that
weve
come
to
expect
from
these
big
oaky
pumpkin
beers
the
oak
was
actually
great
and
almost
overly
so
because
of
how
sour
it
was
but
the
pumpkin
was
rather
flat
this
is
not
to
the
fault
of
the
brewer
but
rather
to
the
fault
of
the
product
itself
as
it
is
inherently
not
very
spicy
or
savory
in
its
flavoring
there
was
however
enough
spice
added
to
keep
things
interesting
and
to
meet
the
wood
in
full
this
was
a
nice
beer
for
sure
and
we
are
glad
to
have
had
it
fresh
while
the
bourbon
barreling
is
in
full
season
but
we
suggest
you
wait
a
bit
if
you
want
a
cooler
more
buttery
and
smoothsipping
beverage
o
the
english
malts
are
delicious
on
the
rare
occasions
that
they
are
allowed
to
peek
through
the
iron
curtain
of
spices
the
barrel
flavors
are
comforting
and
enticing
as
well
tone
back
the
spicing
by
half
and
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
but
as
it
stands
its
a
bit
much
spice
dominates
the
aroma
but
seems
to
be
subdued
by
the
bourbon
character
in
the
flavor
very
nice
take
on
the
style
not
overly
sweet
with
a
pretty
decent
pumpkin
presence
though
the
balance
is
toward
spices
the
bourbon
adds
nice
complexity
and
that
10
percent
is
surprisingly
well
hidden
the
banana
and
cola
character
im
perceiving
is
somewhat
disappointing
but
i
think
its
just
a
combo
of
other
flavors
namely
ginger
wow
perhaps
aged
a
bit
too
long
in
those
bourbon
barrels
i
like
a
bba
brew
but
this
is
just
more
boozy
than
i
would
like
gonna
give
it
some
time
to
warm
and
see
if
it
improves
a
clear
brandy
copper
color
with
a
modest
white
ring
of
head
and
weak
lacing
the
aroma
offers
brandy
as
well
vanilla
oak
and
sweet
marshmallow
cherry
the
flavor
brings
an
instant
idea
of
pumpkin
brandy
with
some
low
lying
malt
and
more
cherry
sweetness
and
vanilla
oak
very
tasty
in
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
reserved
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
very
solid
and
a
bit
different
for
a
sweet
seasonal
with
high
octane
the
booze
is
a
bit
high
but
its
worth
it
not
really
what
i
expected
i
expected
a
thicked
bodied
heavily
spiced
pumpkin
ale
that
had
some
bourbon
notes
this
is
almost
the
opposite
its
light
the
main
flavor
is
the
bourbon
and
the
pumpkin
profile
is
subtle
it
is
a
nice
blend
though
the
spice
works
quite
well
with
the
bourbon
750ml
poured
into
tulip
glass
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
head
nose
is
malt
and
spice
taste
starts
with
malts
and
spices
mixes
with
oak
and
finishes
with
pumpkin
and
bourbon
medium
body
lingers
nicely
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
on
the
back
end
very
enjoyable
entry
into
the
pumpkin
beer
world
would
definitely
buy
again
overall
a
boozy
malty
experience
not
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
pumpkin
overall
i
found
that
the
beer
became
markedly
better
once
it
had
warmed
up
nice
vanilla
and
bourbon
flavors
and
a
good
amount
of
pumpkin
spices
pours
dark
orange
with
a
single
finger
off
white
head
smell
is
full
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
oaky
bourbon
taste
starts
with
lots
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
again
sweet
potato
some
marshmallow
sweet
finishes
with
an
oaky
bourbon
not
too
hot
plenty
of
malt
slight
hop
presence
this
is
well
balanced
but
neither
of
the
flavors
are
intense
enough
imo
i
did
really
enjoy
it
though
o
overall
we
say
its
an
outstanding
beer
the
smell
definitely
brings
out
the
pumpkin
but
the
taste
doesnt
continue
that
probably
not
a
beer
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
and
not
just
for
the
abv
10
but
definitely
good
for
us
to
split
another
bottle
at
some
point
overall
interesting
this
seems
to
serve
bourbon
drinkers
well
as
it
really
took
the
bourbon
flavor
but
pumpkin
beer
fans
may
not
find
what
they
are
looking
for
od
alcohol
is
hidden
well
getting
most
of
the
taste
and
not
that
much
burn
probably
wont
get
again
but
an
interesting
beer
a
bourbon
barrel
pumpkin
ale
that
poured
dark
like
a
stout
and
wasnt
too
syrupy
the
head
was
less
than
1
and
its
mouthfeel
was
a
mixture
of
pumpkin
and
bourbon
you
could
taste
the
variety
of
spices
as
well
as
the
oak
casked
barrel
that
it
sat
in
at
9
abv
it
didnt
have
a
crazy
bite
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
someone
who
is
looking
for
a
mix
of
pumpkin
and
bourbon

pumpkin
ale

success
at
harmonizing

hop
and
squash
earthiness
and
bakers
rack
spices
makes
it
exceptionally

especially
considering
its

like
most
of
this

offerings
this
is
well
made
and
reasonably
priced
an
easy
one
to
recommend
the
taste
never
reaches
the
level
of
sweet
as
there
bittering
hops
counteracting
any
sweetness
that
might
be
present
finishes
clean
and
the
hops
balance
the
pumpkin
spices
with

interesting
take
on
the
style
those
looking
for
a
sweet
pumpkin
pie
bomb
probably
wont
care
for
this
one
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
that
is
slightly
off

with

was

down

the
beer
no

and
the
head
did
not
stick
around
long
s
great
pumpkin
flavor
but
lots
of
spices
there
was
a
malty

but
no
creaminess

warming
solid
cold
and
after
warming
up
a
bit
with
aggressive
spice
and
pumpkins
no
hops
whatsoever
as
expected
aftertaste
of
some
dry
spices
and
an
earthiness
like
a
wet
grain
tasted
more
bitter
than
sweet
solid
but
not
greatmostly
nice
because
it
wasnt
imbalanced
like
a
lot
of
other
pumpkin
ales
m
mouthwatering
and
mediumbodied
you
do
feel
that
8
abv
o
pretty
good
and
better
than
most
pumpkins
nicely
balanced
and
not
overly
spiced
nor
supersweet
but
a
bit
too
much
astringentbitter
flavor
for
me
and
you
could
taste
the
higher
content
more
than
other
imperial
pumpkins
one
of
the
better
pumpkins
going
in
the
early
season
here
its
great
not
over
spiced
which
i
love
but
also
not
under
flavored
featuring
the
pumpkins
better
than
most
others
i
have
seen
just
a
light
nutmeg
hit
in
there
and
maybe
a
little
honey
or
maple
sweetness
as
it
finishes
the
alcohol
is
warming
and
when
the
beer
is
room
temperature
it
burns
just
enough
maybe
its
still
hot
outside
but
this
beer
brings
me
to
fall
i
like
the
beers
that
take
me
someplace
and
this
one
definitely
does
that
rich
caramel
malts
and
even
a
hint
of
rye
spice
in
this
although
i
question
its
presence
it
is
a
little
thin
in
body
for
its
size
so
the
booze
stands
out
more
than
it
should
towards
the
end

close

its

overall
a

ill
try
certain

i
recall
shipyard
pumpkin
being
the
first
of
its
kind
and
i
concluded
this
wasnt
for
me
then
came
samual
adams
pumpkin
overall
i
found
this
was
an
improvement
today
i
had

privilege
tasting
long
trails
imperial
pumpkin
on
tap
now
were
talking
it
was
cloudy
and
amber
in
color
taste
was
a
near
perfect

of
pumpkin
and
spices
i
am
scheduled
to
try
samual
adams
fat
jack
this
time
next
week
i
almost
cant
see
how
it
could
be
any
better
than
this
one
but
well
see
overall
a
nicely
flavored
pumpkin
ale
that
is
enjoyable
on
a
cool
afternoon
easy
to
consume
and
hits
the
tastebuds
just
right
d
love
the
artwork
on
the
label
but
i
guess
thats
the
point
of
the
brush
barrel
series
excellent
appearance
and
aroma
things
drop
off
a
bit
in
terms
of
flavor
and
its
still
a
rock
solid
beer
and
different
lives
up
to
its
imperial
label
not
your
typical
pumpkin
ale
by
any
means
but
thats
okay
just
not
sure
this
is
something
i
would
recommend
nor
indulge
in
with
regularity
considering
ive
had
several
other
oaked
aged
beers
primarily
in
bourbon
barrels
this
beer
was
great
heavier
on
the
pumpkin
and
all
spice
flavor
with
not
too
much
of
an
oak
flavor
the
beer
while
holding
a
higher
abv
did
not
have
too
much
bite
and
was
on
the
syrupy
side
of
things
something
i
appreciate
poured
with
an
aggressive
pour
and
it
had
just
over
1

with
a
mild

warmth
in
the
finish
it
could
use
a
little
more
pumpkin
mouthfeel
is
fairly
rich
the
beer
is
not
too
thin
or
weak
nice
job
on
a
style
that
often
is
too
overthetop
for
me
not
horrible
for
a
pumpkin
ale
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
good
malty
flavor
up
front
balanced
with
the
pumpkin
and
the
spices
unique
in
how
much
bitterness
appears
in
the
finish
interesting
o
did
not
really
enjoy
this
one
tasted
mostly
generic
nothing
crazy
about
this
beer
and
not
a
lot
of
flavors
coming
through
better
than
avg
pumpkin
but
not
by
a
lot
hazy
like
most
long
trails
slightly
sweet
could
be
less
so
for
my
tastes
but
not
overspiced
which
is
a
downfall
of
many
pumpkins
good
not
great

all
the

pumpkin
and
all
the

actually

another

another

overall
meh
pumpkin
is
vegetal
and
gourd
like
not
so
tasty
as
well
as
the
sweet
molasses
and
brown
sugar
as
well
as
the
bitter
tannic
spices
etc
not
a
very
tasty
beer
pumpkin
is
getting
a
bit
overdone
seems
like
everything
is
pumpkin
spice
these
days
but
like
everything
else
they
do
long
trail
has
produced
a
nice
version
of
a
pumpkin
ale
balanced
not
overly
sweet
with
the
right
amount
of
spice
well
done
nice
basic
pumpkin
beer
a
little
sweetness
some
pumpkin
and
little
spice
for
the
price
i
would
highly
recommend
this
unless
you
like
a
lot
of

first
few
sips
were
pretty
good

usually
i
go
for
pumpkin
beers
that
have
more
of
a
stronger
pumpkin
flavor
but
i
like
how
long
trails
pumpkin
beer
is
done
it
definitely
weighs
more
on
the
spiced
side
but
i
really
enjoy
how
it
seems
to
have
sweeter
notes
of
brown
sugar
as
opposed
to
more
potent
hints
of
cinnamon
the
flavors
of
clove
nutmeg
and
brown
sugar
give
it
a
good
body
and
finishes
with
a
slight
bit
of
pumpkin
thrown
in
there
to
me
its
nothing
too
original
but
has
respectable
elements
to
it
my
first
pumpkin
brew
of
the
year
this
year
coming
mid
august
earlier
every
year
but
i
am
okay
with
that
and
okay
with
this
being
the
start
of
hopefully
a
long
pumpkin
ale
season
its
got
a
cool
spice
profile
thats
not
super
autumnal
more
spice
than
squash
and
a
sort
of
lightness
to
it
maybe
from
honey
rather
than
molasses
less
raw
more
refined
allspice
and
anise
are
there
and
the
pumpkin
appears
to
be
more
roasted
than
raw
a
nice
orange
rusty
caramel
color
a
little
haze
to
it
and
a
short
and
short
lived
tan
head
it
smells
and
tastes
quite
robust
but
i
dont
find
it
overdone
on
the
spices
and
it
has
a
real
natural
and
organic
sort
of
earthy
feel
to
it
not
artificially
flavored
at
all
i
find
the
body
to
be
far
thinner
than
i
like
in
the
style
maybe
too
light
for
cold
weather
but
it
helps
me
drink
it
in
this
summer
weather
carbonation
is
there
but
there
is
a
missing
middle
to
the
feel
and
a
strange
tannic
finish
mouthfeel
would
be
its
lowest
score
i
think
if
that
feature
were
not
just
removed
from
this
site
if
it
comes
back
i
will
update
if
not
look
elsewhere
for
a
fuller
bodied
pumpkin
ale
had
the
best
pop

very
good

good
drinkability
if
you
wanted
to
pound
down
a
sixes
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
overall
a
rather
sweet
but
enjoyable
pumpkin
ale
with
a
nice
blend
of
roasted
pumpkin
and
spice
overall
rather
easy
drinking
and
tasty
i
was
pleasantly
impressed
by
this
a
good
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
o
looks
nice
and
smell
is
decent
but
flavor
is
really
off
unfortunately
taste
is
big
pumpkin
up
front
followed
by
bitter
and
sweet
spice
ginger
nutmeg
cinnamon
it
has
a
thick
sweet
malt
flavor
with
some
subtle
caramel
notes
this
is
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
it
flirts
with
a
good
amount
of
spice
without
being
cloying
this
was
the
first
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
this
fall
so
my
opinion
may
be
slightly
favorable
but
i
really
like
this
beer
its
got
a
nice
even
pumpkin
aroma
and
flavor
thats
not
overstated
and
is
incredibly
refreshing
pumpkin
doesnt
dominate
the
palate
like
some
other
beers
of
this
style
tend
to
do
im
thinking
shipyard
pumpkinhead
and
it
doesnt
taste
like
pumpkin
pie
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
long
trail
beers
and
i
was
glad
to
see
this
in
the
fall
mix
pack
an
excellent
start
to
pumpkin
beer
season
the
good
news
is
as
a
pumpkin
this
is
a
big
glass
of
okay
i
still
looked
forward
to
getting
done
so
i
could
have
other
tastes
in
the
sampler
case
oh
yeah
two
of
these
have
a
pretty
good
kick
this
brew
has
a
solid
drinkability
level
and
captures
the
flavors
of
the
fall
season
quite
well
overall
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
finish
theres
something
funky
with
the
way
the
malt
plays
with
the
spices
that
doesnt
quite
work
the
beer
starts
off
nice
has
a
strange
combination
of
flavors
in
the
middle
and
finishes
great
wouldnt
go
back
to
it
the
way
it
is
but
a
slightly
tweaked
recipe
could
be
great
overall
not
very
impressive
long
trails
imperial
pumpkin
is
worth
looking
into
but
i
would
pass
over
this
one
this
is
an
okay
pumpkin
beer
unfortunately
it
was
a
disappointment
as
are
most
pumpkin
beer
as
always
its
worth
it
to
try
it
for
yourself
but
there
are
other
better
pumpkin
beers
than
this
o
a
good
pumpkin
that
gets
a
little
spice
heavy
that
said
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
tend
towards
a
malty
bitterness
which
makes
a
good
pumpkin
ale
i
am
not
blown
away
but
i
am
certainly
impressed
this
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
murkey
brown
colored
body
with
a
small
white
head
that
layed
down
to
a
nice
lace
the
smell
has
a
aroma
of
spices
with
a
little
hint
of
pumpkin
to
it
the
taste
is
spices
up
front
followed
by
a
little
pumpkin
flavor
and
some
malt
on
the
back
of
the
tonuge
the
mouth
feel
is
nice
easy
drinker
and
overall
a
good
pumpkin
beer
d
not
too
shabby
a
solid
slightly
above
average
pumpkin
ale
very
quaffable
outstanding
appearance
and
slightly
above
average
in
all
other
facets
i
would
never
turn
one
down
but
this
wont
be
one
of
my
go
to
pumpkin
ales
either
o
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
but
nothing
extraordinary
the
burnt
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
really
brings
the
experience
down
and
the
aroma
is
mild
on
spices
worth
trying
if
you
are
looking
for
a
darker
tasting
pumpkin
beer
but
there
are
better
options
in
general
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
quite
sessionable
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
buy
a
six
pack
its
good
to
see
long
trail
finally
putting
a
pumpkin
ale
out
as
its
a
seasonal
style
that
would
seem
to
be
right
in
their
wheel
house
and
this
was
a
nice
example
of
the
style
too
with
an
easy
feel
balanced
flavors
and
a
fresh
pumpkin
character
that
carried
this
well
ill
definitely
be
keeping
an
eye
out
again
for
this
one
overall
nice
beer
with
a
very
nice
pumpkin
flavor
and
isnt
overly
sweet
and
has
a
nice
bitterness
to
bring
it
all
together
goes
down
smooth
doesnt
offend
the
palate
and
could
be
enjoyed
in
multiples
may
drink
again
but
i
recommend
it
cheers
o
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
ale
because
it
isnt
overly
sweet
or
packed
with
too
many
spices
o
enjoyable
and
it
is
a
pleasant
change
for
the
style
that
the
beer
is
not
really
too
sweet
enjoyable
but
not
sure
that
i
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
session
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
brownorangeish
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
strong
of
pumpkin
and
spices
taste
is
mellow
compared
to
the
smell
pumpkin
a
touch
of
spice
kind
of
mild
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
of
all
the
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
this
fall
this
one
is
one
of
the
more
disappointing
ones
if
you
like
your
pumpkin
spice
more
subtle
and
the
beer
a
bit
more
on
the
pale
side
this
one
is
probably
for
you
long
trail
has
a
different
take
on
the
style
i
just
wish
the
pumpkin
spice
or
breadiness
would
have
popped
some
more
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
at
the
start
but
then
explosively
bitter
at
the
end
but
it
is
not
what
i
would
call
a
hop
bitterness
it
was
more
like
a
lingering
potato
thing
sadly
the
usually
reliable
long
trail
slips
up
a
bit
on
this
one
but
it
is
still
reasonably
drinkable
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
a
great
beer
to
try
its
not
your
typical
pumpkin
beer
d
good
pumpkin
beer
but
not
great
pumpkin
spice
flavor
not
much
else
going
on
pass
for
me
going
forward
o
a
pretty
mediocre
middleoftheroad
pumpkin
ale
to
further
flood
the
market
with
the
5
5
abv
and
clean
crisp
nature
of
the
beer
make
it
an
easy
choice
as
far
as
session
pumpkin
ales
go
however
its
a
bit
too
sharp
bland
and
hoppy
to
be
a
truly
enjoyable
rich
fall
brew
id
be
unlikely
to
turn
it
down
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
outside
of
the
variety
pack
if
it
were
available
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
offering
i
know
it
is
not
an
imperial
pumpkin
but
it
really
lacks
character
golden
orange
hue
with
about
1
finger
of
head
on
it
smells
spicy
and
sweet
maybe
too
sweet
on
the
nose
for
my
liking
taste
matches
the
nose
for
the
most
part
malty
and
a
lot
of
all
spice
and
clovemedium
mouthfeel
just
oknot
terrible
or
anything
like
that
good
for
someone
that
drink
average
ales
and
wants
to
try
a
pumpkin
beer
cheers
this
beer
pours
out
clear
and
slightly
orange
in
color
smells
of
spiced
pumpkin
and
a
little
bit
like
a
pumpkin
pie
the
taste
is
less
pumpkiny
than
the
nose
but
the
body
and
taste
are
still
quite
good
overall
a
pretty
decent
fall
seasonal
worth
at
least
giving
a
shot
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
finger
of
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
but
left
a
touch
of
lace
behind
the
nose
is
definitely
pumpkinlike
not
much
of
a
pumpkin
taste
to
this
offering
the
finish
is
pleasantly
dry
not
bad
but
not
terribly
memorable
i
had
tried
the
long
trail
pumpkin
last
year
and
was
impressed
by
the
rich
smooth
pumpkin
taste
the
spiced
pumpkin
flavor
lingered
for
a
long
time
so
impressed
that
i
ran
out
and
picked
up
a
case
this
year
as
soon
as
it
was
available
this
years
beer
is
vastly
different
than
last
year
considerably
less
pumpkin
flavor
and
a
harsh
bitterness
than
wreaks
havoc
on
the
taste
buds
i
even
tried
increasing
the
sweetness
by
dipping
the
glass
in
cinnamon
sugar
did
not
help
unfortunately
as
with
many
of
the
pumpkin
ales
you
really
need
to
sample
the
beer
each
year
before
you
commit
to
a
supply
of
it
pity
the
long
trail
is
such
a
disappointment
this
year
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
copperbrown
coloring
with
no
head
aromas
of
roasted
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
smells
very
smooth
and
rich
flavors
are
sharply
roasted
with
a
rough
backbone
the
pumpkin
flavors
are
overshadowed
by
the
roasting
and
increased
carbonation
giving
the
beer
a
very
sharp
feeling
in
mouth
roasty
pumpkin
sweet
aftertaste
with
extremely
mild
spicing
a
light
crisp
quick
finish
i
was
intrigued
by
the
smell
but
it
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
past
that
point
i
was
surprised
with
this
beer
and
i
think
it
rivals
some
of
the
better
made
pumpkin
beers
out
there
it
was
the
last
one
in
my
beer
store
so
maybe
its
more
popular
than
i
had
imagined
anyways
good
beer
and
definitely
a
sessionable
halloween
beer
o
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
better
pumpkins
out
there
from
what
ive
had
ill
have
no
problem
getting
the
rest
of
these
down
o
actually
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
seems
like
it
is
new
to
the
fall
packs
id
get
this
again
and
at
the
price
of
a
12
pack
it
is
a
nice
deal
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
a
really
nice
cross
between
a
pumpkin
beer
and
a
brown
ale
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
pumpkin
flavor
but
im
not
complaining
overall
solid
thin
brisk
body
yet
feels
kind
of
full
in
the
mouth
light
toasted
malt
sweetness
followed
by
pumpkin
flavor
and
its
accompanying
spices
finishes
with
spicy
with
a
linger
well
done
pie
crust
taste
in
the
mouth
subtle
yet
complex
with
waves
of
flavor
and
great
drinkability
not
an
in
your
face
pumpkin
but
definitely
nice
for
some
fall
daytime
drinking
a
nice
fall
session
choice
more
of
an
ambermarzen
type
of
ale
the
pumpkin
spice
is
too
light
i
do
like
the
bear
carting
the
pumpkins
on
the
label
for
what
its
worth
a
pumpkin
ale
that
you
can
actually
have
a
few
of
without
tasting
clove
all
night
what
a
concept
meh
im
not
sure
what
theyre
aiming
for
here
but
its
not
anything
that
i
want
to
drink
often
reminds
me
too
much
of
a
marzen
o
an
average
pumpkin
beer
nothing
over
the
top
or
exciting
easy
to
drink
purchased
a
six
pack
at
the
brewery
the
day
it
was
released
on
august
1st
copper
in
color
with
visible
carbonation
light
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
ginger
and
nutmeg
followed
by
pumpkin
thin
and
fairly
carbonated
mouthfeel
the
first
taste
is
of
ginger
as
it
hits
the
tongue
the
finish
is
mild
pumpkin
with
a
touch
of
cinnamon
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
not
overpowering
and
not
too
sweet
easy
drinking
for
the
style
pours
clear
medium
amber
producing
slightly
over
a
finger
of
beige
mostly
finely
bubbled
but
shortlived
head
that
leaves
no
lace
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
roasted
malts
heavy
pumpkin
pie
spices
some
vegetable
pumpkin
like
many
pumpkin
ales
the
spices
are
so
heavy
that
the
more
subtle
aromas
are
somewhat
subdued
taste
is
thinner
than
the
nose
is
a
little
watery
for
my
taste
but
has
more
malt
roast
than
sweet
caramel
cinnamon
ginger
other
pumpkin
pie
spices
stand
out
with
low
pumpkin
presence
all
flavors
are
present
throughout
the
sip
there
is
a
definite
hop
spiciness
in
the
finish
that
bleeds
over
as
a
light
bitterness
in
the
dry
cinnamon
ginger
aftertaste
lightmedium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
thin
on
the
tongue
dry
with
a
spicy
prickle
i
have
an
almost
irrational
distaste
for
this
brewery
but
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
not
overly
spiced
has
an
appealing
sweetness
with
a
dry
finish
medium
bodied
crisp
carbonation
easy
drinking
nothing
at
all
offensive
here
except
perhaps
the
label
surprise
surprise
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
in
a
pumpkin
beer
slightly
hazy
orange
amber
color
spice
and
light
sugary
maltiness
tick
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
pumpkin
beer
malty
and
slightly
sweet
mixed
well
with
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
pielike
spices
definitely
worth
a
drink

looked
decent
and
didnt
smell
too
bad
but
completely
lacked
in
taste
and
feel
very
weak
and
watery
what
i
liked
the
color
was
great
the

were
not

the

was
great
what

didnt
like
the

was

watery
the
taste
was
not

enough
what
i
would
change
make
the

have
a

and
make
the

stand
out
a

be

12oz

a

there
was
just
a
touch
of
a
light
tan
head
that
didnt
last
long
or
leave
any

decent

some
pumpkin
and
pumpkin

the
taste
is
pretty
good
a
fairly
decent

some
pumpkin

and
pumpkin
somewhat
neutral

a

and
this
is
a
good
one
drinkable
enough
and
affordable
i
have
never
been
much
of
a
magic
hat
fan
poured
from
bottle
appearance
is
cloudy
orangeamber
aroma
is
full
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
nutmeg
cinnamon
clove
and
a
bubblegum
note
that
may
be
the
toasted
barley
flavors
match
the
aromas
with
some
pumpkin
flavor
on
top
of
the
spices
medium
body
overall
this
is
another
very
tasty
offering
from
harpoon
its
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
and
one
that
ill
get
again
next
autumn
v
good
value
8
bucks
a
six
pack
o
a
very
decent
pumpkin
ale
o
i
tried
but
either
pumpkin
beers
are
just
a
seasonal
novelty
to
make
cool
bottle
labels
or
pumpkins
were
just
not
meant
for
making
beer
i
will
continue
to
try
these
but
i
have
found
very
very
few
that
are
worth
a
damn
this
is
so
good
its
a
liquid
pumpkin
pie
and
thats
a
good
thing
much
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
i
will
get
this
again
next
year
if
your
a
pumpkin
fan
this
is
a
tasty
treat
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
be
a
straightforward
pumpkin
ale
but
as
the
ufo
name
might
indicate
it
seemed
more
like
a
pumpkin
alewheat
beer
hybrid
while
many
people
complain
about
pumpkin
ales
coming
out
earlier
and
earlier
in
the
season
this
beer
might
serve
as
a
nice
transition
into
autumn
o
a
best
pumpkin
beer
must
try
overall
this
beer
is
great
perfect
for
the
season
will
get
it
again
this
was
a
preety
decent
attempt
at
a
pumpkin
ale
good
not
great
easy
to
find
and
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
to
drink
i
would
enjoy
this
with
thanksgiving
diner
or
a
turkey
sandwich
but
not
too
much
of
the
cinnamon
flavor
looks
on
the
darker
side
of
ales
smell
has
a
pumpkin
aroma
altogether
a
great
pumpkin
ale
and
a
new
found
seasonal
favorite
o
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ive
had
worse
and
much
better
overall
i
was
rather
surprised
by
this
pumpkin
ale
its
a
medium
flavored
easy
drinking
pumpkin
beer
not
overly
sweet
or
spiced
while
i
prefer
a
more
aggressive
approach
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
for
those
looking
to
try
their
first
pumpkin
beer
not
the
best
pumpkin
beer
by
far
but
a
good
example
that
runs
spice
forward
and
shows
what
the
style
is
about
wish
there
was
more
pumpkin
and
less
spice
but
it
works
o
again
more
towards
the
bottom
of
the
pack
for
pumpkin
beers
very
nice
seasonal
offering
a
fantastic
seasonal
choice
the
light
spices
in
this
one
give
it
a
relaxed
fall
feel
and
make
it
a
nice
chill
on
the
patio
kind
of
brew
good
pumpkin
flavor
weird
after
taste
not
my
favorite
but
could
drink
a
bunch
with
out
complaining
pours
out
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
full
thick
head
smells
primarily
of
pie
spice
leaning
towards
cinnamon
flavor
is
pumpkin
and
pie
spice
forwarded
the
cinnamon
stands
out
above
all
else
like
dipping
your
finger
into
a
bowl
of
cinnamon
sugar
but
not
overly
sweet
mild
bitterness
balances
well
fluffy
mouthfeel
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
in
the
more
spice
forwarded
category
overall
a
real
good
pumpkin
beer
if
you
havent
had
it
give
it
a
try
cinnamon
after
taste
different
but
nice
not
a
bad
beer
but
forgettable
slight
smell
of
pumpkin
no
taste
of
pumpkin
but
some
after
taste
of
pumpkin
mouthfeel
was
nice

i
cant

a
buddy
gave
me
a
bottle
of
this
a
couple
weeks
ago
so
it
was
free
and
im
in
the
mood
for
a
pumpkin
beer
so
might
was
well
try
it

the

also
an

and
a
half
offwhite
head
with
good

along
with
a
decent
amount
of

aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
pumpkin

and

a
fresher

of
this
overall
a
very
good
pretty
clean
and
good
tasting
pumpkin

nice
to
see
the
flavors
hold
up
from
the

the
feel
is
bubbly
and
light
with
an
effervescent
and
lively

is

i
get
a

ive

would
happily

this

last
to

end
the

is

pumpkin

starts
with

just
a

pumpkin

o
im
not
much
of
a
pumpkin
ale
drinker
every
other
pumpkin
ale
ive
drank
has
always
been
thick
and
spicy
but
this
was
a
different
experience
and
actually
quite
enjoyable
i
would
describe
it
like
a
light
pumpkin
sponge
cake
kind
of
beer
enjoyed
this
one
outside
on
a
beautiful
and
sunny
fall
day
surrounded
by
swirling
fall
leaves
right
after
taking
the
family
pumpkin
picking
the
atmosphere
couldnt
have
been
better
the
beer
is
a
hazy
orange
amber
color
and
the
head
is
faint
and
small
the
spice
smell
is
heavy
on
cinnamon
and
a
touch
of
clove
some
malt
in
the
aroma
but
the
spice
is
serious
balanced
and
not
too
sweet
similar
flavor
to
the
smell
smooth
and
ful
body
satisfying
for
the
weather
nice
but
not
exceptional
aroma
of
pumpkin
spices
cinnamon
allspice
and
pumpkin
the
smell
is
fairly
strong
and
is
right
for
the
season
in
the
taste
pumpkin
with
sweet
and
vegetable
notes
pumpkin
pie
flavor
small
bitterness
and
coarse
leafy
hop
character
medium
bodied
feel
with
lingering
pumpkin
pie
flavor
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
pumpkin
ale
i
wont
drink
this
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
onward
overall
its
a
pretty
nice
pumpkin
spice
beer
id
imagine
that
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
despite
its
inherent
character
well
done
on
the
lighter
and
thinner
side
of
the
pumpkin
beer
spectrum
subtle
spicing
and
more
sweet
malts
ehhhh
middle
of
the
road
at
best
bought
a
six
pack
at
table
and
vine
appearance
has
a
nice
golden
amber
view
it
poured
a
medium
head
but
good
retention
aromas
were
definitely
festive
for
me
my
wife
could
smell
the
beer
from
a
mile
away
and
she
said
it
smelled
like
biscuits
extra
aromas
included
spices
like
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
of
course
the
pumpkin
smell
delicious
taste
with
a
mix
of
that
pumpkin
flavoring
with
malts
mouthfeel
had
a
decent
carbonation
with
a
slight
crispness
overall
a
really
good
festive
drink
overall
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
better
than
most
other
pumpkin
beers
price
point

bottle
o
let
me
say
that
i
do
not
like
pumpkin
ales
they
are
always
too
harsh
andor
cloying
and
spicy
for
me
however
this
beer
really
come
across
well
to
me
less
is
definitely
more
with
this
style
any
amount
of
pumpkin
spice
will
stand
out
compared
to
a
typical
beer
so
dont
overdo
it
pours
a
hazy
but
bright
orange
colour
with
a
limited
offwhite
head
that
disappears
quickly
earthy
aroma
of
spices
and
fruit
with
a
respectable
malt
backbone
the
flavour
has
a
real
depth
to
it
with
light
malts
complementing
the
gourd
elements
the
spices
are
not
overpowering
and
are
not
typical
pumpkin
pie
there
is
a
genuineness
in
here
that
is
both
surprising
and
delightful
glad
to
have
purchased
overall
interestingly
this
brew
was
completely
different
in
a
glass
as
opposed
to
right
out
of
the
bottle
in
the
bottle
the
drinkability
was
somewhat
lower
but
it
tasted
like
pumpkin
pie
which
was
pretty
cool
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
or
fruit
beers
in
general
but
this
brew
was
respectably
done
overall
a
very
nice
pumpkin
beer
the
hefeweizen
wasnt
a
style
that
i
thought
would
take
to
spices
well
but
this
one
does
quite
nicely
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
not
overspiced
overall
a
decent
pumpkin
brew
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
easy
drinking
and
a
bit
on
the
spicier
side
with
a
somewhat
lighter
pumpkin
flavor
overall
o
the
bottle
says
that
this
is
an
ale
brewed
with
pumpkin
and
spices
perhaps
they
just
took
their
regular
belgian
white
recipe
and
added
the
pumpkin
to
it
overall
a
very
light
bodied
pumpkin
update
on
9513
ive
had
several
of
these
this
year
after
picking
up
a
case
and
have
decided
this
is
the
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
of
2013
my
guests
from
california
agree
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
pumpkin
pie
im
surprised
the
reviews
saying
no
pumpkin
taste
i
disagree
and
also
now
wonder
if
the
ufo
can
is
somehow
that
much
better
than
the
bottle
overall
a
hometown
beer
for
me
and
it
lets
me
down
i
have
had
ufo
pumpkin
before
and
i
didnt
remember
it
being
this
low
quality
great
appearance
and
smell
but
the
taste
just
brings
it
down
the
mouthfeel
would
be
great
except
the
taste
brings
it
down
great
taste
i
enjoyed
every
drop
and
bought
some
to
take
home
now
back
in
australia
i
cant
find
anything
that
comes
close
i
have
tried
a
couple
of
other
pumpkin
beers
that
are
available
here
but
i
am
struggling
to
find
a
good
pumpkin
and
spice
beer
overall
pleasant
surprise
im
pretty
sure
that
it
was
an
expired
batch
and
it
was
still
good
so
needless
to
say
i
will
buy
some
of
this
years
batch
worth
a
try
o
overall
if
it
tasted
how
it
smelled
id
be
much
happier
but
it
didnt
so
of
course
im
not
very
happy
however
harpoon
does
have
a
history
of
making
good
beer
so
i
cant
be
all
that
upset
i
guess
one
bad
beer
doesnt
make
a
brewing
company
bad
it
might
just
have
been
a
bad
batch
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
darker
stronger
pumpkin
beers
from
the
likes
of
southern
tier
weyerbacher
and
dogfish
head
onot
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
i
was
afraid
it
would
taste
too
much
like
soda
because
harpoon
doesnt
usually
make
great
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
the
flavors
arent
too
pronounced
but
the
taste
achieves
a
nice
balance
between
spice
and
pumpkin
pretty
well
done
followed
the
instructions
on
the
bottle
to
pour
half
and
swirl
up
that
yeast
in
the
bottom
the
smell
was
nutmeg
and
spicy
poured
dark
and
with
a
1
head
the
mouthfeel
was
good
although
i
didnt
get
too
much
of
the
pumpkin
which
i
have
been
realizing
the
majority
of
the
pumpkin
brews
are
just
beers
that
have
a
heavy
spice
and
not
too
much
pumpkin
in
them
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
better
than
the
bluemoon
and
harvest
pumpkin

although

most
will

of

for
those
who
cant

this
will
serve
as
a
solid
substitute
oanother
surprise
of
the
tasting
after
having
a
good
bit
of
harpoon
beer
i
was
worried
about
this
one
but
it
ended
up
tasting
decent
after
warming
up
a
little
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
glad
i
was
able
to
find
it
when
i
was
in
new
england
im
going
to
rate
this
as
an
excellent
pumpkin
beer
better
i
think
than
dfhs
punkin
on
par
with
brooklyns
excellent
offering
overallpleasant
suprise
by
harpoon
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
considering
we
dont
get
many
pumpkin
beers
i
will
be
revisiting
taste
is
a
bit
drier
than
expected
with
powdery
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
carrying
the
day
kindy
of
dusty
tasting
and
the
sweet
pie
aspect
is
all
but
lost
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
pumpkin
feel
to
the
beer
and
the
spices
are
not
overdone
but
i
think
the
beer
falls
short
of
any
sort
of
wow
factor
im
glad
i
bought
a
sixer
but
dont
see
myself
going
back
for
more
this
season
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
hazy
burnt
orange
color
with
a
foamy
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
lacin
in
minimal
but
the
retention
is
holding
up
fairly
well
so
far
the
smell
is
a
little
spicy
it
almost
smells
a
little
sweet
too
it
doesnt
have
the
biggest
aroma
to
it
but
yet
it
does
have
enough
to
interest
me
the
taste
for
me
was
really
quite
good
in
my
opinion
i
liked
the
spicy
kick
that
each
sip
had
the
flavor
were
nicely
balanced
here
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
had
a
medium
body
good
carbonation
to
it
and
remained
smooth
overall
this
beer
to
me
was
a
really
nice
seasonal
brew
well
worth
the
price
and
i
would
gladly
drink
it
again
pours
a
hazy
amber
orange
with
a
thin
head
not
much
retention
but
did
have
some
laceing
aroma
is
of
pumpkin
and
spices
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
quite
a
bit
taste
is
mostly
pumpkin
some
spice
there
but
not
a
great
balance
very
geniric
not
one
of
my
favorites
a
much
better
beer
than
i
was
expecting
going
into
this
review
very
drinkable
at
a
surprising
5
9
abv
overall
i
guess
i
am
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
expecting
a
nice
bit
of
spice
to
balance
overall
pumpkin
flavors
without
the
spice
its
like
drinking
squash
in
a
blender
will
not
buy
again
pumpkin
beers
seem
to
be
split
into
two
camps
the
spice
bombs
and
the
highly
vegetal
harpoon
does
a
nice
job
of
reaching
across
party
lines
and
bringing
together
the
pie
spice
and
vegetal
pumpkin
good
stuff
drink
interesting
but
average
overall
relative
lightness
makes
it
an
easy
drink
but
the
bitterness
cuts
into
the
spices
and
other
interesting
flavors
a
bit
too
much
points
for
giving
me
nostalgia
of
gingerbread
houses
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
full
overall
a
tasty
fall
seasonal
but
i
would
prefer
a
little
bit
of
a
drier
pumpkin
beer
myself
this
one
is
just
a
touch
sweet
o
hate
to
mark
it
a
3
5
since
its
a
good
beer
but
the
feel
on
the
palate
makes
it
a
little
less
drinkable
than
others
but
i
enjoy
it
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
seems
like
it
could
use
stronger
flavors
of
pumpkin
and
spices
o
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
out
there
but
whats
there
is
decent
id
like
more
spices
in
the
taste
but
other
than
that
its
a
pretty
average
beer
for
the
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
good
first
attempt
at
a
pumpkin
from
harpoon
good
pumpkin
session
o
this
one
turned
out
to
surprise
me
i
honestly
wasnt
expecting
much
but
it
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
tried
so
far
this
year
the
pumpkin
pie
flavors
are
there
with
a
dry
wheat
malt
o
a
very
enjoyable
spicy
pumpkin
ale
picked
up
a
bottle
at
abes
cold
beer
out
of
curiosity
id
prefer
the
alcohol
were
lower
but
otherwise
its
an
easytodrink
american
wheatpumpkin
hybrid
it
pairs
clean
pale
wheat
and
barley
with
a
mild
and
more
importantly
balanced
mix
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
its
sort
of
a
subtle
beer
and
some
might
find
it
watery
but
id
have
another
i
could
take
or
leave
pumpkin
beers
more
so
with
beer
with
pumpkin
in
them
but
this
one
is
just
right
it
has
a
good
malt
backbone
and
spices
which
are
balanced
perfectly
my
local
store
keeps
running
out
of
this
ufo
pumpkin
afer
2
trys
i
finally
scored
a
6er
i
love
pumpkin
ales
so
i
was
really
excite
to
try
this
one
when
i
first
poured
this
ale
i
noticed
how
cloudy
it
is
it
says
unfiltered
on
the
label
and
it
looks
unfiltered
the
colo
is
a
nice
golden
brown
it
reminds
me
of
baked
goods
the
smell
is
full
of
holidaypumpkin
spices
the
taste
is
a
unique
blend
of
malt
cinnamon
allspice
pumpkin
spice
and
maybe
some
ginger
all
in
all
this
is
why
i
love
the
pumpkin
ales
all
the
spices
mix
so
well
with
beer
this
is
a
pretty
nice
little
pumpkin
ale
and
it
has
my
pallet
ready
for
more
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
orange
with
a
decent
foamy
white
head
with
good
retention
the
smell
is
good
full
of
pumpkin
and
spice
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
with
good
carbonation
the
taste
is
a
little
disappointing
though
pretty
bitter
and
dry
i
get
a
little
pumpkin
and
spice
but
its
nothing
like
it
smells
overall
okay
but
not
up
to
the
smells
standard
pours
a
two
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
hazy
amberorange
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
spicy
pumpkin
nose
flavor
is
spice
and
tart
pumpkin
dry

overall
a
pretty
pleasant
brew
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
heavier
pumpkin
beers
you
find
this
time
of
year
olooks
and
smells
got
me
excited
but
this
was
a
let
down
the
taste
made
me
think
of
what
might
happen
if
a
macro
decided
to
brew
a
pumpkin
ale
overall
its
still
a
drinkable
beer
that
isnt
completely
terrible
however
the
pumpkin
beer
markest
is
large
and
this
example
wont
make
a
dent
this
is
mostly
unoffensive
although
there
are
some
strange
malt
flavors
the
spices
are
decent
and
the
use
of
actual
pumpkin
is
a
plus
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
but
id
drink
it
again
little
disappointing
it
is
more
of
the
usual
straight
up
pumpkin
pie
flavor
with
a
noticeable
wheat
beer
finish
the
mout
overall
dont
let
this
warm
up
cold
its
an
easy
drinking
take
on
the
pumpkin
ale
with
only
a
few
off
flavors
but
once
it
warms
it
falls
apart
and
turns
in
to
a
discordant
mess
decent
overall
not
bad
i
was
expecting
worse
but
the
malts
werent
bad
light
hops
are
nice
the
pumpkin
or
spices
werent
overpowering
but
let
you
know
it
was
there
started
promising
but
ended
disappointing
those
that
like
the
overly
spiced
pumpkin
beers
shipyard
anyone
may
like
this
as
it
adds
a
touch
of
real
pumpkin
to
it
but
i
dont
overly
enjoy
it
i
may
recommend
it
to
some
gateway
beer
lovers
though
i
love
the
fall
because
that
means
pumpkin
beer
i
really
enjoy
shipyard
pumpkin
and
have
a
soft
spot
for
harvest
moon
when
i
tasted
harpoons
ufo
pumpkin
it
blew
my
mind
it
was
the
first
time
it
really
tasted
like
liquid
pumpkin
pie
although
its
still
well
before
fall
it
gives
me
that
feeling
every
time
i
enjoy
one
looking
forward
to
having
it
with
cold

it

with
a
bit
of

the
aroma
has
a
nice
combination
of
pumpkin
nutmeg
and
other
spices
with
a
whiff
of
hops
at
the
end
the
body
was
thinner
than
i
might
have
hoped
the
taste
had
enough
pumpkin
flavor
so
that
it
lives
up
to
its
name
but
it
was
nothing
that
was
out
of
the
ordinary
it
finished
clean
and
crisp
but
all
told
it
was
really
fairly
routine
i
would
drink
this
one
again
well
done
well
its
a
pumpkin
ale
and
it
seems
well
done
this
style
is
usually

wannabes

i

pumpkin
ufo
captures
the
essence
of
it
well
in
a
drinkable
form
interesting
and
certainly
has
the
autumn
pumpkin
feel
along
with
another
tart
fruit
hint
it
is
kind
of
like
pumpkin
fruit
soda
the
balance
of
flavor
is
lost
with
time
and
knocks
this
one
down
a
level
as
it
didnt
start
off
too
badly
i
was
excited
to
get
in
the
fall
spirit
and
try
a
newly
released
pumpkin
beer
i
should
of
had
my
iphone
on
me
but
i
made
snap
judgement
this
beer
has
an
ok
aroma
the
apearance
is
the
best
part
about
the
beer
the
taste
is
bland
pumpkin
on
the
finish
it
was
hard
to
detect
any
spices
if
i
did
they
were
barely
used
in
this
beer
over
all
a
very
very
bland
pumpkin
beer
my
bartender
summed
it
up
by
saying
it
tastes
like
budweiser
mixed
with
pumpkin
i
wouldnt
go
that
far
but
it
wasnt
good
give
it
a
shot
all
i
know
is
this
one
is
not
for
me
harpoon
is
not
a
bad
brewery
they
just
need
to
tweak
the
next
batch
perhaps
had
fresh
on
tap
at
the
burren
it
was
really
fing
good
awesome
aroma
get
it
on
draft
orangered
pretty
much
burnt
pumpkin
small
amount
of
head
with
a
thick
ring
around
the
glass
afterwards
only
an
extremely
small
amount
of
haze

o
pumpkin
nose

spicy
nutmeg
pumpkin
and
sourdough
light
body
with
a
crisp
tingle
on
the
tongue
light
bready
malt
body
with
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
spices
finish
is
almost
nothing
watery
a
bland
dryness
and
only
a
carbonation
tingle
it
sounds
boring
but
this
is
a
fabulous
beer
a
perfect
session
pumpkin
not
over
the
top
not
that
mild
just
right
to
drink
a
case
or
two
make
a
100barrel
pumpkin
beer
guys
this
ones
not
up
to
snuff
kind
of
a
harsh
grade
but
theres
no
way
this
is
above
average
in
the
spectrum
of
pumpkin
beers
pours
a
hazy
deep
orange
amber
with
a
slight
off
white
head
doesnt
stick
around
long
and
almost
no
lacing
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
flavor
begins
with
a
nice
touch
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
cinnamon
leading
the
way
also
some
nutmeg
nice
job
not
overpowering
the
pumpkin
finish
pumpkin
pie
filling
finish
which
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
touch
of
hops
in
the
beer
solid
drinkable
pumpkin
offering
from
harpoon
which
still
maintains
the
characteristics
of
a
beer
a
lighter
pumpkin
offering
for
those
of
you
who
arent
looking
to
be
overpowered
by
spice
and
heartiness
if
you
like
the
style
check
it
out
nothing
eye
popping
but
definitely
a
solid
addition
to
the
ufoharpoon
lineup
if
youre
really
interested
in
trying
some
real
pumpkin
beers
id
recommend
southern
tiers
pumking
dogfish
punkin
ale
weyerbacher
imperial
pumpkin
ale
and
shipyards
smashed
pumpkin
let
me
know
how
it
goes
od
its
a
solid
harpoon
addition
good
for
summer
right
now
i
can
see
it
being
very
enjoyable
in
the
fall
its
an
easy
drinker
but
with
all
the
other
pumpkin
beers
out
there
i
dont
see
myself
picking
much
of
this
up
high
b
this
is
an
old
one
bottled
in
2013
didnt
quite
foam
over
when
i
opened
the
bottle
but
about
1
inch
of
foam
stuck
straight
up
above
the
bottle
rim
poured
with
a
big
white
thick
head
sour
spice
aroma
is
this
beer
supposed
to
be
sour
tart
mildly
spiced
taste
not
getting
much
pumpkin
i
think
it
tastes
pretty
good
nice
bubbly
dry
mouthfeel
i
really
like
it
hope
its
supposed
to
taste
this
way
not
my
normal
style
served
in
a
8
oz
snifter
at
white
oak
tavern
cloudy
orange
citrus
like
nose
sour
but
not
overly
but
blends
with
the
pumpkin
very
well
smooth
but
nicely
carbonated
i
must
say
i
was
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
liked
the
fall
spices
which
they
incorporated
into
the
beer
but
overall
the
beer
seemed
way
less
flavorful
than
their
other
beers
and
the
tartness
was
way
toneddown
and
i
would
have
little
some
pumpkin
taste
as
well
sampled
on
tap
at
the
black
star
coop
jp
tap
takeover
pours
a
nice
bright
tangerine
color
with
just
a
ski
of
fine
white
head
only
clear
at
the
edges
nose
is
surprisingly
underwhelming
with
just
a
hint
of
orange
flavor
autumn
in
a
glass
apple
squash
orange
and
wood
this
sour
would
serve
as
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
newbie
sour

finish

very
clean
light
sour

earthy

very

cinnamon
white

typical
jolly

offering
the
spicing
adds
a
really
nice
flavor
to
the
usual
sourness
but
theres
not
really
much
pumpkin
coming
through
a
very
good
beer
well
worth
trying
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
one
finger
thick
dense

a
few
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
lactic
with
straw

bread
aromas
unripe
nectarine
coriander
gingerish
but
maybe
thats
just
a
component
of
the
raw
pumpkin
not
canned
junk
so
dont
expect
a
pumpkin
pie
in
your
face
not
getting
any
cocoa
if
youre
not
going
to
give
me
an
intense
and
accurate
beersentation
of
pumpkin
pie
then
this
is
what
i
want
taste
brings
the
same
plus
a
pop
of
nutmegish

bottled

much
needed
different
take
on
the
style
not
that
its
a
new
release
given
the
trend
towards
bigger
sweeter
barrelier
was
not
that
sour
the
pumpkin
flavor
was
not
as
strong
as
it
could
have
been
and
at
the
same
time
there
was
not
much
in
the
way
of
spices
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
jp
beer
but
strictly
as
a
pumpkin
ale
it
falls
shorts
since
the
pumpkin
and
the
spices
arent
all
that
noticeable
but
in
the
end
i
still
enjoyed
it
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
not
too
acidic
crisp
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
dont
think
i
would
have
a
problem
drinking
the
whole
bottle
since
its
not
too
acidic
and
theres
isnt
any
aspect
that
was
too
overpowering
and
would
wear
on
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
mouthfeel
it
was
pretty
good
and
it
fit
in
nicely
with
this
beer
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
spices
and
pumpkin
didnt
show
up
more
i
can
get
a
little
bit
of
them
but
i
found
myself
wish
that
both
aspects
were
much
stronger
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
its
not
something
im
going
to
stock
up
on
but
ill
for
sure
get
one
when
its
released
next
year
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
farmhouse
ale
fan
if
your
looking
for
a
good
pumpkin
ale
im
pretty
sure
you
will
be
disappointed
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
i
think
the
balance
was
a
little
off
and
in
the
end
i
just
wanted
more
of
those
pumpkin
and
spice
aspects
its
not
my
favorite
jp
beer
or
my
favorite
of
the
style
it
kind
of
falls
in
the
middle
in
both
categories
nice
job
guys
this
beer
wasnt
bad
at
all
keep
up
the
hard
work
on
tap
at
the
community
tap
in
greenville
this
is
a
good
sour
but
the
pumpkin
is
lacking
it
was
still
good
though
for
a
sour
it
had
great
balance
not
to
overpower
the
pallet
if
they
kicked
up
a
bit
on
the
pumpkin
this
would
be
beyond
good
as
it
is
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
try
again
great
pumpkin
sour
not
too
strong
so
fantastically
drinkable
and
delicious
great
mouthfeel
and
overall
very
tasty
put
your
nose
in
the
glass
and
its
pretty
much
all
brett
though
theres
a
spicy
clove
and
pepper
accompaniment
and
once
it
hits
your
lips
thats
exactly
what
you
taste
upfront
that
is
briny
barnyard
funk
strikes
hard
on
the
palate
providing
a
crisp
first
impression
let
that
initial
shock
wash
over
you
and
what
you
find
underneath
is
a
solid
allspice
and
butternut
flavor
peppered
with
light
ginger
notes
the
fall
flavor
isnt
subtle
either
its
balanced
sure
but
its
there
in
force
as
is
the
funk
in
fact
everything
about
this
beer
is
bold
the
scent
the
spice
the
pumpkin
backbone
even
the
mouthfeel
is
big
and
bright
all
in
all
it
turns
out
great
its
rare
that
you
find
a
beer
that
could
pair
equally
well
with
both
thanksgiving
dinner
and
a
big
stinky
slice
of
gorgonzola
but
once
you
do
as
youd
imagine
its
quite
a
memorable
experience
a
gorgeous
beer
cheers
very
good
sour
but
very
minimal
pumpkin
cacao
or
spice
taste
not
getting
a
ton
of
pumpkin
or
cacao
but
a
damn
fine
beer
giving
it
a
5
deduction
for
not
screaming
pumpkin
to
me
but
miles
better
than
most
of
this
ilk
super
refreshing
seems
more
like
a
summer
beer

maybe
just

typical
jp
sour
and
tart
notes
with
a
little
bit
of
a
cinnamon
hint
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
very
enjoyable
as
i
was
expecting
based
on
this
brewer
past
effort
but
i
can
barely
taste
all
the
spices
mentioned
on
the
label
o
i
have
been
looking
forwar
to
this
baby
for
a
while
being
a
jp
whore
but
this
kinda
let
me
down
still
worth
trying
if
you
get
a
chance
to
snatch
this
puppy
up
but
keep
your
hopes
within
reach
the
spice
and
sourness
is
there
and
i
like
it
but
body
is
lacking
regardless
i
am
enjoying
this
hard
to
find
brew
and
is
gettig
better
as
it
warms
this
beer
is
terrible
the
brewed
date
was
september
2012
so
maybe
it
was
skunked
but
i
got
it
form
a
reputable
beer
store
so
i
assumed
its
still
good
the
smell
taste
and
feel
are
nothing
like
a
pumpkin
beer
and
something
ill
pass
on
in
the
future
o
my
first
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
this
was
quite
complex
had
a
great
nose
and
was
quite
drinkable
looking
forward
to
more
of
their
brews
overall
this
is
balanced
to
the
very
dry
and
sour
side
not
much
spice
here
but
that
may
have
faded
in
three
years
since
it
was
brewed
the
sourness
likely
has
increased
over
time
as
well
this
tastes
more
like
a
gueuze
from
brussels
o
an
unexpected
smell
and
flavour
on
a
pumpkin
brew
with
the
introduction
of
bretta
a
light
and
crisp
experience
that
livens
the
palette
granted
its
possible
our
bottle
at
3
yrs
old
may
have
a
more
pronounced
bretta
profile
and
weaker
spice
notes
this
brew
is
a
new
and
creative
offering
for
a
pumpkin
brew
good
for
those
of
us
who
appreciate
a
sour
this
is
my
kinda
pumpkin
ale
sour
dry
funky
and
spicy
the
sour
dominates
with
the
pumpkin
and
spices
lingering
in
the
background
and
finally
rounds
out
the
finish
with
a
crisp
and
snappy
tartness
awesome
overall
over
half
was
drain
poured
and
the
other
half
turned
into
a
beer
cheese
sauce
o
an
ok
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
once
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
style
though
the
pumpkin
and
the
sour
just
dont
seem
to
blend
well
in
my
opinoin
it
needs
a
little
more
pumpkin
spices
and
sweetness
i
probably
wont
be
getting
this
beer
again
poured
into
a
standard
tap
a
hazed
brown
infused
orange
with
a
thinner
off
white
head
atopkind
of
a
strange
color
to
this
funky
cheese
aromas
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
pie
spicean
odd
combination
but
sorta
worked
flavors
of
barnyard
funk
and
more
of
the
cheese
wich
isnt
my
thinga
faint
pie
spice
comes
into
play
i
knew
it
would
be
a
little
funky
coming
from
jp
but
maybe
a
little
to
much
of
it
for
me
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
a
steady
medium
level
of
carbonation
its
clean
with
a
strong
crispness
that
keeps
biting
though
its
got
a
good
flow
to
it
as
well
its
pretty
dry
all
the
way
through
and
into
a
finish
with
a
gently
lingering
tartness
this
one
was
checking
all
the
right
boxes
presentation
aroma
mouthfeel
all
fantastic
there
is
even
a
lot
to
like
in
the
taste
its
downfall
is
its
overpowering
sweetness
and
puckering
tartness
they
ruin
the
experience
i
really
wanted
to
enjoy
this
beer
but
even
as
sipped
the
last
few
ounces
of
the
750ml
bottle
i
was
caught
offguard
by
its
tartness
if
you
enjoy
sucking
on
lemons
this
is
the
beer
for
you
just
dont
go
expecting
too
much
pumpkin
overall
i
still
dont
know
how
to
feel
about
the
beer
it
is
a
sour
pumpkin
ale
its
a
bit
hard
to
grasp
even
though
it
is
tasty
but
even
for
the
unusual
take
i
would
have
wanted
a
bit
more
pumpkin
and
a
bit
more
robustness
on
the
side
of
it
being
a
sour
ale
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
if
no
one
told
me
it
had
pumpkin
i
would
have
a
hard
time
knowing
though
i
have
mixed
feelings
d
great
pumpkin
ale
good
balance
of
complexity
and
spices
a
good
brett
beer
but
not
really
a
great
pumpkin
ale
just
slight
nuances
of
pumpkin
and
spice
this
has
changed
much
with
age
as
i
remember
it
being
relatively
the
same
fresh
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
especially
given
the
higher
price
tag
but
i
still
look
forward
to
jp
beers
i
have
yet
to
try
overall
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
pumpkin
and
spice
level
was
low
which
was
nice
o
complex
and
outstanding
pumpkin
brew
not
for
everyone
because
of
the
sour
funk
but
it
sour
beers
are
your
thing
you
will
want
to
try
this
one
the
6
0
abv
is
right
on
to
not
take
away
from
the
enjoyment
of
this
one
either
oi
am
a
little
let
down
here
but
i
suspect
that
my
bottle
might
be
past
its
prime
the
pumpkin
and
spices
are
very
subtle
and
the
wet
earth
flavors
need
a
little
more
tartness
to
balance
out
the
earthy
stoney
taste
that
dominated
this
brew
that
being
said
this
is
a
great
looking
beer
that
i
will
try
again
if
i
can
get
a
fresh
one
taste
is
definite
spice
almost
chai
flavor
with
a
bit
of
nutty
malt
undertones
funky
tart
spice
follows
with
a
kick
really
a
complex
beer
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
here
and
overall
pretty
tasty
nice
funk
characteristics
but
finishes
with
a
heavier
malty
body
nice
brew
o
there
is
enough
funkinesssourness
to
this
beer
that
it
is
one
that
you
will
want
to
sip
over
an
hour
of
so
but
it
is
a
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
brew
i
like
the
funkiness
but
the
pumpkin
is
very
subtle
in
this
one
o
overall
a
natural
pumpkin
puree
drink
spicing
is
balanced
just
right
and
kept
in
check
while
there
is
a
unique
sourness
thrown
in
for
good
measure
number
1
pumpkin
may
be
a
stretch
but
if
your
a
fan
of
jolly
pumpkin
then
give
it
a
go
for
a
unique
ride
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
hints
of
brown
and
yellow
very
inviting
color
thick
head
at
por
disappates
to
a
good
film
on
top
of
the
beer
fine
creamy
carbonation
smells
typical
sour
nice
but
difficult
to
discern
other
aromas
flavor
is
excellent
subtle
pumpkin
and
spices
up
front
followed
by
a
strong
sour
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
i
picked
this
brew
up
with
my
wife
at
a
great
beer
store
while
on
a
little
outing
the
beer
pours
a
muted
gold
color
from
a
large
bottle
fairly
nonexistent
head
the
aroma
is
belgian
yeast
and
spice
some
funk
and
some
fruit
not
much
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
but
a
defined
vegetal
character
the
taste
is
very
balanced
i
like
the
slight
acidity
it
adds
some
dimension
to
the
brew
the
body
is
medium
in
heft
and
the
brew
is
very
drinkable
recommended
but
not
at
15750ml
its
a
unique
pumpkin
ale
not
all
spice
or
over
the
top
not
sugary
and
very
enjoyable
this
would
be
a
great
brew
for
halloween
in
a
tropical
climate
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
medium
to
mediumhigh
level
carbonation
that
foams
the
beer
somewhat
substantially
across
the
palate
creating
a
mouthfeel
that
is
at
first
fizzy
then
smooth
and
foamy
for
the
remaining
amount
of
time
this
lingers
on
the
palate
closes
semidry
with
little
bitterness
and
slight
stickiness
across
the
palate
o
this
beer
was
a
lot
better
than
i
expected
one
of
the
more
sour
jolly
pumpkins
ive
tried
but
is
also
a
great
example
of
a
pumpkin
beer
the
fruit
is
there
as
well
as
the
spice
but
are
complemented
by
a
dry
tart
finish
that
makes
this
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
beers
on
the
market
awesome
overall
the
pumpkin
character
was
pretty
subtle
definitely
more
of
a
farmhouse
than
a
pumpkin
ale
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
scores
so
highly
because
of
it
being
a
pumpkin
ale
as
a
wild
ale
its
only
above
average
still
this
is
the
way
i
wish
most
all
pumpkin
ales
would
be
refreshing
and
quaffable
because
of
the
acidity
and
dryness
instead
of
a
spicy
slog
to
get
through
hazy
orange
under
a
frothy
white
head
smells
of
fresh
pumpkin
flesh
funk
tart
fruit
lemon
and
mellow
spices
mmmm
autumn
in
a
bottle
for
me
tart
mildly
spiced
cider
and
balancing
malt
flavors
a
nice
wellconstructed
blend
of
flavors
smooth
lightly
sour
dry
with
a
slightly
chalky
texture
a
very
satisfying
and
drinkable
funky
pumpkin
ale
i
like
it
this
pours
a
ruddy
toasted
goldenstraw
with
light
foaming
theres
an
aroma
which
is
initially
offputting
as
it
is
unexpected
and
unlike
anything
i
would
think
of
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
alas
this
is
no
mere
pumpkin
ale
the
aroma
is
tart
slightly
sour
with
some
vegetal
notes
that
develop
as
it
warms
its
lightly
bodied
with
a
flavor
that
has
slight
hints
of
pumpkin
and
pumpkin
spices
with
some
light
clove
nutmeg
and
allspice
nuances
that
dance
around
the
palate
gently
carbonated
it
doesnt
feel
heavy
and
it
finishes
dry
initially
i
thought
it
infected
slightly
but
once
the
chill
goes
away
and
the
aromas
and
flavors
come
into
greater
balance
i
realized
its
the
magical
mystery
of
yeast
barrelaging
and
the
brew
itself
coming
together
as
i
spent
time
with
this
brew
i
grew
to
appreciate
and
enjoy
it
immensely
o
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
not
a
traditional
pumpkin
crusher
and
i
really
enjoy
jolly
pumpkins
interpretation
of
this
usually
hitormiss
style
they
nailed
this
one
with
a
nice
twist
of
funk
oi
wasnt
expecting
to
get
blown
away
but
this
is
an
amazing
example
of
an
outside
the
box
sour
does
everything
just
right
the
balance
and
flavors
are
downright
perfect
neither
one
outshines
the
other
and
i
felt
like
i
was
getting
just
enough
of
each
flavor
every
time
i
took
a
sip
for
the
pumpkin
and
sour
beer
lover
pick
this
one
up
you
wont
be
disappointed
with
a
great
barrelbeer
i
tend
to
forget
the
base
the
malt
bill
and
hop
order
this
beer
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
light
but
lingering
bitter
finish
i
appreciate
the
lower
abv
and
think
more
alcohol
would
have
made
this
too
sharp
la
parcela
has
great
malic
sourness
orange
pithiness
marigold
leaf
restraint
plus
highly
evolved
wood
equals
a
pinnacle
of
refreshment
this
could
have
come
from
a
belgian
valley
fantastic
superb
highly
evolved
drink
well
i
was
thinking
this
would
be
a
bit
more
layered
a
bit
onesided
but
thats
okay
its
a
sour
pumpkin
beer
thats
a
year
old
i
would
love
a
fresher
bottle
but
i
think
even
with
decay
to
pumpkin
a
nice
sour
came
out
rating
to
how
i
liked
it
vs
style
on
this
one
edit
its
been
a
while
since
ive
written
this
review
so
after
having
it
again
i
have
to
up
the
rating
slightly
its
such
a
nice
refreshing
break
from
the
overly
spiced
pumpkin
beers
taste
is
so
pleasant
and
is
easily
drinkable
d
not
the
home
run
ive
come
to
expect
from
jolly
pumpkin
i
would
have
liked
to
have
tasted
this
beer
a
little
younger
and
closer
to
its
source
and
while
its
a
welcome
departure
from
many
other
pumpkin
ales
it
seems
a
little
more
befitting
of
the
spring
or
best
an
indian
summer
rather
than
the
fall
still
a
quite
good
beer
a
sour
pumpkin
beer
it
was
only
a
matter
of
it
i
opened
this
with
much
excitement
it
poures
a
hazy
pale
orange
color
with
a
one
inch
head
made
of
tiny
white
bubbles
it
lasts
quite
awhile
too
the
nose
is
very
strange
sour
and
acidic
like
lacto
at
first
then
a
smooth
sweet
vibe
from
the
cacao
and
finally
tart
pumpkins
almost
composty
if
you
didnt
know
what
sour
beer
was
its
taste
is
also
very
different
theres
a
bit
more
spice
cinnamon
for
sure
and
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
more
pronounced
than
in
the
smell
smooth
feel
again
i
think
from
the
addition
of
cacao
which
is
an
interesting
additive
in
a
beer
there
is
a
little
vinegar
taste
in
the
finish
but
it
matches
up
well
with
the
sweet
component
great
carbonation
and
enough
body
for
a
fall
beer
ive
definitely
never
had
anything
like
this
and
it
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
through
it
definitely
search
this
out
if
you
dig
pumpkin
ales
o
great
beer
all
around
and
a
wonderful
take
on
the
pumpkin
beer
style
this
really
mixes
it
up
in
this
season
of
pumpkin
beers
with
all
spice
and
cinnamon
o
i
really
liked
this
for
the
price
ill
never
get
it
again
but
i
was
glad
to
try
it
this
once
cheers
oa
very
complex
beer
that
is
nicely
sour
actually
i
bet
if
i
gave
this
to
someone
and
had
them
taste
it
i
bet
they
wouldnt
realize
its
a
pumpkin
beer
it
could
have
a
bit
more
robustness
to
it
but
itd
be
difficult
to
make
a
better
pumpkin
sour
o
overall
i
have
dove
headfirst
into
the
sour
trend
and
therefore
really
liked
this
one
hints
if
pumpkin
made
me
even
happier
but
you
simply
cant
go
into
this
one
thinking
youre
drinking
a
pumpkin
beer
was
pretty
excited
to
try
but
excitement
ended
rather
quickly
nice
color
and
smell
but
could
taste
hardly
any
pumpkin
very
sour
and
bitter
after
taste
expected
better
from
jolly
pumpkin
especially
at
an
11
99
price
tag
out
of
all
the
pumpkin
beers
i
have
had
this
year
this
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
i
bought
the
750
ml
bottle
here
last
sunday
the
ale
was
bottle
on
9142011
the
ale
had
a
nice
aromatic
smell
and
the
color
i
expected
the
taste
however
i
did
not
find
appeasing
it
tasted
more
cider
like
rather
than
an
ale
to
be
truthful
it
was
very
sour
not
what
youd
expect
from
a
pumpkin
ale
so
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
sours
i
would
not
recommend
overy
interesting
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
im
a
big
fan
of
sours
so
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
could
see
where
some
people
may
have
wanted
a
bit
more
pumpkin
characteristic
to
it
likely
the
best
pumpkin
beer
that
ive
had
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
them
but
its
jolly
pumpkin
and
im
not
all
too
surprised
that
i
enjoyed
it
the
beer
being
a
year
old
added
some
complexity
and
the
funk
notes
really
came
out
more
overy
disappointing
on
almost
all
fronts
the
very
essence
of
pumpkin
is
often
misconstrued
as
a
sweet
and
sugary
taste
which
often
eliminates
the
more
earthly
elements
of
the
fruit
to
me
la
parcela
takes
that
misconception
and
puts
it
on
steroids
i
will
not
be
purchasing
this
again
fairly
simple
it
gives
you
a
good
tartness
but
not
much
else
fades
quickly
and
bitter
will
do
as
a
fix
but
would
not
seek
it
out
again
looks
decent
smells
tart
but
there
is
simply
no
complexity
no
malt
sweetness
and
a
mildly
unpleasant
bitter
finish
overall
a
nice
beer
but
a
bit
of
a
dissapointment
i
was
really
hoping
for
some
pumpkin
flavor
but
the
sourness
of
this
beer
really
dominates
there
is
a
bitterness
at
the
end
that
seems
to
not
compliment
the
other
flavor
notes
ive
had
better
from
jp
overall
gawd
i
love
some
jolly
pumpkin
as
with
all
of
their
ales
they
never
disappoint
glad
to
have
tried
a
jolly
pumpkin
with
actual
pumpkin
in
it
must
try
o
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
pumpkin
berliner
weisse
which
is
something
i
dont
think
ive
ever
seen
before
definitely
going
to
buy
this
more

overall
this
is
a
fine
sour
it
has
fall
written
all
over
it
despite
a
lack
of
pumpkin
influence
i
say
this
is
really
an
american
wild

the

actually
worked
with
the
apple

to
create
an
authentic

beer
well
done

overall
it
was

the

was

to
be
there
good

brew
just
dont

to

i
like
sours
so
this
is
good
i
should
have
drank
it
sooner

its
pretty

is

a

beer
without
feeling
like
youre
drinking
liquid
pumpkin
pie
highly
recommend
for
the
fall
and
winter
holidays
after
sampling
this
again
its
definitely
closer
to
a
wild
ale
than
a
pumpkin
which
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
a
jolly
pumpkin
brew
a
nice
changeup
to
the
normally
rich
and
weighty
holiday
ales
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
but
because
i
love
sours
it
doesnt
work
that
well
within
the
pumpkin
ale
style
parameters
but
i
guess
thats
its
strengthit
pushes
boundaries
i
think
i
just
went
into
this
one
with
the
totally
wrong
expectation
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
pumpkin
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
but
this
is
probably
pretty
close
to
what
i
should
have
imaginedmore
of
a
pumpkin
lambic
than
a
pumpkin
ale
the
rustic
earthy
yeasty
funk
flavors
actually
serve
as
a
nice
foil
to
the
pumpkin
flavors
and
the
light
spicing
i
was
slightly
disappointed
that
the
cacao
didnt
really
come
through
but
keeping
it
in
mind
as
a
pumpkin
wild
ale
it
was
actually
pretty
good
the
powdery
dry
character
and
highly
phenolic
taste
of
jolly
pumpkin
ales
give
them
their
house
character
but
this
slightly
maltier
or
starchier
example
balances
as
well
as
any
in
their
arsinal
pours
a
clear
light
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
foamy
chunks
and
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
biscuitlike
malt
spices
and
some
fruity
aromas
taste
is
of
biscuitlike
malt
spices
and
some
fruity
pumpkin
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
ale
that
is
much
different
from
others
i
have
tried
in
the
past
this
beer
is
not
really
that
funkysour
like
other
jolly
pumpkin
beers
but
i
still
am
impressed
with
this
one
overall
impression
very
complexed
but
can
i
rate
this
as
a
pumpkin
i
will
give
it
a
decent
grade
all
around
but
almost
shows
more
signs
of
being
a
lambic
or
gueuze
rather
than
a
pumpkin
ale
ive
heard
many
people
raving
about
this
so
went
for
it
if
you
get
a
chance
i
would
go
for
it
but
only
if
your
a
fan
of
sour
brews
overall
pretty
tasty
sour
with
a
pumpkin
kick
o
the
nice
light
tart
beer
has
good
depth
and
a
gentle
funk
to
it
none
of
the
pumpkin
spice
or
cacao
stood
out
but
it
did
have
lots
of
subtle
layers
that
these
probably
contributed
too
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
with
some
nice
drinkable
feel
that
has
some
interesting
flavor
and
some
interesting
crispness
that
is
almost
like
a
larger
if
it
were
a
little
bigger
this
ends
up
being
quite
an
amazing
beer
and
not
just
another
pumpkin
beer
this
is
something
that
is
really
different
from
the
pack
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
seems
misplaced
as
a
pumpkin
ale
because
so
little
pumpkin
flavor
comes
through
it
is
very
tasty
though
i
had
a
difficult
time
finishing
it
this
beer
pours
a
nice
hazy
orange
amber
color
there
is
a
nice
finger
of
white
head
resting
on
top
the
head
has
good
retention
and
it
leaves
some
scattered
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
has
some
tartness
to
it
and
some
light
fall
spice
aromas
there
is
a
little
bit
of
funk
here
as
well
as
some
light
fruits
and
a
little
bit
of
pumpkin
the
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
well
it
starts
off
with
some
nice
tart
fruitiness
and
a
mild
amount
of
fall
spices
the
pumpkin
is
here
but
it
is
definitely
on
the
subtle
side
there
is
some
funk
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
too
the
finish
leaves
some
lingering
spice
and
fruit
flavor
behind
on
the
palate
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
funk
this
has
a
medium
body
and
pretty
good
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
nice
smooth
feel
to
it
there
is
a
bit
of
a
tingly
feel
from
the
spices
and
a
bit
of
funk
this
has
good
drinkability
it
has
nice
flavor
and
goes
down
well
i
could
easily
have
a
few
glasses
of
this
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
think
it
is
too
light
on
the
fall
spices
and
pumpkin
flavor
it
just
doesnt
really
feel
too
much
like
a
season
beer
to
me
it
is
good
and
worth
trying
out
though
cheers
overall
a
delightful
sour
beer
not
overly
sour
just
tart
enough
to
make
your
mouth
pucker
i
dont
get
any
pumpkin
and
the
cacoa
and
spices
are
very
subtle
drinkability
is
high
well
done
o
thank
god
jolly
pumpkin
decided
to
try
a
different
take
on
the
pumpkin
ale
other
than
a
few
imperial
pumpkin
ales
that
used
different
bases
for
theirs
the
style
has
become
pretty
mundane
now
here
comes
a
sour
pumpkin
genius
very
easy
drinking
and
would
make
an
excellent
introduction
to
those
trying
to
get
into
sours
all
around
and
excellent
sour
although
mild
with
hints
of
an
actual
pumpkin
flavor
along
with
cherry
and
apple
overall
a
really
nice
and
complex
sour
jolly
pumpkin
beers
never
cease
to
amaze
me
the
balance
and
funk
of
this
beer
is
really
nice
really
easy
to
drink
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
again
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
the
sourness
but
it
was
pleasent
not
too
strong
or
overwhelming
by
any
means
definitely
a
diferent
type
of
pumpkin
beer
cheers
brew
pours
a
dirty
and
dull
yellow
golden
color
under
a
creamy
head
a
great
lacing
ensues
nose
carries
a
mild
and
brisk
sweet
herbal
citrus
aroma
mouthfeel
is
of
pleasantly
sour
not
too
tart
citrus
rind
that
delivers
into
a
dry
and
bright
wild
berry
finish
with
ending
notes
of
cherry
green
grapes
and
what
might
be
some
subtle
earthy
raw
pumpkin
cheers
to
something
different
amongst
the
pumpkin
category
sour
lovers
this
might
be
right
up
your
alley
this
is
an
interesting
spin
on
a
pumpkin
beer
refreshing
pumpkin
spices
are
there
but
not
overpowering
the
signature
jp
tartness
adds
another
interesting
element
that
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
o
a
pretty
decent
beer
though
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
pumpkin
ale
its
more
of
a
saison
or
wild
ale
still
its
tasty
and
refreshingly
tart
i
guess
id
say
that
this
is
pretty
weak
in
terms
of
a
pumpkin
beer
not
an
aweful
lot
of
pumpkin
involved
unfortunately
it
is
a
good
sour
to
introduce
nubs
to
sour
beers
this
is
a
dry
and
tart
offering
with
a
crispness
to
the
finish
that
makes
it
easy
to
go
back
for
more
it
is
medium
bodied
and
modestly
carbonated
i
guess
if
you
were
expecting
the
typical
pumpkin
offering
here
you
would
be
very
dissapointment
however
in
true
jp
fashion
i
found
this
to
be
wild
and
enjoyable
my
wife
thinks
its
okay
im
finding
it
difficult
to
finish
overall
i
dont
really
pick
up
any
pumpkin
but
its
a
decent
sour
that
being
said
i
would
go
for
another
one
of
their
offerings
before
i
went
back
to
this
one
overall
definitely
an
interesting
take
but
still
id
rather
have
a
pumpkin
ale
and
a
saison
separate
instead
of
together
my
wife
isnt
into
anything
sour
and
immediately
turned
her
nose
up
at
it
overall
this
really
should
be
classified
as
a
wild
ale
as
that
clearly
takes
precedent
over
the
pumpkin
and
spices
either
way
this
is
a
great
and
very
refreshing
beer
muddy
yellowbrown
pour
with
a
small
white
head
what
remains
of
the
head
laces
nicely
down
the
side
of
my
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
spices
pumpkin
gingerbread
very
malty
taste
follow
the
smell
with
some
light
pumpkin
emphasis
on
the
spice
but
not
without
a
nice
balance
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
very
bubbly
aftertaste
is
dry
i
thought
this
was
nothing
special
in
terms
of
pumpkin
ales
tasty
but
not
worth
the
price
lets
be
honest
jolly
pumpkin
is
a
great
brewery
but
as
of
late
all
their
beers
seem
to
taste
the
same
save
a
few
theyre
all
dominated
by
the
tart
and
funky
nature
of
their
beers
that
i
dont
think
let
the
underlying
flavors
come
through
like
they
should
enjoyable
drinkable
but
youd
never
know
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
pumpkin
ale
oi
would
rate
this
higher
if
i
were
reviewing
this
as
a
wild
ale
i
was
hoping
for
a
pumpkin
fix
and
got
something
else
decent
beer
otherwise
od
jolly
pumpkin
beers
are
always
fun
to
taste
because
they
are
so
unique
in
terms
of
style
and
flavor
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
i
really
couldnt
find
much
in
the
way
of
pumpkin
characteristics
d
strange
beer
a
lot
of
jp
funk
with
just
hints
of
anything
else
still
enjoyable
i
would
not
describe
this
as
a
pumpkin
ale
forget
about
pumpkin
and
enjoy
the
wild
ale
for
what
it
is
light
body
with
minimal
carbonation
but
still
very
refreshing
really
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
an
interesting
beer
though
the
pumpkin
seems
to
be
an
afterthought
for
a
nice
wild
ale
this
is
good
could
be
a
bit
better
with
more
flavor
i
will
however
have
no
issues
finishing
this
o
not
what
i
expected
but
very
golf
had
i
known
it
was
going
to
be
a
sour
i
wouldnt
have
tries
to
enjoy
it
with
a
pumpkin
pie
if
you
want
to
try
a
sour
pumpkin
then
give
this
a
shot
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
last
week
that
said
it
was
bottled
in
2009
i
enjoyed
that
one
a
bit
more
and
thought
the
flavors
were
more
pronounced
so
maybe
ill
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
to
age
served
on
tap
presented
in
a
9
oz
wine
glass
this
beer
was
a
hazy
copperyorange
color
with
a
small
wispy
white
head
that
left
pretty
much
no
lacing
at
all
i
got
very
little
aroma
from
this
beer
but
still
there
were
traces
of
funky
yeast
light
spice
and
a
gently
breadiness
with
a
touch
of
apple
skin
i
was
expecting
something
much
more
sour
with
this
but
it
was
pretty
mild
and
approachable
in
the
taste
actually
grassy
to
be
sure
woody
with
hints
of
apple
peach
and
lemon
pith
a
little
barnyard
funk
with
a
easy
tartness
that
didnt
make
me
flinch
for
even
a
second
mildly
spicy
i
really
got
little
to
no
pumpkin
from
this
at
all
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
though
there
was
a
little
twang
in
the
aftertaste
that
just
didnt
sit
right
still
nice
overall
a
really
refreshing
change
in
the
pumpkin
ale
monotony
id
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
appreciates
jps
other
offerings
although
id
like
a
little
more
flavor
in
this
its
a
really
nice
twist
on
the
pumpkin
ale
style
im
glad
its
in
the
mix
a
light
and
effervescent
drink
with
only
a
touch
of
dry
malt
to
hold
it
down
the
pumpkin
is
basically
undetectable
though
i
anticipate
it
will
go
well
with
my
butternut
squash
dinner
and
so
is
cacao
the
oak
is
accounted
for
as
promised
a
fair
proportion
of
drier
malt
flavors
biscuitbreadcrust
hop
contribution
is
welcome
and
effective
pours
a
brownamber
color
with
almost
zero
head
and
little
carbonation
very
cloudy
in
appearance
nose
is
a
little
underwhelming
but
not
bad
the
main
things
i
get
are
a
little
funk
tartness
and
squash
as
well
as
a
couple
spices
taste
is
about
the
same
as
the
nose
profile
but
its
so
weak
almost
nothing
to
this
beer
tastewise
feel
is
thin
and
fizzy
overall
this
is
by
far
the
most
disappointing
brew
ive
had
from
this
brewery
and
im
a
fan
i
dont
think
ill
look
for
this
one
again
ill
stick
w
some
of
their
better
brews
cheers
the
body
is
light
with
somewhat
sharp
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
wild
ale
not
sure
how
it
stands
up
as
a
pumpkin
ale
however
either
way
it
tasty
this
is
enjoyable
its
just
a
jolly
pumpkin
wild
ale
with
a
bit
of
a
pumpkin
aftertaste
bottled
82010
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
slowly
diminishes
scent
is
typical
jp
funk
with
a
lot
of
pepper
and
spice
the
cacao
is
very
faint
as
well
as
the
pumpkin
taste
is
wow
much
more
sour
than
i
was
expecting
i
always
expect
some
tartness
from
jps
beers
but
this
one
has
a
lot
autumn
spices
blended
with
funky
sour
farmhouse
flavors
as
the
beer
warms
the
pumpkin
spices
come
through
very
slightly
nice
bread
flavors
as
well
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
highly
carbonated
could
be
a
little
less
airy
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
pumpkin
beer
although
i
feel
that
people
who
love
pumpkin
beers
will
not
like
this
one
overall
this
is
an
amazing
pumpkin
beer
which
is
incredibly
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
love
it
cheers
figured
id
try
all
the
pumpkin
beers
at
my
disposal
while
theyre
here
so
that
means
a
probably
sour
one
should
be
mixed
in
with
all
the
spicy
others
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
auburnamber
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
nutmeg
clove
light
banana
peel
honeydew
tart
pineapple
blood
orange
and
a
touch
of
honey
the
taste
hols
notes
of
melon
rind
lightly
sour
grapefruit
rind
pumpkin
shell
lemon
zest
iceberg
lettuce
clove
and
a
hint
of
white
wine
grape
the
melon
and
pumpkin
rinds
seem
to
overpower
everything
else
destroying
any
hope
of
spicing
and
even
oertaking
the
sour
aspects
which
dont
even
try
to
resist
being
drowned
out
the
body
is
a
limpid
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oily
feel
overall
this
beer
just
missed
the
mark
for
me
there
was
definitely
a
pumpkin
character
but
it
was
all
rind
and
it
conspired
with
the
melon
flavors
to
destroy
pretty
much
everything
else
not
a
big
fan
here

d
atrocious
pumpkin
beer
and
a
solidly
mediocre
wild
jp
makes
some
good
beer
but
this
isnt
one
of
them
terrible
price
as
well
13
o
light
and
decent
flavors
but
there
was
just
something
about
this
beer
that
i
didnt
quite
love
worth
a
taste
though
d
while
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
and
feel
its
very
drinkable
i
would
say
it
poorly
depicts
pumpkin
ales
but
still
good
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
likely
much
better
fresh
it
was
predictably
jolly
pumpkin
which
is
both
refreshing
and
a
bit
of
a
bore
i
would
have
preferred
more
of
everything
in
this
beer
and
less
much
less
brett
poured
a
golden
brown
with
some
brownblack
floaties
in
there
huge
fluffy
white
head
and
solid
lacing
great
looking
minus
the
floaties
nose
is
typical
jp
sour
lemon
and
wheat
some
moderate
spicing
nutmeg
perhaps
but
no
real
pumpkin
character
to
speak
of
taste
has
more
sour
lemon
and
some
less
notable
autumn
flavours
but
again
nothing
distinctly
pumpkin
spicing
comes
through
in
the
finish
no
cacao
like
the
label
indicates
light
feel
high
carbonation
moderate
but
not
distinct
enjoy
to
be
thoroughly
enjoyable
more
tart
than
the
panil
barrique
italy
version
when
tasted
side
by
side
o
where
this
kinda
failed
as
a
pure
pumpkinyam
beer
it
totally
rocked
as
a
sour
aile
to
me
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
again
proves
to
be
a
bit
richer
and
more
balanced
in
the
bottle
malt
character
is
more
developed
and
there
is
more
of
a
graduation
in
flavor
in
the
feel
as
the
mineral
rich
backbone
sort
of
subsides
and
creates
some
awesome
tone
sour
tart
as
expected
with
a
floral
perfume
like
sour
this
is
backed
with
a
mild
pumpkin
japanese
yam
quality
there
is
some
nutmeg
and
autumn
applo
but
its
more
refreshing
then
bread
and
overspicing
very
food
particular
i
would
have
it
with
teriyaki
more
balance
as
in
allows
for
spice
to
come
through
o
this
beer
blew
me
away
shattered
my
expectations
this
is
not
so
much
a
pumpkin
ale
as
it
is
a
saison
to
enjoy
during
the
colder
months
it
aged
very
well
too
perhaps
the
pumpkin
and
spice
is
more
noticeable
the
fresher
it
gets
i
hope
so
and
i
plan
on
finding
a
bottle
of
this
years
batch
to
compare
kens
bomber
where
is
the
pumpkin
spicey
smell
is
muted
without
a
trace
of
the
pumpkin
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
very
different
from
most
pumpkin
ales
the
heavy
spice
and
high
alcohol
are
traded
for
a
more
aged
tart
flavor
in
the
pumpkin
definitely
try
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
ranks
among
the
top
five
jp
brews
ive
had
plenty
of
sweet
and
pumpkin
ale
flavors
to
classify
as
a
pumpkin
ale
with
a
smooth
balanced
complexity
between
funk
and
pumpkin
overall
a
really
strange
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
but
i
wouldnt
buy
again
overall
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
based
on
the
price
and
the
use
of
the
word
pumpkin
in
the
name
however
if
youre
into
sours
you
might
like
this
one
o
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
love
the
tartness
thats
in
jolly
pumpkin
beers
for
a
pumpkin
beer
it
would
be
nice
if
the
pumpkin
was
stronger
and
the
body
was
thickened
up
some
but
over
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
worth
picking
up
if
you
see
it
around
bottle
from
082010
thanks
to
nishino
dark
chestnut
color
with
a
huge
head
looks
enticing
the
first
whiff
off
the
bottle
is
funky
the
aromas
from
the
glass
are
spicy
and
a
little
brett
but
no
distinct
pumpkin
or
cinnamon
smells
good
though
the
mouthfeel
was
outstanding
felt
like
a
cask
beer
rich
creamy
smooth
the
flavor
had
a
bit
of
spice
but
was
heavy
on
the
jp
funk
it
was
very
very
slightly
sour
but
didnt
make
me
pucker
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
o
jolly
pumpkin
makes
a
good
beer
almost
always
this
beer
was
good
but
there
was
almost
no
pumpkin
quality
to
this
this
of
course
doesnt
say
i
didnt
like
it
but
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
pumpkin
to
it
a
nice
beer
in
its
own
just
not
quite
to
the
style
i
thought
it
should
be
overall
this
isnt
something
id
seek
out
more
than
once
interesting
though
jp
a
funk
like
none
other
thanks
o
if
you
like
sour
beers
or
other
jolly
pumpkin
beers
than
this
is
for
you
but
not
to
my
liking
drinkability
is
ok
nothing
special
an
average
wild
ale
nothing
really
stands
out
from
the
other
jps
with
similar
malt
base
i
wont
bother
buying
again
if
i
want
a
wild
ale
i
want
more
funk
and
no
gourde
if
i
want
a
pumpkin
ale
i
want
a
richer
maltier
base
and
distinct
pumpkin
flavors

pours
a
hazy
orangeamber
color
with
a
2
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
theat
stayed
around
a
long
time
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
well
i
dont
smell
any
pumpkin
in
this
beer
it
smells
like
tart
apples
funk
lemon
peel
and
some
nutmeg
which
i
dont
notice
until
after
the
beer
has
been
opened
for
a
while
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
its
mostly
sour
and
funky
until
the
beer
has
warmed
up
more
and
then
the
pumpkin
spices
are
a
little
bit
noticable
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
and
it
has
high
but
soft
carbonation
which
helps
makes
this
easy
to
drink
overall
i
think
its
a
good
beer
even
though
its
pricey
at
12
99
a
bottle
maybe
i
should
try
this
fresher
next
time
even
though
i
liked
it
just
fine
with
some
age
on
it
this
was
not
an
easy
translation
but
it
seems
as
though
la
parcela
means
the
patch
as
in
pumpkin
patch
presumably
my
view
is
that
this
seasonal
brew
needs
a
pretty
massive
patch
of
a
different
sort
since
its
one
flat
tire
of
a
pumpkin
ale
ease
off
the
wild
yeast
already
pours
a
slightly
hazed
copper
color
moderate
plume
of
off
white
bubbles
short
lasting
with
little
retention
beneath
the
first
sour
tart
and
funky
scents
lies
a
hint
of
vegtable
applegrape
scents
and
mild
spicing
taste
breings
a
decent
amount
of
pumpkin
very
vegetal
and
dull
not
sweet
pumpkin
pie
the
tart
and
funk
take
over
and
the
beer
finnishes
with
touches
of
fruit
and
spice
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
nice
carbonation
used
to
the
bottle
condioned
versions
having
very
high
levels
dry
a
nice
take
on
the
pumpkin
beer
which
focuses
on
the
natural
flavor
of
the
vegtable
with
that
typical
jolly
pumpkin
mild
tart
sour
and
funkyness
verdict
while
i
was
let
down
by
the
fact
that
this
was
supposed
to
jolly
pumpkins
true
pumpkin
beer
and
it
tasted
very
little
like
pumpkin
i
was
still
impressed
with
balanced
sour
lemongrass
and
slight
earthy
gourd
notes
i
easily
downed
this
bottle
in
no
time
at
all
and
enjoyed
every
drop
drinkability
very
hohum
didnt
finish
it
and
moved
on
certainly
not
jolly
pumpkins
top
offering
drinkability
is
moderate
to
good
as
this
definitely
has
some
unique
flavor
combinations
going
on
that
may
take
some
time
to
get
used
to
d
a
very
tasty
beer
and
an
interesting
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
which
is
what
i
would
expect
from
a
brewery
like
jp
definitely
worth
seeking
out
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
high
it
feels
very
crisp
and
light
overall
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
nice
flavors
to
it
overall
had
i
been
expecting
a
typical
pumpkin
ale
id
be
disappointed
knowing
that
was
more
like
an
american
wild
going
in
helped
my
appreciation
of
it
pretty
nice
beer
overall
poured
from
a
18
bomber
the
most
i
paid
when
evaluating
oktoberfestautumn
beers
into
dimpled
mug
i
expected
more
out
of
this
highlytouted
pumpkin
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
orange
with
a
small
white
head
with
a
small
amount
of
sediment
floating
around
big
aroma
consisting
of
pumpkin
sour
yeast
spices
nutmeg
cloves
coriander
with
an
almost
mentholated
funk
largely
tart
flavor
minerals
grassy
upfront
with
the
pumpkin
flavors
subtlety
lingering
behind
a
large
layer
of
funk
acidic
and
somewhat
hopppy
high
level
of
carbonation
usher
in
spices
and
funk
that
roll
into
an
acidic
finish
pours
a
pillowy
four
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
very
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
ton
of
yeast
left
in
bottle
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
nose
is
tart
spices
and
flavor
is
tart
spicy
with
some
pumpkin
like
a
mellow
farmhouse
ale
not
the
usual
pumpkin
pie
ale
beyond
expensive
at
18
50
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
batch
610
bottled
8202010
overall
a
refreshingly
different
take
on
pumpkin
ale
doesnt
have
the
usual
malty
and
pie
spice
flavors
or
the
same
thick
mouth
feel
at
all
the
real
criticism
is
that
the
pumpkin
flavors
and
aromas
are
next
to
absent
so
im
having
a
hard
time
with
it
being
categorized
with
the
others
if
i
didnt
know
that
it
is
actually
brewed
with
real
pumpkin
id
just
assume
it
was
a
farmhousesaison
style
ale
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
but
i
was
definitely
a
bit
underwhelmed
a
jolly
pumpkin
pumpkin
beer
how
appropriate
pours
a
vibrant
orangey
gold
amber
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
nice
retention
as
with
most
jp
beers
the
aroma
has
that
trademark
subtle
oaky
brett
funk
rounded
out
by
a
nice
mellow
sweet
squash
notes
and
a
mild
spice
man
this
is
how
pumpkin
beers
should
be
i
must
say
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
glut
of
pumpkin
beers
that
are
around
in
the
fall
but
this
is
excellent
its
got
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
hints
and
wisps
of
clove
allspice
nutmeg
and
actual
pumpkin
these
are
accents
to
a
nice
base
of
a
slightly
sour
very
refreshing
pale
malt
style
ale
rounded
out
by
oak
and
a
funky
bite
excellently
dry
on
the
palate
definitely
the
new
benchmark
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
never
wouldve
thought
that
funk
and
pumpkin
would
go
so
well
together
drinkability
those
grumbling
for
ever
less
pumpkin
and
less
spice
character
should
consider
giving
this
one
a
try
as
both
are
virtually
absent
at
least
in
batch
610
as
always
its
another
weird
wild
ride
from
jolly
pumpkin
cheers
d
this
ones
not
for
me
and
not
what
i
would
consider
a
good
representation
of
a
pumpkin
ale
if
this
was
labeled
an
american
wild
it
would
have
probably
been
a
different
story
very
interesting
and
very
unique
i
wouldnt
say
its
my
favorite
beer
but
its
something
different
than
anything
ive
had
before
and
the
overall
its
well
constructed
and
surprisingly
enjoyable
d
okay
but
a
little
too
much
spice
flavors
they
just
dont
mix
well
with
the
tartfunky
flavors
also
going
on
and
the
flavors
linger
a
little
too
long
into
the
finish
takes
a
little
getting
used
to
but
pretty
good
overall
i
can
the
find
the
pumpkin
ale
in
it
if
i
concentrate
but
its
like
they
took
one
aspect
of
it
really
emphasized
it
good
but
one
is
satisfying
d
this
is
a
really
cool
and
different
beer
enjoying
the
750
ml
bomber
by
yourself
is
not
hard
to
do
but
i
feel
this
would
be
better
splitting
with
someone
kind
of
is
like
a
mix
of
a
saison
a
wild
ale
and
a
pumpkin
ale
beer
pours
s
beautiful
burnt
orange
with
an
ever
so
slightly
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
ever
so
slowly
leaving
nice
lacing
and
a
perfect
thin
layer
on
top
of
the
beer
definitely
looks
like
a
pumpkin
ale
and
a
nice
one
at
that
smell
starts
as
a
tart
apple
and
follows
with
a
scent
of
pumpkin
pie
that
mixes
fresh
pumpkin
with
nutmeg
allspice
and
light
cinnamon
i
also
get
a
light
caramel
note
that
is
very
nice
and
adds
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
to
balance
the
tart
and
spicy
aroma
the
taste
is
sour
apple
with
a
light
hit
of
vinegar
upfront
but
its
followed
a
very
nice
bit
of
mild
pumpkin
that
adds
a
little
balance
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
the
beer
finishes
dry
and
sour
but
in
a
very
mild
drinkable
way
the
sourness
is
definitely
there
but
not
kicking
you
in
the
face
like
some
beers
do
again
a
very
nice
balance
throughout
the
beer
leading
to
a
very
drinkable
sour
beer
that
i
keep
going
back
to
for
sip
after
sip
i
hope
jolly
pumpkin
makes
this
one
again
next
fall
as
i
will
be
grabbing
a
few
of
them
bottle
from
december
santa
cruz
tasting
pours
a
light
bronze
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
spackled
lace
chunks
acetic
aroma
with
obvious
pumpkin
pie
spice
notes
flavor
is
much
the
same
very
tart
and
vinegary
notes
cut
by
cocoa
and
nutmeg
sweetness
theres
also
a
pumpkin
flesh
note
pretty
interesting
overall
a
nice
light
sour
that
had
some
good
dimensions
to
it
a
definite
change
of
pace
for
me
and
one
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
d
certainly
enjoyable
and
quite
different
from
what
one
might
expect
from
a
pumpkin
ale
but
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
jolly
pumpkin
jolly
pumpkin
finally
makes
a
pumpkin
ale
and
its
different
then
anybody
else
a
very
delicious
and
approachable
sour
that
is
not
vinegary
and
will
not
rip
your
teeth
enamel
off
seek
it
out
d
as
a
beer
solid
as
a
pumpkin
beer
not
so
much
kudos
to
jolly
pumpkin
for
giving
this
a
shot
but
for
better
or
worse
it
doesnt
really
fit
into
the
style
bring
a
friend
overall
not
much
pumpkin
on
this
2009
bottle
pretty
enjoyable
d
this
is
my
kind
of
pumpkin
beer
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
wish
there
was
a
slightly
more
prominent
pumpkin
flavor
overall
very
good
though
i
cant
detect
much
pumpkin
in
it
of
course
i
wouldnt
question
anything
my
main
peeps
from
jolly
pumpkin
do
because
whatever
else
this
is
its
a
refreshing
and
unique
take
on
the
style
and
whats
more
its
a
damn
fine
drinking
beer
its
a
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
who
have
certainly
carved
hoho
an
interesting
niche
for
themselves
a
very
unique
take
on
the
pumpkin
ale
style
and
one
that
really
shows
what
you
can
do
with
it
lovely
poured
a
murky
golden
orange
with
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
half
finger
of
head
and
left
some
bubbly
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
i
could
definitely
detect
the
pumpkin
but
it
was
quite
funky
from
the
brett
character
with
slight
spice
notes
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
notes
really
intresting
nose
the
taste
was
also
a
mash
up
of
brettyy
oaky
funky
pumpkin
flavors
with
all
spice
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
accents
but
had
tart
slight
acidic
notes
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
prickly
carbonation
which
had
a
oaky
funky
spice
tart
and
prickly
bubbly
finish
it
drank
really
good
and
was
well
balanced
between
the
pumpkin
flavors
and
the
bretty
funk
qualities
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
elusive
pumpkin
beer
d
im
sort
of
a
sucker
for
jolly
pumpkin
beers
so
i
was
pretty
sure
i
would
like
this
not
sure
if
its
worth
the
price
but
i
enjoyed
it
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
it
is
tasting
to
me
as
good
as
some
of
the
best
belgian
fruit
beers
i
like
the
taste
and
the
fact
that
it
is
a
low
abv
at
6
a
highly
sessionable
ale
d
im
a
huge
fan
of
jps
ales
and
this
one
is
no
exception
id
class
it
as
more
of
a
sour
rather
than
in
the
vegetablespiceherb
class
the
pumpkin
is
muted
and
the
sour
really
overshadows
it
drinkability
i
definitely
liked
this
beer
the
more
i
drank
it
the
alcohol
is
concealed
well
and
it
is
quite
refreshing
if
it
wasnt
expensive
i
would
drink
it
quite
often
typical
jolly
pumpkin
beer
for
better
or
worse
lots
of
tangy
sourness
up
front
that
obscure
the
other
ingredients
a
bit
you
have
to
wait
for
the
finish
for
the
other
notes
to
shine
through
pours
amber
with
some
cloudiness
and
a
fair
number
of
suspended
particles
which
definitely
makes
it
a
bit
murky
smells
tart
with
some
spice
notes
that
develop
and
some
apple
the
taste
is
similar
quite
tart
with
green
apple
notes
up
front
along
with
some
sharp
spiciness
that
develops
further
toward
the
finish
and
finally
some
creamy
cocoa
and
nutmeg
notes
at
the
very
end
tart
and
crisp
but
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
at
the
end
not
bad
but
you
cant
tell
its
a
pumpkin
beer
d
pretty
impressive
very
very
different
but
they
finally
brewed
a
pumpkin
beer
and
it
has
the
brettanomyces
and
oak
flavors
that
highlight
all
of
their
beers
this
was
isnt
bad
at
all
and
offers
something
familiar
to
jolly
pumpkins
fans
dcertainly
an
easy
drinker
for
those
looking
for
a
holiday
ale
to
share
with
friends
pours
a
bright
clear
orange
with
about
an
inch
of
brilliant
white
foamy
head
that
leaves
attractive
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
overwhelmed
by
the
musty
funkiness
of
jolly
pumpkins
signature
yeast
strain
which
is
one
of
the
most
distinctive
and
unique
in
american
craft
brewing
some
balsamic
vinegar
acidity
peeks
through
and
just
the
slightest
trace
of
pumpkin
pie
spice
first
impressions
do
not
indicate
that
this
beer
contains
pumpkin
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
may
throw
you
for
a
loop
as
its
surprisingly
sweet
for
a
jolly
pumpkin
beer
youre
hit
with
a
burst
of
intense
brown
sugar
and
toffee
sweetness
that
disappears
almost
instantly
revealing
a
crisp
sharp
funkiness
that
fades
into
light
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
hints
of
mild
pumpkin
sweetness
the
back
end
is
subtly
tart
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
prickly
invigorating
carbonation
probably
the
most
drinkable
example
of
the
style
ive
tried
simultaneously
rich
and
refreshing
rating
to
style
this
is
a
great
achievement
drinkability
not
bad
and
its
a
nice
seasonal
treat
that
i
was
happy
to
get
a
hold
of
this
is
one
that
i
dont
think
that
i
would
want
to
try
to
age
as
i
feel
the
spiciness
would
fade
out
too
much
and
it
would
become
a
bit
boring
nice
flavors
that
keep
it
interesting
and
a
solid
fun
mouthfeel
while
its
not
something
that
i
would
reach
for
on
a
daily
basis
its
definitely
something
ill
look
forward
to
again
d
easy
drinker
the
sour
aspect
takes
some
away
as
well
as
the
funky
aspects
but
wow
if
you
are
looking
for
a
traditional
spiced
pumpkin
ale
i
suggest
walking
away
from
this
one
if
you
are
instead
tired
of
a
lot
of
the
boring
pumpkin
ales
out
there
dont
hesitate
to
grab
this
one
2010
bottle
pours
a
clear
rosy
peach
orange
with
lots
of
bubbles
flying
around
and
a
thick
white
head
nose
is
very
typical
jolly
pumpkin
house
funk
of
course
a
good
dose
of
oak
tart
apples
maybe
some
light
cinnamon
or
allspice
there
actually
is
a
nice
pumpkin
tone
in
the
flavor
that
i
wasnt
expecting
as
i
thought
this
would
pretty
much
be
an
exact
replica
of
fuego
del
otono
pumpkin
comes
across
with
a
light
sweetness
balanced
by
a
light
sour
oak
and
spices
as
i
expected
light
flavor
profile
nonoffensive
though
not
exciting
to
me
standard
for
the
recent
jolly
pumpkin
batches
just
not
the
same
rich
barrel
presence
and
flavor
expressions
of
years
past
medium
body
dry
almost
puckering
sour
at
times
lively
drinking
bright
flavor
and
probably
the
first
pumpkin
beer
i
actually
liked
lower
abv
is
nice
too
allowing
the
tart
and
flavor
to
shine
without
any
alcohol
warmth
d
the
tartness
and
spices
in
this
beer
make
it
one
that
probably
needs
to
be
sipped
overall
a
good
beer
but
could
have
been
better
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
this
feel
good
in
my
mouth
it
isnt
as
carbed
as
other
jp
offerings
that
literally
jump
out
of
the
bottle
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
i
cant
help
but
wonder
if
this
is
a
trick
while
i
enjoyed
this
i
can
imagine
jp
would
do
much
much
better
with
this
beer
if
they
abandoned
the
less
is
more
routine
for
one
seasonal
to
me
a
seasoned
beer
drinker
this
is
a
treat
to
be
savored
to
an
average
beer
drinker
taking
a
chance
on
a
beer
described
as
having
spices
and
cacao
nibs
this
may
be
a
dissapointment
d
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
funky
pumpkin
beer
gotta
love
it
a
somewhat
unique
take
on
the
pumpkin
beer
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
pretty
easy
drinker
with
lots
of
character
d
interesting
beer
for
sure
i
got
more
of
a
classic
jp
beer
compared
to
a
pumpkin
beer
this
is
nowhere
near
as
overt
as
most
pumpkin
beers
on
the
market
but
it
is
tasty
and
with
the
dearth
of
pumpkin
beers
in
ca
it
was
certainly
nice
to
see
another
one
drinkability
flavorful
a
bit
unique
for
a
pumpkin
beer
drinkability
definitely
going
to
pick
up
another
bottle
of
this
not
the
typical
overly
sweet
pumpkin
pie
spiced
bomb
very
enjoyable
and
interesting
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
while
still
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
from
jolly
pumpkin
this
is
still
one
of
the
more
interesting
pumpkin
beers
out
there
assuming
this
beer
even
qualifies
there
really
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
pumpkin
going
on
at
this
point
not
terrible
sampled
this
one
for
halloween
typical
jp
pour
meaning
nice
carbonation
and
nice
head
dark
auburn
body
nice
off
white
head
aroma
is
all
jp
funk
and
to
be
honest
not
that
different
from
la
roja
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
taste
follows
suite
some
oak
some
dark
fruits
and
apples
lightly
tart
and
funky
but
spice
not
getting
it
not
getting
it
in
the
nose
not
getting
it
in
the
taste
that
being
said
this
is
a
delicious
beer
and
i
would
definately
buy
it
again
but
as
a
pumpkin
beer
this
one
falls
short
d
la
parcela
holds
no
secrets
its
more
tolerable
as
the
beer
warms
but
i
became
tired
of
the
beer
halfway
through
the
bottle
there
just
isnt
enough
complexity
or
enough
pumpkin
different
than
your
average
pumpkin
beer
i
wonder
if
it
is
in
the
right
category
maybe
wild
ale
but
you
just
gotta
love
jolly
pumpkin
taste
the
acidic
tartness
takes
center
stage
like
in
other
jolly
pumpkin
beers
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
noticeable
fairly
quickly
but
the
spices
dont
emerge
until
after
the
tartness
has
subsided
a
very
nice
interesting
take
on
a
pumpkin
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
drinkability
so
much
so
i
really
wish
i
could
find
this
on
tap
out
here
nonexistent
in
ca
sadly
because
if
i
did
i
would
drink
about
10
pints
of
these
not
over
the
top
like
some
of
the
other
jp
beers
where
a
bomber
is
plenty
this
one
is
insanely
easy
to
quaff
and
as
stated
the
flavors
really
do
meld
into
making
this
a
nice
sweet
and
sour
beer
damn
good
damn
enjoyable
very
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
la
parcela
pours
somewhere
between
a
crystal
clear
orange
and
deep
goldenrod
depending
on
the
lighting
the
slightly
off
white
head
is
massive
filling
half
the
glass
it
sticks
around
for
a
while
to
boot
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
just
a
bit
more
and
la
parcela
would
have
garnered
a
5
for
looks
the
nose
is
completely
dominated
by
whatever
critters
jp
put
into
this
beer
its
straight
funk
with
just
a
touch
of
vinegar
skulking
around
in
the
background
i
expected
la
parcela
to
be
much
more
of
a
wild
ale
than
a
pumpkin
one
at
this
point
but
i
can
still
find
evidence
of
its
pumkinness
in
the
flavor
a
brief
swirl
of
brown
sugar
leads
off
before
the
wild
influence
barges
in
to
take
center
stage
as
with
the
nose
its
more
funky
than
sour
but
both
are
definitely
still
present
the
beer
closes
with
a
flourish
from
some
of
the
traditional
pumpkin
ale
spices
predominantly
cinnamon
mouthfeel
is
superb
the
beer
is
light
and
nimble
without
even
suggesting
a
watery
characteristic
in
addition
the
carbonation
while
high
is
a
bit
more
restrained
than
i
find
in
some
wild
ales
its
still
plenty
expressive
but
its
not
bubbly
to
the
point
of
distraction
la
parcela
is
a
great
beer
after
a
year
plus
of
aging
but
i
think
i
might
have
enjoyed
it
a
bit
more
a
little
sooner
when
the
pumpkin
ale
aspects
were
shining
through
a
bit
more
still
all
in
all
a
great
way
to
kick
off
halloween
this
year
pleasant
bite
cut
through
the
earthy
and
tomato
notes
of
my
spicy
chile
nice
wintery
brew
well
worth
seeking
out
much
nicer
than
its
bottle
counter
part
very
effervescent
and
spicy
i
still
think
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
minimal
but
it
was
a
bit
more
sour
yet
still
one
of
the
least
sour
jolly
pumpkin
beers
that
i
have
had
very
murky
but
almost
no
head
but
rather
that
acidic
sizzle
this
however
is
the
one
pumpkin
beer
i
think
that
should
be
released
early
by
the
time
this
comes
out
every
year
it
is
a
little
cold
for
a
refreshing
sour
db
actually
pretty
damn
easy
to
throw
back
due
to
the
body
and
lack
of
fatiguing
sour
i
actually
enjoy
the
spice
mixed
with
the
slight
lactic
a
lot
cant
justify
a
high
grade
due
to
style
and
the
obvious
reason
that
they
call
this
their
pumpkin
beer
a
cool
blend
of
interesting
flavor
i
obviously
wish
the
pumpkin
would
be
bumped
up
a
bit
for
a
fresh
squash
blast
d
a
very
unique
pumpkin
ale
drinks
nice
i
hate
to
say
this
but
it
doesnt
blow
my
doors
off
if
this
was
my
first
jolly
pumpkin
beer
i
am
sure
i
would
feel
differently
overall
the
pumpkin
is
subtle
in
this
one
but
it
is
a
solid
tartslightly
sourfunky
ale
i
like
the
taste
of
this
i
just
wish
there
was
more
pumpkin
reviewing
this
as
a
pumpkin
ale
i
cant
give
it
too
high
of
a
score
for
taste
has
more
saisons
notes
than
anything
else
good
but
jp
has
some
much
better
offerings
than
this
one
d
not
bad
but
certainly
not
even
close
to
the
best
jp
beer
out
there
and
there
are
much
more
interesting
pumpkin
beers
too
easy
drinker
overall
but
nothing
worth
looking
for
d
good
i
had
no
trouble
finishing
the
whole
bottle
if
it
wasnt
so
pricey
id
happily
have
it
again
jolly
pumpkin
is
a
great
brewery
but
their
prices
are
intense
more
complex
than
some
pumpkin
brews
yes
and
i
have
to
give
credit
for
not
just
making
an
imperial
pumpkin
ale
with
spices
like
many
other
breweries
seem
to
be
doing
now
good
for
breaking
the
pumpkin
fall
ale
mold
no
pun
intended
however
it
just
tastes
too
watered
down
and
not
sour
enough
for
it
to
be
worth
the
16
tag
from
a
style
in
which
the
differences
are
usually
minimal
jolly
pumpkin
manages
to
set
itself
apart
pleasant
complexity
and
flavor
progression
drinkability
is
rather
high
sitting
and
having
a
couple
is
certainly
no
chore
one
to
check
out
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
served
from
tap
into
a
snifter
poured
deep
orange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
granny
smith
apple
sweet
malt
and
upon
initial
inspection
i
thought
i
smelled
dirty
diaper
the
diaper
aroma
left
upon
sitting
for
a
minute
thank
god
the
flavor
was
of
slightly
sweet
malt
saison
spices
and
a
subtle
sour
note
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
flavor
was
very
well
balanced
honestly
im
not
sure
where
the
dirty
diaper
smell
came
from
i
was
the
only
person
in
the
place
besides
the
employee
and
he
was
in
the
back
i
also
checked
myself
no
findings
it
left
fortunately
so
it
wasnt
really
a
big
deal
afterall
this
one
is
a
must
try
though
can
you
find
the
diaper
drinkability
its
a
decent
beer
but
its
a
bit
too
acidy
and
a
little
expensive
for
a
pint
so
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
a
couple
certainly
worth
trying
d
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
say
this
was
completely
an
american
wild
ale
i
dont
taste
the
pumpkin
or
the
accompanying
spaces
at
all
i
wouldve
thought
a
brewery
named
jolly
pumpkin
would
produce
a
more
pumpkinlike
brew
and
at
14
99
a
bottle
it
was
completely
not
worth
it
d
a
good
beer
but
didnt
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
pumpkin
to
it
and
the
taste
was
pretty
watered
down
would
try
again
but
wouldnt
seek
out
dm
very
good
but
tough
to
drink
if
you
dont
have
a
palate
for
tart
beers
well
carbonated
and
worth
a
try
glows
orangish
like
a
jackolantern
small
white
head
fades
fast
the
beer
is
slightly
opaque
smells
like
basement
must
lots
of
fresh
pumpkin
and
oak
the
taste
is
complex
kinda
sour
up
front
with
big
raw
pumpkin
flavor
oak
and
cacao
is
real
present
some
other
spices
make
an
apperance
finish
is
lingering
pumpkin
and
funk
great
mouthfeel
real
thick
tasty
tasty
hard
to
review
though
because
its
not
a
traditional
pumpkin
ale
as
it
is
barrel
aged
hazy
pumpkin
orange
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
with
great
retention
and
lace
this
is
one
of
the
better
looking
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
the
nose
is
surprisingly
muted
pumpkin
spice
pumpkin
flesh
low
funk
with
some
vanilla
i
get
some
nutmeg
and
mace
while
it
smells
pleasant
this
isnt
as
flavorful
as
i
was
expecting
palate
opens
mildly
tart
with
the
spices
coming
through
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
moderate
with
the
spices
being
relatively
mild
for
a
change
it
seems
like
this
doesnt
have
the
entire
gamut
of
pumpkin
pie
spices
it
seems
like
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
are
missing
mild
sweetness
is
present
this
is
not
very
funky
arguably
a
little
blah
light
in
body
with
mild
lemon
character
this
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
decent
finish
decent
not
worth
the
high
price
tag
for
bottles
at
least
for
a
pumpkin
ale
i
think
this
is
great
and
im
a
big
fan
of
pumpkin
beers
guess
these
guys
finally
lived
up
to
their
name
and
are
no
longer
hypocrites
i
guess
now
i
dont
have
to
keep
calling
them
jolly
blump
ok
lets
not
go
there
d
a
little
bit
heavy
for
a
wild
ale
which
is
what
im
thinking
of
it
as
at
this
point
but
pretty
drinkable
i
think
the
spice
and
weight
of
it
might
make
it
hard
to
drink
for
some
but
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
enjoyable
and
think
i
would
get
the
full
effect
of
what
this
beer
is
really
about
after
three
or
so
glasses
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
pumpkin
beer
the
earthy
funkiness
was
a
great
complement
to
the
pumpkin
flavor
which
i
wasnt
sure
how
it
would
work
solid
pumpkin
beer
but
15
a
750ml
will
probably
keep
me
from
exoring
again
pours
a
really
nice
hazy
copperorange
with
an
off
white
head
decent
amount
of
lace
on
the
way
down
nose
brings
definite
notes
of
pumpkin
along
with
some
oak
and
a
bit
of
earth
some
funk
but
not
too
much
taste
brings
some
light
pumpkin
flavor
and
slight
sourness
mostly
earth
and
oak
along
with
accompanying
funk
feel
is
light
and
dry
drinks
quite
well
and
one
of
the
better
and
most
unique
pumpkin
beers
out
there
pumpkin
beer
im
not
convinced
but
im
a
sucked
for
sour
beers
and
i
love
jp
stuff
so
i
cant
bring
myself
to
give
this
one
to
low
of
scores
because
it
is
good
this
beer
isnt
very
drinkable
for
two
reasons
one
this
beer
is
heavy
you
may
not
taste
the
pumpkin
that
much
but
you
sure
feel
it
and
second
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
dry
after
a
pint
of
this
i
couldnt
have
any
more
until
i
drank
a
similar
amount
of
water
not
that
im
against
drinking
water
with
beer
but
i
think
i
should
be
able
to
drink
two
pints
of
a
sub
7
beer
without
water
in
between
the
beer
tastes
mildly
tart
a
little
sweet
too
hints
of
actual
pumpkin
and
even
less
of
pumpkin
pie
this
tasted
nearly
perfect
for
a
pumpkin
ale
i
wish
they
could
all
add
a
dose
of
bret
it
works
well
overall
this
was
certainly
one
of
the
more
interesting
pumpkin
beers
ive
ever
had
unfortunately
i
dont
think
the
style
lends
itself
to
what
jp
does
best
i
dont
foresee
myself
revisiting
this
one
but
if
you
havent
had
it
then
its
certainly
worth
trying
drinkability
good
definitely
not
anything
close
to
the
typical
pumpkin
ale
but
very
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
a
hazy
light
amberorange
brew
with
lacy
white
head
and
lots
of
light
bubbly
carbonation
aroma
of
funk
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
tartness
its
really
hard
to
pick
out
any
pumpkin
spice
or
cocoa
nevertheless
this
one
not
your
typical
pumpkin
ale
rather
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
crisp
dry
fruity
finish
with
perhaps
some
lingering
spice
thanks
to
drdogbeer
for
the
try
pours
just
like
apple
cider
but
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
aromas
of
indistinguishable
fruit
pear
pumpkin
maybe
typical
funky
jolly
pumpkin
yeast
sweaty
socks
and
white
pepper
flavor
is
similar
with
more
tart
apples
presence
the
pumpkin
is
evident
somewhere
in
there
but
it
isnt
pronounced
nice
sourtartness
that
finishes
bracingly
dry
on
the
end
of
the
high
carbonation
quite
enjoyable
not
gonna
lie
for
all
its
good
qualities
i
have
no
desire
to
drink
more
than
my
half
of
the
shared
bottle
d
i
have
to
say
not
one
of
my
favorite
jp
beers
simply
because
they
do
refreshing
saisons
better
than
anyone
and
thats
what
i
love
about
this
brewery
this
one
is
a
little
harder
to
drink
definitely
not
for
everybody
i
get
the
joke
jp
needed
to
make
a
pumpkin
beer
and
this
is
it
though
it
is
just
the
typical
sour
and
funky
jp
beer
just
kind
of
nondescript
sour
at
that
not
much
nuance
that
i
usually
get
from
their
funky
farmhouse
beers
i
really
like
most
of
their
beers
but
this
is
a
style
that
just
does
not
go
with
funk
interesting
to
try
once
but
that
is
it
pours
a
clean
orangeish
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
sour
white
grapes
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
in
the
taste
green
apple
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
a
dry
pumpkin
under
all
that
almost
cider
like
a
spicy
bite
and
a
light
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
cider
like
and
small
spice
aftertaste
not
so
much
pumpkin
but
spicy
and
almost
cider
like
this
is
a
good
effort
but
not
my
favorite
jp
brew
d
this
is
pretty
good
but
i
wish
i
would
have
drank
it
when
it
was
fresher
but
still
another
good
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
the
body
is
medium
and
carbonation
is
high
and
appropriate
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
definitely
one
of
the
better
jolly
pumpkins
i
have
tried
i
would
like
to
get
a
chance
to
try
this
a
bit
fresher
perhaps
there
will
be
more
pumpkinspice
recommended
if
you
like
sours
and
funky
saisons
i
hope
jolly
pumpkin
makes
this
again
i
liked
this
beer
a
bunch
but
after
6
months
of
cellaring
i
think
the
pumpkin
qualities
faded
significantly
this
is
an
exceedingly
fantastic
pumpkin
beer
definitely
one
of
the
best
commercial
examples
that
i
have
ever
had
i
like
how
appetizing
and
sweet
the
aroma
smells
but
that
the
flavor
is
dry
tart
and
not
anywhere
near
overspiced
the
aroma
actually
reminds
me
of
desert
perhaps
obviously
but
the
flavor
is
in
the
end
quite
savory
i
am
definitely
quite
pleased
to
be
drinking
a
bottle
of
this
right
now
d
i
entered
into
this
with
some
trepedation
they
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
though
thanks
to
ohlrangers

when
i
saw
the
label
and
read
the
description
i
was
12
expecting
a
darker
heartier
brew
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
this
a
very
nice
pumpkin
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
thanks
to
flandersned
for
the
hook
up
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
fast
moving
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
i
cant
say
this
is
my
favorite
jp
beer
a
little
odd
with
the
pumpkin
and
a
bit
astringent
overall
though
a
fun
pumpkin
beer
and
definitely
a
180
on
what
most
standard
pumpkin
beers
are
give
it
a
try
if
you
have
the
access
to
it
not
much
really
going
on
with
this
beer
good
acidic
backbone
some
fruity
esters
hints
of
oak
with
wood
tannins
no
distinguishable
fruit
flavors
light
in
the
mouth
with
a
spritzy
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
nice
strong
bite
of
carbonation
aroma
of
wet
stone
minerals
wine
grapes
lemon
hay
similar
to
a
lambic
later
on
at
room
temp
the
cinnamonnutmeg
is
there
with
some
apple
cider
traces
flavor
has
some
earthy
squashy
elements
but
not
a
heavy
pumpkin
presence
tart
and
dry
with
a
drying
residual
spice
and
identifiable
earthy
pumpkin
in
the
aftertaste
upfront
its
more
tart
with
some
toasted
maltpumpkin
seeds
and
spice
in
the
middle
leaving
the
more
complex
elements
to
linger
in
the
finish
its
slightly
too
astringent
but
other
than
that
it
drinks
very
well
a
750
is
no
problem
in
a
sitting
provided
you
enjoy
sour
ales
good
carbonation
and
wonderful
sourness
in
the
mouthfeel
im
a
huge
fansupporter
of
jolly
pumpkin
and
this
beer
doesnt
disappoint
d
another
good
offering
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
a
good
example
of
a
farmhouse
ale
which
they
can
brew
blind
at
this
point
i
was
expecting
more
spice
pumpkin
and
other
fall
flavors
from
this
one
the
lower
rating
is
based
on
the
fact
that
it
really
doesnt
seem
like
a
pumpkin
ale
to
me
otherwise
its
very
drinkable
and
the
low
alcohol
insures
that
ill
finish
the
bottle
however
im
moving
on
tonight
and
my
adventure
ends
with
this
one
its
moerlein
otr
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
d
this
could
be
a
daily
drinker
for
me
just
the
thought
of
a
wild
pumpkin
ale
gets
me
going
the
growler
had
hung
around
for
a
while
which
is
why
the
carbonation
was
not
there
but
i
still
found
it
very
drinkable
d
daily
drinker
which
is
impressive
because
it
is
wild
and
pumpkin
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
some
of
this
at
capones
matt
mentioned
that
hed
had
trouble
with
the
keg
but
it
was
pouring
fine
during
my
visit
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
yet
solid
cap
of
fine
beige
bubbles
thick
sticky
lacing
interesting
aroma
sort
of
expected
from
jp
smells
tart
with
a
bit
of
strawberry
and
yeasty
spices
a
bit
grassy
lemon
with
light
vinegar
notes
really
nice
flavour
solid
tartness
a
bit
acetic
but
well
balanced
rather
than
bold
there
was
a
bit
of
vegetal
sweetness
squash
or
pumpkin
flesh
with
herbal
bitterness
in
the
finish
light
earthiness
and
funk
citrus
zest
lingering
spice
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
a
bit
on
the
creamy
side
and
a
little
slick
this
was
really
cool
a
completely
different
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
check
this
out
if
you
get
a
chance
hedonistically
i
enjoyed
my
glass
and
id
have
had
another
and
almost
did
forget
about
the
whole
pumpkin
thing
and
enjoy
overall
not
bad
but
flavors
are
weak
slight
touch
of
tart
tanginess
make
it
enjoyable
very
easy
to
gulp
down
but
dont
seek
this
out
i
heard
many
mixed
reviews
on
this
while
it
was
on
tap
most
disliked
it
but
i
found
it
interesting
with
the
standout
brettfilled
funkiness
that
i
was
hoping
for
if
anyone
expected
to
have
a
pumpkin
beer
they
were
probably
let
down
drinkability
is
good
probably
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
or
two
but
the
lack
of
pumpkin
would
keep
me
from
plopping
down
another
7
50
on
this
one
not
bad
just
not
as
good
as
i
thought
it
would
be
sits
a
hazy
copper
orange
with
a
small
offwhite
head
nose
of
sourish
tart
fruit
some
cookie
dough
and
maybe
a
smidgen
of
grass
and
spice
not
much
pumpkin
spice
though
toasted
malts
and
tart
brett
funk
start
out
the
palate
light
caramel
and
cookie
malt
fillin
midway
with
buttery
pecan
pie
accents
near
the
finish
hints
of
spices
linger
in
the
finish
with
residual
tart
wildness
mediumbodied
with
soft
light
carbonation
good
drinkability
probably
the
subtlest
pumpkin
ale
i
have
ever
had
probably
the
only
sour
one
as
well
works
for
me
since
im
not
crazy
about
overlyspiced
beers
anyways
wow
this
was
really
interesting
and
seemed
to
me
that
jolly
pumpkin
pretty
much
pulled
off
what
they
were
shooting
for
with
this
a
pumpkin
ale
that
is
rich
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
spice
but
possessing
their
trademark
wild
quality
i
liked
that
the
tartness
didnt
quite
dominate
the
taste
as
much
as
it
did
the
nose
allowing
much
more
of
the
pumpkin
qualities
to
shine
through
a
unique
beer
for
sure
that
im
glad
to
have
been
able
to
try
not
bad
but
not
great
not
as
much
flavor
as
u
would
expect
i
love
pumpkin
beers
and
this
one
is
not
that
great
its
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
overall
this
is
a
decent
pumpkin
beer
but
its
not
great
either
im
not
putting
in
on
my
list
of
pumpkin
beers
to
get
next
year
but
if
it
was
offered
id
certainly
not
turn
it
down
either
great
choice
if
your
looking
for
a
pumpkin
with
less
abv
and
not
an
overwhelming
pumpkin
taste
pumpkin
as
pumpkin
does
an
this
one
does
well
an
i
have
tried
them
all
well
all
that
i
can
get
in
these
parts
i
like
it
one
of
the
better
albeit
thin
pumpkin
ales
around
this
one
has
a
nicer
pumpkin
cream
flavor
to
it
without
being
a
spice
bomb
saranacs
is
a
pumpkin
ale
perfectly
suited
to
those
who
drink
the
trends
but
maybe
arent
so
sure
how
they
feel
about
the
style
in
general
its
exceptionally
mild
and
minimal
even
as
far
as
entrylevel
versions
go
almost
as
if
it
were
designed
for
childrens
consumption
theres
such
an
anemic
amount
of
grain
and
spices
youd
think
the
brewery
was
under
wartime
rations
more
trick
than
treat
awesome
pumpkin
overall
my
impression
of
saranac
pumpkin
ale
is
quite
favorable
and
it
might
even
be
the
second
biggest
pleasant
surprise
of
the
season
the
first
being
the
much
maligned
wolavers
organic
pumpkin
ale
earning
the
gold
medal
at
the
2014
gabf
amongst
52
competing
entries
despite
the
dismal
ratings
here
on
ba
lots
of
great
pumpkin
ales
out
there
that
dont
even
make
it
into
the
80s
for
ratings
add
saranac
to
the
list
really
weak
pumpkin
taste
soso
beer
can
really
taste
the
pumpkin
in
this
its
a
good
thing
o
this
is
not
a
good
pumpkin
beer
because
its
not
a
good
base
beer
adding
pumpkin
flavor
to
a
bad
beer
just
creates
a
bad
pumpkin
beer
ive
not
had
any
other
offerings
from
saranac
but
i
think
these
folks
would
be
better
off
not
brewing
a
pumpkin
beer
overall
a
great
cheap
buy
great
for
entertaining
but
not
to
wow
decent
brew
great
growler
and
decent
seasonal
serving
type
bottle
it
comes
in
a
32
oz
jug
how
cool
is
that
i
really
thought
it
would
be
awful
but
its
actually
pretty
good
for
your
standard
dusty
pie
spiced
fall
seasonal
great
pumpkin
beer
you
dont
get
over
power
like
other
type
so
f
pumpkins
nice
clover
smell
to
it
very
smooth
and
clean
going
down
one
of
those
run
of
the
mill
pumpkin
beers
you
can
find
it
in
most
places
in
the
east
coast
but
that
doesnt
mean
you
would
put
start
fantasy
pumpkin
beer
roster
its
more
of
a
third
tier
flex
option
if
you
had
to
drink
it
because
your
main
beers
werent
refrigerated
its
a
dark
brown
hoppy
at
the
start
and
finish
not
much
lacing
but
spices
are
present
throughout
without
the
sweetness
drink
it
of
its
on
special
and
if
you
need
a
6
pack
for
under
10
maybe
grab
it
otherwise
steer

not

of

of

beers
from
this
company
there
are

better

on
the
market
for
the
money
pass

this
in

love

better
than
i

credit
for
appearance
is
a
dark

with
a

head
that
fizzes
away
quickly
the
smell
is
pumpkin
although
a
little
subtle
with
allspice
and
nutmeg
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
more
spice
than
pumpkin
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
me
but
for
the
price
i
thought
it
was
a
very
nice
value
for
what
it
is
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
deep
roasted
malts
and
spices
but
it
fails
as
a
pumpkin
ale
if
you
make
a
pumpkin
ale
pumpkin
should
be
at
the
top
of
your
list
of
ingredients
still
it
is
not
a
complete
loss
good
beer
nose
has
the
cinnamon
and
spices
that
are
usually
present
with
a
pumpkin
ale
color
is
very
nice
clear

yellow

the
spices
are

and
outdo
the

the
beer
is
rather

and
the

is
fantastic
overall
pretty
average
but
glad
to
be
getting
back
into
the
season
and
looking

to
some
other
offerings
i
think
this
would
be
good
to
have
at
a
party
where
everyones
not
going
to
be
real
picky
and
thisd
probably
be
a
good
choice
for
a
pumpkin
keg
its
refreshing
and
probably
really
palatable
for
a

it
wasnt

im

by
the

vs
quality
of
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
to
anyone
it
or
buy
it
again
had
some
good
quality
pumpkin
beers
this
year
this
one
might
be
the
worst
or
second
to
worst
battling
with
pumpkick
from
new
belgium
i
was
excited
to
try
this
selection
for
the
halloween
season
i
was
very
disappointed
i
poured
bottle
into
a
glass
i
could
not
taste
pumpkin
or
any
other
spices
at
all
it
was
as
if
i
were
drinking
a
bad
rolling
rock
would
not
recommend
this
to
my
friends
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
amberorange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
smell
is
an
absolutely
amazing
combination
of
pumpkin
and
ginger
taste
is
a
good
combination
of
fall
spices
i
can
taste
the
cinnamon
and
ginger
spices
coming
through
had
nice
balance
though
spices
are
not
overpowering
not
sweet
or
bitter
nice
balance
mediumlight
bodied
the
aftertaste
is
where
the
pumpkin
flavor
kicks
in
great
beer
for
halloween
night
o
this
is
my
second
pumpkin
ale
i
enjoyed
it
plus
i
liked
the
32oz
jug
it
came
in
i
probably
wont
get
this
agin
but
only
because
there
are
so
many
pumpkin
beers
and
so
little
time
i
recommend
trying
this
this
pumpkin
ale
is
ok
i
went
on
a
little
pumpkin
ale
shopping
spree
and
picked
up
several
i
chose
to
drink
this
one
first
cause
it
was
a
huge
32oz
bottle
the
color
is
nice
a
slightly
dark
amber
the
smell
has
just
a
touch
of
pumpkin
spice
the
taste
too
has
just
a
touch
of
spices
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
pumpkin
beer
for
someone
just
beginning
to
cross
the
bridge
from
mainstream
light
beer
into
the
craft
beer
world
glad
i
didnt
spend
anything
on
this
one
as
it
was
a
gift
from
tupacksumore
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
it
washes
down
rather
quickly
and
easily
and
leaves
very
little
residue
finishes
slightly
dry
good
utility
pumpkin
ale
for
a
beer
to
have
on
a
regular
basis
during
the
fall
and
for
your
less
beer
advocate
guests
this
is
a
great
pick
o
a
solid
pumkpkin
ale
they
arent
really
my
style
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
representation
not
overly
sweet
but
slightly
sweet
like
a
pumpkin
ale
should
be
this
is
a
fall
beer
and
for
what
it
is
its
pretty
good
not
outstanding
but
again
a
good
fall
beer
that
could
be
greatly
enjoyed
in
a
lateseason
round
of
golf
overall
i
was
of
course
disappointed
as
most
saranac
beers
are
always
enjoyable
i
will
look
to
trying
this
again
and
revisit
this
beer
next
season
overall
it
was
very
disappointing
i
had
this
beer
last
year
and
remember
looking
forward
to
it
this
year
especially
after
having
saranacs
shandy
this
summer
this
is
an
okay
brew
the
smell
is
decent
enough
almost
like
a
spice
nut
bread
however
the
taste
is
quite
watery
and
has
a
skunky
aftertaste
the
most
redeemable
quality
was
that
it
came
in
a
very
nice
oldstyle
quart
jug
that
was
worth
it
ill
still
get
it
again
next
year
though
i
wouldnt
if
it
was
yearround
would
likely
work
fine
to
quaff
a
few
on
a
nice
fall
day
decent
to
try
with
a
newbie
getting
into
better
beer
but
there
are
plenty
of
better
pumpkin
beers
out
there
tastes
light
and
spicy
its
not
fullbodied
but
close
a
little
too
loosely
constituted
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
theres
too
much
cinnamon
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
smells
like
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
which
is
okay
but
its
somewhat
artificial
overall
its
not
bad
but
theres
much
better
out
there
o
better
than
i
thought
would
drink
again
o
overall
its
an
alright
pumpkin
beer
in
a
pinch
but
it
just
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
or
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
i
think
pumkpin
ales
like
any
other
beer
that
employs
a
nontraditionalist
style
comes
with
some
caveats
like
any
beer
that
comes
with
a
sweet
taste
or
a
spicy
taste
assumes
only
a
few
can
be
consumed
before
you
sense
of
taste
is
overwhelmed
and
you
need
to
switch
i
think
that
holds
true
for
the
pumpkins
but
of
the
pumpkins
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
along
with
smuttynose
and
long
trail
i
think
these
are
best
you
can
get
its
relatively
smooth
great
smell
good
taste
great
for
a
pumpkin
and
has
some
flexiblity
what
i
mean
is
a
great
mix
drink
to
make
with
this
beer
is
the
traditional
autumn
drink
of
makers
mark
saranac
pumpkin
and
warm
apple
cider
try
it
you
will
thank
me
overall
has
a
nice
relaxed
pumpkin
spice
flavor
easy
to
kick
back
a
couple
in
a
row
perfect
for
the
season
overall
not
very
good
in
my
book
would
not
get
again
overall
not
good
as
a
pumpkin
beer
but
not
bad
if
you
consider
this
a
lager
overall
really
disappointed
by
this
beer
a
bit
darker
than
expected
smell
was
exactly
what
id
expect
but
nothing
spectacular
tastewise
this
beer
just
doesnt
cut
it
at
all
mouthfeel
just
confirms
the
taste
being
sub
par
light
copper
amber
color
with
decent
head
and
moderate
carbonation
clove
vanilla
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
especially
pumpkin
notes
in
the
aroma
the
notes
in
the
aroma
are
reflected
in
the
taste
very
balanced
not
heavy
or
too
light
the
very
many
flavor
notes
arent
overpowered
by
the
malt
hops
or
alcohol
this
year
is
our
favorite
brew
of
this
beer
yet
finishes
with
more
flavor
and
less
alcohol
cheers
o
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pumpkin
ales
out
there
i
really
enjoy
the
drinkability
and
the
tasty
blend
of
fall
spices
this
too
is
a
nice
change
up
from
the
overly
sweet
high
alcohol
pumpkin
ales
the
body
finishes
much
too
dry
to
carry
the
spices
lacks
depth
of
flavor
and
complexity
as
the
spices
are
the
primary
characteristic
of
this
light
fizzy
brew
overall
very
different
and
really
quite
nice
not
sure
id
have
one
too
often
but
for
a
change
it
is
quite
good
particularly
good
since
i
picked
it
up
for
8
a
6pack
since
it
was
a
failed
halloween
special
at
the
local
mwahahaha
nice
moderate
carbonation
as
body
the
classic
pumpkin
beer
to
me
in
upstate
new
york
this
beer
signals
that
the
season
is
here
a
pours
of
rich
coppery
orange
nearly
red
in
color
with
a
just
off
white
lacey
head
the
nose
is
the
perfect
mix
of
pumpkin
and
spice
some
clove
vanilla
cannamon
and
allspice
flavor
starts
off
with
mellow
spice
and
a
lot
of
the
pumpkin
pie
flavors
but
not
too
much
sugar
it
moves
to
an
english
malty
fruit
bread
sort
of
middle
and
a
nice
heavier
sweeter
spice
in
the
finish
this
is
the
pumpkin
beer
i
grew
up
on
and
for
that
i
will
always
love
it
never
too
sweet
never
too
spicy
just
balanced
lighter
mouthfeel
for
what
it
is
and
just
right
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
very
sessionable
pumpkin
brew
and
definitely
on
of
the
better
ones
on
offer
anywhere
i
think
it
is
grossly
underrated
here
on
ba
food
match
apart
from
the
obvious
pumpkin
pie
this
brew
would
also
suit
festive
foods
like
roast
turkey
with
cranberry
sauce
yams
roasted
sweet
potatoes
stuffing
sweet
corn
and
squash
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
pumpkin
beer
made
for
the
masses
the
aroma
is
very
good
the
flavor
on
the
other
hand
has
some
misses
its
not
bad
but
its
not
great
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
o
glad
to
see
some
pumpkin
beers
land
in
oz
ive
only
had
one
other
pumpkin
to
compair
this
to
gage
roads
but
this
beer
seemed
to
lack
any
trace
of
the
core
ingredent
pumpkin
but
to
be
fair
its
not
bad
it
finishs
clean
with
a
nice
yeastyness
if
only
i
could
get
other
pumpkin
beers
here
overall
i
actually
like
this
beer
i
dont
love
it
but
it
may
be
one
of
saranacs
best
im
sure
there
is
no
pumpkin
in
here
but
this
hits
the
mark
on
several
of
the
attributes
i
look
for
in
a
pumpkin
beer
overall
this
barely
deserves
to
be
called
a
pumpkin
ale
there
is
hardly
any
spice
it
is
more
like
an
amber
with
a
ton
of
off
flavors
the
tartness
is
bad
and
it
is
really
just
very
muddled
not
worth
the
time
seeking
out
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
clear
copperamber
coloring
that
is
bright
and
vibrant
with
a
sparse
touch
of
offwhite
film
on
the
surface
aromas
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
a
smooth
malty
sweet
backbone
well
balanced
nose
flavors
are
rich
and
spicy
with
a
smooth
and
sweet
pumpkin
backbone
supporting
the
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
other
harvest
spices
that
blend
and
highlight
the
brew
roasty
and
earthy
tones
make
this
beer
a
touch
more
dynamic
on
the
palate
roasty
richly
sweet
aftertaste
leading
to
a
smooth
slightly
spiced
finish
that
is
clean
and
sharp
the
body
is
a
bit
light
for
all
of
the
flavors
but
the
beer
is
decent
overall
tasty
seasonal
brew
mouthferl
is
a
bit
light
and
watery
medium
bodied
smooth
and
medium
carbonation
i
am
overall
pleasantly
happy
with
this
even
though
it
does
not
compare
with
others
the
generic
flavors
of
most
pumpkin
beers
dont
kill
you
on
this
one
when
i
poured
thsi
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
nice
light
copper
color
body
with
a
nice
couple
of
inches
light
tan
color
foamy
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
good
while
the
smell
is
of
clove
and
cinnamon
the
taste
has
the
spices
but
doesnt
have
any
pumpkin
flavor
to
it
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
weak
for
me
and
overall
im
not
impressed
and
i
think
it
is
ok
but
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
theres
something
different
from
the
first
sip
a
bitterness
not
typically
found
in
pumpkin
ales
the
pumpkin
flavor
seems
a
little
watered
down
theres
spices
in
there
but
they
dont
seem
to
work
too
well
together
at
least
it
does
have
a
distinct
taste
overall
its
a
good
beer
just
not
a
great
pumpkin
ale
overall
this
is
a
decently
good
pumpkin
ale
here
i
wish
the
pumpkin
flavor
was
more
noticeable
but
the
spices
made
up
for
its
limited
presence
not
bad
to
find
on
draft
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
yearly
o
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
were
offputting
to
me
the
beer
was
nothing
special
to
look
at
and
the
taste
was
only
mildly
worth
it
ive
had
much
better
pumpkin
ales
overall
an
alright
pumpkin
brew
it
is
on
the
slightly
drier
side
with
an
easy
drinking
flavor
profile
o
decent
pumpkin
brew
good
flavors
and
aromas
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
beer
but
worth
a
try
o
better
than
what
i
remember
it
being
when
i
first
tried
it
a
few
years
ago
o
this
one
keeps
a
creamy
layer
of
head
throughout
the
drink
but
nothing
stands
out
in
terms
of
taste
cant
really
pick
out
any
real
pumpkin
flavor
still
worth
trying
taste
is
malty
with
tons
of
spicing
seems
very
similar
to
most
of
the
pumpkin
beers
available
with
nothing
to
distinguish
it
from
the
pack
body
is
decent
with
a
soft
but
active
carbonation
lightly
toasted
caramely
malt
notes
up
front
vegetal
gourdy
flavor
moves
in
but
is
tempered
by
sweetish
pie
filling
and
sugary
crust
notes
nutmeg
and
clove
finish
off
the
palate
lingering
caramel
and
cooked
vegetables
moderate
body
with
a
slightly
fizzy
feel
not
bad
overall
good
beer
for
four
dollars
it
might
be
a
great
friend
keep
the
bottle
it
comes
in
and
you
have
half
a
growler
seriously
i
had
it
after
a
long
day
of
painting
and
just
hit
the
spot
salud
o
a
subtle
pumpkin
ale
that
is
a
change
of
pace
from
the
spiceforward
fall
beers
overall
pretty
good
o
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
light
flavors
of
pumpkin
and
spices
but
does
not
stand
out
to
me
surprisingly
though
for
the
very
cheap
price
the
beers
not
that
bad
nose
of
pumpkins
and
faint
allspice
light
mouthfeel
with
brisk
carbonation
the
taste
of
cheap
adjuncts
up
front
followed
by
some
genuine
pumpkin
flavor
and
light
spices
cinnamon
and
allspice
semisweet
with
pretty
decent
balance
all
in
all
one
of
the
few
decent
saranac
brews
out
there
its
nowhere
near
as
good
as
most
pumpkin
beers
ought
to
be
but
does
give
some
of
the
pricier
lighter
pumpkin
brews
such
as
brooklyns
and
sam
adams
a
run
for
their
money
o
well
i
was
kinda
beginning
to
worry
as
i
purchased
the
fall
variety
pack
and
was
getting
through
these
beers
as
i
wasnt
too
into
any
of
these
other
than
what
ive
already
had
from
previous
purchases
however
this
one
is
way
better
than
some
of
the
others
in
the
saranac
autumn
pack
this
is
a
good
pumpkin
that
i
would
come
back
to
everything
is
combined
right
solid
for
a
pumpkin
o
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
as
being
impressive
about
the
smell
or
taste
of
this
beer
but
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
this
might
make
for
a
good
pumpkin
beer
to
try
for
someone
who
is
just
getting
into
craft
beers
and
might
get
turned
off
by
stronger
flavors
of
pumpkin
or
spices
o
im
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
as
i
came
into
it
with
the
expectation
that
it
would
at
least
be
better
than
average
compared
to
some
of
the
other
beers
i
have
tried
i
do
actually
get
a
bit
of
pumpkin
in
the
aftertaste
but
the
balance
of
spices
is
not
there
the
beer
isnt
bad
and
i
could
drink
a
couple
without
much
problem
but
for
a
go
to
pumpkin
ale
i
will
need
to
go
elsewhere
dark
amber
orange
color
mild
spice
aroma
and
nice
head
excellent
balanced
smooth
flavor
with
plenty
of
real
pumpkin
flavor
and
malt
lightly
spiced
with
pleasant
aftertaste
of
mostly
pumpkin
an
easy
drinking
low
abv
pumpkin
that
is
consistent
every
year
o
a
rather
lackluster
pumpkin
ale
overall
barely
any
of
the
spices
that
remind
you
of
pumpkin
pie
not
even
any
malt
or
hop
profile
just
a
light
pumpkin
not
bad
just
not
memorable
i
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
nice
foamy
head
and
a
fantastic
aroma
some
may
dislike
the
fact
that
the
pumpkin
and
spice
flavor
is
minimized
compared
to
other
beers
whereas
i
actually
prefer
it
it
is
extremely
drinkable
which
the
plethora
of
empty
bottles
on
my
stoop
can
attest
for
ill
probably
be
buying
another
case
very
soon
before
the
season
is
out
by
no
means
my
absolute
favorite
beer
but
for
the
price
and
the
taste
its
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
going
give
it
a
try
absolutely
hands
down
my
favorite
seasonal
no
questions
or
debates
rich
amber
color
a
bit
of
haze
and
a
nice
foam
smell
the
pumpkin
the
pumpkin
is
quite
pronounced
in
this
ale
the
spices
play
a
secondary
role
to
the
pumpkin
malts
hops
all
come
secondary
to
the
pumpkin
the
taste
wow
sweet
smoothe
a
bit
thick
creamy
did
i
mention
pumpkin
i
could
go
on
and
on
about
this
beer
but
you
need
to
try
it
if
you
are
remotely
interested
in
autumnstyle
beer
its
not
for
everybody
i
will
say
that
but
to
those
who
it
is
for
you
wont
want
the
season
to
end
overall
a
decent
enough
pumpkin
beer
worth
a
try
o
its
kind
of
plain
not
much
there
for
what
i
want
out
of
a
pumpkin
overall
though
they
advertise
a
pumpkin
ale
you
get
a
pumpkin
ale
with
this
just
a
little
depressed
with
the
spicing
to
pumpkin
ratio
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
into
pilsner
glass
fine
offwhite
head
very
light
scent
of
pumpkin
and
spices
present
again
wish
there
were
a
bit
more
tastes
similar
to
others
of
the
saranac
brand
theres
a
slight
bit
of
pumpkin
and
spices
in
the
back
not
as
much
as
id
like
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
fairly
light
mild
carbonation
this
beer
is
definitely
more
drinkable
than
its
counterparts
in
volume
but
i
would
prefer
the
alternative
o
good
drinkability
and
a
nice
flavor
profile
but
low
on
the
pumpkin
that
im
looking
for
although
it
was
too
spicy
for
me
this
beer
comes
with
my
usual
comments
about
saranac
namely
that
its
not
too
bad
for
the
price
o
i
was
expecting
more
from
a
pumpkin
ale
the
style
is
hard
to
find
in
my
area
and
when
i
do
find
them
they
seem
to
disappoint
this
is
a
decent
brew
and
worth
a
try
i
was
just
wanting
more
pumpkin
flavor
than
what
this
brought
i
do
love
the
pumpkin
ale
style
o
slightly
above
average
pumpkin
ale
but
a
bit
too
watery
i
would
not
recommend
it
o
this
beer
is
a
bit
sweet
for
my
tastes
which
hurts
drinkability
but
otherwise
its
an
ok
light
pumpkin
beer
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
it
it
smells
nice
but
is
otherwise
fairly
bland
without
being
too
offensive
overall
decent
pumpkin
ale
good
balance
of
spice
and
malt
unlike
other
pumpkin
ales
where
i
feel
like
im
drinking
eggnog
or
pumpkin
cyder
overall
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
it
gives
you
anise
pumpkin
pie
experience
without
going
overboard
with
the
pumpkin
or
sweetness
needs
a
little
more
body
and
it
would
be
a
much
better
beer
overall
saranac
is
on
to
something
with
this
combo
of
flavors
unfortunately
this
could
be
better
crafted
pump
up
the
mouth
feel
and
give
the
flavor
profiles
a
boost
o
overall
not
a
very
bad
pumpkin
ale
good
abv
and
nice
flavors
makes
this
on
pretty
good
worth
looking
for
in
october
o
well
this
beer
varied
with
each
sip
it
was
really
inconsistent
my
first
sip
was
very
unpleasently
bitter
not
in
the
good
way
as
if
there
was
some
burnt
flavor
going
on
in
it
on
the
otherhand
as
the
drink
progressed
the
sweet
roasted
pumpkin
worked
its
way
to
the
forefront
so
this
was
just
ehh
great
aromas
though
sort
of
middle
of
the
road
its
not
bad
but
its
too
impressive
either
another
generic
entry
to
this
category
lacking
any
particular
trait
that
would
make
it
stand
out
its
not
too
heavy
handed
with
the
spice
rack
but
that
is
the
predominant
flavor
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
great
fall
style
taste
and
something
i
would
like
to
have
again
poured
light
brown
with
an
orange
hue
there
was
no
appreciable
head
to
speak
of
but
the
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
aroma
was
a
nice
touch
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
muted
pumpkin
flavor
there
was
also
some
pie
spice
present
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
not
as
adventurous
as
some
of
the
imperials
of
this
style
however
this
is
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
to
enjoy
on
a
cool
fall
day
overall
interesting
beer
to
try
in
the
efforts
of
seeking
the
penultimate
pumpkin
beer
but
id
call
this
a
fall
harvest
rather
than
a
true
pumpkin
ale
not
half
bad
perhaps
not
at
beery
as
i
was
hoping
for
the
spice
does
not
get
annoying
at
all
and
there
is
enough
malt
flavor
to
keep
things
interesting
pours
a
orangish
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
head
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
cinnomon
nutmeg
there
is
not
a
pumpkin
presence
here
that
i
can
really
find
the
taste
has
a
caramel
malt
start
with
brown
sugar
also
the
middle
has
a
faint
pumpkin
and
cinnomon
taste
there
is
a
slight
metallic
tang
at
the
very
end
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
was
an
okay
pumpkin
beer
it
was
more
rounded
than
what
i
expected
it
seemed
like
the
pumpkin
taste
was
subdued
and
missing
from
the
aroma
moreys
bottom
line
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
smooth
and
not
overly
spiced
a
good
beer
but
there
are
other
pumpkin
ales
that
are
superior
to
this
one
imo
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
creamy
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
film
there
is
virtually
no
lacing
whatsoever
the
mouth
feel
is
watery
and
carbonated
very
much
in
the
same
vein
as
a
typical
massproduced
adjunct
lager
the
taste
is
underwhelming
nothing
really
stands
out
yes
obviously
there
are
typical
spice

nutmeg
clove
allspice
pumpkin
spice
overall
this
beer
is
not
terrible
ive
had
worse
this
year
but
nothing
stands
out
it
tastes
like
a
lot
of
other
mediocre
pumpkin
ales
this
year
i
would
recommend
trying
one
bottle
of
this
if
youre
going
to
buy
several
other
pumpkin
ales
but
a
6
pack
of
this
is
too
much
of
a
beentheredonethat
pumpkin
ale
experience
not
sure
what
i
expected
when
i
purchased
this
but
i
think
overall
its
a
nice
drinking
pumpkin
beer
with
not
a
lot
of
kick
or
spice
like
others
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
chilly
fall
day
while
watching
football
does
have
a
nice
smell
and
color
to
it
but
does
lack
the
real
pumpkin
pie
taste
in
my
opinion
nonetheless
good
beer
and
not
too
expensive
either
for
saranac
this
is
good
its
a
little
heavy
on
the
carbonation
and
the
overall
flavor
profile
is
thin
and
mild
but
with
all
around
balance
this
was
a
very
pleasant
pumpkin
ale
that
didnt
go
overboard
with
the
spices
i
also
found
it
nice
that
there
wasnt
an
artificial
pumpkin
flavor
that
so
many
pumpkin
ales
seem
to
have
nothing
spectacular
but
a
solid
brew
nonetheless

an

offering
but
didnt
have
enough
in
terms
of
body
for
my
liking
approximates
but
never
fully
achieves
the
pumpkin
pie
offering
really
only
crust
and
spiced
notes
o
pretty
middle
of
the
road
for
me
not
bad
nothing
special
the
cinnamon
was
too
strong
here
for
me
d
an
average
pumpkin
beer
its
mostly
just
holiday
spices
and
bread
however
not
horrible
by
any
means
but
not
impressive
either
it
has
decent
drinkability
but
overall
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
ok
this
is
a
amber
colored
beer
the
smell
is
very
strong
in
cinnamon
smell
as
for
taste
this
is
very
strong
with
cloves
to
strong
it
takes
over
the
beer
mouth
is
ok
and
acceptable
over
all
we
feel
the
spices
take
away
from
this
beer
overall
nice
beer
with
out
the
spice
but
then
again
with
out
the
spice
it
would
not
be
a
pumpkin
ale
with
out
the
spice
enjoy
if
it
is
your
type
of
beer
pours
the
same
brown
shade
as
its
bottle
small
white
froth
i
cant
bring
myself
to
call
a
head
that
dies
off
almost
instantlyno

smells
malty
not
pumpkin
or
spice
the
taste
is
ok
but
dissapointing
on
the

a
bit

poured
into
my
newcastle
geordie
schooner
copper
amber
color
with
thin
head
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
was
pumpkin
pie
spice
and
a
tiny
bit
of
pumpkin
taste
was
mostly
malt
a
tiny
bit
of
spice
and
even
less
pumpkin
in
general
a
nice
basic
ale
with
a
bit
of
spice
easy
drinking
and
not
too
complicated
clear
and
copper
a
lot
of
carbonation
on
this
one
the
cap
popped
off
with
a
lot
of
force
small
amount
of
thin
big
bubbles
that
were
gone
as
fast
as
the
appeared
thin
nose
small
notes
of
sweet
bread
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
pie
the
pumpkin
pops
out
more
in
the
flavor
the
malt
body
is
light
and
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
pungent
pumpkin
spice
that
leaves
a
sharp
note
on
your
palette
dry
with
a
carbonation
bite
for
the
finish
so
many
pumpkins
out
there
my
money
is
better
spent
elsewhere
oi
think
the
first
review
benefited
from
first
pumpkin
ale
of
the
season
syndrome
the
saranac
was
easily
the
worst
of
the
nine
beer
line
up
drinkability
i
actually
enjoyed
this
beer
and
usually
saranac
products
are
sometimes
boring
with
the
exception
of
some
of
the
rarer
stuff
yet
this
pumpkin
beer
is
different
its
got
nice
spice
notes
that
arent
over
the
top
its
drinkable
and
its
cheap
my
only
gripe
is
the
overuse
of
vanilla
in
the
actual
flavor
here
in
the
aroma
its
very
satisfying
yet
when
i
taste
more
vanilla
over
taste
of
pumpkin
andor
spice
it
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
yet
overall
a
well
crafted
pumpkin
beer
i
will
seek
again
throughout
the
fall
months
for
at
least
a
few
sips
this
could
substitute
for
a
pumpkin
pie
just
a
kiss
of
hops
and
caramel
malts
that
remind
you
that
its
beer
cinnamon
and
allspice
play
off
each
other
nicely
and
pumpkin
rounds
out
all
the
flavors
in
a
nice
albeit
subtle
way
after
a
few
sips
though
the
pumpkin
and
spices
start
blending
together
into
not
much
else
than
a
malt
forward
beer
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
spices
on
the
front
side
the
pumpkin
and
pleasant
spices
definitely
lose
their
punch
as
your
palate
assimilates
to
them
making
for
a
somewhat
dissapointing
amount
of
flavor
a
light
body
and
easy
finish
dont
accomplish
much
for
the
style
still
there
is
some
really
nice
flavor
to
behold
and
while
this
may
not
be
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
this
year
it
still
has
some
things
going
for
it
overall
my
second
pumpkin
beer
and
this
one
was
very
nice
enjoyable
for
a
cool
fall
day
o
this
was
just
another
average
pumpkin
ale
for
me
the
pumpkin
stood
out
more
than
the
spices
but
it
did
have
a
nice
malt
bill
o
great
witches
brew
with
a
lot
of
soul
hey
sam
adams
this
is
what
these
beers
are

taste

no

spices
nice

just

i
knew
that

it

definitely
more
of

it

by

i
just
prefer
something
that
has

basically
your

pumpkin

smells
like
pumpkin
pie
taste
isnt
very
pumpkin
like
in
fact
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
lot
of
pumpkin
it
seems
more
like
an
american
wheat
with
cinnamon
pumpkin
flavor
comes
out
to
play
a
lot
more
in
the
taste
its
pretty
nice
and
one
of
the
more
pumpkiny
beers
i
have
had
spices
are
not
as
heavy
as
i
had
feared
upon
sniffing
but
there
is
quite
a
bittering
finish
from
a
hopspice
combo
sweetness
is
low
and
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side
making
this
a
highly
attenuated
beer
dry
and
finishes
relatively
clean
a
pretty
decent
pumpkin
beer
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
heavy
handed
with
the
spices
i
thought
this
was
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
offerings
i
can
detect
the
pumpkin
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
the
spice
cant
really
taste
pumpkin
spice
is
more
predominant
allspice
seems
to
be
the
dominant
spice
here
with
some
cloves
the
pumpkin
spice
is
not
overpowering
and
is
very
drinkable
starts
with
a
big

goes
to
a

quickly
ok

some

some

taste
is
malty
and
sugary
sweet
with
some
nice
autumn
seasonings
smooth
to
drink
and
refreshing
not
the
most
memorable
pumpkin
beer
ever
but
a
worthwhile
and
tasty
offering
the
beer
has
a
beautiful
color
like
a
copper
penny
there
is
a
bright
white

of
small
bubbles
that
was

to
dissipate
the

and
clove
it
smells
like
the
spices
you
would
put
into
a
pumpkin
pie
at
first
there
isnt
much
pumpkin
flavor
but
as
the
beer
sits
in
your
mouth
you
begin
to
taste
the
spices
more
so
than
an
actual
pumpkin
flavor
there
is
some
sweetness
to
the
flavor
but
it
is
a
darker
sweetness
reminiscent
of
molasses
it
has
a
bit
of
a
thinner
body
than
i
expected
it
is
well

not
the

there
are
many
other
beers
in

with

this
one
that
bigs
up
the
beer
hugely
which
then
fails
to
deliver

s
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
either
im
all
for
trying
different
seasonal
beers
that
have
a
distinctive

this
one
kind
of
blends
in
a

its
a

with
mulling

being

goes

with
a

it
doesnt

a

not

only
like
many
pumpkin

and
theres
enough
other
things
going

to
keep
it

for

a

with
a

completely
with
no

cinnamon

i
think
i
can
smell
the
pumpkin
itself
as
well
the
flavor
is
less
full
than
the
aroma
some
malt
character
comes
through
i
havent
had
very
many
pumpkin
beers
but
this
one
seems
fairly
weak
d
a
buddy
and
i
have
been
picking
up
as
many
pumpkin
beers
as
we
can
and
i
think
this
is
the
best
so
far
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
although
there
isnt
too
much
pumpkin
flavor
in
this
just
some
pumpkin
pie
spice
i
will
not
buy
this
one
again
i
have
tried
a
few
other
pumpkin
ales
i
like
the
style
just
not
this
one
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
standard
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
clear
copper
color
with
about
a
finger
of
fluffy
light
rust
colored
foam
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
nutmeg
cinnamon
caramel
toasted
bread
some
clove
and
im
even
getting
a
faint
hint
of
roast
pumpkin
body
is
a
bit
thin
with
decent
carbonation
levels
not
the
worst
pumpkin
ale
out
there
cant
argue
over
the
price
either
drinkability
i
havent
consumed
numbers
of
these
backtoback
but
it
would
be
easy
to
do
i
wouldnt
want
an
entire
evening
of
these
but
putting
back
a
few
in
a
row
would
be
no
problem
for
me
not
my
type
of
beer
but
ok
d
good
its
low
enough
in

and
a
pleasant
enough
taste
to
have
a
few
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
out
there
but
a
decent
one
that
is
fairly
well
balanced
strongest
spice
that
stood
out
to
me
was
the
cinnamon
with
some
nutmeg
in
the
mix
nice
malt
flavor
but
could
improve
with
an
increase
in
the
body
of
the
beer
id
drink
it
again
but
at
the
pricepoint
im
considering
checking
out
the
michelob
jacks
offering
for
comparison
cheers
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
ruby
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
light
pumpkin
with
notes
of
cinnamon
and
cloves
more
perceptible
then
i
had
expected
taste
is
also
dominated
by
cloves
and
cinnamon
which
are
well
balanced
with
pumpkin
and
light
caramel
malt
body
is
a
bit
light
for
my
own
taste
with
good
carbonation
some
additional
character
and
more
body
would
have
greatly
benefited
this
beer
which
is
still
very
enjoyable
dvery
drinkable
overall
i
think
post
road
is
a
better
beer
but
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
one
reviewer
once
wrote
that
saranac
beers
are
like
comfort
food
i
agree
entirely
are
they
the
best
no
do
they
satisfy
the
average
beer
thirst
absolutely
drinks
pretty
good
solid
pumpkin
flavors
all
meld
well
this
beer
is
worthy
of
a
session
this
brew
is
a
good
solid
pumkin
ale
the
ale
is
not
overshadowed
by
the
spices
in
this
one
which
makes
it
very
drinkable
a
great
way
to
kick
start
the
fall
season
a
nice
effort
by
saranac
this
is
an
exceptional
fall
beer
probably
the
one
i
look
forward
to
the
most
in
my
opinion
it
is
the
best
of
all
pumpkinrelated
beers
which
is
strange
bc
its
probably
one
of
the
cheapest
it
has
just
the
right
balance
of
beer
and
pumpkin
taste
and
doesnt
have
too
many
spices
added
so
it
just
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
really
enjoyable
d
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
it
passes
i
prefer
there
to
be
less
carbonation
a
more
dominant
pumpkin
flavor
less
sweetness
more
hopy
and
just
bigger
overall
d
this
brew
is
impossible
for
anyone
to
find
unpalatable
as
long
as
they
like
beer
but
it
really
could
use
a
bit
more
uuummmph
d
great
drinkability
altogether
well
rounded
and
complex
what
took
me
so
long
to
pick
this
off
the
shelf
is
totally
beyond
me
i
will
not
look
at
saranac
the
same
way
ever
again

d
i
really
really
hate
saranac
brews
i
bought
this
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixer
because
it
was
the
only
pumpkin
brew
available
and
i
was
in
the
mood
for
one
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
of
pumpkin
with
some
spices
taste
is
surprisingly
mild
pumpkin
with
some
malts
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
it
should
also
be
noted
that
matt
brewing
does
the
contract
work
for
brooklyn
brewing
and
their
post
road
pumpkin
ale
which
is
also
a
fine
recipe
but
i
prefer
saranac
pumpkin
a
delicious
autumn
reminder
s
p
a
pours
a
surprisingly
dark
rusty
color
the
nose
is
spicy
with
small
hints
of
pumkin
as
it
should
be
the
taste
is
heavy
and
dominating
thick
mouthfeel
with
roasted
malt
and
little
carbonation
this
finishes
heavy
but
i
could
totally
have
a
nice
big
slice
of
pumkin
pie
along
with
this
beer
d
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
because
it
wasnt
what
i
was
looking
for
would
have
liked
less
spice
and
more
of
a
vegetable
ale
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
pumpkin
pie
spice
flavor
this
is
a
good
one
to
start
with
and
it
goes
down
easy
clear
dark
copper
with
a
finger
of
smooth
tan
foam
that
leaves
some
nice
looking
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
pumpkin
pie
spicy
clove
cinnamon
allspice
etc
the
flavors
are
pretty
typical
for
the
style
spice
with
a
touch
of
pumpkin
but
the
spice
isnt
as
overwhelming
as
i
find
many
of
the
style
to
be
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
while
it
doesnt
blow
my
mind
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
drinkability
is
decent
the
brew
is
just
too
heavy
on
the
pumpkin
spices
it
tastes
like
pumpkin
pie
but
in
all
the
wrong
ways
the
malt
does
not
back
up
the
spice
enough
to
be
very
palatable
i
expect
more
from
some
of
the
more
notable
efforts
such
as
pumking
and
dfh
punkin
but
this
one
isnt
bad
and
is
worth
a
shot
in
the
season
not
the
most
complex
offering
in
this
category
not
saranacs
strong
point
but
an
all
around
good
sessionable
beer
for
the
fall
i
agree
with
charmcitycrab
that
a
seriously
pumpkiny
beer
would
be
very
exciting
drinkability
first
pumpkin
ale
and
well
anymore
then
one
of
these
would
be
unpleasant
it
doesnt
get
a
super
low
score
because
i
understand
the
brewers
reasoning
but
its
really
just
a
basic
ale
with
some
spices
hope
all
of
them
arent
like
this
the
beer
was
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
it
had
a
vaguely
spice
aroma
taste
was
pretty
much
all
cinnamon
and
clove
couldnt
really
appreciate
anything
else
the
beer
was
too
spiced
and
not
enough
malt
to
be
very
good
wont
drink
it
again
cheers
overall
a
great
representation
of
what
has
become
my
favorite
seasonal
beer
the
pumpkin
ale
cheers
d
i
thought
the
flavor
was
not
overbearing
could
have
used
some
more
pumpkin
and
less
of
the
pie
spices
all
in
all
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
not
a
go
to
but
i
would
have
another
nice
head
with
a
deep
amber
color
initial
nose
of
spice
heavy
on
the
cloves
light
carbonation
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
lingering
spice
taste
that
reminds
me
of
mace
taste
is
slightly
off
balance
and
the
overall
experience
is
somewhat
lacking
not
terrible
but
i
think
you
can
find
better
examples
of
the
style
overall
impression
a
highly
drinkable
lightly
spiced
pumpkin
ale
one
of
the
more
balanced
beers
out
there
nicely
done
final
thoughts
my
favorite
pumpkin
brew
by
a
long
shot
this
beer
is
sweet
and
reminds
me
of
thanksgiving
desert
the
dark
brown
ale
prevents
it
from
being
too
sweet
and
ultimately
completes
one
good
pumpkin
brew
d
awful
just
awful
i
love
pumpkin
anything
and
i
love
spices
but
this
was
an
abomination
to
beer
and
to
pumpkins
everywhere
drinks
slow
i
expected
more
from
these
guys
maybe
this
better
fresher
but
this
needs
some
malt
backbone
for
starters
disappointing

mouthfeel
was
a
bit
watery
for
a
pumpkin
ale
but
not
at
all
bad
overall
i
doubt
i
would
want
to
drink
a
session
but
a
few
will
do
perfectly
mouthfeeldrinkability
remaining
quite
effervescent
throughout
its
time
in
the
mouth
it
really
doesnt
add
or
take
away
anything
from
the
fact
that
this
beer
weighs
too
heavy
in
the
vanilla
and
not
much
in
malt
and
hops
a
real
challenge
to
finish
it
certainly
isnt
a
craft
beer
lovers
pumpkin
ale
imo
sure
id
be
able
to
drink
this
one
but
id
rather
have
something
else
i
think
nice
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
my
first
pumpkin
beer
of
the
season
good
start
i
would
have
another
cool
bottle
with
jackolantern
lets
you
know
what
this
one
is
up
front
smells
alot
like
a
pumpkin
pie
pumpkin
cinnamon
spices
sweet
malt
and
some
hops
way
in
the
background
nice
clear
brown
color
with
a
good
foamy
head
taste
is
well
balanced
nice
brown
ale
taste
with
pumpkin
highlights
good
steady
bitterness
throughout
pumpkin
comes
through
mostly
on
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
has
good
carbonation
and
body
no
wateryness
here
like
some
flavored
brews
this
is
a
good
brew
i
was
a
little
scared
by
the
imposing
jackolantern
and
expecting
a
bold
pumpkin
flavor
but
it
has
just
enough
pumpkin
to
go
with
a
strong
ale
backbone
a
great
beer
especially
for
the
fall
or
holiday
season
d
pleasant
and
certainly
sessionable
i
wouldnt
have
four
but
two
is
certainly
doable
without
palate
fatigue
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
chalky
dry
cinnamon
aftertaste
bring
up
the
rear
on
this
brew
close
to
the
holidays
this
one
really
hits
the
spot
i
like
the
subtlety
of
the
spices
and
the
roasted
flavors
this
one
makes
it
into
the
top
5
of
my
novelty
holiday
beer
lists
worth
a
try
if
you
are
feeling
whimsical
and
in
the
mood
for
something
very
fallish
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
drinkability
is
average
here
there
are
plenty
of
other
pumpkin
ales
and
although
this
one
isnt
bad
it
isnt
the
best
for
the
price
though
its
great
note
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
bottle
i
love
the
ferocious
yet
jolly
pumpkin
on
the
bottle
overall
it
was
decent
nothing
terrible
by
any
means
just
a
decent
fall
seasonal
here
i
would
try
it
again
but
not
my
favorite
so
far
a
decent
first
pumpkin
ale
experience
ive
found
very
few
pumpkin
ales
around
this
season
and
this
buffalo
bills
and
jacks
were
about
all
i
could
find
anywhere
not
bad
but
probably
wont
be
revistited
drinkability
not
hot
at
all
really
lacking
in
most
of
the
good
spice
notes
all
of
the
good
pumpkin
notes
most
of
the
good
malt
notes
too
cloying
sticky
afterfeely
not
recommended
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
with
1
finger
of
foamy
cream
colored
head
good
retention
and
spotty
lacing

pumpkin

tastes
of
pumpkin
honey
grainy

and

medium
to
medium
light
in

good

solid

but
balanced
very
sessionable
drank
three
gave
away
three
i
liked
other
pumpkin
ales
better
d
this
is
a
nice
pumpkin
beer
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
at
first
as
typically
fruitspicevegetableetc
beers
usually
tend
to
be
unbalanced
normally
cloyingly
sweet
and
unpalatable
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
it
is
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
i
dont
think
i
would
want
too
many
but
its
an
enjoyable
beer
d
exceptionally
drinkable
for
a
pumpkin
ale
although
i
think
the
name
spiced
amber
ale
fits
better
significantly
better
than
expected
a
nice
autumnal
beer
for
friends
who
like
minimally
hopped
ales
im
a
sucker
for
pumpkin
beers
this
one
is
not
a
good
one
though
d
actually
one
of
their
better
beers
just
a
tad
overspiced
but
still
has
a
moderately
good
drinkability
considering
the
style
drinkability
pretty
good
tasting
medium
bodied
with
a
abv
on
the
lower
side
good
enough
for
this
i
havent
tried
too
many
pumpkin
ales
ichabod
smuttynose
harvest
moon
so
i
cant
judge
too
much
in
comparison
but
this
one
is
as
good
as
the
rest
and
better
than
the
harvest
moon
d
not
a
bad
beer
after
about
3
of
them
the
taste
loses
its
edge
and
leaves
me
wanting
something
else
excellent
choice
for
the
fall
months
the
brew
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
light
head
that
disappears
quickly
and
fills
your
nostrils
with
the
scents
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
and
cloves
this
pumpkin
ale
tastes
amazing
with
not
too
much
sweetness
and
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
you
feel
like
you
are
drinking
a
beer
just
one
with
pumpkin
flavors
mixed
in
some
other
pumpkin
ales
make
me
think
i
am
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
flavored
soda
which
is
not
what
i
am
going
for
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
with
the
pumpkin
clearly
at
the
forefront
it
finishes
with
the
clove
and
cinnamon
the
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
great
choice
during
the
fall
pick
up
a
sixer
nice
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
certainly
would
fill
any
holiday
craving
this
time
of
year
i
think
this
is
just
above
average
not
that
great
a
nice
taste
for
this
time
of
year
but
are
definitely
better
ones
ie
dfw
punkin
ale
drinkability
this
a
a
very
good
pumpkin
ale
that
i
would
recommend
to
any
fans
of
the
style
this
would
be
an
ideal
beer
to
have
with
an
autumn
style
dessert
such
as
pumpkin
pie
or
baked
apples
try
this
one
out
you
wont
be
disappointed
drinkability
high
could
put
back
quite
a
few
of
these
sitting
by
the
fire
very
drinkable
pumpkin
beer
for
saranac
nice
pours
a
clear
cola
brown
with
almost
no
head
nose
is
spiced
flavor
is
spices
and
pumpkin
its
about
typical
imo
really
the
only
standout
characteristic
is
the
brown
sugar
tone
on
the
back
feel
has
a
noticed
carbonation
that
nibbles
a
bit
on
the
tongue
liquid
is
fine
this
is
a
nice
enough
pumpkin
ale
d
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
a
nice
example
of
a
spiced
ale
but
i
cannot
really
see
myself
sitting
down
and
drinking
a
whole
six
pack
of
these
maybe
two
in
a
row
at
most
the
spices
did
get
to
me
a
little
later
but
overall
it
was
pretty
good
d
not
my
top
pumpkin
ale
but
definitey
worth
drinking
a
good
standard
early
fall
ale
this
beer
poured
a
translucent
copper
with
a
singlefinger
head
the
scent
is
a
lot
of
spices
and
some
maltiness
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
malt
that
fades
into
some
pumpkin
in
middle
and
spices
and
a
bit
of
hops
towards
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
that
is
nice
and
drinkable
doverall
its
a
nice
beer
but
too
much
spic
if
they
had
let
up
on
the
spice
and
loaded
it
up
with
more
pumpkin
it
would
be
great
highly
recommended
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
very
nice
in
the
glass
a
dark
brownishorange
smelled
of
pumpkin
and
spices
as
youd
expect
the
taste
of
spices
was
stronger
than
pumpkin
but
there
definitely
was
a
balance
had
this
with
some
buffalo
wings
and
the
combination
was
superb
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
dont
drink
and
review
enjoy
d
a
very
nice
pumpkin
ale
good
for
bbqing
and
tailgating
in
the
fall
pours
a
very
nice
brown
color
with
amberorange
tints
and
has
fantastic
head
and
lacing
i
just
wish
the
beer
were
a
little
more
opaque
great
scent
very
deep
and
heady
with
great
pumpkin
spices
much
like
someone
dipped
a
pumpkin
pie
into
a
brown
ale
same
for
the
taste
a
very
nice
malty
deep
flavor
with
a
nice
hop
balance
along
with
avery
nice
pumpkin
pie
tastes
although
perhaps
just
a
bit
too
spicy
in
the
aftertaste
which
covers
up
some
of
the
other
great
beer
attributes
it
goes
down
quite
smoothly
the
feel
is
smooth
buttery
and
nice
always
a
good
sign
when
youre
suprised
its
almost
gone
saranac
puts
out
a
solid
pumpkin
beer
with
a
nice
amber
color
and
off
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
heavy
on
the
cinnamon
but
you
can
still
smell
the
other
pumpkin
pie
spices
the
flavor
is
decent
but
once
again
i
found
the
cinnamon
a
little
overpowering
the
medium
body
and
high
co2
make
this
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
d
despite
the
strange
flaws
this
is
a
decent
enough
pumpkin
ale
certainly
better
than
others
ive
had
funnily
enough
this
brew
both
excels
and
fails
simultaneously
in
each
respect
color
is
good
but
the
head
is
less
than
impressive
taste
starts
off
wonderfully
but
falls
into
nothingness
mouthfeel
starts
out
great
and
then
goes
watery
a
really
weird
brew
medium
bodied
smooth
and
perfectly
carbonated
i
might
drink
another
after
this
one
i
was
impressed
by
this
one
pours
a
beautiful
deep
amber
a
nice
spice
filled
smell
and
a
great
thick
body
with
plenty
of
tasty
spices
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
and
the
pumpkin
flavor
is
kept
in
check
very
good
beer
the
best
pumpkin
ale
that
i
have
had
for
this
year
the
spices
play
second
fiddle
to
the
pumpkin
in
this
one
the
way
it
should
be
the
spices
blend
togother
niceley
with
the
ginger
being
the
strongest
of
them
this
is
so
good
this
year
that
i
will
go
buy
at
least
a
case
for
the
holadays
for
desart
beer
try
this
one
if
you
see
it
its
well
worth
it
stillnot
one
of
the
best
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
yet
decent
not
bad
very
drinkable
lots
of
interesting
spices
and
flavors
to
keep
the
palate
sharp
the
beer
pours
a
tawny
brown
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
efforvesence
there
is
an
off
white
somewhat
creamy
head
a
bit
of
lacing
some
retention
too
the
aroma
is
heavily
tilted
in
the
direction
of
clove
some
bready
malts
in
there
too
there
is
a
tad
bit
of
cinnamon
as
well
the
taste
is
more
heavily
skewed
towards
the
allspice
and
clove
with
just
a
touch
of
pumpkin
there
really
isnt
that
much
pumpkin
flavors
emerging
the
vanilla
is
very
slight
in
the
nose
and
im
not
sure
if
im
detecting
any
at
all
in
the
taste
this
is
an
interesting
spiced
up
flavored
beer
that
i
ordinarily
avoid
because
they
tend
to
be
over
the
top
with
additives
not
so
saranak
pumpkin
the
beer
is
slightly
more
sharp
and
crisp
than
smooth
there
is
a
refreshing
autumnal
quality
to
the
beer
and
it
is
befitting
the
season
worth
a
try
d
easy
to
put
this
down
and
i
could
get
loaded
quick
because
you
can
barely
taste
the
alcohol
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lace
smell
has
some
clove
to
it
and
some
spice
nothing
over
powering
this
beer
tastes
more
like
a
marzen
beer
than
anything
i
can
only
detect
a
faint
taste
of
pumpkin
and
spice
overall
not
bad
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
this
does
go
down
pretty
smooth
and
i
actually
enjoyed
it
and
woud
drink
again
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
this
dark
amber
ale
pours
with
nice
thick
head
strong
yet
not
unappealing
the
carbonation
is
evident
from
the
start
it
settles
though
not
to
quickly
into
a
light
lace
the
smell
is
sweet
and
full
of
aroma
typical
of
this
type
of
beer
the
malty
taste
is
accented
well
with
the
subtle
pumpkin
and
spices
its
mouthful
was
definitely
a
welcome
refresher
after
the
summer
months
of
lighter
beers
getting
me
even
more
excited
for
the
coming
fall
whether
and
the
seasonal
brews
it
will
bring
a
nicely
rounded
and
not
overly
sweet
pumpkin
ale
worth
going
back
for
another
a
very
pumpkin
beer
loads
of
spice
but
it
almost
has
more
of
a
winter
spice
flair
to
it
then
just
your
typical
pumpkin
pie
type
beer
anyway
still
a
great
beer
from
saranac
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pumpkin
and
spice
scent
that
boasts
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
it
also
has
a
bit
of
crystal
malt
whick
adds
a
layer
of
sweetness
to
the
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
spicey
flavor
that
seems
to
blend
in
well
with
the
crystal
malts
the
pumpkin
taste
is
muttled
a
bit
because
of
this
however
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
quite
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
pumpkin
beer
its
spicier
than
most
but
i
guess
you
have
to
set
yourself
apart
somehow
pours
an
iced
tea
color
with
a
shortlived
cream
colored
head
that
settled
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
is
of
a
light
lemony
caramel
malt
with
pumpkin
allspice
clove
and
cinnamon
nice
pumpkin
aroma
the
taste
is
of
a
light
caramel
malt
a
bit
watery
and
lemony
but
has
nice
subtle
pumpkin
flavors
and
bolder
pumpkin
pie
spices
such
as
allspice
and
cinnamon
again
the
feel
is
a
bit
light
not
as
malty
as
other
pumpkins
and
has
a
slight
astringent
pucker
for
my
first
pumpkin
of
the
season
this
hit
the
spot
it
is
a
respectable
pumpkin
ale
not
overly
spicey
notes
overall
its
a
little
bit
too
unbalanced
on
the
spicy
side
not
the
greatest
pumpkin
ale
but
surprisingly
good
for
saranac
ive
had
this
beer
out
of
the
bottle
before
and
gotten
a
way
different
read
on
the
body
and
flavor
but
this
draft
was
spot
on
tasty
m
d
lighter
to
medium
body
a
seltzerlike
carbonation
finishes
quite
crisp
which
is
nice
a
pleasant
and
relaxed
beer
and
something
i
could
see
going
back
to
over
the
season
saranac
simply
does
not
do
a
bad
beer
theyre
not
all
excellent
but
all
are
quality
choices
this
is
certainly
one
of
their
best
beers
and
this
is
among
my
favorite
types
of
beer
to
have
well
done
if
not
a
bit
spiced
thoroughly
enjoyable
picked
up
a
case
of
this
on
sale
several
weeks
ago
having
tasted
several
pumpkin
ales
over
the
holiday
season
i
have
to
say
that
this
one
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
will
have
to
concur
with
some
of
the
other
reviews
that
it
defiantly
has
a
strong
spicy
odor
and
taste
of
cinnamon
vanilla
and
pumpkin
saranac
does
a
nice
job
with
this
beer
and
the
price
19
00
case
a
horribly
overspiced
mess
flavored
way
too
heavily
with
nutmeg
and
allspice
it
masks
any
favorable
attribute
to
the
brew
terrible
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingers
forever
a
real
disappointment
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
brewery
that
usually
puts
out
a
decent
product
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brownishamber
color
with
a
medium
thin
and
creamy
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
steadily
stringy
lacing
the
aroma
is
mildly
malty
with
hints
of
allspice
and
cinnamon
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
a
bland
concoction
of
spice
and
malt
flavors
the
finish
is
earthy
malt
with
a
mild
lingering
spice
aftertaste
pumpkin
beers
are
hit
or
miss
in
my
experience
and
this
is
definitely
a
miss
pours
a
light
to
medium
brown
color
with
a
off
white
head
that
fades
quickly
with
some
mild
lacing
aromas
are
mild
and
mostly
of
the
spices
sweet
taste
with
cinnamon
allspicecloves
and
vanilla
all
there
maybe
a
little
too
much
vanilla
for
my
taste
but
all
in
all
not
bad
light
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
is
good
you
can
drink
a
few
of
these
without
tiring
of
the
taste
all
in
all
not
a
bad
pumpkin
ale
from
saranac
that
actually
exceeded
my
expectations
somewhat
a
nice
aroma
and
lighter
body
help
keep
this
guy
fairly
drinkable
smooth
enough
to
drink
a
bunch
of
but
i
dont
know
why
youd
want
to
with
the
generally
bland
taste
not
overbearing
which
adds
to
drinkability
at
least
it
has
a
decent
beer
base
other
than
just
pumpkin
and
its
not
overly
spiced
worth
checking
out
but
i
cant
see
a
true
pumpkin
ale
lover
going
crazy
over
it
straight
up
an
awesome
example
of
pumpkin
ale
this
one
is
a
real
winner
if
you
are
a
fan
of
pumpkin
brews
the
pumpkin
flavor
and
vanilla
really
stand
out
and
make
for
a
unique
and
special
beer
great
with
anything
sweet
nice
orange
amber
color
leads
to
an
explosion
of
sweet
satisfying
pumpkin
goodness
the
cinnamon
and
ginger
flavors
are
also
present
too
any
pumpkin
ale
fan
must
try
this
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
without
a
doubt
try
to
get
your
hands
on
this
one
while
you
still
can
too
bad
it
isnt
brewed
yearround
so
now
i
sit
here
drinking
the
last
of
them
i
had
saved
it
since
it
was
the
winner
of
the
pumpkin
shootout
it
has
nice
spice
could
be
a
little
stronger
it
works
better
than
the
others
i
tried
this
fall
now
on
to
the
xmas
ales
beautiful
amberautumn
colors
smells
of
spices
but
not
too
strong
taste
is
much
the
same
light
spices
come
through
mostly
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
smooth
and
nice
for
the
time
of
year
although
not
my
favorite
pumpkin
ale
decent
offering
though
especially
when
its
free
makes
it
taste
that
much
better
cool
bottle
too
with
the
jackolantern
on
it
worth
a
try
nice
one
to
drink
on
halloween
which
i
did
cheers
and
saaaalute
my
ba
friends
drinkability
great
stuff
heading
to
a
halloween
party
near
me
d
a
pretty
average
pumpkin
the
ale
just
doesnt
provide
enough
of
a
foundation
for
the
flavor
dirnkability
wise
there
are
moments
that
are
tasty
but
it
fails
to
wow
me
overall
i
found
it
drinkable
for
the
price
at
the
px
since
it
was
less
than
6
for
a
sixer
i
probably
wont
revisit
the
experience
though
taste
is
also
very
clean
but
a
tad
thin
i
say
clean
because
some
pumpkin
ales
are
so
heavily
spiced
that
they
become
harsh
the
spices
here
are
not
overdone
but
i
think
this
could
use
a
bit
more
body
very
light
malt
base
to
it
that
lends
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
feels
too
thin
a
nicely
drinkable
pumpkin
ale
though
i
love
pumpkin
ale
and
saranacs
is
pretty
good
but
it
falls
short
of
others
ive
had
such
as
brooklyn
brewerys
post
road
and
john
harvards
pumpkin
spice
that
said
saranac
pumpkin
ale
has
a
very
nice
orange
appearance
with
a
smell
of
nutmeg
spice
and
hints
of
pumpkin
the
taste
follows
suit
some
lacing
on
the
glass
a
tad
bitter
but
a
nice
dry
finish
pick
this
up
if
you
like
pumpkin
ales
and
judge
for
yourself
the
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
light
for
an
ale
making
it
very
drinkable
i
liked
this
a
little
more
than
some
others
ive
tried
but
i
still
havent
found
a
pumpkin
beverage
to
match
the
best
ive
had
a
slice
of
pie
in
a
glass
i
think
if
the
sweetness
could
be
boosted
on
this
one
it
would
come
close
but
as
is
its
not
bad
for
one
or
two
but
id
quickly
look
for
other
tastes
this
isnt
the
best
pumpkin
beer
ive
had
but
it
is
definatly
worth
trying
more
spice
flavors
than
pumpkin
flavors
just
not
too
much
complexity
here
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
nice
lighter
medium
bodied
brew
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
highly
quaffable
its
a
solid
balanced
brew
for
the
fall
season
worth
a
try
thats
about
it
d
lowest
drinkability
of
the
sampler
6
pack
happy
that
i
only
had
just
one
didnt
thrill
me
the
pumpkin
flavor
i
found
a
bit
weak
however
with
its
very
seasonal
appearance
we
have
here
a
great
ale
for
october
the
smell
of
pumpkin
is
at
least
here
that
great
combination
of
cinnamon
and
spice
the
appearance
as
it
poured
out
was
a
great
pumpkinlike
amber
color
but
the
drink
is
all
masked
by
a
crisp
albeit
sweet
taste
that
lacked
a
true
pumpkin
punch
i
was
a
little
taken
aback
by
the
great
carbonation
of
the
drink
however
this
allows
it
to
be
a
very
accessible
drink
for
the
season
i
drank
of
few
of
these
this
afternoon
to
enhance
my
day
off
the
only
thing
taking
away
from
this
nice
fall
beer
was
the
fact
that
it
was
about
95
outside
the
beer
pours
a
really
nice
amber
color
with
a
pale
head
the
smell
is
great
with
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
really
coming
through
has
a
good
solid
taste
but
i
would
like
a
little
more
of
the
cinnamon
to
come
through
like
in
the
pumpkin
head
made
by
shipyard
still
a
really
good
seasonal
drinkability
a
nice
seasonal
great
for
the
fall
the
pour
is
beautiful
with
a
dark
amber
color
resembling
the
top
of
a
pumpkin
pie
the
white
head
is
reminiscent
of
the
whipped
cream
on
top
the
smell
is
very
good
with
a
hint
of
a
pumpkin
pie
flavor
the
taste
is
really
good
but
not
quite
as
pumpkiny
as
i
was
hoping
the
cinnamon
is
very
overpowering
and
not
as
much
nutmeg
as
i
would
hope
the
feelis
very
good
with
perfect
carbonation
for
a
beer
of
this
gravity
overall
very
drinkable
but
only
for
a
few
very
nice
fall
beer
personally
i
can
only
have
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
time
kind
of
like
a
dessert
beer
overall
overall
this
is
a
tasty
pumpkin
beer
not
the
best
on
the
market
but
as
one
of
the
cheeper
pumpkin
beers
out
there
it
holds
up
to
the
style
and
stands
it
ground
in
the
land
of
pumpkin
beers
i
would
buy
again
this
poured
a
pleasant
dark
brown
with
a
white
head
that
lingered
smell
is
spicy
cloves
and
cinnamon
taste
is
quite
nice
to
put
it
very
simply
liquid
pumpkin
pie
this
is
exactly
what
i
would
expect
a
pumpkin
ale
should
taste
like
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
and
quite
easy
to
drink
put
simply
matt
brewing
has
done
it
again
succeeding
in
delivering
a
good
easy
drinking
well
crafted
brew
theres
nothing
to
hate
about
saranac
pumpkin
ale
because
it
has
no
real
negatives
trouble
is
it
isnt
exactly
bursting
with
positives
unfortunately
the
same
can
be
said
for
most
beer
from
these
guys
heres
hoping
my
next
pumpkin
ale
will
have
more
fire
in
its
belly
not
too
strong
of
an
odor
but
that
could
be
a
good
thing
when
it
comes
to
pumpkin
beer
the
taste
is
pretty
balanced
between
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
but
it
isnt
overpowering
or
grainy
like
some
other
pumpkins
i
have
recently
tried
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
brew
and
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
this
season
ahhh
back
to
normal
that
nose
was
just
wrong
but
that
character
displayed
is
not
in
the
taste
chewy
malt
character
with
a
nutty
approach
with
very
minor
flavors
of
all
spice
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
pumpkin
highly
carbonated
and
somewhat
flavorless
not
a
beer
id
drink
often
overall
not
bad
at
all
saranac
put
together
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
here
definitely
worthy
of
a
pint
or
2
light
and
zesty
mouthfeel
good
pumpking
beernot
a
standouteasy
to
drink
go
session
beer
for
a
halloween
night
pours
an
amber
color
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
one
of
pumpkin
and
spice
except
that
it
seems
thin
taste
is
much
of
the
same
except
that
the
pumpkin
fades
into
a
nice
malt
background
its
much
like
a
pumpkin
pie
but
not
quite
as
much
as
the
shipyard
somewhat
sweet
as
well
i
think
its
a
decent
pumpkin
ale
but
as
i
said
nowhere
as
good
as
other
offerings
of
this
style
ive
had
overall
not
a
bad
contribution
to
the
pumpkinoctoberfest
genre
perhaps
my
only
letdown
is
that
ive
been
spoiled
by
dogfishhead
punkin
ale
which
is
much
stronger
in
flavor
and
alcohol
its
like
egg
nog
i
wouldnt
appreciate
it
yearround
but
im
likely
to
enjoy
a
sixer
or
two
when
it
comes
around
for
noveltys
sake
i
think
my
wife
would
really
like
it
and
thats
always
a
plus
as
far
as
fall
pumpkin
beers
or
ales
i
think
this
is
far
and
away
the
best
that
i
have
had
if
there
are
better
ones
out
there
i
look
forward
to
trying
them
d
drinkability
was
a
low
rating
because
of
the
disappointment
of
the
lack
of
anything
pumpkin
glad
i
only
bought
a
6
pack
and
not
a
case
single
from
whole
foods
raleigh
malty
is
the
dominant
taste
with
minimal
spice
and
an
underlying
metal
aspect
often
a
saranac
bugaboo
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
a
little
too
artificial
tasting
but
does
present
a
full
round
flavor
a
decent
touch
of
pumpkin
flavor
shows
up
in
the
aftertaste
but
really
too
little
too
late
unfortunately
this
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
awful
but
not
much
better
than
mediocre
bitey
mouthfeel
and
very
low
drinkability
my
wife
loves
the
pumpkins
so
ive
got
to
try
them
all
despite
liking
but
a
very
few
drinkability
saranacs
pumpkin
ale
is
good
example
of
a
pumpkin
ale
with
a
medium
body
and
well
balanced
mix
of
spices
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
good
pumpkin
beer
worth
trying
if
youve
never
had
one
and
definitely
pick
one
up
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
one
of
the
better
choices
in
the
style
this
could
work
well
as
a
dessert
beer
by
itself
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
my
choice
for
a
great
go
to
pumpkin
ale
if
you
like
the
style
this
is
one
to
try
d
not
a
bad
pumpkin
selection
not
overly
flavored
but
not
too
watered
down
either
im
sorry
for
the
lack
of
better
terms
nothing
too
special
but
id
pick
one
up
next
year
thanks
jhammerly
for
another
chance
to
get
out
of
my
local
world
of
beers
clear
medium
dark
brown
not
much
int
he
way
of
a
head
it
dissapeared
jsut
after
pouring
nose
first
smells
like
bbq
pulled
pork
or
some
smoked
brisket
next
it
reminds
me
of
beef
boullion
if
i
concentrate
ral
hard
i
kind
of
get
pumpkin
kind
of
get
spice
but
mostly
bbq
and
beef
boulion
sorry
peeps
the
taste
screams
of
pumpkin
with
some
decent
spice
finishes
with
good
pumpkin
flavors
lingers
long
on
the
palate
near
zero
carbonation
but
a
decently
creamy
mouthfeel
appears
an
amber
caramel
hue
with
a
large
creamy
off
white
head
and
it
leaves
nice
bands
of
even
lace
around
my
nonic
pint
glass
aroma
is
perfect
with
soft
mellow
spices
including
cinnamon
all
spice
and
clove
of
course
the
famous
gourd
the
pumpkin
presence
is
there
as
well
and
it
does
justice
to
this
often
overdone
style
flavor
has
caramel
malt
presence
with
light
but
evident
we
get
the
point
doses
of
spice
and
everyones
invited
to
the
party
with
the
pumpkin
pie
spices
and
and
earthy
vegetable
tone
we
have
ourselves
some
pretty
good
stuff
here
balance
equals
good
in
a
pumpkin
ale
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slight
syrupy
character
with
even
carbonation
flows
very
nicely
glass
empties
itself
drinkability
this
should
be
the
standard
for
the
style
flavorful
yet
doesnt
make
my
stomach
wrench
after
the
first
pint
of
it
drinkability
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
it
tastes
like
an
ale
that
was
injected
with
cinnamon
there
isnt
any
complexity
and
there
is
very
little
if
any
pumpkin
flavor
md
medium
body
and
drinkability
smooth
but
not
blanaced
all
to
well
and
average
brew
overall
a
pretty
good
attempt
at
a
pumpkin
ale
but
like
most
others
this
one
still
left
me
wanting
more
from
it
than
what
i
got
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
and
much
more
refreshing
my
favorite
fall
beer
is
probably
a
tie
between
this
and
smuttynoses
pumpkin
ale
very
drinkable
very
crisp
very
delicious
beer
the
saranac
lacks
the
boldness
of
some
great
beers
but
more
than
makes
up
for
it
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
lighter
body
that
make
for
excellent
drinkability
this
pumpkin
ale
makes
a
great
starting
point
for
the
newly
adventurous
drinker
or
as
a
beer
to
convert
the
keystoneloving
beer
heathens
but
really
this
is
just
a
beer
for
anyone
that
likes
pumpkin
pie
drinking
this
beer
feels
like
drinking
a
pumpkin
pie
lots
of
pumpkin
and
cinnamon
flavor
very
similar
style
to
a
winter
beer
great
copper
coloring
poured
very
nicely
probably
would
not
want
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
session
priced
very
reasonably
for
a
seasonal
brew
overall
a
nice
overall
pumpkin
ale
that
covers
all
the
bases
is
fine
with
me
the
spices
dont
do
you
in
on
this
tastey
its
not
the
greatest
fall
offering
but
it
deserves
to
be
around
each
season
d
its
a
good
one
to
feed
to
the
masses
if
they
dont
really
care
what
they
are
drinking
i
wont
go
ouot
of
my
way
to
get
this
again
as
is
the
case
with
almost
all
pumpkin
ales
what
were
really
talking
about
here
is
a
spiced
ale
the
use
of
real
pumpkin
pulp
doesnt
generally
lend
much
flavor
to
the
beer
but
the
spice
does
the
question
then
becomes
is
it
balanced
well
yes
it
is
matt
has
done
an
excellent
job
with
this
one
clearly
laying
out
the
pumpkin
pie
character
yet
keeping
it
just
on
the
edge
of
going
overboard
the
spice
is
clear
and
upfront
in
both
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
with
the
cinnamon
and
allspice
very
noticeable
in
the
flavor
and
the
vanilla
and
clove
more
clear
in
the
aroma
but
not
so
much
in
the
flavor
where
its
kind
of
drowned
out
the
allspice
and
cinnamon
dominate
although
the
clove
follows
close
behind
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
is
just
enough
to
support
the
spiciness
and
it
doesnt
become
sweet
the
bitterness
is
therefore
kept
low
to
achieve
that
and
really
its
not
needed
the
spice
does
the
job
and
i
think
that
perhaps
the
vanilla
even
though
its
lowkey
in
the
flavor
is
enough
to
stimulate
the
brain
into
thinking
that
its
sweeter
and
softer
than
it
might
actually
be
so
although
im
still
not
sure
that
there
can
ever
be
any
real
level
of
drinkability
to
a
pumpkin
ale
the
saranac
pumpkin
is
at
the
very
least
one
of
the
best
first
beers
at
halloween
or
anytime
during
the
fall
season
and
may
pass
secondbeer
muster
well
done
absolutely
worth
trying
for
those
who
enjoy
pumpkin
ales
or
even
spiced
beers
in
general
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
full
bodied
which
is
very
nice
and
fits
with
expectations
of
this
style
higher
levels
of
carbonation
give
a
nice
feeling
on
the
tongue
once
this
beer
is
swallowed
this
beer
is
an
easy
drink
and
is
quite
enjoyable
however
unless
this
is
the
only
pumpkin
beer
that
i
can
get
my
hands
on
this
season
i
will
not
be
purchasing
this
particular
brand
again
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
good
beer
but
i
know
that
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
that
really
shine
in
this
style
dogfish
head
punkin
ale
is
fantastic
and
i
would
recommend
that
over
this
any
day
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
moderate
white
puffy
head
smell
denotes
a
mild
clove
note
but
little
else
taste
is
also
a
bit
spicy
with
a
light
detection
of
cloves
finish
is
nice
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
excellent
drinkability
somewhat
lacking
as
a
pumpkin
ale
but
still
a
nice
beer
cheers
a
slighty
above
average
pumpkin
ale
from
saranac
ive
said
this
before
about
other
beers
in
this
style
and
ill
say
it
again
its
no
smuttynose
pumpkin
ale
drinkability
one
of
the
better
pumpkins
out
there
a
pleasant
surprise
from
a
brewery
that
has
often
been
a
disappointment
to
me
drinkability
basically
this
beer
was
a
lot
like
the
label
it
was
nonoffensive
non
threatening
and
very
little
was
going
on
what
can
i
say
at
least
its
cheap
i
couldnt
commit
to
buying
a
sixpack
and
only
bought
a
single
im
glad
i
only
got
one
bottle
this
was
the
first
time
ive
had
saranacs
pumpkin
ale
it
pours
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
moderate
soapy
head
the
aroma
is
as
notable
for
the
spice
as
it
is
for
the
pumpkin
i
picked
up
a
lot
of
cinnamon
vanilla
and
ginger
the
pumpkin
is
also
present
but
didnt
seem
to
have
the
same
prominence
as
the
spice
theres
also
an
underlying
mildly
toasted
malt
and
grain
character
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
lot
of
spice
flavor
the
brew
is
a
little
more
carbonated
than
necessary
giving
it
a
distracting
effervescence
that
i
dont
think
fits
well
with
the
style
still
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
brewslightly
sweet
pumpkinpie
flavor
and
fully
appropriate
for
the
season
body
is
light
to
medium
with
the
dull
mouthfeel
that
accompanys
every
offering
from
this
brewery
easy
to
put
away
nontheless
especially
while
noshing
on
a
steaming
bowl
of
sweet
potato
and
crab
bisque
and
buttered
toasted
baguette
from
a
12
oz
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
decent
copperamber
color
with
very
little
head
that
dissipated
quickly
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
very
lacking
in
the
smell
department
all
i
smell
is
basic
sweet
malts
no
special
pumpkin
spices
at
all
flavor
was
similarly
lacking
slight
sweetness
with
the
first
taste
the
aftertaste
had
some
basic
pumpkin
spice
flavors
cinnamon
mostly
after
the
first
taste
there
wasnt
anything
there
for
me
however
and
all
i
got
was
a
very
slight
sweetness
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
smooth
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkable
but
as
many
others
have
said
why
would
you
bother
when
theres
so
many
other
better
pumpkin
ales
pours
a
clear
coppercaramel
color
with
a
frothy
but
low
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
rise
up
much
and
then
recedes
very
quickly
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
cinnamon
flavor
is
initially
cinnamon
followed
by
some
sweet
malt
and
then
a
strong
nutmeg
flavor
clara
peller
would
probably
taste
this
beer
and
say
wheres
the
pumpkin
i
honestly
dont
detect
any
theres
a
hint
of
buttered
corn
in
the
finish
followed
by
a
misplaced
peppery
bite
that
lingers
the
taste
is
not
bad
but
im
scoring
it
low
because
its
missing
the
main
ingredient
mouthfeel
is
smooth
full
moderate
carbonation
its
fairly
drinkable
but
why
bother
there
are
so
many
other
better
pumpkin
beers
served
in
a
pint
glass
it
pours
an
amber
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
at
all
it
smells
like
bready
malt
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
some
pumpkin
it
pretty
much
tastes
the
same
way
but
theres
more
of
a
spicy
taste
than
a
pumpkin
taste
theres
also
a
small
bitter
aftertaste
but
it
doesnt
last
long
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
slick
and
it
has
moderate
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
the
beer
is
ok
i
could
drink
it
every
once
in
a
while
drinkability
is
fine
but
why
would
you
want
to
cant
recommend
this
one
even
though
i
love
dfh
and
bklyns
pumpkin
ale
efforts
a
fine
example
of
this
style
and
one
of
saranacs
better
offerings
admittedly
i
am
not
a
fan
of
pumpkin
pie
but
i
always
look
forward
to
the
fall
pumpkin
beer
each
yearthis
poured
a
light
copper
with
a
12
finger
white
head
that
was
gone
quite
fast
seems
to
be
quite
carbonated
and
somewhat
spritzey
pumpkin
spice
mainly
in
the
nose
cinnamon
and
mace
stick
out
mainly
a
hint
of
nutmeg
and
an
underlying
toasted
grain
charactera
sharp
even
light
mouthfeel
didnt
like
the
feeling
of
that
much
subdued
spice
flavors
not
over
the
top
quite
pleasant
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
mainly
even
a
touch
of
butter
not
bad
flavors
but
the
thin
sharp
mouthfeel
is
undesirable
in
my
mind
and
it
takes
away
from
its
drinkabilitynot
bad
but
wont
seek
out
again
its
not
that
i
didnt
like
this
beer
i
just
think
my
expectations
were
a
little
high
this
is
my
first
experience
with
autumnal
beers
and
after
having
consumed
many
belgianstyle
ales
i
thought
this
may
have
that
big
slightly
sweet
flavor
i
associate
with
fruity
beers
now
that
i
know
what
to
expect
i
would
drink
this
again
appearance
is
a
nice
deep
brownish
orange
hue
although
surprisingly
clear
with
a
fair
amount
of
visible
carbonation
and
no
head
retention
the
aroma
is
very
subtle
but
pleasant
and
has
layers
of
vanilla
and
clove
the
taste
is
of
warm
spices
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
with
a
faint
hint
of
pumpkin
and
a
sweet
malt
flavor
that
carries
through
to
the
end
a
small
but
noticeable
hop
balance
the
smell
and
taste
seem
to
be
more
fall
spices
in
general
than
anything
inherently
pumpkin
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
overall
an
easily
drinkable
beer
but
i
didnt
find
the
pumpkin
to
be
nearly
as
pronounced
as
i
would
have
expected
from
the
style
and
label
art
first
pumpkin
ale
of
the
season
and
not
bad
at
all
pours
a
crystal
clear
copperorange
with
a
nice
sized
offwhite
head
pretty
good
retention
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
rather
faint
vanilla
overlaid
with
a
vague
cinammon
spiciness
a
litle
clove
as
the
beer
warms

is
a
nice
solid
slightly
toasty
malt
imbued
with
a
nice
amount

allspice
and
clovea
moderate
pumpkin
coming
through
in
the
middle
finishing
with
a
nice
spicey
pumpkin
pie
aftertaste
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
a
really
solid
seasonal
by
saranac
maybe
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
out
there
but
for
the
price
its
worth
getting
a
few
six
packs
d
im
glad
i
bought
just
the
one
bottle
of
this
im
not
wellversed
in
the
style
but
i
still
cant
get
past
the
finish
its
actually
pretty
promising
up
until
then
it
smelled
great
and
the
front
of
the
sip
was
pleasant
pours
amberorange
decent
head
goes
into
a
moderate
laceing
lots
of
bubbles
smell
is
sweet
and
spicy
cinnamon
and
allspice
mostly
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
body
is
thin
and
carbonated
taste
is
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
up
front
with
a
dry
allspice
finish
liked
it
i
was
expecting
more
flavor
out
of
this
one
i
guess
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
id
opt
for
something
else
next
time
given
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
herbedspiced
ales
its
not
a
big
surprise
that
i
didnt
dig
this
one
nonetheless
i
couldnt
get
past
the
artificial
flavor
and
overused
spices
i
consider
myself
a
pumpkin
ale
aficionado
of
sorts
and
find
myself
comparing
all
i
can
find
to
taste
this
one
is
easily
one
of
my
favoritesat
least
of
those
that
are
bottled
saranacmatt
does
it
again
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
to
see
at
the
local
store
in
august
happy
early
halloween
i
like
pumpkin
beers
i
think
it
is
the
perfect
cold
weather
brew
this
saranac
pumpkin
is
much
easier
drinking
than
most
it
is
light
and
crisp
and
doesnt
get
bogged
down
in
heavy
spiciness
its
utterly
inoffensive
and
somewhat
indifferent
but
its
not
bad
for
what
thats
worth
theres
a
slightly
savory
splash
of
spicy
sass
with
just
enough
malt
and
yeast
to
balance
things
out
while
nothing
to
write
home
about
maybe
its
enjoyable
enough
to
have
one
or
two
more
hey
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
last
swigs
plenty
of
pumpkin
but
became
a
bit
tongue
coating
a
solid
pumpkin
ale
from
matt
brewing
poured
out
to
a
dark
orange
color
with
a
dense
head
of
about
34
of
an
inch
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
pumpkin
cinnamon
spices
and
herbs
fill
the
nose
taste
is
comparable
to
aroma
pumpkin
spice
brown
sugar
roasted
malt
and
a
minor
hop
presence
makes
this
brew
a
bit
more
complex
than
other
pumpkin
brews
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
yet
retained
a
lagerlike
drinkability
making
it
light
and
smooth
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
better
pumpkin
ales
ive
had
recommended
thanks
to
connecticutpoet
for
the
sample
brew
poured
to
dull
amber
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
does
not
have
much
retention
but
did
leave
some
lacing
around
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
spices
but
they
are
not
as
strong
as
i
thought
they
would
be
seems
to
be
tame
compared
to
other
pumpkin
ales
i
have
had
this
season
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
the
taste
is
nice
very
smooth
malt
characteristics
seem
to
dominate
with
the
spices
hitting
the
taste
buds
a
little
bit
after
the
initial
malt
flavors
over
all
this
is
a
nice
brew
one
that
i
will
get
again
next
year
if
saranac
comes
out
with
it
again
nice
effort
put
forth
by
matts
oooh
peppery
and
some
taste
of
ground
cumin
cinnamon
galore
and
nutmeg
too
yowza
like
i
said
very
powerfully
frontloaded
on
taste
and
mouthfeel
which
drops
off
considerably
read
too
much
as
i
let
it
linger
or
swallow
it
i
like
it
but
i
see
potential
unrealized
god
what
neat
vanilla
drinkability
is
a
little
below
average
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
spices
pours
a
dark
brown
with
mahogany
highlights
a
very
small
head
formed
after
an
aggressive
pour
the
aroma
is
a
very
strong
malt
base
with
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
other
spices
not
much
in
the
way
of
pumpkin
but
everything
you
associate
with
the
spicing
of
pumpkins
the
taste
is
very
spiced
up
it
starts
with
a
pleasant
maltiness
the
spices
namely
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
come
in
very
quickly
and
take
over
nothing
else
is
really
allowed
to
come
through
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
any
pumpkin
taste
it
seems
like
an
amber
thats
been
spiced
to
heck
not
bad
per
se
but
not
very
good
either
not
being
a
fan
of
spiced
beers
winter
warmer
included
the
drinkability
on
this
is
just
not
very
good
the
body
of
this
beer
seemed
watery
and
unimpressive
but
gave
way
to
an
aroma
of
vanilla
and
spice
there
was
a
very
slight
hint
of
a
chocolatycaramelcoffee
i
cant
put
myfinger
on
there
is
more
of
that
in
the
flavor
which
was
suprising
vanilla
and
hints
of
caramel
and
cinnamon
spice
the
mouthfeel
was
mediocre
watery
and
almost
a
flat
feel
once
again
i
need
to
have
more
pumpkins
to
get
a
better
feel
of
the
style
drinkability
decent
enough
nothing
special
here
saranac
beers
tend
to
be
pretty
good
and
this
one
is
no
exception
very
smooth
warming
on
a
cold
rainy
night
such
as
this
and
not
too
expensive
nor
cheap
a
mellow
take
on
a
pumpkin
ale
worthy
of
a
second
slice
drinkability
pretty
tasty
it
may
not
be
the
ultimate
example
of
the
style
but
id
definitely
buy
it
again
its
not
overly
spiced
which
to
me
way
too
many
pumpkin
ales
are
and
thats
what
it
makes
it
so
highly
drinkable
nice
pumpkin
flavor
which
is
surprising
also
there
is
a
noticeable
hop
finish
which
my
nose
could
not
detect
i
like
the
body
full
and
carbonation
moderate
this
is
a
drier
beer
than
many
pumpkins
are
made
i
tend
to
like
this
style
more
than
the
sweeter
heavier
malted
beers
still
there
is
some
wonderful
flavors
and
complexities
here
from
the
bottle
a
nice
amber
color
little
head
which
was
probably
my
fault
smell
wasnt
readily
apparent
though
i
could
sense
the
cinnamon
spices
on
first
sip
was
a
little
taken
aback
as
it
was
my
first
pumpkin
beer
second
try
could
taste
the
cinnamon
and
it
was
good
good
hints
of
vanilla
and
other
spices
were
vaguely
present
felt
like
a
normal
beer
nothing
too
spectacular
in
that
repect
after
about
half
a
pint
i
thought
the
vanilla
was
overpowering
a
little
bit
should
have
had
some
food
to
complement
definitely
not
a
beer
to
sit
down
to
and
drink
away
but
paired
with
some
good
autumny
food
id
say
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
to
drink
once
in
a
while
looks
great
nice
dark
and
crystal
clear
with
sizeable
head
of
medium
density
aroma
has
a
peppery
spice
to
it
blended
plethora
of
additives
and
subtle
on
the
pumpkin
essence
an
even
maltiness
subexists
overall
excessively
sweet
tasting
heavy
on
the
vanilla
and
sweeter
cinnamon
aspects
mild
pumpkin
if
any
at
all
a
bit
too
light
and
bubbly
mouthfeelwise
tastes
like
dogfish
punkin
mixed
with
a
bud
light
noble
effort
but
a
failure
in
the
grand
scheme
of
fall
beers
this
is
a
rather
tasty
pumpkin
ale
it
pours
a
nice
amberish
color
the
head
is
plentiful
and
lasting
the
aroma
is
nicely
spicey
the
taste
is
pumpkinish
pleasantly
spiced
while
not
overwheling
the
spices
are
enough
to
limit
the
drinkability
of
this
ale
this
is
certainly
a
pumpkin
ale
worthy
of
your
time
enjoy
quite
the
pumpkin
pie
aroma
nice
malty
pumpkin
base
with
spiced
accents
of
nutmeg
and
clove
poured
a
small
dark
tan
head
thaht
faded
quickly
to
a
thin
film
transparent
dark
caramel
colored
beer
that
shows
no
signs
of
life
light
pumpkin
pie
spices
mix
with
a
solid
bready
malt
and
pumplin
core
there
is
a
bit
of
tea
flavor
in
there
but
otherwise
the
flavors
simply
meld
into
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
somewhere
between
watery
and
soft
saranac
beers
tend
to
be
light
on
flavor
but
this
one
has
more
then
usual
and
strikes
a
nice
balance
of
spices
and
malt
the
beer
is
rather
life
less
the
head
is
there
for
about
half
a
minute
and
then
gone
poof
i
t
has
a
really
deep
copper
color
closer
to
ruby
the
smell
is
of
ginger
maybe
a
little
nutmeg
no
pumpkin
and
the
malt
is
killed
by
the
ginger
cold
warm
it
matters
not
the
taste
is
over
ginger
ale
with
food
coloring
and
some
alcohol
the
malt
is
hiding
and
wont
come
out
and
i
cant
blame
it
the
mouthfeel
is
that
of
soda
to
much
carbonation
yuck
no
thanks
see
you
next
year
maybe
pours
a
copperamber
color
mostly
clear
one
finger
offwhite
head
shrinks
to
a
thin
cap
and
weak
lacing
cinnamon
and
allspice
aromas
with
only
traces
of
toasted
malt
similiar
taste
with
the
spices
making
up
much
of
the
flavor
fresh
pumpkin
vanilla
extract
and
a
strong
ginger
character
take
the
lead
complimenting
the
lighty
toasted
malt
and
well
balanced
hops
and
ending
with
a
semidry
phenolic
aftertaste
the
smooth
low
carbonated
medium
body
finishes
with
some
pleasent
clinging
spiciness
the
appeallng
taste
and
drinkability
make
this
a
good
choice
for
a
fall
session
ale
i
prefer
most
styles
of
beer
as
cold
or
colder
than
suggested
but
i
strongly
encourage
letting
this
sit
for
10
minutes
outside
of
your
fridge
i
had
a
3
5
for
the
taste
at
first
but
its
a
4
when
its
warmer
im
glad
the
boys
at
fx
matt
decided
to
do
this
and
am
a
bit
surprised
it
took
them
this
long
while
there
are
certainly
better
examples
of
the
style
if
pumpkin
ales
are
your
thing
this
is
certainly
worth
a
try
i
dont
want
to
finish
the
6
pack
i
bought
and
hopefully
i
can
find
people
that
like
it
that
i
can
give
it
to
this
beer
was
copper
colored
and
produced
a
lovely
offwhite
creamy
head
which
lasted
throughout
sampling
good
lacing
too
light
hints
of
pumpkin
and
malt
in
the
aroma
tasted
of
light
pumpkin
and
spice
akin
to
a
pumpkin
pie
but
not
as
dramatic
or
pleasing
felt
good
in
the
mouth
and
was
nice
going
down
worth
the
try
but
nothing
too
exciting
over
all
this
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
has
a
pumpkin
flavbor
but
it
doesnt
stick
around
kinnda
watery
even
some
spices
and
hints
of
hops
in
the
after
taste
there
is
a
mix
of
malt
as
well
both
it
all
just
kinnda
mixes
it
does
well
in
the
mix
but
like
i
said
nothing
overly
impressive
mouthfeel
is
mild
crisp
at
the
start
and
finish
the
finish
is
slighty
dry
and
the
spices
softly
lingers
on
the
tongue
very
nice
drinkability
as
this
is
a
little
lighter
bodied
than
some
other
pumpkin
ales
i
was
surprising
impressed
as
this
is
one
of
the
better
saranac
brews
i
have
sampled
nice
work
saranac
not
the
best
pumpkin
ale
that
i
have
had
though
it
is
up
there
on
my
list
anyways
i
will
definitely
drink
more
of
these
in
the
future
great
pumpkin
ale
im
impressed
hopefully
theyll
role
this
out
every
year
